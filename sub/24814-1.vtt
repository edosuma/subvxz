00:21.588 --> 00:23.757
- Let me go. She needs me.

00:24.791 --> 00:25.791
Let me go.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.884
- Well look who it is.

00:41.908 --> 00:45.078
A man smart enough
to end up in cuffs.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.424
- How do you keep
it all together?

00:48.448 --> 00:49.448
Hm.

00:50.383 --> 00:53.896
Everything falling
apart in your life and

00:53.920 --> 00:55.422
still you believe.

02:31.885 --> 02:32.886
- Nice shot.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.228
Composure, you gotta
keep that composure.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.877
Come on, Rob, what
are you gonna do?

02:47.901 --> 02:49.736
What are you gonna do?

02:51.171 --> 02:52.448
Come on guys.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.049
You have to know when to
take it hard to the hole,

02:54.073 --> 02:55.584
or when to pull up and shoot.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.528
A player that doesn't know
that is not gonna play

02:57.552 --> 02:58.819
this game long.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.479
When you leave the court
at that final buzzer,

03:01.503 --> 03:03.383
you better be able to look
me in the eye and say

03:03.407 --> 03:04.260
that you give it all.

03:04.284 --> 03:07.563
All you had, is
left on the floor.

03:07.587 --> 03:09.165
Give us strength to fight,

03:09.189 --> 03:13.002
to the last man to the
last play to the last bell

03:13.026 --> 03:13.836
we fight.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.004
- We fight.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.171
- We fight.
- We fight.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.339
- We fight.
- We fight.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.507
- We fight.
- We fight.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.675
- We fight.
- We fight.

03:19.699 --> 03:20.843
- We fight.
- We fight.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.011
- We fight.
- We fight.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.178
- We fight.
- We fight.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.146
- We fight.
- We fight.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.170
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.026
- I'll catch up with you.
- Bye.

04:11.050 --> 04:11.860
- Hey coach.

04:11.884 --> 04:13.219
- What's up man?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.000
What's going on?

04:18.024 --> 04:19.543
What, you want me to
walk you to class?

04:19.567 --> 04:21.236
What's on your mind?

04:22.862 --> 04:24.030
- It's my dad.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.132
He's a punk.

04:27.934 --> 04:28.934
Sometimes,

04:31.237 --> 04:35.017
sometimes I just want
to punch him, you know?

04:35.041 --> 04:36.042
He's just...

04:37.277 --> 04:38.344
He's so sick.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.490
- Sick how, man.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.320
- Kurt.

04:54.861 --> 04:55.861
Sit down.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.975
I'm just thinking to myself,
when was the last time

04:59.999 --> 05:03.012
that we had a father son chat?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.713
- I can't recall, sir.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.072
- Neither can I.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.011
So, how's school?

05:14.747 --> 05:16.416
- It's good I guess.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.458
- Girlfriend?

05:27.493 --> 05:28.504
- No.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.139
- No?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.373
Boyfriend?

05:31.397 --> 05:32.875
- What? No.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.643
Any other questions, sir.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.835
- Kurt, relax.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.348
I'm just making sure
that I know my son.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.850
You know they say that
teenagers change, so I'm just

05:41.874 --> 05:45.854
determining the level
of your adjustment.

05:45.878 --> 05:49.458
- What do you even
know about us?

05:49.482 --> 05:51.093
- You can stop with
the histrionics.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.762
- Do you know your wife
calls her friends cry...

05:53.786 --> 05:55.397
- That's enough.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.590
- Stop it Jim.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.105
- He did that to you?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.950
- I didn't say that. I just...

06:14.974 --> 06:16.151
- Well what did you say?

06:16.175 --> 06:18.220
You better say something, what?

06:18.244 --> 06:20.012
- Never mind. Just...

06:21.280 --> 06:23.325
I tripped whatever, you know.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.752
He was yelling, I got scared.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.323
- Um.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.163
Listen, listen man.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.244
Relationships with our
parents can be very

06:42.268 --> 06:44.346
complicated, okay?

06:44.370 --> 06:47.616
They can be very
very complicated.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.153
We want to protect them a
lot of the time because

06:51.177 --> 06:52.888
they protected us right?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.557
But there comes a time when
a parent can do something

06:55.581 --> 06:57.292
that's gonna cause you to,

06:57.316 --> 07:00.153
to not see them for
over 20 years.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.290
That's, you know, tragedy.

07:05.491 --> 07:08.494
It hurts, a lot, but
it does happen.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.942
All I'm saying is
that you know, there

07:13.966 --> 07:15.468
can be a time when

07:17.103 --> 07:19.882
you shouldn't protect them.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.786
- Coach, he's a judge,
what am I supposed to do,

07:21.810 --> 07:23.051
call the cops?

07:23.075 --> 07:26.889
- I would suggest that you
pray to know what to do.

07:26.913 --> 07:28.457
- I don't know how to pray.

07:28.481 --> 07:32.652
Can you help me get the
conversation started or something?

08:10.056 --> 08:14.060
- Mr. Paul, this is Judge
Rogers, Kurt's father.

08:14.927 --> 08:17.263
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.

08:21.661 --> 08:22.941
What happened, Kurt, you been...

08:22.965 --> 08:24.479
- Judge Rogers was
in my office today

08:24.503 --> 08:26.506
before I finished lunch.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.951
- You pervert.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.420
If I find out you laid
a hand on my son.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.989
- Dude, are you
serious right now?

08:34.013 --> 08:38.183
- You do understand that praying
is against school policy?

08:41.821 --> 08:43.489
- I know the policy.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.872
- You people use religious
coercion and propaganda to

08:49.896 --> 08:52.040
brainwash kids like my boy.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.610
I presided over three cases
where so called Preachers

08:54.634 --> 08:56.211
were praying.

08:56.235 --> 08:57.079
- Dad, you're tripping.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.103
- Shut up!

09:06.012 --> 09:08.590
Don't use that kind
of language with me.

09:08.614 --> 09:11.193
I never should have brought
you to this school.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.785
God does not exist.

09:13.886 --> 09:17.833
And no so called coach is
gonna change that fact.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.468
- Well maybe he doesn't exist,

09:19.492 --> 09:21.494
because if he did exist,

09:23.896 --> 09:27.776
he wouldn't have made
you such a jerk.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.877
- Aiden, stop!

09:28.901 --> 09:30.545
Stop!

09:30.569 --> 09:34.082
Clean out your office,
get out of here.

09:35.652 --> 09:36.652
Get out of here, Aiden,

09:36.676 --> 09:37.552
get out of here.

09:37.576 --> 09:38.887
- What are you talking about?

09:38.911 --> 09:40.271
What are you doing?
- You're fired!

09:40.295 --> 09:41.823
You're fired. - I'm fired?

09:41.847 --> 09:44.626
For what? - Go!

09:44.650 --> 09:45.928
Get out of my school.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.432
- I didn't do anything, Mr.
Patterson.

09:47.456 --> 09:48.463
- You did. Go.

09:48.487 --> 09:51.833
- Mr. Patterson, those are
my boys that I coach.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.759
- Those were your boys.

09:54.504 --> 09:55.504
- Mr...

09:55.528 --> 09:57.530
- It's done.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.232
I'm sorry, go.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.500
- Mr...

10:03.402 --> 10:04.570
- Go, go home.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.482
It's time, go home.

10:07.506 --> 10:08.506
Go home.

11:03.195 --> 11:04.964
- Alright, listen up.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.143
I've got some bad news.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.712
Coach Paul's been terminated

11:10.736 --> 11:13.115
and he's not gonna coach tonight

11:13.139 --> 11:14.416
nor any further.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.653
I'll have my starting
five at tip off.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.322
Everybody be ready.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.186
- Are you serious?

11:46.772 --> 11:50.285
- Hey lawyer, who doesn't
answer the phone.

11:50.309 --> 11:52.029
Calling to let you know
that we're not doing

11:52.053 --> 11:54.222
business with you anymore.

11:54.947 --> 11:57.325
Your line's closed,

11:57.349 --> 12:00.295
and you need to get out of
this thing before you end

12:00.319 --> 12:01.654
up getting hurt.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.238
- Everybody's sweating bullets.

12:10.262 --> 12:13.475
Weaves going back and oh...

12:13.499 --> 12:14.676
One girl's had separated,

12:14.700 --> 12:17.045
it looked like two
different people.

12:19.705 --> 12:23.709
I'm telling you, I would've
been so embarrassed.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.154
- Oh my God.

12:26.178 --> 12:29.591
- Miss Lilly, on
a church Sunday,

12:29.615 --> 12:31.951
fell out with a heat stroke.

12:33.119 --> 12:35.697
Roll it went up over her head.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.623
It was so embarrassing.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.860
Oh, Lord, I mean,

12:42.628 --> 12:46.799
it is so hot and we can't
get a drop from the sky.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.711
- It hasn't been
this bad for years.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.213
- It really hasn't.

12:51.237 --> 12:54.249
I mean, I can't remember when
we had a drought like this.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.273
It was...

12:56.509 --> 12:57.509
Oh...

12:58.421 --> 12:59.421
- What?

12:59.445 --> 13:01.347
- You know when it was?

13:02.348 --> 13:05.417
That summer I found
out I had a twin.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.565
And I would sit under that
big old live oak tree.

13:10.589 --> 13:14.269
I said, "God you just saving
your tears until I find"

13:14.293 --> 13:16.905
my baby brother and then
you going rain down those

13:16.929 --> 13:18.807
cool tears of joy.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.809
Baby brother, shoot.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.043
Dog gone it.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.279
- Well you are five
minutes older than me.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.147
- Well how do you know?

13:25.171 --> 13:26.648
I'm gonna check the records.

13:26.672 --> 13:29.251
You better stop talking
that older sister stuff,

13:29.275 --> 13:30.552
thank you, Bill.

13:30.576 --> 13:34.222
- We found out we liked the
same flavor ice cream.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.015
- I know, it's crazy.

13:37.059 --> 13:38.059
Both hate okra.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.561
- Oh you know it's true.

13:39.585 --> 13:40.896
Can't stand it.

13:44.990 --> 13:45.990
- Hm mm mm.

13:51.730 --> 13:52.730
Hmm.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.404
So how's the practice going?

13:59.405 --> 14:01.840
- It's good, doing very good.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.012
- And my case?

14:08.581 --> 14:09.581
- Good.

14:12.151 --> 14:15.664
You know, I filed
all the papers.

14:15.688 --> 14:20.502
I just keep waiting and
waiting for the trial date.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.526
- Well it's filed and that's
good, that's progress.

14:22.550 --> 14:23.338
That's really good.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.362
Yeah.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.637
So how you doing for money?

14:32.571 --> 14:33.571
- I'm good.

14:36.976 --> 14:40.422
Well I could use a little
loan if you've got it.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.891
Just until the next
settlement comes in.

14:42.915 --> 14:43.915
- Michael,

14:44.950 --> 14:48.020
you know I don't put
icing on cornbread.

14:49.121 --> 14:50.189
No, I cannot.

14:52.358 --> 14:55.737
You know I invested
all my savings

14:55.761 --> 14:59.975
on the case for son and all those
experts you said I needed.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.611
I don't know if you know
but all of that came

15:02.635 --> 15:03.969
out of my house.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.986
- And you will get it back.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.087
- When?
- Off the top.

15:12.111 --> 15:15.114
- When? It's been
two years Michael.

15:16.048 --> 15:19.060
- Laurel, some of these
things take time.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.796
- Well I don't have time.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.698
Because now the bank is
making rumblings about

15:23.722 --> 15:25.057
taking my house.

15:26.558 --> 15:30.129
- How much does the bank say
they want to save your house?

15:36.402 --> 15:38.837
- $10,400, can you find that?

15:47.012 --> 15:50.525
- I'm not gonna let anybody
take that house from you.

15:50.549 --> 15:51.549
Okay?

15:52.484 --> 15:53.484
Nobody.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.032
- Promise?

15:57.056 --> 15:58.057
- I promise.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.592
- In Jesus name.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.597
I believe in you.

16:10.869 --> 16:13.872
I don't want this
ice cream to melt.

17:04.056 --> 17:07.659
- You know they can't
keep a good man down.

17:10.496 --> 17:11.496
Tonight.

17:12.664 --> 17:16.810
Princeton, Memphis, Oregon,
FSU, those will be easy.

17:16.835 --> 17:20.672
Thanks for that, hope you
still got the touch.

17:26.779 --> 17:27.989
- Excuse me?

17:28.012 --> 17:30.258
You that lawyer, with
all the ads everywhere?

17:30.282 --> 17:31.726
- That would be me.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.261
Michael Brown.

17:33.285 --> 17:35.530
- Do you like
throwing money away?

17:35.554 --> 17:36.865
- Excuse me?

17:36.889 --> 17:39.601
- All those games you
picked, they're all wrong.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.270
Princeton is, Charmin soft.

17:42.294 --> 17:44.773
Oregon is fast, they
can't shoot the ball.

17:44.797 --> 17:48.510
Memphis just got a new
coach, what are you doing?

17:48.534 --> 17:52.704
Florida State, they need to
stick to playing football.

17:57.887 --> 17:58.887
- Aiden Paul.

17:58.911 --> 17:59.911
- Yeah.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.147
Thank you.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.290
- Hey, thanks.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.569
In case you need a good lawyer.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.371
- Water, coffee, or juice?

18:16.395 --> 18:17.395
- Water and

18:18.797 --> 18:20.899
I'll have the light menu.

18:34.646 --> 18:37.316
- Can you cover this?

18:47.459 --> 18:48.670
- Thank you.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.638
- Any time brother.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.441
- Thanks for taking care
of the boys today, Ray.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.143
- We missed you.

18:55.167 --> 18:58.646
We got outscored by 20
in the second half.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.685
- This thing's got me
thrown, I mean, really.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.787
I got no idea how he could've
found out about that

19:05.811 --> 19:08.990
on the same day, I mean it
doesn't make any sense.

19:09.014 --> 19:10.014
- I know.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.835
- You did?

19:20.859 --> 19:21.859
- Yeah.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.096
Look man,

19:26.231 --> 19:27.231
I feel bad.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.512
I was hoping,

19:30.536 --> 19:34.215
this might help you
get on your feet.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.517
Just read it.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.519
The lady's a good lady,

19:37.543 --> 19:39.854
and it's a private school
and all, but I mean,

19:39.878 --> 19:40.878
it's a gig.

20:04.803 --> 20:06.523
- Then they started to
concentrate, but they

20:06.547 --> 20:09.417
didn't have to concentrate
under pressure.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.819
This is a big deal
right here for this...

20:11.843 --> 20:15.914
- Kansas just used
its last time out.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.860
- Oh.

20:18.884 --> 20:22.387
- He backed off as well. Wow.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.836
- He's got one more,
Kansas at the very least

20:28.860 --> 20:33.107
will have a shot to tie
with 10.8 seconds.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.617
- Kansas has made only
two three on the night.

20:42.641 --> 20:46.487
They must make one here
to extend the game.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.590
Thomson driving, almost
lost the handle.

20:48.614 --> 20:52.560
Chambers for the tie,

20:52.584 --> 20:54.429
Unbelievable.

20:54.453 --> 20:58.299
Dosier at mid court, for
the championship no, we're

20:58.323 --> 21:01.235
going into overtime
in San Antonio.

21:01.259 --> 21:04.138
Jim the free throws did it.

21:04.162 --> 21:07.208
It put Memphis in this position.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.006
- In Heaven.

21:17.676 --> 21:19.678
Beyond my understanding.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.547
My faith is in you.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.761
- What's up, Coach?

22:33.785 --> 22:35.220
- What's up, man?

22:37.956 --> 22:40.116
- Come on, man. Stop acting
like you ain't happy to see

22:40.140 --> 22:41.669
us or something.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.805
I know you miss getting
down with us, huh?

22:43.829 --> 22:45.597
I know you miss that.

22:46.975 --> 22:47.975
What's up, Coach?

22:47.999 --> 22:49.811
- Coach!

22:49.835 --> 22:51.245
- What's up, Coach?

22:51.269 --> 22:52.270
- What's up?

22:58.977 --> 22:59.978
- Hey Coach.

23:01.279 --> 23:02.714
- What's up, man?

23:12.357 --> 23:14.602
Look guys, the important
thing is is that

23:14.626 --> 23:16.128
you stay together,

23:17.329 --> 23:19.741
right, because you're a team.

23:19.765 --> 23:22.210
That's what a team does,
a team stays together,

23:22.234 --> 23:23.802
no matter what. So,

23:25.670 --> 23:27.115
no excuses.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.474
- Look, this Coach Clemmins.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.453
I have no idea what he's doing,

23:32.477 --> 23:34.088
and I don't think he does.

23:34.112 --> 23:36.157
- Hey coach, for real.

23:36.181 --> 23:37.759
They did you wrong.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.460
They did you real wrong.

23:39.484 --> 23:41.429
I don't know if we can

23:41.453 --> 23:43.498
do this without you on
the sidelines, man.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.233
- Yeah you can, man.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.324
Yeah you can.

23:49.361 --> 23:50.404
Well, you know man,

23:50.428 --> 23:53.007
there's no place I'd rather be,

23:53.031 --> 23:54.742
you know that.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.612
You believe that when
I say that right?

23:57.636 --> 23:58.636
But,

23:59.638 --> 24:01.883
it's out of my control.

24:01.907 --> 24:04.085
- Coach, you can sue them.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.888
- No, man, everybody
wants to file a lawsuit.

24:06.912 --> 24:09.190
That's not me. I'm not
filing a lawsuit.

24:09.214 --> 24:12.627
- So you're just gonna
sit back and accept it?

24:12.651 --> 24:16.264
Just gonna sit back
and do nothing?

24:16.288 --> 24:19.066
- No I'm actually
looking for a job, man.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.468
- How's that job,

24:20.492 --> 24:24.372
get you back on the
sidelines with us coach?

24:24.396 --> 24:26.641
- I guess it doesn't Ron.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.276
- You told us to never give up.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.845
Go for our goals, our
dreams, everything.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.747
And now look at you.

24:32.771 --> 24:34.248
What are you gonna do?

24:34.272 --> 24:35.883
- All that,

24:35.907 --> 24:38.419
all that talk about us

24:38.443 --> 24:40.855
being part of a team,

24:40.879 --> 24:44.725
all that talk about us
being like your sons,

24:44.749 --> 24:46.694
just talk right?

24:46.718 --> 24:48.119
Just tough, talk.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.973
- Seeing as life is
really complicated okay?

24:58.997 --> 25:01.108
You don't know that
because you're

25:01.132 --> 25:04.069
16, 17 years old
but, it really is.

25:06.171 --> 25:09.083
Tried everything I could.

25:09.107 --> 25:12.110
- I think it's pretty
simple, coach.

25:13.144 --> 25:14.913
You always taught us,

25:16.047 --> 25:17.047
to fight.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.020
You always taught
us to play hard.

25:23.154 --> 25:27.902
And now that it's time for
you to fight and play hard,

25:27.926 --> 25:29.904
you just punk out.

25:29.928 --> 25:30.928
- Punk out?

25:55.987 --> 25:58.532
I love all you guys, but
you gotta go alright?

25:58.556 --> 25:59.556
I'm...

26:01.826 --> 26:04.071
I'm not your coach
anymore, okay?

26:04.095 --> 26:07.165
- You kicking us out now?

26:08.767 --> 26:09.767
- Come on.

26:25.984 --> 26:28.629
- I knew you were nothing

26:28.653 --> 26:29.653
but a fake,

26:30.755 --> 26:33.167
white boy pretender.

26:33.191 --> 26:35.427
- Man, get out of my house.

26:46.371 --> 26:48.082
My house.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.106
My house.

28:10.855 --> 28:11.855
- Hey.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.260
You're the swami.

28:16.561 --> 28:20.007
You were right about
those games, you know?

28:20.031 --> 28:22.209
- Yeah, you were right too,

28:22.233 --> 28:25.079
I think I might need a lawyer.

28:25.103 --> 28:26.171
- Let's talk.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.116
- I saw your sign out there,

28:29.140 --> 28:30.785
on the road,

28:30.809 --> 28:32.353
and in the diner,

28:32.377 --> 28:35.046
and then I found your card here.

28:39.584 --> 28:42.897
Three times, do you know
the significance of that?

28:42.921 --> 28:44.598
- I can't say that I do.

28:44.622 --> 28:48.302
- Oh, it's the Holy Trinity,
Jesus died and then

28:48.326 --> 28:50.538
rose on the third day,

28:50.562 --> 28:53.307
there's 27 books of the Bible
which is three to the third

28:53.331 --> 28:54.108
power...

28:54.132 --> 28:56.477
- 66 books in the Bible.

28:56.501 --> 28:57.501
- Right.

28:58.603 --> 29:01.515
- 27 in the New Testament.

29:01.539 --> 29:05.186
- Alright, well 66 is still
a multiple of three and

29:05.210 --> 29:09.056
Jesus prayed three times in
the Garden of Gethsemane.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.558
Before his arrest. - Okay.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.859
- After that...
- Okay, okay

29:11.883 --> 29:13.828
I get it. Three's a sign.

29:13.852 --> 29:14.862
- Right.

29:14.886 --> 29:15.886
- Look.

29:17.388 --> 29:21.226
I don't even know if I
believe there is a God.

29:22.694 --> 29:26.865
But I sure know you can't
pray with kids in schools.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.010
- You ever try that?

29:30.034 --> 29:31.445
- Praying?

29:31.469 --> 29:32.469
Who hasn't?

29:34.706 --> 29:36.750
- What'd you ask for?

29:36.774 --> 29:37.751
- For what?

29:37.775 --> 29:38.986
- For what?

29:39.010 --> 29:41.288
- That I wouldn't have
a wife that cheated.

29:41.312 --> 29:42.623
- And?

29:42.647 --> 29:44.325
- I'm divorced.

29:44.349 --> 29:46.694
- Because she cheated?

29:46.718 --> 29:47.718
- No.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.520
- You did.

29:57.095 --> 29:59.664
- I don't think I can help you.

30:01.132 --> 30:04.178
- Counselor, what do
you want most in life?

30:04.202 --> 30:06.104
- Make money, be happy.

30:09.374 --> 30:11.476
- Well, all I want to do,

30:13.178 --> 30:14.279
is help kids.

30:15.413 --> 30:18.016
I want to help boys become men.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.795
To coach them and help them,
it's the only thing I know

30:21.819 --> 30:22.963
how to do.

30:22.987 --> 30:26.567
That's what I'm good
at, that's my calling

30:26.591 --> 30:28.026
is to do that and

30:29.427 --> 30:31.505
that's why I'm here right
now, is because a kid came

30:31.529 --> 30:33.031
to me for help and

30:34.532 --> 30:36.877
and I gave it to him,

30:36.901 --> 30:39.980
the best way I know how, the
only way I knew how to help him

30:40.004 --> 30:43.908
and they took everything
away from me for that.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.414
So I'm here now asking

30:50.315 --> 30:52.293
for your help,

30:52.317 --> 30:55.429
and yeah, you would be putting
your neck out on the line,

30:55.453 --> 30:58.132
but that's what I did for
somebody who needed help

30:58.156 --> 31:00.592
and that's why I'm here so...

31:07.065 --> 31:09.834
Come on, let's
make some history.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.734
- I need a retainer.

31:33.758 --> 31:36.637
Up front in case you
have a crisis of faith.

31:36.661 --> 31:39.039
I'll do the rest on contingency.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.999
- How much do you need?

31:42.267 --> 31:43.267
- $10,500.

31:45.003 --> 31:47.003
- Mr. Brown, I'm unemployed,
I don't have access to

31:47.027 --> 31:48.595
that kind of money.

31:50.508 --> 31:53.177
- I can't do it for free, swami.

32:02.153 --> 32:04.989
- Would you take $5000, Mr.
Brown?

32:37.188 --> 32:38.690
- Michael?

32:43.161 --> 32:44.872
- What are you doing here?

32:44.896 --> 32:46.607
How did you know where I was?

32:46.631 --> 32:49.634
- Do you realize
what you are doing?

32:50.935 --> 32:53.781
I just want to pay my score.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.616
They're gonna make me
tell them everything.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.141
Everything I know.

32:58.576 --> 33:00.421
You should check your office.

33:00.445 --> 33:01.555
- Why?

33:01.579 --> 33:04.058
- They left a message.

33:59.504 --> 34:01.849
- You know you give
a person a chance

34:01.873 --> 34:04.618
and they just take advantage
of you, today you just

34:04.642 --> 34:07.287
can't be nice, didn't want
to listen to the pretty face

34:07.311 --> 34:08.722
that you got involved,

34:08.746 --> 34:11.492
after you knew your
line was closed.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.393
I want my money.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.362
And whatever happens to
the people you love,

34:15.386 --> 34:16.621
that's all you.

34:34.205 --> 34:37.484
- We should go, get out of here.

34:37.507 --> 34:38.507
- Go?

34:39.210 --> 34:40.353
Go where?

34:40.378 --> 34:42.547
- Anywhere, just not here.

34:45.349 --> 34:46.583
A vacation, hm?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.206
I mean you spend all your
time around these old things

34:51.231 --> 34:52.299
nobody wants.

34:53.357 --> 34:55.636
- Oh, so I guess
I'm nobody, huh?

34:55.659 --> 34:58.038
- Well I didn't mean nobody.

34:58.062 --> 35:02.209
I just meant we should
be, more spontaneous.

35:02.233 --> 35:03.233
Leave.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.146
- I have to work.

35:06.170 --> 35:07.772
- You own the shop.

35:09.006 --> 35:11.509
- And I need $10,400 remember?

35:13.878 --> 35:14.979
- I remember.

35:16.247 --> 35:19.092
But a few days won't hurt.

35:19.116 --> 35:22.463
I mean the case is gonna
be settled real soon.

35:22.487 --> 35:23.487
- It will?

35:24.489 --> 35:25.489
- It will.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.506
- Michael look at me.

35:32.530 --> 35:35.576
In my eyes and tell me you
think this case is gonna

35:35.600 --> 35:36.934
be settled soon.

35:38.870 --> 35:39.870
- It will.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.585
- We're the same.

35:44.609 --> 35:46.010
Exactly same DNA.

35:49.157 --> 35:50.157
- It will.

35:50.181 --> 35:51.182
- Michael...

36:26.684 --> 36:27.995
- This is a...

36:28.019 --> 36:30.855
- I've known about
it for a while.

36:31.956 --> 36:34.635
I just wanted to see how
long it was gonna take

36:34.659 --> 36:36.994
for you to tell me about it.

36:42.043 --> 36:43.043
- Why didn't you...

36:43.067 --> 36:44.067
- Why?

36:48.940 --> 36:51.084
Because with people you love,

36:51.108 --> 36:53.611
you tend to be more forgiving.

36:55.346 --> 36:59.159
But I just kept hoping that
you would do something,

36:59.183 --> 37:01.595
do something to make it right.

37:01.619 --> 37:02.619
- Laurel...

37:10.194 --> 37:12.239
- And you want me to leave,

37:12.263 --> 37:13.273
my life.

37:13.297 --> 37:15.842
You look around here and

37:15.866 --> 37:19.112
you see old stuff,
but I see treasures.

37:19.136 --> 37:22.683
The people who made
all this stuff,

37:22.707 --> 37:26.253
they've long since passed,
but what they put their

37:26.277 --> 37:27.277
hands to

37:28.446 --> 37:29.447
is treasure.

37:31.782 --> 37:36.430
That's their legacy and I
used to have one of my own.

37:36.454 --> 37:40.124
That died in that car
accident, so right now.

37:41.292 --> 37:44.838
I just want to make
their legacy live on

37:44.862 --> 37:45.862
right here.

37:49.734 --> 37:52.336
So no, I don't need a vacation.

37:53.404 --> 37:55.406
I am where I need to be.

37:58.209 --> 38:00.320
- I'll pay you back.

38:00.344 --> 38:01.344
Every cent.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.886
- I have to work.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.991
- Laurel, I'll pay you back.

38:14.925 --> 38:15.925
I promise.

38:19.730 --> 38:20.730
I promise.

38:30.941 --> 38:31.941
- Oh God.

38:34.512 --> 38:37.324
- That's my sister, my heart.

38:37.348 --> 38:39.893
I did this to her,
I got to fix it.

38:39.917 --> 38:41.352
I'm gonna fix it.

38:42.753 --> 38:43.753
Watch me.

38:51.762 --> 38:53.006
- I pledge allegiance

38:53.030 --> 38:56.109
to the flag of the United
States of America,

38:56.133 --> 38:59.112
and to the republic
for which it stands

38:59.136 --> 39:03.383
one nation indivisible with
liberty and justice for all.

39:03.407 --> 39:04.742
Have a nice day.

39:05.776 --> 39:06.777
- Under God.

39:08.779 --> 39:10.114
- Do I know you?

39:11.582 --> 39:12.583
- Under God.

39:14.418 --> 39:16.596
One nation under God.

39:16.620 --> 39:19.633
Approved by Congress in 1954,

39:19.657 --> 39:23.828
is there a specific reason
you excluded that phrase?

39:27.431 --> 39:29.333
Oh, you've been served,

39:30.434 --> 39:32.913
by Michael Brown,
attorney at law.

39:32.937 --> 39:35.539
Mr. Paul will see you in court.

39:42.913 --> 39:45.158
- And the plaintiff should
be allowed a hearing

39:45.182 --> 39:47.027
for immediate reinstatement.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.930
My client's season will be
nearly over in 60 days,

39:49.954 --> 39:51.098
your Honor.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.433
- My client needs more
time for discovery.

39:53.457 --> 39:55.102
We need more time.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.803
Six months is what
we're thinking.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.138
- Six...

39:58.162 --> 40:01.208
Your Honor, this hearing
should take place this week.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.577
- That's not feasible and
besides that's absurd.

40:03.601 --> 40:05.112
- That is not absurd...

40:05.136 --> 40:07.147
- I have heard from both
of you upwards of an hour,

40:07.171 --> 40:09.349
you want to forever try the
case to make the plaintiff

40:09.373 --> 40:10.917
suffer, and you

40:10.941 --> 40:13.061
want to catch them with their
pants down so they can't

40:13.085 --> 40:14.755
prepare properly.

40:14.779 --> 40:17.624
Both positions strategically
valid, both positions

40:17.648 --> 40:18.992
logically flawed.

40:19.016 --> 40:22.229
Gentlemen, you have 30 days
to complete discovery.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.064
Trial begins in another 30 days,

40:24.088 --> 40:26.466
I'm sorry if you're client
has to miss his basketball

40:26.490 --> 40:30.237
season but my docket does not
revolve around basketball.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.021
And I'm sorry if you're
client has to work to

40:32.045 --> 40:34.574
prepare for trial but
sometimes counselor,

40:34.598 --> 40:36.877
that's the way it goes.

40:36.901 --> 40:38.636
Thank you, gentlemen.

40:39.537 --> 40:40.580
- Thank you your Honor.

40:40.604 --> 40:41.481
- Thank you your Honor.

40:41.505 --> 40:42.907
- You're welcome.

40:58.322 --> 41:00.267
- I had hoped you'd be a
little more sympathetic

41:00.291 --> 41:02.893
to my client's case your Honor.

41:03.828 --> 41:07.174
- I am a man of both fact
and faith Mr. Brown,

41:07.198 --> 41:09.709
and I would suggest you
find a strong dose of both

41:09.733 --> 41:11.836
before this trial begins.

41:32.957 --> 41:35.135
- I'm Joseph T.
Herrington, trial lawyer,

41:35.159 --> 41:37.804
Judge Rogers asked that I,

41:37.828 --> 41:40.740
that we intervene and bring
our two hundred years

41:40.764 --> 41:43.043
of collective
experience to bare.

41:43.067 --> 41:45.469
Now who is this lawyer who is

41:46.837 --> 41:49.406
shaking a stick in the beehive.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.688
Smart, filed a

41:54.712 --> 41:57.290
claim for retaliation.

41:57.314 --> 42:01.261
Doesn't depend on the success
of the underlying claim.

42:01.285 --> 42:02.353
Nevertheless.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.942
Michael Brown, Yale Law in 1985,

42:15.966 --> 42:19.513
three disciplinary complaints,
suspended for six months,

42:19.537 --> 42:21.748
last chance reinstatement.

42:21.772 --> 42:23.550
Misses deadlines.

42:23.574 --> 42:27.520
Last five years filed
65 cases, 58 settle,

42:27.544 --> 42:29.322
three lost at trial,

42:29.346 --> 42:33.017
two dismissed due to
lack of prosecution and

42:33.851 --> 42:36.930
one little victory for a
rear end car accident,

42:36.954 --> 42:37.955
verdict, uh,

42:40.190 --> 42:41.190
$2,500

42:44.161 --> 42:47.474
We will not simply
scorch the earth,

42:47.498 --> 42:50.610
they'll be no settlement,
they'll be no compromise,

42:50.634 --> 42:52.469
they'll be no way out.

42:53.470 --> 42:54.470
Still,

42:55.773 --> 42:57.784
you go get me a

42:57.808 --> 43:00.353
settlement conference with Mr.

43:00.377 --> 43:01.545
Michael Brown.

43:11.789 --> 43:12.856
- Aiden Paul?

43:16.293 --> 43:17.293
Aiden?

43:33.177 --> 43:35.257
- The first amendment does
not give coaches the right

43:35.281 --> 43:37.657
to impose their religion
on their students either.

43:37.681 --> 43:39.592
Coaches are
government employees,

43:39.616 --> 43:42.095
when they are coaching, they
are bound by the establishment

43:42.119 --> 43:44.097
clause of the first amendment.

43:44.121 --> 43:47.000
This means that they cannot
encourage, organize,

43:47.024 --> 43:48.702
or participate in prayer.

43:48.726 --> 43:50.670
When they get home,
they can pray,

43:50.694 --> 43:54.865
but whenever they coach,
they coach and not preach.

43:57.835 --> 44:00.947
- You know, you've managed
to divide the community

44:00.971 --> 44:02.682
in a way I haven't
seen I a while.

44:02.706 --> 44:05.919
Your resume is impressive
but I must say,

44:05.943 --> 44:07.854
and I'm not one to
beat around the bush,

44:07.878 --> 44:11.782
there is no one in the
state who will hire you.

44:17.788 --> 44:19.857
- Aiden Paul?

44:21.135 --> 44:22.135
- Good afternoon.

44:22.159 --> 44:24.604
- How may I help you?

44:24.628 --> 44:27.741
- This is my first time here,
so I don't really know what

44:27.765 --> 44:31.945
to do but I have to apply
for unemployment benefits.

44:31.969 --> 44:34.914
- Fill out these forms and
wait over there. Next.

44:34.938 --> 44:37.984
- Ma'am, I'm sorry I'm not
trying to violate any thing,

44:38.008 --> 44:42.179
but I've just been waiting
in line for three hours.

44:46.683 --> 44:48.118
- Denied.

44:55.025 --> 44:56.627
- You lost Michael.

44:58.328 --> 45:00.330
Don't let this escalate.

45:03.067 --> 45:06.379
It won't be good
for either of us.

45:06.403 --> 45:08.238
- I'll have the money.

45:09.406 --> 45:11.751
Long before it's due.

45:11.775 --> 45:12.775
Guaranteed.

45:43.507 --> 45:44.507
- Hi.

45:45.709 --> 45:47.220
- Hey.

45:47.244 --> 45:49.155
I've been looking for
you for over a week.

45:49.179 --> 45:50.523
Trial's around the corner,

45:50.547 --> 45:53.193
I'm meeting with the defense
in less than 24 hours.

45:53.217 --> 45:54.094
- I've been busy.

45:54.118 --> 45:55.361
- Your phones off.

45:55.385 --> 45:57.105
- I'm staying at a
friend's house right now.

45:57.129 --> 45:59.898
And I don't need
that extra bill.

46:00.924 --> 46:03.870
- Well good news and
bad, which first?

46:03.894 --> 46:05.305
- Um,

46:05.329 --> 46:06.372
I don't know why don't we
let the good news drown out

46:06.396 --> 46:08.274
the bad news?

46:08.298 --> 46:09.743
- Alright bad.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.579
The firm of Herrington Smith
and Hail took over the case.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.748
We drew the partner Joseph
Herrington, he's tough.

46:15.772 --> 46:18.685
Hasn't lost a trial in 20 years.

46:18.709 --> 46:20.620
- So we can't win?

46:20.644 --> 46:22.722
- Oh yeah, yeah we can beat him.

46:22.746 --> 46:24.224
But we may not have to.

46:24.248 --> 46:25.458
That's the good news.

46:25.482 --> 46:28.719
They called, wanted
to talk settlement.

46:29.753 --> 46:31.464
- Well that's...

46:31.488 --> 46:33.433
That's a good thing, right?

46:33.457 --> 46:35.526
- Good? That's very good.

46:36.426 --> 46:38.805
- See I pushed for this
trial to come up fast,

46:38.829 --> 46:40.273
that put pressure on them,

46:40.297 --> 46:42.257
they don't want to put their
resources in this and

46:42.281 --> 46:44.878
know that it's bad PR so,

46:44.902 --> 46:47.671
they want me to
come by tomorrow.

46:48.805 --> 46:52.652
- Like a get my job back,
like very soon, good thing?

46:52.676 --> 46:55.555
- I told them if getting your
job back wasn't on the table

46:55.579 --> 46:56.923
we wouldn't talk.

46:56.947 --> 46:58.958
They said let's talk.

46:58.982 --> 47:01.251
It'll all be over tomorrow.

47:14.565 --> 47:16.910
- Sorry, after conferring
with my client we decline to

47:16.934 --> 47:18.101
make an offer.

47:25.242 --> 47:28.321
- You never had any
plans to settle.

47:28.345 --> 47:31.658
That's considered deception,
deceit, old fashioned lying.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.927
- I did no such thing, there's
always a possibility,

47:33.951 --> 47:37.497
albeit a lower than
slight chance, but

47:37.521 --> 47:39.189
anything's possible.

47:40.457 --> 47:41.457
- Well.

47:42.893 --> 47:46.539
If that's the way you
want to play it.

47:46.563 --> 47:49.709
- You're really not gonna
dismiss this suit are you?

47:49.733 --> 47:51.010
- I don't quit.

47:51.034 --> 47:53.413
- After you learn a few
things about your client,

47:53.437 --> 47:56.950
I'm sure that withdrawing
might be a smart move.

47:56.974 --> 48:00.978
- Patience prevents me
from folding prematurely.

48:02.546 --> 48:04.624
- I got to give you
a little credit.

48:04.648 --> 48:07.060
Realizing that if you argue
the merits that the actual

48:07.084 --> 48:11.097
constitutionality, the
prayer, you lose so instead,

48:11.121 --> 48:12.632
you plead retaliation.

48:12.656 --> 48:15.401
That may get you an A in
my common law class but

48:15.425 --> 48:19.372
in the end, these are
little consequence here.

48:19.396 --> 48:21.040
- That's presumptuous.

48:21.064 --> 48:22.499
- Provatic maybe.

48:23.867 --> 48:24.867
Reality is

48:25.669 --> 48:27.337
if you argue prayer,

48:28.939 --> 48:29.939
you lose.

48:32.442 --> 48:35.989
- I'll take that
under consideration.

48:36.013 --> 48:39.092
- You realize this trial
starts in two weeks?

48:39.116 --> 48:40.860
Per your request?

48:40.884 --> 48:43.129
- That's fine counselor.

48:43.153 --> 48:45.198
I wouldn't mind
hastening the headline,

48:45.222 --> 48:47.734
Joseph Herrington loses.

48:47.758 --> 48:49.259
Now that headline,

48:50.127 --> 48:51.361
I'd toiler for.

48:52.429 --> 48:53.429
- T.

48:54.631 --> 48:56.366
Joseph T. Herrington.

48:57.467 --> 48:59.045
Not Joseph Herrington
the plumber,

48:59.069 --> 49:00.880
Joseph Herrington
sanitary worker,

49:00.904 --> 49:03.883
Joseph T Herrington, litigator,

49:03.907 --> 49:05.685
that's something you
seem to forget.

49:05.709 --> 49:08.821
There will be no settlement.

49:08.845 --> 49:10.456
- Very well.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.215
Joseph Herrington. T.

49:15.419 --> 49:17.563
- With your client and his
lawyer, I would expect this

49:17.587 --> 49:21.034
to be the shortest
deliberation in history.

49:21.058 --> 49:22.058
We're done.

49:37.941 --> 49:39.552
- $5,000.

49:39.576 --> 49:40.576
One hand.

51:29.186 --> 51:33.099
I wasn't sure if I
should run or slug you.

51:33.123 --> 51:35.163
- You said that you wanted
to talk so I hope you got

51:35.187 --> 51:36.235
some good news for me.

51:36.259 --> 51:37.870
- You should've made
an appointment.

51:37.894 --> 51:39.806
My life doesn't revolve
around this case.

51:39.830 --> 51:43.309
- I never seen another soul
anywhere near this office.

51:43.333 --> 51:45.378
Hopefully we'll just be
back to normal living,

51:45.402 --> 51:47.042
you know as soon as we
get the settlement.

51:47.066 --> 51:48.667
Thank God for that.

51:52.409 --> 51:55.254
- You lost your job,
your house, your team,

51:55.278 --> 51:56.422
your record,

51:56.446 --> 51:58.115
still you thank God.

52:01.084 --> 52:03.587
You lost your job for praying.

52:04.454 --> 52:08.201
If prayer was so powerful,
wouldn't you still be working?

52:08.225 --> 52:09.335
- What am I supposed to do?

52:09.359 --> 52:11.971
Just be faithful when I am

52:11.995 --> 52:13.830
rolling in the riches,

52:14.865 --> 52:15.865
balling,

52:16.833 --> 52:17.833
on top.

52:19.903 --> 52:21.805
- They're not settling.

52:27.277 --> 52:29.212
- They're not settling?

52:30.747 --> 52:32.649
- They're not settling.

52:33.884 --> 52:35.804
- That's funny because I
thought that you told me

52:35.828 --> 52:37.563
they called you

52:37.587 --> 52:41.167
and said that they
wanted to settle.

52:41.191 --> 52:42.735
- They called,

52:42.759 --> 52:44.203
but they snuck me.

52:44.227 --> 52:45.228
- Snuck you?

52:47.397 --> 52:50.910
Oh I see so they outsmarted
you is what you're saying.

52:50.934 --> 52:53.813
- Say it any way you want.

52:53.837 --> 52:56.339
But that's not the worst part.

52:57.741 --> 52:59.619
- That's not the worst part?

52:59.643 --> 53:02.054
What's the worst part?

53:02.078 --> 53:06.359
- No matter what happens,
just keep praying right?

53:06.383 --> 53:09.061
- Why don't you go ahead and
tell me the worst part?

53:09.085 --> 53:10.085
- Look,

53:11.154 --> 53:12.798
you see that stack of
motions they filed.

53:12.822 --> 53:16.593
That's 50 grand in fees
sitting on that desk.

53:18.828 --> 53:21.407
- Where's your stack of motions?

53:21.431 --> 53:22.875
- You didn't pay me 50 grand.

53:22.899 --> 53:26.403
- Well what is five
grand stack look like?

53:31.141 --> 53:32.542
That's really it?

53:33.510 --> 53:35.054
That's really it?

53:35.078 --> 53:36.756
- And there's more.

53:36.780 --> 53:37.780
- More?

53:38.682 --> 53:40.726
Oh there's more?

53:40.750 --> 53:41.750
- More.

53:44.688 --> 53:46.790
- There's even more. Wow.

53:57.567 --> 53:59.078
- You should've told me.

53:59.102 --> 54:01.771
- This is supposed to be sealed.

54:06.343 --> 54:08.120
Why are you handing me this?

54:08.144 --> 54:10.723
This is sealed.

54:10.747 --> 54:11.891
This is sealed record.

54:11.915 --> 54:13.826
- If that gets in.

54:13.850 --> 54:15.061
You can't win.

54:15.085 --> 54:16.796
- What do you mean
if it gets in?

54:16.820 --> 54:19.060
It's not supposed to be in,
it's not supposed to be here,

54:19.084 --> 54:21.534
you're not supposed, no one is
ever supposed to be able to

54:21.558 --> 54:22.868
look at this.

54:22.892 --> 54:25.829
Because it's supposed
to be sealed.

54:27.897 --> 54:30.409
We're dropping this lawsuit
right now, do you understand?

54:30.433 --> 54:31.277
- Drop it?

54:31.301 --> 54:32.211
- Yeah. I can't go to trial

54:32.235 --> 54:33.479
with a lawyer... - They have it!

54:33.503 --> 54:35.263
- Who can't keep something
that was sealed as

54:35.287 --> 54:38.651
a minor record.
- Their money unsealed it.

54:38.675 --> 54:40.515
- There's no way this
should be here right now,

54:40.539 --> 54:41.587
do you understand?

54:41.611 --> 54:43.122
There's no way.

54:43.146 --> 54:44.557
- So you just want to drop it?

54:44.581 --> 54:45.691
- Yeah, that's right.

54:45.715 --> 54:47.326
- All my time.

54:47.350 --> 54:49.261
The kids are important.

54:49.285 --> 54:51.030
Et cetera and so forth.

54:51.054 --> 54:53.099
You know I don't get you, swami.

54:53.123 --> 54:54.457
I don't get you.

54:56.292 --> 54:58.471
One minute you're all about
prayer and the next minute

54:58.495 --> 55:00.172
you're ready to quit.

55:00.196 --> 55:02.274
- Ready to quit?

55:02.298 --> 55:04.810
- I'm not quitting anything,
I'm getting out of suicide

55:04.834 --> 55:06.846
right now, that's
what I'm doing.

55:06.870 --> 55:09.015
I lost my job, I lost my
bike, I lost my house,

55:09.039 --> 55:11.384
I lost my living, I
lost everything.

55:11.408 --> 55:13.048
And all I keep... I'm
waiting for answers,

55:13.072 --> 55:15.054
all I keep getting is you,
sitting here telling me

55:15.078 --> 55:16.288
it gets worse.

55:16.312 --> 55:19.191
Oh they outsmarted me. Oh.

55:19.215 --> 55:21.427
You're sealed record from
when you were 10 years old

55:21.451 --> 55:25.097
is now public because they
have money and we don't.

55:25.121 --> 55:26.356
- That's right.

55:28.024 --> 55:31.904
I tell you this so you know
what we're up against.

55:31.928 --> 55:35.532
I tell you this so that
you can understand,

55:36.366 --> 55:38.535
they're playing for keeps.

55:39.969 --> 55:40.969
You get it?

55:43.173 --> 55:44.173
You get it?

55:44.974 --> 55:46.810
And all you got is me.

55:49.079 --> 55:50.079
Hm, me.

55:51.247 --> 55:53.526
The only person crazy
enough or desperate enough

55:53.550 --> 55:55.561
to take your case.

55:55.585 --> 55:58.197
The only person who's willing
to stick their neck out

55:58.221 --> 55:59.031
for you.

55:59.055 --> 56:00.890
The only person who...

56:05.195 --> 56:07.173
You can't quit.

56:07.197 --> 56:08.365
We can't quit.

56:09.666 --> 56:11.911
I didn't tell you this to quit.

56:11.935 --> 56:14.037
I told you this to fight!

56:18.975 --> 56:21.454
Now you asked me
something the other day.

56:21.478 --> 56:23.255
You asked me did I
want to make history,

56:23.279 --> 56:26.158
well I'm telling you now.

56:26.182 --> 56:27.784
Let's make history.

56:28.752 --> 56:32.522
- What are we gonna do
about this, Mr. Brown?

57:18.668 --> 57:20.336
- Mr. Brown?

57:33.450 --> 57:35.351
- Ladies and gentlemen,

57:36.319 --> 57:40.800
our legal system trust the
community to enforce the law.

57:40.824 --> 57:43.326
Today, you are that community,

57:44.627 --> 57:47.106
your job is important.

57:47.130 --> 57:48.965
And relatively simple.

57:49.899 --> 57:54.747
You have to decide if Aiden
Paul violated a rule,

57:54.771 --> 57:58.708
and whether any violation
deserved termination.

58:00.577 --> 58:01.577
Now,

58:02.912 --> 58:06.325
they will tell you that Mr.
Paul was terminated for

58:06.349 --> 58:08.184
praying with a player,

58:09.385 --> 58:14.066
and that that prayer constituted
a violation of policy,

58:14.090 --> 58:15.835
and for that,

58:15.859 --> 58:17.760
termination was proper.

58:18.995 --> 58:21.564
And then you'll hear the truth.

58:26.102 --> 58:27.203
The truth is,

58:28.504 --> 58:31.650
that Mr. Paul threatened
to report the school's

58:31.674 --> 58:34.854
principal's violations
to the Board,

58:34.878 --> 58:38.114
and later, that same
day, he was fired.

58:46.389 --> 58:49.792
Those are the facts
ladies and gentlemen.

58:51.394 --> 58:52.394
At the end,

59:05.642 --> 59:06.642
actually,

59:08.811 --> 59:10.723
the reason we're here

59:10.747 --> 59:11.747
is prayer.

59:15.451 --> 59:17.186
And where you believe

59:18.121 --> 59:20.189
it's greatest value lies.

59:23.426 --> 59:24.426
Thank you.

59:33.036 --> 59:34.246
- Oh.

59:34.270 --> 59:35.270
The truth.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.240
The truth.

59:40.243 --> 59:43.155
You know, when
someone tells you,

59:43.179 --> 59:47.326
they declare that they rely
on the truth all too often,

59:47.350 --> 59:49.352
in actuality, the truth,

59:50.453 --> 59:51.688
it evades them.

59:53.923 --> 59:56.502
Because they're so
blinded by their

59:56.526 --> 59:59.462
passionate stand
of their position.

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:06.111
Now I have no doubt that Mr.
Brown believes his client's

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:09.572
position carries the
shield of the truth.

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:15.311
But reality is far
from that barometer.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:20.059
You see in 1962, our
Supreme Court held

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:24.229
that teacher led prayer
is unconstitutional.

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.999
I'm gonna say it again,
listen very carefully.

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:30.860
The Supreme Court held
that teacher led prayer

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.898
is unconstitutional.

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:42.214
Opening up prayer in school
is akin to opening up.

01:00:42.238 --> 01:00:44.817
Pandora's box, why,
because we don't want

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:48.487
our children indoctrinated
with whatever religion,

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:52.091
whatever religion, just
happens to be popular

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:52.925
at the moment.

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:54.017
So we say no.

01:00:55.618 --> 01:00:58.731
You want to discuss those things,
you want to ask questions

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:02.034
you do it inside your own home.

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:04.894
The separation of
church and state

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:07.830
is an enforceable,

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:10.566
constitutional

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:12.467
principle.

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:18.708
Mr. Paul very simply,
violated that principle,

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.779
and the school,

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:27.216
they terminated him
for doing such.

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:35.134
That termination, you know
what that termination does?

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:38.470
It protects our children
from the undue influence of

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:41.840
people who happen to be popular.

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.943
People that our children
look up to like Mr. Paul

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:47.303
who will do anything to win.

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:53.475
Influence.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.547
People who influence
our children.

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:05.354
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, with that verdict.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.935
I want you to inform
the plaintiff,

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:13.572
I want you to inform Mr.
Paul that we as a community

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:16.332
we respect and we
uphold the law.

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:24.006
No matter how many
athletic events

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.613
you may coach to victory.

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:33.048
We respect,

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.189
and we uphold the law.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.430
Thank you.

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:03.722
- Your Honor,

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:07.183
plaintiff calls Kurt
Rogers to the stand.

01:03:34.704 --> 01:03:36.744
- It has been brought to the
court's attention that.

01:03:36.768 --> 01:03:39.625
Mr. Kurt Rodgers was never
properly served a subpoena

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:42.194
to testify in court today.

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:45.664
- Judge I was informed by the
witness that he would testify

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:47.065
today,

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:50.569
but I would move to admit
his deposition testimony.

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:53.038
- Your Honor we object to the
admission of this deposition,

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:55.240
we were not informed of
the deposition because.

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:58.477
Mr. Brown deprived the
defense the opportunity to

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.446
cross examine the witness, the
deposition is inadmissible

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.372
hearsay under rule 801.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:05.918
- Mr. Brown?

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:08.687
- I anticipated the witness
would be here to testify

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:09.711
your Honor.

01:04:11.647 --> 01:04:13.225
- Not good enough.

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:15.289
If the defense did not have
the opportunity to cross

01:04:15.313 --> 01:04:17.696
examine the witness,
the testimony,

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.388
it's not admissible.

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:30.976
- Your Honor, these witnesses
are inappropriate.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.412
The facts of this case
turn on whether Mr. Paul's

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:36.715
termination was a violation
of school policy.

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:38.819
- Your Honor, is counsel
gonna allow us to put on our

01:04:38.843 --> 01:04:41.920
case or continue these jack
in the box objections?

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:46.115
- Is opposing counsel gonna
adhere to one single rule?

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.195
- I agree with Mr. Herrington,
this case is not about.

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:52.798
Mr. Paul's character, it
is only about whether he

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:55.100
was terminated for
violating a rule,

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:57.703
or for pretexual reason.

01:04:58.561 --> 01:04:59.629
Next witness.

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:06.578
- Mr. Patterson, you
claimed that Coach Paul

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:09.681
was terminated for
praying with a student?

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:11.984
- That's correct, yes.

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:15.487
- Isn't it true that on the
same day he was terminated,

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:18.590
he informed you that he was
going to report you to the.

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:22.527
Board for the misallocation of
funds assigned to the team?

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:24.062
- Not in that way, no.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:25.530
- In what way then Mr.
Patterson?

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:26.656
- I recall he

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:30.135
mentioned some kind
of a complaint, but

01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:32.704
I don't recall him
threatening me to

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:36.408
threatening to report
me to my superiors, no.

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:39.211
- But if he was to do so on
the same day that he was

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:40.579
terminated,

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:43.048
it would look pretty bad
for you wouldn't it?

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:45.284
- Yeah, if you say so.

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:46.818
- Well did you?

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:47.719
- Did I what?

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.888
- Did you miss allocate funds?

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:52.224
- Absolutely not, sir,
and I'm insulted.

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:55.160
- Oh I'm so sorry
to insult you, sir.

01:05:55.184 --> 01:05:56.962
Do you need a moment
to gather yourself?

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:57.796
- Objection your Honor.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.097
Argumentative.

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:01.466
- Sustained. That statement
will be stricken.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:04.269
- Mr. Patterson praying
with a student

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:06.038
is not a terminable
offense is it?

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.063
- Yes it is.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.043
- According to your policies,

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:15.147
conviction of a felony,
forgery, falsifying records,

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:19.017
stealing, fighting, immoral
or indecent conduct,

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:21.520
these are listed as
terminable offenses,

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:25.590
and funny thing is, there's
no mention of prayer.

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:28.126
- It's not specifically
stated, I'll give you that,

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:31.153
it's assumed under
indecent conduct.

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:34.666
- I'm sorry.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.703
Are you saying that your
school district categorizes

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.962
prayer as indecent conduct?

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:45.410
- Yes, but not in the way
you may think however.

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:48.313
- Well pray tell
how do you do so?

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:50.582
- Indecent defined as
not being the norm,

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:53.676
not fitting, not
indecent as obscene.

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:56.822
- The definition that
you're relying upon,

01:06:56.846 --> 01:07:00.292
this definition is written
in your policies?

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:01.126
- No I don't think...

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.385
- No it is not.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.133
You would agree, Mr. Patterson,
that being transgender

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:09.534
is not the norm?

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:11.136
- Honor, objection.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.938
- A little grace your Honor.

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:14.206
- Very little.

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.540
- Yes I would agree.

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:18.410
- And there is a transgender
teacher working at your

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:22.147
school, and a parent complained
because this teacher

01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:24.483
discussed it with a student.

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:25.851
- I believe that's true, yes.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.487
- And according to
your definition,

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:32.190
not being the norm
is indecent, right?

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:34.493
- According to that
logic, I guess.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:37.028
- And that teacher
still teaches, yes?

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:39.064
- Mr. Brown, precisely
what is your point?

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.834
- My point is that you chose
to terminate Coach Paul

01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:46.004
for praying with a student
but you chose not to

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:49.141
terminate a transgender
teacher who discussed

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:52.168
their sexual identity
with students.

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.136
Mr. Patterson.

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:59.418
Tolerance and
understanding is a river,

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:02.378
that flows both up
stream and down.

01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:04.980
Does it not?

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:30.171
- Guard said it's about
that time, he's locking up.

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:37.555
- My mentor was never allowed
to enter the room down there.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.292
He and everyone that looked
like him were forced to

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:41.317
sit up here.

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.487
Argue from the balcony.

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.255
Separate.

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:53.162
- Shackled by stupidity, huh?

01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:57.166
- Shackled by stupidity.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:03.072
- So I'm up tomorrow?

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:07.542
- It comes down to you.

01:09:11.346 --> 01:09:14.091
- They can't bring up the
things about the past?

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:16.285
- No I don't think so, but

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:18.888
don't open the door.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.805
I thought you said at the
beginning of this thing that

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.207
if we argue prayer's
okay at any time,

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:31.810
then we're gonna lose?

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:32.834
100%.

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.042
- We might.

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:48.551
But what are we
really fighting for?

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.019
Just a job.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.923
- History, right?

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:59.137
- History remembers those who

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:01.597
win in a spectacular fashion.

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:04.767
Or lose in the same way.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:12.274
Either way, you and I
will be remembered.

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:25.821
- Coach?

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:28.257
Hey old man.

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:35.040
- We know you gotta
take the stand.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:39.811
- And we know you've kind of
always had our backs and...

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:42.280
- We wanted to have your back.

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:43.784
- Just don't let them
shake you coach.

01:10:43.808 --> 01:10:47.352
You know they say a solid
d wins championships.

01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:50.112
- Hey man, I
appreciate it, guys.

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.194
What we in a huddle now?

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:58.530
What we gonna do? Do we fight?
We fight.

01:10:58.554 --> 01:10:59.698
- We fight.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:00.865
- We fight.
- We fight.

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.033
- We fight.
- We fight.

01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:03.201
- We fight.
- We fight.

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:04.369
- We fight.
- We fight.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:05.537
- We fight.
- We fight.

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:06.504
- We fight.
- We fight.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.106
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:13.602
- You guys, thank
you for coming.

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:18.474
- What? They followed me.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.010
What can I say?

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:06.564
You were terminated, for praying
with one of the students

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:08.867
and that that
violated the rules.

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:13.171
Did you or did you not
pray with Kurt Rodgers?

01:12:13.195 --> 01:12:14.195
- I did.

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:18.132
- And why?

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:23.672
- I did it because I
recognized pain in his eyes.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.175
I knew it.

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.110
And

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:33.958
so then I made a choice to
help one of my players.

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:35.050
That was all.

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:44.569
- You do understand that
not everyone believes

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.371
prayer helps?

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:49.374
- I'm not concerned with
what everyone believes,

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:50.809
or what everyone thinks.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.753
I just know that I'm the
only person who's walked

01:12:52.777 --> 01:12:54.879
a mile in my own shoes,

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:55.903
and I know

01:12:57.506 --> 01:13:01.243
the hopelessness of a
life without any faith,

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:08.250
know what that can be like.

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:11.930
Everything I do, and
everything I did

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:13.498
was to

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:17.626
help my players, and help
them become better men.

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:23.298
- Your witness.

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:29.180
- You understood that prayer in
school is against the rules?

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.515
- No I didn't.

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:33.618
The constitution guarantees
my right to free speech.

01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:34.919
Period.

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:37.989
- Strain lay interpretation
be that as it may,

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:39.748
is it your claim that

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:42.050
prayer helps,

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:44.352
helps.

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:47.723
That prayer has helped you.

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.335
- Yeah.

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:52.604
- Helped you as a child?

01:13:52.628 --> 01:13:54.038
- Uh huh.

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:57.766
- Prayer's helped you as far
back as you can remember?

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:00.879
- I've been praying
all my life and

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:04.482
it has always helped me
through troubles yes.

01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:06.985
- In 1991, when you
were 10 did you...

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:08.920
- Objection, your Honor.

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:11.556
This is case is not about Mr.
Paul's character,

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.324
as a child or an adult.

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:15.560
The facts of this case
turn on whether Mr. Paul's

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:19.030
termination was a violation
of school policy and

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:21.232
I quote Mr. Herrington.

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:22.656
- He has you there Mr.
Herrington...

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.640
- Counselor's just a tad
late with that objection,

01:14:24.664 --> 01:14:28.039
Mr. Paul is the one who opened
up the door to his past,

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:32.134
on a principle that prayer
has always helped him.

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:43.644
In 1991,

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:48.617
were you arrested for murder?

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:54.494
Don't look at your counsel,
he can't answer that for you,

01:14:54.518 --> 01:14:55.962
you're up there all on your own.

01:14:55.986 --> 01:14:58.927
In 1991, were you
arrested for murder?

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:04.676
- I was.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.846
- And did pray help you then?

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:08.870
- It did.

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:12.717
- Did prayer help you when you

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:16.387
pushed a man through
a glass window?

01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:17.411
- Yeah.

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:22.827
- Did prayer help you when
you punched the man and you

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.119
broke his nose?

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:33.629
Did prayer help you when you
shot and killed the man?

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.798
Your very own father?

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:45.316
- Thank you Lord that you
will redeem my soul in peace

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.885
from the battle
that is against me.

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:47.952
- I'm sorry I can't,

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:48.853
I'm standing right
here, I can't hear it,

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:50.321
could you speak up?

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:53.057
- Thank you Lord that you
will redeem my soul in peace,

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.441
from the battle
that is against me.

01:15:54.465 --> 01:15:56.065
- Your Honor, please
instruct the witness

01:15:56.089 --> 01:15:57.996
to answer the questions before?

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:00.265
- Please, sir, answer the
counsel's questions.

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:02.624
- His questions, yeah I did.

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:05.294
It did help me then.

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:08.539
- That's the same help,
that you were giving Kurt

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:10.775
regarding his father.

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:12.534
No further questions.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:38.593
- Counsel?

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:44.433
- The plaintiff calls Nona Paul.

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.845
- What are you doing?

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:51.316
- She called, said
it's her last chance.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.884
- You should've
told me about this.

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:53.751
I don't like this at all.

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:56.020
- Just trust me.

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:39.755
- It's time.

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:42.924
It's my turn.

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:57.806
- Did Aiden shoot his father?

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.342
- No. No he didn't.

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:06.557
- Did he say he did?

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:08.893
- Objection.

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.585
- Overruled.

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:15.757
- Yes, yes he did.

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:20.896
- Ms. Paul, in your own words,

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:24.842
tell us what
happened that night.

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.701
- I was a drug addict.

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:29.538
I had two strikes.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:34.375
His father,

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:37.379
was a horrible,

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:39.948
violent man.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:46.221
He and his friends would
do terrible things to me.

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:52.561
Things a child should
never have to see.

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:57.265
Aiden was always my protector.

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:02.671
Until that night.

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:06.842
That night, his
father went after,

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:08.776
Aiden,

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:15.059
and I decided in a split
second, I would do,

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:17.085
what I knew I had to do.

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:33.635
- What did you mean by
coming after Aiden?

01:19:38.773 --> 01:19:40.675
No need to answer that.

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:56.534
- Your mother has cancer.

01:19:56.558 --> 01:20:01.172
Small cell carcinoma, it's a
very invasive type of cancer.

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:02.196
I'm sorry.

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:06.677
- Come together
they asked of him,

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:09.947
saying Lord we'll doubt
this time restore again

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:12.350
in the kingdom to Israel.

01:20:12.374 --> 01:20:14.285
And he said unto them,

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:17.188
it's not for you to know
the times or the seasons

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:20.958
which the Father hath
put in his own power,

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:22.894
but you shall receive power.

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:25.654
- Can you forgive me?

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:37.175
- I was just a little kid.

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:39.701
And you left me in the system.

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:47.876
I grew up in foster homes.

01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:51.746
You never even came to visit me.

01:20:53.748 --> 01:20:55.183
- I was a coward.

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:01.790
Simple as that.

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.897
Facing you everyday, I,

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:14.202
it was facing my failure.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:18.539
My fear.

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:23.678
You are everything I
wish I could have been.

01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:33.831
I don't deserve
your forgiveness,

01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:35.900
I don't deserve your love.

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:38.035
- Yeah you do, I
want you to have it.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:41.296
You do deserve it,
you already have it.

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:44.275
You're forgiven okay?

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:46.244
I forgive you.

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:48.846
I don't even care, I just want

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:51.106
I just want you to be here.

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:55.710
I just want you to be here.

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:02.860
- Well Mr. Brown, we
find ourselves in

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:04.328
a precarious position.

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:06.697
Here's the promise, don't have
my money by the end of the

01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:09.557
day, that email
becomes a reality.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.796
- Counsel?

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.823
Are you ready for
closing arguments?

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:24.208
- He's pointing to you.

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:27.945
- Mr. Brown is the
plaintiff ready?

01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:29.070
- Your Honor,

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:34.318
I need a recess for a day.

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:35.343
- Objection.

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:39.590
- This jury has been patient
and I will not make them

01:23:39.614 --> 01:23:40.992
wait another day.

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:43.694
- Your Honor, I have to
attend to a personal matter,

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:46.955
of extreme urgency
and I have to do it,

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.400
right now.

01:23:49.424 --> 01:23:52.203
- Your Honor if he had a matter
of such grave importance

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:55.573
he should've addressed
it before today.

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:59.110
- Mr. Brown, I find this last
minute request to be both

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:00.611
unprofessional and discourteous,

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:02.913
Mr. Herrington, are you ready
for closing arguments?

01:24:02.937 --> 01:24:05.049
- Prepared your Honor.

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:08.085
- It is time for your closing Mr.
Brown, now.

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:12.289
- With all due respect your
Honor, to you and to the jury.

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:16.151
I will not be doing my
closing argument today.

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.619
There are some things
even more important than

01:24:19.643 --> 01:24:20.978
our convenience,

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:24.368
or even the rule of law.

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:27.796
Today I'm faced with
one of those things.

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.333
Please forgive me.

01:24:33.601 --> 01:24:34.912
I'll be ready tomorrow.

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:36.080
- Mr. Brown.

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:39.183
Mr. Brown! If you step
into that gallery,

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:41.118
I'll order you arrest
and held in contempt

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.987
of court, this is my courtroom.

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:44.989
And you will be
held accountable.

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:46.624
In my court, in my book,

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:48.793
do you understand?

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:04.942
- Let me go.

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:06.744
She needs me.

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:07.768
Let me go.

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:10.904
No.

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:24.886
- There he is.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.857
Man too smart to
end up in cuffs.

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:32.236
- How do you keep
it all together?

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.260
Hm?

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:37.741
Everything falling
apart in your life and

01:25:37.765 --> 01:25:39.877
still you believe.

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:41.846
- Don't think I don't get tired.

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:44.882
Don't think I don't
ask for answers.

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:47.142
I do, but I keep the faith.

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:49.711
- I'm a gambler.

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:51.745
I gamble.

01:25:53.014 --> 01:25:56.851
You don't know what it feels
like to grow up a gambler.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.421
You feel empty,

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:02.489
unwanted.

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:07.529
The only place I've...

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:13.401
The only place I actually
felt like someone,

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:17.114
was sitting at a table.

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:19.350
- Well Michael, you know
there's one family that I know

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:22.810
that I'm always a part
of no matter what.

01:26:26.091 --> 01:26:27.091
- No matter what.

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:28.550
- No matter what.

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:46.467
- I stand here, my hands and
feet shackled like a slave.

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:50.905
My freedom is restricted.

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:52.873
Freedom.

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:57.445
Freedom is why we're here today.

01:26:58.513 --> 01:27:01.725
The defendant has shackled
my client's freedom to share

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:03.827
his faith with someone who

01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:05.687
simply asked for help.

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:10.668
And when my client responded
yes I'll help you,

01:27:10.692 --> 01:27:13.938
and decided to break
his shackles,

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:15.196
they fired him.

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:18.199
They say that

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:23.371
prayer in schools is
constitutional prohibited.

01:27:24.205 --> 01:27:27.851
I say it's constitutionally
protected.

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:32.046
Freedom of speech protects
our right to speak freely,

01:27:34.215 --> 01:27:37.695
and a plain text reading of
the amendment says no law,

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:41.889
no law shall be made to impede
free exercise of religion.

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:46.503
So they say separation
of church and state,

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:50.632
I say there would be no
state without the church.

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:54.378
But ladies and gentlemen,

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:55.470
I'm helpless,

01:27:56.938 --> 01:28:01.109
I've taken him as far as
my abilities have allowed.

01:28:02.076 --> 01:28:03.978
And now it's up to you.

01:28:05.046 --> 01:28:08.759
I'm helpless bound
in these shackles.

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:12.120
I can't break them, I
can't unlock them.

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:16.190
I can't do anything on my own.

01:28:55.763 --> 01:28:58.442
- Has the jury
reached a verdict?

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:00.234
- We have your Honor.

01:29:10.144 --> 01:29:11.144
We find

01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:18.386
for the plaintiff, Aiden Paul.

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:23.333
- And for damages?

01:29:23.357 --> 01:29:27.295
- We award the plaintiff
$700,000 reinstatement

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:32.743
with full pay and for the
defendant to pay attorney

01:29:32.767 --> 01:29:35.336
fees in the amount of $250,000.

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.892
And the jury collectively

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:51.795
wants to say that
as a community,

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:54.264
we wish more teachers

01:29:54.288 --> 01:29:57.334
would take the time to
pray with the students

01:29:57.358 --> 01:29:59.169
in our schools.

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:02.172
- Defense moves for a
directive verdict your Honor.

01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:03.607
- Denied.

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:06.276
- Request to the state of
the order pending appealed.

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.211
- Denied.

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:08.479
Coach Paul,

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:10.714
you are ordered reinstated
as of immediately.

01:30:10.738 --> 01:30:12.516
Congratulations, counselor.

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.184
But my order of
contempt still stands,

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:16.520
you still have to show more
respect for the institution

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:17.821
of the law,

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:21.492
now you may conclude your
celebration in custody.

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:22.516
Bailiff.

01:30:57.685 --> 01:30:59.096
- Five minutes older than me.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.531
- Stop it.

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:03.491
I am the baby and
I always will be.

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:15.245
- Never understood, I always
wondered how a man could

01:31:15.269 --> 01:31:18.506
survive in quarters
fit for a rat, huh?

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:23.120
Well, the reason for my visit.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.745
- You read my mind.

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:28.149
- Thomas Hill.

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.150
- Who?

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:34.264
- He sat unseen for nearly
30 years but a name who

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:37.358
who still haunts me
to this very day.

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:43.974
Third year, law school I was
an intern in the district

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:47.544
attorney's office and I
tried my first case.

01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:49.070
I was arrogant and

01:31:50.705 --> 01:31:52.039
he beat me down.

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:57.387
The walk of shame when I got
back to the office, whoa.

01:31:57.411 --> 01:32:01.582
I promise I'd never allow
myself to get beat again.

01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:05.362
When things got difficult,

01:32:05.386 --> 01:32:08.765
those two words,
they motivated me,

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:09.790
Thomas Hill.

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:15.596
Now replaced by Michael Brown,

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:19.042
the only man to have
ever beaten me,

01:32:19.066 --> 01:32:21.378
replaced by the only other
man to have ever beat me

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:23.914
who's name will drive
me to my twilight

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:26.340
to never feel this way again.

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:31.221
- Was that a long
winded congratulations?

01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:34.749
- That's what it sounded
like to me, yeah.

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.632
- Seeing that a jury's
ordered my client to pay

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:44.668
nearly one million dollars
combined with the fact that

01:32:44.692 --> 01:32:48.639
we do not wish to upset the
Supreme Court's precedent's

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:51.942
in the unlikely event that
you should win an appeal.

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:56.137
I have been authorized to
make you a one time offer.

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:09.950
- $300,000.

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:15.122
- $200,000 Mr Paul,
$100,000 to counsel.

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:22.129
- This check is dated
four days ago.

01:33:23.863 --> 01:33:25.943
- I had the authority to
issue it anytime I felt that

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:29.947
you actually had a chance
to make your case.

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:32.406
Which didn't arise until your

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:34.985
moving

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:36.009
closing.

01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:47.464
I don't want to stand
around here all day so,

01:33:47.488 --> 01:33:49.056
what's it gonna be?

01:33:51.002 --> 01:33:52.002
- My job?

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:53.928
- Court's order stands.

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:06.874
I did ask the judge
for one little favor.

01:34:12.013 --> 01:34:13.693
- You can go ahead and
roll your things up,

01:34:13.717 --> 01:34:16.887
I'll be back to get
you in 10 minutes.

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:20.130
- Still don't think there's
anything greater going

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:21.131
on in here Michael?

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:22.332
- What are you doing?

01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:24.334
- What does it look
like I'm doing, man.

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:25.602
- Here and now?

01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:27.528
- Don't you understand,

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:29.597
don't you see?
