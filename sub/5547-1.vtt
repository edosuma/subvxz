03:03.166 --> 03:08.041
The Crime Rate in the United States
Rises Four Hundred Percent.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.750
The once-great city of New York

03:15.750 --> 03:19.916
becomes the one maximum-security prison
for the entire country.

03:20.041 --> 03:24.041
A fifty-foot containment wall
is erected along the New Jersey shoreline,...

03:24.125 --> 03:28.333
across the Harlem river,
and down along the Brooklyn shoreline.

03:28.333 --> 03:32.208
It completely surrounds Manhattan Island.

03:32.333 --> 03:36.333
All bridges and waterways are mined.

03:37.708 --> 03:41.500
The United States Police Force, like an army,
is encamped around the island.

03:41.625 --> 03:44.500
There are no guards inside the prison:

03:44.625 --> 03:46.625
only prisoners and the worlds
they have made.

03:49.625 --> 03:54.500
The rules are simple.
Once you go in, you don't come out.

04:20.166 --> 04:23.458
This is Gotham 4, North Bay, Station 17.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.458
I have an escape in progress.

04:25.583 --> 04:28.375
An object in mid-bay moving toward the wall.

05:32.416 --> 05:36.208
You have 10 seconds.  Turn around.
Start back to the island.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.833
Gotham 4, confirm the kill.

06:31.833 --> 06:34.333
Circled the base.  Over.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.958
Security, this is Rehme.
We have confirmation from Gotham 4.

06:37.041 --> 06:41.125
We have a kill in midharbor. South of
the battery. Two in the water dead.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.625
Two confirmed.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.125
Very well.

06:49.625 --> 06:52.708
Air traffic, this is Rehme ...

08:15.041 --> 08:17.250
"No talking.  No smoking.
Follow the ORANGE line."

08:17.333 --> 08:20.041
Attention.  You are now entering
the debarkation area.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.041
No talking.  No
smoking.

08:22.041 --> 08:25.041
Follow the orange line
to the processes area.

08:25.041 --> 08:28.708
The next scheduled departure to
the prison is in two hours.

08:28.833 --> 08:32.707
You now have the option to terminate
and be cremated on the premises

08:32.832 --> 08:37.416
If you elect this option, notify the
duty sergeant in your processingarea.

08:43.416 --> 08:45.000
Hold on!

09:10.791 --> 09:14.000
We've got a small jet in trouble,
over restricted air space.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.666
- Where is it?
- Seven miles out and closing.

09:30.875 --> 09:35.166
We've been on the board for the last 20
minutes. We haven't been able to reach them.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.375
There was a transmission 10 minutes ago.

09:37.375 --> 09:41.250
He identified as "David 14."
Then all of a sudden he was cut off.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.666
David 14, acknowledge.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.541
David 14, we are sending Air Rescue.

09:46.666 --> 09:48.958
Squawk 7700,

09:49.041 --> 09:52.458
contact on 121.5.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.458
There's still no reply.

09:55.541 --> 10:00.041
Bayonne.  I have a mayday in restricted space.

10:00.125 --> 10:02.833
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

10:02.916 --> 10:05.916
- You have the code?
- There's no David 14 on the computer.

10:05.916 --> 10:07.541
- Unlisted?
- Unregistered code.

10:07.625 --> 10:10.416
We telexed Washington.
Still waiting for a reply.

10:10.541 --> 10:12.625
I think I've got him, sir.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.916
It's too late, assholes.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.416
All your imperialist weapons and lies
can't save him now.

10:22.500 --> 10:26.208
We're going down. We're going to crash.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.708
David 14, acknowledge!

10:28.791 --> 10:30.791
The code's coming in, sir.

10:34.791 --> 10:37.083
"Aircraft Identified.

10:37.208 --> 10:39.875
Code: David14.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.291
Decode: AIR FORCE ONE."

10:54.000 --> 10:58.666
Tell this to the workers when
they ask where your leader went ...

10:58.791 --> 11:03.791
We, the soldiers of the national
liberation front of America,

11:03.875 --> 11:06.250
in the name of the workers

11:06.375 --> 11:10.083
and all the oppressed of
this imperialist country

11:10.166 --> 11:14.666
have struck a fatal blow to
the racist police stick!

11:14.750 --> 11:18.958
What better revolutionary example
than to let the president perish

11:18.958 --> 11:22.958
in the inhuman dungeon of
his own imperialist prison?

11:24.833 --> 11:29.125
Unlock the pod!
She's bolted the door.

11:29.125 --> 11:32.250
- Can't you shoot off the lock?
- No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.541
How about lifting the door off of the hinges?

11:34.625 --> 11:35.541
No, sir.

11:40.125 --> 11:41.750
Get me to the pod.

11:53.625 --> 11:57.416
Sir, this is a locating device to trace you
if you become separated from the pod.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.833
I'm activating it now.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.708
God save me and watch over you all.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.083
Computer simulation tracking Air Force One.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.791
The plane goes down.

12:31.875 --> 12:34.083
It's the escape pod.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.791
40 degrees,

12:41.375 --> 12:43.458
50 yards from impact.

12:44.458 --> 12:47.250
I'm going in.

13:30.125 --> 13:33.916
1-W-Larry.  Over the battery.

13:35.416 --> 13:37.916
We're moving down.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.916
Direct sight ahead.

15:47.875 --> 15:50.291
You touch me... he dies.

15:50.291 --> 15:53.000
If you're not in the air
in thirty seconds...he dies.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.791
You come back in... he dies.

16:00.458 --> 16:04.375
- Twenty seconds.
- I'm ready to talk.

16:04.458 --> 16:07.666
19...18...

16:07.750 --> 16:11.666
- What do you want?
- 17...16...

16:11.666 --> 16:13.541
Let's go.  Let's go!

16:42.125 --> 16:45.625
Yes, he's right here,
Mr. Vice President.

16:47.916 --> 16:50.041
This is Bob Hauk.

16:51.541 --> 16:54.416
We can't.  If we move in with choppers,
they'll kill him.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.708
We're lucky if he's not dead already...

16:57.833 --> 17:01.625
They don't want anything yet. By the time they
figure out what they want,it'll be too late.

17:01.625 --> 17:04.708
Tell him we have to go with your plan now.

17:04.708 --> 17:08.500
We can't wait until tomorrow. If we have to move
in and take the island, it's a last resort.

17:08.625 --> 17:13.083
It's 8:45. I want permission to try a
rescue.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.415
Thank you.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.875
All right.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.208
- He's dangerous sir.
- I know. I'll be ok.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.750
I'm not a fool, Plissken.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.958
Call me Snake.

17:55.250 --> 17:58.875
S.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.

17:58.958 --> 18:01.833
Special Forces Unit, Black Flight.

18:01.958 --> 18:04.041
Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.833
.  Youngest man to be decorated
by the President.

18:07.958 --> 18:10.750
You robbed the federal reserve depository.

18:10.833 --> 18:14.041
Life sentence, New York
Maximum Security Penitentiary.

18:14.125 --> 18:17.833
I'm ready to kick your
ass out of the world, War Hero.

18:32.708 --> 18:34.708
- Who are you?
- Hauk

18:35.916 --> 18:38.208
Police Commissioner.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.416
Bob Hauk.

18:40.500 --> 18:44.916
Special Forces Unit.  Texas Thunder.
We heard of you, too, Plissken.

18:44.916 --> 18:48.791
- Why are we talking?
- I have a deal for you.

18:50.500 --> 18:54.083
You'll receive full pardon for every criminal
act committed in the United States.

18:55.291 --> 19:00.000
There was an accident about an hour ago.
A small jet went down inside New York City.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.583
The President was on board.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.583
President of what?

19:04.708 --> 19:07.291
That's not funny, Plissken.

19:07.291 --> 19:10.875
You go in, find the President and
bring him out in 24 hours,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.500
- and you're a free man.
- 24 hours, huh?

19:13.583 --> 19:15.791
- I'm making you an offer.
- Bullshit.

19:15.875 --> 19:18.291
- Straight just like I said.
- I'll think about it.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.375
No time.  Give me an answer.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.458
Get a new president.

19:22.583 --> 19:25.875
We're still at war, Plissken.
We need him alive.

19:25.875 --> 19:30.250
I don't give a fuck about your war...
or your president.

19:31.666 --> 19:33.875
- Is that your answer?
- I'm thinking about it.

19:33.958 --> 19:35.375
Think hard.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.541
Why me?

19:44.541 --> 19:46.958
You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.

19:47.041 --> 19:49.833
You know how to get in quiet.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.958
You're all I've got.

19:54.958 --> 19:57.541
I guess I go in one way or the other.
Doesn't mean shit to me. Give me the paper.

19:57.541 --> 20:00.250
- When you come out.
- Before.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.125
I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.333
Call me Snake.

20:06.833 --> 20:11.916
Some of them have cars. They took old junkers
that were left behind and converted them to steam.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.500
We think they may also have a gasoline source
in there, and power.

20:14.625 --> 20:18.916
Greenhouses, rigged up generators.
Some areas have streetlights.

20:18.916 --> 20:20.625
The crazies.

20:20.708 --> 20:24.625
Live in the subways.  Complete control
of the underground.

20:24.625 --> 20:26.208
They're night raiders.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.583
Tracer.  Sends a radio signal
for fifteen minutes.

20:30.583 --> 20:34.291
You push it, we can track you on radar.
Just like Leningrad.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.000
But they added something.  A
safety catch.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.375
Where am I landing?

20:49.375 --> 20:52.291
Top of the world trade center.
Only place you can land.

20:52.291 --> 20:55.375
They won't see it, and you can t
ake off from a free fall.

20:55.375 --> 20:58.166
On the roof there's a
service elevator.

20:58.291 --> 21:02.375
It's still operational.
We use it to infiltrate the prison.

21:02.375 --> 21:06.166
There's a power box.
It'll activate the elevator down to fifty.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.750
From there on down you walk.

21:08.750 --> 21:12.041
You can locate the President by
his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist.

21:12.166 --> 21:15.250
It sends out a sig pulse.  Use this.

21:15.375 --> 21:19.166
Homing device.
Shows directions and distance.

21:22.166 --> 21:26.750
Strong antitoxin. Stops bacteria
and viral-proofs you for 24 hours.

21:33.958 --> 21:36.625
- Take off the jacket.
- I'll be OK.

21:36.625 --> 21:38.125
Let's go, Plissken.

21:41.750 --> 21:44.041
I don't like needles.

21:50.541 --> 21:53.625
22 hours, 29 minutes,
57 seconds...

21:53.625 --> 21:56.125
We talked about twenty-four.

21:56.125 --> 21:59.500
In 22 hours the Hartford Summit
meeting will be over.

21:59.625 --> 22:02.208
China and the Soviet Union
will go back home.

22:02.208 --> 22:06.500
The president was on his way to the
summit when his plane went down.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.708
He has a briefcase attached to his wrist.

22:08.708 --> 22:13.500
The tape recording inside has
to reach Hartford in 22 hours.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.291
What's on it?

22:15.416 --> 22:17.416
You know anything about nuclear fusion?

22:17.500 --> 22:19.291
All right.

22:19.375 --> 22:21.708
It's about the survival of
the human race, Plissken.

22:21.791 --> 22:24.708
Something you don't give a shit about.

22:29.500 --> 22:33.000
I'm going to inject you.
It'll sting for a second or two...

22:45.666 --> 22:47.083
That's it, Plissken.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.750
Tell him.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.958
Tell me what?

22:57.041 --> 22:59.375
That idea you had about turning
the Gullfire around 180 degrees

22:59.458 --> 23:03.541
and flying off to Canada.

23:03.541 --> 23:06.333
What did you do to me, asshole?

23:06.458 --> 23:09.750
My idea, Plissken.

23:09.833 --> 23:12.833
Something we've been fooling around with. Two
microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.

23:12.958 --> 23:15.541
They're already starting
to dissolve.

23:15.541 --> 23:18.333
In twenty-two hours, the cores
will completely dissolve.

23:18.416 --> 23:22.041
Inside the cores are
that heat-sensitive charge.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.125
Not a large explosive.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.833
About the size of a pinhead.

23:26.833 --> 23:30.208
big enough to --
open up both your arteries.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.416
I'd say you'd be dead
in 10 or 15 seconds --

23:32.416 --> 23:36.000
- TAKE THEM OUT NOW.
- They're protected by the cores.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.500
minutes before the last hour is
up we can neutralize the charge with X-rays.

23:48.708 --> 23:51.583
We'll burn out the charges IF
you have the President.

23:51.583 --> 23:53.208
What if I'm a little late?

23:53.291 --> 23:57.208
No more Hartford Summit.
And no more Snake Plissken.

24:00.291 --> 24:02.583
When I get back I'm going to kill you.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.791
The Gullfire's waiting.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.125
I'm ready.

24:58.125 --> 24:59.916
21 hours.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.833
Suppose he's dead, Hauk.

25:02.916 --> 25:05.416
If I come back without him,
you'll burn these things out?

25:05.416 --> 25:07.708
Get them both back, Plissken.

25:07.833 --> 25:11.333
Remember, once inside you're on your own

25:11.416 --> 25:13.916
- Oh, you mean I can't count on you?
- No.

25:13.916 --> 25:15.416
Good.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.291
"Master Life Clock"

25:41.791 --> 25:44.583
20:17:43... 42... 41....

25:44.708 --> 25:46.500
30 seconds.

26:03.958 --> 26:05.666
Are you picking up the target blip?

26:08.750 --> 26:10.583
Right on course.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.250
It's been a while ...

26:42.125 --> 26:43.625
How's your altitude?

26:46.041 --> 26:48.041
Plissken?

26:48.125 --> 26:51.541
Plissken?
Plissken, what are you doing?

26:51.625 --> 26:54.125
Playing with myself.  I'm going in.

27:45.375 --> 27:46.750
Plissken? Plissken?

28:45.125 --> 28:48.916
I'm inside the World Trade Center
on the 50th floor.

28:48.916 --> 28:52.291
- Just like Leningrad, Hauk.
- Is the glider intact?

28:52.291 --> 28:56.916
Yeah, but taking off is for shit.
I'll work it out.

28:56.916 --> 29:01.291
You'll have to use the east stairwell.
It'll take you a little while to
get to ground level.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.708
Call me when you get outside.

31:03.666 --> 31:06.375
I'm at the plane.

31:06.375 --> 31:08.875
Nobody else made it, Hauk.

31:08.875 --> 31:11.166
Wait a minute.

31:14.458 --> 31:16.750
I've got his pulse.

31:18.166 --> 31:21.166
Right up ahead, moving northwest.

34:06.166 --> 34:10.375
Hey!  You're Snake Plissken, ain't you?

34:12.000 --> 34:15.166
- What do you want?
- Nothin'.

34:16.166 --> 34:18.458
I thought you were dead!

34:21.166 --> 34:25.458
Hey!  You don't want to
walk around down there, Snake!

35:22.500 --> 35:25.000
Hi, Chief.  Nice night.

35:27.625 --> 35:31.000
Nice boots.  Niiiiice boots.  Hey.

35:38.083 --> 35:40.375
Easy now, chief.

35:40.375 --> 35:42.000
I'm walking.  I'm walking.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.875
Mr. President ...

36:13.250 --> 36:16.666
I'm the President?
Sure, I'm the President.

36:16.750 --> 36:20.666
If I knew where I got this thing --
I'd be the President.

36:25.458 --> 36:30.958
- Where did you get it?
- I woke up, and there it was,
just like a miracle ...

36:31.041 --> 36:35.958
The President's life signs all fail.

36:36.041 --> 36:38.250
Oh my god ...

36:38.333 --> 36:42.750
It ... It may be just an impact
on the mechanism itself ...

36:44.250 --> 36:45.625
Hauk?

36:45.708 --> 36:47.708
I'm right here, Plissken.

36:47.708 --> 36:52.208
I don't know who you assholes are
looking at, but it's NOT the President.

36:53.333 --> 36:55.916
Hail to the chief... La la la la la la...

36:58.333 --> 37:00.500
All right, get your machine ready.
I'm coming out.

37:00.625 --> 37:02.708
18 hours, Plissken.

37:02.791 --> 37:08.416
Listen to me, Hauk. The President is DEAD,
you got that? Somebody's had him for dinner!

37:08.500 --> 37:11.708
Plissken, if you get back in that
glider I'll shoot you down.

37:11.791 --> 37:14.083
You climb out, I'll burn you off the wall.

37:14.083 --> 37:16.916
You understand that, Plissken?

37:20.791 --> 37:23.083
A little human compassion ...

40:38.500 --> 40:40.875
- You a cop?
- No.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.708
You've got a gun.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.875
You got a smoke?

40:58.666 --> 41:00.958
Keep your hand over it.

41:01.083 --> 41:03.875
It's all right if we're quiet.
They won't hear us.

41:05.458 --> 41:07.750
Hey, this is a real one.  You just get in?

41:07.875 --> 41:10.375
What's going on out there?

41:10.375 --> 41:12.250
Crazies.

41:12.375 --> 41:15.250
It's the end of the month.  They're out of food.

41:16.458 --> 41:18.875
Do you live here?

41:18.958 --> 41:23.166
Skulls?  You kidding?
I'm with the Turks now.

41:23.166 --> 41:25.541
I just got caught in the street after
dark and now I'm stuck here all night.

41:25.666 --> 41:29.041
- A plane crashed seven hours ago.  Did you see it?
- No.

41:32.458 --> 41:34.625
Shit.

41:36.625 --> 41:39.416
- You're a cop.
- I'm an asshole.

41:43.041 --> 41:45.208
Hey, wait a minute.

41:45.333 --> 41:47.833
I know who you are.

41:47.916 --> 41:50.208
Yeah!  But I heard you were
dead.

41:50.333 --> 41:51.708
I am.

41:52.708 --> 41:57.416
Wow, Snake Plissken.  All right!
What you doing in here with a gun, Snake?

41:57.416 --> 41:59.416
Looking for somebody.

41:59.416 --> 42:01.125
- Who?
- The President.

42:02.208 --> 42:05.625
Come on!  He really here?

42:05.625 --> 42:07.625
Somewhere.

42:10.916 --> 42:13.791
When you find him,

42:13.916 --> 42:16.083
are you gonna take him out?

42:18.875 --> 42:21.791
Take me out with you, Snake.

42:21.791 --> 42:23.291
Why?

42:24.375 --> 42:27.375
I can think of lots of reasons why ...

44:27.875 --> 44:29.750
Where you goin', buddy?

44:39.041 --> 44:43.166
Bad neighborhood! You don't want to be
walking from the Bowery to 42nd street at night!

44:43.250 --> 44:47.833
I've been driving a cab here for 30 years
and you don't walk around here at night!

44:47.958 --> 44:49.541
Yes, sir!

44:49.625 --> 44:52.958
They'll kill you and strip
you in ten seconds flat.

44:52.958 --> 44:57.416
Usually I'm not down around here myself,
but I wanted to catch that show.

44:57.416 --> 44:59.625
This stuff is like gold around here, you know.

45:07.416 --> 45:12.041
Hey, Snake, when'd you get in?
I didn't even know they caught you.

45:12.125 --> 45:16.125
Ohhh, Snake Plissken in my cab.

45:16.208 --> 45:18.125
Wait'll I tell Eddie!

45:18.208 --> 45:19.625
Hey, hang on, Snake.

45:28.708 --> 45:33.208
- Hey, what were you doing back there, Snake?
- Looking for somebody.

45:33.208 --> 45:37.208
Well, why didn't you ask me?
Hell, I know everybody in this town.

45:37.208 --> 45:41.208
I've been driving this cab for
thirty years, this very same cab.

45:41.291 --> 45:43.875
I'm GONNA ask you.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.791
Now where's the President?

45:45.875 --> 45:49.375
The Duke's got him!
Everyone knows the Duke's got him!

45:49.500 --> 45:51.666
You don't have to put a gun to my head.
I'll tell you!

45:51.791 --> 45:53.958
- Who's the Duke?
- The DUKE!

45:53.958 --> 45:58.583
The Duke of New York!  A-Number-1!
The big man, that's who!

46:01.666 --> 46:03.458
I want to meet this Duke.

46:03.583 --> 46:07.875
You can't meet the Duke, are you crazy?
Nobody wants to meet the Duke!

46:07.875 --> 46:10.958
You meet him once and then you're dead!

46:35.625 --> 46:38.333
I hate to leave her on the street.

46:39.541 --> 46:42.833
Usually I don't leave her alone at all.

46:45.333 --> 46:48.041
But you're a special case, Snake.

47:14.208 --> 47:18.208
It's OK, Snake.  It's a better neighborhood.
You can relax.

47:21.083 --> 47:23.291
Thanks.

47:23.375 --> 47:26.375
Boy, they got a great place here.
Like a fortress!

47:26.500 --> 47:28.291
They?

47:28.291 --> 47:30.791
- Who is it?
- It's me!

47:30.875 --> 47:33.875
- Who's me?
- Cabbie!

47:33.958 --> 47:36.166
What do you want?

47:36.291 --> 47:38.458
Somebody wants to see Brain, it's important --

47:38.458 --> 47:40.583
- No way, Cabbie --
- No, it's Snake!  Snake Plissken!

47:40.666 --> 47:42.875
Snake Plissken.

47:53.541 --> 47:55.166
YOU'RE Plissken?

47:55.250 --> 47:57.375
He wants to see Brain.

47:58.458 --> 47:59.833
Why?

48:07.833 --> 48:09.958
I want to meet the Duke.

48:28.208 --> 48:32.125
Hey, what do you think of this place, Snake?
It used to be a public library.

48:32.208 --> 48:34.625
Oh, that Brain, he's the greatest!

48:34.625 --> 48:36.125
Mr. Fabulous!

48:36.125 --> 48:38.208
Duke loves him.

48:39.208 --> 48:43.791
- Who is that?
- That's Maggie.  Brain's squeeze.

48:43.791 --> 48:47.291
Duke gave him to Brain just to
keep him happy ...

48:47.416 --> 48:49.416
...see what I mean?

48:51.916 --> 48:53.916
Heard you were dead.

49:01.083 --> 49:05.500
Brain?  Brain!
I brought somebody to see you!

49:08.083 --> 49:10.500
Harold Hellman.

49:13.583 --> 49:14.666
Snake?

49:14.791 --> 49:16.083
Harold?

49:16.083 --> 49:20.291
Where you been, Harold?
It's been a long time.

49:20.375 --> 49:22.750
You never told me you
knew Snake Plissken, Brain.

49:22.875 --> 49:27.666
Isn't that great?  Hey, Brain, I could use
some gas if you can spare some ...

49:30.458 --> 49:32.458
I'm glad you remember me.

49:32.541 --> 49:37.375
Yeah.  A man should remember his past.

49:37.375 --> 49:40.333
Kansas City, four years ago.
You ran out on me.

49:41.458 --> 49:44.458
- You left me sitting there.
- You were late.

49:44.458 --> 49:47.333
We were buddies, Harold.

49:47.333 --> 49:51.541
You, me, and Fresno Bob.
You know what they did to Bob?

49:55.416 --> 49:58.750
You want to see him sprayed all over
that map, baby? Where's the President?!

49:58.833 --> 50:01.750
- Swear to god, Snake, I don't know --
- Don't fuck with me!

50:03.708 --> 50:06.041
- Why do you want to know?
- I want him.

50:06.916 --> 50:10.625
- Working for the man now, huh?
- Then I'll just beat it out of your squeeze --

50:10.708 --> 50:12.708
Mm-hm.  Maggie doesn't know EXACTLY where he is

50:12.833 --> 50:16.500
and unless you know EXACTLY PRECISELY w
here he is you'll never find him.

50:25.125 --> 50:27.000
Listen, I'll take you out of here.

50:27.125 --> 50:32.708
Yeah.  Jet glider just a couple of
blocks down the street.

50:33.708 --> 50:36.291
And all you gotta do is get me to him.

50:36.291 --> 50:39.083
No kidding?  On the level?

50:39.208 --> 50:41.583
Will you take me, too?

50:42.583 --> 50:46.000
- We've got to deal somewhere else.
- No glider.

50:46.083 --> 50:50.291
We've got the President.  And the Duke's
taking everybody out of here.

50:50.375 --> 50:53.291
Never happen.

50:53.375 --> 50:57.375
See, I know something
you and the Duke don't know.

50:57.458 --> 51:00.958
.  We've
only got so long before Mr. President
don't mean a whole lot.

51:01.083 --> 51:04.750
- You're lying.
- Maybe he's not ...

51:06.583 --> 51:09.083
I know him!  Look at his face, he's lying!

51:09.166 --> 51:11.541
Right, Harold.  I'm lying.

51:12.541 --> 51:17.250
So I might as well have some fun
and keep looking by myself.

51:17.375 --> 51:20.041
Brain, he'll kill us both if you don't tell him --
Brain, you've got to tell him --

51:20.166 --> 51:22.750
ALL RIGHT!!!

51:25.458 --> 51:28.125
You always were smart, Harold.

51:28.250 --> 51:31.250
Just one thing right now.

51:31.333 --> 51:33.750
Don't call me "Harold."

51:37.833 --> 51:41.416
So you work for this Duke, huh?

51:41.416 --> 51:43.041
Yeah.

51:43.041 --> 51:47.333
Make gas for him.
Figure out things for him.

51:47.333 --> 51:49.333
Like what?

51:49.416 --> 51:51.541
Like how to get across
the 69th street bridge --

51:51.541 --> 51:54.000
it's mined, but I know
where they're planted.

51:54.125 --> 51:57.708
We got a diagram from a guy
that got all the way across ...

51:57.833 --> 52:00.000
... beforethey shot the poor bastard.

52:00.125 --> 52:02.625
We got a crew up there now clearing
the way across the first barricade.

52:02.708 --> 52:04.625
What a sight, Snake!

52:04.708 --> 52:09.291
The whole camp rolling right across
the bridge and the President right out front!

52:09.416 --> 52:12.000
Oh, that would have been so fine ...

52:12.083 --> 52:14.291
Yeah, it would have been ...

52:14.416 --> 52:16.500
Yeah, but we're going with Snake now.

52:18.708 --> 52:22.375
That's the Duke!  I know the
sound of his engines.

52:24.708 --> 52:27.083
Don't cross the Duke

52:27.166 --> 52:28.583
-- everybody knows that.

52:36.875 --> 52:38.791
-- everybody knows that.

52:44.875 --> 52:46.375
No, Brain!

53:54.708 --> 53:57.291
- He's looking for you, Brain
- What does he want?

53:57.375 --> 53:59.375
He wants my diagram of the bridge.

53:59.500 --> 54:02.875
When he finds out I'm with you he's going to want
my life! I knew I shouldn't have listened to you --

54:02.875 --> 54:05.375
We've got to get to the President NOW,
while he's busy.

54:05.500 --> 54:08.791
Forget it, he's on the other side of town
and we got no wheels. The deal is off --

54:08.791 --> 54:10.791
Just calm down.

55:13.833 --> 55:15.916
I think they saw us!
Turn left, turn left here!

55:24.916 --> 55:26.708
Brain. This is Broadway.

55:26.708 --> 55:31.000
- I know, I know, the Duke'll take
Seventh Avenue, Broadway is 5 minutes. - No!

55:31.083 --> 55:32.916
Yes!!! Just keep driving!

55:33.000 --> 55:35.083
What's wrong with Broadway?

55:44.500 --> 55:46.875
Come on sweetheart...

55:55.791 --> 55:57.458
Maggie!

56:58.625 --> 57:00.125
Hold on.

57:32.791 --> 57:35.958
He'll be in the third car from
the end, by the last campfire.

57:44.166 --> 57:48.166
It's all right. He's got to go in the front way.
It'll take him 5 minutes.

57:48.250 --> 57:50.750
If you're not back to the car
in four minutes you're on your own.

57:50.875 --> 57:54.250
When we get there,
Harold, you just keep talking.

58:29.041 --> 58:30.416
Hi, guys.

58:38.125 --> 58:41.208
Hi ... how's it going?
Cooled off a little, huh?

58:42.125 --> 58:43.625
What do you want, Brain?

58:43.625 --> 58:46.291
Duke told us to wait inside.
He's on his way here now.

58:46.416 --> 58:48.291
He didn't say nothing to us about it.

58:48.416 --> 58:51.791
Well, you can't expect him to tell everybody
in the joint, now can you? That's why he's the Duke.

58:52.583 --> 58:55.083
Why don't we wait outside here for him?

58:55.083 --> 58:57.375
Why don't we wait inside for him?

58:57.500 --> 58:59.375
'Cause I got orders, that's why.

58:59.500 --> 59:01.583
What are your specific orders, by the way?

59:01.583 --> 59:07.375
Specific orders, Brain, was for
me not to let no one go inside.

59:08.500 --> 59:10.500
How's the President holding up, by the way?

59:10.500 --> 59:13.291
Any political discussion
you've had with him?

59:14.583 --> 59:17.958
That Brain is a real pain in the ass.

59:17.958 --> 59:21.083
He's always sniffing around like a dog.

59:21.166 --> 59:23.083
He comes up with the gas.

59:27.958 --> 59:30.250
What are you looking at?

59:44.333 --> 59:46.333
Are you from the outside?

59:46.458 --> 59:49.250
- Stop shaking.
- I can't! Who are you?

59:49.333 --> 59:52.333
- Hauk sent me.  We've got to move fast
- Move fast?

59:52.333 --> 59:54.541
- You're goddamned right I'll move fast.
- Quiet!

01:00:44.666 --> 01:00:47.500
They got him.  Now watch him.

01:01:00.291 --> 01:01:03.166
Friend of yours, Brain?

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:06.166
He had a gun on me, Duke,
there was nothing I could do.

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:33.833
Who are you?

01:01:42.416 --> 01:01:44.708
I said who are you?

01:01:45.625 --> 01:01:48.625
Snake Plissken, Duke.
he Man sent him in here.

01:01:48.708 --> 01:01:50.625
Something's going down
... we need him.

01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:07.708
Snaaaaaake Plissken.

01:02:11.791 --> 01:02:14.208
I've heard of you.

01:02:26.083 --> 01:02:28.583
I heard you were dead.

01:02:51.958 --> 01:02:54.750
This is surveillance 4 to security control.

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:56.958
Nothing on the infrared body scan.

01:02:56.958 --> 01:03:01.166
There aren't any fires on the street.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:02.833
Nobody moving down here.

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:06.125
Surveillance 5 ... security control ...

01:03:06.125 --> 01:03:10.333
negative on infrared body
scan ... no movement in the searchlight ...

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:13.625
nothing strange going on down there.

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:25.625
- We've got to go in now.
- We hold.

01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:28.708
- You're countermanding my orders, Hauk.
- This is my prison, I'll give the orders.

01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:30.833
I override all that!

01:03:30.916 --> 01:03:32.333
Just try.

01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:40.625
...still negative on the scan.

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:43.708
This is Surveillance 4
to Security Control.

01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:47.416
Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Negative on the sweep.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:51.208
Surveillance 10.
Still negative on the scan.

01:03:51.291 --> 01:03:54.416
Surveillance 5 still negative.

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.291
This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.
Nothing on the infrared body scan. Negative...

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:04.708
Don't move, Snake.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.708
I want that diagram, Brain.

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:27.791
Oh. It's at my place, Duke.

01:05:27.916 --> 01:05:32.416
Duke, that Plissken said
something about a time limit.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.500
- What time limit
- On him.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.583
That's a lot of crap.

01:05:36.708 --> 01:05:39.000
What did I teach you?

01:05:40.583 --> 01:05:44.666
You... You are...
the Duke of New... New York...

01:05:44.791 --> 01:05:46.791
You're... A-Number-One.

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:48.375
I can't hear you.

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:55.958
YOU ARE... THE DUKE OF NEW YORK...
YOU'RE A-NUMBER-ONE!

01:05:57.666 --> 01:06:00.375
Get me the diagram.

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:04.583
Duke... Don't kill Plissken.
We need him.

01:06:07.666 --> 01:06:09.875
Get moving, Brain.

01:07:35.166 --> 01:07:38.291
People out below in the park.
Can you see them?

01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:42.750
Surveillance 2 to Security Control.

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:45.083
We're getting that readout,
mostly in the infrared.

01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:47.166
We have a visual sighting on it.

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:50.750
It's a crowd of prisoners in Central Park.

01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:54.666
They're waving at us.
Signaling us in the food drop area.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.666
They're waving us down.

01:08:43.416 --> 01:08:47.125
I still can't figure out whether that son
of a bitch Plissken was telling the truth or not.

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:49.207
God, I hate that guy.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.916
He got in somehow.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.207
Yeah, yeah, but how?

01:08:56.207 --> 01:08:59.791
You gotta land the glider and take off. You can't
do it in Central Park, there's too many trees.

01:08:59.791 --> 01:09:02.207
Port Authority's too low to the ground.

01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:06.166
Unless it was some......
Someplace high up.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.291
World Trade Center.  That's it.

01:09:10.375 --> 01:09:11.875
There we go. The
World Trade Center.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.457
And it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier
for me to take off than it was for him to land.

01:09:19.457 --> 01:09:24.082
"Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City
in exchange for President.

01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:26.666
69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.666
No bullshit or he's dead."

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:31.750
- Where's the tape?
- Not here.

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:37.832
They're Plissken's.

01:09:37.832 --> 01:09:40.541
So much for your man, Hauk?

01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:45.250
Warm up the choppers.
We're moving in.

01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:00.541
Plissken?

01:10:07.541 --> 01:10:09.916
Come on, get up!

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:45.250
They sent in their best man.

01:12:45.375 --> 01:12:48.166
And when we roll down the 69th
street bridge tomorrow

01:12:48.166 --> 01:12:51.375
on our way to freedom,...

01:12:51.375 --> 01:12:56.541
we're gonna have their best man
leading the way.  From the neck up.

01:13:09.041 --> 01:13:12.125
On the hood of my car!

01:13:17.333 --> 01:13:20.125
On the hood of my car!

01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:03.708
Hello.
Where'd you get the hat?

01:14:03.708 --> 01:14:05.875
- Got it from Cabbie.
- Yeah?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.583
- Traded him.
- For what?

01:14:08.583 --> 01:14:11.583
- What are you so nervous about?
- I'm here to see the President.

01:14:11.666 --> 01:14:13.666
- Who says?
- The Duke.

01:14:13.791 --> 01:14:17.166
- No he doesn't.
- Well... I'll have to
tell him you said that.

01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:19.791
Wait a minute.  Why?

01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:22.250
He's got something hidden
in his clothing.  The Duke wants it.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:24.250
- What?
- I'll show you.

01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:26.875
- You'll tell me.
- Cyanide capsules.

01:14:26.958 --> 01:14:29.875
The Duke don't want a dead president.

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:32.750
Gentlemen.

01:14:34.666 --> 01:14:36.041
Mr. President.

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:51.250
Cyanide?

01:14:51.333 --> 01:14:54.416
Yeah. He might try to take it tomorrow.

01:14:54.541 --> 01:14:56.250
That's bullshit.

01:14:58.041 --> 01:15:00.750
You're not supposed to be in here, Brain --

01:16:58.208 --> 01:17:02.500
Snake! Snake!

01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:14.916
"Tracer Status: ACTIVATED."

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.375
Tracer activated at one hour,
thirty-five minutes, twenty-seven seconds.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.875
Hauk!

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:51.875
LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:57.250
THE PRESIDENT'S GONE!

01:17:57.333 --> 01:17:59.958
BRAIN TOOK HIM!

01:18:19.916 --> 01:18:22.916
Hauk! Plissken's tracer!

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:28.833
Get on the radio!  Keep them down!
Nobody move!

01:18:30.708 --> 01:18:33.333
He's approaching the World Trade Center.

01:18:33.416 --> 01:18:35.916
I knew that son of a bitch was alive.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.416
He's inside.

01:18:57.875 --> 01:18:59.208
It's gone.

01:18:59.291 --> 01:19:01.583
The signal only lasts for 15 minutes.

01:19:01.708 --> 01:19:04.166
Download the choppers.
We're in a standby situation.

01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:07.000
Anybody could have pushed that button.

01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:10.083
Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch.

01:19:10.166 --> 01:19:13.166
Now we'll give him a little more time,
just to make sure.

01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:35.250
Goddamned redskins!

01:19:35.375 --> 01:19:37.666
They're savages, Mr. President!

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:58.916
- Listen, I swear to god, I thought you were dead --
- Yeah, you and everybody else.

01:19:58.916 --> 01:20:03.416
That's your car in the lobby?
The keys!  Quick!  Quick!

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.708
Diagram of the bridge!
Hey, hey, hey --

01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:12.208
- I'm the only one who knows how to read that --
- Stay out of my way, Harold

01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:14.916
Besides, you can't read and
drive at the same time.  You need us!

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.625
You shouldn't have double-crossed me again,
Brain. Come on, let's go --

01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:21.791
- They sawed it off...
- The tape? - Gone... I don't know where...

01:20:21.916 --> 01:20:23.416
I do.

01:20:25.625 --> 01:20:30.708
Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is. Just
take us to the car and I'll take you right to it.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.458
Don't talk.

01:20:52.458 --> 01:20:54.083
Breathe.

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:56.458
Come on, come on, we're wasting time!

01:20:56.583 --> 01:20:59.958
- What's wrong?
- Dead, Harold.
- What?!

01:21:01.875 --> 01:21:03.250
Here, take these.

01:21:07.375 --> 01:21:08.750
Car trouble?

01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.750
Hi, Duke.

01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:33.416
This whole deal of yours is over, Snake.

01:21:33.416 --> 01:21:35.750
You and Brain just say good-bye
to each other.

01:22:08.083 --> 01:22:09.500
GO, GO!

01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:22.208
They're behind us --

01:22:23.166 --> 01:22:27.083
- They come in groups of threes!
- Where's the tape, Brain?

01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:30.583
- The tape from the briefcase!
- Oh, that tape! Here it is!

01:22:30.666 --> 01:22:33.875
- You traded away your hat for it!
- How'd you know?

01:22:33.958 --> 01:22:35.375
See, see!

01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:47.666
- Here, give me that tape!
- Not just yet.

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:18.625
- Easy... easy!
- Go for it, Snake!

01:24:18.875 --> 01:24:20.583
You've got to slow down a little, Snake...

01:24:20.666 --> 01:24:23.750
- I think there are three mines ahead, Snake.
- You think?!

01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:37.250
Stay left, stay left, stay left,
and then jog right when I tell you.

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:39.666
You're pushing her too hard, Snake.

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:41.166
OK, OK, NOW!

01:25:14.208 --> 01:25:17.625
I said JOG RIGHT!...
you asshole.

01:25:32.291 --> 01:25:35.500
Stay to the right, stay to
the right, now jog left.

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.083
Hold it, left...left...

01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:40.875
LEFT, DAMMIT!

01:26:02.083 --> 01:26:03.583
Keep moving...

01:26:17.833 --> 01:26:20.250
Maggie... he's dead.

01:26:20.333 --> 01:26:21.750
Come on.

01:27:31.666 --> 01:27:35.166
Station 19!  They spotted two cars
on the 69th street bridge.

01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:37.166
- Station 19!  They spotted two cars on the
69th street bridge. - Taxicab and a Cadillac.

01:27:37.291 --> 01:27:39.166
Taxi hit a mine.
There's four people on foot.

01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:42.250
- Fourteen minutes...
- Get a jeep with a winch over there fast.

01:27:42.375 --> 01:27:46.875
Strombaerden!  Get over to Station 19.
They're coming across the bridge.

01:27:54.375 --> 01:27:57.166
This is Rehme, Security Control.

01:27:57.166 --> 01:28:01.458
We are in a standby situation.
Repeat.  We are in a standby situation.

01:28:01.541 --> 01:28:05.541
All helicopters, down.  Wall
guard, do not fire on prisoners.

01:28:05.541 --> 01:28:08.958
Repeat, do not fire on prisoners.

01:28:08.958 --> 01:28:11.250
All vehicles, stand by.

01:28:11.333 --> 01:28:13.250
Repeat, all vehicles, stand by.

01:29:42.333 --> 01:29:46.333
Yeah, hey, Number One!

01:29:46.458 --> 01:29:49.333
You're the Duke!

01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:54.833
You're the Duke!

01:29:56.625 --> 01:29:58.250
You're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One.

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.375
The tape, Plissken.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.291
That's it.

01:31:23.333 --> 01:31:25.958
I radioed ahead, Mr. President.
They know the situation.

01:31:26.041 --> 01:31:28.625
They're waiting for your broadcast.

01:31:34.916 --> 01:31:36.416
Yeah. Oh, it's all right.

01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:45.708
I, uh... I want to thank you.

01:31:47.416 --> 01:31:50.416
Anything you want... you just name it.

01:31:50.416 --> 01:31:53.833
Just a moment of your time.

01:31:53.916 --> 01:31:55.500
Three minutes, sir.

01:31:55.625 --> 01:31:59.125
Yes?

01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:02.000
We did get you out.

01:32:02.125 --> 01:32:05.791
A lot of people died in the process.
I just wondered how you felt about it.

01:32:05.916 --> 01:32:07.291
Well, I...

01:32:08.791 --> 01:32:11.083
I want to thank them.

01:32:11.208 --> 01:32:14.083
This nation appreciates their sacrifice.

01:32:20.375 --> 01:32:25.375
Look, uh, I'm on the air in...
Two and a half minutes?

01:32:25.375 --> 01:32:26.875
Yes, sir.

01:32:55.166 --> 01:32:57.666
You going to kill me now, Snake?

01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:59.833
I'm too tired.

01:33:01.166 --> 01:33:03.041
Maybe later.

01:33:03.166 --> 01:33:05.958
I've got another deal for you.

01:33:05.958 --> 01:33:08.333
I've got another deal for you
while you're resting.

01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:12.333
I want to give you a job.

01:33:13.416 --> 01:33:15.416
We'd make one hell of a team, Snake.

01:33:20.416 --> 01:33:23.208
The name's Plissken.

01:33:32.416 --> 01:33:36.125
You're on camera, Mr. President.

01:33:36.125 --> 01:33:37.625
Good evening.

01:33:38.916 --> 01:33:44.708
Although I shall not be present
at this historic summit meeting...

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.791
I present this...

01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:51.208
in the hope...

01:33:51.291 --> 01:33:54.708
that our great nations ...

01:33:54.791 --> 01:33:58.291
may learn to live in peace.
