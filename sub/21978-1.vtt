Fudge. Let's see. Tofu
and bean sprouts.

01:10.288 --> 01:13.597
Peanut butter and jelly. Desiccated 
liver and herbed wheat germ.

01:13.598 --> 01:15.836
Come on, Michelangelo.
Think healthy for a change.

01:15.837 --> 01:18.979
You had peanut butter and jelly 
on your pizza last night.

01:18.980 --> 01:20.984
No way, bud.

01:20.985 --> 01:23.491
I had chocolate chips
and caramel fudge.

01:25.598 --> 01:28.539
ok, lady. put all
your money in a bag.

01:28.540 --> 01:31.045
will that be paper
or plastic ?

01:31.046 --> 01:33.486
don't be a wise guy.
just do it.

01:33.487 --> 01:35.659
all right.
only don't hurt me.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.399
Michelangelo, look.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.408
check out the
checkout counter.

01:41.409 --> 01:43.346
those 2 scuzz buckets
are holding up the place.

01:43.347 --> 01:44.784
But not for long.

01:44.785 --> 01:48.528
Let's show 'em some turtle
crime fighting tactics.

01:51.470 --> 01:54.210
hai-yip-ta-da !

01:54.211 --> 01:56.082
who are you guys ?

01:56.083 --> 01:58.689
we're here to
take out the garbage.

01:58.690 --> 02:02.232
play ball,
creeps.

02:02.233 --> 02:04.372
so you want to
play dirty, huh ?

02:05.476 --> 02:08.080
strike one, dude.

02:08.082 --> 02:09.786
strike 2.

02:09.787 --> 02:11.825
ha ha ! you missed !

02:11.826 --> 02:14.300
you think so ?

02:16.105 --> 02:19.347
strike 3. you're out !

02:19.348 --> 02:22.120
back off, weirdo.

02:22.121 --> 02:24.193
yechhh ! eggs.

02:24.194 --> 02:26.399
uh-oh, the boys in blue.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.171
we better book.

02:28.172 --> 02:29.374
right. but first...

02:34.624 --> 02:36.494
hey, what happened ?

02:36.495 --> 02:37.497
let us out of here !

02:37.498 --> 02:39.670
gift-wrapped
for the police.

02:39.671 --> 02:41.909
could you check us out
fast, ma'am ?

02:41.910 --> 02:43.481
we're in an awful
big hurry.

02:43.482 --> 02:45.854
you're the ones
who saved my life.

02:45.855 --> 02:46.957
it's on the house.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.330
oh, radical !

02:49.331 --> 02:51.603
uh-oh, here they come.

02:51.604 --> 02:54.611
Cowabunga !

02:57.286 --> 03:00.528
this is April O'Neill
of channel 6.

03:00.529 --> 03:03.469
<i>oh, right,
the happy hour news. </i>

03:03.470 --> 03:05.675
exactly what
took place here ?

03:05.676 --> 03:07.146
these hoodlums
tried to rob me.

03:07.147 --> 03:10.254
Then suddenly these turtles
showed up.

03:10.255 --> 03:12.327
did you say turtles ?

03:12.328 --> 03:15.570
uh... maybe they
were alligators.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.441
i didn't have
my glasses on.

03:17.442 --> 03:19.915
and so once again,
a crime was prevented

03:19.916 --> 03:21.887
by a group
of heroic turtles.

03:21.888 --> 03:23.625
oh, then again,

03:23.626 --> 03:25.731
it could've been
salamanders.

03:25.732 --> 03:28.305
those things all
look alike to me.

03:31.081 --> 03:34.556
i tell you, Krang,
our defeat was an accident.

03:34.557 --> 03:37.999
send me back to earth,
and i'll prove what i can do.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.408
Krang, i implore you.
send me back.

03:41.409 --> 03:43.848
send me back.
send me back.

03:43.849 --> 03:47.090
i'm tired of your
endless whining.

03:47.091 --> 03:49.932
i will send you
back to earth.

03:49.933 --> 03:52.004
you will not regret this,
Krang.

03:52.005 --> 03:55.982
take this communicator.
and this time,

03:55.983 --> 03:59.625
put an end to
this turtle business.

04:04.473 --> 04:08.751
earth, make way
for Bebop and Rocksteady.

04:08.752 --> 04:11.993
and away we go.

04:11.994 --> 04:13.197
hey !

04:15.704 --> 04:18.010
why'd you do that ?

04:18.011 --> 04:23.024
because i enjoy seeing
both people and animals suffer.

04:23.025 --> 04:25.798
and you, my friends,
are both.

04:32.718 --> 04:35.391
April, thank heavens
you're back.

04:35.392 --> 04:37.063
there's a terrible
emergency.

04:37.064 --> 04:39.069
what is it, irma ?

04:39.070 --> 04:40.505
i chipped
one of my nails,

04:40.506 --> 04:42.077
and i'm all out of
this color polish.

04:42.078 --> 04:43.146
please, irma,

04:43.147 --> 04:44.584
i've got a problem.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.754
you've got a problem ?

04:45.755 --> 04:48.427
what if some hunky guy
calls me for a date ?

04:48.428 --> 04:51.102
well, April, did you
get the story ?

04:51.103 --> 04:52.773
not on film,
mr. thompson.

04:52.774 --> 04:55.614
but i just know
the turtles were there.

04:55.615 --> 04:58.455
i'll bet they were. Probably holding 
up the place.

04:58.456 --> 05:01.163
wrong. they're heroes,
i tell you.

05:01.164 --> 05:05.342
bushwa. those turtles are the 
greatest threat our city's ever faced.

05:05.343 --> 05:09.018
you must help expose those 
mutants for what they really are.

05:09.019 --> 05:11.158
a menace to society.

05:11.159 --> 05:13.497
but--but i couldn't
do that.

05:13.498 --> 05:16.072
then i'll find
someone else who can.

05:16.073 --> 05:17.341
right, Vernon ?

05:17.342 --> 05:19.246
oh, i agree, mr. Thompson.

05:19.247 --> 05:22.289
those turtles are nothing
but a slimy green pestilence.

05:22.290 --> 05:24.160
what brought that on ?

05:24.161 --> 05:27.136
i think the answer
is right there.

05:27.137 --> 05:30.010
ohh, burnesie.

05:30.011 --> 05:32.818
you're so manly when you give 
orders like that.

05:32.819 --> 05:35.893
why, yes, i suppose
i am.

05:35.894 --> 05:39.136
i just hate turtles

05:39.137 --> 05:42.645
ever since my brother put one in 
my bed when i was 5 years old.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.316
don't worry, my dear.

05:44.317 --> 05:47.158
i'll protect you from this dreaded
reptile menace.

05:47.159 --> 05:49.899
that's why he's on my case
about the turtles.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.938
if you don't think
you can handle it...

05:51.939 --> 05:53.543
don't sweat it, Vernon.

05:53.544 --> 05:56.517
if i had to, i'd do an interview
with bigfoot.

05:56.518 --> 05:59.024
if you do, find out
if he's married.

06:03.772 --> 06:05.742
hey, Michelangelo
told us

06:05.743 --> 06:08.150
how you trashed those
2 punks in the supermarket.

06:08.151 --> 06:10.121
just our luck
to miss it.

06:10.122 --> 06:11.426
we could've used
the workout.

06:11.427 --> 06:13.765
oh, those dudes
were easy.

06:13.766 --> 06:16.272
not like taking on
Shredder's foot ninjas.

06:16.273 --> 06:18.110
kinda weird, you know ?

06:18.111 --> 06:19.481
if it wasn't for Shredder,

06:19.482 --> 06:22.189
we'd still be
4 tiny pet turtles.

06:22.190 --> 06:23.492
for sure.

06:23.493 --> 06:25.732
that was pretty cool
the way his mutating gel

06:25.733 --> 06:26.968
made us grow.

06:26.969 --> 06:30.077
yeah, but that same gel
left our master Splinter

06:30.078 --> 06:32.150
trapped in the form
of a rat.

06:32.151 --> 06:34.222
boy, i'd like to go
one on one

06:34.223 --> 06:35.626
with that shred head.

06:35.627 --> 06:37.264
Forget it, Raphael.

06:37.265 --> 06:39.169
Shredder's stuck
in Dimension x

06:39.170 --> 06:41.943
along with that flipped-out
brain creature Krang.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.651
Leonardo, Donatello,

06:44.652 --> 06:48.361
Michelangelo, Raphael.

06:48.362 --> 06:50.600
master, Splinter,
what is it ?

06:50.601 --> 06:53.609
i have had a terrible
premonition.

06:53.610 --> 06:56.584
my life-long enemy,
saki the Shredder,

06:56.585 --> 06:57.955
is about to return.

06:57.956 --> 06:59.158
Shredder ?

06:59.159 --> 07:00.462
but that's impossible.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.969
we saw him sucked
into Dimension x.

07:02.970 --> 07:06.812
evil that strong cannot
be so easily overcome.

07:06.813 --> 07:09.988
i sense
terrible danger ahead.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.972
this sure is a slow day.

07:15.973 --> 07:18.813
we ain't mugged anybody
for a whole half hour.

07:18.814 --> 07:22.957
relax, pal. Some poor sucker's
bound to show up.

07:25.165 --> 07:26.233
aaahhh !

07:26.234 --> 07:27.871
ha ha. see ?

07:27.872 --> 07:29.443
what did i tell ya ?

07:29.444 --> 07:31.949
ohh, where am i ?

07:31.950 --> 07:34.255
i got a better question.

07:34.256 --> 07:37.431
how much money you got
in that stupid costume of yours ?

07:37.432 --> 07:40.974
of course.
i'm in the big apple.

07:40.975 --> 07:43.548
foot soldiers,
Bebop, Rocksteady,

07:43.549 --> 07:45.553
destroy these fools.

07:45.555 --> 07:46.824
that old trick ?

07:46.825 --> 07:49.164
forget it, pal.
it won't work.

07:49.165 --> 07:52.306
foot soldiers, did you
not hear my command ?

07:52.307 --> 07:54.846
now just hand over
your dough.

07:54.847 --> 07:57.821
i'll just have to
handle this myself.

08:03.471 --> 08:07.214
now... what were you
saying about money ?

08:07.215 --> 08:09.052
we were saying, here,

08:09.053 --> 08:11.125
if you don't have any,
take ours.

08:11.126 --> 08:14.869
yeah, yeah,
and have a nice day.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.409
Krang,
where is my army

08:17.410 --> 08:19.983
and my Technodrome
and all my weapons ?

08:19.984 --> 08:25.030
you failed to defeat
those miserable turtles

08:25.031 --> 08:27.771
and their teacher Splinter
with my help.

08:27.772 --> 08:31.749
now you must destroy them
on your own.

08:31.750 --> 08:36.294
i will never give you
another speck of aid

08:36.296 --> 08:39.203
until you prove
worthy of it.

08:39.203 --> 08:41.376
i will show you, Krang.

08:41.376 --> 08:43.649
i will destroy
my enemies the turtles,

08:43.650 --> 08:48.729
and then the world will tremble 
before the Shredder.

08:52.106 --> 08:56.116
hmm, the slash
for cash dojo,

08:56.117 --> 09:00.697
the perfect place to begin operation
turtle destruction.

09:02.803 --> 09:05.309
oh, no, no, no !

09:05.310 --> 09:07.649
what a bunch
of useless wimps.

09:07.650 --> 09:10.825
the master is responsible
for the students.

09:10.826 --> 09:14.134
look, clown. nobody
talks like that to smash,

09:14.135 --> 09:17.008
master of
the slash for cash dojo.

09:17.009 --> 09:20.318
i am now master
of this dojo,

09:20.319 --> 09:23.092
and you will obey
my every command

09:23.093 --> 09:24.194
or else.

09:24.195 --> 09:26.702
or else what, tin face ?

09:26.703 --> 09:28.273
yaaahh !

09:31.382 --> 09:33.187
like i was saying, master,

09:33.188 --> 09:35.359
you're the boss.

09:41.577 --> 09:43.482
you got back
just in time, April.

09:45.087 --> 09:47.928
what about you, April ?
anything on those turtles yet ?

09:47.929 --> 09:50.134
well, no,
but you see, i...

09:50.135 --> 09:52.507
oh, burnesie.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.148
it's lonely in there
without you.

09:55.149 --> 09:57.053
you heard me.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.624
don't come back
without proof

09:58.625 --> 10:01.097
of some insidious
turtle conspiracy.

10:01.098 --> 10:02.501
i'm trying
to tell you.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.708
the turtles
are not a threat.

10:04.709 --> 10:06.814
they just want to be
left alone.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.889
ohh ! ooh ! don't
let her near me.

10:09.890 --> 10:11.995
she's a nasty
old turtle lover.

10:11.996 --> 10:15.003
there, there.
you're safe with me.

10:15.004 --> 10:17.342
i'll get you
a story, all right.

10:17.343 --> 10:20.351
one that proves
the turtles are heroes.

10:20.352 --> 10:22.089
hee-ya !
hee-ya !

10:22.090 --> 10:24.729
hi-ya !
hi-ya !

10:24.730 --> 10:25.967
excellent.

10:25.968 --> 10:27.470
under my tutelage,

10:27.471 --> 10:30.145
you are ready
for action at last.

10:30.146 --> 10:31.816
ok, you former wimps

10:31.817 --> 10:34.992
now belong to the crooked
ninja turtle gang.

10:34.993 --> 10:37.432
each of you
will be given
one of these to wear

10:37.433 --> 10:38.568
when we strike.

10:38.569 --> 10:40.941
and strike we shall.

10:44.285 --> 10:46.156
don't anybody move !

10:46.157 --> 10:49.264
we're the crooked
ninja turtle gang.

10:49.265 --> 10:53.577
and when you
tell the cops,

10:53.578 --> 10:55.448
if anybody asks,

10:55.449 --> 10:58.424
we're the crooked
ninja turtle gang.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.994
yaaa !

10:59.995 --> 11:02.835
and i thought they were
such nice boys.

11:07.617 --> 11:08.852
yaahhh !

11:10.658 --> 11:14.836
remember, we're the
crooked ninja turtle gang.

11:14.837 --> 11:16.306
here's our card.

11:16.307 --> 11:19.549
The jewelry store,
it's just been burglarized.

11:19.550 --> 11:20.752
it's the robbers.

11:20.753 --> 11:22.156
make sure you get 'em.

11:22.157 --> 11:24.596
mr. thompson
will be thrilled.

11:24.597 --> 11:27.638
it was those awful teenage mutant
ninja turtles.

11:27.639 --> 11:29.577
those weren't
the turtles.

11:29.578 --> 11:32.017
they were teenagers, they were 
ninjas, and they were green.

11:32.018 --> 11:33.621
now, what would
you call them ?

11:35.695 --> 11:39.705
well, Shredder, what
have you to report ?

11:39.706 --> 11:42.246
ha ha. my mock
turtle ninjas

11:42.247 --> 11:43.783
have been
terrorizing the city

11:43.784 --> 11:45.889
with a glorious
crime spree.

11:45.890 --> 11:47.995
with the citizens
turned against them,

11:47.996 --> 11:50.969
soon the real turtles will
be forced to the surface

11:50.970 --> 11:52.909
to clear their name.

11:52.910 --> 11:54.847
you call that a plan ?

11:54.848 --> 11:56.618
that will take forever.

11:56.619 --> 11:58.290
i want results now.

11:58.291 --> 11:59.426
now ! now !

11:59.427 --> 12:00.429
don't contact me

12:00.430 --> 12:04.073
until you have real
progress to report.

12:04.074 --> 12:05.410
good-bye.

12:05.411 --> 12:09.454
ohh, that leaves me
just one place to turn.

12:09.455 --> 12:13.165
and then i said loose a horde of
robot rat catchers.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.273
but unfortunately, we were defeated
by a talking rat

12:16.274 --> 12:17.811
and some ninja turtles.

12:17.812 --> 12:19.515
<i>Sacre bleu !</i>

12:19.516 --> 12:24.998
We never had such problems
when i ruled france.

12:24.999 --> 12:27.839
ahh, baxter stockman.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.410
i've come for you.

12:29.411 --> 12:32.084
ze peasants
are revolting.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.226
<i>au revoir,
mon ami. </i>

12:35.227 --> 12:37.700
oh, please don't hurt me,
master Shredder.

12:37.701 --> 12:40.307
i promise i'll never
fail you again.

12:40.308 --> 12:41.878
oh, stop sniveling.

12:41.879 --> 12:44.819
i need you to build the ultimate
rat catcher.

12:44.820 --> 12:47.460
yes, master.
i know just the thing.

12:47.461 --> 12:48.596
look. every day,

12:48.597 --> 12:51.471
i watch them digging
a tunnel with it.

12:51.472 --> 12:53.878
good. it will
serve us well.

12:53.879 --> 12:56.085
when i'm finished
redesigning this thing,

12:56.086 --> 12:58.624
not a rat in this city
will be safe.

12:58.625 --> 13:00.229
hee hee.

13:00.230 --> 13:02.435
aha, there's proof.

13:02.436 --> 13:05.945
and you call these
turtles of yours heroes.

13:05.946 --> 13:09.121
but i tell you, those weren't
the ninja turtles.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.126
we'll run it
on the 11:00 news.

13:11.127 --> 13:12.998
and that's an order.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.873
Leonardo, this is April.

13:15.874 --> 13:17.411
come in, Leonardo.

13:17.412 --> 13:20.050
hi, April, it's Donatello.
what's up ?

13:20.051 --> 13:23.493
hurry down to the channel 6 offices.
it's an emergency.

13:23.494 --> 13:27.204
you turtles are about to be declared
public enemy number one !

13:27.205 --> 13:29.544
whoa, check it out.

13:29.545 --> 13:31.416
we're at the top
of the charts.

13:31.417 --> 13:33.856
yeah. number one
with a bullet.

13:33.857 --> 13:36.530
quit clowning, you guys.
this is serious.

13:36.531 --> 13:38.703
we'll be right there.

13:38.704 --> 13:41.443
look, April's left
the light on for us.

13:41.444 --> 13:44.084
yo, April, grab on.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.906
now tell us about
this big emergency.

13:51.907 --> 13:53.979
yeah, like,
what's the haps ?

13:53.980 --> 13:55.850
better yet,
i'll show you.

13:55.851 --> 13:57.722
a group called the crooked
ninja turtle gang

13:57.723 --> 14:00.429
has been committing robberies
all over the city.

14:00.430 --> 14:04.775
whoa, scope out
those awesome outfits.

14:04.776 --> 14:06.613
you gotta admit
they do know how to dress.

14:06.614 --> 14:09.154
hold on, there's
something familiar

14:09.155 --> 14:11.159
about that guy's
technique.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.399
you're right. i've seen it before
someplace.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.206
there are only 2 sensei who could've
taught them that.

14:16.207 --> 14:18.079
Splinter or...

14:18.080 --> 14:19.115
you don't mean...

14:19.116 --> 14:20.619
i'm afraid i do.

14:20.620 --> 14:21.622
Shredder.

14:21.623 --> 14:24.129
aaahhhh !

14:24.130 --> 14:25.968
we're under attack.

14:25.969 --> 14:27.204
it's a sonic
death ray.

14:27.205 --> 14:29.544
turtles !

14:29.545 --> 14:31.450
it's them,
the ninja crooks.

14:31.451 --> 14:33.889
help. somebody
call security.

14:33.890 --> 14:35.895
guys, it's time
to make tracks.

14:35.896 --> 14:37.199
let's stay in touch.

14:40.643 --> 14:44.184
just what were those
green terrorists doing here ?

14:44.185 --> 14:47.227
i... um...
i lured them here

14:47.228 --> 14:49.533
in order
to, uh, uh...
expose them.

14:49.534 --> 14:51.873
<i>and exactly what
are you doing here ?</i>

14:51.874 --> 14:53.544
tell her, snookums.

14:53.545 --> 14:56.185
well, i was...
i mean... i--i...

14:56.186 --> 14:57.188
never mind !

14:57.189 --> 14:59.293
good work, April.
carry on.

15:00.431 --> 15:04.007
what is that
strange noise ?

15:04.008 --> 15:09.622
it's no use running from the ultimate
rat catching machine.

15:11.295 --> 15:14.202
it seems
there's no way out.

15:22.125 --> 15:25.968
master Splinter, we have
some bad news to--

15:25.969 --> 15:27.171
he's gone.

15:27.172 --> 15:29.277
someone or something
broke in.

15:29.278 --> 15:31.282
this has to be
Shredder's work.

15:31.283 --> 15:34.726
either that or some
totally humongous termite.

15:34.727 --> 15:36.296
let's go.

15:41.712 --> 15:43.884
here's where
the trail ends.

15:43.885 --> 15:47.394
and here's where
the trouble begins.

15:47.395 --> 15:51.338
you wimps are about to become
turtle toe jam.

15:59.562 --> 16:01.433
we'll just see
about that.

16:01.434 --> 16:04.274
ok, ninja punks.
get 'em !

16:04.275 --> 16:06.748
hyah !
hyah !

16:08.119 --> 16:10.191
come and get me,
hot shots.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.981
Michelangelo,
watch it.

16:22.191 --> 16:25.801
don't forget
to write, dudes.

16:25.802 --> 16:29.043
come on, guys, you can
do better than that.

16:31.618 --> 16:34.391
here, try these on for size.

16:35.629 --> 16:38.369
what do you know ?
a perfect fit.

16:38.370 --> 16:40.608
creep number 2,
comin' up.

16:42.615 --> 16:47.394
I've been working
on the oil drums 

16:47.395 --> 16:50.837
no hard feelings.

16:50.838 --> 16:51.973
uh, right, guys ?

16:51.974 --> 16:52.976
right.

16:56.286 --> 16:58.224
i'm only gonna
ask you once.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.963
where's Shredder ?

16:59.964 --> 17:01.066
he left you a message.

17:01.067 --> 17:02.536
right there.

17:07.584 --> 17:09.455
we dare.
we dare.

17:09.457 --> 17:11.996
hi, guys. i got here
as soon as i--

17:11.997 --> 17:13.834
uh-oh, there's
been trouble here.

17:13.835 --> 17:15.906
this probably isn't
very smart, but...

17:15.907 --> 17:17.979
they might need
my help.

17:17.980 --> 17:22.358
you do not truly believe
your students can defeat mine.

17:22.358 --> 17:25.300
those clumsy fools
i trained ?

17:25.300 --> 17:26.470
ha ha ha ha.

17:26.471 --> 17:28.943
they were merely a way of delaying
the turtles

17:28.944 --> 17:30.714
until i could
complete my trap.

17:30.715 --> 17:33.255
now i can destroy
all of you.

17:33.256 --> 17:35.127
no matter what
you do to me,

17:35.128 --> 17:37.868
my turtles will
defeat you, Shredder.

17:37.869 --> 17:39.405
that's telling him,
master.

17:39.406 --> 17:43.250
Shredder, if you dare touch
a whisker on his head...

17:43.251 --> 17:45.856
irma, send my news crew
on the double.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.096
i've got a hot lead
on the turtle story.

17:48.097 --> 17:49.199
not another step,

17:49.200 --> 17:51.573
or your furry sensei
will be crushed.

17:51.574 --> 17:55.617
a rope. it leads to
a battering ram.

17:55.618 --> 17:58.124
it's gotta weigh
megatons.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.130
none of us could
stop that thing.

18:00.131 --> 18:01.533
that's right, turtles.

18:01.534 --> 18:04.409
your master is
about to become history.

18:08.186 --> 18:10.058
yo, bummer, guys.

18:10.059 --> 18:13.166
looks like we've got us
a massive problemo.

18:13.167 --> 18:17.177
greetings from your friendly 
neighborhood rat catcher.

18:17.178 --> 18:18.280
baxter ?

18:18.281 --> 18:19.684
don't you just hate it

18:19.685 --> 18:21.957
when people
drop in unannounced ?

18:26.805 --> 18:28.909
talking turtles.

18:28.910 --> 18:31.450
big green talking turtles.

18:31.451 --> 18:33.790
say sayonara, Splinter.

18:33.791 --> 18:34.726
heh heh heh.

18:48.532 --> 18:50.804
way to go, dudes !

18:50.805 --> 18:54.180
save me, master.
save me.

18:54.181 --> 18:56.453
oh, useless jellyfish.

18:56.454 --> 18:58.625
i have to do
everything myself.

18:58.626 --> 19:00.030
yaaahh !

19:04.510 --> 19:06.682
where are the brakes
on this thing ?

19:06.683 --> 19:08.420
the battering ram.

19:13.167 --> 19:15.239
Raphael, jump !

19:20.120 --> 19:22.526
you have done well,
my students.

19:22.527 --> 19:23.796
well, we're not
done yet.

19:23.797 --> 19:25.600
where's the Shredder
gone to ?

19:25.601 --> 19:28.876
you haven't seen
the last of me, mutants.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.417
this is only
the beginning.

19:32.555 --> 19:34.827
uh-oh, that's
our cue to exit.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.085
oh, no, i don't
believe it.

19:44.086 --> 19:46.258
it looks like
world war 11 !

19:46.259 --> 19:48.431
roll tape, fellas.
we've got a story

19:48.432 --> 19:51.105
that's gonna knock
the boss' socks off.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.612
but i tell you
the plan was working

19:53.613 --> 19:56.119
until that idiot baxter
messed things up.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.991
no excuses.

19:57.992 --> 20:00.698
you were beaten
once again.

20:02.104 --> 20:03.740
bozo.

20:03.741 --> 20:05.579
ha ha. yeah.

20:05.580 --> 20:06.815
bozo.

20:06.816 --> 20:09.222
until you prove yourself,

20:09.223 --> 20:12.899
you will not get one shred
of help from me.

20:14.505 --> 20:18.448
i vow to destroy Splinter
and his accursed turtles,

20:18.449 --> 20:21.156
and i will not rest
until i do.

20:21.157 --> 20:24.197
this is April O'Neill
of channel 6 news.

20:24.198 --> 20:26.938
today the notorious
crooked ninja turtle gang

20:26.939 --> 20:28.041
was captured

20:28.042 --> 20:30.448
and revealed
for the hoax they are,

20:30.449 --> 20:32.052
proving once and for all

20:32.053 --> 20:35.362
that there's no such thing
as the green turtle menace.

20:35.363 --> 20:40.576
Burnesie, how dare you let her say
such a thing !

20:40.577 --> 20:42.849
but, tiffany, honey,
it's the truth.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.553
admit it.

20:44.554 --> 20:46.927
you love turtles,
don't you ?

20:46.928 --> 20:48.297
no, no, baby.

20:48.298 --> 20:50.437
i hate turtles, honest.

20:50.438 --> 20:51.907
here's your lunch,
boss.

20:51.908 --> 20:55.150
let's see. uh... you ordered the
mock turtle soup.

20:55.151 --> 20:56.954
what ?

20:56.955 --> 21:00.130
i knew you were
a lousy turtle lover.

21:02.337 --> 21:04.175
good-bye !

21:04.176 --> 21:06.481
i guess she's not
a soup lover either.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.721
so far, no one knows
the identity

21:08.722 --> 21:10.325
of the mysterious
green heroes

21:10.326 --> 21:12.130
who stopped
this crime spree.

21:12.131 --> 21:13.936
but whoever you are,

21:13.937 --> 21:15.306
thanks.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.212
right on, babe.

21:17.213 --> 21:18.648
she was winking
at me, you know.

21:18.649 --> 21:20.453
you're totally
warped, dude.

21:20.454 --> 21:21.758
she was winking
at me.

21:21.759 --> 21:24.899
get real, you guys.
it was meant for yours truly.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.504
I hate to argue, fellas,

21:26.505 --> 21:28.843
but i think she
meant it for me.

21:31.685 --> 21:32.754
Cool it, fellas.

21:32.755 --> 21:33.924
If you must know,

21:33.925 --> 21:34.927
I was winking at...

21:34.928 --> 21:36.598
Splinter.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.771
I don't believe that !
