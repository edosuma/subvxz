03:55.641 --> 03:59.680
- Pretty girl.
- Sweaty girl.

04:19.197 --> 04:22.167
Shit.
Where'd you park?

04:22.169 --> 04:26.705
Walked up from the co-op.
Something wrong?

04:26.707 --> 04:28.640
Senior's here.

04:28.642 --> 04:30.842
Chase and Meryl too.

04:30.844 --> 04:33.147
You think I'm
scared of Senior?

04:40.053 --> 04:42.290
Jody?

04:44.056 --> 04:46.023
She's, uh, coming.

04:46.025 --> 04:49.361
Maybe it's time we tell him
about us and get it over with.

04:49.363 --> 04:50.828
Us?

04:50.830 --> 04:52.299
There is no us
to tell him about.

04:56.036 --> 04:57.902
Red, that's not what I meant.
I just... you know,

04:57.904 --> 05:00.171
he wouldn't...
he wouldn't understand this.

05:00.173 --> 05:02.207
Yeah, well, that makes
two of us now.

05:02.209 --> 05:05.109
Let's really not
make this a thing.

05:05.111 --> 05:07.111
Apparently it ain't
a thing at all.

05:09.815 --> 05:12.751
Red, we've talked about this.

05:12.753 --> 05:14.589
Yeah, we have.

05:19.825 --> 05:23.193
Jody?

05:23.195 --> 05:25.231
I'm coming.

05:40.780 --> 05:45.883
Come in.
What's going on?

05:45.885 --> 05:48.222
We need to talk to you.

05:50.823 --> 05:52.926
Why are you back?

06:00.133 --> 06:01.900
Did something happen to Mimi?

06:01.902 --> 06:04.337
No, no, Annabelle's fine.

06:06.772 --> 06:08.405
Uh...

06:08.407 --> 06:13.244
we, uh, had a meeting
with the governor today...

06:13.246 --> 06:16.950
and, uh... Billy Croyle's
getting released.

06:33.233 --> 06:37.902
- So the governor pardoned him?
- No, not quite, not pardoned.

06:37.904 --> 06:43.974
His sentence has been commuted.
It's, like, reduced.

06:43.976 --> 06:49.414
Yeah, he was pardoned
on account of his kid, Collin.

06:49.416 --> 06:52.116
It's not pardoned.
It's commuted.

06:52.118 --> 06:54.285
The governor's not saying
he's innocent,

06:54.287 --> 06:58.388
just the trial's smelly.

06:58.390 --> 07:02.160
Look, the county attorney
said the more Collin pushed,

07:02.162 --> 07:04.395
the more he got
to feeling guilty...

07:04.397 --> 07:08.967
said he felt like Don and him
hadn't done due diligence.

07:08.969 --> 07:10.902
I don't know.

07:10.904 --> 07:12.871
Really, the problem
here is Billy's hat.

07:12.873 --> 07:15.039
I mean, an eyewitness says
that she saw

07:15.041 --> 07:16.941
Laurie take it out of Baileys'
that night...

07:16.943 --> 07:18.075
It doesn't matter
whether she did

07:18.077 --> 07:21.179
or didn't pick up the damn hat.

07:21.181 --> 07:25.083
- It does matter.
- I'm not about to debate this.

07:25.085 --> 07:28.820
There's no point.

07:28.822 --> 07:31.489
Now, listen, I know
what I'm about to say

07:31.491 --> 07:33.157
is gonna sting a little bit,

07:33.159 --> 07:35.426
but we need you to pack a bag

07:35.428 --> 07:37.195
and come on back out
to the ranch

07:37.197 --> 07:40.297
till we can figure out
how to deal with this.

07:40.299 --> 07:42.032
No, I most
certainly will not.

07:42.034 --> 07:45.804
Billy Croyle hates
this entire family.

07:45.806 --> 07:47.838
He hates us with a vengeance,

07:47.840 --> 07:50.008
and the only way
I can protect you

07:50.010 --> 07:51.275
is by having you on the ranch.

07:51.277 --> 07:52.376
I know you think
you're all grown up

07:52.378 --> 07:53.845
and ready for the world,

07:53.847 --> 07:57.314
but you're still
a child, sweetheart.

07:57.316 --> 07:59.583
I, against my better judgment,
let you move down here

07:59.585 --> 08:01.186
in the first place.

08:01.188 --> 08:02.854
It's not a good place
for you to be, this house.

08:02.856 --> 08:04.188
- Hey, Pop... Pop!
- Listen, I know Belle and you

08:04.190 --> 08:05.189
- had some kind of idea...
- Pop, Pop!

08:05.191 --> 08:06.493
I think you made your point.

08:14.133 --> 08:17.001
Hey, just look at it like this.

08:17.003 --> 08:21.104
We can spend some time
catching up.

08:21.106 --> 08:22.142
Kay?

08:24.411 --> 08:26.210
Okay.

08:26.212 --> 08:28.145
Okay, fine.

08:28.147 --> 08:32.282
Yeah, I'll come back.

08:32.284 --> 08:34.154
I'll be back before dinner.

08:38.158 --> 08:40.591
Okay.

10:03.309 --> 10:04.410
Jody?

10:08.515 --> 10:10.214
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Hey, hey, hey... wait, wait,

10:10.216 --> 10:11.715
no, no, just...
just let me speak.

10:11.717 --> 10:13.117
- No, I don't want to hear it.
- Okay... no, no,

10:13.119 --> 10:14.719
I-I had to do it, okay?
I...

10:14.721 --> 10:17.120
- No, you didn't.
- No, please, will you just...

10:17.122 --> 10:18.489
will you just
try to listen to me?

10:18.491 --> 10:20.057
What?
What do you want to say to me?

10:20.059 --> 10:23.226
I didn't exactly want
to get him out either.

10:23.228 --> 10:26.531
You and your dad
are exactly the same.

10:26.533 --> 10:28.966
You don't take responsibility
for what you did.

10:28.968 --> 10:31.002
- I didn't...
- Don't fucking touch me.

10:31.004 --> 10:34.341
Hey! Look, just...
just listen to me, okay?

10:37.610 --> 10:42.647
Okay, so-so... the night...
that everything happened,

10:42.649 --> 10:44.585
the police asked me
if he left the house.

10:47.286 --> 10:49.422
And I said that I didn't know.

10:52.491 --> 10:55.225
But I did.
I lied.

10:55.227 --> 10:57.394
I mean, he didn't move
a muscle that night.

10:57.396 --> 11:00.364
I watched him until dawn.

11:00.366 --> 11:02.133
I-I could have told
the sheriff what happened

11:02.135 --> 11:04.369
that night,
and I didn't...

11:04.371 --> 11:06.606
because I wanted to see him go.

11:10.776 --> 11:13.079
Are you done?

11:30.462 --> 11:33.031
So is that how
this is gonna go?

11:33.033 --> 11:35.298
I come out here
as a courtesy call to tell you

11:35.300 --> 11:38.369
that now that the case
is back on my books,

11:38.371 --> 11:40.370
I'm gonna have to look
at all possible suspects,

11:40.372 --> 11:42.072
and this is what I get?

11:42.074 --> 11:44.441
You should have ran an
honest investigation, Don.

11:44.443 --> 11:46.744
Well, that's a hell
of a thing to say.

11:46.746 --> 11:49.147
Mind explaining exactly
what you mean by that?

11:49.149 --> 11:51.215
You sat on evidence
from the defense.

11:51.217 --> 11:53.683
I "sat on evidence"?

11:53.685 --> 11:55.686
And why would
you have wanted that?

11:55.688 --> 11:57.055
You got something
you want to say?

11:57.057 --> 11:59.690
Okay, easy, fellas.
Come on.

11:59.692 --> 12:02.292
He would have wanted that
so we wouldn't have this,

12:02.294 --> 12:04.829
here and now...

12:04.831 --> 12:07.301
a guilty man
walking out of prison.

12:10.135 --> 12:12.737
Senior, you should
know something.

12:12.739 --> 12:14.604
I talked to Billy
a few hours ago,

12:14.606 --> 12:16.807
and I told him... I told him...

12:16.809 --> 12:19.143
if any harm came
to a Linder, hell,

12:19.145 --> 12:21.678
if one of you got so much
as a paper cut,

12:21.680 --> 12:25.715
I'd be on his ass
like flies on shit.

12:25.717 --> 12:28.853
And you know what he told me?

12:28.855 --> 12:31.589
If any harm came to a Linder,

12:31.591 --> 12:34.260
that's something he'd gladly
go back to jail for.

12:40.732 --> 12:42.770
Let you get back
to your dinner.

12:57.317 --> 12:59.617
Gonna smoke a cigarette.

14:01.880 --> 14:05.449
Tell me about my mom.

14:05.451 --> 14:06.854
Well...

14:10.289 --> 14:12.860
Still might be the prettiest
women I ever seen.

14:17.362 --> 14:21.398
Definitely the world's
worst cook.

14:21.400 --> 14:25.670
And your dad...
he'd just eat every damn bite

14:25.672 --> 14:29.840
of whatever disgusting thing it
was she slid in front of him.

14:29.842 --> 14:32.442
That was your dad.

14:32.444 --> 14:34.644
Always doing the right thing.

14:34.646 --> 14:36.647
Ain't gonna lie, it was
annoying as hell sometimes,

14:36.649 --> 14:40.317
especially when I wanted
to get into some trouble.

14:40.319 --> 14:43.387
It was like
I had Senior with me.

14:43.389 --> 14:45.359
They a lot alike?

14:49.696 --> 14:51.798
Yeah, it was scary sometimes.

14:53.765 --> 14:56.901
But my dad was
definitely friendlier.

14:56.903 --> 14:59.604
Yeah, but I mean, come on.
How hard is that?

15:06.578 --> 15:09.415
Promise me you're gonna be
smart about all this, kay?

15:14.953 --> 15:17.723
Yeah.

16:31.364 --> 16:34.498
You disgusting pig.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.000
This town ain't full of
chickenshits after all.

16:37.002 --> 16:40.071
How refreshing.

16:40.073 --> 16:46.409
Most folks happy just to put
a sign in the yard,

16:46.411 --> 16:50.480
make an anonymous phone call.

16:50.482 --> 16:53.517
I'm not scared of you.

16:53.519 --> 16:55.422
Mm.

16:58.591 --> 17:00.060
Well, you should be.

17:02.060 --> 17:03.462
Well, I'm not.

17:05.732 --> 17:08.432
Yeah, I'll try
to remember that.

17:08.434 --> 17:11.534
I'll write it down in my diary.

17:11.536 --> 17:14.105
You have no idea who I am.

17:14.107 --> 17:16.406
No.

17:16.409 --> 17:18.678
You'll have to forgive me.
I've been gone a minute.

17:26.919 --> 17:28.588
Jody Linder.

17:30.723 --> 17:32.092
Little Jody Linder?

17:36.461 --> 17:38.696
Jody Linder.

17:38.698 --> 17:40.731
That's Hugh Jay's little girl.

17:40.733 --> 17:44.071
Goddamn.

17:51.110 --> 17:52.978
Why'd you do it?

17:54.781 --> 17:57.947
- Hm.
- I want to know the truth.

17:57.949 --> 18:00.786
You want the truth?

18:02.522 --> 18:05.692
You're in the wrong
goddamn place for that.

18:12.063 --> 18:14.098
Wrong goddamn family too.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.401
Billy.

18:18.737 --> 18:22.106
I need to know
why you did it.

18:22.108 --> 18:24.175
Why did I fucking do it?

18:24.177 --> 18:25.943
- Billy.
- Fucking murderer.

18:25.945 --> 18:27.011
Get the fuck out of my...

18:27.013 --> 18:28.212
Billy, just... Billy.

18:28.214 --> 18:30.747
Talking to me?

18:30.749 --> 18:33.149
Goddamn it.
Scared now, ain't you?

18:33.151 --> 18:35.019
- Why'd you do it?
- Fucking...

18:36.456 --> 18:38.856
Granddaddy made me
a murderer.

18:38.858 --> 18:41.559
How's that feel, huh?
How's that fucking feel?

18:41.561 --> 18:45.963
Have a murderer all with
his hands all up on you, huh?

18:45.965 --> 18:47.865
Huh?

18:47.867 --> 18:49.233
Like that?

19:04.717 --> 19:06.216
Run on home, now.

19:06.218 --> 19:08.651
Run on home 'fore you get
yourself into some trouble...

19:08.653 --> 19:11.488
in some real goddamn trouble.

19:11.490 --> 19:16.926
Run on home.

19:16.928 --> 19:18.862
You run home!

19:18.864 --> 19:21.831
You run home
and tell granddaddy

19:21.833 --> 19:25.168
all about what I did.

19:25.170 --> 19:27.571
You tell him...

19:27.573 --> 19:30.974
I meant what I said!

20:18.791 --> 20:22.829
How many people don't think
Billy killed my folks?

20:25.797 --> 20:28.933
Not many.

20:28.935 --> 20:30.935
So some people
don't think he did?

20:32.705 --> 20:33.971
I don't know.

20:33.973 --> 20:36.607
No, that's not fair.

20:36.609 --> 20:37.608
That's not fair.

20:37.610 --> 20:38.975
If I ask you how many

20:38.977 --> 20:40.077
and you say "not many,"

20:40.079 --> 20:41.781
then that means some don't.

20:43.615 --> 20:46.252
Maybe a... handful.

20:49.921 --> 20:52.222
You don't think he did it.

20:52.224 --> 20:53.991
Jail's where
Billy Croyle belongs.

20:56.128 --> 20:59.029
<i>You know something.</i>

20:59.031 --> 21:01.665
You know something
and you're not telling me.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.233
You're a Linder.
You tell me.

21:06.237 --> 21:09.072
Senior wanted Billy in jail,
and that's what he got.

21:09.074 --> 21:10.940
...sweet cheeks.

21:10.942 --> 21:12.275
- Huh? What's your name, huh?
- All right, that's enough.

21:12.277 --> 21:14.144
- You want another drink?
- You know what?

21:16.381 --> 21:18.182
But don't...
don't miss my point here.

21:18.184 --> 21:20.117
I'm...

21:20.119 --> 21:23.786
Senior did it out of
honest-to-God grief and sorrow,

21:23.788 --> 21:27.791
and... and he thought
he knew the truth.

21:27.793 --> 21:30.226
I'm gonna kill every one
of you last fucking losers!

21:30.228 --> 21:33.330
Billy, go home, goddamn it!

21:33.332 --> 21:35.366
Did my mom...

21:35.368 --> 21:38.769
leave with Billy's hat on?

21:38.771 --> 21:41.804
I don't know.
Billy, um...

21:41.806 --> 21:44.140
Did my mom leave
with Billy's hat on?

21:44.142 --> 21:45.743
Look, Billy deserved
to be in jail.

21:45.745 --> 21:47.176
You tell me what you think
happened that night!

21:47.178 --> 21:48.948
I-I don't know, I...

21:51.984 --> 21:55.284
I don't know.
I don't know.

21:55.286 --> 21:56.719
And that's
the God's honest truth.

21:56.721 --> 21:57.957
I don't, okay?

22:03.094 --> 22:05.795
Maybe you should
go ask Senior

22:05.797 --> 22:08.000
about what Doc saw that day.

22:53.211 --> 22:55.147
Hold on!

22:59.251 --> 23:01.185
Would have been
in trouble without this.

23:01.187 --> 23:03.986
Isn't she getting
just a little old for that?

23:03.988 --> 23:05.888
Aw, she gets to decide when
she doesn't need it anymore.

23:05.890 --> 23:07.858
- Give me a kiss.
- Bye.

23:07.860 --> 23:09.259
- Laurie? Laurie.
- Yeah?

23:09.261 --> 23:10.494
You two know you have
a sitter in me.

23:10.496 --> 23:13.429
Oh, sure do
appreciate the help.

23:13.431 --> 23:15.299
- You girls have fun.
- Bye, love you.

23:15.301 --> 23:18.468
- Love you.
- Bye.

24:01.781 --> 24:02.816
Hello?

24:05.150 --> 24:07.986
Yeah.
Yeah, that's good for me.

24:12.358 --> 24:14.023
Yeah, I'll bet.

24:14.025 --> 24:15.361
Okay, bye.

24:46.825 --> 24:48.827
Did Billy have a fair trial?

24:50.929 --> 24:52.431
I'm looking for the...

25:00.206 --> 25:03.176
- Here you go.
- Thank you, hon.

25:14.986 --> 25:19.022
He got a fair trial.

25:19.024 --> 25:21.390
Ah... you ask me,

25:21.392 --> 25:25.061
he's lucky folks didn't
string him up in the square.

25:26.599 --> 25:29.398
Some people think
he's innocent.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.572
The last way
I'd describe him.

25:37.642 --> 25:39.576
Bailey didn't think
he did it.

25:39.578 --> 25:42.315
Well, he's been listening to
too much damn bar gossip.

25:52.624 --> 25:57.159
He told me to ask you about
what Doc saw...

25:57.161 --> 25:59.131
the night my folks were killed.

26:02.066 --> 26:05.135
Right, well,
of course he did.

26:05.137 --> 26:08.071
Downright "Matlock" of him.

26:08.073 --> 26:10.506
If he spent as much time
trying to make a dollar

26:10.508 --> 26:13.577
as he did sticking his nose
where it don't belong,

26:13.579 --> 26:16.647
he'd be a rich man.

26:16.649 --> 26:18.115
There's not much
to tell about that.

26:18.117 --> 26:20.550
He...

26:20.552 --> 26:22.551
Doc said he saw Hugh Jay
get into it

26:22.553 --> 26:24.154
<i>with a couple toughs
from out of town.</i>

26:24.156 --> 26:25.988
<i>Said that they...</i>

26:25.990 --> 26:31.328
<i>it looked like...
could be trouble.</i>

26:31.330 --> 26:32.963
<i>Doc and I talked about it,
decided whether</i>

26:32.965 --> 26:34.164
<i>we should tell Don or not,</i>

26:34.166 --> 26:37.667
and decided
it wasn't important.

26:37.669 --> 26:40.503
Wasn't important?

26:40.505 --> 26:42.071
They weren't from
around here.

26:42.073 --> 26:43.139
They... they never could
have found his place.

26:43.141 --> 26:44.573
They wouldn't have.

26:44.575 --> 26:46.275
It would have just muddied
the whole situation

26:46.277 --> 26:48.678
if we brought that up.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.447
So you didn't
tell anyone about it?

26:51.449 --> 26:54.953
I didn't,
but it's a small town.

28:03.389 --> 28:06.590
Jody, um, you play out here
for a while, okay?

28:06.592 --> 28:09.091
- I'll see if your mom is up.
- But I'm hungry.

28:09.093 --> 28:11.194
Yeah, I know, sweetie.
We're gonna go get some.

28:11.196 --> 28:14.033
Just... play out here
for Mimi, okay?

28:30.748 --> 28:33.452
Laurie?

28:50.701 --> 28:53.305
Laurie?

29:12.157 --> 29:14.794
Laurie, are you home?

29:21.467 --> 29:24.303
Laurie?

29:39.284 --> 29:41.484
Dad.

29:41.486 --> 29:43.520
- Sweetie, no.
- Dad.

29:43.522 --> 29:45.254
Oh, my God.

29:45.256 --> 29:46.590
Oh, my God.

29:46.592 --> 29:49.227
Oh, Jesus.

30:17.156 --> 30:20.322
Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh.
Get.

30:20.324 --> 30:21.925
Get.

30:21.927 --> 30:24.793
Hup, hup, hup, hup.

30:38.377 --> 30:40.276
- Get on down there.
- Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

30:40.278 --> 30:42.244
Get on down.
Get.

30:42.246 --> 30:43.679
Come on now.
Come on.

30:43.681 --> 30:45.348
Get on down there.
Get.

30:45.350 --> 30:46.550
- Get.
- Hey, hey, hey.

30:46.552 --> 30:48.618
Get in there.
Get.

30:48.620 --> 30:49.919
- Come on, girl.
- Get your ass in there.

30:49.921 --> 30:51.554
Come on.

31:07.639 --> 31:09.705
Get!

31:09.707 --> 31:11.808
Take it easy, Billy!

31:11.810 --> 31:13.342
- Get!
- You're scaring 'em, Billy.

31:13.344 --> 31:15.244
- Come on now.
- Get on!

31:15.246 --> 31:16.879
Billy!

31:29.727 --> 31:31.528
Think long and hard
before you start talking.

31:31.530 --> 31:32.928
I wasn't doing nothing.

31:32.930 --> 31:34.763
I seen it done out here
a thousand times before

31:34.765 --> 31:35.865
- by everybody else.
- You haven't seen it

31:35.867 --> 31:37.567
done around me.

31:37.569 --> 31:39.869
You're done here.

31:39.871 --> 31:41.541
Come on, Senior.

31:43.941 --> 31:47.377
I need the work.

31:47.379 --> 31:48.880
You're done here, Billy.

31:52.650 --> 31:54.719
It's just a damn cow!

31:57.922 --> 31:59.755
I wasn't hurting it.
I was just

31:59.757 --> 32:02.591
getting it out of the way.
It was clogging up the pen.

32:02.593 --> 32:06.198
He didn't have to do me like
that in front of everybody.

32:48.806 --> 32:51.041
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:51.043 --> 32:52.574
Those boots do not
come in my house.

32:52.576 --> 32:54.346
Wouldn't think of it.

33:00.986 --> 33:03.419
- Hi.
- Hey.

33:03.421 --> 33:04.920
You all are back early.

33:07.059 --> 33:08.757
Staying for dinner?

33:08.759 --> 33:12.696
The cheese comes all
individually wrapped like that?

33:12.698 --> 33:15.831
- I was just checking my game...
- Hand it over.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.434
But...

33:17.436 --> 33:19.502
I'll check it.

33:19.504 --> 33:21.603
That was a good touch

33:21.605 --> 33:23.340
with this brown sugar
on these carrots.

33:24.909 --> 33:26.042
I like it.

33:26.044 --> 33:28.712
Mm-hmm.

33:28.714 --> 33:32.415
Makes it kind of like dessert.

33:32.417 --> 33:34.083
Don't get any ideas
and start putting sugar

33:34.085 --> 33:36.352
on everything.

34:12.456 --> 34:14.359
Goddamn son of a bitch.

34:21.699 --> 34:22.998
Red just radioed,

34:23.001 --> 34:25.501
said the fence lines
in the south got cut.

34:25.503 --> 34:26.902
I know.
I was just down there.

34:26.905 --> 34:28.838
I need you to call the sheriff.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.438
You sure you don't want me
to go over and see

34:30.440 --> 34:33.409
- if Billy was even...
- Let Don handle it.

34:33.411 --> 34:34.878
Come on, Pop.
We don't even know if...

34:34.880 --> 34:37.981
We know.
We goddamn well know.

34:37.983 --> 34:40.617
Tell him you want to be there
when he brings him in.

34:40.619 --> 34:43.553
We deserve that much.

34:43.554 --> 34:45.120
I just don't think
it's the right thing to do.

34:45.121 --> 34:47.760
At what point did you think
this was a conversation?

35:06.977 --> 35:09.678
This is bullshit, Don.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.448
How come every time
something happens,

35:11.450 --> 35:14.983
- you come looking for me?
- That what you think, Billy?

35:14.985 --> 35:17.620
Hugh Jay!

35:17.622 --> 35:21.057
Hey, look at me, man.
I didn't kill no cow.

35:21.059 --> 35:25.628
One day, somebody's gonna knock
Senior off his high horse.

35:25.630 --> 35:27.830
- Get your hands off me.
- Billy, take it easy.

35:27.832 --> 35:30.066
I'm getting in the car.

35:47.952 --> 35:51.189
So, uh...
what can I do for you?

35:57.061 --> 36:00.530
Who else would you have
looked at...

36:00.532 --> 36:02.832
if Billy didn't do it?

36:02.834 --> 36:04.901
Well, see, here's the thing.

36:04.903 --> 36:07.736
That's like asking me what I'd
do if Helen woke up one morning

36:07.738 --> 36:09.175
and stopped griping at me.

36:12.910 --> 36:15.678
Something happened
that night out on 41,

36:15.680 --> 36:18.648
the night my folks were killed.

36:18.650 --> 36:20.149
What?

36:20.151 --> 36:21.550
You know I'm not as dumb

36:21.552 --> 36:24.254
as your grandpa
thinks I am, right?

36:24.256 --> 36:26.722
Senior should have told me
everything he knew,

36:26.724 --> 36:28.925
but that don't mean
I can't do my job.

36:28.927 --> 36:31.861
That whole hullabaloo on 41,

36:31.863 --> 36:34.731
that had nothing to do
with this case.

36:34.733 --> 36:36.966
What makes you so sure?

36:36.968 --> 36:39.102
'Cause the math's off.

36:39.104 --> 36:41.570
What math?

36:41.572 --> 36:44.173
All right, look.

36:44.175 --> 36:47.577
Why do these city punks...

36:47.579 --> 36:51.280
kill your father
at your house...

36:51.282 --> 36:56.218
and take your mom over to
Frog Creek to drown her,

36:56.220 --> 36:58.555
steal her wedding ring...

36:58.557 --> 37:00.289
while they leave $200
in your dad's wallet

37:00.291 --> 37:03.626
back at the house?

37:03.628 --> 37:05.961
It don't make any sense.

37:05.963 --> 37:11.667
Pretend Billy didn't do it
or those punks, right?

37:11.669 --> 37:14.570
Who else would you look at?

37:14.572 --> 37:16.705
I know it's hard to hear,

37:16.707 --> 37:18.073
but in a case like this,

37:18.075 --> 37:21.910
I've always got
to look at family.

37:21.912 --> 37:23.579
Thank you for this food.
We ask you to bless it

37:23.581 --> 37:24.981
for our body's use.

37:24.983 --> 37:26.816
What, don't I get a hello?

37:26.818 --> 37:28.251
Provided you saved me
some bacon.

37:33.057 --> 37:35.725
- Oh, my goodness.
- There you go.

37:35.727 --> 37:37.827
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

37:37.829 --> 37:40.963
Bacon, table.
Bacon, table.

37:40.965 --> 37:42.131
Hi.

37:42.133 --> 37:43.832
No?

37:43.834 --> 37:46.035
Can I steal your orange juice?

37:48.039 --> 37:50.673
Suppose it doesn't fit you.

37:50.675 --> 37:52.709
Fits you.

37:52.711 --> 37:54.644
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

37:56.881 --> 37:59.015
I can't
stay that long, all right?

38:01.686 --> 38:03.956
- I don't know.
- Easy, now.

38:10.928 --> 38:12.394
- Good eggs.
- Tell you a fact right now,

38:12.396 --> 38:14.997
- and I'm only gonna say it once.
- All right.

38:14.999 --> 38:18.734
If you want this nice little
honeymooning thing

38:18.736 --> 38:21.104
that you got planned, you know,

38:21.106 --> 38:25.274
I'm not gonna be able to pay
for the circus that you...

38:25.276 --> 38:27.376
- Yeah.
- Are planning for a wedding.

38:27.378 --> 38:30.012
Well, now, I mean, you know,
Senior... Senior's got a point.

38:30.014 --> 38:32.881
I mean, Belle and I... I mean,
we can... we can discuss it.

38:32.883 --> 38:34.283
- We don't...
- It's not a circus.

38:34.285 --> 38:35.818
- Don't pay him attention.
- Hey, Meryl.

38:35.820 --> 38:37.285
You going to the
Grand Ole Opry tonight?

38:37.287 --> 38:40.423
You just have one daughter,
one daughter.

38:40.425 --> 38:42.158
Jealousy's unbecoming.
In fact, I believe you have

38:42.160 --> 38:46.262
- this in a powder blue yourself.
- Oh, I do, yeah.

38:46.264 --> 38:48.901
I need to see you
in my office.

38:56.874 --> 38:59.043
I need to see you
in the office.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.624
Whoa, whoa.

39:22.267 --> 39:27.704
Morning, sunshine.
Hey.

39:27.706 --> 39:29.874
Hey.

39:43.153 --> 39:46.155
Take a look at this.

39:46.157 --> 39:48.423
I need you to go to Colorado
right away.

39:48.425 --> 39:51.093
I...

39:51.095 --> 39:52.762
Now, I put you
in charge up there.

39:52.764 --> 39:54.329
I stand behind it,
but if you can't do it,

39:54.331 --> 39:55.965
- I'll ask Chase to do it.
- Dad, I don't need a lecture.

39:55.967 --> 39:59.869
This shows me different.

39:59.871 --> 40:02.707
If it's what I think it is,
fire Timmons.

40:04.374 --> 40:05.908
I'll leave it to you whether

40:05.910 --> 40:06.979
you involve
the authorities or not.

40:16.253 --> 40:18.756
You'll find it.

40:53.423 --> 40:55.825
- What...
- Hey.

40:55.827 --> 40:57.492
- Hey.
- Jody's right there.

40:57.494 --> 40:59.363
What's gotten into you?

41:08.206 --> 41:11.407
- She's right there.
- All right.

41:11.409 --> 41:13.276
- You all right?
- Yeah. I got to pack my bags.

41:13.278 --> 41:16.111
I'm heading to Flat Rock.

41:16.113 --> 41:21.283
All right.

41:21.285 --> 41:23.385
Hugh Jay, I wish you'd learn
to stand up for yourself.

41:23.387 --> 41:26.488
Laurie, can we not, okay?
Not now.

41:26.490 --> 41:28.356
I've had
a couple fucked-up days.

41:28.358 --> 41:31.394
Shh, she's right over there.

41:33.965 --> 41:36.365
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:36.367 --> 41:39.434
You think you're old enough
to be messing with this?

41:39.436 --> 41:43.305
- I was just playing around.
- Where'd you get this?

41:43.307 --> 41:44.941
Well, Chase left it here

41:44.943 --> 41:46.441
after he had
all mom's coffee this morning.

41:48.546 --> 41:51.580
What'd he want?

41:51.582 --> 41:53.149
What do you mean?

41:53.151 --> 41:55.419
He came by for coffee
after the co-op.

42:04.061 --> 42:05.396
I got to pack.

42:10.602 --> 42:12.300
Don't mind him.

42:12.302 --> 42:14.305
He's not happy about
having to go to Flat Rock.

42:25.617 --> 42:27.416
Do we need to talk
about something?

42:27.418 --> 42:29.551
What do we need
to talk about?

42:29.553 --> 42:32.387
I don't know.
You tell me.

42:32.389 --> 42:35.191
Come home like that, you
haven't touched me in a month.

42:35.193 --> 42:36.559
You tell me you're
going to Flat Rock for...

42:36.561 --> 42:38.294
- Okay.
- I don't know what.

42:38.296 --> 42:39.629
I'm going up there
to take care of business.

42:39.631 --> 42:41.329
I just told you what...
you got a problem?

42:41.331 --> 42:42.664
I-I just don't know
when you're coming or going.

42:42.666 --> 42:44.133
- I don't know...
- I don't know when

42:44.135 --> 42:45.934
you're ever happy,
'cause you know what?

42:45.936 --> 42:47.503
The truth of the matter is
I was fine as a ranch hand.

42:47.505 --> 42:49.271
You didn't have to get
all riled up about me

42:49.273 --> 42:51.274
taking over my dad's ranch.
So what is it?

42:51.276 --> 42:53.142
You want me to stay here,
or do you want me to do this?

42:53.144 --> 42:54.609
- Are you... are you insane?
- You ever look in the mirror

42:54.611 --> 42:56.278
and maybe realize
that you're the one

42:56.280 --> 42:58.414
- who's got the fucking problem?
- Are you insane?

42:58.416 --> 43:00.349
Am I insane?
Am I insane?

43:00.351 --> 43:02.050
Don't try to pin this on me.

43:02.052 --> 43:03.653
- Don't try to pin...
- Me?

43:03.655 --> 43:05.421
- Me, pin this on you?
- You'd live in any kind

43:05.423 --> 43:07.155
of life your daddy wants,
and you try to pin it on me?

43:07.157 --> 43:08.390
What about the shit that
I've been hearing around town?

43:08.392 --> 43:10.158
Having my brother
over in the morning

43:10.160 --> 43:11.359
- and not telling me about this?
- Oh, my God, are you...

43:11.361 --> 43:13.062
- keep your voice down.
- Huh?

43:13.064 --> 43:14.562
What about the shit that
I've been hearing around town?

43:14.564 --> 43:16.198
- She's down...
- Huh?

43:16.200 --> 43:17.934
- I don't...
- You want to talk about that?

43:17.936 --> 43:19.167
You've been spending too
much time in the bar.

43:19.169 --> 43:20.236
Flirting with the boys,

43:20.238 --> 43:22.939
being down at the diner?
Huh?

43:22.941 --> 43:26.075
Yeah, I've been hearing things.
You want to talk about that?

43:26.077 --> 43:27.676
You want to talk?
You want to talk right now?

43:27.678 --> 43:29.178
Maybe I should hang out
in some bars in Flat Rock,

43:29.180 --> 43:30.946
- see what I hear up there.
- You know what?

43:30.948 --> 43:33.115
It's a different story every
week, and if it was last week,

43:33.117 --> 43:35.184
it seemed like you'd be
pretty happy,

43:35.186 --> 43:37.452
me being gone most of the time.

43:37.454 --> 43:39.655
That's truth.

43:50.735 --> 43:53.137
Fuck it.

44:17.294 --> 44:19.595
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:19.597 --> 44:22.131
Thought you'd be halfway
to Flat Rock by now.

44:22.133 --> 44:24.666
Yeah, I'm on my way over.

44:24.668 --> 44:26.369
I ran into Doc Taylor,

44:26.371 --> 44:28.470
said we could bring
by the mare tonight.

44:28.472 --> 44:31.006
- All right.
- Hey, Hugh Jay.

44:31.008 --> 44:33.209
What happened to Billy?

44:33.211 --> 44:36.245
- Oh, you didn't miss much.
- He put up a fight?

44:36.247 --> 44:38.383
It's none of your damn
business, Red.

44:41.084 --> 44:42.584
Well, what the hell's
gotten into you?

44:42.586 --> 44:44.720
You don't need to talk
to Red like that.

44:44.722 --> 44:48.224
I mean, we're all fired up.
Kid's just asking questions.

44:48.226 --> 44:52.794
Yeah, kid.
"Kid" is the key word there.

44:52.796 --> 44:55.566
Now, you and Senior will get
the mare over to Doc's?

44:57.668 --> 45:01.570
- You're a dick.
- I'm a dick?

45:01.572 --> 45:03.439
You been looking for something?

45:03.441 --> 45:06.578
- Yeah, where'd you find it?
- My kitchen.

45:10.747 --> 45:13.149
Oh, yeah.

45:13.151 --> 45:15.483
Looks like you caught us.

45:15.485 --> 45:17.352
We need to talk
when I get back.

45:17.354 --> 45:19.623
Yeah, well, hopefully you're
in a better fucking mood.

46:09.506 --> 46:12.807
<i>I hate you, Collin Croyle.</i>

46:12.809 --> 46:17.245
You're the dumbest,
most stupid, mean idiot!

46:17.247 --> 46:18.814
I hate you!

46:18.816 --> 46:22.617
I hope your dad dies
in prison!

46:22.619 --> 46:24.655
I hate your whole family!

46:40.537 --> 46:43.338
Do you have the files
from the case?

46:43.340 --> 46:45.376
Uh... yeah.
Uh...

46:53.751 --> 46:56.220
Sorry, it's...
kind of messy.

47:12.637 --> 47:16.238
Do you want a...
do you want a drink, or...

47:16.240 --> 47:18.176
Uh, yeah, that...
that would be nice.

47:25.282 --> 47:26.450
Here.

47:40.865 --> 47:43.465
Do you want another?

47:43.467 --> 47:45.700
Yeah, sure.

47:45.702 --> 47:46.737
Thanks.

48:01.952 --> 48:04.555
When your dad got out...

48:13.264 --> 48:16.731
I was so wrapped up in...

48:16.733 --> 48:20.538
my own pain and hatred.

48:22.807 --> 48:24.676
I wasn't thinking
about anyone else.

48:27.711 --> 48:29.845
I don't know.
It just wasn't fair, and...

48:29.847 --> 48:32.350
and what I'm trying to say
is I'm sorry, I guess.

48:34.684 --> 48:36.320
I'm sorry.

48:38.622 --> 48:41.193
I knew you were just hurting.

48:46.396 --> 48:48.299
I've-I've always known that.

48:54.671 --> 48:58.677
The, um... the case files
are in my car.

49:24.702 --> 49:28.403
Here, look at this.

49:28.405 --> 49:30.972
It's George Timmons.

49:30.974 --> 49:32.941
He was arrested in Flat Rock

49:32.943 --> 49:36.445
for embezzling from
your grandfather's ranch

49:36.447 --> 49:40.649
just a couple weeks
after your folks were killed.

49:40.651 --> 49:44.919
Then the charges were dropped
almost immediately.

49:44.921 --> 49:47.789
I'm-I'm not saying that
the two were connected,

49:47.791 --> 49:51.827
but... it wouldn't hurt to look.

49:51.829 --> 49:56.501
<i>I mean, Don didn't do so much
as to make a call up there.</i>

49:59.903 --> 50:01.937
What do you think happened?

50:01.939 --> 50:05.310
I... I-I wish I knew.

50:07.544 --> 50:10.682
I had a lot of questions
but not a lot of answers.

50:12.682 --> 50:14.550
<i>And the people that
put Billy away</i>

50:14.552 --> 50:17.553
<i>weren't exactly
falling over themselves</i>

50:17.555 --> 50:21.023
<i>to help me build a case
on reasonable doubt.</i>

50:21.025 --> 50:23.524
I thought you told them that
you stayed up the whole night.

50:23.526 --> 50:24.892
I did.

50:24.894 --> 50:27.662
Look, I mean,
I want to make things right,

50:27.664 --> 50:31.802
but... I'm not here
to find all the answers.

50:34.572 --> 50:36.472
So you don't care about
what really happened.

50:39.843 --> 50:41.642
I mean, honestly, I think

50:41.644 --> 50:43.947
I'm the only one left
that actually does.

53:32.916 --> 53:35.149
Been looking for you.

53:35.151 --> 53:36.887
Well, here I am.

53:49.900 --> 53:53.070
I don't think Billy Croyle
killed my folks.

53:59.809 --> 54:01.813
All right.

54:04.081 --> 54:06.017
That's all you're gonna say?

54:11.121 --> 54:13.921
I-I...

54:13.923 --> 54:17.262
I mean, what...
what am I supposed to say?

54:18.963 --> 54:20.865
I thought you'd tell me
I was wrong.

54:25.635 --> 54:27.304
That ain't gonna
bring them back.

54:31.140 --> 54:32.608
I wish I could have met

54:32.610 --> 54:35.246
the Chase Linder
everyone talks about...

54:37.981 --> 54:40.284
New woman
on his arm every week.

54:45.689 --> 54:49.725
Been hearing some stories,
haven't you?

54:49.727 --> 54:55.196
If I asked you
about my mom...

54:55.198 --> 54:57.001
would you tell me the truth?

55:00.637 --> 55:05.108
Not about how pretty she was
or... that she couldn't cook.

55:06.943 --> 55:09.346
I can't help the memories
that I can keep.

55:13.983 --> 55:15.719
Was she fucking someone?

55:19.923 --> 55:22.323
What?

55:22.325 --> 55:24.028
Was she fucking you?

55:31.968 --> 55:34.805
Are you mourning her or my dad?

56:19.182 --> 56:22.350
What is that on your shirt?
Is that a bumblebee?

56:22.352 --> 56:24.151
What?
Uh...

56:24.153 --> 56:25.754
I think it's a little
more abstract.

56:25.756 --> 56:26.921
- It's, like, artistic.
- Where the hell

56:26.923 --> 56:28.756
did you find... artistic?

56:28.758 --> 56:30.492
Those are little, tiny
bumblebees on a grown-ass man.

56:30.494 --> 56:32.794
Bumblebees.

56:32.796 --> 56:35.731
- I think it's just a design.
- Looks like a baby's bib.

56:35.733 --> 56:37.733
Hey, you're on me tonight.
Hey.

56:37.735 --> 56:39.934
Y'all got room
for a thirsty cowboy?

56:39.936 --> 56:42.137
- Always.
- All right.

56:42.139 --> 56:43.939
Don't you have
any other friends?

56:43.941 --> 56:45.740
Yeah, but I ain't drunk
enough to stand them yet.

56:45.742 --> 56:47.108
You're just gonna have
to bear my company for a bit.

56:47.110 --> 56:48.209
You all pouring these
on the floor?

56:48.211 --> 56:49.410
Got to stay in your family.

56:49.412 --> 56:50.778
- Hey.
- Let's do another round.

56:50.780 --> 56:51.979
- Another round?
- Whiskey.

56:51.981 --> 56:53.215
- Whiskey?
- Whiskey?

56:53.217 --> 56:54.783
Yeah.

56:54.785 --> 56:55.883
You're certain
you want whiskey?

56:55.885 --> 56:57.986
Yeah, one more.

56:57.988 --> 57:01.289
- Belle wants a whiskey.
- It's spring break over here.

57:01.291 --> 57:03.057
I say... I...

57:03.059 --> 57:04.425
I'll make sure
you feel included.

57:04.427 --> 57:06.961
All right.
That's very kind of you.

57:06.963 --> 57:08.363
Well, you're
such a small thing,

57:08.365 --> 57:11.432
make sure you're not
doing yourself in too quick.

57:11.434 --> 57:13.267
- I'm fine.
- All right, you guys.

57:13.269 --> 57:14.369
I'm fine.
I'm just asking.

57:14.371 --> 57:16.006
Mm-hmm.

57:25.182 --> 57:28.019
All right.

57:42.800 --> 57:44.231
All r...

57:44.233 --> 57:45.934
Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

57:45.936 --> 57:48.303
no, they just
came back on here too.

57:48.305 --> 57:51.006
Yeah. All right,
I-I'll t... I'll tell them.

57:51.008 --> 57:53.010
I promise.
I'll talk to you later.

58:05.088 --> 58:06.921
Hey, your dad called.

58:06.923 --> 58:09.591
Highway's washed out at 41
up there at the Frog Creek.

58:09.593 --> 58:12.093
So he's got a room over here
at the Pollard Inn,

58:12.095 --> 58:13.528
and he got you a room,

58:13.530 --> 58:15.430
and he said you're
staying at Laurie's.

58:15.432 --> 58:17.999
I'll stay where I want.

58:18.001 --> 58:19.533
That's what he figured.
He told me to tell you

58:19.535 --> 58:23.838
specifically that she is
not staying at your place.

58:23.840 --> 58:25.307
- All right.
- Ooh.

58:25.309 --> 58:27.274
Well, then we'll both
just stay at the shop.

58:27.276 --> 58:28.577
Yeah, that's right.
You go ahead

58:28.579 --> 58:30.912
and show dad who's boss.

58:30.914 --> 58:32.479
No, I'm serious.

58:32.481 --> 58:34.282
It's good you find
your spine and everything.

58:34.284 --> 58:37.084
I'm gonna take
a couple six packs.

58:37.086 --> 58:38.887
Drink your beer, Chase.

58:38.889 --> 58:41.289
I think we're just born
into the wrong family.

58:41.291 --> 58:43.225
- Mm-hmm.
- Seemed like the right family

58:43.227 --> 58:45.492
when you was cutting that grand
opening ribbon to your shop.

58:45.494 --> 58:49.129
- Oh, shh, shh.
- Whoa.

58:49.131 --> 58:51.032
It's not funny.

58:51.034 --> 58:54.970
If you'll excuse me.

58:54.972 --> 58:56.470
Now you got me in trouble.

58:58.941 --> 59:00.642
I'm sorry.

59:00.644 --> 59:02.878
I don't know what
your problem with her is.

59:02.880 --> 59:04.445
Oh, come on.
You can't tell me

59:04.447 --> 59:06.381
your whole act
don't run you, slick.

59:06.383 --> 59:08.515
I think you ought
to consider what it's like

59:08.517 --> 59:10.921
not to be one
of the Linder boys.

59:46.923 --> 59:48.523
You gotta stop him
in his tracks.

59:48.525 --> 59:51.292
He was just trying to get
a rise out of you, and...

59:51.294 --> 59:53.128
I'm gonna get back out there,

59:53.130 --> 59:54.695
and I'm gonna get on his ass.

59:54.697 --> 59:57.365
I'm just gonna kick his ass.

59:57.367 --> 59:59.533
How are you gonna
kick his ass?

59:59.535 --> 01:00:01.269
- I'm so tired of...
- You got to try this.

01:00:01.271 --> 01:00:03.305
- I just got it.
- I'm stronger than I look.

01:00:03.307 --> 01:00:04.972
- Oh, no.
- This is power lipstick.

01:00:04.974 --> 01:00:07.041
- That's really not...
- No, you gotta...

01:00:07.043 --> 01:00:08.510
- It's really not me.
- You're gonna kick his ass

01:00:08.512 --> 01:00:10.111
- in this lipstick.
- No.

01:00:10.113 --> 01:00:12.046
You know, Meryl doesn't
really go for all that.

01:00:12.048 --> 01:00:14.082
Meryl?
No.

01:00:14.084 --> 01:00:16.517
See, makeup is not about men.

01:00:16.519 --> 01:00:19.120
Makeup is-is for you.

01:00:19.122 --> 01:00:21.256
Like, the only thing
that matters

01:00:21.258 --> 01:00:25.392
is that you feel pretty.

01:00:25.394 --> 01:00:27.562
What?

01:01:07.303 --> 01:01:09.470
Well, well, goddamn well.

01:01:09.472 --> 01:01:13.140
Here we all are, together.
Where's my chair?

01:01:13.142 --> 01:01:15.109
Fuck!

01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:17.611
Here we go.

01:01:17.613 --> 01:01:19.180
Hey, family.

01:01:19.182 --> 01:01:21.682
How we doing?
Huh?

01:01:21.684 --> 01:01:24.218
We got the homely
Holly Hobbie over here,

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.620
the fucking fake-ass
faggot cowboy.

01:01:26.622 --> 01:01:30.425
You ain't never gonna be...
you're just the same as me.

01:01:30.427 --> 01:01:32.494
- You from the same goddamn...
- You're right.

01:01:32.496 --> 01:01:34.028
- Side of the tracks as me.
- You're right.

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:35.497
You're absolutely right,
but this is not

01:01:35.499 --> 01:01:37.465
- the time or the place.
- But no, he went

01:01:37.467 --> 01:01:39.267
- to law school, and this one...
- Something going on over here?

01:01:39.269 --> 01:01:41.336
- Yeah, yeah, he's just drunk.
- What about this one?

01:01:41.338 --> 01:01:44.539
Hey, set me up.
Four more of these on his tab.

01:01:44.541 --> 01:01:46.341
- He's rich.
- That's a great idea.

01:01:46.343 --> 01:01:47.809
- You think that's a great idea?
- Sorry, man.

01:01:47.811 --> 01:01:49.644
- We're all right.
- Oh, we just funning.

01:01:49.646 --> 01:01:51.245
We were just getting ready
to leave.

01:01:51.247 --> 01:01:53.148
- We just funning!
- We're getting ready

01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:56.050
- to leave, right?
- We are just funning!

01:02:19.608 --> 01:02:21.108
Why don't you all keep on
drinking,

01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:22.609
- and we'll keep pouring?
- Yeah!

01:02:25.381 --> 01:02:27.548
All right.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:30.184
All right!
Damn...

01:02:33.557 --> 01:02:35.856
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:02:35.858 --> 01:02:37.727
Look at us, the sober ones.

01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:44.298
Mm, you are terrible.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.200
Mm-hmm.

01:02:46.202 --> 01:02:48.669
Jesus, did you not get
the heat fixed in here?

01:02:48.671 --> 01:02:51.238
We got enough heat
right here.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.408
- Come on, now.
- Meryl.

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:54.809
- Baby.
- Oh, you want to go

01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:56.276
- to the couch?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:56.278 --> 01:02:58.312
All right,
let's go to the couch.

01:02:58.314 --> 01:03:00.615
I'm gonna put this heat
back there.

01:03:00.617 --> 01:03:02.216
- Hey, gimme that...
- ...any wood back there?

01:03:02.218 --> 01:03:03.484
Sit.
You need to sit.

01:03:03.486 --> 01:03:05.753
- You just need to relax.
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:05.755 --> 01:03:07.421
- Just sit.
- Let me put a blanket down.

01:03:07.423 --> 01:03:08.789
- Meryl!
- Just let me put

01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:10.524
- a blanket down.
- You are so uptight.

01:03:10.526 --> 01:03:12.227
- I'm not uptight, baby.
- Baby.

01:03:12.229 --> 01:03:13.827
- Just give me a second.
- Come here.

01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:16.463
Baby, come on.

01:03:16.465 --> 01:03:19.367
Come on, Meryl.
Are you gonna lay down with me?

01:03:19.369 --> 01:03:21.401
Wood back there, maybe?

01:03:21.403 --> 01:03:23.137
Do you got
any wood down there?

01:03:23.139 --> 01:03:24.472
Here... oh, yeah,
you know where it is.

01:03:24.474 --> 01:03:27.408
- Come on.
- Did you get that?

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:29.510
- This is just hysterical.
- I know.

01:03:29.512 --> 01:03:31.845
Well, maybe to you,
but I'm not gonna cross Senior.

01:03:31.847 --> 01:03:34.249
Come here, come here,
come here.

01:03:34.251 --> 01:03:37.584
I'm feeling very cuddly.

01:03:37.586 --> 01:03:40.320
I know the evidence,
and I know the holes:

01:03:40.322 --> 01:03:43.457
the guys at the gas station...

01:03:43.459 --> 01:03:45.595
money missing at Flat Rock.

01:03:48.331 --> 01:03:52.233
I know my mom
was sleeping around.

01:03:52.235 --> 01:03:55.937
<i>People thought
it was Chase too.</i>

01:03:55.939 --> 01:03:59.673
<i>I'm not saying he did it.</i>

01:03:59.675 --> 01:04:02.242
Anyone could have.

01:04:02.244 --> 01:04:07.916
But you, with your...
infinite wisdom...

01:04:07.918 --> 01:04:12.620
had to sweep
it all away, didn't you?

01:04:12.622 --> 01:04:16.658
That's what you discovered
in your detective work?

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.861
You got to be careful, Jody.

01:04:19.863 --> 01:04:22.265
<i>Chase didn't kill his brother.</i>

01:04:24.501 --> 01:04:26.501
<i>He couldn't do it.</i>

01:04:26.503 --> 01:04:28.769
<i>He didn't do it.</i>

01:05:01.671 --> 01:05:05.539
Oh, I run a blue streak
when I'm cold.

01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:07.975
Whew!

01:05:07.977 --> 01:05:09.876
Oh.

01:05:14.985 --> 01:05:19.419
Oh.
The sky is falling.

01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:22.856
We made it.

01:05:22.858 --> 01:05:24.694
We made it.

01:05:27.564 --> 01:05:29.631
Hey.

01:05:29.633 --> 01:05:31.733
Hey, uh, are you sure

01:05:31.735 --> 01:05:33.734
you're gonna be all right
tonight on your own?

01:05:33.736 --> 01:05:36.937
Mm-mm.

01:05:36.939 --> 01:05:38.705
No.

01:05:38.707 --> 01:05:41.943
Afraid of thunderstorms.

01:05:41.945 --> 01:05:45.012
Oh.

01:05:45.014 --> 01:05:47.650
I don't know what
I'm gonna do on my own.

01:05:49.552 --> 01:05:50.852
Is Laurie drunk?

01:05:50.854 --> 01:05:51.919
I think Laurie's
a little bit drunk.

01:05:53.923 --> 01:05:55.455
I might be drunk.

01:05:55.457 --> 01:05:57.658
Yeah.

01:06:06.369 --> 01:06:08.369
Oh, that-that...
that ain't...

01:06:08.371 --> 01:06:11.606
- that ain't a good idea.
- What's not a good idea?

01:06:11.608 --> 01:06:14.477
That is not a good idea.

01:06:27.657 --> 01:06:29.959
Well, you know
it's not fair to...

01:06:37.334 --> 01:06:40.867
I should get going.

01:06:40.869 --> 01:06:45.041
- I should get going.
- Yeah, you should go.

01:07:22.412 --> 01:07:24.812
How about a kiss?

01:07:24.814 --> 01:07:29.483
Think I could get one of those
without anyone seeing?

01:07:29.485 --> 01:07:32.387
Hate for anyone to think
we're a thing or nothing...

01:07:32.389 --> 01:07:34.722
or something.

01:07:34.724 --> 01:07:37.026
I have a question for you.

01:07:40.463 --> 01:07:42.597
Shoot.

01:07:42.599 --> 01:07:45.399
You were with Billy
that night.

01:07:45.401 --> 01:07:47.834
<i>Was he too drunk
to leave the house?</i>

01:07:53.476 --> 01:07:55.876
Shit, I don't know.

01:07:55.878 --> 01:07:57.644
<i>All I remember
is being so tired,</i>

01:07:57.646 --> 01:07:59.717
<i>I fell on that couch,
and I was out cold.</i>

01:08:02.852 --> 01:08:03.984
Is that it?

01:08:06.956 --> 01:08:09.090
That's it.
I mean...

01:08:09.092 --> 01:08:10.758
I remember Val
telling me

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.526
I couldn't drive home,
and that boy of theirs

01:08:12.528 --> 01:08:14.796
was sitting on the floor

01:08:14.798 --> 01:08:16.631
<i>and... just watching me
like a hawk.</i>

01:08:16.633 --> 01:08:18.166
Police!
Everyone on the ground!

01:08:18.167 --> 01:08:20.533
- On the ground!
- <i>Other than that, I was out.</i>

01:08:22.104 --> 01:08:24.970
- Collin... where's my boy?
- We're bringing him to you.

01:08:24.973 --> 01:08:27.073
Keep your hands up.

01:08:27.076 --> 01:08:28.443
I didn't kill no cow!

01:08:28.444 --> 01:08:29.542
It ain't about
no fucking cows.

01:08:29.545 --> 01:08:30.810
Get him out of here.

01:08:30.813 --> 01:08:32.113
What the hell?
Hey!

01:08:32.115 --> 01:08:34.585
- Hands behind your back.
- What the hell?

01:09:14.991 --> 01:09:18.158
Huh.

01:09:18.161 --> 01:09:21.495
Huh.

01:09:21.497 --> 01:09:26.934
Chase Linder... drinking
in the middle of the day.

01:09:26.935 --> 01:09:29.439
What would your dear
brother say?

01:09:40.517 --> 01:09:42.582
What would he say?

01:09:50.893 --> 01:09:54.761
Ooh, ooh.

01:09:54.763 --> 01:09:57.200
Can't nobody take a joke
in this bar.

01:10:02.539 --> 01:10:05.041
Take my business elsewhere.

01:10:32.168 --> 01:10:34.668
<i>Hey, hand it over.</i>

01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:36.303
<i>But I was just checking...</i>

01:10:36.305 --> 01:10:38.709
<i>I'll check it.</i>

01:10:40.175 --> 01:10:45.613
Okay?
Little lady.

01:10:45.615 --> 01:10:47.347
Oh, she gets to decide when
she doesn't need it anymore.

01:10:47.349 --> 01:10:49.216
- Give me a kiss.
- Bye.

01:10:49.218 --> 01:10:51.252
<i>Laurie? Laurie.</i>

01:10:54.256 --> 01:10:56.157
Think we'll have to go
to the storm cellar?

01:10:56.159 --> 01:10:57.891
I hope not.

01:11:06.201 --> 01:11:08.069
<i>That's Chase's room.</i>

01:11:08.071 --> 01:11:10.070
<i>I want you to go down there
and wake him up.</i>

01:11:12.674 --> 01:11:13.940
Wake up.

01:11:13.942 --> 01:11:16.110
Hey.

01:11:19.915 --> 01:11:23.284
How you doing?

01:11:23.286 --> 01:11:25.151
We're going to breakfast.
What, are you crazy?

01:11:25.153 --> 01:11:28.655
- Where's Belle?
- All right, she's down there.

01:11:35.798 --> 01:11:38.666
Well, there's the best
little alarm clock

01:11:38.668 --> 01:11:40.200
I ever seen.

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:57.752
You think your mama's
still sleeping?

01:11:57.754 --> 01:12:00.657
Yeah.
You know your mama.

01:12:10.767 --> 01:12:14.368
- Dad?
- Oh, my God.

01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:17.073
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:13:17.767 --> 01:13:22.035
What happened?
Val?

01:13:24.941 --> 01:13:27.074
Son of a bitch!

01:13:30.245 --> 01:13:33.748
What happened?
Baby? Baby?

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:35.382
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:13:35.384 --> 01:13:39.453
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

01:14:20.162 --> 01:14:22.128
I got it.
Officer, I got it.

01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:23.297
I got it.
I got it.

01:14:23.299 --> 01:14:24.965
Collin, I need you stand back.

01:14:24.967 --> 01:14:26.367
- Collin, stand back.
- What... what did he do?

01:14:26.369 --> 01:14:28.569
What did he do?
What the...

01:14:28.571 --> 01:14:32.038
- What the hell's going on?
- Collin, Where's your dad?

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.373
What did he do?
What did he do?

01:14:33.375 --> 01:14:34.542
- Tell me.
- Where's he going?

01:14:34.544 --> 01:14:36.079
What did he do?

01:15:49.317 --> 01:15:51.921
Red?

01:16:01.162 --> 01:16:03.567
Red?

01:16:11.206 --> 01:16:13.274
Oh, my God.

01:16:13.276 --> 01:16:14.608
Red?

01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:16.342
Red, no.
No, come on.

01:16:16.344 --> 01:16:18.979
Wake up.

01:16:18.981 --> 01:16:20.280
No, come on.
You're gonna be fine.

01:16:20.282 --> 01:16:22.548
Come on.

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:25.019
Come on.
Red, come on.

01:16:25.021 --> 01:16:27.087
Yoo-hoo.

01:16:27.089 --> 01:16:28.457
Peek-a-boo.

01:16:41.937 --> 01:16:45.038
You fucking killed him!
You fucking killed him!

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.175
What?
What the fuck you saying, huh?

01:16:48.177 --> 01:16:49.709
Red is not dead.

01:16:49.711 --> 01:16:53.012
Red is sleeping
'cause I needed Red's gun.

01:16:57.186 --> 01:16:59.386
- Get the fuck off me.
- What?

01:16:59.388 --> 01:17:01.454
Get the fuck off me!

01:17:01.456 --> 01:17:03.324
You got
a smart fucking mouth.

01:17:03.326 --> 01:17:06.360
You know, I'm getting tired
of your goddamn...

01:17:06.362 --> 01:17:08.194
If you're gonna fucking
kill me, do it.

01:17:08.196 --> 01:17:09.562
Fucking kill me.
Do it!

01:17:09.564 --> 01:17:13.233
Oh, not yet, huh?
Huh?

01:17:13.235 --> 01:17:15.002
And I ain't going back
to Leavenworth

01:17:15.004 --> 01:17:16.337
without a little payback.

01:17:16.339 --> 01:17:18.972
Oh, no, granddaddy.

01:17:18.974 --> 01:17:21.708
All right, stand.

01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:23.510
Stand.
All right.

01:17:23.512 --> 01:17:26.579
Ow! Walk.
Goddamn it.

01:17:26.581 --> 01:17:29.018
- Fuck you.
- Come on, bitch.

01:17:36.692 --> 01:17:38.695
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:17:42.164 --> 01:17:43.663
Don't you fucking
look at me like that.

01:17:43.665 --> 01:17:47.400
Put this in your...

01:17:47.402 --> 01:17:49.569
Come here, huh?
Put it in your goddamn mouth.

01:17:49.571 --> 01:17:51.372
Huh, huh, huh?
That's what you get

01:17:51.374 --> 01:17:53.276
if you don't play nice.

01:18:41.456 --> 01:18:44.660
I'll picture you
when I burn this house.

01:19:17.425 --> 01:19:20.560
It's Billy!
It's Billy!

01:19:26.235 --> 01:19:30.471
Jody?

01:19:30.473 --> 01:19:33.407
Jody?
Jody?

01:19:33.409 --> 01:19:37.179
Hey, old man.

01:19:54.263 --> 01:19:57.730
- Get off him, you little cunt.
- Leave her alone!

01:19:57.732 --> 01:20:02.269
- It's between you and me!
- Look at me!

01:20:02.271 --> 01:20:06.308
You did this to me,
you piece of shit!

01:20:10.812 --> 01:20:13.747
Billy!

01:20:13.749 --> 01:20:17.417
Watch your head explode
right before your very eyes

01:20:17.419 --> 01:20:21.622
like a goddamn magic trick,
like putting somebody away

01:20:21.624 --> 01:20:25.859
for 12 years for something
they didn't fucking do!

01:20:25.861 --> 01:20:31.431
Get out of here, Jody!

01:20:42.277 --> 01:20:44.546
You okay?
Shh.

01:20:46.314 --> 01:20:49.516
Hey, hey, shh.

01:21:18.513 --> 01:21:22.481
It's gonna be okay,
all right?

01:21:22.483 --> 01:21:24.454
It's fine.
Just keep breathing.

01:21:29.825 --> 01:21:31.358
Don't you leave me!

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.392
Don't you dare leave me!

01:21:33.394 --> 01:21:35.761
- Don't you dare!
- Ma'am...

01:21:44.305 --> 01:21:49.309
Hey.
I'm staying.

01:21:49.311 --> 01:21:52.678
Okay... okay.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.981
All right.

01:21:54.983 --> 01:21:57.653
Let's get you looked at
too, all right?

01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:45.498

I'm gonna get going.

01:22:49.304 --> 01:22:51.904

- You don't need to apologize

01:23:36.919 --> 01:23:40.921
for nothing.
Don't do that, okay?

01:23:40.923 --> 01:23:44.056
You're family.

01:23:44.058 --> 01:23:46.525
Hey, Mom.

01:23:46.527 --> 01:23:48.528
How you holding up?

01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:49.564
Huh?

01:23:51.767 --> 01:23:53.533
When was the last time
someone was out here?

01:23:53.535 --> 01:23:55.001
I don't know.

01:23:55.003 --> 01:23:58.704
- What time is it?
- It's been a while.

01:23:58.706 --> 01:24:00.940
All right, I'm gonna go
find somebody, okay?

01:24:00.942 --> 01:24:02.344
Yeah.

01:27:09.798 --> 01:27:12.666
- I drank too much gin.
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:12.668 --> 01:27:16.936
- That'll pass too.
- All right.

01:27:16.938 --> 01:27:19.605
- You're gonna sleep right here?
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:19.607 --> 01:27:21.910
You promise?

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:30.150
Promise me, right?

01:27:30.152 --> 01:27:32.188
Okay.

We have... we have to go.

What are you do...

01:31:53.514 --> 01:31:55.215
It's all right.

01:31:55.217 --> 01:31:57.152
It's all right.

01:32:04.291 --> 01:32:07.392
Just get dressed.

01:32:18.272 --> 01:32:20.974

01:32:49.271 --> 01:32:50.602
No! No!

01:32:50.604 --> 01:32:52.605
I can tell them

01:32:52.607 --> 01:32:55.007
He just come home, and I was

01:32:55.009 --> 01:32:56.208

01:33:14.195 --> 01:33:16.261
But we have to go get Jody.

01:33:20.402 --> 01:33:24.270

Morning.

01:34:31.705 --> 01:34:33.439
We're going to breakfast.

01:34:33.441 --> 01:34:35.374
What are you, crazy?

01:34:53.495 --> 01:34:55.160
Yup.

A little bit of rain.
