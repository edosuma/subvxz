09:41.960 --> 09:43.000
You're right.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I'm gonna tell Mom and Dad

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm sleeping with them.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.290
No, no, no, no, no.

09:46.290 --> 09:47.670
Then I can't go to
my thing tomorrow night.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.750
Ugh.

09:48.750 --> 09:49.960
I can fix this.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.420
If I can scare you that fast,

09:51.420 --> 09:52.920
I can cure you that fast.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.920
I hope so,
'cause now there's

09:54.920 --> 09:56.500
two things
that terrify me:

09:56.500 --> 09:59.040
The dark, and you rapping.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.580
Ugh! How can I
get out of this?

10:05.580 --> 10:07.080
Seven kids, and not
one of you has to go

10:07.080 --> 10:09.080
to the hospital
right now?

10:09.080 --> 10:10.330
Ethan, I'll give you
100 bucks

10:10.330 --> 10:11.960
if you break
a finger or a toe.

10:11.960 --> 10:16.540
Ahh. There's that Suzy-style
parenting we all know, love,

10:16.540 --> 10:18.000
and swallow
our comments about.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.250
I think that one
got away from you.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.710
As vice chairperson
of the Marshport
Seafood Festival,

10:23.710 --> 10:26.920
it's my duty to check on
our wild card volunteers.

10:26.920 --> 10:30.540
I made ten pots
of bass last night.

10:30.540 --> 10:33.080
And I trust you used
organic potatoes?

10:33.080 --> 10:35.920
Of course...

10:35.920 --> 10:38.830
Now I'm off to the store
for unrelated reasons.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.830
Miss Peters, great news.

10:42.830 --> 10:44.210
My new band's
available to play

10:44.210 --> 10:45.960
at the festival
on the pier.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.120
I mean, it's right
outside my dad's store,

10:48.120 --> 10:50.960
so we could even do
some overflow seating
at the deli counter.

10:50.960 --> 10:55.120
Oh, as delightful
as ham-adjacent
seating sounds,

10:55.120 --> 10:56.250
the entertainment's
all booked.

10:56.250 --> 10:57.750
Uh, come on.

10:57.750 --> 11:00.920
Haven't you ever
had a dream?

11:00.920 --> 11:05.000
Playing in front of a crowd,
fans cheering your name.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.380
[chanting]
Miss Peters! Miss Peters!

11:08.380 --> 11:11.170
I know you're a music lover.
I've heard you practice violin

11:11.170 --> 11:12.960
-through your window.
-Well, it's a viola.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.170
There's no wretched,
high E string. [scoffs]

11:15.170 --> 11:17.120
They are the worst.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.040
E strings? Boo.

11:19.040 --> 11:22.960
You know what?
I will play in the band.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.420
Band? What band?

11:25.420 --> 11:26.420
My band?

11:29.040 --> 11:30.620
Are you ready to rock?

11:33.920 --> 11:35.170
Hey, man. A word?

11:38.960 --> 11:40.830
Isn't the band
getting a little--

11:40.830 --> 11:42.000
Large?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.170
I was going to say weird...

11:47.000 --> 11:49.210
and old.

11:49.210 --> 11:51.170
Santa's weird and old.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.170
Everyone loves him.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.620
Look, just give 'em
a chance.

11:55.620 --> 11:57.540
We haven't even
heard 'em play.

11:57.540 --> 11:58.620
[clears throat]

11:58.620 --> 12:00.120
Miss Peters?

12:03.880 --> 12:05.460
[clears throat]

12:05.460 --> 12:07.830
[playing rock riffs]

12:24.670 --> 12:26.000
Does anyone want
to hear some Nirvana,

12:26.000 --> 12:27.250
or will that suffice?

12:28.420 --> 12:30.880
I'll make an exception.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.790
All right.
Dad, showtime.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.830
[playing simple tune]

12:43.580 --> 12:45.880
[chuckles]

12:45.880 --> 12:48.040
I haven't had
the old keyboard
out in a while.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.420
And I hate to lean on this,

12:49.420 --> 12:51.210
but just till I get
my "C" legs--

12:51.210 --> 12:54.920
[preset beat playing]

12:54.920 --> 12:57.040
[discordant playing]

12:58.620 --> 13:00.170
Better, right?

13:03.670 --> 13:05.120
[sighs]

13:05.120 --> 13:07.540
We're back
to the scientific process.

13:07.540 --> 13:10.330
Curing phobias can be solved
with one simple "D".

13:10.330 --> 13:12.920
"Desensitize"

13:12.920 --> 13:16.460
OK, this box will gradually
get you used to the dark.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.290
It's a little something
I like to call,

13:18.290 --> 13:20.080
"A dip in the darkness."

13:20.080 --> 13:24.290
It's a little something I like
to call, "not gonna happen."

13:24.290 --> 13:25.420
[rapping] Then I'mma
do something

13:25.420 --> 13:27.040
that scares ya most,

13:27.040 --> 13:29.540
Hey, everybody,
it's the rapping ghost!

13:29.540 --> 13:30.710
Clingety-clang-clang.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.120
Box!
I'll take the box.

13:34.250 --> 13:37.120
[chuckles]
OK, here you go.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.250
-You okay in there?
-I think so.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.670
See? Nothing
to be afraid of.

13:47.670 --> 13:49.920
Aah! Unh!
[grunting]

13:51.250 --> 13:54.290
[grunting viciously]

13:57.120 --> 13:58.710
Aah!

14:01.040 --> 14:04.210
Well, now the box is
definitely afraid of you.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.540
Here's a new "D":
"Defense."

14:10.540 --> 14:13.000
This spray,
utilizing cutting edge

14:13.000 --> 14:15.080
anti-monster biochemistry,

14:15.080 --> 14:16.330
is guaranteed to ward off

14:16.330 --> 14:18.250
anything that goes
bump in the night.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.120
[sniffing]
That smells like

14:23.120 --> 14:25.210
the air freshener
from the bathroom.

14:25.210 --> 14:27.710
Have you ever
seen a monster
in the bathroom?

14:27.710 --> 14:31.620
Not because of the spray--
Seven kids use that thing.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.750
Even a monster
would be afraid to go in.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.580
Mom, you know how Dad said

14:41.580 --> 14:43.040
he was in a band
in high school?

14:43.040 --> 14:44.750
He was in three.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.250
His talent really never
matched his enthusiasm.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.290
Each one kicked him out
after the first show.

14:49.290 --> 14:52.790
Well, the modern world
works a little faster.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.380
It's him or us.

15:00.380 --> 15:03.120
I can't cut my dad
from the band.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.500
You must, E-man.
The integrity

15:05.500 --> 15:08.120
of the Marshport
Seafood Festival
demands it.

15:09.420 --> 15:12.620
I need to figure out a way
to let Dad down easy.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.920
This is my dream.
I-- I can't let it slip away.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.460
He'll understand, right?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.330
Guess who found
his old gig-gloves.

15:32.250 --> 15:33.620
[sharply exhales]

15:34.540 --> 15:36.210
[groans]

15:36.210 --> 15:38.330
I've tried everything.

15:38.330 --> 15:41.290
The only way she can sleep
is with me right here.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.420
What if I have to
sleep with Daphne

15:44.420 --> 15:45.920
for the rest
of my life?

15:45.920 --> 15:47.460
Stay with her at every turn?

15:47.460 --> 15:51.290
[gasps] What if
I'm the new Deathne?

15:54.460 --> 15:56.710
No offense, girl.
You do you.

16:07.170 --> 16:09.120
Thanks to you
watching for monsters,

16:09.120 --> 16:10.460
I got a great
night's sleep.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.460
Come on, Deathne.

16:11.460 --> 16:12.500
Let's get
some breakfast.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.290
[sighs] Don't call me Deathne.

16:14.290 --> 16:16.330
Don't flatter yourself.

16:16.330 --> 16:19.080
I was talking to her.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.500
Ow. Ow!

16:21.500 --> 16:22.250
Ow!

16:26.880 --> 16:29.790
Two nights of this.

16:29.790 --> 16:31.290
Turns out everything they say

16:31.290 --> 16:33.380
about sleep being important--

16:33.380 --> 16:35.500
Yeah, that's true.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.960
[sighs]
I can't fix this.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.120
Gonna have to tell Mom
I traumatized Daphne.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.290
[sighs]

16:45.830 --> 16:47.710
Better get out there quick

16:47.710 --> 16:50.710
if you want a cup
of Suzy's famous
homemade chowder.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.880
I was lucky to get this,
and I'm Suzy.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.460
I wish I had an appetite.

16:54.460 --> 16:57.670
I have to tell Dad he's about
to start his solo career.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.250
[Tom] Hey-o!

17:06.460 --> 17:08.790
I'll go get him some
cheer-up chowder.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.120
I found my lucky
show sunglasses.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.210
Ah!

17:18.620 --> 17:20.120
Dad, we have to talk.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.120
Can you take those off?

17:23.120 --> 17:25.420
I'm having a hard time
looking myself in the eye.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.500
Remember when I
didn't make the
little league team,

17:32.500 --> 17:35.000
and you made me
feel better
by telling me

17:35.000 --> 17:36.540
music was my baseball?

17:36.540 --> 17:37.790
Yeah.

17:37.790 --> 17:42.330
Well, what if your music...

17:42.330 --> 17:44.290
is bait and tackle supplies?

17:46.210 --> 17:47.540
What I'm trying
to say is--

17:47.540 --> 17:49.830
I've heard this speech enough

17:49.830 --> 17:51.460
to know where this is going.

17:51.460 --> 17:54.000
Uh, I'm not good enough
to be in your band.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.750
I knew it. Just didn't want
to say anything 'cause--

17:57.750 --> 18:00.250
I was enjoying
spending time with you.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.250
I'm gonna--

18:04.250 --> 18:08.040
[chuckles]
Let's just, uh--

18:08.040 --> 18:09.500
You know what?
I'm gonna go get a scissor.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.540
No, Dad--

18:14.540 --> 18:18.290
Those guys aren't
good enough for us.

18:18.290 --> 18:19.960
The bandana stays,
and so do you.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.290
Really?

18:21.290 --> 18:23.210
Father, son?

18:23.210 --> 18:24.960
That's a thing
people want to see.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.120
Father, son,
Miss Peters,

18:28.120 --> 18:30.330
a bunch of musical
prodigies?

18:30.330 --> 18:31.330
Dime a dozen.

18:31.330 --> 18:33.330
[laughing]

18:37.420 --> 18:40.830
Who wants some
cheer-up chowder?

18:40.830 --> 18:42.920
No need, Mom.

18:42.920 --> 18:46.540
Come on, Dad.
Let's go out there and play.

18:46.540 --> 18:47.580
You and me, and--

18:47.580 --> 18:50.080
in front of
all my friends.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.210
Just like I've
always dreamed.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.460
The festival's
been shut down.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.580
There's an outbreak
of food poisoning.

18:58.580 --> 18:59.960
It's the chowder.

19:03.540 --> 19:06.580
Aah!

19:06.580 --> 19:07.880
Don't worry.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.210
I know where there's
a lobster fest

19:09.210 --> 19:10.620
we can play at next week.

19:10.620 --> 19:11.500
Even bigger crowd.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.290
[sighs]

19:17.290 --> 19:20.380
Sorry to hear
about your chowder.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.460
Well, you held up
your end of the bargain.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.460
Are you ready to go
to Boston to see your hero?

19:24.460 --> 19:27.540
About that. Um...

19:27.540 --> 19:30.540
I don't think we're going
to go after what I tell you.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.500
You know how you said
the sleepover had to go well?

19:33.500 --> 19:35.040
Turns out, Daphne--

19:35.040 --> 19:37.880
Wants an autograph
from that science guy.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.170
I'm a big fan
of Neil deGrasse Tyson.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.670
Well, I'll go get ready.

19:43.670 --> 19:45.120
I don't want to meet
an astrophysicist

19:45.120 --> 19:46.460
smelling like
rotten chowder.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.620
Hi, Mom.

19:51.620 --> 19:52.920
What are you doing?

19:52.920 --> 19:54.830
I have to tell Mom
you're afraid of the dark.

19:54.830 --> 19:55.920
No, you don't.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.290
I'm not afraid anymore.

19:57.290 --> 19:59.290
What? Since when?

19:59.290 --> 20:02.170
The last thing you did
really cured me.

20:02.170 --> 20:03.170
I'm fine.

20:03.170 --> 20:05.040
You sure?

20:05.040 --> 20:07.880
Beause it will be night soon,
and I won't be here.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.120
Bring it on.
I'm not scared.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.540
Go do your thing.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.460
OK. Thanks.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.290
[Suzy] Let's go!
We're gonna be late.

20:19.290 --> 20:20.670
Be right there.

20:20.670 --> 20:23.670
I got my notebook, got his book,

20:23.670 --> 20:26.710
and got my
hydrogen-is-number-one
foam finger.

20:26.710 --> 20:28.710
Oh, wait. My bag.

20:39.500 --> 20:40.500
Who's there?

20:42.880 --> 20:44.120
What's going on here?

20:46.670 --> 20:47.710
Just reading.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.960
Don't wanna strain my eyes.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.040
Then you should probably
read it right side up.

21:00.620 --> 21:01.830
[cowbell rings]

21:04.380 --> 21:07.620
[sighs] Another booby trap?

21:07.620 --> 21:10.710
You're obviously
still afraid of the dark.

21:10.710 --> 21:11.750
Why didn't you tell me?

21:11.750 --> 21:14.540
Because a deal's a deal.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.620
I got to do my sleepover,
now you get to do your thing.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.830
I'm really sorry.

21:20.830 --> 21:23.420
I never thought
this could happen.

21:23.420 --> 21:25.250
I mean, the best
times of my life

21:25.250 --> 21:26.750
have been in the dark.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.710
So it's hard for me to--

21:31.670 --> 21:33.250
The best times of my life

21:33.250 --> 21:36.080
have been in the dark.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.290
Scoot over.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.710
Ahh. [sighs]

21:49.540 --> 21:52.580
I thought you were going
to see boring science guy.

21:52.580 --> 21:57.670
Can't. I think I have
an ouchie in my tum-tum.

21:57.670 --> 22:00.210
Harley no go Boston.

22:00.210 --> 22:01.250
[laughter]

22:03.040 --> 22:06.250
How would you like to
do something with me
later tonight?

22:07.830 --> 22:09.830
Sure.

22:09.830 --> 22:10.790
[Harley]
When you're little,

22:10.790 --> 22:12.790
there's a lot to be scared of.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.830
There's monsters,

22:14.830 --> 22:17.880
things that go
bump in the night...

22:17.880 --> 22:20.500
even the dark itself.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.750
But with your family
by your side,

22:22.750 --> 22:24.500
life sure is
a whole lot brighter.

Can we do it
again tomorrow?

23:02.080 --> 23:04.580
Sure.

23:04.580 --> 23:07.670
There's the Big Dipper,
and there's the Little Dipper.

23:07.670 --> 23:09.880
[Harley] I guess you
could say that's us.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.670
That's cute.

23:12.670 --> 23:16.920
Awkward timing,
but I'm gonna need you

23:16.920 --> 23:18.880
to sleep in your
own bed tonight.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.790
Me and Deathne were talking,

23:20.790 --> 23:22.460
and you're kind of
a dog-bed hog.

23:22.460 --> 23:25.540
Sleep in my own bed?
