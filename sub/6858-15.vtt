WEBVTT

00:17.851 --> 00:19.393
NARRATOR: Mysterious message!

00:20.020 --> 00:23.647
A transmission has been intercepted
far beyond the Outer Rim,

00:23.773 --> 00:25.774
deep in the Crelythiumn system.

00:25.942 --> 00:29.611
Why the call has been made,
and from where, cannot be established.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.489
But buried in the message
is a Jedi distress code

00:32.949 --> 00:35.743
that has not been used in over 2,000 years.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.705
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka,

00:39.956 --> 00:41.540
are sent to investigate.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.209
Fearing a Separatist trap,

00:44.461 --> 00:47.546
they are to meet
with a heavily armed Jedi cruiser.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.258
Rex. Rex, do you read me?

00:51.760 --> 00:55.137
We're at the rendezvous point
awaiting your arrival. Where are you?

00:55.430 --> 00:58.724
Sir, we're at the rendezvous point
and there's no sign of you on our scanners.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.101
Oh, come on. That's impossible.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.520
Something's wrong.
We're at the exact coordinates

01:03.605 --> 01:06.607
where the distress signal originated,
but there's nothing here.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.485
Rex is at the exact same coordinates,
and he's not here.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.695
This is getting interesting.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.907
(GARBLED) Unable to find you.
Where are you, sir?

01:15.325 --> 01:16.784
Something's blocking the signal.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.952
(EQUIPMENT POWERING DOWN)

01:21.039 --> 01:22.206
Not good.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.959
Everything's dead. Even the life support.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.587
This is really strange.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.672
(POWERING UP)

01:31.883 --> 01:35.469
There. See?
Nothing to be concerned about after all.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.639
Then what's that?

01:53.488 --> 01:54.988
It's pulling us towards it.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.830
Everyone, strap yourselves in.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.706
Looks as though we're going for a ride.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.942
(SIGHING GROGGILY)

02:32.735 --> 02:34.570
I must have blacked out.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.864
Then who landed the shuttle?

02:38.533 --> 02:39.783
Not me.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.202
Where are we?

02:46.040 --> 02:48.876
Some kind of organic mass.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.005
All of our readings indicate
that it's bigger than an asteroid.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.674
But at least the atmosphere is breathable.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.094
Well, this is getting more unusual
by the minute.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.555
I can't even lock down
where in the galaxy we are,

03:01.806 --> 03:04.516
or if we are even in our own galaxy.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.438
Well, the ship's systems seem fine,

03:09.522 --> 03:12.065
but for whatever reason,
nothing's working.

03:23.745 --> 03:27.497
Hey! I saw something.
A reflection, up on the hill.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.708
I don't see anything.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.681
FEMALE VOICE: Are you the one?

03:44.766 --> 03:46.225
What the... What?

03:47.018 --> 03:48.268
Did you hear that?

03:48.895 --> 03:50.229
I didn't hear anything.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.731
Are you the one?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.403
-Hello!
-Who are you?

03:58.988 --> 04:00.239
I am Daughter.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.283
Are you the one?

04:03.952 --> 04:05.786
Uh, the one what?

04:06.579 --> 04:08.080
I will take you to him.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.831
Him, who?

04:09.958 --> 04:11.375
Did you bring us here?

04:11.918 --> 04:13.710
Only he can help you.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.338
There is little time. Follow me.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.340
We must have shelter by nightfall.

04:19.884 --> 04:23.512
And we thought the planet was strange.
How about this one?

04:24.013 --> 04:26.765
We'll be fine as long as we stay together.

04:45.076 --> 04:48.245
Have you noticed the seasons
seem to change with the time of day?

04:48.371 --> 04:49.579
Yeah.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.832
And there are no animals.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.584
-And you sense it?
-Mmm-hmm. Since we arrived.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.546
The Force is very strong.

04:57.922 --> 05:02.050
An intersection unlike anything
I've ever felt before. Be wary.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.179
Excuse me. Who are you taking us to?

05:06.389 --> 05:07.556
The father, of course.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.890
Of course!

05:09.017 --> 05:10.892
And what exactly are you?

05:11.102 --> 05:13.061
We are the ones who guard the power.

05:13.187 --> 05:16.064
We are the middle, the beginning
and the end.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.275
Glad she cleared that up for us.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.074
Hey! Look out!

05:27.952 --> 05:29.578
(GRUNTING)

05:37.086 --> 05:38.545
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.715
(SHARPLY) It is forbidden
for you to touch me.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.926
Sorry. I was just saving your life.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.262
That was my brother's work.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.431
You are in great danger.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.601
Wait for me. Do not leave this place.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.105
Hey. Wait!

05:57.273 --> 05:58.482
OBI-WAN: Anakin, are you there?

05:59.233 --> 06:00.484
Are you all right?

06:01.611 --> 06:04.488
Yeah. But our friend here has run off!

06:05.239 --> 06:07.783
Go back to the ship
and try sending another distress call.

06:08.117 --> 06:11.244
I'll follow her
and find out how to get off this rock.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.121
And if this is a trap?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.665
Then I'm not gonna wait around
to find out.

06:16.125 --> 06:19.419
Anakin, stop! Wait for us to find
another way around and meet you.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.962
-(STATIC)
-Anakin?

06:22.298 --> 06:24.591
So reckless and impatient.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.468
He'll find her.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.637
Yes, and what else?

06:31.974 --> 06:33.183
Storm's coming.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.818
-The ship's gone!
-Yes, I see that.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.821
It was here, no question.

06:46.531 --> 06:50.158
And look, everything's dying.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.536
Did you lose something?

06:53.996 --> 06:55.705
You didn't do as you were asked.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.999
And what was that?

06:58.835 --> 07:01.128
My sister said to wait!

07:01.504 --> 07:04.965
Did she, now?
Well, we were unfortunately separated.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.884
We'd like our ship back, if you don't mind.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.178
Not yet.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.682
Is it true that he is the Chosen One?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.310
What do you know of such things?

07:17.854 --> 07:20.564
What is about to happen shall occur,

07:21.357 --> 07:23.567
whether you like it or not.

07:25.820 --> 07:26.987
You are Sith!

07:27.196 --> 07:28.238
Sith?

07:28.322 --> 07:29.906
(CHUCKLING)

07:30.158 --> 07:31.241
Yes.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.034
And no.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.372
The storms here are quite lethal.

07:37.748 --> 07:41.209
If you want to live,
I suggest you find shelter.

07:45.089 --> 07:48.258
What in the universe was that?

07:48.426 --> 07:49.676
I'm not quite sure.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.266
Quick. There's a cave over there.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.909
Whoever I'm looking for
is in that monastery.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.245
Welcome, my friend.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.872
What is it that you want from me?

09:01.457 --> 09:04.960
To learn the truth
about who you really are.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.463
One that maybe you have known all along.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.718
One you must believe
in order to fulfill your destiny.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.429
Enough with the riddles, old man.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.098
Tell me what's going on here.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.688
As you can see,
there is nowhere else to go.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.815
It is late.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.484
You will be my guest tonight.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.766
Obi-Wan, have you done as I asked?
Have you trained the boy?

10:02.393 --> 10:04.894
Master Qui-Gon? How are you here?

10:05.688 --> 10:07.397
I am here because you are here.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.482
No. I don't understand.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.067
What is this place?

10:11.652 --> 10:12.819
Unlike any other,

10:12.945 --> 10:16.531
a conduit through which
the entire force of the universe flows.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.366
Are we in danger?

10:19.076 --> 10:21.953
This planet is both an amplifier
and a magnet.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.831
Three are here who seek Skywalker.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.959
They, like me,
believe him to be the Chosen One.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.880
You were right,

10:32.173 --> 10:35.467
the Force within him
is stronger than any known Jedi.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.303
I have trained him as well as I could,

10:38.512 --> 10:41.097
but he's still willful
and balance eludes him.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.851
If he is the Chosen One,
he will discover it here.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.686
And if not?

10:47.021 --> 10:48.897
Then you must realize, with his power,

10:48.981 --> 10:51.691
this is a very dangerous place
for him to be.

11:15.633 --> 11:19.135
Wake up, my son. I must tell you a secret.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.846
Who's there? Who's there, I said?

11:22.139 --> 11:24.599
It is me, Ani. Your mother.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.605
What kind of black arts is this?

11:31.148 --> 11:32.607
You're dead.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.777
Nothing ever really dies, my son.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.613
I have a secret to tell you.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.491
Then tell me.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.827
Everything you have done,

11:44.078 --> 11:45.495
everything you have learned,

11:45.579 --> 11:46.746
has led you here.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.791
Whatever you are, my mother is...

11:51.293 --> 11:54.170
-Is dead.
-And you blame yourself.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.966
Your Jedi training
has served you well, Ani,

11:58.551 --> 12:00.802
but you are more than a Jedi.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.180
Tell me, where is your pain,

12:04.974 --> 12:06.599
so I might take it away?

12:07.518 --> 12:10.562
I was too late to save you.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.524
I failed as a Jedi, and I failed you.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.484
How so?

12:17.236 --> 12:18.570
I tasted only vengeance

12:18.654 --> 12:21.114
when I slaughtered so many
to avenge your death.

12:21.866 --> 12:26.035
It is time you realized that your guilt
does not define you, my son.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.246
You define your guilt.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.541
The only love I feel in my heart

12:32.209 --> 12:34.794
is haunted by what would happen
should I let go.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.839
Then it is not love. It is a prison.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.384
But I have a wife. You've met her.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.053
She's everything to me.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.847
She is not your destiny.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.140
But I love her!

12:47.308 --> 12:49.934
(DISTORTED) No! She is a poisoner!

12:50.144 --> 12:51.561
What are you?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.438
Your fate!

13:03.282 --> 13:04.741
FEMALE VOICE: Are you happy, child?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.542
Your master, does he treat you well?

13:18.672 --> 13:20.757
What concern of it is yours?

13:21.383 --> 13:24.385
I am your future, your potential.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.429
This is a trick.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.349
There is a wildness to you, young one.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.602
Seeds of the dark side
planted by your master.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.938
-Do you feel it?
-No!

13:35.147 --> 13:37.232
He is like no other Jedi.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.650
Passionate, impulsive,

13:39.151 --> 13:40.860
but I trust him with my life.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.822
There are many contradictions in you.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.782
And in him.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.163
Be warned! You may never see your future

13:52.248 --> 13:53.957
if you remain his student.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.542
Leave this planet!

13:58.087 --> 13:59.337
OBI-WAN: Ahsoka?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.132
I had a vision.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.468
I think Anakin may be in trouble.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.561
Cannot sleep?

14:15.938 --> 14:19.566
To strike an unarmed man
is hardly the Jedi way.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.151
You're a Sith Lord!

14:22.820 --> 14:25.780
You have a very simple view
of the universe.

14:26.657 --> 14:29.075
I am neither Sith nor Jedi.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.828
I am much more.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.122
And so are you.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.834
I see through your spells
and visions, old man.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.044
Tell me what is going on here!

14:47.344 --> 14:49.888
Some call us Force-wielders.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.394
The Jedi have never spoken of this.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.645
Hmm.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.064
Few still know of our existence.

15:01.483 --> 15:05.278
In that room, my mother came to me.
But it was not her.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.655
-It was something else.
-Ah.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.116
My son, I suspect.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.702
We can take many forms.

15:13.287 --> 15:18.458
The shapes we embody are merely
a reflection of the life force around us.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.629
You carry a great sadness in your heart.

15:23.839 --> 15:28.217
My children and I
can manipulate the Force like no other,

15:29.094 --> 15:32.764
therefore it was necessary
to withdraw from the temporal world

15:33.057 --> 15:35.016
and live here as anchorites.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.685
As a sanctuary?

15:38.312 --> 15:39.437
And a prison.

15:40.564 --> 15:45.276
You cannot imagine what pain it is
to have such love for your children

15:45.694 --> 15:49.447
and realize that they could tear
the very fabric of our universe.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.158
I don't understand.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.620
It is only here that I can control them.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.749
A family in balance. The light and the dark.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.751
Day with night.

16:02.169 --> 16:05.171
Destruction replaced by creation.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.966
Then why reveal yourselves to us?

16:09.510 --> 16:12.345
There are some
who would like to exploit our power.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.640
The Sith are but one.

16:16.225 --> 16:20.728
Too much dark or light would be
the undoing of life as you understand it.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.983
When news reached me
that the Chosen One had been found,

16:25.734 --> 16:28.194
I needed to see for myself.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.530
The Chosen One is a myth.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.699
Is it?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.535
I should very much like to know.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.205
Why don't we find out together?

16:40.332 --> 16:44.210
Pass one test and I shall know the truth.

16:45.629 --> 16:49.132
Then, you and your friends may leave.

17:01.270 --> 17:05.189
The longer we stay here,
the stranger this place gets.

17:05.774 --> 17:08.276
It appears the planet is renewing herself.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.695
What about Master Skywalker?

17:11.113 --> 17:13.281
Anakin will not be easy to deceive.

17:40.225 --> 17:44.854
It is time to face your guilt
and know the truth.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.122
(HISSING)

18:03.665 --> 18:06.250
Whatever he wants, don't do it, Master!

18:08.420 --> 18:09.921
(GRUNTING)

18:11.340 --> 18:14.592
Let them go. I will not play your games.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.345
Oh, but I think you will.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.182
I have ordered my children
to kill your friends.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.267
The question is,

18:26.105 --> 18:28.564
which one will you choose to save?

18:30.192 --> 18:31.692
Your master?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.612
Or your apprentice?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.782
You must now release the guilt

18:38.200 --> 18:40.868
and free yourself by choosing.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.370
No!

18:43.288 --> 18:45.706
Their powers are too strong
for us, Anakin!

18:46.041 --> 18:47.458
Save Ahsoka!

18:49.711 --> 18:51.379
(GROANING)

18:51.755 --> 18:53.965
Let them go.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.218
Only you can make my children
release them.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.764
Anakin! The planet is the Force.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.891
Use it.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.645
(DISTORTED) You will let them go!

19:51.064 --> 19:52.106
(GROWLING)

19:52.149 --> 19:53.274
Down!

20:00.782 --> 20:02.700
On your knees!

20:19.176 --> 20:22.345
And now you see who you truly are.

20:23.013 --> 20:26.307
Only the Chosen One
could tame both my children.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.144
I've taken your test.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.521
Now fulfill your promise and let us go.

20:33.190 --> 20:37.485
Ah, but first, you must understand the truth.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.821
Now, all of you, leave us.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.991
Do not trust him.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.493
You think?

20:45.535 --> 20:47.578
I said, leave us!

20:52.668 --> 20:54.543
Do you feel your destiny?

20:55.337 --> 20:57.004
You must see it now.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.006
I am dying,

20:59.758 --> 21:01.842
and you must replace me.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.596
Replace you? I can't stay here.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.848
But this is yours.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.519
It has been foretold.
The Chosen One will remain

21:11.561 --> 21:13.771
to keep my children in balance.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.357
No.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.569
I cannot force you to do this.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.364
The choice must be yours.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.783
But leave

21:25.867 --> 21:30.371
and your selfishness shall haunt you
and the galaxy.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.046
Ready to get out of here?

22:33.602 --> 22:34.602
