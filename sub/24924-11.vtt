WEBVTT

00:17.550 --> 00:19.711
[theme music playing]

00:40.040 --> 00:42.907
[Bryce] People talk a lot about
what it means to be a member of a team.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.285
["Head On" plays]

00:44.370 --> 00:47.282
- As soon as I get my head around you
-[player] Shred, shred!

00:47.880 --> 00:50.747
I come around
Catching sparks off you

00:51.250 --> 00:53.582
I get an electric charge from you

00:53.670 --> 00:54.967
-[grunts]
-[whistle blows]

00:55.220 --> 00:56.209
[Bryce] Thanks, man.

00:58.140 --> 01:00.256
[crowd cheering]

01:01.470 --> 01:02.630
[Bryce] The brotherhood,

01:02.720 --> 01:05.473
the sense of belonging
to something greater than yourself.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.379
[player 1] Set, go!

01:09.690 --> 01:12.067
[player 2] Hold the ball!
Hold the ball!

01:12.530 --> 01:14.521
[player 3] Hey, it's going right,
it's going right!

01:15.200 --> 01:16.736
Throwing right, throwing right.

01:18.740 --> 01:22.198
Makes you wanna feel
Makes you wanna try

01:22.290 --> 01:25.612
Makes you wanna blow
The stars from the slq

01:25.710 --> 01:29.077
I can't stand up
I can't cool down

01:29.170 --> 01:33.664
I can't get my head
Off the ground

01:33.760 --> 01:36.797
[Bryce] It's about fighting together,
but it's also about family.

01:37.260 --> 01:40.252
About knowing who will be there
for you, always.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.887
As soon as I get my head
Around you

01:42.970 --> 01:46.303
I come around
Catching sparks off you

01:46.390 --> 01:51.100
And all I ever got from you
Was all I ever...

01:51.190 --> 01:52.430
[Bryce] And when it's right,

01:52.520 --> 01:56.524
when it's 11 guys working as one,
there's nothing like it.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.401
-[player] Set, go!
-[all grunting]

02:00.490 --> 02:02.981
The world could die in pain

02:03.620 --> 02:06.407
And I wouldn't feel no shame

02:06.870 --> 02:09.919
And there's nothing
Holding me to blame

02:10.500 --> 02:13.992
Makes you wanna feel
Makes you wanna try

02:14.090 --> 02:17.127
Makes you wanna blow
The stars from the slq

02:17.220 --> 02:20.678
And I'm taking myself
To a dirty part of town

02:20.760 --> 02:25.629
Where all my troubles
Can't be found

02:25.720 --> 02:28.632
-[crowd roaring]
-[Bryce] No greater feeling in the world.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.726
[all cheering]

02:36.320 --> 02:39.357
[cheering]

02:40.990 --> 02:42.309
-Fuck me, you're heavy.
-Hey!

02:42.410 --> 02:44.696
Yeah, man, no wonder
Westfield couldn't tackle your ass.

02:44.910 --> 02:47.868
Fuck you guys.
My fat ass saved yours, butterfingers.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.156
-[Zach] Hey!
-Ouch!

02:49.660 --> 02:52.458
Luclq I was doubled up all night
or else you wouldn't have gotten shit.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.031
-And I thank you.
-Dude, that catch? Insane!

02:55.130 --> 02:57.371
You're so getting your dick sucked
tonight!

02:57.800 --> 02:59.165
Monty, you wanna do the honors?

02:59.260 --> 03:01.672
You know what? I would.
That's how amazing that catch was.

03:02.050 --> 03:03.290
Party at your place, Walker?

03:03.390 --> 03:04.709
_ -No. _
-H|s parents are In town.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.347
-We're hitting the docks.
-See you guys.

03:06.430 --> 03:07.260
See ya.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.671
[chatter]

03:16.650 --> 03:18.891
-Great game, Bryce!
-Thanks, Mr. Dempsey.

03:27.910 --> 03:29.036
Looking for someone?

03:29.370 --> 03:33.454
No, I, um... Iwasjust... No.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.332
I'm Hannah. We met at Kat's party.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.706
Yes. Yeah, no, I remembered.
I-- I was just--

03:39.800 --> 03:40.835
It's cool. Yeah.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.256
Probably all those concussions
out there.

03:43.340 --> 03:44.921
Yeah, something like that.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.307
Didn't know you were a football fan.

03:48.390 --> 03:50.767
-My mom made me come.
-Oh, okay, okay.

03:50.850 --> 03:54.559
Yeah. She said it'd be good for me
to meet people, make some friends.

03:55.650 --> 03:59.643
And now she's off somewhere
making friends for herself, and here I am.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.679
Well, at least she's here.

04:01.780 --> 04:06.649
Mine are apparently still in Zurich
or wherever the hell it is this week.

04:07.030 --> 04:08.861
Can your parents take mine with them
sometime?

04:08.950 --> 04:10.577
Absolutely. I'll talk to them about that.

04:10.660 --> 04:11.490
Good game, man.

04:15.210 --> 04:18.452
-I, uh... I should go find my mother.
-Sure. Sure.

04:20.670 --> 04:21.830
[Bryce] Hey, friend.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.540
Let's hang out sometime.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.807
[Bryce] Maybe that's why
Hannah pursued me,

04:29.890 --> 04:31.551
because she had never felt that...

04:32.430 --> 04:34.136
that sense of belonging.

04:34.810 --> 04:36.266
[Nora] Aren't the glasses a bit much?

04:37.230 --> 04:39.437
Yeah, I haven't worn these
in, like, forever.

04:39.770 --> 04:42.989
Warren thinks they make him look
more empathetic, relatable.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.980
And can't he just be those things?

04:45.530 --> 04:47.987
Look, Warren is the best there is
at reading a jury.

04:48.450 --> 04:50.190
Our family's on trial today.

04:51.370 --> 04:53.440
You shouldn't even be in that room,
for Christ's sake.

04:53.540 --> 04:56.703
We could've fought off a bullshit subpoena
for a rinlq-dink lawsuit.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.918
I got this. I spent, like, four hours
with Warren and his guys.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.490
-We're good.
-[Nora] Are we good?

05:02.010 --> 05:04.001
The reporters out front
didn't seem to think so.

05:04.090 --> 05:04.966
Enough.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.045
The kid doesn't need any more static.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.511
[Jessica] If she doesn't know
this happened to her,

05:16.600 --> 05:18.090
she's gonna be destroyed.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.607
And once she does,
I'm not gonna be the one

05:20.690 --> 05:22.817
who tells her that the whole world
needs to know, too.

05:23.940 --> 05:25.896
They're gonna have
to take down Bryce without her.

05:26.530 --> 05:28.691
-He's just going to lie.
-[Jessica] Maybe.

05:29.070 --> 05:31.652
But you go up there
thinking you'll know what to say,

05:31.740 --> 05:34.618
and then it ends up going
another way completely, you know?

05:35.250 --> 05:38.458
Yeah, which is how I know
we can't count on them to get Bryce.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.242
Look, if we don't stop this,
there will be more Chles...

05:43.960 --> 05:45.040
and Bryces...

05:47.970 --> 05:48.880
and Ninas.

05:51.550 --> 05:52.505
Oh, my God.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.806
[Clay] This is proof, Jessica.

05:56.930 --> 05:59.433
Proof of who Bryce is, who they all are.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.685
Proof that you're not alone.

06:01.770 --> 06:03.067
And that makes it easier?

06:03.520 --> 06:06.273
What, like we're some part
of a fucking club?

06:08.070 --> 06:09.401
Jesus, you guys...

06:10.620 --> 06:12.736
Wait, we-- That might be evidence.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.445
Well, it doesn't belong to you.

06:32.550 --> 06:33.847
Aren't you pissed off?

06:34.390 --> 06:36.517
I've made a lot of enemies in this town.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.510
It's Bryce.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.766
-You think so?
-Yes.

06:39.850 --> 06:42.148
No, he wouldn't get his hands dirty
with this.

06:42.440 --> 06:43.816
But who else would it be?

06:45.360 --> 06:47.237
Bryce has money.

06:47.690 --> 06:53.526
And boys like him, men like him,
they have protectors and enablers

06:53.830 --> 06:57.573
and people with lots to lose
if they're found out.

07:01.540 --> 07:03.280
Can I come to court with you today?

07:09.340 --> 07:10.159
Okay.

07:17.060 --> 07:18.459
Why are you in this picture?

07:20.020 --> 07:22.807
I'm sure I can't tell you anything worse
than what you're imagining.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.395
[Clay] I don't know.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.108
So far, things have been worse
than I ever would've imagined.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.191
What do you want me to say, Clay?

07:35.910 --> 07:37.571
Would you believe nothing happened?

07:40.410 --> 07:41.240
[Clay stammers]

07:42.040 --> 07:46.079
How did you end up in the Clubhouse?
I mean, whose jacket is it?

07:46.670 --> 07:47.955
You know I dated Justin.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.586
He said he didn't know
about the Clubhouse.

07:51.420 --> 07:52.296
And you believe him?

07:53.090 --> 07:54.136
I don't know. I...

07:55.260 --> 07:56.670
So, what do you wanna hear?

07:56.890 --> 07:58.505
That I dated half the baseball team?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.261
That they got me high and fucked me blind?

08:00.430 --> 08:01.260
I...

08:01.770 --> 08:02.976
I wanna know the truth.

08:03.390 --> 08:06.359
I told you my truth,
but you don't believe me.

08:06.810 --> 08:09.688
You say you love me, but you're always
willing to believe the worst of me.

08:23.660 --> 08:26.379
[Jessica] Clay Jensen has the rest.
They're safe.

08:27.750 --> 08:31.208
I know how much you talk
about your story being yours, so...

08:31.960 --> 08:34.258
I thought you should get to decide
what to do with this.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.598
Yeah, but the thing is
is that this isn't my story.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.800
This is the lie.

08:42.350 --> 08:45.979
That I was into it and having fun,
you know?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.391
And I guess I was, you know, until...

08:51.610 --> 08:53.237
But there's no picture of that, is there?

08:54.820 --> 08:55.650
No proof.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.237
You know, maybe if there was, maybe...

08:59.200 --> 09:01.407
maybe I'd be dealing with my shit
a little better, right?

09:01.490 --> 09:05.574
Nina, I am so sorry that I said
that stuff to you yesterday, honestly.

09:06.620 --> 09:07.621
You were right, though.

09:09.040 --> 09:09.870
I...

09:12.170 --> 09:14.297
I cheated on Garrett with Michael.

09:15.970 --> 09:18.336
-And when you called me out--
-I didn't mean to call you out.

09:18.430 --> 09:19.715
No, but you should have.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.176
[Nina breathes shakily]

09:22.310 --> 09:23.880
I wanted to be strong for you...

09:25.180 --> 09:26.932
to be what you needed, but I'm not.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.602
And I don't think that I ever will be.

09:42.660 --> 09:46.653
You said that Hannah pursued you
after that football game

09:46.750 --> 09:48.411
at the beginning of your junior year.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.530
Did it ever turn physical?

09:51.090 --> 09:54.457
Yes. We had kind of an on-again,
off-again thing.

09:54.630 --> 09:57.337
[Sonya] So... you had sex
more than once?

09:57.430 --> 09:58.249
[Bryce] We did.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.673
[Sonya] So, Hannah initiated
this "on-again, off-again thing"?

10:02.810 --> 10:03.845
Yes, she did.

10:03.930 --> 10:06.808
She took me to Hickman's Bridge...

10:07.810 --> 10:10.893
which, honestly, I remember thinking
was kind of creepy.

10:12.230 --> 10:16.894
[Hannah] I like the idea that somebody
built this thing that holds people up,

10:16.990 --> 10:18.480
helps them get where they need to go.

10:19.070 --> 10:21.118
And yet, one wrong turn...

10:22.370 --> 10:25.362
and you're plummeting
down, down, down, splat.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.319
Game over.

10:27.660 --> 10:30.458
-Did you take me out here to murder me?
-[laughs]

10:31.380 --> 10:33.029
No, I just... [laughs]

10:34.920 --> 10:39.710
You know, we take it for granted--
life and, like, how precarious it is.

10:41.470 --> 10:45.463
I don't know, coming here,
it helps me step out of mine sometimes.

10:47.810 --> 10:48.629
Yeah.

10:49.060 --> 10:51.142
And to remember how precious life is.

10:52.020 --> 10:52.850
Exactly.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.070
[Sonya] How do you mean "it was creepy"?

11:10.870 --> 11:14.328
Well, just the whole bridge thing.
Being obsessed with a place like that.

11:14.460 --> 11:17.543
I just wish I had realized
it might have been a sign.

11:18.170 --> 11:20.547
[Sonya] And how many times
did you go to Hickman's Bridge?

11:21.050 --> 11:23.587
Gosh, I don't know. Um, quite a few.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.217
I guess it kind of became our place.

11:26.850 --> 11:28.169
[Sonya] And what did you do there?

11:28.890 --> 11:32.894
[Bryce] Sometimes we just made out,
um, looked at the stars.

11:33.350 --> 11:34.430
Sometimes we made love.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.146
-Are you sure you want to?
-I'm sure.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.533
[Sonya] Did things ever evolve
into a committed relationship?

11:49.870 --> 11:50.780
Not really.

11:51.290 --> 11:52.245
Did you want it to?

11:52.830 --> 11:59.451
Um, I had a great time with Hannah,
but she wasn't really girlfriend material.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.165
Hannah had a reputation.

12:02.260 --> 12:06.173
And she didn't deserve it at all,
but you know how kids are.

12:06.930 --> 12:10.058
I was too ashamed to admit
that I was having sex with her.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.380
And how did Hannah feel about that?

12:12.810 --> 12:14.095
I think she wanted more.

12:14.520 --> 12:18.729
She would always hang around after
football games, after baseball practice...

12:18.940 --> 12:20.601
["High" plays]

12:22.070 --> 12:24.903
Isn't it, like, freedom,
being on your own, though?

12:25.320 --> 12:28.198
I mean, I think your life sounds amazing.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.031
Yeah, yeah, it mostly is.

12:33.540 --> 12:35.417
-That looks good on you.
-[chuckles]

12:35.620 --> 12:38.088
-Let me get a picture.
-Oh, no way. No photos.

12:38.170 --> 12:41.207
-Come on! You're so beautiful.
-[laughs]

12:43.130 --> 12:44.677
I would probably hide the pipe, though.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.966
You don't want people to think
you're a complete stoner.

12:48.050 --> 12:49.551
[Bryce laughs]

12:50.560 --> 12:51.379
All right.

12:54.770 --> 12:55.680
So beautiful.

12:58.270 --> 13:00.101
-Unh-unh.
-Oh, God, no!

13:00.190 --> 13:01.521
-I don't want to see it.
-What?

13:01.650 --> 13:04.027
-I don't want to look at myself.
-Seriously?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.770
Because I could look at you forever.

13:07.950 --> 13:10.077
High

13:11.490 --> 13:16.416
Over the north star
Sleepless, so far

13:16.500 --> 13:22.166
Together, we are high

13:23.670 --> 13:27.049
Trapped in the holiday affair

13:27.130 --> 13:31.339
A new silence filled the air

13:32.470 --> 13:35.132
I rest my head on your shoulder

13:38.400 --> 13:42.393
There's nowhere else I'd rather be

13:44.530 --> 13:46.987
Right there, a little bit slower

13:47.070 --> 13:48.810
[Hannah] I wanted to be with him forever.

13:50.070 --> 13:51.276
I was in love with him.

13:53.240 --> 13:57.324
[Sonya] Bryce, you said that Hannah wanted
a more serious relationship, yes?

13:57.410 --> 13:58.240
[Bryce] Yes.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.127
-[Sonya] Did she tell you so?
-[Bryce] She did.

14:00.630 --> 14:02.621
-When?
-The night of my party.

14:02.710 --> 14:05.338
And that was the party
on September 30th?

14:05.420 --> 14:06.250
Correct.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.633
And what made you think that Hannah
wanted something more serious?

14:10.180 --> 14:11.590
Because she told me so.

14:11.970 --> 14:14.712
After we had sex, she said
that she wanted to be exclusive.

14:14.810 --> 14:18.268
And I said, you know,
"I like you, but as a friend."

14:18.640 --> 14:21.052
[Sonya] So how do you explain
Hannah's report

14:21.150 --> 14:23.641
that you did something to her
at that party?

14:24.110 --> 14:25.725
She lied to Mr. Porter.

14:26.110 --> 14:27.179
Why would she do that?

14:28.200 --> 14:32.318
Because she was hurt and angry.
I-- I get that.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.440
I tried to let her down gently.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.326
Hannah really was a fantastic girl,

14:37.080 --> 14:41.915
but, look, she let her emotions
carry her away, right?

14:42.460 --> 14:46.123
In high school... it's emotional.

14:47.210 --> 14:49.371
What if Marcus calls your dad, too, huh?

14:54.390 --> 14:55.755
We have to get him back, you know?

14:59.640 --> 15:01.392
I'm trying to look out for you, okay?

15:02.650 --> 15:03.639
What about my sister?

15:05.650 --> 15:07.220
I told you, I'm sorry about everything--

15:07.320 --> 15:08.309
[boy] Hey, Tyler.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.065
You wanna go to a movie sometime?

15:11.160 --> 15:11.979
[moans]

15:12.070 --> 15:13.981
-[boys laugh]
-[girls gasp]

15:20.540 --> 15:22.872
Thank you very much. Mr. Wentworth.

15:23.710 --> 15:24.529
[girl] Here you go.

15:24.790 --> 15:28.044
[Rick] Thank you. Paxton.
Thank you very much.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.757
I was surprised to see you in class.

15:33.970 --> 15:37.462
Oh, yeah, I uh... figured my education
was more important

15:37.560 --> 15:39.209
than sitting around a courtroom, you know.

15:39.850 --> 15:40.669
'Course.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.557
Plus, can't play ball
without that average, right?

15:45.310 --> 15:50.486
-[scoffs] Uh, listen, Coach, 1--
-Look, you had a disagreement, okay?

15:51.280 --> 15:53.316
It happens. Sometimes brothers fight.

15:54.070 --> 15:56.072
But that doesn't mean_
they're not still your family.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.821
Those guys aren't my family.

15:59.370 --> 16:00.359
Well, what about me?

16:02.210 --> 16:05.782
Wasn't I there for you
when you came to me last summer?

16:08.340 --> 16:10.410
-Yeah.
-Didn't we figure that out together?

16:11.510 --> 16:13.831
How to be strong for your family,
your mom?

16:15.090 --> 16:15.920
Little May?

16:17.760 --> 16:23.471
Zach, you think you can be there
for your team and for me... now?

16:25.060 --> 16:27.517
You don't get to do that, okay?

16:27.610 --> 16:29.771
Just because you were there,
you think you can...?

16:31.610 --> 16:35.273
You know, if you were any kind of father,
to this team or to anyone,

16:36.620 --> 16:38.406
you would've stopped their bullshit
years ago.

16:40.580 --> 16:41.569
That means I quit.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.790
Bryce, you've gotten physical
with other classmates

16:51.880 --> 16:53.086
against their wishes, haven't you?

16:53.670 --> 16:55.968
Uh, not that I remember, no.

16:56.470 --> 16:57.425
Not Tyler Down?

16:57.510 --> 16:59.717
Isn't it true that you threw Tyler Down
against a locker?

16:59.810 --> 17:03.553
Oh, maybe, but that's just guys
messing around.

17:03.770 --> 17:04.976
He-- He knew I was joking.

17:05.140 --> 17:07.267
So you think Tyler thought
you were messing around?

17:07.350 --> 17:09.102
-[Sonya] Objection.
-Withdrawn.

17:09.610 --> 17:11.521
Let's talk about this party
that you mentioned.

17:11.610 --> 17:14.397
It was on September 30th
of last year, right?

17:14.490 --> 17:16.151
-Correct.
-It was a Saturday?

17:16.360 --> 17:17.770
-Yes.
-It was a nice night?

17:18.240 --> 17:19.776
Lots of stars, full moon?

17:19.950 --> 17:20.769
Yeah.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.900
-And your parents were out of town?
-Yes.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.208
You were celebrating a big football win
from the night before, right?

17:26.710 --> 17:28.917
We were celebrating a loss, actually.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.456
-Uh...
-[boys laugh]

17:30.540 --> 17:32.201
[Bryce laughs]
We don't win all that often.

17:33.050 --> 17:35.837
[Dennis] You were celebrating a loss,
and people had a drink or two?

17:36.510 --> 17:37.329
Yes.

17:37.430 --> 17:39.716
-Maybe three or four?
-Sure.

17:39.930 --> 17:41.966
-And Hannah Baker was there?
-Yes.

17:42.180 --> 17:43.886
And she was somebody
that you knew well,

17:44.180 --> 17:46.011
-but who you weren't dating, right?
-Right.

17:46.270 --> 17:48.898
-And Hannah got in the hot tub with you?
-Yes.

17:49.190 --> 17:50.851
And everybody else got out
of the hot tub?

17:50.940 --> 17:51.759
Yes.

17:51.860 --> 17:53.475
-And you started to make out with her?
-Yeah.

17:53.820 --> 17:56.106
And you wanted to have sex
with her, right?

17:56.700 --> 17:57.519
Yes.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.100
-And you got really into it?
-Sure.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.116
And you assumed
that she was into it, too,

18:01.200 --> 18:02.110
-correct?
-Yes.

18:02.330 --> 18:05.743
So you turned her around
to take her from behind, right?

18:07.330 --> 18:08.160
Yes.

18:08.790 --> 18:11.452
-You pulled down her underwear, right?
-Yes.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.588
And you took your own suit off
as well, correct?

18:15.130 --> 18:16.040
-Yes.
-[Dennis] And, Bryce,

18:16.130 --> 18:17.620
you usually use protection, don't you?

18:18.590 --> 18:20.467
Uh, I do, usually.

18:20.550 --> 18:23.849
But you didn't use protection with her
on that night, correct?

18:25.100 --> 18:26.089
Correct.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.887
[Dennis] And you two didn't talk
about STDs or pregnancies, right?

18:28.980 --> 18:29.935
[Bryce] We did not, no.

18:30.020 --> 18:32.853
And she never did actually say,
"I want to have sex with you,"

18:32.940 --> 18:35.352
-isn't that correct?
-Correct.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.193
And she didn't make any specific
gestures to indicate consent,

18:38.280 --> 18:42.023
-isn't that correct?
-What, like... a thumbs-up?

18:42.120 --> 18:44.862
-Did she give you a thumbs-up?
-She did not.

18:44.950 --> 18:47.077
Then you had sex with her
against her will, isn't that correct?

18:47.160 --> 18:50.209
No. No, that is not correct.
She came on to me.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.838
She came on to you, but she never said
she wanted to have sex with you,

18:52.920 --> 18:55.332
-isn't that correct?
-She clearly wanted to hook up.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.251
But she never gave you her consent,
isn't that right?

18:57.460 --> 18:58.791
I-- I knew what she wanted.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.428
You knew what she wanted, and yet
when she went to the school counselor

19:01.510 --> 19:04.138
and reported that she had
been assaulted, that was a lie?

19:04.300 --> 19:05.927
-Correct.
-Why would she lie?

19:06.010 --> 19:08.638
-[Sonya] Objection. Calls for speculation.
-[Dennis] I'll rephrase.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.136
Was there anything in your encounter

19:10.230 --> 19:12.858
that would have led Hannah to report
that she had been raped?

19:13.400 --> 19:15.311
[sighs] I-- I wish I knew.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.231
I would never do that to any girl.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.481
When I think about my mom
or my girlfriend...

19:22.990 --> 19:24.821
[whispers] Guys, Chle took off.

19:25.580 --> 19:27.195
[Bryce]
I would never want anyone to hurt them.

19:28.370 --> 19:29.701
And I never hurt Hannah.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.955
[boy 1] But I saw it.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.160
-[boy 2] Oh.
-[Bryce] Ah!

19:40.260 --> 19:41.579
[boys laughing, chattering]

19:42.010 --> 19:44.592
He lies through his fucking teeth
and everybody shakes his hand.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.131
-Are we sure he lied?
-Jesus, Clay, come on.

19:49.220 --> 19:50.517
Those fucking glasses?

19:50.770 --> 19:52.761
[Alex] We can't tell Jessica
about any of this.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.565
We have to tell Jessica.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.110
We need Chle.

20:17.590 --> 20:19.126
Hey, Kevin.

20:19.960 --> 20:20.790
Coach.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.713
Listen. Have you been talking
to Zach Dempsey?

20:25.140 --> 20:26.755
No, not lately. Why?

20:27.300 --> 20:31.088
He's talking about quitting the team
because of this thing with Bryce.

20:31.390 --> 20:33.551
Mm-hmm. "This thing."

20:34.140 --> 20:36.722
-You mean that Bryce is a rapist.
-[scoffs] Okay.

20:37.730 --> 20:41.063
Kev, come on.
Innocent until proven guilty, huh?

20:41.360 --> 20:42.566
So you think he's innocent?

20:43.570 --> 20:44.480
I think he is.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.566
I think that this is a witch hunt.

20:48.620 --> 20:53.068
A troubled girl took her own life,
and we want to blame,

20:53.160 --> 20:54.912
but it's not that simple.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.508
I would've thought you of all people
would appreciate that, Kev.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.749
No one wants a record.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.584
[Mr. Porter chuckles]

21:08.140 --> 21:09.846
No. No, you're right.

21:11.310 --> 21:13.847
No one wants to be
on the wrong side of the law.

21:30.740 --> 21:31.695
What do you want?

21:33.370 --> 21:35.076
I heard you walked out of court today...

21:35.910 --> 21:37.207
while Bryce was on the stand.

21:40.540 --> 21:43.122
Look, I know you're the one
who crossed out all that bullshit

21:43.210 --> 21:44.336
about me in the stall.

21:47.180 --> 21:47.999
Why?

21:51.970 --> 21:53.267
Because you were on the squad.

21:54.350 --> 21:55.510
I wanted to protect you.

21:57.690 --> 21:59.260
I had already quit by then.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.187
Do you remember going to a place
called the Clubhouse?

22:06.070 --> 22:06.946
[Chle sighs]

22:11.660 --> 22:14.197
This is gonna be hard to look at, okay?

22:25.760 --> 22:27.409
Do you remember this happening?

22:27.510 --> 22:28.420
[Chle gasps]

22:32.890 --> 22:33.709
Chle.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.016
You don't remember, do you?

22:36.520 --> 22:37.418
[Chle exhales]

22:40.940 --> 22:42.055
Why would he do this?

22:42.980 --> 22:47.064
Because... because he's a bad guy.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.230
He's sick.

22:50.740 --> 22:54.449
He's done this to me and you
and who knows who else.

22:55.990 --> 22:57.321
And he takes pictures,

22:58.410 --> 23:01.208
or, in my case, puts them up
on a whiteboard at school.

23:05.670 --> 23:08.047
-Oh, God. Jess.
-What?

23:09.260 --> 23:10.079
I never...

23:13.600 --> 23:16.888
I-- I thought those pictures
would scare you

23:16.970 --> 23:19.052
into not calling Bryce out in court.

23:20.770 --> 23:22.476
Wait, you put them up?

23:23.560 --> 23:26.108
-I'm so sorry.
-What else have you done?

23:26.860 --> 23:28.179
It was just the pictures.

23:29.860 --> 23:30.690
Ijust...

23:32.240 --> 23:34.822
I wanted to believe
the rumors about you were true.

23:37.620 --> 23:39.440
God, he fucking lied to me.

23:42.870 --> 23:44.622
Do you wanna do something about it?

23:55.800 --> 23:56.846
What if it's true?

23:57.680 --> 23:59.216
Jesus, what if it's true?

23:59.310 --> 24:01.471
How could you possibly believe it's true?

24:02.230 --> 24:03.720
The stuff about Zach was true.

24:04.020 --> 24:05.305
Zach's a good person.

24:06.230 --> 24:07.436
Deep down, he's a lot like you.

24:07.610 --> 24:09.316
Oh, God, don't say shit like that.

24:09.900 --> 24:11.390
Zach's just like the rest of them.

24:11.740 --> 24:15.653
Zach, and Montgomery, and Scott,
and Bryce.

24:15.780 --> 24:16.610
And Justin?

24:16.830 --> 24:18.400
Justin let him rape Jessica.

24:18.950 --> 24:20.861
Justin would give his life
to do that over.

24:20.950 --> 24:23.202
He should. He should give his life.

24:23.370 --> 24:24.359
He's your friend.

24:25.000 --> 24:25.955
He's not my friend.

24:26.960 --> 24:27.949
I was your friend.

24:29.090 --> 24:30.296
So tell me he was lying.

24:31.970 --> 24:35.462
Tell me Bryce was lying
about everything... now.

24:36.470 --> 24:38.176
Jesus, Hannah, tell me he was lying!

24:38.260 --> 24:41.218
-He told lies.
-It was all lies. All of it.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.919
Don't think about it, Clay.

24:43.480 --> 24:44.549
Just think about me.

24:46.100 --> 24:48.056
Think about touching me.

24:48.940 --> 24:52.353
Think about hugging me.
How it felt when we were close.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.159
No, no! Stop it. I don't ever want
to think about that again.

24:55.530 --> 24:57.191
Okay. Fine.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.070
Just tell me what's true.

25:02.330 --> 25:04.036
I need to know the truth.

25:07.460 --> 25:09.280
Here we are. Tape 12.

25:10.090 --> 25:13.082
If you've listened this far
and you haven't heard your name yet,

25:13.970 --> 25:16.006
well, I bet you know
exactly what's coming now.

25:17.180 --> 25:18.886
-Or maybe you don't have any idea.
-No.

25:18.970 --> 25:21.211
-No! Damn it, no! Shut up!
-Could that be true?

25:21.310 --> 25:23.596
-Don't do this! Leave me alone.
-Can a person be that Sick?

25:23.980 --> 25:25.265
-Let's ﬁnd out.
-Leave me alone!

25:25.350 --> 25:26.339
[door opens]

25:28.400 --> 25:29.219
Clay.

25:32.570 --> 25:35.107
Clay, what... what is it?

25:38.110 --> 25:39.941
[Clay crying] I can't.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.195
I can't do this.

25:47.250 --> 25:48.069
Clay, listen.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.205
Jess talked to Chle.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.201
She's gonna meet with the lawyers.

25:55.630 --> 25:56.540
We're gonna get him.

26:05.390 --> 26:08.018
[Dennis] Chle, Mrs. Rice,
our window is closing here.

26:08.770 --> 26:11.933
To be clear, testifying
that Bryce raped you on campus,

26:12.020 --> 26:14.773
you'd help support the argument
that Liberty's protection of rapists

26:14.860 --> 26:16.316
allowed more rapes to happen

26:16.400 --> 26:20.655
and refute Bryce's testimony
that he had consensual sex with Hannah.

26:21.070 --> 26:23.903
-Do you understand?
-I-- I think so.

26:24.700 --> 26:27.203
[Olivia]
You mentioned, uh, your little sister?

26:29.120 --> 26:30.451
-Amelia.
-Amelia.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.491
If you decide to testify
in that courtroom,

26:34.670 --> 26:35.955
maybe the next girl,

26:36.630 --> 26:38.712
maybe even Amelia will be safer.

26:39.180 --> 26:42.422
Chle, I know this is a lot. We know it.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.428
And I know I'm asking you
to do the thing that I couldn't do,

26:48.310 --> 26:49.436
that Hannah couldn't do.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.478
But if you could do this for all of us,

26:53.360 --> 26:55.726
whatever happens next, we have your back.

26:59.740 --> 27:02.618
It's up to you, sweetheart.
It's whatever you decide.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.699
[Mackenzie] Hey.

27:14.670 --> 27:15.489
Hey.

27:16.090 --> 27:18.752
Listen, I told one friend.

27:20.300 --> 27:25.556
I was-- I mean, I was just trying
to figure out what I did wrong...

27:28.520 --> 27:31.387
so I told one friend, and she's an asshole
and she told someone else,

27:31.480 --> 27:33.641
and it just... it got out of control.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.139
I'm sorry.

27:38.030 --> 27:38.849
[Cyrus] Mack.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.789
Then let's do it.

a bloody nose or anything.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.322
[Justin] You never hooked up with Hannah.
You would've told me.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.867
Why? Because we were best friends
and I told you everything?

28:35.920 --> 28:37.990
-[Justin] I should kill you.
-Hey, chill out.

28:38.090 --> 28:39.660

do you remember what happened next?

We... we listened to music.

And then... we, um, we started drinking...

34:51.330 --> 34:52.456
and smoking pot.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.297

being taken?

No.

[Chle] No, I...

35:28.410 --> 35:30.617
I do. I remember.

You remember what?

35:35.500 --> 35:36.455
We had sex.

35:36.840 --> 35:41.083
But you... you don't remember Bryce
asking for your consent, correct?

35:41.970 --> 35:44.541
No, I... I do. I remember that now.

35:46.510 --> 35:49.764
We were drinking,
so I had forgotten, but...

35:55.650 --> 35:56.514
but I wanted to.

Well, God fucking damn it.

36:05.780 --> 36:06.610
I believed her.

36:08.830 --> 36:11.742
I think she told us the truth
before she walked into that courtroom.

36:13.040 --> 36:13.870

36:15.880 --> 36:17.165
Somehow they got to her.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.012

if you want to.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.600
Or file separately. I'm sure they'd settle

of headlines.

42:44.720 --> 42:45.550
[Nora clears her throat]

42:45.640 --> 42:47.596
Turned and walked out
and never said anything,

42:47.730 --> 42:49.800
but you saw a whole lot of naked.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.010
And what happened with Chle?

42:54.190 --> 42:56.101
A whole lot of naked there, too.

42:58.530 --> 43:02.489
Chle's got problems, okay?
She comes from a broken home.

43:03.660 --> 43:05.867
So you had sex with her
when she was unconscious?

43:05.950 --> 43:09.158
I didn't force her to get drunk
and stoned at 4:00 in the afternoon.

43:09.250 --> 43:12.413
Oh, just like you didn't force Hannah
to get into the hot tub with you.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.330
Why do you care?
You didn't even know Hannah.

43:14.420 --> 43:18.299
Did you? Or was she just
another thing that you wanted?

43:27.770 --> 43:29.169
She got in the hot tub with me,

43:29.810 --> 43:35.180
no suit, just panties and a bra
over those very nice tits.

43:37.150 --> 43:40.984
And she looked at me like...
like she was hungry.

43:42.870 --> 43:44.406
And, yeah, I wanted her.

43:44.660 --> 43:45.479
Ijust...

43:47.620 --> 43:48.655
I just had to have her.

43:49.200 --> 43:52.112
So I took her, I turned her around,

43:53.130 --> 43:54.586
and I fucked her from behind.

43:56.000 --> 43:56.830
Hard.

43:58.380 --> 43:59.415
Until she cried.

44:00.880 --> 44:02.177
Is that what you want to hear?

44:09.430 --> 44:11.432
You've brought shame on this family.

44:11.890 --> 44:13.972
-You're a stranger in this house.
-[chuckles]

44:15.270 --> 44:16.510
Always have been, Mom.

44:26.370 --> 44:28.110
Is Mrs. Baker coming back tonight?

44:28.910 --> 44:30.195
Nah, she's gone for the day.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.956
Why don't you head home? I'll lock up.

44:34.000 --> 44:34.819
Okay.

44:36.290 --> 44:37.120
Thanks.

44:38.130 --> 44:41.258
Oh, there was a package left
for you earlier, on the counter.

44:43.760 --> 44:46.638
-Who left it?
-I don't know. Just showed up.

44:55.310 --> 44:57.221
[Justin] It wouldn't have mattered
if Chle came through.

44:57.310 --> 44:59.642
-Don't you dare blame Chle.
-No, I know, I'm just saying--

44:59.730 --> 45:00.776
She wasn't ready.

45:01.320 --> 45:03.026
She wasn't strong enough
to tell her story,

45:03.110 --> 45:05.442
-and that's not her fault.
-I know.

45:05.530 --> 45:06.736
If she says it out loud,

45:07.410 --> 45:10.652
if she points at him and says,
"He did this,"

45:10.740 --> 45:13.208
her whole world comes crashing down.

45:15.540 --> 45:18.031
Hasn't your whole world
come crashing down?

45:22.590 --> 45:24.330
I wish I could fix this, Jess.

45:25.760 --> 45:28.502
I would do anything to take
everything you've been through,

45:28.600 --> 45:30.306
-and put it on me.
-You can't.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.214
No, I can't.

45:33.560 --> 45:36.438
But you can let me point at him
and say, "He did this."

45:36.940 --> 45:39.147
["The Killing Moon" playing]

45:46.160 --> 45:48.446
Justin, it's me again.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.611
I'm gonna need you to bring my car
and meet me...

45:53.290 --> 45:54.860
meet me at the bottom of Vaughan's Hill.

45:56.250 --> 45:57.069
Um...

45:58.290 --> 45:59.370
I got something I gotta do.

46:01.550 --> 46:04.041
When I tried to climb out of the hot tub,
you grabbed my arm.

46:04.920 --> 46:08.299
You traced your fingers
down my bra strap and over my bra.

46:08.390 --> 46:11.427
I know. I know. I'm taking care of it.

46:11.510 --> 46:14.388
You pulled my underwear down and used
your body to keep me trapped there.

46:15.100 --> 46:17.227
I was frozen. I was terrified.

46:17.310 --> 46:19.187
Just-- I remember, okay?

46:20.770 --> 46:21.600
I remember.

46:23.320 --> 46:26.232
Unwillingly mine

46:27.490 --> 46:28.809

46:30.120 --> 46:33.032

46:33.830 --> 46:36.651

He will wait until

46:41.500 --> 46:45.948
You give yourself to him

Up against your will

He will wait until

47:00.770 --> 47:04.319
You give yourself to him

47:04.650 --> 47:09.565

[helicopter noise]

47:52.860 --> 47:53.690
[groans]

47:53.870 --> 47:55.735
How are you so fucking good at this?

47:55.910 --> 47:57.821
It's natural-born talent, Montgomery.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.327
And practice.
We've been playing for, like, five hours.

48:01.670 --> 48:02.489
[girl groans]

48:04.920 --> 48:05.955
What the fuck?

48:06.130 --> 48:07.245
[groans]

48:07.750 --> 48:09.661
-[Alex] Jesus!
-[Montgomery laughs]

48:09.760 --> 48:11.079
[girl grunting, struggling]

48:11.680 --> 48:14.251
-I thought everyone went home.
-[Montgomery] Yeah, me, too.

48:14.340 --> 48:16.137
[men shouting in video game]

48:16.220 --> 48:18.461
[girl grunting]

48:18.560 --> 48:19.379
Who is it?

48:21.480 --> 48:24.096
[Montgomery] Just Bryce
fucking some chick in the hot tub.

48:25.770 --> 48:27.818
Must be a desperate slut at this hour.

48:29.940 --> 48:31.146
[Montgomery] Yeah. [scoffs]

48:34.660 --> 48:35.729
You could've stopped it.

48:36.030 --> 48:37.611
I don't know what you're talking about.

48:37.700 --> 48:40.407
That night at the party. Hannah and Bryce.

48:41.000 --> 48:41.819
Please, Bryce.

48:42.210 --> 48:43.859
Hannah's dead because of us.

48:44.250 --> 48:45.285
[Hannah grunts]

49:03.730 --> 49:07.723
So, Hannah initiated
this "on-again, off-again thing"?

49:07.810 --> 49:11.689
[Bryce] Yes, she did.
She... she took me to Hickman's Bridge.

49:13.530 --> 49:14.849
[Bryce] One wrong turn...

49:15.240 --> 49:19.233
and you're plummeting down, down, down.

49:19.580 --> 49:20.399
[claps softly]

49:20.870 --> 49:21.780
Splat.

49:23.460 --> 49:24.358
Game over.

49:26.580 --> 49:27.990
Did you bring me here to murder me?

49:28.170 --> 49:30.240
[laughs] No. No, I just...

49:30.840 --> 49:33.468
I just mean we take it for granted
is all...

49:33.550 --> 49:37.634
life and how precarious it is.

49:40.560 --> 49:44.599
Coming here helps me
step out of mine sometimes.

49:47.350 --> 49:48.351
I think I get it.

49:51.860 --> 49:53.521
We should, uh... we should get back.

49:59.200 --> 50:02.863
[Bryce] Sometimes we just made out,
um, looked at the stars.

50:03.450 --> 50:04.610
Sometimes we made love.

50:13.550 --> 50:14.835
[sighs]

50:20.720 --> 50:22.256
[Hannah] Jeez, it's freezing in here.

50:22.890 --> 50:26.269
-Does this place have any heat?
-Oh, shit. Uh, no.

50:26.350 --> 50:27.180
Sorry.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.681
Here, take this.

50:31.150 --> 50:32.014
[laughs]

50:34.480 --> 50:36.812
Isn't it, like, freedom,
being on your own?

50:38.240 --> 50:39.150
Yeah, I guess.

50:39.990 --> 50:41.480
I got plenty of freedom, though.

50:41.950 --> 50:44.077
It'd be nice to have them show up
every now and then.

50:45.040 --> 50:46.325
That sounds kind of lonely.

50:47.710 --> 50:49.496
Eh, sometimes, yeah.

50:52.380 --> 50:54.871
I don't really talk about this stuff
with a lot of people.

50:56.590 --> 50:57.409
It's nice.

50:58.380 --> 50:59.620
Yeah, it is.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.794
That looks good on you.

51:03.470 --> 51:04.346
Let me get a picture.

51:04.430 --> 51:06.478
-Oh, no way. No photos.
-What?

51:06.560 --> 51:08.300
Come on. You're so beautiful.

51:10.310 --> 51:13.222
Well, I probably shouldn't pose with this.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.857
Don't want everyone to think
the new girl is a complete stoner.

51:15.940 --> 51:16.816
[laughs]

51:23.740 --> 51:25.537
So, your parents,

51:26.160 --> 51:29.209
have you ever tried to have,
like, a real conversation with them?

51:29.580 --> 51:32.663
Let them know how you feel about them
being away all the time and everything?

51:33.630 --> 51:34.836
Whoa. Um...

51:35.170 --> 51:37.411
What's the matter?
I thought we were having a good time.

51:38.340 --> 51:39.830
We are. It'sjust, um...

51:41.220 --> 51:44.804
I like you, but as a friend.

51:47.180 --> 51:49.262
[Bryce] Yeah. Okay, sure.

51:49.520 --> 51:50.589
[sighs]

51:53.020 --> 51:54.180
[Hannah gasping]

51:54.270 --> 51:55.931
[Bryce panting] Oh, yeah.

51:57.110 --> 51:57.929
[Hannah cries out]

52:08.200 --> 52:09.997
[Clay] Why were you
in the Clubhouse with him?

52:10.210 --> 52:12.997
When I tried to climb out of the hot tub,
you pulled me back in.

52:13.080 --> 52:14.877
Tell me, or I'll ask him myself.

52:15.340 --> 52:17.080
You told me we were "just having fun."

52:17.630 --> 52:20.042
I'll make him hurt. I'll make him
understand what he did.

52:20.130 --> 52:22.086
I struggled, but you were
too strong for me.

52:22.590 --> 52:25.218
You pulled my underwear down
and used your body to trap me there.

52:26.390 --> 52:27.505
Clay, what are you doing?

52:28.770 --> 52:29.759
Where did you get that?

52:29.850 --> 52:32.307
You gripped my wrists
and pushed yourself inside of me.

52:32.390 --> 52:35.052
-Get out of my way, Justin.
-Come on, Clay, this is fucking crazy.

52:35.150 --> 52:36.890
It felt like a knife cutting me open.

52:37.150 --> 52:38.435
No one's gonna get justice for her.

52:38.530 --> 52:39.565
-Hey, come on. Hey!
-Move!

52:39.820 --> 52:42.232
I begged you, "Please, Bryce,"
but you told me to relax.

52:42.320 --> 52:45.062
I talked to Jessica today.
She wants me to testify.

52:45.410 --> 52:47.696
-Bullshit. No, she doesn't.
-Yes, I swear, she does.

52:47.780 --> 52:51.739
You said you would go "nice and easy,"
but you went harder and faster.

52:51.830 --> 52:54.742
So you'll just run away
or fucking overdose again?

52:54.830 --> 52:55.706
Clay, come on.

52:55.790 --> 52:57.701
When I cried out in pain,
you grabbed my hair

52:57.790 --> 52:59.951
like the sound of my pain
made it better for you.

53:00.050 --> 53:03.213
I can't count on anyone else anymore.
I have to do this myself.

53:03.300 --> 53:06.463
You don't have to do this yourself.
We can get him tomorrow.

53:06.720 --> 53:08.506
-I need to do it now.
-[Justin] Why?

53:08.600 --> 53:12.013
I just tried to leave my body.
I tried to forget the anger and pain.

53:12.350 --> 53:14.181
-For Hannah.
-[Justin] Listen, Clay,

53:14.270 --> 53:16.056
I know you loved her, but she's gone.

53:16.230 --> 53:19.267
And going in there and hurting Bryce now
is not gonna bring her back.

53:19.650 --> 53:20.469
She's gone.

53:20.570 --> 53:22.185
[Hannah] If you're lucky,
you live a long life,

53:22.280 --> 53:24.771
and one day, your body just gives up,
and it's over.

53:25.070 --> 53:26.981
How do I make her stop? She won't stop.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.827
Make who stop? Who, Clay?
Who are you talking about?

53:29.990 --> 53:32.367
-There are two kinds of death.
-[Justin] Clay!

53:32.620 --> 53:34.497
If you're not luclq,
you die a little bit...

53:34.580 --> 53:36.992
-[Justin] Clay, come on.
-...over and over,

53:37.250 --> 53:38.877
until you realize it's too late.

53:39.170 --> 53:41.161
-[sobs]
-[Justin] Just stop. Give me the gun.

53:49.010 --> 53:50.420
What the fuck?

53:59.940 --> 54:01.680
And in that moment, it felt...

54:04.400 --> 54:06.448
it felt like I was already dead.
