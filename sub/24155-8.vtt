a little crush on me.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.284
What a sassafrass!

10:19.286 --> 10:21.486
Gotta get this on tape!

10:21.488 --> 10:23.254
Whoops!

10:25.559 --> 10:29.494
If this was all time weirdness,
I guess that memory was true.

10:29.496 --> 10:32.764
I did see my own birth.
Far out.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.333
Oh!

10:35.335 --> 10:37.902
Must be
a leftover time ghost.

10:37.904 --> 10:41.406
♪

10:41.408 --> 10:43.041
Hmm.

10:43.043 --> 10:46.411
We have to leave!

10:46.413 --> 10:48.079
We're doin' what now?

10:48.081 --> 10:49.414
It was just Clock Bear.

10:49.416 --> 10:53.051
No, I don't think
he has any money.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.453
Finn: Jake? Jake!

10:55.455 --> 10:57.689
Oh, no!
Something's happened to Jake!

10:57.691 --> 10:58.823
He could be
in grave dang--

11:01.928 --> 11:03.461
Okay, then.
