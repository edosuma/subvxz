WEBVTT

00:17.240 --> 00:18.760
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:18.840 --> 00:22.520
I will now lead you back
to the source of your fear.

00:22.640 --> 00:26.760
<i>He's lying at my feet...</i>

00:26.840 --> 00:27.760
My brother is still alive!

00:27.840 --> 00:30.000
-There's another one!
-Dirty German pig.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.400
<i>I was captured.</i>

00:31.480 --> 00:32.680
I was forced to leave Anno behind.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.200
And no trace of your brother?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.280
The train will be sent back.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.920
Including the wagon with the gold.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.800
-There is no gold in the wagon.
-There is. The wagon numbers were swapped.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.840
Wolter is meeting someone
Jänicke didn't recognize.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.000
They're talking about robbing the train,
and it says here where exactly.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.600
Milestone 127.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.320
And they'll all try to stop the train
before the border.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.680
-Who do you mean, all?
-Well, Wolter. Nyssen.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.040
Gereon!

01:00.960 --> 01:01.920
I'm stuck!

03:46.360 --> 03:47.200
Come on.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.600
Come on!

04:40.640 --> 04:41.840
Come on!

06:24.920 --> 06:27.400
Moon and sun.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.080
They're both there.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.960
Yes, it happens.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.760
Both the same size.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.160
Will you carry me all the way
back to the city?

06:49.120 --> 06:50.080
Of course.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.360
What happened?

07:11.080 --> 07:13.880
Here, boss.
The train line runs through a forest,

07:13.960 --> 07:16.040
but first we have to go
through this village.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.240
That takes too long.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.520
There. We'll go cross-country.
Through there.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.480
The tracks go around the bend.
We can take a short cut.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.360
Take good care of her.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.680
He's a better driver than me.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.120
Gereon.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.480
Be careful.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.040
I'm telling you, we should have gone left.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.400
-No, we need to go east.
-Exactly. East is to the left.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.240
-But the map is upside down.
-But why?

08:08.800 --> 08:11.120
-We would have to go backwards otherwise.
-I see.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.680
This way.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.640
-Like I said.
-Left. I said left.

08:15.720 --> 08:16.760
But you meant right.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.440
What now? Let's go.

08:34.040 --> 08:37.600
If the train runs faster than 40 km/h,
it will have already passed.

08:38.040 --> 08:38.920
But why?

08:39.240 --> 08:43.120
Because it left three hours ago
and we just passed milestone 120.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.240
But the 120 doesn't refer
to the distance to the engine shed.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.880
-What then?
-I don't know.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.160
You don't know.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.720
But you know for sure it doesn't refer
to the distance to the engine shed?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.760
-I say it hasn't passed yet.
-Boss!

08:55.640 --> 08:56.680
That's a stop sign.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.320
-Line closure.
-Like I said.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.440
When we're on the train, we have
to reckon with him at every corner.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.360
-You mean Wolter?
-And his men.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.920
-At every corner?
-I meant bend.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.440
No, you mean curve. But why would
they rob the train in a curve?

09:31.840 --> 09:32.800
Ready?

09:34.600 --> 09:35.600
Yes, sir.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.880
What's this?

09:48.320 --> 09:50.480
-Did I miss a signal?
-No idea.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.960
There is someone on the tracks.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.440
Police. Put it down.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.640
Now listen closely.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.000
No!

11:06.120 --> 11:06.960
Gereon. Gereon.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.720
Hands behind your head and lie down!

12:04.920 --> 12:06.560
On the double, gentlemen!

12:07.920 --> 12:09.400
Company, secure the train.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.160
We're looking for wagon TY 23-05.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.200
SOROKIN

15:19.880 --> 15:21.280
Everything alright out there?

15:37.680 --> 15:38.520
Your gun. Throw it to me.

16:00.040 --> 16:00.880
Get up there.

16:04.320 --> 16:05.600
You're no hero.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.200
You're a traitor.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.560
No values.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.000
No morals.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.200
No courage.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.200
This is about something else.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.240
And you...

16:24.320 --> 16:26.320
you work to rule.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.680
Like all apple polishers.

16:36.120 --> 16:36.960
God! This...

17:03.200 --> 17:04.560
This is coal.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.280
This...

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
This is...

17:19.920 --> 17:22.280
This is all garbage.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.560
Coal...

17:31.200 --> 17:33.160
Vile coal.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.600
Get up there. Now.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.240
Come out. Get down there.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.440
I want to see your hands.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.600
Henning?

18:31.600 --> 18:32.560
Czerwinski?

18:49.600 --> 18:50.440
Throw away the gun.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.680
Out now.

19:02.840 --> 19:03.680
Come down. Gas!

19:21.000 --> 19:22.120
There's a gas leak!

19:22.560 --> 19:23.480
Gas!

19:24.400 --> 19:25.240
Drive.

19:25.520 --> 19:26.440
Drive!

19:46.400 --> 19:47.240
Henning?

19:48.040 --> 19:48.920
Czerwinski?

19:57.600 --> 19:59.280
How long does the anesthesia work?

19:59.600 --> 20:03.400
-It depends. 30 to 60 minutes.
-A half hour to an hour.

20:03.920 --> 20:04.960
That's what I said.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.440
Where is Wolter?

20:09.520 --> 20:10.640
Is he down there?

20:11.880 --> 20:13.440
-No. Gone.
-Not here.

20:13.920 --> 20:14.840
Watch out.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.320
Disarm all of them.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.120
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

20:33.520 --> 20:37.480
-Hey, boss! Now what?
-Now what?

20:37.600 --> 20:40.160
You stay here! Disarm the men. Yes, sir. And you? The train is leaving.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.560
Go on, drive. Let's go. Faster.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.520
Valve. Full steam!

21:21.120 --> 21:23.400
If you pull the brake I'll shoot you both.

24:01.880 --> 24:06.520
<i>For the cowardly and insidious attack</i>
<i>on Councillor Benda and his family,</i>

24:06.600 --> 24:12.560
<i>an unknown faction of the Communist Party</i>
<i>has taken responsibility.</i>

24:13.320 --> 24:17.680
<i>The role of a maid who was arrested</i>
<i>on site is still being investigated.</i>

24:17.960 --> 24:21.640
<i>This inhuman act</i>
<i>is probably directly related</i>

24:21.720 --> 24:25.840
<i>to the Communist protesters</i>
<i>who were killed on May 1.</i>

24:26.320 --> 24:28.920
<i>The same night,</i>
<i>the police have started to chase down</i>

24:29.000 --> 24:32.960
<i>and arrest</i>
<i>insurgent elements in the city.</i>

24:33.200 --> 24:36.200
<i>The Red Terror</i>
<i>is destabilizing the republic</i>

24:36.280 --> 24:40.400
<i>and has to be fought tooth and nail,</i>
<i>says Chief of Police Zörgiebel.</i>

24:43.400 --> 24:46.000
<i>Zossen.</i>
<i>During a train accident last night,</i>

24:46.080 --> 24:48.800
<i>a tank wagon filled</i>
<i>with chemicals exploded.</i>

24:49.400 --> 24:52.800
<i>What led to the accident</i>
<i>is still completely unknown.</i>

26:06.920 --> 26:07.760
Thank you.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.960
-Miss Scheffler?
-Yes, Councillor?

26:31.160 --> 26:32.360
Away with this one.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.720
And when you're done,
have the room thoroughly fumigated.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.080
-Disinfect it.
-Yes, sir.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.040
The boss will see you now.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.160
Councillor?

27:02.840 --> 27:04.360
Happy to make your acquaintance.

27:05.160 --> 27:08.360
Congratulations on your investigative
success in your own ranks.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.720
-Thank you.
-Take a seat.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.640
Cigarette? Thank you.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.520
The events around your colleague Wolter

27:25.600 --> 27:28.640
and his illegal activities
have made me think.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.880
In these tumultuous times it's getting
more and more difficult to be able

27:31.960 --> 27:36.240
to rely on the political opinions
of even your closest colleagues, right?

27:39.920 --> 27:42.360
I was thinking
of establishing a new department.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.040
I'll call it "Internal Revision".

27:45.440 --> 27:48.080
Irregularities within our apparatus,

27:48.560 --> 27:51.480
conspicuous political behavior,
corruption, that sort of thing.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.480
I want you to be the head
of this department.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.040
Unofficially.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.400
Officially, you're still
with Homicide. Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

28:10.440 --> 28:11.360
DISTRICT COURT
MAY 1 TRIAL

28:11.440 --> 28:12.480
So help me God.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.840
I have here the memory minutes,
signed by your colleague,

28:16.920 --> 28:21.800
Inspector Wolter, Bruno,
describing the events

28:21.880 --> 28:26.280
during the demonstrations on May 1, 1929.

28:26.360 --> 28:30.960
Your colleague accuses the communists
to have shot at you and him.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.200
That's right!

28:34.560 --> 28:40.280
This contradicts all the statements
we've heard from all the other witnesses.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.840
Wait, I correct myself.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.840
From all witnesses who are not members
of the Berlin police.

28:49.360 --> 28:52.320
Since Inspector Wolter has passed away
as I can see from the file,

28:52.400 --> 28:53.840
you're the only one who was summoned.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.160
Inspector Rath.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.200
Can you confirm
your colleague's statement?

29:02.760 --> 29:06.200
Or do you want to add something
under oath today?

29:16.160 --> 29:17.200
We were shot at.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.080
That's a lie.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.360
I hereby confirm the statement
of my colleague Bruno Wolter.

29:23.080 --> 29:23.920
Liar!

29:25.000 --> 29:25.880
Liar!

29:26.160 --> 29:27.160
Murderer!

29:27.720 --> 29:31.080
The protesters opened fire on us.
We were shot at.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.080
Quiet! Quiet!

29:37.680 --> 29:38.840
Traitor!

29:50.720 --> 29:52.480
Thank you. That's enough.

29:53.840 --> 29:57.000
-Good performance. Everyone's grateful.
-Thank you.

30:16.160 --> 30:19.680
We need to go to Sorokina's flat.
We can't let that woman get away.

30:22.360 --> 30:25.000
This came for you this morning.
Department PO. -Personnel office.
-Department personnel.

30:30.280 --> 30:32.920
STATE POLICE ADMINISTRATION
BERLIN

30:34.560 --> 30:35.400
Congratulations.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.720
Your application has been accepted.
You have the job.

30:53.720 --> 30:54.920
Congratulations.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.760
Welcome to our department.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.920
Deputy Ritter.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.440
Yes, congrats.

31:06.400 --> 31:07.240
Congrats.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.720
Come on, let's go see Sorokina.

31:30.520 --> 31:34.560
Hello. Please open up
Ms. Sorokina's flat. Police.

31:34.640 --> 31:35.640
Criminal investigations.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.280
Flown out. Charlotte?

32:22.320 --> 32:23.160
Look at this.

32:25.560 --> 32:26.800
The family portrait?

32:27.600 --> 32:29.400
Old Sorokin and his family.

32:30.880 --> 32:31.920
Eight children.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.720
-So?
-Where do you see Svetlana Sorokina?

32:41.080 --> 32:42.680
The little one with the mother, right?

32:44.200 --> 32:45.160
That's a boy.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.920
Look at the face.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.960
He even has a sword.

32:50.800 --> 32:51.640
And the dress?

32:53.120 --> 32:54.080
A christening robe?

32:55.240 --> 32:56.280
You mean...

32:57.840 --> 32:59.640
the Sorokins didn't have a daughter?

33:00.520 --> 33:02.080
At least she's not in the painting.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.120
The singer told me that,

33:17.200 --> 33:20.080
as children, they were playing
with the chauffeur's daughter

33:20.720 --> 33:21.800
The family chauffeur.

33:22.920 --> 33:26.760
He later betrayed the Sorokins
to the Bolsheviks, during the revolution.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.440
The entire family was murdered.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.000
The people in this painting...

33:33.160 --> 33:34.160
They are all dead.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.480
Maybe Svetlana
is the chauffeur's daughter.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.520
That's why she knew about the gold, but...

33:51.040 --> 33:52.480
not that it was fake.

33:56.240 --> 33:57.240
There's our train.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.400
They're casting a tank wagon back there.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.560
Like our wagon.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.280
Look at this. Impossible.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.520
The vessel.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.000
The vessel itself.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.120
-Is made of...
-Of gold.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.240
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

35:01.640 --> 35:03.680
<i>I am pleased to present to you</i>

35:04.120 --> 35:07.520
the most dazzling star
that has fallen out of Russia.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.400
For the very first time in Paris,

35:09.840 --> 35:11.880
the Comtesse en Noir!

35:27.000 --> 35:29.240
<i>Twilight on Sunday</i>

35:29.320 --> 35:32.800
<i>Without sleep my life torments me</i>

35:34.480 --> 35:37.520
<i>In the storm of the shadows</i>
<i>of the past</i>

35:37.600 --> 35:40.240
<i>I won't survive the night</i>

35:42.040 --> 35:47.680
<i>A black drape of sorrow</i>
<i>has fallen from the sky</i>

35:49.960 --> 35:51.640
<i>In a white garden</i>

35:51.720 --> 35:56.080
<i>We found a gloomy forest</i>

35:59.040 --> 36:04.680
<i>I foresee that the angels</i>
<i>won't return you to me</i>

36:07.640 --> 36:14.000
<i>They know how sad it is</i>
<i>for me here without you</i>

36:15.120 --> 36:20.120
<i>On Sunday</i>

36:43.040 --> 36:47.520
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR POSITION

37:01.160 --> 37:02.000
Hey! You!

37:06.200 --> 37:07.200
Drop it!

37:09.200 --> 37:11.960
I can't stand your rocking! Drop it!

37:23.760 --> 37:25.600
-Mr. Nyssen.
-Yes?

37:26.200 --> 37:27.200
Mrs. Rath is here.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.040
<i>Don't light the candles</i>

37:35.120 --> 37:38.400
<i>Let the chants go quiet</i>

37:39.640 --> 37:42.160
<i>Everyone who knew us</i>

37:42.240 --> 37:46.120
<i>Should think that we're better off there</i>

37:46.960 --> 37:49.040
<i>Death is no dream</i>

37:49.120 --> 37:53.120
<i>I won't wait for the awakening</i>

37:55.200 --> 38:01.160
<i>All my tenderness I want to give you</i>

38:03.560 --> 38:07.560
<i>On Sunday</i>

38:10.240 --> 38:13.960
<i>On Sunday</i>

38:15.160 --> 38:20.120
<i>On Sunday</i>

39:36.920 --> 39:38.800
That's enough. Put him against the wall!

39:40.680 --> 39:42.200
On behalf of the suppressed masses,

39:42.280 --> 39:45.480
Gereon Rath is sentenced to death
for perjury.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.680
Go! Everyone leave! Go on!

40:10.320 --> 40:12.000
<i>Breathe very calmly.</i>

40:14.160 --> 40:15.160
<i>Breathe in...</i>

40:17.520 --> 40:18.920
<i>and out again.</i>

40:21.400 --> 40:22.240
Good.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.400
And when I say "now"

40:26.320 --> 40:28.480
you will open your eyes.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.240
Now.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.640
Yes, close your eyes again.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.160
Good. Good.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.120
And now delve twice as deeply
into your relaxed state than before.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.600
I'm counting backwards now.

40:55.400 --> 40:59.480
Five. And you picture a place...

41:00.240 --> 41:03.360
where you feel the most secure. Four...

41:04.280 --> 41:06.440
A place where you're safe,

41:07.720 --> 41:08.680
loved,

41:09.640 --> 41:10.760
secure.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.920
It may be in the bosom of the family.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.680
I will now take you back...

41:27.400 --> 41:28.640
to the source.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.280
To the source of your fear.

41:43.160 --> 41:46.440
<i>You are in Cologne. In your home town.</i> <i>It is the summer</i>
<i>shortly before you are drafted.</i>

42:02.360 --> 42:04.520
<i>You long for the war so much,</i>

42:04.600 --> 42:07.960
<i>you can't wait to go away</i>
<i>and leave everything behind you.</i>

42:12.800 --> 42:15.440
<i>There is the woman you love.</i>

42:17.920 --> 42:20.680
<i>But there is something</i>
<i>that keeps you apart from her.</i>

42:29.240 --> 42:30.880
<i>I will guide you...</i>

42:31.680 --> 42:33.200
<i>step by step.</i>

42:35.400 --> 42:37.000
<i>Step by step...</i>

42:38.000 --> 42:40.400
<i>all the way to the source of your fear.</i>

42:42.320 --> 42:43.960
<i>All the way to the truth.</i>

42:49.280 --> 42:51.880
<i>It is November 14, 1918,</i>

42:52.160 --> 42:53.960
<i>just before 9 a.m.</i>

42:54.600 --> 42:58.000
<i>The front line</i>
<i>between Malmaison and Laffaux.</i>

42:58.480 --> 42:59.520
Three...

43:01.080 --> 43:03.920
It is now nine minutes past nine.

43:05.880 --> 43:10.280
Despite the bad visibility,
the enemy intensifies his new attacks.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.280
On one, you will wake up.

43:36.760 --> 43:40.720
You will open your eyes and finally
cover the lie with the images of truth.

43:52.000 --> 43:52.960
Two...

43:56.920 --> 43:59.440
But you have to remember
the image of truth.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.400
Gereon!

44:19.320 --> 44:21.560
Gereon!

44:45.760 --> 44:48.080
And when you open your eyes now,

44:48.360 --> 44:50.760
your fear will be in the past.

44:53.960 --> 44:54.880
One.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.040
Do you recognize me?

45:24.920 --> 45:25.760
Anno? Yes.

45:38.960 --> 45:40.720
Get up, Gereon.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.640
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

46:29.880 --> 46:31.640
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

46:37.120 --> 46:38.800
<i>But not yet now</i>

46:44.960 --> 46:47.640
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

46:54.960 --> 46:57.520
<i>Ocean of time</i>

46:58.960 --> 47:00.800
<i>Eternal law</i>

47:02.560 --> 47:04.600
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

47:06.120 --> 47:07.400
<i>To ashes</i>

47:08.080 --> 47:09.520
<i>But not yet now</i>

47:22.080 --> 47:24.600
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

47:29.240 --> 47:31.280
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

47:36.640 --> 47:38.160
<i>But not yet now</i>

47:44.240 --> 47:47.360
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

47:54.440 --> 47:57.280
<i>Ocean of time</i>

47:58.560 --> 48:00.400
<i>Eternal law</i>

48:01.920 --> 48:04.200
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

48:07.480 --> 48:08.600
<i>To ashes</i>

48:10.680 --> 48:12.400
<i>But not yet now</i>
