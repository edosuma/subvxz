>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:35.100 --> 00:36.100
WELCOME TO LAST WEEK TONIGHT.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.200
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.467
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:38.467 --> 00:39.600
US.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.867
AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE

00:41.867 --> 00:43.367
WHITE HOUSE: STILL A BEAUTIFUL

00:43.367 --> 00:44.767
BUILDING DESPITE WHAT'S

00:44.767 --> 00:46.500
CURRENTLY HAPPENING INSIDE IT.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.400
IT'S NOT THE HOUSE'S FAULT.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.033
HASHTAG #NotTheHousesFault.

00:51.033 --> 00:52.433
WELL, ON FRIDAY, THERE WAS BIG

00:52.433 --> 00:54.133
NEWS:

00:54.133 --> 00:55.433
>> Anthony Mason: ANOTHER STAFF

00:55.433 --> 00:57.166
SHAKE-UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.900
CHIEF STRATEGIST STEVE BANNON IS

00:58.900 --> 01:06.867
OUT.

01:06.867 --> 01:07.367
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

01:07.367 --> 01:08.000
>> John: YES, STEVE BANNON IS

01:08.000 --> 01:08.633
GONE, PRESUMABLY TO SPEND MORE

01:08.633 --> 01:09.166
TIME SUCKING HIS OWN COCK.

01:09.166 --> 01:09.767
BUT HE LEAVES BEHIND A LEGACY

01:09.767 --> 01:10.867
DEFINED BY QUASI-CONSTITUTIONAL

01:10.867 --> 01:12.433
XENOPHOBIA, UNFULFILLED CAMPAIGN

01:12.433 --> 01:14.033
PROMISES, AND A DEFINITIVE

01:14.033 --> 01:15.600
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, "WHAT

01:15.600 --> 01:17.000
WOULD HAPPEN IF MARTIN SHEEN ATE

01:17.000 --> 01:20.433
NOTHING BESIDES SEA-SALT FOR A

01:20.433 --> 01:21.500
THOUSAND YEARS?"

01:21.500 --> 01:22.834
AND WHILE SHOCKING, BANNON IS

01:22.834 --> 01:24.333
JUST THE LATEST IN A STRING OF

01:24.333 --> 01:26.200
RECENT DEPARTURES:

01:26.200 --> 01:27.700
>> THIS PICTURE OF THE PRESIDENT

01:27.700 --> 01:28.934
IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH HIS TOP

01:28.934 --> 01:30.667
ADVISORS TAKEN JUST DAYS AFTER

01:30.667 --> 01:32.367
THE INAUGURATION.

01:32.367 --> 01:34.333
NOW NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

01:34.333 --> 01:36.266
MICHAEL FLYNN, GONE.

01:36.266 --> 01:37.266
PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER,

01:37.266 --> 01:38.633
GONE.

01:38.633 --> 01:43.300
CHIEF OF STAFF REINCE PREIBUS,

01:43.300 --> 01:43.834
GONE.

01:43.834 --> 01:48.834
AND FINALLY TODAY, STEVE BANNON.

01:48.834 --> 01:49.300
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

01:49.300 --> 01:49.633
>> John: WOW!

01:49.633 --> 01:50.400
HE'S SURROUNDED BY FOUR WHITE

01:50.400 --> 01:51.600
NOTHINGS AND MIKE PENCE!

01:51.600 --> 01:54.700
SO, FIVE WHITE NOTHINGS!

01:54.700 --> 01:56.200
BUT THE TRULY DEPRESSING THING

01:56.200 --> 01:57.600
ABOUT BANNON'S DEPARTURE IS HOW

01:57.600 --> 02:00.500
UTTERLY UNSATISFYING IT IS.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.300
BECAUSE YES, ONE PANDERER TO

02:02.300 --> 02:03.700
WHITE NATIONALISTS HAS LEFT THE

02:03.700 --> 02:04.900
WHITE HOUSE.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.000
THE PROBLEM IS, THE ONE HE WAS

02:06.000 --> 02:08.734
WORKING FOR IS STILL THERE.

02:08.734 --> 02:09.900
AND ON TUESDAY, TRUMP DOUBLED

02:09.900 --> 02:10.800
DOWN ON HIS REMARKS ABOUT THE

02:10.800 --> 02:11.633
GROUPS MARCHING IN

02:11.633 --> 02:14.100
CHARLOTTESVILLE LAST WEEKEND:

02:14.100 --> 02:15.000
>> Trump: NOT ALL THOSE PEOPLE

02:15.000 --> 02:17.433
WERE NEO NAZIS, BELIEVE ME.

02:17.433 --> 02:19.000
NOT ALL THOSE PEOPLE WERE WHITE

02:19.000 --> 02:21.233
SUPREMACISTS BY ANY STRETCH.

02:21.233 --> 02:22.133
YOU HAD SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE IN

02:22.133 --> 02:23.400
THAT GROUP.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.200
BUT YOU ALSO HAD PEOPLE THAT

02:25.200 --> 02:27.834
WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH

02:27.834 --> 02:33.867
SIDES.

02:33.867 --> 02:34.400
[BOOS]

02:34.400 --> 02:34.867
>> John: NO!

02:34.867 --> 02:35.567
THERE WEREN'T!

02:35.567 --> 02:36.200
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE MARCHING WITH

02:36.200 --> 02:37.467
WHITE NATIONALISTS, YOU ARE - BY

02:37.467 --> 02:38.033
DEFINITION - NOT A VERY FINE

02:38.033 --> 02:39.233
PERSON.

02:39.233 --> 02:44.567
IF MALALA YOUSAFZAI HAD TAKEN

02:44.567 --> 02:45.300
PART IN THAT RALLY, YOU'D HAVE

02:45.300 --> 02:46.834
TO SAY "OKAY: I GUESS MALALA

02:46.834 --> 02:49.233
SUCKS NOW.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.300
I'M CONFUSED, I DON'T KNOW WHY

02:50.300 --> 02:51.667
SHE'S THERE, BUT MALALA

02:51.667 --> 02:53.266
DEFINITELY SUCKS AND THAT'S THE

02:53.266 --> 02:58.300
ONLY CONCLUSION YOU CAN DRAW."

02:58.300 --> 02:58.934
NOW, THANKFULLY, CONDEMNATION OF

02:58.934 --> 02:59.800
TRUMP CAME FAST -- SOMETIMES

02:59.800 --> 03:01.667
FROM UNEXPECTED QUARTERS.

03:01.667 --> 03:02.567
>> Reporter: A KEY WHITE HOUSE

03:02.567 --> 03:04.166
ADVISORY COUNCIL OF POWERHOUSE

03:04.166 --> 03:05.533
CEOS VOTING TO DISBAND.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.667
MANY OF THOSE BUSINESS LEADERS,

03:07.667 --> 03:09.166
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

03:09.166 --> 03:10.533
SPEAKING OUT, LIKE THE CEO OF

03:10.533 --> 03:12.333
CAMPBELL'S SOUP, SAYING "RACISM

03:12.333 --> 03:14.567
AND MURDER ARE UNEQUIVOCALLY

03:14.567 --> 03:16.433
REPREHENSIBLE AND ARE NOT

03:16.433 --> 03:18.233
MORALLY EQUIVALENT TO ANYTHING

03:18.233 --> 03:19.033
ELSE THAT HAPPENED IN

03:19.033 --> 03:20.567
CHARLOTTESVILLE.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.266
>> John: WOW.

03:22.266 --> 03:23.333
WHEN YOU BECOME CEO OF

03:23.333 --> 03:24.767
CAMPBELL'S SOUP, YOU DO NOT

03:24.767 --> 03:25.934
EXPECT TO HAVE TO START YOUR

03:25.934 --> 03:28.233
PUBLIC STATEMENTS WITH THE WORDS

03:28.233 --> 03:29.667
"RACISM AND MURDER ARE

03:29.667 --> 03:32.100
UNEQUIVOCALLY REPREHENSIBLE."

03:32.100 --> 03:33.633
YOU EXPECT TO START THEM BY

03:33.633 --> 03:35.066
SAYING, "YES, WE'RE VERY SORRY,

03:35.066 --> 03:36.533
BUT AGAIN: YOU'RE THE ONE EATING

03:36.533 --> 03:39.266
CLAM CHOWDER FROM A CAN."

03:39.266 --> 03:40.934
MEANWHILE, COMMENTATORS WHO ARE

03:40.934 --> 03:42.500
USUALLY IN TRUMP'S CORNER HAD A

03:42.500 --> 03:45.166
TOUGH TIME DEFENDING HIS REMARKS

03:45.166 --> 03:46.500
-- NONE TOUGHER THAN FOX NEWS'S

03:46.500 --> 03:54.500
MELISSA FRANCIS.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.133
>> Melissa Francis:HE DIDN'T SAY

03:55.133 --> 03:55.700
THERE WERE VERY GOOD PEOPLE

03:55.700 --> 03:56.233
AMONG NEO-NAZI PROTESTERS.

03:56.233 --> 03:56.834
>> Marie Harf: "HE SAID THERE

03:56.834 --> 03:57.400
WERE VERY GOOD PEOPLE ON THE

03:57.400 --> 03:57.700
OTHER SIDE.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.300
>> Melissa Francis: THERE ARE

03:58.300 --> 03:58.934
PEOPLE THAT WERE OPPOSED TO THE

03:58.934 --> 04:00.467
STATUES...

04:00.467 --> 04:01.133
>> Marie Harf: IT WAS CLEAR WHAT

04:01.133 --> 04:01.633
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT...

04:01.633 --> 04:02.200
>> Melissa Francis: LOOK AT,

04:02.200 --> 04:02.734
BUT...CAN I TELL YOU THIS?

04:02.734 --> 04:03.300
I AM SO UNCOMFORTABLE HAVING

04:03.300 --> 04:03.700
THIS CONVERSATION.

04:03.700 --> 04:04.333
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WOMAN SAID

04:04.333 --> 04:05.000
BEFORE THIS, BECAUSE I KNOW

04:05.000 --> 04:06.300
WHAT'S IN MY HEART.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.166
AND I KNOW THAT I DON'T THINK

04:08.166 --> 04:10.133
ANYONE IS DIFFERENT, BETTER, OR

04:10.133 --> 04:11.266
WORSE BASED ON THE COLOR OF

04:11.266 --> 04:12.233
THEIR SKIN, BUT I FEEL LIKE

04:12.233 --> 04:13.567
THERE IS NOTHING ANY OF US CAN

04:13.567 --> 04:14.600
SAY RIGHT NOW WITHOUT BEING

04:14.600 --> 04:16.967
JUDGED.

04:16.967 --> 04:18.600
>> John: WELL, HERE'S A TIP: IF

04:18.600 --> 04:19.633
YOU'RE GETTING EMOTIONALLY

04:19.633 --> 04:21.533
OVERWHELMED AND FEELING JUDGED,

04:21.533 --> 04:23.133
FOR DEFENDING TRUMP IN HIS "NAZI

04:23.133 --> 04:25.033
SYMPATHIZER" PHASE -- JUST STOP

04:25.033 --> 04:27.166
FUCKING DOING IT.

04:27.166 --> 04:34.333
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.033
NO ONE IS MAKING YOU DO IT.

04:37.033 --> 04:37.834
ALSO, AND I CAN'T STRESS THIS

04:37.834 --> 04:38.533
ENOUGH, HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO

04:38.533 --> 04:39.100
MAKE THIS ABOUT YOU?

04:39.100 --> 04:40.233
IT WAS ALSO FASCINATING TO WATCH

04:40.233 --> 04:42.567
TRUMP'S OWN PARTY TRY NOT TO

04:42.567 --> 04:44.333
DEAL WITH WHAT HE SAID.

04:44.333 --> 04:45.367
TAKE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER

04:45.367 --> 04:46.467
MITCH MCCONNELL, WHOSE OFFICE

04:46.467 --> 04:47.500
INITIALLY RESPONDED WITH A

04:47.500 --> 04:49.333
STATEMENT THAT "HE HAD NO NEW

04:49.333 --> 04:50.967
RESPONSE TO TRUMP'S NEWS

04:50.967 --> 04:52.700
CONFERENCE."

04:52.700 --> 04:53.533
ALTHOUGH BY WEDNESDAY, A NEW

04:53.533 --> 04:57.266
RUMOR STARTED MAKING THE ROUNDS:

04:57.266 --> 04:58.166
>> Reporter: SOURCES CLOSE TO

04:58.166 --> 04:58.834
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH

04:58.834 --> 04:59.667
MCCONNELL DESCRIBE HIM AS "VERY

04:59.667 --> 05:01.900
CONCERNED AND VERY UPSET."

05:01.900 --> 05:04.033
MCCONNELL'S OFFICE DENIES THAT.

05:04.033 --> 05:06.333
>> John: YES, MITCH MCCONNELL

05:06.333 --> 05:08.266
HAD THE MORAL COURAGE TO DENY

05:08.266 --> 05:10.233
ANONYMOUS SOURCES WHO SAID HE

05:10.233 --> 05:12.667
HAD SOME MORAL COURAGE.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.166
"I WILL NOT STAND IDLY BY WHILE

05:14.166 --> 05:15.633
PEOPLE DRAG MY NAME OUT OF THE

05:15.633 --> 05:17.000
MUD!

05:17.000 --> 05:18.367
LEAVE MY NAME IN THE MUD WHERE

05:18.367 --> 05:20.767
IT BELONGS!"

05:20.767 --> 05:22.066
OTHERS TRIED TO THREAD THE

05:22.066 --> 05:24.867
NEEDLE, CONDEMNING THE NAZIS

05:24.867 --> 05:26.300
WITHOUT EXPLICITLY MENTIONING

05:26.300 --> 05:27.367
THE PRESIDENT.

05:27.367 --> 05:29.033
PAUL RYAN, A MAN WHOSE SPINE RAN

05:29.033 --> 05:31.233
AWAY FROM HOME TEN YEARS AGO AND

05:31.233 --> 05:32.734
IS NOW LIVING ON A SPINE COMMUNE

05:32.734 --> 05:34.500
IN NORTHERN VERMONT.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.100
HE TWEETED THAT "WHITE SUPREMACY

05:36.100 --> 05:37.700
IS REPULSIVE", BUT DIDN'T

05:37.700 --> 05:39.533
MENTION TRUMP.

05:39.533 --> 05:40.734
AND COME ON.

05:40.734 --> 05:42.266
YOU CAN NAME HIM.

05:42.266 --> 05:43.734
HE'S NOT VOLDEMORT.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.333
HE'S JUST A TERRIFYING ENTITY

05:45.333 --> 05:46.467
WHO VICIOUSLY ATTACKS HIS

05:46.467 --> 05:47.900
ENEMIES, AND JUDGES PEOPLE BASED

05:47.900 --> 05:49.000
ON HIS BIRTH RIGHT AND YOU KNOW

05:49.000 --> 05:50.533
WHAT- I HEAR IT NOW.

05:50.533 --> 05:53.533
I HEAR IT.

05:53.533 --> 05:54.533
AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY NO

05:54.533 --> 05:55.633
REPUBLICANS CONDEMNED HIM BY

05:55.633 --> 05:56.600
NAME.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.934
SOME DID.

05:57.934 --> 05:58.734
>> Anchor: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

05:58.734 --> 05:59.500
JUST HOW MANY REPUBLICAN

05:59.500 --> 06:00.400
LAWMAKERS HAVE CALLED THE

06:00.400 --> 06:02.000
PRESIDENT OUT BY NAME OVER HIS

06:02.000 --> 06:03.333
RESPONSE TO CHARLOTTESVILLE.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.834
NOW, THIS IS REALLY ONLY A

06:04.834 --> 06:06.734
HANDFUL OF THE ROUGHLY 300

06:06.734 --> 06:10.333
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.533
>> John: OH, THAT GRAPHIC WAS

06:11.533 --> 06:13.533
ACTUALLY GENEROUS -- CNN

06:13.533 --> 06:14.200
MISTAKENLY PADDED IT OUT WITH

06:14.200 --> 06:15.166
JOHN KASICH, WHO ISN'T EVEN A

06:15.166 --> 06:16.433
MEMBER OF CONGRESS, AND JEB

06:16.433 --> 06:17.834
BUSH, WHO HOLDS NO GOVERNMENT

06:17.834 --> 06:20.166
POSITION AT ALL.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.200
HE'S CURRENTLY -- AND THIS IS

06:21.200 --> 06:22.467
TRUE -- RUNNING HIS OWN

06:22.467 --> 06:25.000
FROZEN YOGURT SHOP IN ORLANDO.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.033
APPARENTLY, THEIR TROPICAL MANGO

06:26.033 --> 06:27.467
FLAVOR IS...

06:27.467 --> 06:28.533
FINE.

06:28.533 --> 06:29.834
IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE YOUR

06:29.834 --> 06:30.800
LIFE.

06:30.800 --> 06:35.166
IT'S FINE.

06:35.166 --> 06:36.166
THE FACT IS, AFTER THE PRESIDENT

06:36.166 --> 06:38.100
OF THE UNITED STATES IMPLIED

06:38.100 --> 06:39.667
THAT GOOD PEOPLE WERE MARCHING

06:39.667 --> 06:41.600
WITH NAZIS, THE OVERWHELMING

06:41.600 --> 06:43.233
MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS OPTED

06:43.233 --> 06:44.967
NOT TO CONDEMN HIM.

06:44.967 --> 06:46.433
BY OUR COUNT, OUT OF 292

06:46.433 --> 06:48.633
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,

06:48.633 --> 06:51.266
ONLY AROUND 54 COULD BE BOTHERED

06:51.266 --> 06:52.400
TO UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMN TRUMP

06:52.400 --> 06:53.600
BY NAME.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.033
THAT'S LESS THAN 20 PERCENT!

06:55.033 --> 06:56.567
AND THE PROBLEM WITH NOT

06:56.567 --> 06:58.433
MENTIONING HIM IS, THAT SUGGESTS

06:58.433 --> 06:59.667
HE IS NOT A KEY PART OF THE

06:59.667 --> 07:01.333
PROBLEM HERE.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.467
SO IN THE WORDS OF THE POETS

07:03.467 --> 07:05.700
BEYONCE AND THE OTHER ONES: "SAY

07:05.700 --> 07:08.233
HIS NAME, SAY HIS NAME.

07:08.233 --> 07:09.934
GO RIGHT ON TO FOX NEWS.

07:09.934 --> 07:12.066
SAY DONALD I CONDEMN YOU.

07:12.066 --> 07:15.300
IF YOU AIN'T RUNNIN' GAME."

07:15.300 --> 07:16.500
SO ALTHOUGH THIS WEEK HAS BEEN

07:16.500 --> 07:17.467
REPEATEDLY CALLED A TURNING

07:17.467 --> 07:19.033
POINT, MUCH THOUGH I'D LOVE TO

07:19.033 --> 07:21.734
BELIEVE THAT, I DON'T SEE IT.

07:21.734 --> 07:23.100
BECAUSE EVERY DAY HAS FELT LIKE

07:23.100 --> 07:24.266
A TURNING POINT.

07:24.266 --> 07:25.333
WE'RE NOT SO MUCH TURNING

07:25.333 --> 07:27.600
ANYMORE AS SPINNING.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.100
WE'RE BASICALLY ON A CAROUSEL

07:29.100 --> 07:30.867
THAT WON'T STOP, WE'VE ALL

07:30.867 --> 07:31.667
VOMITED SO MUCH THERE'S NOTHING

07:31.667 --> 07:33.100
LEFT TO THROW UP, AND THERE'S NO

07:33.100 --> 07:34.433
WAY TO GET OFF, BECAUSE AN

07:34.433 --> 07:36.100
UNSTABLE RACE-BAITING CARNY IS

07:36.100 --> 07:38.600
OPERATING THE CONTROLS.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.500
AND WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GO

07:39.500 --> 07:40.967
THROUGH A LOT MORE BEFORE THE

07:40.967 --> 07:42.166
REPUBLICANS EVER DECIDE TO DO

07:42.166 --> 07:43.166
ANYTHING.

07:43.166 --> 07:44.567
BECAUSE THE HARD TRUTH IS,

07:44.567 --> 07:46.433
NOTHING IS REALLY GOING TO

07:46.433 --> 07:48.266
CHANGE IN THE WHITE HOUSE UNTIL

07:48.266 --> 07:50.133
ONE MORE PERSON IN THAT PHOTO

07:50.133 --> 07:52.667
FINALLY GETS SHOWN THE DOOR.

07:52.667 --> 07:59.900
AND NOW, THIS.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.433
>> AND NOW, LOCAL NEWS ANSWERS

08:02.433 --> 08:04.600
THE QUESTION, SHOULD YOU STARE

08:04.600 --> 08:05.000
AT THE SUN?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.633
SPEAK UP I KNOW IT'S BEEN PRETTY

08:06.633 --> 08:08.834
WELL ESTABLISHED THAT YOU SHOULD

08:08.834 --> 08:10.734
NEVER LOOK DIRECTLY AS THE SUN.

08:10.734 --> 08:12.166
>> YOU'LL RISK PERMANENT EYE

08:12.166 --> 08:14.100
DAMAGE IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUN

08:14.100 --> 08:15.467
WITHOUT PROPER EYE PROTECTION.

08:15.467 --> 08:17.500
>> PEERED THROUGH A DARK BEER

08:17.500 --> 08:19.333
BOTTLE?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.300
WRONG.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.333
SPRAY PAINT GLASS?

08:21.333 --> 08:22.333
DON'T DO IT.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.500
>> NEVER, EVER, DO NOT LOOK AT

08:24.500 --> 08:25.500
THE SUN LIKE THIS.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.300
>> WE CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.

08:27.300 --> 08:28.600
IT IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS TO LOOK

08:28.600 --> 08:29.133
AT THE SUN.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.700
>> YOU CANNOT LOOK AT THE SUN OR

08:30.700 --> 08:32.567
ELSE WE'LL BE TAKING A TRIP TO

08:32.567 --> 08:33.300
THE HOSPITAL.

08:33.300 --> 08:34.333
>> YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO STARE

08:34.333 --> 08:35.633
RIGHT AT THE SUN UNLESS YOU HATE

08:35.633 --> 08:36.333
YOUR EYES.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.667
>> BE WARNED, YOU COULD GO BLIND

08:38.667 --> 08:40.300
>> YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GO BLIND

08:40.300 --> 08:41.934
, BUT IT COULD CAUSE

08:41.934 --> 08:42.800
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO YOUR EYE

08:42.800 --> 08:44.400
ACCORDING TO MY OPTOMETRIST.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.734
>> THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF TIME IT

08:45.734 --> 08:47.300
SAFE TO LOOK AT THE SUN.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.533
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE CENTER A

08:49.533 --> 08:50.967
TELESCOPE YOU'LL LOSE YOUR I

08:50.967 --> 08:52.133
PRETTY MUCH INSTANTLY.

08:52.133 --> 08:54.233
>> DO NOT STARE AT THE SUN.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.600
>> OBVIOUSLY DON'T STARE AT THE

08:55.600 --> 08:55.967
SUN.

08:55.967 --> 08:58.500
>> DON'T STARE AT THE SUN.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.500
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I WANT US

09:00.500 --> 09:01.700
THEY HAD, FOLKS.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.500
>> DO NOT LOOK AT THE SUN.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.734
>> DESPITE ALL WARNINGS,

09:04.734 --> 09:05.834
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING

09:05.834 --> 09:07.300
ABOUT A YEAR, YOU'RE GOING TO

09:07.300 --> 09:08.567
LOOK STRAIGHT INTO THE SUN?

09:08.567 --> 09:14.133
>> I'M AFRAID I AM, YES.

09:14.133 --> 09:14.667
>> John: MOVING ON.

09:14.667 --> 09:15.300
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

09:15.300 --> 09:16.000
NUCLEAR WASTE.

09:16.000 --> 09:16.600
THE WORST TYPE OF GARBAGE FOR

09:16.600 --> 09:18.100
RACCOONS TO GET INTO.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.467
IT'S A SUBSTANCE WE ALL KNOW IS

09:19.467 --> 09:20.600
DANGEROUS, THANKS TO MOVIES LIKE

09:20.600 --> 09:22.333
THIS:

09:22.333 --> 09:23.667
>> THEY TORMENTED HIM UNTIL HE

09:23.667 --> 09:25.567
HAD A HORRIFYING ACCIDENT AND

09:25.567 --> 09:26.767
FELL INTO A VAT OF NUCLEAR

09:26.767 --> 09:28.200
WASTE.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.667
MELVIN BECAME THE TOXIC AVENGER!

09:31.667 --> 09:34.266
THE FIRST SUPERHERO BORN OUT OF

09:34.266 --> 09:35.667
NUCLEAR WASTE.

09:35.667 --> 09:39.467
HIS FACE IS SO TERRIFYING, WE

09:39.467 --> 09:43.800
CAN'T SHOW IT TO YOU NOW.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.433
YOU'LL HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE FOR

09:44.433 --> 09:44.734
YOURSELF.

09:44.734 --> 09:45.467
>> John: YOU REALLY DON'T NEED

09:45.467 --> 09:47.100
TO SEE THE MOVIE, BECAUSE HIS

09:47.100 --> 09:48.767
FACE ISN'T THAT TERRIFYING.

09:48.767 --> 09:51.166
THIS IS IT.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.166
IT'S SO UGLY, IT'S ALMOST CUTE

09:52.166 --> 09:53.734
AGAIN.

09:53.734 --> 09:55.000
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE MELTED A

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
CANDLE SHAPED LIKE A PUG.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.934
THE POINT IS, NUCLEAR WASTE, THE

09:59.934 --> 10:01.767
RADIOACTIVE AND TOXIC BYPRODUCTS

10:01.767 --> 10:03.300
FROM MAKING NUCLEAR ENERGY AND

10:03.300 --> 10:04.734
WEAPONS, IS A SERIOUS HEALTH

10:04.734 --> 10:05.900
HAZARD.

10:05.900 --> 10:08.166
AND AMERICA HAS A LOT OF IT.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.767
>> Reporter: THERE ARE MORE THAN

10:09.767 --> 10:11.934
71,000 TONS OF NUCLEAR WASTE

10:11.934 --> 10:13.367
STRANDED AT THE NATION'S 104

10:13.367 --> 10:14.567
REACTORS.

10:14.567 --> 10:15.800
PUT ALL THOSE SPENT FUEL RODS

10:15.800 --> 10:18.166
TOGETHER AND YOU GET A PILE AS

10:18.166 --> 10:19.667
BIG AS A FOOTBALL FIELD AND MORE

10:19.667 --> 10:22.166
THAN TWENTY FEET TALL.

10:22.166 --> 10:23.133
>> John: OR YOU COULD PUT THEM

10:23.133 --> 10:24.000
IN A PILE AS BIG AS TWO FOOTBALL

10:24.000 --> 10:25.934
FIELDS AND TEN FEET TALL, OR

10:25.934 --> 10:27.467
HALF A FOOTBALL FIELD AND FORTY

10:27.467 --> 10:29.333
FEET TALL, OR TWENTY FOOTBALL

10:29.333 --> 10:31.000
FIELDS ONE FOOT TALL.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.166
THE POINT IS, WE HAVE A LOT OF

10:32.166 --> 10:33.367
NUCLEAR WASTE AND IT IS VERY FUN

10:33.367 --> 10:36.066
TO PLAY WITH.

10:36.066 --> 10:37.433
AND THAT'S JUST THE WASTE FROM

10:37.433 --> 10:38.834
NUCLEAR ENERGY.

10:38.834 --> 10:39.967
WE ALSO HAVE MORE THAN 100

10:39.967 --> 10:41.300
MILLION GALLONS OF HAZARDOUS

10:41.300 --> 10:42.567
LIQUID WASTE FROM PRODUCING

10:42.567 --> 10:43.800
WEAPONS.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.800
AND YOU MAY LIVE CLOSER TO

10:44.800 --> 10:46.767
NUCLEAR WASTE THAN YOU THINK.

10:46.767 --> 10:48.433
ONE OUT OF THREE AMERICANS LIVE

10:48.433 --> 10:50.533
WITHIN 50 MILES OF HIGH-LEVEL

10:50.533 --> 10:51.834
NUCLEAR WASTE.

10:51.834 --> 10:53.333
SOME OF WHICH, LIKE PLUTONIUM,

10:53.333 --> 10:55.066
IS LETHALLY DANGEROUS, AND WILL

10:55.066 --> 10:57.100
BE AROUND FOR AN INCREDIBLY LONG

10:57.100 --> 10:58.800
TIME.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.133
>> EVEN MICROSCOPIC AMOUNTS OF

11:00.133 --> 11:01.667
PLUTONIUM, IF INGESTED, ARE

11:01.667 --> 11:03.400
DEADLY.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.400
>> Casey Gadbury: ONE OF THE

11:04.400 --> 11:06.400
CHARACTERISTICS OF IT IS IT HAS

11:06.400 --> 11:08.033
AN EXTREMELY LONG HALF-LIFE.

11:08.033 --> 11:09.300
PLUTONIUM 239 FOR EXAMPLE HAS A

11:09.300 --> 11:10.500
HALF-LIFE OF ABOUT TWENTY-FOUR

11:10.500 --> 11:12.400
THOUSAND YEARS.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.233
>> John: YEAH, 24,000 YEARS.

11:14.233 --> 11:14.900
AND THAT JUST SCRATCHES THE

11:14.900 --> 11:15.934
SURFACE.

11:15.934 --> 11:17.433
IT TAKES TEN HALF-LIVES FOR

11:17.433 --> 11:19.800
PLUTONIUM TO BECOME HARMLESS.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.467
SO 240,000 YEARS.

11:22.467 --> 11:23.567
A UNIT OF TIME MORE COMMONLY

11:23.567 --> 11:27.367
KNOWN AS ONE "ENGLISH PATIENT."

11:27.367 --> 11:28.500
AND AS ANY ADULT WITH AN

11:28.500 --> 11:29.734
AMERICAN GIRL DOLL COLLECTION

11:29.734 --> 11:31.000
EVENTUALLY FINDS OUT, IF YOU

11:31.000 --> 11:32.133
WANT TO KEEP SOMETHING AROUND

11:32.133 --> 11:33.600
FOR A DISTURBINGLY LONG TIME,

11:33.600 --> 11:35.400
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND AN

11:35.400 --> 11:37.033
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO PUT IT.

11:37.033 --> 11:38.467
"I CAN'T LIVE WITH YOUR MURDER

11:38.467 --> 11:40.500
DOLLS ANYMORE!

11:40.500 --> 11:42.700
FELICITY STARES AT ME WHILE I

11:42.700 --> 11:49.467
SLEEP!"

11:49.467 --> 11:52.166
SHE STARES AT ME!

11:52.166 --> 11:57.033
SHE STARES, UNBLINKING!"

11:57.033 --> 11:57.600
AND LOOK, I'M NOT THE FIRST

11:57.600 --> 11:58.133
PERSON TO MAKE THIS POINT.

11:58.133 --> 11:58.734
LOOK AT THIS NEWS REPORT FROM

11:58.734 --> 11:59.100
1990.

11:59.100 --> 11:59.633
>> Reporter: ALMOST HALF A

11:59.633 --> 12:00.400
CENTURY AFTER NUCLEAR POWER WAS

12:00.400 --> 12:00.967
HARNESSED, THERE STILL IS NO

12:00.967 --> 12:01.600
AGREEMENT ON WHERE TO STORE THE

12:01.600 --> 12:01.800
WASTE.

12:01.800 --> 12:02.400
WE HAVE BUILT THE HOUSE, SAID

12:02.400 --> 12:03.000
ONE CRITIC, AND FORGOTTEN THE

12:03.000 --> 12:04.300
TOILETS.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.734
>> John: A HOME WITH NO TOILETS,

12:06.734 --> 12:07.967
OR AS A REALTOR SELLING A

12:07.967 --> 12:08.934
BROOKLYN LOFT IS CALLING IT

12:08.934 --> 12:10.000
RIGHT NOW, "ARTISANAL

12:10.000 --> 12:12.367
COMPOSTING."

12:12.367 --> 12:13.700
"YOU'RE SUGGESTING I SHIT IN

12:13.700 --> 12:15.300
THAT POTTED PLANT, AND YOU AND I

12:15.300 --> 12:16.967
BOTH KNOW THAT I'LL DO IT,

12:16.967 --> 12:17.834
BECAUSE THIS IS CONVENIENT TO

12:17.834 --> 12:19.300
PUBLIC TRANSIT, AND IT HAS BOTH

12:19.300 --> 12:22.200
NORTHERN AND EASTERN EXPOSURES."

12:22.200 --> 12:24.066
WELL, IT'S BEEN 27 YEARS SINCE

12:24.066 --> 12:25.700
THAT CLIP AND OUR COUNTRY STILL

12:25.700 --> 12:28.200
DOESN'T HAVE A NUCLEAR TOILET.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.367
AND THAT'S OUR SUBJECT TONIGHT:

12:30.367 --> 12:32.533
WHY DO WE NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR

12:32.533 --> 12:33.633
TOILET?

12:33.633 --> 12:34.633
AND IT'S ACTUALLY EASY TO

12:34.633 --> 12:35.500
UNDERSTAND HOW WE GOT INTO THIS

12:35.500 --> 12:37.700
SITUATION: DURING WORLD WAR TWO,

12:37.700 --> 12:38.967
WE RUSHED TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR

12:38.967 --> 12:40.300
WEAPONS, BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING

12:40.300 --> 12:41.667
TO DEFEAT THE NAZIS, WHO -- FUN

12:41.667 --> 12:42.667
FACT -- PRETTY MUCH ALL

12:42.667 --> 12:44.266
AMERICANS AGREED WERE BAD AT THE

12:44.266 --> 12:47.834
TIME.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.934
THE THING IS, WE DIDN'T REALLY

12:49.934 --> 12:51.367
HAVE A PLAN FOR WHAT TO DO WITH

12:51.367 --> 12:53.033
ALL THE RADIOACTIVE BYPRODUCTS

12:53.033 --> 12:54.734
THAT WE PRODUCED.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.033
AND THIS INITIALLY LED US TO

12:56.033 --> 12:57.467
SOME MINDBLOWINGLY STUPID

12:57.467 --> 12:58.367
SOLUTIONS.

12:58.367 --> 12:59.467
FOR INSTANCE, FOR YEARS, WE

12:59.467 --> 13:01.333
ACTUALLY DID THIS:

13:01.333 --> 13:02.300
>> Jerry Whalen: THEY LOADED

13:02.300 --> 13:04.233
THE RADIOACTIVE WASTE AND IT WAS

13:04.233 --> 13:06.967
IN BARRELS, 55 GALLON BARRELS OF

13:06.967 --> 13:09.800
RADIOACTIVE WASTE WITH CONCRETE

13:09.800 --> 13:14.300
POURED OVER IT.

13:14.300 --> 13:14.900
>> Robert Birsic: IT'S FUNNY,

13:14.900 --> 13:15.500
THE OCEAN DON'T GLOW OUT THERE

13:15.500 --> 13:18.000
OUTSIDE OF RED BANK, NEW JERSEY.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.467
REALLY 'CAUSE WE DUMPED A LOT OF

13:19.467 --> 13:22.300
BARRELS OUT THERE.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.834
>> John: IT'S TRUE: WE DIDN'T

13:23.834 --> 13:25.000
JUST DUMP BARRELS OF RADIOACTIVE

13:25.000 --> 13:26.300
WASTE IN THE OCEAN, WE DID IT

13:26.300 --> 13:29.500
OFF THE COAST OF NEW JERSEY.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.633
THAT'S SO HORRIFYING, I'M

13:30.633 --> 13:32.734
SURPRISED "JERSEY SHORE" WAS THE

13:32.734 --> 13:34.633
TITLE OF A LIGHTHEARTED MTV

13:34.633 --> 13:35.800
SERIES AND NOT THE NAME OF A

13:35.800 --> 13:37.867
HARROWING DOCUMENTARY.

13:37.867 --> 13:38.834
"AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF

13:38.834 --> 13:40.667
CHILDREN WAS BORN WITHOUT

13:40.667 --> 13:42.333
THUMBS, A PHENOMENON KNOWN TO

13:42.333 --> 13:46.100
LOCALS AS...THE SITUATION."

13:46.100 --> 13:47.667
AND INCIDENTALLY: NOT ALL OF

13:47.667 --> 13:49.433
THOSE BARRELS SANK.

13:49.433 --> 13:51.133
IN FACT, IN 1957, WHEN TWO

13:51.133 --> 13:53.033
BARRELS WERE CAUGHT FLOATING OFF

13:53.033 --> 13:54.367
THE SHORE, NAVAL AIRCRAFT WERE

13:54.367 --> 13:56.033
SUMMONED TO STRAFE THEM WITH

13:56.033 --> 13:56.834
MACHINE-GUN FIRE UNTIL THEY

13:56.834 --> 13:58.633
SANK.

13:58.633 --> 13:59.800
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:59.800 --> 14:00.667
THEY SHOT BARRELS FULL OF

14:00.667 --> 14:04.400
NUCLEAR WASTE WITH MACHINE GUNS.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.433
THAT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST

14:05.433 --> 14:06.033
TERRIFYING SENTENCES EVER SAID

14:06.033 --> 14:07.266
OUT LOUD, RIGHT AFTER

14:07.266 --> 14:08.133
"DONALD TRUMP IS THE PRESIDENT

14:08.133 --> 14:10.567
NOW" AND "WAIT, WASN'T FELICITY

14:10.567 --> 14:12.033
ON A DIFFERENT SHELF WHEN WE

14:12.033 --> 14:15.066
WENT TO BED LAST NIGHT?"

14:15.066 --> 14:19.166
FELICITY IS A WAKING NIGHTMARE.

14:19.166 --> 14:22.834
ALTHOUGH TOSSING BARRELFULS OF

14:22.834 --> 14:24.333
NUCLEAR WASTE INTO THE OCEAN AND

14:24.333 --> 14:25.367
SHOOTING THEM WITH MACHINE GUNS

14:25.367 --> 14:27.166
IS ACTUALLY PREFERABLE TO AT

14:27.166 --> 14:29.100
LEAST ONE OTHER IDEA THAT WAS

14:29.100 --> 14:31.000
THANKFULLY REJECTED:

14:31.000 --> 14:32.967
BLASTING IT INTO SPACE.

14:32.967 --> 14:34.367
A CONCEPT WITH A PRETTY CLEAR

14:34.367 --> 14:36.834
FLAW:

14:36.834 --> 14:37.433
>> Allison MacFarlane:

14:37.433 --> 14:38.400
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T HAVE A

14:38.400 --> 14:41.567
GREAT RECORD WITH GETTING

14:41.567 --> 14:45.300
ROCKETS OUT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.567
IF ANY ONE OF THEM BLEW UP, THAT

14:46.567 --> 14:49.100
WOULD BASICALLY CONTAMINATE A

14:49.100 --> 14:52.066
LARGE PORTION OF THE EARTH

14:52.066 --> 14:57.567
WITH-WITH RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,

14:57.567 --> 14:58.633
SO THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A GREAT

14:58.633 --> 15:00.934
IDEA.

15:00.934 --> 15:01.834
>> John: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:01.834 --> 15:05.233
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A GREAT IDEA

15:05.233 --> 15:06.867
A GREAT IDEA WOULD BE FILLING

15:06.867 --> 15:09.033
THE ROCKETS UP WITH CONFETTI, SO

15:09.033 --> 15:10.266
THAT WAY IF THERE'S A HORRIFIC

15:10.266 --> 15:13.900
ACCIDENT, THERE'S ALSO A PARTY.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.133
OVER THE YEARS, WE'VE DUMPED

15:15.133 --> 15:16.467
NUCLEAR WASTE ALL OVER THE

15:16.467 --> 15:17.967
COUNTRY, AND IN MANY PLACES,

15:17.967 --> 15:19.166
THERE HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENING

15:19.166 --> 15:20.166
LEAKS.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.233
TAKE THE SAVANNAH RIVER SITE IN

15:21.233 --> 15:22.633
SOUTH CAROLINA, WHERE WASTE FROM

15:22.633 --> 15:24.166
POORLY STORED MATERIAL LEAKED

15:24.166 --> 15:25.600
INTO THE GROUNDWATER.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.867
AND JUST WATCH THIS ALARMINGLY

15:26.867 --> 15:28.367
LAID-BACK MAN EXPLAIN THE

15:28.367 --> 15:30.533
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT:

15:30.533 --> 15:31.133
>> Tom Clements: THERE ARE

15:31.133 --> 15:31.734
RADIOACTIVE ALLIGATORS ON THE

15:31.734 --> 15:34.834
SITE.

15:34.834 --> 15:35.633
RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS ARE IN THE

15:35.633 --> 15:39.700
SEDIMENTS.

15:39.700 --> 15:40.734
IT'S GONNA GO UP THE FOOD CHAIN

15:40.734 --> 15:42.967
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE

15:42.967 --> 15:45.633
RADIOACTIVE ALLIGATORS.

15:45.633 --> 15:46.734
>> John: YEAH!

15:46.734 --> 15:48.033
RADIOACTIVE ALLIGATORS!

15:48.033 --> 15:50.133
THEY EVEN HAVE NAMES:

15:50.133 --> 15:52.266
TRITAGATOR AND DIOXINATOR -

15:52.266 --> 15:53.033
AFTER TWO OF THE WASTES THAT

15:53.033 --> 15:54.300
POISONED THEM.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.800
AND THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

15:55.800 --> 15:56.633
BECAUSE IF I HAD TO GIVE THEM

15:56.633 --> 15:58.100
NAMES, I'D HAVE PROBABLY GONE

15:58.100 --> 15:59.867
WITH "AHHHHHHHH HOLY SHIT A

15:59.867 --> 16:02.500
FUCKING RADIOACTIVE ALLIGATOR"

16:02.500 --> 16:03.667
AND "OH NO, FUCK ME, THERE'S

16:03.667 --> 16:04.800
ANOTHER ONE WHAT NIGHTMARE HATH

16:04.800 --> 16:08.300
GOD WROUGHT?"

16:08.300 --> 16:09.433
AND IT'S NOT JUST REPTILES

16:09.433 --> 16:10.633
WHO'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY NUCLEAR

16:10.633 --> 16:11.467
WASTE.

16:11.467 --> 16:12.600
RESEARCHERS ARE NOW STUDYING AN

16:12.600 --> 16:13.734
AREA IN NORTH ST. LOUIS COUNTY,

16:13.734 --> 16:14.967
MISSOURI WHERE TONS OF WASTE

16:14.967 --> 16:15.867
FROM THE MANHATTAN PROJECT WAS

16:15.867 --> 16:18.133
IMPROPERLY STORED, SOME NEAR A

16:18.133 --> 16:19.467
CREEK THAT WINDS THROUGH

16:19.467 --> 16:21.266
RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES.

16:21.266 --> 16:22.800
AND PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE HAVE

16:22.800 --> 16:25.433
NOTICED SOME ALARMING TRENDS.

16:25.433 --> 16:26.600
>> I GOT ON FACEBOOK IN ORDER TO

16:26.600 --> 16:27.533
RECONNECT WITH PEOPLE FROM HIGH

16:27.533 --> 16:30.333
SCHOOL, AND WE STARTED NOTICING

16:30.333 --> 16:33.767
THAT SO MANY OF US WERE SICK.

16:33.767 --> 16:35.133
WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT THE

16:35.133 --> 16:36.734
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

16:36.734 --> 16:38.800
OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZES AROUND 21

16:38.800 --> 16:40.834
CANCERS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE

16:40.834 --> 16:43.033
TO IONIZING RADIATION, AND

16:43.033 --> 16:44.567
COMPARED THAT LIST TO WHAT WE

16:44.567 --> 16:46.867
HAD.

16:46.867 --> 16:47.934
WE HAD ALL THOSE CANCERS.

16:47.934 --> 16:50.166
EVERY SINGLE ONE.

16:50.166 --> 16:51.500
>> John: THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY

16:51.500 --> 16:52.633
DEPRESSING THING TO DISCOVER ON

16:52.633 --> 16:53.867
FACEBOOK.

16:53.867 --> 16:54.533
AND IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW TO

16:54.533 --> 16:55.500
RESPOND.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.567
I MEAN, YOU DEFINITELY DON'T

16:56.567 --> 16:58.700
WANT TO USE THE 'LIKE' BUTTON,

16:58.700 --> 16:59.433
BECAUSE THEN IT LOOKS LIKE YOU

16:59.433 --> 17:00.633
REALLY 'LIKE' THE FACT THEY JUST

17:00.633 --> 17:02.233
GOT CANCER.

17:02.233 --> 17:02.834
NOW, THERE IS THAT NEW 'SAD'

17:02.834 --> 17:04.834
EMOJI, WHICH WOULD BE PERFECT,

17:04.834 --> 17:06.033
IF YOU HADN'T ALREADY CHEAPENED

17:06.033 --> 17:07.967
IT BY USING TO RESPOND TO THE

17:07.967 --> 17:08.867
NEWS THAT CHRIS PRATT AND ANNA

17:08.867 --> 17:10.633
FARIS WERE SEPARATING.

17:10.633 --> 17:12.200
I MEAN, IT'S SAD.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.800
BUT IT'S NOT 21 CANCER SAD.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.300
IT'S NINE CANCER SAD, TOPS.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.834
THANKFULLY, SIXTY YEARS AGO, OUR

17:21.834 --> 17:22.834
GOVERNMENT, AND THE SCIENTIFIC

17:22.834 --> 17:23.800
CONSENSUS, CAME UP WITH A

17:23.800 --> 17:25.500
SOLUTION.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.900
IN 1957, THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF

17:26.900 --> 17:28.333
SCIENCES ISSUED A REPORT URGING

17:28.333 --> 17:29.967
THE CREATION OF A PERMANENT

17:29.967 --> 17:31.266
STORAGE FACILITY DEEP

17:31.266 --> 17:33.166
UNDERGROUND.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.033
BASICALLY, A NUCLEAR TOILET.

17:35.033 --> 17:36.033
AND WHILE WE DID BUILD A

17:36.033 --> 17:37.734
REPOSITORY FOR LOWER-LEVEL WASTE

17:37.734 --> 17:38.834
IN NEW MEXICO, WE STILL HAVEN'T

17:38.834 --> 17:40.700
BUILT ONE FOR THE MOST

17:40.700 --> 17:43.400
DANGEROUS, HIGH-LEVEL WASTE.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.100
AND AS A RESULT, IT'S

17:44.100 --> 17:45.266
ESSENTIALLY BEEN LEFT WHEREVER

17:45.266 --> 17:46.433
IT WAS MADE.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.133
WHICH IS NOT GOOD, BECAUSE THOSE

17:48.133 --> 17:49.233
FACILITIES WERE NOT BUILT WITH

17:49.233 --> 17:50.500
THE IDEA THEY'D BE STORING

17:50.500 --> 17:52.333
INDEFINITELY.

17:52.333 --> 17:53.800
TO CONTINUE THE TOILET METAPHOR,

17:53.800 --> 17:55.600
WE'VE BASICALLY BEEN SHITTING IN

17:55.600 --> 17:57.066
BAGS, LEAVING THEM ALL OVER THE

17:57.066 --> 17:58.633
HOUSE, AND PRAYING THEY DON'T

17:58.633 --> 18:02.066
LEAK.

18:02.066 --> 18:03.066
AND THE MOST FRIGHTENING EXAMPLE

18:03.066 --> 18:04.500
OF THIS IS THE HANFORD SITE IN

18:04.500 --> 18:06.000
WASHINGTON STATE, WHICH CREATED

18:06.000 --> 18:07.734
TWO-THIRDS OF THE PLUTONIUM IN

18:07.734 --> 18:09.533
THE U.S. ARSENAL, AND IS

18:09.533 --> 18:10.967
CURRENTLY STORING 56 MILLION

18:10.967 --> 18:12.700
GALLONS OF HIGHLY TOXIC AND

18:12.700 --> 18:14.734
RADIOACTIVE WASTE UNDERGROUND.

18:14.734 --> 18:15.934
AND OVER THE YEARS, THERE'VE

18:15.934 --> 18:18.233
BEEN SO MANY ISSUES AT HANFORD

18:18.233 --> 18:19.100
THAT THEY'VE ACHIEVED A DUBIOUS

18:19.100 --> 18:19.967
HONOR, AS ONE LOCAL NEWS STATION

18:19.967 --> 18:20.967
REPORTED WITH AN ALMOST PRIDEFUL

18:20.967 --> 18:24.500
TONE:

18:24.500 --> 18:26.066
>> THE MOST CONTAMINATED PLACE

18:26.066 --> 18:28.367
IN THE ENTIRE WESTERN HEMISPHERE

18:28.367 --> 18:29.900
ISN'T AT A POLLUTING FACTORY OR

18:29.900 --> 18:31.900
OLD CHEMICAL PLANT, IT'S RIGHT

18:31.900 --> 18:34.900
HERE IN WASHINGTON STATE.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.300
>> John: RIGHT HERE!

18:36.300 --> 18:37.533
WE DID IT, GUYS!

18:37.533 --> 18:38.734
"WASHINGTON STATE: HOME TO THE

18:38.734 --> 18:40.166
MOST CONTAMINATED PLACE IN THE

18:40.166 --> 18:42.066
WESTERN HEMISPHERE, THOUSANDS OF

18:42.066 --> 18:44.667
ACRES OF APPLE ORCHARDS, AND

18:44.667 --> 18:46.200
SEVERAL OF TED BUNDY'S GRISLIEST

18:46.200 --> 18:50.867
MURDERS."

18:50.867 --> 18:51.867
THERE'VE BEEN A STRING OF

18:51.867 --> 18:53.533
PROBLEMS AT HANFORD, FROM

18:53.533 --> 18:55.100
EXPLOSIONS TO TOXIC VAPOR

18:55.100 --> 18:56.800
RELEASES TO OVER A MILLION

18:56.800 --> 18:58.333
GALLONS OF WASTE LEAKING OUT OF

18:58.333 --> 18:59.934
THEIR TANKS OVER THE YEARS.

18:59.934 --> 19:01.266
ITS BEEN SO BAD, THE GOVERNMENT

19:01.266 --> 19:02.633
HAS HAD TO PAY OUT NEARLY ONE

19:02.633 --> 19:04.467
AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN

19:04.467 --> 19:05.800
COMPENSATION TO THOUSANDS OF

19:05.800 --> 19:07.333
WORKERS FOR ILLNESSES STEMMING

19:07.333 --> 19:10.100
FROM EXPOSURE TO TOXINS THERE.

19:10.100 --> 19:10.967
A LOCAL NEWS STATION HAS DONE A

19:10.967 --> 19:12.967
SERIES OF REPORTS ON HANFORD,

19:12.967 --> 19:14.000
AND AFTER A TUNNEL COLLAPSE IN

19:14.000 --> 19:15.633
MAY, FOUND SOME OF THE

19:15.633 --> 19:17.166
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE IS IN

19:17.166 --> 19:21.633
ALMOST COMICALLY BAD SHAPE:

19:21.633 --> 19:22.200
>> Reporter: MISTAKES DURING

19:22.200 --> 19:22.967
CONSTRUCTION ARE FACTORS IN THE

19:22.967 --> 19:24.834
DANGEROUS STATE OF THE TUNNELS.

19:24.834 --> 19:27.467
THEY'RE 55 AND 60 YEARS OLD,

19:27.467 --> 19:28.934
WELL BEYOND THEIR EXPECTED

19:28.934 --> 19:30.233
LIFESPAN.

19:30.233 --> 19:31.800
IN ADDITION, WOOD BEAMS HOLDING

19:31.800 --> 19:34.367
UP THE TUNNELS ARE ERODING AND

19:34.367 --> 19:37.000
WHAT CORRODES TIMBER BEAMS?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.867
RADIATION.

19:38.867 --> 19:40.367
YES, YOU CAN'T BUILD SOMETHING

19:40.367 --> 19:41.934
OUT OF WOOD AND EXPECT IT TO

19:41.934 --> 19:43.433
LAST FOREVER.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.400
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE LEARNED

19:44.400 --> 19:45.667
THAT FROM THE SECOND-DUMBEST OF

19:45.667 --> 19:49.300
THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.

19:49.300 --> 19:52.233
HANFORD IS A GIGANTIC PROBLEM,

19:52.233 --> 19:53.300
AND EVEN THOUGH IT HASN'T

19:53.300 --> 19:54.033
PRODUCED ANYTHING FOR THIRTY

19:54.033 --> 19:55.834
YEARS, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

19:55.834 --> 19:57.100
STILL SPENDS NEARLY TWO AND A

19:57.100 --> 19:58.567
HALF BILLION A YEAR ON CLEANING

19:58.567 --> 19:59.934
IT UP, WHICH IS CLOSE TO

19:59.934 --> 20:03.333
10 PERCENT OF ITS ANNUAL BUDGET.

20:03.333 --> 20:04.500
AND IT'S PRETTY WEIRD TO FIND

20:04.500 --> 20:06.767
OUT THAT A PLACE YOU JUST HEARD

20:06.767 --> 20:07.734
ABOUT IS GETTING THAT MUCH OF

20:07.734 --> 20:09.467
THE DOE'S MONEY.

20:09.467 --> 20:10.734
IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT THAT HALF

20:10.734 --> 20:12.400
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

20:12.400 --> 20:13.500
BUDGET GOES TO THIS MOOSE NAMED

20:13.500 --> 20:15.400
GORDON.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.500
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW THE RIGHT

20:16.500 --> 20:17.934
AMOUNT.

20:17.934 --> 20:20.433
BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT.

20:20.433 --> 20:21.266
AND IN CASE YOU'RE THINKING,

20:21.266 --> 20:22.367
"WELL, I'M GLAD I DON'T LIVE

20:22.367 --> 20:24.734
NEAR HANFORD", REMEMBER: THERE

20:24.734 --> 20:25.967
ARE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS STORING

20:25.967 --> 20:28.200
WASTE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, LOTS

20:28.200 --> 20:29.633
OF IT IN SO-CALLED "SPENT FUEL

20:29.633 --> 20:32.300
POOLS", WHERE NUCLEAR FUEL RODS

20:32.300 --> 20:34.000
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TEMPORARILY

20:34.000 --> 20:35.200
PLACED TO COOL DOWN, AND THEN

20:35.200 --> 20:36.867
PUT IN DRY CONTAINERS AND MOVED

20:36.867 --> 20:38.834
TO A PERMANENT UNDERGROUND

20:38.834 --> 20:41.367
STORAGE SITE.

20:41.367 --> 20:42.066
BUT REMEMBER: WE DON'T HAVE ONE

20:42.066 --> 20:43.133
OF THOSE.

20:43.133 --> 20:44.467
AND IN MANY PLACES, THOSE POOLS

20:44.467 --> 20:45.600
ARE JUST ACCUMULATING MORE AND

20:45.600 --> 20:47.000
MORE RODS.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.266
AND WHILE EXPERTS SAY IT'S

20:48.266 --> 20:49.367
HIGHLY UNLIKELY, IF A

20:49.367 --> 20:50.967
FUKUSHIMA-LIKE ACCIDENT HAPPENS

20:50.967 --> 20:53.266
AT ONE OF THOSE, THE RESULTS

20:53.266 --> 20:54.900
COULD BE CATASTROPHIC.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.600
>> THE NORTHEAST HAS A NUMBER OF

20:56.600 --> 20:57.867
NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS, INCLUDING

20:57.867 --> 20:59.467
THE INDIAN POINT PLANT JUST

20:59.467 --> 21:00.633
OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK CITY.

21:00.633 --> 21:02.567
IF ANY ONE OF THOSE WERE TO HAVE

21:02.567 --> 21:03.533
A SEVERE SPENT FUEL POOL

21:03.533 --> 21:06.900
ACCIDENT, YOU'RE TAKING AWAY A

21:06.900 --> 21:09.166
LOT OF BIG CITIES, A LOT OF

21:09.166 --> 21:11.066
FARMLANDS, A LOT OF THE UNITED

21:11.066 --> 21:13.266
STATES FOR DECADES, PERHAPS

21:13.266 --> 21:14.700
CENTURIES.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.166
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT, LOTS OF

21:16.166 --> 21:16.834
BIG CITIES.

21:16.834 --> 21:19.467
NEW YORK, HARTFORD, BOSTON.

21:19.467 --> 21:20.800
THAT LAST ONE IS A SHAME BECAUSE

21:20.800 --> 21:22.233
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THEY ONLY

21:22.233 --> 21:24.934
JUST GOT UNRACIST YESTERDAY.

21:24.934 --> 21:32.233
SO IT'S PRETTY CLEAR: WE NEED TO

21:32.233 --> 21:34.333
FIND A PERMANENT FACILITY TO

21:34.333 --> 21:36.166
STORE OUR MOST DANGEROUS WASTE.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.533
AND 30 YEARS AGO, WE ACTUALLY

21:37.533 --> 21:39.734
SETTLED ON A SITE: YUCCA
