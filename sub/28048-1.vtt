00:20.586 --> 00:24.551
Are about to begin an adventure
That will forever change their

00:24.586 --> 00:27.413
Lives.

00:27.448 --> 00:30.241
You look at me, you think
This is some new yorker.

00:30.275 --> 00:31.482
He's a military guy.

00:31.517 --> 00:33.413
But I'm currently in law school.

00:33.448 --> 00:35.562
And definitely don't want
Anybody to know I'm going to be

00:35.586 --> 00:38.689
A lawyer because the wrong first
Impression could make or break

00:38.724 --> 00:40.482
My entire game.

00:40.517 --> 00:45.137
I'm a super, megaultrafan of
The show.

00:45.172 --> 00:47.827
You don't know when this is
Going to happen, when this is

00:47.862 --> 00:52.413
Going to flip, and this is going
To happen, and that's my life.

00:52.448 --> 00:55.310
They'll compete
Alongside four returning

00:55.344 --> 01:00.275
David, aubry,
Wentworth, and joe.

01:00.310 --> 01:05.343
Their vast "Survivor" experience
Could make them a desired ally

01:05.379 --> 01:07.724
Or an easy early vote.

01:07.758 --> 01:10.620
I think that I'm going to
Have a target on my back, but

01:10.655 --> 01:15.103
I'm going to try my hardest to
Never shine brighter than

01:15.137 --> 01:16.172
Everybody else.

01:16.206 --> 01:21.827
And there's a secret,
Game-changing twist.

01:21.862 --> 01:27.137
After being voted out, players
Will be faced with a decision

01:27.172 --> 01:34.827
Go home or go to the edge of
Extinction, where they'll be

01:34.862 --> 01:38.482
Pushed further than ever before
For a chance to get back in the

01:38.517 --> 01:39.724
Game.

01:39.758 --> 01:42.241
In the end, only one will remain
To claim the million-dollar

01:42.275 --> 01:45.827
Prize.

01:45.862 --> 01:53.862
39 days, 18 people, one
Survivor.

01:56.172 --> 02:00.413
Welcome to the 38th season
Of "Survivor."

02:00.448 --> 02:06.206
Here's a sobering thought... In

02:06.241 --> 02:12.344
Less than 72 hours, the first
Person will be voted out.

02:12.379 --> 02:14.862
That's how fast this game moves.

02:14.896 --> 02:17.517
And every season it gets a
Little more complicated, a

02:17.551 --> 02:18.931
Little more difficult to win.

02:18.965 --> 02:24.241
No matter how good you are, you
Are always hovering on the edge

02:24.275 --> 02:25.827
Of being voted out.

02:25.862 --> 02:30.758
Just think of the history of
Great "Survivor" players who

02:30.793 --> 02:32.068
Have yet to win.

02:32.103 --> 02:36.137
In fact, let's just invite four
Of them to join you this season.

02:36.172 --> 02:37.655
Bring them in!

02:37.689 --> 02:44.310
Woooo!

02:44.344 --> 02:48.413
My god, that kelley wentworth?

02:48.448 --> 02:53.551
My two favorites players are
Kelley wentworth and my total

02:53.586 --> 02:54.758
"Survivor" crush is joe.

02:54.793 --> 02:57.482
And so we see this boat coming
And then you see the blond.

02:57.517 --> 03:00.034
And I'm like that's freaking
Kelley wentworth.

03:00.068 --> 03:05.482
And it gets closer and I'm like,
"Is that joe, too?"

03:05.517 --> 03:07.034
My god.

03:07.068 --> 03:08.551
David.

03:08.586 --> 03:09.551
Aubry.

03:09.586 --> 03:11.655
I hate that you brought
People I like.

03:11.689 --> 03:12.896
Come on up.

03:12.931 --> 03:18.965
This is who you're going to be
Playing with wentworth, davi

03:19.000 --> 03:19.379
David,.

03:19.413 --> 03:19.758
High, guys.

03:19.793 --> 03:21.275
Man bun!

03:21.310 --> 03:22.275
Joe.

03:22.310 --> 03:24.310
And aubry.

03:24.344 --> 03:25.931
My god.

03:25.965 --> 03:28.103
Welcome back.

03:28.137 --> 03:31.413
All right, let's
Review the track record of these

03:31.448 --> 03:33.275
Four returning players.

03:33.310 --> 03:36.620
Kelley wentworth... First woman
To find two hidden immunity

03:36.655 --> 03:40.379
Idols, and when she found
Herself in a deep hole, she used

03:40.413 --> 03:45.482
One of them for a record-setting
Blindside.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.655
David writing... Scared of pretty
Much everything...

03:47.689 --> 03:50.275
You don't need to relive all
That.

03:50.310 --> 03:52.896
On day one, but he
Didn't give up on himself.

03:52.931 --> 03:56.793
And he turned into a dominant
Strategic force.

03:56.827 --> 03:59.931
Joe has played most of his
"Survivor" days with a massive

03:59.965 --> 04:02.896
Target on his back.

04:02.931 --> 04:07.172
Despite that target, joe's
Tribes have won 16 challenges.

04:07.206 --> 04:11.517
And aubry, literally cried in
The shelter.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.137
The first time she played, but

04:14.172 --> 04:20.274
She overcame her insecurities
And lasted 76 out of the

04:20.310 --> 04:23.034
Possible 78 days she played.

04:23.068 --> 04:26.103
Four very different styles of
Play, four very good players.

04:26.137 --> 04:28.310
None of them won.

04:28.344 --> 04:31.206
Because "Survivor" is
Unpredictable.

04:31.241 --> 04:33.344
And that's why it's so great.

04:33.379 --> 04:35.758
And that's why you are here.

04:35.793 --> 04:38.034
You chose this adventure.

04:38.068 --> 04:42.137
And when "Survivor" pushes you
Further than you ever imagined,

04:42.172 --> 04:46.724
That is your opportunity to
Stand up, adapt, and conquer.

04:46.758 --> 04:50.758
And that is the theme we're
Going to be exploring this

04:50.793 --> 04:51.620
Season.

04:51.655 --> 04:53.965
"Edge of extinction."

04:54.000 --> 04:59.379
Kelley, david, you're on the

04:59.413 --> 05:00.896
Manu tribe wearing blue.

05:00.931 --> 05:03.551
Say hello to your tribe mates.

05:03.586 --> 05:05.551
Join jur yur tribe and pass out
Your buffs.

05:05.586 --> 05:08.965
I'm lauren.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.620
Nice to meet you.

05:10.655 --> 05:12.965
Joe and aubry, you
Are on the kama tribe.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.103
Say hello to your tribemates.

05:16.137 --> 05:22.793
All right, let's kick it up to
The next level.

05:22.827 --> 05:23.896
Oooh.

05:23.931 --> 05:26.000
This boat is loaded
With supplies.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.275
Some offer long-term help.

05:27.310 --> 05:29.034
Some are perishable.

05:29.068 --> 05:31.724
You have two minutes to get
Anything off of this boat into

05:31.758 --> 05:33.172
Your boat.

05:33.206 --> 05:36.068
Your "Survivor" adventure begins
Now.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.103
Go!

05:37.137 --> 05:42.275
This is it, all that energy
Finally coming out.

05:42.310 --> 05:47.310
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:47.344 --> 05:49.517
Hey, need some help!

05:49.551 --> 05:51.689
Need some help!

05:51.724 --> 05:54.103
There goes reem, our
First person is over.

05:54.137 --> 05:57.172
Watch out!

05:57.206 --> 06:02.310
Now everybody going over!

06:02.344 --> 06:05.620
Go, go, go.

06:05.655 --> 06:08.172
They're everywhere
Right now, all over the place,

06:08.206 --> 06:11.379
Very little communication,
Everybody just grabbing whatever

06:11.413 --> 06:13.620
They can and try to get
Overboard.

06:13.655 --> 06:19.448
Now the job becomes try to get
What you got overboard into your

06:19.482 --> 06:20.310
Boat.

06:20.344 --> 06:22.413
Keith working hard to get to
That boat.

06:22.448 --> 06:23.655
Dig in, keith!

06:23.689 --> 06:26.724
I'm not the best swimmer out
Here, and I've never been in

06:26.758 --> 06:28.000
Open water.

06:28.034 --> 06:31.275
Naturally me, who can't swim,
Will cost me to be the first one

06:31.310 --> 06:37.034
Gone, in this game, if you're on
The outs, you're out.

06:37.068 --> 06:40.931
David and wentworth
Getting in the water.

06:40.965 --> 06:43.310
The last two.

06:43.344 --> 06:47.241
Right now, kama seems to have
The early advantage with what

06:47.275 --> 06:48.586
They have in their boat.

06:48.620 --> 06:49.586
Got it.

06:49.620 --> 06:50.793
Yeah!

06:50.827 --> 06:52.068
Wooo!

06:52.103 --> 06:54.241
All right, start paddling out!

06:54.275 --> 06:55.103
Yeah!

06:55.137 --> 07:00.034
You've got what you got.

07:00.068 --> 07:02.586
"Edge of extinction" is on!

07:02.620 --> 07:05.482
We've got to go right.

07:05.517 --> 07:08.827
Great work!

07:16.000 --> 07:19.206
Great.

07:19.241 --> 07:21.413
My god.

07:21.448 --> 07:22.896
Straight up there.

07:22.931 --> 07:24.586
My gosh!

07:24.620 --> 07:26.689
We got some great stuff.

07:26.724 --> 07:30.000
Well, let's go look at our camp.

07:30.034 --> 07:34.655
Chris, man.

07:34.689 --> 07:35.172
Rick, dude.

07:35.206 --> 07:36.379
Good to meet you.

07:36.413 --> 07:37.172
As everyone's introducing
Themselves, I'm so overwhelmed

07:37.206 --> 07:38.355
By the fact that I'm in this
Game.

07:38.379 --> 07:41.724
I'm still so excited because I'm
A huge fan of the show.

07:41.758 --> 07:44.172
I've watched it since the very
First episode.

07:44.206 --> 07:45.620
I'm a morning news anchor.

07:45.655 --> 07:46.034
Are you really?

07:46.068 --> 07:46.896
Yeah.

07:46.931 --> 07:52.448
And get this... In the 115th
We're 130.

07:52.482 --> 07:53.344
So pretty good.

07:53.379 --> 07:56.724
No one thinks news anchors
Are tough.

07:56.758 --> 08:01.310
I've got dad bod out here but I
Have a lot of belief in myself.

08:01.344 --> 08:05.275
I want to break through the
Wall... Yeah!

08:05.310 --> 08:08.344
Appreciate it.

08:08.379 --> 08:09.448
My god!

08:09.482 --> 08:10.206
Are you okay?

08:10.241 --> 08:11.310
I'm fine.

08:11.344 --> 08:13.344
Just extremely clumsy.

08:13.379 --> 08:14.389
You'll see this several times.

08:14.413 --> 08:16.172
So much food.

08:16.206 --> 08:17.068
It's crazy.

08:17.103 --> 08:20.206
What is he doing?

08:20.241 --> 08:22.344
I don't trust anyone.

08:22.379 --> 08:26.448
Playing a third time, I know
I may have a target on my back

08:26.482 --> 08:29.241
Initially, so getting an initial
Alliance in the beginning is

08:29.275 --> 08:29.827
Very important.

08:29.862 --> 08:30.724
How are you?

08:30.758 --> 08:33.620
I'm good, how are you!

08:33.655 --> 08:34.344
How are you doing?

08:34.379 --> 08:35.344
Good.

08:35.379 --> 08:37.482
I played from the bottom in
"Second chance."

08:37.517 --> 08:38.724
That's not a good feeling.

08:38.758 --> 08:41.241
So this time I want to have
Genuine relationships which can

08:41.275 --> 08:43.965
Be hard for me because I'm a
Closed off person.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.034
I played soccer in college.

08:46.068 --> 08:49.310
I played soccer in holly, not
College, but it's amazing.

08:49.344 --> 08:50.413
I have to be more open.

08:50.448 --> 08:52.458
I have to get to know these
People on a human level.

08:52.482 --> 08:55.275
So who knows what they're doing?

08:55.310 --> 08:58.931
We were gog ask david,
Because, ideally, we want to

08:58.965 --> 08:59.896
Have two trees, kind of.

08:59.931 --> 09:02.310
We're waiting on your
Expertise here,.

09:02.344 --> 09:03.413
Really?

09:03.448 --> 09:05.862
The first time I played
"Survivor," I was afraid to,

09:05.896 --> 09:07.103
Like, voice an opinion.

09:07.137 --> 09:10.000
Chopping the wood, like the
Sound of that, like, rattled me.

09:10.034 --> 09:12.448
I had to plug my ears with my
Fingers.

09:12.482 --> 09:15.793
And it's, like, I was worried
That my tribemates were going to

09:15.827 --> 09:17.034
Have that perception of me.

09:17.068 --> 09:20.517
This time, people are coming to
Me, these newbies with like,

09:20.551 --> 09:21.620
What do you think?

09:21.655 --> 09:24.310
What should we do?"
And I'm like, I'm trying to give

09:24.344 --> 09:25.482
Them ideas.

09:25.517 --> 09:28.034
Which way were you thinking,
Going in this direction?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.344
Seems like, yeah, right.

09:30.379 --> 09:34.551
I want people to feel I can help
Them navigate, especially the

09:34.586 --> 09:37.413
Very early part of this game so
That they know I'm a friend.

09:37.448 --> 09:39.275
You can trust me, keep me
Around.

09:39.310 --> 09:40.803
So you open up this little
Guy here.

09:40.827 --> 09:41.620
Okay.

09:41.655 --> 09:44.413
And then it's just over and
Under.

09:44.448 --> 09:50.758
So you go under, then over.

09:50.793 --> 09:52.310
Do you do that all the time?

09:52.344 --> 09:54.413
I have mild turret's.

09:54.448 --> 09:56.862
Does that mean if you curse
One of us out.

09:56.896 --> 10:04.448
So, like the popular version
Of toweret's is like a... Thing

10:04.482 --> 10:05.344
Like that.

10:05.379 --> 10:07.275
I don't have the vocalized
Version of it.

10:07.310 --> 10:13.413
I have motor ticks... I have
Vocal tips.

10:13.448 --> 10:18.034
I have tourette's with a touch
Of o.C.D.

10:18.068 --> 10:20.965
A touch of co-co-combo.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.758
If I do and this do this and
This arm one, it's a whole bunch

10:25.793 --> 10:26.379
Mixed in.

10:26.413 --> 10:27.482
It has to be all of them.

10:27.517 --> 10:29.517
And I feel like right now
They're kind of good.

10:29.551 --> 10:32.862
But if I get really excited or I
Get really concentrated into

10:32.896 --> 10:36.275
Something or fitalk about them,
They act up a lot.

10:36.310 --> 10:40.689
Yeah so one of them is that
Little bird noise.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.034
Wow, that's impressive.

10:42.068 --> 10:45.689
I'm kind of like an open book
In a way.

10:45.724 --> 10:52.103
I'm not going to be, "Hey, en, I
Have tourette's."

10:52.137 --> 10:55.724
It's something I feel
Comfortable about.

10:55.758 --> 10:59.655
I try to have a good social game
But let's admit it, I'm awkward.

10:59.689 --> 11:03.310
I'm not good at... People... How
Would I say it?

11:03.344 --> 11:06.275
Like, they vibe in a way they
Could never.

11:06.310 --> 11:09.413
But I have tond that this is a
Game, and you have to play by

11:09.448 --> 11:13.000
The rules of the game.

11:13.034 --> 11:21.034
I guess I have to play ball!

11:23.862 --> 11:26.793
I've been dreaming of this
Moment since I was a kid.

11:26.827 --> 11:30.172
When I was, like eight years old
I ask santa claus for a

11:30.206 --> 11:31.000
"Survivor" buff.

11:31.034 --> 11:32.965
So I'm just dying to get it
Started.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.689
How are you going to chop that?

11:34.724 --> 11:35.310
Piece by piece.

11:35.344 --> 11:36.655
We're counting on you.

11:36.689 --> 11:39.448
Coming into this game, I'm
Really trying to put "Joey"

11:39.482 --> 11:41.482
"Amazing" away.

11:41.517 --> 11:44.551
I'm a better visual learner.

11:44.586 --> 11:46.034
You're a visual learner.

11:46.068 --> 11:49.103
It's hard, because new players
Are asking you, "Hey, what"

11:49.137 --> 11:51.034
"Should I do?" slam, 45.

11:51.068 --> 11:54.620
And you don't want to point
Yourself out as a threat, yet,

11:54.655 --> 11:59.448
You have so much to offer these
New players, so what do you do.

11:59.482 --> 12:01.310
You got it.

12:01.344 --> 12:03.172
Yeah.

12:03.206 --> 12:04.896
You smell that?

12:04.931 --> 12:11.620
It smells like success.

12:11.655 --> 12:14.482
Aaahhhh!

12:14.517 --> 12:15.758
Fire!

12:15.793 --> 12:19.137
Having joe on our team means
I'm better set for this game.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.379
I don't have to make fire.

12:20.413 --> 12:21.103
Joe did that.

12:21.137 --> 12:23.103
I don't have to make a shelter.

12:23.137 --> 12:23.862
Joe did that.

12:23.896 --> 12:25.103
He's just amazing.

12:25.137 --> 12:26.872
And I would love to work with
Him in this game.

12:26.896 --> 12:29.137
I'm gay and I'm still on "Team
Joe."

12:29.172 --> 12:29.758
What next?

12:29.793 --> 12:31.517
Keep it alive.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.103
Don't let it die.

12:34.137 --> 12:35.517
I'm getting nowhere.

12:35.551 --> 12:37.896
It should not be this hard.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.620
I'm done!

12:39.655 --> 12:40.827
I'm done!

12:40.862 --> 12:43.827
I'm trying to help out around
Camp as much as I can, but I

12:43.862 --> 12:44.793
Live in new york city.

12:44.827 --> 12:50.068
I have no outdoor survival
Skills whatsoever.

12:51.172 --> 12:52.413
I have a splinter!

12:52.448 --> 12:54.344
But it hurts.

12:54.379 --> 12:59.620
I think the closest that I can
Come to is that I peed in bushes

12:59.655 --> 13:01.527
Of central park once, and that
Was an emergency.

13:01.551 --> 13:03.620
So this is definitely going to
Be a test for me.

13:03.655 --> 13:04.896
Be careful with that.

13:04.931 --> 13:07.413
Because I don't want to be
The person that everybody looks

13:07.448 --> 13:10.793
At as, like, the older woman,
She's a mom.

13:10.827 --> 13:12.344
What is she doing here?

13:12.379 --> 13:13.103
She doesn't have a clue.

13:13.137 --> 13:16.862
Yes!

13:16.896 --> 13:18.827
Yes!

13:18.862 --> 13:24.965
Bamboo initiation.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.517
I think kama is off to the best
Start I have seen any tribe in

13:29.551 --> 13:30.103
"Survivor" have.

13:30.137 --> 13:31.206
We have all the rations.

13:31.241 --> 13:32.551
We have fire on the first day.

13:32.586 --> 13:34.586
We have a positive spirit.

13:34.620 --> 13:36.241
But I have something on my mind.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.517
I have a secret advantage in my
Pocket.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.724
There were 18 people in that
Boat, and I found it.

13:40.758 --> 13:43.517
And now I'm thinking I got to
Get away and read this thing.

13:43.551 --> 13:44.862
I need to get some more water.

13:44.896 --> 13:48.758
Yeah, do it.

13:48.793 --> 13:56.034
I scurred off, and I've only
Got a few spngdz "Dig three feet"

13:56.068 --> 13:58.517
East of your tree mail."

13:58.551 --> 14:05.068
Initially, of course, I'm like,
I'm going to go right now.

14:05.103 --> 14:07.384
In "Survivor" you have to lie,
Manipulate, teach, and as a

14:07.413 --> 14:09.862
Teacher, I have all these
Students that are going to be

14:09.896 --> 14:10.586
Looking at me.

14:10.620 --> 14:11.827
But they're not stupid.

14:11.862 --> 14:12.931
They know it's a game.

14:12.965 --> 14:14.517
The rules allow you to do these
Things.

14:14.551 --> 14:19.551
My god!

14:27.758 --> 14:28.793
I got a menu.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.241
I won the coupe de grace of
"Survivor" advantages.

14:31.275 --> 14:33.103
I have the best that you could
Possibly have.

14:33.137 --> 14:37.965
It says, "You have found the
Advantage menu that allows you"

14:38.000 --> 14:39.551
To choose one of the following.

14:39.586 --> 14:42.724
If you lose a challenge, you can
Steal the reward from the other

14:42.758 --> 14:43.344
Tribe.

14:43.379 --> 14:44.344
Or you get an extra vote.

14:44.379 --> 14:47.586
Or I could get individual
Immunity.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.827
That would be awesome.

14:48.862 --> 14:52.034
It would play like a regular
Hidden immunity idol and I would

14:52.068 --> 14:58.034
Have to announce it before the
Vote was read.

14:58.068 --> 15:01.586
Coming in, my goal was not to be
The first one voted out.

15:01.620 --> 15:04.206
But this has given me a new
Goal.

15:04.241 --> 15:07.724
I'm thinking this could propel
Me not only to last for a while

15:07.758 --> 15:09.758
But to win "Survivor."

15:23.310 --> 15:25.896
What do you think it means?

15:25.931 --> 15:27.000
I don't know, man.

15:27.034 --> 15:29.517
I don't, either.

15:29.551 --> 15:34.620
Everything has a reason.

15:34.655 --> 15:35.965
It's so cute.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.724
Isn't it?

15:36.758 --> 15:38.206
Like a little placemat.

15:38.241 --> 15:42.758
Maybe I'm naive but I feel
Like I've gotten good vibes from

15:42.793 --> 15:43.172
Everybody so far.

15:43.206 --> 15:44.103
Good.

15:44.137 --> 15:45.700
I feel like everybody's
Putting in work.

15:45.724 --> 15:46.862
Yeah.

15:46.896 --> 15:50.551
There are some players that
Realize the value of strong

15:50.586 --> 15:51.862
People.

15:51.896 --> 15:54.896
Being a returnee, it is kind of
Terrifying to play with newbies

15:54.931 --> 15:58.931
Because if I pop my head up too
Much, it's going to get lopped

15:58.965 --> 16:01.793
Off because I'm going to have
That "Returning player" target.

16:01.827 --> 16:05.103
I feel like we're in a good
Spot, though.

16:05.137 --> 16:06.586
I could help on fire forever.

16:06.620 --> 16:10.965
So I know that the best thing to
Do sometimes is lay in the

16:11.000 --> 16:14.896
Grass, and then come out look a
Cobra when the time is right.

16:14.931 --> 16:17.448
Tennessee.

16:17.482 --> 16:19.896
What part of tennessee?

16:19.931 --> 16:23.482
East tennessee, around pigeon
Forge.

16:23.517 --> 16:26.172
I'm not the good old southern
Boy.

16:26.206 --> 16:29.206
I know the show, and I'm here
For one reason and one reason

16:29.241 --> 16:32.137
Only, and that's to win the
Title of sole survivor.

16:32.172 --> 16:33.655
Tell me something country you
Do?

16:33.689 --> 16:36.206
I eat fried pickles.

16:36.241 --> 16:38.103
That million dollars is going to
Come in handy.

16:38.137 --> 16:41.655
And for the town of irwin, I
Might buy us a fourth stop light

16:41.689 --> 16:43.896
And go on down through main
Street.

16:43.931 --> 16:44.551
I don't know yet.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.655
We'll see.

16:45.689 --> 16:47.665
So what do you think about
Having joe and aubry?

16:47.689 --> 16:48.724
I don't know.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.724
Part of the experience is
Figuring everything out.

16:50.758 --> 16:54.586
And I don't want to just
Like, ings, hey, joe, how do we

16:54.620 --> 16:55.758
Do this?

16:55.793 --> 16:59.965
Hey, aubry, what do we do now?"
I want to figure it out

17:00.000 --> 17:01.275
Ourselvess.

17:01.310 --> 17:02.458
Being a firefighter, at the very
Core it's taking care of people

17:02.482 --> 17:06.310
So we get good at developing
Lightning-fast rapport, you

17:06.344 --> 17:08.241
Know, like, for example, with
Gavin.

17:08.275 --> 17:12.482
Right away I kind of get a sense
That he's somebody that is

17:12.517 --> 17:13.723
Thinking along the same lines.

17:13.758 --> 17:16.205
Someone new needs to win this
Game.

17:16.241 --> 17:19.655
We have to keep joe for at
Least a while because he's best

17:19.689 --> 17:20.103
Shield in the world.

17:20.137 --> 17:21.413
Exactly.

17:21.448 --> 17:25.413
We'll just crouch behind his
Big, broad, beautiful shoulders.

17:25.448 --> 17:27.931
We'll get rid of one of them if
We lose.

17:27.964 --> 17:33.793
If it's up to me, it's about ge
Getting aubry out of here fast.

17:33.827 --> 17:39.517
If I could do it tomorrow, that
Would be great.

17:39.551 --> 17:41.448
Are you guys drinking?

17:41.482 --> 17:45.482
Yes, ma'am.

17:45.517 --> 17:47.931
I'm gonna check the clothes
On the beach, too.

17:47.965 --> 17:49.344
Let's go.

17:49.379 --> 17:50.793
Clothes on the beach.

17:50.827 --> 17:52.724
I put everything on the beach.

17:52.758 --> 17:55.689
I'm super pleased with how the
Tribe's going.

17:55.724 --> 17:57.034
So far, so good, man.

17:57.068 --> 17:59.862
We're all just getting to know
Each other.

17:59.896 --> 18:01.965
Everybody's work hard.

18:02.000 --> 18:02.413
Sweet!

18:02.448 --> 18:03.758
These are yours?

18:03.793 --> 18:04.896
Dry.

18:04.931 --> 18:05.655
There's definitely an
Appreciation for what everybody

18:05.689 --> 18:08.241
Is doing right now.

18:08.275 --> 18:12.000
She keeps, like, moving my...

18:12.034 --> 18:12.344
Around.

18:12.379 --> 18:13.586
I know.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.379
Reem is so sweet and just is,
Like, super helpful mom, but I

18:17.413 --> 18:20.551
Think some people are like,
"Stop moving my stuff!"

18:20.586 --> 18:24.517
She just can't help herself,
Man.

18:24.551 --> 18:26.413
In the south we would say,
"Bless her heart."

18:26.448 --> 18:27.275
Bless her heart.

18:27.310 --> 18:28.206
I know.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.241
I found my shirt out on the
Beach today.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.734
And I was like I had that
Hanging in a tree.

18:31.758 --> 18:32.758
I know.

18:32.793 --> 18:36.344
She goes, "I fut on the sand
Because it was wet."

18:36.379 --> 18:37.241
And list like...

18:37.275 --> 18:40.758
You just have that very
Motherly vibe.

18:40.793 --> 18:44.586
And I feel like...
Don't ever put me in that

18:44.620 --> 18:45.172
Category.

18:45.206 --> 18:46.551
I know, I'm so sorry.

18:46.586 --> 18:47.827
It's all good.

18:47.862 --> 18:49.034
I know what you're saying.

18:49.068 --> 18:49.758
It's fine.

18:49.793 --> 18:50.907
You know what, dude, it's fine?

18:50.931 --> 18:52.586
I'm a momma's boy?

18:52.620 --> 18:54.034
Are you?

18:54.068 --> 18:54.551
Yeah.

18:54.586 --> 18:55.758
I'm here for you.

18:55.793 --> 19:00.965
But I'm going to tell you to
Tighten up if you get a little

19:01.000 --> 19:01.517
Too soft.

19:01.551 --> 19:03.172
I am young, I'm 19.

19:03.206 --> 19:06.275
And not having my mom out here
Is kind of affecting me.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.758
What do you do in favoriteville?

19:07.793 --> 19:10.206
I go to school.

19:10.241 --> 19:11.586
Where are you going?

19:11.620 --> 19:13.896
Du duke university.

19:13.931 --> 19:14.896
Good for you!

19:14.931 --> 19:16.344
Thank you, thank you.

19:16.379 --> 19:21.620
I feel like reem is that
Motherly person out here.

19:21.655 --> 19:25.793
Once I found out I was going to
Be on the show, I was like,

19:25.827 --> 19:28.655
Well... I would love to help you

19:28.689 --> 19:29.448
Excel at swimming.

19:29.482 --> 19:31.103
Definitely, I would love that.

19:31.137 --> 19:34.068
I thought about going out to the
Water, practicing swimming.

19:34.103 --> 19:37.241
And reem and wendy even offered
To help me with it.

19:37.275 --> 19:38.275
Keep going!

19:38.310 --> 19:40.000
Kick your feet!

19:40.034 --> 19:41.275
Kick your feet!

19:41.310 --> 19:42.424
Me and my family, we, like,
Live in a trailer in the middle

19:42.448 --> 19:43.448
Of the country.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.251
And that million dollars will
Change our lives.

19:45.275 --> 19:47.827
If I don't know something, I'm
Going to learn it.

19:47.862 --> 19:48.862
Look at keith!

19:48.896 --> 19:50.344
Yes, keith!

19:50.379 --> 19:51.793
Good job!

19:51.827 --> 19:53.482
That was really, really good.

19:53.517 --> 19:57.068
Who's out there, wendy and
Keith and reem?

19:57.103 --> 19:59.517
They have their own
Three-person alliance.

19:59.551 --> 20:01.379
I don't know what they're
Doing down there.

20:01.413 --> 20:03.310
Perfect!

20:03.344 --> 20:05.586
We got the numbers.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.827
That worked.

20:07.862 --> 20:11.862
We started out as one big
Happy family, and we're still a

20:11.896 --> 20:16.620
Big happy family, but naturally
Keith, reem, and wendy started

20:16.655 --> 20:17.620
Doing their own thing.

20:17.655 --> 20:22.206
And we saw that keith wasn't a
Great swimmer.

20:22.241 --> 20:24.103
And reem is a busy body.

20:24.137 --> 20:27.000
So it's been really helpful for
The rest of us in the tribe

20:27.034 --> 20:30.931
Because we're sitting there
Going, "Wow, those three have"

20:30.965 --> 20:32.527
Divided themselves and those
Might be the three we wanted to

20:32.551 --> 20:33.413
Vote out anyway.

20:33.448 --> 20:37.448
So, okay, keep dividing
Yourselves.

21:01.482 --> 21:09.482
That's crazy.

21:13.862 --> 21:15.034
All right!

21:15.068 --> 21:18.068
Are you guys ready for your
First immunity challenge?

21:18.103 --> 21:19.413
Yes!

21:19.448 --> 21:22.344
Let's do it!

21:22.379 --> 21:26.310
For today's challenge, you're
Going to maneuver through an

21:26.344 --> 21:27.551
Obstacle.

21:27.586 --> 21:32.275
One person must then climb to
The top of the rope and ring a

21:32.310 --> 21:33.413
Bell.

21:33.448 --> 21:35.862
You'll then attempt to cross a
Three-tier balance beam.

21:35.896 --> 21:38.931
Once across, start untying knots
To release a bar.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.793
That bar will make it much
Easier for the rest of the tribe

21:41.827 --> 21:44.896
To cross the beam.

21:44.931 --> 21:48.689
One person must then climb to
The top of the crow's nest, pull

21:48.724 --> 21:51.482
A slefer to drop a slide.

21:51.517 --> 21:58.103
Once down, six players will work
Together to solve a giant slide

21:58.137 --> 21:58.931
Puzzle.

21:58.965 --> 22:01.689
First tribe to finish wins
Immunity.

22:01.724 --> 22:04.689
This is the immunity hideol.

22:04.724 --> 22:08.896
With this back at camp, it means

22:08.931 --> 22:12.655
You're not going to tribal and
Nobody is going home.

22:12.689 --> 22:14.000
Without it, you are vulnerable.

22:14.034 --> 22:18.724
Are you also playing for reward,
Fire in the form of flint.

22:18.758 --> 22:20.527
Losers, tribal council, where
Somebody will be the first

22:20.551 --> 22:24.034
Person voted out of this game.

22:24.068 --> 22:28.931
I'll give you guys a minute to
Strategize, we'll get started.

22:28.965 --> 22:34.103
Yeah!

22:34.137 --> 22:36.034
All right, here we go!

22:36.068 --> 22:38.655
For immunity and reward.

22:38.689 --> 22:40.862
Survivors ready?

22:40.896 --> 22:42.206
Go!

22:42.241 --> 22:45.137
Go, go, go, go, go!

22:45.172 --> 22:46.862
Chris hopping over the rope!

22:46.896 --> 22:49.413
Go, go, go.

22:49.448 --> 22:50.862
You got it.

22:50.896 --> 22:51.793
Just lift them up.

22:51.827 --> 22:53.206
That's it, that's it!

22:53.241 --> 22:55.206
You have to get
Everybody to your mat before you

22:55.241 --> 22:55.724
Can move on.

22:55.758 --> 22:57.172
Come on, come on.

22:57.206 --> 23:00.103
Let's go!

23:00.137 --> 23:03.034
Kama is going to get there
First.

23:03.068 --> 23:03.689
Go, kama.

23:03.724 --> 23:04.793
Go, manu.

23:04.827 --> 23:06.793
It's going to be joe and chris
Going up the ropes.

23:06.827 --> 23:09.344
You got it, joe!

23:09.379 --> 23:11.413
This is no easy feat.

23:11.448 --> 23:12.172
That is pure strength.

23:12.206 --> 23:13.862
You gotta ring the bell.

23:13.896 --> 23:17.068
You're good, joe, you're good,
Chris.

23:17.103 --> 23:17.931
Go!

23:17.965 --> 23:19.724
Everybody up the rope ladder.

23:19.758 --> 23:21.724
Go, go, go.

23:21.758 --> 23:23.172
Anybody need help?

23:23.206 --> 23:24.275
Anybody need help?

23:24.310 --> 23:25.103
Come here, come here.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.448
We are dead even right now.

23:27.482 --> 23:28.586
Joe, you're good!

23:28.620 --> 23:29.827
Go, wendy.

23:29.862 --> 23:32.034
It's going to be joe
Heading across first.

23:32.068 --> 23:34.862
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

23:34.896 --> 23:37.344
And wendy.

23:37.379 --> 23:40.275
Lauren, go, lauren, go.

23:40.310 --> 23:42.000
Joe, you got it.

23:42.034 --> 23:43.310
Joe a across.

23:43.344 --> 23:44.665
Joe now untying knots trying to
Release that bar which will make

23:44.689 --> 23:46.206
That beam a lot easier.

23:46.241 --> 23:49.275
It is be lauren for manu.

23:49.310 --> 23:50.103
Gavin's out.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.034
Lauren drops.

23:51.068 --> 23:52.448
That's it, erik!

23:52.482 --> 23:54.793
Erik now for kama.

23:54.827 --> 23:56.724
Erik's across.

23:56.758 --> 24:00.724
Erik can now start working on
The knots with joe.

24:00.758 --> 24:01.448
There goes aubry.

24:01.482 --> 24:02.551
Look at that!

24:02.586 --> 24:03.793
Aubry's across!

24:03.827 --> 24:05.758
I freaking love you guys.

24:05.793 --> 24:07.965
You got it, chris.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.896
Chris falls.

24:09.931 --> 24:11.000
Yis kris got to get back.

24:11.034 --> 24:15.793
So far, nobody from manu is
Across.

24:15.827 --> 24:16.517
There goes david.

24:16.551 --> 24:20.620

24:20.655 --> 24:21.896

24:25.517 --> 24:26.965

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Start working on the knots.

24:29.034 --> 24:33.068
Gavin drops, big fall!

24:33.103 --> 24:34.586
Kama has their bar free.

24:34.620 --> 24:36.344
Let's go.

24:36.379 --> 24:37.517
Everybody cross.

24:37.551 --> 24:38.103
That's.

24:38.137 --> 24:39.275
You got it, nice.

24:39.310 --> 24:42.965
Kama with the early
Lead in this first immunity

24:43.000 --> 24:43.827
Challenge.

24:43.862 --> 24:45.148
Just keep going, david, keep
Going.

24:45.172 --> 24:48.241
There goes lauren for manu.

24:48.275 --> 24:51.724
Lauren crosses now for manu.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.758
One person heads across.

24:53.793 --> 24:54.413
It's going to be erik.

24:54.448 --> 24:55.413
You got it.

24:55.448 --> 24:56.724

The top of the crow's nest.

25:03.379 --> 25:06.000
Pull the lever, release the
Slide.

25:06.034 --> 25:06.827
Erik drops the slide.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.241

25:13.275 --> 25:15.689
It is lauren and
David still working on those

25:15.724 --> 25:18.034
Knots as chris gives it another
Go.

25:18.068 --> 25:20.068
Come on, come on!

25:20.103 --> 25:20.689
Yeah!

25:20.724 --> 25:21.241
Chris is across.

25:21.275 --> 25:25.965
He can start helping.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.586
Devyns is going it a go and
Devyns is across and manu has a

25:30.620 --> 25:34.448
Little moment upum.

25:34.482 --> 25:35.413
There goes wentworth.

25:35.448 --> 25:36.551
Wentworth with a huge fall.

25:36.586 --> 25:38.793
Okay, you okay?

25:38.827 --> 25:40.620
She gashed her head.

25:40.655 --> 25:42.689
Wentworth took a huge
Hit on that beam.

25:42.724 --> 25:43.241
Wentworth, you okay?

25:43.275 --> 25:44.068
Yeah.

25:44.103 --> 25:47.344
Are you okay, dude?

25:47.379 --> 25:49.241
Good slide g!

25:49.275 --> 25:50.448
Got it!

25:50.482 --> 25:52.586
Manu has their bar free.

25:52.620 --> 25:53.793
Get ready!

25:53.827 --> 25:54.413
Get ready.

25:54.448 --> 25:56.206
Run, run, run!

25:56.241 --> 25:57.206
Manu running across.

25:57.241 --> 26:01.551
Manu with a lot of time to make
Up now.

26:01.586 --> 26:03.551
Lauren scampers across for manu.

26:03.586 --> 26:05.862
You got it, lauren.

26:05.896 --> 26:08.310
Lauren quickly to the top of the
Crow's nest.

26:08.344 --> 26:10.931
You got it, girl!

26:10.965 --> 26:12.758
Move, move, move, move!

26:12.793 --> 26:13.689
Joe's across.

26:13.724 --> 26:15.413
Six people on the puzzle now.

26:15.448 --> 26:17.827
Gotta get the marked piece out.

26:17.862 --> 26:18.896
Ready?

26:18.931 --> 26:21.413
Push.

26:21.448 --> 26:23.482
Kama working on the puzzle.

26:23.517 --> 26:25.379
One, two, three.

26:25.413 --> 26:26.137
Middle one.

26:26.172 --> 26:27.206
Joe directing his tribe.

26:27.241 --> 26:29.103
All right, now this one.

26:29.137 --> 26:30.413
These pieces are heavy.

26:30.448 --> 26:32.172
One, two, three.

26:32.206 --> 26:33.931
Let's go, rick!

26:33.965 --> 26:38.206
Manu knows challenges
Can be won or lost on the

26:38.241 --> 26:38.586
Puzzle.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.275
Go, manu!

26:40.310 --> 26:41.620
This guy, over here.

26:41.655 --> 26:44.103
David now trying to
Get an eye on this puzzle.

26:44.137 --> 26:47.517
This is where you can make a big
Comeback if you know how to do

26:47.551 --> 26:51.758
This puzzle.

26:51.793 --> 26:54.172
One, two, three!

26:54.206 --> 26:58.551
Can manu close the
Gap or will kama hold on to

26:58.586 --> 26:59.551
Their lead?

26:59.586 --> 27:02.034
It needs to be centered "P."

27:02.068 --> 27:05.310
Small ones over?

27:05.344 --> 27:08.827
Suddenly, kama comes to a stop.

27:08.862 --> 27:10.724
Hold on.

27:10.758 --> 27:11.965
Slow down a little bit.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.620
Manu now has a shot
To get back in this.

27:15.655 --> 27:16.655
One, two, three.

27:16.689 --> 27:19.034
If this comes up, those go over.

27:19.068 --> 27:20.448
Yyes, yes, yes!

27:20.482 --> 27:25.931
Kama think they've
Got something.

27:25.965 --> 27:29.275
Manu fighting to be in this.

27:29.310 --> 27:34.862
Everybody using all their
Strength.

27:34.896 --> 27:37.413
This could be very close!

27:37.448 --> 27:41.206
Gavin, push the one next to
It a little.

27:41.241 --> 27:42.931
We're right there with them!

27:42.965 --> 27:47.655
This challenge has
Taken a toll on a few bodes.

27:47.689 --> 27:49.413
We're almost there!

27:49.448 --> 27:50.000
We're almost there!

27:50.034 --> 27:52.241
It's stuck!

27:52.275 --> 27:55.655
Kama sliding their
Last piece into place.

27:55.689 --> 27:57.034
Kama for the win.

27:57.068 --> 27:59.827
Kama wins immunity!

27:59.862 --> 28:02.758
Sending manu to tribal council.

28:02.793 --> 28:06.862
Where somebody will be the first
Person voted out of this game.

28:06.896 --> 28:09.724
Wow!

28:09.758 --> 28:13.275
Yes!

28:13.310 --> 28:15.965
Kama, congratulations.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.034
First immunity win.

28:17.586 --> 28:20.241
Thank you, jeff.

28:20.275 --> 28:23.517
Here we are, tribal
Council tonight, somebody going

28:23.551 --> 28:24.482
Home.

28:24.517 --> 28:26.044
Kama, it will not be anybody
From your tribe.

28:26.068 --> 28:28.827
Enjoy the night off.

28:28.862 --> 28:31.482
Almost forgot your reward.

28:31.517 --> 28:31.965
Flint.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.413
Thank you, sir.

28:32.448 --> 28:34.758
Thanks, jeff!

28:34.793 --> 28:37.965
All right, manu, I
Think wentworth's face says it

28:38.000 --> 28:38.965
All.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.241
Nothing about this game is easy.

28:41.275 --> 28:43.586
First person will be voted out
Tonight.

28:43.620 --> 28:46.206
Should make for an interesting
Afternoon back at camp.

28:46.241 --> 28:46.758
Grab your stuff.

28:46.793 --> 28:47.620
Head back to camp.

28:47.655 --> 28:48.931
See you tonight at tribal.

28:48.965 --> 28:51.551
Losing first challenge is one
Of the worst thing to happen to

28:51.586 --> 28:52.482
You.

28:52.517 --> 28:53.896
You have very little wiggle
Room.

28:53.931 --> 28:55.631
You have known these people for
Three games daze.

28:55.655 --> 29:00.517
And I know any little thing can
Cent you out of this game and

29:00.551 --> 29:02.551
You can be gone in a second.

29:23.172 --> 29:25.517
I'm so pissed!

29:25.551 --> 29:28.275
You never come out here
Expecting to lose at that's

29:28.310 --> 29:30.655
First immunity challenge.

29:30.689 --> 29:35.896
Even though I feel I'm more
Introverted, I need to have more

29:35.931 --> 29:36.517
One-on-one conversations.

29:36.551 --> 29:38.275
What's the split?

29:38.310 --> 29:39.793
Tell me what's going on?

29:39.827 --> 29:40.931
What's on your mind.

29:40.965 --> 29:43.448
It seems like lauren and
Kelley seem pretty tight.

29:43.482 --> 29:47.586
And I'm not saying that they're
Shady, but lauren and kelley

29:47.620 --> 29:48.931
Need to be separated.

29:48.965 --> 29:51.000
Those two are like a power
Couple.

29:51.034 --> 29:54.517
As soon as I was at the well,
Reem was not afraid to put it

29:54.551 --> 29:56.310
Out there.

29:56.344 --> 29:58.413
They want to get kelly and
Lauren.

29:58.448 --> 30:01.896
They have linked them up as this
Dynamic duothat they think has

30:01.931 --> 30:04.044
Control of everything, so
They're trying to get the votes

30:04.068 --> 30:05.586
Together to get one of those two
Out.

30:05.620 --> 30:06.941
Are you seriously not working
With them?

30:06.965 --> 30:07.793
Not yet.

30:07.827 --> 30:11.689
And they're just dogging rick
Down.

30:11.724 --> 30:13.527
He doesn't even have, like, a
Chance to breathe.

30:13.551 --> 30:15.137
What are you thinking?

30:15.172 --> 30:16.206
Of those two.

30:16.241 --> 30:18.379
What are you thinking in
General?

30:18.413 --> 30:20.586
So I wasn't really feeling
The whole well vibe.

30:20.620 --> 30:22.803
And something clicked in my head
They have to start playing this

30:22.827 --> 30:24.000
Game for me.

30:24.034 --> 30:27.862
And at the end of the day, no
Matter who goes home, I just

30:27.896 --> 30:29.310
Can't be the one to go home.

30:29.344 --> 30:32.413
They crowded me and rick
Instantly and they're trying to

30:32.448 --> 30:34.620
Pull rick to their side.

30:34.655 --> 30:35.965
And the target's on y'all.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.034
Of course, yeah.

30:37.068 --> 30:39.103
Obviously we know what we're
Door, right?

30:39.137 --> 30:40.734
I definitely think we need to
Keep the tribe strong is the

30:40.758 --> 30:41.551
Bottom line.

30:41.586 --> 30:42.758
Like, no matter what.

30:42.793 --> 30:45.896
I just feel like we have a
Better chance of winning the

30:45.931 --> 30:49.517
Next challenge with wendy and it
Seems that's more important than

30:49.551 --> 30:50.068
Anything.

30:50.103 --> 30:53.068
I don't with reem.

30:53.103 --> 30:56.413
If someone it just kind of
Keep tabs on wendy.

30:56.448 --> 31:00.275
Let me pull her aside and see
What she says and who she throws

31:00.310 --> 31:01.172
Out there.

31:01.206 --> 31:07.793
All right, why don't you,
Yeah, yeah.

31:07.827 --> 31:12.172
Wentworth and lauren, I don't
Like how tight they are.

31:12.206 --> 31:15.724
They're a couple, andun couples
Are the wig biggest threat.

31:15.758 --> 31:18.206
A lot of people don't have
Faith in reem.

31:18.241 --> 31:20.965
I just want you to know the
Kind of player.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.620
I'm voting with reem tonight.

31:22.655 --> 31:24.517
Just out of loyalty to her.

31:24.551 --> 31:25.689
No, I get it.

31:25.724 --> 31:31.862
I feel like they're not
Giving enough credit to reem.

31:31.896 --> 31:33.827
They're really just taking her
Age into account.

31:33.862 --> 31:34.896
You know what?

31:34.931 --> 31:36.527
I'm going to put all these right
In the sun.

31:36.551 --> 31:40.482
She can't help her age, but
She can pull her wait waet,

31:40.517 --> 31:41.689
Which she has been doing.

31:41.724 --> 31:43.562
I know you're trying to save
Your friend and that shows

31:43.586 --> 31:44.965
Loyalty but it's a sinking ship.

31:45.000 --> 31:45.689
She's going home tonight.

31:45.724 --> 31:46.310
Think about it.

31:46.344 --> 31:47.448
Let me talk to david.

31:47.482 --> 31:52.103
You guys talk, but come back
To me.

31:52.137 --> 31:53.172
I will.

31:53.206 --> 31:53.827
I'm serious.

31:53.862 --> 31:55.275
We will, we will.

31:55.310 --> 31:59.379
Okay.

31:59.413 --> 32:01.620
Well, here's what I'm
Thinking now.

32:01.655 --> 32:02.448
No.

32:02.482 --> 32:05.103
My mind has changed a little
Bit.

32:05.137 --> 32:05.862
No.

32:05.896 --> 32:08.344
Maybe we just take wendy out.

32:08.379 --> 32:09.896
She's too stubborn.

32:09.931 --> 32:13.034
Wendy, it was extremely
Surprising to me no matter how,

32:13.068 --> 32:16.827
Like, direct we were telling her
It was going to be reem, she

32:16.862 --> 32:17.827
Pushed back.

32:17.862 --> 32:19.931
And that's at least causing
Alarm in my head.

32:19.965 --> 32:22.068
What does that mean down the
Road?

32:22.103 --> 32:23.758
I can work with someone like
That?

32:23.793 --> 32:25.931
What helps me and you out?

32:25.965 --> 32:27.206
Where are we best?

32:27.241 --> 32:29.896
This vote tonight I think should
Maybe be wendy.

32:29.931 --> 32:31.044
They want to vote her off?

32:31.068 --> 32:34.896
They want to vote me off?

32:34.931 --> 32:38.793
When you hear your name out
There, it's like, "Screw you",

32:38.827 --> 32:40.068
Dude."

32:40.103 --> 32:42.044
Just because I didn't go, like,
Power lift before I showed up,

32:42.068 --> 32:43.034
Like, they're idiots.

32:43.068 --> 32:44.655
I am so strong.

32:44.689 --> 32:48.103
You don't even know this old
Lady, bro.

32:48.137 --> 32:49.655
This old lady can kill it.

32:49.689 --> 32:52.034
I know that they're throwing my
Name around.

32:52.068 --> 32:54.172
And I don't really blif a...

32:54.206 --> 32:54.862
Because...
Would you put the machete

32:54.896 --> 32:56.137
Down?

32:56.172 --> 32:59.862
Wentworth, doesn't dnt she
Get hurt today?

32:59.896 --> 33:01.344
I didn't get hurt today.

33:01.379 --> 33:02.310
I'm not done.

33:02.344 --> 33:03.103
Scrappy, dude.

33:03.137 --> 33:05.000
I'm not going down without a
Fight.

33:05.034 --> 33:07.793
I didn't leave everything to go
Down like that.

33:07.827 --> 33:09.827
Screw them, man.

33:43.344 --> 33:44.482
A torch.

33:44.517 --> 33:46.389
Go ahead and grab a torch,
Approach the flame, dip it in

33:46.413 --> 33:53.517
And get fire.

33:53.551 --> 33:56.827
This is part of the ritual of
Tribal council because in this

33:56.862 --> 33:59.620
Game, fire represents your life.

33:59.655 --> 34:02.551
And when your fire is gone, so
Are you.

34:02.586 --> 34:05.275
Let's talk about first
Impression.

34:05.310 --> 34:08.103
Devens, what did you notice
About the initial vibe of the

34:08.137 --> 34:09.379
Tribe, just as a group?

34:09.413 --> 34:12.172
Right off the bat, actually,
I think it was one big tribe.

34:12.206 --> 34:16.413
But as the day progressed, some
People were weaving frond, some

34:16.447 --> 34:18.688
People were working on the
Shelter, so, obviously, people

34:18.724 --> 34:21.896
Kind of formed mini-groups
Within the largey group.

34:21.931 --> 34:25.103
Reem, did you notice,
That people paired in threes or

34:25.137 --> 34:26.310
Fours?

34:26.344 --> 34:27.768
It's like people who were
Working on certain things just

34:27.793 --> 34:29.896
Ended up talking because they
Were working together.

34:29.931 --> 34:32.516
It's not like they were...
You seem annoyed already.

34:32.551 --> 34:35.275
My name got thrown out today.

34:35.310 --> 34:38.103
I'm pissed off, and there's no
Good reason behind it.

34:38.137 --> 34:41.447
It's not like people were
Secretly speaking among each

34:41.482 --> 34:42.585
Other.

34:42.620 --> 34:45.585
They were just doing their jobs,
You know what I mean?

34:45.620 --> 34:46.241
Whatever.

34:46.275 --> 34:47.068
I'm just in general annoyed.

34:47.103 --> 34:48.862
But that is part of this game.

34:48.896 --> 34:50.655
You know, my name was thrown out
There.

34:50.688 --> 34:51.931
I heard lauren's name.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.413
I heard reem's name.

34:53.447 --> 34:54.793
It's how this game it played.

34:54.827 --> 34:58.827
Fimay... The reason why her
Name was even thrown out is

34:58.862 --> 35:00.241
Because she's a legend, you
Know.

35:00.275 --> 35:02.551
It was an honor to have her name
Thrown out, really.

35:02.586 --> 35:06.137
It's not an honor when you
Can still be voted out.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.379
No disrespect.

35:07.413 --> 35:09.137
She is a great, great player.

35:09.172 --> 35:11.103
Why not mention david's name?

35:11.137 --> 35:12.965
Why me specifically?

35:13.000 --> 35:15.896
I'm just wondering jiek I'll not
Done.

35:15.931 --> 35:18.896
Here's the funny thing, my name
Was thrown out apparently

35:18.931 --> 35:20.251
Because they want to keep the
Tribe strong.

35:20.275 --> 35:22.517
I'm going with age
Discrimination, to be quite

35:22.551 --> 35:23.758
Honest with you.

35:23.793 --> 35:26.586
Because how would you know if I
Wasn't strong or not strong?

35:26.620 --> 35:28.907
I mean, do we need to have, like
A wrestling competition here?

35:28.931 --> 35:33.000
Is that something we can do
In tribal, jeff?

35:33.034 --> 35:35.034
I'm just saying.

35:35.068 --> 35:37.103
Reem, is this normal for you?

35:37.137 --> 35:38.344
What?

35:38.379 --> 35:41.172
Are you a little
Confrontational just by nature

35:41.206 --> 35:42.413
Back home?

35:42.448 --> 35:46.793
Not confrontational, but if I
Think someone's wrong, I'll

35:46.827 --> 35:50.241
Definitely be like, "I don't
Understand why you think you're"

35:50.275 --> 35:50.758
Right."

35:50.793 --> 35:51.413
Help me understand.

35:51.448 --> 35:52.527
That's what I was wondering.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.724
If anything, reem, if
Someone's being a little too

35:54.758 --> 35:56.527
Much, sometimes it rubs
Different personalities the

35:56.551 --> 35:57.241
Wrong way.

35:57.275 --> 35:59.689
Who was I being too much to?

35:59.724 --> 36:01.551
To me, you're a little too much.

36:01.586 --> 36:02.137
Why?

36:02.172 --> 36:04.206
With what?

36:04.241 --> 36:05.424
You're doing stuff and moving
Things around and people can't

36:05.448 --> 36:08.517
Find their thidges and remind
People to, like, drink their

36:08.551 --> 36:10.000
Water and put their shoes on.

36:10.034 --> 36:11.551
I know there's good in all of
That.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.758
My god.

36:12.793 --> 36:13.413
Sometimes people don't want

36:13.448 --> 36:16.344
To hear a motherly figure.

36:16.379 --> 36:19.034
I did that so nobody's stuff
Got wet.

36:19.068 --> 36:20.965
Totally agree.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.034
I was being caring, considerate.

36:24.068 --> 36:27.482
Tell me more.

36:27.517 --> 36:28.896
, please, I'd love to learn.

36:28.931 --> 36:31.137
You're taking this one
Example and milking it.

36:31.172 --> 36:33.034
Personalities clash.

36:33.068 --> 36:35.034
We all really like everybody but
One person...

36:35.068 --> 36:36.689
I'm the hated person on the
Tribe.

36:36.724 --> 36:40.793
See, you're put... I never
Used the word "Hated."

36:40.827 --> 36:43.551
In my opinion, your personality
Would be hardest for me to deal

36:43.586 --> 36:44.724
With for 39 days.

36:44.758 --> 36:48.137
But your clothes were dry
Though, for the record, were

36:48.172 --> 36:48.931
They not?

36:48.965 --> 36:52.344
No, but I... Okay, you're right.

36:52.379 --> 36:53.896
Wendy, where do you
Weigh in on this?

36:53.931 --> 36:56.344
I do share conflicting pbs
About reem.

36:56.379 --> 36:58.620
The same reasons they dislike
Her, I like her.

36:58.655 --> 37:01.862
I'm really close to my mom, so
With her being here, it kind of

37:01.896 --> 37:02.724
Helps me out.

37:02.758 --> 37:05.068
I don't think anyone dislikes
Reem.

37:05.103 --> 37:06.310
I agree.

37:06.344 --> 37:07.389
If we had something hanging
In the tree, that was probably

37:07.413 --> 37:09.689
My way of drying it out.

37:09.724 --> 37:12.034
I can just be honest with you
All?

37:12.068 --> 37:13.734
If you didn't want me to touch
Your stuff all you had to do was

37:13.758 --> 37:15.931
Say, "Hey, please, don't touch
My stuff."

37:15.965 --> 37:16.655
Done.

37:16.689 --> 37:17.551
I appreciate your honesty, I do.

37:17.586 --> 37:20.517
I'm sorry I touched thur your
Things.

37:20.551 --> 37:24.137
Reem, when you say,
"It's my fault," that's not what

37:24.172 --> 37:25.344
You really mean?

37:25.379 --> 37:27.827
When I came out here, I
Wasn't going to tell anybody how

37:27.862 --> 37:30.000
Old I am, that I was a mom.

37:30.034 --> 37:31.517
But I am their mom.

37:31.551 --> 37:33.586
They don't want their mom out
Here with them.

37:33.620 --> 37:34.689
That's fine.

37:34.724 --> 37:38.172
I wouldn't have... A lot of
Things would have happened

37:38.206 --> 37:40.965
Differently, yes.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.379
Wendy, what do you
Think's going to happen tonight?

37:43.413 --> 37:46.310
Just from, like, the talk
From the camp and everything, I

37:46.344 --> 37:49.241
Am sorry to say, but I feel like
Reem's going home.

37:49.275 --> 37:51.034
It's like a nightmare.

37:51.068 --> 37:54.517
Reem, we haven't had
A lot of tribals where almost

37:54.551 --> 37:58.896
The entire conversation has
Centered around one person.

37:58.931 --> 38:00.103
I don't know.

38:00.137 --> 38:02.241
Like, I'm not going to lie to
You.

38:02.275 --> 38:04.482
This is, like, a freaking
Nightmare to be the first one

38:04.517 --> 38:07.034
Voted off, you know, because
I've been watching since day

38:07.068 --> 38:07.620
One.

38:07.655 --> 38:08.655
Like, this is terrible.

38:08.689 --> 38:10.517
I'm so disappointed.

38:10.551 --> 38:12.724
I guess it was just too much for
Them.

38:12.758 --> 38:19.034
But I hope it's not too much for
My best friends and my family,

38:19.068 --> 38:21.068
Because I'm just surprised.

38:21.103 --> 38:22.655
And, you know, famous last
Words.

38:22.689 --> 38:24.206
Don't be the first one voted
Out.

38:24.241 --> 38:25.379
Somebody always is.

38:25.413 --> 38:28.827
I know.

38:28.862 --> 38:31.137
All right, it is time to vote.

38:31.172 --> 38:37.068
Kelley, you're up.

39:08.965 --> 39:16.965
I'll go tally the votes.

39:20.827 --> 39:24.000
If anybody has a
Hidden immunity idol and you

39:24.034 --> 39:28.241
Want to play it, now would be
The time to do so.

39:28.275 --> 39:31.586
Okay.

39:31.620 --> 39:35.275
I'll read the votes.

39:35.310 --> 39:43.310
First vote, reem.

39:43.448 --> 39:47.034
Kelley.

39:47.068 --> 39:50.758
Wendy.

39:50.793 --> 39:54.620
Lauren.

39:54.655 --> 39:55.172
Reem.

39:55.206 --> 39:55.689
That's two votes reem.

39:55.724 --> 39:56.034
Shocker.

39:56.068 --> 39:57.275
Wendy.

39:57.310 --> 39:58.355
That's two votes wendy, two
Votes reem, one vote lauren, one

39:58.379 --> 40:01.137
Vote wentworth.

40:01.172 --> 40:01.724
Reem.

40:01.758 --> 40:06.206
That's three votes reem.

40:06.241 --> 40:07.482
Wendy.

40:07.517 --> 40:14.275
We're tied, three votes wendy,
Three votes reem, one vote left.

40:14.310 --> 40:18.000
First person voted out of
"Survivor edge of extinction,"

40:18.034 --> 40:18.793
Reem.

40:18.827 --> 40:24.931
You need to bring me your torch.

40:28.586 --> 40:31.413
Reem, the tribe has spoken.

40:31.448 --> 40:34.275
Thanks.

40:34.310 --> 40:35.758
Time for you to go.

40:35.793 --> 40:39.103
Bye, reem.

40:39.137 --> 40:40.034
Thank you!

40:40.068 --> 40:43.275
I hope it pours down rain on
Those people.

40:43.310 --> 40:46.034
Ridiculous.

40:46.068 --> 40:54.068
So lame.

40:56.448 --> 41:00.586
What?

41:00.620 --> 41:03.379
"You have a decision to make."

41:03.413 --> 41:07.172
"If you do not want to play
Anymore, follow this path, and

41:07.206 --> 41:10.206
Your adventure will end."

41:10.241 --> 41:14.517
"If you want a chance to get
Back in the game, take the torch

41:14.551 --> 41:19.724
And get on the boat"?

41:21.068 --> 41:24.068
Nice!

42:07.517 --> 42:09.172
My god!

42:09.206 --> 42:12.137
There is nothing here.

42:12.172 --> 42:20.172
What is going on?

42:21.344 --> 42:22.931
Holy crap!

42:22.965 --> 42:25.206
What is it?

42:29.482 --> 42:31.482
Stay tuned for scenes
From our next episode

42:39.344 --> 42:42.034
Next time on "Survivor"

42:42.068 --> 42:43.689
If your fire is too bright.

42:43.724 --> 42:45.044
They had their moment to shine.

42:45.068 --> 42:45.965
It's our chance.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.448
Joe and I are under a
Magnifying glass.

42:48.482 --> 42:51.862
A phoenix mutt turn.

42:51.896 --> 42:55.965
To rise fromlet ashes opinion.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.793
What do I have to go through
For this second chance?

42:58.827 --> 43:01.517
No offense, but screw my tribe.

43:01.551 --> 43:04.689
Like, you're mad they put your
Freaking clothes on the beach to

43:04.724 --> 43:05.275
Dry?

43:05.310 --> 43:06.551
Whatever.

43:06.586 --> 43:09.862
And I don't want to cry because
I'm still in the game and I'm

43:09.896 --> 43:14.586
Happy to be in the game, but
It's wet and it's cold.

43:14.620 --> 43:16.793
I just gotta stick it out.

43:16.827 --> 43:19.758
Edge of freaking extinction.

43:20.305 --> 43:26.642
