If my designs are compromised,
I must self-destruct.

THE MANDALORIAN:
What're you talking about?

35:01.894 --> 35:04.396
IG-11: I am not permitted to be captured.
I must be destroyed.

35:04.521 --> 35:06.815
Are we gonna keep talking,
or get out of here?

35:07.608 --> 35:09.359
IG-11: I can no longer carry this for you.

35:11.695 --> 35:13.030
Nor can I watch over the child.

35:13.655 --> 35:16.033
THE MANDALORIAN:
Wait. You can't self-destruct.

35:16.116 --> 35:17.910
Your base command is to watch the child.

35:17.993 --> 35:20.329
That supersedes
your manufacturer's protocol, right?

35:21.371 --> 35:22.956
-Right?
-IG-11: This is correct.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.667
THE MANDALORIAN: Good. Now, grab a blaster
and help us shoot our way out.

35:25.751 --> 35:27.461
IG-11: Victory through combat
is impossible.

35:27.544 --> 35:30.297
We will be captured.
The child will be lost.

35:30.380 --> 35:34.176
Sadly, there is no scenario where
the child is saved, in which I survive.

35:35.260 --> 35:37.054
THE MANDALORIAN:
Listen, you're not going anywhere.

35:37.137 --> 35:38.680
We need you. Let's just come up with a...

35:38.764 --> 35:41.308
IG-11: Please tell me the child
will be safe in your care.

35:41.391 --> 35:44.228
If you do so,
I can default to my secondary command.

35:44.853 --> 35:46.355
THE MANDALORIAN: But you'll be destroyed.

35:46.605 --> 35:50.192
IG-11: And you will live,
and I will have served my purpose.

35:51.401 --> 35:53.362
THE MANDALORIAN: No. We need you.

35:53.445 --> 35:56.323
IG-11: There is nothing to be sad about.
I have never been alive.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.534
THE MANDALORIAN: I'm not sad.

35:58.700 --> 36:02.538

I've analyzed your voice.

I cannot be captured.
