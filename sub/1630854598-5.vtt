00:17.000 --> 00:18.791
-You…
-I told you!

00:18.875 --> 00:20.291
It's a taboo for me to lose money!

00:20.875 --> 00:22.583
-What?
-Twenty million…

00:22.666 --> 00:24.500
-I didn't hear you.
-Twenty million.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.583
-Twenty what?
-Twenty million…

00:29.083 --> 00:30.833
Did I hear her wrong?

00:35.375 --> 00:36.833
Why didn't you say so?

00:50.833 --> 00:54.541
I'm sorry,
detective. He told you all that he knows.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.541
I understand, ma'am.

00:59.041 --> 01:01.791
But we need to ask him questions
that can jog his memory

01:01.875 --> 01:03.833
or anything he forgot to tell us.

01:11.916 --> 01:13.041
All right, ma'am.

01:16.208 --> 01:18.208
Call us if you remember anything else.

01:24.041 --> 01:26.250
I told you she is good luck.

01:27.666 --> 01:29.750
It's a stupid idea.

01:29.833 --> 01:31.750
Kidnapping influential children
are off-limits.

01:31.833 --> 01:33.750
Their parents will
come after us with everything!

01:34.333 --> 01:38.791
It's done. Government.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Ah…

01:45.416 --> 01:46.416
It's easy.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.541
Don't join…

01:49.041 --> 01:51.041
I'll make Adufe my partner.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.375
Tell me something.

01:55.458 --> 01:57.708
Did your useless drug business
bring this 20 million?

01:59.166 --> 02:00.500
It was her.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.000
Listen very well, friend.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.000
Ishaya does not work for you anymore.

02:08.708 --> 02:09.625
That's final.

02:10.291 --> 02:11.666
He works for me now.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.750
No more
selling that useless drug.

02:27.708 --> 02:30.000
Michael, you need to talk to Ishaya.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.541
You need to talk to Ishaya.
Ishaya has gone crazy.

02:33.541 --> 02:35.958
What happened?
Why is your house such a mess?

02:37.708 --> 02:38.583
Your mother was right.

02:41.208 --> 02:43.208
My boss fired me…

02:43.291 --> 02:45.041
…because of your brother.

02:45.125 --> 02:46.791
My rent is due.

02:46.875 --> 02:51.166
I'm ashamed to ask my father for help,
I don't want to hear a thing about Ishaya.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.791
Why not stay with us?

02:53.875 --> 02:56.250
If I stay with you,
every day I'll hear what Ishaya did.

02:56.333 --> 02:57.750
I promise, you won't.

03:05.375 --> 03:09.041
At least come for a few days,
until we figure something out.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.750
Okay, but just for a bit.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.875
<i>My boyfriend, Atlas,</i>

03:26.958 --> 03:29.625
<i>was cheating on me</i>
<i>with my best friend, Nnenna.</i>

03:29.708 --> 03:33.208
I'm so glad you
kicked him out of your house. Coward.

03:33.875 --> 03:37.083
With best friends like some people,
who needs enemies?

03:39.250 --> 03:40.250
Stop.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.750
Car.

03:46.333 --> 03:47.291
Can we talk?

03:53.958 --> 03:54.916
Such a liar.

03:55.416 --> 03:56.958
What a narcissist.

03:57.916 --> 04:00.416
-Car, please, we need to talk.
-Atlas, let go.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.666
Car, please. Please.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.541
-Let go!
-Guy, leave her alone.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.333
Mind your business.

04:06.833 --> 04:08.083
Car, please, we need to--

04:08.666 --> 04:09.833
Fuck off!

04:11.083 --> 04:14.083
Carmen, just go inside.
This is one is crazy.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.458
You're crazy, huh?
Are you mad?

04:17.041 --> 04:18.666
Oh, are you mad?

04:21.000 --> 04:21.875
Ishaya!

04:21.958 --> 04:24.125
-Hey!
-He's gone mad!

04:26.333 --> 04:28.708
-Chill, bro!
-What are you doing?

04:28.791 --> 04:29.708
Stop it!

04:30.958 --> 04:33.583
Ishaya Bello!
To the principal's office now!

04:38.333 --> 04:39.791
Adufe, baby.

04:40.916 --> 04:42.500
I have surprise for you.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.208
Come here.

04:46.541 --> 04:47.666
Daddy's girl.

04:56.916 --> 04:58.208
Gold chain.

04:59.375 --> 05:01.375
For your contribution.

05:05.625 --> 05:07.208
Thank you, my love.

05:08.125 --> 05:11.166
That's not all. Baido, hold this.

05:11.708 --> 05:13.041
Check inside.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.041
Point one percent?

05:26.125 --> 05:27.833
You're my partner now…

05:27.916 --> 05:29.125
…for life.

05:29.625 --> 05:30.458
Ah?

05:31.166 --> 05:34.125
Zero point one percent for my baby girl.

05:35.041 --> 05:37.791
Just make sure our
new business prospers,

05:37.875 --> 05:39.375
and we won't have a problem.

05:39.958 --> 05:40.916
Okay?

05:41.708 --> 05:43.791
Good girl. Go now.

05:45.208 --> 05:46.166
Enjoy yourself.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.458
I hope you didn't cheat me?

05:50.916 --> 05:52.041
Ishaya.

05:55.833 --> 05:56.791
Hey.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.791
-Is everything all right?

06:03.875 --> 06:05.250
Well, I have great news.

06:05.958 --> 06:09.875
The school wants to showcase
you and your work for the grant on Blink.

06:10.375 --> 06:12.833
So make sure you spend some time
to shape it up, okay?

06:14.541 --> 06:15.625
What's the point?

06:17.041 --> 06:19.250
Ishaya, what do you mean?

06:24.458 --> 06:26.708
-What do you want?
-<i>Come outside. Now.</i>

06:27.208 --> 06:28.250
Ishaya.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.791
I thought you were going
to keep malice with me forever.

06:38.625 --> 06:41.666
-Carmen, I don't--
-I need it. And you owe me.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.166
I'm about to go crazy.

06:44.250 --> 06:46.416
Just one, please.

06:48.833 --> 06:50.291
I'm sorry. I have to go.

06:50.791 --> 06:51.791
Ishaya…

06:51.875 --> 06:54.250
Rahila, please,
why are you crying?

06:54.333 --> 06:56.750
I thought the boy is back home.
What's this about police?

06:56.833 --> 06:59.500
<i> Ishaya's involved.</i>
<i>I saw that man that kidnapped him.</i>

06:59.583 --> 07:01.916
You know what?
I'll come see you when I'm done with work.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.958
And don't go to report to any police.
You know he pays those people.

07:05.041 --> 07:07.041
Before you get into trouble.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.250
Bye-bye.

07:08.750 --> 07:09.625
Adufe.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.583
This will help with the bruises.

07:19.791 --> 07:20.791
Thank you.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.125
Ishaya.

07:39.083 --> 07:39.958
Please.

07:42.458 --> 07:45.625
Carmen, I know that
things are difficult right now.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.166
But this is not going to help.

07:49.125 --> 07:51.208
Maybe you could… Carmen, Carmen…

08:05.541 --> 08:06.541
I'm sorry.

08:18.250 --> 08:21.375
-Isn't she from the Wilmer advert?
-Jesus Christ, what are you doing here?

08:21.458 --> 08:22.541
How'd you get past the gate?

08:22.625 --> 08:24.083
-I told them I was your sister.
-What?

08:24.166 --> 08:26.250
We need to talk about this new business.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.708
What new business?
You cannot kidnap any of my friends again.

08:28.791 --> 08:31.416
Friends? These people,
they talk to you out of pity.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.666
You don't know these people,
so leave now, please.

08:34.750 --> 08:38.208
Rich people are the same everywhere.
Given the opportunity, they will use you.

08:38.291 --> 08:42.250
All they care about is making more money.
What's wrong with taking a little?

08:42.333 --> 08:46.000
Look, dealing
with Oga Rambo is a do-or-die affair.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.708
Let's just carry
the person he said we should carry,

08:48.791 --> 08:50.541
and then take the money,
and travel abroad.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.041
He picked someone?

08:55.333 --> 08:56.291
Yes, he has.

08:58.458 --> 08:59.791
The girl you were hugging.

09:00.333 --> 09:01.916
The one from the TV.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.208
She's our new target.

09:20.583 --> 09:23.000
One, two, three, let's go.

09:23.083 --> 09:25.458
Up, up, clean.

09:25.541 --> 09:26.833
Down.

09:26.916 --> 09:28.833
And back, back, back--

09:28.916 --> 09:31.916
Sorry, but these "steal your
boyfriend" moves aren't working.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.375
Can we please continue?

09:37.458 --> 09:39.458
How is a whore
still a cheerleading captain?

09:40.625 --> 09:41.833
Are you that shameless?

09:43.791 --> 09:44.875
If I remember,

09:45.375 --> 09:48.708
you were caught shagging someone's
boyfriend in the bathroom last year.

09:48.791 --> 09:51.958
You don't have the moral ground
for this banter, okay? Let's go, guys.

09:52.041 --> 09:54.166
This defending
people that betray you,

09:54.250 --> 09:56.000
is it how you were born
or is it the drugs?

09:56.083 --> 09:58.875
Let's take a break, everyone.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.583
Nnenna. Nnenna.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.416
What the fuck do you want?

10:28.041 --> 10:29.041
Come in.

10:33.041 --> 10:34.500
What are you doing here?

10:34.583 --> 10:36.291
Isn't it lunchtime at school?

10:39.666 --> 10:43.166
I came to deliver
the drawing your mom bought.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.541
And, of course, to check on you.

10:48.041 --> 10:49.125
So…

10:50.833 --> 10:53.625
when are you coming back to school?

10:56.083 --> 10:57.041
Frank.

10:57.916 --> 11:01.583
Um, I know that you are afraid,

11:02.250 --> 11:04.166
but school is safe now.

11:04.666 --> 11:06.791
There are security everywhere.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.916
The person that took you
is not going to be able to take you again.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
How did you know?

11:12.666 --> 11:13.666
Um…

11:15.625 --> 11:16.583
Rahila.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.333
Rahila told me.

11:19.416 --> 11:23.333
She was in the parking lot
when it happened.

11:24.125 --> 11:26.375
Frank, please come back.
Everyone misses you.

11:27.458 --> 11:29.458
All our classmates,
they are always asking about you.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.833
Even if I wanted to come back,

11:35.458 --> 11:36.958
I'm not sure my mum would let me.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.208
I'm sure

11:40.791 --> 11:43.250
if you told your mum
you wanted to come back,

11:44.041 --> 11:47.958
she would drop you and every meat pie
at Frankees by the school gate.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.166
Ah?

12:12.125 --> 12:13.458
What? Am I dreaming?

12:13.541 --> 12:14.625
Ishaya.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.041
Tell me this is not what I think it is!

12:17.125 --> 12:18.750
It's not what you think. Look.

12:18.833 --> 12:20.583
Tell me!
Oh, dear Lord!

12:20.666 --> 12:22.458
-Look.
-Art, again!

12:22.541 --> 12:25.666
This is the only way
I can provide for this family.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.250
I have to provide for our family.

12:27.833 --> 12:30.458
You promised me you wouldn't do art again.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.833
-Chasing art killed Dauda.

12:34.333 --> 12:35.958
You killed Dauda.

12:36.041 --> 12:39.416
And there's not one single day
I do not regret it.

12:45.958 --> 12:48.125
-Hey, Dad.
-Come, come.

12:49.875 --> 12:50.833
Come sit with me.

12:55.666 --> 12:56.500
Ah.

12:57.125 --> 12:58.625
It's like that now, huh?

12:59.416 --> 13:00.291
All right.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.416
What's the matter?

13:08.125 --> 13:09.458
I'm your father,

13:09.541 --> 13:14.708
and nobody in this whole wide world
can love you the way I do.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.750
So talk to me.

13:19.916 --> 13:23.458
All right.
Maybe you need to go out more?

13:24.583 --> 13:25.791
Paris.

13:26.541 --> 13:28.125
Let's go to Paris!

13:30.541 --> 13:31.875
What's the matter?

13:33.958 --> 13:35.500
Final solution.

13:36.291 --> 13:39.041
Let us make today a "yes" day.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.291
Yes?

13:43.541 --> 13:45.208
-Really?
-Yes.

13:47.666 --> 13:48.666
Hit me.

13:50.791 --> 13:53.791
Reggie has a party this weekend,
and I would like to go.

13:57.708 --> 14:01.791
Baby, that doesn't
look like a very good idea.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.166
-Dad, you said whatever I want.
-That's it?

14:04.250 --> 14:06.291
That's all you can think about?

14:06.375 --> 14:07.500
Parties.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.750
If you leave this house,
you won't like the consequences.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.041
I don't understand
why you hate me so much.

14:21.708 --> 14:24.916
Even after finding out I wasn't driving,
you still treat me like a criminal.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.958
You stole the car keys.

14:27.041 --> 14:29.500
You gave the keys to Atlas.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.250
You allowed him to drive.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.916
If you don't realize
that makes you equally responsible,

14:34.000 --> 14:35.708
than you're more stupid than I thought!

14:35.791 --> 14:37.083
Then maybe I should have died!

14:58.583 --> 14:59.666
Car?

15:00.416 --> 15:01.541
Baby?

15:02.208 --> 15:03.083
Wait for me.

15:04.458 --> 15:05.375
Please.

15:26.583 --> 15:29.333
What the fuck are you doing?
How did you know about this party?

15:29.416 --> 15:30.916
Blink. Where's your friend?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.958
-She's not here!
-Look, Ishaya.

15:33.041 --> 15:34.000
What is it?

15:34.083 --> 15:37.958
Hide her if you like, we are taking her.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.000
Why are you doing this?
What's your problem?

15:41.083 --> 15:42.458
Ishaya, you broke my heart.

15:42.541 --> 15:46.333
I went to Rambo to make you jealous,
and now he is tormenting me.

15:46.416 --> 15:48.916
And you're looking for love and riches?

15:49.583 --> 15:50.708
Never.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.375
Adufe, did you choose Carmen?

15:58.250 --> 15:59.708
The Devil is inside your heart.

15:59.791 --> 16:02.250
-Because of money?
-No, because of you.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.916
If I cannot have you, I'll have money.

16:04.750 --> 16:05.916
Didn't you use me?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.708
You used me for money,
love, even to save Rahila.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.875
Now I'm using you
to save myself from Oga Rambo.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.708
Enjoy your party.

16:21.625 --> 16:24.208
Kidnapping department
is down the corridor.

16:25.416 --> 16:28.000
Sir. Sir, please.
Please, I need your help.

16:28.875 --> 16:29.958
Please, sir.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.916
Sir, please, Adufe wants to kidnap
one of my friends again.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.708
I was at a party, she came looking
for Carmen. I need your help to stop her.

16:41.791 --> 16:43.583
Isn't that
the aim of the new business?

16:43.666 --> 16:46.500
Yes, sir, but, sir, this person
that she wants to kidnap

16:46.583 --> 16:48.333
is the daughter
of the owner of the school.

16:48.416 --> 16:51.250
If she goes through, sir,
it's a problem for you, for me,

16:51.333 --> 16:52.583
for Rush, sir.

16:53.333 --> 16:56.916
Want to share why
you're so eager to save this friend?

16:57.500 --> 16:59.416
Because you and I
know you don't care about Rush.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.750
Please.

17:01.916 --> 17:03.875
If you won't talk, get out.

17:04.916 --> 17:09.000
Okay, just promise me that
nothing will happen to Adufe.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.333
Please.

17:12.958 --> 17:13.791
Eh?

17:15.333 --> 17:16.875
Brother Government, please.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.708
Let me show you. I'll show you.

17:57.208 --> 17:58.625
You know she's trying to kidnap

17:58.708 --> 18:01.083
the daughter of the owner
of Wilmer Academy, right?

18:01.166 --> 18:03.166
It's her job. It's Adufe.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.958
If money was the motivation,

18:05.041 --> 18:07.541
yes, but she's trying
to eliminate her competition.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.416
What did she do to you?

18:19.458 --> 18:22.125
<i>Can you carry me?</i>
<i>Wait, wait, wait!</i>

18:22.208 --> 18:23.958
<i>Are you sure? Wait.</i>

18:24.041 --> 18:26.541
-<i> Wait…</i>

18:27.291 --> 18:28.291
Adufe.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.416
-No!
-You're sleeping with Ishaya?

18:31.500 --> 18:33.791
-I swear to you--
-Answer me! Are you sleeping with him?

18:33.875 --> 18:35.250
No! I was using him!

18:35.333 --> 18:37.750
I'll kill you both
if you're sleeping with him!

18:37.833 --> 18:40.750
Hundred million naira.
That's what I'm going to ask for.

18:41.583 --> 18:42.875
I'll get her.

18:42.958 --> 18:44.208
Trust me.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.208
Hundred million?

18:49.708 --> 18:50.708
Trust…

18:52.583 --> 18:53.958
We will lose Rush!

18:54.041 --> 18:57.541
This Carmen girl, her family,
they're too influential.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.375
-It's too high risk!
-I fear nobody!

19:02.250 --> 19:04.875
You have one week!
You hear me? One week!

19:04.958 --> 19:08.291
If I ever see you with Ishaya again,
I'll kill you both!

19:23.166 --> 19:25.833
So, who can tell me
why the word "mouse"

19:25.916 --> 19:27.250
is not a transitive verb?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.750
Ishaya. Yes, you. Answer the question.

19:36.458 --> 19:38.250
Does anyone know the answer?

19:39.208 --> 19:42.458
-Sir, sorry I'm late.
-Frank! Oh, my God.

19:42.541 --> 19:44.333
I missed you!

19:45.458 --> 19:46.958
Oh, my God.

19:50.833 --> 19:54.041
So, Frank.
Is it true you were kidnapped?

19:54.125 --> 19:56.666
I heard you ran away from home.
Were your parents beating you?

20:00.041 --> 20:02.250
-Can't you leave him alone?

20:02.333 --> 20:05.000
Can't you leave him alone?
Are you guys mad?

20:05.083 --> 20:06.291
Are you mad?

20:06.375 --> 20:09.500
-Are you mad? Get out of here!

20:10.333 --> 20:12.458
-Frank.

20:12.541 --> 20:13.541
Frank.

20:20.916 --> 20:21.791
Frank?

20:23.833 --> 20:24.791
Frank?

20:27.625 --> 20:28.583
Talk to me.

20:30.541 --> 20:33.375
-Don't worry about the rumors--
-It's not a rumor!

20:34.083 --> 20:35.166
I was kidnapped!

20:37.333 --> 20:39.083
I was taken here…

20:40.375 --> 20:41.958
in the parking lot.

20:43.541 --> 20:44.750
They took me.

20:45.833 --> 20:47.166
They tied me.

20:48.333 --> 20:51.291
I couldn't see anything.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.375
I couldn't hear anything.

20:53.458 --> 20:55.458
I couldn't do anything.

20:57.666 --> 21:00.208
I couldn't do anything.

21:19.166 --> 21:20.791
-Say yes.
-It'll be fun.

21:20.875 --> 21:24.166
Ishaya, did you hear?
Atlas's video was removed from Blink.

21:24.250 --> 21:27.291
He can't submit anything for the grant
because he owes school fees.

21:28.041 --> 21:30.041
-So it's just two of us.
-Wow.

21:30.125 --> 21:31.208
You reap what you sow.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.958
-Zina…
-Yes!

21:37.416 --> 21:38.458
Hey, Carmen.

21:40.458 --> 21:41.375
Please, please.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.750
-Please.

21:43.833 --> 21:45.791
Look, Carmen, I'm so sorry.

21:46.833 --> 21:48.166
I'm so sorry.

21:50.541 --> 21:52.125
I was vulnerable.

21:52.208 --> 21:55.000
Nnenna saw that and she took advantage.

21:55.583 --> 21:59.000
My dad died,
and he left Mum and I with nothing.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.541
And I couldn't afford to pay for school.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.125
I love you so much, Car, I'm so sorry.

22:06.208 --> 22:09.958
I can't even imagine what your parents
must think of me right now.

22:10.958 --> 22:13.250
I know I can kiss the grant goodbye, but…

22:13.833 --> 22:18.041
I'd do anything just so they understand
I didn't do this on purpose.

22:21.833 --> 22:22.666
Car.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Car!

22:26.916 --> 22:29.916
-Hi.

22:40.708 --> 22:42.708
Atlas, are you all right?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.500
Who the fuck are you?

22:48.125 --> 22:50.166
I can help you get back into the grant.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.666
I'm in the same class
with Ishaya and Frank,

22:54.750 --> 22:56.916
and I can tell you
a secret that will destroy Ishaya,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.875
but you have to promise me something.

23:02.083 --> 23:03.583
That you be my best friend.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.583
<i>It's not a rumor!</i>

23:09.083 --> 23:10.291
<i>I was kidnapped!</i>

23:11.625 --> 23:13.291
<i>I was taken here…</i>

23:14.541 --> 23:15.916
<i>in the parking lot.</i>

23:17.458 --> 23:19.250
<i>They took me.</i>

23:20.708 --> 23:24.875
I also know
your scholarship student is a fraud.

23:25.833 --> 23:27.208
Would you like to sit--

23:27.291 --> 23:29.541
Put my video back up and let me compete.

23:29.625 --> 23:34.583
If that's too much to ask, then I guess
I can help everyone confirm the rumors.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.125
I wish you
success in the competition.

23:55.416 --> 23:58.708
How you've managed to do this
in less than a week…

23:58.791 --> 24:00.541
It's amazing.

24:01.625 --> 24:02.666
Yeah.

24:03.625 --> 24:08.791
Okay, guys, deadline tomorrow,
so make sure you finish up.

24:08.875 --> 24:10.000
-Okay?
-Okay.

24:14.125 --> 24:16.666
You should be happy
someone can make her smile.

24:47.208 --> 24:50.166
Do you know because of you,
Oga Rambo nearly killed me?

24:54.875 --> 24:56.583
I told Government
to make sure you're safe.

24:56.666 --> 24:57.833
And you believed him?

24:58.833 --> 25:01.833
Ishaya, after all I have done
for you, you did this to me.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.500
Look, I'm sorry,

25:11.583 --> 25:13.166
but I just…

25:13.250 --> 25:14.875
I had to keep my friends safe.

25:14.958 --> 25:18.166
You didn't do this because of
your friends, you did this for her.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.166
You like her so much you betrayed me.

25:23.583 --> 25:25.541
Oga Rambo gave us one week.

25:26.625 --> 25:30.375
So if you don't want the two of us
plus your entire family to die,

25:31.583 --> 25:32.958
get her to me by Friday.

25:40.291 --> 25:42.041
-What?
-It's Ishaya.

25:46.166 --> 25:47.208
What?

25:49.375 --> 25:52.041
I don't understand.
Who the hell are you?

25:52.125 --> 25:54.500
Not only a drug dealer,
but a kidnapper as well?

25:54.583 --> 25:57.125
And you kidnapped Frank, your friend!

25:57.208 --> 25:58.958
And I'm your next target.

25:59.875 --> 26:03.875
Ishaya, how could you?
You're my best friend.

26:08.541 --> 26:09.458
Look.

26:12.333 --> 26:15.750
I know that what I've done is wrong.

26:18.041 --> 26:20.500
But it was the only way
for me to help my family.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.375
I did what I had to do to survive.

26:27.541 --> 26:30.833
Please forgive me, Frank. Please.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.875
I need to tell my father about this.

26:37.041 --> 26:39.500
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen, wait.
Carmen, please wait.

26:41.125 --> 26:42.333
I…

26:42.416 --> 26:43.750
I have a plan.

26:50.208 --> 26:51.083
Good morning, ma.

26:51.833 --> 26:52.666
I, um…

26:55.250 --> 26:56.875
I'm here to confess.

26:59.583 --> 27:01.833
Hey, here!
Open the gate now, open the gate.

27:01.916 --> 27:04.250
Don't move! Don't move!
If you move, I'll shoot you!

27:04.833 --> 27:05.916
Hey, hey!

27:08.291 --> 27:11.000
Come around here! Come around here!
Stop that man! Stop that man!

27:11.083 --> 27:13.750
-Clear this place and bring everybody out!
-Yes, sir!

27:13.833 --> 27:15.875
-Now!
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!

27:39.458 --> 27:40.333
Hold it there.

27:40.916 --> 27:43.000
Move out! Take him out!

27:43.083 --> 27:45.291
-Take him! Move.
-We're going.

28:08.583 --> 28:10.041
Is that the Oga Rambo?

28:24.833 --> 28:26.833
In my territory.

28:27.625 --> 28:28.625
Look.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.166
I will burn this city down.

28:31.250 --> 28:32.541
They can't stop me.

28:32.625 --> 28:34.000
I'm going to kill Ishaya!

28:34.083 --> 28:37.250
I'm going to kill him with my bare hands!

28:37.333 --> 28:39.083
He called the cops on me?

28:39.166 --> 28:40.208
They took from me?

28:41.125 --> 28:42.541
Baby, calm down.

28:42.625 --> 28:44.375
-Please.
-Government was right!

28:44.458 --> 28:47.583
He said I shouldn't get into the
kidnapping business! It's all your fault!

28:48.083 --> 28:49.125
I blame you!

28:49.208 --> 28:52.000
It's not my fault.
I didn't know Ishaya would betray us.

28:52.583 --> 28:55.625
I'm going to rescue Government.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.208
But first, I'm going to get my revenge.

28:58.291 --> 29:01.083
They take from me,
I will take from them!

29:01.583 --> 29:03.458
I'll show them who I am!

29:03.541 --> 29:05.666
Let's just take the money
and run to Ghana.

29:05.750 --> 29:06.916
What's in Ghana?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.500
Do you know who I am?

29:09.083 --> 29:10.041
Baido, tell her.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.416
I am Rambo!

29:11.500 --> 29:13.083
One in a billion!

29:13.166 --> 29:14.833
Rambo never runs!

29:14.916 --> 29:17.458
They won't see me coming!

29:18.041 --> 29:18.958
Baido, take!

29:20.166 --> 29:21.250
We go to war!

29:21.833 --> 29:23.250
Go get the boys.

29:23.333 --> 29:24.541
Okay.

29:28.250 --> 29:30.208
And are searching for him discreetly.

29:30.291 --> 29:33.291
I'm sure he crawled
into some hole, afraid.

29:34.291 --> 29:37.791
We need to ramp up security in the school.

29:38.333 --> 29:40.958
-But without setting off the alarm bells.
-Yes.

29:41.041 --> 29:43.125
-Please.
-Uh, sir.

29:43.208 --> 29:45.916
-Yes?
-Please, what about my family?

29:46.000 --> 29:49.208
Sir, as long as Oga Rambo
is still out there, they are not safe.

29:49.791 --> 29:53.875
Well, you should have thought about that
before you started associating with them.

29:53.958 --> 29:54.791
Exactly.

29:57.291 --> 29:58.125
Gemade.

29:59.250 --> 30:01.875
Because the school
can't afford any more scandals,

30:01.958 --> 30:06.000
you will not be expelled immediately,
but after this semester,

30:06.083 --> 30:10.291
I don't want to see your face
anywhere near this school, okay?

30:10.375 --> 30:11.500
Now get out.

30:11.583 --> 30:13.416
Me and my family are not safe.

30:17.666 --> 30:21.541
I think you guys should stay away from me,
just so you don't get into trouble.

30:23.458 --> 30:25.250
My estate security is tight.

30:25.750 --> 30:30.583
Maybe your family and you
can come stay at mine.

30:31.750 --> 30:33.125
I'm not doing this for you.

30:48.916 --> 30:51.250
-Welcome, ma'am.
-Hey. Thank you.

30:57.833 --> 30:59.875
Why is Dauda's
picture in this house?

31:01.208 --> 31:03.208
I was in the kitchen, um…

31:04.666 --> 31:07.125
Frank, can you take
your friends to their rooms?

31:07.208 --> 31:09.166
I'll send food to them shortly, okay?

31:09.250 --> 31:10.958
-Okay, Mum.
-All right.

31:12.416 --> 31:13.708
Is everything okay?

31:14.333 --> 31:15.958
Uh, that…

31:16.041 --> 31:19.750
That was our son
who passed away over a decade ago.

31:21.833 --> 31:24.333
We haven't seen this face for a long time.

31:25.166 --> 31:26.833
Oh, I'm so sorry. I…

31:26.916 --> 31:29.583
I bought this artwork
because he reminds me of Frank.

31:30.083 --> 31:31.416
I had no idea.

31:32.125 --> 31:34.000
I'm so sorry for your loss.

31:34.583 --> 31:35.583
Thank you.

31:39.083 --> 31:41.583
Looks like Wilmer
has made you a better artist.

31:49.416 --> 31:50.416
So…

31:52.166 --> 31:53.875
What are you going to do now?

31:56.416 --> 31:58.416
Because everyone
is counting on you.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.583
Hey…

32:26.791 --> 32:29.583
You said
I'm always apologizing.

32:31.125 --> 32:33.583
This time I actually want to help you.

32:35.541 --> 32:40.291
Even if it's money for rent.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.166
So…

32:43.500 --> 32:44.875
You can use it.

33:00.291 --> 33:01.166
Hey!

33:01.708 --> 33:03.916
You bastard,
what the fuck did you do to my work?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.375
I think it's only fair
you don't submit anything

33:06.458 --> 33:08.500
since you cheated to get into Wilmer.

33:09.041 --> 33:10.625
And you're a kidnapper.

33:10.708 --> 33:12.333
-It's like--
-Ishaya!

33:16.916 --> 33:17.833
What happened?

33:17.916 --> 33:20.625
I think you should ask your fave,
or check the cameras.

33:26.833 --> 33:30.291
You do know that if you did that
to his artwork, you will be disqualified.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.208
That's never going to happen.

33:44.791 --> 33:46.500
I want to submit something else.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.666
-Good afternoon, sir.
-I want to see my young brother.

34:04.750 --> 34:05.583
All right, sir.

34:05.666 --> 34:08.041
-You need to fill the form, sir.
-Baido.

34:14.708 --> 34:17.083
-Hey, don't move!

34:17.166 --> 34:19.875
-You move, I shoot you!

34:55.125 --> 34:55.958
Fuck.

35:08.916 --> 35:10.000
Run!

35:10.750 --> 35:12.750
-Everybody, hide!

35:19.291 --> 35:21.333
-I said she's going--
-Ma'am!

35:22.500 --> 35:25.916
Ma'am, kidnappers with weapons!

35:39.208 --> 35:41.000
Yo.
Nnenna, what the fuck is going on?

35:41.083 --> 35:41.916
I don't know.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.708
-Who the fuck are those guys?
-How am I supposed to fucking know?

35:46.500 --> 35:47.666
Someone's coming.

35:48.166 --> 35:51.000
-Oh, shit, shit…
-Do you know these people?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.166
-Do you know these people?
-What do you want with them?

35:54.250 --> 35:55.916
She'll take you, she knows where they are.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.791
-Are you crazy?
-Leave her alone!

36:08.041 --> 36:10.500
-Nnenna, are you okay?
-Don't fucking touch me!

36:12.666 --> 36:13.541
Hey.

36:14.333 --> 36:16.375
Daniel? David?

36:22.500 --> 36:24.166
Can you hear me? Hey!

36:25.083 --> 36:26.375
Duncan, are you okay?

36:27.083 --> 36:29.125
Oh, shit.

36:29.208 --> 36:31.750
Fuck. Fuck.

36:33.125 --> 36:34.125
Nnenna.

36:36.458 --> 36:39.916
What's taking so long?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.958
<i>We are still looking.</i>

36:42.041 --> 36:44.500
-Is it going?
-Oh, pick up the phone!

36:44.583 --> 36:45.958
Pick the up the phone! Ahh!

36:46.041 --> 36:48.625
-Pick up the phone!
-Hey, do you know these people?

36:48.708 --> 36:51.708
-I said do you know these people?
-Yeah, man, just calm down.

36:55.583 --> 36:56.583
Reggie.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.750
-What? How do you know to do that?

36:59.833 --> 37:01.666
Been a black belt
since I was ten.

37:02.333 --> 37:04.208
-We have to go.
-You want us to fight?

37:04.291 --> 37:06.541
Don't worry.
Stay behind me, I'll protect you.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.541
-I was about to tell you the same thing.
-Let's go.

37:21.125 --> 37:22.833
Carmen! Carmen…

37:23.416 --> 37:24.875
-Carmen.

37:24.958 --> 37:26.958
Oh, shit. Let's go.

37:27.041 --> 37:28.958
-I will kill you!
-Shut up!

37:37.500 --> 37:38.416
Reggie!

37:40.125 --> 37:41.458
What happened?

37:41.541 --> 37:42.750
He saved my life.

37:43.250 --> 37:45.291
When someone else hid like a pussy.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.541
-Please, I beg you, please.

37:55.125 --> 37:57.416
-Hey!

38:05.458 --> 38:07.041
-Hey!

38:07.125 --> 38:09.083
-Move!

38:09.166 --> 38:10.166
I said move!

38:11.666 --> 38:14.000
-Ishaya, are we going to die?
-Not today.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.125
- <i>Hello, boss.</i>
-You have them?

38:16.208 --> 38:17.541
<i>Yes, sir, we are coming now.</i>

38:17.625 --> 38:20.916
-Let them come.
-Hurry, boss is waiting.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.500
-Yes, sir.

38:23.583 --> 38:26.583
Police.
Let's bring them to the base.

38:26.666 --> 38:30.500
-I don't have all day!
-But the cops are coming! Go!

38:30.583 --> 38:34.833
-Ahh!
-They'll bring them to base.

38:49.750 --> 38:52.250
How did they even get into the school?

38:52.333 --> 38:54.083
-No, no, no…
-Wait, wait.

38:54.166 --> 38:56.000
Baby, wait, just…

38:57.166 --> 39:00.458
-Sir, sir, sir.
-I'm very sorry, sir, I can explain.

39:00.541 --> 39:01.916
I'm very sorry, sir.

39:03.583 --> 39:04.958
I'll meet you at the hospital.

39:10.500 --> 39:11.708
Frank!

39:11.791 --> 39:14.000
-Frank, Frank, Frank!
-Mum!

39:14.083 --> 39:16.291
-You killed my son!

39:16.375 --> 39:19.333
-Ishaya!
-I will sue every last one of you!

39:19.416 --> 39:20.375
Ishaya.

39:21.916 --> 39:22.916
Ishaya.

39:23.416 --> 39:25.125
What happened?
Come, let's go.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.166
Mr. Government, sir.

39:40.166 --> 39:41.750
Sir, I'm sorry that I--

39:41.833 --> 39:44.125
Stop.

39:45.125 --> 39:47.375
We both know you're not here to apologize.

39:50.833 --> 39:52.500
You're lucky I'm in here.

39:54.125 --> 39:55.208
So lucky.

39:57.125 --> 39:58.458
Sir, please…

40:00.916 --> 40:05.125
Sir, I didn't know who else I could go to.

40:07.250 --> 40:09.500
You know, since you've
been like a teacher for me for--

40:09.583 --> 40:10.875
I've been like a what?

40:11.875 --> 40:13.000
Like a what?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.166
A teacher.

40:15.875 --> 40:17.583
Maybe I taught you too well, huh?

40:18.666 --> 40:20.333
I'm sorry…

40:22.125 --> 40:23.250
Please, see, I…

40:24.875 --> 40:25.916
Please.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.958
I need you to help me stop Oga Rambo from
coming after me and my family. Please.

40:30.458 --> 40:31.291
Please.

40:31.375 --> 40:33.125
There's nothing you can do to stop

40:33.708 --> 40:39.166
Rambo's wrath from visiting
you and your loved ones.

40:39.791 --> 40:40.791
Sir, please…

40:41.291 --> 40:42.916
Mr. Government, please, please.

40:45.208 --> 40:46.625
Sorry. Sorry, sir.

40:47.625 --> 40:49.416
You know the only thing I regret?

40:49.916 --> 40:52.500
Not listening to my brother
in the beginning.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.125
I should have killed you.

41:03.666 --> 41:06.333
Sir, please,
I didn't want them to arrest you.

41:06.916 --> 41:09.875
Sir, I didn't want them to arrest you.
I just…

41:09.958 --> 41:11.875
I didn't want them to arrest you.

41:24.541 --> 41:25.875
Ishaya?

41:26.458 --> 41:28.083
<i>Hello, are you there?</i>

41:28.166 --> 41:30.916
<i>Adufe, please, I'm begging you,</i>
<i>I just need you to help me--</i>

41:31.000 --> 41:32.541
-Ah!
-<i>Adufe? Adufe?</i>

41:32.625 --> 41:34.083
You're going somewhere?

41:40.125 --> 41:41.500
Are you traveling?

41:44.416 --> 41:45.750
Answer me!

41:47.583 --> 41:48.791
What's in the bag?

41:54.125 --> 41:54.958
Open it.

42:09.541 --> 42:10.958
You are mad!

42:11.041 --> 42:12.125
Boss, leave her.

42:12.208 --> 42:14.000
-She's just scared.
-Are you crazy?

42:24.583 --> 42:26.583
Ishaya, you son of a bitch.

42:26.666 --> 42:27.583
Hello?

42:27.666 --> 42:28.500
You?

42:28.583 --> 42:30.916
<i>Sir, I called to speak to you.</i>

42:31.416 --> 42:34.541
<i>If I come to you,</i>
<i>will you leave my family alone?</i>

42:34.625 --> 42:37.250
What? You want to come see me?

42:37.333 --> 42:40.083
It won't go well for you.

42:41.250 --> 42:42.208
Baido.

42:43.291 --> 42:44.375
Bring Ishaya to me.

42:45.583 --> 42:46.791
Dead or alive.

42:55.125 --> 42:56.250
Where are we?

42:56.750 --> 42:59.166
Darling, your father and I
love you very much.

42:59.250 --> 43:02.708
But after recent events,
we've decided this is what's best for you.

43:03.500 --> 43:04.625
Where are we?

43:04.708 --> 43:05.875
Daddy.

43:09.125 --> 43:11.833
Daddy,
I do not need rehab, please!

43:11.916 --> 43:13.041
Car.

43:13.916 --> 43:14.750
Baby…

43:15.250 --> 43:16.958
I'm doing this for your own good.

43:17.041 --> 43:20.250
Daddy, I swear, I…
I promise I will never use again.

43:22.291 --> 43:24.625
-Daddy, one last chance.
- We love you.

43:24.708 --> 43:27.666
Enough! You can't get
your father to change his mind.

43:27.750 --> 43:28.750
Daddy!

43:32.125 --> 43:33.791
How could you do this to me?

43:42.208 --> 43:43.125
Daddy.

43:43.916 --> 43:44.833
Please, Car.

43:45.541 --> 43:47.541
This is very difficult for me. Please.

43:55.750 --> 43:58.416
-Daddy…
-I'm sorry, baby.

44:02.458 --> 44:03.375
Don't touch me!

44:25.708 --> 44:28.666
Oga Rambo, please.
Please, you need to calm down.

44:28.750 --> 44:29.833
I beg, please.

44:29.916 --> 44:31.833
-Please.
-You had Government arrested!

44:31.916 --> 44:32.791
No, sir.

44:32.875 --> 44:36.916
Your family
will join you in hell. I warned you.

44:37.625 --> 44:38.875
Today, you die.

44:38.958 --> 44:42.291
After I kill you,
I'll kill your entire family.

44:43.291 --> 44:45.875
-You will die.

44:45.958 --> 44:47.375
Die, you bastard!

44:56.541 --> 44:58.833
Baido, carry him out.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.625
What are
you going to do to him, eh?

45:12.666 --> 45:13.958
I have a deal for you.

45:14.041 --> 45:15.416
Come and work for me.

45:47.875 --> 45:49.208
-Ishaya.

45:51.250 --> 45:53.833
Please, put this back, and… and come.

46:12.250 --> 46:13.208
Take.

46:16.500 --> 46:19.750
Use it to get another place to… to live.

46:24.750 --> 46:27.333
You have brought
so much trouble to this family.

46:29.541 --> 46:31.666
I need to take care of my own,

46:31.750 --> 46:33.500
but I can't do it with you here.

46:36.250 --> 46:37.291
All the best.
