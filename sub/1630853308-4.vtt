WEBVTT

01:53.906 --> 01:56.408
I've been waiting for hours.
She's been there all night.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.785
Look out the window.
The sun is fucking coming up.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.829
I'm sorry.
You're gonna need to take a seat.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.915
Well, where's the doctor?
Where's the doctor?

02:02.998 --> 02:05.626
-I wanna talk to him. Where's the doctor?
-She's on her way.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.044
Just let me see
my daughter Sharon.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.047
I'd like to actually get
some answers, okay?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.007
Please take a seat.
We'll be able to help you soon.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.260
Who's your supervisor?
This is not okay.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.513
-He'll be here soon.
-I just wanna see her.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.349
-Ma'am, I understand.
-Yeah, yeah. Unbelievable.

02:20.432 --> 02:22.142
Sir, this is a restricted area.

02:42.538 --> 02:43.872
Are you serious right now?

02:45.415 --> 02:48.460
There's a hundred other
fucking chairs here. Pick one.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.504
I'm already in this one.

02:52.881 --> 02:56.301
Just go away.
I can't deal with whatever this is.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.511
No, I understand.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.180
Waiting's no fun.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.641
Nurses don't tell you nothing,

03:02.724 --> 03:04.935
and the doctors don't do their rounds
till 7:00.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.729
Fuck.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.110
Who you waiting for?

03:16.238 --> 03:17.239
My daughter.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.659
Why is she here?

03:26.582 --> 03:28.125
The critical cases get seen to first.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.086
So, if your daughter needs a specialist,
you'll be waiting here a while.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.463
You a doctor?

03:33.547 --> 03:34.548
No, I…

03:40.971 --> 03:42.556
Been on this side of it before.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.142
It's…

03:47.603 --> 03:48.979
It's hard not knowing.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.816
She was on the beach.
What the fuck was she doing on the beach?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.195
Your daughter was?

03:56.987 --> 03:58.322
That's what the cops said.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.617
She could've walked
that shitty dog anywhere.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.453
It's the middle of the night. And what?
She wants to go for a swim?

04:06.205 --> 04:07.789
Well, maybe she just wanted it to herself.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.876
You know, the beach.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.962
Why the fuck would she want that?

04:14.463 --> 04:16.673
Someone cuts her open,
just leaves her there.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.341
I'm sorry.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.594
Don't be sorry. She's not dying.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.639
Hey, hey! Don't walk away from me.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.766
Where's the doctor?
Okay. Where's the doctor?

04:25.849 --> 04:28.477
-She's on her way--
-She's on her way?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.437
-You said that hours ago.
-You need to wait for her.

04:30.521 --> 04:33.232
-Where's the doctor?
-I know. Like I said--

04:33.315 --> 04:36.527
I am not moving
until the doctor comes here.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.029
I am not moving. I mean, what is going on?

04:40.864 --> 04:43.617
I've been waiting for five hours.
When is her shift done?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.834
How'd you get here, Sharon?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.712
Hey. You can't be in here.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.756
Wrong room. Sorry.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.012
Come on. Let's go, now!

06:41.026 --> 06:44.321
I'm waiting on
the '87 Bulls stats. It's under Royko.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.791
One was found in Bronzeville,
the other one in Englewood.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.459
The furthest out was Berwyn.

06:57.543 --> 06:58.752
There's seven women here.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.838
Over a 20-year spread.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.548
And there's probably more.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.216
Your source can't be CPD.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.343
I haven't run any of this by them yet.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.845
Then how can you be so sure?

07:10.472 --> 07:14.268
Someone had been calling Julia
for weeks before her murder.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.644
She recorded him.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.231
-I got the tapes. And now--
-Wait.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.191
Does the DA know you have them?

07:21.275 --> 07:23.193
We're just stealing evidence now?

07:23.277 --> 07:26.780
And my source recognized the voice
on Julia's recordings.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.575
It's the same man who attacked her.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.077
Wait, your source is a victim?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.912
She's the one who brought the story to me.

07:33.996 --> 07:37.165
And she's refusing to be featured.
Even if we keep her anonymous.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.918
Abby, I don't need a survivor.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.715
I'll do the legwork. I'll connect
the women. And I'll confirm what we have.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.341
Let me see that file.
Let me see.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.094
-Look at what he's gotten away with.
-I got it.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.096
Wrap up the flood.
Help Dan on this.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.514
I can cover Daley's conference for you.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.641
No.
We don't need a presence there right now.

07:54.725 --> 07:58.478
If we don't go, he'll notice,
and he'll punish us for it later.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.366
Here.
I pulled background on Summer Francis.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.662
How'd it go?
Geez, they beat you up in there?

08:15.746 --> 08:17.414
All good. More work to do.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.001
Okay, so we covered Summer's murder.
We did a feature.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.252
Marcus pulled the negatives,

08:22.336 --> 08:24.588
and he found a shot of
what was inside Summer.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.842
-You have any other ones?
-This was it.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.096
You put Marcus up to this morning?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.640
-Up to what?
-He came to the meeting.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.686
You two just never talk?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.188
Look.

08:42.731 --> 08:46.276
This is a key to a staff locker
at the Adler Planetarium.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.112
A woman who works there
lost the identical one.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.572
When did you find all this out?

08:50.656 --> 08:53.283
Last night.
I called you, but you didn't pick up.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.912
Summer Francis died in '72.
And this woman is working there now?

08:56.995 --> 08:59.665
-Yeah, but she lost her key two weeks ago.
-So, it's not the same one.

09:03.877 --> 09:08.131
I have to cover seven murders
without the primary source.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.759
I can still help you.
I'll reach out to the families.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.220
Some woman loses her keys last week,

09:13.303 --> 09:15.973
and you're trying to connect this
to a murder that happened 20 years ago.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.641
I don't know
how that's supposed to help me.

09:17.724 --> 09:22.104
You wanna help? I need someone
to pick up the Madrigal tapes.

09:26.316 --> 09:30.696
You should head over now,
'cause Warren closes up shop by 3:00.

09:43.625 --> 09:44.668
Fuck.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.300
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.885
Those Francis negatives, they work out?

09:53.844 --> 09:55.679
We're going in a different direction.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.558
It's a big story.
Probably a lot of directions it could go.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.562
Is that what the meeting
was about this morning?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.774
You couldn't go.
I thought one of us should.

10:11.904 --> 10:12.905
Where you headed?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.241
I'm going to go pick up tapes
in the South Loop.

10:16.325 --> 10:18.035
-The Madrigal recordings?
-Yeah.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.244
I'll come with.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.208
Fill you in on where Abby left it.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.419
All right.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.348
That key chain in the photo,

10:39.431 --> 10:42.601
you sure it couldn't have gotten mixed in
from some other spread?

10:43.143 --> 10:46.647
I blew that up from the negative
you gave me, the one of Summer Francis.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.405
Hey. What are you doing?

10:55.906 --> 10:58.450
Trying to get the pictures
of those women out of my head.

10:58.534 --> 10:59.826
Replace it with something nice.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.414
Yeah, give me one more.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.336
There you are, my sunny bride.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.090
I like that one.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.842
I appreciate the time. Thank you.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.010
Was that the Lower sister?

11:17.094 --> 11:20.347
Did you talk to the guy at Northwestern?

11:20.430 --> 11:24.309
Yeah, he said the incisions
could be religious or anti-religious,

11:24.393 --> 11:27.479
or just some bad memory
connected to a cross.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.356
What about leaving stuff
inside the victims?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.440
What does that mean?

11:30.524 --> 11:33.694
He doesn't have enough context,
and we can't quote him on any of this.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.821
Hey, the detective who worked
Catherine Moore's case,

11:35.904 --> 11:38.031
she's retired,
but she's open to helping us.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.617
-She'll make a few calls.
-But will she share her original notes?

11:40.701 --> 11:42.327
I can ask. She'll say no.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.454
-Matty from the Tribune called.
-Who?

11:44.538 --> 11:46.164
Matty Spears, their new city editor.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.041
He heard you stopped by
the property locker.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.626
How'd they get that?

11:51.420 --> 11:53.964
Did you give a retired detective
the other women's names?

11:55.549 --> 11:56.550
Fuck.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.469
So, they have all the same victims
you turned up.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.807
We could print tonight.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.228
Listen…

12:09.313 --> 12:10.522
just as a holding piece.

12:11.023 --> 12:14.193
Two paragraphs for each victim,
and then we tease there's more to come.

12:14.276 --> 12:16.904
Without your source,
it reads like random murders.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.488
There's other ways to link 'em.

12:19.198 --> 12:20.490
How he picked the women,

12:20.574 --> 12:23.076
what they have in common,
the objects that he left inside of them.

12:23.702 --> 12:24.745
I can find those connections.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.291
You call your retired detective back

12:29.374 --> 12:31.335
and at least get her
to confirm her case details.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.837
We need something on the record
from the police.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.926
Meet us down by the pier.
See you there.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.346
It should be right here.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.936
What's this guy's deal?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.530
Come on straight back.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.538
Hi. Did Dan send you?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.874
-Yeah. We're with the Sun-Times.
-That's the outputs over there.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.544
Everything I could isolate
off the noise floor is in the report.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.632
This is all of them? Thank you.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.809
All right.
This one with the background noises.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.395
-Would you mind cuing it up?
-Sure. I charge by the hour.

13:32.396 --> 13:33.480
Dan will cover it.

13:34.231 --> 13:35.232
Yeah. Thank you.

13:40.779 --> 13:41.780
Quality's rough.

13:42.698 --> 13:44.950
She was using her answering machine
to record the calls.

13:48.704 --> 13:51.373
August 13th. 3:03 p.m.

13:51.957 --> 13:52.958
Hello?

13:53.709 --> 13:55.919
For the first couple of days,
it's all hang-ups.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.004
Hello?

13:58.338 --> 14:00.799
-Hear that?
-Yeah. Tornado warning.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.509
Sound like air-raid sirens.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.511
Where'd you serve?

14:05.262 --> 14:07.055
1st Cav. A Shau Valley.

14:09.183 --> 14:12.060
1990. That must've been
the Plainfield tornado, right?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.771
You were real pissed
when I went to shoot that.

14:18.275 --> 14:20.819
Those tornado warnings,
they were all over the city.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.362
So, he could've been anywhere.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.447
I pulled what was there.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.907
Hello?

14:25.407 --> 14:26.533
I called the police.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.204
They'll be there in 18 minutes.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.456
They're here now.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.999
-No, they're not.
-Is that him?

14:35.918 --> 14:38.045
-Yeah.
-You see, I'm…

14:38.754 --> 14:40.464
I'm already with you when they arrive.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.258
Can you cue up the first time he called?

14:44.468 --> 14:46.929
-Sure.
-I'm with you every moment. I'm--

14:49.264 --> 14:50.265
Hello?

14:50.974 --> 14:54.228
Hello? Why are you doing this?

14:56.522 --> 14:57.981
How are you doing this?

14:58.065 --> 14:59.816
Just a lot of breathing after that.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.319
-What's with the echo?
-Probably the line.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.906
You get that if there's network hops.
Water damage in the wiring can do it too.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.200
Here, I'll pull the two apart for you.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.661
Here's the first one.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.831
Hello? Hello?

15:16.083 --> 15:17.376
Why are you doing this?

15:18.293 --> 15:19.878
How are you doing this?

15:23.507 --> 15:24.675
Now, here's the echo.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.928
Hello? Hello?

15:28.762 --> 15:31.723
Why are you doing this?
How are you doing this?

15:33.350 --> 15:35.477
It's different.
She doesn't sound the same.

15:35.561 --> 15:37.563
The first one's filtered
like it was recorded.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.231
The second is her voice on the line.

15:40.899 --> 15:44.862
He's playing a recording of her
before she even says the words?

15:45.362 --> 15:47.489
Let me play them again side by side.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.202
Hello? Hello?

15:53.328 --> 15:54.872
Why are you doing this?

15:56.123 --> 15:57.875
How are you doing this?

16:53.388 --> 16:54.848
What the fuck? What the--

16:54.932 --> 16:56.099
Take it! Take whatever!

16:56.683 --> 16:58.810
-Why are you here?
-I live here. What the fuck?

16:58.894 --> 17:00.437
Why are you here?

17:01.188 --> 17:02.189
I live here.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.775
What do you want? Just take whatever.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.904
-Where's Sharon?
-Who?

17:10.489 --> 17:11.656
How long have you lived here?

17:11.740 --> 17:13.200
-What?
-How long?

17:13.282 --> 17:14.826
I don't know, like, four years.

17:14.910 --> 17:18.454
No, Sharon lives here.
I know she does. Where is she?

17:19.665 --> 17:24.044
I don't know. I don't know any Sharon!
I don't know where she is.

17:24.752 --> 17:25.796
Who lived here before you?

17:25.878 --> 17:28.632
-What?
-Before you, who lived here?

17:28.715 --> 17:31.760
Some old dude. Still get his mail.
There's no place to send it.

17:31.844 --> 17:33.095
I think he's dead. Do you want it?

17:33.178 --> 17:34.179
Shut up!

17:52.072 --> 17:53.657
That breaks, and you're dead.

18:30.903 --> 18:31.904
Hey, you good?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.156
You heard that, right?

18:34.239 --> 18:35.449
I don't know what I heard.

18:36.366 --> 18:40.370
He knew what she was gonna say.
He recorded her before she even said it.

18:41.872 --> 18:44.249
Are you sure you never got
any calls like that?

18:47.753 --> 18:49.087
I didn't know what it was.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.841
I had just started working at the Tribune.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.802
Wasn't that like years before
what happened to you?

18:55.886 --> 18:56.887
Yeah.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.598
It was just a few hang-ups
at that office and…

18:59.681 --> 19:00.682
Then what?

19:06.563 --> 19:09.483
-You don't have to do this.
-Do what?

19:09.566 --> 19:10.984
Ask me questions. And it's--

19:11.068 --> 19:14.154
What the fuck are you talking about?
I should be your first stop.

19:14.238 --> 19:17.074
I don't wanna have to be in a meeting
to find out what's going on with you.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.826
Were there any other times?

19:25.457 --> 19:27.960
This is not what I had in my head.

19:29.461 --> 19:30.587
What'd you expect?

19:31.255 --> 19:33.757
I mean, you said this place was like
a second home.

19:34.508 --> 19:35.676
It's a pretty big one.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.512
Yeah, it feels smaller with the crowds.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.973
Your mom would
just let you wander around here?

19:41.557 --> 19:45.018
Well, she worked the 2:00 a.m. show
three times a week,

19:46.270 --> 19:49.773
and she couldn't pay for a babysitter.
So, this was it.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.248
Hey, what are you looking for?

20:10.627 --> 20:11.628
Kirby?

20:14.548 --> 20:15.841
What are you doing?

20:15.924 --> 20:18.010
It should still be here.
Everything else is.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.228
I don't understand what it adds.

20:28.312 --> 20:30.230
It adds texture.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.608
Jesus, this is not some garage shit.

20:32.691 --> 20:33.692
Hey, Mom.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.776
-Hey, Sharon.
-Hey.

20:34.860 --> 20:37.070
My throat is dry.
Why is it so cold in here?

20:37.154 --> 20:39.072
You wanted a clean demo. No crowds.

20:41.867 --> 20:43.285
I'm gonna blow a vocal cord.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.537
Thanks, baby.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.001
Which one of you did that?

20:54.922 --> 20:56.548
And they're gone like this song.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.425
What?

20:58.509 --> 21:01.345
Leonard Cohen.
I play it for you all the time.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.224
Maybe you have a secret admirer.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.100
Don't let it go to your head.

21:07.601 --> 21:09.144
What's got you all worked up?

21:11.188 --> 21:14.107
Tommy got a tape to Vee
over at Touch and Go.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.277
So, I mean, they didn't put up a lot for--

21:17.361 --> 21:20.864
But they're gonna cover a promo
and distro and--

21:21.823 --> 21:23.367
Yeah, it'll be 50-50 split.

21:23.825 --> 21:26.203
It's gonna be good.
Do you want me to stay?

21:27.246 --> 21:30.541
Well, I wouldn't want to disrupt
your office drone routine.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.292
Give it a fucking rest.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.253
It's a newspaper. It's--

21:34.336 --> 21:35.796
This guy.

21:35.879 --> 21:40.300
He's played for half his life,
and he still can't work a delay pedal!

21:41.260 --> 21:43.971
-You think you can do better?
-Yeah, I think I can.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.639
And Sharon--

21:45.722 --> 21:50.227
Sharon, I know that climbing
the corporate ladder is a lot, but--

21:50.310 --> 21:52.062
Why do I fucking sound like
I'm in Siberia?

21:52.145 --> 21:53.355
You said, "Monster reverb."

21:53.438 --> 21:55.941
Yeah, monster.
Like big, not like inaudible.

21:56.942 --> 21:58.610
Will you get it? Tell them it's closed.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.697
-That's not my job anymore.
-Well, I am trying to do my job--

22:01.780 --> 22:04.741
You can either be farther back in the mix
and delayed or up close and crisp.

22:04.825 --> 22:07.244
-Just fucking turn me off.
-You can't be both.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.162
-Turn me the fuck off.
-You can't do both.

22:09.246 --> 22:11.164
Hey. Sid's. We're closed right now.

22:11.248 --> 22:12.791
Jesus. Turn your music down.

22:18.714 --> 22:20.382
What the fuck?

22:20.883 --> 22:22.342
What the fuck?

22:24.636 --> 22:27.181
Yeah. Yes, yes. More. More!

22:28.265 --> 22:29.266
What?

22:31.977 --> 22:33.061
I fucking told you.

22:33.145 --> 22:35.314
Sharon! Get over here.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.982
I fucking told you.

22:37.065 --> 22:40.319
Sharon! Get over here.
Bring me another tube.

22:55.751 --> 22:59.546
I was just like Julia. He was here.

23:03.133 --> 23:06.136
When you first got the calls,
you never told Rachel?

23:07.888 --> 23:11.433
What would I have said?
It would've seemed crazy.

23:12.017 --> 23:16.396
And then the calls just stopped.
But he didn't. He just waited.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.401
I just never realized it was him.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.075
Catherine wouldn't go out on her own.

23:28.158 --> 23:29.952
I always had to knock on doors with her.

23:30.035 --> 23:33.247
We tried to hit 20 doors an hour.
We covered a lot of ground.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.415
This was Mayor Washington's
first campaign, right?

23:35.499 --> 23:36.333
Yeah.

23:36.416 --> 23:39.419
Was she political?
She ever volunteer for any campaigns?

23:40.587 --> 23:42.840
No. Anne cared about other things.

23:42.923 --> 23:45.259
About her family.
About me. People around her.

23:45.884 --> 23:47.761
Margot went with this nice kid.

23:47.845 --> 23:49.471
He was in Carpenters Local 13.

23:49.555 --> 23:51.557
She didn't live alone?

23:51.640 --> 23:54.393
No. It would have been
them two and a little girl.

23:54.935 --> 23:57.062
Bonnie, Betty, something like that.

23:57.145 --> 23:58.355
She had a daughter?

23:58.438 --> 24:00.357
Karen never talked about kids.

24:01.066 --> 24:05.487
She was studying music
but switched to nursing when I got sick.

24:08.448 --> 24:11.827
She worked at Provident Hospital?

24:11.910 --> 24:12.911
Yeah.

24:12.995 --> 24:16.999
She got her real estate license in 1985?

24:17.082 --> 24:18.458
Yeah, just before she got killed.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.377
Yeah. She ever show any places
on the South Side?

24:20.460 --> 24:21.545
No. We were in Andersonville.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.797
We spent the entire summer canvassing
the South Side.

24:23.881 --> 24:28.177
Which neighborhoods?
Maybe Englewood? Bronzeville?

24:28.260 --> 24:29.845
No, just Woodlawn.

24:29.928 --> 24:31.680
Between your care and the hospital,

24:31.763 --> 24:33.849
she must not have had time
for much else, right?

24:33.932 --> 24:36.768
She didn't mind. She liked being home.

24:36.852 --> 24:38.729
They weren't married. I remember that.

24:38.812 --> 24:40.814
Which was a much bigger deal back then.

24:40.898 --> 24:43.650
Any of these other women volunteer for it?

24:43.734 --> 24:45.694
-I'm sorry. I don't know any of them.
-I don't know.

24:45.777 --> 24:48.864
Maybe she met them at church,
a bar, club?

24:49.990 --> 24:52.201
Did she know any of these women?

24:52.284 --> 24:53.493
…involved with any of these women?

24:53.577 --> 24:54.828
Any of these women?

24:54.912 --> 24:56.038
Know any of these women?

24:56.622 --> 24:58.373
I don't understand.
What's your story about?

25:13.555 --> 25:15.474
You lived with Summer over in Kenwood?

25:16.350 --> 25:18.727
You mean,
how did I climb from there to here?

25:19.228 --> 25:21.897
I'm a libel attorney, and this is America.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.901
Is that how you guys met? Law school?

25:26.401 --> 25:28.737
We met partying. We were 20.

25:30.364 --> 25:33.534
Must have been hard
losing your roommate at that age.

25:34.243 --> 25:36.870
Roommate?
Is that what the police told you?

25:40.666 --> 25:41.959
They miss everything, right?

25:44.461 --> 25:49.758
Did either of you come across
any of these women?

25:52.886 --> 25:54.596
I don't know. Maybe she did.

25:55.097 --> 25:57.599
Summer changed a lot
right before it happened.

25:59.017 --> 26:00.227
Like how?

26:00.310 --> 26:02.271
She got quiet, distant.

26:02.855 --> 26:04.022
Do you know why?

26:04.773 --> 26:09.278
I thought she was seeing someone else,
but I never asked.

26:09.361 --> 26:12.364
I figured she'd break up with me
if I pushed too hard.

26:13.115 --> 26:18.245
But she never said anything,
like a name or somewhere she went?

26:18.328 --> 26:19.454
Something like that.

26:21.415 --> 26:23.667
I kept thinking what we did wrong.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.170
Went to the wrong parties,
knew the wrong people.

26:26.253 --> 26:27.504
There were plenty.

26:27.588 --> 26:30.632
But it still never made any fucking sense.

26:34.303 --> 26:35.304
I kept some photos.

26:36.388 --> 26:38.724
You can see for yourself
how beautiful she was.

26:48.650 --> 26:51.320
We spent a couple of summers in Saugatuck.

26:52.446 --> 26:57.701
Yeah. Took a few watercolor classes.
Puttered around.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.661
That was more her speed than Kenwood.

27:01.705 --> 27:02.789
You mind if I…

27:12.299 --> 27:14.218
Her grandmother gave her that
for some birthday.

27:19.723 --> 27:21.183
-What's wrong?
-Give me a sec.

27:33.779 --> 27:34.905
Was this Summer's?

27:36.782 --> 27:39.826
Yeah. Yeah, it was a part of the set.
Where's this from?

27:40.994 --> 27:43.872
Did you know this woman? Did Summer?

27:45.290 --> 27:47.459
I don't think so. Why?

27:52.840 --> 27:54.883
You gonna tell Dan about Sid's?

27:56.051 --> 27:57.052
You don't think I should?

27:58.220 --> 28:01.139
No, I don't. It'll end up
in his fourth graph as filler.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.643
Hey, hey. You pulling an all-nighter?

28:04.726 --> 28:06.436
Yeah, we're breaking
Dan's cold case murders.

28:07.020 --> 28:08.897
-Tonight?
-Kirby, wait.

28:09.690 --> 28:11.525
Fuck. I need her to pull
like a hundred clips.

28:11.608 --> 28:13.485
How are you going to press already?

28:13.569 --> 28:16.780
Where you been?
You were gone, like, six hours. Come here.

28:20.868 --> 28:23.579
So, this…

28:25.873 --> 28:27.374
belonged to Summer Francis.

28:30.502 --> 28:33.630
And this was found with Margot Zelle.

28:41.889 --> 28:44.308
He took the mirror from one
and left it in another.

28:44.808 --> 28:47.352
These women don't know each other.

28:47.978 --> 28:50.022
They don't have anything in common.

28:50.105 --> 28:51.773
He is the one connecting them.

28:54.902 --> 28:57.196
Willie Rose was left with a pin.

29:00.908 --> 29:06.079
Let me see. It's a nurse's pin.

29:07.956 --> 29:09.374
Karen worked at Provident Hospital.

29:09.958 --> 29:12.044
He took it from Karen,
left it with Willie.

29:14.254 --> 29:15.464
What was found in Karen?

29:18.967 --> 29:21.261
Catherine Moore.
Whose campaign did she work on?

29:22.179 --> 29:23.597
Harold Washington.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.433
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Yeah?

29:26.517 --> 29:28.352
What was
Harold Washington's campaign slogan?

29:29.520 --> 29:30.687
"The silence is deafening."

29:35.317 --> 29:37.402
This, this is Catherine's.

29:37.986 --> 29:39.947
Julia, Julia. She was a social worker.

29:40.030 --> 29:43.116
Were there any other kind of IDs
or anything like that?

29:43.617 --> 29:44.701
Catholic, right?

29:45.744 --> 29:47.621
Safe guess. She was from Jefferson Park.

29:47.704 --> 29:50.499
The devotional card could be hers.
Found with Anne Lower.

29:54.211 --> 29:58.298
Anne was killed in '85 and Julia in '90.

29:58.382 --> 30:01.385
So, he must have taken the card
from Anne by then.

30:01.468 --> 30:04.346
But he doesn't kill Julia
for another five years.

30:06.431 --> 30:08.016
What is he doing all that time?

30:09.226 --> 30:11.979
He watched us,
sometimes for years.

30:12.062 --> 30:14.022
We didn't know he was there,
not until he wanted us to.

30:14.106 --> 30:15.524
How did no one catch on to him?

30:15.607 --> 30:18.777
'Cause he picked random victims.
He moved around. He kept his distance.

30:18.861 --> 30:21.947
He didn't, though.
He got close. He knew all about us.

30:22.531 --> 30:24.950
-Knew what?
-We need to run with what we have.

30:25.033 --> 30:27.828
We should start with Julia.
She's been our coverage so far.

30:32.416 --> 30:36.128
You should lead with me.
I'll give you a firsthand account.

30:36.211 --> 30:39.006
You can have my police report,
hospital photos, whatever you need.

30:41.717 --> 30:44.720
If we include all that,
we will not be able to hide who you are.

30:44.803 --> 30:45.804
I know.

30:48.140 --> 30:51.894
You sure?
We can make do with what we have.

30:52.561 --> 30:57.024
I'm the better story.
That's what I want for this.

30:58.901 --> 31:00.402
Pawel's hearing is wrapping up.

31:00.485 --> 31:03.488
We need to make a show of offering
the police a chance to comment.

31:11.121 --> 31:12.414
Let's go, Dan.

31:29.223 --> 31:33.060
Let's go. We gotta get there
before the press conference.

31:39.316 --> 31:40.317
What is it?

31:40.400 --> 31:42.819
The key. From the planetarium.

31:42.903 --> 31:45.405
I should talk to the woman who lost it.
Let her know all of this.

31:45.489 --> 31:46.823
You still think she's connected?

31:47.699 --> 31:49.535
He took her key. She has to be.

31:52.621 --> 31:56.124
Take this in case she wants to see it.

31:56.208 --> 31:57.209
Okay.

32:28.949 --> 32:29.950
Hello?

32:30.450 --> 32:33.412
Hi, I'm Kirby Mazrachi.
I asked you about the key chain you lost.

32:33.912 --> 32:35.873
Okay. Why are you here?

32:37.291 --> 32:40.586
Your key, it was found
on a woman who was murdered.

32:41.587 --> 32:43.881
The photo I showed you was
from a crime scene.

33:00.397 --> 33:01.899
Thank you for letting me up.

33:10.616 --> 33:14.536
I've never had any hang-ups,
no weird calls, nothing like that.

33:14.620 --> 33:17.915
-Not even years ago?
-Never. None of this is happening to me.

33:19.082 --> 33:20.292
Try to really think back.

33:20.375 --> 33:23.712
I mean, if there was some heavy breather
outside my window, I would know.

33:24.296 --> 33:27.633
I didn't. I was assaulted by the same man.

33:33.722 --> 33:34.973
I'm really sorry.

33:35.766 --> 33:39.019
He watched me for years. I had no idea.

33:39.811 --> 33:41.522
Well, I'm not you.

33:42.189 --> 33:46.151
Then why was your key
left inside a dead woman?

33:47.986 --> 33:50.614
But you said this photo was
from 20 years ago.

33:54.076 --> 33:56.245
You're sure those were only made
last year?

33:56.328 --> 33:59.831
Yes. Hubble returned
its first picture of Jupiter.

33:59.915 --> 34:00.958
We did a whole exhibit.

34:02.334 --> 34:04.086
Look, I don't know
what you want me to do.

34:04.169 --> 34:09.507
Stay with friends, family.
Don't go out on your own. I carry a knife.

34:13.971 --> 34:15.472
I'm sorry. I have to get going.

34:18.016 --> 34:20.185
-I'm covering the midnight show, so--
-Sure.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.032
We won't be able to see shit tonight.

34:34.699 --> 34:36.827
You should really figure out
how you lost that key.

34:39.121 --> 34:40.121
Still have mine.

34:43.250 --> 34:47.462
He left something with those other women.
What about you?

34:48.630 --> 34:49.672
A matchbook.

34:51.216 --> 34:52.217
Whose was it?

34:53.510 --> 34:54.636
I don't know.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.264
It's from some bar
that doesn't even exist.

34:59.892 --> 35:02.186
Just because something hasn't happened yet
doesn't mean it won't.

35:02.811 --> 35:05.856
It always takes looking at something
a few times before it makes sense.

35:05.939 --> 35:08.901
If you figure it all out, give me a call.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.751
-Can I grab the red one?
-Five bucks.

37:50.979 --> 37:52.481
You don't look right.

37:56.485 --> 37:57.778
What's wrong with your hair?

37:59.863 --> 38:04.535
Stopped by your place.
Somebody else was living there.

38:06.453 --> 38:07.913
-I don't know who y--
-When did you move?

38:13.710 --> 38:14.962
You didn't know Jinny.

38:16.255 --> 38:18.382
I know you didn't.
None of you knew each other.

38:20.717 --> 38:21.927
How did you find her?

38:23.303 --> 38:24.513
Or did she find you?

38:25.514 --> 38:28.058
Yeah, maybe that's it,
'cause she's smarter than you are.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.727
Stop. Fucking stop.

38:30.811 --> 38:34.648
You look different.
I don't like you like this.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.116
You remember me…

38:46.577 --> 38:47.578
from Eldridge Street?

38:51.206 --> 38:52.875
You gave me the horse.

38:53.458 --> 38:56.420
The Pegasus. It had wings.
Horses are just hooves and tails.

38:57.212 --> 38:58.213
I--

39:01.133 --> 39:02.551
You look the same.

39:04.595 --> 39:05.971
And you look different.

39:08.932 --> 39:10.142
Nothing like I left you.

39:11.602 --> 39:14.479
I killed you. You shouldn't be here.

39:22.988 --> 39:24.156
Did you do that?

39:31.371 --> 39:34.333
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening here.

39:42.132 --> 39:43.175
Who are you?
