00:14.120 --> 00:17.480
In three hours, Heller will be tried
for war crimes against humanity.

00:17.560 --> 00:21.400
If he is proven guilty, he will be executed
in accordance with our laws.

00:21.480 --> 00:25.520
When the trial begins,
you may have an opportunity to escape.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.200
You have to take it, even if it's dangerous.

00:29.680 --> 00:33.760
When Dad told me to take the briefcase
to Omar, Debbie followed me.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.120
Debbie saw the warehouse
where we're holding Heller?

00:36.200 --> 00:41.800
Yes. Father found out and he wants me to
get her over here. You know what that means.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.560
- Debbie, thank you for coming.
- Sure.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.240
I need you to build a firewall
around station four.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.200
- " Who's that?
- Marianne.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.840
I want to make sure
she doesn't stray from her area.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.920
Fine.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.960
Listen. The terrorists will try and execute
Heller in less than three hours.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.080
- Bring him in.
- I don't think that's the right call.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.959
I believe that they'll lead me
to Heller and the kidnappers.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.760
Jack Bauer is no longer
cooperating with this investigation.

01:07.840 --> 01:12.960
All departments need to work on the capture
of Jack Bauer and the hostile he's tracking.

01:13.360 --> 01:18.640
Our first priority is to find these terrorists.
I'll need satellite surveillance to track them.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.560
You want me to steal
satellite bandwidth from CTU.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.800
Yes.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.880
Will I have satellite coverage
in the next minute or two?

01:26.960 --> 01:29.280
lt'll take at least five.

01:29.360 --> 01:33.120
" I'm gonna have to figure out a way
to keep this guy here. Keep working on it.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.360
Everybody put your hands up now!
You, don't move.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.840
Slowly move back to the corner.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.680
Everybody, just stay calm.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.960
We'll be out of here before you know it.

02:05.480 --> 02:09.680
You, hop up on the counter,
black out that camera.

02:14.200 --> 02:18.400
Anybody else working in the back?
Put your hands up.

02:19.280 --> 02:22.280
Move over there with the others. Now!

02:34.840 --> 02:38.840
- " Do you have the IDs of the other two?"
- If I did, I'd tell you.

02:38.920 --> 02:42.880
- " I'll keep you updated."
- " Thank you, yeah. Please do.

02:42.960 --> 02:47.760
Briefing in five minutes. County just reported
that Andrew Paige was taken into their ER.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.640
Paige? The programmer
Jack went to pick up?

02:50.720 --> 02:55.640
That's not all. The bodies of two unidentified
Middle Eastern men were found at the site.

02:55.720 --> 02:59.160
- Gunshot wounds.
- Bauer must have done that to save the kid.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.880
- Where did they find all this?
- Moorpark.

03:01.960 --> 03:05.800
It's out of control. We lose an agent
and a witness has been disabled.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.400
- What about the hostile and Bauer?
- Still at large.

03:09.480 --> 03:13.680
Erin, we've less than three hours before
Heller's executed in front of the country.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.040
Maybe we shouldn't concentrate on Bauer,
pursue other leads.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.920
Except for Heller's son,
we have no other leads.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.560
I want all tactical teams
working on finding Bauer and the hostile.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.120
You got it.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.840
Keep moving back towards the corner. Move!

03:27.920 --> 03:31.200
- Everybody get down. Lady, get down.
- " Take it easy.

03:31.280 --> 03:36.520
Shut up. You wanna get through this,
you listen to me. Get down on the floor now.

03:36.600 --> 03:40.520
I want your wallets and your cellphones.
Make it quick.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.560
- Where's yours?
- I don't have one.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.320
Where's your cellphone?

03:56.080 --> 03:58.720
- What's this? You some kind of cop?
- No.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.640
- What do you need this for?
- Protection.

04:02.720 --> 04:07.960
I get my money, no one gets hurt.
Do I make myself clear?

04:08.040 --> 04:10.320
- You, in the cap, what's your name?
- Doug.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.640
Doug, give me your keys.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.360
Which one of these opens the front door?
Which one?

04:17.440 --> 04:19.760
The brass one.

04:34.080 --> 04:38.360
- There's an electrical problem. We're closed.
- I just need a pack of cigarettes.

04:38.440 --> 04:44.760
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to go to
the gas station across the street. Thank you.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.400
Is the satellite up yet?

05:07.480 --> 05:10.840
No, I have to reposition
without Driscoll noticing. Where are you?

05:10.920 --> 05:14.920
- I'm in a Mercury Mart. I staged a robbery.
- What?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.440
It was the only way to stop him
getting back on the road. How long?

05:18.520 --> 05:21.960
- It's gonna take ten minutes.
- Son of a bitch. Please hurry.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.600
- I'll get back to you.
- Chloe, Driscoll's called a briefing.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.680
- I'll be there in a couple minutes.
- Chloe. Now.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.120
- Where are you going?
- To a briefing.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.600
- Should I be in that?
- No.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.280
- Hi, I'm Marianne. I'm helping out today.
- OK.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.760
And you are?

05:51.840 --> 05:54.240
This is Chloe O'Brian, our senior sys tech.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.560
She doesn't have time to chat either,
Marianne.

05:57.640 --> 06:00.000
It's nice to meet you, Chloe.

06:00.320 --> 06:04.960
As some of you know, about an hour ago
a hostile abducted a witness, Andrew Paige.

06:05.040 --> 06:09.400
- Do we know where this hostile is?
- No, but we have a general direction of travel.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.880
County Emergency Services called this in.
His best route of escape is the freeway.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.760
He'll likely dump his vehicle
and try to hijack another one.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.600
This is Andrew Paige.

06:22.240 --> 06:27.760
He was apparently tortured and about to be
killed when it seems Jack Bauer intervened.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.280
If this took place in the last half-hour,

06:30.360 --> 06:35.240
and the hostile continued east, he's
somewhere in northeast Ventura County.

06:35.320 --> 06:39.440
We'll coordinate with Caltrans
and Ventura sheriffs to set up watch points.

06:39.520 --> 06:43.400
I want every resource on this.
Edgar, lead satellite positioning.

06:43.480 --> 06:47.640
Sarah, you'll coordinate with NSA.
That's all. Thank you.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.240
Chloe.

06:52.320 --> 06:57.160
I'm sorry about Andrew. They said
there's a good chance that he'll pull through.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.400
Thanks.

06:59.480 --> 07:03.520
And, Chloe,
there's nothing you could have done.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.440
- I want you to put a pipe into Chloe's system.
- What for?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.760
- She knew about Paige.
- How do you know?

07:15.840 --> 07:20.480
Her reactions. Which means
she's been in touch with Jack Bauer.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.280
Well, I'll need her access code.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.160
Doug, get over here now!

07:40.520 --> 07:42.600
Open the safe.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.480
- That's it?
- Yeah. Why don't you take it and leave?

07:57.560 --> 08:01.280
I-I won't tell the police.
- When does the armoured truck come?

08:01.360 --> 08:04.440
About 12:30. What, you want
to rob the armoured truck too?

08:04.520 --> 08:07.440
Shut up. Get back in the corner. Move!

08:13.280 --> 08:16.240
He's gonna keep us here another two hours?

08:20.040 --> 08:22.880
We have to do something to stop him.

08:27.640 --> 08:31.280
Dammit. Something is wrong.
Kalil is not answering his phone.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.280
- Maybe he's out of range.
- No, not for this long.

08:34.360 --> 08:39.640
Check with our people in the area.
Find out if anything has happened to him.

08:42.039 --> 08:46.040
Kalil may not be here in time.
We'll have to boot up the routers without him.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.960
Take care of it.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.760
Let my daughter go. You don't need her.

08:54.480 --> 08:59.440
- She has already been useful.
- Please. I'll do whatever you want.

08:59.520 --> 09:02.720
I know you will.
That's why we are keeping her.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.320
I don't care if you kill me,
but if you kill her,

09:06.400 --> 09:10.560
even your own people
will see you as a barbaric pig.

09:13.800 --> 09:19.200
- Is this what your religion teaches you?
- Dad, Dad, calm down.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.160
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

09:24.600 --> 09:29.360
Where's your medication?
Your nitroglycerine, where is it?

09:29.440 --> 09:32.080
I left it in the car.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.080
My father has a heart condition.
He needs his medication.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.200
- Has Chloe been in contact with Bauer?
- No.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.400
Keep watching.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.440
- This is Edgar Stiles.
- Edgar, it's Chloe.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.160
- Why you calling me?
- I need to talk to you. Meet me at Archives.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.400
- When?
- Now.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.560
- Why are we meeting like this?
- I need you to help me.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.640
With what?

10:54.720 --> 10:57.160
- I think Sarah piped into my system.
- Why?

10:57.240 --> 10:59.600
Driscoll must have asked her to.

10:59.680 --> 11:03.960
If Driscoll's spying on you, she must have
a reason. I'm not getting involved.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.680
- I've been in contact with Jack Bauer.
- What?

11:06.760 --> 11:10.200
- That's right. So either help me or turn me in.
- I'm turning you in.

11:10.280 --> 11:14.400
- Jack can find Heller. Driscoll won't let him.
- That's her call.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.480
- She's wrong.
- That's your opinion.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.760
These decisions are not ours to make.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.720
How about if you do it as a favour to me?

11:22.800 --> 11:27.120
How many times have I helped you
since you started here? A lot.

11:27.200 --> 11:31.400
What about the first two weeks when I did
all your work because you were nervous?

11:31.480 --> 11:33.440
You owe me.

11:33.520 --> 11:37.800
- This could get me fired.
- Not if I say I ordered you to do it.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.280
Remember, I outrank you. I'd take the heat.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.760
What do I have to do?

11:44.840 --> 11:47.880
I need to reposition a satellite
and I need to do it now.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.200
Since Sarah's piping my system
we have to use yours.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.400
OK.

11:52.480 --> 11:57.480
Send it to Archives Three.
I've transferred my calls there.

12:16.520 --> 12:21.320
I want to know who's in charge here. I want
to speak to the man who was just in here.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.360
- You'll speak to him later.
- No, now.

12:24.440 --> 12:30.000
I am the Secretary of Defense of the United
States of America. You will listen to me.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.440
- Dad, don't make it worse.
- What do you mean?

12:32.520 --> 12:38.160
What can be worse than waiting here to be
murdered by these lawless, godless thugs?

12:38.240 --> 12:42.880
- Dad, calm down.
- I don't want to. Don't tell me to calm down.

12:42.960 --> 12:46.520
We're here, OK? The best we can do
is hope that someone comes and...

12:46.600 --> 12:50.600
Hope? Hope that we get rescued? We have
to do something. We have to take...

12:50.680 --> 12:52.920
Argh! Argh!

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Dad, what is it? What's happening?
Dad, just... OK, take a deep breath.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.320
Help me. I think he's having a heart attack.

12:59.400 --> 13:04.040
Dad, you've gotta lie down. Just lie down.
Dad, are you listening? It's OK. He's coming.

13:04.120 --> 13:07.840
- Step back. Step away from him.
- We need to lie him down, please.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.200
- Hurry, you've got to get him...
- Step away.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.400
Go on. Get out of here.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.760
- You still with me?
- Yeah.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.000
Let's go.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.160
Go back! Go back!

14:10.040 --> 14:12.360
Put your weapon down. Slowly.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.440
Both of you, hands on your head.

14:24.640 --> 14:29.720
If another one of my men dies,
your daughter will be killed.

14:40.600 --> 14:45.000
- How many men come with the truck?
- Two. One by the door. One takes the money.

14:45.080 --> 14:50.120
- They park in the front or the back?
- In the front, by the street.

14:50.200 --> 14:54.800
Come on, let's go. Everybody up,
we're moving to the back of the store. Now!

14:54.880 --> 14:57.000
- Stand there.
- The longer you keep us...

14:57.080 --> 14:59.240
Shut up. Let's go.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.840
You try that again and I will kill you.
You understand me?

15:07.920 --> 15:10.760
Get up. Now!

15:11.480 --> 15:14.280
Move to the back of the store.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.960
Dammit. Everybody in the freezer. Now.
Not you.

15:25.040 --> 15:29.400
Move. Anybody makes a sound,
I kill all of you.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.480
- " Doug, you in there?
- Make him go away.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.480
Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the back.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.400
- How come you're closed?
- I'm taking inventory.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.720
In the middle of the day?

16:04.600 --> 16:06.680
Yeah.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.040
OK, then.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.800
- You're sure everything's all right?
- Yeah, fine.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.920
- You don't look fine, Doug.
- I'm just a little tired.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.160
- Thanks.
- You mind if I use the head?

16:18.240 --> 16:20.760
It's broken.

16:20.840 --> 16:25.200
" Something's wrong. Are you gonna
tell me, or do I have to see for myself?

16:25.280 --> 16:28.000
Don't even think about it. Step inside now.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.520
Move. Grab the counter.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.120
Doug, lock the door.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.520
Give me your keys.

16:36.600 --> 16:40.120
Go over there
and get me his gun and his radio.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.280
Move. Come on.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.480
Take out his cuffs.

16:51.560 --> 16:55.880
Officer, put your hands behind your back.
Cuff him.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.120
Go back to the freezer. Let's go.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.480
At this time we have no more information

17:34.560 --> 17:37.800
regarding the kidnapping
of Secretary of Defense Heller

17:37.880 --> 17:42.000
and his daughter, Audrey,
other than the image you are now seeing...

17:42.080 --> 17:45.800
My husband and I realise
we've been unfair to you.

17:45.880 --> 17:52.120
We've treated you as badly as we have been
treated ourselves by certain ignorant people.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.960
Well...

17:54.040 --> 17:58.760
it was pretty obvious
you didn't approve of us going out.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.840
- Is that OK to say?
- Yeah, it's OK.

18:03.760 --> 18:09.880
- Well, we hope you'll accept our apology.
- That means a lot to me.

18:09.960 --> 18:13.400
That said, there is something else
I want to discuss with you.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.000
What's that?

18:16.080 --> 18:20.280
This morning you followed Behrooz
to his father's warehouse.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.680
Oh.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.920
Um...

18:25.000 --> 18:27.880
I thought Behrooz was seeing someone else.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.240
- I got jealous.
- Oh, I understand,

18:31.320 --> 18:36.920
but Mr Araz moved his inventory there
because he's been robbed a few times

18:37.720 --> 18:42.240
and we've been trying to keep
that place secret so it doesn't happen again.

18:42.320 --> 18:47.760
- I promise I won't tell anyone where it is.
- Good. And you haven't told anyone yet?

18:47.840 --> 18:51.680
No. I haven't talked to anyone
but Behrooz today.

18:51.760 --> 18:54.240
Well, then, that's settled.

18:54.320 --> 18:58.920
- Thank you for inviting me here, Mrs Araz.
- It's my pleasure.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.280
Has Behrooz ever shown you pictures
from when he was a child?

19:02.360 --> 19:04.160
No.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.320
Show her, Behrooz. Have a look at these.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.640
I'll be right back.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.480
Oh, my God.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.480
- That's not you.
- Hm. It is.

19:25.560 --> 19:29.080
- You were so cute.
- Hm.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.720
- Thank you, Hana.
- You're welcome.

19:40.800 --> 19:45.680
- Have you been following this, Mr Araz?
- " Secretary of Defense James Heller..."

19:45.760 --> 19:47.160
Yes. It's horrible.

19:47.240 --> 19:51.400
It makes it so difficult when people
from home do these unspeakable things.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.400
I agree.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.800
- Yes.
- The girl didn't tell anyone.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.520
- "Are you sure?"
- Yes.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.680
- Good. It'll be taken care of, then?
- Soon.

20:08.560 --> 20:12.600
Have Behrooz do it. He created this problem,
he should solve it himself.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.960
- I agree. I'll call you when it's done.
- Thank you.

20:18.400 --> 20:24.560
Two Charles Nine, there's a 211 in
progress at 2221 Mill Road, cross street Cedar.

20:24.640 --> 20:29.840
Two males seen leaving the bank
with shotguns. Respond code three.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.360
Two Charles Nine, do you copy?

20:34.400 --> 20:37.040
Stand back from the door!

20:38.560 --> 20:40.680
- Step back.
- " Do you copy?"

20:40.760 --> 20:44.800
- You. Are you unit nine?
- Yeah.

20:44.880 --> 20:50.520
You tell them you're on your way.
One wrong word and I will kill you. Now.

20:52.360 --> 20:56.480
- Two Charles Nine...
- Help! We're being robbed!

20:56.560 --> 21:00.040
- " We have help on the way."
- Get up. Now!

21:00.120 --> 21:03.520
- Now would be the time to let us go.
- Shut up.

21:06.880 --> 21:11.920
These people are your responsibility.
You better start talking to them.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.400
Sarah.

21:35.480 --> 21:38.280
- Has Chloe had any contact with Bauer yet?
- No.

21:38.360 --> 21:42.280
- Could her work be on his behalf?
- No. I've been watching her system.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.600
Chloe is not stupid.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.760
Assume she's taken measures
to protect herself.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.680
Maybe she's coopted the help
of someone else inside.

21:50.760 --> 21:54.400
I'm not quite sure how much of my time
you want me to devote to this.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.800
I expect you to be able to walk
and chew gum at the same time.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.320
Chloe's loyal to Bauer.
There's a good chance she's helping him.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.720
Find out how.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.480
What are you doing?
That looks like a satellite.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.360
- It was. I mean it is.
- A satellite for what?

22:17.440 --> 22:20.160
- We're trying to find Bauer.
- Division's doing that.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.960
I'm just going over it.
Sometimes they miss data.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.680
- Do they know that you're doing that?
- Yeah, they know what I'm doing.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.840
Here, call them if you don't believe me.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.920
Relax. I don't have to call anybody.
Do what you have to do.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.120
I will.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.760
Do me a favour. There's a chance
that Jack might try to contact Chloe.

22:44.840 --> 22:49.800
- If you see or hear anything, call me, OK?
- Why would Jack try to contact Chloe?

22:49.880 --> 22:52.600
- He just might. Let me know.
- Sure.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.640
- Edgar Stiles.
- " Edgar, what did she want?"

23:08.720 --> 23:11.080
She wants to nail you to the wall.

23:11.160 --> 23:14.600
Remember our deal. If you get caught,
you don't take me with you.

23:14.680 --> 23:17.600
And if I get caught,
you say you ordered me to do this.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.920
You don't have to repeat the deal.
Did you reposition the satellite?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
I'm working on it. Leave me alone.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.720
No. We'll use our own people for that.

23:32.800 --> 23:37.040
- Hang on, Ed. Yes, what is it?
- " Your daughter's on line two."

23:37.120 --> 23:42.160
- I'm busy. Tell her I'll call her back.
- " She says it's important."

23:42.240 --> 23:46.440
Fine. Ed, I'm gonna
have to get back to you. OK, bye.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.520
- Maya?
- I need you to come home.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.240
- " What's wrong?"
- I'm having a bad day.

23:53.320 --> 23:57.320
- Have you been taking your medication?
- No.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.920
If you don't take it you're going to feel bad.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.840
It numbs me. I don't like it.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.800
- Do you like feeling like this better?
- Come home.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.080
- I can't, Maya.
- Why not?

24:08.160 --> 24:12.040
Listen. I want you to take the pills
and I'll call you back as soon as I can.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.960
- You promise?
- Of course. What are you gonna do?

24:16.040 --> 24:19.480
- I'll take my pills.
- Good.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.480
- Do you love me?
- You know I do.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.880
Then why don't you say it?

24:23.960 --> 24:26.320
I love you, Maya, OK?

24:26.400 --> 24:28.720
- I do.
- OK.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.120
All right. Bye.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.960
Behrooz, can I see you for a moment?

24:40.400 --> 24:41.960
Yes.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.200
I'll be right back.

24:56.560 --> 25:02.560
I talked to your father. We both agree you
have to be the one who'll take care of this.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.880
- She didn't tell anyone.
- We're fortunate that's the case,

25:08.960 --> 25:11.120
but she still saw the warehouse,

25:11.200 --> 25:17.520
and she could tell the authorities about it
if she's ever brought in for questioning.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.280
This is riskier than letting her live. If she
disappears, her mother will call the police.

25:23.360 --> 25:28.640
By the time this day is over, the police
will be too busy to look for a runaway girl.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.320
Now, take it.

25:32.240 --> 25:38.240
Don't make me bring your father into this.
Just take her to the basement and do it.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.440
Don't think about it.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.840
Get it over with.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.080
- Behrooz?
- Hey.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.600
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

26:25.680 --> 26:29.400
I want to make a copy of this one.
Can I take it home and scan it?

26:29.480 --> 26:31.280
Sure.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.880
- We need to get out of here. You're in danger.
- From who?

26:42.960 --> 26:47.240
- Don't ask questions, just come with me.
- What? Behrooz?

26:47.320 --> 26:49.400
Trust me, Debbie.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.520
- We're OK. Come on.
- I can't.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.640
- Why not? What's wrong?
- I don't know. "

26:59.720 --> 27:04.400
Answer me, Debbie. What's wrong?
Come on, Debbie. What's wrong?

27:04.480 --> 27:08.240
- Get up, Debbie. We need to go. Come on.
- " Please help me.

27:08.320 --> 27:12.240
What's wrong? Debbie, come on.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.480
Debbie, what's wrong?

27:17.720 --> 27:23.280
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't expect you to be able to do it.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.880
Debbie. Debbie.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.880
Come on, Debbie. Debbie!

27:41.840 --> 27:44.320
Give me the gun.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.320
Give me the gun.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.440
Hey!

28:06.280 --> 28:09.560
I am so disappointed in you.

28:51.880 --> 28:52.920
Yeah?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.760
This is Sergeant McGrath. You're surrounded.

28:55.840 --> 28:58.200
You should know that I've got hostages.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.360
I will kill them if you use tear gas
and send your men in.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.520
Let's not go there yet, OK?
Who do you have in there?

29:04.600 --> 29:07.280
The owner, two men and a woman.

29:07.360 --> 29:10.040
- What about Officer Dotson?
- Yeah, I got him too.

29:10.120 --> 29:14.040
You only need one hostage.
Keep Officer Dotson and let the others go.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.680
I need to think about that.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.680
" Yeah?"

29:39.760 --> 29:42.240
- I've got satellite coverage.
- OK, good.

29:42.320 --> 29:46.160
The suspect will be free in five minutes.
He'll be on foot on Route 11.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.960
I'll find him.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.680
One of you is coming with me.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.160
You.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.960
Come here.

30:21.040 --> 30:24.400
Put your hands up against the rack. Now!

30:25.720 --> 30:30.040
Everybody else,
to the back of the cooler. Move!

30:31.920 --> 30:33.840
Open the door.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.880
Lock the door with the chain.

30:45.960 --> 30:49.080
Now, I will let you go as soon as we are clear.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.840
If you try and be a hero, I'll kill you.
Understand?

30:51.920 --> 30:55.760
- I understand.
- Good. Let's go.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.920
- Which car is yours?
- The blue Lexus.

31:02.880 --> 31:05.600
Unlock the door.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.000
Move.

31:08.080 --> 31:11.560
Tell those officers
to put their weapons down and step back.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.800
OK. We'll try and help you through this.

31:13.880 --> 31:18.840
- Tell them to do it now!
- OK, drop your weapons and move back.

31:25.520 --> 31:30.280
- " Stand back!
- " Do it. Step back."

31:30.720 --> 31:33.520
Get into the car.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.840
Open the door.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.440
Come on, open the driver's door.

31:39.880 --> 31:43.280
If you try and follow me, I will shoot him.

31:44.480 --> 31:48.320
On my count, get in.
One, two, three. Move.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.240
Go! Go!

32:00.120 --> 32:05.080
Call in a roadblock. Suspect driving
east on Route 11. One hostage.

32:17.560 --> 32:22.240
Move the rear-view mirror to the right
so I can see out the back.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.240
There.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.800
- When do you let me go?
- When I feel like it.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.600
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?

32:35.680 --> 32:38.280
You don't seem like
you need to rob a Mercury Mart.

32:38.360 --> 32:43.520
That Mercury Mart was a money drop. There
was supposed to be 18 grand in that safe.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.760
How did you know that?

32:46.840 --> 32:50.480
We're done sharing. I'll not forget
your face and I've got your licence.

32:50.560 --> 32:55.640
You talk to the police, it's not gonna be
hard to find you. Do you understand me?

32:55.720 --> 32:58.720
I won't tell them a thing.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.320
OK, pull over here.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.040
Now!

33:09.000 --> 33:12.960
Get out of the car. Move!

33:14.360 --> 33:16.960
Start running. Now!

33:38.080 --> 33:40.720
O'Brian.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.480
- "You got him?"
- Yeah.

33:42.560 --> 33:45.160
Download his position to my PDA.
Stay reachable.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.800
I will.

34:12.280 --> 34:15.639
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
Hold on a second.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.760
- Ms Driscoll.
- Yes, Sarah?

34:17.840 --> 34:23.120
You have a phone call from your neighbour.
A George Kliavkoff. It's about your daughter.

34:23.199 --> 34:25.159
- What line?
- Six.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.239
It's Erin.

34:28.320 --> 34:32.000
- There's been another incident with Maya.
- What's happened?

34:32.080 --> 34:35.760
She came into the back yard
and started screaming at Evan again.

34:35.840 --> 34:39.320
- Is Evan OK?
- Yes. Fortunately I was home.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.760
But this is the end. I've got to protect my boy.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.840
- Did you call the police?
- Yes. They're on their way.

34:46.920 --> 34:50.000
- Where's Maya now?
- "She went back to your house."

34:50.080 --> 34:54.639
- I'm very sorry. This will not happen again.
- It can't, Erin.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.800
Ms Driscoll? Is everything all right?

35:01.880 --> 35:04.160
No, it's not.

35:04.240 --> 35:07.640
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- Yes.

35:13.480 --> 35:17.560
Call LAPD Westside and find out
who they dispatched to pick up my daughter.

35:17.640 --> 35:20.800
She has a condition.
She suffers from schizophrenia.

35:20.880 --> 35:24.600
There was an incident
with one of my neighbours.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.680
What would you like me to do?

35:27.760 --> 35:30.840
Tell the officers to cancel the call.
I'll take care of it.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.480
Yeah, I don't think that's possible.
They have to follow through.

35:34.560 --> 35:39.160
- CTU has pre-emptive privilege over local.
- Only in a national security situation.

35:39.240 --> 35:43.000
Sarah, I'm asking you to do something.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.600
Should I ask someone else?

35:45.680 --> 35:47.520
No.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.920
I'll do it.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.280
Send a unit over to my house.
One medic, one field agent.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.760
- Bring Maya back to our clinic.
- Yes, ma'am.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.840
Thank you.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.120
Yeah, I got it. Thanks.

36:06.320 --> 36:08.640
I found Jack Bauer.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.840
- Where is he?
- Somis. He's tracking the hostile.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.520
- Now he's using satellite.
- How do you know that?

36:15.600 --> 36:18.480
DOD complained that someone
was stealing bandwidth.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.720
I took a look at the imagery and found him.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.360
All right. Bring them both in.
Who logged on to that satellite?

36:24.440 --> 36:25.560
Chloe.

36:25.640 --> 36:30.520
Chloe, why are you logged on
to an active DOD satellite?

36:32.160 --> 36:35.840
- All right, you're done here.
- Whatever. I was gonna quit anyway.

36:35.920 --> 36:39.120
You're not fired, you're arrested. Call security.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.720
Edgar, lock up her systems
and take control of all her files.

36:42.800 --> 36:46.120
- Yes, ma'am.
- I want you to call Jack Bauer now.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.480
- Yeah?
- "Driscoll wants to talk."

36:59.560 --> 37:01.560
- What?
- Hello, Jack.

37:01.640 --> 37:06.160
Erin. Look, I've got some information for you.
The hostile's name is Kalil Hasan.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.360
Stand down. It's over.

37:08.440 --> 37:11.400
Erin, Hasan is free.
He's looking for a car and a phone.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.040
Once he has those things
he'll lead us straight to Heller.

37:15.120 --> 37:18.160
- You can't be sure.
- You've got him on satellite.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.440
Bombard the area with a receptor beacon.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.760
Send a team to pick up the hostile.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.920
If you do that,
everything I've done will mean nothing.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.880
- I'm glad you finally figured that out.
- Erin.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.880
- Take Ms O'Brian into holding.
- Ma'am.

37:36.600 --> 37:39.400
Edgar, you have it up on satellite?

37:39.480 --> 37:41.080
Yeah.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.840
The hostile's flagging down a car.

37:47.480 --> 37:50.640
- " Need some help?
- Yeah, I just, uh...

38:17.400 --> 38:19.960
Curtis, give me the feed down here.

38:20.040 --> 38:24.160
- Sarah, what's the load on the cell tower?
- About 40 to 50 calls.

38:24.240 --> 38:29.280
Put personnel on every call.
Let's see if he contacts someone.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.080
- "Yes?"
- Omar, it's me.

38:38.160 --> 38:42.640
- Where have you been? We've been worried.
- Everything's fine. I'll explain later.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.200
- "Where are you?"
- I'll be there within the hour.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.840
- Is the broadcast on schedule?
- Yes.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.400
We're about to prepare Heller. Hurry.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.320
- Edgar.
- Not now.

38:56.400 --> 39:01.200
Yes, now. How do you feel
about what's happening to Chloe?

39:02.920 --> 39:05.600
- What do you mean?
- She'll notjust lose her job.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.960
- She might go to prison.
- Why do you care about all this?

39:09.040 --> 39:13.840
I overheard the conversation you had earlier.
I know you were working with her.

39:13.920 --> 39:18.920
- What do you want?
- I want your attention whenever I need it.

39:21.200 --> 39:24.680
Thanks, Robin. Ms Driscoll, we got the call.

39:25.560 --> 39:28.160
" Put it on speaker.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.040
Cue it from the top of the call.

39:32.480 --> 39:33.480
Omar, it's me.

39:33.560 --> 39:38.040
- "Where have you been? We've been worried."
- "Everything's fine. I'll explain later."

39:38.120 --> 39:40.880
- "Where are you?"
- "I'll be there within the hour."

39:40.960 --> 39:43.160
- "Is the broadcast on schedule?"
- "Yes."

39:43.240 --> 39:46.560
We're about to prepare Heller. Hurry.

39:46.640 --> 39:49.800
" Looks like Jack was right.

39:51.120 --> 39:56.960
Tell the teams to stand down for the time
being. We'll keep tracking Hasan by satellite.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.680
Son of a bitch.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.640
- Dammit.
- Get out of the car.

40:50.720 --> 40:54.520
Get out of the car
and put your hands in the air.

41:00.600 --> 41:05.040
- " Step out of the vehicle now.
- " Come on. Come on.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.040
- Get out of the car now.
- " Get your hands up

41:08.120 --> 41:10.200
and step out of the vehicle.

41:14.640 --> 41:18.360
- " Suspect is armed."
- " Step away from the car.

41:18.440 --> 41:21.280
" Down! On your knees.

41:21.360 --> 41:26.720
" Put your palms down.
Put your chest flat on the ground.

41:27.600 --> 41:31.520
Keep your hands down, all the way down.
