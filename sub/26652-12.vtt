Previously on
<i>"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:01.971 --> 00:03.278
You and I dating would be
totally weird.

00:03.279 --> 00:04.272
Totally weird.

00:04.278 --> 00:06.298
Hank is running
some secret project.

00:06.310 --> 00:08.810
A man came to me, Neron.
He offered me a deal.

00:08.890 --> 00:11.060
Don't tell me you're having
second thoughts.

00:11.070 --> 00:12.440
I have a new partner now.
My son.

00:12.520 --> 00:15.490
- I don't need you anymore.
- I don't need you anymore, either.

00:15.570 --> 00:17.990
- Dad?
- I'm sorry.

00:19.190 --> 00:20.700
I didn't kill Nate's dad.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.870
Sara, you're asking me
to risk everything

00:22.940 --> 00:25.200
for some conspiracy theory?
For a bunch of monsters?

00:25.280 --> 00:27.000
- Ava, don't do this.
- I'm done.

00:27.010 --> 00:29.000
<i>Ava and I didn't just
get into an argument.</i>

00:29.070 --> 00:30.840
<i>She asked me to leave.</i>

00:36.120 --> 00:38.550
Come on, Ava, open up.

00:41.210 --> 00:45.260
Look, I... I miss you.

00:45.270 --> 00:47.850
And I'm sorry things went down
the way they did,

00:47.930 --> 00:50.520
but please just open the door.

00:52.360 --> 00:54.690
<i>Well, technically
this is still our apartment.</i>

01:14.110 --> 01:15.590
So I was saying...

01:15.660 --> 01:18.010
Nora, what are you doing here?

01:18.090 --> 01:20.800
- Uh, I can explain.
- I can explain.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.630
I didn't kill Hank,
it was a demon.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.810
Yeah, I know.
His name is Neron

01:24.890 --> 01:26.930
and he's wearing Desmond
as a bleeding suit.

01:27.010 --> 01:29.150
- Ray!
- Sara! Great news.

01:29.230 --> 01:30.810
Hank was killed by a demon.

01:30.820 --> 01:32.270
"Great" was not the word
he was looking for.

01:32.350 --> 01:34.820
- Poor Nate.
- Look, Ava is missing.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.400
- Missing?
- I... I should have

01:36.410 --> 01:37.900
checked on her sooner.
It's Neron.

01:37.910 --> 01:39.400
He has his sights set
on the Time Bureau

01:39.480 --> 01:40.910
and the creatures,
and if he got to Hank,

01:40.990 --> 01:43.500
then dingdongs to donuts,
Ava was next.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.950
- Hey, she is not dead.
- Listen, when Neron

01:46.030 --> 01:48.840
was out the Bureau,
he and I shared a connection.

01:48.910 --> 01:50.410
If you can take me
to Ava's place,

01:50.490 --> 01:51.580
I might be able to know
where he took her.

01:51.660 --> 01:53.120
Demons communicate,

01:53.200 --> 01:54.210
he'll know your past,
how susceptible you are.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.420
You're a liability.

01:56.490 --> 01:59.300
She's not a liability.
She's a survivor.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.010
Unlike you, she's turned her
dark experiences

02:01.020 --> 02:02.520
into a source of strength,

02:02.590 --> 02:05.600
not an excuse for alcoholism
or chain smoking.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.100
She also saved your life.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.310
Sorry.
Would you like to add anything?

02:08.380 --> 02:09.810
No, that about covers it.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.350
I don't care
if she's a liability.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.140
If Neron has Ava, then I need

02:14.220 --> 02:16.440
all the magical firepower
that we've got.

02:16.510 --> 02:19.150
You two with me.
Woman the ship.

02:24.450 --> 02:26.490
This is from two weeks ago.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.280
Oh...

02:28.360 --> 02:32.160
She's been gone a tick.
That's not good.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.330
Yeah, thanks.

02:41.060 --> 02:44.970
- There.
- What? What do you see?

02:45.040 --> 02:48.560
He had her.
Here.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.980
- Ava...
- That doesn't mean she's dead.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.980
It doesn't mean she's alive,
either.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.160
I know where she is.

03:15.990 --> 03:19.380
Conspiracies, embezzling,
paper trails...

03:19.450 --> 03:21.380
I feel like Julia Roberts
in "Erin Brockovich."

03:21.450 --> 03:23.670
We're more Pacific Gas
and Electric, Gary.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.930
- Wait, we're the bad guys?
- I don't know who we are,

03:26.010 --> 03:27.590
Gary, all right?
We're the guys trying to keep

03:27.600 --> 03:31.050
my dad's cracked out idea of
Jur-magic Park

03:31.130 --> 03:32.890
from tanking the Time Bureau.
All right?

03:32.970 --> 03:36.440
So anything that has to do with
Heyworld, get rid of it!

03:36.520 --> 03:38.440
How am I gonna explain
all this to Director Sharpe?

03:38.450 --> 03:40.560
Actually, Ava's missing.

03:40.640 --> 03:44.690
I knew it. I knew it, you
know, I had a dream about her

03:44.770 --> 03:46.610
where she was driving and I was
in a car seat in the back.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.080
We were headed to Schul.
Gary.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.830
She needs me.

03:49.910 --> 03:51.630
I got... I got...

03:51.700 --> 03:54.960
Sara, Constantine, and Nora
are... looking for her.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.370
- Nora?
- Look, she didn't kill Hank.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.420
- Come on, man.
- Just listen, okay?

03:59.490 --> 04:03.380
Your dad made a deal
with a demon named Neron.

04:03.460 --> 04:07.260
I guess something went wrong
and the demon killed him.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.760
I'm sorry, buddy.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.440
My dad made a deal with a demon

04:18.510 --> 04:21.600
to open a theme park?

04:21.620 --> 04:23.660
Oh, Ray,

04:23.730 --> 04:26.150
I don't know how much more
of this I can take, man.

04:29.980 --> 04:33.120
Is that you?
No.

04:37.660 --> 04:39.010
If this is my dad's mistress,

04:39.080 --> 04:42.180
I'm gonna jump out a window.

04:42.250 --> 04:45.050
Hello?
<i>Yo, Mr. H., it's Mikey T.</i>

04:45.060 --> 04:47.680
<i>Listen, got a question for you
about the dragon lair.</i>

04:47.760 --> 04:49.890
<i>Could sure use your eyes
down here.</i>

04:49.970 --> 04:51.970
Uh, do-down where?

04:52.050 --> 04:56.020
<i>- What? Here, at the site.</i>
- Uh, Buckwood Downs?

04:56.100 --> 04:58.680
<i>- Uh, yeah, where else?</i>
- Talk to you later.

04:58.690 --> 05:00.190
Who was it?

05:00.270 --> 05:02.060
I don't know,
he sounded like a Soprano,

05:02.140 --> 05:05.950
but apparently my dad started
building this theme park.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.860
The guys who were
working with him,

05:08.870 --> 05:10.700
maybe they know something
about this Neron

05:10.710 --> 05:12.870
a-and why he killed my dad.

05:12.950 --> 05:16.210
Come on!
I'm Steel, you're The Atom.

05:16.290 --> 05:18.200
There is nothing
we cannot handle!

05:27.220 --> 05:28.210
This one.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.130
Ava?

05:33.210 --> 05:34.560
Hey.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.890
Ava.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.400
She's alive.

05:40.930 --> 05:44.070
What did he do to her?
He's preparing her.

05:44.150 --> 05:46.310
Neron must be looking
for a new vessel.

05:46.390 --> 05:48.030
It only makes sense
going after Ava,

05:48.110 --> 05:50.190
especially if he wants control
over the Time Bureau.

05:50.270 --> 05:51.860
But when a demon
possesses someone,

05:51.940 --> 05:54.030
the body has to be willing,
and if it's not,

05:54.110 --> 05:55.750
the demon has to force
his way in

05:55.830 --> 05:58.080
by sending the soul
to purgatory.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.090
That's where the
real fight begins.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.540
How do we save her?

06:01.610 --> 06:04.370
Some souls go up
and some go down.

06:04.450 --> 06:07.250
But if she's been there
as long as she has,

06:07.260 --> 06:09.670
then she's not
coming back, Sara.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.260
I'm not giving up on her, John.

06:11.340 --> 06:13.380
You're going to send me
to purgatory to get her.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.010
If I send you down there
with her,

06:15.090 --> 06:16.600
there's nothing that I can do
to protect you.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.180
- I'll take my chances.
- This isn't something

06:18.260 --> 06:19.890
you can just fight your way
through, love.

06:19.970 --> 06:22.610
John, please!

06:24.800 --> 06:26.450
Fine.

06:31.450 --> 06:33.860
Lay down.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.780
Our purgatory is designed

06:39.800 --> 06:41.950
to drive the soul
to breaking point.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.790
It's tailored to drive
the captive mad.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.710
Now where you're going,

06:46.780 --> 06:49.130
that's Ava's personal nightmare.

06:49.140 --> 06:52.300
I've died, lost my soul,
and escaped a demon realm.

06:52.310 --> 06:55.390
I'm pretty sure I can handle
Ava's purgatory.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.100
Well, prepare for the worst,
Sara Lance.

07:08.990 --> 07:11.520
Welcome.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.070
Do you need a bag?

07:30.290 --> 07:32.350
I gotta get out of here.

07:32.420 --> 07:33.510
I can't do this anymore.

07:33.590 --> 07:36.480
I just gotta get out of here.

07:36.550 --> 07:38.850
Ava!

07:38.930 --> 07:41.860
Hey. Hey.

07:41.930 --> 07:45.640
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my God.

07:45.650 --> 07:48.770
Sara, is that really you?
It's me. I got you.

07:48.850 --> 07:51.360
What the hell happened?
Am I dead?

07:51.440 --> 07:53.440
You were kidnapped by a demon

07:53.520 --> 07:55.320
and he's trying to take over
your body

07:55.400 --> 07:58.660
so he trapped your soul here in
your own personal purgatory.

07:58.730 --> 08:02.380
But Ava, if you check out,
you die.

08:02.450 --> 08:05.120
Well, that's kind of
on the nose, isn't it?

08:05.200 --> 08:06.660
Wait, does that mean
that he got you too?

08:06.740 --> 08:08.870
No.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.765
I'm taking you home.

08:16.300 --> 08:19.900
I got it!
Natari!

08:19.970 --> 08:22.270
I'm gonna regret asking this,
but what's that?

08:22.350 --> 08:25.280
It's your couple's name.
Nat for Nate

08:25.350 --> 08:27.360
and of course Ari is for you.

08:27.370 --> 08:28.860
You know I'm a superhero, right?

08:28.870 --> 08:30.820
With a flick of my wrist
I could blast you

08:30.830 --> 08:31.910
with my wind powers.

08:31.980 --> 08:33.370
Being honest, wind powers,

08:33.380 --> 08:34.490
just not that scary.

08:34.570 --> 08:35.870
Yeah,

08:35.880 --> 08:38.120
you're like
a magical hair dryer.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.370
What is this? "Legends Eye
for the Straight Guy"?

08:40.380 --> 08:43.250
- You're straight?
- Where's Sara?

08:43.260 --> 08:45.840
Uh, she's with Constantine
and Nora, trying to find Ava.

08:45.910 --> 08:48.090
<i>Actually, they've just
returned, and Mr. Constantine</i>

08:48.170 --> 08:49.510
<i>has called a team meeting
in the lab.</i>

08:49.580 --> 08:51.520
- He can do that?
- No.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.720
Let's go, dummies.

09:00.150 --> 09:03.110
- Ava's in hell?
- She's not in hell.

09:03.180 --> 09:06.020
Her soul is trapped in limbo.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.900
And I am right there with her.

09:07.910 --> 09:09.610
- Oh, Gary.
- Emotionally.

09:09.690 --> 09:11.250
Poor Director Sharpe.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.410
I've sent Sara down there
to try and pull her out.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.420
- I thought that they broke up.
- She still loves her.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.160
- What can we do?
- Sara chose to go in after her

09:19.240 --> 09:21.160
so unless praying is your thing,

09:21.240 --> 09:22.830
then the best thing
you can do is wait.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.340
You don't have to worry.

09:25.410 --> 09:27.460
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Uh...

09:27.470 --> 09:31.130
- Oh, he's all right.
- I'll take good care of her.

09:31.210 --> 09:32.880
Them.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.350
All right, Charlie,
you're with me

09:35.420 --> 09:37.310
- This should be interesting.
- Let's go find out what

09:37.380 --> 09:38.360
this demon wants, shall we?

09:38.430 --> 09:39.850
You up for it?
Mm.

09:39.930 --> 09:42.730
All right then,
let's raise some hell.

09:45.470 --> 09:50.070
Oh, how you doing?
Can I help you guys?

09:50.150 --> 09:54.960
Yeah, we're looking for Mr....
Uh, Mr. T.

09:55.030 --> 09:57.080
Who's asking?
'Cause no one's allowed

09:57.150 --> 09:59.370
on this site unle...

09:59.450 --> 10:02.710
Hey, I know you. I'd recognize
that Heywood jaw line anywhere.

10:02.780 --> 10:05.630
You must be "And Son."

10:05.640 --> 10:08.550
You kidding me? Hank is
always going on about you.

10:08.620 --> 10:11.420
Where... where is he?

10:11.500 --> 10:14.480
- Hank passed.
- What?

10:14.550 --> 10:16.720
Jeez, I... sorry to hear that.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.560
You mind if we
take a look around?

10:18.630 --> 10:20.970
Hey, it's all yours now, kid.

10:20.990 --> 10:23.650
Question: did my dad ever mention

10:23.730 --> 10:26.270
a man by the name of Neron?

10:26.350 --> 10:28.440
Neron? What is that, Greek?

10:28.520 --> 10:31.230
No, it's Demonic...
Danish, actually.

10:31.310 --> 10:33.490
No, never heard of the guy.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.330
A-actually,
to be honest with you,

10:35.410 --> 10:36.530
Hank didn't really tell me
a lot.

10:36.610 --> 10:39.000
All he gave me was... was this.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.870
We're building that right now.
A unicorn rodeo.

10:41.950 --> 10:44.290
Can you imagine?
Two unicorns jousting?

10:44.370 --> 10:46.790
I'd rather not.

10:46.870 --> 10:49.680
Hey, come here, come here.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.260
This. This is what I was
calling you guys about.

10:52.330 --> 10:54.680
About the, uh...
Dragon lair.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.930
Yeah, I know.
I drew it.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.970
I drew all of this.
Great, tell me something.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.470
Look at this. See this here?
What is this?

11:01.550 --> 11:02.770
Is this supposed
to be real flame,

11:02.840 --> 11:04.480
or were you thinking,
like, plexi?

11:04.550 --> 11:07.100
'Cause I got a guy that can
do fire. Like forget about it.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.790
I can't believe he did it.

11:22.860 --> 11:24.660
I know you and your dad
struggled

11:24.740 --> 11:26.160
and even if you got
your wires crossed,

11:26.240 --> 11:28.120
you never stopped
trying to connect.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.790
I just hope my dad
knew I loved him.

11:30.870 --> 11:34.380
Oh, he knew.
Look at this place.

11:34.390 --> 11:35.920
You know, I just wish
he would have found

11:36.000 --> 11:38.220
a better way to, you know,
tell me he loved me.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.510
One that didn't involve
teaming up with a demon

11:40.590 --> 11:42.060
and embezzling money
from the government.

11:42.070 --> 11:45.570
It's a bit much.

11:45.640 --> 11:49.150
Mikey T! Mikey T!

11:49.220 --> 11:51.910
Change of plans.

11:51.980 --> 11:54.190
Tear it down.

11:54.270 --> 11:57.820
The dragon lair?

11:57.900 --> 12:00.870
The whole thing.

12:02.490 --> 12:04.830
Waiting sucks.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.590
Ooh, sexting Nate?

12:07.670 --> 12:11.760
- Boundaries, Mona.
- I need vicarious feels.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.670
There are more important things

12:13.750 --> 12:16.550
to focus on right now
and Nate's got a lot going on.

12:16.630 --> 12:19.800
It's not the right time.
What are you typing?

12:19.880 --> 12:22.520
- Hey, what's up?
- Ugh...

12:22.600 --> 12:24.220
Okay, I don't even know
why I'm talking

12:24.230 --> 12:26.560
to you two about it.
You don't even date humans.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.320
Love's love.

12:33.430 --> 12:37.530
Whatever you need, I'm here.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.910
Whatever you need, I'm here.

12:42.980 --> 12:45.450
Why is Gary
in your subconscious?

12:45.460 --> 12:47.460
I may have some Gary issues
that need working out.

12:47.540 --> 12:50.460
Okay, we just... we need to find
the door that you came in.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.000
Does any of this look familiar?

12:52.010 --> 12:53.920
No, it all looks
exactly the same.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.210
Why don't we just try to
follow the arrows back?

12:56.290 --> 12:57.460
Maybe they'll take us
to the entrance.

12:57.470 --> 12:59.090
<i>Reminder, shoppers,</i>

12:59.100 --> 13:01.470
<i>the store will be closing
in one hour.</i>

13:01.480 --> 13:03.050
Constantine didn't say
anything about that.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.510
What does it mean?

13:04.590 --> 13:07.310
It means we take shortcuts.
Come on.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.610
- Hello, again, ladies.
- Damn it.

13:14.680 --> 13:16.940
Okay, this way.
No!

13:17.020 --> 13:20.280
Or we could just ask Gary.
How do we get to the entrance?

13:20.360 --> 13:22.410
Oh...

13:22.480 --> 13:25.080
We're not really allowed to
give that kind of advice.

13:25.150 --> 13:30.510
- Come on...
- But, the Ergrik wardrobe

13:30.580 --> 13:32.960
might be just the thing
you're looking for.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.930
Looks like the wardrobe section.

13:43.210 --> 13:44.800
Oh.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.970
Now what?

13:50.680 --> 13:53.480
I think we're supposed
to put it together.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.860
No sweat.

13:55.870 --> 13:58.190
Here.

13:58.200 --> 14:02.030
Wait, wait, wait. Step one,
insert the dowel.

14:02.040 --> 14:06.030
Here, babe.
I got this.

14:10.460 --> 14:13.160
Shut up, man!
What you gonna do about it?

14:27.640 --> 14:30.770
You kidding me?
Why, you brain-damaged?

14:33.260 --> 14:35.730
Papa's home.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.230
Miss me?

14:38.240 --> 14:39.520
I missed you.

14:42.650 --> 14:46.200
We'll be together soon, my pet.

14:46.270 --> 14:49.080
Not bloody likely.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.130
Oh, Nora.

14:58.370 --> 14:59.750
Ah!

15:28.210 --> 15:32.370
There's nowhere for you
to run now, you bile bladder.

15:32.380 --> 15:35.370
Me, run?
You're the one who ran.

15:35.380 --> 15:38.220
All I had to do was say,
"I'm coming for you, Johnny."

15:38.300 --> 15:41.560
And you left 2018 to me.

15:41.630 --> 15:45.230
It's delicious how easily
humans are corrupted,

15:45.300 --> 15:47.720
especially here in D.C.
So that's your game?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.850
You inflict fear and anger
on humanity?

15:49.920 --> 15:52.020
I merely fan the flames.

15:52.090 --> 15:54.560
People are primed to give in
to what they fear most.

15:54.570 --> 15:56.520
You know what, mate?
I am going to send your ass

15:56.600 --> 15:58.410
straight back to hell.

15:58.480 --> 16:02.070
- John, this isn't the plan.
- Nora, we finally get to talk.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.320
Hope you've enjoyed your little
dalliances inside my mind.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.080
<i>But it's not a one way street.
Is it, Nora?</i>

16:09.160 --> 16:10.830
- Ugh...
- I knew you were a liability.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.240
We should be off with him.

16:12.260 --> 16:13.920
You're playing right into
his hands, John.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.370
You're the one
who can't handle this.

16:15.450 --> 16:17.710
Oh, yes, says
Miss-Lock-Herself-Up

16:17.780 --> 16:19.500
because she can't handle
her own demons.

16:19.580 --> 16:22.920
Well, this is me
handling mine, all right?

16:25.630 --> 16:27.010
Out!

16:32.020 --> 16:33.600
- He's getting to you.
- Oh, he's getting to me?

16:33.610 --> 16:35.520
- Yeah.
- He's inside your head.

16:35.590 --> 16:38.400
What, you don't think
I haven't seen you struggling?

16:38.410 --> 16:41.320
Humanity hasn't exactly been
kind to you, has it, Nora?

16:41.330 --> 16:43.440
You're addicted
to this kind of power,

16:43.520 --> 16:45.450
and believe me,
it doesn't go away.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.240
No it doesn't and it hasn't
been easy, but if I can trust

16:48.320 --> 16:51.070
myself, I don't think it's too
much to ask for you to try too.

16:51.150 --> 16:54.160
Oh, it's killing you
to look at his face.

16:54.170 --> 16:55.460
I know how hard it is to watch

16:55.540 --> 16:57.120
someone you love become a demon.

16:57.130 --> 16:59.080
Yeah, well too bad there
aren't any Beebos around

16:59.160 --> 17:00.750
to hug it to death.

17:05.810 --> 17:10.300
We can't just keep him locked
up in there, driving us all mad.

17:10.310 --> 17:11.930
Yeah, well, I think
between the two of us,

17:12.010 --> 17:15.099
we can figure something out.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.990
Ta-dah!

17:22.329 --> 17:23.980
Damn it.
What a surprise.

17:23.990 --> 17:26.650
You followed none of the
instructions and it didn't work.

17:26.730 --> 17:28.950
I'm sensing that
this isn't about the dresser.

17:29.020 --> 17:30.780
No, this is what you always do.

17:30.860 --> 17:32.830
Just bulldoze your way though.
I do not always do this.

17:32.910 --> 17:34.530
Like lying to me
about the Kaupe?

17:34.610 --> 17:37.160
You were defending
torturing creatures.

17:37.170 --> 17:41.420
Defen... I wasn't defending it.
I was defending myself.

17:41.490 --> 17:42.840
Of course I don't believe
that we should

17:42.920 --> 17:44.680
be intentionally hurting
anything or anyone

17:44.760 --> 17:46.350
but when we fight, Sara,

17:46.420 --> 17:49.760
I get really scared,
and I just go to my corner.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.140
Look, it's just fight or flight.

17:54.210 --> 17:56.470
It couldn't be any more human.

17:56.550 --> 17:59.140
I just really need to know
that you're on my team.

18:02.220 --> 18:04.520
I am always on your team,

18:04.530 --> 18:06.730
even when we disagree.

18:08.900 --> 18:12.360
Now, should we
give it another go?

18:17.380 --> 18:19.050
Thank you.

18:25.630 --> 18:29.380
- Ah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

18:29.390 --> 18:32.510
See? Following instructions
is not that bad.

18:32.590 --> 18:34.050
Oh, don't gloat.

18:34.060 --> 18:35.390
Let's get out of here.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.520
Something's wrong.

18:39.590 --> 18:41.570
Did we miss a screw
or something?

18:41.650 --> 18:42.850
No...

18:42.930 --> 18:46.690
- We missed this.
- It's...

18:46.770 --> 18:49.400
How the hell did we possibly
miss this? Damn it.

18:49.410 --> 18:54.070
Hey, look.
It's not perfect, but it's ours.

18:54.150 --> 18:56.320
Can you live with that?

18:56.400 --> 18:57.990
Hey?

18:58.070 --> 18:59.490
Don't go in your corner.

19:03.430 --> 19:07.290
Yeah, I can live with it.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.170
Hell yeah.
Let's go to Narnia.

19:14.510 --> 19:15.940
Are we out?

19:16.010 --> 19:18.430
We're out of the closet
but not the store.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.770
Touché.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.440
Welcome to our mattress
showroom.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.890
If you'll follow me?

19:22.970 --> 19:25.060
The mattress you choose
will be the most

19:25.140 --> 19:27.110
important decision of your life.

19:27.190 --> 19:30.730
Wait, you're showing them
the mattresses?

19:30.810 --> 19:33.780
We need everyone out
before Tabitha gets here.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.030
Who the hell is Tabitha?

19:35.110 --> 19:36.960
You don't want to know Tabitha.

19:37.030 --> 19:38.450
Best of luck
in your mattress choice.

19:38.460 --> 19:41.450
- Wait, we need to...
- Gary, wait...

19:41.460 --> 19:43.290
This is starting to feel like
that escape room we did.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.920
Okay, so, subconscious Gary
said this would be the most

19:45.990 --> 19:48.080
important choice of our life.
What do you think that means?

19:48.160 --> 19:50.630
That even subconscious Gary
needs to get a life?

19:50.640 --> 19:52.630
No, it's a puzzle.
Do you... what does it mean?

19:52.710 --> 19:54.050
Do you think we need to...

19:54.130 --> 19:56.590
It means we need to pick
a mattress.

19:56.670 --> 19:59.810
How about this one?
What?

19:59.890 --> 20:01.770
Oh.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.230
Whoa, 600 bucks?
That is ridiculously...

20:04.240 --> 20:06.650
- Three-year warranty?
- Expensive, right?

20:06.730 --> 20:09.820
I was thinking, like, $250.

20:09.890 --> 20:10.990
Wha... Are you kidding?

20:11.070 --> 20:12.610
It would be saggy
in like a year.

20:12.690 --> 20:14.500
So you just flip it over.

20:14.570 --> 20:16.660
You just flip it over?
Is that what you do

20:16.740 --> 20:18.820
when things get saggy,
you just flip 'em over

20:18.830 --> 20:21.790
so you don't have to look
at their saggy faces?

20:21.870 --> 20:23.130
Okay.

20:31.180 --> 20:34.520
How about this one?
Fifteen years.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.340
Oh, that's better.

20:38.350 --> 20:40.770
Oh, when did you start
going grey?

20:40.850 --> 20:43.850
Whoa. This place has been
really stressful.

20:43.860 --> 20:46.350
Yeah.

20:46.430 --> 20:49.100
Ugh!

20:49.180 --> 20:51.820
I think it's the mattress.

20:51.890 --> 20:55.240
Apparently your purgatory
is your anxieties.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.820
One of which must be
getting old.

20:58.900 --> 21:02.280
I'm not worried
about getting old, Sara.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.800
I'm worried about
getting old with you.

21:14.090 --> 21:16.390
So we're...

21:16.470 --> 21:20.390
talking about marriage.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.480
Um...

21:27.090 --> 21:28.600
Wow.

21:28.680 --> 21:33.270
You look, um,
still really hot but...

21:33.350 --> 21:36.070
You too.

21:36.080 --> 21:39.080
Oh, well,
50 years is a long time

21:39.160 --> 21:42.660
sleeping on one mattress.

21:42.730 --> 21:44.250
It sure is.

21:44.330 --> 21:47.000
Look, I know it's a lot.

21:47.070 --> 21:50.090
50 years with just one person.

21:50.170 --> 21:52.330
Well, it's... it's not the one
person thing.

21:52.410 --> 21:55.100
I just...
Look, I've never really thought

21:55.170 --> 21:58.430
that much past tomorrow.

21:58.510 --> 22:01.100
Ava, with my past,

22:01.180 --> 22:03.720
planning anything
for the future is just...

22:03.800 --> 22:05.890
Feels like tempting fate.

22:05.970 --> 22:09.730
And I convinced myself
that I like it that way.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.440
Until you came along.

22:14.810 --> 22:17.110
You just freaking came
to purgatory for me.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.820
How's that for giving
the middle finger to fate?

22:19.900 --> 22:24.420
Look, you're allowed to want
things sometimes, Sara.

22:24.490 --> 22:30.120
But what if I can't be
the person that you need?

22:30.200 --> 22:32.920
Let's be honest,
neither of us needs anybody.

22:32.990 --> 22:34.420
Right?

22:34.430 --> 22:37.920
But you are who I want.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.390
I bet you there's some
good liquor in Ava's office.

22:47.470 --> 22:50.390
I mean, my dad's old office.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.560
Oh, man.
Things are bleak.

22:53.640 --> 22:57.860
Hey, Ray, thanks
for sticking around here.

22:57.870 --> 23:00.990
Yeah, buddy, of course.
That's what friends are for.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.910
I just wish I wasn't such
an idiot at my dad's funeral.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.490
I had a chance to talk to him,
but I blew it.

23:06.500 --> 23:10.000
Now I'll never know
what happened.

23:10.070 --> 23:12.010
Well, maybe Constantine
can get you some answers.

23:12.080 --> 23:14.870
Looks like they caught Neron.
Son of a bitch.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.510
Is that the demon
who killed my dad?

23:19.590 --> 23:20.760
Whoa, there, Squire.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.180
You take it easy, all right?

23:22.260 --> 23:23.340
Nate, you don't want to
go in there.

23:23.350 --> 23:24.800
Just walk away.
No.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.510
Not a chance.
Wait! Wait!

23:31.680 --> 23:33.350
Hello, Nathaniel.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.860
I've heard so much about you.

23:38.770 --> 23:42.980
So predictable. The son, who, in life,
could never connect with the father.

23:42.981 --> 23:44.820
Here now, seeking the truth.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.620
Well, here it is.

23:46.690 --> 23:51.380
Hank was an unfortunate snag
in my plans

23:51.460 --> 23:54.120
so I...

23:54.200 --> 23:58.090
- You evil bastard.
- Yeah. Demon.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.390
Nate's already angry,

24:02.470 --> 24:03.680
makes him prime pickings
for Neron.

24:03.750 --> 24:04.890
No, he'll be all right.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.050
As long as he doesn't cross

24:06.130 --> 24:08.810
that bloody barrier.
Ahh!

24:08.880 --> 24:11.850
Why? He built your theme park
just like you wanted.

24:11.860 --> 24:14.310
You think I wanted a theme park?

24:14.390 --> 24:16.060
I gave Hank power

24:16.070 --> 24:18.320
and in return,
he was to supply me

24:18.390 --> 24:20.740
with fear mongering
magical creatures

24:20.820 --> 24:24.240
to terrorize people
into giving up their souls.

24:24.250 --> 24:28.330
Instead, he went behind my back
and built some deranged zoo.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.700
He betrayed me

24:30.780 --> 24:32.580
because of you.
No.

24:32.660 --> 24:35.500
If you'd had just
stayed out of our way,

24:35.580 --> 24:39.590
maybe your old man
would still be alive.

24:39.660 --> 24:43.840
Nate, no wait!

24:48.210 --> 24:50.610
Ray, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, man.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.100
It's okay, buddy,
I know it wasn't you.

25:02.950 --> 25:04.860
Ohh.

25:09.940 --> 25:11.120
It's locked.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.460
Uhh, there's nothing to build.

25:16.470 --> 25:19.640
No furniture to choose.

25:19.710 --> 25:23.640
Dishes. Piece of cake.
Go, go, go.

25:23.720 --> 25:27.220
Yeah, this seems more like
one of your fantasies

25:27.290 --> 25:29.140
than your fears,
watching me do dishes.

25:29.150 --> 25:30.810
Please, if it were up to you,

25:30.890 --> 25:32.260
we would only have
paper plates. Here.

25:34.820 --> 25:35.930
You on that?

25:36.010 --> 25:37.780
- Got it.
- Hm.

25:42.810 --> 25:44.790
I'm on it.

25:54.700 --> 25:55.790
It never ends.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.170
- Did you send it?
- Honestly, mate,

25:59.180 --> 26:01.180
whatever happened to just
talking to someone?

26:01.250 --> 26:04.800
Emoji's are way more fun
and if he's not that into it,

26:04.870 --> 26:07.300
you can pretend like you were
talking about something else.

26:07.380 --> 26:09.930
Right. Nate's gonna think
I was dying to tell him

26:10.000 --> 26:14.220
about a dancing lady
carrying a burning eggplant.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.770
Here, use words.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.150
It's erotic but vulnerable.

26:20.220 --> 26:21.810
Okay, let me see it.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.410
I'm not saying "bulge."

26:28.490 --> 26:32.830
Sula the Wolf Witch talked
about smothering a demon.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.370
Does that make sense to you?

26:35.380 --> 26:39.380
When Mallus was a part of me
I could feel his fear.

26:39.460 --> 26:42.550
He was vulnerable here on Earth.

26:42.630 --> 26:44.880
It made him nervous.
So if we can separate

26:44.890 --> 26:47.060
the demon
from his earthly vessel,

26:47.130 --> 26:49.050
it will suffocate him.

26:49.060 --> 26:50.970
Just like a fish out of water.

26:51.040 --> 26:54.140
<i>Why are you even working
with that arrogant dick?</i>

26:54.210 --> 26:57.220
<i>He'll never value
your true power.</i>

26:57.240 --> 26:59.140
<i>Not like I will.</i>

26:59.220 --> 27:00.360
You all right there, love?

27:00.440 --> 27:03.730
Yeah.
I just need some coffee.

27:03.740 --> 27:05.400
I'm fine.

27:05.480 --> 27:09.150
- And I'm sober.
- Hey. Are you okay?

27:09.230 --> 27:11.570
I'm all right.

27:11.580 --> 27:14.450
Thanks.

27:14.530 --> 27:17.700
You best let her alone, Squire.

27:24.390 --> 27:27.380
This is all your mail!
You deal with it.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.260
It's not like you have an
address to even get mail, so.

27:33.270 --> 27:35.510
We both talked about it
and agreed

27:35.590 --> 27:38.350
that now wasn't the right time
for me to move in with you.

27:38.430 --> 27:40.100
But we're making it work.
Are we?

27:40.110 --> 27:41.690
Because how I see it,

27:41.760 --> 27:44.190
we're living completely
separate lives, so.

27:44.260 --> 27:47.110
Ava, I want this, just,
when the time is right.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.940
Timing doesn't just happen,
Sara.

27:48.950 --> 27:50.490
Okay, you have to make a choice.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.070
So what? This?
This is what you want?

27:53.150 --> 27:57.290
No, of course. Nobody just
wants dirty dishes but, yes.

27:57.370 --> 28:00.040
Ava, we are time-traveling
superheroes.

28:00.110 --> 28:02.290
Okay, fine,
but I'm not just my job.

28:02.300 --> 28:05.800
I want some hobbies.
I want... I want a life with you.

28:05.880 --> 28:09.550
And sometimes life is...
Is just this.

28:09.620 --> 28:11.050
Okay?
It's boring.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.770
What then?
You off to the next adventure?

28:12.840 --> 28:15.970
No! But I can't just decide
every single moment

28:15.980 --> 28:18.140
of forever right this instant.

28:18.150 --> 28:22.890
So please just tell me what you
want me to say and I'll say it

28:22.970 --> 28:25.440
and we can get out of here.

28:25.510 --> 28:26.980
I can't tell you what to say,
Sara,

28:26.990 --> 28:30.120
because then
it wouldn't mean anything.

28:30.190 --> 28:32.990
Okay, well.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.110
Let's just... let's move

28:35.190 --> 28:39.660
to the suburbs and we'll just
recycle until we die.

28:39.670 --> 28:40.830
Can we go now?

28:54.710 --> 28:56.470
Oh, no.

29:21.050 --> 29:23.120
It's just me.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.760
Let's talk.

29:28.200 --> 29:33.473
I've admired your power
for a long time, Nora.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.290
I don't take compliments from
people who frame me for murder.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.640
All in the interest
of self-preservation.

29:38.650 --> 29:40.680
You understand.

29:40.760 --> 29:44.190
Do they even know
what you're capable of?

29:44.200 --> 29:46.530
- They have no idea.
- Then why waste your time

29:46.610 --> 29:49.900
with that arrogant bastard
and his pathetic delusion

29:49.980 --> 29:51.780
that the world
needs him to save it?

29:51.850 --> 29:54.540
When I met John,
I was just a kid.

29:56.290 --> 29:57.660
<i>He was kind.</i>

29:57.670 --> 30:00.160
Mallus wanted me,
but I wasn't ready.

30:00.170 --> 30:02.450
But I'll tell you this.

30:02.530 --> 30:05.340
John did everything
he could to save me.

30:12.850 --> 30:15.350
But when he failed,
he abandoned me.

30:17.190 --> 30:20.100
John knew what the Order
were doing to me

30:20.170 --> 30:21.810
and he just let them.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.860
And he's the one who decides
who to send to hell.

30:25.720 --> 30:30.650
Cocky cowboy wearing his
hangover like a ten-gallon hat.

30:30.730 --> 30:32.360
He might have won
that last battle,

30:32.370 --> 30:34.110
but the war is mine.

30:34.190 --> 30:38.540
My Tabitha will be free soon
and when she is,

30:38.620 --> 30:41.120
we're gonna
put John away for good.

30:41.190 --> 30:46.040
Tabitha? That's why you
needed Ava as a vessel.

30:55.210 --> 30:57.880
There's a model for everyone.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.300
Are you looking
for one to clean?

31:00.380 --> 31:04.220
One to keep you safe?
One to... please you?

31:04.230 --> 31:06.520
No, you creep.

31:06.590 --> 31:08.850
I'm looking for Ava.

31:08.930 --> 31:10.070
They're all Ava.

31:10.150 --> 31:13.740
No, they're not.

31:13.820 --> 31:15.820
Just remember, pick quickly.

31:15.900 --> 31:17.250
Tabitha will be here soon

31:17.320 --> 31:19.030
and once she's here...

31:22.320 --> 31:24.290
Oh, no.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.700
Once she's here, what?

31:29.430 --> 31:33.500
<i>Attention, the store will
be closing in five minutes.</i>

31:39.340 --> 31:41.270
I can't believe
I got my dad killed.

31:41.350 --> 31:44.110
No, it was Hank's choice
to make a deal with a demon.

31:44.180 --> 31:45.770
That is not your fault.

31:45.780 --> 31:50.110
You spending time
with him inspired him.

31:50.190 --> 31:54.020
Made him happy.
I don't think you doomed him.

31:54.100 --> 31:55.690
I think you saved him.

32:00.360 --> 32:05.620
Here's to the man you helped
your dad become.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.000
You know what, Ray?
You're right.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.540
I shouldn't be embarrassed,
I should be proud.

32:10.620 --> 32:14.130
Yeah, my dad was a little wacky,
but most of the good ones are.

32:14.140 --> 32:17.800
He was a Legend and he should
be remembered that way.

32:21.050 --> 32:22.970
Ah!

32:22.980 --> 32:25.150
Mikey T!

32:25.220 --> 32:26.810
I got to stop him.

32:29.060 --> 32:31.310
Sara will never
let you take Ava.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.810
If not her,
I'll find someone else.

32:36.400 --> 32:40.570
You know, I can bring back
other people.

32:40.650 --> 32:43.160
Damien misses you so much.

32:47.250 --> 32:50.750
- You can bring my father...
- Of course.

32:50.820 --> 32:53.500
Now be a lamb and let me out,

32:53.510 --> 32:56.000
Nora, doll.

32:57.540 --> 33:00.010
You know, you can't just
walk out of here.

33:00.020 --> 33:03.180
Constantine
will never let you do that.

33:03.260 --> 33:05.930
Maybe as Desmond.

33:06.010 --> 33:08.470
But if you let me in,

33:08.550 --> 33:10.680
you, with my power?

33:10.690 --> 33:13.350
Nobody could stop us.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.410
The monitors were wonky.
Are you all right?

33:16.480 --> 33:19.440
Of course.
You shut them down.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.190
I should have never trusted you.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.210
Shut up, John.

33:35.580 --> 33:39.300
<i>Attention: the store will be
closing in two minutes.</i>

33:41.130 --> 33:44.560
Where is she?

33:44.640 --> 33:46.340
None of these are Ava.

33:46.420 --> 33:48.350
I'm not leaving without her!

34:09.590 --> 34:11.199
Ava.

34:14.449 --> 34:16.920
But you could have chosen
any one of those other women.

34:16.929 --> 34:19.840
I don't want other women.

34:19.909 --> 34:22.090
But I'm...

34:39.370 --> 34:40.480
- Hey.
- Oh.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.480
Hey.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.940
You did it.

34:45.020 --> 34:46.400
No.

34:46.480 --> 34:49.920
We did it.

34:49.989 --> 34:52.630
- We did it!
- Jeez.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.540
Let's do this.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.520
Nora.

35:23.810 --> 35:25.030
Now!

35:28.730 --> 35:32.910
Vessel... what a pretty word
for victim.

35:32.990 --> 35:35.950
Oh, I don't need your power,
Neron.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.290
I have my own.

35:37.360 --> 35:38.750
We've got him.

35:38.820 --> 35:41.250
Oh, just a few minutes more.

35:41.330 --> 35:42.880
Nora!

35:42.950 --> 35:44.670
Ray, no!

36:05.730 --> 36:08.290
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.650
It's okay.
It's okay, mate.

36:09.730 --> 36:11.450
It's all right.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.740
Where am I?

36:12.820 --> 36:14.160
You're safe.

36:14.230 --> 36:15.580
Nora?

36:19.630 --> 36:21.870
Nora?

36:25.890 --> 36:30.180
Eggplant's a little obvious. I say
you go with mushroom. Mushroom...

36:30.190 --> 36:33.390
Ava! You're back from the dead.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.970
- I knew you'd do it, Captain.
- Uh, gently.

36:35.050 --> 36:37.890
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh, nice job, boss.

36:38.150 --> 36:40.697
Okay, serious,
which emojis like...

36:40.698 --> 36:41.658
All right,
enough with the emoji.

36:41.678 --> 36:42.521
Hey!

36:42.546 --> 36:45.072
Just leave while you can.
You should just...

36:45.128 --> 36:46.628
Okay...

36:46.698 --> 36:49.128
You know, we should probably talk
about whether or not we want kids.

36:49.208 --> 36:52.728
Eh, let's wait until the other eight
are old enough to handle the news.

36:52.798 --> 36:54.888
I don't even know what
this text means anymore.

36:54.898 --> 36:57.308
"You up?
Hot dog, donut, thumbs up."

36:57.628 --> 36:59.608
Well, you wanna snog him, yeah?

36:59.678 --> 37:02.138
Or do you want him
to get diabetes?

37:02.148 --> 37:06.108
Okay, this doesn't sound
like me at all.

37:06.188 --> 37:07.818
You like him and he likes you,

37:07.828 --> 37:08.988
just tell him that.

37:13.358 --> 37:15.158
Okay, uh...

37:15.168 --> 37:19.618
"Want to go out sometime...

37:21.528 --> 37:24.748
...On a date"?

37:27.878 --> 37:29.508
Oh, yeah.
See? That wasn't so bad.

37:29.588 --> 37:31.388
Now, it's all on Nate.

37:34.338 --> 37:35.678
Oh, God.

37:35.688 --> 37:37.518
Oh, God, what did I do?

37:46.218 --> 37:48.978
Mikey, pick up.
Mikey, pick up.

37:49.058 --> 37:52.188
You can just drop that down.
You're not gonna need it.

37:58.278 --> 38:01.038
No.
Mikey, no!

38:01.118 --> 38:02.368
<i>Mikey!</i>

38:02.378 --> 38:04.328
Mikey, stop!

38:07.368 --> 38:08.748
Zari?

38:17.088 --> 38:19.848
Ha!

38:19.918 --> 38:22.558
Is that you, And Son?

38:22.628 --> 38:24.888
I changed my mind.

38:24.898 --> 38:27.938
What are you doing?
You should have just called.

38:27.948 --> 38:29.408
Jeez.

38:32.228 --> 38:34.488
I knew I should have synced
to the stupid cloud.

38:38.608 --> 38:39.568
Nate.

38:39.578 --> 38:42.288
- Hey.
- Hi, uh...

38:42.368 --> 38:44.868
So, um, uh, about...

38:44.948 --> 38:46.208
About that text...

38:46.288 --> 38:47.748
Oh, yeah, um...

38:47.758 --> 38:49.378
My phone had an unfortunate
run-in with

38:49.448 --> 38:50.668
a wrecking-ball, so, uh...

38:50.748 --> 38:51.958
Oh, my God.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.208
That sucks.

38:53.288 --> 38:55.418
What'd you wanna talk about?

38:55.498 --> 38:57.378
I... I... I just wanted to let
you know that

38:57.458 --> 39:00.308
Sara and Ava... they're good.

39:00.388 --> 39:01.898
- That's great!
- Yeah.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.188
Anything else
you wanna talk about?

39:06.598 --> 39:09.448
No, no, not that I can think of.

39:09.518 --> 39:11.558
Okay.
Cool, cool, cool.

39:11.638 --> 39:13.108
Glah... yeah, bye.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.328
Bye.

39:14.398 --> 39:16.578
Zari...
Bye.

39:20.748 --> 39:22.198
Hello?

39:22.278 --> 39:24.788
Is there anyone here
who can call me a cab?

39:24.798 --> 39:26.128
Anything you need, mate.

39:26.208 --> 39:27.798
I can get you a flight
to New Orleans,

39:27.868 --> 39:29.618
anywhere in the world,
you name it.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.788
No.

39:31.798 --> 39:34.498
I don't want anything from you.

39:34.578 --> 39:37.628
I'm not asking
for forgiveness, Des.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.978
Good.

39:39.048 --> 39:41.348
Just wait... wait, Des.

39:43.168 --> 39:45.388
You saved me, Johnny.

39:45.468 --> 39:48.938
I'm grateful for that.

39:49.008 --> 39:51.648
But it doesn't change anything.

39:51.718 --> 39:53.658
I know.

39:53.728 --> 39:56.688
You know I can make it
all go away, Des.

39:56.698 --> 39:58.828
This will make you forget.

40:00.498 --> 40:01.868
No.

40:03.908 --> 40:06.128
You sent me to hell.

40:10.078 --> 40:12.628
That's something we're both
gonna have to live with.

40:25.838 --> 40:27.848
How's she holding up, old son?

40:27.858 --> 40:31.348
She's stable, but unresponsive.

40:31.428 --> 40:33.598
Well, that's better
than the alternative.

40:33.678 --> 40:35.188
I couldn't let her
get hurt again.

40:35.198 --> 40:37.938
Oh, yeah, well, you just
rolled straight in there

40:38.018 --> 40:41.858
like a knight in shining armor
and nearly got her killed.

40:41.868 --> 40:43.158
I didn't mean to.

40:45.188 --> 40:46.538
Yeah, I know.

40:48.048 --> 40:52.288
She's a brave lass,
nearly cost her her life.

40:52.368 --> 40:54.588
But she killed that
bloody demon.

40:55.868 --> 40:57.338
She's amazing.

41:12.798 --> 41:16.058
We'll get you out of
this one, Nora.

41:16.138 --> 41:18.618
I'm not gonna abandon you again.

41:24.438 --> 41:26.448
Whoa.

41:26.458 --> 41:28.618
It's okay, boy.

41:28.688 --> 41:30.248
Dogs usually love me.
