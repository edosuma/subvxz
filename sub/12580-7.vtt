NANCY: [On TV]The Olympic torch is lit
from oie of the few eitities,,,

00:36.002 --> 00:37.902
older thai the games themselves,,,

00:38.004 --> 00:39.096
the sui,

00:43.009 --> 00:45.773
The flame iow begiis its loig jouriey
from Atheis, Greece,,,

00:45.879 --> 00:49.337
to its fiial destiiatioi,
Salt Lake City, Utah, USA,

00:49.449 --> 00:53.180
Aid the first leg is beiig rui by Greece 's
very owi Spiro Thaiatopoulis,,,

00:53.286 --> 00:57.188
who appareitly sa ved a whole herd
of goats from a ruiaway truck,

00:57.624 --> 01:01.492
Boy, I've always been a sucker
for the torch-lighting ceremony.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.856
That, and the four-man bobsled.

01:04.364 --> 01:07.697
I just wish they didn't have to
sit so close together.

01:08.301 --> 01:11.168
And remember,
Arlen is still looking for one local hero...

01:11.271 --> 01:13.762
to carry the flame
as it passes through town.

01:13.873 --> 01:17.434
You may drop off your essay at the station
or at any Pinky's Liquor.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.273
Look at Spiro's run.

01:19.412 --> 01:23.007
He reminds me of a young Hank Hill,
only hairier.

01:23.116 --> 01:26.517
I'd trade a village full of Spiri
for one Hank Hill.

01:26.619 --> 01:30.919
You took Arlen High to the Texas State
Football Championships, you did.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.651
And we would have won it all, too...

01:32.759 --> 01:36.695
if your ankle hadn't snapped
just two yards from the goal line.

01:36.796 --> 01:38.787
Yep. Your dad's a real hero.

01:38.898 --> 01:43.665
No, no. The guy who beat that shark away
with his own arm, he's a hero.

01:44.537 --> 01:47.438
I've toyed with the idea
of being a hero someday...

01:47.540 --> 01:51.306
either by doing something
or stopping something.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.502
Then I'll get a trophy.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.877
And then you'll have to build me
my very own trophy shelf.

01:55.982 --> 01:59.941
Well, actually, Bobby, I already have.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.388
Yeah, I started it
right after you were born.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.857
And then, well, you know.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.728
I tell you what.
The spider plants have thrived on it.

02:23.109 --> 02:24.940
Oh, not too close, Bobby.

02:25.044 --> 02:28.844
Those leafy green plants can suck
the oxygen right out of your body.

02:28.948 --> 02:31.212
Boy, look at all Dad's trophies.

02:31.317 --> 02:35.048
I'll never be able to win a trophy
or build a shelf.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.951
Oh, honey, you'll be able to win a trophy.

02:38.057 --> 02:42.153
I haven't won one yet
and my body's already starting to go.

02:42.562 --> 02:43.722
[Bobby sighs]

03:03.917 --> 03:04.884
Ow!

03:06.519 --> 03:09.386
Hey, Bobby. Look who's here. Me.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.556
Now, I know you thought
you'd never win a trophy...

03:12.659 --> 03:14.627
but that was before this.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.561
Congratulations!

03:19.165 --> 03:20.462
All right!

03:20.900 --> 03:24.028
Wait a minute.
I don't remember winning anything.

03:24.571 --> 03:27.802
-I don't remember competing for anything.
-Oh, yeah?

03:27.907 --> 03:31.434
Well, you won first place
in the international competition...

03:31.544 --> 03:34.877
for being the best you
you could possibly be, huh?

03:34.981 --> 03:37.108
You're one of the funniest people
in the house.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.276
You get most of your clothes
in the basket.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.752
And you always turn off the light
when you leave a room.

03:42.855 --> 03:45.016
Frankly, the contest wasn't even close.

03:45.124 --> 03:46.318
I don't know.

03:46.426 --> 03:49.520
It all sounds pretty much like
just getting up in the morning.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.359
Well, the great ones make it look easy.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.056
Look, Bobby.

03:54.167 --> 03:58.365
They don't give trophies
for being a sweet, sweet, sweet boy.

03:58.671 --> 04:01.902
But they should. And they have. I did.

04:04.711 --> 04:09.080
I'd like to thank my mother, my agent,
and my baby's mama.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.613
Things didn't look so good
at the beginning of the season...

04:12.785 --> 04:16.447
but they believed I could be
the best Bobby I could be.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.622
I wonder who'll get nominated
to carry the torch through Arlen.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.824
I think it ought to be that boy
down at the Waffle House.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.333
His Jesus T-shirts are an inspiration.

04:29.435 --> 04:33.235
And he buses those tables better than
most two-armed folks.

04:33.339 --> 04:34.670
No, he doesn't.

04:34.774 --> 04:38.175
Sausage, the breakfast of champions.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.011
-Hey, that's my trophy.
-It's my trophy.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.106
Mom gave it to me
for being the best me I could be.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.082
And I graciously accepted.

04:46.185 --> 04:50.554
It's a football trophy.
That's a running back fending off a tackler.

04:50.823 --> 04:54.657
I thought you said it was me putting
my nerf ball away in the toy hamper.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.490
Well, Bobby, it could....

04:56.763 --> 05:00.927
Well, it was just sitting in a box
gathering dust and dust-mite feces.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.398
So, this one is yours, too?

05:03.503 --> 05:07.405
Oh, for crying out loud.
How many trophies do you have?

05:07.540 --> 05:10.532
Look, Bobby,
I want to see you get a trophy, too.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.201
But you've gotta earn it.

05:12.312 --> 05:16.339
Now, most Little League teams
need a husky fellow to play catcher.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.417
And you like to wear masks.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.849
No, thanks.

05:20.386 --> 05:24.117
Hank, I am just trying
to boost that boy's self-esteem.

05:24.223 --> 05:27.659
You have a shelf full of awards
and a beautiful wife on your arm.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.523
Why can't Bobby have a trophy, too?

05:29.629 --> 05:33.588
You don't give someone an award
they don't deserve just to cheer them up.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.192
Why not make every Super Bowl a tie
so everyone gets a ring...

05:37.303 --> 05:39.294
and no one is ""bummed out""?

05:43.710 --> 05:47.703
Hank, I am having a brainstorm. Bobby!

05:48.047 --> 05:51.346
Honey, how would you like to carry
the Olympic torch?

05:51.651 --> 05:54.142
-You mean it?
-Don't make fun of the boy.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.814
I will write an essay nominating you.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.653
I will open with a joke,
but not at your expense...

05:59.759 --> 06:04.628
and I will close with a quotation
from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

06:04.897 --> 06:07.525
I'll go turn on your computer
and warm up the seat.

06:07.633 --> 06:08.861
Good boy.

06:09.869 --> 06:10.836
[Sighing]

06:11.604 --> 06:13.902
Defacing my trophy was bad enough.

06:14.006 --> 06:16.474
But now she's dragging
the Olympics into it?

06:16.576 --> 06:20.171
Just because Bobby wears a cape
doesn't make him a hero.

06:20.279 --> 06:21.746
It actually detracts.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.339
The same could not be said
of your average matador.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.414
I make a good point.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.751
There are so many more
deserving people in this town.

06:30.857 --> 06:33.291
She's just setting him up for a big fall...

06:33.393 --> 06:37.056
Iike when we told Bill
there was a woman out there for him.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.364
Hey!

06:39.532 --> 06:43.969
Today is the day. They're gonna
announce that I get to carry the torch.

06:44.103 --> 06:47.664
Although, to be true
to the ancient Olympians before me...

06:47.774 --> 06:49.674
I should be nude.

06:49.776 --> 06:54.338
Just in case you are chosen,
you're gonna have to run a half a mile.

06:54.447 --> 06:58.315
That's about 500 trips to the refrigerator,
just so you know.

06:58.518 --> 07:01.112
I know. That's why I've been training.

07:02.255 --> 07:05.486
Bobby, you seem to have a hitch
in your get-along.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.559
No, Dad. I'm speed walking.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.184
The only Olympic sport...

07:09.295 --> 07:13.254
endorsed by the American Association
of Retired Persons.

07:13.366 --> 07:16.335
-Easier on the knees.
-Beautiful, Bobby.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.596
[Car horn blaring]

07:17.870 --> 07:20.168
Congratulations, sug'!

07:20.273 --> 07:23.299
Oh, my God. I did it! I won!

07:23.409 --> 07:26.173
I'd jump for joy but, you know, the knees.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.803
Oh, what the heck?

07:27.914 --> 07:29.006
[Bobby exclaims]

07:29.849 --> 07:31.510
Bobby, you won.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.609
Oh, dang it,
I just took our camera in to be developed.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.154
To be fair, Hank, I wrote the essay.

07:37.256 --> 07:39.622
But why don't you let this be
Bobby's moment?

07:39.725 --> 07:42.694
Okay, who's ready for the big news?

07:44.730 --> 07:49.030
Mr. Hill, you will be running
the Arlen leg of the Olympic-torch relay.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.296
-Congratulations, Hank.
-Hank?

07:51.671 --> 07:54.799
But, Mom, you said I was gonna
get a trophy.

07:54.907 --> 07:58.070
Isn't that precious?
Now, give the torch to your daddy.

07:58.211 --> 08:02.011
You must want the Hank Hill
from West Arlen.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.446
Hold on. I've got some mail for him, too.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.950
It's you, sug'. Congratulations.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.544
I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your business...

08:09.655 --> 08:12.920
but the Durndle torch guy cried.
Very moving.

08:20.266 --> 08:23.360
So, how does it feel to be
the official torchbearer?

08:23.469 --> 08:26.666
Are you filled with pride? Humility?

08:27.473 --> 08:29.668
What are you filled with, sug'?
Arlen wants to know.

08:29.775 --> 08:32.369
Mostly confusion. See, I didn't--

08:32.477 --> 08:34.969
I will tell you what he is not filled with.
Shame.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.241
For nominating himself behind my back.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.716
I wonder what else you do back there
without me knowing.

08:39.818 --> 08:42.309
Let's get some B-roll of me smiling.

08:42.621 --> 08:47.184
I didn't nominate myself. I haven't written
an essay since high school.

08:47.293 --> 08:51.730
And I specifically remember,
it was not ""Why I Should Carry the Torch.""

08:52.098 --> 08:53.861
It was about hammers.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.696
It's okay. You deserve it more than I do.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.604
You're a good loser, Son.

08:59.705 --> 09:03.163
Thanks. Maybe someday
I'll get a trophy for that.

09:06.546 --> 09:10.744
So, Hank, if you did not write that essay,
who did?

09:10.883 --> 09:14.148
I don't know.
Probably just some satisfied customer.

09:14.253 --> 09:17.347
The identity of the secret essay writer's
a secret.

09:17.456 --> 09:18.787
Until now.

09:18.891 --> 09:22.349
Paragraph one, paragraph two,
Hank's signature.

09:22.528 --> 09:25.964
What? Dang it, Dale.
You remember how mad I was...

09:26.065 --> 09:28.727
when you guys washed my truck
without permission.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.358
But you were right, Hank.

09:30.469 --> 09:33.336
The torch should go to someone
really deserving.

09:33.439 --> 09:36.772
And that's you.
Even if we didn't win State.

09:36.909 --> 09:41.073
After all, Hank, America is not
just a land of opportunity...

09:41.180 --> 09:43.205
it is a land of redemption.

09:43.516 --> 09:44.483
[Sniffing]

09:44.884 --> 09:47.079
-It's from the essay.
-Damn, that's good.

09:47.186 --> 09:49.780
Hoist her up. Let's see how she looks.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.418
[All cheering]

09:58.264 --> 09:59.458
[Exclaiming in pain]

09:59.565 --> 10:01.760
This salsa's stinging my cuts.

10:02.835 --> 10:07.033
I'm fixing to bring out the tortilla chips.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.197
[All cheering]

10:08.307 --> 10:11.572
How's it feel, Dad?
Is it everything I hoped it would be?

10:11.677 --> 10:13.008
I don't want to be here.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.876
And I wouldn't be
if Dale hadn't baked all day.

10:15.982 --> 10:19.577
Well, then, you shouldn't have had
your henchmen write that essay.

10:19.685 --> 10:22.984
Y'all want to see what Dale's been keeping
in the basement for the last 20 years?

10:23.089 --> 10:24.078
[All protesting]

10:24.190 --> 10:28.149
No, no, not that. I made him donate that
to the teaching hospital.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.557
Boomhauer.

10:30.863 --> 10:33.661
The year is 1979.

10:33.766 --> 10:37.998
Every week the entire nation turns
for hope to Laverie aid Shirley,

10:38.504 --> 10:43.032
Ted Koppel arranges to have 44 Americans
held hostage on a soundstage...

10:43.142 --> 10:47.044
in Burbank by actors impersonating
lranian fanatics.

10:47.313 --> 10:51.443
And Arlen's leading all-time rusher
is Hank Hill!

10:51.550 --> 10:52.676
[All cheering]

10:52.918 --> 10:57.651
The hopes and dreams of a small
Texas town in the state of Texas...

10:57.757 --> 11:02.592
rest squarely on the broad athletic
shoulders of their star running back...

11:02.695 --> 11:05.391
and his trusted towel manager.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.056
Look at Hank go!

11:07.600 --> 11:11.195
Running all over those men. He doesn't
care who he steps on to get his glory.

11:11.303 --> 11:12.827
Nothing's changed.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.503
Touchdown!

11:19.245 --> 11:22.305
Okay, stop it. No one wants to watch this.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.249
Hey, who wants to dance?
Dale, help me move that couch.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.820
-Dang it.
-What's the matter, Hank?

11:29.922 --> 11:32.516
You don't want to see the part
where you broke your ankle?

11:32.625 --> 11:35.389
Film's a little grainy,
but I think you can see bone.

11:35.494 --> 11:38.019
Yeah, man. It's like he's going back there
in the pocket...

11:38.130 --> 11:41.497
and you'll see that old snap.
And then you hear that snap. Oh, man!

11:41.600 --> 11:45.866
I don't want to see my ankle,
and I don't want to carry the dang torch.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.578
-Anyone want to see Nancy in an art film?
-Sug'!

12:01.120 --> 12:02.314
Dad...

12:03.489 --> 12:07.186
someday someone's gonna make
the world's largest fruit pie.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.658
And the next day...

12:08.761 --> 12:12.663
I'm gonna get in the Guinness Book
of World Records for eating it.

12:12.765 --> 12:16.223
Bobby, I'm not in the mood for riddles
right now.

12:16.335 --> 12:19.998
I'm just saying I hope you aren't
backing out because you feel bad for me.

12:20.139 --> 12:24.075
I'll have my moment in the sun someday.
But this one's yours.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.412
You're a hero.
You took Arlen High to State.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.775
I'm not a hero. I'm a disgrace.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.719
BOBBY: Okay, your trousers are filthy.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.847
But so were everybody else's.
Forget about it.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.186
Keep watching.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.386
[Bobby exclaims]

12:44.597 --> 12:46.030
There's more.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.357
That's amazing!

12:49.468 --> 12:53.370
I didn't realize people
walked like Egyptians back then.

12:53.572 --> 12:57.702
It's shameful, the worst kind
of useless showboating.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.443
The only thing missing was an earring.

13:00.746 --> 13:03.681
And on the very next play,
going for the two-point conversion...

13:03.816 --> 13:05.909
that would have won us
the championship...

13:06.018 --> 13:07.679
I broke my ankle.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.551
God was punishing me for being prideful.

13:11.223 --> 13:13.054
He didn't give me a fatal heart attack...

13:13.159 --> 13:15.787
because he still wanted me
to sell propane.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.522
But He made his point.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.824
That's crazy.

13:18.931 --> 13:23.197
God wasn't punishing you,
it was just a coincidence.

13:23.402 --> 13:25.870
No, it wasn't. It was God.

13:26.405 --> 13:29.101
Is this why you're so uptight all the time...

13:29.208 --> 13:32.974
because you think something bad
is gonna happen if you act happy?

13:33.078 --> 13:34.045
[Sighing]

13:35.047 --> 13:36.071
[Mumbling]

13:36.182 --> 13:40.448
Remember when you saw that bumper
sticker, ""Honk if You Love America""?

13:40.553 --> 13:44.114
You smiled, pumped your arm,
and honked twice.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.884
I do love America.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.482
And your car didn't go off the road.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.993
You're right. We drove home safely.

13:53.265 --> 13:55.392
You know, he's only 13 years old...

13:55.501 --> 14:00.370
but maybe Bobby is onto something
with this ""it's okay to feel good"" stuff.

14:00.606 --> 14:04.167
Well, if Bobby says it's all right for you
to run with the torch...

14:04.276 --> 14:07.404
I will not oppose him.
And I will not oppose you.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.375
I will let you run unopposed.

14:12.551 --> 14:16.544
I know running with the torch won't
get me on the front of a Wheaties box...

14:16.655 --> 14:20.455
but it sure does give me that
front-of-a-Wheaties-box feeling.

14:20.559 --> 14:23.050
Come on. Less talky, more walky.

14:23.162 --> 14:25.392
Give me another 0.5 miles.

14:25.497 --> 14:26.589
[Hank chuckling]

14:31.170 --> 14:33.400
Hot or cold towel, Hank?

14:33.672 --> 14:37.073
Well, my torch hand is getting
a little slippery.

14:37.443 --> 14:40.640
Look at us, it's just like
when we were in high school.

14:40.746 --> 14:43.613
You secreting, me absorbing.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.277
And you know, these are the
very same towels from back then.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.914
Hey, it's Hank Hill, the torch guy.

14:50.022 --> 14:53.048
You were 12 across in today's
Arlei Bystaider crossword puzzle.

14:53.158 --> 14:55.786
Will you sign it for me? In pencil?

14:57.263 --> 14:59.060
ALL: [Chanting] Hank! Hank! Hank!

14:59.164 --> 15:01.826
Come on. Give them a little taste, Dad.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.892
[Crowd chanting]

15:07.873 --> 15:10.842
Okay. Remember, honey,
you're going to be on TV...

15:10.943 --> 15:13.810
so do not do that thing with your nose
that you're not aware of.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.005
What thing?

15:15.948 --> 15:19.384
I'm here live with Arlen torchbearer,
Hank Hill.

15:19.485 --> 15:22.545
Which hand do you think
you will carry the torch in?

15:22.655 --> 15:23.622
The right.

15:23.722 --> 15:26.247
Did you give any thought
to any other hand?

15:26.358 --> 15:27.825
No, I did not.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.188
[Crowd cheering]

15:33.299 --> 15:36.325
Sounds like the Durndle
Torchbearer approacheth.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.596
Finally. It took him forever.

15:38.704 --> 15:41.468
Well, they're not exactly swift in Durndle.

15:46.812 --> 15:49.007
Oh, he is so brave.

15:56.388 --> 15:57.412
[Crowd cheering]

15:57.523 --> 15:59.388
Hank, wait!

16:00.993 --> 16:02.153
Dang it, Dale.

16:02.261 --> 16:07.198
This flame traveled 3,000 miles,
plus the distance from the sun to Greece.

16:07.533 --> 16:10.400
You're tarnishing the spirit
of the Winter Games.

16:10.502 --> 16:13.300
Au coitraire, I am inhaling it.

16:14.940 --> 16:19.707
Remember, Dad. Haste, grace and dignity.
Now, move out!

16:24.183 --> 16:25.309
Yeah!

16:25.784 --> 16:28.878
WOMAN: Way to go! Way to go, Hank!

16:29.154 --> 16:32.715
Oh, my God. Stop him.
He's running in the wrong direction!

16:34.994 --> 16:38.191
Oh, no, he's not. He's not, people!
Everything's fine!

16:41.367 --> 16:44.393
I'm so darn happy
I'd skip the rest of the way.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.729
Thank you, Bobby.

16:54.747 --> 16:55.941
[Whooping]

17:11.096 --> 17:12.154
[Exclaiming]

17:16.734 --> 17:18.031
Oh, no.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.003
Hank. Have you been shot?

17:21.106 --> 17:23.438
No. But I deserve to be.

17:24.309 --> 17:28.268
Oh, my God! The flame is out!
The Olympics are over.

17:28.947 --> 17:32.906
Those poor athletes.
All their training for nothing.

17:33.018 --> 17:36.749
You see, Bobby?
This is what happens when you act happy.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.589
Thanks a lot.

17:38.957 --> 17:41.016
I was just trying to help.

17:41.126 --> 17:44.254
Okay. I will go find an Olympic official.

17:44.496 --> 17:46.361
Or would you like to
turn yourself in, Hank?

17:46.465 --> 17:50.299
No. I already ruined the most important
game in Texas history.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.632
I'm not gonna ruin these games.

17:53.205 --> 17:55.173
All right, here's the plan.

17:55.274 --> 17:58.937
I didn't fall and the flame didn't go out.

17:59.344 --> 18:01.175
Is everybody clear on the plan?

18:01.346 --> 18:05.476
That's not the real flame. That's just fire.
It's cheating.

18:05.584 --> 18:09.714
No, no, it's fine.
It looks exactly like the old flame.

18:20.299 --> 18:21.561
[Crowd cheering]

18:27.172 --> 18:29.766
He's running with a flaming lie.

18:29.875 --> 18:34.209
How am I gonna enjoy the figure skating
with this dark cloud hanging over us?

18:34.346 --> 18:36.712
Bobby, if your father doesn't go through
with this...

18:36.815 --> 18:40.444
the Hills will be forever known
as the family that ruined the Olympics.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.520
Now, I can go back
to using my maiden name.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.054
I have no idea what you will do.

18:46.892 --> 18:49.725
Come on, Arlen!
Only 20 more feet and it's all you.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.296
Yeah, you got it!
This is for the rings, baby!

19:05.444 --> 19:06.411
What the....

19:06.778 --> 19:10.305
Come on, man.
It's only a couple more steps.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.041
Why is he slowing down?

19:12.151 --> 19:14.642
He's 40. Cut him some slack.

19:14.753 --> 19:18.189
Stop hot-dogging it.
You had your time in the sun.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.690
Come on, baby. Give me some flame.

19:20.792 --> 19:21.759
[Sighing]

19:29.501 --> 19:30.559
[Crowd exclaiming]

19:31.170 --> 19:32.228
[Booing]

19:34.173 --> 19:35.868
What are you doing?

19:36.975 --> 19:39.136
Oh, man. That is weak.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.609
He put it out.

19:40.712 --> 19:45.240
'Cause he's a quitter. I never quit.
Hell, I've been smoking for 30 years.

19:48.587 --> 19:49.884
The flame!

19:51.023 --> 19:53.218
My oral fixation!

19:55.060 --> 19:58.223
But you don't understand.
That wasn't the real flame.

19:58.330 --> 20:02.926
You don't understand. I lost 500 pounds.
I'm a hero.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.835
Don't worry, Dad!
I'm coming as fast as I can!

20:06.939 --> 20:10.602
This cigarette was lit
with the Olympic torch.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.041
The flame lives!

20:14.780 --> 20:18.375
-All right, Bobby.
-It's going out.

20:18.483 --> 20:22.078
Mr. Gribble, smoke!

20:42.174 --> 20:45.541
Hold on. Bobby, you earned it.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.481
All right. The last guy put it out.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.384
The bar's pretty low, Todd. You can do it!

20:57.522 --> 20:58.887
That's right, Mc Maynerbury.

20:58.991 --> 21:03.360
Brother running with the torch
and not a damn thing you can do about it.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.773
For preserving the honor and integrity...

21:21.880 --> 21:24.644
of the Olympic flame
and all it represents...

21:24.750 --> 21:28.413
I hereby award this trophy to Bobby Hill.

21:29.988 --> 21:34.186
I guess if you wanted to do
a celebration dance, that'd be all right.

21:35.394 --> 21:36.827
Not now, Dad.

21:43.602 --> 21:44.626
Now!

21:44.970 --> 21:46.130
[Humming]

21:50.409 --> 21:53.105
HANK: Okay, that's eiough, Bobby,

22:28.146 --> 22:29.943
BlLL: Uh huh, Hey!
