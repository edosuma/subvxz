Boys, what are you doing
back here?

03:43.349 --> 03:44.642
I asked you a question.

03:57.363 --> 03:58.239
Gross, dude!

03:59.490 --> 04:00.950
Well, hey,
if I didn't know any better,

04:01.075 --> 04:02.993
I'd think you boys
had been smoking!

04:03.118 --> 04:05.329
No.
No, Mr. Mackey.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.914
We don't have any cigarettes.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.123
Well, you'd better not.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.542
Because let me tell you
something about smoking.

04:10.668 --> 04:13.629
Uh, smoking's bad, m'kay.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.258
And, uh, if you start smoking
at an early age, m'kay,

04:17.383 --> 04:18.634
I-it's gonna be bad.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.843
M'kay?

04:19.969 --> 04:22.763
Because, uh, smoking can lead to
all kinds of health problems,

04:22.888 --> 04:23.973
like cancer.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.600
M'kay, and let me tell you
something about cancer, m'kay.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.436
Uh, cancer's bad.
M'kay?

04:29.561 --> 04:32.439
And, uh -- What --
What the...

04:32.564 --> 04:35.025
Holy shit, m'kay!

04:38.946 --> 04:41.323
Aah!
Jesus Christ!

04:45.828 --> 04:46.829
Whoops.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.958
Well, you boys have
certainly done it this time!

04:51.083 --> 04:52.876
We're sorry.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.378
Not as sorry
as you're going to be

04:54.503 --> 04:56.463
when your parents get here --
Ah. Here they come now.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.881
Oh, God.

04:59.842 --> 05:02.136
Come on in.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.806
Stanley, what did you do
this time?

05:05.931 --> 05:07.641
You'd better brace yourselves,
parents.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.269
The boys were caught...smoking.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.229
Smoking?!

05:12.354 --> 05:13.689
No.
It can't be.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.733
My son is not a filthy smoker.

05:15.858 --> 05:18.110
Mom...Dad, it was just --

05:18.235 --> 05:19.737
I don't have a son!

05:19.862 --> 05:22.114
Eric! You've done a lot of
horrible things in your life.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.365
But smoking?

05:23.490 --> 05:25.159
You're grounded for three weeks.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.453
Three weeks?
Are you fucking kidding me?

05:27.578 --> 05:30.789
Haven't you boys heard anything
about how harmful smoking is

05:30.914 --> 05:31.915
to you and those around you?

05:32.041 --> 05:32.958
Of course they haven't,

05:33.083 --> 05:35.419
because the tobacco companies
have gotten to them first.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.296
This is really their fault.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.506
Yeah!
This is really their fault.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.259
No matter how much money
the antismoking groups spend,

05:42.384 --> 05:44.845
the tobacco companies are there
to fill our children's heads

05:44.970 --> 05:47.765
with lies and propaganda
that make them want to smoke.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.099
Yeah, huh?

05:49.224 --> 05:51.352
It's like the tobacco companies
have control of my mind.

05:51.477 --> 05:53.437
No. Must fight it.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.398
Tobacco companies making me
want to smoke.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.233
Oh, my goodness.
I had no idea.

05:58.359 --> 05:59.818
Are you okay, sweetie?

05:59.943 --> 06:01.653
Well, those Goddamn
tobacco companies

06:01.779 --> 06:03.614
aren't gonna have control
over <i>my</i> kid!

06:03.739 --> 06:05.324
I say we bring them down!

06:05.449 --> 06:06.950
We need the help of the greatest

06:07.076 --> 06:10.996
antismoking celebrity
that ever lived -- Rob Reiner.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.665
Who's Rob Reiner?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.128
I don't understand it.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.923
I pushed a law for higher taxes
on cigarettes.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.883
I lobbied to get images
of cigarettes

06:23.008 --> 06:24.343
removed from movies and art.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.887
I forced smokers out of bars
and parks.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.847
But still I get letters
from parents

06:28.972 --> 06:30.766
saying their kids are doing it.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.604
Apparently,
people still don't understand

06:35.729 --> 06:37.189
how bad smoking is for them.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.650
Don't they know how dangerous
it is to their health?

06:39.775 --> 06:42.319
Don't they know the hazard
of secondhand smoke?

06:42.444 --> 06:43.737
According to the letter, sir,

06:43.862 --> 06:46.407
the town has a tobacco company
quite near them.

06:46.532 --> 06:47.866
Yeah.
That must be it.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.244
The tobacco companies,
with their millions of dollars

06:50.369 --> 06:52.663
and their slick desks
and fancy buildings --

06:52.788 --> 06:55.040
They're the ones
making children want to smoke.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.836
They're the ones hurting
our nation's health.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.630
I will not stand by
and see the children of America

07:01.755 --> 07:03.507
corrupted by those bastards!

07:03.632 --> 07:05.467
This is war!

07:09.888 --> 07:11.932
You guys, maybe we should
come clean right now

07:12.057 --> 07:13.600
and tell everyone it <i>wasn't</i>
the tobacco companies

07:13.725 --> 07:14.601
that made us want to smoke.

07:14.726 --> 07:15.853
What?
- Why? It's perfect.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.438
If everyone's blaming
the tobacco companies,

07:17.563 --> 07:18.564
then nobody's blaming us.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.606
Yeah.
What's the problem?

07:19.731 --> 07:22.276
It's just that this seems like
another one of those times

07:22.401 --> 07:24.194
when things are gonna get
way out of hand.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.988
It's been happening a lot
lately.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.365
How about this time we just
put a stop to it right now?

07:28.490 --> 07:30.784
You don't want to be grounded
for three weeks, do you?

07:30.909 --> 07:31.827
Yeah. Don't worry, dude.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.245
Things aren't gonna
get out of hand.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.247
Here he comes!

07:46.884 --> 07:49.219
Damn it.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.888
Butter!

07:51.013 --> 07:52.055
Butter!

07:52.181 --> 07:53.348
What'd he say?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.225
Butter!

08:14.786 --> 08:16.830
Hello, South Park!

08:20.292 --> 08:23.253
It is so nice to see
an entire town come together

08:23.378 --> 08:25.339
to fight for good health.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.466
And I'm gonna help you!

08:29.301 --> 08:30.802
These poor, innocent children

08:30.928 --> 08:33.347
have been seduced
into smoking tobacco.

08:33.472 --> 08:36.683
So I say we fight fire
with fire!

08:36.808 --> 08:38.435
We're gonna use these children

08:38.560 --> 08:40.854
to bring the tobacco company
down!

08:44.316 --> 08:46.568
Oh, no.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.366
All right, kids.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.492
Here's what we're gonna do.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.536
We're gonna sneak you
into the tobacco company

08:55.661 --> 08:58.914
by saying you kids want a tour
for a school paper.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.958
Once you're inside, I'm gonna --

09:01.083 --> 09:04.002
I'm gonna take photos,
and then we'll publish them,

09:04.127 --> 09:06.713
saying that the tobacco company
invited you over

09:06.838 --> 09:08.340
to seduce you into smoking.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.050
Got it?
- Got it!

09:10.801 --> 09:13.011
But...isn't that kind of lying?

09:13.136 --> 09:15.931
We're just leveling
out the playing field.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.059
The tobacco companies lie to you
about the dangers of smoking.

09:19.184 --> 09:22.521
If we're gonna take them down,
we've got to lie right back.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.989
Oh my God!

09:38.704 --> 09:40.163
Excuse me!

09:40.289 --> 09:41.748
Yes?

09:41.873 --> 09:44.459
Would you mind putting
that death stick out?

09:44.585 --> 09:46.295
But, uh, this is a bar.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.589
Isn't smoking illegal
in bars here?

09:48.714 --> 09:50.132
Not in Colorado.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.091
Oh, my God!

09:51.216 --> 09:53.594
What kind of backward hick state
is this?

09:53.719 --> 09:56.305
Look, man, I work 14 hours a day
at the sawmill.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.515
I just got off work,
and I need to relax.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.935
Well, when I relax, I just go
to my vacation house in Hawaii.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.354
I ain't got a vacation house
in Hawaii.

10:04.479 --> 10:07.774
Y-Your vacation house in Mexico,
then -- whatever it is!

10:07.899 --> 10:11.653
Look, you are putting my life
and these boys' lives in danger

10:11.778 --> 10:12.988
by smoking that in here.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.157
And I am not gonna tolerate it!

10:15.282 --> 10:17.951
I will end smoking in bars
in Colorado.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.829
There will be no more smoking!

10:20.954 --> 10:23.123
Isn't he awesome, you guys?
- What?

10:23.248 --> 10:25.459
Dude, he just goes around
imposing his will on people.

10:25.584 --> 10:26.877
He's my idol.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.006
All right, boys.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.382
Just do what I tell you,

10:32.507 --> 10:35.927
and we'll be able to sue this
tobacco company for $2 billion.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.221
As soon as we get
into the main facility,

10:38.347 --> 10:41.099
I'll snap the photo of you kids,
and we can all run out.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.268
Think you can handle it?
- Handle it?

10:43.393 --> 10:46.021
For $2 billion, I'd handle
my grandpa's balls, sir.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.356
All right.
Great.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.358
Okay.
Now watch yourselves, kids.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.902
These tobacco-company people
will do anything

10:52.027 --> 10:53.487
to get you hooked on smoking.

10:53.612 --> 10:56.323
They are liars,
and they are frauds.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.450
Can I help you?

10:58.575 --> 11:01.536
Yes. My name is Rita Poon.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.247
I called about my boys
wanting a tour.

11:04.373 --> 11:05.624
Ah, yes, Mrs. Poon.

11:05.749 --> 11:06.750
My name's Kevin Harris,

11:06.875 --> 11:08.835
and I'm the vice president
of Big Tobacco.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.254
Well, hello, Mr. Harris.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.673
Well, come on in.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.675
How about a little history
first?

11:14.800 --> 11:17.803
Native Americans were the first
to cultivate the tobacco plant.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.054
They smoked it in pipes

11:19.179 --> 11:21.223
for medicinal
and ceremonial purposes.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.725
Not if I were around,
they wouldn't have.

11:23.850 --> 11:24.601
Excuse me?

11:24.726 --> 11:26.478
Oh, nothing!
Please continue.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.230
The first successful
commercial crop of tobacco

11:28.355 --> 11:30.565
was cultivated in Virginia
in 1612.

11:30.691 --> 11:31.566
Within seven years,

11:31.692 --> 11:33.694
it was one of the country's
largest exports.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.821
So tobacco helped to build
America.

11:35.946 --> 11:36.863
That's right.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.281
Over the next few centuries,

11:38.407 --> 11:39.950
the tobacco business
was so great

11:40.075 --> 11:41.284
that many slaves were brought
from Africa

11:41.410 --> 11:42.703
to help work the fields.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.705
Which means
if it weren't for tobacco,

11:44.830 --> 11:47.082
many of our black friends
wouldn't be here today.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.168
And so for centuries,
tobacco production flourished.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.504
Nobody was even aware
of any dangers back then,

11:52.629 --> 11:55.757
until, in 1965,
when Congress passed an act

11:55.882 --> 11:57.092
forcing all tobacco companies

11:57.217 --> 11:59.469
to put the Surgeon General's
warning on their packages.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.972
So now everyone knows
the dangers of smoking,

12:02.097 --> 12:03.807
and some people
still choose to do it,

12:03.932 --> 12:06.768
and we believe that's what
being an American is all about.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.603
That sounds
perfectly reasonable.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.480
And here's our factory at work.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.523
Oh. Here, boys.
Let me get your picture.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.276
Got it!
Ha!

12:56.401 --> 12:58.361
You bastards are going down now!

12:58.487 --> 13:00.405
What?
- I'm not Rita Poon.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.617
I'm Rob Reiner!
And you've just been Reinered!

13:03.742 --> 13:05.952
Come on, boys!
Let's make our escape!

13:06.536 --> 13:07.871
Don't you try and stop us!

13:07.996 --> 13:08.997
Oh!

13:13.710 --> 13:15.212
Oh, my God!

13:15.796 --> 13:17.923
Oh, boy.
That was great, kids.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.634
Those people at the tobacco
company all seem really nice.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.553
Yeah. You see that?
They got into your head.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.014
Now you kids can meet
some good, decent people --

13:26.139 --> 13:29.017
the folks who work
to get smoking banned.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.443
This is how we get rid
of smokers.

13:38.568 --> 13:42.072
We go state to state and do
things like use bogus studies

13:42.197 --> 13:46.034
and make expensive commercials
to get the public on our side

13:46.159 --> 13:49.079
and force cigarette smokers
to stop.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.205
Wow.
It's like --

13:50.330 --> 13:52.791
It's like smoking brings a lot
of people just a little of joy,

13:52.916 --> 13:54.835
and you get to take that
away from them.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.253
You are so awesome.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.462
Here you go, Bob.

13:57.587 --> 14:00.882
This is Mr. Valkri.
He does all our Photoshop work.

14:01.007 --> 14:04.094
Now all we have to do
is photoshop cigarettes

14:04.219 --> 14:05.554
into your hands -- and bingo!

14:05.679 --> 14:08.390
When this hits the papers,
the tobacco company is screwed!

14:11.393 --> 14:13.436
But, dude,
you're making stuff up.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.689
You kids need to understand
something, okay?

14:15.814 --> 14:17.732
Sometimes lying is okay,

14:17.858 --> 14:21.653
like when you know what's good
for people more than they do.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.364
Oh, my God. That is exactly
what <i>I've</i> always said.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.824
I love this guy.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.701
Mr. Reiner,
your bill to have smoking

14:27.826 --> 14:29.578
outlawed in bars here
didn't pass.

14:29.703 --> 14:30.579
What?!

14:30.704 --> 14:31.580
God damn it!

14:31.705 --> 14:33.665
What the hell is wrong
with people in this state?

14:33.790 --> 14:35.542
Apparently, several people here
still believe

14:35.667 --> 14:37.711
there's no proof
secondhand smoke can kill you.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.629
They want proof?

14:39.754 --> 14:41.715
All right.
We'll give them proof!

14:41.840 --> 14:44.718
Boys, I need one of you
to act in a commercial for us.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.386
We'll shoot it tomorrow.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.888
Wow!
A commercial?

14:48.013 --> 14:51.099
You boys decide which one of you
would be best for the part.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.100
All right, people!

14:52.225 --> 14:55.270
We got to get moving on the bill
to ban smoking in parks here!

14:55.395 --> 14:56.438
Let's go!

14:56.563 --> 14:58.106
God.
He's just the best!

14:58.231 --> 14:59.983
Mr. Reiner,
can I get you a muffin?

15:00.108 --> 15:01.359
Or -- Or a cold drink perhaps?

15:01.484 --> 15:03.987
You guys, I think we should
bail out of this right now.

15:04.112 --> 15:04.821
Huh?

15:04.946 --> 15:06.156
I just know
where this is heading.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.283
It's gonna end up with the whole
town taking this too far

15:08.408 --> 15:10.285
and us having to talk about
what we learned

15:10.410 --> 15:11.578
to change everyone's minds.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.331
I say we just stop it right now
and go play cards or something.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.457
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

15:15.582 --> 15:16.583
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.336
So, gentlemen,
looks like only one of us

15:19.461 --> 15:20.879
gets to be
in the commercial, huh?

15:21.004 --> 15:22.088
Who will it be?

15:22.213 --> 15:24.049
Gentlemen, the game is on.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.468
Go ahead. We don't want to be
in their stupid commercial.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.511
Huh?
Oh, I get it, Kyle.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.138
That's your Serbian-Jew
double bluff --

15:30.263 --> 15:32.182
make me think you don't care
about being in the commercial

15:32.307 --> 15:33.475
so maybe I won't either.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.935
Oops.
Didn't work, did it, Kyle?

15:35.060 --> 15:37.187
No, we really want nothing more
to do with these people.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.272
Sure you don't, Kyle.
Oh, and neither do I.

15:39.397 --> 15:40.815
I know what
you're gonna say next.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.859
"How about none of us
show up tomorrow to do it?"

15:42.984 --> 15:44.778
And I'm supposed to agree
so that tomorrow

15:44.903 --> 15:46.988
you can waltz in all by yourself
and do the commercial.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.200
That's Serbian-Jew double bluff,
and it ain't gonna work on me.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.493
Heh heh heh.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.078
Only one of us can be
in the commercial, gentlemen.

15:53.203 --> 15:56.289
The game...is on.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.179
Sorry, Kyle, but I'm afraid
only one of us

16:11.304 --> 16:13.556
will be showing up to do the
commercial tomorrow!

16:13.682 --> 16:16.142
Thought you had me with your
Serbian-Jew double bluff.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.019
Well, let's see you try
to open this door now.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.482
What are you doing?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.611
Oh.
Hello, Kyle.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.490
Oh -- Oh, man.
Wait. This isn't my house.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.492
Cartman, you go ahead
and do the commercial tomorrow.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.493
But I'm warning you --

16:33.618 --> 16:35.578
Those antismoking people
are liars and they're bullies

16:35.704 --> 16:37.455
who will stop at nothing
to get what they want,

16:37.580 --> 16:39.165
and that means
they're dangerous.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.548
Nice try, Kyle!

16:46.673 --> 16:48.383
Let's see you try to get
through this door now.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.723
Okay, Eric.
This is gonna be real simple.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.433
All you got to do
is just read the words

16:56.558 --> 16:58.018
on the Teleprompter here.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.269
Okay.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.646
Let's see how the tobacco
companies deal with this.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.482
All right. Roll camera.
Roll the Teleprompter.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.192
And whenever you're ready, Eric.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.569
Okay. Okay.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.824
You know, some people say
there's no proof

17:12.949 --> 17:14.325
that secondhand smoke kills.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.119
The tobacco companies say
there's no proof

17:16.244 --> 17:17.871
that secondhand smoke kills.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.665
I've just been diagnosed
with terminal lung cancer.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.917
I guess...I'm the proof.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.419
The next time
you want to believe

17:24.544 --> 17:27.630
that secondhand smoke
doesn't kill, think about me.

17:27.756 --> 17:32.218
Because by the time you see
this commercial, I'll be dead.

17:33.678 --> 17:34.554
Dead?

17:34.679 --> 17:36.681
And cut! Great! We got it.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.017
Wrap out, people.
That was fantastic.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.269
Uh, what -- what does that mean,
"I'll be dead"?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.397
Hey, uh, what --
what was that "dead" part?

17:44.522 --> 17:45.899
That was very good, Eric.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.777
Here.
Eat this cupcake.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.488
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.572
But you are.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.574
Just eat this one cupcake.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.535
It has sprinkles.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.038
I'm not eating the cupcake.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.582
Eric, do you know
what a hero is?

18:02.707 --> 18:05.251
A hero is somebody
who sacrifices himself

18:05.376 --> 18:06.795
for the good of others.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.379
You can be a hero, Eric.

18:08.505 --> 18:12.342
All you have to do
is eat the cupcake.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.220
Jesus Christ!

18:15.345 --> 18:16.638
Aah!
- Hey!

18:27.190 --> 18:28.566
What are you doing, Cartman?

18:28.691 --> 18:30.985
They're going to kill me!

18:31.111 --> 18:32.195
Who's going to kill you?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.530
The antismoking people!

18:33.655 --> 18:35.198
They had me say I died
from secondhand smoke,

18:35.323 --> 18:37.492
and now they want to sacrifice
me to make it look real!

18:37.617 --> 18:38.743
They'll stop at nothing!

18:38.868 --> 18:40.078
Well, get away from us, then.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.038
Yeah, dude.
Don't get us killed, too.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.249
You guys have to help me!
- No, dude! Get away!

18:44.374 --> 18:45.917
Please, you guys!
I don't know what to do!

18:46.042 --> 18:47.502
Stop it, Cartman.
Go die on your own.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.003
If I go, you guys go!

18:49.129 --> 18:50.046
Dad!

18:50.171 --> 18:51.047
What?

18:51.172 --> 18:52.924
The antismoking people
are trying to kill Cartman,

18:53.049 --> 18:54.217
and he won't stay away from us.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.094
Don't be ridiculous, boys.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.429
The antismoking people are kind,
caring, and intelligent.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.764
Your heads
have just been corrupted

18:59.889 --> 19:02.308
by the lies
of the big tobacco companies.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.227
Hey!
Maybe that's it, you guys.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.937
Maybe the tobacco company
can help us.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.231
Help <i>you,</i>fat-ass. We weren't
in the commercial, remember?

19:08.356 --> 19:09.941
Yeah. Go to the tobacco company
yourself.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.901
That's fine! I thought
you guys were my friends!

19:12.026 --> 19:13.444
But I guess I was wrong.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.238
Yeah, dude.
You were totally wrong.

19:15.363 --> 19:16.156
Mrph rm.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.032
You guys, I am seriously
getting pissed off now!

19:18.158 --> 19:19.742
Now, come on. We're going
to the tobacco company!

19:19.868 --> 19:21.119
Oh, all right.
- No!

19:21.244 --> 19:23.496
What we really should do
is go to our parents right now

19:23.621 --> 19:25.832
and take responsibility
for smoking ourselves,

19:25.957 --> 19:27.125
even if it means
getting grounded.

19:27.250 --> 19:27.959
Why?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.544
Because if we go
to the tobacco company,

19:29.669 --> 19:31.004
I know exactly what'll happen.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.089
They'll take us in,
and then Rob Reiner will show up

19:33.214 --> 19:35.091
with all the townspeople
holding torches or something,

19:35.216 --> 19:36.926
and there'll be a big showdown
until we talk about

19:37.051 --> 19:38.803
what we learned
and change everyone's minds.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.680
This is all following a formula!

19:40.805 --> 19:44.684
So it's either deal with that
or be grounded for three weeks.

19:50.481 --> 19:51.482
God damn it.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.151
Give us the child!

19:53.276 --> 19:54.360
We will not!

19:54.485 --> 19:55.486
There!
You see that?

19:55.612 --> 19:57.822
The tobacco company
won't give us the kid!

19:57.947 --> 19:59.115
And do you know why?

19:59.240 --> 20:02.118
Because they know that
if they give us that kid,

20:02.243 --> 20:03.453
then we'll kill him --

20:03.578 --> 20:05.163
and when our commercial
goes on the air,

20:05.288 --> 20:07.165
it will lose them business!

20:10.793 --> 20:12.712
W-Wait a minute.
What?

20:12.837 --> 20:15.423
Yeah, when we kill the kid,
people are gonna think

20:15.548 --> 20:16.966
it's because of
secondhand smoke.

20:17.091 --> 20:19.093
And then these bastards
aren't gonna make money,

20:19.219 --> 20:20.678
and they know it!

20:20.803 --> 20:23.097
W-What the hell
is wrong with you?

20:23.223 --> 20:24.432
That's not right.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.310
Oh, God damn it.
Do I have to explain this again?

20:27.435 --> 20:29.354
Smoking is bad, people!

20:29.479 --> 20:32.982
So if we have to be a little
extreme to stop it, it's okay!

20:33.107 --> 20:34.734
No, it isn't, you fat turd!

20:34.859 --> 20:36.819
Because...I've learned
something today.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.071
You just hate --

20:38.196 --> 20:39.697
- See? I knew it.
- Yep.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.242
You just hate smoking, so you
use all your money and power

20:42.367 --> 20:43.826
to force others
to think like you.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.828
And that's called fascism,
you tubby asshole.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.873
God damn it!
There will be no more smoking!

20:48.998 --> 20:50.959
It wasn't the tobacco company's
fault that we smoked.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.210
It was our fault -- us.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.003
We should all take
personal responsibility

20:54.128 --> 20:56.673
instead of letting fat fascists
like him tell us what to do.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.509
You're right, boys, m'kay.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.511
Yeah!
Let smokers smoke!

21:01.636 --> 21:03.554
Yeah!
- That's right!

21:03.680 --> 21:06.683
Hey, Mr. Reiner,
why don't you "butt out"?

21:08.893 --> 21:11.646
I'm warning you -- Don't mess
with antismoking groups.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.190
I don't idolize you anymore,
asshole!

21:17.151 --> 21:19.988
My goo!
My precious goo!

21:24.158 --> 21:26.035
So, Kyle,
it wasn't the tobacco company

21:26.160 --> 21:27.287
that made you want to smoke?

21:27.412 --> 21:28.204
No.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.081
Well, then you are grounded,
mister!

21:30.206 --> 21:31.291
You too, Eric.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.251
Aw!
Aww!

21:33.376 --> 21:35.169
Well, I guess
we learned our lesson.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.714
No, we didn't, dude.
No, we didn't.
