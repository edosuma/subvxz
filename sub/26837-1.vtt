01:48.859 --> 01:49.931
Get back!

01:49.931 --> 01:50.764
Get back!

01:57.419 --> 01:58.743
I won't say it again.

01:58.743 --> 01:59.924
Move back!

01:59.924 --> 02:01.091
Come on, move!

02:13.148 --> 02:15.981
Please!

02:21.853 --> 02:23.770
Am I gonna die, Father?

02:27.802 --> 02:30.746
- Step back now!

03:30.733 --> 03:32.383
- Antaine Griffin, stop!

03:42.985 --> 03:44.794
- Antaine Griffin, stop!

03:47.182 --> 03:48.840
- Not in my church!

03:48.840 --> 03:50.734
Leave, leave now!

04:05.279 --> 04:07.279
- We'll be back for him.

04:12.476 --> 04:13.309
- Sh.

05:25.990 --> 05:27.807
- Ah, Father Eoin.

05:32.751 --> 05:35.510
I didn't know you were a
friend of Antaine Griffin.

05:35.510 --> 05:36.343
- Antaine?

05:37.339 --> 05:41.273
I haven't talked to him for a
long time, 50 years at least.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.093
- Well, he's back in
Londonderry to cause havoc.

05:50.370 --> 05:51.573
Do you want peace?

05:54.160 --> 05:56.894
- You brought guns into my church.

05:56.894 --> 05:59.603
Are you trying to tell me
that you're looking for peace?

06:03.204 --> 06:06.217
- Well, I can assure you
that's the last thing

06:07.480 --> 06:10.253
that Antaine Griffin wants is peace.

06:12.220 --> 06:14.160
You could help us to put him away.

09:02.230 --> 09:03.943
- You're misusing the pulpit.

09:06.430 --> 09:07.513
- Is that so?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.710
I thought you didn't understand Irish.

09:12.710 --> 09:15.970
- Oh, I understand all
right, but as a member

09:15.970 --> 09:19.443
of His Majesty's Constabulary,
I use the King's English.

09:59.312 --> 10:02.320
- I hope Father Eoin didn't
upset you with his sedition.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.133
- Oh, I've heard worse.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.470
- Theres' a wave of independence

10:08.470 --> 10:10.993
and so-called freedom
sweeping the country.

10:12.340 --> 10:17.113
Antaine, I believe
congratulations are in order.

10:21.010 --> 10:22.460
- The Royal College of Music.

11:06.705 --> 11:08.517
Walk on.

12:19.623 --> 12:21.750
- I don't believe the permission

12:21.750 --> 12:23.290
was sought for this gathering.

12:23.290 --> 12:25.080
Was it, Sergeant Brown?

12:25.080 --> 12:26.260
- No sir!

12:26.260 --> 12:31.050
- I'd say that this gathering
is quite possibly illegal

12:31.050 --> 12:33.283
and in breach of His Majesty's act!

12:34.920 --> 12:39.920
Sergeant, if you will,
explain DORA to these people.

12:40.750 --> 12:43.703
- The Defence of the Realm Act of 1914--

12:50.760 --> 12:53.050
- Without the expressed permission

12:53.050 --> 12:57.840
of His Majesty's Constabulary,
and any group as such

12:57.840 --> 13:02.840
is therefore an infringement
and deemed an illegal assembly.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.333
Sergeant, the act.

13:40.870 --> 13:41.803
Section 4A.

13:44.487 --> 13:47.917
"If the assembly can be defined
as a religious gathering,

13:47.917 --> 13:50.540
"then said assembly is therefore not

13:50.540 --> 13:53.231
regarded as illegal and does not fall--

13:54.151 --> 13:57.940
And does not fall under
the remit of said act.

13:57.940 --> 13:58.940
- They were dancing.

14:07.260 --> 14:08.450
- Ridiculous.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.996
Brown, release them.

14:14.996 --> 14:16.329
Come on, enough!

14:18.512 --> 14:19.345
Antaine.

14:26.205 --> 14:28.121
All right, back!

14:28.121 --> 14:33.121
- Leave the boy, Inspector.

15:10.909 --> 15:12.076
Whoa, morning.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.400
- On my way to the Donegal Sizes.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.559
- Ah.

15:19.559 --> 15:20.809
- And yourself?

15:49.626 --> 15:51.323
- Walk on.

17:30.743 --> 17:35.743
- Whoa, whoa.

21:53.081 --> 21:53.914
- Ah.

27:26.533 --> 27:27.366
Hm?

31:01.530 --> 31:02.840
- Seamus?

31:02.840 --> 31:04.223
- Inspector Joyce.

31:08.059 --> 31:08.892
- Antaine.

31:10.359 --> 31:11.192
Antaine!

32:17.282 --> 32:18.115
Antaine?

32:19.180 --> 32:20.323
Whoa, whoa.

32:37.799 --> 32:40.549
Hup!

33:41.656 --> 33:42.489
Antaine.

36:06.706 --> 36:09.705
- Peadar, nay!

36:10.805 --> 36:11.638
Peadar!

36:20.867 --> 36:21.700
Peadar!

38:55.094 --> 38:58.287
- Set the
firing range 150 yards.

38:59.292 --> 39:02.492
Five .45 round, magazine-fed.

39:02.492 --> 39:06.075
20-round mag.

39:11.838 --> 39:12.671
- Antaine.

40:56.385 --> 40:58.635
- Times are a-changing now.

51:19.114 --> 51:19.947
- Antaine.

51:55.224 --> 51:57.354
- Antaine.

52:20.323 --> 52:25.323
- Antaine?

52:30.673 --> 52:32.146
Antaine?

52:48.168 --> 52:49.001
Father?

54:39.583 --> 54:41.583
- We need four blankets.

57:38.617 --> 57:39.450
Ellie!

57:40.923 --> 57:41.756
- Ellie.

58:12.427 --> 58:17.427
- Ellie.

01:02:25.123 --> 01:02:26.706
- Mairead.

01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:35.283
- You bastard!

01:04:53.518 --> 01:04:54.435
- Feidhlim!

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.453
Feidhlim!

01:06:31.329 --> 01:06:32.162
Sit down.

01:06:39.514 --> 01:06:40.347
No!

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:50.670
- A boy not much older than
yourself shot in my church.

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:51.890
- It was one in uniform.

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:56.723
- Oh, a piece of khaki makes
him less human, does it?

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.240
Feidhlim, you didn't
shoot that boy, did you?

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.400
- No, I did not.

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:09.127
- That's it, Feidhlim.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.663
First job, you'll hide a
few bullets in your bedroom.

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:17.223
Then you start carrying an empty gun.

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:21.350
Another day, you put
the bullets in the gun

01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:24.723
and fire it, and God knows where it lands.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.440
- Those people carry bigger guns than us.

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.043
Father?

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.873
- It can't all be their fault.

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:39.753
I'm not giving you this gun.

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.220
If he wants it, he can get it himself.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.053
Tell him that.

01:10:56.445 --> 01:10:58.445
- So, he still sent you.

01:12:47.544 --> 01:12:48.794
- Drop the gun!

01:12:50.245 --> 01:12:52.287
Drop the gun now!

01:13:00.306 --> 01:13:03.424
- You're under a-fuckin'-rrest.

01:13:03.424 --> 01:13:04.507
- Arrest him!

01:14:00.058 --> 01:14:02.895
- This is for Antaine Griffin.

01:14:02.895 --> 01:14:05.418
I'd like him to have it.

01:14:05.418 --> 01:14:09.335
- Okay, thanks for what
you did for us, Father.

01:14:12.286 --> 01:14:14.369
- I didn't do it for you.

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:36.780
- No need to worry, a deal
has been done for you.

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.540
- What sort of a deal?

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.573
- Ask your priest.

01:15:45.691 --> 01:15:46.524
Come on.

01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:28.990
- He broke the bread,
gave it to His disciples

01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:33.753
and said, "Eat this, all of you.

01:16:35.747 --> 01:16:39.847
"This is my body, which
will be given up for you."

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:47.073
When supper was ended, He took the cup,

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:51.413
gave it to his disciples and said,

01:16:52.747 --> 01:16:57.107
"Take this, all of you, and drink from it.

01:16:57.107 --> 01:16:59.873
"This is the cup of my blood,

01:17:03.057 --> 01:17:06.143
"the blood of the new
and everlasting covenant.

01:17:08.192 --> 01:17:10.180
"It will be shed for you and for all

01:17:12.205 --> 01:17:14.705
"so that sins may be forgiven.

01:17:16.218 --> 01:17:18.385
"Do this in memory of me."

01:18:06.971 --> 01:18:09.054
- Father, Father, Father!
