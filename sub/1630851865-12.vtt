Tail! Tail! Paw! Paw! Purr!

00:38.000 --> 00:39.480
[laughter]

00:39.640 --> 00:42.760
Olliekins, I'm gonna miss dancing together

00:42.879 --> 00:44.120
when I'm on the Moon!

00:44.280 --> 00:46.919
I can't believe
you're travelling to outer space!

00:47.080 --> 00:50.760
You know me! I love a good adventure!

00:50.919 --> 00:53.680
Whoa-kee-dokey!
Time to inspect the rocket ship!

00:54.239 --> 00:57.480
Mmm. See you
when I'm back on Earth, kiddo!

00:58.199 --> 01:00.160
Good luck! Hmm.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.919
Was that your Auntie Char?

01:03.080 --> 01:06.080
Yep. She's going to the Moon
on a rocket ship!

01:06.200 --> 01:07.960
She's so cool.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.960
What was that dance you were doing?

01:10.119 --> 01:13.320
You saw that?
Um... it's our special dance.

01:13.479 --> 01:16.039
We've been doing it together
since I was little.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.360
Cool! But what'll happen
while she's up in space?

01:19.520 --> 01:21.640
I guess we'll both just be really sad,

01:21.800 --> 01:25.000
'cause we won't dance together
for a really long time!

01:25.160 --> 01:28.399
You know, I think I'll make her a gift
to remember me by.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.240
A gift like...
a video of your special dance?

01:32.399 --> 01:36.199
What? No! Me? Dance in a video?

01:36.320 --> 01:38.320
Yeah! Then Aunty Char could dance along

01:38.479 --> 01:40.199
whenever she gets lonely out there.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.000
It's perfect. You love it. I'll direct.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.839
Wait a second, Moon!

01:47.080 --> 01:49.199
<i>I've never danced on camera before.</i>

01:49.360 --> 01:53.839
[Moon] Oh, so it'll be your first time?
That's so exciting for you!

01:53.960 --> 01:57.479
Is it? 'Cause I was thinking
it sounded scary and...

01:57.640 --> 02:00.119
Stanley! Hair and make-up!

02:00.399 --> 02:01.479
..and really...

02:05.320 --> 02:09.120
[coughs] I could make the video
all by myself. Alone.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.840
-With nobody watching.
-Don't be silly!

02:12.000 --> 02:13.400
We'd love to help!

02:13.560 --> 02:16.880
And you're gonna need help
to get all the amazing close-ups.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.840
-Mmm-hmm.
-Close-ups?

02:22.079 --> 02:23.560
I really don't think we need...

02:23.720 --> 02:26.760
Now where should we make this video?

02:26.880 --> 02:30.160
Somewhere with great scenery...

02:30.280 --> 02:33.040
That means something
to Ollie's Auntie Char.

02:34.359 --> 02:37.040
Hmm. I'm having a brainstorm!

02:37.160 --> 02:39.440
Uh-oh. When you have a brainstorm,

02:39.600 --> 02:41.799
I always get dragged off somewhere.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.640
We'll make the video
on the beautiful beaches of Borneo!

02:45.760 --> 02:48.720
Your Auntie Char loves Borneo, right,
Ollie?

02:48.880 --> 02:51.400
-Sure. But...
-We're going to Borneo, people!

02:51.560 --> 02:53.760
But, Moon, we don't even have time!

02:53.920 --> 02:56.359
Auntie Char's rocket
launches in the morning,

02:56.519 --> 02:58.760
-and I haven't even packed!
-This is a quick trip.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.880
Your emergency
tropical-island pack will do!

03:05.160 --> 03:06.440
Come on!

03:12.760 --> 03:13.760
Whoo!

03:14.799 --> 03:16.280
Whee!

03:23.560 --> 03:28.480
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>now arriving in Borneo!</i>

03:34.119 --> 03:35.880
What a view!

03:36.040 --> 03:39.040
This is gonna look amazing on camera.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.000
Yeah, about that, Moon.
Maybe this scenery is enough.

03:43.160 --> 03:46.799
Maybe we don't need dancing
on the video. Like, at all.

03:46.959 --> 03:47.840
[nervous laugh]

03:48.200 --> 03:51.880
No dancing? And waste your talent?

03:52.000 --> 03:56.280
Trust me, Ollie.
I'm gonna make you a star!

03:57.600 --> 03:59.799
And... action!

04:00.320 --> 04:01.679
Um...

04:01.839 --> 04:03.519
Sh-sh-shake...

04:03.679 --> 04:04.760
Cut!

04:05.160 --> 04:07.480
Do you hear that clackety-clack sound?

04:07.760 --> 04:09.399
Yup. It's that orang-utan.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.399
What is he doing with those coconuts?

04:15.440 --> 04:17.560
Excuse me, Mr Orang-utan?

04:18.959 --> 04:19.959
Call me Norman!

04:20.120 --> 04:21.959
Can you please stop clacking your...

04:22.120 --> 04:25.599
Sorry, can't talk!
Too busy clacking coconuts!

04:25.719 --> 04:28.039
But we're busy trying to make a video!

04:28.200 --> 04:31.640
Can't hear you
over these super-loud coconuts!

04:31.800 --> 04:33.159
Bye-bye!

04:34.520 --> 04:37.840
Oh, well, guess we should forget
about the video, huh?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.320
No way! We just have to get closer

04:40.520 --> 04:43.000
and explain that we need him to be quiet

04:43.159 --> 04:46.599
because we're making
a video for Auntie Char! Easy!

04:48.840 --> 04:50.360
Keep it steady! I'm going in!

04:50.919 --> 04:52.520
Whoa!

04:53.479 --> 04:55.400
Whoa!

04:55.560 --> 04:57.039
Is this really a good idea?

04:57.159 --> 04:59.039
[they scream]

05:00.320 --> 05:02.159
That was kinda fun, huh?

05:02.320 --> 05:03.320
Was it?

05:03.479 --> 05:05.159
Uh... guys?

05:05.280 --> 05:06.880
Whoa!

05:07.000 --> 05:08.800
[they scream]

05:16.479 --> 05:17.560
[embarrassed laugh]

05:17.680 --> 05:19.479
Um... sorry!

05:20.320 --> 05:21.800
You hear that?

05:23.320 --> 05:25.640
Exactly! It's totally quiet.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.159
Plus,
the view's even better from up here!

05:28.320 --> 05:30.919
It's the perfect place to make our video!

05:31.039 --> 05:34.760
Auntie Char's rocket leaves soon,
so let's do this, Ollie!

05:34.880 --> 05:35.840
Shake it!

05:36.359 --> 05:38.840
<i>Ollie shakes it in Borneo, take two!</i>

05:40.200 --> 05:41.159
<i>Ahem.</i>

05:41.320 --> 05:42.640
[groans]

05:42.760 --> 05:45.560
And... action!

05:45.719 --> 05:48.240
Moon,
there's something I have to tell you.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.240
I just can't dance in front of... Aaah!

05:52.680 --> 05:54.919
-He's doing it again!
-Argh!

05:59.599 --> 06:01.280
Did you say something?

06:01.479 --> 06:04.719
Still can't hear you,
on account of the coconuts!

06:05.039 --> 06:06.560
How do we get through to him?

06:06.760 --> 06:08.479
We're gonna run out of time here.

06:08.599 --> 06:10.919
If we could just get those coconuts
away from him

06:11.080 --> 06:13.520
for one minute,
so we could ask him to be quiet.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.880
Wait. Brainstorm!

06:16.039 --> 06:17.760
I was afraid of that.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.440
Here's the plan. Lower Stanley

06:20.599 --> 06:22.840
and while he makes Norman
look that-a-way,

06:23.000 --> 06:24.280
I'll grab the coconuts!

06:32.359 --> 06:34.280
Ooh, my tummy.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.560
Shouldn't have eaten
that chili dog for lunch.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.880
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:40.799 --> 06:42.760
Aaah! A talking coconut?

06:45.359 --> 06:46.880
Stanley!

06:48.280 --> 06:49.680
[muffled] I'm OK.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.840
This has gone on long enough!
Moon, look...

06:53.000 --> 06:54.479
I'm looking, all right!

06:55.640 --> 06:57.719
That cave looks so quiet.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.320
The perfect place to shoot our video!

07:00.520 --> 07:02.719
We're moving to the cave, people!

07:04.240 --> 07:07.159
I know this cave
from Auntie Char's postcards.

07:07.320 --> 07:10.239
It's Deer Cave,
one of the biggest caves in the world.

07:10.479 --> 07:11.960
I wonder why it's called Deer Cave.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.320
I don't know, but it's perfect!

07:14.440 --> 07:18.039
Super quiet, super beautiful, and...

07:18.200 --> 07:22.440
Super dark!
Nobody will be able to see me dancing!

07:22.599 --> 07:25.159
Shake it to the right!
Shake it to the left!

07:25.280 --> 07:28.200
Not bad!
Moon, I'm so glad you forced us...

07:28.359 --> 07:31.320
er, encouraged us, to shoot here!

07:31.880 --> 07:33.440
[gasps]

07:33.599 --> 07:36.479
So that's why they call it Deer Cave!

07:36.640 --> 07:37.799
OK, Ollie!

07:37.960 --> 07:40.680
Dance just like you did
before the light came on.

07:40.799 --> 07:44.560
-And... action!
-Shake it to the right.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.479
Cut!
What's that weird knocky-knock sound?

07:48.799 --> 07:50.400
[gasps] Wait a second.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.680
Ollie's knees are all knocky,
like he's nervous.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.039
And he's making a freaked-out face,
like he's nervous.

07:57.359 --> 08:01.440
And he hasn't been able to dance,
like he's nervous.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.320
[gasps] Ollie, are you nervous?

08:04.479 --> 08:07.440
Yes! I've been trying to tell you all day!

08:07.560 --> 08:08.960
When people watch me dance,

08:09.120 --> 08:10.840
I get all nervous and can't do it!

08:11.000 --> 08:13.120
And now we're almost out of time.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.520
But don't worry! I'll think of something!

08:15.679 --> 08:17.840
Let me just... brainstorm!

08:19.039 --> 08:23.039
[distant wailing]

08:23.200 --> 08:24.200
[wailing]

08:24.359 --> 08:27.080
That doesn't sound like a brainstorm.

08:27.239 --> 08:29.200
It's coming from the beach!

08:29.919 --> 08:33.600
-Norman?
-I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?

08:33.720 --> 08:36.480
I'll try to cry more quietly!

08:36.640 --> 08:39.400
[loud sobs]

08:39.559 --> 08:41.919
-What's wrong, Norman?
-Why are you so sad?

08:42.079 --> 08:45.840
I wanted to give my amazing
Auntie Norma some coconut milk

08:46.000 --> 08:47.160
as a present.

08:47.280 --> 08:53.400
But no matter what I try,
I just can't get these coconuts open!

08:53.600 --> 08:55.520
[wailing]

08:55.680 --> 08:59.360
You've been trying to open the coconuts
this whole time?

08:59.520 --> 09:01.920
That explains everything!

09:02.079 --> 09:04.319
You're in luck, Norman. We can help you!

09:04.480 --> 09:08.520
Because I brought my...
emergency coconut opener!

09:09.840 --> 09:11.040
Here you go.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.120
Aunties are special.
I'm glad you have a gift for yours.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.920
Oh, thank you!

09:17.439 --> 09:19.199
What can I do for you?

09:19.360 --> 09:22.240
I don't think there's
anything you <i>can </i>do, Norman.

09:22.400 --> 09:26.120
I've been trying to make a video
for my auntie all day.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.560
-But it's too late.
-Yeah. Unless you can dance.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.720
You mean like...

09:33.920 --> 09:34.720
this?

09:34.839 --> 09:36.160
[gasp]

09:36.319 --> 09:38.959
Wow! You're really good!

09:42.040 --> 09:43.600
And... action!

09:45.560 --> 09:48.000
<i>Shake it to the right!</i>
<i>Shake it to the left!</i>

09:48.160 --> 09:52.199
<i>Tail! Tail! Paw! Paw! Purr!</i>

09:52.360 --> 09:55.959
-You doing OK, Ollie?
-OK? I'm great!

09:56.120 --> 09:58.680
This is just like when I dance
with my Auntie Char!

09:58.880 --> 10:01.319
Turns out all I needed
was a dance partner!
