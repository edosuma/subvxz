Professor, can you
change the station?

00:41.627 --> 00:44.182
Huh? Oh, sure. Sorry.

00:45.562 --> 00:47.081
Thanks, Professor.

00:47.116 --> 00:49.463
No, thank you, girls,
for helping me transport

00:49.497 --> 00:52.776
this dangerous vial to the
Townsville Biohazard Facility.

00:52.811 --> 00:56.056
Ooh, it would be horrible
if it fell into the wrong hands.

00:58.610 --> 01:01.992
Did somebody say,
"Wrong hands"?

01:04.961 --> 01:07.653
Give Mojo that container!

01:07.688 --> 01:10.415
You didn't say
the magic word.

01:10.449 --> 01:11.381
Huh?

01:11.416 --> 01:13.935
Aah!

01:13.970 --> 01:16.628
Hey, cool it, Mojo!

01:20.666 --> 01:24.084
Yeah, knock it off!

01:24.118 --> 01:25.844
Aaaah...

01:25.878 --> 01:27.639
Great job, girls.

01:27.673 --> 01:28.674
...Aaah!!

01:30.020 --> 01:31.021
Aah!

01:33.541 --> 01:40.134
Nooooo!

01:41.722 --> 01:43.482
Aah!

01:43.517 --> 01:45.484
Huh?

01:50.731 --> 01:51.697
Aah!

01:51.732 --> 01:52.526
Aah!

01:52.560 --> 01:53.734
Aah! Aah!

01:56.875 --> 01:58.152
Aah! Aah!

01:58.187 --> 01:59.981
Mojo's attacking!

02:00.016 --> 02:02.398
Rip his nose off!!

02:09.991 --> 02:12.201
Girls!
Girls, stop!

02:12.235 --> 02:14.341
Mojo's not doing anything
to anyone!

02:14.375 --> 02:17.723
I wish you had said that sooner.

02:17.758 --> 02:19.277
Why are we in here?

02:19.311 --> 02:24.040
Yes, Mojo demands to know
why he is in a tiny room

02:24.074 --> 02:25.835
with his tiniest
arch enemies!

02:25.869 --> 02:27.837
You're under quarantine
and can't leave this room

02:27.871 --> 02:31.289
because one of you is going to
turn into a man-eating monster.

02:31.323 --> 02:32.152
What?!

02:32.186 --> 02:33.049
What?!

02:33.083 --> 02:34.050
What?!

02:34.084 --> 02:35.500
Oh, sorry.

02:35.534 --> 02:37.364
It startles me to even say it,
too.

02:37.398 --> 02:40.505
Anyway, inside that vial
was a rare and terrible virus

02:40.539 --> 02:42.334
from the moons of Saturn.

02:42.369 --> 02:44.647
When the vial exploded,
the virus was released,

02:44.681 --> 02:46.373
and one of you
became infected.

02:46.407 --> 02:47.719
What do you mean?

02:47.753 --> 02:49.893
I'll spare you
the bone-chilling details,

02:49.928 --> 02:53.173
but at some point, one of you
will burst out of your skin

02:53.207 --> 02:55.830
and turn into
a Saturnian porcuswine.

02:55.865 --> 02:57.763
I drew this
in between panic attacks.

02:57.798 --> 03:01.388
Mojo is impressed
with your shading techniques,

03:01.422 --> 03:04.218
but finds your attempts
at perspective laughable!

03:05.771 --> 03:07.048
What do we do, Professor?

03:07.083 --> 03:08.118
Oh, don't worry.

03:08.153 --> 03:09.396
I'll be able
to reverse the effects

03:09.430 --> 03:11.674
once I give the porcuswine
the antidote.

03:11.708 --> 03:14.228
Um, isn't that
a little big to swallow?

03:14.263 --> 03:17.852
Eh, not for a porcuswine.
They can swallow an entire bus.

03:17.887 --> 03:19.751
Well, if they had buses
on Saturn,

03:19.785 --> 03:23.099
but they done support
public transportation.

03:23.133 --> 03:24.273
I'll be able to
give the antidote

03:24.307 --> 03:25.791
once the symptoms start showing,

03:25.826 --> 03:28.242
which should be anytime
in the next, uh...

03:28.277 --> 03:29.588
three years.

03:29.623 --> 03:30.900
Three years?!

03:30.934 --> 03:32.246
Three years?!

03:32.281 --> 03:34.352
Three years?!

03:34.386 --> 03:36.975
Sorry. Uh, yes, three years.

03:37.009 --> 03:39.219
But what about Mojo's podcast?

03:39.253 --> 03:41.704
He just got
his 10th subscriber!

03:41.738 --> 03:43.257
Oh.

03:43.292 --> 03:44.914
Oh, don't worry.

03:44.948 --> 03:47.710
I'm sure one of you will turn
into a bloodthirsty monster

03:47.744 --> 03:48.642
long before then.

03:48.676 --> 03:50.368
Huh?

03:50.402 --> 03:53.129
Well, have fun!

03:53.163 --> 03:58.168
So, one of us is a
bloodthirsty monster, but who?

03:58.203 --> 04:01.965
Oh, come on!
We all know who it is.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.657
I'll give you a clue.

04:03.691 --> 04:08.731
His name starts with an "M"
and ends with an "ojo Jojo."

04:08.765 --> 04:12.666
Michael Ojo Jojo?

04:12.700 --> 04:15.082
Mojo Jojo!

04:15.116 --> 04:17.601
How dare you
accuse Mojo Jojo!

04:17.636 --> 04:20.950
Mojo is at one
with his body and soul.

04:20.983 --> 04:23.815
His intuition would
certainly tell him

04:23.849 --> 04:28.095
if a porcuswine virus had taken
over his chiseled frame.

04:29.855 --> 04:32.824
Okay, let's just
calm down, everybody.

04:32.858 --> 04:36.655
Now is not the time
to make wild accusations.

04:36.690 --> 04:38.657
I agree.

04:38.692 --> 04:42.627
Mojo's the alien!!
Rip his nose off!!

04:42.661 --> 04:43.904
Aah!

04:45.526 --> 04:49.012
Everybody stop!

04:49.047 --> 04:51.325
We're going to be stuck
in here for up to three years.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.671
We can't spend
the whole time

04:52.706 --> 04:54.328
accusing each other
and fighting.

04:54.363 --> 04:57.331
Now, why don't we all
take a deep breath

04:57.366 --> 05:00.507
and play one of these board
games the Professor left us?

05:00.541 --> 05:03.441
How about
Settlers of Marshmire?

05:03.475 --> 05:05.443
It's all the fun of
growing crops and spices,

05:05.477 --> 05:07.997
but in board game form
so you don't get dirty.

05:08.031 --> 05:11.311
Maybe Blossom is the alien.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.796
She certainly
acts like one.

05:13.830 --> 05:17.696
Well, excuse me for trying
to make the most of our time.

05:17.731 --> 05:18.732
Who knows?

05:18.766 --> 05:20.389
Maybe if we're nice
to each other,

05:20.423 --> 05:23.357
whoever turns out to be the
monster will be a nice monster.

05:23.392 --> 05:24.876
Good news, girls.

05:24.910 --> 05:27.534
I just discovered
that the Saturnian porcuswine

05:27.568 --> 05:29.708
is actually
a nice monster...

05:29.743 --> 05:31.054
See?

05:31.089 --> 05:34.092
...after it's viciously devoured
any living thing nearby

05:34.126 --> 05:38.372
with its massive,
razor-sharp teeth.

05:38.407 --> 05:43.066
Okay, time to get some shut-eye.
Good night!

05:48.313 --> 05:54.492
Well, I guess we'll all just...
get in our beds and sleep.

05:54.526 --> 05:57.874
Yes...I...
guess we will.

05:57.909 --> 06:01.084
Mojo supposes
he will do the same.

06:01.119 --> 06:02.741
We will all just...

06:08.091 --> 06:10.370
Huh?

06:10.404 --> 06:11.405
Why am I...

06:11.440 --> 06:14.512
tied up?
Good question, Bubbles,

06:14.546 --> 06:17.066
or should we say,
"Porcuswine"?!

06:17.100 --> 06:19.931
Even I have to admit
you seem pretty comfortable

06:19.965 --> 06:21.691
falling asleep
so quickly.

06:21.726 --> 06:25.695
Mojo would even surmise
too comfortable for comfort.

06:25.730 --> 06:27.594
Yeah! So,
admit you're the --

06:27.628 --> 06:29.561
I'm the porcuswine!

06:29.596 --> 06:32.288
Wow. That was easier
than I thought.

06:32.322 --> 06:34.808
Yeah.
It all makes sense now.

06:34.842 --> 06:38.536
We were fighting Mojo,
and the vial fell and exploded.

06:38.570 --> 06:41.124
Then Buttercup said,
"Hey, look at me,

06:41.159 --> 06:43.955
drenched in the contents
of that dangerous vial.

06:43.989 --> 06:47.821
Something bad could
happen to me, Buttercup."

06:47.855 --> 06:52.170
What?! Ah!

06:52.204 --> 06:55.484
I guess the porcuswine
was all Bubbles all along.

06:55.518 --> 06:57.002
Lock me up!

06:57.037 --> 06:57.969
Guys?

06:58.003 --> 07:00.454
Buttercup's
the porcuswine!

07:00.489 --> 07:01.628
Wait a minute!

07:01.662 --> 07:04.147
Buttercup's the alien?!

07:04.182 --> 07:06.805
Rip Mojo's nose off!!

07:06.840 --> 07:08.358
Oh, no.

07:10.015 --> 07:12.155
Three more years of this?

07:12.190 --> 07:17.298
Everyone, good news.
Buttercup is notthe monster.

07:17.333 --> 07:20.025
Yeah!
You jerks.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.095
Oh!

07:21.130 --> 07:22.303
I ran some tests,

07:22.338 --> 07:24.098
and this sample
marked "B" for "Buttercup,"

07:24.133 --> 07:26.791
tested negative
for porcuswine DNA.

07:26.825 --> 07:29.034
Professor, all of our names
start with a "B."

07:29.069 --> 07:33.660
I know that, but in this case,
I -- uh, because, you see --

07:33.694 --> 07:36.490
Oh, dear. We're back
to square one.

07:36.525 --> 07:39.113
It still
could be any of you.

07:39.148 --> 07:41.495
Well, have fun!

07:41.530 --> 07:43.497
Ha! You heard
the Professor!

07:43.532 --> 07:44.843
Yeah, "Have fun."

07:44.878 --> 07:48.675
No, it could be anybody,
A.K.A., not me.

07:48.709 --> 07:50.504
Well, it's not me.

07:50.539 --> 07:51.609
Not me.

07:51.643 --> 07:53.334
And it's not me.

08:03.344 --> 08:06.347
They all still
suspect me, don't they?

08:06.382 --> 08:08.522
Even though it's clearly them.

08:08.557 --> 08:10.386
It's all of them
working against me,

08:10.420 --> 08:13.216
like that one time we played
Marco Polo in the pool

08:13.251 --> 08:15.874
and Blossom got out and still
kept yelling, "Polo"...

08:15.909 --> 08:17.704
...just to fool me.

08:17.738 --> 08:20.810
This is all a game
of revenge to Buttercup,

08:20.845 --> 08:22.881
but she's forgetting one thing.

08:22.916 --> 08:27.541
That Mojo knows those three
puny puffs all share a brain.

08:27.576 --> 08:31.718
They're all monsters, which only leaves one question.

08:31.752 --> 08:33.236
What if I start
spelling "Bubbles"

08:33.270 --> 08:35.238
with an "O" instead
of a "U" in the middle?

08:35.273 --> 08:38.000
Then I'd be Bobbles.

08:48.113 --> 08:50.426
Bubbles has gone mad!
Get her!

08:50.460 --> 08:53.463
No, Blossom has gone mad.
Get her!

08:53.498 --> 08:55.845
I'm mad as a cauliflower.
Get me!

08:55.880 --> 09:00.401
No! Get me!
I mean, help me!

09:00.436 --> 09:04.923
Professor,
are you okay?

09:04.958 --> 09:05.959
Aah!

09:05.993 --> 09:08.409
The Professor's
the porcuswine!

09:08.444 --> 09:09.583
We've got to help him!

09:09.618 --> 09:12.068
Help him?
Who's going to help us?!

09:13.794 --> 09:16.970
He's trying to get in!

09:19.628 --> 09:22.423
It stopped.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.494
Where
did he go?

09:24.529 --> 09:26.945
I don't see him.

09:26.980 --> 09:30.777
Maybe it got bored and went off
in search of nachos.

09:30.811 --> 09:32.606
I know that's
what I would do.

09:32.641 --> 09:34.815
Girls, look!
It's the antidote.

09:34.850 --> 09:36.403
Someone is going
to have to go get it.

09:36.437 --> 09:38.474
Yes, but who?

09:38.508 --> 09:40.925
Hmm.

09:40.959 --> 09:43.134
Oh.

09:50.175 --> 09:52.799
There! Mojo has
gotten the antidote.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.146
Now, what's the plan?

09:58.874 --> 10:00.530
Aah!

10:00.565 --> 10:03.292
Help Mojo!

10:03.326 --> 10:06.467
Save Mojo!

10:06.502 --> 10:10.195
Mojo needs
your help! Aah!

10:10.230 --> 10:12.646
Come on, girls.
We've got to get that antidote.

10:14.199 --> 10:15.822
Aah!

10:15.856 --> 10:18.652
Oh, Mojo.

10:18.687 --> 10:22.173
Hey, ugly!
You hungry?

10:22.207 --> 10:24.485
Hah!

10:24.520 --> 10:28.558
Hey, pig face!
Over here.

10:28.593 --> 10:30.664
Here, piggy,
piggy, piggy!

10:32.355 --> 10:33.667
Aah!

10:33.702 --> 10:37.015
And it is time
for Mojo to go-jo.

10:37.050 --> 10:39.224
Ugh!
What the...?

10:46.059 --> 10:47.198
Oh.

10:47.232 --> 10:49.649
Professor!

10:49.683 --> 10:51.685
We're so glad
you're okay.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.722
Oh, thank you,
girls.

10:53.756 --> 10:55.827
That was
truly scary.

10:55.862 --> 10:59.003
Well, it's all okay now,
and everyone's safe.

10:59.037 --> 11:01.937
Uh, excuse me.
A little help here.
