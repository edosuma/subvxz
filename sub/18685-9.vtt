WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.736
MAN: Call in an airstrike!
(gunfire, explosions
on video game)

00:02.770 --> 00:05.373
MAN 2: Suppression fire!
Get down! Get down!

00:05.406 --> 00:07.741
You think you can
hide in a hospital?

00:07.775 --> 00:09.143
(door opens)
Think again.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.544
(explosion, men screaming)

00:10.578 --> 00:11.879
ANDREW:
Damn.

00:11.912 --> 00:14.415
You're ruthless.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.217
Wha...?

00:16.250 --> 00:17.818
Is that a...

00:17.851 --> 00:19.587
Whose burrito
did I just step in?

00:19.620 --> 00:20.754
I don't know.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.090
(groans)
God.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.258
Guys, this place
is getting out of hand.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.826
I love it.
You can do anything here.

00:25.859 --> 00:26.827
(spits)

00:26.860 --> 00:28.162
Who the hell's this kid?

00:28.196 --> 00:30.198
I'm Andrew.
We met a bunch of times.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.999
Okay. Enough is enough.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.934
We got strange kids
milling about.

00:33.967 --> 00:37.505
Full burritos just laying
around, totally unaccounted for.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.506
That's on Alba.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.707
Just because Alba's Mexican

00:39.740 --> 00:41.109
does not mean she's responsible

00:41.142 --> 00:43.111
for every burrito
that goes missing.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.445
Alba's Guatemalan.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.914
Exactly! Alba's Guatemalan.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.282
I'm not talking about
the burrito, I'm talking about

00:48.316 --> 00:50.118
the fact
that she doesn't do her job.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.352
It doesn't work
like that anymore.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.020
We all need to clean up
after ourselves.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.188
(cap clatters)
Oh, we do?

00:54.222 --> 00:55.556
These aren't my
half-empty beers.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.925
And I will dispose of them
when I am finished with them.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.460
Now get out of here,
the TV's mine.

00:59.493 --> 01:00.928
I recorded the game.
What?

01:00.961 --> 01:03.231
It's not even live?
Screw that.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.365
Let's do this.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.933
I've been dodging
the score all day.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.035
MICKEY: I'm just trying
to find my lucky shirt.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.937
Why do you need the lucky shirt
if the game's already over?

01:09.970 --> 01:11.305
SABRINA:
Hey, check me out.

01:11.339 --> 01:13.241
Do I look like a trashy whore
or what?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.743
(gasps)
What'd you do to my shirt?

01:15.776 --> 01:17.044
I made it sexy.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.412
Sabrina, how would you feel
if I just ran around

01:18.446 --> 01:19.780
stealing your clothes?

01:19.813 --> 01:21.882
You can't fit in my clothes.
Ugh!

01:21.915 --> 01:23.717
It's for the Maloney's
white trash party, okay?

01:23.751 --> 01:25.719
It's the biggest
party of the year.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.321
Yeah, okay.
Well, in that case.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.756
CHIP: It's gonna be awesome.
The youngest one, Danny,

01:28.789 --> 01:31.058
is in my grade,
so I get to go this year.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.161
I heard their sister's
bringing a bunch of her friends

01:33.194 --> 01:34.728
from St. Margaret's.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.063
Oh, yeah. The place
is gonna be running wild

01:36.096 --> 01:37.898
with repressed
Catholic school girls.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.233
Don't pretend
that doesn't terrify you.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.335
Ah, high school's
the best.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.070
Parties suck when you get older.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.174
No one fights or humps
or breaks anything.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.408
Everyone leave.
Get out of here,

01:47.441 --> 01:50.578
so we can watch
the game in peace. Go!

01:50.611 --> 01:52.513
Sabrina, will you switch
the input for me?

01:52.546 --> 01:53.747
Ha! Yeah, that's funny.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.983
Uh... Chip? Can you
help me out, please?

01:56.016 --> 01:57.818
Yeah, right.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.753
Ben, go click the input switch
for me, please.

01:59.787 --> 02:00.921
You're just sitting there.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.089
You do it.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.024
(laughter)
Oh!

02:05.826 --> 02:08.095
Boston bullpen blows it again.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.130
Another win for Toronto.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.366
That's it! I'm done!

02:12.400 --> 02:14.134
I'm done
with these losers!

02:15.736 --> 02:17.838
Were you not disgusted
by that loss?

02:17.871 --> 02:19.607
What? Yeah. Yeah. They suck.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.476
I-I just can't stop thinking
about Ben right now. I...

02:22.510 --> 02:24.545
I mean, he's never talked to me
like that before.

02:24.578 --> 02:25.613
(laughs)

02:25.646 --> 02:27.548
And so it begins.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.782
So what begins?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.818
Oh, the transformation.

02:30.851 --> 02:31.952
Oh, yeah.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.021
I see it in Chip and Sabrina.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.889
One day, sweet little angels,

02:35.923 --> 02:38.326
and the next,
vile, wretched creatures

02:38.359 --> 02:40.194
with no respect for nobody.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.829
No, I can't afford to lose Ben.

02:41.862 --> 02:42.996
He's all I've got now.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.665
I'm hanging on by
a thread as is.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.133
Well then, you need
to start punishing him

02:46.166 --> 02:47.868
like his parents never did.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.404
Absolutely not, Alba.
I don't punish.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.873
Yeah. I never grew up
with rules or discipline.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.576
I turned out pretty great.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.478
No, you know what?
I, we're just overthinking it.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.347
We're overthinking it.
Ben's a good kid.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.948
I just got to go clear the air.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.588
Hey, buddy.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.590
What are you doing?
Playing with your ant farm?

03:09.623 --> 03:11.259
Yeah. Billy and Greg
are wrestling,

03:11.292 --> 03:13.160
so I had to separate 'em.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.528
Again? Oh, man.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.896
Those guys.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.899
You know, this whole house
is kind of like an ant farm.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.067
Really?

03:20.100 --> 03:22.069
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You see, see this ant

03:22.102 --> 03:23.704
in the middle, right here?

03:23.737 --> 03:25.239
The, the really
cute one?

03:25.273 --> 03:27.441
Uh, she's kind and fair. That's
the queen. That's like me.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.943
And all these ants around on
the side, those are worker ants.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.012
That's like you
and Chip and Sabrina.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.881
Do I have to build tunnels
for you?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.416
Yeah.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.084
Yeah, I mean, if I asked
you to, you would.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.420
See, 'cause
without the queen ant,

03:39.453 --> 03:41.522
all the other ants would just be
running around like kooks.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.023
Nothing would get done.
It'd be crazy.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.625
It'd be chaos,
you know?

03:44.658 --> 03:47.628
You don't want that. So if I ask
you to do something around here,

03:47.661 --> 03:51.265
I need you to perk your little,
uh, ant antenna up, right,

03:51.299 --> 03:52.733
and-and do it.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.635
Ben. We need you.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.036
Well, h-hold on.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.538
We... I have him right now.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.039
So give us a second.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.908
Uh, yeah. No can do.
We need him now.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.075
Well, you don't get him now.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.444
What's wrong with you?

04:03.477 --> 04:05.379
We need to get Mom's box
of poor stuff for the party,

04:05.413 --> 04:07.080
and he's the only one
who can fit in the attic.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.483
Okay. Well, hang on a minute
until he's done.

04:09.517 --> 04:10.984
Let's let him
decide for himself.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.820
Hey, Ben? Buddy?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.355
What do you want to do?

04:18.526 --> 04:21.829
Oh... Don't forget,
who's your best buddy?

04:21.862 --> 04:22.830
You.
Yeah.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.465
But who's your big sister?
You.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.434
You're either with us
or you're against us.

04:26.467 --> 04:30.070
Yeah, but remember, good
little ants, they get rewarded.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.905
And bad little ants,
they get squished.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.140
SABRINA: Hey, Ben.
Be smart, buddy.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.509
You don't want to end up
like our last little brother.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.511
You had another brother?

04:37.545 --> 04:40.681
Yeah. We had to kill him,
'cause he wasn't a team player.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.015
Okay. Get out of here.
Li... Don't listen to them.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.250
They're messing with you.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.752
Oh, I wish we were,
but we wouldn't lie

04:44.785 --> 04:46.153
about something like that.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.588
Okay. Well, if you had
another little brother,

04:47.621 --> 04:50.090
then what was his name, on the
count of three? One, two, three.

04:50.123 --> 04:50.858
Elliott.
Elliott.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.163
Mm.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.264
Sorry, Mickey.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.532
Oh...

04:58.566 --> 05:00.801
Bye, Mickey!
Come on, Ben.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.441
I don't know. I just, I
don't know what to do, Alba.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.443
I can feel Ben slipping away.

05:09.477 --> 05:12.279
I am telling you,
drop the hammer.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.181
Otherwise, he will never learn.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.949
You realize
that is asking me to betray

05:15.983 --> 05:17.685
everything that I stand for.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.987
(footsteps approaching)

05:20.020 --> 05:22.456
(clears throat)

05:22.490 --> 05:23.724
Where do you think you're going?

05:23.757 --> 05:25.192
School.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.994
No, I don't think so.
(laughing): No.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.462
Not today.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.130
I'm punishing you.

05:30.163 --> 05:30.898
For what?

05:32.032 --> 05:33.467
For...

05:33.501 --> 05:35.903
being... for being dicks.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.037
Mm.
That's what's for.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.739
You guys need to learn
to respect me.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.474
Why?
Because I said so.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.642
That's why.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.844
I'd rather not.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.145
Hey.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.213
I am dead serious.

05:46.246 --> 05:48.315
You are not going
to school today,

05:48.348 --> 05:49.583
so help me God.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.852
Sweet.
No school.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.120
(backpacks drop on floor)

05:55.222 --> 05:56.524
Oh, that's...

05:56.557 --> 05:58.225
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.327
But, you know,

06:00.360 --> 06:02.763
don't think that you
just get to sit around

06:02.796 --> 06:04.331
and do whatever
you want all day.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.666
That's not what I meant.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.668
(cartoons playing on TV)
No, I meant, you guys...

06:07.701 --> 06:09.437
you're grounded.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.337
(both chuckle)

06:10.370 --> 06:11.672
Am I grounded, too?

06:11.705 --> 06:14.207
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No more special
treatment for you, buddy.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.043
Don't worry, Ben. She
has no power over us.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.512
Oh, I don't?

06:18.546 --> 06:21.048
(TV continues playing)

06:21.081 --> 06:22.215
(turns off TV)

06:22.249 --> 06:23.717
No more TV.
ALBA: Ooh.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.886
Oh-ho.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.590
Well, okay.
(sighs)

06:29.623 --> 06:31.224
Come on, give me those.
No.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.960
Give me...
(grunts)

06:32.993 --> 06:36.263
Then I will smash
your video games into oblivion.

06:36.296 --> 06:37.230
I'll buy more.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.532
SABRINA:
Face it, Mackenzie.

06:38.566 --> 06:39.967
You've got no leverage.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.535
Oh, yeah?

06:41.569 --> 06:43.036
How about this?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.473
Not one of you steps foot
outside of this house

06:45.506 --> 06:47.441
until the entire thing is clean.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.909
(laughs)
Yeah? Good luck with that.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.144
Yeah, if you don't like it,
why don't you clean it yourself?

06:52.580 --> 06:53.814
MICKEY:
You know what?

06:53.847 --> 06:55.916
Fine with me.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.084
Cool.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.385
I grew up in squalor.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.253
I am perfectly
comfortable in it.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.755
You guys want to
live like this?

07:01.789 --> 07:03.791
I think it's a great idea.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.259
Oh, yeah. Hi.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.261
In fact,
who's this pretty lady, huh?

07:08.295 --> 07:09.429
Oh...

07:09.463 --> 07:10.864
This important to anyone?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.467
Huh?

07:13.501 --> 07:15.102
How's that?

07:15.135 --> 07:16.570
That messy enough for you?

07:16.604 --> 07:18.672
You guys like
any of this stuff?

07:18.706 --> 07:20.541
(Mickey laughing)

07:21.975 --> 07:24.244
Oh, Alba. That feels good.
Yeah?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.779
You're gonna want
to get in on this.
All right.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.117
(yells)

07:30.150 --> 07:31.284
(Mickey moans)

07:31.318 --> 07:34.354
(Mickey and Alba shouting,
things crashing)

07:35.956 --> 07:38.325
(screaming)

07:38.358 --> 07:41.962
(screaming)
Oh! Ow! Get
it! Get it!

07:41.995 --> 07:44.131
Yeah!
Yeah!

07:44.164 --> 07:46.233
(Mickey and Alba panting)
ALBA: Yeah.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.639
(phones clicking)

07:51.672 --> 07:52.973
(Jimmy chuckles)

07:53.006 --> 07:55.609
Whoa.
(chuckles)

07:55.643 --> 07:58.512
Yeah. What happened here?

07:58.546 --> 07:59.613
Mickey punished us.

07:59.647 --> 08:00.881
Yeah. She really
showed us who's boss.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.650
(Chip and Sabrina laugh)

08:02.683 --> 08:05.152
(Mickey laughs mockingly)

08:05.185 --> 08:07.187
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.122
We're all having fun.
That's so great.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.825
Hey. You guys got a quick
sec to talk leverage?

08:11.859 --> 08:14.061
(phone beeps, line ringing)

08:14.094 --> 08:15.328
MAN:
Hello?

08:15.362 --> 08:17.965
Oh, hello. May I speak
with Mrs. Maloney please?

08:17.998 --> 08:18.832
Just a sec.

08:18.866 --> 08:19.900
What are you doing?

08:19.933 --> 08:21.234
Oh, I'm shutting
down the party.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.303
Oh. Everybody's
gonna be so mad
(chuckles)

08:23.336 --> 08:24.471
at you guys, huh?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.839
Have you completely lost it?

08:25.873 --> 08:27.808
Nah. She's bluffing.
Am I?

08:27.841 --> 08:28.976
JIMMY: Okay, you know what?
Hey, hey.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.644
Mick. Don't be unreasonable.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.646
All right? Let's just talk
about this. We're all here.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.647
MICKEY:
Hey, hey, hey!

08:33.681 --> 08:35.482
Look, I don't want
to be this person.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.349
Hang up the phone.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.551
You know? I-I'm not
a party stopper.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.352
I'm a party starter.
Yeah, she starts them.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.354
Hang up the phone!
You don't tell me what to do!

08:41.388 --> 08:42.389
Hang up the phone!

08:42.422 --> 08:43.991
Clean up the mess!
Oh, whoa!

08:44.024 --> 08:45.659
Whoa!

08:45.693 --> 08:48.762
Geez, let's put the claws away,
all right?

08:48.796 --> 08:50.497
Okay? Here, here,
here, here.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.865
How about this?

08:51.899 --> 08:53.734
Jimmy cleans up.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.903
No, thanks.
Okay? No. It's all
right. I enjoy it.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.237
It's not okay with me, though.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.572
No, it's fine though.
No, thank you, Jimmy.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.074
I enjoy doing it.
Put it down!

09:01.108 --> 09:02.676
MRS. MALONEY:
Hello?

09:02.710 --> 09:04.912
Hi there.
Hi.
Mrs. Maloney.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.013
My name...
Fine!

09:06.046 --> 09:06.847
Hello?
Fine what?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.115
We'll clean!
Who is this?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.050
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

09:10.083 --> 09:11.418
(Mickey and Alba laugh)

09:12.720 --> 09:13.687
That was cutting it close.
Yeah.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.922
Very exciting.
Thank you for that.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.089
Okay, awesome.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.791
Let me tell you how
this is gonna go down.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.260
Alba and I, we're gonna run
out for a quick beer or six,

09:20.293 --> 09:22.562
and we will be back in...
what do you think, two hours?

09:22.596 --> 09:23.764
Make it three.
Three.

09:23.797 --> 09:24.865
You heard the lady.
Make it three.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.033
We'll be back
in three hours.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.200
Gives you plenty of time
to clean up.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.902
Oh, and in the meantime,
can you guys move

09:28.936 --> 09:30.771
that big TV upstairs to my room?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.706
I recorded the game,
and I kind of want to watch it

09:32.740 --> 09:34.574
all cozy in my bed.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.309
I... Should I
come with you?

09:36.343 --> 09:39.613
No, 'cause you love
to clean so much, remember?

09:39.647 --> 09:41.248
Yeah, I could get
used to this.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.950
Oh, yeah, nice.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.118
That's what
I'm talking about.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.387
I like it. Yeah, what
do you think, Alba?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.623
It's okay. You know,
it's not like when I do it,

09:49.657 --> 09:51.424
Well, yeah.
but it's okay. Yeah.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.592
Ooh, ooh. Uh-oh.
Ooh.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.761
Bad news, though.
Uh-oh.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.896
Bad news flying in, see...

09:55.929 --> 09:58.431
I'm seeing a big old smudge
print right here.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.633
You seeing that, Alba?

09:59.667 --> 10:00.834
Yeah, sloppy work.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.269
Yeah. Well, why don't you go

10:02.302 --> 10:04.237
pop a quick scrub
on that, Cinderella,

10:04.271 --> 10:06.740
and then we'll be in business.
Nice work!

10:06.774 --> 10:07.808
Yeah!
Nice.

10:07.841 --> 10:08.842
I like it.
Yeah.

10:08.876 --> 10:09.843
Guys.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.011
Super impressed.
Think you made

10:11.044 --> 10:12.579
very good decisions
here tonight.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.115
You know what? You want to...
You want to go watch the game?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.850
Good.
Let's go... We're
gonna watch the game.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.919
You guys have a great night.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.420
Um, I hope you're not
too scrubbed out.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.122
(both laughing)

10:25.693 --> 10:28.295
(both continue laughing)

10:28.328 --> 10:30.463
You know, it was just basic
dog psychology.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.165
Sometimes you gotta...

10:32.199 --> 10:33.366
Wh-what is this?

10:33.400 --> 10:34.501
What the hell?

10:34.534 --> 10:35.936
(door closes, locks)
Whoa.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.104
(gasps)

10:37.137 --> 10:39.506
(shrieks) No!
(screaming):
No!

10:39.539 --> 10:40.774
We're trapped!

10:40.808 --> 10:42.142
Hey! You let us out!

10:42.175 --> 10:43.476
SABRINA:
Sorry, we got to run.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.612
We have a party to get to.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.448
Oh! You better hope I
never get out of this room!

10:48.481 --> 10:49.783
CHIP:
Oh, I almost forgot.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.484
Ben has something
he wants to tell you.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.686
Go ahead, Ben. Say the thing.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.822
BEN:
Sox lost, three to zero!

10:54.855 --> 10:56.957
(both scream)

10:56.990 --> 10:58.225
I'm gonna kill you!

10:58.258 --> 11:00.060
(horn honking)

11:00.093 --> 11:02.229
Jimmy!

11:02.262 --> 11:03.530
Don't you dare!

11:03.563 --> 11:04.698
Sorry, Mick.
(whoops)

11:04.732 --> 11:06.066
Party of the year.
What?!

11:06.099 --> 11:07.400
No!
SABRINA:
Bye, Mick!

11:07.434 --> 11:09.169
BEN:
Bye!

11:09.202 --> 11:10.637
(screams)

11:10.670 --> 11:13.140
Aunt Mickey's scaring me.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.342
Ah, don't worry. She can't hurt
you from up there, little buddy.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.910
(loud thud)
(screaming)

11:18.678 --> 11:21.514
(screaming continues)

11:21.548 --> 11:23.116
(tires screeching)

11:24.417 --> 11:27.320
(groaning)

11:27.354 --> 11:29.256
Oh.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.660
(gasps)
CHIP: She's invincible.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.263
All right. She'll
be all right.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.833
You guys still
want to party? Oh.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.535
Yeah. Oh.
(groans)

11:42.569 --> 11:43.871
All right.
Some radio?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.510
* This is for
my future baby mama *

11:50.543 --> 11:52.379
* Hope your skin
is black as midnight *

11:52.412 --> 11:53.747
* I'll take you out that Honda

11:53.781 --> 11:55.082
* I can put you in a Benz

11:55.115 --> 11:56.583
* I can balance out
your chakras *

11:56.616 --> 11:58.085
* Fornication is a sin

11:58.118 --> 11:59.419
* We can ... all night
regardless *

11:59.452 --> 12:00.687
* Our father art in heaven...

12:00.720 --> 12:02.022
(laughing):
Oh, my gosh.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.523
You guys are fun.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.792
Thanks.
It's our first party.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.459
Shut up, Andrew.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.727
Oh, that's so cute.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.029
Wait, what grade
are you guys in?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.964
Eighth.
Wow, really?

12:10.998 --> 12:13.033
You just...
you seem so much older.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.267
I get that a lot.
(laughs)

12:14.301 --> 12:15.402
I was held back
in kindergarten

12:15.435 --> 12:17.237
because my body
developed slow.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.272
(laughs)
Okay, I cannot handle

12:19.306 --> 12:20.874
how funny you guys are.

12:20.908 --> 12:21.975
Um... you know,

12:22.009 --> 12:23.076
you guys want to to go somewhere

12:23.110 --> 12:24.244
a little more quiet,

12:24.277 --> 12:26.146
just so that we can
kind of talk?

12:26.179 --> 12:28.248
Him or me?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.883
Why not both?

12:29.917 --> 12:32.485
Can you give us
a second, please?

12:36.189 --> 12:37.925
Holy crap, is
this happening?

12:37.958 --> 12:39.927
I can't believe it.
What do we do?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.262
I-I feel like we have
to say yes, right?

12:42.295 --> 12:44.397
Definitely. I think I love her.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.134
No... okay, let's just set
some ground rules,

12:47.167 --> 12:48.401
make sure things
don't get weird.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.803
Okay, good idea.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.771
Like you and I shouldn't kiss
for more than five seconds.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.907
Kiss who?

12:53.941 --> 12:54.908
Each other.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.776
We're not kissing at all.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.445
What if it's a deal breaker
for her?

12:58.478 --> 12:59.679
Then we break the deal.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.614
All right, fine, geez,
we won't kiss.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.651
Didn't know you were gonna
be so weird about it.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.920
Guys. Is everything okay?

13:06.954 --> 13:08.088
Everything is great.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.091
Yeah. Let's do this.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.759
*

13:12.792 --> 13:14.962
(hushed murmuring)

13:14.995 --> 13:16.529
Sick costume.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.166
Five bucks.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.534
*

13:21.568 --> 13:23.036
(grunts)

13:23.070 --> 13:25.038
(party chatter, laughter)

13:25.072 --> 13:27.107
*

13:27.140 --> 13:29.042
You go that way,
I'll go this way.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.312
* Boy, I'm buoyant, we are

13:32.345 --> 13:34.114
* Floating on them peons

13:34.147 --> 13:35.615
* Go in till they take my
bro'nem out them CDCRs... *

13:35.648 --> 13:37.284
(shouts, laughs)

13:37.317 --> 13:39.319
Suck on that, losers!

13:39.352 --> 13:40.954
Oh!

13:40.988 --> 13:42.622
(glass breaks)
(crowd gasps)

13:42.655 --> 13:45.458
(screams)

13:45.492 --> 13:47.460
JIMMY:
What's the matter with you?
Where are they?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.296
Look what you did to my hands!

13:49.329 --> 13:50.630
(Jimmy groans)

13:50.663 --> 13:51.798
(screams)

13:51.831 --> 13:53.233
JIMMY:
I don't know.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.968
I don't know.
They're around here somewhere.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.369
I swear to God, I don't know.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.838
(groans):
Please.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.240
(whimpering gasp)

14:00.273 --> 14:03.176
You frickin' psycho!

14:03.210 --> 14:04.811
*

14:04.844 --> 14:06.113
Ben!

14:08.515 --> 14:11.418
Ben! Chip!

14:11.451 --> 14:13.820
Sabrina, are you...?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.155
Uh...
(bong bubbling)

14:15.188 --> 14:17.657
I'm sorry.
It's the wrong room. I...

14:17.690 --> 14:19.492
(coughs)

14:19.526 --> 14:21.528
Uh...

14:21.561 --> 14:23.330
* Are you in the city?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.398
* Are you on the other side?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.400
* Are you in the city?

14:27.434 --> 14:29.336
* Are you on the other side?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.171
* Are you in the city?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.340
* Are you on the other side?

14:33.373 --> 14:34.574
* Are you in the city?

14:34.607 --> 14:37.010
* Are you on the other side?

14:37.044 --> 14:38.611
*

14:38.645 --> 14:40.380
I'm starting to prune up.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.514
Where the hell is she?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.350
It doesn't take this long
to get beers.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.785
Do you think we need
more bubbles?

14:45.818 --> 14:48.621
No, we're good on bubbles.
Just stop talking about bubbles.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.028
I-It's not what
it looks like.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.229
Get out.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.131
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:10.677 --> 15:14.814
Hey. Um... where did Chip go?

15:14.847 --> 15:18.385
Uh... he had to step out,

15:18.418 --> 15:20.653
but... I'm here.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.322
We got plenty of bubbles.

15:29.029 --> 15:32.799
* In the jungle,
the mighty jungle *
* A-weema-weh, a-weema-weh *

15:32.832 --> 15:36.603
* The lion sleeps tonight
* A-weema-weh, a-weema-weh *

15:36.636 --> 15:40.407
* A-wee... ee-ee-ee-ee

15:40.440 --> 15:44.177
* Ee-a-bumba-weh

15:44.211 --> 15:48.248
* A-wee... ee-ee-ee-ee

15:48.281 --> 15:50.583
* Ee-a-bumba-weh

15:50.617 --> 15:52.585
(loud party chatter)

15:52.619 --> 15:54.521
*

16:02.295 --> 16:04.998
Can I borrow this?
Thank you.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.470
No. No way.
(gags)

16:14.241 --> 16:16.309
Are you insane?!
Where's Ben?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.711
He's over there.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.547
(crowd cheering)

16:22.982 --> 16:24.951
Ben. Get down. We're going home.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.219
But I'm having fun.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.787
Tough crap. We're leaving.
Let's go.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.289
No, I don't want to.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.392
Ben, get off the table
right now!

16:32.425 --> 16:33.960
Screw you!

16:33.993 --> 16:35.228
(crowd gasps)

16:35.262 --> 16:36.563
(crowd laughs)

16:40.900 --> 16:43.403
(crowd gasping)

16:43.436 --> 16:45.338
(crowd quiets)

16:46.939 --> 16:48.875
*

16:51.511 --> 16:52.912
Uh...

16:59.586 --> 17:00.653
(low conversations)

17:00.687 --> 17:02.522
Well, it's on...

17:05.692 --> 17:08.395
Alba and Jimmy,
can I talk to the kids alone

17:08.428 --> 17:09.696
for a minute, please?

17:09.729 --> 17:13.266
I go do things
in the kitchen.

17:13.300 --> 17:17.437
Yeah, I'll, uh,
give you a hand.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.779
(groans)
Hey.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.349
So...

17:29.382 --> 17:32.952
things got... pretty crazy
last night, right?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.390
I mean, come on, you guys
gonna ice me out all day long?

17:38.925 --> 17:41.194
Look, I admit it,
I may have gone too far.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.530
"May have"?!
You publicly flogged Ben.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.631
Yeah, I said I was sorry.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.266
No, you didn't.
Well, I'm saying it now.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.367
Are you?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.035
Yeah. Are you?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.537
What would we be sorry about?

17:50.570 --> 17:52.739
I don't know,
destroying my room,

17:52.772 --> 17:54.541
telling me to
screw myself,

17:54.574 --> 17:55.975
turning my face into a lasagna.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.044
N-No? Nothing?
No remorse at all?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.446
No thanks.
We're good.
No.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.951
Huh.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.654
Okay.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.557
Well, guess what, I am sorry,

18:10.590 --> 18:13.560
and I would like
to fix this with you guys,

18:13.593 --> 18:17.330
so can I please
take you out to dinner?

18:19.299 --> 18:20.767
What do you say, Ben?

18:22.602 --> 18:25.405
Can you please help me out here?
You really want him to hate me?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.973
I'm doing what I can.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.344
Guess I could go for a bite.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.448
What do you say, Ben?

18:36.983 --> 18:39.452
Can I get French fries?

18:41.288 --> 18:44.757
(weather forecast plays
on radio)

18:44.791 --> 18:47.927
Aunt Mickey,
I'm hungry.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.296
Yeah, where the hell
are you taking us?

18:49.329 --> 18:51.998
It's a surprise.
You'll see.

18:56.969 --> 19:01.841
Okay. We're here.
Hop out.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.109
BEN:
There's no restaurant
out here.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.277
CHIP:
Where the hell are we?

19:04.311 --> 19:07.180
I knew we should've ordered in.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.048
BEN:
I thought I was getting
French fries.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.049
Ever heard of GPS, Mickey?

19:10.082 --> 19:11.117
Are we hunting
for our food?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.118
Yeah, where the hell are we?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.119
I don't get any
service out here.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.287
I'm gonna take
that and that.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.655
SABRINA:
What the hell?
Thank you very much.

19:15.688 --> 19:16.623
See you guys at home.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.991
What, you're just gonna
leave us out here?

19:19.025 --> 19:23.530
Listen... I know you guys didn't
ask to be in this situation,

19:23.563 --> 19:26.799
and I am so sorry that
your parents aren't here,

19:26.833 --> 19:28.468
but I am.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.137
You know? And I'm doing
the best that I can.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.140
And if you decide that
you don't want me around,

19:34.173 --> 19:36.309
please, just tell me
and I will go,

19:36.343 --> 19:38.378
but if you decide
you want me to stay,

19:38.411 --> 19:40.980
you've got to recognize the fact
that I need to be in charge.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.849
That is the only way
this is gonna work.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.819
And fortunately,
you've got the entire walk home

19:46.853 --> 19:48.421
to figure out
what you want to do.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.667
She really left us?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.102
Not a chance.
She's bluffing.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.175
SABRINA:
See? Told you.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.911
Mm, what a loser.
All bark, no bite.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.816
Aah!

20:18.551 --> 20:20.019
(gasps)

20:20.052 --> 20:21.421
(coughs)

20:21.454 --> 20:23.390
(birds chirping)

20:28.060 --> 20:30.096
(door opens)

20:58.257 --> 21:00.660
(clears throat)

21:03.663 --> 21:05.665
(exhales heavily)
