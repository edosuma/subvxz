WEBVTT

01:03.324 --> 01:04.629
It'’s them!

01:06.631 --> 01:08.155
Get ready.

01:08.981 --> 01:11.071
Two more prisoners
coming in!

01:12.202 --> 01:14.204
Prepare for docking!

01:15.466 --> 01:16.859
In position!

01:18.948 --> 01:20.210
Easy!

01:28.871 --> 01:30.742
Gate secure!

01:49.283 --> 01:51.154
Prisoner walking!

02:17.572 --> 02:19.965
Oh, great.
Another cellmate.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.533
No offense, pal.
You seem lovely.

02:23.969 --> 02:26.668
Uh...
Let'’s show you around.
Get you situated here.

02:26.842 --> 02:31.238
This is the bucket where
our pee freezes. And, um...

02:32.064 --> 02:32.978
Yeah, that'’s it.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.850
What'’s your name, lass?

02:35.024 --> 02:37.679
Uh, That'’s Holga.
I'’m Edgin. And you are?

02:37.853 --> 02:42.640
I'’ve been in a lot of cells.
Never shared one with a female.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.120
Think I'’m gonna like it.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.296
Word of advice,

02:46.470 --> 02:48.820
Holga doesn'’t love
to be disturbed while
she'’s eating her potatoes.

02:48.994 --> 02:51.519
Kind of the highlight
of her day.Shut up, you!

02:52.302 --> 02:53.651
Sure thing. Have at it.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.350
Little shy, eh?

02:56.524 --> 02:59.701
I'’m not so bad once
you get to know me.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.137
Mmm.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.574
Don'’t be like that.

03:04.445 --> 03:07.012
We could be very happy to--

03:13.367 --> 03:16.370
I think I'’m gonna
do this without fingers
and make it a mitten.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.807
Who am I trying to impress?

03:20.156 --> 03:23.028
♪ Not fortune found
Nor fate divine♪

03:23.203 --> 03:26.597
♪ Come close to toping
The juice of the vine♪

03:26.771 --> 03:28.947
♪ With cherry crew
We sip and sway♪

03:29.121 --> 03:31.559
♪ Let'’s tip the tankard
And waste the day♪

03:31.733 --> 03:33.735
Oi! Stop that singing!

03:34.475 --> 03:35.911
You got it, Tobias.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.436
The Absolution Council
is tomorrow.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.786
Don'’t get
your hopes up, Ed.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.614
What are you talking about?

03:43.788 --> 03:46.661
Jarnathan is on the council
this time. He'’s an Aarakocra.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.750
If anyone'’s gonna free us,
it'’s him.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.404
Not gonna happen.

03:50.578 --> 03:54.364
I tell you, Holga, this is
your last day chopping ice.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.762
By authority
of the Lords'’ Alliance,

04:00.936 --> 04:04.505
this Absolution Council
will now come to order

04:04.679 --> 04:09.684
in the case of Edgin Darvis
and Holga Kilgore.

04:10.946 --> 04:14.254
This is the second year of
incarceration for the crimes

04:14.428 --> 04:17.866
of grand larceny
and skullduggery.

04:18.040 --> 04:23.175
It is the task of this council
to determine your eligibility
for pardon.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.047
What say you?

04:25.221 --> 04:28.529
Thank you, Chancellor Anderton,
esteemed members of the council.

04:30.095 --> 04:34.404
Before I begin, I notice
that Chancellor Jarnathan
is not present.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.188
Should we perhaps wait?

04:36.363 --> 04:39.627
Chancellor Jarnathan was delayed
by the storm. You may begin.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.368
I see. It'’s just that I--

04:41.542 --> 04:44.849
we were really counting
on him to attend.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.199
Begin or waive
your statement.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.853
Very well.

04:50.681 --> 04:53.510
I should start
by giving you some context.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.079
You may be surprised to learn
I wasn'’t always a thief.

04:57.253 --> 05:01.126
Years ago, I became a member
of the Harpers faction,

05:01.301 --> 05:04.129
a network of spies who
swear an oath to fight tyranny,

05:04.304 --> 05:07.655
defend the oppressed
and to ask nothing in return.

05:07.829 --> 05:11.659
My wife, Zia,
supported my decision,
even though she knew the risks.

05:13.748 --> 05:16.533
By day,
I'’d eavesdrop on mercenaries,

05:17.360 --> 05:20.058
stop bandits in their tracks...

05:22.844 --> 05:25.803
and even bring
Thayan Red Wizards to justice.

05:29.372 --> 05:33.333
By night, I'’d come home
to my loving wife,
and daughter, Kira.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.988
To be honest, there were times
when I began to question

05:37.162 --> 05:40.601
the "asking nothing in return"
part of my oath.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.733
But my wife would always say,

05:42.907 --> 05:45.649
"You don'’t have
to give us everything,
you only have to give us you."

05:45.823 --> 05:46.911
So what'’s the latest
on Jarnathan?

05:47.085 --> 05:49.000
Is he close by?
Because I can wait.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.263
Did you not hear what we said?Right, the storm.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.614
It'’s just that based on
what I know about Jarnathan,

05:53.788 --> 05:55.790
I think he'’d be especially
receptive to my story.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.966
And I'’d hate to have to wait
a whole other year

05:58.140 --> 06:00.229
to come back in here and--Proceed.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.013
Absolutely. Here we go.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.581
When you'’re a Harper,
you'’re bound to make enemies.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.064
And sometimes those enemies
come looking for revenge.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.900
No cleric can repair the damage
from a Red Wizard'’s blade.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.946
There was no way to revive her.

07:06.034 --> 07:10.038
When Zia died,
so did my devotion to my oath.

07:28.448 --> 07:32.147
I'’m sorry, it'’s just hard
to relive this...

07:33.583 --> 07:36.194
-without Jarnathan here.
-Again with this?

07:36.368 --> 07:38.370
But he missed the most
important part of my backstory!

07:38.545 --> 07:40.677
How can he judge me
without knowing my motivation?

07:40.851 --> 07:44.376
We are entirely capable
of deciding your case
without Jarnathan.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.205
-Get on with it!
-Fine. Where was I? Uh...

07:47.379 --> 07:50.731
By night, I'’d come home
to my loving wife,
and daughter Kira.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.559
You went back too far.
Stop stalling!

07:52.733 --> 07:55.213
Right, sorry.
Yeah, broad strokes.

07:55.387 --> 08:00.218
The next few months
were among my most shameful.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.309
That'’s when I met Holga.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.224
She took pity on me.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.967
Well,
she took pity on the baby.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.709
Holga was a fellow resident
of rock bottom.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.583
Many years before, she'’d
been cast out of her tribe

08:16.757 --> 08:18.410
for falling in love
with an outsider.

08:22.676 --> 08:25.461
We quickly became like
brother and sister.

08:25.635 --> 08:29.073
With a relationship built
on trust and mutual respect.

08:32.424 --> 08:35.079
Neither of us had money
or an honest way to earn it,

08:35.253 --> 08:39.127
so we decided to table "honest"
and we tried something new.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.522
It'’s intoxicating
when you realize

08:42.696 --> 08:46.134
that what separates you
from what you'’ve always wanted

08:46.308 --> 08:49.224
can be as thin
as a pane of glass.

09:03.499 --> 09:06.284
You may be wondering how
we could carry on
this criminal lifestyle

09:06.458 --> 09:07.721
with a young girl at home.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.593
Well, we didn'’t
leave her at home.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.857
Hurry, hurry! Run, run, run!

09:15.119 --> 09:16.599
Kira wasn'’t
the only new recruit.

09:16.773 --> 09:19.341
We also added Simon,
a so-so sorcerer,

09:19.515 --> 09:23.563
and a con man named Forge,
who pushed us to aim
even higher.

09:27.784 --> 09:30.004
Before long, we became a team.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.659
Yes, we were thieves,

09:32.833 --> 09:35.183
but I tried to hold us
to a certain standard.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.924
We never harmed anyone.

09:37.098 --> 09:40.057
And we only robbed from those
who would feel it the least.

09:41.537 --> 09:45.802
But everything changed
when we met the wizard Sofina.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.631
We knew almost nothing
about her.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.895
Only that she wanted our help
in robbing Korinn'’s Keep.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.724
That'’s a Harper stronghold.
I don'’t know if you'’ve
heard of it.

09:54.898 --> 09:57.031
I'’m sure Jarnathan has.

09:57.205 --> 10:00.251
The keep was filled
with the priceless relics
seized from evildoers,

10:00.425 --> 10:02.993
and only Harpers could
gain access to the vault.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.300
Which is why Sofina came to us.

10:05.474 --> 10:08.651
At first, I refused.
I wouldn'’t stoop that low.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.611
But then Forge told me
that among the relics
in Korinn'’s Keep,

10:11.785 --> 10:13.917
there was
a Tablet of Reawakening,

10:14.091 --> 10:17.312
capable of bringing back
a single deceased person.

10:17.486 --> 10:20.054
Even one killed
by a Red Wizard'’s blade.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.360
You can probably see
where this is going.

10:22.534 --> 10:25.886
Why can'’t I come?Sorry, Kir,
this one'’s too dangerous.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.844
Then you shouldn'’t go.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.325
We have everything
that we need.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.415
Not yet.
But this is the last one.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.635
Trust me.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.467
Chin up, Bug.
We'’ll be right back.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.252
I didn'’t tell her
about the tablet.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.036
It would break her heart
if it all went to shit.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.821
And, well,

10:48.430 --> 10:49.953
to shit it went.

11:20.723 --> 11:21.724
See you soon, love.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.129
Intruders!

11:35.825 --> 11:36.739
There they are!

11:42.310 --> 11:43.964
We don'’t hurt anyone.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.678
She'’s caught in the Time Stop!
Counter it, Simon!

12:02.852 --> 12:04.680
I can'’t.
Sofina'’s too powerful.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.737
Take the tablet.
Keep Kira safe.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.873
You have my word.

12:34.275 --> 12:38.061
The truth is, even if
this council were to sentence
me to another two years,

12:38.235 --> 12:40.716
or 20 for that matter,

12:40.890 --> 12:45.721
it would never be punishment
enough for the worst crime
I ever committed...

12:47.549 --> 12:49.899
robbing my daughter
of her father.

12:50.073 --> 12:53.685
But know that,
if you do choose to free me,

12:53.860 --> 12:56.950
I'’ll spend the rest of my days
trying to right that wrong.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.953
Anything you want to add?

13:00.127 --> 13:01.432
I'’m good.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.788
Before you announce
your decision,

13:08.962 --> 13:11.834
I implore you
to please wait for--

13:14.054 --> 13:15.664
Jarnathan!Pardon my belatedness.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.362
I can'’t tell you how happy
I am to see you!Step away!

13:18.536 --> 13:21.104
Holga, now!Guards!

13:21.278 --> 13:23.106
Release me, sir!

13:23.280 --> 13:25.282
She'’s throwing potatoes!

13:26.109 --> 13:27.328
Oh, Jarnathan!

13:29.330 --> 13:30.853
But we approved your pardon!

13:44.606 --> 13:46.738
Fly, bird, fly!

14:10.284 --> 14:11.807
He'’s still breathing.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.464
I told you he'’d get us out!

15:23.052 --> 15:24.053
Any sign of Kira?

15:25.794 --> 15:27.491
Been empty for a while.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.422
Where do you think
Forge took her?

15:45.596 --> 15:48.773
I can'’t see him leaving
the Sword Coast.
Forge always liked cities.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.299
Some supper
for you and your wife?

15:52.473 --> 15:54.866
What? No.
She'’s not my wife.Me with that?

15:55.041 --> 15:57.869
With those lips?That'’s so gross.
Just the drinks.

16:00.220 --> 16:03.049
So, we take a boat
down to Baldur'’s Gate

16:03.223 --> 16:05.094
and then head north.

16:05.268 --> 16:08.706
And while we'’re
looking for Forge,
I'’ll pay Marlamin a visit.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.319
You sure you really want
to put yourself through that?

16:12.493 --> 16:15.887
What if he doesn'’t want
to talk to you?It'’s not about what he wants.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.802
Okay.It'’s about closure.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.327
He sent you a letter saying
he wasn'’t your husband anymore.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.503
Wasn'’t that closure?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.244
You wouldn'’t understand.I don'’t.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.376
I clearly, clearly don'’t.

16:31.599 --> 16:32.904
Is that...

16:34.036 --> 16:35.820
Son of a bitch.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.910
Forge is
Lord of Neverwinter.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.870
How did that clown
pull that off?

16:42.044 --> 16:44.133
Well, as long as he'’s got Kira,
I don'’t care.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.092
Come on. Let'’s go.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.225
Thanks, pal.
What'’s wrong with my lips?

16:49.399 --> 16:51.532
They'’re too big
for your face.What?

16:51.706 --> 16:52.794
A lot of people
like my lips.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.348
I'’ve never seen
this place so crowded.

17:25.522 --> 17:28.177
Must be coming in
for the High Sun Games.

17:28.351 --> 17:31.441
Yeah, my dad
took me to the last one
before they were outlawed.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.095
Anyone win?

17:33.269 --> 17:35.445
Well, one contestant made it
to the final round

17:35.619 --> 17:38.144
before a monster ate
his upper body, so...

17:39.406 --> 17:40.407
no.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.717
It'’s nice to see
that Forge hasn'’t lost
his sense of modesty.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.812
How long has it been?Two years.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.945
No, how long have
we been waiting here?

17:59.426 --> 18:00.427
Dad.

18:01.384 --> 18:02.603
Holga?

18:03.212 --> 18:04.213
Kira.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.479
Oh!

18:09.653 --> 18:12.308
-I missed you so much.
-Hello, Bug.

18:15.311 --> 18:16.747
-Come here.
-Hi.

18:17.313 --> 18:18.314
Oh.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.013
I thought about you
every day.

18:26.844 --> 18:27.845
I made you these.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.460
-What are they?
-Mittens!

18:33.634 --> 18:36.550
Oh. Thanks.

18:37.681 --> 18:38.900
Have you been okay?

18:40.031 --> 18:42.295
Uncle Forge has been
very good to me.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.340
"Uncle" Forge?

18:46.342 --> 18:48.910
Come on.
He wants to see you.

18:50.477 --> 18:53.262
I still wear the pendant
you got me, Holga.

18:53.436 --> 18:56.874
I use it to sneak around
the castle sometimes.

18:58.441 --> 19:01.531
So strange that you'’re here.Hey, Kir, look.

19:03.446 --> 19:07.407
I want you to know I am so sorry
for how things turned out.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.626
I took a risk.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.193
And it didn'’t pay off.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.195
Why do you look mad at me?

19:14.979 --> 19:17.330
Because you'’re acting like
it wasn'’t your fault.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.549
There they are!

19:21.334 --> 19:22.596
Oh!

19:22.770 --> 19:24.293
Old friends.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.122
What a wonderful surprise. Come.

19:30.865 --> 19:31.996
Oh?

19:32.171 --> 19:35.043
Do I spy
a little bit of gray?

19:35.217 --> 19:36.392
I do. I like it.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.829
It'’s scoundrelly
but professorial.

19:39.003 --> 19:41.571
You look like a--
What do you look like?

19:41.745 --> 19:44.748
You look like
a well-read fisherman
with secrets.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.099
And Holga.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.059
I know you don'’t
like hugs.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.887
But I need one. Yes?

19:53.757 --> 19:56.020
-Oh.
-Mmm. Mmm.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.805
Mmm! Mmm.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.373
These last years
must have been dreadful,

20:00.547 --> 20:03.027
but I tell you what,
I did think you'’d serve longer.

20:03.202 --> 20:07.858
Oh! Uh, we-- We got an...
early release.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.817
Good behavior.Yeah, behaving good.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.819
Ah. I see.

20:11.993 --> 20:14.213
Well, welcome. Welcome back.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.520
Oh, that'’s blistering.
That'’s blisteringly hot.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.087
Yet again.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.568
Kira, we really should speak
to the kitchen staff,

20:21.742 --> 20:24.092
because there'’s simply no need
for it to be this hot.

20:24.266 --> 20:28.096
Yeah, yeah, the tea'’s hot.
So, how are you
the Lord of Neverwinter?

20:28.270 --> 20:33.623
Right. Before you went off
to prison, you charged me
with Kira'’s well-being.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.234
Didn'’t think much of it
at the time.

20:35.408 --> 20:38.280
But there came a moment
when I looked into her eyes,

20:38.454 --> 20:40.935
and I suddenly knew
I had to be a better man.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.807
Obviously, I couldn'’t give back
the treasures we'’d stolen,

20:43.981 --> 20:45.766
so when Lord Neverember
fell ill,

20:45.940 --> 20:49.770
I seized the chance to try and,
you know, make a difference.

20:49.944 --> 20:52.163
And the money from Korinn'’s Keep
paved the way for my campaign.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.165
But I will tell you this...

20:54.340 --> 20:56.080
Couldn'’t have done it alone.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.474
Ah! And here she is!

20:58.648 --> 21:00.607
You remember Sofina.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.349
You'’re still working with her?She'’s the one
that got us caught.

21:03.523 --> 21:06.787
Not true, no.
Without her,
we all would have been caught.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.832
And since then,
she has become...

21:09.616 --> 21:12.314
my top adviser. Mmm.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.884
The tea is scorching,
I do apologize.
It'’s scorching hot.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.234
Um, Sofina.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.672
Would you mind very much, um...

21:23.325 --> 21:24.587
Certainly.

21:28.939 --> 21:29.897
Hmm.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.291
Good. Thank you. I-- I'’m...

21:32.465 --> 21:36.033
I didn'’t realize you were
gonna put your finger
in the cup, so...

21:36.860 --> 21:38.949
I'’m gonna leave that for later.

21:39.123 --> 21:42.518
Well, if you'’ll give us
the tablet, Kira, Holga
and I will be on our way.

21:42.692 --> 21:45.782
Of course that'’s why
you came back.

21:45.956 --> 21:48.219
No, it wasn'’t for me.
It was for that
Tablet of Riches.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.830
Riches?

21:50.004 --> 21:53.268
No, it'’s-- it'’s
the Tablet of Reawakening.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.487
I'’m sorry, what'’s this now?

21:54.661 --> 21:57.141
The reason why
I agreed to the heist.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.014
Is that what he'’s told you?
That I left you for more riches?

22:00.188 --> 22:02.669
I told her the truth.
She has a right to know it.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.846
He'’s been lying
to you, Kira.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.979
I wanted to-- I wanted
to bring your mother back.

22:09.153 --> 22:11.895
Oh, Ed, come on.
Look, I know how much
you crave her forgiveness,

22:12.069 --> 22:13.810
but I promise you,
more lies is not the way.

22:13.984 --> 22:15.638
You snake!

22:15.812 --> 22:18.075
You know damn well
what he was after.

22:18.249 --> 22:20.861
Why wouldn'’t you tell me
if you were doing it for Mom?

22:21.035 --> 22:23.820
Because I didn'’t want you
to lose her again if I failed.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.606
But you can'’t blame
the poor girl
for distrusting you.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.216
After all,

22:29.739 --> 22:33.308
you have been lying since
you set foot in the room,
haven'’t you?

22:38.618 --> 22:41.142
-You escaped?
-We were trying
to get back to you, Bug.

22:41.316 --> 22:42.622
Kira, look at me.

22:42.796 --> 22:45.712
I swear to you, it was
a Tablet of Reawakening.

22:45.886 --> 22:48.671
I was doing it for Mom,
for all of us.
You have to trust me.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.848
You told me to trust you
when you left me.

22:55.199 --> 22:56.940
Kira, no, wait, wait!
Kira!

22:57.114 --> 22:58.551
Give her time,
give her time.

22:58.725 --> 23:01.510
She'’s had years to resent you
for your absence.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.121
And you'’ve had years
to poison her against me.

23:04.295 --> 23:05.601
No, that is not true.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.212
We very rarely
spoke of you at all.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.302
Give him what he came for.The tablet?

23:11.477 --> 23:13.740
I don'’t think
I will be returning it.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.960
Or your daughter,
for that matter.

23:17.134 --> 23:18.397
You bastard!

23:24.881 --> 23:27.144
And now you'’re in the floor!

23:27.318 --> 23:29.495
Oh, I hate to see that.

23:29.669 --> 23:33.281
Sofina really is a very,
very powerful wizard!

23:33.455 --> 23:37.241
You'’d have thought that
you'’d have learned that
the last time she trapped you.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.549
You always wanted us
to get caught.

23:40.723 --> 23:44.771
No, I wanted you and Simon
to get caught, but he managed
to escape somehow.

23:44.945 --> 23:48.644
All these years together,
and you double-cross us
for this witch?

23:48.818 --> 23:51.038
Never put your trust
in a con man.

23:51.212 --> 23:52.213
Save for this...

23:52.387 --> 23:54.171
Kira really is happy

23:54.345 --> 23:55.695
and very well
taken care of here,

23:55.869 --> 23:58.698
and I have truly come
to love her as my own.

23:58.872 --> 24:03.006
I never actually saw the appeal
of being a father
till I became one.

24:03.180 --> 24:06.706
But to have another person
look up to you

24:06.880 --> 24:09.665
and allow you to shape them
in your own image.

24:09.839 --> 24:11.711
It'’s a bit like a god!

24:11.885 --> 24:16.193
Well, hang on,
I'’m a god and a lord.
I am really doing all right!

24:16.367 --> 24:17.673
Blackwood?

24:17.847 --> 24:20.197
Could you possibly
return them to prison?

24:20.371 --> 24:22.069
And be sure
to collect the bounty.

24:22.243 --> 24:24.332
Well, I must away.

24:24.506 --> 24:27.727
I am expecting two
of the wealthiest men from
Baldur'’s Gate and Waterdeep

24:27.901 --> 24:30.991
to talk about
the High Sun Games,
which are back!

24:31.165 --> 24:32.906
So there'’s something, isn'’t it?

24:33.080 --> 24:35.430
It was genuinely lovely
to see you both.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.825
Ah! Ah!

24:38.999 --> 24:40.609
Holga! Holga! Holga!

24:43.351 --> 24:45.092
Kill both of them.

24:51.402 --> 24:53.796
We got to get her out
of there.We will.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.320
But we need to think
of our own hides right now.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.280
-Yeah, you got this, right?
-I know you don'’t.

24:59.454 --> 25:01.021
On your knees.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.201
Handsome blade.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.204
Is that the work
of Ghelryn Foehammer?

25:11.031 --> 25:11.945
How did you know?

25:12.119 --> 25:13.773
The inlay on the haft.

25:15.339 --> 25:16.645
Oh.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.778
How'’s the weight? Does it parry?

25:19.953 --> 25:21.128
It'’s darksteel.

25:21.302 --> 25:22.477
Mmm. Very nice.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.000
Now put your heads down.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.090
Wait!

25:27.264 --> 25:28.744
What do you clean it with?

25:29.919 --> 25:31.965
You'’re about
to lose your head.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.836
This is what
you'’re concerned with?

25:34.663 --> 25:36.535
If you wouldn'’t mind.

25:38.493 --> 25:41.757
Boiled linseed oil.
Once a month.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.934
Should be once a week.
That'’s why you'’re getting
rust on the bit.

25:46.196 --> 25:48.764
Okay, chop it off.Chop it off, let'’s do it.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.165
Get her!

26:11.047 --> 26:12.135
Stop her!

26:16.183 --> 26:18.359
Oh, we got '’em now!

26:45.386 --> 26:48.519
-Before we leave the city--
-Get boiled linseed oil, I know.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.615
Knock, knock.

26:57.964 --> 27:00.357
I wanted to make sure
you were all right.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.711
I knew I'’d see him again
one day.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.758
I just hoped
it would be different.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.500
Well, you have
to understand that

27:13.501 --> 27:15.416
when he lost your mother,

27:16.199 --> 27:17.897
he sort of lost himself.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.989
Why did he lie
about the tablet?

27:24.555 --> 27:27.994
Maybe he was ashamed to admit
how much he'’d given up
for so little.

27:31.432 --> 27:33.086
I should probably go
speak to him.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.438
What?

27:37.612 --> 27:39.745
Well, he'’s gone, my dear.
He'’s gone.

27:39.919 --> 27:42.443
I gave him
the Tablet of Riches and...

27:43.923 --> 27:45.098
he left.

27:49.711 --> 27:50.930
Holga, too?

27:52.845 --> 27:54.194
I'’m sorry.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.939
And I want you to know that
even if he isn'’t there for you,

28:00.113 --> 28:02.071
I always will be.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.857
I know.

28:05.945 --> 28:08.208
The fact that
you see good in me,

28:08.382 --> 28:11.124
makes me believe that there
might just be some in there.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.519
We could shoot an arrow
with a message into her room.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.480
What if it hits her?That'’s a risk we'’re gonna
have to take.

28:19.654 --> 28:23.005
Killing my daughter with
an arrow? No, it'’s not.

28:23.179 --> 28:26.226
Even if she got the message,
she wouldn'’t come.
She thinks of...

28:26.966 --> 28:28.794
Forge as her dad.

28:30.447 --> 28:33.059
We have to get into that castle
and take her out ourselves.

28:33.233 --> 28:35.539
That'’s crazy, Ed.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.281
Castle Never'’s tighter than
Korinn'’s Keep, and you know
what happened with that.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.457
We'’re gonna need a team.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.372
Team?
Who'’s gonna help us out?

28:42.546 --> 28:45.941
We have nothing
to pay them with.Yeah, but Forge does.

28:46.115 --> 28:48.465
He said the richest people
were coming to bet on
the High Sun Games.

28:48.639 --> 28:51.251
There'’ll be a fortune
in that vault.Yeah.

28:51.425 --> 28:53.383
Not to mention the tablet.

28:53.557 --> 28:54.820
And then Kira will
know that--

28:54.994 --> 28:57.474
We abandoned her
for the right reason.

28:58.693 --> 29:02.610
I wouldn'’t put it like that,
but, uh, yeah. Yeah.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.004
Who do we get
for this team?

29:05.178 --> 29:07.310
You know, I wonder
if Simon'’s still in Triboar.

29:07.484 --> 29:09.617
Simon'’s a terrible sorcerer.

29:09.791 --> 29:12.446
We haven'’t seen him
in two years.
I'’m sure he'’s gotten better.

29:13.708 --> 29:17.103
No one can hold a candle
to this trick.

29:21.281 --> 29:24.414
How about this one?
You people like the smell
of fresh-cut grass?

29:28.810 --> 29:31.160
Smell that?
It'’s fresh-cut grass.

29:31.334 --> 29:33.728
My five-year-old can
do that magic.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.774
But can he do this?

29:38.864 --> 29:40.300
Boo.

29:40.474 --> 29:42.171
He hasn'’t gotten better.

29:42.345 --> 29:44.347
I don'’t think it'’s about
what he'’s doing up there.

29:44.521 --> 29:47.481
This is quite hard
to be slightly blurry
like this, you know.

29:47.655 --> 29:50.092
Anyone can be very blurry,
but to be slightly blurry,

29:50.266 --> 29:51.790
that'’s the real magic.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.140
Is that...

29:58.100 --> 30:00.624
What? What was...

30:00.799 --> 30:03.192
Hey!

30:03.366 --> 30:05.238
He'’s nickin'’
our bits and bobs!

30:05.412 --> 30:07.457
It'’s not what you think.
It'’s all part of the act.

30:07.631 --> 30:08.763
He'’s lying.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.286
Get him!

30:15.465 --> 30:16.640
Shield spell!

30:16.815 --> 30:18.164
Shield spell!

30:25.693 --> 30:28.348
That wasn'’t a shield spell.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.931
I am not loving this show.

30:49.369 --> 30:50.936
You'’re a dead man!

31:10.390 --> 31:11.652
-Simon?
-Holga!

31:11.826 --> 31:14.133
-Staying for an encore?
-Get me out of here.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.929
I could'’ve warned you
Forge was a prick.

31:28.103 --> 31:30.279
Soon as we left that vault,
Sofina tried to kill me

31:30.453 --> 31:32.107
and he just stood by.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.544
You know, there'’s rumors she
made Lord Neverember fall ill

31:34.718 --> 31:36.111
to clear the way for Forge.

31:36.285 --> 31:37.983
Her magic is
on a whole other level.

31:38.157 --> 31:40.637
Don'’t sell yourself short.
We saw your show.

31:40.811 --> 31:43.292
Yeah, you can hit her with
that fresh-cut grass trick.

31:43.466 --> 31:44.946
That'’s funny.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.122
Look, I don'’t blame you
for wanting to save Kira,

31:47.296 --> 31:50.038
and I love the idea of
knocking Forge off his perch,

31:50.212 --> 31:52.127
but robbing Castle Never
isn'’t worth the risk.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.955
And robbing your audience is?

31:55.739 --> 31:58.264
How broke are you?Desperately.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.614
I was planning on sleeping
in the theater tonight,

32:00.788 --> 32:03.051
but now that seems imprudent.So?

32:03.225 --> 32:06.141
Do we even know what sort
of arcane magic is
protecting the vault?

32:06.315 --> 32:07.708
We'’re gonna find out!How?

32:07.882 --> 32:09.971
You gonna sneak past
the entire Castle Watch?

32:10.145 --> 32:13.105
Me? No.
A druid maybe, a Wild Shape.

32:13.279 --> 32:15.846
They could get in and out
undetected as a--

32:16.021 --> 32:18.675
as a mouse or a...A deer.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.809
Yes, a deer!
It'’ll blend in with all
the other deer in the castle.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.028
Don'’t mock me.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.291
Where can we find a druid?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.642
I know a druid. Doric.

32:28.816 --> 32:30.861
She'’s truly one of a kind.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.299
Sounds romantic in nature.

32:33.473 --> 32:35.431
Yeah. For me it was.

32:35.605 --> 32:39.696
She, however, found my lack
of self-esteem unattractive.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.394
Not your best trait.

32:41.568 --> 32:42.743
Thank you.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.922
In the name
of Forge Fitzwilliam,

32:48.096 --> 32:52.796
the prisoner is hereby sentenced
to death by dismemberment,

32:52.971 --> 32:56.887
for the crime of speaking ill
of our leader.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.673
The Emerald Enclave
will never relent!

32:59.847 --> 33:01.588
Justice cannot be killed!

33:01.762 --> 33:03.372
On my command.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.287
Your Doric'’s a bit of a radical.Ready?

33:05.461 --> 33:06.593
Oh, no, that'’s not Doric.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.726
Move in!

33:09.900 --> 33:10.989
Kill her!

33:18.648 --> 33:20.041
Move in!

33:21.216 --> 33:22.696
Move in!

33:22.870 --> 33:24.132
That'’s her.

33:37.972 --> 33:40.018
What is that again?It'’s an owlbear.

34:13.355 --> 34:16.315
-How high is this place?
-It'’s just up here.

34:16.489 --> 34:19.013
Stay where you are!Wait! Wait! It'’s me!

34:19.709 --> 34:21.668
Simon.Simon who?

34:21.842 --> 34:22.886
Ouch.

34:23.061 --> 34:26.368
Simon Aumar. Sorcerer.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.414
I courted you.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.851
You said I made you feel sad.

34:31.025 --> 34:33.897
Not from anything I did,
just from who I was.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.421
Oh.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.250
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:38.424 --> 34:39.903
What are you doing here?

34:40.078 --> 34:42.297
We need a deer.We don'’t need a deer.

34:42.471 --> 34:44.386
We'’re gonna take down
Forge Fitzwilliam.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.220
So, how'’d you come
to live here?

34:52.394 --> 34:55.702
I was born to humans who
decided they didn'’t want
a tiefling child.

34:55.876 --> 34:58.139
Uh-huh.The wood elves took me in.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.141
I joined the Emerald Enclave
to protect them.

35:00.315 --> 35:01.882
That'’s all the more reason
to join us.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.493
You'’re the only one who can
get into that castle unseen

35:04.667 --> 35:06.191
and tell us what
we'’re dealing with.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.889
As you can imagine,
I don'’t trust humans.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.457
I find you to be
hateful and selfish.

35:11.631 --> 35:14.503
Well, I'’m finding you to be
a little mean.

35:14.677 --> 35:16.505
If it helps,
I'’m only half-human.

35:16.679 --> 35:17.941
But you'’re a bad sorcerer.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.292
No, Simon--
He'’s a mighty sorcerer!

35:20.466 --> 35:23.077
He'’s a descendant
of Elminster Aumar.

35:23.251 --> 35:27.212
The only way to succeed in this
is to have confidence
that it can be done.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.649
He doesn'’t.Yeah, I suppose that'’s fair.

35:29.823 --> 35:33.914
Look, Simon may not have my wit
or Holga'’s strength,

35:34.088 --> 35:36.177
but when it counts,
this young man delivers.

35:36.351 --> 35:39.180
It'’s why I chose him.He'’s also the only sorcerer
you know.

35:39.354 --> 35:40.703
Holga, not helpful.

35:40.877 --> 35:43.402
What is it exactly
that you bring to this?

35:43.576 --> 35:48.015
Me? I'’m a planner. You know?
I make plans.

35:48.189 --> 35:51.236
You'’ve already made the plan,
so what value do you have now?

35:52.715 --> 35:56.937
If, uh, the plan fails--
the existing plan--
I make a new plan.

35:57.111 --> 35:58.460
So you make plans
that fail.

35:58.634 --> 36:00.070
No.He also plays the lute.

36:00.245 --> 36:03.117
Holga, not relevant.
Trust me, I'’m indispensable.

36:06.773 --> 36:08.557
Well,

36:08.731 --> 36:11.908
none of the plans we'’ve tried
to take down Forge have worked.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.782
We dared to question
how he came to power,

36:15.956 --> 36:17.697
so he declared us enemies.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.570
Began destroying our homes

36:21.744 --> 36:23.920
and executing our people.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.533
If we don'’t stop Forge soon,

36:28.490 --> 36:30.231
there'’ll be nothing left
to defend.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.149
I'’m not doing this
for the money.

36:36.759 --> 36:39.806
I'’m doing this for
the people who took me in
when no one else would.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.678
So we'’ll keep
your share then.

36:47.553 --> 36:50.556
I sense your impatience.

36:52.384 --> 36:53.472
Szass Tam.

36:54.734 --> 36:58.694
But you have always been
the disciple I rely on most.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.394
Doff your cowl.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.526
You needn'’t hide your sigils
from me.

37:07.094 --> 37:09.139
I'’d rather be flensed and flayed

37:09.314 --> 37:12.186
than spend another hour
with Forge Fitzwilliam.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.233
The man is insufferable.

37:17.626 --> 37:21.369
But we never would have
come this far without
his "charm."

37:22.588 --> 37:26.156
The living have befouled
this world long enough.

37:27.636 --> 37:31.684
Take solace in knowing
that your work here
is nearly complete.

37:34.339 --> 37:35.557
There you are!

37:36.950 --> 37:39.431
With your hood off,
I notice.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.521
Probably best
to keep that on.

37:42.695 --> 37:45.045
You know,
you Red Wizards of Thay

37:45.219 --> 37:48.353
are not as popular as you
should be outside Thay.

37:48.527 --> 37:52.270
And, of course, you'’re about
to be considerably less popular.

37:53.793 --> 37:58.580
But far, far be it from me
ever to tell you what to do.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.365
Caldwell and Piradost
have arrived.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.932
I was gonna give them--

38:03.106 --> 38:05.935
Awful, isn'’t it? I really
have to do something about
these chairs.

38:06.109 --> 38:07.633
They'’re, uh...

38:09.374 --> 38:12.594
Now, I think you will find
that we have taken
every imaginable measure

38:12.768 --> 38:15.031
to protect the assets
that you may-- or may not--

38:15.205 --> 38:17.730
choose to wager
during the High Sun Games.

38:17.904 --> 38:21.124
We have new portcullises
on every wing of the castle.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.865
If the alarm is raised,

38:23.039 --> 38:26.216
nobody gets in or out.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.743
And then there is...

38:30.917 --> 38:32.875
the vault itself.

38:34.181 --> 38:37.532
My chief adviser, Sofina,
can give you all the details.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.799
It is protected by
the Arcane Seal of Mordenkainen.

38:50.197 --> 38:51.546
Well, uh...

38:51.720 --> 38:55.376
perhaps not
all the details, but, uh,

38:55.550 --> 38:58.379
suffice to say it is
a seriously powerful spell.

38:58.553 --> 39:01.469
Might I inquire,
what prompted you
to resume the games?

39:01.643 --> 39:03.906
Lord Neverember
considered them
quite brutal.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.126
Lord Neverember and I are
very different men.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.302
For example, I prefer
to be up and about.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.348
He prefers to be
in a vegetative state.

39:12.045 --> 39:13.438
You are terrible.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.354
I can be naughty. No, I--

39:16.528 --> 39:19.705
The truth is that the games
bring the city together
like nothing else.

39:19.879 --> 39:25.624
And it is not the role
of government to deny
the people what they crave.

39:25.798 --> 39:29.889
Or to deny you rich bastards
the right to profit off them.

39:32.108 --> 39:34.154
Now who wants refreshments?

39:34.328 --> 39:35.634
Silence!

39:38.637 --> 39:41.204
A Wild Shape is among us.

40:09.842 --> 40:11.104
Hey!

40:11.278 --> 40:12.540
Stop!

40:19.895 --> 40:21.419
I can'’t grab her!

42:15.707 --> 42:18.057
So she did become a deer.

42:18.231 --> 42:19.885
Only at the very end.

42:20.059 --> 42:22.714
Are you absolutely sure
about Sofina?I saw her markings.

42:22.888 --> 42:24.846
No wonder I couldn'’t counter
her Time Stop.

42:25.020 --> 42:28.110
Forge knew all along.
He'’s got my daughter in there
with a Red Wizard.

42:28.284 --> 42:32.375
The vault is protected
by something called
"Morty Kamen'’s Arcane Seal."

42:32.550 --> 42:33.768
Mordenkainen?

42:33.942 --> 42:36.162
Yeah, that'’s it.Oh, pity.

42:36.336 --> 42:38.338
What?If the vault has
Mordenkainen'’s Seal,

42:38.512 --> 42:40.035
we'’re not getting in.
It'’s impenetrable.

42:40.209 --> 42:41.733
Can'’t you just open it
with magic?

42:41.907 --> 42:43.778
Okay, here we go.

42:43.952 --> 42:47.216
I hate how everyone thinks
that you can solve
any problem with magic.

42:47.390 --> 42:50.350
There are limits.
This isn'’t some bedtime story.

42:50.524 --> 42:53.309
This is the real world.So there'’s no way to open it?

42:53.483 --> 42:57.531
No, I mean, if I were one
of the world'’s most powerful
sorcerers, so, no.

42:57.705 --> 42:59.402
Or if we had
the Helm of Disjunction.

42:59.968 --> 43:01.491
The what?

43:01.666 --> 43:03.668
It'’s a helmet that disables
all nearby enchantments.

43:03.842 --> 43:06.496
But it doesn'’t matter.
The thing went missing
ages ago. We'’re done.

43:06.671 --> 43:08.890
Huh? Come on.

43:09.064 --> 43:11.893
What'’s the problem?
We can find that helmet.

43:12.067 --> 43:15.505
Even if we did, I couldn'’t
use it without attuning to it,
which I'’m terrible at.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.551
You can do it.
I know you can.

43:17.725 --> 43:20.075
You saying that
doesn'’t make it so.Yeah, but you saying it does.

43:20.249 --> 43:21.468
But I can'’t.But you can.

43:21.642 --> 43:22.730
But I won'’t.Just say it.

43:22.904 --> 43:23.992
No!Fine.

43:24.166 --> 43:25.864
Can we just keep this
between us?

43:26.038 --> 43:28.867
I don'’t want to hurt
the group'’s morale.What morale?

43:30.390 --> 43:32.479
Holga knows where the helmet is.You do?

43:32.653 --> 43:35.656
My tribe fought
the Cult of the Dragon
over it at the Evermoors.

43:35.830 --> 43:37.615
We could just ask them
where it went.

43:37.789 --> 43:39.965
That battle was a century ago.
They'’re all dead.

43:40.139 --> 43:42.097
So? Ask them with magic.

43:42.271 --> 43:44.752
He just made a whole speech
how he can'’t fix everything
with magic.

43:44.926 --> 43:46.406
Actually,
that is something I can do.

43:47.668 --> 43:49.148
You can bring back
the dead?

43:49.322 --> 43:51.280
I can'’t, uh, bring them back,

43:51.454 --> 43:54.153
but I have this token
that lets me ask corpses
some questions,

43:54.327 --> 43:55.807
and then they go back
to being dead.

43:55.981 --> 43:58.070
Yuck.Yeah, it'’s fairly horrible.

43:58.244 --> 44:00.507
It'’s fairly wonderful.

44:00.681 --> 44:04.076
We'’re off to the Evermoors.
Thank you, Simon,
for the drinks.

44:04.250 --> 44:05.599
Oh, what? No--

44:05.773 --> 44:07.732
Just pay it with magic.

44:25.967 --> 44:30.537
The Wild Shape
must be in league with
Forge'’s former partners.

44:30.711 --> 44:33.148
Perhaps Forge is
working against us?

44:33.322 --> 44:35.324
As long as he profits,

44:35.498 --> 44:37.892
he will not interfere
with Szass Tam'’s conquest.

44:38.066 --> 44:39.894
I will find these thieves.

44:40.068 --> 44:41.853
Before you go,

44:42.027 --> 44:45.073
the men behind us
allowed them to escape.

44:45.683 --> 44:46.901
Understood.

44:48.424 --> 44:50.252
He'’s a Thayan!

45:14.581 --> 45:15.713
Hey, Ed.

45:16.888 --> 45:18.585
Huh?Look where we are.

45:19.629 --> 45:21.109
Marlamin? Really?

45:21.283 --> 45:23.155
Why would you do that
to yourself?

45:23.329 --> 45:25.548
I'’m just gonna pick up
some of my things.

45:30.858 --> 45:32.773
He painted the shutters.

45:33.382 --> 45:34.557
Pretty.

45:43.044 --> 45:44.045
Holga!

45:44.219 --> 45:45.873
Hello, Marlamin.

45:46.047 --> 45:48.267
-That'’s Marlamin?
-Oh, yeah.

45:48.441 --> 45:51.531
We were all a little surprised
the first time we met him.

45:52.488 --> 45:54.577
I thought your sentence
was longer.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.275
I busted out of there.

45:59.452 --> 46:01.236
Same old Holga.

46:03.412 --> 46:05.153
So what have you
been up to?

46:05.327 --> 46:07.068
Oh.

46:07.242 --> 46:08.678
The usual.

46:08.853 --> 46:11.159
I'’ve got my garden.
I'’m working on my book.

46:11.333 --> 46:14.032
I see you still have
that walking stick
I gave you.

46:14.206 --> 46:16.643
Yeah. Yeah.

46:16.817 --> 46:18.906
Well, you can take it with you
if you want.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.952
Gwinn'’s not much for rambling.Gwinn?

46:21.126 --> 46:22.649
You home, darling?In here.

46:22.823 --> 46:26.218
Oh! Squashed a pack
of bullywugs down at the--

46:26.392 --> 46:27.785
Oh. Hello.

46:27.959 --> 46:30.309
Who'’s this, then?Oh, Gwinn, this is Holga.

46:30.918 --> 46:32.224
Oh.

46:32.398 --> 46:34.139
Heard a lot about you.

46:34.313 --> 46:36.097
I'’d shake your hand,
but, uh...

46:36.271 --> 46:37.142
Pleasure.

46:37.316 --> 46:39.057
How long you in town for?

46:39.231 --> 46:40.667
Um, just passing through.

46:40.841 --> 46:43.148
Gonna talk to some corpses
south of Nesmé.

46:43.322 --> 46:44.802
Oh. Great, yeah.

46:46.542 --> 46:49.067
Gonna get washed up for supper.
What we having?

46:49.241 --> 46:51.286
I cured a goose
and I gathered
some pickleberries.

46:51.460 --> 46:52.635
Mmm.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.681
Nice meeting you, Holga.Yeah.

46:58.772 --> 47:01.514
So how long have you two--Going on a year.

47:02.210 --> 47:03.995
Does she make you happy?

47:04.169 --> 47:05.692
Happier than I did?

47:07.476 --> 47:09.914
Well, I'’ll put it this way:
She makes her living honestly.

47:10.088 --> 47:12.568
She doesn'’t
drink herself silly.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.486
And she doesn'’t make me weep
in the small hours,

47:17.660 --> 47:19.358
wondering where she is.

47:19.532 --> 47:21.055
I was in pain.

47:21.229 --> 47:23.797
I was banished
from my damn tribe
to be with you.

47:23.971 --> 47:26.974
And I tried to build us a home
so you could forget that.

47:29.498 --> 47:30.717
But you never could.

47:34.068 --> 47:35.809
Gwinn seems lovely.

47:36.854 --> 47:38.159
You deserve that.

47:38.333 --> 47:39.552
Thank you.

47:40.814 --> 47:43.382
You know, when you left,
I lost my family.

47:45.384 --> 47:48.039
I'’ve been fortunate enough
to find another.

47:49.823 --> 47:52.652
And I wish nothing less
than that for you.

47:56.221 --> 47:58.136
My sweet, old Ho-Ho.

48:12.890 --> 48:15.240
We'’re gonna take down Forge.

48:15.414 --> 48:20.245
I'’m gonna show Marlamin
and the Elk tribe
they were fools to let me go.

48:37.218 --> 48:41.962

48:42.136 --> 48:46.184

49:16.170 --> 49:19.608
♪ Who rather than revel repine♪

49:39.628 --> 49:43.154
So many of my kin gave
their lives in battle here.

49:44.938 --> 49:48.681
I'’d always imagined
I'’d be buried in
sacred ground like this.

49:48.855 --> 49:49.899
Yeah.

49:50.596 --> 49:52.293
Anyone got a shovel?

49:58.604 --> 50:01.085
Okay, Simon,
how does this work?

50:01.259 --> 50:04.001
I read the incantation
on this cleric'’s token.

50:04.175 --> 50:05.480
Should be here somewhere.

50:05.654 --> 50:07.613
Here!

50:07.787 --> 50:11.182
All right. Once the dead man
is revived, we can ask him
five questions,

50:11.356 --> 50:14.315
at which point
he will die again,
never to be re-revived.

50:14.489 --> 50:16.274
Why five questions?

50:16.448 --> 50:17.971
I don'’t know,
that'’s just how it works.Seems arbitrary.

50:18.145 --> 50:20.800
Can we get on with this, please?Right, yes.

50:29.243 --> 50:30.331
Delightful.

50:42.952 --> 50:44.345
Maybe I'’m not saying it right.

50:48.654 --> 50:50.264
I wasn'’t scared,
merely startled.

50:51.135 --> 50:53.441
Here we go.

50:54.964 --> 50:56.923
Were you killed in
the Battle of the Evermoors?

50:57.097 --> 50:58.968
Yes.Great!

50:59.143 --> 51:02.842
I mean, not for you.
Sorry for your loss.

51:03.016 --> 51:04.800
Four more questions, right?

51:04.974 --> 51:06.106
Yes.

51:06.280 --> 51:07.629
No. No, no,
that wasn'’t for you.

51:07.803 --> 51:08.935
Did that count
as a question?

51:09.109 --> 51:11.111
-Yes.
-Damn it.

51:12.069 --> 51:14.680
Only answer when
I talk to you, okay?

51:14.854 --> 51:17.509
Yes.Why did you say "okay?"
at the end of that?

51:17.683 --> 51:19.076
I didn'’t.

51:20.294 --> 51:21.861
Fantastic. Where'’s the shovel?

51:29.738 --> 51:31.000
Toke Horgath.

51:32.306 --> 51:35.831
During the battle, did you see
the Helmet of Disjunction?

51:36.005 --> 51:40.140
It was in possession
of my chief,
Stanhard Grimwulf.

51:40.314 --> 51:42.011
Okay, good.

51:42.186 --> 51:44.188
And what did
Stanhard Grimwulf do with it?

51:46.146 --> 51:50.629
As the cultists
breached the ridge,
we knew we outnumbered them.

51:50.803 --> 51:55.416
But our advantage meant nothing
against the dragon Rakor.

52:04.817 --> 52:06.123
Horgath!

52:06.732 --> 52:07.994
Horgath!

52:09.126 --> 52:11.084
Take this and run.

52:11.258 --> 52:13.869
Keep it from Rakor
at all costs!

52:14.043 --> 52:15.654
Understood, sir.
Don'’t worry.

52:15.828 --> 52:18.135
That'’s the last thing
I remember.

52:22.617 --> 52:24.141
Oh. Yeah, well...

52:25.142 --> 52:26.578
Thanks for your help.

52:26.752 --> 52:28.928
Let'’s go look
for Stanhard Grimwulf'’s grave.

52:29.102 --> 52:30.712
Hang on! Hang on!Hmm?

52:30.886 --> 52:32.758
Aren'’t you going to ask him
the last three questions?

52:32.932 --> 52:34.847
Ask him what?
He already told us
everything he knows.

52:35.021 --> 52:37.458
Well, you can'’t just
leave him like that.
Look at the poor bloke.

52:39.156 --> 52:40.461
Oh, fine.

52:41.593 --> 52:42.811
What'’s your favorite food?

52:43.725 --> 52:45.640
Oats. No, barley!

52:45.814 --> 52:47.207
Oh, boy.

52:48.469 --> 52:49.514
Do you like cats?

52:49.688 --> 52:50.950
Not really.

52:51.124 --> 52:52.169
Okay.

52:52.821 --> 52:53.909
What'’s two plus two?

52:54.083 --> 52:55.389
I'’m bad at math.

52:56.216 --> 52:57.348
Don'’t you feel better?No.

53:00.220 --> 53:01.482
Oftentimes,

53:01.656 --> 53:04.050
the most onerous decision
a leader can take

53:04.224 --> 53:05.965
is when to retreat.

53:06.922 --> 53:08.663
I issued the order.

53:10.839 --> 53:13.625
I commanded my battle lord
to deliver the helmet

53:13.799 --> 53:16.062
to our swiftest rider,
Ven Salafin.

53:16.236 --> 53:18.369
If we can just make it
over the ridge, we can--

53:19.674 --> 53:21.154
Not again.

53:22.764 --> 53:25.158
It was the morning
of the battle.

53:26.899 --> 53:30.294
As I stepped out my bath,
my foot slipped on the stone.

53:34.298 --> 53:36.169
And then you went into
the battle?

53:36.343 --> 53:39.738
No. I died. From the fall.

53:39.912 --> 53:42.784
But Stanhard Grimwulf said
he gave the helmet
to Ven Salafin.

53:42.958 --> 53:44.786
That'’s you, isn'’t it?

53:44.960 --> 53:48.137
I'’m Sven Salafin.
Ven'’s my brother.

53:48.312 --> 53:50.575
This is a nightmare.

53:50.749 --> 53:52.011
Is Ven all right?

53:54.622 --> 53:57.059
I was wounded
and had lost my horse

53:57.234 --> 53:58.844
as I escaped
the field of battle.

53:59.018 --> 54:01.412
I didn'’t care about myself.

54:01.586 --> 54:03.805
I just needed
to keep the helmet safe.

54:13.641 --> 54:17.254
It was a Thayan,
who bore the mark of Szass Tam.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.389
I waited for the killing blow.

54:23.129 --> 54:24.478
But it never came.

54:25.610 --> 54:27.481
He had a kind way.

54:27.655 --> 54:30.179
He told me
his name was Xenk Yendar.

54:30.354 --> 54:33.487
He had fled Szass Tam
and now lived in exile.

54:33.661 --> 54:37.448
As I died, he promised
to keep the helmet safe.

54:37.622 --> 54:39.580
And for some reason,
I believed him.

54:39.754 --> 54:41.974
You'’re joking.
A "kind" Thayan?

54:42.148 --> 54:43.062
I speak truth.

54:43.236 --> 54:44.672
You speak horseshit.

54:44.846 --> 54:47.022
That Thayan lied
and you died for nothing.

54:47.196 --> 54:49.982
The helmet'’s a dead end.
We'’ll have to find
another way into the vault.

54:50.156 --> 54:52.071
No, I'’ve heard of Xenk.

54:52.245 --> 54:54.465
He'’s a paladin.
He helped the Enclave
defeat the Clerics of Talos.

54:54.639 --> 54:55.814
I know the name as well.

54:55.988 --> 54:57.468
My uncle said Xenk
fended off a Beholder

54:57.642 --> 54:59.165
using only a sharpened gourd.

54:59.339 --> 55:01.994
A sharpened gourd?Something sharp.

55:02.168 --> 55:05.345
The Thayans are murderers.
End of story.

55:07.347 --> 55:08.348
What?

55:08.522 --> 55:10.437
I'’ve heard of him, too.No.

55:10.611 --> 55:13.310
He fought with my cousin
in the Anauroch.
He says he'’s a good man.

55:13.484 --> 55:17.226
Well, you can all
go find this lovely Xenk
and braid each other'’s hair.

55:17.401 --> 55:18.750
I'’ll find another way.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.929
What'’s his problem?He'’s got a history
with the Thayans.

55:24.103 --> 55:28.325
I know how you'’re feeling.
But we'’re running out of time.

55:30.936 --> 55:32.764
I'’d be betraying Zia.

55:32.938 --> 55:36.507
No, you wouldn'’t.
You'’d be doing it
to save her and Kira.

55:36.681 --> 55:39.161
Look, if Xenk turns out
to be a prick,

55:39.336 --> 55:41.207
I'’ll split him
right down the middle.

55:41.381 --> 55:44.645
That'’s very sweet.What have we got to lose?

55:48.606 --> 55:50.521
Anyone know where
stupid Xenk is?

55:50.695 --> 55:53.480
Last I heard, he was
working with the Harpers
in Mornbryn'’s Shield.

55:53.654 --> 55:55.482
Great! Harpers.

55:55.656 --> 55:57.310
What'’s his problem
with Harpers?

55:57.484 --> 55:59.007
He'’s got a history
with them too.

55:59.181 --> 56:00.531
All right, let'’s go.

56:01.488 --> 56:02.663
Excuse me?

56:03.925 --> 56:05.405
I'’m still alive.

56:05.579 --> 56:07.189
Right. Um...

56:08.495 --> 56:10.192
What'’s your favorite book?

56:10.367 --> 56:12.194
Mmm, hard to pick just one.

56:13.326 --> 56:14.545
Fifth question, right?Yep.

56:14.719 --> 56:16.677
Good.In terms of historical works,

56:16.851 --> 56:20.638
I'’d say The Fanged Tome
of Lykanthus Szar.

56:22.074 --> 56:24.250
That was only
the fourth question.

56:24.946 --> 56:26.078
Hello?

56:27.296 --> 56:28.689
Oh, shit.

56:31.779 --> 56:33.346
Heave! Heave!

56:33.520 --> 56:35.130
Come on,
we need more! Come on!

57:09.251 --> 57:10.905
It'’s alive!

57:13.125 --> 57:14.213
Thank you!

57:14.909 --> 57:16.258
Thank you, sir.

57:27.008 --> 57:29.402
He'’s interesting.I'’ve seen more interesting.

57:29.576 --> 57:31.448
Ed, go talk to him.You go talk to him.

57:31.622 --> 57:33.232
You know,
I'’ve pulled cats out of fish.

57:42.067 --> 57:43.111
Xenk, is it?

57:45.070 --> 57:46.419
That is a query
I prefer not to answer

57:46.593 --> 57:48.247
without knowing
to whom I am speaking.

57:48.421 --> 57:49.901
I'’m Holga Kilgore.

57:50.075 --> 57:53.165
This is Simon, Edgin
and Doric back there.

57:54.427 --> 57:57.386
And what brings you
to Mornbryn'’s Shield?You do.

57:57.561 --> 57:59.693
We'’re trying to find
the Helmet of Dysfunction.

57:59.867 --> 58:01.478
Disjunction.

58:01.652 --> 58:03.480
Many lives were lost
in defense of that helm.

58:03.654 --> 58:06.047
To speak of it would be
to diminish their sacrifice.

58:10.008 --> 58:11.139
Janklee.

58:12.227 --> 58:14.752
Jankleeto you as well,
good sir.

58:19.104 --> 58:21.846
You'’re known as a man
of honor and integrity,

58:22.020 --> 58:26.154
and I can assure you,
our reasons for wanting
the helmet are entirely noble.

58:26.328 --> 58:27.808
Yep.
We'’re gonna rob someone.

58:27.982 --> 58:29.375
Holga!

58:29.549 --> 58:32.117
Not just anyone.
Forge Fitzwilliam.

58:32.291 --> 58:34.380
And the Red Wizard of Thay
he'’s partnered with.

58:36.338 --> 58:37.601
Come with me.

58:42.388 --> 58:43.781
What is this place?

58:43.955 --> 58:46.348
A Harper sanctuary.

58:46.523 --> 58:48.655
But surely your friend Edgin
already knew that.

58:50.222 --> 58:51.702
How'’d you know
I was a Harper?

58:51.876 --> 58:54.226
You may have forsworn your oath,

58:55.270 --> 58:57.577
but your oath
hasn'’t forsworn you.

58:57.751 --> 59:01.755
Just because
that sentence is symmetrical
doesn'’t make it not nonsense.

59:01.929 --> 59:03.757
Why do you wish
to rob Fitzwilliam?

59:03.931 --> 59:06.586
He stole Edgin'’s daughter
and a great deal of treasure
from us.

59:06.760 --> 59:08.066
Also a Tablet of Reawakening.

59:08.240 --> 59:09.894
He doesn'’t need to know
all that.

59:10.068 --> 59:11.417
I was just...

59:11.591 --> 59:13.462
In other words,
Forge is a real son of a bitch.

59:13.637 --> 59:15.639
So you blame his mother
for his corruption.

59:15.813 --> 59:17.075
What?

59:17.249 --> 59:18.772
No, it'’s an expression.

59:18.946 --> 59:20.557
I see.

59:20.731 --> 59:22.776
I do not traffic
in colloquialisms.

59:23.734 --> 59:25.518
You'’re not a lot of fun,
are you?

59:25.692 --> 59:27.912
If Fitzwilliam
is truly allied
with a Red Wizard,

59:28.086 --> 59:31.611
their intentions must go
beyond the mere political.

59:31.785 --> 59:34.048
Over a century ago,
the necromancer Szass Tam

59:34.222 --> 59:36.877
was one of eight zulkirs
who ruled the nation of Thay.

59:37.051 --> 59:38.313
Great, a history lesson.

59:38.487 --> 59:40.577
But Tam'’s hunger for power
was absolute.

59:42.100 --> 59:44.015
On the eve of the solstice,

59:44.189 --> 59:47.192
residents of the capital
gathered for a celebration.

59:52.458 --> 59:56.114
Unbeknownst to them,
or his fellow rulers,

59:56.288 --> 59:58.159
Tam had a plan of his own:

59:59.117 --> 1:00:01.510
to stage an unholy coup.

1:00:27.798 --> 1:00:30.191
He unleashed
the Beckoning Death,

1:00:30.365 --> 1:00:33.891
a spell that would consume
the souls
of all who beheld it,

1:00:34.065 --> 1:00:36.763
enslaving them to his will.

1:00:36.937 --> 1:00:38.809
With the aid
of his Red Wizards,

1:00:38.983 --> 1:00:41.986
Szass Tam created an army
of the undead,

1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:45.337
allowing him to conquer
the entire nation.

1:00:48.732 --> 1:00:51.822
Szass'’s power extends no further
than the borders of Thay.

1:00:51.996 --> 1:00:54.041
I suspect he and his Red Wizards
will not be content

1:00:54.215 --> 1:00:57.218
until they have infected
the whole of Faerûn
with their maleficence.

1:00:57.392 --> 1:00:59.917
You done?
Because we already know
that Red Wizards are bad.

1:01:00.091 --> 1:01:01.658
And so does Forge.

1:01:01.832 --> 1:01:03.442
The question remains,
if they helped him
to take power,

1:01:03.616 --> 1:01:04.791
what do they stand to gain?

1:01:04.965 --> 1:01:06.880
Sounds like we have
a common enemy.

1:01:07.054 --> 1:01:08.795
You give us that helmet,
and we take Forge down.

1:01:08.969 --> 1:01:11.015
No one stays Lord
without a fortune
to back him up.

1:01:11.189 --> 1:01:12.886
And the Red Wizards
lose their puppet.

1:01:13.060 --> 1:01:15.193
What will become
of the wealth you burgle?

1:01:15.367 --> 1:01:17.151
What does that matter?

1:01:17.325 --> 1:01:19.806
I will not be complicit
in the illicit use
of ill-gotten booty.

1:01:19.980 --> 1:01:24.158
Uh... Fine. We'’ll divide it
amongst the townspeople.

1:01:24.332 --> 1:01:26.421
Swear to it.What?

1:01:26.595 --> 1:01:28.380
Place your hand
on this Harper'’s Seal

1:01:28.554 --> 1:01:31.688
and swear that you will indeed
distribute all the wealth
you take

1:01:31.862 --> 1:01:33.777
amongst the people
of Neverwinter.

1:01:33.951 --> 1:01:36.388
Sure, fine.

1:01:40.087 --> 1:01:41.610
Go on, Ed.

1:01:41.785 --> 1:01:44.309
Promise you'’ll give
Forge'’s money to the people.

1:01:49.967 --> 1:01:51.751
Promise I'’ll...

1:01:51.925 --> 1:01:54.449
give Forge'’s money
to the people of Neverwinter.

1:01:54.623 --> 1:01:56.147
Keep this.

1:01:57.322 --> 1:02:00.804
You may not yet
believe your words, but I do.

1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:05.286
Yeah. Good for you.
Simon, hold onto this.

1:02:05.460 --> 1:02:06.940
Now, where'’s the helmet?

1:02:07.114 --> 1:02:09.638
In the bowels of the Underdark.The Underdark?

1:02:09.813 --> 1:02:11.728
Weren'’t you trying
to keep it safe?
Why would you put it down there?

1:02:11.902 --> 1:02:14.600
Because it is the last place
that anyone
who values their life would go.

1:02:14.774 --> 1:02:16.254
Sounds lovely.Quite the opposite.

1:02:16.428 --> 1:02:18.952
I-I know. I was being ironic.

1:02:19.126 --> 1:02:22.826
I find irony is a blade
that cuts he who wields it
most especially.

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.872
Yeah?
Is that what you find, Xenk?

1:02:26.046 --> 1:02:28.005
There is an entrance east
of the Sword Mountains

1:02:28.179 --> 1:02:29.615
in the Kryptgarden Forest,

1:02:29.789 --> 1:02:32.792
from which we may descend
to the ruins of Dolblunde.

1:02:34.359 --> 1:02:37.884
If I may be so bold,
what caused you
to renounce the Harpers?

1:02:40.713 --> 1:02:42.976
Being a Harper
got my wife killed.

1:02:43.150 --> 1:02:45.283
I'’m sorry.

1:02:45.457 --> 1:02:47.198
Did her assailants find justice?

1:02:47.372 --> 1:02:48.982
The Thayans, you mean?

1:02:50.418 --> 1:02:51.550
No.

1:02:51.724 --> 1:02:53.726
The Thayans
are not all malevolent.

1:02:55.162 --> 1:02:57.730
I was a boy when Szass Tam
seized control of Thay.

1:03:00.951 --> 1:03:02.996
I saw firsthand
the horrors of the spell.

1:03:04.345 --> 1:03:07.087
Honorable men
turned to monsters.

1:03:07.261 --> 1:03:10.221
Minds wiped clean in moments.

1:03:10.395 --> 1:03:13.964
Parents
turning on their own child.

1:03:34.245 --> 1:03:36.813
I escaped, alive,

1:03:38.031 --> 1:03:40.207
but forever changed.

1:03:40.381 --> 1:03:43.994
You and I have both lost
a part of ourselves.

1:03:44.168 --> 1:03:46.910
All that matters
is what we do
with what remains.

1:03:47.736 --> 1:03:49.434
I told you
what I'’m gonna do.

1:03:49.608 --> 1:03:51.479
I'’m gonna break into
Castle Never
and get my family back.

1:03:52.263 --> 1:03:53.481
And the tablet?

1:03:53.655 --> 1:03:55.832
You plan to resurrect
your wife.Yeah.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:59.096
Very well.

1:03:59.270 --> 1:04:02.012
I'’d only ask that
you consider that this plane we
call "life" is but one of many.

1:04:02.186 --> 1:04:03.404
Uh-huh.

1:04:03.578 --> 1:04:05.537
To drag your lady-love
back to her old life

1:04:05.711 --> 1:04:07.321
is to deprive her
of her new one.

1:04:07.495 --> 1:04:10.150
Can someone else
ride next to this guy?

1:04:19.856 --> 1:04:21.509
Follow me to the orifice.

1:04:24.817 --> 1:04:26.427
The orifice?

1:04:28.038 --> 1:04:30.562
The Underdark
has many entrances.

1:04:33.304 --> 1:04:35.567
This is one of
the less conspicuous.

1:04:43.357 --> 1:04:44.706
I'’ll go last.

1:04:46.534 --> 1:04:49.886
It'’s a day'’s trek.
I'’ve chosen a path
to avoid the populace.

1:04:50.060 --> 1:04:52.453
Stay close
and quiet.

1:04:52.627 --> 1:04:56.675
Whatever you'’ve heard
of this place is merely
a fraction of its true danger.

1:04:58.242 --> 1:05:00.244
Should the way
become too dim,

1:05:00.418 --> 1:05:03.334
you may take my hand,
and I will lead you.

1:05:06.337 --> 1:05:08.992
I'’ll tell you right now,
I'’m not taking his hand.

1:05:20.438 --> 1:05:23.267
Keep your guard up.
I don'’t trust this guy.

1:05:24.137 --> 1:05:26.270
Even though
he'’s helping us?

1:05:26.444 --> 1:05:28.794
Ah, he'’s got something
up his sleeve.

1:05:28.968 --> 1:05:31.188
The only thing up my sleeve
is my arm.

1:05:31.362 --> 1:05:34.104
How could he hear that?I hear that as well.

1:05:34.931 --> 1:05:35.932
I hate you.

1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:52.296
The path to the ruins
is just here.

1:06:00.695 --> 1:06:01.609
Keep still!

1:06:05.309 --> 1:06:06.614
Rochnon.

1:06:06.788 --> 1:06:09.617
Intellect devourers.
Small but formidable.

1:06:09.791 --> 1:06:13.534
They stun their targets
and consume the brain,
taking control of the body.

1:06:13.708 --> 1:06:15.667
What do we do?Make no sound.

1:06:16.798 --> 1:06:18.975
They'’re drawn to mental energy.

1:06:19.149 --> 1:06:23.457
The higher the intelligence
of the prey, the more likely
they are to strike.

1:06:40.561 --> 1:06:42.346
Well, that'’s a little hurtful.

1:06:43.651 --> 1:06:47.307
There it is.
The Hanging City of Dolblunde.

1:06:48.526 --> 1:06:52.356
The helmet lies on the far side
of this chasm.

1:06:52.530 --> 1:06:56.882
But be warned,
the bridge is protected
by an ancient Gnomish trap.

1:06:57.056 --> 1:07:00.277
There is a precise formula
we must follow so as not to
trigger the mechanism.

1:07:00.451 --> 1:07:03.280
What'’s the formula?It'’s quite simple.

1:07:03.454 --> 1:07:05.891
Starting from the center,
use odd-numbered blocks only,

1:07:06.065 --> 1:07:08.328
moving forward with each step,
except for every fifth step,

1:07:08.502 --> 1:07:09.634
which must be a lateral move.

1:07:09.808 --> 1:07:11.462
Left or right, it matters not,

1:07:11.636 --> 1:07:13.594
so long as the leader
and the laggard
remain equidistant.

1:07:13.768 --> 1:07:16.771
After which, proceed.
Again, odd-numbered blocks only.

1:07:16.945 --> 1:07:20.036
However, at the midpoint
we switch
to even-numbered blocks.

1:07:20.210 --> 1:07:22.908
Same pattern,
except now a lateral move
after the fourth step,

1:07:23.082 --> 1:07:25.258
until we reach the three--

1:07:33.527 --> 1:07:35.181
I--

1:07:35.355 --> 1:07:37.140
I may have...

1:07:37.314 --> 1:07:39.446
put my foot
on the bridge.

1:07:39.620 --> 1:07:41.927
Didn'’t realize that'’s where
it technically started.

1:07:44.669 --> 1:07:47.019
So... sorry.

1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:55.071
It'’s not very
structurally sound.

1:07:56.942 --> 1:07:59.858
Can'’t you just magic us across?

1:08:00.032 --> 1:08:02.817
It'’s too far for telekinesis.

1:08:02.991 --> 1:08:05.603
I'’ve got some rope in my bag.

1:08:05.777 --> 1:08:07.344
I could tie it to the axe.

1:08:07.518 --> 1:08:09.694
Toss it across
so it sticks to the rock.

1:08:09.868 --> 1:08:13.263
You know rocks are hard, right?Shut up.

1:08:13.437 --> 1:08:14.742
Where did you get that?

1:08:16.179 --> 1:08:17.571
What,
Marlamin'’s walking stick?

1:08:17.745 --> 1:08:19.965
I swiped it from a wizard
over in the Greypeaks.

1:08:20.139 --> 1:08:21.967
That'’s not a walking stick.

1:08:23.621 --> 1:08:25.188
It'’s a Hither-Thither staff.

1:08:25.362 --> 1:08:28.191
A what?Should have a range
of around 500 yards.

1:08:29.670 --> 1:08:30.802
Watch.

1:08:30.976 --> 1:08:32.108
Hither.

1:08:33.283 --> 1:08:34.284
Thither.

1:08:36.329 --> 1:08:38.853
It works!

1:08:41.334 --> 1:08:42.553
See?

1:08:43.554 --> 1:08:45.643
Didn'’t even need the bridge!

1:08:46.557 --> 1:08:47.862
I did good.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:50.213
Good save.

1:09:30.818 --> 1:09:35.693
This I give you now,
trusting that you will
protect it with your very life.

1:09:36.389 --> 1:09:37.521
I will.

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.350
Hold this.

1:09:45.006 --> 1:09:46.878
There is evil here.

1:09:58.977 --> 1:10:00.108
Are those...

1:10:00.935 --> 1:10:02.241
Thayan assassins.

1:10:02.415 --> 1:10:05.505
You look older, Yendar.

1:10:05.679 --> 1:10:08.813
Must be all that
foul mortal blood.

1:10:08.987 --> 1:10:13.948
And you, Dralas,
look just as loathsome
as the last time we met.

1:10:14.122 --> 1:10:19.302
Then I'’ll see to it
we don'’t meet again.

1:10:19.476 --> 1:10:21.478
Leave them to me.

1:11:54.222 --> 1:11:56.268
I'’m glad he'’s on our side.

1:12:00.141 --> 1:12:01.055
We must flee.

1:12:01.229 --> 1:12:02.927
Why? You killed them all.

1:12:03.101 --> 1:12:05.712
'’Tis no simple feat
to kill that
which is already dead.

1:12:10.717 --> 1:12:12.850
Ready for
the next bout, Yendar?

1:12:15.156 --> 1:12:16.810
Quickly!

1:13:04.945 --> 1:13:06.817
That'’s one pudgy dragon.

1:13:06.991 --> 1:13:10.168
It'’s Themberchaud.
He must have found a new den.

1:13:10.342 --> 1:13:11.822
Did he eat the last one?

1:14:29.116 --> 1:14:30.204
I got you!

1:14:41.346 --> 1:14:43.174
It'’s a dead end!

1:14:43.957 --> 1:14:45.829
Simon! Up there!

1:15:38.011 --> 1:15:39.230
Thanks for that.

1:15:40.187 --> 1:15:41.972
You'’d have done
the same for me.

1:15:43.713 --> 1:15:44.714
Yeah.

1:15:47.281 --> 1:15:48.848
Bastard won'’t quit!

1:15:59.598 --> 1:16:01.644
Come on! He'’s stuck!

1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:03.994
So are we.

1:16:10.435 --> 1:16:12.263
We'’re gonna drown!

1:16:12.437 --> 1:16:15.527
Well, portal us out of here!I can only portal us
to what I can see!

1:16:15.701 --> 1:16:17.355
You want to go from
that wall to that wall?

1:16:18.574 --> 1:16:20.663
It'’s salt water.

1:16:20.837 --> 1:16:23.579
Simon, you remember that trick
you did in Triboar?

1:16:23.753 --> 1:16:24.710
Fresh-cut grass smell?

1:16:24.884 --> 1:16:27.191
No, the flame finger one.

1:16:27.365 --> 1:16:29.106
Yeah, why?Holga, hit him!

1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:31.108
You want to make him angrier?

1:16:31.282 --> 1:16:33.676
When I say so,
everybody goes underwater.

1:16:33.850 --> 1:16:36.287
And that'’ll be your cue, Simon,
all right?

1:16:36.461 --> 1:16:38.071
What are you looking at?

1:16:38.245 --> 1:16:41.074
A Harper shaking off
his slumber.

1:16:42.598 --> 1:16:43.599
Go, Holga!

1:16:48.342 --> 1:16:49.517
Again!

1:16:52.738 --> 1:16:53.565
Now!

1:17:32.517 --> 1:17:33.953
This is where I leave you.

1:17:34.127 --> 1:17:36.303
I wish you every success
on your journey.

1:17:38.479 --> 1:17:40.438
You'’re not coming?Would that I could.

1:17:40.612 --> 1:17:43.049
But this is your quest.

1:17:43.223 --> 1:17:46.574
I have given you the tools.
You must utilize them.

1:17:46.749 --> 1:17:48.402
Can'’t you utilize them for us?

1:17:48.576 --> 1:17:51.101
Because you'’re much better
at fighting and strategy and...

1:17:51.275 --> 1:17:53.669
Pretty much everything
but talking.

1:17:55.366 --> 1:17:56.497
Talking to you
isn'’t great.

1:17:56.672 --> 1:17:57.760
Mmm.

1:17:59.457 --> 1:18:02.765
In those instances where
faith wanes and doubt waxes,

1:18:02.939 --> 1:18:04.418
I recall
the Tenets of the Ancients...

1:18:04.592 --> 1:18:06.333
Okay. See you later.

1:18:21.914 --> 1:18:23.263
There he goes.

1:18:25.483 --> 1:18:27.093
Just wandering off.

1:18:28.616 --> 1:18:30.967
Walks in such a straight line.

1:18:32.142 --> 1:18:34.057
Uh-oh. Wait a minute.
He'’s coming up on a rock.

1:18:34.231 --> 1:18:36.407
Is he gonna go around?

1:18:36.581 --> 1:18:37.843
Nope.

1:18:38.017 --> 1:18:39.845
Right over the rock.

1:18:47.113 --> 1:18:48.854
What are you mumbling?

1:18:49.028 --> 1:18:51.161
I'’m preparing to attune.

1:18:51.335 --> 1:18:53.990
If I can'’t connect with it,
it'’ll be useless.

1:18:55.469 --> 1:18:58.211
That'’s a lot of pressure,
given all we went through
to get it.

1:18:58.385 --> 1:18:59.952
Yeah, I realize that.

1:19:02.041 --> 1:19:04.348
So our entire fate
rests on you.

1:19:05.044 --> 1:19:07.133
Come on.

1:19:30.113 --> 1:19:33.507
There he is,
the great Simon Aumar.

1:19:33.681 --> 1:19:36.597
Sorcerer descended
from wizarding blood.

1:19:36.772 --> 1:19:38.034
Who are you?

1:19:38.686 --> 1:19:40.166
Don'’t you know me?

1:19:41.820 --> 1:19:43.909
My name is Aumar too.

1:19:45.606 --> 1:19:46.999
You'’re my
great-great grandfather.

1:19:50.568 --> 1:19:52.657
That'’s quite a helm.

1:19:52.831 --> 1:19:55.616
What makes you think
you'’re worthy of it?

1:19:56.792 --> 1:19:58.445
I believe in myself?

1:19:58.619 --> 1:20:00.056
You'’re asking me?

1:20:00.230 --> 1:20:02.319
No, I'’m-- I'’m sure.

1:20:02.493 --> 1:20:04.103
I'’m a great sorcerer.

1:20:04.277 --> 1:20:05.626
Are you now?

1:20:06.627 --> 1:20:08.673
Funny thing about magic.

1:20:09.717 --> 1:20:12.068
It chooses who may wield it.

1:20:12.242 --> 1:20:14.548
And it does not
suffer fools.

1:20:14.722 --> 1:20:16.072
Why are you telling me this?

1:20:16.246 --> 1:20:19.336
I think you know, Simon.

1:20:24.036 --> 1:20:25.516
Did you attune with it?

1:20:25.690 --> 1:20:26.996
You okay?

1:20:27.474 --> 1:20:28.649
I got you.

1:20:29.912 --> 1:20:31.478
What happened?

1:20:31.652 --> 1:20:32.871
I, uh...

1:20:33.045 --> 1:20:35.134
-I spoke to someone.
-Yeah?

1:20:35.308 --> 1:20:37.180
My great-great grandfather.
He was...

1:20:38.224 --> 1:20:38.964
unhelpful.

1:20:39.138 --> 1:20:41.097
You spoke to him?

1:20:41.271 --> 1:20:43.839
From here, it looked like
the helmet flew off
the second you put it on.

1:20:44.013 --> 1:20:45.841
Well, time moves
differently there.

1:20:46.015 --> 1:20:47.843
Okay,
I'’ll try a different approach.

1:20:48.017 --> 1:20:50.019
Great. New approach. Try it.

1:20:51.629 --> 1:20:52.760
You got this.
You got this.

1:20:59.289 --> 1:21:01.465
You'’re getting better.
You didn'’t fly as far.

1:21:01.639 --> 1:21:03.032
Stick with it.

1:21:03.206 --> 1:21:04.772
We have six hours till
we leave for Neverwinter.

1:21:04.947 --> 1:21:06.818
You fail, I never
get my family back.

1:21:06.992 --> 1:21:08.080
Brilliant.

1:21:27.273 --> 1:21:29.449
I'’ve never seen
a bigger coward.

1:21:29.623 --> 1:21:32.061
Coward?
You'’re under here, too.

1:21:32.713 --> 1:21:33.932
Fine. I'’ll handle it.

1:21:34.106 --> 1:21:35.891
No, no, no.

1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:38.545
I'’ve got this.

1:21:40.852 --> 1:21:43.159
And you want
to be a Harper.

1:21:43.333 --> 1:21:44.595
Quiet!

1:21:48.991 --> 1:21:51.167
Oh, God. Damn.

1:21:51.776 --> 1:21:53.082
There it is.

1:21:54.605 --> 1:21:56.694
Stop trying to capture it.

1:22:00.916 --> 1:22:02.613
You just have to let it go.

1:22:04.049 --> 1:22:05.137
Ed!

1:22:06.138 --> 1:22:08.575
Ed! We'’ve got a problem.

1:22:08.749 --> 1:22:10.142
I can'’t do it.

1:22:11.187 --> 1:22:12.971
-The helmet?
-I'’ve been at it for hours!

1:22:13.145 --> 1:22:14.930
I can'’t get past
the old bastard!

1:22:15.104 --> 1:22:17.410
I said I couldn'’t attune.
Now I'’m the prat!

1:22:17.584 --> 1:22:19.108
What'’s the racket?

1:22:19.282 --> 1:22:21.458
He'’s having
a little trouble with the helm.

1:22:21.632 --> 1:22:23.721
Come on, Simon,
just do it.

1:22:23.895 --> 1:22:27.116
Oh. yeah, okay. Yeah.
Thanks, Holga. I'’ll just do it.

1:22:27.290 --> 1:22:30.075
This is exactly what I told you
would happen back at the tavern,

1:22:30.249 --> 1:22:33.078
but you wouldn'’t listen.What do you mean, you told him?

1:22:33.252 --> 1:22:35.167
He said to keep it
between us for morale.

1:22:35.341 --> 1:22:36.952
I--Do you know why?

1:22:37.126 --> 1:22:39.955
Because he is the most pigheaded
person I'’ve ever known!

1:22:40.129 --> 1:22:42.261
You talk us into doing things
you know won'’t work,

1:22:42.435 --> 1:22:44.481
and then you blame us
when it goes pear-shaped!

1:22:44.655 --> 1:22:46.918
If you can'’t attune,
we'’ll figure out a Plan B.

1:22:47.092 --> 1:22:48.659
Plan B?
We dug up my family.

1:22:48.833 --> 1:22:50.617
We went to the Underdark
for that helmet.

1:22:50.791 --> 1:22:53.142
And you knew the whole time
that he couldn'’t use it?

1:22:53.316 --> 1:22:55.100
You humans.
You just can'’t help but lie.

1:22:55.274 --> 1:22:57.973
I didn'’t lie.
I really thought
Simon could do it.

1:22:58.147 --> 1:23:01.063
Guys, look.
We got a couple hours
till the games begin.

1:23:01.237 --> 1:23:03.413
This is what we do.
We pivot.

1:23:03.587 --> 1:23:06.111
Instead of dwelling on
what went wrong
and who lied to whom,

1:23:06.285 --> 1:23:08.157
let'’s put our heads together
and figure out a plan!

1:23:08.331 --> 1:23:10.246
I'’m gonna figure out
my way home.

1:23:10.420 --> 1:23:12.509
I can'’t believe I put
my faith in any of you.

1:23:12.683 --> 1:23:15.468
Yeah, I'’m going too.
Sorry about Kira.

1:23:17.905 --> 1:23:20.473
We'’ll find another way
to get her. Just not today.

1:23:20.647 --> 1:23:23.694
It has to be today. We'’re not
done until my daughter'’s safe.

1:23:23.868 --> 1:23:25.043
Aren'’t you sick of failing?

1:23:25.217 --> 1:23:27.176
No! That'’s the whole point!

1:23:27.350 --> 1:23:31.571
We must never stop failing,
because the minute we do,
we'’ve failed.

1:23:32.398 --> 1:23:34.313
Huh?Look,

1:23:34.487 --> 1:23:38.535
none of us here can say
our lives have gone
the way we had hoped for.

1:23:39.101 --> 1:23:40.145
Right?

1:23:40.319 --> 1:23:41.712
Holga.

1:23:41.886 --> 1:23:43.844
You left your tribe
to be with a man

1:23:44.019 --> 1:23:47.587
who left you because you were
so upset about leaving
your tribe.

1:23:47.761 --> 1:23:50.068
And if you quit now,
that'’s in stone!

1:23:50.242 --> 1:23:52.114
Same with you, Simon.

1:23:52.288 --> 1:23:55.291
You'’re a petty thief
masquerading as
a pettier sorcerer.

1:23:55.465 --> 1:23:58.033
You gonna go back to your show?It'’s better than dying.

1:23:58.207 --> 1:23:59.817
There'’s worse things than dying.

1:23:59.991 --> 1:24:01.906
And, Doric, you have integrity,

1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:05.040
and I am sure the last thing
you want to do is tell
the Emerald Enclave

1:24:05.214 --> 1:24:07.564
that you had a chance to save
them but you walked away.

1:24:07.738 --> 1:24:10.436
Hey, You'’re quick
to call us failures.
What about you, Ed?

1:24:10.610 --> 1:24:14.136
Me? I'’m the champion
of failures!

1:24:14.310 --> 1:24:17.400
I lost everything
that ever mattered to me
and it was all my fault.

1:24:23.406 --> 1:24:25.625
You want to know who
really killed my wife?

1:24:28.498 --> 1:24:29.629
I did.

1:24:31.283 --> 1:24:34.547
I decided we deserved
a better life than
a Harper'’s oath would allow us.

1:24:37.072 --> 1:24:39.857
But I didn'’t know that
Red Wizards marked
their treasure.

1:24:42.555 --> 1:24:44.383
I led them right to our door.

1:24:46.994 --> 1:24:50.128
I didn'’t even have the good luck
to be home when they got there.

1:24:51.738 --> 1:24:54.741
I failed the Harpers,
I failed my family,
I failed all of you.

1:24:54.915 --> 1:24:56.787
Which is exactly why
I can'’t quit.

1:24:56.961 --> 1:24:59.659
So if you'’ll excuse me,
I'’m gonna go sit on this rock

1:25:00.617 --> 1:25:02.097
and make a plan.

1:25:14.848 --> 1:25:16.154
Move over.

1:25:51.581 --> 1:25:54.366
I'’d sit too, but there'’s
no more room on the rock.

1:25:56.847 --> 1:25:58.109
How about this?

1:25:59.415 --> 1:26:01.721
We use the Hither-Thither Staff
to get into the vault.

1:26:01.895 --> 1:26:03.462
No, I'’ve explained this.

1:26:03.636 --> 1:26:05.334
You can'’t Hither-Thither
into a room you can'’t see.

1:26:05.508 --> 1:26:06.944
I'’m not saying that.

1:26:07.118 --> 1:26:09.425
I'’m saying we put
the portal on something

1:26:09.599 --> 1:26:11.775
and then sneak that thing
into the vault.

1:26:11.949 --> 1:26:15.082
Mmm. The only thing going
in that vault is treasure.

1:26:15.257 --> 1:26:17.650
So we put the portal
on some treasure.

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.829
Forge did say the richest men
in Baldur'’s Gate and Waterdeep

1:26:23.003 --> 1:26:24.788
are bringing loot to the city.

1:26:25.789 --> 1:26:27.704
They'’ll be traveling
the High Road.

1:26:27.878 --> 1:26:30.141
We could catch
one of their convoys!There'’ll be dozens of guards.

1:26:30.315 --> 1:26:31.969
Yeah, but the guards will
be guarding against people

1:26:32.143 --> 1:26:34.972
taking things
out of their wagon,
not putting them in!

1:26:35.146 --> 1:26:37.409
Holga, I could kiss you!Try it.

1:26:42.197 --> 1:26:43.937
Perfect.
Thank you so much.

1:28:00.231 --> 1:28:01.450
Oh!

1:28:28.041 --> 1:28:29.086
Oh!

1:29:06.384 --> 1:29:11.215
What a profound joy
it is to welcome you,

1:29:11.389 --> 1:29:15.175
the good people of Neverwinter,
to the resumption

1:29:15.350 --> 1:29:18.004
of the High Sun Games!

1:29:21.878 --> 1:29:25.185
I guarantee that you are in for
the most riveting spectacle

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:27.362
on all the Sword Coast.

1:29:27.536 --> 1:29:29.799
The rules are very simple:

1:29:29.973 --> 1:29:33.977
Five harrowing challenges.
Five teams of champions.

1:29:34.151 --> 1:29:37.372
Whoever survives to reach
the Cage of Sanctuary

1:29:37.546 --> 1:29:40.462
moves on to the next stage.

1:29:41.288 --> 1:29:43.465
One thing: I do urge you,

1:29:43.639 --> 1:29:47.643
please do not leave the arena
till the close of the games,

1:29:47.817 --> 1:29:50.080
as there will be
a wonderful gift

1:29:50.254 --> 1:29:53.257
for each and every one of you!

1:29:58.871 --> 1:30:00.351
All right, take me down.

1:30:00.525 --> 1:30:02.614
This is absurdly high.
It'’s not what we discussed.

1:30:04.964 --> 1:30:07.227
Come on.
Gotta get it all done.

1:30:16.715 --> 1:30:18.674
Oh, no.What happened?

1:30:18.848 --> 1:30:21.503
It'’s facing the floor.
Why would they store it
that way?

1:30:28.161 --> 1:30:29.815
Damn it.Why does nothing
go our way?

1:30:29.989 --> 1:30:31.774
Let me try.
Maybe I can make a gap.

1:30:33.384 --> 1:30:34.907
The games have started.

1:30:36.213 --> 1:30:39.085
We'’re going to Plan C.Oh, bollocks. What'’s Plan C?

1:30:39.259 --> 1:30:41.653
Plan C is we go back
to Plan A.

1:30:41.827 --> 1:30:43.046
You'’re gonna attune
to the helmet.

1:30:43.220 --> 1:30:45.265
Why don'’t you
just call it Plan A?

1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:48.138
Plan A has a stink on it.You know damn well
I can'’t attune to the thing.

1:30:48.312 --> 1:30:50.619
That'’s not true!
You couldn'’t attune to it.

1:30:50.793 --> 1:30:53.012
Look at me.
Look at me! Huh?

1:30:53.186 --> 1:30:54.884
Do you remember that job
in Loudwater?

1:30:55.058 --> 1:30:58.017
You couldn'’t spider climb until
Jolym sicced his dog on you.

1:30:58.191 --> 1:31:00.150
And when we robbed
the spear of Aoth Fezim,

1:31:00.324 --> 1:31:03.240
your stoneskin spell failed
until the arrows were
inches away.

1:31:03.414 --> 1:31:07.026
Even in Triboar, you flipped
the gravity of a whole theater!

1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:08.245
You did?

1:31:09.333 --> 1:31:11.074
By accident.
It was wild magic,

1:31:11.248 --> 1:31:14.294
and that only happened
because they were gonna kill me.Exactly!

1:31:15.252 --> 1:31:17.515
Look, you are
at your strongest

1:31:17.689 --> 1:31:19.822
when you think
you'’re at your weakest.

1:31:19.996 --> 1:31:21.693
But you deliver.

1:31:23.434 --> 1:31:26.132
You'’re gonna get
into that vault, okay?

1:31:26.306 --> 1:31:27.830
Not because you can...

1:31:29.745 --> 1:31:30.963
but because you must.

1:31:31.834 --> 1:31:33.836
I'’m gonna keep chipping away.

1:31:34.010 --> 1:31:36.491
If I can get a quarter inch,
I'’ll be able to squeeze through
as a worm.

1:31:36.665 --> 1:31:37.883
As a worm!

1:31:38.057 --> 1:31:39.494
As a worm, perfect.

1:31:39.668 --> 1:31:41.670
You see this? Now we have
a Plan D if Plan C fails.

1:31:41.844 --> 1:31:43.672
Isn'’t Plan D
just Plan B again?

1:31:43.846 --> 1:31:46.936
Plan B has a stink too.It all stinks.

1:31:47.110 --> 1:31:49.547
Here. Use this
to keep in contact.

1:31:50.461 --> 1:31:52.071
Well, um, this is a rock.

1:31:52.245 --> 1:31:53.551
Actually it is...

1:31:53.725 --> 1:31:55.292
...a sending stone.

1:31:55.466 --> 1:31:56.946
But they'’ll only work
for an hour.

1:31:57.773 --> 1:31:59.296
Clever.

1:32:01.516 --> 1:32:03.126
So how we gonna
get in there?

1:32:03.300 --> 1:32:05.389
Easy.
We just create a distraction.

1:32:06.390 --> 1:32:08.697
Oh, I got a good feeling
about Plan C.

1:32:22.319 --> 1:32:24.060

1:33:28.515 --> 1:33:29.429
Halt!

1:33:37.133 --> 1:33:39.004
-There she is!
-Hold your weapons!

1:33:39.178 --> 1:33:40.789
I'’ll hold them.
Find the vault.

1:33:40.963 --> 1:33:43.269
You sure I can'’t help?I'’m certain.

1:33:43.443 --> 1:33:45.837
Mmm, you don'’t
have to be so certain.Get her!

1:34:17.826 --> 1:34:20.480
Now listen carefully.

1:34:20.655 --> 1:34:23.179
I'’m with the Absolution Council.
They'’ve just gone up.

1:34:44.679 --> 1:34:46.202
Go! Quickly!

1:35:06.396 --> 1:35:07.440
Open up!

1:35:07.614 --> 1:35:09.399
Just a minute!

1:35:29.245 --> 1:35:30.463
I don'’t mind that.

1:35:33.815 --> 1:35:35.294
Okay, you can do this.

1:35:35.468 --> 1:35:37.079
Relax. No rush.

1:35:37.253 --> 1:35:38.820
There he is!

1:35:42.432 --> 1:35:44.913
Look who'’s back.
The would-be sorcerer.

1:35:45.087 --> 1:35:48.525
I don'’t have time for this!Yet I have
all the time there is.

1:35:48.699 --> 1:35:51.049
You don'’t get it.
We'’re going to die
if I don'’t attune!

1:35:51.223 --> 1:35:54.183
So you die a fool.
It'’s better than to live as one.

1:35:54.357 --> 1:35:56.054
That'’s enough!
You don'’t know me.

1:35:56.228 --> 1:35:58.970
I know you'’re a stain
on your family name!

1:35:59.144 --> 1:36:01.016
To hell with my name!
Let me attune!

1:36:01.190 --> 1:36:03.540
Not while I live.You don'’t live!

1:36:03.714 --> 1:36:05.847
You had your time.
Now it'’s my turn.

1:36:06.021 --> 1:36:07.196
I won'’t allow it.

1:36:07.370 --> 1:36:08.675
I don'’t care!

1:36:10.590 --> 1:36:11.635
Sorry.

1:36:16.161 --> 1:36:17.336
Took you long enough.

1:36:33.657 --> 1:36:34.701
Simon!

1:36:36.181 --> 1:36:37.269
Simon, was that you?

1:36:37.443 --> 1:36:39.576
It was! I did it!

1:36:39.750 --> 1:36:40.969
Well done.

1:36:42.013 --> 1:36:43.754
I guess it was just me
holding me back.

1:36:43.928 --> 1:36:45.364
That'’s what I'’ve been saying!

1:36:54.243 --> 1:36:55.461
I made it inside the vault.

1:36:55.635 --> 1:36:57.289
So did we.

1:36:58.290 --> 1:36:59.988
There'’s nothing here.

1:37:00.162 --> 1:37:02.599
What do you mean?
It'’s all here. Where are you?

1:37:02.773 --> 1:37:03.818
Where are you?

1:37:04.601 --> 1:37:06.037
I think I'’m under the arena.

1:37:07.996 --> 1:37:08.953
Forge.

1:37:09.127 --> 1:37:10.476
This one here.

1:37:28.755 --> 1:37:30.235
Oh, that'’s not good.

1:37:38.722 --> 1:37:40.680
Simon! Doric! You there?

1:37:40.855 --> 1:37:42.378
What are you doing here?

1:37:43.292 --> 1:37:44.293
Kir!

1:37:46.469 --> 1:37:47.687
I came for you.

1:37:47.862 --> 1:37:49.254
We have to go.

1:37:50.168 --> 1:37:51.691
You left me.

1:37:51.866 --> 1:37:55.347
No. No, I know you think
I'’m a liar and a bad father,

1:37:55.521 --> 1:37:56.958
but--

1:38:00.352 --> 1:38:01.876
I am a bad father.

1:38:05.227 --> 1:38:07.011
And I did leave you.

1:38:07.185 --> 1:38:09.361
And I wasn'’t trying
to bring your mom back.

1:38:09.535 --> 1:38:10.972
I was trying to...

1:38:11.886 --> 1:38:13.583
bring my wife back.

1:38:14.889 --> 1:38:17.892
Which if-- maybe if you had
gotten a chance to know her

1:38:18.980 --> 1:38:21.417
and love her like I did,
you'’d understand.

1:38:21.591 --> 1:38:23.419
But if you come with me now,

1:38:24.333 --> 1:38:25.900
you can have that chance.

1:38:28.859 --> 1:38:29.773
Hmm.

1:38:48.096 --> 1:38:50.837
You'’d think you'’d be
able to distinguish between

1:38:51.012 --> 1:38:53.623
your own daughter
and a 300-year-old wizard.

1:38:53.797 --> 1:38:55.016
Don'’t worry, Kira'’s safe.

1:38:55.190 --> 1:38:56.974
Unlike me, she had no idea
you were coming.

1:38:57.148 --> 1:39:00.760
I don'’t think she knows how
tenacious you'’ve become. Huh?

1:39:02.284 --> 1:39:03.850
Look, Ed, um...

1:39:06.853 --> 1:39:09.465
I'’m really sorry
about the way things
have worked out.

1:39:10.466 --> 1:39:12.729
But I think if you were
truly honest,

1:39:12.903 --> 1:39:15.819
you'’d have to admit I can
give Kira a better life.

1:39:16.820 --> 1:39:18.430
I hope you can
take comfort in knowing

1:39:18.604 --> 1:39:20.737
that she'’s with the father
she deserves, yeah?

1:39:20.911 --> 1:39:23.566
And now I'’m in
a pickle because...

1:39:23.740 --> 1:39:25.655
...I don'’t want
to see you die.

1:39:26.917 --> 1:39:30.486
Which is why
I'’m gonna leave the room.

1:39:33.184 --> 1:39:34.142
What?

1:39:42.802 --> 1:39:45.283
If you'’re gonna kill us,
at least let us die
with dignity.

1:39:45.457 --> 1:39:48.460
How do you mean?Put us in the High Sun Games.

1:39:48.634 --> 1:39:51.028
Give us a fighting chance.That'’s not a chance.

1:39:51.202 --> 1:39:52.987
It'’s not a chance at all.

1:39:53.161 --> 1:39:56.077
I mean, even if you were
to somehow survive
the tournament,

1:39:56.251 --> 1:39:57.687
Sofina'’s gonna...

1:40:00.690 --> 1:40:03.998
It would be much, much better
for you to die here
than to go to the games.

1:40:04.172 --> 1:40:07.566
No. They defeated
your men and mine.

1:40:07.740 --> 1:40:09.394
Let them fight in the arena.

1:40:10.265 --> 1:40:12.223
They deserve that much.

1:40:14.617 --> 1:40:16.880
...to the games?

1:40:17.054 --> 1:40:20.275
Oh. Yeah.
That was sort of a bad day.

1:40:20.449 --> 1:40:21.493
Oh.

1:40:21.667 --> 1:40:23.191
You might want
to go back to sleep.

1:40:23.365 --> 1:40:24.540
Are we...

1:40:24.714 --> 1:40:26.716
In the arena.

1:40:28.587 --> 1:40:31.242
This dummy talked Forge into
putting us in the games.

1:40:31.416 --> 1:40:33.114
Dummy? I saved our lives!

1:40:33.288 --> 1:40:35.116
And I got us right above where
Doric said the treasure was.

1:40:35.290 --> 1:40:37.770
Isn'’t it a little suspect
that Sofina would agree to this?

1:40:37.944 --> 1:40:40.817
Yeah, she'’s definitely
planned something.

1:40:40.991 --> 1:40:42.732
Where under the arena
were you?

1:40:43.428 --> 1:40:44.777
Do you remember?

1:40:45.561 --> 1:40:46.649
Not sure.

1:40:47.998 --> 1:40:49.739
There was a dock down there.

1:40:49.913 --> 1:40:52.742
I saw guards loading
everything onto a ship.

1:40:54.657 --> 1:40:58.443
A ship. Forge wasn'’t hiding
the loot from us.

1:40:58.617 --> 1:41:00.576
He was stealing it
for himself.

1:41:00.750 --> 1:41:03.622
He never cared about being Lord.
That just gave him access
to the vault.

1:41:03.796 --> 1:41:06.277
He must have brought back
the games so the take
would be bigger.

1:41:07.931 --> 1:41:12.501
What about Kira?He won'’t leave her behind.
We have to get to that boat.

1:41:12.675 --> 1:41:16.461
I don'’t understand.
If Forge is leaving, what does
Sofina get out of this?

1:41:24.948 --> 1:41:26.776
Maybe I can
get us out of here.

1:41:30.214 --> 1:41:33.261
Magic suppression cuff.
They put one on me too.

1:41:33.435 --> 1:41:35.480
And just when you were
getting good at it.

1:42:36.237 --> 1:42:38.064
So we just
go through the maze?

1:42:38.239 --> 1:42:40.154
I guess till
we reach the cage?

1:42:46.290 --> 1:42:47.291
Run!

1:42:51.991 --> 1:42:53.167
Find the cage!

1:43:02.567 --> 1:43:03.655
Follow me!

1:43:13.796 --> 1:43:14.840
Whoa, whoa!

1:43:59.233 --> 1:44:00.495
Thanks.

1:44:03.193 --> 1:44:05.587
-Where are the others?
-Come on, this way.

1:44:10.940 --> 1:44:13.334
Have you tried
Displacer Beast meat?

1:44:14.073 --> 1:44:15.858
No. It'’s too gamey for me.

1:44:17.860 --> 1:44:19.514
The ship is ready, sir.

1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:28.523
It seems my ship
is ready, so...

1:44:29.524 --> 1:44:32.048
Kira and I will
be taking our leave.

1:44:34.180 --> 1:44:38.359
I do hope that our collaboration
has been as gratifying for you
as it has for--

1:44:38.533 --> 1:44:40.491
Get out of my city.

1:44:40.665 --> 1:44:41.884
Right.

1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:47.411
Get out of the way!

1:44:48.238 --> 1:44:49.413
It'’s burning!

1:44:55.027 --> 1:44:57.029
Another minute,
I would have lost my hand.

1:44:57.203 --> 1:44:58.814
Yeah, but look what
you did lose.

1:44:59.554 --> 1:45:00.511
Come on.

1:45:00.685 --> 1:45:02.470
Doric? Doric!

1:45:02.644 --> 1:45:04.776
There must be a way
to get out of the arena.

1:45:22.185 --> 1:45:23.534
Come on! Come on!

1:45:34.328 --> 1:45:35.459
Yeah. Come on!

1:45:37.243 --> 1:45:38.941
No.

1:45:39.115 --> 1:45:41.204
No, this isn'’t the way out.

1:45:41.378 --> 1:45:43.598
Yes, it is.If we survive this, there'’ll be
another challenge and another

1:45:43.772 --> 1:45:45.730
until every last person
in that cage is dead.

1:45:45.904 --> 1:45:47.732
We have to find a work-around.

1:45:50.126 --> 1:45:52.215
I'’ve got an idea. Follow me.

1:45:52.389 --> 1:45:53.695
No! Come back!

1:45:53.869 --> 1:45:56.132
Hey! What'’s your idea?

1:46:03.487 --> 1:46:05.097
When we hear the gong,
we jump in.

1:46:05.271 --> 1:46:06.490
Into this thing?

1:46:06.664 --> 1:46:08.536
You want to end up
like that guy?

1:46:08.710 --> 1:46:10.886
We will only be inside
for a few seconds.

1:46:14.324 --> 1:46:16.413
Well, If we'’re all inside,
who'’s gonna pull us out?

1:46:16.587 --> 1:46:18.589
-I will, trust me.
-Always.

1:46:18.763 --> 1:46:20.069
Hold.

1:46:23.289 --> 1:46:24.726
Hold.

1:46:26.771 --> 1:46:27.816
Hold!

1:46:27.990 --> 1:46:30.079
Now!

1:47:03.460 --> 1:47:05.506
Damn it! That stings!

1:47:16.386 --> 1:47:18.823
We got to move.

1:47:27.179 --> 1:47:28.398
I'’ve been here.

1:47:29.051 --> 1:47:30.356
Our gear.

1:47:33.621 --> 1:47:35.927
Simon. Try these
on your cuff.

1:47:38.277 --> 1:47:39.627
Come with me.

1:47:41.237 --> 1:47:43.152
Quite a second date,
yeah?

1:47:57.166 --> 1:47:59.081
-A trip?
-Yes.

1:47:59.255 --> 1:48:01.387
Something urgent has come up,
but if we leave now
we'’ll be safe.

1:48:01.562 --> 1:48:02.563
Safe from what?

1:48:04.782 --> 1:48:07.306
What is this?This is an ambush.

1:48:07.481 --> 1:48:09.700
On the boat you were gonna use
to escape from Neverwinter.

1:48:09.874 --> 1:48:11.310
Dad.Hi, honey.

1:48:11.485 --> 1:48:13.791
Hey, Forge, why don'’t you
tell her what this is?

1:48:15.314 --> 1:48:18.187
I don'’t know.It'’s the Tablet of Reawakening,
Kira.

1:48:18.361 --> 1:48:20.276
It'’s the reason why
I left you.

1:48:20.450 --> 1:48:22.408
Your dad'’s been
telling you the truth, Bug.

1:48:22.583 --> 1:48:25.063
It'’s Uncle Forge
who'’s been feeding you lies.

1:48:26.891 --> 1:48:29.198
It'’s rubbish.
It'’s just rubbish!

1:48:29.372 --> 1:48:30.852
Come with me, Kir.

1:48:31.809 --> 1:48:34.072
We'’ll go home,
bring back Mom.

1:48:35.247 --> 1:48:37.206
We can be a family again.

1:48:40.905 --> 1:48:42.211
You'’re not taking my money.

1:48:44.082 --> 1:48:46.432
Put down the tablet and get off
my ship, all of you.

1:48:46.607 --> 1:48:48.652
Now!Okay. Okay. Okay.

1:48:48.826 --> 1:48:50.175
What are you doing?

1:48:50.349 --> 1:48:51.699
It'’s all right.
Shush, my darling, be quiet.

1:48:51.873 --> 1:48:53.570
It'’s going down.
Just don'’t hurt her.

1:48:53.744 --> 1:48:55.137
See that, Kira?

1:48:55.311 --> 1:48:57.269
Your father knows me.

1:48:57.443 --> 1:49:00.490
He knows I'’m prepared
to do terrible things

1:49:00.664 --> 1:49:02.057
to get what I want.

1:49:02.884 --> 1:49:05.582
Even to those I care about most.

1:49:07.366 --> 1:49:10.848
In the end, that'’s all
that separates the beggar--

1:49:23.774 --> 1:49:25.559
Nobody hurts my Bug.

1:49:27.604 --> 1:49:29.171
Simon, get us out of here!

1:49:36.657 --> 1:49:38.049
Sorry, Ed.

1:49:43.098 --> 1:49:44.403
Sorry, Forge!

1:49:59.027 --> 1:50:00.681
What'’s that one on about?Who knows?

1:50:00.855 --> 1:50:02.508
Twenty thousand
on the Gray Hands!

1:50:08.645 --> 1:50:10.342
I'’m sorry I believed him.

1:50:11.779 --> 1:50:13.650
What? What are you
talking about?

1:50:13.824 --> 1:50:16.784
You have nothing
to apologize for.

1:50:16.958 --> 1:50:19.874
I should have done
so many things differently.

1:50:21.179 --> 1:50:24.443
I had a whole apology,
but I sort of gave it to Sofina.

1:50:25.793 --> 1:50:27.838
I love you, Kir.

1:50:28.012 --> 1:50:31.189
And nothing will ever
get in the way
of that again, okay?

1:50:31.712 --> 1:50:32.713
Promise.

1:50:38.153 --> 1:50:40.329
I love you too, Dad.

1:50:40.503 --> 1:50:42.940
It'’s good to have you back, kid.

1:50:43.114 --> 1:50:45.943
Do you know how much loot
is on this ship?

1:50:47.815 --> 1:50:49.077
I'’m surprised
the boat can float.

1:50:49.251 --> 1:50:52.384
All right. So, we'’re gonna
need to lay low.

1:50:53.037 --> 1:50:54.517
What is that?

1:51:07.443 --> 1:51:09.358
It'’s the Beckoning Death.

1:51:09.532 --> 1:51:11.882
That'’s why
she needed Forge.

1:51:12.056 --> 1:51:14.668
The games brought the city
together for the spell.

1:51:15.581 --> 1:51:17.888
Szass Tam
is taking Neverwinter.

1:51:27.550 --> 1:51:29.421
Well, shit.

1:51:38.517 --> 1:51:40.519
So what do we do
when we get there?

1:51:40.694 --> 1:51:44.045
Working on it. Simon,
what did you say the range was
in that portal staff?

1:51:44.219 --> 1:51:46.047
A quarter mile. Why?

1:51:47.178 --> 1:51:49.920
I'’m gonna keep that promise
I made to Xenk.

1:51:58.537 --> 1:52:00.670
Whatever that is,
stop it. Now!

1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:06.110
Look! She'’s Thayan!

1:52:08.460 --> 1:52:10.245
Please! Please stop!

1:52:31.527 --> 1:52:34.486
You there! Harbor master person.Are you seeing this?

1:52:34.660 --> 1:52:37.228
As Lord of Neverwinter,
I demand a ship and crew

1:52:37.402 --> 1:52:39.578
to chase down
five people who have--

1:52:46.324 --> 1:52:48.500
What is this? No!

1:52:58.815 --> 1:53:01.035
It'’s the gift
Forge promised!

1:53:20.402 --> 1:53:22.099
No! No! No!

1:53:22.273 --> 1:53:24.798
No, no, no! No! No!

1:53:24.972 --> 1:53:26.800
No!

1:53:28.497 --> 1:53:30.281
That'’s for you.
Enjoy that.

1:53:31.152 --> 1:53:32.153
All right.

1:53:33.154 --> 1:53:35.069
This isn'’t over until
we take her out.

1:53:36.026 --> 1:53:38.420
Whatever happens to us,
stay hidden.

1:53:39.073 --> 1:53:40.335
Use your pendant.

1:53:51.172 --> 1:53:53.000
Where do you think
she'’s gone?

1:54:32.691 --> 1:54:33.997
She missed.

1:55:49.159 --> 1:55:50.378
You all right?

1:56:08.222 --> 1:56:09.788
What do we do
when we get to her?

1:56:09.963 --> 1:56:11.181
I got this.

1:57:16.333 --> 1:57:18.596
You know not
the scope of my power!

1:57:35.483 --> 1:57:37.137
Enough!

1:57:40.270 --> 1:57:42.011
It'’s another Time Stop!

1:57:42.185 --> 1:57:45.232
Simon, can you counter it?I can'’t. She'’s still too strong!

1:57:45.884 --> 1:57:47.147
I'’m so sorr--

1:57:51.455 --> 1:57:53.240
For too long

1:57:53.414 --> 1:57:56.721
I endured the arrogance
of Forge Fitzwilliam.

1:57:56.895 --> 1:57:58.767
The false charm.

1:57:58.941 --> 1:58:01.204
The quips.

1:58:01.378 --> 1:58:04.077
And just as I begin
to purge this place

1:58:04.251 --> 1:58:08.385
of its living filth,
you dare interpose.

1:58:12.128 --> 1:58:15.392
Now, as you die,

1:58:15.566 --> 1:58:18.003
rest assured
it will not be the end.

1:58:18.787 --> 1:58:23.357
For you will forever suffer.

1:58:25.663 --> 1:58:29.102
I'’m sorry, your breath
just smells like... old clothes.

1:58:29.276 --> 1:58:30.712
It'’s bad.

1:58:35.543 --> 1:58:36.761
What is this?

1:58:36.935 --> 1:58:39.721
I countered your Time Stop.
I got better.

1:58:39.895 --> 1:58:42.680
We had to distract you
so Kira could slap on that cuff

1:58:42.854 --> 1:58:44.682
and so Doric could do this.

1:58:50.862 --> 1:58:52.516
I think you got her.

1:59:05.094 --> 1:59:07.879
I honestly didn'’t think
that plan was gonna work.

1:59:08.576 --> 1:59:10.317
You assured us it would.

1:59:10.491 --> 1:59:12.188
Hey, Holga!

1:59:16.105 --> 1:59:18.063
Did we get her?Holga?

1:59:19.021 --> 1:59:21.980
Yeah.
Yeah, we got her.

1:59:22.807 --> 1:59:24.113
Oh, that'’s...Oh, God.

1:59:24.287 --> 1:59:25.636
That'’s not a good spot, is it?

1:59:25.810 --> 1:59:27.812
No, it'’s not--
it'’s not bad.

1:59:28.987 --> 1:59:29.901
Here.

1:59:30.075 --> 1:59:32.121
Simon! Simon, help her.

1:59:33.383 --> 1:59:36.734
It'’s a Red Wizard'’s blade.
There'’s nothing I can do.

1:59:39.346 --> 1:59:41.043
Hey. Hey.

1:59:41.217 --> 1:59:42.784
We'’re gonna patch you up.
It'’s not gonna be a problem.

1:59:42.958 --> 1:59:44.133
Please don'’t go.

1:59:45.090 --> 1:59:46.831
Easy, Bug, easy.Please don'’t go.

1:59:47.005 --> 1:59:48.224
Don'’t mourn me.

1:59:48.398 --> 1:59:50.444
No, no, no. No final words.

1:59:50.618 --> 1:59:53.142
No final words.I'’m proud of what I did here.

1:59:53.316 --> 1:59:55.405
I'’m dying a hero.

1:59:56.711 --> 1:59:58.321
And you...

2:00:00.367 --> 2:00:01.846
You'’re a good man.

2:00:02.499 --> 2:00:04.022
A real Harper.

2:00:05.023 --> 2:00:07.200
Shut up. I'’m a moron,
you know that.

2:00:07.852 --> 2:00:09.332
Promise me something.

2:00:10.159 --> 2:00:11.595
Yeah, anything.

2:00:11.769 --> 2:00:14.424
That you'’re gonna take
good care of our girl.

2:00:15.773 --> 2:00:18.211
She'’s the best thing
you ever did.

2:00:19.995 --> 2:00:21.431
I will.

2:00:24.217 --> 2:00:28.438

2:00:28.612 --> 2:00:32.225

No.

2:00:52.854 --> 2:00:54.072
No!

2:00:55.160 --> 2:00:56.901
I need you.

2:00:59.034 --> 2:01:01.515
I need you.

2:01:58.267 --> 2:02:00.617
We can only use it once.

2:02:04.099 --> 2:02:05.143
I know.

2:02:13.804 --> 2:02:14.936
Holga Kilgore.

2:02:31.735 --> 2:02:34.521
Don'’t tell me
you wasted it on me.

2:02:36.261 --> 2:02:37.785
Why would you do that?

2:03:00.285 --> 2:03:02.853
Szass Tam won'’t
be happy about this.

2:03:03.027 --> 2:03:04.725
Well, if he comes after us,
we'’ll be ready.

2:03:04.899 --> 2:03:06.553
We?

2:03:06.727 --> 2:03:08.685
Oh, that'’s right.
You don'’t like humans,
do you?

2:03:10.992 --> 2:03:12.123
Some are okay.

2:03:13.951 --> 2:03:15.562
What about you?Hmm?

2:03:15.736 --> 2:03:18.608
Going back to the Harpers?
Be with your people?

2:03:20.305 --> 2:03:21.916
I'’m with my people.

2:03:24.092 --> 2:03:25.833
So, uh,

2:03:26.007 --> 2:03:30.228
I know my last attempt
to court you was
quite bad.

2:03:30.403 --> 2:03:34.102
But I wonder if you'’d consider
having another go at it?

2:03:36.713 --> 2:03:37.845
Yeah, all right.Yeah?

2:03:38.019 --> 2:03:39.760
Calm down.Right.

2:03:47.768 --> 2:03:50.161
Damn! Bloody chalice.

2:04:08.745 --> 2:04:10.051
Good evening.

2:04:11.574 --> 2:04:13.837
Of course, you know
what happened after that.

2:04:14.011 --> 2:04:15.926
With Sofina'’s magic expunged,

2:04:16.100 --> 2:04:18.059
Lord Neverember
finally came to.

2:04:20.235 --> 2:04:22.237
His first official act
was to award

2:04:22.411 --> 2:04:25.370
the saviors of Neverwinter
the Medal of Heroism.

2:04:26.415 --> 2:04:28.112
And to the Emerald Enclave,

2:04:28.286 --> 2:04:31.768
he granted formal protection
of their people and their land.

2:04:38.340 --> 2:04:41.212
One could argue that my actions,
reprehensible though they were,

2:04:41.386 --> 2:04:43.998
led to a virtual renaissance
for the city.

2:04:44.172 --> 2:04:47.567
And while I'’ve only served
the first year of my sentence,
I have to say,

2:04:47.741 --> 2:04:49.003
it has been

2:04:50.134 --> 2:04:51.484
eye-opening.

2:04:52.572 --> 2:04:55.052
I have taken a look inside

2:04:55.749 --> 2:04:57.402
and I'’ve asked myself,

2:04:58.447 --> 2:04:59.840
"What'’s going on in there?"

2:05:01.189 --> 2:05:06.411
And, you know, I realized
a lot of it goes back to my mum.

2:05:07.674 --> 2:05:10.241
She was a stern woman,
prone to fits of--

2:05:10.415 --> 2:05:12.505
Stop, stop!
We'’ve heard enough.

2:05:14.245 --> 2:05:16.117
Pardon denied.

2:05:16.291 --> 2:05:18.728
This session
is adjourned.

2:05:23.646 --> 2:05:24.647
Jarnathan!

2:05:30.261 --> 2:05:32.394
No, no! I'’m terribly sorry.

2:05:32.568 --> 2:05:35.484
I don'’t know what came over me,
I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry!

2:07:47.311 --> 2:07:48.486
Hello?

2:07:50.097 --> 2:07:53.143
Can somebody please
ask me another question?

2:07:54.579 --> 2:07:55.624
Anyone?
