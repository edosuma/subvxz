WEBVTT

00:07.887 --> 00:09.218
Uh, could you give us
a second?

00:09.219 --> 00:10.992
The Skitters must have
changed the frequency

00:11.026 --> 00:13.327
that they're using
for communications again.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.193
When we find the right signal,
with any luck,

00:15.227 --> 00:17.326
we should be able to stop
the Skitters and Mechs,

00:17.360 --> 00:18.626
well,
right in their tracks.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.894
Hey.
I'm glad you're here.

00:20.928 --> 00:23.126
Ben says that when
he hears the signal, it hurts.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.794
After everything
he's been through,

00:24.828 --> 00:26.366
I don't want to make it
any worse.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.202
I wish I could tell you
what the effects might be,

00:29.236 --> 00:31.038
but we're
in new territory.

00:31.072 --> 00:33.273
Sounds like you think Scott's jamming
idea might actually work.

00:33.308 --> 00:34.942
Well, he's hopeful.

00:34.977 --> 00:37.914
Hail Mary passes seem to be
the order of the day.

00:37.949 --> 00:41.184
Setting gun positions
and barricades

00:41.219 --> 00:43.087
and coming up
with an evacuation plan --

00:43.122 --> 00:46.858
it's a long way
from the lecture hall.

00:46.892 --> 00:50.196
Tom, I know you're worried
about Hal, but he's smart.

00:50.231 --> 00:52.966
If Weaver's mission isn't right,
he'll back off.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.269
Oh, he's 16 and he's hurting
and he wants payback.

00:55.303 --> 00:57.237
He's gonna see this through,
if he can.

00:57.272 --> 00:59.273
How can you be sure?

00:59.307 --> 01:00.541
Because <i>I</i> would.

01:02.076 --> 01:03.943
No, if Weaver
sticks to Porter's timeline,

01:03.978 --> 01:05.379
they'll go in
just after dark.

01:05.413 --> 01:06.846
That's eight hours.

01:06.881 --> 01:08.247
I just want to
get through this day.

01:08.282 --> 01:09.916
Oh, for love of --

01:09.950 --> 01:12.017
the generator
must have run out of gas.

01:12.051 --> 01:13.752
I told those kids
at the motor pool

01:13.786 --> 01:15.152
to make sure
it was full up.

01:15.186 --> 01:16.753
I think there's a spare can
in the store room.

01:16.788 --> 01:18.221
Ben, you want to
give me a hand?

01:18.255 --> 01:21.023
Yeah, sure.

01:23.294 --> 01:24.994
I-I'm gonna head back
to the clinic,

01:25.029 --> 01:26.062
unless you need me.

01:26.097 --> 01:27.931
No, no.
I'm good. I'm good.

01:27.966 --> 01:29.966
Thanks.

Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:09.037 --> 02:10.905
You want to take it easy
with the bumps, man?

02:10.940 --> 02:12.674
I mean, we're not hauling
<i>mattresses</i> back here.

02:12.708 --> 02:16.210
We're not hauling nitro
through the Andes, either.

02:16.244 --> 02:20.714
"Wages of Fear."
Never saw it? Great movie.

02:20.748 --> 02:22.983
Anyway, it's gonna take a little
bit more than a few potholes

02:23.017 --> 02:24.451
to set these boomers off.

02:24.485 --> 02:27.321
Look, I'm not worried about
the anfo bombs, okay, genius?

02:27.355 --> 02:29.990
I'm worried about...
That.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.191
A loaded RPG should not
be back here with us.

02:31.226 --> 02:32.960
Stop wringing your hands,
will you?

02:32.994 --> 02:34.194
Safety's on.

02:34.228 --> 02:36.362
I think.

02:39.232 --> 02:40.833
Are you serious?

02:40.867 --> 02:42.000
Boom!

02:42.035 --> 02:43.669
You're a nutbag, man,
you know that?

02:49.809 --> 02:51.410
Okay!

02:51.445 --> 02:54.146
Okay, right there.
Whoa!

02:54.181 --> 02:56.482
Let's go!

02:56.517 --> 02:58.117
Check out the intersection!

02:58.152 --> 03:01.153
Drive out two klicks and see
if the roads are clear!

03:01.188 --> 03:03.089
Yes, sir.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.225
We've been lucky so far.

03:06.259 --> 03:09.795
So far today
or so far this year?

03:09.829 --> 03:11.096
Today.

03:11.130 --> 03:12.997
Skitters must be concentrating
their forces

03:13.032 --> 03:15.199
on the main highways,
but that could change.

03:22.974 --> 03:25.209
How much did your father
tell you?

03:25.243 --> 03:27.812
There aren't a whole lot
of secrets between us.

03:27.846 --> 03:30.147
And you still
took the mission?

03:32.017 --> 03:33.684
Said you quit
taking pills.

03:33.718 --> 03:35.519
That was
good enough for me.

03:37.323 --> 03:40.391
Still wondering
why I came.

03:40.425 --> 03:43.027
Am I?

03:43.061 --> 03:45.163
I just remember
my dad telling me

03:45.197 --> 03:47.832
about the day
after Pearl Harbor was bombed,

03:47.866 --> 03:50.769
how thousands of guys,
some of them as young as me,

03:50.803 --> 03:53.271
came flooding into
the recruiting offices.

03:53.306 --> 03:54.906
There was absolutely no way

03:54.940 --> 03:56.408
they knew how long
that war would last

03:56.442 --> 03:57.943
or how hard it would be,

03:57.977 --> 04:01.480
but they just knew
they had to fight back.

04:01.514 --> 04:03.849
Like father,
like son, huh?

04:03.883 --> 04:06.118
Always with
the history lesson.

04:06.152 --> 04:07.686
But you do know
this is different, right?

04:07.720 --> 04:09.254
Our enemies
aren't like us.

04:09.289 --> 04:10.956
They don't make
the same mistakes we do.

04:10.990 --> 04:13.191
They haven't
missed a beat yet.

04:15.060 --> 04:18.029
I'd say
they've missed one.

04:23.235 --> 04:26.237
All clear! Let's move.

04:38.183 --> 04:39.817
He was lying
next to the transmitter.

04:39.851 --> 04:41.085
Somebody
had broken into it.

04:41.119 --> 04:42.720
I saw the blood
and got Dr. Glass.

04:42.754 --> 04:45.289
It's okay, Ben.
You did the right thing.

04:45.323 --> 04:46.890
Aah! Ow!

04:46.925 --> 04:48.759
Don't be such a baby.

04:48.793 --> 04:52.162
I thought the physician's creed
was "First, do no harm."

04:52.196 --> 04:54.864
Oh, Tom, Tom.
Glad you're here.

04:54.898 --> 04:57.967
It was Rick,
wasn't it?

04:58.001 --> 05:00.102
- He's right.
- How did you know it was him?

05:00.137 --> 05:01.937
I...

05:01.972 --> 05:03.705
I-I just did.

05:03.740 --> 05:05.007
Rick was hanging from the --
the ceiling

05:05.041 --> 05:06.075
like some crazy bat.

05:06.109 --> 05:07.377
Don't --
don't ask me how.

05:07.411 --> 05:08.811
And he must have
been there awhile

05:08.846 --> 05:10.714
because he knew
exactly what to take

05:10.748 --> 05:12.382
in order to knock out
the transmitter.

05:12.417 --> 05:13.884
Are you done yet?
No.

05:13.918 --> 05:15.920
Aah. Ow!

05:15.954 --> 05:18.223
We knew Rick was troubled,
but sabotage?

05:18.257 --> 05:19.791
Attacking Scott?

05:19.826 --> 05:22.994
I guess whatever the harness did
isn't going away.

05:23.028 --> 05:25.197
All right,
we need to find him.

05:31.538 --> 05:35.374
Rick? Rick, are you here?

05:35.408 --> 05:37.476
I knew you were coming.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.745
Why did you hurt Scott?

05:39.779 --> 05:42.782
To get this.
To stop him.

05:42.816 --> 05:45.018
No, friend,
you remember?

05:45.052 --> 05:47.320
He's trying to
keep them away.

05:47.355 --> 05:51.392
If you give back the part,
they'll forgive you.

05:51.426 --> 05:53.761
They know you're confused
because of the harness.

05:53.795 --> 05:56.064
It's okay, Ben.

05:56.098 --> 05:58.133
I know
you can hear them, too.

05:58.167 --> 06:01.303
I want them
out of my head.

06:01.337 --> 06:03.672
Why?

06:03.706 --> 06:07.275
Ben, they're better
than the humans.

06:07.309 --> 06:11.078
We can be a part of that.
Ben?

06:14.182 --> 06:16.483
I want the harness back,
Ben.

06:16.518 --> 06:19.687
What?

06:19.721 --> 06:22.189
I can tell you want it,
too.

06:24.059 --> 06:28.362
Come with me.
We'll find them.

06:28.397 --> 06:32.200
We'll find them together.

06:34.070 --> 06:35.236
Help!

06:35.271 --> 06:36.939
Help!
It's okay, Ben. I'll find them.

06:36.973 --> 06:38.707
- Get my dad!
- And I'm gonna bring them back.

06:38.742 --> 06:42.378
Hey, where's Tom?!
Somebody get Tom!

06:44.949 --> 06:47.150
He's going to
warn the Skitters!

06:47.184 --> 06:48.785
Don't let him get away!

06:48.820 --> 06:51.354
He's gonna warn the Skitters!
Stop him! Stop him!

06:56.126 --> 06:57.260
Rick!

06:57.294 --> 06:59.095
Rick!

07:04.402 --> 07:06.871
Damn coat racks
are gonna give us up!

07:06.905 --> 07:08.506
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

07:09.709 --> 07:10.942
Don't shoot!

07:11.811 --> 07:15.014
Don't you ever
raise a gun to my son!

07:15.048 --> 07:17.917
Aliens figure out we're here,
we're dead.

07:17.952 --> 07:21.021
Why don't you save your ammo
for them and not these kids?!

07:21.055 --> 07:22.823
I was just trying to...
I know, I know.

07:22.857 --> 07:24.958
These people,
they're just scared.

07:24.992 --> 07:26.793
I want you to go back inside and find
Dr. Glass and stay with her, okay?

07:26.827 --> 07:29.228
- You going after Rick?
- Yeah.

07:29.263 --> 07:32.365
I'll try to bring him back.
You got this?

07:33.934 --> 07:35.601
Just make sure
you come back.

07:54.052 --> 07:57.755
Rick.

07:57.790 --> 07:59.390
We've been
trying to hear you,

07:59.425 --> 08:01.259
but it's been
really difficult.

08:01.293 --> 08:03.028
I know.

08:03.062 --> 08:05.230
It's 'cause
they took the harness off.

08:05.264 --> 08:07.299
We know. It's terrible!

08:07.333 --> 08:09.602
They just don't understand,
do they?

08:11.171 --> 08:15.442
I want to come back
and be like them, like you.

08:15.476 --> 08:17.110
Of course you do.

08:17.145 --> 08:18.912
But first you have
to tell us everything

08:18.947 --> 08:21.148
about the people
you've been with.

08:21.182 --> 08:23.250
Okay.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.052
Okay.

08:47.691 --> 08:49.096
No, wait!

08:49.097 --> 08:54.401
Please, I told you all I know!
All I want to do is come back!

08:54.436 --> 08:56.838
Please! Please!

08:59.241 --> 09:03.178
Rick, who are you talking to
out here?

09:03.212 --> 09:06.047
She...She left me.

09:06.082 --> 09:09.450
- They left me.
- Who?

09:09.485 --> 09:12.687
I only wanted to be with them,
but they didn't care.

09:12.721 --> 09:16.289
Rick, are there Skitters
near here?

09:16.324 --> 09:17.557
I'm not one of them.

09:17.592 --> 09:21.260
I'm not one of you.

09:21.294 --> 09:25.130
I don't want to
live like this anymore.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.500
Go ahead. Why not?
Shoot me.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.337
What?

09:31.371 --> 09:33.039
Isn't that w-why you --

09:33.073 --> 09:35.441
isn't that why you followed me
here, Tom, to kill me?

09:35.476 --> 09:38.444
No.
I came to take you home.

09:42.183 --> 09:45.251
But I really miss my dad.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.023
Okay, we got to go.

09:51.057 --> 09:53.391
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.193
You didn't ask for this.
Nobody asked for this.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.597
No, I'm sorry about --
I thought they loved me.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.933
All they wanted
was information.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.571
Rick,
what did you tell them?

10:09.141 --> 10:10.809
I told them
everything --

10:10.844 --> 10:15.415
the school, Weaver, you.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.519
Everything.

10:20.021 --> 10:21.389
Let's go.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.351
Circle up!

10:57.260 --> 11:01.464
If the 4th and 5th had made it
to their set point,

11:01.498 --> 11:05.368
their runners
were supposed to meet us here.

11:05.402 --> 11:08.372
We're gonna have to assume
that they've been taken out.

11:10.641 --> 11:14.211
Meaning we got two choices --

11:14.245 --> 11:18.082
retreat or keep going.

11:18.117 --> 11:22.019
Now, you men know how I feel.

11:22.054 --> 11:25.223
But each of you has to make
your own decision.

11:30.698 --> 11:32.365
I'm in.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.400
So am I!

11:37.539 --> 11:39.640
I'm in!
I'm in, too!

11:41.543 --> 11:44.412
Okay.

11:44.446 --> 11:46.247
We split up here.

11:46.282 --> 11:51.218
Each of the four squads,
four separate charges --

11:51.252 --> 11:52.753
one for each leg
of that damned thing.

11:52.787 --> 11:56.122
Squad one -- north leg.
Yes, sir.

11:56.156 --> 11:58.057
Two -- east.
Roger that.

11:58.091 --> 11:59.625
Three -- south leg.

11:59.659 --> 12:02.661
I'll stay here
and take the west leg.

12:02.695 --> 12:05.597
At 1900 hours,
I'll send Hal and Anthony

12:05.631 --> 12:07.632
to recon with the other squads.

12:07.667 --> 12:10.469
Everybody's in place,
we wait until dark,

12:10.503 --> 12:13.172
move in, position our charges.

12:13.206 --> 12:17.243
At exactly 2100 hours,

12:17.277 --> 12:20.547
we light those fuses
and get the hell out.

12:20.581 --> 12:24.251
Pope, those bombs of yours
had better be good to go.

12:24.286 --> 12:27.589
You get 'em there,
they'll blow.

12:27.623 --> 12:31.625
Everybody's gonna be on foot
after that.

12:31.660 --> 12:34.428
Each squad's gonna have to make
its way back to the school

12:34.462 --> 12:36.797
any way you can.

12:36.831 --> 12:38.364
That's it.

12:38.399 --> 12:40.099
Let's move!

12:57.316 --> 12:58.750
- You found him?
- Yeah.

12:58.784 --> 13:01.387
Take him to the clinic.

13:01.421 --> 13:02.621
It's okay.

13:02.655 --> 13:04.022
Tom, what's going on?

13:04.057 --> 13:05.457
You should hear this.
There you go.

13:05.491 --> 13:07.226
- You found the tube.
- Rick had it on him.

13:07.260 --> 13:09.128
I'm gonna need you to get
that transmitter up and running

13:09.162 --> 13:10.362
as soon as possible.
Okay.

13:10.397 --> 13:11.497
Come on in.

13:11.531 --> 13:13.332
Okay, we don't have
a lot of time,

13:13.367 --> 13:15.034
so I'm just
gonna lay it out.

13:15.069 --> 13:16.369
The Skitters
know where we are,

13:16.403 --> 13:18.271
and there's a good chance
they're gonna attack.

13:18.305 --> 13:19.472
We all hoped we could hang on

13:19.507 --> 13:21.174
until the strike team
made it back.

13:21.209 --> 13:22.509
That's too risky now,

13:22.544 --> 13:24.512
so I've decided
to evacuate the civilians.

13:24.546 --> 13:27.180
We're gonna walk them out through
the tunnel behind the auditorium.

13:27.215 --> 13:28.716
Once through, they'll move west,
away from the city.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.550
If the Skitters
have the scent,

13:30.585 --> 13:32.953
they'll be crawling
all over this area.

13:32.987 --> 13:34.320
It's not gonna be easy
to get around them.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.388
That's why
I'm gonna stay behind

13:36.423 --> 13:38.924
with a small group
of volunteers.

13:38.958 --> 13:41.260
If the aliens attack,
we'll draw their fire,

13:41.294 --> 13:42.694
keep them focused on us,

13:42.728 --> 13:44.529
maybe open up a window
for the civilians to escape.

13:44.563 --> 13:47.632
But how are we gonna hold off
the Skitters and Mechs?

13:47.667 --> 13:50.236
Our best soldiers
are with Weaver.

13:50.270 --> 13:52.238
I know how it sounds.

13:52.272 --> 13:56.009
But I want you to think
about where we are.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.045
Battles of Lexington and Concord
were fought

13:58.079 --> 14:00.114
not too far from here.

14:00.149 --> 14:01.416
Small force of colonists

14:01.450 --> 14:04.286
against the entire might
of the British Empire.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.989
Nobody gave them
much of a chance, either.

14:07.023 --> 14:09.024
Patrick Henry called it.

14:09.059 --> 14:11.126
"The battle is not
to the strong alone.

14:11.161 --> 14:13.628
It is to the vigilant,
the active, and the brave."

14:13.663 --> 14:16.465
A small, disciplined militia
can not only hold out

14:16.499 --> 14:19.301
against a larger force
but drive it back

14:19.335 --> 14:24.372
because they're fighting for
what rightfully belongs to them.

14:24.407 --> 14:28.076
This is our home, our world.

14:28.110 --> 14:30.345
So remember that if they come.

14:32.114 --> 14:34.849
So let's go do this.

14:55.001 --> 14:56.868
Mechs are moving into
position around the structure!

14:56.903 --> 14:58.036
What about
the other teams?

14:58.588 --> 15:00.189
We can't get that close.

15:00.223 --> 15:02.858
We saw smoke coming from
one of the set points.

15:02.892 --> 15:04.159
Looks like an attack.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.195
We don't think
the other teams made it.

15:06.229 --> 15:08.130
And the way those Mechs
were moving,

15:08.164 --> 15:10.432
you got to know
they're ready for us.

15:15.506 --> 15:19.643
Hal, get your bike.
You're going back to the school.

15:19.678 --> 15:21.312
With the rest of you,
right?

15:21.346 --> 15:23.681
I don't know about the rest
of us, but I'm staying here.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.785
No way.

15:26.819 --> 15:28.853
Look, I made it this far,
and whatever the next move is,

15:28.888 --> 15:30.288
I'm gonna see this through.

15:30.322 --> 15:31.656
The next move
is for you to fall back.

15:31.690 --> 15:33.624
You go back and tell Tom
he was right --

15:33.658 --> 15:35.726
the 4th and 5th are gone.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.261
Civilians need to evacuate.

15:37.295 --> 15:39.363
If you're still going
for the structure,

15:39.398 --> 15:41.199
you're gonna need
every man possible.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.366
You listen to me.

15:42.401 --> 15:44.635
There'll be other battles
after today,

15:44.669 --> 15:46.570
but only
if these people know

15:46.604 --> 15:48.539
that these things
can be hit,

15:48.573 --> 15:50.274
and they can be hit hard.

15:50.308 --> 15:51.542
So let me help.

15:51.576 --> 15:55.580
You can <i>help</i> by going back

15:55.615 --> 15:57.683
and telling everyone you see

15:57.717 --> 16:00.252
that the fighters of the
2nd Mass carried out an attack

16:00.287 --> 16:02.255
against the alien structure
over Boston.

16:02.289 --> 16:06.159
You tell them
the resistance drew blood.

16:06.194 --> 16:10.364
You give these people hope,

16:10.399 --> 16:14.535
and then you can lead the next
fight and the one after that.

16:14.570 --> 16:16.770
Captain, you --

16:16.805 --> 16:19.573
That's an order, son!

16:25.748 --> 16:28.349
Be careful.

16:45.470 --> 16:46.737
Hey, Matt,
I've been looking for you.

16:46.771 --> 16:48.539
You got to get going.

16:48.573 --> 16:50.241
No.
Not without you.

16:50.275 --> 16:51.675
Why?
What's the matter?

16:52.643 --> 16:54.611
You're still mad at me,
aren't you?

16:54.645 --> 16:56.613
For helping Pope?

16:59.183 --> 17:00.483
I was angry with you,
yeah,

17:00.518 --> 17:02.718
and I'm sorry
that we haven't had a chance

17:02.753 --> 17:04.086
to talk about it until now.

17:04.121 --> 17:06.155
I'll never do it again.
I promise.

17:06.189 --> 17:07.723
Actually,
you probably will,

17:07.757 --> 17:09.525
and I'll probably call you
on it, just like yesterday.

17:11.828 --> 17:15.531
You are growing up.

17:15.566 --> 17:19.403
And it's not gonna be easy
for you to find your place

17:19.436 --> 17:22.272
or for me to know
when to back off.

17:22.307 --> 17:23.540
And if I seem angry,

17:23.576 --> 17:27.713
it's only 'cause
I care about you so much.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.481
Come on.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.717
Dr. Glass wants to get
all the kids out first.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.101
Dad, you know those Mech bullets
that we made?

17:35.102 --> 17:35.880
Yeah?

17:35.881 --> 17:37.112
Do you think they'll help?

17:37.189 --> 17:38.989
Yeah, I do.

17:40.391 --> 17:42.125
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.327
Let's go.

17:47.965 --> 17:49.832
Hey.

17:49.867 --> 17:52.735
Sarah.
Charlotte's so beautiful.

17:52.769 --> 17:56.272
She's more than that.
She's a miracle. Thank you.

17:56.306 --> 17:58.407
Of course. Stay safe.

17:58.441 --> 18:01.610
Okay, everyone
be careful on the steps.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.312
Once you're in the tunnel,

18:03.346 --> 18:06.482
stay close
and follow your guide.

18:06.517 --> 18:09.786
Anne! Hey.

18:09.820 --> 18:11.154
I could stay with you.

18:11.188 --> 18:12.589
I mean, you don't know
what's coming, and...

18:12.624 --> 18:14.491
Someone needs to watch out
for Rick.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.660
And you never know when someone
might need a doctor.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.330
A year of medical school
hardly makes me a doctor.

18:19.365 --> 18:22.300
A year of this,
and you're that and more.

18:22.335 --> 18:25.504
You've helped out
a lot of people, Lourdes.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.039
Especially me.

18:29.743 --> 18:32.678
Stay safe.

18:32.713 --> 18:35.181
You too.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.683
Okay. We'll catch up.
I promise.

18:37.718 --> 18:39.519
Okay.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.554
Bye.
Bye.

18:45.159 --> 18:46.794
I'm surprised Rick
held on to it.

18:46.828 --> 18:49.263
Would have been
just as easy to smash it.

18:49.297 --> 18:51.432
Maybe something wasn't
as far gone as we thought.

18:51.466 --> 18:53.834
Well, now we just got to
make it work during battle.

18:53.868 --> 18:56.270
No pressure. You ready
to give it another go?

18:56.305 --> 18:57.738
You got eight minutes,
and then he goes in the tunnel.

18:57.773 --> 18:59.474
- Tom.
- What?

18:59.508 --> 19:01.509
Ben is keyed in
to their communications grid.

19:01.543 --> 19:03.578
I know. So find the frequency
and start jamming.

19:03.612 --> 19:05.313
But they keep changing
the frequency.

19:05.347 --> 19:07.515
I said he could stay to find
the frequency, and that's it.

19:07.550 --> 19:08.683
Now you got seven minutes.

19:08.717 --> 19:10.118
Okay. Good.

19:10.152 --> 19:11.452
No, no, not good.
I can do this, dad.

19:11.486 --> 19:12.753
I know you can,
but if this attack comes,

19:12.788 --> 19:14.622
I don't want you here.

19:14.656 --> 19:16.490
What if they change the frequency?
Scott will never find it.

19:16.524 --> 19:19.159
I'm sorry, Tom, but he's right.
This could be our one shot.

19:19.194 --> 19:21.662
And if it doesn't work, it won't
matter where any of us go.

19:23.765 --> 19:25.366
Dad.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.667
I know what they're saying
about me and Rick,

19:26.702 --> 19:28.536
that we're infected
by these harnesses.

19:28.570 --> 19:31.172
But if I can use
what the Skitters did to me

19:31.207 --> 19:33.642
to get back at them,
you have to let me.

19:33.676 --> 19:35.678
Hey. Scout has Mechs
inside a mile.

19:35.712 --> 19:38.881
All right, if I say run,
you run. Find it.

19:40.818 --> 19:42.719
Okay, are you ready?

19:42.753 --> 19:45.355
Let her rip.
Okay.

20:02.382 --> 20:04.515
Hey, kid. Kid.

20:05.984 --> 20:08.652
Why don't you come stand
over here with me?

20:11.289 --> 20:12.823
The name's Jimmy.

20:12.857 --> 20:14.424
Not kid.

20:14.459 --> 20:15.926
All right, then, Jimmy.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.762
This ought to be a cakewalk
after taking on a Skitter.

20:18.796 --> 20:21.864
Yeah, well, if it wasn't
for Captain Weaver,

20:21.899 --> 20:23.967
I wouldn't be here
right now.

20:24.001 --> 20:25.935
I really miss him.

20:25.969 --> 20:30.606
All right. How about
you and me make a pact?

20:30.641 --> 20:33.142
You watch my back,
and I'll watch yours.

20:34.011 --> 20:35.744
Deal?
Deal.

20:37.347 --> 20:40.416
All right, when they come,

20:40.450 --> 20:41.850
nobody shoot
until I give the order.

20:41.885 --> 20:44.252
You got 30 rounds
of Mech ammunition each.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.787
Let's make every shot count.

20:45.821 --> 20:46.921
Yes, sir!
All right, Tom!

20:46.955 --> 20:48.389
Hopefully our families

20:48.423 --> 20:49.990
have made it
through the tunnel by now.

20:51.493 --> 20:53.294
Mech!

20:53.328 --> 20:55.229
It's coming!

20:55.263 --> 20:57.899
All right,
everybody down! Down!

21:02.839 --> 21:04.840
Wait for my signal.

21:06.376 --> 21:09.411
Their guns spin up
before they shoot,

21:09.446 --> 21:11.981
like taking a breath.
Listen for it.

21:12.015 --> 21:14.784
Okay.

21:14.818 --> 21:16.318
Easy!

21:16.353 --> 21:17.720
Anything?

21:17.754 --> 21:20.522
The Mech's still coming.

21:20.557 --> 21:23.525
Damn things must have
changed frequencies.

21:23.559 --> 21:27.061
Easy!
Wait till it gets closer!

21:36.737 --> 21:38.138
All right, open fire!

22:07.870 --> 22:09.737
We got him!
We got him!

22:11.274 --> 22:13.608
I guess those Mech bullets
really work, huh?

22:19.282 --> 22:20.816
Ben.

22:35.866 --> 22:38.201
Everybody get down!
Get down!

22:44.640 --> 22:46.007
Call out your ammo!

22:46.042 --> 22:49.310
- I got two.
- Three shots left.

22:49.344 --> 22:51.579
Four.
How many more we got?

22:51.613 --> 22:52.913
Too many.

22:52.948 --> 22:55.149
They're gonna draw our fire
until we're out of ammo.

22:57.063 --> 22:58.263
We got to find
the right frequency

22:58.554 --> 23:00.556
and jam
the communications.

23:00.590 --> 23:02.425
There. Right there.
I'm feeling it.

23:02.459 --> 23:04.794
Oh. I'm sorry.
Sorry, son.

23:06.363 --> 23:07.463
Ugh! No.

23:07.497 --> 23:08.697
Is that it?
No, no. Back a bit.

23:08.732 --> 23:11.500
Back a bit.
Back a bit.

23:11.535 --> 23:13.603
Ugh! Ohh!

23:13.638 --> 23:15.739
There it is. There it is.
There it is.

23:15.773 --> 23:17.907
All right. Anything?

23:17.942 --> 23:20.743
The Mechs
are still coming.

23:20.778 --> 23:23.479
We got the frequency. Maybe the
signal's not strong enough.

23:23.514 --> 23:24.814
Can we make it stronger?

23:24.848 --> 23:26.348
The generator's
maxed out.

23:26.382 --> 23:29.818
Maybe a --
maybe a bigger antenna.

23:31.954 --> 23:33.622
How about the flagpole?

23:33.656 --> 23:36.691
Well, it's metal.

23:36.726 --> 23:38.927
Okay.

23:50.541 --> 23:52.575
Are you scared, too?

23:52.609 --> 23:54.978
Okay, you stay down until
I give you the word, all right?

23:55.012 --> 23:57.581
You remember our deal?
You watch my back.

24:10.995 --> 24:12.729
No! No, Ben!

24:12.764 --> 24:14.264
We'll get one
of the fighters.

24:14.298 --> 24:15.698
There's more Mechs coming.
I can hear them.

24:16.901 --> 24:20.170
Ben, what are you doing?!
Get back!

24:20.204 --> 24:21.805
Dad!
We have a signal.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.674
We just have to
make it stronger.

24:44.496 --> 24:48.567
- I'm out of Mech ammo!
- Me too!

24:52.372 --> 24:53.773
Jimmy.

24:53.807 --> 24:57.643
You want to see
something beautiful?

25:06.287 --> 25:08.588
They're running away.

25:08.622 --> 25:11.358
The Mechs --
what are they doing?

25:11.392 --> 25:13.226
They're retreating.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.795
The Mechs --

25:14.829 --> 25:16.663
th-they're running
away from <i>us?</i>

25:16.698 --> 25:19.399
That's right!
And this is just the start!

25:19.434 --> 25:21.501
We beat them once,
we can beat them again!

25:21.536 --> 25:23.804
Yeah!

25:23.838 --> 25:27.307
Yeah! Yeah!

25:27.341 --> 25:29.409
Yeah!

25:29.443 --> 25:31.778
Yeah!

25:41.405 --> 25:43.006
Did you see them
turn and run?

25:43.040 --> 25:44.774
Maybe we don't have
to leave now.

25:44.809 --> 25:46.776
The Skitters didn't know
what hit them,

25:46.811 --> 25:48.378
but they'll be back.

25:48.412 --> 25:49.780
You did all right out there,
Jimmy.

25:49.814 --> 25:50.881
Thanks.

25:50.915 --> 25:52.282
Everyone's
just about out.

25:52.316 --> 25:53.617
Okay.
How's Ben?

25:53.651 --> 25:55.585
As long as Scott's jamming
their transmissions,

25:55.620 --> 25:57.487
he's hurting,
but he's hanging in there.

25:57.522 --> 25:59.089
Thanks for what
you did today.

25:59.123 --> 26:00.824
Hey, Dad.

26:00.858 --> 26:03.894
Thank God you're back.
Are you okay?

26:03.928 --> 26:05.796
I'm fine, Dad.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.431
The 4th and 5th --
they just never showed up.

26:07.465 --> 26:08.799
What about Weaver?

26:08.834 --> 26:11.235
He's with Gibson, Pope,
and Anthony at the west leg.

26:11.269 --> 26:12.537
They're gonna try to complete
the mission any way they can.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.771
- By themselves?
- Yeah.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.773
That's suicide.
Weaver's got to know that.

26:15.807 --> 26:18.275
I think that's why
they sent me back.

26:18.309 --> 26:19.743
I guess they just can't
live with themselves

26:19.778 --> 26:21.078
if they didn't
at least try.

26:21.112 --> 26:22.646
You just rode all the way in
from Boston

26:22.681 --> 26:24.014
and you didn't run
into any trouble?

26:24.049 --> 26:26.983
No, the roads were clear.
Why?

26:27.018 --> 26:28.818
Scott's
jamming idea worked.

26:28.853 --> 26:31.087
It could be the aliens are
withdrawing their forces,

26:31.121 --> 26:32.922
trying to figure out
what just hit them.

26:32.957 --> 26:34.992
If that's true,
there might be an opportunity.

26:35.026 --> 26:37.728
Tell Scott that I want the
generator and the transmitter

26:37.762 --> 26:40.531
loaded onto a vehicle,
all set and ready to go.

26:40.565 --> 26:43.667
Dad, what are we doing?
I'll meet you there.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.545
Hi.
Hi.

26:54.580 --> 26:58.516
Don't laugh, but I'm actually
gonna miss this place.

26:58.551 --> 27:01.553
I'm leaving
with some good memories --

27:01.588 --> 27:03.956
first I've had
since this started.

27:03.991 --> 27:08.494
So, you ready to sleep
under the stars?

27:08.528 --> 27:10.062
What's wrong?

27:10.096 --> 27:12.464
The Skitters pulled back.

27:12.498 --> 27:14.399
That ought to give you
enough time

27:14.433 --> 27:16.435
to get the civilians
someplace safe.

27:16.469 --> 27:17.836
You'll want to look

27:17.870 --> 27:20.205
for somewhere secluded,
close to water.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.806
I'm sure you'll know it
when you see it.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.542
I'm not going with you
right away.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.110
Why?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.645
Because, like you said,

27:27.679 --> 27:28.946
when Porter made me
second-in-command,

27:28.980 --> 27:30.381
he knew that I would do
whatever I could

27:30.415 --> 27:32.950
to keep
the civilians safe.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.054
And I've done that.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.923
And now we've got men
in the field

27:37.958 --> 27:39.892
that deserve
the same consideration,

27:39.926 --> 27:41.661
and I can't walk away.

27:41.695 --> 27:45.198
You're going back into Boston
for Weaver.

27:46.934 --> 27:49.603
I can't change your mind,
can I?

27:51.139 --> 27:54.708
Tom...
What about Matt and Ben?

27:54.742 --> 27:57.277
That's why
I wanted to talk to you.

27:57.312 --> 27:59.746
If something
should happen to me...

28:02.517 --> 28:04.685
...You're the only person
that I trust

28:04.719 --> 28:06.019
to watch out for them.

28:08.456 --> 28:11.191
I'll be there for them.
You know that.

28:12.761 --> 28:15.329
But only until
you come back.

28:15.363 --> 28:16.930
And you will come back,

28:16.965 --> 28:19.866
because your sons
need you.

28:19.901 --> 28:22.769
These people need you.

28:56.306 --> 28:57.572
Here you go,
Mr. Scott.

28:57.607 --> 28:58.941
Okay.

28:58.975 --> 29:01.576
Oh, this must be really
messing their heads up.

29:01.611 --> 29:03.078
The frequency's
still locked in place.

29:03.113 --> 29:05.013
How are you feeling?

29:05.048 --> 29:07.683
I just hope they're feeling
as crappy as I am.

29:07.717 --> 29:10.953
Okay, so, I hooked the antenna
leads up to the chassis,

29:10.987 --> 29:13.689
which means that this whole car
is one big antenna.

29:13.724 --> 29:14.891
You keep the generator
full of gas,

29:14.925 --> 29:16.592
and, uh,
you're good to go.

29:16.627 --> 29:18.662
It might be enough
to keep them off of me

29:18.696 --> 29:19.829
until I get to the city.

29:19.864 --> 29:21.397
What if they change
the frequency again?

29:21.431 --> 29:22.732
Let's hope
that they don't.

29:22.767 --> 29:24.935
Dad, I can do this.
I can help you.

29:24.969 --> 29:26.603
You already did.

29:26.637 --> 29:29.705
So, I drew the route
that we took to get down there,

29:29.740 --> 29:32.942
but I wish you'd reconsider...
Or bring me with you.

29:32.976 --> 29:34.544
No.

29:34.578 --> 29:36.512
I need to know
that you're safe

29:36.546 --> 29:38.781
and that you're looking out
for your brothers.

29:44.153 --> 29:46.955
Come here.

29:46.989 --> 29:49.557
I love you.

30:09.682 --> 30:13.084
GTO.

30:23.430 --> 30:24.597
Damn, Professor.

30:24.631 --> 30:27.367
Try making
a human noise next time.

30:27.401 --> 30:28.768
Damn near
blew your head off.

30:28.803 --> 30:30.370
Anthony --
is he --

30:30.404 --> 30:32.939
he's breathing, but he's --
he's bleeding really bad.

30:32.973 --> 30:35.174
I'm not a big fan
of super-cop here,

30:35.208 --> 30:37.676
but figuring Christmas is
right around the corner --

30:37.711 --> 30:38.944
it's actually
a couple months off.

30:38.979 --> 30:40.112
Come on.
All right, careful.

30:40.147 --> 30:41.614
Help me get him
in the back here.

30:41.649 --> 30:43.683
Okay.

30:51.191 --> 30:52.892
What about Weaver?

30:52.926 --> 30:54.193
Last time I saw him,

30:54.227 --> 30:58.897
he was heading
towards party central there.

30:58.932 --> 31:00.566
Figured on account
I didn't hear anything

31:00.600 --> 31:01.700
that sounded
like a boom,

31:01.734 --> 31:03.635
I'm guessing
he didn't make it.

31:03.669 --> 31:05.737
The only thing
I can't figure out

31:05.771 --> 31:07.939
is why the spidery --
easy, easy, easy.

31:07.974 --> 31:09.307
I got him.

31:09.342 --> 31:13.379
The spidery bastards
didn't finish us off.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.481
This the old man's
radio rig?

31:15.515 --> 31:16.849
Yeah.

31:16.883 --> 31:20.019
It seems to have kept them
off of us for a while.

31:20.053 --> 31:22.722
You both need a doctor.

31:22.756 --> 31:24.524
You're going down there,
aren't you?

31:24.558 --> 31:26.760
Yeah.
You take the car.

31:26.794 --> 31:28.428
Get Anthony
back to the school.

31:28.463 --> 31:30.930
Professor.

31:30.965 --> 31:33.399
In the trunk
of the GTO --

31:33.434 --> 31:36.268
a little something
might come in handy.

31:47.980 --> 31:49.647
Pretty, ain't it?

31:49.681 --> 31:54.385
Standard army issue,
only with a Mech metal shell.

31:54.420 --> 31:55.887
It'll do in a pinch.

31:55.921 --> 31:58.589
Oh, it just might.

32:01.794 --> 32:03.128
Hey, Tom.

32:04.664 --> 32:06.665
Good luck to you.

32:34.046 --> 32:36.047
Gib?

32:39.943 --> 32:42.010
Damn.

32:42.044 --> 32:45.146
- Captain?
- Tom.

32:47.049 --> 32:49.752
Tom! What...

32:49.786 --> 32:51.887
Gibson?

32:51.922 --> 32:54.725
He's gone.

32:54.759 --> 32:57.160
The school -- were we --

32:57.195 --> 32:59.029
Skitters and Mechs took a run
at us, but we held them off.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.197
Good.

33:00.232 --> 33:01.432
What happened to you?

33:01.467 --> 33:02.767
As we got near the leg,

33:02.801 --> 33:04.869
a ship came in
and took us out.

33:04.903 --> 33:08.706
Oh, wow!

33:08.741 --> 33:11.209
We were close when it hit us.
The bomb's no good now.

33:11.243 --> 33:15.279
You know,
these ships...

33:18.117 --> 33:19.984
...I think they're
being called home.

33:20.019 --> 33:21.119
Why?

33:21.153 --> 33:22.353
We jammed
their frequency,

33:22.387 --> 33:23.821
messed up
their communications.

33:23.855 --> 33:25.889
Must be why
the streets are deserted.

33:25.924 --> 33:28.091
Maybe we rattled
their cage.

33:28.126 --> 33:32.096
Maybe they're confused...

33:32.130 --> 33:34.432
Maybe a little afraid.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.542
What are you thinking?

33:48.915 --> 33:52.784
I'm thinking that I'm
close enough to take a shot.

33:55.087 --> 33:57.789
Tom...
When the aliens first hit,

33:57.823 --> 34:01.659
all our surviving troops fired
every heavy weapon they had

34:01.693 --> 34:03.027
into those things --

34:03.061 --> 34:04.695
never made a dent.

34:04.729 --> 34:07.131
The chances of us bringing
one of their ships down,

34:07.165 --> 34:09.300
even with a Mech load,
are --

34:09.333 --> 34:12.371
About as slim as our chance
of having made it this far?

34:19.210 --> 34:23.382
Come on! Let's let them know
we were here.

34:28.754 --> 34:30.289
Go ahead.

34:55.815 --> 34:58.018
Good shot.

35:02.658 --> 35:04.959
I think we got
their attention.

35:06.929 --> 35:09.831
You think this thing
will run?

35:09.866 --> 35:11.867
We can try.

35:19.710 --> 35:22.045
If any of the teams survived,
maybe they will be there.

35:22.079 --> 35:25.282
Whoa.
What the hell?

35:25.316 --> 35:27.251
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait.

35:29.020 --> 35:30.487
It's Karen.

35:36.894 --> 35:39.195
Karen?

35:39.230 --> 35:41.264
Did they send you
to find us?

35:41.299 --> 35:43.467
Tom?

35:44.936 --> 35:46.703
That's right.

35:46.738 --> 35:50.840
They brought me here
because they don't understand.

35:50.875 --> 35:53.009
Who doesn't?

36:13.998 --> 36:18.401
They didn't expect...
Resistance on this level.

36:18.436 --> 36:21.404
They find that
interesting...

36:21.438 --> 36:23.206
And want to talk.

36:23.240 --> 36:26.376
Interesting?

36:28.178 --> 36:31.181
You thought
this was gonna be easy!

36:31.215 --> 36:36.786
Superior forces,
superior weapons!

36:36.821 --> 36:39.222
You murdered millions of people!
You steal our children!

36:39.257 --> 36:41.524
And now
you want to negotiate?!

36:41.559 --> 36:43.087
What the hell
do you want from us?!

36:43.088 --> 36:44.161
I don't give a damn
what it wants.

36:44.162 --> 36:45.829
I'm gonna blow this one
straight to hell.

36:45.863 --> 36:47.330
- Don't.
- After all the people they killed?!

36:47.364 --> 36:50.367
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't.

36:51.903 --> 36:53.970
Because of Ben.

36:56.207 --> 36:57.674
Ben? What about Ben?

36:57.709 --> 37:00.677
The harness...
Is a process.

37:00.711 --> 37:02.880
And Ben isn't free
from it.

37:02.914 --> 37:07.451
They'll call him back...
Unless you go with them.

37:10.989 --> 37:13.925
It's a lie, Tom.
You don't want to do this.

37:13.959 --> 37:16.762
No, I don't.

37:16.797 --> 37:20.233
But that patch of skin
on his back,

37:20.267 --> 37:22.869
and the way he hears
that signal --

37:22.904 --> 37:26.173
they still got
a hold over him.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.609
Tom, I know how much Ben
means to you,

37:28.643 --> 37:31.245
but you can't
trust them.

37:31.279 --> 37:33.013
They can force you.

37:34.282 --> 37:36.084
But they don't want that.

37:46.296 --> 37:48.164
Tom.

37:48.198 --> 37:51.400
I can't let them
take Ben back.

38:06.085 --> 38:08.220
Tom?

38:15.161 --> 38:18.197
Tom?

38:25.106 --> 38:27.983
Tom?
