 intended from the moment
 it entered the star system.

00:04.672 --> 00:07.741
YOUNG: That ship
 is the best chance
 we have of getting home.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.043
Are we done?

00:09.077 --> 00:10.378
We'll never be done.

 left him on the planet.

YOUNG: You think
 I don't know that?

00:15.116 --> 00:16.350
CHLOE: Everyone thinks
 we're safe.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.852
They think that
 they'll never
 find us again.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.421
Why did you take
 one of our people
 prisoner?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.190
(ROARING)

 YOUNG: Who's coming?

00:25.893 --> 00:27.495
Lucian Alliance.
 They're coming
 to take Destiny.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.497
RUSH: There's only one way
 this is going to end
 if we wait.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.931
YOUNG: I'm not
 surrendering this ship.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.503
JOHANSEN: Chloe,
 what are you
 doing in here?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.238
I don't know
 how I got here.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.874
RUSH: There may be
 something happening to
 Chloe on a cellular level.

00:40.908 --> 00:44.378
Some kind of
 genetic manipulation
 gradually changing her.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.114
SCOTT:
 What were you doing?

00:46.147 --> 00:49.717
CHLOE: He wanted me
 to look at some equations,
 see if I understood them.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.120
Did you?
 I don't know.

00:52.153 --> 00:55.523
JOHANSEN: So, the chair
 kills off any potential
 alien matter inside her

00:55.556 --> 00:57.725
while leaving her
 human side unaffected.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.193
She's breathing
 and her pulse is steady.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.394
Did it work?

01:00.428 --> 01:01.395
We'll soon find out,
 won't we?

01:02.996 --> 01:04.232
(ENGINE HUMMING)

01:09.170 --> 01:14.408
WOMAN: I think it's, uh,
 right over there.
 Yeah, can you see it?

01:15.476 --> 01:17.077
We're comin' into town.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.216
How can you tell?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.918
Hey, it beats
 the hell out of our digs
 in Kandahar, don't it?

01:27.488 --> 01:29.823
I wouldn't miss it
for the world, brother.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.560
Well, I appreciate it.
 I do.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.927
DRIVER: Cloverdale!

01:35.095 --> 01:35.996
Me first!

01:54.448 --> 01:56.484
Damn, I thought
 my dad might be here.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.294
There they are.

Just cut it off me, please!

02:13.634 --> 02:15.269
Try something else!

02:15.303 --> 02:16.604
I've tried
 everything in my bag.
 Nothing is working.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.315
What the hell's
 the matter with you?

02:28.916 --> 02:30.484
BRODY: Sorry!

02:30.518 --> 02:32.286
I'm sorry, he just
 ran out in front of me!

02:32.320 --> 02:33.454
No, I'm fine.
 I'm fine, I'm fine...

02:33.487 --> 02:34.522

02:35.989 --> 02:38.226
No, no, no,
 I was just being stupid.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.194
Look, Mr. Brody,
 don't worry about it.
 They bounce at this age.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.463
Okay. Hey, are we
 still on for the, uh...

02:42.496 --> 02:44.131
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
 Go, go.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.234
We're takin' up
 the whole road here, guys.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.169
If you wind up with
any insurance issues, Matt,
I got it all on video.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.305
I kind of wish
 you didn't, Eli.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.874
Oh, you, uh,
 you must be Ronald.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.643
Oh, Dad, sorry,
 this is Ron,
 my best man.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.478
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.979
Oh, you call me Everett.
 You're family now.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.248
Yes, sir.
 And this is
 Chloe's brother, Eli.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.550
Brother Elijah.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.418
Eli, actually,

03:04.452 --> 03:07.421
and I took myself out of
 the running for best man,

03:07.455 --> 03:09.156
because I'm creating a video
 for my wedding gift.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.558
Lucky for me.
Yeah.

03:10.591 --> 03:11.859
Where's Chloe?

03:11.892 --> 03:14.161
Uh... Something
about a dress.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.296
She's going to meet you
at the house.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.098
I guess I'm anxious
to see her.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.270
I'll say,
 nearly got yourself killed
 the day before your wedding.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.672
Yeah, probably
would've ruined
the whole weekend, huh?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.907
Yeah, probably,

03:26.940 --> 03:29.543
but I guess since it looks
 like you're gonna live
 for another day,

03:29.577 --> 03:30.878
welcome home, Son.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.300
Okay, he's out again.
 Guys, we can move him.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.106
You'll be able to help him
 once we're back on the ship,
 right?

03:59.139 --> 04:01.074
We can't risk
 taking him aboard.
 It's too dangerous.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.710
CHLOE: What?
 JOHANSEN: Rush is right.

04:02.743 --> 04:06.213
You saw how quickly
 the organism spreads
 on contact.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.247
It could take over
 the whole ship.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.049
He can't stay here either.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.251
Chloe. Now, ready?
 One, two, three.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.922
I got you, buddy.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.293
Come on, come on,
 move your feet, Eli.
 Come on.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.295
Okay!

04:21.329 --> 04:23.397
I'll run ahead,
 contact Destiny,

04:23.431 --> 04:25.232
try to get them to send back
 medical supplies.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.134
If I'm fast, I'll get
 back before you reach
 the gate, okay?

04:27.167 --> 04:28.302
Yeah, yeah, good. Go.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.539

 Yeah. Whoa. Stop.

Wow. Aw, this hasn't
 changed one bit.

ELI: Matt is clearly moved
 seeing the old homestead
 again.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.096
What's that?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.098
A temp track for
 the voice-over.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.167
All good documentaries
 have one.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.270
I'm thinking
 Kiefer Sutherland,
 but I'm the fallback.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.773
Ronald, uh,
 make yourself at home.
 Let me grab that.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.108
You're going to be up
 in Matthew's room.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.443
You're in my room.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.278
I'll be fine on the couch
 in the den.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.513
You're the one
 with the fiancee.

 So, what's the plan?

05:20.253 --> 05:24.291

You get married,
you start a family,

05:24.324 --> 05:27.294
you grow old,
 and die happy.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.097
Okay, well, I thought
 you guys might, uh...

05:31.365 --> 05:32.633
What?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.668
I don't know,
 throw a party maybe?

05:36.604 --> 05:38.338
Was I supposed
 to do that?

05:39.272 --> 05:41.375
No, no. Yeah.

05:41.409 --> 05:45.178
No, uh, Chloe said
 she wanted you all
 to herself tonight.

05:45.212 --> 05:48.048

 something about
 wanting to catch

05:48.081 --> 05:49.216
the early show
 at the Clova.

05:49.249 --> 05:50.384
Really?

05:50.418 --> 05:52.052

 a movie any night.

doing right there?

 do to your arm?

the alien venom.

far has had any effect.

What else?

 clean bandages...

 for cutting through bone.

Well, we're getting
 married this weekend.

11:50.778 --> 11:53.713

 I did hear something
 about that.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.716
Wow! That must be...

11:59.119 --> 12:01.088
It is.
 Yeah, I bet it is.

 to Brody's,

12:09.062 --> 12:12.132

 they're open yet, do you?

 if you were...

 getting married?

20:10.243 --> 20:13.380
What? No!
Why would you say that?

Well, it's not up to me
to rule out anything,

21:17.444 --> 21:20.413
but we have to consider
 the possibility that
 Lieutenant Scott's infection

21:20.447 --> 21:22.682
is how this
 organism reproduces.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.751
It's already spread
to his blood.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.252
Well, still,
 there must be
 precautions.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.187
Against what?

21:28.220 --> 21:30.256
We have no idea
 what the next stage
 of infection entails.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.091
Even if we were to
 manage to move him

21:32.124 --> 21:33.993
from the Gate Room
 into quarantine,

21:34.026 --> 21:37.530
it's just a matter of time
 before the infected area
 would burst open

21:37.564 --> 21:40.199
and release
 microscopic spores
 into the ship's air.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.435
All we would have to do
is breathe it in

21:42.469 --> 21:44.170
and the same thing
 that's happening to Scott

21:44.203 --> 21:46.205
could happen to all of us
 from the inside out.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.475
Yeah, but you can't
 say that for sure.

21:48.508 --> 21:52.512
But we have to assume
 that this thing has infected
 Scott in order to spread.

21:52.545 --> 21:57.016
One way or another.
 It's what virulent,
 aggressive organisms do.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.719
We can't
 invite it aboard.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.454
Okay.

22:01.488 --> 22:05.392
Look, um...
 Please don't
 put this all on me.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.159
I'm not.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.295
Because he's one
 of the nicest people
 on the ship,

 to be the one that's...

 as you can dig.

 just quick!

Anything outside of that...

...is the kill zone.

 some intel on this thing.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.124
(BEEPING)

22:42.629 --> 22:44.263
(BUZZING)

22:44.296 --> 22:45.532
RUSH OVER INTERCOM: Hello.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.501
Hi. I'm Matt Scott.
 You're marrying me tonight?

22:48.535 --> 22:50.437
I... I mean,
me and my girlfriend.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.739
I wasn't confused.
 Come in.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.174
(DOOR BUZZING)

22:55.207 --> 22:58.711
So, uh, I guess
 we just want to go
 with the usual.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.282
The usual?

23:04.083 --> 23:06.052
Wedding vows.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.587
You know,
 "Dearly beloved..."

23:07.620 --> 23:09.155
I know what
 wedding vows are.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.225
(BOTH LAUGHING)

23:13.259 --> 23:16.162
I'm sorry, I'm...
 I'm not all here today.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.397
So...

23:21.300 --> 23:23.302
To what do we owe this,
 uh, partial presence?

23:26.238 --> 23:28.741
Are you having doubts
 about what you're
 entering into?

23:28.775 --> 23:33.112
What, you...
 You mean about
 marrying Chloe?

23:33.145 --> 23:36.415
No, no, I love her.
I'm just a little
hung-over.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.486
Like father, like son.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.322
My dad is
 a great man.

23:45.858 --> 23:48.227
Anyway, we talked
 about it, me and Chloe,

23:48.260 --> 23:50.262
and we decided to go
 with the regular vows.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.430
They're all good.

23:53.332 --> 23:54.634
Traditional vows it is.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.376
Um... Is there
anything else we need
to talk about?

24:06.378 --> 24:07.547
I don't know.
Is there?

24:10.850 --> 24:12.351
I've been having
 this feeling.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.322
I don't know
 how to describe it.

24:16.355 --> 24:17.757
Something's
 not quite right.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.827
Yes, yeah.
Something is definitely
wrong here, and I...

24:22.629 --> 24:26.398
To tell you the truth,
 I think I'm...
 I think I'm losing it.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.303
Have you spoken
 to your father?

24:31.337 --> 24:32.104
Every time I try
 to say something,

24:32.138 --> 24:33.773
he tells me
 everything's great,

24:33.806 --> 24:35.274
and I should
 just be happy.
 Ah...

24:35.307 --> 24:36.442
The sage advice
 of great men.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.710
But I can see it
in his eyes.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.384
Oh, I am scared.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.857
Well, you know,
I'm not a great
man, Matthew,

24:52.825 --> 24:55.695
but I can tell you
 that fear...

24:55.728 --> 24:58.464
Well, it's just
 one of those things
 in this world,

24:58.497 --> 25:01.534
that proves beyond
a shadow of a doubt
that you're truly alive.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.773
And I can tell you
 that you're alive

25:07.674 --> 25:08.841
until you're dead.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.512
You are going to die,
 Matthew.

25:16.783 --> 25:19.752
We all will,
 eventually.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.690
Well, yeah.

25:26.759 --> 25:29.696
So, 7:00, then?

25:32.799 --> 25:34.533
The "Dearly Beloved"
 business.

25:35.267 --> 25:36.402
I'll be there.

25:37.436 --> 25:38.705
Your whole self, please.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.852
What we can see
above ground

25:52.885 --> 25:54.921
must only be a fraction
of the whole organism.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.624
The bulk of it has to be
 like an enormous root system

25:57.657 --> 25:59.626
that extends outward
 from the flora,

25:59.659 --> 26:02.762
dormant until its prey
 gets close enough
 to get stung

26:02.795 --> 26:05.965
and survive
just long enough
to spread spores.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.234
I don't even want
 to think of what it
 could do aboard ship.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.870
What do you think it is,
 plant, animal?

26:10.903 --> 26:14.874
Maybe properties
 of both, like coral,
 except its growth rate

26:14.907 --> 26:17.376
smacks right up
 against the laws
 of thermodynamics.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.045
It spreads
 upon contact,

26:19.078 --> 26:21.914
and it resisted
 every chemical
 T.J.'s exposed to it.

26:22.849 --> 26:24.784
Hmm. Let's hope it burns.

26:34.927 --> 26:38.264
Short bursts, gentlemen.
 Short bursts.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.846
T.J., go to Two.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.018
(ORGANISMS ROARING)

27:00.386 --> 27:02.621
Yes, sir.

27:02.655 --> 27:05.692
Are you sure Lieutenant Scott
 is the only one who's been
 infected?

27:05.725 --> 27:06.959
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.095
Well, I need you
 to be damn sure.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.297
I'm going to need you
 to send non-combatants
 back to the ship.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.365
The last thing we
 need is a mad dash
 at the last minute.

27:13.399 --> 27:14.967
Understood, sir.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.468
T.J., that means you, too.

27:16.502 --> 27:18.537
Sir, I'd like
 to keep trying.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.439
Don't make me
 come down there
 and get you.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.574
I'm not willing to
 lose both of you.
 Young out.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.486
He's dying, isn't he?

27:36.823 --> 27:37.757
How long?

27:39.591 --> 27:41.493
I don't know.

27:41.527 --> 27:43.796
He's strong,
 so probably longer
 than we can stay.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.631
No, I'm not leaving him.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.999
Chloe, I just got orders
 to send everybody

27:47.033 --> 27:48.367
but Greer's team
 back to the ship,

27:48.400 --> 27:49.702
and that includes you.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.470
Tamara, I have
 a right to stay.
 No, you don't!

27:51.503 --> 27:52.671
I'm not leaving!

27:54.540 --> 27:55.607
Chloe...

27:57.443 --> 27:59.746
(GASPING) Oh, my God.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.392
It doesn't look like
 it touched your skin.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.661
How did it get there?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.830
Maybe when Matt
 first cut the thing.

28:17.864 --> 28:20.532
It could have been
 a microscopic droplet
 for all we know.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.401
It grew right through
 the material.

28:22.434 --> 28:23.936
It's a miracle
 you weren't infected.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.373
Greer!

28:28.707 --> 28:29.742
Over here.

28:42.654 --> 28:43.956
You've got to
 be kidding me.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.699
Okay, listen up!

Everyone not on
 Sergeant Greer's fire team

28:55.634 --> 28:57.770
is going back
 through the stargate.

28:57.804 --> 29:00.039
Each of you needs
 to be checked for
 traces of the organism

29:00.072 --> 29:02.141
on your person
 before you go!

 Use the buddy system, okay?

29:24.163 --> 29:26.232
Eli, that means you.

 checking myself
 every 30 seconds.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.869

 a minute, okay?

29:43.149 --> 29:44.884
Damn, we look good.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.921
Is that you
 or Kiefer talking?

29:48.955 --> 29:50.756
Oh, I think Mr. Sutherland
 would agree.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.691
All right, they fit?

29:52.724 --> 29:56.028
It's like the enthusiasm
 just explodes
 out of your face.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.030
Yeah, well,
you did this to me.
Go change.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.537
Listen, Matt.
 I can't help
 but notice

30:05.571 --> 30:07.673
that something's
 bothering you.

30:07.706 --> 30:08.807
Beyond the blood
 alcohol level.

30:08.841 --> 30:09.876
I'm fine.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.114
I... I'm just saying
 that we've...

30:15.147 --> 30:16.715
We've known
 each other a long time,

30:16.748 --> 30:18.985
and I can pretty much tell
 when something is...

30:19.018 --> 30:20.219
What, you think
 you know me?

30:21.921 --> 30:23.489
You're not that deep.

Look, nobody
 who knows you at all

thinks of you
as a one-girl guy.

30:35.701 --> 30:38.837
It's not a criticism, okay?
 It's just... It's who you are.

30:41.908 --> 30:43.976
If you're having
 cold feet,
 I think that...

30:44.010 --> 30:46.012
No, listen, listen,
 I'm going to marry Chloe,

30:46.045 --> 30:48.147

a half-dozen kids,

30:48.180 --> 30:49.648
buy a house on
 my dad's street.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.083
We're going to
 renovate it together,

30:51.117 --> 30:52.651
play catch with the kids
 in the front yard,

30:52.684 --> 30:53.986
and go to Brody's
every Friday night.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.787
You can videotape
 the whole dang thing.

30:58.891 --> 31:01.727
Well...
 "A," that's a lot of tape.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.200
And "B," I don't think
 you believe that yourself.

Are we done?

31:23.582 --> 31:25.251
If... If you can hear me,

that nobody's giving up
on you.

keep fighting, too.

 Okay?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.880

I asked for
one lousy minute.

Where's Chloe?

31:58.150 --> 31:59.285
Chloe!

Now I have to stay.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.836
No, you didn't,
 did you?

32:17.869 --> 32:19.738
It wasn't that hard.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.073
It doesn't even
hurt that much.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.809
Chloe, why would
 you do that?

32:23.842 --> 32:25.811
They weren't
 going to let me stay.

32:27.679 --> 32:28.747
Now they have no choice.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.082

come back!

 made up her mind.

 but I had to do this.

 check you out.

You were on
 the floor, man.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.168

A lot of things can
cause a syncope episode,
but you don't have a fever.

 don't listen to him.
 That was nothing.

 a little too much
 to drink last night.

 on electrolytes.

 to the hospital...

married tonight,

 me up with a stick.

 got on my clothes.

 been infected,

 showed up yet?

never do that.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.533
I'm asking you,
 please, Dad.

36:42.368 --> 36:43.569
Wake up.

36:46.472 --> 36:47.539
Wake up.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.095
Your blood
looks normal to me.

37:10.128 --> 37:12.097
No, but it's not normal.
 They changed me.

37:12.130 --> 37:14.132
You said the chair
 undid all that.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.967
Well, obviously
 she relapsed.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.372
The point is whatever they
 did to her, it's given her
 immunity to this organism.

37:20.406 --> 37:23.208
Look. Look,
 I'm already healing.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.544
RUSH: A transfusion
 of Chloe's blood
 could help save his life.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.213
And pass whatever
 the Aliens did to her
 on to him.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.248
Well, I think that's
 a bargain he'd be willing
 to make, don't you?

37:36.988 --> 37:39.224
Dearly beloved,

37:39.257 --> 37:43.962
we are gathered here
 in the face of this
 company to join this man

37:43.995 --> 37:45.597
and this woman
 in matrimony.

37:47.466 --> 37:52.304
It is not to be
entered into unadvisedly
or lightly,

37:52.338 --> 37:59.277
but reverently,
 discreetly, advisedly,
 and solemnly.

37:59.311 --> 38:04.015
Marriage is the union of
 husband and wife in heart,
 body, and mind.

38:04.049 --> 38:07.085
It is intended
 for their mutual joy,

38:07.118 --> 38:09.621
and for the help
 and comfort
 given one another

38:09.655 --> 38:11.623
in prosperity
 and adversity.

38:17.195 --> 38:20.265
Through this union,
 Matthew and Chloe
 make a commitment

38:20.298 --> 38:24.135
to embrace their dreams,
 realize their hopes,

38:24.169 --> 38:26.638
and to accept
 each other's failings.

38:31.176 --> 38:33.545
We are here today to
 witness this occasion,

38:33.579 --> 38:36.448
that marks the celebration
 of love and commitment

38:36.482 --> 38:40.285
with which this man
 and this woman begin
 their life together.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.455
If any person
 can show just cause

38:43.489 --> 38:46.191
why they may not
 be joined together,

38:46.224 --> 38:49.361
then let them speak now
 or forever hold their peace.

38:57.369 --> 39:00.005
Damn things
 don't want to burn.
 I'm running out of fuel.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.573
His pulse is getting
 stronger. I just need
 a little more time.

39:01.607 --> 39:03.375
I can't give it to you!

39:08.680 --> 39:10.716
(ORGANISM ROARING)

39:10.749 --> 39:13.084
Please!
 I know it's working!

39:13.118 --> 39:15.020
Sergeant, last time
we dialed the gate,

39:15.053 --> 39:17.322
did you see
how it reacted?

39:17.355 --> 39:19.324
We just got to keep
 dialing over and over.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.659
It may buy us
 the time we need.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.061
Not we. Just me.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.398
This ramp is about
 to get crowded.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.266
I need you two
 to get out of here.

39:28.299 --> 39:31.770
Sergeant...
 Go, go! Get out! Go!

39:41.880 --> 39:43.048
(CLICKING)

39:50.556 --> 39:54.092
Do you, Matthew,
 take Chloe to be
 your wife?

40:16.448 --> 40:18.550
Will you love her,
 comfort her,

40:18.584 --> 40:21.086
honor and keep her
 in sickness
 and in health,

40:25.423 --> 40:29.561
for richer, for poorer,
 for better, for worse,

40:29.595 --> 40:30.829
(ORGANISM ROARING)

40:34.666 --> 40:38.570
in sadness and in joy
and forsaking all others,

40:38.604 --> 40:43.441
keep yourself only
unto her for as long
as you both shall live?

40:47.479 --> 40:48.747
(GASPING)

40:48.780 --> 40:49.515
He's conscious.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.119
What the hell's going on?
 Stay down!

40:54.152 --> 40:56.688
CHLOE: (SCREAMING)
 Oh, my God, his arm!

40:56.722 --> 40:57.623
GREER: Are you okay?

40:57.656 --> 40:59.124
Well, yeah, but...

41:00.826 --> 41:02.327
Come on.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.198
Let's go!

41:12.303 --> 41:14.139
Whoa! We're okay,
 we're okay.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.478
Welcome home, son.

41:20.512 --> 41:24.449
Thank you, sir.
I, uh, I don't know
how they did it, but...

41:24.482 --> 41:27.553
Unfortunately,
I do know.

41:27.586 --> 41:30.689
The three of you will undergo
 decontamination right away.

41:30.722 --> 41:31.790
Yes, sir.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.892
As for the two of you,

41:33.925 --> 41:36.461
you'll be placed in
 quarantine indefinitely,

41:36.494 --> 41:38.830
until I decide
 what to do with you.

41:39.665 --> 41:40.699
Sir?

41:43.535 --> 41:45.170
I'll let Miss Armstrong
 explain.
