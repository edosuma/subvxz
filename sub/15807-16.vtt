<i> ["The Ballad Of</i>
    <i> Gilligan's Island"]</i>

00:03.437 --> 00:05.370
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.439 --> 00:07.306
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:07.375 --> 00:09.441
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:09.509 --> 00:11.609
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:11.678 --> 00:14.212
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:14.281 --> 00:16.548
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:16.617 --> 00:19.017
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:19.085 --> 00:21.219
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:21.288 --> 00:24.155
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:24.224 --> 00:26.258
[thunder rumbling]

00:26.327 --> 00:28.393
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:28.462 --> 00:30.629
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:30.697 --> 00:33.198
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:33.267 --> 00:35.267
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:35.336 --> 00:37.636
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:37.705 --> 00:39.538
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore ¶

00:39.606 --> 00:42.374
¶ Of this
    uncharted desert isle ¶

00:42.443 --> 00:44.976
¶ With Gilligan ¶

00:45.045 --> 00:47.145
¶ The Skipper too ¶

00:47.214 --> 00:49.214
¶ The millionaire ¶

00:49.283 --> 00:51.683
¶ And his wife ¶

00:51.752 --> 00:54.619
¶ The movie star ¶

00:54.688 --> 00:56.288
¶ And the rest ¶

00:56.357 --> 01:01.226
¶ Are here on Gilligan's Isle ¶

01:32.593 --> 01:34.992
(Skipper)
          'Gilligan!'

01:35.061 --> 01:37.028
'Gilligan,
        where are you?'

01:37.097 --> 01:39.631
Gilligan.
           Gilligan!

01:42.937 --> 01:44.236
What are you doing
down here?

01:44.305 --> 01:45.970
You're supposed to be
cutting bamboo poles.

01:46.039 --> 01:49.574
I'm digging a barbeque pit for
  Mr. Howell. Goodbye, Skipper.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.676
- Goodbye, Skipper?
    - I gotta dig this pit.

01:51.745 --> 01:56.514
- So long. See you later.
   - Well, dig.

01:56.583 --> 02:00.252
Oh, Gilligan, let me show you
how to dig a barbeque pit.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.321
[Gilligan gasping]

02:02.389 --> 02:05.190
You broke the shovel,
           Skipper.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.860
Where is the rest
of this shovel?

02:10.663 --> 02:12.698
Gilligan, that's the fifth
shovel you've broken this week.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.633
Sorry, Skipper, but I hit
       something real hard.

02:14.701 --> 02:18.002
The only thing hard on this
island is your head.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.538
Soft...sand.

02:19.607 --> 02:23.275
See, I told you, must be
        a rock or something.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.444
Don't feel like a rock,
it feels square, Gilligan.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.580
- A big square rock?
      - Yeah.

02:29.649 --> 02:33.252
Gilligan...give me
the rest of that shovel.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.689
I think you've uncovered..

02:37.757 --> 02:39.424
Look at the chains.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.794
Dig!

02:45.899 --> 02:48.567
Gilligan, I think you've
uncovered a treasure chest.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.037
Careful. I gotta make
     a turn here.

02:53.106 --> 02:57.209
Yes, Gilligan, I see that
       we have to make a turn.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.777
- Give me that one.
     - Another roller down.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.612
- That's right, Gilligan.
   - Come on, push.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.215
If we work as a team,
           it'll see us through.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.684
Yes, but you're not pushing
hard enough. Come on.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.354
Come on, Skipper.
Push, push, push.

03:09.422 --> 03:12.023
Gilligan, I thought
      we could do this together.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.958
But since you're gonna
       stand there and criticize

03:14.027 --> 03:15.861
I'll do it myself.

03:18.765 --> 03:21.433
Oh, never mind that.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.401
Look at this chest,
             Gilligan.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.671
It must be hand forged.
    Even the lock and the chain.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.940
Forged. You mean
it's an imitation?

03:29.009 --> 03:32.377
This is the real thing. There
must be a fortune in this chest.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.212
Let's try and get
         this padlock unchained.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.215
Hand me that
                piece of bamboo.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.618
Here.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.753
I can hardly wait to see what's
inside that treasure chest.

03:41.821 --> 03:44.823
Treasure chest!
 What's in it? Oh, is it real?

03:44.891 --> 03:46.658
- Who found it?
- Why don't you try to open it?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.226
- Who buried it?
        - Can we help?

03:48.295 --> 03:50.329
Ginger, we don't know,
     maybe pirates.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.498
Mary Ann, I did,
 we're trying, and no, thanks.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.334
It's the most exciting thing
    that's happened to us.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.036
We always read about it,
but never expect to find any.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.470
Let's get some leverage on.

03:59.539 --> 04:00.805
One, two, three, go.

04:00.874 --> 04:01.839
[screaming]

04:01.908 --> 04:05.277
- Sorry, Skipper.
       - Ow, my pinkie.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.512
Please, everybody,
              stand back.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.315
I don't want anybody to be hurt
 when this chain snaps.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.023
Ah-h...the gold.

04:29.303 --> 04:32.103
Think the rust would've weakened
the chain after all this time.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.205
I hope we can saw the chain,
    with the piece of coral.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.873
We'll find out when
the girls get back.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.110
- Well, what have we here?
   - Hi, Mr. Howell.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.512
Treasure chest, got it when I
 was digging the barbeque pit.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.115
Lovey, that's how millionaire's
used to keep their money.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.852
Great, but it doesn't look as
though it could hold very much.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.186
Our piggy banks
are bigger than that.

04:49.255 --> 04:51.356
Have you tried
to open it?

04:53.360 --> 04:55.627
Skipper! Skipper,
      maybe this'll work.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.328
I got it off the fish
we had last night.

04:57.397 --> 05:00.999
Hold the chain. Ready?
Watch it. Cut it right.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.139
Gilligan, I could've told you,
  that wouldn't work.

05:08.208 --> 05:11.710
You've gotta use your head.
 That's why I'm using the coral.

05:11.778 --> 05:14.845
- Does that work?
       - No.

05:14.914 --> 05:17.749
I wish the Professor were here.
He could tell us how to open it.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.851
He's on the other side,
searching in caves.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.985
He'll be back tomorrow.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.454
That chest's been closed
    for hundreds of years.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.723
One day wouldn't make
     any difference.

05:24.792 --> 05:25.991
I suggest we have
       a goodnight sleep

05:26.060 --> 05:28.994
and try first thing
      in the morning.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.230
Gee, thanks for putting up
my hair, Ginger.

05:32.299 --> 05:35.066
I couldn't sleep anyway thinking
about that treasure chest.

05:35.135 --> 05:38.803
I hope it's filled with diamonds
or gold or even silver.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.238
What would you like
to find in it?

05:40.307 --> 05:42.040
Rock Hudson.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.576
- 'Gilligan?'
         - Yeah.

05:44.644 --> 05:48.646
Shhh! Are you asleep?

05:48.715 --> 05:51.716
If I am, I'm doing it with my
eyes open. Too excited to sleep.

05:51.784 --> 05:54.619
You have every right
      to be excited. Just think.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.155
By this time tomorrow,
     you might be a millionaire.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.523
What will you do
            with all that money?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.825
Firstly, I'm gonna buy
something, open that chest.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.494
You really think
I'm a millionaire?

06:02.563 --> 06:04.729
Sure, it's your chest,
       you found it, didn't you?

06:04.798 --> 06:05.563
Yeah.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.398
Well, finders, keepers.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.200
What do you think is in there?

06:09.269 --> 06:13.371
Silver and gold doubloons.
   Maybe even gold bullion.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.508
- Soup?
   - No, Gilligan, not soup.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.245
Whatever it's got,
it's got a lot of it.

06:20.314 --> 06:21.946
Oh, I just wonder
what's in there.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.616
I can hardly
      stand the suspense.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.520
Come to bed, Thurston,
it's getting late.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.689
I can't sleep.
          I just keep wondering.

06:30.758 --> 06:34.225
What wonderful, marvelous
 trinkets must be in that chest?

06:34.294 --> 06:36.094
Thurston, in all the years
   we've been married

06:36.163 --> 06:38.763
I never saw you
     pace the floor before.

06:38.832 --> 06:42.066
Well, of course not. At home,
 I had my butler do it for me.

06:42.135 --> 06:45.169
These islands
         can be so inconvenient.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.272
Are you positive that
treasure chest belongs to you?

06:48.341 --> 06:50.675
Of course, Gilligan was
      working for me at the time

06:50.744 --> 06:52.310
when he was digging
             and found it.

06:52.379 --> 06:56.080
He was in my employee. All
 big business operates that way.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.915
Just wish we could
              open that chest.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.184
But how?

06:59.253 --> 07:01.419
The captain and Gilligan
did everything they could.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.755
They tried everything
but picking the lock.

07:03.824 --> 07:07.759
Picking the lock, Lovey. Like
   on the "Late Late Late Show."

07:07.827 --> 07:09.327
Why don't we try that?

07:09.396 --> 07:12.464
I'll get
my knitting needle.

07:12.532 --> 07:13.865
Gilligan, I just thought
of something.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.767
We didn't think
about picking the lock.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.069
Yeah.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.539
Bobby pin.

07:20.607 --> 07:25.443
I was once in a movie where I
 picked a lock with a bobby pin.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.179
Ginger.

07:30.517 --> 07:31.883
Oh, dear.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.117
Quiet, Lovey.

07:33.186 --> 07:36.521
Thurston, this is fun.
I feel positively criminal.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.858
Skipper, Skipper,
I can hardly wait to find out

07:39.926 --> 07:42.794
if I'm a gold millionaire
or Julian millionaire.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.740
[gasping]

07:55.809 --> 07:57.775
- Good evening.
  - A good evening, yes it is.

07:57.844 --> 08:01.179
A beautiful evening. We're just
out for a breath of fresh air.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.281
No, Skipper,
   remember we came here to--

08:03.350 --> 08:07.686
Gilligan, you know...night air
 is bad for my little buddy.

08:07.754 --> 08:10.488
Shall we, uh, turn in...
for the night?

08:10.557 --> 08:13.992
- Right. Goodnight, ladies.
 - See you all in the morning.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.901
Atta boy, Skipper.
   I knew you'd get it open.

08:23.970 --> 08:27.505
Certainly. Let the weight of the
chest itself break it wide open.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.073
Make it fast.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.543
I still don't see, how you're
gonna open the chest, this way.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.779
Very simple, Mr. Howell. All
 we have to do is cut the vine.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.914
The chest falls,
      and it's own weight

08:36.982 --> 08:38.916
will break those seams wide open
when it hits the ground.

08:38.985 --> 08:41.052
I must say that's very clever.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.890
I must reward you with, uh, part
of my treasure chest.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.358
Your treasure chest?
That treasure is Gilligan's.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.492
Gilligan's?

08:48.561 --> 08:50.561
Of course, he found it.
    Didn't you?

08:50.630 --> 08:52.196
You were with me,
             don't you remember?

08:52.265 --> 08:53.731
Of course, I remember.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.400
But he was working for me.
Therefore, the treasure is mine.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.936
Finders, keepers.

08:58.004 --> 09:01.272
But that's ridiculous. It's
the practice of any corporation.

09:01.341 --> 09:04.042
- Gilligan is not a corporation.
- I'm not even a business.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.544
I still say
  the treasure chest is mine.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.513
- Treasure chest is Gilligan's.
- It's mine.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.916
- Gilligan's.
         - Mine.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.119
- Gilligan?
          - Mine.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.927
- It's only me.
 - I thought it was Mr. Howell.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.962
I came back to help you
         protect your rights.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.098
When Howell wants something,
    he can be pretty tricky.

09:27.167 --> 09:31.469
There you are. I thought I might
find you next to my treasure.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.104
Gilligan's treasure.

09:33.173 --> 09:36.174
Gentlemen, I'm sure there's
 some simple and fair solution.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.875
And what did
               you have in mind?

09:37.944 --> 09:41.312
Nothing specific, perhaps
tossing a coin. Drawing straws.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.715
Oh, what about
a game of cards?

09:43.784 --> 09:46.684
Gentlemen settle differences
with a game of cards.

09:46.753 --> 09:51.289
Now, Lovey, you know
that I know nothing about cards.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.358
- Did I do it right?
    - You did it perfectly.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.995
- I'm a champion poker player.
 - I know.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.464
He fell right
                  into our trap.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.566
I was the best poker player
in the whole of the seven fleet.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.002
We gotta make sure
            that he plays poker.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.207
I think we can be coaxed
    into a little game of cards.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.609
- Where are you gonna get cards?
- Oh, cards?

10:11.678 --> 10:16.414
By a happy coincidence, I just
happen to have a deck of cards.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.349
- One game, winner take all?
  - Yes, agreed.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.618
- Shall we play Gin Rummy?
   - Blackjack.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.520
- Casino. Red Dog.
       - Baccarat. Whist.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.655
Well, anything but poker.
       That's my worst game.

10:24.724 --> 10:28.126
- Mine too, but we'll play.
  - Agreed.

10:31.364 --> 10:36.067
You'll have to excuse me for not
knowing too much about cards.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.703
- I'll cut.
          - Not yet.

10:41.274 --> 10:45.376
(Thurston)
'See, back home, I pay attention
to more important things.'

10:45.445 --> 10:48.479
'Such as...polo playing.'

10:48.548 --> 10:49.914
'Fox hunting.'

10:52.018 --> 10:57.656
But then of course, from time to
time I did watch the boys play.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.927
Now...how many do I deal?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.263
Why six, I think.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.831
Five, isn't it?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.933
He's right.
I think you deal five.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.336
Alright,
               whatever you say.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.406
Now, you may cut.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.925
Now, you may deal.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.794
Ready?

11:39.031 --> 11:41.699
(Professor)
    'Hey, the girls told me
    the fantastic news.'

11:41.768 --> 11:42.967
That's the treasure chest?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.168
(Gilligan)
   'That's right, Professor.'

11:44.237 --> 11:46.637
'It certainly looks like
    the real thing.'

11:46.706 --> 11:48.606
I understand, there is
  a question to the ownership.

11:48.674 --> 11:50.941
That's why we're playing one
game of poker, winner take all.

11:51.010 --> 11:54.212
Back home we'd never play cards
for anything so important.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.447
But back home, there are laws
 about such things.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.049
This fellow was in my employee.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.451
Well, the law says
              finders, keepers.

12:00.519 --> 12:03.721
If you're interested in law,
    only one way to settle it.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.323
- A court trial.
     - A court trial here?

12:06.392 --> 12:07.459
Why not?

12:07.527 --> 12:11.262
As the law says "Lex Loci Lex
Scripta Lexi Ta Ra

12:11.331 --> 12:12.630
'Nemo Solos Ab oath.'"

12:12.698 --> 12:16.501
- What does that mean?
 - Your case comes up Tuesday.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.739
You both agree to a trial
  to establish the ownership.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.007
Right, Mr. Howell?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.576
- Of course. I have legal right.
- Gilligan?

12:25.645 --> 12:28.946
Skipper says I'm not allowed to
 talk to anyone except attorney.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.982
- Well, who's your attorney?
  - Skipper.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.384
I'll pay you a thousand dollars
to represent me.

12:33.453 --> 12:37.822
- But he's gonna be the judge.
  - I'll double the offer.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.958
Public official, Mr. Howell.

12:41.527 --> 12:45.964
No more of you evasive replies.
Just answer yes or no.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.833
Did I or did I not hire you
  to dig the barbeque pit

12:48.902 --> 12:50.968
which resulted in your finding
the treasure chest?

12:51.037 --> 12:53.270
Thurston, that's very good.
     You're bound to win.

12:53.339 --> 12:56.507
Lovey, you see, this is
an open and shut case.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.343
While I did hire Gilligan,
I didn't actually pay him.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.512
And the Skipper might
use that as a loop hole.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.482
Loop hole! Oh, you know
         all the legal terms.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.718
Why not? After all I watched
Perry Mason for six years.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.753
But I can close
that loop hole, if..

13:09.822 --> 13:11.022
If what, dear?

13:11.091 --> 13:15.960
If I can get Gilligan
to take the money now.

13:18.832 --> 13:22.367
Oh, there you are, I've been
  looking all over for you.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.135
Oh, you have?
    I've been right up here.

13:24.203 --> 13:27.839
Yes, I wanna pay you for
the work that you did for me.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.775
But I never finished digging
  the pit, I dug for 10 minutes.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.477
At least let me pay
for the time that you dug.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.046
One hundred dollars be enough?

13:35.115 --> 13:38.049
A hundred dollars? That's almost
five hundred dollars an hour.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.852
Six hundred,
but who's counting.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.421
Gilligan, don't take that money.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.290
Why not, Skipper?

13:46.359 --> 13:48.092
Gilligan, he's hoping that
   you'll take the money

13:48.161 --> 13:50.995
because it'll strengthen
his claim on the treasure chest.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.698
From now on, Mr. Howell, you are
not to talk to my client.

13:53.767 --> 13:56.067
Alright. I'll see you in court.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.460
Ah. O-oh. O-oh.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.342
Hi, Gilligan.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.011
Oh, hi, Ginger.
I'm just ironing my shirt.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.581
My lawyer said I gotta look
the best for the trial.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.215
- You're cute.
         - Ow.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.752
- Skipper's not here.
  - I didn't come to see him.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.287
Well, the Professor's
not here either.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.390
- I came to see you.
      - Oh, yeah?

14:52.459 --> 14:54.959
Ever since I've been
            on this Island

14:55.028 --> 14:58.061
I've been forcing myself
        to stay away from you.

14:58.130 --> 15:01.265
Just to fool the Skipper
        and the Professor.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.201
You fooled me
pretty good too.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.735
Look at me, Gilligan.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.371
Can't you tell what I've got
    bottled up inside of me?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.507
No, but it's sure
trying to get out.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.141
Let me tell you how--

15:10.210 --> 15:12.410
O-oh, you're hot.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.579
Just my buttons.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.648
Would you
                  do me a favor?

15:17.717 --> 15:20.218
(Ginger)
 'Forget about that old chest.'

15:20.287 --> 15:22.887
'I mean, just admit that you
 were working for Mr. Howell.'

15:22.956 --> 15:24.888
- Okay?
          - Yeah and..

15:24.957 --> 15:27.024
And?

15:27.093 --> 15:29.360
You can stay away
       from Gilligan.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.730
Ginger, you can go
back to Mr. Howell

15:32.799 --> 15:34.699
and tell him that
it didn't work.

15:36.135 --> 15:37.301
That's right, Gilligan.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.236
It's not only important
    to tell the truth

15:39.305 --> 15:42.239
but it's also important
    how you tell it.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.641
Let's get the story straight,
   right from the beginning.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.911
Okay, you told me to cut
some bamboo for a fish trap.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.413
Mr. Howell said
he had a job--

15:49.482 --> 15:51.749
Hold it.
               Did he say "job?"

15:51.817 --> 15:52.750
No.

15:52.818 --> 15:54.385
Then don't mention it.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.487
Now, remember
                the five points.

15:56.555 --> 15:58.622
If you're struck
  at the trial, look over to me.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.092
I'll give you an answer
         by holding up a finger.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.327
Now, let's try.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.763
Mr. Howell wants you
    to do something for him.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.665
Shows you where he wanted
   the barbeque pit.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.334
'He never mentioned
      the word "job."'

16:10.403 --> 16:13.871
Never talked about money.
  And never paid you a penny.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.840
- Now, you got that?
      - Yeah.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.675
- What's that?
         - Your thumb.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.645
No, it's Mr. Howell, asking
  you to do something for him.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.648
Oh, I see.
  That's pretty good, Skipper.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.017
What's that?

16:26.085 --> 16:29.386
Mr. Howell never paid me
    a single pinkie...penny.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.321
Right, Gilligan.
                Remember that.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.190
(Gilligan)
     'Don't worry, Skipper,
     I'll remember.'

16:33.259 --> 16:36.761
(Skipper)
  'You'll remember, even if we
  have to sit up all night.'

16:36.830 --> 16:39.196
Tampering with the witness.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.932
I'll file charges.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.735
Now, Mr. Howell,
        take it easy.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.004
Tell me again,
   what were his exact words?

16:46.072 --> 16:47.739
Gilligan said
      that he'd get it straight.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.241
Skipper said he'd make sure,
    but took all night.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.509
So, I want to prepare charges
   in court.

16:52.578 --> 16:56.280
Counsel has the right to go over
testimony with his client.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.083
- Whose side are you on?
  - I'm not on anybody's side.

16:59.151 --> 17:02.653
Oh, you're not.
         I'll take care of that.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.555
All over again.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.326
Hey, I wonder what's
going on over there.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.962
I hope you're not thinking
of offering me a bribe.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.732
Of course not. You recall
       two weeks ago at dinner

17:14.800 --> 17:17.367
when I asked someone to pass me
 the juice and you did.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.871
Well, I want
            to pay you for that.

17:19.939 --> 17:23.273
- Five thousand dollars?
    - No, no, no.

17:23.342 --> 17:26.242
I caught you red handed. Trying
to bribe a public official.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.846
Your Honor,
I want to file charges.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.480
First trial hasn't even started

17:30.549 --> 17:33.284
and I've already got
 two more cases on the docket.

17:38.657 --> 17:40.124
Are you ready?

17:41.161 --> 17:43.493
Everyone take their places.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.797
The first superior court of this
island is now in session.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.933
(Skipper)
    'The Honorable Professor
    presiding.'

17:49.001 --> 17:50.668
Be seated.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.705
Since everyone is familiar
with the case, we will dispense

17:54.773 --> 17:56.874
with the reading of the
  complaint encounter charges.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.944
Skipper, you may call
     your first witness.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.012
- 'I object.'
         - To what?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.647
I want to call
      my witnesses first.

18:03.716 --> 18:04.915
But Mr. Howell--

18:04.984 --> 18:07.117
'You don't let me, I'm gonna
  take back my cape.'

18:07.186 --> 18:09.620
Professor, that is Your Honor.

18:09.688 --> 18:11.255
It's perfectly alright
          with me

18:11.324 --> 18:13.357
if Mr. Howell calls
            his witnesses first.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.927
Alright, Mr. Howell.
You may call your first witness.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.527
Thank you.

18:17.596 --> 18:23.467
I call as my first witness,
  a Mrs. Thurston Howell III.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.537
(Thurston)
     'Mrs. Howell, you may
     take the stand.'

18:32.979 --> 18:36.147
Mrs. Thurston Howell III, will
  you tell the court the events

18:36.215 --> 18:38.949
that took place
         the morning of the 5th?

18:39.018 --> 18:41.285
Oh, Thurston,
that was beautiful.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.620
You really ought
to be on the defenders.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.723
But you forgot to point
your finger at me.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.990
Your Honor, I object.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.826
What are you objecting to?

18:48.895 --> 18:51.795
Your Honor, I feel that
they've rehearsed her testimony.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.698
No more than he's
             rehearsed Gilligan.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.365
You brought me up
in court on charges?

18:55.434 --> 18:57.067
I want to file charges,
Your Honor.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.837
Alright, but wait your turn.
  That'll be Case number 4.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.040
Now, please. Let us get
    on with the testimony.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.175
Your Honor, would you mind
      getting another gavel?

19:05.244 --> 19:06.277
Why?

19:06.346 --> 19:08.546
That one's
                 squirting milk.

19:10.516 --> 19:13.884
Please. Let's get on
      with the case.

19:13.953 --> 19:17.721
- Mrs. Howell, if you please?
 - Now, let's see.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.324
That was the morning that
  Mr. Howell offered Gilligan

19:20.393 --> 19:24.228
a job, and he agreed
    to dig the barbeque pit.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.330
Thank you very much,
            Mrs. Howell.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.100
Your witness.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.703
Watch me break her testimony.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.240
Mrs. Howell.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.777
Did Mr. Howell
use those exact words?

19:39.845 --> 19:41.946
That he had a job for him?

19:42.015 --> 19:43.414
Or did he say that
he had something

19:43.482 --> 19:46.150
that he wanted Gilligan
to do for him?

19:46.219 --> 19:49.353
- I object.
   - What is your objection?

19:49.422 --> 19:52.556
Just gimme a minute.
        I'll think of something.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.893
Ms. Ginger Grant.
            Just tell the court.

19:55.962 --> 19:59.597
Do you recall hearing me say
    that I was hiring Gilligan?

19:59.665 --> 20:02.299
Yes, Mr. Howell. You told me
that you'd just hired him

20:02.368 --> 20:03.800
to dig the barbecue pit.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.136
Howell bribed her. Same way
     he tried to bribe you.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.738
That's defamation
               of character.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.140
I want to sue that man
          for libel and slander.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.410
That'll be Case number 5.

20:14.314 --> 20:17.280
He said I was bribed.
I want to file charges too.

20:17.349 --> 20:20.017
Case number 6.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.720
Your Honor, I do wish that
      you get another gavel.

20:23.789 --> 20:26.957
- Ginger's very damaging to us.
 - Yeah. Her testimony.

20:27.025 --> 20:28.993
No.
                       Her legs.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.329
I'd gone to ask Gilligan if I
could help with his fish trap.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.999
He said he first had to do
a favor for Mr. Howell.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.067
Aha! It was a favor.

20:37.135 --> 20:39.803
Your Honor, I want to file
      charges against Mary Ann.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.006
(Professor)
       'Against Mary Ann?
       For what?'

20:42.075 --> 20:44.342
For murder.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.711
- Murder?
 - Her testimony's killing me.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.147
Did Mr. Howell
     at any time, call it a job?

20:50.215 --> 20:51.348
No.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.484
Did he pay you
               any money for it?

20:53.552 --> 20:55.252
No.

20:55.321 --> 20:56.687
[whispering]
                 Nice testimony.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.188
If you get stuck
                for an answer

20:58.257 --> 20:59.890
during the rest
        of the trial, look at me

20:59.958 --> 21:03.294
and I'll hold up a finger.
      Your witness, Mr. Howell.

21:06.799 --> 21:11.702
Gilligan, my boy. Isn't it true
 that I hired you that morning?

21:15.574 --> 21:18.676
You asked me if I'd time
to do something for you.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.815
You never paid me
a single penny.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.517
I didn't ask that.

21:26.585 --> 21:28.986
(Gilligan)
   'You showed me where you
   wanted the barbeque pit.'

21:29.055 --> 21:30.321
Your Honor.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.789
You never talked about
something for me

21:32.858 --> 21:34.992
the penny mention
work of barbeque pit.

21:36.762 --> 21:38.629
Your Honor. They are
      using signals.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.964
- I want to file charges.
  - You have to wait for mine.

21:41.033 --> 21:44.402
- Order in the court!
     - Watch it.

21:46.872 --> 21:48.138
Professor is thinking
for half an hour.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.573
What's he thinking about?

21:49.641 --> 21:52.443
Sit down, Gilligan.
   You're making me nervous.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.382
Oh. Alright, everybody.
   The judge is coming back.

22:03.589 --> 22:06.090
Ladies and gentlemen,
        I've reached a decision.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.258
Oh, don't keep the boy
          waiting any longer.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.461
- Tell them I won the verdict.
 - Oh, I can't tell that.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.797
Gilligan, that means that
the treasure chest is yours.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.698
Wait, wait.
     Gilligan didn't win either.

22:14.766 --> 22:17.067
- Huh?
       - Let me explain.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.136
Ever since we were shipwrecked
  on this island, we've shared

22:19.205 --> 22:21.938
the hardships, the work,
    the fish we catch, the fruit

22:22.007 --> 22:23.607
'the water, everything.'

22:23.676 --> 22:25.676
We shared
         and we've shared alike.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.478
I choose to look upon
           the treasure chest

22:27.547 --> 22:29.746
as one of the natural resources
 of this island.

22:29.815 --> 22:33.550
By custom and usage, de facto.
 It belongs to all of us.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.753
Let's go open it.
Come on.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.094
Wait!
   Don't cut that, Professor.

22:44.163 --> 22:47.565
I've got to own that treasure
chest. Now, no one has seen it.

22:47.633 --> 22:50.167
I'll give you a $100,000
  for your five shares of it.

22:50.236 --> 22:53.737
- Hundred thousand dollars?
  - That's $20,000 a piece.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.873
- I'll take the treasure chest.
- Me too.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.742
- The treasure.
   - Cut the vine, Professor.

22:58.810 --> 23:02.413
Stop! Two hundred
  and fifty thousand dollars.

23:06.285 --> 23:09.086
Stop.
       A half a million.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.921
Huh! It's a 100,000 a piece.

23:13.492 --> 23:15.559
- Yeah.
            - Yes.

23:15.628 --> 23:18.963
Mr. Howell, you just bought
  yourself a treasure.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.874
Look at that.
    Big-giant-black pearls.

23:31.710 --> 23:36.213
Oh. I wonder what they did
to get a little oyster

23:36.281 --> 23:38.449
to make a pearl this size.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.117
Must have used whips.

23:42.321 --> 23:45.856
No! No!
             It's a cannon ball.

23:50.028 --> 23:51.929
[crying]

23:59.872 --> 24:02.339
It was sporting of all of you
   not to accept the money.

24:02.407 --> 24:05.142
We couldn't. We all thought
there was treasure in the chest.

24:05.210 --> 24:08.746
I still say it was sporting.
    It's stupid, but sporting.

24:08.814 --> 24:12.750
- Darling, it's your toss.
   - Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

24:19.759 --> 24:24.094
That's pretty good, Mr. Howell.
You got two, four, six boards.

24:28.267 --> 24:32.870
Well, as I always say the family
that bowls together...splits.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.982
¶ Now this is the tale
     of our castaways ¶

24:45.051 --> 24:47.250
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

24:47.319 --> 24:49.119
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

24:49.188 --> 24:50.987
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

24:51.056 --> 24:53.023
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

24:53.092 --> 24:55.859
¶ Will do their very best ¶

24:55.928 --> 24:58.061
¶ To make
    the others comfortable ¶

24:58.130 --> 25:00.297
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:00.366 --> 25:02.665
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motorcars ¶

25:02.734 --> 25:04.801
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:04.870 --> 25:06.803
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:06.872 --> 25:09.173
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:09.241 --> 25:11.374
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:11.443 --> 25:13.611
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:13.679 --> 25:15.946
¶ From seven
      stranded castaways ¶

25:16.015 --> 25:18.015
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
