WEBVTT

00:01.518 --> 00:04.107
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.245 --> 00:07.317
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.455 --> 00:11.873
To a deluxe apartment
In the sky

00:12.012 --> 00:14.842
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.980 --> 00:17.810
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.948 --> 00:21.745
We've finally got
A piece of the pie

00:23.540 --> 00:26.026
Fish don't fry
In the kitchen

00:26.164 --> 00:28.752
Beans don't burn
On the grill

00:28.890 --> 00:31.238
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.376 --> 00:33.999
Just to get up that hill

00:34.137 --> 00:36.588
Now we're up
In the big leagues

00:36.726 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.246 --> 00:41.731
As long as we live
It's you and me, baby

00:41.869 --> 00:43.353
There ain't nothin'
Wrong with that

00:43.491 --> 00:46.218
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.356 --> 00:49.221
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.359 --> 00:53.812
To a deluxe apartment
In the sky

00:53.950 --> 00:56.711
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.849 --> 00:59.818
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.956 --> 01:04.478
We've finally got
A piece of the pie

01:11.519 --> 01:12.555
I gotta say, George,

01:12.693 --> 01:14.936
I am very impressed
with your setup here.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.283
You got all
the latest equipment.

01:16.421 --> 01:17.836
Oh, look, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

01:17.974 --> 01:19.355
Next week we're getting
this machine

01:19.493 --> 01:21.253
that not only rips
the buttons off your shirt,

01:21.391 --> 01:23.393
it writes a note of apology
at the same time.

01:26.534 --> 01:27.777
Yeah.

01:27.915 --> 01:29.537
Here, you might as well
look these contracts over.

01:29.675 --> 01:31.021
Okay.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.885
I think my restaurant chain
and the Jefferson cleaners

01:33.023 --> 01:34.301
can do a little
business together.

01:34.439 --> 01:35.716
Wrong.

01:35.854 --> 01:37.752
We're gonna do a lot
of business together.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.996
Your dirty tablecloths
are my worry from now on.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.515
But I don't mind,

01:41.653 --> 01:43.379
because there's
lots of gravy
in that there gravy!

01:45.760 --> 01:46.727
Hi, Pop.

01:46.865 --> 01:48.832
Hey, Lionel.
Glad you dropped in.

01:48.970 --> 01:50.317
I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine.

01:50.455 --> 01:51.904
Frank Howard, a future
business associate
of mine.

01:52.042 --> 01:54.666
This is my son Lionel.
He's an engineer.
Smart as a whip.

01:54.804 --> 01:56.288
How are you doing?
Hi, Lionel.

01:56.426 --> 01:57.393
A pleasure to meet you.

01:57.531 --> 01:58.842
Can I talk to you
for a minute, Pop?

01:58.980 --> 01:59.981
Sure. Excuse me
a minute, Frank.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.845
Sure.

02:01.983 --> 02:03.157
What can
I do for you, son?

02:03.295 --> 02:05.642
Look, Pop, Mom and I
have been thinking.

02:05.780 --> 02:08.093
You know Jenny's folks
are having an anniversary
next week.

02:08.231 --> 02:09.439
That's their problem.

02:11.338 --> 02:12.718
Now, wait a minute.

02:12.856 --> 02:15.273
Look, we're the only family
that the Willises really have.

02:15.411 --> 02:16.998
Their own parents never
get together with them.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.724
That's because
they got good taste.

02:19.794 --> 02:21.279
Now, listen, Pop.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.384
Look, we were thinking,
it would be a great idea

02:23.522 --> 02:24.661
if you could throw
a party for them.

02:24.799 --> 02:26.387
It would kind of cement
the family together.

02:26.525 --> 02:27.837
Now, what do you think?

02:27.975 --> 02:30.253
Yeah. I think the Willises
would look great in cement.

02:31.875 --> 02:33.532
Come on, Pop!
I'm serious.

02:33.670 --> 02:34.878
No, you ain't.
You're dumb.
Pop!

02:35.016 --> 02:36.259
Look, ain't no way

02:36.397 --> 02:38.123
I'm throwing no party
for no Willises, no dice.

02:38.261 --> 02:39.400
That's your last word?

02:39.538 --> 02:41.816
No. I got three more.
Stop wasting my time.

02:43.370 --> 02:44.957
Okay.
Forget it!

02:49.652 --> 02:51.619
Your son upset
about something?

02:51.757 --> 02:53.138
He'll get over it.

02:53.276 --> 02:54.415
He bought himself
a lot of trouble

02:54.553 --> 02:55.934
and wants me
to help him with it.

02:56.072 --> 02:57.315
What kind of trouble?

02:57.453 --> 02:59.213
Well, he married into
one of them
mixed-up families.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.974
What do you mean,
"mixed-up"?

03:02.630 --> 03:03.735
Zebra city.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.982
He's white, she's black,
the kid's a medium-rare.

03:12.778 --> 03:13.883
But that's what happens

03:14.021 --> 03:15.919
when you're dumb enough
to marry the wrong color.

03:17.956 --> 03:19.785
Ah, yes, ma'am,
what can I do for you?

03:19.923 --> 03:21.304
No, you can't do
anything for her

03:21.442 --> 03:22.616
but I'll do
something for you.

03:22.754 --> 03:24.204
Jean, this is
George Jefferson.

03:24.342 --> 03:26.827
George, I'd like for you
to meet Mrs. Howard,
my wife.

03:34.421 --> 03:36.285
I'm so happy
to meet you.

03:40.081 --> 03:42.877
Look... Look, did I come
too soon or something?

03:43.015 --> 03:45.121
No. As a matter of fact
we just finished.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.847
Wait a minute, Frank,
you got me all wrong.

03:46.985 --> 03:48.089
No, I've got you
right, George.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.230
I was just making
in-law jokes.

03:50.368 --> 03:53.302
Everybody makes
in-law jokes.
Black, white, yellow.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.200
How about zebras?

03:55.338 --> 03:57.340
That was just to make
the joke funnier.

03:59.411 --> 04:01.171
That don't mean
I really feel that way.

04:01.310 --> 04:02.483
Yeah, right,
George.

04:02.621 --> 04:04.416
Don't mind my husband,
Mr. Jefferson.

04:04.554 --> 04:07.419
He's a little oversensitive
on the subject of race.

04:07.557 --> 04:09.041
Oh, I see.

04:09.179 --> 04:11.527
Well, look, you two
don't have to feel
uncomfortable around me.

04:11.665 --> 04:14.599
I mean, hell, some of
my best friends
are black-and-white.

04:16.704 --> 04:18.258
Like my good friends
the Willises.

04:18.396 --> 04:21.537
Lovely people,
especially him.
He's the white one.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.643
Okay, we believe you.
Goodbye, George.

04:24.781 --> 04:26.404
Wait a minute.
We ain't signed nothing yet.

04:26.542 --> 04:28.337
That's right.

04:28.475 --> 04:30.511
Look, Frank,
I wanna prove to you

04:30.649 --> 04:32.202
that I'm not the kind of guy
you think I am.

04:32.341 --> 04:35.723
It just so happens
that my dear, warm,
close in-laws the Willises

04:35.861 --> 04:37.138
are coming over
for dinner tomorrow night.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.900
I'd like you two to join us.
Seven-thirty sound okay?

04:40.038 --> 04:41.798
Sounds okay to me.
Jean, look...

04:41.936 --> 04:43.317
No, Frank. Come on.

04:43.455 --> 04:45.215
Now, Mr. Jefferson
is bending over backwards

04:45.354 --> 04:46.596
to show you that
you're wrong about him.

04:46.734 --> 04:48.184
You'll love
the Willises.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.392
Frank.

04:50.531 --> 04:51.739
All right,
we'll come to dinner.

04:52.568 --> 04:53.948
Out of sight!

04:54.086 --> 04:55.122
We'll get to know
each other better.

04:55.260 --> 04:56.848
And one thing you'll
learn about me, Frank:

04:56.986 --> 05:00.092
The color of a person's skin
don't matter to me.

05:00.230 --> 05:01.784
I'm glad to hear that,
George.

05:04.234 --> 05:05.270
I'll see you
tomorrow evening.

05:05.408 --> 05:06.513
Right, Frank.

05:06.651 --> 05:07.928
Looking forward
to seeing you, Mrs. White.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.282
Howard.

05:26.567 --> 05:28.811
Hey, Weezy,
the table looks great!

05:28.949 --> 05:31.400
Oh, thank you.

05:31.538 --> 05:34.472
I'm really looking forward
to meeting the Howards.

05:34.610 --> 05:37.544
And I'm so pleased you asked
the Willises to join us.

05:37.682 --> 05:39.269
I just can't
get over that.

05:39.408 --> 05:40.650
Ain't no big thing.

05:40.788 --> 05:42.549
I mean, the Willises and I
have had our differences

05:42.687 --> 05:43.860
but they're
part of the family now.

05:43.998 --> 05:45.241
Oh, that's nice.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.587
Maybe not the front part.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.244
George!

05:48.382 --> 05:50.936
Just kidding.
I love 'em. I love 'em.

05:51.074 --> 05:52.317
Maybe now you'll throw

05:52.455 --> 05:54.457
that anniversary party
for the Willises.

05:54.595 --> 05:56.563
I don't love them
that much.

05:56.701 --> 05:59.876
Hey, wait a minute.
How come that avocado dip
looks so funny?

06:00.739 --> 06:02.396
Because
it's clam dip.

06:05.710 --> 06:07.436
Green clam dip?

06:07.574 --> 06:08.989
Well, it didn't
look too appetizing

06:09.127 --> 06:10.300
sitting there
all lumpy and white

06:10.439 --> 06:11.681
so I decided
to fix it up.

06:13.787 --> 06:15.858
How does it taste?

06:15.996 --> 06:18.032
How come clam dip
that looks like
avocado dip

06:18.170 --> 06:19.482
tastes like peppermint?

06:20.863 --> 06:22.243
What do you think
turned it green?

06:24.107 --> 06:25.661
Peppermint
clam dip?

06:27.317 --> 06:29.837
It sweetens your breath
while it sours your stomach.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.254
But I hate
peppermint.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.773
Good. Because that's
for your guests.

06:36.534 --> 06:37.914
That's the door,
Florence.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.571
It sure is.

06:47.337 --> 06:49.132
Never mind, George.
I'll get it.

06:51.065 --> 06:52.584
Oh, hi.
Come on in.

06:52.722 --> 06:53.999
Hi, Louise.
Hi, Louise.

06:54.137 --> 06:55.656
George,
it's Tom and Helen.

06:55.794 --> 06:59.660
Well, well, well,
it's my favorite in-laws,
the Willises!

06:59.798 --> 07:02.560
Am I glad to see you.
Thank you for coming.

07:02.698 --> 07:04.734
Have a seat.
Make yourselves
comfortable.

07:06.011 --> 07:07.599
Tom, would you
please pinch me?

07:08.773 --> 07:10.291
Sure. May I
pick my spot?

07:12.121 --> 07:13.605
I just wanna make sure
I'm not dreaming.

07:13.743 --> 07:15.745
I've never felt
so welcome before.

07:15.883 --> 07:17.678
Well, don't
fight the feeling.

07:17.816 --> 07:19.577
George has turned over
a new leaf

07:19.715 --> 07:22.096
and I think it's wonderful.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.339
Okay,
what'll it be?

07:23.477 --> 07:24.961
I'll have a glass
of wine, please.

07:25.099 --> 07:26.998
What about you,
Tom, old buddy?

07:27.861 --> 07:29.587
Scotch, please.
Coming up.

07:31.209 --> 07:34.833
How about this?
No arguments, no insults.
Isn't this nice, Helen?

07:34.971 --> 07:36.663
Well, it's different.

07:36.801 --> 07:39.838
I know what you mean, Helen.
I can't get over it myself.

07:39.976 --> 07:42.807
George just decided to
accept things as they are

07:42.945 --> 07:44.533
for the sake of
the families.

07:44.671 --> 07:45.982
What's so strange
about that?

07:46.120 --> 07:48.606
A man can't keep his head
buried in sand all his life.

07:48.744 --> 07:50.262
You almost made it.

07:52.644 --> 07:54.439
Now, don't start
anything, Helen.

07:54.577 --> 07:57.856
It's about time
Lionel and Jenny had
a family they can enjoy.

07:57.994 --> 07:59.686
Not like our in-laws.

07:59.824 --> 08:03.137
Your parents have never
gotten over the fact
that I'm white.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.139
That's because you never
got over being white.

08:06.831 --> 08:08.073
Just kidding.

08:09.868 --> 08:12.388
I just wanted to show you
what the old George
used to be like.

08:13.976 --> 08:16.806
I can still remember
what the old George
used to be like

08:16.944 --> 08:18.394
as if it were
only yesterday.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.154
It was only yesterday.

08:22.087 --> 08:24.296
I think there's something
wrong with this Scotch.

08:24.434 --> 08:25.470
What are you
talking about?

08:25.608 --> 08:27.403
That's 12-year-old Scotch,
best in the house.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.509
That's what's
wrong with it!
Huh?

08:29.647 --> 08:31.303
What happened to that
6-week-old stuff

08:31.441 --> 08:32.857
you used to
give me?

08:32.995 --> 08:34.099
I threw that
garbage out.

08:34.237 --> 08:36.516
Nothing but the best
for you from now on.

08:36.654 --> 08:37.827
What do you say
to that, Helen?

08:37.965 --> 08:39.967
I believe. I believe!

08:41.382 --> 08:42.729
Say, maybe now you two

08:42.867 --> 08:44.454
could come up to our place
for dinner some time.

08:44.593 --> 08:46.664
Oh, sure, sure.

08:46.802 --> 08:48.493
How about next week?
How about next year?

08:49.494 --> 08:50.460
What?

08:50.599 --> 08:51.945
Well, I don't wanna
become a pest.

08:53.187 --> 08:54.672
Oh, I see your table
is set for six.

08:54.810 --> 08:56.570
Who else is coming?
Anyone we know?

08:56.708 --> 09:00.091
I don't think so.
Frank and Jean Howard.

09:00.229 --> 09:03.301
Frank and George might be
doing business together.

09:03.439 --> 09:06.304
You're gonna love them.
You'll find you have
a lot in common.

09:09.859 --> 09:10.998
Oh? Like what?

09:14.243 --> 09:15.278
Lots of things. Like...

09:15.416 --> 09:17.039
Is he in the
publishing business?

09:17.177 --> 09:19.800
Uh, no. He owns
a chain of restaurants.

09:19.938 --> 09:21.077
Do they live in
this neighborhood?

09:21.215 --> 09:22.562
Uh, no.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.908
Do they go
to our church?

09:24.046 --> 09:25.150
Uh-uh.

09:25.288 --> 09:26.358
Are they a man
and a woman?

09:26.496 --> 09:27.601
Yeah!

09:28.844 --> 09:30.639
Then that's it.

09:30.777 --> 09:32.710
There's more,
isn't there, George?

09:32.848 --> 09:36.196
Are the Howards
by any chance
an interracial couple?

09:36.334 --> 09:37.646
I don't know.
I never noticed.

09:37.784 --> 09:38.923
HELEN: Uh-huh.

09:40.510 --> 09:43.030
I know. We're here because
we're just like them, huh?

09:43.168 --> 09:45.032
That's baloney.
You ain't nothing like them.

09:45.170 --> 09:46.724
He's black
and she's white.

09:49.450 --> 09:51.211
George, you didn't
tell me that...

09:51.349 --> 09:52.557
Of course
he didn't.

09:52.695 --> 09:53.869
Because then you would know
what he was up to.

09:54.007 --> 09:55.905
That's right.
We'd all know
what he was up to.

09:56.526 --> 09:57.735
What's he up to?

09:58.805 --> 10:00.289
Exploiting us.

10:00.427 --> 10:02.015
George exploiting you?

10:02.153 --> 10:04.465
Certainly. He's using us
to get to the Howards.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.882
We're nothing but
his token zebra couple.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.331
Let's go, Helen.

10:08.469 --> 10:09.885
Wait a minute.
You got me all wrong.

10:10.023 --> 10:12.370
It's just a coincidence that
they're mixed-up like you.

10:12.508 --> 10:13.820
I mean, I really
want you to stay.

10:14.924 --> 10:16.512
Well, what do
you say, Helen?

10:16.650 --> 10:17.996
Well...

10:18.134 --> 10:20.102
Because if you leave now,
you'll blow a big deal for me.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.069
Now do you see
what he's up to?

10:22.207 --> 10:23.346
Let's get
out of here.

10:26.177 --> 10:29.042
Well, Mr. Wonderful,
you've done it again.

10:29.180 --> 10:31.216
How could you do that
to Tom and Helen?

10:31.354 --> 10:32.632
Don't get on me
now, Weezy.

10:32.770 --> 10:34.357
I got more important things
to think about.

10:34.495 --> 10:36.290
Like what?

10:36.428 --> 10:38.327
Like where am I gonna find
another integrated couple
this time of night?

10:39.949 --> 10:41.502
That's all right,
Mrs. Jefferson,
I'll get that.

10:42.262 --> 10:43.401
Don't answer that door.

10:43.539 --> 10:44.782
Why not?
You gotta go
to the bathroom.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.507
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

10:48.751 --> 10:50.684
Why?
Because your slip
is showing!

10:52.652 --> 10:55.206
Hi! Louise,
it's the Howards.

10:55.344 --> 10:56.725
LOUISE: Hello.

10:56.863 --> 10:58.036
Hey.
Hi, George.

10:58.174 --> 10:59.313
I'm sorry
we're late.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.832
You're not late.
You're the first.

11:00.970 --> 11:02.938
Oh, the Willises
aren't here yet?

11:03.076 --> 11:04.180
No. But
they're coming.

11:05.078 --> 11:06.769
They are?
They'll be here any minute.

11:06.907 --> 11:08.150
But they just...

11:08.288 --> 11:10.462
They just called to say
they're coming right down.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.335
Well, now,
isn't this nice?

11:22.578 --> 11:24.684
Oh, Weezy, I gotta
get this door fixed.

11:26.789 --> 11:28.618
Well, don't just
stand there, Weezy,
show our guests around.

11:28.757 --> 11:31.104
But, George!
Starting with the kitchen.

11:31.242 --> 11:33.037
Well, maybe they'd like
to freshen up first.

11:33.175 --> 11:35.073
Weezy, they already
freshened up before
they left the house.

11:35.211 --> 11:36.661
See how clean they look.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.803
We'd love to see
the kitchen,
wouldn't we, Frank?

11:40.941 --> 11:43.150
Yeah, that sounds like
a real thrill.

11:44.876 --> 11:46.498
Take your time, Weezy.
Don't rush around.

11:46.636 --> 11:48.328
I'm sure they wanna
see everything.

11:52.021 --> 11:53.851
What's the big idea,
Mr. Jefferson?
Shh!

11:53.989 --> 11:56.232
My slip ain't showing.
I ain't even wearing no slip.

11:58.648 --> 11:59.719
Florence, dear...

11:59.857 --> 12:02.756
Uh-oh, look out, Florence,
here comes trouble.

12:02.894 --> 12:04.447
Florence dear, I want you
to do me a favor.

12:04.585 --> 12:06.691
Big trouble.
Come on, Florence!

12:06.829 --> 12:08.831
All I want you to do
is pretend to be
Helen Willis.

12:08.969 --> 12:11.523
Pretend to be Mrs. Willis?
What for?

12:11.661 --> 12:13.008
For 10 minutes.
You're crazy.

12:13.146 --> 12:15.010
A week off
with full pay.

12:15.148 --> 12:16.425
You're beginning
to make more sense.

12:17.495 --> 12:19.911
Good.
This ain't something
bad, is it?

12:20.049 --> 12:21.879
Florence, would I
do something bad?

12:22.017 --> 12:23.466
Is Jimmy Carter
Baptist?

12:25.883 --> 12:27.747
How could it be bad?
It's business!

12:27.885 --> 12:29.679
All I want you to do
is act like Helen,

12:29.818 --> 12:31.198
say you've got a headache
and go home.

12:31.336 --> 12:33.200
How can I go home
when I'm already home?

12:33.338 --> 12:34.615
Pretend to go home!

12:34.754 --> 12:36.894
And how am I gonna
look like Mrs. Willis?

12:37.032 --> 12:39.137
You just stick your nose
in the air, talk proper

12:39.275 --> 12:40.242
and put on
your best dress.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.381
My best dress?

12:41.519 --> 12:42.762
That'll cost extra.
You got it.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.384
Now go in the bedroom
and get changed.

12:47.249 --> 12:48.560
Oh, good evening,
Mr. Jefferson, sir.

12:48.698 --> 12:50.321
Here's that extra
Scotch you ordered.

12:50.459 --> 12:51.909
Oh, yeah, Ralph, thanks.

12:53.186 --> 12:54.566
Haven't you forgotten
something, sir?

12:54.704 --> 12:56.534
Later, Ralph.
I've got a problem here.

12:56.672 --> 12:58.501
Ralph. Hey!

12:58.639 --> 13:00.676
That's it.
You're number two.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.747
Well, sir,
I do try harder.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.890
Am I glad to see you.

13:08.028 --> 13:09.374
Well, thank you, sir.

13:09.512 --> 13:10.824
LOUISE: And, of course,
the living room.

13:12.999 --> 13:15.277
Well, it's lovely.
You've decorated it
beautifully.

13:15.415 --> 13:17.003
Thank you. Would you
like to see the bedrooms?

13:17.141 --> 13:19.591
No bedrooms.
The bedrooms are out.

13:19.729 --> 13:22.249
What?
Not till they've
seen the view.

13:22.387 --> 13:24.527
I'm sure the Howards
would love to see
the terrace.

13:24.665 --> 13:26.633
We would?
Absolutely.

13:26.771 --> 13:28.462
George, it's cold
out there.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.396
It's good cold.
It's healthy for you.

13:31.534 --> 13:34.365
Smell that air.
Look at the view!

13:34.503 --> 13:36.470
But, George,
it's freezing!

13:36.608 --> 13:39.370
That's when
the air's clearest.
Come on out, Weezy.

13:39.508 --> 13:40.750
Enjoy yourselves.

13:46.756 --> 13:47.723
Ralph, where
are you going?

13:47.861 --> 13:49.207
I can take a hint, sir.

13:49.345 --> 13:51.865
Look, Ralph,
listen carefully because
I don't have much time.

13:52.003 --> 13:54.454
I want you
to do me a favor.
A favor, sir?

13:54.592 --> 13:55.938
I want you to pretend
you're Tom Willis,

13:56.076 --> 13:57.560
say your wife's got
a headache and go home.

13:57.698 --> 13:59.459
Mrs. Willis is ill?
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:59.597 --> 14:01.150
Not Mrs. Willis.
Florence!

14:01.288 --> 14:03.704
Florence?
Maybe she's been
working too hard.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.845
She ain't Florence,
she's Mrs. Willis.

14:05.983 --> 14:08.640
Oh. Maybe you've been
working too hard, sir.

14:09.710 --> 14:12.230
I told you to listen,
I don't have much time.

14:12.368 --> 14:13.887
There's a guy in there
that wants to meet
the Willises.

14:14.025 --> 14:15.337
They walked out on me.

14:15.475 --> 14:17.097
Now, I need them
to clinch a big deal.

14:17.235 --> 14:18.892
Florence has volunteered
to be Mrs. Willis

14:19.030 --> 14:20.135
and I want you
to be Mr. Willis.

14:20.273 --> 14:21.791
Oh,

14:21.930 --> 14:24.242
I don't know if I could
get away with being
Mr. Willis.

14:24.380 --> 14:25.692
It's easy! Just act dumb.

14:25.830 --> 14:28.384
Nobody will know
the difference.
Sir...

14:28.522 --> 14:30.628
Ralph, go downstairs,
put on your street suit
and come back.

14:30.766 --> 14:32.319
But, sir,
I'm on duty now.

14:32.457 --> 14:35.460
Too many people
depend on me for cabs,
packages, deliveries.

14:35.598 --> 14:37.359
No, I couldn't do it.

14:38.222 --> 14:39.430
There's 50 bucks
in it for you.

14:39.568 --> 14:41.294
I couldn't do it
for anybody
but you, sir.

14:41.950 --> 14:43.158
Thank you, Ralph.

14:48.197 --> 14:49.371
Get in the closet.
What?

14:49.509 --> 14:50.855
Get in the closet!

14:54.824 --> 14:59.105
Oh, you were right, George,
it's lovely out there.

15:00.485 --> 15:01.970
Yes. But it's cold.

15:02.108 --> 15:03.833
I could use a drink
to warm me up.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.353
Ah, what
will it be?

15:06.975 --> 15:08.079
Scotch
and water.

15:08.217 --> 15:09.218
Yeah, I'll have
the same.

15:09.356 --> 15:10.426
You got it.

15:10.564 --> 15:11.807
Just as soon as
you've seen our bedroom.

15:11.945 --> 15:12.946
The bedroom?

15:13.084 --> 15:14.154
Oh, yeah, the tour's
not completed

15:14.292 --> 15:15.776
till you've seen
our bedroom.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.433
Well, if that's the price
of a drink around here,

15:17.571 --> 15:19.228
let's go see
the bedroom.

15:19.366 --> 15:22.093
Oh, no. There's nothing
special about it.

15:22.231 --> 15:23.198
Nothing special!

15:23.336 --> 15:24.509
I love our bedroom so much

15:24.647 --> 15:26.615
I go in two or three
times a day just to look.

15:27.996 --> 15:29.169
Now,
George...

15:29.307 --> 15:31.137
My dear, don't
argue with that.

15:31.275 --> 15:33.070
If your husband loves
his bedroom that much,

15:33.208 --> 15:35.589
you must have
one hell of a marriage.

15:38.868 --> 15:41.630
Well, okay.
This way to the bedroom.

15:49.017 --> 15:50.708
Don't you ever push me
in no closet again!

15:50.846 --> 15:52.468
Shh!

15:52.606 --> 15:54.988
Do you know that
that light goes out
when you close that door?

15:57.957 --> 15:58.958
Come on, let's go.

15:59.096 --> 16:00.166
Where are we going?
Out.

16:00.304 --> 16:01.684
Uh-uh. That ain't
part of our deal.

16:01.822 --> 16:03.755
Look, you're going out
in the hallway for Ralph.

16:03.893 --> 16:05.274
For what?
Because he's your husband!

16:05.412 --> 16:06.793
Have you gone crazy?

16:06.931 --> 16:08.760
Look, he's playing
Tom Willis and you're
playing Helen Willis.

16:08.898 --> 16:10.314
Now get out there
and wait for him.

16:10.452 --> 16:12.937
Uh-uh. Let my husband
come down here
and wait for me.

16:13.075 --> 16:15.181
Florence,
would you come on!

16:15.319 --> 16:17.252
I ain't gonna stand
in this hall and look
like no dummy.

16:17.390 --> 16:19.081
You can't help
the way you look.

16:22.050 --> 16:24.742
Well, that's the end
of the tour,

16:24.880 --> 16:27.365
unless George wants you
to see the roof.

16:27.503 --> 16:31.438
Well, well, look who's here.
My dear friend Helen Willis.

16:38.445 --> 16:39.826
Very pleased
to meet you.

16:39.964 --> 16:42.277
I'm Jean Howard and
this is my husband Frank.

16:43.243 --> 16:44.796
I are charmed.

16:49.284 --> 16:50.285
George!

16:50.423 --> 16:51.493
I know what
you're gonna say, Weezy.

16:51.631 --> 16:54.151
"How come the drinks
ain't ready yet?"

16:54.289 --> 16:56.118
I'll explain it to you
later. Just play along.

16:56.256 --> 16:59.259
Make yourselves
comfortable, everybody.
Drinks are coming up.

16:59.984 --> 17:01.848
Good. I'll have
champagne.

17:01.986 --> 17:03.470
GEORGE: What?

17:03.608 --> 17:05.507
There's a bottle
in the refrigerator
on the second shelf.

17:13.722 --> 17:17.553
Champagne is the only thing
my husband and I ever drink.

17:17.691 --> 17:19.176
By the way,
where is your husband?

17:19.314 --> 17:20.487
Oh, he'll be down
in a minute.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.765
He had to go back upstairs
and change his suit.

17:23.835 --> 17:24.940
Why?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.253
It got wrinkled
coming down
in the elevator.

17:35.261 --> 17:37.228
And he's
so saditty.

17:42.406 --> 17:44.649
You finish making
the drinks, Weezy.
I'll get the door.

17:44.787 --> 17:46.720
Why don't you have
Florence get it?

17:46.858 --> 17:48.481
She went home while
you were in the kitchen.

17:48.619 --> 17:50.690
Why?
Look, her mother's very sick.

17:50.828 --> 17:52.347
Her mother is dead.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.074
Well, you can't get
no sicker than that.

17:57.421 --> 17:58.801
I got here as quick
as I could, sir.

17:58.939 --> 18:00.769
Oh, great,
come on in.

18:05.325 --> 18:09.985
Frank and Jean, this is
Tom Willis, my old buddy.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.538
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.

18:12.643 --> 18:15.197
And of course you remember
your wife, Helen.

18:15.335 --> 18:16.957
Oh, yes, of course.

18:17.648 --> 18:18.787
Hello, my darling.

18:30.937 --> 18:33.733
George, I would like to
talk to you in the kitchen.

18:33.871 --> 18:37.116
Not now, Weezy.
I'm sure my old buddy
Tom would like a drink.

18:37.254 --> 18:38.841
Yes, sir. I'll have
a Scotch and soda, sir.

18:38.979 --> 18:40.188
Sir!

18:41.603 --> 18:43.087
That's a little
private joke.

18:43.225 --> 18:44.951
Tom has such
a great sense of humor.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.540
Well, I guess
he needs it,

18:47.678 --> 18:49.887
like we did when
we first got married,

18:50.025 --> 18:51.613
fifteen years ago.

18:51.751 --> 18:53.718
Yeah. It feels
just like 20.

18:58.102 --> 18:59.414
How long have you two
been married?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.381
18 years.
25 years.

19:06.559 --> 19:07.663
Which is it?

19:08.354 --> 19:09.700
25 years.
18 years.

19:13.428 --> 19:15.154
Actually,
they're both right.

19:15.292 --> 19:16.914
You see, they were married
25 years ago

19:17.052 --> 19:18.743
and then after 18 years,
they had a second wedding.

19:18.881 --> 19:20.814
Like me and Weezy did.
Remember, Weez?

19:20.952 --> 19:23.300
Yeah. And I must have
been crazy to do it.

19:25.302 --> 19:28.719
No, no. I think
second weddings
are very romantic.

19:28.857 --> 19:30.997
I was talking about
the first one.

19:33.827 --> 19:35.450
Well, what do
you do, Willis?

19:35.588 --> 19:36.899
I'm a doorman.

19:39.143 --> 19:42.008
Doorman Publications.
He's a publisher.

19:42.146 --> 19:45.391
I've never heard of them.
What kind of books
do you publish?

19:45.529 --> 19:47.082
Books people read.

19:55.401 --> 19:56.954
That's the best kind.

20:00.716 --> 20:02.062
What are some
of your titles?

20:02.925 --> 20:04.513
We don't have
any titles.

20:04.651 --> 20:06.274
Just call me
"Mister."

20:08.241 --> 20:09.656
He means book titles.

20:09.794 --> 20:13.073
Oh! Titl...
Of course we give
all our books titles.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.317
Otherwise people wouldn't
know what to ask for

20:15.455 --> 20:17.699
when they went
to buy them, would they?

20:21.668 --> 20:24.050
I remember when
Frank and I first
started out in business.

20:24.188 --> 20:26.466
Whew, the opposition
we met.

20:26.604 --> 20:28.951
Has your marriage caused
any problems
with your company?

20:29.089 --> 20:31.195
No, I've never had
any marriage problems.

20:32.472 --> 20:33.991
From the look
on your wife's face,

20:34.129 --> 20:37.650
I don't think she
quite agrees with that.

20:37.788 --> 20:39.445
What are you
thinking, Helen?

20:39.583 --> 20:42.241
I'm thinking how come
I ain't had none of
that champagne yet.

20:43.932 --> 20:46.555
Are you sure you want
a drink, Helen, dear?

20:46.693 --> 20:48.488
I'm positive,
honey.

20:53.631 --> 20:55.426
But you know it's bad
for your headache.

20:55.564 --> 20:56.876
I don't have
a headache.

20:57.014 --> 20:59.188
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.

21:00.431 --> 21:02.916
I'll have another
Scotch and soda,
old buddy.

21:06.748 --> 21:09.716
The Jeffersons are always
so "hospi-table."

21:14.721 --> 21:17.655
Oh, hi, everybody.

21:17.793 --> 21:18.794
Hi, Lionel.

21:18.932 --> 21:20.279
You remember Frank Howard?
Oh, yeah, hi.

21:20.417 --> 21:22.039
His wife, Jean.
How do you do?

21:22.177 --> 21:23.765
Hey, Flore...
You don't have time
to talk to your in-laws.

21:23.903 --> 21:25.214
Jenny called.
What?

21:25.353 --> 21:26.492
Jenny called
and dinner's ready.

21:26.630 --> 21:28.148
But, Pop,
why is Florence...

21:28.287 --> 21:29.667
Shame on you, Lionel,
keeping your wife
waiting like that.

21:29.805 --> 21:30.979
But, Pop...

21:33.084 --> 21:34.569
Oh, my goodness.

21:34.707 --> 21:36.467
I'm just training him
to be a good son-in-law.

21:36.605 --> 21:38.055
Your Jenny
deserves the best.

21:38.193 --> 21:39.815
Thank you,
Georgie, dear.

21:40.713 --> 21:42.059
Okay, now,
where were we?

21:42.197 --> 21:45.096
In the middle of
making your good friend
Tom a drink.

21:45.234 --> 21:49.204
Oh, yeah. Then you can
all join me in a toast.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.861
To what?

21:50.999 --> 21:52.345
To the big deal
me and Frank are gonna
make. Right, Frank?

21:52.483 --> 21:54.140
Right, George.
We got a deal.

21:54.278 --> 21:55.417
Great!

21:56.349 --> 21:59.145
But I still doesn't
have no champagne.

22:06.428 --> 22:08.465
Coming right up,
Helen, dear.
You deserve it.

22:12.296 --> 22:13.677
Doorbell, Louise.

22:25.309 --> 22:26.793
Thank you, Helen.

22:27.829 --> 22:29.796
Remind me to
talk to you tomorrow

22:29.934 --> 22:31.695
about hiring a new maid.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.561
Hello, Louise.

22:40.428 --> 22:42.637
Oh, what are you two
doing back?

22:42.775 --> 22:43.983
We just bumped
into Lionel.

22:44.121 --> 22:46.365
Here's the champagne.
Wrong year.

23:02.622 --> 23:04.141
George, I think
you ought to

23:04.279 --> 23:06.454
have the pleasure
of making the introductions.

23:06.592 --> 23:08.283
Oh, ah...

23:08.421 --> 23:10.768
Oh, you must be
Mr. and Mrs. Howard.

23:10.906 --> 23:11.942
That's right.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.564
I'm Florence Johnston,

23:13.702 --> 23:14.979
the Jeffersons' maid.

23:17.568 --> 23:18.776
You are?

23:18.914 --> 23:21.089
Oh, yes,
she sure is.

23:21.227 --> 23:23.194
And I'm Ralph.
I work in the building.

23:25.058 --> 23:27.475
And I don't know who I am.

23:30.892 --> 23:34.654
I just stopped by to see
if you needed any help
throwing that big party.

23:34.792 --> 23:35.862
What big party?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.070
The big bash
you're throwing

23:37.208 --> 23:39.728
for the Willises' anniversary
next week.

23:39.866 --> 23:42.179
I ain't throwing no party
for no Willises' anniversary.

23:42.317 --> 23:45.389
Really? And after all
they've just done for you?

23:45.527 --> 23:48.357
And you don't want them
to stop, do you?

23:53.501 --> 23:55.123
Well, maybe just
a little party.

23:56.365 --> 23:58.471
Oh, I'm sorry,
Mrs. Willis,

23:58.609 --> 24:00.784
I hope we didn't
spoil the surprise.

24:00.922 --> 24:03.442
Ain't nothing gonna
surprise me after tonight.

24:05.754 --> 24:08.585
But what a very nice thing
to do for your friends'
anniversary.

24:08.723 --> 24:10.414
Oh, George is like that.

24:10.552 --> 24:12.899
And he was just kidding
about the little party.

24:13.037 --> 24:15.833
When George does something,
he goes all the way.

24:15.971 --> 24:17.904
Don't you, George?
Yep.

24:18.042 --> 24:20.597
He's renting
a private dining room.
I am?

24:20.735 --> 24:22.288
And hiring
an orchestra, right?

24:22.426 --> 24:24.290
And he's inviting
all the Willises' friends.

24:24.428 --> 24:25.429
All of them?

24:25.567 --> 24:28.052
Weezy.
And the best caterer in town.

24:28.190 --> 24:30.745
And a lot of champagne.
And caviar!

24:50.489 --> 24:52.180
ANNOUNCER:
The Jeffersons
was videotaped

24:52.318 --> 24:54.320
in front of
a studio audience.
