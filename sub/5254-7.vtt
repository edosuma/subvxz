Previously on "Faking It"...

00:01.621 --> 00:02.606
Shrimp girl?

00:02.626 --> 00:04.033
I feel lucky every day I'm with you.

00:04.053 --> 00:05.689
I feel like I'm the lucky one.

00:05.692 --> 00:07.643
I'm not out yet,
so I have to keep things discrete.

00:07.663 --> 00:09.101
- Right.
- Can I get your number?

00:09.121 --> 00:10.628
I think we should go out.

00:10.630 --> 00:12.697
You can't kiss me the way that
you did and then mix signals.

00:12.699 --> 00:14.465
Why can't you admit that you like me?

00:14.467 --> 00:16.334
Fine. I like you.

00:16.335 --> 00:19.544
- I kind of met someone.
- Tell me everything.

00:20.739 --> 00:23.092
I feel like I haven't seen you in 20 years.

00:23.112 --> 00:24.519
Can we do a girls' night on Saturday?

00:24.539 --> 00:25.609
I can't.

00:25.611 --> 00:27.244
Reagan and I are going to communal,

00:27.246 --> 00:29.412
that super trendy new restaurant
where you share everything.

00:29.414 --> 00:31.048
But you hate sharing.

00:31.050 --> 00:33.617
I know,
and yet I'm weirdly looking forward to it.

00:33.619 --> 00:36.987
'Cause you're going with Reagan,
your new girlfriend.

00:36.989 --> 00:39.122
Shut up. She's not my girlfriend.

00:39.124 --> 00:40.390
Right.

00:40.392 --> 00:42.726
Well, when do I get to
meet this non-girlfriend?

00:42.728 --> 00:45.962
Ooh, let's make communal a double date.

00:45.964 --> 00:48.398
As fun as that sounds, it's...
it's only been two weeks.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.734
We're not at that stage of
meeting the friends yet,

00:50.754 --> 00:52.902
and it's...
it's definitely too soon for a double date.

00:52.904 --> 00:55.004
Okay, I get it. I just miss you.

00:55.006 --> 00:57.680
Can we do dinner tonight?

00:57.700 --> 00:59.175
Let me guess, plans with Reagan?

00:59.177 --> 01:02.011
- We're going bowling, I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry for me.

01:02.013 --> 01:04.313
You're the one who has
to wear rented shoes.

01:04.315 --> 01:07.116
But you've at least told her
all about me, right?

01:07.118 --> 01:09.351
Are you serious?
I've told her tons about you.

01:09.353 --> 01:11.752
I'm always like, "Karma this, Karma that."

01:11.772 --> 01:14.690
She can't wait to meet you, and she will

01:14.692 --> 01:17.434
as soon as I decide I really like her.

01:21.557 --> 01:24.659
- I really like you.
- I really like you too.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.464
Shh. I don't think my mom heard us.

01:31.484 --> 01:33.574
Would it be so terrible if she did?

01:33.576 --> 01:35.177
Uh, she would put bars on the windows,

01:35.179 --> 01:37.045
no more sneaking in.

01:37.047 --> 01:39.747
Well, we can't have that, can we?

01:46.119 --> 01:47.223
Uh...

01:47.757 --> 01:49.957
- To be continued.
- Okay.

01:52.077 --> 01:53.944
My friends can't stop texting me,

01:53.964 --> 01:56.197
saying how much they
loved meeting you tonight

01:56.199 --> 01:58.841
and not just because you're
a shockingly good bowler.

01:58.861 --> 02:01.509
I won't lie,
I have thought about getting my own ball.

02:01.529 --> 02:03.892
Do it. But you set the bar too high.

02:03.912 --> 02:08.542
When I meet your friends,
I'm really gonna have to bring my a-game.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.704
You do have friends, right?

02:10.723 --> 02:13.161
You haven't mentioned any.
Did you kill them all?

02:13.181 --> 02:16.150
Just want to ask that up front.

02:16.152 --> 02:17.517
Of course I have friends.

02:17.519 --> 02:19.553
They're... busy studying.

02:19.555 --> 02:20.787
Midterms.

02:20.789 --> 02:25.567
Besides, I want you all to myself.

Uncle! Uncle, Uncle.

02:45.046 --> 02:47.328
Role play, I like it.

02:47.348 --> 02:50.015
Okay, "a," if you knew my Uncle,

02:50.017 --> 02:51.283
you'd know that's gross.

02:51.285 --> 02:53.652
And, "b," I gotta run.

02:53.654 --> 02:55.153
I have meditation first period,

02:55.155 --> 02:57.723
and my teacher's a real
bitch if you're late.

02:57.725 --> 02:59.091
Can't you just skip class?

02:59.093 --> 03:01.259
Tempting, but I need the sunlight.

03:01.261 --> 03:03.195
I've spent so much time in your closet,

03:03.197 --> 03:06.364
my vitamin D levels are dangerously low.

03:06.366 --> 03:08.233
Look, Shane, I really like you, but...

03:08.235 --> 03:11.736
We can't be seen together in public,
I know.

03:11.738 --> 03:13.638
I really like you too.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.476
I just wish we could spend time
together out in the real world.

03:17.478 --> 03:19.384
I want to introduce you to my friends.

03:19.404 --> 03:21.246
And I want to meet them too,

03:21.248 --> 03:25.583
but I can't risk anyone knowing I'm gay.

03:25.585 --> 03:27.284
What if we have a group hang?

03:27.286 --> 03:30.054
We'll tell everyone you're my trainer.
They won't suspect a thing.

03:30.056 --> 03:32.056
I don't know. That sounds risky.

03:32.058 --> 03:34.525
So risky, it'll be hot.

03:34.527 --> 03:36.393
Yeah, we'll have to sneak off
to the bathroom

03:36.395 --> 03:38.896
for a quick training sesh. Hmm?

03:38.898 --> 03:41.932
- Let's do it.
- Yeah?

03:45.069 --> 03:46.537
I'll set it up for Saturday night.

03:46.539 --> 03:49.340
Please hang out with me and
my trainer Saturday, please?

03:49.342 --> 03:51.708
Why do you want me to hang out
with your trainer so badly?

03:51.710 --> 03:54.311
Because if we all hang out
and he sees how cool you are,

03:54.313 --> 03:57.070
he might train me in front
of other people more often.

03:57.090 --> 03:59.241
You're not trying to drag him
out of the closet, are you?

03:59.261 --> 04:01.551
No, I don't do that anymore.

04:01.553 --> 04:04.387
But if my trainer just
pops out once he has dinner

04:04.389 --> 04:07.323
with my cool, open-minded friends,
would that be so terrible?

04:07.325 --> 04:09.960
Even if I did support this,
I can't do Saturday.

04:09.962 --> 04:12.422
Amy has a date with Reagan,
so I have a date with Karma.

04:13.058 --> 04:14.497
Can't we smush all these dates together?

04:14.499 --> 04:16.232
I promised Duke a group hang.

04:16.252 --> 04:18.767
As fun as that sounds,
apparently Reagan is off-limits.

04:18.769 --> 04:21.290
- Karma hasn't even met her.
- Hey, guys.

04:21.310 --> 04:24.641
- You haven't met Reagan yet?
- Amy says it's too soon.

04:24.643 --> 04:26.942
She's asked me to give her
space in her dating life,

04:26.944 --> 04:28.978
and I'm totally fine with it.

04:28.980 --> 04:30.490
Really?

04:30.782 --> 04:32.948
Well, sure, the longer I don't meet Reagan,

04:32.950 --> 04:36.385
the more I worry she's
gonna harvest Amy's organs.

04:36.521 --> 04:38.487
But I'm mostly sure she isn't.

04:38.668 --> 04:41.952
So I'm just gonna give Amy space
until she's ready to introduce us.

04:41.972 --> 04:43.492
All right, I gotta run to the studio.

04:43.494 --> 04:45.094
Let me know where you
wanna go on Saturday, okay?

04:45.096 --> 04:47.229
Okay.

04:49.299 --> 04:50.765
Have to say, not so sure

04:50.767 --> 04:53.908
if this whole "giving Amy space"
plan is the right move.

04:54.238 --> 04:55.012
What do you mean?

04:55.032 --> 04:57.406
I mean that while you're
off giving her space,

04:57.408 --> 04:59.374
Reagan could be burrowing herself deeper

04:59.376 --> 05:00.975
into Amy's love nest.

05:00.977 --> 05:05.413
Lesbians move fast,
and they are viciously territorial.

05:05.415 --> 05:08.282
Amy would never date anyone like that.

05:08.284 --> 05:10.439
Are you messing with me?

05:10.459 --> 05:13.256
Fine, if you think being a
former fake lesbian makes you

05:13.276 --> 05:17.391
an expert on the gay community,
go ahead, take your chances.

05:17.632 --> 05:21.462
Or you could coincidentally
show up on their date Saturday

05:21.464 --> 05:23.965
and show Reagan that when it comes to Amy,

05:23.985 --> 05:26.701
you are the free gift with purchase.

05:28.238 --> 05:29.670
I don't know.

05:29.974 --> 05:32.607
Amy says it's too soon for double dates.

05:32.754 --> 05:34.074
I tell you what.

05:34.076 --> 05:36.710
My trainer and I will come along too.
Then it's a group hang.

05:36.712 --> 05:40.080
Amy didn't say anything
about group hangs, did she?

05:40.082 --> 05:42.263
Technically, no.

05:42.952 --> 05:44.351
I'm trying. I'm trying.

05:44.353 --> 05:46.880
I need more time. I gotta go.

05:48.257 --> 05:49.723
Lauren, hi.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.158
What are we doing?

05:51.160 --> 05:52.292
Excuse me?

05:52.294 --> 05:53.386
We kissed.

05:53.406 --> 05:55.762
Then you rescued me from my
accidental ecstasy overdose.

05:55.764 --> 05:57.397
Now we have lunch semi-regularly,

05:57.399 --> 05:59.432
and you send me texts with playful emojis.

05:59.434 --> 06:01.301
What are we doing?

06:01.303 --> 06:04.804
- Um, I... well, I...
- Today, please.

06:04.806 --> 06:06.406
Look, I like you, Lauren,

06:06.408 --> 06:08.742
but I'm not looking for anything serious.

06:08.744 --> 06:11.494
Well, who said I'm looking
for anything serious?

06:11.514 --> 06:12.845
Especially with you.

06:12.847 --> 06:14.747
I don't even know if
you're boyfriend material.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.816
So to figure that out,
you're taking me to dinner Saturday

06:16.818 --> 06:20.952
to someplace nice.
You lose points if it's a chain restaurant.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.657
Namaste. Welcome to Communal.

06:24.659 --> 06:27.192
Here's this evening's prix fixe menu.

06:27.194 --> 06:29.027
All dishes are communal,
just like your table.

06:29.029 --> 06:30.296
So how does this work?

06:30.298 --> 06:32.864
You bring me a dish,
and I eat it all myself?

06:32.866 --> 06:34.266
No, here at Communal,

06:34.268 --> 06:36.001
we encourage a communal dining experience.

06:36.003 --> 06:37.803
Oh. Okay.

06:37.805 --> 06:40.850
So we get this table all to ourselves?

06:40.870 --> 06:43.456
No, it's communal dining. Communal?

06:43.476 --> 06:44.990
What is this place called again?

06:47.615 --> 06:48.847
Oh, this is great.

06:48.849 --> 06:50.682
Food and making fun of people
are my favorite things.

06:50.684 --> 06:53.685
Hey, hey, hey. What is up?

06:53.687 --> 06:55.821
Shane, what are you doing here?

06:55.823 --> 06:58.656
Just a night out with Duke,
my personal trainer.

06:58.658 --> 07:00.891
Funny, I almost brought my dentist.

07:00.893 --> 07:03.093
Shane and I usually just
hang out at the gym,

07:03.095 --> 07:04.796
you know, as trainer and client.

07:04.798 --> 07:07.532
But he invited me to this group hang.

07:07.534 --> 07:10.401
- Group hang?
- Oh, my God, Amy.

07:10.403 --> 07:13.731
- What a coincidence.
- Let me guess.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.672
- Group hang?
- So fun.

07:15.674 --> 07:18.832
I was just telling Amy I
wanted to meet her friends.

07:18.852 --> 07:19.676
You were?

07:19.678 --> 07:21.378
She did the whole meet
and greet with my friends.

07:21.380 --> 07:23.280
Seems only fair.

07:23.282 --> 07:25.216
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

07:25.218 --> 07:26.551
Oh. I'm Karma.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.760
Nice to meet you, Carmen.

07:30.289 --> 07:33.984
Karma. Karma.

07:34.004 --> 07:36.647
Here you are, last two seats in the house.

07:39.630 --> 07:43.433
You get an "a" for location and an
"f" for clientele.

07:50.099 --> 07:53.156
Amy? Can I see you in the bathroom?

07:55.571 --> 07:57.672
I don't really need to go.

08:06.982 --> 08:09.216
Amy, she has no idea who I am.
I feel like an idiot.

08:09.218 --> 08:10.585
You weren't supposed to be here.

08:10.587 --> 08:11.895
You were supposed to give me space.

08:11.915 --> 08:13.588
You lied to me.

08:13.590 --> 08:14.855
She has no clue I exist.

08:14.857 --> 08:16.424
I didn't know how to tell her.

08:16.426 --> 08:18.293
We're best friends, we're insanely close,

08:18.295 --> 08:21.195
and, oh, yeah, oh, I was in love with you.

08:21.197 --> 08:22.930
Was?

08:23.392 --> 08:26.200
I-it's great we're getting past that.

08:26.202 --> 08:28.568
I know, and it's because of Reagan.

08:28.570 --> 08:31.538
I really like her,
and I didn't want to scare her away.

08:31.540 --> 08:34.140
I was gonna tell her eventually,

08:34.143 --> 08:37.198
like around when we would
get a joint checking account.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.578
We've always said our
friendship comes first.

08:39.581 --> 08:41.424
Can we start over?

08:41.549 --> 08:43.993
I think you two would
really like each other.

08:44.013 --> 08:48.322
If you really like her,
I'm sure I'll like her too.

08:49.511 --> 08:50.924
Where do I know you from?

08:50.926 --> 08:52.492
Yeah, I know, I was thinking that as well.

08:52.494 --> 08:54.294
Do you go to Hester?

08:54.296 --> 08:56.629
No. Do you go to lesbian karaoke?

08:56.631 --> 08:58.031
That's a thing?

08:58.033 --> 08:59.365
It's like normal karaoke,

08:59.367 --> 09:01.567
only everyone sings pink.

09:01.569 --> 09:02.635
Hmm. Prix fixe menu.

09:02.637 --> 09:04.003
Perfect.

09:04.005 --> 09:06.072
I'm giving you a b-plus.

09:06.074 --> 09:08.341
This is at least an a-minus menu.

09:08.343 --> 09:09.742
Not that I care,

09:09.744 --> 09:10.743
because I'm not trying
to be your boyfriend.

09:10.745 --> 09:12.311
Time for the questions round.

09:12.313 --> 09:13.779
Please answer the following questions

09:13.781 --> 09:14.980
about your family's medical history.

09:14.982 --> 09:17.350
- Any heart disease?
- No.

09:17.352 --> 09:18.451
High blood pressure?

09:18.453 --> 09:20.285
Now, when they bring out the dishes,

09:20.287 --> 09:23.322
start with the leans and greens
to achieve your fitness goals.

09:23.324 --> 09:26.332
Isn't this a fun group hang?
Aren't my friends great?

09:26.352 --> 09:27.860
Yeah, they seem really nice.

09:27.862 --> 09:31.730
They are nice and
open-minded and accepting.

09:31.750 --> 09:34.721
You want me to come out to your friends.
That's why we're here, isn't it?

09:34.741 --> 09:36.068
Don't be ridiculous.

09:36.070 --> 09:38.534
I'm your trainer tonight. That's it.

09:38.554 --> 09:40.202
Stop picking at that bread.

09:40.222 --> 09:42.374
Now I remember. That's it!

09:42.376 --> 09:46.745
You're son of Skwerkel.
I catered that engagement party!

09:47.051 --> 09:49.447
Uh... Hey!

09:49.449 --> 09:52.149
- Hey, Karma's back.
- I'm back.

09:52.151 --> 09:54.713
And, Reagan,
I'm so excited to get to know you.

09:54.733 --> 09:57.355
- Tell me everything.
- Maybe not everything.

09:57.357 --> 09:59.723
It's so funny.
I just realized I met Liam...

09:59.725 --> 10:02.360
Oh, at this table!

10:02.362 --> 10:05.396
Uh, yeah, yes. Great times.

10:05.398 --> 10:07.365
I can't wait for more.

10:07.367 --> 10:09.880
- No, Amy. Remember the party?
- What party?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.569
Uh, Reagan mentioned
she was from San Antonio.

10:12.571 --> 10:15.551
Uh, Karma and I went on a
field trip to San Antonio

10:15.571 --> 10:16.668
in fourth grade.

10:16.688 --> 10:18.308
I don't think Reagan
wants to hear about that.

10:18.310 --> 10:20.206
Oh, but we had such a good time
in San Antonio.

10:20.226 --> 10:22.446
Remember? Remember the Alamo?

10:22.448 --> 10:24.615
I'm guessing you went to the Alamo.

10:24.617 --> 10:26.082
Uh, no. Seaworld.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.118
Yeah, but the bus forgot Sam Alamo.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.120
Which taught us an important lesson.

10:30.122 --> 10:31.922
Remember the Alamo.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.826
It seems like you guys go pretty far back.

10:36.828 --> 10:39.930
Can't believe you never mentioned her once,
Shrimp girl.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.032
Um, that's... that's my nickname.

10:42.034 --> 10:44.801
She calls me that because I-I love shrimp.

10:44.803 --> 10:47.003
Yeah. I know you love shrimp.

10:47.005 --> 10:49.371
And we do go back. Way, way back.

10:49.373 --> 10:50.573
To kindergarten.

10:50.575 --> 10:52.374
If you thought that Sam
Alamo story was good,

10:52.376 --> 10:55.311
you should hear about the time
we dyed our hair with kool-aid.

10:55.908 --> 10:57.943
My mother couldn't handle raising me alone,

10:57.963 --> 11:00.416
so she left me on the steps
of her church in a basket

11:00.418 --> 11:01.751
with a note

11:01.753 --> 11:04.687
"Please take care of my baby boy."

11:04.689 --> 11:06.822
And that's how I became

11:06.824 --> 11:08.857
- the son of a preacher man.
- Really?

11:08.859 --> 11:10.826
No, not really.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.395
You are not taking this seriously.

11:13.397 --> 11:15.164
You're not respecting my boundaries.

11:15.166 --> 11:17.799
Everyone,
it's time for the communal experience.

11:17.801 --> 11:19.935
Now, when deciding what to eat,
I want you to think lean...

11:19.937 --> 11:22.737
- And green. Yeah, I know.
- That's adorable.

11:22.739 --> 11:24.639
My ex and I used to finish
each other's sentences.

11:24.641 --> 11:27.375
Oh, we're not together. I'm his trainer.

11:27.910 --> 11:30.211
Yep, I'm just working on my fitness.

11:30.213 --> 11:33.014
What do you think, Victor?
Is he good at his job?

11:33.016 --> 11:34.850
I think he's quite skilled.

11:34.852 --> 11:35.851
What?

11:35.853 --> 11:38.115
If this is just business,
we can flirt with whoever we want, right?

11:38.135 --> 11:41.589
We sure can. Excuse me, I'm sorry.

11:41.591 --> 11:43.869
I heard what's going on here,
and I just wanted to say,

11:43.889 --> 11:45.805
if I were lucky enough
to be on a date with you,

11:45.825 --> 11:47.895
I would tell you anything
you wanted to know.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.031
Why, thank you.

11:50.033 --> 11:52.800
It's so nice to finally be appreciated,

11:52.802 --> 11:56.470
especially by someone so... rugged.

11:56.472 --> 12:01.141
And then it took three years to grow back.

12:01.143 --> 12:03.110
I'm sorry. I've been hogging the mic.

12:03.112 --> 12:05.345
Reagan, tell me how you two met.

12:05.347 --> 12:07.748
- Well, Amy and I...
- Um, Karma, look.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.985
- Mushrooms!
- Let me guess.

12:10.987 --> 12:13.086
You guys have some special
thing about mushrooms.

12:13.088 --> 12:15.289
Not exactly a special thing, but it's just,

12:15.309 --> 12:17.969
I hate mushrooms, and Amy loves them.

12:17.989 --> 12:20.427
Why don't you try some of this kale, Amy?

12:20.429 --> 12:22.195
Oh, no. Amy hates kale.

12:22.197 --> 12:24.398
Luckily, she has all these mushrooms.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.033
It's funny.

12:26.035 --> 12:28.300
Amy's never mentioned mushrooms before,

12:28.302 --> 12:30.492
so how much could she really love them?

12:31.806 --> 12:34.507
Trust me. Amy loves mushrooms.

12:34.509 --> 12:37.443
- Kale could never compare.
- Experiment with both.

12:37.445 --> 12:40.312
I just think everyone should
eat what's in front of them

12:40.314 --> 12:42.515
and not share anything. He's right.

12:42.517 --> 12:44.575
Everyone should leave other
people's dishes alone.

12:44.595 --> 12:46.212
There's nothing wrong
with changing your mind

12:46.232 --> 12:47.653
once you've already ordered.

12:47.655 --> 12:51.390
We should all try the kale.
It's full of antioxidants.

12:57.830 --> 12:59.663
Yum.

13:00.060 --> 13:01.800
Mmm, so good.

13:02.009 --> 13:04.937
I'm glad I tried this.
I knew you'd like it.

13:04.939 --> 13:07.405
- Kale's a fad food.
- Uh, excuse me?

13:07.407 --> 13:10.492
I can't hear you over all the kale chewing.

13:19.318 --> 13:22.053
This must have been cooked in peanut oil,
and Amy's allergic.

13:22.055 --> 13:23.521
Oh, God. I had no idea!

13:23.523 --> 13:25.256
- I'll call 911.
- I don't think she can breathe.

13:25.258 --> 13:28.093
- Oh, I bet Duke can handle this.
- I can handle it.

13:31.377 --> 13:34.398
There. All better.

13:36.668 --> 13:39.336
Do you want some mushrooms?

13:41.442 --> 13:43.172
Reagan, where are you going?

13:43.407 --> 13:44.392
Where am I going?

13:44.412 --> 13:47.817
Amy, yesterday I had no idea
you had any friends at all.

13:47.837 --> 13:50.843
But apparently,
you have this best friend, Karma,

13:50.863 --> 13:52.300
who you share tons of history with

13:52.320 --> 13:54.032
and who carries your epipen!

13:54.052 --> 13:56.255
So to answer your question, I'm going home.

13:56.257 --> 13:57.656
I'm sorry. I didn't know how to tell you.

13:57.658 --> 13:59.391
There's no need to get territorial.

13:59.393 --> 14:02.628
- Amy can have a best friend.
- I'm territorial?

14:02.630 --> 14:04.329
I'm surprised you haven't peed on her yet.

14:04.331 --> 14:06.965
You act more like a jealous
ex than a best friend.

14:06.967 --> 14:09.435
Well, she kind of is.

14:09.437 --> 14:11.069
Did you not tell her? W...

14:11.071 --> 14:13.604
I cannot keep track of
who knows what anymore.

14:13.606 --> 14:15.006
You two were a couple?

14:15.008 --> 14:17.675
No! Sort of.

14:17.677 --> 14:20.078
We were faking being
lesbians to be popular.

14:20.080 --> 14:23.148
- Good save.
- You were a fake lesbian?

14:23.150 --> 14:25.016
No, no, no. Karma was faking it.

14:25.018 --> 14:27.085
I-I, um...

14:30.121 --> 14:32.093
You're in love with her.

14:33.460 --> 14:36.260
That's it. I'm leaving.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.959
It's okay.

14:42.979 --> 14:44.635
If she can't handle our relationship,

14:44.637 --> 14:47.404
then maybe it's not meant to be.

14:47.406 --> 14:49.814
Do you want some dessert?
They have homemade doughnuts.

14:49.834 --> 14:52.843
She doesn't want doughnuts.
She wants Reagan.

14:52.845 --> 14:54.824
- Amy loves doughnuts.
- Karma, we get it.

14:54.844 --> 14:56.288
You know all of Amy's favorite foods,

14:56.308 --> 14:59.016
but can't you see that
she's really into Reagan?

14:59.018 --> 15:00.985
You can fix this,
but you've gotta go and stop her.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.453
You're right.

15:02.762 --> 15:04.855
No, Karma. Karma, this isn't about you.

15:04.857 --> 15:08.197
- You need to give them space.
- You don't understand.

15:10.194 --> 15:11.714
Check, please.

15:11.734 --> 15:14.865
Butterscotch budino,
on the house.

15:14.867 --> 15:17.118
Well, that's so nice of you.

15:17.138 --> 15:20.003
I'm gonna have to give you a big tip.

15:20.749 --> 15:24.673
- You want to get out of here?
- I thought you'd never ask.

15:24.914 --> 15:26.075
No way.

15:26.077 --> 15:28.711
I brought her here.
I'm taking her home.

15:28.713 --> 15:30.679
You know I'm a black belt
in four martial arts, right?

15:30.681 --> 15:33.961
I'm a black belt too, in ass whupping.

15:33.981 --> 15:36.318
Aw! You passed the test.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.420
- You can totally be my boyfriend.
- What about Duke?

15:38.422 --> 15:41.523
Oh, he's obviously gay
and on a date with Shane.

15:45.614 --> 15:49.164

- Mm, it's what I do.

15:55.104 --> 15:57.240
Group hang, awesome.

16:01.632 --> 16:04.612
- Reagan, don't go.
- Sorry, Shrimp girl.

Life's too short to chase someone
who's chasing someone else.

16:07.365 --> 16:10.184
I'm not in love with Karma anymore.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.346
Then why didn't you tell me about her?

16:12.366 --> 16:15.528
And why did you freak out when
I tried to tell her about us?

16:15.548 --> 16:18.861
I'm sorry, I can't do this if Karma's gonna
be lingering in the background.
