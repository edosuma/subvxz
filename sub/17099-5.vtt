01:37.396 --> 01:40.462
New automobile, bespoke suit;

01:41.033 --> 01:43.517
our victim was a man of means, Julia.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.117
So what was he doing
in this part of town?

01:46.237 --> 01:47.550
I don't know.

01:47.670 --> 01:49.094
How long has he been dead?

01:49.879 --> 01:52.828
Well, rigor has passed, so
more than a day I'd hazard.

01:52.867 --> 01:56.397
And the vomit on his jacket
is quite dry. William,

01:56.845 --> 01:59.694
there's intra-dermal
bruising on his right temple,

01:59.943 --> 02:02.742
so he was leaning heavily
on it before he died.

02:03.434 --> 02:04.823
The right temple?

02:05.294 --> 02:08.370
That seems odd, given that
he's in the driver's seat.

02:10.428 --> 02:12.282
Julia,

02:12.288 --> 02:15.895
I don't think our victim
came here voluntarily.

02:16.602 --> 02:19.868
I believe someone may
have driven him here.

02:20.339 --> 02:22.629
Moved his body into the driver's seat.

02:25.263 --> 02:27.953
He died 36 to 48 hours ago,

02:27.975 --> 02:29.496
perhaps longer.

02:29.616 --> 02:32.794
Vehicle was registered
to an Edward Mclnnes,

02:32.816 --> 02:34.748
owner of Mclnnes Biscuits.

02:34.770 --> 02:37.099
His wife reported him
missing two days ago.

02:37.564 --> 02:40.419
- Do we have a cause of death yet?
- We're going to test for poisons.

02:40.425 --> 02:43.191
Miss James is bottling
Mr. Mclnnes in readiness.

02:43.311 --> 02:44.824
Oh, I see.

02:44.890 --> 02:46.324
Don't worry, Detective,

02:46.622 --> 02:48.990
we will try to put everything
back in the right place.

02:49.699 --> 02:51.972
I'm sure his wife will appreciate that.

02:52.780 --> 02:54.950
I'll wager you're eager to get started.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.395
I won't keep you ladies. Good day.

03:00.782 --> 03:03.570
- Did I upset the Detective?
- Not at all.

03:03.598 --> 03:05.502
He never did get the
hang of morgue humour.

03:05.535 --> 03:08.606
You, on the other
hand, are a quick study.

03:08.783 --> 03:10.465
What do we have here?

03:13.021 --> 03:14.349
A young woman

03:14.532 --> 03:16.740
fished out of the river
early this morning.

03:19.683 --> 03:20.928
Oh no!

03:20.950 --> 03:23.163
- What is it, Miss James?
- No, it can't be!

03:23.788 --> 03:25.177
You know her?

03:25.565 --> 03:26.749
It's Sarah.

03:27.175 --> 03:28.835
Sarah Franklin.

03:29.704 --> 03:32.071
She's at the Medical
College, two years above me.

03:32.802 --> 03:34.080
I'm so sorry.

03:34.638 --> 03:36.409
Dear God, how could this happen?

03:43.573 --> 03:45.194
Are you sure, Doctor?

03:45.914 --> 03:48.469
I can't find any evidence of wrongdoing.

03:49.222 --> 03:51.402
I'm going to record a death by drowning,

03:51.606 --> 03:53.969
but I believe Miss
Franklin took her own life.

03:55.197 --> 03:56.807
That's not possible.

03:58.522 --> 04:00.401
I realize it's not
what you want to hear,

04:00.436 --> 04:02.572
but it is consistent
with the police report.

04:03.657 --> 04:05.787
Her shawl was folded nearby,

04:05.808 --> 04:07.675
there were stones in her pocket,

04:07.896 --> 04:10.369
and railing on the
footbridge wasn't broken.

04:10.795 --> 04:14.314
It seems she climbed over and
threw herself into the water.

04:14.967 --> 04:16.651
Or she was thrown over.

04:16.892 --> 04:18.713
There was no evidence of struggle.

04:18.940 --> 04:22.257
But Sarah had no reason to
take her own life, Dr. Ogden.

04:22.725 --> 04:24.512
She was about to graduate,

04:24.551 --> 04:26.858
she just received a
research scholarship.

04:27.157 --> 04:29.299
She was so excited about her future.

04:30.593 --> 04:32.247
There was no water in her stomach;

04:32.367 --> 04:33.968
how can you explain that?

04:34.770 --> 04:35.938
It could have been forced

04:35.971 --> 04:37.791
into the intestines by peristalsis,

04:37.825 --> 04:40.742
especially if she had an empty
stomach and drowned slowly.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.267
Miss James,

04:45.759 --> 04:47.615
this must be a terrible shock.

04:48.476 --> 04:50.174
I'm so sorry.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.793
Yes, my husband was wearing this suit

05:01.826 --> 05:04.332
- when he left the house.
- Tuesday evening?

05:04.510 --> 05:06.367
It was the last time I saw him.

05:08.370 --> 05:11.906
Had your husband encountered
any problems of late?

05:11.941 --> 05:13.908
- At work perhaps?
- No.

05:14.028 --> 05:16.744
Edward was an astute business
man and very well-liked.

05:16.779 --> 05:19.112
He has never been anything
but a good provider.

05:21.956 --> 05:24.789
Mrs. Mclnnes, if I may ask...

05:24.861 --> 05:27.572
Edward and I were betrothed
at a very young age.

05:27.692 --> 05:30.377
We raised our children
in a Christian household.

05:30.759 --> 05:32.860
We were always courteous to one another,

05:32.895 --> 05:34.996
but our marriage was no love match.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.519
I see.

05:36.639 --> 05:39.414
Some years ago, Edward
took his first mistress,

05:39.469 --> 05:42.518
something I accepted. It seemed

05:42.738 --> 05:45.873
easier than being required
to be a "wife" in that regard.

05:46.562 --> 05:48.376
Does that answer your question?

05:49.212 --> 05:50.839
Thank you for your candour.

05:51.946 --> 05:55.416
Do you recall anything unusual
prior to his disappearance?

05:55.451 --> 05:57.148
Not that I remember.

05:57.586 --> 06:00.151
Though a woman did call
at the house the same day

06:00.179 --> 06:03.772
I reported Edward missing. She
was anxious to speak to him.

06:03.892 --> 06:06.105
- Who was she?
- I don't know.

06:06.225 --> 06:09.176
She was distraught, but not
enough to leave her name.

06:12.082 --> 06:13.568
Thank you, Mrs. Mclnnes.

06:13.602 --> 06:16.520
If there is anything
else, I will contact you.

06:20.537 --> 06:23.347
Should you wish to speak to
my husband's current mistress,

06:23.352 --> 06:24.812
her name is Lucy Stone.

06:24.847 --> 06:26.518
I believe he had installed her

06:26.551 --> 06:29.477
in a flat above a
milliner's on Yonge Street.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.011
So his wife knows where I live.

06:32.131 --> 06:33.361
She does.

06:33.815 --> 06:36.852
I bet she didn't shed a
tear over Edward being dead.

06:37.426 --> 06:39.661
It seems they had an agreement.

06:39.695 --> 06:41.041
Yes.

06:41.555 --> 06:45.334
Thank you. It was
something his wife arranged.

06:47.309 --> 06:50.371
But that's all in the past now.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.173
Poor Eddie.

06:54.777 --> 06:56.844
When did your relationship begin?

06:57.368 --> 06:58.978
Nearly two years ago.

06:59.421 --> 07:00.826
And we were happy too,

07:00.849 --> 07:02.635
no matter what his wife might tell you.

07:02.818 --> 07:05.136
We saw each other as much as we could,

07:05.154 --> 07:08.573
what with his... responsibilities.

07:08.977 --> 07:11.059
Did you see him the night of his death?

07:13.442 --> 07:15.096
Uh, no...

07:15.711 --> 07:17.065
Why was that?

07:19.534 --> 07:21.102
Well, truth be told, Detective,

07:21.136 --> 07:23.164
he stopped visiting three months ago.

07:23.546 --> 07:25.775
Did he give you a reason?

07:26.162 --> 07:28.123
He found another girl, I suppose.

07:29.134 --> 07:31.120
Still, he was...

07:31.714 --> 07:34.290
honourable enough to keep paying my rent

07:34.296 --> 07:36.891
and sending me a little something.

07:39.962 --> 07:43.024
I know I won't be much
welcome at his funeral,

07:43.253 --> 07:46.513
but I would very much like
to see him one more time.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.063
I can arrange that, Miss Stone.

07:49.694 --> 07:50.961
Thank you.

07:51.343 --> 07:53.939
I just can't accept that
Sarah would kill herself.

07:54.420 --> 07:56.545
We opened her up and there
was no water in her stomach.

07:56.562 --> 07:58.094
I don't understand how you can drown

07:58.128 --> 07:59.362
and have no water in your stomach.

07:59.408 --> 08:01.873
Any wrongdoing and your doctor
would've figured that out.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.966
- You say she's sharp.
- She is, but maybe she made a mistake.

08:06.925 --> 08:09.210
You know, I still can't
fathom this, Becca.

08:09.752 --> 08:11.419
Cutting open dead people?

08:11.854 --> 08:14.217
I just took out a man's
liver and put it in a bottle.

08:14.455 --> 08:17.045
Then I did his kidney and his spleen.

08:17.255 --> 08:19.727
- How's that for a morning's work?
- Disgusting.

08:19.762 --> 08:21.101
I've got used to it.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.894
I just see body bits now.

08:23.281 --> 08:24.902
- We all have them.
- We do

08:25.022 --> 08:26.429
and they don't belong in jars,

08:26.451 --> 08:28.503
that's plain unholy.

08:28.537 --> 08:30.785
- I don't know, maybe your friend...
- Sarah.

08:31.067 --> 08:33.534
Could be she had things going
on she didn't talk about.

08:34.044 --> 08:35.743
Things she took to the grave.

08:36.462 --> 08:38.446
Why not let her rest in peace, Becca?

08:39.438 --> 08:40.655
You're wrong,

08:40.837 --> 08:42.784
but I don't have time to argue with you.

08:43.095 --> 08:44.678
I have to get to the school.

08:45.286 --> 08:48.003
Well, argue with me at the church
social. You are coming, aren't you?

08:48.052 --> 08:49.192
Yes.

08:49.236 --> 08:51.492
I got roped into borrowing
chairs from the school for it.

08:51.527 --> 08:53.594
Well, I'll get a wagon, give you a hand.

08:53.629 --> 08:54.879
You will?

08:54.999 --> 08:57.248
Come on, Becca, that
was your plan all along.

08:57.368 --> 08:58.958
Well, yes it was.

09:01.260 --> 09:03.307
Make sure you don't crash up that thing.

09:03.639 --> 09:05.586
Don't worry, I won't.

09:27.362 --> 09:29.999
For centuries we have lived in darkness,

09:30.625 --> 09:32.107
but no more.

09:32.157 --> 09:35.269
We are throwing off the
cloak of ignorance, ladies.

09:35.537 --> 09:37.750
A year ago, a microbiologist

09:37.773 --> 09:39.637
a Doctor David Bruce

09:39.676 --> 09:42.122
found parasites in the
blood of a European man

09:42.150 --> 09:43.926
suffering from, of all things,

09:44.046 --> 09:46.909
African sleeping sickness.
Formal name, anyone?

09:47.673 --> 09:51.634
- Yes, Miss Roy.
- African trypanosomiasis.

09:51.954 --> 09:53.217
Thank you.

09:53.337 --> 09:56.521
Now, those same parasites
had been previously found

09:56.558 --> 09:58.941
in trout and frogs.

09:59.149 --> 10:01.829
Were they the cause of the man's malady?

10:01.864 --> 10:03.831
Or, if so,

10:03.866 --> 10:06.792
how had they been
transmitted to the victim?

10:07.168 --> 10:10.137
- Miss Baxter?
- Via Glossina Morsitans.

10:10.172 --> 10:11.755
Ah yes, indeed!

10:11.799 --> 10:15.724
The fancy Latin term for
the ubiquitous tsetse fly.

10:15.844 --> 10:19.414
So now we have the cause,
the specific microbe;

10:19.712 --> 10:22.119
the search for a treatment begins.

10:23.093 --> 10:25.486
It's a thrilling time to be in medicine.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.820
Cures will be found and
deadly diseases eradicated

10:28.824 --> 10:30.956
in your lifetime, ladies.

10:31.076 --> 10:32.439
Though in the meantime, I suggest

10:32.489 --> 10:34.462
you stay away from the tsetse fly.

10:37.197 --> 10:40.119
Professor Hempel, our
final exam results?

10:40.239 --> 10:42.122
I believe they will be posted tomorrow.

10:42.825 --> 10:44.147
Now good day.

10:48.203 --> 10:49.746
Drowned?

10:50.244 --> 10:52.811
That's truly, truly awful.

10:53.582 --> 10:55.229
Poor Sarah.

10:57.415 --> 10:59.754
You were both in the same
study group, weren't you?

10:59.943 --> 11:02.256
Yes. We spent hours together.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.010
Was she upset about
something that would give her

11:04.038 --> 11:05.487
cause to take her own life?

11:05.607 --> 11:08.149
Nothing at all. Has to
be some kind of accident.

11:08.269 --> 11:09.997
She was graduating,

11:10.032 --> 11:12.951
starting work with Professor
Hempel, lucky thing.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.503
- Why kill herself?
- I know.

11:15.537 --> 11:17.111
I feel the same way.

11:17.231 --> 11:20.442
- Maybe it has something to do with her beau.
- I wouldn't call him a beau.

11:20.442 --> 11:21.554
Who is he?

11:21.616 --> 11:24.266
- His name is...
- We shouldn't say anything, Anne.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.605
Why not?

11:25.904 --> 11:27.746
Sarah was very private.

11:27.866 --> 11:30.750
She's dead, it's a bit late for secrets.

11:32.521 --> 11:33.993
Alright then.

11:34.447 --> 11:36.524
His name's Bernard Winston.

11:36.558 --> 11:38.906
He's a medical student
in his final year.

11:39.127 --> 11:41.119
Just a second, who are you again?

11:41.596 --> 11:43.399
You were a friend of Sarah's.

11:44.041 --> 11:45.800
I still can't believe it.

11:46.541 --> 11:48.876
We were supposed to have
supper at my hall last night,

11:48.899 --> 11:50.066
but she didn't show up.

11:50.186 --> 11:51.872
Did you get into an argument?

11:51.907 --> 11:53.774
Was she upset about something?

11:53.809 --> 11:55.151
What do you mean?

11:55.693 --> 11:57.578
You think I had
something to do with this?

11:57.612 --> 12:00.214
I'm just trying to understand
what happened, Mr. Winston.

12:00.966 --> 12:02.583
How long had you known her?

12:02.765 --> 12:04.276
We met at the inauguration

12:04.287 --> 12:06.196
of the new medical building in October.

12:07.037 --> 12:09.790
Right off the bat, her
intelligence shone through.

12:10.108 --> 12:11.856
You were attracted to her brain?

12:11.976 --> 12:13.350
That's novel.

12:13.829 --> 12:15.796
My father pushed me into medical school,

12:15.831 --> 12:18.725
but I'm more cut out for the
cricket pitch than study hall.

12:19.483 --> 12:22.470
I would've been out on my ear
months ago without Sarah's help.

12:22.504 --> 12:24.438
Sounds like you owe her a lot.

12:25.763 --> 12:27.268
It wasn't all work.

12:28.502 --> 12:30.478
Our knowledge of anatomy wasn't...

12:30.826 --> 12:32.348
purely academic.

12:34.008 --> 12:36.150
She was happy, Miss James,

12:37.223 --> 12:39.186
excited about the future.

12:46.396 --> 12:48.454
I talked to her friends,
and no one can fathom

12:48.463 --> 12:50.142
Sarah taking her own life.

12:51.105 --> 12:54.358
The suicide of someone close
can be hard to comprehend,

12:54.768 --> 12:57.471
and the reason why Miss
Franklin made that choice

12:57.506 --> 12:59.607
is, no doubt, very complex.

13:00.058 --> 13:03.377
- You may never have an answer.
- Bit what if she didn't kill herself?

13:07.872 --> 13:09.217
Miss James,

13:09.388 --> 13:11.081
without evidence of foul play,

13:11.120 --> 13:12.692
there's nothing we can do about it.

13:12.703 --> 13:14.274
You understand that, don't you?

13:17.047 --> 13:18.596
Then let's turn our attention to what

13:18.624 --> 13:20.826
poison killed Mr. Mclnnes.

13:21.573 --> 13:24.384
Reinsch has proven unhelpful.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.912
Could you set up for the Gutzeit test?

13:39.615 --> 13:42.370
And the science laboratory is
to be at the end of this wing.

13:42.420 --> 13:44.385
Yes, for my wife and myself.

13:44.419 --> 13:47.354
I suppose she's behind the
automated dishwashing cupboard.

13:47.389 --> 13:49.370
Actually, that's my idea.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.445
I have detailed specifications here...

13:51.461 --> 13:54.488
Which I have studied
carefully, Detective Murdoch.

13:54.522 --> 13:57.023
No matter the peculiarities
of the room contents,

13:57.039 --> 13:58.827
it's still a bricks-and-
mortar construction

13:58.834 --> 14:01.671
- for which I am well qualified.
- Yes.

14:01.732 --> 14:03.338
From your prospectus,

14:03.360 --> 14:05.773
it's clear that you are
thoroughly competent.

14:05.807 --> 14:08.345
Now, did you make note
of these roof lines?

14:08.367 --> 14:10.364
Unconventional but sound.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.096
Nothing that can't be constructed.

14:12.129 --> 14:15.399
I've designed them this way so
that rainwater can be collected,

14:15.454 --> 14:17.983
stored and reused for irrigation...

14:18.038 --> 14:22.211
that is until I install the internal
cooling system that will work...

14:22.239 --> 14:24.925
Can I ask when you will be
making a decision, Detective?

14:25.570 --> 14:27.578
Oh, that could be years.

14:27.921 --> 14:30.013
The technology required
for such a system

14:30.031 --> 14:33.115
- is still in its infancy...
- I mean on which contractor you'll be using.

14:33.377 --> 14:36.321
There are a number of people
considering my services.

14:36.705 --> 14:37.687
Oh.

14:38.113 --> 14:42.003
Well, I'm... I'm sure you can
appreciate this decision is considerable

14:42.014 --> 14:44.438
and not one to be made in haste.

14:44.642 --> 14:47.901
I will contact you in
due time, Mr. Binks.

14:47.934 --> 14:50.467
Detective Murdoch. Madam.

14:53.825 --> 14:55.436
Patience is not a virtue

14:55.453 --> 14:57.682
amongst the city's contractors.

14:58.546 --> 15:00.995
Isn't Mr. Binks the seventh
man you've interviewed?

15:01.029 --> 15:02.838
Yes, and he made the short list

15:02.844 --> 15:04.703
based on his budget parsimony.

15:04.736 --> 15:08.327
But I don't think he fully appreciates
the intricacies of my design, Julia.

15:08.565 --> 15:11.657
He doesn't need to appreciate
it to build it, surely.

15:12.349 --> 15:15.071
Wasn't he a contractor
on the King Edward Hotel?

15:15.191 --> 15:16.343
Yes.

15:16.378 --> 15:18.900
That hasn't fallen down yet.

15:19.404 --> 15:21.102
That isn't the point.

15:21.174 --> 15:23.784
Well, what is the point
of a builder but to build?

15:24.351 --> 15:25.653
Don't answer that.

15:25.687 --> 15:28.191
I have the results on Mr. Mclnnes.

15:29.192 --> 15:30.658
Arsenic poisoning.

15:30.692 --> 15:33.794
Likely administered
by several small doses.

15:33.828 --> 15:35.796
The accumulation eventually killed him.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.865
I also found a purgative in his system.

15:38.146 --> 15:41.602
Hmm, that would explain the vomit
that was found on his clothing.

15:41.636 --> 15:44.338
An unsuccessful attempt
to save him perhaps.

15:44.564 --> 15:46.340
Do you have any suspects?

15:46.374 --> 15:49.777
At this point, two. Wife and mistress.

15:49.811 --> 15:53.161
Wife and mistress? Some
motive there surely.

15:53.281 --> 15:54.596
So you would think,

15:54.607 --> 15:57.523
but the arrangement
seemed to suit all parties.

15:57.778 --> 16:00.267
- How terribly French!
- Hmm...

16:01.883 --> 16:03.149
So,

16:03.515 --> 16:06.860
am I to assume that Mr.
Binks is off your list?

16:06.980 --> 16:10.413
We can do better, Julia.

16:30.585 --> 16:32.588
Dr. Stowe-Gullen.

16:32.621 --> 16:34.989
Yes, Miss James. How can I help you?

16:35.241 --> 16:37.205
It's about Sarah Franklin.

16:37.570 --> 16:40.851
Yes, I was very saddened
to hear the news.

16:41.196 --> 16:42.993
I just saw her exam result. I...

16:43.253 --> 16:46.617
- I don't understand how she could fail.
- I am equally mystified.

16:46.628 --> 16:48.653
Miss Franklin was one
of our best students.

16:48.773 --> 16:52.273
She would have made an exceptional
research scholar for Professor Hempel.

16:52.307 --> 16:54.375
She just needed to pass this exam.

16:54.751 --> 16:56.377
Maybe there was some mistake.

16:56.704 --> 16:59.299
Perhaps her exam was muddled
up with some other student's.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.208
There's no mistake, Miss James.

17:02.010 --> 17:03.687
This is what she handed in.

17:08.348 --> 17:09.755
She didn't write a word.

17:09.948 --> 17:12.798
Deliberately sabotaging
her bright future.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.032
Why she would do that?

17:16.040 --> 17:17.434
I'm afraid she took the answer

17:17.451 --> 17:18.890
with her to the grave, Miss James.

17:23.156 --> 17:24.626
Goodbye, Edward.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.388
Rest in peace.

17:30.961 --> 17:32.821
I'm sorry for your loss, Miss Stone.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.445
Thank you.

17:35.774 --> 17:38.288
Detective, I know you
didn't have to allow this.

17:38.565 --> 17:40.842
I appreciate the courtesy.

17:46.140 --> 17:48.021
I believe her grief is genuine.

17:48.428 --> 17:51.000
It certainly seems so.

17:51.527 --> 17:52.536
Julia,

17:52.903 --> 17:54.780
did you see her complexion?

17:54.900 --> 17:58.171
I noticed it the first time I
met her. She seems overly pale.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.685
Yes. She could be anaemic,

17:59.915 --> 18:03.789
though she was perspiring and
I also noted her odorous breath.

18:03.909 --> 18:05.117
Is she ill?

18:05.237 --> 18:07.493
Those are classic symptoms
of mercury treatment.

18:07.671 --> 18:11.230
Mercury's primary use is in
the treatment of syphilis, no?

18:11.682 --> 18:14.369
Yes. It has limited results, but

18:14.489 --> 18:16.241
in the absence of a cure...

18:17.325 --> 18:19.472
Julia, if Miss Stone is syphilitic,

18:19.494 --> 18:20.946
then there's every possibility

18:20.964 --> 18:22.996
that Mr. Mclnnes was as well.

18:24.257 --> 18:25.310
Anne,

18:25.345 --> 18:26.585
Katherine,

18:27.103 --> 18:29.166
did you see Sarah's exam result?

18:29.188 --> 18:31.078
I couldn't believe it. Big fat zero.

18:31.198 --> 18:33.035
That doesn't make any
sense. Why would she do that

18:33.048 --> 18:34.824
- if she already knew the...
- Katherine...

18:36.701 --> 18:37.563
What?

18:37.683 --> 18:39.649
You're the one who said you
didn't want to keep quiet.

18:39.946 --> 18:42.102
Don't be idiotic. Think
of the consequences.

18:42.124 --> 18:44.469
There are no consequences
for me; I didn't believe her!

18:44.496 --> 18:45.709
Believe what?

18:47.997 --> 18:50.335
Well, the cat's out of the bag
now, you might as well know.

18:50.976 --> 18:53.772
Sarah hadn't been pulling
her weight in our study group.

18:53.807 --> 18:56.987
She stopped coming to classes, spent
all of her time in the laboratory.

18:57.018 --> 19:00.391
She expected us to pick up the
slack and give her our notes.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.608
And we got sick of doing her work.

19:02.617 --> 19:04.282
We tried to throw her
out of the study group,

19:04.551 --> 19:05.880
let her sink or swim, but

19:06.721 --> 19:08.146
she begged us not to.

19:08.204 --> 19:10.055
Swore up and down
she'd make it up to us.

19:10.089 --> 19:12.290
- And she did, too.
- How?

19:13.348 --> 19:15.194
The next time we saw her, she was

19:15.264 --> 19:18.178
very sure about the
questions on the final exam.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.299
Told us exactly what to study.

19:21.218 --> 19:22.301
She was right.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.392
Anne got a great mark.

19:24.835 --> 19:25.813
And you?

19:26.806 --> 19:28.774
Unfortunately, I didn't listen to her.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.718
How did Sarah know the exam questions?

19:33.590 --> 19:35.747
I think it has something
to do with Bernard Winston.

19:35.933 --> 19:38.349
- Why?
- He's no bright shining light,

19:38.380 --> 19:41.386
but he scored top marks in the
same exam at the men's college.

19:41.904 --> 19:43.630
How do you think he managed that?

19:45.325 --> 19:46.720
I'll get back to you.

19:49.664 --> 19:51.129
Is that our builder?!

19:51.470 --> 19:52.727
Mr. Cole?

19:53.267 --> 19:54.223
Perhaps.

19:54.595 --> 19:57.503
Though he did laugh at my
notion of a standing bath.

19:57.537 --> 19:59.313
So he has a sense of humour;

19:59.800 --> 20:02.641
- you can't penalize him for that.
- This is an important decision.

20:02.675 --> 20:05.505
Yes, and one that must be made, soon.

20:05.545 --> 20:08.069
I won't place our home
into the wrong hands.

20:08.671 --> 20:10.315
Whose hands are the right hands?

20:10.350 --> 20:11.954
I haven't found them yet.

20:12.415 --> 20:15.354
Let's face it, William, you
think you should build our house.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.345
Me?

20:17.288 --> 20:19.081
No one man can do that.

20:19.201 --> 20:21.037
Well, of course they can't.

20:21.626 --> 20:24.193
But perhaps with the right crew,

20:24.313 --> 20:26.131
some competent craftsman...

20:26.165 --> 20:28.500
Of course, you would have
to have a very good foreman.

20:28.535 --> 20:29.699
William!

20:30.303 --> 20:31.776
I was joking.

20:32.739 --> 20:33.821
Oh.

20:34.139 --> 20:35.702
Let's talk about this later.

20:35.822 --> 20:37.509
I've made an interesting discovery.

20:37.818 --> 20:39.310
Come to my office.

20:42.630 --> 20:45.165
Syphilis is a truly insidious disease.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.282
It can invade the nervous system
at even the earliest stages.

20:48.309 --> 20:50.667
So to that end, I
re-examined Mr. Mclnnes

20:50.690 --> 20:53.062
and discovered he had ocular syphilis.

20:53.359 --> 20:55.627
- It was affecting his eyesight.
- Mm-hmm.

20:55.662 --> 20:57.719
So he would have known
he was a carrier then.

20:57.931 --> 20:59.207
Most likely.

20:59.636 --> 21:01.729
Which would explain why he stayed away

21:01.734 --> 21:03.969
from his wife and stopped
seeing his mistress.

21:04.003 --> 21:06.236
He was trying to be responsible.

21:06.271 --> 21:08.488
A little too late for
Miss Stone however.

21:08.550 --> 21:10.184
He sentenced her to death.

21:10.224 --> 21:11.406
Or as least madness.

21:11.419 --> 21:14.080
Actually, there has been
some scientific progress.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.095
Two scientists from Germany,

21:16.126 --> 21:18.393
Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann,

21:18.418 --> 21:20.752
have identified the causative bacteria.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.979
"Treponema pallidum spirochete."

21:26.926 --> 21:30.095
But how to eradicate the bacteria
without harming the patient?

21:30.636 --> 21:32.791
That is the next scientific challenge.

21:33.699 --> 21:36.568
So you think syphilis plays
a role in Mr. Mclnnes' death?

21:37.036 --> 21:39.803
Given his domestic
arrangement, perhaps it does.

21:42.736 --> 21:43.976
Mr. Winston!

21:44.171 --> 21:46.871
- What do you want now?
- You cheated on your final exam.

21:47.513 --> 21:49.000
Not here.

21:53.232 --> 21:55.529
- What are you talking about?
- Don't pretend you don't know!

21:55.751 --> 21:58.362
You stole the exam questions
and gave them to Sarah!

21:58.553 --> 22:00.216
She threatened to
expose you, didn't she?

22:00.261 --> 22:01.739
You don't know what
you're talking about.

22:01.775 --> 22:03.428
She was going to tell
so you shut her up.

22:03.463 --> 22:05.197
- I didn't.
- You threw her in the river.

22:05.231 --> 22:07.339
You've got it all wrong, you silly fool!

22:07.405 --> 22:08.934
Oh, you can tell that to the police.

22:09.140 --> 22:11.513
I didn't give the exam to
Sarah; she gave it to me.

22:11.531 --> 22:14.036
- What do you mean?
- She told me what to study.

22:14.589 --> 22:16.708
- You're lying.
- She knew the questions.

22:17.134 --> 22:18.794
- How?
- I don't know.

22:19.445 --> 22:20.746
I didn't want to know.

22:21.331 --> 22:23.081
Oh, God, are you gonna tell?

22:23.116 --> 22:24.177
Are you?

22:24.947 --> 22:27.523
Please don't!

23:03.346 --> 23:06.980
_

23:25.745 --> 23:26.828
Miss James.

23:27.293 --> 23:28.333
Detective.

23:28.453 --> 23:29.829
What are you doing here?

23:32.237 --> 23:33.652
I...

23:34.242 --> 23:36.584
I've been looking into
Sarah Franklin's death.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.890
Oh, Miss Franklin? The suicide?

23:39.377 --> 23:41.718
I... Well, I found something.

23:41.749 --> 23:43.232
Not that I should have been looking.

23:43.644 --> 23:44.751
That's quite all right.

23:44.871 --> 23:45.955
What did you find?

23:48.677 --> 23:51.041
I found an address in Sarah's locker.

23:53.564 --> 23:57.884
"RS-100, 2040 Rosehill Avenue."

23:58.477 --> 24:00.078
I just discovered who lives there.

24:00.354 --> 24:01.643
Edward Mclnnes.

24:02.705 --> 24:04.688
I believe the two cases are connected.

24:06.162 --> 24:07.619
I believe you're right.

24:12.081 --> 24:15.627
So Miss Franklin had the exam in advance

24:15.631 --> 24:18.999
and shared it with Bernard Winston
and the rest of her study group,

24:19.265 --> 24:22.463
- but then handed in a blank exam?
- Yes.

24:22.730 --> 24:25.239
And you think she was going
to report the cheating?

24:25.602 --> 24:27.754
How else to explain the blank exam?

24:27.839 --> 24:29.241
And none of this explains why

24:29.276 --> 24:33.194
Sarah had the address of a
murdered businessman in her locker.

24:33.278 --> 24:36.218
Perhaps Sarah was Mr.
Mclnnes' new mistress.

24:37.187 --> 24:38.989
You think she killed him for

24:39.024 --> 24:41.233
whatever reason and
then took her own life?

24:41.313 --> 24:43.420
Or perhaps someone killed them both.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.744
Now, this is the woman in question.

24:47.107 --> 24:49.997
Well, Miss James, I must
commend your initiative.

24:50.180 --> 24:52.577
Really? Oh, I'm so relieved.

24:52.697 --> 24:54.092
I thought you'd be more disapproving.

24:54.114 --> 24:56.066
Oh, heavens, no. An inquisitive mind

24:56.093 --> 24:58.577
- must be encouraged.
- Thank you, Mrs. Mclnnes.

25:01.606 --> 25:03.314
The victim's wife confirms

25:03.336 --> 25:05.611
that Miss Franklin did
indeed come to the home

25:05.625 --> 25:08.356
looking for Mr. Mclnnes
the day after he died.

25:08.580 --> 25:11.348
She also noted that Miss
Franklin seemed distraught,

25:11.383 --> 25:12.919
though she had no idea why.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.986
Perhaps there's more to
learn at the medical school.

25:15.008 --> 25:16.898
Dr. Stowe-Gullen may be helpful.

25:17.018 --> 25:18.500
Precisely where I'm headed now.

25:18.536 --> 25:20.086
May I ride with you, Detective?

25:20.294 --> 25:22.162
I have an assignment
to finish and hand in.

25:22.594 --> 25:23.835
Of course.

25:28.352 --> 25:30.944
Miss Franklin was a
most meticulous student,

25:31.303 --> 25:33.270
though happier in the
lab than the classroom.

25:33.587 --> 25:35.455
What was her field of study?

25:35.641 --> 25:37.815
She wanted to work on
identifying compounds

25:37.837 --> 25:40.196
- to combat bacterial disease.
- Oh?

25:40.364 --> 25:43.061
It's a very new field.
I admire her ambition.

25:43.278 --> 25:44.854
She was to be a research scholar

25:44.854 --> 25:46.709
for our esteemed Professor Hempel.

25:47.019 --> 25:48.574
Of all the students in the country,

25:48.596 --> 25:50.030
he chose our Miss Franklin.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.477
I was so proud of her.

25:52.831 --> 25:54.452
She will be sorely missed.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.559
I would like to speak
with this Professor Hempel.

25:57.874 --> 25:58.954
Of course.

25:59.427 --> 26:02.685
Miss Franklin had a burning curiosity.

26:03.268 --> 26:05.942
Not unlike a detective, I suppose.

26:06.102 --> 26:08.217
Now, that distinguished her. That,

26:08.226 --> 26:09.740
as well as her ambition.

26:10.125 --> 26:12.002
Yes. The study of bacteria.

26:12.077 --> 26:14.051
She was dedicated to
the long-term pursuit of

26:14.056 --> 26:16.623
a therapia sterilisans magna,

26:16.743 --> 26:19.495
a treatment that manages
to kill the harmful bacteria

26:19.517 --> 26:22.199
without causing any damage
to a patient's healthy cells.

26:22.704 --> 26:24.935
"Magic in a bottle," I called it.

26:25.323 --> 26:26.378
It's a bit of a dream,

26:26.498 --> 26:28.986
actually, but that
wasn't going to stop her.

26:29.216 --> 26:30.460
This your work?

26:31.235 --> 26:34.316
Yes, uh, I'm researching
African sleeping sickness.

26:34.515 --> 26:37.414
I'm just a rank amateur compared
to my European colleagues,

26:37.423 --> 26:40.270
but I'm keen to find a way to
protect the brave missionaries

26:40.283 --> 26:41.806
working on the Dark Continent.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.577
Miss Franklin couldn't wait
to start working with me.

26:45.599 --> 26:47.808
Did she seem distressed lately?

26:48.104 --> 26:49.401
Not at all.

26:49.521 --> 26:52.168
That is why this has been
such a terrible shock.

26:53.226 --> 26:55.772
Yes. Why destroy her future

26:55.775 --> 26:58.538
by deliberately
sabotaging her final exam?

26:58.769 --> 27:00.349
I have no idea.

27:00.690 --> 27:02.318
I can only guess she had

27:02.438 --> 27:04.036
some sort of a breakdown.

27:04.328 --> 27:08.002
Melancholia is often
the companion of genius.

27:08.206 --> 27:09.210
Hmm.

27:09.330 --> 27:12.203
Do you know the exam
questions in advance?

27:12.247 --> 27:13.610
Good Lord, no.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.226
A province-wide affair.
Tightly guarded, I gather.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.134
Yes, of course, of course.

27:19.144 --> 27:23.147
Did Miss Franklin ever
mention a Mr. Mclnnes to you?

27:23.356 --> 27:24.927
"Mclnnes"?

27:25.047 --> 27:27.246
No, I don't recognize the name.

27:29.654 --> 27:31.622
Thank you for your time, Professor.

27:41.830 --> 27:44.787
Julia. Julia. Have a look at this.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.906
Some of Miss Franklin's research.

27:47.026 --> 27:50.470
She had been working... with arsenic.

27:50.702 --> 27:53.343
Do you think she had something
to do with Mr. Mclnnes' death?

27:53.378 --> 27:55.865
She had the means, she
could be the killer.

27:56.058 --> 27:58.471
But what's her connection?
She wasn't intimate with him.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.197
Or if she was, she wasn't infected.

28:00.218 --> 28:01.791
I re-examined her.

28:04.619 --> 28:07.116
William, this research.

28:07.392 --> 28:10.324
Miss Franklin wasn't
working with pure arsenic.

28:10.329 --> 28:12.790
She was using arsenic compounds.

28:13.064 --> 28:17.093
- We know arsenic kills but when...
- In combination with other elements,

28:17.102 --> 28:19.083
- could also cure.
- Exactly.

28:20.507 --> 28:23.003
Some of these formulas
are very sophisticated.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.152
She had been using
rats as test subjects.

28:27.362 --> 28:29.182
With some success.

28:29.597 --> 28:32.082
Julia, what if she was onto something?

28:54.739 --> 28:56.564
Oh, thank you.

29:47.897 --> 29:49.308
Here it is!

29:49.645 --> 29:52.262
Miss Franklin was
trying to eradicate this!

29:52.297 --> 29:54.277
Nasty-looking thing.

29:54.397 --> 29:55.971
"Trypanosome."

29:55.999 --> 29:59.030
Spiral-shaped parasite that
causes sleeping sickness.

29:59.042 --> 30:00.547
Oh, that makes sense.

30:00.591 --> 30:03.186
Miss Franklin had begun
working with Professor Hempel.

30:03.306 --> 30:05.642
He is researching sleeping sickness.

30:06.683 --> 30:10.032
Julia, this illustration
reminds me of...

30:10.669 --> 30:12.196
Oh yes!

30:13.218 --> 30:14.325
Where are you going?

30:14.353 --> 30:16.804
The research journal you were
showing me only yesterday.

30:16.860 --> 30:18.237
What of it?

30:18.459 --> 30:22.550
The causal agent for
syphilis. Here it is.

30:23.685 --> 30:26.241
- They look quite similar.
- They do.

30:26.678 --> 30:29.749
In fact, the scientists who
discovered the syphilis bacteria

30:29.766 --> 30:31.398
made the same observation.

30:31.951 --> 30:34.513
Could the treatment for
one also treat the other?

30:34.878 --> 30:36.588
You think the professor
and Miss Franklin

30:36.593 --> 30:39.543
were researching syphilis
as well as sleeping sickness?

30:40.328 --> 30:42.602
But if so, why not tell me?

30:42.722 --> 30:44.927
Well, any breakthrough
in the cure for syphilis

30:44.927 --> 30:46.808
would be an enormous scientific coup.

30:46.830 --> 30:48.628
It's the stuff of Nobel Prizes.

30:48.639 --> 30:50.548
It would relieve the
suffering of millions.

30:51.089 --> 30:53.038
So they kept their work a secret.

30:54.056 --> 30:55.346
Julia,

30:55.466 --> 30:58.068
the compounds that Miss
Franklin had been working with,

30:58.107 --> 31:00.874
could they be lethal if
given in frequent doses?

31:00.946 --> 31:02.307
What are you thinking?

31:02.484 --> 31:05.129
Perhaps Miss Franklin's
rats were not enough.

31:05.383 --> 31:07.751
They needed a human subject.

31:19.259 --> 31:20.742
What are you doing in here?

31:20.776 --> 31:22.363
I'm just a cleaner, sir.

31:22.397 --> 31:23.929
I am almost finished.

31:24.516 --> 31:27.775
Well, hurry it up. I
have a lot of work to do.

31:28.302 --> 31:30.144
Yes, sir.

31:33.882 --> 31:35.917
Haven't I... ?

31:36.941 --> 31:39.341
Yes, I have seen you before.

31:39.461 --> 31:41.029
You're no cleaner.

31:41.077 --> 31:44.646
You're that new student in
second year. The special case.

31:45.552 --> 31:47.365
What are you doing in my office?

31:47.766 --> 31:49.197
Nothing.

31:49.599 --> 31:50.965
What are you looking for?

31:52.434 --> 31:53.992
Answer me, girl!

33:04.053 --> 33:06.357
I know you're in here.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.230
I just want to talk to you.

33:26.241 --> 33:28.787
Now, young lady...

33:30.312 --> 33:32.780
... what were you doing in my office?

33:40.422 --> 33:42.730
Wouldn't want to see you expelled

33:42.850 --> 33:44.692
from the college.

33:49.631 --> 33:51.798
I know about Sarah...

33:52.334 --> 33:54.633
and about the cheating
on the final exam.

33:54.654 --> 33:56.556
We had important work to do,

33:56.605 --> 33:59.592
- she had to pass.
- You gave her the questions!

33:59.620 --> 34:02.910
If I hadn't, she was going
to fail, so yes. What of it?

34:04.459 --> 34:06.314
Is that what you were looking for?

34:07.664 --> 34:10.203
Planning a little cheating
yourself, were you?

34:12.471 --> 34:14.489
What papers were you burning?

34:16.820 --> 34:17.859
Who are you?

34:17.893 --> 34:20.443
What does RS-100 mean?

34:22.630 --> 34:24.565
What's your name?

34:26.187 --> 34:27.601
Rebecca James.

34:27.996 --> 34:29.952
Well, Miss James,

34:30.310 --> 34:32.106
you must be quite a bright thing

34:32.141 --> 34:34.283
to be accepted into the college.

34:34.743 --> 34:36.634
Perhaps we can come to an agreement.

34:37.021 --> 34:38.478
What does that mean?

34:38.514 --> 34:40.889
I'll need a new research assistant.

34:41.387 --> 34:43.985
You could step into
Miss Franklin's shoes.

34:45.078 --> 34:46.353
Are you interested?

34:48.088 --> 34:50.030
No, you don't.

35:03.630 --> 35:05.206
Detective Murdoch!

35:06.724 --> 35:07.902
Mr. Desmond.

35:08.074 --> 35:10.293
I'm sure glad to see you, Detective.

35:10.553 --> 35:11.825
Is everything all right?

35:11.847 --> 35:13.491
I'm looking for Rebecca.

35:13.706 --> 35:15.759
Now, we "was" supposed to
meet at the church social,

35:15.771 --> 35:17.176
but she didn't show up.

35:17.296 --> 35:18.886
That's not like her.

35:19.301 --> 35:21.193
No, no, it's not.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.527
I'll let you in on a little secret:

35:27.241 --> 35:30.064
I am on the verge of a major discovery

35:30.098 --> 35:31.916
that you could be a part of.

35:32.790 --> 35:35.803
Miss Franklin would be proud of you,

35:36.221 --> 35:38.639
another woman entering the field.

35:41.599 --> 35:43.678
You stole Sarah Franklin's work.

35:43.712 --> 35:45.516
Is that what she told you?

35:45.636 --> 35:47.320
She didn't tell me anything!

35:48.116 --> 35:49.944
She was no angel.

35:50.118 --> 35:52.699
She had more than enough
reason to take her own life.

36:01.867 --> 36:04.146
Oh, my God! Where is she?

36:05.247 --> 36:06.534
Rebecca!

36:06.908 --> 36:08.927
Becca, are you here?!

36:11.173 --> 36:13.581
- Argh!
- UP HERE!

36:30.934 --> 36:32.926
Don't make a sound.

36:50.974 --> 36:53.657
Detective, I am very pleased to see you.

36:53.690 --> 36:55.599
I caught this woman
rifling through my office.

36:55.617 --> 36:57.911
I want her arrested for
burglary and assault.

36:58.177 --> 37:01.370
Professor, take your hands
off Miss James this instant.

37:01.575 --> 37:04.103
If you say, Detective.

37:04.369 --> 37:05.826
You alright, Becca?

37:05.861 --> 37:07.301
Detective,

37:07.421 --> 37:09.331
he gave Sarah the exam,

37:09.497 --> 37:12.004
- and he stole her work.
- I'm afraid your Miss James

37:12.031 --> 37:14.837
has some cockeyed
notion about her friend.

37:17.050 --> 37:18.223
Now,

37:18.638 --> 37:20.292
why are you here, Detective?

37:20.325 --> 37:21.885
Well, Professor, since we last spoke,

37:21.902 --> 37:24.104
I looked a little further
into your research.

37:24.120 --> 37:27.279
In particular, the similarities
between the causal agents

37:27.399 --> 37:29.731
of syphilis and sleeping sickness.

37:29.757 --> 37:31.357
You have done your homework.

37:31.905 --> 37:33.869
Did you know Edward Mclnnes?

37:34.218 --> 37:35.456
No.

37:35.977 --> 37:39.176
- Was he RS-100?
- RS...

37:39.718 --> 37:43.187
I believe that was Miss
Franklin's coding system.

37:44.116 --> 37:46.335
I hate to speak ill of the dead...

37:46.982 --> 37:48.169
Go on.

37:48.543 --> 37:50.988
She had her lab rats, but she...

37:51.237 --> 37:53.313
she talked about
needing a human subject.

37:53.433 --> 37:55.725
So Miss Franklin knew Mr. Mclnnes?

37:55.742 --> 37:57.805
If he was RS-100,

37:57.983 --> 38:00.661
- yes, I think she did.
- He's lying!

38:00.855 --> 38:02.731
He's the one who treated Mr. Mclnnes.

38:02.736 --> 38:05.049
- Don't be ridiculous!
- I can prove it!

38:06.648 --> 38:08.391
This was in his fireplace, sir.

38:08.441 --> 38:10.638
Pieces of Mr. Mclnnes' medical records.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.807
Professor Hempel was treating him.

38:12.851 --> 38:14.550
He was burning the evidence.

38:14.670 --> 38:17.383
Detective, she came to me and
confessed what she had done.

38:17.394 --> 38:19.143
I was merely trying to help.

38:19.774 --> 38:21.411
You gave him the purgative?

38:21.433 --> 38:24.205
Yes, I tried to save
him, but it was too late.

38:24.325 --> 38:26.833
Sarah didn't give a
patient an unproven formula.

38:26.953 --> 38:30.043
- She would never do that!
- You didn't know her.

38:31.509 --> 38:32.831
Professor,

38:33.215 --> 38:35.216
you're coming with me.

38:41.003 --> 38:42.519
Miss James was right.

38:42.552 --> 38:45.247
Sarah Franklin did not kill Mr. Mclnnes.

38:45.844 --> 38:47.449
She'd gone to his home

38:47.569 --> 38:49.889
to find him the day after he died.

38:50.465 --> 38:52.539
Had she learned that you'd
been using her formulas?

38:52.595 --> 38:55.599
Sarah Franklin wasn't a saint.

38:56.019 --> 38:57.414
What does that mean?

38:57.851 --> 38:59.904
I learned of the similarities
between the agents

38:59.920 --> 39:02.360
for sleeping sickness and syphilis.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.346
When I saw the progress Sarah was making

39:04.346 --> 39:07.381
on arsenical compounds, I
proposed we work together.

39:07.578 --> 39:09.476
She was excited at the prospect,

39:09.493 --> 39:11.385
and she gave me her formula.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.421
What of Mr. Mclnnes?

39:13.455 --> 39:15.256
Well, he had done his own research.

39:15.376 --> 39:18.041
He knew the syphilis
bacteria had been identified

39:18.041 --> 39:20.127
so he came to me begging for help.

39:20.162 --> 39:23.431
He was fully aware of the risks.

39:23.685 --> 39:25.433
So you began treating him

39:25.467 --> 39:27.435
with Miss Franklin's arsenic compounds.

39:27.469 --> 39:30.004
- Did she know about this?
- Yes.

39:30.038 --> 39:32.898
She was as ambitious as I.

39:33.683 --> 39:36.937
Then a few weeks into the treatment,
her lab rats started to die.

39:37.013 --> 39:39.208
She tried adjusting the
arsenic levels in the compound,

39:39.214 --> 39:41.148
but it was too late.
The damage was done.

39:41.549 --> 39:43.684
And Mr. Mclnnes began dying as well.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.574
- He was desperate.
- Of course he was,

39:48.056 --> 39:50.091
but you were the doctor, the scientist.

39:50.125 --> 39:51.683
You should have urged caution.

39:52.205 --> 39:54.197
Don't be naive, Detective.

39:54.383 --> 39:56.432
You think progress is made without risk,

39:56.445 --> 39:58.080
without intuitive leaps?

39:58.509 --> 40:00.801
That's what separates great
minds from the ordinary.

40:01.762 --> 40:03.949
And that's what you
saw in Sarah Franklin...

40:04.148 --> 40:07.999
- a great mind, a risk taker?
- I did,

40:08.119 --> 40:10.392
but I was wrong. She was weak.

40:10.512 --> 40:12.772
She couldn't cope with her failure

40:12.807 --> 40:14.980
and she suffered the
consequences at her own hand.

40:16.060 --> 40:18.683
You put a dying man in his own car,

40:18.710 --> 40:20.730
drove him to a remote area

40:20.850 --> 40:24.442
and left him there to be
found by a night watchman.

40:24.913 --> 40:27.868
You're under arrest for the
murder of Edward Mclnnes.

40:31.967 --> 40:35.010
- You let Sarah Franklin think it was all her fault!
- Miss James...

40:35.590 --> 40:37.471
Well, it was her compound.

40:37.471 --> 40:39.588
That you administered to Edward Mclnnes!

40:39.641 --> 40:42.386
Medical research is a
demanding field, my dear.

40:42.877 --> 40:46.197
I've often wondered if the
fairer sex is up to the challenge.

40:46.317 --> 40:48.875
Well, given the empirical
evidence of Sarah Franklin,

40:49.517 --> 40:50.588
seems they are not.

40:50.667 --> 40:52.381
All right, that's enough, Professor.

40:52.403 --> 40:54.063
Take him.

40:56.502 --> 40:58.781
He's wrong, Detective.

40:59.565 --> 41:02.216
Yes, Miss James. He is wrong.

41:05.624 --> 41:08.665
Well, it's been an exciting
week at the college.

41:08.678 --> 41:10.631
Your Miss James is quite a pistol.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.566
Yes, I believe she's
coming into her own.

41:12.610 --> 41:14.655
I hope the morgue can
contain her energy.

41:14.731 --> 41:16.262
I'm sure you'll find a way.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.356
Julia, I have a proposal.

41:19.802 --> 41:21.830
I'm setting up a course
in forensic medicine,

41:21.839 --> 41:23.791
- and I want you to teach it.
- Me?

41:24.073 --> 41:25.756
I think you'd be a wonderful example

41:25.787 --> 41:28.311
for our students to emulate.

41:28.342 --> 41:30.333
That's very flattering,

41:30.713 --> 41:32.891
but I must warn you the research methods

41:32.905 --> 41:35.650
I'd like to pursue might
be somewhat unorthodox.

41:35.684 --> 41:36.985
That doesn't trouble me.

41:37.012 --> 41:39.893
Medical research is
still uncharted territory.

41:40.287 --> 41:43.647
There is no progress without
ruffling a few feathers.

41:44.311 --> 41:46.994
Then I'd be delighted to
stir up some controversy.

41:47.029 --> 41:48.752
I can always count on you.

41:55.674 --> 41:57.932
Alright. Wait. Wait.

42:02.110 --> 42:04.129
Since you missed the party, Becca.

42:05.266 --> 42:06.377
Come here.

42:14.625 --> 42:16.560
Now what got into you anyway,

42:16.985 --> 42:18.441
poking around some

42:18.561 --> 42:20.621
white man's study when you
could have been living it up

42:20.623 --> 42:21.703
at the church social?

42:21.721 --> 42:24.159
- I could have bested him.
- Really?

42:24.805 --> 42:26.456
But it was good to see you there.

42:28.003 --> 42:29.595
Maybe it's time for you to put that

42:29.648 --> 42:32.436
moonlight detective work
on the back burner, Becca.

42:32.622 --> 42:33.654
Says who?

42:33.876 --> 42:35.513
- Says me.
- Really?

42:35.811 --> 42:36.778
Admit it.

42:37.035 --> 42:38.376
You need protection.

42:38.801 --> 42:41.430
Admit it. You're envious.

42:41.903 --> 42:43.391
You know we make a good team.

42:43.635 --> 42:45.649
Oh, you think so, do you?

42:49.324 --> 42:51.186
When are you gonna give that up?

42:52.103 --> 42:53.387
I...

42:58.060 --> 42:59.693
When are you gonna give it up?

43:04.461 --> 43:06.926
Patience, Mr. Desmond.

43:07.910 --> 43:09.246
I promise,

43:09.649 --> 43:11.588
it will be worth the wait.
