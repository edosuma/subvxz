WEBVTT

00:24.524 --> 00:26.317
Fires are mostly out.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.570
There's nothing left
to salvage.

00:28.653 --> 00:32.323
I'll take a wagon into town,
get some supplies.

00:32.406 --> 00:34.909
No.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.245
We go...

00:37.328 --> 00:39.789
back to Chinatown.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.416
What are you talking about?

00:43.752 --> 00:45.754
We no belong here.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.508
I promise you, Strickland
will not get away with this.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.347
He already did.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.183
No, Ah Toy, wait!

00:58.266 --> 00:59.809
You cannot take these girls
back to the brothel.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.686
We worked so hard to get
them out of that life!

01:01.770 --> 01:04.938
You no protect them.

01:05.022 --> 01:07.359
You no protect them here.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.197
In Chinatown, I can.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.701
They were happy here.

01:22.164 --> 01:24.918
Happy mean nothing
if you dead.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.282
You have a cop problem.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.910
Bad enough you have
one living in here.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.579
Now there's another outside.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.706
Multiplying like
fucking rabbits.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.668
The Secret Service
isn't interested in us.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.086
A badge is a badge.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.129
Look, I don't like
it either, but--

03:36.633 --> 03:37.966
Everything all right?

03:38.051 --> 03:39.469
Yeah.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.347
Jack and I were just
catching up.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.350
I got to restock the bar.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.144
- You good?
- Mm.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.407
Hey, cop.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.497
Let me ask you something.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.250
You really care about her?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.543
I do.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.255
Not that it's any
of your business.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.800
You are standing
in my business--

04:18.882 --> 04:21.553
you and that smiley
fuck outside.

04:24.431 --> 04:29.060
Now, if you care about her
like you say you do,

04:29.144 --> 04:32.689
you will take
that piece of tin...

04:32.772 --> 04:36.359
and your lily-white ass
and get back where you belong.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.820
And where's that?

04:38.903 --> 04:40.864
Anywhere but here.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.123
You take longer
to put on your face

04:50.206 --> 04:53.126
than my third ex-wife.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.211
What's our next move?

04:55.295 --> 04:58.298
Well, most counterfeiters,

04:58.381 --> 04:59.924
ones that aren't
outright idiots,

05:00.008 --> 05:01.509
spend small at first,

05:01.593 --> 05:03.303
check to see
if their bills pass muster

05:03.386 --> 05:05.055
before they make any big moves.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.514
So we sweep Chinatown,

05:06.598 --> 05:09.934
check for any phony papers
in the local shops.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.312
By the way...

05:12.395 --> 05:15.106
let's meet at the station
from here on out.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.525
Sure, though
I will sorely miss

05:17.609 --> 05:19.819
your neighborhood's
charming aroma.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.200
Well, thank God you came by.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.577
Otherwise Bernard
would still be going on

05:27.660 --> 05:29.162
about that new horse of his.

05:29.245 --> 05:32.248
If you saw Apollo,
you'd understand my enthusiasm.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.709
His sire set a record
at the Preakness back in '76.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.586
You see
what I'm dealing with?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.963
Darling, you're going to bore
Mai Ling to tears.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.383
Actually,
I'm quite fond of horses.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.135
My father used to take me to
the Mongolian horse markets

05:44.219 --> 05:45.720
when I was a girl.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.848
God, they had these
gorgeous white stallions.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.726
I made him promise
to buy me one someday.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.771
Connoisseur
and a businesswoman...

05:54.854 --> 05:56.981
you are full of surprises.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.693
Well, then I hope
you'll forgive my boldness,

05:59.776 --> 06:02.987
but, well, I was wondering
if you'd given any thought

06:03.071 --> 06:04.823
to our conversation
at the gallery.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.575
Actually, I have.

06:07.659 --> 06:11.329
I'll admit, diversifying your
assets outside of Chinatown

06:11.413 --> 06:13.373
will be tricky,
but it can be done.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.582
There's no reason

06:14.666 --> 06:16.418
why you shouldn't be able
to conduct business

06:16.501 --> 06:18.211
- like other Americans.
- I agree.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.088
The rules barring
Chinese ownership

06:20.171 --> 06:22.799
are nothing but rank
political posturing.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.218
If only more people here
shared your sentiments.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.012
Bernard will find a way.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.139
He's brilliant
at that sort of thing.

06:33.308 --> 06:36.813
If I were to hold your money
in a proprietary account

06:36.896 --> 06:39.441
at the bank as part
of my personal portfolio,

06:39.524 --> 06:42.610
I could gradually take
positions for you

06:42.694 --> 06:45.238
across various industries--
with your approval, of course.

06:45.321 --> 06:47.615
And what kind of industries
are we talking about?

06:47.699 --> 06:50.869
Railroads,
construction, agriculture.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.038
The possibilities
are countless,

06:53.121 --> 06:56.041
assuming you've got the stomach
for some risk.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.918
I think you'll find I've
got the stomach for it.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.186
When can we start?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.104
Do you feel that,
when the rhythm changes?

07:18.188 --> 07:19.856
That's when
you go harder, okay?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.567
Okay. I'm not going to be
able to get this right.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.444
You know, you spin
those sticks around your head

07:24.527 --> 07:28.865
with absolute precision, but
ask a man to turn a crank...

07:28.948 --> 07:30.825
Your father taught you this?

07:30.909 --> 07:32.452
He didn't teach me anything,

07:32.534 --> 07:35.372
not while there
was a son to teach.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.667
I taught myself,
watched him work.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.878
I'd practice on the press
at night after we closed shop,

07:41.961 --> 07:43.296
and it's a good thing I did,

07:43.380 --> 07:45.465
'cause my brother
turned out to be an idiot.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.677
And if I hadn't stepped in,
we would have lost the shop,

07:48.760 --> 07:51.346
which he's going
to inherit anyway.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.722
So why learn, then?

07:52.806 --> 07:55.225
A Chinese woman in America
without a skill

07:55.308 --> 07:57.227
is either going to be
a prostitute

07:57.310 --> 08:01.231
or ends up being labeled one
and deported.

08:04.567 --> 08:08.196
You ever think
about going back?

08:08.279 --> 08:10.323
To China?

08:10.407 --> 08:12.325
No.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.869
Why?
Do you?

08:14.953 --> 08:17.080
Not anymore.

08:17.163 --> 08:21.918
You know,
my father isn't perfect...

08:22.002 --> 08:25.255
but he sacrificed everything
to bring us here to America.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.173
And in spite
of how awful it's been,

08:27.257 --> 08:30.260
I still really think
it's the land of opportunity.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.511
People like us just need to try
a little bit harder

08:32.595 --> 08:34.222
to find it, that's all.

08:36.433 --> 08:40.145
I guess San Francisco
has its charms...

08:40.227 --> 08:42.355
aside from all the people
who want us dead.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.524
I don't plan
on staying here forever.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.318
My father's sick,
and--and when he's gone,

08:47.402 --> 08:50.447
there isn't going to be
anything left keeping me here.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.198
So no China,

08:52.282 --> 08:54.951
no Chinatown.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.120
Where will you go?

08:57.203 --> 09:00.290
Maybe north, I think.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.542
I hear there's a lot
of open spaces out there.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.961
Maybe I'll find
something I like

09:05.045 --> 09:07.839
and make something of my own.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.055
With this,
I have to confiscate it.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.765
I'm sorry.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.479
It's official.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.564
I will not be eating
in Chinatown.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.733
Those are actually
pretty good.

09:26.816 --> 09:27.984
Any luck with him?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.028
He only had one ten
in the till.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.363
Came back queer.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.031
Wasn't too pleased
about parting with it neither.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.616
No, I imagine he wasn't.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.118
I figure we split up,
work the rest of this block,

09:37.202 --> 09:38.578
then expand our grid.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.622
Pattern will emerge.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.248
You can hang your hat on that.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.335
I can see why the other cops
didn't like you.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.546
You actually work for a living.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.203
I saw an interesting article
in the "Register" today,

10:20.286 --> 10:23.873
about Thayer's brother-in-law
being an opium addict.

10:23.957 --> 10:28.336
I suppose every family
has their skeletons.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.547
If you know where to dig.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.843
You know, Miss Archer,
it's surprising

10:34.926 --> 10:37.971
to find a woman of your
intelligence and background

10:38.054 --> 10:39.222
who isn't married.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.849
You're wondering
what skeletons

10:40.932 --> 10:42.642
might be lurking in my closet.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.936
- Is that it?
- No, of course not.

10:47.814 --> 10:48.940
I meant no offense.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.233
Relax, Mr. Buckley.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.360
My skin is thicker
than it looks.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.071
Of course,
my family expected me

10:55.155 --> 10:56.865
to be married up years ago,

10:56.948 --> 10:59.576
but I was more interested
in traveling the world

10:59.659 --> 11:02.162
- than being tied down.
- And now?

11:02.245 --> 11:05.165
I would think a woman like you
would have her pick of suitors.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.709
And you would be wrong.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.086
I'm suddenly a woman
of a certain age,

11:10.170 --> 11:12.130
and as such,
I'm expected to entertain

11:12.213 --> 11:14.674
a parade of sad widowers,

11:14.758 --> 11:18.553
fading bachelors,
and pitiful eccentrics--

11:18.636 --> 11:20.889
the price I paid
for my independence,

11:20.972 --> 11:22.599
and well worth it.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.102
I cherish my freedom...

11:26.186 --> 11:28.897
which is why it takes
a special kind of man

11:28.980 --> 11:30.523
to make an impression on me.

11:32.817 --> 11:33.735
Oh, dear.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.654
Have I stunned you
into silence, Mr. Buckley?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.533
Call me Walter.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.993
Walter.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.544
Don't mind the looky-loos.

11:51.628 --> 11:54.547
Seeing you out with a woman
is good for your campaign.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.132
Perhaps.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.134
But I wonder
what you will think of me

11:58.218 --> 11:59.928
if I lose the election.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.430
I would think no less of you.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.525
But I'm not going
to let you lose.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.127
I heard about Sonoma.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.048
I'll go after them.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.384
It's too late for that.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.052
What are you talking about,
Ah Toy?

14:04.135 --> 14:06.513
Come on, talk to me.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.848
I have a business to run.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.101
Wait.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.936
I'm fine.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.901
Ah Toy!

14:22.696 --> 14:24.155
Maybe take a few days.

14:24.239 --> 14:27.158
Let Chao handle things
till you're feeling up to it.

14:30.328 --> 14:34.790
Do you have any idea how long
it took to put this dress on?

15:02.527 --> 15:04.404
Cheers.
Cheers.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.114
Good to see you.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.914
Did we take
a wrong turn somewhere?

15:14.998 --> 15:15.999
Trust me.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.335
We're exactly
where we're meant to be.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.762
What the fuck is this place?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.555
It's a private club

15:30.638 --> 15:33.141
for people who share
a certain joie de vivre,

15:33.224 --> 15:36.770
a place without boundaries,
where everyone is welcome.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.943
- Ah, Monsieur Marcel.
- Oh.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.570
Welcome back.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.156
Would you prefer the blue
or the green?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.494
Oh, excellent choice.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.788
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.180
That was disgusting.

16:12.263 --> 16:16.184
Mm, I promise you're going
to love it when it kicks in.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.436
Come on.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.605
Hey...

16:20.689 --> 16:22.399
there's more.

17:00.937 --> 17:04.315
I think I'm going
to like it here.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.656
Yuxian.

17:12.741 --> 17:13.782
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

17:13.867 --> 17:17.119
Watch the suit,
you clumsy bitch.

17:17.203 --> 17:21.750
Well, you can make it up to me.
Come on, let's have some fun.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.877
- Hey!
- Come on, let's go upstairs.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.962
Stop!
Let go!

17:26.046 --> 17:28.548
Stop it!

17:28.631 --> 17:31.468
Lai.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.136
Go upstairs...

17:35.889 --> 17:36.973
Now.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.854
Ah Toy, long time no see.

17:42.937 --> 17:47.025
Respect my girls or you're out. Get me?

17:47.108 --> 17:48.234
Sure. No problem.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.492
- Sergeant O'Hara.
- Everything all right?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.160
Things seem
a little tense in here.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.996
Was just small disagreement.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.707
I take care of it.

18:02.791 --> 18:06.711
For last week, extra,
when I not in town.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.505
You may wish you
hadn't come back.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.716
The new police chief is, uh...

18:11.800 --> 18:14.052
coming down hard on Chinatown.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.429
That what red envelope for.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.390
Well, you've always
done right by me, but...

18:18.473 --> 18:20.642
things are changing.

18:20.725 --> 18:24.729
I may not be able to keep
trouble from your door forever.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.321
In Chinatown...

18:33.405 --> 18:36.491
no one think about forever...

18:36.574 --> 18:40.245
only today, maybe tomorrow.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.172
Thank you all for coming.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.674
I've called
this press conference

18:52.757 --> 18:54.509
to address a salacious article

18:54.592 --> 18:58.555
the "Register" saw fit
to publish about my family,

18:58.638 --> 19:00.765
specifically...

19:00.849 --> 19:03.643
my brother-in-law's
unfortunate opium habit.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.855
First and foremost,
it's important to acknowledge

19:06.938 --> 19:10.817
that this isn't news,
strictly speaking,

19:10.900 --> 19:14.362
but a hit piece
planted by my opponent

19:14.446 --> 19:16.990
without corroboration
in a desperate attempt

19:17.073 --> 19:19.159
to bolster
a faltering campaign.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.203
- There is no reason--
- Do you deny the report, then?

19:29.169 --> 19:30.462
No.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.423
I do not.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.926
I'm only sorry
that Howard's private struggle

19:37.010 --> 19:39.346
has been made public
because of my candidacy.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.807
My brother-in-law
was wounded in battle

19:42.891 --> 19:45.977
in the service of his country.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.395
Like so many others,

19:47.479 --> 19:51.483
his pain did not end
when the fighting stopped.

19:51.566 --> 19:56.154
And it is the intention
of my family...

19:56.237 --> 19:59.115
to love and support him...

19:59.199 --> 20:01.826
however we can.

20:01.910 --> 20:05.121
As with so many things,
compassion,

20:05.205 --> 20:08.667
not judgment,
must be our guiding light.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.942
You're unfocused today.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.169
Too slow.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.629
Sloppy.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.350
So...

22:30.433 --> 22:32.185
you want to talk about it?

22:38.858 --> 22:40.151
It's Mai Ling.

22:40.235 --> 22:43.154
She's spending
more and more time in the pond.

22:43.238 --> 22:44.989
You must have known
her ambitions

22:45.073 --> 22:47.367
would reach beyond the confines
of Chinatown.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.661
This feels different.

22:49.744 --> 22:52.122
Are you worried about her...

22:52.205 --> 22:53.832
or the tong?

22:53.915 --> 22:55.875
She isn't safe out there.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.878
She won't let me protect her.

22:58.962 --> 23:01.798
Mai Ling is very smart...

23:01.881 --> 23:05.468
but sometimes it's the smartest
ones who forget to be wise.

23:07.220 --> 23:10.390
Good thing she has you
to remind her.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.102
Now...

23:16.479 --> 23:18.565
We going to fight or what?

23:23.486 --> 23:25.864
Regardless,
the state of California

23:25.947 --> 23:29.034
is well within its rights
to assert eminent domain.

23:29.117 --> 23:32.412
It has offered just
compensation to Miss Davenport

23:32.495 --> 23:35.498
and has clearly demonstrated
its public use as a route--

23:35.582 --> 23:37.625
A privately owned
and managed railroad

23:37.709 --> 23:39.627
does not constitute public use.

23:39.711 --> 23:42.422
Might I remind the court
that we have proffered

23:42.505 --> 23:44.632
multiple witnesses
who will testify

23:44.716 --> 23:47.469
that Miss Davenport
was housing prostitutes

23:47.552 --> 23:49.054
on her so-called vineyard.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.847
That is outrageous,
Judge Hopkins.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.684
Miss Davenport has a long
and well-documented history

23:54.768 --> 23:57.228
of liberating young women
from bondage.

23:57.312 --> 23:59.856
- These girls were her employees.
- I've heard enough.

23:59.939 --> 24:04.277
My ruling is that the state
has just grounds

24:04.361 --> 24:07.655
to exercise
its constitutional powers.

24:07.739 --> 24:09.574
Eminent domain stands.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.203
Wait.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.038
Your Honor, please!

24:15.121 --> 24:17.165
You can't let him get away
with this.

24:17.248 --> 24:18.291
Wha--

24:18.375 --> 24:20.377
- Charles, I don't understand.
- I did what I could.

24:25.048 --> 24:26.549
No.
Miss Davenport.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.926
This isn't over.

24:30.053 --> 24:31.304
I'm sorry, Nellie.

24:31.388 --> 24:33.098
I know you were hoping
for a different outcome.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.391
If there's anything I can do--

24:34.474 --> 24:36.101
I always knew you
were a shit, Douglas.

24:36.184 --> 24:37.977
You just hid it better
than my husband.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.854
But I didn't know
you were a monster.

24:39.938 --> 24:42.691
Please understand that all
I want, all I've ever wanted,

24:42.774 --> 24:45.485
was to see you taken care of,
however I could.

24:45.568 --> 24:46.903
You just couldn't stand

24:46.986 --> 24:48.697
not having something
that you wanted,

24:48.780 --> 24:51.074
so you took it, like a--
like a petulant child!

24:51.157 --> 24:52.909
I can see you're upset,

24:52.992 --> 24:55.328
but I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:55.412 --> 24:56.621
You killed them.

24:56.705 --> 24:59.124
You murdered my girls,
and for what?

24:59.207 --> 25:01.710
For more money,
as if you didn't have enough.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.921
You are sick, Douglas.

25:05.005 --> 25:08.591
You are a twisted,
despicable creature.

25:10.260 --> 25:14.347
No, this man,
this man is a murderer.

25:18.018 --> 25:20.353
Bernard and his friends
are obsessed with the game.

25:20.437 --> 25:22.147
Personally, I don't see
what's so thrilling

25:22.230 --> 25:24.566
about knocking
little balls around.

25:24.649 --> 25:25.859
Well, there is
a little bit more

25:25.942 --> 25:27.444
to it than that, darling,
but, uh...

25:27.527 --> 25:30.030
admittedly, it is more fun
when there's money at stake.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.532
But the real appeal is
escaping their nagging wives.

25:34.242 --> 25:37.162
Oh, I seem to have run dry.
I'll go get us a fresh bottle.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.664
That sounds delightful.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.708
Oh, I, uh--
I meant to tell you--

25:41.791 --> 25:45.170
I'm looking at providing
high-interest bridge loans

25:45.253 --> 25:47.589
using the capital you provided.

25:47.672 --> 25:50.550
They'll, uh, bring in
a substantial return,

25:50.633 --> 25:53.178
but we--we have to move slowly

25:53.261 --> 25:54.888
to avoid
any unwanted attention.

25:54.971 --> 25:56.598
And your fee?

25:56.681 --> 25:58.767
Well, given
our personal relationship,

25:58.850 --> 26:03.188
I'll keep it modest--
say, uh, 5%.

26:03.271 --> 26:05.106
Let's make it 10%.

26:05.190 --> 26:08.026
I intend for this to be a long
and fruitful arrangement

26:08.109 --> 26:09.152
for the both of us.

26:11.154 --> 26:13.406
You, um...

26:13.490 --> 26:15.033
really are...

26:17.077 --> 26:19.329
Quite beautiful.

26:21.289 --> 26:23.917
Wait. Stop.
What are you doing?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.878
- You must have misunderstood.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.925
I hope
I haven't spoiled things.

26:32.008 --> 26:33.551
Not at all.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.553
We all make mistakes.

26:35.637 --> 26:38.723
No need to let it
affect our partnership.

27:01.454 --> 27:04.249
Oh, good.
You're here.

27:04.332 --> 27:06.459
Yeah, I-I think
I found something.

27:06.543 --> 27:08.461
They say the state
of a man's office

27:08.545 --> 27:11.047
is a reflection
of his state of mind.

27:11.131 --> 27:13.425
The thing is this is my office.

27:13.508 --> 27:16.052
I've been through every
territory in Chinatown,

27:16.136 --> 27:17.262
testing bills,

27:17.345 --> 27:19.055
and most of them
came back clear,

27:19.139 --> 27:20.849
except for the ones
in this pile.

27:20.932 --> 27:22.475
Where did you find them?

27:22.559 --> 27:24.936
I pulled a few off
a highbinder in a Hop Wei suit

27:25.020 --> 27:28.648
and a few more
in shops here, here...

27:30.567 --> 27:33.486
- And here.
- All in Hop Wei territory.

27:33.570 --> 27:34.863
It makes sense.

27:34.946 --> 27:38.033
With the increased police
presence and enforcement,

27:38.116 --> 27:39.451
cash must be tight.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.453
So where are my plates?

27:41.536 --> 27:44.289
My best guess...

27:44.372 --> 27:46.916
Hop Wei headquarters.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.127
It's the most fortified spot.

27:49.210 --> 27:53.006
And here I was, wondering
what we were going to do today.

27:55.467 --> 27:57.302
Now, we're going
to need some backup.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.304
- I'll go tell Bill.
- Well, I'll tell Atwood.

27:59.387 --> 28:01.514
Why should you have
all the fun?

28:28.667 --> 28:30.835
You're pretty handy
with that blade.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.882
- Care for a turn?
- I prefer using my hands.

28:38.802 --> 28:41.554
Speaking of hands...

28:41.638 --> 28:44.766
I hear Mr. Pierce
has some new holes in his.

28:44.849 --> 28:47.811
The man insulted me
in me own bar.

28:47.894 --> 28:50.230
Then I admire your restraint.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.234
I took care of your problem,
Mr. Strickland,

28:54.317 --> 28:56.945
but now I'm left
with one of my own.

28:57.028 --> 29:00.365
Pierce promised
to hire 40 of my men.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.367
Look, you want me
to hire 40 Irishmen,

29:02.450 --> 29:04.327
I'll hire 40 Irishmen.

29:04.411 --> 29:07.372
But you'll still be precisely
where you are right now--

29:07.455 --> 29:09.582
fighting to gain
every sad little inch.

29:09.666 --> 29:12.002
I've got hungry men
banging down my door.

29:12.085 --> 29:14.587
They'll take every inch
they can get.

29:14.671 --> 29:17.590
As long as you keep begging
wealthy men for scraps,

29:17.674 --> 29:19.843
that's all they'll receive.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.762
You have things people want,
Mr. Leary--

29:22.846 --> 29:25.181
votes, workers, influence.

29:25.265 --> 29:27.392
Yeah, so I'm told.

29:27.475 --> 29:30.729
But it hasn't put
my people back to work.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.981
Because Buckley
takes your votes for granted

29:33.064 --> 29:36.192
and Thayer
supports Chinese labor.

29:36.276 --> 29:37.193
Put it this way--

29:37.277 --> 29:39.279
you can't beat
this problem with your fists.

29:39.362 --> 29:41.114
You can't outspend
the industrialists.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.991
If you're telling me
the game's rigged,

29:43.074 --> 29:45.535
it's not fucking news.

29:45.618 --> 29:48.246
How much do you think
this ring is worth?

29:48.329 --> 29:50.123
No idea.

29:50.206 --> 29:52.959
But based on the finger
that's wearing it,

29:53.043 --> 29:54.794
I'd say a lot.

29:54.878 --> 29:57.172
I don't think it's worth $2,

29:57.255 --> 30:00.008
but I value it
more than anything I own

30:00.091 --> 30:02.010
because of who I took it from.

30:02.093 --> 30:04.387
Money isn't everything,
Mr. Leary.

30:04.471 --> 30:07.265
Power comes to those
who are willing to seize it.

30:07.349 --> 30:09.017
I don't know
what we're talking about here.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.852
Talking about an alliance.

30:10.935 --> 30:13.021
Work with me,

30:13.104 --> 30:16.107
and I'll show you
how you win this game.

30:16.191 --> 30:18.818
What do you get out of it?

30:18.902 --> 30:21.654
I have big plans
for California,

30:21.738 --> 30:26.493
but I can't realize them
without government approval,

30:26.576 --> 30:29.829
without laws, workers.

30:29.913 --> 30:32.499
You can help me get them.

30:32.582 --> 30:34.209
How do you figure that?

30:34.292 --> 30:36.211
The details can wait.

30:36.294 --> 30:38.880
Come on,
let's have another drink.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.840
Tomorrow you can tell
your working men

30:40.924 --> 30:43.051
you did as you promised.

30:43.134 --> 30:44.761
40 jobs, right?

30:53.103 --> 30:56.606
Judge Milton Hopkins...

30:56.690 --> 30:59.317
Mr. Dylan Leary,
my guest of honor this evening.

30:59.401 --> 31:02.070
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Leary.

31:02.153 --> 31:03.863
Who are they?

31:03.947 --> 31:06.741
Do you really need
to know their names?

31:16.960 --> 31:18.545
- Stone.
- Mm-hmm.

31:18.628 --> 31:22.549
Take three men, set up
a perimeter around the corner.

31:22.632 --> 31:25.010
- Anderson, Cartwright.
- Yes, boss.

31:25.093 --> 31:26.553
Cut off passage to the west.

31:26.636 --> 31:28.930
If you see any black suits
running, shoot to kill.

31:29.014 --> 31:30.265
Yes, sir.

31:30.348 --> 31:33.518
The rest of you gentlemen
are with me.

31:38.189 --> 31:40.108
Now, that is how you win--

31:40.191 --> 31:42.527
beautiful hand,
not that chicken shit hand

31:42.610 --> 31:43.903
that Hong keeps winning with.

31:43.987 --> 31:46.114
You know, we're letting
you win, right, boss?

31:47.991 --> 31:50.535
Letting me win?
Get the fuck out of here, Hong.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.537
Hey, come on, we'll be here
all night. Let's go.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.626
Up against the wall!

31:58.710 --> 32:00.754
Secret Service.
Nobody move.

32:03.465 --> 32:05.133
Nice and easy.

32:05.216 --> 32:06.676
Nobody do shit.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.303
Right, line them up.
Let's go, boys.

32:08.386 --> 32:11.639
Come on!
Come over here!

32:15.560 --> 32:18.271
- You fuck.
- You, get over there.

32:21.691 --> 32:24.778
You two take the hallway.
I'll have a gander upstairs.

32:35.872 --> 32:38.958
So this is
the Hop Wei tong...

32:39.042 --> 32:43.630
the most terrifying band
of highbinders in Chinatown.

32:43.713 --> 32:45.590
They're certainly
the best dressed.

32:45.674 --> 32:47.676
You know what I see?

32:49.719 --> 32:51.471
Fear...

32:53.264 --> 32:55.266
Weakness...

32:56.476 --> 32:59.813
Subhuman excrement

32:59.896 --> 33:02.565
wrapped in silk.

33:05.944 --> 33:09.280
Gentlemen, show them
what we're about!

33:13.284 --> 33:15.412
You really think these guys
are stupid enough

33:15.495 --> 33:17.414
to print counterfeits
in their own backyard?

33:17.497 --> 33:19.207
I reckon I won't know
till I look.

33:19.290 --> 33:20.625
Ready?

33:29.259 --> 33:31.011
Fuck, no.

33:42.731 --> 33:45.984
That look
like a secret door to you?

33:46.067 --> 33:49.446
Don't gloat.
It doesn't suit you.

33:59.664 --> 34:02.625
Looks like you want
to say something, boy.

34:02.709 --> 34:05.045
Go on, out with it.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.466
Sorry. I...

34:09.549 --> 34:11.885
I-I didn't catch that.

34:11.967 --> 34:15.347
Fuck your mother's
smelly pussy.

34:17.056 --> 34:20.060
With stones like those...

34:20.143 --> 34:22.520
I gather you're in charge.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.983
So you want to be
the big man, huh?

34:28.818 --> 34:31.487
Now's your chance.

34:50.674 --> 34:52.509
Do it, princess.

34:52.592 --> 34:55.219
Come on, make a fucking move.

35:02.268 --> 35:05.814
- There's nothing here.
- I can see that, Bill.

35:08.608 --> 35:11.111
They moved something,
something heavy.

35:11.194 --> 35:14.489
Someone must have warned
them we were coming.

35:14.572 --> 35:16.449
Fuck.

35:16.533 --> 35:18.952
San Francisco
Police Department!

35:19.035 --> 35:21.079
- Get up against the wall!
- Whoa, whoa.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.330
- Come here.
- What?

35:22.414 --> 35:23.373
Come here.

35:23.456 --> 35:27.335
Okay, the bulls--
they've got us boxed in.

35:27.419 --> 35:28.753
We can't go back.

35:28.837 --> 35:30.797
Let's just leave it here.
They might not check the cart.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.549
No, if they do,
the tong is screwed.

35:32.632 --> 35:34.342
I need to get these plates
out of here.

35:34.426 --> 35:35.927
Look at me. Look at me.

35:36.011 --> 35:37.303
Hey! Hey!

35:37.387 --> 35:38.847
This isn't your problem.
Just go home.

35:38.930 --> 35:39.973
They won't stop you.

35:40.056 --> 35:41.474
Well, what are
you going to do?

35:41.558 --> 35:42.642
I'll figure something out.

35:42.726 --> 35:44.477
- That is so stupid.
- Yeah.

35:44.561 --> 35:47.188
- You need a plan.
- I like to improvise.

35:47.272 --> 35:48.523
Hey, take off your jacket.

35:48.606 --> 35:50.150
They're looking
for Hop Wei, right?

35:50.233 --> 35:52.152
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35:54.112 --> 35:55.989
Hey, let's go.

35:56.072 --> 35:57.782
Whoa.

36:15.258 --> 36:18.261
This is not your house.

36:20.388 --> 36:22.015
- Hey!
- Lee, no.

36:22.098 --> 36:24.476
This is not your tong.

36:24.559 --> 36:26.519
Chief, he's had enough.

36:28.021 --> 36:30.732
- You have nothing.
- Chief.

36:32.567 --> 36:35.195
- You are nothing.
- Chief, he's had enough.

36:39.282 --> 36:41.910
Chief, he's done.

36:45.205 --> 36:47.832
Don't you ever...

36:47.916 --> 36:49.959
lay a finger on me again.

36:52.504 --> 36:54.214
Arrest this man.

36:54.297 --> 36:56.091
He assaulted an officer.

37:17.153 --> 37:19.114
- Shit.
- Hey.

37:19.197 --> 37:21.324
- There's more cops to the right.
- Then go the other way.

37:25.787 --> 37:27.497
- Excuse me!
- Aw, shit.

37:27.580 --> 37:30.333
- You there!
- Keep going.

37:30.417 --> 37:33.128
Don't look at him.

37:33.211 --> 37:35.839
San Francisco Police.

37:35.922 --> 37:38.258
I need to check that wagon.

37:38.341 --> 37:41.553
- What do we do now?
- I'm working on it.

37:43.179 --> 37:45.306
You, stop!

37:45.390 --> 37:46.683
Turn left.

37:54.649 --> 37:56.276
Come on, boys.

37:58.486 --> 38:00.905
It's a dead end.
We can't get out.

38:00.989 --> 38:02.490
Neither can they.

38:04.993 --> 38:06.619
Wait, what?

38:12.208 --> 38:14.586
Fuck is your problem, lady?

38:16.046 --> 38:17.589
Didn't you hear us?

38:17.672 --> 38:19.632
Where's the other one?

38:19.716 --> 38:22.635
Your fucking friend...

38:22.719 --> 38:24.971
where is he?

38:26.139 --> 38:30.518
This bitch doesn't understand
a word you're saying.

38:30.602 --> 38:33.730
Talking slower ain't going to
make a shit bit of difference.

38:33.813 --> 38:38.026
There's only one language
these people understand.

38:40.403 --> 38:42.405
Let's take a look.

38:42.489 --> 38:44.240
What the fuck?

39:03.802 --> 39:05.845
Stone!
Harrison!

39:07.263 --> 39:10.058
What the hell is going on?

40:06.698 --> 40:09.576
Up you go, you piece of shit.

40:09.659 --> 40:11.119
Get in there!

40:14.497 --> 40:17.125
- Come on, come on! Let's go!
- Right, let's move it out!

40:19.502 --> 40:22.130
Chao tipped them off.

40:22.213 --> 40:25.342
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

40:25.425 --> 40:28.053
You must have known he would.

40:28.136 --> 40:30.138
I thought we'd be faster.

40:34.893 --> 40:38.021
Your new boss
is a real charmer.

40:38.104 --> 40:40.732
He's a fucking lunatic
is what he is.

40:43.151 --> 40:45.528
You should have been
chief, Bill.

40:46.863 --> 40:48.907
Serves me right.

40:48.990 --> 40:50.950
I should never have trusted
a snake like Buckley.

40:51.034 --> 40:52.035
I knew better!

40:52.118 --> 40:54.954
What about your case?

40:55.038 --> 40:58.458
Hop Wei
will go underground now.

40:58.541 --> 41:01.294
Back to square one.

41:01.378 --> 41:03.588
Don't beat yourself up
over this.

41:03.672 --> 41:06.466
That round-headed cunt had us
going through the front door,

41:06.549 --> 41:07.967
guns blazing.

41:09.386 --> 41:11.262
It was never going to work.

41:11.346 --> 41:12.847
Idiot.

41:12.931 --> 41:14.683
- Jesus Christ.
- Bill.

41:17.143 --> 41:20.480
Stone!
What the hell happened?

41:20.563 --> 41:23.316
We got jumped by a couple
of slants

41:23.400 --> 41:24.693
in an alley up the road.

41:24.776 --> 41:27.278
- Hop Wei?
- Oh, maybe.

41:27.362 --> 41:29.489
He wasn't wearing a suit.

41:29.572 --> 41:31.282
He who?
Give us something!

41:31.366 --> 41:33.451
Well, I don't fucking know!

41:33.535 --> 41:34.744
He was fast, though.

41:34.828 --> 41:36.955
Cut through the five of us
like we were nothing.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.125
He had a girl with him, too.

41:40.208 --> 41:43.044
They were hauling
something on a wagon.

41:44.421 --> 41:46.297
You think you'd recognize him
if you saw him again?

41:46.381 --> 41:48.258
I don't fucking know.

41:48.341 --> 41:50.343
It was dark.
They were chinks.

41:50.427 --> 41:52.429
What the fuck you want from me?

41:57.100 --> 41:58.184
Fucking hell.

41:58.268 --> 42:00.145
Okay, I need you to watch
over the plates

42:00.228 --> 42:02.814
for a little while
till I figure out what to do.

42:02.897 --> 42:05.400
You just beat up
a bunch of cops.

42:05.483 --> 42:06.735
Yeah, well,
they had it coming.

42:06.818 --> 42:08.278
And what--you think
that they're just

42:08.361 --> 42:09.529
going to forget about that?

42:09.612 --> 42:11.239
- Okay.
- They saw our faces.

42:11.322 --> 42:12.240
I didn't have a choice.

42:12.323 --> 42:13.533
That is not true.
We could have run.

42:13.616 --> 42:15.076
We could have done
anything, and I hit a cop.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.119
Okay.

42:16.202 --> 42:17.746
And I have never done
that before.

42:17.829 --> 42:19.164
- Listen to me.
- Don't you get it?

42:19.247 --> 42:20.623
They could have killed us!

42:20.707 --> 42:22.542
They didn't, and they
don't know anything.

42:22.625 --> 42:24.753
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

42:24.836 --> 42:27.797
I didn't sign up for this.

42:27.881 --> 42:30.633
- I know.
- This isn't what I wanted.

42:33.178 --> 42:34.846
You okay?

43:58.263 --> 43:59.723
Eliza.

44:02.225 --> 44:04.602
Where are Franny
and the others?

44:09.357 --> 44:10.734
Is something wrong?

44:15.030 --> 44:16.531
Is this the woman,
Mrs. Pendleton?

44:16.614 --> 44:17.657
Yes, Officer.

44:17.741 --> 44:19.367
I don't understand.
What's going on?

44:19.451 --> 44:21.286
You're under arrest
for criminal solicitation.

44:21.369 --> 44:23.288
What?
Of who?

44:23.371 --> 44:25.373
Eliza, what is this?

44:27.125 --> 44:31.129
I saw you yesterday
with Bernard.

44:31.212 --> 44:32.589
He told me everything.

44:32.672 --> 44:34.841
He touched me.

44:34.924 --> 44:37.093
I swear,
I would never do this to you.

44:37.177 --> 44:38.303
Ma'am?

44:40.972 --> 44:43.725
I took pity on you.

44:43.808 --> 44:46.478
- I let you into my home.
- I didn't do anything.

44:46.561 --> 44:49.814
We were discussing business,
and he just reached out and--

44:49.898 --> 44:52.233
Eliza, please,
you have to believe me!

44:55.570 --> 44:58.156
I hope they send you
back to China.

44:59.616 --> 45:01.326
Eliza!
Please!

45:01.409 --> 45:03.328
- Eliza, stop them!
- Come on.

45:03.411 --> 45:04.746
- Eliza!
- Let's go.
