Hey, this is Tom!

00:48.920 --> 00:50.500
I can't get
to the mirror right now.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.040
Leave a message
after the shriek.

00:53.330 --> 00:55.750
Hi, dude! It's me, Star.

00:55.750 --> 00:59.420
Anyway, just, uh, just wondering
what you were up to.

00:59.420 --> 01:01.920
Glossaryck. No! Down!

01:01.920 --> 01:03.500
Glossaryck!

01:03.500 --> 01:05.960
I thought-- I thought we could
meet up for that corn shake.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.790
So, give me a call.

01:18.460 --> 01:20.920
Hey, Pony Head-- Ooh!

01:20.920 --> 01:22.790
Sweat much

01:22.790 --> 01:25.460
What, me? Oh, I mean,
that's ridiculous!

01:25.460 --> 01:28.120
Uh... so...

01:28.120 --> 01:32.000
Anyway, I don't mean to dive
straight into hot goss,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.620
but Tom is acting
super weird.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.210
I thought things
were going great,

01:36.210 --> 01:38.210
and then all
of a sudden he--

01:38.210 --> 01:40.290
Are you okay?

01:40.290 --> 01:41.960
You're ruining the carpet.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.170
Okay, what is going on?

01:43.170 --> 01:44.420
What? Ha ha ha! Oh!

01:44.420 --> 01:45.920
You know, that is so funny

01:45.920 --> 01:47.960
that you would think
to say a thing such as that,

01:47.960 --> 01:49.830
because I most definitely
did not run into Tom,

01:49.830 --> 01:51.460
and definitely
he did not tell me

01:51.460 --> 01:54.210
to not tell you
what's going on.

01:54.210 --> 01:56.540
Pony, what's going on?

01:56.540 --> 01:59.420
Tom's getting a demoncism,
and he told me you can't know!

01:59.420 --> 02:01.960
Oh, no!
I'm unreliable.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.040
-Okay, I gotta go now!

02:05.040 --> 02:07.040
Oh, no, you don't!

02:08.880 --> 02:10.580
A demoncism?

02:10.580 --> 02:13.040
Aren't those,
like, the worst?

02:13.040 --> 02:14.580
Yeah!
They are!

02:14.580 --> 02:15.920
He's gonna ruin himself.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.080
We gotta stop him!

02:17.080 --> 02:19.380
His demoncism is happening,
like, right now!

02:19.380 --> 02:20.620
Wait, what

02:20.620 --> 02:22.460
Those things are,
like, super secret!

02:22.460 --> 02:24.500
Like, you gotta get invited.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.420
You do realize you were
not invited, right?

02:26.420 --> 02:28.670
I'm not trying to rub that
in your face, but...

02:28.670 --> 02:30.920
This is not helping.

02:30.920 --> 02:33.920
Look, we can go ask my ex.
He got demoncized.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.500
Which ex? Sorry.
That sounded way more judgy
that I wanted it to.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.250
Oh, Bessie, are you
talking right now?

02:39.250 --> 02:40.880
My big bad ex, Seahorse?

02:40.880 --> 02:43.710
You know, he's the one
who wrote that song about me.

02:43.710 --> 02:47.580
-Blech.

02:47.580 --> 02:51.040
Aw, yeah!
You're all trash! Aah!

02:51.040 --> 02:53.500
Aw! He was
such a romantic.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.710
Yeah, I-I tried that.

02:55.710 --> 02:57.830
What kind of dummy
do you think I am?

02:57.830 --> 02:58.960
This mirror's garbage!

02:58.960 --> 03:00.960
I'm sorry.
That's disappointing.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.460
Can I help you
find a replacement?

03:02.460 --> 03:05.460
No. No!
Get out!

03:05.460 --> 03:07.580
Thank you for choosing
Reflecticore.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.710
Have a mirror-ific day!

03:10.920 --> 03:12.500
Oh, what a nerd!

03:12.500 --> 03:14.330
Look how much water
he needs now!

03:14.330 --> 03:15.920
He's a seahorse, Pony.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.460
Yeah, well, he used to be
all dry, like a cool horse.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.960
Well, hello! Welcome
to Reflecticore Mobile.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.000
Can I help you find
a compact mirror?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.330
Mm, I'm just dropping by

03:24.330 --> 03:27.080
to, like, see how you've
been doing and stuff.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.460
And to ask
about the demoncism!

03:29.460 --> 03:31.290
Yeah, and that too.

03:31.290 --> 03:33.120
Please take your time
browsing our collection.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.580
Uh, what?

03:34.580 --> 03:35.580
Please take your time
browsing our--

03:35.580 --> 03:37.080
Yeah, I got that!

03:37.080 --> 03:39.500
Don't you even have
anything else to say to me?

03:39.500 --> 03:43.250
Can I interest you
in a three-year
interdimensional plan?

03:43.250 --> 03:46.460
Seahorse! Hello!
Wake up! It's me, Pony Head!

03:46.460 --> 03:49.460
Can't we even talk
like normal horsepersons?

03:49.460 --> 03:50.750
Well, you can talk
to anyone

03:50.750 --> 03:52.880
with Reflecticore
Mobile Technology.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.580
Okay, you know what?
You're broken, Seahorse.

03:54.580 --> 03:56.290
You're not the man
you used to be.

03:56.290 --> 03:59.120
That's disappointing.
Can I help you
find a replacement?

04:01.330 --> 04:03.330
It's so horrible!

04:03.330 --> 04:05.750
It's like he doesn't
even know me!

04:05.750 --> 04:07.670
And I'm the best person
anyone could know!

04:07.670 --> 04:09.040
I'm like a gift!

04:09.040 --> 04:11.960
Oh, Pony, I am so sorry.
I'll take care of it.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.040
A friend of ours
is going to get
a demoncism tonight,

04:14.040 --> 04:15.790
and we need to know
where it's happening.

04:15.790 --> 04:17.500
Can you give
us directions

04:17.500 --> 04:21.120
using Reflecticore
Mobile Technology?

04:21.120 --> 04:23.710
You can go anywhere

04:23.710 --> 04:25.420
with Reflecticore
Mobile Technology.

04:25.420 --> 04:28.210
We just want a map,
you corporate turd!

04:30.170 --> 04:31.620
I'll print a--

04:31.620 --> 04:33.460
I'll print a map now.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.170
You distract them.
I'll find Tom.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.960
Oh, yeah, I got you, girl.
Watch this.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.500
Excuse me!
Some last-minute announcement!

05:00.500 --> 05:03.750
So, as all of you know,
fall is coming up.

05:03.750 --> 05:07.080
Okay, so let's take a vote
on our new spooky robes.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.080
The first color
we're gonna vote on is maroon.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.500
Yea or nay?

05:11.500 --> 05:14.170
All for yea,
show your hands.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.880
O-Okay, so we
just not a hot ticket.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.540
That's fine.
We just have one for yea. Okay.

05:23.170 --> 05:25.790
All right, Tom, just what
do you think you're do

05:25.790 --> 05:29.080
-Oh, you look so nice!

05:29.080 --> 05:32.210
I'm here to stop you from making
a terrible, terrible mistake!

05:32.210 --> 05:34.210
If this is just another way
to get my attention, you--

05:34.210 --> 05:35.210
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.670
I don't know
what Pony told you,

05:36.670 --> 05:38.170
but it's
not what you think.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.250
I genuinely want this.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.210
What?

05:41.210 --> 05:43.620
I need to change.

05:43.620 --> 05:46.420
You're here being
the best princess
you can be,

05:46.420 --> 05:48.250
and it's
really inspiring.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.290
It's time for me
to be a better prince.

05:50.290 --> 05:52.880
Yeah, but whatever's
going on out there

05:52.880 --> 05:55.330
looks creepy
and dangerous.

05:55.330 --> 05:57.290
I'm the prince
of the underworld, okay?

05:57.290 --> 05:59.880
This is gonna be
an easy procedure
for a guy like me.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.120
In and out!

06:01.120 --> 06:02.380
All this stuff--

06:02.380 --> 06:04.580
the robed guys,
the skulls, the fire--

06:04.580 --> 06:06.080
it's just for show.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.750
So, you're just gonna zap
all your personality away

06:08.750 --> 06:10.250
so you can feel good
about yourself?

06:10.250 --> 06:13.120
No! I have problems,
and this is the only way

06:13.120 --> 06:16.330
to get rid of them!
Ow! See? Problems!

06:16.330 --> 06:18.540
You don't have to be
like this, Tom!

06:18.540 --> 06:20.960
Yeah, well, I've
already made up my mind,

06:20.960 --> 06:22.330
and you're not
gonna stop me.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.750
Fine, be that way!

06:23.750 --> 06:25.460
But I am not gonna stay here

06:25.460 --> 06:27.080
and watch you
do this to yourself.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.420
I didn't invite
you, anyway, so...

06:29.420 --> 06:31.080
-Great!
-Great!

06:31.080 --> 06:33.420
Gah! Of course!

06:33.420 --> 06:36.080
Also, who is bringing
what to the potluck, okay?

06:36.080 --> 06:37.960
Because I don't wanna see
nothing but chips.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.540
Come on,
we're outta here.

06:39.540 --> 06:41.750
All right, y'all, thank you
so much for your time!

06:53.750 --> 06:56.790
Brethren, this world
is in danger.

06:56.790 --> 06:59.290
There is a blight
that plagues it.

06:59.290 --> 07:01.080
Of course, we dream
of a world pure

07:01.080 --> 07:02.880
as a piece of sweet corn,

07:02.880 --> 07:05.330
but if one kernel
is infected,

07:05.330 --> 07:08.040
then the entire harvest
is at risk.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.170
Bring forth the son
of the blight.

07:11.750 --> 07:14.290
Son of the blight
has arrived!

07:14.290 --> 07:16.290
Thanks for coming out,
everybody.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.380
Whoa! Tight grip there.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.330
That fool
is so frustrating!

07:20.330 --> 07:22.080
I just wanna--
I just wanna--!

07:22.080 --> 07:24.080
Like, punch a tree
or something?

07:24.080 --> 07:25.790
I need to punch a tree!

07:25.790 --> 07:28.460
Girl! You know
I hate trees.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.830
Hey, hey! Thanks
for the ride, guys!

07:33.830 --> 07:35.830
Love
the massage table.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.790
Commence
the purification ritual.

07:46.330 --> 07:48.290
Okey-doke.

07:48.290 --> 07:51.040
Let the ceremony begin.

07:53.250 --> 07:57.040
[reciting
in foreign language]

08:03.290 --> 08:04.920
Oh. That's a nice touch.

08:04.920 --> 08:08.290
[reciting
in foreign language]

08:08.290 --> 08:10.580
[responding
in foreign language]

08:11.880 --> 08:14.250
Wow! Magic manacles.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.790
Magicals.

08:15.790 --> 08:17.120
The cauldron!

08:25.380 --> 08:27.000
Close your eyes.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.670
Okay, but no tickling!

08:31.880 --> 08:35.250
Hey. Hey, man, this is
real ceremonious and stuff,

08:35.250 --> 08:38.000
but it seems kind
of flim--

08:42.040 --> 08:43.250
It begins!

08:45.620 --> 08:46.920
Hold him!

08:53.710 --> 08:56.460
Aah!

09:02.420 --> 09:04.380
Harder! Harder!

09:04.380 --> 09:05.380
Yah!!!

09:07.500 --> 09:09.210
Dang, not that hard.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.120
What? That's weird.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.460
Something's wrong.

09:13.460 --> 09:14.580
Huh

09:18.460 --> 09:20.120
No!

09:20.120 --> 09:22.330
You're just gonna leave him
up there like that?

09:22.330 --> 09:24.000
He'll be fine.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.000
Magical mach ten blast!

09:42.880 --> 09:47.290
Tom, it's okay.
I'm-- I'm here.

09:47.290 --> 09:49.380
I'm right here.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.290
Star?

09:55.290 --> 09:57.960
Tom? Oh, my gosh,
are you okay?

09:57.960 --> 10:00.960
I'm...
in tremendous pain!

10:00.960 --> 10:03.120
Congratulations,
Master Lucitor.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.540
The procedure
was a success.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.120
Wow. Hard to believe
that one little demon

10:10.120 --> 10:12.580
was the source
of so much rage!

10:12.580 --> 10:15.120
What? No, no.
No, no, no.

10:15.120 --> 10:18.540
You still got thousands
of these little guys inside.

10:18.540 --> 10:21.710
We're gonna have to start you
on a 13-year plan.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.710
-Yeah, this is all gonna be

10:23.710 --> 10:26.460
a long and painful process
for all of us,

10:26.460 --> 10:28.290
but you were
such a good boy today,

10:28.290 --> 10:30.880
you can help yourself
to just one toy

10:30.880 --> 10:33.500
from the toy chest.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.920
Oh, no. No!
No, no!

10:35.920 --> 10:38.330
I'm gonna be
an evil demon forever!

10:38.330 --> 10:41.880
The important thing is that
you want to improve yourself!

10:41.880 --> 10:46.040
You can still do that
with a bunch of those
little guys inside of you.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.880
So, should we go again
next weekend?

10:52.580 --> 10:55.380
No. This is not worth it.

10:55.380 --> 10:57.040
Well, if you're
not coming back,

10:57.040 --> 11:00.540
you'd better make
that one toy count.

11:00.540 --> 11:02.920
So, still up
for that corn shake?

11:02.920 --> 11:05.000
