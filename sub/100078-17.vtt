00:06.757 --> 00:07.842
I'm a horrible person, aren't I?

00:07.925 --> 00:09.635
No. You're human.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.931
After inseminating the eggs,
none of them fertilized.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.684
You can start another cycle
in as little as six weeks.

00:16.767 --> 00:17.768
I'll do it.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.522
DANIEL: It must've been
an agonizing decision, turning in Hannah.

00:21.772 --> 00:24.358
-I think you did the right thing.
-Hannah, I was just trying to...

00:24.442 --> 00:28.404
Go and don't come back again.
Go! Go! Go!

00:29.405 --> 00:30.614
You're officially in remission.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.577
If you had one wish right now,
what would it be?

00:34.660 --> 00:35.995
To spend the rest of my life with you.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.664
You better not be playing with me,
because I'd marry you tomorrow.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.545
Finally.

00:44.628 --> 00:47.089
What's the big emergency?
I'm late for work.

00:47.173 --> 00:48.632
Sorry to inconvenience you, Dan,

00:48.716 --> 00:50.426
but your daughter
was sent home from school.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.261
-Suspended.
-What?

00:52.344 --> 00:53.804
For vaping.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.181
God, Suzie...

00:55.264 --> 00:58.184
Uh-uh-uh. No, no, no.
This one's your fault.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.351
How's it my fault?

00:59.435 --> 01:00.895
Because you've been neglecting her.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.189
I'm not the one who moved to Milwaukee.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.232
Okay, whatever you say.
Look, the point is,

01:05.316 --> 01:08.402
we've been back in Chicago almost a year,
and the past six months,

01:08.486 --> 01:10.488
you found excuses not to
see her on the weekends.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.907
You beg out of picking
her up after school.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.827
Yeah. Look, I...

01:16.911 --> 01:18.370
I've been a little distracted,

01:18.454 --> 01:22.291
you know, with CeCe and everything...

01:22.374 --> 01:25.044
I'm sorry your wife died, Dan. I am.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.340
But you have a 13-year-old daughter
who's very much alive.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.008
(SIGHS)

01:31.091 --> 01:33.427
-Is she in her room?
-Where else?

01:39.475 --> 01:42.978
It's Dad. Can I come in? I'm coming in.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.443
She took my phone.

01:49.527 --> 01:51.570
Vaping? Really?

01:52.196 --> 01:53.739
You know that's gonna kill you, right?

01:53.823 --> 01:55.115
You know I don't care, right?

01:56.158 --> 01:57.535
Get your schoolwork.
You're coming with me.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.954
-Where?
-Work.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.705
-The hospital?
-Yeah.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.791
It's Father-Daughter Day, and we're late.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.459
Come on, get your stuff.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.379
This is so stupid.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.631
Yeah. You can say that again.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.803
The Opal Room will let us start
setting up at noon.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.638
No problem. I can be there then.

02:17.721 --> 02:21.350
No, you're gonna be at the tailor's
trying on your tux.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.894
I can't believe you got
all this done in two weeks.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.312
It's handled.

02:25.396 --> 02:27.898
Maggie, I am your maid of honor.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.775
I should do something.

02:29.859 --> 02:30.943
Well...

02:33.362 --> 02:34.363
What?

02:35.906 --> 02:37.157
Nothing.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.326
The DJ will start setting up at 5:00.
Okay...

02:39.410 --> 02:40.870
-Mags, I'm sorry I gotta run.
-Okay.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.205
-Bride's dressing room at 6:00, okay?
-Yes, ma'am.

02:43.289 --> 02:44.582
All right.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.500
What'd you think about my playlist?

02:46.584 --> 02:48.794
You won't mind if I make changes, right?

02:50.880 --> 02:51.881
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

02:51.964 --> 02:54.133
Ms. Remus, hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.051
And you must be Mindi.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.220
-Hi.
-Hi.

02:58.304 --> 03:01.098
So, according to our chart,
you're no stranger to the ED.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.183
Mindi was premature.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.852
She's had a lot of health issues.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.979
I see. Respiratory distress syndrome.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.523
She has trouble breathing,
so, I keep her on oxygen.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.650
Mmm. Well, she's satting well.

03:11.734 --> 03:14.486
100%. What brought you in today?

03:14.570 --> 03:16.071
She isn't sleeping.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.907
It's even harder for her to breathe.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.035
And this morning,
she was just staring at a wall,

03:21.118 --> 03:22.745
which always happens
when she has a seizure.

03:23.329 --> 03:24.830
All right, well, why don't we take a look?

03:25.915 --> 03:28.876
-I'm gonna listen to your lungs, okay?
-Okay.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.128
Can you sit up a little bit for me?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.588
All right, now take a deep breath in.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.173
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

03:34.256 --> 03:36.467
Good. How about one more.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.010
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

03:38.093 --> 03:39.094
Great.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.180
All right. Well, her lungs sound good.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.598
She's alert.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.266
I'm not seeing any sign of seizures now.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.435
But we'll run some tests
to see what's going on.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.519
Let's get a chest X-ray,

03:47.603 --> 03:50.064
CBC, BMP, and let's
check her Keppra level.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.441
I just wanna make sure
she's on the appropriate dose.

03:53.108 --> 03:55.027
I'll be back when we have
some answers, okay?

03:56.737 --> 04:00.157
Dr. Manning. Do you know Dr. Strauss?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.826
I don't think we've actually met yet.
You're in peds, right?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.745
I specialize in medical child abuse.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.206
When Ms. Remus brought
her daughter in this morning,

04:07.289 --> 04:08.499
it set off an alert.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.583
An alert?

04:09.667 --> 04:11.752
She's been red-flagged
at several hospitals in the city.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.170
Why?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.715
We have every reason to believe
she's been abusing her daughter.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.891
I gotta stop by the cleaners after work,

04:25.975 --> 04:27.434

Maggie's wedding tonight.

-Yeah, I'm sure.

Anna, how many times have we
talked about your use of that word?

05:38.547 --> 05:41.383
And no, you don't get to see my patients.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.385
What's the point of me being here, Dad?

05:43.469 --> 05:44.470
What's the point?

05:45.596 --> 05:47.514
The point is, you've been suspended
and you gotta do your homework.

05:47.598 --> 05:48.932
That's the point.

Look, I gotta go.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.235

from a 10-year-old girl.

-Yep.

He is one of mine. Do not give me
any of that HIPAA crap.

But the bullet's in a dangerous spot.
We gotta get him to surgery.

07:29.074 --> 07:32.828
We have a possible case
of Munchausen by proxy.

07:32.911 --> 07:36.331
I believe Ms. Remus is either faking her
daughter's symptoms,

07:36.415 --> 07:38.667
or causing them to gain
attention for herself.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.545
I just don't think that's the case.

07:41.628 --> 07:42.713

07:42.796 --> 07:45.507
She seemed like a normal,
concerned parent.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.385
This little girl Mindi
certainly has been hospitalized a lot.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.512
Based on vague symptoms,

07:50.596 --> 07:53.265
which somehow health care
professionals don't see.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.391
Just hold on a second.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.728
I mean, Mindi was diagnosed
with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.855
When she was an infant.
She's four, now.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.399
Her mom's still bringing her in
for nebulizer treatments.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.776
Yeah, she's on a tremendous
amount of medication, I will say that.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.404
Which could be necessary,
given her history.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.325
Let's not argue the case
until we have more information.

if her test results

08:13.952 --> 08:16.705
support the symptoms
her mother is describing.

08:16.788 --> 08:20.959
And, Dr. Charles, you'll need
to evaluate Ms. Remus.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.587
If my suspicions are correct,

08:23.670 --> 08:26.632
then for Mindi's well-being,
we're gonna need to get DCFS involved.

-It's an abscess.
-What the hell from?

the abscess.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.834
(CONTINUES GROANING)

11:08.502 --> 11:09.669
We got you.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.135
(GROANING)

11:17.677 --> 11:19.054
Two milligrams morphine IV.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.889
-Right.
-April, what do I need to know?

11:20.972 --> 11:23.558
-I'm doing IVF.
-Okay. So, you're on hormones?

11:23.642 --> 11:25.769
-Uh-huh.
-I'm gonna palpate your belly.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.438
(SCREAMING)

11:30.065 --> 11:32.109
-Sorry.
-BP and heart rate are normal.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.653
Okay. Diffuse tenderness,
worse on the left side.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.279
CBC, BMP and HCG.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.032
April, this could be ovarian
torsion or a cyst.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.700
I'm gonna send you to gynae for
an ultrasound. Hank?

11:41.868 --> 11:42.994
Let's go.

11:43.078 --> 11:45.330
-I'll call gyne.
-Hold up.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.040
Page Dr. Asher, tell her

11:47.124 --> 11:49.292
I want her to personally
do this ultrasound on a colleague.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.461
Right.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.467
Honey, I'm so sorry.
I gotta dash right back out of here.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.845
There's something going on.
That's an antique.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.221
I'm doing geography.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.514
Yeah, you're funny.

12:02.597 --> 12:05.809
So, look, very limited selection.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.271
But they did have your favorite
barbecue potato chips,

12:09.354 --> 12:13.525
which are gonna go great with this
delicious tuna sandwich.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.695
Gee, Dad, what do you think would go
best with this?

12:18.697 --> 12:21.324
What, you went through my desk?

12:21.408 --> 12:23.743
I finished all my homework. What else was
I supposed to do?

12:23.827 --> 12:25.120
Honey, my desk is private.

12:25.203 --> 12:29.040
I mean, how would you feel if I went
through your backpack?

12:29.124 --> 12:30.333
You wouldn't find any alcohol in there.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.794
And you get on my case about vaping?
That's pretty hypocritical.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.421
Look, that was a gift.

12:34.504 --> 12:35.881
-Right.
-Hey, look.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.800
I'm an adult of legal drinking age,

12:38.884 --> 12:40.135
and you...

12:41.428 --> 12:42.596
You're a kid.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.764
-So, let's talk about vaping, shall we?
-Oh, my God.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.642
Every week, into this hospital,
we have kids your age

12:47.726 --> 12:50.520
-coming with their lungs destroyed.
-Here we go.

12:50.604 --> 12:51.897
I'm trying to have
a serious talk with you, young lady.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.482
And if you're gonna sass back
everything I say...

12:53.565 --> 12:55.817
We're not talking.
You're lecturing me.

12:55.901 --> 12:57.527
Well, maybe there's a reason for that.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.241
Look, just...

13:06.578 --> 13:08.455
Read a book, or something.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.500
Please.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.338
(DOOR CLOSES)

13:16.963 --> 13:18.298
(SIGHS)

13:19.174 --> 13:22.427
Your ultrasound showed bilateral enlarged
ovaries with good flow.

13:22.511 --> 13:25.305
There's no indication of torsion
or a hemorrhagic cyst.

13:25.388 --> 13:26.765
Then what?

13:26.848 --> 13:28.683
You do have some fluid in your abdomen.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.393
That, coupled with the pain and nausea,

13:30.477 --> 13:34.606
point to a mild case of OHSS,
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

13:34.689 --> 13:37.692
That's consistent with IVF,
from the hormones.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.697
I'm going to start you on some IV fluids
and albumin.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.074
Continue the pain meds.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.577
Usually, this resolves with time.
So, we'll wait and watch.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.038
-Thank you.
-Okay.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.381
Hannah?

14:02.634 --> 14:04.135
Glad to see you back.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.724
I know rehab wasn't easy...

14:09.808 --> 14:12.018
Let's just focus on your patient.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.943
So, you didn't find any other bullet
or shrapnel?

14:20.026 --> 14:22.112
Nothing metallic on this X-ray?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.364
No, ma'am, just today's GSW.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.116
But you're sure he was shot before?

14:26.199 --> 14:27.784
I don't see any other explanation.

14:27.867 --> 14:32.247
Well, any firearm injury
is a mandatory report.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.500
It's not in his history. And his partner
doesn't know anything about it.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.211
Look, he did save a little girl's life.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.839
I mean, the man's a hero.
I say we leave it alone.

14:40.922 --> 14:44.217
We can't leave it alone.
We have a legal obligation.

14:44.301 --> 14:48.597
But I agree, we don't wanna raise
any red flags if we don't have to.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.473
So, when the patient wakes up,

14:50.557 --> 14:52.642
-talk to him. Hopefully, there's...
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

14:52.726 --> 14:54.686
-Yes?
-Sorry to interrupt,

14:54.769 --> 14:57.897
but, Dr. Choi, you should know
April's not well.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.566
-What?
-Dr. Halstead's treating her.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.193
-SHARON: It's okay.
-MARCEL: Go, I got this.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.904
(APRIL BREATHING HEAVILY)

15:04.988 --> 15:07.032
She's tachycardic, sats down to 94.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.533
(BREATHLESSLY) I can't breathe.

15:08.617 --> 15:10.869
-Doris, cannula.
-Okay. Abdomen's distended.

15:10.952 --> 15:11.953
Bedside ultrasound.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.747
-April. What's going on?
-Ethan.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.291
OHSS.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.002
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.341
Ascitic fluid's irritating the diaphragm.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.051
That's why you're having
a hard time breathing.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.344
She needs paracentesis.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.678
-And a dose of albumin.
-HANNAH: Excuse me.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.930
-I'm treating this patient.
-You?

15:31.014 --> 15:34.851
Yes. Dr. Asher is treating her,
and she's already given April the albumin.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.521
Okay, April,

15:38.605 --> 15:41.107
I am going to numb the area.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.651
Baby, we're going to drain the fluid
from your belly, okay?

15:42.734 --> 15:44.611
Okay, you're not going to do anything.
Please go.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.112
I'm not going anywhere.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.658
Ethan, you know you shouldn't be
here for this.

15:49.741 --> 15:52.369
-Ethan, go. It's okay.
-No, no, no, no.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.662
I'll be okay.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.626
-We got it.
-HANNAH: Okay, April, ready?

16:01.711 --> 16:02.712
Okay.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.556
You're doing great.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.767
All right. We've got 10 ccs.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.852
That's it. Keep breathing.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.815
We've got 35, almost at 40.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.026
Okay.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.322
Good job, Dr. Asher.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.411
-Breathing's easier.
-Doris, keep pressure.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.578
DORIS: Mmm-hmm.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.039
April, I'll come check on you
in a bit, okay?

16:43.753 --> 16:46.631
Dr. Asher performed the paracentesis
and it went well.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.843
-April's stable.
-You can go in now.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.433
Hannah.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.148
You understand, I couldn't let you
keep treating patients.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.607
I had to make your addiction known.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.361
Publicly? So everyone knew?

17:08.445 --> 17:10.655
You have any idea
how humiliating it's been?

17:10.739 --> 17:13.783
There was no other way.
If I just turned you in, you'd deny it.

17:14.743 --> 17:16.536
I had to make sure they had evidence.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.246
No. What you did was a betrayal.

17:19.414 --> 17:22.250
You're an excellent doctor.
I believe in you.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.295
I wasn't about to let you
throw your life away.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.759
And if I had to do it over,
I'd do the same thing.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.483
Hey, guys. The sheers don't go there.

17:47.442 --> 17:51.279
They have to be at the head of the aisle
so, I can walk through them.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.246
-Hey, sweetie.
-Hey.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.248
How you doing, babe?

18:02.832 --> 18:04.626
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at the tailor's.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.961
Already been.
They're letting out the slacks.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.088
-Oh.
-So, what can I do to help?

18:09.172 --> 18:10.924
Nothing.

18:12.884 --> 18:15.553
-Ah, Palacio.
-I got your orchids.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.139
-There's a problem.
-What?

18:18.723 --> 18:21.267
-(GASPS)
-They were left on the tarmac at O'Hare.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.393
Frost damage.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.146
-They're ruined.
-Yeah.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.023
We can deal with this.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.149
(SIGHS)

18:28.233 --> 18:32.570
How about you pick out
a replacement, on us.

18:33.321 --> 18:38.618
Here, daisies.
Very popular wedding flower.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.078
Daisies.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.542
-How about...
-Babe, I've got this.

18:50.713 --> 18:53.591
So, I just reviewed
the EEG on Mindi Remus.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.969
I see no evidence she
had subclinical seizures

18:56.052 --> 18:58.388
-or any eleptiform activity.
-Are you sure?

18:58.471 --> 18:59.806
Am I sure?

18:59.889 --> 19:03.434
Only an incompetent would prescribe
anti-seizure medication for her.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.936
Anything else?

19:05.019 --> 19:06.563
No. Thank you, Dr. Abrams.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.899
Okay, so, are we ready
to turn this over to DCFS?

19:10.900 --> 19:12.527
You know, I'm not quite.

19:12.610 --> 19:13.778
Well, I am.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.655
What do you suggest?

19:15.738 --> 19:19.534
If we're accusing Ms. Remus of faking
her daughter's symptoms,

19:19.617 --> 19:23.538
why don't we just take Mindi off of oxygen
and see how she does?

19:24.122 --> 19:25.415
What do we have to lose, really?

19:28.126 --> 19:29.252
Are we in agreement?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.587
(SIGHS)

19:31.504 --> 19:32.630
All right, then.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.511
-Hey. He's awake?
-Yeah.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.680
-How's April?
-She's okay.

19:40.763 --> 19:41.973
Glad to hear it, man.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.313
Hey, John. Hey, man.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.275
Operation went well.
How're you feeling?

19:52.358 --> 19:54.569
-Okay...
-Good.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.739
So, we need to ask you some questions.
You up to it?

20:00.700 --> 20:04.287
Before today, have you ever been shot?

20:04.871 --> 20:07.999
Shot? No.

20:10.335 --> 20:14.088
We found two scars on your side.
How'd you get those?

20:16.132 --> 20:19.886
Yeah, when I was a kid,

20:21.846 --> 20:24.390
I was, you know, play sword fighting.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.976
I got jabbed.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.855
Officer Bell, I'm sorry,

20:30.939 --> 20:33.608
but that's just not consistent
with what we found.

20:33.691 --> 20:36.319
There was a piece of car seat foam
in your abdomen.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.821
So, what?

20:39.948 --> 20:42.742
We see that in people who've been shot
while sitting in a car.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.411
That didn't happen.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.539
Then, can you help us understand
how that foam could've gotten in there?

20:48.623 --> 20:52.418
Look, I don't care
what you think you found.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.837
I've never been shot.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.216
Right.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.886
Excuse us a moment.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.849
(SIGHS)

21:08.685 --> 21:10.103
Ms. Remus, this is Sharon Goodwin,

21:10.186 --> 21:12.271
our Executive Director
of Patient Services,

21:12.355 --> 21:13.564
and Dr. Strauss, a pediatrician.

21:14.899 --> 21:17.610
-Is something wrong?
-Please have a seat.

21:19.404 --> 21:23.408
So, Mindi's EEG came back normal,
which is a good thing.

21:23.491 --> 21:26.703
Problem is, it leaves us no closer
to a diagnosis.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.621
Which is why it would be
helpful for us

21:28.705 --> 21:30.790
to take Mindi off oxygen
and see how she does.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.166
But she needs it.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.002
SHARON: And that's what
we're going to find out.

21:34.085 --> 21:36.045
And if she has any trouble breathing,

21:36.129 --> 21:39.298
we will immediately put her back on it.

21:39.382 --> 21:41.676
But we need your permission.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.345
You do wanna help your daughter,
don't you?

21:44.429 --> 21:45.471
Of course I do.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.521
Okay.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.815
Mindi, honey,

21:55.898 --> 21:58.317
the doctors just need to test
something, okay?

22:00.361 --> 22:03.448
All right. We're gonna take this
out of your nose, okay?

22:03.531 --> 22:06.743
All right, you ready?
Here you go.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.411
You're gonna be all right.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.371
There you go. You okay?

22:12.081 --> 22:13.583
Is it hard to breathe?

22:16.753 --> 22:19.630
Sats are still at 100%.

22:23.051 --> 22:24.260
I don't understand.

22:25.428 --> 22:27.847
This is like a miracle.
How could this happen?

22:28.931 --> 22:31.476
Do you mind, could we step outside
and chat for a bit?

22:33.019 --> 22:36.105
Mindi, Mommy'll be right back, okay?

22:42.779 --> 22:45.323
Ms. Remus, are you familiar
with a condition

22:45.406 --> 22:47.784
called Munchausen by proxy?

22:50.119 --> 22:54.665
You think I'm crazy.
You think I'm making my daughter sick?

22:54.749 --> 22:58.711
Other hospitals reported that
Mindi's symptoms don't seem to present

22:58.795 --> 23:00.588
when she's in the emergency room.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.840
-Other hospitals?
-Yes.

23:03.508 --> 23:06.719
You've known about this all day,
and you didn't say anything?

23:06.803 --> 23:08.888
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, my God.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.726
You're trying to take
my child away from me.

23:13.810 --> 23:16.813
Ms. Remus, our main interest
is Mindi's welfare.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.023
No, no, you can't take her.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.942
You cannot take my little girl from me!

23:21.025 --> 23:23.820
-DANIEL: Ms. Remus.
-CAROL: No, no, no...

23:23.903 --> 23:25.321
We really should have this
conversation outside.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.115
-You can't take her!
-DANIEL: No, Ms. Remus, it's very...

23:27.198 --> 23:29.283
CAROL: You can't take her!
I am not crazy!

23:29.367 --> 23:31.369
-Dad?
-No, you can't take her from me.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.162
-Dad!
-Anna.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.331
Give me a minute.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.500
Could that really happen?

23:37.583 --> 23:38.918
-Could they really take her daughter away?
-Honey,

23:39.001 --> 23:41.129
what are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here, sweetie.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.589
-CAROL: I love her.
-NATALIE: I know you love her...

23:43.673 --> 23:46.384
CAROL: You are not
taking her away from me!

23:50.596 --> 23:54.142
(CRYING) Honey, I am so sorry
that you had to see that.

23:54.225 --> 23:57.645
But what was going on there
was that that woman,

23:58.062 --> 24:02.441
she may have an illness

24:02.525 --> 24:05.820
that causes her to not be a very good mom.

24:09.532 --> 24:12.034
Dad, are they gonna separate you from me?

24:12.118 --> 24:14.412
What? Who?

24:15.788 --> 24:18.249
Those people, like downstairs.
(SNIFFLES)

24:19.667 --> 24:24.755
No. No, nobody's gonna separate us.

24:24.839 --> 24:26.257
Why would you ask that?

24:27.717 --> 24:30.011
Because you haven't been a very good dad.

24:33.556 --> 24:36.559
I mean, it's like
you just forgot about me.

24:36.642 --> 24:41.606
No. No, no, no.
Not for a second. I didn't...

24:41.689 --> 24:44.192
You did, but I'm not mad.

24:44.275 --> 24:47.028
I don't care.
I don't want you to go away.

24:47.111 --> 24:51.407
No, sweetie, I'm not going anywhere.
It's not gonna happen.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.410
-You promise?
-I promise.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.249
What?

25:02.001 --> 25:07.215
It's just that you know I do,
I love you so much,

25:07.882 --> 25:10.676
and I feel so bad.

25:12.345 --> 25:15.097
-It's okay.
-No, it's not okay.

25:15.181 --> 25:18.392
You're right. I have not been
a very good dad.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.563
I haven't been around.

25:22.647 --> 25:24.482
Well, that's because CeCe died.

25:25.066 --> 25:28.527
Yeah, but you know what?
That's not an excuse.

25:30.780 --> 25:34.242
You're my daughter.
You're my little baby girl.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.369
And...

25:38.829 --> 25:40.164
I'm really sorry.

25:42.416 --> 25:43.960
And I promise I'm gonna...

25:44.043 --> 25:47.588
I'm gonna do better. Okay?

25:48.256 --> 25:49.632
Okay.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.773
Your fellow officers
would like to come in.

26:06.357 --> 26:07.566
Did you say something to them?

26:07.650 --> 26:09.610
No. No, we haven't.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.948
Look, John, I'm in the Navy.

26:14.782 --> 26:19.036
And it's been my experience
that cops and military, we're a lot alike.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.497
Profound sense of duty.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.666
But I gotta tell you, man.

26:24.583 --> 26:28.879
If something did happen in your past,
you need to own up to it.

26:31.424 --> 26:35.594
I'm not a military man,
but my pops used to say,

26:36.137 --> 26:37.930
a lie can poison a man's life.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.350
(SIGHS)

26:52.778 --> 26:54.405
What do you think about the pants?

26:54.488 --> 26:57.199
What's that smell?
What's going on?

26:57.283 --> 26:58.951
The sewer's backed up.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.539
-Can you fix it?
-We've got raw sewage

27:03.622 --> 27:06.208
coming up from the drains.
Kitchen's not usable.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.377
-We have to close.
-Close?

27:08.461 --> 27:11.797
I'm very sorry.
We can reschedule,

27:11.881 --> 27:12.965
help you find another venue...

27:17.720 --> 27:19.680
(SIGHS) Ben...

27:21.182 --> 27:22.391
It'll be okay.

27:22.475 --> 27:25.061
But it's always been my dream
to get married here.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.854
We'll figure something out.

27:29.482 --> 27:34.320
I'm not gonna give up.
I can do this.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.991
Where else can we have it?

27:42.536 --> 27:45.331
The Riverwalk,
we could rent a tent...

27:45.414 --> 27:48.793
It's March.
Maggie, let me help you out here.

27:48.876 --> 27:51.754
-Ben, don't distract me.
-Stop it, all right? Stop.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.882
You're acting like someone in remission.

27:55.466 --> 27:56.634
What?

27:57.593 --> 28:00.679
Cancer, that's what this is about.

28:02.181 --> 28:05.559
You just went through something
that made you feel helpless.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.269
And you never wanna feel that way again.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.564
Believe me, I know.

28:10.648 --> 28:13.484
But no matter how hard you try,
you can't control everything.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.779
-But it's all ruined.
-Mmm-mmm.

28:19.073 --> 28:21.283
You have a partner now.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.788
What's called in marriage a helpmate.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.208
And that helpmate is gonna
do his job and help you.

28:41.178 --> 28:43.472
-Sorry about that.
-Is everything okay?

28:44.056 --> 28:46.267
-Yeah. Yes, it is, thanks.
-Good.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.852
Once you're finished evaluating her,

28:47.935 --> 28:49.562
we're supposed to meet
in Goodwin's office.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.022
I so wanted to believe her.

28:59.572 --> 29:03.325
When I was pregnant,
they told me that I would lose her

29:03.409 --> 29:05.995
if I didn't stay in bed,
so, I did for two months.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.207
But still, she came at 24 weeks.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.918
Would you mind telling me a bit

29:13.002 --> 29:15.212
about what Mindi's birth
was like for you?

29:16.422 --> 29:17.715
Terrible.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.385
I was so scared.

29:21.469 --> 29:23.846
And there was so much blood.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.931
And then she wasn't breathing.

29:27.475 --> 29:31.604
They took her away from me
and they put all these tubes in her.

29:33.981 --> 29:37.193
I see the faces of the doctors,
and I hear the machines.

29:42.072 --> 29:43.657
And I think my baby is dying.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.913
Even now, she sleeps next to me in bed.

29:50.331 --> 29:55.085
And I listen all night to make sure
she's still breathing.

29:55.169 --> 29:59.507
But you're getting some rest, aren't you?

29:59.590 --> 30:01.091
When do you sleep?

30:02.426 --> 30:03.969
I don't.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.515
(CAROL SOBBING)

30:07.598 --> 30:09.725
Okay. Everything is looking great, April,

30:09.808 --> 30:12.686
but you will need to follow up
with your REI about continuing IVF.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.980
I will, thank you.

30:15.564 --> 30:16.774
I'm glad you're back.

30:19.068 --> 30:21.195
I'll go get your discharge started.

30:23.948 --> 30:27.159
You're gonna be okay,
but we need to change your meds.

30:29.537 --> 30:31.288
When the last harvest failed,

30:31.372 --> 30:35.167
I wanted to make sure
that the next one didn't.

30:35.709 --> 30:39.088
So, I doubled up on my hormone meds.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.340
-(GASPS)
-I did it to myself.

30:41.423 --> 30:42.716
April...

30:42.800 --> 30:44.802
-You want a baby.
-We both want a baby.

30:44.885 --> 30:47.555
But not at the expense
of your health. Never.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.976
Look, it's okay. It's okay.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.603
I just wanted to make up for...

30:54.687 --> 30:57.147
You have nothing to make up for.

30:57.982 --> 30:59.275
(SOFTLY) I do.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.734
What are you talking about?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.654
Crockett.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.491
Crockett?

31:10.744 --> 31:14.873
The night that you left on deployment...

31:17.835 --> 31:19.211
I kissed him.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.424
I'm sorry.

31:25.884 --> 31:29.305
Wait. It wasn't his fault. It was mine.
He had nothing to do with it.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.432
Nothing? Nothing to do with it...

31:31.515 --> 31:34.143
Ethan? Ethan...

31:36.312 --> 31:38.689
April? Really?

31:38.772 --> 31:42.026
Huh? All this time,
acting like friends. Huh?

31:42.109 --> 31:44.862
Come on! Come on, friend!
Let's be friends! Come on!

31:44.945 --> 31:46.488
-Hey! Hey!
-Come on!

31:46.572 --> 31:48.407
-Back up.
-DINA: Dr. Marcel!

31:49.742 --> 31:51.452
The patient wants to see you.

31:59.710 --> 32:00.878
Go.

32:04.548 --> 32:05.966
Officer, what do you need?

32:09.178 --> 32:10.971
They think I'm a hero.

32:12.598 --> 32:13.599
I'm not.

32:17.561 --> 32:20.731
You were right.
I can't go on living a lie.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.361
I was 17.

32:26.236 --> 32:27.738
A real knucklehead.

32:30.324 --> 32:32.284
Friend had a gun,

32:32.368 --> 32:34.870
thought it'd be cool to knock off
a liquor store.

32:36.038 --> 32:39.333
Trouble was,
the owner also had a gun.

32:41.335 --> 32:46.256
Shot my friend,
shot me when I was in the car,

32:47.132 --> 32:48.384
trying to get away.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.429
My friend died.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.558
But I lived.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.146
I had to believe it was for a reason.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.065
Turn my life around,

33:04.775 --> 33:06.235
make amends.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.491
Appreciate what it took
for you to tell us this.

33:19.206 --> 33:20.708
Since the gunshot wound

33:21.875 --> 33:23.293
was never reported,

33:24.545 --> 33:26.505
-you know that we have to...
-No.

33:28.465 --> 33:29.591
Let me.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.053
I will.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.476

(DOOR OPENS)

33:53.907 --> 33:54.950
So, are we agreed?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.327
DCFS will take custody of Mindi Remus?

33:57.411 --> 33:58.579
No, we're not.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.165
-We are not agreed.
-What?

34:01.248 --> 34:02.541
Why not?

34:02.624 --> 34:05.335
Carol Remus is suffering
from a mental illness,

34:05.419 --> 34:10.466
which happens to be easily misinterpreted
as Munchausen by proxy, but it's not.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.468
I think she's suffering from PTSD.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.261
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.305
Oh, come on. From what?

34:16.388 --> 34:20.809
From the experience of giving birth
to an extremely premature baby.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.686
And of watching that baby almost die.

34:22.770 --> 34:28.066
No. Mindi is clearly not suffering from
any of the conditions that Mom claims.

34:28.150 --> 34:31.236
PTSD leads to hyper-vigilance,
in this case,

34:31.320 --> 34:33.697
a mother's constant worry
about her daughter's health.

34:33.781 --> 34:38.494
This would cause Ms. Remus
to misinterpret Mindi's symptoms,

34:38.577 --> 34:40.287
even blow them wildly out of proportion.

34:40.370 --> 34:41.455
What about the little girl?

34:42.539 --> 34:43.582
What about what she needs?

34:43.665 --> 34:46.084
What's best for Mindi
is to remain with a mother who loves her.

34:47.169 --> 34:48.170
You're wrong.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.840
Ms. Goodwin?

34:51.924 --> 34:54.718
I'm going to stand with Dr. Charles.

35:00.724 --> 35:04.478
When that little girl comes back in here
severely injured, and she will,

just talked my way out of it.

35:31.964 --> 35:36.552
Yeah, I was in too deep.
Just total self-denial.

Every day had just become about
getting my next fix.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.315
what you did was what I needed.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.861
It has not been easy,

Ms. Goodwin, it was my fault.

I take full responsibility
for what happened.

April and I, we've been trying
to have a baby.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.630
And I guess I got obsessed
with that.

36:56.924 --> 36:58.508
Didn't see there were problems.

37:01.303 --> 37:05.182
I can understand your wanting to have
a baby, Dr. Choi.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.225

life into the world.

Great job.

40:42.858 --> 40:45.152
So what's it gonna be?
Me or the TV

40:45.235 --> 40:47.404
Now let me take time to set
your mind and your body free
