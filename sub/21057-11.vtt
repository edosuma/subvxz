00:36.640 --> 00:41.909
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:42.979 --> 00:44.549
I will get my hands dirty for you.

00:45.620 --> 00:47.260
I'll do what you can't,

00:48.190 --> 00:49.190
A Jin.

00:49.460 --> 00:51.529
The lady who bought my painting today is married...

00:51.729 --> 00:53.930
to the CEO of the biggest natto company in Japan.

00:54.029 --> 00:55.460
I heard that she has a keen eye for art.

00:55.529 --> 00:57.830
She said this person she hates is giving her murderous thoughts...

00:57.830 --> 00:59.299
She told me to hurt her.

00:59.299 --> 01:00.470
He's putting on a show, Father.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.440
I bet he's colluding with this woman.

01:03.510 --> 01:06.270
Shut up! How dare you spew such nonsense?

01:06.370 --> 01:07.579
I can easily tell the police that...

01:07.579 --> 01:10.410
the bullet wasn't misfired and that he actually tried to kill me.

01:10.579 --> 01:13.449
I've been thinking about going back to school.

01:13.520 --> 01:14.520
I'm wondering if you can create...

01:14.680 --> 01:17.650
a position for me even if it's nothing official or proper.

01:18.050 --> 01:20.790
I'm raising an ill child. Are you saying I should have an affair...

01:21.990 --> 01:23.059
just like what his father is doing?

01:23.160 --> 01:24.630
I'm pregnant!

01:24.960 --> 01:27.800
Whose kid, is it? We'll find out when the it's born.

01:28.499 --> 01:30.529
Why did you decide to drop the charges all of a sudden?

01:30.999 --> 01:33.699
A Jin bought it for me, but the house is under my name.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.999
I no longer consider him my husband,

01:36.839 --> 01:38.439
but Ji Hu still needs a dad.

01:38.910 --> 01:39.910
A Jin!

01:39.910 --> 01:41.579
Who are you going to live with at that house?

01:41.740 --> 01:42.839
How could you?

01:43.079 --> 01:45.109
Did you faint because of what I said earlier?

01:45.410 --> 01:48.749
Try to be cool about it, okay? Just accept it.

01:49.749 --> 01:50.790
Jae Seok.

01:51.919 --> 01:54.620
You're out of my life for good now.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.569
An attempt to ascend to the upper class by a lower-class who's...

02:37.900 --> 02:39.529
comparable to a pig that hates the blue tag on its back is...

02:40.339 --> 02:43.309
just as painful as a salmon migrating against the current...

02:43.309 --> 02:44.539
to lay its eggs.

02:46.110 --> 02:47.580
After that pain,

02:48.180 --> 02:50.210
does the salmon know it will die?

02:52.349 --> 02:55.249
If it knew, it probably wouldn't have...

02:56.719 --> 02:58.490
swam against the current.

03:19.170 --> 03:21.110
Where are we going right now?

03:21.809 --> 03:23.140
I said you shouldn't leave the hospital.

03:24.050 --> 03:25.080
I want you to take on a case.

03:25.909 --> 03:26.920
Pardon?

03:28.349 --> 03:29.379
A divorce case.

03:55.839 --> 03:56.849
Hello.

04:00.550 --> 04:04.150
Let me see that patterned bag and that yellow bag.

04:04.349 --> 04:05.349
Sure, Ma'am.

04:31.749 --> 04:35.879
- Ma'am, they both suit you so well. - Really?

04:36.850 --> 04:39.790
We carry a variety of colors so why don't you browse around?

04:44.759 --> 04:47.759
I'll just take one in every color.

04:49.530 --> 04:50.530
Pardon?

05:01.110 --> 05:02.680
How would you like to pay?

05:03.949 --> 05:04.980
A lump-sum payment.

05:06.550 --> 05:07.879
I'll complete the transaction.

05:24.230 --> 05:25.999
Get out of this house.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.509
What are you looking at? I told you to leave.

05:34.610 --> 05:35.639
Where would I go?

05:36.240 --> 05:37.780
I told you to get out of this house!

05:38.749 --> 05:39.780
Are you mad?

05:40.319 --> 05:41.749
What? Mad?

05:42.680 --> 05:44.850
Ji Hu's still sleeping. Quiet down.

05:46.319 --> 05:47.360
Let's get divorced.

05:47.490 --> 05:50.660
Hey! You shouldn't talk about a divorce as if it's nothing.

05:50.759 --> 05:51.759
Is marriage a joke to you?

05:52.259 --> 05:54.730
Look who's talking. You must be crazy.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.800
You've lost your mind.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.199
That's my question. Is marriage a joke to you?

05:58.199 --> 06:01.100
A Jin, you're starting to lose your refinement these days.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.139
Shut your mouth!

06:03.540 --> 06:06.410
I'm going to raise Ji Hu and we'll split the assets.

06:06.780 --> 06:10.009
And, the house you two are living in now is mine.

06:10.879 --> 06:13.420
Ji Hu and I have to move in there, so you two must move out right away.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.850
A divorce? Who said we can get a divorce?

06:15.920 --> 06:17.449
Who else? Me!

06:18.790 --> 06:22.189
I don't want our Ji Hu to live with a man like you.

06:22.889 --> 06:24.059
I also worry...

06:24.829 --> 06:27.699
that you'll raise her to have distorted values of men.

06:27.930 --> 06:31.430
And above all else, you have no right to be a father.

06:32.199 --> 06:34.439
A Jin, I love you.

06:34.999 --> 06:36.910
And I can't live without Ji Hu.

06:36.910 --> 06:39.639
No! You're not allowed to love me...

06:39.840 --> 06:41.139
and you have to live without Ji Hu.

06:41.439 --> 06:43.579
Why? You're...

06:44.610 --> 06:45.980
a total scumbag. That's why.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.449
A Jin!

06:47.449 --> 06:49.120
I'll file a lawsuit if you don't consent.

06:49.889 --> 06:51.519
Let's not drag it out and end it quickly.

06:51.790 --> 06:54.090
No, I'm not getting a divorce. I won't do it!

06:55.990 --> 06:57.329
You're unbelievable!

06:58.629 --> 07:01.259
Then hire a lawyer. I'll file a lawsuit.

07:01.399 --> 07:03.430
- A Jin... - Don't touch me!

07:13.009 --> 07:14.009
Good job.

07:28.319 --> 07:29.790
Son?

07:30.629 --> 07:33.399
Let's go inside, okay? You must be cold. Let's go, okay?

07:33.899 --> 07:36.199
If you ask me how my life has been,

07:37.300 --> 07:39.629
I'd tell you that half of my life was sad.

07:40.899 --> 07:41.899
Joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.040
I would say my life was overwhelmingly filled...

07:46.340 --> 07:47.540
with anger and sorrow.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.550
Is Dad not riding his bike these days?

07:57.319 --> 07:58.949
No, he's not.

08:00.860 --> 08:02.519
Where did he go today?

08:02.590 --> 08:04.660
Is he working on a Saturday?

08:07.059 --> 08:08.660
- Ji Hu. - Yes?

08:09.730 --> 08:12.129
Should we move to a new place closer to your school?

08:12.730 --> 08:14.240
You said we'll move when I'm in grade four.

08:14.939 --> 08:16.639
Let's go a little earlier.

08:17.139 --> 08:18.170
Okay, sounds good.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.309
But it's possible...

08:21.209 --> 08:23.139
that we'll move, just the two of us.

08:24.249 --> 08:25.249
Why?

08:26.879 --> 08:29.379
Your dad might have to live here.

08:32.490 --> 08:33.490
Ji Hu?

08:33.919 --> 08:37.190
Mom, you're going to split up with Dad, aren't you?

08:37.860 --> 08:39.330
No, it's not like that.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.499
Your dad has to resolve Grandpa's company issue and...

08:42.499 --> 08:44.499
Mom, I like...

08:45.230 --> 08:46.740
living together...

08:47.100 --> 08:49.600
with both you and Dad,

08:50.769 --> 08:53.909
but if that's difficult, I'll understand.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.610
Ji Hu.

08:59.710 --> 09:00.919
I heard that, at times,

09:01.549 --> 09:04.320
kids are unable to understand the feelings of grownups.

09:05.350 --> 09:08.759
I won't throw a tantrum because you I love you and Dad.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.999
Mom, this is...

09:19.830 --> 09:21.370
a part of my life.

09:23.169 --> 09:24.840
I'll accept it.

09:28.679 --> 09:29.879
"A part of life."

09:30.679 --> 09:33.049
The parts come together like a puzzle,

09:33.549 --> 09:34.820
and form one whole picture.

09:36.419 --> 09:38.889
Life is usually an incomplete and poor-quality work...

09:38.889 --> 09:40.759
that originally aimed for a complete masterpiece.

09:41.460 --> 09:44.730
But at times, there are really lucky people...

09:45.230 --> 09:47.399
whose poor-quality lives transform into a masterpiece.

09:48.929 --> 09:51.970
Although, it's uncertain if that luck will remain lucky...

09:52.370 --> 09:53.740
until the very end.

09:54.899 --> 09:56.740
How should we accept the payment?

09:57.470 --> 10:00.009
Postpone paying Seong hui for the time being...

10:00.210 --> 10:01.509
until A Jin goes to see her.

10:02.139 --> 10:03.179
Pardon?

10:03.279 --> 10:05.909
Please delay my payment for Seong Hui Yun's artwork.

10:06.409 --> 10:08.620
- Why? - I will ask for the painting...

10:09.049 --> 10:10.389
instead of my husband.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.289
A Jin called me this morning,

10:15.460 --> 10:18.029
saying she'll file to seize the payment.

10:18.529 --> 10:20.529
It's not a difficult request, so we should cooperate.

10:21.399 --> 10:24.330
Oh my, why? It's not like it's her commission.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.169
She said it's a premium for her husband.

10:26.299 --> 10:28.600
Isn't A Jin really attractive?

10:29.200 --> 10:31.610
Her method of problem-solving is too sexy.

10:37.009 --> 10:39.009
Jin Hee, I'm so sorry.

10:40.279 --> 10:42.279
- That's okay. - Jae Sik didn't come to work...

10:42.279 --> 10:43.990
because he doesn't have classes today.

10:44.049 --> 10:45.919
That's okay. I just have to finish these, right?

10:45.990 --> 10:47.820
Yes, I know I'm being shameless, but I'll trust you with it.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.220
Okay, don't worry.

10:52.529 --> 10:54.330
Are you finished? Bye!

10:55.529 --> 10:57.429
Ji Hu! Gosh.

10:57.499 --> 10:59.899
I'll drive the other kids so you can leave with Ji Hu.

11:03.470 --> 11:06.269
Oh, don't do this. I'll get in trouble if A Jin finds out.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.710
What do you mean? It's not much.

11:09.310 --> 11:11.450
Buy Ji Hu a sandwich with this.

11:12.450 --> 11:13.450
I shouldn't accept this.

11:13.779 --> 11:18.749
If I knew a good person like you, I'd want to be close with them.

11:20.019 --> 11:21.519
A Jin is so lucky.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.889
Thank you, Ms. Baek.

11:24.389 --> 11:26.960
If you ever need me to fill in again, give me a call.

11:27.399 --> 11:29.730
I appreciate the thought. Get home safely.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.830
Okay. Goodbye.

11:33.399 --> 11:34.399
Yes.

11:41.110 --> 11:42.110
Here.

11:43.879 --> 11:45.810
- Are you all right? - What do you mean?

11:46.179 --> 11:47.220
Your physical health.

11:47.519 --> 11:49.320
Yes, I'm fine.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.350
Are you okay?

11:52.419 --> 11:55.519
- What do you mean this time? - Your heart. Doesn't it hurt?

11:59.060 --> 12:00.100
It hurts.

12:00.830 --> 12:01.830
That's all I wanted to hear.

12:02.529 --> 12:03.730
What do you mean by that?

12:03.870 --> 12:06.070
If you hurt too much, you don't even realize you're hurting.

12:06.529 --> 12:09.440
This means you're more than capable of recovering.

12:12.940 --> 12:15.740
I came here as your client who wants to file for a divorce.

12:16.039 --> 12:19.249
I know. That's why you made me come to work on a Saturday.

12:20.450 --> 12:22.419
I'll speak as your lawyer from now on.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.090
Okay.

12:24.090 --> 12:25.350
What's your reason for this divorce?

12:26.019 --> 12:27.019
My husband's affair.

12:27.490 --> 12:29.190
You have physical evidence, right?

12:30.590 --> 12:31.590
Yes.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.700
Is that woman someone you know?

12:36.060 --> 12:39.399
She's an artist I've known and my daughter's art teacher.

12:40.769 --> 12:42.470
They're saying they love each other.

12:44.009 --> 12:47.379
In such circumstances, the husband usually asks for a divorce.

12:47.980 --> 12:49.440
Didn't your husband ask you for a divorce?

12:50.149 --> 12:54.120
No, what my husband wants is coexistence.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.249
He wants me to accept his relationship with that woman...

12:59.919 --> 13:01.659
while maintaining our marriage.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.929
How long has his affair lasted for?

13:07.799 --> 13:09.330
I think it's been over a month.

13:09.799 --> 13:11.070
Are you really going to get divorced?

13:11.929 --> 13:14.169
You have no intention of living with it, right?

13:14.570 --> 13:16.570
- What did you say? - Don't misunderstand.

13:16.810 --> 13:17.840
I didn't mean it like that.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.240
The truth is, there are many who calculate their profit and loss...

13:22.409 --> 13:24.980
and put up with their husband,

13:25.210 --> 13:26.820
even if they've cheated.

13:27.249 --> 13:29.889
The divorce process is very agonizing.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.460
From division of property to child custody,

13:34.389 --> 13:36.120
it'll be a gruesome battle.

13:36.860 --> 13:39.029
My husband is already living with that woman.

13:39.259 --> 13:42.159
And he's being too confident about it for a man with a family.

13:42.759 --> 13:45.129
I should make hold him responsible for our failed marriage.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.370
In a legal sense, as well.

13:47.299 --> 13:50.370
But, due to the abolition of punishment for adultery,

13:50.509 --> 13:54.409
you know he can't be punished for having a concubine, right?

13:55.210 --> 13:57.850
So this is a civil case, not a criminal case.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.720
I guess the law feels very differently about this.

14:05.820 --> 14:07.620
What is your husband's...

14:08.620 --> 14:10.330
What is your husband's name?

14:11.560 --> 14:12.590
Jae Seok Ahn.

14:14.529 --> 14:16.029
Ahn Jae Seok's affair is certainly...

14:16.159 --> 14:18.799
an important reason for your failed marriage,

14:19.370 --> 14:20.940
but there's an even bigger fault.

14:23.139 --> 14:25.470
He tried to push his own values onto the other person.

14:25.610 --> 14:28.940
That could become the decisive reason for this divorce.

14:30.009 --> 14:32.950
He tried to push you to accept that he has a concubine,

14:33.149 --> 14:35.820
although you possess completely different values.

14:37.019 --> 14:38.090
This is his fault.

14:42.490 --> 14:43.889
There's one more problem.

14:46.629 --> 14:47.899
She said she'll file for a divorce.

14:50.470 --> 14:52.700
Are you saying your wife found out about this house?

14:52.970 --> 14:54.340
That's what I'm telling you.

14:54.870 --> 14:57.210
She said she'll divorce me and live in this house with our daughter.

14:57.340 --> 14:58.340
Then what about me?

14:58.970 --> 15:01.279
You and I would have to live where A Jin lives right now.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.509
So, she's telling us to live in Father's annex.

15:04.580 --> 15:07.220
That's nonsense. I won't take a step outside this house!

15:11.820 --> 15:14.120
Honey, whose name is this house under?

15:14.960 --> 15:15.960
Whose else? Mine.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.029
Let's put it under my name.

15:18.490 --> 15:20.259
- What? - Only then,

15:20.259 --> 15:22.499
your wife won't be able to say that she'll move in here.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.899
That's not what's important here!

15:24.970 --> 15:27.440
Honey, you don't want to get a divorce, do you?

15:27.570 --> 15:29.799
Then, you have to put this house under my name.

15:30.009 --> 15:32.370
Then she won't have anything to gain, so she won't get divorced.

15:32.570 --> 15:35.009
That woman wants to get a divorce just so she can have this house.

15:35.740 --> 15:37.879
I don't want to get a divorce. I won't do it!

15:39.850 --> 15:41.749
That's why I'm telling you to put it under my name!

15:50.789 --> 15:52.730
Ms. Park would like to see you.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.440
You'll leave as soon as Un Gyu takes his college entrance exam.

16:05.070 --> 16:08.940
I asked your father to consider your circumstances one more time.

16:10.409 --> 16:12.749
I'm so thankful. How should I repay you?

16:14.519 --> 16:17.090
Well, it's not like we're strangers, right?

16:18.220 --> 16:19.249
About that man...

16:19.889 --> 16:22.519
The man I instigated to kill you.

16:23.929 --> 16:25.460
Tell me his phone number.

16:26.460 --> 16:29.730
Shouldn't you know about him better than I do?

16:30.499 --> 16:31.570
That's right.

16:33.029 --> 16:34.070
It slipped my mind.

16:35.399 --> 16:37.310
I accidentally erased his number.

16:37.970 --> 16:39.340
I would like it back.

16:39.470 --> 16:41.909
You received his number last time, didn't you?

16:46.210 --> 16:48.720
Why? Are you scared...

16:49.049 --> 16:50.490
that I might do something else to you?

16:59.730 --> 17:00.929
Don't worry.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.129
I need to finish what I started.

17:04.099 --> 17:05.128
That's all.

17:16.109 --> 17:18.250
(Yun Seong Hui, Woo A Jin.)

17:22.919 --> 17:24.989
(Yun Seong Hui.)

17:33.699 --> 17:35.959
Mr. Ahn! We're in big trouble!

17:36.429 --> 17:38.129
What's the matter?

17:38.330 --> 17:39.330
Look at this.

17:40.570 --> 17:44.870
Among Daesung Pulp's products, a fluorescent whitening agent was...

17:44.870 --> 17:48.110
found in large amounts.

17:50.780 --> 17:53.379
A sanitary paper company recently responded to the controversy...

17:53.379 --> 17:57.020
about the fluorescent whitening agent found in their toilet paper.

17:57.290 --> 18:00.219
As a result of a total inspection of toilet paper...

18:00.219 --> 18:01.919
produced in this country,

18:02.120 --> 18:03.560
large amounts of a fluorescent whitening agent...

18:03.560 --> 18:05.459
were only found in Daesung Pulp's paper,

18:05.459 --> 18:06.659
which has shocked the country.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.000
It was reporter Park Ki Ryang.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.270
Are you all right?

18:10.399 --> 18:12.469
Tell A Jin to come home. I need A Jin.

18:12.929 --> 18:14.969
Then, I'll go forward with the lawsuit right away.

18:15.370 --> 18:16.770
I'll need a list of your possessions, first.

18:17.370 --> 18:18.669
Thank you for your help in advance.

18:18.939 --> 18:20.909
No problem. I'll do my best.

18:22.110 --> 18:24.179
You'll come out to this week's meditation class, right?

18:25.209 --> 18:27.419
- I'm not sure. - At a time like this,

18:27.419 --> 18:29.649
you really need it. Please come out.

18:31.149 --> 18:32.850
Okay, I will.

18:43.229 --> 18:44.899
- Hello? - Where are you right now?

18:45.330 --> 18:46.570
Why? What's the matter?

18:46.899 --> 18:47.899
Goodness.

18:48.239 --> 18:49.439
Haven't you seen the news?

18:50.270 --> 18:52.270
Your father wants to see you right now.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.080
Come home.

18:59.919 --> 19:03.350
A reexamination of the Korean toilet paper company...

19:03.350 --> 19:07.159
uncovered more fluorescent material...

19:09.929 --> 19:10.929
What's the matter?

19:11.729 --> 19:13.300
I need to get going.

19:14.699 --> 19:15.699
Goodbye.

19:19.729 --> 19:21.169
- Mr. Kang. - Yes?

19:21.840 --> 19:24.070
She's really pretty, isn't she?

19:25.939 --> 19:27.080
Yes, I guess so.

19:27.639 --> 19:28.639
Are you interested?

19:29.010 --> 19:31.449
No way, she's a married woman.

19:32.909 --> 19:36.820
Although, she might be single very soon.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.560
Fluorescent whitening agents are...

19:43.560 --> 19:46.429
chemical agents used to make toilet look white and clean.

19:46.629 --> 19:48.800
But it is known to be a cancer-causing agent...

19:48.800 --> 19:51.300
depending on the person's immune system.

19:51.699 --> 19:54.239
A Jin, what do you think we should do?

19:54.939 --> 19:57.209
We need to resolve one problem at a time, Father.

19:58.010 --> 20:01.110
Regenerated pulp is a raw material that all companies have always used.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.350
That's because the unit price is low and it's known to be a recycling.

20:06.050 --> 20:08.479
However, as the brightening agent controversy arose,

20:08.879 --> 20:11.020
everyone else switched to a natural pulp,

20:11.419 --> 20:13.790
while Daesung Pulp handled it complacently.

20:16.260 --> 20:17.290
What are our alternatives?

20:17.459 --> 20:21.459
Taking the blow and giving an honest apology is the best way.

20:22.129 --> 20:24.800
We were too devoted to our goal of providing affordable toilet paper...

20:24.929 --> 20:27.770
to relieve our consumers' financial burden,

20:28.199 --> 20:30.909
so we inevitably continued to use regenerated pulp...

20:31.040 --> 20:33.040
in order to lower the unit price.

20:33.909 --> 20:36.679
We failed to notice that harmful materials could be detected,

20:37.050 --> 20:38.750
and we were unable to notify our consumers about it,

20:38.750 --> 20:40.379
so we're very sorry.

20:40.750 --> 20:43.919
We didn't fail to notify our consumers on purpose,

20:43.919 --> 20:47.290
but it happened in the process of swapping out our package design.

20:47.659 --> 20:50.860
We're very sorry. Is that enough?

20:51.129 --> 20:53.159
Yes, that's enough.

20:53.860 --> 20:54.860
Gosh.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.629
I can't believe this is how Jae Seok did his job.

21:00.100 --> 21:03.370
But, will that calm down the situation?

21:03.770 --> 21:06.979
Admit defeat, even if that leads to a loss, Father.

21:07.139 --> 21:08.280
That's the only way to survive.

21:08.580 --> 21:09.810
We can't do anything about...

21:09.949 --> 21:12.149
used products due to the nature of the product,

21:12.409 --> 21:14.379
but we need to allow exchanges or refunds for unopened products,

21:14.649 --> 21:16.889
and calm down our consumers.

21:17.719 --> 21:20.659
First, make it so that they can exchange or return their products...

21:20.719 --> 21:23.020
even if they don't have their receipts.

21:23.260 --> 21:26.159
Okay, go ahead and handle that.

21:27.030 --> 21:30.429
This isn't something I should trust Jae Seok with.

21:30.699 --> 21:32.699
No, I won't do that.

21:33.399 --> 21:35.600
I will no longer intervene in company matters.

21:36.239 --> 21:37.770
- A Jin. - I'm going to...

21:38.570 --> 21:39.979
divorce Ahn Jae Seok.

21:41.939 --> 21:45.879
You can't. I'll apologize on his behalf, so don't divorce him.

21:46.409 --> 21:49.120
If you endure it for a little longer, Jae Seok will come around.

21:49.419 --> 21:51.850
That punk does foolish things from time to time.

21:52.389 --> 21:56.159
No, I want to respect my worth.

21:57.129 --> 22:00.459
I'm too good to live with that man.

22:03.830 --> 22:06.899
I'll kick Jae Seok out of my company, and give you...

22:06.899 --> 22:09.300
all of his shares. I'll put you in his position.

22:09.840 --> 22:10.840
Will you still divorce him?

22:12.840 --> 22:15.179
That's a really tempting offer.

22:16.179 --> 22:17.610
But, Father,

22:18.479 --> 22:22.550
if that offer is only valid as long as I stay married to Ahn Jae Seok,

22:23.649 --> 22:25.489
I'll turn down that offer.

22:41.939 --> 22:42.969
Chairman Ahn.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.239
I'll try to step up this time.

22:51.979 --> 22:55.149
I think you weighed the seriousness of your marriage differently.

22:56.790 --> 22:59.219
It sounds like your husband, Ahn Jae Seok took...

22:59.219 --> 23:00.860
your marriage lightly.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.760
He just viewed it as a sensual union between a man and a woman.

23:05.629 --> 23:07.800
I bet he wanted to marry and have babies with the woman...

23:08.100 --> 23:10.169
who excites him and then live his life however he wanted.

23:11.699 --> 23:15.469
But for you, marriage means a lot more than that.

23:16.739 --> 23:19.040
Responsibility, solidarity, and promise.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.439
You viewed marriage to hold such meanings.

23:24.179 --> 23:25.409
The seriousness of marriage?

23:27.250 --> 23:28.379
The seriousness of marriage...

23:41.830 --> 23:46.100
(A shared ownership and takeover contract of private academy)

23:53.479 --> 23:57.110
(A certified register of buildings under possession)

24:04.590 --> 24:05.620
Honey.

24:06.889 --> 24:10.330
Wipe that frown off your face. I told you not to worry too much.

24:11.129 --> 24:14.899
My face feels hot at the thought of apologizing to the press.

24:16.129 --> 24:19.600
If you really don't want to do it, I will.

24:21.939 --> 24:25.840
I'm technically a director now, too.

24:27.639 --> 24:28.780
Are you saying you'll do it?

24:29.439 --> 24:30.610
I'm just saying,

24:30.810 --> 24:33.850
it'd look sincerer if I stepped up...

24:33.850 --> 24:37.149
rather than making those laughable members speak in your stead.

24:37.550 --> 24:39.520
There's no reason why I can't do it.

24:39.919 --> 24:42.360
It's not like we can make A Jin do it, right?

24:42.959 --> 24:45.090
Your steps are a little shaky today too,

24:45.090 --> 24:49.000
so if you step up, they'll probably say you're putting on a show.

24:49.729 --> 24:50.770
You're right.

24:52.070 --> 24:54.100
Trust me with this.

24:55.699 --> 24:58.110
And for my business card,

24:58.439 --> 25:01.709
I changed my name to Park Ji Yeong.

25:06.449 --> 25:09.280
I think I'll use this opportunity to change my name.

25:10.149 --> 25:12.850
Why? I like Park Bok Ja.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.340
Please continue to update me...

25:28.800 --> 25:31.310
on everything Chairman Ahn does, okay?

25:31.709 --> 25:32.739
Of course, ma'am.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.250
A Jin!

25:47.260 --> 25:48.590
I'll give you a few more tips.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.830
I'll give you a list of the most influential media outlets.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.129
It'll include a list of reporters.

25:55.629 --> 25:57.199
I'll notify the company's PR department.

25:57.929 --> 25:59.530
Meet them privately.

25:59.939 --> 26:00.969
And do what?

26:01.139 --> 26:02.800
Give them an unexpected gift.

26:03.739 --> 26:05.610
A gift that can move their hearts.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.280
A gift?

26:11.909 --> 26:14.350
It shouldn't conflict with the law in any major way.

26:14.550 --> 26:16.250
Just tell them it's kimchi that you made yourself.

26:16.550 --> 26:18.389
How much could that possibly cost?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.520
The radish was grown in your vegetable garden, so it's free.

26:20.820 --> 26:23.060
It's chili powder, salt, and fish sauce at the most.

26:23.530 --> 26:25.229
But the production line is the most urgent.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.629
You must switch to natural pulp from regenerated pulp...

26:29.629 --> 26:31.770
even if you have to raise the unit price of the raw materials.

26:32.370 --> 26:34.739
And you must come up with a strategy to produce high-quality products.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.169
A reformation of the company's bad image is the most urgent.

26:39.810 --> 26:41.139
I got it, but...

26:42.010 --> 26:45.550
why are you helping me if you're getting divorced?

26:46.679 --> 26:48.350
Because it's Ji Hu's grandfather's company.

26:50.620 --> 26:51.719
I'll get going now.

26:52.649 --> 26:54.159
I trust that my advice was helpful.

27:16.949 --> 27:18.580
- We'll continue this later. - Okay.

27:20.179 --> 27:23.489
I have something to tell you before we begin our meditation.

27:24.219 --> 27:28.090
I'm going to close down the academy at the end of this month.

27:31.260 --> 27:33.699
This is what I've expected.

27:34.929 --> 27:38.270
I started the most sensitive education business...

27:38.270 --> 27:40.770
in the most special area of Gangnam.

27:41.639 --> 27:45.040
As a result of running this academy with a view that Gangnam is against,

27:45.409 --> 27:47.979
I was ostracized by the parents.

27:49.979 --> 27:52.050
But if I could turn back time,

27:52.350 --> 27:53.820
I would have made the same decision.

27:55.449 --> 27:56.449
I don't regret it.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.360
Mr. Kang's meditation topic for today is...

28:01.419 --> 28:03.790
called "Beautiful Failure,"

28:03.959 --> 28:06.459
and that made me wonder...

28:06.459 --> 28:09.899
if he came here with this topic because he knew about my situation.

28:14.969 --> 28:17.669
I don't think all failures...

28:18.340 --> 28:20.209
are bad.

28:22.239 --> 28:25.310
At times, a hurdle lies in front of the door to happiness...

28:26.580 --> 28:28.679
in the form of failure.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.919
Even though I failed my academy business...

28:35.659 --> 28:38.929
I realized I'm living properly without fading away.

28:39.530 --> 28:42.699
I actually ended up reflecting upon my life, so my self-esteem...

28:42.760 --> 28:43.929
has improved.

28:58.949 --> 28:59.979
Goodness.

29:00.879 --> 29:02.719
It looks like I ended up leading the class.

29:04.590 --> 29:06.919
Keep going. I'll let you lead the class today.

29:08.419 --> 29:09.620
No. I shouldn't do that.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.830
Okay, that's how I failed.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.229
I ask for your applause.

29:17.469 --> 29:19.070
I love you.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.100
I love you.

29:25.739 --> 29:26.780
We love you, too!

29:35.750 --> 29:39.120
(Daesung pulp power embossing 3-layer roll)

29:48.030 --> 29:50.629
It's a relief that an article came out...

29:50.699 --> 29:54.370
about sanitary pads being harmless to humans.

29:55.469 --> 29:56.469
Mr. Park.

29:57.709 --> 29:58.709
Yes?

30:01.639 --> 30:02.679
I'm sad.

30:05.050 --> 30:06.080
In the end,

30:07.520 --> 30:08.520
my wife...

30:09.580 --> 30:11.050
wants to file for divorce.

30:16.689 --> 30:17.729
Is my sunshine...

30:18.959 --> 30:20.899
really leaving me like this?

30:27.139 --> 30:29.370
Why are we so busy all of a sudden?

30:29.969 --> 30:31.669
This is a special order for Daesung Pulp.

30:31.810 --> 30:33.739
You'll pay us a lot for this, right?

30:34.409 --> 30:35.409
Of course.

30:45.520 --> 30:48.219
I wonder what's in that extract.

30:48.419 --> 30:49.560
I know, right?

A Jin.

30:56.199 --> 30:58.229
Didn't the cleaning lady come to work today?

30:58.370 --> 31:00.239
No, I told her not to come.

31:00.639 --> 31:02.669
- Why? - Just because.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.439
I'm sure she needs some time off. Do you need a vacation, too?

31:09.479 --> 31:11.780
Work is a sacred thing, don't you think?

31:13.179 --> 31:14.620
I even cleaned the washroom earlier.

31:16.379 --> 31:18.790
Should we order a late-night snack? Jokbal.

31:19.550 --> 31:20.590
I'm in!

31:25.429 --> 31:27.260
About that pattern on the ceiling...

31:29.060 --> 31:32.370
Is that a baroque style or a rococo style?

31:34.370 --> 31:37.370
A Jin told me about it when she picked it out,

31:37.370 --> 31:38.639
but I can't remember.

31:44.879 --> 31:46.780
Don't get annoyed.

31:48.379 --> 31:50.620
I'm having a hard time, too.

33:05.489 --> 33:06.830
We received a report.

33:06.830 --> 33:07.959
This wasn't arson.

33:08.899 --> 33:09.969
I'll clean it up.

33:10.370 --> 33:12.030
It's hard to burn anything...

33:12.030 --> 33:14.100
because of Gangnam's floor area ratio and price of land.

33:14.100 --> 33:15.199
But you can't do this.

33:20.479 --> 33:21.939
It's not like I can burn my husband, right?

33:32.389 --> 33:33.520
Let's meet tomorrow.

33:35.159 --> 33:38.129
"What for?" Are we not allowed to see each other?

33:38.860 --> 33:40.229
You said it yourself.

33:40.500 --> 33:43.530
You said I paid you to do something about Park Bok Ja.

33:45.530 --> 33:46.530
Let's meet.

33:48.669 --> 33:50.340
I'll decide on the location and text you tomorrow.

33:59.179 --> 34:01.250
- Ju Mi. - Don't.

34:03.550 --> 34:06.250
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

34:07.560 --> 34:08.859
I'll go back to America.

34:09.889 --> 34:13.500
Don't go. Claim what belongs to you and Un Gyu, first.

34:13.730 --> 34:15.759
You can't back down. We are...

34:16.799 --> 34:18.000
on the edge of a cliff right now.

34:18.199 --> 34:19.670
It's all useless.

34:19.770 --> 34:22.839
No, if you can't do that, do something before you go.

34:24.239 --> 34:25.670
- Like what? - At least...

34:27.609 --> 34:28.980
kill that woman before you go.

35:01.779 --> 35:03.139
I'll have to break up our team, right?

35:06.179 --> 35:08.480
Just do it with Su Min and Jeong Hyeon.

35:09.549 --> 35:10.549
Will you do that?

35:11.719 --> 35:12.719
I have to.

35:13.889 --> 35:14.920
Hey.

35:15.859 --> 35:17.429
What should I do?

35:18.330 --> 35:19.389
Gi Ok.

35:19.630 --> 35:23.159
I feel so sorry for our Jeong Woo.

35:25.900 --> 35:27.569
What if...

35:28.770 --> 35:30.739
What if that child is really my husband's?

35:31.940 --> 35:33.040
No way.

35:33.170 --> 35:35.009
She probably wasn't careful because she's infertile.

35:35.279 --> 35:36.679
She doesn't even know whose it is.

35:37.679 --> 35:40.219
Gosh! I'm so disgusted.

35:44.589 --> 35:46.859
Gi Ok, abandon your husband.

35:48.389 --> 35:49.889
I'm not telling you to divorce him.

35:51.190 --> 35:52.190
Just...

35:53.529 --> 35:55.000
abandon all feelings for him.

35:56.900 --> 36:00.069
I can't abandon my husband.

36:01.940 --> 36:05.139
I can't get rid of my lingering attachment to him.

36:19.350 --> 36:20.359
Can we talk?

36:25.259 --> 36:26.900
Don't worry. Dr. Jang doesn't know I'm here.

36:27.630 --> 36:29.759
- Okay. - I want to ask you a favor.

36:30.529 --> 36:33.500
You know the text you sent me with an anonymous number?

36:33.799 --> 36:35.839
How did you do that? How do you send those?

36:36.270 --> 36:38.870
I did that on the internet.

36:39.540 --> 36:40.580
Teach me how.

36:41.980 --> 36:43.080
Seong Hui!

36:44.549 --> 36:46.179
- Are you here? - Yes.

36:47.279 --> 36:51.049
Oh my, what a nice house. Where's my son-in-law?

36:51.489 --> 36:53.319
What? Your son-in-law?

36:53.659 --> 36:55.060
Aren't you going to introduce me?

36:56.060 --> 36:58.389
Did you do what I told you to do?

36:59.489 --> 37:01.630
- What? - The ownership of this house!

37:01.630 --> 37:03.830
I told you to change it to your name. Did you do that?

37:05.400 --> 37:06.500
I did.

37:08.270 --> 37:10.609
How could you let that lady do that?

37:10.609 --> 37:13.509
Shut up, you punk! Then should it have been you or me?

37:13.509 --> 37:15.739
You should have told A Jin to do it instead!

37:16.710 --> 37:19.310
A Jin said she wouldn't do it! She said she's going to divorce you!

37:19.380 --> 37:20.819
She wouldn't do it no matter what I offered her!

recalled the problematic products,

37:56.520 --> 37:59.520

37:59.889 --> 38:03.020
and we're currently producing high-quality products...

38:03.159 --> 38:05.460
that only contain harmless, natural pulp.

Daesung Pulp's toilet paper is...

38:31.319 --> 38:33.319
now harmless, even when swallowed.

38:40.429 --> 38:42.000
From now on,

38:42.130 --> 38:44.830
Daesung Pulp will only increase the production...

38:47.870 --> 38:48.969

43:28.319 --> 43:30.290
because of tax issues.

50:12.819 --> 50:13.989
You didn't say anything, right?

50:16.089 --> 50:18.659
You better not get entangled in her scheme.

50:19.290 --> 50:22.159
Why would I get entangled in it? I won't.

50:23.870 --> 50:26.969
I'm just telling you I met up with her. I'm hanging up.

51:02.569 --> 51:05.239
A Jin, you're just going to leave Jae Hui's room, right?

51:05.310 --> 51:06.310
Yes.

51:06.509 --> 51:07.839
But where did Jae Hui go?

51:08.040 --> 51:09.580
- She went to Jeju Island. - Pardon?

51:09.580 --> 51:11.279
She went to pick up her clothes for the new season.

51:11.779 --> 51:12.810
No one can stop her.

51:12.810 --> 51:16.790
Sir, those items are fragile, so please wrap them up carefully.

51:19.750 --> 51:22.859
And we're not taking those suitcases, so you can leave them.

51:23.020 --> 51:24.060
Okay.

51:26.060 --> 51:28.830
- Finish this up for me. - Don't worry.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.370
Our princess is doing well, right?

51:30.799 --> 51:32.100
Of course.

51:32.799 --> 51:34.170
- Ji Hu. - Yes?

51:34.900 --> 51:37.409
Will you be okay going to school from here?

51:37.409 --> 51:39.210
Won't it be difficult because it's so far?

51:39.940 --> 51:43.139
Jin Hee said she'll take me to school every morning.

51:43.310 --> 51:44.549
I like Jin Hee.

51:45.480 --> 51:46.620
That's a relief.

51:47.179 --> 51:50.190
What do you want to eat? I'll cook you something delicious.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.589
- Grandma. - Yes?

51:54.259 --> 51:56.520
Make me food that you used to make Mom when she was my age.

51:56.730 --> 51:58.429
What did Mom like when she was ten?

51:59.429 --> 52:02.730
Your mom liked seasoned bean sprouts at that age.

52:03.100 --> 52:06.569
I didn't have much money, so I couldn't make much for her.

52:07.540 --> 52:09.069
Then, make that for me, too.

52:09.969 --> 52:11.310
- Why? - Just because.

52:11.609 --> 52:13.810
I want to try what Mom used to eat.

52:14.380 --> 52:16.409
Then I'll grow up to be pretty, just like Mom.

52:16.880 --> 52:20.580
Gosh, my baby. Who did you take after to be so loveable?

52:20.980 --> 52:23.389
I took after Mom. Who else?

52:24.489 --> 52:26.659
Gosh, our puppy.

52:27.020 --> 52:29.290
Gosh. You're so loveable.

52:33.859 --> 52:38.230
(Daesung Pulp)

53:08.299 --> 53:10.170
Wait, why am I bowing down to her?

53:11.199 --> 53:12.199
My goodness.

53:14.839 --> 53:15.839
A Jin!

53:18.270 --> 53:20.540
- Are my clothes and shoes here? - Of course.

54:05.449 --> 54:06.449
Mom!

54:06.659 --> 54:10.460
Ji Hu, I need to pick up something, so until then,

54:10.859 --> 54:11.960
hang in there, okay?

54:11.960 --> 54:14.460
- Don't worry. - You're a brave girl.

54:14.929 --> 54:17.730
I'll call you later. Okay, I love you.

54:18.130 --> 54:19.170
I love you, too.

54:28.940 --> 54:30.679
What does Jae Seok like to eat?

54:31.250 --> 54:34.350
I won that man over with cheap food, Mom.

54:35.179 --> 54:36.949
Is it because he ate fancy food all his life?

54:37.089 --> 54:38.790
He likes food from transport cafes.

54:39.020 --> 54:40.020
Really?

54:40.020 --> 54:42.719
Then should I show off my cooking skills today?

54:42.859 --> 54:43.889
Go ahead.

54:49.929 --> 54:50.929
Jae Gu!

54:57.969 --> 55:00.380
Which room is Park Bok Ja in?

55:12.420 --> 55:15.989
(Movers 24 Express)

55:23.400 --> 55:25.699
Sir...

55:25.770 --> 55:26.770
Okay.

55:27.339 --> 55:28.540
It looks like someone's moving in.

55:28.900 --> 55:29.940
Yes.

55:32.339 --> 55:36.210
(Vice-chairwoman Park Ji Yeong)

55:56.299 --> 55:57.330
What is this?

56:05.639 --> 56:06.639
Hey, you.

56:07.279 --> 56:09.480
I know why you came into our house.

56:10.449 --> 56:11.549
Are you looking down on me?

56:13.650 --> 56:16.049
Do you think you can just kick my wife and child out of the house?

56:26.460 --> 56:28.330
"Vice-Chairwoman," my gosh.

56:29.900 --> 56:31.900
Jae Gu! What are you doing?

56:32.969 --> 56:34.940
- Jae Gu, don't. - Mark my words.

56:35.339 --> 56:37.040
I'll kill this woman today and go to jail.

56:37.310 --> 56:39.109
- Let go! Don't stop me! - Try to kill me!

56:39.670 --> 56:40.679
Try to kill me.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.080
Go on!

56:42.339 --> 56:44.549
Kill me!

56:55.659 --> 56:57.029
What on earth are you doing?

56:57.589 --> 56:59.560
I'm here to claim my house back.

56:59.759 --> 57:02.529
This house is under my child's name.

57:02.659 --> 57:04.370
This isn't your house!

57:04.429 --> 57:07.540
I'm going to report you to the police for unauthorized trespassing.

57:07.600 --> 57:11.040
Good idea. I was going to do that. Go ahead.

57:22.150 --> 57:24.520
Life was truly a war.

57:25.219 --> 57:28.790
For those who longed for peace, and who had thirst for desire,

57:29.420 --> 57:31.690
war was inevitable.

58:02.989 --> 58:05.159
(The Lady in Dignity)

58:05.659 --> 58:08.060
I can't forgive him this time!

58:08.159 --> 58:10.230
I won't settle. Lock me up.

58:10.400 --> 58:13.540
You are no match for me.

58:13.699 --> 58:15.739
Let's see who wins.

58:15.900 --> 58:18.409
Take care of your imprisoned husband for now.

58:19.069 --> 58:20.279
I'll protect our family.

58:20.279 --> 58:23.080
- Will you break up with her? - Not that.

58:23.080 --> 58:24.779
Your crazy!

58:25.509 --> 58:28.819
My wife is pregnant. It's not my child.

58:28.819 --> 58:32.150
- Who's the father? - Mind your own business.

58:32.319 --> 58:34.920
- Isn't she... - I'll have someone follow her.

58:35.120 --> 58:38.589
Do you think it's yours because it has your name on it?

58:39.929 --> 58:41.799
I'll punish you for not raising your kid properly!

58:41.799 --> 58:43.429
- You shameless woman. - Hey!

58:44.929 --> 58:48.270
Coexistence is what you wanted. How do you like it so far?

58:49.969 --> 58:53.170
Do you think Park Bok Ja will take care of you forever?

58:53.310 --> 58:55.509
She will use you and abandon you.

58:55.509 --> 58:57.580
I wish you would find your own true life,

58:58.109 --> 58:59.679
and not harm anyone.

58:59.949 --> 59:03.420
I don't know who'll kill you, but it'll happen sooner or later.
