CRAZY SISSY'S DAD.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.342
THAT'S TERRIBLE. SISSY WAS

00:06.089 --> 00:08.342
A GOOD FRIEND OF YOURS.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.552
MOM, SISSY TALKED

00:08.383 --> 00:10.552
TO HER STUFFED ANIMALS.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.011
LET'S START

00:10.594 --> 00:12.011
A NEW TOPIC.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.806
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.975
EVERYTHING'S A JOKE.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.975
EVERYONE'S A PUNCH LINE.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.518
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

SORRY FOR THAT --

A LITTLE TROUBLE

00:20.479 --> 00:22.815
IN OUR CHINA OFFICE.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.525
WHAT DID I MISS?

00:24.566 --> 00:27.486
I WAS BEING IMPOSSIBLE THEN

00:24.566 --> 00:27.486
I TURNED INTO A JEWISH COMEDIAN.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.613
OH.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.613
WELL, CONTINUE.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.824
THANK YOU.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.824

YOUR GRANDFATHER AND I

00:35.410 --> 00:37.663
THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE NICE

00:37.705 --> 00:39.707
FOR YOU TO GO AROUND

00:37.705 --> 00:39.707
AND PICK OUT

00:39.748 --> 00:42.292
WHAT YOU'D LIKE US

00:39.748 --> 00:42.292

00:42.334 --> 00:44.628
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

00:42.334 --> 00:44.628
DESK IN MY OFFICE.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.296
IT'S A REALLY FINE

00:44.670 --> 00:46.296
GEORGIAN PIECE.

00:46.338 --> 00:49.090
WHY DON'T I EVER BRING A

00:46.338 --> 00:49.090
TAPE RECORDER TO THESE DINNERS?

00:49.132 --> 00:50.885
ANYTHING YOU WANT

00:49.132 --> 00:50.885
TO LEAVE ME IS FINE.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.261
NONSENSE. YOU SHOULD

00:50.926 --> 00:53.261
HAVE WHAT YOU LIKE.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.847
LOOK AROUND,

00:53.303 --> 00:54.847
IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING

00:54.889 --> 00:56.598

00:56.640 --> 01:00.143
YOU TWO HAVE HIT A LEVEL OF

00:56.640 --> 01:00.143
WEIRD THAT EVEN<i> I</i> MARVEL AT.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.062
YOU CAN PICK OUT THINGS, TOO.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.689
NOW IT'S LESS CREEPY.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.983
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.983
APPARENTLY WE'RE CREEPY.

01:06.025 --> 01:08.569
YES, WELL,

01:06.025 --> 01:08.569

OH, COOL!

01:09.653 --> 01:10.863
WHAT'S THAT?

01:10.905 --> 01:12.364
IT'S DESSERT.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.364
IT'S PUDDING.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.992
IF YOU KNEW WHAT IT WAS,

01:12.406 --> 01:14.992
WHY DID YOU ASK?

01:15.034 --> 01:16.702
YOU DON'T LIKE PUDDING.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.245
Emily: YES,

01:16.744 --> 01:18.245
BUT<i> YOU</i> LIKE PUDDING.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.497
OH, I LOVE PUDDING.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.497
I WORSHIP IT.

I HAVE A BOWL

01:23.083 --> 01:24.835

01:23.083 --> 01:24.835

I'VE NEVER HAD PUDDING

01:24.877 --> 01:27.128

02:35.906 --> 02:38.075

02:41.495 --> 02:43.914
THIS IS THE STRANGEST EVENING

02:41.495 --> 02:43.914
I'VE EVER SPENT HERE.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.290
SO, HOW ARE WE DOING?

02:45.332 --> 02:47.876
GREAT, JUST GETTING

02:45.332 --> 02:47.876
READY FOR THE BIG DAY.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.336
VERY NICE.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.671
SO, IT'S GETTING LATE,

02:49.377 --> 02:50.671
MOM.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.213
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT

02:50.712 --> 02:52.213
SOME FUNERAL PLOTS

02:52.255 --> 02:54.633
FOR US TO DECORATE,

02:52.255 --> 02:54.633
WE SHOULD REALLY GET GOING.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.677
ANY SPECIAL REQUESTS

02:54.675 --> 02:56.677
FOR DINNER NEXT WEEK?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.219
OH, WELL --

02:58.261 --> 03:00.014
MOM,

02:58.261 --> 03:00.014
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

03:00.055 --> 03:03.100
RORY, GO SAY GOODBYE

03:00.055 --> 03:03.100
TO GRANDPA.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.434
VERY SMOOTH.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.562
SHALL I SIT DOWN?

03:07.604 --> 03:09.397
YEAH, BUT NOT THERE.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.484
WE GOT A POST-IT ON THAT.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.484
WE'D LIKE TO KEEP IT NICE.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.695
IT MUST BE<i> VERY</i> EXHAUSTING

03:12.526 --> 03:14.695
TO BE YOU.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.947
MOM, RORY'S BIRTHDAY

03:14.736 --> 03:16.947
IS NEXT FRIDAY.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.824
I KNOW THAT.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.161
WE WERE THINKING WE COULD PUSH

03:18.866 --> 03:22.161
OUR DINNER TO SATURDAY.

03:22.201 --> 03:24.203
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO

03:22.201 --> 03:24.203
ON FRIDAY?

03:24.245 --> 03:26.373
YOU'LL COME HERE

03:24.245 --> 03:26.373
AND WE'LL HAVE A PARTY.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.667
I WAS HOPING WE COULD DO IT

03:26.414 --> 03:28.667
ANOTHER NIGHT.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.461
WHY? HER BIRTHDAY FALLS

03:28.709 --> 03:31.461
ON THE NIGHT YOU<i> DO</i> COME HERE.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.754
SATURDAY'S A GOOD NIGHT.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.673
NOT AS GOOD AS FRIDAY.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.673
DAMN CLOSE.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.592
NOT FROM WHERE

03:34.715 --> 03:37.592
I'M STANDING.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.592
MOVE THEN.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.470
I'M SORRY.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.470
FRIDAY NIGHTS ARE MY NIGHTS.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.930
THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED ON

03:41.972 --> 03:44.058
WHEN YOU BORROWED MONEY

03:41.972 --> 03:44.058
FOR HER SCHOOL.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.767
I DIDN'T INTEND

03:44.099 --> 03:45.767
FOR THIS LOAN

03:45.809 --> 03:48.269
TO BECOME A CONSTANT SOURCE

03:45.809 --> 03:48.269
OF BLACKMAIL.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.730
THIS IS<i> MY</i> KID'S BIRTHDAY,

03:49.771 --> 03:52.273
AND SHE WILL HAVE HER PARTY

03:49.771 --> 03:52.273
AT HOME ON FRIDAY.

03:52.315 --> 03:56.444
THAT'S IT. END OF STORY.

03:52.315 --> 03:56.444
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]

03:56.486 --> 03:59.447
SO, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE

03:56.486 --> 03:59.447
TWO PARTIES THIS YEAR?

03:59.489 --> 04:00.991
YOU COULDN'T GET HER

03:59.489 --> 04:00.991
TO CAVE.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.492
NO, BUT SHE<i> DID</i> AGREE

04:02.534 --> 04:04.786
TO MAKE THE STRING QUARTET

04:02.534 --> 04:04.786
LEARN "LIKE A VIRGIN."

04:04.828 --> 04:06.121
WELL, YOU TRIED.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.123
SWEETIE, I PROMISE,

04:06.163 --> 04:08.123
SATURDAY NIGHT,

04:08.165 --> 04:11.626
WE'LL DO IT RIGHT AT HOME --

04:08.165 --> 04:11.626
A STARS HOLLOW EXTRAVAGANZA.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.713
IS THIS PARTY GRANDMA'S HAVING

04:11.668 --> 04:14.713
GONNA BE A BIG DEAL?

04:14.755 --> 04:16.631
NOT REALLY.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.675
THE GOVERNMENT WILL CLOSE

04:16.673 --> 04:18.675
THAT DAY.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.510
FLAGS WILL FLY

04:18.717 --> 04:20.510
AT HALF-MAST.

04:20.552 --> 04:23.847
BARBRA STREISAND WILL GIVE

04:20.552 --> 04:23.847
HER FINAL CONCERT...AGAIN.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.808
THE POPE HAS PLANS.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.808
HE'S TRYING TO GET OUT OF THEM.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.770
HOWEVER, ELVIS

04:26.850 --> 04:29.770
<i>AND</i> JIM MORRISON ARE COMING,

04:29.811 --> 04:31.438
AND THEY'RE BRINGING CHIPS.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.689
YOU ASK

04:31.479 --> 04:32.689
A SIMPLE QUESTION...

04:34.691 --> 04:38.070
Sookie: MINI ORANGE BISCUITS

04:34.691 --> 04:38.070
WITH HONEY-MUSTARD HAM...

04:38.112 --> 04:39.362
YUM.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.031
...ANGEL WINGS

04:39.404 --> 04:41.031
WITH DIPPING SAUCE.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.366
OH, DID YOU BRING ME

04:41.073 --> 04:43.366
THE PICTURE?

04:41.073 --> 04:43.366
OH, YEAH.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.911
IT'S TOO BAD YOU COULDN'T HER

04:43.408 --> 04:45.911
TO RELINQUISH FRIDAY NIGHT.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.456
NO, SHE HAS HER VULCAN

04:45.953 --> 04:49.456
DEATH GRIP ON THAT ONE.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.456
NOT SURPRISING.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.042
EMILY GILMORE --

04:49.497 --> 04:52.042
YOU COULD SET YOUR WATCH BY HER.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.335
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW

04:52.084 --> 04:54.335
WHAT SHE<i> DID</i> DO LAST NIGHT?

04:54.377 --> 04:55.462
WORE JEANS.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.589
SERVED PUDDING.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.589
I WAS CLOSE.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.340
I'M SURE IT WAS

04:57.631 --> 04:59.340
EXPENSIVE PUDDING,

04:59.382 --> 05:02.094
BUT IT WAS<i> PUDDING.</i>

04:59.382 --> 05:02.094
THAT IS AMAZING.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.638
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT

05:02.136 --> 05:04.638
SHE ACTUALLY MADE A MENTAL NOTE

05:04.679 --> 05:06.140
THAT WE LIKED PUDDING,

05:06.181 --> 05:07.933
WHICH WOULD MEAN

05:06.181 --> 05:07.933
SHE LISTENED TO SOMETHING

05:07.975 --> 05:10.393
OTHER THAN THE JUDGMENTAL

05:07.975 --> 05:10.393
CONGA LINE IN HER HEAD

05:10.435 --> 05:13.188
<i>AND</i> GOT OVER THE FACT THAT

05:10.435 --> 05:13.188
HER PUDDING IS HOSPITAL FOOD,

05:13.230 --> 05:16.191
AND ONLY ACCEPTABLE WHEN

05:13.230 --> 05:16.191
YOU'VE HAD AN ORGAN RIPPED OUT.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.527
WOW, THAT'S SOME JOURNEY

05:16.233 --> 05:19.527
SHE HAD TO TAKE THERE.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.321
OPEN YOUR MOUTH

05:19.569 --> 05:21.321
AND CLOSE YOUR EYES.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.991
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

05:21.362 --> 05:23.991
RIGHT, SORRY.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.827
OPEN YOUR MOUTH

05:24.032 --> 05:26.827
AND CLOSE YOUR EYES.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.827
OKAY.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.704
GET READY FOR SOMETHING

05:26.868 --> 05:29.704
TRULY AMAZING.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.916
MMM! YEAH!

05:32.958 --> 05:34.584
WHAT IS IT?

05:32.958 --> 05:34.584
I DON'T KNOW.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.627
IT'S LIKE A --

05:35.669 --> 05:37.087
A WHAT?

05:37.129 --> 05:39.464
IT'S LIKE A BERRY

05:37.129 --> 05:39.464
BUT WAY MORE EXOTIC.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.300
YES! GOOD!

05:41.340 --> 05:43.677
HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING REACTIONS

05:41.340 --> 05:43.677
TO YOUR FERTILIZER FUMES?

05:43.718 --> 05:46.471
I HAVE BEEN TOYING

05:43.718 --> 05:46.471
WITH CROSS-POLLINATION.

05:46.513 --> 05:50.809
I FIGURED OUT A WAY TO CROSS

05:46.513 --> 05:50.809
A RASPBERRY WITH A KUMQUAT!

05:50.851 --> 05:52.560
KUMQUAT --

05:50.851 --> 05:52.560
THAT'S WHAT I TASTE!

05:52.602 --> 05:54.813
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

05:52.602 --> 05:54.813
HOW DID YOU DO THIS?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.606
YOU DIDN'T BUILD ONE

05:54.855 --> 05:56.606
OF THOSE MACHINES

05:56.648 --> 05:58.150
LIKE IN "THE FLY,"

05:56.648 --> 05:58.150
DID YOU?

05:58.192 --> 06:01.402
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND YOU

05:58.192 --> 06:01.402
WITH A RASPBERRY HEAD?

06:01.444 --> 06:02.737
YOU!

06:02.779 --> 06:05.532

34:38.076 --> 34:39.369
NO, THANK YOU.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.913
MOM, YOU'RE GONNA NEED ONE,

34:40.954 --> 34:43.456
I HAVE WINE GLASSES THAT SAY

34:40.954 --> 34:43.456
"HOLIDAY INN" ON THEM.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.333
STOLI ON THE ROCKS

34:43.498 --> 34:45.333
WITH A TWIST.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.636
TO HIT ON MY DAD,

34:56.678 --> 34:58.931
AND I'M SURE MOM'S GONNA CALL

34:56.678 --> 34:58.931
CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES.

34:58.972 --> 35:02.225
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

34:58.972 --> 35:02.225
THEY WERE HERE?

34:58.972 --> 35:02.225
NEVER.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.435
NOT ONCE?

35:03.476 --> 35:04.728
NOT SINCE WE MOVED HERE.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.688
THEY'D COME DOWN

35:04.770 --> 35:06.688
AND VISIT US OCCASIONALLY

35:06.730 --> 35:09.482
WHEN RORY WAS A BABY

35:06.730 --> 35:09.482
AND WE LIVED AT THE INN,

35:09.524 --> 35:11.317
BUT THEY

35:09.524 --> 35:11.317
HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.111
WOW. THAT'S BIG STUFF.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.821
IS RORY THRILLED?

35:13.152 --> 35:14.821

35:14.863 --> 35:16.573
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.367

35:36.093 --> 35:37.594
WHAT TO DO.

BUT REMEMBER --

35:37.636 --> 35:39.220

35:59.992 --> 36:01.994
SO, HOW DOES IT LOOK?

36:02.035 --> 36:04.245
WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK

36:02.035 --> 36:04.245
STRUCTURALLY SOUND.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.332
DRINK UP, DAD.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.461
OKAY, DON'T PANIC.

OH, GOOD OPENING LINE.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.088
WHAT'S WRONG?

36:13.130 --> 36:15.298
WE'RE OUT OF ICE.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.298
HOW CAN WE BE?

36:15.340 --> 36:17.592
IT WAS LIKE

36:15.340 --> 36:17.592
A PENGUIN HABITAT IN THERE.

36:17.634 --> 36:20.386
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.

36:17.634 --> 36:20.386
I JUST KNOW IT'S HAPPENED,

36:20.428 --> 36:22.430
AND SOMEHOW

36:20.428 --> 36:22.430
<i>WE</i> HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

36:22.472 --> 36:24.683

36:35.777 --> 36:37.570
HALLELUJAH.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.156
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

36:39.197 --> 36:42.492
A GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS

36:39.197 --> 36:42.492
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MUCH ICE.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.452
OH, YOU'RE THE BEST!

36:42.534 --> 36:44.452

FINE, THANK YOU.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.130
I'D BETTER GET THESE

36:52.627 --> 36:55.130
IN THE FREEZER BEFORE THEY MELT.

36:55.172 --> 36:57.256
WELL, NOT VERY LIKELY IN HERE.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.184
GRANDPA?

37:07.225 --> 37:09.061

37:09.102 --> 37:11.479
I BROUGHT YOU

37:09.102 --> 37:11.479
SOMETHING TO READ.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.023
IT'S NOT

37:11.521 --> 37:13.023
THE<i> WALL STREET JOURNAL,</i>

37:13.065 --> 37:14.566
BUT THERE'S A QUIZ IN THERE

37:14.607 --> 37:16.860
THAT DETERMINES WHETHER

37:14.607 --> 37:16.860
YOU'RE A SUMMER OR A FALL.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.987
I APPRECIATE THIS.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.987
THANK YOU.

37:24.701 --> 37:28.080
OH, MOREY, YOU REMEMBER THE TIME

37:24.701 --> 37:28.080
THAT RORY DECIDED

37:28.121 --> 37:31.083
THAT OUR OLD TREE STUMP

37:28.121 --> 37:31.083
WAS A FAIRY RING?

37:31.124 --> 37:32.417
I SURE DO.

37:32.458 --> 37:33.960
HOW OLD WAS SHE THEN, SUGAR?

37:34.002 --> 37:35.503
I THINK SHE WAS ABOUT 10.

37:35.545 --> 37:37.839
ALL I KNOW IS THAT IT MATCHED

37:35.545 --> 37:37.839
THE DESCRIPTION.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.591
OH, GOD, SHE WAS CUTE.

37:39.632 --> 37:42.552
SHE USED TO SIT OUT THERE

37:39.632 --> 37:42.552
WITH A PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICH,

37:42.594 --> 37:44.930
JUST WAITING FOR THE FAIRY

37:42.594 --> 37:44.930
TO GET HUNGRY.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.973
OKAY. NEW STORY.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.517
I'M STILL CRUSHED

37:47.015 --> 37:49.517
BEYOND BELIEF

37:49.559 --> 37:51.436
THAT SHE QUIT

37:49.559 --> 37:51.436

37:51.477 --> 37:54.189
OH, NOT ME.

37:51.477 --> 37:54.189
MISS "PERFECT WORK ETHIC"

WOULD PRANCE AROUND THIS ROOM

37:54.231 --> 37:57.234
24 HOURS A DAY.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.568
AND I STILL STUNK.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.861
I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.029
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

38:01.071 --> 38:03.031
SHE WAS PRETTY BAD.

38:03.073 --> 38:06.993
DON'T YOU LISTEN TO THEM.

FROM RORY'S OLD BABY CLOTHES.

38:28.473 --> 38:31.392
HOW NICE.

38:28.473 --> 38:31.392
I HOPE YOU WASHED THEM FIRST.

38:31.434 --> 38:34.020
OH, RATS.

38:31.434 --> 38:34.020
I KNEW I FORGOT SOMETHING.

WHICH WAS HOW?

39:05.384 --> 39:07.887
LIKE YOU WERE ABOUT TO GIVE HIM

LIKE A PORTERHOUSE STEAK.

39:17.272 --> 39:19.191
I'M SMILING

39:17.272 --> 39:19.191
BECAUSE YOU'RE CRAZY

39:19.232 --> 39:22.277
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO TO

39:19.232 --> 39:22.277
CRAZY PEOPLE TO KEEP THEM CALM.

39:42.588 --> 39:45.633
TOOK A VERY UGLY TURN.

39:45.675 --> 39:47.468
THE GOOD THING WAS

39:45.675 --> 39:47.468
THAT I BROUGHT

39:47.510 --> 39:49.929
PRETZEL CHICK DOWN WITH ME.

39:49.971 --> 39:53.516
I'VE SINCE LEARNED THAT I'M

39:49.971 --> 39:53.516
