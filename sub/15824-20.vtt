WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.172
DISPATCHER:
All units be advised.

00:04.205 --> 00:06.207
We have shots fired
and an officer down.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.475
We need tactical support

00:07.508 --> 00:09.477
on the 3600 block
of MacGregor Drive

00:09.510 --> 00:11.145
in Northridge.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.581
Air 5, who is responding
to the MacGregor Drive call?

00:13.614 --> 00:14.782
We've got 60 seconds.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.751
OFFICER: 17-835.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.453
I'll be on the scene
in 15 seconds.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.821
Any suspect descriptions?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.324
DISPATCHER #2:
No description given.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.193
835.
Show me code six.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.131
There we go. Right there.
South curb.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.365
Lying down, south curb.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.240
Okay, we got him
right there.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.708
We got him under the light.
I got him right here.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.722
Provenza: BOBBY.
PROVENZA.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.424
HE'S NOT A COP.
YOU'RE KIDDING.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.791
NEIGHBOR CALLED IT IN.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.860
MUST HAVE BEEN CONFUSED
BY THE UNIFORM.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.600
LOOKS LIKE HE WAS WORKING
PRIVATE SECURITY.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.270
POOR KID.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.804
ALL RIGHT, BOBBY.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.440
GET ON THE RADIO.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.275
LET EVERYONE KNOW
THERE'S NOT AN OFFICER DOWN.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.245
AND THIS SECURITY CAR OVER HERE
MUST BELONG TO THE VICTIM,

01:17.278 --> 01:18.812
SO TAPE IT OFF.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.448
LET'S GET A PERIMETER
SET UP, HUH?

01:20.481 --> 01:23.184
Bobby: CODE 4 ON MacGREGOR.
NOT AN OFFICER.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.219
REPEAT. NOT AN OFFICER.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.789
PILOT:
He's waving us off.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.391
WE STILL GONNA TAKE
THIS CASE?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.293
I'M UP. I'M DRESSED.

01:32.326 --> 01:35.629
I'M MAKING TIME-AND-A-HALF.
LET'S GO.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.311
OKAY, THE I.D. SAYS
OUR SECURITY GUARD'S NAME IS,

01:50.344 --> 01:51.512
UH, DANNY CHAIDEZ.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.813
WISH I COULD CONFIRM THAT
FOR SURE,

01:52.846 --> 01:54.615
BUT THE SHOTGUN
TOOK OUT MOST OF HIS FACE.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.916
CLOSE RANGE, TOO --

01:55.949 --> 01:57.485
ABOUT 10 FEET.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.688
I GOT A SHELL CASING
FROM A 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN, SIR.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.591
LOOKS LIKE THE SHOOTER
APPROACHED ON FOOT

02:03.624 --> 02:05.259
FROM ACROSS THE LAWN.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.161
OUR VICTIM TURNED -- BOOM.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.562
SO IT WASN'T A DRIVE-BY.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.232
NO, SIR. I JUST SPOKE
WITH THE LADY WHO CALLED 911.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.601
ACCORDING TO HER, SHE HEARD
THE SHOT, LOOKED OUT HER WINDOW,

02:13.634 --> 02:15.836
SAW WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS
A DEAD COP LYING ON THE GROUND,

02:15.869 --> 02:17.671
BUT NO ONE FLEEING THE SCENE,
ALTHOUGH IT SMELLS LIKE

02:17.705 --> 02:19.873
SHE'S BEEN HITTING
THE CHARDONNAY PRETTY HARD.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.409
GREAT. NO WITNESSES.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.443
GENTLEMEN.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.911
AH. DDA BALDWIN.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.414
I'M AFRAID IT WAS A BIT
OF A WASTED TRIP FOR YOU.

02:26.447 --> 02:29.250
TURNS OUT THAT THIS MURDER
IS NOT AN OFFICER DOWN.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.352
I HEARD THAT ON THE RADIO CALL.
ARE YOU SURE IT'S A MURDER?

02:31.385 --> 02:34.355
WELL, I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY
LIKE YOU, OF COURSE,

02:34.388 --> 02:35.889
BUT WE FOUND THE GUY

02:35.923 --> 02:37.891
LYING IN THE STREET
WITH HIS FACE BLOWN AWAY.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.360
SO, YEAH.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.229
YEAH, I'M COMFORTABLE
CALLING IT MURDER.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.330
WHY?

02:42.363 --> 02:43.897
THE VICTIM'S
CARRYING A GUN.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.235
Flynn: WELL, HIS, UH, HOLSTER
IS STILL SNAPPED.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.736
SO THAT MEANS
HE NEVER DREW HIS WEAPON.

02:48.769 --> 02:49.803
HE WAS AMBUSHED, MA'AM.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.272
UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE

02:51.305 --> 02:53.607
CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE
TO THE CONTRARY,

02:53.641 --> 02:54.975
WHEN WE MAKE OUR ARREST,

02:55.008 --> 02:56.544
THE SUSPECT'S ATTORNEY
WILL CLAIM SELF-DEFENSE.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.646
HAVE YOU, UH, CANVASSED
FOR WITNESSES?

02:58.679 --> 03:00.914
DOES RACR HAVE RELATED
ASSAULTS IN THIS AREA
OR IS IT JUST --

03:00.948 --> 03:04.252
YOU KNOW, T-T-THOSE ARE
ALL GREAT QUESTIONS.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.853
WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK
IN YOUR CAR

03:05.886 --> 03:06.954
AND WRITE THEM
ALL OUT FOR ME?

03:06.987 --> 03:08.589
CHIEF POPE WANTS ME HERE.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.759
AND YOU CAN STAY,
JUST NOT INSIDE MY CRIME SCENE.

03:11.792 --> 03:12.960
LIEUTENANT, LOOK, I --

03:12.993 --> 03:15.363
AH! AH! AH!

03:15.396 --> 03:18.532
I'M TELLING YOU,
AS THE INCIDENT COMMANDER,

03:18.566 --> 03:23.237
STAND OVER THERE.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.612
WHAT DO YOU GOT, MIKE?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.514
I JUST TALKED TO
THE SECURITY COMPANY'S DISPATCH.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.484
THE SUPERVISOR SAID
OUR VICTIM, DANNY CHAIDEZ,

03:36.517 --> 03:40.688
CALLED IN A SUSPICIOUS-ACTIVITY
REPORT AT 12:48 A.M.,

03:40.721 --> 03:43.291
A POSSIBLE BREAK-IN
AT AN EMPTY HOUSE.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.859
3631 MacGREGOR.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.995
RIGHT OVER THERE.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.267
POLICE!
L.A.P.D.!

03:53.301 --> 03:55.035
OPEN DOOR ON THE LEFT!
DOOR ON MY LEFT.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.770
BATHROOM, RIGHT.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.339
AROUND THE CORNER!

03:58.372 --> 03:59.507
CLEAR!

03:59.540 --> 04:01.041
WE'RE CLEAR!

04:01.074 --> 04:03.444
CLEAR!

04:03.477 --> 04:05.946
HEY, BUZZ! COME ON IN.
IT'S ALL CLEAR.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.948
Gabriel:
HEY, GUYS. IN HERE.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.623
OKAY.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.024
LOOK AT THIS, BUZZ.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.993
WE GOT AN iPOD
ON A BATTERY-OPERATED DOCK HERE.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.330
Buzz: AND A SLEEPING BAG
FOR TWO.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.564
SOMEBODY
WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.533
Sanchez: FORENSICS,
GET THIS ASHTRAY.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.834
Flynn:
BUZZ, CHECK THIS OUT.

04:26.867 --> 04:31.305
A PINK BRA
AND A 12-PACK OF CONDOMS.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.006
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
OPTIMISM.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.410
I ALSO FOUND SOME EMPTY CONDOM
WRAPPERS IN THE BATHROOM

04:36.444 --> 04:38.612
AND A LOT
OF BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.618
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.421
I BELIEVE WE'VE MAXIMIZED
OUR DNA POTENTIAL.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.789
THAT'S EVEN MORE DISGUSTING.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.991
AND THIS iPOD
HAS A BUNCH OF MUSIC ON IT,

04:51.024 --> 04:54.795
INCLUDING A FILE THAT SAYS
"SLOW JAM LOVE MIX,"

04:54.828 --> 04:56.597
BUT, UH, NO PHOTOS.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.466
CANNABIS, CANDLES,
AND CONDOMS.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.767
SOUNDS LIKE YOUNG ROMANCE.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.101
WHEN YOU PUT IT
TO MUSIC, YEAH.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.337
AND I'M LOOKING
AT THE SETTINGS HERE,

05:03.371 --> 05:05.939
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS BELONGED
TO SOMEONE NAMED LUKE.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.809
LUKE WHO?

05:08.842 --> 05:11.679
UH, SORRY.
IT JUST SAYS "LUKE'S MUSIC."

05:11.712 --> 05:13.347
I'LL, UH, I'LL TRACE
THE SERIAL NUMBER,

05:13.381 --> 05:14.915
SEE IF I CAN FIND WHO BOUGHT IT
AND WHERE.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.684
SO, THE OPERATING THEORY
WOULD BE THAT THIS LUKE

05:16.717 --> 05:19.052
AND WHOEVER ELSE WAS
IN THE HOUSE PARTYING WITH HIM

05:19.086 --> 05:21.422
MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED
IN THE SHOOTING LAST NIGHT

05:21.455 --> 05:22.690
OR AT LEAST WITNESSED IT.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.592
I-IS THERE ANY OTHER
BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS THING

05:24.625 --> 05:26.460
YOU WOULD LIKE
TO POINT OUT TO US?

05:26.494 --> 05:29.497
DO YOU KNOW IF OUR VICTIM EVER
WENT INSIDE THE HOUSE HIMSELF?

05:29.530 --> 05:32.600
FOUND THE KEY TO THE DOOR
IN HIS BACK POCKET, MA'AM.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.368
HAVING THE KEY
DOESN'T MEAN HE USED IT.

05:34.402 --> 05:36.537
THERE ARE PROBABLY
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE AREA

05:36.570 --> 05:38.005
WHO KNEW
THE HOUSE WAS VACANT.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.741
WE SHOULD PROBABLY TALK
TO THE ESTATE AGENT

05:40.774 --> 05:42.510
AND THE BANK OFFICERS,
IN ADDITION TO EVERYONE

05:42.543 --> 05:43.911
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
JUST TO RULE OUT --

05:43.944 --> 05:46.414
CLAIRE.
CLAIRE. EXCUSE ME.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.517
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE
SPEAKING TO AN ACADEMY CLASS?

05:50.984 --> 05:53.654
LIEUTENANT, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER OR NOT

05:53.687 --> 05:54.855
HE USED HIS WEAPON,

05:54.888 --> 05:56.724
THE VICTIM WAS ARMED,

05:56.757 --> 05:59.026
AND THE KILLER WILL SAY HE WAS
APPROACHED WITH DEADLY FORCE

05:59.059 --> 06:00.594
AND ACTED
IN FEAR OF HIS LIFE.

06:00.628 --> 06:04.097
SO, WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT MR. CHAIDEZ?

06:04.131 --> 06:07.735
25, NO CRIMINAL RECORD,
NO GANG AFFILIATIONS,

06:07.768 --> 06:09.603
AND HE WAS A WAR HERO,
MA'AM.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.871
A WAR HERO?

06:10.904 --> 06:13.774
SERGEANT CHAIDEZ
SERVED 18 MONTHS IN IRAQ

06:13.807 --> 06:16.076
AND IN THREE TOURS OF DUTY
IN AFGHANISTAN,

06:16.109 --> 06:19.447
AND HE WAS AWARDED THE SILVER
STAR FOR GALLANTRY IN KANDAHAR.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.650
ONLY TO BE SHOT DOWN
IN THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.587
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT
AT ALL.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.723
CHIEF JOHNSON, I, UH,
THOUGHT YOU WERE IN ATLANTA.

06:29.757 --> 06:30.891
I WAS.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.495
WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.598
AND THANKS SO MUCH,
THE REST OF YOU,

06:37.631 --> 06:43.937
FOR ALL THE FLOWERS
AND...FOOD AND...CARDS

06:43.971 --> 06:45.473
THAT YOU SENT MY FAMILY.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.608
WE WERE SO GRATEFUL
FOR ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS

06:47.641 --> 06:49.176
YOU WROTE ABOUT MY MOTHER.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.912
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA, MAY I SPEAK
WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT?

06:51.945 --> 06:53.113
CERTAINLY.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.682
THANK YOU.
AND, UH, DDA BALDWIN,

06:54.715 --> 06:57.050
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
WE APPRECIATE YOUR HELP.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.187
WE'LL BE SURE TO UPDATE YOU JUST
AS SOON AS WE'VE MADE AN ARREST.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.824
I'M SURE
YOU KNOW THE WAY OUT.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.728
WHAT IS BALDWIN DOING HERE?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.730
UH, ASK POPE, NOT ME.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.665
WAS SHE RUNNING
MY MURDER ROOM?

07:11.699 --> 07:13.467
NO. NO, SHE WASN'T.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.202
JUST
SOME BUREAUCRATIC B.S.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.605
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.540
Y-YOU DO NOT NEED
TO BE HERE, CHIEF.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.808
OUR VICTIM
IS A DECORATED VETERAN.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.676
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHERE I NEED TO BE.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.245
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO
COME BACK FROM ATLANTA
TILL NEXT MONTH.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.714
ALL MY BROTHERS ARE THERE,

07:26.747 --> 07:28.115
THREE AUNTS, TWO UNCLES,
NEPHEWS, NIECES.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.183
THERE ISN'T EVEN
A PLACE TO PARK

07:30.217 --> 07:32.219
IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS' HOUSE
RIGHT NOW.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.854
IT'S LATER
I NEED TO THINK ABOUT --

07:33.887 --> 07:36.890
WHEN MY FATHER'S
ALL ALONE.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.126
SO, PLEASE, JUST, UH...

07:39.159 --> 07:41.161
FILL ME IN ON THIS CASE.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.930
WHAT'S OUR STRONGEST LEAD?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.766
AN iPOD LEFT AT THE SCENE.

07:45.799 --> 07:46.734
OWNED BY?

07:46.767 --> 07:48.268
CAROLYN LOWITZ.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.837
CAROLYN

07:49.870 --> 07:52.540
NO. ACCORDING TO THE RECEIPT
AND THE SERIAL NUMBER,

07:52.573 --> 07:55.876
CAROLYN LOWITZ BOUGHT THAT iPOD
AT THE GROVE IN MAY.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.077
MAYBE IT WAS, UH,
A GIFT FOR LUKE.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.512
OR HE STOLE IT.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.581
DO WE HAVE AN ADDRESS
FOR MS. LOWITZ?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.950
NO, I'M STILL WAITING
ON AN E-MAIL FROM THE
CREDIT-CARD COMPANY.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.018
IT SHOULD BE HERE
ANY SECOND.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.621
CHIEF JOHNSON.
HOW ARE YOU?

08:07.655 --> 08:10.290
WE DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
BACK AT WORK SO SOON.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.925
YOU JUST HERE FOR THE DAY
OR DO YOU --

08:11.959 --> 08:13.894
NO, NO. I'M BACK AT WORK.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.529
AND W--

08:16.196 --> 08:18.966
UH, I-I'VE GOT A SERIOUS
PUBLIC-SAFETY ISSUE

08:18.999 --> 08:20.834
IN FRONT OF ME, SO...

08:20.868 --> 08:22.603
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

08:22.636 --> 08:24.204
WILL YOU BE TAKING YOUR ENTIRE
DIVISION OUT WITH YOU?

08:24.237 --> 08:26.640
THAT WAS THE PLAN.
HOW LONG
WILL YOU BE GONE?

08:26.674 --> 08:30.277
WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON HOW LONG
THE SUSPECT TAKES TO APPREHEND.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.779
IS THERE ANYONE
IN PARTICULAR

08:31.812 --> 08:33.146
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE US
TO LEAVE BEHIND?

08:33.180 --> 08:35.282
CHIEF, GOT AN ADDRESS
FOR CAROLYN LOWITZ.

08:35.315 --> 08:38.652
DO YOU MIND IF WE PAY
MS. LOWITZ A CALL?
SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.855
SHE'S, UH, LIVING IN A HIGHLY
POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD, CHIEF.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.256
OH, GOOD POINT.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.125
Y-YOU KNOW, E-EVEN IF
SHE ISN'T OUR KILLER,

08:45.158 --> 08:47.828
WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE,
YOU KNOW, UH, EXTRA CAREFUL

08:47.861 --> 08:49.229
IN HOW WE APPROACH
MS. LOWITZ.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.832
Taylor:
THE LAST THING WE NEED

08:51.865 --> 08:54.167
IS TO INCUR CIVILIAN CASUALTIES
DURING A MANHUNT,

08:54.201 --> 08:57.638
AND WE ALL KNOW THE SUSPECT
COULD BE ARMED,

08:57.671 --> 08:59.773
SO IF ANYONE
STARTS SHOOTING...

08:59.807 --> 09:01.174
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES,

09:01.208 --> 09:02.910
LET'S MAKE A BIG PRODUCTION
OUT OF IT, THEN.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.111
CHIEF POPE,
I HAVE A SPECIAL REQUEST.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.278
UH, SO HAVE I.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.614
WOULD YOU COME WITH ME,
PLEASE?

09:06.647 --> 09:08.281
EXCUSE US, EVERYONE.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.859
Pope: WHY ARE YOU
EVEN AT WORK TODAY?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.928
I'M TRYING TO FIND THE PERSON
WHO MURDERED A WAR HERO.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.096
WITH DDA BALDWIN
LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER,

09:23.130 --> 09:24.898
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO DO THAT?

09:24.932 --> 09:26.900
BY STAYING HOME.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.703
MY SPECIAL REQUEST,
IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT,

09:29.737 --> 09:32.940
IS THAT YOU TAKE YOUR FULL THREE
WEEKS OF BEREAVEMENT LEAVE.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.908
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT
RIGHT NOW.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.077
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY
EVEN BEING HERE?

09:37.110 --> 09:39.146
YES, I'M FINE.
I'D RATHER NOT DISCUSS IT.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.115
OKAY. OKAY, THIS IS
A PERSONAL MATTER,

09:42.149 --> 09:45.118
SO I'M NOT GONNA ORDER YOU
TO GO HOME.

09:45.152 --> 09:48.221
YOU COULD ORDER BALDWIN
TO STAY OUT OF MY MURDER ROOM

09:48.255 --> 09:50.123
TILL I CALL HER.
WELL, NO,
I CAN'T DO THAT, EITHER.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.225
OKAY. I SEE THAT YOU WANT
A DEPUTY D.A.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.362
ATTACHED TO MAJOR CRIMES, BUT
WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY.

09:55.395 --> 09:58.031
BECAUSE IT'S THE COMPROMISE
I MADE

09:58.065 --> 10:00.668
TO KEEP MAJOR CRIMES
UP AND RUNNING.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.973
AND TO KEEP ME?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.641
YEAH.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.409
AND IT'S WHY MY POSITION
AS ASSISTANT CHIEF

10:09.442 --> 10:13.180
WILL NOW BE TAKEN BY TAYLOR
INSTEAD OF YOU.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.717
BELIEVE ME, YOU --
YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT JOB.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.787
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT
ALL THESE COMPROMISES BEFORE?

10:24.224 --> 10:25.893
WELL...

10:29.396 --> 10:31.865
...I WAS AFRAID
YOU MIGHT QUIT.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.400
PLUS, YOU WERE
REALLY MAD AT ME.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.204
AND THEN YOUR MOM...DIED,

10:37.237 --> 10:39.339
AND, UH, YOU'VE BEEN
UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE

10:39.372 --> 10:41.709
BECAUSE OF THE LEAK
IN YOUR DIVISION,

10:41.742 --> 10:44.011
AND I GUESS WHILE
WE'RE GETTING THE BAD NEWS OUT,

10:44.044 --> 10:45.412
WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET IT ALL OUT.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.781
RAYDOR THINKS SHE'S FINALLY
FIGURED OUT WHO THAT IS.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.918
WE WERE GONNA MANAGE THAT TODAY
WHILE YOU WERE STILL GONE,

10:50.951 --> 10:53.153
BUT IF YOU'RE DETERMINED
TO STAY --

10:53.186 --> 10:55.255
I AM. WHO IS IT?
WHO'S THE LEAK?

10:55.288 --> 10:58.125
NO, NO, NO. SHE STILL HAS
MORE STATEMENTS TO TAKE,

10:58.158 --> 11:00.060
BUT BY THIS AFTERNOON --

11:00.093 --> 11:01.795
SO, YOU KNOW WHO IT IS?

11:01.829 --> 11:03.430
I JUST SAID WE'LL HAVE
THIS FIGURED OUT LATER TODAY.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.198
RAYDOR HAS TO DO THIS
BY THE RULES.

11:05.232 --> 11:09.970
NOW, YOU SAY YOU WANT TO WORK,
AND YOU HAVE A SPECIAL REQUEST.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.104
WHAT IS IT?

11:11.138 --> 11:13.073
YES.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.476
UM, I NEED, UM,
10 S.I.S. OFFICERS,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.345
SEVERAL PATROL CARS,

11:18.378 --> 11:22.015
AND TACTICAL SUPPORT
FROM SPECIAL OPERATIONS.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.117
CONSIDERING OUR RIDICULOUSLY
LIMITED RESOURCES,

11:24.151 --> 11:25.919
DO YOU HAVE
AN INCREDIBLY GOOD REASON

11:25.953 --> 11:27.988
FOR ORDERING AN EXPENSIVE
ROLL

11:28.021 --> 11:29.823
I DO.

11:31.058 --> 11:34.127
I NEED TO RETURN
SOMEONE'S iPOD.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.198
YOO-HOO!
MS. LOWITZ?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.267
MS. CAROLYN LOWITZ?

11:40.300 --> 11:41.869
HI. YES?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.837
UH, MY NAME IS DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON,

11:43.871 --> 11:45.939
AND, UH, THIS IS
DETECTIVE DAVID GABRIEL.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.007
MAY WE COME IN?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.341
SURE.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.811
THANK YOU.

11:50.844 --> 11:54.047
WE'RE FROM
THE L.A.P.D. THEFT DIVISION,

11:54.081 --> 11:55.448
AND WE'VE GOT GREAT NEWS.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.118
IT'S "RETURNING
STOLEN PROPERTY" WEEK.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.087
IT'S KIND OF
A COMMUNITY-OUTREACH THING.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.223
AND ACCORDING
TO OUR RECORDS,

12:03.256 --> 12:06.794
YOU PURCHASED THIS iPOD
IN MAY,

12:06.827 --> 12:08.161
AND WE JUST RECENTLY
RECOVERED IT.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.063
OH, THIS MUST BE LUKE'S.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.399
LUKE

12:12.432 --> 12:14.001
MY GRANDSON, LUKE BAUER.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.435
I BOUGHT THIS FOR HIM
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.371
OKAY, SO, THIS IS, LIKE,
A HIGH

12:18.405 --> 12:20.107
NO.
FOR HIS 23rd BIRTHDAY.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.975
OH, GOD.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.211
THAT WAS STOLEN.
LUKE WASN'T HURT, WAS HE?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.246
OH, NO, NO. NOT AT ALL.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.148
A-AND DO YOU KNOW
WHERE LUKE IS RIGHT NOW?

12:32.452 --> 12:33.954
HE'S NOT HERE.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.556
ALL UNITS, STAND DOWN.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.025
WE'RE MOVING
TO A NEW LOCATION.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.426
WE HAVE A FULL NAME
ON OUR SUSPECT.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.994
LUKE BAUER, AGE 23.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.897
HE'S TO BE CONSIDERED
ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.899
OKAY, EVERYONE.
GATHER IN.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.868
HE'S AT RUN N' GUN
SPORTING GOODS

12:47.901 --> 12:49.970
ON THE CORNER OF VICTORY
AND RESEDA.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.139
GOT IT? LET'S GO.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.287
OH. YOU FOUND THEM.
OF COURSE I DID.

13:07.320 --> 13:12.225
TRUST ME, I'M GONNA MAKE
YOUR FEET FEEL GREAT.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.582
LUKE BAUER, I BELIEVE
THIS BELONGS TO YOU.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.250
YOU GOT THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.286
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

13:39.319 --> 13:40.520
IN A COURT OF LAW.

13:40.553 --> 13:41.889
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.424
Brenda: OKAY, LUKE.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.860
NOW...

13:46.894 --> 13:49.262
THE ONLY THING
THAT I KNOW ABOUT YOU

13:49.296 --> 13:51.064
BESIDES YOUR TASTE
IN MUSIC

13:51.098 --> 13:53.433
IS THAT YOU LIKE TO BREAK
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.268
I DON'T BREAK
INTO PEOPLE'S HOUSES.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.037
REALLY?

13:57.070 --> 13:59.339
YOU WERE ARRESTED FOR JUST
THAT VERY THING LAST YEAR.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.474
THAT WAS MY MOM'S HOUSE!
SHE DROPPED THE CHARGES.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.878
YEAH, BUT NOT BEFORE THE POLICE
FOUND YOU WITH A DAGGER,

14:04.912 --> 14:08.448
KUNG FU STICKS,
SOMETHING CALLED A DIRK KNIFE,

14:08.481 --> 14:09.950
AND THERE'S
A SECOND PAGE HERE.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.152
OH, LOOK, CHIEF --
A SHOTGUN.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.421
THAT'S A LOT OF WEAPONS
TO BE CARRYING AROUND, LUKE.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.523
PREPARING FOR ARMAGEDDON?
NO.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.491
THOSE ARE ALL ANTIQUES
LEFT TO ME BY MY FATHER.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.260
MY MOTHER DIDN'T WANT ME
TO HAVE THEM,

14:20.293 --> 14:22.395
AND I GOT TIRED OF WAITING,
SO I DECIDED TO TAKE THEM.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.464
AND THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED
THE SECOND AMENDMENT

14:24.497 --> 14:26.466
WHICH SAYS IT'S OKAY FOR ME
TO HAVE ALL THAT STUFF.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.401
WHY DON'T YOU READ
THE CONSTITUTION, ASSHOLE?

14:29.669 --> 14:31.905
DID OUR FOUNDING FATHERS
ALSO ENDOW YOU

14:31.939 --> 14:33.306
WITH THE INALIENABLE RIGHT

14:33.340 --> 14:35.442
TO HAVE SEX
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES?

14:35.475 --> 14:38.078
LOOKS LIKE YOU MADE
QUITE A PARTY OUT OF IT, LUKE.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.081
A SLEEPING BAG,
POT, BEER.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.450
I DIDN'T BREAK IN,
AND IT WASN'T A PARTY.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.319
NO. IT WAS A MURDER.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.190
I DON'T...

14:50.223 --> 14:51.558
I DON'T...

14:51.591 --> 14:53.093
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS GUY?

14:53.126 --> 14:57.430
HMM. MAYBE HE'D BE EASIER
TO RECOGNIZE FOR YOU

14:57.464 --> 14:58.999
WITH A FACE.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.568
HIS NAME IS DANNY CHAIDEZ.
HE WAS A VETERAN.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.471
JUST RETURNED FROM SERVING
IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.638
YOU MET MR. CHAIDEZ

15:05.672 --> 15:07.407
JUST MOMENTS
BEFORE HIS FACE

15:07.440 --> 15:09.176
WAS BLOWN OFF WITH A SHOTGUN,
AND GUESS WHO OWNS ONE.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.045
I DIDN'T SHOOT THIS GUY.
I SWEAR.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.680
WE KNOW
YOU WERE IN THAT HOUSE,

15:13.713 --> 15:15.482
AND WE KNOW
YOU WERE NOT ALONE.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.017
OH, MAN. OH, MAN.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.218
Brenda:
WHO WERE YOU WITH?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.320
WE JUST...

15:20.353 --> 15:22.089
I WAS JUST LOOKING
FOR A PLACE TO HANG OUT.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.423
NO, NO.
YOU JUST SAID "WE."

15:23.456 --> 15:24.992
WHO WAS "WE"?

15:25.025 --> 15:27.027
YOU WERE WITH SOMEONE.
WHO WAS IT?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.996
YOU'RE ON PROBATION,
LUKE,

15:29.029 --> 15:30.197
SO I DON'T EVEN NEED
A WARRANT

15:30.230 --> 15:31.564
TO SEARCH YOUR HOUSE
OR YOUR CAR.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.600
AND WHEN I FIND A WEAPON
OF ANY KIND OR DRUGS,

15:33.633 --> 15:35.335
YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY
BACK IN COURT.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.337
I WAS WITH
MY GIRLFRIEND, OKAY?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.172
OKAY. WHAT'S HER NAME?

15:39.206 --> 15:41.208
JENNA.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.210
BATEMAN.
JENNA BATEMAN.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.113
LOOK, THE ONLY REASON
WE WERE IN THAT HOUSE

15:46.146 --> 15:48.115
WAS BECAUSE I'VE GOT
THREE ROOMMATES RIGHT NOW,

15:48.148 --> 15:50.683
AND WE NEVER KNOW WHEN
JENNA'S DAD'S GONNA BE HOME --

15:50.717 --> 15:52.652
JENNA'S DAD?!

15:52.685 --> 15:54.121
HOW OLD IS SHE?

15:55.388 --> 15:58.025
WE FOUND DNA
ALL OVER THAT HOUSE.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.692
IF YOU'RE SHUTTLING IN
LITTLE GIRLS --

15:59.726 --> 16:01.594
SHE IS NOT A LITTLE GIRL!

16:01.628 --> 16:03.263
SHE'LL BE 17
IN LIKE A MONTH!

16:03.296 --> 16:07.400
UH-HUH. TELL ME, HAVE YOU
EVER HEARD OF STATUTORY RAPE?

16:07.434 --> 16:09.702
THAT WOULD BE
WHEN YOU HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE

16:09.736 --> 16:11.204
UNDER THE AGE OF CONSENT.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.605
AND, YOU KNOW,
IF WE ADD THAT

16:12.639 --> 16:15.042
TO THE BREAKING-AND-ENTERING
CHARGE FROM LAST NIGHT,

16:15.075 --> 16:16.609
YOU'RE SWINGING
AT STRIKE THREE, BUDDY.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.345
NO. NO.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.081
LOOK, THIS WAS ALL JENNA'S IDEA
TO GO IN THIS HOUSE.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.782
IT WASN'T MINE.
SHE HAD A KEY.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.384
WE HAD
JUST WENT IN THERE TO --

16:24.417 --> 16:26.419
WE WERE JUST HANGING OUT!

16:26.453 --> 16:28.121
AND THEN MR. RENT-A-COP
SHOWS UP

16:28.155 --> 16:30.090
AND TELLS US TO GET LOST
BEFORE HE CALLS THE COPS.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.358
SO I TOOK OFF.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.393
YOU TOOK OFF?
WHERE DID JENNA GO?

16:33.426 --> 16:35.295
I DON'T KNOW.
HOME, I GUESS.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.663
WHAT'S HER ADDRESS?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.031
WE'D LIKE TO CHECK
ON HER.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.766
FOREST DRIVE --

16:39.799 --> 16:41.468
1015 FOREST DRIVE.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.370
OKAY.
IT'S RIGHT
AROUND THE CORNER...

16:43.403 --> 16:45.405
I'M GONNA GET A SEARCH WARRANT
FOR THIS LITTLE DIRTBAG'S HOME.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.607
I'LL GO
PICK UP THE GIRL.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.111
THE GUY WAS ALIVE
WHEN WE LEFT. I SWEAR IT.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.445
OH, UH, SHE'S 16.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.613
WELL, TELL
THE YOUNG MISS JENNA

16:53.646 --> 16:55.148
WHAT WE FOUND
IN THE PARTY HOUSE,

16:55.182 --> 16:56.616
AND THEN ASK HER
IF SHE WANTS TO COME IN

16:56.649 --> 16:58.551
WITH OR WITHOUT
HER PARENTS.
MM-HMM.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.353
Gabriel: MAYBE DANNY
THREATENED YOU. HE WAS ARMED.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.455
NO, LOOK, I TOLD YOU
THE WHOLE STORY.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.491
DANNY...
WHATEVER HIS NAME WAS,

17:04.524 --> 17:08.328
HE TOLD US TO LEAVE,
AND WE LEFT.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.178
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:25.212 --> 17:28.381
I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH DETECTIVE GABRIEL.

17:28.415 --> 17:32.752
EXCUSE ME, DETECTIVE.
COME WITH ME, PLEASE.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.654
CHIEF POPE
IS EXPECTING US.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.094
CHIEF?

17:41.128 --> 17:43.330
GO ON.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.723
BEFORE WE BEGIN
THIS MEETING,

18:10.757 --> 18:12.759
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

18:12.792 --> 18:15.528
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEETING
IS ABOUT, CAPTAIN.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.797
OKAY.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.500
SO, BEFORE WE START,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

18:20.533 --> 18:23.736
THAT I'M REALLY SORRY
WE HAVE TO DO THINGS THIS WAY.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.139
DO WHAT THINGS?
I DON'T -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.178
ANN?

18:31.211 --> 18:32.879
DAVID, I AM SO SORRY.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.247
SORRY FOR WHAT?
WHAT

18:34.281 --> 18:36.216
HAVE A SEAT, DETECTIVE.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.589
DETECTIVE, ARE YOU AWARE
THAT DURING THE TIME

18:42.622 --> 18:44.824
PETER GOLDMAN WAS SUING
THE L.A.P.D.,

18:44.857 --> 18:46.659
HE WAS PAYING THE WOMAN
YOU'RE LIVING WITH

18:46.693 --> 18:49.128
FOR INFORMATION
ABOUT MAJOR CRIMES?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.702
SHE'S NOT WORKING
FOR GOLDMAN.

18:55.735 --> 18:56.869
SHE JUST FINISHED
LAW SCHOOL.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.305
SHE'S STUDYING
TO TAKE THE BAR.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.606
I'M HELPING HER STUDY
TO TAKE THE BAR.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.708
HOW COULD SHE
BE WORKING FOR GOLDMAN?

19:01.741 --> 19:03.676
Raydor: MR. GOLDMAN SHARES
RECEPTION AND OFFICE PERSONNEL

19:03.710 --> 19:05.345
WITH SEVERAL
OTHER LAW FIRMS,

19:05.378 --> 19:08.681
ONE OF WHICH USED ANN
LAST SUMMER AS AN INTERN.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.317
SHE'S ALREADY ADMITTED

19:10.350 --> 19:13.720
THAT IN EXCHANGE
FOR GETTING TO KNOW YOU,

19:13.753 --> 19:18.358
GOLDMAN PAID OFF $60,000
OF HER STUDENT LOANS.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.194
BUT HOW COULD -- LOOK,
THIS -- THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.296
SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
TO TELL GOLDMAN.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.765
I WOULDN'T BE
SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.800
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
WHEN I MET HER,

19:27.834 --> 19:29.536
I WAS STRUCK
WHEN YOU TOLD ME

19:29.569 --> 19:32.272
THAT ANN GIVES YOU
HER POINT OF VIEW ON EVERYTHING.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.741
I WONDERED IF "EVERYTHING"
INCLUDED YOUR WORK

19:34.774 --> 19:37.744
AND YOUR PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS
OF THE CASES

19:37.777 --> 19:39.579
WE WERE BEING SUED FOR
IN COURT.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.981
FOR EXAMPLE,
EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARS

19:42.014 --> 19:43.783
AS IF NO LAWS
WERE BROKEN,

19:43.816 --> 19:46.419
WE ALL HAVE DOUBTS
ABOUT THE WAY CHIEF JOHNSON

19:46.453 --> 19:48.588
SETTLED AFFAIRS
WITH TURELL BAYLOR.

19:48.621 --> 19:52.692
DID YOU SHARE YOUR DOUBTS
WITH ANN?

19:55.962 --> 19:59.232
BUT WE -- WE MET
WHEN SHE JOINED MY CHURCH.

19:59.266 --> 20:02.235
I THINK
THAT WAS THE PLAN, DAVID.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.673
YOU WERE -- YOU WERE PAID
TO MEET ME AT CHURCH?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.508
YOU CAME TO MY CHURCH?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.643
SO, THE SUNDAY THAT WE MET

20:10.677 --> 20:12.579
AND YOU CAME UP
AND INTRODUCED YOURSELF TO ME

20:12.612 --> 20:14.547
AND SAID THAT YOU NEEDED
LEGAL ADVICE,

20:14.581 --> 20:16.449
THAT WAS ALL
PART OF SOME PLAN?

20:16.483 --> 20:17.784
Pope:
I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT,

20:17.817 --> 20:19.752
BUT LET'S TRY NOT
TO STRAY OFF THE SUBJECT.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.489
THIS IS --
THIS IS NOT A SUBJECT!

20:22.522 --> 20:24.891
THIS IS NOT A SUBJECT!
THIS IS -- THIS IS MY LIFE!

20:24.924 --> 20:26.493
THIS IS MY EVERYTHING!

20:26.526 --> 20:28.695
ANN, HOW -- HOW COULD
YOU DO THIS TO ME?!

20:28.728 --> 20:30.730
GOLDMAN TOLD ME
YOU WERE A CROOKED COP

20:30.763 --> 20:32.665
AND THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED
IN A MURDER.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.867
AND, DAVID -- DAVID, LOOK,
AS SOON AS I KNEW

20:34.901 --> 20:37.604
YOU WEREN'T WHAT HE SAID
AND THAT I HAD FEELINGS FOR YOU,

20:37.637 --> 20:39.372
REAL FEELINGS,
I WANTED TO QUIT!

20:39.406 --> 20:41.841
AND -- AND I TRIED TO KEEP YOU
FROM BEING SUBPOENAED.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.710
DO YOU --
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.945
YOU WEREN'T SUBPOENAED AT
THE SAME TIME AS EVERYONE ELSE.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.747
BUT PETER SAID THAT --
"PETER SAID"?

20:47.780 --> 20:49.916
YOU'RE CALLING
THAT SON OF A BITCH "PETER"?

20:52.385 --> 20:54.921
PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT PETER SAID.

20:57.790 --> 21:01.728
HE SAID THAT IF I DIDN'T
GO ON HELPING HIM,

21:01.761 --> 21:05.365
HE WOULD TELL YOU EVERYTHING,
AND I WAS CAUGHT.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.367
I HOPED THAT AFTER
THE TRIALS WERE OVER,

21:07.400 --> 21:08.635
YOU WOULD NEVER FIND OUT.

21:08.668 --> 21:09.869
DAVID, I AM SO --

21:09.902 --> 21:12.672
DO NOT TOUCH ME.
I'M SO SORRY.

21:12.705 --> 21:17.444
CAN DAVID AND I HAVE A MINUTE
TO TALK ALONE, PLEASE?
OH, NO!
I AM DONE TALKING WITH YOU.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.878
WE HAVE TALKED ENOUGH,
OKAY?

21:18.911 --> 21:20.447
YOU KNOW, DID YOU --
DID YOU --

21:20.480 --> 21:22.815
DID YOU GET YOUR $60,000 WORTH
OUT OF ME, HMM?

21:22.849 --> 21:24.451
DID YOU HOLD MY HAND
ENOUGH?

21:24.484 --> 21:25.552
YOU DON'T THINK THAT!

21:25.585 --> 21:26.586
DID YOU GET PAID
A LITTLE EXTRA

21:26.619 --> 21:27.754
FOR SLEEPING WITH ME?!

21:27.787 --> 21:28.988
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT!
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:29.021 --> 21:31.023
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!
DAVID, I LOVE YOU!

21:31.057 --> 21:32.925
AM I REQUIRED TO STAY HERE?
BECAUSE I WOULD REALLY
LIKE TO GO NOW, PLEASE.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.328
WILL I AT LEAST GET A CHANCE
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF

21:35.362 --> 21:36.829
TO CHIEF JOHNSON
AND MY DIVISION?

21:36.863 --> 21:39.466
I'LL NEED TO GET
YOUR COMPLETE STATEMENT FIRST.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.768
FINE. WHATEVER.
JUST GET ME OUT OF HERE.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.102
JUST WAIT A SECOND.
PLEASE.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.904
YOU NEED TO GET YOUR STUFF
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.673
SHE NEEDS TO GET HER STUFF
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.608
DAVID,
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.577
WAIT A SECOND.
THIS WAY, DAVID.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.012
WAIT A SECOND!
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:55.147 --> 21:58.718
YOU NEED TO GET OUT
OF MY HOUSE.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.753
YOU NEED TO GET OUT
OF MY CHURCH.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.723
AND YOU NEED TO GET OUT
OF MY LIFE, ANN.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.725
DAVID, WAIT. I AM SORRY.

22:05.758 --> 22:06.993
I MEAN IT!
I'M SORRY! I --

22:13.065 --> 22:15.001
[ WHISPERING
INDISTINCTLY ]

22:19.071 --> 22:21.040
UM...

22:21.073 --> 22:24.010
PRINCE CHARMING'S
UNDERAGE GIRLFRIEND,

22:24.043 --> 22:26.078
JENNA BATEMAN, IS ON HER WAY UP
TO SPEAK WITH US.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.948
FLYNN'S MIRANDIZING HER NOW
IN THE ELEVATOR.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.017
WITH OR WITHOUT
HER FATHER?
WITHOUT.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.653
AND WE SENT SOME OFFICERS OVER
TO SEARCH LUKE'S APARTMENT.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.655
STILL NO SIGN
OF OUR 12-GAUGE.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.858
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE OUR LOVEBIRDS
WERE EXPECTING COMPANY.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.693
DID THEY HAVE SOMEPLACE
TO HIDE A SHOTGUN?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.395
NO.
WELL, THEN, WHERE'D
IT COME FROM?

22:42.429 --> 22:43.563
WHERE'D IT GO?

22:43.596 --> 22:44.897
Tao: MAYBE JENNA AND LUKE
HAD EXES

22:44.931 --> 22:47.066
WHO WERE UNHAPPY
WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIPS.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.502
EX WOULD HAVE SHOT
ONE OF THEM, NOT DANNY.

22:49.536 --> 22:50.870
Fritz:
YEAH, WHY SHOOT THE GUY

22:50.903 --> 22:52.472
WHO WAS MAKING THEM
GET DRESSED AND LEAVE?

22:52.505 --> 22:54.441
THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY
IRRATIONAL.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.608
YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

22:55.642 --> 22:58.811
CAN IT WAIT JUST...

22:58.845 --> 23:01.681
SORRY. YES. I-I DO.

23:04.784 --> 23:08.054
THESE HEELS
ARE TORTURING MY FEET.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.189
PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE TELL ME

23:10.222 --> 23:12.959
THAT YOU BROUGHT ME
ANOTHER PAIR OF SHOES.

23:12.992 --> 23:16.896
AND DON'T -- DON'T ASK ME
IF YOU NEED TO TALK TO ME.

23:16.929 --> 23:20.500
JUST SAY "LISTEN," OKAY?

23:20.533 --> 23:21.834
EVER SINCE
MAMA ASKED ME --

23:21.868 --> 23:23.436
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:23.470 --> 23:26.005
THIS -- THIS CONVERSATION,
THIS...

23:26.038 --> 23:29.509
ONGOING CONVERSATION
YOU KEEP HAVING WITH YOURSELF

23:29.542 --> 23:31.210
ABOUT WHAT YOUR MOTHER
WANTED TO SAY,

23:31.243 --> 23:33.646
WE'RE GONNA TABLE THAT
CONVERSATION FOR THE MOMENT

23:33.680 --> 23:38.451
SO WE CAN DISCUSS WHY I DID
NOT BRING YOU YOUR SHOES.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.652
YOU DIDN'T?

23:39.686 --> 23:41.588
NO.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.723
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOUR FEET ARE FEELING,

23:43.756 --> 23:45.057
YOU NEED TO GO HOME.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.225
I HAVE A JOB, TOO.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.528
I CAN'T KEEP RUNNING
BACK AND FORTH

23:48.561 --> 23:50.597
BETWEEN HERE AND HOME
AND A HOTEL.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.998
I REALLY CAN'T GO BACK HOME
RIGHT NOW.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.766
BRENDA, PLEASE.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.935
COME ON.
NO, NO, NO. REALLY.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.638
REALLY, I THINK --
I-I THINK WE SHOULD JUST MOVE.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.674
WELL, WE CAN TALK ABOUT FINDING
ANOTHER PLACE, SWEETHEART.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.676
BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO
UNPACK OUR SUITCASES.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.077
WE HAVE TO PICK UP JOEL.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.513
YOU DON'T THINK
HE'S FREAKED OUT?

24:06.546 --> 24:07.880
HE'S BEEN BOARDED
FOR OVER A WEEK.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.649
AND, HONEY,
I MISS YOUR MOTHER, TOO --

24:09.682 --> 24:12.885
OF COURSE I DO --
BUT YOUR MOTHER...

24:12.919 --> 24:15.021
IS NOT AT OUR HOUSE.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.126
AND YOU NEED TO BE.

24:26.165 --> 24:29.802
Jenna: OH, MY GOD.
WHY SHOW ME THIS PICTURE?

24:29.836 --> 24:34.173
IF YOU KNOW HE'S DEAD.
THAT IS...AWFUL.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.742
WHY --
WHY SHOW ME THAT?

24:35.775 --> 24:37.710
BECAUSE YOU
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND, LUKE,

24:37.744 --> 24:39.579
ARE MAYBE
THE LAST TWO PEOPLE

24:39.612 --> 24:41.213
TO SEE THIS MAN,
DANNY CHAIDEZ, ALIVE.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.950
OH, I WASN'T WITH LUKE
LAST NIGHT.

24:45.652 --> 24:48.921
JENNA, YOU CHOSE TO COME DOWN
HERE ON YOUR OWN,

24:48.955 --> 24:50.289
BUT IF YOU CONTINUE
TO ACT LIKE A CHILD,

24:50.322 --> 24:51.891
I'M GONNA HAVE TO HAVE
YOUR FATHER COME --

24:51.924 --> 24:54.093
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
PLEASE. PLEASE.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.261
PLEASE, GOD, NO.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.196
MY DAD IS
TOTALLY OUT OF HIS MIND.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.666
HE WILL, LIKE,
GROUND ME FOREVER.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.101
HE'S GOT ALL
THESE CRAZY CURFEW RULES.

25:02.134 --> 25:05.237
SERIOUSLY, IF MY DAD HEARS
I WAS WITH LUKE, HE'LL GO CRAZY.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.273
OKAY, JENNA.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.141
I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.777
YOU TELL ME
ALL ABOUT THE HOUSE

25:10.810 --> 25:12.679
THAT YOU AND LUKE
HUNG OUT IN LAST NIGHT,

25:12.712 --> 25:13.980
AND I'LL KEEP IT
BETWEEN US.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.950
MY FRIEND, ELLEN,
USED TO LIVE IN THAT HOUSE

25:17.984 --> 25:19.552
UNTIL THEY HAD TO,
LIKE, LEAVE

25:19.586 --> 25:21.788
BECAUSE HER DAD COULDN'T
PAY FOR THEIR MORTGAGE.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.756
HE WAS --
HE WAS SIDEWAYS ON IT.
UPSIDE DOWN.

25:23.790 --> 25:26.125
WHAT?
HE WAS UPSIDE DOWN
ON THE MORTGAGE.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.127
OH.
THE POINT IS, LIEUTENANT,

25:28.160 --> 25:29.762
THAT HER FRIEND WAS GONE.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.764
SO, HOW DID YOU GET IN
AND OUT OF THAT HOUSE?

25:31.798 --> 25:34.166
SHE HAD A KEY TO MY PLACE,
AND I HAD A KEY TO HERS.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.703
AND WE WOULD JUST SPEND TIME
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW,

25:36.736 --> 25:39.071
LIKE WHEN MY FATHER WAS AT WORK,
AND JUST BE CHILL.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.107
AND SMOKE POT...
LIKE YOU DID WITH LUKE?

25:41.140 --> 25:45.277
LUKE HAS A PRESCRIPTION FOR POT
FROM A DOCTOR IN A CLINIC.

25:45.311 --> 25:49.081
THAT IS HIS MEDICINE FOR --
FOR CALMING HIM DOWN AND STUFF.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.884
OKAY. JENNA, HOW DID
YOUR FRIEND'S HOUSE KEY

25:51.918 --> 25:54.587
END UP IN THE MURDERED
SECURITY GUARD'S POCKET?

25:54.621 --> 25:56.322
I SERIOUSLY DON'T KNOW.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.090
ALL RIGHT, CAN WE JUST
CALL HER FATHER

25:58.124 --> 26:00.727
AND GET THIS OVER WITH?
NO! NO!
THEN STOP LYING.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.995
WHY WAS THE KEY
IN THE VICTIM'S POCKET?

26:05.798 --> 26:07.199
OKAY.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.637
THIS IS, UM...
THIS IS REALLY EMBARRASSING.

26:10.670 --> 26:14.674
BUT LUKE AND I WERE HANGING OUT
IN THE SLEEPING BAG, YOU KNOW,

26:14.707 --> 26:17.610
JUST LISTENING TO MUSIC,
WHEN THIS SECURITY GUY,

26:17.644 --> 26:21.648
HE -- HE BARGED IN,
AND HE THREW US OUT

26:21.681 --> 26:23.950
WITHOUT KNOWING THAT I HAD
A RIGHT TO BE THERE.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.718
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.987
THE SECURITY GUARD, HE SAID,
"GET DRESSED AND GO HOME."

26:28.020 --> 26:29.255
ANYTHING ABOUT GABRIEL?

26:29.288 --> 26:30.857
AND -- AND LUKE
WAS ALL, "YES, SIR."

26:30.890 --> 26:32.224
DAMNDEST THING.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.860
I TOLD YOU
FROM THE BEGINNING, SIR,

26:33.893 --> 26:35.027
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.663
I'M NOT LISTENING NOW,
EITHER.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.898
AND THE SECURITY GUY
WHO WAS, LIKE,

26:38.931 --> 26:41.901
THIS BOSSY KNOW-IT-ALL,
HE GAVE ME A LECTURE,

26:41.934 --> 26:44.403
AND HE MADE ME GIVE HIM THE KEY
THAT MY FRIEND HAD LEFT ME.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.005
MAINLY, I WAS JUST SCARED

26:46.038 --> 26:47.640
THAT HE WAS GONNA TELL MY DAD
ABOUT LUKE, BUT HE --

26:47.674 --> 26:49.241
HE JUST WALKED ME
TO MY DRIVEWAY

26:49.275 --> 26:52.945
AND HE SAID IF HE EVER CAUGHT US
AGAIN, HE WOULD CALL THE POLICE.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.948
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO SHOT MR. CHAIDEZ

26:55.982 --> 26:57.316
JUST A FEW MINUTES
AFTER THAT?

26:59.318 --> 27:02.354
ACTUALLY, RIGHT AS I WAS
ABOUT TO GO IN MY HOUSE,

27:02.388 --> 27:05.157
I DID SEE
THIS, UM, THIS MAN.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.726
HE WAS ON A MOTORCYCLE,

27:06.759 --> 27:09.261
AND HE WAS GOING
REALLY SLOWLY UP THE STREET.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.398
HE WAS, LIKE -- HE WAS
THIS BIG BLACK GUY, YOU KNOW?

27:12.431 --> 27:14.366
HUGE, REALLY.

27:14.400 --> 27:18.037
AND HE STARTED TRASH-TALKING
THE SECURITY GUARD.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.806
NOW, THAT SOUNDS
SUSPICIOUS.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.376
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
A BIG BLACK GUY?

27:24.410 --> 27:28.180
LIEUTENANT? COULD YOU PLEASE GET
A WARRANT FOR JENNA'S HOUSE?

27:28.214 --> 27:30.717
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
12-GAUGE SHOTGUN.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.351
I DON'T THINK JENNA COULD
HANDLE ONE OF THOSE, CHIEF.

27:32.384 --> 27:33.753
WELL, MAYBE SHE CAN.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.855
SHE CAME HOME LAST NIGHT
WITHOUT HER BRA.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.758
AND I'M WONDERING HOW SHE
EXPLAINED THAT TO HER FATHER.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.863
UH, CHIEF, CAN WE TALK?

27:43.896 --> 27:46.032
SURE, DAVID. WE CAN TALK.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.836
LIEUTENANT?
I'LL GET THE WARRANT.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.016
Raydor:
THERE IS NO QUESTION

28:04.050 --> 28:05.451
THAT SOME OF HIS CONVERSATIONS
WITH ANN MASON

28:05.484 --> 28:07.153
WERE TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS
OF HIS OATH.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.721
BUT NEARLY EVERYONE
IN THE L.A.P.D.

28:08.755 --> 28:11.858
DISCUSSES CONFIDENTIAL
WORK ISSUES

28:11.891 --> 28:13.325
WITH THEIR SIGNIFICANT
OTHER.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.828
YES. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN,
FOR YOUR REPORT.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.430
YOU'RE WELCOME, CHIEF.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.767
IF I MAY.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.303
DETECTIVE GABRIEL WAIVED
HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL

28:24.336 --> 28:28.174
AND FULLY COOPERATED SO THAT
HE COULD EXPLAIN HIMSELF TO YOU.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.877
I TRUST THAT WILL SPEAK
IN HIS FAVOR.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.013
EXCUSE ME.

28:39.018 --> 28:41.253
SHARED A LOT OF MISGIVINGS
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND, DAVID.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.956
CHIEF, I AM VERY SORRY --

28:43.990 --> 28:46.058
OH, NO, NO. WE ARE
A VERY LONG WAY FROM "SORRY."

28:48.027 --> 28:51.330
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH THIS LAWSUIT...

28:51.363 --> 28:52.899
IF YOU HAD SUCH A PROBLEM

28:52.932 --> 28:55.467
WITH THE WAY THAT WE DEALT
WITH TURELL BAYLOR,

28:55.501 --> 28:57.503
WHY DIDN'T YOU SPEAK UP
AT THE TIME?
CHIEF, I DID THAT.

28:57.536 --> 29:00.807
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO ME?
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I DID SPEAK UP.

29:00.840 --> 29:04.243
OKAY, WHEN YOU PUT TURELL BAYLOR
ON THE STREET

29:04.276 --> 29:05.945
IN FRONT OF
HIS OWN GANG MEMBERS

29:05.978 --> 29:07.413
WHO WE KNEW
WANTED TO KILL HIM,

29:07.446 --> 29:09.348
I ASKED YOU,

29:09.381 --> 29:12.051
I SAID, "ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO LEAVE HIM LIKE THAT?"

29:12.084 --> 29:14.120
AND YOU SAID, "DRIVE."
I REMEMBER
THAT DAY VERY WELL,

29:14.153 --> 29:15.955
YOU SAID,
"DAVID I WANT TO LEAVE."
AND YOU DID NOT SOUND
UPSET TO ME.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.991
PLEASE DO NOT SAY
THAT I DID NOT SEEM UPSET, OKAY?

29:19.025 --> 29:21.828
BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER
EXACTLY HOW I SOUNDED.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.896
OR MAYBE
WE SHOULD ASK SANCHEZ.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.832
HE'LL REMEMBER FOR YOU.

29:26.899 --> 29:29.902
I WASN'T...

29:29.936 --> 29:32.771
I WASN'T SURE THAT WE WERE
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.875
I'M STILL NOT SURE.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.211
ARE YOU?

29:44.550 --> 29:49.555
Gabriel: AND BECAUSE I WAS
UNCERTAIN ABOUT MY OWN ACTIONS,

29:49.588 --> 29:53.592
EVEN MONTHS LATER,
I TALKED ABOUT IT WITH THE...

29:53.625 --> 29:56.428
WITH THE WOMAN
I EXPECTED TO MARRY.

29:57.629 --> 30:02.334
AS ANN AND I DISCUSSED
WHAT HAPPENED TO TURELL BAYLOR,

30:02.368 --> 30:07.373
I ALSO MENTIONED
OTHER INSTANCES WHERE,

30:07.406 --> 30:10.609
IN CLOSING OUR CASES...

30:10.642 --> 30:14.881
IT MAY HAVE APPEARED
AS THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW

30:14.914 --> 30:18.084
WAS NOT PERFECTLY UPHELD.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.552
I'M SURE THOSE WERE
YOUR EXACT WORDS, TOO.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.588
I WAS NOT THE LEAK.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.490
BUT YOU WERE THE SOURCE.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.159
U-UNLESS YOU'VE NEVER SAID
ANYTHING STUPID

30:27.193 --> 30:29.361
TO A WOMAN
YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH,

30:29.395 --> 30:31.197
WHY DON'T YOU JUST STOP
WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR A SECOND

30:31.230 --> 30:32.431
AND LET THE MAN FINISH?

30:36.568 --> 30:38.304
THERE'S, UH...

30:38.337 --> 30:41.540
THERE'S NOTHING
LEFT TO SAY, REALLY,

30:41.573 --> 30:44.343
OTHER THAN, UM...

30:44.376 --> 30:49.481
I AM TRULY SORRY TO EVERYONE
FOR EVERYTHING.

30:58.124 --> 31:00.226
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.230
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

31:05.331 --> 31:08.334
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.508
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.616
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

31:30.990 --> 31:34.961
NOW...PUT IN
FOR A TRANSFER.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.642
Baldwin: IT'S NOT OVER.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.344
Pope: WELL, WE FOUND THE MURDER
WEAPON IN THE GIRL'S HOUSE

31:52.378 --> 31:53.946
REGISTERED
TO HER FATHER, OKAY?

31:53.980 --> 31:55.982
BALLISTICS MATCHED THE SHOTGUN
TO THE SHELLS,

31:56.015 --> 31:57.449
SO IT KIND OF FEELS
LIKE IT'S OVER.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.118
BUT AS I KEEP
TELLING PEOPLE,

31:59.151 --> 32:01.053
THE VICTIM WAS ARMED
AND AN EXPERIENCED SOLDIER.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.322
UH-HUH. WHO WAS AWARDED
THE SILVER STAR.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.024
FOR KILLING PEOPLE.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.359
HIS STATUS AS A VETERAN WILL
BE USED AGAINST US IN COURT.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.195
THE ATTORNEY WILL SAY
THE DEFENDANT --

32:09.228 --> 32:10.596
IT'S DEFENDANTS NOW.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.999
CHIEF JOHNSON BELIEVES
SHE HAS TWO SUSPECTS.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.034
AND I-I GET WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

32:15.067 --> 32:17.336
THEY CAN CLAIM SELF-DEFENSE
IF THEY CAN SELL THE IDEA

32:17.369 --> 32:19.538
THAT OUR VICTIM APPROACHED THEM
WITH DEADLY FORCE.

32:19.571 --> 32:22.408
AND WE CAN END UP FACING SEVERAL
CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO MURDER.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.643
MM-HMM. WOULD A CONFESSION
HELP YOU WITH THAT?

32:26.078 --> 32:28.514
TWO WOULD BE BETTER.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.449
Mr. Bateman:
SHE'S A MINOR.

32:30.482 --> 32:33.052
Brenda: YOUR DAUGHTER'S 16.
THAT'S OLD ENOUGH TO CONSENT --

32:33.085 --> 32:35.187
CONSENT?
CONSENT TO WHAT?

32:35.221 --> 32:38.524
Sanchez: MR. BATEMAN,
WE READ YOU YOUR RIGHTS

32:38.557 --> 32:41.060
SO THAT WE COULD QUESTION YOU,
NOT SO YOU COULD QUESTION US.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.461
WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS?

32:42.494 --> 32:44.230
I'M NOT ANSWERING ANYTHING
UNTIL YOU TELL ME

32:44.263 --> 32:46.198
WHY YOU CALLED JENNA DOWN HERE
BEHIND MY BACK.

32:46.232 --> 32:48.400
WE WANTED TO KNOW IF SHE
RECOGNIZED THIS YOUNG MAN,

32:48.434 --> 32:50.769
DANNY CHAIDEZ.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.339
LAST NIGHT,
HE WAS SHOT TO DEATH

32:53.372 --> 32:55.374
BY WHAT BALLISTICS
TELL US

32:55.407 --> 32:58.177
IS A SHOTGUN
REGISTERED IN YOUR NAME.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.046
IT DOESN'T GET MUCH SIMPLER
THAN THAT, SIR.

33:00.079 --> 33:03.549
OUR VICTIM WAS MURDERED
BY EITHER YOU OR YOUR DAUGHTER.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.618
WHO WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO ARREST?

33:08.554 --> 33:10.622
IF THERE ARE
MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES,

33:10.656 --> 33:13.225
I URGE YOU TO SHARE THEM
WITH US NOW, SIR,

33:13.259 --> 33:15.194
BEFORE I HAVE TO HAND YOU OVER
TO THE D.A.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.535
HE TRIED -- THIS GUY TRIED
TO RAPE MY DAUGHTER.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.771
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

33:25.804 --> 33:28.307
HE MOLESTED MY LITTLE GIRL.
HE TRIED TO RAPE HER.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.508
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE TRIED TO RAPE HER?

33:29.541 --> 33:30.776
JENNA TOLD ME.

33:30.809 --> 33:33.345
SHE WALKED IN THE HOUSE,

33:33.379 --> 33:35.347
NO BRA, HER UNDERPANTS
STUFFED IN HER POCKET,

33:35.381 --> 33:40.452
IN TEARS, SHAKING,
BECAUSE YOUR SO-CALLED VICTIM,

33:40.486 --> 33:43.789
THIS RENT-A-COP,
HAD PULLED A GUN ON HER,

33:43.822 --> 33:46.425
FORCED HER INTO AN EMPTY HOUSE
AROUND THE CORNER,

33:46.458 --> 33:49.661
AND MADE HER STRIP
AND TRIED TO MOUNT HER.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.634
Sanchez: SO YOU WENT OUT
LOOKING FOR HIM?

33:55.667 --> 33:57.836
I JUST WANTED TO HOLD HIM
IN ONE PLACE

33:57.869 --> 33:59.405
TILL THE POLICE ARRIVED,

33:59.438 --> 34:01.440
MAKE SURE HE DIDN'T
GO AFTER ANYONE ELSE.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.409
HE WAS JUST STANDING THERE
BY HIS CAR,

34:03.442 --> 34:06.378
WHERE JENNA SAID HE'D BE,
LIKE NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.280
I ASKED HIM WHY THE HELL
HE WAS MESSING WITH MY DAUGHTER.

34:08.314 --> 34:09.548
YOU KNOW WHAT HE TOLD ME?

34:09.581 --> 34:11.550
HE SAID SHE WAS ASKING
FOR TROUBLE

34:11.583 --> 34:14.786
AND THAT NEXT TIME,
HE'D SEE SHE GOT IT.

34:14.820 --> 34:15.854
SO YOU SHOT HIM.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.156
YEAH, I SHOT HIM.

34:17.189 --> 34:18.824
PERVERT.

34:18.857 --> 34:22.861
WHO KNOWS WHAT OTHER GIRLS
HE'S TREATED LIKE THAT?

34:22.894 --> 34:25.631
THANK YOU, MR. BATEMAN.
I'M SURE THAT WASN'T EASY.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.501
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,
WOULD YOU SEE TO IT

34:29.535 --> 34:32.471
THAT MR. BATEMAN
WRITES DOWN A STATEMENT?

34:32.504 --> 34:34.373
HOW DOES SHE INCLUDE
THE GIRL IN ALL OF THIS?

34:34.406 --> 34:36.308
YOU HAVE A PERFECT CASE
OF MURDER IN THE FIRST

34:36.342 --> 34:37.809
WITH THIS GUY.

34:37.843 --> 34:40.146
THANKS,
BUT I'M TRADING IT IN

34:40.179 --> 34:42.548
FOR TWO COUNTS OF MURDER
IN THE SECOND.
HOW?

34:42.581 --> 34:45.151
MR. BATEMAN JUST SAID
DANNY WAS STANDING

34:45.184 --> 34:47.219
RIGHT WHERE JENNA
SAID HE WOULD BE.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.620
IF YOU ARREST
THE DAUGHTER --

34:48.654 --> 34:50.156
NO, NO, NO. NOT "IF."

34:50.189 --> 34:52.524
I'M ARRESTING JENNA,
AND YOU WILL PROSECUTE HER.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.793
IT'S NOT ENOUGH
THAT JENNA TOLD HER FATHER

34:54.826 --> 34:56.528
WHERE HE COULD FIND
THE VICTIM.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.530
YOU ALSO NEED TO ASK HER
IF HE HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.199
PLEASE. RELAX.

35:00.232 --> 35:03.269
SHE'S ABOUT TO TELL US
EVERYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.406
HELLO, JENNA.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.874
SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING,

35:08.907 --> 35:11.310
BUT I WAS JUST LISTENING
TO YOUR FATHER

35:11.343 --> 35:13.779
CONFESS TO MURDERING
THE SECURITY GUARD LAST NIGHT.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.784
OH, NO.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.453
THAT IS SO AWFUL.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.724
ARE YOU --
ARE YOU PUTTING HIM IN JAIL?

35:25.757 --> 35:27.693
MAYBE.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.261
MAYBE NOT.

35:29.295 --> 35:32.331
THERE COULD BE
MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.166
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"MITIGATING"?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.868
"MITIGATING"
MEANS THAT, UM,

35:36.902 --> 35:38.904
YOUR FATHER HAD A REASON
TO COMMIT MURDER,

35:38.937 --> 35:41.373
SUCH AS DANNY CHAIDEZ
TRIED TO RAPE YOU,

35:41.407 --> 35:42.674
WHICH IS WHAT YOU TOLD HIM,

35:42.708 --> 35:44.410
EVEN THOUGH WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.614
LOOK...

35:48.647 --> 35:50.849
I LEFT MY BRA
AT THE OTHER HOUSE,

35:50.882 --> 35:54.320
AND...WELL, YOU SEE
WHAT MY DAD IS LIKE.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.888
SO, YOU TOLD YOUR DAD
THAT YOU WERE RAPED

35:56.922 --> 35:58.557
TO PROTECT YOUR BOYFRIEND.

35:58.590 --> 36:01.760
I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING OR HE
WOULD HAVE GONE AFTER LUKE.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.629
I UNDERSTAND.

36:03.662 --> 36:07.333
NOW, IN ORDER TO JUST CONFIRM
YOUR FATHER'S VERSION OF EVENTS,

36:07.366 --> 36:10.436
WHICH I'M AFRAID
IS GOING TO SEND HIM TO JAIL

36:10.469 --> 36:13.739
FOR THE REST
OF HIS LIFE...

36:13.772 --> 36:15.474
IN WHICH HAND
WAS HE HOLDING THE SHOTGUN

36:15.507 --> 36:16.775
WHEN HE WALKED
OUT OF THE HOUSE?

36:23.515 --> 36:24.783
HIS RIGHT.

36:24.816 --> 36:25.884
YOU SURE?

36:25.917 --> 36:27.453
YEP.

36:27.486 --> 36:28.854
I SAW HIM.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.522
HE TOOK IT
OUT OF THE CLOSET

36:30.556 --> 36:32.858
RIGHT BEFORE HE ASKED ME
WHERE THE GUARD WAS.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.560
IT'S SO TERRIBLE

36:34.593 --> 36:36.628
THAT HE HAS TO GO
TO JAIL FOR THIS.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.767
BUT SINCE
I'M, LIKE, ALMOST 17,

36:41.800 --> 36:45.337
I CAN STILL, LIKE,
LIVE IN OUR HOUSE, RIGHT?

36:45.371 --> 36:47.673
I'LL FILE ON BOTH OF THEM.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.676
CAN YOU PASS ALONG
MY CONGRATULATIONS?

36:50.709 --> 36:52.678
SHE'LL BE SORRY
SHE MISSED YOU.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.546
I THINK
I CAN MANAGE MYSELF.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.482
GOOD NIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

36:56.515 --> 36:59.718
I DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO, LIKE,
FOSTER CARE OR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

36:59.751 --> 37:03.722
REALLY, NO, I-I THINK I AM OLD
ENOUGH TO GET BY ON MY OWN.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.023
I AGREE.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.559
ANOTHER PARENT
WOULD BE WASTED ON YOU.

37:07.593 --> 37:10.662
I-IN FACT, I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

37:10.696 --> 37:13.499
IS READY TO TREAT YOU LIKE AN
ADULT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

37:13.532 --> 37:14.833
COOL.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.568
WAY COOL.

37:27.979 --> 37:28.980
COME IN.

37:36.655 --> 37:40.526
I, UH, SENT MY LETTER
OF RESIGNATION

37:40.559 --> 37:41.660
TO CHIEF POPE'S OFFICE,

37:41.693 --> 37:43.662
AND LIEUTENANT TAO
HAS COPIES

37:43.695 --> 37:45.631
OF ALL OF MY OUTSTANDING
CASE NOTES,

37:45.664 --> 37:47.966
AND LIEUTENANT PROVENZA FOUND
A DETECTIVE IN CENTRAL

37:47.999 --> 37:50.068
WHO WILL COVER FOR ME
UNTIL YOU CAN FIND

37:50.101 --> 37:51.870
A PERMANENT REPLACEMENT.
DAVID,
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.772
I AM.
NO, NO, NO.
NOT TODAY. PLEASE.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.374
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

37:55.407 --> 37:56.975
CHIEF, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.378
I CAN'T JUST GO BACK TO MY DESK
AND ACT LIKE NOTHING'S CHANGED.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.613
I CAN'T EVEN GO HOME
RIGHT NOW...

38:01.647 --> 38:03.715
BECAUSE SHE'S THERE PACKING.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.418
MAYBE YOU'RE TOO UPSET
WITH ME

38:06.452 --> 38:08.086
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M GOING
THROUGH RIGHT NOW,

38:08.119 --> 38:09.888
BUT THIS WHOLE...

38:11.423 --> 38:12.791
THIS TURELL BAYLOR THING.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.829
SOMETIMES I FEEL
LIKE IT RUINED MY LIFE.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.631
I CAN RELATE.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.035
AND YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.704
YOU WERE UPSET THAT DAY.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.707
I KNEW YOU WERE UPSET,
BUT I-I DIDN'T LISTEN.

38:30.742 --> 38:36.348
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT --
THE NOT LISTENING WELL ENOUGH.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.420
IT'S FUNNY. I...

38:42.654 --> 38:46.458
SOMETIMES
I FEEL LIKE I...

38:46.492 --> 38:48.760
PAY MORE ATTENTION
TO WHAT MURDERERS HAVE TO SAY

38:48.794 --> 38:50.996
WHILE IGNORING THE PEOPLE
I REALLY CARE ABOUT.

38:52.631 --> 38:57.002
OKAY, ANYWAY, I-I CAN'T
LET YOU QUIT OVER THIS.

38:57.035 --> 39:00.639
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY,
AND I HOPE YOU'LL ACCEPT MINE.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.577
I GAVE THE ORDER TO DRIVE.

39:05.611 --> 39:09.881
AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
AFTER THAT...

39:09.915 --> 39:11.783
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL OF IT.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.827
I NEED YOU HERE.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.005
OKAY, CHIEF.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.777
OKAY.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.146
THANK YOU.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.797
YOU ALL RIGHT?

41:08.033 --> 41:12.638
LAST TIME I SAW MAMA,
SHE ASKED ME IF I HAD A MINUTE.

41:12.671 --> 41:15.841
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
JUST THEN.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.210
AND NOW I'M THE ONE

41:19.244 --> 41:22.781
WHO COULD REALLY USE
A MINUTE...

41:22.814 --> 41:25.651
AND SHE HAS
NO TIME AT ALL.
