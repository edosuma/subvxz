WEBVTT

00:15.348 --> 00:18.935
<i>Vehicle One, Joo Gyeong-nam,
advances to the final round.</i>

00:18.935 --> 00:22.605
<i>Participant Number Eight,
Refugee 034, is currently in second.</i>

00:22.605 --> 00:25.108
Don't think, don't think, don't think.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.444
Think, think, think.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.324
Let's go!

00:42.792 --> 00:44.127
Idiot.

00:55.346 --> 00:56.681
Get in! Quick!

01:00.810 --> 01:01.895
Thanks.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.036
So now two people
are tied for second here?

01:18.536 --> 01:20.872
Uh, I guess so.

01:23.374 --> 01:24.209
FINISH LINE

01:24.209 --> 01:26.795
<i>Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su
and Refugee 034,</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:28.379
<i>have crossed the finish line.</i>

01:42.685 --> 01:43.770
CHEONMYEONG GROUP

01:44.938 --> 01:45.772
Good work.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.566
Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su,

01:48.566 --> 01:51.069
you came in second
and will advance to the final round.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.029
What about me?

01:53.029 --> 01:54.489
I crossed the finish line with her.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.449
Participant Eight,
you were disqualified.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.368
What do you mean?
We crossed together.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.285
I brought this.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.663
You lost your car,
and your package was damaged.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.124
- Both grounds for disqualification.
- What?

02:06.209 --> 02:07.836
<i>Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su,</i>

02:07.836 --> 02:10.797
<i>came in second
and will advance to the final round.</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:14.634
<i>Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su, came in second
and will advance to the final round.</i>

02:42.203 --> 02:44.122
We have a problem with the final round.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.375
Seems Participant Number Three is out
due to an arm injury.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.340
- Did you investigate?
- Yes. Your guess was correct.

02:54.924 --> 02:55.967
She broke her arm.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.930
Okay. Who goes to the final?

03:02.640 --> 03:05.727
The eliminated refugee or fourth place?

03:06.603 --> 03:07.854
We'll set the atmosphere.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.025
The deliverymen
who observed the competition think

03:12.025 --> 03:13.735
that we should advance the refugee boy.

03:13.735 --> 03:14.903
Oh yeah?

03:16.487 --> 03:18.198
Because he saved someone's life?

03:20.575 --> 03:23.870
REFUGEE 034
MUSCLE MASS: MAX, BMI: MAX

03:28.082 --> 03:32.170
"The refugee participant who saved a life
and crossed the finish line with her."

03:32.754 --> 03:34.756
It will give some hope to the refugees,

03:35.965 --> 03:37.884
and then our plan will be easier.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.611
The weather's just like me, lousy.

04:03.910 --> 04:04.744
Huh?

04:10.833 --> 04:11.918
What is that?

04:18.132 --> 04:19.592
Hey, losers!

04:22.679 --> 04:25.598
Who are you calling "losers"
Not me, surely, right?

04:26.182 --> 04:27.350
I advance to the final.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.018
REFUGEE O34

04:33.523 --> 04:34.524
- Really?
- For real?

04:34.524 --> 04:35.608
Yeah, for real! Duh!

04:35.608 --> 04:38.027
How did you do that?
Someone end up dropping out?

04:38.027 --> 04:39.529
Who? How did you know?

04:39.529 --> 04:41.197
- So, yeah?
- Did they?

04:47.870 --> 04:51.374
Here are the numbers, genders,
age groups, and average oxygen consumption

04:51.374 --> 04:53.251
of the residents in each district.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.336
I'll start
with the General District first.

04:55.336 --> 04:58.673
We have plenty of data like this
at Cheonmyeong Group.

04:58.673 --> 04:59.716
This isn't new.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.262
Mr. Ryu didn't come all the way here
for something so obvious.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.184
So what exactly can we help with?

05:10.184 --> 05:12.395
Well, I believe we've indicated that--

05:12.395 --> 05:13.563
Mr. Oh.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.192
You provided some basic data points.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.279
In order to reassign residents,
I'll be needing something more.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.530
Something like

05:23.489 --> 05:26.075
personal data on all residents.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.078
I want to know physical fitness,
IQ numbers.

05:29.078 --> 05:32.081
I want medical records,
I want past criminal offenses.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.085
Is that too much for me to ask here?

05:36.085 --> 05:39.839
Providing data of that sort could be
considered a violation of human rights.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.842
It requires proper authorization.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.095
Well, I'm certain the defense minister
has done just that.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.598
Grade One data requires official approval.

05:52.435 --> 05:56.230
Major, do you disagree
with Cheonmyeong's relocation plan?

05:58.274 --> 05:59.650
I'm a soldier above all.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.487
I don't have opinions.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.672
<i>Special District working hours
are now over.</i>

06:21.672 --> 06:23.674
<i>Controlling oxygen level.</i>

06:30.515 --> 06:32.058
I haven't ordered anything.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.898
It's a special delivery.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.778
Yes. I'll get it done
as quickly as possible, sir.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.912
You've mentioned a fair relocation,
mind elaborating?

06:54.664 --> 06:57.875
Well, we'll have a selection process
for the new environment.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.335
"Selection process?"

06:59.335 --> 07:02.046
Sounds like controlling residents
using relocation rights.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.589
Controlling?

07:06.300 --> 07:07.301
That's a fitting word.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.847
Shouldn't people pay a price
for a better life?

07:10.847 --> 07:14.600
I think a bigger issue would be if
everyone took what we've done for granted.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.521
Don't you agree with me?

07:18.521 --> 07:21.732
A selection cannot possibly reflect
any level of fairness,

07:21.732 --> 07:23.860
no matter the criteria you may employ.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.737
That's why your help is greatly needed.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.491
So we can do our best to be fair,
all right, Major?

07:35.913 --> 07:38.166
Let's have the next briefing
at Cheonmyeong.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.635
Ooh.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.224
Ryu spoke
to the Intelligence Command major.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.439
So the relocation plan's now
in Cheonmyeong's control?

08:01.439 --> 08:04.275
Well, the chairman's backing
the government's relocation plan,

08:04.275 --> 08:06.068
which includes the refugees.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.905
This is pitting father against son,
so to speak.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.784
I don't trust Chairman Ryu either,
to be honest.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.996
Nine years ago
he massacred all of those refugees.

08:18.414 --> 08:21.000
So what if the man's sorry,
it won't bring them back.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.835
I'm not telling you to let it go.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.547
I'm just saying the bigger enemy
is his son, Ryu Seok.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.382
Right now, he's the one holding the reins.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.554
The dad's with the president,

08:34.138 --> 08:36.057
the son's with the defense minister.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.644
They'll choose
what they feel suits their goals.

08:43.439 --> 08:46.484
Did you look into
what I asked you about?

08:46.984 --> 08:49.904
There are no human experiment labs
in the Special District.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.155
There's only a hospital.

08:51.989 --> 08:54.450
If there were, the cleaning vehicle
would have gone there.

09:04.835 --> 09:08.422
Why are they demanding people's
personal information and bio data too?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.175
They're trying to build Cheonmyeong's
new world

09:11.175 --> 09:13.678
with people with the most superior genes.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.850
I'm stuck between Cheonmyeong
and the government now.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.435
If that's what's happening,

09:21.936 --> 09:24.564
I think you should try
to remain neutral in this.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.415
<i>Everyone's in position.</i>

09:46.419 --> 09:48.004
Start when I give the signal.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.046
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

09:59.599 --> 10:00.558
<i>Begin.</i>

10:09.233 --> 10:11.193
All right. Looks good, huh?

10:12.028 --> 10:13.195
Confirmed.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.115
Keep an eye on him
from your positions.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.916
- Come back again.
- See you next time!

10:30.338 --> 10:31.422
He's heading your way.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.136
Lee,
take position on the opposite side.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.262
The rest, back him up.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.347
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

11:05.539 --> 11:07.541
He's onto us. The western alley!

11:14.465 --> 11:16.175
Lee,
what's your current location?

11:16.175 --> 11:17.760
Heading to the end of the alley!

11:17.760 --> 11:19.679
He went into the building.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.138
Sweep the area.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.396
Drop your gun.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.375
Are you a soldier?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.210
If you wanna be precise,

11:51.836 --> 11:52.670
soldiers.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.046
Hands in the air.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.716
Drop your gun.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.344
Drop your gun and get on the ground.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.367
<i>I saw the man die.</i>

12:24.201 --> 12:26.746
A tiny device had exploded
inside of his head.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.630
Can this be fixed?

12:41.135 --> 12:43.804
So why do you want to become
a deliveryman?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.306
Well,

12:46.140 --> 12:47.099
you know...

12:48.851 --> 12:51.437
I can't stay here
and keep wasting precious air and food.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.563
Don't say that.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.940
Feeding you really is no trouble at all.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.276
Is it your friend,

12:58.444 --> 12:59.653
the one in the necklace?

13:08.996 --> 13:09.872
Mm-hmm.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.045
If it's really what you want,
I'll root for you.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.882
You made it this far, go ahead and win it!

14:24.071 --> 14:25.197
Huh?

14:25.197 --> 14:27.366
Yoon Sa-wol,
the dumbass, in the final round.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.410
Guess I underestimated you.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.457
What about those guys?
You catch them?

14:36.417 --> 14:37.334
Not yet.

14:38.961 --> 14:39.795
Your memories?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.381
Not yet.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.800
<i>We are now
at Special District, first floor.</i>

14:44.800 --> 14:47.052
Whether you win or lose,
remember to stay safe.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.637
Was that encouragement?

14:48.637 --> 14:50.139
Of course.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.782
<i>Today's Special District
air quality.</i>

15:08.782 --> 15:11.327
<i>Oxygen level is at five percent.</i>

15:11.327 --> 15:13.495
<i>Fine dust level is average.</i>

15:13.495 --> 15:15.414
<i>Humidity is at 52%.</i>

15:15.414 --> 15:16.332
Wow.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.917
<i>The temperature is...</i>

15:17.917 --> 15:19.585
This place is awesome.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.130
The refugee participant will stay
in temporary lodging

15:23.130 --> 15:24.381
until the competition.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.635
There is one rule.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.388
You may not leave your lodgings
unless accompanied by your mentor.

15:31.889 --> 15:32.765
Mentor?

15:33.557 --> 15:34.600
What's a mentor?

15:36.852 --> 15:38.562
The one behind you is your mentor.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.524
Ohh.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.193
So your name's Mentor?

15:45.653 --> 15:48.072
Yeah. My name's Mentor.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.038
JOO GYEONG-NAM VS REFUGEE 034

16:02.920 --> 16:03.754
JOO GYEONG-NAM

16:04.797 --> 16:06.840
REFUGEE 034

16:17.434 --> 16:18.852
JOO GYEONG-NAM
SECOND ROUND WINNER

16:23.273 --> 16:24.108
REFUGEE 034
FINALIST BY DEFAULT

16:27.194 --> 16:30.280
Well, it looks like they're all focused
on the refugee boy, as expected.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.075
Of course. Especially since
we sent him to the finals.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.077
What happens now is more important.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.120
Yes, sir.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.373
This Deliveryman competition
that you planned is,

16:39.373 --> 16:41.083
I mean, it's nothing short of brilliant.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.710
From this point on,

16:44.044 --> 16:46.255
I'd like you to come up
with these brilliant plans.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.590
Yes, sir. I'll try my best.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.313
We got a tip that a generating unit
is being sent to District A.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.487
Once we hear from 6-3, we'll head out.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.213
What the...?

17:36.680 --> 17:39.058
Fricking crazy refugee bastard.
I should run him over.

17:48.692 --> 17:49.943
Where are we moving it?

17:49.943 --> 17:52.154
We're not moving it, we're destroying it.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.541
WAITING FOR SIGNAL

18:26.105 --> 18:27.397
Uh, um, sir.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.653
District A operation test
has a little setback.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.904
What?

18:33.904 --> 18:36.740
The generating unit
was apparently blown up by somebody.

18:39.743 --> 18:40.911
Blown up?

18:40.911 --> 18:42.746
Sir, I'm sorry, uh...

18:42.746 --> 18:44.164
Our men are investigating.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.418
Mr. Oh.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.630
You imbecile!

19:22.703 --> 19:23.912
How are you feeling?

19:24.496 --> 19:25.497
Who came up with all this?

19:28.709 --> 19:31.587
A place where people live this nice
and eat food this good every day.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.590
Who designed this?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.009
Not my idea.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.552
Are they special here?

19:38.552 --> 19:39.720
They were born here.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.764
That makes no sense, though.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.311
Why is being a deliveryman important
to you?

19:48.604 --> 19:49.438
Well--

19:49.438 --> 19:51.899
If you win,
there will be no more hiding for you.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.651
No more worrying
about getting food and air, right?

19:56.153 --> 19:57.946
- Right.
- And what of your friends?

19:58.572 --> 19:59.448
My friends?

20:00.115 --> 20:00.949
- Hey!
- Let's go!

20:00.949 --> 20:03.285
We're future deliverymen!

20:03.285 --> 20:05.245
- Look at the oxygen and masks!
- Good.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.831
They'll ask you the same questions.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.210
"Who decided all this?
If you're different than they are?"

20:24.014 --> 20:26.475
The finals are the only thing
you should think about.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.478
Where are you going?

20:31.021 --> 20:31.980
What's my job here?

20:31.980 --> 20:33.273
Deliveryman.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.359
That's right, and I gotta do my job.

21:18.110 --> 21:22.406
I've heard you asked Intelligence Command
for personal information and bio-data.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.532
I have, yes.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.909
Are you leaving out people
who are inferior?

21:25.909 --> 21:28.328
We can't accommodate everyone
in the relocation plan.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.248
We'll need to make the same choice
that you made.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.500
This choice you're referring to,

21:34.042 --> 21:36.962
do you have any idea
what kind of impact it has?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.673
Those who came here
were 1% of the population.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.384
Ninety-nine percent were abandoned.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.052
Yes, I'm aware.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.556
However, the relocation plan is up to us.

21:47.556 --> 21:51.560
The decision that pained you so much
will be in my hands.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.563
No, the government
will lead the relocation plan.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.648
Every person with a pulse is included,

21:56.648 --> 21:58.317
refugees too, no matter what.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.570
No, Father,
we can't have refugees. Impossible!

22:01.570 --> 22:03.822
The oxygen need...
there would be too much to produce.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.241
Only more oxygen masks
will need to be produced.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.826
You can't be serious!

23:08.762 --> 23:12.099
DANGER, OVERSUPPLY OF OXYGEN

23:21.691 --> 23:23.276
Useless vermin.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.408
<i>You take after me way too much.</i>

23:29.408 --> 23:32.077
What do you expect?
I am your son, you know?

23:32.077 --> 23:33.870
And that there is the issue.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.498
That I can see myself in you.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.377
<i>If you don't like
that I take after you,</i>

23:42.129 --> 23:44.089
<i>then I'll show you a different me.</i>

23:51.179 --> 23:52.722
This is your opponent tomorrow.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.767
Joo Gyeong-nam is
the strongest candidate we've seen so far.

23:56.268 --> 24:00.272
He's got a great physique.
Speed, strength, amazing technique too.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.065
He's good all around.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.277
Stronger than 5-8?

24:05.277 --> 24:06.778
No one's stronger than he is.

24:07.487 --> 24:08.864
Why do you think he's a legend?

24:10.157 --> 24:11.575
I might have a chance, then.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.163
Do you even know what your strength is?

24:17.622 --> 24:18.457
What is it?

24:19.040 --> 24:20.459
It's your blind confidence.

24:22.419 --> 24:23.545
Is that a good thing?

24:25.088 --> 24:27.299
Why do I bother?

24:29.301 --> 24:30.343
Just watch.

24:46.776 --> 24:49.654
They're sending five broadcast trucks
to the Refugee District.

24:50.155 --> 24:53.158
Cheonmyeong's guys are out patrolling.
People are getting nervous.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.910
They're gonna show the finals live?

24:55.994 --> 24:58.163
JOO GYEONG-NAM VS REFUGEE 034

25:00.499 --> 25:03.084
I think they're doing it
because he's a refugee kid, you know?

25:03.084 --> 25:04.920
Did they show it live when we won?

25:05.670 --> 25:07.088
- Nope.
- They didn't.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.258
This all started after 5-7 died.

25:10.842 --> 25:14.054
Once we're done with work today,
let's visit each district to make sure.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.305
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.479
Are you gonna watch it in person?

25:22.479 --> 25:23.980
After my deliveries.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.203
Guys, turn it a little to the left, okay?

25:38.203 --> 25:41.456
Hey, is this way to the left?

25:41.456 --> 25:44.459
No.
Trust me, it's the other way, you idiot.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.588
No, I'm asking
if it's our left or if it's his left.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.799
Uh, why don't we just ask him?

25:51.383 --> 25:52.342
Oh, right.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.429
Hey, Gramps

25:57.180 --> 25:58.265
do you mean our left?

25:58.848 --> 26:00.892
<i>Hey, it's your left, right?</i>

26:02.269 --> 26:04.938
Guys, just turn to whichever side.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.315
Just turn it until I say it's good, okay?

26:07.315 --> 26:08.775
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Okay.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.486
All right, this way.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.198
Hey, is this right?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.493
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You got it, you got it!

26:18.493 --> 26:19.619
Stop! We have a signal!

26:19.619 --> 26:21.538
Gramps! Gramps!

26:25.000 --> 26:26.960
People are going wild out there.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.297
<i>There will be a special
live broadcast of the competition</i>

26:30.297 --> 26:33.049
<i>as a refugee participant
has made it to the final round.</i>

26:33.049 --> 26:35.594
They got it up
on a huge screen out there.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.304
There's presents and free stuff.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.888
- Huh? Free stuff?
- Free stuff?

26:39.556 --> 26:42.601
<i>Oh-ho-ho, Cheonmyeong's looking
after the refugees too?</i>

26:42.601 --> 26:44.311
<i>I want presents too!</i>

26:45.979 --> 26:48.565
<i>We'll be giving away
compressed oxygen and food supplies</i>

26:48.565 --> 26:50.483
<i>to people who watch the competition today.</i>

26:51.735 --> 26:54.070
<i>There will be a special live broadcast
of the competition</i>

26:54.070 --> 26:57.157
<i>as a refugee participant
has made it to the final round.</i>

26:59.075 --> 27:01.995
I don't wanna be anywhere
where there's a really big crowd.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.205
Let's watch it here, huh?

27:04.205 --> 27:05.123
Ugh!

27:14.549 --> 27:17.969
<i>We are now at Core District,
5 km underground.</i>

27:35.737 --> 27:37.155
What is this place?

27:37.822 --> 27:38.907
The Air Road.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.660
You don't need an oxygen mask
in the Core District

27:41.660 --> 27:44.204
because oxygen circulates
throughout this place.

27:59.803 --> 28:00.804
Where are we?

28:07.602 --> 28:09.854
The air
is completely different here.

28:14.401 --> 28:15.694
It's not a vacation.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.903
Stay focused.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.054
Sir, she's here.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.228
Hello, ma'am.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.237
The chairman isn't here.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.364
That's right.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.074
What brings you here?

29:03.074 --> 29:05.910
The relocation plan presentation
is now completed.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.998
That plan's the responsibility
of Cheonmyeong.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.292
I was certain
we had already settled that.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.130
You can't pull off this plan.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.299
I am the president, you know?

29:19.841 --> 29:21.843
And I can do whatever I want.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.936
<i>Did you cross Hannam Bridge?</i>

29:31.936 --> 29:34.564
Crossing over now.
Approaching the delivery center.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.108
Just passed by two black SUVs. Suspicious.

29:37.692 --> 29:40.069
- Why?
-<i>They didn't have license plates</i>.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.988
<i>Headed toward Kyobo Tower intersection.</i>

29:43.072 --> 29:45.408
<i>No plates?
Maybe they're the guys with the tattoos.</i>

29:45.408 --> 29:47.327
What if they're going
to kidnap more kids?

29:47.327 --> 29:48.661
<i>I'll go check it out.</i>

29:53.958 --> 29:55.043
Is it you?

30:17.565 --> 30:18.691
Who the hell are you?

30:18.691 --> 30:19.776
Me?

30:20.735 --> 30:21.820
A deliveryman.

30:22.529 --> 30:23.363
Who are you?

31:44.652 --> 31:46.195
You're not getting me twice.

31:49.198 --> 31:52.327
<i>The final round
of the Deliveryman Selection Competition</i>

31:52.327 --> 31:53.661
will now begin!

32:00.335 --> 32:01.586
<i>A former soldier,</i>

32:01.586 --> 32:02.962
Joo Gyeong-nam!

32:06.257 --> 32:07.842
From the Refugee Districts,

32:09.177 --> 32:10.428
Refugee 034!

32:20.396 --> 32:22.065
<i>Each round is five minutes,</i>

32:22.649 --> 32:25.318
<i>and the final victor
will end the competition.</i>

32:33.034 --> 32:35.244
Each round will last five minutes,

32:35.244 --> 32:37.789
and the competition will only end
with a knockout.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.832
Touch gloves.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.098
Fight!

33:39.809 --> 33:41.686
FINAL ROUND
JOO GYEONG-NAM, REFUGEE 034

34:15.470 --> 34:16.888
Hold yourself together!

34:16.888 --> 34:18.056
Get out of there!

34:18.556 --> 34:19.640
Get up!

34:35.156 --> 34:36.240
Stop!

34:37.033 --> 34:38.618
The first round is over.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.417
This is a bit disappointing.

34:46.959 --> 34:50.129
You put quite a bit of effort
into a pathetic thing like this.

34:50.129 --> 34:53.049
The second round will begin
after a three-minute break.

34:55.218 --> 34:58.096
It's the first round.
These boys are just getting started.

35:00.306 --> 35:02.391
Don't let him get to your chin so easily.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.685
Just wanted to feel a few first.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.355
5-8's stronger.

35:11.818 --> 35:12.735
I got this.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.705
Is what you're doing so huge you'll kill
yourselves when things go wrong?

35:38.052 --> 35:41.597
REPORT YOUR LOCATION

35:47.270 --> 35:48.104
Yes?

35:49.147 --> 35:50.398
Is the plan proceeding?

35:50.982 --> 35:52.650
Yes, sir. The plan is proceeding.

36:19.218 --> 36:20.469
Fight!

36:23.014 --> 36:25.766
Ugh. Wasn't the first round a total bust?

36:27.018 --> 36:27.852
It's okay.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.188
Just one punch knocks this dude out.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.232
Wanna punch me? Then do it.

36:33.232 --> 36:34.817
What the hell are you saying?

You crazy bastard!

38:10.329 --> 38:13.791
They're broadcasting the final round
in order to lure in the refugees?

38:18.045 --> 38:19.588
Those bastards.

38:21.048 --> 38:23.217
This might be the final round.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.139
- Come here
- Yes?

38:40.943 --> 38:42.445

His pattern's obvious.

39:08.888 --> 39:09.722
Good.

39:10.264 --> 39:11.098
Then finish it.

39:18.814 --> 39:21.942
Emergency, everyone.
Get to the closest Refugee District.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.569

39:55.851 --> 39:57.686
<i>Just tell me how to win it.</i>

39:57.686 --> 39:59.188
<i>Prove yourself worthy.</i>
