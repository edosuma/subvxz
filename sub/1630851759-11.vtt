Sonia Sotomayor is Latina,

White like you, Olive.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.677

maybe I'm overthinking it.

Yeah. I'm sure it's
probably nothing.

‐Right, Emmy?
‐Oh no, it's definitely
something.

I got assigned Sonia Sotomayor.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.273
‐Wait, you felt it, too?
‐Yeah.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.526
In fact, I told my
older sister about it,

03:12.526 --> 03:15.696

did is called a microaggression.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.822

race or ethnicity,

Well, sometimes people will
ask my sister where she's from.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.837
When she says
Portland, they'll say,

03:31.837 --> 03:33.755
"But where are
you really from?"

03:33.755 --> 03:36.007
Like someone who looks like us
couldn't possibly be born here.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.802

that's terrible.

she would do
something like that?

microaggressions.

people don't mean to do it.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.122
So, how'd this all get started?

05:31.122 --> 05:32.666
Well, we took
an old storage room

05:32.666 --> 05:34.209
and turned it into
this computer lab.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.504
We also put together a car wash

gone with shorts.

pull off shorts?

Studies project.

you were assigned.

Great. I mean,
it'll be an easy project.

assigned him twice.

anything to do with‐‐

I heard what you all said,

08:59.622 --> 09:01.249
I didn't know what
to do about it.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.751
But then I realized knowing

09:02.751 --> 09:04.044
I wasn't alone made
me feel better.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.462
Me, too.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.213
Before I got Sydney's text,
I didn't even know

09:07.213 --> 09:09.007
what to call this kind of stuff.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.051
And now I know
it's a microaggression.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.054
Yeah. All I knew is that it made
me feel like I didn't belong.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.181
And I usually let them go.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.932
Like this one time, I said

09:17.932 --> 09:19.309
I wanted to be an astronaut,

09:19.309 --> 09:21.728
and my science teacher joked
that I wouldn't like it

09:21.728 --> 09:23.855
because there aren't any
basketballs in space.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.690
I mean, I don't even
play basketball.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.650

'cause you're Black?

09:27.650 --> 09:29.110
Yep. And...

09:30.028 --> 09:32.489
I didn't know what to do,
so I just laughed.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.240
I get that.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.618
People always think
that just because
I'm Asian American

09:36.618 --> 09:37.952
I wanna be a doctor,

09:37.952 --> 09:40.288
but I wanna
direct romantic comedies

09:40.288 --> 09:41.915
and have my own food truck.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.458
That is so you.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.751
I know, right?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.545
I wanna be the queen
of rom‐coms and nom‐noms.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.548
By the way,
"Rom‐Coms and Nom‐Noms,"

09:50.548 --> 09:51.674
perfect food truck name.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.096
I know how you both feel.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.640
Kids actually ask me if
my family sleeps in a tipi

09:58.640 --> 09:59.974
because I'm Native American.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.684
That's like every year
when people wish me

10:01.684 --> 10:03.103
a happy Cinco de Mayo.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.397
I'm not even Mexican.
I'm Cuban and Filipino.

realize how hurtful this is.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.610
You know,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.445
once, a neighbor asked
me if I'm adopted

10:12.445 --> 10:14.989
because my dad's
White, and I'm not.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.908
Made me feel like there was
something wrong with me.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.663
I never knew other
people felt this way.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.915

10:25.708 --> 10:27.502
We've never said anything.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.254
Ms. A needs to know
how we feel.

We've gotta do something.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.696
What happened to yours?

10:54.696 --> 10:56.990
I went to grab it off my porch,

10:56.990 --> 10:58.700
but the neighbor's
dog got it first.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.870

11:01.870 --> 11:03.955
Here, take mine.
And when you're done,

11:03.955 --> 11:06.332
you can finish
the crossword puzzle for me.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.127

you can start it, too.
