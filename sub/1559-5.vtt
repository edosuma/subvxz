00:12.437 --> 00:13.529

00:16.662 --> 00:17.777

_

00:40.619 --> 00:42.820
(Screams)

00:50.796 --> 00:52.268
This... yes, we get it.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.437
Stop panicking. It is unseemly.

00:54.438 --> 00:55.631
Oh,

00:55.632 --> 00:58.160
Yellowstone, Mongolia, Taiwan, China.

00:58.161 --> 00:59.234
And two in Japan.

00:59.235 --> 01:00.643
Who knew earthquakes were magic?

01:00.644 --> 01:01.876
No. Earthquakes are not magic.

01:01.877 --> 01:03.143
They're the result of magic.

01:03.144 --> 01:04.438
My old Slavicâ€™s a little bit rusty,

01:04.440 --> 01:06.146
but I found two other
incidents of massive

01:06.147 --> 01:09.617
geothermal phenomena
dating as far back as 1643.

01:09.618 --> 01:11.151
Colonel Baird, did you find the...

01:11.152 --> 01:13.821
Hold on, my desk reset
itself to Flynn's whatever.

01:13.822 --> 01:15.122
Here! Here, here. Okay.

01:15.123 --> 01:17.992
According to the scroll of Yosemite Sam's.

01:17.993 --> 01:19.660
The folio of Ahwahneechee Yosemite.

01:19.661 --> 01:21.996
Okay. According to it, "water
spirits have been responsible

01:21.997 --> 01:24.832
for these similar weather anomalies

01:24.833 --> 01:28.802
dating back more than five
score and nine years." Score?

01:28.803 --> 01:30.371
- It's 20 years.
- Twenty years.

01:30.372 --> 01:32.139
- It's 20 years.
- I know what a score is.

01:32.140 --> 01:33.440
I was commenting on the use of it.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.675
You are an absolute legend, mate!

01:34.676 --> 01:36.103
That is exactly what we need.

01:36.104 --> 01:36.929
Yes? Good. What?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.193
Some information on the eruptions.

01:38.194 --> 01:40.280
What? No, that was the pizza guy.

01:40.281 --> 01:42.016
All right. I figured if we're
gonna be working all day

01:42.017 --> 01:43.317
and researching, we could use some...

01:43.318 --> 01:45.119
(Thunder crashes)

01:45.120 --> 01:47.553
(Rain spattering)

02:02.169 --> 02:04.437
It's the dragons.

02:08.408 --> 02:10.376
Hey, you got the door working.

02:10.970 --> 02:19.734
Subtitle sync by kategreen <font color="#33FF00">& corrections by
awaqeded</font> for www.addic7ed.com.

02:19.735 --> 02:22.704
- One, two, three. Didn't lose anybody.
- Hell of a time since you've been gone.

02:22.705 --> 02:24.606
I'm finally starting to get
control of my visions.

02:24.607 --> 02:25.707
They are not letting me have any fun.

02:25.708 --> 02:26.908
Jones. Guardian.

02:26.909 --> 02:28.609
- Librarian.
- Jenkins.

02:28.610 --> 02:30.946
Sir, did you come to take them away?
I keep their bags packed.

02:30.947 --> 02:33.915
So these earthquakes and geysers
are being caused by dragons?

02:33.916 --> 02:36.952
Not caused by, they are dragons.

02:36.953 --> 02:39.087
All dragons live beneath the earth.

02:39.088 --> 02:41.423
They sleep 90% of their lives away.

02:41.424 --> 02:42.958
But when angered, they awake.

02:42.959 --> 02:45.227
Jenkins will tell you
they can wreak havoc.

02:45.228 --> 02:46.303
Wait, how much havoc?

02:46.304 --> 02:48.797
If it is dragons, until there
is no more havoc to be wreaked.

02:48.798 --> 02:50.332
Just exactly as I left it.

02:50.333 --> 02:51.600
Yeah, about that...

02:51.601 --> 02:53.735
Eastern dragons, oh, you
never know which side

02:53.736 --> 02:56.338
of the subterranean bed
they're gonna wake up on.

02:56.339 --> 02:59.474
But, Western dragons, albeit
a bit more hot-headed,

02:59.475 --> 03:01.610
see what I did there, hot-headed,

03:01.611 --> 03:02.844
are a bit more consistent.

03:02.845 --> 03:04.679
Sir, if I may respectfully disagree,

03:04.680 --> 03:06.681
Western dragons are thugs, hoarders.

03:06.682 --> 03:09.941
The eastern dragons being elemental
spirits, one can reason with them.

03:09.942 --> 03:11.029
- If you take the time...
- Jenkins!

03:11.030 --> 03:12.443
And Flynn, what are you talking about?

03:12.444 --> 03:15.457
Eastern and Western dragons have been
in a blood feud for 3,000 years.

03:15.458 --> 03:16.841
That's... not dissimilar
to the east coast,

03:16.842 --> 03:19.577
west coast hip hop rivalry
of the late 20th century.

03:19.578 --> 03:21.078
Hmm, Jenkins, you know about hip hop?

03:21.079 --> 03:23.614
Ah, well, as Eric B. and
Rakim so aptly flowed,

03:23.615 --> 03:25.949
"I'm paid in full."

03:27.318 --> 03:29.887
Uh, both types are extremely possessive,

03:29.888 --> 03:33.257
and if something of theirs is
taken, they can react very harshly.

03:33.258 --> 03:33.925
The havoc.

03:33.926 --> 03:35.593
Magic coming back into
the world hasn't helped.

03:35.594 --> 03:38.129
No. The dragons waking
up is apocalyptic enough

03:38.130 --> 03:41.232
that thus it requires some of
the more diplomatic aspects

03:41.233 --> 03:45.536
of librarianism, and thus
my premature return.

03:45.537 --> 03:47.238
Did I just use "thus" twice?

03:47.239 --> 03:48.136
And "librarianism."

03:48.137 --> 03:49.774
Do you have any idea what they've taken?

03:49.775 --> 03:50.571
No, not yet.

03:50.572 --> 03:52.096
Stone, you and Ezekiel,
you got to get on

03:52.097 --> 03:53.151
dragon history and lore.

03:53.152 --> 03:55.780
Cassandra, I want you to focus on
heat signals of the Western dragon.

03:55.781 --> 03:57.982
Jenkins, I'm going to need
my... thank you very much.

03:57.983 --> 03:59.817
And Eve, you have to...

03:59.818 --> 04:01.252
- Stop.
- Not stop, go.

04:01.253 --> 04:02.653
You, stop.

04:02.654 --> 04:04.755
We have to talk.

04:04.756 --> 04:06.489
(Muffled talking)

04:06.770 --> 04:07.938
Argh!

04:07.939 --> 04:09.306
We really don't have time for this.

04:09.307 --> 04:10.307
I'm not even remotely prepared.

04:10.308 --> 04:11.374
Prepared for what?

04:11.375 --> 04:13.143
Not for what, for whom? Mr. Drake.

04:13.144 --> 04:15.345
The eastern dragons' representative
is gonna be here any minute.

04:15.346 --> 04:18.180
A giant, winged, fire-breathing
dragon is coming here?

04:18.182 --> 04:20.450
Well, in the supernatural world,

04:20.451 --> 04:22.586
the library and thus the librarian...

04:22.587 --> 04:23.620
Three thuses.

04:23.621 --> 04:25.021
I know. What is up with that?

04:25.022 --> 04:28.458
Judson used to take care
of all this sort of thing,

04:28.459 --> 04:30.293
but obviously, he's not here.

04:30.294 --> 04:32.796
Flynn, first, how about,
"hello, nice to see you."

04:32.797 --> 04:35.365
Hello, Eve. It's nice to see you.

04:35.366 --> 04:36.877
Nice to see you, too.

04:36.878 --> 04:39.346
Second, Jenkins, myself, and the others,

04:39.347 --> 04:40.914
we're a solid machine here now.

04:40.915 --> 04:42.883
You left the annex in
good hands, remember?

04:42.884 --> 04:44.451
My hands.

04:44.452 --> 04:48.755
Of course, I remember you and
your hands, they're lovely.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.557
Thank you.

04:50.558 --> 04:53.760
My point is, it's not right for you
to just show up from wherever...

04:53.761 --> 04:55.429
Seven seconds in the future actually.

04:55.430 --> 04:56.930
Was that a doorbell?

04:56.931 --> 04:58.699
And just start giving orders.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.267
It undermines my authority.

05:00.268 --> 05:02.035
You want me to start
taking my cues off of you.

05:02.036 --> 05:03.036
Got it.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.805
No, not take cues.

05:04.806 --> 05:06.607
Let's just start at the beginning.

05:06.608 --> 05:07.908
Where have you been?

05:07.909 --> 05:09.309
(Doorbell rings)

05:09.310 --> 05:11.244
When did the annex get a doorbell?

05:11.245 --> 05:12.978
Oh, dear.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.651
Where's Ezekiel?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.487
(Shouts)

05:24.858 --> 05:26.992
No!

05:28.962 --> 05:30.897
Who here speaks for the library?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.929
I do, mate. You got my double
cheese and extra pepperoni?

05:32.930 --> 05:34.301
Me! I do! He doesn't
speak for the library!

05:34.302 --> 05:35.469
I speak for the library.

05:35.470 --> 05:37.101
Who speaks first,
speaks for the library.

05:37.102 --> 05:38.235
Technically, that is true.

05:38.236 --> 05:39.030
That is true technically.

05:39.031 --> 05:40.670
Is there not to be an intercession?

05:40.671 --> 05:42.506
No, I don't believe there should be.

05:42.507 --> 05:44.741
You do not speak for the library.

05:44.742 --> 05:47.244
Is there not to be an intercession?

05:47.245 --> 05:49.279
Intercess all you want, mate,
as long as I'm intercessing

05:49.280 --> 05:51.481
with my double cheese, extra pep.

05:51.482 --> 05:53.450
I'm assuming he doesn't
have my pizza on him.

05:53.451 --> 05:54.951
No. No, he does not.

05:54.952 --> 05:55.986
So he's not the pizza guy?

05:55.987 --> 05:59.054
No. No, he is not.

06:01.705 --> 06:04.842
Let the intercession
of dragons commence.

06:04.843 --> 06:06.409
(Rumbling)

06:10.670 --> 06:13.072
This isn't good, is it?

06:13.073 --> 06:16.467
No. No, it is not.

06:17.507 --> 06:20.276
Okay. So, he's a dragon
in a man costume?

06:20.277 --> 06:21.243
Shh, shh.

06:21.244 --> 06:23.379
He is a lawyer.

06:23.380 --> 06:26.015
I represent the Fei Lung.

06:26.016 --> 06:30.219
Western pigs have stolen the
mystic pearl of the Fei Lung.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.655
So there's pigs and dragons now? Great.

06:32.656 --> 06:35.791
The arbiter of the library
is now on record.

06:35.792 --> 06:37.193
He is not actually the...

06:37.194 --> 06:39.995
You do not speak for the library!

06:39.996 --> 06:41.364
Seriously? Are any of us...

06:41.365 --> 06:43.265
You do not speak for the library.

06:43.266 --> 06:48.204
Only the arbiter can speak.

06:48.205 --> 06:52.641
If the pearl is not returned
by tomorrow's sunset,

06:52.642 --> 06:55.945
I cannot withhold the fury of Fei Lung.

06:55.946 --> 07:00.950
That's why we're gonna get that
pearl back into your hands asap.

07:00.951 --> 07:03.252
- Right, Col. Baird?
- Right, Mr. Carsen.

07:03.253 --> 07:04.786
Psst. Psst.

07:05.888 --> 07:07.623
Yes.

07:07.624 --> 07:11.360
Arbiter, have you selected your
counsel yet for the intercession?

07:11.361 --> 07:13.928
My what?

07:17.187 --> 07:19.123
You mean Jenkins?

07:19.124 --> 07:20.958
Oh, yes. Thank... what...

07:20.959 --> 07:24.524
I gladly accept the honor
of intercession consigliore

07:24.525 --> 07:27.894
for the arbiter of the library.

07:27.895 --> 07:32.465
Arbiter, we will begin the list
of grievances in eight minutes.

07:32.466 --> 07:38.070
Ah, well, what say the
arbiter and the consigliore

07:38.071 --> 07:40.739
stay here with Mr. Drake,
while the rest of us...

07:41.507 --> 07:45.344
(Clicks tongue)

07:45.345 --> 07:46.743
(Clears throat)

07:46.744 --> 07:49.513
May I get you anything to drink?

07:49.514 --> 07:51.615
The tears of our enemies

07:51.616 --> 07:56.720
wrenched from their bodies
as their bones are crushed.

07:56.721 --> 07:58.321
I have Jasmine tea.

07:58.322 --> 07:59.990
Ooh, Jasmine. Yes, please.

07:59.991 --> 08:02.092
Good.

08:02.093 --> 08:03.560
Mr. Drake said mystical pearl.

08:03.561 --> 08:04.961
He represents the eastern dragons,

08:04.962 --> 08:06.763
so I'm guessing the Pearl of Zhou.

08:06.764 --> 08:08.498
If the Western dragons stole it,

08:08.499 --> 08:11.234
their last known stronghold was
in the caverns underneath Rome.

08:11.235 --> 08:14.070
So we are going to Rome to fight
dragons who stole the mystic pearl?

08:14.071 --> 08:15.105
I love this job.

08:15.106 --> 08:17.107
Hopefully not fight, more extraction.

08:17.108 --> 08:18.608
We're talking a heist here.

08:18.609 --> 08:20.810
We're getting it back. It's a repo job.

08:20.811 --> 08:22.379
The one time we absolutely need Jones,

08:22.380 --> 08:23.515
there's no way to pull him free?

08:23.516 --> 08:25.315
No. He is stuck for as long as it takes

08:25.316 --> 08:26.883
to review the dragon's grievances.

08:26.884 --> 08:27.420
(Sighs)

08:27.421 --> 08:29.355
What do you mean grievances?

08:29.356 --> 08:33.259
He's written up a short
list of issues the dragons

08:33.260 --> 08:34.794
have since the last intercession,

08:34.794 --> 08:36.629
which is... when was that?

08:36.630 --> 08:38.636
Oh, yeah, San Francisco, 1906.

08:38.638 --> 08:42.106
The earthquake that
destroyed San Francisco?

08:42.107 --> 08:43.385
Was that before or after?

08:43.385 --> 08:44.820
Because of.

08:44.821 --> 08:47.313
Grievances were not reconciled
and havoc was wreaked.

08:47.314 --> 08:49.914
Mr. Jones, it'd really be
best if I take the lead.

08:49.915 --> 08:51.011
You don't think I can handle this.

08:51.012 --> 08:52.209
Oh, please. I... well, let's see.

08:52.210 --> 08:54.307
Is there a polite way of
saying, "absolutely not?"

08:54.308 --> 08:55.560
You know what, actually, who cares?

08:55.561 --> 08:57.762
- Absolutely not.
- I'm a librarian.

08:57.763 --> 08:59.430
- Jones.
- I can handle this.

08:59.431 --> 09:01.631
Fire up the short list of grievances, mate.

09:06.205 --> 09:07.045
Pew.

09:18.902 --> 09:20.304
Rome.

09:20.305 --> 09:22.372
Damn. See, this was on my bucket list.

09:22.373 --> 09:24.541
The entrance to the dragons' lair is

09:24.542 --> 09:26.610
in a little courtyard off the Vatican.

09:26.611 --> 09:29.012
Last time we're together we
broke into Buckingham Palace

09:29.013 --> 09:30.914
and now we're breaking into the Vatican?

09:30.915 --> 09:33.951
Not into, not into.
We're not breaking into.

09:33.952 --> 09:36.220
Where is the Vatican?

09:36.221 --> 09:37.721
I don't know.

09:37.722 --> 09:39.656
You'd think being up this high,
we could see it from here.

09:39.657 --> 09:42.960
Is that because we're on the Vatican?

09:42.961 --> 09:44.461
(Bell tolls)

09:44.462 --> 09:46.328
Scusi.

09:47.164 --> 09:49.298
We might be on the Vatican.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.304
(Alarm blaring)

09:54.305 --> 09:55.672
Oh, my God. Was that the Pope?

09:55.673 --> 09:56.740
Was that the Pope?

09:56.741 --> 09:58.242
Possibly.

09:58.243 --> 10:00.077
This. This is it. This is the entrance.

10:00.078 --> 10:01.184
Wait, wait, wait. What
are we looking for?

10:01.185 --> 10:01.802
Scusi, scusi, scusi.

10:01.803 --> 10:03.003
We're looking for riddles.

10:03.004 --> 10:04.538
Three things that dragons love.

10:04.539 --> 10:07.207
Sleeping, Russ Meyer movies, and riddles.

10:07.208 --> 10:08.709
Those cops don't sound too happy.

10:08.710 --> 10:10.110
Yeah, I'm thinking it's
definitely the Pope.

10:10.111 --> 10:11.612
Well, I'm not processing
papal possibilities

10:11.613 --> 10:13.814
while we peruse the perimeter
looking for puzzles.

10:13.815 --> 10:15.315
What am I saying?

10:15.316 --> 10:17.351
Six P's? Three thuses?

10:17.352 --> 10:18.786
Wait, p... puzzles.

10:18.787 --> 10:20.401
Puzzles like a series
of stones, some raised

10:20.402 --> 10:21.497
slightly higher than the others?

10:21.498 --> 10:22.920
Like, raised, rising...

10:22.921 --> 10:23.907
- Fibonacci.
- Fibonacci.

10:23.908 --> 10:24.951
- Gesundheit.
- God bless you.

10:24.952 --> 10:26.553
Fibonacci sequence, golden ratios,

10:26.554 --> 10:28.288
golden like honey, honey and bees.

10:28.289 --> 10:29.881
- Honey and oatmeal.
- Cassandra, listen to me.

10:29.882 --> 10:30.732
Cassandra, listen to me.

10:30.733 --> 10:32.667
Hey, the other memory.

10:32.668 --> 10:34.602
- Right.
- The other memory.

10:34.603 --> 10:38.273
Right. Honey, it's bees again
but I'm nine years old.

10:38.274 --> 10:41.076
Ouch. I'm stung. It hurts.

10:41.077 --> 10:42.744
It's dying, but I feel its pain.

10:42.745 --> 10:45.112
The pain. The... I got it.

10:48.516 --> 10:51.453
She didn't lose control?

10:51.454 --> 10:56.925
We've been working on it together.

10:56.926 --> 10:58.426
Oh, I lost it.

10:58.427 --> 11:00.929
I don't know where it is,
it's either the left

11:00.930 --> 11:02.030
or the center, or the right.

11:02.031 --> 11:03.198
I'm not sure which one.

11:03.199 --> 11:05.667
These are not all the same stone.

11:05.668 --> 11:07.105
This is early Roman concrete,

11:07.106 --> 11:08.920
right after they switched from marble.

11:08.921 --> 11:11.891
The ones she pushed
were concrete, not rock.

11:11.892 --> 11:14.759
Like that one. I got it.

11:19.565 --> 11:21.266
(Police radio chatter)

11:24.837 --> 11:26.639
Do you have any idea what's down there?

11:26.640 --> 11:30.442
Nope. That's the best part.

11:31.310 --> 11:33.278
(Whistle blows)

11:42.729 --> 11:44.531
Okay. I think...

11:44.532 --> 11:49.435
That I should go first as guardian.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.928
We didn't hear from you.

11:50.929 --> 11:52.230
Last few weeks you said you were going

11:52.231 --> 11:53.598
to find a way to bring the library back.

11:53.599 --> 11:55.079
Yeah? Well, I'm still working on it.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.516
I'm close. I mean, I'm almost close.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.195
Wait, you could...

11:58.196 --> 12:01.797
I've been getting a lot closer
if I could just get closer.

12:04.262 --> 12:07.097
Hello.

12:07.098 --> 12:08.766
Baird: Three.

12:08.767 --> 12:10.100
Riddle or trap?

12:10.101 --> 12:11.602
Probably both.

12:11.603 --> 12:14.772
I will check. Right, Flynn?

12:14.773 --> 12:16.973
[Clears throat] Yeah, right.

12:18.176 --> 12:20.176
[Click]

12:22.247 --> 12:26.048
That's never a good sound.
[Gasps]

12:28.052 --> 12:30.252
That was close.

12:33.113 --> 12:35.916
This is very familiar.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.618
Okay, well,
what did you do last time?

12:37.619 --> 12:39.386
Well, before, what happened
was it was all sort of

12:39.387 --> 12:40.754
based on a kind of
a rhythm thing.

12:40.755 --> 12:42.721
This is very...
so wh...

12:43.925 --> 12:45.826
Cassandra: Is it over?

12:45.827 --> 12:47.828
Sound!

12:47.829 --> 12:50.631
Ha ha! It's sound.
Sound's what's making it go.

12:50.632 --> 12:52.666
- Huh? I don't understand. - We just
have to keep making lots of noise!

12:52.667 --> 12:54.401
- I'm gonna draw the fire! - What are
you doing besides making me yell?

12:54.402 --> 12:56.702
- What are you doing?
- Aaaah!

12:58.506 --> 12:59.740
What is happening?!

12:59.741 --> 13:01.508
Stone, grab the pearl!

13:01.509 --> 13:03.909
[Screaming]

13:08.883 --> 13:10.116
[Screaming stops]

13:12.487 --> 13:14.321
They're identical!

13:14.322 --> 13:16.223
That's impossible.

13:16.224 --> 13:18.392
Dragons always play by the
rules. There's got to be a clue.

13:18.393 --> 13:19.826
I'm telling you, they look the same.

13:19.827 --> 13:21.861
The boxes are different!

13:23.231 --> 13:24.431
That's...

13:24.432 --> 13:26.667
That's African wood carving.

13:26.668 --> 13:28.535
That's 19th-century Russian.

13:28.536 --> 13:30.470
And that's Asian. That's Asian.

13:30.471 --> 13:32.204
It's Ichiboku style.

13:35.677 --> 13:37.643
Someone please tell me it's over.

13:42.817 --> 13:44.818
Stone, you all right?

13:44.819 --> 13:49.088
Yep. I'm real good.

13:55.964 --> 13:58.765
Stone, what are you doing?
We're not done.

13:58.766 --> 14:00.500
The Lorenzo Museum is here.

14:00.501 --> 14:03.620
They have the biggest collection
of original Divittanis

14:03.621 --> 14:04.671
in the world.

14:04.672 --> 14:07.740
Not that you'd appreciate that.

14:10.445 --> 14:13.447
Is he trying to be like me, doing
the whole kind of cryptic banter...

14:13.448 --> 14:15.482
- No.
- ...'Cause he's not doing it right.

14:15.483 --> 14:17.451
Please stop talking.

14:17.452 --> 14:23.290
Drake: 203... Over-flight privileges
for the North American territories.

14:23.291 --> 14:26.994
Arbiter, what is your response to 203?

14:26.995 --> 14:28.829
- Arbiter!
- Ah! What?

14:28.830 --> 14:30.430
[Doorbell rings]

14:30.431 --> 14:32.998
Finally! Pizza!

14:34.302 --> 14:37.237
He's a terrible arbiter.

14:37.238 --> 14:39.506
Preaching to the choir, bub.

14:39.507 --> 14:41.608
It's not the pizza.

14:41.609 --> 14:44.878
I am Dabra of the City of Bronze,

14:44.879 --> 14:47.748
representative of the Jinn.

14:47.749 --> 14:50.450
- Dabra: I am here for the conclave.
- Conclave?

14:50.451 --> 14:52.352
Someone called a conclave?

14:52.353 --> 14:53.620
Was I deceived?

14:53.621 --> 14:56.323
If so, I will drown the world in blood!

14:56.324 --> 14:57.457
No blood drowning.

14:57.458 --> 14:58.725
Ezekiel: Welcome to the conclave.

14:58.726 --> 15:00.459
No... no. Don't.

15:01.529 --> 15:03.764
This is, uh, Lady Syla...

15:03.765 --> 15:06.700
Sylalandria. Of the Fae Legions.

15:06.701 --> 15:09.735
[Mumbling]

15:11.939 --> 15:13.407
This is, uh...

15:13.408 --> 15:18.845
Cuchlann of the Iron Kingdom.

15:18.846 --> 15:21.714
And...

15:27.388 --> 15:30.257
Oh, now, c-come on. This is just
a bunch of consonants in a row.

15:30.258 --> 15:31.957
That's not... what?

15:33.728 --> 15:36.463
- Someone must have called a quorum.
- Then what's a conclave?

15:36.464 --> 15:39.299
It is a U.N. For all of
the supernatural factions

15:39.300 --> 15:41.935
where they can peaceably
resolve their differences

15:41.936 --> 15:44.871
and over which the arbiter
of the library presides.

15:44.872 --> 15:46.373
Right.

15:46.374 --> 15:47.974
And we're negotiating
with Mr. Drake. Got it.

15:47.975 --> 15:51.478
Hey. You so don't got it.

15:51.479 --> 15:53.280
You know, I warned you.
And per usual, I was ignored.

15:53.281 --> 15:54.581
You know something?

15:54.582 --> 15:56.383
It's fitting that Flynn should show up now

15:56.384 --> 15:58.351
when you people are <i>proving</i>
that you shouldn't even be here.

15:58.352 --> 16:00.454
Be here in your annex. Yeah.

16:00.455 --> 16:02.389
Heard that one before. Not your annex.

16:02.390 --> 16:03.590
<i>Our</i> library.

16:03.591 --> 16:04.891
I'm tired of you making that mistake.

16:04.892 --> 16:06.693
You're not a librarian!

16:06.694 --> 16:08.328
You're a thief!

16:08.329 --> 16:10.664
And a thief who does not
know what he's doing.

16:10.665 --> 16:13.600
I never know what I'm doing.
That's my superpower, mate.

16:13.601 --> 16:16.703
Smarter to be lucky
than lucky to be smart.

16:16.704 --> 16:19.606
Baird: What did that pearl do to Stone?

16:19.607 --> 16:21.241
I wish I knew.

16:21.242 --> 16:24.644
The pearls aren't supposed to
have any magical powers.

16:24.645 --> 16:26.980
- Dead end.
- Huh.

16:26.981 --> 16:29.916
Jenkins' door must have
scrambled my senses.

16:29.917 --> 16:32.352
Okay, that is something I would
have liked to have known

16:32.353 --> 16:34.287
before we broke into...

16:34.288 --> 16:35.822
- <i>Onto.</i>
- ...The Vatican to fight...

16:35.823 --> 16:37.224
- Rob!
- Dragons.

16:37.225 --> 16:38.425
Guys?

16:38.426 --> 16:40.760
That wall just moved by itself.

16:40.761 --> 16:44.531
Also, I don't think it's actually a wall.

16:44.532 --> 16:48.802
<i>Hic debetis non esse, parva.</i>

16:48.803 --> 16:52.305
Uh... Hi. Sorry to... to wake you.

16:52.306 --> 16:54.841
We, uh... and that part
about coming in to rob you,

16:54.842 --> 16:56.676
that was actually a funny story.

16:56.677 --> 16:57.844
Not that funny.

16:57.845 --> 17:01.681
We came to retrieve the pearl.

17:01.682 --> 17:05.685
<i>Margaritam con clepsimus, bibliothecari.</i>

17:05.685 --> 17:08.387
He says they didn't take it.

17:08.388 --> 17:10.290
- But the pearl was here.
- Dragons can't lie.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.659
- It's part of their being magic.
- So, if he's not lying,

17:12.660 --> 17:14.761
then someone is framing
the Western dragons.

17:14.762 --> 17:16.930
See, the things that
come out of my mouth

17:16.931 --> 17:18.531
don't even bother me anymore.

17:18.532 --> 17:21.201
Uh, Mr. dragon, quick question.

17:21.202 --> 17:23.203
Can you at least get us out of here

17:23.204 --> 17:25.539
so we can get the pearl
back to the other dragons

17:25.540 --> 17:28.340
and, you know, stop the apocalypse?

17:28.342 --> 17:30.642
[Laughs]

17:33.781 --> 17:37.284
The definitive collection
of Divittani landscapes

17:37.285 --> 17:40.387
and you've hung "Rain"
next to "Thorn Field."

17:40.388 --> 17:42.489
Are you insane?

17:42.490 --> 17:43.690
- [Speaks Italian]
- Hey.

17:43.691 --> 17:45.625
Stop!

17:45.626 --> 17:47.360
- [Whistle blows]
- Does this look like "Thorn field" to you?

17:47.361 --> 17:50.597
Huh? It's a metaphor.
You people don't appreciate art.

17:50.598 --> 17:51.965
You...

17:51.966 --> 17:53.300
No. Come... come on!

17:53.301 --> 17:54.534
Stone!

17:54.535 --> 17:55.735
[Grunting]

17:55.736 --> 17:57.169
Stone, what's wrong with you?!

17:59.774 --> 18:02.209
[Gasps]

18:02.210 --> 18:04.344
Sorry for the disturbance.

18:04.345 --> 18:07.180
This is a NATO exercise
testing museum security.

18:07.181 --> 18:09.349
We now need to debrief, make
sure we passed.<i> Grazie.</i>

18:09.350 --> 18:10.717
<i>Ciao. Grazie Mille.</i>

18:10.718 --> 18:13.524
All right. Come on, Cassandra.

18:13.525 --> 18:14.888
Cassandra, what is that you have there?

18:14.889 --> 18:16.623
Careful. Whatever was in
that pearl is dangerous.

18:16.624 --> 18:19.226
Oh, no. It's not dangerous.

18:19.227 --> 18:21.827
But I think I am.

18:23.531 --> 18:25.532
- [Gun cocks]
- [Gasps]

18:25.533 --> 18:28.301
[Chuckles]

18:28.302 --> 18:30.570
[Whimpering] A little criticism.

18:30.571 --> 18:34.407
Since I've been back, the
librarians seem kind of evil.

18:34.408 --> 18:35.974
[Conversing in Italian]

18:36.911 --> 18:38.778
[Speaks Italian] It's not them.

18:38.779 --> 18:40.680
It's whatever's inside that pearl.

18:40.681 --> 18:41.881
[Speaks Italian]

18:41.882 --> 18:44.317
And so seconded.

18:44.318 --> 18:48.552
Bam! Next order of business...
motion to allow lupin membership

18:48.553 --> 18:50.991
for both the Guild of Fictional Entities

18:50.992 --> 18:53.226
and the World Crime League
on a provisional basis.

18:53.227 --> 18:55.662
- Do I hear a second?
- Second.

18:55.663 --> 18:57.530
The motion is seconded.
All those in favor?

18:57.531 --> 18:59.566
- All: Aye.
- Motion passes.

18:59.567 --> 19:02.067
Pleasure to be your arbiter.

19:03.504 --> 19:06.605
Dulaque: A request to be recognized.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.715
Ew. Flowers.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.454
Hmm.

19:21.455 --> 19:23.555
Hello, love.

19:28.429 --> 19:31.450
Ezekiel: That's the Dulaque bloke.

19:32.199 --> 19:34.534
Is he eating my extra cheese
and double pepperoni?

19:34.535 --> 19:36.536
He <i> is</i> evil.

19:36.537 --> 19:40.572
Jenkins, you gonna help
me out here or what?

19:47.248 --> 19:50.383
Tick. Tick.

19:50.384 --> 19:52.851
Tick.

19:53.788 --> 19:56.267
Ezekiel Jones.

19:58.574 --> 20:01.911
Does the arbiter recognize me?

20:01.912 --> 20:03.446
Nope. Never seen you before.

20:03.447 --> 20:06.349
The Fae Legions vouchsafe
the son of Ban

20:06.350 --> 20:10.318
and accept his bona fides.

20:12.856 --> 20:18.361
My esteemed colleagues,
entities, extra-planar beings.

20:18.362 --> 20:21.197
These have been trying times,

20:21.198 --> 20:23.966
and yet, how long has it been
since we met in conclave?

20:23.967 --> 20:29.205
Long enough for once
small problems to fester.

20:29.206 --> 20:30.840
And why?

20:30.841 --> 20:35.211
Because the librarian
refused to deal with it.

20:35.212 --> 20:40.883
I submit that the library
has outlived its usefulness.

20:40.884 --> 20:44.153
In fact, if rumor is to be believed,

20:44.154 --> 20:47.223
the current librarian has
lost the library itself.

20:47.224 --> 20:49.225
Only because you attacked it!

20:49.226 --> 20:51.827
An unfounded accusation.

20:51.828 --> 20:56.699
Hardly proper from the arbiter.

20:56.700 --> 21:00.035
Are these the hands we should
be putting our trust in?

21:00.036 --> 21:02.971
What other hands did you have in mind?

21:06.943 --> 21:08.144
[Speaks Italian]

21:08.145 --> 21:09.845
I mean, she's right, you know.

21:09.846 --> 21:13.182
I felt like I had all the
answers, nobody else mattered.

21:13.183 --> 21:17.051
Hubris. It's almost as if...

21:18.455 --> 21:19.922
The apple of discord.

21:20.223 --> 21:21.991
The apple of discord,

21:21.992 --> 21:24.293
created by the goddess
Erys to wreak havoc.

21:24.294 --> 21:26.829
Although she was afraid of blowback,
so it doesn't really change you,

21:26.830 --> 21:28.764
but it does turn you into
the worst version of yourself.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.766
So you're saying I'm gonna
break somebody's skull

21:30.767 --> 21:32.034
over misinterpreted landscape?

21:32.035 --> 21:34.236
Hate the apple, not the librarian.

21:34.237 --> 21:37.373
Okay. Two things. One... we're never
allowed in this museum again.

21:37.374 --> 21:39.875
- Well, that makes sense.
- And secondly... Ezekiel Jones

21:39.876 --> 21:42.178
can never touch whatever that thing was.

21:42.179 --> 21:44.156
The apple of discord.
We have to get to Cassandra.

21:44.157 --> 21:45.414
Right.

21:45.415 --> 21:48.484
Only the good news is, how bad
could evil Cassandra really be?

21:48.485 --> 21:52.221
You look different.

21:52.222 --> 21:55.490
Oh, you have no idea.

21:56.326 --> 22:01.664
Radii, ratio, power,
force, four, four square,

22:01.665 --> 22:06.001
Molly Ronder took my ball
and forced me to cry at school,

22:06.002 --> 22:10.806
school, numbers, input, effort, load.

22:10.807 --> 22:12.141
What are you doing? [Laughs]

22:12.142 --> 22:14.677
Do you know what force ratios are?

22:14.678 --> 22:16.345
Mass, inertia, velocity?

22:16.346 --> 22:18.747
You should really look it up.

22:18.748 --> 22:22.084
In this case, I'm thinking,
oh, eight pounds per.

22:22.085 --> 22:24.119
You brought this on yourself.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.222
- [Laughs]
- [Grunts]

22:26.223 --> 22:27.690
Dislocated wrist.

22:27.691 --> 22:30.091
Eight pounds of pressure per square inch.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.527
[Grunts] Ah!

22:33.897 --> 22:35.698
Saphenous nerve cluster.

22:35.699 --> 22:39.033
Three pounds of pressure per inch.

22:39.769 --> 22:43.305
And six pounds of pressure
to the carotid artery

22:43.306 --> 22:46.242
stops blood flow to the brain.

22:46.243 --> 22:49.144
[Giggles]

22:49.145 --> 22:50.645
This is unsatisfying.

22:51.715 --> 22:55.050
I do like this force-ratio thing.

22:55.051 --> 22:57.353
What to do?

22:57.354 --> 22:59.121
[Chuckles]

22:59.122 --> 23:01.056
A power plant.

23:01.057 --> 23:03.124
It's perfect.

23:04.895 --> 23:06.328
You know something?

23:06.329 --> 23:08.964
Every lecture, you make
everyone feel like idiots,

23:08.965 --> 23:11.100
but you slide just enough hints in there

23:11.101 --> 23:13.035
to point us in the right direction.

23:13.036 --> 23:14.236
You want to help us.

23:14.237 --> 23:16.805
Good luck in prison.

23:16.806 --> 23:18.173
But at the same time,

23:18.174 --> 23:20.876
you act like you're better
than everyone else.

23:20.877 --> 23:24.179
Complain about how we're in
<i>your</i> way, invading <i> your</i> annex.

23:24.180 --> 23:27.716
You know, I could never figure
out the real you until now.

23:27.717 --> 23:30.019
The real you is a coward.

23:30.020 --> 23:33.188
I am <i> not</i> a coward, not for
leaving this situation.

23:33.189 --> 23:36.025
- You do not know...
- Not a coward for <i> leaving</i>

23:36.026 --> 23:37.927
but for not choosing between the two.

23:37.928 --> 23:40.162
Interesting lecture for
a man who can't decide

23:40.163 --> 23:42.431
whether he's going to be
a thief or a librarian.

23:42.432 --> 23:45.100
Yeah? Well, this librarian

23:45.101 --> 23:47.002
is going back in there
to save this place,

23:47.003 --> 23:48.771
and this thief is going back in there

23:48.772 --> 23:50.039
to take Dulaque down a peg.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.207
Neither one's running away.

23:52.208 --> 23:54.376
I did choose.

23:54.377 --> 23:56.412
[Trunk slams]

23:56.413 --> 23:58.579
Once.

24:00.350 --> 24:04.420
I chose a side in a very complicated...

24:04.421 --> 24:06.889
[Chuckles]

24:06.890 --> 24:08.724
I chose.

24:08.725 --> 24:10.926
No good came of it.

24:10.927 --> 24:16.699
And over the years, I
chose again and again.

24:16.700 --> 24:21.904
Each time, a little hope, lots of blood.

24:21.905 --> 24:25.808
But nothing really changed.

24:25.809 --> 24:29.812
I finally learned my lesson.

24:29.813 --> 24:32.380
And I came here...

24:33.683 --> 24:38.053
...just to do my work alone...

24:38.054 --> 24:40.856
Because why choose?

24:40.857 --> 24:44.026
Nothing... oh, God.

24:44.027 --> 24:48.896
Nothing... ever changes.

24:51.401 --> 24:55.469
[Sighs] You did.

24:59.776 --> 25:01.210
Baird: Lamia?

25:01.211 --> 25:03.611
[Gasping]

25:05.248 --> 25:08.117
What did you do to Cassandra?

25:08.118 --> 25:10.185
The question is,

25:10.186 --> 25:13.287
what can your girl do
with a power plant?

25:14.357 --> 25:15.891
Seriously.

25:15.892 --> 25:17.760
You know she tried to kill me, right?

25:17.761 --> 25:19.026
She tried to kill me, too.

25:22.265 --> 25:24.333
[Whirring]

25:24.334 --> 25:28.203
Population... 2.8 million.

25:28.204 --> 25:33.042
But if we take a concentric step down...

25:33.043 --> 25:34.710
[Alarm blares]

25:34.711 --> 25:38.681
...gives us a wider dispersal
progression past Rome.

25:38.682 --> 25:40.514
[Chuckles]

25:47.661 --> 25:49.330
You stole my pizza!

25:49.331 --> 25:51.365
I motion to close the floor.

25:51.366 --> 25:53.767
Thank you, librarian.
I second the motion.

25:53.768 --> 25:56.237
Which means it's time to call for a vote

25:56.238 --> 26:00.307
to remove the librarians
as arbiters of the conclave.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.509
- Wait, no. I move to reopen the floor.
- Objection.

26:02.510 --> 26:04.777
- I mean, we...
- Jenkins: Point of order.

26:05.614 --> 26:07.948
The Yalta Resolution of 1123 states that

26:07.949 --> 26:11.819
no conclave can begin without first reading
the minutes of the previous conclave.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.387
Dulaque: That should happen at
the beginning of the meeting.

26:13.388 --> 26:14.989
As noted in the second amendment

26:14.990 --> 26:17.658
of the Wold Newton bylaws
section "C," paragraph nine,

26:17.659 --> 26:21.262
in case of a transition
between negotiations...

26:21.263 --> 26:23.497
you declared a conclave.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.699
Mr. Drake properly
declared an intercession.

26:25.700 --> 26:29.436
However, Mr. Jones did not
properly announce the conclave,

26:29.437 --> 26:31.405
so we have skipped the minutes.

26:31.406 --> 26:35.643
After all, he is a terrible arbiter.

26:35.644 --> 26:36.977
Hmm.

26:36.978 --> 26:40.247
Wouldn't do to muck about with protocol.

26:40.248 --> 26:42.683
You'll find the minutes in section "F,"

26:42.684 --> 26:45.952
shelve 23, if you please.

26:47.589 --> 26:50.658
Well, this could take awhile.

26:50.659 --> 26:52.426
[All sigh]

26:52.427 --> 26:53.927
Silly.

26:53.928 --> 26:56.897
You have to dump the trains and
the municipal grids first.

26:56.898 --> 26:59.333
Cassandra?

26:59.334 --> 27:01.502
Hey, guys.

27:01.503 --> 27:03.370
Guess you found me, huh?

27:03.371 --> 27:04.805
What you doing?

27:04.806 --> 27:08.208
Oh, I was just gonna use this
one little power station

27:08.209 --> 27:10.444
to set up a cascade failure
of Europe's power grid.

27:10.445 --> 27:11.645
Cool, huh?

27:11.646 --> 27:13.414
Bonus points if I can jump the channel

27:13.415 --> 27:15.582
and shut down London.

27:15.583 --> 27:16.950
[Alarm blaring] If this is what
the apple does to Cassandra,

27:16.951 --> 27:18.719
we are definitely not letting Ezekiel

27:18.720 --> 27:19.987
- get his hands on it.
- No.

27:19.988 --> 27:21.789
Well, that's gonna hurt a lot of folks.

27:21.790 --> 27:25.893
Uh-huh. Death-toll estimates are
between 680,000 and 845,000,

27:25.894 --> 27:28.495
give or take, depending on the
number of electrocutions.

27:28.496 --> 27:32.866
But, oh, the total and complete
infrastructure collapse...

27:32.867 --> 27:35.703
mm... that's gonna be the yummiest.

27:35.704 --> 27:37.571
- Why, Cassandra?
- Duh.

27:37.572 --> 27:40.407
Because practical applications
are more fun than theories.

27:40.408 --> 27:42.843
See, I have this gift,

27:42.844 --> 27:47.881
and it lets me calculate
everything, see everything.

27:47.882 --> 27:51.618
And yet I never take it all the way down.

27:51.619 --> 27:53.487
Now zip it, Blondie.

27:53.488 --> 27:54.722
I'm thinking.

27:54.723 --> 27:58.959
In rings of rocks and quarks.

27:58.960 --> 28:02.796
Cassandra, what's the last digit in PI?

28:02.797 --> 28:04.798
There isn't one. Pi is irrational.

28:04.799 --> 28:06.983
No, I'm... I'm pretty sure that there is.

28:06.984 --> 28:08.635
What's the... the other one?

28:08.636 --> 28:11.542
Euler's number, it ends with a 6?

28:11.543 --> 28:13.737
I just said Pi is irrational.

28:13.738 --> 28:15.112
If you <i> really</i> think about it...

28:15.113 --> 28:18.479
<i>if</i> I think about it? If? [Laughs]

28:18.480 --> 28:24.752
See, I am <i> always</i> thinking about
everything all of the time!

28:24.753 --> 28:29.690
I have all of the numbers
inside of my head!

28:29.691 --> 28:33.629
So I am not some stupid Sci-Fi robot

28:33.630 --> 28:35.963
that you can put into a recursive loop

28:35.964 --> 28:39.900
with some dumb trick like...

28:39.901 --> 28:42.735
Did you say 6?

28:49.444 --> 28:52.646
Euler was the off switch, not Pi.

28:52.647 --> 28:54.648
Well, she writes a lot
in this little notebook,

28:54.649 --> 28:55.849
and I pay attention.

28:55.850 --> 28:57.251
Apple.

28:57.252 --> 28:59.186
Apple! All right.

28:59.187 --> 29:01.422
What happened to my clothes?

29:01.423 --> 29:04.391
Oh. Here.

29:04.392 --> 29:06.458
All right, come on.

29:08.897 --> 29:11.398
- Whoa.
- Hello.

29:11.399 --> 29:14.660
You thinking what I'm thinking?

29:14.661 --> 29:17.061
Yeah. Ditch the snot-nosed sidekicks,

29:17.062 --> 29:19.351
get ourselves a penthouse
with room service and a view?

29:19.352 --> 29:20.491
But first we take over the world?

29:20.492 --> 29:21.341
I like this plan.

29:21.342 --> 29:22.643
Oh, your world or mine?

29:22.644 --> 29:25.813
Well, mine's bigger.

29:25.814 --> 29:27.214
[Grunts]

29:27.215 --> 29:29.249
- Ooh!
- Bigger isn't always better.

29:29.250 --> 29:32.352
Well, both then. After
all, we need the power.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.955
You don't get to just
walk in and take charge.

29:34.956 --> 29:39.259
<i>I</i> am in charge.
I do the job every day!

29:39.260 --> 29:41.962
I'm in charge because I wield
the power of the library,

29:41.963 --> 29:43.730
and you can't even imagine the burden...

29:43.731 --> 29:45.966
You run around like a half-wit clown...

29:45.967 --> 29:48.602
- you'd die without me, literally dead!
- Half-wit clown?! If it wasn't for me,

29:48.603 --> 29:50.704
you would still be a civilian
with no sense of magic!

29:50.705 --> 29:52.606
Oh! Ooh!

29:52.607 --> 29:55.342
Eve, wait! Wait!

29:55.343 --> 29:56.810
[Gun cocks]

29:56.811 --> 29:58.846
If I have the responsibility,
I get the command,

29:58.847 --> 30:03.516
and you all need to shut
up and follow orders!

30:07.555 --> 30:09.228
I could cut you to ribbons.

30:09.229 --> 30:11.684
What is going on with this day?

30:11.685 --> 30:13.894
Flynn, please don't kill Lamia.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.497
Yes. Listen to your guardian.

30:16.498 --> 30:19.038
"Listen to your guardian."
"Don't kill the Lamia."

30:19.039 --> 30:20.400
You're not worth my time!

30:20.401 --> 30:22.035
None of you are worth my time.

30:22.036 --> 30:24.004
When I think of all the sacrifice,

30:24.005 --> 30:29.742
all the years, the magic I
know, I could be a God!

30:33.914 --> 30:35.849
Motion to accept
cellular-phone technology

30:35.850 --> 30:38.915
as a formal branch of
wizardry was accepted by...

30:38.916 --> 30:40.020
Enough!

30:40.021 --> 30:42.222
I move to accept the minutes and
return to the business at hand.

30:42.223 --> 30:44.524
I'd rather hear the rest of the minutes.

30:44.525 --> 30:45.925
You refuse to call for a vote?

30:45.926 --> 30:47.193
- Yes.
- No.

30:47.194 --> 30:49.963
A motion has been made and seconded

30:49.964 --> 30:51.931
but refuses to call for a vote.

30:51.932 --> 30:54.367
The arbiter is out of order.

30:54.368 --> 30:57.137
I call for an immediate vote of
no confidence in the arbiter

30:57.138 --> 30:59.305
and, by extension, the librarians.

30:59.306 --> 31:02.975
I call for a vote to end the library!

31:07.007 --> 31:08.507
Flynn, you're not thinking straight.

31:08.508 --> 31:10.624
Thinking straight? I've never
thought straighter in my life.

31:10.625 --> 31:13.561
Last chance, Eve. You and me
and all the magic in the world.

31:13.562 --> 31:18.032
But bring something that
shows a <i> little</i> skin for once.

31:18.033 --> 31:20.411
No? <i> Ciao.</i>

31:22.504 --> 31:24.271
[Sighs]

31:24.272 --> 31:26.240
Lamia: You know, between us girls,

31:26.241 --> 31:29.976
evil Flynn's a little... You know.

31:31.446 --> 31:33.463
Do I have a second?

31:33.464 --> 31:35.440
Aye.

31:35.441 --> 31:37.923
You don't even know
what you're voting for.

31:37.924 --> 31:39.992
Oh, no, Mr. Drake?

31:39.993 --> 31:41.994
Nice pair of clichÃ©s
on your feet, by the way.

31:41.995 --> 31:45.697
This is a conclave, and Dulaque
has called for a vote

31:45.698 --> 31:50.783
which could only be a vote
of no confidence, which means...

31:52.972 --> 31:54.306
You three again.

31:54.307 --> 31:56.542
Out! Out, I say!

31:56.543 --> 31:59.044
Out, minions! Out, imposters!

31:59.045 --> 32:01.746
Daddy's home!

32:03.082 --> 32:04.583
Where was I?

32:04.584 --> 32:08.086
Ah, yes. I'm the librarian.

32:08.087 --> 32:10.455
Not that broken-down chicken little

32:10.456 --> 32:12.658
and not his highly overrated
criminal companion.

32:12.659 --> 32:14.626
Me.

32:14.627 --> 32:17.796
The librarian, the big no-o-o-o-o-ise!

32:17.797 --> 32:19.731
How are you, Dabra?

32:19.732 --> 32:21.900
Still cheating on those
seven wives of yours?

32:21.901 --> 32:24.469
Doing that whole "drowning
the world in blood" thing

32:24.470 --> 32:26.804
every time you're feeling
a little insecure?

32:28.074 --> 32:29.908
Why, Lady Syl.

32:29.909 --> 32:31.877
Still working on those
self-esteem issues

32:31.878 --> 32:33.478
by throwing yourself at...

32:33.479 --> 32:34.912
Dulaque: Enough!

32:35.915 --> 32:39.117
Is that word even in your vocabulary?

32:39.118 --> 32:41.887
Never mind.

32:41.888 --> 32:43.455
Flynn: If you want it...

32:43.456 --> 32:46.425
I mean, if you really
want it, you can have it.

32:46.426 --> 32:47.960
Take it.

32:47.961 --> 32:49.761
Take the library, take the books,

32:49.762 --> 32:51.964
take the artifacts, take
the responsibility!

32:51.965 --> 32:53.565
I don't want it!

32:53.566 --> 32:59.638
I have seen things... magic and power.

32:59.639 --> 33:05.109
Do you honestly think that any
single one of you could take me?

33:06.379 --> 33:08.447
- Are you ill?
- Ha!

33:08.448 --> 33:10.549
I've never felt better in my life.

33:10.550 --> 33:12.317
How clear is my thinking?

33:12.318 --> 33:14.987
How good do I feel? How good do I look?

33:14.988 --> 33:17.856
We need to get that apple away from him.

33:17.857 --> 33:19.491
It makes people evil.

33:19.492 --> 33:22.628
- I can get it.
- I don't think so.

33:22.629 --> 33:25.597
Last thing we need right
now is an evil you.

33:25.598 --> 33:28.867
Well, someone has to get
that apple away from him.

33:28.868 --> 33:30.969
As I said to Jane Addams once

33:30.970 --> 33:33.805
during a very aggressive
game of croquet,

33:33.806 --> 33:39.643
the best offense is really
just a good... offense.

33:42.915 --> 33:48.854
The presidency would be easy,
but that's not real power.

33:48.855 --> 33:52.391
Presidency of the world, all the
nations answering to me, yes.

33:52.392 --> 33:55.460
And think of the wardrobe.

33:55.461 --> 33:58.530
You're a disgrace to this
library and to Judson.

33:58.531 --> 33:59.798
Now release that apple.

33:59.799 --> 34:02.734
Oh, you don't say that name.

34:02.735 --> 34:05.604
In fact, I don't even really know

34:05.605 --> 34:09.273
why I let you stay here, you
miserable charity case!

34:11.577 --> 34:14.313
Now, I call for a vote of no confidence,

34:14.313 --> 34:18.684
and I expect each and every one
of you pathetic excuses...

34:18.685 --> 34:20.619
Yes, Flynn?

34:20.620 --> 34:24.956
- Uh...
- Let me finish.

34:24.956 --> 34:28.860
Pathetic excuses for <i> bad,</i>
because you're all wonderful.

34:28.860 --> 34:32.898
And we need to put all
this foolishness behind us

34:32.899 --> 34:35.600
before things get out of hand.

34:35.601 --> 34:38.570
Um, unrestrained magic can be dangerous.

34:38.571 --> 34:41.639
I mean, all it really
takes is one lunatic,

34:41.641 --> 34:43.108
one Pol Pot, one Nero,

34:43.109 --> 34:46.011
one apple-wielding,
overworked, unappreciative,

34:46.012 --> 34:48.380
but genuinely kind of a nice guy

34:48.380 --> 34:51.783
who has access to that kind of
power to make it all go away.

34:51.784 --> 34:55.353
And it <i> can</i> all go away, unless...

34:55.355 --> 34:58.623
and this is really the takeaway
here... we have a library.

34:58.624 --> 35:02.928
And that is why we need
a librarian, right?

35:02.929 --> 35:05.330
To protect us.

35:05.331 --> 35:07.833
To protect us all.

35:07.834 --> 35:11.536
You pick-pocketed the apple?

35:11.537 --> 35:12.938
Yeah.

35:12.939 --> 35:14.740
Jenkins distracted him.

35:14.741 --> 35:16.641
Pretty neat.

35:16.642 --> 35:18.443
- Are you evil?
- No.

35:18.444 --> 35:20.645
Don't feel any different.

35:20.646 --> 35:21.913
Are you immune?

35:21.914 --> 35:24.616
No, he's already...

35:24.617 --> 35:26.818
the worst version of himself.

35:26.819 --> 35:29.521
You say that like it's a <i> bad</i> thing.

35:29.522 --> 35:31.056
What were you thinking?

35:31.057 --> 35:34.526
I was actually just thinking
that I now appreciate

35:34.527 --> 35:38.162
the advantage of having
both a librarian and a thief.

35:42.068 --> 35:45.370
Librarians aren't perfect.
None of us are.

35:45.371 --> 35:47.973
Somebody needs to hold the line.

35:47.974 --> 35:50.942
Somebody needs to keep
it on an even keel.

35:50.943 --> 35:53.345
And that being said, Mr. arbiter,

35:53.346 --> 35:55.947
I believe we have a motion on the floor.

35:55.948 --> 36:00.852
All in favor of replacing
the librarians or whatever.

36:00.853 --> 36:02.988
All opposed.

36:02.989 --> 36:04.389
All: Nay!

36:04.390 --> 36:05.791
Sounds pretty unanimous to me.

36:05.792 --> 36:06.890
No!

36:08.327 --> 36:10.028
We don't agree.

36:10.029 --> 36:11.663
Our business is not done.

36:11.664 --> 36:14.466
You have not returned the
stolen pearl of the Fei Lung.

36:14.467 --> 36:18.403
You have not fulfilled
your duties as arbiter.

36:18.404 --> 36:20.806
And for that, the Fei Lung
will wreak horrible vengeance.

36:20.807 --> 36:21.606
They will...

36:21.607 --> 36:24.643
shouldn't you have bolted the
minute this turned up, mate?

36:24.644 --> 36:27.612
You see, ladies, gents,

36:27.613 --> 36:29.815
the minute I heard the
story of the stolen pearl,

36:29.816 --> 36:31.750
my very good thief
brain began thinking,

36:31.751 --> 36:34.386
who had access?

36:34.387 --> 36:36.688
Who do the eastern dragons trust?

36:36.689 --> 36:39.089
Any idea who that could be, Mr. Drake?

36:56.742 --> 36:59.743
[Chuckles]

37:00.813 --> 37:05.283
And that, my dear friends,
is how you arbit.

37:05.284 --> 37:07.052
Arbit?

37:07.053 --> 37:10.021
Arbitrize. Right!

37:10.022 --> 37:12.591
Conclave over!

37:12.592 --> 37:16.126
Everybody out!

37:19.298 --> 37:23.033
I know this was you.

37:24.804 --> 37:27.072
All of it.

37:27.073 --> 37:30.709
Mr. Drake stealing the
pearl, the conclave,

37:30.710 --> 37:33.812
trying to take the library.

37:33.813 --> 37:36.648
Was I that transparent?

37:36.649 --> 37:38.884
You woke the dragons.
Are you insane?

37:38.885 --> 37:41.086
They would have destroyed the world.

37:41.087 --> 37:45.457
60%. 65% at most.

37:45.458 --> 37:47.925
It's not too late, you know.
You can still join me.

37:52.798 --> 37:56.601
The conclave is over, Mr. Dulaque.

37:56.602 --> 38:00.438
Of course, our sides have
always been chosen for us,

38:00.439 --> 38:02.005
haven't they?

38:04.277 --> 38:07.946
No. We choose.

38:07.947 --> 38:10.916
1,000 years ago.

38:10.917 --> 38:12.918
You know that very moment

38:12.919 --> 38:16.488
when you [Sighs] and I

38:16.489 --> 38:20.458
stopped being... Whatever we were.

38:20.459 --> 38:22.527
If I hadn't tried,

38:22.528 --> 38:26.530
I'd actually be the
monster you think I am.

38:33.005 --> 38:35.539
Travel well.

38:49.388 --> 38:50.956
Half-wit clown here.

38:50.957 --> 38:53.258
Hey, people like clowns.

38:53.259 --> 38:56.226
Really? Name one.

38:58.764 --> 39:01.533
Transfer papers?

39:01.534 --> 39:02.801
Well, you're still a member

39:02.802 --> 39:05.003
of the NATO counterterrorism group.

39:05.004 --> 39:06.705
Sign those papers

39:06.706 --> 39:09.507
and you're permanently
transferred to the library.

39:09.508 --> 39:12.209
Tear them up and you can leave tomorrow.

39:14.814 --> 39:16.514
[Sighs]

39:16.515 --> 39:17.749
What brought this on?

39:17.750 --> 39:19.484
I'm giving you a choice.

39:19.485 --> 39:22.387
I met you, we recruited
you, I gave you a job,

39:22.388 --> 39:24.889
and then I took off,
and that's no way...

39:24.890 --> 39:26.558
that's not how... that's...

39:26.559 --> 39:29.628
that's not... I want to
treat like an equal.

39:29.629 --> 39:31.329
You're out of practice being with people.

39:31.330 --> 39:32.831
Well, I'm out of practice being a person.

39:32.832 --> 39:34.766
But you...

39:34.767 --> 39:37.302
You've really built something here.

39:37.303 --> 39:40.305
I mean, Stone knows Cassandra well
enough to help her with her visions.

39:40.306 --> 39:42.807
Ezekiel Jones and Jenkins
working together?

39:42.808 --> 39:44.542
- Are you kidding me?
- Right?

39:44.543 --> 39:46.311
Listen, they listen to you,

39:46.312 --> 39:49.481
and it's because you're here
and you're... Doing the job.

39:49.482 --> 39:52.917
This is your space now, not mine.

39:52.918 --> 39:54.319
[Chuckles] Well...

39:54.320 --> 39:55.854
Try telling the desk that.

39:55.855 --> 39:57.822
It hasn't quite figured that out.

39:57.823 --> 39:59.924
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

39:59.925 --> 40:02.759
I'll stay if you stay.

40:11.103 --> 40:13.705
How did you know that I had a pen?

40:13.706 --> 40:16.139
'Cause I pay attention.

40:17.009 --> 40:19.910
I'll stay. But you go.

40:21.113 --> 40:22.614
Go back out.

40:22.615 --> 40:24.616
Well, I'm gonna stay if I want to stay

40:24.617 --> 40:25.884
'cause librarian/library...

40:25.885 --> 40:27.552
We had two missions.

40:27.553 --> 40:29.087
Mine was to train them,
and they're doing okay.

40:29.088 --> 40:30.789
Oh, I'd say they're doing
better than okay. In fact, I...

40:30.790 --> 40:32.524
Yours was to find the library.

40:32.525 --> 40:35.527
And I look in your eyes, and
I know you haven't given up.

40:35.528 --> 40:36.728
Not yet.

40:36.729 --> 40:41.566
Go finish your mission.

40:41.567 --> 40:44.035
Are you sure? Are you really sure?

40:44.036 --> 40:46.037
Absolutely. If there's one thing I know,

40:46.038 --> 40:48.572
it's when a mission's not
done, and yours just isn't.

40:55.715 --> 40:59.182
Or maybe I'm wrong. May...

41:04.623 --> 41:07.524
Come back alive, librarian.

41:11.864 --> 41:14.432
Oh, come on!

41:14.433 --> 41:16.124
[Sighs]
