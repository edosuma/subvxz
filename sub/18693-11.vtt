00:06.227 --> 00:07.824
Previously on Shadowhunters...

00:07.878 --> 00:09.411
Valentine wants to
use the soul sword

00:09.446 --> 00:10.890
to decimate the entire
Downworld, and he needs.

00:10.914 --> 00:11.880
Clary to activate it.

00:11.915 --> 00:14.683
I'm losing my patience.

00:14.718 --> 00:17.488
- Simon, drink.
- Stop them!

00:20.281 --> 00:21.737
If Jace touches the sword,

00:21.811 --> 00:23.645
his grip would destroy it.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.690
Jace's plan is gonna work.

00:24.714 --> 00:25.647
Let's move!

00:25.682 --> 00:27.615
Jace! It'll kill you!

00:28.685 --> 00:30.585
He activated it.

00:35.892 --> 00:38.693
You didn't inject me with demon
blood, it was angel blood!

00:38.728 --> 00:41.663
You are not my son.
Clary is not your sister.

00:42.766 --> 00:43.665
Jace, don't.

00:43.700 --> 00:44.799
The mortal cup is still

00:44.834 --> 00:47.515
still out there.
He's the only one who knows where it is.

You're hurting.

01:19.197 --> 01:20.210
You didn't even touch me.

01:20.304 --> 01:21.333
I'm not talking about that.

01:21.357 --> 01:22.757
I'm talking about
the Downworlders.

01:24.275 --> 01:26.241
Jace, you didn't know.

01:26.277 --> 01:27.309
Wasn't your fault.

01:27.344 --> 01:28.344
I never said it was.

01:29.647 --> 01:32.127
Come on, you got another round
in you or Startin' to get tired?

01:38.255 --> 01:40.200
So what does this pure angel
blood do for you anyway?

01:40.224 --> 01:42.324
I don't know,
other than the ability to activate

01:42.359 --> 01:44.426
that sword.
Maybe that's all it's good for.

01:44.461 --> 01:47.229
Clary's got the ability
to draw new runes,

01:47.264 --> 01:49.331
so you must be able to
do something special.

01:49.366 --> 01:51.400
You mean,
other than kick your ass?

♪ Watch this ♪

02:03.314 --> 02:05.280

02:10.287 --> 02:11.287
♪ Watch this ♪

02:18.262 --> 02:20.229
So you gonna tell Clary?

02:20.264 --> 02:21.230
Tell her what?

02:21.265 --> 02:23.232
She's not your sister.

02:25.469 --> 02:27.302
Ah! Ah!

02:27.338 --> 02:29.304
- You're the only person I've told.
- You know,

02:29.340 --> 02:32.407
She's lost so much.
She's got a good thing going with Simon.

02:35.346 --> 02:37.034
You know I wouldn't
wanna ruin that.

02:39.283 --> 02:41.383
You think you're so
irresistible she's gonna

02:41.418 --> 02:43.498
dump him as soon as she
finds out you're not related.

02:46.323 --> 02:49.944
I think you should worry a
little less about my love life...

02:51.428 --> 02:54.263
and a little more about
your fighting skills.

03:03.340 --> 03:05.407
I don't think the sun
has ever felt this good.

03:05.442 --> 03:08.176
Yeah.

03:09.380 --> 03:11.413
Hey. Look at us.

03:11.482 --> 03:14.316
On our favourite
bench, in the day.

03:16.353 --> 03:18.320
We're like a normal couple!

03:20.324 --> 03:21.290
It's funny how normal

03:21.325 --> 03:22.502
doesn't even feel
normal anymore.

03:22.526 --> 03:26.428
I'm not even a normal vampire.
I'm a freak of vamp nature.

03:26.463 --> 03:28.430
You are not a freak.

03:28.465 --> 03:31.233
You're unique.

03:31.268 --> 03:34.336
Special. Sexy.

03:34.371 --> 03:36.416
Don't you think there has
to be some sort of downside?

03:36.440 --> 03:38.407
We've already seen the
downside, Simon.

03:39.477 --> 03:42.311
It's... it's time to start
focussing on the upside.

03:42.376 --> 03:43.318
My Bubbie Helen always
says there are no

03:43.324 --> 03:45.545
handouts in life,
that everything comes with a price.

03:45.570 --> 03:47.503
Well,
that is not necessarily true.

03:48.153 --> 03:50.198
What if I'm walking to the
subway and then next thing

03:50.222 --> 03:52.189
I know, I'm a scorch
mark on 9th Avenue...

03:52.224 --> 03:53.704
Well, let's not think about
that, OK?

03:55.294 --> 03:58.295
Look, we've...
we've been through so much.

03:58.330 --> 04:02.199
Lost... so much.

04:02.268 --> 04:05.335
But now... we have each other.

04:05.371 --> 04:08.171
And it's good.

04:08.207 --> 04:10.173
It's really, really good.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.209
Mmhmm.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.311
So... enjoy it.

04:14.346 --> 04:17.180
OK.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.182
I will. Starting right now.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.218
Thank you.

04:24.256 --> 04:25.289
Clary.

04:27.393 --> 04:29.226
Sorry. What are you doing here?

04:29.261 --> 04:31.228
Is... is everything OK?

04:31.263 --> 04:33.297
Inquisitor Herondale just
arrived at the Institute.

04:33.332 --> 04:36.133
She wants to speak with us. Now.

04:36.168 --> 04:37.643
Let me get my stuff.

04:40.205 --> 04:42.172
Jace, there's something
I wanted to tell you.

04:42.207 --> 04:45.175
No matter what,
your secret's safe with me.

04:45.210 --> 04:46.276
What secret?

04:47.212 --> 04:49.179
You know,
how your pure angelic blood

04:49.214 --> 04:51.181
somehow made me
immune to the sun.

04:51.216 --> 04:53.250
You don't know
that's what happened.

04:53.285 --> 04:55.152
What else could it be?

04:55.187 --> 04:57.220
My point is,
if any vampire were to find out,

04:57.256 --> 04:59.289
there'd be a bullseye
on your carotid artery.

04:59.325 --> 05:02.292
You have nothing to worry about.
I got your back.

05:02.328 --> 05:04.161
Get in here.

05:04.196 --> 05:05.228
Stop it.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.297
- I just...
- No.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.366
Never. Clary, you ready?

05:09.401 --> 05:11.368
Yeah.

05:11.403 --> 05:13.337
- I'll call you tonight?
- Yeah.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.836
I could keep going,

05:29.910 --> 05:33.364
or you could tell me where
you hid the Mortal Cup.

05:33.399 --> 05:36.367
Now where's the fun in
that, huh?

05:36.402 --> 05:39.197
You know,
this quest of yours to collect

05:39.257 --> 05:43.322
the three Mortal Instruments
to raise the angel Raziel...

05:43.357 --> 05:47.326
it was a fool's errand.

05:47.361 --> 05:49.295
A fool doesn't demand
this kind of attention,

05:49.330 --> 05:51.197
now would he?

05:52.433 --> 05:55.201
No one's ever seen
the Mortal Mirror.

05:55.236 --> 05:57.336
We have no idea
if it even exists.

05:57.371 --> 05:59.305
The Clave has no idea

05:59.340 --> 06:02.274
about a multitude of things.

06:02.310 --> 06:04.310
Well, this much is certain.

06:04.345 --> 06:06.412
At this point,
your only way to avoid execution

06:06.447 --> 06:08.380
is hand over the Cup.

06:10.451 --> 06:13.419
Actually, it's quite the opposite.
See, knowing

06:13.454 --> 06:16.288
where the Mortal Cup is...

06:16.324 --> 06:19.225
that's the only thing
that's keeping me alive.

06:19.260 --> 06:21.293
Valentine, you and I both know,

06:21.329 --> 06:23.429
the cup can control demons.

06:23.464 --> 06:26.432
In the wrong hands,
it could be catastrophic.

06:26.467 --> 06:28.434
In your hands,

06:28.469 --> 06:30.469
I'm a dead man.

06:30.505 --> 06:32.471
19 Shadowhunters died

06:32.507 --> 06:34.473
in your assault
on this institute,

06:34.509 --> 06:37.276
along with hundreds
of Downworlders

06:37.311 --> 06:40.312
that you massacred
with the Soul Sword.

06:40.348 --> 06:42.281
Justice will be served.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.223
Make it stop!

06:53.461 --> 06:55.427
Stop!

07:05.306 --> 07:07.239
How long can you
keep torturing him?

07:07.275 --> 07:09.241
As long as it takes.

07:09.277 --> 07:11.288
If you want the truth,
why not just use the soul sword?

07:11.312 --> 07:13.312
You're telling me
how to do my job?

07:13.347 --> 07:15.381
No, but you said you
retrieved the sword right

07:15.416 --> 07:18.417
after the attack. I just don't
understand why you wouldn't...

07:18.452 --> 07:20.419
The rune your sister
drew to deactivate

07:20.454 --> 07:23.322
the sword ended up
damaging it in the process.

07:23.357 --> 07:25.391
It's been sent to the Iron
Sisters to be purified.

07:25.426 --> 07:27.426
You're Valentine's children.

07:27.461 --> 07:30.262
Tell me what you know.

07:30.298 --> 07:32.364
Nothing.
Haven't we proven ourselves?

07:32.400 --> 07:35.301
Valentine attacked the Institute.
We captured him.

07:35.336 --> 07:37.303
At what cost? By taking matters

07:37.338 --> 07:40.172
into your own hands,
you've planted the seeds of rebellion

07:40.207 --> 07:42.207
in the Downworld.
The Accords will be

07:42.243 --> 07:44.176
near impossible to maintain now.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.347
Fall in line, or you'll end up

07:48.382 --> 07:51.216
like Aldertree and
Idris facing reprimand.

08:14.308 --> 08:16.241
Evening, gentlemen.

08:16.277 --> 08:18.177
I'll have a scotch.

08:18.212 --> 08:21.146
Neat.
And the Mortal Cup, please.

08:21.182 --> 08:23.115
What did you just say?

08:23.150 --> 08:24.150
Don't.

08:30.108 --> 08:32.375
I know you're part of
Herondale's security detail.

08:32.397 --> 08:34.442
I also know that you've
captured Valentine, which means

08:34.466 --> 08:37.200
you have the Cup,
or you know where it is.

08:38.303 --> 08:40.068
I'd like you to tell me.

08:40.105 --> 08:43.072
Nobody knows.
Valentine won't tell anyone.

08:45.010 --> 08:46.183
Pity.

08:49.447 --> 08:52.315
Hey, are you OK?

08:52.350 --> 08:55.583
What the Hell.
Let's make it a party.

09:05.196 --> 09:07.096
Mm.

09:15.510 --> 09:17.444
See you in Hell.

09:21.163 --> 09:23.130
Ladies.

09:41.764 --> 09:43.436
Izzy, tell me what to
do and I can do it.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.416
Whatever you need.

09:45.451 --> 09:46.751
I'm OK...

09:46.786 --> 09:49.620
I just need to sweat it out.

09:56.629 --> 09:59.497
Izzy. Izzy...

10:05.570 --> 10:08.471
Stop! It burns!

10:15.487 --> 10:18.254
No one knows, right?

10:18.290 --> 10:19.322
No.

10:20.258 --> 10:23.259
Nobody.
They all think you have the flu.

10:26.598 --> 10:28.598
What is it?

10:32.601 --> 10:33.566
There was a demon attack.

10:33.572 --> 10:36.423
They need me.

10:36.497 --> 10:37.596
Alec, you have to call...

10:37.631 --> 10:39.550
No. Izzy, I'm not going to

10:39.556 --> 10:40.556
leave you like this.

10:44.472 --> 10:46.371
Alec, go.

10:48.709 --> 10:51.577
I'm gonna be fine.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.481
I promise.

10:58.552 --> 11:01.487
Your sister...

11:01.522 --> 11:06.391
Your brother and my
friend are family.

11:06.427 --> 11:08.293
We can't replace them. But if we

11:08.329 --> 11:10.839
don't move forward
because of them...

11:11.713 --> 11:13.314
It's getting pretty
heated out there.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.901
They just need to
blow off some steam.

11:15.060 --> 11:17.361
They're losing faith in you, Luke.
They think

11:17.396 --> 11:19.408
you brought us into a battle
you knew we couldn't win.

11:19.432 --> 11:20.931
Is that what you think?

11:20.966 --> 11:23.267
No. They're scared,

11:23.302 --> 11:25.235
and so am I. I mean,

11:25.271 --> 11:27.271
Russell's out there talking
about hunting mundanes.

11:27.306 --> 11:29.084
Saying that's the only way
we can rebuild the pack.

11:29.108 --> 11:30.692
Turning innocent humans?

11:32.011 --> 11:35.012
As a family,
then we will fade out of existence!

11:35.047 --> 11:37.960
I mean, come on,
does anybody else have any better ideas?

11:38.008 --> 11:39.607
Hey! Nobody's turning anybody.

11:39.649 --> 11:41.949
Says the alpha who killed
three quarters of the pack.

11:41.984 --> 11:43.851
Luke didn't kill anybody,

11:43.886 --> 11:45.886
and we can't just go
around hunting mundanes.

11:45.915 --> 11:49.245
Why not? You think they'd
hesitate to attack us

11:49.313 --> 11:52.014
if the tables were turned? Huh?

11:52.020 --> 11:53.119
Alright. That's enough.

11:53.155 --> 11:55.088
That's right.
It is enough, Luke...

11:55.116 --> 11:58.028
because I challenge you.
Right here, right now.

11:58.062 --> 11:59.268
Russell, you need to relax.

11:59.274 --> 12:02.511
He is not fit to be our alpha.
Not anymore.

12:04.034 --> 12:05.901
Come on, let's go!

12:06.977 --> 12:09.777
We've all had a rough time,

12:10.126 --> 12:12.159
so I'm giving you a
chance to reconsider,

12:13.367 --> 12:15.506
because I've seen way
too many wolves die

12:15.573 --> 12:17.573
to stomach seeing another.

12:23.447 --> 12:24.780
Detective Garroway.

12:30.755 --> 12:32.083
Yeah.

12:32.183 --> 12:34.556
Secure the crime scene.
I'll be right there.

12:40.665 --> 12:42.598
What's this sand on the floor?

12:42.633 --> 12:44.055
This looks like a demon attack.

12:44.061 --> 12:46.261
I've never seen a demon cause
this kind of hemorrhaging.

12:46.404 --> 12:48.370
Is there any security footage?

12:48.406 --> 12:49.805
Nothing in the bar. Maybe.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.177
CCTV caught something
outside on the street.

12:57.155 --> 12:58.568
We should get them
back to the Institute.

12:58.589 --> 13:00.422
Yeah, that's a good idea.

13:00.458 --> 13:02.558
Detective Garroway?

13:02.593 --> 13:04.393
Who are you talking to?

13:04.428 --> 13:07.019
Just dictating some notes
while they're still fresh.

13:07.072 --> 13:08.308
Something you
should start doing.

13:08.332 --> 13:10.377
That's a great idea!
They didn't mention it in training,

13:10.401 --> 13:11.734
but it makes perfect sense.

13:11.769 --> 13:14.303
Is there some
special app for that?

13:14.338 --> 13:16.672
Uh... can you pull the car up?

13:16.707 --> 13:19.511
- I'll meet you out front.
- OK.

13:25.110 --> 13:27.076
New partner?

13:27.082 --> 13:29.148
She's driving me crazy.

13:43.776 --> 13:45.709
Raphael.

13:48.722 --> 13:49.726
Isabelle...

13:52.631 --> 13:54.564
What are you doing here?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.434
Uh... I w...
I wanted to apologize.

13:57.469 --> 14:01.438
It was a terrible night and
I took my anger out on you.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.407
You were only trying
to save your people.

14:06.016 --> 14:08.015
It's not safe for a Shadowhunter

14:08.021 --> 14:09.951
to be at the DuMort right now.

14:10.236 --> 14:12.136
Especially one looking
for vampire venom.

14:12.171 --> 14:14.171
Raphael, I think...
if I can have

14:14.207 --> 14:17.226
a small bite,
over time I can have less and less.

14:17.266 --> 14:18.175
It doesn't work like that.

14:18.211 --> 14:20.111
Why not?

14:20.146 --> 14:21.979
Well... we can manage it...

14:22.015 --> 14:25.983
together.

14:29.754 --> 14:32.020
You really should go.

14:35.126 --> 14:37.893
Wait. OK.

14:37.928 --> 14:39.100
What...
what do you want from me?

14:39.119 --> 14:41.004
I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll...
I'll give you anything you wa...

14:41.021 --> 14:43.088
I want you... to leave.

14:43.123 --> 14:45.436
I'm just asking
for a little taste.

14:50.589 --> 14:51.589
You know you want it.

14:54.782 --> 14:57.016
I'm not doing this, Isabelle.

14:59.462 --> 15:01.362
Seriously?
This is how you treat me

15:01.398 --> 15:02.871
when I need you the most?
I thought you

15:02.877 --> 15:04.343
cared about me Raphael
but I guess I was wrong.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.905
It's because I care.

15:08.779 --> 15:10.936
I should have never
given you a taste.

15:13.684 --> 15:15.751
Oh, Isabelle.

15:28.786 --> 15:30.232
Just got off the
phone with Luke.

15:30.253 --> 15:32.187
He made it look like
a tragic gas leak.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.550
According to the
autopsy, the victims

15:33.556 --> 15:35.128
died of massive
brain hemorrhaging.

15:35.158 --> 15:37.192
- A demon can do that?
- A Greater Demon can.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.160
Wh...
what exactly is the difference?

15:39.196 --> 15:41.096
Lesser Demons are a dime a dozen

15:41.131 --> 15:43.998
in New York. Greater Demons
are a whole different story.

15:44.034 --> 15:46.000
They have names, personalities.

15:46.036 --> 15:48.970
They're much more powerful
and they're harder to stop.

15:49.005 --> 15:51.327
They're also incredibly rare.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.374
When they do show their
face, there's a reason.

15:55.825 --> 15:57.858
Jace, are you OK?

15:57.906 --> 15:59.700
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

15:59.706 --> 16:00.763
Well, you've barely spoken about

16:00.782 --> 16:02.980
what happened with
the Soul Sword.

16:03.106 --> 16:04.405
Yeah, well,

16:04.478 --> 16:06.378
there's not much to talk about.

16:06.413 --> 16:09.314
OK, but if you do
feel like talking,

16:09.349 --> 16:12.355
I'm here for you.
I'm your sister, Jace.

16:12.423 --> 16:14.957
I know what you're
going through.

16:14.999 --> 16:17.299
Like I said,
there's nothing to talk about.

16:36.327 --> 16:37.693
Open up!

16:40.391 --> 16:42.424
I know there are vampires here!

16:49.154 --> 16:52.221
Open up! Please.

17:02.388 --> 17:04.955
I can smell your
weakness a realm away.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.357
What do you want from me?

17:06.392 --> 17:08.851
The Mortal Cup, please.

17:26.944 --> 17:28.912
Hey! Let the girl go!

17:29.681 --> 17:30.681
Hey!

17:57.261 --> 17:58.928
You OK?

18:01.041 --> 18:02.006
Who are you?

18:02.042 --> 18:03.042
I'm a Shadowhunter.

18:04.978 --> 18:06.878
My name's Sebastian.

18:11.327 --> 18:15.429
You're not showing up?
Come on, Maureen, I said I was sorry.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.541
Yeah, I... I know I should have called.
I know I should have called.

18:18.571 --> 18:20.366
Just... look, it's been a
really hard time for me lately.

18:20.390 --> 18:23.177
OK, whoa! Whoa, that was blunt.

18:23.217 --> 18:25.387
Uh, can I at least
keep the band name?

18:25.441 --> 18:28.509
Rock Solid Panda? Hello?
Maureen? Hello?

18:28.544 --> 18:32.446
I didn't think I'd see you here.

18:32.481 --> 18:34.448
Yeah. I was um...
meeting someone,

18:34.483 --> 18:36.383
but I should... I should go.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.319
Whoa, hey!

18:38.354 --> 18:40.321
Daylight! I mean, I know.

18:40.356 --> 18:44.091
You're upset at me for attacking
Clary, but barbecuing

18:44.145 --> 18:46.446
yourself to avoid me
seems like a bit much.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.434
Come on,
I don't hate you that much.

18:48.492 --> 18:51.326
Just... don't try that again.

18:51.361 --> 18:53.394
How did you get in here anyway?

18:53.430 --> 18:55.263
I drove.

18:55.298 --> 18:57.365
Outside? In the sun?

18:59.355 --> 19:02.375
How?
What did Valentine do to you?

19:03.582 --> 19:05.675
OK,
so he slashed my throat open,

19:05.735 --> 19:07.013
like completely.
And then he used

19:07.037 --> 19:09.604
this nuclearized
sword, like swiped it,

19:09.639 --> 19:11.606
and next thing I know...

19:14.878 --> 19:17.011
the sun doesn't fry me anymore.

19:17.047 --> 19:19.747
That's it? Just like that?

19:20.067 --> 19:21.099
Yeah. Crazy, right?

19:21.126 --> 19:24.070
Simon, that's amazing!

19:24.626 --> 19:27.037
Don't you realize you have
what every Downworlder wants?

19:27.043 --> 19:28.650
A winning personality!
You noticed!

19:28.665 --> 19:31.465
The chance at living
a normal life.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.551
Simon, you hit the jackpot!

19:33.402 --> 19:35.302
I never hit the jackpot!

19:37.706 --> 19:41.541
Um, I would... be careful.

19:41.577 --> 19:43.510
But like,
isn't the whole point of this now

19:43.545 --> 19:45.445
that I don't have to
be careful anymore?

19:45.481 --> 19:46.546
I mean,

19:46.582 --> 19:47.582
yeah. Sure,

19:47.616 --> 19:49.616
but you don't need to
flaunt it in people's faces.

19:49.651 --> 19:51.485
No-one likes a show off.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.287
Especially Downworlders.

19:54.323 --> 19:58.539
If I were you,
I would try and keep a low profile.

19:59.762 --> 20:01.661
To the new you. Gratis.

20:01.697 --> 20:04.598
May I fly forever
under the radar.

20:10.283 --> 20:12.216
♪ 'Cause we are meant to be ♪

20:15.458 --> 20:16.390
Hey!

20:16.426 --> 20:17.469
You must be reading my mind.

20:17.493 --> 20:19.072
I was just about to call you.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.363
There's a Greater
Demon on the loose.

20:21.417 --> 20:24.785
And we need your help.
It's been leaving this on its victims.

20:27.790 --> 20:30.824
Oh, dear.
This sand, it's from Duduael.

20:32.122 --> 20:34.956
Which is a... dimension of Hell?

20:34.962 --> 20:37.763
The worst dimension.
Did you find this on their face?

20:37.805 --> 20:40.873
- Mmhmm.
- How did he get loose?

20:40.942 --> 20:43.109
He's been shackled
for centuries.

20:43.144 --> 20:45.111
- Who, Magnus?
- The demon

20:45.146 --> 20:47.079
who taught man the
weapons of war.

20:47.135 --> 20:51.239
A Greater Demon, Azazel,
one of the princes of Hell.

20:51.273 --> 20:53.579
Right. A real prince.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.486
Why is it so dark in here?

20:59.605 --> 21:02.339
Hello, Alec.

21:02.385 --> 21:03.679
What is he doing here?

21:03.713 --> 21:05.646
Raphael has something
important to tell you.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.981
Nothing he says matters to me.

21:08.582 --> 21:10.742
Your sister's in trouble.

21:10.869 --> 21:11.885
You're damn right she is.

21:11.921 --> 21:14.455
She's suffering withdrawal back
at the Institute because of you!

21:14.490 --> 21:17.758
She just came by the
DuMort, begging for a bite.

21:19.959 --> 21:20.959
What?

21:21.769 --> 21:24.536
I didn't touch her.
You have my word.

21:24.572 --> 21:26.643
But there are plenty of vampires
more than eager to take a bite.

21:26.667 --> 21:29.401
I never should have
left her alone.

21:29.443 --> 21:30.443
It's not your fault.

21:30.478 --> 21:32.377
Don't worry. We'll find her.

21:32.413 --> 21:35.414
Here's the address
to the closest den.

21:35.449 --> 21:37.649
There's a good
chance she's there.

21:40.354 --> 21:41.787
Let's go.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.386
Azazel did this.

22:12.095 --> 22:14.013
Izzy's necklace.

22:14.019 --> 22:15.118
It's broken.

22:16.032 --> 22:18.120
Where is she?

22:18.234 --> 22:20.238
I thought Izzy had the flu!
Why would she leave the institute?

22:20.262 --> 22:23.134
I don't know,
but if he's hurt her...

22:23.195 --> 22:26.096
She could have escaped.
We don't even know if he has her.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.540
She hasn't called,
and she's not answering

22:27.564 --> 22:30.106
her phone.
But she's still alive.

22:30.141 --> 22:32.475
I know it, it's just...

22:32.510 --> 22:33.510
He's got her.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.545
What does he want?

22:36.581 --> 22:39.192
I don't know, but we should
inform the Inquisitor, OK?

22:39.272 --> 22:41.973
But she's in a meeting
with the Alicante Council.

22:42.823 --> 22:43.823
I don't understand.

22:43.997 --> 22:45.196
Why Izzy?

22:45.251 --> 22:46.851
What does a Greater
Demon want with her?

22:47.413 --> 22:49.380
I'm not sure...

22:49.415 --> 22:51.349
I think I know who we could ask.

22:55.421 --> 22:58.189
I have no idea what
you're talking about...

22:58.224 --> 23:00.914
but it's so nice to
see the both of you.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.847
Azazel wouldn't leave
Duduael on his own.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.815
Someone broke him out.

23:04.844 --> 23:07.049
Someone with access
to the Mortal Cup.

23:07.156 --> 23:09.089
Circle Members. They released

23:09.125 --> 23:11.058
the Greater Demon to
break you out of here.

23:11.093 --> 23:12.504
I thought I raised you
to have common sense.

23:12.528 --> 23:14.473
If the Greater Demon wanted to free
me, how would I

23:14.497 --> 23:18.418
still be here having this inane
conversation with you two?

23:18.424 --> 23:20.857
I want to banish demon
filth from our realm.

23:20.910 --> 23:23.116
If that's true,
then tell your followers to give back

23:23.217 --> 23:25.250
the cup. We can force
Azazel to give us Izzy.

23:25.285 --> 23:27.152
I don't know where
the Mortal Cup is.

23:27.187 --> 23:30.135
If you're lying,
so help the Angel.

23:30.141 --> 23:32.975
If you were smart, Jace,
you'd use me as bait.

23:34.094 --> 23:38.595
The only way to control a Greater
Demon is with the Mortal Cup.

23:38.601 --> 23:41.135
Azazel would do
anything to destroy it.

23:41.164 --> 23:43.164
So summon him with
your warlock friend

23:43.199 --> 23:44.480
and tell him I have the Cup.

23:44.567 --> 23:47.480
Offer him a trade.
Me for Isabelle.

23:49.171 --> 23:50.171
That could work.

23:50.507 --> 23:52.306
Once we have Izzy,
I can take him out

23:52.342 --> 23:53.342
with my sunlight rune.

23:53.376 --> 23:55.276
This is a trap.
What could possibly

23:55.311 --> 23:57.311
make you think that
we could trust him?

23:57.347 --> 23:59.325
I'm not sure I would trust
me either if I were you, but

23:59.349 --> 24:01.149
the longer Azazel has Isabelle,

24:01.184 --> 24:03.117
the greater the chance she dies.

24:03.153 --> 24:04.313
We don't have a choice, Jace.

24:05.388 --> 24:09.636
This better not be a trap.
Your life is on the line too.

24:09.730 --> 24:10.558
Clarissa...

24:10.593 --> 24:16.277
I would never do anything to hurt you.
You're my daughter.

24:16.351 --> 24:17.858
Why would that stop you?

24:17.892 --> 24:19.858
Jace is your son,
you've hurt him plenty.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.230
You didn't tell her.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.065
Tell me what?

24:31.382 --> 24:33.649
You must still have
feelings for her, huh?

24:33.823 --> 24:35.790
And now isn't that a pickle?

24:35.833 --> 24:37.191
Not another word.

24:37.208 --> 24:38.208
What is he talking about?

24:38.242 --> 24:40.108
You wanna do the
honours or shall I?

24:40.671 --> 24:42.638
I said shut up!

24:47.612 --> 24:49.578
It's rude to keep a girl
waiting, Jace.

24:49.614 --> 24:51.413
Jace, what is going on?

24:59.134 --> 25:00.500
Valentine's not my father.

25:05.663 --> 25:07.696
I'm not your brother, Clary.

25:29.547 --> 25:30.837
- Clary.
- How long have you known?

25:30.861 --> 25:32.493
- Just a few days.
- Why didn't you

25:32.514 --> 25:33.480
say something?

25:33.515 --> 25:34.448
You have a good thing

25:34.483 --> 25:36.416
going on with Simon.
You're happy.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.251
I wouldn't wanna ruin that.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.220
Why would that ruin anything?

25:42.224 --> 25:43.568
Jace, what else are
you hiding from me?

25:43.592 --> 25:45.158
Nothing.

25:46.195 --> 25:47.561
I swear.

25:50.403 --> 25:52.403
Look, we need to be able
to trust each other.

25:52.417 --> 25:55.318
And that means being
completely honest,

25:55.367 --> 25:57.234
even if the truth hurts.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.674
I get it.

26:00.709 --> 26:02.696
Emotions serve a purpose.

26:02.732 --> 26:05.466
You don't go through what
you just went through,

26:05.472 --> 26:08.043
witnessing all that death
and not feel something, Jace!

26:08.050 --> 26:09.983
It's not good for you!

26:10.019 --> 26:12.386
Just feel something.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.357
Whether you think it clouds
your judgment or not.

26:32.041 --> 26:34.274
You know,
jonesing for venom isn't exactly

26:34.283 --> 26:36.227
conducive to success
when battling demons.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.862
- How did you know?
- The darting eyes.

26:38.898 --> 26:41.418
The Grey complexion. That bloody
wrist tremor, that's the worst.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.202
I've never seen you
at the Institute.

26:45.238 --> 26:47.204
That's 'cause I'm
not from around here.

26:47.240 --> 26:50.040
I'm from the London Institute.

26:50.521 --> 26:51.521
Here.

26:55.218 --> 26:58.052
One drop and you'll
feel like a new person.

26:58.066 --> 27:00.032
What is it?

27:00.068 --> 27:01.968
It's medicine.

27:03.138 --> 27:05.371
See. It's from an extract

27:05.407 --> 27:08.307
of a root found in L'Isle Adam.

27:08.343 --> 27:10.343
It's a quaint little town.

27:11.981 --> 27:14.313
Look, it'll help with the
pain of your venom addiction.

27:14.349 --> 27:16.282
Speed up your recovery.

27:19.053 --> 27:20.053
Come on.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.397
Mmhmm.

27:34.189 --> 27:36.089
Yeah, it's not a miracle drug.

27:36.138 --> 27:37.257
It'll wear off soon
and you'll feel

27:37.263 --> 27:39.287
like crap again,
but it does help.

27:42.110 --> 27:44.043
So, why aren't you in London

27:44.078 --> 27:46.012
with... your Institute?

27:46.047 --> 27:49.738
I had to kick my
Yin Fen addiction,

27:49.812 --> 27:51.590
and let's just say that
London wasn't the best place

27:51.614 --> 27:55.483
to do that. So, I um...

27:55.824 --> 27:57.224
I took matters
into my own hands.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.192
I left.

27:59.228 --> 28:01.194
And I found my way to New York.

28:01.230 --> 28:03.263
You went AWOL?

28:03.299 --> 28:05.198
- I.
- Like to think of it more

28:05.234 --> 28:07.167
like a walk about, but um...

28:07.202 --> 28:10.636
the good news is,
I was successful.

28:13.455 --> 28:14.487
You can be, too.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.879
Thank you so much.

28:18.914 --> 28:21.804
I should probably get going.

28:21.924 --> 28:23.857
You walk out that door
and within an hour

28:23.899 --> 28:26.133
you'll be back in a vampire
den, begging for a bite.

28:29.105 --> 28:32.039
You need at least a
day to get enough venom

28:32.074 --> 28:34.108
out of your system to be
able to handle yourself.

28:34.856 --> 28:37.690
If you want to leave,
I won't stop you.

28:44.271 --> 28:47.338
Well, I'll swing by the
pho place on my way home.

28:47.394 --> 28:49.627
I know, I know. Not too spicy.

28:49.663 --> 28:54.666
Will you stop? Stop!
I'm at work. Bye. Sorry.

28:54.673 --> 28:57.850
My girlfriend Samantha.
She was supposed to grab dinner, but...

28:58.044 --> 29:00.471
She... pho-got?

29:00.540 --> 29:03.441
Oh my God. A joke.

29:05.445 --> 29:07.345
So you are human after all.

29:07.380 --> 29:09.775
Well, what about you?
You have someone?

29:10.107 --> 29:14.494
Wife? Girlfriend? Boyfriend?

29:14.661 --> 29:17.326
First rule of being my
partner: no personal questions.

29:17.383 --> 29:19.222
You say that now,
but I don't think it's normal to sit

29:19.246 --> 29:21.179
in a car with someone all day and not chat.
I mean, if we're

29:21.201 --> 29:23.281
gonna be partners,
we have to get to know each other.

29:26.272 --> 29:28.117
- We need to talk.
- Is that your girlfriend?

29:28.174 --> 29:30.107
Cute. Young.

29:30.143 --> 29:33.110
Hi! I'm Ollie.
Luke's pretty private

29:33.138 --> 29:35.510
about his personal life,
but I'm glad he has one.

29:35.593 --> 29:37.226
She's not my girlfriend.

29:39.152 --> 29:42.077
Russell's gone.
He took all his stuff.

29:42.163 --> 29:43.763
Good riddance.
He was bad for the pack.

29:43.798 --> 29:46.098
He also took Reid,
Greg, and Segan.

29:46.134 --> 29:48.167
They don't trust you.
They're headed down to Philly

29:48.202 --> 29:51.904
to start their own pack.
They asked me to go with them.

29:55.455 --> 29:57.702
Look, if you wanna
leave, by all means.

29:57.815 --> 30:00.616
I'm not going anywhere, Luke.
But there's only a few

30:00.651 --> 30:02.651
of us left.
How's the pack going to survive?

30:02.687 --> 30:04.348
Look, I don't care if
it's just you and me,

30:04.372 --> 30:06.589
we'll figure out a way.

30:06.624 --> 30:08.057
But I won't let it come to that.

30:08.092 --> 30:10.795
I've been out recruiting other
members from other packs.

30:10.928 --> 30:12.727
Trust me.

30:12.897 --> 30:14.830
Plenty of wolves want
to eat at the Jade Wolf.

30:17.034 --> 30:19.556
No, they don't.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.540
Yeah, right.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.981
There you are.

30:35.411 --> 30:37.945
Magnus is downstairs and the
Inquisitor's Council meeting

30:37.989 --> 30:39.819
will be over in an hour.

30:39.873 --> 30:41.257
We don't have much time.

30:43.428 --> 30:45.328
Jace, you OK?

31:19.928 --> 31:23.498
Mm! Oh my God, I haven't eaten
in days and this is amazing.

31:23.561 --> 31:26.334
I ate at this café in
Paris, once.

31:26.405 --> 31:28.471
And I watched this chef
make his Bouillabaisse.

31:28.507 --> 31:31.408
And so the next time I wanted
soup, I copied him.

31:31.443 --> 31:33.243
What do you mean,
you copied him?

31:33.278 --> 31:35.178
I memorized everything he did.

31:35.214 --> 31:38.148
And then I did it
myself and voilà!

31:41.553 --> 31:43.520
Yeah.

31:43.555 --> 31:45.488
Sometimes just...

31:45.524 --> 31:48.218
knowing that someone else can
do something remarkable makes it

31:48.224 --> 31:50.124
possible for you to do it too.

31:53.498 --> 31:56.266
You need to call your Institute.

31:56.301 --> 31:58.301
Let them know you're OK.

31:58.337 --> 32:02.530
I know, but...

32:02.640 --> 32:05.141
I've just let so
many people down,

32:05.176 --> 32:07.610
especially my brother,

32:07.645 --> 32:09.590
that I don't know if he's
gonna be able to forgive me.

32:09.614 --> 32:13.416
Look, it might take some
time, but my guess is he will.

32:13.451 --> 32:16.385
You don't know Alec. He's...
he's just like my mom.

32:16.421 --> 32:18.521
Stubborn and strong-willed.

32:18.556 --> 32:21.390
Yeah, I know all about stubborn

32:21.426 --> 32:23.392
strong-willed mothers.

32:23.428 --> 32:24.493
- Yeah?
- Mmhmm.

32:24.529 --> 32:26.462
Is she in London?

32:26.497 --> 32:28.197
No.

32:28.499 --> 32:30.399
No, she, uh...

32:30.435 --> 32:32.962
Well, she's gone now, so.

32:33.671 --> 32:35.204
Oh. I'm sorry.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.552
Oh, don't be. She was miserable.

32:38.933 --> 32:40.833
Yeah.

32:41.180 --> 32:42.378
In the end, I forgave her, but,

32:42.402 --> 32:44.302
she loved me.

32:44.759 --> 32:46.726
She just had a...

32:46.822 --> 32:48.789
strange way of showing it.

32:55.665 --> 32:57.565
Look,
don't let your brother worry.

33:09.965 --> 33:12.298
Hey, Clary, it's me.
Are we still on for tonight?

33:12.362 --> 33:14.373
'Cause I can't wait to tell you
about the day I had. Headlines...

33:14.397 --> 33:17.298
I'm going back to NYU, majoring in...
wait for it...

33:17.333 --> 33:19.233
Music!

33:19.833 --> 33:21.866
Minoring in accounting for mom.
Everyone's happy.

33:21.901 --> 33:23.735
Call me back. Bye.

33:31.711 --> 33:33.711
Oh, G...!

33:34.437 --> 33:36.370
You ever tried not
sneaking up on people?

33:36.405 --> 33:38.639
I'm sorry,
I didn't want to interrupt.

33:38.674 --> 33:41.208
You said you were having a...
day?

33:41.277 --> 33:44.458
Yeah, you know... inside.

33:44.598 --> 33:46.146
Really?

33:46.182 --> 33:47.626
Because I heard a funny
rumor that you were

33:47.650 --> 33:49.550
at the Hunter's
Moon this afternoon.

33:49.585 --> 33:51.452
What?

33:51.487 --> 33:54.455
Pfft. That's weird.
Who told you that?

33:54.490 --> 33:55.500
Why are people talking about me?

33:55.524 --> 33:56.357
Why are you panicking?

33:56.392 --> 33:57.392
I'm not panicking.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.393
It's true, isn't it?

33:59.428 --> 34:02.296
You're a daylighter?

34:02.331 --> 34:05.265
There's a name for it?

34:05.301 --> 34:07.601
Yeah, in the legends.

34:08.300 --> 34:10.234
I just never believed
that they could be real.

34:12.527 --> 34:14.591
OK. Yes, I can walk in the sun,

34:14.616 --> 34:16.114
but you don't need
to advertise that.

34:16.135 --> 34:17.467
Not everyone needs to know.

34:17.496 --> 34:18.496
How'd it happen?

34:19.406 --> 34:21.373
Not sure, really. You know,

34:21.408 --> 34:22.418
there's a lot of
carcinogens in here

34:22.442 --> 34:24.342
that I could have been exposed
to, bugs...

34:24.378 --> 34:27.212
Simon, I've been a
vampire for 60 years.

34:27.246 --> 34:30.248
You've been one for
what, two weeks?

34:30.284 --> 34:34.119
This isn't the sort of information
you should be hoarding for yourself.

34:34.154 --> 34:36.221
Well, I swear Raphael.

34:36.255 --> 34:38.219
Told you everything I know.

34:39.206 --> 34:40.206
Yeah.

34:41.495 --> 34:43.428
I hope so.

34:51.552 --> 34:52.518
Is the courtyard glamoured?

34:52.553 --> 34:53.811
No one can see us.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.454
I don't know.

34:55.489 --> 34:56.589
Still seems like a risk.

34:56.623 --> 34:58.147
We have no choice.

34:58.186 --> 34:59.986
This is the only
space big enough.

35:00.461 --> 35:02.361
Security cameras in
the cell are down.

35:02.397 --> 35:05.156
We've got a half hour until the
Inquisitor's done with her meeting.

35:08.436 --> 35:10.169
Is Clary ready?

35:11.205 --> 35:12.205
Let's do this.

35:18.546 --> 35:21.013
I call upon the power
of the Pentagram.

35:21.215 --> 35:23.528
Azazel, I summon thee.

35:24.452 --> 35:27.642
From within our realm,
into this mystical confinement,

35:27.705 --> 35:28.421
I summon thee.

35:28.456 --> 35:32.583
You seek the Mortal Cup.
We seek the return of our friend.

35:32.677 --> 35:33.742
For this exchange,

35:34.513 --> 35:35.513
I summon thee.

35:47.292 --> 35:48.292
Well...

35:48.686 --> 35:50.619
if it isn't Magnus Bane.

35:52.015 --> 35:53.048
Brave move.

35:54.533 --> 35:56.466
Return Isabelle Lightwood...

35:56.502 --> 35:59.278
and we'll hand over Valentine.

35:59.388 --> 36:01.322
He can lead you
to the Mortal Cup.

36:04.819 --> 36:06.852
Valentine Morgenstern.

36:06.888 --> 36:08.754
The man who dares to dream big.

36:10.024 --> 36:14.778
It is a tempting offer,
but I don't have your friend Isabelle.

36:14.865 --> 36:15.831
He's lying.

36:15.866 --> 36:17.866
I'm not so sure.

36:17.901 --> 36:20.736
There's no time for debate.
The barrier's weakening.

36:24.108 --> 36:26.675
We can still find Isabelle,
but we can't let Azazel get away.

36:27.077 --> 36:28.077
Clary, now!

36:33.727 --> 36:35.527
It's...

36:35.566 --> 36:36.599
It's not working!

36:36.634 --> 36:37.533
What are you talking about?

36:37.568 --> 36:38.568
Nothing's happening!

36:41.472 --> 36:42.832
You thought you
could contain me?!

36:53.317 --> 36:54.350
Jace!

36:54.385 --> 36:57.319
Ahh! Magnus! Stop him! Stop him.

37:05.097 --> 37:06.996
Stupid warlock.

37:16.325 --> 37:19.259
Now a present for you,
my dear Valentine.

37:23.332 --> 37:25.265
Jace!

38:02.881 --> 38:04.647
How did you do that?

38:07.119 --> 38:08.718
I have no idea.

38:11.156 --> 38:12.722
Doesn't matter. He got away.

38:19.938 --> 38:22.699
Hey, are you OK?

38:23.954 --> 38:25.754
Are you alright?

38:25.789 --> 38:27.201
I... I think so.

38:27.481 --> 38:28.513
OK.

38:45.643 --> 38:47.876
Help me. Help me!

38:51.548 --> 38:52.481
I'm fine.

38:52.516 --> 38:53.849
Just a little tired.

38:54.063 --> 38:57.205
Nothing a good night's
sleep won't fix.

38:57.821 --> 38:59.439
I can come back home with
you, if you'd like...

38:59.463 --> 39:00.463
No!

39:00.858 --> 39:01.790
No.

39:01.825 --> 39:03.725
It's OK.

39:03.761 --> 39:07.346
I'll... call you tomorrow.

39:14.185 --> 39:14.723
Izzy!

39:14.839 --> 39:16.333
I'm OK.

39:16.528 --> 39:17.594
Look...

39:17.739 --> 39:19.572
I know I shouldn't
have snuck out.

39:19.608 --> 39:22.942
It doesn't matter, you're...
You're alive.

39:22.978 --> 39:24.212
Of course I'm alive.

39:24.306 --> 39:25.979
No, there was a...
a greater demon attack.

39:26.014 --> 39:27.514
- And I just...
- I'm so sorry.

39:27.549 --> 39:29.883
I should have called you, but...

39:29.918 --> 39:31.851
I figured you'd be so angry with
me, and...

39:31.887 --> 39:33.787
Izzy, I'm not angry. I just...

39:33.822 --> 39:36.425
I want you back home. Safe.

39:36.431 --> 39:38.758
I'm safe. I promise.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.695
And, um... in a good place.

39:41.730 --> 39:44.812
I'm getting better
but I can't come home.

39:44.961 --> 39:46.433
Not now.

39:46.487 --> 39:50.113
If... it was something I said,
I just want you to know, just...

39:50.270 --> 39:51.336
No. No,

39:51.372 --> 39:53.205
it's not you.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.957
You've been great.

39:55.137 --> 39:57.309
This is just a battle I
need to fight on my own.

40:02.570 --> 40:03.836
I love you, Alec.

40:06.186 --> 40:07.275
I love you, too.

40:07.494 --> 40:08.494
I'll be home soon.

40:08.534 --> 40:09.534
Bye.

40:18.923 --> 40:19.989
Uh...

40:22.788 --> 40:24.588
I think the tea's ready.

40:24.649 --> 40:25.649
Yeah, it is.

40:28.720 --> 40:29.752
Do you want milk?

40:29.788 --> 40:30.788
Honey?

40:32.757 --> 40:33.690
You headed out?

40:33.725 --> 40:35.525
Yeah, to Simon's.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.185
I, uh...
gotta get out of here for a while.

40:37.208 --> 40:38.928
OK. I'll catch you later.

40:38.963 --> 40:39.963
Yeah.

40:42.534 --> 40:43.534
Jace.

40:44.502 --> 40:45.835
Wait.

40:47.906 --> 40:49.839
I'm...
I'm sorry I blew up at you.

40:50.967 --> 40:53.468
After everything you've been
through, that wasn't fair.

40:54.511 --> 40:57.846
No, I, uh...
I actually think you were right.

40:58.783 --> 40:59.882
I should've told you.

41:04.723 --> 41:07.395
This whole brother-sister
thing, I...

41:07.698 --> 41:09.698
finally thought I
knew where we stood.

41:10.768 --> 41:12.735
Yeah.

41:14.151 --> 41:18.253
I... I don't know. I...
I guess I just need time to process.

41:18.288 --> 41:20.221
Join the club.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.192
How you holding up?

41:24.227 --> 41:27.228
Other than feeling
like a total failure...

41:27.560 --> 41:29.460
great.

41:31.270 --> 41:32.270
How did you do it?

41:33.136 --> 41:36.392
You activated a rune
without your stelae.

41:36.791 --> 41:37.791
I don't know.

41:39.605 --> 41:41.605
Saw you lying there.

41:42.514 --> 41:44.347
And it just kind of...

41:45.275 --> 41:47.175
ignited. On its own.

41:48.458 --> 41:49.523
None of this makes sense.

41:49.559 --> 41:51.559
But we'll figure it out.

41:51.594 --> 41:53.461
The two of us.

42:13.349 --> 42:15.349
Disgusting warlock.

42:17.590 --> 42:21.657
