Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:01.884 --> 02:03.817
F-fuck.

06:21.621 --> 06:22.956
Hello.

06:25.758 --> 06:27.428
Just come on in.

06:30.696 --> 06:32.597
Ottoman is an odd choice.

06:32.599 --> 06:35.400
It's hard to break an ottoman.

06:35.402 --> 06:37.702
Tell that to Dick Van Dyke.

06:37.704 --> 06:40.139
I don't know what that means.

06:40.141 --> 06:42.373
I saw you at the park.

06:42.375 --> 06:43.978
So you're following me?

06:45.312 --> 06:46.611
In a way.

06:46.613 --> 06:49.481
Why? Who are you?

06:49.483 --> 06:51.282
Before you get comfortable,
let's skip to the part

06:51.284 --> 06:53.185
where you tell me what
you're doing in my house.

06:53.187 --> 06:55.253
- Apartment.
- Uh, sure.

06:55.255 --> 06:56.421
Had you said home,
I wouldn't have

06:56.423 --> 06:57.789
felt the need to correct you.

06:57.791 --> 07:01.261
Yeah, enough already.
Who put you up to this?

07:01.263 --> 07:03.263
You and I have business
to be discussed.

07:03.265 --> 07:05.398
- Business?
- A transaction.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.833
I didn't make
any purchases today.

07:06.835 --> 07:09.105
Your actions at the park.

07:11.405 --> 07:13.840
It's a public space.

07:13.842 --> 07:17.143
- You see, I keep to myself.
- As to why?

07:17.145 --> 07:19.679
Then you understand
why I'm here.

07:19.681 --> 07:21.381
The photograph?

07:21.383 --> 07:22.616
- Yeah.
- No sale.

07:22.618 --> 07:25.386
- I'm sorry.
- Hand it over.

07:25.388 --> 07:27.387
No, the photograph
is my property.

07:27.389 --> 07:30.223
It's staying with me
no matter what.

07:30.225 --> 07:32.392
It's, it's an aggressive stance
to take with a stranger

07:32.394 --> 07:33.427
no less a guest.

07:33.429 --> 07:34.629
It's my profession

07:34.631 --> 07:36.264
how I make my living.

07:36.266 --> 07:38.499
No one profits from me
unless I intend it.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.834
You're not the subject
of the frame.

07:39.836 --> 07:42.172
I don't need to ask
for your permission.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.439
And you seemed like
the reasonable type.

07:45.441 --> 07:46.541
You can leave now.

07:46.543 --> 07:47.808
Once I have the negative film

07:47.810 --> 07:49.477
and any prints you made
in my hand.

07:49.479 --> 07:51.246
I'm gonna ask you to leave now!

07:51.248 --> 07:52.813
You already have
and it won't work again.

07:52.815 --> 07:54.282
I'll call the police.

07:54.284 --> 07:55.484
With your rotary phone,
your finger

07:55.486 --> 07:57.785
wouldn't even spin nine.

07:57.787 --> 07:59.354
Well, now who's
bein' aggressive?

07:59.356 --> 08:01.422
- Where is it?
- Uh, no, forget it.

08:01.424 --> 08:03.457
It's a great photo.
I'm keeping it. You...

08:05.695 --> 08:08.931
You have 19 seconds before the
spasm you feel in your windpipe

08:08.933 --> 08:11.200
'causes your throat to close.

08:11.202 --> 08:13.569
The oxygen depravation
will lead to paralysis

08:13.571 --> 08:16.605
similar to a stroke.
Fourteen seconds.

08:16.607 --> 08:19.143
Tell me where it is
and I will make it stop.

08:21.479 --> 08:23.215
Bathroom.

08:25.816 --> 08:27.516
Deep breaths.

08:27.518 --> 08:29.987
Count to five between each one.

09:34.688 --> 09:36.722
Not the subject of the frame?

09:36.724 --> 09:37.989
It's a percentage.

09:37.991 --> 09:39.791
You're upset. I get it.

09:39.793 --> 09:42.862
It really is the better photo
you took today.

09:42.864 --> 09:44.566
That's it?

09:45.633 --> 09:47.667
Sorry I took your breath away.

09:47.669 --> 09:48.935
Really?

10:02.617 --> 10:04.450
- No.
- What's going on?

10:04.452 --> 10:06.052
Fuck. I thought
this would have gone quicker.

10:06.054 --> 10:07.487
Huh?

10:07.489 --> 10:09.089
Listen, I'm gonna tell you

10:09.091 --> 10:10.623
my name to establish trust.

10:10.625 --> 10:11.926
I think it's a little
too late for that.

10:11.928 --> 10:13.427
Well, that's up to you,
but these men

10:13.429 --> 10:15.062
headed up this way
will seriously harm you.

10:15.064 --> 10:16.730
- For what?
- Talkin' to me.

10:16.732 --> 10:18.032
Are you serious?

10:18.034 --> 10:19.667
I'm Natalie. You?

10:19.669 --> 10:21.769
- Uh, Ho-Hollis...
- Listen, Hollis.

10:21.771 --> 10:24.340
You and me and this photograph
need to leave right now.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.042
- I-I believe you.
- Good. Let's go.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.844
- Uh, w-what about my stuff?
- There's no time.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.648
Well, where are we going?

12:29.871 --> 12:31.571
Gotta get outta town.

12:31.573 --> 12:35.173
I, uh, I'm not getting
on a train with you.

12:35.175 --> 12:38.044
Train's a death trap
in situations like this.

12:38.046 --> 12:40.481
A few exits and you
can't control the stops.

12:40.483 --> 12:42.719
But then why are we here?

12:44.085 --> 12:46.856
Just do what everyone else
does. Just look around.

12:48.858 --> 12:51.525
Why can't you just
drop me off at the police?

12:51.527 --> 12:53.895
The police can't help you.

12:54.530 --> 12:56.230
Well, what if I say no?

12:56.232 --> 12:58.631
Fortunately for you,
my protection comes

12:58.633 --> 13:01.269
with or without
your cooperation.

13:01.271 --> 13:03.505
What are you, a 140 pounds?

13:03.507 --> 13:05.943
You'll slow me down,
but not that much.

13:08.110 --> 13:11.246
Why do you care
what happens to me?

13:11.248 --> 13:14.848
Because I know
what will happen to you.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.021
Wait. W-what does that mean?

14:23.189 --> 14:24.825
Who are you?

14:40.773 --> 14:42.741
Where are we goin'?

14:42.743 --> 14:45.142
Out of town.

14:45.144 --> 14:48.246
What, conversation's not
one of your special skills?

14:48.248 --> 14:51.083
You could have answers
or you could be dead.

14:51.085 --> 14:54.885
If I had answers, this would
feel less like a kidnapping.

14:54.887 --> 14:58.091
How did you find my apartment
after you saw me in the park?

14:58.926 --> 15:00.996
And who's after us?

15:02.998 --> 15:05.234
Is there anything
you can tell me?

15:06.334 --> 15:08.604
I'm sorry, sincerely.

16:08.331 --> 16:10.567
Can you stop the car, please?

16:11.368 --> 16:13.370
Not going to happen.

16:15.372 --> 16:17.274
I feel sick.

16:55.314 --> 16:57.012
Where's the spectacle?

16:57.014 --> 16:59.618
Huh? It passed.

17:02.254 --> 17:04.887
It's time you start
betting on me.

17:04.890 --> 17:07.058
Why?

17:07.060 --> 17:08.492
Because one of us
isn't a stranger

17:08.493 --> 17:10.730
to situations like this.

17:17.236 --> 17:19.238
But since you disagree...

17:22.375 --> 17:24.012
here you go.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.815
I, I have nothing to do
with this.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.251
I just took a picture
of you, that's all.

17:32.253 --> 17:33.918
When they find you,
and they will

17:33.920 --> 17:35.521
you're gonna need something
to defend yourself.

17:35.523 --> 17:37.257
Against who?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.859
At 18 you received a diploma.

17:40.861 --> 17:43.028
Folks behind us

17:43.030 --> 17:46.264
they were handed a Beretta M9.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.966
It also happens to be
the official side armor

17:47.968 --> 17:49.835
for military, unlike them

17:49.837 --> 17:51.937
they load these weapons
with jacketed hollow points

17:51.939 --> 17:55.241
that achieve a velocity
of 400 meters per second.

17:55.243 --> 17:58.043
Incredible stopping power.

17:58.045 --> 18:01.682
Designed to leave extra-large
bloody holes in their target.

18:04.119 --> 18:06.052
What the fuck is wrong with you?

18:09.291 --> 18:10.990
This is real.

18:10.992 --> 18:12.592
In less than an hour
they will catch up to you

18:12.594 --> 18:14.460
and open fire in seconds.

18:14.462 --> 18:18.364
So if I were you, I would swing
that tool as fast as I can.

18:18.366 --> 18:20.868
Maybe one less bullet
disrupt your frame

18:20.870 --> 18:22.902
which makes all the difference
in the authority's ability

18:22.904 --> 18:24.905
to ID your body

18:24.907 --> 18:28.108
allows for the funeral
you deserve.

18:28.110 --> 18:29.442
Whether you swing
that thing or not

18:29.444 --> 18:31.747
it's going to be
a closed casket.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.831
Or we stay together
and you bet on me.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.349
F-f-fuck!

20:05.211 --> 20:08.415
Couldn't you have picked a car
with satellite radio?

20:10.149 --> 20:13.318
Humor. You're relaxing.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.988
Just getting used
to a new normal.

20:15.990 --> 20:17.591
It's not forever.

20:21.729 --> 20:23.665
What's in Nevada?

20:24.598 --> 20:26.632
Not our destination.

20:26.634 --> 20:28.269
Which is?

20:30.437 --> 20:31.670
Phoenix.

20:31.672 --> 20:33.972
Arizona?

20:33.974 --> 20:36.209
Yep, that one.

20:36.211 --> 20:38.011
- Ever been?
- No.

20:38.013 --> 20:40.579
- You?
- Yes.

20:40.581 --> 20:42.115
Well, then you know
this isn't the right way.

20:42.117 --> 20:44.149
We've gotta get on the ten.

20:44.151 --> 20:46.386
Yeah, that's the way
everyone goes to Phoenix.

20:46.388 --> 20:48.387
I hope they send the people
who are following us

20:48.389 --> 20:50.056
won't know where we are heading.

20:50.058 --> 20:52.591
In case I'm wrong,
the extra added time and space

20:52.593 --> 20:55.194
will make them think
we went somewhere else.

20:55.196 --> 20:57.530
And-and after
this extra-scenic round

20:57.532 --> 20:59.369
what's waiting for us there?

21:01.036 --> 21:03.503
A safe place.

21:03.505 --> 21:06.610
Somewhere I can protect you
until this is over.

21:09.579 --> 21:10.981
Who are you?

21:12.314 --> 21:14.281
Look, I-I mean,
I think I'm already there

21:14.283 --> 21:16.384
but just help me
tip the ball in.

21:16.386 --> 21:19.052
Law enforcement? Government?

21:19.054 --> 21:22.358
"And zoom straight to the moon
with you, Alice."

21:24.527 --> 21:27.661
"Ho-Honeymooners?"
How old are you?

21:27.663 --> 21:29.432
Jackie Gleason.

21:31.267 --> 21:33.534
Funny man. I thought you'd
appreciate the black and white.

21:33.536 --> 21:36.237
Yeah, fair enough. You're
not gonna tell me who you are.

21:36.239 --> 21:37.807
Ah, your deal?

21:44.480 --> 21:48.117
Our paths crossed while
I was in transition of sorts.

21:48.119 --> 21:51.120
Oh, we could say the same thing.

21:51.122 --> 21:54.759
Um, burdening your soul on me
won't benefit either of us.

21:55.727 --> 21:58.527
Well, you really do live
on front street.

21:58.529 --> 22:01.229
- Referring to my honesty?
- And your blunt delivery.

22:01.231 --> 22:02.297
It's effective.

22:02.299 --> 22:04.403
I was gonna say rude.

22:36.603 --> 22:38.236
Bathroom's yours. Go ahead.

22:38.238 --> 22:41.139
You know what?
I think I'll hold it.

22:41.141 --> 22:44.141
I didn't know the princess
required five stars.

22:51.418 --> 22:53.420
Get whatever you want.

23:10.171 --> 23:12.406
Is there a real meal
in my future?

23:13.340 --> 23:15.409
Why ask if there's not?

23:16.344 --> 23:19.178
Thought you might say that.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.783
What part of this
feels like a vacation?

23:28.523 --> 23:32.159
The clerk is watching me.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.827
Stop giving him a reason to.

23:34.829 --> 23:37.065
Is there toothbrush
in front of you?

23:39.367 --> 23:41.870
- Yes.
- Could you grab one?

23:43.872 --> 23:46.175
What are you gonna do with it?

23:49.444 --> 23:50.946
Brush my teeth.

23:52.248 --> 23:54.481
- Alright.
- One toothpaste, too, please.

23:54.483 --> 23:56.483
Colgate, if they have it.

23:56.485 --> 23:58.419
Hm, priorities. Colgate.

23:58.421 --> 24:01.189
Dental hygiene.
Uh, c-can I get one?

24:01.191 --> 24:04.424
It is recommended.
Prevents cavities.

24:04.426 --> 24:06.426
I know you don't think
this is a joke.

24:06.428 --> 24:07.662
Right again.

24:07.664 --> 24:09.462
But you're screwing
with my life!

24:09.464 --> 24:11.569
No, I am saving it.

24:16.407 --> 24:18.574
Well, to-tonight's plan?

24:18.576 --> 24:21.676
- I deserve to know that much.
- Relax.

24:21.678 --> 24:23.311
You're gonna get
your beauty rest

24:23.313 --> 24:26.082
and this fantasy meal
you have in mind, okay?

24:28.452 --> 24:30.786
Okay.

24:30.788 --> 24:33.491
- Happy?
- Okay.

25:12.864 --> 25:15.532
- Hi. Two for tonight?
- Yes, please.

25:15.534 --> 25:16.936
Yeah, please.

25:25.746 --> 25:28.346
Your server, Savannah,
will be with you

25:28.348 --> 25:29.848
in a second
to get you started.

25:29.850 --> 25:31.285
Thank you.

25:32.852 --> 25:35.088
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

25:39.892 --> 25:41.926
As you requested.

25:41.928 --> 25:44.265
Well, you sure know
how to treat a fellow.

25:46.033 --> 25:48.434
See anything you like?

25:48.436 --> 25:51.970
"Diner signs up for mediocrity
by definition."

25:51.972 --> 25:53.005
How so?

25:53.007 --> 25:54.040
Well, basically saying that

25:54.042 --> 25:55.507
we do a little bit of everything

25:55.509 --> 25:56.775
and we'll make it somewhat
palatable

25:56.777 --> 25:58.410
as you choke it down

25:58.412 --> 26:01.514
but we're not here to make
any one thing great.

26:01.516 --> 26:02.814
Well, you thought
a lot about this.

26:02.816 --> 26:04.316
Well, you asked me
what I might be getting

26:04.318 --> 26:05.685
here's my advice.

26:05.687 --> 26:07.887
Place like this,
breakfast for dinner.

26:07.889 --> 26:09.921
That's the move here.

26:09.923 --> 26:12.892
Well, you'll have to excuse me
if I don't do the same.

26:12.894 --> 26:14.995
Must have a decent salad.

26:14.997 --> 26:17.096
Well, good luck with that.
I warned you.

26:17.098 --> 26:19.466
Welcome. You guys
ready to order?

26:19.468 --> 26:21.901
Cobb salad, dressing on the side
and an unsweetened tea, please.

26:21.903 --> 26:25.037
- You got it. For you?
- Can I get eggs and bacon?

26:25.039 --> 26:27.807
And can I add a sausage link
and a piece of ham steak?

26:27.809 --> 26:29.842
- The Kid Texas?
- Exactly.

26:29.844 --> 26:31.711
I should have ordered
by name for fun.

26:31.713 --> 26:35.115
Coming right up. Don't steal
anything from me, okay?

26:40.690 --> 26:43.557
Who or what is a Kid Texas?

26:43.559 --> 26:46.026
Yeah, I can't imagine
that trouble across the pond

26:46.028 --> 26:48.895
in ye Old England. Hm.

26:50.767 --> 26:53.433
- Alright.
- Thank you.

26:53.435 --> 26:54.901
That was Monday.

26:54.903 --> 26:57.638
Tuesday was the casing
of the joint.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.641
Check doors, count windows

26:59.643 --> 27:02.411
identify the security systems,
its strengths and weaknesses

27:02.413 --> 27:04.479
check for both entry points
and quick exits

27:04.481 --> 27:05.881
should there arise a need.

27:05.883 --> 27:08.150
Wednesday, gather
any necessary equipment

27:08.152 --> 27:09.617
based on the primitive search.

27:09.619 --> 27:12.054
Thursday, game on. Break in.

27:12.056 --> 27:14.789
Take what he recognizes,
valuable, and get out.

27:14.791 --> 27:17.793
Friday and Saturday, travel. Get
as far from town as possible.

27:17.795 --> 27:19.527
Trade or sell
what he couldn't keep

27:19.529 --> 27:21.130
and when it was Sunday morning

27:21.132 --> 27:23.900
again, I think
he robbed 13, 14 houses.

27:23.902 --> 27:26.169
And how did he get caught?

27:26.171 --> 27:28.070
Still don't get
why they call him Texas

27:28.072 --> 27:29.838
if he worked his way
through the Northwest.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.442
Good question, and they both
have the same answer

27:32.444 --> 27:34.778
which makes the story so cool.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.980
Thursday mornings,
day of the heist

27:37.982 --> 27:40.482
game day is ritual.

27:40.484 --> 27:43.853
He'd go to the nearest diner
and order this exact breakfast.

27:43.855 --> 27:45.822
One scrambled egg,
one sausage link

27:45.824 --> 27:48.361
one piece of bacon,
one slice of ham steak.

27:49.561 --> 27:50.894
It was off the children's menu.

27:50.896 --> 27:51.929
- They called it...
- A Kid Texas.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.897
Yeah, and after nine houses in

27:53.899 --> 27:55.766
the authorities linked
all these robbers together

27:55.768 --> 27:57.535
and started to map it out.

27:57.537 --> 27:59.569
They'd have the managers
of the local diners call

27:59.571 --> 28:02.138
if anyone between the ages
of ten or eighteen

28:02.140 --> 28:04.875
dined by themselves
and ordered that.

28:04.877 --> 28:06.544
It wasn't the most
perfect of plans

28:06.546 --> 28:08.782
but they eventually
apprehended the guy.

28:11.551 --> 28:13.688
Story of Kid Texas.

28:15.088 --> 28:17.323
I don't know if I believe it.

28:19.059 --> 28:21.827
Well, it's your prerogative.

28:21.829 --> 28:24.064
Call it a legend
if you re-tell it.

28:26.867 --> 28:28.703
I'll use the bathroom.

28:29.570 --> 28:31.138
I'll get the check.

28:32.505 --> 28:34.205
Thanks for the food break.

28:34.207 --> 28:35.910
You're welcome.

28:38.545 --> 28:41.214
- Here you go.
- Okay, keep the change.

28:41.216 --> 28:42.851
Thanks.

28:50.058 --> 28:52.027
This is crazy.

29:13.082 --> 29:15.183
And where are you headed?

29:22.024 --> 29:23.460
Oh...

29:25.195 --> 29:27.695
This is exactly the kind
of attention we don't want.

29:27.697 --> 29:31.198
- Guys climbing out of windows.
- Uh, what? We?

29:31.200 --> 29:33.267
Do-don't act like we're a team.

29:33.269 --> 29:35.870
You say if I leave you,
they'll find and kill me

29:35.872 --> 29:37.205
but I'm not so sure
that sticking with you

29:37.207 --> 29:39.006
doesn't end with me
being dead, as well.

29:39.008 --> 29:41.008
Risk versus reward.

29:41.010 --> 29:42.843
Did you learn
the art of conversation

29:42.845 --> 29:44.078
from a fortune cookie?

29:44.080 --> 29:45.178
Have I said anything so far

29:45.180 --> 29:46.215
you don't understand?

29:46.217 --> 29:47.815
No, it's just very terse.

29:47.817 --> 29:50.119
It lacks nuance.

29:50.121 --> 29:53.557
- It's by design.
- Copy that, RoboCop.

29:56.561 --> 29:59.294
- I'm not a police officer.
- I can't do this anymore.

29:59.296 --> 30:01.630
There are less comfortable
ways of doing this, you know?

30:01.632 --> 30:03.968
More threats.

30:06.871 --> 30:08.836
My patience has
a tendency to dissipate

30:08.838 --> 30:11.908
and my kindness
has been known to expire.

30:11.910 --> 30:15.146
Oh. Message received,
loud and clear.

30:16.213 --> 30:18.950
My way of speaking
must be contagious.

31:03.262 --> 31:04.898
Hold on.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.227
Okay, let's go.

31:39.134 --> 31:41.401
One room and two beds, please.

31:41.403 --> 31:44.439
At this time I've only got
rooms with a single bed.

31:46.175 --> 31:47.677
It's fine.

31:53.014 --> 31:54.882
So, uh, are you two staying

31:54.884 --> 31:56.485
for the whole night?

32:00.121 --> 32:01.390
Yes.

32:02.258 --> 32:03.693
It's 50.

32:11.033 --> 32:12.466
I'll have your change
in the morning.

32:12.468 --> 32:13.902
Sure.

32:13.904 --> 32:16.271
It's room 12,
checkout's at 11:00.

32:16.273 --> 32:18.239
Excuse me, d-do you
happen to know

32:18.241 --> 32:20.477
the thread count
on the sheets here?

32:22.145 --> 32:24.448
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

32:25.916 --> 32:27.351
No.

32:47.437 --> 32:50.141
So how does this work?

32:55.079 --> 32:57.445
You take the bed,
grab a few hours of sleep

32:57.447 --> 32:59.750
I'll take watch
and then we'll switch.

32:59.752 --> 33:02.455
Is that really necessary?

33:03.154 --> 33:05.288
Yes.

33:05.290 --> 33:07.757
Are you watching me
or out the window?

33:07.759 --> 33:10.495
What about the time I watched
you come out of a window?

33:11.964 --> 33:14.063
Gas station, there were
two closed-circuit cameras

33:14.065 --> 33:15.799
five witnesses at the diner.

33:15.801 --> 33:18.502
Less of an issue
when we are on the move

33:18.504 --> 33:20.369
but now that we are staying put

33:20.371 --> 33:22.139
it would allow for the people
who are following us

33:22.141 --> 33:24.841
to gain back
some of the distance.

33:24.843 --> 33:26.843
In case they do,
I would like to know that

33:26.845 --> 33:28.178
so when it's your turn
to take watch

33:28.180 --> 33:30.650
I expect you
to take it seriously.

33:35.487 --> 33:37.156
Great talk.

33:38.391 --> 33:41.127
Sure enough, that won't
give me nightmares.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.281
I can't sleep.

34:05.152 --> 34:07.654
I'm serious.
What do you recommend?

34:10.357 --> 34:13.091
Sheep, white fence.

34:13.092 --> 34:16.464
How many of them jump over
in identical succession?

34:17.899 --> 34:19.130
It's classic for a reason.

34:19.132 --> 34:20.399
You had to fuckin' drive?

34:20.400 --> 34:22.201
I don't care
if you could water ski.

34:22.203 --> 34:24.337
No one's talkin' about driving.

34:24.339 --> 34:26.038
- I was talking about...
- Yeah.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.440
I'll tell you what, it seems
like there is somebody

34:27.442 --> 34:29.141
fuckin' talkin' about drivin'

34:29.143 --> 34:31.844
and that's this guy.

34:31.846 --> 34:33.212
You just, I want you to listen.

34:33.214 --> 34:35.416
You are mine, alright?

34:35.418 --> 34:37.885
All of it, even those
fucked-up ears of yours.

34:37.887 --> 34:39.152
The shit don't even
dangle properly.

34:39.155 --> 34:41.554
- Oh, fuck you!
- Fuck me? No.

34:41.556 --> 34:42.989
- Fuck you!
- Listen, listen to me.

34:42.992 --> 34:45.592
- Oh.
- You're gonna respect me.

34:45.594 --> 34:47.027
Will you listen to me?

34:47.029 --> 34:50.998
So many fucking rules. Yeah!

34:51.000 --> 34:52.931
Some bling
for your pimp hand, huh?

34:52.934 --> 34:54.300
- I'm pimp?
- Yeah.

34:54.302 --> 34:56.302
You want, you want me
to show you pimp?

34:56.304 --> 34:58.874
- Huh? Oh, oh?
- Don't, don't.

34:58.876 --> 35:01.542
- Don't! I'm serious.
- Loosen up. Come on!

35:01.544 --> 35:04.212
Huh, you're serious about,
what are you serious about?

35:12.388 --> 35:15.893
- That's fucking gross.
- Oh.

35:24.902 --> 35:26.969
I don't wanna fucking
do that right now.

35:26.971 --> 35:28.670
- Let go of me!
- You don't want it?

35:28.672 --> 35:31.673
- Do you not fucking want it?
- Get the fuck away from me.

35:31.675 --> 35:35.280
Don't...
Oh, God! Ow.

35:38.516 --> 35:40.215
- Ow!
- Natalie?

35:41.286 --> 35:43.219
Holy shit!

35:45.023 --> 35:46.990
What is it, huh?
Do you see something?

35:46.992 --> 35:50.127
Guy's beating on this girl.

35:50.129 --> 35:52.328
You woke me up because
you're people-watching?

35:52.330 --> 35:54.598
- She's in trouble.
- Not our problem.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.537
- Well, I'm going out there.
- No, you're not.

35:58.937 --> 36:00.403
You're not gonna
shoot me for trying

36:00.405 --> 36:03.272
to help a stranger in need.

36:03.274 --> 36:06.542
- You don't know me.
- Use my back as a target.

36:06.544 --> 36:09.145
Light the whole building up.

36:09.147 --> 36:12.351
- Fuck off, Graham. Graham.
- Or what?

36:14.386 --> 36:17.255
- Alright, that's enough.
- Stop. Fuck you.

36:17.257 --> 36:18.723
- Walk away, man.
- Oh, I'm serious.

36:18.725 --> 36:20.157
Let her go. Leave her alone.

36:20.159 --> 36:21.592
You don't speak for her
or talk to me.

36:21.594 --> 36:23.161
Now walk the fuck away.

36:23.163 --> 36:24.728
Hey, hey, hey.
Just, just cool down, okay?

36:24.730 --> 36:26.264
- I don't want any trouble!
- Cool down? Told you.

36:26.266 --> 36:27.632
You should have
walked the fucked away.

36:27.634 --> 36:30.034
- Let him go!
- Shut the fuck up!

36:30.036 --> 36:31.703
- He doesn't wanna fight...
- Shut the fuck up!

36:31.705 --> 36:33.070
Fuck you, Graham.

36:33.072 --> 36:34.138
Fucker's stuck his neck

36:34.140 --> 36:35.640
where it doesn't belong.

36:38.479 --> 36:40.982
Oh, come on, Graham, don't!

36:43.383 --> 36:45.219
Balance is off.

36:46.253 --> 36:48.253
Weight's not
properly distributed.

36:49.590 --> 36:52.291
It won't deliver
the blow you think.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.325
Oh, yeah, is this
your little turd?

36:54.327 --> 36:55.760
I'll tell you what,
you wait, you wait here

36:55.762 --> 36:57.162
I'll get you next.

36:57.164 --> 36:58.800
Don't like waiting.

36:59.567 --> 37:02.067
Builds anticipation.

37:02.069 --> 37:03.536
I don't know about you,
but it never

37:03.538 --> 37:05.371
really lives up
to my expectations.

37:05.373 --> 37:10.076
Oh? Yes, your mouth
likes to talk.

37:10.078 --> 37:12.448
Hey, I think I prefer a move...

37:13.181 --> 37:14.783
without words.

37:27.095 --> 37:30.398
- Look, ma, no hands.
- What the fuck?

37:30.400 --> 37:32.432
This man is a Neanderthal.

37:32.434 --> 37:34.135
He'll seriously end up
hurting you.

37:34.137 --> 37:36.473
- Jeez, get the fuck off.
- Ooh...

37:40.575 --> 37:42.776
Quite double standard,
don't you think?

37:42.778 --> 37:44.378
My friend here and I
were here to help you

37:44.380 --> 37:47.049
when this piece of shit
did that to you.

37:47.051 --> 37:50.085
When I strike you, it excites
him more than frightens him.

37:50.087 --> 37:51.453
Yeah, there are people
in this world

37:51.455 --> 37:53.621
who type exactly that
into a search engine

37:53.623 --> 37:55.893
five minutes before they come.

38:01.165 --> 38:02.531
Oh, fuck you.

38:02.533 --> 38:04.598
That office is open 24 hours.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.435
Y-you go in and ask,
you can use their phone

38:06.437 --> 38:08.502
and press charges
against this thing.

38:08.504 --> 38:11.574
Find a new companion before
your life gets any worse.

38:11.576 --> 38:15.144
- Ah...
- Fuck off. Shit!

38:15.146 --> 38:16.781
Come on, Graham. Come on.

38:19.416 --> 38:21.452
Thanks for your help.

38:23.121 --> 38:26.088
You did the exact opposite of
everything I've asked you to do.

38:26.090 --> 38:29.825
- Well, she was in trouble.
- Our trouble trumps hers.

38:29.827 --> 38:32.095
If you really don't want
to live, that's your problem

38:32.097 --> 38:34.531
but the second you jeopardize
my life, it becomes mine

38:34.533 --> 38:38.234
and I have enough fucking
problems. Do you understand?

38:38.236 --> 38:40.572
- Uh.
- Good.

38:42.640 --> 38:44.509
You have a big heart.

38:46.412 --> 38:48.611
Thank you.

38:48.613 --> 38:51.616
Yeah. You'll only break
into more pieces.

39:00.559 --> 39:02.293
Wake me in three hours.

39:02.295 --> 39:05.399
Keep watching,
do not leave the room.

39:07.701 --> 39:09.136
Then what?

39:11.137 --> 39:13.874
Phoenix. Plan hasn't changed.

40:39.797 --> 40:44.433
- Good. You're ready to go?
- No, I need more.

40:44.435 --> 40:47.636
- What, like, breakfast?
- Like, answers.

40:47.638 --> 40:50.239
I need to know more if I'm gonna
get back in that car with you

40:50.241 --> 40:51.806
otherwise, I dead bolt that door

40:51.808 --> 40:54.409
take my chances
and wait this out.

40:54.411 --> 40:56.411
The less you know, the better.

40:56.413 --> 40:58.615
That was yesterday.

40:58.617 --> 41:01.584
Today's a different tune.

41:01.586 --> 41:03.686
And before you tell me
that I don't have the clearance

41:03.688 --> 41:07.289
or some shit like that,
save it...

41:07.291 --> 41:09.560
'cause I don't think
you do anymore.

41:23.808 --> 41:26.643
Alright, a division of the
British Intelligence I was in

41:26.645 --> 41:29.879
wasn't exactly known
for their retirement plans.

41:29.881 --> 41:33.049
So when they were replacing
the need for what I do best

41:33.051 --> 41:34.784
I decided to make
a move on my own

41:34.786 --> 41:38.157
before the inevitable push.
They didn't like this.

41:39.991 --> 41:43.594
The Queen? Her Majesty's men
are chasing us?

41:43.596 --> 41:47.234
No. Angry,
well-armed Colombians.

41:51.070 --> 41:52.705
Why?

41:53.639 --> 41:55.506
When I was stationed in Arizona

41:55.508 --> 41:57.575
one of my assignments
was to broker a deal

41:57.577 --> 42:01.079
between a major British bank
and the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel

42:01.081 --> 42:04.548
give them a place to stash
their laundered money.

42:04.550 --> 42:07.584
It's common practice
and it was a success.

42:07.586 --> 42:09.320
I managed on the account
for years

42:09.322 --> 42:12.991
and when it was clear
my time was up with the agency

42:12.993 --> 42:15.593
I commenced work
on my exit strategy.

42:15.595 --> 42:18.431
Well, you don't just
shake hands with anyone.

42:18.433 --> 42:20.765
- What does that mean?
- You're a greedy opportunist.

42:20.767 --> 42:23.835
I've heard about these
good Samaritans of Sinaloa.

42:23.837 --> 42:27.640
- It was my job.
- It was? How about now?

42:27.642 --> 42:29.542
But what's this got to do
with the Colombians?

42:29.544 --> 42:32.844
Their money dried up,
not their product or work ethic.

42:32.846 --> 42:34.847
So on leaving the biz

42:34.849 --> 42:37.751
you thought you'd foster
some competition

42:37.753 --> 42:40.686
ignite old feuds.

42:40.688 --> 42:42.856
And it was brilliant
in its simplicity.

42:42.858 --> 42:45.592
Siphoned off close to
a 100 million of Sinaloa's funds

42:45.594 --> 42:47.897
and bankrolled the Colombians.

42:49.364 --> 42:51.630
In return for?

42:51.632 --> 42:54.934
An annual stipend that gives me
liquid for the rest of my life.

42:54.936 --> 42:56.670
But why are they after you?

42:56.672 --> 42:59.073
I came to Los Angeles
to complete the deal in person

42:59.075 --> 43:02.377
with the cartel. Neutral ground.

43:02.379 --> 43:04.412
En route to the meet

43:04.414 --> 43:05.912
the Sinaloa cartel shut down

43:05.914 --> 43:08.850
or moved all the money
out of their bank.

43:08.852 --> 43:12.120
I don't know if it was my former
boss that tipped them off or...

43:12.122 --> 43:14.888
I don't know,
the worst kind of luck...

43:14.890 --> 43:17.924
And I had no angle to play.

43:17.926 --> 43:19.560
I tried to explain to them
what happened

43:19.562 --> 43:21.963
but they didn't take it well.

43:21.965 --> 43:23.931
I barely escaped with my life.

43:23.933 --> 43:26.000
I claimed three of theirs
and I was in the middle

43:26.002 --> 43:28.639
of disappearing
when you captured me.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.141
Oh.

43:33.143 --> 43:35.844
On film.

43:35.846 --> 43:39.514
They think I betrayed them and
it doesn't matter that I didn't.

43:39.516 --> 43:42.387
I took out their lieutenant
and now they want me dead.

43:44.422 --> 43:45.858
Sorry.

43:48.193 --> 43:50.526
Yeah.

43:50.528 --> 43:53.899
So if it's okay with you,
can we move on now?

43:56.968 --> 43:58.704
Pretty please?

44:03.207 --> 44:04.941
With fucking cherries.

45:11.011 --> 45:13.280
Don't they have a signature
thing that they do?

45:14.815 --> 45:17.616
You know, it's, uh,
it's-it's like a bow tie.

45:17.618 --> 45:20.620
Necktie. Colombian necktie.

45:20.622 --> 45:22.523
And that's when you put
the what inside the what again?

45:22.525 --> 45:24.858
Just don't think about it, okay?

45:24.860 --> 45:26.193
Nothing's changed.

45:26.195 --> 45:28.762
But then how can I
not think about it?

45:28.764 --> 45:32.164
Dying is inevitable,
one way or the other.

45:32.166 --> 45:35.104
So there's absolutely no point
giving it any thought.

45:36.170 --> 45:39.007
Focus should be
on staying alive.

45:41.142 --> 45:44.644
It takes training,
but I can help you.

45:44.646 --> 45:46.848
Focus on something else,
something positive.

45:51.555 --> 45:54.556
In your apartment
there was a framed photograph

45:54.558 --> 45:57.692
of you and a woman. Girlfriend?

45:57.694 --> 46:00.027
Well, you said
something positive.

46:00.029 --> 46:01.831
Ex-girlfriend then.

46:03.033 --> 46:04.765
You can still work with that.

46:04.767 --> 46:06.935
I'm not gonna talk to you
about my relationship.

46:06.937 --> 46:09.169
Why? I'm a good listener.

46:11.976 --> 46:13.242
Something funny?

46:13.244 --> 46:16.080
Oh, not at all.

46:20.717 --> 46:22.153
What's her name?

46:25.956 --> 46:27.258
Abigail.

46:31.728 --> 46:33.796
So she's your ex-girlfriend,
but you still have

46:33.798 --> 46:35.899
a framed photograph
of the two of you.

46:35.901 --> 46:37.968
It's a good photo.

46:37.970 --> 46:39.836
If you insist.

46:39.838 --> 46:42.171
You know, it doesn't matter.

46:42.173 --> 46:44.475
None of it matters
anymore, does it?

46:49.180 --> 46:52.915
She's seeing
someone else, anyway.

46:52.917 --> 46:56.087
I saw them together before
you turned up on my doorstep.

46:58.857 --> 47:01.224
And you regret
breaking it up with her.

47:01.226 --> 47:04.396
- How'd you know?
- What happened?

47:07.833 --> 47:10.637
I... I was an asshole.

47:12.270 --> 47:15.074
Got to this place where
I hated the comfort of it.

47:16.141 --> 47:18.445
Felt like I was settling.

47:19.911 --> 47:22.216
We were together
for five years and...

47:23.716 --> 47:26.120
I thought that maybe
I could do better.

47:28.856 --> 47:30.955
I don't know, it turned me
into an awful person.

47:30.957 --> 47:34.258
I was drinking a lot and, uh...

47:34.260 --> 47:36.662
finally she had enough
of this, you know?

47:36.664 --> 47:38.199
Walked out.

47:41.300 --> 47:44.202
You know, just because you
haven't found a better companion

47:44.204 --> 47:46.938
this, this break up doesn't mean
you made a mistake.

47:46.940 --> 47:48.440
No.

47:48.442 --> 47:50.945
No, but I still made a mistake.

47:52.447 --> 47:54.249
I really loved her.

47:54.815 --> 47:57.116
I still do.

47:57.118 --> 48:00.454
And I traded the yes for a maybe
and I can't even tell you why.

48:01.822 --> 48:03.355
You know, I-I really
had a chance with her

48:03.357 --> 48:06.694
and I fucked it up and now
I may never get another.

48:11.200 --> 48:12.502
Hollis...

48:14.936 --> 48:17.172
when we get to Phoenix
you'll be safe.

48:19.075 --> 48:20.944
You'll get your chance.

50:03.248 --> 50:05.084
So where's his house?

50:06.219 --> 50:09.388
Around the corner,
then down half a block.

50:09.390 --> 50:11.156
What, you don't wanna be closer?

50:11.158 --> 50:13.091
No.

50:13.093 --> 50:15.326
Uh, but the street's empty.

50:15.328 --> 50:18.029
Deliberate choice.

50:18.031 --> 50:20.198
Uh, uh, just so we're clear

50:20.200 --> 50:22.433
you don't trust the guy
at the alleged safe haven?

50:22.435 --> 50:23.901
You're thinking
about this wrong.

50:23.903 --> 50:25.470
I wasn't thinking
about it at all

50:25.472 --> 50:27.272
but now I'm more worried
than before.

50:27.274 --> 50:30.142
- Good. Use that fear.
- What?

50:30.144 --> 50:33.478
Be cautious.
That will get you far.

50:33.480 --> 50:35.547
Oh, um, I can't believe
I'm asking this again

50:35.549 --> 50:38.518
but do you know
what you're doing here?

50:38.520 --> 50:41.954
This is the right choice.
This man can help.

50:41.956 --> 50:44.023
But your parking
would suggest otherwise.

50:44.025 --> 50:46.226
In our profession,
shared-by or host

50:46.228 --> 50:48.597
to trust is a luxury
we can't afford.

50:51.900 --> 50:54.136
Is he gonna be happy to see you?

50:56.605 --> 51:00.573
When I left my post in Arizona,
I also left behind Rodney.

51:00.575 --> 51:02.308
- You guys were a thing?
- Our marriage was...

51:02.310 --> 51:03.444
He's your husband?

51:03.446 --> 51:04.879
- No.
- Ex-husband?

51:04.881 --> 51:06.513
A marriage arranged
by the agency.

51:06.515 --> 51:08.314
- For real?
- To solidify our cover.

51:08.316 --> 51:10.917
- And to spy on America?
- Among other things.

51:10.919 --> 51:12.554
Aren't we allies?

51:15.156 --> 51:17.393
What happened between you two?

51:19.195 --> 51:20.996
Even though we weren't
working side by side

51:20.998 --> 51:24.135
Rodney would have preferred
if I had remained by his...

51:25.601 --> 51:27.838
continued to be his wife.

51:30.674 --> 51:33.074
Oh, this is just great.

51:44.121 --> 51:47.225
C-can't you just do your thing?

51:49.260 --> 51:51.696
You know, your, uh,
your-your thing.

51:53.064 --> 51:55.300
I don't think Rodney
would appreciate that.

51:58.602 --> 52:00.970
Come on. I know a place
we can go in the meantime.

52:18.056 --> 52:20.726
I like it here. It's humbling.

52:28.299 --> 52:29.802
Where are you from?

52:35.175 --> 52:36.944
Just outside London.

52:38.545 --> 52:41.747
I was instructed for the longest
time to stay right here...

52:44.217 --> 52:45.749
but whenever
I didn't feel like it

52:45.751 --> 52:50.323
I would come out here
and take a break from it all.

52:51.057 --> 52:53.057
From British espionage?

52:53.059 --> 52:56.093
No, from pretending.

52:56.095 --> 52:59.366
I've spent so much time
in America trying to fit in.

53:00.533 --> 53:03.736
Away from everyone,
surrounded by strangers.

53:03.738 --> 53:06.605
Well, that can happen

53:06.607 --> 53:08.610
even if you're from here.

53:11.145 --> 53:12.678
It's isolating.

53:12.680 --> 53:15.714
- Well, it was your job.
- Yeah.

53:15.716 --> 53:19.654
- A unique line of work.
- Considered it more of a duty.

53:21.757 --> 53:24.324
Yes, but at some points,
the payment didn't match up

53:24.326 --> 53:26.592
with the price.

53:26.594 --> 53:28.329
Emotional toll?

53:29.431 --> 53:31.700
I used to believe in what I do.

53:33.168 --> 53:35.404
I just don't know
when it stopped.

53:43.411 --> 53:45.446
"Vitameatavegamin."

53:45.448 --> 53:47.247
Excuse me?

53:47.249 --> 53:50.518
That wasn't a part
of your upbringing?

53:50.520 --> 53:54.355
It's considered the most famous
episode of "I Love Lucy."

53:56.426 --> 53:58.158
Can't believe
you haven't seen it.

53:58.160 --> 54:01.294
Yeah, I think I may
have missed that class.

54:01.296 --> 54:04.564
Huh. I used to get a few laughs
from that one at dinner parties.

54:10.306 --> 54:12.008
What about your job?

54:13.177 --> 54:14.645
Taking pictures?

54:15.712 --> 54:17.244
You know, Arizona is the home

54:17.246 --> 54:19.713
to the largest
Native-American reservation

54:19.715 --> 54:21.382
the Navajo Nation.

54:21.384 --> 54:22.684
I didn't know that.

54:22.686 --> 54:24.119
In their culture, they consider

54:24.121 --> 54:25.554
taking a photograph of someone

54:25.556 --> 54:27.188
is like stealing their soul.

54:27.190 --> 54:29.693
No, I've never
subscribed to that.

54:31.695 --> 54:33.328
Thought you were gonna say

54:33.330 --> 54:35.263
"It doesn't matter
'cause I don't have one."

54:35.265 --> 54:38.703
Well, you're helping me.
It can't be all that bad.

54:45.776 --> 54:49.544
I really wish you'd
let me bring my camera.

55:23.483 --> 55:24.752
No?

55:28.421 --> 55:31.189
Okay.

55:36.595 --> 55:38.562
Tricky.

55:51.779 --> 55:53.481
There you go.

55:54.248 --> 55:55.683
All good.

56:02.924 --> 56:05.824
- Adios.
- Gracias.

56:08.462 --> 56:10.262
- No.
- No?

57:01.751 --> 57:03.086
Okay?

57:59.445 --> 58:03.380
Chewing, you don't
practice that anymore?

58:03.382 --> 58:04.882
It's been a while.

58:04.884 --> 58:07.650
I figured, which is why

58:07.652 --> 58:09.453
at the last minute
I decided to procure

58:09.455 --> 58:11.790
the necessary ingredients.

58:11.792 --> 58:14.058
Oh, apologies again for not
being here when you arrived.

58:14.060 --> 58:16.361
- Mm.
- No, not at all. Thank you.

58:16.363 --> 58:18.662
Hm.

58:18.664 --> 58:22.767
Hollis, are you familiar with
spreadable marshmallow paste?

58:22.769 --> 58:25.669
- Uh, yeah.
- Guess it's a sweet confection.

58:25.671 --> 58:28.339
- Isn't it?
- Uh, my mother bought Fluff.

58:28.341 --> 58:30.408
- We were brand-name snobs.
- Oh.

58:30.410 --> 58:31.642
Well, by itself,
its chemical makeup

58:31.644 --> 58:33.512
is unapologetically simple.

58:33.514 --> 58:35.081
Corn syrup, sugar syrup

58:35.083 --> 58:37.016
vanilla extracts and egg white

58:37.018 --> 58:40.585
but it's when you add
the peanut butter...

58:40.587 --> 58:42.355
That magical Fluff and Nutella.

58:42.357 --> 58:43.822
Oh, it made Natalie
weak in the knees.

58:43.824 --> 58:46.858
I mean, she'd put down
at least three a day

58:46.860 --> 58:49.462
when we shared a life.

58:49.464 --> 58:51.364
Oh, I never would have guessed.

58:51.366 --> 58:52.764
Oh, it's the absolute truth.

58:52.766 --> 58:56.535
I was, uh, partial to Nutella
and my Fluff.

58:56.537 --> 58:59.839
Hm. You were chasing
the taste of the smalls.

58:59.841 --> 59:01.640
- Yeah, I guess I was.
- Yeah.

59:01.642 --> 59:05.077
Well, I never particularly
approved neither combination.

59:05.079 --> 59:07.414
Rodney was always against
my fascination, you see?

59:07.416 --> 59:08.615
Hm, I thought
it lacked sophistication.

59:08.617 --> 59:09.915
It was a child's dish.

59:09.917 --> 59:11.151
Didn't stop me from
catching you making

59:11.153 --> 59:12.952
peanut-butter banana sandwiches.

59:12.954 --> 59:15.455
Hm, hm. Touche.

59:15.457 --> 59:18.492
I believe you Yanks call it
the, the Elvis Presley.

59:18.494 --> 59:20.029
All hail the King.

59:22.866 --> 59:24.599
Nevertheless, uh

59:24.601 --> 59:27.168
it's when I started studying
marshmallow cream

59:27.170 --> 59:29.971
that I decided
to support Natalie

59:29.973 --> 59:34.641
in her effort to anchor
her entire diet around it.

59:34.643 --> 59:37.110
Are you familiar
with its beginnings?

59:37.112 --> 59:41.081
- Uh-uh, no, not at all.
- Oh, it's fascinating.

59:41.083 --> 59:43.150
You see, it started
with this confectioner

59:43.152 --> 59:45.086
called Archibald Query.

59:45.088 --> 59:47.155
He was a resident
of Somerville, Massachusetts

59:47.157 --> 59:49.791
at 106 Bromfield Lane,
to be exact.

59:49.793 --> 59:52.461
And he was credited
with inventing it in 1917.

59:52.463 --> 59:54.562
And he was making it
in his kitchen.

59:54.564 --> 59:56.731
- And selling it door-to-door...
- But then?

59:56.733 --> 01:00:00.769
But then, World War I
caused a shortage of sugar

01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:03.004
his key ingredient,
so he had little but no choice

01:00:03.006 --> 01:00:05.874
than to sell his recipe
to these two candy makers

01:00:05.876 --> 01:00:09.112
from Lynn, Massachusetts,
Alfred Durkee and Fred Mower.

01:00:09.114 --> 01:00:11.947
This was the first incarnation

01:00:11.949 --> 01:00:14.083
to hit the store shelves.

01:00:14.085 --> 01:00:15.652
- It's fascinating.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:17.953
And yet we haven't quite
arrived at the point.

01:00:17.955 --> 01:00:20.522
- Have we?
- Yes.

01:00:20.524 --> 01:00:21.824
As you're well aware

01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:23.592
Massachusetts
is one of six states

01:00:23.594 --> 01:00:26.830
that makes up the questionable
expression New England.

01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:27.964
Uh, yes, of course.

01:00:27.966 --> 01:00:29.498
See, that's how

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.734
I rationalized it.

01:00:31.736 --> 01:00:33.736
If it could become
the brainchild of a region

01:00:33.738 --> 01:00:35.539
that was colonized
by a mother country

01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:39.843
then, I suppose, it could
very well become the staple...

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:44.283
of the New England we were
creating right here in Arizona.

01:00:47.019 --> 01:00:49.519
Rodney, you talk as if
I needed your permission.

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:52.856
- Well, I was higher in rank.
- Ah, here we go.

01:00:54.594 --> 01:00:56.093
Anyhow...

01:00:56.095 --> 01:00:58.629
when I saw that
you were heading up here

01:00:58.631 --> 01:01:02.600
I thought it only right
to prepare a proper greeting.

01:01:02.602 --> 01:01:03.935
It was delicious. Thank you.

01:01:03.937 --> 01:01:07.138
- Well, just as you remember?
- Of course.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.107
Everything pretty much is.

01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:12.746
Well, not everything.

01:01:14.147 --> 01:01:15.714
Of course. Where's Hadley?

01:01:15.716 --> 01:01:18.683
Well, he's no longer
with us, I'm afraid.

01:01:18.685 --> 01:01:21.019
- Oh, that's so sad.
- Hm.

01:01:21.021 --> 01:01:23.255
Hadley was this Maltese
poodle mix I got Rodney.

01:01:23.257 --> 01:01:25.258
- Oh, he was so cute.
- He was a stunning dog.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.291
Never shed.

01:01:34.068 --> 01:01:36.304
He was eaten by a coyote.

01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:43.043
Huh.

01:01:45.781 --> 01:01:47.781
Do you have a picture?

01:01:47.783 --> 01:01:49.850
Oh, get that one, when he's
on the couch in your office.

01:01:49.852 --> 01:01:52.487
Ah, yes. Yeah, I think I can
get my hands on that, yeah.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.825
Agent Fluffernutter.

01:01:59.827 --> 01:02:02.828
That's what I'm calling you
the rest of the night.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:05.500
That will be a good way to get
your windpipe compromised again.

01:02:08.971 --> 01:02:10.905
- There you go.
- Oh.

01:02:10.907 --> 01:02:14.074
Hey, look at that.
Handsome fellow.

01:02:15.911 --> 01:02:19.179
- Here.
- I know, he's so cute.

01:02:19.181 --> 01:02:22.282
Well, I hope you're both
sufficiently replenished.

01:02:22.284 --> 01:02:24.786
Uh, yes. Thank you.

01:02:24.788 --> 01:02:26.887
So what's next?

01:02:26.889 --> 01:02:28.989
I mean, there's a bounty
of clean towels

01:02:28.991 --> 01:02:31.726
down the hallway
if you want to clean up.

01:02:31.728 --> 01:02:34.229
Oh, that would be great.
Um, I'll shower first.

01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:36.031
I'm gonna let you two
continue to catch up.

01:02:36.033 --> 01:02:37.966
Mm-hmm.

01:02:37.968 --> 01:02:40.205
Down the hallway.
This way, yeah.

01:02:42.907 --> 01:02:45.176
- Did you click this?
- Of course.

01:03:00.092 --> 01:03:01.891
Alright, how much trouble
are you in?

01:03:01.893 --> 01:03:03.058
I'm here, aren't I?

01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.762
Oh, be honest with me, Nat.

01:03:05.764 --> 01:03:08.697
Well, you always talk
with such context.

01:03:08.699 --> 01:03:10.302
Yeah. And?

01:03:11.869 --> 01:03:13.872
It was never my thing.

01:03:15.007 --> 01:03:16.806
Look...

01:03:16.808 --> 01:03:20.144
uh, I can't help you
if you don't confide in me.

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:25.384
Just let me...

01:03:26.318 --> 01:03:29.687
warm up a bit.

01:03:29.689 --> 01:03:32.025
Huh. In the Arizona sun?

01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:34.260
No, to you...

01:03:35.794 --> 01:03:37.227
and your embrace.

01:03:37.229 --> 01:03:39.466
Hm, I'll take that.

01:03:44.169 --> 01:03:46.871
So what kind of sport
you're up?

01:03:46.873 --> 01:03:49.643
- Oh, just give me a minute.
- Oh, come on, darling.

01:03:52.846 --> 01:03:55.483
None.

01:03:58.317 --> 01:04:00.685
And the agency doesn't
know your location?

01:04:00.687 --> 01:04:03.290
No, I was running this asset
completely off-book.

01:04:04.824 --> 01:04:07.793
What kind of information
does Hollis possess?

01:04:07.795 --> 01:04:10.997
Nothing. He was more
of an eyewitness.

01:04:10.999 --> 01:04:14.066
- Same danger as me.
- Hm.

01:04:14.068 --> 01:04:15.133
You know, I don't have
the clearance

01:04:15.135 --> 01:04:17.672
to coordinate your extraction.

01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:21.343
I understand.

01:04:26.715 --> 01:04:28.350
How long do we have?

01:04:30.084 --> 01:04:33.456
We weren't followed,
but we should probably leave...

01:04:35.024 --> 01:04:37.293
in the morning,
just to be safe.

01:04:38.426 --> 01:04:40.663
Such a brief reunion?

01:04:42.497 --> 01:04:45.567
- I'm sorry for the intrusion.
- Oh, don't be dumb.

01:04:46.968 --> 01:04:48.404
Don't.

01:06:03.949 --> 01:06:06.882
- Clothes okay?
- Uh, yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

01:06:06.884 --> 01:06:08.587
They look good on you.

01:06:11.524 --> 01:06:14.825
Hm. Alright.

01:06:16.361 --> 01:06:18.062
I'm such a cliche, I know.

01:06:18.064 --> 01:06:20.131
Oh, no, I-I wasn't
thinking that.

01:06:20.133 --> 01:06:21.966
The Englishman
and his cup of tea.

01:06:23.937 --> 01:06:26.837
Mm. Mm. You sure
you don't want a cupper?

01:06:26.839 --> 01:06:30.408
Oh, no, thanks. Uh, warm liquids
play havoc with my bowels.

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:33.011
It's something to do
with my colon or something.

01:06:33.013 --> 01:06:35.849
Mm. I see. Yeah.

01:06:36.417 --> 01:06:38.317
Mm.

01:06:38.319 --> 01:06:40.117
It has been close to 20 years

01:06:40.119 --> 01:06:41.619
since I've been
a resident of the UK

01:06:41.621 --> 01:06:44.155
and it's customs like these

01:06:44.157 --> 01:06:46.058
that keep me close in spirit.

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.393
Well, I think that's great

01:06:48.395 --> 01:06:50.128
as long as it tastes good

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:53.434
and doesn't cause
extra bathroom time.

01:06:55.969 --> 01:06:57.371
Mm.

01:07:00.207 --> 01:07:01.609
Right.

01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:43.549
See, with me, my photography

01:07:43.551 --> 01:07:46.220
is both my passion
and my profession.

01:07:46.222 --> 01:07:49.392
Hm. Well, you're fortunate.
They don't always intersect.

01:07:50.526 --> 01:07:52.294
Well, how about you?

01:07:52.296 --> 01:07:54.329
Well, from the little I know,
did you always wanna do

01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:57.631
what you and Natalie do?

01:07:57.633 --> 01:07:59.202
Oh, yeah...

01:08:00.003 --> 01:08:02.403
but not as young as you did...

01:08:02.405 --> 01:08:04.972
but once I found it...

01:08:04.974 --> 01:08:07.544
I attacked it
with the same hunger.

01:08:24.995 --> 01:08:26.163
Hollis?

01:08:27.731 --> 01:08:29.966
Would you come here for a sec?

01:08:32.571 --> 01:08:35.337
Really? You're better than that.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.741
Shit.

01:08:39.377 --> 01:08:41.979
Just don't hurt him.
Let me explain.

01:08:41.981 --> 01:08:44.145
We tried that. It's too late.

01:08:44.148 --> 01:08:46.350
It's not what you think.

01:08:46.352 --> 01:08:48.720
Your EOS, the order went out.

01:08:50.522 --> 01:08:52.287
You almost got away with it.

01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:56.060
You were so close to being able
to pass through harm-free.

01:08:56.062 --> 01:08:58.729
You're offline. You wouldn't
have seen the notice.

01:08:58.732 --> 01:09:01.098
Well, that's correct, yeah,
but what are the odds of me

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.466
knowing about your status, huh?

01:09:03.469 --> 01:09:05.535
I mean, once you're out,
you're all the way out.

01:09:05.537 --> 01:09:10.008
Yet, I possess the bit of info
that you don't want me to have.

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:12.243
He's got nothing to do with
this. Could you let him go?

01:09:12.245 --> 01:09:13.643
Oh, such altruism.

01:09:13.645 --> 01:09:16.180
Why don't you worry
about yourself, darling?

01:09:16.182 --> 01:09:17.714
You're allowed.

01:09:17.716 --> 01:09:20.618
Now, how do I know

01:09:20.621 --> 01:09:23.254
about the execute-on-sight
order?

01:09:23.256 --> 01:09:24.756
- Does it matter?
- Oh, come on.

01:09:24.759 --> 01:09:27.492
You might find it amusing,
that one tiny

01:09:27.493 --> 01:09:30.028
trivial, fucking phone call
would claim your life.

01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:32.031
You think this is gonna
get you back in?

01:09:32.033 --> 01:09:33.765
I really don't like the way
she drops me all the time.

01:09:33.768 --> 01:09:35.134
I don't wanna go back.

01:09:35.136 --> 01:09:36.768
It's just an outstanding credit

01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:38.439
in my favor bank.

01:09:39.573 --> 01:09:41.240
We can work something else out.

01:09:41.242 --> 01:09:44.309
Oh, don't negotiate.
It's terribly unattractive.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:48.081
Anyhow, uh,
do you remember Crawford?

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:49.816
He called me two days ago

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:53.318
and his daughter, uh,
not Madeleine, but the ugly one

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:56.589
uh, his daughter's applying to
Arizona State for Art History.

01:09:56.591 --> 01:09:58.657
And since my cover
is so good at the museum

01:09:58.659 --> 01:10:00.492
he actually called on her behalf

01:10:00.494 --> 01:10:02.728
to ask me for a letter
of recommendation.

01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:05.598
I agreed out of history
and courtesy.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.438
And just as we were
about to hang up...

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:12.573
he goes,
"How are you holding up?"

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:14.408
I didn't know what
he was referring to.

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:17.811
So I asked him to elaborate.

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:21.448
He says your name, which
prompted me to inquire further

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:24.385
and that's when
he breaks protocol

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:27.253
and tells me
about the EOS order.

01:10:27.255 --> 01:10:28.855
Roughly ten hours after that

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.458
you call me and tell me
you're heading this way.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.430
Imagine my surprise.

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:38.333
Nat... isn't that funny?

01:10:38.335 --> 01:10:40.101
Nat?

01:10:40.103 --> 01:10:43.270
I mean, come on, tell me that
you're least entertained

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:45.008
by this bit of news.

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:50.345
Hide and seek, huh?
In this house? Really?

01:10:50.347 --> 01:10:51.779
It's not a big house.

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:53.248
It's not gonna be
much of a game.

01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:02.026
Nat?

01:11:05.395 --> 01:11:07.064
Where are you, Nat?

01:11:09.166 --> 01:11:11.435
Please don't. It really
brings out the stupid.

01:11:14.772 --> 01:11:17.706
Maybe it's just...

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:20.913
'cause of your Swedish heritage.

01:11:21.881 --> 01:11:24.214
Alright.

01:11:24.216 --> 01:11:27.683
It's just human that
you made it your weapon.

01:11:27.685 --> 01:11:31.957
Allow me to save you the mystery
of its current weight.

01:11:34.325 --> 01:11:37.393
When you were rinsing off,
I removed all the bullets

01:11:37.395 --> 01:11:39.631
and re-inserted an empty clip.

01:11:41.466 --> 01:11:43.869
So what's the next move,
darling, huh?

01:11:44.603 --> 01:11:46.406
How does it go down?

01:11:49.441 --> 01:11:51.677
I hope you didn't shag Hollis.

01:11:53.879 --> 01:11:55.380
I mean, he looks so fragile.

01:11:55.382 --> 01:11:59.184
It's not out of jealousy,
but you know

01:11:59.186 --> 01:12:01.422
can't imagine he'd be any good.

01:12:04.223 --> 01:12:06.558
You know, I mean, I know
that's not what you like

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.929
but maybe what you like
has changed.

01:12:09.931 --> 01:12:12.264
What do you think, huh?

01:12:12.266 --> 01:12:15.737
Come on, Natalie.
I know you're in here.

01:12:20.374 --> 01:12:22.408
It'll be quick, I promise.

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:24.542
Let me grant you that dignity.

01:12:24.544 --> 01:12:26.713
My final gift to you.

01:12:54.675 --> 01:12:56.078
Nat?

01:13:27.811 --> 01:13:30.045
- Oh, God!
- Ugh!

01:15:06.581 --> 01:15:07.679
Come on.

01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:06.742
Hollis?

01:16:07.577 --> 01:16:09.143
- Hollis.
- No, no, no.

01:16:09.145 --> 01:16:10.712
Don't say anything.
Don't talk to me.

01:16:10.714 --> 01:16:12.013
- What are you doing?
- Please stop talking.

01:16:12.015 --> 01:16:13.048
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:14.482
Can you please just talk to me?

01:16:14.484 --> 01:16:16.118
That's the one thing
I just asked!

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:19.554
Okay, fine. Now just-just...
You talk to me. Say something.

01:16:19.556 --> 01:16:21.457
No, I need to leave.
I need to leave right now.

01:16:21.459 --> 01:16:23.991
I am sorry you saw that.

01:16:23.993 --> 01:16:26.695
Sorry I saw,
not sorry you did it?

01:16:26.697 --> 01:16:28.864
He would've killed me.
I had no choice.

01:16:28.866 --> 01:16:30.132
It scares me that you think

01:16:30.134 --> 01:16:31.901
that-that-that
you're wired that way.

01:16:31.903 --> 01:16:33.602
Oh, you know
what I'm capable of doing.

01:16:33.604 --> 01:16:34.704
It's an entirely different thing

01:16:34.706 --> 01:16:37.109
to... see it.

01:16:38.042 --> 01:16:39.509
Yes.

01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:41.678
You loved that man...

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.116
at one point. I assume as much.

01:16:46.184 --> 01:16:47.817
And now, right then, in there

01:16:47.819 --> 01:16:50.620
you, you-you end his life,
just like that.

01:16:50.622 --> 01:16:53.790
I didn't see I had any other
choice at that moment.

01:16:53.792 --> 01:16:56.126
The moment right before
when he was still alive?

01:16:56.128 --> 01:16:57.627
The alternative
would have been me

01:16:57.629 --> 01:16:59.196
lying there in the garage,
not moving.

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:01.098
- Would you have preferred that?
- That's a stupid question.

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:04.103
You came in there with a knife.
What were you gonna do?

01:17:05.504 --> 01:17:06.905
To help you.

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:12.076
- Well, I helped myself first.
- I saw.

01:17:12.078 --> 01:17:14.245
I see that now,
you're good at surviving

01:17:14.247 --> 01:17:16.714
lookin' out for yourself.

01:17:16.716 --> 01:17:18.816
And you.

01:17:18.818 --> 01:17:20.685
- We're gonna make it.
- No.

01:17:20.687 --> 01:17:23.054
I'm done.

01:17:23.056 --> 01:17:25.459
I'm gonna take my chances
out there on my own.

01:17:26.759 --> 01:17:27.792
Don't.

01:17:27.794 --> 01:17:28.827
You're just as dangerous

01:17:28.829 --> 01:17:31.229
as what's out there.

01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:33.234
There's no difference.

01:17:35.035 --> 01:17:37.371
You forced me to trust you.

01:17:38.105 --> 01:17:40.340
Made me feel safe.

01:17:42.608 --> 01:17:44.912
No wonder it's for you.

01:17:48.649 --> 01:17:51.182
Fine.

01:17:51.184 --> 01:17:52.787
Go ahead.

01:17:56.624 --> 01:17:59.226
I'm really sorry
I walked into that park.

01:18:01.996 --> 01:18:04.933
Not as sorry as I am
for taking that picture.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.974
Wait, I'll clean up
and I'll get you some money.

01:18:14.976 --> 01:18:16.412
Yeah.

01:19:51.743 --> 01:19:54.581
Fuck! Company!

01:19:56.683 --> 01:19:58.382
- I think they're here.
- How many?

01:19:58.384 --> 01:20:00.217
- I saw at least two.
- That sounds right.

01:20:00.219 --> 01:20:01.418
Okay, uh, w-what can I do
to help?

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:02.453
Oh, so now you're with me?

01:20:02.455 --> 01:20:04.688
Well, what do you think?

01:20:04.690 --> 01:20:06.957
Not knowing their strategy,
I can't counter.

01:20:06.959 --> 01:20:08.693
Best thing to do would be
to stick with defense.

01:20:08.695 --> 01:20:09.728
Well, me?

01:20:09.730 --> 01:20:10.795
Run or lure them into

01:20:10.797 --> 01:20:12.830
an on-the-fly kill zone.

01:20:12.832 --> 01:20:14.965
Finger off the trigger
until you're ready to shoot.

01:20:14.967 --> 01:20:17.302
Use both hands, aim
and then pull the trigger.

01:20:17.304 --> 01:20:18.335
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:20:20.006 --> 01:20:21.441
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:37.156
So, so what do we do now?

01:20:37.158 --> 01:20:38.424
We'll have to get out of here.

01:20:38.426 --> 01:20:40.358
Puts everyone at risk.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.894
Okay, so what's the plan?

01:20:42.896 --> 01:20:44.229
I've got an idea.

01:20:44.231 --> 01:20:45.764
You've got another light
on you?

01:20:45.766 --> 01:20:47.502
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:21:22.872 --> 01:21:25.973
That should keep them moving
in this direction.

01:21:25.975 --> 01:21:27.307
What, they...
And we want that?

01:21:27.309 --> 01:21:30.345
- Yeah.
- Won't they follow?

01:21:30.347 --> 01:21:34.248
Got no choice, if they go back
to Colombia empty-handed...

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:36.519
it'll get much worse for them.

01:22:01.144 --> 01:22:03.648
It's to our advantage
to control their approach.

01:22:06.082 --> 01:22:08.151
We're gonna have to split up.

01:22:08.153 --> 01:22:10.920
- What? Oh, no.
- You have your gun.

01:22:10.922 --> 01:22:13.857
Just head up to those rocks
over there.

01:22:13.859 --> 01:22:15.991
- I-I can't. I...
- Hollis.

01:22:15.993 --> 01:22:17.695
This is the only way.

01:22:19.498 --> 01:22:21.067
Okay?

01:27:28.552 --> 01:27:30.219
Huh?

01:28:40.928 --> 01:28:42.230
Oh.

01:29:28.444 --> 01:29:29.713
Hollis?

01:29:52.602 --> 01:29:54.137
Are you okay?

01:29:56.472 --> 01:29:58.040
- Yeah.
- Are you hurt?

01:29:58.042 --> 01:30:00.844
- Are you bleeding?
- I'm fine.

01:30:02.812 --> 01:30:04.546
The other one, is she, uh...

01:30:04.548 --> 01:30:06.047
Well, I was the one...

01:30:06.049 --> 01:30:08.219
Hey, it's okay.

01:30:10.487 --> 01:30:12.055
It's fine.

01:30:12.057 --> 01:30:13.792
You're alive.

01:30:15.059 --> 01:30:17.560
It's gonna be fine, okay?

01:30:17.562 --> 01:30:19.197
Come on, let's go.

01:31:01.108 --> 01:31:02.942
Car's all yours.

01:31:03.976 --> 01:31:06.478
- Is it safe now?
- Yeah.

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:07.812
Well, you're welcome
to stay in the house

01:31:07.814 --> 01:31:09.546
for a few hours
if you wanna head out later.

01:31:09.548 --> 01:31:12.319
No. I'll go now.

01:31:13.987 --> 01:31:16.653
Just obey the speed limit.

01:31:16.655 --> 01:31:18.757
I'd hate for the registration
to come out.

01:31:18.759 --> 01:31:20.458
Okay.

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:22.797
Stop the car in a crowded lot,
wipe it clean.

01:31:25.031 --> 01:31:27.565
What about you?

01:31:27.567 --> 01:31:30.702
I'll dispose of Rodney,
I'll... clean the house.

01:31:30.704 --> 01:31:32.104
I'll borrow his car.

01:31:32.106 --> 01:31:34.075
No, I meant after.

01:31:37.043 --> 01:31:40.814
I don't know,
I will disappear, I suppose.

01:31:44.119 --> 01:31:45.955
They won't send more?

01:31:47.089 --> 01:31:50.423
New country, new ID,
new everything.

01:31:50.425 --> 01:31:52.795
Doesn't matter.
No one will find me.

01:31:54.129 --> 01:31:55.898
I don't doubt it.

01:31:59.567 --> 01:32:00.935
Look...

01:32:02.137 --> 01:32:04.372
you, uh, saved my life
back there...

01:32:05.674 --> 01:32:07.411
in the desert, I...

01:32:08.745 --> 01:32:10.279
Thank you.

01:32:13.116 --> 01:32:15.752
Well, I guess
that makes us even then.

01:32:24.093 --> 01:32:27.227
I'm sorry for dragging you
into this.

01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:29.997
Well, you've told me
I'd get through it.

01:32:29.999 --> 01:32:32.270
I wasn't sure when I said it.

01:32:35.171 --> 01:32:37.539
Listen, well...

01:32:37.541 --> 01:32:39.741
well, what I said before about
you being dangerous, I didn't...

01:32:39.743 --> 01:32:42.678
No, it's fine. You were right.

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.214
You were right.

01:32:45.248 --> 01:32:47.051
I'll examine that.

01:32:51.721 --> 01:32:54.557
Drive safe and if, if you feel
yourself getting tired, just...

01:32:54.559 --> 01:32:55.828
Yeah.

01:32:58.762 --> 01:33:01.065
Don't let this stop you
from taking pictures.

01:33:03.068 --> 01:33:05.838
The thought hadn't even
crossed my mind.

01:33:07.204 --> 01:33:08.971
Okay.

01:33:08.973 --> 01:33:10.808
And whatever's next...

01:33:11.842 --> 01:33:13.244
good luck.

01:33:14.078 --> 01:33:15.513
Thank you.
