WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:07.408
Previously on ER:

00:07.441 --> 00:09.610
( screams )

00:09.643 --> 00:11.112
No!

00:11.145 --> 00:13.547
I'm good at the academic
stuff, you know,

00:13.581 --> 00:16.250
but you're good
with everything else.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.651
Maybe we could
help each other.

00:17.685 --> 00:18.752
We're going out to dinner.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.688
You're still coming,
right?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.556
I'd rather not be going out
with someone right now, okay?

00:22.590 --> 00:24.092
You're probably
not his type.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.326
Besides, he's my friend,

00:25.359 --> 00:27.061
not yours.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.191 --> 00:58.426
Hey...

00:59.827 --> 01:01.329
Hey, buddy, wake up.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.796
( groans )

01:02.830 --> 01:04.798
Come on. We got
to get going.

01:04.831 --> 01:08.136
It's Thursday.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.570
It's a late day.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.639
Not for me.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.341
I've got to get to work.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.143
Come on.

01:15.143 --> 01:18.246
Rise from the dead, King Tut.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.321
"17A hydroxylase
deficiency"?

01:27.355 --> 01:28.522
They've got to be kidding.

01:28.556 --> 01:29.357
What number
are you on?

01:29.390 --> 01:30.358
41, you?

01:30.391 --> 01:32.193
Fifty.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.427
What, are you finished?

01:33.461 --> 01:34.828
Yep.
Allergic reaction
in three

01:34.862 --> 01:36.330
needs more benadryl,

01:36.364 --> 01:38.199
and lab lost the urine
for Mr. Perkins.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.667
I'm not on yet.
According to Weaver,
you are.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.834
I'm trying to take a test.

01:40.868 --> 01:41.835
Done!

01:41.869 --> 01:43.371
"Pompe"? "Dupuytrer"?

01:43.404 --> 01:44.738
These are diseases?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.440
That's a hard one.
And no helping.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.209
You guys aren't Googling
each other again, are you?

01:48.242 --> 01:49.377
We're taking our
practice boards.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.844
Save it for study hall.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.813
Abby, your nursing shift
started two minutes ago.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.682
Yeah, I'm almost there.
Hank Benitez:
shortness of breath.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.550
Needs to be vitalled.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.352
Lester, can you grab that
off the printer?
Certainly.

01:58.386 --> 01:59.420
Hi.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.654
I have work in an hour.

02:00.688 --> 02:01.822
I think you better call
your boss.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.191
Morning.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.692
Hey, Michael.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.928
Oh, Gallant, you got a message
from Valerie.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.663
LEWIS:
Valerie, huh?

02:09.697 --> 02:12.500
Flight's at 3:10.
Says she can't wait to see you.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.769
What? She's my sister.

02:15.803 --> 02:16.904
Stop looking at me like that.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.606
Oh, oh, your sister.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.274
Younger or older?
We're twins.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.942
What's she look like?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.611
I don't know.
Picture me in a dress.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.945
You trying to
freak me out?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.514
Once, when I was
in high school,

02:26.547 --> 02:29.450
I had to wear fishnets
and stilettos.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.619
It was for a musical.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.621
Okay. I'd like this conversation
to be over.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.456
Have you ever shaved your legs?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.358
It-it feels funny.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.460
Looks like there's
a memorial for
Romano today.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.928
Poor man.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.630
Yeah. He must've really hurt
a helicopter

02:42.663 --> 02:43.931
in his previous life.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.500
( snickers )

02:46.534 --> 02:49.237
What? Well, just tell
these people about karma.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.638
If you're so concerned
about karma,

02:50.671 --> 02:52.240
I'd stop making jokes
like that.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.941
The memo says Elizabeth
helped organize

02:53.974 --> 02:55.509
the memorial service.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.811
Today at the, uh,
hospital chapel at 2:00.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.248
Somebody should go.

03:00.248 --> 03:03.484
Oh, uh-uh.
Come on, you guys.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.286
Come on. We'll draw straws.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.633
Morning, Dr. Corday.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.968
Morning.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.736
ALEX:
What's that for?

03:22.770 --> 03:24.405
SAM:
It's for the people
who died at the car crash.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.566
HARMS:
Johanna Lambright,
17 years old, passenger,

04:25.599 --> 04:27.034
high-speed MVA with PSI.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.502
Seatbelt, but no airbag,

04:28.536 --> 04:31.739
tachy at 126; BP: 115/72;
resps: 20.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.906
What's your name?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.875
Johanna. Where's Thomas?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.544
Her boyfriend.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.578
He was hurt bad.
You have to help him.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.879
He's right behind us.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.748
Thomas Yoder,
17-year-old driver, MVA,

04:40.781 --> 04:42.350
GSW right chest.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.417
Plus stab wound
to the right flank.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.918
Triple crown. Take him in One.

04:44.952 --> 04:45.986
OLBES:
Needled in the
rig. Sats 84.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.020
Kerry, do you have a minute?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.756
We're good.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.924
I'll be right there.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.460
I was thinking...

04:52.493 --> 04:54.762
um... you and Robert
had a long history--

04:54.795 --> 04:57.097
complicated, I know...

04:57.130 --> 04:58.932
I was wondering, uh,

04:58.966 --> 05:02.370
whether you wouldn't like
to say a few words today.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.938
I'll certainly
try to be there.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.476
It only seems right that one
of you should eulogize him.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.679
Um, he did end his life
working down here.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.783
I'll make sure
we honor that.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.885
LESTER:
Should we intubate?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.520
Decreased
on the right.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.921
Penetrating chest trauma,
hypotension,

05:20.954 --> 05:23.624
hypoxia-- pneumothorax
unless otherwise proven.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.426
I can guess
who aced that test.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.428
Sterile sevens, please.
We haven't scored them yet.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.129
Pulse ox down to 86.
Yeah, we decided
to swap papers

05:29.162 --> 05:30.931
to avoid any cheating.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.400
Ten blade
and a curved kelly.
I don't cheat.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.402
I do.
Susan...

05:34.402 --> 05:35.969
everything all right?

05:36.003 --> 05:38.572
Uh, yeah, great, as soon
as I get this tube in.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.940
32 French.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.642
I was thinking
that one of us should speak

05:41.675 --> 05:42.710
at Robert's memorial...

05:42.743 --> 05:44.077
Yeah, you'd be great.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.078
I was thinking you.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.614
Me...? O silk.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.649
Yeah, why don't you
let me secure that,

05:48.682 --> 05:50.418
go run the board?

05:55.155 --> 05:59.560
And you might want
to start preparing
some remarks.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.430
Johanna?! Is she...
is she hurt?

06:02.430 --> 06:05.666
She's okay.
She's just next door.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.067
Oh, we shouldn't have
been there.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.836
I was waiting in the car.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.672
I heard gunshots,
and then Thomas came running...

06:11.705 --> 06:14.708
and we drove away
as fast as we could.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.844
This cut goes down all the way
through the galea.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.146
Make sure you irrigate
it well and close it
as a separate layer.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.449
Looks like you have a fan.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.854
WEAVER:
Xeroform and
elastoplast.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.188
Occlusive dressing
over the stab wound.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.557
KOVAC:
How's he doing?

06:29.590 --> 06:30.691
LESTER:
Lovely breath sounds.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.125
CT's ready for him.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.694
I've got a few meetings
this morning,

06:33.727 --> 06:35.195
but I'll be on pager
if you need me to cover.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.730
Cover?

06:36.764 --> 06:39.733
Robert was supposed
to be on today.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.471
ABBY:
So I'm grading your paper?

06:43.504 --> 06:44.638
LESTER:
I'm doing Neela's.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.039
She's doing mine.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.608
Could you grade it
before lunchtime?

06:47.641 --> 06:49.510
I'm feeling a
little bit anxious.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.712
Johanna, we're taking your
boyfriend to get some X rays.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.913
What's the plan?

06:52.946 --> 06:54.214
GALLANT:
CT of head and abdomen.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.816
KOVAC:
You sure?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.518
GALLANT:
Well, with the extensive
head lac

06:57.551 --> 06:59.520
and the possibility
of intraperitoneal injuries...

06:59.553 --> 07:01.121
Are you sure?

07:01.154 --> 07:03.223
I know how you feel about tests,
but, yeah, I'm sure.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.092
Good. I completely agree.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.898
( phone ringing )

07:13.266 --> 07:15.569
Forgot to turn it off.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.904
Sorry, it's from London.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.806
Abby, can you
take over for me?

07:21.174 --> 07:23.677
( speaking in Punjabi )

07:23.711 --> 07:25.212
JOHANNA:
What language is that?

07:25.245 --> 07:27.214
Punjabi. She's Indian.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.216
A little bit
of pressure.

07:29.249 --> 07:32.152
Ah. Ah.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.156
No, I said I can't come.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.928
You have a math test.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.262
Maybe it'll be a snow day.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.164
Hit the books, kiddo.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.100
Tough love, huh?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.102
Hey, Frank, will you
post this for me?

07:49.136 --> 07:51.639
Sure. "Microwave:
a hundred bucks?"

07:51.672 --> 07:54.642
KOVAC:
Yeah I need to unload
some of my stuff
before I head back.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.776
LEWIS:
When are you leaving?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.545
KOVAC:
Sometime in January.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.812
Still waiting for the
Alliance to notify me.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.148
LEWIS:
"Bose speakers: 80 bucks,

08:01.181 --> 08:03.551
fish tank: $200,
42-inch plasma screen?"

08:03.551 --> 08:04.952
FRANK:
Why would you
get rid of that?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.555
KOVAC:
Hey, the Congo's
not exactly HD-ready.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.122
LEWIS:
So, how much for the TV?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.024
KOVAC:
Make me an offer.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.965
No school today?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.299
It starts late.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.001
Why is that?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.571
'Cause the teachers
need to talk about us.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.576
What's the matter?

08:28.609 --> 08:30.978
I have wrestling in gym today.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.645
I hate wrestling.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.048
Never much cared
for gym class myself.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.317
What a shocker.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.986
Ankle fracture in sutures

08:39.019 --> 08:40.587
needs reduction and casting.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.089
Guy messed it up pretty good.

08:42.121 --> 08:42.923
Can I come?

08:42.956 --> 08:45.225
No.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.294
There's nothing wrong
with that kid's arm.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.295
It hurts, okay?

08:48.328 --> 08:49.863
I did your ankle.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.331
Now, be a good patient
and go to sleep.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.000
ZIMMER:
Can I at least
get some Valium?

08:53.033 --> 08:56.704
It'd be much easier
to just go to your gym class.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.306
There's a kid there,
Ernie Kendrick.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.141
We call him Osama.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.943
He hits hard.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.646
If your mom sees this,
we're both dead, you know that?

09:07.748 --> 09:11.351
I'll wait in the
lounge till I need
to catch my bus.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.820
So...

09:12.853 --> 09:14.287
you're going
back to Africa?

09:14.321 --> 09:16.023
Yep.
For how long?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.124
Not sure.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.358
Is it a vacation?

09:18.391 --> 09:20.160
No, it's work.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.361
What kind of work?

09:21.394 --> 09:23.230
Like I do here.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.198
Isn't it really gross?

09:25.232 --> 09:28.068
Aren't there, like, a lot
of sick people there?

09:28.101 --> 09:30.370
That's why they need doctors.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.305
You went there before?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.174
A few months ago.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.743
Did you ever see a lion?

09:36.744 --> 09:40.247
How 'bout a hyena?

09:40.280 --> 09:42.883
Sounds like Africa
kind of sucks.
Dr. Kovac,

09:42.916 --> 09:45.653
I need you to
sign off a dispo.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.387
I thought you weren't
presenting to me.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.389
I got over it.
What do you have?

09:49.422 --> 09:52.059
72-year-old guy with
three weeks of cough
and tactile temps.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.061
Z-Pack, home,
follow-up with PMD.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.929
KOVAC:
You can't send home
an elderly patient

09:55.963 --> 09:58.231
with three weeks
of fever and cough
without a chest film.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.067
PRATT:
I knew I should've waited
on Lewis.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.869
SAM:
Excuse me, coming through.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.904
Got a guy rolling in
with four severed digits.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.205
Genius tried to cut
through some ice

10:05.238 --> 10:07.040
with a chainsaw.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.275
KOVAC:
Looks like they've
got it covered.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.342
Sam, I need ten of morphine.
Got it.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.178
( screaming )

10:11.211 --> 10:12.980
Try rock salt next time.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.849
You got the fingers?
Right here, big
Slurpee special.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.651
What's up
with shorty's wrist?

10:17.685 --> 10:19.887
My mom twisted it
when she was drunk.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.689
Lounge. Go.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.225
( screaming )

10:25.258 --> 10:27.194
Full trauma panel,
order a hand series

10:27.227 --> 10:30.898
and page the
replantation service.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.233
We just wanted to try some pot,
that's all.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.803
You went to the South Side
to score drugs?

10:35.836 --> 10:39.439
We heard that was
the place to go.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.109
So, you're from India?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.678
My family lives
in London now.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.880
Chicago's as far
as I've ever gotten.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.750
How long have you and Thomas
been dating?

10:49.783 --> 10:53.053
Um, a year, but we
grew up together.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.455
Our families live on
the same road in Arcola.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.691
It's about three
hours from here.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.292
When did you move
to Chicago?

10:59.326 --> 11:01.461
We've only been
here a few weeks...

11:01.494 --> 11:03.797
just, you know,
hanging out.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.298
Your boyfriend got lucky.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.734
The bullet collapsed a lung

11:06.734 --> 11:08.135
but didn't hit
anything critical.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.470
THOMAS:
The bad news is my leg's broken.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.740
You can handle that.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.407
Yeah, but they're going
to admit me.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.309
Oh, that's only for a few days,
till your chest tube comes out.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.879
In the meantime, we'll need
to phone your parents.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.749
Uh, my folks don't
have a phone.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.884
His either.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.853
Is there somebody else
we can call?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.387
The Fishers.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.789
No, Thomas.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.192
You don't have
to call anybody.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.261
Uh, actually, we do.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.295
You're both minors.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.830
Talk to our folks, Jo.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.366
We just need to be more careful.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.804
THOMAS:
I'll give you a
neighbor's number.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.340
ABBY:
Ten cc's of lidocaine.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.209
Hand surgeon's
on his way down.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.178
Let's update his tetanus
and give three grams of Unasyn.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.013
You two going
to Robert's memorial?

11:53.046 --> 11:55.015
Uh, yeah.
Sure.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.516
Did he have any family?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.351
Not that I'm aware of.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.187
Another 3-0 vicryl.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.190
Median and ulnar blocked.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.492
Is that Sam's little boy?

12:05.525 --> 12:07.394
Should you be here?

12:07.427 --> 12:08.829
SAM:
Dori, toss me that
bag of saline.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.199
No. Bye.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.201
Got you a Zerowet
for irrigation.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.202
Hand/ortho down yet?

12:15.235 --> 12:16.503
Still waiting.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.205
I hope Alex wasn't
in your way.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.807
Nope, no, not at all.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.208
He's just curious.
Okay.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.409
Old man with belly pain--

12:22.442 --> 12:24.377
do you start
with LFTs or CT?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.213
Hypotensive?
I think so.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.016
Back pain?
( gasps ):
Aortic dissection.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.851
Where is this patient?

12:30.884 --> 12:32.219
No, it was a practice test.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.954
I totally blew it.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.089
It's my understanding
we're in good shape--

12:36.123 --> 12:39.392
nice clean amputation
just distal to the MCP.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.829
Well, we'll be taking you
up right away, Mr., uh...

12:41.829 --> 12:43.230
Kohler,

12:43.263 --> 12:46.499
and we... only recovered
three fingers?

12:46.533 --> 12:47.567
CORDAY:
No, no,

12:47.600 --> 12:49.002
no, there are...

12:49.036 --> 12:51.304
three.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.506
There were four a minute ago.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.408
YORK:
Well, there are three now,
so either we lost one,

12:55.442 --> 12:58.846
or a finger thief made off
with an intact middle digit.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.148
Excuse me.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.987
SAM:
Alex!

13:07.020 --> 13:08.889
Alex!

13:08.922 --> 13:10.357
Get the hell back here!

13:11.491 --> 13:12.592
Don't screw
around with me.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.863
Empty the backpack.

13:15.896 --> 13:16.563
Where is it?

13:16.596 --> 13:17.965
What?

13:17.998 --> 13:18.966
You know what
I'm talking about.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.133
No, I don't.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.368
The paramedics
brought in a guy

13:21.401 --> 13:23.003
with four
viable fingers,

13:23.036 --> 13:24.171
three of which are
still sitting on ice.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.006
Maybe a dog ate it.
Alex.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.575
What finger did you lose?

13:28.608 --> 13:30.443
Ring any bells?

13:32.645 --> 13:36.283
I got to catch my bus.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.052
Did I say you
could have this?

13:39.086 --> 13:41.889
No.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.257
Don't I always get you
whatever I can?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.026
Yeah.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.361
Then why do you steal stuff?

13:49.930 --> 13:51.899
Come on, Alex. This is serious.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.266
Where is it?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.601
I don't know.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.505
What's in
your pocket?

13:58.538 --> 14:00.507
KOVAC:
How long ago was the injury?

14:00.540 --> 14:01.909
There's still time.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.610
Abby, can you help me with this?

14:03.643 --> 14:05.913
This is really above
and beyond, isn't it?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.547
You know, I was thinking

14:07.580 --> 14:09.182
you'd be a good person
to say something.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.450
Say something?

14:10.483 --> 14:11.952
You know, at this thing
for Romano.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.520
Oh, you're
kidding, right?

14:13.553 --> 14:16.289
No. I think it would be nice
coming from a nurse.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.525
TAGGART:
Dr. Kovac?

14:21.995 --> 14:24.564
Tell me you did not put a splint
on my kid's arm.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.399
I'm sorry, but we are busy

14:26.433 --> 14:28.268
trying to find a man's finger
right now.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.636
Yeah, and the reason
it's missing is because

14:29.669 --> 14:31.338
instead of studying here
like I told him,

14:31.371 --> 14:32.339
he's off with you
playing doctor.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.306
What?!

14:33.340 --> 14:34.507
Not like that.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.343
He's getting beat up at school.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.045
I-I-I-I I was just...

14:38.078 --> 14:39.512
Oh, what, he told you
his Osama Kendrick,

14:39.546 --> 14:41.048
evil wrestler's
story?

14:41.081 --> 14:42.315
Please. He
made it up.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.417
He makes lots of stuff up.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.321
I'm sorry. I'll take it off.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.522
No.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.958
You stay away from him, okay?

14:50.991 --> 14:52.092
LEWIS:
If the kid

14:52.125 --> 14:53.326
took the finger,
we need him

14:53.360 --> 14:54.527
to tell us
where it is.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.229
( sighs )

14:56.263 --> 14:58.331
He won't tell me.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.409
Alex?

15:09.442 --> 15:11.478
It's in the refrigerator

15:11.511 --> 15:13.480
in the lounge.
What?!

15:13.513 --> 15:15.082
I put it there
because I know

15:15.115 --> 15:16.383
it needs to
stay cold.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.417
In the fridge
or the freezer?

15:17.450 --> 15:18.585
Fridge.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.120
Behind the juice.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.354
You give it up to him
just like that

15:21.388 --> 15:22.422
after stonewalling me?

15:22.455 --> 15:23.690
Well, he
asked nicer.

15:23.723 --> 15:24.992
That's it.
Mom...

15:25.025 --> 15:25.993
Get on that bus
right now.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.327
Stop it!

15:27.360 --> 15:28.695
I'll speak to you later.
Leave me alone.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.330
Oh, we'll have
a talk later.
Stop...

15:30.363 --> 15:32.332
You're a real Mr. Rogers,
you know that?

15:32.365 --> 15:33.633
Hey, five- to
six-year-old girl,

15:33.666 --> 15:35.235
brady with a rate
of 32, no BP.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.004
GCS 3, severe hypothermia.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.671
I couldn't get a line in.
She's too clamped down.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.173
What's her name?

15:40.207 --> 15:41.308
Jane Doe, history unknown.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.375
Found her down
in the bushes

15:42.409 --> 15:43.643
in Lincoln Park.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.078
Any idea how long
she was out there?

15:45.112 --> 15:46.546
Too long.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.148
PRATT:
Warm blankets,
warm saline.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.282
Let's get a bear-hugger
in here right now.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.218
She's like ice.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.652
All right, let's get ready
to tube her. Abby, you do it.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.521
I'm not on my med student
rotation today.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.489
Okay, so you're a nurse
who intubates.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.027
Okay.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.261
Miller 2
and a 5-5.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.330
Anything in her pockets?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.597
No keys, no coins,
nothing.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.399
HALEH:
Rate 38 on the monitor.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.235
Faint pulse,
one cc of epi.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.736
Don't have a line.
IO won't flush.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.271
Try the other side.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.672
Any identifying marks?

16:12.705 --> 16:14.307
Not that I could see.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.575
All right, come on,
pick it up, Abby.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.743
We'll give meds
through the ET tube.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.645
Rectal temp: 86.7.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.147
We need those
blankets in here.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.782
I'll go.
Cricoid pressure.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.717
Where did that cop go?

16:24.751 --> 16:26.053
He's calling missing persons.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.355
I'm in.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.223
PRATT:
Bright yellow.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.391
Good job, Abby.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.062
Somebody's got
to be looking for her.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.765
Yes, County General in Chicago.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.333
They're both here.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.501
Mm-hmm.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.203
Neela Rasgotra.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.238
Thank you.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.240
So, is somebody coming for them?

16:47.274 --> 16:49.209
He said he'd notify
their parents,

16:49.242 --> 16:51.311
but he wasn't sure how soon
they'd be able to hire a car.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.579
What was your call about?

16:52.612 --> 16:53.746
In the trauma room?

16:53.780 --> 16:55.648
Oh, my sister and her husband

16:55.682 --> 16:57.684
in Chandigarh have had a baby.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.119
Oh, congratulations.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.553
You're an aunt.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.622
There's a Sikh ritual--
a naming ceremony.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.691
My parents want me to go
to India with them

17:04.723 --> 17:06.093
so I can be there for it.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.394
You don't want to go?

17:07.426 --> 17:09.296
I can't just take
two weeks off.

17:09.329 --> 17:12.265
Anyway, guilt calls are just
their way of keeping me close.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.833
( laughs )

17:13.866 --> 17:15.734
Well, you know, it's nice
to know that they miss you.

17:15.768 --> 17:19.672
Yeah, and at times, suffocating.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.342
They don't understand
that, uh, doctor thing, huh?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.843
They run a restaurant
in South Hall.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.744
I'm the first professional
in the family,

17:25.778 --> 17:28.115
the first to live anywhere
other than India or London.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.616
On the one hand,
they're very proud.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.584
On the other,
it scares the hell out of them.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.253
How are you feeling, Thomas?

17:33.286 --> 17:35.122
Like I have a tube
in my chest.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.689
I spoke to Mr. Fisher.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.591
He said he'd pass the word
on to your families.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.726
They'll make
us go home.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.695
Are you runaways?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.564
You wouldn't believe it
if we told you.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.732
Thomas, shut up.

17:45.765 --> 17:46.766
Try me.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.401
We're Amish.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.170
Know what that is?

17:50.203 --> 17:51.471
It's a religion.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.740
It's a good one.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.543
It's all about taking care
of each other,

17:56.576 --> 17:58.278
protecting each other.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.746
And living separate
from the outside world.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.214
So, you did run away?

18:01.248 --> 18:04.184
We're on rumspringa.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.452
When you get
to be 16,

18:05.485 --> 18:06.753
you can do
whatever you want

18:06.786 --> 18:08.188
for a while,
experience stuff.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.622
At the end of it,
you have to decide

18:09.656 --> 18:11.558
whether you want to be
in the community or not.

18:11.591 --> 18:15.228
A little dose of teen rebellion
so you won't be tempted later?

18:15.262 --> 18:17.864
After it's over,
you'll be a good Amish.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.234
She's in V tach.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.369
Charge to 60.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.836
What do you have?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.672
Jane Doe found down in park.
Hypothermic.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.774
We gave two rounds of epi,
only access is IO. Clear.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.209
( zaps )

18:29.242 --> 18:30.210
Still V tach.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.344
PRATT:
Up to 120.

18:31.378 --> 18:32.412
How long was she out there?

18:32.445 --> 18:33.646
We don't know.
Clear.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.781
( zaps, beeps )

18:34.814 --> 18:35.915
Got a pulse.
Rate's 67.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.650
Pratt, get a
central line kit

18:37.684 --> 18:39.286
and throw
in a femoral.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.787
Couldn't find any
missing persons reports

18:40.820 --> 18:42.789
in the last three days
matching her description.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.457
Abby, prep for a peritoneal

18:44.491 --> 18:45.658
and pleural
lavage.
So now what?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.360
They're going back,

18:47.394 --> 18:48.628
checking old reports,
one week at a time.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.796
Let's hear a BP
and a repeat temp.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.631
Maybe she's from
another state.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.500
We could check
with Amber Alert.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.601
Yeah, we'll get
in touch with
other agencies

18:54.634 --> 18:55.668
if we don't turn
up anything.

18:55.702 --> 18:56.769
How's she doing?

18:56.803 --> 18:57.870
PRATT:
She's still here.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.206
KOVAC:
Get a DPL kit

18:59.239 --> 19:00.207
and chest
tube tray.

19:00.207 --> 19:00.940
And more blankets.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.209
Come on. Let's go.

19:16.856 --> 19:20.227
( laughter )

19:32.839 --> 19:35.242
MAN:
I think the police
are handling this
in the right way.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.776
Somebody threw
her away.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.778
Well, maybe the parents
are in trouble.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.313
Maybe they're sick
or injured.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.614
Or maybe she's
a foster kid

19:41.648 --> 19:43.250
that got
passed around

19:43.283 --> 19:44.651
from place to place
to place to place

19:44.684 --> 19:46.553
until her case worker
just loses track of her,

19:46.586 --> 19:47.820
and she falls
through the cracks.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.589
Yeah, that's
possible.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.492
So, check the CPS foster files,
the federal database.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.793
Abby, I want to help,

19:53.826 --> 19:54.961
but there's not
much I can do

19:54.994 --> 19:56.696
without a name
or an ID.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.665
Well, there must be pictures
of these kids somewhere.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.899
Not that I
have access to.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.701
Ken, come on.
You're a smart guy.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.503
Get access.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.372
Yeah, before we go snooping
around in the foster system,

20:05.405 --> 20:07.240
let's just explore our
more likely options:

20:07.274 --> 20:08.741
that she was ditched
by her parents

20:08.775 --> 20:10.243
or abducted by relatives

20:10.277 --> 20:11.244
or maybe she's
even a runaway.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.912
Oh, she's six years old!

20:15.382 --> 20:16.516
Okay.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.017
I'll get a
fingerprint card,

20:18.050 --> 20:20.787
and I'll see what strings
I can pull over at CPS.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.255
Thank you.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.629
( loud whirring )

20:40.740 --> 20:42.241
( sighs )

20:51.851 --> 20:54.354
Fourth one I've ever smoked,
and already it's getting old.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.922
Your mom's on her way.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.859
I love my family.

20:59.892 --> 21:00.993
I-I love where I'm from.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.695
But until this past year,

21:02.729 --> 21:04.531
the coolest thing that
ever happened to me

21:04.564 --> 21:06.733
was placing second in
the annual cheese festival.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.934
Congratulations.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.536
( chuckles )

21:09.569 --> 21:11.671
She'll want me to go back.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.874
She'll, um, see this
as a sign from God.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.843
It's up to you,
isn't it?

21:16.876 --> 21:18.511
It's not so easy.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.880
If you choose
not to be Amish,

21:20.913 --> 21:22.482
you're shunned.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.884
The community turns
its back on you.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.554
Even your family?

21:27.587 --> 21:28.688
Everyone.

21:31.991 --> 21:35.362
See, out here...

21:35.395 --> 21:37.964
it-it's scary,
but it feels

21:37.997 --> 21:41.401
full of possibilities.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.802
How can I go back there

21:42.835 --> 21:44.404
and pretend that
this doesn't exist?

21:44.437 --> 21:45.705
How does Thomas
feel about it?

21:45.738 --> 21:46.906
Mm.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.007
He's had enough.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.577
He wants to go home.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.546
Do you love him?

21:59.519 --> 22:02.755
What would you do?

22:02.789 --> 22:06.459
I may not be the best person
to advise.

22:06.493 --> 22:09.061
I'm a Chicago medical student
of Punjabi extraction

22:09.095 --> 22:10.930
by way of London, England.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.499
A bit of a mess, really.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.937
If I were you...

22:17.970 --> 22:20.407
I'd go home.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.776
LEWIS:
I'm concerned
that your chest pain

22:23.810 --> 22:25.912
may be something serious
called a pulmonary embolism.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.013
What's that?

22:27.046 --> 22:28.581
A blood clot
in the lungs.

22:28.615 --> 22:29.916
So, I'm going
to send you up to radiology

22:29.949 --> 22:30.950
for a test called
a pulmonary angiogram.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.118
More x-rays?

22:32.151 --> 22:33.520
I know, Mr. Benitez.
I'm sorry.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.554
This is the last time.
I promise.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.489
I sure hope so.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.024
Oh, could you take Mrs. Benitez
and her son to the family room?

22:38.057 --> 22:39.125
Mm-hmm.
Come with me, ma'am.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.427
See you later, Dad.

22:40.427 --> 22:41.928
Order a pizza, amigo.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.730
I'm hungry.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.432
So, if this angio thing
is positive, then what?

22:45.432 --> 22:47.099
They would confirm
he has an embolism,

22:47.133 --> 22:48.901
at which point
we'll stop the clot

22:48.935 --> 22:50.437
with a drug
called heparin.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.104
I'll let you know
when he comes back down.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.473
You can wait in here.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.007
Thank you.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.910
You sent that guy up for
a pulmonary angiogram?

22:57.944 --> 23:00.747
Dr. Lewis wanted to be sure
before heparinizing.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.014
What's your opinion?

23:02.048 --> 23:04.016
I'm not sure my
opinion matters.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.818
SAM:
Luka, you
got a minute?

23:05.852 --> 23:08.655
If you don't think it matters,
then it doesn't.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.022
I took a half-shift.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.591
I've got to get
home before Alex.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.760
I'm sorry about
the splint.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.562
Look...

23:15.595 --> 23:17.764
I appreciate you trying
to be his friend.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.032
I just don't want
things to get weird.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.569
You're a good
guy, I'm sure,

23:22.602 --> 23:24.671
but you don't know crap
about raising kids,

23:24.704 --> 23:26.506
so, thanks for the help,

23:26.539 --> 23:28.007
but no thanks.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.009
I got it covered.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.612
Okay.

23:34.814 --> 23:37.116
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.021
Abby, where's Lewis?

23:42.054 --> 23:43.490
Exam Three.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.024
Do we have premixed
heparin drips?

23:45.057 --> 23:47.059
I'll check drug lockup.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.062
Hey, so the police found
a couple from Rogers Park.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.864
Their four-year-old
daughter disappeared

23:51.898 --> 23:53.165
from a shopping mall
two years ago,

23:53.199 --> 23:54.233
hasn't been seen since.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.568
The profile matches up.

23:55.602 --> 23:56.903
She's been missing
that long?

23:56.936 --> 23:58.004
Yeah, they're
bringing them in.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.540
I just wanted you to know.

24:00.573 --> 24:01.941
Thank you.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.576
I got a page my sister
was down here.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.011
Frank took her
to the lounge.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.145
You guys
meeting us later?

24:06.178 --> 24:07.514
Definitely.

24:07.547 --> 24:08.548
Abby? Neela?

24:08.581 --> 24:10.016
Soon as my shift's over.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.017
I'll try.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.119
See you there.

24:15.622 --> 24:18.124
I believe my daughter
Johanna is here.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.192
She's with a boy
named Thomas.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.694
I'm the one
who left the message.

24:21.728 --> 24:22.862
How was your trip, ma'am?

24:22.895 --> 24:24.063
Fine, thank you.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.197
KOVAC:
You're losing time, Susan.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.866
I can take you to see them.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.768
LEWIS:
Heparinization's not
a benign therapy.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.570
Neither is
all this testing.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.572
He has a history of
GI bleeding from ulcers.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.106
But a high probability
of pulmonary embolism,

24:34.140 --> 24:36.075
and by the time it takes you
to wait for radiology,

24:36.108 --> 24:38.044
you're going to end up
with a much bigger problem.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.746
Or I could give
him heparin now,

24:39.779 --> 24:41.681
and if it's not PE,
he'll be puking blood

24:41.714 --> 24:45.284
from taking a dangerous
drug he didn't need.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.919
The next time you feel
like discussing my orders

24:46.953 --> 24:48.588
with another doctor,
don't talk to Kovac.

24:48.621 --> 24:52.625
No, I...

24:52.659 --> 24:54.126
WOMAN:
Both families agreed

24:54.160 --> 24:56.863
it's time for you
to come home

24:56.896 --> 25:00.633
so that you can be baptized
and married.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.969
I thought that we get
to decide when.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.137
You got yourselves in trouble.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.973
You could've been killed.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.141
I know you're mature enough

25:09.175 --> 25:12.579
to see that this isn't
the life for you.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.615
Is everything all right?

25:15.648 --> 25:17.083
The Amish lady's
working on them.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.585
Who, the religious cultists?

25:18.618 --> 25:20.219
It's not a cult.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.621
More like a club.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.923
Oh. Hey.

25:23.956 --> 25:24.924
Here you go.

25:24.957 --> 25:25.925
How did I do?

25:25.958 --> 25:27.226
Oh, pretty good.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.260
Ninety seven...!

25:28.294 --> 25:29.629
Yep.
...per cent.

25:29.662 --> 25:30.930
What?

25:30.963 --> 25:32.732
Um, Neela.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.705
So?

25:38.738 --> 25:41.273
Not bad. Uh, 93%.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.242
Sorry, I haven't
finished yours yet.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.844
I'll find you
when I'm done.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.851
Hey.
Hey.

25:53.653 --> 25:54.754
Mm.

25:55.688 --> 25:56.789
It's so good to see you.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.190
Hey, Val, listen,
I'm sorry.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.126
I got hung up
with a patient upstairs and...

26:00.159 --> 26:01.293
It's okay.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.962
My plane got in early.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.697
So, everything went fine?

26:04.731 --> 26:07.266
Yeah, you know, crappy flight,
but it's all good.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.968
It's all good.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.770
Hey, listen, I was thinking,
after my shift,

26:10.803 --> 26:12.805
that we'd go over to this place,
Ike's, down the street

26:12.839 --> 26:13.806
and catch some dinner?

26:13.840 --> 26:14.974
Great.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.643
Hey, Mike.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.310
Kinsey in Four
is waiting on a wound check

26:18.344 --> 26:20.212
and a doggy bag of Percocet.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.782
And why am I the last one
to hear that your sister's hot?

26:22.815 --> 26:25.051
I'm sure he's got his reasons.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.722
I'm sorry.
I didn't see you sitting there.

26:29.756 --> 26:32.992
I'm Dr. Greg Pratt,
your brother's mentor.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.894
( scoffs ):
Yeah, right.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.063
Pleased to meet you, Dr. Pratt.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.265
No, call me Greg, Valerie.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.701
Call me Val, Gregory.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.169
( chuckles )

26:43.202 --> 26:45.738
Okay, hey, I'm all over
this Kinsey thing.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.173
Uh, is there anything else?

26:47.206 --> 26:48.975
Uh, yeah, in fact, uh,

26:49.008 --> 26:50.777
I was thinking
about heading over
to Ike's after work,

26:50.810 --> 26:52.378
you know,
play some pool,

26:52.411 --> 26:54.146
get some drinks.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.247
I was wondering if you
two would like to go?

26:55.281 --> 26:56.783
Actually, we were planning

26:56.816 --> 26:58.217
on getting some dinner there
already.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.986
What a coincidence.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.354
Well, I actually spread
the word around a little bit.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.856
Really? It didn't
get to me.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.091
Hm.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.926
It all works out then.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.294
Great.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.796
Look forward to
seeing you later.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.799
( Pratt sighs )

27:14.233 --> 27:16.769
He'll need to stay
upstairs for a few days.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.038
Is there a phone I can use?

27:19.071 --> 27:21.340
That's okay?
You can do that?

27:21.373 --> 27:23.175
We don't hate technology.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.911
We just don't allow it
to take over our lives.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.779
There'll be a phone in
his room you can use.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.882
I'll be back down
once I have him settled.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.417
What's up with
the pilgrims?

27:31.450 --> 27:34.721
Thomas is going back to Arcola
once he's recovered.

27:34.754 --> 27:35.755
And Johanna?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.223
She's thinking it over.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.228
Abby, this is Larry
and Judith Anderson.

27:42.261 --> 27:45.064
You the nurse who's
been working on Kendra?

27:45.097 --> 27:47.066
Kendra. Yes, I am.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.768
JUDITH:
Can we see her?

27:48.801 --> 27:50.336
Yeah. Kendra
hasn't spoken yet.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.839
We'll have a better idea
of how she's doing

27:52.872 --> 27:54.741
once her temperature
comes up.

27:54.774 --> 27:55.942
ER.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.810
That the Jane Doe girl's
parents?

27:57.844 --> 27:59.812
Guess she's not
a Jane Doe anymore.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.782
Hold. Dr. Lewis, do you have
a patient up in angiography?

28:02.815 --> 28:04.383
Uh, yeah, Hank Benitez.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.318
He's crashing.

28:10.156 --> 28:12.258
Lost his pressure after
the first dye injection.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.761
He's in PEA.
Had an amp of epi.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.395
Okay, let's tube him.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.797
He's got urticaria.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.431
Must've thrown
a big clot.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.768
Probably an anaphylactic
reaction to the dye.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.169
Benadryl and steroids?

28:24.470 --> 28:26.105
He should have been heparinized.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.274
He has classic signs
of an allergic reaction.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.341
What does this look
like to you, Neela?

28:29.375 --> 28:30.442
Hives? I'm not certain.

28:30.476 --> 28:31.477
( alarm beeping )

28:31.510 --> 28:32.378
V tach.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.947
Charge to 200.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.354
Last BP was 78/44.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.791
Best we've had so far.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.363
LARRY:
Oh, no.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.265
Oh, God, no.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.401
It's okay.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.203
I think she's going to be fine.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.038
It's her. It's her.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.207
No, honey, it's not.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.541
Well, it could be.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.210
It's not, Judith.
It's not.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.545
Maybe she just changed,
you know?

29:06.578 --> 29:10.883
Maybe she's different.
No, Judith. Judith. No.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.384
This is not our daughter.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.386
( Judith sobbing )

29:29.936 --> 29:31.137
LEWIS:
Hold compressions.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.238
Still V-fib.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.840
Clear.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.241
Asystole.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.009
It's been
45 minutes.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.210
Okay, I'm calling it.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.846
Time of death: 7:08.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.447
One shot of heparin
could have prevented this.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.514
That's crap, Luka.

29:42.548 --> 29:43.983
He was killed by

29:44.016 --> 29:45.351
an anaphylactic
reaction to the dye.

29:45.384 --> 29:46.485
He's dead because
of an unnecessary test.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.020
Please stop.

29:48.054 --> 29:49.856
It's not about PE,

29:49.889 --> 29:51.223
and it's not about anaphylaxis.

29:51.257 --> 29:54.526
It's about this man.

29:54.560 --> 29:58.530
I'll go and inform his family
that they've lost him.

30:07.539 --> 30:08.841
Hey.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.443
I heard.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.045
Yeah.

30:13.079 --> 30:14.146
Listen, a woman I know
over at CPS

30:14.180 --> 30:15.614
has been letting me go through

30:15.647 --> 30:17.449
the past five years
of foster care records,

30:17.483 --> 30:19.585
but I haven't been able
to come up with anything yet.

30:19.618 --> 30:22.188
A little girl disappears
and nobody notices?

30:22.221 --> 30:23.856
I'll keep looking.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.391
Thanks.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.627
I've had enough.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.897
You want to go
get a drink with Gallant?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.598
Oh, I thought
I'd hang around

30:32.631 --> 30:34.466
and make sure she
gets up to the PICU.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.869
Can't a nurse do that?

30:36.903 --> 30:38.504
I am a nurse.

30:38.537 --> 30:41.107
And you're a med student.

30:51.217 --> 30:54.921
Hey. You guys
headed over to Ike's?

30:54.954 --> 30:57.223
Yeah. Gallant's sister's
in town. He's buying.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.591
So I hear.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.560
I'll, uh, catch up.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.136
Johanna?

31:15.975 --> 31:20.012
Tell Thomas
I said to get better.

31:21.647 --> 31:24.951
Thank you, Doctor.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.692
Abschied.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.628
Gott mit dich.

31:42.634 --> 31:46.038
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Lambright.

31:46.072 --> 31:48.474
She's the oldest.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.443
I have six
other children.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.979
They were so happy

31:52.979 --> 31:56.148
when I told them
she was coming home.

31:56.182 --> 31:59.218
She's a good
girl, ma'am.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.987
She'll be all right.

32:04.323 --> 32:07.159
You can't make them stay
if they don't want to.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.568
Someone will be back for Thomas
when he's better.

32:20.639 --> 32:23.609
Hey, Stern is ready to be DC'd
soon as the UA's back.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.011
Kovac is here.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.178
Hey, Kovac, it's Sam.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.414
Her son is MIA.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.648
Sam?

32:29.681 --> 32:32.318
What?

32:32.351 --> 32:34.286
No, hey, listen,
just calm down.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.022
How long ago?

32:36.022 --> 32:37.089
Hey, Kovac.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.224
( sighs )

32:38.257 --> 32:40.292
Uh, no, no, I haven't.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.360
Just relax.

32:41.393 --> 32:44.163
Kovac!

32:44.196 --> 32:45.264
He's here.

32:56.675 --> 33:00.346
How was school?

33:00.379 --> 33:02.681
I had to go to gym.

33:02.714 --> 33:07.586
I got pinned by some kid
in, like, ten seconds.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.655
I don't think
you should go back to Africa.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.157
No?

33:11.190 --> 33:13.559
I heard it's dangerous.

33:16.362 --> 33:17.729
Your mom's worried about you.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.098
She's a loser.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.299
Hey.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.767
She does a lot.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.172
Is that why
we're always moving around?

33:26.205 --> 33:28.240
Leaving places
as soon as I've got friends?

33:28.274 --> 33:30.309
She does what she needs
to take care of you.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.645
She wishes she never had me.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.319
( chuckling )

33:46.758 --> 33:50.096
Mike. I see
you got here before me.

33:50.096 --> 33:51.463
You guys met
my sister, Val?

33:51.497 --> 33:52.631
Frank introduced us.

33:52.664 --> 33:53.765
Neela and Abby, right?

33:53.799 --> 33:55.234
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

33:55.267 --> 33:55.834
How long are
you in Chicago?

33:55.867 --> 33:57.436
A month.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.439
I teach special
needs kids in DC.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.308
I'm taking a seminar
at Northwestern.

34:02.341 --> 34:03.542
Very nice.

34:03.575 --> 34:04.410
You guys going
to stay for a while?

34:04.443 --> 34:05.744
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.179
I'll be back
in a minute.

34:08.214 --> 34:10.248
So, uh, Mike never told me

34:10.282 --> 34:12.717
that your mother
was so beautiful.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.120
Our mother?

34:14.152 --> 34:15.521
Yeah, well, she'd have to be

34:15.554 --> 34:17.456
to have a daughter like you,
right?

34:17.489 --> 34:18.857
VAL:
Don't hold back, Greg.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.391
Drink?

34:20.426 --> 34:21.627
I'm with you.

34:26.465 --> 34:27.733
Do you think it's bad

34:27.766 --> 34:29.801
I'm not going home
to the Punjab?

34:29.835 --> 34:32.571
Personally, I
never miss a Sikh
naming ceremony,

34:32.603 --> 34:34.505
but that's just me.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.775
They're going to choose
a name for my niece.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.577
They don't
even need me there.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.212
Do you have nieces
or nephews?

34:40.246 --> 34:41.313
My brother's single.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.380
Where is he?

34:42.414 --> 34:43.449
Minnesota.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.284
Do you see him much?

34:45.317 --> 34:47.253
Not now, no.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.487
I'm trying to let him
get his stuff together

34:49.521 --> 34:51.223
while I get my stuff together.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.658
Me, too.

34:52.690 --> 34:56.295
I'm trying to get
my stuff together, too.

34:56.328 --> 34:59.431
Let's all of us
get our stuff together.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.835
Do you miss them-- your family?

35:03.869 --> 35:05.171
Sure.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.673
Me, too.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.742
Did you ever get around
to scoring my test?

35:12.511 --> 35:17.283
Uh... yeah. Here.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.591
52?

35:25.624 --> 35:28.327
I got a 52%?

35:28.360 --> 35:30.529
Think of it as half full.

35:41.940 --> 35:46.645
I'm sorry I wasn't there,
Elizabeth.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.847
You weren't the only one.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.554
He had nothing but this place,
Kerry.

35:55.587 --> 35:56.755
No wife, no kids.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.328
Everything he ever had,
he lost here.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.897
At the end of a life,

36:05.931 --> 36:07.566
you'd think
there'd be more to say.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.502
He'll be missed.

36:10.536 --> 36:13.239
Whether we realize it or not.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.414
You got pissed off
at Kovac and Lewis?

36:55.447 --> 36:56.582
I didn't mean to.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.317
Oh, so,
what did they do?

36:58.350 --> 36:59.985
They just looked at me
like they couldn't believe it.

37:00.018 --> 37:01.953
Like, "You? You're
not supposed to get angry."

37:01.987 --> 37:03.489
What's happening
to our little girl?

37:03.522 --> 37:05.291
Yes, that's how it always is.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.958
Except there's different
versions of it, isn't there?

37:06.992 --> 37:08.494
What's she talking about?

37:08.527 --> 37:09.995
I have no idea,
but she's on a roll.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.630
"Oh, she's a
sweet Indian girl.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.998
Poor thing
probably grew up

37:13.031 --> 37:14.633
begging for scraps
in Calcutta."

37:14.666 --> 37:15.967
You mean you didn't?

37:16.001 --> 37:17.769
I've never even been
to Calcutta.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.705
Or, "She's the

37:19.738 --> 37:22.341
"well-educated British girl--
proper, soft-spoken and docile."

37:22.374 --> 37:24.009
With a very good vocabulary.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.011
I'm not--
not any of those things.

37:26.044 --> 37:29.381
I'm not Indian. I'm not British.
I'm not American.

37:29.415 --> 37:30.816
So, what the hell are you?

37:30.849 --> 37:32.884
Yeah, well, that's the question,
isn't it?

37:32.918 --> 37:34.586
Do you ever feel

37:34.620 --> 37:36.988
like you don't know
who the hell you are?

37:37.022 --> 37:39.991
No. But I'm very well-adjusted.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.527
You about ready to go?

37:41.560 --> 37:44.029
Yeah.

37:44.062 --> 37:45.797
Thanks, everybody.
It's been fun.

37:45.831 --> 37:50.336
Sorry. I've completely
monopolized the intercourse.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.438
Yeah, I think it's about time
for me to go, too.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.340
I'll walk out
with you guys.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.841
Discourse.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.709
GALLANT:
Do you want me to get your chair
from the car?

37:57.743 --> 37:58.844
No, I'll be fine.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.379
I'll use the sticks.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.016
I need a little
help sometimes.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.721
Do you have a cigarette?

38:09.755 --> 38:11.022
No.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.424
Thank God.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.895
The car's
just around the corner.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.063
I'm a little tired.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.498
Can you pull it around?

38:19.531 --> 38:20.966
You want me to go get it?

38:20.999 --> 38:22.534
Yeah, do you mind?

38:22.568 --> 38:24.570
Michael-- get
the car, okay?

38:24.603 --> 38:26.605
Yeah, be right back.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.845
Hope I didn't come off
sounding too insensitive.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.982
You know, I'm just doing me,
talking my crap.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.050
I, I didn't realize...

38:39.084 --> 38:41.720
What, how easy it
is for me to get a
seat on the subway?

38:41.753 --> 38:42.888
You flirted, Greg.

38:42.921 --> 38:43.955
I flirted back.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.657
I know.

38:45.691 --> 38:48.394
I still think I sounded
kind of whack because...

38:48.394 --> 38:50.529
Greg, I was diagnosed
with MS when I was 22,

38:50.562 --> 38:52.631
and before that, I
was a normal girl.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.566
Very normal.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.934
I didn't grow
up limited,

38:55.967 --> 38:57.703
so I don't think
of myself that way.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.408
How advanced is it?

39:02.441 --> 39:08.447
I have a couple relapses a year,
but I'm still fully functional.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.549
How's that for a pickup line?

39:10.582 --> 39:12.651
( chuckling )

39:14.586 --> 39:16.455
Don't get me wrong, okay?

39:16.488 --> 39:17.556
You, you look good--

39:17.589 --> 39:20.726
very good.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.594
But, you know, I just
don't want to complicate...

39:22.628 --> 39:24.763
It's not
killing me.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.433
At least not anytime soon.

39:27.433 --> 39:29.668
So, I'm just getting on
with things.

39:37.175 --> 39:38.710
Get ready for bed.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.812
I'll be back in a minute.

39:40.846 --> 39:44.616
Don't ever do that
to me again.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.685
Brush your teeth.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.925
Is he okay?

39:53.959 --> 39:55.761
Silent treatment.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.829
He'll be fine tomorrow.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.932
I didn't mean
to be a bitch before.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.067
You weren't.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.502
You know, I don't worry

40:03.535 --> 40:04.970
about not having a man
in my life,

40:05.003 --> 40:06.905
but... maybe he needs one.

40:06.938 --> 40:10.208
Maybe I'm not paying
enough attention to that.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.643
Better no man than
the wrong one.

40:11.677 --> 40:13.044
Yeah, his father

40:13.078 --> 40:17.749
wasn't much of a father...
or anything else.

40:17.783 --> 40:20.519
But he had a truck
and a pierced tongue

40:20.552 --> 40:23.188
and an endless stash of weed.

40:23.221 --> 40:25.924
I was 15 years old.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.532
So, you and Alex
grew up together.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.901
Oh, I'm a good big sister,

40:35.934 --> 40:39.605
but I'm not always sure
how great a mom I am.

40:39.638 --> 40:42.107
Parents always worry about that.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.876
I just see him sitting in some
shrink's office in ten years

40:44.910 --> 40:47.012
talking about what a job
his mother did on him.

40:47.045 --> 40:50.549
Kids are resilient.

40:55.687 --> 40:59.224
Look, I know I said
I didn't need any help...

40:59.257 --> 41:03.662
but... tonight I did.

41:03.695 --> 41:06.532
So, thanks
for the help.

41:18.276 --> 41:19.645
See you tomorrow.

41:19.678 --> 41:20.746
Yeah.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.581
I appreciate it.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.154
KOVAC:
Good night.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.256
Just one more stick.

41:31.289 --> 41:33.258
No pain here?

41:33.291 --> 41:35.561
How about here?

41:41.833 --> 41:44.002
Dr. Weaver.

41:47.072 --> 41:48.574
It's okay, sweetie.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.042
Haleh, airway
box and bag mask.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.711
I know, I know.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.212
You don't need that

41:54.245 --> 41:57.015
to help you breathe
anymore, do you?

41:57.048 --> 41:59.585
Ready when you are.

42:01.186 --> 42:02.821
I want you to cough,

42:02.854 --> 42:04.590
and then I'm going
to pull this tube out.

42:04.623 --> 42:05.824
On three, cough for me.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.326
Ready?
One, two, three.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.962
Good. Good girl,
good girl, good girl.

42:10.996 --> 42:12.598
There we go.

42:16.034 --> 42:19.871
All right.

42:19.905 --> 42:22.307
Clear breath sounds.

42:22.340 --> 42:23.609
Sats look good.

42:25.276 --> 42:26.978
It's okay, honey.

42:27.012 --> 42:29.981
You're in a hospital.

42:30.015 --> 42:31.316
What's your name?

42:31.349 --> 42:33.318
Can you tell us
your name?

42:33.351 --> 42:35.754
Dr. Weaver,

42:35.787 --> 42:37.322
LOL in Three's
coughing up blood.

42:37.355 --> 42:38.824
( sighing )

42:38.857 --> 42:41.627
Uh, Haleh, check an ABG
on 14 liters.

42:50.669 --> 42:52.303
Amanda.

43:21.132 --> 43:23.935
I love you, kiddo.

43:23.969 --> 43:26.104
More than anything.

43:27.305 --> 43:33.250
