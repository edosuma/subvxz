00:02.040 --> 00:03.963
ROY: <i>Hands where I can see 'em.</i>
DEAN: Is that you, Roy?

00:04.160 --> 00:05.571
<i>Which makes you Walt.</i>

00:08.840 --> 00:10.285
SAM: <i>Jody Mills is good people.</i>

00:10.440 --> 00:12.807
<i>And she'll give you a place to crash
until you get back on your feet.</i>

00:12.960 --> 00:15.167
If only you'd been as ruthless as I hoped.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.925
- So now what?
- Let's begin.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.327
MR. KETCH: <i>I do have to
hand it to Lady Bevell.</i>

00:19.480 --> 00:21.926
<i>Your treatment's been most successful.</i>

00:28.440 --> 00:30.124
- Stay where you are.
- Hey!

00:30.280 --> 00:32.203
- I was talking to you.
- Mom?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.281
I really wouldn't move.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.124
<i>She will shoot you.</i>

00:36.400 --> 00:38.448
- Where do you think you're going?
- Ketch?

00:38.640 --> 00:40.961
Your bunker is an excellent fortress.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.645
An even better tomb.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.326
<i>We've re-jiggered the locks,
we've shut off the water,</i>

00:45.520 --> 00:49.411
and once we leave, the pumps
that bring in the air shall reverse.

00:49.560 --> 00:54.122
Your oxygen should be gone in
two days, maybe three.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.401
Come along, Mary.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.646
No!

02:17.880 --> 02:19.803
All right. The garage?

02:19.960 --> 02:22.725
Doors are warded,
and the walls are reinforced steel.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.645
Okay, um, you know, maybe we can
go out through the air vents.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.006
TONI: <i>You wouldn't get far.</i>

02:27.160 --> 02:30.403
There are choke points in the duct system
not even I could squeeze through.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.800
I say we kill her.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.561
I mean, you heard Ketch.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.564
He said we had about three days
of air left, so if we ice her,

02:36.760 --> 02:39.206
- maybe that buys us an extra day.
- I assure you, Dean,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.249
I'm an extraordinarily shallow breather.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.370
- Yeah, right.
- If we ever get out of here,

02:44.640 --> 02:46.449
I am the one who programmed your mother,

02:46.640 --> 02:48.881
which means that
I am the only one who can undo it.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.801
And since I assume you want Mummy back,

02:52.800 --> 02:54.006
you need me.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.920
You believe her?

02:58.280 --> 03:00.931
I don't know. Look, if she's lying,
sure, we take her out.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.610
But Mom's still out there, brainwashed.

03:02.840 --> 03:06.561
If she's telling the truth,
then we do need her.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.169
All right, you're so smart,
how do we get out of here?

03:09.320 --> 03:11.209
The only way out
is to pull the manual override.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.010
- Is that a thing?
- Oh, it is.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.131
But it's outside the bunker,
where we can't reach it.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.327
Awesome.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.326
Wait a second, guys.

03:20.480 --> 03:25.202
We're in a giant vault loaded down
with occult books and lore.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.170
There's got to be something somewhere
in here, an item or a spell.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.561
Some hoodoo
that can reverse the lockdown.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.971
SAM: <i>I think I got something.</i>

03:40.680 --> 03:42.842
"When the Romani people were forced
to assimilate in Europe,"

03:43.000 --> 03:44.729
"the Roma used a spell,"

03:45.040 --> 03:48.362
"the Abrogation ritual, as an act of
rebellion against their persecutors."

03:48.520 --> 03:52.286
"The Devla turns back
complex mechanical processes,"

03:52.440 --> 03:53.805
"resets equipment, machinery."

03:54.000 --> 03:55.081
What's it take?

03:55.240 --> 03:58.369
Seem like pretty basic ingredients,
nothing we don't already have.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.331
- Oh.
- What?

04:00.480 --> 04:03.689
"The mechanisms must be anointed
with the blood of virgins."

04:07.600 --> 04:09.329
Not even close.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.842
All right, well,
then I guess we keep looking.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.003
- Or we fake it.
- Excuse me?

04:15.240 --> 04:16.286
SAM: <i>We fake it.</i>

04:16.480 --> 04:20.279
I mean, I've read half a dozen
purification rituals in the last hour.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.007
If we used one of those on our blood...

04:23.200 --> 04:25.567
- It'd what, re-virginize it?
- Maybe.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.371
TONI: <i>So, we purify the blood,</i>

04:27.520 --> 04:28.760
then do the spell.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.045
Two-step, hybrid magic.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.644
All right, that's step one.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.211
Step two. You're up.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.561
It's working!

05:03.240 --> 05:04.401
It's working!

05:15.240 --> 05:16.287
No.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.727
- No.
- What happened?

05:19.920 --> 05:22.321
Ketch. He knew we'd...

05:22.640 --> 05:24.051
He must have put some kind of

05:24.200 --> 05:26.487
mystical dampener
on the bunker's lockdown.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.490
Magic won't work.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.765
DEAN: Okay, we have

05:36.280 --> 05:39.204
exhausted brains, so I say we try brawn.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.401
How?

05:40.720 --> 05:41.767
Walls.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.410
Now the garage, the Crow's Nest,

05:43.560 --> 05:45.289
these are all reinforced
steel walls, right?

05:45.600 --> 05:47.921
But right here,
that's nothing but concrete.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.366
Right there,

05:49.520 --> 05:51.807
that's an old sewer pipe goes
straight up to the surface

05:51.960 --> 05:53.166
to the override.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.444
So, wait a second. We're just gonna...

05:55.600 --> 05:56.965
Straight Shawshank this bitch.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.891
- Goggles?
- Goggles.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.366
Yeah.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.762
on, yeah.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.928
- We earned a break.
- Yeah.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.600
We'll get there.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.321
No.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.851
No, we won't.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.209
We're not gonna hit dirt
for three days.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.531
Two if we're lucky.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.007
I know you feel it, the air, it's thin.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.285
And it's getting thinner.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.010
How did this happen?

07:15.400 --> 07:16.686
What part?

07:17.880 --> 07:19.041
All of it.

07:20.840 --> 07:21.921
Yeah.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.725
You know, wasn't long ago,
I thought we had it made.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.411
<i>We'd saved the world.</i>

07:30.640 --> 07:33.086
We got Cass back, we got Mom back.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.923
I mean, it wasn't perfect,
but, still, we had 'em.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.121
And now...

07:41.640 --> 07:42.880
Now they're all gone.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.127
<i>And Mom,</i>

07:47.720 --> 07:49.210
what they did to her.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.207
I just fell
for their company line. Man, I...

08:00.560 --> 08:02.801
<i>I saw what they were doing and I...
And I thought,</i>

08:03.000 --> 08:06.607
hunters, on that scale, working together,

08:07.480 --> 08:09.403
how much good we can do.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.571
And once I was in,

08:18.320 --> 08:19.765
I just followed.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.760
'Cause it was easy.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.561
Easier.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.610
Easier than what?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.805
Easier than leading.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.366
Is this how you pictured it? The end?

08:47.440 --> 08:49.010
No, you know it's not.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.322
<i>I always thought we'd go out, like,</i>

08:53.800 --> 08:55.404
Butch and Sundance-style.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.241
Yeah.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.882
- Blaze of glory.
- Blaze of glory.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.365
Son of a bitch.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.331
You're lunatics.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.924
This is a colossally stupid idea.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.806
Yep.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.962
Big, beautiful and dumb.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.602
I've had this thing for so long, been
waiting for the perfect moment to use it.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.205
The explosion could kill us all.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.089
You could bring
the whole bloody place crashing down.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.571
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.449
TONI: You're lunatics.

09:32.960 --> 09:38.046
Action-movie-loving, cheeseburger-eating,
moronic American lunatics.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.765
Okay, beautiful.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.810
Yippee-ki-yay, mother...

10:00.520 --> 10:01.521
Dean?

10:03.880 --> 10:04.881
Dean!

10:27.720 --> 10:28.721
Dean!

11:14.080 --> 11:15.366
Hey, lunatic.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.081
Mary?

11:31.280 --> 11:32.441
Hey, Jody.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.290
Uh...

11:34.600 --> 11:35.761
You got a sec?

11:39.640 --> 11:40.846
Yeah.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.526
SAM: <i>Dead.</i>

11:45.120 --> 11:46.281
Uh, dead.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.643
Wait, I got one.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.805
Garth! Hey.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.169
Ah, man, it's good to hear your voice.

11:58.360 --> 12:02.570
Listen, uh, those Brits I told you about,
they've got a hit on American hunters.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.765
I'm guessing that goes double
for werewolf hunters, so...

12:06.040 --> 12:07.326
No, I don't have time to explain.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.404
You and Bess need to get
someplace safe, okay?

12:11.480 --> 12:12.891
- All right.
- SAM: Hey.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.241
Jody.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.007
DEAN: <i>Jody?</i>

12:27.880 --> 12:29.006
Jody.

12:29.800 --> 12:30.847
- Alex.
- Hey.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.764
Hey. Where is she?

12:39.400 --> 12:40.845
Hello, boys.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.765
JODY: <i>When she clocked me out of the blue,
I thought she was a demon.</i>

12:44.920 --> 12:47.491
Had no idea that brainwashing
could be so thorough.

12:47.640 --> 12:48.926
<i>Jody, she...</i>

12:50.080 --> 12:51.445
I'm so sorry.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.840
It's not your fault.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.720
<i>Fortunately, Alex came home.</i>

12:54.880 --> 12:58.168
All I did was buy you time.
You knocked her out.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.887
I'll get you something for the pain.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.200
Make it a double.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.047
MARY: Aw.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.442
You want to play mother to my son?

13:17.440 --> 13:18.771
He's all yours.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.481
JODY: Dean,

13:22.560 --> 13:23.891
that's not your mom.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.685
MARY: <i>What's the matter, Dean?</i>

13:25.840 --> 13:27.683
Am I too different from the Mary you know?

13:31.560 --> 13:33.050
Or too much the same.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.726
SAM: <i>Here she is.</i>

13:37.240 --> 13:38.321
Do your thing.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.450
All right, you said you could fix her,
so fix her.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.081
I, um...

13:43.560 --> 13:45.005
- Well, I...
- She lied.

13:45.480 --> 13:46.561
What?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.085
Mary's programming,

13:49.960 --> 13:51.246
it's permanent.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.526
- But you said...
- You were going to kill me.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.801
The Mary that you know, the good Mary,

14:00.480 --> 14:04.326
she's hiding behind
impenetrable psychic walls.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.404
And I'm afraid, these walls...

14:10.520 --> 14:12.921
Well, they can't be torn down
with grenades.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.449
Your mother can't be saved.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.243
All right, lady, time's up.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.131
- We only kept you alive for one reason.
- SAM: <i>Hey, you guys.</i>

14:29.360 --> 14:32.921
Listen, Ketch keeps calling Mom's phone.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.241
I'll get it.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.851
Let it go to voicemail.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.127
Let's take a nice little short walk
to the backyard.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.123
This is not going to stop.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.330
Soon enough,
they'll find out you're alive, and then...

14:48.120 --> 14:51.727
- Well, if you want my advice, run.
- We're not running.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.885
Well, then you die.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.243
- Or...
- Or what?

14:59.800 --> 15:01.131
Or we fight.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.649
Feet off the table, Jerry.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.881
Thanks.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.324
That should be the last of 'em.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.450
Walt. Roy.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.681
Well, damn.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.171
- We haven't seen you guys since...
- Since you killed us.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.646
No hard feelings.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.242
Uh, please, get comfortable.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.721
DEAN: Sure about this?

15:39.520 --> 15:42.205
You're gonna tell us
what we're doing here, or what?

15:42.720 --> 15:45.041
Of course. Yeah. Um...

15:45.240 --> 15:47.322
So, my brother and I, we...

15:52.560 --> 15:54.688
No, you know what?

15:55.720 --> 15:59.122
I called you here because people,

15:59.560 --> 16:00.641
um,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.924
our people, are being slaughtered.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.406
And we're next.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.403
<i>The British Men of Letters,
they came here,</i>

16:10.560 --> 16:13.086
because they thought they could do our job
better than we could.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.851
And they hooked us
with their flashy gear and their tech.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.241
<i>Most of you had the good sense
to turn them down.</i>

16:19.560 --> 16:20.721
I didn't.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.081
They said they wanted
the same thing we wanted.

16:26.240 --> 16:30.564
You know, a world free of monsters.
That's not what they really wanted.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.451
<i>They want control.</i>

16:34.080 --> 16:36.924
<i>They want to live in a world where
they can sit in some office, and decide</i>

16:37.160 --> 16:39.049
who gets to live, and who gets to die.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.249
And they've killed people.
They've killed innocent people.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.643
Just because they got in the way.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.087
They think the ends justify the means,
but we know better.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.926
We know hunting isn't just about killing,

16:53.280 --> 16:54.611
it's about doing what's right.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.451
<i>Even when it's hard.</i>

16:57.240 --> 16:58.605
<i>So, we go by our gut, right?</i>

16:58.760 --> 17:01.286
We play by our own rules
and that scares them.

17:02.160 --> 17:05.403
That's why they want us dead, 'cause
we're the one thing they can't control.

17:05.599 --> 17:06.964
So, what do you want from us?

17:09.960 --> 17:11.450
I want you to follow me.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.165
Take the fight to them.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.047
To hit them before they hit us.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.205
We go in fast and hard and we fight

17:21.040 --> 17:25.967
and we beat them down until they
give up or until they're dead.

17:29.120 --> 17:33.091
Look, they're well-trained and well-armed.
Some of us might not make it back.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.040
But we will win.

17:35.600 --> 17:39.321
We will take down the bad guys
because that's what we do.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.529
They're scared of us. Yeah. Good.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.040
They should be.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.724
JODY: <i>You know where we're going?</i>
SAM: <i>Yep.</i>

18:06.680 --> 18:08.250
Gear up. We roll out in 10.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.046
- SAM: You ready?
- Ooh, oh, no. I'm not going.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.487
- What?
- No, my leg busted up the way it is,

18:13.640 --> 18:14.926
I'm no good in a fight.

18:15.080 --> 18:20.007
I'll take a jacked up Dean Winchester
over any 10 other hunters any day.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.326
Yeah.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.205
I saw you.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.766
You're ready for this.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.362
You show those sons of bitches who's boss.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.964
What about you? What are you gonna do?

18:35.640 --> 18:37.005
I'm gonna save Mom.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.925
Look, if she's in there,

18:44.360 --> 18:46.727
if our real mom is in there somewhere,

18:47.920 --> 18:50.571
then I'm gonna try and find her,
bring her back.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.722
- Okay, Donna's...
- Waiting for me at a safe house.

18:56.880 --> 19:00.566
I should drive straight there, no stops.
And you'll call me when this is all over.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.404
I got it.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.647
And, Jody...

19:03.880 --> 19:05.405
I'll be careful. I promise.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.084
Not what I was gonna ask.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.290
Kick it in the ass.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.600
You got this.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.001
Come here.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.326
- You come back.
- I promise.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.961
Bitch.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.444
- Jerk.
- Yeah.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.406
Okay, you got inside
my mom's head once before.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.040
- What about me? You get me in?
- TONI: <i>You? I...</i>

19:51.560 --> 19:54.291
Perhaps. But I need my rig.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.442
- Where is it?
- At the base.

19:58.560 --> 20:04.283
But I suppose with the right materials,
I could cobble something together.

20:06.240 --> 20:12.691
Target lists will be distributed shortly.
In Phase Two, there are no restrictions.

20:13.920 --> 20:19.051
Family members, bystanders.
Don't leave witnesses.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.771
That will be all.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.642
Paige, I need you to pull up
the location of one of our assets,

20:38.840 --> 20:40.649
and I need you to keep it between us.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.411
- Who?
- Mary Winchester.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.928
She's in...

20:55.680 --> 20:57.284
Lebanon, Kansas.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.043
All right,
where's the stuff you need?

21:06.240 --> 21:08.561
Should be in storage, next to the dungeon.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.847
Ah...

21:10.120 --> 21:11.724
Think I'm letting you out of my sight?

21:12.520 --> 21:15.569
Need I remind you that my
organization left me to die?

21:16.360 --> 21:19.045
At this point, I'm not on anyone's
side but my own.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.042
So, I help you try to save your mother,

21:23.200 --> 21:25.089
and when the dust clears...

21:26.200 --> 21:27.884
What? I let you go?

21:28.480 --> 21:30.369
I'd like to see my son again.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.610
I'm not asking for a pass.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.729
I'm asking for a head start.

22:05.520 --> 22:09.570
These electrodes sync your Delta waves
with Mary's, forming a psychic link.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.490
But to enter her psyche

22:11.680 --> 22:15.082
will take a certain measure
of concentration and skill.

22:15.720 --> 22:16.767
And as there's no time to teach you

22:16.920 --> 22:19.730
how to reach the necessary
therapeutic dream state,

22:20.000 --> 22:21.729
I'm banking on this.

22:23.560 --> 22:27.281
Hypnotic agents
laced with a potent sedative.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.601
<i>It's enough to knock
an elephant on its trunk.</i>

22:43.680 --> 22:46.968
- Really?
- Little insurance. You understand.

22:47.920 --> 22:51.003
This will hurt. You understand.

24:25.440 --> 24:26.965
Sam.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.527
Are you awake? It's nap time.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.244
Dean, lunch is ready.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.566
DEAN: Mom.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.841
We gotta get out of here, okay?

25:03.240 --> 25:04.810
You need to come with me.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.000
Mom?

25:08.960 --> 25:10.041
Mom.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.081
Mom.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.601
<i>Mom!</i>

25:47.120 --> 25:49.805
- What is happening out there?
- Perimeter's breached.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.006
Hunters.

25:54.680 --> 25:58.651
Gentlemen, ladies, you know what to do.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.684
Look, I know that they messed
with your head, okay?

26:15.880 --> 26:18.360
I know it feels better in here.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.849
It feels safer. But I need you to hear me.

26:24.360 --> 26:27.409
I was thinking maybe we should take
Sammy to the park later,

26:27.600 --> 26:30.251
before Daddy gets home. Sound good?

26:31.440 --> 26:32.885
Mom, look at me.

26:40.840 --> 26:41.841
You're choosing this.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.525
Your favorite.

26:44.440 --> 26:47.330
- Yes!
- After you eat.

26:55.560 --> 27:00.691
I only want good things for you, Dean.
I'll never let anything bad happen to you.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.530
I hate you.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.805
SAM: Go, go, go...

27:37.240 --> 27:38.765
SAM: Go! Hurry! Hurry!

28:18.600 --> 28:19.806
You lied to me.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.326
I was a kid.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.761
You promised you'd keep me safe.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.921
And then you make a deal with Azazel.

28:35.920 --> 28:39.322
<i>Yeah, it saved Dad's life, but I'll tell
you something else that happened.</i>

28:39.800 --> 28:42.770
Because on November 2, 1983,

28:43.280 --> 28:47.524
old Yellow Eyes
came waltzing in to Sammy's room

28:48.240 --> 28:49.730
because of your deal.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.365
You left us.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.001
Alone.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.322
'Cause Dad was just a shell.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.441
<i>His perfect wife? Gone.</i>

29:12.720 --> 29:17.681
Our perfect Mom,
the perfect family was gone.

29:19.360 --> 29:20.850
And I...

29:23.240 --> 29:24.844
I had to be

29:26.800 --> 29:29.246
more than just a brother.
I had to be a father

29:29.400 --> 29:31.687
and I had to be a mother,

29:33.160 --> 29:34.764
to keep him safe.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.249
And that wasn't fair.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.845
And I couldn't do it.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.010
And you want to know what that was like?

29:52.240 --> 29:54.402
They killed the girl that he loved.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.761
He got possessed by Lucifer.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.968
They tortured him in Hell.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.809
And he lost his soul.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.006
His soul.

30:15.520 --> 30:16.726
All because of you.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.127
All of it was because of you.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.651
I hate you.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.601
I hate you.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.090
And I love you.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.802
'Cause I can't... I can't help it.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.445
You're my mom.

31:21.120 --> 31:23.566
And I understand,

31:25.840 --> 31:28.491
'cause I have made deals
to save the ones I love

31:30.120 --> 31:31.485
<i>more than once.</i>

31:33.880 --> 31:35.291
I forgive you.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.965
I forgive you.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.320
For all of it.

31:49.480 --> 31:50.720
Everything.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.128
On the other side of this,

31:58.160 --> 32:01.004
we can start over, okay?

32:01.280 --> 32:03.760
You, me, Sam.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.169
We can get it right this time.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.369
But I need you to fight.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.004
Right now, I need you to fight.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.521
I need you...
I need you to look at me, Mom.

32:14.680 --> 32:17.570
I need you to really look at me
and see me.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.208
Mom, I need you to see me.

32:27.640 --> 32:28.880
Please.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.041
Dean?

32:48.200 --> 32:49.326
Mom.

33:04.800 --> 33:07.121
- No.
- Oh, yes.

33:32.760 --> 33:37.607
Oh, what? Thought you'd get your mum back?
Sorry, Dean. Not how this ends.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.604
This ends with me ending you.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.610
I wanna kill you.

33:45.120 --> 33:48.966
You won't, but I'd very much
enjoy it if you tried.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.801
You want to know what your mother
said about you, Dean?

34:06.480 --> 34:12.931
All those long days and even
longer nights out on the road, hunting?

34:13.320 --> 34:14.481
Hmm?

34:15.880 --> 34:17.803
Absolutely nothing.

34:23.159 --> 34:24.491
This is fun.

34:42.239 --> 34:43.685
- I got this.
- SAM: Yeah.

35:09.320 --> 35:12.483
When you left us alone in the bunker,
man, I knew you were psycho,

35:12.640 --> 35:15.211
but I didn't think
you were stupid.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.687
I may be many things,

35:19.360 --> 35:21.931
but I'm not stupid.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.523
- Mom?
- Mary.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.401
I knew you were a killer.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.445
You both are.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.845
You're right.

36:27.680 --> 36:31.810
Whatever it takes, open a portal.
Just get me the hell out of here.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.122
MAN: <i>I'm afraid
we don't have the resources</i>

36:35.280 --> 36:37.123
<i>for an extraction at this moment.</i>

36:40.680 --> 36:42.170
SAM: Don't! Don't.

36:46.800 --> 36:51.647
- Listen, Dean.
- It's Sam. And you must be Hess, I trust.

36:52.880 --> 36:56.965
You're in charge of this whole operation?
Or, what's left of it?

36:58.320 --> 37:01.961
Sam, you might think it in your
best interest to kill me,

37:02.120 --> 37:03.804
to end all of this here.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.487
- Hmm.
- But shooting me now,

37:06.640 --> 37:09.166
severing all ties
with the British Men of Letters,

37:09.320 --> 37:12.688
at this particular moment,
that would be a grievous mistake.

37:12.840 --> 37:16.367
- I doubt it.
- There are reasons to reconsider.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.802
Things that you don't know.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.967
- What are these?
- Lucifer is back.

37:41.640 --> 37:45.361
Yes, Sam.
All thanks to your good friend Crowley.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.449
Not that it did him much good.
Crowley's dead.

37:52.520 --> 37:56.764
And the Devil is out looking for his son,

37:57.280 --> 38:02.650
following in its mother's footsteps,
tracking her and your friend, the angel.

38:06.080 --> 38:10.927
If Lucifer gets his hands on that child,
they'll be unstoppable.

38:12.120 --> 38:15.841
You can't face that alone. You need us.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.050
MAN: <i>Listen to her, boy.</i>

38:34.320 --> 38:35.560
Pass.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.563
You bastard.

39:22.520 --> 39:27.970
Found some expired prescription
painkillers, so... Lucky me.

39:29.440 --> 39:32.011
Mom, you don't have to do that.
It's not your job.

39:34.040 --> 39:38.568
This, all of this is because of me.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.645
It's gonna be okay.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.170
It's not okay.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.251
Since I've been back,

39:57.800 --> 40:01.282
I know I've been distant.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.005
Cold, even.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.451
Leaving you,

40:09.520 --> 40:10.965
working with them,

40:14.240 --> 40:16.163
I was trying to make things right.

40:18.840 --> 40:24.927
Just from a distance,
because being here with you

40:26.680 --> 40:28.125
<i>was too hard.</i>

40:30.000 --> 40:31.490
<i>Seeing what I'd done</i>

40:32.400 --> 40:35.404
to you and to Sam, I...

40:36.160 --> 40:38.367
Mom, what you did,

40:39.320 --> 40:40.401
the deal,

40:42.880 --> 40:48.046
everything that's happened since
has made us who we are.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.250
<i>And who we are?</i>

40:53.440 --> 40:54.885
We kick ass.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.285
We save the world.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.046
And Sam?

41:07.840 --> 41:09.205
I'm scared.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.529
What if he can't forgive me?

41:16.920 --> 41:18.001
Mom.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.083
You don't have to be scared of me.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.090
Glad you're back, man.
