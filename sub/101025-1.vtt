(LIGHT OMINOUS MUSIC)

01:33.167 --> 01:38.005
NARRATOR: Long long ago,
when the nights were still dark,

01:38.038 --> 01:41.876
the world was ruled by the
creatures of the night.

01:41.910 --> 01:47.015
Vampires, werewolves, evil
fairies, witches, trolls

01:48.482 --> 01:52.587
and many other monsters spread
fear and terror among people.

01:53.755 --> 01:56.057
But the centuries passed
and the evil creatures

01:56.091 --> 01:58.060
changed over time.

01:59.494 --> 02:04.032
The once terrifying monsters
became peace loving creatures

02:04.065 --> 02:07.036
who no longer wanted
to frighten people.

02:08.769 --> 02:11.773
Some of these magical
beings have lived among us

02:11.806 --> 02:14.842
and undetected since then.

02:14.876 --> 02:18.813
Others have withdrawn to secret
places all over the world

02:18.847 --> 02:22.518
that only can be reached
through magical forests.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.856
The story of the young
vampire, Vlad Tepes,

02:28.889 --> 02:33.095
starts right here when he
leaves our world with his father

02:33.127 --> 02:34.964
and sets off for Crailsfelden.

02:41.936 --> 02:44.505
Invited by the mayor personally,

02:44.538 --> 02:48.143
Vlad is supposed to attend
an elite school famous

02:48.175 --> 02:50.812
among mythical creatures.

02:50.846 --> 02:53.749
But neither Vlad nor
his father suspect

02:53.781 --> 02:57.752
that they have long since
become part of a diabolical plan

02:57.786 --> 03:00.688
to plunge the world
into darkness again.

03:04.158 --> 03:06.027
And where is Crailsfelden now?

03:07.628 --> 03:09.597
We've been driving through
this forest for hours.

52:37.763 --> 52:39.065
Find him!

52:41.600 --> 52:43.069
I need the fragment.

52:49.741 --> 52:50.576
One moment.

52:51.944 --> 52:53.746

52:53.779 --> 52:54.647
No witch-fi.

53:01.619 --> 53:05.056
There he is, with two
other snotty brats.

53:55.706 --> 54:00.145
He wants to go back in

54:00.177 --> 54:03.715
all werewolves, and all
other creatures of the night

54:03.748 --> 54:07.219

out the last page.

ago that nobody found out

54:33.244 --> 54:36.080
too much from that damn book.

54:36.114 --> 54:37.081
Then everything is fine.

54:37.114 --> 54:38.283
Nothing is fine!

Lucifer will do something

to make all of the
magical creatures evil.

55:10.815 --> 55:12.083
But what?

But what, there's
no 13th hour.

55:14.786 --> 55:17.923
Well apparently,
and then he will turn

55:17.956 --> 55:21.327
all Crailsfelden residents
back into monsters

55:21.360 --> 55:22.929

Ms. Cercemeyer, the assistant
to Lord Mayor Ziffer

56:53.018 --> 56:57.389
was here earlier, and she is
quite willing to pay a nice sum

56:57.422 --> 56:59.692
for your blood fragment there.

Okay, that's great!

you say anything,

57:04.362 --> 57:05.764
I know it means a lot to you.

It is after all a memory
of your mother but...

Did you just say great?

Yeah!

you see it the same way.

Yes, sure.

57:31.223 --> 57:32.791

We can always talk
about anything.

telling you how I feel.

really, really nice woman.

And doesn't she
have a lovely nose.

57:43.435 --> 57:45.471
Vladdy, wouldn't you like
to meet her sometime?

57:45.503 --> 57:47.371
For sure, I have
absolutely nothing else

57:47.404 --> 57:48.306
going on right now.

57:48.339 --> 57:49.941
Oh, I'm happy to hear that.

57:49.975 --> 57:52.877
Vladdy, how about tomorrow
morning in front of the school.

57:52.911 --> 57:54.480
You could accompany
me to the town hall

57:54.513 --> 57:56.281
when I want to sell
her the blood fragment.

57:56.313 --> 57:58.250
Wouldn't you like
to give it to me now

57:58.282 --> 57:59.384
then I can polish it a little,

57:59.417 --> 58:01.219
put it in a nice
jewelry box with a bow.

58:01.252 --> 58:02.420
Sounds good.

same when I was a teenager,

58:24.141 --> 58:26.043
Guys, you won't believe
what just happened.

58:26.076 --> 58:29.413
Let me guess, you wanted
to warn your father.

58:29.447 --> 58:31.282
But it came out
the exact opposite

58:31.315 --> 58:32.317
of what you wanted to say?

58:32.350 --> 58:33.217
Me too.

58:33.250 --> 58:35.286
I was talking such
nonsense that my mother

58:35.319 --> 58:37.421
wanted to call Dr.
Frankenberg again.

58:37.455 --> 58:40.292
He just didn't come because
dad bit him last time.

58:40.324 --> 58:41.960
It's called a reverse curse.

58:41.993 --> 58:45.964
I looked it up, pretty bad
black magic and totally illegal.

58:45.996 --> 58:47.465
It makes us say the opposite

58:47.498 --> 58:49.368
of what we actually
want to say to others.

58:49.400 --> 58:51.435
But we're all
talking normally now.

58:51.469 --> 58:54.005
Because all three of
us were hit by the curse.

58:54.038 --> 58:56.274
Okay, that means we have
to find out for ourselves

58:56.308 --> 58:58.277
what Lucifer is up to.

58:58.310 --> 58:59.844
I'll check out the book again.

58:59.877 --> 59:01.312
Maybe there's something else.

59:01.346 --> 59:05.284
Okay, and I'll look into
the thing about the 13th hour.

59:05.317 --> 59:08.219
And I'll find out how
magical beings turn vicious.

about the town hall.

By Elron Vongertz,
ode to Crailsfelden

01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:10.375
written on the
17th of March 1455.

01:01:10.407 --> 01:01:12.110
Believe me, I've
read all about it.

01:01:12.143 --> 01:01:14.246
And I've only found one way

01:01:14.279 --> 01:01:16.514
to make night creatures
vicious again.

01:01:16.547 --> 01:01:18.549
Only with a dark crystal magic...

01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:19.485
Turns back time.

01:01:20.618 --> 01:01:22.688
When I arrived here
with my father,

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:25.090
my blood fragment
started to glow,

01:01:25.123 --> 01:01:27.259
just as we drove past Town Hall.

01:01:27.292 --> 01:01:31.063
And at the same moment,
things went back in time.

01:01:31.096 --> 01:01:32.097
At the town hall?

01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:37.036
When the town hall strikes
13, the world will end.

01:01:38.469 --> 01:01:42.139
In any case, this time
magic has something to do

01:01:42.172 --> 01:01:43.375
with my blood fragment.

01:01:43.407 --> 01:01:45.310
Nothing against
your crystal, Vlad,

01:01:45.342 --> 01:01:48.446
but it's far from large enough
for such a powerful spell.

That's right, we forgot
about the constable.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.725
Vlad, you distract Schnappauf.

01:02:33.757 --> 01:02:35.460

crawl through the ventilation
shafts, get into the town...

I think I have a better way.

You know, vampires
have no reflection

01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:44.503
and therefore cannot be filmed.

anything about it.

left hand and not my right.

your left hand.

from my point of view,

01:03:25.877 --> 01:03:29.148
it is your right one
and on the monitor...

It doesn't matter.

01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:35.654

No, but there are zombies.

01:04:07.217 --> 01:04:08.719
I read about that.

01:04:08.752 --> 01:04:11.188
The city has to save,
so they replaced

quickly, cost nothing

the difference.

they're harmless.

being drawn to the tower.

Leave my friends in peace.

01:23:53.969 --> 01:23:58.976
Vlad, the crystal.

01:24:02.913 --> 01:24:05.715
This is the end of you.

Really, that was really it?

01:24:42.451 --> 01:24:44.321
That was a show, huh?

01:24:52.027 --> 01:24:53.530
Everything okay?

01:24:54.798 --> 01:24:56.967
Yes, what just happened?

01:24:58.935 --> 01:25:01.371

01:25:11.615 --> 01:25:13.617
Vlad, I'm here.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:14.951
So I see dad.

01:25:17.087 --> 01:25:18.821
Everything okay, my son?

01:25:18.855 --> 01:25:19.990
I was very worried.

01:25:20.022 --> 01:25:21.725
What happened anyway?

01:25:21.758 --> 01:25:26.029
So I was a werewolf, well,
a little bit and Faye flew.

01:25:26.062 --> 01:25:28.966
And Vlad, Vlad was a vampire.

01:25:28.999 --> 01:25:29.900
He drank blood.

(VLAD RETCHES)

01:25:37.173 --> 01:25:41.444
Okay, maybe we don't have
to tell the others everything.

01:25:46.883 --> 01:25:51.688
NARRATOR: And so it was,
that Vlad, Faye and Wolf,

01:25:51.721 --> 01:25:56.727
the unlikeliest of heroes
defeated the devil himself.

01:25:57.928 --> 01:26:01.698
Thanks to them, all humans
and mythical creatures alike,

01:26:01.731 --> 01:26:06.737
were saved from Lucifer's
eternal reign of power.

01:26:07.603 --> 01:26:09.039
But we saved the entire town

01:26:09.071 --> 01:26:11.141
and they didn't notice anything.

01:26:11.173 --> 01:26:13.444
Maybe that's a
good thing, Wolf.

01:26:13.477 --> 01:26:16.046
You know, maybe one or
the other wouldn't mind

01:26:16.079 --> 01:26:17.714
being wild and dangerous again,

01:26:17.746 --> 01:26:19.516

guzzle like that.

01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:22.085

01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:25.054
But it's so good.

01:26:25.989 --> 01:26:30.060
Oh, and Vlad, I think
this belongs to you.

01:26:30.093 --> 01:26:31.595
I'm giving it back to you.

01:26:35.831 --> 01:26:37.066
Thank you.

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:39.003
Your mother would be
proud of you, and so am I.

01:26:40.504 --> 01:26:42.005
By the way, that I kissed you

01:26:42.038 --> 01:26:45.008
was purely for
technical reasons, okay?

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.109
You guys kissed?

01:26:46.142 --> 01:26:47.811
Dad.

01:26:47.843 --> 01:26:49.111
I mean, it's none of my
business, I just wanted to,

01:26:49.145 --> 01:26:49.980
was it more on the cheek or...

01:26:50.012 --> 01:26:51.581
We'll see you later, dad.

01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:56.553
HANNAPPEL: For purely
tactical reasons, huh?

01:26:56.585 --> 01:26:57.721
Tactics.

01:26:57.754 --> 01:26:59.690
Yes, tactics,
tactics are important.

01:26:59.722 --> 01:27:00.790
The most important.

01:27:02.157 --> 01:27:04.695
Without tactics we're
tactless, it's how we tick.

01:27:04.727 --> 01:27:06.896
So guys, if we're
in a gang now,

01:27:06.929 --> 01:27:09.199
we also need a name, such as-

01:27:09.231 --> 01:27:10.900
- The Pig Pack.

01:27:10.933 --> 01:27:13.136
No, I was thinking
of something cool.

01:27:13.169 --> 01:27:15.105
Like the Wolf...

01:27:15.137 --> 01:27:17.106
Well, check this.

01:27:17.139 --> 01:27:20.511
Why are you three losers
in such a good mood?

01:27:20.544 --> 01:27:22.179
And you belong to me, redhead.

01:27:22.212 --> 01:27:23.914
My name's on your forehead.

01:27:23.946 --> 01:27:24.748
Really?

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:26.015
It says pimple face.

01:27:26.048 --> 01:27:28.685
Hey, this is Pimple
Face, he's Meathead.

01:27:28.718 --> 01:27:30.053
Shut your mouth, Pig Cheeks.

01:27:30.085 --> 01:27:30.954
Did you just call me Meathead?

01:27:30.986 --> 01:27:31.888
That was her.

01:27:31.922 --> 01:27:32.755
No, it wasn't.

01:27:32.789 --> 01:27:33.956
Pimple Face is right.

01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:35.292
This is Pimple Face, I'm...

01:27:35.325 --> 01:27:37.027
Shut your mouth, Pig Cheeks.

01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:38.195
Can we just move on?

01:27:38.227 --> 01:27:40.830
Don't interrupt,
Meathead and Pig Cheeks.

01:27:40.864 --> 01:27:42.165

01:27:42.197 --> 01:27:43.100
Shut up!

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:44.568
No, you shut up, Pimple Face.

01:27:44.601 --> 01:27:45.701
- Get off!
- Get off!

01:27:45.735 --> 01:27:47.103
I was just trying to clarify...

01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:48.172
