00:05.339 --> 00:06.340
Previously, on Hightown...

00:06.374 --> 00:08.676
- How do I taste?
- Like a spring rain.

00:08.709 --> 00:13.080
I was just wondering
if, you know...

00:13.114 --> 00:14.081
it's just us.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.216
I don't even care about that.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.450
I just don't want you to
fuck up this case.

00:16.484 --> 00:17.752
I love the kid.
He's my only son,

00:17.785 --> 00:19.153
but he can't fish for shit.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.722
Maybe I should go talk to him,
make sure he's good.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.424
They find out you're the girl
asking questions,

00:23.457 --> 00:24.592
they will fucking kill you.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.627
You DAs are so concerned
with batting 1.000

00:26.660 --> 00:28.329
you're not even willing to take
a fucking swing, are you?

00:28.362 --> 00:30.297
Do your job, Sergeant.
Then you can tell me how to do
mine.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.633
You know, we hooked up
with that carfentanil now,

00:32.666 --> 00:34.168
straight Chinaman shit.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.336
- You ain't gonna need a lot.
- One!

00:35.369 --> 00:36.637
- I got a daughter, man.
- Two!

00:41.041 --> 00:43.544
Maybe I might go down
to the D.R. for a while, lay
low.

00:43.577 --> 00:44.645
What did you do?
Just tell me.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.580
I'm a fucking killer, okay?

00:46.614 --> 00:47.782
Junior, you in there?

02:34.221 --> 02:35.356
Hey, girl.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.891
What, the fuck man?
It's late.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.659
Donna had the baby this morning.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.361
Shit, congratulations.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.429
Yeah.
Hey, can I come in?

02:42.463 --> 02:44.431
- Bro...
- Hey, but...

02:44.465 --> 02:46.300
I got something you like.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.202
Want it?

02:48.235 --> 02:49.870
Yeah.
No.

02:49.904 --> 02:51.272
Let me in.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.741
All right, there we go.
Beautiful.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.578
So I'm waiting for this guy...

02:57.611 --> 02:58.712
- That's not your fault, right?
- No, no, no.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.381
I-I was with a guy.
I-I was with a--

03:00.414 --> 03:02.283
I didn't have my phone.
I didn't even know she was in
labor.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.918
- But Donna will understand.
- Yeah, well, she's the one that
told me

03:03.951 --> 03:06.220
not to come if I was fucked up.
That is kind of bullshit, right?

03:06.253 --> 03:07.621
Yeah, I mean, that's fucking
bullshit. You should be able

03:07.655 --> 03:08.956
- to see your own fucking kid.
- What am I supposed to do?

03:09.189 --> 03:10.257
I don't got my phone,
you know what I mean?

03:10.291 --> 03:11.525
Oh, fuck, this is good shit.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.327
Right.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.728
Where'd you get this shit?

03:14.762 --> 03:16.463
I've been getting
the worst shit lately.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.799
This shit is good.
I'm so fucking thirsty.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.670
What is wrong with me?

03:22.703 --> 03:25.706
Jesus.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.809
Oh, what the fuck kind of
asshole doesn't sh-show up

03:28.842 --> 03:30.344
to the hospital to see his kid,
you know?

03:30.377 --> 03:31.345
Fuck.
Fuck!

03:31.378 --> 03:32.413
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.614
Whoa, it's okay.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.215
- No, it's not. It's not okay.
- It's--

03:35.249 --> 03:36.784
It's not okay.
I'm a fucking asshole, piece of
shit.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.986
That's who I am.
Jesus fuck.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.557
Whoa, wait. Wait.
Here's the thing, though.

03:44.825 --> 03:49.496
Babies are, like--they're,
like, really little and new.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.664
Everything's gonna
be different now.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.733
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You think?

03:52.766 --> 03:53.934
Yeah, yeah.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.538
You know, my mother always did
say babies were a blessing.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.006
Yeah, see,
that's what I'm fucking talking
about.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.474
They're a fucking blessing.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.410
You get a-a-a whole new life
to do everything right.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.446
Yeah, that's it. I'm gonna do it
better. I'm gonna do it all
better.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.747
- Yeah.
- I'll be--I'll be a good
fucking dad.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.015
Fuck yeah, you are!

04:08.248 --> 04:09.483
Yeah, I mean, how hard can it
fucking be, right?

04:09.516 --> 04:11.251
- Yeah, my dad did it.
- Yeah.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.787
Oh, she's big, dude, too.
She's big--nine pounds.

04:13.821 --> 04:14.788
Yeah?

04:14.822 --> 04:15.756
I think she's gonna
be pretty like Donna.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.391
Oh, man, that's fucking awesome.
What's her name?

04:17.424 --> 04:18.726
- Mackayleigh.
- Mackayleigh.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.027
Yeah, it's a good name,
isn't it?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.428
- It's a fucking great name!
- That's a great name.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.863
Man, see, that's what
I'm talking about.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.699
Babies are a blessing.
#Blessed.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.902
#Blessed! Yes!

04:55.829 --> 04:56.797
Is that him?

05:05.739 --> 05:07.441
Yeah.

05:11.612 --> 05:12.713
Hey, guys.

05:12.746 --> 05:13.847
Sir?

05:15.416 --> 05:16.850
Dope he had on him,

05:16.884 --> 05:18.085
want you to field
test it tonight,

05:18.318 --> 05:19.620
and get it to lab first thing
in the morning.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.455
Put a fucking rush on it.

05:41.075 --> 05:44.478
First day we met...I lied.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.415
I never seen a dead body
before in my life.

05:50.084 --> 05:53.053
And now everywhere I go,
there's fucking death.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.422
Yeah.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.492
Well, it comes with the job.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.094
Not my job.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.496
You wanted to be a part of this.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.698
Yeah, you're right.
I did.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.701
Now I can't remember why.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.576
I wanna go home.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.979
All right.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.050
Come on.
I'll give you a ride.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.447
Hey.
My friend died today.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.216
Wanna buy me a drink?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.517
Mm-hmm.

07:35.889 --> 07:39.993
So it's been two days,
and can any one of you fucking
mopes...

07:40.027 --> 07:42.963
tell me where Osito is right
here, right now?

07:45.132 --> 07:46.900
Anyone?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.869
- Hello?
- He hasn't been to O'Donnell's.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.103
He hasn't been to Kathleen's.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.240
He's been a ghost since
Junior McCarthy died.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.675
What about Kizzle?

07:56.543 --> 07:59.213
His mom hasn't seen him,
but she says that's normal.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.181
You check the airlines?
You check the bus lines?

08:01.215 --> 08:02.149
Have you checked to see
if they went off the Cape?

08:02.182 --> 08:03.150
We're working on it, Ray.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.485
- Did you squeeze Kathleen?
- What the fuck do you think,
man?

08:05.519 --> 08:06.620
- You know what I think?
- What?

08:06.653 --> 08:07.621
I think not one of you
is anything less

08:07.654 --> 08:09.056
than completely fucking useless.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.024
I think not one of you knows
how to cultivate a CI for shit.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.960
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Hey, Ray!

08:12.993 --> 08:15.529
- And I think not one of you--
- Yo, what's going on, man?

08:15.562 --> 08:18.031
Fuck.
Being a dick.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.101
Last time I checked,
Frankie and Osito got

08:21.134 --> 08:23.170
three bodies between them,
the key witness in my case is
dead,

08:23.203 --> 08:24.671
and no one knows
where the fuck Osito is.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.273
So you know what?
I have a right to be a fucking
dick.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.242
Well, I got some news
on your case.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.943
Lab just called.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.546
The shit that Junior
took wasn't pure,

08:32.579 --> 08:34.248
wasn't a hot shot.

08:34.281 --> 08:37.184
ME's gonna rule it
a good old-fashioned accidental
overdose

08:37.217 --> 08:38.852
in a Dibby Donuts bathroom.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.020
Ah, fuck.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.989
But there's something else.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.192
The shot he took
was a mix of dope,

08:45.225 --> 08:48.228
baby laxative, and carfentanil.

08:48.262 --> 08:50.564
First documented case
on Cape Cod.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.101
- Holy shit, Al.
- Yeah, oh, shit.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.070
Now you wanna come
and break it to LT?

08:58.672 --> 09:00.140
I got something
I gotta get into.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.201
You still mad at me?

10:10.811 --> 10:12.346
Tell me what's wrong, mi amor.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.680
I'll understand.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.353
I'm tired, Frankie.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.955
I'm tired of this.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.759
Tired of coming to this place.
I...

10:27.361 --> 10:29.162
I don't know how much longer
I can do it.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.630
It's not gonna be forever.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.067
No, just 15 more years now?

10:34.101 --> 10:35.102
No.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.071
It's not like that.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.175
I'm gonna beat this thing.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.712
How?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.314
My crew stepped up.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.651
Kizzle, O,
they took care of everything.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.420
What does that mean, Frankie,
took care of what?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.022
You know better than to ask.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.861
I need to know you have my back.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.264
I need to think about our son.

11:04.297 --> 11:07.100
That's all I think about:
you and Frankie.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.171
Everything I ever did was
for you two, for your futures.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.974
I don't have a future, Frankie.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.445
- Okay? I work at Xavier's.
- Fuck Xavier's!

11:21.281 --> 11:22.682
I'll buy it for
you, if you want.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.752
You're my queen.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.888
I'm gonna give you
everything you ever wanted.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.125
I'm gonna take care of you
for the rest of your life.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.466
How you gonna do that?

11:43.170 --> 11:45.806
I need you to promise me
that I still have you.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.043
Without you,
none of it means anything.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.948
Mamita.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.851
Promise me.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.025
Okay.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.034
Frank-Frankie,
what are you doing?

12:15.202 --> 12:19.239
- Renee Samantha Segna...
- Oh, my God.

12:21.808 --> 12:22.909
Will you marry me?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.959
Hey, Kathleen O'Donnell.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.860
You know you didn't use
your blinker back there?

14:20.894 --> 14:22.963
- Really, bro?
- Really.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.298
I'ma need you to go ahead
and step out of the vehicle,
please.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.567
Come on.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.081
I'm not gonna find anything
in here I shouldn't, am I?

14:41.114 --> 14:42.382
No.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.561
What's this, then?

14:57.464 --> 15:00.267
I don't think Daddy's
gonna be too happy...

15:00.300 --> 15:03.637
with the 10 grams of dope
in the Beemer.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.138
Come on.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.473
Just tell us where you got it.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.174
Nigga, please.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.376
I told you that shit's not mine.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.411
Did she just use
the fucking N-word?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.246
Huh?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.682
I said "a", not "er."

15:15.915 --> 15:17.951
Well, fucking excuse me.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.686
You know, here's the thing.
I know your type.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.554
You're just a little rich girl
from Chatham,

15:21.588 --> 15:23.390
slumming it
with a big, bad drug dealer.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.259
You know, you're thinking
this is a joke.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.460
It's not.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.630
You're looking at some
serious time here, Kathleen.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.167
You, what, 25, 26?

15:34.200 --> 15:36.636
You'll be almost our age
when you get out.

15:38.004 --> 15:38.938
Jesus.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.942
What do you want from me?

15:42.976 --> 15:45.512
Tell us where Osito is.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.180
I don't know.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.515
No.
No, no!

15:49.516 --> 15:51.084
Cut the fucking bullshit!

15:52.552 --> 15:54.688
You are so far in
over your fucking head.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.590
You are fucking drowning
right now.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.560
This man's your fucking
lifeguard. Talk to him.

16:00.593 --> 16:04.164
Osito ghosted me, okay?

16:04.197 --> 16:06.599
He called me a few days ago and
said he was going back to the
Dominican,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.668
but that I shouldn't
tell anyone.

16:08.702 --> 16:11.171
He never came to say good-bye,
and-and since then,

16:11.204 --> 16:12.605
his phone goes
straight to voicemail.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.375
Okay?
I swear to God, that's all I
know.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.685
It's all right.
You're doing great.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.456
Osito say anything
about a murder?

16:31.024 --> 16:32.158
No, never.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.993
What about a drug
called carfentanil?

16:35.195 --> 16:36.563
No.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.099
Look, we don't wanna jam you up

16:39.132 --> 16:40.600
about the stuff in the car...

16:42.268 --> 16:44.104
But you gotta give us something.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.238
All right?

16:46.373 --> 16:50.043
And, honestly, he doesn't really
seem like that great of a
boyfriend.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.614
Okay.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.154
So this one time,
he took me up to this dude's
crib

17:01.187 --> 17:02.555
in-in New Bedford.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.124
New Bedford, huh?

17:07.560 --> 17:08.661
- Hey.
- What is it?

17:08.695 --> 17:11.030
Kathleen just dropped
a dime on Osito.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.099
He fled to D.R. right around the
time Junior McCarthy died,

17:13.133 --> 17:14.534
probably to lay low
because of the Collins thing.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.202
So I don't know how you feel
about the extradition route.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.037
Anything else?

17:18.071 --> 17:19.406
Yeah.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.141
I think I got a line
on Frankie and Osito's

17:21.174 --> 17:23.476
suppliers in New Bedford.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.711
Oh, yeah?

17:24.744 --> 17:27.380
Mm-hmm, old-ass
Cape Verdean dude.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.783
Wayne Grasa, real OG,
rap sheet as long as your dick.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.418
- Oh, so very long, then.
- Exactly,

17:31.451 --> 17:33.453
and I think that's
the carfentanil connection.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.221
Now I know it's a little bit
out of our jurisdiction,

17:35.255 --> 17:36.790
but we should set up
an operation in New Bedford.

17:36.823 --> 17:37.824
We get a few people in there,

17:38.057 --> 17:40.360
make some buys,
set up a wire.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.696
This guy, Grasa--I mean, he can
just hand us Frankie and Osito.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.065
I'm gonna put a
call in to the DA.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.667
I think with the
carfentanil angle

17:47.700 --> 17:49.369
and imminent danger--
blah, blah--

17:49.402 --> 17:51.070
I can get her to sign off
on a warrant.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.072
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Search warrant, right now?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.376
Respectfully, sir,
I don't think we should blow our
wad

17:56.409 --> 17:57.777
on maybe getting a few grams
of carfentanil.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.212
Let's build a case here.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.514
There have been
two drug murders on the Cape

18:01.548 --> 18:02.649
in less than a month,

18:02.682 --> 18:04.384
three if you include
Scotty Frazier,

18:04.417 --> 18:06.252
plus the OD of a key witness.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.353
Yeah, so?

18:07.387 --> 18:08.555
So it would be nice to make

18:08.588 --> 18:10.223
some good headlines,
don't you think?

18:10.256 --> 18:12.725
- Sir.
- I'm gonna call the DA about a
warrant.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.627
We'll include the New Bedford PD

18:14.661 --> 18:16.429
for the interagency
cooperation angle,

18:16.463 --> 18:18.231
and if this goes well,
we'll do a presser.

18:27.373 --> 18:30.610
I mean, I don't know why some
people make it and some people
don't.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.279
Um, maybe it's not
for me to know.

18:33.313 --> 18:37.183
I'm just so grateful to have
my seat in here tonight,

18:37.217 --> 18:39.552
and, uh, um, that's it, thanks.

18:44.858 --> 18:48.495
At this time, we'd like to
welcome any newcomers

18:48.528 --> 18:50.230
in their first 30 days.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.298
Any newcomers?

18:57.570 --> 19:00.874
Jackie, alcoholic,
day one again.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.510
It's gotta stick
one of these days, right?

19:03.543 --> 19:06.212
Welcome, Jackie.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.782
Thanks.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.753
I was on time, so you know.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.656
When's your court date?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.458
Um, in two weeks.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.792
Living on borrowed time.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.364
How you doing?

19:24.397 --> 19:25.665
I'm fine.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.702
Yeah, okay.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.572
You can play tough
if you want...

19:32.605 --> 19:35.475
just another way of feeling
sorry for yourself.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.577
But we got a saying around here.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.412
Better him than you.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.415
Jesus, that's kind of fucked up.

19:42.448 --> 19:43.750
What does that mean?

19:43.783 --> 19:46.319
It means drinking
yourself to death

19:46.352 --> 19:47.720
won't bring Junior back.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.660
Yeah, well, there's only
one way to find out.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.639
- Jackie, what are you doing?
- Hey.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.575
You're in your skivvies?
Oh, come on, it's almost 11:00.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.477
It's time to hit the showers.
We gotta get going.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.645
Oh, right.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.413
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

20:50.984 --> 20:54.520
Jackie, um, you-you go in there.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.456
I'm gonna--I'm gonna
put this right here,

20:56.489 --> 20:57.924
and I'm gonna make some coffee.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.360
- What is it?
- I told Linda you didn't have a
suit,

21:00.393 --> 21:02.028
and she said she was going
to Marshalls anyway.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.501
Thank you all for
being here today.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.636
I'm Junior's father.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.674
I don't really know
what I'm supposed to say.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.379
Junior was a good kid.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.948
He was a happy kid.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.920
He loved being out on the boat.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.392
You know, he got--
he got stressed about things
sometimes.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.793
Yeah, it's-it's normal, right?

21:33.826 --> 21:35.328
I don't know.
I'm not--I...

21:38.398 --> 21:39.899
I'm not good
at giving speeches.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.838
I was hoping I'd never
have to give this one.

21:51.577 --> 21:52.712
Hope.

21:56.883 --> 22:00.353
Well, that's part of being a
parent, right, never giving up
hope.

22:01.688 --> 22:02.889
Even if it makes you the sucker,

22:02.922 --> 22:05.558
even if it--even if it
makes you a fool, you...

22:09.696 --> 22:11.364
How can it...

22:11.397 --> 22:12.865
how can it be any other way?

22:16.436 --> 22:17.904
How could you not hope?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.677
I'm sorry.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.648
Thank you for coming.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.398
Oh, man, I don't wanna do this.

22:45.431 --> 22:46.566
- Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no.
- I wanna go home.

22:46.599 --> 22:47.900
No, no, no.
No.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.403
No, you're gonna go in there,
and you're gonna eat a cookie,

22:50.436 --> 22:52.772
and you're gonna tell
these people how sorry you are.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.742
God, nobody likes doing this,
but it's what you do.

22:55.775 --> 22:56.743
Come on.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.584
What the fuck
is she doing here?

23:05.685 --> 23:07.086
Donna.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.721
You said you were
gonna find him.

23:08.755 --> 23:09.555
Whoa, hold on, hold on.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.389
You said you were
gonna take care of him,

23:10.423 --> 23:11.758
- and you didn't do shit.
- Whoa.

23:11.791 --> 23:12.992
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, you should be
fucking sorry!

23:13.025 --> 23:13.993
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey!

23:14.026 --> 23:15.728
How the fuck you gonna show your
face around here?

23:15.762 --> 23:17.463
You should be fucking ashamed
of yourself.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.831
That's okay.
I'm leaving, all right?

23:18.865 --> 23:20.099
- Yeah, you better.
- I'm gonna go.

23:20.133 --> 23:21.667
Get the fuck out!

23:21.701 --> 23:22.902
Get off me.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.944
Hey, Jackie.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.714
Jackie, come here.
I wanna talk to you.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.782
What the fuck
are you doing here?

23:35.815 --> 23:36.983
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.451
What, are you some kind
of ghoul who likes funerals?

23:38.484 --> 23:39.786
No, I fucking hate
'em, all right?

23:39.819 --> 23:42.488
But it's-it's good to see
who shows up.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.056
You might learn a thing or two.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.425
- Well, did ya?
- No.

23:46.459 --> 23:47.827
Are you okay?

23:47.860 --> 23:50.863
No, I'm not fucking okay.

23:50.897 --> 23:54.000
Junior's dead,
everyone fucking hates me,

23:54.033 --> 23:56.502
and I-I tried to help,
but I couldn't do shit

23:56.536 --> 23:57.804
'cause everything I
touch turns to shit.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.740
Hey, hey, I know.
Hey, hey, hey, listen to me.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.742
Junior's not on you.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.143
Okay?
This is not your fault.

24:04.177 --> 24:05.211
He just drew a bad hand.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.481
What about you?
What the fuck are you doing?

24:08.514 --> 24:09.515
You catch Osito yet?

24:09.549 --> 24:11.818
No, he fled the country.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.086
- Fuck, fuck.
- Yeah, but listen.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.022
I think I got a line on his
suppliers in New Bedford,

24:16.055 --> 24:17.590
the ones with the dope
that killed Junior.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.091
Now, against my
better judgement,

24:19.125 --> 24:20.960
we're executing a search warrant
tomorrow morning.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.062
So we are doing shit, okay?

24:23.095 --> 24:24.931
Okay.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.599
Okay.
I'm from New Bedford.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.734
- I'm coming with you.
- Whoa, hold on.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.169
- No, that's not the way it
works. - Come on, man.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.771
I thought we were past that.
You know I know what I'm doing.

24:31.804 --> 24:32.972
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do,

24:33.005 --> 24:34.540
but I don't know
where your head's at.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.675
That makes you dangerous.

24:37.076 --> 24:40.179
Don't make me fucking beg, man.
I'm going out of my skin.

24:40.213 --> 24:41.514
Okay.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.985
Okay.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.587
Pick you up tomorrow morning,
0500.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.821
Thank you.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.593
And Jackie?

24:55.494 --> 24:56.963
Don't drink tonight.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.053
Hey.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.856
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.532
Hey, listen,
I can't sleep over tonight,
okay?

25:33.566 --> 25:35.034
I have this early thing
in the morning.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.035
Okay.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.203
But, um, there's something
I gotta say to you.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.204
Okay.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.706
All right, I don't...

25:40.740 --> 25:41.807
I really don't
wanna fuck this up,

25:41.841 --> 25:44.143
'cause it's good...right?

25:44.176 --> 25:45.778
I mean, it's good
between us, right?

25:47.546 --> 25:48.614
- Yeah.
- Yeah

25:49.849 --> 25:52.084
But I gotta let you know...

25:52.118 --> 25:55.121
I'm never gonna let up on
Frankie. Okay?

25:55.154 --> 25:56.689
You gotta know that
I'm never gonna give up.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.859
And if that's a problem for you,

25:59.892 --> 26:02.128
now's the time for you
to tell me, okay?

26:04.230 --> 26:05.564
Yeah.

26:05.598 --> 26:09.869
He's...he's Frankie's dad,
you know?

26:09.902 --> 26:12.238
He's done a lot for me.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.107
I know what he is.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.813
And I know you have to do
what you need to do.

26:22.915 --> 26:23.950
We both do.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.719
Hey, what are you doing?

27:01.287 --> 27:02.621
I wanna take care of you.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.825
Let me take care of you.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.971
Oh, baby, you're so good to me.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.755
Hey, you okay?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.123
Yeah, yeah, stop asking.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.191
Okay, let's release the hounds.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.127
- Hey, guys. Good morning.
- Morning.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.762
All right, you know the drill.
We go in hard and fast.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.064
We secure the scene before
anyone catches an attitude.

27:45.097 --> 27:48.701
This is Jackie Quinones,
National Marine Fishery
Services.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.436
Let's try not to get her killed.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.737
Watch out for
crossfire, all right?

27:51.771 --> 27:53.439
Quinones, Babcock,
you're on sentry.

27:53.672 --> 27:54.940
Mackson, you're on the ram.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.375
Rest of us, move inside.

27:56.409 --> 27:58.077
Girls on door duty.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.713
Yeah, exactly.
You got any questions?

28:00.746 --> 28:02.214
- Nope.
- Good to go?

28:02.248 --> 28:03.282
- Let's roll.
- All right, let's do it.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.683
Let's go. Let's go.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.804
You guys 100?

28:24.837 --> 28:25.971
Mike, on you.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.353
State Police search warrant!

28:41.387 --> 28:44.290
State Police!

28:45.391 --> 28:46.759
Let's move!
Let's move!

28:49.195 --> 28:51.263
State Police! Show me your
hands! Show me your hands!

28:51.297 --> 28:53.432
- Get off of me.
- Against the wall.

28:53.466 --> 28:55.301
Don't touch my sister,
motherfucker!

28:55.334 --> 28:57.069
Quiet over there!

28:57.103 --> 28:59.472
Hands, hands!
Let me see your hands,
motherfucker!

28:59.505 --> 29:01.373
Clear!

29:01.407 --> 29:03.375
Got a search warrant
for your fucking place.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.113
Come on, we're clear.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.183
Y'all wanna save us some time,

29:11.217 --> 29:13.085
tell us where you
keep the stash,

29:13.119 --> 29:14.820
or we gotta pour your cereal
out on the floor.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.856
I don't give a fuck what you do.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.023
Well, who are you?

29:18.057 --> 29:19.191
Fuck off.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.759
That's charming.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.761
Tell me about
carfentanil, Wayne.

29:22.795 --> 29:23.996
Car-what?

29:24.029 --> 29:25.931
When we find the dope
that killed Junior McCarthy,

29:25.965 --> 29:27.233
it's not gonna be a
good look for you.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.802
So if you wanna avoid
manslaughter charges, talk to
me.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.537
Who the fuck is Junior McCarthy?

29:31.770 --> 29:34.773
Well, tell us about
the last time you saw Osito.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.108
- Well--
- Right.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.244
I know, I know, "Who's Osito?"

29:38.277 --> 29:39.979
- Hey, Ray, look what I found.
- Oh!

29:40.012 --> 29:42.248
Look at that.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.049
Hey, Wayne,
you got permits for these?

29:44.083 --> 29:45.851
No?
Didn't think so.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.119
- You know the drill,
motherfucker. - Mm-hmm.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.220
Hey, guess what.
Maybe you'll think of something

29:48.254 --> 29:49.388
to say while you're in lockup.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.023
You think I ain't been
locked up before?

29:51.056 --> 29:52.291
Man, come on. Get up.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.198
All right. All right, listen.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.866
I really wanna give you
a chance here.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.403
So if you give me something,

30:04.436 --> 30:06.572
maybe I don't call DCF
to pick you up.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.174
Don't try to play me out.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.376
You know you don't
need to call DCF.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.178
Our Auntie Ruth will pick us up.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.483
Okay.
Call Auntie Ruth.

30:17.516 --> 30:18.851
Wait, Ray.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.186
What the hell is going on?

30:20.219 --> 30:21.487
What do you mean?
They're minors.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.322
I don't have anything on 'em.
I can't arrest 'em.

30:23.355 --> 30:24.957
Wait, you didn't--
you didn't find anything,

30:24.990 --> 30:25.958
the shit that killed Junior?

30:25.991 --> 30:27.493
Look, we're still looking.

30:27.526 --> 30:28.527
If they're smart,
they're not gonna keep

30:28.561 --> 30:29.828
anything in the house anyway.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.430
So, what, you find some guns
and that's it?

30:31.463 --> 30:33.365
- This whole thing was bullshit?
- Hey.

30:33.399 --> 30:34.466
I hate to break
it to you, Jackie,

30:34.500 --> 30:35.935
but most of life is bullshit.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.103
Oh, Jesus.
I need a fucking cigarette.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.961
State Police!
Hands up!

31:01.994 --> 31:03.262
Put your fucking hands up!

31:04.330 --> 31:05.864
Put your fucking hands up!

31:09.101 --> 31:10.236
Put them up!

31:16.642 --> 31:18.611
Fucker!

31:18.644 --> 31:20.012
You fucker!

31:20.045 --> 31:21.113
Go! I got her!
I got her!

31:21.146 --> 31:22.881
Go, go!

31:24.383 --> 31:26.085
Fuck.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.419
Fucking go!

31:47.940 --> 31:49.508
That's creepy.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.410
You been watching me all night?

31:57.182 --> 31:58.284
I got shot.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.918
Fuck yeah, you did.

32:01.620 --> 32:02.588
Well played.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.156
What?

32:05.591 --> 32:06.925
He shot a federal agent.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.596
No matter what happens in court,
we got him.

32:10.629 --> 32:13.032
We got motherfucking Osito.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.201
It's the best thing
that could have happened.

32:19.371 --> 32:20.939
You're welcome.

32:22.207 --> 32:25.077
So he-he's okay?

32:25.110 --> 32:26.979
He took a few bullets,

32:27.012 --> 32:28.447
but they're saying
he's gonna pull through.

32:30.215 --> 32:31.317
You're really fucking lucky.

32:32.685 --> 32:34.453
- You could have died.
- Yeah.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.056
Yeah, I know.

32:37.089 --> 32:40.159
And then you would have felt
like a real piece of shit.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.661
Y-yeah.

32:42.695 --> 32:44.129
Yeah, I would.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.698
Seriously.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.033
I'm glad you're okay.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.468
Me too.

32:50.669 --> 32:54.606
I feel okay.
I-I feel...good.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.742
That the painkillers talking?

32:56.975 --> 33:00.012
Probably, but I'll take it.

33:00.045 --> 33:03.015
No, that's all right.
You take it. You deserve it.

33:03.048 --> 33:05.050
You did good.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.418
Why, 'cause I got shot?

33:06.452 --> 33:08.987
Yeah, and because
you're a good cop.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.323
Oh, my God, Jackie.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.125
Uh, they-they called me.
I didn't know.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.526
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.128
I'm okay.
I'm all right.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.366
You the one
responsible for this?

33:20.399 --> 33:22.034
Yes, sir.

33:22.067 --> 33:24.503
Sergeant Ray Abruzzo,
Mass. State Police.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.605
I don't know what kind
of fucking shenanigans goes on

33:26.638 --> 33:28.374
at the State Police,
but at the Fishery Services, we
have--

33:28.407 --> 33:29.408
Ed. Ed, hey.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.311
I'm-I'm okay.
It's all right.

33:32.344 --> 33:35.114
Sir, for what it's worth,
she's pretty tough.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.318
No fucking shit, Einstein.
Who are you telling?

33:39.351 --> 33:41.086
All right, I'm gonna go.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.721
Jackie, rest up.
We'll talk soon.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.230
They told me you got...

33:54.133 --> 33:56.668
They told me you got shot,
and I-I-I didn't know what to
think.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.206
Are you gonna fucking cry on me?

34:11.717 --> 34:13.118
- Minute.
- Mm-hmm.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.490
Hey, Osito.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.827
Looking good, buddy.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.763
That was a smart move...

34:24.797 --> 34:26.465
telling everybody
you went to the D.R.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.568
Cheaper than a plane ticket.

34:29.601 --> 34:32.604
Although, in hindsight,

34:32.638 --> 34:34.840
I bet you're wishing
you actually went.

34:35.073 --> 34:35.841
Huh?

34:38.076 --> 34:39.445
It's all good.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.680
You don't have to
talk right now.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.182
You're not going anywhere.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.085
I'll just come back
later, all right?

34:49.421 --> 34:50.522
Deep breaths, homey.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.348
Sit down.

35:16.381 --> 35:17.416
Come here.

35:19.418 --> 35:20.419
Get close.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.329
So how you doing, Frankie?

35:35.434 --> 35:36.568
Oh, cool.
Okay.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.339
Glad to hear that.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.407
Oh, me? Yeah.
No, I'm doing okay.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.211
No, I'm just fucking with you.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.213
I didn't come here
to talk about me.

35:48.247 --> 35:49.515
Came here to talk about you.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.352
Fuck am I?
I'm just some dumb Statie.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.453
But you, you're the man.

35:55.888 --> 35:56.855
You're the fucking man.

35:56.889 --> 35:58.223
You've been the man
since I was a baby trooper.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.258
You know that?

36:00.459 --> 36:03.295
2001, 2002,
remember those days?

36:04.630 --> 36:07.165
Kids were paying a dollar a
fucking milligram for an
OxyContin.

36:07.199 --> 36:08.567
Imagine that.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.702
And then suddenly--boom--
pills are gone.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.437
Everyone's shooting dope.
You know why?

36:12.471 --> 36:14.640
Because you had the idea
to come to the Cape,

36:14.673 --> 36:18.510
get a bunch of junkie white kids
to switch from pills to heroin.

36:19.945 --> 36:21.346
It's like shooting
fish in a barrel.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.516
Now, some people
say that's pussy,

36:24.550 --> 36:26.718
'cause you couldn't hack it
in Dorchester or East Boston,

36:26.752 --> 36:28.287
wherever the fuck
you're fucking from.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.657
But I don't say that.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.692
I say that was some
next-level shit.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.430
Then those kids,
they started dying.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.934
And then with fentanyl,
everyone started dying.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.936
And then the carfentanil--okay,
fuck it. Forget it.

36:43.969 --> 36:47.439
It's the fucking apocalypse,
but what do you care?

36:47.472 --> 36:49.641
'Cause you're still the man.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.948
You think about me too much.

36:55.981 --> 36:58.317
Oh, you're right.
I do.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.620
But hats off to you, man.
You had a great run.

37:01.653 --> 37:02.921
And if you hadn't killed Sherry,

37:02.955 --> 37:04.556
I think you would
have kept going.

37:04.590 --> 37:05.958
You could have done your bid,
gone back to the Cape,

37:05.991 --> 37:09.561
come back...picked up
right where you left off.

37:10.762 --> 37:13.332
But you had to show
what a big dick you had.

37:13.365 --> 37:16.635
You had to start
dropping bodies, and that...

37:19.004 --> 37:20.305
That's how I'm gonna fuck you.

37:21.707 --> 37:24.610
Also, your boy Osito,
he got in a shoot-out with a
cop.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.013
So I'm gonna fuck him too.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.648
And once he gets the breathing
tube out of his mouth,

37:29.681 --> 37:31.550
he's gonna tell me everything.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.286
'Cause you know, when you're
that close to death, it changes
a man.

37:37.322 --> 37:38.390
It's good to see you, Frankie.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.395
Like spring rain, huh, Ray?

37:44.796 --> 37:45.931
The fuck you just say to me?

37:47.733 --> 37:48.767
Renee.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.638
She tastes like spring rain.

37:54.306 --> 37:55.340
Isn't that right?

38:08.920 --> 38:11.690
- It's Uncle Ray.
- Don't answer that.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.393
- Hello?
- Hey, dude. Is your ma home?

38:14.426 --> 38:15.527
Yeah.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.734
Hey.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.603
Hey, how you doing?

38:25.771 --> 38:27.072
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.074
I can't really talk
right now, though.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.575
Yeah, okay, that's cool.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.710
You got anything going on later?

38:33.545 --> 38:35.981
Um, I don't--I don't know yet.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.719
I'm sorry, Ray.

38:47.526 --> 38:48.660
Yeah, no problem.

38:50.796 --> 38:51.863
Talk soon.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.580
What's going on?

39:08.613 --> 39:10.449
Oh, um, not much.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.950
Velekee's looking for you.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.785
About what?

39:13.819 --> 39:16.788
Couldn't say.
He, um--he's in the conference
room.

39:26.832 --> 39:29.101
Sergeant Abruzzo, come in.
Close the door.

39:35.474 --> 39:36.675
What's going on?

39:39.077 --> 39:40.445
Take a seat, Ray.

39:46.651 --> 39:48.420
All right.

39:48.453 --> 39:50.889
Let me guess,
got a promotion?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.158
I wanna show you something.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.565
Fuck is this?

40:00.599 --> 40:02.934
Looks to me like
a law enforcement officer

40:02.968 --> 40:05.170
receiving sexual favors
from an informant.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.405
Oh, you're so good to me.

40:07.439 --> 40:08.807
No, I don't--I don't...

40:12.511 --> 40:13.979
Where'd you get this?

40:16.615 --> 40:19.117
Renee Segna called me.

40:19.151 --> 40:20.819
She asked to sit down.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.655
She told me how you met,

40:23.688 --> 40:25.724
how you threatened her
with a prostitution charge

40:25.757 --> 40:28.493
if she didn't cooperate,
and that sometime after that,

40:28.527 --> 40:30.695
you solicited her
for a sexual relationship.

40:30.729 --> 40:31.897
Jesus Christ.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.165
She said she knew it was wrong.

40:33.198 --> 40:35.934
She knew it was, quote,
"fucked up,"

40:35.967 --> 40:37.602
but she went along with it.

40:37.636 --> 40:38.804
That's bullshit.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.940
There's gonna be
an internal investigation.

40:41.973 --> 40:44.142
Until then,
you're suspended without pay.

40:44.176 --> 40:45.210
She's a grown-up.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.547
I mean, she's not even
my CI anymore.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.582
She's the mother
of Frankie Cuevas's child.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.716
What the fuck were you thinking?

40:51.750 --> 40:53.518
Hey, I made that case.

40:53.552 --> 40:56.521
I put him away.
You got Frankie because of me.

40:56.555 --> 40:57.622
No, we didn't.

40:58.723 --> 41:01.092
We're dropping the charges
against Frankie Cuevas.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.495
What did you say?

41:03.528 --> 41:04.996
I discussed with my colleagues

41:05.030 --> 41:06.798
in the DA's Office,
and the brass weighed in as
well.

41:06.832 --> 41:09.167
We can't have this
coming out at trial.

41:09.201 --> 41:11.636
Are you fucking kidding me?
He's got three bodies on him.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.972
Does he?
'Cause I haven't seen any proof.

41:15.006 --> 41:17.008
I mean, can you imagine
the headlines?

41:17.042 --> 41:19.578
"#MeToo Comes
to the State Police."

41:19.611 --> 41:21.079
I can't believe you're gonna
let this guy walk.

41:21.112 --> 41:23.882
You know how many other cases
could be jeopardized by your
bullshit?

41:23.915 --> 41:25.917
We should be so lucky
it's only Frankie Cuevas.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.185
What the fuck does that mean?

41:27.219 --> 41:29.554
How many cases did Sherry Henry
make for you?

41:36.795 --> 41:38.730
It's time to go, Ray.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.887
Did you know? Hey.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.688
I said, did you fucking know?

42:03.722 --> 42:04.789
Yeah, I knew.

42:06.124 --> 42:07.259
Everybody knew.

42:10.662 --> 42:12.030
You brought this
on yourself, man.

42:24.643 --> 42:25.810
Fuck you looking at?

42:41.226 --> 42:42.727
Get your fucking hands off her.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.963
- Come here.
- Get the fuck off me.

42:44.996 --> 42:47.098
Hey, you blew up my life
for fucking what?

42:47.132 --> 42:48.733
Huh?
For that piece of shit?

42:48.767 --> 42:50.101
Fuck you.

42:50.135 --> 42:51.169
He's the father of my kid,
all right?

42:51.202 --> 42:52.203
What'd you expect?

42:52.237 --> 42:53.872
What, are you so fucking broken,

42:53.905 --> 42:55.206
you can't handle a guy
being nice to you?

42:55.240 --> 42:56.574
You were using me too.

42:56.608 --> 42:57.876
Oh, I was using you?
How?

42:57.909 --> 42:59.678
- How the fuck was I using you?
- Oh, come on, Ray.

42:59.711 --> 43:01.680
It was transactional.

43:01.713 --> 43:03.048
You know that as well as I do.

43:09.187 --> 43:10.889
I fucking loved you.

43:28.206 --> 43:30.075
So this mushroom
walks into a bar.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.911
The bartender says, "Oh, I'm
sorry, sir. We don't serve
mushrooms here."

43:32.944 --> 43:35.080
And the mushroom says,
"Why not? I'm a fun guy."

43:35.113 --> 43:36.614
Jesus.

43:36.648 --> 43:37.949
Just dump that anywhere, huh?

43:40.852 --> 43:44.189
You know, uh, while you're
laying around on disability and
all that,

43:44.222 --> 43:45.724
maybe you might wanna pick up
the place.

43:45.757 --> 43:49.094
Jesus, three weeks off.
What am I gonna do with myself?

43:50.028 --> 43:52.163
I know, I know.
I'm gonna go to one of those
meetings.

43:52.197 --> 43:54.399
That's my girl.

43:56.701 --> 43:58.770
So why didn't you tell me
you were mixed up in all this
shit?

44:01.773 --> 44:03.341
I didn't not tell
you on purpose.

44:03.375 --> 44:06.378
I just--I just didn't want you
to talk me out of it.

44:08.079 --> 44:10.382
It was something I had to do.
I can't explain it.

44:12.384 --> 44:14.786
I don't wanna worry
about you anymore.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.054
It's exhausting.

44:16.087 --> 44:17.722
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

44:18.857 --> 44:20.658
You don't have to worry anymore.
I'm okay.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.397
Hey, Linda's making scrod
this weekend.

44:27.999 --> 44:28.967
Wanna come over?

44:32.003 --> 44:33.738
You know how I love me
a good scrod.

44:35.206 --> 44:36.441
Thanks.
That'll be nice.

44:36.674 --> 44:39.144
Ah, Linda will be thrilled.

44:39.177 --> 44:41.046
Oh, hey,
can you take this for me?

44:41.079 --> 44:42.881
I don't need 60 Vicodin
laying around.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.117
Who are you, and what the fuck
did you do with my partner?

44:47.385 --> 44:49.154
I'm right here.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.292
Hey.

45:23.721 --> 45:24.923
Hello?

45:24.956 --> 45:26.925
Jackie, this is your attorney,
Phil Hancock.

45:26.958 --> 45:28.760
How are you?

45:28.793 --> 45:29.961
Hi.
I'm okay.

45:29.994 --> 45:31.396
What's going on?

45:31.429 --> 45:33.465
I don't know how you did it,
but I was just informed

45:33.498 --> 45:35.467
the DA'S Office
dropped your case.

45:36.968 --> 45:38.203
What?

45:38.236 --> 45:39.938
Yeah, some cop pulled a favor.

45:39.971 --> 45:42.407
The file is stamped
"in the interest of justice,"

45:42.440 --> 45:44.876
which means you must have done
something good for somebody.

45:46.144 --> 45:48.913
Yeah, yeah, I guess I did.
What--was it Ray Abruzzo?

45:50.215 --> 45:54.052
Uh, it was a State cop
named Alan Saintille.

45:55.753 --> 45:57.455
Alan Saintille?
Okay, wow.

45:57.489 --> 45:59.824
Uh...

45:59.858 --> 46:01.092
so what-what-what
does that mean?

46:01.126 --> 46:02.293
I'm done?

46:02.327 --> 46:03.928
I'm free?
I can drive?

46:03.962 --> 46:05.330
You're free.

46:05.363 --> 46:06.431
Take care of yourself.

46:07.932 --> 46:08.933
All right, thanks.

46:22.413 --> 46:24.482
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:25.850 --> 46:27.318
How's your shoulder?

46:27.352 --> 46:29.821
Um, it's okay.
It's a little sore.

46:29.854 --> 46:31.055
- Yeah.
- Looking for Alan.

46:31.089 --> 46:32.090
Oh.

46:33.525 --> 46:35.260
Where's Ray?

46:36.794 --> 46:38.329
I can't talk about it.

46:44.435 --> 46:46.804
- Hi, there.
- Oh, hey.

46:46.838 --> 46:49.307
I just, uh, wanted
to come by and thank you

46:49.340 --> 46:50.542
for the DUI thing.

46:50.575 --> 46:53.545
Well, hey, you literally
took a bullet for us.

46:53.578 --> 46:55.280
Least I could do.

46:56.581 --> 46:59.317
So, uh, where's Ray?

47:00.451 --> 47:02.086
There's been a shake-up.

47:02.120 --> 47:04.088
What do you--what happened?

47:05.823 --> 47:07.225
Something you have to ask him.

47:09.027 --> 47:11.095
Oh, another thing
you should know.

47:11.129 --> 47:14.199
Frankie Cuevas is being
released from prison.

47:14.232 --> 47:16.401
What?
How?

47:17.902 --> 47:20.104
Something else
you have to ask your boy.

47:20.138 --> 47:22.974
Frankie's a fucking murderer.
You can't just let him out.

47:23.007 --> 47:24.943
- It's complicated.
- No, yeah, but you're-you're
gonna--

47:24.976 --> 47:26.377
you're still gonna
work the case, right?

47:26.411 --> 47:28.613
- I mean, you still wanna get
him. - In a perfect world, yes.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.582
We have to see how it plays out.

47:32.884 --> 47:34.085
Okay, well...

47:35.620 --> 47:37.322
I wanna help.

47:38.990 --> 47:40.358
How would that work?

47:41.960 --> 47:44.262
I don't know.
You said you'd take anybody.

47:44.295 --> 47:47.131
Fishery Service Liaison
to the Narcotics Unit

47:47.165 --> 47:48.333
or something like that.

47:51.035 --> 47:53.538
All right, um...

47:53.571 --> 47:55.940
well, brass has been
making noise about diversity.

47:57.075 --> 47:58.276
Maybe I can sell it.

48:01.312 --> 48:02.880
Cool.
Thank you.

48:07.085 --> 48:08.553
Poor Ray.

48:08.586 --> 48:10.088
Man, fuck Ray.

48:26.638 --> 48:28.573
Jesus, someone chasing you?

48:30.541 --> 48:31.976
Yeah, maybe.

48:36.547 --> 48:38.016
What are you doing here?

48:39.183 --> 48:40.451
I just came to check on you.

48:44.022 --> 48:46.090
You gonna let me inside or what?

48:48.159 --> 48:49.927
All right, yeah.

48:58.269 --> 48:59.337
Yeah.

49:00.338 --> 49:01.673
Here, this is--sit down.

49:01.706 --> 49:02.707
Yeah.

49:14.085 --> 49:16.721
So, uh, how are you?

49:18.356 --> 49:19.357
Fine.

49:20.591 --> 49:21.592
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

49:24.262 --> 49:25.530
You gonna tell me
what the fuck happened?

49:25.563 --> 49:26.698
No.

49:29.701 --> 49:31.336
I literally took
a bullet for you.

49:31.369 --> 49:33.171
It's the least you could do.

49:39.744 --> 49:43.481
I was suspended for having
sexual relations with a
confidential informant.

49:45.249 --> 49:47.151
What does that have to do
with Frankie Cuevas?

49:50.188 --> 49:51.255
She was his girl.

49:53.124 --> 49:55.093
- The hot stripper?
- Mm-hmm.

49:56.461 --> 49:58.429
What?

49:58.463 --> 50:00.631
Fuck, man, I didn't know
you had it in you.

50:00.665 --> 50:03.267
Hey, I'm not proud
of it, okay? And--

50:03.301 --> 50:05.303
Yeah, I mean, even I know
that's fucked up.

50:06.671 --> 50:08.139
You know,
they got meetings for that,

50:08.172 --> 50:09.774
Can't Keep It In Your Pants
Anonymous.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.109
We could go together.

50:13.077 --> 50:14.245
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

50:18.082 --> 50:20.118
- And what about Frankie?
- What about fucking Frankie?

50:20.151 --> 50:22.019
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Hey, chill out, man.

50:22.053 --> 50:24.122
I was just gonna say...

50:24.155 --> 50:25.323
we should shoot him.

50:28.626 --> 50:30.528
Yeah, we should do that.
That's a good idea.

50:32.130 --> 50:33.631
We're gonna have to use
your gun now, though.

50:36.234 --> 50:37.235
Yeah.

50:45.376 --> 50:47.044
Well, I got somewhere to be.

50:47.078 --> 50:48.546
Okay.

50:48.579 --> 50:50.047
You need a ride or anything?

50:51.382 --> 50:54.318
No, no.
I-I rented a car like a real
grown-up.

50:54.352 --> 50:55.620
- Oh, wow, look at you.
- Yeah.

50:55.653 --> 50:57.288
Huh.

50:58.222 --> 51:01.058
Listen, you-you need anything,
you let me know, okay?

51:02.093 --> 51:03.795
Yeah. No, I'm gonna be--
I'm gonna be fine.

51:05.696 --> 51:07.265
I've seen cops come back
from a lot worse.

51:07.298 --> 51:08.299
So...

51:10.468 --> 51:11.602
Yeah.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.228
This is a courtesy call,
letting you know that

52:44.262 --> 52:46.664
Frankie Cuevas
is being released today.

52:48.232 --> 52:50.868
I could probably help you too...

52:50.902 --> 52:52.803
if you're willing to play ball.

52:54.572 --> 52:56.207
I'm listening.

53:11.923 --> 53:14.825
Daddy!

53:17.261 --> 53:18.696
Huh?

53:24.302 --> 53:25.836
Can you hold this for Daddy?

53:50.561 --> 53:52.863
Come on.
We gotta catch the bus.

54:09.447 --> 54:12.683
Yo, Charmaine,
why can't we stay in New Beige?

54:12.717 --> 54:15.353
Wanna live with Auntie Ruth?

54:15.386 --> 54:16.887
I didn't think so.

54:18.556 --> 54:20.825
Besides, you heard
what Uncle said.

54:20.858 --> 54:22.393
People here are soft.

54:23.661 --> 54:26.831
Me and you,
we're gonna take over.
