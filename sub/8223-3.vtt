00:00.452 --> 00:02.153
Do not try
any of the experiments

00:02.154 --> 00:04.721
You are about to see
at home.

00:04.723 --> 00:07.125
You heard him --
don't do it.

00:07.126 --> 00:11.462
On this high-velocity episode
of "mythbusters"...

00:11.463 --> 00:13.264
I'm all oiled up
and ready to go.

00:13.265 --> 00:18.102
...Adam and jamie wreak
highway havoc in spy-car escape.

00:18.103 --> 00:19.771
You're not
gonna catch me!

00:19.772 --> 00:23.341
Just how difficult is it
to give your pursuer the slip...

00:23.342 --> 00:25.877
I got to say,
that's pretty effective.

00:25.878 --> 00:27.712
...With in-car weapons

00:27.713 --> 00:30.348
That always seem to work so well
in the movies?

00:30.349 --> 00:31.649
There it goes!
It's deployed!

00:31.650 --> 00:35.353
Then tory, grant, and kari
play hardball

00:35.354 --> 00:37.088
With the myth of momentum...

00:37.089 --> 00:38.523
We're gonna see that ball drop.

00:38.524 --> 00:40.525
...As they aim to find out

00:40.526 --> 00:43.394
If an object shot backwards
while traveling forwards...

00:43.395 --> 00:45.930
I feel like a gladiator
ready to be slaughtered.

00:45.931 --> 00:48.900
...Would really drop
straight to the ground.

00:48.901 --> 00:51.435
That was
a pretty good shot.

00:54.006 --> 00:55.640
Who are the mythbusters?

00:56.508 --> 00:57.642
Adam savage...

00:57.643 --> 00:59.110
You need to bring
some more power.

00:59.111 --> 01:00.778
...And jamie hyneman.

01:00.779 --> 01:02.947
Relax.
This won't hurt a bit.

01:02.948 --> 01:06.951
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:06.952 --> 01:09.287
We've got to keep her
afloat!

01:09.288 --> 01:12.156
Joining them --
tory belleci...

01:12.157 --> 01:13.591
Ã¢T?set it on fire Ã¢T?

01:14.793 --> 01:15.793
Burn!

01:15.794 --> 01:17.161
...And kari byron.

01:17.162 --> 01:18.229
Busting out of here,
see.

01:18.230 --> 01:20.865
They don't just tell
the myths.

01:20.866 --> 01:23.301
They put them to the test.

01:23.302 --> 01:33.304
-- <font color="#ffff00">Sync by l3ob@yyets/font>
www.addic7ed.com

01:34.813 --> 01:37.281
Check it out -- you know
we love our movie myths.

01:37.282 --> 01:40.218
And specifically, we love
our super-spy-movie myths.

01:40.219 --> 01:42.186
This next one
involves devices

01:42.187 --> 01:45.456
That a spy puts into their car
to instantly stop someone

01:45.457 --> 01:48.092
From following them
in a car-chase scenario.

01:48.093 --> 01:49.760
Ah.
Like a smoke screen.

01:49.761 --> 01:50.962
Exactly.

01:50.963 --> 01:52.997
And I'm thinking
we test all the classics --

01:52.998 --> 01:55.466
Smoke screen, and I'm thinking
releasing a bunch of tacks,

01:55.467 --> 01:57.301
And oil slick.

01:57.302 --> 01:59.604
Fast cars, dangerous gadgets --
I'm up for it.

01:59.605 --> 02:01.172
I thought you would be.

02:02.507 --> 02:06.143
The concept is almost as old
as the automobile itself --

02:06.144 --> 02:08.880
Arming a car
with the right kind of gadgets

02:08.881 --> 02:10.448
To ensure a slick getaway.

02:10.449 --> 02:11.816
Turn on the oil!

02:12.584 --> 02:17.622
The boys are revved up to test
three of the all-time classics

02:17.623 --> 02:21.292
In a series
of equally classic car chases.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.106
...Grant imahara...

02:22.661 --> 02:24.929
Uh, this is adam.
Could someone get me a car?

02:24.930 --> 02:28.132
This is jamie.
Make it sporty.

02:34.873 --> 02:35.973
Isn't that nice?

02:35.974 --> 02:37.808
That's cute.
Drive it on in.

02:37.809 --> 02:39.277
Okay.

02:41.914 --> 02:43.547
This is spy car one.

02:43.548 --> 02:46.350
Right now it's a normal car,
but when we're finished with it,

02:46.351 --> 02:48.819
It's gonna have all
the little tricks and gadgets

02:48.820 --> 02:51.489
That any self-respecting spy car
would have.

02:51.490 --> 02:52.490
This ought to do.

02:54.026 --> 02:56.093
So, it's straight down
to business,

02:56.094 --> 02:58.763
And the key word right now
is "deployment."

02:58.764 --> 03:01.766
Welcome to jamie's chop shop.

03:01.767 --> 03:03.701
All movie fans know

03:03.702 --> 03:06.370
That most weapons
are launched from the trunk,

03:06.371 --> 03:09.106
And a hole in the floor
with a sliding trapdoor

03:09.107 --> 03:10.274
Should fit the bill.

03:10.275 --> 03:12.043
Jamie's simple release

03:12.044 --> 03:15.513
Can be sprung
from a cord to the cockpit.

03:15.514 --> 03:17.081
It's not fancy...

03:17.082 --> 03:18.582
That ought to do it.

03:18.583 --> 03:21.052
...But it works.

03:21.053 --> 03:24.121
With the car customized,

03:24.122 --> 03:27.325
It's off to the test track
to load it with weapons.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.227
We're at the alameda county

03:30.228 --> 03:32.096
Emergency vehicle
operations center,

03:32.097 --> 03:35.366
Which is where the police
practice chasing bad guys,

03:35.367 --> 03:37.234
Which means it's perfect for us.

03:37.235 --> 03:40.604
Of course, there's
no chase without a chase car

03:40.605 --> 03:44.208
And an experienced daredevil
to drive it.

03:44.209 --> 03:45.509
Morning, sir.
Morning.

03:45.510 --> 03:47.111
How are you?
I'm good.
How are you?

03:47.112 --> 03:48.479
Good.
Good day for a car chase?

03:48.480 --> 03:50.081
Every day's a good day
for a car chase.

03:54.086 --> 03:56.587
What is it that makes brian
uniquely qualified

03:56.588 --> 03:58.122
To perform this test with us?

03:58.123 --> 04:01.092
I ask you to cast your mind back
to "driving in the rain,"

04:01.093 --> 04:03.861
Where brian hydroplaned
over 100 miles per hour

04:03.862 --> 04:06.030
And did a 720-degree turn.

04:06.031 --> 04:07.898
Look at the internal camera.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.334
That impassive face on him
is the face of confidence,

04:10.335 --> 04:12.670
And it is the face
that will lead this test for us.

04:12.671 --> 04:16.240
If we can evade him,
we can evad.Anybody.

04:16.241 --> 04:19.243
Escaping a driver
who's more skilled than you

04:19.244 --> 04:21.312
Means disabling his car.

04:21.313 --> 04:24.248
So, what's the first trick
in adam's trunk?

04:24.249 --> 04:25.783
<i>They may look friendly,</i>

04:25.784 --> 04:28.886
But these are 1/4-inch pieces
of hot-rolled steel

04:28.887 --> 04:32.056
Bent at right angles and welded
into a tetrahedral arrangement

04:32.057 --> 04:33.591
And then sharpened.

04:33.592 --> 04:37.695
These are roadspikes --
always have one point facing up.

04:37.696 --> 04:40.131
I think they're gonna be
highly effective

04:40.132 --> 04:43.234
When I drop them from
the back of the evading spy car.

04:43.235 --> 04:46.170
With over 100 of these
lethal little tire shredders,

04:46.171 --> 04:47.571
He might be right.

04:47.572 --> 04:50.474
But jamie also has a "point."

04:50.475 --> 04:51.709
Now, I have no doubt

04:51.710 --> 04:54.445
That these tacks
are gonna stick in the tires,

04:54.446 --> 04:57.248
But will they deflate the tires
quickly enough

04:57.249 --> 04:59.083
To keep our spy happy?

04:59.084 --> 05:01.485
I'm not so sure.

05:01.486 --> 05:05.790
Well, first, a quick check
on the rules of the chase.

05:05.791 --> 05:08.192
So, brian, what are
the iteria for escaping?

05:08.193 --> 05:10.528
If adam's able
to get far enough ahead of us

05:10.529 --> 05:12.763
That he actually loops
and gets behind us,

05:12.764 --> 05:13.931
Then he's gotten away.

05:13.932 --> 05:15.699
Also, if he makes
a turn on the course

05:15.700 --> 05:17.635
Someplace I don't catch
and then we end up taking

05:17.636 --> 05:19.970
A different turn
or different route,
then I've lost him.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.405
Okay, then.

05:21.406 --> 05:26.010
The cones are lined up to mark
out a long and winding road.

05:26.011 --> 05:28.145
And they're ready to rumble.

05:28.146 --> 05:30.648
Okay, this is
"spy car evasion techniques --

05:30.649 --> 05:31.882
The tacks."

05:31.883 --> 05:33.884
Eat...My...Dust.

05:39.291 --> 05:41.025
Make no mistake --

05:41.026 --> 05:44.228
Both drivers are hell-bent
on surviving the chase.

05:44.229 --> 05:46.530
Brian keeps
a respectful distance

05:46.531 --> 05:48.999
Of five or six car lengths.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.801
Hey, he's picking up
a little speed.

05:50.802 --> 05:53.003
Eventually,
right before a curve,

05:53.004 --> 05:55.840
Adam decides to drop his load.

05:56.942 --> 05:58.876
There we go.

05:58.877 --> 06:01.378
Despite
his considerable skill,

06:01.379 --> 06:04.815
Brian's going too fast
to avoid all the tacks.

06:04.816 --> 06:07.518
Yeah, they stuck in.
I can hear them.

06:07.519 --> 06:09.487
But at least for the moment,

06:09.488 --> 06:12.890
The chase car shows
no signs of losing momentum.

06:15.494 --> 06:19.163
We must have had
about a half a dozen
at least in there,

06:19.164 --> 06:21.565
And we're holding on
just fine.

06:21.566 --> 06:24.635
I wouldn't take corners
too fast in it, but...

06:24.636 --> 06:26.070
aah!

06:26.071 --> 06:28.639
Okay, we got you.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

06:30.308 --> 06:32.476
So, what happens?
Didn't --

06:32.477 --> 06:34.678
Oh! I got you!

06:34.679 --> 06:37.848
<i>Well, yo.Did,
but then you didn't.</i>

06:37.849 --> 06:39.283
The tacks
went into the tires,

06:39.284 --> 06:41.785
But we were on your tail
for several minutes afterwards.

06:41.786 --> 06:42.987
It didn't slow us down.

06:42.988 --> 06:45.156
I thought that as soon
as you hit the tacks,

06:45.157 --> 06:47.191
You'd be skidding off the road
immediately.

06:47.192 --> 06:49.326
I've got flat tires,
but you still didn't get away.

06:49.327 --> 06:50.594
No,
I didn't get away.

06:50.595 --> 06:52.296
Shoot. I wouldn't
have called that.

06:52.297 --> 06:54.465
The tacks eventually worked,

06:54.466 --> 06:56.700
But they took
their sweet time.

06:56.701 --> 06:58.335
And I'll say
one thing else --

06:58.336 --> 07:01.038
While I'm fagging
around on this course,
hell-bent for leather,

07:01.039 --> 07:03.240
It's really disconcerting
to look into my rearview mirror

07:03.241 --> 07:06.544
And see brian passively driving
after me like it's not --

07:06.545 --> 07:08.913
He's like a lion
playing with his food.

07:08.914 --> 07:10.915
Jamie thinks he knows

07:10.916 --> 07:14.351
Why the spikes kind of worked...
And kind o.Didn't.

07:14.352 --> 07:15.486
The problem with tacks

07:15.487 --> 07:17.588
Is that they plug the hole
that they create,

07:17.589 --> 07:19.657
And they don't let the air out
quick enough.

07:19.658 --> 07:21.959
Now, eventually,
sure, your tire's gonna deflate,

07:21.960 --> 07:23.727
But as far as a pursuit goes,

07:23.728 --> 07:26.096
You could hang on
for quite a while.

07:26.097 --> 07:29.934
As a quick-escape option,
the tacks didn't cut it.

07:29.935 --> 07:32.937
So it's on to phase 2
of the myth --

07:32.938 --> 07:36.273
Blinding the pursuer
in a cloud of smoke.

07:36.274 --> 07:38.976
Today, the role of smoke
in our little spy-car episode

07:38.977 --> 07:41.378
Is gonna be played
by a military smoke grenade.

07:41.379 --> 07:44.481
Now, we were offered the chance
to use a minimum-smoke grenade,

07:44.482 --> 07:45.983
But we said, "hell no!

07:45.984 --> 07:49.620
Give us 'maximum smoke --
military style.'"

07:49.621 --> 07:51.455
What does that look like?
I don't know.

07:51.456 --> 07:53.324
Let's check it out.

07:56.161 --> 07:57.561
Whoo!

07:57.562 --> 08:00.497
Providing
the wind doesn't pick up,

08:00.498 --> 08:02.399
That should work nicely.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.536
This rig
is about as simple as it gets.

08:05.537 --> 08:08.239
All you do is pull the pin,
you've got smoke.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.474
All I've done is strapped them

08:10.475 --> 08:12.543
To the back
of the inside of the car,

08:12.544 --> 08:14.078
I've hooked them up to cables

08:14.079 --> 08:16.313
That go into
the cockpit of the car,

08:16.314 --> 08:19.250
I pull on the cables --
I'm gone in a puff of smoke.

08:20.452 --> 08:22.486
Well, that's the theory.

08:22.487 --> 08:25.489
Okay, smoke evasion.
You guys ready?

08:25.490 --> 08:27.992
That's affirmative, lawbreaker.
Do your worst.

08:31.196 --> 08:33.364
Yah!

08:33.365 --> 08:34.999
Right from the get-go,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.869
Jamie sets a cracking pace
through the traffic cones.

08:40.972 --> 08:44.475
Brian has no idea
when to expect the smoke,

08:44.476 --> 08:46.410
But he doesn't have long
to wait.

08:51.082 --> 08:52.583
For the first few seconds,

08:52.584 --> 08:54.818
The deployment
looks picture-perfect.

08:56.421 --> 08:59.290
It's right about now
that it all goes horribly wrong,

08:59.291 --> 09:02.660
As jamie's convertible
starts filling with smoke.

09:04.296 --> 09:08.232
He misses the wall by a whisker,
and the chase is called off

09:08.233 --> 09:12.803
Before jamie
swallows more than his pride.

09:12.804 --> 09:14.705
I think
he has to get out.

09:14.706 --> 09:17.908
yeah, I think so, too.

09:18.977 --> 09:21.245
You okay?

09:22.647 --> 09:25.482
Can we get some water over here
for jamie right away?

09:25.483 --> 09:28.485
This smoke
has gone literally everywhere.

09:28.486 --> 09:32.256
It's coming out of every nook
and cranny of this car.

09:32.257 --> 09:34.291
Whoa!

09:34.292 --> 09:37.027
Well, that right there was
a real "pink panther" moment.

09:37.028 --> 09:39.797
I mean, we build these things,
and, ideally,

09:39.798 --> 09:42.566
We test them before we take them
out on the road, but...

09:43.902 --> 09:47.004
I kind of regret not doing that.

09:47.005 --> 09:49.340
That was absolutely horrible.

09:49.341 --> 09:53.143
With the rushing air pushed
over and around the windscreen,

09:53.144 --> 09:56.080
The car's interior
became a low-pressure zone,

09:56.081 --> 09:59.149
Sucking much of the smoke
back up over the trunk.

10:00.418 --> 10:02.853
That's a rig failure,
not a technique failure.

10:02.854 --> 10:05.489
We're gonna have to reset
and try it again.

10:05.490 --> 10:06.990
Adam's right.

10:06.991 --> 10:10.361
It's unfair to condemn a myth
due to faulty method.

10:10.362 --> 10:12.696
We'll reassess and reload

10:12.697 --> 10:14.732
To hopefully
make the convertible cockpit

10:14.733 --> 10:17.601
A smoke-free zone.

10:17.602 --> 10:20.371
After the break,
kari, grant, and tory

10:20.372 --> 10:23.774
Take a treadmill walk
on the wild side.

10:23.775 --> 10:24.775
Ready?

10:24.776 --> 10:26.143
I'm ready
as I'm ever gonna be.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:40.480 --> 10:41.880
So, what are you
so excited about?

10:41.881 --> 10:45.050
Well, it's our turn
to try a new type of myth --

10:45.051 --> 10:46.752
The physics
thought experiment.

10:46.753 --> 10:48.988
Great -- something to get
the ol' gray matter working.

10:48.989 --> 10:50.823
So, here's how
this one goes.

10:50.824 --> 10:53.859
Let's say you're driving along
in a car at "x" miles an hour.

10:53.860 --> 10:55.661
You throw something
out the back

10:55.662 --> 10:57.963
In the opposite direction
at the same speed.

10:57.964 --> 10:59.498
Does it just fall
straight down?

10:59.499 --> 11:00.966
Basically
what you're saying --

11:00.967 --> 11:03.135
Does the forward momentum
and the backward momentum

11:03.136 --> 11:04.670
Cancel each other out
completely?

11:04.671 --> 11:05.838
Exactly.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.040
Or is there some other factor,
like air resistance,

11:08.041 --> 11:09.308
That makes it
impossible?

11:09.309 --> 11:11.276
And I wonder, if it works
at 6 miles an hour,

11:11.277 --> 11:12.478
Will it also work
at 60?

11:12.479 --> 11:14.580
That is
what we're gonna find out.

11:14.581 --> 11:15.948
It makes sense

11:15.949 --> 11:19.618
That an object subjected
to equal and opposite forces,

11:19.619 --> 11:23.188
<i>Forwards an backwards,
would drop like a stone.</i>

11:23.189 --> 11:25.591
But unless we can prove it
in real life,

11:25.592 --> 11:29.795
This simple equation's
no more than an untested myth.

11:29.796 --> 11:31.196
So, how are we
gonna test this one?

11:31.197 --> 11:33.098
How about a pickup truck
with a treadmill on the back?

11:33.099 --> 11:35.267
Pickup truck drive.Forward
at 10 miles an hour,

11:35.268 --> 11:37.069
<i>Treadmill goes back
at 10 miles an hour,</i>

11:37.070 --> 11:38.671
And then one of us
jumps on it.

11:38.672 --> 11:39.972
By "one of us,"
you mean tory?

11:39.973 --> 11:41.173
What?

11:41.174 --> 11:43.042
So this is to see
if I just fall straight down

11:43.043 --> 11:44.209
Or get flung
off the back?

11:44.210 --> 11:45.277
That's the idea.

11:45.278 --> 11:47.446
Yeah. Great idea.

11:47.447 --> 11:49.581
Best if they bust out
the gym equipment

11:49.582 --> 11:52.184
Before tory changes his mind.

11:52.185 --> 11:53.652
That seems safe enough.

11:53.653 --> 11:56.155
Normally, treadmills are
pretty straightforward.

11:56.156 --> 11:57.856
You set the speed and go.

11:57.857 --> 12:00.259
That is, of course,
if you haven't been drinking.

12:00.260 --> 12:02.494
As adam bravely proved,

12:02.495 --> 12:05.130
The treadmill
is not to be trifled with.

12:05.131 --> 12:08.434
And now it's tory's turn.

12:08.435 --> 12:11.937
My question is, if he jumps
onto a moving treadmill,

12:11.938 --> 12:15.641
Will it slow down and actually
throw him off at a slower speed?

12:15.642 --> 12:16.909
To test this,

12:16.910 --> 12:20.012
We're gonna put a 180-pound load
onto the treadmill,

12:20.013 --> 12:21.213
See if it slows down.

12:21.214 --> 12:23.182
If it does,
then we'll turn it up

12:23.183 --> 12:26.018
Until it throws it off
at the target speed.

12:26.019 --> 12:27.486
According to the manual,

12:27.487 --> 12:30.856
The maximum speed of the
treadmill is 10 miles per hour.

12:30.857 --> 12:33.959
That's fast enough
to get the stripes strobing.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.128
That looks
a little crazy to me.

12:36.129 --> 12:37.963
<i>It looks a lo crazy.</i>

12:37.964 --> 12:39.364
That looks
so dangerous,

12:39.365 --> 12:41.400
I would not want
to try to jump on that.

12:41.401 --> 12:44.436
And, at least for the moment,
he doesn't.

12:46.740 --> 12:48.841
Ah. That was
kind of a problem.

12:48.842 --> 12:51.410
In fact, it was
just what grant predicted.

12:51.411 --> 12:54.947
The bag slowed the belt down
to a relative crawl.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.548
It actually recovers
fairly quickly.

12:56.549 --> 12:57.783
Okay.

12:57.784 --> 13:01.453
And it gets back up to...
5.45 miles per hour.

13:01.454 --> 13:05.057
All right. Now the tricky part
is doing it without falling.

13:05.058 --> 13:07.126
I suggest
you tuck and roll.

13:07.127 --> 13:08.761
So, to balance the myth,

13:08.762 --> 13:10.662
The truck
should also move forwards

13:10.663 --> 13:13.699
At 5 1/2 miles per hour.

13:13.700 --> 13:16.435
All that remains
is to attach one to the other.

13:16.436 --> 13:18.437
You're really gonna run
on this thing, huh?

13:18.438 --> 13:22.875
Oh, not so much run --
more just fly off the back.

13:22.876 --> 13:24.143
Four bolts later,

13:24.144 --> 13:28.046
This traveling treadmill
is primed for a field trip.

13:29.449 --> 13:32.317
They're bound for the
concord naval weapons station,

13:32.318 --> 13:34.987
<i>Where the roads
are long an level.</i>

13:34.988 --> 13:37.189
That's not
going anywhere.

13:37.190 --> 13:38.323
No, that's good.

13:38.324 --> 13:40.793
<i>It should be real safe --
real safe.</i>

13:40.794 --> 13:44.396
That would be the least
of our safety concerns, I think.

13:44.397 --> 13:47.566
Tory straps on
the famous red suit.

13:47.567 --> 13:51.069
Kari still can't understand
why his kneepads are trembling.

13:51.070 --> 13:52.738
You got dragged
by a horse,

13:52.739 --> 13:55.040
And it didn't seem
like a bad idea.

13:55.041 --> 13:57.376
You got buried alive --
didn't seem like a bad idea.

13:57.377 --> 13:59.144
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop! Stop!

13:59.145 --> 14:00.479
You got in a ring
with a bull.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.948
It didn't seem
like a bad idea.

14:02.949 --> 14:04.249
He was looking
right at me.

14:04.250 --> 14:05.951
This is a bad idea?

14:05.952 --> 14:09.321
I feel like a gladiator
ready to be slaughtered.

14:09.322 --> 14:12.524
We'll chalk that one
up as a "yes."

14:12.525 --> 14:14.393
Okay, so, here's the setup.

14:14.394 --> 14:16.829
For our control test, our truck
is going to be stationary.

14:16.830 --> 14:18.564
Tory's going to drop
onto the treadmill

14:18.565 --> 14:21.099
And then project off the end
of the truck in a gentle arc.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.001
Okay, so,
this is our control test.

14:23.002 --> 14:24.002
You ready?

14:24.003 --> 14:25.838
I'm ready
as I'm ever gonna be.

14:25.839 --> 14:26.839
Okay.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.607
Famous last words,

14:28.608 --> 14:31.944
As a telephone call
disrupts the filming.

14:33.479 --> 14:35.781
Ahh!
Who is it?

14:37.217 --> 14:39.885
Yeah, look, uh, the
insurance company said, uh...

14:39.886 --> 14:41.653
This is brian.
He's our director.

14:41.654 --> 14:43.021
You should
know better.

14:43.022 --> 14:44.189
Yeah, I know.

14:44.190 --> 14:46.358
What's going on?

14:46.359 --> 14:49.761
With uncanny timing,
the office has called up

14:49.762 --> 14:52.564
To tell them
that tor.Canno take the fall.

14:52.565 --> 14:54.566
Okay, so, this is unusual.

14:54.567 --> 14:56.568
We're just about to go for it,

14:56.569 --> 15:00.072
And our producer gets
a phone call from the insurers.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.908
Apparently,
this I.Way too dangerous

15:02.909 --> 15:06.345
For tory to attempt --
this uncontrollable fall.

15:06.346 --> 15:09.481
So, I think we're gonna have to
go for the next-best thing,

15:09.482 --> 15:12.351
Which is -- I don't know --
like, sandbags or something.

15:12.352 --> 15:14.453
So, while tory stands down,

15:14.454 --> 15:17.589
The supply truck is ransacked
for raw materials.

15:17.590 --> 15:19.258
Okay,
what do we got?

15:19.259 --> 15:22.361
They're looking to build
a substitute fall guy,

15:22.362 --> 15:25.831
So coveralls and a blow-up doll
fit the bill.

15:25.832 --> 15:28.834
How's that? Is it getting
into the legs at all?

15:28.835 --> 15:30.903
Oh, it is.
It's getting heavy.

15:30.904 --> 15:34.473
And there's a real bonus to
having a sand-filled stand-in.

15:34.474 --> 15:37.709
They can fill it to just
a fraction of tory's weight.

15:37.710 --> 15:40.646
<i>So they can run their tests
at 10 miles per hour,</i>

15:40.647 --> 15:42.881
Not the planned 5.

15:42.882 --> 15:44.783
Not bad
for a stand-in tory.

15:44.784 --> 15:48.120
It's only fitting
that the man who missed out

15:48.121 --> 15:50.555
Gets to discharge
his stunt double.

15:50.556 --> 15:54.026
all right,
here we go -- 10 miles an hour.

15:54.027 --> 15:58.196
In 3...2...1.

15:58.197 --> 15:59.431
Ohh!

15:59.432 --> 16:02.034
I am so glad
that that wasn't you, man.

16:02.035 --> 16:04.970
<i>That was an arc.
I wouldn't say a gentle arc.</i>

16:04.971 --> 16:06.138
Nor would we.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.940
And it's probably time to admit

16:07.941 --> 16:09.808
That the safety team
had a fair point.

16:09.809 --> 16:11.410
During our control test,

16:11.411 --> 16:13.979
Stand-in tory was thrown
6 feet away from the treadmill

16:13.980 --> 16:15.781
From a height of 3 1/2 feet.

16:15.782 --> 16:18.417
What this means is,
he didn't fall straight down.

16:18.418 --> 16:20.319
But that's not a surprise.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.387
Now it's time to move on.

16:23.823 --> 16:25.490
Okay, this is the main test.

16:25.491 --> 16:28.493
I'm going to drive the pickup
at 10 miles an hour

16:28.494 --> 16:31.196
While tory throws his "sand-in"
onto the treadmill

16:31.197 --> 16:33.498
Right in front
of the high-speed cameras.

16:33.499 --> 16:35.968
If the sack of sand
comes even close

16:35.969 --> 16:37.869
To falling
straight to the ground,

16:37.870 --> 16:40.405
We'll finally know
that this myth is on track.

16:41.874 --> 16:43.308
It's a rare case

16:43.309 --> 16:46.845
<i>Where the team gets excited
by a lack of spectacle.</i>

16:47.847 --> 16:50.849
Still,
best check the high-speed.

16:50.850 --> 16:53.785
So, watch that point
right there.

16:53.786 --> 16:56.388
Oh, nice timing
on the drop.

16:56.389 --> 16:57.389
Ohh!

16:57.390 --> 16:59.324
It pretty much dropped
straight down!

16:59.325 --> 17:01.460
I mean, compared
to our control test,

17:01.461 --> 17:03.261
It would have been
out there.

17:03.262 --> 17:05.097
Here -- psht! --
Straight down.

17:05.098 --> 17:06.698
That is really cool.

17:06.699 --> 17:09.568
So there might be some merit
to this myth.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.902
Absolutely.

17:10.903 --> 17:13.672
The morning's testing
was a total success,

17:13.673 --> 17:15.973
And they learned something
along the way.

17:15.974 --> 17:17.376
First of all,

17:17.377 --> 17:19.678
We learned that tory is
more important than we thought.

17:19.679 --> 17:21.747
We can't just chuck him
off the back of a truck.

17:21.748 --> 17:24.281
Secondly, we learned something
from our 10-mile-an-hour test.

17:24.282 --> 17:26.284
We had the treadmill
going at 10 miles an hour

17:26.285 --> 17:27.786
On a stationary truck.

17:27.787 --> 17:31.289
We dropped our "sand-in" tory,
and he fell in a little arc.

17:31.290 --> 17:33.625
Then we drove
exactly 10 miles an hour,

17:33.626 --> 17:36.695
Dropped our sand-in tory
in the same position,

17:36.696 --> 17:39.398
And he went straight down.

17:39.399 --> 17:43.368
But this is "mythbusters,"
and we just can't stop there.

17:46.339 --> 17:48.040
Coming up,

17:48.041 --> 17:50.675
Adam and jamie look
for satisfaction in traction.

17:50.676 --> 17:52.778
I got to say,
that's pretty effective.

17:58.757 --> 18:00.758
So far, the spikes are a bust...

18:00.759 --> 18:02.326
They stuck in.

18:02.327 --> 18:05.463
...And the smoke is a "maybe"
in our spy-car evasion myth.

18:07.566 --> 18:11.669
Given that jamie almost gassed
himself first time around,

18:11.670 --> 18:13.237
He's made some modifications.

18:13.238 --> 18:15.673
I didn't like
inhaling all that smoke,

18:15.674 --> 18:17.374
So I've done a couple of things.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.376
The first is
that I've put the smoke bombs

18:19.377 --> 18:21.078
Out away from the car,

18:21.079 --> 18:24.081
And the second is,
adam's gonna drive.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.618
So the scene is set

18:27.619 --> 18:31.188
For a smarter
and healthier smoke screen.

18:31.189 --> 18:33.157
All right, jamie,
are you ready?

18:33.158 --> 18:34.458
We're ready.

18:34.459 --> 18:35.626
Okay.

18:35.627 --> 18:38.395
Eat my smoke!

18:40.265 --> 18:42.466
Adam leads brian
on a merry chase...

18:43.568 --> 18:45.202
You know,
this is pretty fun.

18:45.203 --> 18:48.372
...Till the time comes to pull
the pin on those twin grenades.

18:49.808 --> 18:50.808
Oh, there we go.

18:54.246 --> 18:56.313
I got to say,
that's pretty effective.

18:57.616 --> 19:00.117
The smoke comes thick and fast

19:00.118 --> 19:03.020
As the chase car slows
to a crawl...

19:03.021 --> 19:04.588
Oh.

19:04.589 --> 19:07.424
...And adam actually
starts to catch up.

19:12.364 --> 19:15.499
With the red car
now in brian's rearview mirror,

19:15.500 --> 19:18.269
Adam's officially
shaken his tail.

19:22.173 --> 19:24.542
Whoo!

19:26.411 --> 19:28.512
I think that's a win!

19:29.648 --> 19:30.714
Good job.

19:30.715 --> 19:32.182
That was awesome!

19:32.183 --> 19:34.618
At one point,
I looked over,

19:34.619 --> 19:37.521
And jamie and brian were
all the way across the course.

19:37.522 --> 19:39.723
At that point,
I figured I had it.

19:39.724 --> 19:42.459
With one crucial adjustment,

19:42.460 --> 19:44.929
The smoke screen worked
big-time.

19:44.930 --> 19:46.730
Now to move on to a test

19:46.731 --> 19:49.633
That should push brian's skills
to the limit.

19:49.634 --> 19:51.535
We know this is good
for the taste buds

19:51.536 --> 19:52.736
And bad for the waistline.

19:52.737 --> 19:53.971
The question is,

19:53.972 --> 19:57.207
Is it good for the escapee
and bad for the pursuer?

19:57.208 --> 19:59.743
I think it will be.

19:59.744 --> 20:03.581
As adam implied, w.Are doing
our best to save the planet.

20:03.582 --> 20:07.017
<i>The lubricant of choice
is vegetabl oil.</i>

20:07.018 --> 20:10.054
Okay, guys, I'm all oiled up
and ready to go.

20:10.055 --> 20:11.221
Ar.You ready?

20:11.222 --> 20:12.923
We're ready. Yes.

20:14.292 --> 20:15.559
This should be slick.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.896
Knowing what's coming

20:18.897 --> 20:21.265
Won't help brian
avoid a potential disaster.

20:21.266 --> 20:24.868
The course is too narrow
to skirt around the slick,

20:24.869 --> 20:27.571
And he doesn't know
where or when

20:27.572 --> 20:29.006
Jamie plans
to give him the slip.

20:31.409 --> 20:33.577
And then we see oil
pour out of his back,

20:33.578 --> 20:34.979
And brian tries to avoid it,

20:34.980 --> 20:37.348
But actually,
because jamie does it on a turn,

20:37.349 --> 20:40.484
It sort of crosses the whole
road, and we can't avoid it.

20:40.485 --> 20:42.820
The chase car
has clearly lost traction.

20:42.821 --> 20:46.490
It slips and it slides
as brian struggles

20:46.491 --> 20:49.059
To point the nose forward
and stay on the track.

20:49.060 --> 20:50.594
Definitely
made it slick.

20:50.595 --> 20:52.329
yes, definitely.

20:52.330 --> 20:56.000
He's lost valuable time
as the car careens sideways,

20:56.001 --> 20:59.570
And jamie decides to quit
while he's ahead.

20:59.571 --> 21:02.206
At speed,
the rig worked perfectly.

21:02.207 --> 21:05.943
Unfortunately, it didn't
cause us to totally spin out

21:05.944 --> 21:07.911
And lose control of our car.

21:07.912 --> 21:09.346
Jamie did get far ahead,

21:09.347 --> 21:11.715
But brian was able
to stay on the road.

21:11.716 --> 21:13.584
So, where does that leave us
overall?

21:13.585 --> 21:15.052
Well,
let's tally them up.

21:15.053 --> 21:16.587
Tacks.
Busted.

21:16.588 --> 21:17.755
Smoke screen.

21:17.756 --> 21:18.756
Confirmed.

21:18.757 --> 21:19.757
Oil slick.

21:19.758 --> 21:21.125
Somewhere
in the middle.

21:21.126 --> 21:22.926
I agree --
somewhere in the middle.

21:22.927 --> 21:24.595
All right,
let's get out of here,

21:24.596 --> 21:27.297
And, uh,
slowly, please.

21:27.298 --> 21:31.635
That's three classic evasion
techniques done and dusted.

21:31.636 --> 21:32.903
Whoa! Hey!

21:32.904 --> 21:36.140
But they're having
way too much fun to stop here.

21:41.780 --> 21:44.648
Kari, grant, and tory
are trying to confirm the myth

21:44.649 --> 21:47.117
That a deadweight
drops straight to the ground

21:47.118 --> 21:49.019
If its forward momentum

21:49.020 --> 21:52.089
Is exactly the same
as its backwards propulsion.

21:52.090 --> 21:57.061
So far, a mobile treadmill
seems to have proved the point.

21:57.062 --> 21:59.163
True, but you know the fans
are never gonna be happy

21:59.164 --> 22:00.297
If we stop right there.

22:00.298 --> 22:01.732
<i>We have to test this
at higher speeds.</i>

22:01.733 --> 22:03.467
All right,
why don't we ramp it up?

22:03.468 --> 22:04.635
We'll build
an air cannon,

22:04.636 --> 22:06.203
Fire a soccer ball
at 60 miles an hour.

22:06.204 --> 22:08.005
We'll do it again
inside of a moving vehicle

22:08.006 --> 22:09.173
Going 60 miles an hour,

22:09.174 --> 22:10.808
See if the energies
cancel each other out

22:10.809 --> 22:12.009
And we get
a vertical drop.

22:12.010 --> 22:13.510
Love it.
Let's do it.

22:13.511 --> 22:16.313
Grant gets the task
of building the cannon,

22:16.314 --> 22:19.283
And he's not one
for half measures.

22:19.284 --> 22:22.252
This is our next step
in testing this myth.

22:22.253 --> 22:25.289
It's the barrel of the largest
air cannon I have ever built.

22:26.124 --> 22:28.759
Okay, here we go.
9 p.S.I.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.829
In 3...2...1.

22:31.830 --> 22:33.063
Whoo!

22:33.064 --> 22:36.233
Yep, that looked like
60 miles an hour to me.

22:36.234 --> 22:39.636
And a check of the high-speed
confirms the call.

22:41.039 --> 22:43.040
The good news is
that we have our number.

22:43.041 --> 22:47.478
We now know that 9 p.S.I.
Equals 60 miles an hour

22:47.479 --> 22:49.146
Out of the barrel.

22:49.147 --> 22:50.280
Perfect.
Great.

22:50.281 --> 22:51.448
That's our target speed.

22:51.449 --> 22:52.683
All right.
We're there.

22:52.684 --> 22:54.118
Well, almost.

22:54.119 --> 22:55.419
It's now back to concord

22:55.420 --> 22:57.821
To see if they've got
the balance just right.

22:57.822 --> 22:59.923
All right.

22:59.924 --> 23:03.560
Time to give this experiment
a shot of steroids.

23:03.561 --> 23:06.563
Logistically, this is going to
be a very difficult experiment.

23:06.564 --> 23:08.065
Everything has to come together

23:08.066 --> 23:10.434
For it to actually
yield the results we want.

23:10.435 --> 23:12.603
I mean,
the small scale was brilliant.

23:12.604 --> 23:15.973
If we can get anywhere
close to that, I would be happy.

23:15.974 --> 23:20.077
But tory's already anticipating
trouble down the road.

23:20.078 --> 23:23.080
My feeling is, grant's gonna
prematurely hit that button

23:23.081 --> 23:25.482
And the soccer ball is
not actually gonna make it

23:25.483 --> 23:27.351
In the high-speed shot.

23:27.352 --> 23:28.919
We'll see what happens.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.154
All right,
you guys ready?

23:30.155 --> 23:31.855
Cannon is armed,
and truck is in place.

23:31.856 --> 23:33.290
We're ready
on your "go," tory.

23:33.291 --> 23:34.958
Hit it.

23:37.095 --> 23:38.529
20...

23:38.530 --> 23:39.630
30...

23:39.631 --> 23:40.764
40...

23:40.765 --> 23:42.866
50...

23:42.867 --> 23:44.535
Come on.
Get to 60.

23:44.536 --> 23:45.936
Come on.

23:45.937 --> 23:47.204
Okay.

23:48.439 --> 23:50.574
And...Fire.

23:50.575 --> 23:51.875
Hey!

23:51.876 --> 23:54.344
That was
a pretty good shot.

23:54.345 --> 23:56.180
Let's look
at the high-speed.

23:56.181 --> 23:58.515
Given how hard this is
to get right,

23:58.516 --> 23:59.950
It's a mighty first effort.

23:59.951 --> 24:02.786
<i>But the ball
did bounce backwards.</i>

24:05.857 --> 24:07.057
It's not perfect.

24:07.058 --> 24:08.992
It's not the same results
as the other one.

24:08.993 --> 24:10.427
That's what I'm saying.

24:10.428 --> 24:12.963
This should drop straight down,
not fly backwards.

24:12.964 --> 24:14.565
It's agreed

24:14.566 --> 24:18.001
That either the car was too slow
or the cannon too fast.

24:18.002 --> 24:20.838
The afternoon rolls on
as a series of runs...

24:20.839 --> 24:23.307
The ball did not drop
straight down.

24:24.475 --> 24:27.177
...Never quite
seem to hit the mark.

24:27.178 --> 24:28.278
Looking good!

24:29.414 --> 24:31.949
And...He fired it too soon.

24:31.950 --> 24:35.085
But the ball
still bounce.Backwards.

24:35.086 --> 24:39.122
25 attempts later,
they haven't come close

24:39.123 --> 24:41.825
To seeing the soccer ball
drop like a stone.

24:41.826 --> 24:43.794
Some even bounce.Forwards,

24:43.795 --> 24:46.530
And it could be the cannon,
the car,

24:46.531 --> 24:48.699
Or the myth that's at fault.

24:48.700 --> 24:52.035
We could be out here all day
and not get a result.

24:52.036 --> 24:55.439
This might be the time
to rethink their approach.

24:55.440 --> 24:59.576
After all, no one said
science was meant to be easy.

25:00.545 --> 25:02.179
Up next...

25:02.180 --> 25:03.914
Jamie and adam
take on each other

25:03.915 --> 25:07.017
In a head-to-head
spy-car challenge.

25:07.018 --> 25:08.685
That ought to do it.

25:11.666 --> 25:14.200
Please do not try what we do
on this show at home.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.922
We're what you call
experts.

25:16.227 --> 25:17.661
It's safer
that way.

25:20.331 --> 25:22.299
Adam and jamie
have already tested

25:22.300 --> 25:26.303
Three classic
spy-car-evasion techniques --

25:26.304 --> 25:30.907
Tacks, smoke,
and a 10-gallon oil slick.

25:32.443 --> 25:35.211
And the best way
to keep the thrills coming

25:35.212 --> 25:38.081
Is getting our two spies
to take on each other

25:38.082 --> 25:41.251
With weapons
they'll both build from scratch.

25:41.252 --> 25:42.519
Pop quiz.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.387
What do you see
here on the table?

25:44.388 --> 25:47.023
<i>Yo may see a random collection
of plumbing parts.</i>

25:47.024 --> 25:51.895
<i>See the next evolution
in spy-evasion technology.</i>

25:52.897 --> 25:54.331
Ow!

25:54.332 --> 25:56.466
If you think adam's
being deliberately obscure,

25:56.467 --> 25:58.335
Get a load of jamie.

25:58.336 --> 26:01.037
You know what they say -- "the
best defense is a good offense."

26:01.038 --> 26:02.839
Well, I figure
I'm gonna make something

26:02.840 --> 26:05.809
That I can take
right to the pursuer's car,

26:05.810 --> 26:08.845
Deliver it point-blank,
and take him out.

26:08.846 --> 26:11.915
Ensuring
their secrets remain just that,

26:11.916 --> 26:14.250
A huge curtain
didivides the workshop.

26:14.251 --> 26:17.420
While adam assembles
what looks and sounds like

26:17.421 --> 26:19.623
A prototype
space-shuttle toilet...

26:20.825 --> 26:23.893
...Jamie gets low-down nasty.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.097
Yeah, baby.

26:27.098 --> 26:29.099
That thing starts to dig in,

26:29.100 --> 26:31.601
We got some trouble
on our hands.

26:33.037 --> 26:35.038
It's clear from the outset

26:35.039 --> 26:37.173
This mystery rig
will be heavy-duty,

26:37.174 --> 26:40.977
As gear teeth are cut
into chromoly steel

26:40.978 --> 26:43.013
With a plasma torch.

26:43.014 --> 26:45.715
Whatever he's building,
it's a safe bet

26:45.716 --> 26:48.118
This would get you suspended
from metal shop.

26:50.054 --> 26:51.588
That ought to do it.

26:51.589 --> 26:54.557
After hours
of diligent, diabolical labor,

26:54.558 --> 26:57.761
Jamie's finally
up for some show-and-tell.

26:57.762 --> 27:01.264
I made this relatively
simple-looking little thing

27:01.265 --> 27:02.866
Out of chromoly steel,

27:02.867 --> 27:06.736
And it's flat enough
to mount underneath my car,

27:06.737 --> 27:08.805
Out of sight and out of mind.

27:08.806 --> 27:10.807
But it's gonna be mounted
in a gun,

27:10.808 --> 27:13.677
And I'm gonna drive up
to the pursuer's car,

27:13.678 --> 27:15.445
<i>Fire this from under my car,</i>

27:15.446 --> 27:18.114
<i>Right over the ground,
to under thei car,</i>

27:18.115 --> 27:22.018
At which point, it changes,
and it goes...Like that.

27:22.019 --> 27:24.187
If it works on the day,

27:24.188 --> 27:26.656
That's a bona-fide car crippler.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.561
Yeah.

27:31.562 --> 27:34.864
Adam, meantime,
has take.His show on the road.

27:34.865 --> 27:36.499
In a radical twist,

27:36.500 --> 27:40.303
It looks like he's trying
to slow himself down.

27:40.304 --> 27:42.472
That's promising, right there.

27:42.473 --> 27:45.108
The idea
is to shut down the chase car

27:45.109 --> 27:47.110
With a parachute blindfold

27:47.111 --> 27:49.879
Launched from
that strange plumbing project.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.682
He'll cut the rig loose
when it's caught enough air,

27:52.683 --> 27:54.484
The main chute deployed

27:54.485 --> 27:57.153
By a much smaller one,
called a drogue.

27:57.154 --> 28:01.624
I'm gonna try throwing this out
as I drive

28:01.625 --> 28:05.929
And see if that launches
this parachute for me.

28:05.930 --> 28:07.864
Adam takes off,

28:07.865 --> 28:10.166
And short of cutting loose
the big chute,

28:10.167 --> 28:11.568
The test seems to work.

28:15.406 --> 28:16.606
Ohh!

28:17.608 --> 28:19.409
Ow!

28:19.410 --> 28:21.244
Okay.

28:21.245 --> 28:22.278
Ow!

28:22.279 --> 28:23.880
The parachute launched

28:23.881 --> 28:26.883
And immediately ripped this
off the trunk

28:26.884 --> 28:28.551
And sent it into my head.

28:31.021 --> 28:32.722
But I like the drogue chute.

28:32.723 --> 28:34.858
It seems like
a nice, quick deploy.

28:34.859 --> 28:38.595
While adam untangles,
jamie just adds to his arsenal.

28:38.596 --> 28:42.766
How this one fits in
is anyone's guess.

28:42.767 --> 28:44.534
It's still smoking.

28:44.535 --> 28:48.905
But hi.Rea party piece
is the auto stop 3000,

28:48.906 --> 28:51.241
Installed in a tube
welded under the chassis.

28:51.242 --> 28:53.009
When I pull this trigger,

28:53.010 --> 28:55.044
The pressurized air
that's in this tank

28:55.045 --> 28:57.480
Goes through the valve,
out the bottom of the car,

28:57.481 --> 28:59.115
And out the barrel.

29:01.552 --> 29:05.321
And so the air from the car
has shot this whole assembly

29:05.322 --> 29:07.190
Out the bottom o.Thi car,

29:07.191 --> 29:10.493
<i>Aimed for the bottom
of the neighborin car.</i>

29:10.494 --> 29:12.962
That would be a successful test.

29:12.963 --> 29:17.934
Adam's also been busy,
uh, customizing his rear end.

29:17.935 --> 29:19.969
Then, just
to rattle jamie's cage...

29:19.970 --> 29:24.107
Yeah, bring in all the puppies
and all the lead.

29:24.108 --> 29:27.277
On that disturbing note,
it's time to return

29:27.278 --> 29:30.246
To a favorite
"mythbusters" test track --

29:30.247 --> 29:33.583
This abandoned suburb
at fort ord.

29:35.019 --> 29:36.786
Are you ready for this?

29:36.787 --> 29:37.887
I'm ready.

29:37.888 --> 29:39.022
I'm gonna go first,

29:39.023 --> 29:41.024
'cause I don't think
you can handle my technique!

29:41.025 --> 29:42.292
Knock yourself out.

29:44.461 --> 29:45.829
Okay, here's my plan.

29:45.830 --> 29:48.031
Right about here, I'm going to
push the launch switch,

29:48.032 --> 29:49.199
Activating the cannon,

29:49.200 --> 29:51.034
Setting the drogue chute out
behind my car.

29:51.035 --> 29:53.069
At this point, brian and jamie
are likely to wonder

29:53.070 --> 29:54.270
What the hell's going on,

29:54.271 --> 29:55.872
And they're likely
to back off a little bit.

29:55.873 --> 29:57.707
It'll take the drogue chute
a little while

29:57.708 --> 29:59.008
To fully inflate the parachute.

29:59.009 --> 30:00.410
Right about here, in fact.

30:00.411 --> 30:03.279
At that point, brian and jamie
are likely to be wondering

30:03.280 --> 30:06.349
What the hell I'm doing slowing
myself down with a parachute.

30:06.350 --> 30:08.585
And this is where I activate
the final part of my plan,

30:08.586 --> 30:12.488
Which is to cut the cord that
holds the parachute to my car.

30:12.489 --> 30:14.991
They will either, "a,"
get entangled in the parachute

30:14.992 --> 30:17.961
<i>Or, "b," figure that because the
parachute stopped, I've stopped</i>

30:17.962 --> 30:19.128
An.The will stop.

30:19.129 --> 30:21.030
Meanwhile...

30:21.031 --> 30:23.299
I will have pulled into
my secret hiding place

30:23.300 --> 30:24.534
Out of sight of the road,

30:24.535 --> 30:26.269
Sending them
down the wrong road,

30:26.270 --> 30:28.037
Looking for me
in the wrong place.

30:28.038 --> 30:30.273
I think
it's a pretty sound plan.

30:30.274 --> 30:31.574
I think it'll work.

30:32.710 --> 30:35.411
Let's remember
that jamie hasn't a clue

30:35.412 --> 30:38.848
That the plan is to blind him
with billows of nylon.

30:38.849 --> 30:40.750
Nothing to see here, folks.

30:41.819 --> 30:43.286
Are you guys ready?

30:43.287 --> 30:44.787
We're all set.

30:44.788 --> 30:45.788
Okay.

30:45.789 --> 30:47.557
Eat...My...Dust.

30:49.560 --> 30:52.195
Adam takes off
like a shell from a shotgun.

30:52.196 --> 30:54.998
Once again,
brian's steering the chase car.

30:58.969 --> 31:01.738
These streets have never seen
speeds like these.

31:04.408 --> 31:05.942
You're not gonna catch me!

31:05.943 --> 31:07.877
I got a secret weapon
right here on the dash.

31:07.878 --> 31:09.245
Ha haa!

31:09.246 --> 31:11.547
And the chute is
let loose right on the mark.

31:11.548 --> 31:13.816
There it goes!
It's deployed!

31:13.817 --> 31:15.018
Parachute's out!

31:15.019 --> 31:16.719
Oh, and it's away!

31:16.720 --> 31:20.924
Nice try,
but no cigar.

31:20.925 --> 31:23.059
I hope
that wasn't all he had.

31:23.060 --> 31:25.561
<i>Well, it wa all he had.</i>

31:25.562 --> 31:28.564
The parachute worked,
but not well enough.

31:31.035 --> 31:32.268
Aah! They caught me!

31:33.370 --> 31:36.839
Adam's been totally tailed
to his secret lair.

31:38.242 --> 31:39.609
Well, shoot!

31:39.610 --> 31:41.544
Well, your device
deployed fine.

31:41.545 --> 31:42.845
It deployed
beautifully.

31:42.846 --> 31:45.415
I was hoping it would either
make you stay too far back

31:45.416 --> 31:46.950
Or you'd get entangled
in it.

31:46.951 --> 31:49.652
If it had caught us just right,
it might have worked,

31:49.653 --> 31:50.853
But it didn't.

31:50.854 --> 31:52.088
Grrr!

31:52.089 --> 31:55.458
Adam admits
that it could have gone better.

31:55.459 --> 31:57.593
It might work
under certain circumstances,

31:57.594 --> 31:59.595
But to be a viable
spy-car-evasion technique,

31:59.596 --> 32:01.164
It really has to work
every time.

32:01.165 --> 32:03.933
So I think we've got to...

32:03.934 --> 32:07.537
Relegate the parachute
to the dustbin of failed ideas.

32:07.538 --> 32:11.007
Now it's all up to jamie
to press his advantage

32:11.008 --> 32:13.843
And take out
this head-to-head challenge.

32:13.844 --> 32:15.311
And if his plan comes off,

32:15.312 --> 32:17.847
Adam's in for
the ride of his life.

32:17.848 --> 32:20.550
Straight ahead --
a surprise result

32:20.551 --> 32:23.353
In a high-tech,
three-way machine shoot-out.

32:23.354 --> 32:24.354
Fire away!

32:31.282 --> 32:35.152
Can an object shot backwards
while traveling forwards

32:35.153 --> 32:37.254
Ever drop
straight to the ground?

32:37.255 --> 32:40.257
It's a fascinating thought,
but trying to prove it

32:40.258 --> 32:44.227
Is bringing our physics team
unraveled.

32:44.228 --> 32:46.196
Okay, either
this myth is busted

32:46.197 --> 32:47.965
Or our methodology's
flawed.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.466
I'm pretty sure
it's the latter.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.268
Okay, well, there's more than
one way to fling a ball.

32:51.269 --> 32:52.803
Let's look into some other
propulsion systems

32:52.804 --> 32:54.871
And figure out which one's
the most reliable.

32:54.872 --> 32:56.673
All right, we could get
a ball-pitching machine.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.108
They actually make them
for soccer balls.

32:58.109 --> 33:00.077
And as far as I know,
they're pretty accurate.

33:00.078 --> 33:01.645
I've got an idea
for another machine

33:01.646 --> 33:04.448
Where it actually punches the
ball without imparting any spin.

33:04.449 --> 33:05.649
That may help.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.318
Okay. Let's get started
and have a showdown.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.687
It sounds like a plan --

33:10.688 --> 33:13.523
Three machines,
including the air cannon,

33:13.524 --> 33:17.094
Competing to see which is
the most consistent shooter.

33:17.095 --> 33:19.630
The soccer-ball launcher
is designed

33:19.631 --> 33:23.467
To reliably fire ball after ball
at the same speed,

33:23.468 --> 33:25.235
And it's working just fine.

33:25.236 --> 33:26.937
Ohh!

33:26.938 --> 33:29.006
I think
you got your aim.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.541
And there's work to be done
on the factory floor.

33:31.542 --> 33:32.743
For machine number 2,

33:32.744 --> 33:37.180
Grant needs to modify
a "mythbusters" favorite.

33:37.181 --> 33:40.450
The last time you saw it, it had
a plate affixed to the end

33:40.451 --> 33:42.452
And it was
smashing frozen heads.

33:42.453 --> 33:44.921
<i>And I must say
it was a smashing success.</i>

33:48.593 --> 33:52.629
But now it's going to become
a soccer-ball-kicking robot.

33:52.630 --> 33:53.830
Just you wait.

33:53.831 --> 33:56.133
10 out of 10
for lateral thinking.

33:56.134 --> 33:59.703
And you know that when grant
gets his hands on a robot...

33:59.704 --> 34:01.772
It will "kick balls."

34:01.773 --> 34:03.740
okay.

34:03.741 --> 34:06.309
Okay, all of our kicking
contraptions should be complete,

34:06.310 --> 34:08.011
Which is perfect,
because it's time

34:08.012 --> 34:10.847
For the "mythbusters" world cup,
also known as calibration tests.

34:10.848 --> 34:12.616
We have our official goal
right here.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.284
Back here,
we have the contenders.

34:14.284 --> 34:16.119
First off,
we have the ball chucker.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.288
You're already familiar
with the air cannon.

34:18.289 --> 34:20.257
And, finally,
we have our robot-kicker.

34:20.257 --> 34:23.226
Consistency was a huge problem
when we did our last test,

34:23.226 --> 34:25.228
So that's
what we're testing now --

34:25.228 --> 34:28.297
Which one of these contraptions
will be the most consistent

34:28.299 --> 34:29.900
At 60 miles an hour.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.002
In 3...2...1.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.103
Wow.

34:34.105 --> 34:36.840
That was a good kick.
How fast did it go?

34:36.841 --> 34:38.507
58 miles an hour.

34:38.509 --> 34:39.509
Nice!
Boom!

34:39.510 --> 34:41.143
We're in
the ballpark.

34:41.145 --> 34:42.612
Kicking robot was great.

34:42.612 --> 34:45.215
It was consistent
within 3 miles per hour.

34:45.216 --> 34:48.018
Now moving on
to the ball chucker,

34:48.018 --> 34:50.587
Which -- well, it was actually
made to chuck balls,

34:50.588 --> 34:52.621
So, hopefully,
this will be consistent.

34:52.623 --> 34:54.257
All right.
We're ready to go.

34:54.257 --> 34:57.961
Tory's already fine-tuned
the speed of the tires,

34:57.962 --> 34:59.563
And from the very first ball,

34:59.564 --> 35:01.698
It looks like
he's right in the zone.

35:01.699 --> 35:02.899
God! 59.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.836
It's an impressive display
from the favorite,

35:05.837 --> 35:07.504
But there's still one to go.

35:07.505 --> 35:09.239
All right,
why don't we do this --

35:09.240 --> 35:11.007
Let's test the air cannon
one more time.

35:11.008 --> 35:12.309
I mean, who knows?

35:12.310 --> 35:14.745
Maybe it's more consistent
than the other machine.

35:14.746 --> 35:17.114
All right.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.049
Going up to 9 p.S.I.

35:19.050 --> 35:22.652
So, it come down
to these last five shots.

35:22.653 --> 35:23.920
Fire away!

35:29.260 --> 35:31.495
The shootout is finished,

35:31.496 --> 35:33.497
And the result
is a shock to everyone.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.866
You know what --
out of all the machines,

35:35.867 --> 35:38.135
This one looks like
it's the most consistent.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.437
Yeah, I think we all know
who the winner was,

35:40.438 --> 35:43.106
But just for fun, I calculated
the standard deviation.

35:43.107 --> 35:45.375
<i>You and I have
really different ideas on fun.</i>

35:46.377 --> 35:47.711
He said "fun."

35:47.712 --> 35:49.546
go ahead.

35:49.547 --> 35:52.382
Okay,
this one's 1.22.

35:52.383 --> 35:55.919
This one is 2.3.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.922
And the winner
and still champion --

35:58.923 --> 36:01.825
Air cannon with 0.84.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.160
Oh, my gosh.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.328
After all that, we have to
go back to the air cannon.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.863
Yes.

36:06.864 --> 36:10.066
The ball speed's
as close as we're going to get,

36:10.067 --> 36:13.103
But let's not forget
that's just half the equation.

36:13.104 --> 36:16.306
If the speed going forward
is also in doubt,

36:16.307 --> 36:18.441
We'd be fools not to fix it.

36:18.442 --> 36:20.811
And kari's no fool.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.814
So, the solution to
our speedometer problem is this.

36:23.815 --> 36:24.981
It's a tachometer.

36:24.982 --> 36:26.516
Now what we're going to do

36:26.517 --> 36:28.985
Is we're gonna brace it
with all sorts of clamps

36:28.986 --> 36:31.621
That I've scavenged
from the camera department.

36:31.622 --> 36:33.657
So it's right here
against the wheel.

36:33.658 --> 36:35.192
We have some reflective tape.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.660
It's going to make the laser

36:36.661 --> 36:38.528
Able to pick up
every revolution,

36:38.529 --> 36:40.497
And from there,
we can do the math,

36:40.498 --> 36:42.766
Find out exactly
how fast our car is going.

36:42.767 --> 36:46.136
Now they've done all the.Can do
to fine-tune the hardware.

36:46.137 --> 36:49.639
But will cannon reloaded
reverse the results?

36:49.640 --> 36:52.242
Only time
mixed with patience...

36:52.243 --> 36:53.243
Nards!

36:53.244 --> 36:54.277
...Will tell.

36:54.278 --> 36:56.413
And still to come...

36:56.414 --> 36:59.616
Jamie unleashes
his arsenal of car killers.

36:59.617 --> 37:02.252
We hear this "boom!"
and he takes off.

37:09.989 --> 37:11.422
Tory, kari, and grant

37:11.423 --> 37:15.460
Are struggling to prove
the supposedly common-sense myth

37:15.461 --> 37:18.196
That an object
drops straight to the ground

37:18.197 --> 37:21.800
When its forward and backward
momentum are exactly the same.

37:21.801 --> 37:23.368
So here's where we're at.

37:23.369 --> 37:24.836
Fire away!

37:24.837 --> 37:28.807
Grant's air cannon was precise
enough to earn a second shot.

37:28.808 --> 37:32.143
But kari's replaced
a possibly faulty speedometer

37:32.144 --> 37:34.913
With an incredibly accurate
tachometer.

37:34.914 --> 37:37.115
This is it.
We have eliminated
all the variables.

37:37.116 --> 37:39.350
We have the cannon
shooting at 60 miles an hour,

37:39.351 --> 37:41.719
The car driving
at 60 miles an hour --

37:41.720 --> 37:44.956
Just to show that this ball
will drop straight down.

37:44.957 --> 37:46.858
This is it.
It's "go" time.

37:46.859 --> 37:47.859
Go!

37:49.295 --> 37:52.330
Look, this is a classic
physics thought experiment.

37:52.331 --> 37:54.365
I mean,
you've got something moving.

37:54.366 --> 37:57.402
You fire something
off of that moving vehicle

37:57.403 --> 37:58.570
At the same speed,

37:58.571 --> 38:01.806
And, ideally,
it should cancel out.

38:01.807 --> 38:03.441
But this is the real world.

38:03.442 --> 38:04.442
Ah.

38:04.443 --> 38:06.477
And the real world remains

38:06.478 --> 38:10.281
A frustratingly difficult place
to do science.

38:10.282 --> 38:12.150
The cannon was fired
a little too soon.

38:12.151 --> 38:13.384
This is all
a bit finicky.

38:13.385 --> 38:15.153
I think we're gonna
have to try it a lot

38:15.154 --> 38:16.487
Until we get it perfect.

38:16.488 --> 38:20.425
More tests only lead
to more disappointment.

38:20.426 --> 38:24.362
<i>Once again, grant's timing
is just off the mark.</i>

38:24.363 --> 38:28.833
But kari at least sees a light
at the end of the runway.

38:28.834 --> 38:31.135
I have a feeling
that we ar.Ver close

38:31.136 --> 38:32.670
To a perfect demonstration.

38:32.671 --> 38:34.405
We're gonna see that ball drop.

38:34.406 --> 38:36.808
With the forward
and backward momentum

38:36.809 --> 38:39.344
Matched as close
as they're going to get it,

38:39.345 --> 38:41.379
The pressure's on grant
for a perfect release.

38:43.816 --> 38:47.418
<i>I don't know about you guys, but
that looked pretty good to me.</i>

38:47.419 --> 38:49.687
Let's check the high-speed.

38:49.688 --> 38:52.423
It really looked good
to the naked eye.

38:52.424 --> 38:54.959
But the judge in this case
is the high-speed.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.996
Oh, my god!
It's like a cartoon!

38:57.997 --> 39:00.431
It's just in the air.
It stops and it just falls.

39:00.432 --> 39:02.100
- Look at that.
- It's fantastic.

39:02.101 --> 39:04.002
I mean, look --
it doesn't move at all.

39:04.003 --> 39:05.169
It's going straight down.

39:05.170 --> 39:06.905
Whoo!
Amazing!

39:06.906 --> 39:09.140
We did it!
We did it!

39:09.141 --> 39:10.275
Yeah!
Yeah!                   Yeah!

39:10.276 --> 39:11.743
Vector edition!
Yay!
Whoo!

39:11.744 --> 39:12.744
Yeah!

39:12.745 --> 39:14.512
We canceled out
velocity!

39:14.513 --> 39:17.315
After three days of suffering,

39:17.316 --> 39:20.885
That single shot
brings the myth to an end.

39:20.886 --> 39:21.953
I can't be happier.

39:21.954 --> 39:23.922
We actually got
the speed of the car

39:23.923 --> 39:25.957
To match the speed
of the soccer ball,

39:25.958 --> 39:29.160
And we got
a perfect straight-down drop.

39:29.161 --> 39:30.828
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:30.829 --> 39:34.132
The laws of physics
are still hard at work.

39:41.073 --> 39:44.342
Adam's attempt
to escape jamie's spy car

39:44.343 --> 39:46.711
Came sadly adrift.

39:46.712 --> 39:49.714
Parachute's out!
Oh, and it's away!

39:49.715 --> 39:53.084
Things might have gone better
with a backup device,

39:53.085 --> 39:56.421
And jamie will not make
the same mistake.

39:56.422 --> 39:58.823
First up
are my tailgater terminators,

39:58.824 --> 40:03.061
Which are gonna deploy out
of the back of my car like so.

40:03.062 --> 40:05.930
Notice that I've placed them
in a narrow area

40:05.931 --> 40:08.299
That the chase car
pretty muc.Has to go through,

40:08.300 --> 40:10.969
And that means that they have to
drive over these things.

40:10.970 --> 40:13.838
Frankly, if they do,
I think they're done.

40:13.839 --> 40:15.273
But...

40:17.977 --> 40:19.677
...If they're still moving,

40:19.678 --> 40:22.447
I go to plan "b,"
which is the side shooter.

40:22.448 --> 40:24.782
Now, this ppy
will be shooting out

40:24.783 --> 40:28.653
From underneat.M car
to underneat.Their car,

40:28.654 --> 40:29.954
Where it opens up

40:29.955 --> 40:32.890
And also will prohibit them
from moving forward --

40:32.891 --> 40:35.760
Not to mention the fact
that I have a smoke bomb

40:35.761 --> 40:38.296
That is gonna be set off
at the same time

40:38.297 --> 40:40.531
Just for -- well, fun.

40:40.532 --> 40:41.833
Probably just as well

40:41.834 --> 40:44.168
Adam doesn't know
what's about to hit him.

40:44.169 --> 40:46.270
Hey, guys?
Yeah?

40:46.271 --> 40:48.773
See if you can keep up,
okay?

40:48.774 --> 40:51.576
Ha! Roger that,
secret agent code name walrus.

40:51.577 --> 40:53.411
go!

40:58.484 --> 41:00.785
Just a few seconds in,

41:00.786 --> 41:04.155
Jamie launches the first
of his deadly barrages.

41:04.156 --> 41:05.590
He's playing the game.

41:05.591 --> 41:07.759
I said "puppies."
he's throwing puppies out.

41:07.760 --> 41:11.562
Brian heedlessly plows through
the pelting of puppies

41:11.563 --> 41:13.231
And regains lost ground.

41:13.232 --> 41:17.301
But to pull off
his serious double deployment,

41:17.302 --> 41:20.505
<i>Jamie needs
to slow way, wa down.</i>

41:22.474 --> 41:25.610
Brian has no choice
but to take on the spikes...

41:27.713 --> 41:30.882
...Only to find he's been set up
for the sucker punch.

41:30.883 --> 41:34.118
And then
jamie's just looking at us.

41:34.119 --> 41:35.686
We hear this "boom!"

41:35.687 --> 41:37.088
Whoa!
And he takes off.

41:37.089 --> 41:39.657
Bye!

41:39.658 --> 41:44.195
And, incredibly, adam and brian
lurch off right behind him,

41:44.196 --> 41:47.198
Hauling enough shrapnel
to sink a battleship.

41:47.199 --> 41:48.766
We are on you!

41:50.202 --> 41:54.072
The car's leaking gas,
and the noise is not healthy.

41:56.008 --> 41:58.109
But they ride jamie's tail

41:58.110 --> 42:01.345
For a five-minute lap
of the desolate streets...

42:05.851 --> 42:08.152
...Till their prey
makes a bolt for his burrow.

42:13.892 --> 42:16.060
We found him!

42:18.630 --> 42:20.998
You guys
are leaking a little bit.

42:20.999 --> 42:23.835
I don't know. What do you think?
Did I get away or didn't I?

42:23.836 --> 42:25.536
Technically,
yo.Didn' get away,

42:25.537 --> 42:28.506
'cause we saw you turn in here
from the road, so we caught you.

42:28.507 --> 42:30.708
If you had went any farther,
we wouldn't have.

42:30.709 --> 42:32.577
This thing wasn't running
much longer.

42:32.578 --> 42:35.746
One of the spikes
is still stuck in the car,

42:35.747 --> 42:39.183
And jamie can't fathom
how this one turned pear-shaped.

42:39.184 --> 42:41.519
I can't believe
they were able to keep going.

42:41.520 --> 42:44.589
I mean, I thought those spikes
were a deathtrap for that car.

42:44.590 --> 42:45.990
So, how are we gonna
wrap this up?

42:45.991 --> 42:48.259
Well, between the five things
that we tested,

42:48.260 --> 42:49.927
I think
we've definitely proved

42:49.928 --> 42:51.896
That stopping a car
that's chasing you

42:51.897 --> 42:54.298
Instantly in its tracks
is actually really hard.

42:54.299 --> 42:56.067
Well, your parachute
might have worked

42:56.068 --> 42:57.468
Under
perfect circumstances,

42:57.469 --> 43:00.004
But as it was,
it was pretty much a bust.

43:00.005 --> 43:01.372
And your spikes,

43:01.373 --> 43:04.575
While ultimately, I think,
effective in the long haul,

43:04.576 --> 43:06.377
Were far
from instantaneous.

43:06.378 --> 43:09.113
Something tells me
you guys are already
cooking up other ideas.

43:09.114 --> 43:10.114
yeah.

43:10.115 --> 43:11.582
I smell a revisit.

43:11.583 --> 43:12.984
so do I.
