00:53.000 --> 00:55.036
They're fighting again!

01:00.800 --> 01:02.028
Oh, boy.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.720
Don't! Wait! Not my homework!

01:05.920 --> 01:07.239
No! Stop it! No!

01:07.640 --> 01:08.868
Problem, gentlemen?

01:09.280 --> 01:10.395
Hey, dork-brain!

01:10.640 --> 01:13.677
If you weren't a girl,
I'd beat your face off.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.348
If you weren't a girl,
I'd beat your face off.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.794
You're calling me a girl?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.274
You called me one!

01:19.920 --> 01:20.989
You asked for it.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.798
Now get out of here!

01:33.120 --> 01:34.519
Forget those guys.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.871
They're jealous because you're
smart and funny.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.991
And girls like that.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.792
What girls?

01:42.240 --> 01:43.753
Lots of girls.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.839
I mean... I like you.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.749
I don't like you. Now everybody
thinks I need a girl to fight for me.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.030
You are a dork-brain.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.474
My nose!

02:01.760 --> 02:02.749
Wimp!

02:22.360 --> 02:24.112
Moe and Larry in the house.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.518
Grant, what have we got out back?

02:29.240 --> 02:30.559
All clear, sir.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.353
Matthews, what do you got?

02:33.480 --> 02:35.471
Returnable cans, sir.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.552
I'm up to 75 cents.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.399
Hey, we got a cab.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.753
Here comes Curly.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.679
The Three Stooges.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.070
Check it out, lvan's packing.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.315
Thank you! We've got a briefcase.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.556
Hart, waiting for visual confirmation.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.273
No disc yet.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.478
Suitcase is opening.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.312
This woman's ass is in the way.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.869
Hart, we can't see a damn thing.
We need to see the discs.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.228
- This broaďs got two asses!
- Do something!

03:56.680 --> 03:57.954
Excuse me.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.959
You wanting something else?

04:00.160 --> 04:03.596
Yeah. You know what?
I really love this borscht.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.231
Or, as they say in Russian:

04:11.240 --> 04:12.912
We got the discs.

04:13.160 --> 04:13.956
We're moving in!

04:29.480 --> 04:31.152
Get down!

04:33.400 --> 04:35.675
Keep your hands where I can see them!

04:38.880 --> 04:39.790
No English.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.110
Nobody moves until I see
some goddamn "Lazhitsa na pol"!

05:01.280 --> 05:02.838
Sir, he's turning purple!

05:03.200 --> 05:05.555
Hart, until we secure, you stay.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.553
That is one really, really
purple Russian, sir!

05:17.760 --> 05:20.115
He's still armed! Nobody moves!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.276
Hands up! Back off!

05:25.320 --> 05:26.753
No, sir. He's not gonna die.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.038
He's not good enough for that.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.198
His victims didn't get a chance
to choke on a peanut, did they, sir?

05:35.920 --> 05:37.239
Now you're going down.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.633
Drop the guns or I'll kill her.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.595
Ivan, out the back.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.552
You're not killing anyone.

06:15.760 --> 06:16.795
Party's over!

06:22.520 --> 06:24.636
How's your head, my little piroshki?

06:25.400 --> 06:27.914
This is gonna put you away
for a long time.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.151
Les get that ambulance in here!

06:32.840 --> 06:35.308
- Shut up!
- Stay with me!

06:35.520 --> 06:38.478
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. You did a great job!

06:52.920 --> 06:55.593
Nice work. See you back there.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.919
Come on, Hart. The van's waiting.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.158
I got Grant shot.
I shouldn't have moved.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.191
Come on, you made a choice.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.073
It was wrong, but thas it.
Is over.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.079
By the way, you look like hell.

09:12.200 --> 09:15.351
- Morning, Mrs. Schwartz. Schnatzie.
- Good morning, Gracie.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.149
Hart.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.549
Yes, sir.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.955
ETA, 20 minutes.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.589
No problem. Breakdown?

09:24.760 --> 09:28.150
Yes, sir. Negative.
Do not need assistance.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.910
Ten-four. Yes, sir, I know is hot.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.511
Hey, you cannot park...

10:00.600 --> 10:02.716
Is an emergency. Official business.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.229
Aside, please. Thank you.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.869
Official business. Step aside.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.071
Hey, get lost! I'm waiting here.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.271
FBI. You might want
to stay out of this.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.517
Excuse me.
Sir, ma'am, please back off.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.677
All right. I need eight double-tall...

10:22.560 --> 10:24.835
Eight double-tall lattes.
One with no foam.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.600
Five decaf lattes with a long straw.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.631
Four caramel macchiattos.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.671
Double up on the cup.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.872
Two blueberry scones
with the little granules on top...

10:35.080 --> 10:36.877
...and one Starbucks compilation CD.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.151
No! I would like...

10:47.640 --> 10:49.995
Whas going on? Where's McDonald?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.555
Could we put out an APB
on my Frappuccino?

10:52.760 --> 10:55.957
Is in the bag. Did he say anything
about last night?

10:56.160 --> 10:59.550
Relax. Don't annoy him.
Don't say anything. Don't argue.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.354
I don't argue. I never argue.
When do I argue?

11:02.600 --> 11:05.433
I might have a heated discussion
with somebody.

11:05.640 --> 11:08.438
Is this you not arguing?
Because you suck at it.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.073
Morning, everybody.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.311
Morning, sir. Is...

11:13.280 --> 11:14.190
Sir.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.879
Okay, everybody.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.710
I know you're all concerned
about Grans condition.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.990
So I'm happy to report...

11:22.560 --> 11:25.950
...Jerry's gonna be fine. He'll be
out of the hospital in two weeks.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.593
He says he's expecting lots of gifts.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.832
Okay, everybody.

11:31.520 --> 11:35.195
So much for the good news. We got
another letter from the Citizen.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.756
Arson, explosives, poison...

11:37.960 --> 11:40.554
...this guy never works
the same way twice.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.150
The only thing we know for sure...

11:44.640 --> 11:47.518
...is, we get these letters full
of incomprehensible riddles...

11:47.720 --> 11:50.075
...he strikes and suddenly
the clues make sense.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.831
This one is down in Intelligence.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.952
Hopefully, we'll get a lead
before somebody gets killed.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.275
In the meantime...

11:57.520 --> 12:00.239
...Matthews, get a team together.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.199
Sir, you want me to take point?

12:03.400 --> 12:05.391
For five years you've wanted it.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.837
Last night, you earned it.
Pick your team.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.600
I want preliminaries by 3.
Thas it.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.710
Sir?

12:17.160 --> 12:18.513
Who's buying me lunch?

12:18.720 --> 12:21.871
Sir, I would like to talk
about what happened last night.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.672
I didn't exactly follow orders...

12:23.880 --> 12:26.189
"Exactly" follow orders?
There's no such thing.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.277
You follow orders or you don't.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.357
No arguments, sir. None whatsoever.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.477
Until the hearing,
you're out of the field.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.796
The hearing is totally warranted.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.514
Wouldn't I be better
on the Citizen case?

12:37.720 --> 12:39.995
I have a background
in profiling and decoding.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.394
I could contribute.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.153
Like you contributed last night?

12:43.360 --> 12:45.316
By putting yourself
and 5 agents in jeopardy?

12:45.520 --> 12:47.590
I'll save the rest
for the review board.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.872
You will bury yourself
under a mountain of paperwork.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.911
Discussion is over.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.270
Mike, give me a pint.

13:12.680 --> 13:13.795
Rough day?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.553
The worst.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.034
Sure you want a whole one?

13:17.640 --> 13:20.234
Yeah. Hit me bigtime, baby.

13:20.480 --> 13:24.871
Hey, Einstein. If you figure out
that Citizen letter, let me know.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.678
Congratulations on the op.
Is a big shot.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.395
Thanks.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.558
How are you doing? You okay?

13:33.800 --> 13:35.199
I'm good.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.593
You're starting early today.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.519
Yeah, I'm gonna get chip-faced.
Want to join me?

13:41.800 --> 13:44.712
I'd love to, but I have
a pressing social engagement.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.355
Beth!

13:46.920 --> 13:48.194
Brownie meeting.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.152
Mike, give me a beer and...

13:51.120 --> 13:52.553
Milk. Give her milk.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.592
White wine spritzer.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.149
Are most of the people in here agents?

13:57.360 --> 14:00.318
As a matter of fact, here's
an agent. Gracie Hart.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.993
Beth Carter.

14:03.720 --> 14:04.948
Right back to you.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.630
Beth is an undergrad at Vassar,
doing a paper on law enforcement.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.592
I'm helping her get an inside look.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.876
I bet she'll do the same for you.

14:13.160 --> 14:16.232
Gracie, I would love to get
a woman's point of view.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.637
You're barking up the wrong tree.
Right, Hart?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.231
Do all the women have to wear
those really masculine shoes?

14:27.520 --> 14:30.910
I get these made special by the guy
that put the tattoo on my ass.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.793
We'll leave you with Ben and Jerry.
Catch you later.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.560
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.716
Hope you have a good time at the mall.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.559
Wohop is the place.

14:42.760 --> 14:45.957
Wohop is good, but if you like
variety, you go to La Chinita Linda.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.559
Their rice and beans are slamming.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.354
I don't want variety.
I get pork fried rice every...

14:50.560 --> 14:53.632
I figured it out! I tried to create
a content-based pattern...

14:53.840 --> 14:55.068
...similar to his previous letters.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.032
But this time, he used a signifier.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.470
In this case, the word "miss"...

14:59.680 --> 15:03.116
...in the subsequent letters.
Will you let me finish?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.231
Is the Miss United States Pageant.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.153
Yeah. Intelligence thought so too.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.719
What do we got?

15:10.200 --> 15:13.237
Miss United States from San Antonio,
Texas, home of the Alamo.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.708
I forgot the Alamo.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.957
The pageant lasts three days.
Preliminaries, conferences...

15:18.160 --> 15:20.913
...the live telecast.
Is a logistical nightmare.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.348
Not just a babe-fest.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.793
Jesus, we've only got 48 hours.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.031
Okay, gentlemen.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.193
Where do we start?

15:35.800 --> 15:39.554
You might want to call the network and
pageant people. Set up a meeting.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.672
Because you'll probably need
their cooperation.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.630
Yeah, I can do that. Les do that.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.398
What about jurisdiction?

15:50.720 --> 15:52.995
The Citizen has been ours
from the start.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.475
You might want to call San Antonio.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.830
Grease some wheels so they like us...

15:58.040 --> 15:59.553
...when we need manpower and tech.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.079
While I'm at it, les do that.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.196
Good idea.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.198
He loves to make a splash.
His target will be public...

16:05.400 --> 16:08.073
...like one of these outdoor prelims
or a TV broadcast.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.032
Telecasters at the convention center.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.835
We're gonna need surveillance
on the interior perimeter.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.508
We'll need more.
There's a million places...

16:16.720 --> 16:20.190
...only these bikini-stuffers can go:
Backstage areas, hotel rooms...

16:20.400 --> 16:22.197
We need to get somebody in there.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.516
Yeah! Now I'm thinking...

16:25.320 --> 16:26.355
...undercover.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.953
Good idea, boss.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.479
I got just the girl.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.072
Thas nothing. Check this out.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.511
Compliments of my daughter:
The "Dress Up Sally" web site.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.598
What did I tell you? Hot, right?

16:50.800 --> 16:51.710
Yeah, baby.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.112
You got a little problem.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.594
She's perfect!

16:55.800 --> 16:56.915
Look to the left.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.273
Down... down...

17:01.240 --> 17:03.196
- There you go.
- "On maternity leave"?

17:03.400 --> 17:04.594
Thas not gonna work.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.394
Not unless is
"The Miss Lamaze Pageant."

17:12.800 --> 17:14.790
Can you do a search?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.719
Female field agents under 35.

17:29.520 --> 17:30.589
Jensen, Jensen!

17:41.800 --> 17:45.031
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I got it, I got it!

17:55.560 --> 17:56.515
Oh, no!

17:56.720 --> 17:57.948
Thas right, thas right!

18:01.600 --> 18:03.795
You think thas good?
Check this out.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.519
I got the winner right here.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.630
Scorekeepers ready?

18:12.360 --> 18:14.191
This is the best part.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.799
He's right behind me, isn't he?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.831
Not really my color, is it?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.149
Sir, we were just...

18:32.720 --> 18:35.314
...looking for someone
to go undercover at the pageant.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.118
And I'm the best we have.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.151
It doesn't inspire much confidence.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.239
Get back to work.

18:42.680 --> 18:46.195
- Hart, shouldn't you be at a desk?
- Yes, sir.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.120
You don't say anything?
Made me look like an idiot.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.834
Do I have eyes in the back of my head?

18:53.080 --> 18:55.469
- He was standing right behind me.
- What were we gonna say?

18:55.680 --> 18:56.715
- What?
- This one.

18:57.760 --> 18:58.988
Are you kidding? Is Hart.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.475
Cut it off. Les go back to work.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.549
Very funny.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.239
Hold on. Thas not bad.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.837
Hold on, nothing. Hit the save button
because you won't see that again.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.596
- What do you say?
- No freaking way.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.835
Why not?

19:22.040 --> 19:24.759
I won't parade around in a swimsuit
like some bimbo...

19:24.960 --> 19:28.669
...named Gracie Lou Freebush,
and all she wants is world peace.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.234
It wouldn't be like that.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.596
You'd be on the undercover team.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.552
Right. In a thong.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.038
In a tasteful one-piece!

19:39.240 --> 19:41.629
You do a few butt-shaping exercises...

19:41.880 --> 19:43.199
...you could pull this off.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.879
You know what? Pull this off.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.672
Is it because McDonald hates me?

19:46.880 --> 19:48.950
Or is it, like, a woman thing?

19:51.720 --> 19:54.553
Don't kid yourself.
Nobody thinks of you that way.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.678
He's punishing me, isn't he?

20:00.880 --> 20:03.155
I had to beg him to let you do this.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.920
Thas right. Like it or not,
you screwed up, pal.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.394
Sit down, sit down.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.954
I've never been in a beauty pageant.

20:17.160 --> 20:20.152
I don't even own a dress.
I don't even own a brush.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.879
Which part of that
is supposed to shock me?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.158
Les suspend reality for a second...

20:36.360 --> 20:37.713
...and pretend I said yes.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.911
I got to do everything? Like...

20:40.120 --> 20:42.634
...the whole big hair
and the makeup and...

20:42.840 --> 20:43.795
Damn right.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.073
The spinning, the twirling, the
smiling, the cute little tap number.

20:49.560 --> 20:50.675
Hundred bucks on Matthews.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.111
I don't know. She's got rage.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.999
I'll take that bet.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.758
Yeah, baby.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.634
So you're saying...

21:12.840 --> 21:15.070
...I have to wear the bathing suit?

21:15.320 --> 21:18.437
Yeah, you have
to wear the bathing suit.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.275
Okay.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.273
You go, girl.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.796
Where am I gonna put my gun?

21:29.160 --> 21:31.390
No place I want to know about.

21:33.040 --> 21:36.715
What could possibly motivate anybody
to enter a beauty pageant?

21:36.920 --> 21:39.115
Scholarship money,
a chance to see the world...

21:39.320 --> 21:41.117
...broaden your horizons...

21:41.320 --> 21:44.517
So join the Marines. Is like
feminism never even happened.

21:44.720 --> 21:48.599
Any woman that does this is catering
to misogynistic Neanderthal mentality.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.791
I dated Young Miss Scarsdale.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.877
Can you really be this superficial?

21:53.080 --> 21:54.672
Hard to believe, right?

21:54.880 --> 21:55.869
Here we are.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.988
Therefore, we'd like to use
one of our team undercover.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.838
Am I hearing this correctly?

22:01.040 --> 22:05.238
Kathy, these people want
to put one of their agents...

22:05.640 --> 22:06.868
...in the pageant.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.149
They want her to win?

22:08.360 --> 22:09.918
No, ma'am.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.876
We will need your help
with the judging...

22:13.080 --> 22:15.310
...so our agent is in the top five...

22:15.560 --> 22:18.358
...to have access to
all the areas at all times.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.750
- Absolutely not.
- Miss Morningside...

22:21.080 --> 22:23.071
...we understand how important
this beauty pageant...

22:23.280 --> 22:24.633
Excuse me.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.916
This is not a beauty pageant.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.076
This is a scholarship program.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.919
And it has been ever since my reign.

22:32.120 --> 22:35.032
I fully intend on maintaining
that credo.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.559
Absolutely, Miss Morningside.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.268
We're here to protect the girls.
Women.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.669
Scholarship ladies.

22:42.120 --> 22:45.954
There's nothing more important to me
than the safety of my girls.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.958
I'd rather cancel the pageant
than have them blown up.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.958
Especially without their knowledge.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.717
We went to the network to cancel,
but they refused.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.035
We can't force them.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.635
I'm confused.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.592
What state is she going to be from?

23:00.800 --> 23:02.677
All the winners have been chosen.

23:03.360 --> 23:07.353
We recently discovered some
information about Miss New Jersey.

23:07.560 --> 23:11.030
And her performance in a little
film called Arma Get It On.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.079
Was that her?

23:13.400 --> 23:14.628
Oh, yeah!

23:15.280 --> 23:18.352
She was gonna drop out pretty soon,
if you know what I mean.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.755
Do you have an agent in mind?

23:29.400 --> 23:30.355
Sorry.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.839
Let me get you
Victor Melling's number.

23:35.040 --> 23:35.916
Frank.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.633
He's our pageant consultant.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.275
Frank.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.518
Maybe he can do something to help.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.709
Frank!

23:47.080 --> 23:48.832
This is my assistant, Frank Tobin.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.792
Hi, everyone.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.673
Would you get these people
Victor's number, please?

23:53.880 --> 23:55.199
And get me a spring water.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.913
And tuck in your shirt.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.068
That, that was... a water for you...

24:01.280 --> 24:02.554
...and...

24:02.760 --> 24:05.115
Victor Melling's number.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.834
Mr. Melling.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.075
How are you?

24:26.640 --> 24:29.996
If you are Grace Hart,
I quit here and now.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.118
I'm having a bad hair day.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.677
Bad hair decade, really.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.512
I'm Eric Matthews. We spoke.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.279
Your hair is perfect.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.277
However, I can't accept this job.

24:42.520 --> 24:45.239
There's no way I can make
this woman ready in two days.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.831
Please, Mr. Melling,
give it a chance. Sit down.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.190
Have lunch. Totally on the Bureau.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.797
I suppose that would be
the civilized thing to do.

24:56.280 --> 24:59.955
I'll take a rain check.
I got to take care of some FBI stuff.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.833
That thing I told you
about that I gotta do.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.873
But I'll see you later.
We'll hang out. You like caps?

25:06.600 --> 25:08.636
I'll get you an official FBI cap.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.389
See you later.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.515
What a pity.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.471
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.591
- Yes.
- Yeah.

25:17.920 --> 25:21.117
It is always "yes,"
never "yeah." Sit down.

25:22.320 --> 25:26.154
Miss United States is always
well-spoken and polite.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.549
Do you understand?

25:27.760 --> 25:29.034
Watch the hands, garcon.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.798
- Excuse me.
- Is all right.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.352
I have a feeling we're going to need
a drop cloth later.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.995
Could I have another
cabernet sauvignon?

25:49.200 --> 25:50.679
Another keg for you?

25:51.080 --> 25:53.640
- I'm good, thanks.
- Thas okay, Philip.

25:53.880 --> 25:57.429
So, how long have you been doing
this pageant-training thing?

25:57.640 --> 25:58.550
I'm sorry?

25:59.080 --> 26:03.358
What was the question? I was
distracted by a half-masticated cow...

26:03.560 --> 26:06.393
...rolling around
in your wide-open trap.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.318
Excuse me? What is your problem?

26:08.520 --> 26:09.589
- Problem?
- Yeah.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.234
I mean, yes.
Have I offended you in some way?

26:12.440 --> 26:16.319
You've been completely antagonistic
to me from the second I walked in.

26:16.520 --> 26:19.114
I was once the most
sought-after, highly paid...

26:19.360 --> 26:21.351
...consultant in pageant history.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.516
I had no idea.

26:24.600 --> 26:28.275
Every season, girls would plead
with me to train them.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.630
Ten out of 11 years...

26:30.840 --> 26:32.796
...my girls were crowned.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.310
The year we lost,
the winner was a deaf-mute.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.158
You can't beat that.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.635
Then...

26:42.560 --> 26:44.152
...in '96...

26:44.520 --> 26:48.035
...my girl froze like a puddle halfway
through her aria from La Bohéme.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.711
Afterwards, she told
a reporter from Pageant Magazine...

26:51.920 --> 26:53.592
...that I was a perfectionist...

26:53.800 --> 26:57.315
...who had harangued her
to within an inch of her sanity.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.911
Of course,
after that article came out...

27:02.440 --> 27:04.112
...nobody wanted me.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.713
Okay. With all due respect here...

27:10.920 --> 27:13.275
...why did Miss Morningside
suggest you?

27:13.520 --> 27:16.114
Because I am the best.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.639
Or perhaps is because everyone else
worth having had a contestant.

27:24.240 --> 27:28.028
They had their Southern belles,
their Midwestern farmers' daughters.

27:28.240 --> 27:31.038
Spunky Western cowgirls.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.315
And I have...

27:34.320 --> 27:35.753
...Dirty Harriet.

27:39.640 --> 27:41.312
Will you desist?

27:41.720 --> 27:42.630
Yeah.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.353
Yes.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.759
Oh, my God.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.076
I haven't seen a walk like that
since Jurassic Park.

27:53.280 --> 27:57.159
Is been working really well for me
for the past 30 years, all right?

27:57.360 --> 27:59.237
Well, glide, now. Glide.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.199
Don't look down, don't look down.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.757
Don't look down, look up. Your chin
should be parallel to the floor.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.473
Now glide. Glide.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.509
Is not the bloody Ice Capades.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.153
Gliding.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.270
No, no. Don't pick your feet up.
Don't pick your feet up.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.913
Why are you picking your feet up?

28:19.160 --> 28:20.832
Because I'm preparing to run away.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.712
No, wait. Wait.

28:22.920 --> 28:23.796
Watch me.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.638
Glide. Glide.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.752
See? Glide.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.554
Is all in the buttocks.
Don't I look pretty?

28:34.000 --> 28:36.594
It takes a very secure man
to walk like that.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.759
Roll your hips.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.679
Head up, head up. Keep gliding...

28:45.560 --> 28:46.788
I'm gliding here!

28:47.000 --> 28:48.035
What are you, blind?

28:48.240 --> 28:49.559
Asshole.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.919
Look how she walks. She's floating.

29:26.120 --> 29:29.317
Lightly ascending
from cloud to cloud...

29:29.680 --> 29:31.193
...towards heaven.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.910
He takes one look at that fake rack...

29:35.120 --> 29:36.951
...he's gonna send her right back.

29:39.760 --> 29:43.435
Look, she's gonna cry again.
"If I only had a brain!"

29:44.400 --> 29:46.960
I am somewhat less than amused.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.078
How's she doing?

29:57.240 --> 29:59.356
With some intensive work...

29:59.680 --> 30:02.752
...she'll be ready for the worlďs
finest trailer park.

30:03.680 --> 30:04.874
Thank you!

30:09.000 --> 30:10.558
Both painful...

30:10.760 --> 30:12.193
...and grotesque.

30:12.640 --> 30:13.868
Isn't it?

30:18.160 --> 30:19.752
Oh, my God!

30:29.560 --> 30:32.711
Mr. Vic, we got everything
you asked for. Where do we start?

30:32.920 --> 30:34.956
Teeth, hair, manicure, pedicure.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.309
Which one first?

30:36.560 --> 30:38.755
What are you gonna do to my teeth?

30:38.960 --> 30:42.236
Hopefully, remove the beer stains
and steak residue.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.038
Can't I get some Novocain?

30:46.280 --> 30:47.679
Is only a cleaning.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.075
Sweeney Todd, what are you doing?

30:50.320 --> 30:52.072
Your hair should make a statement.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.033
As long as is not,
"Thanks for the Country Music Award."

30:55.240 --> 30:57.231
You'll be lucky
if I can get it untangled.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.395
No mercy.

30:58.640 --> 30:59.789
Can I borrow that drill?

31:02.280 --> 31:04.350
Attention. Attention.

31:04.600 --> 31:08.593
All hair removal units,
wax, electrolysis, laser...

31:08.800 --> 31:11.712
...to commence at 2300 hours.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.869
Bikini wax.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.393
How you doing?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.079
Ever seen one this big?

31:48.280 --> 31:49.759
Sandwich, I mean.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.878
Thas a lot of meat.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.599
Thank you!

31:57.840 --> 32:00.115
Nobody said this job was easy.

32:13.720 --> 32:17.349
This earpiece lets you hear anybody
on our frequencies.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.319
I don't need it. With all this foil,
I'm getting HBO.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.039
This is a pin camera.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.071
There's an actual lens in there.

32:25.280 --> 32:28.033
It provides a digital video
feed to our hookups.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.598
Here's your new I.D.s.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.836
Pageant identity.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.238
Gracie Lou Freebush?

32:35.560 --> 32:36.879
I remembered you liked that.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.231
Well, my IQ just dropped 10 points.

32:43.640 --> 32:46.029
More... fluffy.

32:46.560 --> 32:49.199
Eyebrows. There should be two.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.156
Another two coats. And a sealant.

32:56.520 --> 32:57.839
Unbelievable.

32:59.640 --> 33:03.110
Where the hell is she? What could
possibly be taking this long?

33:35.800 --> 33:37.233
Hart, is that you?

33:37.440 --> 33:40.477
I'm in a dress, I have gel in my hair,
I haven't slept...

33:40.680 --> 33:43.877
...l'm starved and I'm armed.
Don't mess with me.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.156
I'm fine. I'm cool. I'm good.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.790
Yeah, thas her.
Mr. Vic, nice work!

33:54.000 --> 33:55.115
Thank you.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.918
My God, I'm good.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.876
Okay, Gracie Lou, listen up.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.589
"Operation Thong" has commenced.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.598
Why don't you stun-gun yourself?

34:43.239 --> 34:45.036
I knew she'd like that one.

34:46.239 --> 34:47.355
Victor?

34:47.840 --> 34:49.512
Try not to speak.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.518
Victor!

34:52.400 --> 34:54.391
Miss Morningside, if is possible...

34:54.600 --> 34:56.636
...you look more radiant than ever.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.068
Then I guess is possible.
Hello.

35:00.440 --> 35:01.395
Hi.

35:03.560 --> 35:04.436
Miss Hart?!

35:05.040 --> 35:06.792
I mean, Miss Freebush.

35:07.880 --> 35:11.668
Victor, I see you haven't
completely lost your touch.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.677
You look absolutely perfect.

35:13.960 --> 35:17.157
And you're just in time
for the orientation breakfast.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.518
You'll take the bags to the room?

35:19.720 --> 35:21.836
Is been a while
since you've been with us...

35:22.040 --> 35:24.235
...but you remember
how everything goes.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.077
One little mistake
and I'm a bloody bellhop.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.796
Ohio. Oh-hi-yo!

35:32.080 --> 35:33.957
Washington. Nice apples.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.993
Original. You come up with that
all by yourself?

35:38.560 --> 35:40.994
- Miss Freebush!
- I got it. I got it.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.156
New Jersey? Welcome.

35:54.160 --> 35:56.720
- Who's she?
- Have you seen her before?

36:00.040 --> 36:02.634
Oh, hey, New Jersey?
This one's empty.

36:04.960 --> 36:05.949
Thanks.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.594
- I'm Cheryl from Rhode Island.
- Hi, I'm...

36:08.800 --> 36:12.349
Gracie Lou Freebush. I memorized
the orientation pamphlet.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.160
I know all 49 ladies
by name and picture.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.998
Fifty, including myself.

36:17.200 --> 36:21.193
Your picture wasn't there, so I knew
it was you from your lack of picture.

36:22.440 --> 36:25.637
How about a little song for the drive?

36:25.840 --> 36:28.229
I think you know the one I mean.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.639
Entering Barbie-town.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.239
We're up and running.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.032
I love my job!

36:57.240 --> 36:58.958
- Not a bad view.
- Not at all.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.509
There's our table!

37:01.800 --> 37:03.677
I got here three days early
so I could...

37:03.880 --> 37:06.519
Look at all the hoochie mama!

37:06.720 --> 37:07.914
Not the pastry!

37:09.720 --> 37:14.396
Ladies, I would like you to meet
Gracie Lou Freebush from New Jersey.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.716
Karen Krantz, New York.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.148
Whas up, Jersey?

37:18.360 --> 37:21.079
- Mary Jo Wright, Texas.
- Hi there.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.236
Belinda Brown, Tennessee.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.634
- I like that!
- Oh, yeah!

37:25.120 --> 37:26.917
Leslie Davis, California.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.030
Hey, girl.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.435
And Alana Krewson, Hawaii.

37:31.040 --> 37:31.836
Aloha.

37:32.040 --> 37:33.359
Aloha to you too!

37:33.560 --> 37:38.031
I want you all to know, I believe what
it says on the sign at the Alamodome.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.832
We are all winners.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.515
Hey, Hart! You think she's hungry?

37:42.720 --> 37:46.030
Most important, we're getting our
issues out there for people to hear.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.834
And is an honor
to have made it this far.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.395
Especially when you're
from a small state...

37:51.640 --> 37:53.198
Thas so true!

37:53.400 --> 37:55.709
- Us Rhode Islanders...
- I wasn't finished.

37:57.680 --> 37:58.908
Did it sound like I was?

37:59.120 --> 38:00.189
I'm sorry.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.516
Why are you apologizing to her?

38:02.720 --> 38:04.676
She's been drinking
too much Coppertone.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.269
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, I am.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.229
Question:

38:10.360 --> 38:13.750
In Hawaii, don't you use "Aloha"
for hello and goodbye?

38:14.280 --> 38:15.633
So?

38:16.320 --> 38:19.392
If you're on the phone with
someone who won't stop talking...

38:19.600 --> 38:21.955
...and you say "aloha,"
don't they start again?

38:28.400 --> 38:30.391
At least she thinks I'm funny.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.831
Hart? Hart, do you copy?

38:33.920 --> 38:36.115
- Whas up?
- I don't know. Is not working.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.835
- It worked five minutes ago.
- Who put it together?

38:44.560 --> 38:46.596
Check one, check one...

38:48.960 --> 38:51.394
Thank you so much. Thank you.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.638
For the past 21 years...

38:53.840 --> 38:57.071
...it has been my honor to serve
as director of this pageant.

38:57.280 --> 39:00.750
And I know that this year will be
our most exciting event ever!

39:03.920 --> 39:06.070
Couple of geniuses I'm working with.

39:06.280 --> 39:10.114
After the rehearsal and a photo shoot,
you can settle into your rooms.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.596
Tomorrow we will
begin the preliminaries...

39:13.800 --> 39:16.109
...hosted by our
master of ceremonies...

39:16.320 --> 39:19.118
...an American institution,
Stan Fields.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.514
Thank you! Oh, thank you, Kathy!

39:28.040 --> 39:30.031
Les go! Get it back online!

39:30.240 --> 39:31.673
- We're working on it.
- We're trying.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.313
Thank you, Kathy.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.630
Isn't she ravishing?!

39:36.760 --> 39:38.637
How does she do it?

39:38.840 --> 39:43.516
I look in the mirror and say,
"Who's that old man in my pajamas?"

39:46.600 --> 39:50.752
And even though I'll be
retiring this year...

39:52.680 --> 39:55.353
Well, don't cry for me... Alabama.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.719
Thas so sad. He's retiring.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.638
He's not retiring.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.673
I spoke to him this morning,
and he blurted it out.

40:03.880 --> 40:08.078
They're firing him, going
for someone newer and younger.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.270
I hope is Ricky Martin.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.199
Jesus Christ!

40:25.640 --> 40:29.679
I'm sorry. I had a bite of my bagel
and I forgot to pray.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.510
Dear Jesus, please forgive me...

40:35.720 --> 40:39.076
...for not praying before I had
a bite of my bagel and schmeer.

40:39.280 --> 40:40.508
Thank you very much.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.228
Amen.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.318
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

41:40.520 --> 41:42.829
Oh, no, I was just, you know...

41:43.200 --> 41:44.315
...grooming.

41:44.520 --> 41:47.193
I made some of my famous
hot chocolate.

41:52.160 --> 41:55.869
My roommate's asleep,
or she's starting to mold.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.670
But do you want to come in?

42:08.440 --> 42:10.317
I asked some of the other girls...

42:10.560 --> 42:13.438
...but when they heard "chocolate"
they slammed their doors.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.274
They didn't give me a chance
to say "nonfat."

42:17.720 --> 42:19.392
Well, here's to...

42:20.080 --> 42:21.433
...world peace.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.399
World peace.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.150
Hot.

42:31.360 --> 42:32.429
I'm sorry.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.718
I have to tell you...

42:34.920 --> 42:39.072
...I thought it was really great
how you settled that argument today.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.231
"Aloha, aloha."

42:41.440 --> 42:43.078
Thas why you're gonna win.

42:43.560 --> 42:45.073
You're so clever.

42:45.280 --> 42:48.556
You should tell jokes for your talent.
What is your talent?

42:49.680 --> 42:52.035
Is... Is kind of like...

42:52.400 --> 42:55.039
Is, you know,
is like a surprise.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.714
But don't worry,
is nothing embarrassing.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.118
Not anything like baton twirling
or anything.

43:05.120 --> 43:07.190
So, whas your talent?

43:09.520 --> 43:11.715
Oh, Cheryl, I'm sorry.

43:12.960 --> 43:15.679
Twirling can be a real art.

43:15.880 --> 43:19.236
I saw this cheerleader doing it
at a football game.

43:19.440 --> 43:23.149
She lit her batons on fire
and did this sexy dance.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.237
I wish I could do something like that.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.429
Why can't you?

43:26.680 --> 43:29.319
My parents don't like
anything ostentatious.

43:29.560 --> 43:31.755
And they really don't like fire.

43:33.680 --> 43:37.912
Cheryl, I think you have as good
a chance as anyone to win.

43:38.120 --> 43:40.998
You believe in yourself
to have gotten this far, right?

43:41.800 --> 43:43.358
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:46.440 --> 43:49.876
You're so nice and so smart
and so sensitive.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.752
You're definitely gonna win.

43:51.960 --> 43:52.870
Thas it.

43:53.320 --> 43:57.154
Excuse me. I am in the middle
of a REM cycle over here.

43:57.360 --> 43:58.918
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

44:29.160 --> 44:31.196
Not happening.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.231
- What?
- You took your earpiece out.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.919
- Vic needs you.
- Now?

44:39.120 --> 44:41.680
- I haven't slept in two days!
- I'll give you a cookie.

44:42.120 --> 44:43.997
It better be a big one.

44:46.240 --> 44:48.515
You don't walk, you float.

44:48.720 --> 44:51.712
Gently descending,
you don't look down.

44:51.920 --> 44:55.549
Go back up and do it again.
Never, ever look down, okay?

44:55.760 --> 44:57.796
Thighs touching...

44:58.600 --> 45:00.591
- Touching, not clenching.
- I'm touching.

45:00.800 --> 45:04.634
There's a gap between knees and calves,
your calves and your ankles.

45:04.840 --> 45:08.276
Right now there's a huge gap between
my brain and my spinal cord.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.478
Here. Take these.

45:29.440 --> 45:30.953
What, no armored car?

45:31.240 --> 45:33.151
That would be in my other dress.

45:33.800 --> 45:37.713
What are you planning to do
for your talent? Sing? Dance?

45:38.080 --> 45:39.798
Chew with your mouth closed?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.195
I'll do whatever you want, Yoda.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.753
Oh, Lord.

45:45.320 --> 45:46.594
Agent Matthews!

45:46.920 --> 45:50.595
- This woman has no talent!
- Don't shout it in front of her.

45:50.800 --> 45:54.270
I wasn't told to provide a talent.
I can't do so in the next five hours!

45:54.600 --> 45:55.555
Wait a minute.

45:55.720 --> 45:57.073
What are you talking about?

45:57.280 --> 45:59.669
She'll be on-stage
with nothing to do...

45:59.880 --> 46:02.269
...but convert oxygen
into carbon dioxide!

46:02.520 --> 46:06.718
You said you couldn't make her pretty
in two days, but she's gorgeous.

46:06.920 --> 46:09.388
Compared to the car wreck
she was before.

46:09.640 --> 46:12.916
My duties are stated in a contract,
and I have fulfilled them.

46:13.120 --> 46:15.873
- You talent her up by tomorrow or...
- Are you threatening me?

46:16.080 --> 46:19.311
- Listen to me, you old fruitcake!
- How dare you, you cupcake!

46:19.560 --> 46:23.553
There's something I know how to do.
I haven't done it since high school...

46:23.760 --> 46:27.196
- You're not having sex on this stage.
- I didn't know it was an option.

46:27.400 --> 46:29.960
This thing,
I just have to call room service.

46:30.520 --> 46:31.669
Miss Hart.

46:31.880 --> 46:33.108
Please.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.630
Thank you. And the other one.

46:41.320 --> 46:42.389
Thank you.

46:49.120 --> 46:50.792
All right, all right, all right.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.629
Happy, you doughnut Nazi?

47:31.760 --> 47:34.399
Did I tell you Stan Fields
was getting fired?

47:34.640 --> 47:37.996
I'm on it. You just concentrate
on being Gracie Lou, all right.

47:38.760 --> 47:41.274
And by the way,
you're doing a great job.

47:41.920 --> 47:44.070
I thought the evening gown looked...

47:45.160 --> 47:47.993
- I totally bought it.
- I know, you think I'm gorgeous.

47:48.200 --> 47:49.633
I don't think you're gorgeous.

47:49.960 --> 47:52.520
You think I'm gorgeous.

47:52.760 --> 47:55.035
You want to kiss me.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.798
You want to hug me...

47:57.000 --> 47:59.355
McDonalďs more feminine.
I'd rather kiss him.

47:59.600 --> 48:02.797
- Love me.
You want to hug me.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.558
You want to smooch me.

48:14.120 --> 48:15.712
Enjoy the rest of your night.

48:29.120 --> 48:31.236
Gracie, you look so tired.

48:31.800 --> 48:33.791
Oh, she had a busy night.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.833
I saw that gentleman stop by the room.

48:37.040 --> 48:37.995
Gentleman?

48:40.400 --> 48:44.109
- No men in the room.
- Is different on the mainland.

48:44.320 --> 48:47.278
Hold on, ladies. Les hear
her side of the story.

48:47.560 --> 48:48.959
You sleeping with a judge?

48:53.040 --> 48:54.598
Oh, that guy?

48:55.560 --> 48:58.870
No, no, I was dating him
for a little while because...

48:59.080 --> 49:01.275
...he said he had
an incurable disease.

49:04.320 --> 49:06.550
I didn't realize it was stupidity.

49:06.760 --> 49:08.830
Oh, I know what thas like.

49:09.040 --> 49:10.632
He is such a pathetic loser.

49:10.840 --> 49:14.628
I'm sorry he's obsessed with me,
but at some point is like, "Hello!"

49:14.840 --> 49:17.513
"Move on! Get over yourself!"

49:18.240 --> 49:19.992
His ego is this big.

49:20.200 --> 49:22.714
But his equipment is like this big!

49:23.800 --> 49:26.075
Good cover!
We worked that out together.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.958
Use it for a needle.

49:28.160 --> 49:30.276
Back to work.
Get ready for the Alamo.

49:31.920 --> 49:33.956
Thank you. Thank you.

49:34.280 --> 49:38.751
And welcome to
the Miss United States Preliminary...

49:38.960 --> 49:42.111
...here at the beautiful
and historical Alamo!

49:44.600 --> 49:46.636
Prepare for what promises to be...

49:46.840 --> 49:50.594
...a day of astounding musical,
theatrical and dancing talent.

49:50.800 --> 49:53.439
And after I'm finished,
you can see the ladies.

49:53.680 --> 49:54.590
Oh, yes!

49:57.040 --> 49:58.598
And now, put it together...

49:58.800 --> 50:02.270
...for Miss Mary Jo Wright from Texas!

50:38.160 --> 50:39.912
Whas her talent, bartending?

51:03.840 --> 51:08.550
I made it very clear you weren't
responsible for making her credible.

51:11.240 --> 51:13.390
I wish I could explain...

51:13.840 --> 51:16.195
...but there are no words.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.994
Eagle-Eye.

51:30.880 --> 51:33.440
You might want to check out
cowboy at 1:00.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.555
My 1:00 or your 1:00?

51:36.800 --> 51:38.995
The one under the white Stetson.

51:39.240 --> 51:41.231
There's Stetsons everywhere.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.628
He's moving, he's moving.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.878
- Toward the stage.
- Hold on, we're checking it out.

51:55.120 --> 51:57.429
Guys, he has a gun. He has a gun.

51:58.320 --> 52:00.629
Who's got the 20 on the shooter?

52:02.640 --> 52:03.675
I'm taking him out.

52:03.880 --> 52:05.233
Wait for a visual!

52:07.200 --> 52:09.760
Gun! Gun! Everybody down!

52:13.520 --> 52:15.988
Better up to them, don't you think?

52:17.680 --> 52:20.831
In a bizarre incident at the
Miss United States Preliminaries...

52:21.040 --> 52:24.032
...the contestant from New Jersey
leapt off -stage...

52:24.240 --> 52:28.028
...and tackled a man in the crowd
who was trying to light a cigarette.

52:28.240 --> 52:30.549
She's here with me right now.

52:30.760 --> 52:33.957
What were you thinking when you
jumped off the stage?

52:34.160 --> 52:38.438
All the contestants are actively
involved in ending tobacco dependence.

52:38.640 --> 52:42.997
I think the gentleman will think twice
before he lights up again.

52:43.200 --> 52:44.838
I'm sure we all will.

52:49.560 --> 52:51.312
- Look, he had a gun.
- Of course.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.118
This is Texas, everyone has a gun.

52:53.320 --> 52:54.878
My florist has a gun.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.189
I don't have a gun.

52:56.440 --> 52:57.998
My ancestors were Quakers.

52:58.200 --> 53:00.077
Stan, please!

53:00.400 --> 53:02.914
We assume any man
with a weapon is a suspect.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.678
We got the DNA results.

53:04.880 --> 53:07.872
The envelope from the Citizen
was licked by a woman.

53:08.120 --> 53:09.838
There's never been DNA before.

53:10.360 --> 53:12.635
He slipped up, or I should say "she."

53:12.840 --> 53:14.432
This is preposterous.

53:14.800 --> 53:16.791
You people are completely clueless.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.231
If I ran my pageant like this, we'd be
holding it in someone's basement!

53:20.440 --> 53:23.432
Every operation is bound
to have its screwups.

53:23.680 --> 53:25.989
As far as I can see,
she's still with us.

53:27.440 --> 53:28.555
Oh, God!

53:28.800 --> 53:31.792
Could I have a moment alone
with Miss Hart, please?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.115
Sure.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.672
Just for a tiny minute.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.389
We'll just be a moment.
Shop talk.

53:40.600 --> 53:41.635
Hair, gel, mousse.

53:43.960 --> 53:47.316
Look, I know I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

53:49.880 --> 53:53.634
I've been fighting all my life
against your type.

53:53.840 --> 53:56.718
The ones who think we're
a bunch of worthless airheads.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.429
You know who I mean.

53:58.680 --> 53:59.999
Feminists...

54:00.200 --> 54:01.633
...intellectuals...

54:01.840 --> 54:02.909
...ugly women.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.715
I refuse to give in to their cynicism.

54:06.080 --> 54:10.358
Thas why I have dedicated
my entire life to this scholarship.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.558
No one's going to ruin that.

54:13.520 --> 54:14.873
Not this year.

54:15.680 --> 54:18.114
You get in my way, I will kill you.

54:19.720 --> 54:20.948
Do you understand?

54:22.040 --> 54:22.995
Yeah.

54:23.800 --> 54:24.915
Yes.

54:34.560 --> 54:35.515
Frank!

54:36.320 --> 54:40.836
The interview is the single most
important part of the pageant.

54:41.040 --> 54:43.634
It accounts for 30%
of your total score.

54:43.840 --> 54:46.070
Whas the other 70%, cleavage?

54:47.800 --> 54:51.270
Is this your idea of doing final preps
on the convention center?

54:51.880 --> 54:54.952
Look. Liberace's got her
in a nice evening gown.

54:55.400 --> 54:59.712
McDonald called. He saw Hars anti-
smoking commercial. He's on his way.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.270
Good, perfect. I'd hate for him
to fire me over the phone.

55:03.520 --> 55:04.509
I can't believe this!

55:04.720 --> 55:05.675
Lll be ugly.

55:05.880 --> 55:06.869
No shit.

55:07.360 --> 55:09.555
I gotta do something.
I'm gonna go do laps.

55:09.760 --> 55:12.228
We'll go over tomorrow's assignments.

55:12.440 --> 55:13.509
You got it.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.119
Hands folded...

55:15.840 --> 55:17.637
...ankles crossed.

55:17.840 --> 55:18.909
Neck up!

55:19.120 --> 55:21.031
And remember, smile.

55:21.240 --> 55:24.710
Smilers wear a crown,
losers wear a frown.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.634
I would so love to hurt you right now.

55:27.840 --> 55:30.229
As long as you smile.

55:30.680 --> 55:31.669
Now...

55:32.160 --> 55:34.390
Why is New Jersey called...

55:34.680 --> 55:35.749
...the Garden State?

55:36.000 --> 55:40.278
You can't fit "Oil and petrochemical
refinery state" on a license plate?

55:40.520 --> 55:42.875
I don't appreciate your immaturity...

55:43.080 --> 55:44.911
...when I'm working as hard as I am.

55:45.120 --> 55:48.556
Whas the big deal?
Is fixed, I'm in the Top Five.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.591
Congratulations to me.

55:50.800 --> 55:55.351
Is that enough? Have you no pride
in yourself, in your presentation?

55:55.600 --> 55:59.354
I'm an FBI agent, right? I'm not
a performing monkey in heels.

55:59.560 --> 56:02.074
You're also a person,
and an incomplete one at that!

56:02.280 --> 56:05.716
In place of friends and relationships,
you have sarcasm and a gun.

56:05.920 --> 56:07.035
Oh, I have sarcasm?

56:07.240 --> 56:10.596
When every word that comes out of your
mouth is dripping with disdain?

56:10.880 --> 56:15.158
That is because I am a miserable,
grumpy elitist, and that works for me.

56:15.360 --> 56:18.079
I don't have relationships
because I don't want them.

56:18.280 --> 56:21.716
And I don't have friends
because I work 24-7.

56:21.920 --> 56:25.117
And you have no idea why I am
the way that I am.

56:25.320 --> 56:28.278
As we're practicing interviews,
why are you the way you are?

56:28.520 --> 56:30.158
None of your damn business.

56:30.360 --> 56:33.079
The judges probably have
never heard that before.

56:33.280 --> 56:35.157
We have more to do here.

56:37.120 --> 56:38.951
No, we are finished.

56:40.320 --> 56:41.594
Finished.

56:44.040 --> 56:47.157
- Give me a 20 on Matthews.
- Be advised he's at the pool.

56:50.760 --> 56:52.955
"How do you feel about gun control?"

56:53.240 --> 56:54.559
Favorable.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.954
Thought I'd let you know
I was quitting. Take care.

57:06.600 --> 57:08.352
Hold on. Wait a minute.

57:08.960 --> 57:11.952
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you got the wrong girl.

57:12.160 --> 57:13.070
All right?

57:13.280 --> 57:14.429
I do not need this now.

57:14.680 --> 57:18.195
Thas what I'm saying!
I'm totally screwing up in there!

57:18.400 --> 57:20.550
I don't feel
like a real agent anymore.

57:20.760 --> 57:23.149
I mean, Vic says
this thing thas so...

57:23.720 --> 57:26.792
I don't care what he said, you know?
I don't care.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.433
Because I am the job...

57:28.680 --> 57:31.114
...and I'm okay with that.
You're the job?

57:31.560 --> 57:33.551
Yeah, I'm the job.
We're all the job.

57:33.760 --> 57:35.591
Then whas wrong with me?

57:35.800 --> 57:39.315
I date. I know everyone thinks
I haven't had a date in 10 years.

57:39.560 --> 57:40.754
Is that what you think?

57:41.600 --> 57:42.874
I think you date.

57:43.080 --> 57:44.513
Damn right I do.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.956
But both times it was screwed up.

57:48.160 --> 57:50.390
I don't even care.
All I want to do...

57:50.600 --> 57:52.352
...is my job.

57:52.600 --> 57:55.637
For the last three days
I feel like I'm completely lost.

57:55.880 --> 57:58.553
I've been waiting five years
to run my own op.

57:58.760 --> 58:01.672
- Would I blow it on the wrong girl?
- You picked me...

58:01.880 --> 58:04.713
...because I looked good
and wasn't on maternity leave.

58:04.920 --> 58:07.832
No, thas why they let me pick you.
Know why?

58:08.040 --> 58:09.712
- Lost a bet.
- You're smart...

58:09.920 --> 58:14.152
...and funny and you're easy
to talk to when you're unarmed.

58:15.080 --> 58:18.117
Give yourself a break
and cut Vic some slack.

58:18.320 --> 58:20.675
Because if they see
what I see, then...

58:22.000 --> 58:23.194
...they'll love you.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.319
So, what do you say?

58:34.400 --> 58:35.674
I won't let you down.

58:35.920 --> 58:37.558
Good, thas what I want to hear.

58:37.760 --> 58:40.672
In all honesty, I might let you down.

58:40.920 --> 58:43.992
But I'll try my best not to.

58:47.120 --> 58:48.519
Do not mess with the dress.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.560
Oh, Vic is gonna kill you.

58:58.520 --> 59:00.078
You in big trouble.

59:00.280 --> 59:01.838
Why? You fell.

59:02.040 --> 59:03.519
- You look good wet.
- Shut up!

59:16.960 --> 59:19.793
Whoa, guys, Hars
in the dressing room. Come on.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.992
- You see the legs on that girl?
- Who's your daddy?

59:38.400 --> 59:39.958
Those better be candy dishes!

59:40.520 --> 59:41.430
Turn around.

59:43.840 --> 59:45.068
Open.

59:46.600 --> 59:48.955
This guy's like an inch from death!

59:50.160 --> 59:52.196
But what a way to go!

59:52.400 --> 59:54.994
- Break it up. Nothing to see.
- What do you mean?

59:55.440 --> 59:57.032
She's a federal agent.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.952
Guess is time to apply
at my local Hooters.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.830
Hemorrhoid ointment? You think
the judges will look that closely?

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.110
Is for the baggies under your eyes.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.395
Really?

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.228
Good, hair spray.
Finally something I recognize.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.633
What are you doing?

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.910
It stops the suit from riding up.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.075
Riding up where?

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.197
Just up!

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.355
Thas enough!

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.959
Why do you make things hard?

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.516
I can see this is an incredibly
embarrassing situation for you.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.036
Why does Georgia get to wear
a one-piece and I have to wear this?!

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:36.028
If you can do this, then you can
convince anyone that you belong here.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.753
Places, everybody! Les go!

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.080
The Swimsuit Preliminary accounts
for 15% of the total score...

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.716
...and tests the grace,
athleticism and poise...

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.309
...of each lovely woman.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.232
The last time I was naked in public,
I came out of a uterus.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.512
I don't have breasts, my thighs...
I should wear a muumuu.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.870
I have avoided this experience
all my life.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.753
And here it is.
You must achieve a Zen-like state.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.428
Listen to your breathing,
feel your heart...

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.432
...think of the Dalai Lama.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.834
Texas!

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.555
Rhode Island!

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.833
New Jersey!

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.034
Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama...

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.074
New York!

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.633
California!

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.199
I would have to say,
world peace.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.834
Definitely, world peace.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.714
Thas easy. World peace.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.030
World peace.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.916
What is the one most important thing
our society needs?

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.158
That would be harsher punishment
for parole violators, Stan.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.077
And, world peace.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.553
Thank you, Gracie Lou.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.318
And thank you, Stan.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.193
Cheryl Frasier from Rhode Island.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.236
That was charming. Are you drunk?

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.558
Glad you enjoyed it. Now excuse me,
I have to go unscrew my smile.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.512
We got a lead.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.551
- The blood test?
- Photos.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.593
Cheryl Frasier, with members
of a radical animal rights group...

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.155
...involved in bombings.
- Is always the quiet ones.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.318
She fits the profile:
Loner, introverted.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.073
That Cheryl?

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.716
Describe your perfect date.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.872
Thas a tough one.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.318
I'd have to say April 25th...

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.757
...because is not too hot,
not too cold.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.394
All you need is a light jacket.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.675
Now, there is a hardened criminal.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.749
Maybe she's an accomplice.
Maybe she's his inside connection.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.030
Thas what you gotta find out.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.195
How?

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.709
Buddy up to her, you know, girl talk.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.036
- Girl talk?
- Yes, girl talk.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.157
Sorry, I'm totally drawing a blank.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.797
Leg waxing, fake orgasms,
the inability of men to commit.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.353
Why don't you talk to her?

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.315
Lmagine she's me and you want to know,
but I don't want to talk about it.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.834
What would you do?

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.639
You want me to beat her?

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.309
Why don't you talk to her?

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.755
Okay, forget about it. I will go.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.958
Put that back in your ear.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.196
I can't talk girl talk
with a guy in my head.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.436
I can't even do it with me in my head.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.679
Girl talk.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.679
Oh, my God!

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.155
Hey, Rhode Island, how you doing?

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.397
How can you ask that?
You heard my interview.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.390
I was like a female Rain Man.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.433
Oh, no, it definitely
wasn't Rain Man.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.073
Definitely not Rain Man.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.954
Come and have a midnight snack
with me and some...

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.468
...girl talk.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.592
Are you crazy?
We can't have pizza and beer!

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.360
Do you know how many calories
you're talking about?

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.114
Is light beer and
she's gonna throw it up anyway.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.196
Come on.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.955
Come with. No?

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.673
No takers? No?

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.952
All right, I'll just...

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:04.311
...sit here. You guys
go back on your bicycles...

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:08.593
...and I'll sit here with my
very large, cheesy pizza.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.916
Oh, look at all that cheese.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.191
Cheryl, don't.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.595
At least scrape off the toppings.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.349
First step, pizza.
Second step, flaming batons...

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.310
I guess we'll be needing more pizza.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.516
I want another drink!

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.512
We're gonna get a drink.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.951
Another round, ladies?

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.148
- I can't do another one!
- Yes, you can!

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.834
This is so weird!

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.679
This is my third one
and I don't feel a thing!

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.756
Really?

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.269
Like when I did my interview question.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.272
Don't worry, we all sucked.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.155
You know, I had such a good answer
to that question too.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.397
My idea of a perfect date
would be a man...

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.676
...who takes me to a romantic dinner.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.952
Then we walk along the beach barefoot,
discussing books...

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.958
...and music and movies!

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.839
No wonder you're still a virgin.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.149
Time to paint. Come on.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.873
No, my contacts.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.231
- We'll stay here.
- I want more pizza.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.556
We're gonna have more pizza and beer.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.274
Have fun!

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.678
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah, is fun.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.836
Is so fun it should be illegal.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.879
Speaking of illegal,
have you ever, like...

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.399
...committed a crime?

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.748
Yes!

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.398
Yes, I did.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.675
Go on.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.436
One time I stole red underwear
from the department store.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.352
My mother wouldn't buy them!

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.194
She said they were Satan's panties.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.876
- So is that it?
- Yeah.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.197
Oh, there was
this one thing in college...

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.277
...with my Lit professor.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:49.196
One day I came to his office. He said
he wanted to discuss a paper I wrote.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.509
He wanted to discuss a paper, right?

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.359
Hey, can I get another
one of these tubie things?

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.437
Yeah, can we get another tubie?

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.516
Anyway, he attacked me.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.395
Cheryl, did you report him?

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.552
No, I never told anyone before this.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.990
I know that happens all the time.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.395
No, it doesn't! Cheryl, it doesn't.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.398
There are so many maneuvers
that I could show you.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.709
Really?

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.036
Yeah! Come on, get up.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.109
I want you to firmly plant your feet.

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:25.912
I'm gonna move the chair.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.872
Now if someone comes at you...

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.950
She's completely trashed.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.390
We should get her back
before Miss Morningside finds out.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.359
Kathy's got a boot up her ass
about something.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.313
I don't think she ever
got over those rumors.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.629
Come again?

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.716
Her pageant years
she was a runner-up.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.718
But then the winner mysteriously
got food poisoning.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.069
Bizarro!

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:57.590
No, Stan told me she got a letter
a few weeks back from the network...

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.109
...and they're firing her too!

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:03.312
She threw a chair out the window!

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.352
We gotta go. Come on.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.109
I got 20 people here
waiting for confirmation.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.836
Don't tell me I don't understand.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.031
I hate when I don't see
a wet paint sign.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.354
Stop it. Listen.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.831
- Can't hear you, took out my earpiece.
- I have a lead and is not Cheryl.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.349
Forget it. They bagged the Citizen.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.158
What? Where?

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.313
Is confirmed.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.595
He was holing up in a shack in Nevada.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.435
Place had enough C4
to make a new Grand Canyon.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.398
Les pack up and get out of here.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.553
Sir, I need to talk to you.
One second of your time.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.678
Hear me out a second.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.919
I feel the situation bears further
scrutiny and our continued presence.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.237
Do you have paint in your ears?
We caught the guy!

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:54.318
I respect what you're saying.
I'd say the same to me...

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.357
...but what if we were wrong?

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.111
What if the Citizen didn't send it?
What if it was a copycat?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.275
The letter didn't follow
the normal pattern.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.556
The linguistic scheme
was uncharacteristic...

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.990
...and the DNA said it was a woman!

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.233
Maybe he got his girlfriend
to lick the envelope.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.635
I think we have reason
to monitor Morningside.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.071
Why don't you jump on her
dressed like a Bavarian fruitcake?

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.919
You're the reason I had
to drag myself down here...

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.236
...and I don't want to hear anymore!

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.034
You're absolutely right, sir.
Not another damn word.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.275
Thank you.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.757
But she's getting fired this year,
which she didn't tell us.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.838
You're already in enough
trouble with the review board.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.510
Yeah, but when she was in the pageant,
the only reason she won was...

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.269
...because the winner got
food poisoning. How bizarro is that?

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.669
"Bizarro"?

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.509
She threatened me. According to Mary
Jo, she has a history of violence.

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.869
Who is Mary Jo?

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.594
Are you getting your information
from a pajama party?

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.074
Would you shut up?

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.510
You're shutting up enough
for both of us.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.836
Is there any reason
to suspect Morningside?

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.510
No, sir.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.389
There.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.637
I request permission to stay
with a small contingent.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.636
Denied.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.314
Then I request permission
to stay alone.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.758
You know what, I don't care
what you do. You want to stay, stay!

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.111
But as a private citizen.
Turn in your badge and your gun.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.513
Everybody, I suggest we start packing.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.115
What?

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.396
Don't look at me like I betrayed you.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.517
Betrayal implies action.
You stood there.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.153
You got nothing to go on.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.430
I know everyone thinks I'm a screwup.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.990
But I feel like I'm in the right
place at the right time.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.158
I have to protect those girls.
It is my job.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.634
Part of it is following orders.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.549
The other part is using your brain.
Throw out the rule book...

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.672
I like the book. I like knowing
what I can and cannot do.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.916
You're not the only one who lives
for the job.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.998
I want to keep mine
for the next 20 or 30 years.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.713
Jesus, Hart.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.114
Give it a rest.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.038
Sure, give it a rest.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.154
What are you doing?

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.079
Don't do it.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.759
Thank you.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.796
Thank you so much.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.152
I can't believe it!

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.828
Hi, Mom.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.313
Don't do that!

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:13.633
That slow, creepy thing in the shadows.
Your father used to do that.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.875
Mom.

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.599
This isn't gonna work.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.709
Why, of course is going to work.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.832
The feds caught the Citizen.
We have no one to pin it on!

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.513
Okay, that was bad luck.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.759
But what about all these other letters
from terrorist groups threatening us?

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.473
"Women's Liberation Front."

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.997
"Islamic Jihad." They're not so nuts
about the Swimsuit Competition.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.475
Any one of these
could have planted a bomb.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.318
When did we get those?

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.910
I just finished writing them.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.111
Just like the Citizen letter.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.348
You're a genius.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.989
No, Frank. I'm just pissed off.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.395
Nobody fires me and gets away with it.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.676
They want a newer, hotter show...

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.949
...they're gonna get it.

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.073
Mom, you're a little scary.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.793
And you're a little bit sloppy.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.753
Tuck your shirt.
I don't want to tell you again.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.909
Les go home, honey.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.510
Mom?

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.914
Oops.

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.316
- Need a hand, boss?
- I got it.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.310
Okay, Vic. Beautify me.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.314
Hair, makeup, shellac, whatever
it is you do. That shiny stuff...

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.754
Where are you going?

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:48.078
Your Agent McDonald insists that I
depart, or I won't be compensated.

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.079
No. After the Top 10!
I am completely on my own.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.714
The FBI is gone, is not fixed.
I need you!

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.876
Not anymore. The cocoon is open.

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.913
I've taken a woman
without a smidgen of estrogen...

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.712
...and made her a lady.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.388
- Come on.
- I've never been prouder of myself.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.789
Or...

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.595
...of any girl I have ever coached.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.278
You are truly unique.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.232
If I ever had a daughter,
I imagine that she would be...

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.869
...something like you.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.718
Which is why I never reproduced.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.997
I have a really strong feeling
something will happen to these girls.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.792
You need to stay for me. Please.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.274
I can't.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.838
But I can leave you this.
I was saving it for tonight.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.515
Is your size, I believe.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.638
Good luck to you, Gracie Lou.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.638
Is been a privilege.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.438
No insults today?

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:07.874
You're a Don Ho.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.436
Has anyone seen Gracie? I can't
believe she missed dress rehearsal.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.916
Maybe she couldn't take the pressure.
She ate four slices last night.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:20.069
We all saw her glasses performance.
She is not making the Top 10!

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.957
I overslept my beauty sleep.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.754
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.510
I wonder which one of these...

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.074
...is lipstick.

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:34.275
Ladies!

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:59.114
Good luck, ladies! Keep it moving.
Les go!

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.355
Looking good, ladies.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.750
Will you go back to the mothership?

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.552
As long as you go with me, Tex-Ass.

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.752
Les go, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Texas...

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.795
I can't open the goddamn bottle.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.316
Have a good show. You guys excited?

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.149
Where are you going?

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.669
I forgot my breasts.
Hold on, I'll be back.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.508
Going live.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.678
In five, four, three...

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:38.037
Is the 75th Annual
Miss United States Pageant...

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.676
...live from San Antonio, Texas!

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.834
Good. Thas the one I use at home.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.559
And your host for the evening,
Stan Fields!

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.194
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.871
And welcome to a night of beauty,
talent and poise.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.435
I'm not just talking
about my cohost...

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.069
...Kathy Morningside!

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:06.559
- Hello, Kathy.
- Stan, you charmer.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.877
But you forgot to mention
"incredible intelligence."

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.992
That was incredibly stupid of me.
How can I make it up?

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.549
By helping me to announce
the Top 10...

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.719
...chosen based on their performance
during the preliminaries this week.

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.353
Here's the envelope.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.592
Thank you, Scott.
Ladies, hold your breath.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.679
Hawaii!

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.997
And we're following.
Come in for that reaction.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.237
- Go to two.
- Going to two.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.919
California!

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.189
New York!

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.510
Alaska!

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.833
Texas!

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.912
New Jersey!

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.430
Oh, shit!

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.228
That was graceful.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.998
That must have hurt.

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.431
But she's up and at it.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.432
And last but not least, Rhode Island.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:27.714
And there they are!
This year's Top 10 finalists.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.511
The Top 10 have been chosen.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.235
We'll be right back with tonighs
Swimsuit Competition.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.910
I checked out Kathy Morningside.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.350
- Anything?
- Not even a traffic ticket.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:51.957
Model citizen. Beauty contestant,
pageant director, loving mom.

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.355
- She's married?
- Widow. One son.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.478
A sniveling, obsequious
weasel of a human being.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.518
- You know her son?
- So do you. Is Frank.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:04.314
- Her assistant?
- Asshole Frank?

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.436
One and the same.

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.518
She never mentioned anything.
Anything come up on the CCH?

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.039
Nothing on Frank Tobin.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.310
There wouldn't be.
His name is Morningside.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:15.233
He changed it to cover
his many indiscretions.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.513
Wait. How do you know that?

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.789
I've been around this pageant
for many years.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.151
I could shock you with the intimate
details I'm privy to.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.272
Good job! Good job

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.559
I got you something.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.669
I couldn't...

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.348
You ate pizza, you stole panties,
you're wild.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.511
We worked on this, remember?

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.394
You're gonna be great.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.749
- Can I see your ticket?
- Federal officer.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.993
I'm with him.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.512
Gentlemen, you can't go in...

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.630
Victor!

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:49.914
He's with me.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.436
Wait. I'm not "with him" with him.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.198
Come on, muffin.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.990
Thank you! She certainly lit my fire.

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.915
Now you can wear Satan's panties!

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.951
- Hey, Hart.
- What are you doing here?

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.670
I think you might have been right.
Frank is Kathy Morningside's son.

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.359
Disgusting, perverted Frank?

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.750
He cleared under another name.
I ran a new CCH.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.394
DUI, assault, even a weapons charge.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.914
Are we doing full deployment?

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.680
McDonald didn't want to hear about it.
Is just us.

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.552
Good show, Mr. Tobin.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.036
You're up next, New Jersey.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.719
I gotta get my glasses.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.470
Hey! You're drinking my talent!

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.716
You got to make it into the Top Five!

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.558
- Can you whistle?
- No!

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.591
- Make hand puppets?
- No!

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.756
I had a girl who rearranged furniture.

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.315
You said all I have
is sarcasm and a gun.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.152
That and a right hook.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.716
And now, the musical stylings
of Gracie Lou Freebush.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:24.950
Good evening.

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.869
The program says I'm supposed to play
the water glasses for you...

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.513
...but the girls got dehydrated.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.195
No water glasses?

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.917
You want me to go to a commercial?

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.395
No, stay on her. Go with it.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:42.798
I believe no woman should be without
a basic knowledge of self-defense.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.913
So in order to show you this,
I'm gonna need a little help.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:51.075
I would like to bring out
my assistant, Eric Bob.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.873
More changes?
Follow her. Stay on her.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.799
- How to inflict damage
with the least amount of force.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:06.514
In some cases, your attacker might
come at you in a frontal assault.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.511
Use the heel of your hand and thrust.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.076
This will cause the nose to break
and your assailans eyes to tear...

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.838
...giving you a chance to get away.

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:23.874
All right. Les say your assailant
comes at you from behind.

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.678
Attack me!

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.080
Little Eric looks a little scared.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.515
Maybe he needs a little applause.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.992
She's kicking his ass!

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.758
You were the best queen ever.

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.996
Thank you, that is so sweet.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.714
Ladies, give Lori
some room to breathe.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.273
Go on, now.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.119
You need some powder.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.197
You don't have to hold
the crown all night.

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.755
My God, that is disgraceful.

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:15.915
Frank!

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:19.357
Take this to the prop master.
See if you can't get it to shine.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.354
If all else fails, go for the four
sensitive areas of the body.

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.152
But just remember to "sing."

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.191
S-l-N-G.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.871
Solar plexus, Instep...

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.071
...Nose, Groin!

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.395
Sing.

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.873
Cue Stan.

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.712
Welcome to the Garden State!

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:55.755
When we return, we'll find out
who those lucky Final Five are.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.599
Les go find Frank.

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.438
Take left. I'll take this side.

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.232
No. Evening gown, now.

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.875
Ladies! In one moment,
five of you...

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.275
...will be one step
closer to the crown.

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:20.155
And one of those five...

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.794
...is...

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.269
...California!

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.672
Leslie Williams is a music major.

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:33.509
She believes in the healing power
of music. Loves opera, reggae...

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.270
...and, like any true California girl,
the Beach Boys.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.039
Rhode Island!

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.958
Cheryl Frasier is a science major.
Her field is...

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.119
...nuclear fission with a minor
in elementary particles.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.228
Nebraska!

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:55.756
For Kelly Beth Kelly,
all the world is a stage.

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.877
A theater major...

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:01.914
...she helps run a drama program
for underprivileged children.

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.873
New Jersey!

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:08.555
Gracie Lou Freebush hopes
to become a pediatrician.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.955
Gracie, is you. Go!

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.312
Her hobbies include figure skating,
water ballet...

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:18.393
...and taking long,
luxurious bubble baths.

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.072
You go, Gracie Lou.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.074
And our fifth finalist:

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.157
Texas!

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:30.400
Mary Jo Wright is a psychology major.

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.751
In her spare time,
she works in a homeless shelter...

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.439
...and eats Mexican food.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.635
Thank you, ladies.
You were magnificent.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.631
I want all the lesbians to know...

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.035
...if I can make it to the Top 10,
so can you!

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.912
Big out to Brooklyn! Yo!

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.908
Get her off of there!

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.348
Go to Stan!

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.952
Tina, I love you, baby!

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.390
I love you, Karen!

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:09.671
And we'll be right back with our
final five lesbians. Interviews.

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.872
Bumper. Commercial.
Can we say "lesbians"?

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:14.593
You got a problem with that?

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.149
In a way, America is like a big ship.

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:22.512
When we work together
and respect each other...

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.228
...thas when the ship
gets safely home.

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.798
Terrific answer.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.035
Damn it.

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.068
New Jersey.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.233
As you may know,
there are many who consider...

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:41.389
...the Miss United States pageant
to be outdated and antifeminist.

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.358
What would you say to them?

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:44.914
Oh, my God.

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:48.157
I would have to say,
I used to be one of them.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.470
And then I came here...

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.193
...and I realized that...

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:58.757
...these women are smart,
terrific people...

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:03.351
...who are just trying to make
a difference in the world.

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.909
We've become really good friends.

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.032
I know we all secretly hope the other
one will trip and fall on her face...

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.554
Wait a minute!
I've already done that!

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.319
For me, this experience has been
one of the most rewarding...

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:28.274
...and liberating experiences
of my life.

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.672
My God.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.469
I did it.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.749
And if anyone...

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.434
...anyone...

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.030
...tries to hurt one
of my new friends...

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:44.993
...I would take them out.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.916
I would make them suffer so much,
they'd wish they were never born.

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:52.954
And if they ran,
I would hunt them down.

01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.555
Thank you, Kathy.

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.228
A brief, shining moment,
and then that mouth.

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.830
Helps if you pull it out.

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.037
Good luck, ladies.

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.356
I wanted to rub the crown for luck.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.158
Frank took it to get it polished.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.033
I'll have it by the time
they announce the winner.

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:23.679
My God! Is the crown!

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:25.836
Yes, it is. You can taste it now...

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.189
No, no, no!

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.676
Not the... This in the...

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.438
Finale positions.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:40.435
Yes. Wear the crown. Be the crown.
You are the crown.

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:50.554
And now, the moment
of truth and beauty.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.959
The envelope, please.

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:06.789
What?

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.711
A lot of tension.

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.712
The fourth runner-up is...

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.430
...California!

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:23.552
The third runner-up is...

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.154
...Nebraska!

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:37.554
- Am I in danger here?
- Wait here.

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.955
The second runner-up is Texas!

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.548
Drop it!

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.359
I mean it! Drop it!

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.589
This is it.

01:33:58.840 --> 01:33:59.795
The moment.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.834
One of these two ladies
will wear the crown.

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.677
Listen to me!

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.916
I'm gonna reach for my badge slow.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.872
You do, and you're dead.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.559
The first runner-up...

01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:17.877
...who will have to take the winner's
place if, for any reason...

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.991
...she cannot fulfill her duties is:

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.598
New Jersey! Which means...

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.074
...our new Miss United States is:

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:26.315
Don't take the crown.

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.118
Rhode Islanďs Cheryl Frasier!

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.788
Don't take the crown. Trust me.

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.719
Jersey's gone berserk!

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.633
Get her off the stage!

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.710
Gracie!

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.433
Okay.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.518
Good show, everybody.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.829
I was right in the middle of my song!

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:36.280
You got nothing on me.
This is ridiculous.

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:39.910
Where you're going, they'd love
to meet a former beauty queen.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:42.236
When he says meet, he means M-E-A-T.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.033
Miss Hart, you don't understand.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.755
All I'm guilty of is trying to make
the world a more beautiful place.

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.154
Look at yourself.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:54.352
When I met you, Dennis Rodman
looked better in a dress.

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.830
But now you're a lady! I did that.

01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:01.079
Vic did that, and a team of highly
specialized federal manicurists...

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.669
...and people who make you beautiful.

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:05.199
Get in the car.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.237
You think you saved something.

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:11.592
All you did was to destroy the dream
of young women all over the country.

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.358
Their dream is to get blown up?

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.477
You got a good shot
at that insanity plea.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.035
I earned it!

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.754
Years of bitching beauty
queens and what do I get?

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:23.714
Fired! They steal my life,
they steal my beauty pageant.

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.950
It is not a beauty pageant.
It is a scholarship program.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.593
Yeah, yeah.

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:30.750
"Yes."

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.556
Enjoy running the Miss San Antonio
Women's Correctional Facility Pageant!

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:46.875
Get it? The Women's Correctional...

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.593
That was good work.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.115
Right back at you.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:58.395
So, how does it feel?

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.877
Throwing the rule book
out of the window?

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.752
Pretty good, actually.

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:05.238
I was thinking...

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:06.759
...when we get back...

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:10.236
...after we write up our reports
and you get all ugly again...

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.591
...maybe we could have dinner?

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.155
What? You asking me out on a date?

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.432
No. Just a casual dinner.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.438
If we happen to have sex afterwards,
so be it.

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.678
You think I'm gorgeous.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.599
You want to date me...

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.519
...love me and marry me.

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.351
A part of you is gonna miss this.

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.670
The heels.
They do something for my posture.

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.950
I'm suddenly very aware
and proud of my breasts.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.435
- Funny, me too.
- Agent Matthews! Gracie!

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:53.954
Thank God you're still here.

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.673
There's been an emergency.

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.156
Somebody found some
sort of incendiary device.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.112
Come on, quickly!

01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:02.390
Excuse me. FBI.

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.679
She saved the pageant, she saved
our lives, and here she is!

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.194
Thas not gonna work for me.

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.428
I can't go up there!

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:14.954
It was his idea, Gracie Lou.

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:17.913
I'd never get you here unless
you could shoot someone.

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:19.838
You'll get yours, Henry Higgins.

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.033
Come on!

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:30.629
Ladies and gentlemen,
agent Gracie Hart of the FBI!

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.194
Not so fast!

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.392
Because even though
you're a federal officer...

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.189
...to us, you will always be
Gracie Lou Freebush.

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.030
The nicest, sweetest,
coolest girl at the pageant...

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.913
...and this year's Miss Congeniality!

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.676
I don't know what to say.

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:12.677
Except for...

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.758
...I can't wear this at work.

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:19.833
I never thought anything like
this would happen to me.

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.835
I kind of hoped it wouldn't.
But now that it has...

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:25.759
...I just want to say that...

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.313
...l'm very...

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:31.389
...very honored.

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:33.830
And...

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:35.989
...moved.

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:37.755
And...

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.912
...truly touched.

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.635
And...

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.397
...I really do want world peace.
