WEBVTT

00:33.658 --> 00:34.492
Mel?

00:34.576 --> 00:36.578
[tense music playing]

00:45.920 --> 00:46.755
Hey.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.217
Hey.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.845
[door opens]

02:08.002 --> 02:08.837
Mel?

02:10.171 --> 02:11.005
[Mel] Oh.

02:11.714 --> 02:12.882
Yeah. [groans]

02:14.259 --> 02:15.677
What are you doing out here?

02:17.387 --> 02:18.221
[sighs]

02:19.848 --> 02:21.850
[theme music playing]

02:30.775 --> 02:32.110
[Jack] It was that bad?

02:32.193 --> 02:33.444
No! No, it wasn't.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.822
I'm just a really light sleeper.
Thank you.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.324
If I was snoring so loudly,
why didn't you wake me up?

02:38.408 --> 02:41.953
'Cause you've been so stressed out,
and you were just dead asleep.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.290
So instead of waking me up,
you sleep in your car?

02:46.207 --> 02:48.293
I mean, I didn't do a lot of sleeping.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.045
That's it.
Tonight I'm gonna check into the B&B.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.047
Don't be ridiculous. I'll get earplugs.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.800
No. I don't want you to feel uncomfortable
because of me.

02:56.759 --> 03:00.263
-Wait, am I making you feel that way?
-You're not. You've been incredible.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.725
It's… me. I just-- [sighs]

03:06.394 --> 03:07.604
-What?
-[Jack sighs]

03:09.772 --> 03:11.482
Well, I've never lived with someone.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.568
You have.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.945
[inhales slowly] Okay.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.576
So what can I do to convince you
that I want you here?

03:24.078 --> 03:24.913
I don't know.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.666
I just feel like
I'm encroaching on your space, you know?

03:28.750 --> 03:29.709
But you're not.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.586
It feels like that.

03:33.254 --> 03:36.966
Come on. So it's normal for you
to just sleep in your car?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.760
[chuckles softly] No.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.181
What's normal is when you're living
with someone, there's a give and take.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.058
Fine.

03:46.476 --> 03:50.104
But next time I'm snoring,
will you just wake me up?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.189
Okay.

03:52.190 --> 03:56.778
But you should know, when it comes to you,
I don't care about personal space.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.905
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

03:59.572 --> 04:00.949
-Like now?
-Mm-hmm.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.454
[giggling]

04:07.413 --> 04:08.957
[video crackling]

04:09.040 --> 04:11.876
[glitching] Oh, I miss you too, Vernon.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.922
Oh, I am just so glad
that you are in one piece.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.257
[laughs]

04:17.340 --> 04:18.549
How is your Aunt Nancy?

04:18.633 --> 04:21.177
The hurricane didn't kill her,
but I almost did.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.929
[laughs] Wow! Why? What happened?

04:23.012 --> 04:27.183
First of all, she refused to evacuate.
Luckily, her neighbor Pete came over

04:27.267 --> 04:29.310
and offered to let us stay
in his safe room.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.397
I wasn't sure the three of us
were gonna make it back to his house.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.940
Why not?

04:34.023 --> 04:37.193
Because while we were
pushing my aunt's wheelchair

04:37.277 --> 04:39.279
through 100-mile-per-hour winds,

04:39.362 --> 04:42.740
she had a fit
about leaving her bird feeder behind.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.784
She kept demanding that we take her home,

04:44.867 --> 04:46.995
and at one point,
accused us of kidnapping her.

04:47.078 --> 04:51.332
Oh, well, it sounds like we owe Pete
a big old bucket of gratitude.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.250
[Hope] Yeah.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.294
But I think I need to stay for a bit.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.547
Nancy's got a yard full of branches,
and… [sighs]

04:57.630 --> 04:59.424
…she's refusing to hire help.

04:59.507 --> 05:02.093
Do you want me to come down there
and give you a hand?

05:02.176 --> 05:05.763
[Hope] No, no. The airports are a mess.
I'd worry about you,

05:05.847 --> 05:08.308
and my heart's had about
all the stress it can take.

05:08.391 --> 05:11.936
Okay, listen, as long as you are not
putting yourself in harm's way,

05:12.020 --> 05:13.771
you can stay as long as you want.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.607
There is one thing
I need you to do for me in the meantime.

05:16.691 --> 05:17.734
Yeah, you name it.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.986
Send out the Virgin River Quarterly.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.322
Got it. And how many are there?

05:22.405 --> 05:24.115
3,982.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.533
[laughs]

05:25.616 --> 05:26.701
You're kidding me?

05:26.784 --> 05:28.703
[Hope] And I need them mailed out ASAP.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.496
Wh… what is the rush?

05:30.580 --> 05:35.918
This edition has a last-minute reminder
about the upcoming Lumberjack Games.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.962
Well, couldn't I just put up some flyers?

05:38.046 --> 05:41.257
Vernon, all the money we raise
goes to the food bank.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.593
We need the whole town to show up.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.721
I wanna be clear. I am not equipped

05:46.804 --> 05:50.183
to take over running
the Lumberjack Games in your absence.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.392
[Hope] Don't worry.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.896
Carol Fleming's in charge this year.
I'm just a figurehead.

05:54.979 --> 05:55.938
Good.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.232
[glitching] Although… give a welcome--

05:58.316 --> 05:59.817
Hey, Hope?

06:09.702 --> 06:12.413
[cell phone ringing]

06:16.334 --> 06:17.293
Where's Jimmy?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.962
They brought him in this morning.
He's in a holding cell.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.798
-Have you questioned him?
-Not yet.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.425
But I have the interview room
booked for this afternoon.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.220
Well, I wanna see him. Face-to-face.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.389
[Mike] You know
I can't let you do that, Jack.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.599
He hasn't asked for a lawyer yet,
but he might,

06:31.682 --> 06:34.852
and I don't want him walking free
'cause I broke protocol.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.940
All right, Mike, let me talk to him,
and I'll know if he's our guy.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.234
[Mike] Jack, I got this.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.361
You know I'm right.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.155
Yeah, I do, but my hands are tied.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.826
Look, I'll call you
after the interview, okay?

06:51.744 --> 06:53.538
Sure. Thanks.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.214
[keypad beeps]

07:05.925 --> 07:07.760
Hey, Preach. Uh, listen.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.929
I've got an errand
I gotta run this afternoon.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.056
I need you to cover, okay? Call me back.

07:16.060 --> 07:16.894
[sniffs]

07:17.520 --> 07:21.774
[cell phone ringing]

07:22.733 --> 07:23.568
Hey.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.403
Hi, I haven't been able to reach you.

07:25.486 --> 07:28.030
I even left a message
on the clinic's answering machine.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.365
[Mel] Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.742
The reception out here
is less than stellar.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.498
Hey, Joey, are you okay?

07:38.207 --> 07:39.167
[Joey sighs]

07:39.250 --> 07:40.543
Joe, talk to me.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.003
[Joey sighs heavily]

07:42.795 --> 07:46.132
[Joey] The hearing
to finalize my divorce is set.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.092
Oh, honey.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.722
-I thought you wanted this?
-I want the divorce.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.100
I do. I just-- I don't wanna be divorced.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.478
And you know what the worst part is?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.857
I am gonna be alone
for the rest of my life,

08:02.940 --> 08:04.650
and he's already got a girlfriend.

08:04.734 --> 08:08.779
Well, I thought that was just a,
you know, midlife crisis?

08:09.405 --> 08:11.365
[Joey] Yeah, well,
he took this one to Maui.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.576
How do you know that?

08:13.659 --> 08:15.786
Because there's a million pictures
on Instagram,

08:15.870 --> 08:20.875
courtesy of Ariel, who was born in 1995
and lists "glassblower" as her occupation.

08:20.958 --> 08:24.212
-For real?
-That is not something I could make up.

08:24.837 --> 08:28.341
Ugh. Okay,
the first thing I need you to do

08:28.424 --> 08:30.551
is stop looking at Instagram.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.638
He wants her to meet the kids.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.139
I mean, my kids.

08:35.890 --> 08:36.724
[Mel] Wow.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.020
I just don't think I can face him alone.

08:41.103 --> 08:44.732
You don't have to. I…
I'm gonna come to the hearing, okay?

08:44.815 --> 08:48.611
And afterwards, we'll go and drink
lots and lots of sake at Roku.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.156
[Mel] I will be by your side
the entire time.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.076
Okay. Thank you.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.413
-[sighs] God, I feel like such a wimp.
-No.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.290
This is a big change.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.919
But it's what's best for you and the kids.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.004
[doorbell rings]

09:08.297 --> 09:12.051
Oh, listen, Bill's here.
He's here to pick up the kids. I gotta go.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.261
Sure. Yeah.

09:14.303 --> 09:18.558
Just hang in there, okay? I love you.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.767
I love you too.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.772
[phone beeps]

09:25.481 --> 09:26.482
[sighs]

09:57.179 --> 09:58.055
[phone beeps]

09:58.139 --> 10:02.018
Hi, Dr. Mullins. This is Julia.
I know you said not to call this number,

10:02.101 --> 10:05.521
but I left a message on your cell,
and I still haven't heard back.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.316
Unfortunately, your two o'clock interview
had to cancel

10:08.399 --> 10:10.610
but is still very interested
in the position.

10:11.235 --> 10:14.530
Please call me to reschedule
and so that I know you got my message.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.489
Thanks.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.621
-Cord wrapping.
-Yes.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.039
-Good Lord.
-It looks good.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.874
[chuckling]

10:24.957 --> 10:29.253
Well, bakery truck is being serviced,
so Lizzie's joining us today.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.756
How lovely. Nice to see you, dear.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.216
-Do you knit?
-[Lizzie] No.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.053
-And I don't wanna learn.
-[Connie sighs]

10:37.136 --> 10:41.849
If you can assure me the rumor that
you and Ricky went to a motel is false,

10:41.932 --> 10:43.476
you are free to leave.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.353
I told you, I was at a friend's house.

10:45.436 --> 10:49.523
Now, Connie, if Lizzie says
she was with a friend, then I believe her.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.984
-Oh, I wish I could be so naive.
-Ugh.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.613
I'm going to the bathroom… alone.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.992
-[door opens]
-[Connie groans]

11:00.910 --> 11:01.827
What?

11:02.370 --> 11:06.290
I'm the only person
keeping her on the straight and narrow.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.875
[Lilly] Connie, honey,

11:07.958 --> 11:10.961
do you know what happens
when you hold on to a horse too tight?

11:11.045 --> 11:12.129
It bucks.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.050
-Doc! Hey.
-Oh!

11:16.133 --> 11:17.760
Well, hello, ladies.

11:17.843 --> 11:21.681
Hey, Lilly, thanks again
for driving your phone over last night.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.975
[sighs] I was just so glad
she was able to get hold of one of us.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.061
-Mm.
-She'd been trying all day.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.230
Sounds like the storm
made a mess of things.

11:29.313 --> 11:32.024
Indeed. In fact, she's gonna spend
another week or two there

11:32.108 --> 11:33.859
to help her aunt clean up.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.319
[both] Oh.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.863
Now I have to get the newsletter out
all by myself.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.242
No. We can help you with that.
Won't we, girls?

11:41.325 --> 11:42.368
-Yeah. Sure.
-Sure.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.704
We will take shifts at your house,

11:44.787 --> 11:47.289
and that way,
you don't have to cart everything around.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.000
Well, now, you're sure
I'm not asking too much of you?

11:50.084 --> 11:52.128
Oh, she's sure.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.798
[laughs awkwardly] Don't mind her.
That's what friends are for.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.259
Thank you. Thank you, ladies.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.064
Hey!

12:14.358 --> 12:17.528
-You haven't returned my texts.
-What are you doing back here?

12:17.611 --> 12:20.948
Connie dragged me to the sewing circle
'cause the bakery truck's being serviced.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.408
Cool.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.620
So, is your friend Parker still in town?

12:27.788 --> 12:31.834
Oh, I get it now.
That's what's bugging you.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.545
No. It's weird
that he dropped by without telling you.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.464
That's just Parker. He's spontaneous.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.425
-Mm-hmm. You guys are pretty tight?
-We went out for a while.

12:39.508 --> 12:40.509
Yeah, what's a while?

12:40.593 --> 12:42.720
I don't know. Like, three years?

12:42.803 --> 12:43.971
Seriously?

12:44.054 --> 12:46.348
Chill. We are just friends now.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.809
Does Parker know that?

12:50.603 --> 12:53.522
Anyway, do you wanna come over later?

12:54.190 --> 12:57.276
Connie has to pick up Christopher,
then helps Preacher with dinner,

12:57.359 --> 12:59.028
so she won't be home till late.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.322
Uh… I gotta study.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.115
You just graduated.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.285
Yeah, I need to research
which college classes to take, so…

13:07.328 --> 13:09.455
Whatever. If you don't wanna hang out…

13:09.538 --> 13:10.706
Okay, okay.

13:11.665 --> 13:15.461
How about I swing by
after my shift today, okay?

13:17.004 --> 13:21.008
How will I ever
begin to thank you? [giggles]

13:21.091 --> 13:22.551
-[kisses]
-[Lizzie giggles]

13:30.226 --> 13:31.352
[Preacher] I got this.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.854
-All right, Red Label.
-All right.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.607
And, uh, sorry I was late.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.735
It's just that
Christopher refused to go to camp.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.572
-I hope you won the battle, buddy.
-Yeah, I feel like I'm losing the war.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.825
-Yeah?
-I do not know how single parents do it.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.036
Please do not tell me that raising a kid
is harder than it looks.

13:49.119 --> 13:52.039
Oh, no, man. You, my friend,
are gonna be fine, all right?

13:52.122 --> 13:55.876
-Just, you know, my situation is unique.
-Come on, I got two of them on the way.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.462
-There's no way that's gonna be easier.
-Ah. [laughs]

13:58.546 --> 14:00.798
-[phone pings]
-Yeah, I can't argue with that.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.884
You wanna see if that's Christopher?

14:06.929 --> 14:07.930
[Jack] Nope.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.515
Jamie.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.226
Oh.

14:12.726 --> 14:13.894
So what happened there?

14:15.563 --> 14:16.772
She have a thing for you?

14:17.398 --> 14:19.650
No, man. Not like that.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.826
Hey, sorry, man.
I didn't mean anything by that.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.328
Well, actually,

14:32.288 --> 14:35.583
she recommended me
to a chef friend of hers in San Francisco.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.252
[chuckles softly] He offered me a job.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.921
I accepted.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.681
-You took another job?
-Yeah. Yeah, I did.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.894
But then Christopher came in the picture,
you got shot,

14:54.977 --> 14:56.729
so I bowed out.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.356
I didn't know you were unhappy, man.
I mean--

14:59.440 --> 15:04.153
Well, I wasn't, but after you turned down
the partnership offer,

15:04.945 --> 15:06.530
I decided to keep my options open.

15:06.614 --> 15:10.159
Oh, Preach, I… I had no idea
that being partners was so important.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.411
Hey, I'm the one who brought it up.

15:12.494 --> 15:15.831
Yeah, but I thought you were just trying
to help me out, you know?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.918
-[cell phone ringing]
-You know, don't worry about it, Jack.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.170
It's your bar. It's your business.

15:22.922 --> 15:23.964
Hello?

15:25.799 --> 15:26.759
Okay.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.261
Yeah, I will be there as soon as I can.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.513
[scoffs]

15:31.597 --> 15:33.807
That was Christopher's camp.
I gotta pick him up.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.225
Yeah, yeah, you go.

15:36.518 --> 15:39.438
We can talk about this later.
Don't worry about this afternoon.

15:39.521 --> 15:40.981
-We'll manage.
-Thanks.

15:43.984 --> 15:44.818
Yep.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.617
[Brady] Just give me the bottom line.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.411
Well,
pine beetles have infested half the lot.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.580
And the rest, it's just a matter of time.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.959
So, none of these trees are salvageable?

16:00.042 --> 16:00.918
Pretty much.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.630
Damn it.
There's gotta be something we can do.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.173
There's not a lot of options.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.344
Well, Calvin didn't pay
for proper lot inspections,

16:10.427 --> 16:11.971
and the company isn't insured.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.431
[scoffs] So I'm on the hook
for the whole thing?

16:14.515 --> 16:17.643
You could try and sell.
You'd have to disclose the infestation.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.728
I'm not selling the company. [sighs]

16:19.812 --> 16:23.190
I'll figure something out.
I just-- I need more time.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.192
Clock's tickin'.

16:26.777 --> 16:27.778
Thanks, man.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.197
[sarcastically] Super helpful.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.417
[Doc sighs]

16:42.418 --> 16:44.336
-[Doc gasps]
-What did you do?

16:44.420 --> 16:45.421
[Doc mutters]

16:45.504 --> 16:47.089
It's just a little paper cut.

16:47.172 --> 16:51.635
Oh, hold on.
I have a first aid kit in my purse.

16:51.719 --> 16:55.889
Oh, really, all I need is a tissue
so I don't bleed on Hope's table.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.893
Hm. And you know I've always said
that doctors make the worst patients.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.354
-Oh!
-Let's see.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.355
-Ow.
-Oh.

17:04.773 --> 17:09.236
You know, when I was in my twenties,
I dated an ER doctor.

17:10.195 --> 17:14.033
Do you know he actually finished his shift
with a broken arm?

17:14.533 --> 17:18.162
You know, when an ER is busy
and you don't have enough staff,

17:18.245 --> 17:19.830
you can't just walk away.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.583
Oh! I never thought of it that way.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.544
[laughing]

17:25.627 --> 17:27.880
Okay, here we go.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.883
-And that, sir, is good as new.
-Nicely done.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.301
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.428
-[knocking at door]
-There she is.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.013
-[Lilly] Hello?
-Hey.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.097
Oh, hey!

17:37.806 --> 17:40.726
Okay, what needs to get done?

17:40.809 --> 17:43.562
Well, plenty. Unfortunately,
I am due back at the clinic.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.231
Go ahead and go.
Muriel and I can handle the rest, right?

17:46.315 --> 17:47.816
Of course. We'll finish up here.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.070
Oh, thank you both so much
for all your help.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.404
Oh, it's nothing.

17:52.488 --> 17:56.867
Muriel, I'd still be trying to figure out
that printer if it wasn't for you.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.369
Aw. [chuckles]

18:04.333 --> 18:05.375
What?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.419
Nothing. [chuckles]

18:08.337 --> 18:09.421
Just here to work.

18:11.006 --> 18:11.840
Yeah.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.342
Me too.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.552
[hesitates]

18:18.931 --> 18:20.891
-Hey, I'm gonna take five.
-All right, yeah.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.192
If you're trying to butter me up,
it's working.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.194
-Oh, I know your weakness.
-[laughs]

18:34.029 --> 18:34.947
Mmm.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.867
-Wow, that's good. That tastes homemade.
-'Cause it is.

18:39.743 --> 18:40.702
[Brie] Mmm.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.540
So,

18:46.041 --> 18:47.709
how's the job search going?

18:48.293 --> 18:49.920
You want the truth?

18:50.003 --> 18:51.672
Uh, yeah. That'd be good.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.507
I'm not looking.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.093
Why not?

18:56.176 --> 18:58.637
I don't know
if I wanna go back to practicing law.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.766
You've wanted to be a lawyer
since you were a kid.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.561
Yeah. I didn't know what I signed up for.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.229
Which is?

19:07.729 --> 19:10.732
Working for a firm
that doesn't care what happens to you

19:10.816 --> 19:12.693
just as long as you win your cases

19:12.776 --> 19:15.821
and bill the clients
a crapload of money. [scoffs]

19:15.904 --> 19:16.864
Sorry.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.700
Wish I could help.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.327
You are helping me
by letting me stay here.

19:22.911 --> 19:26.248
-[Jack] Hm.
-The rest I have to figure out on my own.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.709
Ooh, spoken like a true Sheridan.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.378
-Independent to the bitter end.
-Oh yeah.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.255
[Brie laughs softly]

19:33.338 --> 19:34.506
Speaking of bitter,

19:35.257 --> 19:36.216
how's Charmaine?

19:36.300 --> 19:37.134
[Jack chuckles]

19:38.468 --> 19:40.053
[Jack inhales slowly]

19:41.305 --> 19:44.892
I get the feeling that her and Todd
are gonna limit my time with the twins.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.019
What makes you think that?

19:47.102 --> 19:48.812
She came by here after the fire.

19:50.230 --> 19:54.776
Said I didn't have to worry about housing.
That I could "visit" whenever I wanted.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.238
Oh, no, you cannot let that stand.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.365
Custody is all about precedent.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.784
Yeah, I know, I did some research.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.455
I'm thinking about hiring a lawyer.

20:06.538 --> 20:10.542
I know a great family practice attorney
over in Eureka. She owes me a favor.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.543
I'll call her.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.961
Thanks. Appreciate it.

20:14.922 --> 20:15.839
[Jack] Hm.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.509
By the way,
I am so happy you and Mel are dating.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.512
-Oh, are you now?
-You know she's way out of your league.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.890
-Hey!
-I'm just kidding. [chuckles]

20:24.973 --> 20:26.391
But don't mess that up.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.935
I'm trying not to.

20:28.018 --> 20:30.896
Uh, what do you mean, "trying"?

20:30.979 --> 20:34.399
Second night of living together,
I found her sleeping in her car.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.692
[Brie inhales sharply]

20:36.652 --> 20:40.781
I mean, I've heard you snore.
I don't blame her.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.991
Come on! It's not something I can control.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.452
We know how good you are
at things you can't control.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.037
So what am I supposed to do?

20:47.120 --> 20:48.830
Look, Mel loves you

20:48.914 --> 20:51.917
because you don't pretend
to be somebody that you're not.

20:52.584 --> 20:56.004
And out in the dating world,
that is pretty hard to find. Trust me.

20:56.088 --> 20:56.922
[Jack] Hm.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.341
Well, let's hope it's enough.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.717
[sighs]

21:00.801 --> 21:02.302
You're overthinking things.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.930
You need to get out of your own way.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.938
[Preacher inhales sharply]

21:13.021 --> 21:17.567
Christopher, buddy,
we can't keep doing this every day.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.444
I don't feel good.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.030
What you got? Stomachache?

21:22.114 --> 21:24.116
My chest hurts, and I'm cold.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.451
[coughs]

21:26.535 --> 21:27.452
Okay.

21:28.745 --> 21:32.958
Well, you know, if you're really sick,
we should have Doc check you out.

21:33.750 --> 21:34.584
Okay.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.045
So we're gonna drive to the clinic.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.338
Yeah.

21:38.422 --> 21:41.550
Just to be clear,
we're gonna drive to the clinic right now.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.470
Okay, then.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.688
Tara. I didn't expect to see you here.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.482
I don't have an appointment,
but Mel said I could wait here.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.192
Oh, of course, yes.

21:59.276 --> 22:02.446
You know, coincidentally,
I just saw your mother over at Hope's.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.866
That's actually what I came
to talk to you about.

22:07.034 --> 22:11.496
My mom hasn't been herself lately.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.414
Oh?

22:13.540 --> 22:14.374
How so?

22:14.875 --> 22:17.169
Well, she's sleeping,
like, 12 hours a day,

22:17.252 --> 22:19.296
and she's still tired all the time.

22:19.379 --> 22:22.632
Well, have her come in,
and I'll do a full workup.

22:22.716 --> 22:26.595
That's the thing. She refuses to see you
or any other doctor.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.679
Uh-huh.

22:28.263 --> 22:30.724
-And how are you feeling?
-Perfectly fine.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.102
I'm just worried about her.

22:36.021 --> 22:36.855
Okay.

22:37.439 --> 22:41.068
I will call your mom,
and I will convince her to come in.

22:41.151 --> 22:44.905
But she can't know
that I came to see you, okay?

22:44.988 --> 22:47.199
-You know how private she is.
-Yeah.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.952
Well, tell you what,
let me figure out what I can do,

22:51.036 --> 22:53.663
and then, meanwhile,
you keep an eye on her.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.581
I will.

22:55.248 --> 22:56.333
Thanks, Doc.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.250
You bet.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.670
-Bye, Mel.
-Bye.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.093
[sighs]
Thanks for covering for me earlier.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.220
Hope had a project
she needed me to finish.

23:08.804 --> 23:09.638
I heard.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.349
So, anything to report on your end?

23:12.432 --> 23:13.517
Uh, yeah.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.395
Uh, your two o'clock interview canceled.

23:18.105 --> 23:21.525
The message is still on the machine
if you wanna hear it for yourself.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.861
-Thanks for letting me know.
-Mm-hmm.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.279
[Mel] That's it? Really?

23:26.363 --> 23:29.074
You're not gonna explain what's happening?

23:30.784 --> 23:32.077
I wasn't planning on it.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.747
Okay, are you hiring someone new?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.582
[door opens]

23:37.666 --> 23:39.084
I am considering it.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.877
-[door closes]
-[Christopher wheezing]

23:41.837 --> 23:43.880
[Mel] Hey, guys. Hey.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.924
Are you having a hard time breathing?

23:46.007 --> 23:48.135
-[wheezes]
-It started right when we drove up.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.929
Before that, he said he was cold
and that his chest hurt.

23:51.012 --> 23:53.765
Christopher, why don't you and I
go into the exam room,

23:53.849 --> 23:55.600
and we're gonna figure this out, huh?

23:55.684 --> 23:56.643
[Christopher wheezes]

23:56.726 --> 23:59.896
Yeah, I don't know. I think
he may be trying to get out of camp.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.441
Uh-huh. It could be anxiety.

24:02.524 --> 24:03.775
-At his age?
-Hm.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.819
I… I know he misses Paige, but--

24:05.902 --> 24:07.904
Do you have any idea when she'll be back?

24:08.864 --> 24:09.948
No.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.159
Okay. Don't worry.
We're gonna figure it out.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.702
[Doc] Mel! I need you in here.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.707
[Doc] He's hypoxic.
Get me the BVM, please.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.418
-What's happening?
-[Doc] He's not getting enough oxygen.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.922
-[Mel] Has he been in water recently?
-Uh, yeah, the camp has a pool.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.635
[Doc] Christopher, I'm gonna
place this mask over your mouth, okay?

24:30.719 --> 24:33.388
Christopher, the mask
is gonna help you breathe, okay?

24:33.472 --> 24:36.183
I want you to take slow, deep breaths.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.559
Try to follow my count.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.686
One Mississippi.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.688
Two Mississippi.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.482
Three Mississippi.

24:43.565 --> 24:46.234
-You're doing great, buddy.
-[Mel] Four Mississippi.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.737
Now, Christopher,
you went to the pool today, right?

24:49.738 --> 24:51.490
Did some water go down the wrong way?

24:51.573 --> 24:54.618
[coughs, gasps]

24:55.327 --> 24:57.537
-Yeah, he's having a laryngospasm.
-Okay.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.122
-Larson maneuver?
-Yes.

25:00.707 --> 25:03.126
-[coughs]
-Hey, you're gonna be okay. I promise.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.211
What's going on?

25:04.294 --> 25:06.838
Stress on his lungs
is causing his vocal cords to spasm,

25:06.922 --> 25:07.881
blocking his airway.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.633
-[wheezing]
-[Doc] Here we go.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.012
-[gasps loudly]
-[Doc] A-ha.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.889
Good, good, good. It's working.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.893
[Mel] Here you go, buddy.

25:20.977 --> 25:21.978
[Mel] Very good.

25:23.438 --> 25:24.439
[quietly] All right.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.025
[Mel] You're gonna be okay.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.195
[mouths] He's okay.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.662
[keys rattle]

25:38.745 --> 25:39.913
[lock clicks]

25:41.748 --> 25:43.208
[lock clicks]

25:43.291 --> 25:46.002
Gonna check in with Deputy Howard.
Be right back.

25:46.086 --> 25:49.673
Hey, why don't you grab me a Coke
from the kitchen first?

25:51.508 --> 25:54.970
Otherwise, I might be too parched
to speak clearly. Know what I mean?

26:19.744 --> 26:20.745
[door opens]

26:27.377 --> 26:29.170
Well, hey there.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.256
Look who's out and walking around.

26:32.507 --> 26:33.883
Lucky. [sniffs]

26:35.510 --> 26:38.471
Guess that nurse of yours
has a pretty good set of hands on her.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.059
I'm just lucky you're such a lousy shot.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.354
If I'd pulled the trigger, you'd be dead.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.482
That's some big words coming from a guy
who's chained to a bench.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.567
[Jimmy scoffs]

26:57.907 --> 26:59.743
You know they can't hold me, right?

27:01.286 --> 27:04.956
If they had any evidence at all,
I'd be charged already, wouldn't I?

27:06.666 --> 27:09.294
-You been on a bender?
-Blowin' off some steam.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.046
[Jack] Why? Feeling anxious?

27:11.129 --> 27:14.007
Nuh. Just got a lot of time on my hands.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.638
What with being, uh, recently unemployed
and all that, you know?

27:20.263 --> 27:21.222
[Jack] Yeah.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.808
I'm sorry about that.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.728
I wouldn't worry about it.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.564
I'm sure you'll find a job in prison.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.194
Hey, G.I. Joe.

27:35.945 --> 27:39.491
You know Calvin knows you're responsible
for that raid, don't you?

27:39.574 --> 27:41.242
-Good.
-[Jimmy] Yeah.

27:41.868 --> 27:44.537
When Calvin finally takes you out,
then, uh,

27:45.872 --> 27:49.125
you know, I'll be more than happy
to take care of your girlfriend.

27:49.709 --> 27:50.752
Shut your mouth!

27:50.835 --> 27:52.587
-[shouting]
-[Mike] Hey! Jack!

27:52.671 --> 27:53.880
[shouting]

27:54.589 --> 27:55.590
Back off!

27:58.301 --> 28:00.387
-[Jack exhales]
-What the hell are you doing?

28:00.470 --> 28:03.139
-He threatened Mel!
-You're not supposed to be here.

28:03.223 --> 28:07.018
What, you want me to sit at home,
wait for the shooter to turn himself in?

28:07.102 --> 28:10.897
Okay. Look, right now,
Jimmy doesn't have an alibi,

28:10.980 --> 28:13.066
but there's nothing tying him
to the shooting.

28:13.149 --> 28:16.027
Please.
He's threatened to kill me multiple times.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.363
That's not enough for a conviction.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.532
He's been up to something. I can feel it.

28:20.615 --> 28:24.369
Hey, hey. We're cross-referencing
with neighboring law enforcement agencies.

28:24.953 --> 28:28.873
It takes time. A lot of these small towns
haven't digitized their systems yet.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.417
Okay, well, until then?

28:31.251 --> 28:32.919
[sighs] Go home.

28:33.837 --> 28:34.879
Try to calm down.

28:34.963 --> 28:35.797
[Jack scoffs]

28:36.381 --> 28:37.924
I will calm down

28:38.007 --> 28:41.219
when whoever tried to kill me
is behind bars.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.599
[door opens]

28:49.811 --> 28:50.687
[door closes]

28:51.980 --> 28:53.440
-[Muriel groans]
-[Lilly sighs]

28:53.523 --> 28:55.150
So, how many do we have?

28:55.233 --> 28:57.485
2,903.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.154
Okay, so that leaves…

28:59.237 --> 29:01.823
Oh, please, math is not my strong suit.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.825
That leaves 1,079.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.827
There you go. We're getting there.

29:05.910 --> 29:09.789
Unfortunately, I can't stay much longer.
I've gotta go feed Chloe her dinner.

29:09.873 --> 29:13.918
-By all means. Yeah, I can do the rest.
-That will take you all night long.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.379
Yeah, I don't mind. It's for a good cause.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.464
[Lilly] Hm.

29:21.718 --> 29:22.719
Um,

29:23.595 --> 29:27.390
I know we can't help who we love,
so I say this with total kindness.

29:27.474 --> 29:30.185
[inhales] I think
you're barking up the wrong tree.

29:31.019 --> 29:31.936
What do you mean?

29:32.020 --> 29:34.314
I've known Doc and Hope
for nearly 20 years.

29:35.648 --> 29:39.527
While they've had plenty of ups and downs,
they've never left each other's side.

29:40.236 --> 29:42.781
You think I'm trying to steal Doc away
from Hope?

29:42.864 --> 29:44.199
Well, from what I've heard,

29:44.282 --> 29:47.035
you've been doing an awful lot for him
since Hope went away.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.497
Listen, I know that everyone thinks
I'm on the hunt.

29:50.580 --> 29:53.666
"Oh, don't leave your husbands alone
with Muriel."

29:54.292 --> 29:55.960
But I'm not a home-wrecker.

29:56.711 --> 29:57.962
It wasn't that long ago

29:58.046 --> 30:00.298
that you made it clear
you had your eye on Doc.

30:00.381 --> 30:03.218
I didn't realize
how complicated their relationship is.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.344
I know.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.471
Doc is spoken for.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.391
Then why pay him so much attention?

30:11.726 --> 30:14.395
Truth is, I don't have
a lot of good friends here,

30:14.479 --> 30:15.814
and we have a lot in common.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.899
We both love classical music,

30:17.982 --> 30:21.236
and good wine, board games.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.490
I suppose I simply just enjoy his company.

30:26.616 --> 30:30.411
[Lilly] This isn't just about Hope, okay?
I want what's best for you too.

30:31.371 --> 30:34.749
As long as you realize that Doc
is completely devoted to Hope,

30:34.833 --> 30:37.043
you'll spare yourself
a whole lot of heartache.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.256
-Okay.
-[Lilly] Okay.

30:52.767 --> 30:57.313
[cell phone ringing]

30:58.857 --> 31:01.025
Hey. You on your way home?

31:01.526 --> 31:02.402
[inhales sharply]

31:02.485 --> 31:06.197
Ah, I'm stuck at work.
I might be a couple more hours.

31:06.281 --> 31:08.783
[Jack] Aw, you gotta be exhausted.

31:08.867 --> 31:09.951
Yeah, a little.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.161
You sure you don't want me
to stay at the B&B?

31:12.245 --> 31:15.206
Even if it's for one night?
I don't want you to get run down.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.960
What? I worked the graveyard shift
at the hospital for two years.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.753
This is nothing.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.589
-You're sure?
-Yes.

31:23.381 --> 31:26.301
Besides, I'm looking forward
to coming home and having you there.

31:27.927 --> 31:28.887
I love you.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.513
[Mel] I love you too. Bye.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.188
[Mel] Hey.

31:40.106 --> 31:41.399
-How you doing?
-Hey.

31:41.482 --> 31:47.071
Um, Doc's with him.
I, uh… I just needed a minute.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.615
-Yeah. Of course.
-Yeah.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.700
[door opens]

31:50.783 --> 31:53.036
[Doc] His breathing has stabilized.

31:53.119 --> 31:55.413
He nodded off.
I didn't have the heart to wake him.

31:55.496 --> 31:58.124
-Poor little guy.
-I don't understand what happened.

31:58.207 --> 32:01.127
[Mel] It appears he suffered
from respiratory dysfunction,

32:01.210 --> 32:04.631
connected to a small amount of water
that aspirated in his lungs.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.550
[Doc] He said he was swimming
with some bigger boys,

32:07.634 --> 32:09.802
and he got dunked a couple of times,

32:09.886 --> 32:13.473
and I think that was the source
of the delayed respiratory issue.

32:13.556 --> 32:14.933
[sighs deeply] He, uh,

32:16.225 --> 32:17.560
never told me that.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.313
You were smart and brought him in
before damage was done.

32:20.396 --> 32:21.606
I thought he was bluffing.

32:21.689 --> 32:24.567
Well, you know kids.
They're so hard to read.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.445
Well, maybe he should be
with someone else.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.865
-Someone better at this.
-[Mel] Christopher loves you.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.952
-He trusts you. That's what matters.
-[Doc] Mel's right.

32:34.035 --> 32:37.163
Don't beat yourself up.
You're doing a great job, Preach.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.501
Well, thanks. Both of you.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.463
I don't know what I would've done
if something happened to him.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.799
[Mel] I know. He's gonna be just fine.

32:47.882 --> 32:49.759
And he's gonna cue off of you,

32:49.842 --> 32:55.598
so when you go in there,
make sure he knows everything is okay.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.142
[breathes deeply]

33:00.937 --> 33:02.689
[Doc sighs]

33:06.275 --> 33:07.360
[Preacher sighs]

33:09.904 --> 33:11.072
[Doc sighs gently]

33:12.740 --> 33:17.036
Christopher's breathing is strong.
No sign of pulmonary edema.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.329
That's good. [sighs]

33:18.413 --> 33:21.958
But I would like to monitor him
for the next couple of hours.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.294
Okay. I can stay if you wanna go home.

33:25.378 --> 33:28.381
Oh, I appreciate that.
You want some coffee?

33:28.464 --> 33:29.382
No, thanks.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.467
[sighs]

33:31.551 --> 33:35.847
If you're thinking of hiring someone else,
don't you think I should be in the loop?

33:38.725 --> 33:40.727
I'm not adding anyone to the staff.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.480
Okay, what does that mean?

33:44.981 --> 33:48.609
Look, I don't have the energy
to get into it right now…

33:50.695 --> 33:54.032
[sighs] …but it's not your position
that I'm looking to fill.

34:08.004 --> 34:10.006
[rock music playing faintly]

34:14.552 --> 34:17.430
Hey. Didn't think you were coming.

34:17.513 --> 34:19.974
I had to help Jack with something.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.226
-I'll get the next one.
-Don't worry about it.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.728
I can buy my own drinks.

34:24.771 --> 34:29.484
You know, a guy can buy you a drink
without any strings attached.

34:29.567 --> 34:33.029
They can,
but my way, there's no confusion.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.614
Hm. All right.

34:35.656 --> 34:36.616
We'll do it your way.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.202
Wow. That was easy.

34:39.827 --> 34:42.914
I thought there'd be, you know,
at least a little bit of pushback.

34:42.997 --> 34:44.791
No. I don't sweat the small stuff.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.084
[laughs]

34:46.167 --> 34:48.836
Okay. What about the big stuff?

34:48.920 --> 34:53.174
Well, uh, let's just say
I won't start the fight,

34:54.258 --> 34:55.927
but I'm not afraid to finish it.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.514
I like it.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.517
Here's to not taking any crap.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.352
To not taking any crap.

35:04.435 --> 35:05.311
[bottles clink]

35:09.690 --> 35:10.691
[knock at door]

35:14.195 --> 35:16.239
Hey, I was, uh, I just gonna--

35:19.784 --> 35:23.329
Connie saw us together at the bar
and freaked out on me again.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.126
Are you going somewhere, dear?

35:28.209 --> 35:29.544
Actually,

35:31.129 --> 35:33.714
I was hoping
I could stay with you guys for a while.

35:35.675 --> 35:36.509
Oh.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.179
[door closes]

35:51.274 --> 35:52.108
Jack?

35:52.900 --> 35:53.776
I'm home.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.154
[latch clicks]

35:58.072 --> 35:59.407
-Hello there.
-[Mel chuckles]

36:00.032 --> 36:01.742
What you doing in there?

36:01.826 --> 36:03.870
Uh, just trying to figure something out.

36:04.620 --> 36:07.498
-[suspiciously] Okay.
-What flower do you prefer?

36:07.582 --> 36:08.791
Rose or jasmine?

36:10.001 --> 36:10.918
Uh,

36:11.002 --> 36:13.546
I guess I slightly prefer jasmine.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.715
That's not what I thought
you were gonna say.

36:15.798 --> 36:17.049
-Hold on one minute.
-Oh--

36:20.845 --> 36:24.682
Um, should I start dinner
while you're doing whatever you're doing?

36:24.765 --> 36:26.726
[Jack] No, no. I got it handled.

36:26.809 --> 36:29.061
Just one second.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.150
[Mel gasps] Oh!

36:34.859 --> 36:36.444
You drew me a bath.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.824
Well, you sounded
like you needed to relax.

36:41.908 --> 36:45.286
Oh, you are the sweetest,
most thoughtful man.

36:45.369 --> 36:48.289
Well, you are a remarkable woman.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.498
[Mel] Hm.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.460
[Mel] Mm.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.171
Are you gonna get in with me?

36:55.254 --> 36:57.757
Hm, no, I got a few details to attend to.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.758
-Details?
-Mm.

36:58.841 --> 37:02.345
The only thing you need
to focus on is you. Get in there.

37:02.929 --> 37:03.846
Okay, then.

37:09.268 --> 37:11.938
[cell phone ringing]

37:14.649 --> 37:15.733
Hey, what's the word?

37:16.275 --> 37:17.818
[Mike] We had to let Jimmy walk.

37:18.486 --> 37:19.737
Damn it. Why?

37:20.321 --> 37:23.783
-He got himself an alibi.
-[Jack] He probably paid somebody off.

37:24.450 --> 37:27.245
It's the Trinity County Sheriff,
so I doubt it.

37:27.995 --> 37:30.873
Jimmy was in their drunk tank

37:30.957 --> 37:32.792
You're just finding this out now?

37:32.875 --> 37:36.379
[Mike] Yeah. It's like I told you,
a lot of these small towns

37:36.462 --> 37:37.755
are still on paper systems.

37:37.838 --> 37:42.009
And in this case,
the Trinity clerk was out sick.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.970
And they're sure it was Jimmy?

37:44.053 --> 37:48.599
[Mike] Yeah. I'm sorry, man.
I… I thought we had our guy.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.017
Okay, what's next?

37:51.143 --> 37:52.812
We keep looking. [sighs]

37:53.896 --> 37:56.190
All right.
Hey, listen, man, I gotta bounce.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.525

[Hope] So Dr. Petersen
agrees with Dr. What's-His-Name?

38:06.784 --> 38:12.331
Dr. Wesley.
And, yes, they both say it is AMD.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.667
What's Petersen's plan for treating you?

38:14.750 --> 38:19.714
He said the best way to treat
wet age-related macular degeneration

38:19.797 --> 38:23.551
is something called anti-VEGF therapy.

38:23.634 --> 38:24.927
I've never heard of it.

38:25.011 --> 38:28.306
They inject a medication into my eyes
to shrink current vessels

38:28.389 --> 38:29.849
and prevent further growth.

38:29.932 --> 38:32.393
He says it is 90% effective.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.061
Are there any side effects?

38:34.145 --> 38:38.024
Infection, uh,
retinal detachment, stroke--

38:38.107 --> 38:40.776
Stroke? That's not a side effect,
that's a death sentence.

38:40.860 --> 38:41.944
Get a second opinion.

38:42.028 --> 38:44.739
Hope, Dr. Petersen is the second opinion.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.575
Then get a third!
There's gotta be a better treatment.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.785
Honey, it won't make a difference.

38:49.869 --> 38:52.496
I have AMD,

38:52.580 --> 38:55.374

waiting to go blind.

until we got this under control.

-I'm coming home.
-No, you're not gonna do any such thing.

There's nothing you can do here
you can't do from there.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.636
And there's only one thing I do want,

39:08.429 --> 39:12.892
and that is
to keep my diagnosis between us.
