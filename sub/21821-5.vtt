00:01.240 --> 00:03.240
[Toast] The new TS4.

00:03.320 --> 00:09.520
It's the car that literally goes vroom.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.880
That's great. Actually, Steven,
before you shoot off,

00:12.960 --> 00:15.160
there's a little thing
that's just come in. Do you mind?

00:15.240 --> 00:17.720
-What is it?
-Hi, Steven. This is Clem Fandango.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.200
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can hear you, Clem Fandango.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.840
We'd like you to do a charity thing
for the radio. Won't take long.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.720
-[groans]
-Script's in front of you, sir.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.280
Yeah, OK. I've got it. Are we rolling?

00:27.360 --> 00:28.920
Yep, ready when you are, Steven.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.080
Don't miss your opportunity
to experience Bon Ja-vee

00:33.160 --> 00:36.160
-live, up close and personal.
-[stifled laughter]

00:36.240 --> 00:38.720
You've got to understand,
I haven't got a clue what that means.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.360
I mean, I'm guessing it's the name of
some kind of pop group or dance craze?

00:42.440 --> 00:43.760
Spot on, Steven.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.400
Also the bit underneath, Steven,
when you're ready?

00:47.760 --> 00:53.840
Where else could you see Bon Ja-vee,
Madam Ga-ga and the Cold-play...

00:53.920 --> 00:56.480
-[stifled laughter]
-...under one roof!

00:57.400 --> 00:59.720
-That's perfect.
-[Clem] See you again soon, yeah?

00:59.800 --> 01:02.920
-I sincerely hope not.
-[sniggering]

01:29.880 --> 01:31.560
What the hell happened to Roy Highknock?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.920
[sighs] I'm afraid
I had to take his picture off the wall.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.800
-What, because of the...?
-Yes, because of the... Anyway.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.440
Pastures new.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.280
Ooh. Who's Sookie Houseboat?

01:41.360 --> 01:44.040
She's come over from Debbie.
I knew I'd get her in the end.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.960
Things weren't working out
for her there.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.160
I know how she feels.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.600
Sookie Houseboat.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.280
I could do with a slice of that.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.800
Haven't had so much as a sniff
since you know who cleared off.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.000
-I'd get stuck into that and no danger.
-Toast, please!

01:57.080 --> 02:01.520
Sorry, Jane. Must be the hot weather.
Plays havoc with my blood pressure.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.360
I've no interest in your carnal rumblings.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.800
My brother, Blair,
calls it the summer swell.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.479
I seem to be wearing a lot less
this season.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.080
You know, I had to loosen my belt
on the underground train--

02:12.160 --> 02:15.640
If you carry on, I will be sick.
No, I will be sick.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.000
[sighs]

02:20.080 --> 02:23.880
-So what's going on?
-Oooh, Doctor Who.

02:23.960 --> 02:28.440
You can fuck that sky high.
Not after last time. No way!

02:28.520 --> 02:31.520
[Doctor Who] Well, that's no way
to greet a fellow scientist.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.200
Would you like a jelly baby?

02:33.280 --> 02:37.160
We grow weary of
your adolescent diversions, Doctor.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.240
Take him to the laboratory.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.560
I'm sure a dissection on that brain
could prove very useful to us.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.360
[Toast] Yes.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.560
That could have been anyone in that mask.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.240
I felt like a top arsehole.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.600
Right, well, that... is it.

02:53.360 --> 02:57.960
I'm not too happy at the moment, Jane.
I feel like I'm in a bit of a rut here.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.920
Maybe I should
broaden my horizons a little.

03:00.680 --> 03:05.200
The thing is, Toast,
you don't actually have any horizons.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.120
[thinks]  That may be what you think,
Jane Plough,

03:08.200 --> 03:11.120
but there's a lot more to Steven Toast
than meets the eye.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.400
It's pronounced "Pluff" as you well know,
as in Brian Clough, the sportsman.

03:14.480 --> 03:18.120
That's odd. She seemed
to be able to read my thoughts, there.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.480
Now bugger off, Toast.
Some of us are working.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.840
-[sighs]
-Now.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.040
Ah, morning, Toast. You're up early.
Ah, who's that boy?

03:31.120 --> 03:33.080
Not one of yours.
You don't have children.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.160
Apparently, it's Brooklyn Beckham.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.680
Brooklyn Beckham?
What, Becks and Posh Spice's eldest?

03:38.760 --> 03:41.400
Yes. I downloaded the image accidentally
about a month ago

03:41.480 --> 03:43.080
and I can't get it off the screen.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.880
Ah, I can probably help you with that.
Let's see...

03:45.960 --> 03:47.920
-[Toast groans]
-That...

03:48.000 --> 03:50.200
Ed! [groans]

03:51.200 --> 03:53.680
-Followed by...
-Garlic!

03:53.760 --> 03:55.360
[Ed] And... there we are.

03:55.440 --> 03:59.760
Oh, what's that file?
Another Wife for Henry  by Paloma Toast.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.120
It's my new novel, Ed.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.760
Using a  nom de plume,  eh?

04:03.840 --> 04:07.320
I've been working on it for some weeks.
Just pissed off with all those voiceovers

04:07.400 --> 04:08.840
and appearing in that shit play.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.240
I'm even thinking about
getting a new agent.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.880
Do you know Brooke Hooberman?

04:12.960 --> 04:16.000
I've heard of her. David Bowie told me
he was thinking of signing up with her

04:16.079 --> 04:18.040
when he was doing
The Elephant Man  on Broadway.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.720
Then he just went back into the pop scene.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.960
Well, she's a hard-nosed
American female bastard.

04:23.040 --> 04:26.920
And that's exactly what I need and she's
in town and she's agreed to meet me.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.160
[Ed] So, this novel...

04:29.680 --> 04:31.480
-Sexy, is it?
-I'd say.

04:31.560 --> 04:35.280
It's a cross between Hilary Mantel's
Wolf Hall  and  Fifty Shades of Grey.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.480
I've read  Fifty Shades.  I must say it's
damn near my favorite book of all time.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.680
It's superb. And like that book,
my heroine is a strong-willed feminist

04:42.760 --> 04:44.560
who won't be dominated by anyone.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.040
-What's the story about?
-I can read you some if you like.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.720
Oh, yes, please.

04:48.800 --> 04:53.360
"Henry the Eight placed his toothbrush
beside Stephanie's.

04:53.440 --> 04:58.640
His, a dashing royal blue,
hers, a luminous pink.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.920
How harmonious they looked together

05:01.000 --> 05:06.560
in the silver goblet he had given her
for Valentine's Day 1541.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.320
'Oh, if only we could live together,'
he thought,

05:10.400 --> 05:12.600
remembering the time
they made love in the shed

05:12.680 --> 05:17.080
where the bows and arrows were stored
for the archery tournaments-s-s."

05:17.160 --> 05:20.640
-So, how does it end?
-Well, I was thinking...

05:20.720 --> 05:23.960
-[dramatic music]
-...that it may not need an end.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.800
Oh. I don't think
I've ever read a book without an end.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.360
I'm experimenting
with a new literary form.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.120
What are you gonna do with it?
Send it out to potential publishers?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.440
Already done.
And the fact that it doesn't have an end,

05:34.520 --> 05:38.360
I think will work in my favor.
I am very excited about this.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.760
Any replies from the publishers?

05:39.840 --> 05:43.120
None. But I'm hoping
Hooberman will give it a good push.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.480
Good for you, Toast.
Things are picking up at last.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.520
I think they are, Ed. And I'm
gonna tell her that I see myself...

05:48.600 --> 05:50.520
...very much at the peak of my career.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.000
I can honestly say,
I've never acted better in my life.

05:54.080 --> 05:58.200
There's always openings
in Hollywood for British actors.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.840
Butlers and chauffeurs
and that kind of shit.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.440
That's what I like to hear.

06:03.520 --> 06:07.480
[Brooke] Sorry about having to meet you
in a car.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.400
My office isn't quite ready yet.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.520
I'm also about to embark on
a complementary career as a novelist.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.680
I understand you have strong contacts
in the literary world.

06:18.760 --> 06:23.600
I do actually know a publisher
called Yvonne Wryly.

06:23.680 --> 06:28.520
Had a bit of a nervous breakdown
due to overwork, but she's back.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.440
If she likes a book,
she really gets behind it.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.640
Does this mean
you're taking me on as a client?

06:33.720 --> 06:36.440
[Brooke] Do you have representation
at the moment?

06:36.520 --> 06:39.200
I'm with someone
who is basically as old as the pyramids

06:39.280 --> 06:41.840
and as dynamic as a weather forecast.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.680
-[phone rings]
-Sorry. It's an old friend of mine

06:45.760 --> 06:48.760
Jane Plough. Do you know her?

06:49.640 --> 06:53.800
If I'm honest, it was bloody embarrassing,
but she said she wouldn't tell Jane.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.120
-Who is Jane again?
-Jane is my agent.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.640
-So you're some kind of actor?
-I'm not a kind of actor, I am an actor.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.560
Sorry, my name's Toast. Steven Toast.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.680
Hello, Toast, I'm Kate. Kate Khan.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.760
-Kate.
-Mmmm.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.360
Kate's in my top 20 of favorite
female names. Number 18, actually.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.040
[man sings tunelessly]

07:14.120 --> 07:15.640
-I love a singalong, don't you?
-Yes.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.720
-Why don't you have a go?
-No, I don't normally sing.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.400
Though there is one song
I'm told I perform particularly well.

07:22.480 --> 07:26.240
Sing it. Go on.
Get me a drink and then sing the song.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.520
-What will you have?
-Vodka and Coke.

07:28.600 --> 07:32.200
Ian, could you get the lady
a vodka and Coke, please?

07:32.520 --> 07:38.000
♪  You soooo... ♪

07:41.160 --> 07:44.160
[clears throat]
I'd like to dedicate this next song

07:44.240 --> 07:47.440
to a beautiful lady
in the audience called Kate.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.200
This is an old song about London.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.560

[sings electronic noises to the tune
of "Ghost Town" by The Specials]

08:29.000 --> 08:30.800
[scattered applause]

08:35.039 --> 08:38.159
-Hop it, old timer.
-Steven, this is my aunt, Deepa.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.720
Ah, nice to meet you.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.880
-Hope you don't mind if she sits there.
-No.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.240
I enjoyed that. It was unusual.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.360
Well, that's another string to my bow.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.360
What's the deal with your aunt?

08:52.440 --> 08:53.800
Oh, she likes these nights out.

08:53.880 --> 08:57.440
Unfortunately, she's deaf and blind,
also has a slight limp.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.880
My mother usually cares for her
but one month every year

08:59.960 --> 09:02.360
I come to London
and give Mum a bit of a break.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.320
So she's deaf, blind
and with a bit of a limp.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.480
Something of a fiasco, one might say.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.920
-Would you like to go to a club?
-A club?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.120
There's a club I go to round here.
Do you like dancing?

09:12.200 --> 09:14.240
-Of course.
-C'mon, lets have some fun.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.320
[disco music]

09:31.840 --> 09:36.960
[Kate] Oh yes! Yes, that's good.
Oh, like that! C'mon.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.960
-You don't mind me wearing my sports vest?
-No.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.480
What's wrong?

09:43.560 --> 09:45.320
Are you sure
she can't hear or see anything?

09:45.400 --> 09:47.000
[Kate] I told you, she's deaf and blind.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.400
It's a little odd though, isn't it?

09:49.480 --> 09:52.520
-Why? She doesn't know what's going on.
-Does she have to be in the bedroom?

09:52.600 --> 09:54.440
Yes, I can keep an eye on her here.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.720
And honestly,
she's completely oblivious to this.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.000
-Yes?
-Yes. Oh, yeah.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.400
Oh c'mon. Oh, you like that don't you?

10:01.480 --> 10:03.720
-Yes! Lucky you.
-Lucky me.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.400
-[Toast] Yeah.
-[Kate] Oh, give it to me. [laughs]

10:20.840 --> 10:23.200
-Come in!
-Steven Toast.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.880
[sighs] Wow.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.600
-What?
-What a book.

10:27.680 --> 10:28.840
Ah, thank you.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.600
It's seriously one of the best things
I have ever read.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.400
I think it's actually
much sexier than  Fifty Shades

10:35.480 --> 10:37.920
and just much better than
any of Mantel's books.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.160
I mean, I love Hilary,
she's one of my best friends, but,

10:41.240 --> 10:45.160
can she write strong female characters?
I don't think so.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.320
But you've created
this incredible, strong-willed,

10:49.400 --> 10:51.520
believable, independent woman.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.880
-She's amazing.
-You're not concerned she's a columnist

10:53.960 --> 10:56.000
-with a left-wing newspaper?
-Not in the slightest.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.800
OK, they probably didn't have newspapers
like  The Guardian  in the 16th century

10:59.880 --> 11:02.440
and they didn't have
columnists like Stephanie.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.080
-That's her name, isn't it?
-Yes. Stephanie De Swasson.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.920
But who cares? We just kind of go with it
because the character is so brilliant.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.400
She doesn't take any shit
from Henry the Eight.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.680
Totally in control of that situation,
and obviously,

11:14.760 --> 11:16.640
-the dominant sexual partner.
-Yeah.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.720
That was very important for me
when I was writing it.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.800
Well, we're so excited about this here.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.520
We just put this together.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.600
Where the hell did you find
that photograph of me?

11:26.680 --> 11:29.960
Oh, it's a collage portrait
put together by the art department.

11:30.040 --> 11:34.000
First I should say, it's not right.
We can do much better.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.000
-But the size is correct?
-No.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.560
But, listen,
this is the most important part.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.160
Major ads in all the trade papers.

11:43.240 --> 11:46.040
Heavy TV and cinema advertising.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.400
We are really going to sell this book,
because we believe in it so much.

11:49.480 --> 11:54.880
I can see this being quite seriously...
the biggest book of all time.

11:54.960 --> 11:59.520
And, I hate hyperbole, I hate all that
bullshit and I see it all the time,

11:59.600 --> 12:01.320
but this book really is that good.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.640
Well, I'm glad you like it
as much as I do.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.360
Publicity are planning
a massive celebratory lunch.

12:06.440 --> 12:09.200
There's a possibility
we can get Obama along to it.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.280
Oh, ho ho, top notch.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.880
Can I ask you, Steven,
do you have a wife or partner?

12:12.960 --> 12:15.880
Well, I'm having sex with an Indian lady,
which is great.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.240
But it is complicated
by the presence of a third party.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.920
Because we can organize getting
an A-list Hollywood actress along

12:22.000 --> 12:23.120
to accompany you on the day.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.640
Yes, I'd like that very much.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.640
I'll contact Brooke
about the sums involved here.

12:27.720 --> 12:31.000
Obviously we're talking millions, but I
don't want to discuss that with you now,

12:31.080 --> 12:33.480
because the book isn't quite finished.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.760
-Um...
-It needs an end.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.040
I was thinking
I could get away without having an end.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.680
No, no. Absolutely not.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.080
-Who told you that? Ben Elton?
-Who?

12:42.160 --> 12:45.640
Having an end is very important.
We need to know what happens to Stephanie.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.720
But don't worry.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.560
You could tie up the whole thing in a few
paragraphs. Maybe even a sentence or two.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.880
But it does need an end.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.680
Alright, I'll try and think of one.

12:55.920 --> 13:00.360
And, thank you, Steven, for writing
the greatest book of all time.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.280
Yes!

13:06.360 --> 13:08.120
"Henry the Eight felt hot that day

13:08.200 --> 13:10.280
and not just because
the sun was beaming down

13:10.360 --> 13:12.200
on the ramparts of Hampton Court Palace.

13:12.920 --> 13:16.320
Stephanie began to undress slowly
before her monarch.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.880
Henry responded by loosening
some of his heavy armor..."

13:19.960 --> 13:23.160
Oh, I like that, Toast.
That's got me going. Come on.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.800
Oh, yes. Mmmm.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.640
-[Kate] Oh, yes.
-[Toast groans]

13:30.720 --> 13:34.800
This is great sex.
Absolutely superb stuff.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.680
You're certainly
delivering the goods today.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.800
-That's 'cause I'm in a good mood.
-[camera beeps]

13:41.200 --> 13:43.880
Your aunt seems to be filming us
making love.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.520
Oh, come on, Toast,
she's just playing with her phone.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.440
I told you, she can't hear
or see anything.

13:48.520 --> 13:52.200
Well, if she's deaf and blind,
why does she need a camera phone?

13:52.280 --> 13:56.880
Oh, get real, Toast.
Every phone has a camera these days.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.440
Oh, that was lovely.

13:58.920 --> 14:03.000
Excuse me for a moment.
Need to go to the bathroom. [sighs]

14:05.640 --> 14:08.240
I wonder if you really can't see or hear.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.680
Hey!

14:12.720 --> 14:14.400
You there!

14:14.480 --> 14:15.520
Yeah...

14:17.800 --> 14:19.840
[hums loudly]

14:21.920 --> 14:23.880
[continues humming]

14:25.600 --> 14:27.200
[continues humming]

14:31.240 --> 14:32.280
[stops humming]

14:37.680 --> 14:42.280
Oh, bet you've not seen
anything like this for a while, have you?

14:43.000 --> 14:46.080
-[yelps]
-What are you doing to Aunt Deepa?

14:52.080 --> 14:54.080
Ah, still working on the novel, Toast?

14:54.160 --> 14:56.120
Must be nearly finished
if you don't need an end.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.600
Well, looks like
it may need an end after all.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.440
Publisher lady thinks it's crucial.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.960
What happens to Stephanie De Swasson?
It's a tough nut to crack.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.600
I'm sure it's easy enough to think
of an end. You could kill everyone.

15:07.680 --> 15:11.160
[sighs] I need to get out of here.
Clear my head.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.520
[Ed] Good thinking, Toast.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.040
I'm sure you'll definitely,
definitely be able to think of something.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.880
Definitely.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.000
How the shit am I going to end this book?

15:23.080 --> 15:26.800
How about "'This'll cure the toothache,'
uttered Stephanie De Swasson,

15:26.880 --> 15:30.120
as the executioner raised
an impressive axe. The end."

15:30.200 --> 15:31.280
That might work.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.080
"As the sun went down
over Hampton Court Palace,

15:34.160 --> 15:37.600
Henry watched the starship
containing Stephanie De Swasson

15:37.680 --> 15:39.880
zoom vertically up into outer space."

15:39.960 --> 15:41.400
Could be popular with the young set.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.680
"'What a perfect day,'
Stephanie thought to herself

15:43.760 --> 15:45.160
as she pulled up her wedding dress,

15:45.240 --> 15:48.600
undid her flies
and urinated into the urinal. The end."

15:48.680 --> 15:53.320
These are awful. Writer's block?
Writer's cock, more like.

15:53.880 --> 15:57.520
Hundred and eighty.
You're on form today, Deepa.

15:58.640 --> 16:02.120
Deepa? Deepa? Deepa?

16:02.520 --> 16:04.480
-[man] D'ya want another pint?
-Nah, I'm cool.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.600
-[Toast] Oi!
-[Deepa] Oh, fuck!

16:09.400 --> 16:10.680
You'd better go, Dave.

16:10.760 --> 16:14.560
I bloody knew it!
All this not hearing and seeing stuff.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.120
-Total bullshit, am I right?
-Look, I was deaf and blind.

16:18.200 --> 16:23.040
But last year I went to the holy temple
in India and received a miracle cure.

16:23.120 --> 16:26.120
I didn't tell anyone, 'cause I didn't want
to lose me benefits.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.640
So you're a benefits cheat?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.560
You know, it's because of people like you,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.840
that the membership
of the UK Independence Party

16:31.920 --> 16:33.400
has gone up twelvefold.

16:33.480 --> 16:38.560
-Don't tell everyone!
-Oh, I will, I will! In fact... Officer?

16:38.640 --> 16:41.360
Stop that woman.
She's a benefits cheat.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.760
Well, go on!

Would everybody in the library
please leave the building?

This is a routine fire drill.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.840
-I've got it, Ed.
-What?

18:18.920 --> 18:21.320
An end. I've got the end to my novel.

-I see. Oh, well done.
-It's truly inspired.

Well, come on then, do tell.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.880
What happens to the fair and feisty
Stephanie De Swasson?

18:29.960 --> 18:32.000
Spontaneous combustion.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.320
-Spontaneous combustion?
-Yes.

18:34.400 --> 18:38.240
Stephanie De Swasson
spontaneously combusts?

18:38.320 --> 18:42.960
You must be fucking joking!
It's a ridiculous cop-out.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.040
Is the end of  Moby Dick
the whale spontaneously combusting?

18:46.120 --> 18:49.240
-Did J K Rowling have Harry Potter...
-Who?

18:49.320 --> 18:54.280
...bursting into flames to tie up her
series of seven hugely successful novels?

18:54.360 --> 18:57.000
People can spontaneously combust.
It's on the internet.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.880
-No, they can't!
-Yes, they can.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.680
Though rare, there have been
exactly 200 documented cases.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.800
It's totally unbelievable.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.440
To think, I offered you
the sun, moon and stars

19:07.520 --> 19:10.280
and this is the best ending
you can think of.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.360
I had a nervous breakdown

19:12.440 --> 19:16.160
and I come back to work after six months
and have to deal with this shit!

19:16.240 --> 19:20.520
And I'll tell you something else,
you little prick, if I ever--

19:22.520 --> 19:24.360
[sighs]

19:25.680 --> 19:29.880
Well, that's not going to help my book.
[sighs]

19:31.840 --> 19:34.720
She was just saying
how completely unbelievable it would be

19:34.800 --> 19:39.400
for someone to spontaneously combust
and then, bang!

19:39.480 --> 19:41.640
I mean, it was the definition of irony.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.960
Irony writ very large.

19:44.040 --> 19:47.040
Yes, I guess we'll never know
what causes spontaneous combustion.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.480
It's one of the great mysteries,
like the moon landings.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.920
-[phone rings]
-Excuse me.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.320
Toast. Ah, well that is promising.
All the best.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.440
-Who was that, Toast?
-Brooke Hooberman.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.360
Apparently, a Hollywood film producer
called Dinky Frinkbuster wants to meet.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.560
Hollywood producer, eh?
Oh, that's impressive.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.280
Must be staying somewhere
like Claridge's or The Dorchester.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.880
I expect so.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.080
-[sirens wail]
-[dog barks]

20:14.160 --> 20:17.560
[Dinky] Make yourself comfortable, Toast.

20:17.640 --> 20:20.400
-Want a banana?
-No, I'm good.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.720
So, what's this movie about, Frinkbuster?

20:22.800 --> 20:25.160
Well, it's about a couple
of lesbian lovers, right?

20:25.240 --> 20:26.840
They get kind of bored of the lesbian sex,

20:26.920 --> 20:29.000
so one goes out with this
big black bodybuilder.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.360
The other one stays at home
lying in the sun,

20:31.440 --> 20:34.880
until... a hunky British guy
comes by to clean out the pool.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.120
OK, so I need to get the overall picture.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.240
What would you say
the theme of the film is?

20:39.320 --> 20:42.240
-What do you mean, theme?
-So, I'm playing the British pool cleaner?

20:42.320 --> 20:44.560
-Yeah.
-So what's my relationship with the girl?

20:45.960 --> 20:48.600
W... Well, you just fuck her.

20:48.680 --> 20:52.480
[laughs]
That sounds like it could be a porn film.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.680
-Look, I've seen your work.
-What?

20:54.760 --> 20:57.480
Hope we're not at cross purposes here?

20:57.560 --> 21:01.600
This is great sex.
Absolutely superb stuff.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.800
[Kate]  You're delivering
the goods today, Toast.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.480
[Toast]  That's 'cause
I'm in a good mood.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.760
Haven't you seen that?

21:06.840 --> 21:09.120
-That's outrageous!
-Got half a million hits.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.200
That Indian lady with the sunglasses
is not a professional film maker.

21:13.280 --> 21:16.080
-She's a benefits fraudster.
-Well, suit yourself.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.840
Hold your horses, don't turn it off.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.480
-[Kate]  Oh, God, that's nice.
-Yes!

21:24.600 --> 21:26.080
-How many hits?
-Half a mill.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.960
-Is that good?
-You're a superstar.

21:30.120 --> 21:33.760

-You are lucky!

-She sure is.
-[laughs]

21:39.480 --> 21:42.200
Toast, you fucking snake!

21:42.920 --> 21:46.200
Going behind my back
with all that Secret Squirrel stuff.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.640
Sit up straight when I'm talking to you.

21:49.720 --> 21:50.840
I asked her not to tell you.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.520
Brooke and I are very old friends.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.400
Course she's going to tell me if
one of my clients is trying to jump ship,

21:55.480 --> 21:56.640
you fucking idiot!

21:57.200 --> 21:59.040
-Well, nothing materialized--
-Shh!

21:59.120 --> 22:01.520
You do have some ridiculous ideas,
don't you?

22:01.600 --> 22:03.840
Hollywood films, novel writing.

22:03.920 --> 22:07.520
I'm this close to taking your picture
off my wall.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.720
Oh, come on, Jane.

22:10.800 --> 22:14.960
I shall think about this tonight and let
you know my decision in the morning.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.400
Be needed in the studio at ten o'clock.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.480
[Toast] Bzzzz.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.880

22:33.080 --> 22:35.040

22:37.320 --> 22:40.760

Look, I'm gonna need some direction.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.760
