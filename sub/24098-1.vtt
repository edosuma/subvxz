00:58.980 --> 01:03.483
<i>According to legend, Himiko,
the first queen of Japan,</i>

01:03.485 --> 01:05.286

through dark magic,</i>

01:08.824 --> 01:10.958
<i>spreading death
and destruction</i>

01:10.960 --> 01:13.859
<i>by the mere touch of her hand.</i>

<i>She was only stopped
by a single twist of fate.</i>

01:17.266 --> 01:21.635

Why would I do
a thing like that?

'Cause you can't afford
your own.

05:51.373 --> 05:53.207
Yeah. No fun
if they ain't quick.

19:00.862 --> 19:02.695

This is a list
of all our assets.

01:47:43.812 --> 01:47:45.678
Thank you.

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.847
No, I think you'd better stay

01:47:47.849 --> 01:47:49.650
on top of
the day-to-day things, Ana.

01:47:49.652 --> 01:47:52.052
Well, as you wish.

01:47:52.054 --> 01:47:54.054
Boardrooms and business deals.

01:47:54.056 --> 01:47:56.556
I'm just not
that kind of Croft.

01:47:56.558 --> 01:47:58.195
(CHUCKLES)

01:48:03.764 --> 01:48:07.370
Neither was Dad,
as it turns out.

01:48:22.085 --> 01:48:24.953
Are all these companies
owned by us?

01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:26.355
Yes.

01:49:07.562 --> 01:49:09.796
RICHARD: <i>I know them
by name now...</i>

01:49:09.798 --> 01:49:12.035
<i>The Order of Trinity.</i>

01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:15.802
<i>An ancient
militant organization</i>

01:49:15.804 --> 01:49:18.306
<i>that seeks control
over the supernatural</i>

01:49:18.308 --> 01:49:21.178
<i>in order to rule
the fate of mankind.</i>

01:49:24.647 --> 01:49:27.815
LARA: <i>What kind of work
do you do?</i>

01:49:27.817 --> 01:49:32.219
VOGEL: <i>Oh, a mix of things.
At the mercy of my employer.</i>

01:49:32.221 --> 01:49:34.992
LARA: <i>Are all these companies
owned by us?</i>

01:49:37.292 --> 01:49:39.394
VOGEL: <i>You're not
savin' anyone.</i>

01:49:40.028 --> 01:49:43.164
<i>Trinity is everywhere.</i>

01:49:43.166 --> 01:49:45.199
ANA: <i>I know it's difficult
to accept.</i>

01:49:45.201 --> 01:49:48.238
But you really must come in
and sign those papers now.

01:49:49.171 --> 01:49:51.137
LARA: <i>I think
you'd better stay</i>

01:49:51.139 --> 01:49:52.708
<i>on top of
the day-to-day things, Ana.</i>

01:49:53.041 --> 01:49:54.909
ANA: <i>As you wish.</i>

01:49:54.911 --> 01:49:57.012
VOGEL: <i>The only person
that I get to talk to</i>

01:49:57.014 --> 01:49:59.416
<i>is on the other end
of this phone.</i>

01:50:01.917 --> 01:50:03.252
(GASPS)

01:50:09.392 --> 01:50:11.325
RICHARD: <i>You must understand.</i>

01:50:11.327 --> 01:50:14.164
<i>We Crofts,
we have responsibilities.</i>

01:50:16.631 --> 01:50:18.100
Jobs to do.

01:50:27.977 --> 01:50:30.478
Oh. You again.

01:50:33.116 --> 01:50:35.048
I came back for the amulet.

01:50:35.050 --> 01:50:37.384
Shame. I was hoping
you'd forgotten.

01:50:37.386 --> 01:50:39.186
It's worth a bloody fortune.

01:50:39.188 --> 01:50:41.488
I did tell you
it was your lucky day.

01:50:41.490 --> 01:50:42.822
Yes, you did.

01:50:42.824 --> 01:50:44.658
(WOMAN CLEARS THROAT)

01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:47.364
- At it again, are we, Alan?
- ALAN: I'm not at it.

01:50:54.237 --> 01:50:56.435
ALAN: I don't know
if you've noticed or not,

01:50:56.437 --> 01:50:58.271
but, uh, you can't be
too careful these days

01:50:58.273 --> 01:51:00.408
because the world
has gone bloody mad.

01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:02.874
Yes, yes, thank you, Alan.

01:51:02.876 --> 01:51:07.280
What you got there is
a HK USP 9 mil. extended mag.

01:51:07.282 --> 01:51:09.218
It's my personal favorite.

01:51:12.154 --> 01:51:13.954
You like that?

01:51:13.956 --> 01:51:15.056
I do.

01:51:15.058 --> 01:51:16.259
Mmm.

01:51:18.161 --> 01:51:19.729
I'll take two.
