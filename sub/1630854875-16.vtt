Step on inside, folks!

00:09.467 --> 00:11.344
We've got chicken karaage.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.263
We've got chicken katsu curry,

00:13.304 --> 00:15.932
and for those kiddies,
we've got the chicken tendies.

00:15.974 --> 00:19.185
Don't worry, we won't tell
if you order some for yourself.

Magnum: [ Through earpiece ]
I gotta say, Higgy,

00:20.854 --> 00:22.731
you seemed pretty mad
when you lost that roshambo.

00:22.772 --> 00:25.692
But you are really
owning that chicken suit.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.194
[ Normal voice ]
Well, the manager was nice
enough to let me post up here,

00:28.236 --> 00:29.988
so the least I can do
is send him some business.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.198
Well, you are quite
the sales-chicken, aren't you?

[ Chuckles ]

00:33.533 --> 00:35.035
Let's just hope our skip
actually shows up.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.829
Oh, he's gonna show up. He needs
money to get off the island,

00:37.871 --> 00:40.623
and my source says that this is
his go-to pawn shop.

Oh, hi, sir. Here you are,
some two-for-one coupons.

Magnum: Wait, did that --

00:49.591 --> 00:52.427
That guy just totally
checked you out.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.387
Guess he's into chicks.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.056
Please don't.
Little does he know,

00:56.097 --> 00:57.057
you're not single.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.099
Yolks on him.

Oh, sorry.
I'm on a crash diet.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.304
You know, I've got
the Marine Corps Ball tonight

02:59.346 --> 03:01.139
and still got a few
extra pounds to shed

03:01.181 --> 03:02.849
before I can fit
into those blues.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.351
So the dreaded "baby weight"
got to you, huh?

03:04.392 --> 03:05.852
Happens to the best of us.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.229
Excuse me, no, no. I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.522
It's not the baby weight.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.358
Suzy took the uniform
to a new dry cleaner.

03:11.399 --> 03:14.569
I'm sure the dry cleaner
shrunk the uniform.

You're right,
it is the baby weight.

H-How -- How is that bacon,
by the way? You enjoying it?

Almost as much as
I'm enjoying your pain.

Mm.
Mm.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.916
I see you went with
the Loco Moco special.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.460
It's amazing.
You wanna bite?

03:30.502 --> 03:33.004
No, I'm good.
I went to Koko Head cafe.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.757
Had to try that new
"Elvis' Revenge" sandwich.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.051
Oh, nice.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.469
Kale and cucumber smoothie?

03:39.511 --> 03:42.764
That would be a hard pass.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.724
Well, I'm guessing
you'll have no trouble

03:44.766 --> 03:46.476
fitting into
your blues tonight.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.395
Well, I'm eating
whatever I want

03:48.436 --> 03:51.064
because I'm-a pass
on the ball this year.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.482
What? Why?

03:52.524 --> 03:55.360
Well, Mahina was my plus one,
and we broke up,

03:55.402 --> 03:56.695
so I don't wanna go.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.406
Come on, man.
The ball is a tradition.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.907
I mean, i-it's the one night
in the year

04:00.949 --> 04:02.659
where we get to meet up
with old buddies

04:02.701 --> 04:05.495
that we served with, reminisce,
and get so blackout drunk

04:05.537 --> 04:07.956
that we don't remember
any of it.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.041
I'm sorry,
I'm-a sit this one out.

Magnum: Yeah, I'm walking out
now. How'd it go with the skip?

04:18.633 --> 04:20.927
I just turned him over
and collected our bounty.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.137
What's your diagnosis?

04:22.178 --> 04:23.722
Ah, they gave me a sling.

04:23.763 --> 04:27.183
Just, you know, nothing a little
Tylenol and ice can't handle.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.351
I'll see you
back at the house.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.103
Okay, I'll see you soon.

Hey, uh, excuse me.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.419
You need some help?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.421
Jacob:
Hannah is my sister.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.799
About six months ago,
she turned 17 and decided

04:59.841 --> 05:02.510
to come to Hawaii
for her Rumspringa.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.012
It's a rite of passage
for the Amish.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.597
Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.475
Teenagers leave the community
and live in secular society.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.435
Experience things
they otherwise wouldn't.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.813
Yes, except we call it
the "English" world.

05:13.855 --> 05:17.192
Hannah had always wanted
to see Hawaii.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.028
She traveled all the way
from our home in Pennsylvania.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.322
And for a while, it seemed
like everything was going well.

05:22.364 --> 05:26.493
She wrote letters home saying
how amazing the experience was.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.662
How she never knew
how big the world was

05:29.704 --> 05:32.332
until she stood
with her feet in the water,

05:32.374 --> 05:35.502
looking out
at the endless ocean.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.337
So what happened?

05:37.379 --> 05:38.505
I don't know.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.465
But something changed.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.342
The letters stopped coming
so regularly.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.968
She sounded different.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.178
Then about two weeks ago,

05:45.220 --> 05:47.681
my family received
a final letter from Hannah

05:47.722 --> 05:51.851
informing us that she would not
be returning to the community.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.354
Look, I don't mean
to sound insensitive,

05:54.396 --> 05:57.232
but, uh,
is that so uncommon?

05:57.273 --> 06:01.361
I'm -- I'm assuming some people
decide not to come back.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.488
Of course,
but that's not my sister.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.823
She wouldn't just
leave me like that.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.367
So you think she's
in some kind of trouble?

06:07.409 --> 06:08.785
Yes, that's why I'm here.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.787
I told my parents I'd be working
on my uncle's farm

06:10.829 --> 06:12.664
for a few days
and flew in to find her.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.040
I bought a phone.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.001
A lady at a print shop
helped me make some flyers.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.253
That's what I've been doing
for the past few days.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.213
Okay, so your parents,

06:20.255 --> 06:22.048
they don't even know
you're here?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.216
I know.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.844
And I-I know it was wrong
to lie to them,

06:25.885 --> 06:27.554
but I know I'd never be able
to live with myself

06:27.595 --> 06:31.891
if I didn't at least
try to find Hannah.

06:39.941 --> 06:40.775
Higgins:
I don't know about this.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.111
I mean, of course
I want to help the boy,

06:43.153 --> 06:44.988
but this is complicated.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.657
Complicated because he's Amish,
or because he's young?

06:47.699 --> 06:49.701
Well, both, but the whole point
of Rumspringa

06:49.743 --> 06:52.287
is to allow the Amish youth
to make an informed decision

06:52.328 --> 06:54.414
as to whether they want
to join the Amish life.

06:54.456 --> 06:57.625
And it appears that Hannah has
chosen to leave her community.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.127
Who are we to meddle?

06:59.169 --> 07:00.962
Yeah, yeah, it appears
as though she chose, but he --

07:01.004 --> 07:03.798
he doesn't believe that she
would abandon him like this.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.967
But if we find her
and she doesn't want to go back,

07:06.009 --> 07:07.469
we're gonna have to
tell him some news

07:07.510 --> 07:10.847
he doesn't want to hear.
Yes, obviously.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.683
So, Jacob, I know I told you
I'd take the case,

07:13.725 --> 07:15.769
but, uh, here's the deal --

07:15.810 --> 07:17.645
I'm gonna have to let
your parents know where you are

07:17.687 --> 07:19.189
and that you're safe.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.523
Yeah.
Okay.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.108
But that won't be easy.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.153
The closest phone is several
miles away from my home.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.446
It's at the store in town.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.114
Okay, well then, you're gonna
have to tell me

07:28.156 --> 07:31.743
the name of the store
and your parents' full names.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.662
It's the general store
in Paradise, Pennsylvania.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.290
And my parents are
John and Sara Fischer.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.709
Although, I'm sure
they'll be pretty upset

07:39.751 --> 07:41.169
when you talk to them.
Well, actually,

07:41.211 --> 07:42.754
we're not gonna talk to them.
Our friend Kumu

07:42.796 --> 07:44.923
is gonna handle that.
With a case like this,

07:44.964 --> 07:47.842
a potential missing person,
every second counts.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.803
Why don't we start with you
telling us everything you know

07:49.844 --> 07:53.515
about Hannah's life in Hawaii?

07:53.556 --> 07:54.891
I know
when she first got here,

07:54.933 --> 07:57.018
she stayed in something
called a hostel.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.978
She got a job
scooping ice cream

07:59.020 --> 08:01.981
and eventually found a room
for rent in an apartment.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.693
She said she went
to a few Sunday services

08:04.734 --> 08:06.277
at the Mennonite church.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.906
I-I went to a bunch of different
ice cream shops, and...

08:09.948 --> 08:11.700
no one seemed to recognize
her picture.

08:11.741 --> 08:12.909
And there was
no return address

08:12.951 --> 08:14.577
on any of the letters
she sent, so...

08:14.619 --> 08:16.955
With a missing persons, uh,
the first thing you got to do

08:16.996 --> 08:18.748
is understand
their frame of mind.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.001
Hannah's a 17-year-old
Amish girl

08:21.042 --> 08:22.794
on her own
for the first time.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.629
I mean, you were that age
when you were

08:24.671 --> 08:25.839
in boarding school, right?
Yeah.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.215
What kind of trouble
did you get into

08:27.257 --> 08:28.967
when you got your
first taste of freedom?

08:29.009 --> 08:31.136
Yeah, I suspect
you'd be disappointed.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.347
But anyway, times have
changed since then.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.224
That they have.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.600
What are you doing?

08:37.642 --> 08:39.352
Well, I don't know
a teenager around

08:39.394 --> 08:42.063
who doesn't spend half
their time on social media,

08:42.105 --> 08:43.690
and I doubt that would be
any different

08:43.732 --> 08:45.817
for an Amish girl
with her first phone, right?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.902
Yeah.
What's social media?

08:47.944 --> 08:50.613
Oh, it's a form of communication
that's supposed to allow us

08:50.655 --> 08:53.783
to be closer to each other but
actually isolates us further.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.410
And here we are.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.203
Okay.

08:57.245 --> 09:03.960
**

09:04.002 --> 09:10.550
**

09:10.592 --> 09:12.093
She looks so happy there.
I...

09:12.135 --> 09:14.512
Well, the last photo she
uploaded was three weeks ago.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.514
After that, she just stopped.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.766
And I don't see
any indication

09:17.807 --> 09:19.059
of where she's staying at.
Right?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.935
Actually, I'm not sure
that that's true.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.645
Seems she recently adopted
a puppy,

09:22.687 --> 09:26.191
and she's tagged the shelter --
Found My Home Dog Rescue.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.610
And places like that
will make you provide

09:28.651 --> 09:30.528
an address
on the application.

You must be
Hannah's brother.

a lot about you.

Is my sister here?

09:46.461 --> 09:47.629
Um, sorry.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.631
I figured she would
have told you.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.133
Hannah moved out
a few weeks ago.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.844
Okay. Do you have any idea
where we can find her?

09:54.886 --> 09:56.262
Um, unfortunately, no.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.391
The number I have for her
was disconnected.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.809
At first, I was hesitant

10:00.850 --> 10:02.769
about taking on a roommate
who was super religious,

10:02.811 --> 10:05.480
but she could not
have been sweeter.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.191
We became friends right away,
hung out all the time,

10:08.233 --> 10:11.611
and then, eventually,
we adopted Ginger here together.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.029

to experience,

10:14.948 --> 10:18.410

Taylor Swift.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.578
Everything was new to her.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.331
But then, something changed.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.499
What happened?

10:24.541 --> 10:27.460
She lost her job.
She kept paying rent,

10:27.502 --> 10:30.380
but I had no idea
where the money was coming from.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.341
And honestly, she seemed
kind of depressed.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.342
Do you know why?

10:34.384 --> 10:35.969
I asked,
but she wouldn't say.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.263
And then she started
keeping these weird hours.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.182
Coming home late. I was willing
to put up with it until

10:41.224 --> 10:43.977
she started bringing around
these new friends she had made.

to find them?

11:04.539 --> 11:07.292
No. I just assumed she had
met them at a bar or a club.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.616
Did I say I was getting --

18:36.658 --> 18:39.369
I meant I'm headed out
to get some waves.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.121
Speaking of
"headed out" --

18:41.162 --> 18:43.373
tonight is
the Marine Corps Ball.

18:43.415 --> 18:44.708
I'm not sure if
you're aware of it.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.419
And I happen to know a vet
who needs a date.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.629
Now, he's a great guy.
It's a little complicated.

18:49.671 --> 18:52.340
He was recently shot.
He had to re-learn to walk,

18:52.382 --> 18:54.384
and his girlfriend
broke up with him.

18:54.426 --> 18:56.720
But, you know, it would mean
the world to me

18:56.761 --> 18:58.596
if you would consider
maybe, just maybe,

18:58.638 --> 19:01.975
possibly being his date
to the ball tonight.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.686
Sorry. How do we
know each other again?

19:04.728 --> 19:05.812
La Mariana.

19:05.854 --> 19:06.938
Oh. The bar.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.732
Yes! Rick.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.900
Rick!
I served you a drink --

19:10.942 --> 19:13.028
a rye and ginger,
I believe it was.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.320
It was a brief interaction,

19:14.362 --> 19:17.323
but I really thought
we had a connection there.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.910
Well, usually when some rando
pulls something like this,

19:20.952 --> 19:23.830
I'm tempted to report them
to the cops for stalking.

19:23.872 --> 19:27.292
But it seems like you're doing
something nice for a friend.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.960
So, what time's this ball?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.462
7:30, Ala Moana Hotel.

19:30.503 --> 19:34.382
Does this mean
you will go?

19:34.424 --> 19:35.759
Sure.
It could be fun.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.927
And I'm always down
to help out a vet.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.263
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.848
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you!

19:41.890 --> 19:44.976
No problem. Hey, I thought
you were going for a surf.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.394
Oh, um, you know --

19:46.436 --> 19:48.772
I'm kidding.
I'll see you tonight.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.190
Alright.
See you tonight.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.358
Thanks.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.485
Malia Manuel, everybody!

19:54.819 --> 19:56.863
How are you enjoying
your lunch?

19:56.905 --> 19:58.823
**

19:58.865 --> 20:02.869
I didn't think anything
could top shave ice, but...

20:02.911 --> 20:05.121
this might be the best food
I've ever tasted.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.414
Aww.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.749
Oh, I heard back
from the owner

20:07.791 --> 20:10.126
of the general store
in your hometown.

20:10.168 --> 20:13.588
He's gonna get word
to your parents to call us.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.091
Thanks.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.260
I know our ways must seem weird
to someone like you.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.970
Actually, a lot
of Amish values

20:21.012 --> 20:23.390
are very similar
to Hawaiian culture.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.934
Like how you focus
on family and community.

20:25.975 --> 20:29.062
But you don't shut yourself
off from the rest of the world.

20:29.104 --> 20:34.025
Modern Hawaii is really a mix
of different ethnicities,

20:34.067 --> 20:35.694
cultures, religions.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.862
Much like that plate lunch
you're eating --

20:37.904 --> 20:41.616
the Japanese-style rice,
American mac salad,

20:41.658 --> 20:44.577
Chinese noodles,
and Korean spare ribs.

20:44.619 --> 20:47.956
Hawaiians see diversity
as a strength.

20:47.997 --> 20:51.167
But we're also humble enough
to recognize

20:51.209 --> 20:53.503
that we're not
the only way.

20:53.545 --> 20:56.423
That's nice.
But it doesn't seem fair

20:56.464 --> 20:58.425
that I get to experience
your culture

20:58.466 --> 20:59.843
and you'll never
get to see mine.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.470
Actually, I-I think
I'm getting to see

21:02.512 --> 21:04.931
a glimpse of it
right now.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.768
[ Buzzer ]

21:11.813 --> 21:13.481
Nora. Hi.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.442
**

21:15.483 --> 21:17.527
My name is Juliet Higgins.

21:17.569 --> 21:20.697
I'm a private investigator,
and I'm here hoping

21:20.739 --> 21:24.034
that you might be able
to help me.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.286
With what?

21:26.327 --> 21:28.997
This is Hannah Fischer.
She's 17,

21:29.039 --> 21:30.623
and I believe
that she's wrapped up

21:30.665 --> 21:33.710
with the same crew
that put you in here.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.378
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.005
Nora, I completely
understand

21:37.047 --> 21:39.007
why you didn't cooperate
with the police.

21:39.049 --> 21:41.634
You're more scared of the men
who put you up to that robbery

21:41.676 --> 21:43.762
than you are of this place.

21:43.803 --> 21:47.766
I get it. But I'm not
working with the police.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.267
Okay?
My partner and I were hired

21:49.309 --> 21:52.771
by Hannah's younger brother
to try to help find her.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.732
I just can't do it
without your help.

21:55.774 --> 21:58.651
And it isn't
just about Hannah.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.737
We have to stop the men
that put you in here,

22:00.779 --> 22:03.365
or they will continue
to victimize women

22:03.406 --> 22:05.450
like you and her.

22:05.492 --> 22:12.290
**

22:12.332 --> 22:14.417
Okay.

22:14.459 --> 22:17.629
Um, I came out here
from Baltimore.

22:18.713 --> 22:22.092
My home life wasn't
exactly awesome.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.094
So, the day I turned 18,

22:24.135 --> 22:26.846
I dropped out of school
and booked a plane ticket.

22:26.888 --> 22:29.641
I was alone.
I didn't know anyone.

22:29.683 --> 22:32.977
I tried to find work,
but the little money that I made

22:33.019 --> 22:35.063
ran out fast.

22:35.105 --> 22:38.274
One day, I met a guy who said
I could make some quick cash.

22:38.316 --> 22:41.444
It started off with dummy
credit card purchases.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.279
Next thing I knew...

22:43.321 --> 22:46.866
**

22:46.908 --> 22:49.494
...I was helping them
hustle tourists

22:49.536 --> 22:52.789
and commit robberies.

22:52.831 --> 22:57.293
I was so crazy, and --
and I wanted out, but I...

22:57.335 --> 23:01.548
They made it clear
that that wasn't an option.

23:01.589 --> 23:02.966
They took my phone away.

23:03.008 --> 23:05.301
They told me that if I ever
tried to run away

23:05.343 --> 23:06.803
or go to the cops,

23:06.845 --> 23:09.681
they -- they would find me,
and they would kill me.

23:09.723 --> 23:12.600
When I finally got arrested,
it was a relief

23:12.642 --> 23:15.228
because...

23:15.270 --> 23:16.938
at least they couldn't
get to me in here.

23:16.980 --> 23:19.983
But, Nora, you shouldn't
even be in here.

23:20.025 --> 23:22.027
Look, we can talk to
the prosecuting attorney.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.570
We can explain
your situation.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.071
No. No, I can't. No.

23:25.113 --> 23:28.742
Nora.

23:28.783 --> 23:31.036
I know that this is
very scary.

23:31.077 --> 23:34.247
But we have to stop the men
that put you in here.

23:34.289 --> 23:35.582
You know that.

23:35.623 --> 23:39.919
We cannot do it
without your help.

23:39.961 --> 23:41.171
Okay?

23:41.212 --> 23:43.965
I just need you
to give me a name.

23:44.007 --> 23:52.349
**

23:52.390 --> 23:55.352
The man in charge

23:55.393 --> 23:57.604
is named Ben.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.898
Ben Satele.

23:59.939 --> 24:08.073
**

24:08.114 --> 24:09.991
Man: HPD!

24:10.033 --> 24:12.702
**

24:12.744 --> 24:15.246
-We're clear!
-Clear!

24:15.288 --> 24:17.040
Clear!

24:17.082 --> 24:19.459
**

24:19.501 --> 24:21.419
Something's wrong.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.588
Yeah. It's too quiet.

24:23.630 --> 24:32.222
**

24:32.263 --> 24:40.647
**

24:40.689 --> 24:41.773
Where's Hannah?

24:41.815 --> 24:43.400
No sign of her.

24:43.441 --> 24:47.153
**

24:51.408 --> 25:00.792
**

25:00.834 --> 25:02.460
The place was tossed.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.254
Whoever did this
was looking for something.

25:04.295 --> 25:06.715
Yeah. And for a heist crew, the
place is awfully light on cash.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.550
Yeah, unless they got smart
and hid it somewhere else.

25:08.591 --> 25:11.136
Well, maybe that's why Hannah's
missing. Maybe they took her,

25:11.177 --> 25:12.804
hoping that she could
lead them to the money.

25:12.846 --> 25:15.223
I'll get an APB out.

25:15.265 --> 25:18.101
Good chance whoever did this was
probably robbed by this crew.

25:18.143 --> 25:19.602
Which means
our next move should be

25:19.644 --> 25:21.604
to look into
their recent victims.

25:21.646 --> 25:27.694
**

25:27.736 --> 25:33.825
**

25:33.867 --> 25:36.578
We need to talk.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.747
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't
have been looking at it.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.165
No, not that.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.292
I finally spoke
to your parents.

25:42.334 --> 25:45.462
You didn't just lie to them.
You lied to us.

25:45.503 --> 25:46.796
I'm sorry.

25:46.838 --> 25:49.591
And your name's not Jacob,
it's Saul.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.217
And you're 14 years old.

25:51.259 --> 25:54.346
And you stole your cousin's I.D.
so you could get tickets

25:54.387 --> 25:55.972
without getting
your parents' permission.

25:56.014 --> 25:57.682
They're worried sick
about you!

25:57.724 --> 25:59.434
Sure.
For me, they're worried.

25:59.476 --> 26:00.685
But when it comes to Hannah,

26:00.727 --> 26:02.020
they don't care
what happens to her.

26:02.062 --> 26:04.022
That's not true.
Yes, it is!

26:04.064 --> 26:05.523
That's why
I came by myself.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.859
Because they wouldn't.

26:07.901 --> 26:10.195
Thomas and Juliet have
only shown you kindness.

26:10.236 --> 26:14.074
The least you could have done
was be honest with them.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.409
If I had told them the truth,
they wouldn't have helped me.

26:16.451 --> 26:18.661
They would have sent me home.
Just like you're going to do.

26:18.703 --> 26:20.163
No one's saying that.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.791
But what you did is wrong.

26:24.292 --> 26:26.169
Saul.

26:26.211 --> 26:27.545
Saul!

26:27.587 --> 26:32.384
**

26:32.425 --> 26:34.344
It was definitely wrong of him
to lie to us.

26:34.386 --> 26:36.888
But I kind of understand
why he did it.

26:36.930 --> 26:40.225
Yeah, I have to agree.
Jacob -- or rather, Saul --

26:40.266 --> 26:42.435
thought he was never
gonna see his sister again.

26:42.477 --> 26:43.770
I mean, he didn't want

26:43.812 --> 26:45.647
to take the chance
that we wouldn't help him.

26:45.689 --> 26:47.399
Yeah. I'd just give him
a little time to cool off,

26:47.440 --> 26:49.192
then just
check in on him later.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.403
I suppose I could have been
a little more understanding.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.780
But I felt
we made a connection.

26:53.822 --> 26:57.575
So, when I found out he was
lying, it -- it set me off.

26:57.617 --> 26:58.743
How's it going on your end?

26:58.785 --> 27:00.286
Any closer to finding Hannah?

27:00.328 --> 27:03.248
Actually, she's in more trouble
than we could have imagined.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.959
But there's no sense
in letting Saul know that.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.711
In the meantime, we're gonna
talk to somebody

27:07.752 --> 27:09.295
who may know
where she's at.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.548
We'll keep you posted
if we find anything.

27:11.589 --> 27:13.675
Good luck.
Bye.

27:13.717 --> 27:17.053
**

27:20.724 --> 27:23.935
I understand you two
are private investigators.

27:23.977 --> 27:26.271
How can I help you?
Your private equity group

27:26.312 --> 27:29.482
recently bankrolled
a local marijuana dispensary,

27:29.524 --> 27:32.861
and we're investigating
a robbery that took place there.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.904
As we understand it,
the thieves made off

27:34.946 --> 27:36.531
with a quarter
of a million dollars in cash.

27:36.573 --> 27:39.284
That's true. Legal weed
is a booming industry.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.494
But because it isn't legal
on the federal level,

27:41.536 --> 27:44.122
banks won't touch it.
And robberies like that,

27:44.164 --> 27:47.876
unfortunately,
are the cost of doing business.

27:47.917 --> 27:50.128
But that's why we carry
insurance, right?

27:50.170 --> 27:53.214
Right. Except that
we pulled up your policy.

27:53.256 --> 27:55.425
And it only covers losses
up to $10,000.

27:55.467 --> 27:59.512
So, in fact, you took
quite a significant hit.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.431
Huh.

28:01.473 --> 28:06.311
I say this fully aware
of how it sounds,

28:06.353 --> 28:07.854
but do you think
I'm the kind of guy

28:07.896 --> 28:10.732
who loses sleep over
a quarter-million-dollar loss?

28:10.774 --> 28:14.444
The type of business I run,
that's an insignificant sum.

28:14.486 --> 28:15.528
A rounding error.

28:15.570 --> 28:16.988
Except you didn't
get to where you are

28:17.030 --> 28:19.157
by letting people
walk all over you. Right?

28:19.199 --> 28:21.242
Somebody robs you,
you got to send a message

28:21.284 --> 28:22.911
that it won't be tolerated.

28:22.952 --> 28:25.997
Like, say, for example,
tracking down the thieves,

28:26.039 --> 28:29.209
shooting them dead
in their homes.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.836
This is the part
where I tell you to get out.

28:31.878 --> 28:35.090
Look, Mr. Bedrosian. As far as
the triple homicide goes,

28:35.131 --> 28:36.633
the police can handle it.

28:36.675 --> 28:38.551
We have no interest
as to what your involvement

28:38.593 --> 28:40.136
may or may not have been.

28:40.178 --> 28:42.389
And even if we did, I can
only assume you're smart enough

28:42.430 --> 28:45.850
to ensure that nothing
could be traced back to you.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.687
But the girl
that your men kidnapped

28:48.728 --> 28:50.689
did not choose
to be part of that robbery.

Spoke to Gordie.

39:37.585 --> 39:42.257
Looks like the PA's not gonna
pursue charges against Hannah.

39:42.298 --> 39:43.842
And Nora Diaz's sentence

39:43.883 --> 39:46.594
is gonna get knocked down
to time served.

39:46.636 --> 39:48.221
That is great.

39:55.270 --> 39:56.604
Can I ask you something?

Of course.

Uh...

40:10.160 --> 40:12.203

40:12.245 --> 40:15.874
I guess the short answer
is yes.

40:15.915 --> 40:18.918
I'm not gonna pretend to know
exactly what that means.

40:20.170 --> 40:22.422
What about you?

40:22.464 --> 40:24.299
Not really, no.

40:24.341 --> 40:25.842
The rational part
of my brain

40:25.884 --> 40:29.137
just pokes too many holes
in the concept.

40:29.179 --> 40:32.432
But then I look
at all of this...

makes you wonder.

Oh, the one on top?
Yeah.

40:58.708 --> 41:00.460
That's the Bronze Star.

41:00.502 --> 41:03.296
Don't you have to do something
really heroic to get that?

41:03.338 --> 41:06.299
Yeah. But that's a story
for another night.

41:06.341 --> 41:07.550
Okay.

Maybe you should think

41:11.846 --> 41:13.306
about pacing yourself.

Oh! I realize
it's hard to keep up.

In Rick's defense,

But I guess I owe the guy
a big thank you.

'Cause if it wasn't for him,
you wouldn't even be here.

41:39.082 --> 41:42.210
True.
But to be honest,

41:42.252 --> 41:45.338
it didn't take
much convincing.
