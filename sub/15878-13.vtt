WEBVTT

00:03.803 --> 00:07.295
Kerry, look. Six of the Seven Tips
to the Perfect Kiss I already do.

00:07.374 --> 00:10.537
The seventh I don't need
because my lips are naturally moist.

00:11.044 --> 00:14.070
Yeah, like you can learn how to kiss
by reading a magazine.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.876
It beats getting mirror-burn.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.280
Shut up.

00:19.285 --> 00:22.413
Thanks for letting me stay here
till my Mom could pick me up.

00:22.489 --> 00:23.956
- Sure.
- Bye, Rory.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.992
Yeah. Bye, punk.

00:27.293 --> 00:30.922
All right, Sabrina. Thanks for showing
me that spin move. See you soon.

00:30.997 --> 00:32.464
- Say hi to your mom.
- Bye.

00:32.531 --> 00:33.692
Bye-bye.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.464
Oh, boy.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.833
He's pinching his nose.

00:37.904 --> 00:40.236
- He's mad at somebody.
- Hope it's you.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.796
Rory Joseph Hennessy.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.844
- The whole name!
- Oh, he's gonna get it!

00:44.911 --> 00:46.742
What? What did I do?

00:46.813 --> 00:50.681
What didn't you do? You were insulting
Sabrina the entire car ride home.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.048
And you just called her "punk."
Why?

00:53.119 --> 00:55.485
She doesn't like "butt-face."

00:56.956 --> 00:58.184
You're making my point.

00:58.258 --> 01:01.091
I was gonna say something,
I didn't wanna embarrass you

01:01.161 --> 01:03.322
- in front of your friend.
- Favorite child.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.489
Yeah, when does that matter?

01:05.565 --> 01:09.023
Tomorrow, you're gonna apologize
to Sabrina. And just so you know,

01:09.102 --> 01:13.436
punching somebody in the arm every time
you see a VW bug is not OK.

01:13.506 --> 01:15.531
And it still hurts.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.243
What? What?!

01:20.313 --> 01:24.010
[both teasing] Rory's got a girlfriend.
Rory's got a girlfriend.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.109
- [girls continue chanting]
- [grunts]

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.771 --> 01:47.740
Hey, girls.
Get over here. You got mail.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.642
Paper mail.

01:54.514 --> 01:57.074
I can show you how to open it.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.947
Looks like the results
for your state aptitude tests.

02:00.019 --> 02:02.783
They don't prove anything.
What is aptitude, anyway?

02:02.889 --> 02:05.756
A talent, skill, or ability
for learning.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.292
Got that question wrong.

02:07.360 --> 02:12.229
I'm with Bridget on this one. I don't
place much stock in standardized tests.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.665
- That's 'cause you didn't do well...
- I had pink eye.

02:17.003 --> 02:19.267
OK, whatever, I don't really care.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.308
- [gasps] An 88. I got an 88!
- You did?!

02:22.408 --> 02:24.239
I read to her as a child.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.377
Just so you guys know,
I really did my best, OK?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.539
We know that.
You can always take it again.

02:29.616 --> 02:32.278
- [gasps] I got a 92!
- I'll pay for tutors, classes...

02:32.352 --> 02:34.718
You said you got a 92?!

02:34.821 --> 02:36.379
I did better than Kerry!

02:36.489 --> 02:39.151
No, wait, let me see that, no. No.

02:39.225 --> 02:40.692
[whining] No!

02:42.028 --> 02:45.088
Don't worry. It's just a little
higher than your cute score.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.134
- Wait, wait, wait! Calm.
- Bridget, this is outstanding.

02:48.234 --> 02:51.465
I can't remember the last time
you made the refrigerator door.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.200
[mock laughing] I can.

02:55.275 --> 02:58.108
It was in the second grade.
She drew a six-legged dog.

02:58.178 --> 03:02.512
No, this is bigger than the
refrigerator. I gotta frame this.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.812
These.

03:04.884 --> 03:07.352
I should start wearing glasses
and put my hair up

03:07.420 --> 03:09.285
because now I'm smart and hot.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.987
Wake up. Wake up.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.291
[knocking]

03:17.397 --> 03:19.627
- Guys?
- Wow, it knocked.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.735
- I have a question.
- We don't care.

03:23.603 --> 03:26.128
Let's just say a guy likes a girl.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.639
A girl named Sabrina?

03:28.274 --> 03:30.435
No! This is for a friend of mine.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.704
- Let's just call him...
- Dork?

03:34.581 --> 03:38.142
OK... And he...

03:38.218 --> 03:40.686
- He lives down the hall from us?
- [Rory] Know what?

03:40.753 --> 03:42.186
You know, what? Forget it!

03:42.255 --> 03:45.190
- Come back. We'll help you.
- Sit down. Oh, and shut the dork.

03:47.093 --> 03:48.560
I'm just joking. Last one.

03:50.029 --> 03:53.362
OK, so you like Sabrina
and you wanna ask her out.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.560
Yeah, and I can't talk to Dad about it

03:55.635 --> 03:59.332
because as soon as he finds out
I like a girl, he's gonna go, "Aw!"

04:00.773 --> 04:02.297
- Aw.
- Aw.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.240
Well, how do you know
Sabrina even likes you?

04:06.312 --> 04:10.214
Patrick stole this note from Megan who
got it from Lacey, passing it to Katy.

04:10.283 --> 04:14.219
It said Sabrina called me a "hottie with
a body", which is good, so it's a lock.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.817
Oh, my God. You've turned into Bridget.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.557
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

04:22.629 --> 04:24.290
OK, so what's the problem?

04:24.364 --> 04:27.492
Well... a bunch of people are going
to the movies this weekend,

04:27.567 --> 04:29.797
and I was thinking
about asking Sabrina.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.564
[both laugh]

04:31.638 --> 04:35.096
- What? You don't think she likes me?
- Well... no.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.971
OK, let's just say, by some freak
chance, she's not using you

04:39.045 --> 04:42.537
to make a cooler guy jealous
or win a bet by dating Ã¼ber-dork.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.947
Um, Dad's never gonna let you go.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.246
But it's with a group.

04:46.319 --> 04:48.810
Dad didn't let me group date
when I was your age.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.448
Oh, but in fairness,
you had to be part of a group.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.095
- I had friends.
- They were one-foot-tall and stuffed.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.722
- Shut up!
- And you kissed them.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.061
Shut up! [scoffs]

05:01.134 --> 05:03.295
Just do what I do, all right?
Just sneak out.

05:03.403 --> 05:06.668
Don't do that. You'll get caught
and you'll be in worse trouble.

05:06.739 --> 05:09.503
Come on. Who ya gonna listen to?
Her or the smart one?

05:10.510 --> 05:13.138
Oh, please. You were bound
to do well eventually.

05:13.212 --> 05:15.874
If you give a thousand monkeys
a thousand tests...

05:15.948 --> 05:18.109
That would be one test per monkey.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.082
A 92... I...

05:38.071 --> 05:40.562
- [sighs]
- Yes?

05:42.008 --> 05:44.670
- Dad... I have a question.
- No monkey.

05:46.679 --> 05:50.843
No. It's just that there's... this girl.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.185
- Aw!
- Forget it.

05:53.252 --> 05:56.813
No, no, no, wait, wait... wait!
I'm sorry. Sit down. Sit down.

05:56.889 --> 06:00.552
Rory, I promise I won't do that again.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.856
So who's the lucky girl?

06:03.763 --> 06:05.993
Actually, it's Sabrina Jenkins.

06:06.065 --> 06:07.623
- Aw!
- Dad.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.361
Sorry! That's awesome.

06:09.435 --> 06:13.599
Kerry! Check it out. Rory's about to
ask Dad if he can go out with Sabrina.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.971
This is gonna be a train wreck.
Move, I can't see.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.978
Anyway, a bunch of people
are going to the movies Saturday.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.071
And I was wondering
if I could go with them.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.912
Half-truth. Interesting move.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.820
- And take Sabrina.
- Honesty? Such a rookie mistake.

06:28.888 --> 06:32.016
Now it'll be a "no" and
a three-hour lecture of why it's a "no."

06:32.091 --> 06:33.183
- Show's over.
- Yeah.

06:33.259 --> 06:36.023
- Sure you can go. Sounds like fun.
- Really? Sweet!

06:36.095 --> 06:37.255
- What?
- What? Dad!

06:37.330 --> 06:40.299
- My God, you are such a hypocrite.
- You're favoring Rory!

06:40.400 --> 06:42.368
- It's not fair!
- Kerry stole my shirt!

06:44.737 --> 06:46.261
I thought I'd slip that in.

06:47.974 --> 06:51.808
OK, Rory gets to date.
Bridget's smarter. Wake up! Wake up!

06:53.112 --> 06:56.206
OK, everybody be quiet!
Kerry, pull yourself together.

06:56.282 --> 06:57.840
Paul, what's going on here?

06:57.950 --> 07:01.477
Well... Rory got himself
a little girlfriend.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.714
Aw!

07:07.560 --> 07:10.620
- Mom, Dad's letting Rory date.
- Oh, yeah.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.861
Which is totally unfair.

07:13.966 --> 07:16.491
The sisters are wiggin'.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.871
Well, it isn't exactly a date.
It's a group thing.

07:21.974 --> 07:24.238
Just a group thang.

07:24.310 --> 07:25.971
OK, Rory! Beat it.

07:26.045 --> 07:28.912
- Rory is skidattlin'.
- Go!

07:29.916 --> 07:32.976
OK, calling it a "group thing"
instead of a date is just...

07:33.052 --> 07:34.212
- Just...
- Semantics?

07:34.320 --> 07:35.753
- I was gonna...
- Say that?

07:35.822 --> 07:39.189
- Know what? It is go time, genius!
- Bring it over here. Let's go.

07:39.258 --> 07:41.021
- You couldn't...
- Girls! Girls!

07:41.127 --> 07:43.254
I thought you were on
the same side here.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.490
Sorry. This ain't over.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.566
"Isn't."

07:47.667 --> 07:49.532
Look, you gotta talk to Dad for us.

07:49.602 --> 07:52.969
Yeah, he's letting Rory get away
with murder because he's the boy.

07:53.039 --> 07:55.405
Meanwhile, the women
are stuck in the kitchen.

07:55.508 --> 07:59.274
Yeah, but only one of us
is actually doing anything.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.278
You know we're right.
Talk to him.

08:01.347 --> 08:03.815
Well, girls, I'd love to help you out
on this one.

08:03.883 --> 08:07.319
But your dad and I have an agreement.
We do not undercut each other.

08:07.386 --> 08:10.253
- OK, but what about sisterhood?
- Well, I'm all for it,

08:10.323 --> 08:12.450
but this sister needs a new car.

08:12.525 --> 08:14.550
So I'm picking my battles.
Good luck!

08:15.895 --> 08:18.659
- Mom, come on!
- Wait! Get ready. Here he comes.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.201
Hello, girls. How's it going?

08:22.301 --> 08:25.668
OK, first of all, we are not girls.
We are women.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.934
It's been a long day.
Could you be women after dinner?

08:30.243 --> 08:33.474
No. You're bending the rules for Rory.
We're not gonna take it.

08:33.546 --> 08:36.481
- It's a double standard.
- Want me to tell him he can't go?

08:36.549 --> 08:38.914
We don't care if he goes.
We want more freedom.

08:38.985 --> 08:41.953
And pro-rated. For all the times
we didn't get to do stuff.

08:42.054 --> 08:45.023
- Yeah, so we want later curfews.
- And dates on weeknights.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.285
- And a tattoo that says "Kyle."
- Bridget!

08:48.327 --> 08:50.295
Sorry. I thought I'd slip that in.

08:50.396 --> 08:53.957
I see. So you both think
I treat Rory better than you?

08:54.066 --> 08:55.590
- Yes.
- Yeah.

08:55.668 --> 08:59.035
I see. I don't agree, but fair's fair.
So how about this?

08:59.138 --> 09:01.663
Your curfew's
always been 11:00, right?

09:01.741 --> 09:03.572
No, it's actually been 11:30.

09:03.643 --> 09:06.134
- Really?!
- Yeah. For like about a year.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.181
Oh! Well, then never mind.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.548
Hey, Dad. Check it out.

09:18.624 --> 09:22.321
I got the new Insane Clown Posse CD
for the ride to the movies.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.886
You know, set the mood.

09:25.731 --> 09:30.168
[chuckles] The name alone
screams "romance."

09:30.236 --> 09:31.965
[doorbell rings]

09:32.972 --> 09:35.736
Little Hennessy, what do you say?

09:35.841 --> 09:37.706
You gonna invite me in?

09:37.777 --> 09:41.543
I can't. My mom hates you
and doesn't want you in our house.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.616
That so? Well, guess what,
her car's not here... move it.

09:44.684 --> 09:47.517
- Tommy? What brings you here?
- My wife call?

09:47.587 --> 09:48.952
No. Why would your wife?

09:49.055 --> 09:50.420
- She...
- [phone rings]

09:50.523 --> 09:52.855
- Hello.
- Give me...

09:55.861 --> 09:58.227
Yeah, I'll get that report to Higgins.
Hello?

09:58.331 --> 10:01.664
Honey, what are you? I told you
I'd be working here, didn't I?

10:01.734 --> 10:04.999
Well... Wait a minute.
Are you checking up on me?

10:05.071 --> 10:08.598
I don't check up on you, do I?
Because I trust you.

10:08.674 --> 10:12.405
Well, frankly, if I were in your shoes,
I'd feel terrible too.

10:13.579 --> 10:15.410
All right, well, don't cry.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.918
All right.
Just don't call again, all right?

10:20.019 --> 10:22.180
OK. Yeah, me too. Bye.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.257
- See ya.
- Tommy, I hate it when you do this.

10:27.026 --> 10:29.551
I hate myself when I do this.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.393
- Why do we do this, Hennessy?
- I'm not doing anything.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.332
That's exactly what I tell myself,
but I get over it.

10:36.035 --> 10:39.004
What are you doing Saturday?
I may need you by your phone.

10:39.071 --> 10:43.030
I'm sticking around here on Saturday.
My son's going out on his first date.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.666
Rudy has his first date.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.575
- Rory.
- Whatever. Your little boy!

10:46.646 --> 10:48.910
Yeah. Already.
Then again, he is a Hennessy.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.814
Ah... More important,
he overcame it.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.184
[chuckling]

11:03.462 --> 11:07.228
You're chuckling a lot for a guy
reading the history of the Cosa Nostra.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.893
I was just thinking about Rory.
Lo and behold,

11:10.002 --> 11:12.095
he's got his first date with a girl.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.905
[continues chuckling]

11:18.010 --> 11:21.070
- I'm reading.
- No, it's just, I'm thinking about...

11:21.147 --> 11:25.641
...how it was almost like yesterday
when he said, "Girls are yucky,"

11:25.718 --> 11:29.051
and throwing rocks at 'em
and now, lo and behold,

11:29.121 --> 11:31.783
he's got his first date
with a little girl.

11:31.857 --> 11:35.020
You can't pretend
that you're not thinking about it, too.

11:35.127 --> 11:39.427
I'm thinking you've said "lo and behold"
about five times in the last hour.

11:39.498 --> 11:42.558
- Would you, you know, stop?
- Is that so bad?

11:42.635 --> 11:46.196
If you'd said it before you proposed
it would have been a deal breaker.

11:46.305 --> 11:49.797
So sue me. I'm basking in
my little buddy's foray into manhood.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.372
Paul, you are the master
of the double standard.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.141
- What?
- You never chuckled

11:55.214 --> 11:57.682
when the girls were foraying
into womanhood.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.480
Well, that wasn't funny.
Not then, not now.

12:00.553 --> 12:04.114
But you gotta admit,
with Rory, it's kinda cute.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.987
Well... well, you think it's cute.

12:07.093 --> 12:10.529
- I think it's a little sad.
- I know, lo and behold, he's...

12:10.596 --> 12:14.032
Is this gonna be like the time
you said "vis-a-vis" for six months?

12:14.100 --> 12:15.761
I'm sorry.

12:16.635 --> 12:21.072
Anyway, you know, I heard on the radio
that 30 percent of kids

12:21.140 --> 12:25.008
are sexually active by the time they
are freshmen. Can you believe that?

12:25.077 --> 12:27.637
Things have sure changed
since we were in college.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.511
- Freshmen in high school.
- No! Don't say...

12:30.583 --> 12:32.676
So what?
You're saying you think Rory is...

12:32.752 --> 12:35.619
No. No, no, no.
I'm just saying this is another thing

12:35.688 --> 12:37.849
to worry about
and to prepare our kids for.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.721
'Cause Rory's not a teenager,
you know, vis-a-vis...

12:40.793 --> 12:42.852
- I swear to God, vis-a-vis...
- Sorry.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.488
Yeah, but he's nearly in high school.

12:45.598 --> 12:49.261
I remember when I was his age, I barely
had the nerve to hold a girl's hand.

12:49.335 --> 12:52.827
I mean, mine would literally tremble
whenever I'd reach for hers.

12:52.905 --> 12:54.532
- Aw!
- You know what it's like.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.371
You remember what you were like
when you were that age.

12:58.711 --> 13:02.272
Yes. Yeah, I...
Yes, I do remember that.

13:02.381 --> 13:04.246
Good night, Paul.

13:07.987 --> 13:10.888
- [up-tempo music on TV]
- Kids?

13:10.956 --> 13:13.925
What are you doing up so late?
It's a school night.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.084
We couldn't sleep.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.822
- We were scared.
- Shh.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.231
As long as you're up...

13:20.299 --> 13:22.324
- What do you want, Dad?
- Well, I just...

13:22.401 --> 13:24.961
I'm doing this research
on a column.

13:25.037 --> 13:28.939
Oh, is it about double standards, 'cause
you already know a lot about that.

13:29.008 --> 13:34.105
No. Although, and you're gonna laugh,
it does touch on that.

13:35.281 --> 13:38.045
Uh-oh. He wants to ask us about sex.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.953
Yes, sex is a complex
and difficult decision.

13:42.021 --> 13:44.785
We will not let peer pressure
dictate our actions.

13:46.926 --> 13:51.022
- Oh, God, you are so not Celine Dion.
- Would you... would you stop with this?

13:51.096 --> 13:52.188
Now, it's...

13:52.264 --> 13:56.564
Actually, I don't wanna talk about you.
I'd like to talk about other kids.

13:56.635 --> 14:01.595
Theoretically... do you think that...
a lot of them are...

14:01.707 --> 14:04.801
...you know... sexually active?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.814
Define "sexually active."

14:10.349 --> 14:13.785
- Do you want to be home-schooled?
- Hey, girls! Girls!

14:13.853 --> 14:15.514
Come on! Please.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.521
I don't know, Dad.
I mean, I wouldn't say a lot.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.650
Oh, good.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.024
- Probably... one in three.
- Yeah, about that.

14:23.095 --> 14:24.756
Oh, except the band kids.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.289
The band kids?

14:28.367 --> 14:30.995
- Oh, yeah, they're like rabbits.
- Uh-huh.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.771
I need to sit down.

14:34.773 --> 14:39.267
Dad, a lot of kids realize that you only
have one chance for a first time,

14:39.345 --> 14:43.304
so, it's kinda worth waiting for until
you're absolutely sure you're ready.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.850
Wow, Beach.

14:45.918 --> 14:48.045
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.687
I know.

14:57.529 --> 15:00.896
Cate, I've been thinking about this
thing with Rory since last night.

15:00.966 --> 15:04.697
What if Rory is one of the one in three?
Or Sabrina is one of the one in three?

15:04.770 --> 15:08.729
And what's one in three times one in
three? Quick, get Kerry down here. No.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.173
- Get Bridget.
- OK.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.007
- OK, Paul, you have to calm down.
- What? I'm calm.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.444
Take a deep breath.

15:15.514 --> 15:19.075
You know, maybe you just need
to have another talk with Rory.

15:19.184 --> 15:23.518
You know, advanced birds and bees
without the nature videos and giggling.

15:24.590 --> 15:28.856
That's your answer for everything?
Communicating, dealing with the problem.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.795
Where do you come up
with this stuff? It's not that easy.

15:31.864 --> 15:34.094
Oh, really? Huh.

15:34.166 --> 15:37.932
Um, Kerry, I just got a call
from your history teacher.

15:38.003 --> 15:40.767
Missing homework assignments?
Explain, please.

15:40.839 --> 15:43.672
What's the point in studying?
Bridget's the smart one.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.903
Bridget's the everything.
What do I care?

15:45.978 --> 15:49.038
All right, honey, look,
I know you feel bad right now,

15:49.114 --> 15:52.379
but this is one test,
taken on one day in your lifetime.

15:52.451 --> 15:56.478
That doesn't make me feel better!
School was the one thing I was good at.

15:56.555 --> 15:59.217
It was my thing.
Bridget's got everything else.

15:59.291 --> 16:03.990
Now she's suddenly Miss Ninety-Second
Percentile. I mean, that's not fair.

16:04.063 --> 16:07.430
All right, honey, just try this:

16:07.533 --> 16:09.763
- Get over it.
- What?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.437
Good one, Mom.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.333
And you... smart girl
with the smart mouth.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.568
You are obviously underachieving,

16:17.643 --> 16:21.374
so I am sentencing you to two hours
of homework a night, every night,

16:21.447 --> 16:24.814
until I see an improvement
in your grades. Every night.

16:24.917 --> 16:29.581
What?! No, no. It was a fluke!
I'm stupid. S-T-O-O-P-l-D.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.815
See?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.921
- Too late. You're smart.
- [Bridget groans]

16:33.993 --> 16:35.756
- Ha-ha! Good one, Mom.
- Shut up!

16:35.828 --> 16:37.318
Well, you know what...

16:37.396 --> 16:39.489
Now, that's how you give a talk.

16:39.565 --> 16:40.793
That was good.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.532
Oh, look at him.

16:45.537 --> 16:47.266
I don't hear an "aw!"

16:47.339 --> 16:50.274
God, I can smell the cologne over here.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.836
Hey, Dad, how do I look?

16:54.913 --> 16:56.778
Like a very nice young man.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.010
Aw, man, now I gotta go change.

16:59.084 --> 17:00.745
Come on, you're cool.
Come here.

17:00.819 --> 17:03.379
- Can I have some money for the movies?
- Yeah.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.787
You know, I've been unfair to you.

17:06.959 --> 17:11.224
No, no, no. I mean, I've been unfair
to you and your sisters.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.924
Come here for a
second and sit down, Rory.

17:13.999 --> 17:15.489
- Dad?
- Yeah?

17:15.567 --> 17:17.194
When Sabrina gets here,

17:17.269 --> 17:21.204
do you think maybe you could
call me Ror instead of Rory?

17:21.272 --> 17:23.434
- Ror?
- Yeah.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.373
- Like a lion.
- Oh, yeah!

17:26.645 --> 17:29.273
OK. All right, listen,
I just wanted to say

17:29.348 --> 17:33.580
that I may have gone out on a limb here,
treating you differently.

17:33.652 --> 17:36.416
- 'Cause I'm the boy, right?
- Yeah.

17:36.522 --> 17:39.252
Yeah, about that,
you know how I am with boys

17:39.324 --> 17:40.586
who wanna date your sisters?

17:40.659 --> 17:42.752
Yeah. Horrible.

17:42.828 --> 17:46.525
No, well, let's just say "cautious."
But I have to be careful,

17:46.598 --> 17:50.932
because I only want your...
your sisters to go out with good guys.

17:51.003 --> 17:53.062
And I want you to be
one of the good guys.

17:53.138 --> 17:56.437
- You want me to go out with my sisters?
- No, I...

18:00.546 --> 18:03.379
Ror, pay attention, OK?

18:05.217 --> 18:09.176
I want to have a discussion with you
about your behavior with girls

18:09.288 --> 18:11.848
because you'll probably
be doing more of this.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.792
Dad, don't worry.
I think I know how to treat the ladies.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.327
"The ladies?"
Who are you, Dean Martin?

18:20.432 --> 18:21.399
[doorbell rings]

18:21.500 --> 18:23.934
- It's Sabrina.
- Wait a minute. I'm not finished.

18:24.002 --> 18:25.560
- Dad, I gotta go.
- Listen to me.

18:25.671 --> 18:30.040
I want you, and I expect you,
to act maturely and be respectful

18:30.142 --> 18:33.475
towards Sabrina and any other girl
you ever might wanna date

18:33.545 --> 18:38.209
or ever even encounter from this day
forward, forever and ever. Amen.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.047
Why are you telling me all this?

18:41.987 --> 18:44.251
- Because you're the boy.
- [groans]

18:48.794 --> 18:51.092
- Hey, punk.
- Hey, punk.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.131
- Hi, Mr. Hennessy.
- Sabrina.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.109
See ya, Dad.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.141
How are you doing?

19:10.215 --> 19:13.343
Did you see how she was dressed?!

19:14.486 --> 19:17.922
What was I thinking?
I wanna keep the girls in a convent,

19:17.990 --> 19:20.925
and here I'm giving Rory money
for shore leave.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.690
Have a little faith.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.321
In what?

19:26.431 --> 19:29.662
That Rory is the son
of a very sweet man,

19:29.735 --> 19:32.898
whose hand trembled when
he reached for the hand of a girl.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.907
Cate, why don't you say that louder?
I don't think the neighbors heard!

19:39.077 --> 19:44.242
- [suspenseful music plays]
- [high-pitched screaming]

20:27.459 --> 20:30.087
Uh, girls, come on over here.
You've got mail.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.652
Oh!

20:33.098 --> 20:36.556
You know, neither one of you
is the brightest bulb on the tree.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.102
- Oh, yeah, right.
- Right.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.934
It's from the state testing service.

20:41.039 --> 20:45.373
"Due to an error in our computer system,
your score was mistakenly reported."

20:45.444 --> 20:48.709
[gasps] A 94! I got a 94!

20:48.780 --> 20:50.145
Well, what did I get?

20:53.385 --> 20:55.410
Well, honey, you got...

20:58.423 --> 21:01.119
...your catalog from Delia.

21:03.528 --> 21:04.654
Cool.
