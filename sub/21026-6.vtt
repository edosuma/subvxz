To repair the rotten felloe,

11:29.033 --> 11:31.242

Well, once we've got
the felloes ready to go on,

11:38.387 --> 11:40.389
we have to figure out exactly

11:40.423 --> 11:42.736
where all the holes
for the spokes are going to be.

11:42.771 --> 11:44.358

to find the center,

11:44.393 --> 11:47.361

in each one of those,

11:47.396 --> 11:50.779

something to slide up into.

Replacing the iron tire is
the most challenging step

12:12.490 --> 12:13.802

12:13.836 --> 12:16.321
Eustace uses a primitive
wheelwright's tool

12:16.356 --> 12:17.633
called a traveler

12:17.667 --> 12:20.498
to measure
the exact circumference.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.224

is we'll measure

12:22.258 --> 12:24.640

12:24.674 --> 12:26.711
...make sure it matches up.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.335
Each revolution of the traveler
equals 20 inches.

12:30.370 --> 12:33.960
The tire actually needs to be
just a shade tighter

the wood together.

12:38.861 --> 12:41.933

means we're going to have to...

a little bit.

12:45.730 --> 12:49.147
The iron tire needs to be
exactly 1/8 inch smaller

12:49.182 --> 12:50.597
than the wooden wheel,

to make a bigger circle

12:57.535 --> 12:59.640
is just a matter
of getting it hot,

12:59.675 --> 13:01.677
which makes it soft.

It's got to be just about
a welding temperature.

At 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit,
iron becomes elastic.

Heating a small section
of the rim is enough

by fractions of an inch.
