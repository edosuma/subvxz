it?

20:12.779 --> 20:14.745
Look at me (coughing).

20:14.747 --> 20:16.247

20:17.250 --> 20:19.283
The wounds are superficial.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.869
- Ah.

20:21.870 --> 20:23.453
Now we get the highfalutin
wound.

- Sir, you're fine, just fine.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.257
- Thank you Miss.

20:27.943 --> 20:29.626

anything?

20:30.897 --> 20:34.799
- I remember my name,
I remember being shot.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.534
After that, everything's a bit
hazy.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.402
- Were you being hunted?

20:38.404 --> 20:40.238

got you.

20:47.814 --> 20:48.746
Please!

20:50.350 --> 20:52.016

20:52.018 --> 20:54.986
He robbed me and took all my
money.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.387
- You're a brave man.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.289
- No, stupid.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.858
I got shot and I lost my money.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.630
- [Daniel] What's the
last year you remember?

21:05.632 --> 21:09.400
- Um, 1828.

21:10.003 --> 21:12.303
- That's over 120 years ago.

21:13.373 --> 21:18.442
(eerie music)
(cicadas chirping)

21:18.444 --> 21:23.514
- Mia, when was the
last time you remember?

21:23.716 --> 21:25.416
- 1950.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.853
- 1996 for me.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.621
- Well that can't be right.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.922
What's happening?

21:31.924 --> 21:34.692
- It's, it's already happened.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.861
- We're being hunted.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.196
- Criminals are ya?

21:38.197 --> 21:39.530
- Right now there are some who
believe

21:39.532 --> 21:41.532
anybody like us are criminals.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.567
- What Mia means is, anyone
without

21:43.569 --> 21:45.636
the plague is being hunted down.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.205
- Plague?

21:47.206 --> 21:48.773
There's no plague around
here except the flies.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.374
- I don't know what's gonna
convince you.

21:50.376 --> 21:52.576
(cicadas chirping)
(birds chirping)

21:52.578 --> 21:55.813
- Are you really from 1996?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.782
- Are you really from the
1950's?

21:59.585 --> 22:01.686
- Let's go find some answers.

22:03.356 --> 22:08.426
(eerie music)

(eerie music)
(flies buzzing)

22:59.712 --> 23:00.644
- Why are you doing this?

23:00.646 --> 23:02.113
- What do you expect?

23:02.115 --> 23:03.647
The morgues are full.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.650
- You're one of them, aren't you
(laughs)?

23:07.720 --> 23:09.854

23:09.856 --> 23:11.239

Stand back!

23:34.847 --> 23:36.397

23:36.398 --> 23:37.948
- Stand back or I'll kill the
lady.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.550
- There's a reward for clean
skin.

23:39.552 --> 23:40.718
- But I'm not a rebel.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.585
- I don't care who you are.
- Please!

23:41.587 --> 23:42.453

¶ Oo ¶

25:03.769 --> 25:05.002
You must be with the rebels.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.236
- Thank you, but we're not
rebels.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.591
- You don't have the plague.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.509
In the world's eyes that makes
you rebels.

25:12.512 --> 25:17.081
(eerie music)
(birds chirping)

25:17.083 --> 25:18.849
You are not safe.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.852
The name's Jude.

25:21.854 --> 25:25.222
- Mia, and this is Daniel and
Jack.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.192
- In response to the plague,

25:28.194 --> 25:29.994
the world ordered all the clean
skin's

25:29.996 --> 25:33.230
hunted down for these vaccine
vials.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.200
- We have no vials.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.002
- No, no.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.271
It is all a lie.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.106
There is no cure.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.977
- Jude, you're not making any
sense.

25:46.979 --> 25:51.115
- Yet, you are being hunted,
every last one of you.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.017
Look to the smoke in the
horizon.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.752
The world's cities are burning.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.788
You're not safe here.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.722
- We know.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.292

you folk knew we were coming.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.884
- We call them our guardians.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.752
You might call them something
else.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.605
Well they certainly helped us

35:58.606 --> 36:00.356
and now they're going to help
you.

36:00.359 --> 36:02.559
- We could have done this on our
own.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.361

now.

devastation?

36:17.876 --> 36:19.242
- How did you hear about that?

36:19.244 --> 36:20.810
- From the radio.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.312
- Wait, you have a radio?

36:22.314 --> 36:24.447
- We use it of an evening.

36:24.449 --> 36:25.615
- Can we listen to it now?

36:25.617 --> 36:29.686

good news.

plague.

supplies.

it's nothing like that.

- Oh, Jack you're welcome to
stay.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.808
- I'll stay with my friends,
thanks.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.676
- We'd much rather you all stay,

37:26.678 --> 37:29.012
but when they came and
told us where you were,

37:29.014 --> 37:31.581
they also told us when
you'd need to leave.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.384
- They said to send only the
two youngest visitors back.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.019
- And what of me?

37:36.021 --> 37:36.987
- Sorry Jack.

37:36.989 --> 37:38.321
Your daughter's on her way.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.956

You should stay with us.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.759

37:42.761 --> 37:47.831
(singer vocalizing)
(melancholy music)

37:54.273 --> 37:56.439
Father, father, father.

37:56.441 --> 37:59.009
(singer vocalizing)
(melancholy music)

37:59.011 --> 38:01.979
Father.

38:01.980 --> 38:04.948
(singer vocalizing)
(melancholy music)

38:15.394 --> 38:17.060
Father, remember me?

38:19.331 --> 38:23.767
(singer vocalizing)
(melancholy music)

38:23.769 --> 38:24.901
- I remember.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.470
Yeah.

38:27.472 --> 38:32.542
(singer vocalizing)
(melancholy music)

38:33.879 --> 38:35.879
- You know, after all that's
happened,

38:35.881 --> 38:39.449
we're still alive so you
should trust them too.

38:41.053 --> 38:42.986
- Jack, you have a daughter.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.989
Give her my love.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.691
I'm going to miss you.

38:47.693 --> 38:48.792
- [Daniel] We'll miss you.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.729
- Bye Daniel.
- Bye.

38:52.731 --> 38:53.997
- [Noa] Bye.

38:53.999 --> 38:57.000
(group chattering)

38:57.969 --> 39:00.837
(birds chirping)

39:06.044 --> 39:11.081
(singer vocalizing)
(melancholy music)

39:26.765 --> 39:27.630
- I remember.

39:27.632 --> 39:28.531
- Remember what?

39:28.533 --> 39:30.133
- The, the backpack.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.405
The campsite.

39:35.407 --> 39:36.473
The campsite.

39:36.475 --> 39:37.741
- Daniel, wait!

39:39.378 --> 39:40.110
Wait.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.013
Daniel, Daniel!

39:44.883 --> 39:49.953
(singer vocalizing)
(melancholy music)

40:22.921 --> 40:25.789
- Dad, how long can we
keep the kite up there for?

40:25.791 --> 40:28.057
(Daniel chuckles)

40:28.059 --> 40:30.527
- Forever, if I had my way.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.164
- Daniel, Daniel!

40:36.535 --> 40:37.634
Daniel, what's wrong?

40:40.906 --> 40:41.838
- I remember.

40:42.774 --> 40:43.706
I have a son.

40:45.444 --> 40:47.110
That was his pack back at the
camp.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.480
Luke!

40:50.482 --> 40:51.981
Luke!

40:51.983 --> 40:53.216
- Maybe he's all right.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.652
- I remember--

40:55.654 --> 40:57.454
- [Mia] What do you remember?

40:57.456 --> 40:58.121
(gun cocking)
(tense music)

40:58.123 --> 40:58.988
- Horrible things.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.056
When I...

41:00.058 --> 41:02.725
(eerie music)

41:03.728 --> 41:06.696
He was with me.

41:06.697 --> 41:09.665
(shots firing)
(eerie music)

41:09.668 --> 41:12.602
Luke!

41:12.603 --> 41:15.537
(Daniel panting)
(footsteps receding)

41:15.540 --> 41:17.474
- [Mia] Daniel!

41:17.476 --> 41:18.675
Daniel!

41:18.677 --> 41:21.144
(eerie music)

41:24.549 --> 41:27.484
Daniel (echoing)!

41:28.720 --> 41:30.119
(singer vocalizing)
(eerie music)

41:30.121 --> 41:31.488
Daniel (echoing)!

41:31.490 --> 41:36.526
(singer vocalizing)
(eerie music)

41:43.201 --> 41:45.935
Daniel (echoing)!

41:45.937 --> 41:48.605
(eerie music)

41:59.751 --> 42:02.018
- [Jude] Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia,

42:02.020 --> 42:04.954
Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia,
Mia.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.692
(eerie music)

42:11.897 --> 42:16.900
Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia,
Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.206
Mia?

42:23.207 --> 42:25.107
Future Mia, future Mia lies
here.

42:26.912 --> 42:29.112
Lies here with the plague.

42:32.117 --> 42:35.985
With the plague, plague, plague,
plague.

42:35.987 --> 42:38.721
(Mia vomiting)

42:41.192 --> 42:46.262
(wind whistling)
(eerie music)

42:48.300 --> 42:51.634
And the dead, dead, dead, dead,
dead.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.605
Lie with me or with us.

43:04.683 --> 43:08.318
Unless, unless you let me help
you,

43:08.320 --> 43:11.721
help, help you, help you, help
you.

43:11.723 --> 43:14.190
(eerie music)

43:17.963 --> 43:21.798
Unless you let me help you,
help you, help you, help you,

43:21.800 --> 43:25.034
help you, help you, help you,
help you.

43:25.036 --> 43:27.704
(eerie music)

43:39.618 --> 43:40.350
- [Mia] Daniel?

43:43.655 --> 43:46.089
What--
- Hands behind your back.

43:46.091 --> 43:49.626
(footsteps approaching)

43:50.695 --> 43:53.162
(Mia gasping)

44:03.241 --> 44:08.311
(wind whistling)
(footsteps receding)

44:20.325 --> 44:25.395
(eerie music)
(engine rumbling)

44:34.906 --> 44:37.373
(Mia gasping)

44:40.211 --> 44:42.679
- Welcome to Camp New Door.

44:42.681 --> 44:47.750
(eerie music)
(engine rumbling)

44:48.853 --> 44:51.821
Enjoy.

44:51.822 --> 44:54.790
(eerie music)
(engine rumbling)

44:56.127 --> 44:58.861
(somber music)

45:18.416 --> 45:22.085
(camp members protesting)

45:28.993 --> 45:30.927
(singer vocalizing)
(dramatic music)

45:30.929 --> 45:33.129
- [Militia] Don't look
at me you scum, move!

45:33.131 --> 45:35.998
(dramatic music)

45:37.335 --> 45:40.470
- Please no, please no,
please let me in (screams).

45:40.472 --> 45:42.071
- [Militia] Move!

45:42.073 --> 45:43.239
What are you looking at?

45:43.241 --> 45:45.007
Don't move!
(shot firing)

45:45.009 --> 45:50.046
(singer vocalizing)
(dramatic music)

46:05.830 --> 46:06.763
- Move.

46:09.768 --> 46:10.500
Move!

46:12.003 --> 46:16.439
General, we have something
of interest for you.

46:16.441 --> 46:17.306
(hand slaps)

46:17.308 --> 46:20.176
- Excellent!

46:20.177 --> 46:23.045
(singer vocalizing)
(somber music)

46:23.047 --> 46:28.117
(shots firing)
(singer vocalizing)

46:33.792 --> 46:34.457
- No!

46:34.459 --> 46:35.324
No!

46:35.326 --> 46:38.277
No!

46:38.278 --> 46:41.229
(women screaming)
(somber music)

46:42.233 --> 46:47.303
(man screaming)
(somber music)

46:51.843 --> 46:54.844
(singer vocalizing)
(somber music)

46:54.846 --> 46:58.447
- [The Enforcer] Come
on, you have to do it.

46:58.449 --> 47:00.149
- I don't wanna do it.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.918
Don't make me do it.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.186
Please.

47:03.188 --> 47:04.187
I don't wanna do it.

47:04.189 --> 47:05.354
I don't want to do it.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.857
I don't want to do it.

47:07.859 --> 47:09.125
No, man.
- You gotta.

47:09.127 --> 47:11.861
(somber music)

47:20.038 --> 47:25.107
(singer vocalizing)
(footsteps approaching)

47:29.280 --> 47:31.948
(tense music)

47:43.962 --> 47:45.962
- What do we have here?

47:48.867 --> 47:51.934
You move without my
permission and you're dead.

47:51.936 --> 47:54.403
(eerie music)

47:58.076 --> 47:59.542
I like a blue dress.

47:59.544 --> 48:00.910
- What are you gonna do with...

48:00.912 --> 48:03.379
(eerie music)

48:05.316 --> 48:07.583
- You know (chuckles),

48:07.585 --> 48:09.385
in my previous life I thought

48:09.387 --> 48:11.954
that money bought power and
fame.

48:13.224 --> 48:17.627
And then along came the
plague, pestilence, cataclysm,

48:20.064 --> 48:21.597
and now I have more power

48:21.599 --> 48:24.567
and fame then I could ever have
imagined.

48:28.072 --> 48:29.972
- But you're a clean skin like
us.

48:29.974 --> 48:33.009
- Wrong!

48:33.010 --> 48:36.045
The plague, it's lethal for the
weak,

48:36.314 --> 48:38.414
but there are some of us who are
strong,

48:38.416 --> 48:41.183
immune, not like you.

48:42.687 --> 48:47.156
So here I stand rejoining
in a, a new world order.

48:47.158 --> 48:49.425
Well the choice is simple for
you.

48:49.427 --> 48:52.595
You join us or you die.

48:52.597 --> 48:55.264
(tense music)

48:59.237 --> 49:03.673
But first you have to prove if
you're strong or you're weak.

49:07.412 --> 49:09.612
Are you strong enough to join
us?

49:11.316 --> 49:12.381
I like blue dresses.

49:15.286 --> 49:18.154
Are you a strong, are you
strong?

49:21.993 --> 49:24.627
Who we gonna start with here,
hm?

49:24.629 --> 49:26.429
Who we gonna start with?

49:26.431 --> 49:29.365
(tense music)

49:29.367 --> 49:31.233
This blue dress, yeah.

49:31.235 --> 49:34.403
(dramatic music)

49:34.405 --> 49:35.604
I like a blue dress.

49:35.606 --> 49:37.606
(dramatic music)

49:37.608 --> 49:38.574
- No, stop.

49:39.644 --> 49:40.509
Stop!

49:40.511 --> 49:41.477
Stop!

49:41.479 --> 49:42.345
Take me instead.

49:42.347 --> 49:44.347
(dramatic music)

49:44.349 --> 49:45.214
No!

49:45.216 --> 49:46.549
Take me instead.

49:47.552 --> 49:48.651
Stop!

49:48.653 --> 49:49.752
Stop!

49:49.754 --> 49:51.988
(singer vocalizing)

49:51.990 --> 49:53.356
Leave her alone!

49:53.358 --> 49:54.223
Me instead.

49:54.225 --> 49:55.491
Look, look!

49:55.493 --> 49:56.659
- So noble.

49:56.661 --> 49:57.727
- Stop!

49:57.729 --> 49:58.661
Stop!

49:59.697 --> 50:01.197
- [The General] But useless.

50:01.199 --> 50:02.231
- Wait!

50:02.233 --> 50:04.133
(Daniel screams)

50:04.135 --> 50:07.103
- No!

50:07.104 --> 50:10.072
(Daniel groaning)
(dramatic music)

50:33.498 --> 50:36.232
(singer vocalizing)

50:36.234 --> 50:38.167
- I like blue dresses.

50:39.103 --> 50:41.237
But I should wait, you know?

50:41.239 --> 50:46.308
Because, women need to prove
themselves in other ways,

50:46.811 --> 50:49.595
don't you think?

50:49.596 --> 50:52.380
And force is so less
pleasurable than acceptance.

50:52.383 --> 50:54.650
(tense music)

50:54.652 --> 50:56.085
I think I'll wait.

50:56.087 --> 51:01.157
(tense music)
(Mia gasping)

51:03.561 --> 51:08.631
(footsteps receding)
(water dripping)

51:13.638 --> 51:16.705
(singer vocalizing)

51:22.713 --> 51:25.114
- [Mia] I want to share a
secret.

51:25.116 --> 51:30.186
(singer vocalizing)
(somber music)

51:30.354 --> 51:31.754
- So, so tell me.

51:33.291 --> 51:35.357
(Mia giggles)

51:35.359 --> 51:37.693
- [Mia] You'll have to wait
(giggles).

51:37.695 --> 51:39.161
- [Matt] Come on.

51:39.163 --> 51:40.563
Is it important?

51:40.565 --> 51:44.333
- I don't know (giggles).

51:44.335 --> 51:45.267
Maybe.

51:47.672 --> 51:49.255
Maybe not.

51:49.256 --> 51:50.839
- [Matt] Now I'm intrigued
(chuckles).

51:50.842 --> 51:53.375
(singer vocalizing)

51:53.377 --> 51:54.343
So when?

51:54.345 --> 51:55.311
- [Mia] Soon.

51:55.313 --> 51:56.178
(Matt chuckles)

51:56.180 --> 51:58.581
(Mia giggles)

51:58.583 --> 52:00.416
- So, how soon?

52:00.418 --> 52:01.650
Are you an heiress?

52:01.652 --> 52:03.586
(Mia laughs)

52:03.588 --> 52:06.155
- No guessing (giggles).

52:06.157 --> 52:08.657
(Matt chuckles)

52:08.659 --> 52:12.128
- [Matt] Mia, I'll always wait
for you.

52:16.267 --> 52:17.199
Always.

52:18.336 --> 52:20.603
- [Mia] I can't even remember
your face.

52:20.605 --> 52:21.670
- Mia?

52:21.672 --> 52:26.742
(singer vocalizing)
(somber music)

52:31.616 --> 52:34.500
Mia?

52:34.501 --> 52:37.385
(singer vocalizing)
(somber music)

52:41.359 --> 52:42.925
Mia.

52:42.926 --> 52:44.492
(gentle music)
(singer vocalizing)

52:44.495 --> 52:45.628
- I remember.

52:45.630 --> 52:49.865
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

52:49.867 --> 52:52.835
Matt.

52:52.836 --> 52:55.804
(singer vocalizing)
(inspirational music)

53:02.280 --> 53:05.248
I remember.

53:05.249 --> 53:08.217
(singer vocalizing)
(inspirational music)

53:15.693 --> 53:17.626
(shot firing)

53:17.628 --> 53:22.665
(alarm blaring)
(shot echoing)

53:31.509 --> 53:36.579
(singer vocalizing)
(alarm blaring)

53:41.752 --> 53:44.853
(flag rustling)
(wind whistling)

53:44.855 --> 53:49.925
(alarm blaring)
(tense music)

54:12.917 --> 54:13.849
Daniel?

54:16.454 --> 54:17.386
Daniel?

54:19.624 --> 54:20.756
Can you hear me?

54:20.758 --> 54:23.559
(alarm blaring)

54:24.862 --> 54:27.396
(Daniel groans)

54:27.398 --> 54:29.031
Daniel?

54:29.032 --> 54:30.665
(alarm blaring)
(tense music)

54:30.668 --> 54:31.600
Daniel?

54:33.471 --> 54:36.705
(Daniel groans)

54:36.707 --> 54:37.640
Listen.

54:39.010 --> 54:40.276
We're alone.

54:42.446 --> 54:44.280
Can you get up?

54:44.282 --> 54:46.749
(Daniel groaning)
(alarm blaring)

54:46.751 --> 54:47.750
- [Daniel] Yeah.

54:47.752 --> 54:48.917
- Do you think you can untie me?

54:48.919 --> 54:51.854
(Daniel coughing)
(alarm blaring)

54:51.856 --> 54:53.322
- [Daniel] Just give me five,
yeah?

54:53.324 --> 54:56.342
(Daniel coughs)

54:56.343 --> 54:59.361
(Daniel groaning)
(alarm blaring)

55:04.902 --> 55:06.702
Give me just a second.

55:06.704 --> 55:11.740
(Daniel groaning)
(alarm blaring)

55:20.551 --> 55:21.417
Come on.

55:21.419 --> 55:24.186
- [Mia] Can you walk?

This is nightmares done this.

(shots firing)
(somber music)

1:01:13.437 --> 1:01:15.804
- We have to get back to the
field,

1:01:15.806 --> 1:01:17.673
and I don't know how.

1:01:20.778 --> 1:01:21.777
We're lost.

1:01:23.180 --> 1:01:24.413
We're truly lost.

1:01:34.291 --> 1:01:37.025
(somber music)

1:01:42.733 --> 1:01:45.033
It shows, shows the camp,

1:01:47.738 --> 1:01:49.871
and our collection point.

1:01:51.041 --> 1:01:52.374
It's a way back,

1:03:33.110 --> 1:03:37.546

(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:04:41.578 --> 1:04:43.078
- I thought I'd never see you
again.

1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:45.113
- When I awoke, I didn't know
where I was.

1:04:45.115 --> 1:04:46.548
I thought I'd lost you.

1:06:14.371 --> 1:06:15.303
- [Mia] Jude?

1:06:16.373 --> 1:06:17.739
- How's the memory?

1:06:17.741 --> 1:06:18.673
- Getting better.

1:06:19.743 --> 1:06:21.142
Why are you pursuing us?

1:06:22.446 --> 1:06:24.546
- Because you need to make a
choice, Mia.

1:06:24.548 --> 1:06:29.451
A choice for yourself and
for your unborn child.

1:06:29.453 --> 1:06:31.019
- How do you know?

1:06:32.022 --> 1:06:33.421
- Let me help you.

1:06:33.423 --> 1:06:36.391
- Why should we accept?

1:06:36.392 --> 1:06:39.360
- Because today, a great many
will die, including your son.

1:06:42.399 --> 1:06:43.999
- Why?

1:06:44.001 --> 1:06:45.367
- None of this is my doing.

1:06:48.672 --> 1:06:51.539
There is so much you
don't understand, Mia.

1:06:51.541 --> 1:06:53.008
Let me show you.

1:07:13.697 --> 1:07:16.398
No.

1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:18.133
- It can't be.

1:07:18.135 --> 1:07:19.067
How?

1:07:19.803 --> 1:07:21.302
- I know this place.

1:07:21.304 --> 1:07:23.772
(eerie music)

1:07:26.777 --> 1:07:28.777
This place of all places.

1:07:30.347 --> 1:07:32.580

1:07:32.582 --> 1:07:33.448
Jude.

1:07:33.450 --> 1:07:34.382

1:07:42.159 --> 1:07:45.493
(footsteps approaching)

1:07:48.131 --> 1:07:49.731
- Remember now?

1:07:49.733 --> 1:07:51.266
- Everything.

1:07:51.268 --> 1:07:53.701
(eerie music)

1:07:55.172 --> 1:07:56.983
- Why?

1:07:56.984 --> 1:07:58.795
- They say returning to the
scene

1:07:58.796 --> 1:08:00.607
of the crime helps reawaken
memories.

1:08:00.610 --> 1:08:02.610
- [Mia] What are you?

1:08:02.612 --> 1:08:05.413
- We, we are the future.

1:08:05.415 --> 1:08:06.714
- [Dark Hunters] Daniel, Mia.

1:08:06.716 --> 1:08:08.616
- And with the setting of
today's son,

1:08:08.618 --> 1:08:13.655
all the concepts and prejudices
of the past will be dust.

1:08:13.657 --> 1:08:15.590
- Impressive trick.

1:08:15.592 --> 1:08:17.725
Return us now.

1:08:17.727 --> 1:08:21.830
- [Jude] But Mia, we're
here to see your future.

1:08:22.632 --> 1:08:23.698
- Murderer.

1:08:23.700 --> 1:08:25.600
- [Dark Hunters] Mia, Mia.

1:08:25.602 --> 1:08:28.570
- Yet, all of you stand
before me completely alive.

1:08:28.572 --> 1:08:31.639
(eerie music)

1:08:31.641 --> 1:08:32.607
How can that be?

1:08:33.610 --> 1:08:36.644
- [Dark Hunters] Mia, Mia, Mia.

1:08:36.646 --> 1:08:38.480
- First, the waiting.

Did you think we would thank
you?

you.

offer

that would make me accept that
choice.

Can't you feel it?

You and your child will
prosper by my side,

Accept the offer, the offer,

1:17:15.898 --> 1:17:19.634
the offer, the offer,
the offer, the offer.

1:17:22.071 --> 1:17:23.137
What say you?

1:17:24.107 --> 1:17:29.143
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:17:50.967 --> 1:17:56.037
(fire crackling)
(wind whistling)

1:18:16.759 --> 1:18:18.292
Time has run out.

1:18:21.097 --> 1:18:22.396
There is not escape.

1:18:23.900 --> 1:18:26.400
This is humanities last day on
Earth.

1:18:27.403 --> 1:18:28.335
- No hope.

1:18:30.740 --> 1:18:31.706
- None.

1:18:33.276 --> 1:18:35.342
Soon, there will be a new world,

1:18:36.245 --> 1:18:39.480
where the concepts and
hopes of the past are dust.

1:18:39.482 --> 1:18:42.349
(fire crackling)

1:18:45.455 --> 1:18:46.954
Accept my offer.

1:18:47.790 --> 1:18:50.825
- You forget, I've died once
already.

1:18:50.827 --> 1:18:54.061
(eerie music)
(fire crackling)

1:18:54.063 --> 1:18:58.099
Today I've seen the world
devastation.

1:19:00.169 --> 1:19:05.139
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:19:05.141 --> 1:19:08.176
Plague.

1:19:08.177 --> 1:19:11.212
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:19:13.082 --> 1:19:16.050
Despair.

1:19:16.051 --> 1:19:19.019
(women screaming)
(singer vocalizing)

1:19:19.388 --> 1:19:21.956
Greed.

1:19:21.957 --> 1:19:24.525
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:19:24.527 --> 1:19:26.227
Hatred.

1:19:26.228 --> 1:19:27.928
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:19:27.930 --> 1:19:28.796
- [The Enforcer] You have to do
it!

1:19:28.798 --> 1:19:30.097
- No.

1:19:30.099 --> 1:19:31.749
I don't want to do it.

1:19:31.750 --> 1:19:33.400
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:19:33.402 --> 1:19:34.468
(shot firing)

1:19:34.470 --> 1:19:37.071
- [Mia] Hunger for power, fame.

1:19:37.073 --> 1:19:40.007
- But there are some of
us who are strong, immune.

1:19:40.009 --> 1:19:42.176
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:19:42.178 --> 1:19:43.210
(shot firing)

1:19:43.212 --> 1:19:45.946
- And inhumanity to man.

1:19:45.948 --> 1:19:51.018
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:19:51.521 --> 1:19:53.921
And death.

1:19:53.922 --> 1:19:56.322
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:19:56.325 --> 1:19:57.525
So much death.

1:19:58.394 --> 1:20:02.530
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:20:02.532 --> 1:20:03.931
But the light,

1:20:08.104 --> 1:20:10.471
it burns most brightly in the
darkness.

1:20:10.473 --> 1:20:14.308
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:20:14.310 --> 1:20:16.243
There's hope and love.

1:20:18.281 --> 1:20:23.350
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:20:24.353 --> 1:20:26.053
And I refuse to believe that

1:20:26.055 --> 1:20:28.155
these concepts could be
extinguished.

1:20:28.157 --> 1:20:31.859
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:20:31.861 --> 1:20:33.494
- So what do you choose?

1:20:33.496 --> 1:20:36.597
(fire crackling)

1:20:36.599 --> 1:20:38.032
- To hell with you.

1:20:39.135 --> 1:20:40.868
I'm Yesterday's Girl.

1:20:40.870 --> 1:20:45.940
(dramatic music)
(fire crackling)

1:21:02.491 --> 1:21:07.561
(singer vocalizing)
(dramatic music)

1:21:27.884 --> 1:21:30.752
Hope.

1:21:30.753 --> 1:21:33.621
(singer vocalizing)
(inspirational music)

1:21:41.297 --> 1:21:43.264
(Daniel laughs)

1:21:43.266 --> 1:21:48.335
(singer vocalizing)
(inspirational music)

1:21:54.277 --> 1:21:57.278
- Take them.

1:21:57.279 --> 1:22:00.280
(singer vocalizing)
(light beams crackling)

1:22:15.131 --> 1:22:20.200
(singer vocalizing)
(fire crackling)

1:22:57.073 --> 1:22:58.272
No, no!

1:22:58.274 --> 1:23:03.344
(singer vocalizing)
(fire crackling)

1:23:04.613 --> 1:23:06.246
They're mine, you hear me?

1:23:06.248 --> 1:23:07.748
They are mine!

1:23:07.750 --> 1:23:12.753
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine,
mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

1:23:14.724 --> 1:23:17.591
(fire crackling)

1:23:22.164 --> 1:23:25.232
(singer vocalizing)

1:23:54.263 --> 1:23:59.333
(gentle music)
(singer vocalizing)

1:24:23.759 --> 1:24:26.727
- Come on.

1:24:26.728 --> 1:24:29.696
(singer vocalizing)
(gentle music)

1:24:51.620 --> 1:24:54.588
What?

1:24:54.589 --> 1:24:57.557
(singer vocalizing)
(inspirational music)

1:28:38.781 --> 1:28:43.850
(dramatic music)
(singer vocalizing)
