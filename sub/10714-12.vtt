I don't know why you're being
like this. I give up. I got to go.

Well, don't tell your
mother. It'll kill her.

What's going on with you and Ethan?

00:17.838 --> 00:20.730
I'll tell you what's going on. I
don't want to tell you what's going on.

free to do what they want now.

10:09.893 --> 10:11.207

Ethan's a stripper.

10:41.301 --> 10:44.010

10:46.714 --> 10:48.552

10:48.554 --> 10:51.187
But... what really upsets me

10:51.189 --> 10:53.069
is that he's given up his dream.

10:53.094 --> 10:55.859
I mean, one little case of
the yips and he quits golf.

10:55.993 --> 10:58.477
Well, look, just 'cause you're
mad at him, don't push him away.

10:58.502 --> 11:01.698
I know what that's like, and it's
not good. You need to talk to him.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.500
Well, he's at that club right now.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.912
Well, we could go there. I want
to go check out this cowboy guy.

11:19.085 --> 11:20.365
Don't be a pussy.

11:21.248 --> 11:25.194
Look, going to a gay strip club
with my son to see my other son dance

11:25.219 --> 11:27.046
wasn't exactly on my bucket list.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.522
I don't see Ethan or the girls, so
let's just relax and grab a beer.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.461
Uh... uh...

11:39.199 --> 11:41.788
Jeez, what do you have to do
to get a drink in this place?

11:42.268 --> 11:43.526
Don't answer that.

11:44.433 --> 11:47.786
Excuse me. This is from
that gentleman at the bar.

11:49.061 --> 11:51.027
I knew something like
this was gonna happen.

11:51.029 --> 11:53.894
See, in the gay community, I
am what's known as a "bear."

11:53.919 --> 11:55.761
So please tell them I am flattered...

11:55.786 --> 11:57.946
No, sir. It's for him.

11:59.724 --> 12:01.134
You were saying?

12:01.906 --> 12:03.506
Seriously?

12:03.508 --> 12:06.803
Ah. Scotch on the rocks. Look at that.

12:06.828 --> 12:08.784
The gays have the same drinks we do.

12:09.714 --> 12:11.253
How could he pick you over me?

12:11.278 --> 12:14.578
Mm. Don't be jealous, Mike.
It's not a good look on you.

12:14.953 --> 12:17.388
You know what? I had my
back turned to the bar.

12:17.413 --> 12:20.263
I was slouching. He
probably didn't even see me.

12:20.288 --> 12:22.091
The gentleman has made his choice.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.497
Look, I think it's pretty clear

12:23.522 --> 12:25.857
which one of us should be
getting the free drinks.

12:25.882 --> 12:27.912
- I have another drink.
- Here we go.

12:27.937 --> 12:29.319
For you again, sir.

12:30.384 --> 12:32.234
This is ridiculous.
Let's go look for Ethan.

12:32.259 --> 12:35.095
Ah, in a minute. I want to
enjoy my two free drinks.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.186
I'll drink one of 'em.

12:37.211 --> 12:40.003
Uh, Mike, it wouldn't
be fair to my suitors,

12:40.028 --> 12:41.264
plural.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.549
Hi there.

12:47.921 --> 12:50.435
Oh, thanks for the drink, uh,

12:50.460 --> 12:52.465
but I'm just here to watch my boy dance.

12:52.490 --> 12:54.768
Oh, we're all here to
watch our boys dance.

12:55.090 --> 12:57.073
You don't understand. I'm married.

12:57.098 --> 12:59.028
- Me too.
- To a woman.

12:59.457 --> 13:00.763
Me too.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.483
Sounds like we have a lot in common.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.611
Jeez, Ethan. Put a shirt
on. Nobody needs to see that.

13:11.636 --> 13:13.803
He's not the boss of you, Ethan.

13:15.310 --> 13:17.011
Hi, Mike. What are you doing here?

13:17.013 --> 13:18.831
Came here with Dad. He
wants to talk to you.

13:18.856 --> 13:21.715
I, uh, don't know what's
taking him so long, though.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.597
I mean, basing home-field advantage

13:23.622 --> 13:26.365
in the World Series on
who wins the All-Star Game?

13:26.390 --> 13:28.022
I mean, it's just an exhibition!

13:28.024 --> 13:29.795
It should be the regular season record.

13:29.820 --> 13:31.506
Yeah! You, sir, get me.

13:33.462 --> 13:35.228
This is weird. I got to go.

13:37.432 --> 13:38.949
Thanks for staying, Mike.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.090
You know how hard it is to talk to Dad.

13:41.115 --> 13:42.800
I could use all the support I can get.

13:42.825 --> 13:44.107
Let me give you some advice.

13:44.132 --> 13:47.692
Just keep telling yourself, "He's
not a young man; don't punch him."

13:47.717 --> 13:49.203
Because...

13:49.510 --> 13:50.891
you're gonna want to.

13:51.947 --> 13:53.412
Oh, there you are.

13:53.414 --> 13:55.528
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, look.

13:56.284 --> 13:58.751
I'm here to talk and to listen.

13:58.753 --> 14:01.157
And I want you to know,
no matter what you say,

14:01.182 --> 14:02.877
I will never accept this.

14:03.857 --> 14:05.563
What is wrong with you?

14:05.588 --> 14:07.325
What is wrong with you?

14:07.327 --> 14:10.596
First of all, I can't believe
you're okay with your son stripping.

14:10.793 --> 14:12.916
Whenever I do anything sketchy, you ask,

14:12.949 --> 14:14.984
"What would Jesus say about that?"

14:15.669 --> 14:17.859
Well, what would Jesus say about this?

14:18.538 --> 14:22.733
I'm sure Jesus would be very
impressed with Ethan's moves.

14:23.310 --> 14:27.086
If Jesus came back, do you really
think it would be to a gay strip club?

14:28.983 --> 14:32.182
How am I gonna tell people
that my son is a stripper?

14:32.184 --> 14:33.684
I'm a dancer.

14:33.686 --> 14:37.192
And this is a way to practice and pay
the bills until I get a better gig.

14:37.217 --> 14:38.756
I've been auditioning.

14:38.758 --> 14:40.959
I've got an agent. I've sent out tapes.

14:40.984 --> 14:44.181
But how can you give up our
dream of you being a golfer?

14:44.538 --> 14:46.196
I'm not giving it up.

14:46.198 --> 14:48.365
I can't do it anymore. I tried.

14:48.390 --> 14:50.782
- You didn't try hard enough.
- Hey, give Ethan a chance.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.136
Mike, I'm talking to my son.

14:52.138 --> 14:53.751
You're also talking to my brother.

14:53.776 --> 14:58.040
Look, you're the one who always said
success is how you handle failure.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.810
He had a failure. He's
handling it. He's moving on.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.399
You should be proud of him.

15:02.981 --> 15:04.347
Thank you, Mike.

15:05.784 --> 15:06.984
Dad,

15:07.552 --> 15:11.446
before you came into my
life, dancing was my dream.

15:11.556 --> 15:13.718
But then you took me
golfing, and I was good at it.

15:13.743 --> 15:16.207
- You were great at it.
- And I loved it.

15:17.228 --> 15:18.795
But that's gone now.

15:20.498 --> 15:22.375
Dancing isn't golfing.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.733
But it's a legitimate career
and an honorable dream.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.728
Yo, Malcolm Sexx, you're on.

15:29.374 --> 15:31.840
And be careful out there.
The pole's pretty lube-y.

15:33.244 --> 15:34.495
I'm leaving.

15:34.579 --> 15:38.796
Uh, don't go. Just watch me dance,
and you'll see. I'm really good.

15:38.821 --> 15:40.642
I don't need to see that, Ethan.

15:41.361 --> 15:45.173
I thought we wanted the same
thing. But I guess I was wrong.

15:45.994 --> 15:48.639
Dude, never fall in
love with a stripper.

15:53.398 --> 15:57.794
All right, all right, all right.
Coming up next, once again,

15:57.819 --> 15:59.420
Malcolm Sexx!

15:59.445 --> 16:01.850
And side note, the club owners
would like me to remind everyone

16:01.875 --> 16:03.389
that that nickname is
not meant in any way

16:03.414 --> 16:05.760
to trivialize the heroes of
the civil rights movement.

16:05.785 --> 16:07.946
