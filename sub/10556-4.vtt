01:01.394 --> 01:03.385
Mr. Doyle?

01:03.463 --> 01:04.953
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?

01:05.031 --> 01:06.555
I suppose it's a book
you'd like me to sign.

01:06.633 --> 01:09.659
No, no.
We have an engagement.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.135
My name's William Murdoch.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.398
You, sir.

01:12.472 --> 01:15.373
Good God, man. I was expecting
someone twice your age.

01:15.442 --> 01:18.070
Well, there's no time to dally.
We're late.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.304
- Late?
- Yes.

01:19.379 --> 01:24.248
You see, I, unfortunately,
have double-booked myself.

01:24.317 --> 01:25.648
Here we are.

01:25.718 --> 01:27.015
It's an awful habit of mine.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.349
I do hope you'll forgive me.

01:28.421 --> 01:29.410
Of course, of course.

01:29.489 --> 01:31.957
I'm honored you agreed
to meet me in the first place.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.253
Your Sherlock is an inspiration.

01:33.326 --> 01:34.258
Was, sir, was.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.693
The man is dead and gone
and good riddance, I say.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.993
Ah, in any case,
if anyone's honored to be met,

01:39.065 --> 01:40.657
it's me by you.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.963
Detective William Murdoch.

01:43.036 --> 01:46.028
Your work on the Cabbagetown
murders, sheer genius.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.540
Thank you, thank you.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.371
Might I inquire
where we are going?

01:50.443 --> 01:53.571
Suffice it to say that you're
not the only Toronto resident

01:53.646 --> 01:54.977
who's come to my attention.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.828
My dear Mr. Doyle.

02:08.895 --> 02:12.353
What an honor, a pleasure,
and a coup to have you with us.

02:12.432 --> 02:15.367
May I present
Mr. Arthur Conan Doyle?

02:15.435 --> 02:17.426
Doctor, adventurer, and creator
of the most brilliant

02:17.504 --> 02:18.903
of all detectives,
Sherlock Holmes.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.497
And now spiritualist.

02:21.574 --> 02:24.475
Thank you very much indeed,
Miss Pensall.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.637
And this must be the police
officer you mentioned.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.544
Yes, this is
Detective William Murdoch

02:28.615 --> 02:29.877
of the Toronto Constabulary,

02:29.949 --> 02:34.181
who, I can assure you,
is not a fictional creation.

02:34.254 --> 02:37.223
Please do sit.
We're about to begin.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.985
Thank you.

02:40.059 --> 02:42.425
Tonight, we are attempting
to once again contact

02:42.495 --> 02:47.364
the unfortunate young son
of dear Conrad Hunt.

02:47.433 --> 02:49.367
The angels came too soon
for James.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.959
Are you ready, Conrad?

02:51.037 --> 02:53.130
More than you can ever know.

02:53.206 --> 02:55.538
I ask that everyone in the room

02:55.608 --> 02:58.475
think of their own
dearly departed ones.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.978
Ask them to join us
in exhorting young James

03:01.014 --> 03:04.450
to travel to our welcoming den,
if only for a moment.

03:14.994 --> 03:16.461
Yes.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.360
He's coming.
James?

03:19.933 --> 03:22.163
James?

03:22.235 --> 03:24.795
No.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.338
Not James.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.169
Someone else.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.799
A young woman.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.811
To whom do you wish to speak?

03:32.879 --> 03:35.473
She wants to talk to you,
Detective.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.415
She says she was murdered.

03:39.485 --> 03:40.509
What?

03:40.587 --> 03:41.986
Murdered?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.784
She was buried
in a shallow grave.

03:43.856 --> 03:46.791
What are you talking about?
Is this some sort of joke?

03:46.859 --> 03:48.986
Quiet, man!

03:49.062 --> 03:51.929
This young woman,
where is she buried?

03:54.567 --> 03:56.899
Here we are.

03:57.003 --> 04:01.269
Ah, 20 paces from the road,
towards the water tower.

04:01.307 --> 04:04.299
Where we will no doubt find
the elusive wild goose.

04:04.377 --> 04:06.436
Really, Mr. Doyle,
I'm surprised at you.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.242
A man of science,
being taken in like this.

04:09.315 --> 04:10.680
It is as a man of science

04:10.750 --> 04:13.241
that I'm interested,
Detective Murdoch.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.412
If these things are not true,

04:15.488 --> 04:18.389
they must be disproven
scientifically.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.154
19 and 20.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.525
There.

04:23.596 --> 04:27.430
And... 19 and 20.
It was 20.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.024
Satisfied, Mr. Doyle?

04:29.102 --> 04:30.831
Unfortunately,
there is no cable strung

04:30.903 --> 04:32.666
between our world and the next.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.902
Perhaps the message
may have been garbled somehow.

04:36.709 --> 04:40.008
But, yes, I am satisfied.

04:40.079 --> 04:43.674
Excellent, because
I am exceedingly hungry.

04:45.518 --> 04:46.746
Oh, wait.

04:46.819 --> 04:49.219
- Shh.
- What is it?

04:54.627 --> 04:56.561
There, you see.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.857
Psst!

04:57.930 --> 04:59.591
Psst, psst, psst, psst!

04:59.666 --> 05:02.499
The earth has been disturbed.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.842
Bugger.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.046
Your murder bag, sir.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.551
Excellent.
Some light, please, George.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.487
Uh, what's this?

05:25.558 --> 05:27.788
A little something I rigged up.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.226
Turn it on, George.

05:30.296 --> 05:31.456
Good God.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.362
Daylight in a box.
How extraordinary.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.594
Two sets of tracks.
One wider than the other.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.101
I'll have molds taken of these.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.694
Yes.
Yes, well done.

05:38.771 --> 05:41.535
This will be the doctor
from the coroner's office.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.170
I hope I didn't take you away
from anything important.

05:49.248 --> 05:52.046
Ah, in fact, you rescued me
from a rather wretched comedy

05:52.118 --> 05:53.312
at the Princess Theatre.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.115
You're Arthur Conan Doyle.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.120
Guilty.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.283
Yes, Mr. Doyle,
may I present Dr. Julia Ogden?

05:59.392 --> 06:01.519
Mr. Doyle is in town...

06:01.561 --> 06:03.529
To give a lecture
on spiritualism.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.496
I have a ticket already, and I'm
quite looking forward to it.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.362
Yes.
Yes, yes.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.168
May I see the body?

06:10.236 --> 06:11.328
Uh, yes.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.537
I counted two bullet wounds.

06:14.607 --> 06:16.973
This one seems to have
powder residue.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.271
Yes. The first shot
would have been fired

06:18.344 --> 06:20.107
from a distance
of at least 10 feet.

06:20.179 --> 06:22.443
I would think the second
at much closer range.

06:22.515 --> 06:23.777
The finishing shot, as it were.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.647
- Help me roll her.
- Oh, may I?

06:25.718 --> 06:26.912
Allow me.
Here we are.

06:26.986 --> 06:28.886
1, 2, 3.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.816
Well, given rigor,
I'd say she was killed

06:32.892 --> 06:34.120
within the last 24 hours.

06:34.193 --> 06:35.592
There's one exit wound.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.288
Second bullet is lodged
in the body.

06:37.363 --> 06:38.295
Excellent!

06:38.364 --> 06:39.661
That means you can match
the bullet

06:39.732 --> 06:41.359
with the gun
that it was fired from.

06:41.434 --> 06:42.366
Match the bullet?

06:42.435 --> 06:44.369
Yes, a Frenchman has been doing
some excellent work.

06:44.437 --> 06:45.768
Yes.
Lacassagne.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.829
Do we know the name
of this woman?

06:47.907 --> 06:49.534
Ida Winston.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.600
She had a number
of calling cards in her purse.

06:51.677 --> 06:52.666
Winston.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.213
We were told in briefing that a
woman by that name was missing.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.806
Have the next of kin
come round to the morgue

06:57.917 --> 06:59.214
in the morning, George.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.583
Yes, sir.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.195
Have you found
the hidden levers, Detec...

07:15.268 --> 07:18.032
Oh, good heavens.
Are you all right?

07:18.104 --> 07:20.504
Fine, fine.

07:20.573 --> 07:22.871
Tell me, Miss Pensall,
how is it you come to know

07:22.942 --> 07:24.967
the precise whereabouts
of a murder victim?

07:25.044 --> 07:27.137
I was told.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.703
You were told.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.511
Are you familiar
with Ida Winston?

07:31.584 --> 07:32.516
Well, of course.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.679
She's a member of
the Toronto Paranormal Society.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.586
Mrs. Winston
is the murder victim.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.354
- Are you sure?
- Yes, quite.

07:42.428 --> 07:43.793
I would have thought her spirit

07:43.863 --> 07:45.490
might have mentioned that
to you.

07:45.565 --> 07:48.363
The voice, it wasn't Ida's.

07:48.434 --> 07:49.594
Who, then?

07:49.669 --> 07:52.695
Mr. Doyle, if you don't mind...

07:52.772 --> 07:56.606
Tell me about
this Toronto Paranormal Society.

07:56.709 --> 07:58.404
They investigate people

07:58.444 --> 08:01.538
who claim to have
supernatural abilities.

08:01.614 --> 08:02.842
Individuals such as yourself?

08:02.915 --> 08:05.281
Yes, Detective.

08:05.351 --> 08:07.785
They have the gall
to question my ability.

08:07.854 --> 08:08.980
And...

08:09.055 --> 08:12.024
And the term they're using
is "inconclusive. "

08:14.393 --> 08:16.122
Where were you yesterday?

08:16.195 --> 08:18.686
I was here.

08:18.764 --> 08:20.925
I was conducting
a series of sÃ©ances

08:21.000 --> 08:22.365
that went well into the evening.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.459
I never left this room.

08:23.536 --> 08:25.003
And you have witnesses
to this effect?

08:25.071 --> 08:27.596
Dozens of them.

08:27.673 --> 08:31.666
Miss Pensall, I do not believe
in psychic phenomenon,

08:31.744 --> 08:33.837
and I suspect
that you are somehow involved.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.107
I was only passing on...

08:35.181 --> 08:37.410
What the spirits
conveyed to you, yes.

08:37.482 --> 08:40.748
I can assure you,
the killer will be found,

08:40.820 --> 08:42.515
and in the here and now.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.282
Good night.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.919
Miss Pensall.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.634
Do you really believe
the clairvoyant

08:56.736 --> 08:58.169
had something to do
with the murder?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.729
The woman led us
straight to the body.

09:00.806 --> 09:02.273
She may not have committed
the murder,

09:02.341 --> 09:04.036
but she certainly had knowledge
of its undertaking.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.408
Knowledge gained
through her psychic abilities.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.310
Really, Mr. Doyle.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.678
Tell me, Detective,

09:09.749 --> 09:10.909
do you think she'd hold a sÃ©ance

09:10.983 --> 09:12.814
knowing that a police officer
was in attendance

09:12.885 --> 09:15.820
and then point you straight
to a body she'd just buried?

09:15.888 --> 09:18.322
She'd be marching herself
to the gallows.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.449
It makes no sense.

09:19.525 --> 09:23.154
Perhaps not,
but she is hiding something.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.431
Thank you.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.878
Ah, top of the morning to you,
sir.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.937
Mr. Doyle,
what are you doing here?

09:42.014 --> 09:44.312
Well, truth be known,
watching you work last night

09:44.383 --> 09:46.317
has rekindled my interest
in sleuthing.

09:46.385 --> 09:47.818
If it's not too much
of an imposition,

09:47.887 --> 09:50.014
I would like to tag along
for a few days.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.455
Well, actually, sir,
it's going to be quite hectic.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.719
Murdoch!

09:53.793 --> 09:54.782
What's all this bollocks

09:54.860 --> 09:56.919
about a corpse being found
by an alleged psychic?

09:56.996 --> 09:58.486
Not alleged, sir.

09:58.564 --> 09:59.895
And who the bloody hell are you?

09:59.966 --> 10:02.264
Inspector, this is Mr. Doyle.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.971
Doyle?
As in Arthur Conan Doyle?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.234
One and the same, sir.

10:09.308 --> 10:11.367
Mr. Doyle, Thomas Brackenreid.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.412
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.470
- Call me Arthur.
- Arthur.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.675
I'm a big fan of yours.
A bit of a shocker,

10:17.750 --> 10:19.274
what happened
in your last "Sherlock. "

10:19.352 --> 10:21.377
I trust you'll find a way
to bring him back, no doubt.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.580
As a ghost, perhaps?

10:22.655 --> 10:25.556
An interesting idea,
but I think not.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.422
What brings you
to our humble station?

10:27.493 --> 10:30.018
- Your Detective Murdoch.
- Murdoch?

10:30.096 --> 10:32.758
Yes, I was hoping
that I could accompany him

10:32.832 --> 10:33.764
on his latest case.

10:33.833 --> 10:34.925
Murdoch, why?

10:35.001 --> 10:36.093
Research.

10:36.168 --> 10:37.760
Ah, yes, a book perhaps?

10:38.838 --> 10:42.137
However, of course,
I understand if you're too busy.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.334
He told you that?

10:43.409 --> 10:45.274
Well, sir, with the Aitken
murder and now...

10:45.344 --> 10:46.276
Nonsense, Detective!

10:46.345 --> 10:48.336
I think you two make
a lovely couple.

10:48.414 --> 10:49.779
Now, do you need
some office space?

10:49.849 --> 10:51.146
Perkins, clear out your desk!

10:51.217 --> 10:52.411
- This way, Arthur.
- Thank you.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.975
- Which one's Perkins?
- Uh, the big one.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.385
- Ah, he is a big lad, isn't he?
- Yes.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.923
It took me almost an hour
to find the bullet.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.515
It was lodged
in her spinal cord.

11:00.559 --> 11:03.153
- Always the last place to look.
- Of course.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.857
That was meant as a joke,
Mr. Doyle.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.159
Of course.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.167
Ahh.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.999
I'm afraid the bullet's far
too damaged to be of any use.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.800
Do you have a time of death?

11:13.873 --> 11:16.535
Midnight the night before last,
give or take three hours.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.077
That would corroborate
Miss Pensall's alibi.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.373
I take it you're not averse

11:20.446 --> 11:21.970
to the sight of congealed blood,
Mr. Doyle.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.676
My dear lady, I have been
performing postmortems

11:24.750 --> 11:26.877
long before it became
the purview of women.

11:26.952 --> 11:29.420
Perhaps you'd care
to demonstrate.

11:30.656 --> 11:33.557
Yes, well, I have not been
a doctor since...

11:33.626 --> 11:36.424
Well, truth be told,
I was never much of one,

11:36.495 --> 11:37.894
which is why I became a writer.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.727
And what sort of writer
kills off his finest character?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.769
One which does not want to be
shackled to his own creation.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.537
Oh, Lord Jesus.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.507
Have the next of kin arrived,
George?

11:50.576 --> 11:52.544
That would be the husband, sir,
and I'm afraid not.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.408
Said he couldn't possibly
come down now.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.209
To identify his wife?

11:56.282 --> 11:58.750
Too distraught, I believe.
He sent this along, sir.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.876
What is it?

12:04.590 --> 12:06.080
Have you an address, George?

12:10.096 --> 12:12.792
Mr. Winston,
I'm Detective William Murdoch.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.355
My condolences.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.492
This is an acquaintance of mine,
Mr. Doyle.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.127
Our fine police force.

12:18.204 --> 12:19.865
If you'd acted
on my missing person's report,

12:19.939 --> 12:20.963
my wife might still be alive.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.201
Perhaps we could speak
in private.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.401
Can this not wait?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.775
We're in a house of mourning.

12:26.846 --> 12:30.441
I am trying to find the person
or persons responsible

12:30.516 --> 12:31.642
for your wife's murder.

12:31.717 --> 12:32.809
Do you care to help me?

12:32.885 --> 12:35.410
Forgive me, Detective.

12:35.488 --> 12:39.618
As you can well imagine,
it's been a trying day.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.125
Of course.

12:41.193 --> 12:43.753
Is there anything you can tell
me about your wife's activities

12:43.829 --> 12:45.160
the day that she went missing?

12:45.231 --> 12:47.495
I was at my practice
and couldn't say for certain.

12:47.566 --> 12:49.534
I suspect, however,
that she was at the offices

12:49.602 --> 12:50.660
of the Paranormal Society.

12:50.736 --> 12:51.794
What makes you say that?

12:51.871 --> 12:54.032
Because, Detective,
she had fallen more and more

12:54.106 --> 12:56.006
under the influence
of those people.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.513
Might there by anyone
to corroborate your whereabouts

13:03.582 --> 13:04.571
that evening?

13:04.650 --> 13:07.278
I was at the hospital,
tending to a patient.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.878
Now, I ask that you
please leave.

13:13.859 --> 13:17.522
And you, a fellow doctor,
lending your name

13:17.596 --> 13:20.360
to these fools who pretend
to speak to the dead.

13:20.432 --> 13:21.490
Shame on you.

13:30.709 --> 13:31.937
Excuse me, sir.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.444
Detective William Murdoch.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.343
Yes.
How do you do, Detective?

13:35.414 --> 13:37.974
Couldn't help but overhear.
Terrible tragedy.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.041
Honor to meet you, Mr. Doyle.
Frederick Waters.

13:40.119 --> 13:42.587
Looking forward to your talk.
Shame about the circumstances.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.316
And the upset.

13:44.390 --> 13:45.914
There's no need to apologize,
man.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.424
Did you know the deceased well?

13:47.493 --> 13:48.926
I did.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.861
In what capacity?

13:51.931 --> 13:54.559
Why, as a member of
the Toronto Paranormal Society,

13:54.633 --> 13:59.070
of which I am the head
and she, um, an adherent.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.536
What exactly is an adherent?

14:00.573 --> 14:01.631
Lots of fakers at the moment.

14:01.707 --> 14:02.731
Madame This, The Amazing That.

14:02.808 --> 14:04.139
Taking advantage
of the vulnerable.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.178
Mrs. Winston, like myself,

14:06.245 --> 14:08.907
dedicated to exposing
these frauds.

14:08.981 --> 14:11.074
Identifying true clairvoyants.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.174
Mr. Winston seemed upset

14:12.251 --> 14:14.151
at his wife's involvement
with the Society.

14:14.220 --> 14:17.018
Well, we're a devoted group.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.580
Long hours.
Perhaps too long for some.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.718
What is your opinion
of Miss Pensall?

14:22.795 --> 14:25.525
Certain members
convinced of her ability.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.964
Well, that's certainly
understandable.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.557
We have witnessed them
ourselves.

14:29.635 --> 14:30.761
Which members, exactly?

14:30.836 --> 14:33.703
Conrad Hunt, for one,
would be lost without her.

14:33.772 --> 14:36.002
I trust this makes you
a believer.

14:36.075 --> 14:39.306
I've seen things, Detective.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.142
Things I can't explain.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.375
What was Mrs. Winston's stance
on all of this?

14:44.450 --> 14:48.045
Less convinced.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.645
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me,
must be going.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.781
Certainly.

14:55.027 --> 14:58.326
Was Ida Winston about to reveal
Miss Pensall as a fraud?

14:58.430 --> 15:00.660
And if she was, potentially,

15:00.699 --> 15:04.430
she would have been a threat to
her reputation, her livelihood.

15:04.503 --> 15:08.098
If Miss Pensall's authenticity
is in question,

15:08.173 --> 15:10.164
I have a suggestion.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.641
A sÃ©ance?

15:11.710 --> 15:13.735
Gotcha!

15:13.812 --> 15:15.541
Are you stark raving mad,
Murdoch?

15:15.614 --> 15:17.844
I'm afraid the idea was mine,
Inspector.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.407
Yours, Mr. Doyle?

15:19.485 --> 15:20.509
Yes, Inspector, I realize

15:20.586 --> 15:22.247
that this must seem absurd
to you, sir.

15:22.321 --> 15:25.188
Mr. Doyle,
this is not the literary world.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.782
As police officers, we're
obligated to build our cases

15:27.860 --> 15:29.555
based on concrete evidence.

15:29.628 --> 15:31.255
But, Detective, we both know

15:31.330 --> 15:33.525
there are numerous ways
of uncovering that evidence.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.397
And you believe a sÃ©ance
might shed some light on things?

15:36.468 --> 15:38.231
- I do.
- Nonsense.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.794
I fear this would be
nothing more than a diversion.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.464
Perhaps.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.235
But the spirit
could give us a clue

15:43.309 --> 15:45.004
as to the killer's identity.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.874
Or it may be that you'll
just be able to prove

15:46.946 --> 15:48.914
that the clairvoyant is a fake,
in which case,

15:48.981 --> 15:52.109
you'll have reason
to suspect her of complicity.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.981
Point taken, Mr. Doyle.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.452
Proceed with the sÃ©ance,
Murdoch.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.529
Close your eyes.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.532
Concentrate.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.592
Think of your loved ones.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.533
Exhort them to ask
the young woman

16:14.606 --> 16:16.631
that came to me yesterday
to appear again.

16:16.709 --> 16:20.509
Have them tell her
that there's nothing to fear.

16:20.579 --> 16:22.604
Think of them.

16:22.681 --> 16:25.514
Speak to them.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.529
It's a...

16:44.603 --> 16:46.764
a beautiful park.

16:48.807 --> 16:52.004
And there's laughter.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.477
A silver horse.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.741
A woman in red.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.248
She's beautiful, this woman.

17:05.824 --> 17:06.813
Liza.

17:09.060 --> 17:12.723
She has a message for you,
Detective Murdoch.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.595
Stop this.

17:14.665 --> 17:17.829
She... She wants you to hear it.

17:17.903 --> 17:19.494
She needs you to hear it.

17:19.570 --> 17:21.300
I said stop this at once!

17:23.709 --> 17:25.801
This is a trick.

17:25.877 --> 17:29.006
This is all just a trick.

17:50.002 --> 17:52.732
Are you satisfied,
Detective Murdoch?

18:10.556 --> 18:13.081
I was in an alley
off Richmond Street

18:13.158 --> 18:14.682
doing some service
for Miss Pensall.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.853
And what was the nature
of this service?

18:16.929 --> 18:19.124
Spirits are fickle, Detective.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.291
They don't always come,
to quote Shakespeare,

18:21.366 --> 18:22.458
"when you do call them. "

18:22.534 --> 18:25.765
I believe I asked Mr. Gall.
I won't be needing a medium.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.500
Sometimes
we need information, sir.

18:28.574 --> 18:30.132
About the people taking part
round the table.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.642
In other words, you cheat them.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.372
"Cheat" is such a strong word,
Detective.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.573
Miss Pensall, I will not ask you
again to keep quiet.

18:38.317 --> 18:41.184
You've been following me,
haven't you, Mr. Gall?

18:41.253 --> 18:43.187
Looking for scraps
of information?

18:43.255 --> 18:44.313
Yes, sir.

18:44.389 --> 18:47.756
Is that how you found out
about Mrs. Winston?

18:48.794 --> 18:51.285
I was in the alley
behind the Paranormal Society

18:51.363 --> 18:53.661
on account of all the guests
being members.

18:53.732 --> 18:56.860
My plan was to sneak
into the office

18:56.969 --> 18:58.334
and find out a thing or two.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.005
I was startled
when a figure stepped out.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.935
He was struggling
with something very heavy,

19:05.010 --> 19:06.910
which struck me as odd
so late at night.

19:10.349 --> 19:11.714
Naturally, I followed him,

19:11.783 --> 19:14.513
seeing as this could be
of interest to Miss Pensall.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.918
And I ended up
in the middle of nowhere.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.822
He was burying something.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.553
I waited till he was gone,

19:21.627 --> 19:23.959
then pulled in closer
for a look.

19:25.130 --> 19:27.758
Then I discovered
the horrible truth.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.098
- And this figure?
- I never got a clear look.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.366
Can you describe the carriage?

19:34.439 --> 19:35.929
It was a wagon.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.238
It was brown, I believe.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.574
Or black, perhaps.
It was dark.

19:40.646 --> 19:42.375
Why did you not go
to the police?

19:42.447 --> 19:45.314
Because I couldn't risk
betraying the fact

19:45.384 --> 19:48.581
that I was gathering evidence
for Miss Pensall.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.087
You didn't think to leave
an anonymous tip?

19:51.723 --> 19:55.284
No.
No, of course not.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.194
Because solving this crime
with a supposed vision

19:59.264 --> 20:01.323
would have been quite a feather
in your cap.

20:03.068 --> 20:06.595
I know you believe
I'm a charlatan, Detective.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.266
But I provide a service
to those in pain

20:09.341 --> 20:11.536
who seek closure
from those they cannot reach.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.044
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.239
Trafficking
in the pain of others.

20:16.315 --> 20:21.810
Well, I may resort
to embellishment, Detective,

20:21.887 --> 20:24.321
but I assure you, I am no fraud.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.789
And you, of all people,
should know this.

20:33.131 --> 20:34.098
Tell me, Detective,

20:34.166 --> 20:36.964
just what do you expect to find
in the Paranormal Society?

20:37.035 --> 20:38.297
A crime scene.

20:38.370 --> 20:39.837
- Is that all?
- You think otherwise?

20:39.905 --> 20:42.305
Yes, well, I can't help thinking
there's something more.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.433
Perhaps it has something to do
with this Liza person.

20:44.509 --> 20:45.771
I trust you were close.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.471
- She was my fiancÃ©e.
- I see.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.275
Well, may I ask what happened?

20:49.348 --> 20:51.748
She died of consumption
over a year ago.

20:51.817 --> 20:53.717
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:53.785 --> 20:56.413
Um, Miss Pensall mentioned
a silver horse.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.716
Does this mean something?

20:57.823 --> 20:59.848
It means she has
a vivid imagination.

20:59.891 --> 21:03.088
Listen.
You hear?

21:03.161 --> 21:05.755
- Someone's distressed inside.
- I hear nothing.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.367
Ah, very good.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.620
- Mr. Doyle.
- Hmm?

21:37.896 --> 21:40.023
Slight discoloration.

21:40.098 --> 21:41.030
Yes.

21:41.099 --> 21:44.091
This portion seems
to have been cleaned recently.

21:44.169 --> 21:47.104
A blood stain from Mrs. Winston?

21:47.172 --> 21:49.231
Seems likely.

21:52.711 --> 21:54.440
So, if her body
was lying here...

21:59.151 --> 22:00.812
...where was the killer?

22:11.463 --> 22:12.953
Mr. Doyle.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.726
Shoot me.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.824
Excuse me?

22:15.901 --> 22:17.061
Shoot me.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.695
Ah, yes.

22:19.771 --> 22:20.601
Bang!

22:20.672 --> 22:22.435
Wait.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.975
The first bullet was fired from
a distance of at least 10 feet,

22:25.043 --> 22:27.910
so the assailant
would have been further back.

22:29.481 --> 22:30.539
Bang!

22:33.552 --> 22:35.247
No.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.652
Bang!

22:42.294 --> 22:43.420
No.

22:49.935 --> 22:51.129
Bang!

22:51.203 --> 22:58.302
So, if the bullet entered
her torso through her stomach,

22:58.410 --> 23:00.207
exited out of her back,

23:00.245 --> 23:01.542
then the bullet would be...

23:01.613 --> 23:04.605
In the bookcase.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.378
Sheer genius.

23:09.187 --> 23:10.882
When we find the bullet,

23:10.956 --> 23:13.447
we can match it to the gun
from which it was fired.

23:13.525 --> 23:16.892
Yes, "we" can,
provided we find that gun.

23:16.962 --> 23:18.429
I must say,
I'm pleased to hear you

23:18.497 --> 23:19.896
putting your faith
back in science

23:19.965 --> 23:21.796
and not spiritualism.

23:21.867 --> 23:25.303
Your world may consist
of cold logic, Detective,

23:25.370 --> 23:27.235
but I'm afraid
I need something more.

23:27.305 --> 23:28.397
I do have something more.

23:28.473 --> 23:29.565
My faith.

23:29.641 --> 23:31.404
Oh, so, you do believe
in an afterlife?

23:31.476 --> 23:33.068
Yet you cut yourself off

23:33.145 --> 23:34.942
from the possibilities
of communicating with it.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.571
Common sense tells me

23:36.648 --> 23:38.809
that if we were indeed able to
communicate with the afterlife,

23:38.884 --> 23:41.580
we wouldn't require the services
of an intermediary.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.712
Yet you make your confessions
to a priest.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.518
A sort of intermediary.

23:45.590 --> 23:46.682
Where is your common sense
in that?

23:46.758 --> 23:50.592
Confession is about earthly sin,
not heavenly imaginings.

23:50.662 --> 23:52.755
But last night,
when Miss Pensall revealed

23:52.831 --> 23:56.562
that this Liza person
may have a message for you,

23:56.635 --> 23:59.195
were you not
the least bit hopeful?

23:59.271 --> 24:01.739
Well?
Detective?

24:01.807 --> 24:05.436
This book gets interesting
around page 143.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.577
Elementary, my dear Murdoch.

24:10.649 --> 24:13.482
Ida was murdered here
in my building?

24:13.552 --> 24:15.213
I'm afraid so, Mr. Hunt.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.255
I'll need the names of everyone
who might have access

24:17.322 --> 24:18.584
to the Paranormal Society
offices.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.750
We have hundreds of members

24:20.826 --> 24:22.123
who are free to come and go
as they please.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.491
Then it will be a long list.

24:23.562 --> 24:24.927
Uh, would any of these members

24:24.996 --> 24:27.294
have any reason whatsoever
to harm Mrs. Winston?

24:27.365 --> 24:29.925
I should think not.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.902
And where were you
two nights ago?

24:32.971 --> 24:35.064
With my sister, having tea.
What's this all about?

24:35.140 --> 24:37.836
And Miss Pensall,
did she have access?

24:37.909 --> 24:40.104
I don't think so,
but it's possible.

24:40.178 --> 24:42.442
What was Mrs. Winston's
relationship to Miss Pensall?

24:42.514 --> 24:43.947
If you're suggesting

24:44.015 --> 24:45.812
Miss Pensall had something to do
with Ida's death,

24:45.884 --> 24:46.851
you couldn't be more wrong.

24:46.918 --> 24:48.078
And why would that be?

24:48.153 --> 24:49.780
Because she had no reason
to fear Ida.

24:49.855 --> 24:51.447
Not even being exposed
as a fraud?

24:53.124 --> 24:55.422
In other cases,
I've had my doubts.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.554
But I can assure you
Sarah's abilities are real.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.688
She's touched many people's
lives, mine included.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.962
Yes, I'm sorry to hear
about your son.

25:03.034 --> 25:04.592
I lost him two years ago.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.069
And now you believe
you have a conduit to him?

25:08.306 --> 25:11.366
Perhaps you need to lose
someone you love to understand.

25:12.978 --> 25:16.004
Thank you, Mr. Hunt.
I'll be in touch.

25:16.081 --> 25:18.606
Well, this has been
quite an adventure.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.583
Perhaps I could treat you
to a nightcap?

25:20.652 --> 25:21.744
No, thank you, sir.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.152
I've had enough spirits
for one night.

26:37.028 --> 26:38.325
Detective.

26:38.396 --> 26:40.921
What on Earth do you want
at this hour?

26:40.999 --> 26:44.526
Normally,
I require some advance notice.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.837
Think of Liza.

26:54.913 --> 26:58.246
Send her thoughts of love.

26:58.817 --> 27:00.944
Ask her to join us

27:01.019 --> 27:03.544
to bring you a message.

27:11.496 --> 27:13.794
Yes.

27:13.865 --> 27:16.425
Good.
Someone's here.

27:18.436 --> 27:20.961
You keep your eyes closed.
Think of Liza.

27:21.039 --> 27:22.734
Think of her.

27:23.942 --> 27:25.933
She's here.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.086
William.

27:38.023 --> 27:39.217
Liza?

27:40.792 --> 27:43.955
You're still holding on to me,
William.

27:44.029 --> 27:46.896
Yes, of course, I am.

27:49.567 --> 27:52.468
It's time to let go.

27:53.038 --> 27:55.529
Release me.

27:56.074 --> 27:58.338
Release yourself.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.843
I can't.

28:07.919 --> 28:11.411
We'll find one another
in the next life, William.

28:12.857 --> 28:17.453
Now you must rejoin the living.

28:18.997 --> 28:21.329
No, no, Liza.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.198
Liza!

28:33.712 --> 28:35.771
She's gone, Detective.

28:35.847 --> 28:38.975
She's gone.

28:53.832 --> 28:55.356
What have we got?

28:55.433 --> 28:56.627
Judge Edward Danby.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.329
Died in the arms of a woman
not his wife,

28:59.370 --> 29:01.964
which I imagine accounts
for the smile on his face.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.441
That was meant to raise
your spirits, Detective Murdoch.

29:05.510 --> 29:09.002
Spirits.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.811
Are you quite all right?
You look a tad piqued.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.345
What on Earth
have you got there?

29:15.420 --> 29:17.684
A telephonic probe.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.950
I thought you could use it

29:19.023 --> 29:22.151
next time you were looking
for a bullet.

29:22.227 --> 29:23.421
It's, um...

29:23.495 --> 29:25.395
How unexpected.

29:25.463 --> 29:28.125
Similar to the one used to
search for the bullet

29:28.199 --> 29:30.565
in President Garfield's back,
with some improvements.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.797
I'll be sure to make use
of this, William.

29:39.811 --> 29:43.042
Something tells me this isn't
the only reason you're here.

29:45.917 --> 29:48.545
I attended another sÃ©ance
last night,

29:48.620 --> 29:49.678
a private one.

29:49.754 --> 29:55.715
Twice now, the clairvoyant has
claimed Liza was in the room.

29:56.594 --> 30:00.394
There were things, details,

30:00.465 --> 30:05.266
that no one could have possibly
known but Liza or myself.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.769
There are ways to say things
in an ambiguous way.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.740
Not these things.

30:14.245 --> 30:17.737
Perhaps your mind found ways
to bend the details?

30:20.051 --> 30:21.985
Perhaps.

30:22.053 --> 30:24.351
I suppose you're right.

30:25.723 --> 30:27.714
Inspector,
I normally only have one lunch.

30:28.860 --> 30:31.124
Ah, there he is, hard at work.

30:31.196 --> 30:32.561
You should have joined us
for lunch, Murdoch,

30:32.630 --> 30:33.892
instead of pouring...

30:33.965 --> 30:35.990
By the way,
what are you pouring over?

30:36.067 --> 30:37.091
Carriage tracks.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.227
These are molds
of two sets of tracks

30:39.304 --> 30:40.999
found at the scene of the crime.

30:41.072 --> 30:43.506
This is a mold of the tracks

30:43.575 --> 30:45.702
belonging to a carriage
owned by Miss Pensall.

30:45.777 --> 30:47.404
They do not match.

30:47.478 --> 30:48.945
Which confirms her story.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.140
Well, surely, we can strike
Miss Pensall as a suspect.

30:51.216 --> 30:52.774
Now, if we can only find
the owner

30:52.851 --> 30:54.546
of this other set
of carriage tracks.

30:54.619 --> 30:55.847
Have you any idea
how many carriages there are

30:55.920 --> 30:56.852
in this city?

30:56.955 --> 30:59.082
I'm only interested
in ones belonging to members

30:59.123 --> 31:00.715
of the Toronto
Paranormal Society.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.760
What you're looking at
is the future of policing.

31:02.827 --> 31:05.091
Dare I say,
the future of entertainment,

31:05.163 --> 31:07.324
books and theater,
so on, so forth.

31:07.398 --> 31:08.763
Forensics?

31:08.833 --> 31:11.461
Too dull and gory,
I should think.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.662
Quite the opposite.

31:12.737 --> 31:15.535
I suspect the public has
an endless appetite

31:15.607 --> 31:16.574
for this sort of tale.

31:16.641 --> 31:19.132
I only wish
these new methods were around

31:19.210 --> 31:20.700
when I was writing
my Holmes stories.

31:20.778 --> 31:22.405
Then you should write more.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.710
In fact,
I meant to mention it at lunch,

31:24.782 --> 31:26.010
but we got sidetracked.

31:26.084 --> 31:27.051
I have an idea for you.

31:27.118 --> 31:29.143
A wonderful story
that I heard as a young man

31:29.220 --> 31:30.653
while visiting my uncle
in Scotland.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.486
I would love to hear it, Thomas.
Unfortunately, I must be going.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.753
A little rest before the lecture
this evening.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.124
I'll see you there, Detective?

31:37.195 --> 31:38.127
Certainly.

31:38.196 --> 31:40.562
As for me, I tried to get
a ticket, but, alas...

31:40.632 --> 31:43.760
Oh, well, why didn't you
mention something?

31:43.835 --> 31:46.303
Wonderful, wonderful.

31:46.371 --> 31:49.033
I was sent to live with my uncle
in the Highlands one summer,

31:49.107 --> 31:50.938
and he told me a story
about a neighbor,

31:51.009 --> 31:52.670
whose vicious dog attacked
and killed a man.

31:56.681 --> 31:59.741
Miss Pensall's gone shopping,
sir.

31:59.817 --> 32:02.012
Actually,
it's you I wanted to talk to.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.553
Me?

32:03.621 --> 32:07.022
Tell me, Gall, what was it
you were really looking for

32:07.091 --> 32:08.683
that night in the alley?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.227
As I told you before, sir,

32:10.295 --> 32:12.729
information
on Paranormal Society members.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.594
But you didn't
need to persuade members.

32:14.666 --> 32:15.928
They were already convinced.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.403
With the exception of one.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.097
Ida Winston.

32:21.172 --> 32:23.037
But she wasn't
going to be convinced

32:23.107 --> 32:25.905
by some sÃ©ance hocus-pocus,
was she?

32:25.977 --> 32:28.172
You needed something
far more concrete.

32:28.246 --> 32:29.338
What was it?

32:29.414 --> 32:30.881
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:32.817 --> 32:36.014
Perhaps there was no man
in the alley that night.

32:36.087 --> 32:38.521
Perhaps it was you who carried
out Mrs. Winston's body,

32:38.589 --> 32:40.580
after you shot her.

32:40.658 --> 32:42.319
We had nothing to do
with her death.

32:42.393 --> 32:43.985
Convince me otherwise.

32:44.062 --> 32:47.725
We were sure she was about to
revise her position.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.768
Why would she do that?

32:51.769 --> 32:53.794
Because I had found something
out about her,

32:53.871 --> 32:54.803
and, if necessary,

32:54.872 --> 32:57.306
that would have been revealed
at the next sÃ©ance.

32:57.408 --> 33:00.138
You've been holding
something back from me,

33:00.178 --> 33:01.406
haven't you, Mr. Waters?

33:01.479 --> 33:03.709
Not sure what you're
referring to, Detective.

33:03.781 --> 33:05.476
Your affair with Ida Winston.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.745
You didn't think
this was relevant?

33:07.819 --> 33:09.719
Doesn't look good.

33:09.787 --> 33:11.254
Murdered here.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.119
Jealous lover.

33:13.191 --> 33:15.125
Do you own a gun, Mr. Waters?

33:15.193 --> 33:16.455
Owned.

33:16.527 --> 33:19.257
It's gone missing.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.957
Did you report the theft?

33:21.032 --> 33:23.796
Never occurred.

33:23.868 --> 33:25.893
Should have.

33:25.970 --> 33:27.801
Another strike against me.

33:27.872 --> 33:30.170
I'll need the make and model,
please.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.781
Didn't kill her.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.977
No reason.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.147
Loved the woman, Detective.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.354
Then who did?

33:52.530 --> 33:55.590
Frederick Waters is a cunning,
treacherous no-account

33:55.666 --> 33:58.362
who had the temerity to appear
in my house of mourning.

33:58.469 --> 34:00.198
But instead of confronting him,

34:00.238 --> 34:01.865
you snuck
into the Paranormal Society

34:01.939 --> 34:03.804
and shot your wife
in a fit of jealousy.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.240
If there's anyone
I would have shot,

34:05.309 --> 34:06.241
it would be Frederick.

34:06.310 --> 34:07.834
That man was trying to destroy
my life.

34:07.912 --> 34:10.244
Do you own a gun, Mr. Winston?

34:10.313 --> 34:12.077
A rifle,
which I use for hunting.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.277
Forgive me for saying so,

34:14.351 --> 34:17.446
but you don't seem terribly
shaken by your wife's death.

34:17.522 --> 34:20.786
Grief is a private matter,
Detective.

34:20.858 --> 34:22.757
We all have our own methods
of coping.

34:24.128 --> 34:26.426
Ida and I had talked things
through.

34:26.496 --> 34:29.659
She was breaking it off with
Frederick and coming back to me.

34:30.701 --> 34:33.431
That's not what Mr. Waters
led me to believe.

34:33.504 --> 34:36.530
She came to her senses,
Detective.

34:36.607 --> 34:39.167
I should hope you follow suit.

34:50.788 --> 34:52.983
- Mr. Hunt.
- Detective.

34:53.056 --> 34:54.888
I'm looking
for Frederick Waters.

34:54.958 --> 34:57.052
I expected to see him here
myself.

34:57.161 --> 34:58.856
Is he not in attendance?

34:58.896 --> 35:00.693
No, most unlike Frederick.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.926
This is delicate,

35:03.000 --> 35:07.061
but, uh, did you know Mr. Waters
and Mrs. Winston were...

35:07.138 --> 35:09.572
It was impossible not to notice.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.335
But it had ended.

35:11.409 --> 35:12.933
- At her request?
- That's my understanding.

35:13.010 --> 35:15.808
And how had Mr. Waters
taken that?

35:15.880 --> 35:20.783
He tried not to show it,
but I think he was despondent.

35:20.852 --> 35:21.944
Perhaps even angry.

35:22.019 --> 35:24.010
I see.

35:24.088 --> 35:26.955
Do you have any idea
where Mr. Waters might be?

35:27.024 --> 35:29.049
All I know is the Society
is his life.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.459
Thank you.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.561
In the last few years,

35:39.637 --> 35:42.265
a new idea has arisen

35:42.340 --> 35:46.174
to replace the cold,
dead religions of the world.

35:46.244 --> 35:50.578
This new idea
we call spiritualism,

35:50.648 --> 35:54.709
which holds that alongside
this material world

35:54.785 --> 35:56.309
there exists another world.

35:56.387 --> 36:00.016
A world that is
just as real as this one.

36:00.124 --> 36:02.422
Most of us can't see
this other world

36:02.460 --> 36:04.758
and therefore deny
its very presence.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.057
But there are among us

36:06.130 --> 36:09.031
those who have been endowed
with a very special gift.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.159
The gift of clairvoyance.

36:12.303 --> 36:15.602
Now, I myself have seen
these spirit sensitives

36:15.673 --> 36:17.800
make contact with the dead.

36:17.875 --> 36:21.936
So convinced am I
that this other plane exists

36:22.013 --> 36:24.038
that I stand here before you
right now

36:24.115 --> 36:26.913
and I make this solemn promise

36:26.984 --> 36:29.179
that when I shuffle off
this mortal coil,

36:29.253 --> 36:32.086
I will return with a message.

36:32.156 --> 36:37.856
And speak to you of what lies
ahead in the great beyond.

36:53.844 --> 36:56.335
Hellhound...

36:56.414 --> 36:58.006
of the Highlands!

37:12.830 --> 37:14.661
Hurry up, lads!
Speck out.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.723
- The holding cells, sir.
- Come on, then!

37:16.801 --> 37:18.530
Sergeant Mulligan,
lock down the station!

37:23.641 --> 37:25.233
What the bloody hell's going on?

37:25.309 --> 37:26.708
Merely testing out a theory,
Inspector.

37:26.777 --> 37:27.709
What's that, then?

37:27.778 --> 37:29.336
To see if a building
full of coppers

37:29.413 --> 37:30.505
will come running
at the sound of a gunshot?

37:30.581 --> 37:33.243
Have you ever heard of
a gentleman named Lacassagne?

37:33.317 --> 37:34.477
Yes, of course I have.

37:34.552 --> 37:36.247
But remind me again.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.880
Monsieur Lacassagne
is a forensics scientist

37:38.956 --> 37:40.048
at Lyons University.

37:40.124 --> 37:41.056
He has perfected a test

37:41.125 --> 37:43.423
which matches a bullet to
the gun from which it was fired.

37:43.494 --> 37:44.188
Whoa!

37:44.262 --> 37:46.127
Uh, yes.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.722
This is the gun that was found
in Frederick Waters' hand,

37:48.799 --> 37:51.495
from which presumably came
the bullet which killed him.

37:51.569 --> 37:54.766
We fired a bullet from that gun
into this barrel of water.

37:54.839 --> 37:57.307
This is the bullet
that killed Frederick Waters.

37:57.408 --> 37:58.739
This is the bullet
that was found

37:58.776 --> 38:00.073
at the Toronto
Paranormal Society

38:00.144 --> 38:01.076
that killed Ida Winston.

38:01.145 --> 38:03.340
And this is the bullet
we just fired.

38:03.414 --> 38:08.283
Note the striations
here, here, and here.

38:08.352 --> 38:10.183
That's amazing.
They all match.

38:10.254 --> 38:11.482
So that means...

38:11.555 --> 38:14.922
It means that this is the weapon
that killed both of the victims.

38:14.992 --> 38:16.118
But what's the point?

38:16.193 --> 38:18.525
We already know the killer,
Frederick Waters.

38:18.596 --> 38:21.463
He murdered his former lover,
Ida Winston, in a fit of rage.

38:21.532 --> 38:23.432
And then with the constabulary
closing in,

38:23.501 --> 38:24.490
he took his own life.

38:24.568 --> 38:25.899
Only one problem.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.131
Frederick Waters
did not kill himself.

38:28.205 --> 38:29.536
Then who did?

38:29.607 --> 38:32.075
Some spirit, no doubt.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.440
Well?

38:33.511 --> 38:35.206
I had Frederick Waters
write something down for me.

38:36.614 --> 38:38.605
He was left-handed.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.312
The gun was found in his right.

38:42.386 --> 38:44.081
Hmm, tell me, Detective.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.747
Have you ever heard the term
"ambidextrous"?

38:45.823 --> 38:46.915
Yes, I'd already thought of that

38:46.991 --> 38:48.891
and confirmed that he was,
in fact, left-handed.

38:51.796 --> 38:53.491
Thomas,
about this dog story of yours.

38:53.564 --> 38:55.225
I've been thinking
about the setting.

38:55.299 --> 38:56.323
The Highlands.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.960
Yes, I'm not entirely convinced
it's evocative enough.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.537
- The Highlands?
- Yes, the Highlands.

39:02.506 --> 39:04.235
I feel sorry for him.

39:04.308 --> 39:05.297
Yeah, terrible shame.

39:05.376 --> 39:07.105
He wasn't much older
than you or I.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.339
No, not him.
Arthur Conan Doyle.

39:09.413 --> 39:12.940
The way he droned on
in his lecture.

39:13.017 --> 39:16.453
"I will return with a message. "

39:16.520 --> 39:17.817
How a man like that goes

39:17.888 --> 39:21.722
from devout Catholic to devout
spiritualist, it's beyond me.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.591
Beyond me.

39:25.663 --> 39:28.689
That's funny.

39:28.766 --> 39:31.894
What if it is possible?

39:31.969 --> 39:33.869
What if there is a second plane?

39:33.938 --> 39:35.200
I mean...

39:35.272 --> 39:39.003
You want to talk to her,
don't you?

39:41.011 --> 39:42.239
There were a number
of fingermarks

39:42.313 --> 39:43.245
on the murder weapon,

39:43.314 --> 39:45.441
but none that match
Frederick Waters.

39:45.516 --> 39:47.541
Well, then, the gun must have
been placed into his hand.

39:47.618 --> 39:49.779
Definitely not suicide.

39:49.854 --> 39:53.051
So we can rule him out
as the killer.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.922
We've already eliminated
Sarah Pensall as a suspect.

39:55.993 --> 39:59.429
And Hubert Winston
had reconciled with Ida.

39:59.497 --> 40:02.125
That only leaves
the Toronto Paranormal Society.

40:02.199 --> 40:05.134
And at the top
of that list is Conrad Hunt.

40:05.202 --> 40:08.137
Why would he want
Mrs. Winston dead?

40:08.205 --> 40:11.538
Because she was a threat
to Miss Pensall.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.236
Enough to kill her?

40:14.645 --> 40:16.340
I know how desperate one can be

40:16.414 --> 40:18.848
to contact a loved one
beyond their reach.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.384
Given the right conditions,

40:21.452 --> 40:23.113
one might take drastic measures

40:23.187 --> 40:24.779
to ensure that connection
is never lost.

40:24.855 --> 40:27.517
If Hunt is our man,

40:27.591 --> 40:30.151
the evidence against him
is tenuous.

40:30.227 --> 40:33.287
And he's not likely to up
and confess now, is he?

40:34.465 --> 40:36.956
Actually, he might.

40:43.307 --> 40:46.299
He's here.
James?

40:48.112 --> 40:49.773
You have a message
for your father?

40:49.847 --> 40:50.779
Yes, I'll tell him.

40:50.848 --> 40:52.577
What is it, Sarah?
What does he say?

40:52.650 --> 40:53.810
He says something
is troubling you.

40:53.884 --> 40:56.318
What?
Troubling me?

40:56.387 --> 40:57.820
That you're living
under a dark cloud.

40:57.922 --> 41:01.483
That you're afraid that he's
going to drift away from you.

41:01.525 --> 41:03.152
There's darkness between you.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.216
Darkness?

41:10.468 --> 41:13.062
Darkness is in your soul,
Father.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.195
- James?
- I'm leaving.

41:14.271 --> 41:16.466
I've come to say goodbye.

41:16.540 --> 41:17.768
No, no!
Why?

41:17.842 --> 41:20.936
There's a river of blood.
I can't cross it.

41:21.011 --> 41:23.138
Blood.
James, there is no blood.

41:23.214 --> 41:24.875
The lies have to stop, Father.

41:24.949 --> 41:26.678
James, I would never lie to you.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.377
Something's happened to you,
what you've become.

41:28.452 --> 41:30.044
Nothing's happened.
Nothing's changed.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.052
It's because of me.

41:31.121 --> 41:32.418
- No!
- Yes.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.889
She didn't have to die.

41:33.958 --> 41:35.050
You killed her because of me.

41:35.125 --> 41:36.683
No, James, please.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.159
I have to leave, Father,
for your sake.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.527
- For your sake, Father.
- No, James, don't go!

41:40.598 --> 41:42.156
I didn't do it for you.
I did it for us.

41:42.233 --> 41:44.133
James, I did it for us!

41:49.006 --> 41:49.938
He's gone.

41:52.443 --> 41:53.933
James.

41:54.011 --> 41:56.377
James.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.981
Ida Winston was going to
discredit Miss Pensall,

42:02.052 --> 42:03.041
wasn't she?

42:08.359 --> 42:10.384
You would have lost your son.

42:13.731 --> 42:16.222
I couldn't bear to lose him
again.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.929
And Frederick Waters?
Why did you kill him?

42:30.915 --> 42:32.314
I had to kill him.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.248
To throw you off the scent.

42:34.318 --> 42:35.580
Do you understand?

42:37.021 --> 42:39.182
I understand grief all too well.

42:39.256 --> 42:41.656
But the murders of two people...

42:41.725 --> 42:43.556
Mr. Hunt, you are under arrest.

42:43.627 --> 42:46.721
I'd do anything, anything
to speak with him again.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.563
Well done, Detective.

42:52.536 --> 42:54.265
Well done.

43:00.010 --> 43:01.773
So, Hunt killed Waters

43:01.845 --> 43:03.608
hoping it would look like
a lover's quarrel.

43:03.681 --> 43:05.239
He knew we were closing in.

43:05.316 --> 43:06.943
No, no, you were closing in.

43:07.017 --> 43:07.949
Uh, right, then, Arthur,

43:08.018 --> 43:09.883
I'll drop you at the train
station, me old mucker.

43:09.954 --> 43:11.819
By all means.
I can't wait to hear the end

43:11.889 --> 43:13.652
of this "Hellhound of the Moors"
story.

43:13.724 --> 43:15.419
Highlands.
"Hellhounds of the Highlands. "

43:15.492 --> 43:17.983
Yes, I'll be with you
in a moment.

43:19.630 --> 43:21.188
Well, I suppose this whole thing

43:21.265 --> 43:23.631
has done nothing to alter
your skepticism, Detective.

43:23.701 --> 43:26.534
I will admit the boundaries

43:26.604 --> 43:30.665
between physical and spiritual
happenings can be blurry.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.504
It's a step.

43:32.576 --> 43:35.477
It has been a great pleasure
to meet you, Detective Murdoch.

43:35.546 --> 43:36.604
Likewise, Mr. Doyle.

43:43.554 --> 43:45.852
I'd like to thank you
for all of your help.

43:45.923 --> 43:50.292
I know at times I was
somewhat difficult, and I...

43:50.361 --> 43:51.953
You're welcome.

43:54.098 --> 43:55.190
Miss Pensall,

43:55.265 --> 43:59.463
I was wondering if you could
help me speak to Liza again.

43:59.570 --> 44:02.368
I'm sorry.

44:02.406 --> 44:05.534
Liza gave you her message
already, Detective.

44:09.613 --> 44:10.978
Good evening.
