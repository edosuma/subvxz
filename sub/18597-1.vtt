<i>Buenos dias, buenos dias.</i>

01:53.313 --> 01:56.578
<i>You coming early today.
I'm almost not finish.</i>

01:56.649 --> 01:59.447
<i>But don't worry,
I'm finish.</i>

01:59.519 --> 02:01.578
I gotta get to school.

02:02.655 --> 02:05.215
Come in, come in.

02:05.291 --> 02:09.523
Always with you young boys,
always in a rush, always in a rush.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.472
Marisol already
leave for school.

02:24.544 --> 02:27.479
She has not missed one day
of school in three year.

02:27.547 --> 02:30.414
Sit down, sit down.

02:30.483 --> 02:33.919
You like some milk?
Some milk and cookie?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.922
I have some nice
chocolate chip.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.584
You like Marisol?

02:39.659 --> 02:42.651
Marisol, she always
asking about you:

02:42.729 --> 02:47.689
<i>Why he don't talk to me
at the school?"</i>

02:47.767 --> 02:50.827
<i>You have a girlfriend?</i>

02:50.904 --> 02:54.135
Ahhh, you already
liking somebody.

02:54.207 --> 02:58.735
You are young.
Is plenty of time.

02:58.811 --> 03:03.748
Soon you get tired of her,
and then you talk to my Marisol.

03:03.816 --> 03:08.753
And I'm always telling her,

03:12.392 --> 03:15.156
So take your time.
It's okay. "

03:15.228 --> 03:19.460
Because I always tell her a word

03:19.532 --> 03:23.468
<i>- Half a brick means 20,
- Yes, yes, of course, 20.</i>

03:23.536 --> 03:27.973
- It ain't 20.
- Yes, yes, of course, 20.

03:28.041 --> 03:32.410
Esteban said I gotta take this to
Chillie's store. I gotta take 20.

03:32.478 --> 03:36.073
If I don't give him 20, he gonna
get mad. You want me to count 'em?

03:36.149 --> 03:38.117
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait.

03:38.184 --> 03:41.210
I- I-I check for you.
I- I check again.

03:51.664 --> 03:55.225
Oh, look, look.
This one was stuck in back here.

03:55.301 --> 03:58.498
I don't understand.
It's my eyes, you know?

03:58.571 --> 04:01.768
So old, not seeing
so good no more.

04:01.841 --> 04:05.208
And that's why I buy Marisol
her glasses right away.

04:05.278 --> 04:08.304
So she don't have no trouble
with her eyes like me.

04:08.381 --> 04:13.318
But Marisol is a pretty girl.
Just think about my Marisol...

04:13.386 --> 04:18.153
<i>because I want her to have a clever
boy like you, so you think about it,</i>

04:26.032 --> 04:28.125
Yeah, yeah,
they already called.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.226
Then why they ain't
ready yet?

04:30.303 --> 04:34.637
Relax. It's 8:00 in the morning.
We ain't hardly woke up yet.

04:34.707 --> 04:37.301
<i>I'm late for school,</i>

04:37.377 --> 04:42.337
Oh, for joy! It's little Fresh,
our messenger to the gods.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.248
My tag is for my friends.
You can call me Michael.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.252
You know,
it's embarrassing...

04:47.320 --> 04:50.289
<i>Esteban using this ugly
little maricon for man's work.</i>

04:50.356 --> 04:52.256
It makes me sick.

04:52.325 --> 04:54.919
What's embarrassing is,
all the work there is to do...

04:54.994 --> 04:58.623
Esteban got you workin' up here with
the bitches, that's what's embarrassing.

04:58.698 --> 05:03.260
Damn! Ugly spotted little
motherfucker. I'll fuck you up.

05:03.336 --> 05:08.296
I'm all over these bitches, nigger. Got me
a harem here like Arabian motherfuckin' shit.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.569
You ain't all over me,
motherfucker.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.771
You be dead before you touch
this good thing, fucking monkey.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.110
<i>You tripping on
your own shit, motherfucker,</i>

05:16.182 --> 05:19.777
Only harem you playin' is them five
fingers on your own fuckin' hand.

05:19.852 --> 05:23.015
<i>- That's right,
I need five bricks, Five,</i>

05:23.089 --> 05:25.489
Everybody know
the only reason he here...

05:25.558 --> 05:28.493
is 'cause Esteban skied
on his freakin' sister.

05:28.561 --> 05:31.428
Don't be talkin' about my sister.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.557
<i>Word, Esteban clockin'out
on that chocolate freak,</i>

05:34.634 --> 05:36.727
<i>He doggin'her
every chance he get...</i>

05:36.803 --> 05:39.738
<i>and she ain't nothing but a hop-head
freak riding the white horse-</i>

05:39.806 --> 05:42.536
Say one more word
about my sister, bitch.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.042
<i>You know, maricon,
I'm gonna fuck you right up.</i>

05:45.111 --> 05:48.239
Do it. Come on, bitch.
Fuck me up.

05:48.314 --> 05:51.249
<i>You know you ain't
fuckin'nobody up, Herbie...</i>

05:51.317 --> 05:53.649
<i>so shut the fuck up,</i>

05:53.720 --> 05:57.087
I need five bricks. Five.

06:12.672 --> 06:15.266
<i>Chillie, man, they're all there,
I already counted 'em,</i>

06:15.341 --> 06:17.434
You know
I got to count 'em.

06:17.510 --> 06:21.173
You don't get paid 'til they're
all counted and accounted for.

06:23.649 --> 06:26.015
What, you got ants
in your pants?

06:26.085 --> 06:29.179
Chill, homes.
Esteban wants to talk to you anyway.

06:29.255 --> 06:32.281
I gotta get to school, Chillie.
I'm stupid late.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.292
It's gonna be my second
late day this week.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.294
Man, Miss Coleman's
gonna kill me.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.956
Don't worry. I'll write you
a doctor's note.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.728
Yo, it ain't funny, man.

06:43.803 --> 06:46.533
Esteban comin' here
just to talk to me?

06:46.606 --> 06:48.540
He's making the rounds.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.372
But he said he wants you to wait
for him 'til he gets here, okay?

06:51.444 --> 06:53.571
Kick it, Chillie.
Pay me later.

06:53.646 --> 06:56.080
I'm crazy late.
Tell him I had to get to school.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.084
Yo, yo, Fresh.
Come back here, crimey.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.250
Here. Here, homes.

07:06.325 --> 07:09.658
If there's anything missing,
I'll kill you later.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.161
<i>Well?</i>

07:14.534 --> 07:17.628
Did you bring a late pass
or didn't you?

07:17.703 --> 07:21.298
Boy, who's talking to you,
me or that floor?

07:24.844 --> 07:29.781
Is this a comedy act, Chuckie?
You find this funny?

07:29.849 --> 07:33.785
<i>Then shut up and wipe
that stupid-looking thing...</i>

07:33.853 --> 07:36.549
<i>which you probably think
is some kind of charming expression...</i>

07:36.622 --> 07:39.819
<i>right off your face, boy,</i>

07:41.861 --> 07:45.092
<i>Put your things away
and find a seat,</i>

07:45.164 --> 07:48.133
<i>Go on!</i>

07:48.201 --> 07:51.136
This is not over,
do you hear me?

07:51.204 --> 07:55.903
<i>Now, what I was saying
before that interruption...</i>

07:55.975 --> 08:00.173
<i>was that Mr, Hill told you what
the words "manifest destiny"means...</i>

08:00.246 --> 08:03.010
<i>but not what it was,</i>

08:03.082 --> 08:06.245
<i>So don't come into my classroom
with that ignorant nonsense...</i>

08:06.319 --> 08:09.413
<i>about the heroes of the Alamo
and Davy Crockett...</i>

08:09.489 --> 08:11.650
<i>and how bad they were...</i>

08:11.724 --> 08:13.919
<i>because all
they were really doing...</i>

08:13.993 --> 08:16.826
<i>was robbing another people
of their land...</i>

08:16.896 --> 08:21.856
<i>so that they could keep opening up
new territories for legal slavery,</i>

08:21.934 --> 08:26.371
<i>The papers that I gave you
have a series of quotes...</i>

08:26.439 --> 08:29.897
<i>from some antislavery writers
of that time period,</i>

08:29.976 --> 08:32.034
<i>You read the first quote, Rosie,</i>

08:32.111 --> 08:35.876
<i>It's from an antislavery writer
by the name of David Child...</i>

08:35.948 --> 08:39.042
<i>written to
the Mexican government...</i>

08:39.118 --> 08:42.212
<i>warning them about his own
United States government,</i>

08:42.288 --> 08:44.222
<i>Read it to the class,</i>

08:44.290 --> 08:48.317
<i>"Dear Sirs, There is
an impatient and almost ir-</i>

08:48.394 --> 08:52.330
<i>"irresistible desire

08:52.398 --> 08:54.366
<i>to lay hold on Texas-"</i>

08:54.433 --> 08:56.560
<i>Excuse me,</i>

08:56.636 --> 09:00.402
Where do you think you are,
the land of Oz?

09:00.473 --> 09:04.569
<i>You must be trippin'if you two
think you're gonna sit together,</i>

09:04.644 --> 09:08.444
<i>Boy, move over there,
Go on, Rosie,</i>

09:21.360 --> 09:24.454
All right, Curtis, you're
hogging the ball again. Pass it.

09:38.444 --> 09:41.038
<i>Power!</i>

back and stay with us for a while.

18:41.653 --> 18:44.952
Look, Aunt Francis, I just came
to get a few of my things.

18:45.023 --> 18:46.957
I'm not staying.

18:47.025 --> 18:50.961
Michael, you want Nicky
to stay with us, don't you?

18:52.798 --> 18:55.528
<i>Can't sleep here no more,</i>

18:55.601 --> 18:59.537
There's like a thousand little girls
running in and out of here.

18:59.605 --> 19:03.632
Like my feet are hanging off
the edge of the bed already.

19:03.709 --> 19:07.406
I know it.
I know it's crowded in here.

19:07.479 --> 19:12.473
And you being a grown woman
and all. Nicky, take my bed.

19:12.551 --> 19:16.647
Doesn't matter to me. I can sleep
in here with the girls for a while.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.088
Aunt Francis,
I don't want your bed.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.364
Well...

19:28.433 --> 19:32.301
I guess I'll leave you alone
with your brother for a while.

19:32.371 --> 19:36.467
<i>Maybe he can talk to you about
staying with us a little longer,</i>

19:36.542 --> 19:41.036
Michael ain't no one
to talk to nobody about nothin'.

19:43.282 --> 19:45.216
<i>I gotta go,</i>

20:13.312 --> 20:15.644
<i>- Michael?
- What?</i>

20:15.714 --> 20:17.739
Why you come home so late?

20:17.816 --> 20:20.842
You know Aunt Francis be gettin'
worried when you come home so late.

20:20.919 --> 20:25.288
It's hard enough on her without
you be worryin' her all the time.

20:25.357 --> 20:30.294
If she gets too fed up and gives
all of us up, I'm gonna kill you.

20:30.362 --> 20:33.263
<i>'Cause ain't none of us
can go back to our parents...</i>

20:33.332 --> 20:36.392
<i>and I ain't goin' back to
no group home, you hear me?</i>

20:36.468 --> 20:39.437
You my cousin and all,
we all cousins here...

20:39.504 --> 20:44.237
but if you ruin it
for the rest of us, I'm gonna kill you.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.172
- What up, G?
- I got ten bucks.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.617
- Get you two bottle, homes.
- It's good stuff, right?

22:01.687 --> 22:04.281
You tried all the rest;
now try the best.

22:04.356 --> 22:07.450
Are you sure? I mean,
you know it for a fact, right?

22:07.526 --> 22:09.551
Bust it, you don't like it,
you come back.

22:09.628 --> 22:12.290
Jake give you back your ten
dollars, send you on your way.

22:12.364 --> 22:16.300
Just don't be comin' back here
again, understand what I'm sayin'?

22:43.195 --> 22:47.757
No way five dollars, man. Last time
I bought from Jake, I was illin'.

22:47.833 --> 22:52.099
That stuff be stupid cut, man. Jake should
throw me a freebie, and just on principle.

22:52.170 --> 22:54.195
Yo, Consuelo,

22:54.272 --> 22:56.763
Live kickin'jumbo crack.
You don't like it...

or Howard or Lenny.

22:59.344 --> 23:01.403
Then you be ill on that
stupid baking soda, word.

23:04.750 --> 23:08.117
What you got for me there,
little buddy? What's the deal?

23:08.186 --> 23:10.120
<i>Five dollars a pop,</i>

23:10.188 --> 23:14.124
Tell you what. I'll throw you 20
bucks for five. What do ya say, homes?

23:14.192 --> 23:17.525
Five times five is 25.
Five dollars a pop, man.

23:20.298 --> 23:23.131
Look, maybe I better talk
toJake myself, you know?

23:23.201 --> 23:26.136
You know you don't be talkin'
toJake. You know that.

23:26.204 --> 23:30.732
Look, you tellJake that
I'll suck his dick good, okay?

23:30.809 --> 23:33.243

23:33.311 --> 23:37.407
Damn, you know Jake down with them

23:37.482 --> 23:40.918
All right, listen,

23:40.986 --> 23:44.183
We get in that car, I'll suck

23:44.256 --> 23:46.315
Get out of my face, bitch.

23:46.391 --> 23:49.417
Okay, how about
I let you fuck me?

23:49.494 --> 23:54.090
Okay? I let you bang this good thing
if you just askJake to talk to me-

23:54.166 --> 23:57.101
Get out of here!
Go over to Lenny.

23:57.169 --> 24:00.570

<i>- Yeah, word up.

<i>Come on, man, You're makin'me look

24:41.213 --> 24:45.149
That nigger, Kermit, he is skied. You

- Nigger owe me $50.

Oh, you don't think so?

25:13.512 --> 25:15.639
I'm gonna drop him, man!
I'm gonna cold drop him!

25:18.450 --> 25:22.648
Now you know better than to always be
in my face with this silly ass nonsense.

25:22.721 --> 25:26.953
I wouldn't ifJake paid me. But he like
always gettin' mad about somethin'.

25:27.025 --> 25:30.893
And you know I ain't gonna be gettin'
all up in his face when he like that.

25:30.962 --> 25:34.557
- So instead, you get in mine.
- 'Cause you ain't like that.

25:34.633 --> 25:39.070
My man Fresh.
My stand-up little G.

25:39.137 --> 25:42.834
You see, homes, this-
Hey, what the fuck you doin'?

25:42.908 --> 25:45.775
I was pickin' up.

25:45.844 --> 25:49.610
Don't be doin' shit behind my back!
Why the fuck you gonna be doin' that?

25:49.681 --> 25:53.173
Corky, it was my turn. Man, we

25:53.251 --> 25:58.188

25:58.256 --> 26:00.918
<i>- Sorry, all right?
- Yeah, you be sorry.</i>

26:00.992 --> 26:04.189
You do that shit,

26:07.165 --> 26:10.100
Now, am I free to finish my
little transaction here...

26:10.168 --> 26:14.264
without every nigger be doin'
some shit behind my back?

26:14.339 --> 26:19.208
Niggers be dissin' you

26:19.277 --> 26:23.941
It's all right, 'cause

26:24.015 --> 26:25.949
Yeah.

And, uh, I'll be talkin' toJake
about his temper too.

26:30.322 --> 26:33.382
It's one hundred dollars.

26:36.461 --> 26:39.055
Niggers be gettin'
$50 for lookout.

26:39.130 --> 26:43.066
I be runnin' that rock all day.
One hundred dollars.

26:45.937 --> 26:50.237
- You one bad
motherfucker, crimey.

26:50.308 --> 26:54.244
Only reason you ain't the man
is you still too goddamn little.

26:54.312 --> 26:58.271
But you get bigger,
you gonna be the man.

27:58.576 --> 28:01.374
Oh, man!

28:04.082 --> 28:08.712
I shake on a game, Fishcake.
That wasn't no game.

28:12.323 --> 28:15.258
<i>All right.</i>

28:15.326 --> 28:18.591
<i>Who's next, who's next?</i>

28:18.663 --> 28:22.064
Come on. I heard there was
players in this shit hole.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.761
All I see is chumps.

28:24.836 --> 28:27.771
Come on. Who's gonna
give me a game?

28:29.007 --> 28:31.100
Come on.
Get outta here.

28:31.176 --> 28:33.701
<i>I ain't got time
for this shit,</i>

28:40.285 --> 28:42.219
All right.

28:49.961 --> 28:53.795
<i>Play.</i>

29:12.217 --> 29:14.151
<i>Check,</i>

29:16.821 --> 29:18.584
Mate in four.

29:18.656 --> 29:22.615
Fuck you. Ain't no mate
in no four. Fuck you.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.766
Would've been four
if you were smart. Mate.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.470
Shit.

29:54.025 --> 29:56.960
That shit over there
was a waste of time.

29:57.028 --> 30:00.794
Fished me a twenty, Dad. You don't
be pulling 'em in for no twenties.

30:00.865 --> 30:03.390
Said it was a waste of time.
Time ain't money...

30:03.468 --> 30:07.734
no matter what those morons who eat that
kind of shit up may try and tell you.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.639
Anything lost can be found again,
except for time wasted.

30:10.708 --> 30:14.109
- It was fun, Dad, stupid fun. You seen
that nigger- - Chess ain't fun, boy.

30:14.179 --> 30:18.343
How many times I gotta tell you that?
Don't you listen to a word I say?

30:18.416 --> 30:22.614
- Maybe if I seen you more.
- Well, you don't, so you'd be well served...

30:22.687 --> 30:26.088
to retain some of the knowledge
I'm impartin' to you...

30:26.157 --> 30:29.354
rather than giving me all your
hard-ass street-attitude bullshit.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.597
Ain't so much fun now, is it?

30:34.666 --> 30:37.134
Gettin' to be less and less fun
every second here.

30:37.202 --> 30:39.762
<i>Uh-uh, think about it,</i>

30:43.408 --> 30:46.036
Forget the clock
for a second, Michael.

30:46.110 --> 30:51.480
What kind of player am I? Am I an
offensive man or a defensive man?

30:51.549 --> 30:54.017
That's right; I'm neither.
I play my opponent.

30:54.085 --> 30:57.020
If he likes to attack,
I force him to defend himself.

30:57.088 --> 31:00.023
If he's a cautious man,
I draw him into dangerous waters.

31:00.091 --> 31:02.025
See, you get so frustrated
playing defensive positions...

31:02.093 --> 31:04.618
you make stupid moves you'd
never make if you were thinkin'.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.392
When you come here, boy,
check that shit at the door.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.964
That's good.
That's better.

31:15.039 --> 31:19.169
I'm still gonna kick your ass,
but that's better.

31:21.913 --> 31:24.473
You been playin'
on the team?

31:26.351 --> 31:28.876
<i>No, huh?</i>

31:28.953 --> 31:31.581
Just watchin' the world
pass you by.

31:31.656 --> 31:35.092
Figure as long as you ain't drownin',
everything's all right.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.496
I don't need
no punk school team.

31:44.035 --> 31:45.969
Mate.

31:54.679 --> 31:57.443
And he got Hulk number one
and all them Thors.

31:57.515 --> 31:59.608
My old man
got all them comic books.

31:59.684 --> 32:02.778
He showed 'em to me, and they
were like all stupid number ones.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.618
- Yo, he got Superman number one?
- Yeah, he got that.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.624
He got Action Comics
number one?

32:07.692 --> 32:10.456
Word, he got that too.
He got all them number ones.

32:10.528 --> 32:14.123
Where he be keepin' 'em at?
In his garage with all them limos?

32:14.198 --> 32:17.133
- You know you ain't got no old man.
- I do so.

32:17.201 --> 32:20.466
Then we'll call him up when we get to
my house. We be givin' the nigger a call.

32:20.538 --> 32:22.597
- He don't answer no phones.
- And why not?

32:22.674 --> 32:24.835
He don't want no po' niggers
wastin' his time.

32:27.211 --> 32:30.237
Bam, Spiderman goes down.
Bam, Daredevil goes down.

32:30.315 --> 32:33.751
All them niggers is goin' down.
Punisher be takin' they ass out.

32:33.818 --> 32:37.447
- X-Men take out the Punisher.
- X-Man baby stuff, homes.

32:37.522 --> 32:41.754
All their costumes and powers ain't
shit. Punisher the real dope, homie.

32:41.826 --> 32:44.693
Word, I seen a seven-foot-tall
White Terminator nigger...

32:44.762 --> 32:46.923
with 20 guns on my roof
just the other day.

32:46.998 --> 32:49.432
Punisher be takin' out
all your stupid heroes.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.934
He be sayin', Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Take out that nigger!

32:52.003 --> 32:56.303
<i>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</i>

32:58.910 --> 33:02.107
Yo, Fresh, I been training him.
Watch this.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.341
Good boy, Roscoe.
Good boy.

33:04.415 --> 33:07.350
Good boy? That dog
ain't nothin' but badness.

33:07.418 --> 33:09.648
Ain't nothin' but badness.

33:09.721 --> 33:14.283
What up, Roscoe? You miss me?
You miss your homie?

33:20.531 --> 33:23.967
<i>Okay, okay, Mama,
I'll be in in a minute, all right?</i>

33:24.035 --> 33:26.663
I'm gonna fight him
on Sunday.

33:26.738 --> 33:30.071
<i>- You gonna do what?
- Roscoe's gonna take on Ricardo's pit,</i>

33:30.141 --> 33:32.234
Roscoe ain't fightin'
nobody's nothin'.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.403
<i>My dog fight
when I say he fight,</i>

33:34.479 --> 33:36.811
He ain't your dog.
He's our dog; I found him.

33:36.881 --> 33:40.578
Ain't nobody askin' you, homes.
I'm gonna get paid, bust it.

33:40.651 --> 33:44.348
You already gettin' stupid paid,
workin' them jobs for Esteban and shit.

33:44.422 --> 33:48.085
Yo, we see y'all later.
We gotta go.

33:49.327 --> 33:51.318
Well, I ain't gotta go.

33:52.830 --> 33:55.094
You always be lookin'
all ratty and shit...

33:55.166 --> 33:57.430
but everybody know
you gettin' paid.

33:57.502 --> 34:00.938
Yo, why you always
be lookin' nappy like that?

34:01.005 --> 34:03.439
What you be doin'
with all that jack?

34:03.508 --> 34:05.942
You be hidin'
that shit away, right?

34:06.010 --> 34:10.447
Damn, when I get paid, I'm gonna get

34:10.514 --> 34:13.449
And I'm gonna get me some
stupid gold, homes, crazy gold.

34:13.518 --> 34:16.453
Like this tooth right here
and a five-finger gold ring...

34:16.521 --> 34:20.617
- with my tag bustin' all out that motherfucker.
- You ain't got no tag.

34:20.690 --> 34:23.956
- I will when I get paid.
- He ain't fightin'.

34:24.027 --> 34:28.123
Then you gonna take me to get a
job for Esteban? Yo, man, why not?

34:28.199 --> 34:31.726
'Cause you be actin' like a
stupid little kid, that's why not.

34:31.803 --> 34:35.170
Yo, why you dissin' me, man? I'm crazy,
homie. I'll bust those dope moves.

34:37.308 --> 34:41.244
<i>Come on, Rudy, Get it in your
mouth, Don't be such a spaz,</i>

34:41.312 --> 34:44.577
- Don't be talkin' like that to your son, Esteban.
- Hey, chill, woman.

34:44.649 --> 34:47.311
He knows I'm only messin' with him.
Right, baby?

34:47.385 --> 34:49.978
You know Daddy's
messin' with you.

34:50.054 --> 34:52.248
Sure you don't want
no eats?

34:52.322 --> 34:54.348
My grandma

34:54.425 --> 34:58.953
You're a good boy, Fresh.
You be eating at home.

34:59.030 --> 35:02.488
And you be running to school
when I want to talk to you.

35:02.567 --> 35:06.799
That's okay, little homie.
I like me a smart G. I really do.

35:06.871 --> 35:10.307
You seem to have
enough time on your hands...

35:10.374 --> 35:14.470
to be runnin' those rocks
for Corky's boys, though.

35:14.545 --> 35:17.514
What, you think I got no eyes
but these two in my own head?

35:17.582 --> 35:19.914
I know where you be at.

35:19.984 --> 35:22.612
Corky got that work.

35:22.687 --> 35:27.351
I be runnin' for you once a week,
maybe twice if somebody else gets sick.

35:27.425 --> 35:29.689
Corky got them jobs.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.785
Hey, let me tell you
something, Fresh.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.661
Now, you're a smart kid, so you
hear these words of wisdom.

35:34.732 --> 35:37.064
You know,
that rock is a bad move.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.593
You start messin' with that
shit- sellin', dealin'-

35:40.671 --> 35:44.505
I guarantee inside three,
five years, you'll be dead.

35:44.575 --> 35:47.373
Or you'll have
a bullet in your head.

35:47.445 --> 35:50.175
Or that pipe in your mouth.
Either way, you're dead.

35:50.248 --> 35:54.742
Smack is the way to go.
This is a gentleman's operation.

35:54.819 --> 35:58.255
The clientele is stable,
peace-loving.

35:58.322 --> 36:01.086
The competition
is unconfrontational.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.593
And the heat,
they mostly let it slide...

36:03.661 --> 36:06.061
'cause there's little hassle
all the way around.

36:06.130 --> 36:09.759
You find your niche,
you stay there, you stay cool...

36:09.834 --> 36:14.703
and you be the man
into your 50's and 60's.

36:14.772 --> 36:19.266
And then you retire your old ass
to a nice condo someplace hot...

36:19.343 --> 36:22.107
with a lot of
niceJewish people.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.341
Leave the business for your kids.

36:24.415 --> 36:28.112
Hey, it's like banking,
only it's more secure.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.553
And you don't pay no taxes.

36:34.091 --> 36:39.028
Hey, what are you doing? You ain't
holding her right. Come here, come here.

36:39.096 --> 36:42.224
I'm trying to feed her,
in case you haven't noticed.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.736
No, you ain't holding her right.
She ain't hungry.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.703
<i>Hey, come on,</i>

36:53.778 --> 36:56.076
I'm gonna put her to bed.

37:01.786 --> 37:05.586
You know, I ain't never sold no
rock, and no kind of coke whatsoever.

37:05.656 --> 37:10.593
I never even tried it. Don't come near
that shit, not even from curiosity.

37:10.661 --> 37:13.596
Close the door, okay?

37:26.177 --> 37:28.441
It got loose on my last run.

37:28.512 --> 37:31.037
I didn't want to give it
to no one but you.

37:31.115 --> 37:34.050
Hey, my little money man.

37:34.118 --> 37:37.645
Hey, you just lost Chillie
a hundred bucks on a bet, G...

37:37.722 --> 37:40.589
<i>'cause he don't know you
like I do,</i>

37:40.658 --> 37:42.888
Hey, you my solid little man.

37:51.302 --> 37:55.398
Most niggers, they be givin'
their bitches rocks, you know?

37:55.473 --> 37:57.737
Watchin' them pop off.
Bang!

37:57.808 --> 38:00.470
They got theyself
a Action Jackson bitch.

38:00.544 --> 38:03.479
<i>Jumpin'around like a rabbit,
Divin'for that dick...</i>

38:03.547 --> 38:07.108
<i>like it's gold at the end of the
rainbow, you know what I mean?</i>

38:07.184 --> 38:09.744
Hey, not me, little homie.

38:09.820 --> 38:14.257
No, no, no, no, not me.
No, I love me a straight bitch.

38:14.325 --> 38:17.590
Maybe she like to slide
into the land of"H"...

38:17.662 --> 38:20.756
every once in a while,
a regular bitch.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.801
Maybe she fine, like a-

38:25.870 --> 38:29.431
<i>Ay carajo,
like your sister.</i>

38:29.507 --> 38:32.533
<i>Hey,your sister, she fine,</i>

38:32.610 --> 38:35.408
<i>And then she take her hit...</i>

38:35.479 --> 38:39.381
<i>and, like,
her eyes they roll back...</i>

38:39.450 --> 38:42.044
and she get suddenly soft.

38:42.119 --> 38:45.054
Oh, so soft and pure.

38:45.122 --> 38:48.057
And I am holding
my very own virgin.

38:48.125 --> 38:51.561
My Madonna.
Hey, I take that.

38:51.629 --> 38:54.223
<i>You know I take that,</i>

38:55.966 --> 38:57.866
Is your sister a freak?

39:00.404 --> 39:03.396
Hey, come here.
Hey, sit down.

39:06.977 --> 39:10.071
<i>Now, I'm askin' you a question.
Is she a freak?</i>

39:10.147 --> 39:12.411
Man, you married.

39:12.483 --> 39:17.420
Hey, I know you're just a kid,
Fresh, even though you're smart.

39:17.488 --> 39:20.924
So I let you talk to me
like that just this one time.

39:20.991 --> 39:24.586
But you tell me- You better
tell me who she's runnin' with.

39:24.662 --> 39:27.597
- Nobody.
- Don't fuck with me, little homie!

39:27.665 --> 39:30.691
Serious, my aunt won't
let her out with nobody.

39:30.768 --> 39:33.032
You know,
I find that hard to believe.

39:33.104 --> 39:36.505
Bitch as fine as that.
She always has somebody.

39:36.574 --> 39:40.032
Word, but my aunt won't
let her out with nobody.

39:40.111 --> 39:44.411
I hope you're right, little homie.
I hope you're right.

39:58.796 --> 40:02.732
<i>Okay, come on, Let's go,</i>

40:04.969 --> 40:07.904
I gotta see Nichole.

40:07.972 --> 40:10.907
Yeah?
Who the fuck are you?

40:10.975 --> 40:14.069
Her brother.
I gotta see her.

40:17.648 --> 40:21.084
I got a kid down here
say he Nichole's brother.

40:21.152 --> 40:25.248
Send him up.
- One flight up.

40:25.322 --> 40:29.019
Use the stairway at the back of
the store. There's only one door.

40:31.929 --> 40:35.057
So, you Michael.

40:39.170 --> 40:42.765
I guess you used up
all the ugly in the family.

40:44.508 --> 40:47.773
Keep hearin' you the little man
runnin' the street.

40:47.845 --> 40:51.508
You the little man
runnin' the street?

40:51.582 --> 40:55.416
Shit, next thing I know
niggers in diapers...

40:55.486 --> 40:59.616
packin' tech-nines be tryin'
to take over my business.

41:01.859 --> 41:05.795
I said put me down!
Put me down!

41:05.863 --> 41:08.627
She's in there.

41:08.699 --> 41:11.600
Esteban looking for you.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.463
Good for Esteban.

41:16.807 --> 41:19.173
Yo, why you stay with James?

41:26.750 --> 41:28.741
You know why, Fresh.

41:28.819 --> 41:31.583
Why?

41:33.791 --> 41:37.318
'Cause his smack is the dope
and he got plenty of it.

41:37.394 --> 41:40.158
<i>You happy now?</i>

41:40.231 --> 41:42.392
Why you don't go
to Esteban, then?

41:48.739 --> 41:51.003
I don't like the way
he looks at me.

41:53.377 --> 41:58.314
<i>I don't need no spic pimp motherfucker
lookin' at me like I'm no fucking queen.</i>

42:02.486 --> 42:05.478
I'm just a sorry-ass
nigger ho'.

42:05.556 --> 42:10.619
<i>James here, he looks at me like
I'm nothing, so I'm down withJames,</i>

42:10.694 --> 42:12.321
You ain't
ain't nothin'.

42:14.698 --> 42:20.068
Michael, fuck off,

42:20.137 --> 42:23.903
Don't Aunt Francis think you ain't
nothin'. She think you somethin'.

42:23.974 --> 42:27.432
Aunt Francis
is a fuckin' saint.

42:30.447 --> 42:35.646
Aunt Francis loves every damn dog in
the street the same as she loves me.

42:35.719 --> 42:39.052
Ain't no shit to be loved
by no fuckin' saint.

42:41.859 --> 42:43.793
I love you.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.365

Yo, Fresh, other court's open.
