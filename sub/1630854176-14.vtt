<i>Moore built another portal.</i>

00:13.304 --> 00:15.348
- The truth is, the closer
we get to going home,

00:15.390 --> 00:17.058
the more I'm not sure
it's what I want.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.184
- I need to tell you something.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.394
But maybe now's
not a good time.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.062
I don't know how to be a mom.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.188
- The first thing
about being a mom

00:22.230 --> 00:23.398
is knowing if you are one.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.192
- Why haven't you made
up with Riley yet?

00:26.234 --> 00:28.611
You need to fix things now.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.948

You guys OK?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.040

We do that, he bleeds out.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.056
We've gotta staunch
the bleeding.

push me out of the
way of that thing?

01:00.852 --> 01:03.772

01:09.361 --> 01:11.363
I think there's
something out there.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.766
- What do you want?

01:39.808 --> 01:41.351
- To use that portal.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.395
We are going there now.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.105
- That's not gonna happen.

- No.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.289
You're gonna get us home.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.293
Having James is
a blessing in disguise.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.795
I don't know about you,

02:08.837 --> 02:11.715

about how to operate a portal.

we take him off this thing?

02:18.722 --> 02:20.515
- Minutes, maybe.

02:22.058 --> 02:24.310
- Don't worry about helping me.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.854
You gotta get
the kids out of here.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.993
- Maybe we can do both.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.536
- What do you mean?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.496
- If we can use the machine
to get to the future,

02:43.538 --> 02:45.123
why can't we use it
to get to the past?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.332
I can go back, I can warn you,

02:46.374 --> 02:47.625

will have happened.

You have the chance

02:49.085 --> 02:50.754

you've gotta take it.

you back four hours.

Josh can stay here with Dad

03:32.170 --> 03:33.505

03:34.798 --> 03:37.050

03:37.092 --> 03:38.718
we have to send
the others back to our time.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.804

[machine whirring]

03:44.933 --> 03:47.644

go to one place at a time.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.896
If you redirect the portal
once they go through,

03:49.938 --> 03:53.400
Eve and Izzy will have
no way to get back.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.734

03:55.902 --> 03:57.570
I have a responsibility

be a whole other story.

I remember seeing
it from this angle.

It was a few miles
before the campsite

05:43.343 --> 05:44.928

05:44.969 --> 05:47.055
So we can get back to
the campsite and warn Dad.

We gotta keep him as
comfortable as we can.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.578
- Dad, can we please
talk about it?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.205
- There's nothing
to talk about.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.790
I get why you backed Eve.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.083
All we can do is move forward.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.584
- That's not what I meant.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.878
You and Mom were
getting divorced.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.007
You knew this the whole time.
You didn't say anything.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.925
Why?

06:23.967 --> 06:25.135
- 'Cause you're my kid.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.053
You don't need to
know about that.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.473

At least, I thought we were.

fighting to go home to.

But I had to be
honest with myself.

wrong with me and your mom,

06:53.288 --> 06:55.331

was kidding myself.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.110
my folks sent me away
to my cousin's farm,

08:47.152 --> 08:49.863
so I got to know horses.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.406

You get pretty good

I just could never
wrangle them.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.656
- So what happens now? Ah!

11:38.698 --> 11:40.575
- James, stop!

11:40.617 --> 11:42.786
[grunting]

11:43.912 --> 11:45.163
- Please, James!

11:52.962 --> 11:54.089
You all right?
Let me help you.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.132
- Ow. I'm OK, I'm OK.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.842
It must have just grazed me.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.595
- Here.
Let's wrap it up.

12:00.637 --> 12:03.098
- Mom, we have to go warn Dad.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.724
- What do you mean?

12:06.476 --> 12:07.936
- This is gonna be
a lot for you to process.

12:07.977 --> 12:12.023
<i>* *</i>

12:12.065 --> 12:15.652
- This is probably the last
candy bar in 10,000 BC.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.957
[sighs] Here.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.626
Listen, I need to talk
to you about something.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.714
I've been trying to open
this damn thing, and I can't.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.507
It has some kind of
locking mechanism.

12:37.549 --> 12:40.969
And I was hoping, because I
found it next to your teddy,

12:41.011 --> 12:42.637
maybe you might--

12:48.393 --> 12:50.353
[lock clicks]

12:52.897 --> 12:54.607
Petra!
Nice work!

12:58.236 --> 12:59.571
Wait.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.323
I know that woman.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.908
That's Maya Schmidt.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.201
I was supposed to have
a job interview with her,

13:05.243 --> 13:07.370
the day the sinkhole opened up.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.414
Is that your--

13:10.373 --> 13:12.459
Petra, you can tell me.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.588
<i>- Mutter.</i>

13:16.629 --> 13:18.757
- Mother?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.175
She's your mom?

13:20.216 --> 13:21.843
OK. Uh, where is she?

13:21.885 --> 13:24.179
Is she here?

13:24.220 --> 13:26.222
[speaking German]

13:27.891 --> 13:29.559
This is freaking bananas.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.561
I mean, this can't just
be a coincidence, can it?

13:31.603 --> 13:33.521
Gosh, I wish it was
easier to talk to her.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.732
I used to be so good at German.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.026
How do I help her?
What do I say?

13:38.068 --> 13:41.863
- [wheezing, coughing]

13:41.905 --> 13:43.615
- Petra?

13:45.241 --> 13:48.036
[speaking German]

13:48.078 --> 13:49.746
Is it asthma?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.209
Do you need an inhaler?

13:54.250 --> 13:56.419
Uh, one of these?

13:58.755 --> 14:00.965
That inhaler
at the campsite was yours.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.384
OK. We need to get it.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.511
Come on.
Let's go find it.

14:15.855 --> 14:19.109
- I need you to tell me exactly
what's wrong with the portal.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.236
- No pleasantries.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.737
No time for poignancy.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.781
- No, I just need you to tell
me how to fix the machine.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.282
- I understand.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.036
The cooling system's
malfunctioning.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.830
Those pipes inside the room--
you'll notice there's

14:31.871 --> 14:33.581
no running water
going through them.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.417
That's why the device
is overheating.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.502
And my guess,
we only have a few hours

14:37.544 --> 14:41.131
before it fails completely
and traps all of us here.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.258
- I need you to fix it.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.094
- Why would I want to do that?

14:46.136 --> 14:47.971
- [clears throat]

14:48.013 --> 14:51.266
When we met at Lazarus,

14:51.307 --> 14:54.519
you said to me

14:54.561 --> 14:59.107
you wanted to make amends
for your mistakes,

14:59.149 --> 15:02.235
that you'd grown as a person,

15:02.277 --> 15:04.946
and you wanted a second chance.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.698
This is it.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.827
I need my father.

15:14.414 --> 15:20.337
My fate, and the fate of my
family, rests in your hands.

15:20.378 --> 15:23.465
- If you want me
to fix the portal,

15:23.506 --> 15:26.426
I need these restraints removed

15:26.468 --> 15:29.304
and guaranteed access
to the machine.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.805
- So you can do what?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.474
- So I can go back
to where I'm from

15:32.515 --> 15:34.809
and restart
the Lazarus Project.

15:34.851 --> 15:38.021
And unless those demands
are met, I do nothing.

15:38.063 --> 15:44.527
- Even now, all you care
about is your own agenda.

15:44.569 --> 15:50.617
I'm your son,

15:50.658 --> 15:55.663
and I'm dying in front of you.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.791
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

15:58.833 --> 16:03.463
- I lost my son years ago.

16:03.505 --> 16:07.717
If you want my help,
you have my terms.

16:27.028 --> 16:27.237
.

16:27.278 --> 16:28.238
- This is it.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.159
I know you looked at me
like I was crazy

16:33.201 --> 16:34.661
when I said
I wanted to stay here.

16:34.703 --> 16:35.995
- Because it is crazy.

16:36.037 --> 16:38.581
- Maybe. But parents
raised kids in 10,000 BC,

16:38.623 --> 16:40.166
and way before then.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.293
People adapt to the
conditions that they're in.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.463
- This isn't some
off-the-grid farm.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.884
I know you're scared of going
back to the guy you were,

16:49.926 --> 16:51.761
but you turned
your life around.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.055
You have strength.
That doesn't just go away.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.182
- I'm, like, a week into
walking a new path.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.851
I could get lost tomorrow.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.061
- But you won't,

17:00.103 --> 17:02.147
because we have each other.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.275
- Or I drag you down with me

17:05.316 --> 17:06.651
and worse,
an innocent little kid.

17:09.988 --> 17:14.284
I will get you home.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.578
But I'm staying here.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.208
- Are you sure we're
going the right way?

17:22.250 --> 17:23.335
I feel like we've
come this way before.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.086
- There's a shortcut
up this way

17:25.128 --> 17:26.296
through a mountain pass.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.256
Paara has been
teaching me the land.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.675
I promise, we'll have you
with Gavin in no time.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.185
- I appreciate you
letting me come with you.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.481
- Despite everything, I still
care about you, Levi.

17:44.522 --> 17:49.152
When we get home, I just
want us all to start over.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.821
- Starting over isn't
so simple for me, Izz.

17:51.863 --> 17:53.281
- Why not?

17:55.367 --> 17:56.910
- There are things
that I was involved in

17:56.951 --> 17:59.204
that I can't run away from.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.667
To get back down here,
I had to cross

18:03.708 --> 18:05.251
some powerful people.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.505
- Which people, Levi?

18:11.633 --> 18:13.259
- Let's just try
to stay focused

18:13.301 --> 18:14.761
on what's in front of us.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.850
- James said
it's only a few hours

18:20.892 --> 18:22.268
until the machine breaks down.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.145
- If that aurora
goes out, Mom and Izz

18:24.187 --> 18:25.355
will never get back to us.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.148
We'll be stuck
down here forever.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.608
- James might be a maniac,

18:28.650 --> 18:30.235
but he's the only one who
knows how to fix this machine.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.529
We need him.
- Nah, maybe not.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.198
He told me the problem is
with the cooling system.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.701
There's not enough water
flowing into the machine.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.120
- So maybe there's something
wrong with the water source.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.038
- There's a maze of
tunnels down here.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.623
How are we gonna find that?

18:43.665 --> 18:45.667
- Hold on, hold on.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.294
I think I saw a spring
outside the cave.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.255
- Sounds like
a water source to me.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.216
- Judah, go check it out.
- Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.634
- And take them, too.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.428
- Guys, we got
an important job.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.138
I need you both.
Come on.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.806
Let's go.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.224
- You should stay.
I'll go with Judah.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.393
- Wha--
Veronica--

19:07.272 --> 19:09.149
- Mom, look!

19:15.280 --> 19:16.906
- Is that the aurora
you came through?

19:16.948 --> 19:19.534
- Yeah.
But it was bigger.

19:19.576 --> 19:22.078
- God, if this thing closes,
how are we gonna get back?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.413
- You two should go now.

19:23.455 --> 19:25.165
This might be your only
chance to get home.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.291
- No.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.418
I'm not abandoning Gavin.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.878
We're gonna finish
what we started.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.793

20:09.834 --> 20:12.170
I'm sorry.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.339
- Me too.

20:14.381 --> 20:19.761
- I got scared,
and so I shut down.

20:19.803 --> 20:22.931

about you, but I can't.

24:58.373 --> 25:00.041
What are you doing here?

25:00.083 --> 25:01.835
- Thinking.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.253
- Not exactly the best time
for that.

25:07.257 --> 25:10.093
Gavin...

25:10.135 --> 25:11.761
he's gone.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.017
- I'm sorry, man.

25:17.058 --> 25:18.435
- But still,
everything can change

25:18.476 --> 25:20.937
as long as Eve and Izzy finish
what they set out to do.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.231
But we have to keep that portal
open, so they can get back.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.066
I need you to help me
figure out why water's

25:25.108 --> 25:26.985
not flowing to that machine.
- No, hey, hey.

25:27.027 --> 25:28.528
Honestly, Sam, I kinda
ruin everything I touch.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.488
So maybe it's best I don't
go anywhere near the thing

25:30.530 --> 25:31.990
that might get everyone home.

25:32.032 --> 25:33.992
- What's with the woe is me?

25:35.243 --> 25:36.745
- Veronica's pregnant.

25:39.664 --> 25:41.583
- Huh.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.714
And since you had
a dad that messed you up,

25:47.756 --> 25:50.675
you think you'll
do the same to your kid.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.010
So why bother?

25:52.052 --> 25:55.013
Better to not try,
so no one gets hurt.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.931
- I don't need
this from you, OK?

25:56.973 --> 25:58.433

25:58.475 --> 26:01.061
I may be the only guy
you do need this from.

26:01.102 --> 26:07.108
Because you and me, our dads
both did a number on us.

26:07.150 --> 26:11.780
But sometimes, the apple
does fall far from the tree.

26:11.821 --> 26:16.284

26:16.326 --> 26:18.244
I'm a good dad.

26:18.286 --> 26:21.039
You think about yourself
a certain way, right?

26:21.081 --> 26:23.792
And it's hard to
break out from that.

26:23.833 --> 26:27.420

change is possible--

26:27.462 --> 26:29.631

26:42.977 --> 26:44.729
- How can you be sure?

26:45.980 --> 26:47.065
- Because the map
is still here.

26:47.107 --> 26:48.608
So we'll just wait for him.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.776

- All right. What do we do?

27:04.290 --> 27:05.667
- Leave him a note.
Warn him that way.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.127

he'll find it?

it on the map.

What happened?

[booming]

39:24.656 --> 39:26.825
- Look at these dates.

39:26.866 --> 39:28.535
They're all over the place.

39:28.576 --> 39:29.953
Who knows where the portal
is gonna send us?

Go.

Come on, go!

39:42.882 --> 39:44.175
Mom.

39:46.094 --> 39:47.595
- Whoa, whoa, wait up.

39:47.637 --> 39:49.931
We need Moore's journal
if we're gonna fix the machine.

39:49.973 --> 39:53.184

40:16.875 --> 40:17.917

40:17.959 --> 40:19.294
- Here, take this and go.

We're not leaving!

We found each other once,
we can do it again.

- Mom, no!

41:21.940 --> 41:24.067
We can't use the portal.

41:24.109 --> 41:26.111
We have no way to get to Mom.

41:26.152 --> 41:28.488
- We find the others,
we get to the clearing,

41:28.530 --> 41:29.739

a lizard that big.

- What could have made that?

41:40.792 --> 41:42.168
- I have no idea.
