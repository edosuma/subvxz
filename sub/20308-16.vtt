WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:04.879
(siren wails)

00:09.175 --> 00:11.594
(indistinct chattering)

00:11.678 --> 00:13.013
MAN: I don't want anybody in here.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.100
Yes, Captain.

00:17.183 --> 00:20.895
One male infant, two female minors,
about a 30-year-old male and female,

00:20.979 --> 00:21.980
and an elderly couple.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.565
-All in the same room?
-They're all over the house.

00:23.648 --> 00:24.941
Hell shot out of the place.

00:25.483 --> 00:26.901
(chatter on radio)

00:28.069 --> 00:28.903
Neighbor called it in.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.989
Didn't see any faces,
but he's sure it was gangs.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.699
This is Captain Furillo.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.618
I wish I had seen
what happened better, Captain.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.787
I understand.
We appreciate your calling it in.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.165
MAN: This is a terrible thing.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.459
This is a good, Christian family.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.171
I-I don't know why those
gang boys would bother them.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.088
You're sure it was gangs.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.716
Oh, I-I seen the outfits they was wearing.

00:49.799 --> 00:50.925
Two of them coming out.

00:51.676 --> 00:55.013
That's a family inside.
That's seven lives gone.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.681
You want night shift
to stay on this, Captain?

00:58.600 --> 00:59.601
We'll take care of it.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.936
(helicopter whirs)

01:04.314 --> 01:07.400
(all yelling)

01:08.610 --> 01:09.778
What is it? What do you want?

01:09.861 --> 01:11.863
For you to make a mistake would be nice.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.240
All right, do you see this?
This is a search warrant.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.576
We're looking for weapons
or any kind of evidence

01:16.659 --> 01:19.162
connected with the crime at 133 Timpkin.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.373
-Hey, hey, toss the place.
-The drawer's empty.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.585
-I said toss the freakin' place!
-(clattering)

01:26.377 --> 01:29.005
All right, now we're gonna talk.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.383
Item the last, people,
a cautionary from Division.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.386
It seems that some bunco players
have come into possession

01:35.470 --> 01:38.223
of the membership rolls
of the policemen's auxiliary,

01:38.723 --> 01:41.267
and they're peddling
bogus discount packets

01:41.351 --> 01:45.522
for Hawaiian vacations,
lest our spouses be gulled.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.983
Um... and that's it.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.194
Let's have a safe shift.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.116
Thanks, Sarge.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.368
-(coughs)
-Robert.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.995
Uh, Sarge, about Andy's and my assignment.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.123
I was wondering if maybe
we could do follow-up

02:03.206 --> 02:04.707
on the Timpkin Street shootings.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.709
Oh, I understand the impulse, Robert,

02:06.793 --> 02:09.379
but we're responsible
to the entire precinct.

02:09.462 --> 02:10.380
What's this?

02:10.463 --> 02:13.967
Um, I was just trying to get us reassigned
to the Timpkin Street shootings.

02:14.050 --> 02:17.387
Yeah. If Officer Hill don't mind,
I'd just as soon do our routine patrol.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.097
-Sector four?
-Yeah, section four.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.557
That's what you assigned us, right?
We were sitting right there.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.392
-You said, "sector four."
-That's right.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.935
That's right. Okay, let's do it.

02:25.103 --> 02:28.106
SI's 30% completed on the house.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.607
No usable prints as of yet.

02:29.691 --> 02:33.653
We have one witness.
He saw Blood colors, no faces.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.613
Nothing on a warrant search
of Blood headquarters

02:35.697 --> 02:38.074
or a site interrogation
of the gang members.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.744
So we're conducting a door-to-door canvas
for possible further witnesses.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.079
In other words, we're no place.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.540
"The Massacre of the Innocents."

02:45.623 --> 02:47.292
You know, I don't think
that's incendiary, Frank.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.085
I think that's exactly
what the public feels.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.880
Henry, don't we have charges
pending against Alfred Williams?

02:51.963 --> 02:52.839
FLETCHER: Who's Alfred Williams?

02:52.922 --> 02:56.092
I just popped him on a stolen-check beef.
He's a gang kid?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.178
He's 80% out.
I've been working on getting him out.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.222
Suppose we deal down his charges
in order to get his cooperation.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.392
Look, I've got $2,800 left
for witness compensation.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.145
All of it is available for a bust in this.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.355
I just don't want to spend
the next two weeks

03:09.439 --> 03:11.566
watching them
recycle this headline, Frank.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.819
(door slams)

03:14.903 --> 03:16.029
Give me a sec with the captain, Norm.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.532
Yeah.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.371
I worked two years with that kid, Frank.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.414
He's charged with a felony.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.749
He says he's innocent.

03:27.832 --> 03:30.251
Henry, I have seven people killed
and not that much of a lead.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.879
Maybe Williams can give us some evidence.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.591
Let's let him decide
whether or not he wants to cooperate.

03:37.008 --> 03:41.054
Norman. Will you work with Henry
on this deal down?

03:41.971 --> 03:43.723
Sure thing, Captain.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.602
You don't trust me
to carry out your orders?

03:47.685 --> 03:51.147
Detective Buntz was the arresting officer
on the stolen-check charge.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.910
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:03.993 --> 04:05.703
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:05.787 --> 04:09.540
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:09.624 --> 04:11.251
(sirens wailing)

04:17.006 --> 04:20.009
(theme music playing)

05:55.271 --> 05:58.191
I think Delacroce has only one "L."

05:58.274 --> 06:01.444
All right, let me see
if we got to redo the warrant.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.281
-"Aloha" is the island greeting.
-Aloha.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.033
-Undercover with Belker, huh?
-Yep.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.035
-See how quick I figured that out?
-(laughs)

06:09.118 --> 06:11.287
I'll make detective myself one day,
am I right?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.164
-(sniffs)
-What's up?

06:14.374 --> 06:16.584
Oh, yeah, I know-- I know
we can't say anything like that...

06:16.667 --> 06:20.630
that, uh-- that we're seeing each other,
but I just wanted you to know, uh...

06:21.839 --> 06:24.217
-You know I dig you.
-Patrick...

06:24.634 --> 06:26.135
-Right.
-Cool it.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.345
No, you're right. You're right.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.764
Hey! Check out the new bantam bake.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.682
-Come on.
-Yeah.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.519
(indistinct chattering)

06:34.602 --> 06:37.939
What you're looking at
is heat sensitized and voice activated.

06:38.856 --> 06:39.774
You with me?

06:39.857 --> 06:41.776
-Heat-sensitize selects the category.
-(beeps)

06:41.859 --> 06:43.653
Just put your hand
on the picture of the food,

06:43.736 --> 06:46.114
as in pastry, sandwich, fruit, whatever,

06:46.197 --> 06:48.866
and your particular selection
is voice activated,

06:48.950 --> 06:49.951
-as in "donut."
-(beeps)

06:51.994 --> 06:53.246
(swooshes)

06:53.329 --> 06:55.706
Ah! (laughs)
That's marvelous!

06:55.790 --> 06:57.417
-May I?
-Yeah.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.962
Of course, Why they put a state-of-the-art
machine in a battle zone

07:01.045 --> 07:03.089
is something you have to ask
my superiors about.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.799
Pearls before swine, Irv.

07:04.882 --> 07:08.428
All right, now, I put my money in,
and I-I've selected my product area.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.387
-Pastry, right?
-Yeah.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.680
Now just tell it what you want.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.224
-Please give me a donut.
-No, no.

07:13.307 --> 07:16.018
You don't have to be polite.
It only hears the one key word.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.228
(swooshing)

07:17.311 --> 07:19.272
(chuckling) Hey, look at that!

07:19.355 --> 07:22.191
Gee, that really is a modern miracle, Irv.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.985
Yeah. Rube Goldberg's got the patent.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.654
Heat-sensitize, and you voice-activate.

07:26.737 --> 07:29.031
It's-it's kind of like
watching an elephant pick up a pea.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.117
Yeah. I expect sarcasm from you, LaRue.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.994
-This thing got Twinkies?
-Yeah.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.997
Just put your hand
on the category. Pastry.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.165
I've only got two quarters.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.207
Go ahead. It'll make the change.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.210
-Now say what you want.
-(beeps)

07:41.294 --> 07:42.128
Twinkies.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.631
(swooshing)

07:45.715 --> 07:47.717
Whoa! Jackpot!

07:48.843 --> 07:50.344
Winner! Winner! Whoa!

07:55.224 --> 07:57.727
You guys see what I'm seeing?
Machine's fallen in love.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.061
-(laughs)
-Yeah, if I didn't know any better,

07:59.145 --> 08:00.396
I'd offer it a cigarette.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.523
-MAN: Yeah.
-Anybody want a Twinkie?

08:05.109 --> 08:07.653
(indistinct chattering)

08:07.737 --> 08:08.905
(machine beeps)

08:08.988 --> 08:11.282
Now she'll act like
she doesn't know you from Adam.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.162
Okay, okay, what's bugging you?

08:16.245 --> 08:17.121
You should have consulted me.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.625
You don't volunteer us for duty
without consultation.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.586
You're right. You're right.
I-I apologize.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.005
We do not go looking for trouble,
Bobby Hill,

08:26.088 --> 08:27.673
and if you don't understand that on a day

08:27.757 --> 08:30.301
when seven people get killed
sleeping in their own beds,

08:30.384 --> 08:32.345
I don't know how to begin
to explain it to you.

08:33.137 --> 08:35.640
Maybe what if it had been
Daryl Ann and the baby?

08:35.723 --> 08:36.933
Yeah, exactly.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.979
Let's see what's happening
with this methadone clinic.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.940
-I hate this job.
-(tires screech)

08:49.070 --> 08:49.987
Hey!

08:50.947 --> 08:52.615
-Hey, hey, hey.
-(clamoring)

08:52.698 --> 08:54.909
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold it!

08:54.992 --> 08:57.495
-The both of you!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:57.578 --> 09:00.456
-Now, what is going on? Now, what?
-Nothing!

09:01.457 --> 09:03.292
You. You... (indistinct)

09:04.001 --> 09:06.921
-Why is this big guy hitting on you?
-'Cause he's a jerk, man!

09:07.004 --> 09:09.507
'Cause he and the guy he works for,
he's selfish!

09:10.591 --> 09:12.218
(crying) Oh, jeez!

09:12.760 --> 09:14.428
(whimpers) Look at this here.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.598
I hope you're happy with yourself, Jaden!

09:17.682 --> 09:19.767
-You don't pay for it, you don't use it.
-(chuckles)

09:20.518 --> 09:22.186
All right, let's go, gentlemen.
Time to make your deposits.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.854
-MAN: All right.
-Come on.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.359
Got something to do
with the methadone clinic?

09:28.442 --> 09:30.528
Got something to do
with people being selfish.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.572
Ones who don't trust other people
one day to the next!

09:32.655 --> 09:34.448
-Shut up!
-Don't touch him!

09:35.157 --> 09:37.034
Hey, you! Yeah, you!

09:37.285 --> 09:38.995
(yelling indistinct)
You selfish man!

09:39.078 --> 09:41.038
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Me?

09:41.122 --> 09:42.915
-You! Up against the alley wall!
-(groans)

09:44.750 --> 09:46.085
-Come on.
-MAN: Where we going?

09:46.168 --> 09:48.129
We're going to find out
what's going on here.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.424
What is that in there?

09:52.216 --> 09:53.801
What you want with me, man?
I didn't do nothing!

09:53.884 --> 09:56.637
Reach in your pocket with your right hand.
Let me see your ID right now.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.848
RENKO: Lean up against the wall right here
and spread them now.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.602
See? This is what you get
for being greedy, man!

10:02.685 --> 10:05.521
This is what you get for not showing
a little generousness.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.522
Shut up!

10:08.649 --> 10:12.903
You know, this is a familiar odor
that I am trying not to place.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.864
WOMAN: Yeah, he's the one! He did it!

10:14.947 --> 10:18.242
He sells them filthy stuff!
I'm sick of it!

10:19.160 --> 10:20.703
Do you know what this is, Bobby?

10:21.370 --> 10:23.956
You know what product
I think this merchant is dealing in?

10:24.498 --> 10:26.250
-What?
-WOMAN: Can you see where he hides it?

10:26.334 --> 10:28.002
He hides it up here!

10:28.085 --> 10:31.047
The pig! And I am sick of it!

10:31.130 --> 10:33.299
Please, ma'am, don't do...

10:33.924 --> 10:35.384
-That.
-MAN: Nice shot!

10:35.468 --> 10:36.969
Oh, cowboy.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.348
-MAN: Hey, man!
-(MEN LAUGHING)

10:43.768 --> 10:47.647
I kept telling myself, "He's street level.
You've already got him on multiple sells."

10:47.730 --> 10:51.442
But then he'd start to hit me again
with this success rap,

10:51.525 --> 10:54.362
"I'm on my way up.
We're gonna do pounds."

10:54.612 --> 10:57.239
So I tell myself, "See where it goes."

10:57.323 --> 10:58.824
Well, you got to trust that.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.703
-Check this out.
-"Make a million before you're 40."

11:03.120 --> 11:03.954
He gave you this?

11:04.872 --> 11:07.249
-Hi, Ronnie.
-What is it? What's good?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.335
How you doing? Ronnie. What's going on?

11:09.418 --> 11:12.838
Check this. Listen to this.
Are you ready to get dragged?

11:13.005 --> 11:15.424
I am not in position.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.384
Why not?

11:16.467 --> 11:17.593
My people stalled on me.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.428
I can't get situated till two o'clock.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.098
Which she will tell you, man.
This is not how I want to do things.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.642
You see. I say,
"Acropolis Coffee, 9:00 a.m."

11:24.725 --> 11:25.935
Ba-bing, I want to show up.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.104
Ba-boom, you got your package, I got mine.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.189
Ba-bang, we check it out, we do our thing.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.566
Next day, we're back on the street
before 9:01.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.026
-Ronnie--
-You read that book I gave you?

11:34.110 --> 11:36.696
-Yep.
-You read that chapter with promptness?

11:36.779 --> 11:39.615
Promptness buys credibility.
Credibility buys trust.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.033
-BELKER: Ronnie.
-Yeah?

11:41.117 --> 11:43.953
Will you have the product
you told her about at two o'clock?

11:44.578 --> 11:46.038
-What's your name?
-Mick.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.456
I'm going to be here.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.209
I'm going to be holding, as advertised.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.627
-Good.
-You want to know another thing?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.421
You're never going to have to tell me
your name again.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.048
See? 'Cause remember names,
remember faces.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.009
-They'll remember you. Mick!
-Two o'clock.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.556
What do you think?

12:04.348 --> 12:05.516
I think he gave me a headache.

12:05.766 --> 12:06.976
Thanks, Mr. Rollins.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.606
-You amaze me, Neal.
-How's that, lover?

12:12.690 --> 12:16.152
They tell us, "We don't know squat.
We didn't hear anything last night."

12:16.235 --> 12:18.779
And you still stand there,
and you take down their names.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.823
Well, the book says take names, lover.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.993
(sighs) Hey, where's it say in the book
that we do a house-to-house

12:24.076 --> 12:26.704
over 800 yards
from where the family got killed?

12:26.787 --> 12:29.123
I think the captain's
getting carried away on this.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.708
Well, this is the last one, lover.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.628
-(foreign accent) Police officers?
-Yes, ma'am.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.839
You were at Louise Leonard's house
a few minutes ago.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.340
She just called me on the telephone.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.341
Small world.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.845
Ma'am, uh, seven people were killed
a few blocks from here last night.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.890
We were wondering if you saw or heard
anything around 2:00 a.m.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.142
-Yes, I did.
-Uh-huh.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.352
-What did you see, ma'am?
-Plenty.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.397
But before I cooperate,

12:53.481 --> 12:56.066
you have to recover something
very valuable for me.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.485
What's your name, lady?

12:58.068 --> 12:59.069
Doris Breyfogle.

12:59.153 --> 13:03.240
Mrs. Breyfogle,
this ain't exactly a barter situation.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.034
NEAL: What was taken, ma'am?

13:05.451 --> 13:07.077
My husband's reindeer sweater.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.913
Oh, for cryin' out loud!

13:08.996 --> 13:13.000
The thief is not further than 50 feet away
from where we're standing.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.377
And I know right
where he has got it hidden.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.590
Neal, you see the Coke bottles
this old broad's using for glasses?

13:19.882 --> 13:23.677
She probably looks in the mirror
then dials 911 to report an intruder.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.222
Uh, ma'am, uh,
we get you your sweater back,

13:26.305 --> 13:27.890
you going to tell us what it was you saw?

13:27.973 --> 13:29.099
Absolutely!

13:29.725 --> 13:32.394
Last house, J.D. We got nothing to lose.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.107
He's right over there.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.443
I don't know, Neal.
The sinister sweater thief.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.945
You think we should call for backup?

13:41.028 --> 13:42.029
NEAL: You sure that's him, ma'am?

13:42.112 --> 13:44.323
Yes. The brazen, little greaser.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.200
Check out that pompadour.

13:46.283 --> 13:49.203
Worse comes to worse, we can bust him
for building without a permit.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.455
It's over there, right over there!

13:51.539 --> 13:52.665
-You see?
-Hey!

13:54.124 --> 13:55.125
What's going on?

13:55.584 --> 13:57.670
-Lady says you took her sweater.
-(scoffs)

13:58.128 --> 13:59.922
Lady's got her head in a wedge.

14:00.631 --> 14:01.841
Hey, look in here, J.D.

14:01.924 --> 14:02.800
-Dude's a gardener.
-Uh-oh.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.803
Hey, now, personal use,
a medical necessity.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.722
Now what am I supposed to do
when my cataracts act up?

14:09.723 --> 14:11.225
This is your lucky day, pal.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.810
We got what we were looking for.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.854
You can go back to melanoma land.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.983
-(sighs)
-Thank you. I'm so grateful!

14:20.609 --> 14:21.861
Your turn, ma'am.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.487
Excuse me?

14:24.154 --> 14:27.616
It's your turn, ma'am, to tell us
what it was you saw last night.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.369
About those seven people
getting killed. Remember?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.496
I'm sorry. I fibbed.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.664
I knew it.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.250
I acted like I didn't know it,
but I knew it.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.210
Ma'am, you didn't see anything?

14:39.420 --> 14:42.423
I slept through last night.
I didn't wake up once.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.924
It's really not like me.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.843
I got to take an early retirement.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.680
You should never do this, ma'am,
lying to the police.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.766
I think it's terrible what happened
to those poor people.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.102
I'm going to stay up all night tonight.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.729
I'm going to help. You'll see.

14:56.812 --> 15:00.691
Neal, why don't you get me out of here
with what's still left of my mind?

15:08.657 --> 15:11.827
You can have your lawyer here
if you want, Alfred.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.165
-No, it's okay.
-Correct answer number one.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.002
We think the Blood were involved

15:20.085 --> 15:22.212
in the killings on Timpkin Street
this morning.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.465
(scoffs) Well, I don't know
nothing about that.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.841
But you're friends with Carl Mann.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.470
-So what, I keep tabs--
-So Carl Mann is the head of the Blood.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.138
Come on, kid, don't be stupid.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.516
We want you to wear a wire.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.436
-Try to get Mann to talk about what--
-Oh, no. No, no, no.

15:37.519 --> 15:41.148
Hey, hey. You are staring a felony pop
for that check thing, Alfred.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.359
I wouldn't start shaking my head so soon.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.156
Alfred, how much money you save

15:49.239 --> 15:50.783
toward art school
in the eight months you been out?

15:51.617 --> 15:56.705
Don't save much... behind minimum wage,
working two jobs or not.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.748
Well, it's your choice.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.334
I'm not telling you what to do.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.380
But you could get a deal down
on the bad-check arrest

16:04.797 --> 16:07.675
and witness payment,
as much as $2,000.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.134
Get your life started.

16:09.426 --> 16:12.805
You know what happens
if Carl figures out what I'm doing?

16:12.888 --> 16:15.683
Nobody pays you two grand
for picking up soap, Alfred.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.602
It is your decision.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.271
I didn't steal that check!

16:21.772 --> 16:25.192
(coughs)

16:26.443 --> 16:30.990
This is what being my friend
has all been about,

16:31.991 --> 16:34.201
setting me up for the snitch.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.160
-No.
-Hmm.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.329
Hey, kid, a skip off the bad paper

16:37.413 --> 16:40.040
and dough to go to art school
and stare at naked women,

16:40.124 --> 16:42.876
all you should be asking is,
"When's the bus leave?"

16:48.674 --> 16:51.301
-(chuckles) Okay.
-Okay.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.597
I'll do it.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.350
There. And the duck comes down.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.435
(laughs)

17:03.063 --> 17:04.023
(door closes)

17:07.651 --> 17:08.527
(brakes squeal)

17:14.908 --> 17:17.494
-Feeling better this morning?
-Feeling better how?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.622
Remember last night,
we were talking about seeing a movie,

17:20.706 --> 17:22.374
and you said you weren't feeling so hot?

17:22.666 --> 17:25.002
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel fine today.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.634
Wow, what's the problem, Goldstein?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.678
Piece is worth at least 200 in hock.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.431
Help you, officers?

17:37.639 --> 17:40.267
Oh, mind if I finish my business first?

17:42.102 --> 17:43.479
Okay, okay, then sell it, okay?

17:43.562 --> 17:45.522
I know it's worth two yards south.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.566
Can you prove ownership of this?

17:47.649 --> 17:48.776
I mean, you got a receipt
or something, sir?

17:48.859 --> 17:51.570
Why-why should I keep a receipt?
It was a gift.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.614
Wha... What is this, huh?

17:53.697 --> 17:55.032
We had a 911 complaint.

17:55.115 --> 17:59.078
Somebody fitting your description
selling stolen jewelry at this store.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.915
Oh, yeah? Hmm. Okay.

18:04.666 --> 18:05.626
Yeah, I get it.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.377
I know what she's doing.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.131
Your three balls out front?
I hope they rot and fall off.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.466
-Hold on.
-Hey, hey!

18:12.549 --> 18:13.926
Hey, I earned this, okay?

18:14.718 --> 18:16.428
I already put my time in for this.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.597
What do you say
we figure this out down the station?

18:18.680 --> 18:19.973
Straighten it all out.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.392
-Put the other nail in, Sylvia.
-Take it easy--

18:22.476 --> 18:23.852
Come on, Sylvia, finish me off!

18:23.936 --> 18:27.397
Hey, I don't know who Sylvia is,
but you better calm down!

18:28.023 --> 18:30.150
-Hey.
-Where you rushing to, Neal?

18:30.234 --> 18:32.736
Captain's just going to tell us
to widen perimeter.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.154
Fix your wonder machine, Irv?

18:34.238 --> 18:35.739
Ho, ho, ho.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.491
Just a minor adjustment problem, Sergeant.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.868
-Hmm.
-Trip wire for the pastry category

18:39.952 --> 18:41.495
was too audio sensitive.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.372
Come on, honey.

18:43.455 --> 18:48.460
You give up a ham-and-cheese sandwich,
and Tawny's going to be real nice to you.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.171
Would you please curb
your lascivious display, madam.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.215
That machine requires currency.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.092
Ain't what I heard.

18:55.551 --> 19:00.013
Heard you talk dirty,
and this here will turn itself inside out.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.057
Ah-- Calm yourself, Irving.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.434
This place doesn't deserve
a machine like this.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.646
It started with the silver,
then the Ming vase.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.858
Now every time I'm gone 20 minutes,
he's taking, he's hocking.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.026
We'll put it all
on a complaint form, ma'am.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.570
Yeah, well, you know.
It's not the stealing.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.738
I mean, it's the insults!

19:16.822 --> 19:18.157
I don't have to take that from any man.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.992
I'm still an attractive girl.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.745
-There he is...
-There he is.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.833
You have to do that?
Have him in with criminals?

19:27.916 --> 19:30.210
You charged him with theft, ma'am.
That's a crime.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.714
I'm just wondering
if maybe I did the right thing.

19:34.965 --> 19:35.883
I mean, look at him.

19:37.759 --> 19:41.180
His Spanish eyes, hair of a poet...

19:41.847 --> 19:42.848
No hips.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.602
You know what it's like when a man
with no hips tells you he loves you?

19:46.685 --> 19:48.145
Not for anything, ma'am.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.898
-That brooch you said was worth a grand?
-More.

19:50.981 --> 19:54.276
Well, "No Hips" was letting it go
for a quick deuce when we picked him up.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.111
-Now it's up to you.
-Sylvia!

19:57.613 --> 19:58.906
My bird of paradise.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.200
Don't you "paradise" me.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.618
-Is this the complainant?
-She's not sure.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.702
She's thinking maybe
she won't press charges

20:03.785 --> 20:05.245
-on account of his hair--
-Look at me. Look.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.247
Look what they're doing to your peacock.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.291
LUCY: So what is it? We got charges?

20:11.752 --> 20:14.546
You treated me
like a piece of bruised fruit.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.090
I-I was lonely for you. I was hurt.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.675
You didn't take me.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.802
You said you didn't want
to go to my sister's.

20:21.511 --> 20:24.306
-Ramon Mendez?
-Miss Davenport, you may not be needed.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.601
Miss Selsen's deciding
whether she's going to press charges.

20:27.684 --> 20:31.063
Oh... you know,
the stealing I don't mind, right?

20:31.146 --> 20:33.941
Because Mr. Selsen, thank God,
left me with a lot of money.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.735
But he brings other girls to the apartment
when I'm not there.

20:36.818 --> 20:40.030
Ma'am, all we really need to know
is whether you're gonna press charges.

20:40.113 --> 20:40.989
Darling?

20:42.783 --> 20:45.994
-Charge him... for his own good.
-You dried-up hag!

20:48.330 --> 20:49.706
Shall we, Mr. Mendez?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.000
-Neal, J.D.
-Captain.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.169
Nothing on house-to-house
on the Timpkin Street killing, Captain.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.128
Oh, wait a second, Neal.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.590
We did help that old lady
get her husband's reindeer sweater back.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.592
Lieutenant Goldblume
get the kid to cooperate?

21:00.676 --> 21:03.053
He'll be wearing a wire,
try to incriminate Carl Mann.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.722
Seems like our best bet.
You want us to stay on house-to-house?

21:05.806 --> 21:08.141
-Let's widen the perimeter.
-I'm shocked.

21:08.892 --> 21:13.397
I am something she keeps in a cage,
like a Chihuahua, like a goldfish.

21:13.480 --> 21:17.067
Goldfish don't get charged with
grand larceny, Mr. Mendez.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.402
I'm choking. (chokes)

21:19.403 --> 21:20.487
She suffocated me.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.992
To me, I deserved anything
I could lay my hands on. No question.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.077
In other words, you did commit the crime.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.662
(clears throat)

21:29.830 --> 21:32.708
Technically, yes, I stole.

21:33.542 --> 21:38.046
(sighs) I probably can get reduction
to misdemeanor in exchange for a plea.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.341
See, if-if you could get me
a sit-down with her.

21:41.925 --> 21:42.759
With Mrs. Selsen?

21:42.843 --> 21:44.636
Uh-huh. Can you get me a face-to-face?

21:47.431 --> 21:50.559
-Yes, there is a Santa Claus, Ramon.
-She dropped?

21:50.976 --> 21:53.687
-That's right.
-Uh, she say if I could keep the brooch?

21:56.106 --> 21:57.316
-Captain.
-Howard.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.610
Rank review panel's getting together
materials for your appeal hearing.

22:01.945 --> 22:02.904
Oh, I see.

22:03.238 --> 22:06.325
Uh, well, I'm submitting my files,

22:06.408 --> 22:08.410
but, uh, I thought you might want
to look them over

22:08.910 --> 22:09.995
before I turn them in.

22:10.078 --> 22:14.458
Uh... No. No, thank you very much.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.086
You-you wouldn't take this as a--
as a bad sign, would you, Frank?

22:18.462 --> 22:20.380
I think asking for the files
is pretty standard.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.050
Well, I hope these people understand

22:23.133 --> 22:24.718
that they're dealing with
people's lives here.

22:25.135 --> 22:28.305
I mean, I'm not... some puppet on a string

22:28.388 --> 22:31.516
to have hopes
jerked back and forth like Pinocchio.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.809
I think they understand that.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.145
Well, first they said they would
hear my appeal, and then--

22:35.437 --> 22:37.522
Howard, they have to ask for the files.

22:37.731 --> 22:38.940
They have to know what the case is about.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.152
I suppose.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.155
-What's the date of the hearing?
-23rd, week from Monday.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.825
I know how hard this is,
but try to put it out of your mind.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.410
No, no, that's the way I'm doing it.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.746
(inhales) Nice and easy does it.

22:54.956 --> 22:59.378
The only area that I've been feeling
some strains is in the equatorial regions.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.546
Sorry?

23:02.172 --> 23:06.051
Oh, for the past week or so,
I've-I've been somewhat irregular.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.845
Usually, you can set your watch
by my peristaltic process.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.723
But not to worry.
I'm going to start pushing fibers.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.480
I thank you for the, uh, one-on-one.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.023
Anytime, Howard.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.409
Well, I've had everything else
happen to me.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.119
I suppose it's only a matter of time

23:32.202 --> 23:34.913
before I had a bottle of urine
dumped on my head.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.373
Shirt's clean.

23:36.456 --> 23:41.253
Yeah. Put 50 cents in the washing machine
to watch the clothes go around 500 times.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.672
-Now, look at this...
-(horn honks)

23:43.755 --> 23:45.257
I lost a button, too.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.343
-Get out of the street, lady.
-(horn honks)

23:50.512 --> 23:51.388
(tires screech)

23:52.431 --> 23:57.352
(speaking Spanish)

23:57.436 --> 23:59.187
She's afraid. What-what's the matter?

23:59.271 --> 24:01.022
-Where is he, ma'am?
-(speaking in Spanish)

24:01.106 --> 24:03.275
-Where, ma'am?
-(speaking in Spanish)

24:04.317 --> 24:05.819
Show us! Show us! Come on!

24:05.902 --> 24:07.487
(woman crying)

24:07.571 --> 24:09.531
-(speaking in Spanish)
-Oh, my Lord.

24:09.614 --> 24:10.824
Roll him over, Renko.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.785
(groans) Smells like
he drank himself to death.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.245
He's not breathing, but he's got a pulse.

24:15.328 --> 24:17.372
Ma'am, was he eating?
Did he have anything--

24:17.456 --> 24:20.333
(speaking in Spanish)

24:20.417 --> 24:22.252
I think he's got his air passage blocked.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.422
Now, ma'am, what we're doing here
is called the Heimlich maneuver.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.466
-(vomits)
-Papa!

24:28.508 --> 24:30.886
-(retching)
-Ah, papa!

24:31.344 --> 24:34.181
(speaking Spanish)

24:39.311 --> 24:40.270
What are you talking about?

24:40.353 --> 24:43.523
She said, "Take off your shirt."
She'll wash it for you. (chuckles)

24:45.859 --> 24:48.445
What did my shirt do
to deserve something like this?

24:48.528 --> 24:52.365
-Ah! (groaning)
-Ma'am! Ma'am, are you all right?

24:52.782 --> 24:54.576
-How-how far along are you, ma'am?
-(screams)

24:54.659 --> 24:56.036
Hey, hey, missus...

24:57.162 --> 24:58.955
Renko, do you know
what's going to happen, Renko?

24:59.039 --> 25:02.876
-No, I do not!
-(woman screams)

25:04.002 --> 25:07.047
Do you think this woman
is about to have her baby now?

25:07.923 --> 25:09.633
(indistinct talking on radio)

25:09.716 --> 25:12.886
How strong was your case against Williams
on that stolen check charge, Norm?

25:14.513 --> 25:15.430
Pretty strong.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.059
Any chance he was telling the truth,
he found the check in the hallway?

25:21.561 --> 25:24.231
Kid didn't seem too worked up
about missing his day in court.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.193
(static crackles)

25:28.276 --> 25:29.653
MANN (on radio): <i>What's going on?</i>

25:29.736 --> 25:31.404
WILLIAMS (on radio) : <i>Heard about</i>
<i>what happened this morning.</i>

25:31.863 --> 25:32.781
What's that?

25:32.948 --> 25:35.116
Heard a whole family got took down.

25:35.283 --> 25:36.576
Wasn't any of us, was it?

25:36.660 --> 25:38.995
-Say what?
-Wasn't any of the Bloods?

25:39.621 --> 25:41.289
Man, I ain't got rings in anybody's noses.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.667
-I don't know everything people do.
-I bet.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.545
You see me behind the door of your room
when you're doing your drawing?

25:46.628 --> 25:48.630
Uh-uh. Right. I got you.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.131
Why you asking me about that for?

25:50.215 --> 25:52.842
I ain't asking. I'm saying,
wasn't any of the Bloods involved.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.970
What you looking at me like that for?

25:56.596 --> 25:58.598
How's that bad check thing going, Freddy?

25:59.182 --> 26:00.267
Didn't get to court yet.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.518
You trying to get some help?

26:01.601 --> 26:02.644
You trying to take
something to the police?

26:02.727 --> 26:03.562
He's in trouble.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.814
WILLIAMS: <i>Oh, chill out. I don't know</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

26:05.897 --> 26:06.940
MANN: <i>I got to go.</i>

26:07.023 --> 26:08.984
-Where you going?
-Just back off me, Freddy.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.194
I'm going, and you don't
want to know where.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.698
Aw, damn.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.117
-What?
-What? He made him.

26:17.450 --> 26:18.410
Carl Mann made Williams.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.871
No, he's-he's thinking about it.

26:23.039 --> 26:24.124
He don't know what he made.

26:30.171 --> 26:31.381
(cash register dings)

26:40.098 --> 26:41.891
People I was supposed to cop from
let me down.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.476
You don't know the scrambling I had to do.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.187
Ronnie, you have what
you were supposed to bring?

26:46.563 --> 26:48.398
Mick, did I say I would have it?

26:48.481 --> 26:51.109
-This isn't Echo Canyon, Ronnie.
-The answer's yes.

26:51.192 --> 26:52.527
Do you have what you
were supposed to bring?

26:52.611 --> 26:55.238
-MICK: Yes.
-Then everything is everything.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.448
Could I take a little peek?

26:56.531 --> 26:58.617
(chuckles) I was about to ask you
the same thing.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.456
It was all worth it, wasn't it?

27:04.873 --> 27:07.375
The trust, the give and the take,
the going the extra yard.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.170
Ronnie, you're under arrest.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.714
If this is a joke, it's in horrible taste.

27:12.797 --> 27:13.882
It's not a joke.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.010
-If it's not a joke--
-It's not a joke! You're under arrest.

27:17.344 --> 27:20.096
I know you're saying this now,
but I'm saying if it was...

27:21.598 --> 27:22.557
I'm sick.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.060
(sighs) I'm gonna pass out.

27:25.518 --> 27:26.603
Let's go, Ronnie.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.774
Twenty-two degrees, I'm completely
soaked through. Look at this.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.567
Okay, okay, I'm dealing with the now.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.818
I'm dealing with the present.

27:34.277 --> 27:35.779
I got something to trade. I got plenty!

27:35.862 --> 27:37.614
-At the station house.
-You think I'm jiving.

27:37.697 --> 27:39.532
Believe me.
I'm going to turn this thing around.

27:40.075 --> 27:45.288
-(speaking Spanish)
-(panting)

27:45.372 --> 27:46.623
Equipment.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.875
(speaking Spanish)

27:48.958 --> 27:50.669
<i>Por favor,</i> no hospital.

27:50.752 --> 27:51.920
<i>No, no, hospital.</i>

27:52.003 --> 27:53.505
-They're afraid.
-Why?

27:53.588 --> 27:54.964
-They're <i>majados.</i>
-What's that mean?

27:55.048 --> 27:57.676
-No green card. They'll be deported.
-No such thing is going to happen.

27:57.759 --> 28:01.638
So tell her that we are not Immigrations,
but we're not doctors, either.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.391
-(speaking Spanish)
-(screams)

28:04.474 --> 28:05.684
Bobby, Bobby!

28:05.767 --> 28:08.019
I'm afraid that
that is academic right now.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.646
-So, uh, go to plan "B."
-All right.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.981
Ma'am! Ma'am, look at me! Look at me.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.233
(speaking Spanish)

28:13.316 --> 28:14.484
Call me Dr. Renko,

28:14.567 --> 28:17.278
and when I say, "push,"
I want you to push.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.488
(overlapping dialogue)

28:19.280 --> 28:22.158
(grunting)

28:28.039 --> 28:30.625
Mr. Delacroce has been given
his Miranda rights.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.627
Specifically, he has declined
the right to counsel.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.546
-Correct.
-It is understood that if the information

28:34.629 --> 28:37.424
Mr. Delacroce provides
is substantive and productive,

28:37.507 --> 28:39.509
the district attorney's office
will give consideration

28:39.592 --> 28:42.137
in pursuit of outstanding charges
against Mr. Delacroce.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.098
Go ahead.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.978
Two kids, Shaky and Dumar,
they're moving me an eighth of a key.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.021
I was supposed to pick it up
at 4:30 this morning.

28:52.522 --> 28:55.191
I go there 4:30.
They're not in position, okay?

28:55.275 --> 28:56.359
Someone took them off.

28:56.609 --> 28:57.777
They say, "Come back at 8:00."

28:58.403 --> 29:00.321
They know who did it.
They're going out to get it back.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.199
(clears throat) Eight o'clock,
I go back there.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.244
They're crying.
They're all covered with blood.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.037
They went to the wrong place.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.083
When they went to get their stuff back,
the address they had was wrong.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.086
And they kept going from room to room

29:15.170 --> 29:17.380
because they thought they'd find
the kids that took them off.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.716
But it was the wrong house.

29:19.799 --> 29:22.385
Shaky and Dumar, they're Blood?

29:22.844 --> 29:24.929
-Gang kids, right.
-Any other gang members involved?

29:25.013 --> 29:27.015
These kids were freelancing.
They're looking to step up.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.099
Where do they live?

29:29.058 --> 29:30.435
They got a room together, 180 Foreman.

29:30.518 --> 29:32.520
But you'll find them
at the gang headquarters.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.567
(clears throat) Believe me, I was sick
when I heard what they did.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.694
-(door closes)
-Was that good enough?

29:40.403 --> 29:41.821
Is your office
going to give consideration?

29:41.905 --> 29:43.698
You'll be the first to know,
Mr. Delacroce.

29:44.991 --> 29:48.870
The bargain,
fair exchange of value on both sides.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.711
She asked for us by name?

29:57.212 --> 29:59.923
Yeah, maybe she's looking you over
as a replacement for Ramon, huh.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.801
Oh, that's funny, real funny. Mrs. Selsen?

30:04.469 --> 30:06.137
Open up, it's the police.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.181
-(easy-listening music plays)
-(lock opens)

30:11.142 --> 30:12.101
Mrs. Selsen?

30:15.939 --> 30:18.566
(laughing) Me and Ramon!

30:18.650 --> 30:20.401
Trouble in paradise.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.362
Mrs. Selsen, you want him arrested?

30:22.987 --> 30:25.448
The peacock? He could drop dead.

30:26.324 --> 30:29.244
(voice breaking)
I don't want him arrested.

30:29.869 --> 30:30.954
Then why'd you call us?

30:31.412 --> 30:35.500
Well... I'm a practical girl.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.753
I mean, God gave me a tush and no brains.

30:39.128 --> 30:43.007
So I found Mr. Selsen. God rest his soul.

30:44.008 --> 30:48.638
And I gave him three good years
before he passed away on that couch.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.601
And then-- And then Ramon came,

30:53.685 --> 30:57.146
and he took from me,
and he used me, and...

30:57.856 --> 31:00.441
but he can't do that anymore
because... (crying)

31:00.733 --> 31:02.610
-LUCY: Mrs. Selsen?
-(crying) I'm still a good-looking...

31:02.694 --> 31:03.736
You okay?

31:04.237 --> 31:06.406
I hate that skinny creep!

31:10.118 --> 31:11.911
-I hate...
-Sarge, look.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.038
Yeah. Did you take,
Mrs. Selsen, all of them?

31:14.122 --> 31:16.332
(wailing)

31:17.208 --> 31:19.294
Come on, let's keep you on your feet.
Keep walking.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.087
This is Officer Flaherty.

31:21.170 --> 31:25.341
We need an ambulance,
1804 Hancock. Penthouse.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.301
Immediately.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.386
HARRY: It's your choice, Alfred.

31:28.845 --> 31:31.055
You can call it off.
You don't have to talk to him again.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.933
Yeah. And if you do, kid,
the next thing you ought to think about

31:34.017 --> 31:36.477
is when's your trial date
on that stolen check beef?

31:36.561 --> 31:37.395
Hey.

31:39.981 --> 31:43.568
-Do you think he made me?
-Not sure, but that's possible.

31:44.652 --> 31:45.737
Judgment call, kid.

31:46.738 --> 31:47.906
One thing I do know,

31:48.823 --> 31:51.576
you learn every time at bat
on something like this.

31:51.659 --> 31:54.871
Next time you, uh, talk to him,
your moves are going to be a lot better.

31:54.954 --> 31:55.955
-What's going on?
-(cars approaching)

31:58.541 --> 31:59.584
(tires screech)

32:00.043 --> 32:01.586
What's going on?

32:05.465 --> 32:08.259
-(clamoring)
-(loud music playing)

32:09.385 --> 32:11.346
Okay, Jack, you're busted! Come on!

32:12.055 --> 32:14.933
-Okay, there's Dumar. There!
-(overlapping conversations)

32:15.016 --> 32:16.309
-Next to him, next to him!
-(growls)

32:16.392 --> 32:19.187
-All right, all right.
-Don't even think about it!

32:20.772 --> 32:21.648
HARRY: You recognize them?

32:22.523 --> 32:25.568
One of them is Tony Soames.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.821
-"Shaky."
-(car engine starts)

32:29.197 --> 32:30.531
I can't make out the other.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.868
Oh, he looks like Dumar.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.871
But I'm not sure of his last name.

32:36.955 --> 32:37.914
-Get the precinct?
-Yeah.

32:37.997 --> 32:40.333
They're busting two kids
on the Timpkin Street murders.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.753
-I thought you said it was Carl!
-HARRY: What about Carl Mann?

32:43.836 --> 32:45.672
(sniffs) No, Hunter said
it was just them two.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.090
Come on, let's go.

32:47.173 --> 32:48.925
How's it feel to be yesterday's news, kid?

32:49.008 --> 32:51.803
(siren wails)

32:53.304 --> 32:54.263
(NORMAN clears throat)

33:02.522 --> 33:04.190
This is a treatment area, sir.

33:04.273 --> 33:05.650
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

33:05.733 --> 33:08.152
WOMAN (over PA):
<i>Dr. Cole, Dr. Joshua Cole,</i>

33:08.236 --> 33:09.654
<i>to intensive-care unit number nine.</i>

33:09.737 --> 33:12.323
-LUCY: Look who's here.
-Worried about your meal ticket, Ramon?

33:12.407 --> 33:14.867
-What happened?
-She took sleeping pills.

33:14.951 --> 33:16.703
I knew it. I knew it. Stupid!

33:16.786 --> 33:19.622
Ask me, what's stupid is worrying
about a drip like you.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.249
That's 'cause
you don't know my good side.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.500
She okay?

33:22.583 --> 33:24.419
I'm admitting her.
She's got some kidney problems.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.962
I want to follow her overnight.

33:26.045 --> 33:28.131
-Sylvia!
-Let her be, Ramon, huh?

33:28.381 --> 33:31.009
(weakly) Ah, look who's here.

33:31.467 --> 33:34.846
Julio Iglesias. (snorts)

33:34.929 --> 33:35.763
I love you.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.017
Come on, don't-don't leave me.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.894
Talk to my kidneys.

33:45.898 --> 33:48.943
-(elevator dings)
-I love you! <i>Te amo!</i>

33:50.611 --> 33:52.155
WOMAN (over PA): <i>Nurses' station seven.</i>

33:53.990 --> 33:55.825
<i>Nurses' station seven.</i>

33:56.242 --> 33:58.036
You-you think I don't love her.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.123
Yeah, well, I-I could be over
to her apartment right now.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.375
I could be cleaning that place out.

34:05.918 --> 34:06.836
Let's go.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.632
Yeah, you go, you go.

34:11.716 --> 34:12.759
I'll stay right here.

34:13.843 --> 34:17.472
Stay right here till...
she's out of the woods.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.516
Okay, woman, now you got to push.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.060
-(panting, groaning)
-(speaks in Spanish)

34:22.143 --> 34:24.145
RENKO: Take it easy now.
Okay, now, what I want...

34:24.228 --> 34:26.230
-(woman groans)
-(translator talking in Spanish)

34:26.314 --> 34:29.984
Okay, now push. Push now.
Right now. You're almost home.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.653
You're almost--
You're coming around home now.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.155
You're coming around home. Take it easy.

34:34.238 --> 34:36.532
-(grunting)
-(overlapping voices)

34:37.200 --> 34:38.242
-Bobby, I can see the head.
-(woman screaming)

34:38.326 --> 34:39.577
Now if I pull it around her,
I get the shoulder.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.412
-You need some help?
-Uh-uh.

34:41.496 --> 34:44.290
You did all the help you can
just pulling the car over.

34:44.373 --> 34:45.750
Okay. Push!

34:45.833 --> 34:48.544
(screams)

34:48.628 --> 34:50.505
Oh! Oh, my God.

34:50.588 --> 34:53.633
(baby cries)

34:53.716 --> 34:55.384
-BOBBY: Oh, look at that!
-(laughs)

34:55.468 --> 34:56.928
BOBBY: Oh, man!

34:57.011 --> 34:58.054
Way to go, Doc!

34:58.137 --> 35:00.848
(wailing)

35:04.852 --> 35:07.605
SID reports three usable prints
at the murder house, Frank,

35:07.688 --> 35:09.732
and those two gentlemen are going away.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.318
FLETCHER: Frank! Where are your people?

35:12.985 --> 35:14.612
Belker, Russo.

35:15.363 --> 35:19.242
Arrest within 14 hours, that's the kind
of police work we're capable of.

35:19.742 --> 35:21.452
Same-day service, huh, people?

35:22.328 --> 35:24.247
-Damn fine job!
-Thank you.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.373
HARRY: I want to talk to him.

35:25.665 --> 35:28.709
Officer Russo, understand you,
uh, baited the original operation.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.671
-She wasn't bait.
-I made the original buys, yes.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.965
Perp probably never knew
what hit him, huh?

35:34.757 --> 35:36.717
And this guy ramrodded
for you, right, Frank?

35:36.801 --> 35:39.387
With Lieutenant Buntz. Could I talk to you
for a minute in my office?

35:39.470 --> 35:40.638
I haven't got time right now, compadre.

35:40.721 --> 35:42.974
I'll tell you the truth.
When I came in this morning,

35:43.057 --> 35:46.519
I wanted to give my TV guy
a shot in the chops.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.105
We are staring at unsolved
multiple homicides,

35:49.188 --> 35:50.398
and he books me on <i>Hot Seat.</i>

35:50.481 --> 35:53.860
But you people got me off the hook!
You did me proud.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.112
See you later, Frank.
Keep up the good work.

35:56.946 --> 35:59.157
I want witness compensation
for Alfred Williams.

36:00.908 --> 36:01.993
Did you hear me?

36:02.368 --> 36:05.580
Henry, this bust came off
Belker and Russo's turning a drug dealer.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.248
-(door slams)
-That's not Alfred Williams' fault.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.249
It isn't his fault.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.419
But the fact is,
his cooperation didn't buy this bust,

36:11.502 --> 36:13.087
Which is how compensation gets decided.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.005
This is great.

36:14.088 --> 36:15.464
That kid's walking around
with a target on his back--

36:15.548 --> 36:16.549
You sure he was made?

36:16.841 --> 36:18.843
I was there. I monitored the conversation.

36:18.926 --> 36:21.095
Rather than asking for compensation,
I think I have a better chance--

36:21.179 --> 36:23.097
I don't give a damn
what bureaucratic cubbyhole--

36:23.181 --> 36:26.809
Look! Let me see if I can get him
some money. I'll let you know.

36:35.735 --> 36:36.652
Okay, what?

36:37.028 --> 36:39.447
-Sylvia.
-What about her?

36:39.530 --> 36:42.408
The look in her eyes when the doctor said
she was gonna make it.

36:42.491 --> 36:43.910
Like she was disappointed.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.455
But you know she's going to be back
with Ramon in no time flat.

36:48.289 --> 36:51.167
Well, you know something?
Ramon is her jones.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.544
I mean, as your idol
Mr. Sinatra might say,

36:53.628 --> 36:54.921
"Whatever gets you
through the night." Huh?

36:56.672 --> 36:57.757
Patrick.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.176
What? You getting that feeling
like you had last night, huh?

37:00.259 --> 37:02.595
-You got a headache?
-A headache? No.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.473
Good. Because nobody was gonna ask you

37:05.556 --> 37:07.642
to go to the movies
or nothing drastic like that.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.477
-Look, Lucy--
-You look yourself.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.856
I want to be your friend,
and I think I am your friend.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.817
So when I say, "Are you okay?
Does your head hurt?"

37:16.901 --> 37:19.820
It just means, "Are you okay?"

37:19.987 --> 37:22.615
It's no come-on.
It's no Dance of the Seven Veils.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.075
-All right?
-All right.

37:26.285 --> 37:27.453
So are you okay?

37:27.536 --> 37:29.205
-I'm okay. Yeah.
-You're okay.

37:29.288 --> 37:30.456
-Thanks.
-Okay.

37:31.916 --> 37:32.917
Thank you, Lucy.

37:33.834 --> 37:35.461
(telephone rings)

37:40.716 --> 37:42.551
(machine beeps)

37:42.927 --> 37:44.303
Chicken-noodle soup.

37:53.145 --> 37:56.232
(humming)

38:09.412 --> 38:12.331
Oh, man! She killed it, lover.

38:12.748 --> 38:14.041
At least it died happy.

38:15.334 --> 38:16.419
(coughs)

38:18.045 --> 38:18.879
What do <i>you</i> want?

38:20.715 --> 38:21.632
We have to talk.

38:22.091 --> 38:25.094
This is great. This is perfect.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.637
Did you knock on all the doors?

38:26.887 --> 38:28.973
Did you show everyone your badge?

38:37.231 --> 38:40.318
You got some nerve coming in here
after what you did to me.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.447
-No argument.
-Of course, you're a cop, right?

38:45.031 --> 38:47.575
You can do anything you want.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.412
I wouldn't really expect you
to feel any different.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.498
But what you think about me
really doesn't matter anymore, Alfred.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.043
The only thing that matters

38:57.835 --> 38:59.712
is that you not let this ruin
the rest of your life.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.672
I think you all
did a pretty good job of that.

39:01.756 --> 39:05.259
Do you know what Carl Mann's
gonna think happened?

39:05.509 --> 39:07.762
-Hell, everybody in the gang will think...
-I know.

39:07.845 --> 39:10.848
...I gave up Shaky and Dumar
and even gave up Carl.

39:11.432 --> 39:12.641
Here's $200.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.852
And I'll send you more when I can.

39:15.686 --> 39:18.606
-I want you to get out of town.
-(scoffs) What you talking about, man?

39:19.857 --> 39:21.108
You must be ailing.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.197
Maybe the department doing this to you
can be, uh, a blessing in disguise.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.865
Maybe it can be a way
to make a fresh start.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.701
(laughs) Man, you make me laugh.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.747
Want me to get out of town.

39:34.830 --> 39:36.582
Go to art school somewhere.

39:36.665 --> 39:38.876
Listen to me, man. Just listen to me!

39:39.251 --> 39:41.379
When I got into Warren Design,

39:43.214 --> 39:47.468
I sat outside that damn school
nine straight days.

39:48.135 --> 39:50.721
I rode the bus downtown, and I sat there.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.349
And then turned around, rode back up here

39:53.432 --> 39:56.394
until I got the nerve to fill out
that damn application!

39:56.477 --> 39:59.522
I'm a street kid, Mr. Cop,
and you come here,

39:59.605 --> 40:02.108
and you talk about
pick up and move somewhere

40:02.191 --> 40:05.194
and go to school someplace
I ain't never been.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.405
-Don't do anything stupid, Alfred.
-I know what--

40:07.488 --> 40:09.532
Don't do anything stupid
that will finish your chances for--

40:09.615 --> 40:12.034
No, you finished my chances, Mr. Cop!

40:12.118 --> 40:14.078
I got to do something
about saving my life!

40:14.161 --> 40:15.496
-Alfred!
-No!

40:18.290 --> 40:21.043
Look... (breathes heavily)

40:21.919 --> 40:23.087
Just get out of here, all right?

40:27.466 --> 40:28.926
Do I still have that much say?

40:29.718 --> 40:34.598
That I can ask you to get out of my house?

40:44.817 --> 40:45.985
I apologize.

40:47.319 --> 40:49.905
Yeah? (scoffs)

40:54.535 --> 40:55.828
-You know, I didn't even have lunch...
-(sighs)

40:55.911 --> 40:57.663
...and the shift is almost over?

40:58.205 --> 40:59.206
Shirt okay?

41:00.249 --> 41:02.501
-My shirt is shrunk.
-(laughs)

41:03.961 --> 41:07.131
Did you see her look at me
when she came out?

41:07.590 --> 41:09.425
-Did you see?
-Yeah, I saw.

41:09.508 --> 41:11.218
(laughs) Did you see the look on her face?

41:11.719 --> 41:13.429
They all look like Peter Lorre,
don't they?

41:13.512 --> 41:15.014
(laughing) Yes!

41:15.097 --> 41:16.182
MAN: Excuse me.

41:16.932 --> 41:19.268
I'm Rosita's husband, Hector Esposito.

41:19.351 --> 41:21.854
Oh, yeah, Hector. Please, join us.

41:21.937 --> 41:24.607
Congratulations, amigo.
You got a beautiful little girl.

41:24.690 --> 41:25.524
Thank you.

41:26.442 --> 41:29.069
-I saw your car.
-(chuckles) Glad you found us.

41:29.612 --> 41:33.199
These are for you. Gracias. Thank you.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.408
<i>Por nada.</i>

41:36.160 --> 41:38.120
-Look at this. Look at this!
-Oh!

41:38.204 --> 41:40.456
For what my father-in-law
did to your shirts.

41:40.539 --> 41:42.917
Food! Frittos. That's perfect.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.794
My wife, she thanks you also.

41:46.253 --> 41:47.880
She wishes to know your name.

41:48.714 --> 41:51.800
Uh, Andrew J. Renko. Why?

41:53.302 --> 41:55.387
She wishes to name
our baby girl after you.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.014
(laughs)

41:57.097 --> 42:00.226
-She wants to name the baby Andrew?
-Oh... (laughs)

42:01.435 --> 42:02.937
You could name her Andrea.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.648
-Andrea?
-Yeah.

42:06.315 --> 42:08.108
Andrea Esposito!

42:08.859 --> 42:10.444
We will never forget you.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.570
Gracias, señor.

42:12.446 --> 42:13.572
Thank you, Andrew.

42:14.865 --> 42:17.993
Andrea! Andrea Esposito!

42:19.662 --> 42:22.039
Now, you still hate the job?

42:22.122 --> 42:23.999
(laughs)

42:27.878 --> 42:30.881
-You're putting me on.
-No.

42:31.757 --> 42:34.593
-You offered the kid 200 bucks?
-That's right.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.805
(laughs) You want me to leave town
somewhere, Lieutenant?

42:37.888 --> 42:39.139
-Leave it alone, Norm.
-(laughs)

42:40.182 --> 42:44.270
Okay, so, uh, the problem is
maybe Alfred's gang pals

42:44.353 --> 42:46.689
are gonna hurt him
now that he's a known snitch, right?

42:46.939 --> 42:51.569
So a couple days from now, we grab Alfred,
we kick him around a little bit in public.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.113
Rehabilitate his reputation
with the street creeps.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.365
-What could be simpler. Right, Norm?
-Hmm.

42:56.448 --> 42:59.535
To cover our butts, we take a kid
who almost made it to the straight side,

43:00.327 --> 43:01.412
drive him back into the street.

43:01.495 --> 43:04.832
Lieutenant, the kid was
hanging bad paper last week.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.917
Let's not put him up there
with Mother Teresa.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.420
-Henry, Norm.
-What's doing, Captain?

43:09.503 --> 43:10.588
I went to Daniels.

43:11.714 --> 43:14.967
He'll give Alfred Williams
250 dollars relocation money.

43:15.926 --> 43:16.802
Won't be needed.

43:17.094 --> 43:19.138
I don't think the kid's
leaving town, Captain.

43:20.889 --> 43:23.475
Alfred doesn't want to leave anymore.
Doesn't want to go to art school.

43:23.559 --> 43:27.229
Wants to stay here
and work things out with Carl Mann.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.189
And that's good for us, right, Frank?

43:30.399 --> 43:31.483
He's back on the street.

43:31.859 --> 43:35.154
We can bust him, turn him,
toss him back, turn him around again.

43:35.237 --> 43:36.238
He's ours.

43:37.364 --> 43:40.075
-Why save a kid when we can use him?
-Henry.

43:40.159 --> 43:41.827
(sighs) Take it easy, Lieutenant.
Work's over.

43:41.910 --> 43:43.996
When did you become a bottom liner, Frank?

43:44.747 --> 43:46.957
When did you stop caring about
the lives that got chewed up?

43:47.374 --> 43:48.208
I'll go in the can.

43:48.292 --> 43:49.877
Not necessary, Norm. We're through.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.338
-I'm not through.
-Well, I'm through listening, Henry.

43:53.172 --> 43:55.090
And I'm tired
of your moral finger-pointing.

43:55.758 --> 43:57.426
If this precinct doesn't run
the way you want it to,

43:57.509 --> 43:58.761
why don't you find one that does?

44:08.312 --> 44:10.564
FRANK: There was a time when something
happened in the precinct,

44:10.648 --> 44:13.108
my first instinct
was to get Henry's judgment.

44:14.526 --> 44:16.904
Now I find myself hoping
he won't be primary cop

44:16.987 --> 44:19.281
so I won't have to get him
involved in the case.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.949
Do you think he feels that?

44:22.910 --> 44:23.827
Probably.

44:26.205 --> 44:27.206
Chicken and the egg.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.583
It's not just professional disagreement.

44:31.794 --> 44:34.338
I don't know how we let ourselves
get so far apart.

44:34.630 --> 44:36.465
(sighs)

44:37.383 --> 44:39.426
A fella don't have
that many friends, Furillo.

44:42.471 --> 44:44.640
I mean, I don't think
I was wrong, necessarily.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.103
But I don't think
it was necessarily Frank's fault.

44:51.271 --> 44:53.357
He was probably doing
what he needed to make the case.

44:54.983 --> 44:58.278
(inhales) But you know,
I-I can get up there.

44:58.362 --> 45:00.155
I can get up on my high horse.

45:03.701 --> 45:04.785
Why don't you call him?

45:07.287 --> 45:08.956
-Who, Frank?
-Mm-hmm.

45:12.543 --> 45:13.419
Maybe later.

45:20.884 --> 45:22.261
This lady today, uh,

45:22.594 --> 45:24.596
-she's keeping this guy?
-Mm.

45:26.056 --> 45:27.766
And every time she walks
out the front door,

45:27.850 --> 45:31.311
this guy hocks everything
that isn't nailed down.

45:32.813 --> 45:34.148
Me and Bates popped him.

45:35.858 --> 45:37.359
And he's dead to rights.

45:38.736 --> 45:41.447
But she decides
she doesn't want to press charges.

45:43.615 --> 45:46.160
This afternoon,
she takes a whole bunch of pills.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.749
Belker and me had a wiggy guy today, too.

45:52.624 --> 45:53.542
(chuckles)

45:58.088 --> 45:58.922
What's wrong?

45:59.840 --> 46:00.758
Nothing.

46:01.508 --> 46:02.551
Did I miss something?

46:02.634 --> 46:06.221
Yeah, I was trying to tell you that
this lady couldn't keep her self-respect.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.182
I'm sorry I missed the point.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.309
You know, it's okay.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.436
Never mind.

46:17.107 --> 46:18.525
Come on, let's just do it again.

46:19.359 --> 46:22.321
Okay? All right? Is that what you want?

46:23.238 --> 46:25.073
-(wails)
-(tires screech)

46:25.157 --> 46:27.367
(indistinct chattering)

46:28.994 --> 46:31.914
(siren wails)

46:35.542 --> 46:38.253
-What happened?
-Someone shot Carl Mann.

46:38.754 --> 46:40.005
Two eyewitnesses, Captain.

46:40.297 --> 46:42.466
First time I ever heard
gang kids ready to make an ID.

46:42.883 --> 46:44.384
Alfred Williams, man.

46:44.468 --> 46:46.804
He called Carl out, then he shot him.

46:47.137 --> 46:48.013
Put out a warrant.

46:48.472 --> 46:50.015
-All right.
-Description's on file.

46:50.599 --> 46:52.768
-(indistinct talking on radio)
-(siren wails)

46:54.520 --> 46:57.940
-I'm sorry it turned out this way, Henry.
-So am I.

47:21.421 --> 47:24.424
(closing theme playing)
