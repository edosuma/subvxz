00:00.010 --> 00:01.948
ADULT ADAM: <i> Ah, the
board games of the '80s.</i>

00:01.950 --> 00:03.369
<i>Nothing bonded families faster</i>

00:03.370 --> 00:05.219
<i>than a magical night spent rolling dice</i>

00:05.220 --> 00:06.899
<i>and trapping mice with loved ones.</i>

00:06.900 --> 00:08.999
<i>No one was more into it than my mom.</i>

00:09.000 --> 00:11.261
Surprise! It's game night!

00:11.262 --> 00:12.345
- (ALL GROAN)
- That's right.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.347
I blatantly lied to your
faces to get you here.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.338
So, I'm not getting an all-expenses-paid

00:16.340 --> 00:18.620
trip to Japan to have
my own samurai sword

00:18.630 --> 00:20.299
forged from the iron of Mount Fuji?

00:20.300 --> 00:21.339
Not even a little bit.

00:21.340 --> 00:24.619
So, pint-sized comedy
genius Emmanuel Lewis

00:24.620 --> 00:26.819
isn't here to discuss future projects?

00:26.820 --> 00:29.445
You'll be the only tiny
wonder in this house.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.799
So, an A&R guy didn't reach out

00:30.800 --> 00:32.460
about a demo tape I made last year?

00:32.470 --> 00:34.460
- You're a hit with me.
- I ran here.

00:34.470 --> 00:38.371
And my high school sweetheart
didn't call, hoping to reconnect?

00:38.372 --> 00:41.416
She did call, but only to
tell you to stop calling.

00:41.417 --> 00:44.294
I'll stop calling when her
nurse stops picking up.

00:44.295 --> 00:45.713
- So, no pizza?
- Phone's right there.

00:45.714 --> 00:46.879
When will this deceit end?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.739
I just wanted one evening

00:48.740 --> 00:49.889
where we're all together

00:49.890 --> 00:52.051
in a focused seven-hour window.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.345
Seven hours? That's almost
half a night's sleep.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.449
And aren't you forgetting
we never actually play

00:56.450 --> 00:57.899
'cause we can never agree on a game?

00:57.900 --> 00:59.919
While I do agree we've
had some setbacks...

00:59.920 --> 01:01.819
POPS: Setbacks? In a fit of rage,

01:01.820 --> 01:04.059
Barry kicked the <i> Operation</i> game

01:04.060 --> 01:05.857
and needed a real operation.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.189
They sewed my toe back on,

01:07.190 --> 01:08.819
and now I have to think extra hard

01:08.820 --> 01:09.829
when I want to wiggle it.

01:09.830 --> 01:11.779
Despite Barry's zombie toe,

01:11.780 --> 01:13.479
we can still have a good night.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.139
- Who wants to play <i> Boggle?</i>
- BARRY: Pass.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.494
I used the timer as salt by mistake.

01:17.495 --> 01:20.579
Here's an oldie but a goodie.
<i>Tiddlywinks.</i>

01:20.580 --> 01:22.009
"Tiddly-winks"?

01:22.010 --> 01:23.539
Tell me more about this arousing game.

01:23.540 --> 01:25.579
Well, you use a big disc

01:25.580 --> 01:28.249
to get a little disc into a medium cup.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.579
Oh, I've been betrayed again.

01:29.580 --> 01:31.999
Just call it "Disc-cup"
so I know it sucks!

01:32.000 --> 01:33.343
<i>The Game of Life?</i>

01:33.344 --> 01:34.428
I've already played it.

01:34.429 --> 01:36.819
Turns out, there are no winners.

01:36.820 --> 01:39.719
- You'll see.
- I'm calling it. TV wins.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.959
- You can't just leave.
- I'm up already. Eh.

01:41.960 --> 01:44.353
Me, too. I'm gonna use my
"get out of hell free" card.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.699
- Same.
- <i>Tiddlywinks?</i>

01:45.700 --> 01:48.379
- This is all your fault.
- On the bright side, Bevy,

01:48.380 --> 01:50.399
we were all together for a little while.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.439
- Three minutes.
- Oy. Man, it dragged.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.599
(SIGHS) What do ya say, Bar?

01:55.600 --> 01:58.368
How about a heady game of
<i>Stratego</i> with your mama?

01:58.369 --> 02:00.286
That's so sweet you'd think
I'd do that with you.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.319
Damn it! All I wanted

02:01.320 --> 02:03.330
was one special night with my family!

02:03.332 --> 02:05.599
Here's a healthy outlet
for your anger...

02:05.600 --> 02:08.336
- Flip the board.
- Well, that doesn't sound very healthy.

02:08.338 --> 02:10.172
Do it... Or I will.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.669
Okay, loyal students,

02:31.670 --> 02:34.779
I want to tell you about a
great book I read on helium.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.072
- Couldn't put it down. (CHUCKLES)
- Was that a joke?

02:37.073 --> 02:39.479
'Cause it went over like a lead balloon.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.059
Damn it. Have I been learning stuff?

02:41.060 --> 02:43.259
If that didn't make you
laugh, neither will this...

02:43.260 --> 02:46.457
I'm assigning partners
for your midterm lab.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.459
- (STUDENTS GROAN)
- Adam Goldberg, ah,

02:48.460 --> 02:49.840
you're with Brea Bee.

02:49.850 --> 02:51.760
I be with Brea-who?

02:51.770 --> 02:53.259
ADULT ADAM: <i> But I knew
exactly who she was.</i>

02:53.260 --> 02:55.399
<i>Everyone did. She was Brea Bee,</i>

02:55.400 --> 02:57.677
<i>and she was the coolest girl in school.</i>

02:57.678 --> 02:59.220
- What's up, Adam?
- You know my name?

02:59.221 --> 03:00.479
Uh, yeah.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.265
We've been in school
together since kindergarten.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.079
For sure. The big K.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.109
Followed by "indergarten."

03:06.110 --> 03:08.099
Kindergarten, when you
put it all together.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.188
Which you already had.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.606
But, moving on...

03:10.607 --> 03:11.732
<i>Brighton Beach Memoirs.</i>

03:11.733 --> 03:13.019
It's a coming-of-age comedy

03:13.020 --> 03:14.919
about a boy with a crazy family.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.988
It checks a lot of boxes for me.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.029
I love Neil Simon.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.867
Did you know Ferris
Bueller's in <i> Biloxi Blues?</i>

03:19.868 --> 03:21.059
(STAMMERING)

03:21.060 --> 03:22.229
Oh, my God. Are you choking?

03:22.230 --> 03:24.219
You not only know who Neil Simon is,

03:24.220 --> 03:25.839
but you reference Matthew Broderick

03:25.840 --> 03:27.580
by his iconic character's name.

03:27.583 --> 03:28.708
What's the problem?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.292
The problem is you're Brea Bee.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.179
(CHUCKLING) Adam, don't be ridiculous.

03:32.180 --> 03:33.629
I'm just like everyone else.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.199
You're the most popular girl in school.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.319
That was just a unanimous
vote in the yearbook.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.109
- It means nothing.
- Even your dismissal

03:39.110 --> 03:41.039
of the high-school social
order is refreshing.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.512
Come on. We have a lab to do.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.540
Of course. How about I just do it all

03:44.550 --> 03:45.569
and we'll share the credit?

03:45.570 --> 03:46.749
- Good?
- Not good.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.228
You take all the credit and
I'll do summer school.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.529
No way, man.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.159
We're doing this together.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.289
Look, Adam, trust me,

03:53.290 --> 03:54.984
once you get to know me,
you're gonna like me.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.152
Challenge accepted.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.480
- (CHUCKLES)
- Come on.

03:57.488 --> 03:58.988
Everyone shut up.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.949
I'm pretty sure I've just
been vibing with... Brea Bee.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.139
I heard you're not supposed to tell
crazy people that they're crazy,

04:04.140 --> 04:05.279
but you're crazy.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.455
Yeah, that makes no sense.
You're wildly unappealing.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.209
I'm having a hard time
believing it, too.

04:09.210 --> 04:10.549
But there's something there.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.159
We both like Neil Simon.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.959
Everyone likes Neil Simon.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.149
He's the Brooklyn Bard.

04:15.150 --> 04:17.005
He makes your people
folksy and relatable.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.673
She's also a great person.

04:18.673 --> 04:19.940
She can't be nice and hot.

04:19.950 --> 04:21.677
No one needs two ways to get stuff.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.519
In my experience, kindness and beauty

04:23.520 --> 04:24.931
do not go hand-in-hand.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.349
- He sees me.
- You definitely read the situation wrong.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.310
There's no way Brea Bee
even knows your name.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.975
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Brea.

04:30.976 --> 04:33.599
- Holy crap!
- I know the guy who knows Brea.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.692
- I find you attractive now.
- Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:35.693 --> 04:37.619
I'm gonna go share my
lunch hour with her.

04:37.620 --> 04:40.709
Just like that? It's one
thing to vibe over chem lab.

04:40.710 --> 04:43.359
It's another thing entirely
to sit with the cool kids.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.819
ADULT ADAM: <i> Maybe, but I didn't care.</i>

04:44.820 --> 04:47.279
<i>After science class, I was flying high.</i>

04:47.280 --> 04:49.399
I'm going in.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.449
He can't just walk over there.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.039
ADULT ADAM: <i> Why not?
Who was gonna stop me?</i>

04:53.040 --> 04:54.540
Hey, you lost, bro?

04:54.550 --> 04:56.419
Yeah. That's a no-go.

04:56.420 --> 04:58.179
This is the cool table and you're...

04:58.180 --> 05:00.399
A flaming hot turd of nothing.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.419
(CRUNCH)

05:01.420 --> 05:03.629
But Brea Bee is my lab partner.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.739
- We don't make the rules.
- I mean, we do.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.019
And you could try to appeal,

05:07.020 --> 05:08.859
but I'll bury you in paperwork.

05:08.860 --> 05:10.959
She's right there. Just
let me make eye contact,

05:10.960 --> 05:13.399
- and she'll wave me in.
- Bro, stop trying to violate

05:13.400 --> 05:16.190
the well-established social
hierarchy of the cafeteria.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.879
But I'm cool... You know, in an
offbeat, non-traditional way

05:18.880 --> 05:20.449
that'll surely have more
value in adulthood.

05:20.450 --> 05:23.249
Yeah, I'm gonna dump this
dry salad on your head.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.533
It's still embarrassing,
but it cleans up easy.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.494
ADULT ADAM: <i> While the cool kids
were putting me in my place,</i>

05:27.495 --> 05:29.659
<i>Geoff and Erica were
getting cozy in theirs.</i>

05:29.660 --> 05:31.879
Molly Ringwald really is pretty in pink.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.160
Redheads traditionally can't
pull off a gentle blush,

05:34.170 --> 05:35.729
but that's how great
an actress she is...

05:35.730 --> 05:37.086
She has color range, too.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.669
Can I tell you something?

05:39.670 --> 05:41.133
I really like living with you.

05:41.134 --> 05:42.339
Aw. Me too.

05:42.340 --> 05:43.909
You know, except for
the debilitating fear

05:43.910 --> 05:45.219
of being found out by our parents.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.308
- Yeah, I'm good with it.
- What a fun and contrary view

05:47.309 --> 05:49.109
of the situation. You know
what else could be fun...

05:49.110 --> 05:51.179
- We tell them?
- Naw. This is easier.

05:51.180 --> 05:52.439
(KNOCK ON DOOR) BEVERLY: Yoo-hoo!

05:52.440 --> 05:53.477
It's your mama!

05:53.478 --> 05:55.271
Code Bev! Go, go, go!

05:55.272 --> 05:56.599
ADULT ADAM: <i> Yeah, my mom had a habit</i>

05:56.600 --> 05:58.274
<i>of dropping by the dorm unannounced.</i>

05:58.275 --> 06:00.519
<i>Luckily, Erica and Geoff
had gotten pretty good</i>

06:00.520 --> 06:02.612
<i>at making it look like
Barry still lived there.</i>

06:02.613 --> 06:03.988
BEVERLY: Hey, I heard a
new song on the radio

06:03.989 --> 06:06.491
by that man with the tushie...
Uh, Bert Springbean?

06:06.492 --> 06:08.919
So, I went to Sam Goody,
got in a fight with a man

06:08.920 --> 06:09.969
with a feather earring,

06:09.970 --> 06:11.622
and raced here with the cassingle.

06:12.430 --> 06:14.832
There's my schmoopaloopa.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.209
Where's your brother?
He's got to hear this.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.319
Yeah, he's indisposed.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.539
Hey, Barry, everything
going okay in there?

06:19.540 --> 06:21.047
BARRY'S VOICE: (FROM KEYBOARD)
<i>Hi, Mom, this isn't a good time.</i>

06:21.048 --> 06:23.609
- <i>This is Barry.</i>
- But I haven't seen you all week.

06:23.610 --> 06:26.094
Open the door and let me hold your
hand while you make poopalas.

06:26.095 --> 06:28.299
<i>Thanks for stopping by! This is Barry.</i>

06:28.300 --> 06:29.649
Yeah, it's <i> no bueno</i> in there.

06:29.650 --> 06:30.919
Let me walk you to your car.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.249
<i>Uh-oh! Barry did it again.</i>

06:33.250 --> 06:36.479
(LAUGHING) Oh! There you go, my big boy.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.889
<i>This is Barry. I'm enjoying a shower.</i>

06:38.890 --> 06:40.680
What? It doesn't sound like it.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.779
<i>Testing.</i>

06:44.780 --> 06:46.072
<i>Erica, I don't think this is working.</i>

06:46.073 --> 06:47.281
What a weird thing to say.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.699
It really is, but he's obviously
going through a lot,

06:49.700 --> 06:50.969
so let's not pull threads.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.399
Remind him to wash his bottom.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.660
ERICA: Absolutely not.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.540
ERICA: What the hell, man?

06:56.541 --> 06:58.209
You didn't have to get in the shower.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.219
I don't know!

06:59.220 --> 07:01.295
ADULT ADAM: <i> As Erica
and Geoff had a close call,</i>

07:01.296 --> 07:02.599
<i>I needed some advice</i>

07:02.600 --> 07:04.119
<i>on how to get close to Brea Bee.</i>

07:04.120 --> 07:07.259
Pops, it's a dire romantic emergency.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.199
Why do you think I hang out here all day

07:09.200 --> 07:10.763
buttering up bagels?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.829
Okay, I kind of hit it
off with this girl,

07:12.830 --> 07:14.329
but I think she might
be way too cool for me.

07:14.330 --> 07:16.310
- What do I do?
- Just be yourself.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.520
And?

07:17.521 --> 07:18.938
No "and." That's it.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.940
You never let me down, Pops.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.539
- Pops let me down!
- "Be yourself"?

07:23.540 --> 07:25.470
You? Yourself?

07:25.480 --> 07:27.649
- Being it?
- I know, Dave Kim.

07:27.650 --> 07:29.139
She's one of the chosen ones,

07:29.140 --> 07:30.409
the beautiful elite,

07:30.410 --> 07:32.309
the best kind of aloof.

07:32.310 --> 07:34.662
They'll never accept... this.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.289
You don't have to waft.
I know, Dave Kim!

07:37.290 --> 07:38.541
You need to get better advice.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.709
I know, Dave Kim!

07:39.710 --> 07:41.089
But who's cool enough to guide you?

07:41.090 --> 07:42.519
ADULT ADAM: <i> Turns out,
there was someone... </i>

07:42.520 --> 07:44.959
<i>Mr. Perott, our new guidance counselor.</i>

07:44.960 --> 07:48.560
<i>Yep, he wore a leather jacket
and was the epitome of cool.</i>

07:48.570 --> 07:50.386
I think I know, Dave Kim.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.431
Here's some advice...
Right after you graduate,

07:52.432 --> 07:53.769
take a couple years

07:53.770 --> 07:56.399
and bike right across Africa.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.879
See where this mixed-up
world got started.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.369
I can't hear a single word you're saying

07:59.370 --> 08:01.731
because I'm positive you're
gonna lop off your thumb.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.482
What's that? This silly thing?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.309
Haw! (EXHALES SHARPLY)

08:05.310 --> 08:07.903
That was so terrifyingly masculine, sir.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.879
Sure. So, what are we thinking here?

08:09.880 --> 08:11.389
College?

08:11.390 --> 08:13.075
Trade school? The Army?

08:13.076 --> 08:15.949
You probably can't tell, but I'm a...

08:15.950 --> 08:17.340
- Hardcore nerd?
- Whoa!

08:17.350 --> 08:18.999
- You can't call me that.
- I can.

08:19.740 --> 08:20.875
Because I was one, too.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.829
That's you? You're so...

08:22.830 --> 08:24.769
- Scrawny, zitty, pasty?
- Exactly.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.963
- How is this kid you?
- Well, I got a haircut,

08:26.964 --> 08:28.169
I slapped on some acne cream,

08:28.170 --> 08:29.569
and then I hit the gym.

08:29.570 --> 08:30.843
But that's only part of it, Adam.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.578
I need to know. Tell me everything.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.763
Okay.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.009
- You're just gonna do it?
- Why not?

08:35.010 --> 08:36.139
I mean, I already told three students

08:36.140 --> 08:37.849
to bike across Africa this morning.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.351
I can phone it in for
the rest of the day.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.020
So, we start with your signature look.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.149
For example, I always have
a pair of sunglasses on me,

08:43.150 --> 08:45.608
just in case I need to dramatically
toss them off like this.

08:45.609 --> 08:46.779
(SUNGLASSES THUD)

08:46.780 --> 08:49.487
Your disregard for eyewear makes
me know you mean business.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.349
Next, ABCG...

08:51.350 --> 08:52.859
Always Be Chewing Gum.

08:52.860 --> 08:56.619
That way, you look both busy
and laid-back all at once.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.929
Laid-back and busy.

08:57.930 --> 08:59.739
I'll be like a CEO from California.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.859
Third... Make sure you never give anyone

09:01.860 --> 09:03.659
your full attention.

09:03.660 --> 09:04.979
(SNAPS FINGERS) I'm over
here. See how you got

09:04.980 --> 09:06.239
a little confused there,
like there was something

09:06.240 --> 09:07.999
more interesting behind
you? There wasn't.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.091
I just made that up.

09:09.092 --> 09:10.519
So rude and effective.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.849
And finally, whenever you're walking,

09:12.850 --> 09:14.239
play a kick-ass jam in your head.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.722
Would the Ewok celebration
song <i> Yub Nub</i> work?

09:16.723 --> 09:18.474
I've never heard it before, but no.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.685
<i>♪ Whoa, Black Betty, bam-ba-lam ♪</i>

09:20.690 --> 09:23.479
<i>♪ Whoa, Black Betty, bam-ba-lam ♪
♪ Black Betty had a child ♪</i>

09:23.480 --> 09:26.699
ADULT ADAM: <i> And so Mr. Perott
took me under his badass wing.</i>

09:26.700 --> 09:28.901
<i>Meanwhile, Erica and
Geoff needed Barry's help</i>

09:28.902 --> 09:30.459
<i>to get their plan to fly.</i>

09:30.460 --> 09:31.869
We need to talk...

09:31.870 --> 09:33.656
Right after you tell
us what you're doing.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.169
I'm just cutting up various balls

09:35.170 --> 09:36.769
to see what's inside of them.

09:36.770 --> 09:37.909
Biggest surprise?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.569
Soccer ball... Nothing.

09:39.570 --> 09:41.160
- Is that my soccer ball?
- I wouldn't know.

09:41.170 --> 09:42.859
What brings you to Barry's Xanadu?

09:42.860 --> 09:44.479
You need to make quality time with Mom.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.849
- She misses you too much.
- Who can blame her?

09:46.850 --> 09:47.859
I'm a delight.

09:47.860 --> 09:48.889
No, idiot.

09:48.890 --> 09:51.099
She keeps showing up
unexpectedly, looking for you.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.464
My nosebleeds are way up.

09:52.465 --> 09:55.139
Ha! She's gonna find out
you're living in sin,

09:55.140 --> 09:56.760
freak out, and destroy your love.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.589
Barry, do you like it here?

09:58.590 --> 10:00.399
I'm living with my bros in this dope pad

10:00.400 --> 10:03.059
with a solid 2.1 GPA.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.519
I don't know how life
can get any better.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.299
If your Mom busts us, it's not only
the end of me living with Erica,

10:07.300 --> 10:08.690
it's the end of you living here, too.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.769
Oh, no.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.679
You shined a light on the consequences,

10:11.680 --> 10:13.571
and now I suddenly care. What do we do?

10:13.572 --> 10:15.531
We give Mom what she wants the most.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.179
- Game night?
- You know it, girl.

10:17.180 --> 10:19.299
I even brought <i> Connect Four</i>

10:19.300 --> 10:21.328
so that we can connect two.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.259
- Aww.
- Okay, well, you guys have family fun.

10:23.260 --> 10:24.319
- Bye.
- Run, Geoff.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.479
- Oh, no, Geoffrey.
- GEOFF: Wha...

10:25.480 --> 10:28.627
You're not going anywhere.
Tonight's an all-play.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.779
- But I was just dropping them off...
- Shh, shh, shh.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.547
- Okay, I'm in the hug now, so...
- Game night.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.039
Oh, I'm so excited,
I could (BLEEP) puke!

10:34.040 --> 10:35.079
(LAUGHS)

10:35.080 --> 10:36.370
I might, too.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.539
ADULT ADAM: <i> Mr. Perott had
taught me his tricks for being cool,</i>

10:40.540 --> 10:43.339
<i>and now I was ready to take
his advice out for a test drive.</i>

10:43.340 --> 10:45.499
Put this somewhere safe, Doc.

10:45.500 --> 10:48.219
What an incredibly informal
way to talk to an adult,

10:48.220 --> 10:49.231
but I'm on it.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.400
You can't make us move.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.276
We're allowed to sit here.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.649
Wait. Adam?

10:53.650 --> 10:56.279
In the flesh... And leather.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.799
- Me likey.
- I get it.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.609
His unearned confidence and
sunglasses make him desirable.

11:00.610 --> 11:01.899
That's exactly what
I'm going for, Dave Kim.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.279
Dude, you should go talk to Brea.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.879
Already on my way,<i> muchacho.</i>

11:04.880 --> 11:06.739
He casually threw in Spanish.

11:06.740 --> 11:09.279
ADULT ADAM: <i> Perott's advice
was working. I was crushing it.</i>

11:09.280 --> 11:11.699
<i>And this time, there really was
nothing that would stop me</i>

11:11.700 --> 11:13.339
<i>from lunching it up with Brea Bee.</i>

11:13.340 --> 11:15.629
Whoa. Goldnerd, is that you?

11:15.630 --> 11:17.040
- Make a hole.
- For some reason,

11:17.050 --> 11:18.590
my body's obliging your wishes.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.129
(SUNGLASSES THUD)

11:20.130 --> 11:22.940
Disposable shades and a leather jacket?

11:22.950 --> 11:25.017
What kind of a budget is
this guy working with?

11:25.018 --> 11:27.959
ADULT ADAM: <i> Success! Time
to put Perott's tips into overdrive.</i>

11:27.960 --> 11:30.259
- Adam.
- Oh, hey, Brea.

11:30.260 --> 11:32.519
- Didn't see you there.
- You look different.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.361
Are you in the spring production
of <i> West Side Story?</i>

11:34.362 --> 11:36.499
No, these are my new everyday threads.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.859
Ooh. My God.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.199
- That's a lot of gum.
- (MUFFLED) Thank you.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.720
- What?
- No, it's actually fine.

11:40.721 --> 11:41.979
Sorry, I can't understand you.

11:41.980 --> 11:44.160
- It's kind of cool, huh?
- Also, you're drooling a little.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.449
(SPITS)

11:45.450 --> 11:46.759
- (CHUCKLES)
- (NORMAL VOICE) I'm enjoying this, uh,

11:46.760 --> 11:48.740
give-and-take, you know?

11:48.750 --> 11:50.669
Are you looking at me, or
is there someone behind me?

11:50.670 --> 11:52.239
I'm not not looking at you.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.714
- It's still happening.
- So... whatcha doing later?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.799
I don't know. Hanging with the crew.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.209
- Do you wanna join?
- What's the plan?

11:59.210 --> 12:01.219
Plan is we pick you up at night.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.749
That's not really a time.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.419
- Doing what exactly?
- Stuff.

12:04.420 --> 12:08.102
Well, then I'll be there,
whenever that is, at some point.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.354
Ta.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.039
Brea just invited me to hang.
We have loose plans.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.829
Loose plans?

12:14.830 --> 12:16.067
It really is a different world.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.119
ADULT ADAM: <i> As my newfound
coolness was paying off,</i>

12:18.120 --> 12:20.319
<i>Goldberg game night was officially on.</i>

12:20.320 --> 12:22.139
BEVERLY: Guess who?
I'll give you a hint...

12:22.140 --> 12:23.779
I'm a beautiful blonde

12:23.780 --> 12:26.209
with delicious eyes and a hint of spunk.

12:26.210 --> 12:28.494
- Daryl Hannah!
- It's me, your mama.

12:28.495 --> 12:30.719
So, let me show you our other
games for the evening.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.626
<i>Bed Bugs! Mall Madness.</i>

12:32.627 --> 12:34.949
<i>Smurf Ahoy! Pig Pong.</i>

12:34.950 --> 12:37.339
<i>Don't Spill the Beans.
Crackers In My Bed.</i>

12:37.340 --> 12:39.819
<i>Girl Talk. Pizza Party! Pizza Party!</i>

12:39.820 --> 12:42.219
And <i> Mouse Trap.</i>

12:42.220 --> 12:44.589
What about you, Geoff?
Are you ready to get trapped?

12:44.590 --> 12:46.682
Trapped? Why? 'Cause
I'm lying? Is it hot in here?

12:46.683 --> 12:47.891
Mr. G, did you turn the heat on?

12:47.892 --> 12:50.185
In January? Not a chance!

12:50.186 --> 12:51.645
Okay. Uh, where's the bathroom?

12:51.646 --> 12:52.669
What are you talking about, Geoff?

12:52.670 --> 12:53.760
You know where the bathroom is.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.119
I don't know anything.
Maybe you remodeled.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.860
- Stop questioning me!
- Why don't I show you?

12:57.861 --> 12:59.737
Dude, pull it together.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.079
I can't. I'm afraid at any moment,

13:01.080 --> 13:02.365
I'll blurt out we're living together.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.399
Just relax.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.279
By the time we get back,
this all will have fallen apart.

13:06.280 --> 13:09.371
The Goldbergs have never even
been able to choose a game.

13:09.372 --> 13:12.333
(GASPS) (SINGSONG VOICE)
We're playing <i> Family Feud!</i>

13:12.334 --> 13:13.375
- Oh, they chose.
- No way.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.833
Dad, you're good with this?

13:14.834 --> 13:16.259
Survey says... Hoo-hoo!

13:16.260 --> 13:18.714
So fun. Let's start a feud
with your family, Erica.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.631
(NORMAL VOICE) Oh, we don't
feud against ourselves.

13:20.632 --> 13:22.160
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- Then who? Tell me who.

13:22.170 --> 13:24.469
Please welcome the Schwartz family.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.555
Lou and Linda, come on down.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.989
- Mom? Dad?
- Hi, sweetie.

13:27.990 --> 13:29.600
- We brought carrots!
- Whoo!

13:29.601 --> 13:31.810
Bathroom again! I can't
lie to my parents.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.605
Just focus on the game
and say nothing else.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.482
- I'll try.
- (TOILET FLUSHES)

13:36.483 --> 13:39.151
- Why did you do that?
- It'd be weirder if I didn't.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.571
- (TOILET FLUSHES)
- That one's for you.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.907
Okay, hands on buzzers.

13:43.908 --> 13:47.079
Name something you put on your pizza.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.619
- (BELL DINGS)
- We're living together. I mean, pepperoni!

13:48.620 --> 13:50.619
- What was that?
- He said pepperoni! Show me pepperoni!

13:50.620 --> 13:52.499
Ding, ding, ding! Geoff,
you have control.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.279
Doesn't feel like I do! And bathroom?

13:54.280 --> 13:55.339
ADULT ADAM: <i> While Geoff crumbled,</i>

13:55.340 --> 13:57.629
<i>I was ready for a cool
night of loose plans.</i>

13:57.630 --> 13:59.399
Hey, gang. Thanks for showing up.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.129
I totally haven't been ready
and waiting outside since 5:00.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.359
Why are you wearing shades at night?

14:03.360 --> 14:04.924
Did you just get your pupils dilated?

14:04.925 --> 14:07.679
I just have a blatant
disregard for social norms.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.299
- Like Bono or Anna Wintour.
- Badass.

14:10.300 --> 14:11.892
So, any idea what we're doing tonight?

14:11.893 --> 14:13.394
Let's say we play some baseball.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.819
I'm not a big baseball guy.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.773
I'm more into contact sports,
like hot potato or red rover.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.129
Don't you worry.

14:19.130 --> 14:20.693
There's gonna be plenty of contact.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.488
Yeah!

14:24.160 --> 14:25.779
(LAUGHS)

14:25.780 --> 14:28.239
Oh, my God! What did you just do?

14:28.240 --> 14:30.539
My man just hit a home
run in mailbox baseball!

14:30.540 --> 14:33.379
It's just like real baseball,
except it's vandalism.

14:33.380 --> 14:34.989
Bro, you're up.

14:34.990 --> 14:37.759
- Oh, no, thank you.
- But you're hitting cleanup.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.039
Meaning you pull over and we
clean up the mess you made?

14:40.040 --> 14:41.419
Meaning you're making a bigger mess

14:41.420 --> 14:43.048
with this bat I'm handing you.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.008
ADULT ADAM: <i> In that
moment, I had a choice... </i>

14:45.009 --> 14:47.762
<i>Show Brea I could hang with
the crew or do the right thing.</i>

14:47.763 --> 14:48.769
Hi-ya!

14:48.770 --> 14:50.159
- Oh!
- Oh!

14:50.160 --> 14:51.430
Holy crap!

14:51.433 --> 14:52.433
<i>I did neither.</i>

14:52.434 --> 14:54.059
- I missed it.
- My brother's Buick!

14:54.060 --> 14:55.070
Oh!

14:55.080 --> 14:57.389
And his bat? Not cool, man!

14:57.390 --> 14:59.299
(BRAKES SCREECH)

14:59.300 --> 15:00.929
You know what else isn't cool?

15:00.930 --> 15:02.579
This. Gah.

15:02.580 --> 15:05.539
I'm a fool to have wanted
to be accepted by you

15:05.540 --> 15:08.240
so I could charm a girl
who's way out of my league.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.700
- Jodie Foster?
- Brea.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.286
Adam, you did all this for me?

15:11.287 --> 15:13.459
You're so popular and pretty,

15:13.460 --> 15:17.082
and for a moment, I guess
I thought we had a connection.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.169
- I didn't know that.
- Now you do.

15:20.030 --> 15:21.211
Sorry about the mirror.

15:21.212 --> 15:24.213
I'd appreciate if we didn't go
through insurance to fix it.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.639
<i>As everything with Brea fell apart,</i>

15:25.640 --> 15:28.039
<i>Geoff and Erica were
still holding it together.</i>

15:28.040 --> 15:30.799
- Thank God it's over.
- And yet it's not, young Geoffrey.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.219
With tonight's success,

15:32.220 --> 15:34.619
Mom will surely want to
do this again every week.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.859
But I'll crumble under the
weight of our thousands of lies!

15:36.860 --> 15:37.969
It'll be fine.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.839
We'll do whatever it takes
to keep our secret.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.482
What secret? That you
guys are living together?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.692
Oh, no. She knows. Erica, she knows.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.339
I know she knows. How do you know?

15:46.340 --> 15:50.359
I suspected, and also Geoff blurted
it out three times tonight.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.439
It's true! We're living together!

15:51.440 --> 15:53.161
Why do I keep saying it? Pepperoni!

15:53.162 --> 15:55.519
- Before you get upset...
- Before? I'm furious!

15:55.520 --> 15:56.899
You have no right to be.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.979
We're both adults who can
make our own decisions.

15:58.980 --> 16:02.029
If you were adults, I wouldn't
have had to find out this way.

16:02.030 --> 16:03.039
- Mom...
- Don't.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.659
I'm not happy that you
guys are living together,

16:04.660 --> 16:07.059
but you know what breaks my
heart more than anything?

16:07.060 --> 16:08.069
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

16:08.070 --> 16:11.471
Is how far you went
to hide this from me.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.469
And I'm living with the JTP,

16:14.470 --> 16:16.389
which is a relatively minor betrayal

16:16.390 --> 16:17.852
in light of Erica's shocking news.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.449
ADULT ADAM: <i> After
striking out with Brea Bee,</i>

16:22.450 --> 16:25.119
<i>all that was left to do was clean up.</i>

16:25.120 --> 16:27.199
Mr. Perott, what are you doing here?

16:27.200 --> 16:29.219
Well, I have a police scanner,
and I heard there was trouble.

16:29.220 --> 16:31.059
- You all right, kid?
- Not even a little.

16:31.060 --> 16:32.069
Well, hop on. I'll give you a ride home.

16:32.070 --> 16:33.239
Or maybe you want to split a cab?

16:33.240 --> 16:34.993
Nah. Motorcycles are super safe.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.189
Here.

16:36.190 --> 16:37.979
I've already made a bunch
of terrible decisions today.

16:37.980 --> 16:40.450
I might as well just... continue.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.329
Just please drive slow!

16:42.330 --> 16:43.585
(ENGINE REVS)

16:43.586 --> 16:44.670
So, what's eating atcha?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.279
So, we're just gonna
talk about this now,

16:46.280 --> 16:47.769
like this isn't terrifying?

16:47.770 --> 16:49.039
Car, car, car!

16:49.040 --> 16:51.426
Ah, it's parked. Come on. Spill.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.678
I guess it all started... (GASPS)

16:52.679 --> 16:53.679
Oh, no, it's a curve!

16:53.680 --> 16:55.389
Do I lean with you or away from you?

16:55.390 --> 16:56.699
Oh-aah!

16:56.700 --> 16:58.079
I'm so scared!

16:58.080 --> 16:59.779
All right. It's gonna be
straight for a while.

16:59.780 --> 17:00.940
- This is your chance.
- Fine.

17:00.950 --> 17:02.894
I'll try to get it out before we die.

17:02.895 --> 17:03.899
There's an amazing girl,

17:03.900 --> 17:06.314
and my grandfather gave me
stupid advice, so I went to you,

17:06.315 --> 17:08.193
and you told me to be
cool, and it worked,

17:08.194 --> 17:11.154
but then I committed a postal
crime, and I hate myself.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.089
- (INSECT BUZZES)
- I got some good news for you, buddy.

17:13.089 --> 17:14.769
You're not cool.

17:14.770 --> 17:17.128
That's not good news,
and I just ate a bug.

17:17.130 --> 17:18.598
Look, I know I may seem cool,

17:18.599 --> 17:20.138
but I'm an unmarried 48-year-old

17:20.140 --> 17:21.969
with a crap ton of student debt,

17:21.970 --> 17:24.041
and I got dental issues
from chewing gum all day.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.294
What are you saying?

17:25.295 --> 17:27.835
Being cool is different
from being happy.

17:27.836 --> 17:30.399
That comes from feeling
good on the inside.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.040
And as far as I'm concerned,

17:32.050 --> 17:36.149
the old nerdy Adam Goldberg
has plenty to feel good about.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.479
Wait.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.189
Now you're telling me to just be myself?

17:40.190 --> 17:41.899
Yeah. Sounds good.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.629
You should do that.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.789
I can't believe it.

17:44.790 --> 17:46.429
Pops was right all along.

17:46.430 --> 17:47.649
Yellow light! Yellow light!

17:47.650 --> 17:48.739
- We got this!

17:48.740 --> 17:51.279

guided me in the right direction,</i>

17:51.280 --> 17:53.219
<i>my mom was left feeling betrayed.</i>

17:53.220 --> 17:55.139
- Living together, Murray.
- I get it.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.450
Li-ving to-ge-ther!

17:56.451 --> 17:57.618
Now I really get it.

17:57.619 --> 17:58.839
Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.100
Barry and Erica are
gonna move back here.

18:01.110 --> 18:02.719
We're gonna home-college them

18:02.720 --> 18:04.649
and occasionally let
them into the backyard

18:04.650 --> 18:06.043
for vitamin D and free play.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.461
I think everything's gonna be okay.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.379
You're okay with your
sweet little peanut

18:09.380 --> 18:12.099
shacking up with that walking
menace Geoff Schwartz?

18:12.100 --> 18:15.460
Menace? They already spent
the summer in a van

18:15.470 --> 18:17.179
half the size of a dorm room.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.556
That's beside the point.

18:18.557 --> 18:21.039
She loves him, he loves her.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.393
I don't like anybody, and I like him!

18:23.394 --> 18:26.271
Well, he is sweet and smart and
would do anything for her.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.232
And I've never seen her this happy.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.229
I guess.

18:30.230 --> 18:32.060
I know.

18:32.070 --> 18:35.899
For someone who worries so much
about failing as a mother,

18:35.900 --> 18:37.299
I'd take this as a win.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.078
ADULT ADAM: <i> It's crazy how,

18:44.330 --> 18:45.739
Listen, um...

18:45.740 --> 18:47.751
I just wanted to say
that I'm really sorry.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.920
Sorry? But I ruined your night.

18:49.921 --> 18:53.259
Are you kidding? I hate it
when those guys do that stuff.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.710
I never say anything.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.170
It's cool that you did.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.899
'Cause we both know there's
no one cooler than me.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.539
You relied on me for everything,

20:03.540 --> 20:07.039
and now you're a grown woman,

20:07.040 --> 20:08.419
and making all your own choices,

20:08.420 --> 20:11.168
