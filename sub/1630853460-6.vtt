17:54.490 --> 17:55.365
Out.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.617
Everyone out.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.620
Let's go! Move it!

18:30.859 --> 18:32.486
What are you all waiting for?

18:32.569 --> 18:33.570
Move!

18:34.613 --> 18:36.031
Let's go!

18:36.740 --> 18:38.075
Move!

19:32.629 --> 19:35.299
What is wrong
with your American friend?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.595
He has lost his spirit to live.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.139
And he is not my friend.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.907
He is American after all.

19:59.990 --> 20:03.660
Big talk, but weak inside.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.079
Tell him to eat.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.416
Or he endangers us all.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.378
We have a big fight ahead of us.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.130
What are you talking about? Fight?

20:15.964 --> 20:19.134
I have been in this place one week.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.596
My first night,

20:22.679 --> 20:24.598
I saw six men enter this room.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.433
Six.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.101
Just like us.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.728
They came out

20:29.811 --> 20:34.358
happy and fat, faces smothered in grease.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.987
But when night fell,
they were thrown into that pit out there.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.739
But not alone.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.825
You heard those roars, yes?

20:46.954 --> 20:48.038
That is a monster.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.749
Not from this world.

20:54.836 --> 20:58.090
Thirty seconds it took! Thirty seconds...

20:58.173 --> 20:59.883
And all six menâ€¦

21:00.425 --> 21:01.885
You speak no sense.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.638
If they plan to kill us tonight,
why waste this food on us?

21:04.721 --> 21:06.390
They want us strong.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.558
So we can fight it.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.852
To test its strength.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.105
To train this monster for war.

21:13.188 --> 21:16.566
But last week, the men got their weapons...

21:16.650 --> 21:19.611
then scattered like fools.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.905
We stick together...

21:22.489 --> 21:23.782
Perhaps we stand a chance!

21:24.366 --> 21:26.410
Perhaps we live to see another day.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.872
Till tomorrow!

21:47.931 --> 21:50.309
Come on, come on, come on. Translate!

22:02.321 --> 22:04.156
How do you know this?

50:51.339 --> 50:52.466
Stop talking.

50:54.593 --> 50:55.677
Be silent!

50:56.970 --> 50:57.929
I said go!

51:12.944 --> 51:13.945
Come on, go!

51:16.198 --> 51:17.157
I said to be silent!

51:54.694 --> 51:56.488
You do that again...

51:57.447 --> 51:59.282
we shoot you on the spot.

52:00.742 --> 52:02.452
Fools.
