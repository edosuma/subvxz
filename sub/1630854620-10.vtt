18:25.063 --> 18:28.648
- Yes, I am.
See? That was smarter.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.608
But not smart enough.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.444
[chortling]

18:33.530 --> 18:36.114
- Get her outta here!
- We don't have time!

18:36.199 --> 18:38.324
- I'm on it!
- Ooh, that looks fun.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.868
Not the time--put it in my
calendar for tonight:

18:40.912 --> 18:42.370
If still alive, chase tail.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.663
- Got it!
- Now what?

18:43.706 --> 18:46.207
- I don't know.
I've never caught it before.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.375
- Let me help you.

18:47.544 --> 18:51.254
- No, no! I'm gonna
solve this problem myself.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.255
[grunts]

18:52.340 --> 18:54.340
Aah!

18:54.425 --> 18:58.302
- Looks like booms
are back on the menu, boys.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.096
- Aah!

19:01.766 --> 19:03.766
- Chief, you saved us!

19:03.852 --> 19:05.351
- And now I need your help.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.479
- To pass legislation
outlawing booms forever?

19:08.523 --> 19:09.814
- Oh, sure, but first...

19:09.899 --> 19:11.899
Help me get this racoon
outta my butt.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.860
[fireworks popping]

19:13.862 --> 19:17.062
[mellow music]

19:17.115 --> 19:19.365
- This is my favorite song.
- Mine too.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.160
Fried sweet potatoes
are my favorite.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.870
- Samesies.
- But maybe we should

19:23.913 --> 19:25.288
Slow down a bit.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.623
You get the best gas mileage
driving 65 to--

19:27.667 --> 19:31.335
- 75 miles per hour.
I know. I'm going 75.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.630
- Ooh. Going a little fast,
aren't we?

19:34.716 --> 19:36.048
- I know how to drive.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.967
- Ooh, she's in a mood.
- You don't even know.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.886
- I can hear you!

19:39.971 --> 19:41.804
- What are you doing--77?

19:41.890 --> 19:44.599
- What are you running from?
- Where's the sun block?

19:44.642 --> 19:46.142
- You're not a good girl.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.394
You're an average girl at best.
- Okay, got it.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.438
- Can we please stop?
- Let's just have some quiet.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.440
- Your peers have all
surpassed you.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.733
- Aah!

19:53.860 --> 19:55.318
[chatter continues]

19:55.361 --> 19:57.987
I can't take one more
minute of me!

19:58.031 --> 20:01.699
[chatter continues]

20:01.743 --> 20:04.076
Aah!

20:06.998 --> 20:08.414
Oh--
- wha--oh!

20:08.458 --> 20:10.416
I had the craziest dream.
- I had the craziest dream.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.084
- But I won't bore you with it.
- But I won't bore you with it.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.047
- But I will tell you
what I learned from it.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.049
- Ooh! I'm listening.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.010
- I get what you were all
growly about earlier.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.471
I may not have giant
dream balls,

20:23.556 --> 20:25.348
But I have the power
to help myself.

20:25.433 --> 20:29.060
So from now on, I'm not gonna
bother you with my stuff.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.229
- No, no, no, please bother me.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.897
I'll spend as much time
as you want

20:32.941 --> 20:34.357
Talking about your problems.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.943
It's way less annoying
than talking to myself.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.820
- That's sweet, honey,
but this old dog can handle

20:39.864 --> 20:41.030
Whatever comes--
[pop]

20:41.115 --> 20:43.241
Aah! Why does this have to
be so scary?

20:43.326 --> 20:44.951
- It's okay, chief.
Shh, shh.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.661
President honey's got you.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.704
- Aw.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.164
Huh?

20:53.920 --> 20:56.295
- Oh, it was so exciting
to read this scene

20:56.339 --> 20:58.047
Because, as an actor,
it's really enjoyable

20:58.091 --> 21:00.800
To have all the lines
and all the screen time and--

21:00.885 --> 21:02.343
- Honey,
there's another of you!

21:02.428 --> 21:05.054
Where did she come from?
- They're both me.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.014
We shot the scenes
multiple times,

21:07.100 --> 21:09.183
And then they composited us--
- whoa!

21:09.269 --> 21:12.311
There's another one! So what
are they, clones or something?

21:12.397 --> 21:14.939
- No, it's a video effect.
- Ah--there's another clone!

21:15.024 --> 21:16.941
- Yeah, fine.
They're clones, chief.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.901
- Are you a clone?
- No.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.070
- That's exactly
what a clone would say.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.281
- I'm not a clone.
- Well, where are

21:23.324 --> 21:25.992
All the other clones?
- Fox put them all down

21:26.119 --> 21:28.828
After the shoot.
- Hmm. Probably would have

21:28.871 --> 21:30.997
Been easier
just to redraw you.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.667
[cheering]

21:35.169 --> 21:36.377
- That's nice,
jen and gabby.
