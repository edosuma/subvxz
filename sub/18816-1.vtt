Forgive me, Father...

03:08.550 --> 03:10.150
for I have indeed sinned.

Behold! A man of his calling!

Behold, a witness to
God's deep love for us all.

05:41.850 --> 05:44.650
Mrs. Geary, I do not
wish to be indelicate,

05:44.750 --> 05:48.150
but did you pay the
grave-diggers the extra shilling?

05:48.250 --> 05:49.700
What extra shilling?

05:49.800 --> 05:52.400
To bury your father
deeper in the ground.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.400
Resurrectionists pay extra

05:54.500 --> 05:56.550
to be buried two feet
deeper than the rest.

05:56.650 --> 06:00.050
That way, the grave-robbers
can't dig down to their meat

06:00.150 --> 06:01.350
before the sun comes up.

06:01.450 --> 06:04.500
My wife has no business
with the grave-diggers.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.550
Her father will rest
at the regular depth.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.550
Dear God.

06:21.650 --> 06:23.400
There walks a dead man.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.450
Who is that?

06:27.550 --> 06:29.550
Is hell opened up?

06:32.050 --> 06:35.200
Dear Lord Almighty,
is that your brother?

06:48.500 --> 06:51.550
Before we begin, may we
bow our heads in prayer?

06:52.750 --> 06:57.000
Our Father, which art in heaven,

06:57.100 --> 06:59.050
hallowed be thy name.

06:59.150 --> 07:01.750
Thy kingdom come...

07:01.850 --> 07:06.200
thy will be done on
Earth as it is in Heaven.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.150
Give us this day our daily bread...

07:18.800 --> 07:22.350
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy

07:22.450 --> 07:26.250
to take unto himself the soul of
our dear brother, here departed,

07:26.350 --> 07:28.750
we therefore commit
his body to the ground.

07:28.850 --> 07:30.900
Earth to Earth...

07:31.000 --> 07:34.400
...ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.950
In sure and certain
hope of the Resurrection.

07:41.550 --> 07:43.350
We will change our vile body...

07:46.850 --> 07:49.150
according to the mighty working

07:49.250 --> 07:53.350
whereby he is able to
subdue all things to himself.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.550
<i>Sir?</i>

08:14.650 --> 08:16.350
Mr. Delaney, is it?

08:17.450 --> 08:18.700
Sir?

08:20.200 --> 08:23.000
- James Delaney, is it?
- Who are you?

08:26.100 --> 08:28.300
- They said you were dead.
- I am.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.750
Such a shallow grave
they dug for my father.

08:31.850 --> 08:33.750
Are you short of a
couple of shillings?

08:33.850 --> 08:36.150
He was buried to the depth of my love.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.049
Last years, he disgraced me.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.200
Disgrace?

08:42.250 --> 08:43.799
Hm.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.650
Were those Negro words
he said over the grave?

08:51.900 --> 08:54.950
Madness comes out through
the umbilical cord.

08:55.050 --> 08:59.150
The pox in Africa goes directly to
the brain via these... these worms.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.750
They... they crawl
through your veins.

09:00.850 --> 09:03.150
- Where is he?
- He went to piss.

09:06.550 --> 09:09.800
Any business with him will
be conducted in my presence.

09:09.900 --> 09:12.800
See, I have the advantage,
I have read the will.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.250
Meaning what?

09:15.350 --> 09:17.600
Meaning I need to piss and
need no-one to hold my cock.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.600
Begging the lady's pardon.

10:04.050 --> 10:08.450
How came you to know
that your father was dead?

10:08.550 --> 10:11.150
I heard he was sick
and I boarded a ship.

10:11.250 --> 10:14.850
Yes, he was sick from madness.

10:14.950 --> 10:16.500
Hear that?

10:18.050 --> 10:19.600
Bile and bitterness.

10:19.700 --> 10:23.450
Not a single tear from
anyone at the graveside.

10:28.050 --> 10:30.150
I didn't hear any piss at the leather.

10:30.250 --> 10:34.000
Perhaps you had no need, or
perhaps you came out here with...

10:34.100 --> 10:35.400
With a purpose?

10:35.500 --> 10:37.100
James...

10:37.200 --> 10:40.800
- Who are you?
- I'm Thoyt, your father's lawyer.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.850
Smallpox butchered me down to the bone

10:42.950 --> 10:47.050
and, yes, I have other
business than pissing.

10:47.150 --> 10:48.400
You know, in all of London,

10:48.500 --> 10:50.800
only your father believed
you were still alive.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.050
It was a symptom of his madness.

10:53.150 --> 10:57.300
But he would talk to you, stand
on the north bank of the river

10:57.400 --> 10:59.900
and call out to you on the other side.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.350
Yes, I know, I heard him calling.

11:03.850 --> 11:05.100
I'll speak plainly.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.750
Your father drew up a will
of which I am executor.

11:07.850 --> 11:09.750
In it, you are his only heir.

11:09.850 --> 11:14.350
But, James, if you came home
expecting fortune, there is none.

11:14.450 --> 11:17.050
The only legacy is a poisoned chalice.

11:18.650 --> 11:21.300
Talk to me of poison.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.750
Well, it's a small...
strip of coastline,

11:26.850 --> 11:28.450
directly on the other
side of the world,

11:28.550 --> 11:31.550
which your father held by
treaty with the Nootka tribe.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.650
A wasteland.

11:33.750 --> 11:37.400
If America were a pig facing England,

11:37.500 --> 11:39.700
it is right at the pig's arse.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.350
Just rocks and Indians.

11:42.450 --> 11:47.400
The land in your father's
will is not only useless,

11:47.500 --> 11:50.300
it is dangerous to any who owns it.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.300
They're my rocks now.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.100
James...

11:56.200 --> 12:01.200
I can arrange the immediate
transfer of this particular asset.

12:12.050 --> 12:14.950
I'll send you a formal
proposition in writing.

12:40.350 --> 12:42.450
Good day, sir.

12:42.550 --> 12:45.400
These girls arriving are all whores.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.600
They attend the funeral of a widower

12:48.700 --> 12:50.550
'cause they know there'll
be lots of old men.

12:50.650 --> 12:53.000
And that animal from Africa

12:53.100 --> 12:55.300
is here to pick at an
old man's bones, too.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.400
Perhaps we should let
Thoyt deal with the matter.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.800
Let's call our carriage.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.700
One thing Africa did not cure...

13:20.800 --> 13:23.100
is that I still love you.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.950
And if you are ever
short of two shillings,

13:34.050 --> 13:35.750
please do not hesitate to ask,

13:35.850 --> 13:38.700
as Africa also served
me incredibly well.

13:41.250 --> 13:45.550
Well, then you will have no
need for legacies now, will you?

13:45.650 --> 13:47.200
We were just leaving.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.350
Hm.

14:29.450 --> 14:32.150
So, gentlemen, let's begin.

14:32.250 --> 14:35.350
A clerk will record
every word that's said,

14:35.450 --> 14:38.200
except when a fellow raises his hand.

14:38.300 --> 14:43.300
Words from a raised hand will not...

14:43.400 --> 14:45.150
enter the record.

14:46.250 --> 14:50.950
Now, the issue today
is old man Delaney.

14:51.050 --> 14:54.150
May he rot in hell.

14:54.250 --> 14:58.000
The death of that mad
old bastard was welcome

14:58.100 --> 15:00.150
and, as we thought at the time,

15:00.250 --> 15:04.150
beneficial for the
honourable East India.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.750
But things have changed.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.950
Mr. Thoyt, welcome.

15:11.050 --> 15:13.000
Give us the bad news.

15:13.100 --> 15:18.350
As the late Mr. Delaney's lawyer,
I attended the funeral,

15:18.450 --> 15:20.400
and a ghost appeared...

15:20.500 --> 15:23.750
a son we all thought dead in Africa.

15:23.850 --> 15:26.050
James Keziah Delaney.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.650
Mr. Wilton, I asked
you to do some digging.

15:31.750 --> 15:35.800
Which I have done, sir, and
most entertaining it has been.

15:35.900 --> 15:39.250
In temperament, he takes
after his mad mother.

15:39.350 --> 15:41.250
She was committed as
a resident of Bedlam.

15:41.350 --> 15:43.300
Just stick to what
we know about the boy.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.400
So, at the age of 11,

15:45.500 --> 15:47.750
his exhausted father and
new bride put his son in

15:47.850 --> 15:51.400
as a cadet at the East India Company
military seminary in Woolwich,

15:51.500 --> 15:53.800
the year of our Lord 1798.

15:53.900 --> 15:57.950
Delaney's son was a... company boy?

15:58.050 --> 16:01.650
And, Sir Stuart, odd to relate,

16:01.750 --> 16:04.350
the records show he was
once in your own regiment.

16:04.450 --> 16:05.900
Well...

16:06.000 --> 16:09.650
I commanded so many of the
little bastards, I forget.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.650
There is a copy of his attendance
record and the year-end report.

16:12.750 --> 16:14.850
Yeah, year end record too.

16:14.950 --> 16:16.700
My God!

16:16.800 --> 16:19.950
Corporal James Keziah Delaney.

16:20.050 --> 16:23.300
"Exceptional.
Exceptional. Exceptional.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.200
Musket, shipcraft,
leadership. Exceptional."

16:27.300 --> 16:31.400
But, sir, then along came
the year of our Lord 1800.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.150
Exceptional in different ways.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.400
I would guess that confidence
allowed his true savage nature

16:36.500 --> 16:38.200
and mother's madness to emerge.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.600
The necks he broke always
belonged to officers.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.750
And then there is the setting ablaze

16:42.850 --> 16:45.150
of a Navy boat in an
experiment with oil

16:45.250 --> 16:47.650
and mashed potatoes while drunk.

16:47.750 --> 16:50.300
And a fight with a
bear in Chancery Lane,

16:50.400 --> 16:54.950
a rebellion against the cooks
for bad custard, started by him,

16:55.050 --> 16:58.350
and he raved about fortunes
and hidden treasures.

16:58.450 --> 17:01.400
He tried to recruit other boys
to go down the river to India,

17:01.500 --> 17:04.950
to trade with Red Indians,
to take gold from the Aztecs.

17:05.050 --> 17:09.300
And more necks, more whores
and more custard. And finally...

17:09.400 --> 17:11.750
I am almost exhausted
in the telling of it.

17:11.849 --> 17:15.300
Finally, in the year of our Lord 1802,

17:15.400 --> 17:17.950
he took himself off to Africa.

17:20.250 --> 17:23.150
Well, now he is returned.

17:23.250 --> 17:27.050
And Delaney's will
leaves him everything.

17:27.150 --> 17:28.750
Including Nootka.

17:30.500 --> 17:34.400
Do we have a copy of the
Nootka Sound treaty yet?

17:34.500 --> 17:38.800
Where perhaps our lawyers
could pick it apart?

17:38.900 --> 17:42.350
It's yet to surface,
Sir Stuart. And...

17:42.450 --> 17:45.650
I believe only the original exists.

17:46.850 --> 17:52.650
So, our lengthy negotiations
with the daughter were in vain.

17:59.200 --> 18:04.350
If the will has not been read
and Nootka is so strategic to us,

18:04.450 --> 18:06.650
why don't we just... burn it?

18:07.900 --> 18:09.350
Even if I did,

18:09.450 --> 18:13.900
the son would have natural
priority over the daughter,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
according to God's law.

18:17.100 --> 18:21.700
And his return was
purposely in a public way.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.350
Hardly the action of a savage.

18:25.450 --> 18:28.700
Thank you, Mr. Thoyt,
you may leave us.

18:37.150 --> 18:42.900
Mr. Pettifer, I hope the report
from the Africa desk is as thorough

18:43.000 --> 18:46.400
as the one from Mr. Wilton
in the records office.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.250
According to charter records,

18:51.350 --> 18:54.750
he went to Cabinda aboard
a ship called Cornwallis,

18:54.850 --> 18:59.050
then boarded a ship called the
Influence, bound for Antigua.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.650
It was a slave ship.

19:01.750 --> 19:05.100
It sank off the Gold Coast,

19:05.200 --> 19:07.750
and it was assumed Delaney was dead.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.050
Then the rumours began.

19:13.650 --> 19:18.300
There have been rumours about James
Keziah Delaney these past ten years

19:18.400 --> 19:23.550
but in the file I have
put only the facts, sir,

19:23.650 --> 19:25.000
not the rumours.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.950
What are the rumours?

19:29.050 --> 19:34.900
Awful, and unnatural,
and, I'm sure, untrue.

19:36.650 --> 19:40.300
What fucking rumours?

20:59.650 --> 21:00.950
Right.

21:29.450 --> 21:32.050
Who's there? This pistol is loaded.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.250
My God.

21:38.350 --> 21:42.850
Perhaps by ship and by
carriage. Hm? Come here.

21:42.950 --> 21:44.850
Ah!

21:46.200 --> 21:49.850
Where's your propriety, Brace?
Servant and master? Get off me.

21:51.550 --> 21:53.200
- Begging your pardon, sir.
- What, why?

21:53.300 --> 21:56.050
Begging your pardon, but what
the hell are you doing here?

21:56.150 --> 21:57.850
Oh, no, there will
be no pardon for you

21:57.950 --> 22:00.200
because you are the
captain of the mutineers.

22:01.350 --> 22:05.850
And you will hang. For
being a pirate, you vagabond!

22:05.950 --> 22:07.150
How's the leg?

22:07.250 --> 22:12.150
I broke my left knee swinging
from a tree, being an ape for you.

22:13.450 --> 22:15.100
- You needed a brother.
- Still do.

22:16.700 --> 22:20.600
But a broken down, bent, buckled old
butler will have to be sufficient.

22:20.700 --> 22:22.250
You look the same.

22:24.050 --> 22:25.300
I'm not.

22:28.850 --> 22:31.800
Not tea, brandy.

22:34.100 --> 22:36.150
Two glasses.

22:36.250 --> 22:37.300
Sir?

22:37.400 --> 22:38.850
Fetch two glasses.

22:39.850 --> 22:43.500
They should have invited you.
To the wake, at least.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.750
Serving stew in the backroom,
to hell with that.

22:46.850 --> 22:50.750
In all of this dirty city,
there is no-one that I can trust,

22:50.850 --> 22:51.950
do you understand?

22:52.050 --> 22:53.850
Apart from you.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.150
Ah!

23:07.550 --> 23:11.300
You can spare me the old
maiden splutter, Brace.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.126
I know that you polish
off at least half a bottle

23:13.150 --> 23:16.100
of Delaney Company
Brandy every night.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.550
Hm?

23:25.250 --> 23:26.450
James...

23:28.200 --> 23:30.600
You could have written
to your father just once.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.300
In the end, he was calling for you.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.500
I know.

23:36.100 --> 23:39.550
I'd say, "Come on, come in.

23:39.650 --> 23:41.950
Before the tide gets your shoes."

23:42.050 --> 23:45.300
And he would light
these fires on the shore,

23:45.400 --> 23:47.650
call out your name and talk to you.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.650
Is that grief, James?

23:52.850 --> 23:54.150
Is what grief?

23:57.150 --> 24:02.850
And all the while, these gulls
hovered around picking at him.

24:02.950 --> 24:05.750
Gulls only come if there is meat.

24:05.850 --> 24:08.450
Oh, aye, meat there was.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.200
Men of affairs, they call themselves.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.950
Don't you want to know what
it is they wanted, these gulls?

24:15.050 --> 24:16.650
I know already.

24:17.450 --> 24:19.500
I doubt that.

24:21.450 --> 24:25.000
A base of land called Nootka Sound.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.700
Nootka was my mother's tribe.

24:30.450 --> 24:32.700
No. No, no, James.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.550
Your mother came from Naples.

24:35.650 --> 24:39.050
He bought some land
and he bought a wife.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.850
And he bought them both for gunpowder.

24:46.450 --> 24:49.900
He told me never to speak
to you of buying her.

24:51.250 --> 24:53.100
And yet he told me everything.

24:54.850 --> 24:56.100
When?

24:56.200 --> 24:58.250
When he lit his fires
on the foreshore.

25:03.150 --> 25:05.900
Nothing you could tell me about
that man would surprise me.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.750
He was half human at the end
and he would squat right here and

25:10.850 --> 25:14.350
make deals with ghosts in the flames.

25:15.550 --> 25:17.650
And he would speak in a
language that was like...

25:17.750 --> 25:19.850
It was like ravens fighting.

25:24.950 --> 25:28.150
And he would talk to you, James.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.700
And he would talk to Anna.

25:31.900 --> 25:32.950
Salish.

25:39.350 --> 25:41.500
My mother's name was Salish.

25:42.850 --> 25:46.350
You know things only he and I knew.

25:46.450 --> 25:48.000
Yeah.

25:50.350 --> 25:53.700
And it's best we never talk
of her when we've had brandy.

25:59.250 --> 26:02.100
See, when you live alone
with a madman, you...

26:02.200 --> 26:04.350
You become half mad yourself.

26:06.350 --> 26:10.000
But here's the thing, James.
This Nootka Sound is a curse.

26:10.100 --> 26:14.050
It will bring the King and
Empire down upon your head.

26:14.150 --> 26:16.850
Please don't talk to
me of sense, Brace,

26:16.950 --> 26:21.150
because if it is you,
I might believe it.

26:23.250 --> 26:27.500
And I have sworn to
do very foolish things.

27:55.250 --> 27:58.900
If you're looking for money,
those accounts are ten years old.

28:02.650 --> 28:05.950
Where are my father's
inventories and his shipping logs?

28:08.050 --> 28:09.200
He burnt them all.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.300
The only reason these accounts
survived was because I hid them

28:14.400 --> 28:16.200
in case the taxman came knocking.

28:17.950 --> 28:19.900
That was delivered at 6 AM this morning

28:20.000 --> 28:22.600
by a servant of Mr. Robert Thoyt.

28:24.300 --> 28:27.150
Thoyt has been trying to buy
the Delaney Shipping Company

28:27.250 --> 28:29.000
from your father for three years.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.150
Each time, your da
would go into the street,

28:31.250 --> 28:34.750
scoop up some horse shite and
package it up by way of reply.

28:37.750 --> 28:42.750
I imagine the envelope
contains a financial offer.

28:42.850 --> 28:46.000
I imagine it does. Do you
have any horse shit on you?

28:51.500 --> 28:55.850
Listen, the accounts told me that
we have a leasehold of 50 years

28:55.950 --> 28:59.100
on the offices in West India
docks, 32 years left to run.

29:00.250 --> 29:03.550
Your father hadnae been up
there in eight years, sir.

29:03.650 --> 29:05.350
They're all locked up.

29:05.450 --> 29:06.950
Then I will need the key.

30:05.300 --> 30:06.600
Oi!

30:06.700 --> 30:08.800
What are you doing with the door?

30:08.900 --> 30:11.650
You want a bush, you come through me.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.400
That is private property.

30:13.500 --> 30:17.150
Helga, it's so good to see
that you're still working...

30:17.250 --> 30:18.750
even still alive.

30:18.850 --> 30:21.350
You know that I lay with you
when I was just a little boy.

30:21.450 --> 30:23.000
Where did you get the key?

30:23.100 --> 30:25.850
This key? This is my father's key.

30:25.950 --> 30:29.150
Horace Delaney. Mmm?

30:30.850 --> 30:32.550
Shit.

30:32.650 --> 30:33.900
Yes, shit.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.350
Your father stopped
coming. It was empty.

30:37.450 --> 30:40.400
It was wasted, so close to the docks.

30:43.650 --> 30:45.050
You want tea?

30:45.150 --> 30:46.250
No.

30:48.550 --> 30:49.900
Do you want to fuck?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.600
- No, I want my family offices back.
- Oh, God.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.650
How much do you make here?

30:59.850 --> 31:03.650
With the workers in the yard and
the boats that moor at the wharf...

31:04.650 --> 31:06.300
we make £10 a day.

31:06.400 --> 31:09.500
I can give you five
and whatever you like.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.800
Boys, girls, suck, fuck...

31:14.250 --> 31:16.950
You have two hours to get out.

31:17.050 --> 31:18.550
You say I took your cherry.

31:20.650 --> 31:21.800
Mm-hmm.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.750
Where have you been, little boy?

31:27.850 --> 31:29.700
- I have been in the world.
- Oh.

31:32.250 --> 31:35.750
I have girls, but I also have men.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.150
They're not very good men.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.650
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.050
They have rocks for hearts.

31:44.150 --> 31:46.450
They have knives and ropes.

31:46.550 --> 31:48.000
If you have any sense...

31:51.950 --> 31:55.450
People who do not know
me soon come to understand

31:55.550 --> 31:57.250
that I do not have any sense.

31:59.450 --> 32:01.290
Now, please do not
misunderstand the situation.

32:01.350 --> 32:02.450
You send me 12 men,

32:02.550 --> 32:05.800
I will return you 12 sets
of testicles in a bag,

32:05.900 --> 32:08.950
and we can watch your little
whores devour them together,

32:09.050 --> 32:13.100
before I chop off your
trotters and boil them.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.050
Two hours.

32:20.550 --> 32:21.900
You...

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I remember you.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.850
I remember you. Heard the stories.

32:29.050 --> 32:31.650
If I give you a girl, I
will never see her again.

32:33.300 --> 32:34.500
You heard right.

32:35.900 --> 32:37.250
Be punctual.

32:56.550 --> 32:59.900
- They've brought the carriage up.
- Yes. I'm coming.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.350
You're not imploring him
to relinquish his deed,

33:24.450 --> 33:26.400
you're insisting that,
for his own welfare,

33:26.500 --> 33:28.450
he submit his claim to you.

33:30.200 --> 33:34.050
Implore is a more feminine word.

33:36.450 --> 33:38.350
And why must you be a woman to him?

33:41.950 --> 33:46.000
The offer of £50 should be
conditional on him leaving England.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.850
Why?

33:47.950 --> 33:51.050
Because if he does not leave
England, I will kill him.

33:51.150 --> 33:52.450
Why?

33:58.700 --> 34:00.350
That is a very good question.

34:03.550 --> 34:07.200
Why would I feel that way about
him, after meeting him only once?

34:09.150 --> 34:12.000
The son of the same father
as the woman I love...

34:15.650 --> 34:18.150
Why does a soldier know
that a nigger bowing low

34:18.250 --> 34:20.850
has a dagger in his shoe
and is reaching for it?

34:24.949 --> 34:27.949
Delaney is nothing
more than a nigger now.

34:28.050 --> 34:29.449
You know that, don't you?

34:32.650 --> 34:36.350
I have talked with seasoned
merchants who could barely

34:36.449 --> 34:38.800
bring themselves to
repeat these stories.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.449
Among Christian soldiers,

34:43.550 --> 34:48.050
it's customary to bury the
bodies of your fallen enemy

34:48.150 --> 34:52.550
and shoo away the dogs and
crows that come for the carrion.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.250
Not kneel down beside them.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.650
Try again,

35:12.750 --> 35:16.150
this time reflecting the
disgust you naturally feel

35:16.250 --> 35:17.750
now you know the truth.

35:26.700 --> 35:27.850
Hmm?

35:44.050 --> 35:47.800
The dogs here live off
the flesh from suicides

35:47.900 --> 35:49.850
jumping off Blackfriars Bridge.

35:51.050 --> 35:54.050
Never known one go
tamely to a man's hand.

35:55.500 --> 35:58.300
Must be some witchcraft
you picked up somewhere.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.200
What do you want?

36:05.150 --> 36:09.200
You think your father's
kid feeds himself.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.350
I heard you done a
lot of evil over there.

36:12.450 --> 36:16.150
Now it's time for you to do some
bleeding good among your own.

36:16.250 --> 36:21.150
Me and my wife have looked
after that boy for ten years

36:21.250 --> 36:24.600
with not one penny from
you and nothing but threats

36:24.700 --> 36:27.750
from the mad old bastard
you just put in the ground.

36:27.850 --> 36:31.000
Now you're back, I want payment.

36:31.100 --> 36:35.650
If it wasn't for us, that kid
would be sucking cocks in St. Giles.

36:41.050 --> 36:43.550
Mr. Ibbotson, I've been
meaning to pay you a visit.

36:43.650 --> 36:44.900
Bullshit.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.950
You're a liar just like your
father. You're a Delaney.

36:49.050 --> 36:50.900
Tell you what...

36:51.000 --> 36:53.300
You get me an address,

36:53.400 --> 36:56.650
and I will get you payment in
the form of a banker's draft.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.700
- How much?
- Enough.

37:03.500 --> 37:04.850
Good day.

37:07.650 --> 37:10.400
You don't even ask how
your own blood fares.

38:03.700 --> 38:08.200
If you don't approve of me
steadying my nerves with Madeira,

38:08.300 --> 38:10.300
then perhaps you should
consult the directory of

38:10.400 --> 38:13.350
the Royal College of Physicians,
see you know many others of them

38:13.450 --> 38:15.550
will agree to carry
out this kind of work.

38:15.650 --> 38:19.550
I intend to mix the contents of
his stomach with potassium oxide,

38:19.650 --> 38:22.200
calcium oxide and nitric acid.

38:26.650 --> 38:30.250
I'll know in 20 minutes. Come
back when the church bell chimes.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.350
You did this.

38:58.450 --> 39:00.150
- You will pay for this.
- No.

39:09.500 --> 39:13.000
No, because I have no
fear to feed you with.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.550
No fear to give you
and I will prove it.

39:17.650 --> 39:22.750
Sing for me like you once did
as the river caught your tongue.

39:22.850 --> 39:25.400
<i>Ee neem sea wo ha ha.</i>

39:25.500 --> 39:26.650
Suicide.

39:28.850 --> 39:31.200
That will teach you
not to steal, won't it?

39:32.850 --> 39:35.250
<i>Ee neem sea wo ha ha.</i>

39:35.350 --> 39:37.650
<i>Ee neem sea wo ha.</i>

39:41.000 --> 39:43.750
You're not here. You are not here.

39:43.850 --> 39:47.150
I have no fear for you and
I have no guilt for you.

39:52.700 --> 39:55.550
I did as others did
and as others had me do,

39:55.650 --> 39:57.400
and we are all owned,

39:57.500 --> 39:59.600
and we have all owned others...

40:02.500 --> 40:06.050
so don't you dare stand
there and judge me.

40:09.050 --> 40:12.700
Today, I have work to do.

40:39.600 --> 40:44.050
The horizontal chamber contains
the gas from the stomach contents.

40:48.100 --> 40:49.150
Now...

40:50.500 --> 40:51.900
the moment of truth.

41:00.350 --> 41:05.900
As you see, the flame has formed
a reflective surface on the glass,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
what is known as an arsenic mirror.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.000
Your father was poisoned.

41:14.650 --> 41:17.000
From the density of the mirror,

41:17.100 --> 41:21.050
I would say heavy doses
over a short period,

41:21.150 --> 41:25.350
and, yes, it would have affected
his mind in the later stages.

41:28.650 --> 41:30.300
You want him reburied?

41:30.400 --> 41:33.700
Yes, and sewn back up into one piece.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.600
I would recommend they
dig a bit deeper this time.

41:39.050 --> 41:41.650
If this body is used
for any other purpose,

41:41.750 --> 41:44.450
I will find you and I will kill you.

41:44.550 --> 41:46.950
You tell every member
of your profession...

41:49.150 --> 41:51.050
I know things about the dead.

41:53.850 --> 41:55.700
And I will know.

41:55.800 --> 41:59.550
Do you want any words said
over him when we put him back?

41:59.650 --> 42:01.050
No-one is listening.

42:41.350 --> 42:43.250
He's meeting with the East India.

42:46.350 --> 42:49.200
Apparently, they're happy
to deal with the devil

42:49.300 --> 42:50.700
and leave us penniless.

42:53.050 --> 42:55.300
The letter, it seemed, did no good.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.500
He was never one to be told.

42:59.450 --> 43:04.050
Well, we have legal rights, and
it's time that savage was made aware.

43:04.150 --> 43:06.950
- I know he's your brother but...
- Half-brother.

43:10.250 --> 43:12.050
he leaves me no choice.

43:23.850 --> 43:25.550
- I'm going out.
- Good.

43:25.650 --> 43:29.000
I'm tired of these empty threats
you keep bandying around.

43:32.650 --> 43:33.750
Empty?

43:35.850 --> 43:37.950
I'm your husband and you are my wife.

43:39.650 --> 43:43.200
And I will protect our interests
by whatever means necessary.

43:44.850 --> 43:46.550
And as for him,

43:46.650 --> 43:49.000
well, he should have
stayed where he belongs,

43:49.100 --> 43:52.700
in the jungle, dancing
naked and screwing wild pigs,

43:52.800 --> 43:54.600
and his slaves in their chains.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.650
He will leave soon.

44:00.750 --> 44:03.400
You're quite right, he
doesn't belong in this world.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.950
I decided to bring it in person.

44:50.250 --> 44:55.450
Now, this is for the past,
the present and the future.

45:02.300 --> 45:03.600
Take me to the boy.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.750
I want to see if you're
lying to me or not.

45:06.850 --> 45:08.800
Yes, sir, Mr. Delaney.

45:20.600 --> 45:22.350
Do you want to talk with him?

45:22.450 --> 45:26.000
No, I'm not a fit man
to be around children.

45:30.850 --> 45:34.400
Fate can be hard, so you put
money aside for his future in case

45:34.500 --> 45:38.900
he grows up to be rash, like me.

45:40.950 --> 45:42.650
Will you wish to see him again?

45:44.550 --> 45:47.200
No. Not ever.

46:45.550 --> 46:49.250
John Pettifer, East India
Company, Africa desk.

46:51.250 --> 46:52.900
James Delaney.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.300
Benjamin Wilton, records,

46:55.400 --> 46:58.350
Abraham Appleby, our
delegate from Christ,

46:58.450 --> 47:01.250
and this is Sir Stuart Strange,

47:01.350 --> 47:04.200
Chairman of the Honourable
East India Company

47:04.300 --> 47:06.950
across the surface
of the entire Earth.

47:09.300 --> 47:10.850
You don't remember me.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.650
One remembers those one looks up to

47:14.750 --> 47:17.400
more readily than those
you look down upon.

47:17.500 --> 47:19.050
I believe you were a cadet.

47:19.150 --> 47:21.000
Yes, you were my commander.

47:21.100 --> 47:26.700
Oh, well, blame brandy
and old age, hmm?

47:26.800 --> 47:28.450
Please, sit.

47:37.900 --> 47:40.050
- Brandy?
- No.

47:42.150 --> 47:44.650
To begin, may I offer our sincere...?

47:44.750 --> 47:48.800
Please understand...
hypocrisy I hate most.

47:50.550 --> 47:54.050
- Indeed. Let us not pretend...
- No, do not pretend.

47:55.500 --> 47:59.550
I wonder if Mr. Appleby might
be allowed to finish a sentence?

48:02.050 --> 48:03.700
We are told that in
your father's will,

48:03.800 --> 48:08.700
you were bequeathed a piece of
territory which lies just here.

48:10.050 --> 48:11.050
Mm-hmm.

48:12.850 --> 48:16.150
As you will see, the small piece
of land your father bought off

48:16.250 --> 48:20.600
the Indians is now by virtue of
geography a point of contention

48:20.700 --> 48:24.750
between His Majesty's Government
and the cursed United States.

48:29.650 --> 48:31.150
So...

48:34.000 --> 48:35.150
Hmm?

48:35.250 --> 48:38.900
Ah, Mr. Delaney, you've been
in Africa for a number of years,

48:39.000 --> 48:43.050
so you may be unaware that
Britain and the United States

48:43.150 --> 48:45.300
are currently at war.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.750
I know.

48:46.850 --> 48:50.100
Ah, well, you will understand,
then, that private ownership of

48:50.200 --> 48:53.150
the Nootka Sound landing
ground represents an opportunity

48:53.250 --> 48:55.400
for our enemies who
dispute its sovereignty

48:55.500 --> 48:58.750
when the time comes
to draw the border.

48:58.850 --> 49:00.250
I know.

49:01.750 --> 49:03.650
Yes, I know. I also know...

49:03.750 --> 49:06.300
that the British and
American Government

49:06.400 --> 49:09.300
are preparing to begin their
secret peace talks in Ghent,

49:09.400 --> 49:10.750
aren't they?

49:10.850 --> 49:15.950
And negotiators are
preparing depositions to draw

49:16.050 --> 49:19.700
the Canadian-American border for
when the current hostilities end.

49:19.800 --> 49:22.550
And because of the strategical
position of Nootka Sound,

49:22.650 --> 49:25.250
whoever owns it has legal entitlement

49:25.350 --> 49:28.750
to the entire island of Vancouver,

49:28.850 --> 49:30.000
which is...

49:31.250 --> 49:33.150
Well, which is the gateway to...

49:34.650 --> 49:35.700
to China.

49:38.450 --> 49:39.500
Hmm?

49:42.650 --> 49:44.950
So this...

49:46.100 --> 49:49.750
This small piece of
land that my father...

49:49.850 --> 49:52.150
bought for beads,

49:52.250 --> 49:54.350
bless him, and gunpowder,

49:54.450 --> 49:56.700
some 30 years ago,

49:56.800 --> 50:01.150
actually will be very,
very valuable to the Crown

50:01.250 --> 50:03.750
and to the East India,

50:03.850 --> 50:07.550
but also incredibly
valuable to the Americans.

50:07.650 --> 50:11.150
Mr. Delaney, as a British subject,

50:11.250 --> 50:15.050
you owe a debt of loyalty
to your King and country.

50:17.800 --> 50:20.350
If patriotism is not
in your motivation,

50:20.450 --> 50:22.650
perhaps money can be.

50:24.450 --> 50:26.650
Before your unexpected return,

50:26.750 --> 50:29.850
we had agreed a figure
with your half-sister.

50:29.950 --> 50:32.700
Her husband drove a
particularly hard bargain.

50:33.750 --> 50:36.650
I'm sorry, no. Nootka
Sound is not for sale.

50:38.200 --> 50:39.300
Open the envelope.

50:40.900 --> 50:41.950
Are you deaf?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.550
- Oh, Mr. Delaney...
- Mr. Delaney, perhaps...

50:45.650 --> 50:48.800
The Leviathan of the Seas, is it?

50:48.900 --> 50:50.900
The terrible shadow?

50:52.150 --> 50:56.450
The beast with a million
eyes and a million ears?

50:56.550 --> 50:57.650
Conquest?

50:58.700 --> 50:59.900
Rape?

51:01.050 --> 51:02.200
Plunder?

51:03.650 --> 51:05.850
I studied your methods in your school.

51:07.650 --> 51:13.250
And I do know the evil that you
do because I was once part of it.

51:24.100 --> 51:26.400
- Are you sure you won't take a brandy?
- Yes.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.550
Please take a moment to consider
the consequences of your refusal...

51:29.650 --> 51:33.100
What consequences? What consequences?

51:33.200 --> 51:34.700
Perhaps we should adjourn.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.850
Mr. Delaney...

51:37.250 --> 51:40.350
I'll give you one
last chance to behave

51:40.450 --> 51:45.250
like a loyal subject of His Majesty
and the lawful crown of England.

51:46.700 --> 51:49.600
Sell this land for a reasonable price.

51:57.450 --> 51:58.900
Hmm...

52:01.250 --> 52:02.450
Please.

52:06.250 --> 52:11.050
The balance of your father's
mind was, well, unstable...

52:12.250 --> 52:14.700
but you have no such excuse.

52:14.800 --> 52:18.300
Now, why don't you just
open the fucking envelope?

52:23.300 --> 52:24.350
Mmm?

52:35.000 --> 52:36.100
Hmm...

52:45.250 --> 52:46.950
Good day.

52:59.350 --> 53:00.700
Well...

53:03.200 --> 53:07.050
The son is as unstable as the father.

53:09.050 --> 53:11.800
Perhaps the rumours
about him are true.

53:12.900 --> 53:16.250
I'd hoped to settle this
matter in a modern way,

53:16.350 --> 53:18.850
but that's not going to be possible.

53:23.100 --> 53:24.400
He's all yours.

53:41.200 --> 53:44.950
<i>Dear James, the letter I sent
to you this morning was written</i>

53:45.050 --> 53:48.750
<i>under the supervision of my husband,</i>

53:48.850 --> 53:51.300
<i>to whom I am happily married.</i>

53:55.800 --> 53:58.600
<i>It is more than ten years
since you went away,</i>

53:58.700 --> 54:01.900
<i>and at the time I was grateful that
you had decided to leave England,</i>

54:02.000 --> 54:03.550
<i>for both of our sakes.</i>

54:07.300 --> 54:10.950
<i>Whatever happens with this
business of inheritance,</i>

54:11.050 --> 54:14.400
<i>and no matter if it
results in a dispute,</i>

54:14.500 --> 54:20.250
<i>I hope I can trust you to keep
the secrets of the past buried,</i>

54:20.350 --> 54:23.050
<i>buried in a deeper grave.</i>
