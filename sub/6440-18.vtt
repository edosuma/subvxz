00:28.514 --> 00:32.415
Hey, Sasha,
say something presidential.

00:32.652 --> 00:37.715
Whoa, Chloe, slow down.
The election hasn't even started yet.

00:39.025 --> 00:41.357
What do you think Sasha's chances are?

00:41.527 --> 00:45.190
Well, she knows the most about student
government, she's worked her way up...

00:45.365 --> 00:49.825
...she's on a ton of committees,
but she's more of a worker than a leader.

00:50.803 --> 00:52.270
How about Paul?

00:52.438 --> 00:54.406
He's certainly the most qualified...

00:54.574 --> 00:57.975
...but elections aren't about merit,
they're about popularity.

00:58.678 --> 01:00.703
Which brings us to Felice.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.144
Head cheerleader and president
of the drama club.

01:03.316 --> 01:06.717
That definitely gives her an edge,
not to mention that she's really hot.

01:06.886 --> 01:10.151
Yeah, but her name rhymes with
the French word for luggage.

01:10.323 --> 01:14.589
Okay, glad to see you're not
reaching for reasons to hate her.

01:18.664 --> 01:21.064
I saw you taking Sasha's picture.

01:21.234 --> 01:24.362
Why haven't you taken mine?
That qualifies as biased.

01:24.537 --> 01:29.804
I plan on running photos and bios of all
the candidates, including you, Felice.

01:30.309 --> 01:33.073
Hey, Chloe, what about the editorial?

01:33.246 --> 01:35.806
You can only endorse one candidate,
so who's it gonna be?

01:36.249 --> 01:39.844
Who cares? No matter what she says,
people are gonna vote for me.

01:40.019 --> 01:44.422
Never underestimate the need for the
clinically ambitious to pad their resumes.

01:46.826 --> 01:49.852
You want to avoid
the pain and humiliation of losing?

01:50.096 --> 01:52.462
Drop out now.

02:47.586 --> 02:48.951
Ow!

04:41.200 --> 04:43.566
That's gotta be my all-time
worst nightmare.

04:43.736 --> 04:47.297
I get stung by one bee, I swell up
like a grapefruit, but over a hundred...

04:47.473 --> 04:49.407
How'd they get into Paul's bathroom?

04:49.575 --> 04:51.543
The Center for Environmental Protection...

04:51.710 --> 04:54.178
...is sending a team
from Metropolis to investigate.

04:54.346 --> 04:56.473
Guess that's gonna
shake up our class election.

04:56.649 --> 04:59.618
Not really. I mean, Paul's name
is still on the ballot...

04:59.785 --> 05:02.913
...and he wouldn't take office until fall.
He could recover by then.

05:03.088 --> 05:05.079
Out of sight, out of mind.

05:05.257 --> 05:07.487
My call, he gets a few sympathy votes.
That's it.

05:07.660 --> 05:10.322
- Nice to see the softer side of Pete.
- Seriously.

05:10.496 --> 05:14.626
Anyway, there's a new candidate on the
horizon who is gonna make things interesting.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.734
Oh, yeah, who's that?

05:21.273 --> 05:24.470
- What have you done?
- I see a big future ahead of you in politics.

05:24.643 --> 05:26.440
You're straightforward.
People like you.

05:27.312 --> 05:29.837
- No way. Definitely not.
- You've got the whole package:

05:30.015 --> 05:32.575
Looks, brains, and that whole
farm-boy charm.

05:33.752 --> 05:35.379
Did I mention the perks of power?

05:35.554 --> 05:38.819
- If it was so great, why didn't you run?
- I know my strengths.

05:38.991 --> 05:41.653
I'm more the power behind the throne.

05:41.827 --> 05:44.955
The guy behind the guy.
The one who makes it all happen.

05:45.130 --> 05:47.098
- Pete Ross, the kingmaker.
- Exactly.

05:47.266 --> 05:51.032
All you gotta do is show up, shake
a couple hands, give a speech. It's easy.

05:51.203 --> 05:54.263
And we wonder why our politicians
aren't great leaders.

05:54.440 --> 05:58.171
<i>Clark, Clark, Clark, Clark...</i>

06:31.543 --> 06:34.273
- You look like you could use some help.
- No, I'm fine.

06:34.446 --> 06:38.405
Hans, I need you out on Route 90,
two miles east of the mansion.

06:38.584 --> 06:41.610
- A red Mustang with engine trouble.
- What are you doing?

06:41.787 --> 06:43.482
Calling my mechanic.

06:43.655 --> 06:48.183
Not that I don't appreciate your attempt
at postmodern chivalry, but I said I was fine.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.158
Dolce & Gabbana and a vocabulary?

06:51.330 --> 06:54.925
You've got Metropolis written all over you.
What brings you to Smallville?

06:55.100 --> 06:57.261
You're the sheriff
come to run me out of town?

06:57.436 --> 07:01.099
Did the attitude come with the couture,
or was it an accessory?

07:01.273 --> 07:03.798
If you must know,
I'm thinking about moving here.

07:03.976 --> 07:07.571
I'd ask you what it's like,
but you don't look like a local.

07:07.746 --> 07:12.376
I've lived here since last fall. I couldn't
wait to get out, but it's growing on me.

07:12.551 --> 07:16.180
Well, why the change?
The Norman Rockwell ambiance seduce you?

07:16.355 --> 07:19.722
Appearance is deceptive.
Nothing around here is what it seems.

07:19.892 --> 07:22.918
I'm intrigued. What do you mean?

07:23.095 --> 07:26.758
All these questions. This is
beginning to sound like an interview.

07:33.572 --> 07:36.439
- Who do you work for?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

07:36.608 --> 07:41.238
If I toss these into the woods,
you really are gonna need a tow truck.

07:42.714 --> 07:46.582
<i>Carrie Castle. I'm a staff reporter
for the Metropolis Journal.</i>

07:47.186 --> 07:49.154
I don't grant interviews, Ms. Castle.

07:49.321 --> 07:52.950
I've spent most of my life taking
back entrances to avoid people like you.

07:53.125 --> 07:56.117
Wait. Just listen.
I want to write an article about you.

07:58.297 --> 08:01.425
That's your pitch? There are articles
written about me all the time.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.400
But you're either dismissed as a wild child
or the spoiled son of Lionel Luthor.

08:05.704 --> 08:07.831
<i>You've gotten some good press
in the Inquisitor...</i>

08:08.006 --> 08:12.909
<i>...but the Journal is not a tabloid. It's
respected. It could help change your image.</i>

08:13.078 --> 08:16.445
- What did you have in mind?
- A cover profile on your work in Smallville.

08:16.615 --> 08:18.139
It will be fair and accurate...

08:18.317 --> 08:21.684
...and will give you the legitimacy you need
to get out of your father's shadow.

08:21.854 --> 08:23.947
Launching my career
and conveniently your own.

08:25.357 --> 08:29.316
I admire the effort, Ms. Castle,
but I have to decline.

08:31.897 --> 08:34.388
You get points for style, though.

08:47.145 --> 08:48.806
I can't believe Pete did this.

08:48.981 --> 08:52.917
Some men are born to greatness, others are
dragged into it, kicking and screaming.

08:53.085 --> 08:55.519
Clark? What's going on?
Why are you running?

08:55.687 --> 08:57.985
You've never shown interest
in student government.

08:58.156 --> 09:00.522
Don't worry, it's just a gag.
Pete nominated me.

09:00.692 --> 09:02.819
- So you're taking your name off the ballot?
- Yeah.

09:02.995 --> 09:06.487
Well, good, because this election
is way too important to turn into a joke.

09:06.665 --> 09:08.257
It's bad enough with Felice.

09:08.433 --> 09:11.994
I hear she's throwing a pre-election bash
with a band and catering.

09:13.538 --> 09:17.907
She is trying to buy this election
like one of her Prada bags!

09:19.144 --> 09:21.806
Talk about tightly wound.

09:21.980 --> 09:25.040
Not that I'm planning to, but if I ran,
you think I'd have a shot?

09:25.250 --> 09:28.651
Yeah, right after I'm elected
head cheerleader.

09:34.159 --> 09:36.252
Clark Kent for president?

09:36.428 --> 09:39.556
Oh, don't worry,
I'm pulling my name out tomorrow.

09:40.098 --> 09:42.123
- I think this is a terrific idea.
- You do?

09:42.301 --> 09:46.761
You always say that you don't get a chance
to shine because football is off-limits...

09:46.939 --> 09:49.464
- ... maybe this is your opportunity.
- I assumed you'd say no.

09:49.641 --> 09:53.634
- Student government is such a public thing.
- It doesn't require you to use your gifts...

09:53.812 --> 09:56.906
...and it's a school activity
you can make your own.

09:57.282 --> 10:00.581
Hey, what's the matter, son?
You don't look too happy about this.

10:00.752 --> 10:02.083
Hey- Hey.

10:03.021 --> 10:05.956
I've always tried to stay
out of the spotlight.

10:06.124 --> 10:08.058
Well, nobody's saying you have to run.

10:08.226 --> 10:11.957
You can quit if you want, but remember,
quitting's a very hard habit to break.

10:14.633 --> 10:16.931
No pressure.

10:26.411 --> 10:28.504
Wow, the place is...

10:28.680 --> 10:29.840
Empty?

10:30.015 --> 10:31.482
Deserted?

10:31.650 --> 10:33.242
Vacant?

10:33.418 --> 10:37.081
Well, I was searching for a euphemism
to say that, but... yeah.

10:37.255 --> 10:40.088
The Beanery's tried to put us
out of business since we opened.

10:40.258 --> 10:43.022
<i>I have tried coupons, price cuts,
even ads in the Ledger...</i>

10:43.195 --> 10:47.393
...so far nothing's worked. At this rate,
we'll have to close the doors in a month.

10:47.566 --> 10:51.002
Have you spoken to Lex?
He's an investor, I'm sure he can help.

10:51.169 --> 10:53.501
He's been uncharacteristically silent.

10:53.672 --> 10:58.609
Besides, this is my battle to win or lose,
and I am determined to win.

10:58.777 --> 11:02.713
Speaking of which, I hear you've got
a battle of your own on your hands.

11:02.881 --> 11:06.044
Oh, yeah, the election.
I'm not really running.

11:06.218 --> 11:09.745
That's too bad. I think
you'd make a great class president.

11:09.921 --> 11:11.354
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:11.523 --> 11:15.186
You're honest, people trust you.
And you have this innate sense of justice.

11:15.360 --> 11:20.024
I can see it on your face how upset you get
when you think somebody's being mistreated.

11:20.198 --> 11:22.860
- You see all that in me?
- Yes, I do.

11:30.709 --> 11:33.007
Clark Kent for president.

11:33.178 --> 11:35.544
How'd you know I was running?

11:35.714 --> 11:38.080
I found this on my windshield in town.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.616
I have an overzealous campaign manager.

11:40.786 --> 11:43.220
I didn't realize you had political aspirations.

11:43.388 --> 11:45.982
I don't. I just figured
I could make a difference.

11:46.158 --> 11:50.185
Did you swing by
for a campaign contribution?

11:50.796 --> 11:53.822
Actually, I was wondering
if you knew about the Talon.

11:53.999 --> 11:56.559
You mean the fact that it's been
empty the last two weeks?

11:56.735 --> 11:59.295
Do you plan on helping Lana out?
She's tried everything.

11:59.471 --> 12:02.531
She's doing an admirable job.

12:03.775 --> 12:05.504
- If the Talon goes under...
- Clark...

12:05.777 --> 12:09.873
...I won't subsidize a money-losing operation.
The Talon has to find its own feet.

12:10.048 --> 12:13.484
Well, you could at least stop by
and show some solidarity.

12:13.652 --> 12:16.849
See? You're already working
for your constituents.

12:17.789 --> 12:20.553
You want some advice?

12:20.725 --> 12:23.421
I think you need a better slogan.

12:24.329 --> 12:26.559
Everybody's used this one, including me.

12:27.632 --> 12:30.533
- You ran for student office.
- Once.

12:30.702 --> 12:33.728
- But my aspirations weren't very noble.
- Did you win?

12:34.106 --> 12:36.472
Of course.

12:36.641 --> 12:38.541
Do you have any tips?

12:38.710 --> 12:42.874
You don't need my methods.
You'll win on your own terms.

12:43.048 --> 12:44.413
Competition's pretty stiff.

12:44.583 --> 12:46.813
There's nothing wrong with a good fight.
Remember...

12:46.985 --> 12:50.785
...the man of tomorrow
is forged by his battles today.

12:52.090 --> 12:55.526
Could I use that? I mean,
"the man of tomorrow," for my slogan?

12:57.229 --> 13:00.027
Knock yourself out.

13:13.812 --> 13:16.975
"Clark Kent, man of tomorrow."
Kind of presumptuous, don't you think?

13:17.149 --> 13:19.549
- I like it.
- I thought you were bagging the election.

13:19.718 --> 13:21.879
I had a change of heart.

13:22.053 --> 13:24.146
"Man of tomorrow."
Very catchy.

13:24.322 --> 13:26.654
Thank you.
And thank you for the encouragement.

13:26.825 --> 13:27.985
You've got my vote.

13:28.160 --> 13:31.323
I could have my election rally
at the Talon, help bring people by.

13:31.496 --> 13:34.659
That sounds great.
You know where to find me.

13:34.833 --> 13:35.993
- Bye, Lana.
- Bye.

13:36.868 --> 13:39.632
You're running because of Lana.
Why am I not surprised?

13:39.804 --> 13:42.136
I'm running because
I think I can do a good job.

13:42.307 --> 13:45.970
- All right, Clark, whatever.
- Pete has faith in me and so does Lana.

13:46.144 --> 13:48.578
- It's interesting that you don't.
- What do you stand for?

13:48.747 --> 13:51.773
I stand for truth, justice
and other stuff.

13:52.150 --> 13:55.642
You wanna be a little more specific,
tell me where you stand on the issues?

13:55.820 --> 13:59.312
- What issues do you wanna talk about?
- There's the plan to cut the arts budget...

13:59.491 --> 14:02.517
...the appalling nutritional value
of cafeteria meals, the dress code...

14:02.694 --> 14:05.959
...and not to mention the student
privacy issues with the locker searches.

14:06.131 --> 14:08.122
Slow down.
I just decided to run last night.

14:08.300 --> 14:12.532
Okay, well, I think the man of tomorrow
needs to get a platform for today.

14:17.042 --> 14:19.909
Okay, there's
a girls' volleyball game this afternoon.

14:20.078 --> 14:22.603
You can make an appearance,
court the jock vote.

14:22.781 --> 14:26.444
Keep Friday clear, there's a band concert.
They suck, but you've got to be seen...

14:26.618 --> 14:28.779
- ... as a friend of the arts.
- What about my platform?

14:28.954 --> 14:31.354
Who cares?
If people like you, they'll vote for you.

14:31.523 --> 14:34.720
- What am I gonna say in my speech?
- I don't know. I don't do speeches.

14:34.893 --> 14:38.329
See you at lunch.
We can canvass the cafeteria.

15:13.932 --> 15:16.799
Who do they think they are?

15:26.778 --> 15:29.110
Stop!

15:31.316 --> 15:33.750
Not now. I have work to do.

16:05.183 --> 16:07.583
Any chance you could help us
hang some posters?

16:07.753 --> 16:10.813
Pete's convinced if he puts my name
on enough wall space, I'll win.

16:10.989 --> 16:15.187
Besides needing to be an impartial member
of the fourth estate, I'm doing my bee story.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.884
C.E.P. find anything new?

16:17.062 --> 16:19.792
The swarms didn't migrate
from any of their usual places.

16:19.965 --> 16:22.525
Beekeepers all over the state
have found their hives empty.

16:22.701 --> 16:24.931
It's like the colonies just up and left.

16:25.103 --> 16:28.937
That's weird. Bees are followers. They
wouldn't desert their hive without reason.

16:30.575 --> 16:33.510
My mom's addicted to Discovery Channel.

16:33.679 --> 16:36.580
- So how goes the platform?
- I haven't started working on it yet.

16:36.748 --> 16:40.184
I've been so busy meeting people.
I even got invited to parties this weekend.

16:40.352 --> 16:44.220
I can't believe it took one day for you to
be compromised by the lure of popularity.

16:44.523 --> 16:47.788
Remind me to pull your funding
after I'm elected.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.485
Speaking of which,
where's the latest edition?

16:50.796 --> 16:53.060
No, no, no!
I'm not done proofing it yet.

16:53.231 --> 16:55.665
You shouldn't be looking at it yet.
It's not done!

16:55.834 --> 16:59.395
Come on, I've been correcting your
comma issues since your first laptop.

17:02.474 --> 17:05.136
- You endorsed Paul?
- Clark, I had to be objective.

17:05.310 --> 17:08.279
Paul's still in the race,
and he'll be back by fall.

17:08.446 --> 17:10.744
It's great that you're all gung-ho
and slogany now...

17:10.915 --> 17:13.885
...but the truth is, you only ran
because Pete suckered you into it.

17:14.051 --> 17:17.282
Paul has a clear stance on issues
you have yet to articulate.

17:17.455 --> 17:20.448
- It's nothing personal.
- I understand, Chloe.

17:33.138 --> 17:36.073
Hey, guys. Taking a break
from the campaign trail?

17:36.541 --> 17:38.941
It's amazing how many people
at school I don't know.

17:39.111 --> 17:42.012
This is a pit stop. Wanted to take
advantage of your two-for-one deal.

17:42.180 --> 17:45.206
Figure that's the last step before
I institute topless waitressing.

17:45.384 --> 17:48.911
Well, here's to hoping it fails miserably.

17:50.322 --> 17:53.849
- It looks like you have customers.
- They're here because Whitney forced them.

17:54.026 --> 17:56.494
Yeah, I passed by the Beanery.
They're kind of busy.

17:56.661 --> 18:01.360
The owner stopped by. He said he's made it
his mission to run this place into the ground.

18:01.533 --> 18:05.526
Then he had the nerve to tell me
that it wasn't personal, just business.

18:05.704 --> 18:07.934
<i>Why does everyone over 40
quote The Godfather?</i>

18:08.106 --> 18:11.598
I don't know, but it's really annoying.

18:11.977 --> 18:15.606
- So how's political life treating you?
- It's definitely a challenge.

18:15.781 --> 18:19.581
- It shows you who your real friends are.
- How's your speech going?

18:19.751 --> 18:23.187
- I haven't started writing it yet.
- Maybe I could help you with that.

18:23.355 --> 18:25.550
- Come by tomorrow. We can work on it.
- Really?

18:26.124 --> 18:28.752
That would be great.
You sure you have enough time?

18:29.061 --> 18:30.426
Look around.

18:30.595 --> 18:35.328
Unless Whitney can coerce the baseball
team, I think I can squeeze you in.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.128
Glad to see business is booming.

18:38.303 --> 18:41.204
It's hard when even
your regular customers blow you off.

18:41.373 --> 18:44.399
I haven't been blowing you off.
I've had my eye on the situation.

18:44.576 --> 18:48.103
- Waiting for me to fail.
- Most new ventures don't make it.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.214
Prepare yourself for that possibility.

18:50.382 --> 18:52.441
- I thought you didn't like to lose.
- I don't.

18:52.617 --> 18:54.084
But it's not my fight.

18:54.252 --> 18:57.710
- You have to know when to cut your losses.
- So, what do you suggest I do?

18:57.889 --> 19:01.347
The Beanery declared war. If you
wanna hold on to this place, get creative.

19:01.526 --> 19:04.086
Be willing to get your hands dirty.

19:04.696 --> 19:07.130
Don't worry, I'm not suggesting
anything illegal.

19:07.299 --> 19:10.063
<i>To quote The Godfather,
"It's time to go to the mattresses."</i>

19:11.503 --> 19:15.371
That movie should be banned
from basic cable.

19:20.579 --> 19:22.740
Don't ask.

19:26.451 --> 19:28.817
All right. Bye.

19:28.987 --> 19:31.387
Felice, can I talk to you a minute?

19:31.556 --> 19:33.956
You've got 55 seconds left. Go.

19:34.126 --> 19:35.923
I've made a decision.

19:36.094 --> 19:38.085
You're planning on dropping out.

19:38.263 --> 19:41.664
No, I've decided you need to drop out.

19:42.701 --> 19:45.465
Trust me, that's not gonna happen.

19:45.637 --> 19:48.333
In case you haven't heard,
I'm the front-runner.

19:48.507 --> 19:52.034
That's because these drones wouldn't know
a qualified candidate if they saw one.

19:52.210 --> 19:54.007
That's the problem with this place.

19:54.279 --> 19:56.713
It's like a hive with two queens.

19:56.982 --> 20:01.544
Well, if you knew anything about nature,
you'd realize one always goes down.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.881
You know what? You're a freak.

20:06.324 --> 20:07.848
Okay, have it your way.

20:08.026 --> 20:11.518
But just remember, I did ask nicely.

20:15.634 --> 20:20.628
- Gabby, you're the best part of my day.
- Thank you, Mr. Luthor.

20:23.141 --> 20:25.439
- You're not Gabby.
- She couldn't make it.

20:25.610 --> 20:28.272
Now would be a good time
for you to leave, Ms. Castle.

20:28.446 --> 20:30.471
Do people always do what you say?

20:30.649 --> 20:32.014
Is that unusual?

20:32.184 --> 20:35.415
I thought you said
you appreciated persistence.

20:35.587 --> 20:39.023
Besides, aren't I doing a good job?

20:39.658 --> 20:42.525
Lucky for you.

20:43.061 --> 20:45.996
It took a while to figure out
what would tempt you...

20:46.164 --> 20:48.724
...and then it hit me.

20:50.435 --> 20:53.268
<i>It's not your picture on the Journal cover
so much as the words...</i>

20:53.438 --> 20:56.601
..."Son Outshines Father" in the caption.

20:56.775 --> 20:58.470
How am I doing?

20:58.643 --> 21:00.838
A little lower.

21:01.012 --> 21:02.479
Let me guess.

21:02.647 --> 21:05.707
Your editor promised you
your own column if you land me.

21:05.884 --> 21:09.513
- You can imagine how appreciative I'd be.
- I think I can.

21:09.688 --> 21:12.919
Tell me, Lex, would you say
my chances are above-average...

21:13.091 --> 21:15.116
...or below?

21:15.293 --> 21:19.252
Like I said, I always appreciate persistence.

21:19.431 --> 21:21.456
You won't regret this.

21:21.633 --> 21:24.227
Not yet, Ms. Castle.

21:24.402 --> 21:27.235
I paid for an hour.

22:01.206 --> 22:02.935
Felice Chandler, what's the problem?

22:19.157 --> 22:20.681
Vote for Clark.

22:20.859 --> 22:23.327
Vote for Clark.

22:25.063 --> 22:28.965
I thought meeting people would be the
worst part, but it's actually kind of fun.

22:29.134 --> 22:33.400
I'm glad you feel that way, because
according to my latest lunchtime poll...

22:33.571 --> 22:35.539
...you've got a shot.

22:36.308 --> 22:37.332
Hey.

22:38.710 --> 22:40.439
Hey.

22:43.615 --> 22:44.604
How's it going?

22:44.783 --> 22:47.946
Just answer "no comment."
That way she can't misquote you.

22:50.221 --> 22:53.122
- You hear about Felice?
- Yeah, I was just at the medical center.

22:53.291 --> 22:57.318
She was stung way worse than Paul.
She's in a coma.

22:58.029 --> 23:00.429
Two candidates attacked in a week.

23:00.598 --> 23:04.193
- It's a pretty freaky coincidence.
- I think we've moved past coincidence.

23:04.469 --> 23:05.868
What do you think's going on?

23:06.037 --> 23:09.734
Remember last year, Sasha's accident,
when she was stung by a hive of bees?

23:10.241 --> 23:12.709
You think because of that,
she's controlling them?

23:17.182 --> 23:18.171
It's a theory.

23:18.350 --> 23:21.751
Yeah, by several leaps and bounds,
but I'll look into it.

23:21.920 --> 23:25.378
In the meantime, watch your back.

23:35.633 --> 23:37.601
I just heard about Felice.

23:37.769 --> 23:39.134
Weird, huh?

23:39.304 --> 23:41.397
Sometimes things just happen for a reason.

23:41.573 --> 23:43.837
She didn't care about this election
as much as me.

23:44.008 --> 23:46.909
She wasn't my favorite person,
but no one deserves that.

23:47.946 --> 23:50.710
Well, the good news is,
you don't have to run anymore.

23:50.882 --> 23:53.908
With Felice gone, the best
thing you can do is let me run things.

23:54.085 --> 23:57.350
What about democracy?
People should have freedom of choice.

23:57.522 --> 23:59.922
Look, Clark, I really need this.

24:00.091 --> 24:02.491
My parents are riding me to win.
They think if I lose...

24:02.660 --> 24:06.323
...I won't get into a good college.
You have other activities. This is my thing.

24:06.498 --> 24:08.989
- Why don't you just drop out?
- I'm sorry.

24:09.167 --> 24:12.364
I have my own reasons to see this through.

24:12.537 --> 24:14.971
You're making a mistake.

24:15.340 --> 24:17.934
That sounded like a threat.

24:19.644 --> 24:23.273
You wouldn't know how those bees wound
up attacking Paul and Felice, would you?

24:23.448 --> 24:25.382
Are you accusing me of something, Clark?

24:25.550 --> 24:30.681
I find it interesting that a swarm of bees
would attack two candidates in this election.

24:30.855 --> 24:33.881
My thoughts are somebody's behind it.

24:47.772 --> 24:49.069
Good start.

24:49.240 --> 24:53.108
My trash bin has three drafts in it. Nothing
I can come up with sounds presidential.

24:53.278 --> 24:55.974
You don't have to sound presidential.
Say what you believe.

24:56.147 --> 25:00.379
- Once you answer that, the rest is easy.
- I've still got a lot of work to do, then.

25:00.552 --> 25:02.452
Not as much as I have here.

25:03.721 --> 25:07.589
I know you're having a tough time, but it's
amazing what you've done with the place.

25:07.759 --> 25:09.886
This was just going to be the start.

25:10.061 --> 25:12.461
My dream was to restore
the old theater completely.

25:12.630 --> 25:15.224
The projector, the screen.
Show old movies.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.766
<i>Just not The Godfather.</i>

25:19.037 --> 25:22.598
Come on, get back to the speech.
You have to decide what you believe in.

25:23.608 --> 25:26.771
I believe in my friends and their dreams.

25:27.078 --> 25:29.638
What if their dreams
come crashing down around them?

25:29.814 --> 25:33.716
Nothing's crashing down around you, Lana,
not while I'm here.

25:33.952 --> 25:35.476
Thanks, Clark.

25:38.723 --> 25:41.248
Did you hear that?

25:42.327 --> 25:45.319
Yeah, it was coming from over there.

25:46.397 --> 25:48.524
And there.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.498
What is it?

25:59.644 --> 26:02.408
Come on! Get in!

26:03.748 --> 26:05.306
- What about you?
- Get down!

27:02.707 --> 27:04.971
I still can't believe
you didn't get stung.

27:05.143 --> 27:07.077
Guess I have tough skin.

27:07.245 --> 27:09.907
The insurance forms are gonna
hurt worse than the stinger.

27:10.081 --> 27:12.208
But I'm fine, thanks to you.

27:13.184 --> 27:15.015
There's Nell.

27:15.186 --> 27:18.815
- I had a really nice time tonight.
- Yeah, we should do this more often.

27:20.325 --> 27:24.159
- You sure you're okay?
- Sorry we didn't get further on your speech.

27:24.329 --> 27:27.196
That's the least of my worries.
Right now, I need to find Sasha.

27:27.365 --> 27:29.196
- Do you think she did this?
- Yes.

27:29.367 --> 27:31.665
I just don't know how
she's controlling the bees.

27:31.836 --> 27:34.464
- You need to call Chloe.
- We're still not really talking.

27:34.639 --> 27:36.732
Can you believe she didn't endorse me?

27:36.908 --> 27:40.366
Well, if I were in her position,
I probably would have done the same thing.

27:40.545 --> 27:44.572
She's just being objective. She endorsed
the person she thought was most qualified.

27:44.749 --> 27:46.239
- Yeah, but still-
- Clark...

27:46.417 --> 27:48.578
...you said you believed in your friends.

27:48.753 --> 27:51.779
She only did what she thought was right.

28:19.717 --> 28:20.706
Chloe.

28:20.885 --> 28:23.183
Lana told me about the Talon.
Thanks for the call.

28:23.354 --> 28:25.652
- Sorry.
- It's all right, I'm not mad.

28:26.758 --> 28:28.055
Chloe...

28:29.994 --> 28:33.521
...I don't hold it against you.
The endorsement, I mean.

28:33.698 --> 28:35.563
Thanks. I could've warned you, though.

28:37.035 --> 28:39.401
I just don't like being in a fight with you.

28:39.570 --> 28:42.733
Yeah, it wasn't my favorite part either.

28:44.275 --> 28:48.234
Everything has changed in my life
in the last year, with my parents...

28:48.413 --> 28:50.643
...with Lana.

28:51.916 --> 28:55.352
The only thing constant has been you.
I'm glad for that, Chloe.

28:58.456 --> 28:59.980
Me too.

29:06.397 --> 29:08.456
This feels like honey.

29:08.633 --> 29:11.466
Yeah, that's what you usually
find in a hive.

29:13.604 --> 29:15.435
Don't tell me Sasha did all this.

29:15.606 --> 29:17.801
No, her worker bees did.

29:17.975 --> 29:21.536
- How is she controlling them?
- I think she's emitting something called...

29:21.713 --> 29:24.511
...the queen mandibular pheromone.

29:24.682 --> 29:27.116
She pick that up
when she fell in the hive?

29:27.285 --> 29:29.480
She was stung over a thousand times.

29:29.654 --> 29:33.954
They were Africanized bees. Doctors didn't
hold out hope, because she was allergic.

29:34.125 --> 29:36.355
How do they account
for the miracle recovery?

29:36.527 --> 29:38.290
They don't. And neither could I...

29:38.463 --> 29:41.227
...until I found out
the accident happened in Shuster's Gorge.

29:41.399 --> 29:44.800
- That's the deepest crater in town.
- Yeah. You do the meteorite math.

29:44.969 --> 29:47.130
The bees did something
to make her their queen.

29:47.305 --> 29:49.466
All the bees in the state
are taking a cue from her.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.904
They're helping her make
Smallville High her hive.

29:52.076 --> 29:55.409
If she doesn't like the way the vote goes,
it won't be a pretty sight.

29:55.580 --> 29:57.980
Neither will she.
Bees are only loyal to a point.

29:58.149 --> 30:01.346
Once she loses control, her scent will
change, and the bees will know.

30:01.519 --> 30:03.487
They won't be happy.

30:10.261 --> 30:13.355
Thought you wanted
to meet somewhere private.

30:13.531 --> 30:16.967
Lately this has been passing for that.

30:18.503 --> 30:21.870
Thanks for agreeing to see me.
I just want to get a few more quotes.

30:22.039 --> 30:24.473
How's the article going?

30:24.642 --> 30:26.735
People are gonna see you
in a whole new light.

30:26.911 --> 30:28.811
Yes, I bet they will.

30:28.980 --> 30:32.245
- I've had a chance to read the rough draft.
- Where'd you get that?

30:32.416 --> 30:36.284
I have my sources. It's hardly
the flattering expose you promised.

30:36.454 --> 30:39.685
- It's fair and accurate.
- You twisted everything I said.

30:39.857 --> 30:42.621
My journalism professor says,
"If you wanna bring down Goliath...

30:42.794 --> 30:45.922
...you better know his Achilles heel."
Yours is your ego.

30:47.365 --> 30:50.596
I see they like to mix metaphors
at East Tennessee Community College.

30:50.835 --> 30:53.963
Am I supposed to be scared
because you ran a background check on me?

30:54.138 --> 30:57.107
- I have nothing to hide.
- How much did my father pay you?

30:57.308 --> 31:00.368
- You really are paranoid.
- Why else would you sandbag me?

31:00.545 --> 31:03.446
I plan on making a name for myself
as a hard-hitting journalist...

31:03.614 --> 31:06.777
...and you're a very visible target.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.418
What's it gonna take
to make this article go away?

31:11.589 --> 31:15.491
<i>Unlike your whore at the Inquisitor,
I'm not for sale.</i>

31:17.762 --> 31:20.196
Goodbye, Lex.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.766
Thanks for being my first.

31:48.125 --> 31:50.423
You wanted to see me?

31:50.595 --> 31:52.927
I've decided to drop out of the election.

31:53.097 --> 31:56.032
I thought you should be the first to know.

31:56.267 --> 32:00.067
Good. I'm glad you finally
made the right decision.

32:00.238 --> 32:04.072
The fact that those people even considered
voting for any of you guys just proves...

32:04.242 --> 32:07.575
...that this school needs a strong leader.
Now they'll have one.

32:07.745 --> 32:09.736
You'll do anything
to make sure that happens...

32:09.914 --> 32:13.372
...including putting your opponents
in the hospital.

32:15.586 --> 32:18.521
I see what this is.
You haven't dropped out at all.

32:20.591 --> 32:22.889
- I know you're behind the attacks.
- So?

32:23.060 --> 32:26.029
What are you going to do, Clark?
Even if the police believe you...

32:26.197 --> 32:29.394
...they can't stop me. No one can.

32:30.935 --> 32:32.027
Try me.

32:33.137 --> 32:36.300
That's what you want, isn't it?
That's why you lured me here.

32:39.243 --> 32:41.677
What were you gonna do, Clark?

32:51.255 --> 32:53.382
What are you doing?

32:53.658 --> 32:56.559
Teaching you that politics
is all about sacrifice.

32:58.963 --> 33:00.430
Where are you sending them?

33:00.598 --> 33:04.329
You may be thick-skinned,
but what about your mother?

34:07.365 --> 34:09.958
- Mom, you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

34:10.134 --> 34:13.728
I've never seen bees attack like that.

34:14.205 --> 34:16.867
Where do you think they went?

34:27.819 --> 34:30.617
How'd you get here?
What about your mom?

34:30.788 --> 34:33.154
My mom's fine.

34:33.324 --> 34:34.348
It's over, Sasha.

34:34.525 --> 34:36.891
No, it's not.
I still have a speech to make.

34:37.061 --> 34:40.393
If you try and stop me, I'll be
in front of an auditorium full of people...

34:40.565 --> 34:43.193
- ... and you know what I can do to them.
- You have to stop.

34:43.367 --> 34:46.699
- No election is worth hurting people.
- I have to win, Clark.

34:46.871 --> 34:50.500
My parents said there are two kinds of
people in the world: leaders and followers.

34:50.675 --> 34:52.973
And they expect for me to be a leader.
And that-

34:57.949 --> 35:00.850
- You have to stop the bees.
- I didn't tell them to come back.

35:03.321 --> 35:05.016
Ow! What's happening?

35:05.623 --> 35:08.114
You have to help me!
I'm allergic to bees!

35:08.559 --> 35:11.289
Don't let them kill me!

36:11.055 --> 36:13.888
Let's get you to a hospital.

36:21.966 --> 36:25.993
I can't believe Felice and Sasha
both dropped out and you still lost.

36:26.170 --> 36:28.434
- Where did I go wrong?
- You ran a good campaign.

36:28.606 --> 36:34.511
We had fun, met some new people, and
we have enough T-shirts to last a lifetime.

36:34.846 --> 36:37.371
<i>- Please tell me that's not for the Torch.
- It's for Paul.</i>

36:37.548 --> 36:42.713
Since he couldn't attend his own victory
party, he asked me to take pictures.

36:42.887 --> 36:46.721
Chloe, you were right to endorse him.
He was the more qualified candidate...

36:46.891 --> 36:49.655
...and I got caught up
in the whole popularity rush.

36:49.827 --> 36:51.761
Don't gloat just because your guy won.

36:51.929 --> 36:54.489
Well, my candidate may have won,
but my friend lost.

36:54.665 --> 36:57.327
- I'm really proud of you tonight, Clark.
- Why?

36:57.501 --> 37:00.061
Because you're exhibiting
dignity in the face of defeat.

37:00.238 --> 37:03.730
It's the quality
that all great leaders possess.

37:08.679 --> 37:12.206
- Nice crowd.
- We'll be having more nights like this.

37:12.383 --> 37:13.975
How can you be so sure?

37:14.151 --> 37:17.484
Let's just say I went to the mattresses.

37:17.989 --> 37:20.890
<i>Check out page three
of the Ledger tomorrow.</i>

37:21.058 --> 37:23.618
Can you give me a preview?

37:23.794 --> 37:28.197
Apparently, a rival coffeehouse has
had several health-department violations...

37:28.366 --> 37:31.130
- ... they've been trying to cover up.
- How'd you hear about that?

37:31.402 --> 37:34.894
A vendor told me. So Chloe
had a reporter friend look into it.

37:35.072 --> 37:38.098
And sure enough, it's true.

37:39.110 --> 37:41.840
Very creative. I'm impressed.

37:49.287 --> 37:52.450
Hey, sorry about the election.

37:52.623 --> 37:56.024
My father says you learn
more about yourself when you lose.

37:56.193 --> 38:00.061
- What did you learn?
- I'm not destined to be a politician.

38:00.531 --> 38:02.692
You need two different personalities.

38:02.867 --> 38:06.462
You don't need to be an elected official
to change the world, Clark.

38:06.637 --> 38:10.368
- You ever thought about getting into politics?
- Someday I'd like to be president.

38:11.175 --> 38:13.871
In that case,
you can have your slogan back.

38:14.045 --> 38:16.309
It's okay, you can keep it.

38:23.821 --> 38:25.948
Ms. Castle...

38:26.123 --> 38:28.057
...thank you for coming.

38:28.225 --> 38:32.161
I should probably know better,
but I had to hear this.

38:32.330 --> 38:37.393
You won't mind if I record our conversation,
for both of our protection?

38:37.568 --> 38:38.899
Feel free.

38:39.070 --> 38:42.369
I only asked you here to congratulate you.

38:43.941 --> 38:45.704
The truth is, I'm impressed.

38:45.876 --> 38:49.437
Few people have caught me
with my guard down.

38:50.047 --> 38:53.380
Let me guess. This is where you try
and blackmail me to change my story?

38:53.551 --> 38:56.850
I wouldn't dream of blackmailing you
or making you change a word.

38:57.254 --> 39:00.917
My father says it's when they stop
talking about you that you should worry.

39:01.092 --> 39:03.686
- Then I guess we're settled.
- On the other hand...

39:03.861 --> 39:07.820
<i>...it turns out there's an opening
for managing editor at the Journal.</i>

39:10.501 --> 39:12.093
I work there.

39:12.269 --> 39:16.729
- If there was an opening, I would know.
- We don't know the same people.

39:16.907 --> 39:20.866
You could run your fair and balanced
article word-for-word if you'd like.

39:21.045 --> 39:24.344
Or you could show up to work tomorrow
and walk into a corner office.

39:24.515 --> 39:27.313
- The choice is yours.
- What's the catch?

39:27.485 --> 39:30.215
No catch. Well, maybe one.

39:30.388 --> 39:34.722
If someone ever tries to blackmail you,
now you'll have something to hide.

39:36.193 --> 39:39.356
I don't know if you're better or worse
than your father.

39:39.530 --> 39:41.998
What will you say when he sees
you killed the article?

39:42.166 --> 39:45.158
- Who says he's behind it?
- Please, Ms. Castle...

39:45.336 --> 39:49.568
...I've never insulted your intelligence,
don't insult mine.

39:50.775 --> 39:54.711
I'll tell him I got an offer
I couldn't refuse.

40:15.499 --> 40:17.558
Packing up campaign headquarters?

40:17.735 --> 40:19.635
Yeah, it's back to just being a barn.

40:19.804 --> 40:22.364
Sorry we couldn't talk more at the Talon.
It was packed.

40:22.540 --> 40:24.974
It looked better that way.

40:26.710 --> 40:30.202
- I'd assume that was a good thing.
- It is. It's just...

40:30.381 --> 40:33.612
I'm not sure I liked what I did,
playing dirty with the Beanery.

40:33.784 --> 40:35.649
Maybe the mattress isn't for you.

40:35.820 --> 40:38.880
I had to choose between doing
the right thing and being successful.

40:39.056 --> 40:42.389
The weird part is,
I kind of enjoyed being underhanded.

40:42.560 --> 40:46.792
Lana Lang seduced by the dark side?
Who would've thunk?

40:48.399 --> 40:51.129
Don't worry, we all get caught up.

40:51.368 --> 40:55.828
I got so caught up in the popularity thing
I almost forgot why I ran.

40:58.175 --> 41:00.939
Did you ever finish your speech?

41:01.278 --> 41:04.008
Yeah. Not that anyone will ever hear it.

41:04.615 --> 41:07.015
- I could hear it.
- Yeah? When?

41:07.418 --> 41:09.579
Now.

41:10.387 --> 41:12.719
- Right now?
- Yes, Clark.

41:14.825 --> 41:17.988
Speech, speech, speech!

41:31.976 --> 41:35.844
Nobody thinks that a class president
can make a difference, but I disagree.

41:36.013 --> 41:39.039
If we want to change the world,
first we have to change ourselves.

41:39.216 --> 41:42.583
My father always says that you learn
life lessons whether you win or lose...

41:42.753 --> 41:47.087
...so I hope that my worthy running mates
will work alongside me...
