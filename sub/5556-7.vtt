00:15.500 --> 00:18.450
The Doctor will save me.
The Doctor will save me...

00:18.500 --> 00:21.500
Excuse me, I'm going to need my inhaler.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.450
Any second now, you're going
to stop that countdown.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.450
Both of you. Together.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.450
And then you're going to negotiate
the most perfect treaty of all time.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.450
Safeguards all round,
completely fair on both sides.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.450
- And the key to perfect negotiation?
- Not knowing what side you're on.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.450
So, for the next few hours,
until we decide to let you out...

00:40.500 --> 00:43.450
No-one in this room will be able
to remember if they're human...

00:43.500 --> 00:45.900
.. or Zygon. Whoops-a-daisy!

00:55.500 --> 00:58.500
Cancel the detonation!

01:01.500 --> 01:03.450
Hello.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.450
Hello.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.450
- Do you want to...?
- No, you can, if you...

01:06.500 --> 01:09.450
Shall we do it together?

01:09.500 --> 01:12.450
- Operation Double.
- The Zygon peace treaty.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.450
- I'm Osgood.
- I'm also Osgood.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.450
Remember that. It'll be important later.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.450
Operation Double is a covert operation,

01:19.500 --> 01:22.450
outside of normal UNIT strictures,
to resettle and rehouse

01:22.500 --> 01:26.450
- an alien race in secrecy on planet Earth.
- With UNIT's help,

01:26.500 --> 01:29.450
20 million Zygons have been
allowed to take human form,

01:29.500 --> 01:32.450
been dispersed around the world,
and are now living amongst us.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.450
We're making this in case
something goes wrong.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.450
In case UNIT is infiltrated.

01:36.500 --> 01:39.450
In case something occurs
to unmask the Zygons.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.170
Or in case one or both of us dies.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.450
The Zygons are a peaceful race.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.450
Their shape-changing ability
should not be considered a weapon.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.450
It's a survival mechanism.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.450
They embed themselves in other cultures,

02:00.500 --> 02:04.450
and live out their lives in their
new bodies in peace and harmony...

02:04.500 --> 02:05.450
mainly.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.449
Any race is capable of
the best and the worst.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.450
Every race is peaceful and warlike.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.450
- Good and evil.
- My race is no exception.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.450
And neither is mine.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.450
If one Zygon goes rogue...

02:17.500 --> 02:18.450
Or one human...

02:18.500 --> 02:21.100
.. then the ceasefire will break.

02:23.500 --> 02:27.450
- That's why the Doctor left us this.
- He called it the Osgood Box.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.450
If you've been paying attention,
you'll be able to guess why.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.450
- This is the last resort.
- The final sanction.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.450
Pray this box is never needed.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.450
Because if it is, that means
the ceasefire is breaking...

02:37.500 --> 02:39.450
And with 20 million shape-changing Zygons

02:39.500 --> 02:41.450
dispersed around the world...

02:41.500 --> 02:44.170
.. that is the Nightmare Scenario.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.450
Ah!

05:06.500 --> 05:09.450
Come on, kids, no pushing!

05:15.500 --> 05:19.450
'Hi, this is Clara Oswald.
I'm probably on the Tube

05:19.500 --> 05:22.300
'or in outer space. Leave a message!'

05:22.500 --> 05:24.450
Hello, it's Doctor Disco.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.450
I'm in the 21st century.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.450
I don't know what month.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.450
I'm staking out some of the most
dangerous creatures imaginable.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.450
Operating under deep cover.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.450
Trying not to attract suspicion.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.450
Give me a call, Clara. Nightmare Scenario.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.450
I'm worried.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.450
OK. Hey, Monster High and Cinderella.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.500
Down off the monkey bars.
Listen to me. We've got to talk.

05:52.450 --> 05:53.450
Get me Colonel Walsh.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.450
And I need you to coordinate
the Operation Double locations.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.450
There are 20 million Zygons!

05:58.500 --> 06:01.450
And most of the data was with...

06:01.500 --> 06:02.700
her.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.450
Do what you can. Start with any
that have intelligence flags

06:09.500 --> 06:11.700
from the past six months.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
Walsh coming through.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.450
- Walsh. Turmezistan.
- Any new arrivals?

06:19.500 --> 06:22.240
One. The pictures aren't very good.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.040
Can you zoom in on the prisoner?

06:28.450 --> 06:29.450
It's her.

06:29.500 --> 06:33.450
Get into her files. We have to
assume they've been compromised.

06:33.500 --> 06:37.500
Too late. The encryption
system's already been hacked.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.440
And they've sent through another video.

06:43.450 --> 06:44.450
Look, I admire you, OK?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.450
I think you're ingenious --

06:46.500 --> 06:49.450
pretending to be a couple of
seven-year-olds is a splendid way

06:49.500 --> 06:50.450
to conceal your blobbiness.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.450
But let's not pretend.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.450
You're very blobby.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.450
In fact, you two are the big blobs.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.500
And you are not patrolling the ceasefire.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.900
Fine. Fine, bury your heads.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.450
Listen to me. Listen!

07:07.500 --> 07:09.450
There are other factions.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.450
I know that there are other
blobby factions you don't control.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.450
They're planning something.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.450
And if we don't get together and stop it,

07:17.500 --> 07:20.450
it'll be the end of this. Of all of you.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.450
This is our jurisdiction, Doctor.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.450
These are our creatures. We
are close to finding them.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.450
They are our children, and
we will deal with them.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.450
Your kids are out of control.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.450
I'm taking this out of your hands.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.500
Don't even think about going anywhere.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.450
Are you phoning me with
your backside again,

07:39.500 --> 07:41.450
or are you really sending
me a distress signal?

07:41.500 --> 07:43.450
I'm really sending you a distress signal.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.450
They've kidnapped Osgood and
they've stolen the location

07:46.500 --> 07:48.450
of every Zygon on Earth.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.240
Doctor, the ceasefire's broken down.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.450
Hey! Away! Away!

07:56.500 --> 07:57.450
Get those kids out of the way!

07:57.500 --> 08:00.450
Out of the way! Out of
the way! Out of the way!

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
Move! Out of the way!

08:22.500 --> 08:27.500
UNIT troops will be destroyed
wherever they are in the world.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.450
The enemies of our race will be destroyed

08:31.500 --> 08:32.450
wherever they are in the world.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.500
The war is about to begin.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.570
There will be truth...

08:43.500 --> 08:46.100
.. or there will be consequences.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.450
'Hi, this is Clara Oswald.
I'm probably on the Tube

08:58.500 --> 09:01.450
'or in outer space. Leave a message!'

09:01.500 --> 09:03.100
Call me now.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.450
'Hello, it's Doctor Disco...'

09:27.500 --> 09:29.450
Hello. Oh, hello.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.450
Sandeep, hello.

09:31.500 --> 09:35.450
- You OK?
- I can't find my mummy and daddy.

09:35.500 --> 09:39.500
Well, why don't you wait here, and
I can go see if I can find them?

09:48.500 --> 09:49.770
Hello?

09:57.500 --> 09:59.500
Hello?

10:11.500 --> 10:13.450
Oh, sorry -- erm,

10:13.500 --> 10:16.450
your little boy is out there.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.500
He couldn't find you.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.500
Daddy's here!

10:26.500 --> 10:28.450
We can take him.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.500
- Is... Is he OK?
- Everything's fine.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.500
Did you just call yourself "Doctor Disco"?

11:09.500 --> 11:12.450
This is where the Zygon High
Command had their secret base.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.450
A junior school?

11:14.500 --> 11:17.450
Terms of the settlement,
Operation Double, were these --

11:17.500 --> 11:19.450
20 million Zygons, the entire hatchery,

11:19.500 --> 11:21.450
were allowed to be born
and to stay on Earth.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.450
They were permitted to
permanently take up the form

11:24.500 --> 11:26.450
of the nearest available
human beings -- in this case,

11:26.500 --> 11:29.450
a large percentage of the
population of the UK.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.450
You left us with an
impossible situation, Doctor.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.040
Yes, I know. It's called peace.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.500
What about the two little girl commanders?

11:40.450 --> 11:41.450
Weren't they helping you?

11:41.500 --> 11:44.450
They've been almost impossible
to deal with since Osgood left.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.450
Secretive, uncommunicative.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.450
We've known there's something
going on -- some radicalisation,

11:49.500 --> 11:53.450
some revolution in the younger brood.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.240
They said they had it under control.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.450
The Zygon command centre.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.450
That's the control polyp
for all Zygons on Earth.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.500
It's horrible.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.440
Could you...? Would you mind? Thank you.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.450
If this has been compromised,

12:29.500 --> 12:31.450
the Zygons are wide open.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.900
They'll be starting to panic.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.370
Starting to worry.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.450
Doctor, do you want to
be alone with that thing?

12:41.500 --> 12:43.450
It's a command computer.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.500
You operate it by titivating the fronds.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.450
Are you enjoying that?!

12:49.500 --> 12:52.450
I snogged a Zygon once. Old habits...

12:53.500 --> 12:55.450
Still got the old magic.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.450
So, Osgood's been kidnapped,
right? I thought Osgood was dead.

12:58.500 --> 13:01.450
There've always been two of
her, ever since the ceasefire.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.450
- We never knew which one was real.
- Both of them.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.450
- OK, which one was Zygon.
- Both of them.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.450
They would have maintained a live link --

13:07.500 --> 13:10.450
they were both Zygon and
human at the same time.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.450
They not only administered the
peace, they were the peace.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.450
When the other Osgood died,

13:15.500 --> 13:18.450
the survivor went pretty
much mad with grief.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.450
Then she just disappeared --
went undercover in the States.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.240
Now, of course, the rebels have her.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.450
Ah! OK.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.450
Zygons hatched and dispersed all over --

13:31.500 --> 13:33.450
but something's gone wrong.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.450
Mexico border, North Asia,

13:36.500 --> 13:39.450
West Africa, Australia...

13:39.500 --> 13:41.450
Panic. Paranoia.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.450
What would happen if
they knew who we were?

13:44.500 --> 13:47.500
We've received another video.

13:51.500 --> 13:55.450
That's the Zygon High Command.
It's Jemima and Claudette.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.450
We have been betrayed.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.450
We were sold.

14:00.500 --> 14:04.450
Our rights were violated.

14:04.500 --> 14:09.450
We demand the right to be ourselves.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.450
Normalise.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.500
Normalise!

14:29.500 --> 14:34.450
We are now the Zygon High Command.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.450
All traitors will die.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.500
Truth or consequences.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.450
So, we have a Zygon
revolution on our hands.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.450
- We need to open negotiations.
- I'm not negotiating with them.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.450
As far as they're concerned,
everyone's a traitor.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.450
If you're not going to negotiate,
what are you going to do?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.450
They're holed up in this
settlement in Turmezistan --

14:59.500 --> 15:02.450
it's where they've taken Osgood. I'm
going to order Colonel Walsh to bomb it.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.450
Isn't there a solution that
doesn't involve bombing everyone?

15:05.500 --> 15:08.450
The treaty's been comprehensively
violated, Doctor.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.450
This is a splinter group. The rest
of the Zygons, the vast majority --

15:11.500 --> 15:13.450
they want to live in peace.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.450
You start bombing them,
you'll radicalise the lot.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.500
That's exactly what the
splinter group wants.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.450
"Truth or consequences" --
what exactly does that mean?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.450
It's just the usual kind of nonsense
these idiots call themselves.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.450
- It's in New Mexico.
- What?

15:28.500 --> 15:31.450
It's a town in New Mexico
-- Truth or Consequences.

15:31.500 --> 15:35.450
They renamed it after a TV
show, for a bet or something.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.450
It's a Trivial Pursuit question.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.450
I used to memorise Trivial
Pursuit questions so I could win.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.450
That's the last place we received
signal from Osgood's phone,

15:43.500 --> 15:45.450
isn't it? New Mexico.

15:45.500 --> 15:49.450
OK. Kate Stewart, no bombs for
you. Go to Truth or Consequences.

15:49.500 --> 15:53.450
See what you can find out. The
Doctor will go to Turmezistan.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.450
Negotiate peace, rescue
Osgood, and prevent this war,

15:56.500 --> 15:58.450
cos that's what he does.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.450
Clara, Jac -- you stay here.
This is your country --

16:01.500 --> 16:03.450
protect it from the scary monsters.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.450
- And also from the Zygons.
- Fine.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.450
Oh, and do you still have
the presidential aircraft?

16:09.500 --> 16:12.450
I thought you didn't like
being President of the World.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.700
No, but I like poncing
about in a big plane.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.450
How many troops do you have?

16:26.500 --> 16:27.450
Not many.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.450
Usually on bigger cases we can
draft in from the regular army.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.450
We can't do that now.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.450
The secrecy of the project
has to be maintained.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.450
You got any snazzy weapons?

16:37.500 --> 16:39.450
There was an attempted
Zygon invasion before,

16:39.500 --> 16:41.450
in the '70s, '80s.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.450
One of our staff was a naval surgeon.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.450
Worked at Porton Down
on the captured Zygons.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.450
Developed Z-67.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.450
It's a nerve gas. Unravels their DNA.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.450
Basically, turns them inside out.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.450
Where do you keep it?

16:55.500 --> 16:57.450
We don't. It was taken --

16:57.500 --> 17:00.450
- the formula, the lot.
- Who took it?

17:00.500 --> 17:02.640
Somebody with a Tardis.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.450
They're ready for you, ma'am.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.450
Keep in touch.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.500
Oh, I just need to swing by
home and grab a couple of things.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.170
Yeah, course.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.500
Quick, before someone sees us!

17:43.500 --> 17:47.500
It's really slow. We can
catch them. (Come on!)

18:02.500 --> 18:06.100
- It's slower than usual.
- What's wrong with it?

18:10.500 --> 18:14.500
- Is there a cellar, or somewhere
else they could've gone? - No.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.370
Ugh, what is that?

18:49.500 --> 18:50.970
No, don't!

19:48.500 --> 19:51.500
I think we need to get
some reinforcements.

20:20.500 --> 20:24.450
Approaching target at 1-00-65-12.
Confirm strike order.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.300
Order confirmed.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.450
At ease.

20:29.500 --> 20:32.040
I'm the President of the World.

20:32.450 --> 20:33.450
I'm here to rescue people

20:33.500 --> 20:36.450
and generally establish
happiness all over the place.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.450
The Doctor. Doctor Funkenstein.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.450
- Yes, we know who you are.
- Going to strike altitude.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.500
What's going on here?

20:44.500 --> 20:46.500
Fun and games?

20:48.500 --> 20:52.450
We're 700 metres lower, 700
metres lower than planned. Over.

20:52.500 --> 20:56.450
You're not bombing that town. That's
where they're holding my friend.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.450
They're dangerous. And your
friend is almost certainly dead.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.450
I'm not going to allow them to disperse.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.450
You can't track a shape-shifter.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.500
Visual on the target.

21:07.450 --> 21:08.450
Confirm strike.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.900
Colonel!

21:12.500 --> 21:14.240
Confirm strike.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.500
Confirm strike!

21:28.450 --> 21:29.450
Confirm strike.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.450
Confirm strike!

21:31.500 --> 21:34.040
Strike aborted. Strike aborted.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.700
Well, that's interesting.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.770
Hello?

23:41.500 --> 23:43.500
Hello?

24:14.500 --> 24:16.300
You one of them?

24:17.500 --> 24:19.450
I'm a friend. I've come to help.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.450
Alone?

24:21.500 --> 24:24.450
Have you come to help alone?

24:24.500 --> 24:26.440
What happened here?

24:27.500 --> 24:29.900
You must have brought backup.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.450
Where's your backup?

24:33.500 --> 24:36.600
- Tell me!
- First, tell me why I need it.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.450
We think it's a Zygon training camp.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.450
We never see more than one or two
of them outside at any one time.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.450
But they always take different shapes --
we don't know how many there really are.

24:48.500 --> 24:51.450
We don't know how they come and go
-- whether they go through tunnels,

24:51.500 --> 24:54.450
or whether they turn into dogs
and run out across the hills.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.450
So, that's what we'll find out.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.450
We should have that gas.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.450
We should be able to rip them inside out.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.450
Colonel, take it easy. They're
trying to unsettle you.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.450
They're trying to make
you paranoid and panicked.

25:06.500 --> 25:10.450
Any living thing in this world,
including my family and friends,

25:10.500 --> 25:13.450
could turn into a Zygon and
kill me, any second now.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.100
It's not paranoia when it's real.

25:27.450 --> 25:28.450
I've been looking into this.

25:28.500 --> 25:32.450
There have been reports all over
London of strange activity in lifts.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.450
I've patched into CCTV
from Scotland Yard --

25:35.500 --> 25:37.450
all the elevators I can find.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.450
Now, this is SOAS.

25:39.500 --> 25:43.450
People dragging bundles.
They go down, down, down,

25:43.500 --> 25:46.040
a few minutes go by. And then...

25:47.450 --> 25:48.450
.. they're all gone.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.500
There is something very wrong
happening underneath London.

25:57.500 --> 26:00.450
The Brits came two years ago.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.450
We didn't want them. They just...

26:02.500 --> 26:04.450
They just turned up.

26:04.500 --> 26:07.450
No jobs. Nowhere to live. No money.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.450
And they were... They were odd.

26:10.500 --> 26:13.450
They started getting into fights.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.450
Couple of them got killed.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.500
More than a couple. What happened here?

26:19.500 --> 26:23.450
After the murders, they
started banding together.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.500
And then, one day, one of them changed.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.450
Changed?

26:29.500 --> 26:31.450
One of them was walking down West Main,

26:31.500 --> 26:32.450
and suddenly,

26:32.500 --> 26:34.500
it turned into a...

26:37.500 --> 26:39.170
.. a reptile.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.450
They just came for us.

26:43.500 --> 26:47.450
They turned into monsters
and they CAME for us.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.450
And we couldn't fight them.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.700
You can't tell who's who.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.500
They can turn your own family against you.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.450
Have you seen her?

26:58.500 --> 27:01.450
Yeah, she was here. She was at
the motel, asking questions.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.500
Before...

27:05.500 --> 27:07.900
- Everybody's gone.
- Where?

27:14.500 --> 27:17.450
'OK, listen carefully.
Once we get to the village

27:17.500 --> 27:20.500
'we have a 30-minute window
before the airstrike.'

27:36.500 --> 27:38.450
We all know what a rabbit
warren this place is,

27:38.500 --> 27:41.450
but we've got intel they're
holed up inside the church.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.450
Hitchley, you take the front,
storm it, draw their fire,

27:44.500 --> 27:48.500
- the Doctor and I will take the back.
- This is our object.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.040
We need to get her back. Safely.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.450
Try to kill as few of them as possible,

27:54.500 --> 27:57.450
I need have to have
someone to negotiate with.

27:57.500 --> 28:01.500
You know what they're capable
of. Do not fall victim to it.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.500
- Truck open. Code Green.
- Let's move out!

28:45.500 --> 28:47.450
Come out! Throw down your weapons!

28:47.500 --> 28:51.500
Come out! We have you surrounded!

28:52.500 --> 28:54.500
COME OUT OF THERE!

29:00.500 --> 29:03.500
Come out, we have you surrounded!

29:06.500 --> 29:10.450
I don't have any weapons. Please.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.450
Take aim. On my command.

29:12.500 --> 29:16.450
No. No, don't, please.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.450
Johnny...

29:18.500 --> 29:20.450
you don't understand.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.450
You're not my mother, don't use my name.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.450
They took us here.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.450
They came to the house and took us.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.450
They took your sister.

29:30.500 --> 29:33.450
- Me.
- Stay where you are.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.450
It's not us who are the impostors.

29:36.500 --> 29:39.450
Don't let them trick you.

29:39.500 --> 29:44.450
It's your commanders, your
chief -- they're the aliens.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.450
'Do not fall victim!'

29:46.500 --> 29:48.450
Ask her some details. She's a copy --

29:48.500 --> 29:50.450
ask something only your mum could know.

29:50.500 --> 29:55.450
- Mom, I'm going to have to ask you
some questions. - Don't do this.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.450
You know it's me.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.450
Don't let them trick you.

29:59.500 --> 30:02.450
- Date and place of my birth.
- They brought us here,

30:02.500 --> 30:05.450
they're using us against you.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.450
I'm scared.

30:07.500 --> 30:11.450
Please, I'm so scared.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.450
Name of my favourite teddy bear.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.450
I don't remember.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.450
I'm sorry, I don't.

30:18.500 --> 30:22.450
Don't kill me because I can't remember!

30:22.500 --> 30:23.970
Hitchley!

30:34.500 --> 30:36.450
Stay back!

30:36.500 --> 30:38.450
All of you, stay back from them!

30:38.500 --> 30:41.450
That is not your mother,
it's an alien hostile.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.450
We're not those creatures, we're hostages.

30:44.500 --> 30:45.450
Kill it!

30:45.500 --> 30:48.450
I can prove it. I can prove who we are.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.450
Just come inside, I'll show you.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.450
Don't go in there.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.450
- Please.
- You're not my mom!

30:55.500 --> 31:00.450
Oh, God, you're going to kill me.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.450
Mom, please...

31:01.500 --> 31:05.500
You are, you're going to kill me.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.500
I love you.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.900
I forgive you and I love you.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.500
Do it!

31:25.500 --> 31:28.450
- What proof? - Don't go in
there, you're going to your death!

31:28.500 --> 31:32.450
- Hitchley, kill it.
- Let's go.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.500
Over and out, ma'am.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.840
Dammit.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.450
DAMMIT!

31:40.500 --> 31:43.500
This is pointless! Just
let me go in and talk!

32:00.500 --> 32:02.450
They've executed my men.

32:02.500 --> 32:05.450
Where are the Zygons?

32:05.500 --> 32:07.450
We need to bomb the
hell out of this place.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.450
It's INFESTED with these things.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.450
We can't tell who the enemy is any more,

32:11.500 --> 32:13.450
we can't count them and
we can't track them!

32:13.500 --> 32:15.450
I'm not going to let you do that.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.450
I just lost my men,

32:17.500 --> 32:19.450
I'll quite happily bomb
the hell out of anywhere.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.450
We need to move. Strike's on its way.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.500
- I need to find Osgood.
- You've got ten minutes.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.500
- Help! Help!
- Osgood!

32:38.500 --> 32:40.450
- Osgood!
- Doctor!

32:40.500 --> 32:42.450
- Osgood!
- Doctor, I'm here!

32:42.500 --> 32:44.450
Osgood!

32:44.500 --> 32:46.500
I'm down here!

32:48.500 --> 32:50.500
- Osgood!
- Doctor!

33:01.500 --> 33:03.450
Doctor!

33:03.500 --> 33:05.500
- Doctor!
- Osgood!

33:09.500 --> 33:12.450
Got to get you out. They're
going to bomb this place.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.450
What do the Zygons want?

33:14.500 --> 33:18.450
They're training, practising new skills
-- doctor what are you doing here?

33:18.500 --> 33:21.450
Rescuing you. In quite a
dashing way, I might add.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.450
They fled through the tunnels.
They're going back to the UK.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.450
If you're here, they've got you out
of the way. Who's left in the UK?

33:27.500 --> 33:30.500
- Clara.
- Clara!

33:31.500 --> 33:33.450
Oh, hello.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.450
They've started.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.900
So much for "ten minutes"(!)

33:49.500 --> 33:52.500
You found something? What?
What do you want me to see?

33:55.500 --> 33:59.500
Oh, God.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.700
W-Were those all people?

34:22.500 --> 34:25.449
It's an odd world nowadays, isn't it?

34:25.500 --> 34:27.969
It's always been an odd world.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.449
Mm. I mean, doesn't it feel, sometimes,

34:31.500 --> 34:34.449
that things are coming to an end?

34:34.500 --> 34:37.449
Everything's just going nuts.

34:37.500 --> 34:41.449
You're middle-aged, that's
what it is. No offence.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.500
Everybody middle-aged always thinks
the world's about to come to an end.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.040
Never does.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.969
It's here.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.040
Oh, my God.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.450
'Hi, this is Clara Oswald.

35:11.500 --> 35:15.450
'I'm probably on the tube or in
outer space. Leave a message!'

35:15.500 --> 35:17.450
Can you change your
voicemail message, please,

35:17.500 --> 35:19.700
it's getting very boring.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.450
Oh, I see you've accessorised it.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.450
Yes.

35:25.500 --> 35:29.450
- The old question marks.
- You used to wear question marks.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.450
Oh, I know, yes, I did.

35:31.500 --> 35:34.450
They were nice. Why don't
you wear them any more?

35:34.500 --> 35:36.450
Oh, I do.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.450
I've got question mark underpants.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.370
Makes one wonder what the question is.

35:49.500 --> 35:52.450
Which one are you?

35:52.500 --> 35:54.450
Human or Zygon?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.450
- I don't answer that question.
- Why not?

35:56.500 --> 36:01.450
Because there isn't a question
to answer. I don't accept it.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.450
My sister and I were the living
embodiment of the peace we made.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.450
I will give all the lives
I have to protect it.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.450
You want to know who I am, Doctor?

36:09.500 --> 36:11.450
I am the peace.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.500
I am Human AND Zygon.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.450
Like a hybrid.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.570
A hybrid, if you like.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.450
Well, I'm proud to know you, Osgood.

36:26.500 --> 36:30.500
And I promise that I won't tell
anyone... that you're a human.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.450
Zygons need to keep the
human original alive

36:34.500 --> 36:38.450
to refresh the body print.
If you were a Zygon,

36:38.500 --> 36:40.450
you'd've changed back within
days of your sister's death.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.450
Those were the old rules.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.450
Before Zygons could pluck
loved ones from your memory

36:45.500 --> 36:46.450
and wear their faces.

36:46.500 --> 36:49.450
Zygons only need to
keep the original alive

36:49.500 --> 36:52.450
if they need more information from them.

36:52.500 --> 36:56.500
If the interrogation is over...
then the original can die.

37:08.500 --> 37:10.500
Oh, my God.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.500
These are Zygon pods.

37:20.500 --> 37:23.500
- I think you might be right.
- About what?

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
The end of the world.

37:45.500 --> 37:48.450
Bit of first-things-first-ness.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.500
What's your name?

37:55.500 --> 37:57.450
My name's -- well...

37:57.500 --> 37:59.840
you can call me the Doctor.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.450
But then you knew that, didn't you?

38:03.500 --> 38:05.450
You want something.

38:05.500 --> 38:06.450
What is it?

38:06.500 --> 38:10.450
You are the President of the World?

38:10.500 --> 38:11.450
I suppose so.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.450
We want... the world.

38:35.500 --> 38:39.450
OK. It looks like whole buildings
full of people have been pinched.

38:39.500 --> 38:42.450
In fact, it looks like a
whole London full of people

38:42.500 --> 38:45.450
have been pinched. But we've got
here early, they're still growing.

38:45.500 --> 38:48.450
We've have to neutralise
these before they hatch.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.500
Take your positions.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.450
Do you know what?

38:54.500 --> 38:56.450
I'm enjoying this.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.450
- Clara.
- What?

38:58.500 --> 39:00.450
We don't know that's what these are.

39:00.500 --> 39:04.500
Oh, come on. These are eggs,
or pods, or whatever -- look.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.570
Oh, my God, that's me.

39:16.500 --> 39:19.450
I think we should wait.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.450
Look, they're here,

39:21.500 --> 39:23.450
they're growing duplicates of us.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.450
We have to destroy them.

39:25.500 --> 39:29.450
I've seen this happen before.
It happened to that little boy,

39:29.500 --> 39:31.450
they took his parents
and then they took him.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.450
But I don't see how these ARE duplicates,

39:33.500 --> 39:37.450
that's not how Zygons work,
they don't grow duplicates,

39:37.500 --> 39:40.500
THEY kidnap the original, so these...

39:46.500 --> 39:50.450
These... ARE the humans.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.500
Retreat.

39:54.500 --> 39:57.500
Retreat! This is a trap!
This is an ambush!

40:03.500 --> 40:04.770
No...

40:07.500 --> 40:09.450
Oh, no, Miss Oswald, please. Please!

40:09.500 --> 40:11.450
Kill the traitors.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
Is he OK?

40:27.500 --> 40:30.450
Hello, Clara.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.500
My name is Bonnie.

40:57.500 --> 41:01.450
We want the truth of who we are

41:01.500 --> 41:03.450
to be acknowledged.

41:03.500 --> 41:07.450
We want to live as ourselves.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.450
At any cost. We want a home.

41:09.500 --> 41:12.450
Well, you can't have the United Kingdom.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.450
There's already people living there.

41:14.500 --> 41:17.450
They'll think you're going
to pinch their benefits.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.450
We're already there, Doctor.

41:19.500 --> 41:22.450
The invasion's already taken place,

41:22.500 --> 41:25.450
bit by bit, over the last year.

41:25.500 --> 41:29.450
We've won the first battle.

41:29.500 --> 41:33.500
And now, we are going to begin the war.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.450
There's hundreds more.

41:48.500 --> 41:51.450
They killed everybody.

41:51.500 --> 41:55.500
We have to find out what forms they
took, how many of them there were.

41:56.500 --> 42:00.450
- How did this happen?
- Somebody once caught the briefest of glimpses

42:00.500 --> 42:02.970
of a Zygon in its proper form.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.450
A child...

42:06.500 --> 42:09.500
who hadn't learned to
preserve its body print...

42:11.500 --> 42:13.450
.. who had been left alone

42:13.500 --> 42:16.100
to learn these things for itself.

42:18.500 --> 42:22.450
And then word went round
these primitives...

42:22.500 --> 42:25.450
- that we were monsters.
- "We"?

42:25.500 --> 42:28.100
There isn't any backup, is there?

42:30.500 --> 42:33.450
I just had to be sure.

42:49.500 --> 42:52.500
'Commander calling Truth or
Consequences. What is your status?'

42:56.500 --> 42:59.450
'Repeat, Commander calling
Truth or Consequences.

42:59.500 --> 43:02.450
- 'What is your status?'
- Commander...

43:02.500 --> 43:05.170
UNIT neutralised in North America,

43:06.500 --> 43:08.450
Truth or consequences.

43:08.500 --> 43:10.500
'Copy that.'

43:32.500 --> 43:35.500
Bonnie speaking. UNIT
neutralised in the UK.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.500
More or less.

44:00.500 --> 44:04.450
Answer it. Say goodbye.

44:04.500 --> 44:07.450
This plane will never land.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.450
Really. Clara?

44:09.500 --> 44:11.500
Doctor.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.770
- Clara?
- There you are.

44:16.500 --> 44:20.450
- Clara, I'm glad you're OK. Listen...
- You're breaking up.

44:20.500 --> 44:24.450
The invasion has happened. You're
probably surrounded by Zygons.

44:24.500 --> 44:27.450
Get to the Tardis, get yourself safe.

44:27.500 --> 44:28.450
And, apparently, my plane
is never going to land

44:28.500 --> 44:32.450
- but let's see what we're going
to do about that. - I'm sorry,

44:32.500 --> 44:34.450
but Clara's dead.

44:34.500 --> 44:36.450
Kate Stewart is dead,

44:36.500 --> 44:40.450
the UNIT troops are all dead.

44:40.500 --> 44:43.450
Truth or consequences.

44:44.305 --> 44:50.550
