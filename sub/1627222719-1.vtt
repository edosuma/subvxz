00:54.939 --> 00:56.774
<i>Are you ready?</i>

00:56.808 --> 00:58.508
Are you ready?

01:01.611 --> 01:03.313
And fight.

01:50.594 --> 01:52.697
Tap! Tap!

01:52.730 --> 01:53.865
That's it. That's it.

02:09.781 --> 02:12.349
Let me see it. Give it to me.

02:15.119 --> 02:16.419
Give it!

02:16.988 --> 02:18.956
Leave him alone!

02:18.990 --> 02:20.925
Hey, guys, look.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.927
- I got the freak's arm!
- Give it back!

02:34.772 --> 02:36.640
What's your name?

02:36.674 --> 02:38.608
Nick.

02:38.642 --> 02:41.078
My name's Abi.
You watch wrestling?

02:41.112 --> 02:42.947
Every Saturday morning.

02:42.980 --> 02:46.516
Me too. I watch it
every Saturday Morning, too.

02:46.550 --> 02:49.086
- Even the reruns?
- Yeah. Who's your favorite?

02:49.120 --> 02:50.620
Probably "The Bear Braun".

02:52.389 --> 02:53.456
Cool.

02:53.490 --> 02:55.325
It's yours. You keep it.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.062
Cool. Thanks.

04:00.658 --> 04:02.894
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:02.927 --> 04:04.494
Is Nick here?

04:04.527 --> 04:06.496
- What's your name?
- Abi.

04:06.529 --> 04:09.867
Abi. Okay, um...
Nick, Abi's here!

04:09.901 --> 04:11.421
- I'll show you to his room.
- Alright.

04:19.777 --> 04:22.046
We must be twins.

04:22.079 --> 04:24.916
I have those same posters.

04:24.949 --> 04:27.450
I'm the main event.
I never lose a bout!

04:27.484 --> 04:31.722
Here comes a sucka-sucka-sucker punch.
Lights out.

04:31.756 --> 04:35.558
I fear no man,
no beast, or evil brother.

04:35.592 --> 04:38.729
Awesome! My turn.

04:47.038 --> 04:50.573
When I grow up, I want to be
a professional wrestler.

04:50.607 --> 04:53.678
Have a big house.
Own four Harley's.

04:53.711 --> 04:56.080
Harley's? What's that?

04:56.113 --> 04:58.481
Only the greatest motorcycle
ever made.

04:58.515 --> 05:01.852
My dad promised
he'd buy me one when I turn 16.

05:01.886 --> 05:04.155
- What about your dad?
- What about him?

05:04.188 --> 05:06.724
- Where is he?
- Don't know.

05:06.757 --> 05:08.491
What do you mean you
"don't know"?

05:08.525 --> 05:10.828
He left when I was a baby.

05:10.861 --> 05:13.197
Well, he sucks.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.733
Yeah. He does.

05:21.872 --> 05:25.642
Sucka Punch Pinsky's
on the top apron and...

05:25.676 --> 05:27.510
<i>pile drives an elbow
into his head.</i>

05:27.544 --> 05:30.647
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Knock it off!

05:38.789 --> 05:43.928
Why don't you guys stop faking like
you wrestle, and do it for real, huh?

06:19.130 --> 06:21.065
A girl.

06:21.098 --> 06:23.234
You've got to be kidding me.

06:23.267 --> 06:24.969
Hey, Shelby, eat shit.

06:27.938 --> 06:30.007
Hey, what are you laughing at,
"Elbow"?

06:30.875 --> 06:31.976
His name is Nick.

06:32.009 --> 06:33.978
No, it ain't, it's Elbow.

06:34.011 --> 06:36.847
Alright, cut the crap.

06:36.881 --> 06:38.615
Everybody gather around.

06:39.884 --> 06:41.685
Come on,
move it like you mean it.

06:41.719 --> 06:43.120
There you go. Come on, come on.

06:43.154 --> 06:46.657
You, you, you, you,
let's do this.

06:46.690 --> 06:49.727
Come on, Elbow,
you better not lose to a girl.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.296
You know what,
don't you worry about me, man.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.689
Coach must know I'm the only
one that can handle the ladies.

06:58.369 --> 07:00.738
Holy crap! Oh, my God!

07:00.771 --> 07:03.274
Elbow just lost to a girl!

07:03.307 --> 07:05.876
Alright. Okay, alright.

07:05.910 --> 07:09.313
Let's, uh... Maybe we need to
go over some basics.

07:10.915 --> 07:12.016
<i>You're not gonna quit.</i>

07:13.651 --> 07:15.886
- Everybody laughed at me.
- So what?

07:15.920 --> 07:17.288
- "So what?"
- So what?

07:17.321 --> 07:18.999
The kids already make fun of me
because of my arm,

07:19.023 --> 07:20.367
now I get beat
by a girl, I mean...

07:20.391 --> 07:22.625
Do you like wrestling?

07:22.660 --> 07:25.029
- Yeah.
- Well, then you're gonna stick with it.

07:27.198 --> 07:31.936
Listen, if you don't believe in
yourself why would anybody else?

07:52.890 --> 07:55.726
Holy shit, man!
Are you kidding me?

07:55.759 --> 08:00.898
Man, this is a 1979
Harley Davidson Shovelhead.

08:00.931 --> 08:03.033
This beauty has
a high performance engine

08:03.067 --> 08:07.138
running 1,340 cc's
of pure aggression.

08:07.171 --> 08:10.174
S&S heads and carburetor,
all chrome parts,

08:10.207 --> 08:14.345
polished up with a two-tone metal flake
blue and green and a white pearl finish.

08:17.948 --> 08:20.017
I have no idea
what you just said.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.087
Chicks dig bikes.

08:25.756 --> 08:26.957
Keep telling yourself that.

08:28.826 --> 08:31.128
Wait, is that jealousy I smell?

08:31.162 --> 08:34.098
Oh-oh, yes, it is, Nick,
and it's strong.

08:34.131 --> 08:37.301
It's strong man.

08:37.334 --> 08:38.974
- Come on, we're going to be late.
- Yeah.

08:43.073 --> 08:46.210
Alright, there you go.
Take him down.

08:47.111 --> 08:48.179
Take him down.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.283
Keep active, keep active.
Active.

08:52.316 --> 08:53.884
Alright.

09:03.894 --> 09:06.230
Okay, okay, okay.
Good, Abi, good.

09:09.099 --> 09:10.099
Good, stand up.

09:16.173 --> 09:19.376
Nick. Nick.

09:19.410 --> 09:21.845
You can't let him
get position like that.

09:21.879 --> 09:24.014
Okay, so here, let's do it.

09:24.048 --> 09:28.152
Alright, if he gets the leg,
then loop your arm like this.

09:28.185 --> 09:30.154
Punch the wizard, there.

09:30.187 --> 09:32.427
Now you've got leverage,
you can throw him over your leg.

09:34.058 --> 09:35.092
Got it?

09:35.125 --> 09:37.261
Questions, comments, concerns?

09:37.294 --> 09:39.930
- Yeah, I got it.
- Okay. Alright, then try.

09:39.964 --> 09:40.998
Your turn, come on.

09:46.303 --> 09:49.406
There you go.
Yeah, there you go, alright.

09:51.075 --> 09:53.410
Loop your arm, loop your arm,
loop your arm!

09:53.444 --> 09:55.279
Faster, faster!

10:00.918 --> 10:02.019
Alright, good, Abi.

10:06.890 --> 10:10.394
Nick, do you know
what happened there?

10:10.427 --> 10:14.798
- Yeah, he kicked my ass.
- Good observation. Do you know why?

10:14.832 --> 10:16.333
That's the key
to getting better.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.412
See how that works?

10:28.445 --> 10:30.414
Left arm behind the head.

10:30.447 --> 10:32.449
You only need your right-hand
to pull this off.

10:33.917 --> 10:35.152
Alright, it's your turn.

10:46.530 --> 10:47.530
Not bad.

11:36.580 --> 11:38.349
Alright, guys,
come on, huddle up.

11:38.382 --> 11:39.550
Come on, move it.

11:41.452 --> 11:44.121
Remember, every point counts,
stay off your backs.

11:44.154 --> 11:45.122
Abi, you're up.

11:45.155 --> 11:46.490
Alright, send him out.

11:47.558 --> 11:49.226
Yeah.

11:49.259 --> 11:51.428
- One, two, three...
- Abi!

12:03.273 --> 12:04.541
Come on, work. Work, Abi, work!

12:15.452 --> 12:17.421
Run the bar, run the bar.

12:21.091 --> 12:23.193
Come on, get him, Abi. Get him!

12:23.227 --> 12:25.028
Yes!

12:26.597 --> 12:28.232
Good, Abi, good.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.035
- Good job, son.
- Thank you, sir.

12:36.440 --> 12:40.611
Hey, hey, hey, yes! Good job.

12:40.644 --> 12:43.380
Next up at 150lbs:

12:43.414 --> 12:46.917
Nick Newell versus Tyler Burrow.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.997
- Alright, let's send him out.
- Let's go.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.122
- Alright.
- Let's go, Nick.

12:52.156 --> 12:54.491
- One, two, three...
- Nick.

12:57.995 --> 13:00.364
- You've got this, bro.
- Remember the basics.

13:00.397 --> 13:03.100
Remember what we talked about,
stay focused.

13:09.473 --> 13:10.574
You got this.

13:12.376 --> 13:13.977
- You can do it.
- Come on.

13:14.011 --> 13:15.279
It's all yours.

13:46.109 --> 13:47.344
Tough finish.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.282
Geez, Coach,
kid only had one arm.

13:56.553 --> 13:57.655
Good effort.

13:58.288 --> 13:59.691
Hey...

13:59.724 --> 14:01.124
you'll get him
next time, alright.

14:15.305 --> 14:17.174
Nick, dinner's ready.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.012
Come on.

14:25.315 --> 14:26.550
What's wrong?

14:27.719 --> 14:30.053
I can't do this, Mom.

14:30.087 --> 14:33.290
Look, the only
disability in life

14:33.323 --> 14:35.158
is a shitty attitude, Nick.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.730
You can do it.

15:00.852 --> 15:04.454
Jim, over here!
Jim, I want you to meet my son.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.490
Jim, hi, how are you?

15:07.725 --> 15:10.093
- Jim Abbott.
- So they tell me.

15:10.127 --> 15:11.763
Mr. Abbott,
my son is a big fan of yours.

15:11.796 --> 15:13.573
I mean, if we could
just have a moment of your time.

15:13.597 --> 15:15.375
He's a wrestler,
he's not very good but he's...

15:15.399 --> 15:16.400
- Mom.
- What?

15:16.433 --> 15:18.569
Wrestling, huh?

15:18.602 --> 15:21.505
I'll tell you what,
I don't have to be back for a few minutes

15:21.538 --> 15:24.842
so why don't we
go over here and have a chat.

15:24.876 --> 15:26.510
Come on, let's go.

15:32.482 --> 15:34.318
So you're a wrestler, huh?

15:36.353 --> 15:37.722
Yeah, but, um...

15:37.755 --> 15:39.389
But what?

15:43.560 --> 15:45.395
I suck.

15:46.496 --> 15:48.599
Do you want to know something?

15:48.632 --> 15:50.868
I sucked too,
when I was in high school.

15:52.636 --> 15:56.473
But I loved baseball,
more than anything.

15:57.675 --> 15:59.109
And I stuck with it.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.247
If you love wrestling,

16:04.281 --> 16:07.384
you've got to work harder
than everyone else.

16:09.954 --> 16:11.521
But do what you love.

16:22.967 --> 16:24.267
Stick with it.

16:26.738 --> 16:29.172
And never give up.

16:47.491 --> 16:50.327
- Oh, hey, Coach.
- Oh, Nick will be right out.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.629
Coach, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

16:52.664 --> 16:54.264
Sure, what's up?

16:54.297 --> 16:56.433
I was wondering if you
thought there might be a way

16:56.466 --> 16:58.836
for Nick to get better, quicker.

17:00.504 --> 17:02.572
Well, there's-there's
wrestling camp

17:02.606 --> 17:04.307
over the summer but it's...

17:04.341 --> 17:06.276
- But?
- But it's not cheap,

17:06.309 --> 17:08.509
and I'm never comfortable
spending other people's money.

17:09.881 --> 17:11.749
Alright,
let me worry about that.

17:37.675 --> 17:39.443
Sorry, I'm late.
I'll get dinner ready.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.012
No, don't worry about it.

17:41.045 --> 17:42.780
No, it'll only take me
a few minutes.

17:42.814 --> 17:45.917
- Mom, sit down.
- Hm...

17:47.819 --> 17:48.853
What's wrong?

17:53.825 --> 17:55.258
What's-what's the matter?

17:56.526 --> 17:58.361
Why were these in the trash?

18:00.832 --> 18:02.466
Because Coach Jeremy
thinks you should go

18:02.499 --> 18:04.577
to wrestling camp this summer,
and I happen to be in agreement.

18:04.601 --> 18:05.837
I know.

18:05.870 --> 18:07.313
Well, then why didn't you
say anything?

18:07.337 --> 18:08.438
Because we can't afford it.

18:08.472 --> 18:10.708
That is not for you
to worry about.

18:10.742 --> 18:12.442
- I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

18:12.476 --> 18:13.945
It's already been decided, Nick.

18:16.681 --> 18:19.884
You need that money,
for nursing school, it's important.

18:19.917 --> 18:21.786
It is not as important.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.434
And when you become a parent
one day you will realize

18:28.458 --> 18:30.962
that your kids dreams
come before your own, okay?

18:31.929 --> 18:33.463
Please allow me that.

18:39.536 --> 18:44.307
Just promise me... promise me one day
you're gonna go to nursing school.

18:44.341 --> 18:45.843
Okay, I promise you.

19:28.052 --> 19:30.620
Alright, time to get back
in the game, right?

19:30.655 --> 19:32.622
You've got to get
your head right, out of summer.

19:32.657 --> 19:34.091
Gonna be a great season.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.127
Hey, come on.
Come on, you guys, sit down.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.428
Join us. Nick, Abi, sit down.

19:38.461 --> 19:39.964
Abi, Nick, welcome back.

19:39.997 --> 19:41.631
Great.

19:41.666 --> 19:43.034
We're gonna suck
again this year.

19:43.067 --> 19:46.771
Hey. Hey, that's enough, Shelby.
It's a team effort.

19:46.804 --> 19:49.006
Then Elbow
doesn't belong on the team.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.842
Well, you're one to talk Shelby.

19:50.875 --> 19:53.510
Only move your good at
is shitting out of your mouth.

19:53.543 --> 19:54.846
Cool it, Newell.

19:54.879 --> 19:57.347
- Hey...
- You know, how about we wrestle?

19:58.883 --> 20:00.117
Yeah.

20:00.151 --> 20:02.053
How about we wrestle.

20:02.086 --> 20:04.922
Elbow, what dreamland
are you living in?

20:06.090 --> 20:07.524
I want to wrestle him, Coach.

20:09.492 --> 20:11.394
Tell you what,
if you win I'll walk.

20:14.999 --> 20:15.999
Alright, Nick.

20:17.601 --> 20:20.637
So if he wins,
no more nicknames, right?

20:23.074 --> 20:24.541
- Do it, Shelby.
- Alright.

20:24.574 --> 20:25.743
You scared?

20:28.813 --> 20:31.716
Alright, freak, let's do this.

20:38.656 --> 20:39.656
Wrestle.

20:41.458 --> 20:42.894
Come on, Nick, kick his ass.

20:45.663 --> 20:46.664
Where are you going?

20:50.835 --> 20:52.169
You done yet?

20:52.203 --> 20:53.771
Not even close.

21:00.144 --> 21:01.144
Yes!

21:07.151 --> 21:09.086
No, no, no.

21:10.888 --> 21:13.556
Okay, alright, he's pinned,
he's pinned. It's over.

21:14.557 --> 21:15.760
Yes!

21:15.793 --> 21:16.793
Hey!

21:18.029 --> 21:20.231
That's not fair!

21:20.264 --> 21:22.599
I was clearly
outside of the circle.

21:22.632 --> 21:26.603
- What, you want to go again?
- No, no, it's over it's over. Newell won.

21:26.636 --> 21:28.005
No more nicknames, period.

21:29.907 --> 21:31.042
Nice.

21:41.852 --> 21:44.088
Whoo!

21:50.061 --> 21:51.162
You're a beast, man

21:51.195 --> 21:53.130
I agree.

21:53.164 --> 21:56.233
Nick Newell
and Jeff Sommers to the mat.

21:56.267 --> 21:58.601
Alright, alright, listen to me,

21:58.635 --> 22:01.038
this guy is strong,
and he has good technique.

22:01.072 --> 22:02.605
Alright. Any weaknesses?

22:02.639 --> 22:06.010
Uh, nope, he's basically like
the perfect wrestler.

22:07.678 --> 22:11.548
- Sick.
- No, Nick, you can beat him.

22:11.581 --> 22:13.184
Just don't let him
dictate the action.

22:13.217 --> 22:15.686
Stay aggressive,
and go right after him.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.254
Hey, hey, hey,
who's the coach here?

22:17.288 --> 22:19.223
- Sorry, Coach.
- Alright, Nick, listen.

22:19.256 --> 22:23.661
Listen, I want you to do...
to do exactly what Abi says.

22:23.694 --> 22:26.964
Huh? We only need one more match
win to get us to regionals.

22:26.998 --> 22:30.968
Alright, okay,
huddle up, come on.

22:31.002 --> 22:33.771
Alright, it's Nick. Here we go.

22:35.572 --> 22:37.875
- Alright, one, two, three...
- Nick!

23:02.733 --> 23:04.668
Nick, Nick, you done?

23:06.636 --> 23:09.240
There's a consolation match
coming up in...

23:09.273 --> 23:11.909
Oh, man, I am freezing
my ass off out here.

23:15.913 --> 23:20.317
Alright, I'm going back inside.

23:20.351 --> 23:23.187
If you're not right behind me
I'm gonna tell the officials

23:23.220 --> 23:26.323
that you're forfeiting the
consolation round because you quit.

23:27.825 --> 23:29.193
Are you a quitter, Newell?

23:38.903 --> 23:41.872
Just remember, remember Nick,

23:41.906 --> 23:45.608
fear is only temporary,
regret is forever.

24:28.352 --> 24:30.688
Got 'em.

24:30.721 --> 24:32.756
Dammit.

24:32.790 --> 24:34.425
Oh, you're getting
much better, man.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.660
Yeah.

24:39.096 --> 24:41.765
- Almost. Yeah.
- Almost? How about a rematch?

24:41.799 --> 24:42.933
- Let's go.
- Rematch?

24:42.967 --> 24:44.168
Can we get some more beers

24:44.201 --> 24:46.303
whenever you get a chance,
please? Thank you.

24:51.041 --> 24:54.145
I missed you, man.
It's been a while.

24:54.178 --> 24:55.178
Yeah.

24:56.313 --> 24:58.949
Yeah, man, too long.

25:01.452 --> 25:03.220
Let's not let that happen again.

25:04.388 --> 25:06.690
Deal.

25:06.724 --> 25:08.101
I'm going to empty
the tanks real quick, alright.

25:08.125 --> 25:09.160
Yeah.

25:13.364 --> 25:15.199
- I'm sorry, man.
- What the hell, man?

25:22.940 --> 25:24.074
Are we done here?

25:25.242 --> 25:26.710
Yeah, we're done.

25:31.882 --> 25:34.251
That was crazy. Where the hell
did you learn how to do that?

25:34.285 --> 25:35.486
Yeah, man, I know, I...

25:35.519 --> 25:37.454
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

25:38.389 --> 25:39.690
Check this out.

26:00.778 --> 26:02.146
So this is mixed martial arts?

26:02.179 --> 26:04.014
Yeah, man, it's a combat sport

26:04.048 --> 26:05.883
that combines both
striking and wrestling.

26:05.916 --> 26:08.886
It's growing like crazy
right now.

26:08.919 --> 26:10.788
And you want to know
what the best part is?

26:11.322 --> 26:12.356
What?

26:12.389 --> 26:14.091
We get paid.

26:18.028 --> 26:19.330
That's-that's cool and all, Abi.

26:19.363 --> 26:21.265
We're not MMA fighters.

26:21.298 --> 26:23.867
Yeah, but we're wrestlers,

26:23.901 --> 26:26.237
which is the best foundation
to start with.

26:28.405 --> 26:29.405
Come on.

26:38.949 --> 26:41.051
Hey, you here for the try outs?

26:41.085 --> 26:42.453
Oh, yeah.

26:42.486 --> 26:45.456
- Tryouts?
- Yes, next week.

26:45.489 --> 26:47.400
Several of you will beat
the shit out of each other,

26:47.424 --> 26:48.568
and one of you will be
the winner,

26:48.592 --> 26:51.128
and get $500 and a fight

26:51.161 --> 26:53.530
in next month's
amateur promotion.

26:55.065 --> 26:56.467
Do you want to fill one out?

26:56.500 --> 26:58.469
Five-hundred bucks right?

26:58.502 --> 27:00.371
If you're the winner, yeah.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.341
Yeah, give me an application.

27:04.375 --> 27:06.076
- Alright then.
- Thank you.

27:09.947 --> 27:11.915
Good thing you
write with your right hand.

27:55.225 --> 27:56.960
This is what you
want to do to make money?

27:57.961 --> 28:00.931
Hell, yeah. It pays well.

28:05.436 --> 28:08.505
Besides,
these guys are strikers.

28:08.539 --> 28:11.241
You get them to the ground
and they're helpless.

28:12.509 --> 28:13.509
Mm.

28:19.216 --> 28:22.096
How many punches am I gonna have to
take before I get them to the ground?

28:23.053 --> 28:25.856
A few,
but you've got a thick skull.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.360
You're up.

28:34.331 --> 28:35.966
Show 'em how it's done, man.

28:44.608 --> 28:46.176
Let's go, Abi!

29:01.959 --> 29:03.160
Oh, sh...

29:14.071 --> 29:15.205
Come on, man, come on.

29:18.242 --> 29:19.610
Come on, Abi, lock it in!

29:21.645 --> 29:25.215
Yes! Come on, baby! Hell, yeah!

29:27.351 --> 29:29.553
Okay, next up.

29:35.092 --> 29:36.493
My boy.

29:36.527 --> 29:38.162
That's not bad, man.

29:38.195 --> 29:40.631
Alright. Kick his ass, alright.

29:40.665 --> 29:44.101
- Alright, man.
- Yeah. Go get him.

29:47.004 --> 29:48.605
Alright, guys,
let's keep it clean.

29:48.639 --> 29:51.508
I just want to
see your skills, okay?

29:51.542 --> 29:54.077
Yo, I can't fight this guy.

29:54.111 --> 29:55.747
You know, if I had a dollar

29:55.780 --> 29:57.181
for every asswipe
that's said that,

29:57.214 --> 29:58.525
I wouldn't have to fight
for this 500.

29:58.549 --> 30:00.317
Bro, who are you
calling an asswipe, man?

30:00.350 --> 30:02.386
Okay, you know what,
to compete in this promotion,

30:02.419 --> 30:06.356
you actually need to physically
beat him not with your scary words.

30:06.390 --> 30:09.526
So let's fight, huh?
You guys ready?

30:09.560 --> 30:12.262
It's your funeral, gimp.

30:14.298 --> 30:17.167
Okay. Fight.

30:25.175 --> 30:26.678
Gotta protect yourself, Nick.

30:42.626 --> 30:44.729
Wrestle, Nick, wrestle!
Get him to the ground!

30:47.264 --> 30:48.298
There you go.

31:02.747 --> 31:07.518
Okay, uh, he's technically
asleep now, so nice going.

31:09.453 --> 31:10.587
Yes!

31:10.621 --> 31:12.422
Whoo!

31:12.456 --> 31:14.157
Alright, uh, first of all,

31:14.191 --> 31:16.059
I want to thank all of you
for coming out

31:16.093 --> 31:18.562
and kicking ass the way you did.
Very impressive.

31:18.595 --> 31:20.597
I wish we had more than
one spot quite frankly,

31:20.631 --> 31:24.167
because a few of you really
could be moving on at this point.

31:24.201 --> 31:27.070
But only one of you can,
as promised.

31:27.104 --> 31:30.574
So without further ado,

31:30.607 --> 31:34.378
the winner is Abi Maestre.

31:35.512 --> 31:38.615
Look at this guy.
How about that?

31:38.649 --> 31:40.217
Hey, drinks on me
tonight, fellas.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.318
Alright, but listen up,

31:41.351 --> 31:43.554
you got four weeks
to prepare, okay.

31:43.587 --> 31:46.791
This Matt Bartunek,
he's not to be taken lightly.

31:46.824 --> 31:50.193
He'll rip off your head and show it
to you before you die, you understand?

31:50.227 --> 31:52.195
- Yes, sir.
- Alright, let's hear it for him.

32:06.143 --> 32:08.111
- Alright, alright, alright.
- Whoo!

32:08.145 --> 32:10.314
All you other losers
better beware,

32:10.347 --> 32:13.650
he'll smash you,
and thrash you, Bubba the Bear!

32:17.154 --> 32:18.656
The Bear's in trouble.

32:18.690 --> 32:21.191
Ladies and gentlemen,
we might have a new champion.

32:21.224 --> 32:22.727
Ahh, not so fast.

32:26.597 --> 32:27.832
Come on, man.

32:30.702 --> 32:32.737
I gotta get going, man.

32:32.770 --> 32:34.504
I'm having dinner with my dad.

32:34.538 --> 32:37.374
Your dad, seriously?

32:38.275 --> 32:39.343
Yeah.

32:40.812 --> 32:42.346
I'll fill you in later.

32:44.481 --> 32:45.482
Alright.

32:58.595 --> 33:02.332
Man I, uh...
I wish you were fighting too.

33:03.868 --> 33:08.305
Nah, they picked the best guy.

33:08.338 --> 33:10.708
Besides, man, for the first time
in my life, I...

33:12.844 --> 33:14.812
I feel like I have
some sort of direction.

33:16.313 --> 33:17.682
So thank you for that.

33:18.615 --> 33:20.183
You always have my back.

33:22.586 --> 33:26.289
Of course, man,
you're my brother.

33:26.891 --> 33:28.726
You're my brother.

33:31.796 --> 33:33.230
Now, I'll see you tomorrow,
right?

33:33.263 --> 33:34.297
Yes, sir.

33:37.001 --> 33:40.404
Hey, yo, Nick,
do me a favor, alright?

33:40.437 --> 33:41.538
What's up?

33:42.506 --> 33:43.741
Keep your hands up.

33:45.475 --> 33:46.576
Keep my hands up?

33:46.610 --> 33:48.478
Yeah, yeah?

34:14.371 --> 34:15.371
Need a hand with that?

34:19.476 --> 34:20.912
Is that a joke?

34:20.945 --> 34:23.647
Oh, hell no, I-I didn't
mean that I just was...

34:23.681 --> 34:24.782
I'm kidding, Erroll.

34:28.953 --> 34:31.923
Um... it's okay to call me dad.

34:31.956 --> 34:33.590
Yeah, I know.

34:35.827 --> 34:38.428
Is that why you changed
your last name to Newell?

34:38.462 --> 34:39.563
Are you ashamed of my name?

34:39.596 --> 34:40.732
No.

34:43.034 --> 34:44.601
But Mom was.

34:47.537 --> 34:51.641
Listen, Nick, I don't know what your
mom told you about why I left...

34:53.077 --> 34:55.545
but there is so much more...

34:55.579 --> 34:57.481
She told me that you were
a selfish shit

34:57.514 --> 35:00.017
who freaked out at the idea
of raising a kid with one arm.

35:01.451 --> 35:03.688
That sounds like typical
Stacey bullshit.

35:03.721 --> 35:07.557
Hey, Nick, Nick, Nick.
Come on, come...

35:07.591 --> 35:09.559
I'm sorry, come on, come back.

35:13.064 --> 35:14.564
Come on.

35:14.598 --> 35:16.533
No, you listen to me.

35:16.566 --> 35:18.045
You don't get to
talk to her like that.

35:18.069 --> 35:20.537
You don't get to
speak about her like that.

35:20.570 --> 35:23.440
You weren't there for me
and she was.

35:23.473 --> 35:25.710
You weren't there for me
when I needed you.

35:27.678 --> 35:29.781
She's more of a parent to me
that you would ever be.

35:32.349 --> 35:33.349
I know.

35:34.919 --> 35:36.921
I know.

35:36.954 --> 35:40.725
I let you down, and I'm sorry.

35:42.126 --> 35:44.695
I couldn't get my shit together.

35:44.729 --> 35:50.400
I had some issues, some demons
that I couldn't quite drown.

35:51.702 --> 35:55.372
But, look, I-I'm...
I'm better now.

35:55.405 --> 35:56.674
You know what, just..

35:59.643 --> 36:00.812
Don't worry about it.

36:03.114 --> 36:04.581
Mom and I did just fine.

36:05.850 --> 36:06.850
I know you did.

36:10.154 --> 36:11.989
I noticed
you're wrestling again.

36:13.057 --> 36:14.491
How'd you know that?

36:17.061 --> 36:19.596
Hey, how'd you know I even
wrestled in the first place?

36:20.530 --> 36:23.533
Well, I... I check in.

36:24.467 --> 36:25.467
Always have.

36:32.542 --> 36:33.610
Second chance.

36:34.411 --> 36:35.478
Second chance.

36:37.815 --> 36:38.916
Hey, Mom.

36:42.653 --> 36:43.654
Mom?

36:45.589 --> 36:46.657
Mom, what's wrong?

36:48.159 --> 36:49.861
Mom...

36:50.962 --> 36:53.597
Abi was in
a motorcycle accident.

36:55.967 --> 36:57.534
Well, is he okay?

36:59.136 --> 37:01.605
Nick, he died.

37:03.074 --> 37:04.374
What?

37:05.609 --> 37:07.410
What?

37:07.444 --> 37:09.780
- I'm so sorry.
- Abi's dead?

37:14.085 --> 37:15.920
- No.
- Nick...

37:16.988 --> 37:20.725
No. No, Mom, no, no.

38:17.048 --> 38:20.751
Why?! Why?! Why him?!

38:20.785 --> 38:24.889
Why?! Why him?! Why?!

39:01.624 --> 39:02.624
Hey, Nick.

39:04.729 --> 39:06.529
Yeah.

39:06.563 --> 39:07.665
Listen, uh...

39:09.200 --> 39:11.202
I just wanted to say
how sorry I am about Abi.

39:11.235 --> 39:12.870
I know how close you two were.

39:14.238 --> 39:15.272
Yeah.

39:16.841 --> 39:18.608
Yeah, you guys, uh,

39:18.641 --> 39:20.911
you both showed real skill
during the try outs, you know.

39:22.113 --> 39:24.081
I watch you train every day.

39:25.582 --> 39:27.018
Thank you.

39:27.051 --> 39:30.154
Yeah, we still got
that promotional fight...

39:31.722 --> 39:34.125
against Bartunek,
you know, coming up.

39:37.862 --> 39:39.562
How would you feel
about stepping in?

39:42.266 --> 39:44.735
For Abi?

39:44.769 --> 39:47.304
I watch you
train every day with him.

39:47.338 --> 39:48.906
You're ready.

39:51.608 --> 39:54.245
And I'll pay you
the same 500 I promised to him.

39:56.747 --> 39:58.249
The fight's in two days.

40:01.385 --> 40:04.321
Yeah, okay, $1,000 then.

40:04.355 --> 40:06.657
And we got
the championship arena.

40:11.996 --> 40:15.598
Hey, what the hell else
you gonna do on Saturday night?

40:26.277 --> 40:30.181
Hey, you got a nickname?

40:31.749 --> 40:34.051
Um, no.

40:35.252 --> 40:36.954
How about Notorious Nick?

40:39.190 --> 40:40.623
Eh, try it on.

40:48.432 --> 40:49.733
Welcome home.

40:51.035 --> 40:53.737
Wow, Chinese food.

40:53.771 --> 40:55.906
I mean, this is something else.

40:55.940 --> 40:58.242
I got you
your favorite too, here.

41:02.146 --> 41:03.714
You're up to something.

41:05.783 --> 41:06.884
What is this?

41:12.356 --> 41:14.796
There's no way you're not going
to finish nursing school, Mom.

41:16.694 --> 41:18.162
Where did you get
this type of money?

41:19.363 --> 41:21.932
- Where?
- I'm filling in for Abi.

41:23.467 --> 41:26.036
You're fighting?

41:26.070 --> 41:29.073
- Yeah.
- Are you out of your mind?

41:29.106 --> 41:31.151
I mean, who's gonna pay for your
medical bills, Nick, when you get hurt?

41:31.175 --> 41:33.144
We don't have medical insurance.

41:33.177 --> 41:35.179
You're almost a nurse,
right, so...

41:35.212 --> 41:36.814
Very funny.

41:36.847 --> 41:41.185
Mom, I'm gonna be careful.

41:41.218 --> 41:42.820
Okay, I know
how to protect myself.

41:42.853 --> 41:46.190
No, no, this is... this is...
this is crazy.

41:46.223 --> 41:48.692
Look, you've been taking care
of me my entire life.

41:50.194 --> 41:53.230
I want to help, it's my turn.

41:58.002 --> 42:01.205
Well, I guess if you're gonna
fight you better kick some ass.

42:03.774 --> 42:05.743
I mean,
some serious ass kicking.

42:05.776 --> 42:06.977
I will.

42:09.213 --> 42:10.915
Oh, my God.

42:12.783 --> 42:14.084
All for me?

42:23.260 --> 42:24.260
Nick.

42:26.897 --> 42:28.098
Coach.

42:30.034 --> 42:31.769
Long time, no see. What's up?

42:32.369 --> 42:33.737
Um...

42:35.773 --> 42:38.142
Look, I have...
I have a fight coming up.

42:39.977 --> 42:42.246
I was wondering if
you would work my corner.

42:46.317 --> 42:48.018
I don't work with quitters, kid.

42:52.056 --> 42:54.225
- Coach, this-this fight...
- I can't do it.

42:56.260 --> 42:57.962
My time's too valuable.

42:59.997 --> 43:01.232
Good luck.

43:13.277 --> 43:17.414
It's time for our next contest.

43:17.448 --> 43:22.186
Introducing first,
fighting out of the red corner,

43:22.219 --> 43:27.258
with a record of six wins
and zero losses,

43:27.291 --> 43:28.993
please welcome

43:29.026 --> 43:34.498
Matt "The Beast" Bartunek.

43:36.233 --> 43:41.472
And in the blue corner,
fighting for the first time,

43:41.505 --> 43:46.944
please welcome
Notorious Nick Newell.

43:48.245 --> 43:49.947
Notorious.

43:51.448 --> 43:52.549
To the center, gentlemen.

43:56.020 --> 43:59.456
Now, remember,
protect yourself at all times.

43:59.490 --> 44:02.326
If you don't have any questions,
just touch gloves. Good luck.

44:09.633 --> 44:10.901
Are you ready?

44:12.336 --> 44:13.504
Are you ready?

44:15.139 --> 44:16.807
And fight.

44:28.018 --> 44:29.018
Nick.

44:40.297 --> 44:41.865
Wrestle, dammit.

45:13.030 --> 45:15.399
Tap! Tap!

45:15.432 --> 45:18.302
That's it, that's it.

45:38.055 --> 45:39.556
How is he?

45:39.590 --> 45:41.325
He's a very lucky man.

45:41.358 --> 45:44.061
If you start getting headaches
or feeling nauseous,

45:44.094 --> 45:46.397
you need to see
a doctor immediately.

45:46.430 --> 45:49.099
- Understand?
- He understands.

46:00.077 --> 46:02.613
I didn't know.

46:02.646 --> 46:05.182
- Know what?
- I didn't know how brutal this sport is.

46:05.215 --> 46:08.285
I can't watch you
take another beatdown like that.

46:08.318 --> 46:10.154
What does that mean?

46:10.187 --> 46:12.089
It means that you
cannot fight again

46:12.122 --> 46:13.624
or you're gonna
get seriously hurt.

46:14.525 --> 46:16.093
I'll be fine, I promise.

46:16.126 --> 46:18.228
You cannot promise me
that about this.

46:18.262 --> 46:20.340
You can't promise me that you're
not gonna end up in a hospital,

46:20.364 --> 46:22.199
brain dead
with tubes keeping you alive.

46:22.232 --> 46:24.635
- You're being overly dramatic.
- Am I?

46:24.669 --> 46:27.237
You always told me that I could
be anything I put my mind to.

46:27.271 --> 46:28.515
That doesn't mean
that you're superhuman,

46:28.539 --> 46:31.041
and that you're not
gonna get seriously hurt!

46:31.074 --> 46:34.411
You need to quit
before that ends up happening.

46:37.214 --> 46:38.659
I can't believe
you're telling me to quit.

46:38.683 --> 46:40.317
Listen to me.

46:40.350 --> 46:42.619
Listen to me.

46:42.654 --> 46:45.766
I have always told you that I would be honest
with you no matter how much it hurts you,

46:45.790 --> 46:50.227
and you cannot make a career
of this sport Nick. You cannot.

46:50.260 --> 46:52.129
I don't need to hear that
from you right now.

46:54.364 --> 46:55.999
I've heard that shit
my entire life,

46:56.033 --> 46:57.669
I don't need to
hear it from you!

46:58.569 --> 47:00.137
Well, you just did.

47:26.630 --> 47:28.031
Coach.

47:31.736 --> 47:33.537
I thought I might find you here.

47:43.580 --> 47:45.349
I saw your fight
the other night.

47:47.484 --> 47:48.686
You shoulda won.

47:50.755 --> 47:52.589
Instead, you fought stupid
with anger

47:52.623 --> 47:56.193
and let your emotions
get the better of you.

48:04.501 --> 48:06.136
Anything else?

48:06.169 --> 48:08.071
You went toe-to-toe
with a puncher.

48:09.306 --> 48:11.843
Played right into his strength

48:11.876 --> 48:15.312
instead of exploiting his
weakness, which was wrestling.

48:19.616 --> 48:21.753
Did I do anything right?

48:21.786 --> 48:26.758
Yeah,
you showed unbelievable heart.

48:29.126 --> 48:33.230
That can't be learned.
You either have it or you don't.

48:33.263 --> 48:35.599
You have it in spades, kid.

48:40.404 --> 48:43.173
I should have never quit on you.

48:43.206 --> 48:44.508
You know, you didn't quit on me,

48:44.541 --> 48:47.110
you quit on yourself,
you quit on the team.

48:47.144 --> 48:49.246
I didn't think
I was good enough.

48:49.279 --> 48:51.214
What makes you think
you're good enough now?

48:52.784 --> 48:54.618
Because Abi thought so.

48:58.823 --> 49:00.357
It's okay to grieve, kid.

49:02.827 --> 49:06.764
Grieving leaves scars that
each wears as a badge of honor.

49:08.165 --> 49:10.868
It means you love someone.

49:10.902 --> 49:13.270
And take it from me,
the mourning will never stop.

49:13.303 --> 49:15.372
And you should never want it to.

49:15.405 --> 49:17.374
I wanted to win
the fight for him.

49:19.610 --> 49:22.179
You don't honor Abi
by winning a fight.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.248
Win the fights for yourself.

49:32.657 --> 49:36.761
You're gonna have to listen to what I
say, and trust me.

49:39.196 --> 49:40.832
You saying
you're going to train me?

49:50.675 --> 49:51.709
Coach...

49:54.846 --> 49:56.480
I need to do this.

49:58.950 --> 50:01.652
You know I don't know shit
about mixed martial arts.

50:07.692 --> 50:09.559
Does it look like I do?

50:12.496 --> 50:17.267
No, no. We're going to learn.

50:45.529 --> 50:47.497
Alright, all the way down.

50:47.531 --> 50:48.833
All the way down.

50:51.035 --> 50:52.302
Alright, that's good.

50:52.335 --> 50:54.371
Come on, come on, come on!
One more.

50:54.404 --> 50:58.642
Push, push. You can do it.

50:58.676 --> 51:00.610
Oh, your new
sparring partner's here.

51:20.530 --> 51:22.033
He's pretty square
on his opponent.

51:22.066 --> 51:24.267
See this guy? This guy, too,
is dominating, right?

51:24.301 --> 51:27.270
Look how this guy backs up...
then he sneaks by.

51:27.304 --> 51:29.506
But now he-he seems like he's...

51:29.539 --> 51:31.641
- Certainly being the aggressor.
- Right.

51:46.958 --> 51:48.059
Alright, Nick.

51:48.092 --> 51:49.026
Nick, we made it, man.

51:49.060 --> 51:51.963
We made it.
We are here, fight number one.

51:51.996 --> 51:54.832
Alright, prove you belong.
Prove you belong!

52:00.738 --> 52:01.973
Fighter, are you ready?

52:03.440 --> 52:04.440
Fighter, are you ready?

52:05.342 --> 52:06.343
Fight.

52:19.090 --> 52:20.524
Get out of there,
get out of there!

52:33.436 --> 52:34.806
You got it. You got him.
Hold him!

52:42.379 --> 52:44.882
Oh, oh! Whoa! Whoo!

52:50.620 --> 52:52.657
KO! KO, KO, KO!

53:05.602 --> 53:06.771
Jab! Give me a pop up.

53:06.804 --> 53:07.905
Give me a pop up. There.

53:31.494 --> 53:32.529
There, Nick...

53:46.844 --> 53:47.844
Alright, here we go.

53:51.514 --> 53:52.950
He doesn't look that tough.

54:22.179 --> 54:25.683
Yeah, yeah! Hell, yeah! Whoo!

54:26.784 --> 54:28.551
I guess looks can be deceiving.

54:34.926 --> 54:36.426
Rich, hey.

54:37.128 --> 54:38.128
It's Nick.

54:39.196 --> 54:41.666
Hey, Rich.

54:41.699 --> 54:43.968
I just wanted to, uh,
congratulate you on your win.

54:44.001 --> 54:45.435
Hey, thanks, man.

54:50.507 --> 54:52.109
It's gonna be
a real honor to fight you.

54:54.644 --> 54:57.447
Fight me? Fat chance.

54:58.749 --> 55:00.017
What do you mean?

55:00.051 --> 55:02.619
Nick's ranked number one,
he's your mandatory.

55:03.988 --> 55:05.756
I don't give a shit.

55:05.790 --> 55:08.225
I'm a legitimate fighter,
not a publicity stunt.

55:08.259 --> 55:10.161
Who the hell are you
calling a publicity stunt?

55:10.194 --> 55:12.997
I can't even
take you serious, little boy.

55:13.030 --> 55:15.632
Look, how do we benefit
in either case?

55:15.666 --> 55:17.068
- It's a lose-lose.
- Right.

55:17.101 --> 55:20.637
If we beat you, then Rich
beat a one-handed fighter.

55:20.671 --> 55:22.139
And if he loses...

55:22.173 --> 55:24.641
then he lost
to a one-handed fighter.

55:24.675 --> 55:26.010
Pretty much.

55:26.043 --> 55:27.878
Look, I earned my way here.

55:27.912 --> 55:29.512
Sure, you did.

55:29.546 --> 55:31.248
The hell
is that supposed to mean?

55:31.282 --> 55:33.550
C'mon, man, everybody knows
that promoters

55:33.583 --> 55:36.519
use you to draw big crowds
and match you up with bums.

55:36.553 --> 55:37.553
It's no secret.

55:39.589 --> 55:41.591
Okay, if you're so sure
then take the fight.

55:44.128 --> 55:45.696
You don't seem to get it do you.

55:46.563 --> 55:49.266
You're a sideshow,
a marketing ploy.

55:49.300 --> 55:51.035
You're giving
real fighters a bad name.

55:51.068 --> 55:53.146
- This sideshow's about to beat your ass!
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

55:53.170 --> 55:54.739
Alright,
we're not taking the bait,

55:54.772 --> 55:55.782
and we are not taking the fight.

55:55.806 --> 55:58.075
Now you guys need to
get out of here right now.

55:58.109 --> 55:59.143
Now!

55:59.176 --> 56:00.745
This isn't over.

56:00.778 --> 56:02.880
We're going to take this
to the XFC!

56:02.913 --> 56:04.048
Yeah, yeah, good luck.

56:04.081 --> 56:05.648
Come on, let's go!
Come on, Nick.

56:05.683 --> 56:07.685
Go! Get the hell out of here.

56:08.352 --> 56:10.553
Nice meeting you.

56:18.696 --> 56:19.764
Hey, guy.

56:19.797 --> 56:22.199
Hey, uh, I got some bad news.

56:22.233 --> 56:25.269
Uh, XFC has
a new sanctioning board

56:25.302 --> 56:27.204
and after looking at
our application

56:27.238 --> 56:31.075
they've, uh, announced they're
not going to sanction a fight.

56:32.710 --> 56:33.677
What?

56:33.711 --> 56:36.847
Yeah, yeah, they're denying
your right to fight.

56:40.251 --> 56:42.820
No, no. They can't...
they can't do that.

56:42.853 --> 56:44.131
- I know.
- Look, I earned my way here.

56:44.155 --> 56:45.332
- You did.
- They cannot do that.

56:45.356 --> 56:46.257
You did, I know.

56:46.290 --> 56:48.659
Let's-let's step over here
and talk about it.

56:56.633 --> 56:58.135
I mean, what the hell
is the point

56:58.169 --> 56:59.713
of having rankings if they're
not going to honor them?

56:59.737 --> 57:01.739
I understand, okay.
Let's-let's stay calm

57:01.772 --> 57:03.274
and try to think this through.

57:03.307 --> 57:05.743
Nick's a contender
for the title, this is his shot.

57:05.776 --> 57:07.978
Of course it is, alright,
no one's doubting that,

57:08.012 --> 57:09.880
it's just this is
a new sanctioning board

57:09.914 --> 57:13.084
and they've been told
a different story.

57:13.117 --> 57:15.853
They just think the XFC has been
using Nick as a publicity stunt.

57:15.886 --> 57:18.222
- Man, this is such bullshit.
- Of course it is.

57:18.255 --> 57:22.326
You beat legitimate guys:
Maze, Butler, you whipped them.

57:22.359 --> 57:25.696
Okay, then why?
Why can't I fight?

57:25.729 --> 57:28.065
They're just afraid
that if these rumors go public

57:28.099 --> 57:31.135
and you get hurt during a fight,
then their credibility is shot,

57:31.168 --> 57:33.938
not to mention
lawsuits up the ass.

57:33.971 --> 57:35.673
What can we do?

57:35.706 --> 57:37.775
Well, you can petition
the board, ask for a hearing.

57:37.808 --> 57:39.043
Stand up for yourself.

57:42.880 --> 57:46.851
Gentlemen,
welcome to our XFC board.

57:46.884 --> 57:47.985
Please, have a seat.

57:52.022 --> 57:55.893
We, uh...
we have sworn testimony

57:55.926 --> 57:59.897
from Nick's last three opponents
that those fights were legit.

57:59.930 --> 58:02.199
Nick won them fair and square

58:02.233 --> 58:05.002
no matter what you might
have heard. Here.

58:06.971 --> 58:08.281
What incentive
would these fighters

58:08.305 --> 58:09.940
have to say
anything differently?

58:09.974 --> 58:11.408
It would ruin their reputations.

58:11.442 --> 58:13.077
Wait, so you think
they're lying?

58:13.110 --> 58:15.880
Mr. Newell,
wait your turn, please.

58:15.913 --> 58:18.315
No, I'm not gonna wait my turn.

58:18.349 --> 58:20.751
You guys
are messing with my career.

58:20.784 --> 58:22.028
You're taking away
my livelihood.

58:22.052 --> 58:23.020
I am the one
that has to live with

58:23.053 --> 58:25.890
the consequences
of your decisions, not you.

58:27.124 --> 58:28.359
I want to be heard.

58:30.794 --> 58:31.829
Go ahead, Mr. Newell.

58:35.833 --> 58:37.701
Hi.

58:39.336 --> 58:41.939
Nick, I, um...

58:41.972 --> 58:44.808
Hi gentlemen, I'm Stacey Newell,
Nick's mother.

58:44.842 --> 58:46.810
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Newell.

58:47.511 --> 58:49.146
Ms. Newell.

58:49.180 --> 58:51.048
Sorry, Ms. Please continue.

58:52.316 --> 58:54.018
Robert M. Hensel once said

58:54.051 --> 58:55.395
that we the ones
who are challenged

58:55.419 --> 58:58.923
need to be heard, to be seen.

58:58.956 --> 59:03.994
Not as a disability, but as a person
who has and will continue to grow.

59:04.028 --> 59:10.334
To be seen not as a handicap,
but as a well intact human being.

59:11.902 --> 59:14.872
Ma'am, I'm not sure
we understand what you mean.

59:14.905 --> 59:17.007
It means that if he had
two good hands

59:17.041 --> 59:19.343
would we be
even having this hearing?

59:19.376 --> 59:21.879
The first priority
is the safety of our fighters.

59:21.912 --> 59:24.215
I appreciate that, I do.

59:24.248 --> 59:28.385
And no one is more concerned
about Nick's health than I am.

59:28.419 --> 59:30.354
I must admit,
there's a small part of me

59:30.387 --> 59:32.823
that wants you
to deny him his license,

59:33.991 --> 59:35.960
but that is a mother speaking.

59:35.993 --> 59:39.396
And I forget that he
is no longer a little boy

59:39.430 --> 59:43.133
struggling with a disability,
but a man who has overcome it.

59:44.902 --> 59:48.138
Nick has the right to live
the life he wants to live

59:48.172 --> 59:50.374
and to have the career
he wants to pursue.

59:50.407 --> 59:53.877
Especially since he's proven
that he can handle it.

59:56.547 --> 1:00:00.150
We appreciate your input and it will
be noted. Thank you, Ms. Newell.

1:00:00.184 --> 1:00:05.289
Excuse me... you might be surprised
how many supporters Nick has.

1:00:07.091 --> 1:00:09.059
And how much press
a one-armed fighter could get

1:00:09.093 --> 1:00:12.896
if he's being denied his dreams and
told that he can't fight anymore.

1:00:12.930 --> 1:00:17.067
I'm sure that there are countless news
outlets, social media, TV, newspapers,

1:00:17.101 --> 1:00:18.969
that would really love to
hear this story.

1:00:20.237 --> 1:00:22.006
Let's not make threats now.

1:00:22.039 --> 1:00:24.908
I'm not making threats,
I'm making promises.

1:00:26.243 --> 1:00:28.078
Thank you, Ms. Newell,

1:00:28.112 --> 1:00:30.247
we will take this
under advisement.

1:00:31.849 --> 1:00:33.550
Let's go. Let's go.

1:00:43.927 --> 1:00:45.896
Hey, Vito, how are you doing?

1:00:45.929 --> 1:00:47.464
Alex.

1:00:47.498 --> 1:00:49.042
It's good to see you,
it's been a while.

1:00:49.066 --> 1:00:52.102
- Good to see you, too.
- Yeah, can we talk?

1:00:53.370 --> 1:00:55.205
Chris, could you
give us a moment?

1:00:57.074 --> 1:01:00.110
Thanks, man.
It's about Nick Newell.

1:01:00.144 --> 1:01:02.446
I figured that.

1:01:02.479 --> 1:01:05.382
You need to know
that this kid's the real deal.

1:01:05.416 --> 1:01:10.220
Every fighter that he's taken on
has been legit, and he has not lost.

1:01:10.254 --> 1:01:11.522
I don't know if he's gonna.

1:01:12.890 --> 1:01:15.993
Alright? He won't let you down,

1:01:16.026 --> 1:01:18.829
I'm not sure he's gonna
disappoint anybody ever.

1:01:20.898 --> 1:01:26.537
Look, I just... I need you
to do me this favor, that's all.

1:01:26.570 --> 1:01:30.274
I've never asked you
for anything, you know that.

1:01:30.307 --> 1:01:33.010
- Ever.
- Alex, I appreciate it.

1:01:33.043 --> 1:01:36.347
I really do.
Let me see what I can do.

1:01:37.548 --> 1:01:38.548
Alright.

1:01:40.050 --> 1:01:42.619
- Hey, Alex?
- Yeah?

1:01:43.420 --> 1:01:44.656
Do me a favor,

1:01:44.689 --> 1:01:46.957
have your people
keep a lid on this

1:01:46.990 --> 1:01:48.392
until we sort things out.

1:01:51.261 --> 1:01:52.896
I'll see what I can do.

1:02:10.614 --> 1:02:14.284
Okay. You guys good?

1:02:14.952 --> 1:02:16.053
Yeah.

1:02:16.086 --> 1:02:17.588
Okay.

1:02:17.621 --> 1:02:18.922
Alright, what are they...

1:02:18.956 --> 1:02:20.033
- Still haven't called.
- No? Okay.

1:02:20.057 --> 1:02:20.725
That's okay.

1:02:20.759 --> 1:02:22.694
They get busy you know, it's...

1:02:22.727 --> 1:02:25.028
- They're gonna call. What time is it?
- Yeah.

1:02:25.062 --> 1:02:27.598
It's a little after 2:00.

1:02:27.631 --> 1:02:28.631
Nick.

1:02:30.234 --> 1:02:31.268
Pick it up.

1:02:36.306 --> 1:02:37.441
Hello?

1:02:39.643 --> 1:02:41.445
Yeah, yeah, this is him.

1:02:48.285 --> 1:02:49.353
I understand.

1:02:52.589 --> 1:02:54.925
And that's your final decision?

1:03:00.130 --> 1:03:01.198
Okay.

1:03:03.133 --> 1:03:08.005
Alright, yeah. Okay. You too.

1:03:14.746 --> 1:03:15.746
Well?

1:03:18.015 --> 1:03:19.383
I'm gonna fight.

1:03:19.416 --> 1:03:22.619
Oh, you got me.

1:03:25.222 --> 1:03:26.523
You got me.

1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:33.464
- Oh, my gosh.
- We've got to get to work right away, hm?

1:03:33.497 --> 1:03:35.399
- Yeah.
- Look familiar?

1:03:39.603 --> 1:03:41.238
Go say something.

1:03:51.816 --> 1:03:52.983
Excuse me.

1:03:54.651 --> 1:03:56.386
You're Notorious Nick Newell!

1:03:58.222 --> 1:04:00.324
Yeah, so I've been told.

1:04:00.357 --> 1:04:01.358
What's your name?

1:04:01.391 --> 1:04:02.794
I'm Eli.

1:04:02.827 --> 1:04:05.195
Eli.
Well, nice to meet you, Eli.

1:04:05.229 --> 1:04:06.396
Nice to meet you, too.

1:04:07.531 --> 1:04:09.667
Look, Eli...

1:04:11.335 --> 1:04:12.670
I'm fighting
for the championship.

1:04:12.704 --> 1:04:16.006
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?

1:04:17.341 --> 1:04:20.177
- Wanna come to a fight?
- Mom can I?

1:04:20.210 --> 1:04:21.278
Yes.

1:04:21.311 --> 1:04:22.479
Awesome.

1:04:23.614 --> 1:04:25.315
You do any fighting yourself?

1:04:25.349 --> 1:04:28.051
- Nah, I'm a baseball pitcher.
- Okay, cool.

1:04:28.085 --> 1:04:29.586
But I'm not a very good one.

1:04:30.621 --> 1:04:31.723
Yeah? Why is that?

1:04:31.756 --> 1:04:33.725
Is something
wrong with your eyes?

1:04:38.796 --> 1:04:40.564
Do you love baseball, Eli?

1:04:41.398 --> 1:04:43.100
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:04:43.835 --> 1:04:45.202
Then stick with it.

1:04:46.838 --> 1:04:50.340
You know, someone once told me
that if you love something

1:04:50.374 --> 1:04:51.618
you may have to work
twice as hard

1:04:51.642 --> 1:04:54.746
as everyone else,
but it's worth it.

1:04:56.613 --> 1:04:57.614
Don't you ever give up.

1:04:59.449 --> 1:05:01.184
I believe in you.

1:05:02.152 --> 1:05:03.186
Alright?

1:05:04.154 --> 1:05:05.289
Alright.

1:05:05.322 --> 1:05:06.432
It was nice to meet you guys.

1:05:06.456 --> 1:05:07.500
I'll see you at the fight, okay.

1:05:07.524 --> 1:05:08.764
- I'll see you there.
- Alright.

1:05:15.499 --> 1:05:18.502
Yeah! Up, up, up, up.

1:05:18.535 --> 1:05:19.837
Pull, pull, pull.

1:05:19.871 --> 1:05:21.381
Do you want it?
You've got to take it, man.

1:05:21.405 --> 1:05:22.372
You've got to take it.

1:05:22.406 --> 1:05:24.107
Stay active.

1:05:24.141 --> 1:05:25.642
Keep working, keep working.

1:05:26.811 --> 1:05:28.211
Grind!

1:05:30.414 --> 1:05:33.785
Yep, yep, yep. Yep.

1:05:33.818 --> 1:05:36.119
Alright. Alright, alright,
settle, settle.

1:05:37.387 --> 1:05:38.522
No worries.

1:05:38.555 --> 1:05:40.825
Just stay calm, breathe easy.

1:05:40.858 --> 1:05:44.561
What's our transition?
Our transition.

1:05:44.595 --> 1:05:46.898
We need to transition
into omoplata. Alright?

1:05:46.931 --> 1:05:48.298
Yeah.

1:05:48.332 --> 1:05:49.572
Okay, alright, let me show you.

1:05:51.435 --> 1:05:52.770
Alright, come here.

1:05:54.806 --> 1:05:57.174
Alright, so you've got him
in a triangle.

1:05:57.207 --> 1:05:59.376
- Yeah.
- Huh, lock your arm back here.

1:05:59.409 --> 1:06:03.347
Alright, so if you can't finish
the triangle past your left leg,

1:06:03.380 --> 1:06:06.216
over his head like this.
Sit up in omoplata.

1:06:06.249 --> 1:06:08.418
- Huh? Now he's done.
- Just crank right there?

1:06:08.452 --> 1:06:10.855
Yup, right here. You got it?

1:06:10.888 --> 1:06:12.556
Questions, comments, concerns?

1:06:12.589 --> 1:06:13.825
No.

1:06:13.858 --> 1:06:15.192
Your turn.

1:06:19.563 --> 1:06:21.666
- Okay, there's triangle.
- Yup, triangle.

1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:25.670
- So when he goes to defend it...
- Uh-huh.

1:06:26.738 --> 1:06:28.305
Trap the arm.

1:06:29.707 --> 1:06:31.308
Yes, that's it.

1:06:31.341 --> 1:06:33.377
Yep, you got it, great job.

1:06:33.410 --> 1:06:36.580
You got it.
That's good. Nice job.

1:07:36.808 --> 1:07:39.342
Elbow, hook, elbow, hook.

1:07:39.376 --> 1:07:41.311
Elbow, hook. Elbow, hook.

1:07:41.344 --> 1:07:43.881
Alright. Okay, that's it.

1:07:44.749 --> 1:07:45.749
Alright, take a seat.

1:07:46.884 --> 1:07:48.452
Alright, listen to me.

1:07:49.586 --> 1:07:51.354
You need to have
patience tonight.

1:07:51.388 --> 1:07:52.622
Believe in the game plan.

1:07:52.657 --> 1:07:54.391
Don't blow all your energy

1:07:54.424 --> 1:07:56.027
in one big adrenaline dump.

1:07:56.060 --> 1:07:57.829
Trust that you did
all you could do

1:07:57.862 --> 1:08:00.430
to get ready
for this fight. Huh?

1:08:00.464 --> 1:08:03.467
And I want you to know,
that no matter what happens tonight,

1:08:03.500 --> 1:08:04.769
I couldn't be prouder of you.

1:08:06.738 --> 1:08:08.505
Questions, comments, concerns?

1:08:11.441 --> 1:08:12.777
Thank you, Coach.

1:08:14.611 --> 1:08:16.246
Thank you for everything.

1:08:33.396 --> 1:08:36.968
Whoo! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'm the champ!

1:08:37.001 --> 1:08:38.635
I'm the champ, it's my time!

1:08:38.669 --> 1:08:41.973
Let's go! Whoo! Yeah!
Hell, yeah!

1:08:56.620 --> 1:08:58.288
I fear no man.

1:09:01.692 --> 1:09:03.460
No beast or evil.

1:09:18.776 --> 1:09:20.044
It's time, Nick.

1:09:37.128 --> 1:09:39.429
It's a big night
at the XFC arena,

1:09:39.462 --> 1:09:42.033
as Nick Newell facing off
against Rich Reynolds

1:09:42.066 --> 1:09:43.768
for the lightweight
championship belt.

1:09:43.801 --> 1:09:45.045
Yeah, this should be
a great one.

1:09:45.069 --> 1:09:49.040
Newell is talented,
but Reynolds is an animal.

1:09:49.073 --> 1:09:52.143
He might be a little bit too polished
and experienced though for Newell.

1:09:52.176 --> 1:09:54.979
Well, we'll see, it's a championship
match that means five rounds.

1:09:55.012 --> 1:09:56.948
Yeah, and Newell
is a big underdog in this one.

1:09:56.981 --> 1:09:59.884
Most experts think that he won't
even make it out of that first round.

1:10:23.107 --> 1:10:24.541
Hey, it's time.

1:10:55.907 --> 1:10:57.675
Mom, Mom, there he is!

1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:16.961
Tape.

1:11:22.166 --> 1:11:25.836
Cup. Mouthpiece.
Extra mouthpiece.

1:11:32.910 --> 1:11:33.910
You understand the rules?

1:11:34.979 --> 1:11:36.113
Have a good fight.

1:12:12.950 --> 1:12:15.920
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:12:15.953 --> 1:12:21.558
welcome to the XFC
World Championship Event.

1:12:21.591 --> 1:12:25.628
And now the moment
you have all been waiting for.

1:12:25.663 --> 1:12:30.600
With a professional record
of eight wins, no losses,

1:12:30.633 --> 1:12:35.773
the Notorious Nick Newell.

1:12:40.211 --> 1:12:42.612
And from the other corner,

1:12:42.645 --> 1:12:46.050
the XFC's Lightweight Champion
of the World,

1:12:46.083 --> 1:12:49.820
with an undefeated record
of 16-0,

1:12:49.854 --> 1:12:53.691
it's Rich "It's a Wrap"
Reynolds.

1:12:59.864 --> 1:13:01.165
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1:13:01.198 --> 1:13:02.632
Have a good fight.

1:13:03.701 --> 1:13:04.701
You ready?

1:13:05.269 --> 1:13:06.670
Have a good fight.

1:13:22.787 --> 1:13:25.322
Okay, guys, let's have
a good clean fight.

1:13:25.356 --> 1:13:27.992
Tap gloves, and go back
to your corners.

1:13:28.025 --> 1:13:30.261
Let me show you what
a real fighter's about, chump.

1:13:31.128 --> 1:13:32.163
Hey.

1:13:32.196 --> 1:13:34.597
Oh, no love loss
between these two.

1:13:34.631 --> 1:13:36.734
The crowd is really
looking forward to this fight.

1:13:36.767 --> 1:13:38.278
I just hope Newell
can hang in there long enough

1:13:38.302 --> 1:13:39.582
to give them
their money's worth.

1:14:07.298 --> 1:14:09.300
Remember, patience, Nick.

1:14:09.333 --> 1:14:11.235
Stay clear of his right hand.
Wear him out!

1:14:16.373 --> 1:14:17.607
You ready?

1:14:18.275 --> 1:14:19.910
You ready?

1:14:19.944 --> 1:14:21.644
Fight.

1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:38.429
Wow, Newell in trouble
almost immediately.

1:14:38.462 --> 1:14:40.865
One clean blow from Reynolds,
and this could be the end.

1:14:48.372 --> 1:14:50.808
Don't panic!
Remember what we practiced!

1:15:37.855 --> 1:15:40.224
Break it up, break it up. Break it up.

1:15:45.763 --> 1:15:48.866
Nick. Nick, Nick.

1:15:48.899 --> 1:15:51.268
Play our game,
don't play his game.

1:15:51.302 --> 1:15:52.870
You've got to
stay out of his reach

1:15:52.903 --> 1:15:54.004
until he throws a punch,

1:15:54.038 --> 1:15:55.839
then go in
and hit him with a combo.

1:15:55.873 --> 1:15:57.875
Alright?
If he takes you down again,

1:15:57.908 --> 1:15:58.842
stay off your back!

1:15:58.876 --> 1:16:00.411
You're exerting too much energy.

1:16:00.444 --> 1:16:02.746
Newell looks spent
after just one round.

1:16:02.780 --> 1:16:05.091
Yeah, the champ is putting on
tremendous pressure on Newell.

1:16:05.115 --> 1:16:06.875
I'd be surprised to see
the end of round two.

1:16:22.933 --> 1:16:24.333
Ooh, a hard right
to Reynolds' head.

1:16:27.438 --> 1:16:29.873
Another right
to the champ's head!

1:16:41.952 --> 1:16:43.454
The champ is down!

1:16:43.487 --> 1:16:44.922
Take him down!

1:16:44.955 --> 1:16:46.090
Get off the ground, Richie!

1:16:47.958 --> 1:16:49.193
Come on, Nick!

1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:13.250
It's over now, Reynolds has him
in his patented leg lock.

1:17:13.284 --> 1:17:16.220
Newell is gonna have to tap here or
he is in for some serious damage.

1:17:16.253 --> 1:17:17.921
Get out of it, Nick,
get out of it!

1:17:20.190 --> 1:17:21.558
You can do it, Nick!

1:17:21.592 --> 1:17:23.160
He's going to roll, Rich!

1:17:28.265 --> 1:17:30.968
Come on, come on, come on.
Hang tight, Nick, come on.

1:17:31.001 --> 1:17:33.137
The round's almost over.
Come on, hang on!

1:17:35.472 --> 1:17:37.107
Fifteen seconds!

1:17:41.645 --> 1:17:43.814
You got him.
You got him, just hold on.

1:17:54.892 --> 1:17:58.862
Newell is limping badly,
he's got 60 seconds to recover.

1:17:58.896 --> 1:18:00.336
Not sure that's gonna be
enough time.

1:18:10.641 --> 1:18:12.276
How's the leg, son?

1:18:14.111 --> 1:18:15.412
I'm good to go.

1:18:17.147 --> 1:18:18.515
Does that hurt?

1:18:20.150 --> 1:18:21.285
No.

1:18:23.153 --> 1:18:26.190
Alright. Good luck.

1:18:33.063 --> 1:18:35.165
I didn't come this far to lose.

1:18:39.203 --> 1:18:41.472
Just tell me if you can't go on.

1:18:43.708 --> 1:18:46.543
- I can win this.
- I believe you.

1:18:46.577 --> 1:18:49.113
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick...

1:18:49.146 --> 1:18:53.050
Hear that? They believe you, too.

1:19:05.996 --> 1:19:08.098
Well, we know who the crowd
is rooting for.

1:19:08.132 --> 1:19:10.577
Yeah, Newell had a hard time
getting sanctioned for this fight,

1:19:10.601 --> 1:19:15.105
but he's shown today that he is a
true warrior, no one can deny that.

1:19:15.139 --> 1:19:17.819
Yeah, no doubt, but I'm not sure
how much longer this can go on for.

1:19:49.540 --> 1:19:51.308
Wrestle, Nick, wrestle!

1:19:52.276 --> 1:19:54.378
Wrestle, goddammit!

1:20:08.258 --> 1:20:11.228
My God, Newell has Reynolds
in a rear naked choke!

1:20:11.261 --> 1:20:12.963
That came out of nowhere!

1:20:14.565 --> 1:20:16.099
Come on, Nick, you can do it!

1:20:18.435 --> 1:20:21.138
Hold on. Hold on!

1:20:23.173 --> 1:20:25.008
You've got him, Nick!

1:20:25.042 --> 1:20:27.144
Come on, come on, choke him out,
Nick, come on!

1:20:27.177 --> 1:20:30.113
He may have this,
Reynolds can't break the hold.

1:20:34.051 --> 1:20:35.753
He's done, you're done.

1:20:35.787 --> 1:20:39.022
That's it! The fight is over!

1:20:40.257 --> 1:20:42.292
Yeah!

1:20:43.060 --> 1:20:43.795
Ah!

1:20:43.828 --> 1:20:45.529
Yeah!

1:20:45.562 --> 1:20:48.632
Oh! Whoo!

1:20:51.736 --> 1:20:53.303
This is unbelievable!

1:20:53.337 --> 1:20:56.640
Newell won,
he actually won the fight!

1:21:04.816 --> 1:21:09.286
You've just witnessed one of the
greatest upsets in sports history!

1:21:09.854 --> 1:21:11.455
Oh, my God!

1:21:11.488 --> 1:21:14.358
Oh, my God! Oh, my...

1:21:14.391 --> 1:21:16.761
That's my son! That's my boy!

1:21:20.597 --> 1:21:22.533
Yes, yes, yes!

1:21:25.302 --> 1:21:29.439
Unbelievable!
There are no words to describe this!

1:21:33.610 --> 1:21:35.078
Mom, can I go?

1:21:36.346 --> 1:21:40.050
You did it! You did it!
Yes! Whoo!

1:22:01.138 --> 1:22:04.508
We did it. You did it, it's yours.
It's yours.

1:22:15.152 --> 1:22:16.253
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:22:16.286 --> 1:22:18.255
your new XFC champion,

1:22:18.288 --> 1:22:20.591
Notorious Nick Newell.

1:22:43.715 --> 1:22:45.415
Abi, we did it.

1:23:00.197 --> 1:23:03.367
I don't think my story is any
more special than anyone else.

1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:05.737
You know, um, the truth is,

1:23:05.770 --> 1:23:08.405
<i>you know, I am a one-handed guy
and I had these problems,</i>

1:23:08.438 --> 1:23:10.340
<i>and I had these obstacles,
and I overcame them</i>

1:23:10.374 --> 1:23:12.744
to become something and make
something out of myself.

1:23:12.777 --> 1:23:15.512
<i>His just... his internal drive.</i>

1:23:15.545 --> 1:23:17.414
<i>He wanted to be the best,</i>

1:23:17.447 --> 1:23:19.650
he wanted to be...
He wanted to improve.

1:23:19.684 --> 1:23:21.351
He fell in love with the sport.

1:23:21.385 --> 1:23:22.930
Uh, I can remember
when he called me and said,

1:23:22.954 --> 1:23:23.888
"Oh, I started training MMA,"

1:23:23.921 --> 1:23:25.699
and I was like "What the...
What are you doing?"

1:23:25.723 --> 1:23:28.291
It all actually happened.
It's not like he made it up.

1:23:28.325 --> 1:23:30.360
You know, and if anybody
thinks it's fake,

1:23:30.394 --> 1:23:32.462
they can come to Connecticut
and come to his gym

1:23:32.496 --> 1:23:34.231
and look on the wall
and see the belt.

1:23:34.264 --> 1:23:35.967
It is main event time.

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:40.337
"Notorious" Nick Newell versus
"It's a Wrap" Eric Reynolds.

1:23:40.370 --> 1:23:44.341
We are set for five rounds.
The championship at 155 pounds.

1:23:44.374 --> 1:23:48.913
Southpaw start, as always,
for Notorious Nick Newell.

1:23:48.946 --> 1:23:50.948
He starts off
with some solid leg kicks, Pat.

1:23:50.982 --> 1:23:53.417
Newell said he worked a
lot on his kicks for this fight.

1:23:54.886 --> 1:23:56.353
He'll try to muscle his way

1:23:56.386 --> 1:23:58.355
and get Eric Reynolds
onto his back.

1:23:58.388 --> 1:24:00.490
There's a high left round kick
from Nick Newell.

1:24:00.524 --> 1:24:02.727
Overhand right from Newell
and Reynolds fires back

1:24:02.760 --> 1:24:04.327
with a right hand of his own.

1:24:04.361 --> 1:24:05.863
High left round kick
from Newell.

1:24:08.365 --> 1:24:10.968
Newell tries to
catch the kicking leg.

1:24:11.002 --> 1:24:12.770
He's trying to lock onto
his arm there.

1:24:12.804 --> 1:24:14.782
He's got it locked,
let's see what he does with it.

1:24:14.806 --> 1:24:16.373
Come on, Nick!

1:24:16.406 --> 1:24:18.442
Oh, suplex!

1:24:18.475 --> 1:24:20.912
Oh, it's a back suplex there
from Nick Newell.

1:24:20.945 --> 1:24:23.447
This is where Nick Newell
is so good.

1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:25.582
There's the arm
under the chin now.

1:24:25.615 --> 1:24:28.585
The hooks are in
for Notorious Nick Newell.

1:24:28.618 --> 1:24:30.788
Is he on his way
to a world championship?

1:24:30.822 --> 1:24:32.389
This is where it's an advantage

1:24:32.422 --> 1:24:33.791
because he can't get
hand control

1:24:33.825 --> 1:24:35.325
on that shorter arm.

1:24:35.358 --> 1:24:36.798
He's pulling down
on the gloved hand,

1:24:36.828 --> 1:24:38.261
but that's already trapped.

1:24:38.295 --> 1:24:40.530
Reynolds in trouble!

1:24:40.564 --> 1:24:41.875
- Reynolds taps out!
- That's it, that's it!

1:24:41.899 --> 1:24:44.634
It's goodnight, Irene!

1:24:44.669 --> 1:24:47.872
The fairy tale comes true!

1:24:47.905 --> 1:24:50.808
Winner blue,
tap out, by rear naked choke.

1:24:50.842 --> 1:24:55.278
Nick Newell is the XFC champion!

1:24:55.312 --> 1:24:58.548
A standing ovation
here in Nashville!

1:24:58.582 --> 1:24:59.784
Nice fight, brother.

1:24:59.817 --> 1:25:02.019
That kid is happy.

1:25:02.053 --> 1:25:04.689
Nashville
has gone into meltdown!

1:25:04.722 --> 1:25:07.058
Nick Newell
has gone into ecstasy!
