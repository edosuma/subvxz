WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:06.040
CHANCE:
Eldon Chance is a 55-year-old,
right-handed neuropsychiatrist.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.076
Of late,
he is increasingly aware

00:08.109 --> 00:11.045
of a mental state he finds
to be dark and unstable.

00:11.079 --> 00:14.382
This is D.
D, meet Dr. Chance.

00:14.415 --> 00:17.017
CHANCE: Do you remember
that furniture we looked at?
D: I do.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.819
You decide
you want to make it right?

00:18.852 --> 00:21.555
CHANCE: Jaclyn Blackstone
is a 39-year-old

00:21.589 --> 00:23.491
ambidextrous woman
living in Berkeley.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.226
with complaints
of intermittent memory loss,

00:25.259 --> 00:27.595
poor concentration,
loss of time.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.231
It says here that you separated
from your husband

00:30.264 --> 00:31.832
after he struck you
in the face.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.501
Shortly thereafter,

00:33.534 --> 00:36.337
you became aware of a second
personality -- Jackie Black.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.905
You were in her room
just now.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.173
Why didn't you
look in on her?

00:39.207 --> 00:40.508
He'll kill me.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.210
He said he would,
and I believe him.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.112
This was big,
even coming here.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.113
It could be for you, too.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.680
I could be putting us
both in danger.

00:46.714 --> 00:47.948
I was trying
to help someone.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.783
I will not accept

00:49.817 --> 00:51.919
this problem
cannot be solved.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.254
Let's walk.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.755
This is not good.
I don't like this.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.190
If anyone starts
shooting, duck.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.792
Otherwise,
don't fuckin' move.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.161
(knife plunges)

01:06.234 --> 01:08.736
**

01:17.445 --> 01:19.447
(bell clanging)

01:37.798 --> 01:40.334
(bell clanging)

01:54.315 --> 01:56.817
(indistinct shouting
in distance)

02:12.132 --> 02:13.834
(cellphone clicks)

02:13.867 --> 02:15.936
What are you doing?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.505
Calling 911.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.440
Get that kid
an ambulance back there.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.641
Don't.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.511
I'm a doctor,
for Christ's sake.

02:23.544 --> 02:27.181
You're in the database.
I'm not.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.583
If you really want
to call someone, use that.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.021
(cellphone beeping, ringing)

02:34.054 --> 02:36.524
WOMAN: 911.
What's your emergency?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.025
There's uh --

02:38.058 --> 02:40.561
there's three guys in an alley
in the Tenderloin

02:40.594 --> 02:42.496
that need medical attention.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.732
Can you give me
an address?

02:44.765 --> 02:48.135
Uh, it's an alley
in the Tenderloin.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.538
Can you be
more specific, sir?

02:50.571 --> 02:53.407
In between 23rd and 24th.
Enter off Mercer.

02:53.441 --> 02:56.076
Okay, and--
(cellphone beeps)

02:56.109 --> 02:58.646
Do you feel better?

02:58.679 --> 03:01.782
You want some water?

03:04.084 --> 03:06.019
Back there.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.455
What's that about?

03:10.358 --> 03:13.193
That was about
me getting right.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.796
What you do with it
is up to you.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.099
(keys jingling)

03:26.907 --> 03:31.211
This cop -- this cheap fuck
gun-and-a-badge tough guy,

03:31.245 --> 03:34.415
I'd like to see him
meet me somewhere.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.850
What?!

03:36.884 --> 03:38.852
What are you saying?

03:38.886 --> 03:43.457
That what you just did
was some kind of aud-- audition?

03:43.491 --> 03:45.426
No.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.729
Why? The rules?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.464
You think
that's how he feels?

03:50.498 --> 03:54.935
Those guys back there, how'd
you know they wouldn't be armed?

03:54.968 --> 03:56.437
How'd you know
they wouldn't have guns?

03:56.470 --> 03:58.506
That it wouldn't be
the two of us left for dead?

04:04.244 --> 04:08.081
Oh, fuck!

04:08.115 --> 04:11.385
Most fights are over
before they start.

04:11.419 --> 04:14.054
Those guys followed us
into an alley.

04:14.087 --> 04:19.126
What kind of idiot goes into
a blind alley to escape?

04:19.159 --> 04:21.462
Emotion over logic.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.230
They didn't think.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.300
They just reacted,
so they let me dictate.

04:26.334 --> 04:29.269
There are no victims.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.372
Only volunteers.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.693
(sighs)

04:52.726 --> 04:53.794
(clang)

04:57.331 --> 05:00.067
(sighs)

06:20.481 --> 06:21.749
D?

06:23.316 --> 06:25.385
D!

06:33.827 --> 06:35.128
Jaclyn.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.531
Jaclyn.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.799
Jaclyn!

06:40.468 --> 06:41.935
Man does like his scalps.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.037
(dishes rattling)

06:44.071 --> 06:47.975
(water running)

06:48.008 --> 06:52.079
(sighs)

06:55.983 --> 06:57.250
Morning.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.455
I wouldn't have stayed late
at the office last night

07:01.489 --> 07:03.290
if I'd known
you were gonna be here.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.592
Well, I said I would

07:04.625 --> 07:07.294
if Mom and Neil
ended up going to the movie.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.998
Remember how I said that?

07:11.031 --> 07:13.501
Although they didn't actually
go out to one.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.768
They ordered one on TV

07:14.802 --> 07:17.104
and pretty much took over
the living room.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.405
Again.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.074
He's living with us now,
I guess.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.510
Neil is?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.945
Yeah. I mean,
he basically was already,

07:24.978 --> 07:31.018
but he found somebody to sublet
his place, so it's official.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.021
Hey,
how accurate is this thing?

07:34.054 --> 07:35.589
The Beck Depression
Inventory?

07:35.623 --> 07:38.692
It's kind of weird.

07:38.726 --> 07:39.760
Like, I don't get how,

07:39.793 --> 07:41.995
"I make decisions
about as well as I ever could"

07:42.029 --> 07:46.099
is the answer that's supposed
to show you're not depressed.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.367
But I do seriously have

07:47.400 --> 07:49.937
basically no interest
in other people, though.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.774
And I definitely feel more
discouraged about my future

07:53.807 --> 07:54.975
than I used to.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.343
You know,
when I administer that test,

07:56.376 --> 07:58.378
it's in conjunction
with other tests.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.346
It's cumulative.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.883
It's not
a stand-alone diagnostic.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.351
You look pretty bad.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.854
Thanks.
I slept in a chair.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.023
Well, last time
I stayed over,

08:10.057 --> 08:12.125
you said the next time
there would be a futon couch

08:12.159 --> 08:13.861
or something
for me to sleep on.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.664
Guess what.
There isn't.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.533
Plus, are you ever gonna unpack
these other boxes?

08:19.567 --> 08:20.467
It's been months.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.636
I mean, if you didn't need
any of this stuff,

08:22.670 --> 08:25.205
then why'd you even take it?
Okay, who's for pancakes?

08:25.238 --> 08:26.674
And coffee.
You don't have any.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.809
What do you mean?
I -- I have coffee.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.078
You have that stuff that tastes
like burning earthworm dirt.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.346
Also, there's none left.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.682
We have to go now,
though.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.084
I have 10 demerits already
this semester.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.285
For what?

08:39.386 --> 08:43.657
Talking in the library
and being late.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.525
You have something
on your shirt.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.434
(buttons clattering)

08:56.203 --> 08:57.838
NICOLE:
Are we going?!

08:57.871 --> 09:00.808
Yeah, just --
just give me one second.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.618
Dad!
Yeah!

09:10.651 --> 09:13.253
I'll be right there.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.474
(brakes squeak)

09:38.345 --> 09:41.381
SUZANNE: I waited in line
45 minutes for these.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.617
They don't have them
on the menu every day.

09:43.651 --> 09:44.952
Come on.
You haven't taken one bite.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.821
Yeah, my stomach's
not feeling great.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.624
So anyway, I called the
Alameda County D.A.'s office.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.926
Volunteered to do
the psych evals, profiles,

09:52.960 --> 09:54.561
whatever they need,
pro bono.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.164
Okay.
If I can get
a friend there,

09:57.197 --> 10:00.567
maybe I can put that friend
onto Raymond Blackstone.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.003
If he's as dirty
as Jaclyn says he is.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.839
If Blackstone is even close
to what she says,

10:05.873 --> 10:07.775
how is he not gonna find out
you're poking around?

10:07.808 --> 10:09.509
'Cause he doesn't work there.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.411
He can't have his finger
in everything.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.814
Okay, so you said
you had two things.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.448
What's the other thing?

10:15.482 --> 10:17.818
Jaclyn tutors math.

10:17.851 --> 10:23.190
Now, if she came to my
apartment, says it's for that,

10:23.223 --> 10:27.294
you could meet her there
to continue her therapy.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.529
At your apartment?

10:29.562 --> 10:32.833
Ye--
it doesn't have to be there.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.434
The point is
to set up some cover

10:34.467 --> 10:36.203
that allows you and her
to keep meeting.

10:36.236 --> 10:40.774
Do you really still not see
what dangerous ground this is?

10:40.808 --> 10:43.210
Even for someone
without your history,

10:43.243 --> 10:45.645
your vulnerability,
it would be.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.681
Or is that
what you like about it?

10:47.715 --> 10:49.983
Come on, Suzanne.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.318
Jaclyn wouldn't be
the first

10:51.351 --> 10:52.786
to trade in one abusive man
for another.

10:52.820 --> 10:53.854
Remember you said that?

10:55.689 --> 10:59.126
So maybe Jackie Black
and all the rest of her story

10:59.159 --> 11:03.063
is just about finding one man
to save her from another.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.498
You don't believe
in Jackie Black?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.035
I don't know
what I believe.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.470
Well, Jaclyn
or Jackie Black

11:10.503 --> 11:13.173
or however many of her
there are or aren't,

11:13.206 --> 11:14.507
I can't imagine
any of them

11:14.541 --> 11:16.643
would want to go on
getting beaten.

11:16.676 --> 11:21.048
Eldon,
why can't you let this go?

11:21.081 --> 11:24.251
That's what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to let go.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.486
I'm trying to give Jaclyn
to you.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.620
She needs help,

11:27.654 --> 11:31.058
and I'm trying to find a way
to let you keep helping her.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.762
Or we can --
we can just hope for the best.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.902
I'm taking yours home,
too.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.504
Did her other therapist go
to this much trouble for her?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.574
Myra something.
What was her name?

11:47.607 --> 11:49.409
Cohen, I think.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.011
Yeah, Cohen.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.914
What happened there again?
She -- she died?

11:53.947 --> 11:58.385
Yeah. She was an older woman,
lived alone.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.353
On the Internet, the police said
that they thought

12:00.387 --> 12:02.856
she might have tried to stop
a home-invasion robbery.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.759
Wow. Poor woman.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.296
That couldn't have been easy
for Jaclyn, either.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.064
Is that a yes?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.302
I just hope
you know what we're doing.

12:17.670 --> 12:21.241
(door opens)

12:21.274 --> 12:23.777
(door closes)

12:46.766 --> 12:48.335
(ringing)

12:48.368 --> 12:50.303
JACLYN: Hello?

12:50.337 --> 12:54.074
Hi, Jaclyn.
This is Eldon Chance.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.576
Listen,
I might have an idea

12:56.609 --> 12:59.246
about how you could continue
your therapy.

12:59.279 --> 13:03.250
(Up-tempo dance music playing)

13:03.283 --> 13:05.919
Is -- Is this a good time?

13:05.953 --> 13:08.088
You mean now?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.957
I'm at work right now.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.793
Now, later,
whenever is convenient.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.497
I'll call you back.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.699
Okay. When --

13:19.732 --> 13:23.136
This isn't a good number,
just so you know.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.473
(receiver clicks)

13:36.349 --> 13:39.786
(birds squawking)

13:39.819 --> 13:43.290
CHANCE: Bernard Jolly
is a 19-year-old white male

13:43.323 --> 13:46.226
who, until his recent arrest
and incarceration,

13:46.259 --> 13:47.895
has lived
in the basement apartment

13:47.928 --> 13:51.364
of his maternal aunt,
Amanda Jolly of San Francisco.

13:51.398 --> 13:55.402
He is two years
into a post-concussive syndrome

13:55.435 --> 13:57.370
following a basilar
skull fracture

13:57.404 --> 13:59.006
and intracerebral hematoma

13:59.039 --> 14:01.308
following a bicycle/
pickup truck accident

14:01.341 --> 14:04.311
in which he was riding
the bicycle.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.879
(sighs)

14:05.913 --> 14:07.747
Since his discharge,
the patient admits

14:07.780 --> 14:11.418
to both visual
and olfactory hallucinations.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.021
Visual hallucinations
consist most often

14:14.054 --> 14:16.823
of seeing the Mexican gardener
who struck him,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.425
even though Jolly
has been informed

14:18.458 --> 14:20.727
that this man
has since left the country.

14:22.729 --> 14:23.997
(tires squealing,
horns honking)

14:24.031 --> 14:26.699
(screams)

14:32.372 --> 14:37.177
On top of that, various
olfactory hallucinations.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.579
What kind of olfactory
hallucinations does he have?

14:39.612 --> 14:41.514
Incense, hay,

14:41.548 --> 14:45.385
and something he describes as
the smell of different beings.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.587
Yeah, I get that
every time I'm on BART.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.123
(chuckles)
Okay, so headline.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.758
If competency means
that Bernard Jolly

14:51.791 --> 14:54.194
could communicate effectively
with his attorney...

14:54.227 --> 14:56.463
Then, no,
he's not competent.

14:56.496 --> 15:01.434
You think you could write
that up for me by Thursday?

15:01.468 --> 15:03.971
Sure. I'd be happy to help
with anything else.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.705
Yeah? 'Cause just off
the top of my head,

15:05.738 --> 15:08.708
I got 10 more defendants
where Bernie Jolly came from.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.110
Fine.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.745
I could also walk you
through medical histories

15:12.779 --> 15:14.147
that seem confusing, too.

15:14.181 --> 15:17.150
When you fell down from heaven,
did it hurt a lot?

15:19.119 --> 15:22.322
Listen,
does the D.A.'s office work

15:22.355 --> 15:24.992
with all the Alameda County
police departments?

15:25.025 --> 15:26.960
Yeah. Oakland, Berkeley,
Hayward -- all of them.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.562
They keep us busy.
Gonna keep you busy now, too.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.964
Okay, how come?

15:33.466 --> 15:37.304
I was just wondering,
it's --

15:37.337 --> 15:41.674
Colleague of mine was murdered,
and the case is still unsolved.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.344
I know
it's probably inappropriate.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.079
Where was this?

15:46.113 --> 15:48.681
Fremont. 2014.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.351
We'd have that file here.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.852
You can't take it with you,

15:52.885 --> 15:55.622
but we'd probably have a room
you could sit with it.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.024
That work?
Sure.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.491
Done.

15:58.525 --> 16:02.462
CHANCE:
Myra Cohen, PhD.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.498
Stab wounds
penetrating vital structures.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.201
Total number of stab wounds --
43.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.470
Nine classified as major.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.672
Hands tied in front
using a double square knot

16:12.705 --> 16:14.041
with white nylon rope

16:14.074 --> 16:17.444
approximately
42 inches in length.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.147
Discovered subsequently
at the coroner's office

16:20.180 --> 16:23.650
that Dr. Cohen had a kitchen
knife embedded in her throat.

16:23.683 --> 16:24.984
It was undetected at the scene

16:25.018 --> 16:27.687
because of the pillowcase
over her head.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.599
(bell chimes)

16:42.435 --> 16:45.505
(tires squealing in distance)

16:45.538 --> 16:48.041
(car doors close)

16:52.079 --> 16:54.481
MAN: Sorry.
I got no time to fuck around.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.349
This is what I tell him.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.151
300 degrees,

16:58.185 --> 17:01.721
and the beer is pouring out of
me from the night before, right?

17:01.754 --> 17:03.890
And you know me,
I'm just gonna say to him,

17:03.923 --> 17:06.693
you're gonna tell me where
I can find this guy right now.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.330
'Cause if you don't,
I swear to Jesus Christ,

17:10.363 --> 17:12.199
I will come across
this table,

17:12.232 --> 17:14.434
and I will rip your heart
right out of your fucking chest!

17:14.467 --> 17:18.171
(laughter)

17:18.205 --> 17:21.074
The little piece of shit looked
like he was gonna piss himself.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.576
(indistinct conversation)

17:23.610 --> 17:26.113
(laughter)

17:49.636 --> 17:52.139
(cellphone ringing)

17:56.809 --> 17:58.077
Hello?

17:58.111 --> 18:00.813
Hi.
It's Jaclyn.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.649
Sorry it took me so long
to call back.

18:02.682 --> 18:06.085
No, no, that's --
that's fine, really.

18:06.119 --> 18:10.123
I was calling to --
I talked to Suzanne Simms,

18:10.157 --> 18:12.959
and we came up with a plan

18:12.992 --> 18:14.661
to help you keep going
with therapy.

18:14.694 --> 18:20.066
Would you -- are you up
for that, you think?

18:20.099 --> 18:23.436
Uh, tomorrow night,
there's a lecture on the campus,

18:23.470 --> 18:24.771
the math department.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.140
I was planning to go.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.142
One of the graduate students
is lecturing

18:29.176 --> 18:33.546
on the axiom of choice,
if you'd like to come.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.585
I -- I'm afraid
that would be lost on me.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.852
Sure.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.266
There's a Chinese place
on Shattuck

18:53.300 --> 18:55.468
that's close to the campus.
Do you --

18:55.502 --> 18:57.704
Taizu Dragon.
That's the one.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.939
We could meet there after.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.841
We could.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.777
At 8:30.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.113
8:30 it is.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.649
(receiver clicks)

19:09.682 --> 19:12.185
(cellphone clicks)

19:40.880 --> 19:42.882
(horn honks)

20:00.066 --> 20:02.068
(bell clangs)

20:02.101 --> 20:03.903
Hey.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.938
LUCY: Where were you?

20:05.972 --> 20:07.039
When?

20:07.073 --> 20:09.175
Randall -- your 9:00.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.577
I called you
a ton of times.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.779
Shit.
I didn't hear it.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.180
Uh, we better reschedule.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.215
Friday at 11:00.
That's good.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.117
I know it is.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.554
Also, a detective called
for you.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.590
What?

20:23.623 --> 20:24.857
Detective Hynes.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.626
Did he say
what was it about?

20:26.659 --> 20:28.261
No.
Just that you're in trouble.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.931
(sighs)
Myra Cohen.

20:31.964 --> 20:35.468
He -- He said it's about
the Myra Cohen case.

20:35.502 --> 20:39.472
Right. Yeah, I -- I asked
about that at the D.A.'s office.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.707
Do you want me to get him
for you?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.442
No, it's okay.
I'll call him later.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.076
He wanted your cell.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.446
Did you give it to him?

20:46.479 --> 20:49.616
Yeah. I just give out your cell
number to whoever wants it.

20:51.518 --> 20:55.888
You would tell me if there's
something going on, right?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.324
Going on with what?

20:57.357 --> 20:59.158
You.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.863
I like to think I would,
yes.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.134
The Sykes guardianship call
is at noon.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.236
I'll dial you in.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.671
Thank you.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.206
(door closes)

21:19.846 --> 21:25.251
CHANCE:
The patient states that Jackie
is daring and extroverted,

21:25.284 --> 21:27.620
a person who comes out
in times of stress.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.989
In particular,
it is Jackie who continues

21:30.022 --> 21:33.092
to have a sexual relationship
with her estranged husband

21:33.125 --> 21:36.663
even though she, Jaclyn,
does not approve of this.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.188
(water dripping)

22:02.221 --> 22:04.424
(cellphone ringing)

22:06.225 --> 22:08.461
(cellphone clicks)
Hello?

22:08.495 --> 22:11.864
CARL:
Young man, do you have time
to stop by and see me?

22:11.898 --> 22:14.467
Uh, when were you
thinking?

22:14.501 --> 22:17.336
Well, what are you up to
right now?

22:17.370 --> 22:20.172
I-I don't really --

22:20.206 --> 22:23.142
You do so,
and you won't be sorry.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.779
I got news that's too beautiful
not to share.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.952
(bell chimes)

22:34.621 --> 22:37.890
(speaking indistinctly)

22:39.792 --> 22:41.861
I have a man
who can do the restoration.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.996
He does fantastic work.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.865
(bell chimes)

22:45.898 --> 22:47.867
Big dog.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.436
Hey.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.904
Hey.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.174
There are victims.

22:55.207 --> 23:00.079
I spend half my life
in rooms with them.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.549
They do exist,
they do think,

23:02.582 --> 23:04.684
and they react

23:04.717 --> 23:10.690
to being bereft of protectors
and damaged beyond repair.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.459
Your furniture's gone.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.627
What?
Yesterday.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.797
I thought
that's why you were here.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.365
CARL:
All right. Bye for now.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.768
My friend.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.804
Would a cashier's check
in the amount of $80,000

23:24.837 --> 23:26.105
brighten your day?

23:30.910 --> 23:34.313
A Mr. Morozov
of San Francisco.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.916
Is he Russian?
He's rich,
and he's happy.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.551
Ah.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.086
And he's not in the mob.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.153
You sure about that?

23:41.187 --> 23:43.389
'Cause I read an article
in the Chronicle.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.325
I've held back $20,000 for D's
work and my own commission.

23:48.595 --> 23:49.829
And that's a deal.

23:49.862 --> 23:53.566
I know, and D's work
is not the issue.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.968
He's entitled to whatever
is fair, and you are, too.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.937
What is the issue?

23:59.772 --> 24:02.675
I just -- I thought there
would be a time, you know,

24:02.709 --> 24:04.443
when you had the buyer,

24:04.477 --> 24:08.915
and there would be a final
moment to reconsider before...

24:08.948 --> 24:11.951
It's what we agreed upon.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.953
It's why we did the work.

24:15.888 --> 24:19.626
I've made you a little something
to remember them by.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.270
I thought
you would be happier.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.841
When I pictured your face,
you were smiling.

24:40.513 --> 24:45.151
MAN: Three major fault lines,
and shit tons of minor ones,

24:45.184 --> 24:47.353
and they all meet right here
in the fucking Bay Area, man.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.220
How's that for freaky?

24:48.254 --> 24:50.557
I was reading
about something like that

24:50.590 --> 24:52.058
somewhere recently, yeah.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.226
I think about us being,
like, years past due

24:54.260 --> 24:55.194
for a seismic event

24:55.227 --> 24:57.363
of catastrophic
fucking proportions.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.398
I think about it
all the time.

24:59.431 --> 25:02.468
What would you do?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.904
If it happened?

25:04.937 --> 25:06.138
Nothing.

25:06.172 --> 25:09.075
Probably drown, right?
(chuckles)

25:09.108 --> 25:10.643
But what am I gonna do?

25:10.677 --> 25:13.580
But it just seems like
there's a lot of people

25:13.613 --> 25:16.248
afraid of bullshit,
you know?

25:16.282 --> 25:17.884
If you're gonna be afraid,

25:17.917 --> 25:20.186
be afraid of something
that could actually happen.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.221
That's what I am.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.757
Yeah.
Me too.

25:30.563 --> 25:33.232
Carl Allan here.
Please leave a message.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.935
Hi, Carl.
It's Eldon Chance.

25:35.968 --> 25:39.772
Listen, I've been thinking
about what we...

25:41.741 --> 25:45.511
I have to make this right
with the buyer, the Russian.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.214
I'm not gonna put any of this
on you or on D.

25:48.247 --> 25:51.250
I'll explain.
I'll say it was all on me.

25:51.283 --> 25:55.354
I'll tell him that the pieces --
they had brass on them

25:55.387 --> 25:57.189
when I brought it to you.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.391
I'm gonna offer him
his money back.

25:59.425 --> 26:03.763
Whatever it takes
to put right what we did.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.867
I'm sorry, really.
I...

26:07.900 --> 26:12.639
It's just, ethically speaking,
all of this...

26:12.672 --> 26:16.142
this is not who I am.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.483
(fog horn blows)

26:28.755 --> 26:30.156
(door opens)

26:30.189 --> 26:32.291
Hi.
Hey. How you doing?

26:40.099 --> 26:42.301
(door opens)

26:45.304 --> 26:46.605
Hey.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.485
You expecting someone?

27:08.194 --> 27:11.463
We met at the hospital.
You were looking in on my wife.

27:13.666 --> 27:17.770
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, I remember you now.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.505
You remember me now.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.640
As opposed to
when you saw me walk in?

27:21.674 --> 27:25.177
Yeah,
you looked familiar.

27:25.211 --> 27:28.715
I see a lot of people
in the course of my day.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.683
You mind?

27:30.717 --> 27:33.920
WOMAN:
Can I get you gentlemen --
No. We're good. Thank you.

27:39.258 --> 27:40.526
Let me see.

27:47.533 --> 27:50.036
Is this what they would call
Art Deco?

27:50.069 --> 27:51.904
It's French Art Deco.

27:51.938 --> 27:55.007
French Art Deco.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.675
These are yours?

27:56.709 --> 27:58.310
Yeah.
Well, uh, no.

27:58.344 --> 28:02.014
It -- It was,
but I just sold it.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.983
Hope you got your price.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.852
Yeah.
So do I.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.756
What brings you to our side
of the bay, Doctor?

28:09.789 --> 28:14.326
You know, I-I sometimes
see patients up here.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.262
I like being on the campus
now and then.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.930
Reminds me
of my student days.

28:17.964 --> 28:21.033
Are you on staff at any
of the hospitals over here?

28:22.434 --> 28:24.103
No.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.305
I used to be,
but I'm not anymore.

28:32.544 --> 28:37.016
I was asked by your wife's
therapist to look in on her,

28:37.049 --> 28:38.384
'cause she was worried

28:38.417 --> 28:40.352
that there might be some trauma
to the brain.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.722
The doctors might have missed
it, so that's why I was there.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.861
Well, I didn't mean
to intrude.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.429
I just saw you sitting
over here,

28:50.462 --> 28:51.730
thought I'd come over
and say hello.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.299
You said
you were meeting someone?

28:53.332 --> 28:57.436
No.
Actually, I didn't say that.

28:57.469 --> 28:58.604
Not at all.

28:58.637 --> 29:00.539
(door opens)
Hm.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.674
Oh, look.

29:03.675 --> 29:05.277
I guess
it started raining.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.579
Weather report's
finally right.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.083
(door opens)
Oh.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.919
(thunder rumbling)

29:12.952 --> 29:14.653
Well, well, well.

29:14.686 --> 29:15.922
Jackie!

29:32.872 --> 29:34.606
Look who I found.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.276
Hi.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.279
Hi.
How are you?

29:40.312 --> 29:42.514
Dr. Chance was just about to
tell me who he was waiting for.

29:42.548 --> 29:47.419
No, I was just saying
that I'm not meeting anyone.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.421
It's a coincidence, then.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.424
You'd be amazed at how
many coincidences I hear
about in my line of work,

29:52.458 --> 29:56.462
and you'd be amazed at
how often it turns out that
they're not coincidences.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.664
I'm getting to the point
where I don't even believe
in such things.

29:58.697 --> 30:00.032
Here. Have a seat.

30:05.071 --> 30:08.007
You know,
it's not really a question

30:08.040 --> 30:09.708
of believing
or not believing.

30:09.741 --> 30:12.278
Coincidence is the simple
condition of coinciding.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.014
Any number of people
or things

30:15.047 --> 30:18.384
occupying the same space
at the same point in time.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.186
Right.

30:20.219 --> 30:23.122
You want me to give you
an example?

30:23.155 --> 30:25.858
Please.

30:25.892 --> 30:29.228
There's a guy
rehanging a light fixture

30:29.261 --> 30:31.063
in the lobby
of an upscale hotel.

30:32.698 --> 30:35.902
For whatever reason,
he gets distracted,

30:35.935 --> 30:37.736
and he doesn't do
the job right --

30:37.769 --> 30:39.171
leaves some screws
out of the assembly.

30:40.406 --> 30:44.410
Some time later,
a woman is crossing the lobby

30:44.443 --> 30:47.046
on her way to join some friends
at the bar.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.580
She passes under the light

30:48.614 --> 30:51.918
at the point which
a construction crew outside

30:51.951 --> 30:53.752
start using a jackhammer,

30:53.785 --> 30:56.923
and it vibrates the building
very slightly...

30:56.956 --> 30:59.525
(woman screams)
...but enough.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.528
Then what happened?
She die?

31:02.561 --> 31:03.930
No.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.999
The impact caused
a subarachnoid hemorrhage

31:07.033 --> 31:09.268
resulting in global aphasia.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.369
She was never
the same again.

31:10.402 --> 31:13.205
I see it all the time --

31:13.239 --> 31:16.275
people's lives changed
irrevocably.

31:16.308 --> 31:20.246
I sometimes wonder if
it's by that kind of geometry

31:20.279 --> 31:22.614
that our lives
are our lives,

31:22.648 --> 31:25.717
those random meetings in time
and space.

31:25.751 --> 31:29.088
It's just
purest coincidence.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.224
And they call him
Dr. Chance.

31:32.258 --> 31:35.094
So we're not responsible
for our own actions, then?

31:35.127 --> 31:36.528
Is that the point?

31:36.562 --> 31:38.264
'Cause I've heard that one
a few times, too.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.767
You know, someone
once asked William James

31:41.800 --> 31:43.269
if he believed in free will.

31:43.302 --> 31:46.438
And he said, "Of course.
What choice do I have?"

31:46.472 --> 31:51.310
(chuckling)
That's good.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.611
He's all right.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.414
How was the lecture?

31:55.447 --> 32:00.052
It was good.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.088
That's it?
That's all you got?

32:02.121 --> 32:03.255
Tell us about it.

32:04.656 --> 32:07.326
Graduate student
from the math department

32:07.359 --> 32:10.096
was lecturing
on the Banach-Tarski paradox

32:10.129 --> 32:12.431
and the axiom of choice.

32:12.464 --> 32:15.901
Really? Why?

32:15.934 --> 32:18.770
Would you care,
I mean.

32:20.139 --> 32:25.611
It's a counterintuitive
theorem.

32:25.644 --> 32:29.181
A solid ball
in three-dimensional space

32:29.215 --> 32:34.586
can be split up
into a finite amount

32:34.620 --> 32:37.523
of non-overlapping pieces,

32:37.556 --> 32:39.425
which can then be
put back together

32:39.458 --> 32:44.796
so as to yield two identical
copies of the same sphere.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.699
(laughs)
Fuck me.

32:47.733 --> 32:51.270
I never understood why
she puts herself through it.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.538
Are you hungry or what?

32:52.571 --> 32:54.640
I came for takeout.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.442
There are papers
I need to read for tomorrow.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.311
Go up and order it.
I'll be up in a second to pay.

32:59.345 --> 33:02.581
That won't be necessary.
Forget about it.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.885
It was nice
to see you again.

33:06.918 --> 33:09.255
Yeah.
You too.

33:11.157 --> 33:15.661
We've been living separately,
but then you probably knew that.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.297
No, I did not know that.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.632
I'm not
your wife's therapist.

33:20.666 --> 33:23.702
I was trying to determine
the extent of her injuries.

33:26.205 --> 33:31.009
Speaking of which, they ever
find the person responsible?

33:31.043 --> 33:33.745
Whatever you're having here,
I'm gonna pick it up.

33:33.779 --> 33:34.880
It'll be my treat.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.915
I couldn't possibly
let you do that.
Of course you can.

33:36.948 --> 33:39.551
You were kind enough
to look in on my wife.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.321
And no, we have not yet found
the person responsible,

33:42.354 --> 33:43.422
but we will.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.291
You can take that
to the bank.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.695
Hey, let me ask you, Dr. Chance,
are you a married man?

33:49.728 --> 33:50.896
Divorcing.

33:50.929 --> 33:54.066
Children?
I have a daughter, yeah.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.268
I don't envy you that.

33:57.903 --> 34:00.439
You know, it's rough out there.
You know what I'm trying to say.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.508
I mean...

34:02.541 --> 34:04.510
we're a predatory species,
Doctor.

34:04.543 --> 34:08.046
That's not what they teach you
in the hallowed halls on campus,

34:08.080 --> 34:11.550
and as a cop, that's not
what I'd say to the press,

34:11.583 --> 34:14.453
but it's the truth.

34:14.486 --> 34:18.924
I mean, that's the world
I deal with every day, right?

34:21.227 --> 34:26.031
And next time we coincide
like this...

34:26.064 --> 34:28.367
that's on you.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.902
Okay?

35:25.524 --> 35:28.026
(doorbell rings)

35:33.965 --> 35:36.202
Hi.

35:36.235 --> 35:39.671
Uh, I just wanted to see Nikki,
to say good night to Nikki.

35:41.707 --> 35:44.676
Uh, yeah.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.478
Okay.

35:46.512 --> 35:47.713
Nikki?

35:47.746 --> 35:50.015
You went out
to Rockridge?

35:50.048 --> 35:52.418
Yeah, I had a thing.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.321
The broker call you?

35:55.354 --> 35:57.689
Uh, well, maybe.
I haven't checked.

35:59.991 --> 36:04.196
We have like four preemptive
offers, all above asking.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.498
Great.
Yeah, it is.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.800
I mean, it doesn't solve
the whole school problem.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.970
You know, we've missed all
the deadlines for financial aid,

36:12.003 --> 36:13.405
and, really,
at this point,

36:13.439 --> 36:16.208
I don't even think she has
any options beyond Marina South.

36:16.242 --> 36:19.845
I...really didn't come here
to fight.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.914
Yeah.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.083
What would that
even look like?

36:28.254 --> 36:29.588
Hey, Dad.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.723
Hey.

36:31.757 --> 36:33.359
Anything wrong?

36:34.726 --> 36:36.995
Sometimes I just like
to see your face.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.365
Sometimes.

36:39.398 --> 36:41.500
I was in Oakland today.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.569
I came home with some more
of that coffee that you hate

36:43.602 --> 36:45.537
for actually tasting
like coffee.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.939
So, maybe we could --

36:47.973 --> 36:50.442
I need to go to bed.

36:50.476 --> 36:53.111
I have to do a tempo run
tomorrow morning.

36:53.144 --> 36:54.946
In the park?

36:54.980 --> 36:56.214
By yourself?

36:56.248 --> 36:58.917
Well, Shawn has to
do hers, too.

36:58.950 --> 37:02.621
And actually,
Neil might meet us, maybe.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.890
Just for part of it.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.692
Sometimes he runs to the gym
in the morning,

37:06.725 --> 37:08.093
and it's in
the same direction --

37:08.126 --> 37:09.528
Okay, I just wanted
to make sure

37:09.561 --> 37:12.431
that, you know,
you're not alone.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.032
Is he here now --
Neil?

37:14.065 --> 37:17.269
They ordered Thai,
and he went to pick it up.

37:17.303 --> 37:19.204
How come?

37:19.237 --> 37:21.239
It's nothing. I...

37:22.741 --> 37:26.144
I just want to say good night
and I love you.

37:26.177 --> 37:27.646
I love you, too.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.915
Good night, baby.
Good night.

37:34.119 --> 37:36.622
(dog barking in distance)

37:41.693 --> 37:44.430
CHANCE:
The axiom of choice.

37:47.198 --> 37:49.067
"An axiom of set theory

37:49.100 --> 37:52.270
allowing for the construction
of non-measurable sets.

37:52.304 --> 37:57.175
Collection of points without
volume in the ordinary sense."

37:57.208 --> 37:58.844
Why should they be?

37:58.877 --> 38:01.112
Why should any fucking thing
be ordinary?

38:01.146 --> 38:03.649
(doorbell buzzes)

38:14.860 --> 38:16.127
Yeah?

38:16.161 --> 38:18.664
(buzzing)

38:21.400 --> 38:23.168
Hello?

38:23.201 --> 38:25.704
(buzzing)

38:29.207 --> 38:30.976
Who is this?

38:31.009 --> 38:33.512
(buzzing)

38:49.094 --> 38:51.963
(door squeaks open
in distance)

38:51.997 --> 38:53.832
(door closes)

39:31.970 --> 39:34.473
(footsteps approaching)

39:57.829 --> 39:59.431
You're my knight.

39:59.465 --> 40:01.933
(dramatic music plays)
