human evolution was
at a turning point.

the process by which
the strongest, the smartest,

to thin the herd,

with huge guns protecting us,
okay?

51:31.088 --> 51:32.957
So don't worry.
You're safe.

51:33.023 --> 51:36.194
And you know what?
It's none of my business,
but when we get back,

51:36.261 --> 51:39.063
you and Upgrayedd should
seriously think about
couples counseling, okay?

51:39.130 --> 51:43.468
And you should also think about
maybe finding an art manager
who's not also your boyfriend.

51:43.534 --> 51:47.672
Hey!
She's not puttin' out?

51:47.738 --> 51:51.976
Uh, no, she is.
We, uh-- We already did it.

51:52.042 --> 51:54.579
Yeah. He was great.

51:56.714 --> 52:00.418
Okay. Hey, a couple of us guys
were wonderin', uh,

52:00.485 --> 52:02.520
if we'd go family-style
on her.

52:05.089 --> 52:08.593
Uh, yeah,
probably not right now.

52:08.659 --> 52:12.830
We should focus on the crops.
So let's get back to work.
Maybe later.

52:19.170 --> 52:20.838
What the hell is this?

52:23.808 --> 52:27.678
- Tastes like Gatorade.
- [ Rita ]
Is that that Brawndo stuff?

52:27.745 --> 52:31.516
[ Joe ]
They're watering crops
with a sports drink?

52:33.117 --> 52:35.953
[ Narrator ]
Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator
had come to replace water...

52:36.020 --> 52:38.223
virtually everywhere.

52:38.289 --> 52:40.525
Water, the basic component
of all life,

52:40.591 --> 52:43.594
had been deemed a threat
to Brawndo's profit margin.

52:43.661 --> 52:47.298
The solution came during
the budget crisis of 2330...

52:47.365 --> 52:52.102
when the Brawndo Corporation
simply bought the F.D.A....

52:52.169 --> 52:53.638
and the F.C.C....

52:53.704 --> 52:56.040
enabling them to say,
do and sell...

52:56.106 --> 52:57.942
anything they wanted.

53:03.113 --> 53:05.750
Joe didn't know
any of this,

53:05.816 --> 53:09.854
but he did see a problem
that he might actually
be able to solve.

53:09.920 --> 53:14.459
[ Indistinct ]
With his options running out,
Joe took a bold step.

53:14.525 --> 53:16.827
He would not
get out of the way.

53:16.894 --> 53:19.630
This time, he would lead.

53:19.697 --> 53:21.766
For the last time,
I'm pretty sure...

53:21.832 --> 53:24.902
what's killing the crops
is this Brawndo stuff.

53:24.969 --> 53:27.738
But Brawndo's got
what plants crave.
It's got electrolytes.

53:27.805 --> 53:29.874
So wait a minute.
What you're saying...

53:29.940 --> 53:33.778
is that you want us
to put water on the crops.

53:33.844 --> 53:37.047
- Yes.
- Water.
Like out the toilet?

53:37.114 --> 53:41.051
Well, I mean, it doesn't
have to be out of the toilet,
but, yeah, that's the idea.

53:41.118 --> 53:44.622
- But Brawndo's got
what plants crave.
- It's got electrolytes.

53:44.689 --> 53:46.491
Okay, look.

53:46.557 --> 53:50.194
The plants aren't growing,
so I'm pretty sure that
the Brawndo's not working.

53:50.261 --> 53:54.932
Now, I'm no botanist,
but I do know that if you put
water on plants, they grow.

53:54.999 --> 53:58.803
Well, I've never seen no plants
grow out of no toilet.

53:58.869 --> 54:02.139
Hey, that's good.
You sure you ain't
the smartest guy in the world?

54:02.206 --> 54:06.176
- [ Chuckling ]
- You wanna solve this problem.
I wanna get my pardon.

54:06.243 --> 54:10.315
So why don't we just try it,
okay, and not worry about
what plants crave?

54:10.381 --> 54:12.783
Brawndo's got
what plants crave.

54:12.850 --> 54:15.486
- Goddamn it.
- Yeah, it's got electrolytes.

54:15.553 --> 54:18.088
What are electrolytes?
Do you even know?

54:18.155 --> 54:20.858
It's what they use
to make Brawndo.

54:20.925 --> 54:23.594
Yeah, but why do they
use them to make Brawndo?

54:23.661 --> 54:26.364
'Cause Brawndo's
got electrolytes.

54:29.266 --> 54:33.771
[ Narrator ] After several
hours, Joe finally gave up
on logic and reason...

54:33.838 --> 54:36.974
and simply told the cabinet
that he could talk to plants...

54:37.041 --> 54:39.644
and that they wanted water.

54:40.678 --> 54:43.013
He made believers
out of everyone.

54:43.080 --> 54:46.817
Joe didn't know it,
but the beloved electrolytes...

54:46.884 --> 54:50.788
were salts that had been
building up in the topsoil
over the decades,

54:50.855 --> 54:53.558
killing plants
and leading to the dust bowl.

54:53.624 --> 54:59.430
As secretary of the interior,
Joe ordered all crops
to be switched to water,

54:59.497 --> 55:04.735
promising that,
over time, plants would grow
and the dust bowl would end.

55:04.802 --> 55:08.806
He was on the fast track
to a full presidential pardon.

55:08.873 --> 55:12.042
- Or so it seemed.
- [ All Shouting ]

55:13.243 --> 55:17.214
Man, I hope somethin'
grows fast.

55:17.281 --> 55:19.183
Yeah. So we can haul
our ass back home.

55:19.249 --> 55:22.887
Man. You really think
those people would have
starved to death?

55:24.355 --> 55:29.093
I don't know.
I mean, how did the world
ever get like this?

55:29.159 --> 55:33.063
You know things are bad
when they're comin' to me
for answers.

55:33.130 --> 55:35.866
- It's a weird feeling
being smarter than everyone.
- Mm-hmm.

55:35.933 --> 55:38.369
- I'm not used to it.
- Yeah. Me neither.

55:41.038 --> 55:44.675

walked around thinkin' everyone
was a bunch of dumb shits?

55:44.742 --> 55:47.478
Yeah.

he built that bomb.

Oh, hey.
I'm sorry about that.
No. No.

55:58.656 --> 56:01.859
They said that
you got me a pardon.

56:01.926 --> 56:04.862
You know, if you hadn't
done that, I'd still
be in jail right now, so...

Given enough time,
Joe's plan might have worked.

suddenly dropped to zero,

and had a total of 32 kids--

01:18:32.508 --> 01:18:35.912
thirty-two of the dumbest kids
ever to walk the earth.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:44.353
Okay, so maybe Joe
didn't save mankind,

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:46.823
but he got the ball rolling,

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:50.794
and that's pretty good
for an average guy.

01:23:50.659 --> 01:23:53.329
I'm gonna go find this ho.
