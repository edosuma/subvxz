[car door slams]

01:02.228 --> 01:04.064
[knocks]

01:04.147 --> 01:05.065
Sue?

01:05.315 --> 01:06.900
[rings doorbell]

01:06.983 --> 01:07.984
It's Marty.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.697
[knocks]

01:53.279 --> 01:54.155
Sue?

01:57.075 --> 01:58.660
Sue, are you here? It's Marty.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.418
Hello?

02:16.761 --> 02:18.221
Sue, are you back here?

05:09.934 --> 05:11.936
[theme music playing]

05:24.324 --> 05:26.951
[Charlotte] I don't understand why
we have to do community service.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.413
Well, you were arrested
and then sentenced.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.667
I think the judge was pretty lenient,
considering.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.920
So, you can't fix this?

05:38.796 --> 05:41.758
What, you want me to bribe a judge
to get you out of community service?

05:41.841 --> 05:43.634
You can just tell him who you are.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.054
It's not technically bribery
if you just introduce yourself.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.681
Okay, you both know
we have to be above reproach.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.101
We can't afford to bring
any negative attention to this family.

05:55.271 --> 05:58.107
One day, I promise
you won't have to be so careful.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.444
But for now, we have to look like
law-abiding citizens.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.030
Even though we're not.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.119
-Even though we're not.
-[Jonah scoffs]

06:11.496 --> 06:13.748
[officer]
Let me remind you that your cellphones...

06:15.083 --> 06:17.085
[officer continues chattering]

06:28.221 --> 06:29.097
Off you go.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.435
[Erin] Hi, guys.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.572
[Wendy] We need to talk.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.158
-Marriage?
-[laughs]

06:50.243 --> 06:51.119
Partnership.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.079
-Ours.
-Okay.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.998
Marty called this morning.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.918
On his way to work,
he checked in on our therapist.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.589
-She wasn't home.
-[scoffs]

07:06.134 --> 07:07.885
No, she wasn't.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.182
-We were handling it.
-Oh, were you?

07:13.391 --> 07:14.559
Because when I drove past,

07:14.642 --> 07:16.853
that fucking McLaren
was still parked outside.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.063
-That is still-- That is no reason--
-Yes, it is.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.362
[Wendy]
When you make decisions without us,

07:27.155 --> 07:29.282
you risk everything we're building here.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.660
[laughs] Oh, yeah. The brand.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.371
You and Marty are endangering the brand,

07:35.455 --> 07:38.916
and I am sick and tired
of cleaning up after your mistakes.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.920
-[sighs]
-Our partnership...

07:44.172 --> 07:46.591
it's not gonna work if you keep me
in the dark, pure and simple.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.510
[Helen] Oh, you want pure and simple?
How about this?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.097
This launch party tomorrow night

07:53.181 --> 07:55.433
and this whole foundation business,

07:55.933 --> 07:58.352
it had better yield some serious results,

07:58.436 --> 08:00.980
because I hate parties.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.891
Is this okay?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.102
I'm not gonna break.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.438
What if I do?

08:43.814 --> 08:45.399
You talk too much.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.069
[both laugh]

09:00.039 --> 09:02.041
[panting]

09:09.090 --> 09:12.552
[both moan]

09:28.317 --> 09:29.277
[Ruth laughs]

09:30.653 --> 09:31.529
Mm!

09:32.655 --> 09:35.074
[Ben sighs]

09:35.533 --> 09:36.450
[Ruth grunts]

09:38.536 --> 09:39.453
[chuckles]

09:40.288 --> 09:41.497
Morning.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.541
Hey.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.011
[Ruth chuckles]

09:56.929 --> 09:59.140
[laughing]

10:03.978 --> 10:05.062
Yeah, you know what?

10:05.730 --> 10:08.441
You know that I'm going back to work now.
You don't...

10:08.941 --> 10:11.986
You don't have to stick around
if you don't want to.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.573
You talk too much.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.992
[Ruth laughs]

10:30.171 --> 10:33.257
Rick and Marilyn Culver. They, uh...

10:33.883 --> 10:37.678
They run a small-scale foreclosure
relief service out of Lee's Summit.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.805
They're, uh-- They're nice folks.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.641
They prey mostly on the elderly.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.809
Particularly those with cognitive issues.

10:43.893 --> 10:47.188
They've had a half a dozen complaints
thrown out over the last decade,

10:47.271 --> 10:50.566
because their clients
couldn't even remember what they signed.

10:51.692 --> 10:52.985
Sad story.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.530
Yeah, it's very sad.
Someone should do something about it.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.741
Well, you know it won't be me.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.160
Yeah.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.454
Yeah, I know.

11:03.537 --> 11:07.792
That's why I did some forensic accounting
of my own on them,

11:07.875 --> 11:10.670
and, Maya, the stuff that came up,

11:10.753 --> 11:14.048
uh, you know,
there's offshore savings accounts,

11:14.131 --> 11:16.842
there are suspect
whole insurance policies,

11:16.926 --> 11:19.428
there's a family trust in the Caymans.

11:20.096 --> 11:24.767
You turn this in, the IRS can
get these guys on tax evasion alone.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.812
-Don't you have a casino to run?
-Mm-hmm.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.230
Or money to launder?

11:29.897 --> 11:32.817
You said you wanted off my case.
You told me to do good.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.112
I also told you
that this is not how it works.

11:36.904 --> 11:40.032
You can't have your cake
and avoid prison, too.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.203
That's cute.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.417
Marty, do you understand
what you're asking me to do?

11:49.875 --> 11:51.502
Yeah, fight the good fight.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.380
No, you're asking me
to be someone I'm not...

11:54.797 --> 11:56.215
at my core.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.176
Come on. Please.

12:00.594 --> 12:01.887
I'm just not willing to do that.

12:02.596 --> 12:03.931
I want to do my job here

12:04.014 --> 12:06.392
and be able to look at myself
in the mirror every morning.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.395
Okay.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.356
Well, um, all I know is that...

12:13.190 --> 12:16.110
it felt real good when
the FBI got a bead on Blink Check.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.820
And this is gonna feel good, too.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.874
-[Ben shouts]
-[both laughing]

12:29.957 --> 12:30.958
[tires screech]

12:36.881 --> 12:37.965
[Ben] You okay?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.387
I'll be fine.

12:50.644 --> 12:51.812
I'll see you later.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.541
So, I want the canapés off the floor

13:12.625 --> 13:15.127
-about 20 minutes before Wade's speech.
-Absolutely.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.339
And then, I need you to circulate
with fresh champagne. Okay?

13:18.923 --> 13:20.132
-Thank you.
-[Ruth] Tell me,

13:20.216 --> 13:22.760
why do rich folks need
so much money spent on them

13:22.885 --> 13:25.846
before they'll even think about
going in their own pocket?

13:26.180 --> 13:28.390
That is a very good question.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.311
Welcome back. Hmm?

13:32.394 --> 13:34.814
Sure you're ready for this?
You can take more time if you want.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.483
Yeah, absolutely. Whatever you need.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.237
I'm fine, really.

13:41.695 --> 13:42.905
-[Marty] Yeah?
-I want to work.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.242
[Marty] Okay. That's great, uh,

13:46.408 --> 13:48.494
'cause there's a lot of work.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.830
You ready? Um...

13:51.038 --> 13:53.040
I need you to talk to the limo company.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.125
I don't want anyone waiting
at the airport,

13:55.209 --> 13:57.461
and these guys keep saying
they can get it done with five cars.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.255
I just... I don't know.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.218
Dumb fucker thinks every ride
takes 30 minutes.

14:04.593 --> 14:05.636
What else?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.221
Um...

14:07.471 --> 14:11.225
I'm gonna need to pull a few staff
out of the restaurant to work the party,

14:11.308 --> 14:12.810
so can you look at the rotation for me?

14:13.477 --> 14:17.273
You mean stop Sidney and Diane coming here
trying to a bag a rich husband?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.275
That's exactly right.
When you're done with that...

14:19.358 --> 14:20.776
Come here for a second, look at this.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.405
...I need you to go down to the caterers,
have them deliver new champagne flutes.

14:24.488 --> 14:28.200
These look like they got washed with sand.
Not great. Okay?

14:28.367 --> 14:29.368
Yeah.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.122
You got it.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.102
Benjamin Davis to see Frank Cosgrove Jr.

14:55.436 --> 14:59.523
Sir, Mr. Cosgrove is still not available.
Now stop coming back here every day.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.569
How do you know he's not available?
Did you call his office?

15:13.412 --> 15:14.496
[man] Ben Davis.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.836
-Mr. Cosgrove is not available.
-Fuck you!

15:20.920 --> 15:23.505
Sir, you-- Hey! Hey!

15:27.051 --> 15:28.260
Yeah, he just blew through.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.307
Oh, shit.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.851
[men shouting]

15:37.311 --> 15:39.355
-Shit!
-[tires screech]

15:41.440 --> 15:43.567
And here we are.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.947
[laughs] So, once the mixer dies down,

15:48.030 --> 15:51.408
I'll make a few introductions,
and then you can take the stage.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.871
How has the response been
from across the aisle?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.081
Good, good.

15:57.164 --> 16:00.709
No, we targeted all the donors
that Charles Wilkes rubbed the wrong way.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.088
-So, there'll be a lot of people here.
-[both laugh]

16:04.171 --> 16:06.131
[Wendy]
You know, I ran a lot of campaigns,

16:06.215 --> 16:07.841
and, I mean, over time, I've just--

16:07.925 --> 16:09.802
I've learned what people really want.

16:10.594 --> 16:11.512
And what's that?

16:13.180 --> 16:14.056
Courage.

16:16.058 --> 16:16.934
Courage...

16:17.351 --> 16:20.396
for your family, for your state,
for your country.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.023
I mean, if you lack courage,
you are doomed.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.359
Is that a challenge?

16:26.151 --> 16:30.114
[laughs] In a way. Yeah.

16:30.197 --> 16:33.325
Oh, I have an addition
for your speech tomorrow night.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.370
It's, uh--
It's a potential bipartisan initiative.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.747
This one's on the Foreclosure Relief Fund.

16:39.790 --> 16:40.708
Just so you know,

16:40.791 --> 16:44.003
we tried to give this
to the FBI agent who's running our audit.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.879
We thought the Bureau
might be interested,

16:45.963 --> 16:49.133
but she basically told us to go fuck off.
[chuckles]

16:54.054 --> 16:55.472
What was the agent's name?

16:56.098 --> 16:57.933
Uh, Miller. Miller.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.727
Special Agent Maya Miller.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.484
[Charlotte]
Community service was so disgusting.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.821
I found an astronaut diaper.

17:10.904 --> 17:11.947
Oh, Jesus.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.033
How'd you know it was an astronaut diaper?

17:14.700 --> 17:17.411
-It said "NASA" on it.
-Got it.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.413
Hmm. I found this.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.331
This is supposed to be community service,

17:21.415 --> 17:23.250
-not a treasure hunt.
-Thought you'd want it back.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.253
-Oh, look at that.
-[Charlotte] Hmm.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.755
Great, thank you.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.175
Oh, by the way, I blame Mom
for making us pick up the trash.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.604
It is okay to talk about Mom.
We're still a family, okay?

17:43.687 --> 17:46.523
And we both decided
that you guys should be doing this.

17:47.983 --> 17:50.903
Are you and Mom gonna get a divorce?

17:51.695 --> 17:55.157
Look, no matter what happens,
we are still your parents.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.535
We still love you,
and we will still work together, okay?

17:58.619 --> 18:00.454
You'll still have community service.

18:02.581 --> 18:03.832
What happened to therapy?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.586
You promised you'd go.

18:07.669 --> 18:08.754
We-- We did,

18:08.837 --> 18:11.840
uh, but, you know,
she was not the world's best fit.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.218
-So...
-[Charlotte mutters]

18:15.385 --> 18:17.763
Does your boss know
you and Mom are separated?

18:18.472 --> 18:19.807
Won't he be angry?

18:19.890 --> 18:21.642
You don't have to worry about that.
Seriously.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.937
We're doing a great job for him.
He's happy. Let's just relax.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.022
We'll enjoy a nice family dinner, okay?

18:27.564 --> 18:28.732
Yeah, without Mom.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.192
Charlotte.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.036
Hi, can I see a list of your whiskeys?

18:41.745 --> 18:42.955
You're looking at 'em.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.091
[Ben] Another beer, please.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.471
Just give me a single malt.
Anything from the Highlands.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.889
And a water back, of course.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.059
[bottle pops open]

19:12.151 --> 19:14.736
[hissing through teeth]

19:18.991 --> 19:20.409
That's a nice tie.

19:22.870 --> 19:23.787
Thanks.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.916
I was being sarcastic.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.168
So was I.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.503
[bartender] Hey, you guys,
cut the shit, okay?

19:42.097 --> 19:44.725
I mean, a really fucking nice tie.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.685
Do you got a problem?

19:46.768 --> 19:48.770
[grunting]

19:56.028 --> 19:58.238
[grunting continues]

20:00.991 --> 20:02.993
Nice tie, motherfucker!

20:05.704 --> 20:07.706
[cell phone ringing]

20:15.297 --> 20:16.131
Marty?

20:16.381 --> 20:18.717
[Helen] <i>No, it's me. Your partner.</i>

20:22.346 --> 20:24.056
It is two o'clock in the morning.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.183
<i>Actually, it's almost three.</i>

20:26.683 --> 20:28.852
I'm outside a Kansas City police station

20:28.936 --> 20:31.271
where I'm about to serve
as the attorney of record

20:31.355 --> 20:33.232
in an assault case for your brother,

20:33.690 --> 20:37.277
<i>who told the Kansas City PD that I was,</i>
<i>and I quote,</i>

20:37.361 --> 20:38.820
<i>"the family lawyer."</i>

20:41.156 --> 20:42.282
Fuck.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.534
<i>-Exactly.</i>
-[sighs]

20:44.618 --> 20:46.912
<i>He's facing two counts of felony assault.</i>

20:47.287 --> 20:49.248
<i>Disturbing the peace</i>
<i>and drunk and disorderly.</i>

20:49.331 --> 20:52.584
<i>And an outstanding North Carolina</i>
<i>bench warrant</i>

20:52.668 --> 20:54.962
<i>for a misdemeanor assault</i>
<i>and property damage.</i>

20:55.045 --> 20:56.213
<i>Did you know about that?</i>

20:57.506 --> 20:59.800
Thank you for dealing with this.
I'll take it from here.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.218
<i>-Will you?</i>
-Yes.

21:39.506 --> 21:42.301
You think I don't know
what you were doing in Kansas City?

21:46.221 --> 21:47.431
I didn't touch him.

21:48.181 --> 21:51.935
No, but you beat the living shit
out of a fucking stranger.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.354
I'm sorry.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.274
I got mad.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.109
And he was a dick.<i> </i>

22:00.485 --> 22:02.237
You're lucky they got you out.

22:07.409 --> 22:10.078
That piece of shit
needs his ass kicked, Ruth.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.749
-I can't believe you don't want him dead.
-No, I do.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.585
I just don't want you dead and me dead,

22:16.668 --> 22:18.962
and Marty and Wendy fucking dead, too.

22:19.046 --> 22:22.215
You still care about them
after they don't lift a finger over this?

22:23.008 --> 22:24.885
They cut ties with the mob.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.303
And that's enough for you?

22:29.973 --> 22:30.932
No.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.060
It's not enough, but...

22:34.019 --> 22:36.813
But it's what I got, so shut the fuck up

22:36.897 --> 22:39.983
and promise me
that this won't happen again. All right?

22:40.859 --> 22:41.860
All right.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.197
I'm sorry.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.576
[Ben sighs]

22:54.081 --> 22:56.124
You know, Wendy wasn't always soft.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.001
[Ruth scoffs]

22:59.669 --> 23:00.629
She wasn't.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.217
As a kid, she'd...

23:05.592 --> 23:07.260
fight anyone who got near me.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.598
Took out a kid's front teeth once
for calling us poor.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.976
She should've found a way to put that
son of a bitch in a hospital that night.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.478
That night.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.773
I'm telling you, marrying Marty
made Wendy chickenshit.

23:19.856 --> 23:23.902
[scoffs] Your sister ain't chickenshit.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.321
Trust me.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.410
Oh, yeah? What have you seen her do?

23:32.661 --> 23:33.620
Plenty.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.373
Like what?

23:39.334 --> 23:41.253
It doesn't matter. Let it go.

23:43.463 --> 23:44.756
Seriously, Ruth.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.513
She's not what you think she is.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.015
All right?

23:54.599 --> 23:57.269
Your sister is not soft.

23:57.352 --> 24:01.189
She works for a fucking drug cartel.

24:02.691 --> 24:07.154
You really think she couldn't
bring herself to hurt Frank Jr.?

24:08.405 --> 24:09.823
She's done it before...

24:10.782 --> 24:12.242
when it suited her.

24:14.077 --> 24:15.120
She just...

24:15.954 --> 24:17.831
didn't feel like doing it now.

24:19.583 --> 24:23.086
And Marty?
Marty doesn't stop your sister doing shit.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.175
What are you talking about, Ruth?

24:28.717 --> 24:30.093
What did she do to you?

24:34.097 --> 24:37.726
Nothing. Just shut the fuck up
and let me drive.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.030
-Hi, you need me?
-Yeah. Um...

24:50.363 --> 24:52.365
Just hung up with Helen. She's not happy.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.620
Well, I can't say I blame her.

24:56.786 --> 25:00.415
She tells me that you're handling things.
[stammers] What does that mean?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.375
-It means I'm handling things.
-Uh-huh.

25:02.459 --> 25:05.086
Can-- Can you tell me how?
'Cause this was bad, Wendy.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.714
I don't need you to tell me that.
I told her I'll fix it, and I will.

25:07.797 --> 25:10.425
Yeah, do me a favor and just--
Just walk me through it.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.094
'Cause if you don't tell me,
uh, what you're doing,

25:13.178 --> 25:15.514
if you don't communicate with me,
then I can't help you.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.183
Yeah, I don't want your fucking help.
I told you I'm handling it.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.226
Wendy.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.019
How?

25:23.355 --> 25:25.148
When I'm finished here,
I'm gonna go to Ruth's.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.567
I'm gonna talk to him,
try and get him back on his meds.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.444
Right, see, that you've done before.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.988
-Yeah, well, I have no other choice.
-Yes, you do.

25:32.572 --> 25:33.490
We do.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.744
I think you'll admit that
had we not committed him ten years ago,

25:37.827 --> 25:38.995
he would be dead today.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.622
-We don't know that.
-Yes, we do.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.707
And he's very lucky
that Helen got him out of jail

25:42.791 --> 25:45.460
because now we can commit him
to a place that can actually help him.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.254
I am not committing my brother.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.256
It would kill him.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.883
-You said that ten years ago.
-And he hasn't been the same since.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.510
He's not going back to a place like that.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.011
He's not capable of making that decision.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.681
-And you are?
-I think so.

25:58.473 --> 26:01.851
Yeah. In fact, I made some phone calls.
There's a private facility around here.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.728
Looks like a great place,
we just need to get him there.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.231
Okay, there is no "we" here.
I am doing this alone.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.358
Boy, wouldn't it be great
if that was true?

26:08.441 --> 26:10.527
You think I like dealing with
your fucking brother, Wendy?

26:10.610 --> 26:12.279
He's been a problem
since the day you and I met.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.448
Oh, well, congratulations then,
'cause he's not your problem anymore.

26:16.992 --> 26:17.993
[door slams shut]

26:18.076 --> 26:21.663
[woman] At minimum,
we can recommend wire fraud charges,

26:21.746 --> 26:25.125
Truth in Lending Act violations,
aggravated identity theft.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.627
We might even be looking at RICO here.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.131
Can we have a moment, please?

26:48.315 --> 26:51.234
Marty Byrde's wife Wendy
has become something of an obstacle--

26:51.318 --> 26:53.069
This isn't about your forensic audit.

26:57.532 --> 27:00.869
A Missouri state senator slipped us
this evidence of criminal activity

27:00.952 --> 27:02.329
in the payday loan industry.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.129
Okay.

27:11.796 --> 27:14.007
It was obtained from an anonymous source.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.926
A source who claims they tried
to slip it to you first,

27:17.010 --> 27:18.511
but you refused to accept it.

27:18.595 --> 27:19.471
That's true.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.850
This is a viable investigation.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.313
There's good evidence here.
Why wouldn't you take the case?

27:28.396 --> 27:30.482
Because the anonymous source
is Marty Byrde.

27:30.565 --> 27:31.399
So?

27:34.235 --> 27:35.779
Honestly, I felt...

27:36.196 --> 27:38.782
if I accepted,
I'd be compromising my integrity.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.326
Your integrity?

27:46.081 --> 27:47.832
There's a crime being committed here.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.669
Your job is to investigate crime.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.504
You chose to look the other way.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.174
So much for your integrity.

28:01.888 --> 28:04.933
When the casino warrant expires,
I want you to return to DC.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.562
I'm putting you back on
forensic accounting full-time.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.940
I fought for years to get field duty.

28:12.315 --> 28:13.900
So did I, Special Agent.

28:42.804 --> 28:43.888
[Ben sighs]

28:48.685 --> 28:49.561
[Ben] Lay it on me.

28:49.644 --> 28:52.605
Tell me what a fuck-up I am,
what a fuck-up I've always been.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.400
Hey, hey, hey, don't get mad at me.

28:55.608 --> 28:57.110
I'm not mad at anybody.

28:57.777 --> 28:59.320
I just know where this is headed.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.030
Oh, do you? Where?

29:02.031 --> 29:03.199
How's it gonna end?

29:03.908 --> 29:05.493
Where does it always end, Ben?

29:09.956 --> 29:11.791
I didn't come here to give you shit.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.210
Then why did you come?

29:14.544 --> 29:17.547
To let you know it is not safe
for you to be here right now.

29:18.798 --> 29:20.967
Especially when you're acting like this.

29:22.218 --> 29:25.638
I went after Frank Jr.
because you and Marty wouldn't do shit.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.975
We did everything we could do.

29:30.685 --> 29:32.687
Ruth is safe. She knows that.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.648
Yeah, Ruth says
you could have done something

29:35.940 --> 29:37.484
and chose not to.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.903
What the fuck does that mean?

29:41.404 --> 29:42.697
What could you have done?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.244
How much, Ben?

29:51.206 --> 29:54.626
How much is it gonna cost
to get you out of town?

29:55.543 --> 29:57.629
Get you set up, get your life back?

29:57.921 --> 29:58.963
My life...

30:00.715 --> 30:02.342
My life is here now.

30:02.675 --> 30:03.927
No, it is not.

30:08.765 --> 30:09.724
Fuck you.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.978
-Fuck you.
-Ben!

30:15.688 --> 30:16.648
Ben!

30:21.319 --> 30:22.487
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.872
[shower running]

30:38.127 --> 30:39.504
[shower stops]

30:40.296 --> 30:41.422
Darlene?

30:42.298 --> 30:43.383
[Darlene] Just a sec.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.177
[sighs]

30:49.013 --> 30:51.808
You know this thing is $1,000 a plate,
right?

30:52.600 --> 30:53.977
We can afford it.

30:56.104 --> 30:59.023
Why are we even going to this thing?
I thought you hate this shit.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.694
I own a third of that monstrosity.

31:04.070 --> 31:06.573
And it's on my land.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.033
And besides...

31:12.495 --> 31:16.249
I would pay 100 grand

31:17.876 --> 31:20.837
just to see the look on Wendy Byrde's face
when we walk in there.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.255
[laughs]

31:24.257 --> 31:26.718
You're not embarrassed
to be seen there with me, are you?

31:29.679 --> 31:30.638
Never.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.061
[upbeat jazz plays]

31:44.277 --> 31:45.820
[Ruth] The main event is tonight.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.906
So, please, just enjoy yourselves,

31:47.989 --> 31:50.033
drink, eat, whatever...

31:50.116 --> 31:52.869
-[chattering, laughing]
-[Ruth] Thank you so much.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.882
Let's just see how the evening goes

32:05.965 --> 32:08.635
before we start toasting each other,
shall we?

32:13.848 --> 32:16.351
Oh, Erin looks lovely.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.145
Yours, too.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.859
-[Charlotte sighs]
-[Jonah] Why do we have to go on stage?

32:25.777 --> 32:28.571
Because it's called
the Byrde <i>Family</i> Foundation,

32:28.655 --> 32:30.031
and we're all a part of it, so...

32:35.703 --> 32:38.748
Hey. You'll be fine. Don't worry.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.938
What the fuck is she doing here?

33:06.776 --> 33:08.736
I can't help who buys tickets.

33:09.570 --> 33:10.530
[Darlene] Hey, Ruth.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.493
Y'all look so nice.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.371
-Thank you.
-So do you.

33:19.789 --> 33:20.957
Wyatt tells me...

33:21.791 --> 33:24.085
you're practically running this eyesore.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.423
-[laughs] Well--
-And that makes me happy.

33:29.382 --> 33:33.803
It's good to have some local blood
in my casino.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.062
-[Ruth] Y'all enjoy the party.
-[Wyatt] Thanks.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.480
[Darlene] Don't think we won't.

33:46.941 --> 33:49.277
[chattering]

34:12.508 --> 34:13.468
What was that?

34:13.718 --> 34:15.053
Hey. Um...

34:15.428 --> 34:19.057
it's pretty bad, actually.
We may have gone too far.

34:19.140 --> 34:23.186
They are pulling her off of our case,
and she's being sent back to DC.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.481
You've got to get her job back.
We can't lose her.

34:26.564 --> 34:27.899
Yeah, I know.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.117
[crowd applauding]

34:38.201 --> 34:41.079
[Marty]
Hello, everyone. Good evening and welcome.

34:41.162 --> 34:44.332
I'm Marty Byrde,
but some of you already know that,

34:44.415 --> 34:45.625
I see some familiar faces.

34:45.708 --> 34:48.753
But I'm willing to bet
that every single person here

34:48.836 --> 34:51.631
knows my wife Wendy Byrde.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.758
-She's truly the...
-[crowd applauding]

34:53.841 --> 34:56.385
...the driving force of... 

34:56.469 --> 34:58.805
It's thrilling to see it finally come
to fruition,

34:58.888 --> 35:00.473
and, uh, well...

35:00.973 --> 35:03.935
See, I'm already getting the, um,
"Dad, you've been talking too much" look,

35:04.018 --> 35:08.689
so I'll stop talking,
and let's say hi to Wendy Byrde.

35:13.069 --> 35:16.405
Oh, thank you all so much for...
for coming here this evening.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.826
This foundation has been a dream of mine,

35:20.201 --> 35:23.496
you know, since the early days
when I was working on a certain...

35:23.579 --> 35:25.665
Illinois senator's second campaign.

35:26.082 --> 35:28.543
A charitable foundation with no policy,

35:29.001 --> 35:31.295
no politics, with a simple mandate:

35:32.171 --> 35:34.132
to make the world a better place.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.968
-And I know, I know it sounds naive.
-[scattered chuckles]

35:38.094 --> 35:41.264
But I also-- I know
we can do some good here,

35:41.722 --> 35:43.391
right in our own front yard.

35:43.474 --> 35:46.477
We can make our communities
a better place to live.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.313
We can make it more equitable,

35:49.689 --> 35:53.568
a better place for our children,
for our families, for ourselves.

35:54.527 --> 35:57.697
And before I introduce the main event,
there...

35:59.198 --> 36:01.284
there's one person who I need to thank,

36:02.577 --> 36:05.329
and that is my husband Marty Byrde.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.169
Without whom I would not be standing here.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.796
So without further ado,

36:13.880 --> 36:16.090
to introduce our first initiative,

36:16.465 --> 36:18.551
Missouri State Senator Andrew Wade.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.887
[applause]

36:25.183 --> 36:27.101
"Make the world a better place."

36:28.394 --> 36:29.770
Sounds like a pipe dream.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.357
Sounds like something a politician says
to placate his base.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.027
Something my 93-year-old nana would call,

36:36.944 --> 36:39.697
pardon her French,
"a steaming crock of shit."

36:39.780 --> 36:41.324
[laughing]

36:41.908 --> 36:43.743
[Andrew] The other thing she'd say is,

36:44.202 --> 36:46.954
"Talk don't matter
till the rubber hits the road."

36:47.538 --> 36:49.123
So, I'd like to start driving

36:49.207 --> 36:52.460
and tell you about not one,
but two initiatives

36:52.543 --> 36:54.545
funded by the Byrde Family Foundation.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.632
The first will take on payday loan abuses.

36:58.257 --> 37:01.510
The second will target fraud
in foreclosure relief.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.137
Both particularly...

37:03.221 --> 37:04.430
We need to talk.

37:04.972 --> 37:06.474
I'm in the middle of an event.

37:06.557 --> 37:10.228
What happened to Marty's partner
in Chicago? [panting]

37:10.353 --> 37:13.856
-Okay, let's go talk downstairs.
-No. Right here, right now.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.733
Did you make that partner disappear, too,

37:15.816 --> 37:18.277
or did the real shit start
when you got here to the Ozarks? 

37:18.361 --> 37:20.196
-This is not the place--
-What, this?

37:20.279 --> 37:22.823
This is fucking fake. It's a lie.

37:22.907 --> 37:25.701
[Ben] How long before you think
everybody here realizes that?

37:25.785 --> 37:26.994
You're having an episode.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.248
-I need you just to take a deep breath.
-Do not-- do not--

37:30.331 --> 37:31.958
do not fucking do that to me.

37:32.041 --> 37:35.920
Don't you fucking condescend me,
like I'm fucking sick and you're well.

37:36.003 --> 37:38.965
Okay, okay, we can talk about all of this,

37:39.048 --> 37:40.675
but just not right now.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.135
-Let's talk about Ruth's dad.
-I need you to keep your voice down.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.930
I will not keep my fucking voice down!

37:46.013 --> 37:47.682
Hey, Ben. Ben, is everything okay?

37:47.765 --> 37:50.351
No, Marty. Nothing is fucking okay.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.812
-I need you to just calm down a little--
-[crowd gasps]

37:52.895 --> 37:55.564
[grunting]

37:56.857 --> 37:59.235
[snarls] You're a fucking liar!

37:59.944 --> 38:01.946
You're all fucking liars! 

38:02.405 --> 38:06.075
[Ben continues grunting, shouting]

38:07.618 --> 38:10.871
You're all fucking liars! Everybody!

38:10.955 --> 38:13.040
[crowd clamoring]

38:27.763 --> 38:28.931
[turns engine off]

38:31.434 --> 38:32.560
[Wendy sighs]

38:37.773 --> 38:40.735
I don't want to do this either,
but you know we have to.

38:40.818 --> 38:41.694
Do we?

38:43.779 --> 38:47.366
There's no good options, Wendy.
It's jail or hospital.

38:50.244 --> 38:52.788
It'll kill him. [sighs]

38:53.372 --> 38:54.332
So will jail.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.885
[woman] Sheriff Nix is waiting for you
in his office.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.470
[Helen sighs]

39:10.097 --> 39:11.140
[Wendy exhales]

39:11.223 --> 39:14.935
Sheriff has agreed. He'll request
a transfer to the state hospital.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.396
State hospital?

39:17.980 --> 39:21.400
-[Helen] In lieu of jail.
-Uh, can't-- can't we...

39:21.984 --> 39:24.403
Can't we just send him
to a private facility?

39:24.487 --> 39:27.198
We've already found a very good one.
It's nearby.

39:27.281 --> 39:28.949
[Nix] I'm sorry, but that's the law.

39:29.992 --> 39:33.079
Sheriff needs your permission
as next of kin. Does he have it?

39:40.169 --> 39:41.921
Good. I need to see my client.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.280
You're lucky.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.325
<i>Marty won't be pressing charges.</i>

40:13.953 --> 40:16.956
<i>And the sheriff is willing</i>
<i>to consider this a family squabble</i>

40:17.039 --> 40:20.126
<i>rather than a bail violation,</i>
<i>so you're not going to jail.</i>

40:21.836 --> 40:25.548
<i>You are going to the Central Ozarks</i>
<i>Behavioral Health Center.</i>

40:31.887 --> 40:32.721
No.

40:33.055 --> 40:33.889
[Helen] Yes.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.934
You will be committed
on an indefinite hold.

40:37.893 --> 40:38.894
No.

40:39.770 --> 40:44.483
[sobbing] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:45.901 --> 40:47.445
No, no, no.

40:48.487 --> 40:52.074
<i>No, no. No! No!</i>

40:52.783 --> 40:54.368
[Ben sobbing] <i>No!</i>

40:55.077 --> 40:56.912
<i>No!</i>

40:58.164 --> 41:00.166
<i>No!</i>

41:01.125 --> 41:03.294
<i>-Wendy!</i>
-[groans]

41:04.170 --> 41:05.754
<i>No!</i>

41:06.922 --> 41:09.425
<i>-No!</i>
-[crying]

41:10.801 --> 41:14.513
<i>-No, no!</i>
-[shudders]

41:15.222 --> 41:18.350
[sobbing continues] <i>No!</i>

41:18.434 --> 41:20.436
<i>Wendy!</i>

41:20.769 --> 41:24.982
<i>I don't wanna go! I don't wanna go there!</i>

41:55.471 --> 41:57.139
[Charlotte sighs]

42:04.980 --> 42:06.023
Is Ben okay?

42:07.650 --> 42:08.817
I guess so.

42:09.610 --> 42:11.403
Dad texted and said not to worry.

42:22.206 --> 42:23.040
Hey.

42:24.416 --> 42:26.210
Don't let all that shit
that happened tonight

42:26.293 --> 42:27.962
be what you remember, okay?

42:31.465 --> 42:32.341
What do you mean?

42:32.424 --> 42:33.842
You and Erin.

42:34.301 --> 42:35.594
Remember that.

42:38.722 --> 42:39.890
It doesn't mean much.

42:39.974 --> 42:41.308
[laughs] Yes, it does.

42:42.601 --> 42:45.312
You got kissed by a girl. Holy shit.

42:47.731 --> 42:50.109
So, remember that
when you remember tonight.

42:55.281 --> 42:57.283
-I did, didn't I?
-[laughs]

43:17.344 --> 43:18.470
[door shuts]

43:20.472 --> 43:21.599
[woman] Ruth Langmore?

43:22.975 --> 43:24.184
Uh, yeah, that's me.

43:24.351 --> 43:25.561
[woman] You can see him now.

43:25.894 --> 43:27.479
Uh, I'm his sister.

43:27.855 --> 43:29.440
He only wants to see her.

43:34.862 --> 43:37.906
Here, give him this.
It's his slippers and his robe--

43:37.990 --> 43:39.700
No robes are allowed here.

43:42.995 --> 43:45.831
It's his slippers and some Vonnegut.

43:46.206 --> 43:47.458
He likes Kurt Vonnegut.

43:49.752 --> 43:52.046
-Okay.
-Okay? And tell him that I love him.

43:52.129 --> 43:54.298
Tell him this is only temporary,
until he gets better.

44:09.980 --> 44:13.442
Any sharp objects on you?
Pen, pencil, keys, hair clips?

44:14.485 --> 44:15.694
Just my keys.

44:15.986 --> 44:18.614
You'll have to leave your keys out here.
Can I see your bag, please?

44:18.697 --> 44:19.948
Oh, yeah. [clears throat]

44:25.412 --> 44:26.246
Okay.

44:27.581 --> 44:30.626
-[buzzer sounds]
-[lock clicks]

44:34.088 --> 44:36.799
[door squeaks, clangs shut]

45:04.660 --> 45:06.495
I can't believe she did this.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.331
Her and that fucking lawyer.

45:16.338 --> 45:18.215
What happened last night?

45:19.591 --> 45:21.844
Why did you come in the party like that?

45:24.847 --> 45:26.181
I figured it out.

45:28.976 --> 45:30.936
She killed your dad, didn't she?

45:32.771 --> 45:35.107
And that FBI agent. She did that, too?

45:40.904 --> 45:42.656
[shudders]

45:43.198 --> 45:45.826
Not-- Not, um, Petty, just...

45:47.703 --> 45:48.746
I'm sorry.

45:51.373 --> 45:54.042
[stammers] Um...

45:55.085 --> 45:57.004
it's complicated. He was...

46:03.594 --> 46:07.306
-I should have never said anything.
-[Ben sniffling]

46:11.393 --> 46:14.813
She promised me
she would never do this again.

46:24.990 --> 46:28.202
This place is death, Ruth. It'll kill me.

46:28.660 --> 46:30.245
She knows I can't take it.

46:31.497 --> 46:34.500
Tell me what I did that's so insane
I need to be locked up.

46:35.375 --> 46:37.419
What exactly am I wrong about?

46:41.048 --> 46:42.174
Nothing.

46:43.133 --> 46:46.303
[sniffling]
It's-- It's not fair. None of it.

46:47.012 --> 46:49.515
What happened to you, that's not okay.

46:51.975 --> 46:54.353
[continues sobbing]

46:54.478 --> 46:55.562
I know.

47:02.236 --> 47:04.655
[blubbering] Fuck.

47:12.079 --> 47:13.622
I'm sorry.

47:14.289 --> 47:16.667
It's fucking drugs...

47:25.676 --> 47:26.802
What can I do?

47:34.017 --> 47:35.060
[sniffles]

47:38.480 --> 47:39.857
Get me out of here.

47:41.900 --> 47:44.486
I can't stand it in this fucking place.

47:46.780 --> 47:48.490
You gotta get me out of here.

47:51.869 --> 47:52.786
Please.

47:56.290 --> 47:57.374
Please.

47:59.126 --> 48:02.421
[buzzer sounds]

48:04.756 --> 48:06.425
[door locks]

48:36.371 --> 48:38.832
I'm having misgivings
about our partners up here.

48:39.416 --> 48:40.417
[Navarro] <i>Explain.</i>

48:42.002 --> 48:44.755
They're struggling to move
even a minimum of cash.

48:45.172 --> 48:48.508
Their efforts with the special agent are
at a standstill.

48:49.092 --> 48:52.638
And to top it off, last night's
charity event did not go well.

48:55.891 --> 48:57.851
<i>And why is this any concern of mine?</i>

49:01.188 --> 49:03.857
Maybe they are just
not what we thought they were.

49:04.483 --> 49:06.068
<i>Do whatever you need to do.</i>

49:19.915 --> 49:23.210
[sighs] Oh, hi.

49:23.335 --> 49:24.336
[Ruth] Hey.

49:25.003 --> 49:26.004
How, uh...

49:27.339 --> 49:28.840
How-- How's he doing?

49:30.676 --> 49:31.760
[Ruth] Not good.

49:33.053 --> 49:35.555
-[Wyatt groans]
-Sheriff's got him, like,

49:35.639 --> 49:37.808
on suicide watch or something.

49:39.601 --> 49:40.936
He's in this place, Wyatt.

49:41.019 --> 49:44.231
This... This awful place.

49:45.440 --> 49:50.153
I mean, they call it
a "behavioral health facility,"

49:50.237 --> 49:54.074
but it's nothing but a shithole
for crazy people.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.744
I can't believe they put him there.

49:58.036 --> 50:00.455
He doesn't belong
in a fucking place like that.

50:03.041 --> 50:03.875
I...

50:05.794 --> 50:07.754
I gotta get him the fuck out of there.

50:12.592 --> 50:14.761
Hey, I think maybe Darlene could help.

50:20.642 --> 50:22.185
Don't you play games with me.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.354
You put him in there,
you can get him out.

50:24.438 --> 50:27.399
I'm not playing games, Darlene.
I'm just trying to uphold the law.

50:27.899 --> 50:31.361
And what if I let that guy out,
he goes and shoots up a fucking bar?

50:31.445 --> 50:33.989
He won't. I want him out today.

50:34.823 --> 50:36.742
You know that judge
who committed him, right?

50:36.825 --> 50:38.368
Who signed the order?

50:39.244 --> 50:42.039
I want you to drive out
to his place right now

50:42.122 --> 50:43.999
and convince him
to tear up that order.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.710
And how am I supposed to do that?

50:46.793 --> 50:48.253
Tell him you were wrong.

50:48.336 --> 50:51.798
Tell him you didn't have all the evidence.

50:51.882 --> 50:54.468
I don't give a holy fucking shit
what you tell him.

50:54.551 --> 50:56.094
Just get it done.

51:00.348 --> 51:01.308
All right.

51:03.602 --> 51:04.853
If I do this for you,

51:05.604 --> 51:07.147
you gotta do something for me.

51:07.230 --> 51:08.648
Oh, you're making demands now?

51:08.732 --> 51:10.692
No, no. Just asking.

51:11.610 --> 51:12.861
If I do this for you,

51:13.779 --> 51:16.239
you need to find somebody else
to run your product.

51:21.495 --> 51:22.329
Deal.

51:25.540 --> 51:26.583
[door shuts]

51:44.559 --> 51:45.769
[Marty] <i>Discharged?</i>

51:46.103 --> 51:48.605
Uh, who the hell discharged him?

51:48.688 --> 51:52.067
[Wendy] <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe Darlene pulled some strings.</i>

51:52.776 --> 51:57.155
Why the hell would<i> </i>Darlene get involved
with this?

51:57.239 --> 51:58.949
Well, because she hates us.

51:59.449 --> 52:01.451
Because she's fucking Wyatt.

52:01.868 --> 52:03.328
Because Wyatt's Ruth's cousin.

52:04.454 --> 52:05.831
[Marty]
<i>Any idea where he's headed?</i>

52:05.914 --> 52:07.707
[Wendy] <i>No. He got in a cab.</i>

52:07.874 --> 52:09.417
<i>Ruth's maybe or...</i>

52:10.585 --> 52:12.003
<i>Or he's coming here.</i>

52:12.754 --> 52:14.339
[Marty] <i>I'll head to Ruth's. I'm closer.</i>

52:27.644 --> 52:29.020
-Yes, what was it?
-[both laughing]

52:29.104 --> 52:32.023
-"I am I own entity."
-"...own entity."

52:32.107 --> 52:33.859
[laughing]
Can you believe you ever said that?

52:33.942 --> 52:35.443
-Okay, now that--
-[Ben] There you are.

52:35.527 --> 52:36.403
[laughing]

52:36.486 --> 52:38.113
-[Ben] Hey!
-Yeah.

52:39.739 --> 52:41.616
Don't bother. It's the sheriff got me out.

52:41.700 --> 52:42.534
-Get behind me.
-Mom?

52:42.617 --> 52:44.995
You wanna know what a piece of shit
your mother is, Erin?

52:45.120 --> 52:47.998
That she's a fucking lawyer?
Well, she ain't!

52:48.081 --> 52:50.083
-[Erin gasping]
-She's a fucking monster.

52:50.208 --> 52:53.962
My sister is a monster.
Her husband is a monster, too.

52:54.045 --> 52:57.549
You know what they really do,
who they really work for, Erin?

52:57.632 --> 53:00.343
They launder drug money.

53:00.594 --> 53:04.306
Drug money, Erin,
for the Navarro drug cartel!

53:04.389 --> 53:06.474
That's enough.
You need to turn around and leave now.

53:06.558 --> 53:07.976
Fuck you.

53:08.059 --> 53:09.811
Fuck! [groans]
What the fuck was I thinking?

53:09.895 --> 53:11.396
-Mom, is that true?
-No, of course it isn't.

53:11.479 --> 53:12.814
[Ben] What the fuck was I thinking?

53:13.231 --> 53:15.609
[stammering] You're not--

53:15.901 --> 53:19.613
You're not my fucking lawyer.
You're not my fucking lawyer.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.615
You're not even a fucking lawyer.

53:21.698 --> 53:24.159
You're a fucking cartel operative!

53:24.409 --> 53:25.785
You sell heroin.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.580
You have people killed.
You have them tortured.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.415
You tortured Ruth!

53:30.790 --> 53:33.460
[exhales] Did you kill her dad?
Or did you just order the hit?

53:33.585 --> 53:35.128
-Mom...
-Your mom!

53:35.212 --> 53:40.091
Your mom has people killed and tortured
for the cartel!

53:40.592 --> 53:42.636
You wanna know what's really fucked up?

53:42.969 --> 53:45.013
Do you remember that truck
that got all shot up?

53:45.096 --> 53:47.182
They're in the middle
of a fucking drug war!

53:47.265 --> 53:48.892
That could have been
your fucking house!

53:48.975 --> 53:51.561
-[sobbing]
-Enough! Get out!

53:52.896 --> 53:54.814
[panting]

54:01.863 --> 54:03.573
[sighs] You okay, baby?

54:03.657 --> 54:07.827
-[panting] Mom, why was he saying this?
-It's okay.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.079
Because he's sick.

54:09.955 --> 54:11.665
He's supposed to be
in a mental institution,

54:11.748 --> 54:13.500
and he doesn't know what he's saying.
It's okay.

54:13.583 --> 54:16.378
[Erin continues panting]

54:23.260 --> 54:25.178
Shh.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.264
