<i>Water our furrows!</i>

00:46.160 --> 00:46.920
At ease!

00:48.120 --> 00:49.240
Attention.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.400
Going home this weekend?

00:53.480 --> 00:55.200
I ain't staying in this dump.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.160
Morville!

01:43.840 --> 01:45.920
Niggas? You bastard!

01:48.240 --> 01:49.800
Sonofabitch!

01:51.720 --> 01:53.400
You sonofabitch!

03:43.200 --> 03:44.480
Hey, Yazid.

03:44.560 --> 03:45.400
What you doin'?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.240
Stop!

03:47.320 --> 03:49.200
You're getting it everywhere!

03:50.840 --> 03:53.400
"Motherfucker" isn't an insult.
It's empowering!

03:53.480 --> 03:55.800
-See me on stage?
-They insulted us.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.280
No they didn't! It's to wind up the crowd.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.760
Get everyone jumping.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.640
-They act like stars.
-They are!

04:01.720 --> 04:04.680
-In the US, not in Paris!
-Chill, girls!

04:04.760 --> 04:06.360
You still rappin'?

04:06.440 --> 04:08.960
-Still bursting into song?
-What d'ya think?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.200
I think French rap blows.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.000
Even you said rap isn't French,
it's a Yank thing.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.280
I never said that.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.480
Listen, Didier. Hey!

04:23.120 --> 04:25.200
I'm on my way up!

04:25.279 --> 04:27.400
Listen. We're on the move.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.960
If you get it, great.
If you don't, tough shit.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.000
Tough shit for me then!

04:33.080 --> 04:35.000
What are you workin' on, Solo?

04:35.080 --> 04:37.800
Recording, ripping rhymes…

04:37.880 --> 04:39.720
-We even got our name!
-Yeah?

04:39.800 --> 04:41.320
-Assassin.
-What's the track?

04:41.400 --> 04:42.920
<i>Feeble Minds.</i>

04:43.000 --> 04:44.400
Autobiographical, is it?

04:44.480 --> 04:46.640
<i>My head's a hurricane</i>
<i>Ideas racin'</i>

04:46.720 --> 04:49.120
<i>Life's a bowling lane</i>
<i>And I'm a pin</i>

04:49.200 --> 04:51.400
<i>Pin of iron, glass or stone</i>

04:51.480 --> 04:53.560
<i>Guided by the best radar known</i>

04:53.640 --> 04:55.480
<i>To mankind: The mind!</i>

04:55.560 --> 04:58.800
<i>I analyze life and its twists</i>
<i>Get my drift?</i>

04:58.880 --> 05:01.480
<i>My dexterous flows</i>
<i>And my righteous bros</i>

05:01.560 --> 05:04.960
<i>Give my words a divine aura</i>
<i>That gets you in a trance</i>

05:05.040 --> 05:05.960
<i>So dance!</i>

05:06.040 --> 05:07.760
<i>The beat is rising</i>
<i>Groove inspiring</i>

05:07.840 --> 05:09.720
<i>Like a bomb from the sky</i>

05:09.800 --> 05:13.000
<i>Every word gonna fly</i>
<i>Like a tiny rainbow</i>

05:13.080 --> 05:15.600
<i>Shiny and wet</i>
<i>In the bead of sweat</i>

05:15.680 --> 05:17.640
<i>Runnin' down your face</i>
<i>Buzzin' in my brain…</i>

05:17.720 --> 05:19.640
Hey, guys!

05:19.720 --> 05:21.320
Your backup singers!

05:24.080 --> 05:25.920
Come here, guys!

05:29.320 --> 05:31.520
-We need your costumes!
-C'mon!

05:33.160 --> 05:35.320
Hey, that's your size!

05:37.280 --> 05:38.920
C'mon, let's get 'em!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.200
C'mon!

05:57.080 --> 05:59.040
Isn't that that asshole Morville?

05:59.120 --> 06:00.160
Hang on.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.640
What's your problem, fucker?

06:04.720 --> 06:06.960
Off to Mexico with your she-ape, Pepito?

06:07.040 --> 06:11.200
-Move it or you'll miss your train!
-Shut your face!

06:11.280 --> 06:13.280
Fuck!

06:13.360 --> 06:14.800
Am I your she-ape?

06:14.880 --> 06:17.560
Those Nazis gonna land me in it again!

06:17.640 --> 06:18.360
Chill.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.920
Take what you can, then get the hell out.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.720
Easy for you to say.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.440
I wanna punch their lights out
whenever I see them.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.040
You're so fucking lucky
they declared you unfit.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.680
The bank's not much fun either.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.280
They're such fucking bastards.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.360
OK, here goes.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.600
Didier!

06:49.600 --> 06:50.560
Didier!

06:53.200 --> 06:54.560
You OK?

07:00.160 --> 07:03.800
I can't even fucking break anything!

07:12.640 --> 07:14.080
<i>Hasta la vista</i>!

07:15.560 --> 07:18.400
Go easy, OK? We got stuff to do.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.760
Get back to your bank, teller lady!

07:28.800 --> 07:30.000
Here. This is today's.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.240
We never see you arrive!

07:41.520 --> 07:42.760
You've made an effort!

07:42.840 --> 07:45.120
We're in the back office.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.840
You don't have to.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.600
-Are you in the union, Bruno?
-No.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.160
Join, if you plan to stay.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.160
Because believe me…

07:57.240 --> 07:59.160
they'll come down on you.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.440
He's the union rep.
He never misses a rally.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.040
Power to the workers!

08:05.200 --> 08:08.760
Make your own choice.
That's not why I came.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.480
This is the list of stock transactions.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.720
Find all the errors in the orders.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.200
Doing handiwork, Bruno?

08:19.280 --> 08:21.400
For example, look… here.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.920
The trader mixed up the order. See?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.960
He placed a buy order
when he meant a sell order.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.800
If you spot them all,
it'll be a real help. Got it?

08:30.880 --> 08:34.880
As soon as you finish,
hurry to the trading room.

08:34.960 --> 08:35.760
Get to it.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.960
He's good, huh?

09:22.440 --> 09:23.360
Yeah.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.560
He'll fill your club.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.160
That's up to the public.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.280
A coke, please.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.800
Do you see what's going down here?

11:12.880 --> 11:16.240
Cool or what?
He's bringin' down the house!

11:16.320 --> 11:18.440
He turned the night around!

11:18.520 --> 11:20.280
He better not get cocky.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.120
He won't. Everyone's going wild.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.880
Wall-to-wall people!

11:23.960 --> 11:26.040
-See what's happening?
-Yeah…

11:26.120 --> 11:28.600
What more do you want? Be happy!

11:28.680 --> 11:30.760
He plays hip-hop. It's good but…

11:30.840 --> 11:32.600
he should play other stuff too.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.640
The hipsters didn't come for him.

11:34.720 --> 11:35.800
Radio Nova draws them.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.480
He got them dancing, so get off my tits!

11:38.560 --> 11:41.160
Half these people didn't pay.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.640
Huh? What?

11:42.720 --> 11:44.680
Half got in free!

11:44.760 --> 11:46.800
How do they get in free?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.520
Sylvie, the girl on the door.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.520
What about her?

11:49.600 --> 11:51.960
Nice kid, but a real butterfingers.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.360
Has a little drug problem.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.120
Let me work the door. Hire me.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.120
These club nights are tough.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.000
I been running my dad's store
since I was 14!

12:04.080 --> 12:05.880
I can handle jerks, no sweat.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.760
I was born for it. Hire me.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.600
Try me out!

12:19.360 --> 12:20.320
Careful!

12:22.320 --> 12:23.160
Go on!

12:23.240 --> 12:24.360
Give me your hand.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.760
Here, look.

12:42.640 --> 12:43.480
Well?

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
It's killer!

12:45.280 --> 12:46.200
You like it?

12:46.280 --> 12:47.680
Do it on your own?

12:47.760 --> 12:49.160
Yeah.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.480
Impressive.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.480
My little tagger girl!

13:06.520 --> 13:08.400
-What's this?
-Huh?

13:09.440 --> 13:11.680
-You wear shirts now?
-Just got off work.

13:11.760 --> 13:14.320
Didn't have time to go home.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.560
You had me fooled.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.560
Your tags, windmills and stuff
were just to get me.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.440
Yeah.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.080
I'm a businessman now.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.560
This is the real you.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.480
Shame.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.440
Think I enjoy it?

13:34.600 --> 13:37.960
Sitting at a desk all day,
staring at numbers?

13:38.040 --> 13:39.360
Bores me shitless.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.440
-Do something else.
-Like what?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.600
I gotta pay my folks a grand a month

13:43.680 --> 13:45.240
-or I'm out.
-How do you do it?

13:45.920 --> 13:48.400
I could never hide behind a desk.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.880
I could never do an old person's job.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.520
I mean, I wanna do things I love.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.520
I wanna travel, do cool stuff.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.080
Where you wanna go?

13:59.720 --> 14:00.920
New York.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.680
So let's go.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.280
-Yeah.
-Hang on!

14:10.280 --> 14:13.840
I can hear it! Shh! Yep! Train's coming.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.480
We'll take it. Pack your bags, miss.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.440
No, but for real!

14:18.520 --> 14:20.200
For real! We're off to New York.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.680
OK. When?

14:21.760 --> 14:23.120
This summer, if you like.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.000
I'll work my ass off.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.920
Set money aside for tickets.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.680
Once we're there,
we can crash at Bando's place.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.800
-OK!
-Yeah?

14:30.880 --> 14:34.840
Yeah. Awesome, too cool. I'm in!

14:34.920 --> 14:37.040
-You weren't expecting that.
-No!

14:37.120 --> 14:38.520
Oh shit, I can't!

14:38.600 --> 14:39.480
What?

14:39.560 --> 14:41.400
Fuck, I'm so sorry.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.280
I can't wear these shirts for four months.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.440
I can't hide behind a desk.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.600
Hide!

14:51.680 --> 14:54.600
-Or do some old fart's job.
-Shut up!

14:58.960 --> 15:01.080
I'm selling it to them as hash.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.640
They got shit for brains!

15:02.720 --> 15:05.840
Too many pushups in the rain!

15:05.920 --> 15:08.440
The raindrops knock 'em silly!

15:08.520 --> 15:11.720
But we got a little crazy a while back.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.920
We got this jar of maggots.
You know those old jars?

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
<i>Dude swallowed one spoonful, two, three!</i>

15:18.080 --> 15:21.200
<i>They were hanging outta his mouth!</i>

15:21.280 --> 15:22.280
<i>It was disgusting.</i>

15:22.360 --> 15:25.800
They'll do anything
for a tiny lump of hash!

15:25.880 --> 15:28.800
What? Can't you see I'm talking?

15:30.080 --> 15:30.960
Anyway…

15:31.040 --> 15:33.080
Hang on, listen.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.600
I hung out with a graffiti crew
from St. Denis.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.280
-93MC, you know?
<i>-Oh yeah?</i>

15:37.360 --> 15:38.480
Chérif's bro's crew.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.840
-Right…
<i>-There's this kid KEA.</i>

15:41.920 --> 15:44.640
He's got the rage! I painted with him.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.160
<i>They're young and amped up.</i>
<i>The new generation.</i>

15:47.920 --> 15:49.840
<i>-What?</i>
-Nothing…

15:49.920 --> 15:52.320
Ok, I'll let you get back to your maggots.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.200
Yeah.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.320
Bye, bro.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.320
<i>Sergeant asks me,</i>

16:02.400 --> 16:05.680
"What's it like back home?"
And I go, "I was born here."

16:05.760 --> 16:08.960
Then he goes,
"I mean in your home country!"

16:09.040 --> 16:11.160
That fuckin' racist!

16:11.240 --> 16:13.760
I was shocked, I wanted to tear into him!

16:14.560 --> 16:15.680
I kept my cool.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.160
Don't hog the phone!

16:17.240 --> 16:19.400
-I kept my cool…
-What's going on?

16:19.480 --> 16:21.480
-Hang up!
-It's my mom, she's sick!

16:22.760 --> 16:24.960
-And she says fuck you!
-Seriously?

16:25.040 --> 16:28.920
I'm dying to go the States, man.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Vivi wants me to go with her.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.520
<i>Quit bragging, dude.</i>

16:32.600 --> 16:35.360
New York this, New York that…

16:35.440 --> 16:38.240
I see you, four-eyes!
Sittin' there with your calculator.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.320
<i>Sippin' coffee,</i>
<i>punchin' numbers you don't understand…</i>

16:43.840 --> 16:46.920
Just messin' with you. I'm stuck in here.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.040
With a buncha zombies.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.720
Sucks so hard.
Wish I could switch with you.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.720
You wouldn't last a minute, forget it!

16:54.800 --> 16:56.480
I got somethin' for you to hear.

16:56.560 --> 17:00.880
OK? I'll shut that Solo up. Check me out.

17:00.960 --> 17:06.520
<i>One, two. One, two, one, one, one, OK</i>
<i>I go first cos my name's Joey</i>

17:06.600 --> 17:09.920
<i>My words are clever, mate</i>
<i>My style and thoughts elevate</i>

17:10.000 --> 17:11.560
<i>So listen to my flow</i>

17:11.640 --> 17:14.680
<i>My flow, my flow is unique</i>

17:14.760 --> 17:17.440
<i>Check my technique</i>
<i>I make yo mama a triptych!</i>

17:17.520 --> 17:19.839
<i>OK, over to Kool Shen</i>
<i>Divin' in on the beat</i>

17:19.920 --> 17:22.560
<i>Watch me snort my flow</i>
<i>Better than a line of blow</i>

17:22.640 --> 17:25.359
<i>Make your mind go hazy</i>
<i>Your heart go crazy</i>

17:25.440 --> 17:26.680
OK, OK!

17:26.760 --> 17:29.640
<i>Your heart go crazy…</i>
<i>On the…</i>

17:29.720 --> 17:32.040
-You're not alone, pal.
-Fuck off.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.680
Did you hear me?

17:33.760 --> 17:35.160
Get off!

17:35.240 --> 17:36.560
What's wrong, Aunt Jemima?

17:36.640 --> 17:37.680
What you gonna do?

17:39.400 --> 17:42.720
Shut your filthy mouth!

17:42.800 --> 17:46.840
Want me to fuck you up?
Shut your fucking mouth!

17:50.000 --> 17:51.080
Fuck…

17:51.160 --> 17:52.920
What now?

17:53.000 --> 17:57.560
Come with me, Morville.
A stint in the slammer will calm you down.

17:57.640 --> 18:02.520
<i>My phrases will aggress you</i>
<i>Pick you up, press you…</i>

18:03.640 --> 18:05.040
Bruno?

18:05.120 --> 18:06.560
Doing overtime?

18:07.400 --> 18:10.480
No, waiting for Mireille.
She said she wants to see me.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.240
The boss wants to see you?

18:12.320 --> 18:14.280
If there's a problem, tell us.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.400
OK, Bruno? We're here for you.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.160
And if you do overtime…

18:20.160 --> 18:21.320
don't be pushed around!

18:27.760 --> 18:30.000
<i>My phrases will aggress you</i>
<i>Pick you up, press you</i>

18:30.080 --> 18:32.480
<i>Pick you up, press you</i>
<i>Wring the stress outta you</i>

18:32.560 --> 18:35.000
<i>It's never too late</i>
<i>To elevate the debate…</i>

18:37.800 --> 18:39.560
Ta-da!

18:41.760 --> 18:45.000
This is for you. Open it.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.080
Go on.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.080
They picked you for in-house training.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.680
-In the trading room.
-What?

18:57.760 --> 19:00.560
-I didn't apply.
-I know, I did it for you.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.880
I didn't mention it
because you never know.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.560
In case you were passed over
for a protégé.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.320
I hate to raise people's hopes.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.760
Two of you were selected.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.560
Out of the entire bank.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.040
Thank you.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.480
I've been in banking for 20 years.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.200
Talented young men like you?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.720
I haven't seen many.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.560
You have a sharp mind.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.120
You can be a trader, Bruno.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.120
Think about it.

19:29.200 --> 19:35.160
Traders with pinstripe suits, mustaches
and suspenders are passé.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.920
The world of finance is changing.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.640
The new traders
aren't from the old boys' network.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.600
They're like you. They break the rules!

19:45.560 --> 19:48.040
You have a future in banking, trust me.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.880
I'm betting on you.
Don't let me down, Bruno.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.560
Hey, guys.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.480
Welcome to Globo.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.120
Have fun!

20:02.160 --> 20:04.120
-Hey, welcome to Globo.
-Hi.

20:05.040 --> 20:05.760
Here.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.040
-How many?
-Five.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.280
40 each, non-negotiable.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.200
C'mon, 60 covers us!

20:12.280 --> 20:14.040
No. Five times forty is 200.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.200
We're regulars.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.720
I don't give a shit. Don't like it?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.560
Drag your ass down to the Rex!

20:19.640 --> 20:21.520
Are you crazy?

20:21.600 --> 20:23.240
-Who the hell are you?
-And you?

20:23.320 --> 20:25.800
-Know who we are?
-No, who?

20:25.880 --> 20:27.040
The Goldilocks gang?

20:27.120 --> 20:30.880
Stop. Ever heard of <i>Actuel</i> magazine?

20:30.960 --> 20:32.680
We're five <i>Actuel</i> journalists.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.440
Now there's a scoop!

20:34.520 --> 20:36.840
Look. I don't give a flying fuck!

20:36.920 --> 20:39.000
Pay up or get lost.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.440
Maurice, tell them.

20:43.880 --> 20:47.000
See? You're loaded, you shifty bastard.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.200
Have fun.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.240
Hey.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.720
Welcome to Globo.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.480
Hey, Daniel!

21:19.360 --> 21:20.320
How's things?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.480
Great!

21:22.080 --> 21:25.720
La Chapelle was killer!
I went most Saturdays.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.120
-I love what you do.
-Thanks, that's nice.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.440
I got a gift for you.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.400
How's Béatrice?

21:34.480 --> 21:36.160
She's fine. Why?

21:36.240 --> 21:38.120
She works real hard!

21:38.200 --> 21:40.880
We'll let you keep spinning.
Rip it up, dude!

21:43.160 --> 21:46.880
Dee Nasty! Dee Nasty!

21:57.080 --> 21:58.840
-Listen up!
-Put the music back on!

21:59.440 --> 22:01.280
The music's coming back!

22:01.360 --> 22:04.200
Please! Tonight is special.

22:04.280 --> 22:08.160
We've got female hip-hop artists.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.760
It takes real guts to perform,

22:10.840 --> 22:13.360
so please give it up…

22:13.440 --> 22:16.640
for the girls joining me on stage:
Ladies Night!

22:20.120 --> 22:24.960
Get off! Fucking whores!
Sluts! Suck my dick!

22:25.040 --> 22:28.120
You got the wrong place!
Beauty parlor's next door!

22:28.200 --> 22:30.160
Shut your mouth, you!

22:32.040 --> 22:34.320
Go home! You suck!

22:34.400 --> 22:36.320
Go home!

22:37.880 --> 22:40.720
Get lost! Off the stage!

22:40.800 --> 22:43.640
<i>I got the Ladies beat</i>
<i>I keep it real, keep it sweet</i>

22:43.720 --> 22:45.560
<i>Straight up, we tell it like it is</i>

22:45.640 --> 22:47.960
<i>Prestige, work, all that biz</i>

22:48.040 --> 22:50.400
<i>Pop muzak</i>
<i>That shit is wack</i>

22:50.480 --> 22:52.320
<i>My ears can't take</i>
<i>The noise attack</i>

22:52.400 --> 22:54.640
<i>Dat makes 'em shake</i>
<i>Dem boring boyz</i>

22:54.720 --> 22:56.840
<i>Yo, forget that!</i>
<i>Rap's where it's at</i>

22:56.920 --> 22:58.880
<i>You get it, you adapt</i>
<i>Don't be inapt!</i>

22:58.960 --> 23:01.440
<i>Find the tempo</i>
<i>Then make the words flow</i>

23:01.520 --> 23:03.720
<i>I got the Ladies beat, hey!</i>

23:03.800 --> 23:06.160

23:16.240 --> 23:17.680
<i>I danced before I talked…</i>

23:17.760 --> 23:19.040
Shut your face!

23:19.120 --> 23:23.480
You're just jealous to see girls rapping!
Breaks your balls.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.160
You call that rap?

23:25.240 --> 23:27.560
Wanna see real rap? Come see us.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.880
Then you can talk.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.720
<i>And that ain't all</i>
<i>I got the Ladies beat</i>

23:31.800 --> 23:33.160
<i>I got the Ladies beat</i>

23:33.240 --> 23:35.400
They rock, girl! We gotta do it!

23:35.480 --> 23:37.800
-No shit!
-They're off the hook!

23:57.560 --> 24:00.880
-It's packed tonight.
-So much pussy.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.280
See the girl workin' the door?

24:08.360 --> 24:09.800
She's Dee Nasty's squeeze.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.680
Dee Nasty's
not the only one squeezin' her.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.240
Yeah?

24:14.320 --> 24:16.240
She rings up the cash.

24:16.320 --> 24:19.400
-And she makes the money shots too!
-Sicko.

24:19.480 --> 24:23.320
His girl's a ho.
Remember the VHS Djaid showed us?

24:23.400 --> 24:25.920
-The porn flick?
-Yeah, Shanghai something.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.800
There was an Asian chick in it.

24:28.880 --> 24:29.720
Yeah.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.640
-No way! That was her?!
-Yeah!

24:32.720 --> 24:36.640
What'd she say again?
"Oh yeah! Stick it in me!"

24:36.720 --> 24:40.960
"Harder, Chino, harder!"

24:44.520 --> 24:46.080
SHANGHAI SLAVE BABES

25:00.320 --> 25:02.840
-Is this all?
-Check the display stand.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.400
You're a big fan.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.400
Are there any more?

25:16.360 --> 25:17.760
No, you got 'em all.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.000
2,100 francs.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.560
Fuck.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.160
Hey, anyone there?!

26:12.280 --> 26:15.120
Lemme out, I need to fucking piss!

26:17.640 --> 26:20.040
I've been in here two hours!

26:20.120 --> 26:21.360
Fuck!

26:24.480 --> 26:26.360
I'm bursting!

26:26.440 --> 26:27.920
Cut it out!

26:28.680 --> 26:30.440
Why don't you piss on yourself?

26:30.520 --> 26:33.440
Yeah, why don't I? You know what?

26:33.520 --> 26:36.400
I'll show you, smartass.

26:37.640 --> 26:40.120
Just watch me…

26:46.400 --> 26:47.720
You're out of your mind!

26:47.800 --> 26:48.960
Wanna hold it for me?

26:49.040 --> 26:50.400
It'll reek of piss!

26:50.480 --> 26:53.440
We'll get another week with your bullshit.

26:58.680 --> 27:02.080
Chill out, girls.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.080
Look.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.560
Just relax. I'll sort it out.

27:08.720 --> 27:11.040
You're spreading your filth around!

27:11.120 --> 27:12.440
Keep your big mouth shut!

27:12.520 --> 27:14.200
I'm sick of your crap.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.360
I bet there's something in here.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.600
Yeah.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.720
That's more like it.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.400
Just what we needed.

27:43.880 --> 27:44.960
There we go!

27:46.720 --> 27:48.880
Didier, you're a genius.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.320
This'll soak it up.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.000
That shut you up quick.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.160
You're cleaning your piss
with the French flag!

28:00.040 --> 28:01.760
Or you a moron or what?

28:01.840 --> 28:04.320
You're desecrating the French flag!

28:06.120 --> 28:08.600
They'll lock you up for that, buddy.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.600
For good.

28:09.680 --> 28:13.480
-You're finished!
-Shut your face!

28:13.560 --> 28:15.120
-Dipshit!
-Morville!

28:18.320 --> 28:20.480
You've got a call.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.040
What's this mess?

28:24.120 --> 28:27.360
A leak, been dripping for ages.
It's unbearable, sir.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.560
You'll repair it after your call.

28:30.640 --> 28:31.600
Sure.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.320
Come on out.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.680
You can take the call
since it's your father.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.800
My what?

28:38.760 --> 28:40.800
There's been a death in your family.

28:45.480 --> 28:46.400
Hello?

28:46.480 --> 28:48.400
What a hassle. In the clink again?

28:48.480 --> 28:52.000
Hey, Dad.
Yeah, I screwed up bad this time.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.560
Forget it, I can't.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.040
-I'll wait for you.
<i>-I can't come home yet.</i>

28:56.120 --> 28:59.280
-I'm in the hole.
<i>-But Assassin's playing.</i>

28:59.360 --> 29:03.320
-I'll come get you.
<i>-I'm gonna miss the Assassin show!</i>

29:03.400 --> 29:07.080
Fuck, I… I keep fucking up.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.480
And I just did a real dumb thing.
They're gonna kill me.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.720
Live your life, work at the bank,

29:12.800 --> 29:14.520
<i>make money in this shit country!</i>

29:14.600 --> 29:16.480
I don't give a fuck about the bank.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.400
-Don't talk shit.
<i>-Even if I get out,</i>

29:18.480 --> 29:19.880
they'll keep me here!

29:19.960 --> 29:22.600
It's best if you forget me.

29:23.240 --> 29:24.360
Fuck.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.520
Can I go piss now?

29:33.880 --> 29:36.880
<i>Hundreds of thousands of young people</i>

29:36.960 --> 29:39.080
<i>flooded the streets of Paris today</i>

29:39.160 --> 29:41.440
<i>to protest the Devaquet bill.</i>

29:41.520 --> 29:44.880
<i>After high school and college students</i>
<i>protested for days,</i>

29:44.960 --> 29:49.160
<i>the minister reiterated his position,</i>
<i>easing people's minds.</i>

29:49.240 --> 29:51.880
He eased people's minds? Bullshit!

29:53.400 --> 29:55.040
Why are they protesting?

29:55.120 --> 29:57.520
The damn government
wants to let universities

29:57.600 --> 29:58.600
be more selective.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.080
They want to raise tuition fees.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.320
Then they go on about education for all!

30:04.400 --> 30:06.560
Assholes! Such hypocrites.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.880
What about kids who can't afford the fees?

30:09.960 --> 30:11.640
They get grants.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.480
You're pretty mad
for someone who never went to college.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.160
You bet I went to college!

30:16.240 --> 30:17.520
I went to college.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.200
To install drop ceilings.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.720
Bruno, how's work going?

30:24.800 --> 30:26.760
Fine.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.440
I don't plan to stay though.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.600
What do you mean?

30:35.200 --> 30:36.320
Hang on.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.000
Don't tell me you're quitting.

30:40.320 --> 30:42.600
Chris, he's giving up again!

30:42.680 --> 30:45.640
Your little banker's dead. Amen.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.640
-What's wrong, Bruno?
-Nothing, I'm just sick of it.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.000
It's the ideal job for you.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.800
You're bright, you'll move up.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.040
It isn't ideal.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.160
Going to a bank every day isn't my thing.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.000
It's a job, Bruno, not a thing.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.480
You can't go through life quitting things.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.400
-What's your plan?
-I dunno. I'll see.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.920
-You have no idea?
-I'll see!

31:06.000 --> 31:07.240
You have no idea?

31:09.240 --> 31:11.160
I'm warning you.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.800
Nobody shirks in this house.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.720
You live here,

31:14.800 --> 31:17.960
you eat from our fridge,
you pay your share.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.080
The construction site is hiring.

31:20.160 --> 31:23.720
I won't have you sleeping late
with your girlfriend every day.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.080
This isn't a hotel for hippies.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.040
Morville, are you jerking off?

31:35.120 --> 31:37.160
Sorry sir, got the runs!

31:46.160 --> 31:48.200
You wanna rot in here or help me?

31:48.280 --> 31:49.840
We're all in the same shit.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.760
If I go down, we all go down.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.080
Guess we don't have a choice.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.880
-We'll help you.
-Grab it there.

31:56.960 --> 31:59.320
-Where?
-Just stretch it tight.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.120
-Who knows how to fold it?
-Not me.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.160
Triangle, right?

32:02.240 --> 32:04.880
-Are you sure?
-Red and blue mustn't touch.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.840
-Now what?
-Fold it in three.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.640
This way.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.520
-Blue has to be on top.
-No, not like that!

32:11.600 --> 32:14.840
-Blue and red can't touch?
-That goes there.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.000
That's it.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.120
Quick, hide it!

32:23.880 --> 32:26.160
-No one's coming.
-Quick.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.960
-Wait. That's it.
-Stretch it flat.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.640
Almost there.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.800
Now fold it like this.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.520
Then on the side.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.040
No, no!

32:35.120 --> 32:37.440
-Finished.
-All good?

32:37.520 --> 32:39.080
Go, go!

32:39.160 --> 32:40.480
Go, champ!

32:41.960 --> 32:44.200
-Go, champ!
-Quick, before he comes back.

32:44.280 --> 32:45.760
-C'mon.
-Hurry!

32:45.840 --> 32:47.360
More to the left!

32:47.440 --> 32:49.000
-C'mon!
-Faster!

32:49.080 --> 32:51.600
-Stop hassling me!
-We'll help you!

32:51.680 --> 32:53.200
Wait, don't rush me.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.560
Now flatten it.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.600
-That's it.
-Push.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.680
I'm trying to.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.160
You're almost there.

33:05.840 --> 33:10.760
-OK, got it.
-Good job. You rock.

33:19.960 --> 33:20.880
High class!

33:24.000 --> 33:25.320
You're real good.

33:27.360 --> 33:28.680
You only just realized?

33:34.840 --> 33:38.080
You were good too. You should dance again.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.240
Yeah, but…

33:39.320 --> 33:40.840
The PCB, Aktuel Force…

33:40.920 --> 33:43.960
They're the best. Next level.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.680
If you're not the best, you quit?

33:46.760 --> 33:47.600
Yeah.

33:52.480 --> 33:53.880
See this move?

33:53.960 --> 33:55.360
I sure do.

33:57.800 --> 33:58.880
It's for my crew.

33:59.960 --> 34:01.160
-Your crew?
-Yeah.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.280
What crew?

34:03.040 --> 34:05.640
Dora and I are forming a band.
Like Ladies Night.

34:05.720 --> 34:08.360
-Those girls at Globo?
-Yeah. They're killer.

34:09.080 --> 34:09.960
Know The Mice?

34:10.040 --> 34:10.920
No.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.880
Another all-girl crew.

34:13.520 --> 34:16.040
Know how many they are? 44.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.520
44 girls?

34:17.600 --> 34:19.600
-It's a collective.
-What's their thing?

34:19.679 --> 34:21.040
You know…

34:21.120 --> 34:24.239
Do they all get naked and put on tutus?

34:27.280 --> 34:29.440
The banker and his Saturday night porn!

34:32.239 --> 34:34.120
Speaking of porn, who's he?

34:34.199 --> 34:36.800
My ex. Hot, right?

34:36.880 --> 34:39.239
Hot? Can't even see his face.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.679
Poor guy.

34:40.760 --> 34:43.040
It's tiny, really tiny!

34:43.120 --> 34:45.520
I didn't want you to feel pressure.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.000
Me, feel pressure over that?

34:51.159 --> 34:52.520
No! Me?

34:56.920 --> 34:58.320
Wanna see a real hunk?

35:03.200 --> 35:05.200
I'll show you pressure. Here.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.560
No, here! Pressure everywhere!

35:07.640 --> 35:10.480
Oh man, the pressure!

35:10.560 --> 35:14.240
Oh, the pressure! Check me out!

35:14.320 --> 35:17.840
-He can't compete!
-Hi!

35:17.920 --> 35:19.240
Hi!

35:19.320 --> 35:20.760
How you doin'?

35:22.440 --> 35:24.520
-This is Bruno.
-Hello.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.240
Want to stay for dinner?

35:26.320 --> 35:28.200
Sure.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.840
-You have some really rare stuff.
-Yeah.

36:09.920 --> 36:10.880
I work at a label.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.120
We get loads of imports
before anyone else.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.880
Have a look. Knock yourself out.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.040
What's playing?

36:19.920 --> 36:20.840
<i>Anti Love Song</i>.

36:20.920 --> 36:21.800
By Betty Davis.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.720
Miles's wife. Know her?

36:23.800 --> 36:25.080
No.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.000
She was far less famous than him,

36:27.080 --> 36:29.080
but she really slayed it.

36:29.160 --> 36:32.560
He left her.
She was too crazy, too wild, supposedly.

36:32.640 --> 36:35.200
But she did her greatest work ever

36:35.280 --> 36:37.600
when she was on her own.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.280
She's an independent woman. Understand?

36:40.360 --> 36:41.680
Mom, we got that.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.600
OK?

36:43.960 --> 36:46.200
-Dinner's ready.
-Let me help you, ma'am.

36:46.280 --> 36:47.440
What are you doing?

36:47.520 --> 36:49.440
I made it, I'll carry it.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.640
Go sit down.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.760
Stop the music. We're eating.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.720
What do you do?

37:06.520 --> 37:07.360
What?

37:07.440 --> 37:09.440
In life. What do you do?

37:10.840 --> 37:12.520
Did you drop out of school?

37:12.600 --> 37:14.080
No, I graduated last year.

37:14.680 --> 37:17.160
I work in a bank now, but I plan to quit.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.040
Vivi tells me you're a graffer too.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.640
Yeah, totally.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.200
What's your tag?

37:24.280 --> 37:26.280
Kool Shen.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.560
But I tag NTM too. Depends.

37:28.640 --> 37:31.080
-We're a big crew.
-I haven't seen it.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.040
You have to go to the Northside.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.640
We bomb Line 13 mostly.

37:35.600 --> 37:36.720
Right.

37:36.800 --> 37:37.640
Like the food?

37:37.720 --> 37:39.480
-Yes.
-Stop talking, then.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.000
It's best when it's hot.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.280
Breakfast!

38:18.240 --> 38:19.360
Is this all we have?

38:20.560 --> 38:21.440
Great, huh?

38:22.040 --> 38:23.280
Here, look.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.240
With a bit of harissa…

38:26.800 --> 38:28.800
Delish and wakes you right up.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.960
Tell me a story.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.000
So I feel like I'm at the movies.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.600
-Are we out of coffee too?
-Dunno.

38:38.680 --> 38:41.000
Did you buy any?

38:41.080 --> 38:41.920
No.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.280
Then we don't have any.

38:45.560 --> 38:49.000
But this tea bag
has only been used five times.

38:49.080 --> 38:51.360
I'll get some groceries today.

38:51.440 --> 38:52.760
We've been paid?

38:53.920 --> 38:55.800
-Yeah, yeah.
-Awesome.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.080
No, leave it, I can…

38:59.160 --> 39:01.880
It's OK. I'm happy to do the shopping.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.200
Where's the rest?

39:07.280 --> 39:08.320
What rest?

39:08.400 --> 39:10.720
Wasn't Massadian supposed
to pay both of us?

39:10.800 --> 39:12.240
Yeah.

39:13.800 --> 39:14.880
What's up?

39:15.880 --> 39:18.840
-I didn't see him…
-Fuck!

39:18.920 --> 39:21.280
-He'll give it to me next time.
-Damn it.

39:22.320 --> 39:25.400
He's jerking us around.
He pays us peanuts as it is.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.480
Thanks to him, I work at Globo.

39:27.560 --> 39:28.960
Are you kidding me?

39:29.720 --> 39:32.640
People come for you, not him.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.440
I hear them at the door.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.880
You're only the best DJ in France.

39:37.440 --> 39:41.320
No one can touch you.
Seriously, think about it.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.040
There's what, 400 people a night?

39:44.120 --> 39:45.960
And you make 500 francs?

39:46.800 --> 39:49.280
That's chump change.
He's screwing us over.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.480
I'll talk to him. Enough is enough.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.000
Yeah.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.920
You're too nice, as I keep telling you.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.040
Hey, hang on.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.080
Be careful. You'll hurt yourself.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.440
There's tons to carry. You'll end up flat.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.600
Mind your back, protect your abs.

40:31.680 --> 40:35.120
Stabilize yourself,
lean the bag on your knee…

40:35.200 --> 40:37.280
Then up it goes. You try.

40:39.640 --> 40:40.880
Use your knee. Go on.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.440
That's it. Off you go.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.840
<i>58 police officers were injured…</i>

40:46.920 --> 40:49.080
-Where's the kid?
-Huh?

40:49.160 --> 40:50.280
Where's the kid?

40:50.360 --> 40:52.320
He just went for a pee.

40:52.400 --> 40:56.240
<i>…violent clashes between police</i>
<i>and isolated groups of youths…</i>

40:58.000 --> 40:59.440
Thought you'd quit on us.

40:59.520 --> 41:02.040
-Hungry?
-Sure am!

41:02.120 --> 41:06.360
<i>The national student committee</i>
<i>immediately condemned the actions.</i>

41:06.440 --> 41:09.840
How's our little banker?
Got a sore back yet?

41:12.160 --> 41:14.880
-It's hard at first, huh?
-No, it's OK.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.600
We'll work twice as hard then.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.920
When's the siesta?

41:21.000 --> 41:23.840
How come you ended up with us?

41:23.920 --> 41:25.720
Banking wasn't my thing.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.640
So what is your thing?

41:29.960 --> 41:31.280
<i>In the Latin Quarter,</i>

41:31.360 --> 41:34.160
<i>a 22-year-old male was beaten</i>

41:34.240 --> 41:37.560
<i>by riot police and died of a heart attack.</i>

41:37.640 --> 41:39.400
<i>The District Attorney stated</i>

41:39.480 --> 41:42.760
<i>that the cause of death</i>
<i>was decompensated heart failure</i>

41:42.840 --> 41:45.680
<i>resulting from a preexisting</i>
<i>renal condition.</i>

41:45.760 --> 41:48.400
<i>However, several witnesses</i>
<i>have since come forward</i>

41:48.480 --> 41:52.680
<i>and described the brutal beating</i>
<i>the victim endured.</i>

41:52.760 --> 41:56.080
<i>The young man wanted to go home.</i>

41:56.160 --> 42:00.520
<i>And they attacked him.</i>
<i>I think his name was Malik.</i>

42:00.600 --> 42:04.000
<i>They punched him,</i>
<i>clubbed him and kicked him.</i>

42:04.680 --> 42:08.920
<i>Cardiac massage was ineffective.</i>
<i>Malik Oussekine died</i>

42:09.000 --> 42:13.680
<i>of heart failure,</i>

42:13.760 --> 42:17.840
<i>The victim did sustain visible injuries</i>
<i>according to multiple eyewitnesses.</i>

42:17.920 --> 42:21.480
<i>Yet the DA maintains</i>
<i>that none of the injuries were fatal…</i>

42:28.880 --> 42:30.000
Start the anthem.

42:31.160 --> 42:34.880
<i>Arise, children of the Fatherland…</i>

42:34.960 --> 42:37.920
<i>The day of glory has arrived</i>

<i>Against us, tyranny's</i>

42:42.760 --> 42:45.320
<i>Bloody banner is raised</i>

42:46.080 --> 42:48.920
<i>Bloody banner is raised</i>

42:49.680 --> 42:53.040
<i>Listen to the sounds in the fields</i>

42:53.120 --> 42:56.160
<i>The roaring of those fearsome soldiers</i>

42:57.200 --> 43:00.080
<i>They're coming right into your arms</i>

43:00.160 --> 43:03.680
<i>To slit the throats</i>

<i>To arms, citizens…</i>

43:20.600 --> 43:22.560
Know how much he makes on the door?

43:22.640 --> 43:24.520
-40,000.
-40,000?

43:24.600 --> 43:25.800
-Yep.
-Wow.

43:25.880 --> 43:27.240
Wow is right.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.200
Your name draws the crowds.
You're making him rich.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.640
He's fucking us over.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.320
As I've been saying.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.160
Stop taking it.

43:44.000 --> 43:44.640
Hey.

43:44.720 --> 43:45.720
All good, kids?

43:48.680 --> 43:50.280
You're right, we'll talk to him.

44:04.760 --> 44:06.600
Dee Nasty, want a drink?

44:08.960 --> 44:10.040
Give them tequila.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.040
OK.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.640
Jacques, got a minute? Can we talk?

44:16.040 --> 44:17.160
You don't look well.

44:17.760 --> 44:18.840
A drink'll help.

44:21.760 --> 44:22.920
-Here.
-Thanks.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.960
I'm not happy with my pay.

44:31.480 --> 44:34.960
500 is the norm. It's what everyone gets.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.480
But I'm here from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

44:37.560 --> 44:40.200
I bring my own records.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.160
I'm a nice guy, but I can only…

44:42.240 --> 44:43.480
Are you tired?

44:44.000 --> 44:45.040
Need some "vitamins"?

44:45.120 --> 44:46.440
I thought you kicked.

44:46.520 --> 44:48.440
A gram costs more than your pay.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.680
500 is what you pay the bouncer!

44:50.760 --> 44:52.640
Aren't you from a vacant lot?

44:52.720 --> 44:54.280
I pack out your club.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.600
I know how much you make.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.160
Any idea of my overhead?

44:57.240 --> 44:58.560
Know what I spend?

44:58.640 --> 45:00.560
On advertising, renting gear?

45:00.640 --> 45:02.800
I can't perform miracles, pal.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.560
OK, I'll up you to 700
and pay for your records.

45:06.640 --> 45:07.680
That's it.

45:08.720 --> 45:09.840
Make it 3,000.

45:11.120 --> 45:12.360
3,000?

45:13.200 --> 45:14.280
3,000!

45:14.960 --> 45:16.640
Are you two on drugs?

45:16.720 --> 45:18.440
Don't push your luck!

45:18.520 --> 45:20.240
Two salaries add up!

45:20.320 --> 45:22.160
Excuse me?

45:23.840 --> 45:26.280
You're making twice as much, thanks to me!

45:26.360 --> 45:28.640
Stop treating our customers like shit.

45:28.720 --> 45:32.040
I had to placate reporters.
That's bad for business.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.800
Not happy? Go back to whoring!

45:33.880 --> 45:36.200
Excuse me, what did you just say?

45:36.280 --> 45:38.480
I want 10,000 or I quit right now!

45:40.200 --> 45:41.280
10,000?

45:42.800 --> 45:44.760
Don't fucking blackmail me!

45:44.840 --> 45:46.920
I want 10,000, you dumb fuck!

45:47.000 --> 45:48.760
Want me to go under, asshole?

45:48.840 --> 45:50.920
Stay out of this, slut! You're a bad DJ!

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Hardly worth 500 francs!

45:53.080 --> 45:55.800
-Get out of my sight for good!
-Very clever!

45:55.880 --> 45:59.360
When your club's empty,
you'll come crawling back.

45:59.440 --> 46:01.560
-You know shit about music!
-Get lost!

46:01.640 --> 46:02.760
You're replaceable!

46:03.440 --> 46:05.360
-Asshole!
-Fuck off and die, shithead.

46:11.880 --> 46:15.240
Why'd you ask for so much? That was dumb.

46:15.320 --> 46:17.240
To shut him up for good.

46:17.320 --> 46:19.920
But there are limits.
What were you thinking?

46:20.000 --> 46:23.960
-We just got fired.
-No, we weren't fired.

46:24.040 --> 46:26.120
We chose to quit.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.160
That's different.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.040
-Bullshit!
-I negotiated.

46:32.120 --> 46:36.080
I put my offer on the table.
He turned it down, that's all.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.440
So what? We don't need him anymore.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.080
Yeah, OK.

46:45.440 --> 46:46.760
So what do we do now?

46:52.080 --> 46:54.160
We move forward.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.120
This is just the start.

47:03.760 --> 47:05.280
Give me your hand.

47:05.360 --> 47:06.840
You'll get a big rush.

47:06.920 --> 47:07.960
How thoughtful!

47:09.120 --> 47:10.680
You're a fucking killer!

47:13.200 --> 47:14.280
Fuck me!

47:17.720 --> 47:19.680
Freedom, here I come!

47:19.760 --> 47:22.720
-I'm done with that army shit.
-Listen! Hear that?

47:22.800 --> 47:24.920
Let's go mess with them.

47:38.320 --> 47:39.840
Assassin!

47:39.920 --> 47:42.120
<i>My dexterous flows</i>
<i>And my righteous bros</i>

47:42.200 --> 47:45.560
<i>Give my words a divine aura</i>
<i>That gets you in a trance</i>

47:45.640 --> 47:46.720
<i>So dance!</i>

47:46.800 --> 47:49.000
<i>The beat is rising</i>
<i>Groove inspiring</i>

47:49.080 --> 47:51.040
<i>Like a bomb</i>
<i>Dropped from the sky</i>

47:51.120 --> 47:54.480
<i>Every word gonna fly</i>
<i>Like a tiny rainbow</i>

47:54.560 --> 47:55.600
<i>Shiny and wet</i>

47:55.680 --> 47:57.760
<i>In the bead of sweat</i>
<i>Runnin' down your face</i>

48:00.120 --> 48:03.320
You killed it, Solo! Now give 'em more!

48:03.400 --> 48:04.440
Give 'em more?

48:04.520 --> 48:06.520
-Give 'em more!
-OK, Rockin' Squat!

48:06.600 --> 48:09.440
<i>My head's a hurricane, ideas racin'</i>
<i>Life's a bowling lane</i>

48:09.520 --> 48:11.080
<i>And I'm a pin</i>

48:11.160 --> 48:13.360
<i>Pin of iron, glass or stone</i>

48:13.440 --> 48:15.080
<i>Guided by the best radar known</i>

48:15.160 --> 48:17.200
<i>To mankind</i>
<i>The mind!</i>

48:17.280 --> 48:20.320
<i>I analyze life and its twists</i>
<i>Get my drift?</i>

48:20.400 --> 48:22.960
<i>It takes more than words</i>
<i>To freeze my thoughts</i>

48:23.040 --> 48:25.120
<i>Or curdle my nerves</i>
<i>Solo success</i>

48:25.200 --> 48:27.320
<i>For success I obsess</i>
<i>Think big, be someone</i>

48:27.400 --> 48:28.400
<i>Wake up, son!</i>

48:28.480 --> 48:30.240
<i>Here's my message</i>
<i>For your mind</i>

48:30.320 --> 48:32.800
<i>Life's a ride</i>
<i>Which way? You decide!</i>

48:36.760 --> 48:38.840
Tell them who you are, Solo!

48:38.920 --> 48:41.760
<i>S for the sermon coloring my skin</i>
<i>And a smack of blood</i>

48:41.840 --> 48:44.680
<i>O for the oafs I'm gonna oust</i>
<i>With my verbal joust</i>

48:44.760 --> 48:46.840
<i>L for the liberty</i>
<i>That runs in my veins</i>

48:46.920 --> 48:50.200
<i>And O for my omnipresent style</i>
<i>In all I do, I'm versatile</i>

48:53.440 --> 48:55.320
Assassin!

49:25.360 --> 49:26.960
Hey Bruno, know who that is?

49:30.520 --> 49:31.720
Is he a cop?

49:31.800 --> 49:33.840
Didn't he rap at La Chapelle?

49:36.320 --> 49:37.640
Got a problem?

49:37.720 --> 49:39.320
You're my problem.

49:45.960 --> 49:48.440
You're freaking us out,
staring like a cop.

49:50.640 --> 49:55.200
If you wanna piss everywhere like dogs
to mark your territory, go ahead.

49:55.280 --> 49:58.800
But if you think you'll make a mark,
you're mistaken.

49:59.360 --> 50:00.600
Hip-hop has a hierarchy.

50:00.680 --> 50:01.720
Your shitty tags?

50:02.480 --> 50:04.760
They're nothing.
They're shit. Bottom level.

50:04.840 --> 50:07.480
We have graffers.
We respect them as artists.

50:07.560 --> 50:10.680
-They matter. We have dancers.
-You're so full of shit.

50:10.760 --> 50:13.240
And at the top, there's rap.

50:13.320 --> 50:16.120
-You're taking it too far.
-No I'm not.

50:16.200 --> 50:19.280
I'm talking to you about reality.
Rap is reality.

50:19.360 --> 50:21.280
The power of words.

50:21.360 --> 50:23.680
Rap is a science. A true art form.

50:23.760 --> 50:25.800
Watch out, 'cause I'm comin' for you.

50:25.880 --> 50:29.320
You say rap is "right at the top"
or whatever…

50:29.400 --> 50:31.800
But I'm gonna rip rap apart! I'm gonna…

50:31.880 --> 50:33.600
I'm gonna take rap over.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.680
You're gonna choke on your elitism!

50:35.760 --> 50:39.080
-We rap too.
-You two chumps are rappers?

50:39.880 --> 50:42.840
Next time you see us, look up.

50:42.920 --> 50:44.520
'Cause you'll be in the pit.

50:44.600 --> 50:45.680
Oh yeah?

51:14.160 --> 51:17.400
