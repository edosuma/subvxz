WEBVTT

00:01.252 --> 00:02.336
The fuck were you doing
last week

00:02.420 --> 00:04.338
that was more important
than watching <i>Shameless?</i>

00:04.422 --> 00:06.590
Protesting homophobia
and bigotry?

00:08.342 --> 00:09.510
Damn right you were.

00:09.593 --> 00:12.763
Now watch the show!

00:14.932 --> 00:16.767
They made a list
of the rapiest bars

00:16.851 --> 00:18.811
on the South Side,
and The Alibi's number one?

00:18.894 --> 00:21.689
I can't go to public school.
Hopkins made me soft.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.941
I have manners now.
I eat pâté.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.151
There's three weeks
of school left,

00:25.234 --> 00:26.402
and you got to go somewhere.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.945
What if I help you
get better grades?

00:28.029 --> 00:29.071
For free?

00:29.155 --> 00:31.323
No, for protection
from Cracker Girl.

00:31.407 --> 00:33.117
Okay, deal.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.953
Your political contributions
are welcome

00:36.037 --> 00:37.621
and most appreciated.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.124
Mo White is our only hope.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.001
You sure this isn't
about the money, Frank?

00:42.084 --> 00:44.420
Of course it's about
the money, Tommy.

00:44.503 --> 00:45.796
- You got a sister?
- Half-sister.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.924
She's been in and out of rehab,
like, 100 times.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.718
I look after her kid sometimes.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.054
The woman who owns
box 669--

00:53.137 --> 00:54.764
could you tell me about her?

00:54.847 --> 00:56.515
- I mean, what's she like?
- She's a junkie.

00:56.599 --> 00:58.100
Her daughter's in here
all the time looking for her.

00:58.184 --> 00:59.643
There's a kid...

00:59.727 --> 01:02.396
I want you to recommend
to West Point.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.441
I already recommended someone.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.443
- Oh!
- Bitch, I'm not asking.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.403
What's his name?

01:09.487 --> 01:11.363
Carl Gallagher.

01:11.447 --> 01:12.656
Aah!

01:12.740 --> 01:14.116
Why do you wear
an ankle bracelet

01:14.200 --> 01:16.452
that shocks you
when you get near a school?

01:16.535 --> 01:18.329
She told me she was 18.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.413
- But...
- But?

01:19.497 --> 01:20.915
She wasn't.

No.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.491
I'm not feeling so good.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.326
Think I'm coming down
with something.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.787
Buddy, it's not happening.
You're going to school. Go.

02:41.871 --> 02:44.165
It's a waste of time.
I'm not learning anything.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.749
Can you just homeschool me?

02:45.833 --> 02:48.127
No coffee.
Milk or juice.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.212
All the famous people
are homeschooled--

02:50.296 --> 02:52.548
Leonardo da Vinci,
Abe Lincoln,

02:52.631 --> 02:53.924
Justin Bieber.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.009
I don't see you
painting the ceiling

02:55.092 --> 02:57.011
of the Sistine Chapel
anytime soon, Biebs.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.095
Go.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.143
Hey, Carl, how much longer
those dogs

03:04.226 --> 03:05.561
gonna be dying down there?

03:05.644 --> 03:06.896
It's in God's hands now.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.314
Well, tell God to hurry
the fuck up, all right?

03:08.397 --> 03:09.523
The whole house stinks.

03:09.607 --> 03:10.941
I'm providing
an essential service

03:11.025 --> 03:13.360
to below-the-poverty-line
animal lovers

03:13.444 --> 03:15.154
while racking up
on community service hours

03:15.237 --> 03:16.322
for my West Point application.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.448
- It's a win-win.
- Hey.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.742
Military service
is for losers.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.535
Spoken like a true patriot.

03:21.619 --> 03:24.121
And I'll be proud to protect
your Constitutional right

03:24.205 --> 03:25.456
to be an asshole, Frank.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.541
- What's with the outfit?
- Got to hit the stump with Mo.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.959
Tomorrow's election day.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.044
We're fighting

03:30.127 --> 03:31.962
for the under-represented
Caucasian male.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.048
I think you're on the wrong
side of history on this one.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.382
Oh, I know Mo probably

03:35.466 --> 03:36.592
- isn't gonna win.
- Probably?

03:36.675 --> 03:37.801
But democracy's about

03:37.885 --> 03:39.303
fighting for what
you believe is right.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.512
And rounding up as much

03:40.596 --> 03:42.473
campaign contribution cash
as possible.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.309
Mo isn't taking money
from lobbyists

03:45.392 --> 03:46.810
and corporate elites.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.562
Only small donations

03:48.646 --> 03:50.731
from the local citizenry.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.024
'Cause nobody
with any sense

03:52.107 --> 03:53.234
would want to support
a pedophile.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.319
<i>Au contraire,</i>
fruit of my loins.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.529
No less a luminary
than the president

03:57.613 --> 03:58.781
of these United States

03:58.864 --> 04:02.493
supported a candidate
of questionable sexual history

04:02.576 --> 04:04.745
in regard to the chasing
of underage tail.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.830
Yeah, and the guy lost.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.250
How much you getting paid,
Frank?

04:09.333 --> 04:10.501
Here you go.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.961
I take a small stipend,

04:12.044 --> 04:14.296
as is the custom
for campaign managers.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.381
Might not want to wear
that shirt

04:15.464 --> 04:16.799
out of the house, Frank.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.759
Hey, you okay?

04:18.842 --> 04:20.177
Couldn't sleep.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.595
Got used to all the noise
in jail.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.264
It's too quiet here.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.683
First time anybody's ever
said that about this place.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.643
Hey, you meet
your public defender yet?

04:27.726 --> 04:30.646
Geneva and the Gay Jesus donors
got a lawyer for me.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.523
Rich queer,
too much time on his hands

04:32.606 --> 04:34.483
since same-sex marriage
got fixed.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.944
All right.
Hey, Xan, Liam, we got to go.

04:38.821 --> 04:40.656
Here you go.
Hey, uh, Ian,

04:40.739 --> 04:42.324
Debbie was supposed
to come home last night.

04:42.408 --> 04:44.243
Franny's sleeping upstairs.
Can you keep an eye on her

04:44.326 --> 04:45.703
until, uh, she gets back?

04:45.786 --> 04:46.954
Debbie didn't come home
last night?

04:47.037 --> 04:49.206
No, no, she said she was going
to see a band with some friend.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.959
Just like her mother,
ready to spread her legs

04:52.042 --> 04:55.421
for any guy with a wallet chain
and a flaming skull tattoo.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.634
Still Father of the Year,
Frank.

05:12.688 --> 05:16.442
<i>♪♪ Before you,
I was all alone ♪♪</i>

05:16.525 --> 05:18.193
You have time for breakfast?

05:18.277 --> 05:19.820
Yeah, sure.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.530
- I work swing today.
- Mm.

05:21.613 --> 05:22.614
Mm.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.491
Patsy's?

05:24.575 --> 05:26.493
Ah, you mind
if we stay in?

05:26.577 --> 05:28.329
I can make us some waffles.

05:28.412 --> 05:29.830
- Waffles?
- Yeah.

05:29.913 --> 05:30.914
I love waffles.

05:30.998 --> 05:31.999
Mm.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.668
And I have fresh strawberries.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.670
- Fresh strawberries?
- Mm-hmm.

05:36.754 --> 05:39.631
I love fresh strawberries.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.553
I just can't believe

05:44.636 --> 05:47.765
that Frank is supporting
that child-fucker Mo White.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.100
I'm surprised anything
Frank does still surprises you.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.518
You have time
to knock on a few doors

05:51.602 --> 05:53.604
for Ruiz with me later?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.397
Ruiz, not Wyman?

05:55.481 --> 05:57.691
Why would I support Wyman?

05:57.775 --> 05:59.318
'Cause she's a woman.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.111
Oh, I should support her

06:01.195 --> 06:03.364
just 'cause she's a woman?

06:03.447 --> 06:06.408
So you would never support
a woman 'cause you're a man?

06:06.492 --> 06:08.327
Ruiz is pro-development,
pro-business.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.661
He'll be good
for the South Side.

06:09.745 --> 06:12.414
And he'll be good for you.

06:12.498 --> 06:15.000
I'm not gonna apologize
for enlightened self-interest.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.169
That's what makes America work.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.129
Spoken like
a true robber baron.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.839
Spoken like a true socialist.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.633
I'm Irish--
free health care,

06:22.716 --> 06:23.801
free college tuition.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.887
Endless rain,
potato famine.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.889
Bit behind the times,
aren't you?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.099
It doesn't rain?

06:31.350 --> 06:32.684
Patsy's at 5:00.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.019
We'll hit Pilsen.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.105
We got to get
those Ruiz votes out

06:36.188 --> 06:38.357
so I can continue
exploiting the masses.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.484
Mm-hmm.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.083
Oh.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.584
Sure they wouldn't
have been better off

06:57.668 --> 06:59.711
if you'd just gassed them
like you were supposed to?

06:59.795 --> 07:02.131
I couldn't bring myself
to do it.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.799
How are you gonna order men
to kill the enemy

07:03.882 --> 07:06.093
if you can't put down
a couple of old dogs?

07:06.176 --> 07:07.553
What?

07:07.636 --> 07:09.930
That's what officers do--
order men to kill.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.598
What'd you think they were
gonna teach you at West Point,

07:11.682 --> 07:12.933
marching cadences?

07:13.016 --> 07:14.268
Is that what Gay Jesus
would do?

07:14.351 --> 07:16.103
What, kill old dogs?

07:16.186 --> 07:17.646
Hell, no.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.150
Gay Jesus is all
about inclusion and grace,

07:21.233 --> 07:23.068
but you're not looking
to get into Heaven.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.612
You want to lead
lean, mean murdering machines.

07:25.696 --> 07:26.905
Can't kill a couple
of old dogs,

07:26.989 --> 07:29.116
might be about time
to start considering...

07:29.199 --> 07:31.076
teaching kindergarten?

07:31.160 --> 07:32.161
Nursing school?

07:47.342 --> 07:48.927
You don't think someone
could misinterpret that sign?

07:49.011 --> 07:50.012
What?

07:50.095 --> 07:52.431
How? If you have
a vagina, you're safe.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.515
Vagina Safe Zone.

07:53.599 --> 07:54.641
But it could mean

07:54.725 --> 07:57.478
all the vaginas inside
are safe from disease.

07:57.561 --> 08:01.231
There is no way we are still
on that rapiest bar list.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.233
We have all the signed
sex consent forms,

08:03.317 --> 08:04.860
we took down
all the rapey posters

08:04.943 --> 08:06.612
and the bondage stuff.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.990
It's time to call that bitch
from the <i>Southside Beat</i>

08:10.073 --> 08:11.617
and get her back here
to re-inspect.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.038
Mo, where you been?

08:16.121 --> 08:18.290
I've been looking
all over for you.

08:18.373 --> 08:21.126
Today's about
getting out the Mo vote

08:21.210 --> 08:23.378
and rounding up a few more
campaign contributions

08:23.462 --> 08:24.880
while we still can.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.299
Bus'll be along any minute.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.313
You okay?

08:42.439 --> 08:45.234
Did you see the polls
in the <i>Tribune</i> this morning?

08:45.317 --> 08:47.152
They have us
at six percent, Frank.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.654
Six.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.198
I didn't get back into politics
to be humiliated.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.867
No, no, no, you got to look
at the glass as half-full.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.036
The <i>Tribune</i> had us at three
on Saturday.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.956
You've doubled your support
in two days.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.668
There's the bus.
Okay.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.169
Let's do it.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.172
Yeah?

09:08.382 --> 09:09.841
Mo?

09:13.971 --> 09:15.722
Eh...

09:17.391 --> 09:18.392
Mmm.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.685
These are wonderful waffles.

09:19.768 --> 09:20.686
Right?

09:20.769 --> 09:22.604
Right, thank you.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.231
- Very crispy.
- Mm-hmm.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.816
Nice.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.818
Mm.

10:11.653 --> 10:15.574
You have 20 minutes
to answer the ten questions.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.910
Don't spend all your time
on any one question.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.912
If you don't know
the answer,

10:20.996 --> 10:23.290
move on to the next
and come back

10:23.373 --> 10:25.250
if you have time left.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.295
Hi.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.630
Excuse me.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.340
Sorry. Okay.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.135
Sorry. Okay.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.514
Hey, Tyesha, what the hell
is this?

11:20.597 --> 11:21.598
Oh, your dad came by.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.350
He said you were okay
with him putting it up.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.352
Where is my Ru--

11:27.688 --> 11:28.897
Scotch tape, please.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.825
Okay. Last time.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.664
Enjoy.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.166
Hey.
Wyman?

11:48.250 --> 11:49.334
Give it.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.132
Take off the Wyman buttons.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.009
Guys, no electioneering
in the workplace.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.014
Thank you.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.601
No.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.729
No, absolutely not.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.355
Give it.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.649
You want me to start singing
<i>We Shall Overcome?</i>

12:12.733 --> 12:14.234
Loud?

12:17.487 --> 12:20.240
Anybody who agrees
to wear a Ruiz pin

12:20.323 --> 12:21.825
gets a free piece of pie.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.721
Our social media group

12:42.804 --> 12:44.014
is really taking off.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.308
77,000 new followers

12:46.391 --> 12:48.935
on social media
in the last five days.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.063
Chapters are springing up
all over the country,

12:52.147 --> 12:53.398
and even in Europe.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.859
The Gay Jesus Germans
have unsurprisingly

12:55.942 --> 12:58.236
turned militant quickly
and burned down

12:58.320 --> 13:00.864
two evangelical churches
in Stuttgart.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.785
- What's up?
- Who are they?

13:04.868 --> 13:05.869
Our Lesbian Legion

13:05.952 --> 13:07.829
from the MMA gym on Racine.

13:07.913 --> 13:11.082
Your gays turned out to be
too sweet to handle security.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.426
I'm in love.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.178
What's his name this time?

13:23.261 --> 13:24.262
Alex.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.473
Well, Alexandra.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.934
He's a she?

13:29.017 --> 13:31.436
Sort of.
She's pretty masculine.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.897
So you're a lesbian?

13:33.980 --> 13:35.857
Yeah, I am.

13:35.941 --> 13:37.692
No, you're not.
You have a kid.

13:37.776 --> 13:41.238
Carl, a lot of lesbians
have children, and besides,

13:41.321 --> 13:43.031
I hate men,
so maybe I am.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.325
We're in love,
and we're moving in together.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.873
- You gonna get that?
- Nope.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.792
Yo, I'm coming!

13:55.627 --> 13:56.628
You Carl Gallagher?

13:56.711 --> 13:57.712
Yeah.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.047
What the fuck?

13:59.130 --> 14:01.299
You took my recommendation
to West Point.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.718
Congressman Ubberman promised
it to me, and you stole it.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.220
I think you broke my nose!

14:05.303 --> 14:06.763
Now my dad says
I got to enlist in the Marines.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.223
And that's my problem how?

14:09.599 --> 14:10.892
What the fuck?
Stop hitting me!

14:10.976 --> 14:12.394
I'll fight you for it.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.854
A duel,
to the death if necessary.

14:13.937 --> 14:17.023
I challenged you.
You pick the weapons.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.525
Fists and feet,

14:18.608 --> 14:21.152
guns, knives, bats, bricks...

14:21.236 --> 14:22.779
What the fuck is a duel?

14:22.863 --> 14:25.323
Duty, country, honor--

14:25.407 --> 14:26.658
it's the West Point way.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.869
Meet at Damen Silos,
tomorrow at dusk.

14:28.952 --> 14:33.707
The person still breathing
gets the recommendation.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.171
I was staying at a motel
in Gary,

14:40.255 --> 14:42.424
laying asphalt
after high school.

14:42.507 --> 14:45.135
Invited the front-desk girl
to my room for a few beers.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.428
We ended up having sex,

14:46.511 --> 14:48.013
but she kind of cried
through the whole thing.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.097
What's that called?

14:49.180 --> 14:50.223
Did you stop?

14:50.307 --> 14:52.142
Banging her?
Hell, no.

14:52.642 --> 14:53.643
That's a Kobe.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.229
You think she wanted me
to stop?

14:56.313 --> 14:57.772
You think she was crying
because she was having

14:57.856 --> 14:59.316
a good time?

15:00.650 --> 15:02.444
What's a Weinstein?

15:02.527 --> 15:04.529
Being manipulative
and pathetic.

15:04.613 --> 15:05.864
About the only way
I ever get sex

15:05.947 --> 15:08.325
is being manipulative
and pathetic.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.119
You ever jack off
into a potted plant?

15:11.202 --> 15:13.079
Ask for massages
wearing an open bathrobe?

15:13.163 --> 15:14.164
Hmm?

15:14.623 --> 15:15.874
Rape a couple dozen?

15:15.957 --> 15:17.500
Allegedly.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.752
No.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.879
Then you're probably
an Ansari.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.214
What's an Ansari?

15:23.298 --> 15:24.633
That's just being a dick.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.343
Slipped a woman
a Quaalude once.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.011
- Then fucked her?
- Mm-hmm.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.137
A Cosby.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.681
What about that handsy Dr. Rob
at the clinic,

15:31.765 --> 15:34.184
with the deep body hugs
and the butt pats?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.353
- A Lasseter.
- Who the hell's that?

15:36.895 --> 15:38.438
Cartoon guy.
He made <i>Toy Story.</i>

15:38.521 --> 15:39.898
I love <i>Toy Story.</i>

15:39.981 --> 15:41.441
Buzz Lightyear!

15:41.524 --> 15:43.026
- Holy shit.
- What?

15:43.109 --> 15:45.236
- Willy wagging.
- CK.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.113
I mean, I slept
with a woman

15:47.197 --> 15:49.115
I was dating's 19-year-old
daughter last year.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.158
That got a name?

15:50.241 --> 15:51.743
That's a Woody Allen.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.119
W--she made all
the first moves, though.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.621
You're gonna need
a bigger board

15:54.704 --> 15:55.705
for your list, babe.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.375
Consent, gentlemen.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.919
A clear and verbal consent

16:01.002 --> 16:03.088
to participate
in sexual activity,

16:03.171 --> 16:04.839
freely given and reversible.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.967
Even if we're both naked
and already doing it?

16:07.050 --> 16:08.593
Even if you're already naked

16:08.677 --> 16:09.678
and banging.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.429
When she says "stop,"
you stop.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.765
Kevin Ball?

16:13.848 --> 16:14.975
That's me.

16:15.058 --> 16:17.310
Beth Watson, <i>Southside Beat.</i>

16:18.436 --> 16:20.981
Beth, thank you for coming.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.401
Can I get you something?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.653
Maybe a chilled glass
of Chablis

16:26.736 --> 16:28.113
or a Cosmo?

16:28.196 --> 16:29.906
Whiskey, neat.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.751
That dentist
came by again.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.379
Still wants to buy
that bike you rebuilt.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.256
Said he'd pay you
two grand over book.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.216
It's not for sale.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.010
Two grand?

16:50.093 --> 16:51.928
Sentimental value.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.140
There's a lady
up front looking for you, Lip.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.850
- What's she want?
- Didn't say.

17:02.772 --> 17:03.773
Hi.

17:03.857 --> 17:04.858
You Lip?

17:04.941 --> 17:06.651
Yeah.

17:06.735 --> 17:08.611
My sister says
you have my kid.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.157
Xan.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.284
I want her back.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.539
Where is she?

17:19.622 --> 17:20.749
She's at school.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.834
Where?
I got to go get her.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.674
Where are you living?

17:29.758 --> 17:31.634
What?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.386
Where will Xan live?

17:33.470 --> 17:36.014
None of your goddamn business.
Where's my kid?

17:36.097 --> 17:38.016
No, not until you tell me
where she's gonna be living.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.601
We got an appointment.

17:39.684 --> 17:40.977
- Oh, you have an appointment?
- Tell me where she is.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.187
What kind
of appointment, huh?

17:42.270 --> 17:44.314
With Social Services?
You need to show up...

17:44.397 --> 17:45.523
- Give me my fucking kid!
- ...with Xan so you can

17:45.607 --> 17:47.025
keep collecting your benefits?

17:47.484 --> 17:48.485
And then what, you're gonna

17:48.568 --> 17:49.611
dump her back out
on to the streets?

17:49.694 --> 17:50.737
Who the fuck do you think--

17:50.820 --> 17:51.821
I'm someone who gives a shit

17:51.905 --> 17:52.906
about your daughter!

17:52.989 --> 17:53.990
Jesus, what the hell's

17:54.074 --> 17:55.075
going on out here?

17:55.158 --> 17:56.576
I got customers.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.044
I want her back.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.926
What was that all about?

18:27.732 --> 18:30.151
<i>♪♪ No more hippies ♪♪</i>

18:30.235 --> 18:33.113
<i>♪♪ Stealing daisies ♪♪</i>

18:33.196 --> 18:35.281
<i>♪♪ These ladies ♪♪</i>

18:36.741 --> 18:40.036
<i>♪♪ No longer lazy ♪♪</i>

18:48.670 --> 18:49.838
Fuck, yeah.

18:50.421 --> 18:51.840
You won't regret it, sir.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.550
Remember, a vote for Mo White

18:53.633 --> 18:55.176
is a vote for the way
things used to be

18:55.260 --> 18:56.803
- and can be again, huh?
- You got it.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.304
Take care.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.223
Ooh.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.558
Every little bit

19:01.641 --> 19:04.144
helps to save our South Side,
Mr. Nowakowski.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.396
Most people give a 20,
but a 50

19:06.479 --> 19:07.939
would make you
a true American patriot.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.024
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.527
Oh, this is a-a $5.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.529
Did you think it was a $50?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.159
Oh, fuck.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.870
Washington
is a fascinating place.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.746
Incredible opportunities

19:23.830 --> 19:25.790
for young
student citizen interns.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.501
Hello, girls.
Oh.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.462
Well, it's--you're too young
to vote in this election,

19:31.546 --> 19:32.839
but you make sure to register

19:32.922 --> 19:34.132
the minute you hit puberty.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.009
Okay?
Off you go.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.468
Off you go.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.391
Hello, Kitty.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.393
That's not how you say it, Mo.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.523
Liam.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.942
Am I in some kind
of trouble?

19:53.026 --> 19:54.903
No.
We've been monitoring

19:54.986 --> 19:57.071
your test results
during your first weeks here

19:57.155 --> 19:58.448
at Richard Milhous Nixon,

19:58.531 --> 20:01.201
and we don't think we placed
you in the right grade.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.660
Am I getting held back?

20:02.744 --> 20:04.245
That happens a lot
in my family.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.080
No, we're moving you up.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.126
Let's try you in Mrs. Metzler's
class this fall.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.669
She teach third grade?

20:11.753 --> 20:13.004
Uh, no.
Sixth.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.090
Oh.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.686
Guys, guys,
don't stare,

20:28.770 --> 20:30.688
but three women
just walked into the bar.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.400
I said don't stare.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.736
V, look.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.280
Ladies!

20:39.989 --> 20:41.783
We're off the rapiest bar list.

20:41.866 --> 20:42.867
No shit?

20:42.951 --> 20:44.661
And there is a picture of you

20:44.744 --> 20:46.454
standing out front.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.415
- I look good.
- Hell, yeah, you do.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.919
Oh, man, it's working!

20:53.503 --> 20:55.546
Just sit anywhere
you like, ladies.

20:55.630 --> 20:56.839
Thank you.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.008
She says we are now

20:59.092 --> 21:00.510
the most female friendly

21:00.593 --> 21:02.178
dive bar on the South Side.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.389
Boom.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.766
- C-can you--
- I got it.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.728
You the, uh,
Vagina Safe guy?

21:11.312 --> 21:13.189
Yes.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.524
I'm Bill Doyle.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.235
I own the Spread Eagle
on 52nd.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.319
Oh, yeah, I know the place.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.737
Uh, deep-fried pickles, right?

21:20.530 --> 21:22.156
So, um...

21:23.032 --> 21:24.701
I was number two
on the rapey bar list.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.287
Then you got off it,
so now I'm number one.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.082
Sorry to hear that, Bill.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.335
You already got women
coming in. Wow.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.212
How'd you turn it around?

21:36.754 --> 21:38.756
I had to take
an honest inventory

21:38.840 --> 21:40.591
about how The Alibi
was contributing

21:40.675 --> 21:42.093
to the oppression of women

21:42.176 --> 21:44.554
and help furthering
the patriarchy.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.599
So maybe you could
stop by the Eagle

21:48.683 --> 21:50.226
and give me a few pointers,

21:50.310 --> 21:51.728
you know?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.563
I mean, I'm willing
to pay you for your time.

21:59.986 --> 22:00.987
Have a seat, Bill.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.492
- Hey, Xan.
- Hey, Renee.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.202
Hey.

22:08.286 --> 22:09.537
How was school today?

22:09.620 --> 22:10.872
Same.

22:10.955 --> 22:11.956
Eh?

22:13.708 --> 22:15.710
Uh, your snacks
are in the fridge.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.053
You gonna tell her
about her mom?

22:25.928 --> 22:27.055
Why?

22:27.138 --> 22:30.224
Can't see myself
giving her back to a junkie.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.270
Look, she'd be
Dumpster diving,

22:34.354 --> 22:35.938
sleeping in a cardboard box.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.024
She's still her mom.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.361
Call DCFS.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.780
They deal with this shit
all the time.

22:44.322 --> 22:45.656
I know you're trying
to be a good guy,

22:45.740 --> 22:47.950
but you should've called
a long time ago.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.162
<i>Come back tomorrow</i>

22:51.245 --> 22:53.039
with an "I Voted" sticker,
and you get free nachos.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.123
You're going to hell.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.583
It's the way of the world,
Tyesha.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.126
Every vote can be bought.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.295
Some votes are just cheaper
than others.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.172
You don't think
giving away nachos

23:01.255 --> 23:04.300
for the Hispanic guy
is maybe a tiny bit racist?

23:04.384 --> 23:07.637
Ruiz is from Puerto Rico.
Nachos are from Mexico.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.097
Hey, Jorge.

23:10.264 --> 23:12.183
- You registered to vote?
- Yeah.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.935
You want to come in
a little later tomorrow,

23:14.018 --> 23:15.269
have time to get
your family and friends

23:15.353 --> 23:16.646
to the polls for Ruiz?

23:16.729 --> 23:18.481
I'm not voting for Ruiz.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.607
Hey.

23:19.690 --> 23:20.691
Some handsome Irish dude

23:20.775 --> 23:22.276
out here waiting for you.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.529
Hi.
Is it 5:00 already?

23:24.612 --> 23:27.031
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, uh, we'll hit Pilsen.

23:27.115 --> 23:28.908
Then we'll go over
to Logan Square.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.368
The son of an Irish socialist

23:30.451 --> 23:33.037
helping a capitalist
convince the immigrant masses

23:33.121 --> 23:35.123
to vote against
their own interests.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.375
James Connolly
would be spinning in his grave.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.626
Who?

23:38.709 --> 23:40.420
James Connolly.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.927
Hey, you're Ian, right?

23:48.010 --> 23:49.429
Gay Jesus.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.390
Yeah.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.766
Um...

23:53.850 --> 23:56.352
I've been watching
your videos with my friends.

23:56.436 --> 24:00.356
Burning vans, the sermons...
It's inspiring.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.941
Thanks.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.152
You really believe
that's what Jesus was teaching?

24:04.235 --> 24:06.112
What, inclusion, love
and acceptance for all?

24:06.195 --> 24:08.865
Yeah, absolutely.

24:09.449 --> 24:12.577
You don't think God sees
homosexual bestiality

24:12.660 --> 24:16.164
as a sinful perversion
of His divine creation?

24:16.247 --> 24:17.331
What?

24:17.415 --> 24:19.292

25:34.659 --> 25:36.035
Hello, sir?
Sorry to bother you.

25:36.118 --> 25:37.453
My name's Carl Gallagher.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.205
I'm hoping
to go to West Point next year,

25:39.288 --> 25:41.832
but I've lost
my killer instinct.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.042
Word is around the neighborhood

25:43.125 --> 25:45.586
you're a highly decorated
haji-killing machine.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.004
I was hoping you can
give me some pointers

25:47.088 --> 25:49.549
on how to get
my homicidal mojo back.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.376
I just couldn't bring myself
to do it.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.421
When they look up at you
with those big, sad eyes,

27:10.504 --> 27:13.132
you can see the life
you're gonna be taking.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.675
Yeah, but that's dogs, kid.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.220
I mean, I couldn't kill a dog.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.931
Oh, we had
this straggly little fucker

27:21.015 --> 27:22.516
following us around
during my third tour

27:22.600 --> 27:24.685
in Kandahar.

27:24.769 --> 27:26.771
Fleas jumping off of him.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.439
Smelled like
an Iraqi shithouse.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.609
I loved that little pooch.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.820
Ah, I couldn't kill a dog.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.573
But hajis?

27:37.657 --> 27:39.325
Oh, you betcha.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.244
See these?

27:45.289 --> 27:47.041
Confirmed kills.

27:47.917 --> 27:50.002
I promise you,
first one is the toughest.

27:50.086 --> 27:51.545
After that...

27:51.629 --> 27:53.214
it's a hot knife
through butter.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.008
You know who kills dogs?

27:56.467 --> 27:57.927
Hajis.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.137
Yeah, they eat 'em,
too, okay?

28:00.221 --> 28:02.431
You think about that
when you're killing them.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.934
Okay, they eat your dogs.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.561
And if dogs don't work for you,

28:07.645 --> 28:09.230
then you imagine
they want to kill

28:09.313 --> 28:10.940
your sister or your buddy,

28:11.023 --> 28:13.442
and you imagine that that man

28:13.526 --> 28:15.861
at the receiving end of your
burst of automatic weapon fire

28:15.945 --> 28:17.363
wants to kill your mother.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.572
My mother's dead, sir.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.157
And guess who killed her.

28:20.241 --> 28:23.452
That fucker you just shot
in the face with your M4.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.080
Well, I guess I took
the West Point recommendation

28:26.163 --> 28:28.165
from a kid who had
the spot on it before,

28:28.249 --> 28:29.583
pissed him off, and...

28:29.667 --> 28:31.919
he came over
and challenged me to a duel.

28:32.002 --> 28:33.671
Whoever lives gets to go.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.549
Yeah, that's
typical officer bullshit.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.217
Joker have soft hands?

28:38.300 --> 28:40.136
I didn't feel his hands.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.388
This might be
just the chance you need

28:42.471 --> 28:44.014
to get your kill-feet wet.

28:44.098 --> 28:45.099
I mean, he challenged you,

28:45.182 --> 28:46.392
so you get to pick
the weapons, right?

28:46.475 --> 28:48.477
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

28:49.145 --> 28:50.855
Pick rifles...

28:50.938 --> 28:53.524
and then shoot the bastard
in the fucking face.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.364
Hi, I'm with Mo White.

29:00.448 --> 29:01.866
We're hoping you'll make
a contribution

29:01.949 --> 29:04.118
to help keep the--

29:04.660 --> 29:05.786
Hi, I'm Mo White.

29:05.870 --> 29:06.871
I'm running for C--

29:06.954 --> 29:08.622
Hi, I'm Mo--

29:08.706 --> 29:10.791
Hi, there.
Is your mother home?

29:11.459 --> 29:12.835
Hi, I'm with Mo--

29:12.918 --> 29:14.420
Hi, I'm Mo White.

29:14.962 --> 29:16.213
Hi, I'm Mo W--

29:25.389 --> 29:29.185
Hey, what do you say we find
a spot to knock back a few,

29:29.268 --> 29:32.855
then look for more promising
Mo White territory?

29:32.938 --> 29:34.857
Maybe that titty bar on Keller,

29:34.940 --> 29:38.235
the one with the Confederate
battle flags?

29:39.069 --> 29:41.155
Yeah, it felt good,
telling the truth,

29:41.238 --> 29:42.948
letting people know
what I really think.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.784
Doesn't happen much
in politics.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.871
You know, I wasn't expecting
to actually win,

29:48.954 --> 29:51.248
but single digits...

29:51.332 --> 29:52.625
My old friends in Congress

29:52.708 --> 29:54.293
would be laughing
their asses off.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.712
It's all the illegals
who can vote now.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.589
Otherwise, you'd be winning
for sure.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.716
I guess.

30:00.800 --> 30:01.967
What were you hoping for?

30:02.843 --> 30:04.470
20%, 22%.

30:04.553 --> 30:05.971
Maybe force a runoff.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.140
A runoff?

30:08.224 --> 30:09.850
Yeah, a few extra weeks

30:09.934 --> 30:12.478
to make my case
to the voters.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.647
Ah, fuck it.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.273
I'm gonna go over
to Chuck E. Cheese,

30:16.357 --> 30:19.109
watch the girls
jump into the foam pit.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.029
Thanks, Frank.

30:23.197 --> 30:24.240
For what?

30:24.323 --> 30:25.825
For believing.

30:32.748 --> 30:35.835
Hi. A vote for Ruiz
is a vote for the future.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.336
<i>Gracias.</i>

30:37.419 --> 30:38.879
Hi.
Election's tomorrow.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.339
- Don't forget to vote.
- Thanks.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.384
Why all this sudden passion
for Ruiz?

30:43.968 --> 30:45.803
Wyman always seems to be
on the right side of things.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.888
Wyman supported
Lift the Ban.

30:47.972 --> 30:48.973
Lift the Ban?

30:49.056 --> 30:50.766
Election day is tomor--

30:50.850 --> 30:52.810
Yeah, rent control.
She's for it.

30:52.893 --> 30:56.105
Ah. And Ruiz opposes it?

30:56.188 --> 30:57.940
He's a businessman.
He gets it.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.276
Rents are getting pretty high.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.777
So are property taxes

31:01.861 --> 31:04.196
and utility costs
for apartment owners.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.950
Working people need somewhere
affordable to live as well.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.952
Yeah, and the city
should build them some.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.537
There's lots
of weed-filled lots

31:11.620 --> 31:13.247
all around here
to build low-income housing

31:13.330 --> 31:14.790
without sticking
apartment owners like me

31:14.874 --> 31:17.585
with more regulations
and bureaucracy.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.087
What?

31:20.170 --> 31:21.505
Nothing.

31:21.589 --> 31:22.590
No, go on.
Say it.

31:23.507 --> 31:24.633
Don't think that I'd better.

31:24.717 --> 31:26.135
What, that--

31:26.218 --> 31:28.429
that I'm a traitor to my class?

31:28.512 --> 31:30.055
That rent control is there
to protect

31:30.139 --> 31:32.224
people like me and my family,
poor people?

31:32.308 --> 31:33.517
Something like that, yeah.

31:33.601 --> 31:35.352
I've worked my ass off
every single day

31:35.436 --> 31:37.021
since I'm ten years old

31:37.104 --> 31:38.772
to get a little something
for myself,

31:38.856 --> 31:41.066
and now the city
wants to tell me

31:41.150 --> 31:42.568
how much rent
I should charge?

31:42.651 --> 31:43.652
Why?

31:43.736 --> 31:47.489
So that deadbeats like Frank
can leech off disability

31:47.573 --> 31:49.199
and live in my
rent-controlled apartments

31:49.283 --> 31:51.952
while I can barely keep up
with rising costs?

31:56.624 --> 31:58.042
Is that why you didn't want
to say anything?

31:58.125 --> 31:59.585
Pretty much, yeah.

32:04.131 --> 32:05.966
You get all your homework done?

32:06.926 --> 32:08.427
Yeah?

32:29.406 --> 32:31.116
Do you want
to stay with me here?

32:33.243 --> 32:35.204
If your mom
doesn't come back?

32:36.205 --> 32:37.623
Forever?

32:42.628 --> 32:44.755
Yeah, that'd be good.

33:17.538 --> 33:18.664
Hey.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.124
Hey.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.292
You all right?

33:22.376 --> 33:23.585
Not really.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.587
Think I might have
pulled a hamstring.

33:25.671 --> 33:26.672
Yeah?
How?

33:26.755 --> 33:28.799
Running from homophobes.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.180
I guess there's
nothing new about that, right?

33:42.730 --> 33:45.524
Think you could do hard time?

33:46.734 --> 33:48.610
What, in prison?

33:48.694 --> 33:50.279
Uh...

33:50.863 --> 33:52.031
Rather not.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.743
Gay Jesus kids don't want me
to cop a plea.

33:55.826 --> 33:57.995
Want me to take it to trial,

33:58.078 --> 34:00.497
get as much publicity
for the cause as I can.

34:01.749 --> 34:03.417
Yeah, and what's
your lawyer say?

34:04.001 --> 34:06.962
Could be looking at 10 to 15
if I don't take a deal.

34:18.932 --> 34:22.144
You, uh, hearing Shim again?

34:24.563 --> 34:25.898
Sometimes.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.735
Well...

34:30.444 --> 34:32.071
...what's Shim think?

34:34.656 --> 34:36.241
Unclear.

34:40.329 --> 34:42.581
Xan's mom showed up today.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.294
She's a junkie...

34:48.170 --> 34:49.838
hooking.

34:51.882 --> 34:53.592
What are you gonna do?

34:57.262 --> 34:58.680
I don't know.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.687
Maybe you should try
asking Shim.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.275
Yeah, maybe.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.571
You know, I just realized

35:14.655 --> 35:15.823
I never really established

35:15.906 --> 35:18.158
any clear boundaries
with Sara, you know?

35:18.242 --> 35:19.368
Mm.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.702
You know, she was
the last person

35:20.786 --> 35:22.621
I ever let go down on me.

35:22.704 --> 35:25.374
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a trust thing.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.126
We were engaged.

35:27.209 --> 35:29.837
We had already picked out the
names of our first three kids.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.839
We already reserved
our burial plots.

35:31.922 --> 35:34.758
- You were engaged?
- Yeah, twice.

35:34.842 --> 35:36.218
You ever think
about getting married?

35:36.760 --> 35:39.263
Yeah, lots of times.

35:39.346 --> 35:40.347
Mm-hmm.

35:40.430 --> 35:43.058
There was Matty and Derek,

35:43.142 --> 35:44.810
Franny's dad,

35:44.893 --> 35:48.730
and Neil, but that was
just kind of for the cash.

35:49.356 --> 35:51.483
I thought it would be weird
having sex without penises,

35:51.567 --> 35:53.527
but it's not that bad.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.237
There's also other things
we get to do, too,

35:55.320 --> 35:56.780
that are pretty good.

35:56.864 --> 35:57.865
It's not so messy.

35:57.948 --> 36:00.701
We don't have to worry
about birth control...

36:00.784 --> 36:02.786
I mean, Matty did have
a really big dick,

36:02.870 --> 36:04.580
which was super great
and everything,

36:04.663 --> 36:05.998
and Derek really knew
what he was doing

36:06.081 --> 36:08.208
and had such a good body.

36:09.626 --> 36:11.044
I don't know.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.339
Having sex with a girl
is like...

36:15.507 --> 36:17.509
It's kind of like
having sex with yourself.

36:17.593 --> 36:19.344
You know?

36:31.231 --> 36:33.400
Down!

36:33.483 --> 36:34.484
Down, Adolf!

36:34.568 --> 36:36.195
Down!

36:37.988 --> 36:39.198
Jesus!

36:39.907 --> 36:41.825
What the fuck you want?

36:42.659 --> 36:44.244
I heard you got out,
Milkovich.

36:44.328 --> 36:45.662
Couple weeks.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.789
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Why?

36:47.873 --> 36:50.584
Want to help a good man
save the South Side?

36:51.251 --> 36:52.836
You paying?

36:54.796 --> 36:56.506
Yeah.

37:08.435 --> 37:09.811
Oh.

37:10.270 --> 37:11.980
What, you headed
to church, Frank?

37:12.064 --> 37:13.232
Got to head out early,

37:13.315 --> 37:14.358
convince the Mo voters

37:14.441 --> 37:15.859
to get to the polls.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.361
Mo voters.

37:17.444 --> 37:18.862
What, is there a branch
of the Klan

37:18.946 --> 37:20.530
somewhere around here?

37:20.614 --> 37:23.283
God-fearing
European-American patriots

37:23.367 --> 37:25.410
are everywhere, son.

37:25.494 --> 37:27.329
Carl, you gonna vote?

37:27.412 --> 37:29.748
- Too young.
- Ian?

37:29.831 --> 37:31.541
Doubt it.
What's the point?

37:31.625 --> 37:32.751
Lip?

37:32.834 --> 37:33.961
Not registered.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.548
How are we ever gonna effect
real change in this country

37:38.632 --> 37:41.677
if our young citizens
refuse to participate?

37:42.177 --> 37:43.262
Now, you do know it's illegal

37:43.345 --> 37:44.721
to ask
for campaign contributions

37:44.805 --> 37:46.139
after you lose
an election, right?

37:46.223 --> 37:49.851
Well, you never know.
Could force a runoff.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.576
You're up early.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.495
Wanted to vote before work.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.538
You can vote?

38:09.621 --> 38:12.291
Yes.
I'm a citizen.

38:12.374 --> 38:13.750
Eight years.

38:16.128 --> 38:17.129
Who'd you vote for?

38:18.338 --> 38:19.881
Wouldn't you like to know?

38:21.717 --> 38:23.176
Wyman?

38:25.220 --> 38:26.596
Mo?

38:27.431 --> 38:30.017
Eh, definitely not Mo.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.773
There's bacon and half
an omelet in the oven.

38:37.316 --> 38:38.984
See you later.

38:43.030 --> 38:44.156
Hi.
Good morning.

38:45.324 --> 38:48.160
Uh, is it my turn
to pick breakfast today?

38:48.243 --> 38:49.745
I could make us some eggs.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.955
Uh, no.
Actually, I kin--um...

38:52.039 --> 38:53.957
I kind of got to get to work,
so...

38:54.041 --> 38:55.042
Oh.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.469
Bye.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.114
Think I could kill
a man, Jasper?

39:26.198 --> 39:29.242
Think I could do it?
Shoot him in the face?

39:29.326 --> 39:32.204
Watch his brains
blow out the back of his head

39:32.287 --> 39:35.040
as the life slowly drains
from his eyes

39:35.999 --> 39:38.794
and his blood puddles
at my feet?

39:57.562 --> 40:00.273
Okay, just sort of
spread out, casual.

40:00.357 --> 40:01.733
Easy, casual.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.485
Put the chain away.
Thank you.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.404
Okay.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.950
Okay, half now,

40:10.033 --> 40:11.493
half when the polls close.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.495
No violence,
no verbal threats.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.205
Just act scary.

40:15.288 --> 40:16.790
Got it.

40:17.999 --> 40:20.794

You can't be out here.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.603
Those shirts
are advocating for a candidate.

40:38.687 --> 40:41.356
No, no, these proud
men and women

40:41.440 --> 40:44.192
of European extraction
are just exercising their right

40:44.276 --> 40:46.111
to free expression...

40:46.194 --> 40:48.405
and comfortable
warm-weather outerwear.

40:48.488 --> 40:50.991
No electioneering
outside of polling places.

40:51.074 --> 40:52.909
I'm waiting for my mother
to get out of Mass

40:52.993 --> 40:54.327
so we can vote together.

41:18.727 --> 41:20.645
Hey, I didn't see you
come in.

41:20.729 --> 41:22.105
Oh, I came in the back.

41:22.189 --> 41:23.398
All the applause and hugging

41:23.482 --> 41:26.985
when I come in the front
is kind of... weird.

41:27.068 --> 41:28.695
What is this?

41:28.778 --> 41:32.073
Oh, just a couple
of the arty kids are...

41:32.157 --> 41:35.994
working up a few ideas
for if you do end up in prison.

41:39.247 --> 41:42.459
Couple assholes in a van
chased me last night.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.211
Apparently, they're not
very big fans

41:44.294 --> 41:46.546
of my interpretations
of Biblical verse.

41:46.630 --> 41:48.131
Fuckers.

41:48.215 --> 41:51.051
I'll get you a couple
of Lesbian League bodyguards.

41:51.134 --> 41:54.179
They'd love nothing more than
a chance to stomp homophobes.

41:59.392 --> 42:01.853
Think any of this is gonna
end up making a difference?

42:03.563 --> 42:04.898
Ian, you've given thousands

42:04.981 --> 42:07.275
of gay and lesbian teenagers
a voice.

42:07.359 --> 42:10.403
You've inspired us to stand up
and fight for ourselves.

42:10.487 --> 42:11.738
You know what I was thinking

42:11.821 --> 42:14.616
when I was running away
from those bastards?

42:14.699 --> 42:17.160
It's been 2,000 years
since Jesus died on the cross,

42:17.244 --> 42:18.870
and I'm still running
for my life down an alley

42:18.954 --> 42:21.706
'cause I fall in love with men
instead of women.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.127
Yeah.

42:26.836 --> 42:28.630
Just got a 911 from Antifa.

42:28.713 --> 42:29.881
Bunch of Nazis
are keeping people

42:29.965 --> 42:32.133
from voting
at an elementary school.

42:35.303 --> 42:36.763
Jeez, what's with the suit?

42:36.846 --> 42:38.890
We have a new
consulting business--

42:38.974 --> 42:40.308
Vagina Safe.

42:40.392 --> 42:42.435
It's <i>Good Housekeeping</i>
Seal of Approval,

42:42.519 --> 42:43.812
but for not being rapey.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.647
We're doing an inspection.

42:45.730 --> 42:48.066
We check out bars and make sure
that they're safe for women.

42:48.149 --> 42:50.819
Mm, definitely not gonna
be safe wearing that outfit.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.029
You see, that's exactly what
we're talking about, Tommy.

42:53.113 --> 42:54.739
A woman should feel free

42:54.823 --> 42:57.534
to dress however slutty
she wants, whenever.

42:57.617 --> 42:59.494
?
- "Slutty?
- No, baby, not you.

42:59.578 --> 43:01.371
You know,
other women who are slutty.

43:01.454 --> 43:03.623
We award the bars
one, two, or three vaginas

43:03.707 --> 43:04.791
after our inspection.

43:04.874 --> 43:09.254
- Three vaginas are the safest.
- What is that?

43:09.337 --> 43:11.256
Spy camera.
Cool, huh?

43:11.881 --> 43:13.550
What's up with you?
You okay?

43:14.301 --> 43:16.511
Well, I'm heading over
to vote, but...

43:16.595 --> 43:18.763
Ford got in my head,
and now I'm not sure I'm doing

43:18.847 --> 43:21.224
the right thing
voting for Ruiz.

43:21.308 --> 43:23.226
You're definitely
not doing the right thing.

43:24.144 --> 43:26.813
Why does everyone think
I'm supposed to vote for Wyman?

43:26.896 --> 43:28.023
Just 'cause she's a woman?

43:28.106 --> 43:30.275
Ruiz is
a successful businessman.

43:30.358 --> 43:31.735
He knows
how to get things done.

43:31.818 --> 43:34.237
That "successful businessmen
in Washington" shit's

43:34.321 --> 43:36.573
not working too well for us
right now.

43:37.449 --> 43:39.326
So not voting for Wyman
makes me

43:39.409 --> 43:40.744
a racist and a hypocrite?

43:40.827 --> 43:42.704
If the tiny glove fits...

43:44.331 --> 43:45.540
We got to go
pretty soon, baby.

43:45.624 --> 43:46.875
Bye, Fi.

43:49.377 --> 43:51.796
You're drinking a beer
in the middle of the day.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.340
It might be a clue
as to whether you're making

43:53.423 --> 43:55.300
the right decision or not.

43:58.595 --> 44:00.096

You know, he's probably
gonna wreck that bike

44:40.428 --> 44:41.554
within a week.

44:41.638 --> 44:43.306
Yeah.

44:43.807 --> 44:44.808
You may even get a chance

44:44.891 --> 44:46.935
to rebuild it again
if he lives.

45:01.741 --> 45:03.952
Hey, Frank.
What the fuck is going on here?

45:04.035 --> 45:05.578
What?

45:12.585 --> 45:15.505
Who are these ninja
motherfuckers?

45:21.094 --> 45:24.431
Shit.
Are those women?

45:26.766 --> 45:30.019
Fuck you!

45:39.195 --> 45:41.114
You did this?

45:46.077 --> 45:47.495
Hey!

46:14.856 --> 46:16.441
Hey.

46:19.152 --> 46:20.445
Hi.

46:22.572 --> 46:23.782
Did I do something wrong?

46:27.494 --> 46:29.996
- I can't do this again.
- Do what?

46:30.079 --> 46:31.539
It's just--
it's too many triggers,

46:31.623 --> 46:33.625
- and it just--
- Triggers?

46:33.708 --> 46:36.461
Falling in love with a straight
girl, it's too painful.

46:36.544 --> 46:39.130
Oh, Alex, I'm gay.

46:39.214 --> 46:41.216
You've been gay what, two days?

46:43.384 --> 46:45.261
I always do this.
I always do this.

46:45.345 --> 46:47.847
I promised myself
I wouldn't do it again, and...

46:48.807 --> 46:50.141
What--what if I am gay?

46:50.600 --> 46:52.060
See, you're not even sure.

46:52.143 --> 46:53.394
You don't know
if you're in love with me

46:53.478 --> 46:54.896
or you just hate men.

46:55.396 --> 46:57.482
Can't I be in love with you
and hate men, too?

46:59.067 --> 47:00.276
Please go.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.694
Just go.

47:23.007 --> 47:24.717
You choose.

47:36.145 --> 47:38.398
We count off 20 paces,
turn, and shoot.

47:38.481 --> 47:40.191
Okay.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.655
Uh, back to back.

47:45.738 --> 47:47.031
Saw it in a movie.

47:52.120 --> 47:55.290
One, two, three, four,

47:55.373 --> 47:58.501
five, six, seven, eight,

47:58.585 --> 48:00.003

48:00.086 --> 48:01.629

48:01.713 --> 48:04.883
13, 14, 15, 16,

48:04.966 --> 48:07.844
17, 18, 19, 20.

48:24.986 --> 48:26.905
What the hell
did you do that for?

48:26.988 --> 48:29.157
I don't want
to go to West Point!

48:29.240 --> 48:31.534
- Fucking kid--
- It's my dad!

48:33.202 --> 48:35.204
I want to go to Sarah Lawrence
and be a poet.

48:35.288 --> 48:37.248
What?

48:37.332 --> 48:39.250
Hey, hey, hey...

48:39.334 --> 48:40.585
Oh, I'm a--I'm a cripple now.

48:40.668 --> 48:42.086
I don't have
to go into the military.

48:42.170 --> 48:43.922
Yeah, I don't know
if it works like that.

48:44.005 --> 48:46.090
It's a flesh wound.
Probably heal up pretty quick.

48:48.551 --> 48:50.053
Shit!

48:50.136 --> 48:51.596
Shit!
Shoot me.

48:52.055 --> 48:54.724
- What?
- Yeah, through the bone.

48:54.807 --> 48:56.768
All right, I'll have a limp.
Great poets have limps.

48:56.851 --> 48:58.686
No fucking way.

48:58.770 --> 49:02.398
"I wander,
lonely as a cloud

49:02.482 --> 49:04.609
that floats on high
o'er vale and hills,

49:04.692 --> 49:05.777
when all at once,

49:05.860 --> 49:07.654
I see a crowd, a host,

49:07.737 --> 49:09.238
of golden daffodils..."

49:09.322 --> 49:11.532
Jesus, knock off
that golden daffodils shit.

49:11.616 --> 49:13.493
"Besides the lake
beneath the trees,

49:13.576 --> 49:15.703
fluttering, dancing
in the breeze,

49:15.787 --> 49:17.330
continuous as the stars

49:17.413 --> 49:19.332
that shine and twinkle
in the"--

49:19.415 --> 49:21.084
Oh!

49:21.167 --> 49:22.335
Fuck!

49:22.418 --> 49:24.253
Fuck!
Thank you.

49:26.339 --> 49:28.841
Ah! Oh! Ah!
Oh, one was enough.

49:28.925 --> 49:30.843
I'm good.

49:35.014 --> 49:36.265
Ah, hey.

49:36.349 --> 49:38.101
Hey, thanks, man.

49:38.184 --> 49:40.061
Dude, kill it
at West Point!

49:54.951 --> 49:56.244
What happened to your hand?

49:57.328 --> 50:01.165
I was in a riot
outside an elementary school.

50:01.249 --> 50:03.292
A riot?

50:03.376 --> 50:05.545
It was Frank.
Don't ask.

50:13.678 --> 50:15.430
I voted for Wyman.

50:18.558 --> 50:19.934
Good.

50:20.935 --> 50:23.855
So I'm not a traitor
to my class.

50:23.938 --> 50:24.939
No, I never said
that you were.

50:25.023 --> 50:27.692
You thought so.

50:35.950 --> 50:37.160
What's going on?

50:37.243 --> 50:38.578
I'm moving back home.

50:38.661 --> 50:39.704
You moved out?

50:39.787 --> 50:41.706
Alex and I broke up.

50:42.832 --> 50:44.042
Who's Alex?

50:44.125 --> 50:45.460
Shut up, Lip!

50:45.543 --> 50:46.669
Shut up!

50:55.344 --> 50:57.013
Hey, um, are you gonna
be all right hanging here

50:57.096 --> 50:58.598
if I have to go out
for a while?

50:58.681 --> 51:00.349
Where are you going?

51:00.433 --> 51:02.477
I'll be back, all right?
Just do your homework.

51:05.646 --> 51:08.566
Those hairy-armpit Rastas
are tougher than they look.

51:11.235 --> 51:14.489
Hey.
Fought the good fight, Mo.

51:14.572 --> 51:15.907
You got nothing
to be ashamed of.

51:20.953 --> 51:22.455
<i>In a shocking development</i>

51:22.538 --> 51:24.457

51:26.292 --> 51:29.087

51:29.170 --> 51:31.839
- Holy shit, Mo.
<i>- ...collecting just over 52%</i>

51:31.923 --> 51:33.341
<i>of the votes cast.</i>

51:33.424 --> 51:35.218
- Mo White...

51:35.301 --> 51:37.011
<i>Pollsters admit that
estimates were likely skewed</i>

51:37.095 --> 51:39.138
<i>due to the reluctance

51:39.222 --> 51:41.682
<i>to admit
they're actually bigots.</i>

51:41.766 --> 51:44.519
You're a congressman again.
What are you gonna do?

51:44.602 --> 51:46.562
- Mo White!
- Huh.

51:46.646 --> 51:49.065
- Mo White! Mo White!
- Absolutely nothing.

51:49.148 --> 51:51.275
That's the beauty
of being in Congress.

51:51.359 --> 51:53.444
You don't have to do
a goddamn thing.

51:54.612 --> 51:55.947
<i>We're waiting for reactions</i>

51:56.030 --> 51:57.198
<i>from the Wyman and Ruiz camps,</i>

51:57.281 --> 51:59.909

only 20--</i>

52:15.842 --> 52:17.135
What the fuck do you want?

52:18.469 --> 52:20.054
Ten grand.

52:27.603 --> 52:29.272
I give you ten grand,

52:29.355 --> 52:31.357
and you agree
to stay away from Xan.

52:32.316 --> 52:34.360
You have to sign some papers.

52:41.534 --> 52:43.161
What kind of papers?

52:44.495 --> 52:46.831
You'd relinquish
your parental rights...

52:48.541 --> 52:50.668
and make me
Xan's legal guardian.

52:57.466 --> 52:59.093
Ten grand.

53:01.721 --> 53:03.347
Take it or leave it.

53:09.979 --> 53:11.731
Can I see the papers?

53:20.781 --> 53:22.992
You'd have to sign it
in front of a notary...

53:23.868 --> 53:25.244
to make it legal.

53:26.245 --> 53:27.747
We can go in the morning.

53:30.625 --> 53:32.418
Mom?

53:37.298 --> 53:40.176
I knew you'd come back
for me!

53:44.013 --> 53:46.265
It's so good
