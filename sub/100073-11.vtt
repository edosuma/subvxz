Nolan:
I have some bad news.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.040
Caleb failed.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.080
Yeah.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.670
We saved
Armstrong and Lucy,

41:13.670 --> 41:16.250
and Caleb is very dead.

41:16.250 --> 41:18.040
That is disappointing.

41:18.040 --> 41:21.250
And now it is
truly finished.

41:21.250 --> 41:23.880
No, I never showed you
where the third burial site is.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.580
And there are others.

41:25.580 --> 41:27.120
I can make a new deal.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.420
Sorry.

41:29.420 --> 41:30.880

everything you told him.

Every kill.

You have no more secrets.

41:42.620 --> 41:46.580
So there's no more deals,
no more creepy hikes.

41:46.580 --> 41:48.040

I don't care.

42:03.330 --> 42:04.380
You will.

42:04.380 --> 42:06.170
It's about Armstrong.
