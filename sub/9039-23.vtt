00:03.367 --> 00:04.500
- HI, DADDY.
- HI, DADDY.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.767
- HEY, HI.
- HI, DAD.

00:05.767 --> 00:07.167
- MORNING.

00:07.167 --> 00:09.600
- HEY.
- HEY.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.467
YOU KNOW, I HAD A DREAM

00:10.467 --> 00:12.667
THAT YOU MADE ME PANCAKES

00:12.667 --> 00:14.100
AND BACON AND EGGS
FOR BREAKFAST.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.600
- WAKE UP.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.333
- HELLO, FAMILY.

00:22.333 --> 00:25.833
- OOH, HELLO, OFFICER BARONE.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.733
DON'T YOU LOOK HANDSOME.

00:27.733 --> 00:28.833
- WHY, THANK YOU.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.367
I JUST THOUGHT I'D STOP BY

00:30.367 --> 00:32.767
TO INVITE YOU BOTH TO BE
MY GUESTS FOR DINNER TONIGHT

00:32.767 --> 00:35.400
TO HELP ME CELEBRATE
MY FIRST DAY BACK ON THE JOB.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.300
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.
WE WOULD LOVE THAT.

00:37.300 --> 00:41.767
- AND AMY WILL BE JOINING US.

00:41.767 --> 00:42.800
- WHAT?

00:42.800 --> 00:43.800
- AMY?

00:43.800 --> 00:45.067
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

00:45.067 --> 00:47.800
- SHE CALLED ME.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.800
ALLEGEDLY TO ASK
FOR HER PINK SWEATER BACK.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.400
[chuckles]

00:52.400 --> 00:53.800
- YOU CAN'T GIVE THAT BACK.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.567
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA WEAR
WITH YOUR BLUE SKIRT?

01:00.267 --> 01:01.767
- SO THIS IS
VERY EXCITING, HUH?

01:02.133 --> 01:03.367
- YUP.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.833
BACK WITH AMY,
GOING BACK TO WORK,

01:04.833 --> 01:06.367
LIVING IN MY OWN PLACE AGAIN.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.300
I'LL TELL YOU, THINGS ARE
REALLY MOVING FORWARD.

01:08.300 --> 01:12.400
- TO WHERE THEY WERE
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.067
- VERY HAPPY FOR YOU,
ROBERT.

01:14.067 --> 01:17.200
- AH, THANK YOU.

01:20.700 --> 01:24.567
- YEAH. FORGET IT.
I'M NOT KISSING YOU.

01:24.567 --> 01:26.100
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, CUBBY?
- YEAH.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.733
- COME ON.

01:27.733 --> 01:28.867
GIVE ME A LITTLE SUGAR.

01:28.867 --> 01:30.200
- GET LOST.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.500
GET OUTTA HERE.
GET OUT.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.533
HEY, NO!

01:40.067 --> 01:42.333
- YOU LOVE IT.
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE IT!

01:42.333 --> 01:43.867
- HEY, SCREW YOU!

01:43.867 --> 01:48.200
- IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.467
- YEAH.

01:53.467 --> 01:54.667
- [laughing]

01:54.667 --> 01:55.933
- HE THINKS
BECAUSE HE BUYS ME DINNER,

02:01.100 --> 02:02.067
- THIS IS GREAT CAKE.

02:02.933 --> 02:04.633
YOU GUYS
DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

02:04.633 --> 02:07.633
- WELL, PARTNER, WE WANTED
TO WELCOME YOU BACK RIGHT.

02:07.633 --> 02:11.667
BESIDES, I LIKE CAKE.

02:11.667 --> 02:14.067
- BEST BUNCH OF GUYS
IN THE WORLD.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.733
- OH, EVERYBODY MISSED YOU.

02:15.733 --> 02:18.000
GIVE ME SOME FROSTING.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.867
both: MMM.

02:19.867 --> 02:21.600
- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.133
- YOU KNOW, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE SOMEBODY

02:23.133 --> 02:25.200
ENJOYING THEIR FOOD
FOR A CHANGE.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.367
FOUR MONTHS
WITH OFFICER DOYLE.

02:27.367 --> 02:28.933
- WHAT?
HE'S A GOOD COP.

02:28.933 --> 02:30.567
- ALL HE ATE
WAS PROTEIN BARS.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.567
I TRIED
A PEANUT BUTTER ONE ONCE.

02:32.567 --> 02:36.167
TASTED LIKE FEET.

02:36.167 --> 02:39.733
- HEY, IF YOU SEE A FLOWER SHOP,
LET'S PULL IN.

02:39.733 --> 02:42.900
- OH, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.333
- NO, NO.

02:44.333 --> 02:46.500
I'M TAKING AMY OUT
TO CELEBRATE TONIGHT.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.700
- AMY?

02:47.700 --> 02:49.233
AFTER ALL THE TIMES
YOU BOUNCED HER AROUND,

02:49.233 --> 02:51.600
SHE'S STILL COMING BACK
FOR MORE?

02:51.600 --> 02:53.167
- IT'S VERY HARD
FOR A WOMAN

02:53.167 --> 02:57.033
TO RESIST THE CHARMS
OF OFFICER LOVE.

02:57.033 --> 02:59.033
[radio beeps]
- 2-3 SERGEANT.

02:59.033 --> 03:01.167
- 2-3 SERGEANT.

03:01.167 --> 03:03.267
- INVESTIGATE 1010,
DISORDERLY YOUTHS

03:03.267 --> 03:06.633
AT WAZIR'S CANDY STORE,
22 SOUTH MCDONNELL DRIVE.

03:06.633 --> 03:07.767
SEE THE COMPLAINANT.

03:07.767 --> 03:11.600
- WE COPY, 10-4.
WAZIR'S CANDY STORE.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.967
- OH, DISORDERLY YOUTHS.
THAT'S ALL?

03:13.967 --> 03:15.467
I WAS HOPING
YOUR FIRST DAY BACK

03:15.467 --> 03:18.300
WE'D HAVE A HOMICIDE.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.467
- OH, THAT'S SWEET.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.600
THOUGH, HEY,
IT'S STILL EARLY YET, RIGHT?

03:26.567 --> 03:27.967
- FINALLY.

03:27.967 --> 03:29.567
THANK GOODNESS
YOU'VE COME.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.900
- I'M OFFICER ROSEMOND,
AND THIS IS SERGEANT BARONE.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.200
WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE TROUBLE?

03:33.200 --> 03:34.300
- YOU SEE THOSE KIDS
OVER THERE?

03:34.300 --> 03:36.400
ONE OF THEM
STOLE SOMETHING.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.233
- WELL, DID YOU SEE IT?
- YES.

03:38.233 --> 03:39.467
THEY WERE FOOLING AROUND,

03:39.467 --> 03:40.933
AND THAT ONE
IN THE GREEN COAT,

03:40.933 --> 03:43.767
HE TOOK SOMETHING
AND PUT IT IN HIS PASH-PASH.

03:45.967 --> 03:48.733
- IN HIS PASH-PASH.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.667
- I THINK
THAT'S HIS POCKET.

03:50.667 --> 03:53.867
- YES, IN HIS PASH-PASH.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.467
- OKAY, LOOK,
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A STATEMENT,

03:55.467 --> 03:56.933
AND I'LL GO TALK
TO THE KID?

03:56.933 --> 03:59.133
- SURE, SARGE.

03:59.133 --> 04:01.800
[bells dinging]

04:01.800 --> 04:03.300
- EXCUSE ME.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.367
EXCUSE ME.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.333
- HEY.
I WAS PLAYING THAT.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.633
- I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU
A COUPLE QUESTIONS,

04:20.633 --> 04:23.033
AND I WOULD APPRECIATE
YOUR FULL ATTENTION.

04:23.033 --> 04:24.133
- WHAT DID I DO?

04:24.133 --> 04:27.600
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW YET.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.967
NICE JACKET.

04:28.967 --> 04:31.367
KIND OF WARM
FOR TODAY, THOUGH.

04:31.367 --> 04:32.967
- WHAT ARE YOU,
THE FASHION POLICE?

04:32.967 --> 04:36.100
[laughter]

04:38.233 --> 04:41.367
[bells dinging]

04:45.100 --> 04:46.700
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

04:46.700 --> 04:49.900
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE--TAKE IT EASY.
JUST BACK OFF.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.367
- TAKE IT--
YOU BACK OFF, MAN!

04:52.367 --> 04:53.367
- JUDY?

04:53.367 --> 04:54.967
- WHY ARE YOU HASSLING ME?

04:54.967 --> 04:56.100
- JUDY, COULD YOU
GET OVER HERE?

04:56.100 --> 04:57.267
- [groans]

04:57.267 --> 04:58.333
- IN A SECOND, SARGE.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.367
- GET OVER HERE NOW.

05:01.833 --> 05:03.100
- WHAT'S WRONG?

05:03.100 --> 05:06.200
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.600
- HE'S A FREAK!

05:07.600 --> 05:09.267
- WAS I TALKING TO YOU?

05:09.267 --> 05:14.333
HERE. SIT.
NOW REST YOUR MOUTH!

05:14.333 --> 05:16.933
I CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS.
YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

05:16.933 --> 05:20.400
- I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS SO.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.667
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO WAIT
IN THE CAR?

05:21.667 --> 05:24.167
I'LL BRING YOU
SOME GOOBERS.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.333
- MARIE,
IF THE KIDS COME DOWN,

05:34.333 --> 05:35.767
DON'T GIVE THEM
ANY CANDY NOW,

05:35.767 --> 05:37.500
'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T EAT
THEIR DINNER.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.733
- I SAW THE MEAT LOAF PAN
IN THE SINK.

05:39.733 --> 05:43.067
I'M SURE THEY DID
THE BEST THEY COULD.

05:45.133 --> 05:46.467
[doorbell rings]

05:46.467 --> 05:48.100
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

05:48.100 --> 05:49.967
- DOORBELL.

05:49.967 --> 05:53.600
- YOU ALWAYS HAD THAT?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.733
- AMY.
- HI.

05:55.733 --> 05:57.133
LOOK AT YOU.

05:57.133 --> 05:59.800
- HI, AMY.
- MARIE.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.133
- OHH, DARLING.
- HI.

06:02.133 --> 06:04.233
- BOY.
- IS ROBERT HERE YET?

06:04.233 --> 06:06.833
- NO, HE'S NOT HERE YET.
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC!

06:06.833 --> 06:09.800
LOOK AT THOSE SHOES.
THAT'S VERY SEXY.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.367
- THEY'RE KILLING ME.

06:12.367 --> 06:16.567
BUT SEE HOW TINY
MY FEET LOOK?

06:16.567 --> 06:19.467
- WHERE YOU BEEN?
LET'S GO.

06:19.467 --> 06:25.167
- HI, ROBERT.
OW, OW, OW, OW.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.133
HOW WAS
YOUR FIRST DAY BACK?

06:27.133 --> 06:30.033
- IT WAS OKAY.

06:30.033 --> 06:32.267
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WEARING
TO DINNER, ROBERT?

06:32.267 --> 06:33.700
- YEAH,
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

06:33.700 --> 06:36.867
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE
GOING OUT TONIGHT.

06:36.867 --> 06:37.767
- WHY?
WHAT'S WRONG?

06:37.767 --> 06:39.433
- NOTHING.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.300
A PERSON DOESN'T WANT TO EAT,
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO EAT.

06:41.300 --> 06:45.567
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

06:45.567 --> 06:48.233
- BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA CELEBRATE TONIGHT.

06:48.233 --> 06:51.333
I BOUGHT
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SHOES.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.100
- YOU KNOW,
I REALLY DON'T NEED

06:53.100 --> 06:54.533
THIS KIND OF PRESSURE
RIGHT NOW.

06:54.533 --> 06:56.800
- ROBERT,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

06:56.800 --> 07:00.133
- NOTHING! NOTHING!
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

07:03.500 --> 07:04.833
- FINE.

07:04.833 --> 07:08.633
DON'T WANT TO GO OUT?
I UNDERSTAND.

07:08.633 --> 07:12.333
WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS
HOW I CAN BE SUCH AN IDIOT!

07:12.333 --> 07:15.167
OW.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.567
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.

07:17.567 --> 07:21.200
I'M RETURNING THESE DAMN SHOES.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.300
- ROBERT.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.100
- WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE SCREAMING?

07:25.100 --> 07:28.200
YOU GUYS AREN'T
EVEN MARRIED YET.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.067
- I DIDN'T SCREAM AT HER,
ALL RIGHT?

07:30.067 --> 07:31.300
- WELL, YOU WEREN'T NICE.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.633
- JUST SHUT UP, RAYMOND.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.933
- WE DON'T SAY
"SHUT UP," ROBERT.

07:34.933 --> 07:36.333
- WELL, THEN,
BE QUIET, MA.

07:36.333 --> 07:39.433
- OH, NOW,
JUST ONE MINUTE, MISTER.

07:39.433 --> 07:41.967
YOU DO NOT COME
INTO MY HOUSE--

07:41.967 --> 07:44.167
- OUR HOUSE.
- FINE.

07:44.167 --> 07:47.033
OUR HOUSE.

07:47.033 --> 07:48.367
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:48.367 --> 07:50.667
DID YOU HAVE A BAD DAY
AT WORK TODAY?

07:50.667 --> 07:52.167
- YOU COULD SAY THAT.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.267
- WELL, I HOPE
IT GOES BETTER TOMORROW,

07:53.267 --> 07:54.900
BUT THIS IS NO EXCUSE--

07:54.900 --> 07:57.600
- IT'S GONNA GO BETTER, MA,
BECAUSE I QUIT THE FORCE.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.500
- WELL, I GUESS
WE'RE NOT GOING OUT.

08:12.067 --> 08:14.000
[sighs]

08:14.000 --> 08:15.667
MEAT LOAF.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.033
- WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU MEAN, YOU QUIT?

08:27.033 --> 08:28.300
- I QUIT.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.100
I'M NOT
A POLICE OFFICER ANYMORE.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.433
- OH, COME ON.
YOU DIDN'T QUIT.

08:31.433 --> 08:33.200
- I TOLD MY SQUAD
THIS AFTERNOON.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.733
- BUT, ROBERT, YOU WERE
SO EXCITED ABOUT GOING BACK.

08:35.733 --> 08:37.533
- I CHANGED MY MIND.

08:37.533 --> 08:42.000
- WHAT HAPPENED?
DID YOU SKIP LUNCH?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.133
YOU KNOW
HOW CRANKY YOU GET.

08:45.133 --> 08:48.433
- THAT WASN'T IT, MA.

08:48.433 --> 08:50.700
JUDY AND I WENT
INTO THIS CANDY STORE--

08:50.700 --> 08:54.000
- CANDY IS NOT A MEAL.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.300
- MOM.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.967
WHAT--WELL,
WHAT HAPPENED, ROBERT?

08:56.967 --> 09:01.700
- I HAD A CONFRONTATION WITH
SOME PUNK IN THE CANDY STORE,

09:01.700 --> 09:02.867
AND I DON'T KNOW.

09:02.867 --> 09:06.067
I JUST--I GOT SCARED.

09:06.067 --> 09:09.267
I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW,
WHAT IF HIS FRIENDS JUMP ME?

09:09.267 --> 09:11.467
WHAT IF HE HAS A GUN?

09:11.467 --> 09:15.567
I FROZE.
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

09:15.567 --> 09:19.667
- IS THIS GONNA BE
IN THE PAPERS?

09:19.667 --> 09:21.233
'CAUSE I'M JUST STARTING
TO LIVE DOWN

09:21.233 --> 09:24.367
THE BULL
IN THE ASS THING.

09:30.433 --> 09:35.700
- NO, DAD, BUT THANKS
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.467
- YOU KNOW, ROBERT,
THAT WAS YOUR FIRST DAY BACK.

09:37.467 --> 09:40.067
YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOURSELF
A CHANCE TO ADJUST.

09:40.067 --> 09:42.733
- YOU CAN'T ADJUST
TO TERROR.

09:42.733 --> 09:45.167
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S OUT THERE.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.367
I DIDN'T KNOW A BULL
WAS GONNA COME

09:46.367 --> 09:49.367
AROUND THE CORNER AT ME.

09:49.367 --> 09:52.500
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE KID HAD
IN HIS PASH-PASH.

09:56.167 --> 09:57.933
I'M NOT GOING BACK.

09:57.933 --> 10:00.433
- PASH-PASH?

10:00.433 --> 10:03.133
- I KNOW WHAT WILL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER, ROBBIE.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.700
COME OVER.
I HAVE SOME LAMB CHOPS.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.233
- OH, YUM.

10:07.233 --> 10:11.067
BET THAT COMES WITH A BIG SIDE
OF ROOM AND BOARD.

10:13.267 --> 10:14.700
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

10:14.700 --> 10:17.900
- YOU GOT NO JOB.
YOU CAN'T PAY YOUR RENT.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.600
HERE'S ROBBIE!

10:20.600 --> 10:22.133
- I'LL GET
ANOTHER JOB, OKAY?

10:22.133 --> 10:24.033
THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS
I CAN DO.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.567
- YEAH, RIGHT.

10:25.567 --> 10:27.833
- FRANK.
- DON'T "FRANK" ME.

10:27.833 --> 10:29.933
I'M THE ONE WHO'S GONNA BE
SHELLING OUT FOR HIS FEED

10:29.933 --> 10:32.433
FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS...

10:32.433 --> 10:35.567
OR HOWEVER LONG
GIANTS LIVE NOWADAYS.

10:42.967 --> 10:45.300
- ROBBIE.
I'LL HELP YOU, DEAR.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.767
HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING
OF ANYTHING ELSE

10:46.767 --> 10:48.267
YOU'D LIKE TO DO, DEAR?

10:48.267 --> 10:52.667
- I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GETTING INTO TELEMARKETING.

10:52.667 --> 10:55.600
- OH, GOD, NO.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.333
- A FRIEND OF MINE DOES
VERY WELL

10:57.333 --> 11:01.300
SELLING EXTENDED APPLIANCE
WARRANTIES OVER THE PHONE.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.533
- TELEMARKETING?
YOU THINK PEOPLE HATE COPS.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.633
- ROBERT, LISTEN.
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

11:11.633 --> 11:14.633
YOU'VE ALWAYS TOLD ME HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE PROTECTING THE PUBLIC.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.233
- I'LL STILL BE PROTECTING
THE PUBLIC

11:16.233 --> 11:19.300
FROM FAULTY APPLIANCES.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.433
LISTEN, LOOK.
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

11:21.433 --> 11:23.933
ON A GOOD WEEK,
I CAN MAKE THE SAME PAY

11:23.933 --> 11:25.033
AS I WOULD ON THE FORCE.

11:25.033 --> 11:26.467
AND AS A TELEMARKETER,

11:26.467 --> 11:28.167
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO LEAVE MY APARTMENT.

11:28.167 --> 11:31.733
- OR BATHE.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.233
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
FORGET IT, OKAY?

11:35.233 --> 11:37.000
WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER
TALKING TO YOU PEOPLE?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.533
- ROBERT, COME ON.

11:38.533 --> 11:41.033
YOU REALLY WANT TO LEAVE
YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR PARTNER

11:41.033 --> 11:42.700
AND THE JOB YOU'VE HAD
YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

11:42.700 --> 11:45.167
- DON'T YOU GET IT?
I FROZE OUT THERE, MAN.

11:45.167 --> 11:46.533
- ALL RIGHT, ROBERT,
ROBERT, LISTEN.

11:46.533 --> 11:49.300
- NO, YOU LISTEN, OKAY?
YOU ALL LISTEN.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.000
I'M DONE BEING A COP.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.300
A DOOR CLOSES;
ANOTHER ONE OPENS.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.367
AND I'M GOING
THROUGH THAT DOOR.

11:59.367 --> 12:02.867
AND I'M SHUTTING IT
BEHIND ME.

12:02.867 --> 12:04.533
THE END.

12:07.133 --> 12:10.000
- OKAY, THIS IS AWFUL, RAY.
YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.567
- I KNOW.
TELEMARKETING.

12:11.567 --> 12:14.700
THE FIRST PEOPLE THOSE GUYS CALL
ARE THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.

12:18.233 --> 12:21.400
- YOU KNOW, HE NEEDS TO TALK
TO SOMEBODY ABOUT THIS.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.600
- LIKE WHO?
A SHRINK?

12:23.600 --> 12:25.567
- WELL, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

12:25.567 --> 12:27.167
- EXCUSE ME,
BUT THEY DON'T HELP.

12:27.167 --> 12:30.900
THEY JUST BLAME
THE MOTHER.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.267
- YEAH, THAT CAN'T BE IT.

12:35.967 --> 12:38.267
- NO, THEY DON'T
BLAME ANYBODY.

12:38.267 --> 12:40.333
THEY JUST HELP YOU
SORT THINGS OUT.

12:40.333 --> 12:41.600
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.067
- WELL, BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN TO ONE.

12:43.067 --> 12:45.333
- REALLY?

12:45.333 --> 12:49.900
- WHY WOULD YOU
TELL HER THAT?

12:49.900 --> 12:52.067
- WHAT?
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.

12:52.067 --> 12:55.367
- DID YOU KNOW THIS
BEFORE YOU GOT MARRIED?

12:55.367 --> 12:59.133
- HEY, A GIRL GOES OUT WITH ME,
I DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

13:01.467 --> 13:03.500
- ROBERT'S SCARED,
YOU KNOW?

13:03.500 --> 13:05.967
HE NEEDS TO GET SOME HELP.
HE'S GOT TO FACE HIS FEARS.

13:05.967 --> 13:08.200
IF HE DOESN'T,
HE'S NOT GONNA GET ANY BETTER.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.333
- ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH.
"FACE HIS FEARS."

13:11.333 --> 13:14.200
SO HE GOT A LITTLE SCARED.
SO WHAT?

13:14.200 --> 13:16.133
YOU THINK I WASN'T SCARED
IN KOREA?

13:16.133 --> 13:17.767
- OH, GOD.

13:17.767 --> 13:21.467
- WE WERE ALL SCARED.
WE DIDN'T HAVE SHRINKS.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.767
YOU KNOW WHAT SNAPPED US
OUT OF IT?

13:23.767 --> 13:26.700
50,000 SCREAMING CHINAMEN.

13:33.833 --> 13:36.067
- WELL, DAD, WHERE'S ROBERT
GONNA GET HIS HANDS

13:36.067 --> 13:39.200
ON 50,000 SCREAMING CHINAMEN?

13:48.100 --> 13:49.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:49.300 --> 13:50.667
I THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING TO LUNCH.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.333
- YEAH, I KNOW.
WE'RE GOING FOR LUNCH.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.633
I JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
WE'D TAKE A WALK.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.900
- WALK.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.467
- WHAT? IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.700
TWO BROTHERS CAN'T GO
FOR A WALK

13:58.700 --> 14:00.233
ON A BEAUTIFUL
SUNDAY AFTERNOON?

14:00.233 --> 14:01.633
- OH, SO THIS IS
A REGULAR THING NOW?

14:01.633 --> 14:03.367
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
EVERY 40 YEARS?

14:03.367 --> 14:05.567
- IF YOU WANT, YEAH.

14:05.567 --> 14:06.767
COME ON, MAN.

14:08.433 --> 14:09.867
HOW'S IT GOING?
- GOOD.

14:09.867 --> 14:11.200
LET ME ASK YOU, RAYMOND.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.833
IS YOUR LETTUCE WILTING
BEFORE IT SHOULD?

14:13.833 --> 14:15.033
- WHAT?

14:15.033 --> 14:16.433
- HOW ABOUT
YOUR DAIRY PRODUCTS?

14:16.433 --> 14:17.967
DO YOU FIND YOURSELF
THROWING AWAY THE MILK

14:17.967 --> 14:19.467
BEFORE THE EXPIRATION DATE?

14:19.467 --> 14:21.333
- OUR REFRIGERATOR'S FINE,
ROBERT, OKAY?

14:21.333 --> 14:23.767
WE DON'T NEED ANY OF
YOUR DAMN APPLIANCE INSURANCE.

14:23.767 --> 14:26.567
- ALL RIGHT, THEN PERHAPS
I SHOULD TALK TO THE MISSUS?

14:26.567 --> 14:28.400
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW STUPID YOU SOUND?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.167
- NOW LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING HERE.

14:30.167 --> 14:31.967
IF THIS WAS OVER THE PHONE,
YOU'D BE BEGGING ME FOR THIS.

14:31.967 --> 14:34.367
- YUP.
- BY THE WAY, HOW IS YOUR PHONE?

14:34.367 --> 14:35.433
- YOU GUYS COVER THAT?

14:35.433 --> 14:36.933
- AH.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:36.933 --> 14:38.467
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

14:38.467 --> 14:41.633
COME ON, LOOK, I BROUGHT YOU
OUT HERE FOR A REASON.

14:41.633 --> 14:43.533
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU
AFTER YOU LEFT.

14:43.533 --> 14:45.167
- YEAH, YOU MEAN
LAUGHING ABOUT ME.

14:45.167 --> 14:47.233
- NO, NOT AS MUCH
AS YOU THINK.

14:47.233 --> 14:49.433
DEBRA SAID SOMETHING
THAT KIND OF MADE SENSE.

14:49.433 --> 14:52.333
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
GET BETTER UNTIL YOU,

14:52.333 --> 14:53.733
YOU KNOW,
FACE YOUR FEARS.

14:53.733 --> 14:55.467
- WHO SAYS I'VE GOT
TO GET BETTER?

14:55.467 --> 14:58.667
- WELL, I DO,
AND MOM AND DAD AND DEBRA

14:58.667 --> 15:00.733
AND ANYONE ELSE WHO GETS
ONE OF YOUR PHONE CALLS

15:00.733 --> 15:02.133
ABOUT THEIR HUMIDIFIER.

15:02.133 --> 15:03.400
- HUMIDIFIERS,
LEFT UNATTENDED,

15:03.400 --> 15:05.067
ARE VIRTUAL
BREEDING GROUNDS--

15:05.067 --> 15:06.267
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
ENOUGH.

15:06.267 --> 15:07.467
WE'RE HERE.

15:07.467 --> 15:09.800
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WE'RE HERE?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.833
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

15:11.833 --> 15:13.000
[chickens clucking]

15:13.000 --> 15:14.400
- HEY, I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.533
- FUZZY ACRES PETTING ZOO?

15:16.533 --> 15:18.433
- YOU'RE GONNA FACE
YOUR FEARS.

15:18.433 --> 15:22.367
- I DON'T HAVE
A FEAR OF MANURE.

15:22.367 --> 15:23.600
- YEAH.
THERE IT IS.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.567
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S HIM.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.100
- NO, NO, NO.
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.333
- WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

15:28.333 --> 15:30.033
- JUDY AND I DID
SOME RESEARCH.

15:30.033 --> 15:31.700
AFTER YOU BUSTED UP
THAT RODEO,

15:31.700 --> 15:34.833
YOUR BULL GOT SENTENCED
TO COMMUNITY SERVICE HERE.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.167
WANT TO GO SEE HIM?

15:36.167 --> 15:37.867
- NO, I DON'T WANT
TO GO SEE HIM.

15:37.867 --> 15:39.467
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?

15:39.467 --> 15:40.800
YOU SAW WHAT HE DID TO ME.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.800
- I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE A LITTLE NERVOUS.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.667
WANT TO WORK YOUR WAY UP?

15:44.667 --> 15:46.533
START WITH A DUCK.

15:46.533 --> 15:49.767
- THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
FUNNY ABOUT THIS, RAYMOND.

15:49.767 --> 15:51.567
- LISTEN TO ME.

15:51.567 --> 15:53.467
I WOULDN'T DO THIS IF I DIDN'T
THINK IT WAS GOOD FOR YOU.

15:53.467 --> 15:58.200
I JUST WANT YOU TO SEE THAT
HE'S NOT A MONSTER, YOU KNOW?

15:58.200 --> 15:59.800
THE DAY
YOU TWO GUYS MET,

15:59.800 --> 16:01.500
HE WAS PROBABLY
ALL FREAKED OUT.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.567
HE WAS PROBABLY MORE SCARED
THAN YOU WERE.

16:03.567 --> 16:04.667
NOW LOOK AT HIM.

16:04.667 --> 16:09.600
HE'S JUST NESTOR,
THE HAPPY BULL.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.200
- WELL, I'M GLAD
HE'S HAPPY.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.567
HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO HELP ME?

16:12.567 --> 16:14.467
- COME ON,
JUST GO LOOK AT HIM.

16:14.467 --> 16:15.667
YOU WERE A COP.

16:15.667 --> 16:19.467
YOU TOLD ME ONCE
ABOUT THAT VICTIM THERAPY STUFF.

16:19.467 --> 16:21.600
SO GO AHEAD.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.533
CONFRONT YOUR ATTACKER.

16:27.367 --> 16:28.700
- I DON'T KNOW, RAYMOND.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.433
THIS FENCE DOESN'T LOOK
TOO STURDY.

16:31.433 --> 16:34.233
- WELL, HE SEEMS PRETTY MELLOW.

16:34.233 --> 16:37.000
TURN AROUND.
SEE IF HE RECOGNIZES YOU.

16:38.367 --> 16:41.167
GO AHEAD.
SHOW HIM YOUR FUZZY ACRES.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.667
- YOU GONNA MAKE JOKES?
- ALL RIGHT, SORRY.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.400
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?
- I'M SORRY.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.200
SORRY. GOOD.
I'LL JUST--I'LL BE UPWIND.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.067
- FUNNY MAN.

17:07.467 --> 17:08.733
HEY.

17:11.233 --> 17:13.100
REMEMBER ME?

17:15.367 --> 17:19.000
YOU RAN INTO ME
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.500
ACTUALLY, IT WAS MORE
THAN THAT.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.800
YOU GORED ME.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.800
YOU RAN AFTER ME,

17:27.800 --> 17:29.667
YOU CAUGHT UP WITH ME,

17:29.667 --> 17:31.967
AND YOU GORED ME...

17:31.967 --> 17:36.067
RIGHT IN THE ASS!

17:36.067 --> 17:37.633
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

17:37.633 --> 17:39.200
HUH? YOU DAMN BULL.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.900
- ROBERT, ROBERT.

17:40.900 --> 17:46.100
I KNOW WE'RE OUTSIDE,
BUT INSIDE VOICE.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.033
- ALL RIGHT.

17:50.567 --> 17:53.733
LOOK, YOU WERE PROBABLY
JUST GOING ON INSTINCT,

17:53.733 --> 17:57.167
BUT YOU REALLY SCREWED
THINGS UP FOR ME.

17:57.167 --> 17:59.100
I GOT FAMOUS
'CAUSE OF YOU.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.800
AND NOT THE GOOD KIND
OF FAMOUS.

18:00.800 --> 18:04.533
THE KIND OF FAMOUS WHERE PEOPLE
POINT AT YOUR BUTT AND LAUGH.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.500
I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.
THAT'S RIGHT.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.633
I HAD TO SIT
ON A SPECIAL PILLOW.

18:15.533 --> 18:17.367
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOUR PARENTS ARE RIGHT NOW,

18:17.367 --> 18:18.933
BUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE TO GO

18:18.933 --> 18:21.767
AND LIVE WITH THEM
FOR A WHILE?

18:25.633 --> 18:31.033
MY FATHER HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A VERY INSENSITIVE MAN.

18:31.033 --> 18:32.533
THEN MY MOTHER--

18:32.533 --> 18:34.133
WELL, THERE'S REALLY NOT
ENOUGH TIME FOR THAT.

18:34.133 --> 18:35.400
- HEY, ROBERT, ROBERT,
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY--

18:35.400 --> 18:38.533
- I WANT HIM TO KNOW.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.033
- HI, BULL.

19:04.867 --> 19:07.033
- THIS WAS THE ONE.

19:07.033 --> 19:09.233
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.700
IT FELT EVEN BIGGER.

19:17.467 --> 19:19.767
HEY, YOU HUNGRY?

19:19.767 --> 19:23.700
I KNOW IF I DON'T EAT,
I GET ALL CRANKY.

19:23.700 --> 19:26.533
OH, YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?

19:26.533 --> 19:29.767
GOOD...BULL.

19:44.033 --> 19:45.333
SO I WENT TO SEE
NESTOR THE BULL,

19:46.200 --> 19:47.900
YOU KNOW,
TO FACE MY FEARS,

19:47.900 --> 19:50.100
AND, UH,
THAT WENT PRETTY WELL.

19:50.100 --> 19:53.233
IN FACT, I'M BACK
ON THE FORCE AGAIN

19:53.233 --> 19:56.133
AND I'M FEELING
PRETTY GOOD.

19:56.133 --> 19:59.267
SO I THOUGHT
I'D COME HERE TO FACE YOU.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.700
NOT--NOT THAT
I'M AFRAID OF YOU,

20:04.700 --> 20:08.600
BUT I WOULD REALLY FEEL BETTER
IF YOU BLINKED.

20:11.800 --> 20:15.867
SEE, I--I WAS AFRAID OF US--

20:15.867 --> 20:17.633
YOU KNOW, COMMITMENT.

20:17.633 --> 20:22.733
AND, UH, WELL, IF--IF YOU FEEL
LIKE GIVING ME A SECOND CHANCE--

20:22.733 --> 20:25.067
OR ACTUALLY A FIFTH CHANCE--

20:25.067 --> 20:30.467
UM, THAT WOULD
REALLY MAKE ME HAPPY.

20:30.467 --> 20:31.733
OKAY?

20:48.667 --> 20:50.500
YOU HUNGRY?

21:00.367 --> 21:01.733
male announcer:
AND NOW A MESSAGE

21:01.733 --> 21:03.467
FROM YOUR LOCAL SAFETY COUNCIL.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.100

21:07.100 --> 21:08.567
I'M SERGEANT ROBERT BARONE

21:08.567 --> 21:10.833

21:10.833 --> 21:13.133
NOW, YOU MAY REMEMBER ME
AND MY FRIEND NESTOR HERE

21:13.133 --> 21:14.867
FROM THIS LITTLE VIDEO.

21:14.867 --> 21:17.000
THAT'S ME,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.700
AND THAT'S NESTOR.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.367
NOT A FUN DAY.

21:22.367 --> 21:25.533
REMEMBER, ALWAYS BE ALERT
WHEN CROSSING THE STREET.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.933
USE CROSSWALKS AND ALWAYS LOOK
IN BOTH DIRECTIONS

21:27.933 --> 21:31.400
FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC
BEFORE STEPPING OFF THE CURB.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.067
TAKE IT FROM ME
AND NESTOR.

21:33.067 --> 21:34.633
WHEN YOU'RE OUT
ON THE STREET,

21:34.633 --> 21:36.367
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

21:36.367 --> 21:38.467
AND THAT'S NO BULL.

21:38.467 --> 21:40.100
