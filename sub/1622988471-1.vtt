WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:04.860
(tense music)

01:16.947 --> 01:19.297
- Here we go guys, we'll
do it nice and smooth.

01:27.943 --> 01:30.920
Can I have the first wall, please.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.033
House lights on.

01:37.350 --> 01:40.070
First tree, we're gonna
put that on the mark.

01:40.070 --> 01:41.210
That one goes over there,

01:41.210 --> 01:42.958
you'll see the marking.

01:42.958 --> 01:45.458
(tense music)

02:07.579 --> 02:10.079
(tense music)

02:37.474 --> 02:39.160
(glass shattering)

02:39.160 --> 02:40.333
House lights on.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.690
Can I have the swords, one for Hamlet?

02:44.690 --> 02:45.692
Awesome.

02:45.692 --> 02:46.711
That's the one you practiced with, right?

02:46.711 --> 02:47.714
- Ah, yes, I think so.

02:47.714 --> 02:48.547
- The actors can come out.

02:48.547 --> 02:49.950
Ophelia, there she is.

02:49.950 --> 02:51.010
Oh, you look beautiful.

02:51.010 --> 02:51.843
I love this dress.

02:51.843 --> 02:53.100
I'm so glad we chose this one.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.514
- I know.

02:54.514 --> 02:56.720
- We're gonna, please go
there with Hamlet and Laertes.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.060
I heard the choreography yesterday
was a little too intense.

02:59.060 --> 03:00.250
What's going on over here?

03:00.250 --> 03:01.820
I saw her spinning before.

03:01.820 --> 03:02.760
Is that like a warmup?

03:02.760 --> 03:04.280
- Yes.
- Is that a thing we do?

03:04.280 --> 03:07.090
So why don't we spin our way onto the set.

03:07.090 --> 03:09.590
And these candles, this
is for Gertrude's bedroom.

03:11.737 --> 03:12.570
(exhales)

03:12.570 --> 03:13.403
Okay.

03:13.403 --> 03:14.443
Can we smoke it up please?

03:17.154 --> 03:19.654
(tense music)

03:35.320 --> 03:37.683
- Everybody quiet on
set, let's roll sound.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.123
Roll camera.

03:41.090 --> 03:45.153
Great, from the Horatio, scene
one output, take one, mark.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.593
(tense music)

03:51.040 --> 03:52.156
- And action!

03:53.793 --> 03:56.543
(dramatic music)

04:14.900 --> 04:18.813
- Tell my story.

04:22.320 --> 04:27.183
The rest is silence.

04:32.990 --> 04:36.050
- Although of Hamlet,
our dear brother's death,

04:36.050 --> 04:37.543
the memory be green.

04:38.630 --> 04:40.753
The time hath come to set our grief aside.

04:42.140 --> 04:45.883
Therefore our former
sister, and now our queen,

04:46.790 --> 04:48.783
we became man and wife.

04:56.070 --> 04:59.207
How is it that the clouds
still hang over you?

05:07.909 --> 05:11.100
- Good Hamlet, cast your
mourning clothing off

05:11.100 --> 05:13.893
and let your eye look
down with love on Denmark.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.680
Do not forever with your down cast lids

05:17.680 --> 05:19.453
seek for your noble father anymore.

05:26.305 --> 05:28.138
You know, it's normal.

05:30.830 --> 05:35.670
All that lives must die.

05:35.670 --> 05:37.743
Passing through nature to eternity.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.970
- I know it's normal, Mother.

05:45.970 --> 05:50.970
- If you know, why seems it
then so different with you?

05:51.340 --> 05:52.513
- Seems?

05:53.700 --> 05:56.720
No, it is.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.690
I know not seems.

05:59.690 --> 06:03.070
It's not alone my inky cloak, good mother,

06:03.070 --> 06:06.660
nor customary suit so solemn black,

06:06.660 --> 06:11.660
nor running river in my eye
could describe me truly.

06:11.890 --> 06:14.513
These indeed seem,

06:15.650 --> 06:18.363
for they're the actions
that a man might feign.

06:24.770 --> 06:28.203
What I feel inside, is not pretense.

06:30.410 --> 06:35.409
- It's good and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet,

06:36.260 --> 06:38.443
to reverently mourn your father's death.

06:40.830 --> 06:45.830
But to persist in endless
mourning is unmanly grief.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.270
You are direct successor to our throne

06:54.270 --> 06:56.430
and with no less nobility of love,

06:56.430 --> 07:00.240
any caring father bears his son.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.417
I offer up my love to you.

07:03.905 --> 07:06.405
(tense music)

07:17.840 --> 07:20.190
For your intent to go back
now to school at Wittenberg

07:20.190 --> 07:22.760
does go against our
prayers and our wishes.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.440
- We do implore-

07:24.440 --> 07:27.180
- And urge you to remain here,

07:27.180 --> 07:29.590
in the cheer and comfort of our court.

07:29.590 --> 07:33.053
Our foremost courtier
and our cherished son.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.990
- Let not your mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.560
Please stay with us.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.110
And don't return to Wittenberg.

07:48.420 --> 07:53.233
- I will obey your wishes,

07:57.440 --> 07:58.273
my dear mother.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.805
(tense music)

08:22.654 --> 08:26.571
Oh that this too, too
sullied flesh would melt,

08:30.190 --> 08:35.113
thaw, dissolve itself into a dew.

08:39.610 --> 08:42.299
Or that the everlasting
can not set his laws

08:42.299 --> 08:43.823
against self slaughter.

08:46.338 --> 08:47.171
God, oh God, how weary, stale, flat,

08:53.060 --> 08:57.143
and unprofitable seem to me
all the workings of this world.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.260
Heaven and earth, must I remember?

09:01.260 --> 09:05.020
Within a month she married
almost wicked speed

09:05.020 --> 09:10.020
to race with such alacrity,
to incestuous sheets.

09:10.130 --> 09:12.530
My God, a beast that
lacks all sense of reason

09:12.530 --> 09:13.830
would have mourned longer!

09:16.100 --> 09:17.160
But she...

09:21.240 --> 09:22.703
Married my uncle.

09:30.030 --> 09:31.293
My father's brother,

09:32.390 --> 09:37.390
but no more like my
father than I to Hercules.

09:42.230 --> 09:47.133
It cannot and it will not come to good.

09:53.720 --> 09:54.553
Horatio?

10:01.630 --> 10:03.822
(tense music)

10:03.822 --> 10:06.072
(laughing)

10:07.740 --> 10:10.440
What brings you here from
school at Wittenberg?

10:10.440 --> 10:11.950
- A truant disposition.

10:11.950 --> 10:16.740
- I know my fellow
student is not a truant.

10:16.740 --> 10:18.487
- Hamlet, Hamlet, Hamlet!

10:19.590 --> 10:20.423
- Oh.

10:22.110 --> 10:24.630
What a piece of work is a man.

10:24.630 --> 10:29.240
How noble in reason, how
infinite in faculties,

10:29.240 --> 10:34.240
informed and moving, how
express and admirable in action.

10:35.970 --> 10:40.970
How, like an angel in
apprehension, how like a-

10:44.840 --> 10:45.673
- God.

10:48.243 --> 10:49.076
(chuckles)

10:49.076 --> 10:53.413
- The beauty of the world,
the Paragon of animals.

10:54.560 --> 10:59.560
And yet to me, what is
this quintessence of?

11:05.297 --> 11:06.130
- Dust.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.470
- There are more things in
heaven and earth Horatio

11:14.470 --> 11:17.113
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.253
Now, what's brought about
this unexpected visit?

11:24.702 --> 11:27.740
(tense music)

11:27.740 --> 11:30.110
- Your father's unexpected funeral.

11:30.110 --> 11:32.173
- Not my mother's unexpected wedding?

11:34.040 --> 11:36.680
- Her hasty wedding came as a surprise.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.440
- Thrift, thrift, Horatio.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.240
The cooked meats left uneaten
at my father's funeral

11:41.240 --> 11:44.420
were coldly served up
at my mother's wedding.

11:44.420 --> 11:45.253
- Wedding.

11:46.643 --> 11:48.893
(laughing)

11:50.840 --> 11:53.013
- When I had met my dearest foe in heaven,

11:54.470 --> 11:57.680
than live to see that
hellish day, Horatio.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.953
And throughout it all,

12:02.270 --> 12:04.590
I still see my father.

12:04.590 --> 12:05.423
- See?

12:07.200 --> 12:08.033
Where?

12:11.750 --> 12:12.583
- Here.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.423
And in my mind's eye.

12:23.432 --> 12:25.087
(chuckles)

12:25.087 --> 12:27.463
- He was a goodly king.

12:29.460 --> 12:30.523
- He was a man.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.830
And even with his faults,

12:33.830 --> 12:35.873
I shall not look upon his like again.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.260
(sighing)

12:44.610 --> 12:45.443
- Hamlet...

12:49.680 --> 12:50.980
I think I saw your father,

12:53.370 --> 12:54.233
late last night.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.193
- Saw?

12:56.193 --> 12:58.123
- Yes.
- My father?

13:01.600 --> 13:04.120
- For two nights has the spirit

13:04.120 --> 13:06.620
of your father appeared before me.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.010
- Did he speak?

13:08.010 --> 13:11.360
- He lifted his head as if
to speak, but said nothing,

13:11.360 --> 13:13.250
and vanished before my sight.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.993
- My father's spirit?

13:19.620 --> 13:23.670
- His face was filled
with sorrow and despair.

13:32.470 --> 13:37.470
- I fear some foul play
and foul deeds will rise.

13:42.091 --> 13:44.674
(loud thunder)

13:46.390 --> 13:47.593
- Hear me, Hamlet.

13:48.792 --> 13:52.730
I am doomed to walk the
earth until the crimes

13:52.730 --> 13:57.730
done to me in my life are
burnt and purged away.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.680
- Crimes?

13:59.680 --> 14:04.583
- If ever you did love your
dearest father, revenge,

14:05.670 --> 14:09.023
my foul and most unholy murder.

14:09.890 --> 14:10.723
- Murder?

14:11.610 --> 14:13.293
- Murder most foul.

14:15.570 --> 14:17.570
While sleeping in my orchard,

14:17.570 --> 14:19.540
a serpent stung me.

14:19.540 --> 14:23.530
Dear Hamlet, know the serpent
that did take your father's

14:23.530 --> 14:26.423
life now wears his crown.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.133
- My uncle?

14:30.640 --> 14:35.640
- Yes, that incestuous, adulterous beast,

14:37.660 --> 14:42.660
with evil overtures and sensual
lust did seduce with guile

14:43.690 --> 14:46.860
my seeming virtuous queen.

14:46.860 --> 14:48.720
Asleep within my garden,

14:48.720 --> 14:51.180
your uncle stole upon me as I slept

14:51.180 --> 14:55.163
and poured a poison potion down my ear.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.867
And by my brother's hand
was I usurped of life,

15:01.830 --> 15:06.830
of crown, of queen and left for dead

15:07.150 --> 15:10.533
with all my imperfections unconfessed.

15:11.540 --> 15:16.230
Let not the royal bed
of Denmark be a couch

15:16.230 --> 15:19.023
for infidelity, and incest.

15:20.790 --> 15:25.790
Revenge my foul murder or I'm damned.

15:36.173 --> 15:37.683
- Alas poor ghost.

15:39.450 --> 15:41.643
I will remember you.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.200
I will not let your soul be cursed

15:45.200 --> 15:49.830
to walk upon this earth for all eternity.

15:49.830 --> 15:54.713
I will not sleep until you are revenged.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.303
Oh, villain, villain, smiling.

16:02.490 --> 16:04.130
Damn villain.

16:04.130 --> 16:09.130
How one may smile, smile and be a villain.

16:16.110 --> 16:17.983
- The time is out of joint.

16:24.253 --> 16:25.836
- Oh fateful night.

16:28.035 --> 16:32.553
That ever I was born to set it right.

16:36.789 --> 16:39.539
(dramatic music)

16:43.395 --> 16:45.645
(laughing)

16:47.287 --> 16:52.287
- For Hamlet's letter and
this trifle of his favor.

16:57.060 --> 16:59.723
It is just a passing
fancy and nothing more.

17:00.950 --> 17:05.950
A rose bud in the bloom
of a young man's nature.

17:06.829 --> 17:09.200
Passing, not permanent.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.089
Sweet, nothing more.

17:12.089 --> 17:13.490
- Nothing?

17:13.490 --> 17:15.683
- No, nothing.

17:17.210 --> 17:20.589
His high rank means his
will is not his own.

17:20.589 --> 17:22.903
And he is enslaved forever to his birth.

17:23.859 --> 17:26.670
Just think what loss
your honor may sustain

17:26.670 --> 17:31.460
if with too trusting
ear, you hear his songs,

17:31.460 --> 17:36.020
or you lose your heart, or...

17:40.780 --> 17:43.920
your chaste treasure open

17:43.920 --> 17:47.093
to his relentless royal overtures.

17:49.540 --> 17:52.013
Fear it, Ophelia.

17:52.930 --> 17:57.930
Fear it and remember my sister dear,

17:58.610 --> 18:02.283
best safety lies in fear.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.000
(tense music)

18:07.180 --> 18:09.730
- I'll keep in mind your
warning while you're gone.

18:10.820 --> 18:15.820
But, dear brother, do not
as some impious pastors do,

18:16.790 --> 18:19.750
show me the steep and
thorny path to heaven,

18:19.750 --> 18:22.550
while like a vein and reckless libertine

18:22.550 --> 18:27.443
the path of promiscuity
you take and turn deaf ear

18:32.350 --> 18:33.870
on your own advice.

18:33.870 --> 18:34.703
- Fear not.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.447
- Yet here, Laertes?

18:44.813 --> 18:46.870
(stuttering)

18:46.870 --> 18:47.970
Abort, abort.

18:47.970 --> 18:49.173
For shame!

18:56.210 --> 18:58.290
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail

18:58.290 --> 18:59.703
and you're still here.

19:02.980 --> 19:03.813
Fare ye well.

19:08.616 --> 19:11.283
(playful music)

19:25.050 --> 19:28.093
- Most humbly do I take
my leave, dear father.

19:28.093 --> 19:30.343
(grunting)

19:36.720 --> 19:39.550
Remember well, what I've said to you.

19:39.550 --> 19:41.100
- It's locked within my memory.

19:47.231 --> 19:49.731
(tense music)

19:57.837 --> 20:01.390
- What is it Ophelia,
that he has said to you?

20:01.390 --> 20:03.850
- He spoke of something
doing with Lord Hamlet.

20:03.850 --> 20:08.173
- Tell me what it is
between both you and Hamlet.

20:08.173 --> 20:10.420
- [Ophelia] He has of late
made many tender shows

20:10.420 --> 20:12.043
of his affection to me.

20:14.978 --> 20:18.700
- And you believe these
tender shows of his?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.153
- I do not know, dear
father, what to think.

20:26.578 --> 20:27.628
- Then I'll tell you.

20:29.260 --> 20:31.133
Stop acting like a little-

20:32.840 --> 20:34.893
Stop acting like a wanton.

20:36.290 --> 20:38.680
- My Lord, he has expressed his love

20:38.680 --> 20:40.480
to me in honorable fashion.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.997
- Aye, fashion you may call it.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.240
Foolish, foolish girl.

20:52.240 --> 20:55.620
- He's sworn the love
he feels for me is true.

20:55.620 --> 20:58.473
- Be wary daughter, of Lord Hamlet's vows.

21:01.430 --> 21:04.523
Do not believe his words
or cunning thoughts.

21:06.550 --> 21:11.200
I will not in plain terms
from this time forth,

21:11.200 --> 21:13.653
allow you to spend time
alone with him, or,

21:15.821 --> 21:20.821
you to speak a single word to him.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.510
- I shall obey, my Lord.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.940
(tense music)

21:59.181 --> 22:01.431
(laughing)

22:02.941 --> 22:06.024
(gentle piano music)

22:24.735 --> 22:26.985
(laughing)

22:35.880 --> 22:38.130
(laughing)

22:54.120 --> 22:54.953
- My Lord-

22:55.858 --> 22:58.701
(playful music)

22:58.701 --> 23:01.497
(clears throat)

23:01.497 --> 23:04.164
(playful music)

23:10.720 --> 23:11.733
- Polonius.

23:12.740 --> 23:14.580
Dear Gertrude has says he's found

23:14.580 --> 23:18.393
the very source of
Hamlet's strange behavior.

23:20.530 --> 23:23.873
- I'm sure it's nothing
more than we have discussed.

23:24.870 --> 23:29.870
His father's death and
our over-hasty marriage.

23:34.260 --> 23:39.260
- My Lord, since brevity
is the soul of wit,

23:39.330 --> 23:41.250
I will be brief.

23:41.250 --> 23:42.990
Your noble son is mad,

23:42.990 --> 23:46.770
his madness manifests itself in myriad-

23:46.770 --> 23:49.853
- More meaning, with the less art.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.803
- Madam, I swear I use no art at all.

23:56.410 --> 23:58.610
Lord Hamlet sent this
letter to my daughter.

24:02.577 --> 24:06.373
"To the celestial and
most beauteous Ophelia,

24:08.577 --> 24:10.797
"and her excellent white breasts-

24:10.797 --> 24:12.443
"Bosom, bosom, bosom."

24:14.750 --> 24:17.298
- Hamlet sent this to her?

24:17.298 --> 24:18.543
- Yes, yes, madam.

24:19.807 --> 24:21.737
"Doubt that the stars are higher,

24:21.737 --> 24:23.317
"doubt that the sun is above,

24:23.317 --> 24:25.173
"doubt truth to be a liar,

24:27.187 --> 24:29.496
"but never doubt I love.

24:29.496 --> 24:31.677
(sniggering)

24:31.677 --> 24:35.400
"Oh dear, Ophelia, I am
yours forevermore, Hamlet."

24:35.400 --> 24:37.620
- Has she received his love?

24:37.620 --> 24:41.303
- I gave her stringent
orders that she should not.

24:42.590 --> 24:46.453
That she should lock herself
against any approaches.

24:48.270 --> 24:50.433
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.

24:52.720 --> 24:57.720
Rejection, rejection is the
cause of Hamlet's madness.

25:01.510 --> 25:04.380
- How can we be certain?

25:09.253 --> 25:13.836
- You know, he always walks
alone there in the hallway.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.497
I'll have Ophelia waiting there for him.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.433
- And?

25:23.433 --> 25:28.070
- We'll hide ourselves and
we'll see what happens.

25:31.930 --> 25:32.793
- We will do it.

25:36.532 --> 25:39.282
(dramatic music)

25:41.070 --> 25:41.903
- My Lord.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.560
The player King has arrived.

25:50.941 --> 25:53.274
(chuckling)

26:00.760 --> 26:01.773
- Welcome!

26:04.830 --> 26:05.663
Old friend.

26:06.560 --> 26:07.823
- Thank you my Lord.

26:08.670 --> 26:12.110
- So what shall we have
the actors perform for us?

26:12.110 --> 26:14.063
- A comedy?
- No.

26:15.470 --> 26:20.470
I once saw you perform a play
called The Murder of Gonzago.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.880
- Aye my Lord.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.270
- Could you perform it tomorrow night?

26:25.270 --> 26:26.460
- Certainly my Lord.

26:26.460 --> 26:29.550
- And could you learn a
speech of some 12 or 16 lines

26:29.550 --> 26:30.383
which I would write for-

26:30.383 --> 26:31.216
- Hamlet.

26:32.138 --> 26:33.763
- Aye, my Lord.

26:35.661 --> 26:38.161
(tense music)

26:42.470 --> 26:44.490
- Then go, make you ready.

26:44.490 --> 26:47.413
You are welcome to Elsinore Castle.

26:50.510 --> 26:51.560
- Thank you, my Lord.

26:55.350 --> 26:56.590
- My Lord.

26:56.590 --> 26:57.540
Follow me this way.

27:00.921 --> 27:03.504
(tense music)

27:16.530 --> 27:21.450
- For all I know, my father's
ghost might be the work

27:21.450 --> 27:26.450
of the devil trying to
deceive and damn me.

27:33.150 --> 27:35.710
I'll have these actors enact the murder

27:35.710 --> 27:38.380
of my father as described
to me by the ghost

27:38.380 --> 27:40.100
before my uncle.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.140
I'll observe my uncle closely.

27:42.140 --> 27:44.903
If he but blink at the
moment of poisoning,

27:46.510 --> 27:50.620
I'll know for sure he's guilty, and...

27:54.867 --> 27:56.367
And I'll kill him.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.730
The play's the thing

28:07.710 --> 28:10.910
wherein I'll catch the
conscience of the King.

28:12.143 --> 28:15.246
I swear it, I swear it, I swear it,

28:15.246 --> 28:17.163
I swear it, I swear it!

28:18.169 --> 28:20.906
(heavy breathing)

28:20.906 --> 28:23.656
(ethereal music)

28:24.910 --> 28:27.550
Father who art in heaven,

28:27.550 --> 28:29.300
hallowed be thy name.

28:48.910 --> 28:51.243
(muttering)

29:08.399 --> 29:11.149
(dramatic music)

29:28.338 --> 29:29.171
To be...

29:51.661 --> 29:52.494
Or...

30:01.197 --> 30:02.030
Not to be.

30:07.693 --> 30:09.273
That is the question.

30:10.680 --> 30:15.680
Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer

30:16.110 --> 30:20.613
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune.

30:25.800 --> 30:30.633
- Or, take arms against a sea
of troubles and by opposing,

30:33.720 --> 30:34.553
end them.

30:40.953 --> 30:45.413
- To die, to sleep,

30:49.590 --> 30:50.483
no more.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.493
- And by sleep, to say-

30:57.900 --> 31:02.430
- We end the heartache of
a thousand natural shocks

31:02.430 --> 31:03.653
the flesh is air to.

31:05.970 --> 31:10.930
'Tis a consolation devoutly
to be wished, to die.

31:17.116 --> 31:17.949
- To sleep.

31:19.901 --> 31:22.401
(tense music)

31:25.650 --> 31:26.483
- To sleep,

31:31.421 --> 31:34.383
perchance to dream.

31:37.170 --> 31:39.420
- But in that sleep of death,

31:39.420 --> 31:41.750
what dreams may come when we have shuffled

31:41.750 --> 31:45.220
off this mortal coil, this...

31:49.936 --> 31:51.519
must give us pause.

31:59.750 --> 32:03.190
- The dread of something after death.

32:03.190 --> 32:08.180
- Yes, the undiscovered
country from whose borders

32:10.210 --> 32:11.683
no traveler returns.

32:12.700 --> 32:16.730
- And this makes us rather
bare those ills we have.

32:16.730 --> 32:18.880
- Than fight to others
that we know not of.

32:23.978 --> 32:26.145
(sighing)

32:27.180 --> 32:30.167
- Thus conscience does
make cowards of us all.

32:35.900 --> 32:37.123
- And we lose the name.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.503
- Of action.
- Of action.

32:48.543 --> 32:51.293
(dramatic music)

32:54.570 --> 32:55.960
- Remember me, Hamlet.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.423
Revenge my foul murder.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.233
Revenge me.

33:08.140 --> 33:09.163
Swear it.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.249
- I swear.

33:12.249 --> 33:14.639
- Swear it.

33:14.639 --> 33:16.244
- I swear.

33:16.244 --> 33:20.082
I swear it, I swear it,
I swear it, I swear it,

33:20.082 --> 33:22.209
I swear it, I swear it, I swear it!

33:22.209 --> 33:24.376
(sobbing)

33:25.667 --> 33:29.485
I swear it!

33:29.485 --> 33:31.985
(tense music)

33:36.586 --> 33:40.090
- Get what you can from him.
- I shall, my Lord.

33:40.090 --> 33:43.023
- Ophelia, sit you down here.

33:44.550 --> 33:47.450
Gracious King so please you,

33:47.450 --> 33:52.450
we will conceal ourselves
behind the tapestry.

33:59.128 --> 34:00.961
Pray you on this book,

34:03.270 --> 34:05.133
with feigned devotion.

34:09.085 --> 34:11.585
(tense music)

34:15.040 --> 34:15.873
Sit.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.433
- How does my Lord on such a lovely day?

34:35.328 --> 34:36.161
- Well.

34:41.210 --> 34:42.043
Well.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.708
Well.

34:46.708 --> 34:49.376
- What are you reading, my Lord?

34:54.889 --> 34:56.228
- Words.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.305
(chuckling)

34:57.305 --> 34:58.138
Words.

35:02.426 --> 35:03.259
Words.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.313
- My Lord.

35:10.200 --> 35:15.200
I have this gift of yours and some poems.

35:21.800 --> 35:26.053
And I ask you now to
kindly take them back.

35:27.190 --> 35:28.023
- No, not I.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.293
I never gave you those.

35:32.460 --> 35:35.453
- My honor, Lord, you know
right and well you did.

35:36.730 --> 35:41.473
And with them words of
such sweet breath composed,

35:42.660 --> 35:44.223
made them all the more rich.

35:46.730 --> 35:49.080
Please take these gifts
you gave me back again.

35:50.420 --> 35:55.413
Such gifts prove poor when
the giver proves unkind.

35:57.146 --> 35:59.646
(tense music)

36:09.302 --> 36:11.219
- I did love you, once.

36:15.450 --> 36:16.350
- Indeed, my Lord.

36:17.330 --> 36:18.790
You made me think you did.

36:23.952 --> 36:28.653
- Well, you should not have believed me.

36:29.770 --> 36:33.043
I love you not.

36:35.866 --> 36:36.966
- Then I was deceived.

36:40.660 --> 36:42.230
- Are you honest?

36:42.230 --> 36:43.713
- Honest?
- Yes.

36:45.350 --> 36:49.223
If so, get thee to a nunnery.

36:50.130 --> 36:52.363
Why would you be a breeder of sinners?

36:53.290 --> 36:54.690
What do you expect from men?

36:55.710 --> 36:58.563
We are all utter knaves.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.713
Believe none of us.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.543
Make your way to a nunnery.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.070
Where is your father?

37:24.070 --> 37:25.590
- At home, my Lord.

37:25.590 --> 37:27.400
- Let the doors be shut upon him

37:28.600 --> 37:31.853
so that he may play the fool
nowhere but in his own house.

37:33.690 --> 37:34.523
Farewell.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.220
- Oh, help him, sweet heavens.

37:39.870 --> 37:43.733
- And if you must marry, marry a fool.

37:44.800 --> 37:47.260
For wise men know only
too well what monsters

37:47.260 --> 37:48.163
you make of them.

37:49.580 --> 37:52.233
To a nunnery, go.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.984
And quickly too.

37:55.984 --> 37:58.484
(tense music)

38:04.970 --> 38:05.803
(chuckling)

38:05.803 --> 38:06.636
Farewell.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.953
- Oh, heavenly powers, restore him.

38:11.505 --> 38:14.005
(tense music)

38:16.060 --> 38:20.910
- I have seen your painted
faces all too often.

38:20.910 --> 38:23.290
God has given you one face

38:23.290 --> 38:25.420
and you change it to another.

38:25.420 --> 38:29.000
You dance, you sigh, you flirt,

38:29.000 --> 38:32.963
you cover up your wantonness
with feigned innocence.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.880
Enough.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.210
I'll no more of it.

38:38.070 --> 38:39.847
It has made me mad.

38:48.050 --> 38:50.010
I say that from this day forward,

38:50.010 --> 38:52.260
we will have no more marriages.

38:52.260 --> 38:54.683
Those that are married
already, shall live on.

38:56.490 --> 38:57.437
Except one.

38:59.589 --> 39:01.640
(tense music)

39:01.640 --> 39:02.533
To a nunnery.

39:05.220 --> 39:07.240
To a nunnery.

39:09.450 --> 39:10.283
Go.

39:34.128 --> 39:36.295
(sobbing)

39:50.048 --> 39:52.631
(gentle music)

40:02.986 --> 40:05.569
(wind rushing)

40:21.987 --> 40:23.630
- It is not so!
- Think for a moment.

40:23.630 --> 40:25.180
- Madness?

40:25.180 --> 40:26.363
Mad for love?

40:27.300 --> 40:29.730
His actions did not
point in that direction.

40:29.730 --> 40:32.140
- Perhaps, but I believe
the origin and cause

40:32.140 --> 40:36.083
of his wild grief resulted
from rejected love.

40:37.550 --> 40:40.330
- I know there's
something in his very soul

40:40.330 --> 40:43.950
on which his melancholy grows and broods.

40:43.950 --> 40:48.580
And I do fear and sense the
end result will lead to danger

40:48.580 --> 40:51.523
which we must prevent.

40:54.270 --> 40:57.437
(gentle piano music)

41:02.080 --> 41:05.313
He must be sent to England without delay.

41:07.020 --> 41:09.353
His death there has been prearranged.

41:11.460 --> 41:12.293
See to it.

41:12.293 --> 41:15.340
- I will, but if we wait
until the play is over,

41:15.340 --> 41:19.950
his mother could all alone
entreat him to speak his mind.

41:19.950 --> 41:21.860
Let her be blunt with him.

41:21.860 --> 41:24.840
And I, I could stay within ear's range.

41:24.840 --> 41:27.229
And if she cannot calm him, then I-

41:27.229 --> 41:30.740
- We'll send him on a
fateful trip to England.

41:32.169 --> 41:34.347
(chuckling)

41:34.347 --> 41:35.353
(wind rushing)

41:35.353 --> 41:37.673
To England.
- To England!

41:37.673 --> 41:40.173
(tense music)

41:49.130 --> 41:51.363
- Horatio.
- Mm?

41:52.860 --> 41:57.860
- You are as wise as you are just.

42:00.588 --> 42:01.993
- Am I?
- Yes.

42:05.290 --> 42:10.290
And since my soul, mistress of my mind,

42:10.480 --> 42:15.480
she has cherished you the
most above all others.

42:19.470 --> 42:20.303
- Me?

42:22.570 --> 42:24.700
- She's chosen you for herself

42:25.610 --> 42:30.610
because you are a soul
who is suffering all,

42:33.650 --> 42:34.863
has suffered nothing.

42:35.710 --> 42:40.710
A man whose fortunes,
downfalls, and rewards you take

42:46.450 --> 42:47.653
with equal grace.

42:53.326 --> 42:55.040
(chuckles)

42:55.040 --> 42:55.873
- Do I?

42:59.220 --> 43:04.190
- Give me the man who
is not passion's slave

43:05.540 --> 43:10.490
and I will hold him in my heart's core.

43:10.490 --> 43:15.167
Yes, in my heart of hearts, as I do you.

43:20.089 --> 43:23.172
(gentle piano music)

43:43.246 --> 43:44.496
- And I do you.

43:50.470 --> 43:55.470
- I can't believe I am alive to say

43:56.770 --> 44:01.093
my father's murderer's still unpunished.

44:04.470 --> 44:09.143
He that killed my
father, whored my mother,

44:10.020 --> 44:15.020
dashed my future hopes, is still alive.

44:32.760 --> 44:36.123
- How circumstances all
have turned against you.

44:36.990 --> 44:38.930
- Then Denmark has been
turned into a prison.

44:38.930 --> 44:40.030
- Then is the world one?

44:40.030 --> 44:42.770
- Oh, a large one, with many dungeons,

44:42.770 --> 44:44.913
Denmark being the worst.

44:49.240 --> 44:50.313
- I do not think so.

44:53.650 --> 44:58.650
There's nothing good or bad,
but thinking makes it so.

44:58.770 --> 45:03.510
- Do you not think that
fate calls upon me to smite

45:03.510 --> 45:05.643
my sinful uncle with my sword?

45:07.910 --> 45:11.530
And will I not be damned if I
allow this canker of my being

45:11.530 --> 45:12.513
commit more evil?

45:13.529 --> 45:15.696
(sighing)

45:18.580 --> 45:21.233
- And all the heartfelt
sorrows that beset you,

45:24.370 --> 45:26.433
now spur you to revenge.

45:27.347 --> 45:30.097
(dramatic music)

45:39.646 --> 45:40.546
- There is a scene

45:44.307 --> 45:45.957
that I have written for the play,

45:46.950 --> 45:51.703
which mirrors what the
ghost described to us.

45:54.800 --> 45:57.923
Observe my uncle.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.650
If his hidden guilt is not revealed

46:01.650 --> 46:03.660
within the opening scene,

46:03.660 --> 46:07.883
it is a demon ghost that spoke to us.

46:13.490 --> 46:16.467
We'll match our thoughts
up when the play is done.

46:18.304 --> 46:20.637
- I'll watch his every move.

46:23.769 --> 46:26.269
(tense music)

46:28.273 --> 46:30.440
(sighing)

46:58.960 --> 47:00.543
- From this time forth,

47:02.390 --> 47:04.963
our thoughts be bloody,

47:08.920 --> 47:10.227
or they be nothing at all.

47:11.803 --> 47:14.553
(dramatic music)

47:25.074 --> 47:27.858
(audience applaud)

47:27.858 --> 47:30.525
(bright music)

47:38.710 --> 47:40.727
- For us and our tragedy,

47:43.255 --> 47:45.505
we welcome you to our play.

47:49.056 --> 47:51.973
(audience applaud)

47:57.900 --> 48:01.203
- My limbs grow weak,

48:02.620 --> 48:07.620
and now I would end the
tedious day with sleep.

48:11.037 --> 48:13.537
(tense music)

48:21.997 --> 48:23.410
- What do you call the play?

48:23.410 --> 48:24.840
- The Mouse Trap.

48:24.840 --> 48:28.120
The play's a reenactment
of a murder done in Vienna.

48:28.120 --> 48:30.660
Gonzago is the King's name.

48:30.660 --> 48:34.520
It's a navish act, but
what of that, Your Majesty?

48:34.520 --> 48:38.393
For those of us with
sinless souls matters not.

48:42.338 --> 48:43.336
(tense music)

48:43.336 --> 48:46.253
(audience applaud)

48:47.640 --> 48:52.410
This is one Lucianus, brother to the king.

48:52.410 --> 48:54.593
Begin murderer.

48:55.778 --> 48:58.303
Come the croaking raven cries for revenge.

49:04.056 --> 49:07.139
- What black hands poised, drugs set,

49:10.317 --> 49:11.903
the time agreeing.

49:13.220 --> 49:18.220
No mortal is about, no creature seen.

49:18.350 --> 49:22.480
Thy mixture rank of
midnight weeds collected,

49:22.480 --> 49:26.163
distilled three times to infected.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.893
With such strength and lethal potency,

49:32.830 --> 49:34.747
a healthy soul expires.

49:44.656 --> 49:45.573
Helplessly.

49:49.357 --> 49:52.114
(tense music)

49:52.114 --> 49:54.364
(groaning)

49:58.815 --> 50:01.982
(electricity humming)

50:03.154 --> 50:05.404
(giggling)

50:13.976 --> 50:16.818
(hissing)

50:16.818 --> 50:19.539
(choking)

50:19.539 --> 50:22.372
(wicked laughing)

50:30.776 --> 50:33.609
(wicked laughing)

50:40.877 --> 50:43.794
(audience applaud)

50:49.430 --> 50:51.493
- You shall see now.

50:53.151 --> 50:56.068
(audience applaud)

50:57.630 --> 50:58.463
You shall now-

51:00.230 --> 51:05.200
You shall now see how the
murderer gets the love

51:05.200 --> 51:07.623
of King Gonzago's wife.

51:08.936 --> 51:11.436
(tense music)

51:16.178 --> 51:17.011
- Ah.

51:18.260 --> 51:19.123
- What's wrong?

51:23.260 --> 51:24.093
- Lights.

51:29.010 --> 51:29.843
Lights.

51:32.274 --> 51:33.107
Give me light!

51:34.240 --> 51:35.073
- Stop the play.

51:36.877 --> 51:39.377
(tense music)

51:54.350 --> 51:56.850
- Did you see his face at
the moment of poisoning?

51:58.920 --> 52:01.498
- The ghost spoke the truth.

52:01.498 --> 52:02.350
(laughing)

52:02.350 --> 52:05.130
- Hamlet!
- Polonius.

52:05.130 --> 52:06.390
- Come.
- Hamlet-

52:06.390 --> 52:07.910
- Some music!

52:07.910 --> 52:09.536
Shall we dance?

52:09.536 --> 52:11.120
- Hamlet, stop!

52:11.120 --> 52:11.953
My Lord!

52:13.398 --> 52:16.148
(wind whistling)

52:21.430 --> 52:24.633
The Queen would speak with you, without-

52:30.500 --> 52:33.053
Without delay.

52:38.880 --> 52:41.963
- I will come to my mother by and by.

52:49.520 --> 52:50.633
- I will say so.

52:53.816 --> 52:56.066
(grunting)

52:57.739 --> 53:02.739
- By and by is easily said.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.880
- Easily, I will say so.
- He will say so.

53:10.880 --> 53:12.000
- I will!

53:12.000 --> 53:14.296
(mocking barking)

53:14.296 --> 53:15.546
I will say so!

53:28.998 --> 53:31.915
(thunder cracks)

53:31.915 --> 53:34.998
(electricity buzzes)

53:43.960 --> 53:48.430
- It is now the very
witching time of night

53:49.360 --> 53:54.360
where church yards yawn
and hell itself breeds

53:56.250 --> 54:00.593
out contagion to this world.

54:01.680 --> 54:06.680
But now could I drink hot blood
and do such bitter business

54:08.900 --> 54:11.363
as the day would quake to look on.

54:15.060 --> 54:18.163
And now off to my mother.

54:20.857 --> 54:25.607
Let me be cruel with
her, but not overly so.

54:30.620 --> 54:33.963
I will speak daggers to her,

54:37.090 --> 54:40.703
but use none.

54:48.297 --> 54:50.464
(sighing)

54:55.791 --> 54:58.291
(tense music)

55:09.330 --> 55:10.933
- Hurry, he's on his way.

55:19.178 --> 55:20.994
(door creaking)

55:20.994 --> 55:22.494
Be blunt with him.

55:24.950 --> 55:29.950
I'm going to conceal
myself behind the screen.

55:34.413 --> 55:36.913
(tense music)

55:38.820 --> 55:41.763
- Mother, mother, mother, mother.

55:54.150 --> 55:56.563
Mother, what's the matter?

55:58.194 --> 56:01.883
- Hamlet, you have your
father much offended.

56:05.200 --> 56:08.270
- Mother, you have my
father much offended.

56:08.270 --> 56:11.010
- Come, come, you answer
with a willful tongue.

56:11.010 --> 56:13.000
- Go go, you question
with a wicked tongue.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.563
- Don't speak to me like that.

56:18.280 --> 56:19.113
- What's the matter?

56:19.113 --> 56:20.460
- Have you forgot who I am?

56:22.472 --> 56:24.720
- You are...

56:29.271 --> 56:30.680
the queen.

56:30.680 --> 56:34.300
Your husband's brother's wife.

56:34.300 --> 56:38.003
When it were not so, you were my mother.

56:39.440 --> 56:40.273
- All right then.

56:40.273 --> 56:42.410
I'll call for those
who'll curb your tongue.

56:43.580 --> 56:46.763
- You shall not budge or move.

56:48.470 --> 56:53.470
Now hold still and look until
you see inside your very soul.

57:00.430 --> 57:01.263
- What?

57:02.890 --> 57:04.163
Will you murder me?

57:05.780 --> 57:06.613
Help!

57:08.214 --> 57:10.714
(tense music)

57:15.310 --> 57:18.923
- How now, a rat.

57:22.040 --> 57:24.973
Dead as a doornail.

57:29.192 --> 57:31.692
(tense music)

57:47.373 --> 57:49.623
(grunting)

57:55.050 --> 57:56.100
- What have you done?

57:57.998 --> 58:00.165
(panting)

58:01.680 --> 58:03.390
- Is it the king?

58:03.390 --> 58:05.980
- What a rash and bloody deed is this.

58:05.980 --> 58:07.223
- A bloody deed.

58:09.600 --> 58:14.600
Almost as bad good mother, as kill a king

58:16.080 --> 58:18.010
and marry with his brother.

58:18.010 --> 58:19.003
- As kill a king?

58:20.170 --> 58:21.523
- Yes, Mother.

58:26.110 --> 58:27.060
That's what I said.

58:28.722 --> 58:31.222
(tense music)

58:59.820 --> 59:02.070
How rash and wretched fool.

59:04.439 --> 59:05.272
Farewell.

59:07.441 --> 59:08.274
Took you for your better.

59:13.239 --> 59:14.072
(tense music)

59:14.072 --> 59:14.905
Take your fortune.

59:31.730 --> 59:33.033
You ring your hands.

59:34.980 --> 59:37.743
But I will ring your heart.

59:39.140 --> 59:40.580
- What have I done?

59:40.580 --> 59:43.640
- An act that makes your marriage vows

59:44.660 --> 59:47.510
as false as gambler's oats.

59:47.510 --> 59:48.343
- What act?

59:50.830 --> 59:54.513
- Look, here, upon this picture.

59:56.120 --> 59:56.953
And...

1:00:00.490 --> 1:00:05.490
On this, the true to life
depiction of two brothers.

1:00:08.210 --> 1:00:12.690
Behold, the grace and power of his face.

1:00:12.690 --> 1:00:16.180
And I like Mars to threaten and command.

1:00:16.180 --> 1:00:19.763
This was your husband.

1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:23.453
Look you now what follows.

1:00:24.810 --> 1:00:29.653
Here is your husband.

1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:35.720
Like an abscessed ear, pale
against his wholesome brother.

1:00:38.490 --> 1:00:40.200
Have you eyes?

1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:43.563
You turn from this, to this?

1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:45.603
What are you, blind?

1:00:46.778 --> 1:00:47.700
(chuckles)

1:00:47.700 --> 1:00:52.050
Eyes without feeling,
feeling without sight.

1:00:52.050 --> 1:00:53.880
You cannot call it love.

1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:56.610
For at your age, the
heyday of your passion

1:00:56.610 --> 1:00:59.090
grows tame and weak.

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:04.220
Oh blush, have you no shame?

1:01:04.220 --> 1:01:05.053
- Hamlet.

1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:07.873
Speak no more.

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:13.433
You have turned my eyes into my very soul,

1:01:14.820 --> 1:01:18.980
and there I see indelible black spots

1:01:18.980 --> 1:01:20.303
that will not fade away.

1:01:22.823 --> 1:01:26.950
- I do not live and wallow
in a rank and loathsome bed,

1:01:26.950 --> 1:01:29.770
stewed in corruption
with incestuous sheets.

1:01:29.770 --> 1:01:32.743
- Don't say another word.

1:01:34.380 --> 1:01:38.730
Your words, like daggers through my ears.

1:01:38.730 --> 1:01:40.127
No more, sweet Hamlet.

1:01:41.550 --> 1:01:45.060
- A murderer and villain,
a cutthroat of the kingdom

1:01:45.060 --> 1:01:48.420
and the state who stole the
crown upon my father's head,

1:01:48.420 --> 1:01:49.680
and placed it on his own.

1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:51.160
- No more.

1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:54.519
- King of shreds and patches.

1:01:54.519 --> 1:01:55.493
- No more.

1:01:57.543 --> 1:02:00.043
(tense music)

1:02:03.990 --> 1:02:08.990
- I must be cruel, only to be kind.

1:02:11.260 --> 1:02:12.839
(dramatic music)

1:02:12.839 --> 1:02:15.460
(thunder cracking)

1:02:15.460 --> 1:02:20.110
Protect me with your grace
and outstretched wings.

1:02:20.110 --> 1:02:23.493
- I come to stir your
soul, to take revenge.

1:02:24.890 --> 1:02:25.723
Look there.

1:02:27.770 --> 1:02:29.653
Amazement on your mother's eyes.

1:02:30.620 --> 1:02:33.483
Go step between her and her tortured soul,

1:02:36.183 --> 1:02:39.010
but howsoever you revenge my murder,

1:02:39.010 --> 1:02:41.620
don't take her life.

1:02:41.620 --> 1:02:43.160
Leave her to heaven.

1:02:44.180 --> 1:02:45.113
Speak to her.

1:02:46.050 --> 1:02:51.050
- Please, do not come before me anymore.

1:02:51.150 --> 1:02:55.280
Your soulful look brings
tears into my eyes.

1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:59.243
- Revenge me.

1:03:06.759 --> 1:03:08.176
- Who do you see?

1:03:10.380 --> 1:03:11.530
With whom do you speak?

1:03:12.810 --> 1:03:14.200
- Did you see nothing?

1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:15.227
- Nothing at all.

1:03:16.980 --> 1:03:18.370
- Nor heard nothing.

1:03:18.370 --> 1:03:19.203
- No.

1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:25.760
- My father, I saw my father.

1:03:25.760 --> 1:03:29.780
- This ghostly appearance is but madness.

1:03:46.220 --> 1:03:47.623
- Save your soul.

1:03:49.820 --> 1:03:51.713
Confess yourself to heaven.

1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:55.803
Repent your past.

1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:01.573
Avoid a tragic future.

1:04:05.122 --> 1:04:06.205
- Oh, Hamlet.

1:04:09.300 --> 1:04:12.777
You split my trembling heart in two.

1:04:17.940 --> 1:04:19.833
- I'll throw away the evil part,

1:04:22.190 --> 1:04:24.940
and live far purer with the other half.

1:04:27.558 --> 1:04:30.058
(tense music)

1:04:31.442 --> 1:04:32.603
To England I've been ordered.

1:04:35.682 --> 1:04:36.515
- I know.

1:04:38.114 --> 1:04:40.697
(solemn music)

1:05:00.642 --> 1:05:03.442
- [Hamlet] What is a
man, if the chief goal

1:05:03.442 --> 1:05:04.300
and focus of his life

1:05:04.300 --> 1:05:06.490
be but to sleep and eat.

1:05:06.490 --> 1:05:09.740
Once in my heart, I had a fear of death

1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:11.537
that would not let me sleep.

1:05:11.537 --> 1:05:15.370
But now I see there's
a divinity that shapes

1:05:15.370 --> 1:05:20.370
all of our ends, no matter
what we will or say or do.

1:05:20.580 --> 1:05:24.380
And life ends faster
than you can count one.

1:05:24.380 --> 1:05:26.060
Resign yourself to fate.

1:05:26.060 --> 1:05:28.563
Just let it be.

1:05:30.358 --> 1:05:31.191
Let it be.

1:05:33.239 --> 1:05:35.719
(sobbing)

1:05:35.719 --> 1:05:38.919
(dramatic music)

1:05:38.919 --> 1:05:42.297
Let it be, let it be, let it be,

1:05:42.297 --> 1:05:46.023
let it be, let it be,
let it be, let it be,

1:05:46.023 --> 1:05:47.773
let it be, let it be!

1:05:51.959 --> 1:05:52.792
- Cut!

1:05:53.957 --> 1:05:56.318
(sobbing)

1:05:56.318 --> 1:05:57.151
Cut!

1:05:58.242 --> 1:06:01.325
(gentle piano music)

1:06:03.639 --> 1:06:06.472
- Let it be, let it be, let it be.

1:06:09.399 --> 1:06:10.399
- Moving on.

1:06:12.140 --> 1:06:14.057
- Let it be, let it be.

1:06:19.690 --> 1:06:20.533
- Moving on.

1:06:23.063 --> 1:06:26.813
- Let it be, let it be,
let it be, let it be.

1:06:30.023 --> 1:06:32.773
(dramatic music)

1:06:37.282 --> 1:06:40.532
- Where is the handsome son of Denmark?

1:06:57.143 --> 1:06:59.122

Ophelia!

1:08:37.804 --> 1:08:39.500
- They are to blame.

1:08:39.500 --> 1:08:41.750
(laughing)

1:08:53.790 --> 1:08:55.490
- How long has she been like this?

1:09:00.550 --> 1:09:02.200
- Ever since your father's death.

1:09:07.250 --> 1:09:08.773
- I will be revenged.

1:09:10.637 --> 1:09:13.219
(uneasy music)

1:09:23.870 --> 1:09:25.243
- There's rosemary.

1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:28.913
That's for remembrance.

1:09:31.180 --> 1:09:32.013
- Kind sister.

1:09:33.420 --> 1:09:34.580
Sweet Ophelia.

1:09:37.164 --> 1:09:38.581
- Pray you, love.

1:09:40.170 --> 1:09:41.003
Remember me.

1:09:44.801 --> 1:09:46.801
(gasps)

1:09:47.870 --> 1:09:48.853
- Ah heavens.

1:09:49.780 --> 1:09:52.120
Is it possible a young
maid's witch be as mortal

1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:53.452
as an old man's life?

1:09:55.004 --> 1:09:57.587
(gentle music)

1:10:06.663 --> 1:10:08.746
- There's fennel for you.

1:10:12.820 --> 1:10:14.070
And columbines.

1:10:15.857 --> 1:10:19.463
That's for infidelity.

1:10:30.900 --> 1:10:32.457
There's rue for you.

1:10:35.623 --> 1:10:37.983
That's for repentance.

1:10:43.884 --> 1:10:47.090
I would give you some
violets for faithfulness but,

1:10:47.090 --> 1:10:50.493
they withered when my father died.

1:10:51.859 --> 1:10:53.380
- Oh God.

1:10:53.380 --> 1:10:55.193
- Come with me, my child.

1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:58.840
- Come, my coach.

1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:00.440
Goodnight ladies.

1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:03.053
Goodnight, sweet ladies.

1:11:03.900 --> 1:11:04.950
Goodnight (laughing).

1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:06.673
Goodnight.

1:11:07.543 --> 1:11:09.710
Goodnight.

1:11:09.710 --> 1:11:13.353
- By heaven, her madness will be revenged.

1:11:13.353 --> 1:11:15.853
(tense music)

1:11:19.710 --> 1:11:20.543
- My Lord.

1:11:23.858 --> 1:11:26.300
I have a letter here from Lord Hamlet

1:11:26.300 --> 1:11:27.763
delivered by sailor.

1:11:34.807 --> 1:11:36.246
- "Reverent King,

1:11:36.246 --> 1:11:38.837
"know that I've returned to your kingdom.

1:11:38.837 --> 1:11:41.416
"I ask your pardon and
beg leave to see you,

1:11:41.416 --> 1:11:46.387
"when I shall explain the
circumstances of my return."

1:11:48.469 --> 1:11:50.100
- Do you recognize the writing?

1:11:50.100 --> 1:11:51.853
- It's clearly Hamlet's hand.

1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:55.353
Leave us.

1:11:57.116 --> 1:11:59.616
(tense music)

1:12:00.590 --> 1:12:03.490
- It cures the very sickness in my heart

1:12:03.490 --> 1:12:05.840
that I shall live to
tell him face to face,

1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:07.763
you are a dead man.

1:12:08.809 --> 1:12:12.600
- If he comes back,
what would you undertake

1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:15.059
to show yourself your father's son,

1:12:15.059 --> 1:12:17.100
in deed as well in word?

1:12:17.100 --> 1:12:19.670
- I'd cut his throat in church.

1:12:19.670 --> 1:12:23.170
- If he returns, I shall devise his death

1:12:23.170 --> 1:12:26.550
in such a way shall not fail to fall

1:12:26.550 --> 1:12:28.740
and make it all look like an accident.

1:12:28.740 --> 1:12:31.660
So even Gertrude will not know the truth.

1:12:31.660 --> 1:12:34.520
- And I will be the agent of his fall.

1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:38.450
- If he returns, I'll
praise your swordsmanship

1:12:38.450 --> 1:12:41.170
and challenge him to meet you in a bout.

1:12:41.170 --> 1:12:44.370
I'll make a wager he shall outdo you.

1:12:44.370 --> 1:12:47.850
He, unsuspecting, will not
notice if you use a foil

1:12:47.850 --> 1:12:50.023
whose tip you have unblunted.

1:12:51.377 --> 1:12:56.377
And thus, you shall revenge
your father's death.

1:12:57.340 --> 1:12:59.130
- Hell, when I unblunt my foil,

1:12:59.130 --> 1:13:00.460
I'll dip the point in poison

1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:02.430
I have brought with me from France.

1:13:02.430 --> 1:13:06.279
So mortal that a knife that's
dipped in it brings instant

1:13:06.279 --> 1:13:07.929
death with just a little scratch.

1:13:11.510 --> 1:13:16.253
- In case that fails,
we need a second plan.

1:13:17.370 --> 1:13:21.702
When from the bout, he
gets a little thirsty,

1:13:22.969 --> 1:13:27.503
I'll offer him a drink
that's tinged with poison.

1:13:30.197 --> 1:13:32.697
(tense music)

1:13:46.780 --> 1:13:49.530
(dramatic music)

1:13:55.190 --> 1:14:00.190
- [Hamlet] What is this
quintessence of dust?

1:14:05.419 --> 1:14:10.419
What is this quintessence
of dust, of dust, of dust?

1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:21.883
(tense guitar music)

1:14:27.377 --> 1:14:29.460
(thunder rumbles)

1:14:29.460 --> 1:14:33.097
- A spade, a spade, for
and a shrouding sheet.

1:14:33.097 --> 1:14:33.930
Oh, ah.

1:14:37.780 --> 1:14:40.323
Pit of clay shall soon be made,

1:14:41.270 --> 1:14:46.030
for my newest guest to greet.

1:14:46.030 --> 1:14:50.790
Oh, ah.
- Whose grave is this?

1:14:50.790 --> 1:14:51.653
- Mine, sir.

1:14:55.920 --> 1:14:57.219
- I think it yours indeed.

1:14:58.180 --> 1:14:59.623
For you lie in it.

1:15:00.650 --> 1:15:03.420
- You lie outside it, sir.

1:15:03.420 --> 1:15:05.593
Therefore it is not yours.

1:15:08.750 --> 1:15:11.469
I do not lie in it.

1:15:11.469 --> 1:15:14.398
And yet it is mine.

1:15:14.398 --> 1:15:16.648
(laughing)

1:15:17.639 --> 1:15:18.590
- You do lie in it.

1:15:19.830 --> 1:15:21.503
To be in it and say it's yours.

1:15:26.719 --> 1:15:28.460
It's for the dead.

1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:30.973
- Therefore you lie for all eternity.

1:15:33.610 --> 1:15:37.723
- Only the dead lie for all eternity.

1:15:37.723 --> 1:15:40.223
(tense music)

1:15:44.930 --> 1:15:47.510
- What man did you dig it for?

1:15:47.510 --> 1:15:48.760
- No man, sir.

1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:49.990
- What woman then?

1:15:49.990 --> 1:15:51.170
- None neither.

1:15:51.170 --> 1:15:53.219
- Who is it to be buried in it?

1:15:53.219 --> 1:15:55.112
- One who was a woman,

1:15:56.280 --> 1:16:01.280
but knowingly drowned herself
and would have been denied

1:16:01.650 --> 1:16:04.210
Christian burial had
not she had been a lady

1:16:04.210 --> 1:16:06.723
of good birth and wealth.

1:16:18.010 --> 1:16:21.313
- How long have you been a grave maker?

1:16:25.150 --> 1:16:29.070
- Since the very first day
that the young Lord Hamlet

1:16:29.070 --> 1:16:33.293
was born, he that is mad,

1:16:35.221 --> 1:16:36.683
and been sent to England.

1:16:37.809 --> 1:16:39.680
- Why was he sent to England?

1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:40.763
- Because he was mad.

1:16:42.130 --> 1:16:45.032
He shall recoup his wits there.

1:16:46.190 --> 1:16:48.763
If not, it makes no difference there.

1:16:51.950 --> 1:16:53.059
- Why?

1:16:53.059 --> 1:16:58.059
- Because all the men
there are as mad as he is.

1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:03.653
- How did he become mad?

1:17:05.380 --> 1:17:07.340
- By losing his wits.

1:17:07.340 --> 1:17:08.850
- Upon what ground?

1:17:08.850 --> 1:17:13.733
- Upon these grounds
right here in Denmark.

1:17:17.861 --> 1:17:21.750
- How long will a man live
in the earth before he rots?

1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:27.420
- If he's not rotten before he dies...

1:17:31.040 --> 1:17:33.163
we have many of those nowadays,

1:17:35.430 --> 1:17:38.243
it may last eight or nine years.

1:17:46.180 --> 1:17:50.293
Here's a skull that's been
laying in the earth for many-

1:17:51.338 --> 1:17:52.779
(thunder cracks)

1:17:52.779 --> 1:17:53.612
Years.

1:17:54.570 --> 1:17:55.710
- Whose was it?

1:17:55.710 --> 1:17:57.083
- This very skull sir?

1:18:00.201 --> 1:18:01.034
Who do you think?

1:18:01.034 --> 1:18:02.670
- I do not know.

1:18:02.670 --> 1:18:05.790
- This very skull was Yorick's skull.

1:18:05.790 --> 1:18:09.898
The King's jester.

1:18:09.898 --> 1:18:12.232
(chuckling)

1:18:13.350 --> 1:18:14.362
- Sir Yorick.

1:18:16.190 --> 1:18:18.190
- This?
- Yes.

1:18:18.190 --> 1:18:20.120
- Alas, poor Yorick.

1:18:20.120 --> 1:18:21.950
I knew him well.

1:18:21.950 --> 1:18:26.950
Fellow of infinite
jokes, flights of fancy.

1:18:28.250 --> 1:18:33.250
He bore me on his back a thousand times.

1:18:33.350 --> 1:18:37.260
Here, upon those lips I kissed as a child.

1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:38.333
I know not how often.

1:18:45.250 --> 1:18:46.873
Where be your jibes now?

1:18:48.510 --> 1:18:52.583
Your songs, your flashes of merriment,

1:18:53.690 --> 1:18:55.193
that made the courts roar.

1:18:56.320 --> 1:18:58.549
(thunder rumbling)

1:18:58.549 --> 1:19:01.132
(solemn music)

1:19:18.340 --> 1:19:23.340
- Lay her in the earth and
from her fair unpolluted flesh,

1:19:25.990 --> 1:19:27.347
may violets spring.

1:19:33.050 --> 1:19:35.133
- Sweets to the sweet.

1:19:37.570 --> 1:19:38.403
Farewell.

1:19:41.740 --> 1:19:43.840
I hoped you would have been Hamlet's wife.

1:19:47.790 --> 1:19:48.623
- Ophelia.

1:19:51.809 --> 1:19:55.160
- Devil take your soul.
- I loved Ophelia.

1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:56.200
- Love?

1:19:56.200 --> 1:19:57.440
Love you call it?

1:19:57.440 --> 1:19:58.840
- Take Hamlet away, Horatio.

1:20:01.525 --> 1:20:05.120
And you Gertrude, watch your son closely.

1:20:07.019 --> 1:20:09.602
(solemn music)

1:20:21.570 --> 1:20:23.323
We'll bring an end to this shortly.

1:20:24.892 --> 1:20:27.642
(thunder cracks)

1:20:37.496 --> 1:20:39.820
(thunder cracks)

1:20:39.820 --> 1:20:44.820
- There's a divinity that
shapes all of our ends.

1:20:51.317 --> 1:20:53.567
(grunting)

1:20:59.070 --> 1:21:02.003
- You will lose the wager, my Lord.

1:21:03.309 --> 1:21:05.093
- I shall win.

1:21:07.430 --> 1:21:10.223
But you can't imagine how I feel inside.

1:21:11.100 --> 1:21:14.410
- I'm gonna tell the king
you're not fit to fence.

1:21:14.410 --> 1:21:15.623
- No, no, no, no.

1:21:16.650 --> 1:21:19.683
We defy fate.

1:21:25.370 --> 1:21:30.370
There is a special providence
in the fall of the sparrow.

1:21:32.530 --> 1:21:34.053
If it be now-

1:21:35.830 --> 1:21:39.120
- Then it's not to come.

1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:40.733
- And if it be yet to come-

1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:45.397
- It will be now.

1:21:45.397 --> 1:21:48.610
- And if it be not now-

1:21:48.610 --> 1:21:51.083
- Yet, it will come.

1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:53.213
- Be ready for it all.

1:21:54.480 --> 1:21:57.383
- [Both] Just let it be.

1:21:58.416 --> 1:22:01.166
(dramatic music)

1:22:09.350 --> 1:22:11.843
- Come Hamlet, come
and take Laertes' hand.

1:22:20.370 --> 1:22:23.593
- Forgive the utter
rashness of my actions.

1:22:25.200 --> 1:22:30.200
Excuse my madness and accept my love.

1:22:30.809 --> 1:22:35.809
- I do receive your love
and I will not wrong it.

1:22:39.594 --> 1:22:40.428
- You know the wager?

1:22:40.428 --> 1:22:41.440
- I do.

1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:44.719
- If you should get the
first or second hit,

1:22:44.719 --> 1:22:47.443
the king shall drink to
Hamlet's princely skill.

1:22:57.800 --> 1:22:58.633
- My Lords.

1:23:05.275 --> 1:23:06.459
Begin!

1:23:06.459 --> 1:23:08.709
(grunting)

1:23:14.496 --> 1:23:17.317
(chuckling)

1:23:17.317 --> 1:23:19.567
(grunting)

1:23:22.016 --> 1:23:23.710
(laughing)

1:23:23.710 --> 1:23:24.643
- A touch.

1:23:26.030 --> 1:23:26.862
- A hit.

1:23:28.335 --> 1:23:29.335
A very palpable hit.

1:23:30.175 --> 1:23:32.425
(clapping)

1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:35.833
- Come, again.

1:23:37.559 --> 1:23:38.393
- Wait.

1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:43.053
Hamlet, have a drink.

1:23:46.930 --> 1:23:48.123
Come, just a sip.

1:23:50.170 --> 1:23:51.833
- I'll play this bout first.

1:23:58.320 --> 1:23:59.603
Come, Laertes.

1:24:06.255 --> 1:24:07.680
- Begin!

1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:09.930
(grunting)

1:24:16.878 --> 1:24:17.710
(laughing)

1:24:17.710 --> 1:24:18.544
- Another hit!

1:24:19.741 --> 1:24:21.090
What say you?
- A touch, a touch,

1:24:21.090 --> 1:24:22.112
I do confess.

1:24:23.190 --> 1:24:25.490
(clapping)

1:24:25.490 --> 1:24:27.313
- Our son shall win.

1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:31.673
- The queen salutes her
son with all her heart.

1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:40.910
- I dare not drink yet, Mother.

1:24:42.559 --> 1:24:43.393
Wait a while.

1:24:47.290 --> 1:24:48.440
- To our son's victory.

1:24:50.597 --> 1:24:53.097
(tense music)

1:24:57.450 --> 1:24:59.963
- Come, for the third, Laertes.

1:25:02.275 --> 1:25:03.616
(tense music)

1:25:03.616 --> 1:25:06.366
(thunder cracks)

1:25:12.218 --> 1:25:14.468
(grunting)

1:25:21.877 --> 1:25:23.960
- What treachery is this?

1:25:28.715 --> 1:25:29.548
- My son.

1:25:30.635 --> 1:25:33.385
(dramatic music)

1:25:46.555 --> 1:25:47.388
Poison.

1:26:08.650 --> 1:26:09.993
- What treachery is this?

1:26:11.330 --> 1:26:12.163
- Hamlet.

1:26:14.930 --> 1:26:15.993
You are slain.

1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:23.139
No medicine in the world can save you now.

1:26:24.639 --> 1:26:27.563
The treacherous instrument
was in your hand.

1:26:32.380 --> 1:26:35.843
Unblunted and in venom,

1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:42.520
the foul device has now been turned on me.

1:26:48.602 --> 1:26:49.434
And I die too.

1:26:53.540 --> 1:26:57.913
I am justly killed by my own treachery.

1:27:02.740 --> 1:27:03.889
Your mother's poisoned.

1:27:07.984 --> 1:27:09.184
And the King's to blame.

1:27:10.186 --> 1:27:12.936
(dramatic music)

1:27:56.906 --> 1:27:58.489
- Follow my mother.

1:28:14.946 --> 1:28:17.112
(gasping)

1:28:18.885 --> 1:28:21.135
(shouting)

1:28:22.208 --> 1:28:24.958
(dramatic music)

1:28:50.782 --> 1:28:52.532
- Forgive me, Hamlet.

1:28:55.438 --> 1:28:57.938
(tense music)

1:29:32.463 --> 1:29:33.296
- My Lord.

1:29:36.253 --> 1:29:37.443
- I may be dead,

1:29:40.165 --> 1:29:41.115
but you'll live on.

1:29:53.910 --> 1:29:54.973
- Not for long.

1:30:00.590 --> 1:30:05.590
- If you ever did love me, do not do it.

1:30:12.130 --> 1:30:17.130
What's happened here
cannot be left unknown.

1:30:22.900 --> 1:30:26.303
Tell my story.

1:30:37.967 --> 1:30:39.634
The rest is silence.

1:30:52.965 --> 1:30:55.132
(sobbing)

1:31:26.485 --> 1:31:29.068
(gentle music)

1:31:39.337 --> 1:31:42.680
- [Horatio] Let me speak
to the yet unknowing world,

1:31:42.680 --> 1:31:44.282
how these things came about.

1:31:46.860 --> 1:31:49.000
Bloody and unnatural acts

1:31:50.750 --> 1:31:54.170
of deaths brought on by
evil, cunning and deceit,

1:31:54.170 --> 1:31:57.130
all this will I truly tell.

1:32:00.901 --> 1:32:03.401
(tense music)

1:33:30.771 --> 1:33:33.353
(gentle music)

1:35:46.796 --> 1:35:49.879
(gentle piano music)
