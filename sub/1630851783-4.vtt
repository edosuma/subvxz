00:07.300 --> 00:10.260
Simon Walden.
Single stab wound to the chest.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.260
No witnesses, no motive.

00:12.260 --> 00:15.260
I'm pregnant.
Simon's?

00:15.260 --> 00:16.260
Who else would it be?

00:16.260 --> 00:18.460
What do you know about Alfie?
Seems like a lovely guy.

00:18.460 --> 00:21.940
I mean, is Lucy capable
of consenting to a relationship?

00:21.940 --> 00:25.260
Well, I'd say yes.
Did you know about them, Jon?

00:25.260 --> 00:27.260
He came out after me.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.260
Next thing I know,
he's pushing me up against the wall.

00:30.260 --> 00:33.260
I know about Rosa.
What you did was a crime.

00:33.260 --> 00:36.260
Was Simon helping someone else
apart from Rosa?

00:36.260 --> 00:40.780
He said no-one should be
frightened all the time.

00:44.260 --> 00:47.100
Take your coat off
and go back to bed

00:47.100 --> 00:49.260
right... now.

00:49.260 --> 00:53.260
He's a coercive,
bullying narcissist,

00:53.260 --> 00:55.260
and he has used your church
for his own ego.

00:55.260 --> 00:58.780
He stands by us... He treats
his wife like his property!

00:58.780 --> 01:00.260
You don't understand
normal marriage.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.940
Simon Walden came to the Brethren
to help Rosa,

01:02.940 --> 01:06.260
but I think he saw someone else
there who needed his help even more,

01:06.260 --> 01:09.100
that he wanted to help you
escape Dennis.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.260
Help me and I'll help you,
I promise.

02:05.260 --> 02:08.260
'I thought I was feeling better.'

02:11.260 --> 02:14.260
It's like...

02:14.260 --> 02:20.260
my thoughts just...
won't behave themselves.

02:21.260 --> 02:23.460
I thought you might
give me something.

02:25.260 --> 02:27.260
Stronger tablets, maybe?

02:31.260 --> 02:35.260
And... these therapies
you mentioned...

02:36.260 --> 02:39.260
..our church doesn't really go in
for that sort of thing.

02:41.260 --> 02:45.260
And your family?
Are they supportive?

02:45.260 --> 02:47.260
Your husband?

02:48.260 --> 02:51.260
I shouldn't have wasted your time.

03:25.260 --> 03:29.100
We have statements from both
Lucy Craddle and Rosa Shapland,

03:29.100 --> 03:31.260
that on the 15th of March
of this year,

03:31.260 --> 03:34.260
you sexually assaulted Rosa
at the Woodyard day centre.

03:34.260 --> 03:36.260
No comment.
I'm not asking for a comment.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.260
I'm giving you the facts.

03:40.260 --> 03:43.260
What we're interested in
is Simon Walden's murder.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.260
I... I don't know anything about it.

03:47.260 --> 03:50.260
We know Simon Walden was there
the night of the assault.

03:50.260 --> 03:55.260
He saw what happened, didn't he?
You were drunk... upset.

03:57.780 --> 04:00.460
You talked to Walden.

04:06.260 --> 04:08.260
He'd come outside to smoke.

04:09.620 --> 04:13.260
He helped Rosa call her family.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.260
He could see
that I was feeling like shit,

04:15.260 --> 04:18.260
so we just sat and talked.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.260
She hadn't said no.

04:21.260 --> 04:25.260
I know she was drunk, but I hadn't
thought it was that bad.

04:26.260 --> 04:27.300
It was.

04:27.300 --> 04:31.100
You sent private messages
to Walden afterwards,

04:31.100 --> 04:33.940
asking him not to tell anyone.

04:39.260 --> 04:40.260
When did you find out

04:40.260 --> 04:43.260
that he'd recorded
your conversations on his phone?

04:44.260 --> 04:47.260
Is that why you asked Rosa
to show you where the chalet was?

04:47.260 --> 04:48.300
So you could search for the phone?

04:48.300 --> 04:51.100
Because you hadn't found it
that morning,

04:51.100 --> 04:53.260
when you killed him.
No, no, I...

04:56.940 --> 05:00.260
OK... I did go to the chalet.

05:00.260 --> 05:02.260
I knew that Simon and Gaby
went there.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.260
Caz told me
you hadn't found his phone,

05:05.260 --> 05:08.260
and I needed to find it first,
but that's all. I...

05:08.260 --> 05:10.260
I had nothing to do
with Simon's death,

05:10.260 --> 05:12.260
I don't know what happened to him.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.260
You left Rosa
bleeding and unconscious.

05:14.260 --> 05:17.260
That was an accident!
She followed me.

05:17.260 --> 05:20.260
She was freaking out
and she fell and hit her head.

05:24.620 --> 05:28.940
You told DS Rafferty
you left your old job in London

05:28.940 --> 05:32.260
because you wanted
a... new kind of life.

05:32.260 --> 05:34.260
I called your ex-employer.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.260
The accountancy firm.

05:36.260 --> 05:41.260
They told me you were fired
for sexually harassing an intern.

05:41.260 --> 05:44.260
The firm had managed to convince her
not to take it any further,

05:44.260 --> 05:46.260
on the condition
that you left the industry.

05:50.260 --> 05:52.100
You must've been desperate

05:52.100 --> 05:54.460
for Caroline not to find out
what kind of guy you really are.

05:58.260 --> 06:01.260
I asked Simon not to say anything.

06:01.260 --> 06:03.260
But that's it.

06:03.260 --> 06:06.300
I don't know anything
about his death.

06:15.260 --> 06:18.100
We know that Rose and Lucy
came to you with an allegation.

06:19.260 --> 06:21.300
That you did nothing.

06:21.300 --> 06:25.260
I went to see her family.
Dennis Stephenson.

06:25.260 --> 06:30.460
He said there'd been
a misunderstanding.

06:30.460 --> 06:33.260
We didn't see how involving
the police would help anyone.

06:33.260 --> 06:37.260
Did you speak to Ed?
He said he'd made a pass.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.940
Got it wrong.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.260
Well, we've all been there,
in our youth.

06:43.300 --> 06:46.260
Ed's being charged
with attempted rape.

06:49.260 --> 06:52.260
Tell us about the, erm,
nondisclosure agreement

06:52.260 --> 06:55.260
you asked Simon Walden to sign.
Er...

06:55.260 --> 06:58.260
I asked him to sign it,
he refused. That's it.

06:59.940 --> 07:02.260
And that's what
you had the row about?

07:04.260 --> 07:07.260
Have you found his killer yet?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.260
We're getting close.

07:16.260 --> 07:17.940
Matthew?

07:19.300 --> 07:22.260
I'll, er, meet you in the car, boss.

07:22.260 --> 07:24.260
Didn't hear you come home
last night...

07:24.260 --> 07:27.260
or leave this morning.

07:27.260 --> 07:30.260
Did you know about the allegation
that Rosa had made?

07:32.260 --> 07:33.460
What?

07:33.460 --> 07:36.260
You didn't turn a blind eye...

07:36.260 --> 07:38.460
like you did with Lucy
and Alfie, did you?

07:47.300 --> 07:50.940
'I don't know when we will be
able to have a funeral for Simon.'

07:50.940 --> 07:53.260
Or where we'd have it.

07:55.620 --> 07:59.940
The only thing I have is...
your church.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.260
I, erm...

08:05.260 --> 08:07.260
I was wondering if...

08:09.260 --> 08:11.260
..I came to a service,

08:11.260 --> 08:15.260
if you could say some prayers
for him.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.460
You're in a lot of pain,
aren't you, Gaby?

08:19.460 --> 08:22.260
Would you like to talk about it?

08:25.260 --> 08:28.940
You have any family here in Devon?

08:28.940 --> 08:33.260
Just my mum in London.
She's a bit... erratic.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.260
She know about the baby?

08:39.100 --> 08:40.260
Hm...

08:42.260 --> 08:45.260
I've told you
a little about our church.

08:45.260 --> 08:47.940
But one of the main things

08:47.940 --> 08:52.260
is that we leave the outside world
behind at the door.

08:52.260 --> 08:55.260
Anything the world
might judge you for,

08:55.260 --> 08:58.260
anything that you might
feel ashamed of...

09:00.100 --> 09:02.260
..cast it off like old clothes.

09:02.260 --> 09:08.260
Get a brand-new skin,
like a little newborn baby.

09:09.260 --> 09:12.260
Are there things
that you feel ashamed of, Gaby?

09:15.260 --> 09:19.620
World's a brutal place,
tears people to shreds.

09:19.620 --> 09:23.260
Forces them to do things
that they're not proud of.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.260
Everything in my life,
I've screwed up.

09:26.260 --> 09:29.260
These mistakes...

09:29.260 --> 09:33.100
they brought you here... to us.

09:35.260 --> 09:38.780
They have swept away
your transgressions like a cloud,

09:38.780 --> 09:41.260
your sins like the morning mist.

09:41.260 --> 09:45.260
Return to me,
for I have redeemed you.

09:47.940 --> 09:53.260
..need to be called
because I persecuted church...

09:57.260 --> 10:00.260
Grace?

10:01.260 --> 10:04.260
Sorry. Sorry.

10:04.260 --> 10:07.780
Shall I get you some water?
I don't want to make a fuss.

10:07.780 --> 10:11.260
I just need to go home
and rest for a while.

10:11.260 --> 10:15.260
Well, I'll drive you.
No, no, no, no, you're needed here.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.260
I'll be back at lunchtime
to check on you.

10:34.260 --> 10:37.260
'Do you think Ed or Christopher
killed Simon?'

10:37.260 --> 10:39.940
Both of them have motive.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.780
Both of them were desperate to stop
Walden exposing what they'd done.

10:45.260 --> 10:46.780
I dunno.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.300
Is everything OK?

10:53.300 --> 10:55.260
With Jonathan.

10:57.260 --> 10:59.260
Yeah, it's fine.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.260
Hello?

11:26.100 --> 11:27.260
'Grace?'

11:32.260 --> 11:34.260
'Grace, is that you?'

11:44.260 --> 11:46.260
Tell me about Simon Walden.

11:48.260 --> 11:51.260
He was one of those people
who could...

11:53.620 --> 11:56.260
..see things.

11:56.260 --> 11:57.300
Like you.

11:57.300 --> 12:02.260
He saw something in us.
In the church.

12:02.260 --> 12:06.260
The possibility of what it could be.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.260
Without Dennis.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.260
Tell me about
what Dennis does to you.

12:20.260 --> 12:21.460
He never hits me.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.260
I almost used to wish he would.

12:31.260 --> 12:33.260
'The pain would be easier...'
Promise...

12:33.260 --> 12:36.260
..than the fear.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.260
How long has it been happening?

12:41.260 --> 12:43.620
Since the day we met.

12:43.620 --> 12:48.260
I was 19, running away from London.

12:48.260 --> 12:52.460
Came here to... clear my head.

12:52.460 --> 12:55.260
By the sea.

12:55.260 --> 12:58.260
And he was the first person...

13:00.260 --> 13:02.260
..who ever really...

13:04.260 --> 13:06.260
..listened to me.

13:09.260 --> 13:11.620
He was listening, all right.

13:14.260 --> 13:18.100
To find out where the cracks were.

13:18.940 --> 13:22.260
I thought I must've deserved it...

13:22.260 --> 13:25.260
for him to be like that.

13:25.260 --> 13:27.260
And then...

13:27.260 --> 13:30.260
it got so it was just...

13:37.260 --> 13:39.260
..normal.

13:42.260 --> 13:45.260
Did Dennis find out
that Simon wanted to help you?

13:46.260 --> 13:47.780
To get away from him?

13:52.260 --> 13:56.260
Simon was a good man.

13:56.260 --> 13:58.260
What happened to him, Grace?

14:02.260 --> 14:04.260
Was it Dennis?

14:04.260 --> 14:06.260
I think maybe Dennis killed him

14:06.260 --> 14:08.260
and you're too scared
to say anything.

14:09.260 --> 14:12.260
Help me get justice for Simon.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.260
And for you.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.260
What are you doing home?

14:22.260 --> 14:25.260
Didn't you have double maths
this morning?

14:29.300 --> 14:33.100
Well, I know how hard
you've been working recently.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.260
Ella!

14:35.260 --> 14:39.260
You should not be
clearing up after me.

14:40.260 --> 14:43.780
Do you ever regret having kids?

14:44.620 --> 14:49.260
Like, your life would probably be
a lot better if you didn't.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.260
D'you think that's why
I work so much?

14:55.260 --> 14:57.260
Come here.

14:58.260 --> 15:03.260
There are many things I regret
about my relationship with your dad,

15:03.260 --> 15:09.780
but you and Ben are not one of them.
OK?

15:11.260 --> 15:13.260
Come here.

15:16.260 --> 15:18.780
Ugh, sorry!

15:21.940 --> 15:23.260
Boss?

15:23.260 --> 15:25.260
'I need you back at the station,
now.'

15:27.260 --> 15:29.260
Erm...

15:37.260 --> 15:40.940
We're going to need you
to make a statement. A formal one.

15:42.260 --> 15:45.620
We have a warrant
to search Dennis' property.

15:46.940 --> 15:50.260
If we can gather enough evidence
to charge him,

15:50.260 --> 15:54.260
he'll be remanded in custody
and you can go home.

15:54.260 --> 15:58.780
Until then, we'll arrange
somewhere safe for you to stay.

15:58.780 --> 16:01.780
How long will I have to stay?

16:03.260 --> 16:06.780
Well, that depends how quickly
we can get enough evidence.

16:09.260 --> 16:12.100
And if you don't?

16:12.100 --> 16:14.260
Then your statement becomes
even more important.

16:15.260 --> 16:20.260
We need everything you know
about Dennis and Simon Walden.

16:20.260 --> 16:24.260
Anything that might help us prove
that Dennis killed him.

16:25.940 --> 16:29.260
Including his behaviour towards you.

16:29.260 --> 16:32.260
And will that be enough
to charge him?

16:33.260 --> 16:36.260
And... keep him here?

16:38.100 --> 16:39.300
I hope so.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.620
What if it's not?
I know he did it, Grace.

16:45.460 --> 16:47.260
Together, we're going to prove it.

16:58.260 --> 17:02.260
He keeps going... to his shed.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.260
Boss?

17:35.100 --> 17:38.260
Can you tell me how this phone
came into your possession, Dennis?

17:39.260 --> 17:42.260
Oh, yeah, I found it here last week.

17:42.260 --> 17:44.260
It's registered to Simon Walden.

17:44.260 --> 17:47.260
Well, I suppose
he must've left it here.

17:47.260 --> 17:52.260
How did you feel about his interest
in your church?

17:53.260 --> 17:58.260
Well...
I could see that he needed God.

17:58.260 --> 18:00.940
He needed freedom.

18:00.940 --> 18:02.460
I'm sorry, "freedom"?

18:02.460 --> 18:06.260
From all the lies
your world tells, Matthew.

18:06.260 --> 18:09.260
From its false promises,

18:09.260 --> 18:13.260
the infinite choice
that isn't choice at all.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.100
So, you offered him a new life?

18:17.100 --> 18:20.260
We offered him what we offer
everybody - a Bible

18:20.260 --> 18:24.260
and a chance to commit your life
to something bigger than yourself.

18:25.260 --> 18:29.780
I see how lonely people are,
Matthew.

18:29.780 --> 18:33.260
This terrible struggle
to find something,

18:33.260 --> 18:36.780
anything that has meaning.

18:39.260 --> 18:43.260
Must've made you so... angry

18:43.260 --> 18:46.260
that he saw through you.
Through me?

18:46.260 --> 18:50.260
Your life's not about God, Dennis.

18:50.260 --> 18:51.620
It's about your ego.

18:51.620 --> 18:54.260
And Simon Walden saw that.

18:54.260 --> 18:56.460
He saw a chance to redeem himself

18:56.460 --> 19:00.100
by helping the people
who suffered because of you.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.620
Is this because
you're upset about your mother?

19:02.620 --> 19:07.260
It's got nothing to do with me.
It's about Simon... and Rosa.

19:07.260 --> 19:10.260
And Grace?

19:12.260 --> 19:15.260
Is there anyone
who's not a member of this church

19:15.260 --> 19:18.260
who can confirm your alibi for
the morning of Simon Walden's death?

19:18.260 --> 19:19.940
No.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.260
Dennis Stephenson, I'm arresting you

19:23.260 --> 19:25.260
on suspicion of the murder
of Simon Walden.

19:25.260 --> 19:28.780
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

19:28.780 --> 19:30.260
'if you do not mention
when questioned

19:30.260 --> 19:32.260
'something you later rely on
in court.'

19:38.260 --> 19:40.460
I want to see my wife.
I know you've got her here.

19:40.460 --> 19:42.460
Why can't I see her?

19:42.460 --> 19:45.260
I need to see my wife!
Are you listening to me?!

19:45.260 --> 19:48.260
I need to see my wife!
Grace?!

19:48.260 --> 19:51.260
..for only you, Lord,
make me dwell in safety.

19:51.260 --> 19:54.260
In peace, I will lie down and sleep,
for only you, Lord, make me...

20:00.460 --> 20:04.260
It was all Dennis.
Mum, coming here...

20:04.260 --> 20:06.780
meeting you.

20:09.260 --> 20:12.260
He convinced her
that he could convert me back.

20:14.260 --> 20:16.260
He wanted me back onside.

20:19.260 --> 20:23.260
Maybe some of it was him.

20:23.260 --> 20:25.260
Not all of it.

20:27.260 --> 20:30.260
I mean, come on,
your mum was trying.

20:30.260 --> 20:33.260
That wasn't fake, like,
she really did try.

20:33.260 --> 20:35.460
She thinks that we're sinners.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.260
That I'm going to hell.

20:39.260 --> 20:42.260
It's-It's not long, you know,
since most people thought that.

20:45.260 --> 20:49.260
But the world has changed.
It's changed fast.

20:49.260 --> 20:52.260
She might never accept us.

20:52.260 --> 20:55.260
I know that you don't think
that I say it.

20:55.260 --> 20:59.260
That little Brethren boy...
with his doubts...

21:00.260 --> 21:03.260
..who's just waiting for it
to all go wrong...

21:05.780 --> 21:08.260
..who can't even
hold my hand in public...

21:10.260 --> 21:12.260
..because he still carries around
the shame

21:12.260 --> 21:13.260
that his mother taught him.

21:15.940 --> 21:17.780
And that's why you needed
to come back here.

21:19.260 --> 21:24.100
Because even after you were
so brave in getting out,

21:24.100 --> 21:26.260
part of you still felt that shame.

21:27.940 --> 21:32.260
And you thought that if she could
just see who you are now...

21:34.260 --> 21:37.260
..if she could just give you
her blessing,

21:37.260 --> 21:39.260
then you mightn't feel that
any more.

21:39.260 --> 21:45.260
And maybe what you really need
is to just let it go.

21:45.260 --> 21:48.260
Can you?

21:49.460 --> 21:51.940
I don't know.

21:56.460 --> 21:59.260
I don't know.

22:05.260 --> 22:08.260
Thank you for agreeing to this.

22:11.260 --> 22:14.300
I really did think
Rosa had got it wrong.

22:14.300 --> 22:18.260
You thought she'd made it up?
I thought she'd misinterpreted.

22:18.260 --> 22:22.940
They were both drunk.
She didn't tell him to stop.

22:24.260 --> 22:28.260
What Ed did was... ungentlemanly.

22:28.260 --> 22:29.260
That doesn't make it a crime.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.260
What makes it a crime
is that she didn't consent to it.

22:32.260 --> 22:34.260
I know.

22:35.260 --> 22:37.260
Could've handled it better.

22:38.260 --> 22:41.260
You did it with Mum
and you're doing it now -

22:41.260 --> 22:43.620
saving your own skin
and fuck the rest of us.

22:43.620 --> 22:48.260
What? We both know Mum would still
be alive if it wasn't for you.

22:48.260 --> 22:52.260
No, Carol...
You drove us drunk, you killed her.

22:52.260 --> 22:54.260
And then you manipulated everything
to save yourself,

22:54.260 --> 22:57.300
just like you always do.
That night, I wasn't drinking.

23:00.260 --> 23:02.260
Your mum was...

23:02.260 --> 23:04.260
seriously ill at the time.

23:04.260 --> 23:07.260
She was very depressed.

23:07.260 --> 23:10.260
Don't make this out to be her fault.

23:10.260 --> 23:12.260
You were asleep in the back.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.780
We were arguing.

23:14.780 --> 23:17.260
She grabbed the steering wheel.

23:18.780 --> 23:20.940
We went into the tree.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.260
That was it.

23:25.460 --> 23:29.460
No... she didn't.

23:29.460 --> 23:32.100
I'm so sorry.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.940
Why didn't you tell me?

23:36.260 --> 23:39.260
Your heart was already broken.

23:40.260 --> 23:42.260
I only ever wanted to protect you.

24:05.260 --> 24:07.780
Jen?
'Sir, the CCTV shows Dennis'

24:07.780 --> 24:10.260
heading to the funeral
before the time of the murder,

24:10.260 --> 24:11.260
coming back 10am, just like he said.

24:11.260 --> 24:14.620
'His solicitor is saying
we have to release him now.'

24:14.620 --> 24:16.260
What about Walden's phone?

24:16.260 --> 24:18.260
No blood traces,
not enough to charge.

24:18.260 --> 24:21.260
Does Grace know he's being released?

24:21.260 --> 24:23.260
'I'm afraid so, sir. She's gone.'

24:51.260 --> 24:53.260
Time to go home, my love.

24:56.260 --> 24:58.100
Come on.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.260
Shit.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.100
Dennis Stephenson had motive.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.260
Simon Walden was helping his wife
report him for domestic abuse.

25:44.260 --> 25:48.260
He had means. We found Walden's
phone hidden in his shed!

25:48.260 --> 25:50.260
Yeah, but no sign
of the murder weapon, though.

25:50.260 --> 25:52.260
Why keep the phone
but not the knife?

25:54.260 --> 25:56.260
OK, is it possible Dennis
was working with someone?

25:56.260 --> 26:00.260
Ed Raveley or Christopher Reasley?

26:00.260 --> 26:02.260
A conspiracy to silence Walden

26:02.260 --> 26:04.260
because he was trying
to expose them.

26:04.260 --> 26:06.260
One of them could have been
at Crow Point

26:06.260 --> 26:09.260
while Dennis was at the funeral
establishing an alibi.

26:11.260 --> 26:13.260
It's possible, yeah.

26:13.260 --> 26:15.260
If it was Dennis,
someone must have helped him.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.260
Where are you going, sir?

26:21.260 --> 26:24.780
To talk to someone who can
lead me to the killer.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.260
I think Dennis killed Simon Walden

27:11.260 --> 27:14.260
and I think YOU can help
me understand how.

27:15.260 --> 27:19.260
Matthew, I've lost everything.
I've lost my husband, my son.

27:19.260 --> 27:23.260
You want to take my church away too?
Dennis isn't your church, Mum.

27:24.260 --> 27:26.260
Well...

27:27.260 --> 27:29.260
It will be a better
place without him and...

27:30.620 --> 27:32.260
And you didn't lose your son.

27:33.300 --> 27:36.260
You didn't want him.

27:36.260 --> 27:38.260
You made me choose...

27:38.260 --> 27:40.260
between you and God.

27:44.940 --> 27:48.260
I told myself it was...
it was some sort of test.

27:49.260 --> 27:53.260
You know, like Abraham and Isaac.
Prepared to...

27:55.260 --> 27:57.260
..sacrifice his only son

27:57.260 --> 28:01.100
because his love for God
was greater than any worldly bond.

28:01.100 --> 28:05.940
I asked myself every day
if I made the right choice.

28:07.260 --> 28:09.260
And I still don't know if I did.

28:11.260 --> 28:14.100
What a cruel bastard your God is.

28:14.100 --> 28:17.940
God is pure love!

28:19.300 --> 28:24.300
And you were raised in it
and you chose to turn away!

28:24.300 --> 28:29.260
No, no, I was raised...
I was raised in fear and shame.

28:29.260 --> 28:30.940
I was raised to despise myself.

28:32.260 --> 28:35.260
I know it's what you believe.

28:35.260 --> 28:39.260
I know that you didn't mean to,
or maybe you didn't see what I was,

28:39.260 --> 28:40.940
or even admit it to yourself,

28:40.940 --> 28:43.260
because I did a very good job
of hiding it.

28:44.260 --> 28:45.940
Mum...

28:47.260 --> 28:50.260
If I could have turned
myself straight,

28:50.260 --> 28:52.260
I would have.

28:52.260 --> 28:56.260
If I could have taken a pill,
or if the praying had worked...

28:56.260 --> 29:00.460
Even after I left, I spent years
just hiding myself, just working,

29:00.460 --> 29:04.260
doing everything I could to be good,
to redeem myself.

29:04.260 --> 29:09.260
And it was sad and it was lonely
and I spent years like that.

29:14.260 --> 29:15.940
And then...

29:17.620 --> 29:21.260
Then I met Jonathan.

29:21.260 --> 29:25.260
And he showed me that I didn't
have to be scared all the time

29:25.260 --> 29:29.260
of people seeing who I really am.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.780
That I can be loved.

29:38.260 --> 29:40.260
No, Mum...
Matthew, please.

29:41.300 --> 29:44.780
..tell me about the morning
of the funeral.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.260
Where's Grace?

30:31.260 --> 30:32.460
I need to see her, Dennis.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.260
She's very fragile, Matthew.

30:41.260 --> 30:42.260
I know what you did, Dennis.

30:42.260 --> 30:45.260
You've been controlling
everyone for years.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.260
Get out of my house.

30:47.260 --> 30:49.260
Get out...

30:49.260 --> 30:51.260
of my house!

30:54.620 --> 30:57.260
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30:59.260 --> 31:04.940
After everything I've done for you.
I treated you like a son.

31:04.940 --> 31:08.260
I did more for you than
your own father ever did.

31:08.260 --> 31:10.260
Grace!

31:58.260 --> 32:01.260
I found this in your shed.

32:01.260 --> 32:04.260
Before the police could get to it.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.260
You couldn't resist keeping it,
could you?

32:11.260 --> 32:15.260
As a reminder
of your control over me.

32:15.260 --> 32:18.260
Put the knife down, Grace.

32:18.260 --> 32:21.260
You convinced me...

32:22.260 --> 32:27.260
..that I was so... utterly pathetic.

32:27.260 --> 32:30.260
I only ever tried to help you,
Grace.

32:30.260 --> 32:32.460
That's what they all thought!

32:32.460 --> 32:35.260
So loving.

32:36.260 --> 32:40.100
None of them knew the truth.

32:43.260 --> 32:47.260
You controlled my life

32:47.260 --> 32:51.260
for 45 years!

32:52.260 --> 32:55.260
I couldn't leave the house,
couldn't spend any money,

32:55.260 --> 32:57.260
couldn't go anywhere, do anything

32:57.260 --> 33:01.260
without the threats
and the black moods.

33:01.260 --> 33:02.260
I never hit you, Grace.

33:02.260 --> 33:04.260
You didn't have to.

33:06.620 --> 33:10.260
The fear I felt.

33:11.260 --> 33:16.940
All these years, fearing you!

33:20.260 --> 33:26.260
Well, I should have
done this years ago.

33:26.260 --> 33:28.260
Jesus!

33:30.260 --> 33:34.260
Maybe it was worth the wait,

33:34.260 --> 33:38.260
to see the look on your face.

33:38.260 --> 33:41.260
You're scared of me.

33:41.260 --> 33:44.260
YOU'RE scared of ME.

33:44.260 --> 33:47.100
And so you should be.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.300
Grace!

33:48.300 --> 33:50.780
Drop the knife.

33:52.260 --> 33:55.620
Grace Stephenson, I'm arresting you
on the suspicion

33:55.620 --> 33:57.260
of the murder of Simon Walden.

34:12.940 --> 34:17.260
For the tape, the defendant has
refused the duty solicitor.

34:17.260 --> 34:19.260
Tell us what you did, Grace.

34:23.260 --> 34:27.260
I stabbed Simon Walden...

34:27.260 --> 34:29.260
and he died.

34:31.260 --> 34:34.260
It was the morning
of your father's funeral.

34:34.260 --> 34:38.260
I knew I wouldn't be missed
if I slipped away for an hour.

34:43.260 --> 34:46.260
One of the benefits
of being invisible.

34:49.260 --> 34:53.780
Had you arranged to meet him
that morning at Crow Point?

34:53.780 --> 34:57.260
He said he...
he was going to meet Lucy there.

34:59.100 --> 35:02.260
And that they were going
to go to the police.

35:02.260 --> 35:06.300
To report Edward Raveley
for his misconduct at the Woodyard?

35:09.620 --> 35:12.260
Why did you kill him, Grace?

35:13.260 --> 35:17.260
He was trying to help you
escape an abusive marriage.

35:18.780 --> 35:22.300
Did Dennis tell you to kill Simon?

35:28.100 --> 35:30.260
Did he make you do it?

35:32.260 --> 35:35.260
I did this.

35:35.260 --> 35:38.260
I have to own it.

35:38.260 --> 35:40.260
There is a name for what
Dennis does to you.

35:40.260 --> 35:42.260
Coercive control.

35:43.260 --> 35:47.260
He has broken you
down systematically.

35:49.260 --> 35:51.260
If you help us,

35:51.260 --> 35:56.260
we can show Dennis solicited you
to commit Simon's murder.

35:56.260 --> 36:02.260
You don't...
have to protect him any more.

36:02.260 --> 36:06.260
I'm not protecting him.

36:09.620 --> 36:14.620
I won't stand in the dock
next to that man.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.300
I'll face this on my own.

36:23.300 --> 36:27.100
I know that Dennis
manipulated her to kill Simon

36:27.100 --> 36:29.260
and he's gonna get away with it.

36:29.260 --> 36:32.260
The grooming, gaslighting,
whatever you want to call it.

36:33.260 --> 36:36.260
He has... total control over Grace.

36:38.260 --> 36:40.940
But she'll never speak out.

36:40.940 --> 36:43.260
It's what happens with
the Borum Brethren.

36:45.260 --> 36:47.260
What's gonna happen
to the Brethren now, do you think?

36:49.260 --> 36:52.260
Well, they'll, erm...

36:52.260 --> 36:54.260
They'll carry on growing
their vegetables...

36:56.100 --> 37:01.260
..while waiting for God
to swoop them up and...

37:02.260 --> 37:04.260
..watch the rest of us burn.

37:07.260 --> 37:08.260
Yeah.

37:12.260 --> 37:15.260
I kinda see why Simon was into it,
though.

37:18.260 --> 37:22.260
That thing of...
totally belonging somewhere.

37:24.260 --> 37:26.260
I never had that.

37:26.260 --> 37:29.260
Probably never will.

37:30.300 --> 37:32.260
You do.

37:36.260 --> 37:38.260
Oh, I...

37:39.260 --> 37:41.260
I don't know about that.

37:52.260 --> 37:53.260
Here.

37:57.260 --> 38:00.260
I'm gonna tell my dad
to sell this place.

38:00.260 --> 38:02.260
Or find new tenants.

38:06.100 --> 38:08.300
It's not his fault, what Ed did.

38:08.300 --> 38:12.260
He's not a bad man,
your dad, he just...

38:12.260 --> 38:14.780
wants you to love him
and knows you don't.

38:14.780 --> 38:17.260
Not really.

38:20.260 --> 38:24.100
Did you mean what you said,
about helping me?

38:24.100 --> 38:26.260
With the baby?

38:28.260 --> 38:30.620
Cos I'm really,
really gonna need it.

38:30.620 --> 38:33.100
Yeah, you are!

38:37.260 --> 38:39.260
Right, you lot, who's hungry?

38:39.260 --> 38:41.620
Me.
I am making roast chicken.

38:41.620 --> 38:44.260
All the trimmings...
Mum, it's getting a bit late.

38:45.260 --> 38:48.260
Right.

38:48.260 --> 38:52.260
Yeah, maybe lunch tomorrow?
Chinese?

38:52.260 --> 38:53.780
Mm!

38:53.780 --> 38:56.260
Yeah, go on, then.

38:56.260 --> 39:00.260
Case is over, then?
Yeah. Yeah.

39:03.780 --> 39:05.460
Will you...

39:05.460 --> 39:08.260
promise me you'll always...

39:08.260 --> 39:11.260
always, like, tell me stuff?
Yeah. Yeah?

39:13.940 --> 39:16.260
You'll always talk to me.

39:16.260 --> 39:17.260
Yeah?

39:18.260 --> 39:20.260
Want your usual?

39:20.260 --> 39:24.260
Oh, yes, come on.
Crispy chilli beef...

39:28.260 --> 39:29.940
You're too trusting

39:29.940 --> 39:32.260
to see what's really going on.

39:32.260 --> 39:34.260
'You're scared of him,
aren't you, Grace?'

39:34.260 --> 39:35.260
'I'm fragile, Matthew.'

39:35.260 --> 39:37.260
Do you understand what I'm saying?

39:37.260 --> 39:39.260
Go back to bed right...

39:39.260 --> 39:41.260
now.

39:41.260 --> 39:43.460
I couldn't help you then
but I can help you now.

39:43.460 --> 39:45.260
If you talk to me.

39:45.260 --> 39:48.260
Grace, help me and I'll help you,
I promise.

40:09.260 --> 40:13.260
He told me that I was being...
naive.

40:13.260 --> 40:16.260
That Simon was only helping me...

40:16.260 --> 40:20.260
to get Dennis out.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.260
So he can take my place....

40:24.260 --> 40:26.260
In the church.

40:26.260 --> 40:31.260
Do you understand what I'm saying?
We can not let him do that.

40:31.260 --> 40:34.260
I believed him.

40:35.260 --> 40:38.300
I started to think about...

40:38.300 --> 40:42.260
how stupid I'd been.

40:42.260 --> 40:45.260
Daring to hope.

40:47.260 --> 40:49.260
To trust someone.

40:54.260 --> 40:58.260
Dennis said I'd put
the whole church in danger.

41:02.260 --> 41:05.100
And that there was only...
One way...

41:06.260 --> 41:09.260
..to make it right.

41:09.260 --> 41:11.620
To kill Simon.

41:13.260 --> 41:20.260
Dennis had made me hear
what he wanted me to hear.

41:24.260 --> 41:27.260
That's the thing about fear.

41:32.460 --> 41:34.260
It makes you...

41:37.260 --> 41:39.260
..so...

41:41.780 --> 41:43.260
..weak.

41:58.260 --> 42:00.260
I don't blame you for this, Matthew.

42:00.260 --> 42:03.260
Dennis Stephenson,

42:03.260 --> 42:06.260
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of soliciting the murder...

42:21.260 --> 42:23.260
That Alfie?

42:25.260 --> 42:26.780
How is he?

42:28.260 --> 42:31.260
Applying for a new job
at the carwash.

42:33.260 --> 42:35.260
You know...

42:36.300 --> 42:39.260
..if you want to invite him
over sometimes,

42:39.260 --> 42:44.260
or someone else,
that'd be all right.

42:44.260 --> 42:45.460
It's not about that, Dad.

42:45.460 --> 42:47.260
I know.

42:49.260 --> 42:51.940
I know I haven't always
treated you...

42:51.940 --> 42:56.260
as I should have, as a grown woman.

42:57.260 --> 43:01.260
But I...
I made a promise to your mother

43:01.260 --> 43:03.260
that I'd look after you.

43:05.260 --> 43:08.260
Soon enough, I won't be able to.

43:08.260 --> 43:11.260
And that scares me witless.

43:11.260 --> 43:15.260
Who'll look after you then, maid?
Me.

43:20.260 --> 43:27.260
We're here to give thanks for the
life of our brother, Simon Walden.

43:27.260 --> 43:32.260
And I know it's strange
to see me up here.

43:32.260 --> 43:37.260
I don't know whether I should be
speaking like this.

43:37.260 --> 43:38.260
But...

43:41.260 --> 43:43.260
Well, I am.

43:43.260 --> 43:45.260
Now.

43:47.100 --> 43:51.260
I know how easy it is
to say nothing,

43:51.260 --> 43:52.780
to stay quiet.

43:55.260 --> 43:59.260
You know, because you've been
convinced it's for the best.

44:03.100 --> 44:07.260
But perhaps we let ourselves
stay silent for too long.

44:09.260 --> 44:13.260
Letting someone else...
speak for us.

44:16.260 --> 44:18.940
I don't think that's what God wants.

44:22.260 --> 44:27.260
No, I think he wants
to hear our voices.

44:39.260 --> 44:43.260
# Abide with me

44:43.260 --> 44:49.300
# Fast falls the eventide

44:49.300 --> 44:54.300
# The darkness deepens

44:54.300 --> 45:00.260
# Lord, with me abide

45:00.260 --> 45:05.260
# When other helpers

45:05.260 --> 45:09.260
# Faith and comforts flee

45:10.300 --> 45:14.260
# Help of the helpless

45:14.260 --> 45:19.260
# Oh, abide with me. #

46:03.260 --> 46:05.260
