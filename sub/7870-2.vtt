<i>CHOIR: ♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

00:04.379 --> 00:06.214
The Simpsons? Wha...!

00:10.093 --> 00:12.220
(exclaiming)

00:16.516 --> 00:18.810
(school bell ringing)

00:20.979 --> 00:22.480
(Barney belches)

00:22.564 --> 00:24.190
(whistle blows)

00:24.274 --> 00:26.317
(yells)

00:30.405 --> 00:31.865
(beeping)

00:34.909 --> 00:38.038
(playing the blues)

00:43.668 --> 00:45.045
(tires screeching)

00:46.588 --> 00:47.797
D'oh!

00:47.881 --> 00:49.132
(tires screeching)

00:54.471 --> 00:56.097
Beer!

00:56.181 --> 00:58.349
(assorted cartoon sound effects)

00:59.559 --> 01:02.353
God, I love to watch
that woman get beer.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.782
-(fart)
-(laughing)

01:13.865 --> 01:15.450
You little...!

01:15.533 --> 01:17.368
(blubbering)

01:17.452 --> 01:18.745
D'oh!

01:20.038 --> 01:21.998
(contented blubbering)

01:35.845 --> 01:38.723
They always come up
with such catchy ways

01:38.807 --> 01:40.850
to make us pay
for things we don't need

01:40.934 --> 01:43.186
for kids we didn't want.

01:49.150 --> 01:53.238
Wow-- the gym ropes
are seaweed,

01:53.321 --> 01:56.574
the basketball nets
are fishing nets...

01:57.742 --> 01:59.244
Yarr! Just plastic.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.247
Which is healthier
than what you find in the ocean.

02:02.330 --> 02:05.583
Buy a Springfield Elementary
T-shirt?

02:05.667 --> 02:08.586
I don't want people to know my
kids go to this lousy school.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.673
We also have T-shirts from
other schools.

02:11.756 --> 02:15.552
Ooh! We can wear those
to the nice mall.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.888
(grunting)

02:21.141 --> 02:24.727
And now it's time for lights,
camera, auction! (chuckles)

02:24.811 --> 02:26.271
No cameras.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.398
Ooh, first item up for bid
is always a favorite,

02:28.481 --> 02:29.858
lunch with Principal Skinner.

02:31.276 --> 02:34.112
I'll just leave the food on your
doorstep and ring the bell.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.447
Moving on.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.199
Next up for auction
is this wonderful bench

02:38.283 --> 02:41.119
hand-crafted
by our second-grade class.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.370
Don't buy it.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.039
I bought one last year
and it was crap construction.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.207
Shh.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.376
Do I hear $50?

02:50.211 --> 02:51.546
Paddles down.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.590
It's the only way
to change the system.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.301
(phone ringing)

02:56.384 --> 02:57.886
Hello?

02:57.969 --> 02:59.262
Calling from England?

02:59.345 --> 03:01.097
Certainly I can put you
on speakerphone.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.850
<i>BART (British lady's voice):</i>
<i>I am Edith Knickertwist,</i>

03:03.933 --> 03:05.143
<i>an eccentric widow.</i>

03:05.226 --> 03:08.605
For this masterpiece, I bid

03:08.688 --> 03:10.690
<i>$1,000.</i>

03:10.773 --> 03:12.650
-(all gasping)
-Sold.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.111
To the mysterious and unverified
Mrs. Knickertwist.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.030
Next item:
our school band will play

03:17.113 --> 03:18.948
at a function of your choice.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.367
<i>I bid $4,000.</i>

03:21.451 --> 03:23.453
Well, it looks like
our model solar-system

03:23.536 --> 03:25.038
will finally get an Earth.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.254
And that concludes
tonight's auction,

03:33.338 --> 03:38.343
which has raised a school
record $116,000.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.677
(cheering)

03:39.761 --> 03:41.304
And our windfall is all thanks

03:41.387 --> 03:43.932
to our dear new friend
on the phone--

03:44.015 --> 03:45.934
'Allo, luvs!

03:46.017 --> 03:49.187
Mm. I've got a bad feeling
about this.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.813
I'm Mrs. Knickertwist.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.275
And I've had a proper
hardy-har at your expense.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.777
(laughs)

03:55.860 --> 03:59.447
Why do I believe everything
I hear in a British accent?

03:59.530 --> 04:04.118
He has thrust upon us
the motley of the tomfool.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.703
I wore this all night
for nothing?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.997
(groans)

04:08.081 --> 04:09.082
(angry muttering)

04:11.334 --> 04:14.587
Mr. Simpson, I know you're not
one of our wealthier parents,

04:14.671 --> 04:17.090
but surely you'll honor
your son's enormous debt.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.508
Why, of course.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.970
Even if I don't have
a legal obligation to pay,

04:22.053 --> 04:24.097
it's clearly the right
thing to do.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.141
Here's $1,000,

04:27.225 --> 04:31.104
$2,000, $3,000...

04:31.187 --> 04:33.064
Oh, I need more cash.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.233
Better go to my invisible ATM.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.402
(humming tune)

04:37.485 --> 04:40.071
What? Two dollar charge
for non-network bank?

04:40.154 --> 04:42.198
-Oh!
-(dejected): Oh.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.033
CHALMERS:
Skin-ner!

04:44.117 --> 04:45.535
Yes, sir?

04:45.618 --> 04:48.288
I was very pleased
with your work last night.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.498
-Really?
-Nope. Fooled again.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.000
I'd say you were dumb as a post,

04:52.083 --> 04:54.085
but at least you can put
a sign on a post

04:54.168 --> 04:56.421
that says
"fresh strawberries-- one mile."

04:56.504 --> 04:58.923
You are a nitwit
in an ill-fitting suit.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.883
I'll have you know
I'm lop-shouldered.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.218
I'm sorry, what did you say?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.387
I said, I'm lop-shouldered.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.931
And I have been since
I was hung by my armpits

05:07.015 --> 05:08.558
in a North Vietnamese prison.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.560
I... I didn't know that.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.520
Oh, the list of things
you don't know could fill

05:12.603 --> 05:14.188
a week's worth of morning
announcements,

05:14.272 --> 05:16.399
with enough left over
for a send-home flyer.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.860
There's no need for hyperbole,
Seymour.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.528
If you think it's so easy
to handle Bart Simpson,

05:20.611 --> 05:21.988
why don't you do it yourself?

05:22.071 --> 05:23.906
(cheering)

05:23.990 --> 05:25.616
You tell him, Seymour.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.286
As some guy said
to some dude with a beard,

05:28.369 --> 05:30.246
"Death to tyrants."

05:30.330 --> 05:31.873
You mean Booth
and Lincoln?

05:31.956 --> 05:34.584
I'm not the history teacher.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.127
Anymore.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.881
Fine. I will personally take over
Bart Simpson's education--

05:39.964 --> 05:43.468
and for once, that boy
is going to learn something.

05:43.551 --> 05:46.637
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm expecting an important call

05:46.721 --> 05:49.891
and cell phone coverage
in here is, uh, spotty.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.686
Oh, nicely done, Seymour.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.439
I guess there's some stones
in your leaf bag after all.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.191
While I'm on a roll,
I'm gonna call

05:58.274 --> 05:59.442
that carpet cleaning service

05:59.525 --> 06:02.320
and tell them our hallway
doesn't count as a room.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.657
Hello, is André there?

06:06.741 --> 06:09.243
Oh, yes, I'll hold.

06:11.996 --> 06:15.083
I know I can superintend--
superintend like the wind--

06:15.166 --> 06:17.835
but teach?
It's been years.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.672
And we both know how that went,
don't we, Gary?

06:23.257 --> 06:26.636
So, you are the so-called
Breakfast Club.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.597
Wrong room.
We're the Fight Club.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.058
<i>♪ Don't you ♪</i>

06:32.141 --> 06:35.561
<i>♪ Forget about me ♪</i>

06:35.645 --> 06:37.730
<i>♪ Don't, don't, don't, don't ♪</i>

06:37.814 --> 06:40.108
<i>♪ Don't you... ♪</i>

06:40.191 --> 06:43.319
Thank God they never went on
to do anything since.

06:45.154 --> 06:48.324
So, Simpson, you'll be
studying with me now.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.493
Same garbage,
different Dumpster.

06:50.576 --> 06:54.080
We'll start with
American history.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.332
Now, I'm sure you know
who these gentlemen are.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.210
BART: Dollar bill guy,
five dollar bill guy,

06:59.293 --> 07:02.171
sex guy, Will Ferrell,
black guy.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.506
(sighs)

07:07.176 --> 07:09.887
Bart, what if I told you
there was a president

07:09.971 --> 07:11.848
who was an actual cowboy?

07:11.931 --> 07:14.350
I'd act like I'm interested,
but inside I'd be bored.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.936
That's as good a place
to start as any.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.938
<i>THEODORE ROOSEVELT:</i>
<i>...great fundamental issue</i>

07:19.021 --> 07:21.107
<i>now before our people...</i>

07:22.650 --> 07:25.778
<i>...can be stated briefly.</i>

07:25.862 --> 07:28.948
<i>It is, are the American people</i>
<i>fit to govern themselves,</i>

07:29.031 --> 07:31.200
<i>to rule themselves,</i>
<i>to control themselves.</i>

07:31.284 --> 07:35.621
<i>I believe they are.</i>
<i>My opponents do not.</i>

07:35.705 --> 07:38.666
Hey, this Roosevelt guy
was sort of interesting.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.002
Did you know he was
a colonel in the army?

07:41.085 --> 07:42.837
You don't say.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.048
And one time, during a speech,
he was shot by a saloon-keeper,

07:46.132 --> 07:49.719
but Teddy finished his speech
before heading to the hospital.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.930
Aha! I'm mad at you
for some reason.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.942
(people chanting)
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy...

08:05.026 --> 08:08.654
I've never said this before,
but I'd like to learn more.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.500
Man, Teddy Roosevelt killed
more Spaniards in one day

08:20.583 --> 08:22.710
than most people do
in their whole lives.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.837
You know,
I hate to say this, Bart,

08:24.921 --> 08:27.048
but the library is about to close.

08:27.131 --> 08:30.384
Really? I wanted to learn
more about trust busting.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.136
Take that, Standard Oil.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.305
Tomorrow, son.
Tomorrow.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.182
Well, I've learned
a lot today.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.268
Now, to go home and let TV
slowly rot it all away.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.062
Eh-eh-eh.
Not so fast.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.606
Teddy Roosevelt believed
you could learn from books.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.608
But he also believed
you can learn

08:45.691 --> 08:47.985
just as much
from the out-of-doors.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.738
I thought teachers only went
outdoors to smoke and cry.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.323
Yes.

08:52.406 --> 08:56.410
Son, have you ever seen a horse
your father wasn't betting on?

08:56.494 --> 08:58.579
-No, sir.
-Come with me.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.166
(Chalmers laughing heartily)

09:02.250 --> 09:03.834
(whinnying)

09:03.918 --> 09:06.587
So, Bart, what have
you learned so far?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.589
Well, when horses poop,
they don't stop.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.424
-They just keep walking.
-Yes, yes.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.885
Well, here's another
fun fact for you.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.429
All around you
is a national park

09:15.513 --> 09:18.140
created by Teddy Roosevelt.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.308
Mm!

09:19.392 --> 09:20.893
Wow!

09:20.977 --> 09:23.271
And here I thought
God created all this.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.897
Thanks for
setting me straight.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.691
Well, wait,
I didn't mean that.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.485
You've filled my head
with horse poop and atheism.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.113
And all these years,
I thought I was unteachable.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.698
Let's stop talking now.

09:35.032 --> 09:38.411
"A man who is good enough
to shed his blood for the country

09:38.494 --> 09:41.914
is good enough to be given
a square deal afterwards."

09:41.998 --> 09:44.125
Just quoting
our 26th president, Lis.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.127
You could use a little T.R.
in your life.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.880
Please. I went through
my T.R. phase in first grade.

09:49.964 --> 09:53.467
Now I realize that the greatest
Roosevelt is Franklin.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.510
Balderdash!

09:54.594 --> 09:57.138
Teddy Roosevelt protected
America's wildlife.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.265
Yeah, so he could
shoot it himself.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.933
Franklin Roosevelt
led this country

10:01.017 --> 10:02.977
through the Depression
and World War II.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.605
-Face on a dime!
-Face on a mountain!

10:05.688 --> 10:09.317
I hated the "Roosie-velts"
and all them family dynasties.

10:09.400 --> 10:13.571
The Kennedys, the Bushes,
Jon Voight and Angelina Jolie,

10:13.654 --> 10:16.991
Mayor Daley and his smart-ass son,
<i>The Daily Show.</i>

10:17.074 --> 10:19.076
That's a lot of anger,
Grampa.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.037
Well, I like Stephen Colbert,

10:21.120 --> 10:23.080
but that's because
I don't get the joke.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.250
And on July 1st, 1898,

10:26.334 --> 10:29.045
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt
and his band of Rough Riders

10:29.128 --> 10:32.131
charged up San Juan Hill
and liberated Cuba.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.842
<i>Cuba si!</i>
<i>Castro no!</i>

10:34.925 --> 10:38.387
I love Teddy Roosevelt because
he had asthma as a boy.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.806
I love him because
he said, "Bully."

10:40.890 --> 10:44.060
The dude really knew
how to rock some jodhpurs.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.937
Hey, maybe Chalmers would let
you guys sit in on our lessons.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.898
After me, men.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.900
(chanting)
Bully-bully-bully-bully-bully!

10:52.652 --> 10:54.945
I'd be glad to have you boys

10:55.029 --> 10:57.740
join our experiment
in manly education.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.078
The fact is,
today's modern schools

11:02.161 --> 11:03.913
have completely failed you.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.790
School failed me?

11:05.873 --> 11:08.668
Does school have
to go to summer Jimbo?

11:08.751 --> 11:10.795
(groans, sighs)
Look at him, boys.

11:10.878 --> 11:14.423
He is the canary in the
coal mine of a dying empire.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.677
You're in my coal mine
now, bitches!

11:17.760 --> 11:20.763
Yeah. Boys are falling
behind in every subject,

11:20.846 --> 11:24.809
because our classrooms
are entirely geared towards girls!

11:24.892 --> 11:29.188
It's all about feelings,
and celebrating differences.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.024
But I loved reading
<i>It's Cool to Cry!</i>

11:32.108 --> 11:33.526
Well, it's not cool to cry!

11:33.609 --> 11:35.194
(sobs)

11:35.277 --> 11:37.947
Boys need to explore!
Build things!

11:38.030 --> 11:40.700
Wreck those things!
And then build them again!

11:40.783 --> 11:43.119
Our first lesson begins
this Saturday,

11:43.202 --> 11:46.956
with an overnight trip
to Springfield Forest.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.875
Legend has it that Teddy Roosevelt
visited the forest

11:49.959 --> 11:52.878
and lost a pair
of his trademark spectacles.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.382
This weekend, we set forth
in search of those spectacles!

11:56.465 --> 11:57.883
(all cheer)

11:57.967 --> 11:59.343
This is all well and good,

11:59.427 --> 12:02.805
but I must know:
what are spectacles?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.141
Glasses.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.684
One time,

12:06.767 --> 12:08.561
I found an old
washing machine over there

12:08.644 --> 12:09.979
that still had clothes in it.

12:10.062 --> 12:10.980
ALL:
Wow.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.857
This place is as beautiful

12:12.940 --> 12:15.735
as the side
of a Coors beer can.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.612
The kind my Dad used to leave
in the bathtub.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.240
There are no bad fathers
in the wilderness, boy.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.491
(growls)

12:22.575 --> 12:23.659
(grunts)

12:26.662 --> 12:29.206
(owl hoots)

12:34.503 --> 12:35.671
Hmm?

12:38.340 --> 12:39.592
You know, Bart,

12:39.675 --> 12:42.428
morning is when I miss
my Rosemary the most.

12:42.511 --> 12:45.181
She sure looked good
in a pair of jammies.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.682
(chuckles)

12:48.934 --> 12:51.020
NELSON:
Dinguses! Dinguses!

12:51.103 --> 12:52.855
Huh?

12:52.938 --> 12:53.856
(groans)

12:55.983 --> 12:59.028
I found 'em!
Teddy Roosevelt's spectacles!

12:59.111 --> 13:01.363
Ah, nicely done, Muntz!

13:01.447 --> 13:04.950
Could this be the moment
my life starts to turn around?

13:05.034 --> 13:06.619
The moment I... (gasps)

13:09.038 --> 13:11.624
Gravity blows!

13:14.126 --> 13:16.962
Gary, you took these boys
on an unauthorized field trip,

13:17.046 --> 13:18.464
and look what happened!

13:18.547 --> 13:20.424
He got some bumps
and bruises

13:20.508 --> 13:21.884
and a thistle
in his britches.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.469
What is the big deal?

13:23.552 --> 13:26.055
The big deal is
I'm gonna sue you!

13:26.138 --> 13:28.766
Got me one of them "abogados"
from the bus ads.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.727
He said he'll only take
<i>"veinte por ciento,"</i>

13:31.811 --> 13:33.395
whatever that is.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.315
(Spanish accent) You have seen
my picture on the side of a bus.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.610
And I am not smiling
because I <i>lost</i> the case.

13:39.693 --> 13:40.820
NELSON:
Ha-ha!

13:40.903 --> 13:44.240
I'm gonna take you
for every peso you got.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.575
How did she know
we get paid in pesos?

13:48.619 --> 13:51.747
They took my job away, boys.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.463
Where to, boss?

13:59.547 --> 14:00.840
Just drive.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.466
(tires squeal)

14:02.550 --> 14:04.760
(grunts)

14:05.970 --> 14:08.681
Maybe it is cool to cry.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.350
(sobs softly)

14:18.607 --> 14:20.609
Who can name
the three types of rocks?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.528
Bart Simpson?

14:22.611 --> 14:26.115
Chalmers would actually
take us out to see the rocks.

14:26.198 --> 14:29.118
You can see the rocks on page 32
of your science book.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.953
My book is missing page 32.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.622
Put your head on the desk
and shut your eyes.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.124
My desktop is sticky with soda

14:35.207 --> 14:36.625
from the kid
that had it before me.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.626
Do as I say!

14:37.710 --> 14:40.546
(groans)

14:42.047 --> 14:43.007
(kids clamoring)

14:43.090 --> 14:44.633
(grunting)

14:52.892 --> 14:54.685
-(grunts)
-Stupid fish!

14:54.768 --> 14:56.812
Don't you want to be
my din-ner?!

14:56.896 --> 14:59.398
-Hey, Gary.
-(sighs)

14:59.481 --> 15:02.735
Simpson, you are looking at a man
who was not good enough

15:02.818 --> 15:05.404
for the worst
public school in America.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.740
Well, what would
Teddy Roosevelt do?

15:07.823 --> 15:09.909
Son, I'm no Teddy Roosevelt.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.660
I'm not even
Kermit Roosevelt.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.495
(gasps)

15:16.040 --> 15:19.168
I call this meeting of the Brotherhood
of the Spectacles to order.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.129
Our mission:
to get Chalmers back his job.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.964
ALL:
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

15:24.048 --> 15:28.677
Bart, I want to ask you about
something I read in a magazine.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.430
Are you boys cyberbullying
each other?

15:31.513 --> 15:32.765
How could we be?

15:32.848 --> 15:35.517
We're all in the same place
and we don't have computers.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.479
Marge, I parented!

15:38.562 --> 15:40.105
That's great, Homie!

15:40.189 --> 15:42.274
Come have some
ice cream on a brownie!

15:42.358 --> 15:44.109
Later, losers.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.361
I'm thinking of something big.

15:45.444 --> 15:49.782
So big it involves taking over
the entire school...

15:49.865 --> 15:52.993
and not giving it up till
Chalmers gets his job back!

15:53.077 --> 15:56.205
(sighs) Bart, your mother thinks there's
something suspicious

15:56.288 --> 15:58.582
about all you boys having
a meeting in this tree house.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.085
Well, Dad, since you are
taking an interest in us,

16:01.168 --> 16:02.503
maybe I should tell you...

16:02.586 --> 16:04.880
Oh! Marge,
my ice cream's melting

16:04.964 --> 16:07.216
and I haven't finished
my brownie!

16:07.299 --> 16:09.176
Come in and get
some more!

16:09.259 --> 16:11.178
You guys need to get a woman.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.600
So, I'm considering
taking drugs.

16:16.684 --> 16:20.062
Would the school advise
for or against that?

16:20.145 --> 16:21.563
Oh, strongly against!

16:21.647 --> 16:23.107
Would you like
to read this pamphlet?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.109
Hmm...

16:25.192 --> 16:28.195
Uh, well, would you
read it with me?

16:28.278 --> 16:30.489
(giggles) Oh!

16:30.572 --> 16:34.159
You see, this boy took drugs
and his scores suffered.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.869
(chuckles) Yeah...

16:42.543 --> 16:45.379
(snoring)

16:45.462 --> 16:48.173
There's a car with its lights on

16:48.257 --> 16:50.134
<i>in the teachers' lot.</i>

16:50.217 --> 16:51.176
(gasps)

16:52.511 --> 16:56.181
<i>Late-'90s model,</i>
<i>coffee stains on front seat,</i>

16:56.265 --> 16:58.600
<i>stacks of résumés in backseat.</i>

17:11.196 --> 17:12.531
Bart, what are you doing?

17:12.614 --> 17:15.034
Taking over the school
with all the kids inside.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.202
What?!
I'm telling Mom.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.788
Great. You can call her
from the closet phone.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.081
Hello, Mom?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.292
You won't believe
what Bart's doing.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.127
There really is
a phone in there?

17:26.253 --> 17:28.964
(scoffs)
So immature.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.760
Yo, teachwads!

17:32.843 --> 17:34.511
<i>The Brotherhood</i>
<i>of the Spectacles has</i>

17:34.595 --> 17:35.763
<i>taken over the school!</i>

17:35.846 --> 17:37.389
Oh, no, please.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.183
Don't make us start
our weekend early.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.476
Our paychecks are
in there.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.186
(screams)

17:42.269 --> 17:44.772
Why didn't I sign up
for direct deposit?!

17:47.858 --> 17:49.693
Bart, open this door now,

17:49.777 --> 17:52.112
or I will jiggle the handle
indefinitely!

17:52.196 --> 17:54.073
Suit yourself.
We all rubbed it with boogers.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.574
Damn!

17:55.657 --> 17:57.409
Willie, break it down.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.958
NELSON:
Not so fast!

18:05.042 --> 18:07.461
Back it up
or the photocopier eats it!

18:07.544 --> 18:09.129
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

18:09.213 --> 18:10.964
We've got a 30-year mortgage
on that photocopier!

18:11.048 --> 18:13.050
Willie, stay your tractor!

18:13.133 --> 18:16.553
Ye can't just turn her on
and off like that!

18:17.304 --> 18:18.514
(engine stops)

18:18.597 --> 18:19.807
Oh, I guess you can.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.308
Okay, we gotta
stay focused:

18:21.391 --> 18:23.310
Jimbo, gather all
the students in the gym.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.813
Milhouse, take a nap.
You know how cranky you get.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.064
I do not!

18:27.981 --> 18:29.358
(siren whoops)

18:31.443 --> 18:32.528
(tires screech)

18:35.280 --> 18:37.366
<i>MAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i>Watch </i>Hannity<i> tonight at 8:00.</i>

18:38.450 --> 18:40.869
Dog Day After School?!

18:40.953 --> 18:43.539
This is Kent Brockman outside
Springfield Elementary

18:43.622 --> 18:45.916
with the parents of lockdown
leader Bart Simpson.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.001
He's not a bad boy.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.462
He had a teacher
who finally got through to him,

18:50.546 --> 18:51.839
and they fired him.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.340
HOMER:
Are you covering me up?!

18:53.423 --> 18:54.883
Yes, I'm afraid we are.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.635
The least I can get out of
this whole nightmare

18:56.718 --> 18:58.428
is some face time
on the local news.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.848
It's kind of my way of
sending a Christmas card.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.266
Happy Holidays,
everyone!

19:02.349 --> 19:03.433
Family's fine!

19:03.517 --> 19:05.936
Dude, you better
see this.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.023
Attention, Brotherhood
of the Spectacles:

19:10.107 --> 19:13.110
you are ordered to immediately
evacuate the school,

19:13.193 --> 19:15.612
and then return
to school where you belong.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.282
I need to know that Chalmers
will be taken care of!

19:18.365 --> 19:20.742
We don't negotiate
with terrorists!

19:20.826 --> 19:23.162
Or the people that supply
our uniforms and weapons.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.955
We just pay
whatever they say.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.832
Let me talk to the boy!

19:26.915 --> 19:28.500
(grunts)

19:28.584 --> 19:31.170
It's time for you
to stand down, son.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.255
When I met you,
you were nothing more

19:33.338 --> 19:35.424
than a thick file
of infractions.

19:35.507 --> 19:39.678
Now I see a young man I'm proud
to call my disciplinary problem.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.556
Thanks. But these Rough Riders
aren't dismounting

19:42.639 --> 19:44.016
until you get your job back.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.684
What do you think, Chief?

19:45.767 --> 19:47.686
Can we take the building
without hurting anybody?

19:47.769 --> 19:49.688
Well, if a group of Muppets
can take Manhattan...

19:49.771 --> 19:51.231
-(gun fires)
-Aah! Aah!

19:51.315 --> 19:53.859
-Job restored!
-Increase in title?

19:53.942 --> 19:55.944
Fine, fine.
You're super-duper-intendent.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.071
That's all I ever wanted.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.531
No hard feelings?

19:59.615 --> 20:02.201
Nothing but hard feelings,
Seymour.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.621
(kids cheering)

20:09.166 --> 20:11.376
It's beautiful, man!

20:11.460 --> 20:13.378
It's beautiful!

20:13.462 --> 20:14.463
Oh, my God.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.715
Milhouse, did you take your nap?

20:16.798 --> 20:18.800
Does it look like I took my nap?

20:18.884 --> 20:21.053
(laughs crazily)

20:21.970 --> 20:23.889
BART:
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

20:23.972 --> 20:27.392
Sir, of all the books and movies
about Teddy Roosevelt,

20:27.476 --> 20:29.144
which would you say
is the most informative?

20:29.228 --> 20:32.189
-No question: <i>Night at the Museum.</i>
-One or two?

20:32.272 --> 20:34.024
Take your pick,
you can't go wrong.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.740
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

21:26.618 --> 21:29.955
