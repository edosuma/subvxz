[singing] MTV

00:02.936 --> 00:05.038
Previously on
"RuPaul's Drag Race"...

00:05.138 --> 00:06.606
You need to transform

00:06.706 --> 00:09.576
these educators into glamazons.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.144
Ooh.

00:11.244 --> 00:12.812
Loosey LaDuca.

00:12.912 --> 00:15.115
I felt like you were both
doing something separate.

00:15.215 --> 00:16.349
And you needed to
have that chemistry

00:16.449 --> 00:17.350
to keep you together.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.686
Luxx Noir London.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.955
I see zero
family resemblance.

00:22.055 --> 00:23.423
Anetra.

00:23.523 --> 00:27.027
Your presentation was just
so polished and refined.

00:27.127 --> 00:28.328
Condragulations,
you're the winner

00:28.428 --> 00:29.863
of this week's challenge.

00:31.064 --> 00:34.034
Luxx Noir London,
shantay, you stay.

00:34.134 --> 00:36.870
Loosey, sashay away.

00:40.073 --> 00:45.045
[moody electronic music]

00:48.314 --> 00:49.883
We walk back
into the Werkroom

00:49.983 --> 00:51.818
after I send Loosey home.

00:51.918 --> 00:55.121
And the only thing I'm
thinking is, sorry, Heaven.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.456
You tried.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.158
"Das fucked up.

00:58.258 --> 00:59.426
"Love you hookers.

00:59.526 --> 01:00.927
Don't forget to let Loose."

01:01.027 --> 01:02.929
- Aw.
- Aw, Loose.

01:03.029 --> 01:05.098
She was fierce competition.

01:05.198 --> 01:06.800
But when you play
a dirty game,

01:06.900 --> 01:09.035
sometimes
you get dirty results.

01:09.135 --> 01:11.404
Loosey's strategy
did not really work out

01:11.504 --> 01:14.040
in the way that she thought
it was going to.

01:14.140 --> 01:17.377
Why did you choose to give
Sasha's person to Sasha?

01:17.477 --> 01:21.448
Because she didn't say that
I'm not creative or unique.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.685
Karma is a dish
best served cold.

01:25.785 --> 01:27.454
You thought you got me.

01:27.554 --> 01:29.355
Whose face is the egg on now?

01:29.456 --> 01:31.224
Not mine, yours.

01:31.324 --> 01:33.359
But I respect her
for playing the game.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.961
And I respect her for finally...

01:35.061 --> 01:36.663
I was just about to say.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.765
Admitting to the fact
that she is playing the game.

01:38.865 --> 01:41.668
We give her her props.
She finally was honest.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.003
You can't deny that Loosey
was a fierce competitor.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.707
But regardless,
one bitch closer to the crown.

01:47.807 --> 01:49.609
I think that it's time...

01:49.709 --> 01:50.977
- Let loose, baby.
- To wipe

01:51.077 --> 01:54.013
- and let Loosey loose.
- Let loose.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.015
That was a good one, right?

01:57.250 --> 01:59.385
Being in the bottom two
so close to the end

01:59.486 --> 02:01.287
was a crazy feeling.

02:01.387 --> 02:03.790
There was a slight chance
that I could have gone home.

02:03.890 --> 02:07.527
That completely did not
make sense with my fantasy.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.762
[all giggling]

02:09.863 --> 02:11.297
We're all losing our minds.

02:11.397 --> 02:15.902
I feel it in my heart that
I need to be in the finale.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.103
Congratulations, bitch.
You won.

02:17.203 --> 02:18.371
- Thank you.
- Two in a row.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.340
- You got it.
- So you won three challenges.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.341
[squeals]

02:21.441 --> 02:23.843
Three is too many!

02:23.943 --> 02:26.179
This is insane
winning back to back.

02:26.279 --> 02:28.481
I'm right neck
and neck with Sasha Colby,

02:28.581 --> 02:29.916
which feels right.

02:30.016 --> 02:32.785
All that's left for me
to win is the crown.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.187
[giggles] - [giggles]

02:34.287 --> 02:36.322
Bitch, it's top
four tease for me.

02:36.422 --> 02:37.690
- Top four.
- Top four.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.293
[squealing and screaming]

02:40.393 --> 02:41.728
Bitch.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.764
I've been visualizing this...

02:44.864 --> 02:46.166
moment forever.

02:46.266 --> 02:49.102
I've been nailing everything.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.004
But there is a moment where
I'm thinking, like, ooh,

02:51.104 --> 02:52.438
is the other shoe
gonna drop?

02:52.539 --> 02:55.041
Like, all three of these girls
are tapping on my ass.

02:55.141 --> 02:56.276
[squeals] I can't believe it.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.144
This is wild.

02:58.244 --> 02:59.846
We still have one
more challenge left,

02:59.946 --> 03:02.315
and eye on that prize.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.684
Eye on the grand finale.

03:04.784 --> 03:05.985
I see you.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.154
You're mine,
and I'm coming to get you.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.690
[dramatic music]

03:10.790 --> 03:13.493
Ooh, just all this booty.

03:13.593 --> 03:14.661
Bring out all that ass.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.262
It's like a little pig.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.631
[laughter]

03:18.731 --> 03:20.833

RuPaul's Drag Race...

03:20.934 --> 03:22.068
The winner of
"RuPaul's Drag Race"

03:22.168 --> 03:23.703
receives a one-year supply

03:23.803 --> 03:25.838
of Anastasia
Beverly Hills cosmetics

03:25.939 --> 03:29.876
and a gag-worthy grand prize
of $200,000,

03:29.976 --> 03:31.611
served by Cash App.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.012
[singing] RuPaul's Drag Race

03:33.112 --> 03:34.314
May the best
drag queen win

03:34.414 --> 03:36.516
Best drag queen win

03:38.017 --> 03:41.154
[energetic music]

03:41.254 --> 03:43.056
- Top four, bitches.
- Yes.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.757
All right.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.192
I think that the top four

03:46.292 --> 03:48.394
is exactly how
I envisioned it from the jump.

03:48.494 --> 03:51.798
And for once, I feel like
I can finally just let go.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.800
So I am kind of
letting myself breathe

03:53.900 --> 03:55.068
for once in the competition.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.269
[siren blares]

03:56.369 --> 03:57.971
- Ooh, girl!
- Yes.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.939
She done already
done had herses.

04:00.039 --> 04:01.307
Let's get it, bitch.
Let's go.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.308
Last one.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.010
My top girls...

04:04.110 --> 04:05.278
[squeals]

04:05.378 --> 04:07.547
It's the final lap
in a heated race,

04:07.647 --> 04:12.118
last dance, last chance
to serve some face.

04:12.218 --> 04:13.453
The finale beckons.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.188
There's a crown to mob.

04:15.288 --> 04:17.390
So which bitch is leaving?

04:17.490 --> 04:19.692
And who's on top?

04:19.792 --> 04:21.561
[hip-hop music]

04:21.661 --> 04:23.596
No way.

04:24.697 --> 04:26.266
Hello, hello, hello.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.901
[all screaming]

04:29.002 --> 04:30.737
You're stupid.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.773
[laughter]

04:33.873 --> 04:35.475
My fantastic four,

04:35.575 --> 04:37.710
now, over the course
of this season,

04:37.810 --> 04:40.346
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent

04:40.446 --> 04:42.849
has been pulled, poked,

04:42.949 --> 04:45.285
and prodded like never before.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.587
Well, I don't know
you personally, but...

04:47.687 --> 04:50.657
And now that we are in
the final stretch,

04:50.757 --> 04:55.461
you need to prove that you are
the baddest bitch of them all.

04:55.561 --> 04:56.996
Are you up for the challenge?

04:57.096 --> 04:58.164
What do you think?

04:58.264 --> 05:00.333
[laughter]

05:00.433 --> 05:02.268
For your final
Maxi Challenge,

05:02.368 --> 05:03.936
you'll be collabing with me

05:04.037 --> 05:07.407
on the season 15
remix of my song,

05:07.507 --> 05:08.441
"Blame It on the Edit."

05:08.541 --> 05:09.442
Ooh.

05:09.542 --> 05:10.610
Ooh!

05:10.710 --> 05:12.078
Now, Ru clocking us, honey.

05:12.178 --> 05:13.646
[RuPaul chuckling]

05:13.746 --> 05:15.748
This song is a shady song
because the girls

05:15.848 --> 05:17.317
love to blame it on the edit.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.886
First, you need to write
and record

05:19.986 --> 05:22.188
your own sassy verses.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.023
And then you'll be
working with

05:24.123 --> 05:27.260
"Drag Race" choreographer
Miguel Zarate

05:27.360 --> 05:31.464
to create a space-themed
music video extravaganza.

05:31.564 --> 05:33.499
Ooh!

05:33.599 --> 05:36.336
It's a music video!

05:36.436 --> 05:38.237
Ah!

05:38.338 --> 05:41.341
I get to be in
a RuPaul music video.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.710
Like, this is what I do.
This is what I do.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.511
Meanwhile,
back here on Earth,

05:45.611 --> 05:48.081
each of you
is cordially invited

05:48.181 --> 05:50.583
to join Michelle Visage and me

05:50.683 --> 05:53.219
for an intimate
Tic Tac chitchat.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.088
Love that.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.357
Now, remember,
only three of you

05:57.457 --> 06:00.093
will be going through
to the grand finale.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.495
So whatever happens this week,

06:02.595 --> 06:05.198
don't fuck it up.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.033
- Gag me.
- Oh, my God.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.334
[chatter]

06:08.434 --> 06:11.003
Honestly, I am gagged
because I thought

06:11.104 --> 06:12.739
that we were at the top.

06:12.839 --> 06:14.073
There hasn't been a top three

06:14.173 --> 06:16.008
since season eight
of "Drag Race,"

06:16.109 --> 06:18.211
so the stakes are higher
than Anetra and Sasha

06:18.311 --> 06:19.779
in that comedy challenge.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.615
Racers, start your engines.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.751
And may the best
drag queen win.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.055
All right, divas.

06:29.155 --> 06:30.723
Well, well, well.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.291
I'm gonna take
a listen to the song.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.160
That might be
a smart thing to do.

06:34.260 --> 06:35.828
Y'all haven't heard
the hit song

06:35.928 --> 06:36.863
"Blame It on the Edit" before?
Wow.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.664
[laughter]

06:38.765 --> 06:42.101
We are writing our own verse
to "Blame It on the Edit."

06:42.201 --> 06:45.304
And I am ready to cut up
because everyone knows

06:45.405 --> 06:47.306
this is a shady song.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.275
And who better
than to be featured?

06:49.375 --> 06:51.644
As far as the verse, I feel
like it'll be pretty solid.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.714
Yeah, I feel good at writing.

06:54.814 --> 06:55.815
- Yeah.
- And, like, you know,

06:55.915 --> 06:58.951
I know words.
[laughs]

06:59.051 --> 07:00.586
The inspiration
for my verse...

07:00.686 --> 07:01.788
I really wanted to
write something that

07:01.888 --> 07:04.357
was sexy, dips into the vogue.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.192
Did you see what I did there?

07:06.292 --> 07:08.694
I think it's me.
It's totally me.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.763
But you write music,
like, all the time, right?

07:10.863 --> 07:13.099
Yeah, like, I kind
of, like, do this.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.168
I'm very excited
for this challenge.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.170
I just love writing,
like, bitch track verses.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.838
Yes.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.306
And it's very, like,
a bitch track verse.

07:20.406 --> 07:22.942
This is the last chance
that the judges have

07:23.042 --> 07:25.278
to see what we can do.

07:25.378 --> 07:30.116
And I am just so excited to
finally be a video vixen.

07:30.216 --> 07:32.552
I'm gonna kill
the choreography.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.221
My verse is Denosha Dupree.

07:35.321 --> 07:36.956
It's gonna give today, mama.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.325
My verse is pretty
much, like, written.

07:39.425 --> 07:42.028
So, like, I see
where this is going.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.966
Luxx's strength
is her crazy confidence.

07:47.066 --> 07:49.335
That also could be
Luxx's biggest weakness.

07:49.435 --> 07:51.103
Your drag delusion confidence

07:51.204 --> 07:52.839
has got you to this point, bitch.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.340
But you can never
get too comfortable

07:54.440 --> 07:56.709
because, baby, all it takes
is one slip-up,

07:56.809 --> 07:58.177
and then you are gone.

07:58.277 --> 07:59.812
Luxx, are you asleep?

08:01.280 --> 08:02.682
Luxx is sleeping, child.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.317
Shh, don't wake her up.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.152
[laughter]

08:07.420 --> 08:08.955
- Hi, Sasha.
- Aw.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.323
- Hello, hello.
- Hi, Sasha Colby.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.991
Hi, you both.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.861
It is time to have
the Tic Tac chitchat

08:14.961 --> 08:16.462
with RuPaul
and Michelle Visage,

08:16.562 --> 08:19.298
up close in person,
with a lovely pile of Tic Tacs.

08:19.398 --> 08:20.666
I'm so excited.

08:20.766 --> 08:22.635
Welcome to the
Sasha Colby meet-and-greet.

08:22.735 --> 08:25.004
[chuckles] - Oh, feels good.

08:25.104 --> 08:26.839
When did you come here
from Hawaii?

08:26.939 --> 08:28.140
20 years ago.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.275
- I went to Chicago for a bit.
- Oh, really?

08:29.375 --> 08:30.476
And then I was in Orlando.

08:30.576 --> 08:31.878
And then I finally
made it to LA.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.012
Did you work at The Baton?

08:33.112 --> 08:35.381
- For about six years.
- Six years?

08:35.481 --> 08:36.816
Yeah, five nights a week,
three shows a night.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.818
- That's exhausting.
- Wow!

08:38.918 --> 08:40.786
Yeah, I moved there
to kind of learn

08:40.887 --> 08:42.421
from the best of the best.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.390
- Yes, Mimi Marks.
- Mimi Marks, Monica Munro.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.791
Chilli Pepper.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.760
Chilli Pepper,
the first Continental.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.962
Have you struggled
at all in this competition?

08:50.062 --> 08:51.464
I have, I have.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.867
Internally, there was a
lot of that inner saboteur,

08:54.967 --> 08:57.603
really feeling like I won
two challenges in a row,

08:57.703 --> 08:59.038
two Maxi Challenges.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.439
And the first thing
that came to my mind

09:00.540 --> 09:03.309
was, oh, oh, no, the girls
are gonna hate me.

09:03.409 --> 09:05.111
Like, I feel, like, weird.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.779
Like, I feel like someone
else should get it.

09:06.879 --> 09:10.283
Like, I was willing to let
go of my personal triumphs

09:10.383 --> 09:11.851
to just have, like,
that quick fix

09:11.951 --> 09:13.319
of being liked by everyone.

09:13.419 --> 09:14.554
Why do I need that?

09:14.654 --> 09:16.289
I was really trying
to get down deep,

09:16.389 --> 09:18.791
and it really
came to acceptance

09:18.891 --> 09:22.895
as a child from my family,
and my mom particularly.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.764
Everything I did...

09:24.864 --> 09:26.499
was always just to,
like, have my mom

09:26.599 --> 09:30.436
say she loves me, and, like,
I would never get it.

09:30.536 --> 09:32.638
[sniffles]

09:32.738 --> 09:35.041
And all the pageants I do

09:35.141 --> 09:38.077
and all the, like,
challenges here

09:38.177 --> 09:40.479
has just been for them to
say that they're proud of me.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.583
And I'll never get it
from my mom.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.718
I'll never get it.
[sniffling]

09:45.818 --> 09:47.219
When did that
realization come?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.255
It actually happened...
it was a growing process

09:49.355 --> 09:50.957
from when
my father had passed away

09:51.057 --> 09:52.325
about six years ago.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.393
He had hung himself at 80.

09:55.461 --> 09:56.862
Wow.

09:57.964 --> 09:59.532
He was such a good man.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.434
He was like
my biggest ally, and...

10:01.534 --> 10:03.235
[exhales deeply]

10:03.336 --> 10:04.470
that was the, uh...

10:05.738 --> 10:08.307
Hardest thing I've ever
had to deal with.

10:08.407 --> 10:11.243
We just are left with
so many questions...

10:11.344 --> 10:13.312
[sniffles]

10:13.412 --> 10:15.014
because my father
had actually left me

10:15.114 --> 10:17.083
everything when he passed.

10:17.183 --> 10:20.820
As the queer,
as what we call in Hawaii

10:20.920 --> 10:22.855
the mahu, being entrusted

10:22.955 --> 10:25.758
with this generational land,

10:25.858 --> 10:28.961
it felt like Pop's,
like, seal of approval.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.063
And that's when
I really started to

10:31.163 --> 10:35.101
try and make meaning of life,
and what does it all mean?

10:35.201 --> 10:36.535
What is it all for?

10:36.636 --> 10:40.306
It took, like, going
really, really, really deep

10:40.406 --> 10:41.707
and doing a lot of work.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.310
There is survivor's remorse.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.412
But a part of that equation
has to be

10:46.512 --> 10:49.248
letting go of older tapes
and thoughts.

10:49.348 --> 10:52.051
- Yes.
- There's so much abundance.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.319
There's so much abundance.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.788
And you kind sort of
feel guilty about it.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.356
I mean, look at
Michelle's cheekbones.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.557
I mean...

10:58.658 --> 10:59.792
[laughter]

10:59.892 --> 11:01.160
She got too much.

11:02.128 --> 11:03.562
- She really did.
- Well...

11:03.663 --> 11:05.398
I can't wait for my
abundance of cheekbones.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.466
[laughter]

11:07.566 --> 11:09.835
And the next
chapter has arrived.

11:09.935 --> 11:13.239
And it's like my world
is just so open right now.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.675
With everything that
I've accomplished here,

11:15.775 --> 11:16.676
I feel like I could
do anything.

11:16.776 --> 11:17.710
- You can.
- Anything.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.211
You absolutely can.

11:19.311 --> 11:20.479
We see it.

11:20.579 --> 11:21.681
- Thank you, Sasha.
- Thank you so much.

11:21.781 --> 11:22.615
- Thank you both.
- Thank you so much.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.583
- Good luck.
- Bye!

11:24.684 --> 11:25.851
- Hi, Anetra.
- Hello.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.386
Hi, Anetra.

11:27.486 --> 11:31.023
You're so different from the
Anetra who walks this runway.

11:31.123 --> 11:33.159
- Oh, yeah.
- You're very soft spoken.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.861
- Have you always been that way?
- Yeah, I grew up Mormon.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.563
- Mormon?
- Ooh.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.732
With the way
that I grew up...

11:39.832 --> 11:41.333
I felt that I had to be
that way,

11:41.434 --> 11:43.569
especially with my own
queerness and not feeling...

11:43.669 --> 11:45.137
You had to be quiet.

11:45.237 --> 11:47.440
Yeah, not feeling comfortable
and right to be myself.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.708
Mm.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.609
So I think that,
when I grew up,

11:50.710 --> 11:51.977
that's just the
person that I became.

11:52.078 --> 11:53.245
Yeah.

11:53.345 --> 11:54.747
Anetra, for me,
was like a place

11:54.847 --> 11:57.983
for me to express everything
and do everything and...

11:58.084 --> 11:59.618
- Yeah.
- Go ham.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.053
- Can we please...
- Yes.

12:01.153 --> 12:03.456
Talk about that
fucking lip sync?

12:03.556 --> 12:06.592
Can we talk about
that lip sync?

12:06.692 --> 12:09.328
You flipped over Marcia.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.530
I just remember...
and I had a moment.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.365
I was like, do I do it?

12:13.466 --> 12:15.101
And before, like, I could
even complete the thought,

12:15.201 --> 12:16.936
I was already over top of her.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.539
It was just,
I'm gonna say,

12:20.639 --> 12:22.575
my favorite lip sync
of all time.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.576
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

12:23.676 --> 12:24.577
Are you kidding me?

12:24.677 --> 12:27.446
It was phenomenal.

12:27.546 --> 12:28.881
Thank you.

12:28.981 --> 12:30.483
And you better
walk that fucking...

12:30.583 --> 12:32.084
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's right.

12:32.184 --> 12:33.486
Where did you
learn how to vogue?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.354
Me and my sister Salem,
we used to just be

12:35.454 --> 12:36.889
in the dressing room, like...

12:36.989 --> 12:39.692
we would just put a voguing
track on and start wacking.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.594
- This is in Vegas?
- Yeah.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.196
We don't really have a
ballroom scene in Vegas.

12:44.296 --> 12:46.899
I feel like a lot of, like,
my love for the ballroom scene

12:46.999 --> 12:49.435
is just from, like,
watching videos on YouTube.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.604
But it's just a style of
art that I love so much.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.205
It's much like drag.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.074
Like, it has that
sense of community,

12:55.174 --> 12:58.277
and they obviously
cross paths very often.

12:58.377 --> 12:59.645
You've lip-synched
several times.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.614
You've interpreted the material

13:01.714 --> 13:03.516
in a way that only you can.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.453
And so we're watching this
magic actually happen.

13:07.553 --> 13:08.821
It's just
creative expression,

13:08.921 --> 13:11.090
and it's like the thing
that I love the most.

13:11.190 --> 13:14.093
What would winning
"Drag Race" mean to you?

13:14.193 --> 13:16.495
Winning "Drag Race"
would mean

13:16.595 --> 13:20.566
all of the tribulations
and trials

13:20.666 --> 13:24.870
that I have gone through
would be worth it.

13:24.970 --> 13:29.608
And it would mean
everything, period.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.545
We witnessed you
come out of your shell.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.480
Over the course of
this competition,

13:34.580 --> 13:37.516
it's been a joy to
watch you blossom.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.952
[whispering] Thank you.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.655
- Well, hello, Mistress.
- Hi.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.723
- Mistress, how are you?
- I'm doing well.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.359
You are a queen
who is very outspoken,

13:47.459 --> 13:48.961
not afraid to speak her mind.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.696
Where does that come from?

13:50.796 --> 13:53.566
As a kid, I was never
allowed to be like that.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.267
So when I finally
found my voice

13:55.367 --> 13:57.069
and found where I belonged
in the world, I was like,

13:57.169 --> 13:59.305
it's better to be outspoken
than to be thinking

13:59.405 --> 14:01.006
and replaying it in your
head because, for me,

14:01.106 --> 14:03.142
personally, if I feel
some type of way,

14:03.242 --> 14:04.877
I'm that girl who will
replay it, and replay it,

14:04.977 --> 14:06.879
and replay it until,
like, it explodes.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.414
- Yes.
- So I would rather get it out

14:08.514 --> 14:09.682
in the open right now.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.851
Which is
the healthy way to do it.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.052
It's the healthiest
way to do it.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.486
Absolutely.

14:14.587 --> 14:15.821
But sometimes people
are not ready to hear that.

14:15.921 --> 14:18.023
Has that helped you
or hurt you?

14:18.123 --> 14:19.258
It's gotten me in
trouble here and there.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.160
- In this competition?
- Most definitely.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.494
- With who?
- Especially with girls

14:22.595 --> 14:25.431
like Loosey,
we kinda had a bit of tension

14:25.531 --> 14:26.866
because there was times where

14:26.966 --> 14:28.300
she would act different
off camera

14:28.400 --> 14:30.202
when we were not in the
public eye with people,

14:30.302 --> 14:31.837
and she would say
the same exact things

14:31.937 --> 14:33.572
I was saying
but getting heat for.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.341
So I was seeing
two sides of her,

14:35.441 --> 14:37.109
and I really don't
like that from people.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.777
If you're gonna be a bitch,
just be a bitch.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.880
We call that an
undercover cunt.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.448
[laughter]

14:42.548 --> 14:44.016
Noted.

14:44.116 --> 14:45.851
When you walked
into the Werkroom

14:45.951 --> 14:49.154
the very first episode,
what were you thinking?

14:49.255 --> 14:50.623
What was going
through your mind?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.492
I knew coming in that
I wanted to be competition.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.594
I wanted to just have fun
and, like, not care about

14:55.694 --> 14:57.296
what would happen outside.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.298
This is everything I dreamt
of and everything I've ever

14:59.398 --> 15:00.833
wanted, especially with,
like, everything I've

15:00.933 --> 15:02.134
been through with my family.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.003
They've always
kind of let me down.

15:04.103 --> 15:06.372
I've had times in my life where
I've literally had nothing.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.407
So, like...
[sniffles]

15:08.507 --> 15:10.509
being here, I wanted to make
sure that, like,

15:10.609 --> 15:12.344
I was not only making
my drag family proud,

15:12.444 --> 15:14.580
making my hometown proud,
but making myself proud.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.615
You have your drag family.

15:16.715 --> 15:19.184
And what are they gonna
think about your time here?

15:19.285 --> 15:21.487
[chuckles] My drag mother
is Chevelle Brooks.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.289
She was one of
the first big girls

15:23.389 --> 15:25.357
to win a major national
title for, like,

15:25.457 --> 15:26.358
a skinny girl pageant.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.727
She won Miss USofA 2000.

15:28.827 --> 15:31.196
And she kind of like
really changed drag

15:31.297 --> 15:33.365
and the outlook on
plus-sized drag entertainers.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.034
Coming here,
I had to make sure

15:35.134 --> 15:37.136
that I'm gonna carry on
the legacy.

15:37.236 --> 15:38.604
When I got my message
in "Untucked" from her,

15:38.704 --> 15:40.205
first thing she said was,

15:40.306 --> 15:42.241
"You better not be out
there embarrassing me."

15:42.341 --> 15:44.677
And that was the first thing
she told me--

15:44.777 --> 15:46.545
don't act a fool.
So sorry, mama.

15:46.645 --> 15:47.880
Cut up
a little bit too much.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.349
Yes.
That ship has sailed.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.351
But she's gonna be happy
because I feel like I've came,

15:52.451 --> 15:53.652
and I did everything

15:53.752 --> 15:54.954
- I told her I was going to.
- Oh, yeah.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.890
What Mistress era
are we in right now?

15:57.990 --> 15:59.692
We are in the top three era.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.393
[laughter]

16:01.493 --> 16:03.796
Well, thank you so much
for talking to us.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.264
I would offer you a Tic Tac,

16:05.364 --> 16:08.133
but, you know,
they're about 15 years old.

16:08.233 --> 16:09.802
Don't worry.
I'll steal something else

16:09.902 --> 16:12.671
to make up for it.
[laughter]

16:14.106 --> 16:15.507
Aha, look at this outfit.

16:15.607 --> 16:18.043
Look at this,
doing the Garden State proud.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.913
Oh, my.
You wearing these outfits...

16:21.013 --> 16:23.048
did you have everything
planned out when you came here?

16:23.148 --> 16:24.550
I did.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.485
I wanted every outfit that
I wore on the main stage

16:26.585 --> 16:29.021
and off the main stage
to be a fashion moment.

16:29.121 --> 16:32.191
You know, any opportunity
to be on the grand stage

16:32.291 --> 16:33.759
of the world,
you wanna look your best.

16:33.859 --> 16:36.095
That's absolutely right.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.197
Did you go to
East Orange High School?

16:38.297 --> 16:41.967
No, I went to Cicely
L. Tyson School for...

16:42.067 --> 16:43.936
- Cicely Tyson High School?
- School for Perform--

16:44.036 --> 16:45.904
There's a
Cicely Tyson High School?

16:46.005 --> 16:46.905
School of
the Performing Arts.

16:47.006 --> 16:47.906
School of the
Performing Arts.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.375
- Cicely Tyson?
- Yes.

16:49.475 --> 16:50.609
Fabulous.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.311
I've met her
a couple of times.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.846
I shook her hand.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.582
Cicely Tyson is an
African-American actress

16:56.682 --> 16:59.385
who has a legacy
that is beyond measure.

16:59.485 --> 17:03.322
She really was a pioneer
for so many Black actresses.

17:03.422 --> 17:04.490
She is that girl...

17:04.590 --> 17:06.592
well, she was. Ooh.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.228
You know, as you
speak of being a kid

17:09.328 --> 17:11.330
and being creative like this,
my heart fills with

17:11.430 --> 17:14.133
so much joy and love
because I think, oh,

17:14.233 --> 17:18.303
I would love to have a baby boy
who could do all that stuff.

17:18.404 --> 17:22.408
But then my second thought
is, oh, the world is so mean.

17:22.508 --> 17:25.177
How have you been
able to navigate

17:25.277 --> 17:29.782
some of the not-so-nice
bits of being such a star?

17:29.882 --> 17:33.685
I was kind of raised to
tackle situations head first.

17:33.786 --> 17:38.624
My parents conditioned me to
think very highly of myself.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.492
People ask where I get
my confidence from.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.061
It really is my parents.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.128
They would always tell me
that you have to be

17:43.228 --> 17:45.030
a leader and not a follower.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.633
And you can be
proud of yourself

17:47.733 --> 17:49.001
and your accomplishments.

17:49.101 --> 17:52.404
It is very important
for Black queer people

17:52.504 --> 17:55.407
to be very confident
because there's

17:55.507 --> 17:57.276
always going to be
someone telling us

17:57.376 --> 17:58.477
that we shouldn't be.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.945
I know that there
are going to be people

18:00.045 --> 18:01.447
who have things to say.

18:01.547 --> 18:04.416
But it's my sole mission
to live my life fearlessly

18:04.516 --> 18:06.418
- and freely...
- Right.

18:06.518 --> 18:07.853
Kind of as,
like, a, you know,

18:07.953 --> 18:10.022
slap to the face to everybody
who told me I couldn't.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.024
You're a...[chuckles]
you're a good kid.

18:12.124 --> 18:13.525
You're confident.
You're bright.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.794
You're very smart.
I'm so excited for you, Luxx.

18:15.894 --> 18:17.930
You have such a bright future.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.566
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank you.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.434
It is just the
craziest feeling ever

18:22.534 --> 18:25.270
to be receiving this
sort of validation

18:25.370 --> 18:28.073
from the person
who inspires everything

18:28.173 --> 18:29.608
that you've done
in your career

18:29.708 --> 18:31.844
from the moment
you started to now.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.147
[spacey dance music]

18:35.247 --> 18:36.315
Hey, queens.

18:36.415 --> 18:37.316
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:37.416 --> 18:38.851
It is time to shoot

18:38.951 --> 18:41.086
the "Blame It on the Edit"
music video.

18:41.186 --> 18:43.989
But first, we have to learn
the choreography.

18:44.089 --> 18:47.359
I'm the new Abby Lee Miller.
Dance School for Queens.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.596
I am so excited to
star alongside RuPaul

18:50.696 --> 18:51.964
in the music video.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.832
Wait, did I say star?
I meant co-star.

18:53.932 --> 18:54.833
[ding]

18:54.933 --> 18:56.001
[chuckles]

18:56.101 --> 18:57.302
Today, we are shooting scenes

18:57.402 --> 18:59.838
for your "Blame It on the Edit"
music video.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.340
I'm so excited to be
working with you ladies

19:01.440 --> 19:03.308
again on this final challenge.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.444
You really need to leave
it all on this stage today

19:05.544 --> 19:06.879
and let us have it.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.714
Yes, ma'am.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.082
All right,
let's learn some choreography.

19:10.182 --> 19:12.050
I know we're
all ready to do this.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.652
We have fought our way here.

19:13.752 --> 19:16.655
We have stood our ground.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.824
Give us the choreo, baby.
No mercy.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.960
So, ladies,
I'm looking for some

19:22.060 --> 19:24.163
sci-fi hood girl realness.

19:24.263 --> 19:27.499
And it's clean lines but
with a lot of personality,

19:27.599 --> 19:29.935
but definitely keeping
it in outer space.

19:30.035 --> 19:31.837
Here we go.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.672
You're gonna step out with
your left foot on seven, eight.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.140
You're gonna
brush your shoulders.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.744
Seven, eight, snap, one,
and step to the left.

19:38.844 --> 19:43.448
And then you're
gonna go three, four, five.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.918
I'm kind of nervous
because the choreography

19:46.018 --> 19:47.886
has me very concerned.

19:47.986 --> 19:49.321
And I'm looking around,

19:49.421 --> 19:51.356
and I have three
fierce bitches next to me.

19:51.456 --> 19:53.425
Blame it on the edit.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.626
And...

19:54.726 --> 19:55.827
There's no more
hiding behind someone

19:55.928 --> 19:57.429
and hoping someone's
worse than you.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.065
You have to be the best, or
you're in the bottom, period.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.701
Mistress, make sure that
you step on that left foot

20:02.801 --> 20:04.703
because you're looking a
little lost at the beginning.

20:04.803 --> 20:06.538
So make sure you go
left with the right.

20:06.638 --> 20:07.806
Uh-huh.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.675
Oppose the left foot
with the right hand.

20:09.775 --> 20:12.110
Right hand,
left hand, right hand.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.480
And then go left hand,
right hand, left hand.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.682
Great, Luxx.

20:16.782 --> 20:17.883
From the top. let's go.

20:17.983 --> 20:19.618
Blame it on the edit.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.887
And blame it on the edit.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.155
And shake it to the right.

20:23.255 --> 20:24.856
Step, crack, crack.

20:24.957 --> 20:28.493
Uh-huh, so, Mistress,
just the step, snap, snap.

20:28.594 --> 20:29.661
I'm not making excuses.

20:29.761 --> 20:31.530
This is a very
restricting costume.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.898
Even little hands then...

20:32.998 --> 20:34.633
blame it on the...
keep it little.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.201
Just keep it the attitude.

20:36.301 --> 20:37.936
Don't be shy about
this now, yeah?

20:38.036 --> 20:39.438
- Especially in that outfit.
- Yeah.

20:39.538 --> 20:40.973
All right.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.507
She's saying the costume
is too constricting.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.276
But I think that's just trying
to buy her some time

20:44.376 --> 20:46.645
so she can
learn the choreography.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.181
Five, six,
blame it on the edit.

20:49.281 --> 20:51.083
And blame it on the edit.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.517
And seven.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.586
Shake it to the left.
Shake it to the right.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.955
Down, up, up.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.024
Yes, Sasha.
I like that down.

20:59.124 --> 21:00.759
Down, but then really
bring this arm up.

21:00.859 --> 21:01.893
Yes.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.595
Sasha, A-plus.

21:03.695 --> 21:05.797
That looked great.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.966
So as we're going on,
I'm looking around,

21:08.066 --> 21:09.935
and everyone's kind of
getting the choreography.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.637
Throw it.
Step around.

21:11.737 --> 21:12.904
Grab it in.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.139
I am trying
my best to keep up.

21:14.239 --> 21:16.341
But I can't help but think, like,

21:16.441 --> 21:17.509
I'm already fucking it up.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.510
Shake it to the right.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.979
Step, snap, snap.

21:21.079 --> 21:22.948
Interpretation.

21:23.048 --> 21:25.417
I don't know how
I'm gonna flip this

21:25.517 --> 21:27.319
and make it a success story.

21:27.419 --> 21:30.422
Mistress, it's not bad,
but it lacks confidence.

21:30.522 --> 21:32.090
Yeah, I'm not confident
because I don't know it.

21:32.190 --> 21:33.525
But you know what,
at this point,

21:33.625 --> 21:35.427
you have enough details
to where you need to be

21:35.527 --> 21:36.862
like, fuck it,
start performing.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.765
Speaking of performing,
let's do it.

21:39.865 --> 21:41.933
It's time to shoot the video.

21:43.268 --> 21:45.337
We move real fast

21:45.437 --> 21:47.205
on the set
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

21:47.306 --> 21:49.474
We rehearse, and we film.

21:49.574 --> 21:50.976
That's what we're gonna do.

21:51.076 --> 21:53.612
So let's start with the
first two, Anetra and Luxx.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.714
The fact that we just
learned the choreography,

21:55.814 --> 21:58.183
and not even two minutes later
we have to film the video

21:58.283 --> 22:02.454
is absolutely bonkers
but kind of sickening.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.589
It's the survival
of the fiercest.

22:05.457 --> 22:07.659
Now, ladies, we are shooting,

22:07.759 --> 22:09.528
and we're gonna do
a couple of takes.

22:09.628 --> 22:12.531
That being said, every take
needs to be to be at 1,000

22:12.631 --> 22:15.400
because you never know which
they're gonna use in edit.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.235
- Don't blame it on the edit.
- Okay.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.072
I can pump and vogue
the house down.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.607
But picking up choreography is
a little bit different for me.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.843
I've got it,
but I haven't got it.

22:24.943 --> 22:26.812
So...

22:29.147 --> 22:30.549
All right, here we go.

22:30.649 --> 22:32.918
[singing] Edit,
blame it on the edit

22:33.018 --> 22:35.187
She wanna blame it
on the edit

22:35.287 --> 22:37.222
You the one who said it, edit

22:37.322 --> 22:38.757
- Go on and take the credit
- Ahh--

22:38.857 --> 22:42.060
Anetra, Anetra, Anetra,
Anetra, Anetra, Anetra...

22:42.160 --> 22:44.296
like, you could see
the worry on her face.

22:44.396 --> 22:45.297
Luxx, great.

22:45.397 --> 22:47.032
- Thank you.
- Okay, Anetra.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.834
I don't want you
looking frightened like deer

22:48.934 --> 22:51.036
caught in the headlights.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.771
You watched the--

22:52.871 --> 22:54.706
one of the most
iconic videos, "Scream."

22:54.806 --> 22:56.708
It needs that Janet energy.

22:56.808 --> 22:59.478
Bring Ms. Jackson
to the forefront.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.313
Well, if you're nasty.

23:01.413 --> 23:02.714
I want Janet served hot.

23:02.814 --> 23:03.715
Do it for Janet.

23:03.815 --> 23:05.851
Yes, justice for Janet.

23:05.951 --> 23:08.553
- Our queen.
- Ow.

23:08.653 --> 23:10.389
Here we go.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.391
- What happened, Luxx?
- I lost a nail.

23:12.491 --> 23:14.059
- A nail?
- And it's white,

23:14.159 --> 23:16.027
so it's gonna be
impossible to find.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.562
- Jesus.
- Crunch.

23:17.662 --> 23:20.132
This looks like a
white party-afters.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.900
- [laughter]
- Right?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.735
Make sure it's
not in your outfit.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.904
- Is it?
- Told you.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.406
All right, music's on.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.408
Remember who you girls are.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.443
- That part.
- The one.

23:31.543 --> 23:33.812
[hip-hop music]

23:33.912 --> 23:34.813
Girl.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.114
Let's go.

23:36.214 --> 23:38.083
[singing] Edit, blame it
on the edit

23:38.183 --> 23:40.018
She wanna blame it
on the edit

23:40.118 --> 23:42.120
You the one who said it, bitch

23:42.220 --> 23:43.889
How you gon' regret it?

23:43.989 --> 23:45.257
Blame it on the edit

23:45.357 --> 23:47.692
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

23:47.793 --> 23:49.394
Nasty?

23:49.494 --> 23:50.695
All right,
you two have a seat.

23:50.796 --> 23:52.898
I feel really good
about what I did.

23:52.998 --> 23:55.801
I think I ate
every aspect of it.

23:55.901 --> 23:57.502
I'm so full right now.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.071
I kind of crushed it.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.974
Sasha Colby,
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

24:03.074 --> 24:04.576
Barb Wyre has joined us.

24:04.676 --> 24:06.011
I'm feeling
my fantasy, honey.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.079
Barb Wyre comes again.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.948
This time, it'll be a hit.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.552
All right, music.
Here we go.

24:13.652 --> 24:14.753
[singing] Edit, blame it
on the edit

24:14.853 --> 24:17.622
Get it, Isabelle.
Come on.

24:17.722 --> 24:18.924
[singing] You the one
who said it, bitch

24:19.024 --> 24:20.492
Go on and take
the credit, bitch

24:25.497 --> 24:26.665
[ding]

24:26.765 --> 24:28.600
Sasha is nailing
the choreography.

24:28.700 --> 24:31.069
I'm not surprised.
She's an amazing dancer.

24:31.169 --> 24:33.772
Mistress is having
a bit of a hard time,

24:33.872 --> 24:36.475
and I can kind of just see her
getting in her head about it.

24:36.575 --> 24:37.943
And she needs to get out.

24:38.043 --> 24:40.078
- [breathing heavily]
- You all right, Mistress?

24:40.178 --> 24:41.947
- You in your head?
- No, I'm just a fat bitch.

24:42.047 --> 24:43.148
I'm out of breath.

24:43.248 --> 24:44.649
You just gonna give it
to these bitches?

24:44.749 --> 24:46.651
- Or you gonna fight for it?
- No, that's what I'm saying.

24:46.751 --> 24:47.652
I'm ready to, like...

24:47.752 --> 24:48.987
I'm... yeah, I'ma get it.

24:49.087 --> 24:50.989
Fuck no, I'm not gonna
just give it to them.

24:51.089 --> 24:52.958
Regardless if I know
the choreography or not,

24:53.058 --> 24:55.026
I am about to get up and twirl.

24:55.126 --> 24:57.762
Move over, bitch, because the
big girl's coming through.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.331
[singing] Blame it on the edit

24:59.431 --> 25:00.632
Blame it on the edit

25:00.732 --> 25:03.001
She wanna blame it
on the edit

25:03.101 --> 25:04.970
You the one who said it, edit

25:05.070 --> 25:06.271
Go on and take the credit

25:06.371 --> 25:07.906
Blame it on the edit

25:08.006 --> 25:09.140
Blame it
on the edit

25:10.242 --> 25:12.110
See, she can move them arms.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.812
You can move them arms.

25:13.912 --> 25:15.780
That pass was great.

25:15.881 --> 25:18.116
[together]
Extraterrestrial ferocity.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.052
Okay, ladies, that's a wrap.

25:21.152 --> 25:22.554
Cannot wait to see
the final product.

25:22.654 --> 25:23.822
So proud of you.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.790
Only three of us
are going the finale.

25:25.891 --> 25:27.859
I don't know
who's gonna be there,

25:27.959 --> 25:29.794
but I feel bad for the
person that has to leave.

25:29.895 --> 25:31.363
- Thank y'all so much.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.364
- Thank you.
- Bye, kids.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.398
Bye.

25:33.498 --> 25:34.866
Can't blame it on the edit.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.803
[upbeat dance music]

25:38.904 --> 25:40.839
Last day of school, chickens.

25:40.939 --> 25:44.342
It's the end of an era.

25:44.442 --> 25:45.644
Girls.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.379
It's the end of an era.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.381
It's our last day
in the Werkroom,

25:49.481 --> 25:51.416
and I'm taking a deep
breath and taking

25:51.516 --> 25:52.584
it in for the last time.

25:52.684 --> 25:54.786
It's bittersweet.
It's the end of the era.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.255
We are getting painted
for the last time.

25:57.355 --> 25:58.523
Can you fucking believe it?

25:58.623 --> 26:00.926
No, it's actually
kind of, like, wild.

26:01.026 --> 26:03.762
I mean, we literally
did an entire music video

26:03.862 --> 26:05.630
all in 24 hours, bitch.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.966
I'm very excited
to watch the premiere

26:08.066 --> 26:09.834
of the "Blame It on the Edit"
music video

26:09.935 --> 26:10.969
with the judges.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.837
This is going to the thing

26:12.938 --> 26:15.840
that could make or break one of
us getting a spot in the top.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.609
It was very fun.

26:17.709 --> 26:20.178
It was like living your,
like, ultimate video girl,

26:20.278 --> 26:21.680
like, fantasy.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.181
Yeah, I know I'm slow
with choreo,

26:23.281 --> 26:24.716
and Miguel knows
that at this point.

26:24.816 --> 26:26.618
So, like, it was a lot, girl.

26:26.718 --> 26:28.687
I've worked my ass off
to get to this point.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.422
And if you think
I'm gonna let

26:30.522 --> 26:33.825
some little choreography get me
down, you are sadly mistaken.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.594
So it's time to put
my game face back on

26:35.694 --> 26:36.661
and keep it pushing.

26:36.761 --> 26:37.896
I decided to just let go.

26:37.996 --> 26:39.898
And, you know, we only
get to do this once.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.633
And we're so lucky to be here.

26:41.733 --> 26:43.868
So I'm making the most
of every single moment.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.437
As you should.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.372
And, of course,
my verse ate the girls up.

26:47.472 --> 26:50.241
[scoffs] Okay.

26:50.342 --> 26:53.078
Deep down, Mistress knows.

26:53.178 --> 26:54.546
She ain't crazy.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.615
She knows that
she's in jeopardy.

26:56.715 --> 26:59.184
I know she's feeling nervous.

27:01.019 --> 27:02.687
It was kind of
wild to, like, have

27:02.787 --> 27:04.956
to learn the
choreography and then,

27:05.056 --> 27:06.891
like, literally film
it right afterward.

27:06.992 --> 27:08.893
- Yeah.
- I feel like by the end

27:08.994 --> 27:10.729
I got it down pretty well.

27:10.829 --> 27:12.731
But I'm also a little bit
stressed because the finale

27:12.831 --> 27:14.065
is right around the corner.

27:14.165 --> 27:16.034
They're looking at
every little detail.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.269
And it would really suck
for me to go home now.

27:19.337 --> 27:21.439
Okay, bitches,
so let's cut to the tea.

27:21.539 --> 27:24.042
What was everybody's first
impression of each other?

27:24.142 --> 27:26.011
Luxx was like one of
the first people I met...

27:26.111 --> 27:28.046
gorge, painted boots.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.348
But you're, like,
so fun and, like, quirky.

27:30.448 --> 27:33.184
I love your crazy confidence.

27:33.284 --> 27:35.787
I was very happy that you
looked like your pictures.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.490
And I hate when girls,
like, are catfishes.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.291
- Like, I'm not gonna say...
- Say their name.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.327
Malaysia's
Babydoll's Foxx's name.

27:42.427 --> 27:44.095
[laughter]

27:44.195 --> 27:45.764
I already knew who Sasha was.

27:45.864 --> 27:48.033
So I was like, okay,
let's see if she's

27:48.133 --> 27:50.135
gonna be as
sickening as people

27:50.235 --> 27:51.603
are anticipating her to be.

27:51.703 --> 27:53.505
And then to my surprise,
she was.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.173
Surprise?

27:55.273 --> 27:56.641
I was hoping you wouldn't.

27:56.741 --> 27:57.842
I was hoping you would
be a rotting cunt too.

27:57.942 --> 27:59.978
- Ah.
- But you're a sweetheart.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.713
I wasn't expecting
you to be so nice,

28:01.813 --> 28:05.850
if I'm gonna be honest, because
you have, like, a status.

28:05.950 --> 28:09.721
I was really refreshed
that you were not a bitch.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.224
What I've learned is
check your ego at the door.

28:13.324 --> 28:15.694
Just be a joy to be around.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.696
That's really gotten me
where I am today.

28:17.796 --> 28:21.166
When I moved to LA, I was
already Miss Continental.

28:21.266 --> 28:24.035
But no one in LA
knew who Sasha Colby was.

28:24.135 --> 28:25.904
And I really had to
start from the ground up.

28:26.004 --> 28:27.839
I can't be one of those
girls that are like, oh,

28:27.939 --> 28:29.140
you don't know who I am?

28:29.240 --> 28:31.509
Oh, darling.
Like, darling.

28:31.609 --> 28:34.012
No, like, that's
never gonna work.

28:34.112 --> 28:35.947
I already knew Anetra
was gonna be, like,

28:36.047 --> 28:37.182
the silent killer.

28:37.282 --> 28:38.783
You were very quiet.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.618
But I see that
you are very lively.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.520
You just are soft-spoken.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.322
And we have, like, a similar,
like, sense of humor, too.

28:44.422 --> 28:45.590
Very bad.

28:45.690 --> 28:46.891
I think that out
of the four of us,

28:46.991 --> 28:49.861
Anetra has had the
biggest transformation.

28:49.961 --> 28:53.098
When she first came in,
I didn't see much personality.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.633
But as the competition progressed,

28:55.734 --> 28:58.837
she's definitely shown more
of the person that she is,

28:58.937 --> 29:01.773
and I just love her so much.

29:01.873 --> 29:03.808
And Mistress,
at first I was like,

29:03.908 --> 29:05.910
I just know this bitch
is obnoxious.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.313
- Did you say obnoxious?
- Yeah.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.782
But then I found out
that she is obnoxious.

29:10.882 --> 29:12.751
But she has redeeming
great qualities.

29:12.851 --> 29:14.686
[laughter]

29:14.786 --> 29:16.187
I liked your
personality because you

29:16.287 --> 29:17.422
weren't afraid to talk.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.058
I just love that you
say whatever you feel.

29:20.158 --> 29:22.060
And you, like, don't care.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.697
The second you walked in,
the groups met each other.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.499
As soon as you came
up to me, you were like,

29:27.599 --> 29:29.601
Auntie, the bitches are wack.

29:29.701 --> 29:30.902
I should have been
in y'all's group.

29:31.002 --> 29:32.137
[laughter]

29:32.237 --> 29:34.139
I do remember
hearing you say that.

29:34.239 --> 29:36.107
You are a handful already.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.676
Girl, look around.
Did I lie?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.044
There's no one from
my group, bitch.

29:40.145 --> 29:41.479
[chuckling]

29:41.579 --> 29:43.014
I didn't come in
to make friends.

29:43.114 --> 29:46.317
But to my surprise, I've
made a few along the way,

29:46.417 --> 29:49.053
even though I try to
be in my bitchy era.

29:49.154 --> 29:50.522
[chuckles]

29:51.890 --> 29:54.826
We got to have some
moments here, like some, oh!

29:54.926 --> 29:56.728
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.096
What was y'all's
favorite gate?

29:58.196 --> 29:59.731
Well, that's shady, honey.

29:59.831 --> 30:02.100
If there's one thing this
season will be known for,

30:02.200 --> 30:05.303
it is definitely gonna be
the season of the gates.

30:05.403 --> 30:07.839
Metal-gate, Heaven-gate...

30:07.939 --> 30:09.274
- 40-inch-gate.
- 40-inch-gate.

30:09.374 --> 30:10.275
Baby-bump-gate.

30:10.375 --> 30:11.709
Baby-bump-gate.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.044
Baby bump... oh, my God.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.813
Ooh, why am I
seeing a pattern?

30:14.913 --> 30:16.915
Why is Luxx in
every gate, honey?

30:17.015 --> 30:19.250
Every gate that happened
that I was a part of...

30:19.350 --> 30:20.718
Bitch, all the gates.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.587
Apparently, I was a
part of all of the gates.

30:22.687 --> 30:27.559
I would consider myself the
gatekeeper of season 15.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.661
But I didn't
provoke any of them.

30:29.761 --> 30:31.663
Or if I did provoke it,
I didn't escalate it

30:31.763 --> 30:34.265
for it to become
a full-on gate.

30:34.365 --> 30:36.267
However, I am the
one who said it.

30:36.367 --> 30:38.937
Blame it on the edit.

30:39.037 --> 30:41.105
[upbeat music]

30:41.206 --> 30:43.842
We are all about to go
back on the main stage

30:43.942 --> 30:46.578
for the last time
to find out

30:46.678 --> 30:49.581
who is moving on
to the grand finale.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.182
I love all of these girls.

30:51.282 --> 30:55.653
But I am looking at the end
goal, which is the crown.

30:55.753 --> 30:59.023
Isn't it wild to
think that one of us

30:59.123 --> 31:01.192
is going to be America's
Next Drag Superstar?

31:01.292 --> 31:03.261
I know, I can't wait.

31:04.562 --> 31:05.630
I don't want to be
in the top three.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.031
I need to be in the top three.

31:07.131 --> 31:10.034
I want this more than words
can even describe.

31:10.134 --> 31:11.769
I deserve to be in
the finale because

31:11.870 --> 31:13.037
I'm a phenomenal performer.

31:13.137 --> 31:15.173
I'm a phenomenal drag
queen and... period.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.175
I should be at
the grand finale

31:17.275 --> 31:19.544
because I am a drag queen.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.914
My Stockard Channing moment.

31:23.014 --> 31:25.183
I just want to
come out already.

31:25.283 --> 31:27.018
God, the suspense is...

31:27.118 --> 31:28.219
eee!

31:38.029 --> 31:41.032
[RuPaul's "Cover Girl starts]

31:45.703 --> 31:49.173
[singing] Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk

31:49.274 --> 31:52.877
Head to toe,
let your whole body talk

31:52.977 --> 31:54.212
[applause]

31:54.312 --> 31:56.948
- Take your time.
- Take your time, Mama.

31:57.048 --> 32:00.118
[laughs] Welcome
to the main stage

32:00.218 --> 32:01.819

32:01.920 --> 32:03.855
She's not a bitch.

32:03.955 --> 32:05.723
She's just edited that way.

32:05.823 --> 32:07.725
It's Michelle Visage.

32:07.825 --> 32:10.862
No, Ru, I am
actually that bitch.

32:15.800 --> 32:20.204
Now, as we reach the end
of season 15, any regrets?

32:20.305 --> 32:23.441
I deeply regret the one time
I agreed with Michelle Visage.

32:23.541 --> 32:26.411
[laughs] - It was
wrong. I'm sorry.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.646
This week,
we challenged our queens

32:28.746 --> 32:33.017
to serve intergalactic
glamour in the music video

32:33.117 --> 32:35.086
"Blame It on the Edit."

32:35.186 --> 32:40.024
And tonight on the runway,
category is Drag Excellence.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.093
Racers, start your engines,

32:42.193 --> 32:44.462

drag queen win.

is your runway

32:51.502 --> 32:54.472
The category
is Drag Excellence.

32:54.572 --> 32:56.874
Up first, Anetra.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.711
Oh, she makes a good point.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.245
Actually, she makes
several good points.

33:01.346 --> 33:02.246
[chuckling]

33:02.347 --> 33:05.083
She wore blue velvet.

33:05.183 --> 33:07.218
This look is
Grand High Empress

33:07.318 --> 33:09.053
Anetra, the house down.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.689
It's one of my favorite
things I've ever made.

33:11.789 --> 33:14.926
It's dripping in beauty,
Asian fierceness.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.595
She's glamorous.
She's artistic.

33:17.695 --> 33:21.733
At the end of this competition
I just feel so elevated.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.801
- You've heard of Flash Gordon?
- Yes.

33:23.901 --> 33:24.836
Well, meet Flash Whoredon.

Go, Flash, go.

33:39.784 --> 33:41.853
I want my final moment
on the runway

33:41.953 --> 33:45.823
to be kind of different
from what I've shown.

33:45.923 --> 33:50.028
I can also show you
elegance, poise, glamour

33:50.128 --> 33:52.096
and still have
myself shine through.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.899
My mug is stamped
for the gods.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.735
The earrings are so heavy.

33:57.835 --> 34:01.305
I just have the weight of my
success in this competition

34:01.406 --> 34:03.708
on my earlobes right now.

all the way to London.

34:09.680 --> 34:13.084
Mm, I guess it
do gotta be white.

34:13.184 --> 34:14.118
[ding]

34:14.218 --> 34:15.119
Sasha Colby.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.722
Aloha, gorgeous.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.657
Oh, her head got lei-ed.

34:21.059 --> 34:24.962
I'm giving you
AB Crystallized

34:25.063 --> 34:27.698
Galactic Federation Queen.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.200
I wanted to bring some
of my Hawaiian culture

34:29.300 --> 34:31.269
with my beautiful orchids.

34:31.369 --> 34:36.374
I am rhinestoned from orchid
stem to all my bracelets.

34:37.108 --> 34:38.609
The dress is immaculate.

34:38.709 --> 34:40.078
It is giving you pageant.

34:40.178 --> 34:41.946
It is hitting the floor perfectly,

34:42.046 --> 34:44.682
straight up Sasha Colby
drag excellence.

34:44.782 --> 34:48.286
I'm also so ethereal and
hopefully makes you gasp

34:48.386 --> 34:50.655
and clutch a pearl or two.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.790
Miss Diamond Head.

34:52.890 --> 34:53.925
If you like it,
then you should

34:54.025 --> 34:55.893
put six, seven rings on it.

34:57.228 --> 35:00.131
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

35:00.231 --> 35:02.233
Ru, she can't win.
She's a cheetah.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.237
I am in my glamazon era,

35:06.337 --> 35:09.974
and I am giving
fierce ferociousness.

35:10.074 --> 35:12.009
I wore this gown for
a national pageant.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.212
Wearing this gown was
the first time in drag

35:14.312 --> 35:15.980
that I felt untouchable.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.648
It means a lot to me.

35:17.748 --> 35:19.884
As you go down the gown,
note the details, bitch.

35:19.984 --> 35:22.019
The cheetah print
is not on the fabric.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.021
It is beaded into design.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.691
Every bead is sewn one by one,

35:26.791 --> 35:29.727
and it is hours and
hours and hours of work.

35:29.827 --> 35:31.762
And that is custom couture, honey.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.598
This gown is heavy, bitch.

35:33.698 --> 35:35.133
This is about 60 pounds.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.201
I know that this gown
will go down

35:37.301 --> 35:39.737
in history because,
bitch, I'm wearing it,

35:39.837 --> 35:41.139
and it looks fucking sickening.

35:41.239 --> 35:43.908
She is feline the fantasy.

35:44.008 --> 35:45.209
I hear she's feral.

35:48.946 --> 35:50.648
Welcome, queens.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.550
And attention, Earthlings.

35:52.650 --> 35:56.554
It's time to blast off
with Anetra,

35:56.654 --> 35:59.357
Luxx Noir London, Sasha Colby,

35:59.457 --> 36:02.226
and Mistress Isabelle Brooks

36:02.326 --> 36:04.929
in the intergalactic premiere

36:05.029 --> 36:07.298
of "Blame It on the Edit."

36:18.042 --> 36:21.245
[singing] All these shows
around the world

36:21.345 --> 36:24.982
And everywhere we go

36:25.082 --> 36:28.819
You'll
never meet another bitch

36:28.920 --> 36:30.988
As salty as these hoes

36:31.088 --> 36:33.324
She wanna blame it
on the edit

36:33.424 --> 36:34.892
Blame it on the edit

36:34.992 --> 36:37.195
She wanna blame it
on the edit

36:37.295 --> 36:39.297
You the one who said it, edit

36:39.397 --> 36:41.065
Go on and take
the credit, bitch

36:41.165 --> 36:42.767
You the one who said it, bitch

36:42.867 --> 36:44.602
How you gon' regret it?

36:44.702 --> 36:45.870
Blame it on the edit

36:45.970 --> 36:47.505
Blame it on the edit

36:47.605 --> 36:49.307
[lip-synching]
Stompin' on roaches

36:49.407 --> 36:50.308
And walking these ducks

36:50.408 --> 36:51.375
Walkin' these ducks

36:51.475 --> 36:53.244
Make my way on the runway

36:53.344 --> 36:54.812
Anetra 'bout to pump

36:54.912 --> 36:56.747
I twist, I whip

36:56.847 --> 36:58.382
I dip, hair flip

36:58.482 --> 36:59.784
Smash that eye

36:59.884 --> 37:01.185
Gloss that lip,
a total ten

37:01.285 --> 37:02.453
Your girl's a hit

37:02.553 --> 37:03.821
[lip-synching] Lookin'
just like a dream

37:03.921 --> 37:05.990
Look so fierce
I be causin' a scene

37:06.090 --> 37:07.825
When I step on the runway

37:07.925 --> 37:09.760
You already know
all eyes on me

37:09.860 --> 37:11.229
Ain't these bitches
left no crumbs

37:11.329 --> 37:13.164
Did it in designer pumps

37:13.264 --> 37:14.832
So when they ask
about Luxx

37:14.932 --> 37:16.534
Let 'em know that
she's the one

37:16.634 --> 37:18.669
[singing] Blame it on the
edit, blame it on the edit

37:18.769 --> 37:21.038
She wanna blame it
on the edit

37:21.138 --> 37:22.773
You the one who said it edit

37:22.873 --> 37:24.675
Go on and take
the credit, bitch

37:24.775 --> 37:26.177
You the one who said it, bitch

37:26.277 --> 37:28.312
How you gon' regret it?

37:28.412 --> 37:29.647
Blame it on the edit

37:29.747 --> 37:31.048
Blame it
on the edit

37:31.148 --> 37:32.250
[lip-synching] Bad bitch body

37:32.350 --> 37:34.018
I don't come and play

37:34.118 --> 37:35.753
Best believe when I
stepped on the scene

37:35.853 --> 37:37.955
Shitty hoes just run away

37:38.055 --> 37:39.590
Dream-chaser, style-maker

37:39.690 --> 37:41.459
Game-changer, bank-maker

37:41.559 --> 37:43.094
Crack the code,
now y'all know

37:43.194 --> 37:45.329
Sasha Colby run the show, ah

37:45.429 --> 37:47.098
[lip-synching]
MIB, I'm the MVP

37:47.198 --> 37:48.799
It makes sense why all
these girls envy me

37:48.899 --> 37:50.434
'Cause I'ma clock the tea,
and I don't give a tuck

37:50.534 --> 37:51.802
Excuse me, why you mad?

37:51.902 --> 37:53.070
Like a bitch
from west bum tuck

37:53.170 --> 37:54.071
But guess what,
yes, I said it

37:54.171 --> 37:55.339
And I made it, too

37:55.439 --> 37:56.774
I'm the next in line,
Kingdom Amaru

37:56.874 --> 37:58.376
And if you step outta
line, I'ma gather you

37:58.476 --> 38:00.111
Make room, 'cause a big
girl's coming through

38:00.211 --> 38:02.079
[singing] Blame it on the
edit, blame it on the edit

38:02.179 --> 38:04.615
She wanna blame it
on the edit

38:04.715 --> 38:06.284
You the one who said it edit

38:06.384 --> 38:08.286
Go on and take
the credit, bitch

38:08.386 --> 38:09.954
You the one who said it, bitch

38:10.054 --> 38:11.555
How you gon' regret it?

38:11.656 --> 38:14.492
Blame it on the edit,
blame it on the edit

38:14.592 --> 38:18.129
All these shows
around the world

38:18.229 --> 38:21.132
And everywhere we go

38:21.232 --> 38:24.935
You'll never meet
another bitch

38:25.036 --> 38:28.673
As salty as these hoes

38:28.773 --> 38:31.275
Blame it on the edit,
blame it on the edit

38:31.375 --> 38:33.711
She wanna blame it
on the edit

38:33.811 --> 38:35.313
You the one who said it, edit

38:35.413 --> 38:37.348
Go on and take
the credit, bitch

38:37.448 --> 38:39.116
You the one who said it, bitch

38:39.216 --> 38:40.951
How you gon' regret it?

38:41.052 --> 38:43.954
Blame it on the edit,
blame it on the edit

38:45.256 --> 38:48.059
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

38:49.393 --> 38:50.428
Wow.

38:52.697 --> 38:57.034
My beautiful queens,
tonight we must decide

38:57.134 --> 39:00.204
which three of you
will be moving on

39:00.304 --> 39:04.442
to the grand finale of
"RuPaul's Drag Race" season 15.

39:05.576 --> 39:07.078
And I've just got
to commend you

39:07.178 --> 39:11.282
on all of the hard work and
devotion that you've put in.

39:11.382 --> 39:13.084
I know how hard this is.

39:13.184 --> 39:17.021
You should be very,
very proud of yourselves.

39:18.522 --> 39:22.293
And now, it's time for the
judges' final critiques,

39:22.393 --> 39:25.563
starting with Anetra.

39:25.663 --> 39:28.265
You look unreal tonight.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.934
There's something
about this look that

39:30.034 --> 39:32.069
hearkens back to
days of old, but also

39:32.169 --> 39:33.404
points towards the future.

39:33.504 --> 39:35.973
This is very
Emperor Ming Flash Gordon.

39:36.073 --> 39:37.708
We keep going back
to Flash Gordon.

39:37.808 --> 39:39.276
Yes, go, Flash, go.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.011
[singing] Ah

39:41.112 --> 39:46.117
What a joy it has been watching
you grow in this competition.

39:47.485 --> 39:50.154
Each challenge that came,
you met it head on.

39:50.254 --> 39:54.325
Then you won three of them,
especially in that Rusical.

39:54.425 --> 39:56.160
When you let us in
and you touched us

39:56.260 --> 39:58.696
the way you did with
your performance,

39:58.796 --> 40:01.165
we will never
forget that moment.

40:01.265 --> 40:03.134
Getting to direct you
in the music video,

40:03.234 --> 40:05.970
I could see you getting
in your own head.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.471
Choreography
is different than voguing.

40:07.571 --> 40:11.175
You chose to do a slower rap.
But I liked it.

40:11.275 --> 40:13.277
And you ended it with almost
a ballroom lingo, you know,

40:13.377 --> 40:15.813
with 10s
and talking about that.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.481
But it's like
how the Bible says,

40:17.581 --> 40:20.151
when it comes to duck-walking,
it's a marathon, not a sprint.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.153
- That's right.
- Yes.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.721
That's my favorite
passage, actually.

40:23.821 --> 40:24.889
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

40:24.989 --> 40:26.123
Tell me about
writing the lyrics.

40:26.223 --> 40:28.793
So I wanted to
obviously call back

40:28.893 --> 40:30.060
to Walking that Fucking Duck.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.762
[laughs] - It was...

40:31.862 --> 40:34.465
it was such a big thing
for me in the competition.

40:34.565 --> 40:35.766
I knew this was gonna be
one of the hardest things

40:35.866 --> 40:37.435
that I had ever done.

40:37.535 --> 40:39.970
And it was also one of the
most transformative things

40:40.070 --> 40:41.572
that I have ever done.

40:41.672 --> 40:44.041
What you've done
in this competition

40:44.141 --> 40:47.244
is nothing short of amazing.

40:47.344 --> 40:49.280
I am so proud of you.

40:49.380 --> 40:50.414
Thank you.

40:50.514 --> 40:53.284
Up next, Luxx Noir London.

40:53.384 --> 40:57.288
I am so proud of my
fellow New Jerseyan

40:57.388 --> 40:59.056
right here in the final four.

40:59.156 --> 41:01.492
Tonight, you look
absolutely beautiful.

41:01.592 --> 41:06.597
Your taste level is beyond.

41:07.765 --> 41:09.099
When I think of the
iconic runway moments

41:09.200 --> 41:11.702
that we've seen
in season 15,

41:11.802 --> 41:13.204
you are at the top of
the list.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.439
Each week, I fell more
and more in love with you.

41:15.539 --> 41:17.007
And look at you now.

41:17.107 --> 41:18.843
And then let's talk
about this video.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.077
I liked your lyrics.

41:20.177 --> 41:22.480
But what I loved
is that you sang.

41:22.580 --> 41:24.114
And then you give us rap,
as well.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.416
You're gonna
give me four lines.

41:25.516 --> 41:28.252
Bitch, I'm gonna show
you everything I got.

41:28.352 --> 41:31.155
You probably got the
choreography the quickest.

41:31.255 --> 41:32.823
And you committed to it.

41:32.923 --> 41:35.025
You're so unabashedly you.

41:35.125 --> 41:36.594
You are so gay.

41:38.295 --> 41:40.030
That's coming from me.

41:40.130 --> 41:43.200
[laughter]

41:43.300 --> 41:47.304
You are the embodiment
of what it is to be proud.

41:47.404 --> 41:50.708
There's no shame in that game,
and the lyrics speak to that.

41:50.808 --> 41:53.744
I see you, and I just
think about all the kids

41:53.844 --> 41:57.114
in the world who could be you.

41:57.214 --> 42:02.119
You have a family that supports
you and that has lifted you up

42:03.254 --> 42:06.056
and said, you can do
whatever you want to do.

42:06.156 --> 42:08.392
And that gives me so much hope.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.329
I'm so grateful for them.

42:12.429 --> 42:13.731
And I don't even
think they know

42:13.831 --> 42:16.534
how grateful I am for them.

42:18.168 --> 42:20.004
I just love them so much.

42:20.104 --> 42:21.539
You are very blessed.

42:21.639 --> 42:24.441
Thank you so much for
all your kind words.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.210
It all just means
the world to me.

42:26.310 --> 42:27.211
[sniffles]

42:27.311 --> 42:28.846
Thank you, Luxx.

42:28.946 --> 42:31.415
Up next, Sasha Colby.

42:31.515 --> 42:34.084
You know, you came into this
competition with notoriety.

42:34.184 --> 42:36.353
Some of these kids may
know about your legacy.

42:36.453 --> 42:37.821
Some may not.

42:37.922 --> 42:39.723
Some may be threatened by it.

42:39.823 --> 42:41.191
Some may not.

42:41.292 --> 42:43.294
But it's a big deal
to be the eldest

42:43.394 --> 42:45.129
and have to hold your ground.

42:45.229 --> 42:49.233
And when you come out so
high, that's even harder.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.869
You exceeded expectations.

42:51.969 --> 42:53.771
Let's talk about this runway.

42:53.871 --> 42:56.240
It's spectacular.

42:56.340 --> 42:59.276
Your performance in
the video was so fun.

42:59.376 --> 43:01.779
I love your Pamela Anderson
situation that you gave us.

43:03.213 --> 43:05.249
And we were all like,
damn, I want to have

43:05.349 --> 43:07.384
sex with an alien tonight.

43:08.953 --> 43:10.354
That's your gift.

43:10.454 --> 43:13.257
And the first line of your
lyrics is "bad bitch body."

43:13.357 --> 43:18.362
You are so much more than
a body, 'cause they go away.

43:19.830 --> 43:22.199
But your kindness
and your inner beauty,

43:22.299 --> 43:25.302
that ain't going anywhere.

43:25.402 --> 43:29.039
As we've learned your story,
you are not only a survivor,

43:29.139 --> 43:31.108
but you are a spiritual leader.

43:31.208 --> 43:33.577
I know the hard knocks.

43:33.677 --> 43:37.748
And they've informed you

43:37.848 --> 43:40.651
how to meet life
on life's terms.

43:40.751 --> 43:43.120
[crying] [sniffles]

43:43.220 --> 43:45.990
Well done, mama.

43:46.090 --> 43:48.425
It was an amazing experience.

43:48.525 --> 43:50.394
I cherish every moment here.

43:50.494 --> 43:55.499
This was really my love letter
to drag, the love of my life.

43:56.667 --> 43:59.403
And I'm so glad I could
have shared it here.

43:59.503 --> 44:01.872
Thank you.

44:03.073 --> 44:08.012
All right,
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

44:09.346 --> 44:10.848
This runway tonight,
well, that's how you do it...

44:10.948 --> 44:14.084
sexy in all the right places.

44:14.184 --> 44:16.153
But I love that you
own being a big girl.

44:16.253 --> 44:20.724
I also love that you never
are the butt of the joke.

44:20.824 --> 44:22.192
I've fallen prey to that.

44:22.292 --> 44:24.428
That's powerful.

44:24.528 --> 44:28.399
We got to see a beautiful
trajectory of all the looks

44:28.499 --> 44:31.402
that Mistress does,
all the while

44:31.502 --> 44:32.703
representing Houston drag.

44:32.803 --> 44:34.605
You must have said it 50 times.

44:34.705 --> 44:37.174
[laughter]
But I say that with love.

44:37.274 --> 44:40.044
And you did them so proud
in this competition.

44:40.144 --> 44:42.413
Let's talk about you
in the music video.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.715
Okay, there were a couple
steps off, couple.

44:44.815 --> 44:46.183
I saw them.

44:46.283 --> 44:49.053
But when they came in
close on your face,

44:49.153 --> 44:52.389
nobody sells
a close-up like Mistress.

44:52.489 --> 44:54.892
Just your eyes alone are...

44:54.992 --> 44:57.761
they tell every part of
the story.

44:57.861 --> 44:59.363
And you also do
this thing where

44:59.463 --> 45:02.032
you can be so sexy
and so pop star

45:02.132 --> 45:04.334
and also hilarious
the next second.

45:04.435 --> 45:06.236
You're so good at that.

45:06.336 --> 45:10.140
Not only are you a fabulous
queen, a gorgeous queen,

45:10.240 --> 45:11.575
but you are a smart queen.

45:11.675 --> 45:15.946
The acting, the performance,
the gorgeous costumes,

45:16.046 --> 45:19.083
the snarky attitude,
unapologetic--

45:19.183 --> 45:20.651
it's so refreshing.

45:20.751 --> 45:22.419
You let a bitch know.

45:22.519 --> 45:25.789
But you let a bitch know
in a way that's still fun,

45:25.889 --> 45:28.192
and with a wink and a nudge.

45:28.292 --> 45:30.294
Remember who you are.

45:30.394 --> 45:31.962
You are anointed.

45:35.099 --> 45:39.336
You are anointed.
And you are anointed.

45:39.436 --> 45:42.372
It's no accident
you're standing on this stage.

45:42.473 --> 45:46.710
Remember I said that.
Remember this moment.

45:48.879 --> 45:51.982
Ladies, many of
our younger viewers

45:52.082 --> 45:54.952
are struggling to
find their tribe.

45:55.052 --> 45:58.622
With them in mind,
I want to ask you this,

45:58.722 --> 46:00.190
starting with Anetra.

46:00.290 --> 46:01.792
If you could travel
back in time,

46:01.892 --> 46:05.729
what would you tell
five-year-old Isaiah?

46:05.829 --> 46:07.531
[inhales] Oh, wow.

46:07.631 --> 46:08.899
[chuckles]

46:08.999 --> 46:11.401
I would say...
[sniffles]

46:11.502 --> 46:14.404
it's gonna be
a rough ride at the beginning,

46:14.505 --> 46:17.674
and you're gonna
have a lot of dark days.

46:17.775 --> 46:20.377
[sniffles] But just hold on.

46:20.477 --> 46:23.413
There is gonna
come a day where

46:23.514 --> 46:27.651
you get to release
and fly free

46:27.751 --> 46:29.920
and be your authentic self.

46:30.020 --> 46:32.456
And it's gonna be
so worth the wait.

46:33.657 --> 46:37.127
So keep strutting around
in them go-go boots.

46:39.263 --> 46:41.498
[sniffles] And I love you.

46:42.866 --> 46:46.904
Luxx Noir London,
what would you tell

46:47.004 --> 46:48.639
three-year-old Justin?

46:48.739 --> 46:50.607
You're gonna
wake up one morning,

46:50.707 --> 46:54.478
and you're gonna say,
"I'm gonna be a star."

46:54.578 --> 46:56.446
And it's gonna come true.

46:56.547 --> 46:58.148
[sniffles]

46:58.248 --> 47:01.118
There's gonna be so many
things that are going to try

47:01.218 --> 47:02.619
to knock you off of your path.

47:02.719 --> 47:07.724
And everything, good,
bad, nice, mean, ugly,

47:08.692 --> 47:10.828
is all going to lead you
[sniffles]

47:10.928 --> 47:14.031
to that star shining as
bright as it possibly can.

47:14.131 --> 47:17.734
People are gonna
try to dim that shine.

47:17.835 --> 47:21.605
But you know deep down
who the fuck you are.

47:21.705 --> 47:23.774
And you know what
you're here to do.

47:23.874 --> 47:27.144
This doesn't happen for
everyone who looks like you,

47:27.244 --> 47:29.446
who comes where you come from.

47:29.546 --> 47:32.149
You have a great
life ahead of you.

47:32.249 --> 47:35.919
Don't take a second
for granted, please.

47:36.019 --> 47:38.155
Thank you.

47:38.255 --> 47:41.024
Sasha Colby,
what would you tell

47:41.124 --> 47:44.194
little three-year-old Sasha?

47:44.294 --> 47:46.330
First of all, woman.

47:47.898 --> 47:49.199
Fit it, bitch.

47:49.299 --> 47:50.634
First of all, your
family doesn't know

47:50.734 --> 47:51.735
what they're talking about.

47:51.835 --> 47:53.604
Just keep the pigtails, honey.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.339
[chuckling]

47:55.439 --> 47:58.675
I would like to tell her that...

48:01.612 --> 48:04.815
Oh, my God, like, your
dreams are gonna come true

48:04.915 --> 48:08.919
because you just
relied on yourself

48:09.019 --> 48:12.289
and your natural instinct and
turned to drag as your therapy

48:12.389 --> 48:14.224
and your best friend.

48:14.324 --> 48:16.894
You're gonna find
yourself so quickly

48:16.994 --> 48:20.430
and will be
questioned about it.

48:20.530 --> 48:24.368
And you will hold
it down so fiercely,

48:24.468 --> 48:26.236
no one can tell you anything.

48:27.638 --> 48:30.274
And I love you
so much because I

48:30.374 --> 48:32.276
know you don't hear it a lot.

48:34.544 --> 48:36.179
I love you so much.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.348
And I'm so proud of you.

48:38.448 --> 48:39.783
Thank you.

48:39.883 --> 48:43.353
Mistress Isabelle Brooks,
what would you tell

48:43.453 --> 48:46.323
four-year-old Israel?

48:51.361 --> 48:55.232
[crying]

48:56.967 --> 49:01.138
Life is
gonna be so confusing.

49:01.238 --> 49:02.372
And you're not
gonna understand

49:02.472 --> 49:05.575
why it feels like
you're invisible

49:05.676 --> 49:08.712
or like you don't matter.

49:08.812 --> 49:11.381
But there's
something in you that

49:11.481 --> 49:14.618
always just holds on to
that little glimmer of hope.

49:14.718 --> 49:17.621
And don't ever, ever lose that.

49:17.721 --> 49:19.823
You may never have that
relationship you always

49:19.923 --> 49:22.392
dreamt about with your family.

49:22.492 --> 49:24.861
But you'll find your tribe,
and you'll

49:24.962 --> 49:26.296
find your chosen family.

49:26.396 --> 49:27.297
And you're gonna find
people who

49:27.397 --> 49:29.466
show you that love is real.

49:29.566 --> 49:31.268
And just get ready because

49:31.368 --> 49:34.438
you're gonna accomplish so
much that you never thought

49:34.538 --> 49:36.773
was possible.

49:36.873 --> 49:38.208
Thank you, Mistress.

49:38.308 --> 49:39.443
Thank you.

49:40.777 --> 49:42.579
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

49:42.679 --> 49:47.684
While you enjoy delicious
House of Love canned cocktails

49:48.552 --> 49:50.020
and mocktails in the Werkroom,

49:50.120 --> 49:52.823
the judges and I
will deliberate.

49:54.291 --> 49:57.294
Now, just between us squirrel
friends, what do you think?

49:57.394 --> 49:59.529
Big decisions to make.

49:59.629 --> 50:00.597
Let's start with Anetra.

50:00.697 --> 50:02.099
Wow.

50:02.199 --> 50:05.502
Won the first challenge,
Walking the Fucking Duck,

50:05.602 --> 50:07.904
and kept walking it
through the competition.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.207
The performance
in the Rusical...

50:10.307 --> 50:11.608
we didn't just watch it.

50:11.708 --> 50:13.243
We felt it.

50:13.343 --> 50:14.644
And then she came back
and won with

50:14.745 --> 50:16.613
the Teachers Makeover challenge,

50:16.713 --> 50:19.616
which was right at the end
of this competition.

50:19.716 --> 50:22.719
She has brought this
momentum into the final four.

50:22.819 --> 50:26.256
In the music video, was she
as strong as Luxx and Sasha?

50:26.356 --> 50:27.524
No.

50:27.624 --> 50:30.694
But I loved her
lyrics because she

50:30.794 --> 50:32.229
is branding herself.

50:32.329 --> 50:34.898
She's a smart kid.
She's a sensitive kid.

50:34.998 --> 50:38.435
And I have just fallen
in love with her

50:38.535 --> 50:39.736
throughout this competition.

50:39.836 --> 50:42.506
That is one
fierce drag queen.

50:42.606 --> 50:44.941
Let's talk about
Luxx Noir London.

50:45.042 --> 50:46.710
The first time
I saw her, I was like,

50:46.810 --> 50:49.579
oh, this is like a club
queen who's like, yes,

50:49.679 --> 50:51.048
just living for the moment.

50:51.148 --> 50:53.850
And as each week came,
I was like, okay, I get it.

50:53.950 --> 50:55.852
Some of these looks
were iconic this season.

50:55.952 --> 50:58.321
Talk about her
Everybody Say Glove look,

50:58.422 --> 50:59.823
where she came out in casts.

50:59.923 --> 51:02.926
You know, that is just a
different kind of thinking.

51:03.026 --> 51:05.262
The House of Fashion,
those zebra pants?

51:05.362 --> 51:07.197
I will never forget that.

51:07.297 --> 51:08.632
Then she's shown us
she's got comedy chops

51:08.732 --> 51:10.801
with the
Funny Girls comedy duo.

51:10.901 --> 51:13.970
And in the music video,
I loved

51:14.071 --> 51:15.472
the way she performed it.

51:15.572 --> 51:16.740
She's a natural dancer.

51:16.840 --> 51:18.708
She understands what she
can do with her body.

51:18.809 --> 51:20.977
She's got such an
effervescence about her,

51:21.078 --> 51:22.979
and she brought that
to the music video.

51:23.080 --> 51:26.483
I look at Luxx, and I think,
finally, a respectable woman

51:26.583 --> 51:28.718
comes out of New Jersey.

51:28.819 --> 51:30.353
You better watch it, Mathews.

51:32.355 --> 51:34.691
Let's move on to
Sasha Colby.

51:34.791 --> 51:36.626
Sasha won three times.

51:36.726 --> 51:38.862
She competed intentfully
and purposely

51:38.962 --> 51:41.264
in every single challenge
with something to say.

51:41.364 --> 51:43.900
And when she didn't win,
she still didn't suck.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.902
Much like me,
she never bottomed.

51:48.371 --> 51:50.273
And that is quite a feat.

51:50.373 --> 51:51.842
Some of her looks
were amazing...

51:51.942 --> 51:53.210
Everybody Say Glove

51:53.310 --> 51:55.078
with that custom
couture baseball outfit,

51:55.178 --> 51:58.048
her Puffer, Please, with that
black-and-yellow outfit,

51:58.148 --> 51:59.583
which--unbelievable.

51:59.683 --> 52:04.254
Her makeover look that she
did--she turned it out.

52:04.354 --> 52:06.590
And in the music video,
the fact that she, like,

52:06.690 --> 52:09.626
leaned back, as opposed
to pushing so hard,

52:09.726 --> 52:10.861
it was so powerful.

52:10.961 --> 52:12.929
I was never not
literally compelled.

52:13.029 --> 52:15.665
I felt like she was a vampire
and she was glamouring me.

52:15.765 --> 52:16.933
[laughter]

52:17.033 --> 52:18.568
I could not look away.

52:18.668 --> 52:21.238
Sasha is a consummate professional.

52:21.338 --> 52:23.573
But some of the
professionals that we've

52:23.673 --> 52:25.509
had like that over the years
can get redundant.

52:25.609 --> 52:29.212
- Yeah.
- Sasha never let that happen.

52:29.312 --> 52:32.349
Not only that,
but what a lovely person.

52:32.449 --> 52:35.252
How lovely and poised she is.

52:35.352 --> 52:37.787
Sasha Colby has it all.

52:37.888 --> 52:40.023
All right,
let's talk about Mistress.

52:40.123 --> 52:42.826
This is another one
who put so much though

52:42.926 --> 52:45.228
into every look
that she brought out here.

52:45.328 --> 52:47.464
Even when she was wearing
the RuPaul racer suit

52:47.564 --> 52:49.666
and she put
the big-girl quotes,

52:49.766 --> 52:51.434
everything had intention.

52:51.535 --> 52:55.572
And she was doing things that
were out of her comfort zone.

52:55.672 --> 52:57.807
She won the Daytona
Wind Sitcom challenge,

52:57.908 --> 52:59.276
where she's an actress.

52:59.376 --> 53:00.844
I love seeing people
surprise themselves

53:00.944 --> 53:02.612
in this competition.

53:02.712 --> 53:04.614
Her performance in the
music video, she struggled.

53:04.714 --> 53:05.916
Not gonna lie.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.185
Now, she might not have
been the best dancer.

53:08.285 --> 53:10.353
But she was the best
lip-syncher of the bunch.

53:10.453 --> 53:12.489
She gave us face
the house down.

53:12.589 --> 53:14.925
You know, you find out
if you're a survivor

53:15.025 --> 53:16.660
or you're a crumbler here.

53:16.760 --> 53:18.128
And she's not only a
survivor, she's a winner.

53:18.228 --> 53:19.696
She has worked it out.

53:19.796 --> 53:21.331
She's like a MacGyver.

53:21.431 --> 53:22.365
We got a MacGyver
reference--thanks.

53:22.465 --> 53:23.500
Yes.

53:23.600 --> 53:24.668
More like MacGayver,
but still.

53:24.768 --> 53:28.071
[laughs] Mistress
cracks me up.

53:28.171 --> 53:30.240
- The bitch has shade for days.
- Mm-hmm.

53:30.340 --> 53:31.508
And she's not mean about it.

53:31.608 --> 53:32.442
But she's just meant
to be a drag queen.

53:32.542 --> 53:33.710
I don't know.

53:33.810 --> 53:35.278
I don't know how we're
gonna do this, right?

53:35.378 --> 53:36.446
There are four queens
up there that could

53:36.546 --> 53:37.647
all be in the finish line.

53:37.747 --> 53:39.449
You know, at the
beginning of the season,

53:39.549 --> 53:43.687
I promised myself to have an
elimination every episode.

53:43.787 --> 53:46.389
I've got to admit,
I'm still making up my mind.

53:46.489 --> 53:48.024
[claps]
Silence.

53:48.124 --> 53:49.893
Bring back my girls.

53:49.993 --> 53:51.228
Ooh.

53:51.328 --> 53:52.762
Oh.

53:52.862 --> 53:54.731
Welcome back, queens.

53:54.831 --> 53:57.500
I've made some
difficult decisions.

[suspenseful music]

54:04.307 --> 54:07.177
Sasha Colby.

54:07.277 --> 54:09.145
Condragulations,
you are the winner

54:09.246 --> 54:10.780
of this week's challenge.

54:10.880 --> 54:12.249
Yes.

54:12.349 --> 54:16.052
Oh, my God, I just
won the fourth challenge.

54:16.152 --> 54:17.254
Yes.

54:17.354 --> 54:20.290
You've won a cash
prize of $5,000,

54:20.390 --> 54:23.660
and you are moving forward
to the grand finale.

54:26.062 --> 54:28.498
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

54:28.598 --> 54:30.634
I'm a finalist
in the grand finale

54:30.734 --> 54:32.535
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

54:32.636 --> 54:35.305
I'm given my golden ticket,
and it's not chocolate.

54:35.405 --> 54:37.040
[chuckles]

54:37.140 --> 54:40.010
It feels so good, like a
lovely, accomplished sigh

54:40.110 --> 54:41.011
of relief.

54:41.111 --> 54:42.846
[exhales]

54:42.946 --> 54:45.448
[suspenseful music]

54:48.618 --> 54:51.054
Luxx Noir London.

54:54.391 --> 54:57.861
You are...

54:57.961 --> 54:59.729
safe.

54:59.829 --> 55:03.533
Condragulations, you're moving
forward to the grand finale.

55:03.633 --> 55:06.336
[squeals] Thank you so much.

55:06.436 --> 55:09.606
I told myself that
I was going to be here.

55:09.706 --> 55:12.442
And that's the
ultimate prize for me.

55:12.542 --> 55:15.178
I want the crown.
That's the ultimate prize.

55:15.278 --> 55:18.248
But this is like, it's a
really big prize as well.

55:18.348 --> 55:19.683
[chuckles]

55:22.619 --> 55:26.489
Anetra,
Mistress Isabelle Brooks,

55:26.589 --> 55:27.891
I'm sorry, my dears,

55:27.991 --> 55:30.293
but you are both
up for elimination.

55:32.829 --> 55:35.098
This is my last chance
to lip-sync

55:35.198 --> 55:36.966
my way into the finale.

55:37.067 --> 55:40.370
The poker face is out,
and I'm ready to slay.

55:40.470 --> 55:44.040
Two queens stand before me.

55:44.140 --> 55:47.277
Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me

55:47.377 --> 55:51.348
and save yourself
from elimination.

55:51.448 --> 55:53.383
[suspenseful music]

55:53.483 --> 55:55.518
The time has come...

55:55.618 --> 55:58.621
for you to lip-synch...

55:58.722 --> 56:01.858
for... your... life.

56:04.561 --> 56:06.496
I'm not gonna
let anything stop me

56:06.596 --> 56:08.298
from my journey to the crown.

56:08.398 --> 56:09.966
I want this so bad.

56:10.066 --> 56:11.401
And I'm gonna give
them a performance

56:11.501 --> 56:12.836
they're gonna remember.

56:12.936 --> 56:17.941
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

56:25.682 --> 56:27.384
[lip-synching]
It's complicated

56:27.484 --> 56:29.185
It always is

56:29.285 --> 56:32.822
That's just the way
it goes

56:32.922 --> 56:36.192
Feels like I've waited
so long for this

56:36.292 --> 56:40.397
I wonder if it shows

56:40.497 --> 56:41.398
Head under water

56:41.498 --> 56:43.767
Now, I can breathe

56:43.867 --> 56:46.403
It never felt so good

56:47.804 --> 56:50.573
'Cause I can feel it
coming over me

56:50.673 --> 56:53.076
I wouldn't stop it
if I could

56:53.176 --> 56:54.811
Come on!

56:54.911 --> 56:57.914
[lip-synching] When love
takes over, yeah

56:58.014 --> 57:00.383
You know you can't deny

57:00.483 --> 57:02.685
I am in this 60-pound dress.

57:02.786 --> 57:04.387
But I'm giving them
everything I've got.

57:04.487 --> 57:07.724
I want nothing more than to be
America's Next Drag Superstar.

57:07.824 --> 57:10.960
[lip-synching] Tonight,
tonight, tonight

57:11.060 --> 57:14.531
Tonight, tonight,
tonight, tonight

57:14.631 --> 57:18.868
Tonight, tonight, tonight

57:18.968 --> 57:21.271
And I-I-I-I-I-I-I'll

57:21.371 --> 57:24.073
Be loving you all the time

57:24.174 --> 57:26.609
It's true 'cause

57:26.709 --> 57:28.511
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

57:28.611 --> 57:33.249
Wanna make it right
with you

57:33.349 --> 57:34.451
Whoo!

57:37.520 --> 57:40.890
[lip-synching] When love
takes over

57:40.990 --> 57:44.894
When love takes over

57:44.994 --> 57:47.363
When love takes over

57:47.464 --> 57:49.499
Over

57:49.599 --> 57:53.069
Over, over...

57:53.169 --> 57:54.838
I've never wanted
anything more

57:54.938 --> 57:56.406
than to be in this finale.

57:56.506 --> 57:58.408
I am laying this heart
out for you on the stage.

57:58.508 --> 58:00.043
And I'm giving you everything.

58:00.143 --> 58:02.145
I'm about to walk
this fucking duck

58:02.245 --> 58:03.580
all the way to the finale.

58:03.680 --> 58:07.517
[lip-synching] When love
takes over, yeah

58:07.617 --> 58:10.753
You know you can't deny

58:10.854 --> 58:12.522
When love takes over

58:14.224 --> 58:15.558
[lip-synching] Yeah

58:15.658 --> 58:17.994
'Cause something's here tonight

58:19.529 --> 58:21.531
- Oh!
- Whoo!

58:21.631 --> 58:23.132
[cheering and applause]

58:23.233 --> 58:25.034
Drag, honey, drag.

58:25.134 --> 58:27.437
Oh, wow.

58:28.638 --> 58:31.307
Ladies,
I've made my decision.

58:31.407 --> 58:35.311
[suspenseful music]

58:39.148 --> 58:42.452
For the first time this season,

58:42.552 --> 58:44.587
shantay, you both stay.

58:44.687 --> 58:46.356
[chuckling]

58:46.456 --> 58:48.191
[uplifting music]

58:48.291 --> 58:52.829
We both fucking stay!
Ah!

58:52.929 --> 58:57.233
Condragulations, you are both
moving on to the grand finale.

58:57.333 --> 58:58.401
Oh, my God.

58:58.501 --> 59:00.837
I am so excited.

59:00.937 --> 59:04.340
Right now, I'm in my winning
era, you junkie whores.

59:04.440 --> 59:06.009
[chuckles]

59:06.109 --> 59:09.345
We have ourselves a top four.

59:09.445 --> 59:12.582
Who do you want to be
America's Next Drag Superstar?

59:12.682 --> 59:15.018
Are you #TeamAnetra,

59:35.104 --> 59:38.675
where we are going to crown
ourselves a winner, baby.

59:38.775 --> 59:43.046
Until then, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

59:43.146 --> 59:45.248
how in the hell you

59:45.348 --> 59:46.716
Can I get an amen up in here?

59:46.816 --> 59:48.918
- all: Amen!
- All right.

59:49.018 --> 59:50.286
Now, let the music play.

59:50.386 --> 59:52.589
[singing]
A little bit of love

59:52.689 --> 59:54.991
Goes a long, long way

59:55.091 --> 59:57.860
Lifting you up
