WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:09.343
The night that you left,
I kissed Crockett. I'm sorry.

00:09.427 --> 00:13.055
April? Really? Huh? All this time,
acting like friends.

00:13.139 --> 00:14.890
Hey! Hey!
Come on!

00:15.683 --> 00:17.351
I couldn't let you keep treating patients.

00:17.435 --> 00:18.853
I had to make your addiction known.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.271
What you did was a betrayal.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.355
You're an excellent doctor.

00:21.439 --> 00:23.065
I wasn't about to let you
throw your life away.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.318
You were right. You gave me my life back.

00:30.114 --> 00:31.615
It's beautiful, Ben.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.659
You're beautiful.

00:33.743 --> 00:34.785
MINISTER: I pronounce you husband

00:34.869 --> 00:35.911
and wife.
Whoo!

00:38.873 --> 00:40.332
I'll say it till the day I die,

00:40.416 --> 00:42.585
there's no better pizza
than Chicago deep dish.

00:42.668 --> 00:45.337
It is not even pizza! It's lasagna.

00:45.421 --> 00:46.672
We're gonna have to agree to disagree.

00:46.756 --> 00:50.134
I will not agree to disagree. No.
You are flat wrong.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.470
Flat, the way the pizza should be.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.307
DANIEL: Lasagna, huh?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.933
That's good. Smart lady.

00:58.017 --> 00:59.977
No, Dr. Charles. Not you too.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.773
I didn't know that you
and Dr. Asher were...

01:03.856 --> 01:05.941
Friends.
Yeah. Good, that's good.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.152
And?

01:08.861 --> 01:11.614
And she needs
a strong support system right now.

01:11.697 --> 01:14.658
So, I'm glad that she has you
as a... as a friend.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.579
Look, I get it. Romantic relationships

01:18.662 --> 01:21.123
are discouraged during
the first year of recovery.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.000
Neurochemically, very little difference

01:23.083 --> 01:25.336
between the dopamine rush that we get

01:25.419 --> 01:28.464
from drugs and alcohol,
and the rush that we get from romance.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.968
I'm sure, as with anything,
there are exceptions to the rule.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.471
I have never actually seen that go well.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.181
I mean, at least not in my, you know,

01:37.264 --> 01:38.766
three decades of experience

01:38.849 --> 01:40.559
counseling people in recovery.
MAN: Next.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.314
Yeah.

01:46.315 --> 01:49.401
Hey. So, how are things with Ethan?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.321
Okay, I guess.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.783
I've tried to get him to talk about it
and he hasn't wanted to.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.327
Hmm. Maybe that's his way of processing?

01:58.410 --> 02:00.371
Yeah, maybe.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.166
Will, you're up. Ambo has landed.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.585
You're going to Trauma Two.
All right.

02:06.669 --> 02:07.962
(TONE RINGS)

02:09.755 --> 02:11.382
Evelyn Myers, 49–year–old female

02:11.465 --> 02:13.217
with progressive early–onset Alzheimer's.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.094
Passed out at home.
Did a 12–lead in the ambo.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.470
She's got peaked T waves.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.097
Hey, did she hit her head
when she passed out?

02:18.180 --> 02:21.475
Her daughter, Molly, didn't think so.
No overt signs of head trauma.

02:21.559 --> 02:22.893
I'm pretty sure that she didn't,

02:22.977 --> 02:24.979
but I was in the other room
when it happened.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.397
I shouldn't have left her alone.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.232
Evelyn, I'm Dr. Halstead.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.110
All right. On my count. One, two, three.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.696
Thanks, guys. Yup.

02:37.366 --> 02:40.202
Rhonchi both sides.
Blunted breath sounds at the base.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.705
Two–plus pitting edema.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.082
Yeah.

02:48.419 --> 02:51.005
Yeah, Molly, is your mom
on any medications for kidney disease?

02:51.088 --> 02:54.300
Uh, I'm not sure. She takes
something called Capto...

02:54.967 --> 02:57.136
Captopril?
I think so.

02:57.219 --> 03:00.139
Sorry, I'm not with her every day.
I'm just home for spring break.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.724
Any family history of kidney problems?

03:01.807 --> 03:05.311
Um. Yeah, yeah, my grandma, my mom's mom,

03:05.394 --> 03:06.562
she had something wrong with her kidneys.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.063
My dad will know what it's called.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.190
CBC, CMP, stat...
What's going on?

03:11.817 --> 03:14.570
Molly, I told you to call me
if anything happened with Mom.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.363
Sorry, Dad. I just freaked out.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.865
It's okay.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.117
Hi, I'm Dr. Halstead.
Elliot.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.494
Elliot. Well, we still need labs,

03:22.578 --> 03:25.873
but I, uh, I suspect Evelyn's
in acute renal failure

03:25.956 --> 03:27.917
in which case, she'll need
emergency dialysis...

03:28.000 --> 03:32.963
No. No dialysis. It's against
Evelyn's advance directive.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.924
Don't listen to him. He lies.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.470
Evelyn, honey, you signed
an advance directive.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.722
Advance directive? What is that, Dad?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.641
No, I didn't sign anything. No.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.060
You don't want dialysis, my love.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.271
Yes. I do. I do. Help me.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.036
Hey, take a look.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.498
Did you get Mrs. Myers' lab work back?

04:07.581 --> 04:10.167
She's profoundly uremic and hyperkalemic.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.045
She's not making urine.
If we don't dialyze her, she'll die.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.922
Well, I reviewed her advance directive.

04:15.005 --> 04:19.301
She prepared it shortly after
her Alzheimer's diagnosis.

04:19.385 --> 04:24.515
And I'll tell you, Mrs. Myers outlined
a number of interventions she didn't want,

04:24.598 --> 04:26.058
including dialysis.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.978
And she appointed
her husband to be her proxy

04:29.061 --> 04:31.313
when she could
no longer speak for herself.

04:31.397 --> 04:34.441
But she can speak for herself.
And she has changed her mind.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.403
I mean, people can modify their advance
directives at any time, right?

04:37.486 --> 04:39.655
As long as they still
have decisional capacity.

04:40.280 --> 04:44.118
Well, you do an evaluation.
And then we'll take it from there.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.202
Great.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.164
Sharon?
Yeah.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.166
Your assistant called.
Michael's plane has landed.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.626
Oh, good.

04:52.710 --> 04:56.171
It's silly, I know, but he's 32 years old.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.507
Mmm–hmm. I still get nervous
when he flies.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.967
(LAUGHS)

05:00.050 --> 05:02.678
I guess I just feel a lot better

05:02.761 --> 05:05.639
when I know he's got
two feet back on the ground.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.474
He's your baby boy.
(CHUCKLES)

05:07.558 --> 05:09.893
How long is he in town?
Just 24 hours.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.605
Interviewing for a sales job
at Kender Bio Systems.

05:13.689 --> 05:17.693
Would love to have at least one of my kids
living in the city.

05:17.776 --> 05:18.986
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.946
Need some help over here!
(GROANING)

05:22.197 --> 05:24.825
This is Nick Elms.
Experiencing severe abdominal pain.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.910
Haven't finished uploading his information
into the system.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.706
I can tell you anything you need to know.
I'm his wife. Alice.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.624
Trini, where are we headed?
Four's open.

05:32.708 --> 05:33.917
(NICK GROANS IN PAIN)
Just breathe.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.711
NATALIE: All right, Mr. Elms,
we're gonna take you right in here.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.922
Ready? One, two three.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.050
There you go. All right.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.052
When did the pain start?

05:43.135 --> 05:44.887
Last night. Nick has a condition

05:44.970 --> 05:48.098
called familial adenomatous polyposis.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.224
It causes polyps in his...

05:49.308 --> 05:51.101
Colon and rectum. I'm familiar.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.605
When was he first diagnosed?

05:54.688 --> 05:55.981
Five years ago.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.984
It had already developed
into colorectal cancer.

05:59.068 --> 06:00.903
He had multiple rounds of chemo

06:00.986 --> 06:02.696
but it came back again last year.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.865
Developed congestive heart failure
from the chemo.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.701
Nick, can you tell me when you had
your last bowel movement?

06:07.785 --> 06:09.620
(IN PAIN) Yesterday morning.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.705
No, the day before.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.248
All right. Well, we do need a CT scan,

06:13.332 --> 06:15.250
but I'm worried there's
a colonic obstruction.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.253
Which means a colostomy, right?

06:18.337 --> 06:19.588
Mmm–hmm.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.173
My doc warned me that was coming.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.549
NATALIE: Well, it may be short–term.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.134
In as little as 12 weeks,
they can reverse...

06:24.218 --> 06:26.512
No, that's...
that's long–term for me, Doc.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.306
I got four months left, at the most.

06:30.349 --> 06:33.102
I really gotta spend it
defecating into a bag?

06:33.185 --> 06:34.561
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

06:38.440 --> 06:41.610
Hey, Mags. Can you page
general surgery for a consult?

06:41.693 --> 06:46.657
Patient is Nick Elms.
Late stage colorectal cancer due to FAP.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.117
Suspected colonic obstruction.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.618
Mmm–hmm.
Thank you.

06:49.701 --> 06:50.828
Got it.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.665
Hey, Mags?
Mmm–hmm.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.749
I can do the consult.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.419
You sure? Thought you were clocking out.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.463
Yeah, well, I got nowhere to be
till cocktail hour.

07:01.547 --> 07:03.048
(CHUCKLES) Have at it.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.640
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Come in.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.059
Bert.

07:15.394 --> 07:19.148
What's up?
Sorry to show up unannounced.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.900
I, um, spoke with Michael.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.194
With him in town,

07:24.278 --> 07:27.614
thought it would be a good opportunity
to smooth things over with him.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.659
Our relationship hasn't been the best
since the divorce.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.786
That's between you and Michael.

07:32.870 --> 07:38.208
I just thought if I told him about us...

07:39.376 --> 07:40.544
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.840
Uh, told him what exactly?

07:44.923 --> 07:46.967
Just that we'd been seeing each other.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.431
I should've checked with you first.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.684
Yeah, that would have been nice.

07:56.351 --> 08:01.940
And now we're seeing each other?
"We're seeing each other"?

08:02.024 --> 08:04.484
We go out once a week, Sharon.
What would you call it?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.280
Look, Bert, I don't have time for this.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.325
Okay.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.336
(DOOR CLOSES)

08:22.961 --> 08:24.963
Babe, what are you doing here?

08:27.216 --> 08:28.842
And who's your sidekick?

08:28.926 --> 08:31.053
This is Auggie, one of my students.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.472
Auggie, this is my wife, Ms. Lockwood.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.515
Nonsense. You call me Maggie.

08:35.599 --> 08:38.185
Hi, Maggie.
What's going on, little man?

08:39.978 --> 08:43.857
Auggie has cirrhosis from something
they called chronic autoimmune...

08:43.941 --> 08:45.234
Autoimmune chronic hepatitis?

08:45.317 --> 08:46.485
Yep, that.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.655
And when he showed up
at school this morning, he sounded winded.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.615
He was running a slight fever as well.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.159
All right, little man.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.911
Why don't you come with me, fellas?

08:56.703 --> 08:57.829
We're going right here.

08:58.747 --> 09:03.627
Babe, why don't you help Auggie hop up
and grab a seat?

09:03.710 --> 09:04.711
All right.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.801
Why don't you scoot back, Auggie?
There you go.

09:10.884 --> 09:15.722
And I am gonna grab you
all the fruit snacks you could want.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.808
I don't have any money.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.061
You're a very important person, Auggie.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.772
The fruit snacks are on the house.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.234
Gimme a sec.

09:31.113 --> 09:36.118
Earl, do you mind keeping my friend,
Auggie, company for a sec?

09:37.202 --> 09:38.954
No. Not at all.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.456
Awesome. Auggie, this is Earl.
He works here.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.625
Hey, big man.

09:45.377 --> 09:46.962
All right, buddy, gimme some.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.214
(VOCALIZES)

09:50.590 --> 09:52.217
Did you get ahold of his parents?

09:52.301 --> 09:53.427
Auggie's in foster care.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.804
I haven't been able to reach
his foster mom, Ruth, just yet.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.723
But I'll keep trying.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.975
All right. I'll go get a doctor
and some fruit snacks.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.770
Oh! Babe, did you remember to...
Call the spa at the resort?

10:03.854 --> 10:05.147
(WHIMPERS SOFTLY)

(SQUEALS IN EXCITEMENT)

10:11.862 --> 10:13.947
Joy, you fractured your distal fibula.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.240
It doesn't require surgery,

10:15.324 --> 10:17.576
but you'll need to be in a boot
for six to eight weeks.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.286
God, I feel like I'm cursed.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.579
You know, I started
this diet two months ago,

10:20.662 --> 10:21.997
I can't lose any weight.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.750
That's why I joined the gym.
I thought I had to exercise more.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.878
Babe, what happened?
You passed out on the treadmill?

10:27.961 --> 10:31.506
(CHUCKLES) Dr. Choi, Nurse Sexton,
this is Max, my fiancé.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.259
I was telling them the reason I joined
the gym is...

10:34.343 --> 10:35.552
I was having trouble losing weight.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.097
You look great.
Max, it's not about that, right?

10:40.349 --> 10:41.975
Now, I just wanna get healthier.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.312
Well, Joy, there are certain conditions
that can make weight loss difficult.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.606
But most of them are common and treatable.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.608
While you're here, we can run some tests.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.985
If you don't mind waiting a bit.
Sounds good.

10:52.069 --> 10:54.946
April, let's get a CBC, FSH, TSH,
and a cortisol level to start.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.323
APRIL: Okay.
I'll see you in a bit.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.407
All right. Thanks.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.922
Hey, Ethan, listen, man. I...

11:19.388 --> 11:20.847
How'd it go?

11:20.931 --> 11:24.309
Evelyn definitely does not
have decisional capacity.

11:24.393 --> 11:27.354
I mean, she didn't understand
the treatment being offered

11:27.437 --> 11:30.023
or even that she had an issue
with her kidneys in the first place.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.194
Well, did she seem depressed? Suicidal?

11:34.277 --> 11:35.612
No, I wouldn't say that.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.906
So she still possesses the will to live.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.283
She just can't articulate it clearly.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.536
Well, except that
when she was of sound mind,

11:42.619 --> 11:46.039
she made it very clear in writing
and to her husband that...

11:46.123 --> 11:48.500
Who she seems highly suspicious of,
by the way.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.835
That's not uncommon.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.003
I mean, it's often the primary caregivers

11:52.087 --> 11:55.215
that get the brunt of the paranoia
in situations like this.

11:55.841 --> 11:59.010
Well, I don't know. Maybe it's worth
convening an ethics committee, then?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.096
An ethics committee?

12:01.179 --> 12:02.806
Yeah. Just get some other perspectives.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.099
I really don't think that's necessary.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.725
I gave her a very thorough evaluation,

12:05.809 --> 12:07.894
I'm confident in my assessment.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.689
Yeah, but ultimately, it is subjective.
Your opinion...

12:10.772 --> 12:13.108
That's right. My professional opinion.
Which is based on...

12:13.191 --> 12:15.193
Decades of experience, I know.
That's right.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.112
Decades of experience.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.242
I'll see you.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.042
BEN: Oh.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.087
Why does it look like that?

12:34.171 --> 12:37.716
Ascites. Fluid accumulates
in the peritoneal cavity.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.135
It can happen in patients with cirrhosis.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.303
(AUGGIE GROANS IN PAIN)

12:43.472 --> 12:45.974
Did you tell Ruth that your belly
was hurting this morning?

12:46.641 --> 12:48.852
She goes to work
before the school bus comes.

12:48.935 --> 12:52.147
Auggie, I'm gonna need to do a procedure
called paracentesis.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.149
So, what I'll do
is I'll insert a needle...

12:54.232 --> 12:56.526
A needle into my tummy
to get all the bad stuff out.

13:00.489 --> 13:04.159
It's not so bad, Mr. Campbell.
It just sounds scary.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.995
MARCEL: So, I'll be performing
the abdominal portion

13:07.078 --> 13:08.413
of the surgery robotically,

13:08.497 --> 13:11.082
while Dr. Castaneda works
endoscopically from below.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.876
Dr. Manning, perfect timing.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.753
Good morning, Dr. Marcel.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.714
Robots and endoscopes?
Doesn't sound like a colostomy.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.717
Yeah. Well, Nick and Alice
and I were discussing it,

13:20.800 --> 13:22.594
and we're gonna take a different approach.

13:22.677 --> 13:26.640
Transanal total mesorectal excision.
TaTME.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.101
I'm sorry. Forgive me,
I'm not familiar with it.

13:30.185 --> 13:33.438
I am aware of TME,
which is a major surgery.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.482
Right. Well, this is a new approach

13:35.565 --> 13:37.609
that allows for better visualization

13:37.692 --> 13:40.862
and removal of tumors in the lower rectum.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.198
Well, I'm sure you've explained
the risks to Nick and Alice.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.407
I sure have, yeah.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.619
We're ready to move Mr. Elms upstairs.
MARCEL: Great.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.997
All right. So, I'll see you
in a couple hours.

13:51.081 --> 13:54.292
Thanks, Dr. Marcel.
All right. Alice, I'll see you.

13:57.671 --> 13:58.838
Crockett?
Yeah.

13:58.922 --> 14:02.509
Why would you suggest a radical surgery
for a terminal patient?

14:02.592 --> 14:06.346
Even if it's successful, it is highly
unlikely it's gonna save his life.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.223
But it could buy him more time.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.849
And a better quality of life.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.268
Yeah. If he doesn't die on the table,

14:11.351 --> 14:13.520
which is a real risk
given his heart problems.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.146
And I didn't sugarcoat that risk.

14:15.230 --> 14:18.733
He has seen many surgeons and none of them
have put this option on the table.

14:18.817 --> 14:22.070
Yeah, 'cause most of them are gutless.
Obsessed with their stats.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.322
Okay. You say gutless, I'd say pragmatic.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.407
Oof!

14:26.199 --> 14:28.285
I see us edging towards
a semantics debate.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.828
I know when I'm outta my depth.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.460
Why don't you just stay with me?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.629
No. Company's putting me up
at the Peninsula.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.757
Oh, fancy! They must really want you.
(LAUGHS)

14:42.841 --> 14:44.718
Mmm–hmm.
(LAUGHS)

14:47.095 --> 14:50.056
So I gotta ask about this
nonsense Dad was talking.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.350
It's not for real, right?

14:56.146 --> 14:58.273
Wait. You're not seriously considering
taking Dad back?

14:58.356 --> 14:59.441
Michael...

14:59.524 --> 15:03.194
(SCOFFS) He walked out after 35 years
of marriage.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.696
Ink was barely dry on the divorce papers

15:04.779 --> 15:06.197
when he started seeing someone else...

15:06.281 --> 15:08.033
Your father and I had a drink.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.161
Maybe he read more into it.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.664
So you're not dating or anything?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.376
No.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.504
I figured he was full of it. (LAUGHS)

15:22.839 --> 15:23.840
So, we still on for dinner?

15:24.883 --> 15:27.886
I got us a reservation
at Swift &amp; Sons for 7:00.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.804
No. That's too expensive.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.890
Only the best for my mom.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.226
And the company's paying for it.
Oh!

15:43.068 --> 15:46.488
Hey, are you busy tonight?

15:46.571 --> 15:49.240
This new Thai place
opened up in my neighborhood.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.409
Wanna give it a whirl?

15:52.077 --> 15:54.496
Let's give it a whirl.
7:00–ish?

15:54.579 --> 15:55.580
Works for me.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.798
Dr. Choi! Something's wrong.

Push five of Ativan. Has Joy ever had
a seizure before?

16:12.138 --> 16:13.139
No, never.

16:13.223 --> 16:14.557
Joy?
All right.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.353
Babe? Well, I thought
you said all her labs were normal?

16:18.436 --> 16:20.480
They were.
Meds are in.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.566
Well, so was this, like, an allergic
reaction to something you gave her?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.528
We only gave her ibuprofen,
and she's had that before.

16:38.373 --> 16:41.000
Oh. You Internet–stalking me, Manning?

16:41.084 --> 16:44.379
Don't flatter yourself. I found it
when I was researching the procedure.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.256
Good for you.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.008
You spent your lab year
studying the technique.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.637
You did your fellowship in the surgical
center that helped pioneer it.

16:52.721 --> 16:56.015
Which makes me, what? Highly–qualified
to perform the procedure?

16:56.099 --> 17:00.270
No, it makes you biased and motivated
by professional advancement.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.817
You see what you wanna see. Excuse me.

17:07.444 --> 17:10.029
You are potentially
costing Nick the chance

17:10.113 --> 17:11.865
to see the birth of his child.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.452
What, so you can get a shot at performing
a complex surgery?

17:39.642 --> 17:41.269
He went to get us coffee.

Sats are still dropping.
You have to do something. Help her.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.193
So, Molly, I would need to intubate...
So do that.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.361
I can't. It's against
your mom's advance directive.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.114
Mom, you have to listen to me, okay?

17:53.198 --> 17:54.741

Do I have your permission
to intubate to save your life? Yes or no?

why you don't ignore an advance directive?

19:07.981 --> 19:09.983
Ms. Goodwin, this is a completely
different situation.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.777
I wasn't ignoring the patient's wishes,
I was honoring them.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.362
And her daughter will back me up on that.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.841
An Alzheimer's patient
has a fluctuation in cognition

19:34.924 --> 19:37.927
doesn't mean they've recovered
their decisional capacity.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.639
I mean, when Evelyn was making her wishes
known, she certainly understood that.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.141
The most important thing she understood

19:43.224 --> 19:47.312
is that, eventually, this disease
was gonna take everything from her.

19:48.229 --> 19:51.399
Signing that piece of paper
was her final act of self–determination.

20:03.077 --> 20:05.747

Dr. Manning.

I was just heading up

Oh, good. I'm so glad I caught you.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.003
You know, everything just
moved so quickly this morning.

20:12.086 --> 20:15.381
I wanted to make sure
that you are on board with the surgery.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.549
I'm not.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.301
Well, did you tell Nick how you feel?

20:19.010 --> 20:20.303
I begged him not to do it,

20:20.386 --> 20:22.889
especially after Dr. Marcel
warned us about the risks.

20:23.514 --> 20:24.724
But Nick was adamant.

20:25.433 --> 20:30.146
He said he wanted to help improve
the treatment options for our son.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.565
Even if it meant
he may not live to see him.

20:33.858 --> 20:37.654
Your son. He could inherit the FAP gene.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.489
There's a 50% chance.

(EXHALES)
This pregnancy was a surprise.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.745
When we found out, all Nick could think
about was our baby's future.

20:46.412 --> 20:51.668
And doing everything he could to prevent
our son from facing the same fate.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.432
Trini, will you take over for a minute?
I'll be right back.

21:06.516 --> 21:07.558
A word, outside?

21:12.313 --> 21:14.649
Auggie's primary physician
sent over his medical records.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.068
Turns out he's supposed to
have paracentesis every two weeks,

21:17.151 --> 21:19.195
but he hasn't shown up
to his last couple appointments.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.780
No wonder his ascites got so bad.

21:21.572 --> 21:22.824
Yeah, I'm calling
Child Protective Services.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.242
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.870
Dr. Lanik, can you please wait
until we speak to his caregiver?

21:27.954 --> 21:30.623
Maybe there's a reasonable explanation.

21:30.707 --> 21:31.708
I thought she was MIA.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.126
I'm working on trying to reach her.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.255
(SIGHS) Fine. You have until 4:00.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.841
But if she is not here, in the flesh,
I'm making the call.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.596
MOLLY: Maybe you don't wanna
take care of her anymore.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.266
You know that isn't true. You know I'd do
anything for your mom.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.059
MOLLY: Then you can't let her die.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.352
Molly, honey...
I won't let you. (SOBBING)

22:04.032 --> 22:07.076
Ms. Myers? My name is Sharon Goodwin.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.079
I'm in charge of patient services
here at the hospital.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.457
Yeah, I saw you talking to my dad.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.961
What if I don't want the doctors
to take out my mom's breathing tube?

22:18.337 --> 22:20.256
Would I have to sue my dad?

22:21.215 --> 22:22.216
Well...

22:25.678 --> 22:28.181
Before we get into logistics,

22:29.307 --> 22:31.100
are you sure you want to do that?

22:32.435 --> 22:34.812
Do you really believe
your father isn't acting

22:34.896 --> 22:36.939
in your mother's best interest?

22:39.150 --> 22:40.943
I mean, he loves her. I just...

22:43.196 --> 22:44.530
I don't wanna lose her.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.742
(SOBS) I don't know what to do.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.538
My mom kept me in the dark
about all of this.

22:55.500 --> 23:00.922
You know, when parents don't share things
with their children,

23:02.215 --> 23:05.676
it's usually out of a desire
to protect them.

23:06.719 --> 23:12.350
I suspect your mother knew how painful
it would be for you to know her wishes.

23:12.433 --> 23:19.232
And she didn't want to place the burden
of carrying them out on your shoulders.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.236
She put a lot on my dad's shoulders.

23:23.319 --> 23:27.281
Yes. Because she knew he could handle it.

23:27.365 --> 23:30.743
But, you're right, it is a lot.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.454
And he's going to need you.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.332
You're going to need each other.

23:38.668 --> 23:39.669
Hmm?
Mmm.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.847
SURGEON: Dr. Marcel,
you should be seeing me.

23:50.930 --> 23:56.352
MARCEL: Yes, seeing your sponge now.
Nice to finally meet up.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.397
Okay. Let's bring the pressure down to 12.

24:00.314 --> 24:01.691
SURGEON: Ready to take the rectum out?

24:01.774 --> 24:04.652
MARCEL: You bet. Here we go, Nick.

24:11.576 --> 24:14.370
Joy, your seizure was caused
by high levels of ammonia in your blood.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.247
Well, how'd she get ammonia in her blood?

24:16.914 --> 24:19.876
Testing revealed
Joy has a urea cycle disorder.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.420
It's a genetic condition
that causes a deficiency

24:22.503 --> 24:26.424
in one of the six enzymes responsible
for removing ammonia from the bloodstream.

24:26.507 --> 24:30.553
But if it's genetic, why was I never
diagnosed as a child?

24:30.636 --> 24:32.346
With milder forms of the disorder,

24:32.430 --> 24:35.474
it's often undiagnosed
until a trigger unmasks it.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.894
Such as childbirth...
Another possible trigger

24:37.977 --> 24:40.563
can be a dramatic
increase in protein intake.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.481
Could you be taking in more protein
with your new diet?

24:42.565 --> 24:45.985
Not really. I actually cut out
red meat and most dairy.

24:46.068 --> 24:48.237
And what about protein bars or shakes?

24:48.321 --> 24:50.448
No, I drink green smoothies.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.658
Triggers aside, how do you treat it?

24:54.076 --> 24:56.871
Well, you're gonna have to be on an enzyme
supplement for the rest of your life,

24:56.954 --> 24:59.040
and maintain a very low–protein diet.

24:59.123 --> 25:02.335
We can manage that. Right, babe?
Yeah.

25:03.377 --> 25:04.712
ETHAN: Joy, just so you understand,

25:04.795 --> 25:08.299
if you don't regulate your protein intake,
there can be serious consequences.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.510
Understood.
Not even a few high–protein meals.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.095
I said I understand, Dr. Choi.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.848
What, do you think because I'm fat,
I have no self–control?

25:16.474 --> 25:20.019
No. Not at all. I'm just suggesting
if protein is the trigger...

25:20.102 --> 25:22.772
Yeah. And I just told you that it wasn't.

25:23.356 --> 25:25.191
Dr. Choi, may I speak
with you outside, please?

25:26.943 --> 25:28.194
Excuse us.

25:31.948 --> 25:34.200
What?
You're so suspicious of Joy.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.452
I can't help but wonder
if you're projecting.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.120
I'm not projecting anything.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.498
The only trigger
that makes sense is protein.

25:40.581 --> 25:43.960
So she's either lying about
what she's eating or she's in denial.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.055
I am so sorry I missed your calls.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.683
My manager doesn't allow us
to check our messages while we're working.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.226
This should never have happened.

26:01.102 --> 26:04.522
We know that Auggie has missed
his last two doctor's appointments.

26:04.605 --> 26:05.982
And I am really sorry about that.

26:06.565 --> 26:11.654
I do my best to get him there,
but the clinic's 40 miles from my house.

26:11.737 --> 26:15.157
I don't have a car,
and I can't always get off of work.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.826
BEN: Is there someone else
that could help out?

26:16.909 --> 26:18.869
Maybe a babysitter that could take him?

26:19.996 --> 26:21.455
Who's gonna pay for that?

26:21.539 --> 26:24.458
Ms. Johnson, we're supposed
to report this as neglect.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.796
But if we do that, they might
remove Auggie from your home.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.631
Maybe you should.
What?

26:31.924 --> 26:33.092
Maybe you should report it.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.222
I love that little boy.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.725
I love him.

26:41.934 --> 26:46.772
(SOBBING) But it's too much.
It's too much.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.234
And I can't.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.246
Alice?

27:06.334 --> 27:09.253
He did well, Alice. Real well.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.589
You can visit him
in the recovery room shortly.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.508
Thank God! (LAUGHS AND SOBS)

27:31.025 --> 27:32.234
So what happens now?

27:32.318 --> 27:37.490
Evelyn's family is gonna take her home
to receive hospice care until she dies.

27:40.785 --> 27:43.954
I wasn't trying to prove you wrong today.

27:44.038 --> 27:45.331
If that's what you're thinking.

27:46.582 --> 27:51.128
Will, I've never thought
of you as a spiteful person.

27:52.546 --> 27:55.758
But we all have a tendency
to put blinders on

27:55.841 --> 28:00.346
when we're confronted with things that we
don't want to hear.

28:09.397 --> 28:11.107
Okay. What I wanna do is prolong this...

28:14.944 --> 28:15.945
BEN: That's why Ruth thought

28:16.028 --> 28:18.697
it would be better for you
to go live with another family.

28:20.491 --> 28:24.495
Since she can't always
take you to the doctor when you need it.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.914
She doesn't want you
to get sick again, Auggie.

28:28.332 --> 28:30.793
I know it's scary
going to live somewhere new.

28:31.669 --> 28:32.753
I'm not scared.

28:34.839 --> 28:37.007
I know why she doesn't want me.

28:37.091 --> 28:40.719
Oh, sweetie, it's not that
she doesn't want you.

28:40.803 --> 28:42.721
She just...
No one wants a sick kid.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.276
ETHAN: Max, I know
Joy wants to be discharged.

28:55.359 --> 28:59.155
But this meal plan she's on,
is she adhering to it?

28:59.780 --> 29:00.781
Yeah.

29:00.865 --> 29:04.160
Because her test results
and what she's saying, they don't add up.

29:06.620 --> 29:09.331
Max?
Okay. Um...

29:10.916 --> 29:12.710
I have an idea of what's going on.

29:13.544 --> 29:16.672
Sometimes, I wake up
in the middle of the night,

29:16.755 --> 29:19.467
and I hear Joy downstairs in the kitchen.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.971
And in the morning, there's food missing
from the fridge and the pantry.

29:24.847 --> 29:26.390
Have you ever talked to her about it?

29:26.474 --> 29:28.934
No. I'm guessing she's real self–conscious

29:29.018 --> 29:30.603
and that's why
she does it after I'm asleep.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.814
Yeah. It sounds like she may have
a binge eating disorder.

29:34.857 --> 29:37.151
I'd like to bring in psychiatry
to come speak with her.

29:37.234 --> 29:40.571
No. I know her and an ambush
will just humiliate her.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.364
This has to be dealt with now.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.575
If she overloads on protein again,
it could kill her.

29:45.701 --> 29:46.702
(CLICKS TONGUE) God...

29:47.828 --> 29:50.247
Tell you what, I'll let you
speak with Joy first.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.792
Come on.

30:02.510 --> 30:03.511
I can't do this.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.722
Joy doesn't binge
in the middle of the night.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.976
I've been slipping protein powder
in her green smoothies.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.229
Why?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.606
I read protein powder
can make you gain weight

30:15.689 --> 30:17.066
by increasing your overall caloric...

30:17.149 --> 30:18.484
Why were you trying
to make Joy gain weight?

30:18.567 --> 30:19.944
I wasn't trying to make her gain weight.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.987
I was trying to keep her
from losing weight.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.324
I know it sounds insane.
And criminal.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.076
I wasn't gonna do it forever.

30:27.159 --> 30:32.289
Just long enough for... for her
to get discouraged and stop dieting.

30:32.373 --> 30:33.749
And I never meant to hurt her.

30:35.292 --> 30:38.087
I was scared that if Joy lost weight,
she'd leave me.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.718
You need to tell Joy the truth or I will.

30:47.930 --> 30:51.976
(LAUGHING) So, Alice and I
were talking, Doc.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.103
Yeah.
And while we really would like

30:54.186 --> 30:55.854
to name our son in your honor...

30:55.938 --> 30:58.649
Aw.
We're just not sure about Crockett.

30:58.732 --> 31:02.236
(LAUGHS) It is a statement,
that's for sure.

31:02.903 --> 31:06.907
(COUGHS) I don't suppose you have
a middle name that's a little more...

31:06.991 --> 31:07.992
(WHEEZING)

31:08.075 --> 31:11.787
Nick? Nick, honey, what's wrong?

31:12.580 --> 31:15.958
Okay. Take slow, deep breaths.
Nice and easy, okay?

31:16.041 --> 31:19.378
Nick?
Nick, bud? Talk to me.

31:19.461 --> 31:20.921
Let's get a mask on him.

31:21.005 --> 31:22.423
(WHEEZING)

31:22.506 --> 31:25.634
Let's go. Come on. Drop it. Hey, buddy.

31:25.718 --> 31:28.137
Heartrate's 133. BP's 77.
MARCEL: Nick?

31:28.220 --> 31:30.097
Nick, I need you to breathe.
Hey, Nick? Nick.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.182
He's in V–Fib.
Nick, honey, wake up.

31:32.266 --> 31:33.976
Nick? No pulse. All right, let's go.
Bag him.

31:34.727 --> 31:36.145
Milligram of epi. Let's go, come on.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.355
Oh, my God!
Paddles and charge to 200.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.025
ALICE: Oh, my God.
Nick?

31:41.942 --> 31:43.360
Charged. Clear!

31:43.444 --> 31:44.445
Let's go. Come on.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.657
(MACHINES BEEPING)

31:49.617 --> 31:52.911
All right. Another round of epi.
Let's go. Charge to 200.

31:52.995 --> 31:54.371
NURSE: Charged. Clear!

31:58.292 --> 32:00.002
MARCEL: Nick? Nick, can you hear me?

32:00.085 --> 32:02.630
I am right here, honey... Nick.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.423
Epi and charge. Let's go.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.216
Clear!

32:13.223 --> 32:14.600
ALICE: You'll be fine.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.143
He's asystole.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.688
No. Come on, Nick.

32:30.908 --> 32:31.950
No.

32:32.743 --> 32:34.078
No.

32:34.161 --> 32:35.162
No.

32:38.540 --> 32:41.377
No. No. No.

32:43.962 --> 32:47.091
Time of death, 16:54.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.843
(SOBBING)

32:54.723 --> 32:55.724
ALICE: Nick!

32:57.059 --> 32:58.102
Nick!

33:02.231 --> 33:04.608
Thank you so much, Ms. Gastern. Bye–bye.

33:06.694 --> 33:08.112
DCFS is gonna start looking

33:08.195 --> 33:10.406
for a new foster placement
for Auggie tomorrow.

33:11.115 --> 33:12.116
Mmm.

33:14.702 --> 33:15.786
What about tonight?

33:15.869 --> 33:18.122
Well, I got him a bed on the peds floor.

33:18.205 --> 33:20.290
And since Earl is back
for the night shift,

33:20.374 --> 33:23.001
he promised that he would try to check in
on Auggie upstairs.

33:23.085 --> 33:27.756
That's good. Taxi's here. We should, uh...

33:28.674 --> 33:29.675
Right.

33:40.769 --> 33:44.815
Baby, I just, uh...

33:45.733 --> 33:47.860
Yeah. Okay.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.614
I'll call the airline
and the hotel. Reschedule.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.492
And we'll spend the night with Auggie.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.370
You know how amazing you are?

33:58.454 --> 34:00.205
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

34:01.665 --> 34:03.459
You're pretty amazing yourself,
Mr. Ben Campbell.

34:04.877 --> 34:07.546
I'm a lucky man.
Go ahead. And, yes, you are.

34:09.423 --> 34:10.424
Thank you.

34:11.592 --> 34:16.221
Joy, you should know what Max did
was a form of assault.

34:17.264 --> 34:20.309
And I can call CPD and you can
press charges against him.

34:20.392 --> 34:23.395
No, no. You don't have to call them.
I'm not pressing charges.

34:23.479 --> 34:25.981
Joy, he lied to you, betrayed your trust.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.399
You don't have to act
like nothing happened.

34:27.483 --> 34:30.277
No, I know what Max did was so messed up.

34:31.111 --> 34:32.279
But we talked it out.

34:32.362 --> 34:36.533
You know, and he was acting
from a place of fear and insecurity.

34:36.617 --> 34:40.662
And, you know, Max is a good person.

34:41.914 --> 34:42.956
I know his heart.

34:45.375 --> 34:46.376
Can we just go?

34:49.129 --> 34:50.130
Take care.

34:54.134 --> 34:57.179
Unbelievable.
If it were me, I'd be furious.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.764
Anyone would.
Really?

34:59.807 --> 35:01.809
Of course.
Then why aren't you?

35:03.018 --> 35:05.395
What? Ethan, I lied to you...

35:05.479 --> 35:07.397
Oh, God, April.
I betrayed your trust.

35:07.481 --> 35:08.899
Look, what do you want me to say?

35:08.982 --> 35:11.235
That I can't believe you kissed
someone else? Someone we work with?

35:11.318 --> 35:12.319
You know how crazy it makes me

35:12.402 --> 35:13.987
that I have to see that
son of a bitch every day?

35:14.071 --> 35:15.739
Is this what you wanna hear?
Yeah. I do.

35:15.823 --> 35:16.990
I wanna know what you're feeling.

35:17.074 --> 35:18.951
Why? Why couldn't you just tell me?

35:19.952 --> 35:22.329
Why did it take physically
harming yourself to come clean?

35:26.124 --> 35:27.125
Are you in love with him?

35:27.876 --> 35:30.254
What? No! Of course not.

35:30.337 --> 35:32.548
It was just a meaningless attraction.
I don't...

35:32.631 --> 35:34.716
Well, if it's so meaningless,
why are we even talking about it?

35:36.009 --> 35:39.513
Because you deserve to know everything.

35:40.973 --> 35:44.852
Ethan, I love you. I made a mistake.

35:44.935 --> 35:48.272
That day, when I found out
I couldn't have children...

35:48.355 --> 35:50.858
You pushed me away and ran into
another man's arms.

36:03.453 --> 36:04.454
Hey...

36:06.832 --> 36:10.002
You called it. Played out
just like you said it would.

36:11.295 --> 36:13.505
We don't know what killed Nick.

36:13.589 --> 36:16.133
He was tachycardic,
hypotensive, and desatting.

36:17.009 --> 36:19.928
Classic trifecta. It had to be a PE.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.680
If that's the case,

36:21.763 --> 36:23.807
then the clot could have been there
prior to the surgery.

36:23.891 --> 36:27.477
I mean, Nick had pretty much
been bedridden for months.

36:27.561 --> 36:29.855
Surgery caused it. End of story.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.149
You don't know that.

36:33.275 --> 36:38.030
You know, if I hadn't put that surgery
on the table,

36:38.113 --> 36:39.781
chances are he'd still be alive.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.037
Crockett.

36:48.123 --> 36:51.835
Sometimes in the ED, we get tunnel vision.

36:53.462 --> 36:55.589
All we can see is the patient
in front of us.

36:57.132 --> 37:00.302
But Nick could see past that.
Beyond his own benefit.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.638
And I think you did, too.

37:05.265 --> 37:08.518
You know, with new surgery,
the more you do it, the better you'll get,

37:08.602 --> 37:10.062
the more lives you'll save.

37:10.854 --> 37:12.314
Yeah, maybe you couldn't save Nick's,

37:13.690 --> 37:16.693
but maybe someday, you'll save his son's.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.407
Hey.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.495
We still on for the Green Mill, Crockett?

37:26.578 --> 37:28.455
The next set starts in an hour.

37:28.538 --> 37:29.539
Yeah, 'course, darling.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.503
Okay. Good night, Dr. Manning.

37:35.879 --> 37:36.880
Night.

37:46.932 --> 37:47.933
(CLEARS THROAT)

37:51.937 --> 37:53.355
Hey, Mom. You look nice.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.773
Hey, thank you.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.280
What's Dad doing here?

38:02.364 --> 38:03.740
I invited him.

38:07.369 --> 38:08.704
It's good to see you, son.

38:10.539 --> 38:11.540
If he's staying, I'm leaving.

38:12.833 --> 38:13.834
Sit down.

38:20.132 --> 38:24.803
Now, this cold war you've got going
with your father ends tonight.

38:24.886 --> 38:27.139
After what he did to you? Forget it.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.473
You don't know the full story.

38:31.852 --> 38:32.853
What are you talking about?

38:35.063 --> 38:42.070
Look, I thought I was protecting you
and David and Tara

38:42.154 --> 38:44.781
by not talking to you about the divorce.

38:45.907 --> 38:48.785
But it was painful.

38:48.869 --> 38:51.371
Yeah, and Dad caused that pain.

38:52.873 --> 38:56.418
Son, the end of any relationship,

38:56.501 --> 39:02.257
especially one with a 35–year history,
is complicated.

39:03.300 --> 39:07.220
But, the bottom line, Michael,
is you can spend your whole life

39:07.304 --> 39:10.766
looking back and pointing fingers.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.727
Or you could choose to move forward.

39:14.436 --> 39:18.774
Now, I don't know what's to come
of your father and me.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.278
But it's time for this family
to start healing.

39:24.529 --> 39:29.242
You need your father
and your father needs you.

39:40.504 --> 39:42.130
Let's start by having dinner.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.396
You wanna come up? I mean,
I cleared out my liquor cabinet,

39:58.480 --> 40:01.733
but I do have
a pretty stellar tea collection.

40:05.028 --> 40:07.656
But you know, if tea's not your thing,

40:07.739 --> 40:08.865
I can make a gin and tonic,

40:09.825 --> 40:10.826
sans the gin.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.577
No, it's not...

40:14.079 --> 40:15.747
I wanna come up, I do.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.876
I just wonder if that's a good idea.

40:21.962 --> 40:25.257
Okay.
You may be surprised to hear this,

40:25.340 --> 40:28.426
but there's actually very little
neurochemical difference

40:28.510 --> 40:30.178
between drug addiction...

40:30.262 --> 40:31.263
And romance addiction?

40:32.013 --> 40:35.433
And should something go wrong
inside the relationship,

40:35.517 --> 40:37.769
it increases the chances of relapse.

40:40.147 --> 40:42.482
Yeah.
I've been going to the meetings, Will.

40:42.566 --> 40:44.526
This stuff's been drilled into my head.

40:47.988 --> 40:50.574
So, what do we do?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.497
Let's go up and discuss it.

41:19.519 --> 41:21.521
