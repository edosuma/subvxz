WEBVTT

01:49.985 --> 01:51.112
Nice.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.868
Oh, almost.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.161
Go get it.

02:02.832 --> 02:03.874
Throw it in.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.713
Nice.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.425
It's okay. I got it.

02:32.528 --> 02:33.988
There's someone there.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.664
Go tell Mom.

03:07.646 --> 03:08.606
What?

03:09.440 --> 03:10.357
Where?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.276
What?

03:12.818 --> 03:15.029
Damn it!
I don't have a fucking car!

03:15.821 --> 03:16.780
Oh!

03:26.415 --> 03:27.541
Hey, Becky.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.126
<i>Mom, I need your car.
It's Steven!</i>

03:29.251 --> 03:30.419
Honey, what's wrong?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.129
It's Steven!
Please, I need your car!

03:32.254 --> 03:33.088
Please, hurry!

03:33.214 --> 03:34.131
Okay? Hurry!

03:34.256 --> 03:35.549
I'm coming right over.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.553
I'm sorry, Norma.
I have to go.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.131
<i>Becky!</i>

04:16.257 --> 04:17.967
Becky!
Becky, what's going on?

04:18.092 --> 04:19.468
- I hate him.
- Becky!

04:19.593 --> 04:21.136
- I hate him.
- What happened?

04:21.262 --> 04:22.721
- I hate him.
- Becky.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.890
Becky.

04:25.015 --> 04:25.975
Becky!

04:26.100 --> 04:28.060
Open!
Becky, don't!

04:28.185 --> 04:29.728
Becky, stop!

04:29.853 --> 04:31.063
Becky!

04:32.564 --> 04:34.316
Becky!
Becky, no!

04:37.403 --> 04:38.237
Becky, stop!

05:03.387 --> 05:04.680
Shelly!

05:04.805 --> 05:06.307
What the hell?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.685
Are you okay, sweetheart?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.855
Can you give me a ride
to the Double R, Carl?

05:13.647 --> 05:14.523
Mm.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.030
What the hell happened?

05:21.155 --> 05:23.115
Becky and Steven
are fighting again.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.450
Oh, God.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.336
Can't we go any faster, Carl?

05:35.461 --> 05:38.005
I want to get us there
in one piece, Shelly.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.174
Oh, Carl.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.510
I know there's been
trouble in that trailer.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.012
We've all heard it.

05:45.888 --> 05:49.850
And I feel for you
and your girl, okay, Shelly?

05:49.975 --> 05:51.060
Thank you.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.449
Shelly.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.910
<i>Norma, Becky took off.
I don't know where she went.</i>

06:08.035 --> 06:09.328
What should I do?

06:10.162 --> 06:11.789
<i>Why didn't you
just call Bobby?</i>

06:13.415 --> 06:15.000
<i>Shell?</i>

06:15.125 --> 06:16.668
<i>Shelly!</i>

06:16.794 --> 06:19.546
Maggie? Maggie!

06:19.671 --> 06:21.006
This is Carl.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.009
Uh, 10-17, copy that.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.470
Hello, Carl.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.180
Maggie, I got Shelly Briggs

06:28.305 --> 06:29.932
here in the truck with me.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.351
Could you patch us through
to Deputy Briggs?

06:32.476 --> 06:34.478
Hold on, please.
I'll put you through.

06:36.647 --> 06:37.731
<i>Shelly.</i>

06:37.856 --> 06:38.690
Thanks, Norma,
I'll call you back.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.275
Shelly.

06:43.779 --> 06:44.696
<i>This is Briggs.</i>

06:44.822 --> 06:46.240
Deputy Briggs.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.159
Bobby, it's Shelly.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.995
Becky took off with the car.

06:52.121 --> 06:53.038
<i>Whose car?</i>

06:53.163 --> 06:54.373
My car.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.125
I don't know where she went.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.710
Bobby, she's got a gun.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.463
Oh, God.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.235
Steven!

07:23.360 --> 07:25.112
Steven, I know you're in there!

07:26.488 --> 07:27.948
Fucking coward!

07:28.073 --> 07:28.907
God.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.244
Damn you, Steven!

07:32.369 --> 07:33.996
They've left.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.373
They left.
They just left.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.250
There's nobody in there!

07:38.375 --> 07:39.710
There's nobody in there!

07:45.132 --> 07:47.092
Fuck you, Steven!

08:13.160 --> 08:13.994
Sheriff's Department.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.996
What's your location,
please, ma'am?

08:16.121 --> 08:18.207
Sixteen-oh-one
Timberlake Drive?

08:18.332 --> 08:19.833
Someone's on the way.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.462
Sheriff's Department.
What's your location?

08:24.755 --> 08:26.089
Someone's on the way.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.302
Sheriff's Department.
What's your location?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.347
Someone's on the way.

08:35.641 --> 08:37.935
Sheriff's Department.
What's your location, please?

08:39.311 --> 08:40.521
Someone's on the way.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.736
Six twenty-five, 10-17.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.530
Copy that.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.805
This is the place?

09:20.686 --> 09:21.979
- Tammy?
- Yep?

09:22.104 --> 09:23.438
You go work
with Hastings.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.440
Find out exactly
where he went.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.067
This is as far as I go.

09:35.617 --> 09:36.952
William?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.287
William?

09:38.412 --> 09:40.122
Is this where you saw
Major Briggs?

09:44.626 --> 09:45.627
It is.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.881
How did you get inside?

09:51.466 --> 09:53.552
The hole in the fence
over there.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.434
How far in there did you go?

10:01.059 --> 10:03.437
About 15 or 20 feet.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.273
What happened after that?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.861
I don't remember
what happened.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.751
Gordon.

10:28.337 --> 10:29.421
I see it.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.133
Okay.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.847
This is the place.

10:39.765 --> 10:43.101
He went in through the fence here
about 15 or 20 feet.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.937
He can't remember
what happened after that.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.237
Think there's one in there, Albert?

10:55.697 --> 10:57.324
We'll soon find out.

10:59.534 --> 11:00.702
You cover us, Tammy.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.745
Got it.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.986
Well, I guess we found out.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.281
We sure did, Albert.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.005
Gordon.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.372
Ruth Davenport, I presume.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.215
Looks like coordinates
are written on her arm.

15:26.635 --> 15:28.053
You got a picture of it?

15:28.762 --> 15:29.930
Yeah.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.356
Oh!

15:39.481 --> 15:40.941
Oh, my God!

15:41.066 --> 15:42.317
Fuck!

15:48.573 --> 15:49.908
Oh, my God!

15:54.454 --> 15:57.165
Listen, I need
all available backup

15:57.290 --> 15:59.709
at 2240 Sycamore,

15:59.834 --> 16:01.544
2240 Sycamore.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.508
There's no backup for this.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.138
What the hell happened,
Macklay?

16:21.856 --> 16:23.149
He's dead.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.220
What do you want to do, Becky?

16:53.263 --> 16:54.723
I hate him.
I want out.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.391
You want a divorce?

16:59.894 --> 17:01.646
I don't know.
I love him.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.484
You're gonna have
to pay for the door

17:06.609 --> 17:07.902
and the damage
to the apartment.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.238
I'm not paying
for her apartment.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.823
- Becky.
- I'm not going to do it.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.199
I don't have any money, anyway!

17:14.743 --> 17:15.994
Honey,

17:16.119 --> 17:18.788
if I didn't work for the sheriff,
you'd be in jail right now.

17:19.664 --> 17:20.915
I'll loan you
the money.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.667
Ugh, no.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.961
I can't take any more
money from you, Mom.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.881
And he spent everything
you ever gave me, anyway.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.557
I'll loan you the money.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.231
But you gotta pay me back.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.691
And you gotta make this right.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.402
And we have to get you
out of that trailer

17:49.527 --> 17:50.820
and away from him.

17:51.988 --> 17:55.742
He's just going through
a bad time right now.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.160
Becky,

17:57.285 --> 17:59.537
the only reason
I haven't busted him

17:59.662 --> 18:01.372
is, I was hoping
he would come around

18:01.498 --> 18:03.166
for you.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.542
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.169
But it‒it's gonna happen.
I know it will.

18:06.294 --> 18:07.420
He's good inside.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.339
He goes out every day
looking for work.

18:09.464 --> 18:10.548
At least I thought he did.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.554
Carl said things aren't right
in that trailer.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.849
Has he ever hit you?

18:19.974 --> 18:20.809
Uh...

18:20.934 --> 18:22.102
n-no, no.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.436
He's not...

18:23.561 --> 18:24.729
like that.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.566
Come on.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.695
I hope you're right.

18:33.488 --> 18:36.366
From now on,
if he ever touches you

18:36.491 --> 18:39.452
or breaks the law in any way,

18:39.577 --> 18:41.037
I'm gonna bring him down.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.251
Look...

18:46.376 --> 18:49.003
Becky,

18:49.129 --> 18:53.716
we know that you're
a grown, married woman.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.637
But we're your parents.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.098
And we love you.

19:03.810 --> 19:04.894
And...

19:07.063 --> 19:09.983
...we just‒we don't want to lose you.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.535
Oh, w-when you
flew off the windshield,

19:20.660 --> 19:22.537
are you okay?
I'm sorry, Mom.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.038
- I'm okay.
- I didn't mean to do that.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.748
- I really didn't.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.167
And I'm sorry.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.753
You're staying
with me tonight, okay?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.153
See you later?

20:37.278 --> 20:38.529
Same place?

21:05.431 --> 21:06.516
Everybody down!
Get down!

21:08.101 --> 21:10.478
Toad, turn off the lights.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.147
What is this?

21:17.318 --> 21:19.362
Oh, my God, Russ!

21:21.948 --> 21:24.158
Russ, what the hell?

21:24.284 --> 21:25.785
Russ! Oh, my God!

21:25.910 --> 21:28.037
Ralph‒he's got a gun, Russ!

21:29.956 --> 21:32.125
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Russ!

21:32.250 --> 21:34.544
Did you put a gun
in this car?

21:34.669 --> 21:36.838
Damn you!
What were you thinking?

21:36.963 --> 21:38.631
It was in the front seat
in a box.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.216
I didn't know
it was a gun!

21:40.341 --> 21:42.176
He could have killed himself!

21:42.302 --> 21:44.887
He could have killed all of us!

21:45.013 --> 21:46.848
It was by my feet, Russ.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.599
I moved it to get it
out of the way.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.101
Do you think
I would have put it

21:50.226 --> 21:51.853
in the back seat of the car
with Ralph

21:51.978 --> 21:53.813
if I knew it was a gun?

21:53.938 --> 21:55.398
Are you a fucking moron?

21:55.523 --> 21:57.025
What is wrong with you?

21:57.150 --> 21:59.152
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

21:59.277 --> 22:00.361
I'm with the Twin Peaks
Sheriff's Department,

22:00.486 --> 22:01.612
Deputy Briggs.

22:02.697 --> 22:03.531
Please hand me that gun.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.450
Okay.

22:05.575 --> 22:06.534
Here.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.544
Now, I'm gonna need
identification

22:16.669 --> 22:18.379
from both of you, please.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.216
I was at Big Ed's Gas Farm.

23:04.217 --> 23:05.802
And you know what?

23:07.220 --> 23:09.180
I heard shots.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.143
That kid found
a gun, evidently,

23:14.268 --> 23:15.686
in the back
of this van

23:15.812 --> 23:17.855
and shot through the window
into the Double R.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.440
These are his parents,
I think.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.067
I need IDs
on both of them.

23:21.192 --> 23:22.610
Ma'am, please!

23:22.735 --> 23:24.904
I'm gonna try and stop this woman
from honking her horn

23:25.029 --> 23:25.863
and get this traffic moving.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.073
I got it, Bobby.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.077
Please, ma'am.
Ma'am, please.

23:34.914 --> 23:35.748
Please, ma'am‒

23:35.873 --> 23:38.000
What are you doing?

23:38.126 --> 23:40.461
We're trying to get home!

23:40.586 --> 23:41.796
We're already late.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.757
We're late for dinner.
It's way past 6:30.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.176
Why is this happening?

23:48.594 --> 23:52.181
I saw that gun
go shooting out the window.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.767
Her uncle is joining us.

23:54.892 --> 23:57.437
She hasn't seen him

23:57.562 --> 23:59.730
in a very long while.

23:59.856 --> 24:01.566
We're late!

24:01.691 --> 24:05.027
We've got miles to go!

24:05.153 --> 24:08.406
Please, we have to get home!

24:08.531 --> 24:10.741
She's sick!

24:16.998 --> 24:19.584
Aah! Aah!

24:19.709 --> 24:21.377
Oh, God!

24:23.921 --> 24:26.048
Aah! Aah! Aah!

24:26.174 --> 24:28.426
Oh! Oh.

24:28.551 --> 24:29.802
Oh! Oh!

24:31.262 --> 24:32.930
Aah! Aah!

24:34.682 --> 24:38.686
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

24:38.811 --> 24:43.691
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

24:43.816 --> 24:45.109
Aah! Aah!

24:45.234 --> 24:49.030
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

24:49.155 --> 24:51.824
Aah! Aah!

25:02.168 --> 25:04.795
By my reckoning,
this is where we're headed.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.466
But there's no road.
The road's gone.

25:09.759 --> 25:12.220
The information
that Major Briggs gave

25:12.345 --> 25:13.804
got me thinking.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.766
You'll understand a lot more

25:16.891 --> 25:18.518
when I explain my map.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.608
This map is very old,

25:25.733 --> 25:27.985
but it is always current.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.696
It's‒it's a living thing.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.243
This is where
Major Briggs' station was.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.203
This is Blue Pine Mountain

25:37.328 --> 25:41.040
and a‒a very revered sacred site.

25:41.165 --> 25:44.085
I think that the information
that the Major gave us

25:44.210 --> 25:45.795
is gonna take us here.

25:48.381 --> 25:51.175
Looks like a campfire.
What is this?

25:51.300 --> 25:55.638
It's not a campfire.
It's‒it's a‒a fire symbol.

25:55.763 --> 25:56.931
What's that mean?

25:57.056 --> 25:58.724
It's a...

25:58.849 --> 26:00.268
a type of fire.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.937
More like...

26:03.062 --> 26:05.147
like modern-day electricity.

26:06.649 --> 26:07.775
Good?

26:07.900 --> 26:10.945
Depends,
depends upon the intention,

26:11.070 --> 26:13.573
the intention behind the fire.

26:16.576 --> 26:19.078
The Major also gave us a date,

26:19.203 --> 26:21.455
day after tomorrow.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.000
If you read these stars,

26:24.125 --> 26:26.669
you find that same date,

26:26.794 --> 26:28.671
and it refers you to here.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.591
What is this?

26:31.716 --> 26:33.217
It's corn. It's fertility.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.469
But it's‒it's black,

26:35.595 --> 26:37.430
diseased or unnatural.

26:38.598 --> 26:39.640
Death.

26:44.687 --> 26:49.233
If you put these
two symbols together,

26:49.358 --> 26:50.651
you get this.

26:53.571 --> 26:54.989
Black fire.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.449
Correct.

27:02.788 --> 27:05.583
We saw this on that
little slip of paper

27:05.708 --> 27:08.836
we took out
of Major Briggs' tube.

27:08.961 --> 27:09.962
What is this?

27:12.131 --> 27:13.424
Frank...

27:14.592 --> 27:17.303
...you don't ever want
to know about that.

27:22.683 --> 27:23.934
Really?

27:25.227 --> 27:26.729
Really.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.864
<i>I don't know why
I'm even thinking about furniture.</i>

27:36.989 --> 27:39.659
<i>Andy and I
hardly ever get home.</i>

27:39.784 --> 27:41.410
What's up, Lucy?

27:41.535 --> 27:44.372
<i>Margaret Lanterman
for you on line two, Hawk.</i>

27:44.497 --> 27:47.333
<i>That's the one that's blinking
when I hang up.</i>

27:53.255 --> 27:55.007
Hello, Margaret.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.676
<i>Hawk?</i>

27:56.801 --> 27:58.469
Can you hear me?

27:58.594 --> 28:00.304
Yes, Margaret.

28:01.472 --> 28:04.975
Hawk, can you hear me?

28:05.101 --> 28:07.353
Yes, Margaret.

28:08.562 --> 28:11.065
You found something,
didn't you?

28:11.190 --> 28:12.900
It's just like you said.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.778
I'm sorry, I-I should
have let you know.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.032
What did you find, Hawk?

28:21.659 --> 28:24.036
Margaret, I can't tell you that.

28:25.955 --> 28:29.041
My log is afraid of fire.

28:30.710 --> 28:33.838
There's fire
where you are going.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.926
<i>Hawk,</i>

28:39.051 --> 28:42.805
<i>there's fire
where you are going.</i>

28:42.930 --> 28:45.224
Okay, Margaret.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.770
Good night, Hawk.

28:52.982 --> 28:53.983
Good night.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.610
And thank you, Margaret.

29:22.845 --> 29:24.013
What is it, Jesse?

29:24.138 --> 29:25.514
Sheriff Truman,

29:25.639 --> 29:27.975
are you interested
in seeing my new car?

29:29.310 --> 29:31.187
- It's a two-thousand‒
- Jesse.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.521
I'm in a meeting.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.732
Can I look at your new car
tomorrow?

29:34.857 --> 29:36.358
Okay.

29:36.484 --> 29:38.611
Thank you,
Sh-Sheriff Truman.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.457
Cat on a hot tin roof.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.001
It's never done that before.

29:57.588 --> 30:00.549
We're supposed
to get some coffee,

30:00.674 --> 30:02.927
but I don't think
that's a good idea.

30:03.052 --> 30:04.220
Coffee?

30:04.345 --> 30:06.096
I would like some coffee.

30:07.223 --> 30:08.724
Maybe some warm milk.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.062
For the cat.

30:15.397 --> 30:16.816
On the roof?

30:18.025 --> 30:19.527
Yes.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.154
The picture you took
of Ruth.

30:23.614 --> 30:25.491
I would like
to see it, Albert.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.352
Can I smoke in here?

30:54.353 --> 30:55.855
Smoke?

30:55.980 --> 30:57.982
Ask Macklay
when he gets back.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.776
But smoking's bad for you.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.653
I know.

31:02.778 --> 31:04.196
"Fuck you, Albert."

31:05.072 --> 31:06.198
That's right.

31:06.323 --> 31:07.783
Fuck you, Albert.

31:18.127 --> 31:21.630
What place do those
coordinates represent?

31:22.756 --> 31:24.592
Well, the last few digits
are smudged,

31:24.717 --> 31:27.469
but the numbers indicate
a small town in the north‒

31:29.221 --> 31:30.222
Ah.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.392
The policeman's dream.

31:45.613 --> 31:48.365
Thank you,
Detective Macklay.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.200
You're welcome.

31:50.326 --> 31:51.994
Hey, can I smoke in here?

31:52.119 --> 31:54.288
No, there's no smoking allowed.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.458
Detective Macklay,

31:57.583 --> 32:00.920
you know how good a cigarette
would taste with this coffee?

32:04.340 --> 32:05.633
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.551
Thank you.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.096
So...

32:15.184 --> 32:18.562
...no suspects
were found in the area.

32:18.687 --> 32:21.732
It's a positive ID
on Ruth Davenport.

32:23.692 --> 32:26.946
I don't suppose you found
Major Briggs' head anywhere.

32:28.697 --> 32:29.657
We looked.

32:29.782 --> 32:31.200
There's no trace.

32:31.325 --> 32:34.370
Nobody heard anything.
No shots.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.248
A bullet didn't
do that to Hastings.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.918
Yeah, they're still
cleaning the vehicle.

32:42.419 --> 32:45.047
We saw somebody,
Albert and I,

32:45.172 --> 32:49.969
out back, out back where
we found Ruth Davenport's body.

32:51.595 --> 32:52.888
What'd he look like?

32:53.973 --> 32:56.016
He looked like
a homeless man, uh...

32:56.141 --> 32:57.935
old clothes, beard,
wool cap.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.105
I think I saw
somebody like that

33:01.230 --> 33:02.940
getting out
of the police car.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.990
Uh, I-I could
be mistaken.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.868
Well, I was in the car.

33:14.994 --> 33:17.830
I-I didn't see anybody.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.290
I didn't see anyone either.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.919
Well, I-I said
I wasn't sure.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.715
Now I remember.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.467
I saw them...

33:30.592 --> 33:32.094
in a room.

33:33.053 --> 33:35.389
I saw the bearded men,

33:35.514 --> 33:38.100
the same type Albert and I saw.

33:39.184 --> 33:42.312
Dirty, bearded men in a room.

33:56.577 --> 34:00.039
Dougie,
come into my office, please.

34:01.749 --> 34:04.168
<i>Mr. Mullins,
Phil Bisby here.</i>

34:04.293 --> 34:06.462
<i>I got your coffee
and we'll be right in.</i>

34:06.587 --> 34:07.546
Good.

34:36.784 --> 34:39.453
All right, Mr. Mullins,
here's your coffee, sir.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.705
- Thank you, Phil.
- You're welcome.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.415
Sit down, Dougie.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.256
Just close the door
behind you

34:51.381 --> 34:52.382
when you go, Phil.

34:52.508 --> 34:53.550
Yes, sir.

35:05.229 --> 35:06.688
Dougie,

35:06.814 --> 35:09.024
now that I've had time
to think about this,

35:09.149 --> 35:11.318
it's clear that
your investigative work

35:11.443 --> 35:14.655
has exposed a ring
of organized crime

35:14.780 --> 35:17.074
and possible police corruption

35:17.199 --> 35:18.659
flowing through this office.

35:20.119 --> 35:21.995
The recent two attempts
on your life‒

35:22.121 --> 35:24.957
the blowing up your car,
the man trying to shoot you‒

35:25.082 --> 35:27.000
absolutely confirm this.

35:30.712 --> 35:33.757
Also, thanks to you,
we now know

35:33.882 --> 35:37.219
that the Mitchum brothers' case
was not arson

35:37.344 --> 35:40.347
but a legitimate claim
for an accidental fire,

35:40.472 --> 35:43.308
which indicates to me
that the Mitchum brothers,

35:43.433 --> 35:45.811
although alleged gangsters,

35:45.936 --> 35:48.021
are not part of this conspiracy,

35:48.147 --> 35:51.400
which suggests
that the shots are being called

35:51.525 --> 35:53.652
by somebody else.

35:56.864 --> 35:58.323
Somebody else.

35:59.575 --> 36:01.869
I think you're right, Dougie.

36:01.994 --> 36:04.329
And this is interesting.

36:04.454 --> 36:06.290
The Mitchums just called me,

36:06.415 --> 36:10.043
wanting to have
a personal sit-down with you.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.962
Now, normally,

36:12.087 --> 36:13.714
I wouldn't put one of my agents

36:13.839 --> 36:15.799
into the ring
with guys like this,

36:15.924 --> 36:17.718
but since you uncovered

36:17.843 --> 36:20.012
and righted the wrong
on their behalf,

36:20.137 --> 36:22.514
they are gonna be ecstatic

36:22.639 --> 36:24.933
when you deliver to them

36:25.058 --> 36:29.897
this $30-million check.

36:30.022 --> 36:31.815
I know what you're thinking.

36:31.940 --> 36:34.526
You're thinking,
"A $30-million payout

36:34.651 --> 36:37.988
for a firm our size, that has
to be catastrophic," right?

36:39.907 --> 36:41.283
Catastrophic, right.

36:41.408 --> 36:44.036
But Battling Bud

36:44.161 --> 36:46.788
always punched
above his weight class.

36:46.914 --> 36:48.916
I took out a secondary policy

36:49.041 --> 36:51.210
to cover our play on this one,

36:51.335 --> 36:53.587
which, because it
truly was an accident,

36:53.712 --> 36:56.715
will cover our potential loss
and then some.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.467
Bushnell double down.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.011
Bushnell double down.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.431
Nobody keeps Battling Bud
on the ropes for long.

37:15.609 --> 37:17.861
They want to see you at 5:30.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.743
They're sending a car.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.771
He's just coming out
of the bathroom now.

38:46.575 --> 38:47.701
All right...

38:49.244 --> 38:50.495
Rodney.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.082
I had a dream.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.003
Did ya?

38:58.128 --> 39:00.005
Had it all fuckin' night.

39:02.090 --> 39:05.177
I dreamt about killing
that Douglas Jones fuck.

39:08.889 --> 39:10.682
I just hate him so bad.

39:14.144 --> 39:15.979
I can't wait
to kill this guy.

39:23.070 --> 39:24.780
Can you last
three more hours?

39:24.905 --> 39:26.031
Barely.

39:33.622 --> 39:35.040
I can't eat this.

39:55.602 --> 39:58.522
Dougie, it's 5:30.
Where are you going?

40:37.018 --> 40:38.854
You've got the check,
don't you?

40:43.483 --> 40:45.819
Yeah, you're all set.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.028
Where you taking him?

40:47.154 --> 40:47.988
Santino's.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.948
Oh, you're gonna like that.

40:51.658 --> 40:53.743
I'm in your corner, champ.

40:53.869 --> 40:55.162
Knock 'em dead.

41:03.462 --> 41:04.713
Dead.

41:31.323 --> 41:32.449

43:13.967 --> 43:15.677
We're about to rid ourselves
of an asshole

43:15.802 --> 43:18.763
who has majorly, <i>majorly</i>
fucked us over.

43:20.432 --> 43:22.434
Well, he nailed
Ike the Spike for us.

43:22.559 --> 43:24.144
He didn't do that for us.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.313
Plus, he lost our 30 million,
and then

43:26.438 --> 43:29.482
he takes our casino
for 472 grand.

43:31.359 --> 43:32.861
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
I know. You're right.

43:32.986 --> 43:33.987
You're damn right
I'm right.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.280
I know.

44:11.650 --> 44:12.651
What?

44:15.320 --> 44:16.404
My dream.

44:16.529 --> 44:18.198
Ah, the dream again.

44:18.323 --> 44:19.616
In the dream‒

44:23.161 --> 44:25.163
In the dream,

44:25.288 --> 44:28.166
your Candie cut
was completely healed.

44:28.291 --> 44:30.001
What?

44:30.126 --> 44:31.961
The cut Candie gave you.

44:32.629 --> 44:33.838
How can that be?

44:36.508 --> 44:37.842
- Come here.
- No, no, stop.

44:37.967 --> 44:39.010
- Bradley, stop it.
- Come here. Hold still.

44:39.135 --> 44:39.969
- What are you doing?
- Easy.

44:40.095 --> 44:42.263
Stop it. It's gonna‒

44:48.603 --> 44:50.188
I'll be damned.

44:51.940 --> 44:52.941
How‒

44:53.066 --> 44:54.192
Yeah.

44:55.568 --> 44:56.695
There's more.

45:01.282 --> 45:02.909
But I can't remember.

46:37.837 --> 46:38.963
See ya later, Al.

46:40.632 --> 46:41.925
No, wait, wait.

46:42.050 --> 46:43.426
Hold on a minute.

46:43.551 --> 46:44.469
What?

46:45.845 --> 46:48.431
- What?
- Come here.

46:48.556 --> 46:50.058
Come around here.

46:53.102 --> 46:54.813
You see that box
that he's holding there?

46:54.938 --> 46:55.772
Yeah?

46:57.273 --> 46:58.316
That was in my dream.

46:58.441 --> 47:00.068
- Ah, fuck.
- No.

47:00.193 --> 47:02.570
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

47:04.906 --> 47:06.950
There's something
in that box.

47:07.700 --> 47:11.996
And if that something
is what I saw in my dream,

47:12.121 --> 47:13.748
we can't kill him.

47:13.873 --> 47:14.874
What the fuck
are you talking‒

47:14.999 --> 47:17.126
No, I'm not kidding, Rodney.

47:19.963 --> 47:23.925
If he's got
this one certain thing

47:24.050 --> 47:26.219
that's in that box,

47:26.344 --> 47:30.098
it means we can't kill him.

47:30.223 --> 47:31.140
Why?

47:31.266 --> 47:34.352
It means he's not
our enemy, Rodney.

47:34.477 --> 47:36.104
How the fuck
can you know that?

47:36.229 --> 47:38.940
I-I'm just telling you
what was in the dream.

47:40.233 --> 47:43.528
But it's gotta be
this one certain thing.

47:44.529 --> 47:45.530
What?

47:47.156 --> 47:48.950
Rodney,
it's a million-in-one shot,

47:49.075 --> 47:51.494
but if it's in there,
you got‒

47:51.619 --> 47:53.037
you gotta promise me.

47:54.289 --> 47:55.665
Listen to me.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.709
We gotta be together on this.

47:59.252 --> 48:00.169
Okay.

48:00.295 --> 48:01.963
We won't kill him.

48:02.088 --> 48:03.923
Okay, enough.
What is it?

48:11.723 --> 48:12.682
All right.

48:15.435 --> 48:17.854
Okay.
What the fuck?

48:17.979 --> 48:20.440
In the box there,

48:20.565 --> 48:22.233
is that a cherry pie?

48:24.193 --> 48:25.194
Cherry pie.

48:40.209 --> 48:42.629
Cherry pie!

48:46.215 --> 48:47.926
Frisk him just in case.

48:56.726 --> 48:58.227
Doesn't even have a wallet.

49:05.276 --> 49:06.736
It's addressed to us.

49:08.988 --> 49:10.114
Open it.

49:40.770 --> 49:42.689
Oh, my God!

49:45.566 --> 49:48.319
Holy...

49:49.404 --> 49:50.738
I love this guy!

49:53.449 --> 49:54.534
Dougie?

49:56.619 --> 49:57.745
Dougie Jones.

49:57.870 --> 50:00.373
- What a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

50:08.548 --> 50:12.176
You mean to say
your kid doesn't have one?

50:13.928 --> 50:15.596
No gym set?

50:15.722 --> 50:17.473
No gym set.

50:17.598 --> 50:19.350
Jeez.

50:19.475 --> 50:23.062
Even our fucking
orphanage had a gym set.

50:23.187 --> 50:25.606
Every kid
should have a gym set.

50:25.732 --> 50:26.899
There you go, brother.

50:27.025 --> 50:27.859
Yeah.

50:29.485 --> 50:30.361
A toast.

50:33.781 --> 50:36.951
Oh‒
Dougie.

50:41.998 --> 50:43.374
Here's to you, Dougie.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.467
Mmm.

50:52.592 --> 50:53.885
Mmm.

51:19.368 --> 51:21.454
Mr. Jackpots!

51:21.579 --> 51:23.414
Oh.

51:23.539 --> 51:25.708
This is the man
I told you about.

51:27.376 --> 51:29.420
I wanted to see you again.

51:29.545 --> 51:31.255
I've thought of you
every day,

51:31.380 --> 51:32.924
what you did for me.

51:33.049 --> 51:35.593
You changed my life.

51:35.718 --> 51:37.804
This is my dear son,
Denver.

51:37.929 --> 51:40.014
He's back
in my life again.

51:40.139 --> 51:42.433
I have a little dog.

51:42.558 --> 51:44.477
I have a house.

51:45.353 --> 51:48.648
I have
my life back again.

51:48.773 --> 51:51.275
How can I ever thank you?

51:54.403 --> 51:57.406
I hope you realize
what a special person

51:57.532 --> 51:59.784
you having dining with you.

52:01.494 --> 52:03.287
He saved my life.

52:04.455 --> 52:06.249
Sure saved us a lot too.

52:11.087 --> 52:12.296
Thank you.

52:12.421 --> 52:14.423
Thank you,
Mr. Jackpots.

52:14.549 --> 52:16.467
I'm so thankful I got

52:16.592 --> 52:19.762
a chance to say
thank you again.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.433
Thank you again.

52:35.903 --> 52:37.697
- Ah.
- Ah.

52:37.822 --> 52:39.532
Here it is.

52:41.617 --> 52:43.161
- Ah.
- Ah.

52:43.286 --> 52:44.579
Finally.

52:44.704 --> 52:46.831
And here are the girls.

52:50.668 --> 52:51.794
Candie.

52:53.004 --> 52:54.505
Candie?

52:55.506 --> 52:56.465
Candie, look at me.

52:59.886 --> 53:01.137
Where have you been?

53:09.562 --> 53:10.521
Candie.

53:18.196 --> 53:21.449
There was so much traffic
on the Strip.

53:22.074 --> 53:23.826
It was incredible.

53:25.661 --> 53:28.831
There were cars everywhere.

53:43.679 --> 53:44.722
Mmm.

53:51.854 --> 53:53.397
This pie is so damn good.

53:55.441 --> 53:56.525
Damn good.

54:02.031 --> 54:03.115
A toast.

54:08.246 --> 54:09.747
Dougie.

54:14.710 --> 54:17.421
Here's to the pie
that saved your life, Dougie.

54:17.546 --> 54:19.632
And our money.

54:27.807 --> 54:29.016
Mm-hmm.

54:37.566 --> 54:38.567
Candie.

54:40.653 --> 54:41.487
Candie.

54:43.656 --> 54:46.409
Another piece of pie
for our friend.

54:56.836 --> 54:58.087
Friend.
