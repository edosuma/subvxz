{\an5}Holy shit! I thought
the Blue Scorpion was a myth.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.279
{\an5}Dates back to 1952.
It's from Cuba.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.156
{\an5}Che Guevara was looking
for that gun.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.826
{\an5}It was made by this guy,
Eulogio Cienfuegos.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.371
{\an5}The legend is,
you don't find it, it finds you.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.458
{\an5}We can get you, like, $25,000 to
$50,000 for the Blue Scorpion.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.959
Okay. I mean, whatever.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.462
{\an1}I just want to get the
bloody thing out of my life.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.256
{\an8}So, if you... Fucking shit!

12:37.339 --> 12:39.258
{\an8}Oh, my God! Are you all right?

12:37.339 --> 12:39.258
{\an8}What the...?

12:42.595 --> 12:43.679
Are you there, brother?

12:43.762 --> 12:44.805
Hey...

12:43.762 --> 12:44.805
{\an1}Shit.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.682
...are you okay?

12:46.765 --> 12:48.517
Oh... Yeah.

12:48.601 --> 12:52.354
I'm all right, I'm okay,
I'm all right. Fuck.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.649
{\an5}Jesus Christ, was there
a round in the chamber?

12:55.733 --> 12:58.027
I don't know.

12:58.110 --> 12:58.986
{\an5}Okay.

12:58.110 --> 12:58.986
(dog barking outside)

12:59.069 --> 13:00.863
{\an5}Send me all your information
and a picture

13:00.946 --> 13:03.324
{\an5}of the gun.
I'll take care of everything.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.367
{\an5}Once it's sold, and if you
don't have a license,

13:05.451 --> 13:07.369
{\an5}you'll have to ship it
by carrier.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.369
Yeah.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.829
But if you do, don't forget

13:08.913 --> 13:11.040
{\an5}to punch a small hole
in the box so some light

13:11.123 --> 13:13.584
can get in. Legend is,

13:13.667 --> 13:16.629
{\an5}the Blue Scorpion's
afraid of the dark.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.215
Where do I send my information?

13:19.298 --> 13:22.176
{\an5}To me, Bob Jeff,
at the gun superstore dot com.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.136
{\an5}P.O. Box 5252...

13:22.259 --> 13:24.136

13:24.220 --> 13:27.806
Did you just say "Jeff"?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.750
I-I'm sorry,
could you remind me...

13:54.833 --> 13:56.210
Your research project is?

13:56.293 --> 13:57.878
"Animism in contemporary China."

14:03.342 --> 14:04.927
{\an1}This-this research
project is--

14:05.010 --> 14:07.263
Sorry, excuse me.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.806
This...

14:08.889 --> 14:11.100
This research project
is-is really messing

14:11.183 --> 14:13.978
{\an4}with my head,
Dr. Storck. Um...

14:11.183 --> 14:13.978
(cell phone buzzing)

14:14.061 --> 14:16.063
You know how animism

14:16.146 --> 14:18.107
is, like...

14:16.146 --> 14:18.107
Yeah.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.067
{\an1}...the belief that
there's a-a spirit in,

14:20.150 --> 14:22.111
in every single thing,

14:22.194 --> 14:24.446
and-and even inanimate
objects have a soul?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.156
Yeah, I know what it is, Grace.
(chuckles)

14:26.240 --> 14:28.742
(chuckles) Well, it's, like,

14:28.826 --> 14:33.122
{\an1}nothing talks to me
or anything like that, but

14:33.205 --> 14:35.416
I-I can't help feel
that all my stuff--

14:35.499 --> 14:37.126
{\an1}my shoes,

14:37.209 --> 14:40.004
toothbrush, hats--
are all, like,

14:40.087 --> 14:42.464
{\an1}friends.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.799
Do you ever have that?

14:43.882 --> 14:45.968
(laughs) No.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.095
And you shouldn't either.

14:48.178 --> 14:50.472
{\an5}(laughs)

14:48.178 --> 14:50.472
{\an3}That's, um,
I think what you're

14:50.556 --> 14:53.058
experiencing
is anthropomorphism,

14:53.142 --> 14:56.186
{\an3}attributing human properties
to inanimate objects,

14:56.270 --> 14:59.023
which is different from animism,
which is a religious belief,

14:59.106 --> 15:02.359
as I'm sure you know.
I wouldn't worry.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.654
It's dri--
It's driving me crazy.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.616
It's a little late in the term
to be changing subjects.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.160
(cell phone buzzing)

15:11.243 --> 15:12.244
What the... F...

15:12.328 --> 15:16.540
{\an1}Okay, sir, when I leave my dorm,
nothing can be, like,

15:16.624 --> 15:19.501
{\an3}left by itself. Like, if
my boots are over by the bed

15:19.585 --> 15:21.045
{\an1}and my gym shoes
are in the closet,

15:21.128 --> 15:24.757
I-I feel like they're--
I don't know-- lonely.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.510
And I-I have to make sure that
everything is grouped together

15:28.594 --> 15:31.680
{\an1}or I feel bad that they
might be afraid of the dark,

15:31.764 --> 15:34.683
{\an1}so I leave
the light on.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.769
{\an1}(voice fading):
I-I go back to my dorm...

15:41.023 --> 15:42.816
{\an1}It's just because
of this stupid project.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.526
It's the project,
and I'm sorry, but I can't--

15:44.610 --> 15:47.196
{\an4}I-I need to change
the subject.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.196
Okay.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.366
{\an1}Thank you so much.
My shoes thank you, too.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.701

15:50.449 --> 15:52.701
Jeff Storck?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.828
Oh, I'm sorry. I need
to prepare for a lecture.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.039
I'm Anne's attorney.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.339
Fuck off.
Your name is Jeff, too?

16:05.422 --> 16:08.050
(chuckles)
That's great, though, Jeff.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.552
{\an1}We can begin negotiations
from a point of commonality.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.180
Can you just ease off?

16:13.263 --> 16:15.015
Can you just...
Please, please.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.893
{\an3}This isn't, this isn't
a good time for me. I, um,

16:17.976 --> 16:21.271
my father just passed away,
and he didn't do a will,

16:21.355 --> 16:24.358
so the whole estate
is fucked up, you know?

16:24.441 --> 16:25.943
Maybe we can do this
another day?

16:26.026 --> 16:29.738
Yeah, sure. If any of that
estate is left to you, uh,

16:29.822 --> 16:32.074
{\an1}be advised that half of it
now belongs to Anne.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.034
So if you need
any help at all...

16:34.118 --> 16:38.122
{\an3}I can make all of your
troubles go away.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.668
You have my card.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.221
(cell phone buzzing)

16:59.810 --> 17:01.645
{\an5}Stop calling me.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.645
GUN BROKER (over phone):
Hey, J...

17:01.729 --> 17:02.938
{\an5}Hey, Jeff. It's Bob Jeff.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.938
Just fucking stop!

17:03.021 --> 17:05.773
When I think the time is right
to get rid of the fucking thing,

17:05.858 --> 17:07.734
you'll be the first one
to know it, do you understand?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.611
{\an5}There's only been seven owners
of the Blue Scorpion,

17:09.694 --> 17:11.613
{\an5}including you.
I have people lining up

17:11.696 --> 17:14.282
{\an5}willing to lay down $100,000
for this gun.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.286
{\an5}If we sell this thing,
all our dreams will come true.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.288

more than anyone.

one thing in return:

20:53.961 --> 20:58.131
{\an1}Light.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.134
It is afraid of the dark.

(indistinct chatter)

21:21.071 --> 21:22.239
Sorry.

Hello. Good afternoon.

I'd like to

I don't have a lot of experience

21:39.131 --> 21:40.507
with this.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.717
You need to rent a gun?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.886
No. No, I have one.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.889
{\an4}Hello.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.889
Can I see the gun in order
to determine if it's safe

21:47.973 --> 21:49.433
to fire in the range?

21:49.516 --> 21:51.393
Yeah.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.404
{\an1}No. No, please,
don't, sorry.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.114
Just don't... don't.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.574
{\an3}Have you ever fired
this gun before?

22:05.657 --> 22:07.034
No. No, I haven't.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.618
And I only need
to shoot it once.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.579
{\an1}So...

22:08.702 --> 22:10.579
{\an3}Why?

22:10.662 --> 22:13.165
Why? Uh... because then
I'm gonna sell it.

22:13.248 --> 22:13.999
Why don't you
just sell it?

22:14.082 --> 22:15.250
{\an3}Why do you have
to fire it first?

22:18.170 --> 22:21.089
Um... you know, it--
(clears throat)

22:21.173 --> 22:24.926
...it's not so much about
the shooting of the gun.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.012
It's more that the shooting
of the gun

22:27.095 --> 22:28.764
will destroy a bullet.

22:28.847 --> 22:29.931
A certain bullet.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.433
(chuckles) No, but--

22:31.516 --> 22:33.226
trust me, I'll be

22:33.310 --> 22:36.229

the house.

Yeah.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.267

...Item 38.
Fender electric bass.

No! No!

28:07.644 --> 28:09.479

New York is
an equitable distribution state.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.447

such a valuable item

28:19.531 --> 28:22.575

28:30.208 --> 28:32.127

28:30.208 --> 28:32.127
Well, bass guitars played
at both Monterey Pop

28:32.210 --> 28:33.461

are very rare...

28:33.545 --> 28:34.796

the bass.
