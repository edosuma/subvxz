00:00.134 --> 00:05.037
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:05.039 --> 00:07.940
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.376 --> 00:10.542
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.544 --> 00:11.877
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:11.879 --> 00:15.781
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become Superman.</i>

00:16.217 --> 00:17.950
<i> And so I hide my powers</i>

00:17.952 --> 00:22.054
<i>until recently,</i>
<i>when an accident forced me</i>
<i>to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.556 --> 00:26.125
<i> To most people,</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:29.895
<i>But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i>adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.897 --> 00:31.864
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.866 --> 00:34.733
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.703 --> 00:38.237
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.239 --> 00:40.239
<i> Previously on </i> Supergirl...

00:40.674 --> 00:42.708
Kara: <i> Ever since</i>
<i> I was adopted,</i>

00:42.710 --> 00:44.543
I've felt the need
to help people,

00:44.545 --> 00:46.412
and tonight
I got that chance.

00:46.414 --> 00:49.648
I know I'm not
your mom, sweetheart.
But you're safe here.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.818
When you asked me
to join the deo,
I didn't hesitate.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.587
Because you told me
that together we were
going to save the world.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.157
Except saving the world
means everybody.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.175
(Grunting)

01:19.580 --> 01:21.246
(Growling)

01:23.451 --> 01:24.817
(Grunting)

01:26.287 --> 01:27.352
(Shouting)

01:29.256 --> 01:30.656
Man: Move, move, move.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.426
Man: Let's go!

01:38.132 --> 01:39.498
(Supergirl grunts)

01:44.605 --> 01:45.771
Alex on earphones:
<i> Where are you?</i>

01:45.773 --> 01:46.805
Busy.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.879
(Bones cracking)

01:53.881 --> 01:55.547
You promised me
that you were gonna be here.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.849
(Grunting continues)

02:02.490 --> 02:03.989
And I will be.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.391
Just dealing with an
alien prisoner who got loose.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.728
(Both grunting)

02:18.839 --> 02:20.072
(Groaning)

02:20.074 --> 02:21.206
(Panting)

02:21.208 --> 02:22.241
(Alarm blaring)

02:24.478 --> 02:25.811
(Breathing heavily)

02:26.147 --> 02:27.546
He was tough.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.047
She.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.182
Oh.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.517
Respect.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.020
Any chance I can have
the rest of the day off?

02:38.759 --> 02:40.359
-Hey!
-Alex: Oh, finally!

02:40.361 --> 02:41.426
Nice to see you, too.

02:41.428 --> 02:45.030
Look, this big,
havoc-wreaking,
lady-beast thing broke free.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.331
Happens to the best of us.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.201
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm freaking out.

02:49.203 --> 02:53.005
Alex, I have seen you take
down a human-sized bug
without a weapon.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.940
This is going to be fine.

02:54.942 --> 02:58.443
Last year, she was mad at me
for you not dating enough.

02:58.445 --> 03:02.781
Okay? I can't even imagine
what she's gonna do to me for
you coming out as Supergirl.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.116
She seemed fine
on the phone.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.885
-At least she's making pie.
-Yeah.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.687
I'm sure your favorite.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.856
Chocolate pecan pie is the
best dessert in the galaxy.

03:10.858 --> 03:14.393
And as someone who's been
to twelve different planets,
I mean that literally.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.460
(Knocking on door)

03:15.462 --> 03:16.895
Alex: Oh, god.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.131
-No, you need
to change out of that...
-It's fine. It's fine.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.968
-Kara: (Excitedly) Eliza!
-My girls!

03:22.970 --> 03:26.471
Oh, my best, favorite,
wonderful girls!

03:26.473 --> 03:27.573
Both: Oh...

03:27.575 --> 03:28.941
Alex, come here.

03:28.943 --> 03:31.210
-It's so good to be here.
-Oh!

03:31.212 --> 03:33.078
You both look so great.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.782
You always
looked great in blue.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.484
And you look
a little tired, sweetie.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.753
-Is the lab keeping you busy?
-Yeah.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.089
-How was your flight?
-Oh, it was fine.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.058
Um, it was a little bumpy.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.593
Oh, I hate when that happens.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.329
I hit some crazy air pockets
when I was flying
back from the...

03:50.331 --> 03:51.563
The...

03:51.565 --> 03:52.998
The place I was at.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.833
You're doing great, Kara.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.402
You really...
Do you really think so, mom?

03:57.671 --> 03:58.737
Of course.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.272
(Sighs)

04:03.110 --> 04:06.278
This is Leslie Willis,
coming to you alive

04:06.280 --> 04:08.847
and wired from catco Plaza.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.850
The week of Thanksgiving,
which means...

04:12.419 --> 04:17.456
Ah, it is time for my
annual list of
things I am not grateful for,

04:17.458 --> 04:21.260
and this year's list
is only one item,

04:22.463 --> 04:23.528
Supergirl.

04:24.131 --> 04:27.199
<i> The blue-and-red</i>
<i> abscessed tooth</i>

04:27.201 --> 04:30.535
<i> in the otherwise gleaming</i>
<i> smile that is national city!</i>

04:31.138 --> 04:34.006
How much do I despise,
I mean loathe,

04:34.008 --> 04:37.042
her whole, "look at me,
I'm a-dork-able" thing.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.511
And that hideous, like,

04:39.513 --> 04:43.048
rejected-from-the-Olympics
figure skating outfit
she wears?

04:43.050 --> 04:46.652
<i> I mean, a skirt and tights?</i>
<i> Puh-lease.</i>

04:47.154 --> 04:51.290
<i> Seems like overkill,</i>
<i> especially since no one is</i>
<i> trying to get in there.</i>

04:51.292 --> 04:52.724
<i> And who would that be?</i>

04:52.726 --> 04:57.229
<i> You know, who's </i> hombre
<i> enough to puncture</i>
<i> the chastity belt of steel?</i>

04:57.898 --> 05:00.165
<i> Or is what's required</i>
<i> a softer touch?</i>

05:00.167 --> 05:03.402
<i> I mean, she does kind of</i>
<i> give off a sapphic vibe,</i>

05:03.404 --> 05:06.571
<i> with that big ol' butch</i>
<i> "s" chest plate.</i>

05:06.573 --> 05:08.373
<i> I mean, how would that</i>
<i> even work with an alien?</i>

05:08.375 --> 05:09.975
<i> I mean, is everything</i>
<i> the same down there,</i>

05:09.977 --> 05:11.710
<i> or are we talking tentacles?</i>

05:11.712 --> 05:14.046
<i> Maybe it's time for a break.</i>

05:14.815 --> 05:16.148
<i> Or a makeover.</i>

05:18.519 --> 05:20.018
So, how was
breakfast with your mom?

05:20.020 --> 05:23.422
Foster mom. And great.
She's amazing.

05:24.024 --> 05:27.993
But Alex keeps waiting for
this, like, bomb to go off.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.495
And maybe
I'm oblivious, but...

05:30.497 --> 05:31.596
What?

05:31.598 --> 05:35.100
It's just... it's nice when
we talk about a metaphoric
bomb for a change.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.936
So, have you figured out
what you're doing
for Thanksgiving?

05:38.205 --> 05:39.938
Yeah, uh, orphan Thanksgiving.

05:40.441 --> 05:43.108
Literally, thai food
and <i> orphan black </i> marathon.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.443
Alone?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.111
What about your family?

05:47.147 --> 05:48.613
Core wound, Kara.

05:48.615 --> 05:49.781
Friends?

05:51.819 --> 05:53.185
-Winn!
-What?

05:53.187 --> 05:54.286
-No!
-Yes!

05:54.288 --> 05:56.455
No, that's crazy!
You're coming over.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.723
We're gonna
have a friendsgiving.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.924
Oh, you don't have to do that.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.125
Well, I want to. Seriously.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.361
You can be a buffer
between Alex and Eliza.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.097
And we can watch
<i> orphan black </i> after.

06:05.632 --> 06:09.067
What is Leslie Willis
doing in cat's office?

06:10.137 --> 06:12.437
Uh, you have super-hearing.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.438
(Telephone ringing)

06:15.409 --> 06:17.576
Cat: <i> I caught your</i>
<i> broadcast yesterday,</i>

06:17.578 --> 06:19.978
I warned you about
going after Supergirl.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.280
You're always warning me
about something.
That's our dynamic.

06:22.649 --> 06:24.383
<i> You tell me</i>
<i> I'm crossing a line.</i>

06:24.385 --> 06:26.318
A week later,
there's a new line to cross.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.721
I discovered you in that
shoebox of a radio station.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.790
I mentored you to
the best of my abilities.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.992
And for the most part,
I am proud of that.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.329
But going after a young girl,

06:37.331 --> 06:38.730
insulting her body,

06:38.732 --> 06:40.665
how she dresses,
her sexuality...

06:40.667 --> 06:42.401
Lack of sexuality.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.904
And the last time I checked,
as long as I delivered
you certain ratings,

06:45.906 --> 06:48.507
you didn't care what
sacred cows I went after.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.742
So why is she different?

06:54.181 --> 06:56.515
I named her, Leslie.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.651
I am doing everything I can
to cultivate a relationship

07:00.621 --> 07:02.854
between Supergirl
and catco.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.424
If I could legally adopt her,

07:05.626 --> 07:06.691
I would.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.028
I read your article, cat.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.497
You're just as hard on her
as I am.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.433
Supergirl is off the table.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.201
Effective immediately.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.105
What, you're dictating
my content now?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.373
Yes.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.877
Supergirl is changing
the conversation
of national city.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.547
People don't want your brand
of negativity anymore, Leslie.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.715
They want optimism,
hope, positivity.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.184
You're a hypocrite, cat.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.653
And you're finished, Leslie.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.156
I have two years
left on my contract.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.792
You are too proud,
and you're too cheap
to buy me out.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.527
That's true.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.563
However, I'm not firing you,

07:44.565 --> 07:47.232
I'm transferring you
to traffic chopper.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.502
You'll be national city's
highest paid traffic reporter.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.871
You do this,
you will regret it.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.406
Rush hour starts at 4:30.

07:54.408 --> 07:56.241
If you're not in the catcopter
when it goes up,

07:56.243 --> 07:57.876
you'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.312
(Gasps) Oh, and you
better take some dramamine,

08:00.314 --> 08:02.881
it looks like
it's going to be a bumpy ride.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.416
-(Thunder rumbles)
-(Scoffs)

08:09.823 --> 08:11.089
(Thunder cracking)

08:13.360 --> 08:16.027
Hi. Takeout for danvers.

08:22.135 --> 08:26.204
If the weather's
getting you down,
don't worry, it never lasts.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.740
Hey. No.
Actually, no, I miss it.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.175
It kind of reminds me
of the weather in Metropolis.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.880
Hey, if you're not going
home for the holiday,

08:34.882 --> 08:37.048
how about
friendsgiving at my place?

08:37.050 --> 08:38.917
That's so sweet.
Thank you, um...

08:38.919 --> 08:42.721
But Lucy and I are
actually headed to Ojai
for the holiday.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.755
The two of you?

08:44.625 --> 08:45.690
That's romantic.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.526
(Chuckles) Yeah.

08:47.828 --> 08:51.129
Uh, you know,
just decided to ditch
the families this year.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.298
But Ojai is only
a few hours away,

08:53.300 --> 08:57.035
so, if, uh,
if Supergirl needs anything,
just give me a call.

08:57.037 --> 09:01.273
Oh, honestly I'm more
worried about my family
this weekend.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.541
What do you mean?

09:02.543 --> 09:05.076
Alex is worried my foster
mom's going to chew her out

09:05.078 --> 09:07.979
because I came out
as Supergirl.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.714
-That makes zero sense.
-Right?

09:09.716 --> 09:12.384
And yet, it is
weekend for loved ones.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.819
Here's your loved one.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.489
-Have fun.
-Thanks, Kara.

09:17.491 --> 09:18.790
-Hey, Kara.
-Hey.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.258
Hey, babe.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.327
-You okay?
-Yeah.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.462
Yeah. I'm... just feeling
the weather, I guess.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.831
-Well, then, let's get you
out of the city.
-Okay.

09:26.833 --> 09:27.832
Let's go.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.236
Hey.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.904
Okay. I figured it out.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.173
Mom is furious
that you've come out,

09:35.175 --> 09:36.841
but she's pretending
that she isn't.

09:36.843 --> 09:37.842
Thank you.

09:39.580 --> 09:43.848
Have you considered that
Eliza really isn't mad?

09:44.718 --> 09:46.985
It's not like we're still kids
that she has to worry about.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.621
She has always
come down hard on me
for not protecting you.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.756
Then maybe it's time
for you to come out.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.858
Tell her who you really are.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.360
What you really do.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.461
Okay, wait.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.798
You want me to tell her
that I'm a deo agent?

10:00.634 --> 10:02.367
No way. I can't.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.803
Officially, we don't exist.

10:04.805 --> 10:08.006
Look, if she is mad at you

10:08.008 --> 10:10.775
'cause she thinks that
you're not looking after me,

10:10.777 --> 10:13.178
then tell her the truth.

10:13.647 --> 10:18.016
That your entire career,
everything you've
ever done in your life,

10:18.018 --> 10:19.985
it's all been to protect me.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.054
You've got to
give her a chance.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.892
Protecting you
isn't my actual job.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.629
Yeah, but you have
more fun when it is.

10:31.465 --> 10:32.564
(Thunder cracking)

10:32.566 --> 10:35.066
It's too much.
I'm taking her back in.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.568
The hell you are.

10:36.570 --> 10:40.138
Cat lady wants me
to cover traffic,
we're covering traffic.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.741
(Groans)

10:42.743 --> 10:43.742
(Alarm beeping)

10:46.146 --> 10:47.212
(Crowd exclaiming)

10:48.615 --> 10:49.748
Kara.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.915
Clear the sidewalk.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.218
Everybody, off the street!

10:53.220 --> 10:54.753
Clear the sidewalk.
Get inside.

11:00.694 --> 11:01.893
(Both screaming)

11:04.331 --> 11:05.397
(Screaming)

11:07.534 --> 11:09.100
No. No, no, no.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.771
-(Panting)
-(Siren blaring)

11:20.047 --> 11:21.513
(Music playing
over headphones)

11:24.818 --> 11:25.884
(Gasps)

11:27.487 --> 11:28.687
What the hell?

11:31.291 --> 11:32.457
You!

11:32.459 --> 11:33.458
Grab my hand.

11:33.794 --> 11:34.859
(Screaming)

11:48.842 --> 11:51.309
-I truly hate hospitals.
-(Monitor beeping)

11:51.712 --> 11:54.546
How much longer until it's
appropriate for us to leave?

11:54.548 --> 11:56.781
-You don't really mean that.
-Oh, I do.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.483
I am intensely germ-phobic.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.654
And I'm not crazy about
Leslie's new do.
It's very Katy Perry.

12:02.656 --> 12:03.955
If you didn't care
about Leslie,

12:03.957 --> 12:05.924
you wouldn't be paying
for this hospital room.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.560
Does she have any family?

12:08.762 --> 12:10.428
Not that she's mentioned.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.431
-Well, then,
who were those from?
-Her fans.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.468
Apparently, there's a whole
shrine in front of catco.

12:16.470 --> 12:19.604
I'm certain I'm going to
have to step over it
when I go in.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.673
(Sighs) Supergirl
must feel awful.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.475
Why?

12:23.710 --> 12:25.009
She saved the pilot,

12:25.212 --> 12:28.012
she prevented the catcopter
from crashing into the ground,

12:28.014 --> 12:29.814
and Leslie is still alive.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.350
I put her in that helicopter.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.019
If anybody should feel guilty,
it's me.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.955
Not that I do.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.358
Okay, that's long enough.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.827
We've paid our respects,
and I have a company to run.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.362
After you.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.372
Get up off your ass, Willis.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.375
You and I both know
that you're tougher
than a bolt of lightning.

12:58.612 --> 12:59.677
Come on.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.894
<i> Now for the latest</i>
<i> on Leslie Willis,</i>

13:15.896 --> 13:18.463
<i> the shock-jock national city</i>
<i> loves to hate.</i>

13:18.465 --> 13:21.633
<i>Willis is currently in a coma</i>
<i>at national city general,</i>

13:21.635 --> 13:23.568
<i> although her fate</i>
<i> would have been</i>
<i> much more grim</i>

13:23.570 --> 13:25.403
<i> had it not been</i>
<i> for the timely arrival</i>

13:25.405 --> 13:26.805
<i> of Supergirl...</i>

13:26.807 --> 13:28.072
Turn it off.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.340
I'm watching it.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.178
I knew it.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.580
You are mad.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.082
Well, go ahead and say it.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.886
I don't understand
how you could allow this.

13:41.888 --> 13:44.055
Let your sister
put on that cape.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.225
She has done amazing things.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.494
I know that
and I am very proud of her,

13:49.496 --> 13:51.429
but she's also
put herself in danger.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.730
She's an adult.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.900
She's going to do things
that you don't like.

13:55.902 --> 13:57.335
That is not my fault.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.104
She's been here 12 years,
and still thinks deep down

14:00.106 --> 14:01.940
everyone is as good as she is.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.675
You know better.
You should have stopped her.

14:03.677 --> 14:04.776
(Sighing) I...

14:04.778 --> 14:07.712
I thought
I could count on you
to watch out for her.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.514
I do know better about people.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.049
I wish I didn't.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.750
You know... no, I...

14:13.820 --> 14:16.254
I just remembered
I have something
to do at work.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.966
Girls are sleeping.

14:28.635 --> 14:29.701
Huh.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.536
Who'd have thought?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.037
Two teenage girls
sharing a room,

14:33.039 --> 14:34.272
and no one's dead yet.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.273
(Both chuckle)

14:35.575 --> 14:38.276
Stars aren't going anywhere,
Dr. danvers.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.146
Come keep me
company while I work
on my dissertation.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.982
Happily.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.483
Dr. danvers.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.495
Wait. Kara.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.630
It'll be fine.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.299
I don't think
this is a good idea.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.102
You're not supposed to, Kara.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.503
Come on, Alex.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.306
It'll be so much fun.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.787
This is amazing!

15:22.789 --> 15:24.022
I know, right?

15:24.524 --> 15:26.024
Let's see how
close we can get.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.033
(Panting)

15:38.939 --> 15:40.004
(Exhales)

15:43.543 --> 15:44.609
(Gasps)

15:45.312 --> 15:46.611
(Exhales)

15:47.147 --> 15:48.379
What is this?

15:49.482 --> 15:50.815
What...

15:50.817 --> 15:52.650
Man: Looks like
it's my lucky night.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.320
Halloween was last month,

15:55.989 --> 15:59.857
but with a body like that,
all I can say is,

15:59.859 --> 16:00.959
happy Turkey day to me!

16:01.428 --> 16:02.860
Back off, loser.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.562
Oh. (Chuckles)

16:05.398 --> 16:07.332
-We can have some fun...
-Keep away from me!

16:08.301 --> 16:09.734
Oh.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.670
Oh.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.175
Nice rush.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.260
Kara, your oven's
not the best.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.830
Would you mind giving it
a quick five seconds or so?

16:38.832 --> 16:39.864
Mmm.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.269
She comes in handy.

16:45.271 --> 16:48.072
I have to admit,
the first time she did it
I was a little worried.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.375
What if we were all eating
radioactive Turkey?

16:50.377 --> 16:51.609
(All laughing)

16:51.611 --> 16:53.511
It's no worse
than the microwave.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.512
We'll all live.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.217
You're having
a lot of fun, Alex.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.918
Let's get some food in you.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.453
Yeah. Everything looks great.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.621
Oh, especially the pie.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.191
Oh, yes. That is the
best pie in the galaxy.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.893
Or so I'm told.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.428
So, before we eat,

17:10.430 --> 17:13.965
I thought it would be nice
if we went around

17:13.967 --> 17:16.634
and shared
what we were grateful for,

17:16.636 --> 17:22.473
or any other feelings
that we might want to share
with family and friends,

17:22.909 --> 17:24.475
so let's share.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.913
Okay, I'll go first, um...

17:29.883 --> 17:31.749
I'm grateful
for everyone here.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.485
My best friend
in the entire world,

17:34.487 --> 17:37.221
my sister
who's always had my back,

17:37.924 --> 17:41.492
and the woman who always
treated me like a daughter.

17:41.761 --> 17:42.894
Thank you, sweetie.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.730
Alex, do you wanna go next?

17:45.732 --> 17:46.731
Nope.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.167
Winn, why don't you go?

17:49.169 --> 17:50.935
Yeah. Well, that's easy.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.070
-(Cell phone ringing)
-(Chuckles)

17:52.072 --> 17:53.104
Oh, sorry guys,
I'll turn it off.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.673
Oh, it's James.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.242
Um, sorry, sorry.
I'll make it quick.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.814
Thanksgiving call?
That's nice.

18:04.451 --> 18:08.419
That's really very thoughtful.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.621
James, hey. Everything okay?

18:11.124 --> 18:12.857
Was about to ask you
the same question.

18:12.859 --> 18:16.260
Well, Supergirl helped put
Leslie Willis into a coma,

18:16.262 --> 18:18.296
but other than that
there are no emergencies.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.098
I wasn't calling
about Supergirl.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.833
<i> -You weren't?</i>
-Nope.

18:21.835 --> 18:22.934
Calling my friend Kara.

18:22.936 --> 18:26.270
<i>She has to referee between</i>
<i>her sister and her foster mom.</i>

18:26.473 --> 18:29.807
So, thought maybe you'd
like to hear a friendly voice.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.043
Yours? Always. (Chuckles)

18:32.479 --> 18:33.544
How are you?

18:33.813 --> 18:36.214
Oh, you know, pampered.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.816
Stuffed.
A little bored. (Chuckles)

18:38.818 --> 18:41.185
Oh, I'm sorry there are
no super villains in Ojai.

18:41.187 --> 18:42.386
(Chuckles) Yeah.

18:42.388 --> 18:43.488
A guy can hope, right?

18:45.391 --> 18:49.827
Listen, well, if any show up
in national city
and uh, you need me,

18:49.829 --> 18:51.229
give me a call.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.630
<i> Thanks.</i>

18:54.100 --> 18:56.534
Have a wonderful time
with Lucy.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.970
Happy Thanksgiving, Kara.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.577
So, uh, Eliza,
you are a scientist?

19:06.579 --> 19:07.912
That's cool.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.881
A scientist is
a general term, dear.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.482
I am a bio-engineer.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.818
Alex is in the same field.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.053
You know, I guess
being a lab rat,
it runs in the family.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.422
There's something
I have to tell you.

19:18.424 --> 19:19.657
Eliza: Okay.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.725
Is everything all right?

19:20.727 --> 19:24.595
When I was at Stanford,
I was doing research
in genetic engineering.

19:24.597 --> 19:28.432
And my work
and connection to Kara,

19:28.434 --> 19:30.368
it came under scrutiny.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.104
And I was recruited
by the government.

19:34.107 --> 19:35.606
I'm not just a doctor.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.277
I'm an operative for an
organization called the deo.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.282
We monitor alien life
here on earth.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.585
I work in the field with Kara.

19:47.587 --> 19:51.355
I mean, that is my job,
mom, I look out for her.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.457
I would be happy
to carve this, Eliza.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.126
Are you out of your mind?

19:55.128 --> 19:56.627
Oh, here we go.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.197
-Who wants green beans? Uh...
-How could you
do this, Alexandra?

19:59.399 --> 20:01.866
She called her "Alexandra."
This is gonna get ugly.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.135
How could I do what?

20:04.137 --> 20:07.805
Devote my entire life
to watching over Kara?

20:07.807 --> 20:10.441
Well, I don't know, maybe
it's because it's what
you've told me to do

20:10.443 --> 20:12.310
since I was 14 years old.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.378
You lied to me for years.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.546
Is that what you got

20:15.548 --> 20:16.814
from all of that?

20:17.183 --> 20:21.219
So, Kara risks her life
to protect other people,

20:21.221 --> 20:22.286
and she is a hero.

20:23.089 --> 20:27.158
And yet, I do the same,
and I'm in trouble?

20:27.594 --> 20:29.660
That... is perfect.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.129
You think your father
would be proud of this?

20:32.131 --> 20:33.831
I will never win with you.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.735
-(Door slams)
-Oh.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.803
Yeah, I should go.

20:38.805 --> 20:39.904
Hey, thanks.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.072
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

20:49.415 --> 20:52.083
I don't understand
why you would react like that.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.417
No, Kara, you don't.

20:53.419 --> 20:57.188
She said you got mad at her
for my decision to tell
the world who I am.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.523
It's not her fault

20:59.525 --> 21:01.692
that I decided
to become Supergirl.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.794
That was my choice.

21:03.796 --> 21:04.962
I know.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.299
You were always so much
harder on her than me.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.333
Why?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.102
(Message tone beeps)

21:12.038 --> 21:13.204
(Sighs)

21:13.206 --> 21:15.039
Ms. Grant has an emergency
at the office.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.207
I'm gonna go handle it.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.853
You both are
in so much trouble.

21:32.225 --> 21:33.891
Do you have any idea
how lucky you are?

21:33.893 --> 21:35.793
Anyone could have seen you.

21:36.162 --> 21:38.496
Kara, the rules about
using your powers

21:38.498 --> 21:40.031
are for your protection.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.402
I'm so disappointed
in you, Alex.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.904
It wasn't her idea.
I made her do it.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.239
That's not the point, Kara.

21:48.241 --> 21:50.474
You're new to earth,
you're still learning.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.643
But you're her big sister now.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.579
It's your job to make sure
she doesn't put
herself in danger.

21:55.581 --> 21:56.747
(Banging on door)

21:59.485 --> 22:00.818
I'm sorry, mom.

22:02.288 --> 22:03.654
Girls, go upstairs.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.222
Now!

22:07.093 --> 22:09.260
Kara, don't you dare
use your super-hearing.

22:09.262 --> 22:10.928
-Alex!
-She won't, mom.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.101
Dr. danvers,

22:17.103 --> 22:19.337
I'd like to speak
with you and your husband.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.441
What's the emergency?

22:23.443 --> 22:26.177
Last minute conference call
to London and Beijing

22:26.179 --> 22:27.511
and nothing is working.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.413
Not my computer, not my phone,

22:29.415 --> 22:30.614
not my backup phone.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.352
I got that text off to you
and then, boom!

22:34.354 --> 22:35.753
Everything just died.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.922
Maybe that's a sign
you shouldn't work
on Thanksgiving.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.624
I always work
on thanksgivings,
thank you very much.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.293
I know it probably
seems sad to you,

22:42.295 --> 22:43.461
but I love it.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.464
Carter is with his dad,

22:46.466 --> 22:48.466
my mother won't eat
a flightless bird,

22:48.468 --> 22:51.435
and I am not pulled
in 400 different directions

22:51.437 --> 22:53.604
by employees who need
constant wet-nursing.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.473
I think we need winn's help.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.807
What's a "winn"?

22:58.077 --> 23:00.311
He's... he's the it guy.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.380
Sits right across from me.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.983
(Huffs)

23:06.352 --> 23:08.753
What fresh incompetence
is this?

23:08.921 --> 23:11.589
Leslie: <i> Gobble, gobble.</i>
<i> Miss... miss me?</i>

23:11.758 --> 23:12.890
Leslie?

23:13.593 --> 23:14.892
(Static)

23:14.894 --> 23:15.993
<i> No.</i>

23:15.995 --> 23:17.995
<i> Leslie Willis is dead.</i>

23:18.431 --> 23:20.331
<i> D-e-a-d. Dead.</i>

23:21.234 --> 23:23.501
<i> She died in that</i>
<i> catcopter of yours.</i>

23:25.004 --> 23:27.505
<i> This is Leslie 2.0.</i>

23:29.442 --> 23:30.741
<i> Livewire.</i>

23:31.577 --> 23:33.310
<i> And you and I...</i>

23:34.614 --> 23:36.180
<i> We're gonna have words.</i>

23:36.182 --> 23:37.681
My god, Leslie.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.190
(Grunts)

23:48.561 --> 23:49.760
(Whispering)
Get down, get down.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.029
(Whispering)
She was in a coma.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.165
Yeah. Clearly,
she's recovered.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.434
Ms. Grant,
we have to get help.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.968
Yes. Yes. Security.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.703
Security is 20 floors down.

23:59.705 --> 24:01.305
Go, go. I'll keep her busy.

24:01.307 --> 24:03.874
-But...
-No, 20 floors down.

24:03.876 --> 24:04.975
Go, go.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.851
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.411
What happened to you, Leslie?

24:40.413 --> 24:41.912
I've transcended.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.048
Do you really care how or why?

24:44.050 --> 24:45.149
Not particularly.

24:46.586 --> 24:47.718
(Both grunting)

24:51.357 --> 24:52.990
You don't have to do this.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.259
-Let me help you.
-(Scoffs)

24:55.261 --> 24:56.694
I'm good as is.

25:03.369 --> 25:05.369
You need to
get out of here. Go!

25:05.371 --> 25:07.071
-Oh, crap.
-Livewire: Thanks.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.874
I was feeling
a little depleted.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.013
(Groans)

25:27.493 --> 25:28.626
Oh, god.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.294
Livewire: <i> Oh, Supergirl...</i>

25:30.296 --> 25:32.463
<i> Poor cat's stock</i>
<i> is plummeting.</i>

25:32.465 --> 25:33.697
(Evil laughter)

25:37.036 --> 25:38.736
Oh, god, oh, god...

25:46.846 --> 25:48.045
(Metal creaking)

25:50.816 --> 25:52.283
You're safe now, Ms. Grant.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.151
Oh, thank you.

25:59.525 --> 26:02.893
Newsreader: <i> ...Many families</i>
<i>in national city are</i>
<i>celebrating this Thanksgiving</i>

26:02.895 --> 26:04.328
<i> without electricity,</i>

26:04.330 --> 26:07.464
<i> as a series of</i>
<i> inexplicable blackouts</i>
<i> cripple the city,</i>

26:07.466 --> 26:11.001
<i> leaving people without power</i>
<i> and with a growing</i>
<i> sense of fear.</i>

26:11.003 --> 26:12.903
Are you sure
this was Leslie Willis?

26:12.905 --> 26:14.838
She calls herself
livewire now.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.007
But how did this
happen to her?

26:17.009 --> 26:18.676
Just because she was
hit by lightning?

26:19.078 --> 26:20.678
She didn't get hit
by lightning.

26:21.681 --> 26:22.846
You did.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.416
You're element x.

26:25.418 --> 26:30.354
Normal electrostatic discharge
intensified as it passed
through your Kryptonian DNA,

26:30.356 --> 26:31.789
picking up unknown properties.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.357
That's what's created her.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.492
So it's my fault
she's this way?

26:35.494 --> 26:37.628
Talk to me about her powers.
She siphons off energy?

26:37.630 --> 26:39.463
She sucked up
my heat-vision.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.365
It's like she is energy.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.000
She becomes energy.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.469
But when she's not energy,
she has a physical form
you can punch?

26:45.705 --> 26:47.705
-Yes.
-Then we can fight her,
Ms. danvers.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.373
-How?
-Cat: Excuse me?

26:49.809 --> 26:53.210
Agent mulder, is it?

26:53.546 --> 26:55.045
Munroe, Ms. Grant.

26:55.047 --> 26:58.315
Well, your agents are
destroying my building
more than Leslie did.

26:58.317 --> 27:02.052
I'm assuming the FBI
is going to reimburse me for
all the damage they're doing?

27:02.054 --> 27:04.555
We wouldn't be doing
any damage if you'd
allowed us to relocate you

27:04.557 --> 27:05.723
to a secure location.

27:05.725 --> 27:09.059
I didn't get where I am
by running and hiding
from a fight.

27:09.462 --> 27:12.997
Tomorrow is black Friday,
and catco will be
open for business.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.402
Let's go, guys.

27:18.404 --> 27:19.570
I'll see you out.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.972
I have something
at the deo that may help.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.074
One of our prisoners
is a zarolatt.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.743
Is that like, um...

27:25.978 --> 27:27.144
Those...

27:27.146 --> 27:28.679
Zarolatt is an
interdimensional race
of aliens

27:28.681 --> 27:30.514
consisting of pure,
sentient energy.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.749
Yeah. I was gonna say that.

27:31.751 --> 27:34.184
Maybe I could modify the trap
we used on it for livewire.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.352
Can I help?

27:35.354 --> 27:37.054
Cat: Kara.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.823
Sounds like you got
your hands full here.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.528
Do you need something,
Ms. Grant?

27:44.530 --> 27:45.929
(Exhales) Yes.

27:46.599 --> 27:47.765
My life back.

27:48.367 --> 27:51.101
Barring that,
there's no reason
for you to stay here.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.537
No reason for us both
to be miserable.

27:53.539 --> 27:54.605
No, I don't mind.

27:54.607 --> 27:56.407
And I don't really feel
comfortable leaving you

27:56.409 --> 27:58.108
here alone with livewire
on the loose.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.343
You?

27:59.345 --> 28:00.678
You're useless.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.713
And I'm sure you're eager
to get back to your family.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.515
Not particularly.

28:04.517 --> 28:05.549
Uh...

28:05.551 --> 28:10.287
Me and my sister
and my foster mom got in
a really big fight earlier.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.358
You have a foster mother?
That's mildly intriguing.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.727
Yeah. Uh, well...

28:17.229 --> 28:22.800
Um... my parents
passed away when I
was thirteen, in, um, a fire.

28:22.802 --> 28:23.967
Oh...

28:25.905 --> 28:27.037
I'm...

28:27.707 --> 28:28.939
I'm sorry.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.207
Uh, no. It's fine.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.310
I mean, it hurts.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.580
But I still feel
close with them.

28:37.149 --> 28:41.418
And my foster mom, Eliza,
she's great with me.
It's just her and Alex...

28:41.987 --> 28:46.290
Well, mothers and daughters,
it's... hard.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.960
Yours must be so proud of you.

28:50.329 --> 28:53.797
(Chuckles) Well,
if she is, it's on
some subterranean level.

28:54.867 --> 28:58.736
In her mind,
I have never lived up
to my potential.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.305
You're the queen of all media.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.840
Ah! Yes.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.343
An accomplishment
that never mattered to her.

29:06.345 --> 29:10.180
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I am entirely grateful.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.783
Everything I am,
everything I have,

29:12.785 --> 29:16.754
is because of
her constant "pushing,"
let's call it.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.990
She was never
satisfied with me,

29:19.992 --> 29:22.593
and so I've never
satisfied with myself.

29:23.295 --> 29:27.364
Which is why
I keep pushing, too.

29:27.366 --> 29:29.666
Myself, and all the people
I care about.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.535
Pushing Supergirl.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.104
I should have pushed Leslie.

29:34.607 --> 29:36.373
Held her to a higher standard.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.709
The more awful she was,
the more I rewarded her.

29:40.045 --> 29:43.380
Leslie turning into livewire,
that started a long time ago.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.684
It's my fault.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.954
I turned her into a monster.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.658
I need to fix this.
I need to talk to Supergirl.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.060
Surely the FBI has
a direct line to her.

29:57.062 --> 29:58.695
I'll ask him. I'll ask him.

29:58.697 --> 30:01.165
Uh, and also, um...

30:02.301 --> 30:04.334
I think I will go home.

30:04.336 --> 30:05.569
Mmm-hmm.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.140
(Soft music playing)

30:12.945 --> 30:14.011
(Door opens)

30:19.318 --> 30:22.352
Uh, there are blackouts
all over the city,

30:22.354 --> 30:25.255
so I just wanted to
make sure that you were okay.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.857
Eliza: A blackout
I can handle.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.092
-You, on the other hand...
-Mom.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.395
Please.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.031
I can't fight
anymore tonight.

30:34.667 --> 30:35.933
(Sighs)

30:36.302 --> 30:38.735
Please come... come here.

30:38.737 --> 30:40.270
Sit for just a minute.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.453
I'm so sorry for what I said
about your dad.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.455
That wasn't fair.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.290
You always make
the hard choice.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.127
You look to help others
before yourself.

31:04.129 --> 31:05.762
That's what you
taught me to do.

31:08.234 --> 31:13.136
(Sobbing) So why hasn't it
ever been enough?

31:14.740 --> 31:16.306
If you're...

31:16.308 --> 31:18.408
If you mean
why I was tough on you...

31:18.911 --> 31:20.043
(Sighs)

31:20.045 --> 31:22.646
Kara was a little girl
from another planet.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.648
She lost everything.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.585
I didn't know how
to do anything
but accept her.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.155
You, you're my daughter, Alex.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.726
I wanted you to be
better than me.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.162
But that never meant
I didn't love you.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.600
You have always been
my Supergirl.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.673
(Sniffling)

31:51.277 --> 31:52.976
(Stammering) I'm sorry too.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.513
For keeping things from you.

32:02.288 --> 32:03.854
There is something
I need to tell you.

32:03.856 --> 32:05.656
I need to tell both of you.

32:05.658 --> 32:07.257
(Cell phone vibrating)

32:11.297 --> 32:12.362
Danvers.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.199
Twenty minutes.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.468
Uh, I have to go in.

32:18.804 --> 32:19.870
Uh...

32:20.806 --> 32:21.872
Is it about Kara?

32:22.975 --> 32:24.875
I can't talk about it.

32:24.877 --> 32:27.177
-I'm sorry.
-Take care of your sister.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.781
Take care of yourself.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.717
I will.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.564
(Wind whooshing)

32:48.300 --> 32:49.566
Hello, Ms. Grant.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.737
You know, if you would
just give me your
cell phone number,

32:53.739 --> 32:56.139
I wouldn't have to do
so much back-channeling.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.976
Now, you want
to catch livewire,

32:58.978 --> 33:00.344
so do I.

33:00.846 --> 33:04.381
I can draw her out,
but then we'll have
to work together.

33:04.383 --> 33:05.716
What do you say?

33:06.452 --> 33:07.517
Partners?

33:13.692 --> 33:15.525
-(Whirring)
-Hank: Lightning in a bottle.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.895
Or, technically,
lightning in a portable
industrial capacitor.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.864
Get it underneath her,
spring it open
and close it.

33:20.866 --> 33:22.733
The electricity
running through will be
drawn inside.

33:22.735 --> 33:24.901
She'll be temporarily
broken down
on the atomic level,

33:24.903 --> 33:27.004
at least until
we can get her into
permanent containment.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.939
Cool, it's like <i> ghostbusters.</i>

33:30.009 --> 33:31.208
Sounds like a plan.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.442
You gonna tell us
where you're going?

33:32.444 --> 33:34.611
This is between me,
Ms. Grant and livewire.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.446
Based on the amount
of power she's consumed,

33:36.448 --> 33:39.783
there is a very real chance
that she's gonna be
strong enough...

33:39.785 --> 33:41.351
-She can hurt me. I know.
-Kara.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.086
She can kill you.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.789
I'll see you soon.

33:46.291 --> 33:47.357
(Whirring)

33:48.627 --> 33:50.794
Citizens of national city,
this is cat Grant,

33:50.796 --> 33:53.897
broadcasting live from
catco Plaza,

33:53.899 --> 33:56.233
which despite
a vicious attack yesterday,

33:56.235 --> 33:58.101
is still open
for business.

33:58.103 --> 34:01.571
This message is for
the person behind
that attack.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.607
Leslie, if you are
hearing this,

34:03.609 --> 34:06.109
your grudge is with me,
not national city,

34:06.111 --> 34:09.646
so let's not see if we can't
come to an agreement.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.882
Let's meet...

34:12.651 --> 34:15.886
Where it all began,
as they say.

34:15.888 --> 34:20.257
I'm not one to look back,
but it just feels right
this time.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.506
Come on, Leslie.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.680
Where's your bodyguard?

34:43.682 --> 34:45.849
I didn't think
she was necessary.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.017
Oh, sucks.

34:47.019 --> 34:50.187
I really wanted one of you
to watch the other one die.

34:50.189 --> 34:51.855
Oh, Leslie,
you and I got through

34:51.857 --> 34:54.257
you not supporting
Hillary in 2008,

34:54.259 --> 34:55.358
we can get through this.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.095
Just give me your terms.

34:58.097 --> 35:01.531
The only thing that you have
that I want is your skin.

35:01.967 --> 35:05.368
And there are so
many ways to skin a...

35:05.370 --> 35:06.603
A cat, yes.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.306
Congratulations,
you have the wit
of a Youtube comment.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.374
Are we going to talk or not?

35:11.376 --> 35:12.476
Not.

35:17.616 --> 35:18.949
Leslie!

35:21.086 --> 35:23.386
Your 15 minutes are up,

35:23.388 --> 35:25.555
you boring, weak...

35:25.991 --> 35:28.325
Oh, shut up, you mean girl.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.495
(Shattering)

35:34.066 --> 35:35.665
(Grunting)

35:50.649 --> 35:51.915
(Groans)

36:03.262 --> 36:04.327
(Grunts)

36:13.872 --> 36:15.205
Nice try.

36:15.874 --> 36:16.940
(Groans)

36:16.942 --> 36:20.510
I wonder if I have enough
power to stop your heart.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.511
Cat: Leslie!

36:21.880 --> 36:23.246
Leslie, don't do this!

36:23.615 --> 36:24.948
(Supergirl grunting)

36:27.819 --> 36:29.085
(Water running)

36:31.056 --> 36:32.789
You're better than this.

36:34.193 --> 36:36.193
You are Leslie Willis.

36:36.662 --> 36:40.230
If it makes you feel better
I'll always give you credit
for giving me my start.

36:40.232 --> 36:41.565
And finishing you off.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.866
(Grunts)

36:55.747 --> 36:58.815
Water and electricity,
never a good match.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.118
Thanks for your help.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.054
Oh, you're welcome, Supergirl.

37:16.068 --> 37:18.501
Okay. Turkey, stuffing,
cranberry sauce,

37:18.503 --> 37:21.338
sweet potato,
and three slices of pie.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.608
Payment in full for putting
up with my crazy family.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.843
Thanks.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.478
(Both laugh)

37:28.480 --> 37:29.479
Oh, yeah.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.152
Hey, um...

37:35.153 --> 37:37.020
(Stammers) So,
I didn't get to tell you
what I was thankful for.

37:37.022 --> 37:39.422
Well, you were in
the middle of a war zone.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.790
My dad's in prison.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.361
-Winn, I'm so sorry.
-Don't be sorry.

37:44.363 --> 37:47.364
He's a pretty bad person
and he deserves to be there.

37:48.033 --> 37:51.868
Uh, anyways, so my family
doesn't really do holidays.

37:52.137 --> 37:55.038
So, I mean, even with
all the nuttiness of yours,

37:55.540 --> 37:58.041
I'm just grateful to have
been included.

37:59.444 --> 38:03.446
(Stammers)
What I'm grateful for is you.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.148
(Chuckles)

38:09.788 --> 38:10.854
You too.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.224
Oh. Hey, guys,

38:14.226 --> 38:15.892
how was wine country?

38:15.894 --> 38:16.993
It was really great.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.062
Four days with James
all to myself.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.463
All a girl could ask for.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.065
(All laughing)

38:22.267 --> 38:24.000
Back to the grind.

38:24.002 --> 38:25.302
-Bye, babe. I'll see you.
-Bye.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.470
-Bye, Kara.
-Bye.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.006
You okay?

38:30.008 --> 38:31.574
-I saw that livewire...
-Yeah.

38:31.576 --> 38:33.076
Uh, Supergirl handled it.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.078
Of course.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.680
But how about Kara?

38:36.682 --> 38:37.881
How's she doing?

38:38.950 --> 38:40.483
Glad to have you back.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.892
The photo department's
been calling.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.095
About the paparazzi shots
from over the weekend

38:52.097 --> 38:54.431
of the young stars
and starlets,

38:54.433 --> 38:57.867
compromised in assorted
humiliating ways.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.269
Monday morning tradition.

39:00.272 --> 39:01.871
Mmm-hmm.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.540
Which one would you pick?

39:03.542 --> 39:06.776
The 20-year-old singer
who face-planted in front of
club apocalypse

39:06.778 --> 39:09.179
because she
had too much to drink?

39:09.181 --> 39:12.716
Or the closeted
teen heartthrob

39:12.718 --> 39:16.619
who was caught slipping out
of national city's
randiest gay bar?

39:16.888 --> 39:19.289
-Wait, who's...
-Let's run...

39:19.291 --> 39:20.423
Mmm.

39:20.425 --> 39:21.424
Neither.

39:23.995 --> 39:26.963
The world is full of
so much noise and snark,

39:26.965 --> 39:28.865
much of it we generate.

39:28.867 --> 39:33.436
Today, why don't we
elevate this city's level of
discourse instead

39:33.438 --> 39:36.306
with a photo essay
of all the people
who spent their holidays

39:36.308 --> 39:39.275
volunteering at soup kitchens
and shelters.

39:39.277 --> 39:43.146
Let's not see if we
can't bring some attention
to those organizations.

39:43.415 --> 39:45.982
I think that's a great idea.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.218
Well, of course you do,
I pitched it.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.753
Thanksgiving sells.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.055
Liberals love to feel guilty,

39:52.057 --> 39:55.125
so let's just squeeze
as much juice out of those
turkeys as we can.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.461
And Kara...

40:01.166 --> 40:05.468
What you told me
about your parents dying...

40:08.673 --> 40:10.940
There's a lot
I don't know about you.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.077
And that should
probably change.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.812
It's fine, Ms. Grant.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.982
You know enough
about me to know that
I need my three "l's,"

40:18.984 --> 40:23.453
my latte hot,
my lettuce-wrapped crisp
and my Lexapro, stat.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.289
And not necessarily
in that order. Chop, chop.

40:29.394 --> 40:30.693
(Sighs)

40:30.695 --> 40:31.694
(Chuckles)

40:37.903 --> 40:40.603
Even I am finding
this grip impressive.

40:42.374 --> 40:43.973
I am so proud of you.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.208
Thank you.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.444
Oh, guys, this is so nice.

40:47.446 --> 40:50.113
I'm proud of you
too, Supergirl,

40:50.115 --> 40:53.016
but from what I see
on the news,
there is room for improvement.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.217
Wow!

40:54.219 --> 40:57.220
That was not an unqualified
compliment, which...

40:57.556 --> 41:00.690
Is progress for us,
but not fun for me.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.892
Well, this is the best day
of my life. (Chuckles)

41:02.894 --> 41:05.462
I haven't been fair.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.831
I have put a lot
on both of you.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.999
But there is something
I need to tell you.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.068
Something I promised
your father I wouldn't,

41:12.070 --> 41:14.704
but if you're gonna be
working for the deo
you need to know.

41:15.440 --> 41:19.042
Your dad wasn't just
a doctor either

41:19.044 --> 41:21.244
and he did not die
in a plane crash.

41:21.246 --> 41:24.414
That is what they told me,
but I don't trust them.

41:24.416 --> 41:25.748
Mom, what are you
talking about?

41:26.952 --> 41:29.686
I've known about
the deo for a long time.

41:30.021 --> 41:31.554
I know what they do.

41:33.358 --> 41:35.258
Eliza: No, you are
not taking her.

41:35.260 --> 41:38.661
Due respect, Dr. danvers,
you are in no position
to negotiate.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.830
She is not an asset.
She is a 13-year-old girl.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.266
-She needs a family.
She needs...
-To be safe.

41:43.768 --> 41:45.401
As do those around her.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.570
And while Superman refuses
to work with our study,

41:47.572 --> 41:49.405
Kara would help immensely.

41:49.407 --> 41:50.773
You're not gonna touch her.

41:52.277 --> 41:54.277
I'm gonna give you something
you want even more.

41:54.279 --> 41:55.612
(Scoffs) Oh, yeah?
What's that?

41:56.314 --> 41:57.580
Me.

41:57.883 --> 41:59.616
Eliza: Jeremiah...

42:00.886 --> 42:02.285
I'll work for you.

42:04.055 --> 42:07.290
I know everything
there is to know
about Superman.

42:08.059 --> 42:11.294
My research, my work,
it's all yours.

42:12.497 --> 42:14.931
But Kara stays here.

42:16.568 --> 42:19.102
Welcome to the deo,
Dr. danvers.

42:26.244 --> 42:28.878
Jeremiah died working
for the deo.

42:30.348 --> 42:33.650
He died working for a man
named Hank henshaw.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.395
Good job
with livewire, Supergirl.

42:45.397 --> 42:48.264
The deo has its first
non-alien prisoner.

42:49.234 --> 42:51.000
And now the holidays are over
and you've had your fun,

42:51.002 --> 42:53.269
perhaps you can get back
to your actual job.

42:53.271 --> 42:54.470
Catching aliens.

42:54.472 --> 42:55.805
Yes, sir.

42:56.241 --> 42:57.507
That's it? No comeback?

42:57.509 --> 42:59.676
No, sir, just ready to work.

43:01.947 --> 43:03.079
All right.

43:06.284 --> 43:08.518
We have to find out
what happened to my dad.

43:08.520 --> 43:09.852
Absolutely.
