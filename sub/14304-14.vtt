( school bell rings )

02:07.661 --> 02:10.662
Thanks for agreeing
to go with me tonight, Star.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.065
Dances make me
a little anxious.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.833
What are you
so worried about?

02:14.835 --> 02:18.270
Well, I had a nightmare
that I came to the dance alone,

02:18.272 --> 02:20.806
and everyone laughed
and threw tomatoes at me.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.508
Then all my teeth fell out.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.077
Oh, and then Jackie saw me,
and said I looked pasty.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.079
That's not gonna happen.

02:27.081 --> 02:29.982
- It'll be fine.
- ( Marco yells )

02:29.984 --> 02:32.684
My leg. I can't
feel my leg!

02:32.686 --> 02:34.820
- That's my leg.
- Oh. Sorry.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.688
What happened?

02:36.690 --> 02:38.524
I just saw a huge rat
in the air duct.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.259
Yeah. This place
is a dump.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.793
Star, come here.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.196
Janna Banana!

02:44.198 --> 02:46.865
Did you get it,
did you get it?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.800
I made it.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.202
( gasping )

02:50.204 --> 02:52.037
Cake on a plate.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.673
It's time to find out
if the legend is true.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.675
Will Bon Bon come back?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.877
BOTH: Just like his candles?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.112
( laughter )

03:00.114 --> 03:02.047
This séance
is gonna be epic.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.483
I will see you
tonight at 7:00.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.718
I'll see you tonight
at... wait, what?

03:06.720 --> 03:10.689
Yeah, Bon Bon said he'd
be back on his 100th death day,

03:10.691 --> 03:12.491
and that's tonight.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.027
Oh, I thought it was
tomorrow.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.329
I promised Marco
I'd be his dance buddy tonight.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.964
His teeth might fall out
if he goes alone.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.899
What are you gonna
remember more,

03:20.901 --> 03:23.969
high school dance
or a dead clown séance?

03:23.971 --> 03:25.904
Dead clown séance.

03:25.906 --> 03:26.872
Marco!

03:26.874 --> 03:28.707
Okay, see you later.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.542

( squealing )

03:32.179 --> 03:34.313
Are you okay?

03:34.315 --> 03:38.150
Jackie Lynne Thomas
just asked me to the dance.

03:38.152 --> 03:40.886
And I said yes!

03:40.888 --> 03:43.522
Wait! But you and I,
we were gonna go together.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.257
No, no, Marco,
this is perfect.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.192
I totally forgot that
I promised Janna

03:47.194 --> 03:49.094
that I'd resurrect
a dead clown with her tonight.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.730
So you should totally,
totally go with Jackie.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.266
Really?
- Marco, clown séance.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.268
Yes! Yes!

03:56.270 --> 03:57.903
Yes!

03:59.739 --> 04:01.006

04:15.955 --> 04:18.257

04:21.629 --> 04:23.629
Five wipe, six wipe,

04:27.400 --> 04:29.134

04:31.739 --> 04:33.805
Whoa! Ugh!
What the heck?

04:33.807 --> 04:35.574
Watch where
you're going, Marco.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.576
Janna, what...
what are you doing here?

04:37.578 --> 04:40.145
We just need a few more
supplies for our séance tonight.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.748
Now my backside
smells like cologne.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.583
Hey!

04:44.585 --> 04:46.752
Ain't nothin'
wrong with that.

04:46.754 --> 04:47.986
It's nice.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.454
Yeah, it's nice.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.323
- Stop smelling me!

Dead clown séance?!

Now lead the way.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.337
I like your natural
headlamp, Glossaryck.

It's not natural,

Bon Bon's skull still
has the clown nose on it.

Oh, no way. Maggots
would've eaten it by now.

Maggots don't eat plastic.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.184
- Plastic?
- Yeah.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.720
Glossaryck, all clowns
have plastic noses.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.122
No. Real clowns
have meat noses.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.057
Ugh. What do you
think, Star?

07:06.059 --> 07:07.859
Don't you think it's weird

07:07.861 --> 07:09.594
that Marco asked me
to the dance,

07:09.596 --> 07:11.530
and then totally changed
his mind at the last minute?

07:11.532 --> 07:12.864
That's, like, not cool,
right?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.433
What?! No.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.035
You told Marco
you didn't wanna go,

07:17.037 --> 07:18.970
because you wanted
to see Bon Bon.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.772
You do wanna see
Bon Bon, don't you?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.741

07:29.982 --> 07:31.216
- Meat.
- Plastic.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.051
- Meat.
- Plastic.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.887
Janna, Glossaryck,
check it out.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.628
- "I will come back."
- BOTH: It's Bon Bon!

07:49.836 --> 07:52.504
Uh, so, I was just
gonna ask.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.073
What are your hobbies?

07:55.075 --> 07:58.143
Oh, uh,
lots of stuff, I guess.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.111
Skateboarding,
which you know.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.147
I'm kinda into
history books.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.249
I actually read
this really cool one about--

08:04.251 --> 08:06.952
Hm, interesting.
What kind of music do you like?

08:06.954 --> 08:10.288
Uh... I guess
pretty mellow stuff.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.023
I know that's
totally vague.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.658
Next question.
Do you like food?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.093
If so what kinds?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.461
Wait. Hold on.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.130
You just wiped something
on your face.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.665
- It's all...
- What?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.033
It's all blue now.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.502
- Here. Let me see that.
- No, no. No, no.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.806

08:30.209 --> 08:32.143
Okay.

08:32.145 --> 08:36.114
Okay, let's see
what's goin' on here.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.217
There's hot wings girl.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.653
Light bulb sisters.

08:41.655 --> 08:45.490
Ugh. Looks like somebody
forgot to cancel

08:45.492 --> 08:48.126

Greetings, kids.
A corsage for the lady?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.236
Thanks, but
we don't need one.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.205
But it's mandatory.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.240
Aw! It's crooked.

such a disappointment.

a mistake.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.148
Huh? What do you mean?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.517
I never should've
asked you to the dance.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.586
( sighs )
Yeah. No, yeah, yeah.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.888
I mean, you're right.
You're totally right.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.723
Why would you go
with me to a dance?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.058
I should've just
asked you on a date.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.593
Huh?

Do you wanna go

10:34.901 --> 10:37.235
- What is it?
- I don't know.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.770
It's, like, a spell.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.673
There's a little drawing
of a rat or something.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.342
Uh, we're kind of
in the middle of something.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.145
So I can do whatever I...

10:47.147 --> 10:48.546
Yeah, whatever. Go.

10:54.754 --> 10:57.656
Oh, whoops. I accidentally
deleted the picture.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.591
Problem solved?

10:59.593 --> 11:01.292
Can we just focus
on the shrine now?

11:01.294 --> 11:03.361
Yes. Shrine time.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.707
Okay, got that?
All right.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.276
- Now stir the cereal.
- Got it.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.279
Stir, stir, stir,
stir, stir, stir.

11:21.281 --> 11:25.316
And then, we add
one, just one,
malted milk ball.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.852
One for me,
one for you.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.387
Are you sure about this?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.356
Jackie, trust the chef.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.458
( laughs )
All right.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.362
( choking )

11:37.364 --> 11:39.364
Marco!
( coughing )

11:39.366 --> 11:41.800
It's terrible.
( retches )

11:41.802 --> 11:44.269
Really? It was good
the last time I had it.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.007
Ugh. ( sputters )

11:49.009 --> 11:51.576
( giggling )

11:51.578 --> 11:55.380
( tentative laughter )

11:55.382 --> 11:57.215
Your face.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.018
( both laughing )

12:00.020 --> 12:02.420
See, Marco?

12:02.422 --> 12:05.090
You're adorable
when you laugh at yourself.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.224
What?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.259
Relax, dude.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.662
I... I'm relaxed.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.964
( stammering )

12:24.043 --> 12:27.245
Seriously, why are you
so nervous?

12:27.247 --> 12:29.247
Uh, I don't know.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.049
'Cause it's a date,
and you're super cool,

12:31.051 --> 12:32.383
and I'm just
afraid of messing up.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.586
Marco, you already
messed up.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.688
- What?
- Yeah.

12:36.690 --> 12:39.624
You puked on my lap
in third grade.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.459
You broke my skateboard.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.428
And then there's
that weird box thing

12:43.430 --> 12:45.930
- you got trapped in
at Star's sleepover.
- Okay, okay.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.532
You sent me anonymous
text messages of cats.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.200
All right.
Point taken.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.368
Then there was
the little neck guy

12:50.370 --> 12:52.403
that came out of
your neck or whatever.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.439
Jackie, I don't wanna
relive that.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.908
Fair enough.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.276
But you know
what I like about you,

12:58.278 --> 13:01.112
is that even after
a humiliating, crushing defeat,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.414
you just pick yourself
right back up,

13:03.416 --> 13:06.284
and you hop right back on,
kinda like skateboarding.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.487
Yeah, well, I don't know
how to skateboard

13:09.489 --> 13:12.657
- What?
- No, I never...
What are you doing?

13:12.659 --> 13:16.161
Whoa! You just
keep that
down there?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.665
- Well?
- No, no, no, no.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.967
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.937
- Marco, you can do this.
- No, forget it.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.739
Marco, do it for me?

13:27.741 --> 13:30.275
Ugh. Okay.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.843
I'm gonna do this.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.278
Don't look down.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.946
Don't look up.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.347
( stammering )

13:38.851 --> 13:41.186
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah, I trust...

13:42.154 --> 13:43.688
Okay, I'm done.

13:43.690 --> 13:47.192
( snoring )

13:47.194 --> 13:49.594
Janna, wake up!

13:49.596 --> 13:51.329
No, you shut up.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.131
( groans )

13:53.133 --> 13:55.433
I might as well be
spending the night alone

13:55.435 --> 13:57.335
in a graveyard.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.172
If any dead clowns feel like
coming back from the dead

14:01.174 --> 14:03.675
I think now would be
a pretty good time.

14:06.378 --> 14:09.714
Ugh! Should've just gone
to that stupid dance.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.649
( beeps )

14:11.651 --> 14:13.818
Bet Marco's
having a good time.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.955
( dialing, line ringing )

14:16.957 --> 14:18.389
( buzzing )

14:18.391 --> 14:20.658
<i>Hey, it's Marco.</i>
<i>I'm not here right now,</i>

14:20.660 --> 14:22.360
<i>but leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll call you right back.</i>

14:22.362 --> 14:24.996
Hey, Marco,
it's just me,

14:24.998 --> 14:26.998
checkin' up on
my best bud.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.734
Drop me a line
when you get home.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.703
Just wanna
check up on you.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.404
If you want to.
If not, that's...

14:33.406 --> 14:35.807
that's cool, too.
Bye.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.477
- ( groans )
- ( dialing )

14:39.479 --> 14:41.579
<i>Hey, it's Marco.</i>
<i>I'm not here right now...</i>

14:41.581 --> 14:43.481
- ( groans )
- ( dialing )

14:43.483 --> 14:45.516
<i>Hey, it's Marco.</i>
<i>I'm not here right now,</i>

14:45.518 --> 14:47.719
<i>but leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll call you right back.</i>

14:47.721 --> 14:49.754
<i>Hey, it's Marco.</i>
<i>I'm not here right now,</i>

14:49.756 --> 14:51.389
<i>but leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll call you right back.</i>

14:51.391 --> 14:52.991
<i>Hey, it's Marco...</i>

14:52.993 --> 14:54.559
( frustrated groan )

14:54.561 --> 14:56.160
Why aren't you picking up?!

14:56.162 --> 14:57.996
( snoring )

15:04.904 --> 15:06.504
Glossaryck, wake up.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.540
Hey, what's the name
of that spying spell?

15:09.542 --> 15:11.609
( muttering )

15:11.611 --> 15:15.246
Oh. The all-seeing eye,
uh, you're talking about.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.016
- Where is it?
- That would be...

15:18.018 --> 15:19.350
that would be in
Eclypso's chapter.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.052
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.754
You don't wanna go there.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.024
Eclypso...

15:26.026 --> 15:29.527
Dark magic. Not nice
to spy on people.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.297
( laughs )
Glossaryck,
don't be ridiculous.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.465
I'm not using it
to spy on anyone.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.535
Spying leads to crying.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.237
( snoring )

15:39.239 --> 15:41.239
Well, I'm not spying.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.974
( snoring continues )

15:42.976 --> 15:45.376
Aha! Here it is.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.480
I summon
the all-seeing eye

15:49.482 --> 15:51.783
to tear a hole
into the sky.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.485
Reveal to me
that which is hidden.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.288
Unveil to me
what is forbidden.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.996
Whoa!

16:04.998 --> 16:07.932
Don't worry.
I've got you.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.567
Oh!

16:11.503 --> 16:14.005
( growls )

16:17.509 --> 16:18.743
What?!

16:20.679 --> 16:22.146
( yells )

16:22.148 --> 16:23.581
What'd I miss?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.683
- Did I do that?
- Yes, you fell on me.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.485
I know I fell on you.
I was there for that.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.287
There was this eyeball spell,
and Jackie and Marco--

16:29.289 --> 16:32.290
Slow down, woman.
You are not making
any sense.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.760
Shoo! Shoo, shoo.
Get out of here,
you giant rats.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.503
It's happening.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.609
You came back.

16:53.712 --> 16:57.715
Oh, that explosion
did a real number on your face.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.550
( maniacal laughter )

16:59.552 --> 17:00.952
Surprise.

17:02.554 --> 17:03.654
Ludo?

17:03.656 --> 17:05.623
Miss me, princess?

17:08.460 --> 17:09.660
Are you okay?

17:09.662 --> 17:12.163
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.699
Haven't ate it
like that
in years.

17:17.469 --> 17:20.405
You know, I'm really glad
I asked you out.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.607
Me, too.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.651
Marco?
Is everything okay?

17:39.391 --> 17:41.092
We have to find Star.

17:45.197 --> 17:46.664
Get her, get her!

17:51.170 --> 17:52.937
Shimmering crystal see-saw!

17:54.339 --> 17:56.641
( screeching )

17:57.843 --> 17:58.910
Get her!

17:58.912 --> 18:01.312
Rainbow fist punch!

18:06.018 --> 18:09.520
Syrup tsunami shockwave!

18:12.691 --> 18:15.626
You guys
are ruining my séance.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.867
Mega starfish tsunami!

18:30.109 --> 18:33.077
Mystic Suck Portal.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.679
Not again!

18:37.616 --> 18:41.886
I'm back, just like my...
( screams )

18:41.888 --> 18:44.655
Please have mercy on me.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.391
I would have mercy on you.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.146
JANNA: Help!

19:09.681 --> 19:11.315
Bad vermin. Bad.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.817
Janna.

19:22.961 --> 19:26.497
Aw, looks like
you need a hand, princess.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.100
What do you want with me?

19:29.102 --> 19:31.202
You think I'm here for you.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.970
So selfish.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.740
Ha! Fetch!

19:40.179 --> 19:42.380
- My spell book?
- Yes.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.515
I figured it would be
okay if I took it,

19:44.517 --> 19:47.051
seeing how you're
probably not going to need it

19:47.053 --> 19:48.886
where you're going.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.889
( evil laugh )
As the humans say,

19:51.891 --> 19:54.525
destroying you
will be easy as pie.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.261
I think you mean
piece of cake.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.898
You will pay for that.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.800
I'm on fire,
I'm on fire!

20:02.802 --> 20:05.403
Put me out, put me out!

20:07.739 --> 20:09.874
Oh, great job...

20:09.876 --> 20:12.910
Fetch Spider.
We have what we want.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.182
No, no, no, no!

20:18.184 --> 20:20.384
( rats squeaking )

20:20.386 --> 20:22.053
( straining )

20:22.055 --> 20:24.755
Do you really wanna
waste precious time
chasing me?

20:24.757 --> 20:26.090
I mean, look.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.693
Star!

20:28.695 --> 20:31.128
( Ludo cackling )

20:35.734 --> 20:38.069
Marco, let go.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.104
You're gonna
get pulled in, too.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.772
I'm not letting go.

20:49.548 --> 20:51.682
You okay?

20:51.684 --> 20:55.353
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks to you.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.854
Jackie, are you okay?

20:56.856 --> 20:58.889
Yeah. I'm great.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.792
This is the funnest dance
I've ever been to.

21:01.794 --> 21:06.264
MARCO: Yeah, well, I mean, yeah,
we're in a graveyard, so...

21:07.933 --> 21:11.235
I can't believe
Ludo took my spell book.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.237
It's got everything
in it.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.939
That's my whole
family history.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.907
All the spells,
everything, it's lost.

21:16.909 --> 21:19.310
We'll get it back.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.779
I've lost Glossaryck.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.816
We'll get him back, too.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.118
I promise.

21:32.257 --> 21:35.126
At your service, milady.

21:35.128 --> 21:38.896
I'm not a milady.
