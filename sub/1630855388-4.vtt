WEBVTT

00:12.721 --> 00:15.682
Get out! Get back! Go back in there!

00:15.682 --> 00:18.060
Stay down!

00:18.060 --> 00:20.854
Everybody, get down! Get down!

00:25.275 --> 00:26.276
Sit the fuck down!

00:27.528 --> 00:28.695
Thy kingdom come.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.949
Thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.159
You! Yes. Here, now.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.664
Move!

00:40.499 --> 00:41.708
Come here.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.712
Take that, and you tell them--

00:45.712 --> 00:48.882
Tell all of them in that stupid
fucking singsong voice you all do,

00:48.882 --> 00:50.050
that they've got ten seconds.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.468
Ten seconds?

00:51.468 --> 00:54.054
To sit down and shut up!
Otherwise, I'll do another one.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.228
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:02.688 --> 01:06.608
<i>I've just been told that you have
ten seconds to return to your seats.</i>

01:08.443 --> 01:10.988
That's ten seconds
to return to your seats.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.490
For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.325
<i>If you fail to do this,</i>

01:17.786 --> 01:18.912
somebody else gets killed.

01:20.205 --> 01:23.083
- Lizzy! Lizzy?
- Kate, get back to your seat.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.710
Now count it.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.712
- Sorry?
- Count it down!

01:28.130 --> 01:29.590
Lizzy?

01:30.299 --> 01:32.634
- Ten...
- Lizzy, where are you? Lizzy!

01:32.634 --> 01:35.888
- <i>...nine, eight...</i>
- Lizzy. Lizzy!

01:35.888 --> 01:37.264
- Kate!
- <i>...seven...</i>

01:38.724 --> 01:40.642
- Kate, sit down!
- <i>...six...</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:41.935
- Lizzy.
- <i>...five,</i>

01:43.103 --> 01:44.354
<i>four,</i>

01:45.147 --> 01:47.649
three. Quick as you can, please.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.444
<i>Two, one.</i>

01:50.444 --> 01:51.361
Mommy!

01:53.864 --> 01:55.240
Oh, fuck.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.286
Lizzy.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.583
Get back.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.049
Go.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.054
Here we go.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.581
What did you people just do?

02:46.875 --> 02:47.876
Kneel down.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.046
Kneel down.

03:56.195 --> 03:59.114
Yeah. Okay,
I'm gonna explain this once more, okay?

03:59.114 --> 04:00.199
Yeah.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.702
My chances of getting an answer
out of the British government, Betina,

04:03.702 --> 04:05.120
are about as good as yours.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.998
Yeah. Yes, I've passed that on.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.584
And I've passed that on.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.503
Betina, ye--
But this is above my pay grade, you see.

04:12.503 --> 04:13.629
I don't do this sort of thing.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.797
I do the school run,
I buy a meal deal for my lunch

04:15.797 --> 04:17.716
and I make sure the planes
land in the right order.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.801
And then it's home, sleep, repeat.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.768
Then we'll both have to just keep
passing the messages higher, won't we?

04:27.768 --> 04:31.271
That's all we can do. That and stay in
touch. Have a lovely day, Betina. Bye-bye.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.190
Romanian ATC.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.239
- You get a meal deal?
- This is not good. You know that, right?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.952
This is very quickly becoming not good.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.684
<i>Kingdom 2-9, how do you read?</i>

05:08.684 --> 05:10.811
<i>This is Bucharest. Please respond.</i>

05:11.311 --> 05:13.522
<i>Kingdom 2-9, this is Bucharest.</i>

05:14.314 --> 05:18.318
<i>How do you read? Kingdom 2-9,
if you hear this transmission--</i>

05:24.950 --> 05:27.452
<i>Kingdom 2-9, if you fail to respond,</i>

05:27.452 --> 05:30.080
<i>we will be forced to take action.</i>

05:30.080 --> 05:32.499
<i>This situation will escalate.</i>

05:36.753 --> 05:39.381
Phones off, or on silent,

05:39.381 --> 05:42.176
or whatever it is that means
you'll be looking at the foreign secretary

05:42.176 --> 05:44.261
and not them for the next two minutes.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.679
Airplane mode.

05:46.305 --> 05:47.347
Okay. Go.

05:47.973 --> 05:54.521
Right. So, the plane is a
Kingdom Airbus A330, 216 people on board.

05:54.521 --> 05:59.568
The vast majority are UK citizens,
due over central London in about--

05:59.568 --> 06:00.819
Less than four hours.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.198
Which someone has rather ominously
put on screen.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.784
Yeah. So, the plane took off in Dubai,

06:07.784 --> 06:11.788
it's had intermittent contact with ATC.
Now, over Romania.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.041
And these are the people
who don't match their passports?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.459
Yep. Five of them.

06:15.459 --> 06:18.837
They could be from anywhere.
We still don't know what this is.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.548
Romanian interior minister
calling repeatedly.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.343
Find out who these people are.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.054
Do we tell Number Ten, or--

06:27.054 --> 06:30.474
Find out who they are,
what they're doing and why,

06:31.642 --> 06:34.228
and then we'll start making
and taking calls.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.039
Listen...

06:54.039 --> 06:55.958
Clear this mess up.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.461
Do it quietly.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.006
Then you can give him his medicine.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.029
Hey.

07:28.532 --> 07:32.327
Tell him what happened
wasn't because of us. Okay?

07:37.624 --> 07:38.625
Yussuf.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.670
He says it wasn't our fault.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.589
Tell him to shut his mouth...

07:43.589 --> 07:45.674
before I shut it for him.

07:52.723 --> 07:55.309
Right, she's in the bit
between business and the normal seats.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.894
It's the best we could do, yeah?

07:57.394 --> 08:00.272
We drag her right to the back,
people are gonna start freaking out.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.485
You said no one gets killed.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.570
They were out of control.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.072
- We had it covered.
- Okay.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.783
Then if it wasn't then,
it would have been the next time.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.368
It was getting worse. Now look.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.000
We're back in control.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.836
We're doing this for Edgar, remember?

08:23.337 --> 08:27.341
Edgar and John. So we do as we're told,
exactly as we're told, yeah?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.889
Go to the cabin crew.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.140
Keep it on the down-low,
get some first aid.

08:36.683 --> 08:37.643
Hey.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.945
- How'd it go?
- <i>This is what happens</i>

08:47.945 --> 08:49.863
<i>when something goes better
than you could have hoped.</i>

08:50.614 --> 08:53.283
Instead of going home on the Tube
like a normal human being--

08:53.283 --> 08:54.618
<i>You buy things.</i>

08:54.618 --> 08:56.245
I'm not buying things.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.163
That's the adrenaline.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.749
<i>I'm just looking at things I can't afford.</i>

09:01.542 --> 09:02.793
<i>What time are you back?</i>

09:04.545 --> 09:05.546
<i>Daniel?</i>

09:06.880 --> 09:08.757
I got a feeling it's gonna be a late one.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.094
I think I might buy something for Kai.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.555
Just as a thank-you
for being good about us.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.764
- <i>What?</i>
- Well, no.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.641
Obviously,
I know he hasn't been good about us,

09:17.641 --> 09:20.352
but it's just another step to making him
realize I'm with you

09:20.352 --> 09:22.813
and that's not gonna change.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.691
<i>There's no way back for his dad.</i>

09:26.275 --> 09:28.402
There you were,
calling him a good negotiator.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.446
Here to see DCI Gahfoor.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.491
- <i>See you later then.</i>
- Okay.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.083
This is Marsha.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.002
<i>I have a package for Sam Nelson.</i>

09:45.002 --> 09:47.171
<i>Could you just confirm
your address for me, please?</i>

09:47.838 --> 09:50.257
- Address?
- I have flat 30, Berwick House.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.967
- Is that correct?
- Yeah, but--

09:51.967 --> 09:54.178
And will there be someone there
to sign for the package?

09:54.178 --> 09:55.846
<i>He's not gonna be there.</i>

09:55.846 --> 09:58.932
Well, if there's no answer, I'll
just leave the package with the neighbor.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.726
Okay? Thank you.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.479
That's Nelson's address confirmed.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.491
It's all right. He's with me.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.995
Wrong place for all this, isn't it?

10:19.995 --> 10:22.247
Yeah. Well, this is where we were
when it started.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.916
We haven't had time to move since.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.168
One person calls you
while you're trying to buy a cup of coffee

10:26.168 --> 10:27.669
and before you know it...

10:28.295 --> 10:31.882
Erica, this is Daniel.
I want him joining the suspect ID checks.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.008
Has he done a full induction?

10:33.008 --> 10:35.052
So, if you can find him a computer.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.596
Anyone on your system
with a criminal record

10:37.596 --> 10:40.098
known to have visited a UAE
in the past six months.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.266
Is that the foreign secretary?

10:43.810 --> 10:44.853
Currently.

10:59.368 --> 11:00.494
Look at that, Fred.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.457
What do you say to the kind man?

11:07.209 --> 11:10.587
- Why do you have drawings on your neck?
- No, not that. We don't say that.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.173
No, it's a good question.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.552
Well, thank you.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.471
He'll give it his best shot.
Won't you, mate?

11:34.570 --> 11:35.821
'Cause that's a concern right now?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.583
She went to find Lizzy.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.088
That woman.

11:54.756 --> 11:55.966
I know, love.

11:55.966 --> 11:59.011
Don't touch on there.
I'll have to do all that again now.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.037
Lift it so we can see.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.207
- You want me to?
- No.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.293
Yeah. Go on.

12:38.759 --> 12:39.843
Sorry.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.307
What happened?

12:45.307 --> 12:47.851
- In the fight, someone kicked me.
- Kicked you?

12:47.851 --> 12:49.019
I don't know. What's it matter?

12:49.019 --> 12:52.564
Hold it. Stop the blood.
I'll go see what else I can find.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.487
You've not been kicked.
You've been stabbed.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.115
- You need a doctor.
- No one's asking you.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.754
Do you think there'll be one on the plane?

13:17.965 --> 13:19.007
Might as well ask.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.933
You're gonna need something
stronger than that.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.018
We don't have anything else.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.478
Anything. To tie it up.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.397
This is what we have. This.

14:15.397 --> 14:18.775
If I magically had
something else, then I'd use it.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.944
Okay. As long as you're not...

14:22.738 --> 14:23.822
holding anything back.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.368
What's that supposed to mean?

14:31.705 --> 14:34.249
It means you're doing your best to help.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.439
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
if there is a doctor on board,</i>

14:57.439 --> 14:59.149
<i>please make yourself known.</i>

14:59.858 --> 15:03.654
<i>Please put your call light on,
and one of us will come and collect you.</i>

15:04.571 --> 15:08.825
<i>That's a doctor
or a medical professional. Please.</i>

15:14.540 --> 15:15.874
Don't you dare.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.085
- But wha--
- David.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.510
You're bleeding out. Look.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.059
I've got a son your age.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.395
What's that got to do with this?

15:36.895 --> 15:38.313
Nothing. So, shut up.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.025
Look, I'm not gonna just sit here
and let you bleed to death, okay?

15:42.025 --> 15:43.235
I don't care who you are.

15:44.403 --> 15:46.864
- Just not gonna do that.
- You need to stop talking.

15:55.914 --> 15:56.915
Okay.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.091
- You need to hold it tighter.
- Can you help me?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.218
- Can he help me?
- No.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.637
Look, mate, she needs someone
to hold it so she can stick it.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.639
- You're not a doctor.
- No one's a doctor,

16:12.639 --> 16:15.309
but she can't hold it
and stick it at the same time.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.645
Well, we'll get Terry.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.772
Terry?

16:20.772 --> 16:22.357
I can't see Terry.

16:24.109 --> 16:27.321
Look, all we're trying to do
is slow down the bleeding.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.281
But if you don't trust me,
you can keep my hands tied

16:29.281 --> 16:30.616
and just cut me away from this.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.467
Okay. Now, I'm gonna put my hand...

16:49.551 --> 16:50.928
and just push down, okay?

16:53.180 --> 16:54.348
All right. Go.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.642
All right.

16:56.642 --> 16:59.561
Steady here. Just get it round, like,
three or four times.

17:09.905 --> 17:11.031
That's it.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.156
- All right?
- Yeah.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.992
Okay. Can you sit up?
Can you sit up, yeah?

17:14.992 --> 17:16.078
There you go.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.871
All right.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.414
Fuck.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.499
It's all right.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.336
You gotta breathe. Breathe out.

17:26.547 --> 17:27.589
There you go.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.221
I'll go get water.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.646
We're updating his team
and their ambassador,

17:42.646 --> 17:44.940
but he's insisting
he speaks to you direct.

17:47.818 --> 17:51.113
Sorescu. Darius Sorescu.
Romania's interior minister.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.747
Darius.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.791
<i>Louise Aitchison?</i>

18:02.791 --> 18:05.627
It is. We met in Geneva.
I don't know if you remember. It was--

18:05.627 --> 18:07.421
<i>We have a serious problem.</i>

18:07.421 --> 18:10.257
<i>We have an unresponsive plane
heading straight for Bucharest.</i>

18:10.257 --> 18:13.010
- Yes.
- <i>We need answers.</i>

18:26.523 --> 18:27.608
Clever.

18:29.568 --> 18:31.904
- What's that?
- You. You think you're clever.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.574
You gonna be nice to me. Is that it?

18:35.574 --> 18:38.327
Make sure I get painkillers,
doctors and that.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.704
So, what, I'll trust you?

18:41.622 --> 18:43.582
So you can get in me head
and get information?

18:43.582 --> 18:46.293
- Never thought about it.
- It's not gonna work, mate.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.589
- Now that you mention it...
- Yeah. Not with me.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.799
No. I can see that about you.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.093
- I don't slip up like that.
- No, exactly.

18:55.594 --> 18:57.930
What just happened just then,
it's just a one-off.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.892
You know, like,
when you told me Terry's name?

19:03.227 --> 19:04.603
- No.
- That was a one-off.

19:04.603 --> 19:07.564
Doesn't matter. It's not like I could
do anything with the information, mate.

19:07.564 --> 19:08.732
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

19:20.953 --> 19:23.580
Do you wanna know my tactics? My plan?

19:27.251 --> 19:28.585
I just wanna get home, mate.

19:34.842 --> 19:36.218
I don't wanna help you.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.846
But if it buys me a bit of credit,

19:39.346 --> 19:41.640
if it means the next time
you're waving that thing about,

19:41.640 --> 19:44.226
you focus on the guy next to me
and not me, then guess what?

19:45.644 --> 19:47.354
- You'll do it, won't you?
- Yeah, that's right.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.606
You're not helping me.

19:50.274 --> 19:51.275
No.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.610
You're just helping yourself.

19:55.070 --> 19:59.074
And I'm no different from anyone else
on this plane. Including you.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.747
I just wanna get home and see my family.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.376
See my son. See his mum.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.046
Anything else would be a lie.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.554
He's threatening military action.

20:20.554 --> 20:22.973
But we take all that with a pinch of salt,
don't we?

20:22.973 --> 20:25.893
Well, no, not necessarily.
I mean, they might be allies,

20:25.893 --> 20:28.812
but there's nothing we're giving them
that's gonna help put them at ease.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.439
So, if they're worried,
we should be worried.

20:30.439 --> 20:32.191
No, we need to speak to the PM
and do it now.

20:32.191 --> 20:34.359
Otherwise, one day,
when people are poring over this,

20:34.359 --> 20:35.861
they'll wanna know what took us so long.

20:35.861 --> 20:38.530
- Did you see that? Live arse-covering?
- That's not what I'm doing.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.325
That's where his head goes.
Genuinely, his first thought.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.076
Not how he protects the people
on the plane...

20:43.076 --> 20:44.870
- Louise.
- ...how he protects himself.

20:45.871 --> 20:47.039
Extraordinary.

20:47.039 --> 20:49.166
Listen, we need to show
that this is British.

20:49.750 --> 20:53.295
British plane, British passengers.
We are the target, not them.

20:55.547 --> 20:56.548
Keep going.

20:57.925 --> 20:59.801
<i>This is live from ATC Bucharest.</i>

21:00.302 --> 21:01.386
Who am I speaking to?

21:01.386 --> 21:03.347
Alice.
The controller who first flagged this.

21:04.223 --> 21:07.935
<i>You can see our flight just as before,
but now, just next to it...</i>

21:07.935 --> 21:09.269
- An X.
- <i>An X,</i>

21:09.269 --> 21:11.647
<i>because it has
no commercial flight number.</i>

21:12.272 --> 21:14.942
<i>Meaning it's a private, unregistered</i>

21:14.942 --> 21:17.778
<i>or, most likely, military aircraft.</i>

21:20.489 --> 21:23.992
<i>And if you look closely,
it's not the only one.</i>

21:40.676 --> 21:42.302
Close all the blinds.

21:43.428 --> 21:45.556
- Get your fucking blinds down!
- <i>The blinds.</i>

21:45.556 --> 21:47.224
- <i>Close them...</i>
- Everybody, blinds down now!

21:47.224 --> 21:48.642
<i>...and keep them closed.</i>

21:48.642 --> 21:51.186
- You heard what she said! Move! Now! Down!
- Blinds down!

21:51.186 --> 21:53.438
Shut every last fucking blind! Do it!

21:53.438 --> 21:54.565
<i>Face forward.</i>

21:54.565 --> 21:58.527
<i>Do not communicate.
There is nothing for it to see.</i>

21:58.527 --> 22:01.113
You heard him!
You at the back, close the blinds!

22:05.200 --> 22:10.414
Kingdom 2-9, you are flying
in airspace protected by NATO.

22:12.165 --> 22:16.170
<i>Kingdom 2-9, if unable to respond,
wing-rock to acknowledge.</i>

22:16.670 --> 22:18.213
There's a plan in place for this.

22:18.213 --> 22:20.424
If this happens, we ignore 'em.
That's what we said.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.050
They can't do anything.

22:22.551 --> 22:23.844
They can shoot us down.

22:24.553 --> 22:27.973
What? A British plane?
Over some random country?

22:27.973 --> 22:29.141
They'd start a war.

22:29.766 --> 22:32.227
And the further west we go,
the safer it gets.

22:33.145 --> 22:35.522
We will be just fine.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.903
<i>Kingdom 2-9, if you do not respond,</i>

22:40.903 --> 22:42.821
<i>we will be forced to take action.</i>

22:48.744 --> 22:50.370
There'll be a plan for that.

22:52.831 --> 22:56.043
The people who ordered this,
they got a plan for everything.

23:01.924 --> 23:02.966
Can I tell you something?

23:03.967 --> 23:04.968
Yeah.

23:04.968 --> 23:07.304
That thing you stuck on, it's not working.

23:08.514 --> 23:10.182
Feels like the bleeding's getting worse.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.908
Hey. That's a Eurofighter.

23:28.659 --> 23:30.786
Meaning it may well be NATO.

23:30.786 --> 23:32.246
That's good, isn't it?

23:33.080 --> 23:36.124
Britain's NATO. They're on our side.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.960
But we're not the people
they're protecting.

23:38.919 --> 23:40.963
We're what they're protecting people from.

23:41.839 --> 23:43.549
We have to do something!

23:44.132 --> 23:45.926
Communicate. Get them a message.

23:50.806 --> 23:52.224
Stay.

24:09.199 --> 24:12.035
Go to the seat behind. The seat behind.

24:16.540 --> 24:18.125
No. Stay.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.296
What are you doing?

24:23.797 --> 24:25.007
What are--

24:33.432 --> 24:35.017
<i>Skywatch, this is Mars.</i>

24:36.059 --> 24:39.271
We have visual with a figure mid-fuselage.
Stand by.

24:45.819 --> 24:49.364
Contact is female. Age around 30.
Three-zero.

24:50.324 --> 24:51.533
Contact is being attacked.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.076
What did we say to you?

24:53.076 --> 24:55.621
Do not communicate. Don't fuck with me!

24:55.621 --> 24:57.247
You understand? Oy!

24:57.247 --> 24:58.665
Get back!

25:01.376 --> 25:02.836
Attacker is armed.

25:02.836 --> 25:04.713
Confirmed. Attacker is armed.

25:09.927 --> 25:11.303
Do not fucking move.

25:13.889 --> 25:15.265
Get back in your seat.

25:16.767 --> 25:17.768
Move it!

25:26.068 --> 25:27.069
Sit down.

25:34.451 --> 25:35.786
And don't get up again.

25:41.166 --> 25:42.501
We've lost visual.

25:42.501 --> 25:46.922
<i>Copy that.
Stand by. Seeking permission to escalate.</i>

25:47.422 --> 25:48.674
Betina, listen to me.

25:48.674 --> 25:52.427
I'm gonna be honest with you.
At this point, that is the best I can do.

25:52.427 --> 25:53.554
Yes.

25:55.639 --> 25:56.765
Yeah, okay. Very good.

26:00.727 --> 26:01.854
She lost it?

26:01.854 --> 26:04.773
Yeah, she's lost it.
And she's got a point, to be fair.

26:05.816 --> 26:07.943
They've got a non-communicative
passenger plane

26:07.943 --> 26:09.862
heading straight for their capital city.

26:09.862 --> 26:14.157
I mean, if it was the other way around,

26:14.783 --> 26:17.786
if that plane was coming to London
and it carried on ignoring us,

26:18.829 --> 26:20.080
we'd be shooting it down.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.008
I'm gonna die, ain't I?

26:31.008 --> 26:32.426
No, don't say that.

26:32.426 --> 26:35.345
- I am. This is it.
- No. Don't start talking like that. Okay?

26:35.345 --> 26:37.973
As soon as you start talking like that,
your body starts believing it.

26:37.973 --> 26:40.726
You're just like me.
You're gonna go home, all right?

26:41.268 --> 26:44.188
To your family, all right?
To the people you love.

26:44.188 --> 26:45.397
Is this real now?

26:46.481 --> 26:47.691
The people who love you?

26:47.691 --> 26:50.152
Are you helping me for real now?

26:50.152 --> 26:51.862
Yeah, just hold still, mate.

26:54.364 --> 26:57.659
Look at me. I told you,
I've got a son your age.

26:58.202 --> 27:01.163
And if this was happening to him,
I'd want someone to help him too.

27:07.127 --> 27:08.879
Is there a doctor on board, please?

27:09.796 --> 27:11.507
A man needs some help here, please!

27:38.867 --> 27:40.744
Excuse me. Could I speak with you, please?

27:40.744 --> 27:42.579
Anything you wanna say,
you can say from there.

27:42.579 --> 27:44.498
We need to talk to the jets.

27:45.415 --> 27:46.625
We're not doing that.

27:46.625 --> 27:49.795
If I could just explain
to the chap who's in charge.

27:49.795 --> 27:51.046
"Chap"?

27:51.630 --> 27:53.841
- The man in charge.
- He's gonna love that.

27:53.841 --> 27:55.342
If I could just explain, please.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.683
It's coming from him, mate.
We're ignoring them.

28:02.683 --> 28:04.685
- That's what he's decided.
- Why?

28:04.685 --> 28:06.061
- Yeah. Why?
- No.

28:06.061 --> 28:08.272
There's no fucking conversation.

28:08.272 --> 28:10.023
If you're not gonna change your mind,

28:10.023 --> 28:12.109
what's the harm
in just letting him say it?

28:12.109 --> 28:13.402
He's not saying anything.

28:13.402 --> 28:16.738
He's sitting there,
and he's gonna shut the fuck up!

28:17.489 --> 28:18.574
What's this?

28:18.574 --> 28:20.367
I think we should talk to the jets.

28:20.367 --> 28:23.161
We're about to fly over Bucharest.
We're heading straight towards it.

28:23.161 --> 28:24.121
So?

28:25.747 --> 28:27.374
Have we spoken with the jets?

28:28.041 --> 28:30.335
- No.
- Communicated at all?

28:30.335 --> 28:33.380
We're not going to Bucharest.
Don't care about Bucharest.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.174
Yeah, but they don't know that, do they?

28:35.174 --> 28:36.884
To them, we're just a plane
with the blinds down

28:36.884 --> 28:38.844
heading straight towards a capital city.

28:39.428 --> 28:41.013
To them, we're an incoming missile.

28:51.190 --> 28:53.317
Please remove your jets.

28:53.317 --> 28:56.195
<i>Mrs. Aitchison,
you have done nothing to demonstrate</i>

28:56.195 --> 28:58.739
<i>that these people are not a threat
to our country.</i>

28:59.364 --> 29:00.991
<i>You do nothing to help us.</i>

29:00.991 --> 29:03.660
<i>In my position, you would do the same.</i>

29:06.413 --> 29:08.624
Prime Minister's office has been informed.

29:08.624 --> 29:10.250
And told what exactly?

29:10.250 --> 29:13.545
Well, that this is real
and you're leading on it.

29:24.223 --> 29:25.557
Say we're not Romanian.

29:25.557 --> 29:27.559
We've got no interest
or problem with Romania,

29:27.559 --> 29:30.437
or Bucharest or any of that.
We're British. We're going to London.

29:41.114 --> 29:43.784
NATO fighter aircraft,
this is Kingdom 2-9.

29:48.121 --> 29:51.625
This isn't working. NATO fighter aircraft,
this is Kingdom 2-9.

29:51.625 --> 29:52.709
Can you hear me?

29:54.294 --> 29:55.921
Someone done something to these?

29:57.047 --> 29:58.048
Well?

29:58.924 --> 30:00.926
I didn't wanna come on this. I told them.

30:00.926 --> 30:03.887
I said, "I'm not ready for this one."

30:04.471 --> 30:05.472
Shit.

30:07.850 --> 30:11.687
Go get medicine or anything, yeah? Go!

30:15.274 --> 30:19.111
Oy. Hey.
What are you gonna do when we get back?

30:19.111 --> 30:20.195
You go first.

30:20.195 --> 30:22.781
You've got to keep talking,
because the talking helps.

30:22.781 --> 30:26.034
All right? Is there, like, a girlfriend?

30:26.618 --> 30:28.620
No? Hey! Friends? Mates?

30:29.121 --> 30:31.582
How about parents? Hey? Mom? Dad?

30:31.582 --> 30:33.333
- Mom.
- Mom? Yeah?

30:33.333 --> 30:35.419
- Dad died.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

30:35.419 --> 30:37.129
Okay, so, your mom's here,

30:37.129 --> 30:39.298
- and that's who you wanna see.
- Elaine.

30:40.007 --> 30:41.508
- Elaine?
- That's her name. Elaine.

30:42.259 --> 30:43.594
You don't got to tell me her name.

30:43.594 --> 30:44.678
- She's my--
- All right.

30:45.304 --> 30:46.388
She what?

30:46.388 --> 30:48.390
My picture on my phone.

30:54.146 --> 30:57.774
Yeah. I'll get your phone for you, okay?

31:11.496 --> 31:12.873
Someone had medicine. Yeah?

31:13.707 --> 31:15.125
- In the thawbs.
- In what?

31:15.626 --> 31:16.627
In the white.

31:17.711 --> 31:19.671
- These guys?
- What's happening?

31:21.423 --> 31:22.549
Give me that.

31:26.011 --> 31:28.472
- What's this?
- Insulin. It's for diabetes.

31:28.472 --> 31:30.682
What can it do? Can it be a painkiller?

31:31.266 --> 31:32.476
Insulin?

31:35.604 --> 31:36.605
We need medicine.

31:37.439 --> 31:41.360
Painkillers, sedatives, anything.

31:44.905 --> 31:47.616
Stop staring and say something!

31:50.327 --> 31:51.370
Come on!

31:56.083 --> 31:58.877
Hey, you know, the Wi-Fi's on.

31:59.545 --> 32:02.381
So, while we're waiting for Terry,

32:02.381 --> 32:04.091
should we call your mom?

32:04.091 --> 32:06.677
- Yeah.
- Elaine?

32:07.344 --> 32:09.137
And then she can hear your voice.

32:09.137 --> 32:13.392
We'll try not to worry her. All right?

32:13.392 --> 32:15.060
You can say what you've gotta say.

32:16.228 --> 32:17.896
Okay. Yeah.

32:19.565 --> 32:22.901
Okay... Is it "Mum"?

32:22.901 --> 32:26.572
Yeah? 016 32--

32:26.572 --> 32:29.366
Yeah? 960 487?

32:29.366 --> 32:31.785
Yeah, come on.

32:31.785 --> 32:33.579
No, it's 'cause my hands are tied.

32:41.461 --> 32:42.462
Okay, hang on.

32:46.341 --> 32:48.177
It's ringing. Yeah. Here.

32:49.136 --> 32:50.220
It's ringing.

32:56.185 --> 32:57.311
Mum?

32:58.562 --> 32:59.855
Yeah, it's me, Mum.

33:01.607 --> 33:02.608
Mum, I'm sorry.

33:03.984 --> 33:05.777
No, listen, you just listen to me.

33:06.778 --> 33:09.531
I might not-- Mum, listen.

33:11.033 --> 33:12.367
I might not...

33:14.328 --> 33:15.412
I might not see you, Mum.

33:16.163 --> 33:18.373
You see, I've been hurt and...

33:21.084 --> 33:23.128
Well, I'm not feeling too good.

33:27.424 --> 33:29.176
You're gonna hear about it. Yeah?

33:30.135 --> 33:32.179
But I want you
to remember something for me, okay?

33:32.679 --> 33:37.559
None of the things that have
happened, yeah? Like we always said--

33:38.519 --> 33:42.022
None of them
were ever anything to do with you. Okay?

33:42.940 --> 33:44.191
Did you hear what I said?

33:47.277 --> 33:48.904
I wish you were too, Mum.

33:50.656 --> 33:52.950
I wish you were too
but you don't want to be here, Mum.

33:57.579 --> 33:58.789
Listen...

34:02.292 --> 34:04.711
You just need to know
that I love you. Okay?

34:05.796 --> 34:07.548
I'll see you soon, Mum. Okay?

34:09.132 --> 34:10.132
I will.

34:22.437 --> 34:25.023
Shit. Come on, mate. Okay.

34:25.023 --> 34:29.570
Hey, you did good. Hey? Come on.

34:29.570 --> 34:31.530
Come on. You did good. Okay?

34:33.532 --> 34:34.824
Come on.

34:55.762 --> 35:00.392
<i>While we're waiting for Terry,
should we call your mom? Elaine.</i>

35:01.018 --> 35:03.103
<i>And then she can hear your voice.</i>

35:03.103 --> 35:06.690
<i>We'll try not to worry her. All right?</i>

35:06.690 --> 35:09.568
- <i>You can say what you gotta say.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

35:10.319 --> 35:16.909
<i>"Mum"? Yeah? 01632 960 487?</i>

35:18.118 --> 35:19.328
<i>Yeah. Come on.</i>

35:19.328 --> 35:21.622
<i>No, it's 'cause my hands are tied.</i>

35:32.966 --> 35:37.596
So, the PM and her son are heading back
to their hotel from the White Mountains.

35:37.596 --> 35:39.765
We're being asked
to keep the briefings coming.

35:41.350 --> 35:42.351
Explain.

35:43.727 --> 35:47.147
Well, nobody wants to inherit a crisis
if they don't have to.

35:47.147 --> 35:50.567
These White Mountains, wherever they are,
they sound like the perfect place to be.

35:50.567 --> 35:54.613
If she's in the mountains in Crete,
she could almost see the plane fly over.

36:03.372 --> 36:06.041
<i>Five minutes. Stand by.</i>

36:15.217 --> 36:17.761
- Hey, I can't really speak right now.
- <i>It wasn't a false alarm.</i>

36:17.761 --> 36:19.137
It's real, Daniel.

36:19.638 --> 36:21.849
- <i>Marsha.</i>
- But you knew that, didn't you?

36:21.849 --> 36:24.852
<i>I could tell by your voice.
You knew but you kept it to yourself.</i>

36:24.852 --> 36:26.937
- And I'm sorry.
- Why didn't you say something?

36:26.937 --> 36:30.357
<i>There is no point in calling you
until we know exactly what's going on.</i>

36:31.191 --> 36:34.695
- How do you know?
- I got a message from the plane.

36:34.695 --> 36:36.488
- From Sam?
- <i>No.</i>

36:36.488 --> 36:40.075
<i>Yes. It was from another number,
but it was Sam speaking with another man.</i>

36:40.075 --> 36:42.536
<i>And they mentioned some names,
and they mentioned a phone number.</i>

36:42.536 --> 36:43.704
- Wait.
- <i>And it sounded...</i>

36:44.788 --> 36:48.584
- <i>Sounded?</i>
- Daniel, it sounded serious.

36:48.584 --> 36:50.085
Okay, listen to me, Marsha.

36:50.085 --> 36:51.920
I'm gonna need you
to send me that message.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.213
Send me that message right now.

36:53.213 --> 36:55.924
- I don't know how to do that.
- I'm gonna tell you how.

36:55.924 --> 36:57.342
<i>I don't know what's happening.</i>

36:57.342 --> 37:00.387
Marsha, this is the only contact
we've had from the plane.

37:00.387 --> 37:03.974
So, this is vital.
Now, it might be a mistake

37:04.474 --> 37:08.478
or it might be Sam trying
to communicate details, numbers.

37:08.478 --> 37:10.480
<i>What do you mean "communicate"?</i>

37:10.480 --> 37:13.317
Marsha, this is the man you told me about.

37:14.568 --> 37:16.069
He's trying to sort it out.

37:16.069 --> 37:19.740
Is there a doctor on board?
Anyone? Please!

37:21.200 --> 37:23.869
Is there a doctor
or a nurse on board, please?

37:33.378 --> 37:34.713
Don't you--

37:43.388 --> 37:44.389
I'm a doctor.

37:45.724 --> 37:47.726
<i>Three minutes. Prepare to engage.</i>

37:47.726 --> 37:49.895
Confirm that is the order.

37:49.895 --> 37:52.022
<i>Affirmative. That is the order.</i>

37:53.065 --> 37:54.816
He's hardly getting any oxygen.

37:56.318 --> 37:59.112
We're gonna need something
to pierce through his chest.

37:59.112 --> 38:00.989
A tube, something he can breathe through.

38:02.282 --> 38:03.283
What about a pen?

38:14.169 --> 38:15.587
- Hello.
- <i>The guy in the seat behind me,</i>

38:15.587 --> 38:16.839
<i>he's got a Biro.</i>

38:16.839 --> 38:19.550
<i>Bring it. He's gonna stop breathing.</i>

38:19.550 --> 38:24.263
<i>...1632. Yeah? 960 487?</i>

38:25.973 --> 38:27.224
That's Bushey, Hertfordshire.

38:27.224 --> 38:29.434
An L. Atterton and an S. Atterton.

38:30.602 --> 38:31.603
This is it.

38:32.145 --> 38:34.731
This could prove this is our problem,
not Romania's.

38:37.359 --> 38:40.153
<i>Two minutes.
Confirmed for weapons release.</i>

38:41.238 --> 38:42.447
Are you sure about this?

38:42.447 --> 38:44.908
<i>Mars, you will obey the order.</i>

38:45.409 --> 38:46.493
Copy that.

38:50.539 --> 38:53.750
This is huge organized crime,
international in scale,

38:53.750 --> 38:55.836
but all of it based here.

38:57.004 --> 38:59.923
That's what we tell them.
These hijackers are British.

38:59.923 --> 39:02.342
- <i>We are out of time.</i>
- We are allies.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.018
He's stopped breathing.

39:18.609 --> 39:20.068
<i>Mars. Engage.</i>

39:24.448 --> 39:26.241
<i>Mars. Please confirm.</i>

39:27.367 --> 39:29.995
Weapons hot. We have lock.

39:30.495 --> 39:33.665
<i>They're in position.
The order is about to be given.</i>

39:33.665 --> 39:35.375
<i>We fire in 60 seconds.</i>

39:40.380 --> 39:44.384
Darius, stop.
These are confirmed British nationals.

39:44.384 --> 39:48.972
We are the target. You are not the target.
It's not terrorism.

40:03.654 --> 40:05.656
<i>Abort. Abort. Disengage.</i>

40:06.865 --> 40:09.535
Copy that. Weapons cold.

40:10.285 --> 40:11.453
Returning to base.

40:17.084 --> 40:19.962
- Oh, shit.
- He's breathing?

40:19.962 --> 40:21.046
He is.

40:22.047 --> 40:24.216
Come on, mate. Okay?

40:25.342 --> 40:26.343
Okay?

41:01.420 --> 41:03.422
Hey, they've gone.

41:03.922 --> 41:04.923
Turn around.

41:13.891 --> 41:15.601
Hey! Back in your seat!

41:15.601 --> 41:17.269
- Tell them they can open the blinds.
- No!

41:17.269 --> 41:18.478
You can open the blinds.

41:18.478 --> 41:21.315
- Open the windows. They've gone!
- Do not. Do not open the blinds.

41:21.315 --> 41:23.275
- The jets have gone. Let them see out.
- Stop!

41:23.275 --> 41:25.277
- Keep those windows shut.
- Let them see out.

41:25.277 --> 41:27.779
- Let them see the jets have gone.
- Listen to me. Keep them shut!

41:27.779 --> 41:29.364
The jets have gone.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.368
- Keep them shut! Stop!
- They've gone.

41:34.786 --> 41:36.705
Close the fucking blinds!

41:52.012 --> 41:53.472
That should hold for now.

41:59.770 --> 42:00.771
Okay.

42:05.025 --> 42:08.695
The Wi-Fi is on,
he wanted me to help him call Elaine.

42:11.114 --> 42:13.116
He wanted her to hear his voice.

42:21.792 --> 42:23.252
Every son needs their mother, right?

42:39.309 --> 42:40.561
Kai?

42:47.901 --> 42:48.902
Kai?

42:55.242 --> 42:56.243
Kai?

43:20.893 --> 43:22.227
Home Secretary?

43:22.227 --> 43:24.646
- Excuse me.
- No, it's okay.

43:29.443 --> 43:30.819
I look forward to speaking.

43:35.782 --> 43:36.783
Good luck with it.

43:36.783 --> 43:39.953
Thank you. Right. Sinclair Road.

43:47.586 --> 43:49.171
By the way, Lang's office just postponed.

43:49.171 --> 43:52.925
They're offering Thursday
or the following Monday.

43:54.009 --> 43:56.345
You know, I have half a mind
to take it out the diary completely.

43:56.345 --> 43:59.056
This is the second time they've done it.
So unreliable.

43:59.056 --> 44:00.641
- It's either that or wait--
- Lawrence.

44:00.641 --> 44:03.685
Get the foreign secretary on the line, please.

44:06.104 --> 44:07.105
Now!
