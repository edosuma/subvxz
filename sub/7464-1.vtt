01:29.000 --> 02:05.000
Here we go.
Come on.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Come on, seven!

02:08.000 --> 02:28.000
What are you doing
at the house of God?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
This is where I grew up.
Mott Street.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
I'm Charlie Luciano.
In my neighborhood
there were two dons.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Two bosses, each fightin'
for control of New York.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
And sometimes innocent people
got caught in the middle.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I got a right to
drink a glass of wine!

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
I got a right to find work
that uses my brain!

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
You clean the fish and the
calamari,just like me!

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
What are you sayin'?
'Cause I'm a greasy immigrant,
all I can do is clean fish?

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
That ain't enough, Pop!

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Buon giorno.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Che cazzo "buon giorno".
You come in my house, hmm?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
You tell the
son of a bitch Faranzano,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
the miserabile bestia.
I give him-

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh.
Don Faranzano.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Faranzano.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Faranzano, I no
mean what I say.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
You have been very loyal.
Done favors for me.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
Always made your
payments on time.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Now, you've stopped paying.
I have to ask myself, ''Why?''

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
No, no. Faranzano,
Mia piccola bambina she's sick.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
I no have the money.
I no got the money.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
Fat pig.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
When I came from Sicily,
you went with me.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Now, you're drifting back
to that fat pig, Masseria.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
- No! Faranzano-
- You are, I see.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
No, no, no.
Tu sei mi padrone- Aaah!

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
I can't take chances.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
If one man can desert me,
everybody can. Understand?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes.

04:25.000 --> 04:36.000
If you have to sell your
daughter, you will pay!

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
You have a pretty wife.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
Usually, after children,

04:43.000 --> 04:53.000
they get fat.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Nice sweet taste.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Disgraziato.!
Get out of my house!

05:01.000 --> 05:13.000
I felt your balls, so I
know why she needs her own.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Figlio mio,
put down the knife.

05:18.000 --> 05:31.000
You'll have your
chance one day.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
That was one boss.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Don Faranzano.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Some things change
your life forever.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Yeah, I know.
I know. Loyalty.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
My father sweated
blood for him.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
The guy with me here
is Frankie Costello.
Loyalty, Frankie, yeah?

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
He and Joey DeCarlo were
my two best friends.
ThatJoey?

05:57.000 --> 06:13.000
But on these streets
friends were hard to keep.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Don Masseria.!
Don Masseria.!

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Lo bisogno, per favore.
Chi e chieste?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Look at this.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Lo bisogno aiuto,
per favore.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Chi e chieste?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
No, don't!

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Sono sangue.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Terrible what these
niggers are doin'.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
They come down from Harlem,
kill my own nephew.

06:42.000 --> 06:52.000
Right in front
of my face.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
My son.!

06:54.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh.!
Oh, no, my God.!

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh, my son!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Joey.!

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Oh,Joey!

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
Oh,Joey!
Oh, my God! Oh,Joey!

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
That was the other boss.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Don Masseria.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Some way, some time,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
no matter how
long it took,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I knew what
I had to do...

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
to both bosses.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
He kills his own blood,
you know?

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I mean his own nephew.
What kind of man is that, huh?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
And on top of that,
he pays some Irish to do it.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Uh! Ah!

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
The law of the street was:
take or be taken.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Everybody fought everybody.
Irish, Italians, Germans,Jews.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
But this was different.
This was that Irishman
who killed Joey.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Beatin'up on some skinny
Jewish kid, Meyer Lansky.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
And theJewish kid
wouldn't stay down.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Meyer wouldn't give
no matter how bad he got it.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
You had to respect that.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Meyer's big pal
was Benny Siegel.
Leave him alone!

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Benny loved a good fight.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Even a bad fight,
but they wouldn't
let him in on this one.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
What is it? You in love
with the littleJew boy?
No.

08:24.000 --> 08:39.000
Joey was
a friend of mine!

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
Meyer.!

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
What the hell's
everybody looking at?

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
He just
saved your life.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Come on.

08:52.000 --> 09:02.000
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
So that's how we started.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Two Italians and twoJews.
Funny combination, huh?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Frankie--he liked to worry,
so he paid off the cops.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Benny liked to brawl,
so he was our muscle.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
And me and Meyer--
we were both the leader.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
At least it
started out that way.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Just four mugs
off the street.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
At first we were penny-ante,
but together we grew.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Thing that worries me is
things is goin' too good.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Relax.
How can I relax?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
When everything's goin' right,
you know it's gonna go wrong.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
We can't keep operating
like four kids running
around the neighborhood.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
That's what I mean.
If we're going to
expand, we need a leader.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
And who's that
gonna be, huh?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Tommy's meetin'
us over here.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
After you.
Please,
be my guest.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Thank you.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
I got 'em comin'up
right now, sir.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Do like I said
with the kid.
Okay.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
What is this, huh?
You'll see.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Charlie, come sta?

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
How's everything?
Meyer.
Good to see you.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I got everything ready
for you in the back.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
What do you got
to show me, huh?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
It's a little
experiment.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
You asked me a question.
I'm gonna answer it.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Come here.
Yeah.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
He's telling this kid
there's a guy here,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
very powerful, successful,
who's got a job for him.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Easy money.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
You got that?
Good, get out of here.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Let's go.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Now he realizes.

10:51.000 --> 11:23.000
Bugsy didn't tell him,
right? Me or you.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Got a job for me?

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
You just did it, kid.

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
Get lost.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Now do
you see?

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Between you and me,
we're equals.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
But other people,
they look to you.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
What're you sayin', huh?
I'm your front man?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
No.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
This ain't a con, Charlie.
You're it.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
You're the one.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Tommy Reina,
Charlie, Meyer.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Good pal, gonna even
be a better partner.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
From your mouth
to God's ear, hmm?

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
He's got a line
on the good stuff.
How good?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Bottle in Bond
Scotch Whiskey.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I got a friend got a boxcar
sittin' on a spur in Philly.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
He wants 3 5 G's.
I only got 1 0.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Ahhh.
Who's this friend?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Arnold Rothstein.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
No disrespect, Tommy.
Why would Rothstein wanna do
business with bums like us?

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
'Cause some of us are
Jewish bums. Right?

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
You'll find out Monday night
when you go to his hotel.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
No one ever
called you all bums.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Come on.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
It's very
good stuff.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Come on in, fellas.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
I want you to meet the genius
who fixed the World Series.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
Mr. Arnold Rothstein.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
This here's
Charlie Luciano...

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
and Meyer Lansky.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Tommy, thanks.
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
Well, sit down.
Sit down.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Mr. Luciano,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
you're walking
down the street.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Suddenly you realize
you're being followed. It's a hit.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Walking toward you
is a second gunman.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
You have time to fire at only
one of them. Which one do--

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
I don't accept the question.
To live, I gotta kill 'em both.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Next,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
your wife--
I don't have a wife.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
- Why not?
- Emotion is dangerous.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
- Aren't you human?
- Would it help?

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
Next. I have ships
and distilleries in Scotland.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I need distribution
in New York.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Masseria?
Faranzano?
They'd kill me.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
- I won't?
- You haveJewish partners.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
Maybe I kill them too.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
You can't afford to.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
You're in the squeeze.
Masseria has 700 soldiers.
Faranzano, 600.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
Either one realizes you exist,
they squash you like an ant.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Unless I get a
powerful friend, huh?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Exactly.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Next.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
What's the
secret of America?

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
What's the matter with
this guy? I'm 24 years old--

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Money!

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
Everything is
money, Charlie.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Don't ever forget it.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
But you, you'll
never make any money.

14:59.000 --> 15:15.000
- Why's that?
- You dress like a schmuck.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
Ah-ha.

15:21.000 --> 15:38.000
Let's do
some business.

15:38.000 --> 15:50.000
Check it.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
It's raining money.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
We got money
to burn, Charlie.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Wanna burn some?
Want to? Want to?

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
Be my guest.
All right!

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Everybody ready?

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
The party.
Our first million.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Paisan, you ready
to make some money?
I'm ready.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
- I'm always ready.
-Just don't hog all the broads.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I can't help it.
They're all over me.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
Tell us something
we don't know, huh?
Gentlemen,

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
before we go,
let's have a toast.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Our first
million dollars.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Say this bottle is bootleg
business, greater New York.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
This is our business
when we started.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Nobody noticed us,
nobody gave a shit.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
Now this is our
business right now.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It's big enough for
us to have a party.

16:48.000 --> 17:01.000
Big enough for
other people to notice.

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
This is where we want
our business to be.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
But the bigger we get,

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
the more we're taking
from other people.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Thanks.
Masseria's
already calling us.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Faranzano, calling.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
You see what I'm saying?
Yeah. I didn't
get no whiskey.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
I'm saying this.

17:29.000 --> 17:37.000
If we're
not careful--

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
Charlie.!
Hey.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
I got the room
in the back for ya's.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Father,
how are you?

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
Tommy, you bum,
you look beautiful.

17:53.000 --> 18:01.000
How you doin'?
Good to see you.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
The table looks beautiful.

18:04.000 --> 18:14.000
Hey!
Giovanni!

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
People will love
to play numbers.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
It's smart business. Somebody
hits big, you gotta publicize.

18:21.000 --> 18:27.000
All right. I'll get
somebody downtown.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
Anna Citron,
these are my partners.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Frank Costello.
Hello.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Benny Siegel.
Hi.

18:43.000 --> 18:50.000
And um, these are
their girlfriends.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
He has
two girlfriends?
At least.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Salute.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Charlie, this is my girl.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
I want you to meet
Anna Citron.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
My goodness,
I'm honored.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Sit down.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
You met my priest?
Anna Citron, this is Meyer Lansky.
Hello.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
This here is
Father Bonotto.
Buona sera, signorina.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Buona sera.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
Father!
Ah, Tommy, you stupid
bootlegger from the Bronx.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Charlie,
I want to talk to you.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
You see, this is why
alcohol is outlawed.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
You son of a bitches, uh?

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
They're
threatening us.
Then talk
to the bosses.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
You mean buy
ourselves some time.
Exactly.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
I agree.

19:49.000 --> 19:56.000
Hey, Frankie.
We made it.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Let me tell you this.
Watch your back, all right?

19:58.000 --> 20:06.000
Good.
Yeah.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
So,

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
you talked
to Rothstein?
Yeah.
He worries too much.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
So do I.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
Faranzano wants to
meet in the morning.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
I think
we should go.
Not yet.
Let him beg.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
[ Meyer ]
He is begging.

20:28.000 --> 20:46.000
Aaah!

20:46.000 --> 21:00.000
Meyer!

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Aaah!

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
Move! Move!

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
You okay, Meyer?

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Anna?
Yeah.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
- That's twice I saved your life.
- You're telling me.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
I hate owing somebody.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Listen, we're meeting
Faranzano in the morning.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Whatever you say,Meyer.
Good.

21:27.000 --> 21:47.000
You all right,
Anna?

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
Don Faranzano.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Have we met?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Maybe around
the neighborhood.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
When I
was a kid.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
This is my associate,
Meyer Lansky.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
I don't talk
business with Jews.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
You talk business with me.
If Meyer works with me,
that ain't your concern.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
Let's be blunt.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
If you go with Masseria,
maybe he wins.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
If you go with me,
maybe I win.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
This seems to give you
a lot of power.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
So what're you
offering me?

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
Masseria's the boss of
all bosses. I respect him.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
He's a fat pig.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
I offer you this.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
Join my family.
We combine all operations.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
You'll get
1 5 percent.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
Yes?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Well, it's a very
handsome offer.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
We have to
think it over.
That means no.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
Means what it means. We have
to talk with our partners.

22:59.000 --> 23:15.000
Show them out.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Fifteen percent, huh?

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
You know how much
money that is?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Well, I don't,
and neither do you.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
But it's a hell of a lot.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Fifteen percent?

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
As soon as we sold to Faranzano,
he'd knock you off.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
Why would
he do that?
You're Sicilian.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
One day you
might wanna be boss.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
If he iced you now,
there would be a stink,

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
but if you're workin' for him,
who's gonna come after him?

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
Who is gonna give
a fucking shit, except us.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And we'd be history.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
He's right, Charlie.

23:57.000 --> 24:06.000
That's why we're in partnership
with theseJews, Frankie.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Excuse me.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
How're you, Charlie?
Right this way.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Show Mr. Luciano his table.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Hey, Charlie!

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Nice to see ya.
Good to see you.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
I heard you told
Faranzano to go fly.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
I told him
I'd think it over.
Always so polite?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Now you come to
seeJoe, the boss?

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
It's a very smart move, Charlie.
Everybody needs protection.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Even me.

24:35.000 --> 24:46.000
Where is he?
He's up in
his balcony.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
You oughta come
aboard, Charlie.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
We're just one big pasta-eatin'
family over here. All right.

24:50.000 --> 25:02.000
I'll see
you later.
All right.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Hi.

25:04.000 --> 25:15.000
Hi.

25:15.000 --> 25:24.000
Geez.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I don't believe my eyes.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
It's me.
Hey, Charlie!
Come on, sit down.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
I send messages, send flowers
and you don't come to see me.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
I had some things I had to
straighten out with Faranzano.

25:42.000 --> 25:48.000
I heard. You won't marry him--
that's beautiful.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
Still, you won't go to bed with me,
and I'm so gorgeous.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
I know. I've always held
a warm spot for you,Joe.

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
Your nephewJoey
was a friend of mine.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
It's too bad,
Charlie.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Charlie,
you belong in this family.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Someday I will
join you,Joe.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
- You don't like today?
- No. No, I don't like it.

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
It's too bad, Charlie.
I've seen a lot come and go.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Guys just like you.

26:28.000 --> 26:35.000
The ones who come,
they come to me.
The ones who go--

26:35.000 --> 26:41.000
I'm the guy
who sends them off.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Hey, you want
a little broccoli?

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
- No. No, thank you.
- Come on, it's full of garlic.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
It looks wonderful, but I
gotta get back downstairs.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Enjoy the show.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
What do you think?
I don't trust him.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
You don't trust anybody.
I doubt that you trust me.

27:02.000 --> 28:15.000
He's stringing
us along.
Yeah.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Hi.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
You boys enjoy the show?
Park it here,
baby.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
How're you doin'?

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Great. Couldn't be better.
Got a light?

28:26.000 --> 28:42.000
A light? For you,
I'd burn down this whole joint.

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
Excuse me,Joe. I hate to interrupt,
but can I talk to my sister?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
This is your sister?

28:49.000 --> 28:56.000
Yeah. Go ahead.
Be my guest.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
It's nothin'.
Just relax. Whoa!

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
Thanks.
No problem.

29:02.000 --> 29:16.000
It's not really my
favorite part the job.
I could see that.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
It's a nice-nice outfit.
Thanks.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
What's your name?

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
Mara Motes. Somebody said
you're Charlie Luciano.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
Let's just say I'm somebody
who believes in his friends.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Good.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
Maybe you and I can
be friends sometime.

29:39.000 --> 29:46.000
Yeah. Yeah. I could pick you
up after the show if you like.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
You sure you
wanna do that?

29:50.000 --> 29:56.000
If you want
to be somebody's friend,
it takes time, doesn't it?

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
I guess it does.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
I should
really get back.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Okay.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
Bye.

30:08.000 --> 30:14.000
Bye.

30:14.000 --> 30:25.000
Friends, huh?

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
Yeah?
Charlie, it's Meyer.
We got hit.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
We got no shipment
New Year's Eve.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
We gotta see Rothstein.
Right.

30:35.000 --> 30:48.000
Now.!

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
We're supposed to meet
Mr. Rothstein.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Yes.
Of course.

30:54.000 --> 31:02.000
Hey, you know
where to find me.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm Benny Siegel.
You heard of me?
No, not really.

31:06.000 --> 31:15.000
What do you do?
I kill people.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
Who hit us?
Masseria or Faranzano?
Probably Masseria.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
But who knows?
Could be either one.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
I'm the first guy
to worry,

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
but doesn't
everybody get hijacked.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
You think this was
business as usual?

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
I shouldn't have to
explain this to you!

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
Next week, our customers will
be buying our scotch from them.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
In a month, I'll lose my distillers
toJoseph fucking Kennedy.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
And we'll all be
out of business!

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
We gotta get tough.
Yeah!

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
Only, we can't
afford a war.

31:58.000 --> 33:08.000
They got armies;
we don't.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Happy New Year,
honey.

33:10.000 --> 33:17.000
Balls and brains. You got 'em,
you don't need an army.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
A hundred years ago,

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
Austria was run by
a prince named Metternich.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Austria was weak,
its neighbors strong,

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
but Metternich was
a cold, calculating fox.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
If one country
got too strong,

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
he organized
an alliance against it.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
He would bring Europe
to the brink of war,

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
then everybody thanked him
when he kept war from happening.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
He barely
had an army?

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
But he had Europe
by the kishkes.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
We gotta send a signal.
Nobody messes with our stuff.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
We have a shipment landing.
Cape May, tomorrow night.

33:55.000 --> 34:46.000
This is a perfect
opportunity to set a trap.

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
Aaah! Aaah!

34:52.000 --> 35:19.000
Cowards!

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
Try this again,
I will kill your mothers,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
fuck your sisters and turn
your brothers into eunuchs.

35:27.000 --> 35:34.000
I think you've made your
point, Benny. Let's go.

35:34.000 --> 35:41.000
Tony No Nose. Well, well,
this is a surprise.

35:41.000 --> 35:49.000
Give our regards
to Don Faranzano.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
Who's next?

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
You wanna
start a war?
I don't mind.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
Well, I do. Sometimes you're
so stupid I can't stand it.

35:59.000 --> 36:12.000
Let's go.
Move it. Move it.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
I knew it. You had to
kill him, didn't you?

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
In 2 4 hours,
Faranzano comes after us.
So?

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
So? We can't fight him.
We ain't got the guns.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Masseria does.
Masseria?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
We're goin'
with Masseria?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
He ain't so bad.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
He's a fat, stupid fuck!

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Other than that,
I guess he's swell.

36:36.000 --> 36:42.000
Frankie, right now, this fat
stupid fuck can save our lives.
Remember, it's only temporary.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
A few more stupid moves
like that, they'll knock
us over like bowling pins.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
It's time to play
with the big boys.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah, I used to be
skinny like you.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Hey, pay attention!

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
I'm talkin'
for a reason here.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
I used to move fast,
jump fast, dodge bullets.

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
Fourteen! Fourteen
with my name on it.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
Yet, never a scratch
on this beautiful body.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
So I realized,
hey, I can't be hit.

37:20.000 --> 37:26.000
So, why be skinny? Eat!
That's what we are here for.

37:26.000 --> 37:32.000
- What are you here for?
- I wanna talk details.

37:32.000 --> 37:38.000
Yeah, I hear
you got some trouble, huh?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
You hear wrong.

37:40.000 --> 37:46.000
I hear you gotta join my family
to stay alive another 2 4 hours.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
I don't deal
from weakness.
Hey.!

37:50.000 --> 37:55.000
You sit down.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I like you...

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
up to a point.

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
What are the details?

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
I'm number two, above everybody.
Including Catania here.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
We get a fair piece
of all the action,

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
and everything from me and my
associates goes into the pot.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Everything.

38:19.000 --> 38:28.000
Except whiskey. The booze
stays with us and Rothstein.

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
So, my family
shares in everything,

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
except--

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
The whiskey, huh?

38:40.000 --> 38:51.000
Right.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
You suckin' bastard!

38:55.000 --> 39:06.000
You son of a
flea-bitten bitch!

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Thank God
I can't kill him now.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
He made such a tough deal.
He's no phony.

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
You and me together,
Faranzano is a dead man.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
In six months,

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
you pass
the whiskey to me,

39:27.000 --> 39:38.000
or I kill you.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
You're part
of the family.

39:43.000 --> 39:49.000
Ah, that's my boy.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
It's not a question of numbers.
Anyone can rack up numbers.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
It's how you do it.
It's a question of style.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
I don't kill
with style?
You don't know
how to kill at all.

39:58.000 --> 40:11.000
Gentlemen, sit down.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Very interesting to
see you again, Mr. Coll.

40:14.000 --> 40:20.000
Again?

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
About three years ago, you
ambushed me and Meyer here.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Oh, yeah.

40:27.000 --> 40:36.000
By the old way
of doing things, I should let
Benny shoot you in the head now.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
But I'm not
gonna do that.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
So, you're not
gonna kill me.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
So?

40:46.000 --> 40:53.000
- So, we have a problem.
- Name him. He's dead!

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
Our problem is you.
See, you freelance.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
When you hit people on
our turf, it upsets the cops.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
No!

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
Plus, you're very,
very good at what you do.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
I figure, I upset somebody else,
you don't miss a second time.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
That's my motto.

41:13.000 --> 41:23.000
Nothing so pretty as the
back of a man's head, huh?

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
What, you want Mad Dog
to go back to sellin' argyles?

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
No, we want Mad Dog...

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
to move
his operations out west.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Los Angeles,
San Francisco.

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
We promise to keep
you very, very busy.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
Out west?

41:45.000 --> 41:52.000
I'll think about it.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
I'll let you know.

41:55.000 --> 42:09.000
Gentlemen.

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
Maybe we should
just kill him.
No. He could
be useful.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
Let's just see if he
leaves town. Okay?

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Yeah.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
Yeah, sure.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
Gloria.!
Hi!

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
Hey, Mara.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
Yeah?
Could you come out
here for a minute?

42:32.000 --> 42:38.000
Sure.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Hi.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Let's go upstairs.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Gambling doesn't start
till midnight. Okay?
Okay.

42:47.000 --> 42:56.000
Come on.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
Ah, I'm sorry I haven't been
in to see you. I had business.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't?

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
No. I knew you'd be back.
You believe in fate?

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
I don't know.
I do.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
Some people are born to be
chorus girls and dog catchers,

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
and other people,
people like you,

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
have something they
don't even realize.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
What don't
I realize?

43:23.000 --> 43:38.000
I can't tell.
Wouldn't be fair.

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
There's another kind of fate.
Between two people.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
I mean,
why did I meet you?

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
You're very gentle,
you know that?
I am?

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
Very.

43:54.000 --> 44:02.000
Most guys, tell 'em you want
to be friends and they skip town.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
But you really can,
can't you?

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
Can what?
Be my friend.

44:10.000 --> 44:27.000
I'd like to be.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
I gotta ask you a question.
Not that I'm complaining,

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
but if we're gonna be friends,
why did you kiss me?

44:37.000 --> 44:44.000
If somebody's your friend,
you can trust them, right?

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
With anything?
Yeah.

44:48.000 --> 46:33.000
Yeah.

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
Do me a favor?
I would do
anything for you.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Don't forget
we're friends.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
Once you throw
sex into the kitty,
guys forget their manners.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
I won't
forget mine.

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
Or they start getting all
goo-goo and talking about love.

46:54.000 --> 47:00.000
Love is a very confusing thing
which I personally do not understand.

47:00.000 --> 47:11.000
Well,
neither do I.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
Can we
do this again?
I gotta go to work.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
I don't mean right now,
I mean, um--

47:17.000 --> 47:23.000
Sure. I can do it as often
as you can. Probably more.

47:23.000 --> 47:29.000
I'm sure.

47:29.000 --> 47:39.000
I'll see
you later.
Okay.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
Don't fall asleep.

47:43.000 --> 47:53.000
I won't.

47:53.000 --> 47:58.000
Hey,
how's it going?

47:58.000 --> 48:10.000
Lansky's inside.
He is?

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
Hey.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
What're you doin'?

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
Drinkin'.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
Straight?
Yeah.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
Beauty.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
I got a serious
question for you.

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
Ask away.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
You wanna
sleep with Anna?

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
What?
My girl, Anna.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
I'm offering
her to you.

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
She's...
very beautiful, Meyer.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
I happen
to think this.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
But she's
not my type.

48:57.000 --> 49:02.000
She's not your type?
Why isn't she your type?

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
Because she's
your type.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
You're turning
down this offer?

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
That's right.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
I'm marrying her next week.
Or month.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
We're not gonna rush it.
But I'm gonna marry her.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Congratulations.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
Maybe you'll stop with all
these ridiculous questions.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
Friendships, Charlie,
they never get tested.

49:26.000 --> 49:33.000
You and me, if we're gonna
stay in this business,

49:33.000 --> 49:42.000
we gotta know we
can trust each other.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
So you're, uh,
you're getting married?

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
There's this
Yiddish expression:

49:48.000 --> 49:54.000
"A wedding is like a funeral,
but with musicians."

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
The reception...

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
should be an excellent
business opportunity.

50:00.000 --> 50:05.000
Meyer, what, uh, what if
I'd said yes about Anna?

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Oh, that you wanted
to shtup her?

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
Yeah. What if
I'd said that?

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
- I would've killed you.
- You would've tried to kill me.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Oh, no.
I would've done it.

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
All right.
Let's just say...

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
for friendship's sake
that we're both equally strong.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
And we both
would've died.

50:27.000 --> 50:32.000
Okay, for
friendship's sake,

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
I'll-I'll say this.

50:36.000 --> 51:16.000
Even if
it ain't true.
[ Thunderclap ]

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Smile.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
Oh, God.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
I'm gonna get sick
from this goddamn wine.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
Why don't we get some Corvo
or something like that?

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Excuse me,
Mr. Siegel.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Have you met my daughter,
Rachel?
No, I haven't.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
She was voted the
prettiest girl in school.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
Very pretty.
She's not a
bad cook, either.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Oooh,
that's important.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
They got those things
called ''kreplach.''

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
That's like ravioli.
And they got this thing...

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
called a ''blintz.''
It's like manicotti.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
I love manicotti.
Yeah, right here.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
Then they got that.
That's matzo balls.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
It's like a big hunk
of soggy bread.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
Oh, God, that
looks like brains.
Yes.

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
Oh, no, I don't want that.
Charlie?

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
How's family business?

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
It's up 3 5 percent
since I came on.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Ahh, that's good.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
See if you can get
someone to get me...

52:17.000 --> 52:23.000
some of that, uh,
ravioli crap.
I got some.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
Prohibition... ain't
gonna last forever.
Yes.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
We're gonna go with booze
and smokes best we can.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
I got this... crazy idea.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
- The big plan is this.
- We're gonna take the unions.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
- The unions.
- Garment workers.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
- The longshoremen.
- Not just New York unions.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
- Chicago.
- The whole fucking country.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
- The West Coast.
- What are you gonna do about...

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Don Masseria?
He's an old man.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
- Masseria?
- What are you worried about?

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
- I just wanna run things.
- I'm not worried.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
- A little more control.
- You gotta watch your back.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Masseria?
What should we
do about him?

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
I think it's
very tricky.
Yeah?

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
You should consider
many things with him.

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
You have something
in mind, I hope?
Yes, we do.

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
[ Sonny ]
Rothstein's
behind it.

53:10.000 --> 53:20.000
Then Rothstein
must die.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
Cash, money, unions.
I see what you're doing.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
If I see,
Masseria sees.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
Everybody dies,
Charlie.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
I know.

53:36.000 --> 53:42.000
This thing'll blow up
in your face.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
When?
I don't know.

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
You give me such naches.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Naches?

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
It's like pride, when a son
makes his father proud of him.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Look at you!
You're bigger than me now!

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
Eh.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
When war comes,
and it'll come,

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
the winner will be the one
who gets his enemy to trust him.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
How do I do that?

54:14.000 --> 54:24.000
You save his life.

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
Crew's takin'
steam tomorrow.

54:28.000 --> 54:41.000
Boss wants you there.

54:41.000 --> 54:48.000
Nobody's bigger
than you, A.R.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
Seven-card stud.
Let me ask you something.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
You ever dream
about this game?

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
I do... every night...
nightmares.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
I got jacks up.
I'm lookin' at kings up.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
I got four aces.
Oh, sh--

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
I'm looking at a straight flush.
Oh, looky here, looky here.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Looks who's high, huh?
A thousand.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
Come on, come on.
You in or out?
I'm in.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
It's my turn now.
You in or out?

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Are you in?
Huh?

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
Hey!

55:21.000 --> 55:39.000
What's the matter?
Did I make a wrong bet?

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Ohhh!
My number two.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
Sit down
and get wet.

55:47.000 --> 55:52.000
That was a beautiful
wedding, huh?

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
Always makes me
cry like a baby--

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
Young people
madly in love.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
Isn't it funny?

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
I mean, isn't it funny
to hear...

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
things that you
can't believe.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
Like, I've been hearing,
Charlie, you've been
talking to people...

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
about the unions
and all that dogshit,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
horseshit, pigshit!

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
I'm just tryin' to make
money,Joe... for you.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
How come
I ain't heard of it?

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
All the guys
you was talking to...

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
thought you was talking
to them, not me!

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
After all, I am your
number two, right?

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
Holy Christ,
screw 'em.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
We could be bigger than
theJews, bigger than the Irish.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
We could run
the whole fucking country.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
You could be the next
John D. Rockefeller,
if you let me do it for you.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
See,Joe, it's
what I told ya's.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
It's terrible what happened
to Rothstein, isn't it?

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
Yeah, fuckin' terrible.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
He got hit
in his own hotel room.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
It's scary.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
Who, uh--
Who did it and why?

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
Who knows? Gambling debts,
mad-dog killer.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Who knows,
it's--

57:15.000 --> 57:21.000
We're all shook up
around here.

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
You know, Charlie,

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
you're a swell guy.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
But from now on,
you look the wrong way,

57:30.000 --> 57:36.000
you fart in the
wrong direction--

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
Joe, you're always
complainin' I don't eat.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
If I don't eat,
how am I gonna fart, huh?

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
Yeah.

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
He's funny.!

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
Yeah, he's funny.

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
I told ya's, five G's
on Sonny Boy in the fifth,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
five G's on Star
in the sixth.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
Off the phone.
I'm makin' a bet!

58:08.000 --> 58:17.000
Beat it!

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
Charlie,you know
who hit Rothstein.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
You gotta kill him.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
I always said
you was the one, Charlie.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
But if you're gonna
take him down,

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
get a price
from Faranzano.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
I, uh, always thought
your loyalty was toJoe.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
I loveJoe,

58:40.000 --> 58:46.000
but this is business
and Faranzano's gonna win.

58:46.000 --> 58:53.000
And if you do this,
you can write your own ticket.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
How do we set
the meeting?

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
I won't go to Brooklyn.
He won't come here.

58:58.000 --> 59:03.000
Pick a neutral territory.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Staten Island,
Profaci's turf?

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
Perfect!
I'll set it up.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
Okay.

59:12.000 --> 59:23.000
I always knew
you was the one, Charlie.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
It's likeJoe Profaci's
invitin' me into his home.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
Right.
It's like a bar mitzvah.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
Look, if you told me something
because it was Jewish knowledge,

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
I'd say okay. But now
you've gotta say okay.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
This is between Italians.
I've known Profaci 20 years.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
I'm safe on his turf.
When things are
between Italians,

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
one of the Italians
ends up dead.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Relax, Tommy Reina'll be there.
Tommy's my pal.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Will you shut up?
Listen,

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
at least take
Bugsy and I along.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
No, no. I take you guys,
it's a sign of distrust.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
I want Faranzano
to trust me, huh?
Charlie's right.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It's true,
ain't it?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
You changed. You're not
listening to your friends.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Listen to you!
You let Mad Dog Coll live.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
He's already killed Rothstein,
and who knows who's next!

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
You blame me for
A.R.'s death.
I don't blame you.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
So what then?
I make one mistake.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Suddenly you--
you know everything.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Ah.
Hey, you're gettin'
a swelled head.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I see it. I do!

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Meyer, don't ever
point your finger at me.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Oh, excuse me,
Mr. Bigshot!

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Please, Charlie,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I need you alive.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I chose you as
our leader, remember?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Remember that.
You chose me?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
That ain't what I remember.
What I remember is,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
you didn't have it.
I didn't have it?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I didn't have what?
I didn't have the guts?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I didn't have the brains?
Don't make me
say it, okay?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Fuck you. You got
somethin' to say?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Fuck you! You fucking got
something to say to me?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I could've let you
die in the streets.
Come on, say it.!

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
That's your second mistake,
you fuck.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Come on, Charlie.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Meyer, come on.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
All right!
All right!

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Look, you're
brilliant, okay?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
But you ain't Italian.
You don't understand Italians.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Without me,
you don't last two weeks.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Yeah, because I would
screw up some Sicilian!

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yeah. But you
said it yourself.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I got it, whatever it is.
Now I'm gonna use it.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You got it!
You got what?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000
At least I've got the brains
not to make a fatal mistake.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Anna. You care about her.
You married her.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
If you were out front,
she'd get hit.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And as tough as
you say you are,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
you would never recover.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
You see what I'm saying?
Without me,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
you are a loser.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Go on, then, Charlie.
Kill yourself.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Bambino!
It's been too long.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Profaci?
I told him it was
postponed to tomorrow.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
He talks
too much anyway.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
This is just
you and me, huh?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Thanks for setting
this up, Tommy.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
You're a pal.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Charlie,you
understand business.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I'm a business man myself.
I.R.S. came last week.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Eighteen hours,
they found nothing.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
So, strictly business.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I hope you can
appreciate some facts.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Conditions have changed.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Some people have gotten
too powerful.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I'll take care of Masseria.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Personally. I want you
to do it yourself.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
That's not all, though.
Lansky and Siegel.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I know you've always
gotten along,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
butJews,
they're different.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
You cross 'em one time,
fight with 'em one time,
and they're gone.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I know this.
I've heard.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Heard what?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
They're a different
race...Jews.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
You take Communion.
I take Communion.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
They don't even believe in sin,
for Christ's sake.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
They're gonna
betray you,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
just like they
betrayed Jesus Christ.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
You join my family,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
they die.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
No one will even know
you approved.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Looks like I don't have
a choice, do I?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
No.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Either I agree
to, uh,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
kill my friends,
or you kill me.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000
That's right.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I don't accept
the choices.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Charlie, Charlie!

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Tough little bambino.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
He's got balls--
Don't talk to me!

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Rocco.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
What is this loyalty?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Huh?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
We're going to
kill them anyway.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:14.000
All this is for nothing.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Well?
I don't bend over.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
It's too hard
to stand straight again.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Long run, short run,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
you have no choice.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Salvatore-
Don't start.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Tough guy,
isn't he, Tom?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
How ya doin'?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I look beautiful, huh?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
You look like shit.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
It's good to see you
with your eyes open.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Everybody's talkin' about you.
They say it's a miracle.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
First time somebody got taken
for a ride and lived.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
I guess I'm just lucky.
Yeah, lucky.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
That's you,
Lucky Luciano.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
So what aboutJoe?
Masseria.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
He's confused.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
He don't know if you're workin'
for him or Faranzano.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
He's gotta be pissed,
but he ain't lifted a finger.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
He can't figure out why
Faranzano didn't kill you.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
He needs me.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
He can't get close enough
to Masseria to do it himself.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
He wants me to kill him.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
- What's wrong with that?
- Sicilian law, Benny.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Kill a don,
you can't never be a don.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
We have to start a war.
Make those bastards
fight each other.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
The only way to do that
is to kill somebody important.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Have 'em blame it
on each other.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
- Reina.
- Tommy?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Faranzano will think
Masseria ordered the hit
'cause Tommy changed sides.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
The Bronx is at stake.
He'll have to strike back.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
You're talkin' about
a friend of mine, Meyer.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Anybody touches Tommy--

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
No, it's done.
It's not done.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Benny, Reina set me up.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
When he went with Faranzano,
the don made him pay a price--

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
me.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I just don't believe--
I mean, Tommy would never--

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Meyer, from now on,
you and me, we gotta agree.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
So if I start getting
a swelled head,just shoot me.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
It'd be a lot
less painful.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Ahem.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
You guys gotta
get out of here.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Take care of yourself.
See ya, Charlie.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:11.000
See ya later, Frankie.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
When the, uh,
war comes,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
you're gonna be
in danger.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Danger's not for girls?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Maybe you oughta
leave town for a while.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
You don't understand
anything, do you?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I'm with you now.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Okay?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Okay.
Okay.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:09:01.000
You get some sleep.
Yeah.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Benny.
Tommy.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Come here.
How you doin', huh?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
We gotta talk, Tommy.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Where's Short Stick?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
It's his day off.
He's at the dog track.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000
How's Charlie?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Charlie's tough.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Faranzano had no right!
He had no fuckin' right!

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
If I'd have known,
I'd have done something.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
It wasn't your fault.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000
That's why I'm here.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I wanna show you
there's no hard feelings.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I got somethin'.
Take it.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Hey, what's this?
Huh?
Huh?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
This was, I swear to God--

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
a friend of Frankie's
pinched it--

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
the personal property...
of Benito Mussolini.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
- Il Duce.
- Il Duce.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Oh, shit.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It's a nice gun.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:18.000
We've been friends
a long time, huh, Tommy?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
A long time.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Yeah.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
You know what
Charlie always says--

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000
how this is America...
and everything is money.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Yeah, I think I, uh--

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I think I may have
heard that somewheres.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:11:13.000
But this ain't money, Tommy.
This is friendship.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
This is too big to
pay off the goddamn judges.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
It's great that the bosses are
trying to knock each other off,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
but they can't seem
to get the job done.
Take it easy.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Then we'll have to
do it for them.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Masseria?
Yeah.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
There's just
one problem.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
How do we get him
to trust us again?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I know.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:12:08.000
We save his life.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.000
How's it goin',Joe?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
How many times you gonna
fuck me, Charlie?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I got eyes, I see.
I got ears, I hear.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I even got a brain.
Whatever you think,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I've already thought it...
1 0 times over!

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
So then why
suspect me, huh?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Staten Island?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
You were pissed at me,
so I thought,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I'll tell Faranzano
I'm gonna make a deal with him.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
He admits it.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
How else can I set
a meeting with this guy?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
How else can I
get close to him?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
There's one thing
you haven't thought about.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I am going to kill
Faranzano.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
If I live, he dies.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
That's what I went
to Staten Island to do.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Obviously, uh,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:16.000
it didn't work out
as I planned it.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.000
You got 48 hours
to kill him.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Mr. Lucky Luciano!

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
You know, what's great is that
there's no hard feelings.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I-- I'll take you guys
out to dinner tonight.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Where you wanna go?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Anyplace you wanna go.
Anyplace
you wanna go.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I mean, it's on me.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Frankie.!

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
- Where's the car?
- Staten Island.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
You enjoyed Charlie
gettin' tortured, didn't you,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
you fucking shit.
Yeah, but--

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
But you said
all was forgiven.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:41.000
It is.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Come on,Joe.
Get away.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
That's... 1 5 times.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I told you, Charlie,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
they will never kill me.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Never.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:22.000
By the way...
thanks.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Ehi.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Sorry what
I had to do.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Why do they call them
king of beasts?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
They don't hunt.
They don't kill.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
All they do is eat,
shit and fornicate.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Just like some
fat people I know.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Let's talk business.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
The only way I can kill Masseria
is if you lose the war.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Masseria has to think
he's won.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I give you a week.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
One more thing.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Don't ever, ever
touch my friends.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Your lives
will be your own.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Let's go.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Hey! Ha, ha!

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
We did it, huh?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
We did it!

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Aaah!

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
We won!

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I knew we would,Joe.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
So, when do we
wipe out Faranzano?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
This week?
Next week?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Next year.
What's the hurry, huh?
Right.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Let the fucker sweat.
Right.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
It looks good.
Not bad. Wait.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Try this.
Salsiccia.
Mmm.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Tell me something,Joe.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
What do you love, huh?

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000
What do I love?
What kind of question is that?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Conversation while we eat.
What do you love?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I love food.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I love pussy.
You know.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Young pussy.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
But, uh,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
most of all,
I love to destroy people.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Anybody?
The bigger the better.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
But... anybody.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Makes me feel...
good.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you
about your nephew.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
He was a pal of mine.
Your namesake, right?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Yeah. He was a...

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
good kid.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Yeah, he was.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
You forgot this, but I was
there the day he got killed.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
On the street?
Yeah.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
You see,
I've been wonderin'...

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
why'd you kill
your own blood, huh?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Some kind of
family dispute.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I don't remember.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
We're family,
ain't we?

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Yeah.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Family, huh?
Mm-hmm.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I gotta take a leak.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Joe, this ain't number 1 6.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Come on.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
My friends!
Honorable men!

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I welcome you today
as your Caesar.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
The boss of all bosses!

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Capo de tutti capi.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
To give
impartial leadership,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I have turned over my interests
to other members of my family.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
In return, I will receive
a fair share of the proceeds...

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
from all the families
across the country.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.000
From now on, we will be
divided into five families,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and the capo
from each family...

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
will report to me.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Mr. Thomas Gagliano.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Mr.Joseph Bonanno.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Mr.Joseph Profaci.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Mr. Vincent Mangano.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And Mr. Charlie Luciano.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Who will supervise
the entire operation...

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
under my direction.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Now I ask you to come forward
and pay respects,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
not to me,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
but to the office I hold.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Dei gratia et iatalorum...

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:43.000
in volutate.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Grazie.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Grand'onore.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
It's a great privilege,
Don Faranzano.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Excuse us.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Ready for this?
Faranzano brought in Coll...

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
to ice you.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
What?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Know what we
have to do?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Have a good day,
Mr. Coll.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:12.000
You guys are so stupid!

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.000
The problem is...
I don't feel it.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:27.000
All this blood,
I don't feel a thing.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
The way I see it,
we got two problems:

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
getting past his outer
guards and having him
invite us into his office.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I could pay some cop
to kill him.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Give me the money
and I'll do it.
No, no.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Brains,
not brawn.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
This is somethin' we need
to do ourselves.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Pride... that's his weakness.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Don't people say
you look more like a
bookkeeper than a gangster?

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
So, you look like
a second baseman!

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
You see, Faranzano's the only
mug I ever heard brag...

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
about being audited
by the I.R.S.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
He came out clean, so he figures
his shit don't stink. Right?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
His shit don't stink.
So?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Seeing as how he enjoyed
the experience so much,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:42.000
why don't we give it
to him again?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I'm scared.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Huh?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I'm scared.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Everything I want...

01:24:55.000 --> 01:26:05.000
is right here.
All I have to do is take it.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Morning.
Mmm.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Oh,Jesus Christ.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Name it, Frankie.
Anything.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Whatever the department
can do.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
The body
goes out covered.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
So far as the press knows,
it's Charlie.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
You got it.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Hey, Benny.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Those bastards!
They'll pay.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
It's like
you told me, Charlie.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
If you loved her...

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:38.000
it was a mistake.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000
You gotta come out
of it, Charlie.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
This is the moment.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:50.000
This is the test.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:56.000
They're the ones
who made the mistake.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Shut up and
give me the don.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Don, Don, Don.
You got the dough?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000
- Charlie's dead?
- Deep fryin' in hell.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
You want the other three
to join him?

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Come on over.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I'll pay you for this.
Give you instructions.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I'll be over.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Mad Dog Coll's coming over
to get paid.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.000
When he walks in,
put him on ice.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:41.000
My pleasure.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Here's my key. 31 2.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Yes, absolutely.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Mr. Coll, I sent
your room service.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
It must be on its way.
I don't know.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
You don't know if
it's on the way up?

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Coll.
Give it to me again.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I want two eggs up.
I want a rasher of bacon.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I want a pot of coffee, black.
And I want it now!

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
I want a pot of coffee, black.
And I want it now!

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Right now,
or I'll--

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Room service.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
It's about time.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Bring it in.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
What's your handle?
Because...

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I wanna talk to your boss,
that's why.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I just want
your undivided attention.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Son of a bitch!

01:31:49.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Oh, my God.Jesus.!

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I.R.S. raid.
Get goin'.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I said, get lost! Now!

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Anybody else got
any bright ideas?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Now, beat it!

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Nice work, Cliff.
Okay.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Mr. Faranzano?
It's the I.R.S. again.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Show them in.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Don't even
think about it.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Hey, you want it
in the eyeball?

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Drop it!
Heaters on the floor! Now!

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Siegel, drop it.!

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
All right, Lansky,
over there.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:23.000
You too, Costello...
over with your Yid friends.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Ah, this is pretty.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
- Kill 'em!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000
How much is it worth?

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Anything!
Hundred grand!

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
- You don't like yourself much.
- Two hundred!

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Five. Come on, say it! Five!

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
All right, five.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Truth is, I like my work.
I would've done it for nothin'.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Okay, boys.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
That's number three,
Meyer.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
This time I want you
to thank me.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Thank you.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:20.000
No, you crazyJews!

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Remember this?

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Sicilian law,
remember?

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
You kill a don--
All right.
Just do like I said.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Slow.
What are you doing?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Why slowly?
'Cause I tortured you?

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
No, no, no. It's what
you did 1 5 years ago.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Jesus! You want revenge
after 1 5 years?

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I've been busy.
Get up!

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
At least tell me...

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
what I did
1 5 years ago.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
No!
Want me to tell you?

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Wanna know
what you did?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Tell me, what'd I do
1 5 years ago?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
You destroyed my father!

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Your father? I don't
even remember your father!

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Exactly.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Charlie.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:21.000
No, no, please!

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
No.!

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Ahhh!

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Hey, Lucky.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Sit.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I want to thank Mr. Capone
for hosting this meeting.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Sit down and shut up,
will ya?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Hey, there ain't
gonna be a boss.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
You all know
how I got this.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
MaybeJoe Profaci, here--

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Wait a minute.
What're you saying?
Don't worry.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Maybe you knew it was
gonna happen to me,

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
maybe you didn't.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
But by the old way
of doin' things,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000
if I become boss now, I have
to hit you in case you knew.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
And all of you shrug?

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Except some of you
are friends ofJoe's.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000
And one day I might do
something, that, uh,

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
upsets you,
then you'll hit me.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Then you become boss.
My friends, they hate you.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Somebody else becomes boss,
and on, and on, and on.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Know what I call that?
Stupid. Very stupid.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
So, if you ain't doin' it,
who's gonna be--

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Nobody.
We're all bosses here.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
What then, Charlie?
We're gonna vote on everything?

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
That's right.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Everybody here...
is equal.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Corporations have
a board of directors.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.000
So will we.
A commission.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Now, I have friends.
They're not from Palermo,

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
not from Sicily...
they're not even Italians.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
They'reJewish.
And I trust 'em.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Anybody have a problem
with that?

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
You say there's gonna
be no boss, but you're
startin' to talk like one.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I've learned.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Every organization
needs somebody...

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
standin'out front.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Call it a figurehead,
a leader,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
whatever.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000
It doesn't much matter
to me who does it.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I say we make Charlie Luciano
head of our national commission.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Who agrees?

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
You want it, Al?
It's yours.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Hell, no.
I want you to do it.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
It's justJulius Caesar
never took no vote.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:32.000
That's why Caesar ended up
dead in the street.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Any other business?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Hey, friendship.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Friendship.
Friendship.
