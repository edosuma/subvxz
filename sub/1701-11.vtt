WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:05.129
Okay, here's his diaper bag...

00:05.630 --> 00:08.632
- ...and his, uh, Mr. Winky. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.925
And, uh...

00:10.093 --> 00:11.218
Oh.

00:11.386 --> 00:12.428
Him. Hi!

00:13.680 --> 00:15.764
- How did everything go?
- Great.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.142
There was a projectile, uh...

00:18.685 --> 00:21.270
...throwing up incident,
but he started it.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.480
- Ha, ha. We've gotta go.
- Okay.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.900
Oh, right. Um...

00:27.068 --> 00:29.528
I've got some news. It's about us.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.823
- Oh, you and me?
- Uh, no. Susan and me.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.700
The other "us."

00:35.660 --> 00:36.702
Okay.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.706
We're getting married.

00:46.379 --> 00:50.007
As in, "I now pronounce you
wife and wife" married?

00:50.967 --> 00:54.511
We'd like you to come.
We understand if you don't want to.

00:54.763 --> 00:58.849
Why wouldn't I want to come?
I had fun at the first wedding.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.351
I just thought that...

01:01.603 --> 01:06.106
Why shouldn't I be happy for you?
What would it say about me...

01:06.316 --> 01:09.318
...if I couldn't, uh, revel in your joy?

01:09.569 --> 01:12.029
And I'm reveling, baby. Believe me.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.740
Is your finger caught in that chair?

01:15.658 --> 01:16.700
Mm-hm.

01:16.951 --> 01:19.286
- Want us to go?
- Uh-huh.

02:07.293 --> 02:10.211
You're clearly
bothered by something. Tell me what it is.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.840
This is cool.
You're actually on television.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.342
I know.
It really hit me last night.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.511
I'm on Days of our Lives.

02:19.347 --> 02:24.101
Then I started thinking about us,
and how these are the days of our lives.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.647
- Yes!
- What?

02:28.898 --> 02:31.942
Carol and Susan's caterer
had a bike accident...

02:32.152 --> 02:34.278
...and she's in a full-body cast.

02:35.446 --> 02:36.780
Yes!

02:38.074 --> 02:41.034
They asked me, which is cool
since I've never catered...

02:41.244 --> 02:43.662
...and I need the money.
Is this a problem?

02:43.913 --> 02:45.998
- Would it matter?
- You're so great!

02:46.207 --> 02:47.457
Thank you!

02:47.667 --> 02:50.169
- You're really not going?
- I'm really not.

02:50.420 --> 02:54.131
They already live together.
Why do they need to get married?

02:54.465 --> 02:55.966
They love each other.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.720
They wanna celebrate that love
with the people close to them.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.639
If you wanna call that a reason.

03:03.766 --> 03:07.019
Who's the bitterest man
In the living room?

03:07.854 --> 03:10.189
The bitterest man
In the living room?

03:11.733 --> 03:12.774
Hi, neighbor.

03:15.236 --> 03:19.364
- I thought you were over this.
- That has nothing to do with it.

03:19.574 --> 03:23.202
If she were marrying a guy,
you wouldn't expect me to go.

03:23.411 --> 03:27.206
If she were marrying a guy,
she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.585
Did I miss it?

03:31.794 --> 03:34.963
No, I'm on right after this guy
shoots himself.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.257
Whoa, she's pretty.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.509
And she's really nice.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.638
She taught me about
how to work with the cameras...

03:42.847 --> 03:44.723
...and smell-the-fart acting.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.603
- I'm sorry, what?
- Excuse me?

03:50.396 --> 03:53.565
You got so many lines
to learn so fast that sometimes...

03:53.816 --> 03:56.693
...you need a minute
to remember your next one.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.612
So while you're thinking...

03:58.821 --> 04:02.282
...you take this big pause
where you look all intense.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.533
Like this:

04:07.413 --> 04:08.747
- Oh.
- Okay.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.501
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

04:15.338 --> 04:16.922
- Mrs. Wallace?
- Yes.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.632
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray,
your sister's neurosurgeon.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.969
Is she going to be all right?

04:22.178 --> 04:26.056
I'm afraid the situation
is much more dire than we'd expected.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.558
Your sister's suffering from a...

04:34.440 --> 04:36.483
...subcranial hematoma.

04:38.361 --> 04:42.239
Perhaps we can
discuss this further over coffee.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.454
Nice!

04:51.040 --> 04:54.626
For a minute, I thought you were
actually smelling something.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.839
- Do it again!
- All right!

04:59.048 --> 05:01.300
- That was so good!
- Do it again.

05:02.218 --> 05:05.053
"Damn it, Braverman!
It's right there on the chart!"

05:06.681 --> 05:10.642
I gotta get to work.
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

05:10.852 --> 05:11.893
No, that's me.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.395
Oh, right.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.107
- Oh.
- Oh.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.568
Oh, thanks. Couldn't, uh...

05:22.572 --> 05:23.697
Is everything okay?

05:23.906 --> 05:27.868
Um, no. Uh-uh. Um...

05:28.036 --> 05:31.371
One of my clients died
on the massage table today.

05:31.622 --> 05:32.998
Oh, my God.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.543
That's a little more relaxed
than you want them to get.

05:36.711 --> 05:37.753
Yeah, uh-huh.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.715
Um, she was, you know,
82 years old...

05:42.133 --> 05:45.260
...and her name was, um,
Mrs. Adelman.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.470
Oh, honey.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.139
It's just so strange. You know...

05:49.349 --> 05:52.059
...she probably woke up
this morning and thought...

05:52.268 --> 05:55.979
...I'll have some breakfast,
take a walk, then have my massage.

05:56.230 --> 05:59.399
Little did she know God thought,
"Okay, but that's it."

06:03.112 --> 06:05.906
Oh, but the weirdest thing was...

06:06.115 --> 06:09.326
...I was cleansing her aura
when it happened.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.245
And when her spirit
left her body...

06:12.455 --> 06:14.664
...I don't think it went very far.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.750
What do you mean?

06:17.710 --> 06:20.045
I think it went into me.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.097
This is so hard.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.391
I can't decide
between lamb or duck.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.267
Well, lambs are scarier.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.854
Or the movie would've been called
Silence of the Ducks.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.024
Okay, who ordered what?

06:41.275 --> 06:45.570
I had the half-drunk cappuccino
with the lipstick on the rim.

06:46.155 --> 06:49.449
And this with the cigarette
butt in it, is that decaf?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.284
Oh, God.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.620
You're so uptight
about your mom coming.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.124
I know. I just don't want
her to think that because...

06:57.333 --> 06:59.876
...I didn't marry Barry
my life is crap.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.921
Talk about crap,
just listen to Stella Neidman...

07:03.131 --> 07:06.425
...tell her story about Rod Steiger
for the hundredth time.

07:10.179 --> 07:14.808
Uh, Pheebs? How long do you think
this lady will be with us?

07:15.059 --> 07:18.520
I don't know. She obviously
has some unfinished business.

07:18.729 --> 07:19.771
Sit up!

07:23.151 --> 07:24.317
There she is!

07:24.527 --> 07:26.319
- Mom!
- Hey, sweetie!

07:32.535 --> 07:35.162
So this is where you work!

07:35.371 --> 07:37.539
Oh, it's wonderful!

07:37.790 --> 07:41.751
Is it a living room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.004
I guess that's the fun.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.256
Pretty much.
Here, meet my friends.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.342
Monica! You look gorgeous!

07:49.552 --> 07:53.847
Oh, my! The last time I saw you,
it was eat or be eaten.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.266
Uh, this is Joey.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.559
This is Phoebe.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.019
This is Chandler.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.353
You remember Ross?

08:00.563 --> 08:02.772
- Oh, hello, Ross.
- Hi, Mrs. Green.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.445
What do you think of my
daughter, in the apron...

08:08.654 --> 08:09.821
...with the big job!

08:10.198 --> 08:11.448
Oh, Mom!

08:12.825 --> 08:17.537
If you didn't pour the coffee,
no one would have anything to drink.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.457
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.921
This is just so exciting!
You know, I never worked.

08:26.172 --> 08:29.424
I went from my father's house
to the sorority house...

08:29.634 --> 08:33.345
...to my husband's house.
I am just so proud of you!

08:33.554 --> 08:35.054
Really?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.557
I know who you remind me of.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.308
Evelyn Durmer.

08:39.519 --> 08:44.439
That's before the lousy face-lift.
Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.529
Pheebs? Ha, ha. Who's Evelyn Durmer?

08:51.781 --> 08:54.241
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?

08:56.869 --> 08:57.911
Oh, my God!

08:58.496 --> 09:01.748
There's an unattractive
nude man playing the cello.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.253
Just be glad he's not playing
a smaller instrument.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.592
You have some life here, sweetie!

09:12.802 --> 09:16.304
Mom, I realize you were upset
when I didn't marry Barry...

09:16.514 --> 09:20.100
...and get the house in the suburbs
with all the security.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.394
This is just
so much better for me.

09:22.645 --> 09:26.565
I know.
You didn't love Barry, honey.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.317
And I've never seen you this happy.

09:29.527 --> 09:33.071
I look at you and I think,
"This is what I want."

09:35.199 --> 09:36.866
For me.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.203
Well, not just for you.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.538
What do you mean?

09:42.707 --> 09:46.793
I'm, uh, considering leaving your father.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.048
All right, tell me
if this is too cute.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.135
Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.

09:59.181 --> 10:02.267
Oh, God. I think I'm gonna be sick.

10:02.518 --> 10:05.979
What? It's not like I'm putting
little nipples on them.

10:09.817 --> 10:12.360
- You had no idea?
- None.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.070
They didn't fight?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.990
No, they didn't even
talk to each other.

10:17.199 --> 10:20.243
How was I suppose to know
they were having problems?

10:21.537 --> 10:24.331
You know, in my day,
divorce was not an option.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.417
Hey, look who's up!

10:30.254 --> 10:32.881
I just can't believe this is happening.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.800
When I was little,
all parents got divorced.

10:36.010 --> 10:39.137
I figured as an adult,
I wouldn't have to worry about it.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.265
Can't you look at this as flattering?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.517
She just wants to be like you.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.896
Well, couldn't she have just
copied my haircut?

10:49.231 --> 10:52.108
When my parents divorced,
they sent me to a shrink...

10:52.318 --> 10:55.403
...and she told me
that kids blame themselves.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.323
But in your case,
it's actually kind of true.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.575
Oh, that's him.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.621
Damn. My mail-order
grandfather hasn't come yet.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.540
- Phoebe?
- Hi, Mr. Adelman.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.709
- Nice to see you.
- Thanks for coming.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.546
That's okay. Although you did
cut into my busy day of sitting.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.300
Um, do you wanna sit?

11:17.551 --> 11:20.428
No, I spent most of my morning
trying to stand up.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.808
What can I do for you, my dear?

11:25.059 --> 11:28.186
Okay, I don't know how
to say this, but, um...

11:28.396 --> 11:31.147
...I think when your wife's spirit
left her body...

11:31.357 --> 11:33.775
...it, um, kind of stuck around...

11:33.943 --> 11:34.984
...in me.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.946
You're saying my wife is in you?

11:38.197 --> 11:41.282
Yeah. You don't have to
believe me, but...

11:41.492 --> 11:44.786
...um, can you think of
any unfinished business she had?

11:44.995 --> 11:46.955
Any reason to hang around?

11:47.206 --> 11:48.832
I don't know what to say.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.334
All I can think of is that...

11:51.544 --> 11:55.505
...she used to say that before she died,
she wanted to see everything.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.174
- Everything?
- Everything.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.301
Whoa. That's a lot of stuff.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.636
Oh, wait, I...

12:01.846 --> 12:05.807
I remember she also said she wanted
to sleep with me one last time.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.986
I'm sorry.
There's laughing in my head.

12:20.489 --> 12:21.948
Worth a shot, huh?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.372
Ha, ha. Look at this.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.542
These are all Halloween,
three years ago.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.878
Oh, and look, here's Barry.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.172
He came straight from the office?

12:37.423 --> 12:39.883
Oh, no. That was his costume.

12:41.343 --> 12:46.139
See, he's actually an orthodontist,
but he came as a regular dentist.

12:46.849 --> 12:47.891
Um, you guys?

12:48.184 --> 12:51.060
Remember when I said
that I don't need your help?

12:51.479 --> 12:52.979
Actually, I think you said:

12:53.189 --> 12:55.732
"Don't touch that
and get out of my kitchen."

12:56.525 --> 12:58.943
Really? Weird. Anyway...

13:00.070 --> 13:02.614
I planned really well.
I planned and planned.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.742
I just didn't plan enough time to do it.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.828
- You want some help?
- If you want.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.458
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:13.751 --> 13:14.959
What a day.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.878
I took her everywhere.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.884
The Museum of Modern Art,
Rockefeller Center...

13:23.093 --> 13:24.594
...the Statue of Liberty.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.095
She's still with you?

13:26.305 --> 13:30.141
Yes. I guess she hasn't
seen everything yet.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.103
Be right back. She has to go
to the bathroom again.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.691
Such a pretty face!

13:42.279 --> 13:45.782
Oh, this is so much fun.
Just the girls.

13:45.991 --> 13:49.702
Do you know what we should do?
Does anybody have any marijuana?

13:49.870 --> 13:50.912
God!

13:54.124 --> 13:57.293
Look, no one's smoking pot
around all this food.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.337
Well, that's fine.

13:59.588 --> 14:02.465
I never did it. I just thought I might.

14:04.510 --> 14:10.473
What's new in sex?

14:10.683 --> 14:13.142
The only man I've been with
is your father.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.229
I'm dicing. I'm dicing.
I don't hear anything.

14:16.814 --> 14:20.191
This is no offense to your dad,
but I was thinking...

14:20.401 --> 14:21.651
...there might be more.

14:21.902 --> 14:25.238
You know what? I cannot
have this conversation with you.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.447
All right.

14:26.615 --> 14:30.660
You come here and drop this bomb on me
before you even tell Daddy.

14:30.911 --> 14:34.497
Do you want my blessing?
Want me to talk you out of it?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.124
Then what do you want?

14:36.333 --> 14:38.668
I guess I figured
you would understand.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.337
Why on earth
would I understand this?

14:42.715 --> 14:45.258
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.385
But I married mine.

14:49.388 --> 14:50.680
Oh.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.770
We're in trouble. We've only got
12 hours and 36 minutes left.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.689
Move, move, move!

15:00.232 --> 15:03.109
I feel like you should
have German subtitles.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.738
Joey, speed it up!

15:06.989 --> 15:10.867
I'm sorry! It's the pigs!
They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

15:12.202 --> 15:15.455
How did this happen?
I thought you had this planned out.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.749
Do you want me to cry?

15:18.876 --> 15:20.793
Is that what you want?

15:21.003 --> 15:22.879
Do you wanna see me cry?

15:23.464 --> 15:24.505
Sir, no, sir!

15:28.218 --> 15:29.260
All right, you!

15:29.511 --> 15:33.222
No. Look, I told you,
I am not a part of this thing.

15:33.432 --> 15:37.810
Look, Ross. I know you have issues with
Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.105
But if you don't help,
I'm gonna take those hot dogs...

15:41.315 --> 15:44.233
...and create an appetizer
called "Pigs In Ross."

15:45.402 --> 15:46.819
All right, ball a melon!

15:47.029 --> 15:50.156
How come I'm stuck dicing
when he gets to ball a melon?

15:55.537 --> 15:58.206
- How's it going?
- Great! Right on schedule.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.666
Got my happy helpers.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.878
That's fine. Whatever.

16:04.838 --> 16:05.880
What's wrong?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.090
Nothing.

16:08.676 --> 16:12.387
Okay, everything.
I think we're calling off the wedding.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.723
You're still gonna pay me, right?

16:17.601 --> 16:20.228
Or something a little less selfish.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.397
What's the matter? What happened?

16:22.606 --> 16:25.525
My parents called to say
they weren't coming.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.529
I knew they were
having trouble with this, but...

16:29.738 --> 16:33.241
...they're my parents.
They're supposed to give me away.

16:34.284 --> 16:38.079
Susan and I fought because
I said maybe we should call it off.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.290
She said, "This isn't for them.
It's for us."

16:41.500 --> 16:44.919
And if I couldn't see that,
we should cancel the wedding.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.088
I don't know what to do.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.969
I, uh, can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I think Susan's right.

16:53.762 --> 16:54.804
You do?

16:55.764 --> 16:59.809
Do you love her? And don't be
too emphatic about this.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.062
Of course I do.

17:03.313 --> 17:04.896
Well then, that's it.

17:05.107 --> 17:09.234
If George and Adelaide can't
accept that, then the hell with them.

17:10.820 --> 17:13.573
If my parents didn't want me
to marry you...

17:13.781 --> 17:15.742
...no way that would've stopped me.

17:17.493 --> 17:18.994
Look, this is your wedding.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.079
Do it.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.419
You're right. Of course you're right.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.003
So we're back on?

17:28.589 --> 17:29.756
We're back on.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.884
You heard the woman!
Peel! Chop! Devil!

17:34.970 --> 17:37.263
Can't believe I lost two minutes.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.609
It just seems so futile.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.529
You know?
All these women, and nothing!

17:56.116 --> 17:59.452
I feel like Superman
without my powers, you know?

18:00.370 --> 18:03.956
I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.587
Well, now you understand
how I feel every single day.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.050
The world is my lesbian wedding.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.562
Butterscotch?

18:27.898 --> 18:29.190
No one?

18:29.441 --> 18:32.110
All right, you'll be sorry later.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.453
Aw.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.604
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.276
Ross.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.116
Nothing makes God happier...

19:20.325 --> 19:24.078
...than when two people, any two people,
come together in love.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.748
Friends, family,
we're gathered here today...

19:27.958 --> 19:30.543
...to join Carol and Susan
in holy matrimony.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.128
Oh, my God.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.672
Now I've seen everything!

19:38.093 --> 19:39.510
Whoa, she's gone.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.929
She's gone.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.682
Go ahead, get married. Go, go!

19:48.604 --> 19:51.939
Strangers in the night
Exchanging glances

19:52.107 --> 19:53.941
Wondering in the night

19:54.109 --> 19:55.484
Would you look at them?

19:55.736 --> 19:58.112
Yeah. Can't help but.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.579
How's that pig-in-the-blanket
working out for you?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.707
I wrapped those bad boys.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.669
- I miss Rose.
- Oh, yeah?

20:13.879 --> 20:18.716
I know it's kind of weird,
but she was a big part of my life...

20:18.967 --> 20:20.676
I don't know, I feel alone.

20:21.470 --> 20:26.307
You know, I, uh, couldn't help
overhearing what you just said.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.604
I think it's time you forget about Rose,
move on with your life.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.522
How about we get you a drink?

20:33.732 --> 20:35.483
Okay. So nice!

20:43.659 --> 20:46.619
I shouldn't even bother
coming up with a line, right?

20:49.623 --> 20:51.249
Hey, Mom, having fun?

20:51.500 --> 20:56.212
Am I! I just danced
with a wonderfully large woman.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.549
And three other girls
made eyes at me over at the buffet.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.344
I'm not saying
it's something I wanna pursue...

21:03.595 --> 21:05.805
...but it's nice to know I have options.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.810
Ahem, there's more alcohol, right?

21:15.691 --> 21:17.066
How you doing?

21:17.985 --> 21:19.151
Okay.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.905
You did a good thing today.

21:27.828 --> 21:28.869
You wanna dance?

21:29.454 --> 21:31.247
No, that's fine.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.207
Come on.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.626
I'll let you lead.

21:39.631 --> 21:40.798
Okay.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.896
Look, penis, schmenis!

21:56.148 --> 21:57.940
Okay? We're all people.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.996
Which one of us is gonna be
the first one to get married?

22:12.497 --> 22:14.123
Mon, I was married.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.209
- Yeah, me too, technically.
- I had a wedding.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.837
Just trying to start a discussion.

22:20.630 --> 22:24.258
Which one do you think
will be the last to get married?

22:28.805 --> 22:30.139
Isn't Ben in this?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.224
- Of course!
- Absolutely.
