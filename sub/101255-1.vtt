The history
of the Civil War

01:21.255 --> 01:24.432
was written by white men
to serve their own agenda.

01:24.475 --> 01:28.000
It's time for a black man
to tell his own story.

01:28.044 --> 01:32.483
This is my father's story, told the only way I know how.

01:32.527 --> 01:35.312
The legend of Emperor.

02:15.047 --> 02:17.267
You sure
there's enough men?It's enough.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.226
We have 23
well-armed men.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.010
They only have
a few guards.

02:22.054 --> 02:23.665
Once we get
inside the gates,

02:23.708 --> 02:25.623
we won't have any trouble
overpowering them.

02:26.711 --> 02:29.366
After that, it's just
a matter of time.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.716
The slaves will rebel
and they will join us.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.068
What if they don't come?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.201
Have faith, son.

04:19.781 --> 04:22.784
You aren't a slave.

04:24.742 --> 04:27.136
You are a prince
of a people

04:27.179 --> 04:30.618
who come from
a faraway place.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.578
Your grandpa was a king.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.930
And you will be a king.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.672
An emperor.

04:43.718 --> 04:47.069
Nothing will dent
your will.

04:48.549 --> 04:51.160
That's why
I named you Shields.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.425

There you are.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.103

Don't thank me.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.019

06:44.839 --> 06:46.275
Where are you going?

06:49.496 --> 06:51.193
Every night,
you go out gambling

[woman] How are we going
to pay for any seed
without any money?

07:34.584 --> 07:37.239
Duvane, we are in trouble,
and if you don't
stop gambling,

07:37.282 --> 07:39.023
we are going
to lose everything.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.373

It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

Master Duvane.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.177
What now?

08:48.745 --> 08:51.531
That man keep gamblin'
the way he is,

08:51.574 --> 08:52.967
we ain't gonna have
nothin' to plant.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.536
Why you worry so much?
It ain't your money.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.538
I worry about us.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.757
You can worry
all you want to.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.194
Ain't nothin' gonna change.

09:03.238 --> 09:06.197
That man is just a fool.

09:07.285 --> 09:08.635
Good night, y'all.

Good night, Aunt Betty.

09:13.378 --> 09:16.033

09:26.435 --> 09:28.350
Every time
he steals a book--

09:28.393 --> 09:31.396
Every time he steals a book,
it's another chance
to get caught.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.615
He ain't stealin',
he borrowin'.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.008
It's too risky.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.575
Master Duvane
don't care none.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.622
When we go up north,
I want that boy
to be able to read.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.260
Not so fast.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.140
I need you to lend me
some more money.

10:19.183 --> 10:22.099
Your plantation
ain't hardly worth

10:22.143 --> 10:23.840
what you've already
borrowed from me.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.842
Please. You know it is.

10:25.886 --> 10:29.541
It ain't. Between Lincoln
and this abolition talk...

10:30.542 --> 10:33.241
plantation values
are dropping off.

10:33.284 --> 10:36.592

that don't have a slave

Well, boy, your
organizing days are over.

Come tomorrow, you gonna be

What do you want?

13:18.406 --> 13:20.582

13:20.625 --> 13:22.366
Now, in order to get
any work done tomorrow,

13:22.410 --> 13:25.456
we need to get some,
first thing in the morning.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.198
How much seed do we need?

13:28.242 --> 13:30.244
We need about
three pound of seed
per acre.

13:30.287 --> 13:31.941
How many acres
need planting?

13:32.681 --> 13:33.725
About a third.

This all the seed we got?

14:20.294 --> 14:22.252
Shields, is it?

14:22.296 --> 14:25.690
Damn nigger told me
the wrong amount of seed
to get at the store.

14:25.734 --> 14:29.172
Hank tells me that
we gonna be losing almost

14:29.216 --> 14:31.609
a whole half a day's worth
of work because of you.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.396
Don't wanna work,
you ask me.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.703
Shields, how long
you been working here?

14:40.009 --> 14:41.402
Since I was a boy.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.973
-And how long you been
helping order the seed?
-Long time.

14:47.016 --> 14:49.584
So it's not likely
you gonna get it wrong?

14:49.627 --> 14:50.846
No, sir.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.981
I think Master Hank
might have...

14:55.024 --> 14:56.634
got a little confused
is all.

14:58.506 --> 15:01.465
Yeah, but you ain't
calling Mr. Hank a liar.

15:04.686 --> 15:08.255
Well, we want to set
a good example here.

That boy of yours is
a little troublemaker.

21:00.084 --> 21:01.782
[laughing]

21:04.350 --> 21:07.353
Maybe next time,
his daddy should do
the disciplining.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.268
I almost sprained
my wrist.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.618

[Grady chuckling]

21:13.750 --> 21:15.839
You're liable to
get yourself killed.

Come on. Come on.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.326

21:33.248 --> 21:35.206

21:37.078 --> 21:39.646
'Cause this
is God's country,
that's why.

21:39.689 --> 21:43.084
We white folks,
we made in his image.

21:44.564 --> 21:47.175
And in God's country,

21:47.218 --> 21:50.396

22:22.776 --> 22:25.169

27:27.080 --> 27:28.342
Come on out now.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.521
Hiding back there
ain't gonna do you
much good.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.701
Hand over that body
and we won't shoot.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.008
What y'all want
with a dead body?

27:42.051 --> 27:45.185
That's our brother,
and we want to give him
a proper burial.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.578
Be a shame to bury him.

27:48.492 --> 27:50.233
He's worth $200.

27:54.237 --> 27:55.891
He's worth $200?

27:55.935 --> 27:58.241
Heck, we should think about
turning him in ourselves.

27:58.285 --> 28:01.941
-What's wrong with you, Sam?
That's our baby brother.
-I'm just saying.

28:01.984 --> 28:03.986
What difference
does it make?
He's dead as a doornail.

28:04.030 --> 28:06.162
What if Ma
heard you right now?

28:06.206 --> 28:09.252
How can you think
about money
at a time like this?

28:09.296 --> 28:10.732
'Cause we ain't got none.

28:10.776 --> 28:11.777
[gun cocks]

28:14.214 --> 28:17.783
What'd you kill him for?
He wasn't worth nothin'.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.567
I tell you what.

28:20.829 --> 28:23.963
I'll give you
the same chance
I gave your brother.

28:24.006 --> 28:27.053
Now, either you can fire
that there rifle...

28:28.228 --> 28:29.403
or you can run.

28:42.982 --> 28:44.157
[grunts]

28:52.818 --> 28:54.515

29:14.796 --> 29:17.190
[horse whinnies]

29:17.233 --> 29:19.801
[Grady]
As for me, you know,

29:19.845 --> 29:22.064
hell, I can go
get a job anywhere.

29:22.108 --> 29:24.980
This ain't my first time
doing this.
You know what I'm saying?

29:29.985 --> 29:34.120
I just couldn't believe it.
I couldn't believe they
let him get away like that.

29:35.382 --> 29:38.864
If I'd been there,
whole different story.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.310
Now, you take this bunch
right here. Look at 'em.

29:50.353 --> 29:54.880
In line, stepping along,
keeping the rows.

29:56.011 --> 29:58.405
If I'd been there
and that nigger went crazy,

29:58.448 --> 30:01.495
Beaumont would still be alive
and that nigger'd be dead.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.606

30:32.265 --> 30:34.310
[panting]

30:43.624 --> 30:45.756
[bird call]

30:52.198 --> 30:55.636
[man] Just don't know
if he got this far.

30:55.679 --> 30:59.248
He could've made down
to the Ashley River.

30:59.292 --> 31:01.729
[conversation continues,
faint]

31:04.514 --> 31:08.388
He couldn't get
quite as far on foot.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.304
[gasps]

31:11.347 --> 31:13.741
Turn around.
We've been here.

31:13.784 --> 31:15.395
Might be something
over there.

31:25.579 --> 31:29.496
Things here open up,
gonna be able to see him
if he's down there.

31:58.177 --> 31:59.482
Hey, come on.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.040
You don't talk much,
do you?

32:38.565 --> 32:40.132
They cut your tongue?

32:42.177 --> 32:43.439
What for?

32:48.967 --> 32:50.490
Talk too much.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.364
You've been
hidin' out here?

32:57.801 --> 32:59.151
This the Hellhole Swamp?

33:01.544 --> 33:03.242
I heard about this place.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.593
They say a lot of runaway
live out here.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.263
[sighs]

33:33.968 --> 33:35.970
I can't stay here.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.017
I gotta get north.

33:40.409 --> 33:42.542
It's the only way
I can free my son.

33:46.328 --> 33:49.027
You know about
the Underground Railroad?

34:18.534 --> 34:21.581
[hoofbeats]

34:46.606 --> 34:48.085
[horse whinnies]

34:58.835 --> 35:01.882
You ain't out there
to rob me, I ain't liable
to hurt you, neither.

35:12.371 --> 35:13.415
Hello, sir.

35:15.765 --> 35:19.073
I was, uh,
headed to Greensboro.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.338
I was wondering
if you could point me
in the right direction.

35:23.382 --> 35:25.601
What business you got
in Greensboro?

35:26.036 --> 35:27.125
My own.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.171
Can you help me or not?

35:32.347 --> 35:34.175
You the one
them white folks
is looking for.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.916
No, sir.

35:35.959 --> 35:39.049
You must've
got me confused
with somebody else.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.008
No, I don't neither.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.357
No, you's him.

35:43.837 --> 35:47.362
Yeah, but don't you worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.190
Everybody talking
'bout you.

35:51.061 --> 35:52.846
Yeah.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.631
But if you come with me,
I can help you find a place

35:55.675 --> 35:59.809
to hide out
and lay your head down
for a night or two.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.768
Also get some food
in your belly

36:01.811 --> 36:04.118
'fore you head on
to Greensboro--
that's a long way.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.467
What about your master?

36:05.511 --> 36:09.645
Oh, he-- he away
with family out west.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.778
You'll be gone before
anybody know a thing.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.782
Why is you offering
to help me?

36:19.481 --> 36:22.049
I like what you doing.

36:22.092 --> 36:24.617
I'd do it myself
if I was younger.

36:26.053 --> 36:29.056
It'd just be nice
if you could live through it.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.103
Name's Shields.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.236
I know who you is.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.326

36:38.370 --> 36:40.328

36:42.200 --> 36:44.202
Truesdale, they call me.

36:45.464 --> 36:46.595
[chuckles]

36:47.292 --> 36:48.641
Come on, Jay.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.995
Who's that?

37:39.039 --> 37:41.476
[Truesdale]
Who does it look like?I don't know.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.957
I don't want to know.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.525
That's the fella
everybody been
talking about.

37:46.568 --> 37:48.135
The one that killed
them white folks?

37:48.918 --> 37:49.919
[Truesdale] Yeah.

37:51.356 --> 37:52.966
What'd you bring him
here for?

37:53.009 --> 37:55.621
So he can rest for a minute
'fore he go on his way.

37:55.664 --> 37:59.494
This ain't a hotel.
Anyone find out about this,
we gonna be in trouble.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.801
Nobody saw us.
Everybody gone.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.630
You gotta go.
You can't stay here.

38:04.673 --> 38:06.414
Now, Delores,

38:06.458 --> 38:08.068
now, if you don't
let him be,

38:08.111 --> 38:09.983
I might have to tell
Master Reed

38:10.026 --> 38:13.073
about you sneakin' them sweets
out the kitchen every evenin'.

38:13.116 --> 38:15.815
That candy ain't nothin'
compared to this.

38:15.858 --> 38:17.860
Yeah, but it's enough
to get you some lashes

38:17.904 --> 38:20.298
and you know
you ain't got the stomach
for no whuppin'.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.185
[chuckling]

38:38.228 --> 38:40.056
Ain't no good gonna
come out of this.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.929
Oh, hush. Go in there
and fix our guest a bath.

38:42.972 --> 38:44.757
Ain't you got no manners?

38:44.800 --> 38:46.324
[chuckling]

38:47.368 --> 38:49.370
Go on with you.

39:00.903 --> 39:02.078
So...

39:03.515 --> 39:04.951
true what they say?

39:07.693 --> 39:09.172
What'd they say?

39:09.216 --> 39:11.827
Say you killed
a bunch of white folk.

39:11.871 --> 39:12.959
What's it matter?

39:14.090 --> 39:15.265
It's a sin.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.573
God gonna punish you.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.446
Way I see it,

39:21.489 --> 39:24.057
God done punish me
for things I ain't even done.

39:27.277 --> 39:28.496
Why you do it?

39:29.541 --> 39:31.151
They beat my son.

39:32.239 --> 39:34.241
You killed a white man
over that?

39:35.285 --> 39:36.809
That happen every day.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.946
I took lashes
my whole life.

39:46.427 --> 39:47.733
Kept my head down.

39:50.562 --> 39:52.172
Didn't cause no trouble.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.396
Thought that'd keep
my family safe.

40:03.575 --> 40:06.012
But when I seen
what they did to Tommy...

40:07.840 --> 40:10.233
when I seen the life
ahead of him...

40:17.937 --> 40:20.243
I don't want him
to be like me.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.731
-You's a brave man.
-No.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.082
I'm a fool.

40:37.391 --> 40:39.001
I didn't think.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.223
I just went crazy.

40:45.747 --> 40:48.446
Because of me,

40:56.192 --> 40:57.890

41:21.870 --> 41:23.350
Sorry.

41:25.744 --> 41:27.746
I shouldn't
have judged you.

41:28.529 --> 41:30.183
It's all right.

41:39.105 --> 41:40.759
Anything else you need?

41:47.417 --> 41:48.549

42:56.748 --> 42:58.358
Don't thank me yet.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.928
You worth too much money
to just let you walk away.

43:02.971 --> 43:06.584
Now, you and me

and wait for your master.

43:08.237 --> 43:09.978
Get on over here.

43:10.022 --> 43:11.893
Get on over here
and open up this cage.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.902
I hate to do this to you.

43:20.946 --> 43:24.602
That reward money for you
is gonna buy me my freedom.

43:25.733 --> 43:27.605
Go on, get up in there
with them pigs.

43:27.648 --> 43:30.085

They gonna be here any minute.

44:16.262 --> 44:19.134
-Tell 'em
I killed Truesdale.
-What? No.

44:19.178 --> 44:20.745
Hey, listen to me, now.
Come on.

44:20.788 --> 44:22.660
One more body
make no difference.

44:22.703 --> 44:25.140
They think you did this,
they gonna hang you
for sure.

44:26.228 --> 44:29.318
Take Truesdale's horse.
Go on, now, go.

44:31.233 --> 44:32.408
Thank you.

44:49.512 --> 44:51.427
Randolph's
murderous nigger

44:51.471 --> 44:53.778
is just a symptom
of a larger problem.

44:53.821 --> 44:57.172
You're damn right.
This is liable to
lead to a rebellion.

44:57.216 --> 45:00.262
That's just what we need
with all this
abolition talk up north.

45:00.306 --> 45:04.049
Do you think folks in Boston
care any more about slaves
than we do?

45:04.092 --> 45:06.965
They just need labor
for their factories.

45:07.008 --> 45:09.663
Why don't you kill his boy?
That'd set a good example.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.360
I've already lost
one slave.

45:11.404 --> 45:14.842
I'm not destroying
any more of my property.

45:14.886 --> 45:17.627
You all may be
in the business
of casting blame,

45:17.671 --> 45:21.501
but I am in the business
of finding solutions.

45:22.371 --> 45:23.851
Sir, step in, please.

45:28.987 --> 45:32.817
Gentlemen, Adel,
Mr. Luke McCabe,

45:32.860 --> 45:35.515
the best bounty hunter
in the state of Texas.

45:35.558 --> 45:38.126
Heard you got a problem
with a runaway slave.

45:38.170 --> 45:40.172
This nigger is rampaging
the countryside,

45:40.215 --> 45:42.609
stealing from,
raping and killing
good God-fearing white folks

45:42.652 --> 45:44.350
like it ain't nothing!

45:44.393 --> 45:46.918
Tom, show him
the poster, please.

45:59.408 --> 46:00.932
$1,000.

46:00.975 --> 46:03.021
A thousand dollars?
[scoffs]

46:03.064 --> 46:05.414
That's more than twice
what he's worth.

46:05.458 --> 46:09.767
Well, the way I figure,
it's not about one slave.

46:10.724 --> 46:12.639
The longer he keeps it up,

46:12.682 --> 46:15.729
more likely
you got yourselves
a rebellion

46:15.773 --> 46:17.078
across five states.

46:20.299 --> 46:22.388
Not that it makes
a difference to me,
of course.

46:22.431 --> 46:25.173
Luke, give us
one moment, please.

46:28.307 --> 46:31.919
[Adel] I'll give you $100.
Not a dime more.

46:31.963 --> 46:33.573
[man] It's the principle.
I'm in.

46:33.616 --> 46:35.227
[man 2] I want to catch him,
so I'm in.

46:35.270 --> 46:37.490
We have no choice.
I'm in.

46:38.970 --> 46:40.319
All right, Luke.

46:45.541 --> 46:47.717
But if we're gonna be
spending that much money,

46:47.761 --> 46:51.243
I'm afraid I'll have
to insist one of my men
goes with you.

46:52.331 --> 46:55.290
[snoring]

47:03.821 --> 47:05.474
[cork pops][sniffs]

47:08.390 --> 47:10.523
[sputtering]

47:10.566 --> 47:12.786
[gasps] The hell?

47:12.830 --> 47:15.920
Shields. You knew him?

47:15.963 --> 47:18.748
Yeah, yeah, I knew him.
Ow.

47:18.792 --> 47:20.402
Go on, now.

47:21.708 --> 47:24.319
He's a nigger.
They's all the same.

47:24.363 --> 47:26.887
That man
escaped your plantation

47:26.931 --> 47:29.237
and single-handedly killed
three of your men.

47:30.325 --> 47:32.762
Now, that sounds
pretty extraordinary to me.

47:35.417 --> 47:37.419
So, how about you tell me
something useful?

47:38.856 --> 47:41.075
He was smart, I guess.

47:42.555 --> 47:44.731
Smarter than
most white folk even.

47:46.515 --> 47:49.954
He just about run things
around here
till Hank come along.

47:52.173 --> 47:53.783
And they called him Emperor.

47:55.960 --> 47:58.310
He had an attitude
to back it up.

47:58.353 --> 47:59.789
What you know
about the Railroad?

47:59.833 --> 48:02.357
The Underground Railroad?Mm-hmm.

48:04.664 --> 48:08.102
Just a way for a bunch
of nigger-lovers to--

48:08.146 --> 48:10.496
Pardon me,
abolitionists--

48:10.539 --> 48:13.586
to get runaways up north.
[chuckles]

48:13.629 --> 48:15.196
[Randolph]
It ain't no use.

48:15.240 --> 48:17.677
White men don't know anything
about the stations.

48:19.200 --> 48:21.768
I wasn't planning
on asking no white man.

48:21.811 --> 48:24.205
[chattering]

48:26.512 --> 48:29.167
This man here made it
all the way to Pennsylvania

48:29.210 --> 48:31.430
before these old boys
nabbed his ass.

48:31.473 --> 48:33.127
Please
don't kill me, sir.
Please.

48:33.171 --> 48:35.869
Don't kill me, please.
Please.

48:35.913 --> 48:39.177
If anybody knows,
it's him.[whimpering]

48:40.700 --> 48:41.919
What's your name?

48:42.745 --> 48:44.399
Henry. Henry, sir.

48:45.618 --> 48:47.185
Well, Henry,

48:47.228 --> 48:50.188
I just negotiated your life
with the sheriff here.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.018
Oh, thank you.

48:54.061 --> 48:56.672
All you gotta do
to get this here noose
off your neck

48:56.716 --> 48:59.545
is point out
all the houses

48:59.588 --> 49:01.939
along that
Underground Railroad
of yours.

49:05.029 --> 49:06.291
Can you do that for me?

49:06.334 --> 49:07.727
[gasps]

49:14.038 --> 49:16.866
I don't--
I don't know nothing
about no railroad, sir.

49:21.523 --> 49:22.742
Suit yourself.

49:26.311 --> 49:27.921
[McCabe] Gentlemen.

49:27.965 --> 49:30.750
[whimpering]
Please don't kill me, sir.
Please.

49:30.793 --> 49:33.057
[sobbing]

49:33.927 --> 49:34.972
Wait!

49:37.061 --> 49:38.845
Show me that map
again, sir.

49:38.888 --> 49:43.241
[church bell tolling]

49:55.601 --> 49:59.431
[chattering]

50:04.523 --> 50:06.699
[breathing heavily]

50:12.226 --> 50:14.837
[chattering, chuckling]

50:19.929 --> 50:21.061
[gun hammer cocks]

50:28.677 --> 50:29.983
[man] Get him!

50:31.158 --> 50:32.942
-[gunshot]
-[woman screaming]

50:32.986 --> 50:34.596
[man] Hellfire!
Get out the street!

50:35.467 --> 50:37.382
[man] Come on,
move, move!

50:37.425 --> 50:39.253
-What the hell you doin'?
-What the hell you doin'?

50:39.297 --> 50:40.994
[gunfire]Shit!

50:42.517 --> 50:44.345
I just robbed the bank.

50:44.389 --> 50:46.521
This is my wagon.
You gotta go.

50:48.741 --> 50:51.439
-I can shoot.
-[gunfire continues]

50:51.483 --> 50:54.138
Other gun is in the bag.
Careful with the gunpowder.

50:59.099 --> 51:00.927
Git! Go![horse whinnies]

51:06.498 --> 51:08.543
Hey. What's happening?

51:08.587 --> 51:10.980
Some nigger
just robbed a bank.

51:14.114 --> 51:15.594
How you know it's him?

51:19.119 --> 51:22.253
[horse whinnies]What in the world?

51:25.865 --> 51:28.433
Holy mackerel!
We lost 'em.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.261
Whoo!

51:35.744 --> 51:38.486
Looks like you and me
got something in common.

51:38.530 --> 51:40.140
I'm Rufus Kelly.

51:40.184 --> 51:41.533
Maybe you heard of me?

51:41.576 --> 51:43.187
Can't say I have.

51:43.230 --> 51:45.363
I'm a famous bank robber.

51:45.406 --> 51:48.017
Yeah? How many banks
you done robbed?

51:48.670 --> 51:50.194
Three.

51:50.237 --> 51:53.110
Well, no, two,
including this one.

51:55.460 --> 51:57.418
You always bring
a loaded wagon
to a robbery?

51:57.462 --> 51:59.507
I ain't never been
chased before.

51:59.551 --> 52:01.422
[chuckles]
I guess I learned my lesson.

52:01.466 --> 52:02.771
Mm-hmm.[exhales]

52:03.772 --> 52:06.035
We make a good team.

52:06.079 --> 52:08.473
You ever considered going
into the outlaw business?

52:08.516 --> 52:11.954
Boy, I got the whole South
chasing me.
I'm already an outlaw.

52:13.130 --> 52:15.349
No shit. You might as well
make some money at it.

52:17.525 --> 52:19.875
[men whooping, yelling]

52:22.922 --> 52:24.402
They found us.

52:24.445 --> 52:26.360
Shit. Here, drive. Drive!

52:32.714 --> 52:35.978
[gunshots]

52:53.170 --> 52:54.258
[hammer clicks]

53:11.753 --> 53:13.451
[whinnies]

[groans]

53:32.861 --> 53:34.646
[gunshot][groans]

53:43.350 --> 53:44.264
[gunshot]

53:47.789 --> 53:48.877
You're hit.

53:55.275 --> 53:56.798
[groans]

53:58.757 --> 54:00.411
Hyah!

54:00.454 --> 54:02.151
We're falling apart.

54:02.195 --> 54:04.850
We gots to ditch the wagon.
Get on the horse.

54:04.893 --> 54:06.373
Goddamn it,
this is my house.

54:06.417 --> 54:07.505
[gunshot]Shit!

54:47.588 --> 54:48.763
Did we get 'em?

54:55.292 --> 54:57.816
[grunting]

54:57.859 --> 54:59.339
Fuckin' gutshot.

55:04.997 --> 55:06.085
[groans]

55:07.478 --> 55:09.784
Can't be no outlaw
without gettin' shot
at least once.

55:09.828 --> 55:12.178
You think I'm gonna
get credit for this one?

55:14.615 --> 55:17.096
I's thinkin'
front page news,
for sure.

55:18.271 --> 55:21.274
I can't wait to see my face
on a wanted poster.

55:22.536 --> 55:24.146
Boy, you's gonna be
a legend.

55:27.324 --> 55:29.804
Sure wish I had
a shot of whiskey for this.

55:33.025 --> 55:34.940
[chuckles] Me, too.

55:35.636 --> 55:38.030
All right.Wait. Wait.

55:41.599 --> 55:45.690
You could've left me
and took the cash,
but you didn't.

55:47.082 --> 55:48.823
Why not?

55:51.086 --> 55:53.915
You need me to get
some heat on that wound...

55:55.047 --> 55:56.483
'fore it get infected.

55:57.397 --> 55:58.398
You hear?

56:01.183 --> 56:02.663
If I make it...

56:04.012 --> 56:05.666
we split the loot 50/50.

56:07.842 --> 56:09.322
And if not...

56:10.758 --> 56:12.456
spend it on something nice.

56:12.499 --> 56:15.502
Hey, now.
You gonna make it out.

56:17.635 --> 56:18.984
Okay.

56:19.027 --> 56:21.073
All right?Yeah.

56:21.116 --> 56:22.248
Look at me.

56:22.291 --> 56:23.467
Come on.

56:24.903 --> 56:26.992
On three. One...

56:27.035 --> 56:28.776
-[sizzling]
-[muffled screaming]

56:50.450 --> 56:53.453
[rustling]

57:28.227 --> 57:29.358
Rufus.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.086
What you doin'
with that?

58:01.129 --> 58:04.742
Hush. I'll put it back
soon as Tommy read it for us.

58:08.180 --> 58:09.355
What it say?

58:12.706 --> 58:15.753
It say he rob a bank.A bank?

58:15.796 --> 58:17.537
Good God from Zion.

58:17.581 --> 58:19.974
He ain't in enough trouble,
now he's gonna rob banks?

58:20.018 --> 58:23.369
They couldn't catch him.
He got away.

58:23.412 --> 58:24.718
Read on, read on.

58:26.894 --> 58:28.896
It said a bounty
on his head.

58:30.028 --> 58:31.290
Thousand dollars.

58:31.333 --> 58:34.119
A thousand dollars?Oh, good Lord.

59:00.101 --> 59:01.276
[whistles]

59:08.936 --> 59:10.242
[whistles]

59:28.521 --> 59:29.914
Shields?

59:30.654 --> 59:31.959
You Levi Coffin?

59:32.003 --> 59:34.527
You got half the state
looking for you.

59:38.313 --> 59:39.750
Wasn't my intention.

59:42.753 --> 59:44.276
Just running for my life.

59:45.190 --> 59:46.234
Come on in.

59:52.066 --> 59:54.155
It's not safe
for you to stay here.

59:54.982 --> 59:56.680
I ain't fixin' to stay.

59:56.723 --> 59:59.770
I just need you
to point me
to the next station.

59:59.813 --> 01:00:02.337
What do you expect's
gonna happen
once you get up north?

01:00:05.993 --> 01:00:09.910
You're not just
a runaway slave anymore.
You're a symbol.

01:00:12.086 --> 01:00:15.481
And they're not gonna stop
until they make you pay.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:20.965
And your escape,
and your escapades,

01:00:21.008 --> 01:00:23.141
and your exploits...

01:00:24.838 --> 01:00:26.666
are putting
your own people,

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:29.364
as well as all the others
that are helping,

01:00:29.408 --> 01:00:30.627
at risk.

01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:36.589
You've gotta go
to Harpers Ferry.

01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:38.852
What's there?

01:00:38.896 --> 01:00:40.724
An abolitionist

01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:43.161
who's caused
a lot of mayhem

01:00:43.204 --> 01:00:45.119
in Lawrence, Kansas.

01:00:45.163 --> 01:00:47.600
His name's John Brown.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:50.734
But now the rumor has it
he's headed here
with a militia,

01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:51.952
and they're gonna fight.

01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:54.955
Fight?

01:00:57.871 --> 01:00:59.177
Fight for what?

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.179
To end slavery.

01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:05.444
I ain't fixin'
for no fight.

01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:07.272
I's just tryin'
to free my son.

01:01:08.316 --> 01:01:10.449
-[horse whinnying]
-Shh.

01:01:15.846 --> 01:01:17.630
You hiding a runaway
in here?

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.850
We have reason to believe

01:01:19.893 --> 01:01:22.809
a runaway slave's
residing on your premises.

01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:27.205
You mind if we come on in
and have ourselves a look?

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:28.554
Course I mind.

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:32.993
-You have no right
to come in here--
-Save it, old timer.

01:01:36.214 --> 01:01:38.259
He ain't just
a runaway slave.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:42.089
He's a murderer...

01:01:43.482 --> 01:01:44.831
a horse thief...

01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:48.530
and a bank robber.

01:01:53.274 --> 01:01:55.102
You know
we're gonna find him.

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.866
When I tell you,

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:05.085
you fire on that here wall.

01:03:15.443 --> 01:03:16.575
Don't hit me.

01:03:29.283 --> 01:03:30.894
[gunshots]

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.031
[Grady] Dang it!

01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:42.470
Goddamn it!

01:03:47.214 --> 01:03:48.999
Get the horses.

01:03:55.744 --> 01:03:58.399
I think he crossed
the damn river.

01:03:58.443 --> 01:04:00.967
Gonna make the job
a lot harder.

01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:02.490
He's in Maryland now.

01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:05.929
So he's free?

01:04:06.538 --> 01:04:07.931
For now.

01:04:09.497 --> 01:04:10.672
God--

01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:16.026
[owl hooting][crickets chirping]

01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:20.552
[guns cocking]

01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:28.212
You looking for this?

01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:33.130
Round these parts,
colored folks ain't allowed
to possess firearms.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.657
Well, I guess
I'm in trouble, then.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.226
Well, now, that'd be
mighty hypocritical of us
considering...

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:48.188
Wait.

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:53.977
I know who you is.
You're John Brown.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.327
I reckon that means
you must be Shields Green.

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:59.591
These are two of my sons,
Oliver and Watson.

01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:02.028
If you've done half
of what they say
you've done,

01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:03.682
we're gonna get along.

01:05:03.725 --> 01:05:05.553
And this here is
Dangerfield Newby.

01:05:05.597 --> 01:05:06.990
He's just joined
our cause.

01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:08.730
Glad to see you
made it this far.

01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:09.993
Yes, sir.

01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:13.735
You should
come with us.

01:05:13.779 --> 01:05:15.868
I got a friend
I'd like you to meet.

01:05:36.323 --> 01:05:38.195
That who I think it is?

01:05:38.238 --> 01:05:40.197
That's right, son.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.807
That's Frederick Douglass.

01:05:48.118 --> 01:05:50.120
We'll march
on Harpers Ferry

01:05:50.163 --> 01:05:51.773
and take
the federal armory.

01:05:51.817 --> 01:05:54.428
John--The time is now,
Frederick.

01:05:54.472 --> 01:05:56.387
This is not
what we discussed.

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:59.129
You said you wanted
to march Virginia slaves
to the Appalachia.

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:01.087
Foolhardy, yes,

01:06:01.131 --> 01:06:03.481
but within the realm
of possibility.

01:06:03.524 --> 01:06:05.265
But this.

01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:08.007
This is a steel trap
from which
you will not escape.

01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:10.009
When we strike,

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:13.317
and the slaves in the
surrounding plantations
hear of our victory,

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.841
they will know
we have the means to fight.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:19.323
Frederick,
I need you to help us.

01:06:21.107 --> 01:06:23.414
You're a brave man, John.

01:06:23.457 --> 01:06:26.939
You're risking your life
and the lives of your sons.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:31.030
But your optimism is
a luxury afforded to you
by the color of your skin.

01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:33.728
If you go through
with this,

01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:36.427
you will only serve
to make them hate us.

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:38.037
They already hate us.

01:06:40.431 --> 01:06:41.649
Who is this?

01:06:41.693 --> 01:06:43.521
This is Shields Green.

01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:45.871
Ah.

01:06:47.481 --> 01:06:48.569
Emperor.

01:06:51.485 --> 01:06:54.314
What are you
doing here?He came to join our cause.

01:06:54.358 --> 01:06:56.838
Do you realize you're going
to get yourself killed?

01:06:56.882 --> 01:07:00.277
Our deaths will be
the spark that lights
the fuse of rebellion.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.454
It's easy for you
to say that.

01:07:03.497 --> 01:07:06.109
The white men
among your ranks
can easily disappear

01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:07.588
back into
their old lives.

01:07:07.632 --> 01:07:09.634
But the Negro men
will be forced to suffer

01:07:09.677 --> 01:07:11.679
the full consequences
of your actions.

01:07:11.723 --> 01:07:16.032
What you see as nobility
in their deaths,
they see only as futility.

01:07:20.253 --> 01:07:22.212
What do they have
to lose, Frederick?

01:07:22.255 --> 01:07:23.865
If you follow through
with this,

01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:25.563
you'll be risking
all these lives.

01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:29.567
Think of your legacy.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:31.438
I think of nothing else.

01:07:50.022 --> 01:07:51.632
I needs to ask you a favor.

01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:55.462
No matter what happen to me,

01:07:55.506 --> 01:07:58.422
I need you to take
this here money

01:07:58.465 --> 01:08:00.293
and buy my son's freedom.

01:08:10.651 --> 01:08:12.218
[Douglass]
How does it feel?

01:08:13.393 --> 01:08:14.481
What?

01:08:20.444 --> 01:08:21.575
Freedom.

01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:26.189
I still remember
my first day.

01:08:31.368 --> 01:08:32.673
I don't know.

01:08:36.198 --> 01:08:37.983
Cost me everything.

01:08:41.203 --> 01:08:42.640
I can get you papers.

01:08:43.902 --> 01:08:46.033
A whole new identity.

01:08:46.078 --> 01:08:48.254
And send you up
to Canada.

01:08:48.298 --> 01:08:49.689
You'll be safe there.

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:52.519
Safe?

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:59.046
What is more important,
Frederick?

01:08:59.787 --> 01:09:01.788
Freedom for one man,

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:03.573
or freedom for all men?

01:09:08.448 --> 01:09:13.584
[sighs] This man
will never be a slave.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:18.676
Yet he's willing
to risk his life
and the life of his sons...

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:21.635
so we can be free.

01:09:23.984 --> 01:09:25.161
No, sir.

01:09:26.379 --> 01:09:29.381
I cannot sit idle while
this man fight for me.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:38.390
We can't all fight this war
with the pen, Mr. Douglass.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.050
Some of us best equipped
to fight this war
with a gun.

01:09:50.881 --> 01:09:52.796
I think I'll go
with the old man.

01:09:59.151 --> 01:10:00.326
It's an honor.

01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:04.374
I do this for my son.

01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:27.875
[gunshots]

01:10:35.274 --> 01:10:36.971
[shouting]

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.809
[grunting]

01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:51.464
[whispers]
John, are you all right?

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.615
Your son would be proud
of what you did today.

01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:18.752
Is it true what they say?

01:11:18.796 --> 01:11:20.624
That you're descended
from royalty?

01:11:26.978 --> 01:11:28.588
[sighs] Well...

01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:31.896
that what my mama
used to say.

01:11:32.766 --> 01:11:34.159
[chuckles]

01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:38.032
Don't make no difference
if it's true or not.

01:11:41.732 --> 01:11:45.475
Slave, master, king...

01:11:47.738 --> 01:11:49.348
they all the same to me.

01:11:51.132 --> 01:11:52.264
Hmm.

01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:57.922
Better get some rest.

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:00.664
Good night, sir.

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:08.498
Dangerfield.

01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:11.239
Hey, Dangerfield.
What you reading, boy?

01:12:11.283 --> 01:12:13.807
These the letters
from my sweet thing.

01:12:13.851 --> 01:12:15.374
[chuckles] Yeah?

01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:16.419
Yeah.

01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:19.944
Soon as we settle up here,

01:12:19.987 --> 01:12:22.773
I'm gonna go back
and I'm gonna free her
and all my kids.

01:12:27.908 --> 01:12:29.388
What about you?

01:12:29.432 --> 01:12:31.259
What you fixin' to do?

01:12:54.108 --> 01:12:56.415
It ain't my fault,
you know.

01:12:58.243 --> 01:13:00.550
All's I'm sayin' is,

01:13:00.593 --> 01:13:02.595
gettin' in shoot-outs
ain't my vocation.

01:13:03.596 --> 01:13:06.033
Just 'cause I hesitated
a little bit,

01:13:06.077 --> 01:13:07.818
that don't make me yellow.

01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:10.995
-[man] Gonna teach
that old boy a lesson.
-[chattering]

01:13:11.038 --> 01:13:12.866
Militia.

01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:15.565
Bored farm boys
itchin' for somethin' to do.

01:13:15.608 --> 01:13:18.394
[chattering continues]

01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:20.047
Where's all
the excitement?

01:13:20.091 --> 01:13:23.007
Crazy abolitionists
took over Harpers Ferry.

01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:25.139
Marines is on their way.
We're goin' to help 'em.

01:13:26.227 --> 01:13:28.578
Abolitionists,
you say.That's right.

01:13:50.991 --> 01:13:52.428
Dad. Dad.

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:54.342
What? What?

01:13:54.386 --> 01:13:55.474
They're here.

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:56.519
Oh!

01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:58.390
[Oliver chuckles] Whoo!

01:13:59.217 --> 01:14:01.001
[laughing]

01:14:01.045 --> 01:14:02.481
Come on.

01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:04.483
Open the gates![man] Open the gates!

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:07.225
-They're here!
-[cheering]

01:14:08.705 --> 01:14:09.923
I knew it.

01:14:13.623 --> 01:14:15.668
[man]
Open the gates!

01:14:18.062 --> 01:14:19.237
How many?

01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:45.263
Close the gates.

01:14:46.656 --> 01:14:49.572
-Sir?
-I said close the gates!

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:54.664
[Dangerfield]
Close the gates!

01:15:08.852 --> 01:15:11.724
I demand to speak
to the man in charge.

01:15:11.768 --> 01:15:15.293
I am Osawatomie
John Brown.

01:15:15.336 --> 01:15:17.164
I am in charge.

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:20.167
Mr. Brown,
I'm Lieutenant Colonel
Robert E. Lee

01:15:20.211 --> 01:15:22.387
of the United States Army.

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:26.086
I'm here on orders by
President James Buchanan

01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:28.741
to demand that you
and your outlaws

01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:30.569
surrender this fort.

01:15:30.613 --> 01:15:32.789
I'm willing
to offer leniency

01:15:32.832 --> 01:15:35.531
in exchange for
a peaceful surrender.

01:15:41.624 --> 01:15:44.496
I hate to disappoint you,
Colonel,

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.325
but you're not likely
to get a peaceful anything
from us.

01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:52.025
Not while that abomination
called slavery

01:15:52.069 --> 01:15:54.985
is still the law
of this land.

01:15:55.028 --> 01:16:00.207
Not when Negro blood
flows in our rivers
and irrigates our crops.

01:16:01.382 --> 01:16:04.603
Not till every last man,
woman and child

01:16:04.647 --> 01:16:07.127
is freed from their chains

01:16:07.171 --> 01:16:08.999
will we ever surrender.

01:16:09.042 --> 01:16:12.568
You are evidently
a man of passion,
Mr. Brown.

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.787
I can respect that.

01:16:16.267 --> 01:16:19.052
But I'm not here
to make moral judgments.

01:16:19.096 --> 01:16:21.402
I'm here
to enforce the law.

01:16:22.882 --> 01:16:26.582
And I am here to enforce
a higher law,

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:28.975
extolled, you might recall,

01:16:29.019 --> 01:16:31.151
in the Declaration
of Independence...

01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:36.069
that all men
are created equal.

01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:39.595
Need I remind you,
Mr. Brown,

01:16:39.638 --> 01:16:42.119
that the man
that penned those words
was a slave owner.

01:16:43.033 --> 01:16:45.992
Are you accusing
Thomas Jefferson,

01:16:46.819 --> 01:16:48.995
one of our
founding fathers,

01:16:49.909 --> 01:16:51.737
of being a hypocrite?

01:16:51.781 --> 01:16:54.261
The way I read it,

01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:56.481
he didn't think
colored people were men.

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:01.617
Who is it decides
who is a man or not, Colonel?

01:17:03.401 --> 01:17:04.663
Almighty God

01:17:06.273 --> 01:17:07.797
or Thomas Jefferson?

01:17:10.103 --> 01:17:11.801
I'll go with God.

01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:15.979
So I'm to take it
you'll not go down
without a fight.

01:17:20.157 --> 01:17:22.812
Take it as you will, sir.

01:17:24.727 --> 01:17:25.989
So be it.

01:17:29.122 --> 01:17:31.647
-Send 'em in.
-[officer] Yes, sir.

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:37.783
Company, forward march!

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:43.180
Ready! Aim! Fire!

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.231
To the left.All right.

01:17:51.275 --> 01:17:53.364
Ready! Aim! Fire!

01:17:55.845 --> 01:17:58.717
-[men shouting]
-Move! Come on!

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.505
[officer] Fire!

01:18:15.038 --> 01:18:16.256
[groans]

01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:19.303
[officer] Reload!

01:18:22.219 --> 01:18:24.525
All right, fire.Get the end.

01:18:24.569 --> 01:18:25.875
Let's get 'em!

01:18:25.918 --> 01:18:27.224
[officer shouts]

01:18:29.226 --> 01:18:30.314
[screaming]

01:18:33.491 --> 01:18:36.363
[officer continues
shouting]
