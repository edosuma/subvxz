WEBVTT

00:08.617 --> 00:10.899
All right, I think
it"s recording.

00:10.923 --> 00:13.119
Wait, I"m not ready yet.
Just be in the moment.

00:13.143 --> 00:15.687
Just do what we normally
do when we have sex.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.254
What do we normally do?

00:17.278 --> 00:18.627
We just do it.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.867
Shit, I"m sorry. Gosh!

00:21.891 --> 00:23.023
Should I put my hair up?

00:23.980 --> 00:25.958
Maybe we don"t have to kiss.

00:25.982 --> 00:28.182
Ow, ow, ow. Hey, ow, ow, ow,
you"re pulling my hair.

00:28.206 --> 00:29.788
No, the other hair.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.964
Okay, you"re still
fucking it up.

00:31.988 --> 00:36.316
Jesus, God, don"t judge me.
This is very vulnerable.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.473
Okay, we just need
to find a rhythm.

00:39.952 --> 00:43.062
Hey... Ow, ow, hey, you"re...

00:43.086 --> 00:44.803
My head"s... Could
you pull me down?

00:44.827 --> 00:45.891
Here, here.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.675
No, don"t French kiss my neck,

00:47.699 --> 00:49.242
just kiss my neck.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.896
I don"t think that
this is happening.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.053
Aren"t you supposed
to fake it, at least?

00:57.535 --> 00:58.535
Happy?

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

02:20.488 --> 02:22.683
Habits define
exactly who we are.

02:22.707 --> 02:25.382
They exhibit our
personalities, our behavior.

02:25.406 --> 02:29.255
Routines regulate our
efficiency or inefficiency.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.953
One"s habits affect their
perception of others

02:31.977 --> 02:35.633
and most importantly, their
perception of themselves.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.437
It"s hot as balls here.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.506
Hmm, global warming?

03:24.204 --> 03:26.182
More like just Texas, you know?

03:26.206 --> 03:29.185
You think when you get married we"re
still actually gonna do this?

03:29.209 --> 03:32.100
Or are you gonna like spawn
and join the PTA and shit?

03:32.124 --> 03:34.257
Oh, yeah, because that"s
totally who I am.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.433
Minivan and all.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.949
No, but you"re a closet-normal
person, for sure.

03:54.973 --> 03:56.037
I agree.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.388
P.S., Lana seems happy... Mmm.

03:58.412 --> 03:59.606
In pictures.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.869
In a very, like, contrived
way, of course.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.437
Other people"s
happiness disturbs me.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.786
You"re a hopeless romantic.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.730
No, I just don"t understand
what the big deal is.

04:07.754 --> 04:10.791
Like, the marriage
thing, the baby thing.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.793
It"s like, not everybody's
version of normal.

04:12.817 --> 04:15.535
Oh, please, you"re gonna
end up with like five.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.015
How long have you known me?

04:17.039 --> 04:18.886
Like a hundred years.

04:18.910 --> 04:21.510
And have I ever once said that I
want to have a baby or a husband?

04:21.534 --> 04:24.624
No, but to be fair, I"m,
like, drunk half the time.

04:26.135 --> 04:29.332
This is just that whole turning
30 drama everybody talks about.

04:29.356 --> 04:33.510
Just let it fall over you like
a warm blanket on a cold day.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.686
I see your blanket, I twist
it, tie it in a knot,

04:35.710 --> 04:37.253
hang myself with it,

04:37.277 --> 04:38.732
and then I address
a note that says,

04:38.756 --> 04:39.931
"This is all your fault."

04:40.758 --> 04:42.258
That"s a lot.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.911
Are your eyes gonna go
cross like that, too?

04:43.935 --> 04:46.255
I don "t know, I can" t really
predict how my eyes will be.

04:46.279 --> 04:47.639
But I"ll definitely
stare you down.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.867
Zoe, are you serious?

05:26.891 --> 05:29.174
Oh, hey, Jay, good morning.

05:29.198 --> 05:30.915
You"re practically
naked out here.

05:30.939 --> 05:33.004
I got kids inside.
You get that, right?

05:33.028 --> 05:35.920
You know what? I can, like, get a
curtain from IKEA or something.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.356
Zoe, as your landlord...

05:37.380 --> 05:39.445
Whoa, actually, I own my house.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.491
So, you"re not my landlord.

05:41.515 --> 05:44.015
Yeah, and I own the ground
that it"s parked on.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.973
I own this whole lawn.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.411
But who really owns the ground?

05:48.435 --> 05:51.327
You are two weeks behind
on rent this month.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.806
I"m so sorry.

05:52.830 --> 05:56.070
I need you to pay me
to use this ground.

05:56.094 --> 05:59.030
Hey, Jay, you know I can hear
the words you"re saying.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.206
You don"t also have to act
them out with your hands.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.469
Excuse me if my expressions
are intimidating.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.341
Because I need you to pay me.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.085
Yeah, sure, we can talk
about this tomorrow.

06:07.109 --> 06:08.522
You know what? I"m actually
running a little late

06:08.546 --> 06:10.607
to a wedding, so... You
can pay me tomorrow.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.783
You can hand me an envelope
of money tomorrow,

06:12.807 --> 06:16.134
or you can find a new place
to park your tiny home, okay?

06:16.158 --> 06:17.377
Cool, great.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.162
Wait, does it have to be cash?

06:37.875 --> 06:39.549
This...

06:39.573 --> 06:41.377
Could not have happened
to a nicer couple.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.074
No, actually, it
totally could have.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.597
"Really goin" for it.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.382
This is like pornographic.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.209
Oh, Lana, is this it.
Is this it?

06:48.233 --> 06:50.671
Oh, Peter. Should I
get my head lamp on?

06:51.889 --> 06:54.172
Did she just cum? I
think the mom did.

06:54.196 --> 06:55.565
Great job!

06:55.589 --> 06:57.175
I just missed it.

06:57.199 --> 07:01.309
All right, thank you to every one
for being here on our big day.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.834
We really appreciate all of you.

07:03.858 --> 07:07.838
But now I"m gonna need
all the single ladies!

07:07.862 --> 07:11.015
Get up here!

07:11.039 --> 07:14.148
Yeah, and it"s you.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.586
You"re single, Sarah, by the way.
Now, you go up.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.570
Yeah, but after what happened
at the last wedding,

07:18.594 --> 07:20.503
I"m just tryin' to
mind my P"s and Q's.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.722
Uh-oh, I see you.

07:22.746 --> 07:25.682
I see some single ladies
hiding out in the back there!

07:25.706 --> 07:27.118
Zoe...

07:27.142 --> 07:29.884
I know you"re single!

07:31.842 --> 07:34.734
Zoe! Zoe! Zoe!

07:34.758 --> 07:37.631
Zoe. Come on up!

07:41.548 --> 07:43.047
Get up here!

07:43.071 --> 07:44.396
"I fucking" hate myself.

07:44.420 --> 07:48.052
If anyone gets in your
way, duck and hit.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.924
Last wedding, I got arrested
because I hit somebody,

07:50.948 --> 07:52.341
I didn"t duck.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.866
All right, let"s do this!

07:56.650 --> 08:00.088
One, two, three.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.207
Shit!

09:02.977 --> 09:04.911
No. Hold up.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.347
We scheduled this.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.306
It"s on the joint calendar.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.395
Okay, well, you know.

09:10.419 --> 09:13.311
Same time next week, that
bell goes off, I"m all yours.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.139
You said that last week.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.141
It"s been like three months.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.969
Oh, God, okay, fine.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.187
But can you be quick?

09:20.211 --> 09:21.491
I have a meeting in the morning.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.127
Oh, my God!

09:47.151 --> 09:48.825
The condo"s going up next door!

09:48.849 --> 09:52.306
I have reported them multiple
times for working after 9:00...

09:52.330 --> 09:54.787
Just forget about it.

09:54.811 --> 09:57.224
Zone out.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.728
All we need is right here.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.296
Okay. Okay.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.015
I"m zoning out.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.257
Zone it out.

10:08.390 --> 10:11.543
I swear if one more artisanal
cupcake shop goes on our block,

10:11.567 --> 10:14.154
I"m gonna lose my goddamn mind.

10:14.178 --> 10:15.527
I"m...

10:16.790 --> 10:20.054
I"m sorry, I can't. I just...
I can"t.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.971
Maybe you should have an affair.

10:33.023 --> 10:38.352
Reaganomics, higher
taxes, school prayer.

10:38.376 --> 10:41.529
Is this the 2000 Convention?
Yep.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.357
Where did you get this on Blu

10:43.381 --> 10:47.603
YouTube, and then I had my IT
guy at work burn it for you.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.266
Honey, just let me
see this one part.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.995
You know, Lana told me that you
don"t have a lot of customers.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.693
So I just want to support
another business.

11:14.717 --> 11:18.436
Oh, well, that was
nice of her, I guess.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.526
I actually own Forbidden
Fruit down the street.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.049
Oh, the sex shop.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.877
Adult marketplace. Oh.

11:24.901 --> 11:28.272
People have told me they never
quite seen anything like my vagina

11:28.296 --> 11:31.516
and I choose to take
that as a compliment.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.583
Whoo, I lost my
visor on that one!

11:35.607 --> 11:38.108
That was a good one.
Very satisfying.

11:38.132 --> 11:40.458
Oh, yeah, you feel good? Yeah.

11:40.482 --> 11:44.244
I"m just in that state of mind
where I"m like, full bush!

11:44.268 --> 11:45.942
I go out in my
bathing suit like,

11:45.966 --> 11:48.858
I"ve had a couple children
point at it and say,

11:48.882 --> 11:50.642
"What"s that, Mom?"

11:50.666 --> 11:52.862
Oh, my God!

11:52.886 --> 11:56.237
I think I"m dying.
My pussy is on fire!

11:57.542 --> 12:00.347
I am gonna titty punch you!
Okay.

12:00.371 --> 12:03.133
Zoe, do you want to
just come over here

12:03.157 --> 12:04.985
and hold me for a second?

12:06.856 --> 12:08.268
Ms. Crandle, I"m so sorry.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.270
But we"re gonna have to
reject your application

12:10.294 --> 12:12.403
for a small-business loan today.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.839
Darn. But I can offer you

12:13.863 --> 12:16.189
one of these fantastic
drink koozies.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.538
Compliments of the bank.

12:17.562 --> 12:20.193
Oh, great, yes. Because
the drink koozy

12:20.217 --> 12:22.369
is really gonna take the
edge off the complete

12:22.393 --> 12:23.849
and total destruction
of my life.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.633
Maybe you can try
someplace else?

12:25.657 --> 12:28.201
Maybe you have some
friends or family?

12:28.225 --> 12:30.271
What about your parents?

13:18.101 --> 13:20.688
If he"s cheating on me, I
need to step my game up.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.647
I have been watching
only PornTube,

13:22.671 --> 13:24.736
like, literally all the time.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.477
Oh, I really like
PornTube, you know?

13:26.501 --> 13:28.740
There"s something
very Warhol about it.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.133
Yeah, right?

13:30.157 --> 13:33.353
I mean, a babysitter anal
series is like super artsy.

13:33.377 --> 13:37.793
Okay, Claire, why don"t
you just end it?

13:37.817 --> 13:40.491
Okay, I found someone.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.319
Someone who"s great on paper

13:42.343 --> 13:44.408
and looks good next
to me in pictures.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.043
Someone who wants to marry me
even though I"m, you know,

13:47.914 --> 13:50.762
me and everything.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.919
Right? When you love
someone, you fight for it.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.009
Even if it feels wrong.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.645
It"s beautiful, right?

14:04.669 --> 14:08.258
I mean, it will be when
we put it on a dimmer.

14:08.282 --> 14:09.868
Are we looking at the
same thing here?

14:09.892 --> 14:11.565
Don"t do this.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.133
Jane, I can"t even
walk under it.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.832
I"m gonna smash into
this thing one day.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.313
This thing is set
up for me to lose.

14:20.337 --> 14:23.316
Have you noticed that it"s
getting harder and harder

14:23.340 --> 14:25.212
to walk around our house?

14:26.561 --> 14:28.495
Yeah, well, have you noticed,

14:28.519 --> 14:31.150
since we"re, you know,
spit-balling here,

14:31.174 --> 14:33.457
that the towels in the
bathroom are always a mess?

14:33.481 --> 14:35.894
No. You have a towel thing.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.375
I have a towel thing? Yes,
you have a towel thing.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.768
The hand towels are always askew

14:40.792 --> 14:42.403
and it drives me
up a fucking wall.

14:42.707 --> 14:43.752
Okay.

14:45.319 --> 14:49.734
Okay, no more askew
towels, got it.

14:49.758 --> 14:52.911
Have you given any thought to
what I said the other night?

14:52.935 --> 14:55.696
What? Having an affair.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.394
No.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.699
Maybe I"m not joking.

14:58.723 --> 14:59.918
People do that, right?

14:59.942 --> 15:03.095
They open up the
marriage to save it?

15:03.119 --> 15:05.315
I don"t know, maybe we
could be those people.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.839
Yeah, I don"t wanna be
those kind of people.

15:07.863 --> 15:12.650
I wanna be the kind of
person that"s just for you.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.176
Mmm.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.442
Oh, my God!

16:34.297 --> 16:36.430
Don "t fuck him, he" s a client.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.702
ZOE: Do you want any
help with that?

17:32.921 --> 17:34.942
No, I think I got it.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.293
Just let me know if it"s even.

17:37.317 --> 17:41.036
It"s even just pull it
tight, much tighter.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.428
The weather in Texas
changes a lot.

17:42.452 --> 17:44.343
You don"t want anybody
to miss this.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.412
How"s that?

17:46.978 --> 17:49.503
Ah, perfect.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.375
It"s a little on the nose.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.964
Yeah, I was going
for simple and sad.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.268
Oh, well, I think you nailed it.

17:58.292 --> 17:59.445
Yeah, I feel good about it.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.187
You want to come in?

18:02.211 --> 18:04.581
I mean, if you"re open.

18:04.605 --> 18:05.997
We"re open now.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.890
I can"t believe this
place is closing.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.718
You know, I love Paul"s Picks?

18:11.742 --> 18:15.374
Paul does have exquisite taste.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.420
You"re Paul, aren't you?
Paul, nice to meet you.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.663
Hi, I"m Zoe. Hi, Zoe.

18:21.230 --> 18:24.035
So are these alphabetized or...

18:24.059 --> 18:25.993
I sort of have my
own system going.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.300
I"ve seen pretty much
every film here.

18:28.324 --> 18:30.346
So it forces people
to ask me questions.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.285
Which is nice, because
I get a little lonely.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.786
Well, not to sound
like a stalker.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.136
But I saw you all alone

18:38.160 --> 18:40.660
at Lana"s super boring wedding.

18:40.684 --> 18:43.446
Yeah, I was with my wife.

18:43.470 --> 18:48.581
She was in the Delta
Gamma thing with her.

18:48.605 --> 18:49.887
Were you in that?

18:49.911 --> 18:52.194
No, no, I"m not a joiner.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.761
I majored in
ass-sitting college,

18:54.785 --> 18:57.286
and by college, I
mean, I did not go.

18:57.310 --> 19:00.593
Hmm. I did. Majored
in philosophy.

19:00.617 --> 19:03.770
Hmm. And now I have all of this.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.250
For not that much longer.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.904
Hey, don"t be so
hard on yourself.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.514
It"s not your fault,
it"s the economy

19:08.538 --> 19:10.777
and you know all that
crap I fall asleep to

19:10.801 --> 19:13.867
while listening to CNN. Mmm.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.348
Well, I got a few more
months on my lease.

19:16.372 --> 19:19.308
I figure, why not
revel in my failure?

19:19.332 --> 19:22.789
That"s a good plan, Paul.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.922
I do that, like, all the time.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.252
So, welcome to the club.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.795
Thanks.

19:28.819 --> 19:31.494
I own the waxing business
across the street.

19:31.518 --> 19:34.149
So if you ever need any detail
work on your bikini line...

19:34.173 --> 19:36.063
Yeah, I might take
you up on that.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.369
Cool. It"s a mess down there.

19:37.393 --> 19:40.807
Well, it was nice
to meet you, Paul.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.462
You, too, Zoe. So,
I"ll see you later.

19:43.486 --> 19:46.596
Fuck, who put that there?

19:46.620 --> 19:48.622
I did. There.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.059
Bye, Zoe.

19:53.583 --> 19:54.584
Bye, Paul.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.963
So how do you know that
Jim"s gonna be here?

20:05.987 --> 20:08.705
I"ve traced all of his credit
card receipts back to this place,

20:08.729 --> 20:10.315
he"s here every Tuesday at noon.

20:10.339 --> 20:13.057
You"re such a psychopath.
Whatever.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.754
Oh, my God. I see
him, I see him,

20:14.778 --> 20:17.148
Oh, my God, was he with anyone?
I don"t know, I panicked.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.671
We need to get closer.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.238
You know some people go to
lunch just to have lunch?

20:20.262 --> 20:22.382
Well, we"re not some people
and I need you to walk by.

20:22.406 --> 20:23.720
I don"t want to.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.833
Zoe, I need you to walk by.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.610
To-go containers.

20:44.634 --> 20:45.722
You ready to go?

20:46.309 --> 20:47.309
Wanna get a drink?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.919
It"s noon, I have to work.

20:48.943 --> 20:49.943
So?

20:54.731 --> 20:56.231
He"s not cheating on me, right?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.668
No. No, right?

20:58.692 --> 21:00.235
No way.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.976
I mean, there aren"t even
enough hours in the day.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.109
Yeah, who has the time for that?

21:05.133 --> 21:06.937
You know what I realized?

21:06.961 --> 21:08.808
I want to find a soulmate.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.897
But my house is only big
enough for one person.

21:10.921 --> 21:13.509
Hmm. Unless they
get on top of me.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.076
So then, I guess, like, you
can fit more people in there

21:16.100 --> 21:17.600
if somebody gets on top of them.

21:17.624 --> 21:20.037
And you could just, like,
keep stacking people.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.692
So, the ceiling"s the limit.

21:22.716 --> 21:26.173
Unless you built a sunroof.
Yeah.

21:26.197 --> 21:29.699
Okay, so he"s definitely
not cheating on me, right?

21:29.723 --> 21:31.048
I have nothing to worry about.

21:31.072 --> 21:33.833
Not a thing to worry about.

21:33.857 --> 21:35.772
Definitely not. Uh-uh.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.342
I mean, unless he is.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.322
So, we"re seriously doing this?

21:44.346 --> 21:46.150
We"re going through
your fiance"s trash

21:46.174 --> 21:47.456
in the middle of the night?

21:47.480 --> 21:49.022
Okay, when a man enters you,

21:49.046 --> 21:51.373
you have a right to his garbage.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.157
You know what? I"m going in.

21:53.181 --> 21:54.811
What? No.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.856
No, that"s breaking
and entering.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.989
I"m not breaking,
I"m just entering.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.928
Wait, Claire!

22:04.018 --> 22:05.387
Claire!

22:05.411 --> 22:06.411
Claire!

22:11.634 --> 22:13.569
Why are we searching
the kitchen?

22:13.593 --> 22:16.422
Because it is the last place
anyone would think to look.

22:17.858 --> 22:20.097
I don"t know, clean
people don"t cheat.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.751
His maid comes twice a week.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.580
Maybe he"s fucking her.

22:24.604 --> 22:25.844
Hey, that"d be kinda brilliant.

22:25.868 --> 22:27.626
She could just clean
up afterward.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.348
Ugh, that"s not funny.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.806
Wait, are you
sniffing his clothes?

22:33.830 --> 22:36.722
Well, if I don"t sniff for vanilla
musk and scan for body glitter,

22:36.746 --> 22:39.116
how do I know if he"s
been to a strip club?

22:39.140 --> 22:40.750
I"ll allow it. Thank you.

22:45.625 --> 22:49.542
Oh, things just got weird.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.913
Oh, my God, Zoe,
take off the mask.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.176
Zoe, take off the mask!

22:56.200 --> 22:58.333
Zoe, take off the fucking mask!

22:59.508 --> 23:00.944
Oh, my God.

23:01.684 --> 23:02.772
Oh.

23:14.349 --> 23:16.264
All right, Nate. Nate, stop.

23:16.873 --> 23:19.243
Stop. Stay.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.724
Look, buddy, it
would be so awesome

23:21.748 --> 23:24.030
if you would just
stop the dog thing.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.032
Because you"re not
a dog, Nathan.

23:26.056 --> 23:28.624
You"re a kid, and
you"re a great kid.

23:29.364 --> 23:30.713
So, what do you say?

23:32.715 --> 23:35.675
Stand up and walk on
your own two feet?

23:39.069 --> 23:40.525
He bit me, dude.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.159
I know, but he"s so cute.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.703
We make awesome kids.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.773
I mean, they"re weird
as shit, but awesome.

23:48.992 --> 23:51.101
So, listen, I was thinking...

23:51.125 --> 23:53.867
The affair thing,
is that still a go?

23:56.696 --> 23:58.088
Yeah, totally.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.489
Should I let you know when...
No, I don"t want to

24:02.513 --> 24:03.766
hear details or anything.

24:03.790 --> 24:04.790
Cool.

24:07.794 --> 24:09.206
Hey, guys...

24:09.230 --> 24:11.110
Not in the street. Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:11.134 --> 24:12.165
Get your brother.

24:12.189 --> 24:13.558
Just stop him.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.062
Come here. Come here, boy.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.442
Whoa, wax your bush.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.660
Wax your bush.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.084
Try out the wax
studio, right there.

24:30.108 --> 24:31.968
Hello, your wife looks
like she needs a wax.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.839
Sir, sir, sorry.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.014
It"s a little...

24:35.038 --> 24:36.320
You wanna wax your bush?

24:36.344 --> 24:37.887
Wax your bush.

24:37.911 --> 24:38.931
Wax your bush.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.106
Wax your bush. Thank you.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.697
Wait, hey!

24:44.178 --> 24:45.677
Hey, Zoe.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.861
Hey this is not working. I
am fucked right now, Claire.

24:47.885 --> 24:48.854
What"s up?

24:48.878 --> 24:50.247
I"m just scaring people away.

24:50.271 --> 24:51.901
Nobody gets the double entendre.

24:51.925 --> 24:55.818
Oh, you just said "double
entendre" and now I am worried.

24:55.842 --> 24:58.951
Just pour yourself a
vodka soda and know that

24:58.975 --> 25:01.737
if you build it, they"ll come.

25:01.761 --> 25:02.892
They should.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.439
Hey.

25:08.463 --> 25:09.463
Hey.

25:09.812 --> 25:11.442
Oh, hey.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.815
Nice double entendre.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.272
Thank you.

25:15.296 --> 25:16.926
You doing okay? You
look a little...

25:16.950 --> 25:17.927
Yeah, no, I"m good.

25:17.951 --> 25:20.364
I"m really... Really good.

25:20.388 --> 25:22.235
Yeah. Why, do I not look okay?

25:22.259 --> 25:23.889
No, you look hot.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.175
Double entendre.

25:27.308 --> 25:28.590
What are you doing right now?

25:28.614 --> 25:31.244
Oh, you know, I"m...

25:31.268 --> 25:33.725
Just probably gonna jump
off a bridge or something.

25:33.749 --> 25:36.336
Yeah, you gotta get outta
politics, it"s killing you.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.754
Come on.

25:52.246 --> 25:54.901
Can I buy you a drink?

25:56.119 --> 25:59.664
Um, nope, I have
a drink already.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.361
What is your name?

26:01.385 --> 26:02.493
Are we allowed to do names?

26:02.517 --> 26:03.797
I thought we weren"t
doing names.

26:03.821 --> 26:07.106
You can make one
up, if you"d like.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.848
Oh, okay. Um...

26:09.872 --> 26:12.658
Great, I didn"t really give
that any advanced thought.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.028
Um, Allison.

26:16.052 --> 26:18.228
No, I hate Allison,
she is a total...

26:19.621 --> 26:21.188
Melania.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.777
That is also equally vile.

26:25.801 --> 26:26.846
Um...

26:27.934 --> 26:29.651
Lola?

26:29.675 --> 26:32.001
That"s cute... No, that"s
trying too hard, isn"t it?

26:32.025 --> 26:33.069
Nice to meet you, Lola.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.615
Wow, you"re really getting
into that hand, aren"t you?

26:37.639 --> 26:39.095
No, no, no.

26:39.119 --> 26:41.817
Uh, sorry, I"m just not into...

26:42.688 --> 26:44.515
Public displays of affection.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.322
So, how do we...
How do we do this?

26:49.346 --> 26:51.218
You tell me what you like.

26:53.220 --> 26:56.199
Okay. Um...

26:56.223 --> 27:01.010
Well, I like C-SPAN,
I like to workout,

27:02.708 --> 27:04.555
I like watching
people hoard on TV.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.625
Okay, how "bout I
figure this out?"

27:10.846 --> 27:11.846
Um...

27:14.110 --> 27:15.435
You don"t...

27:15.459 --> 27:17.723
You don"t have any
cold sores, do you?

27:18.332 --> 27:19.463
No.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.659
Okay.

27:21.683 --> 27:25.097
It"s just that like, 85% of
the population has herpes.

27:25.121 --> 27:27.447
So it"s a valid question.

27:27.471 --> 27:30.605
Um, I would really prefer
not to take off my clothes.

27:31.911 --> 27:33.782
Okay.

27:37.090 --> 27:40.528
I "m sorry, I" ve never been
with anyone besides my husband.

27:52.148 --> 27:56.128
I just thought I might
take you to a movie,

27:56.152 --> 27:57.434
if that"s all right.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.827
What do you think?

27:58.851 --> 28:01.525
Wow, did you set this
all up yourself?

28:01.549 --> 28:03.701
Yeah, I"m not so
great at sleeping.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.877
So I just come up
here and hang out.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.792
It"s like I have my own
personal drive-in.

28:07.816 --> 28:10.969
Yeah, at night I stay
up making mixed CDs.

28:10.993 --> 28:13.033
I mean, I guess they"re
called playlists now, but...

28:13.057 --> 28:14.581
Dude, you do realize
that mixed CDs

28:14.605 --> 28:16.105
are like a lost art form, right?

28:16.129 --> 28:17.280
Yeah.

28:17.304 --> 28:19.238
Yeah, every girl I
liked in high school

28:19.262 --> 28:21.327
would get these, like,
heart-wrenching,

28:21.351 --> 28:23.765
80s hair band, power
ballad mixes.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.376
Oh, no, Paul, you"re
a hair band guy?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.639
Sorry, yes.

28:28.663 --> 28:32.512
That is both very lame and
kinda, sorta awesome.

28:32.536 --> 28:33.862
Thank you.

28:33.886 --> 28:38.064
Wow, I sleep up here more
than I care to admit.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.785
Can I ask you something?

28:43.809 --> 28:46.570
Whoo, I hate questions
that start with that.

28:46.594 --> 28:48.006
But, sure.

28:48.030 --> 28:51.488
Why were you alone in
your car at the wedding?

28:51.512 --> 28:52.619
You know, when I...

28:52.643 --> 28:54.186
Got high and lit
yourself on fire?

28:54.210 --> 28:56.493
Okay, we don"t need
a play-by-play.

28:56.517 --> 28:59.433
I was, you know...

29:00.695 --> 29:02.586
I was giving my wife some space.

29:02.610 --> 29:05.937
Pretty sure she can"t
stand to be around me.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.417
We"re hardly ever having sex.

29:07.441 --> 29:09.462
And when we do, it
takes way too long.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.638
It"s kinda like that wedding
scene in The Deer Hunter.

29:11.662 --> 29:14.816
My every day is like the wedding
scene in The Deer Hunter.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.993
I started listening to 7 Habits
of Highly Effective People

29:18.017 --> 29:20.735
on audio tape and it turns
out, I have none of them.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.824
Yeah, it took Jane"s
parents bailing me out

29:22.848 --> 29:24.260
for, like, the hundredth time

29:24.284 --> 29:26.262
before I came to
that conclusion.

29:26.286 --> 29:28.743
Well, my parents have
been dead for 13 years.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.528
So I can"t exactly
bother them for cash.

29:31.552 --> 29:34.183
They didn"t leave you some
huge trust fund or anything?

29:34.207 --> 29:35.967
A trust fund

29:35.991 --> 29:36.968
I don"t know.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.274
No, my parents were basically

29:38.298 --> 29:40.798
like the Bonnie and
Clyde of tax evasion.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.539
They opened up a bunch of
credit cards in my name,

29:42.563 --> 29:43.845
left me with all this debt.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.194
So yeah, they raised me but then

29:45.218 --> 29:46.543
somebody else sent me the bill.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.414
Well, how"d you then
open up a business

29:48.438 --> 29:49.459
and land on your feet?

29:49.483 --> 29:50.677
I worked a ton of jobs,

29:50.701 --> 29:52.767
I served a thousand
beers at Beer Land,

29:52.791 --> 29:54.725
worked the door at Mohawk,

29:54.749 --> 29:57.206
temped, parked cars at a rodeo.

29:57.230 --> 30:00.122
I actually was the
cashier at the salon

30:00.146 --> 30:01.386
and then they were closing down

30:01.410 --> 30:04.387
and I got my license,
took over the lease,

30:04.411 --> 30:06.065
paid for itself for a while.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.045
What?

30:10.069 --> 30:13.681
I just... I find
you fascinating.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.555
That"s a word.

30:19.426 --> 30:21.645
That is the F-word.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.695
It must be horrible
to lose this.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.631
Yeah.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.093
It"ll probably be a condo
by the end of the month.

30:38.184 --> 30:40.839
You ready? Yeah.

30:55.201 --> 30:57.246
Hi.

31:03.818 --> 31:06.516
No.

31:29.365 --> 31:30.734
Zoe? Yeah?

31:30.758 --> 31:32.736
Zoe! Oh, hi!

31:32.760 --> 31:36.392
Hi, I"m so happy you came!

31:36.416 --> 31:37.393
Of course.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.177
I have something for you.

31:39.201 --> 31:40.744
For me? Look!

31:40.768 --> 31:43.834
Oh, great! Do you want
to feel him kick?

31:43.858 --> 31:45.531
No. Come on.

31:45.555 --> 31:47.098
It is a joy. No.

31:47.122 --> 31:49.100
To feel him kick, I must say.

31:49.124 --> 31:51.146
No, no, I do not.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.147
No? I do not...

31:52.171 --> 31:55.324
Want to feel the kick.

31:55.348 --> 31:59.415
Fine, maybe we can put
your present over here

31:59.439 --> 32:02.722
along with the
non-registry gifts.

32:02.746 --> 32:06.465
It"s okay, all the single
people bring baskets.

32:06.489 --> 32:07.902
Oh, Zoe! Hi!

32:07.926 --> 32:09.840
Brought you a juice.
Oh, thank you.

32:10.667 --> 32:11.775
Where"s the bar?

32:11.799 --> 32:14.299
Oh, there"s a juice
bar over there

32:14.323 --> 32:16.258
and an oxygen bar in the back.

32:16.282 --> 32:17.922
I don"t wanna take too
much because I have

32:17.946 --> 32:21.350
a roller derby match tonight,
and it"s my first one.

32:21.374 --> 32:22.694
I"m trying to come
up with a name.

32:22.718 --> 32:25.006
I was like, the
Penetrator, you know.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.486
Or like, Nipple Clamper LANA:
Oh, no, I don"t like that one.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.053
I want something aggressive.

32:29.077 --> 32:30.968
So there"s no alcohol?
No alcohol?

32:30.992 --> 32:33.623
No, Zoe, it"s 11:30
in the morning.

32:33.647 --> 32:36.147
Well, it"s past 10:00, you
know, all bets are off.

32:36.171 --> 32:39.629
You ever had a carbon
monoxide shot?

32:39.653 --> 32:42.458
You should go in the garage
and turn the car on.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.199
What? Yeah, all the
kids are doing it,

32:44.223 --> 32:46.183
don"t stay in there too
long "cause you could die.

32:46.207 --> 32:49.682
But just turn the car on
for like, 30 seconds.

32:49.706 --> 32:53.121
It"s the same effect as alcohol.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.079
Anyway, this is a great party.

32:55.103 --> 32:57.081
I love kids.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.953
All right, we"ll see
you at the oxygen bar.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.824
I"ll see you at the...

33:00.848 --> 33:03.448
I actually will just breathe the
air that"s right here, thank you.

33:06.723 --> 33:08.638
Don"t judge me, little kids.

33:15.689 --> 33:18.494
Well, hello, friend. Hello.

33:18.518 --> 33:21.497
Somebody that I know,
that is older than five.

33:21.521 --> 33:23.455
Hi! Hi.

33:23.479 --> 33:26.154
So what were you up to
before this horrific

33:26.178 --> 33:28.547
shoot-myself-in-the-face
baby shower?

33:28.571 --> 33:30.245
Ah, I was doing very
exciting things.

33:30.269 --> 33:33.074
I was blowing up balloons,
I was unstacking chairs.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.553
Hard labor, basically.

33:34.577 --> 33:35.815
Sounds like a blast.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.687
You have kids? Nah.

33:37.711 --> 33:39.210
Oh. Do I look like I have kids?

33:39.234 --> 33:41.062
No. Okay.

33:41.889 --> 33:42.997
Guess what? Hmm?

33:43.021 --> 33:45.066
Your son is biting party guests.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.914
Our son thinks he"s a dog.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.264
It"s a phase.

33:49.288 --> 33:50.376
It"s a phase.

33:52.682 --> 33:55.096
Be right back. Thank you.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.099
It"s actually a totally
normal, developmental stage.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.578
Oh, sure, yeah.
It actually means

33:59.602 --> 34:01.276
he has an above-average
imagination.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.712
So, maybe he"ll be an artist.

34:02.736 --> 34:03.930
I hope not.

34:03.954 --> 34:06.542
Well, I bark at
like half my dates.

34:06.566 --> 34:10.371
So, I totally understand.

34:10.396 --> 34:13.070
Yeah, don"t have kids,
that"s my tip for you.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.356
Way ahead of you.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.619
God, I hate myself.

34:19.969 --> 34:21.014
Hello.

34:22.755 --> 34:24.409
What's you all nameses?

34:26.150 --> 34:28.694
I see how this is going.

34:28.717 --> 34:31.045
You know the first boy that ever
broke my heart had red hair.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.177
He ended up cutting off a lock of
his hair and mailing it to me.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.841
I still have it in this
trunk at my house.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.092
I wonder what he"s doing?

34:36.117 --> 34:37.616
Do you guys have Facebook?

34:37.639 --> 34:38.920
So which one of you do you think

34:38.944 --> 34:40.380
will lose your virginity first?

34:41.731 --> 34:42.993
It"s a fair question.

34:44.690 --> 34:45.842
June, Cam...

34:45.866 --> 34:48.366
Sorry, Cameron,
June, this is Zoe.

34:48.389 --> 34:50.262
Zoe, these are my girls.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.936
You have three kids.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.222
That I do, Zoe.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.486
That I do.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.236
What"s your name again? Sam.

35:15.200 --> 35:19.093
I want to welcome
everybody to Oral 101.

35:19.117 --> 35:23.009
I am Sarah-Beth and I suck!

35:23.033 --> 35:25.186
Seriously, Claire?

35:25.210 --> 35:27.013
What, I saw it on Groupon.

35:27.037 --> 35:29.668
You bought a dick-sucking
class on Groupon?

35:29.692 --> 35:33.281
So today you"re gonna
learn how to GBB,

35:33.305 --> 35:35.848
Give Better Blowjobs.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.312
You told me that
this was going to be

35:37.336 --> 35:39.591
a cooking exhibition to
make homemade Pop-Tarts.

35:39.615 --> 35:42.531
Surprise! Fuck you.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.772
He won"t. What?

35:46.796 --> 35:47.904
Fuck me.

35:47.928 --> 35:52.561
And it is actually an
amazing exfoliant.

35:52.585 --> 35:55.085
My fiance won"t have sex with me

35:55.109 --> 35:57.609
unless I have Bush on my face.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.655
That"s what the masks were for?

35:59.679 --> 36:02.397
And just put it on
your face like this

36:02.421 --> 36:07.010
and I swear your face
has never been softer.

36:07.034 --> 36:10.013
So when you have the
penis in your mouth,

36:10.037 --> 36:11.754
you wanna treat it
like a pepper grinder.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.388
Now, twist it!

36:14.346 --> 36:15.584
Twist it!

36:15.608 --> 36:16.715
Put some pepper on it!

36:16.739 --> 36:18.630
It"s all in the wrist.

36:18.654 --> 36:19.849
That"s nice.

36:19.873 --> 36:23.157
Every penis has its
own personality.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.986
Some dicks are just
like a nice, simple guy

36:27.010 --> 36:28.901
that"s tellin' you he
likes your blouse.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.860
Other dicks are a little feisty.

36:30.884 --> 36:33.254
You can get a good sense of
what a dick"s gonna be like

36:33.278 --> 36:34.472
when you see it.

36:34.496 --> 36:35.995
If he"s all doin' this at first,

36:36.019 --> 36:38.911
you"re like, "Yeah,
that"s a feisty dick!"

36:38.935 --> 36:41.349
And there"s nothing a guy likes

36:41.373 --> 36:43.089
more than getting compliments.

36:43.113 --> 36:44.395
Okay, so watch this.

36:44.419 --> 36:47.703
You have the most beautiful eyes

36:47.727 --> 36:50.880
of anyone I have ever seen.

36:50.904 --> 36:53.622
So everybody, pick
your penises up.

36:53.646 --> 36:56.233
On the count of three
you"re gonna put the penis,

36:56.257 --> 36:58.061
cucumber, in your mouth.

36:58.085 --> 37:01.630
Okay, one, two, three.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.438
You"re so sexy.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.374
You"re so loyal.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.095
You"re so loyal?

37:09.096 --> 37:10.813
Good try. A for effort.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.336
But a guy does not want to hear

37:12.360 --> 37:14.686
how he"s loyal in a blowjob.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.558
You need to say something like,

37:16.582 --> 37:20.344
"This is the biggest dick I
have ever put in my mouth.

37:20.368 --> 37:21.911
"It is so huge,

37:21.935 --> 37:24.740
"I"ve only thrown up
on you five times."

37:24.764 --> 37:26.089
All right, small mouth, come up.

37:26.113 --> 37:28.874
How does this keep
happening to me?

37:28.898 --> 37:31.529
Zoe, Zoe! Shh.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.575
Come over here, Zoe.

37:33.599 --> 37:35.122
All right, pull up your penis.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.231
There we go, okay.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.669
So, just imagine a
penis just like,

37:40.693 --> 37:42.845
"Oh, my God, I love this."

37:42.869 --> 37:45.456
"Oh, I want to put my
wiener all over your face"

37:45.480 --> 37:47.080
"and in your mouth,
put it in your nose,"

37:47.104 --> 37:49.024
"and in your eye, and in
your cheek, everywhere."

37:49.048 --> 37:50.602
"Just take it, just
take it, take it."

37:54.141 --> 37:56.012
Uh, I wouldn"t suggest...

37:57.362 --> 37:59.189
Breaking it in half.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.307
Hey, Jane!

38:10.331 --> 38:12.028
Well, hi, Nathan.

38:15.510 --> 38:18.228
Oh, sorry, he does
that to everyone.

38:18.252 --> 38:21.405
We didn"t see you at the Toddler
Meditation sailboat last week.

38:21.429 --> 38:23.886
You know Nathan would
just love that.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.350
I"m running a workshop
on how to make

38:25.374 --> 38:27.542
your own kale chips
this Thursday, okay?

38:27.566 --> 38:29.394
So, I"ll put you
on the list, okay?

38:29.872 --> 38:31.241
There you are!

38:31.265 --> 38:32.808
Jane, we were starting to think

38:32.832 --> 38:34.810
that you guys had moved away.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.942
You know I"m doing a Mothers
Against Litter sign up

38:36.966 --> 38:38.248
to clean up the park.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.771
Paul"s already on the list.

38:39.795 --> 38:41.860
He is really fantastic
with the kids.

38:41.884 --> 38:43.732
You are so lucky!

38:58.640 --> 39:01.251
What, you have to pee?
Okay, come on.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.498
Mom, we"re hungry. Dad,
can we have dinner?

39:10.522 --> 39:12.238
Yeah, I"ll order us a pizza.

39:12.262 --> 39:14.328
No, I can make
something in a minute.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.527
Can you walk your brother?

39:23.926 --> 39:25.687
Who is that?

39:25.711 --> 39:29.541
Lana, she"s really upset
about the pregnancy.

39:30.890 --> 39:32.563
You know, I should
go over there.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.284
Why don"t you order
that pizza thing?

39:34.981 --> 39:36.025
Okay.

40:12.366 --> 40:13.604
Hello?

40:16.762 --> 40:18.024
Oh, my God.

40:18.503 --> 40:19.504
Okay.

40:20.548 --> 40:23.159
Yes. Thank you for calling.

40:24.857 --> 40:27.966
Ah, guys, the school called

40:27.990 --> 40:32.797
and it seems that
your class has lice.

40:32.821 --> 40:35.017
No, no, no, no, no.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.671
We don"t scream. Sit
down, sit down.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.020
I"m gonna take a look at you.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.109
Everyone just calm down.

40:40.133 --> 40:42.416
I"m sure everything is fine.

40:42.440 --> 40:46.028
We "re just... You know, we"
re gonna deal with this, okay?

40:46.052 --> 40:48.378
The important thing
is we don"t...

40:48.402 --> 40:49.771
Oh, fuck!

40:49.795 --> 40:51.753
Oh, my God!

40:52.406 --> 40:53.644
Oh, my God.

40:53.668 --> 40:56.430
I"m sorry for using that word.

40:56.454 --> 40:57.866
It was knee-jerk.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.563
Uh...

40:59.587 --> 41:01.260
We"re gonna kill them all.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.416
Daddy"s gonna kill them all.

41:03.046 --> 41:04.046
We"ll be fine.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.526
You"ll be fine.

41:05.550 --> 41:06.725
We"ll be okay.

41:08.553 --> 41:10.076
Here we go.

41:10.859 --> 41:12.252
Here we go.

42:29.721 --> 42:30.939
What did I do?

42:33.289 --> 42:35.354
Nothing, you"re great.

42:35.378 --> 42:36.921
You"re great.

42:36.945 --> 42:39.948
It"s just something that
happens to me these days.

42:41.254 --> 42:42.536
I"m just obsessing.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.928
I "m obsessing It" s okay.

42:43.952 --> 42:45.563
I "m obsessing. It" s okay.

42:54.659 --> 42:57.705
It"s just so hard to be alone.

42:59.620 --> 43:01.753
Especially when
you"re with someone.

43:05.495 --> 43:09.195
Uh... I can... I can hold you.

43:12.198 --> 43:14.940
For an extra $200.

43:24.210 --> 43:26.386
Hey.

43:26.821 --> 43:28.059
Hey.

43:28.083 --> 43:29.763
Where you been? I called
you like 10 times.

43:30.216 --> 43:31.497
My phone died.

43:31.521 --> 43:34.263
Okay, don"t freak out.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.895
Maybe we should send
them to private school.

43:37.919 --> 43:40.463
You think lice don"t
infect spoiled rich kids?

43:40.487 --> 43:41.662
Probably not.

43:50.279 --> 43:51.803
Have you slept with anyone yet?

43:54.762 --> 43:56.000
You told me not to tell you.

43:56.024 --> 43:59.090
Yeah, no, I know, I"m
sorry, never mind.

43:59.114 --> 44:01.551
But no, I haven"t.

44:06.078 --> 44:07.078
Come here.

44:16.915 --> 44:18.003
I love you.

44:20.832 --> 44:21.832
I know.

44:29.231 --> 44:31.949
Okay, All right.

44:31.973 --> 44:33.298
Paul, stop. Why?

44:33.322 --> 44:35.387
Seriously, stop. What.

44:35.411 --> 44:37.413
We have to wash this out.

45:05.485 --> 45:07.071
All right, full disclosure.

45:07.095 --> 45:09.770
I pretty much survive on
food truck meals alone.

45:09.794 --> 45:12.250
So you"re talking to an expert here.
You can trust me.

45:12.274 --> 45:14.513
I trust you. Thank you.

45:14.537 --> 45:16.515
Do you realize how
badass these guys are?

45:16.539 --> 45:18.561
I mean, no one can
afford a lease anymore.

45:18.585 --> 45:21.477
So they"re like, "Screw it, we"re gonna
open a business on our own terms,

45:21.501 --> 45:25.263
"no one to answer to, and we get to
do what we love day in and day out."

45:25.287 --> 45:26.917
Plus, these tacos are no joke.

45:26.941 --> 45:29.311
Okay, well, you"re talking to
somebody with extraordinarily

45:29.335 --> 45:31.792
high taco standards,
just to be clear.

45:31.816 --> 45:33.184
Okay. I"m not easily impressed.

45:33.208 --> 45:36.405
Okay, so we"re meeting
in the same place here.

45:36.429 --> 45:38.755
Mmm-hmm. And...

45:38.779 --> 45:40.539
Close your eyes and
open your mouth.

45:40.563 --> 45:41.923
I"m not falling for
that one again.

45:41.947 --> 45:44.500
Come on, man, it"s
taco roulette.

45:44.524 --> 45:47.242
You gotta trust me, I have
honorable intentions, I swear.

45:47.266 --> 45:49.094
Okay. All right.

45:51.705 --> 45:53.204
This is very vulnerable for me.

45:53.228 --> 45:54.577
Shh.

45:55.448 --> 45:56.754
So your mouth is ready.

45:59.060 --> 46:01.280
Okay. It"s close, it's close.

46:05.023 --> 46:08.132
Okay, oh. Chew it down.

46:08.156 --> 46:10.047
This is really good.
It"s really good, right?

46:10.071 --> 46:11.266
Who knows his tacos?

46:11.290 --> 46:12.639
You know your tacos.

46:14.467 --> 46:16.208
Come on, there you got it.

46:20.995 --> 46:23.365
Well, I met somebody.

46:23.389 --> 46:27.717
Someone I actually like, and he
"s perfect, and he" s married.

46:27.741 --> 46:29.023
Unhappily.

46:29.047 --> 46:32.548
Well, that"s new and
better than happily.

46:32.572 --> 46:33.549
You know what your problem is?

46:33.573 --> 46:35.464
Um, yeah, which one?

46:35.488 --> 46:37.422
You see everyone around
you settling down

46:37.446 --> 46:40.425
and it makes you want to
rev up and give hand jobs

46:40.449 --> 46:42.166
to weird dudes in public.

46:42.190 --> 46:45.213
Wow, you really have a way of making
things sound worse than they are.

46:45.237 --> 46:47.998
Really? "Cause you're
sleeping with a married guy"

46:48.022 --> 46:50.182
and watching your business
fail right before your eyes.

46:50.206 --> 46:51.872
I haven"t actually
slept with him

46:51.896 --> 46:53.830
and what am I supposed
to do about my store?

46:53.854 --> 46:55.223
It"s out of my hands.

46:55.247 --> 46:57.573
I "m sorry, you haven"
t slept with him?

46:57.597 --> 46:59.705
Well, that"s different.

46:59.729 --> 47:01.055
Shut up.

47:01.079 --> 47:03.666
Look, if that"s what
you want, go for it.

47:03.690 --> 47:05.146
If the store is what you want,

47:05.170 --> 47:06.887
stop being complacent, okay?

47:06.911 --> 47:08.366
We"ll figure something out.

47:08.390 --> 47:09.672
Or we"ll die.

47:09.696 --> 47:12.394
But either way, it"s
gonna be over soon.

47:13.221 --> 47:14.416
I"ll drink to that.

47:14.440 --> 47:15.876
Cheers.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.987
I"m kinda getting
high from the fumes.

47:20.011 --> 47:21.447
That"s why we come here.

47:21.795 --> 47:22.795
Right.

47:24.276 --> 47:25.276
Paul?

47:31.370 --> 47:33.609
Hi. What are you doing here?

47:33.633 --> 47:34.566
You forgot your keys.

47:34.590 --> 47:36.220
What is this place?

47:36.244 --> 47:39.528
Ah, it"s just a place I hang
out sometimes, you know?

47:39.552 --> 47:40.727
Watch movies.

47:42.076 --> 47:43.076
You"re drinking?

47:44.383 --> 47:46.448
No, it"s a friend's.

47:46.472 --> 47:47.797
You don"t have friends.

47:47.821 --> 47:51.259
Thanks, I do occasionally...
Have friends.

47:53.740 --> 47:56.786
Okay, so what, you come
here and you watch...

47:58.876 --> 48:00.505
You watch Working Girl?

48:00.529 --> 48:02.116
Why are you watching
Working Girl?

48:02.140 --> 48:04.380
You only watch Working Girl
when you"re feeling defeated.

48:09.582 --> 48:12.474
You wanna hang out for a bit?

48:12.498 --> 48:13.673
Watch Working Girl?

48:15.457 --> 48:16.806
I can "t. I don" t have time.

48:17.851 --> 48:19.722
Yeah.

48:20.462 --> 48:21.637
Thanks for the keys.

48:22.856 --> 48:25.424
See you at home. Yeah,
see you at home.

48:44.965 --> 48:46.725
Hello. Hello.

48:46.749 --> 48:48.075
What are you doing?

48:48.099 --> 48:50.991
I am tracing my own hand.

48:51.015 --> 48:53.950
Okay, well, a few of us are
going to a bar down the street

48:53.974 --> 48:55.343
if you would like to join us.

48:55.367 --> 48:58.346
And by a few of us I
mean, there is no us,

48:58.370 --> 48:59.869
it"s just me, alone.

48:59.893 --> 49:01.573
But there will be people
in the background.

49:01.597 --> 49:02.785
So, it should be fun.

49:02.809 --> 49:06.354
I would, and thanks for the
invitation but I"m sober.

49:06.378 --> 49:07.964
Oh, perfect, I"m an enabler.

49:07.988 --> 49:10.010
So, this is great.

49:10.034 --> 49:12.099
Rain check? Aw, come on.

49:12.123 --> 49:14.492
It"ll be fun. Right?

49:14.516 --> 49:16.277
Question mark,
exclamation point.

49:16.301 --> 49:20.498
Another exclamation point,
dot, dot, dot, dot...

49:20.522 --> 49:22.065
Okay, I"ll go if you
stop doing that.

49:22.089 --> 49:24.241
Deal. Period.

49:24.265 --> 49:27.679
So are you sober or
are you an alcoholic?

49:27.703 --> 49:29.768
Well, I"m definitely sober.

49:29.792 --> 49:31.596
Not sure if I"m an alcoholic.

49:31.620 --> 49:34.599
But my wife is sure.

49:34.623 --> 49:36.253
Cool. Yeah.

49:36.277 --> 49:38.516
So how bad of an alcoholic
are we talking?

49:38.540 --> 49:39.822
Do you, like, chug Listerine?

49:39.846 --> 49:41.606
Do you keep gasoline
underneath your bed?

49:41.630 --> 49:43.782
No, I was, like, old-school.

49:43.806 --> 49:46.089
I just drank all
the human stuff.

49:46.113 --> 49:49.136
But, like... Like a lot of it.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.573
I like a man who can commit
to something.Mmm-hmm.

49:51.597 --> 49:53.317
Does this mean you got
like an intervention?

49:53.341 --> 49:55.272
Did people come and read
you letters and cry?

49:55.296 --> 49:58.580
No, but that sounds amazing
and I would"ve loved one.

49:58.604 --> 50:00.103
What happened to
me was I got into

50:00.127 --> 50:02.062
into a really awesome
car accident.

50:02.086 --> 50:03.933
Cool. Yeah.

50:03.957 --> 50:05.500
You didn"t hit anybody, did you?

50:05.524 --> 50:07.676
I did, a parking meter.

50:07.700 --> 50:08.851
He didn"t make it.

50:08.875 --> 50:11.332
Oh, no. It was fine.

50:11.356 --> 50:13.116
He was kind of a
jerk parking meter.

50:13.140 --> 50:16.622
No, Jane, uh... Jane
gave me a choice.

50:17.231 --> 50:19.842
Her or Scotch.

50:20.626 --> 50:22.604
And I chose her.

50:22.628 --> 50:24.345
Well, I choose Scotch.

50:24.369 --> 50:27.609
And beer, and anything else
I can get my mouth around.

50:27.633 --> 50:30.177
I did not say... I didn"t
mean it like that.

50:30.201 --> 50:32.482
It doesn"t bother you if I drink
in front of you, does it?

50:32.506 --> 50:36.009
No, no, no, other people drinking doesn"t
bother me as much as, you know, me not.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.619
Which still annoys me.

50:37.643 --> 50:41.212
Well, you seem to be handling
yourself quite nicely, you know?

50:42.996 --> 50:44.519
Something right there.

50:48.958 --> 50:50.395
Ow! Sorry.

50:56.270 --> 50:57.271
Fuck!

50:59.578 --> 51:01.362
I"m gonna worry
about this later.

51:06.933 --> 51:09.196
So that happened. Yep.

51:10.502 --> 51:12.069
I"m in your bed.

51:12.765 --> 51:14.308
Your joint bed.

51:14.332 --> 51:17.267
You are married, you have a wife.
You know, your wife, Jane.

51:17.291 --> 51:18.573
Where is Jane?

51:18.597 --> 51:21.880
She"s gone for the
night with the kids.

51:21.904 --> 51:23.428
Oh, my God.

51:25.212 --> 51:28.496
Jane told me I could
have an affair.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.565
So, I"m the affair?

51:31.914 --> 51:34.265
Well, yeah, I guess.

51:35.092 --> 51:37.026
Oh, my God.

51:37.050 --> 51:39.028
Is that why you"ve been
hanging out with me?

51:39.052 --> 51:40.595
Was so you could bait me?

51:40.619 --> 51:43.230
So you could sleep with me?
So I can be your... Zoe, Zoe.

51:43.796 --> 51:46.035
I like you.

51:46.059 --> 51:48.690
You have no idea how
much I like you.

51:48.714 --> 51:50.474
Oh, my God.

51:50.498 --> 51:52.587
We"re bad people. No.

51:53.588 --> 51:56.132
We"re good people.

51:56.156 --> 51:58.463
We"re just failing
at it right now.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.877
Just...

52:01.901 --> 52:03.618
I mean, we take the
same antidepressants.

52:03.642 --> 52:05.837
I mean, that should
count for something.

52:05.861 --> 52:07.733
Yeah, that"s the spirit.

52:09.343 --> 52:15.238
Listen, my life is, like,
super complicated right now.

52:15.262 --> 52:17.960
I have no idea what"s
happening with my marriage.

52:19.440 --> 52:23.681
But my kids, I mean,
they"re everything.

52:23.705 --> 52:27.231
They "re the only thing I" ve
ever done right in my whole life.

52:29.929 --> 52:31.887
Come here, come on.

52:32.714 --> 52:34.238
We"ll figure it out.

52:35.369 --> 52:37.589
Everything"s gonna be okay.

52:39.678 --> 52:41.332
For somebody.

53:13.059 --> 53:15.559
It was too low.

53:15.583 --> 53:17.455
I knew this would happen.

53:22.329 --> 53:24.264
Let me do it. It was my fault.
I have it.

53:24.288 --> 53:25.808
Leave it. Leave it! I got it.
I got it.

53:25.832 --> 53:27.225
Leave it! I"ll do it!

53:43.785 --> 53:46.179
Hi.

53:47.485 --> 53:49.289
Jane, hi.

53:49.313 --> 53:51.595
I didn"t even know
you worked here.

53:51.619 --> 53:53.293
You didn"t?

53:53.317 --> 53:55.556
No, Laser Town is packed.

53:55.580 --> 53:59.081
I just came over for a...
For a wax.

53:59.105 --> 54:01.649
Oh, great.

54:01.673 --> 54:05.087
What were you thinking of doing?

54:05.111 --> 54:06.828
Brazilian? Cool, I do that.

54:06.852 --> 54:10.048
I do that. Okay.

54:10.072 --> 54:12.877
Unless, of course, you wouldn"t
feel comfortable with...

54:12.901 --> 54:14.879
Oh, no, you"re a professional.

54:14.903 --> 54:20.494
So, I... I am
completely comfortable.

54:20.518 --> 54:22.539
Great, why don"t you
just go back there,

54:22.563 --> 54:25.499
make yourself comfortable
and I"ll be right in.

54:25.523 --> 54:26.567
Okay.

54:38.275 --> 54:42.211
All right, Jane, if you could spread
your legs in a frog-like position.

54:42.235 --> 54:44.150
Like... Like this?

54:45.194 --> 54:47.042
Excellent, thanks.

54:47.066 --> 54:49.131
So how have you been doing?

54:49.155 --> 54:50.374
Good.

54:51.462 --> 54:53.657
I heard you went by the store.

54:53.681 --> 54:58.096
Yes, I did. I"ve
gone by the store.

54:58.120 --> 55:00.838
You know, I go by... I
go by all those stores.

55:00.862 --> 55:03.648
Yeah, Paul"s having a really
hard time letting go of it.

55:05.214 --> 55:06.757
Sorry.

55:06.781 --> 55:08.941
All right, now you can go
ahead and pull your legs back

55:08.965 --> 55:11.228
as far as you can,
excellent, yes.

55:12.918 --> 55:14.485
You ever been married?

55:15.660 --> 55:20.118
No, no, not yet.

55:20.142 --> 55:23.078
You heard Lana and Peter are
already having trouble, right?

55:23.102 --> 55:24.799
No, I had not heard that.

55:27.280 --> 55:30.280
All right, Jane, you can go ahead and
lie down on your side, this direction.

55:33.417 --> 55:36.134
Yeah, apparently he"s
been cheating on her.

55:36.158 --> 55:38.398
Oh, you know, I...

55:38.422 --> 55:42.315
You know, I guess that"s
something that people do.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.969
All right, Jane, now
this is something fun,

55:44.993 --> 55:46.713
I never thought I would
be asking you to do.

55:46.737 --> 55:49.409
But could you spread
your right butt cheek?

55:49.433 --> 55:50.433
Excellent.

55:52.871 --> 55:54.239
Wait, is it the wax?

55:54.263 --> 55:57.068
No, I"m just having
a panic attack.

55:57.092 --> 55:59.375
Oh, I have those all the time,

55:59.399 --> 56:00.679
it"s a repetitive
sound disorder.

56:00.703 --> 56:03.118
Maybe that"s... Is it the sound?

56:03.142 --> 56:05.710
No, it"s fine, I'm breathing.

56:07.320 --> 56:09.472
This is breathing and
it means I"m not dying.

56:09.496 --> 56:11.696
Okay, are you sure? Can I get
you something, some water?

56:11.720 --> 56:13.041
No. A Xanax?

56:13.065 --> 56:15.217
It"ll help the water
go down easier.

56:15.241 --> 56:17.132
No, it"s just something
that happens lately.

56:17.156 --> 56:20.309
I spontaneously start crying.

56:20.333 --> 56:22.442
It"s like I have a
disease or something.

56:22.466 --> 56:24.487
No, you"re okay.

56:24.511 --> 56:26.968
How do you know that?

56:26.992 --> 56:29.579
I guess it"s just something
that people say.

56:29.603 --> 56:31.320
But I "m sure it" s
true occasionally.

56:31.344 --> 56:34.976
Zoe? Yeah?

56:35.000 --> 56:38.240
Can you just finish waxing
my asshole so I can go?

56:38.264 --> 56:39.744
Of course.

57:09.643 --> 57:12.187
Mazel Tov.

57:12.211 --> 57:14.450
I just want to say thank you
to everybody for coming.

57:14.474 --> 57:17.192
This is has been the
most successful bris.

57:17.216 --> 57:18.846
Well, that"s subjective.

57:18.870 --> 57:21.239
Thank you for having us.

57:21.263 --> 57:22.613
It"s been lovely.

57:27.748 --> 57:29.117
Are you gonna get him?

57:29.141 --> 57:33.730
No, no. We are practicing
the "Cry It Out" method.

57:33.754 --> 57:37.081
So, it is agony.

57:37.105 --> 57:39.562
But it is better for
him in the long run.

57:39.586 --> 57:42.086
Oh, actually they"ve
just proven that

57:42.110 --> 57:44.132
lack of emotional support
when you"re young

57:44.156 --> 57:46.439
can have a real damaging
effect later in life.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.353
So, it"s all over the blogs.

57:48.377 --> 57:49.964
Our son eats off the floor.

57:49.988 --> 57:52.619
No, really, he chews bones

57:52.643 --> 57:55.317
and the other day we found him
drinking water out of the toilet.

57:55.341 --> 57:57.972
So, anything that Jane
says about parenting

57:57.996 --> 57:59.930
you should, you know,
do the opposite.

57:59.954 --> 58:02.803
This flatware is lovely.

58:02.827 --> 58:04.152
Thank you. Yeah.

58:04.176 --> 58:05.588
You know, I actually from...

58:05.612 --> 58:07.068
Because you"re father of
the fucking year, right?

58:07.092 --> 58:09.418
No, I"m sorry. I'm sorry
that I make all the money

58:09.442 --> 58:11.115
and I take care
of our three kids

58:11.139 --> 58:13.466
and I have my parents bail
us out of bankruptcy.

58:13.490 --> 58:16.294
You"re right, I'm just a terrible
mom and a terrible wife.

58:16.318 --> 58:17.905
I paid for that money, Jane.

58:17.929 --> 58:19.776
Trust me, I fucking paid for it.

58:19.800 --> 58:22.240
How"s that wine treating you, Sweetie?
It"s delicious, thanks.

58:22.264 --> 58:23.563
Would you pass the...

58:23.587 --> 58:24.607
Hey, look, everyone.

58:24.631 --> 58:26.087
Now it"s all out in the open.

58:26.111 --> 58:29.525
Look, everybody,
Jane is a smoker.

58:29.549 --> 58:31.962
See, now everybody knows
and nobody cares.

58:31.986 --> 58:34.530
You"re right I'm a terrible,
terrible human being,

58:34.554 --> 58:37.315
because sometimes I
have a cigarette.

58:37.339 --> 58:39.013
Right.

58:39.037 --> 58:40.144
Uh...

58:40.168 --> 58:41.929
There, you win!

58:41.953 --> 58:43.365
Okay? You win!

58:43.389 --> 58:46.150
If winning mean losing
your job, getting a DUI,

58:46.174 --> 58:47.891
and bringing nothing
to the table sexually.

58:47.915 --> 58:49.850
I mean, you think I
just wanna roll over

58:49.874 --> 58:52.809
and get fucked the exact same
way for the rest of my life?

58:52.833 --> 58:55.725
"It is Groundhog Day! My
vagina is fuckin" Bill Murray!

58:55.749 --> 58:58.815
Aw, I love Bill Murray.

58:58.839 --> 59:00.469
You"re embarrassing yourself.

59:00.493 --> 59:03.211
You know what? You"ve been
embarrassing me our entire marriage!

59:03.235 --> 59:04.475
Jane, can I get you an ashtray?

59:04.499 --> 59:06.040
No, it"s fine. No?

59:06.064 --> 59:08.066
Thank you, have a great bris.

59:11.939 --> 59:16.093
Well, I have never
been to a bris before.

59:16.117 --> 59:17.858
But this is great.

59:23.081 --> 59:24.648
Zoe. Whoo.

59:25.866 --> 59:27.844
Zoe, do you think
I can"t see you?

59:27.868 --> 59:31.239
Oh, I"m sorry, I just really need
my face in my hair right now.

59:31.263 --> 59:32.543
You mean your hair in your face?

59:32.567 --> 59:36.505
I mean my hair in my face, Paul.

59:36.529 --> 59:38.899
Hi. Hi. You okay?

59:38.923 --> 59:41.162
Yeah, I"m actually...
Are you kidding me?

59:41.186 --> 59:43.860
I signed up for life
classes through Oprah,

59:43.884 --> 59:46.080
because she does that and
then I got corn tortillas

59:46.104 --> 59:48.304
instead of flour because I
heard that was better for you

59:48.328 --> 59:50.069
and I, I...

59:50.456 --> 59:51.912
Fuck, I"m doing awesome.

59:51.936 --> 59:54.591
Okay, listen, I"m
really sorry, um...

59:55.766 --> 59:57.352
I"m really sorry
about what happened.

59:57.376 --> 59:59.746
I"m not sorry that it happened.
I just...

59:59.770 --> 01:00:02.009
I suck at words.

01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:04.272
I"m so much better at mixed CDs.

01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:07.057
Yeah, me, too.

01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:10.694
I just, I REO Speedwagon
Can"t Fight This Feeling.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:15.631
Paul, you can"t admit to
liking REO Speedwagon.

01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:17.851
It"s not even cool in an
ironic way like Tom Petty.

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:20.201
Yeah, Tom Petty is
not cool in any way.

01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:22.682
What are you... Are you
serious right now?

01:00:22.706 --> 01:00:25.598
Tom Petty is not cool? I
can"t, you know what?

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.687
No, I"m not doing this here.

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:30.551
I cannot argue with you about the
coolness of Tom Petty out in the open.

01:00:30.575 --> 01:00:31.817
It"s just way too intimate.

01:00:31.841 --> 01:00:34.563
Then come inside. I"m
not coming inside.

01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:36.870
This is... I can"t do this.

01:00:36.894 --> 01:00:37.895
It"s just...

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:01.005
He was an escort.

01:01:02.006 --> 01:01:04.051
The guy I was with.

01:01:05.444 --> 01:01:06.750
He was a what?

01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:11.295
He was a prostitute.

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:14.061
He was a fucking prostitute.

01:01:18.196 --> 01:01:20.111
You paid someone?

01:01:21.852 --> 01:01:23.941
You paid someone?

01:01:33.515 --> 01:01:35.039
How much did they charge?

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:50.141
Why is there an eviction
notice on your door?

01:01:52.926 --> 01:01:54.208
I don"t know.

01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:56.234
Zo, what"s wrong?

01:01:59.585 --> 01:02:01.345
I slept with Paul.

01:02:01.369 --> 01:02:03.458
Paul of Paul and Jane?

01:02:05.199 --> 01:02:07.874
I mean, it"s okay, you know?
People fuck people.

01:02:07.898 --> 01:02:11.442
I don"t know how this
is my life, you know?

01:02:11.466 --> 01:02:16.883
I worked so hard not
to be like my parents.

01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:18.711
Not to be a failure.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:21.975
I don"t want to lose
everything that I have.

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:25.065
Okay, what do people in this
town love more than anything?

01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:27.371
Tacos. More than tacos.

01:02:27.395 --> 01:02:28.395
Music.

01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:30.548
I have the bands,

01:02:30.572 --> 01:02:33.769
you have a pretty vacant
space with your store.

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:36.206
I say we charge a cover

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:38.861
and... I don"t know,
see what happens.

01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:40.515
You think that would work?

01:02:40.539 --> 01:02:42.933
I mean, we might as
well try, right?

01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:48.808
Sir, you! Ma"am!

01:03:05.912 --> 01:03:07.087
See this, Austin?

01:03:09.002 --> 01:03:11.048
We can"t find Nate.
Nathan"s missing.

01:03:19.491 --> 01:03:21.643
Hey, did you pay a cover?

01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:23.471
No, you can"t sneak in here.

01:03:23.495 --> 01:03:26.295
You need to go to the front and you
need to pay. CLAIRE: Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.

01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:26.909
Hey! Relax.

01:03:26.933 --> 01:03:29.129
This is going so great. I
have someone at the door.

01:03:29.153 --> 01:03:31.914
Oh, great. Yeah. Wait, you
wanna take a shot with me?

01:03:31.938 --> 01:03:35.526
No, and why don"t you
slow your roll, okay?

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.659
I"m having fun,
Claire, loosen up.

01:03:37.683 --> 01:03:39.052
This is going great.

01:03:39.076 --> 01:03:40.356
Why don"t we get you some water?

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.099
Okay, you look
like a total mess.

01:03:43.123 --> 01:03:44.579
Phew.

01:03:44.603 --> 01:03:45.734
Nathan!

01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:48.322
Come on, bud, Nate!

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:50.890
Did you find him? Yeah,
Jane, I found him.

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:52.880
"Just decided to stand
out here and continue

01:03:52.904 --> 01:03:54.894
calling his name like
a fuckin" idiot.

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:57.461
I "m sorry! It" s
not your fault.

01:03:57.485 --> 01:03:59.463
He does this all the
time, we"ll find him.

01:03:59.487 --> 01:04:01.770
Yes, it is, it"s my fault.

01:04:01.794 --> 01:04:04.207
Everything is fucking my fault!

01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:05.972
It was the both of us. Nate!

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:11.040
You know, that I get off
work and I come here,

01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:13.521
and I walk around the
block three or four times

01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:15.305
before I even come inside?

01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:16.480
Why.

01:04:16.504 --> 01:04:18.743
Because I can"t believe
that I am this.

01:04:18.767 --> 01:04:22.878
This wife, this mother, it
just doesn"t seem real.

01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:25.359
I never wanted to be one
of these fucking people.

01:04:25.383 --> 01:04:26.926
What people?

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:29.406
People who live just
to endure each other.

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:32.018
That"s everyone we know.
That"s marriage!

01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:33.410
It"s not!

01:04:33.434 --> 01:04:34.498
You think...

01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:36.979
You think I tried to
be a shitty wife?

01:04:37.003 --> 01:04:39.721
No, I tried! I tried
to do my best!

01:04:39.745 --> 01:04:42.506
I worked hard, I took
care of the bills,

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:45.553
I took care of the children. I
tried to be attracted to you.

01:04:45.577 --> 01:04:47.337
Wait, what?

01:04:47.361 --> 01:04:50.081
What do you... You tried to be attracted...
What does that even mean?

01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:55.108
Recently, the thought of having
sex with you just repulses me.

01:04:57.937 --> 01:04:59.025
Wow, this...

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:03.179
I"m just trying to
be honest for once.

01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:06.791
Yeah, your honesty, it"s just
another way for you to hurt people.

01:05:06.815 --> 01:05:10.230
Look at our house, nothing fits!

01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:13.474
You are buying furniture for a
house we don"t even live in!

01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:18.523
Nathan! Nathan!

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.439
Found him!

01:05:27.706 --> 01:05:31.449
Must be hard, being
this self-righteous.

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:34.408
You have no idea.

01:05:40.066 --> 01:05:42.068
Thank you so much for
coming out tonight!

01:05:43.722 --> 01:05:46.614
And giving a hands
up to Sailor Poon.

01:05:46.638 --> 01:05:48.311
Look at these ladies.

01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:51.619
And speaking of poon, let"s
not forget why we"re here.

01:05:51.643 --> 01:05:53.926
So that our poons can get waxed

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:57.625
by a local business
and not Laser Town,

01:05:57.649 --> 01:06:01.585
which is basically the
Illuminati of pubic hair.

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:03.449
Now tonight, we"re gonna
take back what"s ours!

01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:09.680
Let"s take it to the streets!

01:06:09.704 --> 01:06:11.402
Come on!

01:06:15.623 --> 01:06:17.993
They can"t break us.

01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:20.343
Ohh!

01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:22.476
Plexiglass, you gotta
be fucking kidding me.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.652
This just stupid...

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:26.349
Ohh!

01:06:26.373 --> 01:06:28.177
Damn it! Stupid!

01:06:28.201 --> 01:06:30.353
Ow! Fuck!

01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:32.640
Ow! Fuck!

01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:59.078
Thanks for bailing me out.

01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:01.689
The covers paid half
and the other half...

01:07:01.713 --> 01:07:03.082
I"ll pay you back, I promise.

01:07:03.106 --> 01:07:06.389
How, Zoe, how are you
gonna pay me back?

01:07:06.413 --> 01:07:07.912
You don"t have anything.

01:07:07.936 --> 01:07:09.610
Look, Claire, I"m sorry.

01:07:09.634 --> 01:07:12.265
I was wasted, I got
out of control.

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:14.484
Your parents spent
their whole lives

01:07:14.508 --> 01:07:16.119
running from where
you just were.

01:07:17.859 --> 01:07:21.622
Wow, that was a really low blow.

01:07:21.646 --> 01:07:24.451
God, Zoe, you need to grow up!

01:07:24.475 --> 01:07:26.409
Okay, so you didn"t win at life,

01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:28.150
you didn"t get some
grand fucking prize,

01:07:28.174 --> 01:07:30.935
no one does and no one
owes you anything.

01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:33.329
And, I mean, forget winning,
because how you lose

01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:35.244
is just as much a
part of who you are.

01:07:35.268 --> 01:07:38.054
And no offense, but you"re
kind of an asshole.

01:07:42.362 --> 01:07:45.539
You know what? Just
pay me back whenever.

01:09:27.337 --> 01:09:28.425
What"s up?

01:09:32.429 --> 01:09:34.711
What, did you rob a bank?

01:09:34.734 --> 01:09:36.345
I got my job back at Beer Land.

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:39.542
That"s oddly stable of you.

01:09:39.566 --> 01:09:42.979
I know that I suck
at relationships.

01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:47.246
And I"m full of shit,

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:50.205
and I act like I"m right
about everything,

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:56.951
because I am so fucking scared
to be wrong, all the time.

01:09:56.975 --> 01:10:01.260
But you"re my best friend and
I really, really do love you.

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:05.916
And I say that out
loud, like, never.

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.203
So...

01:10:09.727 --> 01:10:11.119
I love you.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.098
You"re being totally
emo right now.

01:10:14.122 --> 01:10:17.996
Yeah, I"m really trying to get
better at this emo stuff.

01:10:18.518 --> 01:10:20.453
Feels good.

01:10:20.477 --> 01:10:22.870
I caught Jim fucking his office.

01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:25.284
Like the wall?

01:10:25.308 --> 01:10:27.590
No, the people.

01:10:27.614 --> 01:10:29.201
And he didn"t even invite you?

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.575
Oh.

01:10:33.403 --> 01:10:34.491
You"re invited.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:44.694
Well, you can come to my
office fuck party anytime.

01:10:44.718 --> 01:10:47.330
I can"t believe our 5-year-old
needs to see a shrink.

01:10:48.374 --> 01:10:49.699
You think he"s okay?

01:10:49.723 --> 01:10:50.961
He"ll be fine.

01:10:50.985 --> 01:10:52.265
He probably loves the attention.

01:10:52.289 --> 01:10:54.791
I mean, do you think he is okay?

01:10:54.815 --> 01:10:57.949
Yes, I think he"s fine.

01:10:59.385 --> 01:11:00.385
Okay.

01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:07.959
You know, I"m really sorry about
the whole prostitution thing.

01:11:12.877 --> 01:11:15.401
It"s not funny.

01:11:16.228 --> 01:11:20.493
I mean, come on.

01:11:25.672 --> 01:11:27.607
I didn"t keep up.

01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:31.611
Wow, I can"t remember the last
time I"ve seen you laugh.

01:11:31.635 --> 01:11:33.985
Oh, my God, that"s depressing.

01:11:37.641 --> 01:11:39.860
I know this sounds
fucked up, but...

01:11:42.733 --> 01:11:45.866
If we were gonna fail, I"m really
glad that I failed with you.

01:11:51.785 --> 01:11:52.960
Good game.

01:11:53.657 --> 01:11:54.788
Good game.

01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:02.206
Oh, hey, buddy.

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:03.860
Hey, man. Hi.

01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:06.080
Oh, look at you. Oh, hello.

01:12:06.104 --> 01:12:07.908
Up on your knees.
You look taller.

01:12:07.932 --> 01:12:09.499
Look at that, he"s okay?

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.828
No. Blow it out, Zoe.

01:12:14.852 --> 01:12:16.177
Make a wish.

01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:17.613
I wish I wasn"t old.

01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:18.637
Like a viable wish.

01:12:19.247 --> 01:12:20.312
I wish I were dead.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:21.791
Or rich.

01:12:21.815 --> 01:12:23.895
You know what I actually wish?
I wish I were British?

01:12:23.919 --> 01:12:25.921
I think I"d be very
charming if I were British.

01:12:27.081 --> 01:12:30.626
Cheerio. It worked.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:31.584
No, it didn"t.

01:12:31.608 --> 01:12:33.499
God, I"m really bad at accents.

01:12:33.523 --> 01:12:35.786
You are, you actually
are really bad at it.

01:12:37.744 --> 01:12:40.201
I know this isn"t where you
imagined yourself at this age.

01:12:40.225 --> 01:12:43.117
You mean closing my
failing business, single?

01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:44.901
I don"t know, it
seems about right.

01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:47.034
Did you hear about
Peter and Lana?

01:12:47.058 --> 01:12:48.514
He filed for divorce.

01:12:48.538 --> 01:12:51.299
You got me bad news
for my birthday?

01:12:51.323 --> 01:12:53.736
You know I love other
people"s bad news.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:59.810
Speaking of, Paul and Jane,
while no longer Paul and Jane.

01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:03.920
Wow, really?

01:13:03.944 --> 01:13:05.269
You gonna hit that?

01:13:05.293 --> 01:13:07.054
No. Why?

01:13:07.078 --> 01:13:08.751
I think I"m gonna be celibate.

01:13:08.775 --> 01:13:10.623
Oh. That"ll last.

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:13.563
Uh, it will last. I
will be celibate.

01:14:39.344 --> 01:14:43.150
Hey. Nice sign.

01:14:43.174 --> 01:14:45.045
A little on the nose.

01:14:45.872 --> 01:14:48.198
I know.

01:14:48.222 --> 01:14:50.462
This is great, congrats.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.593
Thanks. It"s amazing.

01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:53.290
Thank you very much.

01:14:53.314 --> 01:14:55.641
You know, all my life, I"ve
anticipated failure so much

01:14:55.665 --> 01:14:58.078
it"s kind of bizarre when
it"s not actually happening.

01:14:58.102 --> 01:14:59.122
Mmm.

01:14:59.146 --> 01:15:00.974
Sounds nice, enjoy it.

01:15:02.193 --> 01:15:03.910
Hey, I heard about you and Jane.

01:15:03.934 --> 01:15:05.781
And I"m really sorry.

01:15:05.805 --> 01:15:07.372
"How you holdin" up?

01:15:08.939 --> 01:15:10.244
Oddly well.

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:12.745
That"s good to hear.

01:15:12.769 --> 01:15:13.857
Yeah, except for one thing.

01:15:14.422 --> 01:15:15.423
What?

01:15:16.816 --> 01:15:22.015
I keep trying to not
be in love with you.

01:15:22.039 --> 01:15:24.931
And it does not
seem to be working.

01:15:24.955 --> 01:15:27.847
Hmm, interesting turn
of events.Mmm-hmm.

01:15:27.871 --> 01:15:30.153
Let me just lay out
some ground rules.

01:15:30.177 --> 01:15:33.026
There"s gonna be no
sleeping together, no sex.

01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:35.768
I"m so sorry. Okay,
great, see you.

01:15:35.792 --> 01:15:36.812
All right.

01:15:36.836 --> 01:15:38.403
Come here.

01:15:44.409 --> 01:15:45.429
Hey.

01:15:45.453 --> 01:15:46.735
Yeah?

01:15:46.759 --> 01:15:49.129
I think I"m coming
around on Tom Petty.

01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:50.434
Okay, we can have sex.

01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:53.046
Let"s fuck. Oh, fantastic.

01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:55.551
The table"s very small
but it is full-service.

01:16:34.328 --> 01:16:36.785
No, wait, I have an idea.
No, wait, don"t leave me.

01:16:36.809 --> 01:16:38.918
No, I need to get this.
Don"t leave me.

01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:40.093
Come on. All right.

01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:41.771
Promise, this is gonna be good.

01:16:42.336 --> 01:16:43.990
One, two, three.

01:16:48.429 --> 01:16:50.799
Good one. Got it.

01:16:50.823 --> 01:16:52.453
Do this? No, no.

01:16:52.477 --> 01:16:54.020
I"ve seen people do this.

01:16:54.044 --> 01:16:55.480
Told you.

01:22:53.925 --> 01:22:58.862
My most memorable blowjobs
was with a celebrity.

01:22:58.886 --> 01:23:02.040
Oh, I try not to brag about
that too much, uh...

01:23:02.064 --> 01:23:03.693
But I met Rick Moranis

01:23:03.717 --> 01:23:06.218
right after Honey,
I Shrunk the Kids

01:23:06.242 --> 01:23:09.699
and, honey, did I
shrink his kids.

01:23:09.723 --> 01:23:12.161
You know?

01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:18.689
I"m sweating.
