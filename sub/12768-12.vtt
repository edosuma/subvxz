00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.792 --> 00:09.792
(whirring)

00:13.083 --> 00:16.792
OH, THE--THE RANGE OF MOVEMENT
IS AMAZING.

00:16.834 --> 00:18.917
YOU THINK THAT'S GOOD.
HEY, PETE.

00:18.959 --> 00:21.792
GO ON. TOSS IT TO COLIN.
COME ON. DON'T BE AFRAID
TO PUT A LITTLE HEAT ON IT.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.041
I'M PRETTY GOOD.

00:24.083 --> 00:26.542
(laughs)
NICE CATCH.

00:26.583 --> 00:29.542
I CONNECTED THE ARM DIRECTLY
TO COLIN'S NERVOUS SYSTEM.

00:29.583 --> 00:32.625
THE BRAIN THINKS "CATCH
THE BALL," AND THE HAND DOES IT.
THE GUYS IN MY UNIT
WOULD FREAK.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.792
OH, WERE--WERE YOU
IN IRAQ?
AFGHANISTAN.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.041
YEAH.

00:36.083 --> 00:38.375
(sighs) FEEL FREE
TO USE WORDS

00:38.417 --> 00:40.834
LIKE "GENIUS"
OR "BRILLIANT" AT WILL.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.125
I DON'T HAVE TO
'CAUSE YOU JUST DID.

00:43.166 --> 00:45.458
IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO MEET YOU,

00:45.500 --> 00:47.750
AND, UH,
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR ARM.

00:47.792 --> 00:50.041
AH. (groans)

00:50.083 --> 00:52.000
(Pete) YOU OKAY?
NO, SOMETHING--

00:52.041 --> 00:55.625
OH, IT BURNS.
HELP HIM, OR HE'S GONNA
PULL OUT THE NEURO CONNECTORS.

00:55.667 --> 00:56.875
MM. AH.

00:56.917 --> 00:59.000
(pants)

00:59.041 --> 01:00.834
AH.

01:00.875 --> 01:03.166
YOU IMPLANTED A BOLT
IN HIS ARM?
OSSEOUS INTEGRATION.

01:03.208 --> 01:06.041
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO CARRY THE WEIGHT.
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
IT'S ALSO ILLEGAL.

01:06.083 --> 01:09.000
IN THIS COUNTRY.
I SENT HIM TO SWEDEN.
AH!

01:09.041 --> 01:11.709
AH! MM.
OKAY, IT'S INFECTED.
HE'S BURNING UP.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.041
WE'VE GOTTA GET HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.709
(wheelchair motor whirs)

01:15.750 --> 01:17.709
(Dell) OKAY, WELL,
MAYA'S IN YOUR OFFICE.

01:17.750 --> 01:20.625
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT ME
IN THE CAR ON THE WAY OVER HERE,

01:20.667 --> 01:23.709
AND NOW YOU GOT SAM AND NAOMI
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.208
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?
NO, I CAN'T, DELL.
I WISH I COULD, BUT I CAN'T.

01:27.250 --> 01:29.208
GUYS, UM,
VERY PREGNANT WOMAN

01:29.250 --> 01:31.750
SQUATTING UP AND DOWN
IN THE HALLWAY?
NOT MINE.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.917
SHE'S MINE. LYNN McDONALD. SHE'S
COMMITTED TO NATURAL CHILDBIRTH.

01:34.959 --> 01:36.917
SHE'S BEEN IN LABOR
FOR TWO DAYS.

01:36.959 --> 01:39.667
HER WATER FINALLY BROKE
LAST NIGHT.
OOH. THIS ISN'T WORKING.

01:39.709 --> 01:41.667
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING SPICY
IN THE FRIDGE?

01:41.709 --> 01:43.750
LIKE MAYBE--MAYBE
A CHIMICHANGA, HUH?

01:43.792 --> 01:46.834
THAT'LL SPEED UP
THE LABOR, RIGHT?
YEAH, I'LL ORDER YOU SOMETHING.

01:46.875 --> 01:48.834
YEAH. OKAY, BABY, COME OUT.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.458
(exhales deeply)
AND COME OUT.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.500
(exhales)
AND... COME OUT.

01:53.542 --> 01:55.834
WELL, LET'S GO CHECK OUT
YOUR PROGRESS.
AND COME OUT.

01:55.875 --> 01:59.959
OKAY, ADDISON. WHAT'S THIS
IMPORTANT CASE THAT, UH...

02:00.000 --> 02:01.667
HEY, MAYA GIRL.
HEY.

02:01.709 --> 02:04.500
WHAT'S UP? WAIT. DID YOU HAVE
A HALF A DAY TODAY?
NO, NO, NO.

02:04.542 --> 02:07.792
WAS I SUPPOSED TO--
NO, NO, NO. I ALWAYS KEEP
THE HALF DAYS IN MY CALENDAR.

02:07.834 --> 02:11.000
I KEEP 'EM
IN MY CALENDAR, TOO.
IT'S NOT A HALF DAY.

02:11.041 --> 02:14.500
MAYA HAS SOMETHING
THAT SHE NEEDS TO TELL YOU.

02:16.125 --> 02:18.500
(clears throat)

02:20.041 --> 02:21.959
I...

02:25.709 --> 02:26.792
UM...

02:26.834 --> 02:29.375
(clears throat)

02:29.417 --> 02:31.917
I...

02:36.083 --> 02:38.542
MAYA'S PREGNANT.

02:43.875 --> 02:45.917
NO, SHE'S NOT.

02:45.959 --> 02:47.792
HOW?

02:47.834 --> 02:50.417
WHEN DID YOU START
HAVING S--

02:50.458 --> 02:52.834
WAIT. NO. NO, OKAY.
THIS IS--THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE.

02:52.875 --> 02:55.500
WE DISCUSSED THIS.
WE DISCUSSED BIRTH CONTROL.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.208
YOUR--TWO DOCTORS.

02:57.250 --> 03:00.041
BOTH YOUR PARENTS ARE DOCTORS.
HOW COULD YOU BE PREGNANT?

03:00.083 --> 03:01.792
HOW COULD THIS BE HAPPENING?

03:01.834 --> 03:04.041
WHAT WERE--
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

03:04.083 --> 03:06.166
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?
OUR DAUGHTER JUST TOLD US

03:06.208 --> 03:08.375
THAT--THAT--THAT
SHE IS PREGNANT.

03:08.417 --> 03:10.375
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
I CAN'T.

03:10.417 --> 03:13.583
MOM--
NAOMI, WE ARE HER PARENTS.

03:13.625 --> 03:16.417
I CAN'T.

03:30.625 --> 03:31.792
(sighs)

03:31.834 --> 03:34.041
NAOMI WALKED AWAY.

03:34.083 --> 03:37.041
OUR DAUGHTER IS PREGNANT,
AND NAOMI WALKED AWAY.
I KNOW.

03:37.083 --> 03:40.041
SHE'S IN SHOCK.
SHE'S DEALING WITH IT.
I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST WAIT

03:40.083 --> 03:42.166
UNTIL SHE DECIDES
THAT SHE'S READY?

03:42.208 --> 03:44.875
WE NEED TO TALK
TO OUR DAUGHTER NOW.

03:44.917 --> 03:46.875
SAM, THIS ISN'T
THE FIRST TIME

03:46.917 --> 03:49.291
I'VE DELIVERED
THIS KIND OF NEWS.

03:49.333 --> 03:53.041
PEOPLE NEED TIME. GIVE...
GIVE NAOMI SOME TIME.

03:53.083 --> 03:55.041
COLIN, YOU HAVE
A SEVERE INFECTION.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.875
HOW LONG
HAS IT BEEN HURTING?

03:56.917 --> 04:00.917
A MONTH. I THOUGHT
IT WAS NORMAL PAIN.

04:00.959 --> 04:03.875
AND I WAS AFRAID
THAT IF IT WAS THE BOLT,

04:03.917 --> 04:07.000
THEN I COULDN'T KEEP THE ARM.
WELL, DR. WILDER FEELS
THE BOLT SHOULD COME OUT.

04:07.041 --> 04:10.667
NO. CAN'T WE DO
MORE ANTIBIOTICS OR SOMETHING?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY,
DR. WILDER?

04:10.709 --> 04:12.667
YOU SPECIALIZE
IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

04:12.709 --> 04:15.458
YOU KNOW ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS.
WHAT ARE HIS OPTIONS?

04:15.500 --> 04:18.041
THERE HAS TO BE
SOMETHING UP YOUR SLEEVE

04:18.083 --> 04:21.250
SINCE YOU HAVE TWO OF THEM.
THERE ARE
EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOLS,

04:21.291 --> 04:24.041
BUT THE F.D.A. HASN'T COMPLETED
SAFETY STUDIES,

04:24.083 --> 04:26.041
AND THERE ARE REPORTS
OF SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS.

04:26.083 --> 04:29.041
I'M SORRY. THE BOLT IS
THE SOURCE OF THE INFECTION,

04:29.083 --> 04:31.125
AND THE SAFEST THING TO DO
IS REMOVE IT

04:31.166 --> 04:33.625
BEFORE THE INFECTION SPREADS.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.208
BEFORE I DEPLOYED,
I GOT ENGAGED.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.208
WE WROTE LETTERS,
WE PLANNED THE WHOLE THING,

04:38.250 --> 04:40.750
RIGHT DOWN TO THE DANCE
THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO,

04:40.792 --> 04:43.041
WHICH REQUIRES ME
TO DIP HER TO THE FLOOR.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.959
NOW I'M LIVING UP
TO MY PART OF THIS.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
I'M GOING TO HOLD HER
IN MY ARMS--BOTH ARMS--

04:48.041 --> 04:50.959
AND I'M GOING TO DANCE WITH HER
THE WAY I PROMISED.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.458
YOU CAME BACK ALIVE.
YOU'RE HEALTHY AND ALIVE.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.458
I KNOW YOU PLANNED FOR MORE,
BUT I CANNOT TREAT YOU

04:56.500 --> 04:59.291
IN A WAY THAT WILL
JEOPARDIZE YOUR HEALTH.
DR. WILDER--

04:59.333 --> 05:02.000
COLIN, THIS INFECTION
COULD KILL YOU.

05:02.041 --> 05:05.041
I KNOW THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOUR FIANCéE WANTS.

05:05.083 --> 05:08.083
(Violet) WHY DO THEY DO THIS?

05:08.125 --> 05:10.709
WHY DOES THE HOSPITAL
KEEP SENDING ME SAMPLES?

05:10.750 --> 05:14.583
IT'S LIKE "GASLIGHT,"
BUT WITH BABY STUFF.

05:14.625 --> 05:17.875
"GASLIGHT"? FAMOUS MOVIE?

05:17.917 --> 05:21.041
NEVER SAW IT.
INGRID BERGMAN.

05:21.083 --> 05:24.041
HER HUSBAND
TRIES TO DRIVE HER CRAZY.
UH, WHEN THE PETERMANS
GET HERE,

05:24.083 --> 05:26.208
WILL YOU PUT THEM
IN EXAM ROOM THREE?
I'M USING EXAM ROOM THREE.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.959
OH, ACTUALLY ROOM THREE
IS FOR PEDIATRICS.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.875
AND I HAVE A 7 YEAR OLD WITH
A URINARY TRACT INFECTION.

05:34.083 --> 05:39.041
IT'S--IT'S ABOUT A MARRIAGE
THAT ENDS BADLY.

05:39.083 --> 05:40.166
"GASLIGHT."

05:51.000 --> 05:52.166
MARSHA.

05:52.208 --> 05:54.000
HI. VIOLET TURNER.

05:54.041 --> 05:55.208
UH, HERE'S THE SITUATION--

05:55.250 --> 05:57.458
I DON'T WANT
ANY MORE BABY STUFF.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.333
SO NO DIAPER CREAM SAMPLES.

06:00.375 --> 06:02.041
I'VE--I'VE CALLED,
I'VE E-MAILED,

06:02.083 --> 06:05.000
I'VE MAIL-MAILED
FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS,

06:05.041 --> 06:07.625
BUT THE HOSPITAL
JUST KEEPS SENDING IT.
MOST NEW MOTHERS APPRECIATE
OUR LITTLE FREEBIES.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.625
WELL, I AM NOT A NEW MOTHER.
HOW OLD IS YOUR BABY?

06:10.667 --> 06:12.834
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

06:12.875 --> 06:15.875
I AM NOT A NEW OR AN OLD
OR ANY KIND OF MOTHER.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.125
I DON'T HAVE A BABY ANYMORE.

06:18.166 --> 06:20.041
OH. OH, MY GOD.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.041
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.041
THEY'RE GOD'S
LITTLEST ANGELS,

06:24.083 --> 06:26.250
THE ONES WE LOSE.

06:26.291 --> 06:29.041
COULD YOU JUST GET
THE FORM?

06:29.083 --> 06:31.041
OF COURSE.

06:31.083 --> 06:34.417
I'M SORRY, TOO,
FOR YOUR LOSS.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.417
OH, NO, NO. IT'S JUST--
I-I WAS JUST--

06:36.458 --> 06:38.834
NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN. I-I GET IT.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.667
I-I--
I LOST MY WIFE TODAY.

06:41.709 --> 06:43.041
OH, MY GOD.

06:43.083 --> 06:46.041
A SENTENCE YOU NEVER THINK
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SAY,

06:46.083 --> 06:49.041
YOU KNOW, "I LOST--
I LOST MY WIFE."

06:49.083 --> 06:51.041
AND, UH, EVERY TIME
YOU SAY IT,

06:51.083 --> 06:53.166
YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO BREATHE,

06:53.208 --> 06:55.917
AND IT'S LIKE--IT'S LIKE
SOMEBODY SHOT YOU OR SOMETHING.

06:55.959 --> 06:57.917
AND THEN I--AND THEN I HEAR

06:57.959 --> 07:00.041
THAT YOU LOST YOUR CHILD--
YOUR BABY--AND IT'S--

07:00.083 --> 07:02.125
IT, LIKE, GIVES IT
PERSPECTIVE, YOU KNOW?

07:02.166 --> 07:05.125
IT--IT'S--IT'S--IT HELPS ME
TO KNOW YOU LOST YOUR CHILD.

07:05.166 --> 07:08.125
AND I KNOW THAT'S
A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY TO YOU.

07:08.166 --> 07:11.041
UM... MY WIFE'S DEAD,
AND I'VE OFFENDED YOU,

07:11.083 --> 07:13.041
AND I'M SORRY...

07:13.083 --> 07:14.667
FOR YOUR LOSS.

07:14.709 --> 07:17.041
NO, NO. I'M--I'M SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

07:17.083 --> 07:20.291
THEY GAVE ME THIS BAG
WITH HER... BELONGINGS.

07:20.333 --> 07:22.041
IT'S...

07:22.083 --> 07:24.041
(exhales) IT'S FUNNY.

07:24.083 --> 07:27.041
I THOUGHT THERE'D BE MORE
TO TAKE HOME.

07:27.083 --> 07:30.041
DO YOU NEED...

07:30.083 --> 07:33.125
CAN I HELP YOU?
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

07:33.166 --> 07:35.166
UH, NO. NO, NO.
I-I'M JUST WAITING.

07:35.208 --> 07:37.458
A FRIEND'S PICKING ME UP,
SO...

07:37.500 --> 07:39.041
OKAY.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.500
WELL...

07:41.542 --> 07:43.500
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:43.542 --> 07:45.458
I'M NATHAN PILSMAN.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.041
VIOLET TURNER.

07:47.083 --> 07:49.041
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,
VIOLET TURNER.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.375
WELL, NOT NICE,
BUT... IT'S NICE.

07:56.083 --> 07:58.041
(whirring)

07:58.083 --> 08:01.083
(footsteps approach)

08:01.125 --> 08:03.083
YOU CAN'T WALK.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.250
YOU'RE BLACK.
WHAT GAME ARE WE PLAYING?

08:05.291 --> 08:08.750
THE DAY
THAT YOU FOUND OUT...

08:08.792 --> 08:11.583
WHEN THEY TOLD YOU THAT,
UH, YOUR LEGS--

08:11.625 --> 08:13.959
THAT YOU WOULD--YOU WOULD
NEVER WALK AGAIN,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.625
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE.

08:16.667 --> 08:19.500
HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH IT?

08:19.542 --> 08:22.834
WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME THAT
THAT WAS MY WORST DAY?

08:22.875 --> 08:25.625
LOSING MY LEGS
CHANGED MY LIFE,

08:25.667 --> 08:28.083
BUT, UH, IT CERTAINLY
DIDN'T RUIN IT.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.333
THERE'S A PERIOD
OF ADJUSTMENT,

08:30.375 --> 08:34.041
BUT... YOU DEAL WITH IT.

08:34.083 --> 08:36.834
YOU'RE FULL OF CRAP.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.041
(elevator bell dings)

08:43.083 --> 08:46.041
(indistinct conversations)

08:51.792 --> 08:54.792
NAOMI, WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

08:57.083 --> 08:59.041
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:59.083 --> 09:00.750
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:00.792 --> 09:02.917
NAOMI,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

09:04.208 --> 09:06.667
I NEED YOU TO GIVE MAYA
AN ABORTION.
WHAT?

09:06.709 --> 09:10.000
NAI.
MOM, NO.
I DON'T WANT AN ABORTION.

09:10.041 --> 09:12.834
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WANT.
BUT, MOM--

09:12.875 --> 09:14.667
GIVE HER AN ABORTION.

09:18.083 --> 09:20.041
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I SLAPPED HER.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.667
I HIT MY CHILD.

09:21.709 --> 09:23.208
YOU WERE UPSET, CLEARLY.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.250
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING
TO DEAL WITH.

09:25.291 --> 09:29.041
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT I...
WELL, I CAN'T--I LOST IT.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.792
BUT C-CAN YOU BELIEVE HER?

09:31.834 --> 09:36.291
CAN YOU BELIEVE HER
SAYING NO TO ME?

09:36.333 --> 09:38.000
WHAT?

09:38.041 --> 09:40.000
YOU ORDERED HER
TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

09:40.041 --> 09:43.000
SO PUTTING ASIDE THE FACT THAT
YOU ARE PERSONALLY AGAINST IT--

09:43.041 --> 09:46.041
YOU CAN'T MAKE SOMEONE
HAVE AN ABORTION, NAI.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.709
NO, NO, NO. THIS IS--THIS--THIS
IS NOT UP FOR DISCUSSION.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.709
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU'RE
NOT GONNA DO IT, THAT'S FINE.

09:52.750 --> 09:56.291
I WILL FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR
WHO WILL.
OKAY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO I'M TALKING TO RIGHT NOW.

09:56.333 --> 09:59.041
THIS IS NOT YOU.
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF YOU.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.667
YOU--YOU GIVE PEOPLE BABIES,

10:00.709 --> 10:03.959
AND WHETHER OR NOT I AGREE
WITH YOUR STAND ON THIS ISSUE,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.917
THIS ISN'T YOU.
DON'T DO SOMETHING NOW THAT YOU
WILL HATE YOURSELF FOR LATER.

10:07.959 --> 10:11.083
DO YOU HATE YOURSELF
FOR YOUR ABORTIONS?

10:11.125 --> 10:12.917
EITHER OF YOU?

10:12.959 --> 10:16.083
NO, I DON'T HATE MYSELF.
BUT I DO THINK ABOUT IT.

10:16.125 --> 10:19.083
IT STAYS WITH YOU EVEN IF YOU
DO IT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS,

10:19.125 --> 10:22.250
AND IT IS NOT A CASUAL DECISION
THAT YOU CAN MAKE FOR MAYA.

10:22.291 --> 10:26.041
THIS--THIS IS MY FAMILY.
YOU DO NOT JUDGE MY FAMILY!

10:26.083 --> 10:28.750
WE'RE NOT JUDGING.
YOU KNOW THAT.
LOOK, THIS HAS HIT YOU HARD,

10:28.792 --> 10:31.291
AND THAT CAN MAKE YOU CHANGE
WHAT YOU BELIEVE--
STOP IT. STOP IT.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.291
(voice breaking) STOP ACTING
LIKE YOU UNDERSTAND,

10:33.333 --> 10:34.750
BECAUSE YOU DON'T.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.750
YOU DON'T.
THIS IS MY CHILD.

10:36.792 --> 10:39.792
THIS IS MY CHILD WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT, MY CHILD...

10:39.834 --> 10:42.875
WHO I'VE DONE EVERYTHING IN
MY POWER TO RAISE AND PROTECT.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.875
AND NOW SHE'S GONE
AND DONE SOMETHING STUPID--

10:44.917 --> 10:46.875
STUPID--
THAT'S GONNA RUIN HER LIFE,

10:46.917 --> 10:48.875
AND I'M NOT
GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

10:48.917 --> 10:51.709
I AM HER MOTHER.
I AM HER MOTHER.
NAOMI--

10:51.750 --> 10:54.000
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT. YOU HAVE
NO MORAL HIGH GROUND.

10:54.041 --> 10:56.834
YOU WALKED AWAY
FROM YOUR CHILD.

10:56.875 --> 11:00.000
IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH THAT,
I CAN LIVE WITH THIS.

11:01.625 --> 11:04.041
SHE'S JUST UPSET. YOU--

11:04.083 --> 11:05.709
I KNOW.

11:05.750 --> 11:09.041
(knocks on doorjamb)
(clears throat) UH,
I KNOW THIS IS A BAD TIME,

11:09.083 --> 11:12.041
BUT MY PATIENT--I-I COULD
REALLY USE YOUR HELP.

11:12.083 --> 11:15.041
YES. PLEASE.
TELL ME SHE NEEDS SURGERY.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.208
THAT I CAN DO.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.834
OH, DON'T NEED YOUR HELP
OPENING A DOOR.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.375
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD
AT TAKING HELP, ARE YOU?

11:27.417 --> 11:29.875
OH, ACTUALLY, I AM. YOUR IDEA
ABOUT EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOLS?

11:29.917 --> 11:31.458
I CONTACTED MY FRIEND

11:31.500 --> 11:34.041
AT THE F.D.A.,
GOT THE INFO, WENT WITH IT.

11:34.083 --> 11:37.041
YOU'RE NOT TAKING OUT
COLIN'S BOLT?
YOU MIGHT BE AFRAID TO TAKE
A RISK, BUT I'M NOT.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.000
I ASSUMED
NAOMI BROUGHT YOU IN

11:39.041 --> 11:40.625
BECAUSE YOU WERE
JUST AS CUTTING-EDGE

11:40.667 --> 11:42.333
AS EVERYONE ELSE AROUND HERE.

11:42.375 --> 11:45.041
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE
THE SAFE ALTERNATIVE.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.041
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU--HEY. HEY. HEY.

11:47.083 --> 11:50.041
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT AND ROLL AWAY.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.750
CAN'T HEAR YOU
OVER THE NOISE OF MY CHAIR.
(elevator bell dings)

11:52.792 --> 11:54.875
HEY, PETE.

11:54.917 --> 11:56.417
MAYA IS PREGNANT.

11:56.458 --> 11:59.000
SAM NEEDS TO DRINK.
YOU IN?

12:02.542 --> 12:04.083
(Lynn) OH!

12:04.125 --> 12:06.083
UH, LYNN'S IN A LOT OF PAIN.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.083
SHE SHOWS NO SIGN
OF FETAL DISTRESS,

12:08.125 --> 12:11.250
BUT HER LABOR
ISN'T PROGRESSING.
I THOUGHT
AFTER MY WATER BROKE...

12:11.291 --> 12:14.250
WELL, I CAN GIVE YOU OXYTOCIN
TO SPEED UP THE LABOR

12:14.291 --> 12:17.041
AND SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN.
MY BIRTH PLAN SAYS NO DRUGS.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.375
LYNN HAS A BIRTH PLAN.

12:18.417 --> 12:20.250
OH, MANY PAGES...

12:20.291 --> 12:22.875
AND SMALL FONT.
YEAH.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.667
I WANT TO EXPERIENCE
MY CHILD'S BIRTH.
UH, LYNN--

12:25.709 --> 12:27.208
I DID MY HOMEWORK, OKAY?

12:27.250 --> 12:29.875
I-I UNDERSTAND
THAT THERE ARE PROCEDURES

12:29.917 --> 12:31.917
THAT, YOU KNOW,
MAY BECOME NECESSARY,

12:31.959 --> 12:34.083
BUT EXCEPT IN A CASE
OF EXTREME EMERGENCY,

12:34.125 --> 12:37.500
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO BE GIVEN
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCEPT OR--

12:37.542 --> 12:38.959
OR REFUSE ANY PROCEDURE.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.959
AND AS LONG AS THE BABY'S OKAY,
ALL RIGHT,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.458
I WANT TO HAVE
A NATURAL CHILDBIRTH.

12:43.500 --> 12:47.709
SO TO GET THE LABOR GOING,
I'M WILLING TO TRY WALKING

12:47.750 --> 12:51.041
OR CASTOR OIL
OR NIPPLE STIMULATION--

12:51.083 --> 12:52.959
WELL, IT'S
A LITTLE MORE INVOLVED.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.417
IF YOU FAIL TO PROGRESS
IN YOUR LABOR,

12:55.458 --> 12:58.417
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER
A C-SECTION.
NO. NO.

12:58.458 --> 13:01.417
LYNN, LOOK, I KNOW
THIS CAN BE DISAPPOINTING--
I'VE BEEN IN SCREAMING PAIN
FOR HOURS.

13:01.458 --> 13:04.542
I'M NOT--I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT BEING DISAPPOINTED.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.959
(grunts)

13:07.000 --> 13:09.583
YOU KNOW, I-I MARRIED
A GREAT GUY.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.875
YOU KNOW,
I WANTED TO HAVE KIDS.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.375
HE WASN'T READY... EVER.

13:14.417 --> 13:18.041
AND... WHEN THE DIVORCE
WAS FINAL,

13:18.083 --> 13:21.041
I DECIDED TO LET LOOSE.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.458
YOU KNOW,
HAVING A BABY ALONE,

13:23.500 --> 13:26.458
BEING PREGNANT BY SOME GUY
THAT I MET AT THE TEQUILA BAR,

13:26.500 --> 13:28.458
IS NOT EVERY GIRL'S DREAM,

13:28.500 --> 13:30.542
BUT THIS IS
WHAT'S HAPPENING, OKAY?

13:30.583 --> 13:32.500
AND I AM HAVING THIS BABY.

13:32.542 --> 13:34.500
SO IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK

13:34.542 --> 13:37.083
THAT ONE THING
GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN?

13:37.125 --> 13:39.959
(Harper Simon's "Berkeley Girl"

13:40.000 --> 13:43.041
(Sam) NAOMI HAS LOST HER MIND.

13:43.083 --> 13:47.041
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO SHE WAS TODAY.
DO YOU WANT MAYA
TO HAVE AN ABORTION?

13:47.083 --> 13:48.500
WELL, THAT'S THE POINT.

13:48.542 --> 13:51.500
I'M A GUY. IT'S--
IT'S--IT'S NOT MY CHOICE.

13:51.542 --> 13:53.500
WELL, RIGHT, BUT DO YOU
WANT HER TO--

13:53.542 --> 13:57.041
DO I--I WANT HER TO NOT
BE PREGNANT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.125
I WANT HER
TO NEVER HAVE HAD SEX.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.208
I WANT HER TO LIVE IN A WORLD

14:01.250 --> 14:04.041
WHERE THERE ARE CHASTITY BELTS
AND CONVENTS

14:04.083 --> 14:08.375
AND LITTLE BOYS
BY THE NAME OF DINK DON'T EXIST.

14:08.417 --> 14:10.834
THAT--THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.041
SO DON'T ASK ME
IF I WANT...

14:13.083 --> 14:16.083
MY BABY GIRL
TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

14:16.125 --> 14:18.792

SOMEPLACE TO BE.

19:13.625 --> 19:17.500

I DON'T.

19:17.542 --> 19:19.959
OKAY.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
OKAY.

19:25.959 --> 19:28.041
SORRY.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.542

19:30.583 --> 19:33.041

19:33.083 --> 19:34.417
YEAH, WELL, OKAY.

19:36.083 --> 19:39.542

19:39.583 --> 19:42.000

YOU BOUGHT IT FOR ME.

19:43.458 --> 19:45.959
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA HAVE
SOME OTHER WOMAN WEAR IT?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.417

GIVE IT TO YOU

19:48.458 --> 19:50.750

FOR SOME OTHER GUY?

19:53.083 --> 19:54.834
ACTUALLY, WE DIDN'T.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.000
WE DISLIKED EACH OTHER,
AND THEN WE HAD SEX,

19:57.041 --> 19:59.000
AND THEN WE FELL IN LOVE.

19:59.041 --> 20:02.041
WE NEVER LIKED EACH OTHER.

20:02.083 --> 20:05.000
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:05.041 --> 20:08.333
I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE
THE PRACTICE.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.333
WHAT?
I'LL TAKE OUT A LOAN.
I'LL SELL MY CAR.

20:11.375 --> 20:14.750
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO BUY YOU OUT.
NO.

20:14.792 --> 20:16.750
NO?
NO. I'M BUILDING A BUSINESS.

20:16.792 --> 20:19.041
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU WERE THERE FIRST.

20:19.083 --> 20:22.375
I BELONG THERE JUST AS MUCH AS
YOU DO. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

20:22.417 --> 20:25.041
(hangers clatter)
USELESS, STUPID LOVE.

USELESS, STUPID LOVE!

20:28.083 --> 20:30.000
WASTED TIME.

20:30.041 --> 20:33.041

FIND ANOTHER WOMAN.

20:33.083 --> 20:36.041
HAVE A BLAST WITH IT!
OH, I C--
I WILL! I CAN'T WAIT.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.792
THAT'S MY TOWEL YOU'RE WEARING.
I WANT IT BACK.

20:44.291 --> 20:47.041
YEAH. I FEEL GREAT.

20:47.083 --> 20:50.041
UH, WE--WE COULD CHANGE
THE MUSIC.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.709
WE HAVEN'T LISTENED TO
"CHIRPING BIRDS" YET.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.709
I JUST WANTED THIS
TO BE BEAUTIFUL, YOU KNOW?

20:54.750 --> 20:56.083
ALL MY BOOKS SAID

20:56.125 --> 20:59.041
THAT THE WAY A CHILD
COMES INTO THE WORLD

20:59.083 --> 21:00.500
SHAPES THEM FOR LIFE.

21:00.542 --> 21:03.500
I JUST WANT TO GIVE HIM
THE BEST CHANCE

21:03.542 --> 21:05.500
THAT HE CAN HAVE, YOU KNOW?
MM-HMM.

21:05.542 --> 21:07.500
I-I DON'T WANT TO SHAPE HIM

21:07.542 --> 21:11.709
TO BE SOME ANGRY
OR--OR SCARED... (groans)

21:11.750 --> 21:13.083
DAMN IT.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.917
OH.

21:14.959 --> 21:18.125
I WANT HIM TO HAVE
A GOOD LIFE.

21:18.166 --> 21:20.959
OKAY, LOOK... NO MATTER
HOW TODAY WORKS OUT,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.709
EVEN IF YOU DECIDE
YOU CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN,

21:23.750 --> 21:26.041
YOU'RE STILL GONNA HAVE
PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES

21:26.083 --> 21:27.959
TO SHAPE YOUR CHILD'S LIFE.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
SO CAN I GIVE YOU SOMETHING
TO HELP WITH THE PAIN?

21:31.041 --> 21:34.041
NO. JUST GIVE ME
THE CHIRPING BIRDS.
OKAY.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.250
YEAH.

21:36.291 --> 21:38.041
(birds chirp)

21:38.083 --> 21:41.041
HOW MANY HAVE YOU DONE?

21:41.083 --> 21:45.041
MORE THAN I CAN COUNT.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.792
AND THEY'VE ALL...

21:46.834 --> 21:48.041
THEY'VE TURNED OUT...

21:48.083 --> 21:50.041
WELL, "FINE"
ISN'T THE WORD I'D USE,

21:50.083 --> 21:52.458
BUT WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS.

21:52.500 --> 21:56.291
MY DAUGHTER'S HAVING
AN ABORTION TOMORROW.

21:56.333 --> 22:01.000
THAT IN AND OF ITSELF
IS A COMPLICATION.

22:01.041 --> 22:04.625
SAM, IS IT WEIRD
THAT IT'S ME... DOING IT?

22:04.667 --> 22:06.625
NO.
WOULD YOU PREFER
THAT I GET A--

22:06.667 --> 22:10.041
I'D UNDERSTAND IF--
NO, YOU DO IT.

22:10.083 --> 22:13.041
YOU DO IT THE BEST YOU HAVE
EVER DONE ANYTHING.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.709
DO IT LIKE YOUR LIFE
DEPENDS ON IT.

22:15.750 --> 22:18.166
(voice breaks) IT'S MAYA.

22:21.208 --> 22:25.041
OH. OH. UGH.

22:25.083 --> 22:26.417
COLIN, WHAT HAPPENED?

22:26.458 --> 22:29.041
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
I-I TOLD 'EM TO CALL YOU. I--

22:29.083 --> 22:31.041
I KNOW YOU WANTED TO TAKE
THE BOLT OUT.

22:31.083 --> 22:34.125
YOU TOLD ME THE ANTIBIOTICS
WERE TOO RISKY, BUT I W--
THIS ISN'T EVEN
THE RIGHT DOSAGE.

22:34.166 --> 22:36.625
DR. FIFE LOWERED IT. HE--
IT WAS--

22:36.667 --> 22:39.000
HE SAID
IT WAS DAMAGING MY NERVES

22:39.041 --> 22:42.333
AND HE SAID THAT HIS ARM
WOULDN'T WORK AND--OHH.

22:42.375 --> 22:45.041
(vomits)
DAMN IT.
THE INFECTION IS SPREADING.

22:45.083 --> 22:47.750
GET ME A CENTRAL LINE KIT.
(groans)

22:53.083 --> 22:55.959
YOU HAVE GOT TO GET
THAT BOLT OUT.
I'LL TAKE IT UNDER ADVISEMENT.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.959
YOU--IT--
THIS IS HIS LIFE,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.458
AND YOU ARE SO CONCERNED
WITH YOUR INVENTION.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.834
IT'S WHAT COLIN WANTED.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.375
IT'S WHAT YOU SOLD HIM.

23:03.417 --> 23:05.375
NAOMI WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

23:05.417 --> 23:06.834
YOU'RE FULL OF CRAP.

23:06.875 --> 23:10.041
YOU DON'T WANT TO FIX HIS ARM.
YOU WANT TO FIX YOUR LEGS.

23:10.083 --> 23:12.041
NO. I ALREADY TRIED,
AND I CAN'T.

23:12.083 --> 23:15.083
OKAY, IS THAT SUPPOSED TO
MAKE ME FEEL SORRY FOR YOU?

23:15.125 --> 23:18.083
I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR ME.
I'VE ACCEPTED WHAT I LOST

23:18.125 --> 23:21.166
AND I'LL ACCEPT IT FOR COLIN
AS WELL, BUT NOT YET.
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.

23:21.208 --> 23:24.000
MAYBE, AND MAYBE THERE IS
SOMETHING OUT THERE

23:24.041 --> 23:26.000

THOUGHT OF YET.

23:26.041 --> 23:29.041
LOOK, I'M NOT GOOD AT ASKING
FOR HELP, BUT I'M ASKING.

23:29.083 --> 23:32.000
MY PATIENT WANTS TO PICK UP
HIS LIFE WERE IT LEFT OFF.

23:32.041 --> 23:34.000
IT MAY NOT BE
WHAT YOU WOULD CHOOSE,

23:34.041 --> 23:36.041
BUT IT'S WHAT HE CHOOSES.

23:36.083 --> 23:37.834

SOMETHING?
DID YOU MOVE
ALL YOUR STUFF IN HERE?

24:02.583 --> 24:04.917
I SOLD MY PLACE.

24:04.959 --> 24:08.041

IT WAS A ROOKIE MISTAKE.

24:08.083 --> 24:11.125
GIVING IT ALL UP FOR A GUY,
MOVING INTO COOPER'S APARTMENT,

24:11.166 --> 24:13.125
MOVING INTO THE PRACTICE
WHERE HE WORKED.

24:13.166 --> 24:16.125
(chuckles) I CHANGED MY LIFE
TO BE WITH HIM.

24:16.166 --> 24:18.500
I WENT ALL-IN ON FOREVER.

24:18.542 --> 24:21.000
DOES COOPER KNOW THAT?
NO POINT NOW.

24:21.041 --> 24:22.542
HE WANTS ME OUT.

24:22.583 --> 24:25.792
HE WANTS TO PRETEND WE DIDN'T
HAPPEN, THAT I DON'T EXIST.

24:25.834 --> 24:30.959
WELL, HE THINKS THAT'S GONNA
MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.500
BUT IT WON'T.

24:32.542 --> 24:34.959

A-ALONE.
