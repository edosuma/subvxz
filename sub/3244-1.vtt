00:46.422 --> 00:48.257
Anyone in here?

02:14.885 --> 02:18.681
<i>Same dream every night.
For a year now.</i>

02:21.267 --> 02:24.311
<i>I thought a little party
would make it disappear.</i>

02:24.520 --> 02:28.274
<i>But as one wakes up,
new nightmares take over.</i>

02:38.534 --> 02:40.953
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

02:46.959 --> 02:53.466
SOLAR FILMS
PRESENTS

03:28.042 --> 03:31.420
VARES - THE SHERIFF

03:32.171 --> 03:34.715
<i>And then some domestic crime news.</i>

03:34.882 --> 03:40.930
<i>The 'Swing Bride murders' Police
Task Force has been terminated.</i>

03:41.347 --> 03:45.935
<i>The investigations
of the shocking double murder -</i>

03:46.102 --> 03:49.271
<i>have shown no results.</i>

03:52.108 --> 03:54.402
<i>The police
are reducing resources...</i>

03:54.568 --> 03:58.989
You OK?
- Can you turn the TV off?

04:01.033 --> 04:02.702
Thanks.

04:02.952 --> 04:06.664
<i>Three weeks of
deadly, brain-melting heat.</i>

04:06.872 --> 04:09.375
<i>And haunting nightmares.</i>

04:09.542 --> 04:12.003
<i>And a surprising job offer.</i>

04:13.587 --> 04:16.132
What are you staring at?

04:24.515 --> 04:27.518
Your reputation is not flawless.
- What?

04:28.060 --> 04:30.479
But it's good enough.
- What?

04:30.646 --> 04:36.152
Where were you a year ago?
September 17th, Tuesday evening.

04:36.277 --> 04:39.905
Not one of my better days.
What do you want?

04:40.573 --> 04:44.076
Are you man enough
to go back to the past?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.913
Are we on candid camera?

04:48.080 --> 04:52.626
My employer wants you to find out
who murdered Anneli Valkama.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.095
<i>Mt! Mozart playing
on the car stereo, -</i>

05:03.262 --> 05:06.891
<i>the servant with a stick up his ass
drove me to a luxury bunker.</i>

05:32.500 --> 05:37.421
A glass of Chablis?
- Why not, it's past 10 AM.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.803
White wine is good
for my sun allergy.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.681
I've had it for a year now.
Since Anneli died.

05:48.891 --> 05:52.228
The windows
won't allow the sunrays in.

05:52.395 --> 05:57.441
Was Anneli your daughter?
- A goddaughter. Like my own.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.111
Thank you, Victor.

06:12.957 --> 06:15.376
Will you accept this assignment?

06:17.086 --> 06:19.338
The police
have been investigating...

06:19.505 --> 06:22.216
With zero results!
- Right.

06:24.677 --> 06:30.141
It's not an easy evening to forget.
- That's why you're the right man.

06:31.475 --> 06:34.270
A thousand a week,
regardless of the results.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.690
And a bonus of fifty thousand
if you find the murderer.

06:38.691 --> 06:43.404
<i>First stop: Lieutenant Hautavainio.
Smoking electronic cigarettes -</i>

06:43.571 --> 06:46.240
<i>but still
as ill-tempered as always.</i>

06:46.365 --> 06:50.286
No way in hell.
- How about the CSI tapes?

06:50.661 --> 06:54.665
The investigation is over. Come on!
- Don't be naive.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.792
It was on TV.

06:56.959 --> 07:00.338
You know well that a murder
investigation is never over.

07:01.297 --> 07:04.383
This is my last chance
to get back to ground zero.

07:04.759 --> 07:10.306
What the hell do you mean?
- I'm traumatized.

07:11.182 --> 07:14.977
I have to get back to the start.
Work on it.

07:15.144 --> 07:20.274
The best policemen have been
on the case for a year. The best.

07:21.817 --> 07:26.364
I'm not stepping on anyone's toes.
- I'm not looking down on you.

07:27.323 --> 07:30.576
What on earth do you think
you're going to find out?

07:30.743 --> 07:32.620
The murderer.

07:33.788 --> 07:35.998
Who's your employer?

07:36.207 --> 07:39.210
Don't be naive.
- You can't tell?

07:39.418 --> 07:41.379
Ten points.

07:41.629 --> 07:45.925
Is it the local Black Widow?

07:48.344 --> 07:49.929
I knew that.
- How?

07:50.471 --> 07:55.184
You blinked.
- I'm just an innocent bystander.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.520
I don't need this third degree.

07:58.104 --> 08:03.192
Did she really get you into this?
The reason you're still half-mad.

08:03.401 --> 08:06.862
Is that a healthy thing?
- What do you want me to say?

08:08.614 --> 08:10.574
Is she paying that well?

08:14.912 --> 08:19.834
I just hope you won't
have to regret your decision.

08:20.668 --> 08:25.214
The local underworld seems to be
interested too. If I only knew why.

08:25.423 --> 08:27.425
What format are they?

08:28.342 --> 08:31.220
What?
- The CSI tapes.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.739
<i>Anneli Valkama, 38.</i>

08:50.031 --> 08:57.621
<i>Ex-girlfriend of the male victim
Johannes Salomaa, 44, an ex-cop.</i>

08:58.622 --> 09:01.250
<i>Half-familiar from the old days.</i>

09:01.834 --> 09:07.089
<i>We had agreed to meet that night.</i>

09:09.050 --> 09:12.386
<i>I never found out
the reason on the phone.</i>

09:14.388 --> 09:19.602
<i>What was it he wanted to tell me?
And why was she there?</i>

09:19.769 --> 09:22.938
CUTS ON THE VICTIM'S BODY:
RANDOM OR MEANINGFUL?

10:03.854 --> 10:05.564
<i>I had to find out-</i>

10:05.731 --> 10:09.151
<i>why the underworld
was interested in the case.</i>

10:10.027 --> 10:14.615
I see the flag is up!
- Nothing to sell today.

10:14.824 --> 10:18.035
Antidote! It's me, Jussi!

10:20.371 --> 10:23.708
What's up?
- The Swing Bride murders.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.711
I don't know anything.
- About anything.

10:37.930 --> 10:42.977
The word is that your associates
are interested in the case.

10:43.728 --> 10:48.524
Why are they interested
in this double homicide?

10:48.691 --> 10:53.029
I'm just an errand boy.
One of the smallest.

10:55.239 --> 10:57.241
Can you put a word out?

10:57.533 --> 11:00.327
That a local gumshoe
is on the case. Officially.

11:00.578 --> 11:03.622
Why would I do that?
- Because of our deal.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.917
Of mutual friendship,
cooperation, assistance.

11:13.883 --> 11:15.801
I'll talk to Sylvi.

11:17.928 --> 11:21.223
Dear members of the press,
and technical expert). Vares.

11:21.390 --> 11:24.393
You have one hour. You can look,
but you can't touch.

11:24.602 --> 11:29.357
One hour is not enough!
We have two pages to cover.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.777
Take it or leave it.
You just wasted half a minute.

11:32.943 --> 11:36.655
If this was my call, you wouldn't
be anywhere near this place.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.325
The old boy network
must be behind this.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.410
A deal made at the poker table.

11:43.037 --> 11:45.414
The house goes
on the market tomorrow.

11:45.623 --> 11:47.708
I wonder if the new owner
will talk?

11:47.917 --> 11:53.130
The dream home
finally found a buyer.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.549
I guess it wasn't expensive.

11:55.758 --> 11:59.136
The dude started losing it
after the gig in Afghanistan.

11:59.303 --> 12:03.933
That's good. 'The veteran who fell
from the grace." Headline material.

12:04.100 --> 12:07.019
<i>Back at ground zero.</i>

12:07.478 --> 12:13.317
<i>Ruuhio was now working for
yellow press. Right up his alley.</i>

12:13.651 --> 12:16.153
What will sell? What will sell?

12:16.320 --> 12:19.657
Naked women.
- The cum on the wall Sperm!

12:19.824 --> 12:25.371
One from there. This mattress
has seen some action. This is life!

12:26.205 --> 12:28.207
He took the war hard.

12:28.499 --> 12:32.044
And society turned its back
on the man and his traumas.

12:32.253 --> 12:36.048
Wouldn't be surprised if he had
the gun in his mouth once or twice.

12:36.215 --> 12:39.301
Maybe the real reason
is in his military past?

12:40.469 --> 12:42.596
No evidence.

12:42.972 --> 12:47.101
A murder always has a motive.
Especially a murder like this.

12:47.268 --> 12:50.980
Must be in his police background.

12:51.981 --> 12:54.358
I take it
nothing has been taken out?

12:56.027 --> 12:58.029
No.

13:03.200 --> 13:09.540
Nothing at all. Not even
the thousand in her wallet.

13:13.878 --> 13:16.797
That wall is cool! Take a picture!

13:18.007 --> 13:19.759
Step aside, please.

13:28.351 --> 13:32.146
That film has been on TV. The name
was translated as The Sheriff.

13:32.313 --> 13:34.148
I guess you're right.

13:34.315 --> 13:37.068
This is like the man's soul
Take a wide shot.

13:38.903 --> 13:42.948
Come on. And one of him.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.868
The investigator returns
to the crime scene.

13:46.035 --> 13:48.662
Put the camera away.
Just shoot the premises.

13:48.913 --> 13:50.664
Easy does it.

13:54.210 --> 13:57.838
Jussi, let's get out of here.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.135
How about the cutting marks?

14:03.386 --> 14:07.056
We had a legion of specialists
investigating. For months.

14:07.223 --> 14:11.060
Their halter theory was the
leading option. For a long time.

14:11.477 --> 14:14.230
And the result?
- Waste of time.

14:16.107 --> 14:19.068
Except they were cut post mortem.

14:21.612 --> 14:25.700
No system?
- None, whatsoever.

14:28.369 --> 14:32.248
Jussi, this is not good for you.

14:32.832 --> 14:34.709
Let's go.

14:40.881 --> 14:44.885
Strange that the male victim looks
like a victim of a ritual murder.

14:45.052 --> 14:49.098
She, on the other hand, was killed
with one shot to the head.

14:49.265 --> 14:54.186
Strange, isn't it? - We had
this collateral damage theory.

14:54.395 --> 14:58.232
She was in the wrong place
at the wrong place.

14:58.482 --> 15:02.945
You were taking pictures
of the wallpaper!

15:03.112 --> 15:07.992
<i>Ruuhio must've forgotten his blood
pressure medication that morning.</i>

15:08.159 --> 15:13.080
<i>My feeling was that the house
kept most of its dark secrets.</i>

15:25.176 --> 15:27.803
Come with me. Right now!
You'll meet Sylvi.

15:27.970 --> 15:31.849
If that's a go, only one more thing
left before meeting the Council.

15:32.016 --> 15:35.061
What thing?
- You're too old to ask questions.

15:36.103 --> 15:40.941
You're not bringing that
into the car. You're not.

15:41.317 --> 15:44.904
Sorry that you missed your lunch.
But we're in a rush.

15:46.405 --> 15:51.494
Besides, it's not my car.
- Really?

15:52.995 --> 15:55.581
I can only use it
for VIP transportation.

15:55.831 --> 16:01.671
Am I one of those? A VIP?
- To me, you are.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.305
THE SALOON

16:16.143 --> 16:19.313
A bar that I haven't been in.
An exception to the rule.

16:19.480 --> 16:23.651
Sylvi is waiting. - What is
this lady's role in all this?

17:18.580 --> 17:20.458
Kekkonen.

17:24.670 --> 17:27.757
<i>Mu Kekkonen.</i>

17:28.007 --> 17:31.927
<i>What was this Bob-The-Builder-
look-alike? A janitor?</i>

17:32.053 --> 17:36.057
<i>Why was he called with the name
of the ex-president's wife?</i>

17:36.223 --> 17:38.059
Jussi Vares.

17:38.434 --> 17:43.356
Antidote told me about you.

17:47.651 --> 17:50.279
You're investigating
the double murder.

17:51.322 --> 17:55.659
You'd like to meet certain parties.

17:55.868 --> 18:01.374
That's right. Of course, that
depends on the parties in question.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.584
I hear you've studied law.

18:05.795 --> 18:12.718
Although I'm just a small-time
private entrepreneur, my ambition -

18:12.885 --> 18:19.517
has been not to contradict
the laws of this land very much.

18:25.815 --> 18:30.277
We're not doing anything fishy
in here. Nothing illegal.

18:33.489 --> 18:37.201
You already have an employer
concerning these homicides?

18:37.410 --> 18:39.078
Possibly.

18:40.079 --> 18:44.208
OK, I want everyone to know -

18:44.375 --> 18:50.548
that our parties want to play
with open cards.

18:51.048 --> 18:55.219
Understood.
- Right.

18:56.721 --> 18:59.598
As far as I'm concerned,
we're good to go.

18:59.807 --> 19:05.312
Further negotiations are
between you and the parties.

19:12.319 --> 19:16.699
Only one thing left.
An aptitude test.

19:18.743 --> 19:20.828
Part two.

19:23.289 --> 19:24.957
Jussi

19:26.709 --> 19:29.628
I didn't have time
to tell you everything.

19:32.548 --> 19:39.430
The dude we're about the see
handles our dirty work, so to speak.

19:40.723 --> 19:42.475
Is this a warning?

19:58.115 --> 20:02.995
Look at that.
Ms. Milla Magic noticed Mr. Vares.

20:03.454 --> 20:07.750
She's our computer whiz.
Ain't a machine she can't hack.

20:08.125 --> 20:11.087
Milla?
- Forget it.

20:11.587 --> 20:15.132
She and Harry Potter have
one thing in common.

20:15.466 --> 20:17.718
Which is?
- They both like girls.

20:43.828 --> 20:48.040
Here.
- Is this the test, part two?

21:14.734 --> 21:16.569
Hi, I'm Seppo.

21:16.861 --> 21:20.281
YOU CAN'T MAKE AN OMELETTE
WITHOUT BREAKING EGGS

21:20.656 --> 21:22.658
Mommy.

21:26.370 --> 21:28.789
I can't understand
what you're mumbling.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.335
And that's the Wolf.

21:33.753 --> 21:35.421
HI.

21:35.588 --> 21:38.841
PITY YOU GET' FOR FREE;
ENVY YOU HAVE TO EARN

21:43.679 --> 21:45.514
Seppo!

21:46.974 --> 21:49.477
Well, we forgot to brush the teeth!

21:49.769 --> 21:53.272
How about a kebab
after you're done?

21:53.522 --> 21:56.609
Antidote, get
our Tom Thumb from the car.

22:17.630 --> 22:20.466
What's this all about? Really.

22:20.633 --> 22:22.593
Why don't you quit your whining?

22:22.760 --> 22:25.137
Mercy... I haven't done anything...

22:25.846 --> 22:27.765
Let's go, girls.

22:30.142 --> 22:35.064
No point in being sad. You'll
get to keep your other thumb.

22:35.356 --> 22:38.275
The left one is better than nothing.

22:38.484 --> 22:42.071
You stay here. We'll have
a little chat with the canary bird.

22:43.030 --> 22:46.283
If you're gone when we come back,
you're a dead man.

22:46.617 --> 22:49.412
If you call the cops,
you're a dead man.

22:50.079 --> 22:53.749
If you ever mention this to anyone,
you're a very dead man.

22:54.792 --> 22:58.045
But if you stay put and behave,
we'll hire you.

22:58.254 --> 23:00.881
Dead man means...
- A dead man!

23:20.943 --> 23:23.696
<i>What was the game
for these guys?</i>

23:24.030 --> 23:27.324
Has this been sharpened
since the last time? - Yup.

23:29.452 --> 23:31.620
Get ready to burn the stub.

23:31.954 --> 23:35.499
<i>They were interested
in the homicides.</i>

23:35.666 --> 23:41.422
<i>So I had ta pass the test, although
I had zero idea what it meant.</i>

23:46.177 --> 23:50.348
Nice that we reached an agreement.

23:55.478 --> 23:58.397
A fine thing, that consensus.

24:42.024 --> 24:44.235
This is the holy of the holiest.

24:46.070 --> 24:48.114
The Sauna Club.

24:56.497 --> 24:58.207
Step right in.

25:09.301 --> 25:13.848
May I introduce;
private detective Vares.

25:14.390 --> 25:17.226
Jussi Vares.

25:18.310 --> 25:20.438
Please, take a seat.

25:32.116 --> 25:33.743
Something to drink?

25:33.826 --> 25:36.829
ONE FOR ME, ALL FOR ME

25:44.837 --> 25:47.256
This load is yours
for a hundred thousand.

25:47.423 --> 25:51.969
We deduct the forwarding fees
and the inflation rate. - Huh?

25:52.136 --> 25:56.515
That makes 95 thousand altogether.
Here's 5 thousand.

25:56.766 --> 25:58.768
My name is Kalle Shostakovitsh.

25:59.894 --> 26:02.688
You've already met
these two gentlemen.

26:03.022 --> 26:06.525
We are expecting our fourth
member any moment now.

26:09.403 --> 26:15.076
Here's a modest negotiation fee.
Compensation for coming here.

26:16.285 --> 26:18.287
No need for a receipt.

26:22.041 --> 26:28.339
We don't want to trouble
the overburdened tax authorities.

26:30.216 --> 26:32.051
We're aware -

26:32.218 --> 26:35.262
that you're investigating
the Swing Bride Murders.

26:35.429 --> 26:38.224
Our mutual wish is
that the truth would be found.

26:38.391 --> 26:41.102
Why are you so interested
in these homicides?

26:41.268 --> 26:44.563
We've been watching
from the sidelines -

26:44.730 --> 26:47.108
how the police get nowhere.

26:47.358 --> 26:51.946
An unsolved crime is unfortunate
for the welfare of society.

26:52.154 --> 26:54.782
Bad for business, for all.

26:56.784 --> 27:00.413
This could be our suggestion.

27:00.955 --> 27:03.708
The reward we're offering
is remarkable.

27:04.083 --> 27:07.044
But no results, no reward.

27:07.545 --> 27:10.840
Keep in contact
via Sylvi and Antidote.

27:18.973 --> 27:21.642
Before I even consider
the assignment, -

27:23.644 --> 27:25.855
I need to know your background.

27:28.024 --> 27:33.112
I'm in the importing business.

27:33.779 --> 27:36.782
I'm a real estate investor.

27:37.366 --> 27:42.496
I operate in many different areas.

27:43.205 --> 27:46.375
We have a fourth musketeer.

27:48.669 --> 27:51.380
What's up, sailors?

27:51.589 --> 27:54.800
A BOTTLE A DAY KEEPS
THE DOCTOR AWAY

28:00.389 --> 28:03.893
This dude is
one heck of a tough guy.

28:04.101 --> 28:07.813
Shit, these shoes are from Milan.

28:08.105 --> 28:13.486
I'll have a sip of this
if you don't mind.

28:14.820 --> 28:17.823
How's the Hulk?

28:21.952 --> 28:27.291
But you're not real seamen.

28:28.209 --> 28:31.921
The only water you've seen
is in your mother's eyes.

28:32.713 --> 28:36.967
Pekka, let's go.
- Seppo, you're a good dude.

28:37.134 --> 28:42.890
A real decent man.
One of the best.

28:43.015 --> 28:49.146
I appreciate you.
You're a real fine man...

28:49.313 --> 28:53.693
A small accident.
Happens to the best of us.

28:58.239 --> 29:02.785
Needless to say, we are all
honest businessmen.

29:03.452 --> 29:07.289
We expect the same from you
and your methods.

29:13.421 --> 29:19.010
<i>I had to accept the assignment.
The envelope was just too heavy.</i>

29:21.887 --> 29:23.889
God damn, you impressed them.

29:24.015 --> 29:28.102
They usually check the backgrounds,
starting from your grandmother.

29:28.269 --> 29:30.438
Half-a-year test period is normal.

29:30.604 --> 29:32.606
Can you drive me home?
- Of course.

29:32.815 --> 29:35.192
You have to celebrate this.
- I guess.

29:35.568 --> 29:38.738
I was afraid of them, too.
In the beginning.

31:07.284 --> 31:13.249
<i>'Post mortem,' after death.
But the message was from this world.</i>

31:13.374 --> 31:15.042
SEPÄNKUJA ALLEY 3

31:15.209 --> 31:17.294
<i>From an amateur, with an address.</i>

31:25.511 --> 31:29.890
<i>So I was drawn to the shady side
of town, to meet the sender.</i>

31:46.907 --> 31:49.827
<i>Why did I run after that creep?</i>

31:49.994 --> 31:52.455
<i>And what the hell
was wrong with him?</i>

31:52.621 --> 31:55.916
<i>My best guess is
some sort of conspiracy theory.</i>

31:57.335 --> 32:00.671
<i>You can get killed in many ways.
It wasn't my time, yet.</i>

32:00.880 --> 32:04.091
<i>Anneli's godfather seemed to be
out of this universe.</i>

32:04.258 --> 32:08.304
Sorry about that.
I thought you were someone else.

32:11.390 --> 32:14.018
Why such a message? "Post mortem."

32:14.226 --> 32:17.355
I had a theory the police never
wanted to hear.

32:17.480 --> 32:21.233
Let's hear it.
- The cuts, they're coordinates.

32:24.362 --> 32:27.865
The meridians lead
to the same point.

32:28.324 --> 32:35.289
<i>He went on with his theory;
UFOs, CIA, ex-presidents.</i>

32:35.456 --> 32:40.211
You've sold yourself to my sister.
Were you cheap?

32:40.753 --> 32:42.713
Can you sell yourself to me?

32:43.881 --> 32:46.217
I'll come to your place,
after death.

32:46.384 --> 32:50.721
Like Anneli comes to your dreams.

32:51.430 --> 32:55.059
We're all alike.
We have the death inside us.

32:55.351 --> 32:59.605
You're Riku's servant.
A gun-for-hire...

33:00.398 --> 33:04.276
<i>The boundaries of my employment
were stretching all the time.</i>

33:10.741 --> 33:13.828
Your brother attacked me
last night. With a chisel

33:14.370 --> 33:16.247
<i>Who's mu?</i>

33:20.209 --> 33:22.920
Riku aka Richard
is my other brother.

33:23.337 --> 33:26.716
All three of us were
Anneli's godparents.

33:26.924 --> 33:33.014
So Richard is my real employer?
What? Who's the money man?

33:33.431 --> 33:37.393
Richard pays your salary.
On my initiative, though.

33:40.062 --> 33:42.023
Niilo is broke.

33:42.273 --> 33:46.861
I barely get by with the modest
inheritance of my late husband.

33:48.195 --> 33:52.199
Assignments like this
are peanuts for Richard.

33:52.450 --> 33:55.161
Maybe I should have
a word with him.

33:55.369 --> 33:57.955
The males in this family
have a gene.

33:58.164 --> 34:00.750
My father called it
an insanity gene.

34:01.333 --> 34:06.297
My brothers are
between madmen and geniuses.

34:06.464 --> 34:08.674
That's pretty hard not to notice.

34:08.799 --> 34:13.137
Richard is over intelligent.
And can't bear to be with people.

34:14.263 --> 34:17.808
He loves solitude,
not to be disturbed.

34:18.100 --> 34:20.686
But I'll leave him a message.

34:20.811 --> 34:25.315
If it's one on his better days,
he might call back.

34:26.609 --> 34:28.819
Victor, please.

34:39.746 --> 34:42.583
Those dudes have
more additives in their bodies -

34:42.750 --> 34:44.418
than cheap sausages do.

34:44.585 --> 34:48.672
Is that right?
- Yes, Seppo told me.

34:50.132 --> 34:55.304
I hear they eat cauliflower.
Look what their ears look like.

34:56.222 --> 34:58.474
What do they look like?

35:00.643 --> 35:02.603
Cauliflower.

35:04.522 --> 35:07.566
Yippie-Kay-yay!

35:09.902 --> 35:14.782
Two Tom Collinses, boy!
- And fast!

35:18.953 --> 35:25.459
Don't be shy, hon.
I'll just feel you up.

35:25.668 --> 35:28.838
Gents, can you look
after our drinks.

35:29.005 --> 35:32.008
While we freshen up a bit.

35:44.979 --> 35:50.860
The young couple should
maybe take a break.

35:52.945 --> 35:56.615
This is almost too much.

36:14.133 --> 36:18.554
<i>A lady is a lady, no matter what.</i>

36:19.013 --> 36:21.140
Now that we belong
to the same club, -

36:21.307 --> 36:23.059
I'd like to introduce myself.

36:23.225 --> 36:27.813
Jussi Vares. - You're the private
investigator. The Maltese Falcon.

36:28.147 --> 36:34.904
I'm no Sam Spade. Just a domestic
version, made in the shade.

36:35.071 --> 36:36.822
Milla.

36:38.282 --> 36:40.159
See you around.

36:42.286 --> 36:47.208
This might sound a hit funny,
but do we know each other?

36:47.583 --> 36:52.171
I don't think so.
I'd know if we did.

36:53.464 --> 36:56.676
On the other hand,
I have nothing against it.

36:56.884 --> 37:00.471
Forget it. I thought
you were someone else.

37:09.230 --> 37:11.357
Suck it back in.

37:11.524 --> 37:15.277
And don't spit the cum
on my shoes; they're from Milan...

37:15.528 --> 37:18.656
<i>Getting a public blowjob
is no big deal.</i>

37:18.823 --> 37:21.450
<i>But this dude had
a gun in his hand.</i>

37:24.954 --> 37:30.418
That piece is a bit too much.
- No license for it, either.

37:30.751 --> 37:32.503
Who are you calling?
- Kalle.

37:32.670 --> 37:35.965
He's the only one
who can get the jerk back in line.

37:36.132 --> 37:39.593
Nothing's more dangerous
than a drunken bigmouth.

37:40.094 --> 37:42.805
Except a drunken junkie bigmouth.

37:43.139 --> 37:45.016
Girls!

37:46.475 --> 37:48.811
The famous private investigator!

37:49.812 --> 37:56.736
What are we paying you for?
Right. The case of the Shield Man.

37:56.944 --> 38:02.116
Shut up, Pekka.
- You shut up, you dickless creep.

38:02.408 --> 38:07.455
So, are you up to the job?
Vares? You're not talking to me.

38:07.913 --> 38:11.917
Have I done something to you?
Eaten your lunch?

38:12.084 --> 38:14.962
I have to call Kalle now.

38:15.296 --> 38:20.468
You're so fucking weird
that you must be gay.

38:21.344 --> 38:24.889
Go ahead, call Kalle.

38:25.848 --> 38:31.312
I'll talk to the other limp dick.
Man-to-man-talk.

38:32.480 --> 38:37.109
You're so dickless. That's
painted all over your faggot face.

38:38.819 --> 38:47.578
How about a little dance?
I'll teach you how to tap-dance.

38:50.331 --> 38:51.916
Hey, babe...

39:00.132 --> 39:07.390
No man has ever hit me that hard!
- Calm down. It's OK.

39:07.556 --> 39:09.183
Just take deep breaths.

39:09.392 --> 39:17.733
Felt like I went to the other side.
At least my dick's length.

39:17.900 --> 39:20.486
What did you see over there?

39:20.653 --> 39:26.951
Nothing. Cause the dick
only has one, blind eye.

39:27.785 --> 39:34.125
Our doc's prognosis is not good;
I will survive!

39:35.918 --> 39:40.047
Rehab is the best option now.

39:40.506 --> 39:43.718
I've heard that you know a place
with a good reputation.

39:43.884 --> 39:48.347
Very convenient. Small groups.
Therapy, peaceful location.

39:48.723 --> 39:52.351
But not a cheap one.
- Money is not an issue here.

39:52.768 --> 39:56.230
Can you see that he gets
transferred? With discretion.

39:56.439 --> 40:00.860
And anonymity?
And money's not an issue? - No.

40:01.652 --> 40:04.196
Not in this case, either.

40:06.782 --> 40:09.869
<i>This was not the first time
Onni was carrying Pekka -</i>

40:10.077 --> 40:12.079
<i>on his shoulders.</i>

40:48.074 --> 40:50.117
I need to talk to you.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.419
What's this Shield Man crap?

41:03.047 --> 41:05.966
Doesn't that mean a messenger?

41:06.133 --> 41:09.970
A go-between, when the boss
wants to be anonymous.

41:12.056 --> 41:15.976
In this case, between
The Council and the real boss.

41:24.485 --> 41:27.154
Was the ex-cop the Shield Man?

41:27.613 --> 41:31.117
Or, maybe,
Anneli was the Shield Woman?

41:31.742 --> 41:34.954
Jussi, walk softly as fuck now.

41:35.079 --> 41:38.332
A human life means nothing
to the Council.

41:46.132 --> 41:48.009
How well did you check-

41:48.134 --> 41:50.469
the background
of the female victim?

41:50.636 --> 41:53.264
She ran a very successful
accounting agency.

41:53.472 --> 41:56.475
Impeccable reputation.
- How about the customers?

41:56.642 --> 42:00.521
Respectable companies.
Local, national, even international

42:00.688 --> 42:04.316
Tax-paying, solvent, legitimate
firms. What else can I say?

42:04.525 --> 42:06.110
You have a list of them?

42:06.277 --> 42:08.779
After she died,
the company went belly up.

42:08.946 --> 42:12.283
The papers were in a warehouse
that burned down.

42:12.491 --> 42:15.286
An arson?
- A gas accident.

42:17.496 --> 42:22.001
Isn't that a bit strange? - Why
don't you call the Ghostbusters?

42:22.126 --> 42:26.380
But what if she was the real target
and the ex-cop just a diversion?

42:26.630 --> 42:30.134
We had the same thought.
But that trail went dead cold.

42:30.343 --> 42:32.553
No evidence, no motive.

42:32.762 --> 42:35.181
How about
the Financial Crimes Unit?

42:36.223 --> 42:41.062
She was the Entrepreneur of the Year
here two years ago.

42:41.228 --> 42:44.565
This is homicide,
not a white-collar misdemeanor.

42:44.732 --> 42:48.277
I know. Did you check
the customers? - Yes.

42:48.652 --> 42:52.990
And half of the local population.
- Maybe that was the wrong half.

42:53.157 --> 42:58.454
Get the hell out of here, Vares!
Or I'll call the cops!

43:04.377 --> 43:06.921
<i>The warehouse was easy to find.</i>

43:07.129 --> 43:11.717
<i>The only burned-down Wooden
house in recent years.</i>

43:25.773 --> 43:30.319
<i>It wasn't a coincidence that the
remains of the accounting company -</i>

43:30.444 --> 43:33.572
<i>were burned down so conveniently.</i>

44:06.313 --> 44:08.065
Hello.

44:10.985 --> 44:12.903
Hello!

44:36.886 --> 44:38.763
ACCOUNTING COMPANY VALKAMA

45:05.539 --> 45:10.294
<i>Hard to imagine how much stuff
you can have in seven memory sticks.</i>

45:11.128 --> 45:17.176
<i>The bookkeeping was as boring
as in my ancient university days.</i>

45:19.970 --> 45:23.182
ACCOUNTING COMPANY VALKAMA
Current Account Ledger

45:23.265 --> 45:25.476
CUTS ON THE VICTIM'S BODY:
RANDOM OR MEANINGFUL?

45:25.559 --> 45:27.186
THE SHIELD WOMAN?
COORDINATES?

45:28.020 --> 45:30.314
Doc, more shit!

45:44.161 --> 45:48.207
Who the fuck is there?
Who's playing games?

45:55.381 --> 45:57.008
Fuck.

46:30.833 --> 46:33.127
Shit.
Going cold turkey ain't fun...

47:24.929 --> 47:28.140
<i>it all seemed familiar.
The nightmares.</i>

47:28.307 --> 47:30.935
<i>But this time
I found something new.</i>

47:41.404 --> 47:44.115
Account Ledger. Invoicing.

48:06.137 --> 48:09.098
Symphonies. Shostakovitsh.

48:11.934 --> 48:14.395
I have a few questions.

48:14.979 --> 48:18.190
Some of them
might be a bit intrusive.

48:20.151 --> 48:21.944
Victor.

48:29.118 --> 48:31.996
Is it possible
that Anneli's business had ties -

48:32.163 --> 48:33.831
to the underworld?

48:34.040 --> 48:37.585
Does the name Kalle Shostakovitsh
mean anything to you?

48:38.461 --> 48:40.171
I have reason to suspect -

48:40.504 --> 48:44.550
that some of her clients
had ties with illegal activities.

48:44.800 --> 48:49.388
The reason I'm saying this
is that I have to dig deeper.

48:49.555 --> 48:51.474
Who knows what I'll find.

48:51.640 --> 48:53.684
Is this what we're paying you for?

48:53.851 --> 48:57.938
Destroying her reputation? - You
hired me, to investigate her death.

48:58.939 --> 49:03.152
Maybe she didn't die without
a reason like everyone assumes.

49:03.277 --> 49:08.240
If any of this goes public,
I'll contact my lawyers.

49:08.366 --> 49:11.577
Restrain yourself
from all further actions.

49:11.744 --> 49:16.374
I have to talk to my brother
about terminating your employment.

49:27.718 --> 49:29.720
Antidote?

49:42.858 --> 49:48.906
You all know Koskenlaskija. If not
personally, at least by the name.

49:50.616 --> 49:56.372
He is the 4th member
of the Council.

49:59.041 --> 50:03.087
Irreplaceable. Unique.

50:06.424 --> 50:12.388
It is my sad duty to inform you
that he's not with us any more.

50:12.596 --> 50:14.432
We just found out.

50:14.557 --> 50:17.810
A professional hit.
One shot, to the head.

50:18.894 --> 50:22.606
I appeal to you all.

50:23.190 --> 50:27.194
I need to hear
even the smallest details -

50:27.361 --> 50:30.865
that can shed light on this.

50:32.450 --> 50:36.412
Maybe a dealer?
Or someone from the dope gangs?

50:36.579 --> 50:41.042
Unlikely. The MO is different
from drug-related killings.

50:41.208 --> 50:46.505
Rather an assassin. - Our source
tells us his dear watch was stolen.

50:46.714 --> 50:51.344
I'd like to remind you
that it was a SO-grand watch.

50:52.345 --> 50:57.391
The speed freaks and smack users
are the main suspects in my book.

51:00.519 --> 51:05.191
Yes? - Was the hit aimed at him
or maybe towards the Council?

51:07.610 --> 51:12.573
A relevant question.
We have to consider all options.

51:12.698 --> 51:16.660
Maybe an outsider
is penetrating here.

51:17.620 --> 51:21.207
And that scenario concerns us all.

51:23.209 --> 51:27.213
And we have hired
a professional to investigate this.

51:36.222 --> 51:42.228
This is Jussi Vares. Working
under the control of the Council.

51:42.770 --> 51:45.856
All possible help to this dude.

51:47.441 --> 51:51.320
We are now at war.
A war against unknown.

51:52.279 --> 51:59.787
The enemy can be anywhere,
anytime, anyone.

52:02.957 --> 52:04.750
The drinks are on the house.

52:06.627 --> 52:10.881
Come to the Thai boxing with me.
To relieve your tensions.

52:11.757 --> 52:15.594
I have no tensions.

52:17.013 --> 52:20.391
Or if I do,
boxing won't relieve them.

52:20.599 --> 52:22.435
What will?

52:28.190 --> 52:32.820
Talking about tensions, I'll go
shake hands with the unemployed.

52:32.945 --> 52:34.613
A lot of them here.

52:35.823 --> 52:41.996
<i>Men at my age need certain relief.
Timing was lucky this time.</i>

53:04.643 --> 53:10.983
The word on the street is
that the killer is a woman.

53:12.318 --> 53:14.320
Let's have a beer.

53:52.108 --> 53:53.984
A DRINK TONIGHT?
JV

54:57.214 --> 55:02.219
It's in the new Seven Days
magazine. In the centerfold.

55:09.435 --> 55:12.980
Where the fuck is it?
- It was right there.

55:13.147 --> 55:15.066
The Wolf will go berserk.

55:16.067 --> 55:19.695
Bloody hell.
What are we going to do now?

55:22.239 --> 55:24.408
Let's get out of here.

55:30.081 --> 55:32.124
They're OK when things go smooth.

55:32.333 --> 55:34.710
But when the going gets tough,
like now, -

55:34.877 --> 55:37.880
it's hard on their nerves.
Keep that in mind.

55:38.255 --> 55:40.257
Ru try.

55:40.424 --> 55:47.264
Have they ever talked about me?
The Council? Sylvi? Antidote?

55:47.515 --> 55:50.226
People always talk
about women like you.

55:51.102 --> 55:53.771
Your likings and preferences.

55:54.397 --> 55:56.232
Here we go.

55:56.399 --> 56:00.861
Do you know what Harry Potter and
Milla Motorcycle have in common?

56:01.070 --> 56:02.822
Not a clue.

56:02.988 --> 56:06.575
They both like girls.
- Doesn't seem to bother you.

56:08.202 --> 56:11.288
I hear you have a project.
- Yep.

56:11.706 --> 56:13.541
What sort of project?

56:15.918 --> 56:19.797
That sort that when it's over,
it's better to disappear.

56:22.591 --> 56:25.428
Does the word 'Sheriff'
mean anything to you?

56:27.513 --> 56:31.600
What is this mysterious Sheriff?
The real boss of the Council?

56:31.767 --> 56:34.020
The Grey eminence?
The invisible man?

56:34.228 --> 56:37.231
He's someone you don't talk about.

56:39.316 --> 56:42.695
People do talk about him.
- No one knows.

56:42.903 --> 56:45.489
Now, the time for talking is over.

57:00.671 --> 57:03.049
Oh my God.

57:13.684 --> 57:16.771
Now we've investigated
your preferences.

57:17.813 --> 57:22.568
Had to invent a camouflage
among all those macho types.

57:24.612 --> 57:28.532
Talking about them, the Sheriff.

57:31.535 --> 57:35.915
The less you know, the better.
Knowledge is pain.

57:36.290 --> 57:37.958
Can be.

57:38.167 --> 57:39.877
My theory is -

57:40.961 --> 57:45.591
that the death of the Shield Woman
destroyed the relations.

57:45.841 --> 57:48.761
The Council got greedy.

57:49.053 --> 57:53.766
It lifted the loan shark interest
rate sky high. Right?

57:55.601 --> 57:59.397
I also have a personal question.
- OK. Spit it out.

58:00.314 --> 58:02.608
Did you kill Koskenlaskija?

58:05.778 --> 58:08.698
Is that the word on the streets?
- Yep.

58:08.864 --> 58:11.367
Independent women have
always scared men.

58:11.617 --> 58:13.536
But did you kill him?

58:16.956 --> 58:18.791
What do you think?

58:20.876 --> 58:22.753
Wait a second.

58:24.714 --> 58:28.009
No?
- Of course not.

58:30.636 --> 58:34.765
I also have a question.
- Mm?

58:39.353 --> 58:41.188
Don't you really remember me?

58:41.355 --> 58:43.607
Where have we bumped
into each other?

58:43.774 --> 58:47.028
Bumping is the right word.
Humping is even better.

58:48.112 --> 58:51.657
This is not the first time
we're in bed. - No kidding.

58:51.866 --> 58:53.451
Oh yes.

58:54.702 --> 59:02.084
I was a freshman at the University.
You had been there for ages.

59:02.960 --> 59:04.920
Oh, the pain of this.

59:05.713 --> 59:08.716
A woman always thinks
she will be remembered.

59:08.883 --> 59:10.843
But you are!

59:11.302 --> 59:13.763
Yeah, until the next time.

59:53.177 --> 59:57.640
<i>'You respect me."
The signature of an artist.</i>

59:58.391 --> 01:00:01.268
<i>Cheap - but useful.</i>

01:00:01.435 --> 01:00:03.479
THE SHERIFF!

01:00:12.238 --> 01:00:13.948
Hey"

01:00:16.575 --> 01:00:19.203
A hell of a way to die.

01:00:21.455 --> 01:00:27.378
I always thought
it doesn't matter how you die.

01:00:28.295 --> 01:00:30.756
What matters is how you live.

01:00:34.844 --> 01:00:37.179
I have something
I have to transport.

01:00:37.304 --> 01:00:39.557
And I don't want to use
a Council car.

01:00:39.765 --> 01:00:42.727
I feel I have to keep some distance.

01:00:44.478 --> 01:00:50.609
So you'd like to borrow
my proud Swedish wheels? - Yes.

01:00:53.571 --> 01:00:58.242
Your wish is my command.

01:00:58.909 --> 01:01:01.328
I'll be at the motorcycle club
all day.

01:01:01.495 --> 01:01:04.623
Can you drop the car there?
- Sure.

01:01:12.173 --> 01:01:16.969
Plan your next move carefully.

01:01:18.054 --> 01:01:24.018
If I were you, I'd keep some things
to myself. A friendly advice.

01:01:25.227 --> 01:01:27.605
I see. But guess what?

01:01:28.898 --> 01:01:31.817
This is something
I'm not keeping to myself...

01:01:49.126 --> 01:01:51.671
<i>Anneli had ordered
the Customize-d posters -</i>

01:01:51.879 --> 01:01:53.964
<i>from her half-med Godfather.</i>

01:01:54.131 --> 01:01:57.218
<i>He had more personalities
than hairstyles.</i>

01:01:58.469 --> 01:02:02.306
Like the old saying goes: there's
a time and place for everything.

01:02:02.431 --> 01:02:05.601
But this guy was an exception.
Out of place, anywhere.

01:02:07.978 --> 01:02:10.022
I'm just having fun.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.275
What's up?

01:02:17.405 --> 01:02:19.073
What about that?

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:23.536
The belt buckle had initials.
Your initials.

01:02:24.453 --> 01:02:26.414
The signature is the only thing -

01:02:26.539 --> 01:02:29.917
an artist leaves behind
after he dies -

01:02:30.084 --> 01:02:32.461
and the casket is closed.

01:02:33.045 --> 01:02:36.924
<i>And, as I had predicted, the artist
was a victim of his goddaughter.</i>

01:02:37.383 --> 01:02:43.389
You love me. You respect me.
You fear me.'

01:02:44.515 --> 01:02:46.392
Are there others?

01:02:47.393 --> 01:02:49.437
You owe me.

01:02:50.062 --> 01:02:51.939
Thanks.

01:03:15.421 --> 01:03:17.923
<i>Visual arts
were not my specialty.</i>

01:03:18.758 --> 01:03:22.136
<i>But I was sure
that those cuts meant something.</i>

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:44.116
Here we are.

01:03:48.496 --> 01:03:50.873
The moment of truth.

01:03:58.422 --> 01:04:01.759
Looks real to me.

01:04:03.719 --> 01:04:05.346
Burn it.

01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:09.266
Burn it!

01:04:23.364 --> 01:04:26.283
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

01:04:37.837 --> 01:04:39.839
What was that all about?

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.552
A burn-down.

01:04:45.678 --> 01:04:49.015
I need to talk to the Council.
- Not a good day for that.

01:04:49.181 --> 01:04:52.143
The gents are a hit restless.
- I can show results.

01:04:56.022 --> 01:05:01.485
Sorry I got you into this.
Give up your assignment. I mean it.

01:05:01.694 --> 01:05:03.988
I know who killed Anneli Valkama.

01:05:06.365 --> 01:05:09.243
Tonight we have the wake
for our departed member.

01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:11.078
My condolences.

01:05:11.245 --> 01:05:14.415
We only have limited time.
- I understand.

01:05:17.752 --> 01:05:22.590
The real target of the murders was
not the ex-cop. - Please, continue.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:28.220
The target was Anneli Valkama.
- What makes you believe so?

01:05:28.512 --> 01:05:34.185
She was a crucial part of
your organization. Irreplaceable.

01:05:38.522 --> 01:05:44.028
Even if you were right,
you haven't told us who did it.

01:05:45.738 --> 01:05:47.907
When I found Salomaa's body, -

01:05:48.157 --> 01:05:51.243
his chest was
full of strange carvings.

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:55.581
Cuts here, cuts there.

01:05:57.666 --> 01:06:01.253
After re-organizing them a bit,
a strange thing happened.

01:06:02.046 --> 01:06:04.048
They formed a symbol.

01:06:05.341 --> 01:06:09.553
A star. So what?
- A sheriff's star.

01:06:10.096 --> 01:06:15.101
Can that mean... - Hell,
how come we didn't get that?

01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:17.687
Shut up. Boys!

01:06:26.862 --> 01:06:28.656
Onni.

01:06:31.992 --> 01:06:37.748
Mr. Vares, I'm sure you understand
how serious your accusations are.

01:06:37.915 --> 01:06:40.459
If I'm asked
to investigate a homicide, -

01:06:40.626 --> 01:06:42.378
that's exactly what I'll do.

01:06:42.545 --> 01:06:45.506
We don't know
the identity of the Sheriff.

01:06:45.715 --> 01:06:49.427
You'll get paid
when you find out who he is, -

01:06:49.593 --> 01:06:54.223
not a second before that.
- And now, get the fuck out.

01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:01.981
Are you tired of living?

01:07:02.189 --> 01:07:05.276
What are you doing? - Exactly
what they wanted me to do.

01:07:05.443 --> 01:07:08.320
Can't you see that the Sheriff
can be one of them?

01:07:08.654 --> 01:07:11.991
That's the way it goes.

01:07:12.450 --> 01:07:15.661
And now he has a really good reason
to get rid of you.

01:07:15.828 --> 01:07:22.209
Hell, I warned you. - If you take
a job, you have to finish it.

01:07:55.242 --> 01:07:56.911
Hi.

01:07:57.828 --> 01:08:00.664
What's up?
- Let's carry that to the car.

01:08:08.297 --> 01:08:10.966
What do you have in here? Bricks?
- Hard drives.

01:08:11.175 --> 01:08:12.760
Right.

01:08:32.029 --> 01:08:35.573
You OK?
- Never better.

01:08:52.925 --> 01:08:57.555
<i>I was late. My friends had
already started without me.</i>

01:08:58.389 --> 01:09:01.684
The Eldorado
of intoxication is waiting.

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:06.147
The Shangri-la of alcohol is here.

01:09:06.814 --> 01:09:10.568
The epic euphoria of brandy
lingers on.

01:09:11.986 --> 01:09:16.573
Five-point hint. - Fred Zinnemann,
1952. Olympic year.

01:09:16.866 --> 01:09:20.536
4 Oscars. First "real time" movie.

01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:23.622
Cooper plays the sheriff,
abandoned by everyone.

01:09:23.788 --> 01:09:26.250
In the end he's all alone.
- Is that right?

01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:28.461
He's right.

01:09:28.627 --> 01:09:31.839
If the poster is my symbol,
what would I be like?

01:09:33.466 --> 01:09:36.676
Someone wanting to be cool.

01:09:37.928 --> 01:09:41.390
Or someone who thinks
the whole world is against him.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.604
The whole world is against him."

01:09:49.064 --> 01:09:54.987
God damn, that makes sense.
- What did I say? The Shangri-la!

01:12:23.886 --> 01:12:26.305
Just thinking about Pekka.

01:12:30.059 --> 01:12:32.144
I found this at the door.

01:12:39.151 --> 01:12:41.195
Who brought these?

01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:44.198
Not a clue.

01:12:57.461 --> 01:13:01.007
The drinks for the wake
all taken care of.

01:13:09.306 --> 01:13:15.187
The creep here is selling Pekka's
watch. It's you. Can you explain?

01:13:15.563 --> 01:13:24.238
I admit, but I found
the watch in my car. It's true.

01:13:24.572 --> 01:13:27.241
What a nerve. Fuck!

01:13:58.773 --> 01:14:03.903
May I ask what you're doing here?
- I'd like to meet my employer.

01:14:04.236 --> 01:14:10.576
Ex-employer. You mean
Mrs. Valkama? - No, Richard Rantala.

01:14:10.826 --> 01:14:13.162
He doesn't live here.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.165
I must ask you to leave.

01:14:19.335 --> 01:14:21.003
<i>Vares.</i>

01:14:22.213 --> 01:14:24.256
In the hicks, why?

01:14:31.222 --> 01:14:35.059
That tape is useless.
Doesn't even stop the noise.

01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:40.940
The Department of Pathology.
Why are we here?

01:14:50.908 --> 01:14:53.202
<i>Does the name km
mean anything tn you?</i>

01:14:54.161 --> 01:14:56.706
<i>Anki Salmenautio?
- Never heard.</i>

01:14:56.872 --> 01:15:01.252
You know her better as Milla.

01:15:18.686 --> 01:15:21.063
I did know Milla.

01:15:21.605 --> 01:15:27.403
A strike from the underworld.
They didn't spare the bullets.

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:29.947
The bullets were meant for me.

01:15:32.074 --> 01:15:35.327
I signed her death penalty.

01:15:35.578 --> 01:15:41.167
Anki was one of us.
She knew the dangers.

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:48.883
Lieutenant Salmenautio. Ex-Central
Crime Police, ex-Special Branch.

01:15:49.717 --> 01:15:54.722
Law degree.
On a temporary assignment here.

01:15:55.723 --> 01:15:59.769
To infiltrate the inner circles
of the organized crime.

01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:27.963
Maybe we should call Kalle first?
- whose side are you on?

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:31.008
The Sheriff or the Council?
- Give me a break.

01:16:32.593 --> 01:16:37.890
I'm asking you and you are
answering. - Stop this, please.

01:16:38.974 --> 01:16:41.644
The Sheriff is taking
the Council down.

01:16:41.811 --> 01:16:44.814
But it's going to he vice versa.
Right, Wolf?

01:16:46.273 --> 01:16:50.653
Stay here. Keep your eyes open.
I'm going to get rid of the Wolf.

01:16:57.993 --> 01:16:59.662
Seppo?

01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:58.054
Kalle?
- What?

01:18:00.723 --> 01:18:02.558
What the hell?

01:18:02.725 --> 01:18:05.978
Seppo has gone mad.
Antidote sent me a message.

01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:11.859
We must go. Knowing Seppo,
there's only one place they can be.

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.751
Wolf, turn around.

01:18:33.089 --> 01:18:34.882
On your knees.

01:18:37.343 --> 01:18:39.345
Say Your prayers.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.151
Amen.

01:20:18.444 --> 01:20:20.237
Richard!

01:20:26.702 --> 01:20:28.704
Richard?

01:20:29.705 --> 01:20:33.250
Good evening, Sheriff.

01:20:42.468 --> 01:20:44.470
Jussi Vares.

01:20:45.012 --> 01:20:47.306
And still alive.

01:20:47.682 --> 01:20:51.477
Strange.
I thought I got rid of you.

01:20:52.353 --> 01:20:54.480
But I was mistaken.

01:20:57.191 --> 01:21:03.114
Mediocrity is contagious.
It spreads like a forest fire.

01:21:03.364 --> 01:21:05.616
Sticks like a disease.

01:21:06.283 --> 01:21:09.870
Anneli, for example.

01:21:11.038 --> 01:21:13.332
A decent money launderer, -

01:21:13.541 --> 01:21:16.877
a mediocre shield man
but a bad blackmailer.

01:21:17.378 --> 01:21:21.882
In the end, a very limited person.

01:21:22.258 --> 01:21:27.680
By telling tales, she also got
her ex-husband killed. How stupid.

01:21:28.264 --> 01:21:32.601
The Council, as a concept,
was not mediocre.

01:21:32.852 --> 01:21:38.524
Well administrated,
a good executive organ.

01:21:38.774 --> 01:21:41.027
But only, if well controlled -

01:21:42.653 --> 01:21:45.740
and if the members
don't take privileges.

01:21:48.743 --> 01:21:51.537
Holy Mediocrity.

01:21:53.247 --> 01:21:59.045
You all turned your backs
on the Sheriff, the perfect concept.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.798
You were nothing without me.

01:22:03.674 --> 01:22:06.177
That's why it was
only a matter of time.

01:22:07.094 --> 01:22:11.891
The Council had to be taken down.
You signed your own fate.

01:22:12.266 --> 01:22:16.395
Kalle, I'm afraid that is empty.

01:22:16.604 --> 01:22:22.318
Even mediocre people know
something. Basic mathematics.

01:22:22.568 --> 01:22:25.571
Five minus four is one.

01:22:27.656 --> 01:22:30.326
And that one is enough for me.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.206
<i>An ubermensch complex
or schizophrenia? Don't know.</i>

01:22:35.456 --> 01:22:39.585
<i>But there was something brilliant
about the Sheriff's double life.</i>

01:22:39.752 --> 01:22:42.254
<i>A master and a spy,
in the same persona.</i>

01:22:43.756 --> 01:22:50.554
<i>I knew perfectly well
that I was contradicting the law.</i>

01:22:50.721 --> 01:22:54.433
<i>But at the moment,
it felt like the only thing to do.</i>

01:23:10.741 --> 01:23:16.956
When the printer is out of ink,
and the keypad is disfunctioning.

01:23:17.164 --> 01:23:20.376
Very hard for a writer.

01:23:20.626 --> 01:23:24.505
Creativity is stuck before it's
started? - That's the way it goes!

01:23:24.672 --> 01:23:28.759
Don't worry, I'll give you
my old laptop. The keypad works.

01:23:28.926 --> 01:23:34.015
Don't worry. No rush.
- You'll get to work.

01:23:34.473 --> 01:23:38.602
I'm not in a rush,
my deadline is far away.

01:23:55.411 --> 01:23:57.830
LOCAL HERMIT MILLIONAIRE
MISSING

01:23:58.289 --> 01:24:02.376
The poster trade seems to be risky.
- Most likely.

01:24:03.085 --> 01:24:06.088
My focus is nowadays
on the other lines of business.

01:24:06.297 --> 01:24:08.257
Like?
- I just bought a pig farm.

01:24:13.971 --> 01:24:18.642
You have
a lot of discreet information -

01:24:18.809 --> 01:24:21.103
about me and my businesses.

01:24:21.312 --> 01:24:23.814
I told the police what I saw fit.

01:24:24.607 --> 01:24:27.443
The wheels are rolling.
The caravan is moving on.

01:24:28.444 --> 01:24:32.531
I'm still at large.
- You are. But for how long?

01:24:33.324 --> 01:24:36.827
This is a small town.
- But Russia is a big country.

01:24:37.036 --> 01:24:41.332
My plan is to expand
the farming activities over there.

01:24:46.879 --> 01:24:48.547
No thanks.

01:24:48.923 --> 01:24:52.009
Rantala's Secretary paid me
a generous advantage.

01:24:52.218 --> 01:24:53.886
I'm keeping it.

01:24:57.515 --> 01:25:00.893
First time in my career
when the murderer paid my fee.

01:25:01.102 --> 01:25:04.897
When you once step
on the gray zone, -

01:25:05.690 --> 01:25:07.733
the next time is much easier.

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:11.946
Can be. But I'll try to stay
on the narrow path.

01:25:12.113 --> 01:25:14.949
Between us, that path is so boring.

01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:21.831
Small advice, for a talented man.

01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:28.587
The new sheriffs will
always need new councils.

01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:39.140
Who was that dude?

01:25:39.348 --> 01:25:41.684
Someone selling magazines.

01:25:41.892 --> 01:25:45.980
Offered me a farming magazine. - An
urban warrior has no need for that.

01:25:46.147 --> 01:25:48.107
No. But how about?
- OK!

01:25:48.315 --> 01:25:50.317
I'm buying! - Doubles!
- Of course.
