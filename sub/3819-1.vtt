WEBVTT

00:47.240 --> 00:48.340
It started with a chair.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.540
I've wanted this
for a really long time.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.140
I know.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.540
Wizard.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.340
Jeez Banana,
shut your freakin' gob OK?

01:35.540 --> 01:39.940
This is the most magnificent discarded
living room set I've ever seen.

04:10.740 --> 04:13.140
Well, well, if it isn't
MacGuff the Crime Dog.

04:13.640 --> 04:14.540
Back for another test?

04:16.440 --> 04:17.840
I think the first one was defective,

04:18.340 --> 04:21.240
The plus sign looks more like a
division symbol, so I remain unconvinced.

04:23.540 --> 04:27.640
Third test today, Momma Bear, your
eggo's preggo, no doubt about it.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.540
It's really easy to tell,
is your nipples real brown?

04:31.240 --> 04:34.940
Yeah, maybe your little boyfriend's
got mutant sperms, knocked you up twice.

04:35.440 --> 04:40.340
Silencio, old man. Look, I just drank my
weight in SunnyD and I gotta go pronto.

04:41.840 --> 04:42.940
Well, you know where the lavatory is.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.740
Pay for that pee stick when you're done.

04:47.940 --> 04:50.440
Don't think it's yours just 'cause
you marked it with your urine.

05:20.540 --> 05:23.040
What's the prognosis,
Fertile Myrtle: Minus or plus?

05:23.740 --> 05:25.140
I don't know, it's not seasoned yet.

05:26.940 --> 05:27.740
I'll take some of these.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.440
There it is.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.240
The little pink plus sign is so unholy.

05:39.840 --> 05:44.040
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch, this is one
doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.240
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.

07:09.040 --> 07:09.840
I'm a suicide risk.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.140
Juno?

07:11.540 --> 07:14.040
No, it's Morgan Freeman, do you
have any bones that need collecting?

07:14.740 --> 07:17.340
Only the one in my pants.

07:19.040 --> 07:19.940
I'm pregnant.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.940
What? Honest to blog?

07:22.340 --> 07:23.940
Yeah, it's Bleeker's.

07:24.540 --> 07:27.540
It's probably just a food
baby, did you have a big lunch?

07:28.140 --> 07:33.340
This is not a food baby, I've taken three
pregnancy tests and I am fo' shiz up the spout.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.240
How did you even generate enough pee for
three pregnancy tests? That's amazing.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.140
I don't know, I drank
like ten tons of SunnyD.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.640
I'm telling you I'm pregnant and
you're acting shockingly cavalier.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.140
Is this for real?
Like for real for real?

07:51.040 --> 07:52.240
Unfortunately yes.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.840
Oh, my God!

07:56.440 --> 07:58.840
Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!

07:59.540 --> 08:02.940
That was kind of the emotion that I
was searching for on the first take.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.440
Are you going to
Havenbrook or Women Now?

08:05.440 --> 08:08.140
You need a note from your
parents for Havenbrook.

08:08.540 --> 08:13.040
Yeah, I know. No, I'm going to go to Women
Now, just 'cause they help out women now.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.740
Do you want me to call for you?
Because I called for Becky last year.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.040
No, I can call myself.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.940
Oh, but I do need your help with
something, it's like critically important.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.940
You know, heavy lifting can
really only help you at this point.

08:25.840 --> 08:26.640
Seriously.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.240
So, you were bored? That's how
this blessed miracle came to be?

08:30.540 --> 08:34.840
No, the act was premeditated. I mean, the
sex, not the whole "let's get pregnant" thing.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.240
So, when did you decide that
you were gonna do Bleeker?

08:41.740 --> 08:42.340
I don't know.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.640
A year ago in Spanish class.

08:49.240 --> 08:49.940
You love him.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.940
It's actually really complicated, OK?

08:56.540 --> 09:00.240
And I don't feel like talking
about it in my fragile state.

09:01.740 --> 09:02.540
So what was it like?

09:03.340 --> 09:04.640
Humping Bleek's bony bod?

09:05.940 --> 09:07.040
Magnificent.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.140
Hey, Bleek.

09:48.740 --> 09:49.540
Wicked tiger.

09:50.540 --> 09:51.340
It looks proud.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.140
I swiped it from Ms. Rancick's lawn.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.840
Wow, your shorts are like
especially gold today.

09:59.540 --> 10:01.040
My mom uses color-safe bleach.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.740
Go Carole.

10:04.340 --> 10:05.040
I'll tell her.

10:09.540 --> 10:12.840
When I see them all running like that, with
their things bouncing around in their shorts,

10:13.240 --> 10:17.340
I always picture them naked, even if I
don't want to, all I see is pork swords.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.240
I'm supposed to be running.

10:21.940 --> 10:22.540
So guess what.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.140
What? I don't know.

10:27.440 --> 10:28.140
I'm pregnant.

10:40.140 --> 10:40.940
What should we do?

10:44.040 --> 10:49.740
Oh, you know, I was thinking I'd just
nip it in the bud before it gets worse.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.840
Because they were talking
about it in health class,

10:54.040 --> 10:56.140
how pregnancy can
often lead to an infant.

10:56.940 --> 10:57.740
Typically, yeah, yeah.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.440
That's what happens when our
moms and teachers get pregnant.

11:05.140 --> 11:06.540
So, you're cool with that then?

11:07.740 --> 11:10.140
Yeah, yeah, wizard. You know,

11:11.240 --> 11:13.140
do whatever you think
you should do, you know?

11:18.740 --> 11:19.840
Well, I'm sorry I had sex with you,

11:21.340 --> 11:22.740
I know it wasn't your idea.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.040
Whose idea was it?

11:26.540 --> 11:27.940
I'll see you at school, alright?

11:32.240 --> 11:33.140
Whose idea was it?

12:00.740 --> 12:01.640
Hey, your book fell apart.

12:02.740 --> 12:03.440
Right.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.140
It must have looked at your face.

12:08.340 --> 12:11.040
The funny thing is that Steve
Rendazo secretly wants me.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.640
Jocks like him always want freaky girls.

12:14.140 --> 12:18.440
Girls with horn-rimmed glasses
and vegan footwear and Goth makeup.

12:19.540 --> 12:22.240
Girls who play the cello
and read McSweeney's and

12:22.240 --> 12:25.140
want to be children's
librarians when they grow up.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.140
Oh yeah, jocks totally eat that shit up.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.140
They just won't admit
it, because they're

12:30.140 --> 12:31.640
supposed to be into perfect
cheerleaders you know,

12:32.440 --> 12:35.540
Like Leah, who incidentally
is into teachers.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.040
Me too, I love Woody Allen!

12:43.040 --> 12:43.840
Alright people.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.440
We're doing chromatography
lab today, so find

12:46.440 --> 12:48.640
your partners and break
into groups of four.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.240
Well, there's nothing
like experimenting.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.440
I did the prep questions
for this lab last night,

13:00.440 --> 13:02.240
so you can just copy
my answers if you want.

13:02.540 --> 13:03.440
I couldn't copy your work.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.440
You copy my work every week.

13:05.940 --> 13:07.940
True, I'm kind of a deadbeat
lab partner, aren't I?

13:08.340 --> 13:10.240
No, no, I don't mind. I think you
definitely bring something to the table.

13:10.740 --> 13:11.440
Charisma.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.940
Who's ready for some chromamagnificence?

13:16.640 --> 13:19.440
I have a menstrual migraine, so I can't
really look at bright lights today.

13:20.140 --> 13:23.340
Amanda, I told you to go to the
infirmary and lie down. You never listen.

13:23.840 --> 13:27.440
No, Josh, because I don't take orders.
Not from you and not from any man.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.440
You know, you've been
acting like this ever since

13:29.440 --> 13:30.840
I got back from visiting
my brother in Mankato.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.940
I already told you, nothing happened.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.840
Well, I'm gonna set up the apparatus.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.640
Juno, do you want to
plug in the Bunsen burner?

13:38.240 --> 13:39.040
It's my pleasure.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.040
I'm going to the infirmary.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.340
Good. Call me when you get off the rag.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.240
Fine, call me when you
learn how to love someone,

13:43.240 --> 13:44.840
instead of cheating at
your brother's college,

13:45.140 --> 13:47.040
Just because you've had
four Smirnoff Ices and

13:47.040 --> 13:48.840
a bottle of Snow Peak
Peach flavored Boone's!

13:49.140 --> 13:51.640
Good, Amanda, I'll be sure to
do that, I'll make a note of it.

13:54.440 --> 13:59.040
I've actually heard that the Snow Peak
Peach flavor is the best flavor of Boone's.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.440
Isn't that right, Bleek?

14:17.040 --> 14:19.140
Oprimo numero dos.

14:24.340 --> 14:28.440
Yeah, I'm just calling to
procure a hasty abortion.

14:29.640 --> 14:30.240
What?

14:32.240 --> 14:34.440
Can you just hold on for a
second, I'm on my hamburger phone.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.940
Okay, now I can,

14:41.740 --> 14:43.440
Yeah, it's really awkward to talk on.

14:45.540 --> 14:47.940
Yeah, I need an abortion.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.440
Sixteen.

14:51.740 --> 14:56.440
I'm gonna say it's been about two
months and four days since the sex,

14:57.240 --> 14:59.240
Mind you, that's just
like a guestimation.

15:02.540 --> 15:03.940
Sorry, how long have I been what?

15:04.640 --> 15:07.440
Oh, I hate it when adults use
the term "sexually active".

15:08.140 --> 15:09.240
What does it even mean?

15:09.640 --> 15:12.740
Can I deactivate someday, or is
this a permanent state of being?

15:13.340 --> 15:15.040
I guess Bleeker went
live that night we did it,

15:15.040 --> 15:16.740
I guess that's why he
got that look on his face.

15:18.440 --> 15:21.340
You should have seen this
octopus furnace at work.

15:21.340 --> 15:24.640
I had to get out my Hazmat
suit just to get into the thing.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.340
My dad used to be in the Army, but now
he's just your average HVAC specialist.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.240
He and my mom got
divorced when I was five,

15:31.640 --> 15:33.340
She lives on a Havasu
reservation in Arizona

15:33.340 --> 15:35.140
with her new husband and
three replacement kids.

15:35.740 --> 15:38.740
Oh, and she inexplicably mails
me a cactus every Valentine's Day.

15:39.140 --> 15:41.140
And I'm like, Thanks
a heap, Coyote Ugly.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.940
This cactus-gram stings even
worse than your abandonment.

15:45.340 --> 15:48.740
That's my stepmom, Bren, she's
completely obsessed with dogs.

15:49.540 --> 15:52.840
Owns a nail salon and always
smells like methylmethacrylate.

15:53.740 --> 15:55.940
So Juno, how was your
little maneuver last night?

15:56.940 --> 16:00.340
Which maneuver, sir? The one where I moved an
entire living room set from one lawn to the other,

16:01.040 --> 16:04.540
or the one where I downed a sixty-four
ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?

16:05.240 --> 16:07.740
Juno, did you by any
chance barf in my urn?

16:11.440 --> 16:13.940
Mac, you know that nice urn by the front
door, the one I got up in Stillwater?

16:14.840 --> 16:16.040
There was some blue shit,

16:16.440 --> 16:18.740
I mean, gunk, stuff
in there this morning.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.240
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda.

16:25.340 --> 16:26.540
I mean, maybe L.B. did it.

16:28.940 --> 16:32.740
Liberty Bell, if you put one more Baco on that
potato, I'm gonna kick your little monkey butt.

16:35.940 --> 16:40.040
All babies want to get borned!
All babies want to get borned!

16:41.040 --> 16:43.740
All babies want to get borned!

16:45.640 --> 16:46.640
Hey Su-Chin.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.540
Hi, Juno.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.140
How are you?

16:50.440 --> 16:51.740
You know, pretty solid.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.740
So did you write that
paper for Worth's class yet?

16:57.640 --> 16:58.540
No, not yet.

16:59.540 --> 17:02.740
I tried to work on it a little last night,
but I'm having trouble concentrating.

17:03.340 --> 17:04.840
I'll sell you some of my Adderall.

17:05.940 --> 17:07.240
No thanks, I'm off pills.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.840
That's a wise choice 'cause I knew
this girl, she had this crazy freakout.

17:11.740 --> 17:15.840
She took too many behavioral meds at
once and she ripped off her clothes

17:16.240 --> 17:22.240
and dove into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall
like, Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!

17:25.340 --> 17:26.140
I heard that was you.

17:28.340 --> 17:29.840
It was good seeing you, Su-Chin.

17:33.340 --> 17:35.440
Your baby probably has a
beating heart, you know?

17:36.340 --> 17:37.540
It can feel pain,

17:38.940 --> 17:40.140
And it has fingernails.

17:42.740 --> 17:44.440
Fingernails? Really?

18:01.540 --> 18:04.140
Welcome to Women Now, where
women are trusted friends.

18:04.540 --> 18:07.140
Please put your hands where I can
see them and surrender any bombs.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.040
Hey, I'm here for the big show.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.140
Your name, please?

18:13.540 --> 18:14.440
Juno MacGuff.

18:15.740 --> 18:18.840
She thinks I'm using a fake name.
Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.

18:22.140 --> 18:24.540
I need you to fill
these out, both sides.

18:24.540 --> 18:27.440
We need to know about
every score and every sore.

18:30.740 --> 18:31.840
Would you like a free condom?

18:32.640 --> 18:33.540
They're boysenberry.

18:34.340 --> 18:35.640
No, I'm off sex.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.140
My boyfriend uses them every
time we have intercourse.

18:40.940 --> 18:42.640
They make his jocks smell like pie.

19:17.340 --> 19:21.140
All babies want to get borned!
All babies want to get borned!

19:22.940 --> 19:24.540
God appreciates your miracle!

19:26.140 --> 19:27.840
Dude, what are you doing here?

19:28.140 --> 19:29.440
I'm supposed to come get you at four.

19:29.940 --> 19:30.640
I couldn't do it, Leah!

19:32.040 --> 19:34.040
It smelled like a
dentist office in there,

19:34.440 --> 19:36.140
And there were these horrible
magazines with water stains.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.840
And then the friggin'
receptionist is trying to

19:38.840 --> 19:41.240
give me these condoms that
looked like grape suckers,

19:41.840 --> 19:45.140
and just babbling away about her
friggin' boyfriend's pie balls.

19:45.540 --> 19:46.240
Yum!

19:46.540 --> 19:48.440
And Su-Chin was there, and she was

19:48.440 --> 19:50.740
like, "Oh hi! Babies have fingernails. "

19:51.140 --> 19:52.040
Fingernails!

19:52.540 --> 19:53.240
That's gruesome.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.940
You think the baby can scratch
your vag on the way out?

19:57.540 --> 19:58.840
I'm staying pregnant, Leah.

19:59.440 --> 20:02.340
Dude! You gotta keep your
voice down, my mom is inside.

20:02.340 --> 20:04.640
She doesn't know that
we're sexually active.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.040
What does that even mean?

20:07.140 --> 20:08.740
I've been thinking.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.640
I was thinking that I could have this baby
and give it to someone who totally needs it.

20:12.940 --> 20:15.440
You know, like a woman with a bum
ovary or a couple of nice lesbos.

20:15.940 --> 20:19.040
But then you're gonna get huge
and your chest is gonna milktate.

20:20.040 --> 20:25.240
- And you have to tell people that you're pregnant.
- But maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.

20:25.540 --> 20:31.340
Maybe they'll totally shit and be really mad and
not let you graduate or go to Cabo for spring break.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.340
I was going to go to
Gettysburg with Bleeker anyway.

20:36.540 --> 20:38.140
You should look at adoption ads,

20:38.440 --> 20:39.940
I see them all the
time in the Penny Saver.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.640
They have ads for parents?

20:43.340 --> 20:48.840
Yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn. " Right next to
terriers and iguanas and used fitness equipment.

20:51.240 --> 20:51.540
It's totally legit.

20:55.840 --> 20:59.540
"Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple
have found true love with each other. "

21:01.140 --> 21:02.540
"All that's missing is your bastard. "

21:03.440 --> 21:04.440
I want a parakeet.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.540
You're totally not even listening to me.

21:06.840 --> 21:11.740
No, I heard you. I don't want to give the baby to
a family that describes themselves as "wholesome. "

21:12.140 --> 21:14.240
- Why?
- I want something a little more edgier.

21:14.640 --> 21:19.140
- Okay, what did you have in mind exactly?
- I was thinking a graphic designer,

21:19.540 --> 21:24.140
mid-thirties, with a cool Asian girlfriend who
dresses awesome and rocks out on the bass guitar.

21:24.740 --> 21:26.240
But I don't want to be too particular.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.540
OK, how about this?

21:29.840 --> 21:33.940
"Educated, successful couple seeking
infant to join our family of five. "

21:34.240 --> 21:38.440
"You will be compensated. Help
us complete the circle of love. "

21:39.040 --> 21:40.140
That sounds great.

21:40.440 --> 21:45.240
They sound like a friggin' cult. Besides, they
already have three kids, they're greedy little bitches.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.340
Oh, Juno! How about this one?

21:51.640 --> 21:52.940
They were Mark and Vanessa Loring,

21:54.240 --> 21:56.240
And they were beautiful
even in black and white.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.540
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?

22:08.940 --> 22:10.040
No, I don't think so.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.340
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.940
I'm not hungry, oddly.

22:15.540 --> 22:17.240
But it's breakfast for supper.
It's your favorite, Paul.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.340
Yeah.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.640
Juno MacGuff called while
you were out running today.

22:24.340 --> 22:25.640
You know how I feel about her.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.740
You've mentioned it a couple times.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.340
She is just...

22:32.340 --> 22:33.240
...different.

22:34.940 --> 22:35.540
Yeah.

23:02.240 --> 23:04.340
I'm not really sure how
I'm gonna spit this out.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.040
Hon, did you get expelled?

23:06.540 --> 23:10.340
No. The school would most likely
contact you in the event of my expulsion.

23:10.940 --> 23:12.940
Well, I was just asking.
It seemed plausible.

23:13.540 --> 23:15.840
Do you need a large amount
of money? Legal counsel?

23:16.440 --> 23:18.240
No, I'm not asking for anything.

23:19.340 --> 23:22.940
Except for maybe mercy. Like, it would
be friggin' sweet if no one hit me.

23:23.340 --> 23:25.240
What have you done, Junebug?
Did you hit someone with the Previa?

23:25.740 --> 23:26.440
No.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.540
Dude, I think it's
best to just tell them.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.140
I'm pregnant.

23:38.740 --> 23:39.540
Oh, God.

23:40.340 --> 23:42.040
But I'm going to give
it up for adoption.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.640
I already found the perfect couple.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.140
They're gonna pay for the
medical expenses and everything.

23:47.640 --> 23:51.440
In thirty-odd weeks we can just
pretend that this never happened.

23:53.840 --> 23:54.740
You're pregnant?

23:55.240 --> 23:56.140
I'm sorry.

23:56.640 --> 24:00.140
I'm sorry. And if it is any consolation,

24:00.640 --> 24:02.140
I have heartburn that's
radiating down to my kneecaps

24:02.840 --> 24:05.740
and I haven't take a
dump since Wednesday.

24:07.040 --> 24:07.840
Morning!

24:08.340 --> 24:09.640
I didn't even know you
were sexually active!

24:11.140 --> 24:11.940
Who is the kid?

24:12.740 --> 24:16.440
The baby? I don't really know much
about it. It has fingernails, allegedly.

24:17.540 --> 24:18.340
Nails? Really?

24:18.740 --> 24:19.440
Yeah.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.640
I mean, who is the father, Juno?

24:25.440 --> 24:27.040
It's Paulie Bleeker.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.240
Paulie Bleeker?

24:31.140 --> 24:31.740
What?

24:32.840 --> 24:34.040
I didn't think he had it in him!

24:34.440 --> 24:35.440
I know, right?

24:36.740 --> 24:38.240
Right, this is no laughing matter.

24:38.640 --> 24:39.540
No, it's not.

24:40.140 --> 24:42.240
And Paulie is actually great.

24:43.540 --> 24:44.040
In chair.

24:46.140 --> 24:47.240
You were thinking about adoption?

24:47.940 --> 24:50.040
Yeah, there's this couple.

24:50.040 --> 24:54.240
They've been trying to
have a kid for five years.

24:54.540 --> 24:56.640
We found them in the Penny
Saver next to the exotic birds.

24:57.540 --> 25:01.640
They have a legitimate lawyer and I was
going to go meet with them next weekend.

25:02.140 --> 25:04.640
Junebug, that is a
tough, tough thing to do.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.440
Probably tougher than you
can understand right now.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.040
I know...

25:11.340 --> 25:14.140
...It's just that I'm
not ready to be a mom.

25:14.740 --> 25:15.740
Damn skippy, you're not!

25:16.640 --> 25:18.640
You don't even remember to give
Liberty Bell her breathing meds.

25:19.140 --> 25:22.340
That was once! And she
did not die, if you recall!

25:23.840 --> 25:27.240
Honey, had you considered,
you know, the alternative?

25:28.140 --> 25:29.040
No.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.440
Well, you're a little Viking!

25:33.840 --> 25:34.540
First things first,

25:35.040 --> 25:36.340
we have to get you healthy.

25:36.640 --> 25:37.540
You need prenatal vitamins,

25:38.340 --> 25:41.740
Incidentally, they do incredible
things for your nails, so that's a plus.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.140
Oh, and we need to schedule
a doctor's appointment.

25:44.140 --> 25:45.640
Figure out where
you're going to deliver.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.840
Juno, I'm coming with you
to meet this adoption people.

25:50.140 --> 25:53.340
You're just a kid. I don't want you to get
ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts.

25:54.340 --> 25:55.240
Thanks, Dad.

25:56.340 --> 25:58.440
I thought you were the kind of
girl who knew when to say when.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.040
I don't really know
what kind of girl I am.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.240
Tell it to me straight, Bren.
Do you think this is my fault?

26:24.040 --> 26:26.040
I think kids get bored
and have intercourse.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.440
And I think Junebug was
a dummy about it, Mac.

26:29.740 --> 26:30.940
I am not ready to be a Pop-Pop.

26:31.540 --> 26:32.540
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop.

26:33.340 --> 26:38.140
Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing
from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.740
Did you see that coming
when she sat us down here?

26:42.040 --> 26:44.640
Yeah. But I was hoping she was
expelled or into hard drugs.

26:45.040 --> 26:48.640
That was my first instinct too.
Or D.W.I. Anything but this.

26:50.940 --> 26:53.340
And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid
in the weiner the next time I see him.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.640
Mac, no. You know it wasn't his idea.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.640
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must
be Juno and Mr. MacGuff.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.540
Vanessa.

28:10.040 --> 28:10.940
It's Vanessa, right?

28:12.040 --> 28:14.840
Thanks for having me and my
irresponsible child over to your house.

28:15.540 --> 28:16.440
Oh no. Thank you.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.040
Come on in.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.740
Can I take your coat or your hat?

28:22.040 --> 28:23.140
Oh, yeah, sure, thanks.

28:23.940 --> 28:26.640
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver,
by the way. Super classy.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.340
Not like those people with
fake woods in the background,

28:29.640 --> 28:31.540
Honestly, who do they
think they're fooling?

28:32.440 --> 28:33.540
You found us in the Penny Saver?

28:33.840 --> 28:35.740
Hi. Mark Loring. I'm the husband.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.240
- How you doing? Mac McGuff.
- Nice to meet you.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.140
Hi.

28:40.340 --> 28:42.240
This is Gerta Rauss, our attorney.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.540
Gerta Rauss.

28:45.540 --> 28:46.640
Hi, pleased to meet you.

28:48.440 --> 28:49.940
And this, of course, is Juno.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.440
Like the city in Alaska.

28:52.840 --> 28:53.440
No.

28:54.240 --> 28:54.840
No?

28:55.440 --> 28:56.140
Hon?

28:56.640 --> 28:58.040
Shall we sit down and
get to know one another?

28:58.340 --> 28:59.540
I thought I'd get some drinks.

28:59.840 --> 29:03.940
What would anyone like? I have Pellegrino
or Vitamin Water or orange juice.

29:04.340 --> 29:06.440
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.

29:08.640 --> 29:09.340
She's kidding.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.440
Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor,
just one of her many genetic gifts.

29:13.740 --> 29:14.540
I see.

29:17.840 --> 29:21.140
So, Juno. First off,
how far along are you?

29:21.640 --> 29:22.340
I'm a junior.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.440
No, I mean in your pregnancy.

29:27.740 --> 29:32.240
Oh. Uh, actually my stepmom took me yesterday
to the doctor and they said I was twelve weeks.

29:32.840 --> 29:33.640
Oh, that's marvelous.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.740
So you're into your second trimester?

29:37.140 --> 29:39.640
Yeah, apparently.

29:40.340 --> 29:41.740
I'm due on May 4.

29:42.040 --> 29:42.740
Great.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.240
My girlfriends tell me the first
couple months are the hardest.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.040
I didn't notice it at all.

29:47.340 --> 29:53.640
I'm more concerned about when they have to
put that elastic band in the front of my jeans.

29:54.740 --> 29:56.140
I think pregnancy is beautiful.

29:56.940 --> 29:58.440
Well, you're lucky it's not you.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.740
So, let's talk how we're
gonna do this... thing.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.240
Well, don't I just have the thing?

30:07.540 --> 30:09.440
Squeeze it on out and hand it over?

30:10.440 --> 30:13.540
Mark and Vanessa are willing
to negotiate an open adoption.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.040
What does that mean?

30:15.440 --> 30:18.040
It means they'd send
annual updates, photos,

30:18.040 --> 30:21.540
let Juno know how the baby is
doing as he or she grows up.

30:21.840 --> 30:25.940
Whoah. I don't want photos
or any kind of notification.

30:27.340 --> 30:29.340
Can't we just kick this old school?

30:29.340 --> 30:32.340
I stick the baby in a
basket and send it your way.

30:32.340 --> 30:33.840
Like Moses in the reeds.

30:34.940 --> 30:36.740
Technically, that would be
kickin' it Old Testament.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.740
Exactly! Right?

30:40.040 --> 30:40.840
Do you know what I mean?

30:41.140 --> 30:43.240
Like in the good old days.
When it was quick and dirty.

30:45.040 --> 30:50.240
Well, then we all agree a traditional closed
adoption would be best for all involved?

30:50.840 --> 30:53.540
Shit, yes, just close her on up.

30:54.340 --> 30:56.740
Obviously, we would compensate
you for all your medical expenses.

30:57.740 --> 30:59.940
Are you looking for any
other type of compensation?

31:02.140 --> 31:02.940
Excuse me?

31:06.740 --> 31:07.440
No.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.140
No, I don't want to
sell the thing, I just...

31:11.240 --> 31:12.140
...I want...

31:14.340 --> 31:18.140
...I just want the baby to be
with people who are gonna love it,

31:19.040 --> 31:20.840
And be good parents, you know?

31:22.740 --> 31:24.340
I'm in high school.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.940
I'm ill-equipped.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.240
You're doing a beautiful
and a selfless thing for us.

31:33.740 --> 31:35.940
Vanessa has wanted a baby
ever since we got married.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.440
I want to be a mommy so badly!

31:38.940 --> 31:39.840
You don't say.

31:40.140 --> 31:42.540
Have you ever felt like you
were just born to do something?

31:43.140 --> 31:44.140
Yes.

31:44.540 --> 31:45.540
Heating and air conditioning.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.140
There you go.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.340
I was born to be a mother.

31:49.940 --> 31:50.840
Some of us are.

31:51.640 --> 31:55.440
How about you, Mark, are you
looking forward to being a dad?

31:56.640 --> 31:57.440
Betcha, yeah.

31:58.840 --> 32:02.340
Every guy wants to be a father.
Wants to coach the soccer team and

32:02.640 --> 32:06.340
help out with the science
fair and the volcano goes off.

32:07.540 --> 32:08.540
Yeah, all that.

32:09.940 --> 32:13.940
Maybe Gerta could take us through the
preliminary documents that you have drawn up.

32:14.440 --> 32:20.540
Could I use the facilities first? Being
pregnant makes me pee like Seabiscuit.

32:21.340 --> 32:26.740
The downstairs bathroom is being re-tiled,
but if you go upstairs, then to the right...

32:26.940 --> 32:28.440
Oh yeah! Room with the toilet.

32:29.940 --> 32:30.740
Is she alright?

33:18.640 --> 33:19.340
Sorry.

33:19.840 --> 33:20.840
Sorry, I didn't expect
to see you up here.

33:21.340 --> 33:22.340
I just came up to get something.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.940
Did your wife send you
up here to spy on me?

33:25.540 --> 33:26.340
No.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.940
Do we come off as paranoid
yuppies or something?

33:32.440 --> 33:34.040
I stole a squirt of your wife's perfume.

33:34.640 --> 33:35.240
Really?

33:35.940 --> 33:37.240
It's Clinique Happy.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.440
Get a whiff of those sparkling topnotes!

33:40.040 --> 33:42.440
Is that supposed to make me feel happy?

33:43.240 --> 33:44.340
You should feel happy, Holmes.

33:45.140 --> 33:49.140
I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life.
Sweet, screaming, pooping life!

33:49.440 --> 33:51.440
And you don't even have to be there
when it comes out all covered in...

33:51.940 --> 33:52.740
Viscera?

33:53.040 --> 33:54.040
Blood and guts.

33:58.540 --> 33:59.640
Is that a Les Paul?

34:01.140 --> 34:02.040
Yes, it is.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.240
Vanessa gave me my own
room for all my stuff.

34:05.640 --> 34:09.540
She gave you your own room in
your whole house for your stuff?

34:11.040 --> 34:12.540
She's got you on a
long leash there, Mark.

34:14.140 --> 34:15.040
Oh, it's beautiful.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.340
You know? I always loved
Gibson way more than Fender.

34:19.640 --> 34:20.640
What do you play?

34:21.140 --> 34:22.440
I rock a Harmony.

34:26.840 --> 34:27.640
So is it mahagony?

34:27.940 --> 34:31.140
What happens if you crack the neck?

34:31.440 --> 34:32.840
Tell me about it. I used
to play in this really tight

34:32.840 --> 34:34.440
band when I lived in Chicago
and one night we opened up

34:34.940 --> 34:36.740
for the Melvins and I
busted that thing right on

34:36.740 --> 34:38.640
stage and it cost me
$800 just to get it fixed.

34:40.540 --> 34:42.040
When was that?

34:42.340 --> 34:44.040
‘93. Best time for rock and roll.

34:45.640 --> 34:49.940
Nuh-uh, '77! Punk Volume #1.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.340
You're crazy.

34:51.740 --> 34:52.740
You weren't there,

34:52.940 --> 34:54.340
You couldn't understand the magic.

34:54.640 --> 34:55.840
You weren't even alive!

34:58.240 --> 34:58.940
What's that?

35:02.540 --> 35:03.540
It's a Pilates machine.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.040
What do you make with it?

35:08.440 --> 35:10.740
You don't make anything.
It's for exercising.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.140
My wife ordered one of those

35:15.140 --> 35:16.940
Tony Little Gazelles off the TV.

35:17.540 --> 35:18.840
You know, from the
guy with the ponytail?

35:20.140 --> 35:21.540
That guy just doesn't look right to me.

35:30.640 --> 35:31.840
I'll be right back.

35:34.540 --> 35:35.340
Excuse me.

35:44.640 --> 35:45.240
Hi.

35:46.140 --> 35:46.640
Hi.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.040
You're playing music?

35:48.640 --> 35:50.340
Juno wanted a little
closer look at Kimber.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.540
Your guitar is named Kimber?

35:53.140 --> 35:53.540
Yeah.

35:53.940 --> 35:55.940
That's cool. My axe is named Roosevelt.

35:55.940 --> 35:59.040
After Franklin, not Ted. He
was the hot one with polio.

36:01.540 --> 36:03.740
Gerta is downstairs, we still have

36:04.440 --> 36:05.640
a lot of stuff to go over.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.140
I got it.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.740
Not to interrupt the jam session.

36:14.840 --> 36:18.140
So, just look these over and if you
have any questions, call me at my office.

36:18.740 --> 36:23.540
We would really appreciate it if you would just
keep us updated on any doctor's appointments,

36:23.840 --> 36:25.540
Ultrasounds, anything of that nature.

36:25.840 --> 36:29.740
For sure. You want to know how
your kid is cooking, I get it.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.540
You think you're really
going to do this, then?

36:34.140 --> 36:36.740
Yeah. I like you guys.

36:39.040 --> 36:40.540
How sure would you say you are?

36:43.340 --> 36:45.840
Would you say you're 80% sure, 90% sure?

36:48.340 --> 36:50.140
I'm going to say I'm about 104% sure.

36:50.840 --> 36:51.740
Really?

36:52.940 --> 36:57.240
Seriously, if I could just have the thing
and give it to you now, I totally would,

36:57.640 --> 37:00.740
But I'm guessing it looks probably
like a Sea Monkey right now,

37:01.240 --> 37:04.440
And we should let it get
a little cuter, right?

37:04.940 --> 37:05.840
- Yeah.
- Great.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.240
Keep it in the oven.

37:07.540 --> 37:08.440
I think that's a great idea.

37:08.840 --> 37:09.640
Nice to meet you both.

37:09.940 --> 37:12.640
Please, drive carefully.
Hopefully we'll hear from you soon.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.940
- Take care.
- Buh bye.

37:51.740 --> 37:52.340
Hey, man.

37:52.740 --> 37:54.140
Hey, Vijay.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.840
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?

37:56.540 --> 37:57.340
Yeah.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.940
- Like our moms and teachers!
- Yeah.

38:00.440 --> 38:01.240
Did you hear it's yours?

38:03.340 --> 38:04.140
Yup.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.140
What a trip, man.

38:06.440 --> 38:08.240
I don't really know too much about it.

38:09.140 --> 38:10.340
You should grow a moustache.

38:11.340 --> 38:12.140
I can't.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.340
Me neither.

38:13.540 --> 38:15.040
But I'm going to stop
wearing underpants.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.540
Raise my sperm count.

38:44.140 --> 38:44.940
Juno, hey.

38:45.140 --> 38:45.840
Hey, Bleek.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.740
Me and some guys are gonna go to the movies
after school and we're gonna donut that flick

38:49.240 --> 38:51.440
with the guy who has eighteen kids.

38:51.840 --> 38:52.940
Do you want to come?

38:54.640 --> 38:56.240
Sounds awesome, but I got my ultrasound.

38:57.140 --> 38:58.140
Oh, really?

38:59.640 --> 39:00.440
Can I...

39:02.140 --> 39:03.140
...Should I come?

39:05.940 --> 39:07.240
Oh, you can't waste those donut balls,

39:07.640 --> 39:11.340
But maybe I could drop by later.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.240
Okay, cool.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.140
- Later, Bleek.
- See ya.

39:17.840 --> 39:18.640
I'll save you a seat.

39:30.540 --> 39:31.540
There's your baby.

39:32.340 --> 39:33.540
Oh, my God.

39:36.140 --> 39:36.940
There's a hand.

39:39.740 --> 39:40.640
And an arm.

39:44.140 --> 39:45.440
And there's the feet.

39:49.040 --> 39:49.940
Would you look at that?

39:51.940 --> 39:55.140
Check out Baby Big-Head. Dude,
that thing is freaky looking!

39:56.040 --> 39:58.540
Excuse me, I am a sacred vessel.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.740
All you've got in your
stomach is Taco Bell!

40:02.340 --> 40:04.640
It's amazing that there's
actually saps that cry at this.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.740
What? I'm not made of stone.

40:09.340 --> 40:10.440
Well, there you have it.

40:11.640 --> 40:12.540
Would you like to know the sex?

40:12.940 --> 40:13.740
- Yes.
- No.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.740
- Please, Junebug?
- No sex.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.340
Planning to be surprised
when you deliver?

40:18.740 --> 40:23.040
I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and
if you told me, I'll just ruin everything.

40:23.540 --> 40:25.340
Are Mark and Vanessa
your friends at school?

40:25.740 --> 40:26.840
No, they're the adoptive parents.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.540
Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.

40:31.140 --> 40:32.040
What's that supposed to mean?

40:33.440 --> 40:35.640
I just see a lot of teenage
mothers come through here.

40:36.540 --> 40:38.940
It's obviously a poisonous
environment to raise a baby in.

40:39.340 --> 40:40.940
How do you know that I'm so poisonous?

40:41.340 --> 40:44.540
What if these adoptive parents
turn out to be evil molesters?

40:44.740 --> 40:46.740
Or like stage parents.

40:46.940 --> 40:49.340
They could be utterly negligent.
Maybe they'll do a far shittier job

40:49.740 --> 40:51.640
of raising a kid than my
dumbass stepdaughter ever would.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.440
Have you considered that?

40:53.840 --> 40:54.840
No, I guess not.

40:56.340 --> 40:57.540
What is your job title, exactly?

40:58.640 --> 41:01.440
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

41:02.040 --> 41:05.440
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think
we both ought to stick to what we know.

41:05.940 --> 41:06.740
Excuse me?

41:07.540 --> 41:11.940
You think you're so special because
you get to play Picture Pages up there?

41:12.140 --> 41:14.240
My five year-old daughter could do that, and let me tell
you, she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.540
So why don't you go back to night
school in Manteno and learn a real trade!

41:23.540 --> 41:24.940
Bren, you's a dick!

41:26.540 --> 41:27.440
I love it.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.640
Juno? Wow, I didn't
expect to see you here.

42:33.240 --> 42:36.040
I have something really cool to
show you guys. Is Vanessa here?

42:37.440 --> 42:39.540
No, actually she's working late tonight.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.440
She's trying to accrue as much
time off as she can before...

42:43.140 --> 42:44.540
Oh right. I hear these
are quite the time-suck.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.040
Wanna come in? I was just
having a Ginseng Cooler.

42:48.540 --> 42:49.640
Would you like one?

42:49.940 --> 42:52.940
What is it with you rich people
and your herb-infused juices?

42:54.640 --> 42:56.040
It's probably got something to do with
those forty four-packs they come in.

42:57.640 --> 42:58.840
They're not bad, though.

42:59.240 --> 43:01.040
Why aren't you at work?

43:01.940 --> 43:03.640
I work mostly from home. I'm a composer.

43:05.340 --> 43:06.240
No shit.

43:06.940 --> 43:08.240
Like Johannes Brahms?

43:08.540 --> 43:10.340
No, more commercial stuff.

43:11.140 --> 43:11.940
Like what?

43:12.340 --> 43:13.440
Commercials.

43:14.840 --> 43:17.040
Have you seen the ads for the
Titanium Power men's deodorant?

43:28.540 --> 43:29.540
Paid for this kitchen.

43:32.340 --> 43:33.340
You're quite the sellout, Mark.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.740
What would the Melvins say?

43:38.340 --> 43:39.640
Did you say you had
something to show me.

43:40.540 --> 43:43.140
Behold, good sir! Your future child.

43:45.140 --> 43:46.040
Hey, look at that.

43:49.940 --> 43:51.640
I think it looks like my friend Paulie.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.040
Is he also bald and amorphous?

43:55.440 --> 43:56.440
No, he's the dad.

43:59.940 --> 44:00.940
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?

44:02.440 --> 44:05.840
I can't, the doctor can. But I
kind of want it to be a surprise.

44:07.340 --> 44:09.440
Well, it can only go one of two ways.

44:10.140 --> 44:11.140
That's what you think.

44:11.140 --> 44:16.140
I drink tons of booze so you might end up with one
of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.

44:16.940 --> 44:17.740
Junk, huh?

44:18.840 --> 44:19.840
You know, it's parts.

44:20.140 --> 44:21.140
I know what junk is.

44:21.640 --> 44:22.140
Yeah, right.

44:22.440 --> 44:23.440
We definitely want it to
have some junk, please.

44:24.340 --> 44:25.540
Well, you don't need
to worry about a thing.

44:26.240 --> 44:29.540
My stepmom, Bren, makes
me eat super healthy.

44:30.240 --> 44:32.440
I can't stand in front of
the microwave and no red M&Ms.

44:33.240 --> 44:35.240
I hope you're ready.

44:37.340 --> 44:38.740
Ooh... do you hear that?

44:39.940 --> 44:40.640
What?

44:40.840 --> 44:45.040
This is my favorite song. It's Sonic
Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.140
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know the Carpenters.

44:47.940 --> 44:50.840
Chick drummer, freaky dude.
Not unlike the White Stripes.

44:51.240 --> 44:53.540
You haven't heard the Carpenters
like this. Just listen.

45:02.640 --> 45:05.140
Yeah, I like this.

45:06.340 --> 45:07.540
What did you say your favorite band was?

45:07.840 --> 45:13.140
Didn't. It's a three-way tie between the
Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.

45:13.340 --> 45:15.940
I definitely need to make you some
CDs. At least while my kid's in there.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.640
The Wizard of Gore?

45:23.340 --> 45:25.940
That is Herschel Gordon Lewis.
He's the ultimate master of horror.

45:26.540 --> 45:30.940
Please. Dario Argento is so
the ultimate master of horror.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.240
Argento?

45:33.740 --> 45:36.840
He's alright, but Lewis
is completely dimented.

45:37.440 --> 45:39.240
We're talking buckets of goo.

45:39.240 --> 45:43.840
Red corn syrup all over the place.
Fake brains coming out the yin-yang.

45:44.540 --> 45:46.940
Quite frankly, this
looks a little stupid.

45:49.140 --> 45:49.840
Give me the tape.

46:04.840 --> 46:06.940
This is even better than Suspiria.

46:07.540 --> 46:08.240
What'd I tell ya?

46:08.540 --> 46:12.140
You have decent taste in slasher movies.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.340
Here's to dovetailing interests.

46:18.240 --> 46:19.640
Have you guys thought of
any names for the baby yet?

46:21.640 --> 46:24.840
Sort of, yes. Vanessa
likes Madison for a girl.

46:28.540 --> 46:30.240
Madison?

46:32.140 --> 46:35.240
Isn't that a little, gay?

46:38.240 --> 46:41.140
Well, pretentious much? Should everyone
just have a mysterious name like Juno?

46:44.240 --> 46:48.040
My dad went through this huge obsession
with Roman and Greek mythology.

46:48.440 --> 46:51.440
He decided to name me after Zeus's wife,

46:52.040 --> 46:56.540
Zeus had tons of lays, but I'm
pretty sure Juno was his only wife.

46:58.040 --> 47:01.740
She was supposed to be really beautiful
but really mean. Like Diana Ross.

47:03.540 --> 47:04.540
That suits you.

47:06.440 --> 47:07.440
Thanks?

47:10.940 --> 47:12.140
You're something else.

47:17.940 --> 47:19.440
Vanessa. You'd better go.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.840
She hates when I sit around watching
movies and I don't contribute.

47:25.640 --> 47:28.940
I'll handle this. I'm really
good at diffusing mom-type rage.

47:29.240 --> 47:29.940
No, Juno, no.

47:32.840 --> 47:34.140
Juno, what's going on?

47:34.540 --> 47:35.840
- Nothing.
- What are you doing here? What's wrong?

47:36.040 --> 47:37.240
Nothing, I went to the doctor today.

47:37.540 --> 47:38.440
Is there something wrong with the baby?

47:38.740 --> 47:39.340
The baby is great.

47:39.340 --> 47:41.640
It's the right size and everything.
I even saw its phalanges today!

47:42.340 --> 47:43.540
Here.

47:45.240 --> 47:45.840
It's the baby.

47:46.940 --> 47:47.540
It's your baby.

47:51.840 --> 47:54.240
It kinda looks like it's waving.

47:55.540 --> 47:58.540
Like it's saying "Hey,
Vanessa. Will you be my mom?"

47:59.540 --> 48:00.840
Yeah, it kind of does.

48:01.840 --> 48:04.040
Juno was nice enough to
bring that over for us today.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.040
I came as soon as I got that
ultrasound goo off my pelvis.

48:07.540 --> 48:09.640
It was crazy actually,

48:10.140 --> 48:14.440
My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound
tech so we got escorted off the premises.

48:19.940 --> 48:21.540
Wow, what kind of swag did you score?

48:22.640 --> 48:23.540
Mall madness, huh?

48:23.740 --> 48:25.340
It's just some stuff I
picked up for the baby.

48:26.340 --> 48:28.540
Don't you usually get all
that stuff at a baby shower?

48:29.140 --> 48:32.640
When my stepmom was pregnant with my
little sister she got a million gifts.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.540
But I wasn't jealous 'cause
they all were super lame.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.540
I doubt anyone's gonna
throw us a shower.

48:38.340 --> 48:39.740
Why wouldn't they
throw you a baby shower?

48:40.140 --> 48:45.640
I don't think people know how to feel about
this situation because it's not set in stone.

48:47.040 --> 48:47.840
What isn't set...

48:50.540 --> 48:52.740
You don't think I'm
going to flake out on you?

48:53.340 --> 48:54.240
No, I don't, Juno.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.240
We went through a situation before

48:58.040 --> 48:58.940
where it didn't work out.

48:59.140 --> 49:00.240
Cold feet.

49:05.840 --> 49:06.840
You should have gone to China.

49:08.640 --> 49:11.040
I hear they give away
babies like free iPods.

49:12.640 --> 49:14.040
They put ‘em in those T-shirt guns

49:15.140 --> 49:16.240
and shoot them out at sporting events.

49:19.240 --> 49:21.640
Your parents are probably
wondering where you are.

49:21.940 --> 49:23.640
Naah. I'm already pregnant,

49:24.140 --> 49:26.240
so what other kind of
shenanigans could I get into?

49:27.740 --> 49:29.140
I should probably bounce.

49:29.640 --> 49:30.640
Hey, don't forget your bag.

49:31.240 --> 49:32.140
Ah, bag!

49:37.640 --> 49:38.640
Okay, take care.

50:01.540 --> 50:02.440
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?

50:03.840 --> 50:06.640
I just drove to St. Cloud to show
Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.

50:06.640 --> 50:08.340
I ended up staying
for a couple of hours.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.440
A couple of hours? Why are you
going over there in the first place?

50:12.440 --> 50:16.840
They wanted to know about this stuff.
I said I'd keep them updated, so I did!

50:17.240 --> 50:18.840
You could have mailed it to them.

50:19.140 --> 50:21.740
Why would you drive an hour
out to East Jesus, Nowhere?

50:23.840 --> 50:26.040
I don't know, I just did.

50:26.540 --> 50:28.340
And while Mark and I
were waiting for Vanessa,

50:28.340 --> 50:29.540
we watched The Wizard of Gore,

50:31.140 --> 50:33.840
And he burned me a couple
of CDs of this weird music.

50:34.840 --> 50:35.840
He's kind of cool.

50:38.340 --> 50:41.640
Juno, you can't just
drop in on them like that.

50:42.740 --> 50:46.440
No, it was not a big deal.
He was totally cool with it.

50:46.840 --> 50:47.740
You don't understand.

50:48.040 --> 50:50.040
Mark is a married man,
there are boundaries.

50:51.140 --> 50:52.140
Oh, come on.

50:52.440 --> 50:53.340
Listen,

50:53.640 --> 50:54.640
Bren-duhhh.

50:55.640 --> 50:58.740
You're acting like you're the
one who has to go through this

50:58.740 --> 51:01.940
and get huge and shove a baby
out of your vag for someone else.

51:03.740 --> 51:05.240
What does it even
matter if he's married?

51:05.240 --> 51:06.640
I can have friends that are married.

51:07.040 --> 51:08.340
It doesn't work that way, kiddo.

51:08.340 --> 51:10.640
You don't know squat about
the dynamics of marriage.

51:10.940 --> 51:12.040
You don't know anything about me!

51:12.440 --> 51:13.240
I know enough.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.140
We don't even have a dog!

51:17.640 --> 51:20.240
Yeah, because you're
allergic to their saliva.

51:21.540 --> 51:25.040
I have sacrificed a lot for you, Juno.
But in a couple years when you move out

51:25.640 --> 51:27.140
I'm going to get Weimaraners.

51:27.840 --> 51:28.740
Wow, dream big!

51:29.040 --> 51:30.440
Oh, go fly a kite.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.040
Hi, Juno.

51:57.040 --> 51:57.840
What can I do for you?

51:59.740 --> 52:00.740
Bleeker home?

52:01.340 --> 52:03.440
Bleeker's mom was
possibly attractive once.

52:03.940 --> 52:05.140
But now she looks a hobbit.

52:07.740 --> 52:09.140
You know, the fat one
that was in The Goonies.

52:17.240 --> 52:18.040
Hey, man,

52:18.740 --> 52:20.740
Don't concentrate so hard.
I think I can smell your hair all burning.

52:22.140 --> 52:22.840
Hey, what's up?

52:23.140 --> 52:26.140
Not much, I just wanted to come say hey.

52:26.140 --> 52:29.840
I miss hanging out with
you on school nights.

52:32.040 --> 52:34.440
Orange Tic-Tacs are
Bleeker's one and only vice.

52:35.540 --> 52:38.840
The day I got pregnant, his mouth
tasted really tangy and delicious.

52:49.040 --> 52:50.240
You seem to be getting...

52:50.840 --> 52:52.040
...pregnant-er these days.

52:55.340 --> 52:57.740
Ya know, I set up this
whole private adoption...

52:58.340 --> 53:03.040
...and this married couple in Saint
Cloud are going to be the parents.

53:03.740 --> 53:04.240
Really?

53:05.440 --> 53:06.640
What are they like?

53:07.040 --> 53:09.640
The guy, he's awesome.

53:10.540 --> 53:11.640
His name is Mark and

53:12.440 --> 53:14.940
he likes old horror movies
and he plays the guitar.

53:15.740 --> 53:17.040
We actually hung out this afternoon.

53:17.940 --> 53:18.940
Is that normal?

53:19.840 --> 53:21.040
Probably not, but...

53:21.940 --> 53:25.940
I talked to dad and Bren and they said
they wouldn't narc you out to your folks,

53:27.040 --> 53:27.940
So,

53:28.640 --> 53:30.140
I think we should be cool.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.040
That's a relief.

53:38.340 --> 53:39.840
I'm gonna start looking

53:40.340 --> 53:41.540
like a pretty big dork soon.

53:43.240 --> 53:45.740
Will you still think
I'm cute when I'm huge?

53:47.040 --> 53:48.540
I always think you're cute.

53:49.540 --> 53:50.540
I think you're beautiful.

53:51.340 --> 53:52.140
Jeez, Bleek.

53:53.440 --> 53:54.440
I do.

53:57.940 --> 54:01.140
Hey Junebug, when this is all over
we should get the band back together.

54:01.940 --> 54:03.440
Yeah.

54:04.540 --> 54:05.540
That would be awesome.

54:05.940 --> 54:07.740
Once Tino gets a new drumhead

54:08.040 --> 54:09.940
we're just, like, ready to rock.

54:11.440 --> 54:13.640
We could always get back together too.

54:14.540 --> 54:15.540
That's an option.

54:20.140 --> 54:21.740
Were we together?

54:22.440 --> 54:23.540
Yeah, we were once.

54:25.740 --> 54:26.840
That time.

54:33.640 --> 54:34.640
What about Katrina De Voort?

54:35.440 --> 54:37.340
You could totally go out
with Katrina De Voort.

54:37.640 --> 54:39.540
I don't like Katrina.

54:40.340 --> 54:41.240
She smells like soup.

54:41.740 --> 54:42.940
Her whole house smells of soup.

54:52.540 --> 54:53.340
Okay.

54:55.140 --> 54:58.140
So we have Custard, Cheesecake.

54:59.240 --> 55:00.240
They're yellow.

55:02.240 --> 55:04.340
I wanted to pick something
that was gender-neutral until

55:04.340 --> 55:06.540
we get the baby and then we
can add a more decisive palette.

55:08.440 --> 55:11.640
Why does everyone think
yellow is gender-neutral?

55:11.940 --> 55:13.040
I don't know any guy
with a yellow bedroom.

55:16.040 --> 55:18.240
I'm thinking more
Custard with this light.

55:19.840 --> 55:22.440
I don't know. Maybe I should
paint a larger swatch...

55:26.740 --> 55:27.940
Or you could wait a few more months.

55:29.240 --> 55:32.440
It's not like the baby's going to storm
in here demanding dessert-colored walls.

55:37.840 --> 55:43.740
"What to Expect" says that readying the baby's
room is an important process for the woman.

55:44.240 --> 55:46.340
Especially if you're adopting.
It's called "nesting. "

55:47.640 --> 55:48.640
Nesting?

55:50.540 --> 55:52.640
Are you going to build the
crib out of sticks and spit?

55:55.840 --> 56:00.140
You should read the book. I flagged
the "daddy chapters" for you.

56:00.440 --> 56:01.840
I think it's too early to paint.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.340
That's my opinion.

56:04.740 --> 56:05.740
I disagree.

56:09.940 --> 56:11.340
This wall is going to need something.

56:15.140 --> 56:16.840
Our first family photo
right in the middle.

56:18.040 --> 56:19.040
Right up there.

56:22.640 --> 56:23.640
Can you see it?

56:27.840 --> 56:30.140
Yum! This pretzel tastes
like a friggin' donut!

56:30.640 --> 56:31.640
Share the love, sweetness!

56:32.040 --> 56:32.840
You can't have any.

56:34.840 --> 56:35.840
She's assaulting me!

56:36.840 --> 56:38.040
She's denying me fresh-baked goodness!

56:39.140 --> 56:40.040
Oh, my God.

56:41.940 --> 56:43.240
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.

56:44.640 --> 56:46.040
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?

56:49.840 --> 56:51.540
Dude, she's, like, really pretty.

56:51.840 --> 56:53.640
You sound totally shocked or something.

56:55.540 --> 56:57.940
She's totally gonna steal
that kid for her collection.

56:58.440 --> 56:59.540
Right, seriously.

57:09.240 --> 57:10.340
Boring!

57:20.540 --> 57:25.140
I could so go for a huge cookie right now with like,
a lamb kebab, simultaneously.

57:26.140 --> 57:28.740
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

57:29.340 --> 57:32.240
It's like, never-ending for you.

57:33.540 --> 57:34.440
Juno!

57:34.740 --> 57:35.540
Hi, Vanessa!

57:35.940 --> 57:37.940
What brings you to the mall today?

57:38.440 --> 57:40.640
I was just shopping with my girlfriends.

57:41.340 --> 57:42.540
You're gay?

57:42.840 --> 57:43.540
No.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.140
Just ignore her.

57:45.540 --> 57:46.840
Well, how are you feeling?

57:47.040 --> 57:48.940
Great! Everything's stupendous.

57:49.240 --> 57:52.140
Oh, coming in on that snooze button.

57:54.640 --> 57:55.540
That's incredible.

57:56.740 --> 57:57.740
Oh, God.

57:59.040 --> 57:59.840
What?

58:00.040 --> 58:01.440
Kicking away.

58:04.540 --> 58:06.540
Could I feel it?

58:07.640 --> 58:08.740
Are you kidding?

58:11.040 --> 58:14.340
At school everyone's just
grabbing my belly all the time.

58:14.840 --> 58:17.040
I'm a legend.
They call me the Cautionary Whale.

58:21.640 --> 58:22.740
I can't feel anything.

58:26.140 --> 58:27.140
It's not moving for me.

58:29.740 --> 58:31.040
You should try talking to it.

58:31.040 --> 58:34.740
They can hear you, even though it's
all ten thousand leagues under the sea.

58:50.340 --> 58:51.340
Hi, baby.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.740
It's me. It's Vanessa.

59:03.740 --> 59:05.640
I can't wait to meet you.

59:13.040 --> 59:14.940
Can you hear me, baby?

59:16.440 --> 59:17.640
Sweet angel?

59:28.640 --> 59:30.140
I felt it!

59:32.540 --> 59:33.640
That was magical.

59:39.140 --> 59:40.140
Thank you.

59:40.640 --> 59:41.640
Thank you.

1:00:34.140 --> 1:00:34.840
Hello?

1:00:35.340 --> 1:00:36.140
Hey!

1:00:36.340 --> 1:00:40.140
So, I've been listening to that
really weird CD that you made me.

1:00:40.540 --> 1:00:41.540
Yeah? What's the verdict?

1:00:42.040 --> 1:00:43.240
Well, it's cute.

1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:44.940
It's cute?

1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:48.040
When you're used to listening to the
raw power of Iggy and the Stooges,

1:00:48.540 --> 1:00:51.440
everything else just sounds
kind of precious in comparison.

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:55.140
I imagine you have a collection of
punk chestnuts to prove your point.

1:00:55.940 --> 1:00:56.740
Well...

1:00:57.340 --> 1:00:58.840
...consider it your musical education.

1:00:59.940 --> 1:01:01.240
I can't wait to see what
you've got to teach me.

1:01:02.140 --> 1:01:03.940
Stop surfing porn and get back to work.

1:01:05.340 --> 1:01:06.940
Just wanted to call and say hi.

1:01:07.940 --> 1:01:09.340
Go learn something.

1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:15.440
- Oh, a little trip down Mexico way.
- And Greece and China apparently.

1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:17.640
How many months has it been now?

1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:19.040
You're getting huge.

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:22.740
It's homing in on the eight. You
should see how weird I look naked.

1:01:23.740 --> 1:01:25.240
I wish my funbags would get bigger.

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:28.540
Trust me, you don't. I have to
actually wear a friggin' bra now

1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:34.640
and rub all this nasty cocoa butter
stuff on myself so my skin won't explode.

1:01:35.140 --> 1:01:35.940
Hot!

1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:40.540
Why is everyone always staring at me?

1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:42.840
Well, you are kind of convex, you know?

1:01:44.740 --> 1:01:47.740
Whoah! Who's been doing their
geometry homework for once!

1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:51.240
I have no choice. Keith has
been grading me so hard lately.

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:53.840
Do not call Mr. Conyers "Keith".

1:01:54.140 --> 1:01:56.440
'Cause my barf reflex is
really enheightened these days.

1:01:57.140 --> 1:01:58.140
But Keith's hot.

1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:02.940
Eww, he's all beardy!

1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:07.140
Did you hear that Bleek is going
to the prom with Katrina De Voort?

1:02:09.540 --> 1:02:10.440
Katrina?

1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:13.040
No way, he doesn't like Katrina.

1:02:13.340 --> 1:02:14.740
Must be like a pity date or something.

1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:17.440
I heard he asked her and
that they're going to Benihana,

1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:19.440
and then prom, and then
Vijay's parents' cabin.

1:02:20.840 --> 1:02:23.040
He told me that Katrina's
house smells like soup!

1:02:23.340 --> 1:02:24.840
Oh my God, it totally does.

1:02:25.140 --> 1:02:28.640
I was there four years ago for her birthday
party and it was like Lipton Landing.

1:02:29.740 --> 1:02:32.040
But you know, boys have endured
way worse things for nookie.

1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:34.640
Oh, please.

1:02:34.940 --> 1:02:36.940
There is no way that they're having sex,

1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:38.640
They wouldn't even be holding hands.

1:02:38.940 --> 1:02:40.540
I wouldn't be so sure,
he did it with you.

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:42.740
Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me.

1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:44.440
We're best friends.

1:02:44.840 --> 1:02:46.040
Are you jealous?

1:02:46.540 --> 1:02:49.540
I thought you said you
didn't care what he did.

1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:50.840
Not jealous, don't care.

1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:53.140
I know Bleek doesn't like
Katrina and he shouldn't

1:02:53.140 --> 1:02:55.340
toy with her emotions like
that. She seems pretty nice.

1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:58.040
Uh-huh, I'm really convinced.

1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:00.040
Prom is for wenises, anyway.

1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:02.340
As soon as you're old enough
to go, it's so not cool anymore.

1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:15.040
Are you honestly and truly going
to the prom with Katrina De Voort?

1:03:16.740 --> 1:03:17.640
Uh, hi?

1:03:17.940 --> 1:03:20.040
Leah just said that you
were gonna go with her.

1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:22.440
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go.

1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:25.740
A bunch of us from the
team are going to Benihana,

1:03:25.740 --> 1:03:28.240
then go the prom, then go
to Vijay's parents' cabin.

1:03:31.540 --> 1:03:33.440
We're getting a stretch limo.

1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:36.340
Your mom must be pretty stoked
that you're not taking me.

1:03:38.540 --> 1:03:39.440
You're mad. Why are you mad?

1:03:40.940 --> 1:03:42.640
I'm not mad. I'm in a great mood.

1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:45.440
Despite the fact that I'm in
a fat suit I can't take off,

1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:47.740
despite the fact that pretty
much everyone is making

1:03:48.340 --> 1:03:50.840
fun of me behind my back,
despite the fact that your

1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:53.540
girlfriend gave me the
stinkeye in art class yesterday.

1:03:54.440 --> 1:03:57.440
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I
doubt that she gave you the stinkeye.

1:03:58.740 --> 1:03:59.840
That's just the way her face looks.

1:04:03.540 --> 1:04:08.640
Just take Soupy Sales to prom, I can think
of so many cooler things to do that night.

1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:12.640
I might pumice my feet or go
to Bren's Unitarian church,

1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:16.040
maybe get hit by a truck
full of hot garbage juice.

1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:20.040
All those things would be exponentially
cooler than going to the prom with you.

1:04:23.540 --> 1:04:24.740
You're being really immature.

1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:30.140
You have no reason to be mad
at me. You broke my heart.

1:04:30.140 --> 1:04:32.440
I should be royally ticked off at you.

1:04:32.840 --> 1:04:36.340
I should be really cheesed off. I
shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.

1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:41.840
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with
you, and then I didn't wanna, like, marry you?

1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:45.340
Like I'd marry you! You'd
be the meanest wife ever.

1:04:45.540 --> 1:04:46.840
And I know that you
weren't bored that day

1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:48.740
because there was a lot of stuff on TV.

1:04:48.740 --> 1:04:51.540
The Blair Witch Project was
coming on Starz, and you were like,

1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:57.540
"I haven't seen this since it came out,
but we should make out instead. La la la. "

1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:02.940
You just take Katrina the
Douche Packer to the prom.

1:05:02.940 --> 1:05:04.840
I'm sure you two will
have a real bitchin' time!

1:05:07.740 --> 1:05:08.840
I still have your underwear.

1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:10.640
I still have your virginity!

1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:12.440
Would you shut up!

1:05:12.940 --> 1:05:14.440
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?

1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:16.340
- No.
- 'Cause at least

1:05:16.540 --> 1:05:18.640
you don't have to have the
evidence under your sweater.

1:05:21.140 --> 1:05:22.140
I'm a planet!

1:05:26.640 --> 1:05:27.840
Wait, let me get your bag.

1:05:29.040 --> 1:05:30.240
What's another ten pounds?

1:06:17.340 --> 1:06:18.240
Hi.

1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:19.940
Wow. That shirt's working hard.

1:06:20.340 --> 1:06:21.240
Is Vanessa here?

1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:23.340
No. We are safe.

1:06:25.540 --> 1:06:27.140
I'm glad you're here, I
actually have something for you.

1:06:32.040 --> 1:06:33.040
Almost there.

1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:39.540
Whoah, Mark! Is this the
baby's room? It's beautiful!

1:06:40.740 --> 1:06:41.540
Hilarious.

1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:43.940
This is where I keep all my old comics,

1:06:44.740 --> 1:06:45.640
And I want to show you one.

1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:47.940
You're one of those guys?

1:06:48.040 --> 1:06:49.240
Take a look.

1:06:52.840 --> 1:06:54.440
Most Fruitful Yuki?

1:06:55.940 --> 1:06:57.340
Is this a pregnant superhero?

1:06:57.940 --> 1:06:58.840
Isn't that great?

1:06:59.140 --> 1:07:00.440
I found it in Japan when
I was there with my band.

1:07:00.440 --> 1:07:01.040
It reminds me of you.

1:07:01.940 --> 1:07:03.040
Hells, yeah!

1:07:04.040 --> 1:07:07.140
This actually makes me
feel way less of a fat dork.

1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:10.240
Yuki is a real bad ass.

1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:12.540
You should be very proud
being in the same condition.

1:07:14.140 --> 1:07:14.840
Thank you.

1:07:16.140 --> 1:07:17.240
Oh, how about some tunage?

1:07:18.740 --> 1:07:20.340
Alright, don't look, no matter what.

1:07:23.340 --> 1:07:25.440
This one is actually kinda slow.

1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:29.840
But it's Mott the Hoople so it's
still totally rad and hardcore.

1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:36.340
I know this one.

1:07:36.740 --> 1:07:39.540
- You do?
- Yeah, this song is older than I am.

1:07:39.940 --> 1:07:41.740
I danced to this at my senior prom.

1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:44.540
Who'd you dance with?

1:07:45.340 --> 1:07:46.940
Cynthia Vogel, great dance partner.

1:07:46.940 --> 1:07:49.140
She let me put my
hands all over her butt.

1:07:49.340 --> 1:07:50.540
- Hot.
- Very hot.

1:07:52.140 --> 1:07:54.340
I can just, totally,
picture you dancing,

1:07:54.940 --> 1:07:56.540
Like a total dork!

1:07:59.740 --> 1:08:03.140
Her hands there,

1:08:04.040 --> 1:08:05.140
And my hands down here.

1:08:05.940 --> 1:08:07.440
This is how we did it in '88.

1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:08.840
Like this?

1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:10.140
Just like this.

1:08:10.340 --> 1:08:11.740
You've never been to a dance before?

1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:13.340
Dances are for nerds and squares.

1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:15.640
What are you?

1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:17.640
I don't know.

1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:21.340
I feel like there's
something between us.

1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:40.340
I'm leaving Vanessa.

1:08:43.940 --> 1:08:44.640
What?

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:46.740
I'm getting a place in the city.

1:08:46.740 --> 1:08:49.340
It's something I've wanted
to do for a long time.

1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:50.340
No!

1:08:51.140 --> 1:08:51.740
No?

1:08:52.140 --> 1:08:53.740
No! You definitely can't do that.

1:08:53.940 --> 1:08:55.140
That's one big, fat sack of no!

1:08:57.540 --> 1:08:58.540
What is the matter?

1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:02.840
You guys are supposed
to take care of this.

1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:07.040
I thought you'd be cool with this.

1:09:07.340 --> 1:09:09.040
I want things to be perfect.

1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:13.440
I don't want them to be shitty and
broken like everyone else's family.

1:09:15.340 --> 1:09:18.940
Look, I'll have the baby, and
Vanessa is going to be so happy.

1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:21.440
A baby is not going to fix everything.

1:09:21.740 --> 1:09:24.240
Besides, I don't know if I'm
even ready to be a father.

1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:25.840
But you're old!

1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:31.440
How do you think of me?

1:09:32.540 --> 1:09:33.840
Why are you over here?

1:09:37.540 --> 1:09:38.640
I...

1:09:39.540 --> 1:09:42.840
I just like being a piece of
furniture in your weird life.

1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:47.840
This is what my life has
become. I got stuff in boxes.

1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:50.740
I'm underground.
That's appealing to you?

1:09:51.140 --> 1:09:52.340
- This is my fault.
- No.

1:09:52.540 --> 1:09:54.340
Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?

1:09:54.940 --> 1:09:57.140
That's got nothing to do with it.
Vanessa and I aren't in love anymore.

1:09:57.740 --> 1:09:59.440
You were in love when you married her!

1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:02.540
If you're in love once,
you can be in love again.

1:10:02.540 --> 1:10:05.440
My friend Leah has been with the
same guy four different times.

1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:07.640
You're just not trying hard enough.

1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:08.940
I'm such an idiot. I can't
believe what an idiot I am.

1:10:09.140 --> 1:10:10.040
No, you know what, Mark.

1:10:10.540 --> 1:10:12.740
Do not divorce your wife!

1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:17.240
Will you please just do me a
solid and stay with Vanessa?

1:10:19.740 --> 1:10:20.540
You're so young.

1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:22.640
I'm not that young.
I'm sixteen.

1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:25.640
I'm old enough to know when
someone's acting like a total a-hole!

1:10:26.740 --> 1:10:27.740
Oh, and you know what,

1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:32.140
I bought another Sonic Youth album
and it sucks! It's just noise!

1:10:38.140 --> 1:10:39.340
Juno? What's going on?

1:10:40.940 --> 1:10:41.640
Nothing.

1:10:42.740 --> 1:10:43.440
Why are you crying?

1:10:44.540 --> 1:10:47.340
I'm not crying. I'm just
allergic to fine home furnishings.

1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:49.840
What's the matter?

1:10:50.540 --> 1:10:51.640
What's the matter?

1:10:52.340 --> 1:10:54.840
She's just a little
hormonal. Right, Juno?

1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:56.440
It's part of the process.

1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:01.840
What did you do?

1:11:04.340 --> 1:11:05.240
I didn't do anything...

1:11:07.340 --> 1:11:08.240
Just...

1:11:12.940 --> 1:11:13.840
I've been thinking.

1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:17.540
- What?
- Just thinking if this is the right thing.

1:11:19.540 --> 1:11:20.440
What are you talking about?

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:23.540
Just wondering if it's,

1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:25.440
Just wondering if we're ready.

1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:28.140
Yeah, we're ready.

1:11:28.540 --> 1:11:31.540
We're ready. We've read the
books, we've taken all the classes.

1:11:31.540 --> 1:11:33.440
We have a nursery that is completely...

1:11:33.940 --> 1:11:39.240
Vanessa, I know we're prepared.
I'm just wondering if... I'm ready.

1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:45.440
Wait a minute.

1:11:45.940 --> 1:11:49.040
Juno, don't listen to him.
He's just got cold feet.

1:11:49.540 --> 1:11:50.640
He's just being a guy.

1:11:50.940 --> 1:11:52.240
The books all say the same thing.

1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:54.240
A woman becomes a mother
when she gets pregnant.

1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:56.840
A man becomes a father
when he sees his baby.

1:11:58.340 --> 1:12:00.840
He's going to get there.

1:12:01.340 --> 1:12:02.140
It just happened so fast.

1:12:02.140 --> 1:12:05.240
We put the ad in the paper and I thought
it was gonna take months if at all and then,

1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:08.040
Two weeks later, she's on that couch.

1:12:08.540 --> 1:12:09.640
She answered our prayers.

1:12:09.940 --> 1:12:12.740
Ever since then it's
been like a ticking clock.

1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:18.140
What are you saying?

1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:22.840
That it feels a little like bad timing.

1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:28.440
What would be a good time for you, Mark?

1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:32.340
There's just some things
that I still want to do.

1:12:33.540 --> 1:12:34.740
Like what? Be a rock star?

1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:37.040
Don't mock me.

1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:39.940
I'm just saying that this is,

1:12:41.340 --> 1:12:42.640
This is something that's
never going to happen.

1:12:47.540 --> 1:12:48.440
Your shirt is stupid.

1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:51.040
Grow up.

1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:53.940
If I have to wait for
you to become Kurt Cobain,

1:12:53.940 --> 1:12:55.340
I'm never going to be a mother.

1:12:59.940 --> 1:13:01.140
I never said I'd be a good father.

1:15:57.540 --> 1:16:01.140
I called Gerta Rauss and she said
that she can represent both of us.

1:16:01.140 --> 1:16:03.240
It's called a "collaborative divorce. "

1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:06.240
It's all the rage right now, supposedly.

1:16:07.340 --> 1:16:08.940
And it would be pretty easy
because we don't have any children.

1:16:09.940 --> 1:16:11.140
Thanks for making the call, I guess.

1:16:19.340 --> 1:16:20.440
Have you found a place to stay yet?

1:16:21.340 --> 1:16:23.940
- Yeah, downtown.
- A hotel?

1:16:24.340 --> 1:16:26.440
No, it's not a hotel. It's a loft.

1:16:27.540 --> 1:16:28.640
Aren't you the cool guy?

1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:36.040
I wanted a baby so bad.

1:16:37.540 --> 1:16:38.640
I know.

1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:00.640
- It looks like a bill from
Jiffy-Lube. - It's for me.

1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:45.540
I never realize how much
I like being home unless

1:17:45.540 --> 1:17:47.740
I've been somewhere really
different for a while.

1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:57.940
Hey, Dad.

1:17:58.240 --> 1:17:59.540
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug.

1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:01.940
Where have you been?

1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:05.440
Dealing with things way
beyond my maturity level.

1:18:08.940 --> 1:18:09.940
Where is everybody?

1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:13.240
Bren took Liberty Bell to
her tot ice skating class.

1:18:14.740 --> 1:18:17.140
When will you guys learn
that tots can't ice skate?

1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:20.540
You're looking a little morose, honey.

1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:22.340
What's eating you?

1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:33.240
I'm just, like, losing
my faith with humanity.

1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:35.840
Can you narrow that down for me?

1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:38.540
I just...

1:18:38.940 --> 1:18:39.840
...wonder if...

1:18:41.540 --> 1:18:43.540
...two people can
stay together for good.

1:18:45.140 --> 1:18:46.040
You mean like couples?

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:47.240
Yeah, like,

1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:48.740
People in love.

1:18:50.340 --> 1:18:52.540
Are you having boy trouble
'cause I gotta be honest;

1:18:52.540 --> 1:18:54.940
I don't really much approve of
you dating in your condition,

1:18:55.940 --> 1:18:57.340
That's kind of messed up.

1:18:57.440 --> 1:18:58.240
No, dad!

1:18:58.940 --> 1:18:59.840
I mean, that's pretty skanky.

1:19:00.140 --> 1:19:02.040
Isn't that what you girls
call it? Skanky? Skeevy?

1:19:02.140 --> 1:19:03.340
Please stop.

1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:04.540
Tore up from the floor up?

1:19:04.940 --> 1:19:06.940
That's not what it's about.

1:19:11.140 --> 1:19:17.540
I just need to know that it's possible that
two people can stay happy together forever.

1:19:19.140 --> 1:19:20.440
It's not easy, that's for sure.

1:19:21.740 --> 1:19:24.940
I don't have the best track
record in the world, I know, but,

1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:28.040
I've been with your
stepmother for ten years now,

1:19:29.140 --> 1:19:30.440
and I'm proud to say
that we're very happy.

1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:33.740
Look...

1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:36.040
...In my opinion...

1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:42.540
The best thing you can do is find a person
who loves you for exactly what you are.

1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:47.240
Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty,

1:19:48.140 --> 1:19:49.640
Handsome, what have you,

1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:53.740
the right person is still gonna
think the sun shines out of your ass.

1:19:57.740 --> 1:19:59.140
That's the kind of person
that's worth sticking with.

1:20:00.740 --> 1:20:01.340
Yeah.

1:20:05.740 --> 1:20:07.440
I think I've found that person.

1:20:08.540 --> 1:20:09.940
Yeah, sure you
have. Your old D-A-D!

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:15.040
You know I'll always be there to love you, support
you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.

1:20:16.940 --> 1:20:17.940
Obviously.

1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:24.140
Dad, I think I'm just gonna,

1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:26.640
shove out for a sec, but,

1:20:27.340 --> 1:20:28.640
I won't be home late.

1:20:29.240 --> 1:20:30.040
Okay.

1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:32.540
You were talking about me, right?

1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:34.540
Oh, yeah.

1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:32.140
Hi.

1:21:34.540 --> 1:21:37.040
Did you put like a hundred
things of tic tacs in my mailbox?

1:21:37.740 --> 1:21:39.040
Oh, yeah, that was me.

1:21:40.340 --> 1:21:41.240
Why?

1:21:41.540 --> 1:21:43.040
They're your fave.

1:21:43.740 --> 1:21:46.640
You can never have too many of your
favorite one-calorie breath mint.

1:21:47.540 --> 1:21:49.440
Yeah, well thanks, I...

1:21:49.740 --> 1:21:52.640
...I think I'm pretty much set
until college on the tic tac front.

1:21:53.940 --> 1:21:55.140
You know, Bleek, I was thinking.

1:21:55.740 --> 1:21:59.440
I'm sorry I was such a huge bitch
to you. You don't deserve it.

1:22:00.740 --> 1:22:02.840
It's okay.

1:22:04.540 --> 1:22:05.540
Also,

1:22:07.940 --> 1:22:08.940
I think I'm in love with you.

1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:12.940
What, you mean as friends?

1:22:13.740 --> 1:22:14.540
No.

1:22:15.540 --> 1:22:16.740
I mean, for real.

1:22:17.640 --> 1:22:21.040
Because you're, like, the
coolest person I've ever met.

1:22:21.640 --> 1:22:23.540
And you don't even have to try.

1:22:26.140 --> 1:22:27.440
I try really hard, actually.

1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:29.240
You're, like, naturally smart.

1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:31.540
You're not like everyone else.

1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:34.640
You don't stare at my stomach
all the time, you look at my face.

1:22:35.340 --> 1:22:40.940
And every time I see you, the
baby starts kicking super hard.

1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:43.140
It does?

1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:58.340
I think it's because my heart
starts pounding every time I see you.

1:22:59.840 --> 1:23:00.740
Mine too.

1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:05.340
That's all I could ask for.

1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:09.940
You're golden, man.

1:23:13.240 --> 1:23:14.840
Can we make out now?

1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:17.440
Yeah.

1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:33.440
You know, you can go into early
labor sucking face like that!

1:23:57.640 --> 1:23:58.640
Dad!

1:23:59.740 --> 1:24:00.540
What?

1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:03.340
Dad, either I just peed my pants or...

1:24:05.140 --> 1:24:06.040
Or?

1:24:07.140 --> 1:24:08.840
Thundercats are go!

1:24:09.140 --> 1:24:09.940
All out, all out!

1:24:11.140 --> 1:24:12.140
Do you have the admittance form?

1:24:12.440 --> 1:24:13.940
What about the parking stickers?

1:24:14.140 --> 1:24:15.240
Have you got Liberty Bell?

1:24:15.440 --> 1:24:17.440
Oh, sweetie, sweetie!

1:24:21.340 --> 1:24:22.140
Here we go.

1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:26.840
Hurry! Start the car, go!

1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:28.740
Gas!

1:24:33.140 --> 1:24:35.440
- Wait, wait!
- Out of the way!

1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:40.540
- Don't do that.
- What?

1:24:40.940 --> 1:24:42.440
- That.
- But it's fun!

1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:46.940
Bren, when do I get that
friggin' Spinal Tap thing?

1:24:47.740 --> 1:24:50.240
It's called a spinal block, and
you can't have it yet, honey.

1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:52.140
The doctor said you're
not dilated enough.

1:24:52.540 --> 1:24:55.240
Come on! I have to wait
for it to get worse?

1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:57.940
Why can't I just have
the friggin' thing now?

1:24:58.540 --> 1:25:02.140
Honey, doctors are sadists who like to
play God and watch lesser people scream.

1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:04.240
Oh, shit.

1:25:04.940 --> 1:25:08.340
Excuse me! Can we give my kid
the damn spinal tap already?

1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:38.940
And then...

1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:41.240
...out of nowhere...

1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:43.240
...there it was...

1:25:44.940 --> 1:25:46.140
There he was.

1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:55.540
I decided not to call Bleeker to
tell him that I was having the baby.

1:25:56.240 --> 1:26:00.340
He had a big meet against Manteno and I
didn't want him to get all worried about me.

1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:07.140
But he figured it out anyway.

1:26:25.140 --> 1:26:26.840
Someday you'll be back here, honey.

1:26:29.540 --> 1:26:30.640
On your terms.

1:26:43.140 --> 1:26:44.140
Hey.

1:26:44.940 --> 1:26:46.940
Nice legs.

1:27:28.740 --> 1:27:30.340
Bleeker decided he didn't
want to see the baby.

1:27:32.340 --> 1:27:35.240
Neither did I, really.
He didn't feel like ours.

1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:44.440
I think he was always hers.

1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:50.640
Would you like to meet your son?

1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:54.940
I have a son?

1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:23.840
How do I look?

1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:26.540
Like a new mom.

1:28:27.340 --> 1:28:28.540
Scared shitless.

1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:56.140
It ended with a chair.

1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:58.340
As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally
boss. He is the cheese to my macaroni.

1:30:00.740 --> 1:30:03.440
I know people are supposed to fall
in love before they reproduce, but,

1:30:04.640 --> 1:30:06.240
I guess normalcy's not really our style.

1:30:13.440 --> 1:30:14.140
Hey.

1:30:14.640 --> 1:30:15.840
Hey.

1:30:20.740 --> 1:30:21.540
Ready?

1:30:21.940 --> 1:30:23.140
Yeah.
