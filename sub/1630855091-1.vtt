1
00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:13.370
You disappeared on me.
We had an appointment.

2
00:01:14.537 --> 00:01:15.706
The mountains called.

3
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:19.644
Sadie, it's normal
to be affected by what happened.

4
00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:22.813
Death, anyone's, can fill us with urgency.

5
00:01:22.837 --> 00:01:24.691
This is not about what happened.

6
00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:26.924
I didn't really know her, but...

7
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:29.945
She was the same as me.

8
00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.888
Same age, same job.

9
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.534
The one time I was in her house,
it was the same as mine.

10
00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:37.954
Nice, but cold.

11
00:01:37.978 --> 00:01:43.817
Empty, except for one sad houseplant,
which is more than I have.

12
00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:45.777
She died alone.

13
00:01:46.402 --> 00:01:51.158
Sadie, stay present.
No big moves, no big changes.

14
00:01:53.242 --> 00:01:55.579
So don't marry
the rafting guide I just met?

15
00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:57.848
Maybe start with a houseplant.

16
00:01:57.872 --> 00:01:59.558
I'd probably eat it.

17
00:01:59.582 --> 00:02:02.477
My cold, empty house has a cold,
empty fridge.

18
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:04.563
I'm gonna stop for groceries.

19
00:02:04.587 --> 00:02:06.715
- Let's check in tomorrow.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.556
No pesticides, more nutrients.
It just tastes better, you know.

21
00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:17.893
Out of 20.

22
00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:23.649
Sorry, guys.

23
00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:38.121
Five, six, seven. Have a good one.

24
00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.519
You know you're gonna need
to buy stock in those trackers.

25
00:02:42.543 --> 00:02:44.711
You'd lose your butt
if it wasn't attached to you.

26
00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:47.341
Well, you lost your hair,
and that was attached.

27
00:02:48.257 --> 00:02:49.651
I walked into that one.

28
00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:52.051
Hey, Cole. Are you okay?

29
00:02:52.844 --> 00:02:55.514
Yeah, heard you got dumped.
Tough break, man.

30
00:02:57.265 --> 00:03:00.286
- Edna.
- I gossip when I'm bored.

31
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.330
For your information, it was mutual.

32
00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:04.206
That's what everyone says
after getting dumped.

33
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.375
That's true.

34
00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:07.502
Maybe try being a little less needy,
you know?

35
00:03:07.526 --> 00:03:09.002
Girls don't really like that.

36
00:03:09.026 --> 00:03:10.236
I'm not needy.

37
00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:13.967
We just grew apart.

38
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.033
And I really just don't wanna talk
about it.

39
00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:20.454
You wanna go get high?

40
00:03:22.123 --> 00:03:23.876
I got a edible in the truck.

41
00:03:25.627 --> 00:03:26.937
No, thanks.

42
00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:29.338
Okay. Well, watch my booth.
I'm gonna go get high.

43
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:32.091
Enjoy.

44
00:03:33.468 --> 00:03:35.780
- Come on. Here.
- Uh, just that one.

45
00:03:35.804 --> 00:03:39.348
- Just this one.
- I'll take one too.

46
00:03:44.062 --> 00:03:46.355
Salmon. Halibut. It's all fresh.

47
00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.493
Can I help you?

48
00:04:02.622 --> 00:04:05.459
Yes, thank you. I'm gonna get that one.

49
00:04:07.627 --> 00:04:09.104
Begonia. Nice choice.

50
00:04:09.128 --> 00:04:11.340
- Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.485
It is pretty.

52
00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:15.593
Yeah.

53
00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:23.226
Don't let any pets eat the leaves.
They can be slightly toxic.

54
00:04:24.894 --> 00:04:26.562
Pretty and slightly toxic.

55
00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:29.625
What is it with me and roommates?

56
00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:31.817
Didn't realize you roomed
with all of my exes.

57
00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:40.576
How much watering does it need?

58
00:04:41.245 --> 00:04:44.540
Every other day or so.
Begonias need a little bit of love.

59
00:04:47.292 --> 00:04:50.379
I'm actually gone a lot for work.

60
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.439
Okay.

61
00:04:52.463 --> 00:04:55.050
Okay, got it. Less love.

62
00:04:56.343 --> 00:04:57.427
What about a snake plant?

63
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:00.012
They only need watering every two weeks.

64
00:05:01.723 --> 00:05:06.019
Sometimes I'm gone longer,
like a month or two.

65
00:05:06.937 --> 00:05:08.062
Okay.

66
00:05:09.398 --> 00:05:12.084
Sorry, then why do you want a plant
if you're never home?

67
00:05:12.108 --> 00:05:14.194
I'm not never home. I just...

68
00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:19.031
How about if you find me
something a little less needy?

69
00:05:20.992 --> 00:05:25.014
Right. Why not just get a plastic plant?

70
00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:26.266
That's sad.

71
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.915
Well, not as sad as killing a plant.

72
00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:31.420
And some of the new ones,
they look totally real.

73
00:05:32.004 --> 00:05:33.814
No amount of neglect will kill them.

74
00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:35.340
Neglect?

75
00:05:36.425 --> 00:05:38.319
You know what, I'm gonna get this one.

76
00:05:38.343 --> 00:05:40.971
- Yep.
- Thank you.

77
00:05:46.643 --> 00:05:49.663
Sorry, I can't sell you this plant.

78
00:05:49.687 --> 00:05:52.082
I can't sell it to you in good conscience.

79
00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:55.920
Good conscience?
What are you, the patron saint of plants?

80
00:05:55.944 --> 00:05:58.380
I just don't feel comfortable
selling a plant to someone

81
00:05:58.404 --> 00:05:59.548
that can be so indifferent

82
00:05:59.572 --> 00:06:00.966
- towards a living thing.
- Indifferent?

83
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.968
Is this how you speak
to all your customers?

84
00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:05.096
'Cause if you do,
I'm shocked that you sell anything at all.

85
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.139
No, as a matter of fact,
this isn't even my stall.

86
00:06:07.163 --> 00:06:08.557
I just don't wanna be an accomplice...

87
00:06:08.581 --> 00:06:10.685
You're refusing to sell me a plant
that you don't even own?

88
00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:11.894
- That's right.
- Hey, Cole.

89
00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:13.937
- What's going on?
- Hi.

90
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:15.899
- Are these your plants?
- Yes.

91
00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:18.401
Awesome. 'Cause Farmer Clown here
won't sell me one.

92
00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:21.028
- Farmer Clown. That's funny.
- The plant is $10, honey.

93
00:06:21.052 --> 00:06:22.822
Edna, sh...

94
00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:26.391
All right, you know what?
Hey, want a plant? Here. Cactus.

95
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:29.120
Requires the bare minimum love
a human can give,

96
00:06:29.144 --> 00:06:30.978
so you'll totally kill it.

97
00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:36.026
You should fire him.

98
00:06:36.985 --> 00:06:39.004
- She's just gonna...
- Have a good one.

99
00:06:39.028 --> 00:06:40.531
RIP, little guy.

100
00:06:41.656 --> 00:06:43.509
- Can you believe that?
- No.

101
00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:46.095
I thought for sure you two
were gonna exchange numbers.

102
00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:47.805
- What?
- Yes.

103
00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:50.557
I thought, under all that stupid fighting,
you were flirting.

104
00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:52.851
- Wait, we were flirting?
- Are you kidding me?

105
00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:57.088
Are you high?
The sexual tension was off the charts.

106
00:07:01.468 --> 00:07:02.677
Edna, watch my stall.

107
00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:05.365
Hey, hey, hey, sorr...

108
00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:07.891
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- Shit.

109
00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:13.872
Hi. Hi. Yep, it's me.

110
00:07:13.896 --> 00:07:15.524
Sorry. Just...

111
00:07:17.692 --> 00:07:19.920
Are you here to rescue the plant?

112
00:07:19.944 --> 00:07:22.281
No. No, I'm not. That's funny.

113
00:07:23.156 --> 00:07:24.156
No, I was just...

114
00:07:25.367 --> 00:07:27.086
Well, I was just wondering
if you wanted to,

115
00:07:27.952 --> 00:07:30.163
you know, go out sometime.

116
00:07:31.956 --> 00:07:33.875
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

117
00:07:34.668 --> 00:07:35.711
Yeah, I mean, I...

118
00:07:36.836 --> 00:07:38.629
I mean, I know we were kind of...

119
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.274
arguing back there,

120
00:07:40.298 --> 00:07:43.802
but I thought that underneath it,
there was...

121
00:07:45.928 --> 00:07:46.928
something.

122
00:07:48.014 --> 00:07:49.617
Something?

123
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:51.518
Yeah.

124
00:07:53.103 --> 00:07:54.353
I'm wrong, aren't I?

125
00:07:56.355 --> 00:07:57.691
Well, this is embarrassing.

126
00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:04.113
Sorry, sorry. I misread it.

127
00:08:16.918 --> 00:08:18.187
I can use a coffee.

128
00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:22.382
A coffee?
You want to get a... Yeah. Like, now?

129
00:08:23.175 --> 00:08:24.509
Yes, now.

130
00:08:26.427 --> 00:08:27.404
Get in.

131
00:08:27.428 --> 00:08:29.598
Yeah, well... Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:08:33.976 --> 00:08:36.331
- I'm Cole, by the way.
- Seat belt.

133
00:08:36.355 --> 00:08:38.188
Yep, yep, yep. Sorry.

134
00:08:40.609 --> 00:08:41.902
I'll just hang on.

135
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:45.029
Okay.

136
00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:59.836
I like the canal.
It reminds me of Amsterdam.

137
00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:02.606
So, art curators travel a lot?

138
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.384
Oh, yeah. All over the world.

139
00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.904
I love it.

140
00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:12.158
Just jumping on a plane, moment's notice,

141
00:09:12.182 --> 00:09:15.686
and then, you know,
stepping out into a new place.

142
00:09:17.104 --> 00:09:18.230
Wow.

143
00:09:19.898 --> 00:09:22.168
Oh, gosh,
don't tell me you're one of those big,

144
00:09:22.192 --> 00:09:24.879
tough guys who's afraid
to leave the country.

145
00:09:24.903 --> 00:09:27.548
Okay, first of all,
thank you for calling me big and tough.

146
00:09:27.572 --> 00:09:31.076
Let's keep that going.
And I travel. I travel a lot.

147
00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:33.953
- Really?
- Yeah.

148
00:09:34.453 --> 00:09:36.224
Yeah, I think the trips
that you plan the least

149
00:09:36.248 --> 00:09:38.000
are the ones that give you the most.

150
00:09:41.294 --> 00:09:42.461
I agree.

151
00:09:44.965 --> 00:09:47.818
Lincoln got shot just across
the street, and he died right next door.

152
00:09:47.842 --> 00:09:49.886
Sounds like you're a big fan of Lincoln.

153
00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:52.221
Well, history in general.

154
00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:54.993
I majored in agriculture,
but I minored in history.

155
00:09:55.017 --> 00:09:56.225
That's my real passion.

156
00:09:57.436 --> 00:09:58.644
You know, I'm writing a book.

157
00:09:59.395 --> 00:10:01.315
- You are?
- Yeah.

158
00:10:03.024 --> 00:10:04.359
History of farming?

159
00:10:04.902 --> 00:10:08.298
No, it's about the rise
and fall of different empires

160
00:10:08.322 --> 00:10:10.532
and the critical role that agriculture...

161
00:10:11.115 --> 00:10:12.533
Yeah, it's about farming.

162
00:10:14.202 --> 00:10:15.495
So how's it going?

163
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.932
Well, it's on pause for now.

164
00:10:18.956 --> 00:10:22.644
My dad got hurt a few years ago,
so I came back to help him with the farm.

165
00:10:22.668 --> 00:10:24.879
So not a lot of time for writing.

166
00:10:25.963 --> 00:10:27.192
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:27.216 --> 00:10:29.592
It's okay. I'll finish it.

168
00:10:31.886 --> 00:10:34.490
You've never seen The Exorcist?
It's a classic.

169
00:10:34.514 --> 00:10:38.369
It's one of the scariest movies ever made,
and they filmed it right here.

170
00:10:38.393 --> 00:10:40.245
I don't know.
I don't get scared by movies.

171
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:42.915
Yeah,
because you haven't seen The Exorcist.

172
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.442
No, 'cause you can choose
not being scared.

173
00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:49.071
Okay. Little bet. Race me to the top.

174
00:10:49.654 --> 00:10:52.490
And if I beat you,
you gotta tell me what scares you.

175
00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:56.912
- I love this.
- All right. I like the confidence.

176
00:10:57.412 --> 00:10:59.748
Hang on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me just... Hang on.

177
00:11:01.207 --> 00:11:04.229
Come on. Put all that in here.

178
00:11:04.253 --> 00:11:08.173
Are you gonna carry all my stuff?
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

179
00:11:09.466 --> 00:11:10.943
You looking for pity?

180
00:11:10.967 --> 00:11:13.052
That's exactly what I'm looking for.

181
00:11:15.013 --> 00:11:16.073
Oh, my friend.

182
00:11:16.097 --> 00:11:18.868
- You ready?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:18.892 --> 00:11:21.019
And go!

184
00:11:42.624 --> 00:11:44.125
You know, I'm guessing you work out.

185
00:11:45.293 --> 00:11:46.461
Are you okay?

186
00:11:47.086 --> 00:11:48.087
Oh, yeah.

187
00:11:54.469 --> 00:11:56.638
Oh, my God. I love Monet.

188
00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:11.068
So you can just choose not
to be scared, huh?

189
00:12:15.823 --> 00:12:16.926
When I was six,

190
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.827
my mom and I fled our country...

191
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.413
on a raft.

192
00:12:23.331 --> 00:12:25.475
Oh, my God. That must have been...

193
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.251
Worse than you can imagine.

194
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:33.926
The sun, the waves,
sharks, people screaming, crying.

195
00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:36.613
I was terrified. Everyone was.

196
00:12:36.636 --> 00:12:41.182
They wanted to go back,
but my mom was so strong.

197
00:12:42.267 --> 00:12:45.937
She kept us all going for five days,

198
00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:48.981
until we made it.

199
00:12:50.274 --> 00:12:54.028
And I still remember how they looked
at her on the beach.

200
00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:59.344
I just, you know, wanted to be like her,

201
00:12:59.368 --> 00:13:01.537
strong and brave.

202
00:13:02.578 --> 00:13:07.375
So that's the day I decided I was never
going to be afraid ever again.

203
00:13:09.669 --> 00:13:10.711
And I'm not.

204
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:16.634
I believe you.

205
00:13:18.261 --> 00:13:21.365
But it is very cute that you're scared
of this movie with the little girl.

206
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:24.661
- Oh, my God. This is my own fault.
- That's... What's the name again?

207
00:13:24.684 --> 00:13:26.287
- It's The Exorcist.
- I have to watch it now.

208
00:13:26.311 --> 00:13:29.081
One of the scariest movies of all time.
You're gonna have nightmares for a month.

209
00:13:29.105 --> 00:13:30.190
- Wow.
- Just watch.

210
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.840
This has just been incredible.

211
00:13:36.864 --> 00:13:38.115
It was great.

212
00:13:39.157 --> 00:13:40.884
And not to be too forward,

213
00:13:40.908 --> 00:13:44.304
but if you ever felt
like getting a drink sometime...

214
00:13:44.328 --> 00:13:45.413
How about now?

215
00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:48.040
Okay.

216
00:13:48.834 --> 00:13:50.335
I know a great place.

217
00:14:00.386 --> 00:14:01.471
Hey!

218
00:14:09.145 --> 00:14:10.688
Thank you.

219
00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:13.168
You are amazing.

220
00:14:13.192 --> 00:14:15.211
How do you make that look cool?

221
00:14:15.235 --> 00:14:17.297
That's rockaoke. No dignity here.

222
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:21.240
And next up, we have Cole Turner,
turnin' up the heat

223
00:14:21.866 --> 00:14:24.244
- with "20th Century Boy."
- What happened?

224
00:14:25.662 --> 00:14:28.265
- No, no, no, no, no. No, no.
- I might have put your name down.

225
00:14:28.289 --> 00:14:29.893
- Come on, Cole.
- Sadie. Sadie.

226
00:14:29.917 --> 00:14:32.019
Sadie,
I get nervous singing in the shower.

227
00:14:32.043 --> 00:14:33.520
- Just give it a go.
- I'm not a performer.

228
00:14:33.544 --> 00:14:35.773
- Cole! Cole! Cole!
- Cole Turner.

229
00:14:35.797 --> 00:14:38.067
- Where is Cole Turner?
- Please.

230
00:14:38.091 --> 00:14:39.467
I can't.

231
00:14:40.635 --> 00:14:42.678
He's not gonna do it.
Just call someone else.

232
00:14:43.346 --> 00:14:45.139
Give me the mic.

233
00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:49.809
Thank you.

234
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.956
Now, you're out there,
seeing the world, traveling,

235
00:15:09.998 --> 00:15:13.710
meeting interesting people.
It's quite a life.

236
00:15:15.671 --> 00:15:17.172
Lately, I'm not so sure.

237
00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:22.635
Someone I know just died. A coworker.

238
00:15:24.596 --> 00:15:26.097
It got me thinking.

239
00:15:27.724 --> 00:15:30.561
You know, there are all
these things you want in life...

240
00:15:31.562 --> 00:15:34.981
and it's so hard to find someone who...

241
00:15:38.902 --> 00:15:41.673
If only people
could be more like your cactus.

242
00:15:41.697 --> 00:15:43.573
Not needing watering all the time?

243
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.134
Right. Exactly.

244
00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:48.971
- Just living their own lives.
- Yeah.

245
00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:51.664
Not needing someone else,
like, nourishing them.

246
00:15:52.249 --> 00:15:53.542
That makes sense.

247
00:16:33.915 --> 00:16:34.893
Morning.

248
00:16:34.917 --> 00:16:38.086
- What?
- Nothing.

249
00:16:40.838 --> 00:16:42.442
Good night then.

250
00:16:42.466 --> 00:16:43.775
I mean, good morning.

251
00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:45.360
This was quite a date.

252
00:16:45.384 --> 00:16:46.886
You mean a day?

253
00:16:47.596 --> 00:16:51.158
Right. Yeah, that's... Officially.
That's a first.

254
00:16:51.182 --> 00:16:52.934
Yeah, me too.

255
00:16:57.397 --> 00:16:59.942
Well, goodbye.

256
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:02.735
Goodbye.

257
00:17:19.795 --> 00:17:25.049
Well, I look forward to our next day.

258
00:17:28.886 --> 00:17:31.097
- Bye.
- Bye.

259
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:48.215
Be a cactus.

260
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.720
No big moves. No big moves.

261
00:17:52.743 --> 00:17:54.704
Be a cactus.

262
00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:35.162
Wow.

263
00:18:37.663 --> 00:18:38.999
First farmer?

264
00:18:42.501 --> 00:18:43.502
Yeah.

265
00:18:44.003 --> 00:18:46.923
You know that power you felt?
That's from the land.

266
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.387
Hey, Coleslaw.

267
00:19:17.412 --> 00:19:18.556
Hey, Dad.

268
00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:20.724
Thanks for closing up the stand
for me last night.

269
00:19:20.749 --> 00:19:23.353
Not a problem.
Edna gave me a hand. She was high.

270
00:19:23.376 --> 00:19:26.021
Look who's finally home.

271
00:19:26.046 --> 00:19:27.481
God, take it easy, Mom.

272
00:19:27.506 --> 00:19:29.317
He just got back
from having sex with a stranger,

273
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.859
not fighting the Germans.

274
00:19:30.884 --> 00:19:34.447
Okay, now, come on. Spill the beans.

275
00:19:34.471 --> 00:19:38.267
Well, her name is Sadie, and she is...

276
00:19:40.143 --> 00:19:43.205
She's incredible.
I mean, I know this sounds a little crazy,

277
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:47.150
but I think she might be the one.

278
00:19:48.277 --> 00:19:49.837
Really? Well, that's fast.

279
00:19:49.862 --> 00:19:51.881
Well, I can't wait to meet her.

280
00:19:51.904 --> 00:19:54.259
Did you tell her you wrestled
in high school?

281
00:19:54.282 --> 00:19:56.802
- No.
- What is this?

282
00:19:56.826 --> 00:19:59.638
You took a selfie
in bed while she was asleep?

283
00:19:59.663 --> 00:20:00.932
Dude, that's weird.

284
00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:03.726
That's what serial killers do
before they kill their victims

285
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.935
and harvest their eyelids.

286
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.355
I was happy.
I wanted to preserve the moment.

287
00:20:07.378 --> 00:20:10.357
- He is doing it again.
- Doing what?

288
00:20:10.382 --> 00:20:13.736
It's just... Cole, you can get a bit...

289
00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:14.945
Smothering, needy, pathetic,

290
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.280
- desperate, delusional.
- What?

291
00:20:16.305 --> 00:20:19.659
Yeah, stuff like this.
The stupid gifts, the constant texting.

292
00:20:19.682 --> 00:20:21.869
I mean, that's why things never
worked out with Fiona.

293
00:20:21.894 --> 00:20:23.186
Fiona was a bitch.

294
00:20:23.769 --> 00:20:26.082
You're a hopeless romantic,
just like your mom.

295
00:20:26.105 --> 00:20:27.791
Tell her you wrestled in high school.

296
00:20:27.816 --> 00:20:31.003
Look, I'm not needy,
and I'm not smothering.

297
00:20:31.028 --> 00:20:34.698
And for your information,
I've sent Sadie one text today. One.

298
00:20:36.616 --> 00:20:40.637
Three. And some light emoji stuff,
but that doesn't count.

299
00:20:40.662 --> 00:20:41.972
Emoji stuff counts.

300
00:20:41.997 --> 00:20:45.018
He is gonna blow it. Mark my words.

301
00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:46.125
I'm not gonna bl...

302
00:20:47.586 --> 00:20:48.836
She really is great.

303
00:20:50.422 --> 00:20:51.423
You'll see.

304
00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:19.451
Hey. Head in the game, Coleslaw.
Come on. A lot of honey to harvest.

305
00:21:33.965 --> 00:21:34.965
You need some slack?

306
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.346
We're good. Hang on.
Just gotta hook it in. One sec.

307
00:21:41.013 --> 00:21:46.686
Should I get it? I can get it.
It's right here. So easy for me.

308
00:21:49.355 --> 00:21:50.356
Hello?

309
00:21:55.695 --> 00:21:56.798
Good news.

310
00:21:56.822 --> 00:21:59.240
Mortgage refinancing rates
have never been lower.

311
00:22:12.921 --> 00:22:13.922
Any word?

312
00:22:17.175 --> 00:22:18.653
Maybe your phone's broken.

313
00:22:18.676 --> 00:22:20.320
Yeah, maybe you should do a hard reset.

314
00:22:20.345 --> 00:22:22.699
There's nothing wrong with my phone.

315
00:22:22.722 --> 00:22:24.909
No, no, no, I meant with your life.

316
00:22:24.932 --> 00:22:27.537
You know, grow a pair,
move out of your parents' house.

317
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.686
Guesthouse.

318
00:22:29.688 --> 00:22:32.291
Well, I'm sure
there's a logical reason for it.

319
00:22:32.316 --> 00:22:33.667
There is.

320
00:22:33.692 --> 00:22:37.046
He came off way too strong,
so she ghosted him.

321
00:22:37.069 --> 00:22:38.131
Ghosted?

322
00:22:38.154 --> 00:22:40.674
Yeah.
It's when someone breaks off all contact.

323
00:22:40.699 --> 00:22:43.760
For example, let's just say a young lady
makes a horrible,

324
00:22:43.785 --> 00:22:45.180
horrible mistake one night,

325
00:22:45.203 --> 00:22:48.766
and then the guy just keeps
on texting her with emojis,

326
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:50.476
over and over.

327
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.544
She did not ghost me, okay?

328
00:22:54.212 --> 00:22:55.690
- She did.
- You wanna pick this up?

329
00:22:55.713 --> 00:22:56.900
No.

330
00:22:56.923 --> 00:23:00.719
Hey, pal, you're huffing and puffing.
Why don't you take a hit off your scuba?

331
00:23:01.345 --> 00:23:03.596
Come on, hey. Let's go.

332
00:23:07.518 --> 00:23:08.602
Oh, my God.

333
00:23:10.354 --> 00:23:13.665
Sorry. You did the leave-behind
with your inhaler?

334
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.376
Come on.
Isn't your asthma sad enough already?

335
00:23:16.401 --> 00:23:18.630
It wasn't a leave-behind.
I forgot it in her purse.

336
00:23:18.653 --> 00:23:22.699
And it has one of those tiles on it.
Those tracking things that I use.

337
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.637
All right. Drumroll, please.

338
00:23:26.662 --> 00:23:29.205
The woman of my dreams is in...

339
00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:32.352
- London.
- England?

340
00:23:32.375 --> 00:23:35.480
- London, the Lady in the Mist.
- No one calls it that.

341
00:23:35.503 --> 00:23:37.981
- The Gray Lady.
- No, that's New York Times.

342
00:23:38.006 --> 00:23:40.234
- Are ya sure?
- Yes.

343
00:23:40.259 --> 00:23:41.736
She does travel a lot for work.

344
00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:43.570
Well, there you go. That makes sense.

345
00:23:43.595 --> 00:23:46.574
She probably got called away last minute
on this job and had to rush over there.

346
00:23:46.597 --> 00:23:49.368
You know,
international calling plans and whatnot.

347
00:23:49.393 --> 00:23:51.328
I bet she hasn't even seen your texts.

348
00:23:51.353 --> 00:23:53.664
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Okay.

349
00:23:53.689 --> 00:23:55.666
- Exactly.
- Okay, so this is fine?

350
00:23:55.691 --> 00:23:57.167
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

351
00:23:57.192 --> 00:24:00.171
Cole, you should go over there.

352
00:24:00.194 --> 00:24:03.298
- What?
- Yeah, show up and surprise her.

353
00:24:03.323 --> 00:24:06.510
It'd be a romantic gesture,
something we can tell our grandchildren.

354
00:24:06.535 --> 00:24:10.013
Mom, you can't be serious.
Cole, going to London? No.

355
00:24:10.038 --> 00:24:12.267
Why not? This is a perfect opportunity

356
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.979
to get out there
and grab life by the horns.

357
00:24:16.002 --> 00:24:17.282
She's gonna think you're psycho.

358
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.441
Or she'll think that I'm the kind of guy

359
00:24:20.464 --> 00:24:22.527
that's willing to jump
on a plane at a moment's notice.

360
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.113
Wait, but you're not that kind of guy.
You do not travel anywhere.

361
00:24:25.136 --> 00:24:27.198
- You haven't even left the country.
- That's not true.

362
00:24:27.221 --> 00:24:28.866
He was conceived in Ontario.

363
00:24:28.891 --> 00:24:30.410
Cole, you can do this.

364
00:24:30.433 --> 00:24:32.244
Yeah, but what about the farm?
There's so much to do.

365
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:35.414
- I can't just leave you here.
- Coleslaw, don't worry about the farm.

366
00:24:35.439 --> 00:24:37.916
- Yeah.
- By the horns. Come on.

367
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:39.233
Yeah, go to her.

368
00:24:41.319 --> 00:24:42.297
You know what I have?

369
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.008
You remember that spring break
where I was supposed to go to Spain

370
00:24:45.031 --> 00:24:46.800
and I gave up my seat and I got a voucher?

371
00:24:46.825 --> 00:24:48.677
That is my point exactly, Cole.

372
00:24:48.701 --> 00:24:52.265
You missed spring break
to get a stupid voucher,

373
00:24:52.288 --> 00:24:54.392
which you never used.

374
00:24:54.415 --> 00:24:56.644
I mean, that is the type of guy you are.

375
00:24:56.667 --> 00:24:57.769
Not today.

376
00:24:57.794 --> 00:25:01.381
- You still have...
- I've got goose bumps.

377
00:25:02.089 --> 00:25:02.984
Thanks for the warning.

378
00:25:03.009 --> 00:25:04.593
I'm going to London.

379
00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:17.539
So it's not like a weird stalker thing.
It's just a grand romantic gesture.

380
00:25:17.564 --> 00:25:20.919
Yeah, that is amazing, mate.
I mean, I admire your confidence.

381
00:25:20.942 --> 00:25:24.838
5,000 miles to surprise a girl
who you've only met once.

382
00:25:24.863 --> 00:25:26.798
I mean,
that is the epitome of romance, mate.

383
00:25:26.823 --> 00:25:28.550
Yeah, exactly. See, you get it.

384
00:25:28.575 --> 00:25:30.845
Especially if she's the one
who ghosted you.

385
00:25:30.868 --> 00:25:33.556
I was... Wait, what?
No, no, she didn't ghost me.

386
00:25:33.579 --> 00:25:35.624
She just doesn't
have an international calling plan.

387
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.393
Right.

388
00:25:37.416 --> 00:25:41.396
An international art curator,
doesn't have an overseas calling plan.

389
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:42.631
That's very unusual.

390
00:25:44.258 --> 00:25:45.567
Talking of romantic gestures,

391
00:25:45.592 --> 00:25:47.444
what's that you got in the back then, hey?

392
00:25:47.469 --> 00:25:49.489
- Is it a little cactus, is it?
- Yeah.

393
00:25:49.512 --> 00:25:53.409
Yeah, this is a little inside joke
between us.

394
00:25:53.432 --> 00:25:56.561
Little cactus.
I'm sure she'll split her sides laughing.

395
00:25:59.522 --> 00:26:04.653
Right, we are nearly here. Tower Bridge.

396
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.201
That'll be 137 quid, please.

397
00:26:13.412 --> 00:26:16.307
- That's kind of a lot, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's outrageous.

398
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.059
You never get a cab from the airport
to the center of London.

399
00:26:19.084 --> 00:26:22.671
It'll cost you a small fortune, mate.
Yeah. Toodle-pip.

400
00:26:33.848 --> 00:26:36.184
Take care, now. Thanks very much.

401
00:26:37.435 --> 00:26:41.522
Have a good evening. Have a good night.

402
00:28:07.358 --> 00:28:12.823
Let me tell you how
this will be. One for you, 19 for me.

403
00:28:13.323 --> 00:28:16.034
'Cause I'm the taxman.

404
00:28:16.785 --> 00:28:17.846
Listen to me.

405
00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:21.473
I can't believe I'm quoting
"The Taxman" to you.

406
00:28:21.498 --> 00:28:25.686
So lame. I really am turning into my dad.

407
00:28:25.711 --> 00:28:27.188
It's true what they say.

408
00:28:27.211 --> 00:28:31.383
When you meet a celebrity,
your IQ drops 50 points.

409
00:28:32.175 --> 00:28:34.778
- Where am I?
- It's just... You're a living legend.

410
00:28:34.802 --> 00:28:37.490
Stopping our shipment in Turkey,

411
00:28:37.513 --> 00:28:39.266
the assassination in Berlin

412
00:28:39.892 --> 00:28:42.871
and now this thing with Elena
and the passcode.

413
00:28:42.894 --> 00:28:47.875
The boss talks about you all the time.
You've become an obsession for him.

414
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.005
"The Taxman killed Elena.
The Taxman has the passcode.

415
00:28:52.028 --> 00:28:55.799
Oh, how I want to find
and murder the Taxman."

416
00:28:55.824 --> 00:28:57.719
And now here you are.

417
00:28:57.742 --> 00:29:00.346
No, no, I'm not a taxman. I'm a farmer.

418
00:29:00.369 --> 00:29:05.393
I came to London to surprise a girl,
and these guys, they jumped me.

419
00:29:05.416 --> 00:29:06.769
Textbook evasion.

420
00:29:06.792 --> 00:29:10.481
Frankly, a little disappointing,
but the performance?

421
00:29:10.506 --> 00:29:11.691
Sublime.

422
00:29:11.714 --> 00:29:13.859
It's like you truly believe
what you're saying.

423
00:29:13.884 --> 00:29:15.236
Because I'm telling the truth.

424
00:29:15.259 --> 00:29:17.446
You have the wrong guy.
My name is Cole Turner.

425
00:29:17.471 --> 00:29:19.740
My passport's right over there in the bag,
in the front flap.

426
00:29:19.765 --> 00:29:24.519
Sublime.
It truly is an honor to torture you today.

427
00:29:25.229 --> 00:29:27.664
Okay, just wait. Wait.

428
00:29:27.689 --> 00:29:31.067
- Normally, I begin with the punching.
- Wait a minute.

429
00:29:32.986 --> 00:29:36.340
You see, it causes me a little pain too.

430
00:29:36.365 --> 00:29:39.594
I'm all about sharing the experience.

431
00:29:39.617 --> 00:29:42.180
My therapist says that I'm an empath,

432
00:29:42.203 --> 00:29:46.040
which means that I'm deeply attuned
to others' feelings.

433
00:29:47.084 --> 00:29:52.548
But alas, the boss is in a real tizzy
about the passcode.

434
00:29:54.383 --> 00:29:58.445
Are you familiar
with the Schmidt sting pain index?

435
00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.074
Wait, the what? Wait a minute.

436
00:30:01.097 --> 00:30:06.519
It's a rating system for the pain
caused by the bites and stings of insects.

437
00:30:07.311 --> 00:30:10.541
From the simple ouch
of the western honeybee

438
00:30:10.566 --> 00:30:15.278
to the spray-and-pray
of the Latin American bullet ant

439
00:30:16.113 --> 00:30:19.575
that you can see primed
and ready in that box on the table.

440
00:30:20.241 --> 00:30:23.202
Spray-and-pray is short
for "spray in your pants

441
00:30:23.996 --> 00:30:27.141
and pray for the merciful release
of death."

442
00:30:27.164 --> 00:30:28.458
Excuse me, sir,

443
00:30:29.375 --> 00:30:31.229
will you just grab that bag
for me quickly?

444
00:30:31.252 --> 00:30:33.355
I promise,
this is just a big misunderstanding...

445
00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.693
Normally, we like to start slow
and build our way up.

446
00:30:37.718 --> 00:30:40.386
But you are special,

447
00:30:41.054 --> 00:30:46.602
so we begin with the murder hornet.

448
00:30:47.685 --> 00:30:49.605
Shit. Shit.

449
00:30:50.439 --> 00:30:54.210
Unless, of course,
you want to reveal the passcode.

450
00:30:54.233 --> 00:30:57.005
I don't know any passcode!
I'm telling you, you have the wrong guy.

451
00:30:57.028 --> 00:30:58.131
My name is Cole Turner.

452
00:30:58.154 --> 00:31:00.048
Just look at the passport.
It's right there in the bag.

453
00:31:00.073 --> 00:31:03.660
That's just great.
This is going to be fun.

454
00:31:04.702 --> 00:31:07.140
For me, not for you.

455
00:31:07.163 --> 00:31:09.916
Holy shit. Holy shit. Wait, wait...

456
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.251
God. Shit! Shit!

457
00:31:19.092 --> 00:31:20.384
You.

458
00:31:27.643 --> 00:31:28.827
Can you walk?

459
00:31:28.852 --> 00:31:31.480
- What?
- Can you walk, Cole?

460
00:31:33.022 --> 00:31:34.022
Sadie.

461
00:31:37.736 --> 00:31:41.949
Head down, mouth closed.
Follow me before anyone sounds the alarm.

462
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:48.138
- Know how to use a gun?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But...

463
00:31:48.163 --> 00:31:52.792
Shoot anyone who's not me.
Stay on my six. Let's go.

464
00:31:56.797 --> 00:31:58.548
Sadie. Geez.

465
00:31:59.842 --> 00:32:02.362
Sadie, what the hell is going on?
Who are these people?

466
00:32:02.385 --> 00:32:04.113
Bad guys.

467
00:32:04.136 --> 00:32:06.865
They set a trap for one of our agents,
and you fell into it.

468
00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.285
Agents. Art agents?

469
00:32:09.308 --> 00:32:11.103
- Over here.
- Down!

470
00:32:13.939 --> 00:32:16.232
Not an art agent. Got it.

471
00:32:18.359 --> 00:32:21.613
Sorry, there's a lot going on.
Plus those guys drugged me.

472
00:32:23.615 --> 00:32:24.675
Who are you?

473
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.244
CIA. At least,
until they find out about this fiasco.

474
00:32:29.162 --> 00:32:30.580
Keep moving.

475
00:32:32.708 --> 00:32:34.792
My God, you're a spy!

476
00:32:37.128 --> 00:32:38.797
Do you actually know where you're going?

477
00:32:42.092 --> 00:32:43.384
Get down!

478
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.681
Behind you!

479
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.560
You hurt?

480
00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.150
No, it's the most amazing thing I've...

481
00:32:59.609 --> 00:33:02.881
I'm so confused.
They kept asking me about the Taxman.

482
00:33:02.904 --> 00:33:06.384
- They asked you about the Taxman?
- No, they think I am a Taxman.

483
00:33:06.407 --> 00:33:08.510
They think you're the Taxman?

484
00:33:08.535 --> 00:33:10.846
That the Taxman would actually fall
for that lazy trap?

485
00:33:10.871 --> 00:33:13.207
They caught the Taxman, and it's you?

486
00:33:18.002 --> 00:33:19.630
- You're the Taxman!
- Oh, my God.

487
00:33:20.172 --> 00:33:21.339
Oh, my God!

488
00:33:22.173 --> 00:33:23.549
All right. Check down here.

489
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.304
Freeze!

490
00:33:39.023 --> 00:33:40.483
Shoot him!

491
00:33:41.442 --> 00:33:42.670
- Hey, hey!
- Shoot him!

492
00:33:42.693 --> 00:33:44.195
Just stick 'em up.

493
00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:51.596
You said you could shoot!

494
00:33:51.619 --> 00:33:53.497
At tin cans, not people.

495
00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.709
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

496
00:34:00.878 --> 00:34:01.922
Here.

497
00:34:02.798 --> 00:34:04.007
There! Go!

498
00:34:06.926 --> 00:34:08.135
- Move! Move!
- Where they at?

499
00:34:11.097 --> 00:34:13.034
Art curator, my ass.

500
00:34:13.057 --> 00:34:17.204
I thought you were different too.
Sweet, fun, low-maintenance.

501
00:34:17.228 --> 00:34:19.815
I can't believe I was gonna call you
when I got back.

502
00:34:22.442 --> 00:34:23.860
Cover me.

503
00:34:38.916 --> 00:34:39.918
Cole.

504
00:34:44.965 --> 00:34:47.050
Were you really gonna call me
when you got back?

505
00:34:49.094 --> 00:34:52.739
Yes, until you texted me 11 times
in two days.

506
00:34:52.764 --> 00:34:56.393
- Seven. Emoji stuff doesn't count.
- Yes, it does.

507
00:34:57.018 --> 00:34:59.313
Emoji stuff counts. Move.

508
00:35:24.045 --> 00:35:26.340
- Come on.
- Where the hell are we?

509
00:35:42.313 --> 00:35:44.775
Jump! Cole, come on!

510
00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:52.699
- I swallowed a rock.
- Keep going!

511
00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.344
Cover me.

512
00:36:20.561 --> 00:36:21.561
Stop!

513
00:36:22.688 --> 00:36:23.688
Get off the bus.

514
00:36:37.077 --> 00:36:38.202
Come on!

515
00:36:45.626 --> 00:36:48.186
- You're never gonna make it through.
- We're not going that way.

516
00:36:56.972 --> 00:36:59.117
Do you know what you're doing?
Have you done this before?

517
00:36:59.141 --> 00:37:00.641
I'm gonna let you think yes.

518
00:37:26.083 --> 00:37:30.273
I cannot believe you got me kidnapped
and tortured all after one date.

519
00:37:30.297 --> 00:37:32.090
You're the one who flew to London.

520
00:37:43.643 --> 00:37:44.853
Holy shit!

521
00:37:50.943 --> 00:37:52.670
- You are unbelievable!
- What?

522
00:37:52.693 --> 00:37:55.465
You stalkered your way across the ocean
to find me.

523
00:37:55.489 --> 00:37:57.657
That is not cactus behavior!

524
00:38:00.369 --> 00:38:01.954
Don't use stalker as a verb.

525
00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:04.414
And it was a romantic gesture!

526
00:38:10.336 --> 00:38:11.856
I checked your records.

527
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.382
You've never even left the country.

528
00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:17.885
You checked my records?
Who's stalkering now?

529
00:39:53.273 --> 00:39:54.733
Sadie!

530
00:40:24.012 --> 00:40:25.722
Look out!

531
00:40:33.271 --> 00:40:35.625
- Choke him out.
- They usually tap.

532
00:40:35.648 --> 00:40:38.527
He's not going to tap. Just choke him out.

533
00:41:23.822 --> 00:41:25.800
Cole! Are you comfortable?

534
00:41:25.824 --> 00:41:26.909
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

535
00:42:15.248 --> 00:42:16.518
Is that what I think it is?

536
00:42:16.541 --> 00:42:18.168
It was meant to be a joke.

537
00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:21.880
It was a lot funnier
before I used it to kill a man.

538
00:42:27.094 --> 00:42:28.094
Hey.

539
00:42:29.804 --> 00:42:30.806
Time to walk.

540
00:42:36.936 --> 00:42:38.021
Great khans,

541
00:42:39.146 --> 00:42:40.983
they used to cross these lands.

542
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.235
Brutal killers.

543
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:50.199
It was said if you wanted to find one,

544
00:42:51.994 --> 00:42:53.452
you had to step over the dead.

545
00:42:53.954 --> 00:42:58.541
The Taxman has a face.
No matches in the intelligence databases.

546
00:42:59.626 --> 00:43:01.186
They must be running him off the books.

547
00:43:02.461 --> 00:43:03.463
Clever.

548
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:06.900
I've got blood on my hands.

549
00:43:06.925 --> 00:43:10.344
It's the blood of bad men.
We did what we had to.

550
00:43:11.304 --> 00:43:13.074
Is that what you tell yourself?

551
00:43:13.097 --> 00:43:14.391
You're a liar.

552
00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:17.143
I'm not the liar here.

553
00:43:18.353 --> 00:43:20.813
I told you things I've never told anyone.

554
00:43:21.648 --> 00:43:22.940
It was all true.

555
00:43:24.275 --> 00:43:25.527
Not all of it!

556
00:43:29.114 --> 00:43:31.742
Okay, one lie about my job.

557
00:43:33.034 --> 00:43:35.304
I really ate it up too, didn't I?

558
00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:37.974
Especially that sob story
about your coworker that died.

559
00:43:37.998 --> 00:43:39.208
That is low.

560
00:43:40.083 --> 00:43:43.146
That was actually true.
Her name was Elena.

561
00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:44.963
And she really died?

562
00:43:48.175 --> 00:43:49.510
I may have killed her.

563
00:43:50.552 --> 00:43:51.594
What?

564
00:43:52.846 --> 00:43:54.639
She was an enemy agent.

565
00:43:55.389 --> 00:43:56.576
She worked for these guys.

566
00:43:56.599 --> 00:43:58.161
You said she was a coworker.

567
00:43:58.184 --> 00:43:59.786
She was. In a loose sense.

568
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:01.748
See, this is what I'm talking about.

569
00:44:01.771 --> 00:44:05.210
- It's just lies and lies and more lies.
- It's not lies and more lies.

570
00:44:05.233 --> 00:44:07.420
It's the sub-lie
of the first original lie.

571
00:44:07.443 --> 00:44:09.862
- You're unbelievable.
- Hey.

572
00:44:10.864 --> 00:44:12.675
Fine, I lied about my job.

573
00:44:12.699 --> 00:44:14.427
But you lied about who you are.

574
00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:16.804
Well, excuse me for fudging a few details

575
00:44:16.827 --> 00:44:19.664
to try and impress
the most amazing woman I've ever met.

576
00:44:22.083 --> 00:44:24.603
- Please.
- Who apparently kills coworkers.

577
00:44:24.628 --> 00:44:27.713
Oh, my God!
She killed innocent people, Cole!

578
00:44:29.675 --> 00:44:31.969
Do you know what? I am done with you.

579
00:44:32.719 --> 00:44:35.429
Head down, shut your mouth
and follow my lead.

580
00:44:36.181 --> 00:44:39.159
The sooner I get rid of you,
the sooner I get back to the mission.

581
00:44:39.184 --> 00:44:40.327
Fine. You know what?

582
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:43.748
I just want to get away from you
and out of here as fast as possible.

583
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:44.666
You should.

584
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:48.335
'Cause I've tangled with these guys
before, and they are ruthless.

585
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:52.614
And now they think you're me,
so they're looking for you, Taxman.

586
00:45:02.416 --> 00:45:06.003
I'll speak with Utami. Buy us some time.

587
00:45:15.469 --> 00:45:17.364
And the passcode?

588
00:45:17.389 --> 00:45:20.117
Looks like Borislov was too slow.

589
00:45:20.141 --> 00:45:21.226
As usual.

590
00:45:22.936 --> 00:45:25.373
But I finally know
what the Taxman looks like,

591
00:45:25.396 --> 00:45:26.481
so I'll find him.

592
00:45:29.318 --> 00:45:30.693
What is this?

593
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.822
He doesn't know anything.

594
00:45:38.159 --> 00:45:42.039
We cannot afford this kind of failure.

595
00:45:46.168 --> 00:45:49.463
The game we play, it's like no other.

596
00:45:54.635 --> 00:45:56.260
If we succeed,

597
00:45:57.304 --> 00:46:00.264
we have wealth, power.

598
00:46:02.099 --> 00:46:05.454
And if we fail, we die.

599
00:46:05.478 --> 00:46:07.831
And that is only if we're lucky.

600
00:46:07.856 --> 00:46:08.981
No, please.

601
00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:13.070
- Please help me.
- No more mistakes.

602
00:46:13.862 --> 00:46:14.862
No.

603
00:46:24.164 --> 00:46:27.793
Get that photo to every bounty hunter
on the continent.

604
00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.313
One million dollars. Alive.

605
00:46:30.336 --> 00:46:32.690
He is our only access to that code.

606
00:46:32.713 --> 00:46:37.427
Anyone kills the Taxman,
that bounty moves onto their head.

607
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.461
Be right back.

608
00:47:56.215 --> 00:47:57.798
Just like your farmers' market.

609
00:47:59.384 --> 00:48:00.385
Come on.

610
00:48:04.222 --> 00:48:05.431
Where are you taking me?

611
00:48:06.099 --> 00:48:08.768
Back to your farm,
unless you screw this up.

612
00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:12.021
Stay close.

613
00:48:26.202 --> 00:48:27.204
Be cool.

614
00:48:46.097 --> 00:48:47.099
How you doing?

615
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:52.353
What? Friendly isn't cool?

616
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:56.501
Well, well, well, Sadie sunflower.

617
00:48:56.525 --> 00:48:58.485
- Marco.
- Look at you.

618
00:49:04.115 --> 00:49:05.284
Who's your friend?

619
00:49:05.992 --> 00:49:09.161
- I'm...
- He's a civilian I just recovered.

620
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:13.934
You look ravenous, mate.

621
00:49:13.958 --> 00:49:16.855
Let me put something inside you.

622
00:49:16.878 --> 00:49:17.963
Come on.

623
00:49:21.215 --> 00:49:22.759
Sit down, sit down. Come on, sit down.

624
00:49:23.677 --> 00:49:26.929
The scrap out at the caves.
I should have known that was you.

625
00:49:28.139 --> 00:49:30.726
It was the same people that stole Aztec.

626
00:49:31.643 --> 00:49:33.746
- What's Aztec?
- A biochemical weapon.

627
00:49:33.769 --> 00:49:37.625
Very nasty. Deadly enough
to wipe out the Eastern Seaboard.

628
00:49:37.648 --> 00:49:38.543
That's classified.

629
00:49:38.568 --> 00:49:39.902
They're going to sell it.

630
00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:42.547
Thank you for filling me in.

631
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:45.592
And they're using those caves
with highly paid protection.

632
00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:47.885
There's only one man
that can pull this off.

633
00:49:47.909 --> 00:49:50.762
Leveque. Disgraced French intelligence.

634
00:49:50.786 --> 00:49:53.307
Played in this sandbox
for most of the war,

635
00:49:53.331 --> 00:49:56.960
and then he went into business
for himself. Arms deals, assassinations.

636
00:49:57.543 --> 00:50:00.213
If he's your target, be careful.
He's a dangerous man.

637
00:50:01.215 --> 00:50:03.735
Anyway, mate, best chaat in town.

638
00:50:03.759 --> 00:50:05.068
Enjoy it.

639
00:50:05.092 --> 00:50:09.139
This is yours, sunflower.
Extra spicy. Just how you like it.

640
00:50:13.226 --> 00:50:17.748
So, are you two, you know, a couple?

641
00:50:17.773 --> 00:50:19.041
- Yeah.
- No.

642
00:50:19.065 --> 00:50:20.668
- Yes. Yeah.
- No.

643
00:50:20.692 --> 00:50:22.818
- It was like five months.
- A long time.

644
00:50:23.528 --> 00:50:26.090
You know, we had a lot in common.
You know, work. Not work.

645
00:50:26.114 --> 00:50:27.382
Hey, Mahmoud.

646
00:50:27.407 --> 00:50:28.824
Got it. Subtle.

647
00:50:31.994 --> 00:50:34.014
It's not that.
It's just that sometimes it's easier

648
00:50:34.039 --> 00:50:35.516
to date someone in the same profession.

649
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:36.541
Always.

650
00:50:37.208 --> 00:50:39.394
Although I wouldn't call
what we did dating.

651
00:50:39.418 --> 00:50:40.730
Please. Can we focus?

652
00:50:40.753 --> 00:50:42.148
Well, that's charming. Very cool.

653
00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:43.715
- Okay.
- Very cool.

654
00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.342
I need to find Aztec.

655
00:50:46.217 --> 00:50:49.280
And I need your guys to get Cole
back safely to America.

656
00:50:49.304 --> 00:50:52.349
- Who is he really?
- Nobody.

657
00:50:53.307 --> 00:50:54.351
He's a mistake.

658
00:50:55.393 --> 00:50:56.371
You're the mistake.

659
00:50:56.394 --> 00:50:58.021
She said she was an art curator.

660
00:50:58.981 --> 00:51:00.356
- Wait a second.
- Oh, my God.

661
00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:02.293
You said... What?

662
00:51:02.317 --> 00:51:04.753
Is he your boyfriend?

663
00:51:04.777 --> 00:51:05.672
He's very funny.

664
00:51:05.697 --> 00:51:07.130
You poor bastard.

665
00:51:07.155 --> 00:51:09.675
You thought you met a hottie, right?
Not a Mata Hari.

666
00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:12.094
But, hey, at least the no pants dance
was worth it.

667
00:51:12.119 --> 00:51:14.389
- Oh, God.
- No, it wasn't.

668
00:51:14.413 --> 00:51:15.514
Come on.

669
00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:17.432
Oh, come on. It was. It was for me.

670
00:51:17.456 --> 00:51:18.708
And I lost a hand.

671
00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:20.208
Lost it.

672
00:51:20.751 --> 00:51:22.981
- Wait. You lo...
- Yeah, gone. It's fake.

673
00:51:23.005 --> 00:51:24.398
- Touch it.
- That's because of Sadie?

674
00:51:24.422 --> 00:51:27.443
- Yeah. You can touch it.
- No. I'm okay. How?

675
00:51:27.467 --> 00:51:28.820
When Sadie and I were together,

676
00:51:28.844 --> 00:51:31.280
we took a little
romantic getaway to Myanmar.

677
00:51:31.304 --> 00:51:33.240
No. It was a mission.

678
00:51:33.264 --> 00:51:34.701
There were many positions.

679
00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:37.494
Don't know if you remember, but anyway.
Things went south.

680
00:51:37.518 --> 00:51:40.539
I got captured, and Sadie took right off.

681
00:51:40.563 --> 00:51:43.876
Turns out that's exactly
what the secret police did to me.

682
00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.336
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, don't worry about it, man.

683
00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.864
You got two hands, right,
but only one life.

684
00:51:51.699 --> 00:51:53.619
You know what I miss most, mate? Guess.

685
00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:02.311
- Yeah.
- I used to do that all the time.

686
00:52:02.335 --> 00:52:03.711
Can't do it anymore, can I?

687
00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:07.650
Sorry. You left your boyfriend
to get his hand cut off.

688
00:52:07.673 --> 00:52:09.717
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

689
00:52:10.427 --> 00:52:12.739
I'd have done the same. Mission over man.

690
00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:14.282
Right, sunflower?

691
00:52:14.306 --> 00:52:17.159
Surrounded by lunatics. Wait a minute.

692
00:52:17.184 --> 00:52:19.978
Did you come back to save me or get Aztec?

693
00:52:21.188 --> 00:52:22.873
You were a secondary objective.

694
00:52:22.898 --> 00:52:26.503
- Oh, my God.
- High-priority secondary, I'm sure.

695
00:52:26.527 --> 00:52:28.630
And look at you now, brother. Thriving.

696
00:52:28.653 --> 00:52:30.965
Every word you're saying
is making it worse.

697
00:52:30.989 --> 00:52:33.134
- Every word. I know you're trying. Just...
- Marco.

698
00:52:33.157 --> 00:52:34.719
- This guy.
- Hey.

699
00:52:34.742 --> 00:52:37.829
Are you gonna take him back home or not?

700
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:39.766
Please say yes.

701
00:52:39.791 --> 00:52:43.960
I'd really hate it if one of my limbs
comes between Sadie and a clean exit.

702
00:52:45.753 --> 00:52:48.900
Sure. Sadie survivors
have to look after each other, right?

703
00:52:48.923 --> 00:52:49.983
Thank you.

704
00:52:50.007 --> 00:52:51.485
Honestly, thank you so much.

705
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:52.653
You're welcome, babe. Kiss?

706
00:52:52.677 --> 00:52:53.762
No.

707
00:52:54.887 --> 00:52:56.032
No.

708
00:52:56.056 --> 00:52:57.306
Goodbye, Cole.

709
00:52:59.893 --> 00:53:01.811
I'm glad that you survived.

710
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.128
I just wanna be very clear.

711
00:53:09.152 --> 00:53:12.005
Do not ever contact me again.

712
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:14.782
- Okay?
- With pleasure.

713
00:53:15.534 --> 00:53:17.427
I've already forgotten your name.

714
00:53:17.452 --> 00:53:19.621
Which I'm sure by the way
is fake anyway, so...

715
00:53:24.166 --> 00:53:26.335
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it.

716
00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:29.940
She went for a normie,
but that's just lying to herself.

717
00:53:29.965 --> 00:53:31.400
- Yeah.
- Anyway, cheer up, mate.

718
00:53:31.425 --> 00:53:34.445
Stop staring at her. Stop crying.
You're safe now. Come on.

719
00:53:34.469 --> 00:53:36.322
We got a cheeky bottle-o in the back.

720
00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:38.867
On the piss, you and me get drunk,
get smashed.

721
00:53:38.891 --> 00:53:39.992
Alcohol in your mouth.

722
00:53:40.016 --> 00:53:42.936
This is my town. Nothing happens here
that I don't see coming a mile away.

723
00:53:45.105 --> 00:53:46.940
Everything but that I guess.

724
00:53:51.777 --> 00:53:54.072
Walk. Both of you.

725
00:53:57.367 --> 00:54:00.012
- Sorry about Marco.
- Stop talking before you get us killed.

726
00:54:00.036 --> 00:54:02.097
Don't worry. They want him alive.

727
00:54:02.121 --> 00:54:05.143
I don't know what your deal is,
but I'm sure they'll pay for you too.

728
00:54:05.166 --> 00:54:08.420
- They definitely will.
- Cole, shut up. Just...

729
00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.440
I'm trying to keep you alive.

730
00:54:10.463 --> 00:54:12.150
Would you rather I say
they wouldn't pay for you?

731
00:54:12.173 --> 00:54:13.985
This is so cute. Get a room.

732
00:54:14.009 --> 00:54:16.512
If it means anything, he's not the Taxman.

733
00:54:17.012 --> 00:54:19.949
Yeah, and I'm not the Grandson of Sam.

734
00:54:19.972 --> 00:54:23.684
Huh? Like the Son of Sam,
the serial killer, but next gen.

735
00:54:24.436 --> 00:54:25.896
I'm the best bounty hunter alive.

736
00:54:31.275 --> 00:54:32.360
Second best.

737
00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.320
That was very impressive.

738
00:54:37.657 --> 00:54:40.034
- Shall we?
- Yep, yep. Yep.

739
00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:43.889
You disappointed me, Taxman.
That was too easy.

740
00:54:43.914 --> 00:54:46.059
Now your lady friend's gonna die
'cause of you.

741
00:54:46.083 --> 00:54:48.728
That's funny.
Usually the other way around.

742
00:54:48.751 --> 00:54:50.230
It was you who followed me to Europe.

743
00:54:50.253 --> 00:54:51.856
Lured by your lying.

744
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.650
God, you two need to get a room.

745
00:54:53.673 --> 00:54:56.068
We did. That's what got us into this mess.

746
00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:57.469
Okay, get in the car.

747
00:55:00.389 --> 00:55:02.891
Lady drives. Taxman, you're riding middle.

748
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:07.436
Scooch, scooch.

749
00:55:09.231 --> 00:55:11.166
Well, Taxman it up.

750
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:12.818
Don't use Taxman as a verb.

751
00:55:14.987 --> 00:55:16.530
You mind telling us who you are?

752
00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.407
They call me the Leopard.

753
00:55:21.367 --> 00:55:22.804
Oh, my God.

754
00:55:22.827 --> 00:55:24.389
Called him the Leopard.

755
00:55:24.413 --> 00:55:27.724
But even leopards get killed by lions,

756
00:55:27.748 --> 00:55:30.293
hyenas, lightning.

757
00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:32.795
Get him out.

758
00:55:38.552 --> 00:55:39.719
And drive.

759
00:55:45.266 --> 00:55:46.268
And who are you?

760
00:55:49.771 --> 00:55:51.731
God. The Bounty Hunter.

761
00:55:52.523 --> 00:55:55.670
Wow. You guys have really good names
in your world.

762
00:55:55.693 --> 00:55:59.197
It's like the WWE, but scarier.

763
00:56:03.159 --> 00:56:07.079
One twist of this ring will send
50,000 volts through your sorry ass.

764
00:56:08.373 --> 00:56:11.311
- Make you wish you were dead.
- Too late.

765
00:56:11.335 --> 00:56:13.938
This is great. Thank you for this.

766
00:56:13.961 --> 00:56:16.231
- Huh?
- No, I was just thinking how happy I am

767
00:56:16.255 --> 00:56:18.775
to have an electrified hockey puck
stuck to my neck with what,

768
00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.945
- 50,000 volts ready to go into...
- I can't take this.

769
00:56:20.969 --> 00:56:22.614
- Volts into my...
- You really need to shut up.

770
00:56:22.637 --> 00:56:23.532
Wow.

771
00:56:23.556 --> 00:56:25.516
You two should get a room.

772
00:56:27.391 --> 00:56:28.827
You know what? Stop.

773
00:56:28.851 --> 00:56:30.079
Pull over here.

774
00:56:30.103 --> 00:56:31.230
My car is better.

775
00:56:40.697 --> 00:56:42.759
Look, I don't mean to
shake your confidence, God,

776
00:56:42.782 --> 00:56:44.385
but the last two guys didn't make it.

777
00:56:44.409 --> 00:56:45.911
My confidence doesn't shake.

778
00:56:46.536 --> 00:56:50.081
I spent years conditioning myself
to attuning my sense...

779
00:56:55.628 --> 00:56:58.090
Got you, suckers.

780
00:57:11.978 --> 00:57:15.481
If you're collecting the bounty,
where are they taking delivery?

781
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:27.387
Listen, I'll stash you someplace safe.

782
00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:30.764
If I don't come back for you,
an extraction team will.

783
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:34.393
So you're really gonna raid a plane
full of armed goons by yourself?

784
00:57:34.418 --> 00:57:37.795
I have to find Aztec. It's my only play.

785
00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:39.755
Wow.

786
00:57:45.846 --> 00:57:49.701
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry about Marco.

787
00:57:49.724 --> 00:57:51.351
God. Seriously?

788
00:57:52.186 --> 00:57:55.498
You know, I'm trying to connect
about a person that just died.

789
00:57:55.521 --> 00:57:57.208
Someone you knew well.

790
00:57:57.231 --> 00:57:59.501
Are you capable of that,
or is that only on first dates?

791
00:57:59.525 --> 00:58:03.297
The rest of the time, it's just
chemical weapons and passcodes

792
00:58:03.322 --> 00:58:04.798
and bullets and death.

793
00:58:04.822 --> 00:58:07.594
Wait, what passcodes?
What do you mean about passcodes?

794
00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:12.414
The bug guy in the cave
kept asking me about passcodes.

795
00:58:13.206 --> 00:58:14.498
Jesus!

796
00:58:16.126 --> 00:58:18.478
- He thinks I have the passcode?
- Yeah.

797
00:58:18.503 --> 00:58:20.148
And you're telling me this now?

798
00:58:20.172 --> 00:58:21.440
I'm sorry.

799
00:58:21.465 --> 00:58:24.027
I was slightly drugged and kidnapped
at the time.

800
00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:24.945
Unbelievable.

801
00:58:24.969 --> 00:58:27.655
Also, in case you forgot, I'm a farmer.

802
00:58:27.679 --> 00:58:29.407
I'm not a super spy.

803
00:58:29.431 --> 00:58:32.952
Why didn't you just ask me
what the torturer was torturing me about?

804
00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:34.329
You are unbelievable!

805
00:58:34.353 --> 00:58:36.121
What? What?

806
00:58:36.146 --> 00:58:37.916
What are the passcodes?

807
00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.858
The least you could do is tell me
what I almost died for.

808
00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:48.550
Aztec is inside a high-security case
that cannot be opened without a passcode.

809
00:58:48.574 --> 00:58:50.969
Elena figured out the DNA encryption.

810
00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:52.347
What do you mean, DNA encryption?

811
00:58:52.371 --> 00:58:55.934
The passcode is the entire genetic
sequence of a living organism.

812
00:58:55.958 --> 00:58:58.686
- Insanely long and unique.
- Wow.

813
00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:01.271
I got to Elena
before she could upload it to Leveque.

814
00:59:01.295 --> 00:59:03.023
So they think you have the passcode?

815
00:59:03.047 --> 00:59:06.009
But I don't because she destroyed it.

816
00:59:08.594 --> 00:59:10.155
But if Leveque
is trying to get it from me,

817
00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:12.139
that means he doesn't have it either.

818
00:59:12.641 --> 00:59:15.119
Which means he can't
hand the weapon over to his buyers.

819
00:59:15.143 --> 00:59:17.621
- Which means...
- He still has Aztec.

820
00:59:17.646 --> 00:59:19.998
Which means change of plans.

821
00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:21.333
Do you trust me?

822
00:59:21.358 --> 00:59:23.193
Is that a fucking joke?

823
00:59:23.735 --> 00:59:25.278
Thank you for your honesty.

824
00:59:38.458 --> 00:59:40.353
You're a f... I cannot believe...

825
00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:43.130
'Cause I'm the taxman

826
00:59:44.797 --> 00:59:48.885
Yeah, I'm the taxman

827
00:59:50.469 --> 00:59:53.407
- Get it?
- The song? Very funny.

828
00:59:53.431 --> 00:59:56.518
You left an impressive trail of blood
bringing us our friend.

829
00:59:57.936 --> 01:00:00.164
- Well done.
- Thanks.

830
01:00:00.188 --> 01:00:01.815
But I don't get paid in compliments.

831
01:00:04.108 --> 01:00:06.527
You'll get your money, bounty hunter.

832
01:00:14.536 --> 01:00:16.163
So you're the Taxman.

833
01:00:16.996 --> 01:00:19.248
CIA's golden boy.

834
01:00:21.376 --> 01:00:25.088
Your pseudonym has generated
as much fun as you have.

835
01:00:25.713 --> 01:00:26.965
But I know you.

836
01:00:31.637 --> 01:00:34.181
I know you because I was you.

837
01:00:35.306 --> 01:00:36.807
Disposable.

838
01:00:37.476 --> 01:00:41.271
Except one day, I found myself

839
01:00:42.396 --> 01:00:46.400
bleeding out in a ditch
on the edge of Kabul.

840
01:00:51.697 --> 01:00:53.992
There was trash everywhere.

841
01:00:54.701 --> 01:00:58.413
And then suddenly, I got clarity.

842
01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:02.208
I had given them everything

843
01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.670
and sacrificed everything.

844
01:01:07.422 --> 01:01:09.842
It is a waste of life.

845
01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:13.262
And what are we?

846
01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:17.099
Instruments.

847
01:01:18.724 --> 01:01:20.101
Expendable.

848
01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:23.355
We deserve better.

849
01:01:35.157 --> 01:01:39.413
Tell me the passcode and walk away.

850
01:01:41.789 --> 01:01:42.875
If you don't...

851
01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:46.210
well, we both know how that will go.

852
01:01:46.878 --> 01:01:48.463
I will get what I want...

853
01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:52.509
and you will die anyway.

854
01:01:53.467 --> 01:01:54.969
For nothing.

855
01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:00.492
I swear to God,
I don't know what the passcode is.

856
01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:01.809
I'm not even the Taxman.

857
01:02:02.603 --> 01:02:03.603
Shut up.

858
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:07.315
Can we get back to business?

859
01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:09.775
Is that my money?

860
01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:15.592
Your payment will be wired soon.

861
01:02:15.615 --> 01:02:18.427
Rumor has it
you stole a weapon you can't use,

862
01:02:18.452 --> 01:02:20.137
so you're overextended.

863
01:02:20.161 --> 01:02:23.391
And now you want me to work on what?
Credit?

864
01:02:23.414 --> 01:02:25.309
No, no.

865
01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:26.418
Cash.

866
01:02:27.293 --> 01:02:30.398
And until I get it,
he doesn't leave my sight.

867
01:02:30.422 --> 01:02:32.298
Or we just kill you.

868
01:02:35.344 --> 01:02:38.655
And make your boss
the guy who offers big paydays

869
01:02:38.679 --> 01:02:40.349
and kills anyone who delivers?

870
01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:42.869
Let me guess.

871
01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:45.746
This is the idiot
who lost him to begin with.

872
01:02:45.771 --> 01:02:48.106
You'll get your cash when you land.

873
01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:53.110
She called you an idiot.

874
01:02:53.695 --> 01:02:54.547
Yeah.

875
01:02:54.572 --> 01:02:55.947
To your face.

876
01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:59.576
Kill her when you touch down.

877
01:03:01.036 --> 01:03:02.871
Get that passcode.

878
01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:06.059
I expect that to be open
next time I see you.

879
01:03:06.083 --> 01:03:07.166
You're not coming?

880
01:03:09.795 --> 01:03:12.922
If anything should go wrong
when you open that case...

881
01:03:16.467 --> 01:03:18.530
everyone on board dies.

882
01:03:18.554 --> 01:03:19.804
No pressure.

883
01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.266
Yes, sir.

884
01:03:37.364 --> 01:03:39.699
We're looking for a genetic sequence.

885
01:03:40.742 --> 01:03:42.202
Do you know what "genetic" means?

886
01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:52.420
That's a cactus.

887
01:03:55.507 --> 01:03:56.757
Thirsty?

888
01:04:08.228 --> 01:04:09.746
- Be smart.
- Sociopath.

889
01:04:09.771 --> 01:04:11.456
I'm not a sociopath.

890
01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:13.817
You know who says that a lot? Sociopaths.

891
01:04:19.405 --> 01:04:23.385
I have dated some crazies in my day,
but you are certifiable.

892
01:04:23.409 --> 01:04:25.746
This is bigger than you and me.

893
01:04:26.538 --> 01:04:28.039
And my plan worked.

894
01:04:28.748 --> 01:04:29.726
Better than I imagined.

895
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:30.833
Really?

896
01:04:31.376 --> 01:04:33.353
Did you imagine
I'd make it out of this alive?

897
01:04:33.378 --> 01:04:34.838
We found Aztec.

898
01:04:39.217 --> 01:04:41.762
As soon as we land,
we'll take these guys down.

899
01:04:42.554 --> 01:04:43.572
We'll be safe.

900
01:04:43.597 --> 01:04:45.891
The world will be safe. Everybody wins.

901
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:55.293
What's all this?

902
01:04:55.317 --> 01:04:56.400
What's...

903
01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.320
all this?

904
01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:08.621
I would expect more discretion

905
01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:11.166
from the Taxman.

906
01:05:11.958 --> 01:05:13.210
So would I.

907
01:05:14.878 --> 01:05:16.380
So what are you really?

908
01:05:17.338 --> 01:05:18.715
Hired help?

909
01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:20.693
Or just the girlfriend?

910
01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:22.987
Believe me, she's not girlfriend material.

911
01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:24.137
You know, I don't care.

912
01:05:25.347 --> 01:05:26.974
You die either way.

913
01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:29.851
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait. Wait.

914
01:05:30.936 --> 01:05:32.621
Who's the idiot now?

915
01:05:32.646 --> 01:05:34.063
I have the passcode.

916
01:05:35.523 --> 01:05:37.150
Bullshit.

917
01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:38.902
He doesn't have it.

918
01:05:39.485 --> 01:05:40.487
I do.

919
01:05:41.655 --> 01:05:42.989
Really?

920
01:05:43.824 --> 01:05:44.907
So we can kill him.

921
01:05:46.827 --> 01:05:48.887
Hey! Wait. Okay. Wait.

922
01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:50.831
The passcode. Now!

923
01:05:52.331 --> 01:05:54.418
Sure. It's in my pocket.

924
01:05:58.045 --> 01:05:59.047
We're good.

925
01:06:05.721 --> 01:06:06.780
Really?

926
01:06:06.804 --> 01:06:07.889
Open it.

927
01:06:38.253 --> 01:06:39.338
Shit!

928
01:06:45.344 --> 01:06:47.989
I can't believe you took a picture of me
while I was sleeping!

929
01:06:48.012 --> 01:06:49.449
Not of you, of us!

930
01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.932
I knew you were a creep!

931
01:06:55.228 --> 01:06:56.206
I'm not a creep!

932
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:58.398
You know who says that a lot? Creeps!

933
01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:08.802
Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.

934
01:08:09.969 --> 01:08:11.114
Oh, my God.

935
01:08:11.137 --> 01:08:12.806
Take the case and go.

936
01:08:14.599 --> 01:08:17.036
- There is a parachute.
- What about you?

937
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.787
Mission over man.

938
01:08:18.811 --> 01:08:22.041
No. No. I gotta stop this bleeding first.
You're losing a lot of blood.

939
01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.167
- Just go, Cole.
- I gotta find...

940
01:08:23.192 --> 01:08:25.112
- Cole, go! Go!
- Sadie, I'm telling you right...

941
01:08:26.987 --> 01:08:28.029
Get out of here.

942
01:08:35.287 --> 01:08:36.287
Hey!

943
01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:45.963
Get out of the way, you idiot.

944
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:49.444
What are you doing?

945
01:08:49.467 --> 01:08:50.636
I have no idea.

946
01:09:19.539 --> 01:09:20.666
Sadie?

947
01:09:22.167 --> 01:09:23.667
God.

948
01:09:28.506 --> 01:09:29.675
I told you to go.

949
01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:33.636
I did.

950
01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.514
I just took you with me.

951
01:09:36.097 --> 01:09:37.199
How long was I out?

952
01:09:37.224 --> 01:09:38.600
A while.

953
01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:42.563
Looks like you got creative
with the parachute.

954
01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:45.649
I had a lot of nervous energy.

955
01:09:53.238 --> 01:09:54.240
You got it.

956
01:09:54.908 --> 01:09:55.993
Yeah. Yeah.

957
01:09:56.493 --> 01:09:57.720
You got it.

958
01:09:57.743 --> 01:09:59.746
- You got Aztec.
- Yeah.

959
01:10:01.456 --> 01:10:03.100
- Wait. Take it easy.
- I mean, do you have a...

960
01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:04.667
You lost a lot of blood.

961
01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.171
It was really gross.

962
01:10:10.256 --> 01:10:12.050
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

963
01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.761
Thank you.

964
01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:16.512
You're welcome.

965
01:10:37.074 --> 01:10:39.536
Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon.

966
01:10:41.121 --> 01:10:42.181
Hello?

967
01:10:42.206 --> 01:10:44.082
Leveque, things didn't go as planned.

968
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.476
The girl sprung the Taxman.

969
01:10:46.501 --> 01:10:49.003
How many times can you lose one man?

970
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:51.190
Listen carefully.

971
01:10:51.215 --> 01:10:54.359
If we do not deliver
an operational weapon in 48 hours,

972
01:10:54.384 --> 01:10:55.886
our buyers will kill us all.

973
01:10:56.677 --> 01:10:58.305
Now, you find the Taxman,

974
01:10:59.389 --> 01:11:03.351
or they will not have the chance
because I will kill you myself.

975
01:11:07.064 --> 01:11:09.358
Boss. We have a sighting of the parachute.

976
01:11:11.193 --> 01:11:12.360
Good.

977
01:11:22.537 --> 01:11:25.332
You know,
I think, depending on your strength,

978
01:11:26.166 --> 01:11:28.377
we should consider maybe hiking
out of here tomorrow.

979
01:11:28.961 --> 01:11:30.212
Depending on your strength.

980
01:11:33.923 --> 01:11:36.551
You have to tell me. What is this gunk?

981
01:11:37.344 --> 01:11:39.655
It's periwinkle and gavilana.

982
01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.242
I found it up the beach,
smashed it up and put it in there

983
01:11:42.265 --> 01:11:44.768
to stop the bleeding
and fight the infection.

984
01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:48.063
- How did you know how to do that?
- I read about it.

985
01:11:49.064 --> 01:11:52.734
Throughout history, every culture has
their own knowledge of the crops they grow

986
01:11:53.277 --> 01:11:55.737
for food or clothing, medicine.

987
01:11:57.405 --> 01:12:00.533
I just don't get why you never left
the country.

988
01:12:01.618 --> 01:12:03.011
- Here we go.
- What? I'm serious.

989
01:12:03.036 --> 01:12:05.097
You're clearly interested in the world.

990
01:12:05.122 --> 01:12:10.185
I wanted to travel. I really did.
I thought I was gonna after I graduated.

991
01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:12.628
You know, research the book.
Then my dad got hurt...

992
01:12:15.756 --> 01:12:16.757
just went home.

993
01:12:18.594 --> 01:12:19.886
He never recovered?

994
01:12:20.679 --> 01:12:22.323
No, he did. He's good now.

995
01:12:22.346 --> 01:12:24.701
But you know, he's getting old.

996
01:12:24.725 --> 01:12:27.828
And you know,
we got to keep production high to compete,

997
01:12:27.853 --> 01:12:29.747
and business is changing.

998
01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:30.855
Anyway...

999
01:12:32.524 --> 01:12:33.567
They need me there.

1000
01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:35.652
Do they?

1001
01:12:40.364 --> 01:12:42.635
What about you? Your mom must be proud.

1002
01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:45.494
Daughter's a CIA agent. Right?

1003
01:12:47.956 --> 01:12:49.332
I'd like to think she'd be.

1004
01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:54.587
My mom died when I was very young.

1005
01:12:55.463 --> 01:12:58.150
- God, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- It's okay.

1006
01:12:58.175 --> 01:13:01.302
I promise. It happened so long ago.

1007
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:06.015
You know, and then after she died,
I found the army.

1008
01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:10.395
You know,
somewhere where I could put my focus.

1009
01:13:10.979 --> 01:13:14.649
And then the agency, they gave me purpose.

1010
01:13:17.485 --> 01:13:21.280
Our struggles make us stronger. Right?

1011
01:13:23.408 --> 01:13:24.576
Any other family?

1012
01:13:26.537 --> 01:13:29.413
In my line of work,
it's better being alone.

1013
01:13:30.791 --> 01:13:31.792
Is it?

1014
01:13:37.547 --> 01:13:40.759
For what it's worth, I think
that any parent would be very proud...

1015
01:13:42.176 --> 01:13:43.345
of you.

1016
01:13:47.431 --> 01:13:48.534
You know what?

1017
01:13:48.559 --> 01:13:52.604
I just can't believe that that little shit
is still in one piece.

1018
01:13:53.438 --> 01:13:55.731
Maybe you can keep
a cactus alive after all.

1019
01:13:56.984 --> 01:13:57.984
Maybe.

1020
01:14:09.328 --> 01:14:10.747
I'm sorry about the selfie.

1021
01:14:11.456 --> 01:14:13.059
I'm sorry about the gag.

1022
01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:14.519
Call it even?

1023
01:14:14.542 --> 01:14:15.627
Deal.

1024
01:14:59.671 --> 01:15:00.713
Run!

1025
01:15:03.175 --> 01:15:06.845
Get me the Taxman alive, kill the girl,
and I'll get Aztec.

1026
01:15:18.606 --> 01:15:19.733
Move! Move!

1027
01:15:21.693 --> 01:15:22.819
There she is.

1028
01:15:32.162 --> 01:15:34.724
Attention.
This is the United States Marines.

1029
01:15:34.747 --> 01:15:38.210
Safety your weapons
and drop them on the ground.

1030
01:15:54.309 --> 01:15:55.644
Damn it.

1031
01:16:23.881 --> 01:16:25.131
Where's the case?

1032
01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.931
Agent Rhodes. It's time to go home.

1033
01:16:35.684 --> 01:16:37.603
We're fine. Thanks.

1034
01:16:39.188 --> 01:16:40.314
Let's go.

1035
01:16:48.779 --> 01:16:51.426
- That's not too tight on you now, is it?
- No.

1036
01:16:51.449 --> 01:16:53.261
Okay. Just wanna make sure.

1037
01:16:53.284 --> 01:16:54.411
Yeah, that's good.

1038
01:16:56.622 --> 01:16:58.432
A polygraph, Jackson?

1039
01:16:58.457 --> 01:17:01.251
Are you really
this desperate to jump ahead of me?

1040
01:17:03.045 --> 01:17:04.855
I'm just doing my job, Rhodes.

1041
01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.318
No, if you were doing your job,
you'd be out there looking for Aztec.

1042
01:17:08.341 --> 01:17:10.360
If you had done yours,
we never would have lost it.

1043
01:17:10.385 --> 01:17:13.471
Well, it wasn't her fault.
She was just trying to save me.

1044
01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:17.391
Of course.

1045
01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:20.872
The boyfriend,
accidentally along for the ride.

1046
01:17:20.895 --> 01:17:23.416
Didn't it ever occur to you
that he could be a foreign asset,

1047
01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:24.800
trying to compromise your mission?

1048
01:17:25.692 --> 01:17:31.090
Yeah. Six-foot honeypot sent to kiss
and nibble the secrets right out of you.

1049
01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:33.592
Patti, just watch the machine, please.

1050
01:17:33.617 --> 01:17:35.427
Right. Sorry.

1051
01:17:35.452 --> 01:17:40.164
We both know you checked him out.
He's a civilian, and he's clean.

1052
01:17:41.332 --> 01:17:42.726
Some civilian.

1053
01:17:42.751 --> 01:17:47.564
Because you chose his life over thousands,
if Aztec is ever deployed.

1054
01:17:47.588 --> 01:17:50.050
I let my emotions cloud my judgment.

1055
01:17:52.176 --> 01:17:53.177
Wait a minute.

1056
01:17:55.847 --> 01:18:00.060
Are you saying you think
it was a mistake to save my life?

1057
01:18:02.813 --> 01:18:03.813
Yes.

1058
01:18:10.737 --> 01:18:11.738
That's great.

1059
01:18:12.905 --> 01:18:14.240
That's great.

1060
01:18:14.824 --> 01:18:18.762
Cole, I'm sorry, but they're right.
One life compared to thousands.

1061
01:18:18.787 --> 01:18:21.515
Yeah, no, I get it.
Mission over man justifies everything.

1062
01:18:21.539 --> 01:18:23.935
Marco's hand,
using me as bait at the airstrip.

1063
01:18:23.958 --> 01:18:25.561
- I get it.
- You used him as bait?

1064
01:18:25.586 --> 01:18:26.479
- Yes.
- No.

1065
01:18:26.503 --> 01:18:27.939
Well...

1066
01:18:27.962 --> 01:18:30.692
Marco was right about you.
You should date someone just like him.

1067
01:18:30.716 --> 01:18:33.235
Completely cut off
from emotional connection

1068
01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:34.819
- and not afraid to lose a limb.
- What?

1069
01:18:35.345 --> 01:18:37.764
You know what?
Marco was right, but not about that.

1070
01:18:38.515 --> 01:18:42.287
We only have one life,
and you are too afraid to live it.

1071
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:43.579
Says the one-handed dead guy.

1072
01:18:43.604 --> 01:18:44.706
What's happening?

1073
01:18:44.729 --> 01:18:46.875
Cole, you went to your parents' house
to help them.

1074
01:18:46.899 --> 01:18:48.877
But I don't think they need you anymore.

1075
01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:50.962
I think
they're just an excuse to avoid life.

1076
01:18:50.985 --> 01:18:52.171
Look who's talking.

1077
01:18:52.195 --> 01:18:56.842
Your job, the duty, the sacrifice,
that's your excuse to keep people out.

1078
01:18:56.867 --> 01:18:58.552
I think you're afraid
to get close to people.

1079
01:18:58.577 --> 01:18:59.929
'Cause if you do, you might lose them.

1080
01:18:59.953 --> 01:19:01.512
- Just like you lost your mother.
- Hey!

1081
01:19:02.372 --> 01:19:04.832
You don't talk about her!

1082
01:19:09.003 --> 01:19:10.756
And I'm not afraid of anything.

1083
01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:15.135
You two need to get a room.

1084
01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.363
- Oh, my God.
- Patti,

1085
01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:18.780
he's not even hooked up to the machine.

1086
01:19:18.805 --> 01:19:22.618
I'm sorry. But, you guys,
the sexual tension in the room is just...

1087
01:19:22.643 --> 01:19:23.976
The boss wants to see you.

1088
01:19:31.818 --> 01:19:33.779
So much for starting with a houseplant.

1089
01:19:37.032 --> 01:19:38.824
I know she pulled you into this...

1090
01:19:41.203 --> 01:19:42.203
but...

1091
01:19:44.957 --> 01:19:46.207
you're still in deep shit.

1092
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.394
You're facing prosecution.

1093
01:19:48.417 --> 01:19:50.979
For what? Visiting a girl in London?

1094
01:19:51.003 --> 01:19:52.314
Why are you protecting her?

1095
01:19:52.338 --> 01:19:55.944
I know this looks bad. I can fix it.

1096
01:19:55.967 --> 01:19:57.403
We can still get Leveque.

1097
01:19:57.426 --> 01:20:00.280
You were always my favorite, Sadie.

1098
01:20:00.305 --> 01:20:03.391
But you going rogue,
there's nothing I can do.

1099
01:20:03.975 --> 01:20:04.869
What do you mean?

1100
01:20:04.894 --> 01:20:07.372
She didn't lose Aztec, did she?

1101
01:20:07.395 --> 01:20:09.791
No, no, no, no, no.
She's working an angle.

1102
01:20:09.814 --> 01:20:11.608
- No. No.
- Looking to cash in.

1103
01:20:13.609 --> 01:20:14.944
Sadie would never do that.

1104
01:20:17.322 --> 01:20:20.426
You let Aztec
get into the hands of a known threat.

1105
01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:22.761
You're suspended,
pending a full investigation,

1106
01:20:22.786 --> 01:20:24.680
but you know how these things go.

1107
01:20:24.704 --> 01:20:27.916
You'll be lucky to have a job
at all when it's done.

1108
01:20:30.668 --> 01:20:32.396
Look at what she does.

1109
01:20:32.421 --> 01:20:34.231
And this is just the last six months.

1110
01:20:34.256 --> 01:20:36.591
She's a liar and a killer, Cole.

1111
01:20:37.426 --> 01:20:38.926
Is that someone you want to protect?

1112
01:20:41.512 --> 01:20:42.805
Take home to Mom?

1113
01:20:48.729 --> 01:20:49.979
Oh, my God.

1114
01:20:53.649 --> 01:20:56.628
What am I looking at? A houseplant?

1115
01:20:56.653 --> 01:20:59.864
Well, it's not a houseplant.
That's an amaranth. A crop.

1116
01:21:01.908 --> 01:21:05.054
Farmed in the Americas
for thousands of years, mostly for food,

1117
01:21:05.078 --> 01:21:08.457
but often used in rituals by the Aztecs.

1118
01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:14.521
Oh, my God. The plant wasn't hers.
She took it from Horvath, the scientist.

1119
01:21:14.546 --> 01:21:17.632
He was obsessed with the Aztecs' use
of human sacrifice.

1120
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:21.529
The genetic sequence
of that amaranth is the passcode.

1121
01:21:21.552 --> 01:21:23.072
I'll be damned.

1122
01:21:23.095 --> 01:21:26.265
I want that plant retrieved
from Elena's apartment now.

1123
01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:30.747
You know, we can use this to lure
in Leveque. We get a message to him.

1124
01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:33.707
"The Taxman is ready
to sell the passcode."

1125
01:21:33.731 --> 01:21:34.833
He'll never go for it.

1126
01:21:34.858 --> 01:21:36.902
Unless we bait the hook.

1127
01:21:38.069 --> 01:21:40.631
The passcode is divided
into four segments.

1128
01:21:40.655 --> 01:21:42.050
Send Leveque the first.

1129
01:21:42.073 --> 01:21:45.552
What? Give him part of the key?
That's insane.

1130
01:21:45.577 --> 01:21:48.663
Exactly. The agency would never allow it.

1131
01:21:49.331 --> 01:21:53.835
So if the Taxman is doing it, that means
he went rogue and the offer is real.

1132
01:21:55.462 --> 01:21:57.463
Leveque is desperate. He'll bite.

1133
01:22:00.175 --> 01:22:03.679
That means we're gonna need the Taxman.

1134
01:22:07.181 --> 01:22:11.246
Me? No, no, no way.

1135
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:13.581
It's only for appearances.
He won't even get near you.

1136
01:22:13.604 --> 01:22:17.292
Well, then what do you need me for?
Use a dummy. Put Jackson in a disguise.

1137
01:22:17.317 --> 01:22:18.545
That's a great idea.

1138
01:22:18.569 --> 01:22:22.506
Mr. Turner, I know you don't want
to do this, but I also know that you will.

1139
01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:25.926
As long as Leveque thinks
you're the Taxman, you're in danger.

1140
01:22:25.951 --> 01:22:29.764
Well, then put me in protective custody.
Hide me just until you find the guy.

1141
01:22:29.787 --> 01:22:31.206
What about your family?

1142
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.377
- What about my family?
- Guys like Leveque, they never stop.

1143
01:22:36.962 --> 01:22:39.481
The only way
to guarantee your family's safety

1144
01:22:39.506 --> 01:22:41.132
is to take him off the board.

1145
01:22:44.595 --> 01:22:45.636
No, no, no.

1146
01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:50.559
Hey, Cole. Cole, it's too dangerous.

1147
01:22:51.851 --> 01:22:53.020
They're using you.

1148
01:22:53.686 --> 01:22:56.541
Well, that's funny because he just said
the same thing about you.

1149
01:22:56.564 --> 01:22:59.502
Remind me, which one of you
can't stop risking my life?

1150
01:22:59.525 --> 01:23:02.863
I know you're angry,
but this is a mistake.

1151
01:23:04.113 --> 01:23:06.490
Protecting the people you love
is never a mistake.

1152
01:23:08.118 --> 01:23:10.996
Maybe one day you'll care enough
about someone to understand that.

1153
01:23:13.707 --> 01:23:14.832
Rhodes.

1154
01:23:23.216 --> 01:23:25.176
Come on, you have to let me run this.

1155
01:23:25.761 --> 01:23:27.822
I know more about Leveque's operation
than anyone.

1156
01:23:27.845 --> 01:23:30.681
Go home, Sadie. And stay there.

1157
01:23:49.158 --> 01:23:50.136
What do you think?

1158
01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:52.496
What do I think? I think it is a trap.

1159
01:23:54.372 --> 01:23:55.373
Test it.

1160
01:24:10.639 --> 01:24:11.640
It's genuine.

1161
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:14.452
Maybe it's not a trap.

1162
01:24:14.475 --> 01:24:19.398
Or maybe it is just a very good one.
Either way, what choice do we have?

1163
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:21.190
Boss.

1164
01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:28.966
Mr. Utami. Pleasure to see you again.

1165
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:31.386
Funny. When you accepted my first payment,

1166
01:24:31.409 --> 01:24:33.930
you neglected to mention
that you didn't have the passcode.

1167
01:24:33.953 --> 01:24:38.082
We will have it soon.
Aztec will be yours as promised.

1168
01:24:47.134 --> 01:24:48.260
Mine, I believe.

1169
01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:51.512
You're meeting the Taxman?

1170
01:24:52.972 --> 01:24:54.099
We'll go together.

1171
01:24:55.809 --> 01:25:01.606
If he has the passcode, we conclude
our business. If he doesn't, I kill you.

1172
01:25:10.114 --> 01:25:12.826
Mr. Utami, one condition.

1173
01:25:13.827 --> 01:25:16.454
Whatever happens, the Taxman dies.

1174
01:25:17.456 --> 01:25:18.539
So be it.

1175
01:25:58.663 --> 01:26:00.682
Turner,
get in there and make it look good.

1176
01:26:00.707 --> 01:26:02.792
You'll be in and out in 20 minutes.

1177
01:26:07.756 --> 01:26:10.902
Stop messing with your collar. Sounds
like a goddamn thunderstorm in here.

1178
01:26:10.926 --> 01:26:13.804
Sorry, I hate suits.

1179
01:26:28.652 --> 01:26:31.654
- How many guys do you have?
- Including me? Three.

1180
01:26:32.905 --> 01:26:36.051
Three? What do you mean? Three guys total?

1181
01:26:36.076 --> 01:26:38.262
You have three guys total?
You can't do this with three guys.

1182
01:26:38.287 --> 01:26:41.807
The CIA can't operate on US soil.
We had to travel light.

1183
01:26:41.832 --> 01:26:46.020
Travel light?
What are you, backpacking through Europe?

1184
01:26:46.043 --> 01:26:49.314
You're the CIA. What does that even mean?
Travel light?

1185
01:26:49.338 --> 01:26:52.609
Calm down. Leveque's men
just need to see you in there.

1186
01:26:52.634 --> 01:26:54.362
We'll arrest him as soon as he shows.

1187
01:26:54.386 --> 01:26:55.779
You got to play the part.

1188
01:26:55.804 --> 01:27:00.391
You're not a farmer anymore. Remember?
You're the Taxman. Now, get in there.

1189
01:27:12.945 --> 01:27:14.256
Hi, welcome in.

1190
01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:15.841
Table for Mr. Taxman.

1191
01:27:15.865 --> 01:27:17.242
Yes, right this way.

1192
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:35.761
Cheers!

1193
01:27:52.402 --> 01:27:55.047
Everything will be fine.
We've got it all under control,

1194
01:27:55.072 --> 01:27:56.966
and the bad guys will never get near you.

1195
01:27:56.989 --> 01:27:58.699
Three guys.

1196
01:28:16.676 --> 01:28:17.970
They're here.

1197
01:28:28.646 --> 01:28:31.524
We got eyes on the target.
He has the weapon.

1198
01:28:32.693 --> 01:28:33.944
Let's get ready to move.

1199
01:28:40.908 --> 01:28:42.536
Jackson. What was that?

1200
01:28:43.871 --> 01:28:45.849
- Cole.
- What?

1201
01:28:45.872 --> 01:28:47.057
Get out of there.

1202
01:28:47.082 --> 01:28:50.895
Go now? Okay. Okay. Okay.

1203
01:28:50.918 --> 01:28:52.753
Does this mean we lose Leveque?

1204
01:28:53.462 --> 01:28:55.622
Jackson, what happens to my family
if you lose Leveque?

1205
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:05.850
I'm staying.

1206
01:29:17.654 --> 01:29:18.779
She's coming.

1207
01:29:20.282 --> 01:29:21.283
I know it.

1208
01:29:43.471 --> 01:29:49.520
Well, well, well, what a romantic spot
for our first official date.

1209
01:30:05.202 --> 01:30:09.163
I brought a little something special
for us to open up.

1210
01:30:12.292 --> 01:30:16.171
And some chaperone. Hope you don't mind.

1211
01:30:18.006 --> 01:30:22.344
I apologize. Yours are no longer with us.

1212
01:30:23.345 --> 01:30:25.180
It is more intimate this way, no?

1213
01:30:26.597 --> 01:30:28.225
Are you all right, Taxman?

1214
01:30:30.143 --> 01:30:32.895
I hate to think something
might ruin our night.

1215
01:30:37.859 --> 01:30:40.712
- Thank you.
- For what?

1216
01:30:40.737 --> 01:30:43.114
For helping me with my chaperones.

1217
01:30:43.948 --> 01:30:46.952
Saves me the hassle
of having to kill them myself.

1218
01:30:48.244 --> 01:30:50.037
It was my pleasure.

1219
01:30:52.498 --> 01:30:54.417
But somehow I don't believe you.

1220
01:30:55.502 --> 01:30:57.296
Well, I don't care what you believe.

1221
01:30:58.296 --> 01:31:02.527
My intention is to walk out of here
a very rich man and disappear.

1222
01:31:02.551 --> 01:31:06.805
The great Taxman betraying his country.

1223
01:31:08.347 --> 01:31:11.685
No. Why would you do that?

1224
01:31:13.645 --> 01:31:17.690
What you said to me
about wasting my life. Made me think.

1225
01:31:20.777 --> 01:31:22.779
Let's not delay this new beginning.

1226
01:31:24.573 --> 01:31:25.657
The passcode.

1227
01:31:31.872 --> 01:31:32.872
Money first.

1228
01:31:34.457 --> 01:31:38.188
And... my price doubled.

1229
01:31:38.212 --> 01:31:40.506
Negotiations are over.

1230
01:31:43.132 --> 01:31:47.947
Well, negotiations are never over anytime.

1231
01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:48.971
You know, it...

1232
01:31:49.805 --> 01:31:51.725
actually reminds me of this one time
I was...

1233
01:31:53.644 --> 01:31:56.247
I was selling missiles to a arms dealer,

1234
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:59.333
and he was haggling and haggling,
wouldn't stop.

1235
01:31:59.358 --> 01:32:01.859
Finally, he bought the missiles and...

1236
01:32:03.779 --> 01:32:05.715
And he comes back an hour later,
and he says,

1237
01:32:05.738 --> 01:32:08.301
"I paid too much for these missiles.
I want a better price," you know.

1238
01:32:08.324 --> 01:32:10.886
And I said, "That's not how this works.
You can't haggle now."

1239
01:32:10.911 --> 01:32:14.181
He says, "I want a full refund.
I don't even want the missiles anymore."

1240
01:32:14.206 --> 01:32:17.018
I said to him, "Look,
I can't take these missiles back."

1241
01:32:17.042 --> 01:32:19.211
- "You've had them for an hour."
- Enough!

1242
01:32:20.378 --> 01:32:22.463
The passcode now!

1243
01:32:23.215 --> 01:32:24.757
Or you both die.

1244
01:32:27.010 --> 01:32:28.427
He gets very upset.

1245
01:32:29.887 --> 01:32:31.265
Do you have the passcode?

1246
01:32:33.391 --> 01:32:35.101
Do you have the passcode or not?

1247
01:32:35.601 --> 01:32:39.064
'Cause it is going to be very painful
for both of us if you do not.

1248
01:32:40.064 --> 01:32:41.274
My friend?

1249
01:33:11.054 --> 01:33:12.389
I'm sorry I'm late.

1250
01:33:18.811 --> 01:33:19.938
Glad you could make it.

1251
01:33:20.521 --> 01:33:24.025
Well, what can I say?
You might be growing on me.

1252
01:33:25.652 --> 01:33:26.819
What is this?

1253
01:33:27.404 --> 01:33:30.216
An opportunity for me to check out
all the players.

1254
01:33:30.239 --> 01:33:33.327
Mr. Utami, since you're the one
with the money, I'll address you.

1255
01:33:33.827 --> 01:33:36.913
The price of the passcode
is exactly half of Leveque's fee.

1256
01:33:38.332 --> 01:33:43.295
Wire it to this account
after that case opens.

1257
01:33:43.795 --> 01:33:45.631
You are the Taxman.

1258
01:33:46.215 --> 01:33:47.548
Here to collect.

1259
01:33:53.095 --> 01:33:55.742
In that case, then who are you?

1260
01:33:55.765 --> 01:33:56.891
My boyfriend.

1261
01:33:58.976 --> 01:34:00.061
Damn straight.

1262
01:34:00.979 --> 01:34:03.291
If you have the passcode,
I accept your terms.

1263
01:34:03.314 --> 01:34:05.317
- Mr. Utami...
- Open it.

1264
01:34:08.194 --> 01:34:09.756
You have the passcode?

1265
01:34:09.779 --> 01:34:11.698
I still have friends at the agency.

1266
01:34:13.283 --> 01:34:14.426
Wait a minute. You can't open that.

1267
01:34:14.451 --> 01:34:17.787
When the people you love are in danger,
you do whatever it takes.

1268
01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:48.400
Voilà.

1269
01:34:49.485 --> 01:34:51.904
Aztec, as promised.

1270
01:34:54.824 --> 01:34:56.033
Thank you very much.

1271
01:35:04.877 --> 01:35:06.729
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

1272
01:35:06.752 --> 01:35:08.380
Yes, thank you very much.

1273
01:35:09.006 --> 01:35:13.819
However, my business is not yet finished,
but you are.

1274
01:35:13.844 --> 01:35:17.805
What makes you think I will let you two
out of here alive?

1275
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:22.144
The ten-million-dollar bounty
I put on your head might help.

1276
01:35:24.354 --> 01:35:27.708
I don't know
how many bounty hunters are here,

1277
01:35:27.733 --> 01:35:29.859
but they definitely know about you.

1278
01:35:32.654 --> 01:35:34.155
Know what's funny?

1279
01:35:34.655 --> 01:35:38.886
Like you, I didn't actually have
the money until just now,

1280
01:35:38.911 --> 01:35:41.096
but the bounty hunters
didn't need to know that.

1281
01:35:41.121 --> 01:35:42.599
They just needed to know where you were.

1282
01:35:42.622 --> 01:35:45.100
Okay, Leveque.
You're worth a lot of money.

1283
01:35:45.125 --> 01:35:48.086
- I'll take that from you.
- Gun!

1284
01:35:48.628 --> 01:35:51.881
Nobody move!

1285
01:35:53.884 --> 01:35:56.112
You are so dead, my friend.

1286
01:35:56.136 --> 01:35:59.139
Tell your guys not to do anything stupid.

1287
01:36:23.247 --> 01:36:26.041
And what is the plan, huh?
Now what are you going to do?

1288
01:36:26.917 --> 01:36:28.770
Do nothing. You're coming with me.

1289
01:36:28.793 --> 01:36:30.771
How can I do nothing and come with you?

1290
01:36:30.796 --> 01:36:33.399
You idiot,
how are you going to get out of here?

1291
01:36:33.422 --> 01:36:38.177
I'll give you 20 million to shoot
this one. To kill her right now.

1292
01:36:50.649 --> 01:36:51.792
Are you ready?

1293
01:36:51.817 --> 01:36:54.152
Ready for what?
No, I'm not. I'm definitely not. What...

1294
01:37:31.148 --> 01:37:34.984
You flush them forward.
I will cut around. Get the vial. Now! Go!

1295
01:37:37.988 --> 01:37:38.988
Stairs.

1296
01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:05.849
Where you going?

1297
01:38:22.658 --> 01:38:23.926
Sadie?

1298
01:38:23.951 --> 01:38:25.327
I'm an ally.

1299
01:38:26.036 --> 01:38:28.412
- Jonas?
- I have missed you so much.

1300
01:38:29.372 --> 01:38:31.475
Listen, it was never gonna
work out between us.

1301
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.895
No, no, no, no. Of course it wasn't.
I was losing too many body parts.

1302
01:38:33.918 --> 01:38:35.939
That's not sustainable.
But if you look on the bright side,

1303
01:38:35.962 --> 01:38:37.296
I still have 20 vision.

1304
01:38:40.216 --> 01:38:41.903
Jonas,
I'm in the middle of something here.

1305
01:38:41.926 --> 01:38:44.905
I know. Look, losing the eye sucked.

1306
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:46.990
But I'll tell you,
getting this thing blown off,

1307
01:38:47.015 --> 01:38:48.827
that was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1308
01:38:48.850 --> 01:38:53.104
Seriously, it changed my whole life.
I'm a good, solid, active listener now.

1309
01:38:54.523 --> 01:38:55.792
That's the other ear.

1310
01:38:55.815 --> 01:38:58.527
I didn't need the ear.
You keep going. You do what you do.

1311
01:39:05.492 --> 01:39:06.891
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1312
01:39:09.162 --> 01:39:11.599
All right, yes.
That looked cool, but cheating.

1313
01:39:11.622 --> 01:39:15.103
You're not the Taxman.
Who the hell are you?

1314
01:39:15.127 --> 01:39:16.211
What she said.

1315
01:39:17.503 --> 01:39:18.963
I'm the boyfriend.

1316
01:39:39.609 --> 01:39:41.069
No!

1317
01:39:51.872 --> 01:39:53.140
You need to get me out.

1318
01:39:53.164 --> 01:39:54.707
No, you stay here.

1319
01:40:20.984 --> 01:40:22.235
Give me the weapon.

1320
01:40:35.164 --> 01:40:36.100
Damn it.

1321
01:40:36.125 --> 01:40:38.961
Come on, Taxman. Give me my weapon.

1322
01:41:12.661 --> 01:41:14.579
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1323
01:41:16.163 --> 01:41:18.166
Squandering all this talent.

1324
01:41:19.001 --> 01:41:22.378
- You and I could've had so much working...
- There's nothing you have that I want.

1325
01:41:42.481 --> 01:41:46.528
What is it that you want, huh?
You want a boyfriend? So pedestrian.

1326
01:41:47.695 --> 01:41:50.657
He does not know you.
He does not see the real you.

1327
01:42:02.168 --> 01:42:03.587
Cole?

1328
01:42:07.507 --> 01:42:08.550
Cole!

1329
01:42:42.876 --> 01:42:44.336
Get me over there!

1330
01:43:07.484 --> 01:43:09.278
You look amazing in that dress.

1331
01:43:10.612 --> 01:43:12.613
And you should wear more suits.

1332
01:43:36.387 --> 01:43:40.534
- He almost died in a refrigerator.
- But I did not do that. That was his.

1333
01:43:40.559 --> 01:43:42.953
- In a refrigerator, for how long?
- Was it you?

1334
01:43:42.978 --> 01:43:45.331
- Why would I put a cat in a fridge?
- What are you talking about?

1335
01:43:45.354 --> 01:43:47.167
- You didn't put him in.
- I think it's pretty clear.

1336
01:43:47.190 --> 01:43:50.170
- You didn't notice him when you closed it.
- Not the cat story.

1337
01:43:50.194 --> 01:43:53.256
- He did it.
- Yeah, the cat story again.

1338
01:43:53.279 --> 01:43:56.842
So, Europe by rail.
That sounds so romantic.

1339
01:43:56.867 --> 01:43:58.720
You want to write a book,
you got to do research.

1340
01:43:58.743 --> 01:44:00.387
What's Sadie supposed to do
in all these places

1341
01:44:00.412 --> 01:44:02.265
while you're reading musty old scrolls
about farming?

1342
01:44:02.288 --> 01:44:06.167
Don't worry about me. I have a whole list
of clients I need to hunt down.

1343
01:44:06.752 --> 01:44:08.270
I'm sure you're gonna get them all, dear.

1344
01:44:08.295 --> 01:44:09.230
I know I will.

1345
01:44:09.255 --> 01:44:10.398
Yeah, she will.

1346
01:44:10.421 --> 01:44:12.567
Art curating is so much more exciting
than I imagined.

1347
01:44:12.591 --> 01:44:14.944
- Yeah
- Yeah. God, like, I want to be you.

1348
01:44:14.967 --> 01:44:17.404
I mean, except the part where
you're sleeping with my brother.

1349
01:44:17.429 --> 01:44:18.530
What?

1350
01:44:18.555 --> 01:44:20.158
Just, please.

1351
01:44:20.181 --> 01:44:21.493
- So...
- We're at the dinner table.

1352
01:44:21.516 --> 01:44:23.744
You guys promise to take care
of this little guy while we're gone?

1353
01:44:23.769 --> 01:44:25.287
Yes, I love succulents.

1354
01:44:25.311 --> 01:44:28.666
- How hard is it to keep a cactus alive?
- Sometimes harder than you think.

1355
01:44:28.689 --> 01:44:31.693
- But worth it.
- Very much.

1356
01:44:33.278 --> 01:44:35.215
I mean, we're talking about a cactus.
Right?

1357
01:44:35.238 --> 01:44:36.591
You water it once a month.

1358
01:44:36.614 --> 01:44:38.801
- Or are we talking... Okay. It's subtext.
- Okay.

1359
01:44:38.824 --> 01:44:40.427
- That's right.
- There's a...

1360
01:44:40.452 --> 01:44:42.262
- There's a hidden meaning.
- Yep. There's... And then...

1361
01:44:42.287 --> 01:44:43.722
- Levels.
- Okay, that's great.

1362
01:44:43.747 --> 01:44:46.475
- Your mother and I have a...
- There's no "mother and I" story.

1363
01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:48.853
- It's not about a cactus.
- No, it is not.

1364
01:44:48.877 --> 01:44:50.170
It involves wrestling.

1365
01:44:51.421 --> 01:44:54.943
Did he ever tell you that he wrestled
in high school?

1366
01:44:54.966 --> 01:44:56.694
Keep drinking your wine.
Keep drinking your wine.

1367
01:44:56.717 --> 01:44:58.177
Okay.

1368
01:45:11.399 --> 01:45:15.654
- Hey, babe, I'm sorry I'm late.
- Nice car.

1369
01:45:16.613 --> 01:45:19.716
Are you sure the CIA didn't let you
keep Utami's money after all?

1370
01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:22.302
You wish. I'm borrowing this.

1371
01:45:22.327 --> 01:45:24.430
How was your meeting
with Professor Kirkland?

1372
01:45:24.453 --> 01:45:25.849
- Really good.
- Yeah?

1373
01:45:25.872 --> 01:45:27.666
He gave me some amazing research.

1374
01:45:29.333 --> 01:45:30.435
This is Raul.

1375
01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:31.962
He's an arms dealer,

1376
01:45:32.837 --> 01:45:34.672
but business stays in the car.

1377
01:45:37.717 --> 01:45:38.717
