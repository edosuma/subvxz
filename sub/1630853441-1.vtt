Of course, I am.

02:45.472 --> 02:48.473
I'm sorry, Will.

02:59.717 --> 03:04.654
Listen, I just wanna say that...

03:04.689 --> 03:08.955
I know we said we weren't gonna
talk about it, but...

03:08.990 --> 03:11.463
What was his name again?

03:11.498 --> 03:12.893
Will, just don't.

03:12.928 --> 03:14.664
Anyway, just wanna say that...

03:18.967 --> 03:22.672
I know that was hard for you
to talk about it.

03:24.346 --> 03:26.478
Just in case, it's in your head
or something I just...

03:28.944 --> 03:31.978
I just want you to know
that I forgive you.

03:32.013 --> 03:33.881
And I'm-- I'm--
I'm good with it.

03:33.916 --> 03:36.983
I'm not good--
I'm not good with it...

03:39.988 --> 03:44.298
but I appreciate you
bein' honest with me.

03:50.702 --> 03:52.339
Finally, we're almost there.

03:53.936 --> 03:54.935
Yeah,
I'm gonna have to pull over

03:54.970 --> 03:55.969
and get some gas.

03:56.004 --> 03:58.576
Almost run empty.

03:58.611 --> 04:01.414
Uh, it's only about 15 minutes
to my parents' house.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.778
-Are you that low?
-Uh, actually, I am.

04:04.980 --> 04:06.683
Unless you wanna get out
and push the car.

04:06.718 --> 04:09.785
Mm, I do not want to do that.

04:09.820 --> 04:12.326
-Shut up then.

04:27.805 --> 04:32.005
-Are you gonna get gas?
-Yeah.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.273
I was gonna throw it out there,
though.

04:33.308 --> 04:37.076
What do you say, I fill her up
and we drive back to Manchester?

04:37.111 --> 04:39.815
Or off into the sunset or...

04:39.850 --> 04:41.080
-Off into the sunset?
-- Or--

04:41.115 --> 04:42.818
-I don't know. Something.
-- Hmm.

04:42.853 --> 04:44.523
We could go on a holiday,
we could--

04:44.558 --> 04:47.119
Look, I-- I need this break,
I need to clear my mind.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.022
I need to gain
a better perspective.

04:51.092 --> 04:53.026
This is the best I can do, okay?

04:53.061 --> 04:54.401
Yeah.

04:57.131 --> 05:01.738
Well... at least,
it's your mother's.

05:01.773 --> 05:04.444
I mean after two weeks with her

05:04.479 --> 05:07.711
and you're gonna be desperate
to come back and see me.

05:07.746 --> 05:10.879
-No?
-Uh, well, we'll see.

05:13.114 --> 05:14.619
I'm gonna grab some water.

05:14.654 --> 05:15.686
Get some gas.

05:32.474 --> 05:34.771
Oh, fuck.

06:19.521 --> 06:20.487
Yo, Nate. Will.

06:38.166 --> 06:40.100
No, no, no,
you can't pull out of the deal.

06:40.135 --> 06:41.468
I owe this money to my subs.

06:41.503 --> 06:43.543
<i>Look, Will, I understand,</i>
<i>but you gotta say.</i>

06:43.578 --> 06:44.907
-Hi, just this.
-- That's it?

06:44.942 --> 06:46.546
Yeah.

06:50.046 --> 06:52.211
-Thanks. You can keep it.
-Thank you.

06:58.087 --> 06:59.625
Uh, uh, excuse me.

07:13.938 --> 07:15.267
-Thanks.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.093
Lisa.

08:14.636 --> 08:15.734
Lisa?

08:34.722 --> 08:36.018
Hello?

08:55.270 --> 08:56.841
Excuse me,
I'm looking for my wife.

08:56.876 --> 08:57.941
You didn't see a woman in here

08:57.976 --> 09:00.911
She's wearin' white top, jeans.

09:00.946 --> 09:02.044
-No?
-Check the bathroom.

09:02.079 --> 09:04.343
Yeah, I just--
I just checked 'em.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.982
Okay, I don't know.

09:24.167 --> 09:25.364
<i>Hi, you've reached Lisa.</i>

09:25.399 --> 09:27.674
<i>Leave me a message</i>
<i>and I'll call you back.</i>

09:27.709 --> 09:30.303
Hey, Lisa, it's me.

09:30.338 --> 09:32.206
Hey, where are you?

09:32.241 --> 09:34.109
I'm at the other side
of the gas station.

09:34.144 --> 09:35.748
You gonna call me back,
I'm lookin' for you.

09:41.822 --> 09:43.316
Excuse me!

09:43.351 --> 09:45.989
Did you see a woman in a--
uh, she's wearin' a white top,

09:46.024 --> 09:49.355
blue jeans, dark hair,
walkin' around out here?

09:49.390 --> 09:50.895
No, I haven't.

09:58.333 --> 09:59.739
Lisa!

10:04.042 --> 10:05.404
Lisa!

10:07.408 --> 10:09.111
What the fuck?

10:12.380 --> 10:13.819
Lisa!

10:17.253 --> 10:18.450
Hi, you've reached Lisa.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.122
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

10:20.157 --> 10:22.190
All right, Lis,
this isn't funny.

10:22.225 --> 10:25.391
Where'd you go?

10:25.426 --> 10:26.832
All right, listen,
you gotta call me back.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.900
I'm lookin' for you,
I'm gettin' worried.

10:28.935 --> 10:30.869
Wait inside the gas station.

10:37.108 --> 10:38.206
Sure you didn't see anybody
in here?

10:38.241 --> 10:39.977
White top.

10:40.012 --> 10:41.110
-Yeah, no, you saw--
-- Thick dark hair. Yeah.

10:41.145 --> 10:42.045
White top, I heard you.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.718
Um, what'd she buy?

10:44.753 --> 10:46.984
I think she was getting water
or maybe something else.

10:47.019 --> 10:48.887
-I don't know.
-All right, I don't know.

10:48.922 --> 10:51.483
Uh, check the car maybe.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.089
I'll check it again.

10:53.124 --> 10:54.354
But if you see her,
will you let her know

10:54.389 --> 10:55.894
just stay here?

10:55.929 --> 10:56.928
Her name's Lisa.

10:56.963 --> 10:57.830
-Yeah, man.
-- Yeah?

10:57.865 --> 10:58.531
Sure.

10:58.566 --> 11:00.800
-Thanks. Uh.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.364
Lisa!

11:06.401 --> 11:08.500
Hey, you didn't see a-- a--
a woman in a white shirt?

11:08.535 --> 11:10.172
-Mm-mm.
-Walking around here?

11:10.207 --> 11:12.207
You didn't see a woman in a--
a white T-shirt

11:12.242 --> 11:14.275
with thick dark hair?

11:14.310 --> 11:17.784
Guys, did you see a woman
walkin' around here.

11:17.819 --> 11:19.313
She was wearin' a white T-shirt.

11:22.021 --> 11:23.416
Lisa!

11:52.546 --> 11:54.315
Come on, Lisa.

12:07.528 --> 12:09.099
Lisa!

12:20.607 --> 12:22.409
Hey buddy,
sorry to bother you again.

12:22.444 --> 12:24.147
I can't find my wife anywhere.

12:24.182 --> 12:26.446
So give-- give me the--
the address of this gas station.

12:26.481 --> 12:28.250
101, Route 64.

12:28.285 --> 12:30.483
Is there a local number
for the police here?

12:30.518 --> 12:32.991
Uh, 9-1-1.

12:33.026 --> 12:34.091

<i>I-- I can't find her.</i>

12:56.214 --> 12:58.247
Hey, Roy,
you mind taking line three?

12:58.282 --> 12:59.479
Name's Spann.

12:59.514 --> 13:01.019
Said he lost his wife
at the Veldro station.

13:01.054 --> 13:02.152
Lost his wife?

13:02.187 --> 13:04.121
Yeah, that's what he said.

13:04.156 --> 13:04.855
All right, thanks.

13:04.890 --> 13:06.585
All right.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.386
<i>Mr. Spann,</i>
<i>this is Detective Paterson.</i>

13:07.421 --> 13:08.191
-Yeah.
-- <i> So, uh--</i>

13:08.226 --> 13:09.626
Hi.

13:09.661 --> 13:10.293
<i>You're sayin' you--</i>
<i>you can't find your wife.</i>

13:10.328 --> 13:11.127
Yeah, I can't find my wife.

13:11.163 --> 13:13.394
I-- we-- I--
I stopped to get gas,

13:13.429 --> 13:15.198
she came in to get a drink,
and--

13:15.233 --> 13:17.365
and that was
like 20 minutes ago.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.400
I've been--
I can't see her anywhere.

13:19.435 --> 13:21.204
<i>Well, it's not very long.</i>

13:21.239 --> 13:22.403
You checked the bathroom?

13:22.438 --> 13:23.943
Yeah, yeah,
I checked the bathroom,

13:23.978 --> 13:25.307
I checked
the whole damn gas station.

13:25.342 --> 13:27.375
I've been all around the front,
and the back, and--

13:27.410 --> 13:28.948
<i>Okay, Mr. Spann, okay.</i>

13:28.983 --> 13:29.849
What's your--
what's your wife's name?

13:29.884 --> 13:31.280
<i>Her name is Lisa Spann.</i>

13:31.315 --> 13:32.479
Lisa Spann.

13:32.514 --> 13:35.086
Yeah, she's 5'9",
she's uh, dark hair,

13:35.121 --> 13:36.318
and she's wearin'
a pair of blue jeans,

13:36.353 --> 13:38.221
and a-- and a white T-shirt.

13:38.256 --> 13:39.992
<i>-Short sleeves.</i>
-Okay.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.653
-Is she from the area?
-No.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.358
Well, originally,
she's from this area.

13:43.393 --> 13:44.491
Yeah, I mean her parents

13:44.526 --> 13:45.965
just live along the road
in Emerson.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.429
Well,
maybe she ran into a friend.

13:48.464 --> 13:52.004
Do you think your wife
would just run off with a friend

13:52.039 --> 13:54.039
when I'm putting gas
in the car?

13:54.074 --> 13:55.106
<i>Uh, uh, all right, all right.</i>

13:55.141 --> 13:56.668
<i>Listen, Mr. Spann, just relax.</i>

13:56.703 --> 13:58.175
<i>I'll dispatch someone</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

13:58.210 --> 14:00.507
What-- what--
what is soon as possible?

14:00.542 --> 14:02.608
<i>Well, listen, I don't have</i>
<i>anyone available just now.</i>

14:02.643 --> 14:03.576
<i>-I'll call you back.</i>
-All right, well, l-- listen,

14:03.611 --> 14:05.248
we're in a bit
of an emergency here, okay?

14:05.283 --> 14:06.513
There's truck drivers
everywhere.

14:06.548 --> 14:08.251
Well,
I mean time is of the essence.

14:08.286 --> 14:09.318
She could be anywhere.

14:09.353 --> 14:10.990
<i>She could be in danger.</i>

14:11.025 --> 14:12.552
I understand
you're stressed out.

14:12.587 --> 14:14.928
I'll send someone
as soon as possible, okay?

14:14.963 --> 14:16.226
Okay, okay, okay.

14:16.261 --> 14:17.359
<i>I'll come myself if I have to.</i>

14:17.394 --> 14:19.064
Okay. Okay, thank you.

14:19.099 --> 14:20.626
Just be as quick as you can,
okay?

14:20.661 --> 14:22.463
<i>Stay by your phone,</i>

15:14.686 --> 15:17.056
<i>We're not in.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

15:17.091 --> 15:20.521
Hey, Barry, Anna, it's Will.

15:20.556 --> 15:22.259
Can you guys call me back?
I'm lookin' for Lisa.

15:22.294 --> 15:23.260
Thank you, bye.

15:24.593 --> 15:25.757
Fuck.

15:50.619 --> 15:51.285
Lisa?

15:51.320 --> 15:53.158
I think that's them, sweetie.

15:54.689 --> 15:55.787
-- Lisa.
-- You got it?

15:55.822 --> 15:56.287
Hi, Will.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.064
-- Hi.
-Oh.

15:58.099 --> 15:59.758
-- Hey, how are you?
-Hey, I'm good. Where's Lisa?

15:59.793 --> 16:01.694
Uh, I-- I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

16:01.729 --> 16:03.465
Is she here?

16:03.500 --> 16:06.039
No, she's not-- she's with you.

16:06.074 --> 16:08.107
No, she was with me.

16:08.142 --> 16:09.801
-Lisa!
-- Hello.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.243
-- Well, she's not here.
-- Okay, okay.

16:12.278 --> 16:14.608
-- Barry!
-Yes, sweetie.

16:14.643 --> 16:15.309
Hi.

16:15.344 --> 16:17.677
-Hey, Barry!
-Will's here.

16:17.712 --> 16:19.646
- Um, I-- I, uh--
-- What's the matter?

16:19.681 --> 16:20.779
I don't know. Something's wrong.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.220
What?

16:22.255 --> 16:23.353
You guys didn't hear from her?
She didn't call?

16:23.388 --> 16:24.651
-No, she's-- is it--
-What? No.

16:24.686 --> 16:26.257
I-- I-- I thought
maybe she came here.

16:26.292 --> 16:27.058
Uh, no, wait a second.

16:27.093 --> 16:28.490
No, uh-- uh,
weren't you supposed

16:28.525 --> 16:31.097
-to drop her off here?
-Yeah.

16:31.132 --> 16:34.331
Uh, one minute she was here,
the next minute she was gone.

16:34.366 --> 16:36.069
Uh, what uh,
what do you mean by that?

16:37.732 --> 16:39.303
What do you mean she's gone?

16:39.338 --> 16:42.141
We stopped to get gas,

16:42.176 --> 16:45.342
and she went into the market,
and...

16:45.377 --> 16:48.081
-- Right.
-She didn't come back out.

16:48.116 --> 16:48.915
I don't--

16:48.950 --> 16:50.314
She's still
in the gas station then.

16:50.349 --> 16:52.250
No, she's not still
in the gas station.

16:52.285 --> 16:53.251
-- I--
-Is she in the--

16:53.286 --> 16:54.252
In the bathroom? Did you check--

16:54.287 --> 16:55.649
I've looked in the restrooms,
I've looked--

16:55.684 --> 16:57.189
Yes, I checked the whole damn
gas station.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.421
Okay, which ga--
which gas station

16:58.456 --> 16:59.554
were you're at?
Let's start there.

16:59.589 --> 17:02.260
The Veldro on uh, you know, 64.

17:02.295 --> 17:04.526
Okay, that's about five miles
from here,

17:04.561 --> 17:06.693
so she wouldn't walk from there.

17:06.728 --> 17:09.168
So, I have to ask you this,
Will,

17:09.203 --> 17:11.632
uh, did you have a fight?

17:11.667 --> 17:14.107
Is that what this is?
You had a fight and--

17:14.142 --> 17:16.538
No, Barry,
we didn't have a fight.

17:16.573 --> 17:18.705
We're going through some stuff
as-- as you know,

17:18.740 --> 17:20.245
but we did not have a fight.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.609
And I can't explain--
okay, listen,

17:21.644 --> 17:24.117
did she have anybody else know
she was comin'?

17:24.152 --> 17:25.877
Any friends or anything
or anybody that--

17:25.912 --> 17:26.778
Just friends.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.814
But did you speak
to any of her friends?

17:28.849 --> 17:30.585
No, wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait!

17:30.620 --> 17:31.817
Now uh, listen,
what are you saying?

17:31.852 --> 17:33.819
That it's because of us?
Is that it?

17:33.854 --> 17:35.491
-I'm not blamin' anybody.
-Now, that's insane.

17:35.526 --> 17:36.225
You know,
anybody else who she was--

17:36.260 --> 17:37.757
No, no, please, it's insulting.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.132
What are you talkin' about,
Barry!

17:39.167 --> 17:39.899
-I'm not blaming anybody!
-- Okay.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.167
-You did!
-- I-- I'm just--

17:41.203 --> 17:42.268
That-- that was the implication.
Do you have any friends here?

17:42.304 --> 17:43.532
I asked if you knew
she was coming here.

17:43.567 --> 17:46.139
Okay!

17:46.174 --> 17:48.438
Okay, guys,
you can think what you want,

17:48.473 --> 17:50.242
but this is me, Will, all right?

17:50.277 --> 17:51.606
-No, I--
-- I-- I-- and this--

17:51.641 --> 17:53.410
I know,
but it's not Will and Lisa.

17:53.445 --> 17:54.807
You see,
we were expecting Will and Lisa.

17:54.842 --> 17:56.215
Yeah, okay.

17:56.250 --> 17:58.679
Well, let's get
about finding Lisa, okay?

17:58.714 --> 18:00.186
I'm uh, I gotta go by.

18:00.221 --> 18:01.087
I called the police

18:01.122 --> 18:02.650
and they're comin'
at the gas station.

18:02.685 --> 18:04.223
-You guys stay here.
-Okay.

18:04.258 --> 18:05.686
Just in case she comes.

18:05.721 --> 18:07.589
And maybe call her friends,
see if anybody heard from her.

18:07.624 --> 18:08.523
-- Right.
-- Yeah.

18:08.559 --> 18:09.789
Right? And call me
if you're hear anything.

18:09.824 --> 18:11.230
-I will, I promise.
-Of course.

18:11.265 --> 18:12.693
-- All right.

18:12.728 --> 18:13.859
Oh my God.

18:13.894 --> 18:14.626
No, we're gonna call the cops
right now.

18:14.662 --> 18:15.527
What do you mean
call her friends?

18:15.563 --> 18:17.269
-What the fuck is that?
-I don't ev--

18:17.304 --> 18:18.203
I don't understand what he said.

18:18.239 --> 18:18.804
I don't even know
if I believe him

18:18.839 --> 18:20.272
that he called the cops..

18:20.307 --> 18:21.702
I don't either.
I don't trust him!

18:21.737 --> 18:23.209
This doesn't make any sense.

18:23.244 --> 18:24.870
Oh, it makes sense to me.

18:24.905 --> 18:27.345
Uh, he was acting weird.

18:27.380 --> 18:28.511
Did you see him?

19:21.797 --> 19:23.401
Ooh!

19:23.436 --> 19:25.304
Hey.

19:25.339 --> 19:27.339
I got the steering column
workin'.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.073
Oh yeah?

19:28.108 --> 19:30.342
Yeah, cables were-- were fried.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.311
Oh. Hmm.

19:32.346 --> 19:33.774
Maybe it's time to get her wet.

19:35.481 --> 19:38.713
-You want a drink?
-No. No, thanks.

19:38.748 --> 19:40.649
-Okay, I'm gonna have a beer.
-Okay.

19:43.951 --> 19:46.292
You okay?

19:47.955 --> 19:48.987
No.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.329
What's the matter?

19:51.926 --> 19:53.332
Will, um...

19:56.799 --> 19:58.799
-I think we need a break.
-Oh, Christ.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.381
W-- i-- i-- uh, is it the work?

20:09.416 --> 20:11.878
I mean I know
I've not been around so much,

20:11.913 --> 20:13.781
but at least I'm almost finished
with this stuff.

20:13.816 --> 20:14.482
I told you
there's gonna be a few--

20:14.517 --> 20:15.849
I know, I know. Uh--

20:15.884 --> 20:17.290
I understand.

20:17.325 --> 20:22.427
It's just...
I don't actually know what it is

20:22.462 --> 20:23.161
and that's the problem.

20:23.196 --> 20:24.924
I can't fix what I don't know--

20:24.959 --> 20:26.464
Well, that's fucking great,
isn't it?

20:26.499 --> 20:27.828
So, you don't know what's wrong.

20:27.863 --> 20:29.698
You don't communicate to me
what's wrong. Is it--

20:29.733 --> 20:31.304
I'm trying to communicate
to you right now

20:31.339 --> 20:32.305
and is this how
you're gonna behave?

20:32.340 --> 20:33.172
Yeah, yeah, well,
what is it this time, Lisa?

20:33.208 --> 20:35.033
-Your depression?
-I'm not depressed.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.607
Uh, you're unfulfilled again,
because we know what happens

20:37.642 --> 20:38.773
when you're unfulfilled.

20:38.808 --> 20:41.479
We've been there,
I dealt with that.

20:41.514 --> 20:42.513
But that's not enough.

20:49.423 --> 20:50.818
-I'm sorry.
-D-- No, it's--

20:50.853 --> 20:52.952
I'm sorry, I'm sorry that--
Uh. I'm sorry.

20:55.594 --> 21:01.026
I don't feel anything anymore.

21:01.061 --> 21:02.599
It's like I'm just numb.

21:02.634 --> 21:03.897
That's the worst part of it.

21:03.932 --> 21:06.768
I can't even pinpoint why

21:06.803 --> 21:09.771
and I think some time apart
would be really beneficial.

21:09.806 --> 21:13.412
Get some clarity, some space.

21:30.926 --> 21:32.728
-Detective Paterson.
-Mr. Spann?

21:32.763 --> 21:34.499
-- Yeah.
-All right.

21:34.534 --> 21:37.601
-Any uh, news about your wife?
-No.

21:37.636 --> 21:39.801
It's--
it's an hour and a half now.

21:39.836 --> 21:41.506
I-- I haven't seen her.

21:41.541 --> 21:43.376
I-- I went to her parents' house
in Emerson

21:43.411 --> 21:45.411
and she didn't
show up there either.

21:45.446 --> 21:46.907
Why would you go there?

21:46.942 --> 21:47.908
Well,
that's where I was takin' her.

21:47.943 --> 21:50.108
I thought maybe she--
she would go by there.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.846
But we asked you to stay here,

21:51.881 --> 21:52.979
'cause she could have
come back here.

21:53.014 --> 21:53.980
Look,
I'm clutchin' the straws here.

21:54.015 --> 21:56.521
I-- I don't really know
what the protocol is

21:56.556 --> 21:57.885
for a missing wife.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.458
So yeah, I took action
and I went lookin' for her.

21:59.493 --> 22:00.525
-All right, uh--
-I don't know what the--

22:00.560 --> 22:02.461
What are her parents' names?

22:02.496 --> 22:04.958
Uh, Anna and Barry Adams.

22:04.993 --> 22:06.795
Oh, the Adams.
I know the Adams a little bit.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.665
Good people.

22:08.700 --> 22:09.666
Yeah, the good people, yeah.

22:09.701 --> 22:12.735
Did she um, leave behind
any personal belongings?

22:12.770 --> 22:14.000
-A purse?
-Yeah, yeah.

22:14.035 --> 22:15.936
-I found her purse in the car.
-Okay.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.975
And I have her computer as well.

22:22.010 --> 22:22.976
Okay, well, hold on to that.

22:23.011 --> 22:25.110
Let me just look at this.

22:25.145 --> 22:26.144
You have her phone, do you, huh?

22:26.179 --> 22:27.684
No, I think she had her phone.

22:27.719 --> 22:30.489
I-- I-- I tried Find My Phone,
but it must be off.

22:30.524 --> 22:32.788
All right. Let's head inside.

22:37.498 --> 22:38.827
Oscar.

22:38.862 --> 22:39.993
Detective.

22:40.028 --> 22:41.159
Uh, what you need? Coffee?

22:41.194 --> 22:43.128
No, no, I need the uh,
camera footage

22:43.163 --> 22:44.866
from the surveillance.

22:44.901 --> 22:46.769
Uh, the camera's been busted
a couple weeks.

22:46.804 --> 22:47.603
I got a guy comin' out,

22:47.638 --> 22:49.002
but they keep sayin'
they comin' out.

22:49.037 --> 22:50.443
Nobody showed up yet.

22:50.478 --> 22:52.203
Well, this man says
his wife is missing.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.743
You've been sitting here
all day.

22:53.778 --> 22:55.712
-Did you see anybody?
-I-- I didn't seen a thing.

22:55.747 --> 22:58.484
Shoot. All right, listen,
I'ma head back to the station,

22:58.519 --> 23:00.079
-issue out an APB.
-Yeah.

23:00.114 --> 23:01.883
You wanna come with me?
I can take a full statement.

23:03.722 --> 23:06.591
No, I think I--
I'm gonna stay here.

23:06.626 --> 23:08.791
-Just in case she shows up.
-All right.

23:08.826 --> 23:11.629
You mind if I-- computer.

23:11.664 --> 23:12.630
Do you know what's the code?

23:14.634 --> 23:16.161
No, I-- I--
she didn't give it to me.

23:16.196 --> 23:17.569
Uh, don't worry.

23:17.604 --> 23:18.933
I got one of them whizz kids
down there.

23:18.968 --> 23:20.473
He can crack anything.

23:25.876 --> 23:29.614
So what I just--
do I still hang out front?

23:29.649 --> 23:32.078
Yeah, like I said,
just be reachable.

23:32.113 --> 23:33.651
Okay.

23:33.686 --> 23:35.114
-Thank you.
-- Uh-huh.

24:37.013 --> 24:38.881
Hey, Oscar, yeah?

24:38.916 --> 24:40.652
-Uh, back again, huh?
-Yeah.

24:41.985 --> 24:47.153
Um, you said the camera's
not workin'.

24:47.188 --> 24:48.891
Yeah, I already told you,
it's fuckin' busted.

24:48.926 --> 24:50.255
Yeah, you said it to me,
you said it to the detective.

24:50.290 --> 24:52.631
-It's 'cause it's busted.
-Right.

24:52.666 --> 24:54.600
See, I know a thing
about these uh, cameras.

24:54.635 --> 24:58.736
I've worked quite a few
and uh, that's live.

24:58.771 --> 25:00.804
It's workin'.

25:00.839 --> 25:03.103
No, it must-- uh,
maybe there's a battery in there

25:03.138 --> 25:04.302
-or something--
-What are you playin' on?

25:04.337 --> 25:05.470
What are you talking about?

25:05.505 --> 25:07.646
What are you playin' on?
What's goin' on here?

25:07.681 --> 25:09.010
Buddy, I got no video here,
okay?

25:09.045 --> 25:09.911
Yeah, you got no screen.

25:09.946 --> 25:10.945
Yeah, what do you want from me?

25:10.981 --> 25:13.344
You might have no feed,
but that's recording.

25:13.379 --> 25:15.016
Uh, we mind
our own fuckin' business here,

25:15.051 --> 25:16.314
all right, man?

25:16.349 --> 25:17.048
Did you say you mind
your own fuckin' business?

25:17.083 --> 25:18.182
Yeah, get the fuck out of here.

25:18.218 --> 25:19.856
We're talkin'
about my fuckin' wife here.

25:19.891 --> 25:20.990
-Well, not my problem.
-Uh, really?

25:21.026 --> 25:21.457
-That's how you're gonna be?
-- Not my problem.

25:21.493 --> 25:22.559
Get the fuck out.

25:22.594 --> 25:23.393
Okay, I'm gonna need to look
at this footage, man.

25:23.428 --> 25:25.258
Hey.
Hey, what the fuck you doin'?

25:25.294 --> 25:26.460
You won't mind if I hav a look.

25:26.495 --> 25:27.060
-- Hey, nobody back here.
-You won't have a problem.

25:27.096 --> 25:28.194
Get the f-- hey!

25:29.362 --> 25:31.098
Get the fuck--

25:31.133 --> 25:33.771
-Filthy, little motherfucker.

25:33.806 --> 25:35.300
What the fuck
are you playin' at?

25:35.335 --> 25:39.172
Listen! What the--

25:39.207 --> 25:41.075
What's the fuckin' matter
with you?

25:41.110 --> 25:43.814
-You run the fuckin' place!
-I'm kidding. Man, okay, okay!

25:43.849 --> 25:45.849
-It's right there.
-Thank you!

25:55.421 --> 25:56.893
Piece of shit.

26:04.166 --> 26:05.264
Fuck!

26:08.401 --> 26:10.775
What the fuck is going on here?

26:20.787 --> 26:22.017
Hi there.

26:22.052 --> 26:24.349
Um, I'm here to see uh,
Detective Paterson.

26:24.384 --> 26:25.889
Paterson.

26:25.924 --> 26:27.286
Yo.

26:27.321 --> 26:29.354
We got uh, Mr. Spann here.

26:29.389 --> 26:30.993
-Hey.
-- Hey.

26:31.028 --> 26:32.830
He's got the CCTV.

26:32.865 --> 26:34.293
I thought it was broken.

26:34.328 --> 26:37.197
Yeah, so did I.

26:37.232 --> 26:38.671
Oscar gave it to me.

26:38.706 --> 26:40.101
That damn Oscar.

26:40.136 --> 26:41.036
Let's go plug it in.

26:43.304 --> 26:46.074
Hey, Mike! Heads up, incoming.

26:53.017 --> 26:54.819
One second.

26:56.757 --> 26:58.724
Your man Oscar is connected
with this, by the way.

26:58.759 --> 27:00.693
-Okay. All right
-I'm just--

27:00.728 --> 27:03.729
I took it out around- 30,
so you gotta go back

27:03.764 --> 27:06.424
to like 10 or- 55 or something.

27:11.398 --> 27:13.871
Back more, just go--
go back some more.

27:13.906 --> 27:14.839
-Back up a little bit.
-Got it.

27:14.874 --> 27:16.676
Back up a little bit.
A couple of minutes.

27:19.109 --> 27:20.042
So, that-- would-- that's it?

27:20.077 --> 27:22.044
No, no. That's-- that's not her.

27:22.079 --> 27:23.441
No, you gotta go--
go back some more.

27:26.886 --> 27:28.380
There she-- there--
that's her comin' out.

27:42.198 --> 27:44.363
All right, who's that man?

27:46.136 --> 27:47.069
I don't--
I don't know who that is.

27:47.104 --> 27:49.203
I-- I--

27:49.238 --> 27:51.843
He seems to know
who your wife is.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.174
I've never seen him in my life.

28:02.251 --> 28:03.756
Oh, this fuckin' truck.

28:05.287 --> 28:07.155
Well...

28:07.190 --> 28:08.992
Come on. Come on, move it.

28:15.066 --> 28:16.769
Okay, wait, wait, he-- he--
he has her.

28:16.804 --> 28:17.837
He's have to taken her.

28:17.872 --> 28:18.804
-All right, all right.
-That's-- that's your man.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.070
We'll have some guys
look into it, all right?

28:21.105 --> 28:22.302
-Anderson, why don't you go--
-Can you go back in on him?

28:22.337 --> 28:23.776
Track down Oscar, all right?

28:23.811 --> 28:24.643
Yeah.

28:24.679 --> 28:25.478
I bet he knows who this guy is.

28:25.513 --> 28:27.373
-Thank you.
-All right, thank you.

28:27.408 --> 28:28.847
All right, in the meantime,

28:28.882 --> 28:29.714
you mind
if we go in another room,

28:29.750 --> 28:31.377
I ask you a few questions
in private?

28:31.412 --> 28:32.477
-Yeah, sure, let's do it.
-- All right.

28:36.384 --> 28:37.856
Follow me.

28:42.126 --> 28:44.522
Come on in, have a seat.

28:51.432 --> 28:54.499
<i>Uh, some water?</i>

28:54.534 --> 28:55.566
<i>Coffee or anything?</i>

28:55.601 --> 28:57.909
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

28:57.944 --> 29:02.111
So, you sure you don't know
who that man is?

29:02.146 --> 29:04.542
No, I've never seen him before
in my life. Uh, no.

29:04.577 --> 29:06.049
Okay, no, it's-- it's okay.

29:06.084 --> 29:09.250
I mean he just seemed
to uh, have a--

29:09.285 --> 29:10.581
Be pretty familiar
with your wife.

29:10.616 --> 29:12.583
-Th-- that's all.
-I don't know.

29:12.618 --> 29:15.322
I mean uh, doesn't look
like the kinda person

29:15.357 --> 29:16.521
that Lisa would be friends with.

29:16.556 --> 29:18.094
-Okay.
-I-- I know her pretty well.

29:18.129 --> 29:19.458
All right.

29:19.493 --> 29:21.031
So Lisa's from her,
she's got friends from here.

29:21.066 --> 29:22.329
Do you--
do you know any of them?

29:22.364 --> 29:26.366
No, I don't really know
any of her friends.

29:26.401 --> 29:29.171
She-- she didn't really talk
about her high school.

29:31.076 --> 29:32.207
That's unusual.

29:35.278 --> 29:37.883
So you were um, on your way
to Lisa's folks' house, right?

29:37.918 --> 29:40.314
Uh, Adams, in Emerson?

29:40.349 --> 29:42.118
Yeah. Like I said,
I was takin' her there

29:42.153 --> 29:43.482
to drop her off, yeah.

29:45.156 --> 29:48.520
You know, I--
I have to ask you um...

29:48.555 --> 29:50.027
how's your marriage?

29:53.593 --> 29:55.164
Where are we going with this?
I don't-- I don't--

30:07.915 --> 30:10.179
We-- we-- we were--

30:10.214 --> 30:13.083
We're going
through a rough time.

30:13.118 --> 30:15.217
Oh, so it was gonna be a--
a separation?

30:15.252 --> 30:16.581
No, it's not a separation.

30:16.616 --> 30:19.155
She just said she needed
a bit of a break, that's all.

30:19.190 --> 30:20.156
So not a divorce?

30:20.191 --> 30:24.061
No, not-- I don't get
the relevance of this.

30:28.199 --> 30:29.396
Do you and your wife um...

30:31.400 --> 30:32.938
-You guys fight?
-No.

30:34.469 --> 30:36.073
No, there's just been
some tension.

30:36.108 --> 30:40.407
We don't fight, we don't scream,
we don't shout.

30:40.442 --> 30:41.375
So did you have a fight
on the way here?

30:41.410 --> 30:43.410
No, we did not have a fight
in the way here.

30:45.645 --> 30:46.611
Okay.

30:48.714 --> 30:53.959
So, you told me that your wife
may have walked home from the--

30:53.994 --> 30:55.653
from the station, right?

30:55.688 --> 30:57.061
I mean so why would she--

30:57.096 --> 30:59.591
I didn't know, detec--
I didn't know.

30:59.626 --> 31:00.658
Why do you think
she would go there without you?

31:00.693 --> 31:02.066
That mean if she did,

31:02.101 --> 31:03.331
it would imply
maybe you had an argument.

31:03.366 --> 31:05.531
Yeah, it was a mistake,
it didn't make sense.

31:05.566 --> 31:07.335
I didn't know what to do.

31:07.370 --> 31:08.403
But she-- why would she do that
if you guys didn't have a fight?

31:08.438 --> 31:10.173
You know, I mean we always
can get a little hot,

31:10.208 --> 31:11.174
heated in the car.

31:11.209 --> 31:12.472
Why are we wasting time here?

31:12.507 --> 31:15.211
Like just--

31:16.412 --> 31:18.984
Look, there's been some tension.

31:22.220 --> 31:24.583
-My wife's an amazing woman.
-Okay.

31:24.618 --> 31:27.388
-Best woman I ever met.
-Mmhmm.

31:27.423 --> 31:28.653
But she has
a darkness inside her

31:28.688 --> 31:30.028
and sometimes...

31:32.461 --> 31:34.032
...she withdraws. I don't know.

31:34.067 --> 31:36.397
She's been there for me
through a lot of stuff and...

31:40.073 --> 31:41.171
now she's
goin' through some stuff.

31:41.206 --> 31:42.700
I'm just tryin'
to be there for her.

31:44.275 --> 31:46.308
Okay.

31:46.343 --> 31:47.474
Where do you live, Will?

31:49.247 --> 31:51.610
I live in Manchester,
New Hampshire.

31:53.416 --> 31:55.416
And what do you do for a living?

31:58.091 --> 32:00.454
I'm a real estate developer.

32:02.326 --> 32:03.996
There's lots of money
in real estate, right?

32:06.165 --> 32:08.462
-Lots of cash exchanges hands.
-Yeah.

32:08.497 --> 32:10.167
A lot of unsavory characters.

32:10.202 --> 32:12.367
Yeah, there's some,
but not at a gas station

32:12.402 --> 32:14.369
in Emerson.

32:14.404 --> 32:17.108
Disgruntled employees sometimes.

32:17.143 --> 32:19.143
-Disgruntled employees.
-No. I--

32:19.178 --> 32:20.573
Just like you know,

32:20.608 --> 32:21.673
they don't like the way
they've been treated,

32:21.708 --> 32:22.982
the way they've been paid.

32:26.251 --> 32:29.054
I'm a good boss, okay?

32:29.089 --> 32:32.585
I really don't see how
that going on in Manchester

32:32.620 --> 32:34.719
is gonna have
any fucking bearing

32:34.754 --> 32:36.127
in what is happening here in--

32:36.162 --> 32:37.689
You uh,
do a lot of work on the road?

32:37.724 --> 32:41.198
You go some prospecting,
so to speak, speculating?

32:41.233 --> 32:43.662
Looking at property,
lookin' at land?

32:43.697 --> 32:45.334
Takes you away from the city
a little bit?

32:45.369 --> 32:48.106
No, I don't leave so much.

32:48.141 --> 32:49.536
I work a lot,
I'm away from the house a lot.

32:49.571 --> 32:50.537
Work a lot--
away from the house.

32:50.572 --> 32:52.011
But I don't leave town
so much. No.

32:53.773 --> 32:55.410
All right, so now it's-- what?

32:55.445 --> 32:56.774
-- No, no, no.
-What? What?

32:59.449 --> 33:00.613
Have you ever had an affair?

33:02.617 --> 33:05.783
There's two guys
in here talkin', right?

33:05.818 --> 33:06.650
We all-- we all-- every--

33:06.686 --> 33:09.094
Every guy has a wandering eye,
right?

33:17.203 --> 33:19.302
No, I haven't had an affair.

33:19.337 --> 33:20.435
Has your wife?

33:26.245 --> 33:27.673
Yeah. Yeah.

33:32.416 --> 33:33.514
How long ago was that?

33:36.420 --> 33:37.815
Uh, it was about...

33:40.457 --> 33:41.720
six months ago.

33:44.395 --> 33:45.724
Do you have life insurance
on your wife?

33:50.368 --> 33:51.598
Yeah.

33:51.633 --> 33:53.864
How much?

33:53.899 --> 33:55.338
I don't know.

33:55.373 --> 33:56.372
A couple million.

33:58.607 --> 34:00.541
The standard, right?

34:00.576 --> 34:01.609
Well, no, I mean I--
I don't know.

34:01.644 --> 34:03.709
I make cop money,
I don't make development money.

34:03.744 --> 34:07.416
Okay, so I've abducted my wife
and I'm gonna kill her.

34:07.451 --> 34:09.451
I-- I'm gonna cash out
in a huge insurance policy.

34:09.486 --> 34:10.551
That's what this is all about?

34:10.586 --> 34:11.218
Well, okay,
that's what's happening.

34:11.254 --> 34:12.386
I gotta cover all the bases.

34:12.421 --> 34:15.325
No, my wife, right now, could be
three fucking states away

34:15.360 --> 34:16.722
and you're sitting in here
askin' me

34:16.757 --> 34:19.560
ben-fuckin'-ign questions

34:19.595 --> 34:22.497
that I've got nothing to do
with what has happened to her!

34:22.532 --> 34:24.598
Something drastic
has to happen here, Detective.

34:24.633 --> 34:26.138
I need your fucking help.

34:26.173 --> 34:27.733
Or should I just go
and do it myself?

34:30.672 --> 34:32.408
Why would I bring you
the evidence?

34:33.807 --> 34:35.741
You might be clever
than most people.

34:35.776 --> 34:38.282
-I don't know.
-Oh, Christ.

34:38.317 --> 34:39.778
-You're a smart man.
-- Yeah.

34:39.813 --> 34:42.187
Developer. Make a lot of money.

34:42.222 --> 34:43.650
Am I free to go?

34:43.685 --> 34:45.916
Anytime you want.

34:45.951 --> 34:47.720
We have your name,
we have your number,

34:47.755 --> 34:49.557
we'll be in touch.

34:49.592 --> 34:50.358
Do you have a photo
of your wife?

34:50.393 --> 34:51.823
Yeah,
I have a photo of my wife.

34:59.272 --> 35:00.766
Okay, be right back.

35:31.469 --> 35:33.964
I mean he looks suspicious
as hell, right?

35:33.999 --> 35:35.306
He seems
like a little wild card.

35:35.341 --> 35:36.340
I don't know.

35:36.375 --> 35:37.308
Mmhmm.

35:51.621 --> 35:52.818
<i>Morning, sleepyhead.</i>

35:53.854 --> 35:56.261
-What are you makin'?
-Well...

35:56.296 --> 35:57.856
Are you trying
to make breakfast?

35:59.827 --> 36:02.234
<i>Guess what I just got.</i>

36:02.269 --> 36:03.400
What?

36:03.435 --> 36:05.402
Remember Nate's contract
that I was up for?

36:05.437 --> 36:06.436
-Yeah.
-- The meeting I had.

36:06.471 --> 36:07.932
Mmhmm.

36:07.967 --> 36:09.439
I got the God job!

36:09.474 --> 36:10.803
-No, you didn't!
-I did!

36:10.838 --> 36:12.244
-Oh, my God!

36:16.778 --> 36:18.547
We got so much goin' for it.

36:18.582 --> 36:20.252
You just gotta look uh--
look, look, what we have!

36:20.287 --> 36:21.385
We have a beautiful life.

36:21.420 --> 36:22.716
I know we've been through shit,
but...

36:24.324 --> 36:25.554
we worked hard for this.

36:25.589 --> 36:29.294
I mean... we've got
some more gas in the tank.

36:53.518 --> 36:55.815
-Barry. Anna.
-Yeah, we're in here.

36:55.850 --> 36:56.816
You guys hear anything?

36:56.851 --> 36:58.719
-- Yes, no.
-- Yeah, yeah, right, no.

36:58.754 --> 37:00.523
-- You?
-Uh, the cops put out an APB.

37:00.558 --> 37:03.295
-Okay, I knew that.
-Okay.

37:03.330 --> 37:04.626
All right, so listen,
I found something.

37:04.661 --> 37:05.990
-I wanna show you guys.
-- Yeah.

37:06.025 --> 37:09.466
We got it off that CCTV camera.

37:09.501 --> 37:10.797
Okay, you know this guy?

37:10.832 --> 37:12.469
I can't really see very well
from here.

37:12.504 --> 37:14.471
Anna, do you see--
I can't see without my glasses.

37:14.506 --> 37:15.868
-- Hold on.
-- Um...

37:15.903 --> 37:16.869
-- You know him?
-That's hard to tell from here,

37:16.904 --> 37:18.376
but it looks a little bit like--

37:18.411 --> 37:19.509
-Oh yeah, that's Knuckles.
-A bit like--.

37:19.544 --> 37:20.972
-Yeah. He--
-That-- that's Knuckles.

37:21.007 --> 37:22.006
That's our handyman.

37:22.042 --> 37:23.274
-He's done some work around.
-He works for you?

37:23.310 --> 37:25.647
-No, he work-- does odd jobs.
-This guy looks like a creep.

37:25.682 --> 37:26.945
He's a friend of Lisa's.

37:26.980 --> 37:28.584
I mean they've known each other
since school.

37:28.619 --> 37:29.518
It's none-- and he--

37:29.554 --> 37:30.786
I wouldn't call him
a friend of Lisa's.

37:30.821 --> 37:32.753
-They knew each other when--
-Alright, g-- guys, okay, okay.

37:32.788 --> 37:35.019
So just--
does she know him enough

37:35.054 --> 37:36.427
to get in a car with him?

37:38.530 --> 37:39.958
I don't know.

37:39.993 --> 37:41.597
And do you think this guy
would do her any harm?

37:44.536 --> 37:46.536
Wait a minute. Can I see this?

37:46.571 --> 37:47.504
-- Is that his car?
-- Yeah, it's his car. Yeah.

37:47.539 --> 37:49.099
-I've seen this car.
-Really? I don't know.

37:49.134 --> 37:50.233
-Where did you see it?
-Yes. I did.

37:50.269 --> 37:52.674
I saw-- I saw it when I went up
to um, Archer Grove

37:52.709 --> 37:53.873
-for the-- the garage ser--
-Morrison?

37:53.908 --> 37:54.775
-Yes!
-Really?

37:54.810 --> 37:55.974
It was in the back.

37:56.009 --> 37:56.741
-All right.
-Uh, in the hangar things.

37:56.777 --> 37:57.709
Okay, good, good, good.

37:57.744 --> 37:58.944
Good, now is--
where's Morrison's, tell me.

37:58.979 --> 37:59.945
-It was right-- right there.

37:59.980 --> 38:02.019
Right, but so where--
Anna, just where is--

38:02.054 --> 38:02.553
I wasat the light bridge,
I stopped.

38:02.588 --> 38:03.916
Where is Morrison's?

38:18.603 --> 38:19.269
Paterson.

38:19.304 --> 38:21.703
Hey uh, detective, it's Will.

38:21.738 --> 38:23.507
I'm just checkin' in.

38:23.542 --> 38:25.575
See if you heard anything,
seen anything?

38:25.610 --> 38:26.910
Not yet, but we're on it.

38:26.945 --> 38:29.612
<i>Okay. All right.</i>
<i>Well, let me know if you do.</i>

38:29.647 --> 38:31.042
Of course.

38:31.077 --> 38:34.419
Oh, by the way,
I just wanna say sorry

38:34.454 --> 38:37.147
about before you know,
bein' sharp.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.886
<i>You're just doing your job,</i>
<i>I get it.</i>

38:39.921 --> 38:42.592
I-- I appreciate that.
So, what are you up to now?

38:42.627 --> 38:45.463
Oh, I'm just kinda
drivin' in circles

38:45.498 --> 38:48.895
around the edge of town,
gettin' nowhere.

38:48.930 --> 38:51.733
All right, well, um,
she turns up, give us a call.

38:51.768 --> 38:53.130
Yeah.

38:53.165 --> 38:55.033
I'll let you know
as soon as I hear anything.

38:57.741 --> 38:59.411
Same here. Bye.

39:00.909 --> 39:05.043
<i>In 12 miles take Exit 38</i>
<i>towards Archer Road.</i>

39:05.078 --> 39:06.110
Morrison's.

39:19.928 --> 39:23.699
<i>In 200 feet, your destination</i>
<i>is on the left.</i>

39:30.037 --> 39:31.135
<i>Arrived.</i>

41:13.074 --> 41:14.579
What the fuck.

41:32.159 --> 41:33.158
Come on!

41:35.767 --> 41:38.570
You fucking come on.

42:12.265 --> 42:13.231
Hey.

42:15.268 --> 42:16.300
What the fuck?

42:16.335 --> 42:19.039
You know who I am?
Where is she?

42:19.074 --> 42:20.876
Okay, look, uh, li-- listen,
wait, stop, stop.

42:20.911 --> 42:22.010
Hey, where the fuck is she?
Don't push me!

42:22.046 --> 42:23.747
I don't know --I don't know
who you're talkin' about.

42:23.782 --> 42:24.648
-- Who?
-Give me that shit.

42:24.683 --> 42:25.515
-- She who?
-Don't fuckin' b--

42:25.551 --> 42:27.751
My wife Lisa!
You know where she is.

42:27.786 --> 42:29.280
-Listen, you fucking calm down.
-- Tell me.

42:29.315 --> 42:31.084
-- Where the fuck is she?
-You fucking calm down.

42:31.119 --> 42:32.756
-- You calm down, just--
-Stay back, stay back.

42:32.791 --> 42:33.757
Just stay the fuck back.

42:33.792 --> 42:36.023
You're the one
that came in my fuckin' house.

42:36.058 --> 42:37.860
-Come on.
-Stop!

42:37.895 --> 42:38.993
-- Oh fuck!

42:39.028 --> 42:41.127
-Okay, stop! Stop, stop!

42:41.162 --> 42:43.063
I swear to God
I'll smash your fucking skull!

42:43.098 --> 42:44.295
Where the fuck is she?

43:04.823 --> 43:05.888
Okay.

43:11.929 --> 43:13.060
-Oh!

43:13.095 --> 43:14.160
Fuckin' talk to me!

43:14.195 --> 43:16.734
I didn't wanna leave her
with Frank.

43:16.769 --> 43:19.429
Right? He made me...

43:19.464 --> 43:20.738
Who's Frank?

43:21.873 --> 43:23.774
Tell me, you fuckin' prick.

43:59.240 --> 44:01.273
Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

44:04.377 --> 44:06.344
Stop. Oh, stop!

44:15.993 --> 44:17.894
I'll get you to Frank.

44:17.929 --> 44:21.095
She said she had a trailer.

44:21.130 --> 44:22.767
Where they sell.

44:22.802 --> 44:25.495
She's with Frank.

44:25.530 --> 44:27.805
I'll take you. I'll take you.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.973
Please, stop. Stop, stop.

45:11.378 --> 45:13.213
-No. No, no, no, no, no, no!
-Come here, you piece of shit.

45:16.119 --> 45:18.416
I'll take you to--

45:18.451 --> 45:20.253
I'll take you--

45:25.095 --> 45:27.062
I didn't wanna leave her.

45:27.097 --> 45:28.965
They made me leave her.

45:31.134 --> 45:34.267
Okay, I'll go.

45:34.302 --> 45:37.402
Just sto-- just hold it. No.

45:39.142 --> 45:42.440
Okay, okay. Uh, okay.

46:08.633 --> 46:10.039
Oscar!

46:14.243 --> 46:15.374
Where's Oscar?

46:15.409 --> 46:17.046
He worked earlier today.

46:17.081 --> 46:20.016
Well, listen, you tell him
he can call me at the station,

46:20.051 --> 46:21.611
come down see me at the station,
write me at the station,

46:21.646 --> 46:23.547
but he better come find me.

46:23.582 --> 46:25.582
If not, I'm comin' back
and I'm closing the place up.

46:25.617 --> 46:26.550
You understand?

46:47.606 --> 46:48.847
Shit.

47:03.061 --> 47:04.390
Just shut up, okay?

47:06.163 --> 47:08.064
Or you and I'll both be in jail.

47:24.577 --> 47:26.049
How you doin' today, sir?

47:26.084 --> 47:27.347
Good.

47:27.382 --> 47:29.151
You know why I stopped you?

47:29.186 --> 47:31.923
Yeah, I know I was--
I was speeding.

47:31.958 --> 47:35.421
A little fast. 82 on a 55.

47:35.456 --> 47:37.093
I get your license
and registration?

47:37.128 --> 47:40.195
Yeah, I was just in a bit of a--
you know, family emergency.

47:43.365 --> 47:44.661
Here you go.

47:44.696 --> 47:46.069
My-- uh.

47:49.536 --> 47:50.469
That's my--

47:53.210 --> 47:55.111
You don't live around here?

47:55.146 --> 47:57.146
-No, I live in Manchester.
-Mmhmm.

47:59.150 --> 48:00.347
You had some trouble today?

48:02.120 --> 48:05.088
Oh. That was uh...

48:05.123 --> 48:07.354
I was uh, j-- just
choppin' wood up at the cabin.

48:10.656 --> 48:11.930
I'll be right back.

48:20.567 --> 48:23.337
Shh! Fuck!

48:43.689 --> 48:45.392
Would you mind steppin'
out of the vehicle please?

48:48.100 --> 48:49.693
Why, officer?
It's just a traffic violation.

48:49.728 --> 48:51.398
Hey, just step
out of the vehicle for a minute.

48:51.433 --> 48:54.368
We'll get this over with
pretty quick.

48:54.403 --> 48:55.600
Sure. Yeah.

49:02.279 --> 49:03.178
Thank you.

49:03.214 --> 49:04.642
-Can you just uh--
-- Yeah.

49:04.677 --> 49:07.018
-Give me a ticket?
-- No.

49:07.053 --> 49:08.580
-I'm uh--
-You just step over there.

49:20.198 --> 49:22.528
Whose bags are these?

49:22.563 --> 49:23.595
My wife's.

49:26.204 --> 49:27.335
That's a lot of bags.

49:29.372 --> 49:31.339
Yeah, she likes her clothes.

49:33.541 --> 49:34.705
Where's your wife?

49:34.740 --> 49:36.080
Manchester.

49:55.629 --> 49:57.233
Do you mind poppin' the trunk
please?

49:59.237 --> 50:00.269
Sure.

50:05.309 --> 50:07.573
Hey, stop! Stop right there!

50:12.217 --> 50:13.579
Dispatch, this is 5-7.

50:13.614 --> 50:15.680
I need a 20. Repeat, the 20.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.835
Detective?

50:38.870 --> 50:39.836
Yeah.

50:42.610 --> 50:43.609
-- Thank you.
-You're welcome.

50:43.644 --> 50:45.413
Thanks.

50:45.448 --> 50:46.843
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

50:46.878 --> 50:48.251
I appreciate you guys
takin' the time.

50:48.286 --> 50:50.220
I just have to ask you
a few questions.

50:50.255 --> 50:51.320
Absolutely.

50:51.355 --> 50:52.717
Do you know a guy named "Clint"?

50:54.688 --> 50:58.129
Um, yeah,
it was the man Lisa was seeing.

50:58.164 --> 51:00.131
It was-- it was briefly.

51:00.166 --> 51:01.165
-- Yeah.
-It was like months ago.

51:01.200 --> 51:03.167
Yeah, that's what I figured.

51:03.202 --> 51:06.401
Um, do you think your son-in-law
was straying?

51:06.436 --> 51:07.567
No.

51:07.602 --> 51:09.338
No, that comes straight
from Lisa.

51:09.373 --> 51:11.472
He had nothing to do with that.

51:37.335 --> 51:38.468
We bypassed her password

51:38.503 --> 51:41.469
and we saw the last three emails
came from this Clint guy.

51:41.504 --> 51:43.240
-- Right.
-- He kept asking to see her.

51:43.275 --> 51:44.835
And did she answer his emails?

51:44.870 --> 51:46.837
Not once.

51:46.872 --> 51:49.444
Are you still seeing Clint?

51:49.479 --> 51:50.709
No.

51:50.744 --> 51:52.249
No, that was one night.

51:53.813 --> 51:54.912
I'm-- I'm alone, mom,

51:54.948 --> 51:57.650
and that is exactly what I want
for the time being.

52:08.498 --> 52:10.894
Yeah, you mean--

52:13.404 --> 52:14.203
You wanna be able to do

52:14.238 --> 52:17.208
what you wanna be able
to do again.

52:17.243 --> 52:21.542
so you have your break,
you have your fun,

52:21.577 --> 52:22.708
and I'll just go with it.

52:24.415 --> 52:26.547
He must be mad at you.

52:26.582 --> 52:27.911
he's not really the type
to get mad

52:27.946 --> 52:28.845
and you know that.

52:28.881 --> 52:31.255
Sweetheart,
I'm sorry I don't buy that.

52:34.392 --> 52:36.788
Fuck. Fuck!

52:49.275 --> 52:51.869
We contacted Boston PD,
that's where Clint lives now,

52:51.904 --> 52:53.904
and uh, we had some--
some tech people

52:53.939 --> 52:56.511
search all of his electronics
to see if he had hired anyone.

52:56.546 --> 53:00.746
They did a thorough search
and it came up unsuccessful.

53:00.781 --> 53:03.881
Now um, Knuckles knew
what Lisa looked like,

53:03.916 --> 53:05.817
because he saw the--
the pictures in your place.

53:05.852 --> 53:07.258
Is that right?

53:07.293 --> 53:08.490
Well, I mean he knew her
when they were kids,

53:08.525 --> 53:09.953
-they went to school together.
-Right.

53:09.988 --> 53:11.955
Okay.

53:11.990 --> 53:13.528
And you said
you saw Knuckles' car

53:13.563 --> 53:14.529
at the Morrison's, right?

53:14.564 --> 53:15.794
Yes, I drove by there
a couple of weeks ago

53:15.829 --> 53:17.334
and I saw it there.

53:17.369 --> 53:18.929
And then I-- I do remember
seeing it another time.

53:18.964 --> 53:22.273
I just-- I don't recall exactly
when that was.

53:22.308 --> 53:24.506
Doesn't matter,
I was there an hour ago.

53:24.541 --> 53:25.837
-And?
-And?

53:25.872 --> 53:27.575
His trailer's empty.

53:27.610 --> 53:30.677
Well, can you send a chopper,
survey the area?

53:30.712 --> 53:33.042
I mean they-- you can't let them
disappear like that.

53:33.077 --> 53:34.549
There's a suspect on the run.

53:34.584 --> 53:35.781
No, there is not.

53:35.816 --> 53:37.585
No, no, you--
well, how do you mean?

53:37.620 --> 53:39.356
Well, suspect of what?

53:39.391 --> 53:41.523
In all logic,
Lisa should be here now.

53:41.558 --> 53:43.393
She is not.

53:43.428 --> 53:44.691
That is all we know
at this junction.

53:44.726 --> 53:47.430
That, and she bumped
into your trusted handyman

53:47.465 --> 53:48.761
at the gas station.

53:48.796 --> 53:50.334
Technically, there's no crime.

54:46.953 --> 54:47.754
FRANK'-
Hey!

54:49.791 --> 54:50.955
You lookin' to get shot?

54:53.124 --> 54:55.091
No.

54:55.126 --> 54:56.598
Then why the fuck
you touchin' it?

54:59.064 --> 55:01.636
I don't know--
I just uh, thought--

55:01.671 --> 55:02.802
I don't know.

55:02.837 --> 55:03.869
What are you doin' here?

55:05.576 --> 55:08.940
FRANK'-
I'm lookin' for uh,
lookin' for Frank.

55:08.975 --> 55:10.513
Frank?

55:10.548 --> 55:11.613
Yeah, Frank.

55:11.648 --> 55:13.648
FRANK'-
Who sent you?

55:13.683 --> 55:15.782
Frank's a friend of mine.
I know him from Knuckles.

55:15.817 --> 55:17.916
Knuckles.

55:17.951 --> 55:19.390
How do you Knuckles?

55:19.425 --> 55:20.820
Does it fuckin' matter?

55:20.855 --> 55:22.624
I'm askin' a question.
Yeah, it fuckin' matters.

55:22.659 --> 55:25.154
Well, he's a friend of mine.
He works for my family.

55:25.189 --> 55:26.021
He introduced me to Frank.

55:26.057 --> 55:29.026
I'm here to do some business
with him.

55:29.061 --> 55:30.698
All right?

55:30.733 --> 55:32.469
Where you coming from?

55:33.868 --> 55:36.440
Coming from Emerson.

55:36.475 --> 55:37.573
Fuck you.

55:41.172 --> 55:42.512
Where's your car?

55:43.713 --> 55:44.811
Dude, it's crazy.

55:44.846 --> 55:46.879
My car broke down
like a couple of miles

55:46.914 --> 55:49.717
back down the road,
so I'm fuckin' late.

55:49.752 --> 55:50.518
You walkin' through those woods?

55:50.553 --> 55:51.620
Yeah, I'm walkin'
through the woods

55:51.655 --> 55:52.786
and Frank's waitin' for me.

55:52.821 --> 55:55.855
So, you wanna
let me get on my way?

55:55.890 --> 55:57.186
Frank didn't tell me anyone's
comin' this way.

55:57.221 --> 55:58.759
Well,
'cause Frank didn't fuckin' know

55:58.794 --> 55:59.958
I'd be runnin'
through the fuckin' woods.

55:59.993 --> 56:01.564
I'm supposed to be
drivin' there.

56:03.700 --> 56:05.029
Calm down, give me a second.

56:06.868 --> 56:07.801
Hey, Frank.

56:12.643 --> 56:13.708
FRANK'-
Frank, you copy?

56:18.176 --> 56:19.615
FRANK'-
You say your car broke down?

56:19.650 --> 56:22.178
Yeah, a couple of miles of back.

56:22.213 --> 56:23.146
Gave me a workout.

56:23.181 --> 56:25.555
Yeah, no fucking kidding.

56:25.590 --> 56:27.216
Frank, you copy?

56:27.251 --> 56:28.657
-You know what?

56:28.692 --> 56:31.594
Can we stop
fuckin' wasting time, eh?

56:31.629 --> 56:33.024
-You want--
-Hey.

56:33.059 --> 56:35.730
I'm just doin' my fucking job.

56:35.765 --> 56:37.666
Fuck's sake, man.

56:37.701 --> 56:39.833
You know what? I'll fuckin' go.

56:39.868 --> 56:41.472
The phone
not gonna work out here.

56:42.673 --> 56:44.134
Oh, fuck. I can't believe it.

56:44.169 --> 56:45.201
You don't think I would have
fuckin' called him?

56:45.236 --> 56:46.939
You know what?
Enough of this shit.

56:46.974 --> 56:48.479
How about the worst fucking day?

56:48.514 --> 56:51.207
Fucking car's broken down,
now you're stoppin' me.

56:51.242 --> 56:53.011
Why don't you explain to Frank
why this didn't happen,

56:53.046 --> 56:54.485
all right?

56:54.520 --> 56:55.585
Can't wait to see
what happens there.

56:55.620 --> 56:56.784
I'm fuckin' out.

57:00.955 --> 57:03.087
All right, hold the fuck up!

57:07.258 --> 57:08.928
Keep walkin' down that way.

57:08.963 --> 57:11.700
All right. Thanks.

57:14.606 --> 57:15.902
You better not be fuckin' me.

57:28.147 --> 57:30.015
Fuck you, motherfucker!

57:30.050 --> 57:31.984
-Uh, no.
-- Cool down, hey!

57:32.019 --> 57:32.820
-- No.
-- Fuck you, man.

57:32.855 --> 57:33.689
Get out of here.

57:33.724 --> 57:35.592
Oh, oh.

58:42.023 --> 58:43.660
Leave this.

59:16.420 --> 59:17.727
Is the truck fixed yet?

59:17.762 --> 59:18.926
Yeah, man, the truck's all good.

59:22.096 --> 59:23.667
Larry Barry.

59:23.702 --> 59:25.867
Hey, yo, get back to work.

59:25.902 --> 59:27.198
This is the second time
I asked you, man.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.336
Fuck.

59:33.371 --> 59:36.042
And so he just ran off
into the woods?

59:36.077 --> 59:38.308
<i>Yes, but we're in the process</i>
<i>of setting up a perimeter.</i>

59:38.343 --> 59:39.144
All right, thank you.

59:44.349 --> 59:45.755
Sergeant!

1:01:25.890 --> 1:01:27.021
What the--

1:01:54.149 --> 1:01:55.181
Come, Oscar.

1:01:58.483 --> 1:01:59.922
Hey!

1:02:04.863 --> 1:02:06.060
Yo, Oscar.

1:02:13.267 --> 1:02:14.530
Fuck.

1:02:45.497 --> 1:02:46.562
-- ...right back.

1:02:46.597 --> 1:02:47.497
All right, I'll be right back.

1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:56.341
Hey, clean this shit up.

1:02:56.376 --> 1:02:58.244
All right. Yeah, yeah,
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm--

1:04:09.053 --> 1:04:09.920
Get in it.

1:05:01.666 --> 1:05:03.303
Hey, man,
I told Robert about that.

1:05:15.746 --> 1:05:17.053
-Give me a minute with him.
-Mmhmm.

1:05:24.458 --> 1:05:27.261
Pete Daniels.

1:05:27.296 --> 1:05:28.295
That's your real name?

1:05:31.630 --> 1:05:34.565
-Unemployed?
-Fuck you, man.

1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:36.501
I fuckin' worked. Just--

1:05:36.536 --> 1:05:37.469
Recently?

1:05:37.504 --> 1:05:41.011
Yeah, I fuckin' worked recently.

1:05:41.046 --> 1:05:41.737
Where?

1:05:41.772 --> 1:05:43.541
Wherever fuckin' pays me, man.

1:05:43.576 --> 1:05:46.577
Uh, you know, put up a fence,
pull a fuckin' post, demo work.

1:05:46.612 --> 1:05:50.746
And sometimes you kidnap women
and hold 'em for ransom, right?

1:05:50.781 --> 1:05:52.088
Why are you fuckin'--

1:05:52.123 --> 1:05:53.716
Why are you grilling me
like this man?

1:05:53.751 --> 1:05:55.487
I'm the one that got attacked,
and tied up,

1:05:55.522 --> 1:05:57.357
and thrown in a fucking car!

1:05:57.392 --> 1:05:59.128
Why am I the fuckin' bad guy?

1:06:28.555 --> 1:06:30.291
Here's what I'm gonna do
for you.

1:06:31.093 --> 1:06:33.558
You tell me where Lisa is
and I'll walk in the court

1:06:33.593 --> 1:06:36.792
and I'll tell them
how cooperative you've been.

1:06:36.827 --> 1:06:39.300
I'll sing your praises
to the rooftops.

1:06:39.769 --> 1:06:42.138
And I bet
if Will gets his wife back

1:06:42.173 --> 1:06:43.337
and the Adams
get their daughter back,

1:06:43.372 --> 1:06:45.405
I can convince them
not to press charges.

1:06:45.440 --> 1:06:47.308
Fuck you, man,
I ain't no stupid.

1:06:47.343 --> 1:06:49.178
I know
you can't promise me shit.

1:06:49.213 --> 1:06:50.575
I'm just telling you
what I may be able to do

1:06:50.610 --> 1:06:51.708
to help you out.

1:07:19.903 --> 1:07:21.474
How did you get her
into your car?

1:07:23.709 --> 1:07:26.116
Who said I fuckin' did, huh?

1:07:26.151 --> 1:07:27.183
You didn't?

1:07:33.257 --> 1:07:34.355
I don't recall.

1:07:35.124 --> 1:07:38.194
You're on footage
talking to Lisa,

1:07:38.229 --> 1:07:39.327
but you forgot.

1:07:39.796 --> 1:07:41.494
Hey, uh, excuse me.

1:07:41.529 --> 1:07:43.232
Lisa. Lisa Adams!

1:07:44.499 --> 1:07:46.466
-Pete, hi.
-Knuckles.

1:07:46.501 --> 1:07:48.600
-Right, hi, how are you?
-I'm good. How're you?

1:07:48.635 --> 1:07:50.404
I know-- I--
I heard you were coming back.

1:07:50.439 --> 1:07:52.208
-Yeah. Yeah, that's--
-- Yeah.

1:07:52.243 --> 1:07:55.607
I-- I'm doin' some work uh, uh,
up at um, at-- at your--

1:07:55.642 --> 1:07:57.609
your parents' house on the room.

1:07:57.644 --> 1:07:59.281
-Oh, that's you! Okay.
-- Yeah, yeah.

1:07:59.316 --> 1:08:00.447
-They're so happy with it.
-- Oh yeah.

1:08:00.482 --> 1:08:01.548
-I can't wait to see it.
-Good.

1:08:01.583 --> 1:08:03.450
Are you-- are you--
are you headin' there right now?

1:08:03.485 --> 1:08:04.484
-- Yeah. Yeah.
-Are you?

1:08:04.519 --> 1:08:05.683
Could you do me a favor?

1:08:05.718 --> 1:08:07.619
Could you uh, bring an invoice
that I got?

1:08:07.654 --> 1:08:09.390
Sure.

1:08:09.425 --> 1:08:09.957
Just a little something,
drop off for your pops.

1:08:09.992 --> 1:08:10.925
-Okay.
-Real quick.

1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:13.394
-- Yeah, no problem.
-Who you here with?

1:08:13.429 --> 1:08:14.593
-- Oh, my husband.
-Oh.

1:08:14.628 --> 1:08:15.427
Yeah.

1:08:15.462 --> 1:08:16.760
You look really great,
by the way.

1:08:16.795 --> 1:08:17.627
-Thanks, thanks.
-Yeah.

1:08:17.663 --> 1:08:19.499
You have to tell your mom
I said "hi."

1:08:19.534 --> 1:08:21.237
I haven't seen her for uh--
Shut the fuck up.

1:08:21.272 --> 1:08:22.832
-Get in the fuckin' car.

1:08:22.867 --> 1:08:25.736
Don't be stupid, just get in.
Get in the fuckin' car.

1:08:32.580 --> 1:08:34.679
You're on tape
talking to her

1:08:34.714 --> 1:08:35.911
right before she disappeared

1:08:35.946 --> 1:08:37.682
and no one's seen her alive
since.

1:08:37.717 --> 1:08:39.321
Yeah,
so I fuckin' talked to her, man.

1:08:39.356 --> 1:08:41.653
Big fuckin' deal, all right?
I knew her.

1:08:41.688 --> 1:08:43.358
I was workin'
at her fuckin' parents' house.

1:09:25.996 --> 1:09:28.238
-You just keep an eye on him.
-Damn, man.

1:09:28.273 --> 1:09:30.240
Close to maybe two days,
I gotta fix the shit.

1:10:05.805 --> 1:10:07.607
I think it's inside the kitchen.

1:10:07.642 --> 1:10:10.038
Inside. You got the key?

1:10:10.073 --> 1:10:11.006
I don't have the key, man.

1:10:11.041 --> 1:10:13.415
-- Shit.

1:10:14.518 --> 1:10:15.714
Okay, I'll go back to the house
and get the key.

1:10:15.749 --> 1:10:17.551
-Whoa, whoa.
-Oh, shit.

1:10:17.586 --> 1:10:18.418
-The hell, man?
-Watch your hands.

1:10:18.454 --> 1:10:20.422
-Watch your hands.
-- All right.

1:10:20.757 --> 1:10:21.786
-- Back up.
-Yeah, calm down, man.

1:10:21.821 --> 1:10:22.721
-- Back up.
-Whoa, whoa!

1:10:22.756 --> 1:10:23.755
-Hey.
-What the fuck?

1:10:24.758 --> 1:10:26.593
Just tell me where she is, okay?

1:10:26.628 --> 1:10:29.563
-Where who is?
-My wife. Lisa!

1:10:29.598 --> 1:10:31.334
Tell me where Lisa is.

1:10:31.703 --> 1:10:32.863
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

1:10:32.898 --> 1:10:35.030
Calm down, man. Be easy.

1:10:35.065 --> 1:10:38.539
Please, please.
Tell me, all right?

1:10:39.475 --> 1:10:40.674
I don't care what you guys
are doin' here,

1:10:40.709 --> 1:10:44.512
I just wanna know where she is
and I will get out of here.

1:10:44.547 --> 1:10:45.777
No police, no nothing,

1:10:45.812 --> 1:10:46.976
but just tell me
where she fuckin' is!

1:10:47.011 --> 1:10:48.417
Know what we do here?
We don't have--

1:10:48.452 --> 1:10:51.013
So, please tell me.
I just want my wife back.

1:10:51.048 --> 1:10:53.488
-Just put the gun down, bro.
-Knuckles told me!

1:10:53.523 --> 1:10:56.051
I know who you are!
Please.

1:10:56.086 --> 1:10:58.394
Please just tell me
where she is.

1:10:58.429 --> 1:10:59.857
I don't know any Knuckles, man.

1:11:01.564 --> 1:11:02.860
Fuck.

1:11:02.895 --> 1:11:04.961
Okay, open that door,
let me see what's inside.

1:11:04.996 --> 1:11:06.765
-You wanna see what's in here?
-I swear to God,

1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:09.339
I will shoot you
in the fuckin' face.

1:11:09.374 --> 1:11:10.439
All right.

1:11:11.541 --> 1:11:12.672
Open the door, Larry.

1:11:12.707 --> 1:11:14.476
All right, calm down, man.

1:11:14.511 --> 1:11:16.577
- All right. Let
me see what's in there.

1:11:16.612 --> 1:11:18.381
-Easy with that, man.
-Open the door.

1:11:18.416 --> 1:11:19.679
Let him take a look.

1:11:21.617 --> 1:11:22.748
Okay.

1:11:27.491 --> 1:11:29.491
-Good, man.
-Shut the fuck up.

1:11:35.961 --> 1:11:37.730
Easy. Easy.

1:11:37.765 --> 1:11:39.468
I'm good, I'm good.

1:11:39.503 --> 1:11:40.931
-- Fuck.

1:11:45.069 --> 1:11:46.068
Shit.

1:11:48.710 --> 1:11:49.940
Fuck with me, you fucking--

1:11:52.648 --> 1:11:54.549
You're fucked up now, dude!

1:11:56.113 --> 1:11:58.916
- I got you!
You're boxed in!

1:12:00.557 --> 1:12:02.920
-Where are you gonna go?

1:12:14.802 --> 1:12:16.967
-- Shit.

1:12:20.643 --> 1:12:22.478
-Just tell me w--

1:12:28.013 --> 1:12:29.111
Fuck!

1:13:45.695 --> 1:13:46.496
Shit.

1:14:47.988 --> 1:14:50.021
Fuck. Fuck.

1:14:50.859 --> 1:14:52.089
Come on!

1:14:52.696 --> 1:14:53.926
Fuck!

1:15:38.137 --> 1:15:40.104
Go on. Fuck off.

1:15:40.139 --> 1:15:41.611
Hey, you guys, go.

1:15:42.812 --> 1:15:43.910
Go home.

1:16:05.098 --> 1:16:06.262
I'm sorry, Will.

1:16:09.740 --> 1:16:12.037
Can you please
just understand this?

1:16:12.072 --> 1:16:13.676
I don't wanna be like this
I don't wanna resent you

1:16:13.711 --> 1:16:15.205
and I don't want you
to resent me.

1:16:16.813 --> 1:16:18.780
-You're my best friend.
-- Oh.

1:16:18.815 --> 1:16:20.342
You're my favorite human.

1:16:20.377 --> 1:16:22.047
-What?
-Yeah.

1:16:22.082 --> 1:16:23.917
Out of all the humans,
you're my favorite.

1:16:25.151 --> 1:16:26.315
I love you, babe.

1:16:36.965 --> 1:16:38.866
Hey, get out of here! Go.

1:16:41.937 --> 1:16:43.134
Go, get lost.

1:16:44.775 --> 1:16:45.972
-- Lisa?

1:16:48.977 --> 1:16:50.911
You must be
the dumbest motherfucker alive.

1:16:51.313 --> 1:16:53.309
You kidnapped a woman
in broad daylight

1:16:53.344 --> 1:16:55.146
and think nobody saw that shit?

1:16:55.181 --> 1:16:58.116
You're doin' life!
You're doin' life.

1:16:59.218 --> 1:17:00.250
<i>Lisa!</i>

1:17:00.285 --> 1:17:01.922
So, tell me where she is.

1:17:02.291 --> 1:17:05.728
Lisa! Lisa?

1:17:05.763 --> 1:17:08.258
I'm gonna make you feel so good.

1:17:08.293 --> 1:17:11.833
J-- just tell me where she is.

1:17:13.870 --> 1:17:16.332
-Where is she?
-She's fuckin' dead, man.

1:17:24.177 --> 1:17:26.881
She's fuckin' dead.

1:17:35.958 --> 1:17:37.023
You killed her?

1:17:40.996 --> 1:17:41.764
Hey.

1:17:43.229 --> 1:17:44.866
What the fuck?

1:17:47.035 --> 1:17:48.100
Fuck.

1:17:53.041 --> 1:17:54.843
I'm right in knowin'
I'd see you here.

1:17:56.044 --> 1:17:57.846
Yeah, everybody
does a little meth, right?

1:17:58.582 --> 1:18:00.178
I mean
that's easy fuckin' money.

1:18:01.313 --> 1:18:03.247
All right,
what about kidnappin', huh?

1:18:03.282 --> 1:18:05.920
-Is that good money?
-Fuck that.

1:18:05.955 --> 1:18:08.824
-I didn't kidnap anybody.
-You're so full of shit.

1:18:12.225 --> 1:18:13.422
You're not fuckin' kill me?
What are you gonna do?

1:18:13.457 --> 1:18:15.831
You're gonna fuckin' kill me,
huh?

1:18:15.866 --> 1:18:17.228
You might wanna ask Frank that.

1:18:18.429 --> 1:18:19.329
Eh?

1:18:19.731 --> 1:18:21.331
You're not a fucking killer
either.

1:18:23.533 --> 1:18:26.072
All right, put the gun down.
Lower it.

1:18:26.107 --> 1:18:29.339
You put the fucking gun down!
You put it down!

1:18:32.575 --> 1:18:33.849
All right.

1:18:39.219 --> 1:18:40.482
Okay, talk to me.

1:18:41.318 --> 1:18:43.925
I think it's fucking crazy
you care so much about your wife

1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:46.158
when she's gettin' ready
to leave your ass.

1:18:46.193 --> 1:18:48.127
I mean, but that's divorce
for you, though, right?

1:18:48.162 --> 1:18:49.425
It's like gettin' fucked twice.

1:18:49.460 --> 1:18:51.559
How you know
about the divorce, huh?

1:18:51.594 --> 1:18:53.396
if you're not involved
in the kidnappin'?

1:18:53.431 --> 1:18:56.806
Knuckles. Yeah, Knuckles.

1:18:56.841 --> 1:18:58.038
Listen,
that's not the fucking point.

1:18:58.073 --> 1:19:00.843
The point is that I know
where the fuck she is.

1:19:00.878 --> 1:19:03.439
All right, where is she?
Tell me where she is!

1:19:05.014 --> 1:19:06.079
She alive?

1:19:07.181 --> 1:19:09.049
-Is she alive?
-20,000.

1:19:11.053 --> 1:19:13.020
Okay, 20,000
and I will fuckin' tell you--

1:19:13.055 --> 1:19:14.483
-You're a lying piece of shit.
-Everything you need to know.

1:19:14.518 --> 1:19:16.155
I don't believe you!

1:19:16.190 --> 1:19:17.860
Tell me where she is.
Show me her!

1:19:19.864 --> 1:19:20.863
Hey, prove it!

1:19:23.296 --> 1:19:24.097
Huh?

1:19:25.562 --> 1:19:27.265
It's her fuckin' phone, right?

1:19:31.975 --> 1:19:33.942
Right, that's her phone, right?
That's her phone, right?

1:19:36.111 --> 1:19:37.143
-- Yeah.
-You prick!

1:19:37.178 --> 1:19:38.309
-- Okay.
-You fiuckin' prick.

1:19:38.344 --> 1:19:39.176
Okay, now we're talkin', right?

1:19:39.212 --> 1:19:40.982
-Yeah.
-- Yeah, now we're talkin'.

1:19:41.017 --> 1:19:42.852
-Yeah, now we're talkin'.
-You think I didn't see her?

1:19:42.887 --> 1:19:44.513
I saw her when she bought
that bottle of water.

1:19:44.548 --> 1:19:46.218
Yeah, I saw her.

1:19:47.551 --> 1:19:50.189
Come on.
$20,000 and I will tell you.

1:19:51.621 --> 1:19:52.422
Huh?

1:19:54.558 --> 1:20:00.100
All right, I'll give you 20,000.
Oh, my ball's in your court.

1:20:00.135 --> 1:20:02.036
-I'll give you the money.
-Okay.

1:20:03.369 --> 1:20:05.501
Okay,
how am I gonna get the money?

1:20:05.536 --> 1:20:06.469
-How am I gonna get the money?
-I'm gonna go--

1:20:07.912 --> 1:20:09.637
No, fuck that!
I want the money right now!

1:20:09.672 --> 1:20:10.538
20,000 and I will get you--

1:20:10.573 --> 1:20:12.541
I'll give you the money,
just get me Lisa.

1:20:12.576 --> 1:20:14.917
-I wanna see her.
-I'm coming with you.

1:20:14.952 --> 1:20:16.919
-I'm coming with you!
-You're not comin' with me!

1:20:16.954 --> 1:20:18.481
I'm coming with you! I think
you're gonna call the cops!

1:20:18.516 --> 1:20:20.087
Let me see her!
Let me see my fuckin' wife!

1:20:50.988 --> 1:20:52.251
And how do you know she's dead?

1:20:53.386 --> 1:20:55.254
How do you know she's dead?

1:20:55.689 --> 1:20:58.554
-How do you know she's dead?
-Because I dug the fucking hole!

1:21:03.693 --> 1:21:06.001
A couple of weeks ago, I was--

1:21:06.036 --> 1:21:08.333
I was just talking shit
with Frank.

1:21:08.368 --> 1:21:10.533
I was just fuckin' around
about how this--

1:21:10.568 --> 1:21:13.437
This fuckin' girl I knew
was coming back.

1:21:13.472 --> 1:21:15.439
She married
this fuckin' rich dude

1:21:15.474 --> 1:21:17.309
and we could get a shit ton
of money

1:21:17.344 --> 1:21:18.574
if we snatched her, you know?

1:21:18.609 --> 1:21:20.609
He'd wanna get her back,
you know?

1:21:24.186 --> 1:21:26.087
I wasn't fuckin'
thinkin' straight.

1:21:27.123 --> 1:21:28.287
It was fuckin' stupid, man.

1:21:28.322 --> 1:21:29.651
I saw her
at the fucking gas station.

1:21:29.686 --> 1:21:31.653
I just fuckin' snatched her.

1:21:31.688 --> 1:21:33.226
And then I--
I took her to Frank.

1:21:33.261 --> 1:21:37.329
I took her to Frank.
He got so fuckin' mad, man.

1:21:37.364 --> 1:21:40.200
He was so fuckin' pissed off
that I took her there,

1:21:40.235 --> 1:21:42.433
'cause he knew-- he knew
there were fuckin' cameras.

1:21:42.468 --> 1:21:44.534
That they fuckin' saw me.

1:21:44.569 --> 1:21:47.141
And Frank wouldn't let me leave
with her alive.

1:21:49.244 --> 1:21:51.079
He said
I had to dig a fucking hole

1:21:51.114 --> 1:21:52.344
and put her in it.

1:21:53.743 --> 1:21:55.743
I was diggin' the hole,

1:21:55.778 --> 1:21:57.987
but I knew Frank
was gonna put me in it, too,

1:21:58.022 --> 1:22:00.550
so I fuckin' ran.

1:22:00.585 --> 1:22:02.992
I didn't wanna hurt her.

1:22:03.027 --> 1:22:04.191
Where's the hole?

1:22:05.590 --> 1:22:08.756
-Where is the fucking hole?
-At Frank's house.

1:22:08.791 --> 1:22:09.999
Up in Beckley.

1:22:11.662 --> 1:22:14.366
I swear to God,
I just wanted the fuckin' money.

1:22:25.214 --> 1:22:27.049
Jesus, fucking.

1:22:48.303 --> 1:22:50.039
Hey, turn that off.

1:23:13.757 --> 1:23:15.361
Drivin' in circles, huh?

1:23:19.169 --> 1:23:20.597
We found Knuckles in your trunk.

1:23:25.802 --> 1:23:27.175
I'm under arrest?

1:23:29.410 --> 1:23:30.706
Stay put.

1:24:58.565 --> 1:24:59.333
Hmm.

1:25:14.614 --> 1:25:17.582
Lisa? Lisa!

1:25:18.948 --> 1:25:21.190
-Lisa?

1:25:21.225 --> 1:25:23.390
-What the fuck.

1:25:23.425 --> 1:25:26.228
-Okay, I'm comin'.

1:25:31.367 --> 1:25:34.302
Lisa. Oh shit, baby.

1:25:42.279 --> 1:25:43.905
What the fuck? It's okay.

1:25:44.941 --> 1:25:46.512
-It's okay.

1:25:46.547 --> 1:25:47.942
Oh, it's okay, baby.

1:25:50.012 --> 1:25:51.616
I got you.

1:25:53.752 --> 1:25:56.225
-It's okay.

1:25:58.295 --> 1:25:59.459
You're okay, see.

1:26:01.595 --> 1:26:03.628
-It's okay, it's okay.

1:26:03.663 --> 1:26:07.401
Will, please,
get me out of here please.

1:26:09.405 --> 1:26:10.668
Okay, come.

1:26:24.288 --> 1:26:26.915
-I got you.
-- Okay.

1:27:11.599 --> 1:27:13.467
As I figured,
couldn't stand the guilt.

1:27:14.899 --> 1:27:17.064
Knuckles signed the confession,

1:27:17.099 --> 1:27:19.737
but he still blames everything
on Frank, by the way.

1:27:19.772 --> 1:27:21.772
But who the fuck knows?

1:27:21.807 --> 1:27:23.411
I think
Oscar caught him in the act

1:27:23.446 --> 1:27:25.644
and tried to push himself
into the ransom money.

1:27:27.351 --> 1:27:28.416
Wow.

1:27:29.352 --> 1:27:31.485
Look at some real salts
of the earth there, huh?

1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:33.421
One could say that.

1:27:35.656 --> 1:27:37.359
By the way uh,

1:27:37.394 --> 1:27:39.658
we inspected
some of the remains.

1:27:39.693 --> 1:27:41.088
Not all of them died
in the explosions,

1:27:41.123 --> 1:27:42.859
there were some shots exchanged.

1:27:49.373 --> 1:27:53.903
I said to myself,
"Hey, you lived by the sword."

1:28:03.046 --> 1:28:05.552
-Thank you.
-Take care of yourself.

1:28:28.709 --> 1:28:30.577
Can you um, give us a minute?

1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:41.115
-Hi.
-- Hey.

1:28:49.829 --> 1:28:51.466
-Good?
-Yeah.

1:28:53.701 --> 1:28:54.931
Come with me.

1:28:58.871 --> 1:29:01.443
-Yeah.
