00:19.803 --> 00:21.304
Open up, babies.

00:21.305 --> 00:22.905
Time for breakfast.

00:22.906 --> 00:24.073
Who wants Mommy's sausage?

00:24.074 --> 00:25.341
None for me,
thanks.

00:25.342 --> 00:26.509
No sausage?

00:26.510 --> 00:27.710
What's wrong, sweetie?

00:27.744 --> 00:30.346
Today's the day I'm going to ask Jimmy Jr.
to the dance.

00:30.347 --> 00:31.781
I don't want
sausage sweats.

00:31.815 --> 00:33.316
Why?

00:33.317 --> 00:34.884
I'm wearing my
sausage sweats right now.

00:34.885 --> 00:37.153
Aw, my baby's going
to her first school dance.

00:37.187 --> 00:39.833
It's not that big a deal.
I never went to a school dance.

00:39.834 --> 00:41.991
What? You never went
to a school dance?

00:41.992 --> 00:43.559
No, I had
other things to do.

00:43.594 --> 00:44.861
Like what, Dad?
Well, I did leather-tooling.

00:44.895 --> 00:46.629
I made a belt.

00:46.663 --> 00:48.831
Somebody change the subject,
somebody change the subject!

00:48.866 --> 00:50.032
Hey, I'm
fine with it.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.234
I didn't
miss out on dances.

00:51.235 --> 00:53.569
Those other kids
missed out on leather.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.071
Aw, Bobby.

00:55.072 --> 00:56.405
That's what
I love about you:

00:56.406 --> 00:57.573
all your sad stories.

00:57.574 --> 00:58.708
It's not sad.

00:58.709 --> 01:00.343
Hush, you're
scaring Tina.

01:00.344 --> 01:02.511
Put that out of your head
before you ask Jimmy Jr.

01:02.512 --> 01:03.713
Happy thoughts,
happy thoughts.

01:03.747 --> 01:05.047
Leather belts.

01:05.048 --> 01:06.082
Sausage.

01:06.083 --> 01:07.416
Sausage belts.

01:07.417 --> 01:08.851
That's a great idea.

01:10.454 --> 01:13.089
Hi, Jimmy Jr.
Oh, hey, Tina.

01:13.090 --> 01:15.558
Did you see those two squirrels
fighting in the courtyard?

01:15.559 --> 01:17.693
Hey, speaking of the dance,
are you planning on going?

01:17.728 --> 01:19.395
Am I going to the dance?

01:19.396 --> 01:22.231
Does this answer
your question? Pyeah!

01:22.232 --> 01:24.634
- Oh, that must be dancing for "yes."
- Yeah.

01:24.635 --> 01:27.103
Then, would you like to
go to the dance with me?

01:27.104 --> 01:29.438
Uh, the best I can
do now is a maybe.

01:29.439 --> 01:31.207
I want to know what
all my options are first.

01:31.241 --> 01:32.508
That makes sense.
Yeah, it does.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.769
- Because, why tie yourself down now?
- Yeah.

01:34.770 --> 01:37.392
You know, you want to know all the girls
that might be interested

01:37.393 --> 01:38.481
- so you could weigh...
- Right.

01:38.482 --> 01:40.116
the pro... weigh them
against each other.

01:40.117 --> 01:41.150
Okay, see you later.

01:41.151 --> 01:42.218
Okay, bye.

01:42.219 --> 01:43.286
Hey, Tina.
Yeah?

01:43.287 --> 01:44.487
Ch-ah.

01:44.770 --> 01:45.988
What's that
dancing for?

01:45.989 --> 01:47.657
Just... your skirt's
stuck in your underwear.

01:47.658 --> 01:48.958
Oh, thanks
for telling me.

01:48.959 --> 01:51.093
- All right, fix it.
- Okay.

01:51.094 --> 01:53.362
â™ª

01:53.397 --> 01:56.465
â™ª I'm gonna live forever

01:56.500 --> 02:00.069
â™ª I'm gonna learn
how to fly... â™ª

02:00.103 --> 02:01.370
Oh, my God.

02:01.405 --> 02:03.139
Tina?
Josh?

02:03.140 --> 02:05.007
What are you doing here?
I'm here for school.

02:05.008 --> 02:06.721
This is homework for
my street performance class.

02:06.722 --> 02:08.911
- Wow.
- I go to the performing arts high school.

02:08.912 --> 02:10.079
I dance ballet.

02:10.113 --> 02:11.647
Oh, a bad boy.
Cool.

02:11.682 --> 02:13.015
Who's this?

02:13.016 --> 02:14.116
I hope she's not another
Toe 'Ho.

02:14.117 --> 02:15.718
A what
Douglas.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.153
A dance groupie.

02:17.154 --> 02:18.721
These hangers-on, they
really sap your energy.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.556
No, Douglas,
this is Tina.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.791
I never thought
I'd see her again.

02:21.825 --> 02:22.892
Oh, great.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.460
Hey, hey, Josh.

02:24.461 --> 02:26.395
I have to do a minute of
handstands for extra credit.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.730
Can you time me?

02:27.731 --> 02:29.131
No, I'm-I'm
kind of busy right now.

02:29.132 --> 02:30.566
I guess I'll just time
myself, then.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.194
One, two, three,

02:32.360 --> 02:34.070
- four, five, six...
- I haven't seen you since...

02:34.104 --> 02:35.771
- Douglas, you got to stop, buddy, okay?
- Okay.

02:35.772 --> 02:37.407
I'm so sorry, Tina.
What were you saying?

02:37.441 --> 02:39.642
- I haven't seen you since...
- Since we kissed.

02:39.643 --> 02:42.011
On either side of the
dairy case at Fresh Feed.

02:42.012 --> 02:43.112
It was hot.
And cold.

02:43.113 --> 02:44.246
Why didn't you call me?

02:44.247 --> 02:45.748
No, I wrote down
your number, but I

02:45.749 --> 02:47.667
put it in my dance pants
and it got all sweaty.

02:47.684 --> 02:49.819
Dance pants.
Yeah.

02:49.820 --> 02:52.018
- Never put anything down dance pants.
- Mmm.

02:52.019 --> 02:53.689
Hey, I was just thinking,
our school dance is Saturday.

02:53.690 --> 02:55.424
Will you
come with me?

02:55.425 --> 02:57.093
Don't you want to know
what your other options are?

02:57.127 --> 02:58.794
No, silly,
I want to go with you.

02:58.829 --> 03:02.031
Well, that sounds fun, but my
school dance is on Saturday, too,

03:02.032 --> 03:04.533
and today I got a soft
maybe from a boy I asked.

03:04.534 --> 03:06.435
So... I'll have
to let you know?

03:06.470 --> 03:08.304
That's totally fair.
Here's my number.

03:08.338 --> 03:09.815
Oops, I lost it.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.375
I know you're kidding.

03:12.376 --> 03:13.676
Yep, that's
our chemistry.

03:13.677 --> 03:14.867
It sure is.

03:14.868 --> 03:15.845
Really cool
chemistry, too.

03:15.846 --> 03:16.846
Douglas, please!

03:18.515 --> 03:21.017
Oh, I recognize
that look.

03:21.051 --> 03:22.918
Somebody's going to
the dance with Jimmy Jr.

03:22.919 --> 03:24.387
Yes, and it
might be me.

03:24.388 --> 03:25.621
Jimmy Jr. gave
me a maybe.

03:25.655 --> 03:26.856
All right!

03:26.857 --> 03:28.591
That's my
little maybe baby.

03:28.592 --> 03:30.860
You're gonna be the prettiest
girl at the dance, maybe.

03:30.894 --> 03:32.261
Just a maybe?

03:32.262 --> 03:33.529
When's he gonna give you
a solid answer?

03:33.563 --> 03:34.597
Soon, I hope.

03:34.598 --> 03:37.233
Because Josh asked me to go
to his school dance, too.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.734
Well, that's great.

03:38.735 --> 03:40.169
Go with the kid
who's not stringing you along.

03:40.203 --> 03:42.038
Remember, Tina,
a nerd in the hand is worth...

03:42.039 --> 03:43.205
not really
that much, actually.

03:43.206 --> 03:44.540
Never mind.

03:44.574 --> 03:46.709
A yes is better than
a maybe, sweetie.

03:46.710 --> 03:48.210
Don't end up
like your father.

03:48.211 --> 03:49.412
Uh, what?

03:49.413 --> 03:50.746
Don't end up
like your father.

03:50.781 --> 03:52.181
I guess you're right.

03:52.182 --> 03:54.016
But, I've logged
over 3,000 fantasy hours

03:54.017 --> 03:55.618
on my relationship
with Jimmy Jr.

03:55.619 --> 03:57.153
You don't just throw that away.

03:57.187 --> 03:59.055
Bob's Burgers. Hello?

03:59.056 --> 04:00.089
We can do it?

04:00.090 --> 04:01.590
Yay. Oh, how exciting.

04:01.591 --> 04:04.260
No teens are gonna
get pregnant on our watch.

04:04.294 --> 04:05.528
I'll see you Saturday.

04:05.529 --> 04:06.695
Uh, what was
all that?

04:06.730 --> 04:08.364
Get ready to
shake it, Bobby.

04:08.365 --> 04:09.565
We're gonna chaperone
Tina's dance.

04:09.566 --> 04:10.833
Narc!

04:10.867 --> 04:12.668
Chaperone?
That's a horrible idea.

04:12.702 --> 04:14.103
Dad, your first dance.

04:14.104 --> 04:15.204
We can get ready together.

04:15.205 --> 04:16.572
Yeah, you can
zip each other up.

04:16.606 --> 04:18.307
Uh...

04:18.308 --> 04:20.076
Hi, Jimmy Jr.

04:20.077 --> 04:21.610
I was wondering
if you've decided

04:21.611 --> 04:23.079
who you're going
to the dance with.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.147
Uh, no offense, Tina,
but you're pressuring me

04:25.148 --> 04:26.975
right now, and guys
don't like that.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.552
Well, then, maybe I'll go with
the other boy who asked me.

04:29.553 --> 04:30.986
Wha...? Another boy?

04:30.987 --> 04:32.121
Oh, uh...
I just decided.

04:32.122 --> 04:33.607
I'll go with you.

04:33.623 --> 04:36.092
Wait, you just decided
you'll go with me

04:36.093 --> 04:38.127
because you found out
this other boy wants to?

04:38.161 --> 04:39.562
That has nothing
to do with it.

04:39.563 --> 04:41.464
Who is it? Lenny?
No.

04:41.465 --> 04:43.599
I mean, he's good-looking,
but he's not that good-looking.

04:43.633 --> 04:45.101
Plus, looks fade.

04:45.102 --> 04:46.502
It's not Lenny.
Was it Nate?

04:46.503 --> 04:48.137
No.
'Cause he has herpes.

04:48.138 --> 04:50.906
- So you're saying you want to go with me?
- Yes.

04:50.941 --> 04:53.109
And Josh wants to go with me.

04:53.110 --> 04:54.143
Choose me, Tina.

04:54.144 --> 04:55.244
I asked you first.

04:55.245 --> 04:56.846
But you asked
me first.

04:56.847 --> 04:58.280
We've got chemistry.

04:58.281 --> 04:59.615
I've got a butt.

04:59.616 --> 05:00.616
Look at it.

05:00.617 --> 05:02.151
I asked you
and only you.

05:02.152 --> 05:03.652
- As far as you know.
- What?

05:03.653 --> 05:05.020
He said, "As far
as you know."

05:05.021 --> 05:06.689
No, I didn't.
You said it.

05:06.690 --> 05:08.023
Don't worry about
who said it.

05:08.024 --> 05:09.158
Just watch the butt.

05:09.159 --> 05:11.686
Jimmy Jr.,
I just decided.

05:12.095 --> 05:13.762
I'm going to the dance with...

05:14.865 --> 05:16.432
...Josh.

05:17.601 --> 05:21.470
Well, would you at least
think about changing your mind?

05:21.471 --> 05:24.273
As a handsome dancer
once said, "Maybe."

05:24.274 --> 05:25.674
You're-you're the
handsome dancer.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.998
Jimmy Jr. had a chance to hitch
his trailer to the Tina truck,

05:32.164 --> 05:34.167
but now it's headed down
the highway to Joshville.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.335
Honk, honk.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.637
Two boys like Tina
at the same time?

05:37.638 --> 05:40.807
And one of them's not even
papier-matcher, like Roberto was.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.141
What happened
to Roberto?

05:42.142 --> 05:43.309
Did you try
to shower with him?

05:43.310 --> 05:44.310
Yeah.

05:44.311 --> 05:45.612
Maybe.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.046
Well, good
for you, Tina.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.082
When I see Jimmy Jr.
at the dance on Saturday,

05:49.083 --> 05:51.851
I'm gonna tell him, "Go do your 'you
had your chance dance,' buddy."

05:51.852 --> 05:53.152
Wait-wait a minute.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.555
Now we're chaperoning a dance
Tina's not even going to?

05:55.556 --> 05:56.823
We're not doing it
for her, Bobby.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.157
We're doing it for you.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.860
I really wish we weren't
doing it for me.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.162
Oh, wake up, we do
everything for you.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.064
Dad, if you believe
you're beautiful, you will be.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.532
I did.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.934
But maybe we can do something
about that hair.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.102
Did you wash it?

06:10.671 --> 06:12.105
Walk home
with us, Tina.

06:12.106 --> 06:13.706
There's just
something about your smell

06:13.707 --> 06:14.907
that keeps
the mean dogs away.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.242
Not today.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.377
Josh is coming
to pick me up.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.811
Tights.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.114
Tina, is he a superhero?

06:21.115 --> 06:22.382
Hey, Tina.
Hey, Josh.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.783
So, I'm here
to pick you up.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.176
- Whoa, careful!
- Whoa. Whoa.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.285
Whoa.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.187
Get it?
I literally picked you up.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.223
It was like being
on a romantic stool.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.392
Yeah, well, that
was just a stool sample.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.726
There's more
where that came from.

06:33.761 --> 06:34.961
Ten bucks says
you can't lift Gene.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.396
Toss me into a tree,
then tell everyone

06:36.397 --> 06:38.097
I climbed it myself
like a normal boy.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.365
Wait, wait, wait.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.534
Pick me up, pick me up.
Here we go.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.536
- Put me down! Put me down!
- Okay, now, now you're down!

06:43.537 --> 06:44.871
And now you're down.
That was cool.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.105
Lifting a girl.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.173
Big deal.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.675
I'm sorry.
You are?

06:48.709 --> 06:49.709
Better than you.

06:49.743 --> 06:53.379
And what? This is Jimmy Jr., the
other boy who asked me to a dance.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.748
This is Josh, the other
boy who asked me to a dance.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.816
I'm Zeke.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.418
I'm going stag.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.619
So you dance, huh?

06:59.620 --> 07:00.820
On those twigs?

07:00.821 --> 07:02.588
You just got J-Ju-ed.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.123
Whoa, guys, slow down.

07:04.124 --> 07:07.093
Is this really worth it?

07:07.127 --> 07:09.162
Come on, Tina.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.230
We've got reservations
at a frozen yogurt stand.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.833
Ha, can't afford
regular yogurt.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.402
I can't believe Tina
found another dancer.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.137
She's rubbing that
guy's feet in my face.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.772
Uh-oh.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.275
Somebody's as jealous as a
bald guy in a mop factory.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.010
I'm not jealous, Zeke.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.011
I just don't!

07:25.012 --> 07:26.112
Like!

07:26.113 --> 07:27.246
That guy!

07:27.247 --> 07:28.481
Hey, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.782
Calm down, now.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.617
You want her back,
we'll get her back.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.619
You think so, Zeke?
I don't know, but maybe.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.321
Well, you just said...
Oh, just trust me!

07:35.322 --> 07:36.689
Well, well...
Kind of.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.891
It's so hard
when two boys want you.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.627
You seem to be kind of enjoying
all this attention, Tina.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.296
Come on, Bob.
Tina had a long wait

07:43.297 --> 07:45.431
till she got to the buffet.
Let her pig out.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.033
I'm just saying, you
shouldn't string boys along.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.468
It's not right.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.369
You can't just tell a boy
on the steps

07:50.370 --> 07:52.105
of Buchanan Middle Schoo
30 years ago

07:52.106 --> 07:55.108
that you're not going to the dance
with him when you said you would.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.776
Whoa.
What happened, Bob?

07:56.777 --> 07:58.511
Yeah, Dad,
open that wound.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.646
- Let's poke around in there.
- All right, all right.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.515
<i>I was 13, and I just spent</i>

08:02.516 --> 08:03.850
<i>my allowance on a corsage.</i>

08:03.851 --> 08:05.585
<i>- Idiot.</i>
- Hey, Becky.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.286
I got you
this corsage.

08:07.287 --> 08:10.523
It goes really nice with your...
other corsage?

08:10.524 --> 08:11.657
Yeah, Curt gave it to me.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.825
Hey.
Oh, hey, Curt.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.160
'Sup?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.528
Sorry, I didn't know
how to tell you.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.662
I thought this
would be easiest.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.165
Yeah, yeah, this is, um...
this is really easy, Becky.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.166
Thanks.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.167
Oh, well.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.502
I'll see
you inside.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.003
Great belt.
Great neck.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.505
What'd you say?
Uh... nothing.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.906
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.307
Your fly's down.
No, it isn't.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.177
Oh, got me.
Yep.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.479
Is this stuff really
important to the story, Dad?

08:33.480 --> 08:34.679
Aw, Bobby.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.015
That settles it.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.650
We're gonna
make up for that awful,

08:37.650 --> 08:39.684
terrible night and all
your other missed dances, Bobby.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.554
That's not why
I told the story, Lin.

08:41.554 --> 08:45.591
This is gonna be the biggest,
glitziest, Bobby-est school dance ever.

08:45.592 --> 08:48.227
And if there's a chaperone
king, it's gonna be you.

08:48.262 --> 08:50.530
There's no such thing
as a chaperone king.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.365
Well, there wasn't a
raccoon king in our alley

08:52.366 --> 08:54.600
until I went out there
and picked my favorite one.

08:54.601 --> 08:57.036
His name's
Little King Trash Mouth.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.271
He's gay.
He's gay?

08:58.787 --> 08:59.872
Yeah.
Why?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.774
He's got a boyfriend.
They just got married.

09:01.775 --> 09:02.775
Hmm.
Wha...?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.212
All right, J-Ju,
get your net ready.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.481
We're about to hook us
a trout called Tina.

09:08.515 --> 09:09.515
Hey, Tina.

09:09.516 --> 09:10.550
Hi, Jimmy Jr.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.551
What's up, girl?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.020
I got you!
I got you!

09:14.021 --> 09:15.188
Come on!

09:15.189 --> 09:16.923
Uh-oh, J-Ju's
starting to rally.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.224
Oh, he beat me.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.325
Oh, look at this boy.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.562
Look at that r-raging testosterone
just throbbing out of him.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.564
Ah, yeah.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.566
How you like
my boy now, lady?

09:26.567 --> 09:27.700
Ah, I got mad.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.168
My main man's
a crazy man.

09:29.203 --> 09:30.870
I know what you're
doing, Jimmy Jr.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.072
You're trying to get me
to go to the dance with you.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.273
Well, try again.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.741
I mean it,
try again.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.118
Um... right now?

09:37.144 --> 09:38.411
No, later.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.846
Just do something
without Zeke.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.948
Well, if that didn't
work, nothing will.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.549
Sorry, J-Ju.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.318
- Now let's finish what we started!
- No, Zeke!

09:45.319 --> 09:47.220
Ow!
You little son of a bitch!

09:48.622 --> 09:51.724
Hey, guys has, um... Tina
been talking about me at all?

09:51.725 --> 09:53.059
Um, no.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.861
Tough break, Jr.
Tough break.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.471
Hey, will you guys help me
get her back?

09:56.496 --> 09:58.397
We'll help you,
for a price.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.832
Can you really
put a price on love?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.367
Yes, you can. It's $20.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.436
Okay, just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.604
Anything.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.872
Hey, but don't let Tina know.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.573
Jimmy Jr., please.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.408
We are professional
and discreet.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.310
We would never
tell her.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.479
Hey, Tina, Jimmy Jr. just
hired us to help win you back.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.714
He did?

10:14.748 --> 10:17.083
That is the sleaziest,
sneakiest,

10:17.084 --> 10:19.485
most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.520
Great. Can we quote you
on that for our Web site?

10:21.521 --> 10:23.347
And could you
make us a Web site?

10:24.039 --> 10:26.546
Operation Squash Josh
a go.

10:26.547 --> 10:28.125
Take your positions.

10:28.126 --> 10:29.552
Hi, Tina.

10:29.553 --> 10:30.978
Wow, a horse.

10:30.979 --> 10:32.479
That's me, Jimmy Jr.

10:33.717 --> 10:34.921
What are you doing in there?

10:34.922 --> 10:36.872
Say, "I love you more than hay!"

10:36.873 --> 10:39.008
Say, "I love you. Hey!"

10:39.042 --> 10:40.843
I love hay.

10:40.844 --> 10:42.725
Oh, that's nice.
'Cause you're a horse.

10:42.746 --> 10:44.513
Say, "Saddle up for love."

10:44.547 --> 10:46.081
Satellite above!

10:46.116 --> 10:48.517
Seattle has drugs.

10:48.518 --> 10:49.985
Oh, that's where
they have drugs.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.321
It's going great!
Hit her with the song.

10:52.355 --> 10:54.356
Cue the tune, lover boy.

10:54.391 --> 10:56.091
â™ª "T" is for the way

10:56.092 --> 10:58.494
â™ª You take my breath away

10:58.528 --> 11:00.162
â™ª "I" is for

11:00.196 --> 11:01.463
â™ª The way I like it

11:01.464 --> 11:03.932
â™ª When you take
my breath away â™ª

11:03.933 --> 11:08.270
â™ª "N" is for no one else
takes my breath away â™ª

11:08.271 --> 11:11.607
â™ª And "A" is for asthma

11:11.608 --> 11:13.208
â™ª That is a disease

11:13.209 --> 11:17.012
â™ª That takes people's
breath away. â™ª

11:17.047 --> 11:18.547
That was amazing.
Score.

11:18.581 --> 11:21.050
You did it.
Yeah. High-five all around.

11:21.084 --> 11:23.485
- This is going good.
- Hey, Tina.

11:23.486 --> 11:24.920
- What's with the horse?
- Jimmy Jr. dressed up

11:24.921 --> 11:25.921
like a horse to surprise me.

11:25.922 --> 11:27.156
Yeah, I know
what Tina wants.

11:27.157 --> 11:28.438
And, oh, by the way,

11:28.604 --> 11:30.356
- I kissed her.
- I kissed her, too.

11:30.522 --> 11:32.528
Well, I kissed her first.
And you kissed her worst.

11:32.562 --> 11:34.563
Guys, you both have kissed me.
It's true.

11:34.564 --> 11:36.298
And I appreciate
you dressing up

11:36.299 --> 11:39.001
as the most magical
non-magical animal there is.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.502
But I want to go
to Josh's dance.

11:40.503 --> 11:41.904
With Josh.
That's me.

11:41.938 --> 11:44.807
Ugh. When you tell me no,
it makes me want you more!

11:44.808 --> 11:45.808
Oh, no.
Aah!

11:45.809 --> 11:46.809
No.
Aah!

11:46.810 --> 11:48.310
No.
Aah!

11:48.311 --> 11:50.245
I thought you knew how
to seduce your sister.

11:50.246 --> 11:51.513
Wait, that's what
we're doing?

11:51.514 --> 11:52.781
Be patient.

11:52.782 --> 11:54.450
Come on, it
takes extra time

11:54.451 --> 11:56.752
to get through those
extra thick glasses.

11:56.753 --> 11:59.788
Plus she's a teenager
and they're so fickle.

11:59.789 --> 12:02.624
<i>Why do we have to get
a stupid babysitter?</i>

12:02.625 --> 12:04.259
What did I say about
using that word?

12:04.294 --> 12:06.061
- You're not stupid, Jen.
- I know.

12:06.096 --> 12:08.063
I brought this puzzle
for the kids to do.

12:08.098 --> 12:10.355
Oh, look, it's nails
all twisted up.

12:10.367 --> 12:13.802
I'm not saying it's unsolvable,
but it's probably unsolvable.

12:13.803 --> 12:15.537
It's like the Ruben's Cube
of nails.

12:15.538 --> 12:16.872
Yeah, that looks
great, Jen.

12:16.873 --> 12:18.140
Oh-ho-ho...

12:18.141 --> 12:19.375
Done!

12:19.376 --> 12:20.976
- Oh, my God.
- What else you got?

12:20.977 --> 12:22.878
Uh... we could look at my hand.
One of my fingers...

12:22.879 --> 12:24.213
I got it caught
in a leaf blower.

12:24.214 --> 12:25.247
And so the knuckle
didn't grow.

12:25.281 --> 12:26.548
Oh, look at
the hand.

12:26.549 --> 12:27.816
Wow.
That's great.

12:27.817 --> 12:29.051
Thank you.

12:33.189 --> 12:34.690
Ta-da.

12:34.691 --> 12:37.126
Oh, my God,
it's like a fairy tale!

12:37.127 --> 12:39.194
What a couple
of sexy beasts!

12:40.530 --> 12:41.997
Can we just go?
Hi, Jen.

12:41.998 --> 12:43.665
Not before I get a
picture, you can't.

12:43.666 --> 12:45.100
- Come on, you two, get together.
- Hmm.

12:45.135 --> 12:46.935
Say, "Romance."

12:46.970 --> 12:48.203
Romance.
Romance.

12:48.204 --> 12:50.105
Romance!

12:50.140 --> 12:51.473
Tina, your ride is here!

12:51.474 --> 12:54.524
And, uh...
oh, what's this, Bobby?

12:54.690 --> 12:56.512
Our ride is here, too!
Look!

12:56.513 --> 12:58.046
I told the guy
at the limo place

12:58.047 --> 13:00.115
your sad story,
and he gave us a discount.

13:00.150 --> 13:02.518
I'm staying home.
No, you're not.

13:02.519 --> 13:05.854
Come on, I want to stand up in
the sun roof and yell bwah!

13:05.855 --> 13:07.089
Right?
Yup.

13:08.691 --> 13:11.093
â™ª

13:12.729 --> 13:14.263
I'm a little
nervous.

13:14.264 --> 13:16.398
I know, there's a lot
of talent in this room.

13:16.399 --> 13:18.033
Hey, remember
to stretch, you two.

13:18.034 --> 13:20.383
Or else you might get hurt
doing this... Ha!

13:20.403 --> 13:22.304
Don't worry, Douglas.
I won't be doing that.

13:22.338 --> 13:24.679
No, I know you won't,
sweetheart.

13:24.845 --> 13:25.941
I like this song.

13:25.942 --> 13:27.409
So do I.

13:27.410 --> 13:29.511
Maybe we could like it
on the dance floor.

13:31.514 --> 13:33.382
Just think of me
as your Nutcracker.

13:33.383 --> 13:34.917
Sorry, that's the
only ballet I know.

13:34.918 --> 13:36.385
What about the
lipcracker...?

13:36.386 --> 13:39.555
Is that a real ballet, or
are you asking me to kiss?

13:39.556 --> 13:40.889
Both.

13:40.890 --> 13:43.292
JIMMY JR.
Put the lips down!

13:44.811 --> 13:45.819
Jimmy Jr.?

13:45.820 --> 13:48.263
I came to fight
for you, Tina.

13:48.264 --> 13:49.731
Like fight-fight?
No.

13:49.732 --> 13:51.967
I'm challenging you
to a dance-off!

13:51.968 --> 13:55.204
Oh, my God,
a real dance-off!

13:55.205 --> 13:56.939
My idea. And
you're welcome.

13:56.940 --> 13:58.507
A pants off?
For me?

13:58.508 --> 13:59.908
Uh, no, a
dance-off.

13:59.909 --> 14:01.495
Oh. That's almost
as good.

14:07.903 --> 14:09.437
Do Mom and Dad
know you're here?

14:09.438 --> 14:10.638
I didn't know
what to do with them.

14:10.639 --> 14:11.906
They solved the puzzle.

14:11.907 --> 14:13.141
I didn't bring
any backup puzzles.

14:13.142 --> 14:16.110
Yeah, we stared at a knuckle-less
finger for about 20 minutes.

14:16.145 --> 14:17.945
Uh, Tina,
eyes on me.

14:17.946 --> 14:19.781
- I'm winning you back.
- Right, sorry.

14:19.782 --> 14:21.616
<i>So You Think You Can Dance</i>
called.

14:21.617 --> 14:23.484
They said, "You can't."

14:23.485 --> 14:25.420
Oh!

14:25.454 --> 14:29.524
Did you, uh... learn that joke at
the School for Performing Farts?

14:31.593 --> 14:34.162
These are the best insults
about dancing I ever heard!

14:42.371 --> 14:44.205
I don't ever
want to leave this limo.

14:44.206 --> 14:45.840
Oh, come on,
you little wallflower.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.909
I'm gonna pick you.
Gonna pluck your little petals.

14:47.943 --> 14:50.311
- Da-da-da-du!
- All right, I'm coming.

14:52.147 --> 14:54.248
Mr. and Mrs. Belcher.

14:54.283 --> 14:56.451
You are our best-dressed
chaperones.

14:56.452 --> 14:58.686
Aw, thank you,
Miss Jacobson.

14:58.687 --> 15:00.188
It's my Bobby's
first dance.

15:00.189 --> 15:02.109
- Uh, first dance as a chaperone.
- Oh.

15:02.124 --> 15:03.291
I've been to
dances before.

15:03.325 --> 15:05.960
Of course. If you'll excuse me...
Hands where I can see 'em!

15:05.961 --> 15:08.029
Ooh, Miss Jacobson's
a looker, isn't she?

15:08.030 --> 15:09.263
You're telling me.

15:09.298 --> 15:10.698
Why is she a teacher?

15:10.699 --> 15:12.667
She should be, like,
playing a teacher on TV.

15:12.668 --> 15:14.435
All right.
That's enough.

15:14.470 --> 15:16.804
I'm just saying,
I just... Yeah. She's, um...

15:16.839 --> 15:19.043
- ridiculously attractive.
- Enough!

15:19.074 --> 15:22.777
Guys, Jimmy Jr. called the
dance-off, so he's gonna go first.

15:22.811 --> 15:25.980
No moves are forbidden,
except "The Forbidden Move"!

15:26.014 --> 15:27.849
Good luck to both of you.

15:27.850 --> 15:29.851
And don't be self-conscious
if you start sweating a lot,

15:29.852 --> 15:31.586
and your shirt sticks
to your chest and your abs.

15:31.587 --> 15:32.854
Thanks, Tina.
Thanks, Tina.

15:32.855 --> 15:35.056
DJ? Cue up
something that rocks!

15:35.057 --> 15:36.290
Yeah!

15:36.325 --> 15:38.726
â™ª

15:47.002 --> 15:49.003
Okay, there.
We danced, all right?

15:49.004 --> 15:51.506
I-I got the middle school
dance experience I never had.

15:51.507 --> 15:53.174
Thank you, Lin.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.610
One dance? Bobby, you didn't
even move your feet.

15:55.611 --> 15:57.536
You're still not getting
into the spirit.

15:57.537 --> 15:59.547
Look, we have a responsibility.
We're chaperones.

15:59.548 --> 16:01.949
I saw a kid lick
another kid's eyeball.

16:01.950 --> 16:04.685
Seems like something we should
get him in trouble for.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.622
Wait, wait, wait, wait, Bobby.
Uh, I'm sorry I blew my lid

16:07.623 --> 16:10.825
- about Miss Jacobson.
- Hey. Hi. Hi. Hi.

16:10.859 --> 16:11.927
It's fine.

16:11.928 --> 16:14.098
It's just, you know,
she-she really is a hottie.

16:14.129 --> 16:15.222
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:15.223 --> 16:17.465
I bet if she asked you to dance,
you'd take another spin.

16:17.466 --> 16:18.833
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you?

16:18.867 --> 16:21.035
No. No. I... No.
I would not be interested.

16:21.036 --> 16:22.170
Go on, say it.

16:22.204 --> 16:23.538
Say you'd rather dance with her!

16:23.572 --> 16:25.606
I-I... Wh... I...
Say it!

16:25.641 --> 16:28.376
- This is for you!
- There!

16:28.377 --> 16:30.878
Linda. What the hell?

16:38.120 --> 16:39.954
Cut the fog, man!
Cut the fog!

16:47.563 --> 16:48.563
Yeah!

16:48.564 --> 16:49.997
Douglas, what do you think?

16:49.998 --> 16:51.732
Take it slow or go rough?

16:51.733 --> 16:54.535
Josh, you be as nasty
as you need to be.

16:54.570 --> 16:56.037
Yes, nasty.

16:56.071 --> 16:58.072
DJ, my music.

17:09.184 --> 17:12.819
Wow, he looks like a
lion murdering a cloud.

17:12.820 --> 17:14.989
I know.
Isn't it beautiful?

17:15.022 --> 17:17.157
Linda? What's wrong with you?

17:17.159 --> 17:18.893
What are you doing in there?

17:18.926 --> 17:21.095
We just... I'm talking
to my girlfriends!

17:21.128 --> 17:22.630
Oh.
Go away, Bob!

17:22.631 --> 17:23.931
You want to dance
with Miss Jacobson!

17:23.932 --> 17:25.665
You think
she's prettier than me.

17:25.701 --> 17:28.569
Yes, she's hot, but it
doesn't matter. Who cares?

17:28.604 --> 17:30.204
Look, I-I'm going
to go back out to the dance

17:30.205 --> 17:31.973
and pretend none
of this is happening

17:31.974 --> 17:34.108
because you're acting
like a middle schooler, Linda,

17:34.109 --> 17:37.712
and I am, uh... Oh...
Gotcha!

17:37.713 --> 17:41.015
- So that was just so...
- So you could have a little drama.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.617
It's your middle
school dance.

17:42.651 --> 17:44.619
What, did you think
these things are fun? Come on.

17:44.653 --> 17:47.221
You are definitely nuts.

17:47.222 --> 17:49.290
But now you're more
in the spirit, right?

17:49.291 --> 17:51.158
You got some more dance
in your pants, don't you?

17:51.159 --> 17:53.194
- Ooh. Come on.
- I don't. No. That... I don't know.

17:53.195 --> 17:54.991
- Stop.
- Come on, this might help right here.

17:54.997 --> 17:57.965
- I brought some schnapps.
- Here? We'll get in trouble, Lin.

17:57.966 --> 17:59.800
That's right.

17:59.801 --> 18:02.136
That's bad.
That is really bad.

18:02.137 --> 18:04.805
Oh, my Go... oh, my God,
it just got good.

18:04.806 --> 18:06.173
Look.
You brought two?

18:06.174 --> 18:07.708
Double-fist it.
Double-fist it.

18:07.709 --> 18:09.610
I'm not mixing
peach and mint.

18:11.046 --> 18:14.482
Mmm.

18:14.516 --> 18:21.489
- And with great dignity, the swan...
- dies.

18:21.523 --> 18:24.759
Why did I not
bring any roses to toss?

18:24.760 --> 18:27.228
I should always carry roses!

18:27.229 --> 18:29.030
This isn't over!

18:29.064 --> 18:30.364
Lightning round!

18:30.365 --> 18:33.000
DJ, kick it!

18:49.685 --> 18:52.119
Here I am. No, I'm not.
Here I am. No, I'm not.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.220
Here I am. No, I'm not.

19:01.029 --> 19:03.831
Stop. Turn off the music.
Someone's gonna get hurt.

19:05.701 --> 19:06.934
I can't choose.

19:08.570 --> 19:10.608
Maybe I don't have to choose.

19:20.215 --> 19:22.616
We can make this work. We'll
come up with a make-out wheel.

19:22.617 --> 19:24.051
Kind of like a chore wheel.

19:24.086 --> 19:27.021
Uh, I don't want to do this.
Yeah, me, neither.

19:27.055 --> 19:30.024
Give it a chance. Let's put
the "try" in "triangle."

19:30.058 --> 19:32.793
Um, no, thanks.
Talk to you later, okay?

19:32.794 --> 19:35.229
Tonight was really fun.
Until all of this.

19:35.230 --> 19:36.530
This was a mess.

19:36.565 --> 19:40.101
Oh. Yeah, um, I kind of forgot
what I was even doing here.

19:40.102 --> 19:42.737
Well, we have a draw, but
we also have a loser.

19:42.738 --> 19:44.805
Which would, of course,
be you, Tina.

19:44.806 --> 19:46.607
If you ever go back
to being a one-boy girl,

19:46.608 --> 19:48.109
you know where
to find me. And, hey,

19:48.143 --> 19:50.231
Jimmy Jr., you got
some great moves.

19:50.245 --> 19:51.482
You thinking what I'm thinking?

19:51.513 --> 19:53.234
Let's do this.

19:55.851 --> 19:59.253
Oh, yeah, girl! We got
ourselves a dance on!

19:59.254 --> 20:02.289
- Too bad, T.
-  I got greedy and grabby.

20:02.290 --> 20:04.325
But I had two boys
fighting over me.

20:04.326 --> 20:06.360
I'm thankful for that.
Sorry you weren't able

20:06.361 --> 20:08.662
to make Jimmy Jr.
and Josh your sister-wives.

20:08.663 --> 20:10.097
Hey, maybe next dance.

20:10.098 --> 20:12.066
You flew too close
to the buns.

20:12.100 --> 20:15.503
Watch the hands.

20:15.504 --> 20:19.340
Um, Mr. and Mrs. Belcher?
Hi. I'm gonna have to ask you

20:19.341 --> 20:21.142
to tone it down
a little bit.

20:21.143 --> 20:23.978
Oh, you mean tone it down
like this? Whoop!

20:24.012 --> 20:26.180
- No. That is not what I mean.
- Hmm.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.149
This is completely
inappropriate behavior.

20:28.150 --> 20:30.688
Bobby's first dance!

20:30.719 --> 20:33.954
Oh, my God. Oh, Lin.
Oh, the schnapps.

20:33.955 --> 20:36.557
- Oh, Lin.
-  Oh, it tastes like peach.

20:36.558 --> 20:38.192
Oh, man.
That's all over me.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.161
Ah, I got to take
my shirt off. I'm gonna...

20:40.162 --> 20:42.963
- I'm gonna lose it, too!
- Can I get a little help over here?

20:42.964 --> 20:45.733
- I'm gonna lose it!
- All right, these two, out. Right here.

20:45.734 --> 20:48.135
Ooh, you're even prettier
when you're angry, little lady.

20:48.136 --> 20:49.556
I got it! I got it!

20:49.557 --> 20:51.138
You're not security.
You're friends with Tina.

20:51.139 --> 20:53.307
- Hey. Get your hands off me.
- What? Hey! These two.

20:53.308 --> 20:55.910
- Get 'em out.
- Get your hands off me, little guy.

21:01.650 --> 21:06.420
â™ª "T" is for the way
you take my breath away â™ª

21:08.056 --> 21:13.828
â™ª "I" is for the way I like it
when you take my breath away â™ª

21:13.829 --> 21:19.707
â™ª "N" is for no one else
takes my breath away â™ª

21:19.708 --> 21:23.702
â™ª And "A" is for asthma
that is a disease â™ª

21:23.703 --> 21:26.986
â™ª That takes people's breath
away! â™ª

21:26.987 --> 21:29.010
Oh, that's nice.
'Cause you're a horse.
