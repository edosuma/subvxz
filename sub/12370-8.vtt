YOU SHOULD SEE THE WAY
MY MOTHER

00:44.544 --> 00:47.338

BEEN A GOOD THING.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.464
- NO, NO, NO,
MY SOCIAL MEDIA CONSULTANT

01:29.547 --> 01:31.674
SAYS THAT MY TWEETS
ARE TOO SELF-INVOLVED.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.844

ALL THEIR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS

01:36.930 --> 01:38.181

AND HE RECORDED

09:31.404 --> 09:33.281
EVERY UNFLATTERING THING
I SAID.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.199
NOW MY VOICE

A MAN'S OPINION.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.891

YES, MA'AM.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.102

11:26.185 --> 11:27.436

11:27.520 --> 11:30.314
FOR FALLING
FOR THE MCRIB HYPE.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.066
- SO YOU SEDUCED HER

11:32.149 --> 11:33.609

- MELANIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

18:45.499 --> 18:46.542
- JOY, SHUT UP.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.001
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.
- I'M WHAT?

18:48.085 --> 18:49.837
- CAN'T YOU JUST GO
TO COMMERCIAL OR SOMETHING?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.880
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.715
- FINE.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.342
OKAY, MY TUMOR IS GONE,

18:55.425 --> 18:58.720
BUT I ONLY FOUND OUT
AFTER I SENT THE EMAIL.

18:58.804 --> 19:02.224
- YOUR EMAIL
SAID IT WAS INCURABLE.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.561
- MAYBE YOUR SONG CURED ME.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.437
- MELANIE, DARLING,
JUST GET OUT OF THERE.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.065
AND DON'T DO
THAT LITTLE WAVE THING.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.943
IT'S NOT AS CUTE
AS YOU THINK IT IS.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.743
- HELLO, ELKA.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.704
- YOU'RE STILL MAD?

19:23.787 --> 19:25.414
- WELL, NATURALLY,
I WAS UPSET,

19:25.497 --> 19:27.583
SO I DROVE AROUND
TO GET OVER IT,

19:27.666 --> 19:31.169
AND THEN I SAW A SIGN
ADVERTISING THE MCRIB.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.923
WELL, I TOOK THE SIGN
FOR A SIGN,

19:35.007 --> 19:38.260
AND I DID SOMETHING
THAT I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE:

19:38.343 --> 19:41.763
PLACED AN ORDER FOR FOOD
BY YELLING INTO A BOX.

19:44.182 --> 19:47.895
- WELL, THANK YOU,
VICTORIA.

19:47.978 --> 19:48.729
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING GOOD

19:48.812 --> 19:51.106
DID COME OUT OF THIS.

19:51.189 --> 19:52.941
NOW I KNOW
THAT I AM TRULY READY

19:53.025 --> 19:54.776
TO MOVE ON FROM EMMET.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.905
ALTHOUGH IT'S GONNA
BE HARD TO FIND

19:57.988 --> 19:59.364
SOMEONE AS PERFECT
AS NICK.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.116
- AH.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.951
- I'M REALLY
GONNA MISS HIM.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.496
- I'M REALLY
GONNA MISS HIM TOO.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.624
- I THINK I LIKED
OUR EMAILS BEST

20:08.707 --> 20:10.292
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.753
- YOU, ALL WARM AND SLEEPY.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.630
- YOU, A LITTLE BOOZY.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.257
[both chuckle]

20:19.009 --> 20:20.594
- NOW IT'S GETTING WEIRD.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.679
- MM.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.017
- HERE'S TO NICK LOGAN.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.854
- A MAN SO PERFECT, ONLY A WOMAN
COULD'VE INVENTED HIM.
