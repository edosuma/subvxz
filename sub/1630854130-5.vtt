Turn around!
And get on your knees!

12:54.251 --> 12:56.601
Where is she?
- Who?

12:56.645 --> 12:58.386
- Keep your hands up!

12:58.429 --> 13:00.040
- I don't know
what you're talking about, OK?

13:00.083 --> 13:01.084
- Put your hands
behind your head.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.999
You guys,
I got one in custody.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.045
Keep clearing the house.
The girl might still be here.

13:05.088 --> 13:07.090
Is she still here?

13:07.134 --> 13:08.918
- I am looking
for somebody too, OK?

13:08.962 --> 13:11.355
I'm looking for a kid of mine.
Her name's Abby.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.922
- Who's Abby?
Is she your daughter?

13:12.966 --> 13:14.445
- I run a safe place program.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.796
She's a kid
that comes to my center, OK?

13:16.839 --> 13:18.058
- Sit down.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.933
- I am who I say I am.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.592
And I take it
my dad's your boss.

13:38.426 --> 13:38.600
.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.863
- So this is Abby?
Abby Jacobs?

13:40.907 --> 13:42.212
- That's Abby.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.561
- Who is she to you?

13:43.605 --> 13:46.173
- I told you, she's a kid
that comes to my center.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.391
She has meals with us
most days.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.653
She does NA with us.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.525
- How long
has she been missing?

13:50.568 --> 13:54.007
- Well, we don't house kids,
but she hasn't come by

13:54.050 --> 13:56.748
in, like, 48 hours,
and that's not really like her.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.489
- Does she have a cell phone?

13:58.533 --> 14:00.100
- No, no,
she doesn't have a cell phone.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.144
She doesn't have
a bank account.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.319
She's a street kid.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.538
- What about a boyfriend
or a pimp?

14:03.581 --> 14:05.018
- Excuse me?
- I'm asking

14:05.061 --> 14:06.410
if you know of anyone
that would want to abduct her,

14:06.454 --> 14:08.717
abuse her.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.588
- Why?
Is that happening to her?

14:10.632 --> 14:13.069
- Answer the question.

14:13.113 --> 14:16.072
- No, she doesn't have
a boyfriend that I know of.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.900
And she doesn't have a pimp.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.771
She's a good kid.

14:19.815 --> 14:22.339
She's a little bit headstrong,
but so am I. So are you.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.733
- Then why'd you go looking
for her at that trap house?

14:26.256 --> 14:28.606
- [sighs]

14:28.650 --> 14:31.653
'Cause I was worried
she might have relapsed.

14:31.696 --> 14:34.917
I went everywhere I can think
of you can get high for cheap.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.224
- You go looking for every kid
that comes through your doors?

14:37.267 --> 14:39.922
- If I think they're
gonna OD at 16, I do, yeah.

[door opens]

14:40.967 --> 14:42.707

14:42.751 --> 14:44.927
- Dad, I'm good.
I'm sober, all right?

14:44.971 --> 14:46.668
One of my kids is missing.
I'm trying to help find her.

14:46.711 --> 14:49.453
- Then what the hell
is he doing in here?

14:49.497 --> 14:51.107
- I was just asking him
some questions.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.153
- You...

14:53.196 --> 14:54.284
Come on.
Let's go.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.982
It's OK.
- All right.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.296
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.819
- So Sean checks out.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.647
He runs a center
called Safe Place Oasis.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.954
- For teens?
- 13 to 21-year-olds.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.217
Open door policy.
Any kid can show up.

15:14.261 --> 15:15.218
No questions asked.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.959
They provide meals, therapy,

15:17.003 --> 15:18.656
AA, NA meetings--

15:18.700 --> 15:20.702
basically anything
a struggling youth could need.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.313
- Call and let me know that
you're gonna pick up my son

15:23.357 --> 15:25.141
and bring him in?

15:25.185 --> 15:26.403
Is that right?

15:26.447 --> 15:28.101
Is that hard?
- Blood's a match.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.233
Blood at the trap house matches
the blood at the factory.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.801
DNA is a hit
on Abby's juvie samples.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.977
She was there.
- OK, so what do you think?

15:35.021 --> 15:37.501
You think he probably abducted
her from the trap house?

15:37.545 --> 15:40.026
- I mean,
there was broken glass, blood.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.375
It's possible.

15:41.418 --> 15:43.159
Somebody got her up there,
got her high,

15:43.203 --> 15:45.466
attacked her, and then
took her to the factory.

15:45.509 --> 15:46.989
- Are you thinking
stranger abduction?

15:47.033 --> 15:49.078
- Not necessarily.
It could be somebody she knows,

15:49.122 --> 15:50.123
somebody who lured her there.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.863
- Hmm.

15:51.907 --> 15:54.779
I mean, we know
Abby didn't know her father.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.086
Her mother passed away.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.392
There's no other family.

15:58.435 --> 16:01.308
She was handed off to DCFS
when she was six,

16:01.351 --> 16:02.483
habitually a runaway.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.224
She started running away
when she was ten.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.878
Multiple priors for possession,
a few juvie stints.

16:06.922 --> 16:09.011
She's been AWOL
for the past two years.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.013
- That's a long time
to survive on the streets.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.623
- Exactly.
That means that she has

16:12.667 --> 16:15.496
no registered phone number,
no social media,

16:15.539 --> 16:17.193
no LKAs,
and no known associates.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.716
She's--
[distant shouting]

16:18.760 --> 16:21.110
She's gonna be hard
to track her down.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.938
- Out of thin air.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.896
- Girl's a ghost.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.595
- I know her partner--
her husband--is gone.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.249
And I know why.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.991
I know full well she's
pulling any OT she can get.

16:32.034 --> 16:35.081
I know what that means, so
if she's mentally exhausted...

16:35.124 --> 16:36.778
- Hailey.

16:36.821 --> 16:37.953
I get it.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.128
Not now.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.129
- You want to talk about that?

16:40.173 --> 16:41.783
I'm happy to talk about that.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.048
- We need more on Abby.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.746
We can't build a timeline
or find a person of interest

16:48.790 --> 16:51.097
unless we have more
on our victim.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.894
- Look, I want to help
any way I can.

17:05.937 --> 17:08.244
I have more on Abby than you're
gonna get in her DCFS file.

17:08.288 --> 17:09.898
Just let me help.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.778
- All right, go with him.
Get everything you can get.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.269
- Are all the kids here
addicts?

17:33.313 --> 17:35.750
- Not all, no. Some.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.056
Get a lot of unhoused kids,

17:37.099 --> 17:39.232
kids who get kicked out
of their houses,

17:39.275 --> 17:41.973
a lot of kids who just fall
through the big, big cracks

17:42.017 --> 17:44.585
at DCFS and CPD.

17:46.761 --> 17:50.069
And of course, Abby.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.289
- What camp does she fall into?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.726
- Well, not just one,

17:55.770 --> 17:58.077
but she's an addict.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.730
She's been using
and living on the streets

17:59.774 --> 18:04.257
for a couple of years, but she
just got sober with our help.

18:06.650 --> 18:09.218
- Do you have anything
more recent?

18:09.262 --> 18:10.524
Who are her friends?

18:10.567 --> 18:12.047
Who does she date?
Where does she sleep?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.962
Would she have gone willingly
to that trap house?

18:14.005 --> 18:15.311
- That's a lot of questions.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.008
- Yeah.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.533
- You ever heard
of the pink cloud?

18:19.576 --> 18:22.144
- No.
- It's a term in sobriety.

18:22.188 --> 18:25.365
There's this feeling you get
right after you get sober,

18:25.408 --> 18:26.757
once you detox--

18:26.801 --> 18:29.978
this feeling that maybe
everything's gonna be OK.

18:30.021 --> 18:32.850
You can handle it, right?
You're invincible.

18:32.894 --> 18:35.157
But it's just a cloud.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.159
It's just a trick.

18:37.203 --> 18:40.945
It doesn't last long.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.209
The pain always finds you.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.561
- That's how Abby was feeling?

18:47.604 --> 18:50.041
- I bet.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.305
Yeah,
I bet she was feeling good.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.350
I bet she was feeling capable,

18:54.394 --> 18:59.486
but she wasn't ready to deal
with the pain underneath that.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.836
The only way out of that
is through.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.058
What?

19:07.102 --> 19:09.322
- You're talking
a lot of clichés.

19:10.714 --> 19:14.065
- It's 'cause
they're usually true.

19:14.109 --> 19:17.112
- So Abby was pulling back?
- Yeah.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.679
Yeah, and she stopped
showing up to her meeting.

19:18.722 --> 19:19.897
She stopped checking in
with her friends

19:19.941 --> 19:21.551
like she usually does.

19:21.595 --> 19:24.163
- Her friends?

19:24.206 --> 19:25.251
Are they here?

19:29.255 --> 19:31.257
- I don't like
bringing cops here.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.910
It's supposed to be
a safe place for them.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.434
- I'm just gonna ask
a couple of questions.

19:34.477 --> 19:37.611
- It tells us to accept
what we cannot change

19:37.654 --> 19:39.090
and to change what we can.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.310
But what--
- Sorry to interrupt.

19:41.354 --> 19:42.529
This is Hailey Upton.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.357
She's with
the Chicago Police Department.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.488
- Hi, Hailey.
- Hi.

19:45.532 --> 19:46.837
- Nobody's in any trouble.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.752
She just wants to ask you
a couple of questions.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.580
- About Abby Jacobs.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.103
Some of you might have noticed

19:52.147 --> 19:55.237
that Abby hasn't been
around here in a little while.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.848
She's actually
been reported missing.

19:57.892 --> 20:00.024
- Who reported her missing?

20:00.068 --> 20:02.113
- I did.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.941
We suspect that Abby
is with someone right now

20:03.985 --> 20:05.856
who means her harm.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.424
Has anybody heard
Abby mention somebody

20:08.468 --> 20:10.818
that she's afraid of, somebody
who might want to hurt her?

20:10.861 --> 20:13.037
- Like who?

20:13.081 --> 20:17.390
- Like a boyfriend,
an old foster parent, a friend.

20:19.130 --> 20:22.264
Somebody older, 30s, white.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.352
- Always the white dudes.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.441
[laughter]

20:25.485 --> 20:27.530
- Whoever has Abby right now,

20:27.574 --> 20:30.272
he's hurting her badly.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.143
I saw her.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.015
He beat her.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.973
And if we don't find her soon,
he might kill her.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.062
- We don't need
to tell them that.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.460
- Yeah, you're right.
My bad.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.853
I got to take this.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.899
- Sorry, guys.

20:55.428 --> 20:58.648
- Abs, what's going on?
I'm freaking, OK?

20:58.692 --> 21:00.084
You said everything was OK,

21:00.128 --> 21:02.130
but there's some police bitch
here at Safe Place,

21:02.173 --> 21:03.740
and she--

21:03.784 --> 21:05.264
- Give me the phone.

21:08.049 --> 21:10.181
- No, no, no, no, no.
Come here.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.531
- Hey, he's a kid!
Get your hands off him!

21:11.574 --> 21:12.923
Hey, come on. He's a kid.
- Sit down. Sit down.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.708
- You don't have--
- Hey, back the hell up!

21:14.751 --> 21:16.013
Unless you want to be arrested

21:16.057 --> 21:18.320
for assaulting
a police officer.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.756
I don't care
who your father is.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.411
There's a girl missing,
so back up.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.197
Get up.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.418
Let's go.

21:45.565 --> 21:45.782
.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.131
- You all right?
- Yeah.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.350
[tires screeching]

21:49.482 --> 21:50.570
Can you get him?
He's in the back.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.920
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, you can't tail me.

21:52.963 --> 21:54.661
And you can't be on the
premises without permission.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.184
- I know the guy at the gate.
- Of course you do.

21:56.227 --> 21:57.272
- Blake, you good?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.404
- Mr. O,
what am I supposed to do?

21:58.447 --> 22:00.188
What do I say?
- You don't say anything.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.843
You don't say anything until
you see me or a lawyer, OK?

22:02.886 --> 22:03.887
I'm gonna be right up.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.411
- I thought
you were gonna help.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.238
- This is me helping
the kids in my care.

22:07.282 --> 22:08.631
- This is not helping.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.546
- I know this system.
My dad runs this system.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.069
And I've seen it myself
more than once.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.420
You're not gonna apprehend
and question a kid of mine

22:14.463 --> 22:16.422
without a lawyer
and a child advocate present.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.902
- Of course
I'm not gonna do that.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.687
