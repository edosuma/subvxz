<i>Though Republic victories
outnumber their losses,</i>

00:21.165 --> 00:22.855
<i>the Jedi have been unable to stop</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:25.191
<i>Separatist advances
in the Outer Rim.</i>

00:25.715 --> 00:27.780
<i>The ever-elusive General Grievous</i>

00:27.905 --> 00:30.355
<i>stays one step ahead
of his opponents.</i>

00:30.515 --> 00:32.865
<i>With thousands of droid armies
at his command,</i>

00:33.225 --> 00:35.534
<i>the Jedi can never predict
where Grievous</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:38.412
<i>will strike next until now.</i>

00:38.755 --> 00:40.748
Stand by.
Grievous is boarding.

00:52.865 --> 00:55.262
- Status report.
- <i>There's too many of them.</i>

00:55.430 --> 00:58.599
Get yourselves to the escape pods.
I will deal with Grievous here.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.476
<i>But, sir, they're commando droids.</i>

01:00.644 --> 01:03.094
That does not matter, Captain.
Now go.

01:26.395 --> 01:27.895
Jedi.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.230
Grievous.

02:05.835 --> 02:08.335
Eeth Koth, isn't it?

02:08.753 --> 02:11.354
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.030
Your reputation precedes you,
General.

02:18.155 --> 02:21.015
Reputation of a coward...
and a murderer.

02:21.525 --> 02:22.685
Murederer?

02:23.255 --> 02:25.620
Is it murder to rip the galaxy

02:25.745 --> 02:28.495
of you Jedi filth?

03:14.935 --> 03:16.495
<i>Greetings, Jedi,</i>

03:16.755 --> 03:20.600
<i>it would seem, once again,
one of your order has lost his way</i>

03:20.725 --> 03:22.034
<i>and even better,</i>

03:22.245 --> 03:24.954
<i>a leading member
of your Jedi Council.</i>

03:26.695 --> 03:28.385
<i>Listen to me, Jedi,</i>

03:28.595 --> 03:31.020
<i>I do not care about your politics.</i>

03:31.145 --> 03:33.977
<i>I do not care about your Republic.</i>

03:34.285 --> 03:37.485
<i>I only live to see you die.</i>

03:42.685 --> 03:46.165
<i>But death will not come so easily
for Master Koth.</i>

03:46.465 --> 03:48.720
<i>I will make him suffer endlessly</i>

03:48.845 --> 03:52.335
<i>because I know
that is more painful for you all.</i>

03:56.805 --> 03:58.455
He's a monster.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.422
Away with the younglings.
Much there is to discuss.

04:05.665 --> 04:08.915
It's time somebody
finally put an end to that monster.

04:09.345 --> 04:11.145
On that, agreed we are.

04:11.625 --> 04:12.793
How to find him,

04:12.961 --> 04:14.511
the question remains.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.706
After engaging Grievous,
we lost contact with Master Koth.

04:20.165 --> 04:21.343
He could be anywhere.

04:22.115 --> 04:25.050
<i>Commander Wolffe has found a message
in the holo transmission.</i>

04:25.175 --> 04:26.390
<i>Play back the message.</i>

04:31.471 --> 04:32.271
Look.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.589
Hand signals.

04:34.335 --> 04:36.895
I admit my skills are rusty, but...

04:39.195 --> 04:40.970
Saleucami system,

04:41.095 --> 04:43.995
sector J-19.

04:45.195 --> 04:47.070
Zero-eight,

04:47.405 --> 04:49.155
zero-five,

04:49.375 --> 04:50.475
two-nine.

04:50.775 --> 04:51.775
Saleucami?

04:51.995 --> 04:55.628
But intelligence reported
Grievous has no ships near that sector.

04:57.025 --> 04:58.675
But so often inaccurate

04:58.895 --> 05:00.395
our intelligence is.

05:00.801 --> 05:01.851
I shall go.

05:02.165 --> 05:03.165
So will I.

05:03.575 --> 05:04.575
And I.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.531
Are you ready?

05:26.755 --> 05:28.011
Ready and waiting.

05:28.136 --> 05:29.790
<i>I shall engage the Separatist fleet</i>

05:29.915 --> 05:32.289
<i>and send you the coordinates
of Grievous' command ship.</i>

05:32.414 --> 05:34.514
Just make sure you get it right.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.126
<i>I always do.</i>

05:36.294 --> 05:39.129
How do you plan on getting Grievous
aboard your ship?

05:39.297 --> 05:42.300
<i>Not to worry.
The good General and I have a history.</i>

05:42.425 --> 05:45.260
<i>I'm sure he'll want
to even the score face-to-face.</i>

05:45.428 --> 05:48.790
Meanwhile, we'll jump in undetected
and board the command ship.

05:48.915 --> 05:52.328
If Master Koth is still alive,
you will find him.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.710
<i>Hopefully,
by the end of this mission,</i>

05:54.835 --> 05:56.510
<i>we will have saved Master Koth</i>

05:56.635 --> 05:59.066
<i>and captured General Grievous.</i>

06:14.125 --> 06:17.925
Sir, we have entered
the Saleucami system.

06:20.865 --> 06:23.115
Begin preparations for our landing.

06:24.195 --> 06:25.345
Yes, my lord.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.306
There are several ships
coming out of hyperspace.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.574
Are they Republic or Separatist?

06:36.605 --> 06:37.605
Republic.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.230
Three cruiser-class,
four escort-class.

06:41.730 --> 06:42.730
You see?

06:42.855 --> 06:45.955
Your compassionate friends
have come to rescue you,

06:46.595 --> 06:48.824
just as I knew they would.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.429
One of the Republic ships
is hailing us, my lord.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.897
Put him through.

07:15.255 --> 07:18.395
<i>General,
I knew one day I'd catch up to you.</i>

07:18.563 --> 07:20.983
Kenobi!
What a surprise.

07:21.265 --> 07:24.860
I assume you are here
to bring me to justice.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.480
<i>You know me too well.</i>

07:26.605 --> 07:28.095
Indeed, I do.

07:28.395 --> 07:30.199
Prepare to fire all cannons.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.517
And be alert.

07:31.642 --> 07:33.100
Where there is Kenobi,

07:33.225 --> 07:36.265
you will always find Skywalker
not far behind.

07:37.185 --> 07:41.185
The enemy ships are faster
and more maneuverable.

07:41.405 --> 07:43.445
I suggest caution.

07:43.671 --> 07:44.671
Draw them in.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.800
I want to board that vessel.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.255
I shall kill Kenobi face-to-face.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.033
We certainly have his attention.

07:57.505 --> 07:58.610
Admiral Yularen,

07:58.735 --> 08:01.855
keep Grievous' fleet occupied
so Anakin's arrival is undetected.

08:03.817 --> 08:04.950
Yes, General.

08:05.075 --> 08:06.276
Commence attack.

08:06.575 --> 08:08.225
All ships fire at will.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.658
Yes, sir. We're moving in.

08:21.042 --> 08:24.020
Commander Cody, do you have the exact
coordinates of the command ship yet?

08:24.145 --> 08:25.879
We're patching them through now,
sir.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.600
We are receiving the coordinates
from General Kenobi.

08:30.725 --> 08:34.174
How close are you going to jump in
next to Grievous' ship?

08:34.875 --> 08:36.140
Pretty close.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.390
Buckle up, boys.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.726
Define "pretty close."

08:39.894 --> 08:41.687
Close enough to get the job done.

08:49.613 --> 08:53.617
Get me a tractor beam lock on Kenobi's
ship and prepare a boarding party.

08:58.545 --> 09:01.248
Tractor beam has us, sir.
Shall we fire on the source?

09:01.645 --> 09:02.645
No, Cody.

09:03.001 --> 09:06.170
Let them think they have us.
We need a diversion for Anakin.

09:09.085 --> 09:10.549
Coming out of hyperspace.

09:10.885 --> 09:11.885
Hang on.

09:26.695 --> 09:28.145
Primary power down.

09:36.905 --> 09:39.105
So, was that close enough for you?

09:39.371 --> 09:41.997
Any closer,
and we'd be flying down hallways.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.457
Next time.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.320
Coast is clear, Rex.
Copy that, sir.

09:59.335 --> 10:03.160
Stay here and guard the entrance.
This may be our only way out.

10:03.285 --> 10:05.812
Skywalker, Master Koth is located
on the bridge.

10:06.305 --> 10:07.305
This way.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.510
Remember,

10:18.635 --> 10:22.639
we need to keep Grievous on this ship
until General Skywalker is clear.

10:54.735 --> 10:55.735
Kenobi.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.155
How we doing?

10:57.375 --> 10:58.525
We are close.

11:15.415 --> 11:16.645
So, Kenobi,

11:16.968 --> 11:18.844
is everything going as planned?

11:19.012 --> 11:21.912
That depends on your point of view,
General.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.649
You wouldn't come here without a plan,
and you wouldn't come alone.

11:33.590 --> 11:34.590
Tell me,

11:34.715 --> 11:37.738
do you think Skywalker
has rescued Master Koth yet?

11:49.495 --> 11:50.595
Surprise.

11:51.455 --> 11:52.711
Not exactly.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.265
At least,
they're not destroyer droids.

12:05.745 --> 12:08.130
The General's description
of your tactics

12:08.255 --> 12:11.055
have been 100% accurate today.

12:11.475 --> 12:13.035
Very impressive,

12:13.335 --> 12:14.983
even by my standards.

12:29.060 --> 12:32.084
Your plans have come
to ruination, Jedi.

12:32.605 --> 12:34.750
I hear a lot of talking, General,

12:34.875 --> 12:38.256
but in the final accounting,
what does all the talk get you?

12:38.435 --> 12:40.050
A futile quest for power,

12:40.175 --> 12:41.800
a mutilated body,

12:41.925 --> 12:44.735
and your place
as Dooku's errand boy.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.595
I'm no errand boy.

12:46.785 --> 12:49.875
I am not in this war
for Dooku's politics.

12:50.234 --> 12:53.090
I am the leader
of the most powerful droid army

12:53.215 --> 12:54.965
the galaxy has ever seen.

12:58.985 --> 13:01.815
An army with no loyalty, no spirit,

13:02.015 --> 13:03.505
just programming.

13:03.765 --> 13:07.369
Why do you need to show all your power?
What have you to gain?

13:07.785 --> 13:08.835
The future,

13:09.325 --> 13:11.935
a future where there are no Jedi.

13:22.125 --> 13:25.225
The story of Obi-Wan Kenobi
ends here.

13:39.955 --> 13:43.015
One more step,
and your friend will die.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.944
Your friends shall die, Kenobi,

14:23.205 --> 14:24.946
and you shall soon follow.

14:31.315 --> 14:33.045
Got to get it...

14:36.675 --> 14:37.725
Behind you.

15:00.785 --> 15:02.535
I see you got my message.

15:03.105 --> 15:04.236
Where's Grievous?

15:04.591 --> 15:06.720
If everything's gone
according to plan,

15:06.845 --> 15:08.448
he's on board Obi-Wan's ship.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.908
He's been captured?

15:10.076 --> 15:11.520
If we can cut off his escape,

15:11.645 --> 15:13.119
there's a good chance of that.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.575
Surrender, General.

15:30.055 --> 15:30.846
Never!

15:38.825 --> 15:40.814
I hope you've rescued Master Koth,

15:40.982 --> 15:43.275
<i>because Grievous
is headed back to his ship.</i>

15:43.485 --> 15:44.585
You both go.

15:44.905 --> 15:46.270
I'll make it back.

15:46.395 --> 15:47.487
I'll be fine.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.710
I'll have to disagree with you
on that one.

15:49.835 --> 15:51.940
Master Gallia, you go ahead.

15:52.065 --> 15:53.702
I'll get Eeth back to the shuttle.

15:54.175 --> 15:55.975
May the Force by with you.

15:59.755 --> 16:03.755
Get back to the bridge. We need
to detach before Grievous jumps ship.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.206
<i>Cody, come in.</i>

16:06.725 --> 16:09.425
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Grievous is heading your way.</i>

16:16.075 --> 16:17.960
Open fire on the Republic ship.

16:18.085 --> 16:19.635
Target their engines.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.105
But, sir,
the ships are still attached.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.360
It doesn't matter.

16:23.485 --> 16:26.435
Prepare all troops
for our landing on Saleucami.

16:43.497 --> 16:44.755
The circuits are fried.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.631
We have no controls.
I can't even get the engines online.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.919
We've lost our stabilizers.

17:21.044 --> 17:22.374
I can't hold her steady.

17:50.249 --> 17:52.623
Until we meet again, Kenobi.

18:34.256 --> 18:36.358
Hurry.
We can still catch him.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.283
Obi-Wan, Anakin's leaving.

18:38.532 --> 18:40.035
We'll be trapped on the ship.

18:43.172 --> 18:44.472
Anakin, come in.

18:47.733 --> 18:51.168
<i>We're in a bit of a spot,
and we need a way off of Grievous' ship.</i>

18:51.293 --> 18:53.187
There's a large hangar
near your position.

18:53.312 --> 18:55.467
Make your way there,
and I'll pick you up.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.112
<i>All droids to the landing craft.</i>

19:17.183 --> 19:19.933
Get to your stations.
We're going to detach.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.034
Prepare to launch.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.555
The reactor's been breached.
I can't lock it down!

19:58.865 --> 19:59.781
Here we go.

20:18.734 --> 20:20.784
Anakin, get me Admiral Yularen.

20:23.044 --> 20:25.045
Several craft
detached from Grievous' ship

20:25.170 --> 20:27.142
and attempted to land on Saleucami.

20:27.376 --> 20:30.314
Then we'll have to land and follow them.
Prepare the tanks.

20:30.439 --> 20:31.211
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

20:31.412 --> 20:33.297
There must be several landing sites.

20:33.422 --> 20:35.567
It may be hard
to locate the good General.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.338
You'll have
to command the space battle

20:37.463 --> 20:39.443
while Rex, Cody, and I
head to the surface.

20:39.568 --> 20:41.406
You sure you can handle this
on your own?

20:41.575 --> 20:43.125
I think I can manage.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.700
I'll get Master Koth
to a medical frigate.

21:09.115 --> 21:11.477
You all took a great risk
rescuing me.

21:11.734 --> 21:13.634
You're welcome, Master Koth.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.735
Since you divided your forces,

21:15.860 --> 21:17.710
Grievous is still at large.

21:18.383 --> 21:19.964
I would have gladly given my life

21:20.089 --> 21:22.697
if it meant
bringing that monster to justice!

21:23.814 --> 21:26.242
At least we all live
to fight another day.

21:37.444 --> 21:38.463
<i>Fugitive!</i>

21:38.631 --> 21:41.043
<i>Though the Republic
has won many decisive battles</i>

21:41.168 --> 21:43.682
<i>against the Separatist army
in the Outer Rim,</i>

21:43.807 --> 21:47.407
<i>the Jedi have failed to capture
the elusive General Grievous.</i>

21:47.807 --> 21:50.892
<i>After specifically targeting members
of the Jedi Council,</i>

21:51.060 --> 21:52.294
<i>a trap was set,</i>

21:52.419 --> 21:54.819
<i>but following
a fierce confrontation,</i>

21:55.147 --> 21:58.191
<i>the droid General managed to escape
to the surface of the planet Saleucami.</i>

21:59.735 --> 22:01.185
<i>Now the chase is on</i>

22:01.487 --> 22:04.447
<i>as General Kenobi leads
a squadron of clone troopers</i>

22:04.615 --> 22:07.065
<i>and closes in on his target.</i>

22:12.343 --> 22:14.825
We must find a way off this planet

22:14.950 --> 22:16.977
before they find us.

22:19.295 --> 22:20.681
We need to hurry

22:20.965 --> 22:22.615
and find an escape pod.

22:26.938 --> 22:30.098
Instead of scattering our troops
looking for all the escape pods,

22:30.358 --> 22:33.184
we shall head towards the wreckage
of the landing transport first.

22:37.671 --> 22:39.479
Contact the fleet.

22:40.437 --> 22:42.525
Our transmitter is destroyed.

22:43.422 --> 22:46.387
There is only one escape pod
that survived.

22:47.109 --> 22:49.709
We must get there
as quickly as possible.

22:49.893 --> 22:52.593
Let's hope the transmitter
is still intact.

22:53.297 --> 22:55.772
Now, find me some transportation.

23:14.089 --> 23:15.935
Sir,
the cruiser's returned to orbit.

23:16.449 --> 23:17.657
Any sign of Grievous?

23:17.867 --> 23:20.267
I believe
we've found Grievous' ship.

23:21.394 --> 23:22.988
Power low.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.361
Shutting down.

23:26.486 --> 23:27.739
I can't go on.

23:29.117 --> 23:31.117
Sir, we need to get
our power recharged.

23:31.441 --> 23:32.691
Not this again!

23:33.297 --> 23:36.511
How could your power cells
be so depleted?

23:37.042 --> 23:40.382
You would not let us ride
on one of those creatures with you, sir.

23:40.507 --> 23:42.628
If you would allow us
to close down for a few...

23:44.913 --> 23:46.299
Any more complaints?

23:47.635 --> 23:49.135
I don't think so.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.903
That's what I thought.

23:51.932 --> 23:53.829
Now let's find that pod.

23:55.611 --> 23:56.517
Yikes.

24:02.427 --> 24:04.308
Normalizing intakes are still warm.

24:04.679 --> 24:06.789
This couldn't have happened
too long ago.

24:06.914 --> 24:09.655
The crew compartment's
almost entirely destroyed.

24:09.931 --> 24:13.201
We'll split into teams.
Rex, take Jesse, Hardcase, and Kix

24:13.369 --> 24:15.203
- and search those wetlands.
- Yes, sir.

24:15.328 --> 24:18.003
Cody, you, Crys,
and I will pick it up from here.

24:18.128 --> 24:18.936
And Rex,

24:19.392 --> 24:21.177
if you get a visual on Grievous,

24:21.302 --> 24:23.252
contact us before you engage.

24:28.342 --> 24:31.066
- Rex is a smart man.
- Indeed.

24:31.299 --> 24:32.845
Always thinking on his feet.

24:37.985 --> 24:40.394
These droids are too gone
to give us any good intel.

24:44.735 --> 24:45.785
Here's one!

24:48.911 --> 24:50.796
Let's load the droid in the tank.

24:50.921 --> 24:52.615
We'll inspect it on the go.

25:09.228 --> 25:10.299
In range.

25:11.608 --> 25:12.760
Take the shot.

25:16.307 --> 25:17.807
Protect the Captain.

25:29.673 --> 25:30.973
Commando droids.

25:36.837 --> 25:38.703
Jesse, you better get back here.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.127
What do you have?

25:46.295 --> 25:49.197
We've broken the access codes and
powered up the droid's guidance system.

25:49.322 --> 25:50.759
According to his memory logs,

25:50.884 --> 25:52.862
he fired the emergency thrusters
on the escape pod

25:52.987 --> 25:54.427
to avoid a mid-air collision.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.718
- Collision with what?
- Another escape pod.

25:56.843 --> 25:59.048
There was no time to correct
for the steeper glide path,

25:59.173 --> 26:01.392
which is why
this droid's pod crashed.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.921
Can you pinpoint the landing zone
for the other pod?

26:04.046 --> 26:06.236
I can put us within
two to three klicks of it, sir.

26:06.361 --> 26:07.561
Alert the men.

26:07.751 --> 26:09.484
We've picked up the scent.

26:10.276 --> 26:11.068
How bad?

26:11.236 --> 26:12.110
Pretty bad.

26:12.235 --> 26:14.906
I need to remove his armor
to see the full extent of the damage.

26:15.075 --> 26:17.171
Those snipers
might have called for backup.

26:17.296 --> 26:19.613
Unless we want to start
getting picked off one by one,

26:19.738 --> 26:21.496
we should find a better cover first.

26:23.110 --> 26:24.310
Wait a minute.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.836
Those critters are domesticated.

26:28.252 --> 26:29.837
I think we're on farmland,

26:30.144 --> 26:33.426
and where there's a farm,
there's a usually a farmer.

26:34.013 --> 26:35.551
Let's find his homestead.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.529
We want no trouble here.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.648
Easy with that weapon, ma'am.

26:58.069 --> 26:59.283
We're here as friends.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.786
- State your business.
- Our Captain's been hurt. We need...

27:01.954 --> 27:04.705
- I'm no doctor, so just...
- We have a medic, ma'am.

27:04.874 --> 27:07.458
We just need a place
to tend him overnight.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.126
- Who's...
- Get back inside, both you.

27:10.562 --> 27:11.450
Mom.

27:11.575 --> 27:13.547
There are some benches out
back in the barn.

27:14.294 --> 27:17.394
- It's the best I can do.
- That'll be fine, ma'am.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.380
What?

27:24.624 --> 27:25.590
What happened?

27:25.847 --> 27:27.562
Commando droids took a potshot.

27:27.731 --> 27:29.459
That would've gone
through your heart

27:29.584 --> 27:31.315
had it been two inches to the left.

27:31.486 --> 27:32.775
I can't move my arm.

27:32.944 --> 27:35.644
- You have some nerve damage.
- Understood.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.835
Now patch me up
and let's get on with it.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.799
Sir, you're in no condition.

27:40.924 --> 27:43.124
It will heal, but it'll take time.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.346
We're getting under way, Kix.
That's an order.

27:46.672 --> 27:48.797
Sir, as the team medic,

27:48.922 --> 27:51.943
when it comes to the health of the men,
including you,

27:52.068 --> 27:53.254
I outrank everyone.

27:53.738 --> 27:57.425
So, I respectfully order you, sir,
to get some...

27:57.655 --> 27:58.655
Excuse me.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.199
- If there's not enough...
- That's plenty.

28:02.324 --> 28:03.924
- Thank you...
- Suu.

28:06.769 --> 28:08.869
I told you to stay in the house.

28:09.361 --> 28:10.813
I couldn't help it, mom.

28:10.988 --> 28:12.088
It got away.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.260
You look like my daddy.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.173
Don't bother the soldier.

28:21.298 --> 28:24.118
- Now get inside with your brother.
- Yes, mom.

28:24.359 --> 28:25.759
My husband is away

28:26.404 --> 28:28.354
delivering our first harvest.

28:28.864 --> 28:30.814
Do you require anything else?

28:38.759 --> 28:40.709
Resume the search without me.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.578
You're in command.

28:43.056 --> 28:44.206
I'll be fine.

28:56.618 --> 28:58.268
There's our escape pod.

28:59.799 --> 29:01.197
Any sign of Grievous?

29:01.799 --> 29:03.351
It looks deserted.

29:04.502 --> 29:07.152
He must be heading
to a second escape pod.

29:07.862 --> 29:10.748
- Captain Rex, come in, please.
- It's Jesse, sir.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.292
- <i>Rex was injured.</i>
- What's his condition?

29:13.461 --> 29:16.337
He'll be fine,
but we had to find him shelter tonight.

29:16.506 --> 29:17.832
Grievous is on the move.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.266
We're headed to the west.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.967
Swing around and we can meet up
at the final escape pod.

29:22.136 --> 29:24.674
<i>We're going to need
all the firepower we can muster.</i>

29:24.799 --> 29:27.549
Roger that, sir.
We're speeding towards you.

30:12.328 --> 30:14.316
We should be there by now!

30:14.813 --> 30:18.034
We are, sir, there.

30:18.159 --> 30:19.614
Almost.

30:20.027 --> 30:23.427
You had better be interpreting
the coordinates correctly.

30:28.029 --> 30:29.638
We're almost there, sir.

30:29.763 --> 30:31.763
One klick out. Straight ahead.

30:33.100 --> 30:36.010
I'm losing power.

31:10.804 --> 31:11.904
Who are you?

31:12.537 --> 31:14.237
What are you doing here?

31:18.793 --> 31:19.794
You're a clone.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.087
So...

31:21.582 --> 31:24.828
I see the war has finally
made its way out here,

31:25.176 --> 31:28.476
and I guess I can expect
a visit from some droids soon.

31:28.864 --> 31:30.764
What's your number and rank?

31:32.611 --> 31:35.345
My name is Lawquane. Cut Lawquane.

31:36.067 --> 31:37.561
And I'm just a simple farmer.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.129
You're a deserter.

31:40.988 --> 31:44.360
I like to think I'm merely exercising
my freedom to choose:

31:44.862 --> 31:46.729
to choose not to kill for a living.

31:46.854 --> 31:48.954
That is not your choice to make.

31:49.487 --> 31:52.576
You swore an oath to the Republic.
You have a duty.

31:52.988 --> 31:54.888
I have a duty, you're right.

31:55.409 --> 31:57.011
But it's to my family.

31:57.686 --> 32:00.501
Does that count,
or do you still plan to turn me in?

32:00.669 --> 32:02.719
- Do I have a choice?
- Daddy!

32:02.963 --> 32:04.063
You're home!

32:05.474 --> 32:07.216
Look what I drew you, dad!

32:09.600 --> 32:10.844
That's great, Jek.

32:10.969 --> 32:12.619
I see you two have met.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.140
He looks just like you, daddy.
I told him.

32:16.680 --> 32:17.680
You did.

32:18.559 --> 32:20.813
I was just making our guest,
Captain...

32:21.743 --> 32:23.193
What's your number?

32:23.586 --> 32:25.714
I also have a name,
believe it or not.

32:25.839 --> 32:26.986
He was injured.

32:27.236 --> 32:28.740
His men brought him here.

32:28.865 --> 32:31.240
I told him he could stay
just for the night.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.669
Of course he can.

32:32.794 --> 32:35.327
We never turn away
those in need, do we?

32:35.495 --> 32:38.493
No, we always help anyone we can.

32:38.618 --> 32:39.540
Right.

32:39.921 --> 32:42.042
You look hungry, Rex.

32:42.283 --> 32:44.350
No, I'm fine. I'll stay here.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.882
- You have to eat with us. Please.
- Please?

32:48.255 --> 32:50.426
They're never going
to stop till you say yes.

32:50.594 --> 32:52.136
All right. I'll join you.

33:05.850 --> 33:09.050
You and I may be clones,
but we're still individuals.

33:09.797 --> 33:13.056
You have a name rather
than a number, Captain. Why is that?

33:13.181 --> 33:16.939
Perhaps our leaders feel it's a more
efficient way of distinguishing us.

33:17.064 --> 33:19.014
More efficient than a number?

33:19.663 --> 33:22.011
I doubt the Kaminoans
think that way.

33:22.136 --> 33:23.015
Still,

33:23.140 --> 33:25.248
a name has to make you feel unique,

33:25.373 --> 33:28.220
especially in an army where everyone
looks like you and talks...

33:28.345 --> 33:30.953
Actually,
I never really thought about it.

33:31.078 --> 33:33.487
Yes, you have.
How would you know?

33:33.747 --> 33:37.681
Because I'm as close to you
as any life-form can be.

33:40.218 --> 33:43.020
I've seen how you look at my family,
our home.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.567
Come on, Rex, admit it. You've thought
about what your life could look like

33:48.735 --> 33:52.335
if you were to also leave the army,
choose the life you want.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.106
What if I am choosing
the life I want?

33:55.315 --> 33:58.494
What if I'm staying in the army
because it's meaningful to me?

33:58.662 --> 34:00.412
And how is it meaningful?

34:01.164 --> 34:04.997
Because I'm part of the most pivotal
moment in the history of the Republic.

34:05.122 --> 34:08.253
If we fail,
then our children and their children

34:08.420 --> 34:11.920
could be forced to live
under an evil I can't well imagine.

34:12.300 --> 34:15.199
If you were to have children,
of course, but...

34:15.347 --> 34:17.654
that would be against the rules,
wouldn't it?

34:17.779 --> 34:20.289
Isn't that what somebody
programmed you to believe, Captain?

34:20.414 --> 34:22.802
No, Cut. It's simply what I believe.

34:23.013 --> 34:26.110
It doesn't matter if it's my children
or other people's children.

34:26.235 --> 34:27.981
Does that meet with your approval?

34:28.326 --> 34:31.275
Perfectly. To each his own.
That's what I always say.

34:31.594 --> 34:33.152
What does that mean, daddy?

34:33.277 --> 34:36.197
It means you can do anything
with your life that you want to.

34:42.371 --> 34:45.623
- How are you doing, Jesse?
- Closing in, sir. We have a visual.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.342
Very well.
We'll meet you in the middle.

34:53.420 --> 34:55.612
Is your transmitter working?

34:55.853 --> 34:58.153
I don't know. I haven't used it yet.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.681
All right. I'll check on it.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.016
Stupid battle droids.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.685
Sir, you made it.

35:04.984 --> 35:07.690
Get back in the pod
and send out a distress signal

35:07.815 --> 35:09.809
towards the rest of our fleet.

35:09.934 --> 35:13.152
We need to get a shuttle
down here immediately.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.877
Roger, roger.
But I must inform you, sir,

35:16.002 --> 35:19.604
there are multiple life-forms
approaching from the east and west.

35:19.729 --> 35:21.535
Battle positions!

35:24.891 --> 35:26.156
Good move.

35:26.634 --> 35:28.041
Very good move.

35:28.547 --> 35:29.752
So what was it?

35:29.920 --> 35:31.587
What made me decide
to leave the corps?

35:35.011 --> 35:36.798
Shortly after
the battle of Geonosis,

35:36.923 --> 35:40.320
our troop transport got caught
between two Separatist gunships.

35:40.445 --> 35:42.450
They fired at us
with everything they had.

35:42.575 --> 35:46.125
We crashed. Most of us were
either dead or severely injured.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.862
So when they started working
their way through the wounded,

35:48.987 --> 35:50.237
killing us off,

35:50.438 --> 35:52.538
I knew there was no hope. I ran.

35:54.646 --> 35:56.096
It still haunts me.

35:57.338 --> 35:58.338
I'm sorry.

35:58.823 --> 36:02.103
It's the day I felt
my life didn't have any meaning.

36:02.405 --> 36:05.375
Everyone I cared about,
my team, was gone.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.458
I was just another expendable clone

36:09.626 --> 36:13.630
waiting for my turn to be slaughtered
in a war that made no sense to me.

36:14.279 --> 36:16.048
Can you understand that, Rex?

36:17.170 --> 36:20.420
I've been in countless battles
and lost many brothers.

36:20.859 --> 36:22.359
They were my family.

36:22.673 --> 36:23.673
My home.

36:28.884 --> 36:30.810
Daddy, we finished our chores.

36:30.935 --> 36:33.571
- Can we go outside and play?
- Please?

36:34.625 --> 36:36.262
Okay, only for a few minutes.

36:36.387 --> 36:38.034
Thank you, daddy.
Come on, Jek.

36:38.159 --> 36:39.530
And keep the house in view.

36:39.885 --> 36:40.885
We will.

36:41.157 --> 36:43.057
You have wonderful children.

36:44.020 --> 36:45.786
I know you think I'm a coward, Rex,

36:46.737 --> 36:48.025
but believe me,

36:48.547 --> 36:51.375
I'll fight to my last breath
to keep them safe.

36:54.886 --> 36:55.704
Fire!

37:05.682 --> 37:06.974
Tank two! Port side!

37:10.162 --> 37:11.145
Great shot!

37:11.587 --> 37:13.139
Where is that ship?

37:16.781 --> 37:17.781
Shaeeah?

37:18.489 --> 37:19.689
Where are you?

37:22.129 --> 37:23.579
Where are you?

37:24.445 --> 37:25.945
Stop fooling around.

37:27.942 --> 37:29.163
You are not funny.

37:29.331 --> 37:30.331
Am too.

37:32.522 --> 37:33.522
Look.

37:34.059 --> 37:35.209
In the field.

37:35.534 --> 37:36.584
What is it?

37:37.707 --> 37:39.423
It wasn't there before.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.326
It's some kind of spaceship,
I think.

37:43.845 --> 37:44.845
Hello?

37:47.611 --> 37:49.761
Do you think somebody's in there?

38:08.328 --> 38:09.442
I didn't do it.

38:09.567 --> 38:10.568
You did.

38:17.260 --> 38:18.416
Monsters!

38:28.086 --> 38:30.986
- What's wrong?
- Monsters. They're chasing us.

38:31.199 --> 38:33.393
What monsters?
Honey, where?

38:35.105 --> 38:37.564
They hatched
from the big egg in the field.

38:42.534 --> 38:44.525
This is not good.
I count 20.

38:44.650 --> 38:46.239
Cut, what's out there?

38:46.407 --> 38:47.707
Commando droids.

38:48.307 --> 38:49.807
What are they doing?

38:50.274 --> 38:53.174
- Suu, get the kids upstairs.
- Come. Come now.

38:56.728 --> 38:58.478
What weapons do you have?

39:00.275 --> 39:02.514
We can catch them in a cross fire.
You take that corner.

39:02.639 --> 39:05.425
No, Captain.
With respect, you're not in charge here.

39:06.068 --> 39:07.261
I can be useful.

39:08.897 --> 39:11.556
You're injured.
You have only one good arm.

39:11.832 --> 39:13.132
But I can fight.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.351
So can I.

39:14.821 --> 39:18.421
Rex, I need you to be the last line
of defense for my family.

39:23.282 --> 39:24.932
I'll take care of them.

39:25.717 --> 39:26.717
Thank you.

39:56.399 --> 39:57.400
Finally!

39:58.051 --> 39:59.470
General Grievous, sir.

39:59.595 --> 40:02.395
We see you below us.
Are you ready to depart?

40:03.401 --> 40:05.819
Concentrate your fire on that ship.

40:09.952 --> 40:11.359
They're shooting at us.

40:11.484 --> 40:12.951
Coming back around.

40:15.744 --> 40:18.373
Sir, that ship's coming around
for another landing attempt.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.959
Keep firing.
Don't let that ship land.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.827
The guns are overheated!

40:23.087 --> 40:26.173
Always something.
Cody, Jesse, cover me.

40:27.071 --> 40:28.784
General, behind you!

41:02.043 --> 41:03.693
They're coming for you!

41:33.344 --> 41:34.344
Daddy?

41:34.993 --> 41:35.993
I'm okay.

41:37.193 --> 41:38.193
It's over.

41:47.148 --> 41:48.897
Forget trying to land!

41:55.763 --> 41:57.113
Fire the engines.

42:01.170 --> 42:02.696
Jedi scum.

42:05.621 --> 42:07.271
Are you all right, sir?

42:08.124 --> 42:10.324
We're right back where we started.

42:10.517 --> 42:11.538
Call the cruisers.

42:11.663 --> 42:14.156
- See if they can stop that ship.
- Right away, sir.

42:14.324 --> 42:17.074
And tell them to send
someone to pick us up.

42:24.167 --> 42:25.009
All right,

42:25.134 --> 42:27.335
- that should do it.
- Captain Rex.

42:27.810 --> 42:29.754
Are you going to turn in my husband?

42:29.922 --> 42:31.922
I'm sorry, Suu.
It's my duty,

42:33.796 --> 42:37.220
but in my condition,
I probably won't remember any of this.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.388
Thank you.

42:38.864 --> 42:40.700
You're still a deserter, Cut,

42:40.825 --> 42:42.386
but you're certainly not a coward.

42:42.511 --> 42:44.478
<i>Captain Rex, are you still with us?</i>

42:44.646 --> 42:45.970
Yes, General Kenobi.

42:46.095 --> 42:48.607
I'm still with you
and thankfully on the mend, sir.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.692
That's great news.
We certainly missed you at the party.

42:51.817 --> 42:52.986
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

42:53.506 --> 42:54.988
I had to attend one of my own.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.908
Can't wait to hear about it.
We're standing by.

42:58.397 --> 43:00.202
You're welcome to stay, Rex.

43:00.535 --> 43:02.185
This is your home, Cut.

43:02.872 --> 43:03.872
My family

43:04.445 --> 43:05.595
is elsewhere.

43:17.845 --> 43:20.495
May The Team Be With You
