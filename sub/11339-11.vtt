WEBVTT

00:04.971 --> 00:06.370
I understand, Hotch.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.701
Take all the time you need.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.707
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll be fine.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.813
Okay. You, too.

00:15.715 --> 00:16.682
Hi.

00:16.816 --> 00:18.875
I was hoping I could get a minute.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.853
Agent Seaver has requested
her remedial training be here.

00:22.989 --> 00:25.389
She was only cleared for one case.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.119
That didn't end
the way she had hoped.

00:28.261 --> 00:30.195
I'd say.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.560
She made a mistake.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.167
But she remained calm under pressure.

00:35.301 --> 00:36.461
She just wants to prove herself.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.537
Hotch isn't here to supervise her.

00:38.671 --> 00:40.366
I'll do it. I'll be her training agent.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.099
He signed off?

00:42.242 --> 00:44.403
Via email. But I know
you have a history with her.

00:47.414 --> 00:48.745
Don't make me regret this.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.180
Thank you.

00:51.317 --> 00:52.545
Ma'am.

00:52.685 --> 00:53.879
Agent.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.988
Have you heard from Aaron?

00:56.122 --> 00:58.113
He sounds like he hadn't slept.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.658
Do you think he's all right?

01:00.794 --> 01:02.193
Jack's having some problems.

01:02.328 --> 01:05.126
Well, it's been a year since...

01:05.265 --> 01:08.200
Well, I'm glad he's finally
taking some time off.

01:08.334 --> 01:10.427
This is the only thing that's pending.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.233
Donald Sanderson?

01:14.374 --> 01:15.602
That was 20 years ago.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.607
25, actually. He's up for parole.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.178
They've asked us
to do a risk assessment.

01:20.313 --> 01:22.372
Well, I can't do it,
not with Aaron gone.

01:22.515 --> 01:24.278
Well, who can?

01:27.887 --> 01:29.445
Morgan, can you come in here?

01:32.358 --> 01:33.655
Well, he's he's got to meet him today.

01:33.793 --> 01:35.852
The parole board hearing is tomorrow.

01:35.995 --> 01:37.656
Now, what was his story?

01:37.797 --> 01:40.163
Junkies randomly attacked his family?

01:40.300 --> 01:41.528
Yes, that's what he claimed.

01:41.668 --> 01:44.159
He and his son survived.
Frankly, I don't understand

01:44.304 --> 01:46.169
how parole is even a consideration.

01:46.306 --> 01:49.173
Well, he's eligible. They're overcrowded.

01:49.309 --> 01:50.901
Yes, but the physical evidence
was shocking.

01:51.044 --> 01:53.877
Who could possibly believe
he would be innocent?

01:54.013 --> 01:55.742
That's not our job.

01:55.882 --> 01:59.249
All we need to see is how 25 years
has changed his life.

02:01.821 --> 02:03.413
Ma'am.

02:03.556 --> 02:04.853
Is everything all right?

02:06.025 --> 02:07.686
I need you to take a trip.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.593
Who's this?

02:12.732 --> 02:14.029
Don Sanderson.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.794
He's been in Petersburg half his life

02:15.935 --> 02:17.061
and he's up for parole.

02:17.203 --> 02:19.501
It appears
he's become a model prisoner.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.766
You don't sound convinced.

02:21.908 --> 02:24.775
I don't know how someone
who kills his wife and daughter

02:24.911 --> 02:26.936
can be rehabilitated.

02:29.816 --> 02:30.976
Open 7.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.315
On the gate.

02:37.457 --> 02:38.924
SSA Derek Morgan.

02:39.058 --> 02:41.754
BAU.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.886
You analyze behavior.

02:44.964 --> 02:47.330
Close it.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.464
Nobody's ever believed
that I'm innocent.

02:52.605 --> 02:53.629
Why would you?

02:54.741 --> 02:56.709
- May I?
- Yeah.

03:02.415 --> 03:05.646
I don't rely solely on physical evidence.

03:09.088 --> 03:11.215
It says here that you were
two years into your residency

03:11.357 --> 03:12.289
when all this happened.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.325
What did you want to specialize in?

03:14.460 --> 03:16.451
Pediatrics.

03:20.266 --> 03:23.167
You haven't requested parole
in over 18 years.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.762
The system put me in here.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.429
They're gonna keep me in here.

03:27.574 --> 03:31.374
Time's gone by a little faster
since I accepted that.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.207
Has the heroin helped you
pass the time?

03:34.347 --> 03:39.011
They found it in your cell two years ago.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.744
New regime had to assert power.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.149
You're saying someone planted it.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.222
Oh.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.222
It is what it is.

03:46.359 --> 03:48.725
You hadn't been in solitary
since you got here.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.321
Gave me a lot of time
to think about my son.

03:56.336 --> 03:57.860
Your son's name is Joshua?

03:59.372 --> 04:02.808
I'm sorry. I still don't understand
how... how you're...

04:02.942 --> 04:04.170
gonna ignore all that evidence.

04:04.310 --> 04:08.644
The prosecution said that I had
an acute psychological break,

04:08.781 --> 04:10.339
that I was a psychopath.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.348
Is that what you see?

04:12.485 --> 04:15.318
Psychopaths are masters
at hiding what's inside of them.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.921
Is that what you think I've done?

04:24.197 --> 04:27.325
Agent, do you have
any idea what it's like

04:27.467 --> 04:30.197
to be accused of something
that you didn't do?

04:32.972 --> 04:36.305
You went to the infirmary 16 times,

04:36.442 --> 04:38.774
and not once did you
ever try to fight back.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.338
No.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.007
The last time they beat me, they...

04:48.187 --> 04:49.245
well...

04:49.389 --> 04:50.447
I... I almost had it.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.785
I mean, I didn't think
that I was gonna make it.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.122
And I was okay with that.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.899
But I was lying there...

05:02.035 --> 05:06.495
and I had this, uh...

05:06.639 --> 05:07.799
vision.

05:13.579 --> 05:17.106
See, Joshua was, uh... was grown up.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.718
The sun was shining on us.

05:19.852 --> 05:23.515
I... I don't know where we were.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.352
But I got to tell him

05:26.492 --> 05:30.519
that I didn't hurt our family.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.834
And that's what's kept you going?

05:37.203 --> 05:40.866
I thought just didn't want
to feel sorry for myself.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.101
I wanted... I wanted to...
to live my life in here

05:44.243 --> 05:46.473
the way that I would
have lived it out there

05:46.612 --> 05:50.343
and do things
that I got cheated out of

05:50.483 --> 05:51.780
with Joshua.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.382
Is that why you've
taught men how to read?

05:57.390 --> 06:00.223
Why you started a mentor program?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.590
You've helped...

06:02.729 --> 06:05.289
41 inmates get their GED.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.966
Mr. Sanderson, this is
the type of evidence I consider.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.170
If you were to gain your freedom,
what would you do with it?

06:18.311 --> 06:21.747
I can't even think
about something like that.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.611
But what would you do?

06:29.288 --> 06:31.722
I would try and find my son.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.226
And I'd tell him the truth.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.074

07:13.132 --> 07:16.158
Based on physical evidence,

07:16.302 --> 07:20.261
Don Sanderson has been prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

07:20.406 --> 07:25.708
But the way in which he
has spent the last 25 years...

07:27.480 --> 07:28.970
it throws doubt on that conviction.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.710
Now, I know that is not
the question at hand here today.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.150
I have learned that behavior does not lie.

07:37.290 --> 07:42.023
You all want to know whether or not
this man has been reformed.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.393
I believe that he has.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.324
He's lost everything,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.903
yet somehow he has still
managed to better himself.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.733
More importantly, the people around him.

07:56.309 --> 08:00.405
He's held on to the only
good thing left in his life...

08:00.546 --> 08:01.877
his son.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.782
It's what defines him.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.816
At this point,

08:08.955 --> 08:11.389
he's simply looking ahead.

08:12.391 --> 08:14.552
Therefore,

08:14.694 --> 08:16.423
it is my belief that Don Sanderson

08:16.562 --> 08:19.326
is not a danger to himself or to society.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.707
Goodbye, now.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.945
I, uh, noticed you all drink double shots.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.672
Oh, thanks. You do, too?

09:42.815 --> 09:44.043
This is a first.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.980
I wanted to thank you
for having my back.

09:47.553 --> 09:48.747
I hope you have mine.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.524
Front page news, huh?

09:52.658 --> 09:53.852
Morgan must not think he did it.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.325
Or believes he won't do it again.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.327
Is Agent Morgan in?

09:58.464 --> 09:59.453
What do you need, Erin?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.159
Metro P.D. Sent this an hour ago.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.201
And they want us to take a look?

10:04.337 --> 10:07.067
No, they want you to take a look.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.468
Who's this?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.910
The man Don Sanderson just murdered.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.190
<i>There is no such thing as part freedom.</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:04.057
<i>Nelson Mandela.</i>

11:25.918 --> 11:27.909
Why didn't Sanderson just run?

11:28.054 --> 11:30.784
Maybe he wanted to go back to prison.

11:30.923 --> 11:33.858
There are plenty of ways to violate
your parole other than homicide.

11:35.661 --> 11:38.152
- Is Morgan okay?
- He just vouched for a man

11:38.297 --> 11:41.266
that turned around
and killed someone.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.066
So he's the one who let him out?

11:46.205 --> 11:47.934
Come on, Bill,
you know it's never that simple.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.564
Oh, you see this all the time, Rossi.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.075
Guy's out for a couple of days,
he's gotta get back inside.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.644
They why did he claim self-defense?

11:53.779 --> 11:54.905
Why call the paramedics?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.947
Why attempt CPR
to keep him breathing?

11:57.083 --> 11:58.380
Why not just flee the scene?

11:58.517 --> 11:59.541
He wanted something else.

11:59.685 --> 12:00.743
Like what?

12:00.886 --> 12:01.910
I don't know yet.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.612
Well, he's predictable, if you ask me.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.417
He broke into this guy's basement
and stabbed him,

12:05.558 --> 12:07.492
same way he did his wife.

12:07.626 --> 12:11.357
Rossi, he's coming with us.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.629
Get out of the car.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.632
Let's go, move.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.996
You're welcome to join us.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.669
After I clean up here.

12:26.011 --> 12:27.979
This is not a random act of violence.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.741
There has to be a reason.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.747
Anything could have been a weapon.

12:31.884 --> 12:35.285
So he chose to stab him,
just like he did before.

12:37.289 --> 12:38.256
Hello, Tommy.

12:38.390 --> 12:40.085
Aah!

13:19.698 --> 13:21.427
So he dialed 911,

13:21.567 --> 13:23.330
then he performed CPR.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.336
Why go through this big fight
and then try and save him?

13:28.440 --> 13:31.341
So the gun wasn't loaded,
but he broke in, took it,

13:31.477 --> 13:33.468
and waited for Wittman
to get home? Why?

13:33.612 --> 13:34.601
<i>I don't know, love,</i>

13:34.747 --> 13:37.807
but I do know that your victim
legally purchased that.38

13:37.950 --> 13:40.384
in '94, licensed to him.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.146
Other than that, no weapons,
wives, or children.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.550
The guy was pretty much a loner.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.281
So there's gotta be
some sort of connection.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.721
There isn't any yet. I'm sorry.

13:46.859 --> 13:47.848
All right. Thank you, Garcia.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.688
Yeah, hey, how is my boy?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.194
Uh, fine.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.524
Really?

13:52.665 --> 13:53.632
No.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.165
Oh.

13:57.703 --> 14:00.263
The bullets were in the other room,
but the gun is right here.

14:00.406 --> 14:03.375
Maybe killing him was an accident?

14:03.509 --> 14:06.034
Does any of this strike you
as hard to believe?

14:06.178 --> 14:08.043
Neighbors confirmed hearing
sounds of a confrontation.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.115
Yeah, but Sanderson was out
of prison for what, Reid?

14:11.250 --> 14:13.218
At the time of the murder, 51 hours.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.252
He's free for two days and change?

14:15.387 --> 14:17.480
What's the big hurry to find this guy?

14:19.658 --> 14:24.322
You woke up a free man
and decided to kill Tom Wittman.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.761
You gotta help us out here.
It doesn't look good for you.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.526
It wasn't supposed to be like that.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.828
He came at me.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.598
I get it that you don't
trust anyone right now,

14:33.739 --> 14:36.401
but this man is the reason
that you're free.

14:42.781 --> 14:43.907
Did you find your son?

14:44.049 --> 14:46.108
No.

14:46.252 --> 14:47.947
Did you even look?

14:51.924 --> 14:53.448
Drive.

14:59.632 --> 15:00.599
How is he?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.598
Clearing his head.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.896
Strauss is waiting
for you guys to come back.

15:05.037 --> 15:06.800
Great. That's all he needs.

15:06.939 --> 15:07.871
We still don't know

15:08.007 --> 15:10.441
how Tom Wittman is connected
to Don Sanderson.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.510
All we know about him
is everything Morgan went over,

15:12.645 --> 15:13.577
what he was accused of.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.737
And that he killed
Tom Whitman this morning.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.644
The guy's not talking.

15:17.783 --> 15:18.909
He doesn't trust anybody.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.746
If he doesn't tell us
who Tom Wittman is,

15:20.886 --> 15:22.751
how are we going to help Derek?

15:22.888 --> 15:26.984
The answer's in there somewhere.
We just have to find it.

15:27.126 --> 15:28.650
All right, March 10, 1985,

15:28.794 --> 15:30.091
2:23 a.m.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.821
Don Sanderson was asleep on his couch

15:31.964 --> 15:33.795
because of an argument
he had with his wife.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.059
He woke up to her screams.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.498
He ran to the bedroom
to find one man stabbing her.

15:37.636 --> 15:39.831
Another man struck him from behind,
knocking him unconscious.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.405
His wounds were superficial
in comparison,

15:41.540 --> 15:43.508
so it was easy for
the prosecution to claim

15:43.642 --> 15:45.507
that Sanderson's wounds
were self-inflicted.

15:45.644 --> 15:48.272
And he had just finished
his second year of residency

15:48.414 --> 15:51.008
at Georgetown, indicating he had
the skills to do it to himself.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.845
And his fingerprints
were all over the weapon.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.543
So Sanderson comes to.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.450
His wife and daughter are dead.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.488
Almost dead. He called for help.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.750
Sounds familiar.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.723
He said that two men killed his wife,

16:01.860 --> 16:02.952
but when officers arrived,
he changed his story.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.027
He added a woman.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.357
Let me guess.
They never found her.

16:05.497 --> 16:07.089
No one ever looked.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.826
So wait, three people
commit a brutal double homicide,

16:09.969 --> 16:11.095
then never act on it again?

16:11.236 --> 16:12.931
I don't know, it seems unlikely.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.664
But nothing like that ever happened
after Sanderson went to prison.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.604
The question is,

16:16.742 --> 16:19.267
how does Tom Wittman play into this?
He was a teenager at the time.

16:19.411 --> 16:20.571
Strauss.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.874
I want everything from
Tom Wittman's apartment.

16:23.015 --> 16:24.141
It's on its way.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.777
Do you think Wittman
was there that night?

16:26.919 --> 16:28.853
- That depends.
- On what?

16:28.988 --> 16:31.286
If you believe Sanderson's story.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.027
My office will handle
the press from here on.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.532
That's unnecessary.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.569
You don't need any more distractions.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.668
He looks genuinely distraught.

16:49.808 --> 16:51.366
He's very convincing.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.876
I can see why you fell for it.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.209
I don't need to remind you

16:56.348 --> 16:58.043
that your reputation's
on the line here.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.707
That's not what matters
to me right now.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.519
It should.

17:24.309 --> 17:25.241
You played me.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.605
I know how this looks.

17:26.744 --> 17:27.712
Oh, do you?

17:27.846 --> 17:29.473
Oh, well, please, enlighten me.

17:29.615 --> 17:30.741
How does this look?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.111
I didn't do it.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.310
Yes, you did!

17:34.453 --> 17:36.614
And now that's on me.

17:36.755 --> 17:39.223
I bought in to your
holier-than-thou garbage!

17:39.358 --> 17:41.952
I put a psychotic killer
back out on the street,

17:42.094 --> 17:44.995
and in less than 51 hours,
you went right back to your old ways.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.033
- I didn't want to.
- Then why did you?

17:50.569 --> 17:51.831
Because he would have killed me.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.961
No. No.

17:54.106 --> 17:55.198
It's more than that.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.399
It better be more than that.

17:58.477 --> 18:01.037
Why did you go to his house?

18:01.180 --> 18:03.774
Why would you risk your freedom
to go after this man?

18:09.388 --> 18:12.152
This is the rest
of Tom Wittman's house.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.953
Okay, guys. Derek said that
the Sandersons got into an argument

18:15.094 --> 18:16.755
on the night of the murders.

18:16.895 --> 18:19.557
So I went ahead
and did a background check.

18:19.698 --> 18:23.134
There is no history of abuse,
domestic calls, therapy.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.133
From the outside in,
they were like the perfect family.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.033
Nobody's perfect.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.299
Yeah, but married
right out of college,

18:29.441 --> 18:30.931
medical school, two kids,

18:31.076 --> 18:32.976
house on a hill, dog.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.636
Pretty damn close, yeah?

18:34.780 --> 18:36.941
Okay, so one night they argue.

18:37.082 --> 18:38.106
He takes the couch,

18:38.250 --> 18:40.150
leaving the wife and kids
upstairs vulnerable.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.150
He claims the offenders
broke in through the basement.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.755
There were security bars on the window,
but they were old and broken.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.118
That was such an obscure fact, though.

18:46.258 --> 18:48.624
It was deemed only someone
with an intimate knowledge of the house

18:48.760 --> 18:50.284
would suggest that as an entry point.

18:50.429 --> 18:53.125
Yeah, but that means that three people
walked past Sanderson

18:53.265 --> 18:54.630
while he was sleeping on the couch.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.393
Why didn't he wake up?

18:56.535 --> 18:58.730
And why would they walk right past him
without subduing him?

18:58.871 --> 19:00.395
It looks like their goal was upstairs.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.666
She had a stuffed animal.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.537
Who does that to a 5-year-old?

19:04.676 --> 19:06.109
You know, the child
was an afterthought.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.736
The overkill was on Mrs. Sanderson.

19:08.881 --> 19:09.905
That's an understatement.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.209
He was sending a message.

19:12.351 --> 19:13.340
Like what?

19:13.485 --> 19:16.477
He's in control.
He has all the power.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.055
And he hates her.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.188
You must be exhausted.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.229
Doing good time just so you
can get out and kill again.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.356
I'm not a murderer.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.764
You are a murderer.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.530
You just stabbed a man to death.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.036
I didn't have a choice.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.634
He saw me, he panicked,
he would have killed me.

19:37.776 --> 19:40.142
I'm telling you,
I didn't have a choice.

19:40.279 --> 19:42.577
He didn't kill my family.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.807
He was going to lead me
to the one who did.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.781
All right.

19:46.919 --> 19:50.355
And if you had gotten to this person
that allegedly killed your family,

19:50.489 --> 19:51.478
what were you gonna do then,

19:51.623 --> 19:53.250
the same thing you just did
to Tom Wittman?

19:53.392 --> 19:55.223
No, I'm not a killer.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.223
Okay, yes.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.196
Yes. There wasn't a day
that I was locked up

20:01.333 --> 20:05.633
where I didn't hope that whoever took
my family's lives was dead.

20:07.306 --> 20:08.432
I wanted to find him

20:08.574 --> 20:10.303
and I wanted to destroy his life
like he did mine.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.774
I wanted him... wanted him to pay!

20:15.847 --> 20:18.873
Why wasn't Tom Wittman's name
mentioned at your trial?

20:19.017 --> 20:21.144
I didn't even know it until years later.

20:23.989 --> 20:27.049
Agent, what I saw

20:27.192 --> 20:30.252
and what happened,
that couldn't have been random.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.726
So what did you do?

20:31.863 --> 20:34.263
Just look at every single person
that knew your family?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.160
- Yeah.
- How?

20:37.302 --> 20:38.394
How did you do that?

20:38.537 --> 20:41.301
You never once asked
for access to your case.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.766
All of it was my memory.

20:46.511 --> 20:50.709
I walked through that night
a million times.

20:50.849 --> 20:55.149
Tommy was just a kid then, 18, 19.

20:55.287 --> 20:58.518
He worked at the corner market
and brought our groceries home.

20:58.657 --> 20:59.589
He and his friend,

20:59.725 --> 21:02.489
they would look for any reason
to be near my wife.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.690
I didn't like that.

21:07.833 --> 21:11.394
Carrie told him so,
and he stopped coming by.

21:11.536 --> 21:14.061
So Tom felt abandoned by your wife

21:14.206 --> 21:16.174
and angry at you, so he acted out.

21:16.308 --> 21:18.469
Yeah, you see, except...

21:18.610 --> 21:21.943
that night, he said...
he said, "That's enough."

21:25.217 --> 21:28.311
See, it's like he had actual boundaries.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.580
That's how you narrowed this down,

21:30.722 --> 21:32.485
to somebody who cared about your wife?

21:32.624 --> 21:33.886
Yeah.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.789
Tom... Tom, he was just...
he was just...

21:35.927 --> 21:38.293
He was a figure in the dark.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.493
And then I heard his voice.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.500
Good morning, Mr. Sanderson.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.399
And that was familiar.

21:48.173 --> 21:50.038
It took me a long time to place it.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.443
Anyway,

21:52.577 --> 21:57.241
a few years later, I called the market
and tried to find his full name.

21:57.382 --> 22:01.216
Thomas Gregory Wittman.

22:01.353 --> 22:05.414
I had Internet privileges once a week,

22:05.557 --> 22:06.524
and I found his address.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.319
And then what?

22:08.460 --> 22:11.429
A few days later, that heroin
was planted in my cell.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.193
I lost my privileges.

22:18.437 --> 22:21.634
So Tom Wittman was the only
link that you had

22:21.773 --> 22:23.604
to figuring out who was
in your house that night?

22:27.479 --> 22:29.276
And now I'm back to nothing.

22:31.049 --> 22:32.812
Not necessarily.

22:34.553 --> 22:37.078
You want to take him
back to his house?

22:38.223 --> 22:40.521
If he can't figure out
who else was there that night,

22:40.659 --> 22:41.990
there's no way to prove his story.

22:42.127 --> 22:43.651
All right.

22:43.795 --> 22:45.228
Let's clean him up first.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.783
This used to be a great place to live.

23:14.326 --> 23:15.452
You ready?

23:16.895 --> 23:17.919
Yeah.

23:30.108 --> 23:32.076
No one stays here long, do they?

23:34.513 --> 23:35.878
You were asleep on the couch?

23:38.350 --> 23:41.046
In front of the fire.

23:41.186 --> 23:43.154
So it was cold.

23:43.288 --> 23:45.916
Yeah.

23:46.057 --> 23:47.524
And pouring down rain.

23:48.894 --> 23:50.122
The TV was on.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.695
What were you watching?

23:51.830 --> 23:52.797
Reruns.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.456
I'd been on rotation for 36 hours.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.864
Between that and the rain,

23:58.003 --> 23:59.630
it took me about just
a minute to fall asleep.

23:59.771 --> 24:00.738
What wakes you?

24:00.872 --> 24:02.772
Daddy!
Daddy, help me, Daddy!

24:02.908 --> 24:04.739
Help! Please!

24:04.876 --> 24:06.207
Don, help, please!

24:09.448 --> 24:11.143
Don!

24:11.283 --> 24:12.250
Daddy! Daddy, help me!

24:13.852 --> 24:15.444
Uhh! Uhh! No!

24:15.587 --> 24:16.554
Shut up!

24:16.688 --> 24:17.655
He's hurting them.

24:17.789 --> 24:18.778
Who is? Tom?

24:18.924 --> 24:19.982
No, the one in the hood.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.990
- Tom's saying...
- That's enough!

24:22.127 --> 24:23.754
My little girl...

24:23.895 --> 24:26.363
She shouldn't be seeing this.

24:26.498 --> 24:27.465
Turn away, baby.

24:27.599 --> 24:28.531
Turn away.

24:28.667 --> 24:29.895
I can't get to her.

24:30.035 --> 24:31.093
- Help me!
- Shut up!

24:31.236 --> 24:32.498
No!

24:32.637 --> 24:33.865
No, no, no, no!
You stay away from her!

24:34.005 --> 24:35.563
There's a woman.
There she is.

24:35.707 --> 24:37.299
What does she look like?

24:37.442 --> 24:38.807
It's blurry.

24:38.944 --> 24:39.968
Here you go.

24:40.111 --> 24:41.840
She gave Abby her hippo.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.345
My son.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.414
She had my son.

24:45.617 --> 24:46.549
What is she saying?

24:46.685 --> 24:47.652
- Daddy.
- Stop it!

24:47.786 --> 24:48.753
That's enough!

24:48.887 --> 24:50.878
But he won't.
He keeps holding me down.

24:51.022 --> 24:52.250
He's laughing.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.824
- I want to keep him.
- He's just a baby.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.223
Put it back.

24:57.362 --> 24:58.329
No. No!

24:58.463 --> 24:59.487
- They're fighting.
- Put it back.

24:59.631 --> 25:00.757
She wants to take my son.

25:00.899 --> 25:02.127
I said put it back!

25:07.973 --> 25:09.941
They could have taken my son.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.872
But she didn't take your son.
He's safe.

25:13.278 --> 25:15.007
They must have trusted one another.

25:15.146 --> 25:18.047
We need to figure out who
Tom Wittman's friends were back then.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.152
The woman is the key.
She wanted to take the baby.

25:21.286 --> 25:24.119
Yeah. To build their own twisted family.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.918
- All right, keep me posted.
- <i>Okay.</i>

25:27.058 --> 25:31.188
Okay, the crazy thing about this
is that nobody turned on one another.

25:31.329 --> 25:32.796
So they have to have a bond.

25:32.931 --> 25:34.023
Maybe they're related.

25:34.165 --> 25:36.030
Tom Wittman didn't have any siblings.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.192
It could be childhood friends.

25:38.336 --> 25:40.736
Uh, the only marks on his record
are from juvie.

25:40.872 --> 25:41.839
He cleaned up after that.

25:41.973 --> 25:43.270
What were his arrests?

25:43.408 --> 25:44.397
Petty stuff.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.738
Uh, anything related
to breaking and entering?

25:46.878 --> 25:49.574
Credit card schemes, retail robbery.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.682
Okay, now wait.
That was big in the '80s.

25:51.816 --> 25:53.306
One person would work in the store,

25:53.451 --> 25:55.146
and the other would
use stolen credit cards.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.720
Sounds like a team.

25:56.855 --> 25:58.516
Yeah. Was he arrested with anybody?

26:01.259 --> 26:03.250
I found Tom Wittman's juvie records.

26:03.395 --> 26:07.024
Other than him, no one was underage
involved in any of his arrests.

26:07.165 --> 26:08.860
Maybe they weren't the same age.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.262
The woman wanted to keep a kid.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.494
That doesn't sound like a teenager.

26:11.636 --> 26:15.299
Okay, I'm gonna cross-ref
the date of Wittman's arrest

26:15.440 --> 26:17.806
with others made on that same day.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.002
Retail crimes. Shoplifting was very big.

26:20.145 --> 26:22.613
What about a woman who was arrested

26:22.747 --> 26:24.442
from the same department store
as Tom?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.847
Mary Rutka, 22 at the time.

26:26.985 --> 26:28.350
- Is she from D. C?
- Born and raised.

26:28.486 --> 26:29.748
Did she have any children?

26:31.022 --> 26:32.353
One 19-year-old son.

26:32.490 --> 26:34.754
Morgan, are you back yet?
We may have found the woman.

26:46.071 --> 26:47.038
That's her.

26:47.172 --> 26:48.662
Go.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.314
He's going down the fire escape!

27:33.451 --> 27:35.783
I need an ambulance
and backup at 751 Hindry Street,

27:35.920 --> 27:36.978
Northeast, Apartment 402.

27:37.122 --> 27:38.146
It's okay. It's okay. Hold on.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.295
Hey! FBI!

28:36.648 --> 28:37.580
It looks like she fought him.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.208
So some guy breaks in here,
kills her, then runs away.

28:41.352 --> 28:43.115
- It's pretty risky.
- He's hiding something,

28:43.254 --> 28:45.188
and she was a witness to it.

28:45.323 --> 28:46.722
He's cleaning up loose ends.

28:46.858 --> 28:50.350
Well, it looks like he made a mess to me.
How'd you track her down?

28:50.495 --> 28:53.157
She was arrested with
Tom Wittman a long time ago.

28:53.298 --> 28:54.265
Sanderson gets out,

28:54.399 --> 28:56.629
Wittman's killed, and now Mary Rutka.

28:56.768 --> 28:59.168
The whole thing's a house of cards.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.295
He got away with it for 20 years.

29:01.439 --> 29:04.033
He's not about to get caught now.

29:04.175 --> 29:05.233
Any leads?

29:05.376 --> 29:07.674
- Nothing more than we saw.
- Well, he knows you're on to him.

29:07.812 --> 29:09.404
What do you think he's gonna do now?

29:09.547 --> 29:11.276
Well, I don't think he'd trash
the place for the hell of it.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.408
I think he was looking for something
and we interrupted him.

29:14.552 --> 29:16.315
It makes sense
why she survived until now.

29:16.454 --> 29:17.853
What are you guys talking about?

29:17.989 --> 29:19.513
Three people got away with murder.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.253
How do you make sure
no one rats the other out?

29:23.394 --> 29:26.295
Blackmail.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.600
It sounds like we need
to profile a dormant killer.

29:30.735 --> 29:31.702
A very lucky one.

29:31.836 --> 29:33.701
He was essentially given a gift...

29:33.838 --> 29:35.601
a patsy in the form
of Don Sanderson,

29:35.740 --> 29:37.708
and he'll do anything
to protect that story.

29:37.842 --> 29:40.072
When someone has a secret this big,
everything becomes a lie.

29:40.211 --> 29:41.644
He'll most likely be pathological.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.340
So we're looking for a liar in D.C.

29:44.482 --> 29:46.473
I thought we were trying
to narrow this down.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.646
Her son's 19 years old.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.452
He doesn't have a bedroom,
but she kept all his books.

29:55.493 --> 29:57.085
She's sentimental.

30:11.943 --> 30:13.001
Hey, Morgan.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.885
Almost there.

30:21.019 --> 30:22.145
Ah, sorry.

30:25.690 --> 30:26.622
<i>Daddy help you make them?</i>

30:26.758 --> 30:28.123
- <i>Yeah.</i> 
<i>- Yeah?</i>

30:28.259 --> 30:30.090
<i>Did Josh help you make them?</i>

30:30.228 --> 30:31.695
<i>Yeah, he got the blueberries.</i>

30:31.830 --> 30:34.060
<i>He got the blue...</i> 
<i>well, thank you very much.</i>

30:34.199 --> 30:35.188
<i>I love you.</i>

30:35.333 --> 30:36.891
 <i>I love you, too.</i>

30:39.204 --> 30:41.866
<i>Welcome to the Sanderson home.</i>

30:42.006 --> 30:43.166
 <i>Don't forget the view.</i>

30:43.308 --> 30:44.798
<i>They look down on everybody.</i>

30:44.943 --> 30:46.467
He sounds jealous.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.875
- <i>Let's do this.</i> 
<i>- Shh. You'll wake them.</i>

30:49.013 --> 30:50.571
Garcia, can you isolate these images?

30:50.715 --> 30:52.012
Yeah. Which one?

30:52.150 --> 30:53.549
The one in the hood.

30:57.322 --> 30:58.516
Do you think it's him?

30:58.656 --> 31:00.487
That could be a thousand guys.

31:02.961 --> 31:04.519
I want to see them.

31:04.662 --> 31:08.223
No. I don't think that's a good idea.

31:11.336 --> 31:17.172
I wasn't allowed to have pictures
for 25 years.

31:17.308 --> 31:20.277
They thought that looking
at them would get me off.

31:23.481 --> 31:26.575
I don't want to forget my family.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.515
See, they're...

31:28.653 --> 31:32.316
they're here, and they're in flashes,

31:32.457 --> 31:35.517
but I can feel them slipping away.

31:39.631 --> 31:40.996
Please.

31:43.968 --> 31:44.957
<i>Daddy help you make them?</i>

31:45.103 --> 31:47.037
- <i>Yeah.</i> 
<i>- Yeah?</i>

31:47.171 --> 31:49.833
- <i>Did Josh help you make them?</i> 
<i>- Yeah, he got the blueberries.</i>

31:49.974 --> 31:51.839
<i>He got the blue...</i> 
<i>Well, thank you very much.</i>

31:51.976 --> 31:52.943
<i>And the butter.</i>

31:53.077 --> 31:55.944
<i>And the butter.</i> 
<i>Were you in charge of the eggs?</i>

31:56.080 --> 31:57.775
- <i>Yeah.</i> 
<i>- I know you like to break the eggs, right?</i>

31:57.916 --> 31:59.406
- <i>Yeah.</i> 
<i>- I love you.</i>

31:59.550 --> 32:01.279
 <i>I love you, too.</i>

32:09.727 --> 32:10.751
<i>Mommy...</i>

32:12.797 --> 32:14.890
<i>Go ahead. Go ahead.</i>

32:15.033 --> 32:17.627
 <i>Pancakes.</i>

32:17.769 --> 32:20.260
<i>You guys are too good to me.</i>

32:20.405 --> 32:22.236
What we just watched was...

32:22.373 --> 32:24.102
Debilitating. Frenzied.

32:24.242 --> 32:25.800
And documented,
but not for a trophy.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.502
It seems to be
from Wittman's point of view.

32:27.645 --> 32:28.805
I mean, she's obviously an accessory.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.107
Why not just destroy the evidence?

32:30.248 --> 32:32.011
Because she got something out of it.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.981
Her place was way more
than she could afford,

32:34.118 --> 32:36.848
she never got married, and she had
a son who went to private school.

32:36.988 --> 32:38.353
Do you think it's his kid?

32:38.489 --> 32:40.787
That would explain the bond

32:40.925 --> 32:43.155
and why he didn't get rid
of her before today.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.852
You said her place was nice.

32:44.996 --> 32:47.590
If he's covering his tracks,
he's paying her in cash.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.495
Who can afford to do that?

32:49.634 --> 32:52.432
You want me to find rich
and powerful men in D. C?

32:52.570 --> 32:54.094
Explain to me how
to narrow down this list.

32:54.238 --> 32:56.536
Start with me who grew up
in the District, came from nothing.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.801
His ambition will define him.

32:58.943 --> 33:00.205
Whoever did this enjoys
taking power away.

33:00.345 --> 33:02.210
He's been way too smart
to keep on killing.

33:02.347 --> 33:04.076
So what would satisfy
a guy like this?

33:04.215 --> 33:06.274
Well, he's manipulative but trustworthy.

33:06.417 --> 33:08.817
Two other people witnessed that murder,
and they never turned on him.

33:08.953 --> 33:11.513
Guys, so we have to think of this city
as the unsub's comfort zone.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.816
He didn't leave for a reason.

33:12.957 --> 33:14.322
Target-rich environment.

33:14.459 --> 33:15.391
The damage he's done

33:15.526 --> 33:17.619
and continues to do
is right here in D.C.

33:17.762 --> 33:18.888
Politics?

33:19.030 --> 33:20.361
I think it's more intimate than that.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.796
He needs victims who suffer
directly from what he's doing.

33:22.934 --> 33:24.595
Okay, I'll cross the politicians off my list.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.636
Look into asset-based lenders,

33:26.771 --> 33:29.535
uh, big money-making ventures
where people would be left in his wake.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.335
Corporate takeovers.

33:31.476 --> 33:33.535
Businessman as psychopath?

33:33.678 --> 33:36.044
They're the same characteristics.
They just use their skills differently.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.772
They both have narcissistic traits,

33:37.915 --> 33:39.883
such as a grandiose sense
of self-importance,

33:40.018 --> 33:41.349
deceptiveness, lack of remorse.

33:41.486 --> 33:43.681
Hard-core businessmen,
36 and counting.

33:43.821 --> 33:44.947
That's way too many.

33:45.089 --> 33:46.078
We can each take 6

33:46.224 --> 33:47.589
and look for connections.

33:47.725 --> 33:49.192
No, no. Wait a minute.

33:49.327 --> 33:51.227
If we had this case 25 years ago,

33:51.362 --> 33:52.488
what would we have seen?

33:52.630 --> 33:54.325
How would we fight
the physical evidence?

33:54.465 --> 33:58.401
We need look at what the unsub did
the moment he arrived at the house.

33:58.536 --> 33:59.525
They broke into the basement.

33:59.670 --> 34:02.104
Through a window with rusted-out bars.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.606
Garcia, who lived at the house
before the Sandersons?

34:04.742 --> 34:06.437
Property records...

34:06.577 --> 34:09.011
Well, it hasn't exchanged
too many hands.

34:09.147 --> 34:10.876
The Barretts, the Kramers,
the Stanworths.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.915
Any of those names
on your list of businessmen?

34:13.051 --> 34:14.848
Uh, no.
Let me look at that longer list.

34:14.985 --> 34:18.513
Hold, please.
Hey, family of James Stanworth.

34:18.656 --> 34:20.418
They lost the house in '82
and then they moved to the outskirts.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.025
He sounded jealous on the tape.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.252
That makes sense.

34:23.393 --> 34:26.090
He knew the Sandersons,
and he would obviously know that house.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.164
There was nothing random
about that attack.

34:28.299 --> 34:30.597
He's a native Washingtonian,
married with three kids.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.635
Everything to lose.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.670
- Oh.
- What?

34:35.806 --> 34:37.638
He's running for Congress.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.208
And check out his campaign slogan.

34:39.342 --> 34:42.039
"Let's do this."
He said that on the tape.

34:44.982 --> 34:46.949
This won't be easy.

34:52.456 --> 34:56.655
You want to arrest James Stanworth?
Are you out of your mind?

34:56.793 --> 34:57.726
He's got motive.

34:57.862 --> 35:00.353
Mary Rutka had a tape.
She was blackmailing him.

35:00.498 --> 35:01.897
It was a hooded figure.

35:02.033 --> 35:04.194
You can't prove it was him
on that videotape.

35:04.335 --> 35:06.064
He fits the profile, Erin.

35:06.204 --> 35:09.002
Forgive me, but your profile
sounds like a self-made man,

35:09.140 --> 35:11.700
not the psychopath you claim he is.

35:11.843 --> 35:13.071
We said he'd be destructive.

35:13.211 --> 35:15.441
In 1998 alone,

35:15.580 --> 35:17.878
he fired 6,000 people
from one of his companies.

35:18.015 --> 35:20.575
Some of those employees
took their own lives.

35:20.718 --> 35:22.948
This is the type of power
and devastation that he enjoys.

35:23.087 --> 35:24.179
Hearsay.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.654
Slander if you're not careful.

35:26.791 --> 35:30.557
Ma'am, he got into politics
to be hard on crime.

35:30.695 --> 35:33.061
He would have access
to keep tabs on Don Sanderson.

35:33.197 --> 35:36.132
And now you're sounding
as paranoid as Don Sanderson.

35:36.267 --> 35:39.430
You cannot accuse a man
without a shred of physical evidence.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.538
Mary Rutka had skin under her nails.

35:41.672 --> 35:43.264
Maybe she left a mark.

35:43.407 --> 35:47.935
And you cannot arrest a man
based on the possibility of a scratch.

35:48.079 --> 35:49.376
We can't arrest this man.

35:49.514 --> 35:50.572
That's what you mean.

35:50.715 --> 35:53.013
Don't pull any punches now, Erin.

35:55.386 --> 35:59.186
You don't understand what
the politics are, do you, Dave?

35:59.323 --> 36:00.950
You never have.

36:01.092 --> 36:02.855
No, I do.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.325
I just don't care.

36:04.462 --> 36:06.487
Ma'am, all due respect,

36:06.631 --> 36:08.599
but we have an innocent man
in our custody,

36:08.733 --> 36:10.667
and the killer is still out there.

36:10.801 --> 36:12.826
It just might be James Stanworth.

36:12.970 --> 36:14.767
You don't have enough proof.

36:15.873 --> 36:19.036
The BAU functions without you.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.474
Don't push it.

36:24.782 --> 36:27.307
So there's nothing we can do?
This guy's gonna get away with it.

36:27.451 --> 36:29.248
No. No, not a chance in hell.

36:29.387 --> 36:31.082
Garcia, find me James Stanworth right now.

36:31.222 --> 36:32.189
Yeah.

36:32.323 --> 36:33.347
Another hour passes,

36:33.491 --> 36:35.049
he's that much closer
to hiding his true self.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.421
Mary Rutka's his third victim.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.028
He's now officially a serial killer.

36:38.162 --> 36:40.562
- What do you want to do?
- I want to expose this son of a bitch.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.290
If he did kill Mary Rutka,

36:42.433 --> 36:43.991
he's gonna have cuts
on him somewhere.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.830
We match that DNA, we got him.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.198
Guys, he's having a fund-raiser

36:47.338 --> 36:48.930
- at his house in McLean.
- When?

36:49.073 --> 36:50.301
It started an hour ago.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.338
- Text me the address.
- Yep.

36:54.478 --> 36:55.945
What if we're wrong?

37:03.554 --> 37:04.578
Prentiss.

37:08.693 --> 37:11.890
Which is why I insisted
they come to D.C.,

37:12.029 --> 37:13.428
meet the policymakers,

37:13.564 --> 37:16.931
see that it's not as simple
as signing our names,

37:17.068 --> 37:20.231
that the problems we're dealing with
are not easy ones,

37:20.371 --> 37:22.737
that we have to plan
not two steps ahead,

37:22.873 --> 37:24.568
but 200 steps,

37:24.709 --> 37:28.406
that it's not just about what's
in our families' best interests,

37:28.546 --> 37:30.673
it's what's in our nation's.

37:30.815 --> 37:31.782
Thank you.

37:42.393 --> 37:44.258
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:44.395 --> 37:47.592
Congressman,
Mr. James Stanworth.

37:47.732 --> 37:50.826
You sure have a way with words.
It's mighty impressive.

37:52.169 --> 37:53.101
Thank you.

37:53.237 --> 37:56.035
- May I help you?
- My name's Derek Morgan.

37:56.173 --> 37:57.731
We're with the FBI.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.675
Do your friends here know
that you're a closet psychopath?

38:04.115 --> 38:05.082
Excuse me?

38:05.216 --> 38:06.740
Don Sanderson does.

38:06.884 --> 38:08.579
Do you remember him?

38:08.719 --> 38:10.778
I'm sure you do.

38:10.921 --> 38:12.183
You murdered his entire family

38:12.323 --> 38:14.848
and got him put away for 25 years.

38:14.992 --> 38:17.290
Well, Agent,
if you've got anything on me...

38:17.428 --> 38:18.725
No.

38:20.498 --> 38:23.262
James, it's not on you,
it's inside of you.

38:23.401 --> 38:25.631
Killing Mary Rutka
really got you going, didn't it?

38:25.770 --> 38:28.102
I'm afraid I don't know who that is.

38:28.239 --> 38:30.434
- Jim, what's going on?
- They were just leaving.

38:30.574 --> 38:32.872
- But I don't understand...
- Don't worry.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.478
He's good at that, isn't he? Anger.

38:35.613 --> 38:38.582
He's dismissive by nature.
Can't show affection, though, can he?

38:38.716 --> 38:40.980
You walk on eggshells,
you and the children.

38:41.118 --> 38:42.483
- Jim...
- Shut up!

38:43.754 --> 38:45.813
Oh, here he comes.

38:45.956 --> 38:48.891
Where was your husband today
around 3:00?

38:49.026 --> 38:50.891
These are ridiculous fabrications.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.962
It doesn't matter.
We know where he was.

38:53.097 --> 38:55.998
I held the hand
of the woman he murdered.

38:56.133 --> 38:57.623
Right.

38:57.768 --> 39:02.262
James, whoever did kill Mary
left some DNA behind

39:02.406 --> 39:04.306
under her fingernails.

39:09.647 --> 39:11.512
- What's that?
- Well, that would be a cut.

39:11.649 --> 39:13.139
I cut myself on a broken glass.

39:13.284 --> 39:16.014
No. Mary Rutka did that to you
trying to defend herself.

39:16.153 --> 39:19.611
You knew that Don Sanderson
was out after 25 years.

39:19.757 --> 39:21.418
He got to Tom Wittman,

39:21.559 --> 39:22.890
and you were afraid
that if he got to Mary,

39:23.027 --> 39:24.255
he might find you and bring you down

39:24.395 --> 39:26.386
for what you did to his family
all those years ago.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.521
- You're delusional, Agent.
- You panicked, and you killed Mary.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.429
- I don't panic.
- You did panic.

39:30.568 --> 39:31.796
You're a killer. It's what you do.

39:31.936 --> 39:32.925
You destroy people's lives.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.799
I destroyed no one.

39:34.939 --> 39:37.169
You put a man away for life,
you murdered his family,

39:37.308 --> 39:39.435
and today you killed a woman
who would never betray you...

39:39.577 --> 39:41.408
- I killed no one.
...because you panicked.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.172
You are a killer.
You are a psychopath.

39:43.314 --> 39:44.645
You panicked, and...

39:44.782 --> 39:48.081
I don't panic! I don't panic!

39:52.323 --> 39:53.381
There he is.

39:53.524 --> 39:55.355
Jim, what's going on?

39:55.493 --> 39:56.619
Shh!

39:56.761 --> 39:58.456
Call Charles.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.128
Don't say another word.

40:02.266 --> 40:03.392
They've got nothing.

40:03.534 --> 40:05.525
We found the tape.

40:09.473 --> 40:13.068
James Stanworth, you're under arrest
for the murder of Mary Rutka.

40:13.210 --> 40:14.142
This is absurd.

40:14.278 --> 40:15.836
You have the right to remain silent.

40:15.980 --> 40:19.381
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

40:19.517 --> 40:21.576
You have the right
to speak to an attorney.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.243
If you cannot afford an attorney...

40:40.337 --> 40:43.534
There hasn't been a second
where I haven't thought about this.

40:43.674 --> 40:45.164
Now it's here.

40:47.011 --> 40:49.138
How does it feel?

40:49.280 --> 40:51.180
I'm terrified.

40:54.151 --> 40:56.483
You know, your son has
been studying medicine.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.490
He wants to open his own clinic.

41:01.525 --> 41:03.755
It seems to me he's becoming
a lot like his father.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.897
I don't even know what he looks like.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.199
Well, it looks like
you're about to find out.

41:14.338 --> 41:16.966
Yes, but I...

41:17.107 --> 41:19.507
What am I supposed to say to him?

41:19.643 --> 41:22.703
He knows that you didn't do it.

41:22.847 --> 41:25.873
That's all you ever wanted him to know.

41:26.016 --> 41:27.347
Yeah.

41:35.626 --> 41:37.184
Go.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.023
Show him who his dad really is.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.464
Oh, my God.

41:52.476 --> 41:53.841
Joshua.

42:02.653 --> 42:04.518
<i>All truths are easy to understand</i>

42:04.655 --> 42:06.179

42:06.323 --> 42:08.883
<i>The point is to discover them.</i>

42:09.026 --> 42:10.516
