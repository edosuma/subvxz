00:50.110 --> 00:54.050
(birds cawing and chirping)

01:02.200 --> 01:05.110
(tense music)

01:35.160 --> 01:38.040
(Tom sighing)

02:22.080 --> 02:24.220
(rain pattering)

02:33.100 --> 02:35.180
(tense music)

02:56.140 --> 02:57.100
- Mira.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.090
Mira, you here?

03:05.170 --> 03:06.140
Mira!

03:08.070 --> 03:08.230
Mira!

03:13.160 --> 03:14.220
Hey, where you at, girl?

03:30.160 --> 03:31.150
Hey, Mira!

03:33.020 --> 03:34.110
Come on, it's not funny.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.140
Hey.

03:57.150 --> 03:58.120
Hey, 'scuse me.

03:58.130 --> 04:00.120
Have you seen a little girl?

04:00.130 --> 04:02.120
Hey, excuse me.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.170
- Run!

04:04.180 --> 04:07.180
(suspenseful music)

04:09.030 --> 04:12.000
(woman screaming)

04:16.130 --> 04:19.130
(Tom grunts)

04:19.140 --> 04:22.089
(woman groaning)

04:27.140 --> 04:30.010
(men grunting)

04:34.210 --> 04:36.090
- Daddy!

04:36.100 --> 04:37.010
- Mira?

04:37.020 --> 04:37.230
Mira!

04:44.090 --> 04:45.190
- Daddy!

04:45.200 --> 04:46.200
- Mira, run!

04:47.170 --> 04:48.130
Run!

04:48.130 --> 04:49.160
I'll come for you!

04:49.170 --> 04:50.130
- Daddy!

04:50.130 --> 04:51.130
- Run!

04:51.130 --> 04:52.100
Run!

05:04.000 --> 05:06.200
(woman shouting)

05:52.200 --> 05:55.150
(motor humming)

06:13.210 --> 06:15.180
- Oh, I like that one.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.140
- Oh, that one is
a courage badge.

06:18.150 --> 06:20.190
We had to let other
girls lead us blindfolded

06:20.200 --> 06:22.230
through this obstacle
course, we had to climb

06:23.000 --> 06:26.100
through tunnels, jump
over hurdles, very scary.

06:27.150 --> 06:30.230
But now we just
need my cookie CEO

06:30.230 --> 06:32.020
and my naturalist
to make brownie.

06:32.030 --> 06:33.210
- Oh, naturalist.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.200
What's that?

06:34.210 --> 06:36.160
- We have to pick flowers.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.180
- Come on, that's not
a real thing, is it?

06:39.220 --> 06:42.030
- Tom.
- Are we paying for this?

06:42.040 --> 06:43.000
What?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.220
- Yes, they're real.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.120
- Well, I don't know
what you're doing,

06:46.120 --> 06:49.010
but when I was in
scouts, I did real stuff,

06:49.020 --> 06:51.040
like you know, build
fires, morse code,

06:51.050 --> 06:54.120
not this puppy
cuddling or whatever.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.010
- Girl Scouts don't do
all that stupid stuff.

06:58.020 --> 07:00.180
- Listen, that is not stupid,
sport, it's the real stuff.

07:00.190 --> 07:04.060
- You know, picking flowers,
that seems kinda stupid, right?

07:04.070 --> 07:05.230
- Tom, cut it out!

07:06.000 --> 07:07.040
- What?

07:07.050 --> 07:08.130
- It is stupid and
nobody cares about

07:08.140 --> 07:10.030
those kinds of badges anymore.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.160
- No, they don't?

07:11.160 --> 07:13.050
All right, so a bear
comes at you in the woods,

07:13.060 --> 07:14.120
what you gonna do?

07:14.130 --> 07:15.130
You gonna bake it a cake?

07:15.140 --> 07:17.020
- That's not gonna happen
'cause I'm not gonna

07:17.040 --> 07:18.170
go into the woods.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.060
- Yeah, well, I hate to
break it to you, sport,

07:20.070 --> 07:23.020
but if you don't go in the
woods, you are not a scout.

07:23.030 --> 07:25.050
- I am a scout, and
you don't know shit!

07:25.050 --> 07:26.070
- Hey!

07:26.080 --> 07:27.190
Hey, Mira, come back here,
don't use that language!

07:27.200 --> 07:28.210
- Hey, hey.
- You believe that?

07:28.210 --> 07:30.020
- No, what the hell?

07:30.030 --> 07:31.020
- Me?

07:31.030 --> 07:32.020
- Yes, you!

07:32.030 --> 07:33.050
- I'm just trying to help her.

07:33.050 --> 07:34.070
- [Naomi] You're not.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.020
- Oh, don't be
like that, come on.

07:38.170 --> 07:39.170
Oh, come on.

07:55.060 --> 07:56.060
She asleep?

08:02.180 --> 08:04.130
I'm sorry about
before, I just...

08:07.010 --> 08:09.140
I didn't mean to upset her,
it's just anything I say seems,

08:10.070 --> 08:11.170
just hates it.

08:11.180 --> 08:13.180
- She's just going
through some changes.

08:15.010 --> 08:16.050
She's sensitive.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.070
- So I need to walk
on eggshells now?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.170
- No.

08:19.180 --> 08:21.170
You just need to spend
more time with her.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.070
- Fine, I'll take her
to the movies on Friday.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.140
Easy.
- No, Tom, real time.

08:29.220 --> 08:32.039
How about you take her
camping this weekend?

08:34.039 --> 08:35.159
- This weekend?

08:35.169 --> 08:37.140
This weekend's not great.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.190
- What?
- You know, busy.

08:43.230 --> 08:46.080
All right, so Dan might
have like a poker night

08:46.090 --> 08:48.070
that I promised I'd go to.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.080
- (laughs) No, no, screw Dan.

08:50.090 --> 08:52.040
He can survive one
night without you.

08:52.050 --> 08:53.230
You need to spend time
with your daughter.

08:53.230 --> 08:56.040
- I know, I know that, but
I need time for me too,

08:56.050 --> 08:58.030
and this week has
been ridiculous.

08:58.030 --> 09:00.160
- Tom, I'm serious.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.010
If you don't make
time we her now,

09:02.020 --> 09:04.070
she's not gonna make time
for you in the future.

09:04.070 --> 09:06.210
- Come on, don't say
that, it's not fair.

09:06.220 --> 09:08.020
You can't say that.

09:08.030 --> 09:10.020
I am killing myself
for this girl.

09:10.030 --> 09:11.170
For you, for all of us.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.030
We have enough money so
she can get these stupid--

09:13.040 --> 09:15.190
- Are you listening
to yourself right now?

09:15.190 --> 09:17.030
I mean, come on.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.080
You need to do this.

09:21.190 --> 09:24.030
(Tom scoffs)

09:25.220 --> 09:27.030
- You're not gonna
let this go, huh?

09:27.040 --> 09:28.040
- No.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.090
- All right, fine.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.080
Fine, I'll do it.

09:37.090 --> 09:38.180
I'll do it.
- Good.

09:38.190 --> 09:40.100
- Aren't you happy now?
- Yes.

09:40.110 --> 09:43.180
(Naomi laughs)

09:43.190 --> 09:45.040
- Thanks for the guilt trip.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.210
- Guilt trip, really?

09:46.220 --> 09:47.190
Okay.

09:55.190 --> 09:58.060
(gentle music)

10:08.010 --> 10:09.020
- [Tom] Mira!

10:09.030 --> 10:11.170
(Tom murmuring)

10:11.170 --> 10:12.090
Come on!

10:12.100 --> 10:13.080
(knocking on door)

10:13.090 --> 10:14.090
Let's do it!

10:22.190 --> 10:25.090
- [Man On Radio] Have reported
a rash of violent attacks

10:25.100 --> 10:28.170
across the county to
police and/or officials.

10:28.180 --> 10:30.030
We're working to the
establish the cause

10:30.040 --> 10:32.170
of these unprecedented
outbursts.

10:32.180 --> 10:33.100
The CDC...

10:36.040 --> 10:41.010
- Hey, what say we
just put the technology

10:43.170 --> 10:45.000
away this weekend, huh?

10:45.010 --> 10:45.220
No screens.

10:45.220 --> 10:47.010
What do you say, sport?

10:47.020 --> 10:47.220
Just you and me.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.020
Mira.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.050
Mira.

10:53.060 --> 10:54.030
Hey, hey, give me that.

10:55.220 --> 10:58.050
I say put it away, you
put it away, all right?

10:58.060 --> 10:59.120
Don't pretend I'm
not talking to ya.

10:59.130 --> 11:00.100
You hear me?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.220
All right now,
there you go, sport.

11:07.220 --> 11:10.000
Well, we are almost set up.

11:10.010 --> 11:11.010
Thanks for the help.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.100
So, tell me what you
wanna do today, huh?

11:14.110 --> 11:17.100
You wanna go for a hike?

11:22.220 --> 11:24.000
What's that?

11:24.010 --> 11:25.180
Is that a yes or a no?

11:25.180 --> 11:27.120
- No, not really.

11:27.130 --> 11:29.070
- Not really. (chuckles)

11:29.080 --> 11:30.080
Why not?

11:31.110 --> 11:33.070
- Because I don't like it.

11:33.070 --> 11:37.090
- How do you know you don't
like it until you try it?

11:37.100 --> 11:38.120
Fine, okay, all right.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.100
How about fishing?

11:41.110 --> 11:43.100
I know you like that.

11:43.110 --> 11:46.220
- (scoffs) Not anymore.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.050
- (clears throat) All right.

11:49.060 --> 11:51.200
Well, that's great.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.050
So tell me then,
what do you like?

11:55.140 --> 12:00.070
- Well, I like computer games
and Amazing World of Gumball.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.050
- Amazing World of what?

12:02.060 --> 12:06.030
- Gumball.

12:06.030 --> 12:09.120
- Okay, no gumballs out
here, so, (chuckles).

12:11.040 --> 12:12.140
How about we go for
a hike, then, huh?

12:12.150 --> 12:13.120
Good stuff.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.010
(Tom sighs)

12:17.020 --> 12:20.020
(people chattering)

12:22.120 --> 12:25.030
Okay, see some cool
stuff today, sweetheart.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.070
Hey.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.120
Hey come on, enough
of the phone already.

12:28.130 --> 12:29.130
Put it away.

12:31.070 --> 12:32.040
I'm serious.

12:34.070 --> 12:35.110
(Tom sighs)

12:35.120 --> 12:36.210
Put it inside and
leave it there, okay?

12:36.220 --> 12:38.130
I don't wanna have
to tell you again.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.100
Go on.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.210
(Mira sighs)

12:52.220 --> 12:53.210
- Please stop.

12:53.220 --> 12:55.050
- Come on, lazy bones.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.010
- I wanna stop.

12:57.020 --> 12:58.150
- All right, you see
up here, you got,

12:58.160 --> 13:00.070
what are you doing, come
on, I said let's go,

13:00.080 --> 13:01.080
sport, come on.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.070
All right, what's wrong?

13:08.080 --> 13:09.110
- Tired.

13:09.120 --> 13:13.050
- Uh-uh, we've been barely
going an hour, you're not tired.

13:13.050 --> 13:14.080
- Yes I am.

13:14.090 --> 13:16.060
- Trying to teach you how
to be a scout here, kiddo.

13:16.070 --> 13:17.040
- I am a scout!

13:18.210 --> 13:20.010
Just want Mommy.

13:22.100 --> 13:25.130
- Right, well, your
mother's not here, so.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.110
- (sighs) I just wanna go home.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.010
- [Tom] Look, we
just got here, so--

13:32.010 --> 13:33.070
- I don't care, I wanna go home.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.150
- [Tom] We came all
this way to spend

13:34.160 --> 13:36.040
a little time together, and--

13:36.050 --> 13:37.140
- I don't wanna spend
any stupid time together.

13:37.140 --> 13:38.140
- Why not?

13:39.100 --> 13:40.220
- Because I don't like you.

13:40.230 --> 13:43.060
- Hey hey, hey hey,
that is not nice, miss,

13:43.070 --> 13:44.120
not a nice thing to say.

13:44.130 --> 13:46.150
- I don't care,
just take me home.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.140
- Mira, come on,
don't be like that.

13:48.150 --> 13:51.140
- Just take me home and
you can go to Dan's.

13:51.150 --> 13:53.100
- Dan's, what are
you talking about?

13:53.100 --> 13:55.220
- (sighs) You wanna go to Dan's.

13:55.230 --> 13:57.060
Mommy made you come here.

14:00.110 --> 14:03.040
- Hey, no, no, that is not true.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.000
Not true, I wanted
to come, I did.

14:06.010 --> 14:07.020
- You're a liar.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.020
You're lying.

14:08.030 --> 14:09.160
You always said no lying.

14:09.170 --> 14:10.230
- I am not lying.

14:12.110 --> 14:13.140
- (sighs) Last summer
at the drive-in movie,

14:13.150 --> 14:15.150
that guy lied about
stealing our spot.

14:15.150 --> 14:19.050
Then you said to Mommy that
liars are the lowest of the low.

14:19.060 --> 14:22.070
- I'm not talking about,
hey, stop, kiddo, stop.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.030
Stop, sport, sport.
- What?

14:25.030 --> 14:27.100
(Tom sighs)

14:29.010 --> 14:30.140
- All right, look, how about...

14:36.110 --> 14:41.020
Let's go back, and we'll get
some food and sleep on it,

14:42.120 --> 14:46.120
and tell you what, in the
morning, if you still hate it,

14:46.130 --> 14:50.030
all this, then
I'll take you home.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.010
Deal?

14:57.110 --> 14:58.080
- Fine.

14:59.170 --> 15:02.090
(solemn music)

15:27.150 --> 15:30.000
- Think bears live in those?

15:30.010 --> 15:31.040
- Could be, in the winter.

15:32.130 --> 15:34.110
- Can we go up and see?

15:35.080 --> 15:36.040
- Sure.

15:38.090 --> 15:40.020
It's a little steep here, but...

15:42.110 --> 15:44.040
There might be a
path further up.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.030
Come on.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.010
- Dad.
- Mm-hmm?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.010
- [Mira] Look.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.060
- Bring it over here.

15:55.070 --> 15:56.090
What you got?

16:02.050 --> 16:03.020
Huh.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.070
You know what this is?

16:06.080 --> 16:09.020
I think this is an
old Chinook arrowhead.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.110
- Really?

16:10.120 --> 16:13.040
They really used
smoke signals to talk?

16:13.050 --> 16:14.010
- They did, yeah.

16:14.010 --> 16:15.110
You know, actually,
when I was a scout,

16:15.120 --> 16:17.010
they taught me how to do it all.

16:17.020 --> 16:18.090
I could show ya if you want.

16:19.130 --> 16:20.100
- Maybe later.

16:22.100 --> 16:27.020
So, you really think that this
is a real Chinook arrowhead?

16:27.030 --> 16:27.200
- This one?

16:27.210 --> 16:29.060
Yeah, I think it might be.

16:29.060 --> 16:32.050
I think you got one
there, sweetheart.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.170
Oh, you dig one hole here, and
another one beside it, here.

16:45.060 --> 16:48.080
And then make a little tunnel
between, see, like that, see?

16:48.090 --> 16:49.160
So a fire goes in the first one,

16:49.170 --> 16:52.100
and the other one acts
as a bit of a chimney,

16:52.110 --> 16:55.050
so if it rains, you can have
one and still keep warm.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.060
Wanna try digging a hole?
- Okay.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.030
- Over here.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.050
Yep.
- Like this?

17:01.060 --> 17:02.100
- Yep, you're right.

17:02.110 --> 17:05.180
Just get that out of
the way, keep going.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.089
You're getting it.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.040
- Dad?
- Mm-hmm.

17:17.140 --> 17:18.150
- I'm sorry.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.109
- Sorry, for what?

17:25.079 --> 17:26.140
- That you didn't get a boy.

17:32.140 --> 17:34.050
I know you really wanted one.

17:40.050 --> 17:42.210
I can try to be more like
a boy if you want me to.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.190
- Why would you say that?

17:48.120 --> 17:50.080
- So you'd spend
more time with me.

17:52.210 --> 17:53.190
- You guys hungry?

17:55.140 --> 17:56.110
We made extra.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.160
- Sure.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.080
You wanna go?

18:05.080 --> 18:06.110
- Sure.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.110
- [Mira] Thanks.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.040
Yep, sure, we'll be right over.

18:11.070 --> 18:14.050
(guitar strumming)

18:32.160 --> 18:35.130
(people murmuring)

18:57.200 --> 18:59.060
What you got there, sport?

19:00.090 --> 19:02.050
- [Mira] It's a bunch
of baby turtles.

19:02.060 --> 19:03.120
- Yeah?

19:03.130 --> 19:04.100
That's probably a nest.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.060
You wanna let that alone.

19:06.070 --> 19:06.230
- [Mira] I am.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.060
Where's the mommy turtle?

19:10.070 --> 19:11.180
- Probably out getting
dinner or something.

19:11.190 --> 19:13.080
Come on, I wanna
show you something.

19:14.140 --> 19:15.160
Come on, sport.

19:15.170 --> 19:16.140
Hustle!

19:20.200 --> 19:21.230
Come on, scoot.

19:23.110 --> 19:24.100
Here you go.

19:25.090 --> 19:26.070
Let's see.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.160
Hey, you know what that is?

19:27.170 --> 19:29.060
- Mm-mm.

19:29.070 --> 19:30.190
- That is another language,
it's called morse code.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.060
You know that, you
can communicate

19:32.070 --> 19:33.160
with pretty much
anyone in the world.

19:33.170 --> 19:36.080
See, it's kinda like the
smoke signals that we did,

19:36.090 --> 19:37.220
except everybody knows it.

19:37.230 --> 19:39.100
- (sighs) Dad.
- What?

19:39.110 --> 19:42.200
- Smoking again,
I can smell you.

19:42.210 --> 19:44.160
- I only had a half, just, hey,

19:44.170 --> 19:45.180
don't tell your mother, okay?

19:45.190 --> 19:47.170
- Oh, like that's not so bad.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.190
Mom says that every time
you smoke a cigarette,

19:50.200 --> 19:52.170
you lose six minutes
of your life.

19:52.180 --> 19:54.150
You just had half a cigarette,
which means that you lost

19:54.160 --> 19:55.230
three minutes of your life.

19:57.010 --> 19:58.070
- Okay, well.

19:59.180 --> 20:00.190
Okay, you win.

20:02.150 --> 20:03.180
Can't have that, can we?

20:08.150 --> 20:12.100
Hey, how about you
try to see, huh?

20:12.110 --> 20:13.070
- Okay.

20:19.220 --> 20:20.230
Hey Dad.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
- Yeah, sport?

20:23.160 --> 20:26.070
- You think those baby turtles
will be okay in the rain?

20:27.110 --> 20:29.000
- They'll be fine,
they like the rain.

20:32.010 --> 20:33.010
- Dad?

20:54.090 --> 20:57.180
(thunder rumbling)

20:57.190 --> 20:58.210
I think I like Josh.

21:02.110 --> 21:04.220
- The boy you were
playing with before?

21:06.000 --> 21:06.210
- Mm-hmm.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
But, I mean, I don't
think he likes me.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.210
- Oh.

21:17.230 --> 21:20.150
(Tom chuckles)

21:25.100 --> 21:26.200
You know what?

21:26.210 --> 21:29.170
If he doesn't, he's not
good enough for you.

21:33.170 --> 21:34.170
- Okay.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.190
So, are you sure
about the turtles?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.010
- [Tom] Yes, I'm sure
about the turtles.

21:40.010 --> 21:41.130
They like water.

21:41.130 --> 21:43.180
- No, like, are you really sure.

21:43.190 --> 21:45.010
- (chuckles) Yeah.

21:45.010 --> 21:47.210
(rain pattering)

21:49.110 --> 21:52.080
(thunder crashes)

22:40.010 --> 22:42.150
(Tom sighing)

22:47.190 --> 22:48.150
Jesus.

22:55.010 --> 22:55.220
Oh, shit.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.110
(Tom sighs)

23:46.050 --> 23:49.120
(zombies growling)

23:49.120 --> 23:50.040
Mira!

23:53.130 --> 23:55.010
Mira!

23:55.020 --> 23:56.220
(Tom grunting)

23:56.230 --> 24:00.000
(suspenseful music)

24:20.170 --> 24:23.050
(Tom shouting)

24:26.050 --> 24:28.180
(gun clicks)

25:02.180 --> 25:07.180
(gunshots banging)
(dramatic music)

25:23.160 --> 25:26.000
(gun clicks)

25:53.010 --> 25:55.230
(zombie screaming)

26:17.100 --> 26:20.020
(Tom groaning)

28:10.200 --> 28:11.120
Fuck you!

28:13.100 --> 28:16.070
(engine stalling)

28:23.210 --> 28:25.020
Oh, Jesus.

28:25.030 --> 28:28.000
(screeching music)

28:29.200 --> 28:32.120
(engine stalling)

28:51.140 --> 28:54.080
(gunshot bangs)

29:11.000 --> 29:13.100
(Tom panting)

29:22.040 --> 29:24.190
(Tom groaning)

29:46.020 --> 29:48.200
(phone ringing)

29:53.110 --> 29:54.080
No.

29:55.140 --> 29:58.080
(phone ringing)

30:34.050 --> 30:35.100
(Tom shouts)

30:35.110 --> 30:38.020
(phone ringing)

30:39.090 --> 30:41.040
(insects chirping)

30:41.050 --> 30:42.120
- Hey, you know all
those stars up there

30:42.130 --> 30:43.220
have different names?

30:47.130 --> 30:49.080
You know that?

30:49.090 --> 30:52.020
- Yeah.
- You do?

30:52.020 --> 30:53.120
Do you see that one up there?

30:53.130 --> 30:55.070
Brightest one in the
sky, you see that?

30:55.070 --> 30:56.080
- [Mira] Yeah.

30:56.090 --> 30:58.000
- That one's Polaris.

30:58.010 --> 30:59.010
He's the north star.

31:00.100 --> 31:02.110
If you find him, always
gonna know where north is.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.230
Hey, see the ones
opposite the mountains,

31:10.000 --> 31:11.150
that little cluster here?
I think that's the

31:11.150 --> 31:14.020
Mira constellation,
if I'm not mistaken.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.030
- Really?

31:16.030 --> 31:18.030
- Yeah, named after
a little girl.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.050
- That one is the Big Dipper.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.020
- Oh is it, is that
what it's called?

31:23.030 --> 31:24.110
- Yeah.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.160
- Oh, I apologize.

31:27.110 --> 31:28.150
How about up here?

31:28.150 --> 31:30.130
That's Cassiopeia, she's
always in the west,

31:30.140 --> 31:32.070
so if she's in the
west, he's in the north,

31:32.080 --> 31:34.120
hey, tell me which way is home?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.010
- I don't know.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.060
- Go between those
two, northwest?

31:40.070 --> 31:42.140
You really wanna get home,
you head over that way.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.030
Can you tell me which way it
is to Grandpa Jack's house?

31:46.040 --> 31:47.050
- No.

31:47.060 --> 31:49.000
Grandpa Jack's mean.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.120
- Yeah, okay.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.170
He's hard, sure.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.000
I guess he always has been.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.050
He still loves you, though.

32:09.140 --> 32:13.080
He sometimes has a tough
time in showing it.

32:20.070 --> 32:22.100
Hey, wanna do a few more names?

32:25.100 --> 32:28.170
(zombies screaming)
(tense music)

32:28.180 --> 32:31.100
(Tom shouting)

32:42.080 --> 32:46.050
(zombies grunting and banging)

33:00.050 --> 33:02.140
(Tom shouts)

33:32.020 --> 33:33.150
It's about 40 miles.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.020
50, 50 miles.

33:39.030 --> 33:40.100
50 miles.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.070
Okay.

33:44.200 --> 33:47.150

33:47.150 --> 33:52.150
(radio static buzzing)
(man mumbling on radio)

33:53.060 --> 33:54.150
- [Man On Radio] Police
and National Guard

33:54.160 --> 33:56.070
are closing borders.

33:57.100 --> 34:02.050

Wait, wait.

Scared.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.120

44:53.020 --> 44:55.230
(zombie shouting)

45:55.210 --> 46:00.210
(Tom coughing)
(zombies growling)

46:55.040 --> 46:57.150
(solemn music)

47:52.070 --> 47:54.230
(Tom coughing)

49:54.210 --> 49:57.180
(Tom sniffs)

49:57.190 --> 50:00.150
(rain pattering)

51:17.070 --> 51:20.050
(zombies growling)

51:48.160 --> 51:51.160
(suspenseful music)

51:59.060 --> 51:59.210
Hey.

51:59.220 --> 52:00.230
Hey!

52:01.000 --> 52:01.210
Hey!

52:14.160 --> 52:17.130
(vehicle crashing)

52:19.060 --> 52:20.110
Hey, no no no!

52:20.120 --> 52:22.050
No, over here, come here!

52:22.060 --> 52:22.220
Hey!

52:26.220 --> 52:29.180
(dramatic music)

52:36.140 --> 52:39.100
(glass shattering)

53:31.110 --> 53:34.110
- I left early for my
patrol up the mountain,

53:35.180 --> 53:40.070
and by the time I got
back, everyone had changed.

53:43.150 --> 53:46.070
I was just alone.

53:48.110 --> 53:49.080
On my own.

53:51.110 --> 53:54.120
So I started driving,
and I found you.

53:55.190 --> 53:59.090
- Driving, you came
past, did you see a girl?

53:59.100 --> 54:00.070
A little girl?

54:01.090 --> 54:04.120
She's about, you
know, I got a photo.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.000
- I don't know, man,
I passed a few people,

54:08.000 --> 54:09.130
but I just wanted
to get out of there.

54:09.140 --> 54:10.210
- Did you see her?

54:11.220 --> 54:13.000
Did you see her?

54:14.220 --> 54:15.190
Her.

54:20.190 --> 54:22.080
- Very possible, I mean--

54:22.090 --> 54:23.110
- Are you sure?

54:23.120 --> 54:24.220
Are you sure?

54:24.230 --> 54:26.070
- It's a definite maybe.

54:28.140 --> 54:30.150
- Was she wearing a jacket?

54:30.160 --> 54:32.000
Was she wearing a jacket?

54:32.010 --> 54:33.230
Was she wearing a jacket?

54:34.000 --> 54:36.120
You see this out
here, you see that?

54:36.130 --> 54:38.010
Was she, that jacket,
was she wearing that?

54:38.010 --> 54:41.010
- No, I don't think
so, sorry mate.

54:42.140 --> 54:45.090
- No, that's great,
that's great.

54:45.100 --> 54:46.210
She could be alive.

54:50.010 --> 54:51.130
Here, where'd she get?

54:51.130 --> 54:52.230
How far from here?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.230
- Okay, I'd say right about
there, towards the mountain.

54:58.030 --> 55:00.130
- How did she get that far?

55:01.200 --> 55:02.220
Was she with somebody?

55:07.230 --> 55:08.200
- No, no.

55:13.100 --> 55:14.200
- We need to go get her.

55:14.210 --> 55:17.230
- Yeah, of course, of course,
we will, she's your daughter.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.200
But we'll need a plan.

55:21.120 --> 55:24.010
Have you got any guns?

55:26.190 --> 55:27.170
A hunting rifle?

55:27.180 --> 55:29.140
- No, I tell you what, I got...

55:31.210 --> 55:32.200
I got this.

55:34.180 --> 55:36.180
It's just got one bullet.

55:38.050 --> 55:41.020
- Yeah, that's not good.

55:42.100 --> 55:44.090
Okay, what about
food, how much we got?

55:46.000 --> 55:47.220
- A couple of days, tops.

55:49.170 --> 55:50.220
- All right, well
first off, we need

55:50.220 --> 55:51.230
to get your truck started.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.110
- Won't work, tried
it, it's dead.

55:54.120 --> 55:55.100
(man laughs)

55:55.100 --> 55:56.020
- Shit.

55:57.040 --> 55:59.160
Well, that just sucks.

56:00.220 --> 56:02.110
Because we're gonna
need to find a way

56:02.120 --> 56:06.190
to get past these people.

56:08.150 --> 56:10.110
- We'll find a way
out, let's do it.

56:10.110 --> 56:11.210
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, easy, easy.

56:11.220 --> 56:13.030
- You and me, come on!

56:13.040 --> 56:14.030
- Get serious, okay?

56:14.030 --> 56:16.130
That's not a good plan.

56:16.140 --> 56:17.140
No...

56:18.160 --> 56:23.110
We are gonna be no good to
her if we're dead, okay?

56:23.120 --> 56:24.210
Okay, okay, okay.

56:24.220 --> 56:28.190
We need to eat first, build
up our strength, okay?

56:28.190 --> 56:31.220
Build up our strength, and
then we'll come up with a plan.

56:31.230 --> 56:33.100
Come up with a plan.

56:35.220 --> 56:37.040
Radio station is dead.

56:39.010 --> 56:42.040
On the TV set there,
the cities are a mess.

56:43.150 --> 56:44.230
And then it all just stopped.

56:46.010 --> 56:47.120
And now it's all just wee!

56:49.050 --> 56:52.030
(zombies growling)

56:58.140 --> 57:00.130
- Do you have a family?

57:01.200 --> 57:03.150
- I had a girlfriend.

57:06.020 --> 57:08.020
(man mumbling)

57:08.030 --> 57:10.040
- Get back to talking
about this plan.

57:10.040 --> 57:11.170
I wanna get back to my daughter.

57:11.180 --> 57:12.190
- Yeah.

57:12.200 --> 57:13.220
Absolutely.

57:13.230 --> 57:14.200
But...

57:17.200 --> 57:18.230
(mumbling) food stuff.

57:21.140 --> 57:23.020
Especially for when we find her.

57:24.080 --> 57:26.170
You know, we could be
out there a long time.

57:29.190 --> 57:32.070
You know, I know of
this supply cabin,

57:32.080 --> 57:35.020
but it's not close.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.190
- I mean, I got a bunch of food.

57:37.200 --> 57:39.230
It's just up in that
tree over there.

57:40.000 --> 57:40.210
I can't get to it.

57:44.190 --> 57:45.160
- Okay.

57:47.050 --> 57:48.030
Let's go look.

57:50.070 --> 57:52.170
Well, we're kinda faced
with the same problem, huh?

57:53.170 --> 57:56.010
You got any way to hook it?

57:56.010 --> 57:57.050
- I already tried that.

57:58.220 --> 58:00.180
- Well, maybe I
could just toss you.

58:03.070 --> 58:07.010
You know, tie a rope
around you and I toss you.

58:09.070 --> 58:12.180
- Yeah, no offense, but
you don't look that strong.

58:18.180 --> 58:20.150
- I might surprise you.

58:24.010 --> 58:25.000
Look, it's just a thought.

58:25.010 --> 58:26.020
We'll figure it out.

58:26.030 --> 58:27.190
- Hey, hey, hey, where do
you think you're going?

58:27.200 --> 58:28.220
My daughter, what
about the plan?

58:28.230 --> 58:30.030
You said you were gonna help.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.230
- Okay, okay, all
right, all right.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.040
But you know what, we gotta
be smart about it, okay?

58:35.050 --> 58:37.150
Otherwise nobody's
gonna find her.

58:37.160 --> 58:40.000
The sun's setting, it's
gonna get dark soon,

58:40.010 --> 58:41.140
and it's too risky at night.

58:41.140 --> 58:43.220
So let's set off in the
morning, we'll go find her.

58:43.230 --> 58:44.190
- Bullshit.

58:44.190 --> 58:45.230
Hey.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.080
My daughter is 10 years old and
she is out there on her own.

58:48.090 --> 58:51.150
She needs help and you said
that you were gonna help me.

58:51.160 --> 58:54.040
- Get your hands off me.

58:54.050 --> 58:57.030
- Listen pal, I saved your
goddamn life, you owe me.

58:57.030 --> 59:00.010
- I don't owe you shit, okay?!

59:00.020 --> 59:01.030
So back off!

59:02.020 --> 59:04.160
(man panting)

59:07.150 --> 59:10.040
(man laughing)

59:10.050 --> 59:11.050
I'm sorry.

59:13.190 --> 59:14.190
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

59:16.050 --> 59:19.030
Just gotta raging headache
and I'm super stressed.

59:22.030 --> 59:25.090
This is the worst day in
our lives for both of us.

59:29.170 --> 59:32.180
We'll set out first thing
in the morning, okay?

59:32.190 --> 59:34.050
I promise you.

59:40.030 --> 59:43.010
(zombies growling)

59:45.020 --> 59:48.000
(insects chirping)

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.180
(tense music)

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:47.170
(gun clicking)

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.080
(suspenseful music)

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:42.020
(man shouting)

01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:05.200
(man screaming)

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:13.080
(both grunting)

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:26.070
(zombies growling)
(man panting)

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:33.100
(man coughing)

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:02.110
(both grunting)

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:11.090
(handcuffs clicking)

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.020
(man shouting)

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.020
(feedback ringing)

01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:31.110
(solemn music)

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.100
(zombies growling)

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.060
(men grunting)

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:55.060
- [Man] No!

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:57.220
(man panting)

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:02.030
(man shouting)

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.020
(zombies growling)

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:17.030
(flesh tearing)

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:44.110
(solemn music)

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.110
(insects chirping)

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:15.040
(Tom gasps)

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:18.040
(thunder rumbling)

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:22.040
(Tom panting)

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.150
Mira.

01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:31.140
Mira?

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.050
Oh baby.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:38.000
(Tom whispering)

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.180
No, not you.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.170
Not you.

01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:44.130
(both shouting)

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.010
(glass shatters)

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:51.020
(rain pattering)
(wind whistling)

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.020
(thunder rumbling)

01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:58.030
(zombies screaming)

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:04.050
(dramatic music)

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.140
(thunder rumbling)

01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:43.020
(zombies screaming and growling)

01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:48.060
(explosion booming)

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.190
- Turtles in space, right?

01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:52.030
No, it's true, it's true.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.020
Two Russian turtles
went around the moon.

01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:55.110
- No they didn't.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.100
- Yes they did.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.050
I swear to god, they did.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.110
They came back just
fine. (chuckles)

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.120
- Hmm.

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:02.020
You think they got scared?

01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:03.180
- [Tom] The turtles?

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.200
I don't know if turtles
get scared like we do.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.160
- I wish I didn't get scared.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.080
- No, it's okay.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:15.030
It's all right to be scared.

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.080
I mean, grownups get scared.

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:21.090
You just have to, you
know, face it head-on

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:24.130
and do the best you can.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.070
Proud of you, sport.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.130
- You are?

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.170
- Yeah.

01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:35.060
- I'm proud of you too, Dad.

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:41.210
(thunder rumbling)

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.140

01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:41.060
- Yes!

01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:43.060
(tires squealing)

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:44.040
Go, go!

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:54.160
(glass shattering)

01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:57.130

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.120
Mira.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.040
- I missed you.

01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:04.200
- Missed you too.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
(suspenseful music)
