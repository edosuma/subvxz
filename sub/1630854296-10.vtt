15:06.000 --> 15:06.038
Need it stable to free Charlie.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.940
Lift an inch, crib an inch.
Hey, Charlie.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.776
(exhales)
It's like a rite of passage.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.000
Passage to what?
Retirement?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.646
Passage to what?
Retirement?

15:13.712 --> 15:15.814
(chuckles)
If you want it to be.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.983
But I thought you wanted
to be a firefighter.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.000
Hey, Bode, go help Freddy
with the chase cribbing.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.425
Hey, Bode, go help Freddy
with the chase cribbing.

15:26.492 --> 15:29.028
Hey. He's supposed to be out
in less than two hours.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.000
He's so close.

15:30.000 --> 15:30.229
He's so close.

15:30.296 --> 15:31.664
And the damn engine
falls on him.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.365
We're gonna get this off him.
For what?

15:33.432 --> 15:34.800
So he can leave here
less whole

15:34.867 --> 15:36.000
than when he got
locked up?
VINCE: No, Freddy.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.869
than when he got
locked up?
VINCE: No, Freddy.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.203
You got that wrong.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.072
Whatever condition
Charlie leaves here in,

15:40.139 --> 15:41.707
he's a hero.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.343
You hear that?

15:46.312 --> 15:48.000
We can do this faster,
for Charlie.

15:48.000 --> 15:48.947
We can do this faster,
for Charlie.

15:53.686 --> 15:54.000
SHARON:
Yes, an electrical burn.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.321
SHARON:
Yes, an electrical burn.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.589
MAN (over phone):
Okay, we are very
backed up today, ma'am.

15:57.656 --> 15:58.924
What's the patient's condition?

15:58.991 --> 16:00.000
Patient is conscious
and stable. Hurry!

16:00.000 --> 16:01.226
Patient is conscious
and stable. Hurry!

16:01.293 --> 16:04.396
I didn't know 911 could put you
on hold for seven minutes.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.000
The department is
completely overwhelmed

16:06.000 --> 16:06.999
The department is
completely overwhelmed

16:07.066 --> 16:09.568
with this power outage.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.000
Cara, I'm sorry,
this is gonna sting a bit.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.137
Cara, I'm sorry,
this is gonna sting a bit.

16:12.204 --> 16:13.639
(pained groan)

16:13.706 --> 16:15.841
Oh!

16:15.908 --> 16:17.176
Are you debriding?

16:17.242 --> 16:18.000
Yes.
Superficial?

16:18.000 --> 16:18.744
Yes.
Superficial?

16:18.811 --> 16:22.514
I would say superficial, yes,
with partial thickness.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.000
I see you've taken
an interest in first aid.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.317
I see you've taken
an interest in first aid.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.553
ER nursing, actually.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.000
Oh, you're following in
your mother's footsteps.

16:30.000 --> 16:30.389
Oh, you're following in
your mother's footsteps.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.391
That's fabulous, Cara.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.259
Good for you.
Thanks.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.627
I heard Bode's at Three Rock.

16:35.694 --> 16:36.000
Yep.
(clears throat)

16:36.000 --> 16:37.629
Yep.
(clears throat)

16:37.696 --> 16:41.133
It's not major leagues,
but it's a great program.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.000
Mm. It is, yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:42.735
Mm. It is, yeah.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.303
Edgewater's so
lucky to have it.

16:44.370 --> 16:47.239
When do you, um,
get into the ER?

16:47.306 --> 16:48.000
I take my boards
next week. (exhales)

16:48.000 --> 16:50.409
I take my boards
next week. (exhales)

16:50.476 --> 16:53.178
I, uh, put nursing on
hold when I thought

16:53.245 --> 16:54.000
my future was
with Bode.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.414
my future was
with Bode.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.350
Thought baseball was gonna
take us on the road.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.000
And when we broke up,
I was alone,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.253
And when we broke up,
I was alone,

17:01.320 --> 17:03.622
and I decided to
follow my heart,

17:03.689 --> 17:05.424
figured out
what I wanted.

17:05.491 --> 17:06.000
I'm excited.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.659
I'm excited.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.762
Are you okay?
Yeah.

17:09.828 --> 17:12.000
(clears throat) I'm just
hot with the A/C off.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.399
(clears throat) I'm just
hot with the A/C off.

17:13.465 --> 17:14.767
Well, you should rest.
(exhales sharply)

17:14.833 --> 17:16.468
You haven't even finished
your dialysis.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.000
You want to debride
your own electrical burn?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.004
You want to debride
your own electrical burn?

17:19.071 --> 17:20.606
(both laugh)

17:20.672 --> 17:22.775
Ooh, even I couldn't
do that.

17:22.841 --> 17:24.000
(sighs)

17:24.000 --> 17:24.343
(sighs)

17:24.410 --> 17:26.412
Get some rest, man.

17:26.478 --> 17:28.547
Paid medical leave.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.000
May be a blessing in disguise.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.216
May be a blessing in disguise.

17:31.283 --> 17:32.618
Thank you.

17:32.684 --> 17:35.120
PARAMEDIC: All right,
ready to lift?

17:35.187 --> 17:36.000
Let's go.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.789
Let's go.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.124
Yeah.

17:39.191 --> 17:41.427
(indistinct radio chatter)

17:44.263 --> 17:46.498
All right, let's go.
We're through.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.833
Here's the line.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.000
Let's keep the hose from kinking

17:48.000 --> 17:49.401
Let's keep the hose from kinking

17:49.468 --> 17:51.069
till we change it.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.672
Bode, Freddy. Come.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.000
Position the airbag
under the axle.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.474
Position the airbag
under the axle.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.042
All right. On it.

17:57.109 --> 17:58.644
EVE:
Once we lift and crib,
we should have

17:58.710 --> 18:00.000
Charlie out in no time,
you guys.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.412
Charlie out in no time,
you guys.

18:00.479 --> 18:01.613
All right,
couple of these.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.148
Let's turn it.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.983
(mutters)

18:05.050 --> 18:06.000
(grunts)

18:06.000 --> 18:06.084
(grunts)

18:09.455 --> 18:11.657
(air hissing)

18:14.593 --> 18:16.962
Sorry about this, Cap.
MANNY: Don't do that,

18:17.029 --> 18:18.000
Charlie, you have nothing
to apologize for.

18:18.000 --> 18:18.997
Charlie, you have nothing
to apologize for.

18:19.064 --> 18:21.767
We're gonna get
you out of here.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.000
Hey, uh, Cap,
you okay?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.705
Hey, uh, Cap,
you okay?

18:28.240 --> 18:29.942
How the hell can an inmate
get injured on my watch

18:30.008 --> 18:31.443
and me not be the
first one to notice?

18:31.510 --> 18:32.811
Well, that's chaos.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.546
We handled every single
situation as it emerged.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.000
It's fine.
You've had my guys' back

18:36.000 --> 18:36.415
It's fine.
You've had my guys' back

18:36.482 --> 18:37.983
all day today.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.384
And it was way too much
for me to handle on my own.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.853
Thank you.

18:40.919 --> 18:42.000
It's teamwork, Cap.
Hey, you know,

18:42.000 --> 18:43.655
It's teamwork, Cap.
Hey, you know,

18:43.722 --> 18:45.724
I just want you to know
that I see you.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.159
You're pulling more
than your own weight.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.000
And it's for my guys,
and I appreciate that.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.027
And it's for my guys,
and I appreciate that.

18:49.094 --> 18:50.863
I appreciate you.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.000
MANNY:
Come on, guys, we need
to get Charlie home.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.267
MANNY:
Come on, guys, we need
to get Charlie home.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.136
I miss this house.

18:58.203 --> 18:59.738
Family dinners.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.000
Oh, yeah, you were
a frequent flier on Sundays.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.407
Oh, yeah, you were
a frequent flier on Sundays.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.609
(Cara laughs)

19:03.675 --> 19:06.000
Vince's Sunday sauce.

19:06.000 --> 19:06.879
Vince's Sunday sauce.

19:06.945 --> 19:07.980
Mm-hmm.

19:10.782 --> 19:12.000
You and me,
we used to be close.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.619
You and me,
we used to be close.

19:13.685 --> 19:16.221
Made inappropriate
jokes.

19:16.288 --> 19:17.956
(chuckles)

19:18.023 --> 19:20.993
You took me to get my IUD
when my mom was working.

19:21.059 --> 19:23.295
Oh, yeah.

19:23.362 --> 19:24.000
Now you're polite.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.331
Now you're polite.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.735
Like I'm anybody else
around this town.

19:29.801 --> 19:30.000
I can't stand polite.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.204
I can't stand polite.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.000
Our family's been through a lot.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.108
Our family's been through a lot.

19:36.174 --> 19:38.744
You're saying we grew apart
because of Riley?

19:38.810 --> 19:41.580
No. It was before that.

19:41.647 --> 19:42.000
You dumped Bode
pretty quickly

19:42.000 --> 19:44.650
You dumped Bode
pretty quickly

19:44.716 --> 19:45.851
after his injury.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.219
And then
he also lost baseball.

19:47.286 --> 19:48.000
All of that led to the pills.
That was--

19:48.000 --> 19:49.254
All of that led to the pills.
That was--

19:49.321 --> 19:52.057
That was hard
for a mama to swallow.

19:53.992 --> 19:54.000
Is that what Bode told you?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.994
Is that what Bode told you?

19:57.796 --> 20:00.000
All right. Come on,
hit the seat of this fire.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.532
All right. Come on,
hit the seat of this fire.

20:03.669 --> 20:06.000
There it is.
Come on, come on.

20:06.000 --> 20:06.238
There it is.
Come on, come on.

20:08.106 --> 20:10.275
All right. That should do it.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.314
Good one.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.516
All right,
good job.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.000
Gonna be a hell
of an overhaul.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.184
Gonna be a hell
of an overhaul.

20:19.251 --> 20:22.154
Yeah, well, good thing
Three Rock's here.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.000
Yeah. We're gonna join 'em.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.625
Yeah. We're gonna join 'em.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.894
On the overhaul?

20:30.495 --> 20:33.966
Yeah. You got
a problem with that?

20:34.032 --> 20:35.767
No.

20:35.834 --> 20:36.000
No, Bode and I are good.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.036
No, Bode and I are good.

20:38.103 --> 20:39.972
Good.

20:40.038 --> 20:42.000
Afterwards, we'll cook up
a big meal for everybody.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.076
Afterwards, we'll cook up
a big meal for everybody.

20:44.142 --> 20:46.178
Copy that.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.850
How you doing, Charlie?
I'm not going anywhere.
(chuckles)

20:56.822 --> 20:58.190
Well, maybe Charlie
shouldn't be the only one

20:58.256 --> 21:00.000
applying to Cal Fire.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.258
applying to Cal Fire.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.794
You thought about joining,
Bode?

21:02.861 --> 21:04.663
Charlie's the one
getting out today.

21:04.730 --> 21:05.931
It'll be your time soon.

21:05.998 --> 21:06.000
You just gotta plan and prepare.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.966
You just gotta plan and prepare.

21:09.501 --> 21:11.970
Yo, goat, we need to make
more room to extricate him.

21:12.037 --> 21:14.072
Let's get this thing
out of here.
Copy, Cap.

21:17.275 --> 21:18.000
What's wrong?

21:18.000 --> 21:18.243
What's wrong?

21:18.310 --> 21:19.745
(grunts)
It's wedged.

21:19.811 --> 21:21.179
Well, then, let's inflate
the airbag a little bit more.

21:21.246 --> 21:22.481
Let's go.

21:22.547 --> 21:24.000
Come on. Up on blue, buddy.
We got this.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.416
Come on. Up on blue, buddy.
We got this.

21:24.483 --> 21:28.620
Easy on that bag, goat.
We just need one more inch.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.000
Glad this is my last day
of taking in

21:30.000 --> 21:30.088
Glad this is my last day
of taking in

21:30.155 --> 21:31.890
that smug mug of yours.
(chuckles)

21:31.957 --> 21:33.525
I thought you loved my smile.

21:33.592 --> 21:35.160
I was just being nice.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.000
(air hissing)

21:36.000 --> 21:36.328
(air hissing)

21:36.395 --> 21:38.630
(cries out)
Brace!

21:38.697 --> 21:40.265
(engine creaking)

21:40.332 --> 21:41.533
Weight's shifting.

21:42.367 --> 21:45.003
Bode, chase it and stick it.
What does that mean?

21:45.070 --> 21:47.606
The rig is unstable. This could
slam back down onto Charlie.

21:47.673 --> 21:48.000
More! Go. Go!

21:48.000 --> 21:49.074
More! Go. Go!

21:55.013 --> 21:56.415
MANNY: Come on, Freddy,
put those biceps to work.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.050
We're almost there.
(grunts) Good.

21:58.116 --> 22:00.000
Bode, wedge that chase cribbing.

22:00.000 --> 22:00.585
Bode, wedge that chase cribbing.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.387
I got it.

22:02.454 --> 22:05.223
Young blood, is this thing
gonna crush me?

22:05.290 --> 22:06.000
We're not gonna let it.
(creaking)

22:06.000 --> 22:06.958
We're not gonna let it.
(creaking)

22:07.025 --> 22:08.427
VINCE (over radio):
Nearby stations
are all backed up.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.062
We're working
as fast as we can,

22:10.128 --> 22:12.000
making sure the fire's
not extended. How's Charlie?

22:12.000 --> 22:12.330
making sure the fire's
not extended. How's Charlie?

22:12.397 --> 22:14.633
Airbags are making
the rig unstable.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.201
We're working to secure it.

22:16.268 --> 22:17.836
I need the struts,
but we can't get to them.

22:17.903 --> 22:18.000
Just keep at it, Eve.

22:18.000 --> 22:18.837
Just keep at it, Eve.

22:18.904 --> 22:20.372
We'll be right over.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.207
SHARON:
Come on.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.000
You're saying Bode dumped you?
Yeah.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.309
You're saying Bode dumped you?
Yeah.

22:24.376 --> 22:26.878
I was heartbroken.

22:26.945 --> 22:30.000
Baseball had become
his whole identity,

22:30.000 --> 22:30.115
Baseball had become
his whole identity,

22:30.182 --> 22:33.018
and losing it

22:33.085 --> 22:34.686
killed all his confidence.

22:34.753 --> 22:36.000
Because he loved it
so much.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.455
Because he loved it
so much.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.423
I think
it's because

22:38.490 --> 22:40.225
Vince loved it.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.000
Oh...
Bode just wanted his dad
to be proud of him.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.029
Oh...
Bode just wanted his dad
to be proud of him.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.397
Oh...

22:45.464 --> 22:48.000
Baseball was the quickest way
to Vince's heart.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.633
Baseball was the quickest way
to Vince's heart.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.403
I think going for
Cal Fire was, um,

22:51.470 --> 22:53.238
was too loaded,

22:53.305 --> 22:54.000
and baseball came
naturally to him.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.042
and baseball came
naturally to him.

22:57.109 --> 23:00.000
And Vince liked it, too, so...

23:00.000 --> 23:01.513
And Vince liked it, too, so...

23:01.580 --> 23:03.915
I can't believe
I didn't see this.

23:06.785 --> 23:09.287
Ow. Ow!

23:09.354 --> 23:12.000
(inhales sharply)

23:12.000 --> 23:12.190
(inhales sharply)

23:12.257 --> 23:13.191
Ooh.
Cara?

23:13.258 --> 23:14.693
Mm, that's weird.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.596
I have shooting pains
up my arm.

23:17.662 --> 23:18.000
The cord didn't
hit me there, did it?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.397
The cord didn't
hit me there, did it?

23:19.464 --> 23:20.699
I can't see in the back.
No.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.300
No, I don't see...
(groans)

23:22.367 --> 23:24.000
Oh, damn it, Cara,
you have an exit wound.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.070
Oh, damn it, Cara,
you have an exit wound.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.605
Oh, my God. Okay.
Oh...

23:26.671 --> 23:29.407
Cara...
That means it crossed
the midline.

23:29.474 --> 23:30.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.343
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

23:31.409 --> 23:32.711
(panting)

23:32.778 --> 23:34.746
I'm 29. I can't be
having a heart attack.

23:34.813 --> 23:36.000
Ugh! Where is this ambulance?!

23:36.000 --> 23:37.682
Ugh! Where is this ambulance?!

23:37.749 --> 23:40.185
Okay, forget it.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.000
I have a 29-year-old female
with an electrical burn

23:42.000 --> 23:43.288
I have a 29-year-old female
with an electrical burn

23:43.355 --> 23:44.723
and a possible cardiac event,

23:44.790 --> 23:46.358
and an ambulance that
should have been here

23:46.424 --> 23:48.000
a long time ago.
Send one!

23:48.000 --> 23:48.593
a long time ago.
Send one!

23:48.660 --> 23:50.228
MAN (over radio):
Yes, Chief. You're in the queue,

23:50.295 --> 23:51.296
but we're very backed up.

23:51.363 --> 23:53.198
Okay, stick with me.
Mrs. L?

23:53.265 --> 23:54.000
No. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.734
No. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.435
(groans)

23:58.203 --> 24:00.000
Okay, here we go.

24:00.000 --> 24:00.438
Okay, here we go.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.341
Come on, Cara.

24:06.044 --> 24:07.179
EVE:
Good, good.

24:07.245 --> 24:08.780
The rig's almost stable.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.348
We need a spine board
at the ready.

24:10.415 --> 24:12.000
As soon as his leg's free,
we slide him out.

24:12.000 --> 24:12.717
As soon as his leg's free,
we slide him out.

24:12.784 --> 24:15.720
My clothes feel wet and cold.

24:15.787 --> 24:16.988
(sniffs)

24:17.055 --> 24:18.000
Is that leaking fuel?

24:18.000 --> 24:18.723
Is that leaking fuel?

24:18.790 --> 24:21.359
We should throw
some absorbent on it,

24:21.426 --> 24:22.594
neutralize
the threat.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.000
MANNY:
That's not fuel, guys.

24:24.000 --> 24:24.629
MANNY:
That's not fuel, guys.

24:24.696 --> 24:26.598
Is that...
He's bleeding.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.099
BODE:
He probably has
been for a while.

24:28.166 --> 24:30.000
Bode, don't start whispering
about me now, too, man.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.069
Bode, don't start whispering
about me now, too, man.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.339
Hit me with it.
Look, Charlie, you're bleeding.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.000
I'm-I'm not sure
where it's coming from.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.342
I'm-I'm not sure
where it's coming from.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.813
If it's the femoral...
Then we work double time.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.000
'Cause Charlie is not
bleeding out under our watch

24:42.000 --> 24:43.648
'Cause Charlie is not
bleeding out under our watch

24:43.715 --> 24:45.483
on his last damn hour
on my crew.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.786
It's not gonna happen, Eve.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.056
(panting)

24:52.457 --> 24:54.000
I need my leg

24:54.000 --> 24:55.427
I need my leg

24:55.493 --> 24:57.929
to be a firefighter.

24:59.231 --> 25:00.000
Something for my grandkids

25:00.000 --> 25:02.834
Something for my grandkids

25:02.901 --> 25:05.871
that's not Grandpa the inmate.

25:07.272 --> 25:09.941
Without my leg,

25:10.008 --> 25:12.000
there's no hope.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.244
there's no hope.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.746
No, no, Charlie,
don't give up hope.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.616
I might not have a choice.

25:19.618 --> 25:24.000
Look, man, life...
life will surprise you.

25:24.000 --> 25:24.956
Look, man, life...
life will surprise you.

25:25.023 --> 25:29.661
You know, growing up
in this station

25:29.728 --> 25:30.000
was the last place
that I ever wanted to be.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.030
was the last place
that I ever wanted to be.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.333
I-I didn't think
that I was worthy

25:35.400 --> 25:36.000
of wearing a Cal Fire uniform.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.002
of wearing a Cal Fire uniform.

25:38.837 --> 25:42.000
Hell, I didn't think that
I was worthy of being a Leone.

25:42.000 --> 25:42.173
Hell, I didn't think that
I was worthy of being a Leone.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.376
That's my real last name.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.177
My family name.

25:46.244 --> 25:48.000
You know, but...

25:48.000 --> 25:48.280
You know, but...

25:48.346 --> 25:51.716
I finally realized that...

25:51.783 --> 25:54.000
I have a family here
at Cal Fire,

25:54.000 --> 25:54.252
I have a family here
at Cal Fire,

25:54.319 --> 25:58.056
whether I deserve one or not,
and so do you.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.000
All right? So-so quit talking
all that nonsense,

26:00.000 --> 26:01.226
All right? So-so quit talking
all that nonsense,

26:01.293 --> 26:02.727
and hang in there.

26:13.204 --> 26:15.941
Hey, where do you want me?

26:16.007 --> 26:18.000
All right, the truck is
staunching the bleeding,

26:18.000 --> 26:18.643
All right, the truck is
staunching the bleeding,

26:18.710 --> 26:20.578
so if it's
his femoral artery,

26:20.645 --> 26:23.415
he could bleed out
in minutes.
Yeah.

26:23.481 --> 26:24.000
So we need a tourniquet
and packing

26:24.000 --> 26:25.583
So we need a tourniquet
and packing

26:25.650 --> 26:26.818
the second he gets out,
all right?

26:26.885 --> 26:28.820
Yeah. Hey, we got this.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.000
We ain't gonna leave
this firefighter behind.

26:30.000 --> 26:30.355
We ain't gonna leave
this firefighter behind.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.058
MANNY:
Okay, guys, ready
to lift the engine.

26:33.124 --> 26:34.392
Up on blue.

26:34.459 --> 26:36.000
Pupils are equal and reactive.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.362
Pupils are equal and reactive.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.799
Come on, Cara, honey.
You with me?

26:40.865 --> 26:42.000
Good girl. Yes.
(Cara coughing)

26:42.000 --> 26:43.134
Good girl. Yes.
(Cara coughing)

26:43.201 --> 26:44.869
(groans)

26:44.936 --> 26:47.272
Ahh. Ahh.

26:47.339 --> 26:48.000
You need an AED.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.274
You need an AED.

26:49.341 --> 26:50.842
Defibrillator?

26:50.909 --> 26:52.811
That's good.
That's really good.

26:52.877 --> 26:54.000
If help ever gets here.
Where are the EMTs?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.880
If help ever gets here.
Where are the EMTs?

26:55.947 --> 26:57.048
Mrs. L.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.985
Mrs. L...
Your hands are clammy.

27:00.051 --> 27:01.119
How's your pulse?

27:01.186 --> 27:04.656
I worry about
your condition.

27:04.723 --> 27:06.000
That's...
a really good assessment.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.392
That's...
a really good assessment.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.894
You're gonna make
an excellent nurse.
(phone buzzing)

27:12.130 --> 27:13.298
Vince.
Hey.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.401
I'm here with Cara,
from next door.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.736
Cara?

27:17.802 --> 27:18.000
Heartbreaker Cara?

27:18.000 --> 27:18.970
Heartbreaker Cara?

27:19.037 --> 27:21.339
Oh, boy,
we're on speakerphone.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.541
Oh. Hi, Cara.

27:23.608 --> 27:24.000
Hi.
Cara has an electric burn

27:24.000 --> 27:26.311
Hi.
Cara has an electric burn

27:26.378 --> 27:28.480
with an exit wound,
and I just brought her back

27:28.546 --> 27:29.481
from a cardiac arrest.

27:29.547 --> 27:30.000
Wait, you did CPR?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.916
Wait, you did CPR?

27:31.983 --> 27:34.019
Sharon, that...
that's strenuous.

27:34.085 --> 27:35.987
That's really bad
for your kidney condition.

27:36.054 --> 27:37.188
Cara needed it,

27:37.255 --> 27:38.757
and an ambulance,
but that last part's

27:38.823 --> 27:40.392
really taking a long time.
You sound winded.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.626
CARA:
Mr. L, she's spent.

27:41.693 --> 27:42.000
I'm really worried
about her fading.

27:42.000 --> 27:42.694
I'm really worried
about her fading.

27:42.761 --> 27:44.462
(pained groan)

27:44.529 --> 27:45.964
I'd really like to return
the CPR favor,

27:46.031 --> 27:47.732
but I'm pretty weak myself.

27:47.799 --> 27:48.000
Your dialysis stopped when
the power went out, right?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.434
Your dialysis stopped when
the power went out, right?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.136
And the A/C, too.

27:51.202 --> 27:53.638
If the ambulance ever comes,
I'll get in it with her.

27:53.705 --> 27:54.000
It's the least they can do.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.007
It's the least they can do.

27:56.074 --> 27:57.008
(Cara shudders)

27:57.075 --> 27:58.309
Mr. L, it's not looking good.

27:58.376 --> 28:00.000
She really needs
an ambulance.
(exhales)

28:00.000 --> 28:00.245
She really needs
an ambulance.
(exhales)

28:00.311 --> 28:01.312
Okay, Sharon, I'm coming to you.

28:01.379 --> 28:02.313
Hang in there.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.449
Cara, you're gonna get

28:04.516 --> 28:05.683
a real-life
nursing intensive.

28:05.750 --> 28:06.000
I might pass out, honey,
but that's okay.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.452
I might pass out, honey,
but that's okay.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.486
It's happened before.

28:08.553 --> 28:10.488
Could you elevate my feet?

28:10.555 --> 28:12.000
And then it's all about
the airway.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.658
And then it's all about
the airway.

28:13.725 --> 28:15.460
You gotta remember
to keep it clear.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.895
I won't be able to remind you.

28:16.961 --> 28:18.000
Airway.

28:18.000 --> 28:18.296
Airway.

28:18.363 --> 28:22.667
(grunts) Airway. Airway.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.571
(indistinct chatter)

28:27.372 --> 28:28.573
(gasps)

28:28.640 --> 28:30.000
I'm sorry,
I know this hurts.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.276
I'm sorry,
I know this hurts.

28:32.343 --> 28:35.547
You're that Olympic diver,
aren't you?

28:35.613 --> 28:36.000
In a past life, yeah.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.216
In a past life, yeah.

28:38.283 --> 28:40.752
Wow. You're really brave.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.000
Mm, firefighting is
way scarier, trust me.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.589
Mm, firefighting is
way scarier, trust me.

28:44.656 --> 28:46.057
Yeah, you had
a whole career,

28:46.124 --> 28:48.000
and now you're
starting a new one.

28:48.000 --> 28:48.159
and now you're
starting a new one.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.795
How do you know what you
want and just go for it?

28:50.862 --> 28:53.298
I always wanted to
open my own bakery,

28:53.364 --> 28:54.000
ever since I got my
first standing mixer.

28:54.000 --> 28:54.866
ever since I got my
first standing mixer.

28:54.933 --> 28:57.936
But restaurants are risky,

28:58.002 --> 29:00.000
so I put it out of my mind

29:00.000 --> 29:00.972
so I put it out of my mind

29:01.039 --> 29:02.340
and told myself I could settle

29:02.407 --> 29:03.775
for my salaried accounting job.

29:03.842 --> 29:05.977
But here I am,
years later,

29:06.044 --> 29:08.146
finally going after
what I wanted all along.

29:08.213 --> 29:12.000
You didn't waste any time going
after what you really want.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.150
You didn't waste any time going
after what you really want.

29:12.217 --> 29:14.252
You must be wise
beyond your years.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.688
Nice work, Gabs.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.592
You might be right
about my work life,

29:20.658 --> 29:23.695
but I doubt
you'd feel the same way

29:23.761 --> 29:24.000
about the rest of it.
Whatever it is,

29:24.000 --> 29:25.864
about the rest of it.
Whatever it is,

29:25.930 --> 29:27.565
don't make my mistakes.

29:27.632 --> 29:28.833
Don't wait.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.000
Follow your
heart now.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.870
Follow your
heart now.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.539
MANNY:
All right, the engine's lifted.
Let's go.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.640
EVE:
Get ready to pack the wound.

29:35.707 --> 29:36.000
All right, Bode,
you and me.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.741
All right, Bode,
you and me.

29:36.808 --> 29:37.876
One slide, all right?
Yeah.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.812
One, two, three, slide.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.816
One, two,
three, slide.

29:44.883 --> 29:47.919
Okay, Freddy, I want
you to pack this wound

29:47.986 --> 29:48.000
and keep pressure on it.
Okay.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.787
and keep pressure on it.
Okay.

29:49.854 --> 29:51.289
There, pack it tight.

29:51.356 --> 29:53.958
EVE:
See, Charlie?
Your leg is in one piece.

29:54.759 --> 29:56.728
Have that splint
ready for me.

29:56.794 --> 29:59.397
I want you to get it
all the way to the top.

30:04.736 --> 30:05.970
How's our guy doing?

30:06.037 --> 30:08.173
He's out, thank God.
Hey,

30:08.239 --> 30:09.707
I need the engine.

30:09.774 --> 30:10.909
I-I got two patients.
It's urgent.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.000
I need transport,
lights and sirens.

30:12.000 --> 30:12.677
I need transport,
lights and sirens.

30:12.744 --> 30:13.845
All right, we got you.
Hey, guys,

30:13.912 --> 30:15.280
let's get this box truck
out of here

30:15.346 --> 30:16.648
and get the chief an engine;
let's get Charlie home.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.000
Freddy, Ramirez,
you're with me.

30:18.000 --> 30:18.082
Freddy, Ramirez,
you're with me.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.517
Soon as the engine's
free, we go.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.386
Wait. Can I help?

30:21.452 --> 30:23.454
I need you here.

30:23.521 --> 30:24.000
Making me proud.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.156
Making me proud.

30:25.223 --> 30:26.324
I heard you earlier.

30:26.391 --> 30:27.759
Why don't you think about

30:27.825 --> 30:28.993
changing that sticker, huh?

30:29.060 --> 30:30.000
I don't know who Donovan is,

30:30.000 --> 30:30.461
I don't know who Donovan is,

30:30.528 --> 30:31.996
but it's not your name.

30:35.934 --> 30:36.000
CHARLIE:
Bode.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.102
CHARLIE:
Bode.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.338
Hey, we got you.
We got you. All right, man?

30:40.405 --> 30:42.000
We got you.

30:42.000 --> 30:42.674
We got you.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.842
Pulse is weak
and thready.

30:44.909 --> 30:46.244
Charlie?
FREDDY:
Hang on, man!

30:46.311 --> 30:47.245
He's crashing.

30:47.312 --> 30:48.000
Eve? Eve,
what's going on?

30:48.000 --> 30:48.813
Eve? Eve,
what's going on?

30:48.880 --> 30:50.114
EVE:
Lost pulse.

30:51.482 --> 30:53.585
Starting CPR.
What?

30:53.651 --> 30:54.000
BODE:
No. No, no, no.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.253
BODE:
No. No, no, no.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.188
JAKE:
Come on, come on.
Over here, guys.

30:57.255 --> 30:58.856
BODE:
We can't lose him.

31:00.525 --> 31:01.659
Start the IV.

31:01.726 --> 31:03.528
Run it wide open, okay?

31:03.595 --> 31:06.000
Come on, Charlie, this is not
how this ends for you.

31:06.000 --> 31:06.364
Come on, Charlie, this is not
how this ends for you.

31:13.104 --> 31:15.340
(Eve grunting)

31:19.043 --> 31:20.445
He still doesn't have a pulse.

31:20.511 --> 31:22.714
He can't die on his last day.
BODE:
He won't.

31:22.780 --> 31:24.000
But if he wakes up without
a leg, he's gonna be pissed.

31:24.000 --> 31:24.682
But if he wakes up without
a leg, he's gonna be pissed.

31:24.749 --> 31:26.517
So make sure you keep
pressure on that thing.

31:26.584 --> 31:28.786
MANNY:
Let's go, Charlie. Come on.

31:30.755 --> 31:32.857
I got a pulse.
FREDDY: He's alive.

31:32.924 --> 31:34.892
Oh, thank God.

31:34.959 --> 31:36.000
Hey. Hey, Charlie,
you with me?

31:36.000 --> 31:36.894
Hey. Hey, Charlie,
you with me?

31:37.895 --> 31:38.997
You again?

31:39.063 --> 31:40.498
(Eve laughs)
FREDDY:
There's my man.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.000
EVE: There you go,
Charlie. Good.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.501
EVE: There you go,
Charlie. Good.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.603
Can I get a nonrebreather
on him?

31:45.670 --> 31:48.000
15 liters per minute,
and another tourniquet on.

31:48.000 --> 31:48.506
15 liters per minute,
and another tourniquet on.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.375
PARAMEDIC:
You got it.

31:51.476 --> 31:52.810
Don't sugarcoat it.
Is he...

31:52.877 --> 31:54.000
He's critical,
but he's okay.

31:54.000 --> 31:54.612
He's critical,
but he's okay.

31:54.679 --> 31:56.514
We did it.
He's alive.

31:56.581 --> 31:59.083
You doing all right, Cap?
What?

31:59.150 --> 32:00.000
Yeah. Yeah, I just--

32:00.000 --> 32:01.185
Yeah. Yeah, I just--

32:01.252 --> 32:03.421
I-I just haven't been sleeping
much lately, that's it.

32:03.488 --> 32:04.722
Well, you told that
driver to get help.

32:04.789 --> 32:06.000
Maybe follow your
own advice, huh?

32:06.000 --> 32:06.958
Maybe follow your
own advice, huh?

32:07.025 --> 32:08.826
Right.

32:08.893 --> 32:10.628
Yeah, after this,
no more double shifts.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.000
Hey, all due respect, Cap,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.699
Hey, all due respect, Cap,

32:14.766 --> 32:16.534
is it just the doubles?

32:16.601 --> 32:18.000
You don't... you don't
have to talk to me,

32:18.000 --> 32:21.139
You don't... you don't
have to talk to me,

32:21.205 --> 32:24.000
but Chief Leone, he's
helped me through a lot.

32:24.000 --> 32:24.375
but Chief Leone, he's
helped me through a lot.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.811
Maybe he can help you.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.950
(door opens)

32:33.017 --> 32:34.686
Oh, God.

32:34.752 --> 32:36.000
Sharon.

32:36.000 --> 32:36.621
Sharon.

32:36.688 --> 32:38.089
Need a line, guys.

32:38.156 --> 32:39.157
PARAMEDIC:
Yes, Chief.

32:39.223 --> 32:40.091
How long's she been like this?

32:40.158 --> 32:41.259
About ten minutes.

32:41.326 --> 32:42.000
I've been putting
cold cloths on her

32:42.000 --> 32:42.327
I've been putting
cold cloths on her

32:42.393 --> 32:44.162
and keeping
her airway clear.

32:44.228 --> 32:45.697
She's tachycardic
and diaphoretic.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.332
She needs
a diuretic stat.

32:47.398 --> 32:48.000
Thank you, Cara.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.033
Thank you, Cara.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.203
PARAMEDIC 2:
You're wide open, sir.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.338
VINCE:
Come on, babe.

32:53.404 --> 32:54.000
Time to wake up.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.106
Time to wake up.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.774
PARAMEDIC:
Grab a saline.

32:58.810 --> 32:59.777
(grunts)

32:59.844 --> 33:00.000
What's up?

33:00.000 --> 33:00.978
What's up?

33:01.045 --> 33:03.781
My patient today
made me realize something.

33:10.555 --> 33:12.000
You see me.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.558
You see me.

33:13.624 --> 33:15.927
You support me.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.000
And I do love you.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.530
And I do love you.

33:20.598 --> 33:22.834
So much, Jake.

33:27.071 --> 33:29.807
Which is...

33:29.874 --> 33:30.000
why it makes this so hard.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.577
why it makes this so hard.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.000
Makes what so hard?

33:36.000 --> 33:36.781
Makes what so hard?

33:38.583 --> 33:40.518
(sighs)

33:42.754 --> 33:44.989
I have feelings for Bode.

34:03.641 --> 34:06.000
Yeah. I knew it.

34:06.000 --> 34:06.277
Yeah. I knew it.

34:06.344 --> 34:07.745
I don't want
to have feelings.

34:07.812 --> 34:10.548
I don't even want
to pursue anything with him.

34:10.615 --> 34:11.949
It doesn't make any sense...
Please.

34:12.016 --> 34:16.387
Gabs, I really don't want
to help you weigh

34:16.454 --> 34:18.000
on whether or not to date Bode.

34:18.000 --> 34:18.389
on whether or not to date Bode.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.825
I don't know. I...
(sniffles)

34:21.692 --> 34:24.000
I only mentioned it
so that you'd understand

34:24.000 --> 34:25.897
I only mentioned it
so that you'd understand

34:25.963 --> 34:29.434
that I'm not jumping
from you to someone else.

34:30.535 --> 34:31.702
But...

34:31.769 --> 34:33.471
I can't be with you

34:33.538 --> 34:36.000
if my heart is not
fully with you.

34:36.000 --> 34:36.507
if my heart is not
fully with you.

34:38.843 --> 34:42.000
I respect you too much, Jake.

34:42.000 --> 34:42.447
I respect you too much, Jake.

34:49.053 --> 34:51.389
I hate this.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.990
(exhales)

34:54.759 --> 34:57.094
VINCE:
Come on.

34:59.597 --> 35:00.000
There she is.
SHARON: Hmm?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.966
There she is.
SHARON: Hmm?

35:05.870 --> 35:06.000
Vince...

35:06.000 --> 35:07.872
Vince...

35:07.939 --> 35:10.007
You become
transplant-eligible

35:10.074 --> 35:12.000
and almost kill yourself
in the same day.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.110
and almost kill yourself
in the same day.

35:13.177 --> 35:14.645
Where's Cara?

35:14.712 --> 35:17.081
Is she okay?

35:17.148 --> 35:18.000
Yeah, yeah, she's...

35:18.000 --> 35:19.484
Yeah, yeah, she's...

35:19.550 --> 35:20.985
she's fine,
thanks to you.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.787
I let her go in
the first ambulance.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.000
Oh, good.
And how is everybody?

35:24.000 --> 35:25.122
Oh, good.
And how is everybody?

35:25.189 --> 35:28.559
How is Bode?
How was getting your hopes up?

35:29.760 --> 35:30.000
Um, I actually didn't

35:30.000 --> 35:32.830
Um, I actually didn't

35:32.897 --> 35:35.266
till I saw him today.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.538
Okay, Cara told me

35:40.605 --> 35:42.000
that Bode broke up with her,

35:42.000 --> 35:42.773
that Bode broke up with her,

35:42.840 --> 35:46.677
and baseball was just a way
to get your affection.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.000
So... we like Cara again?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.548
So... we like Cara again?

35:50.615 --> 35:53.584
Oh, yeah.
Bode lied about that breakup.

35:53.651 --> 35:54.000
I'm a little worried that...

35:54.000 --> 35:56.821
I'm a little worried that...

35:56.888 --> 36:00.000
I'm not giving him
enough room to make mistakes,

36:00.000 --> 36:00.024
I'm not giving him
enough room to make mistakes,

36:00.091 --> 36:02.593
'cause I'm so worried
for him to be okay.

36:02.660 --> 36:05.096
Maybe I have to listen
a little bit more.

36:06.964 --> 36:10.968
Mm. That go for everybody, or...
(door opens)

36:11.035 --> 36:12.000
VINCE:
Where the hell you been?

36:12.000 --> 36:12.803
VINCE:
Where the hell you been?

36:12.870 --> 36:15.406
This response time
is totally disgraceful.

36:15.473 --> 36:17.208
You should be ashamed.

36:17.275 --> 36:18.000
(indistinct chatter)

36:18.000 --> 36:19.310
(indistinct chatter)

36:26.050 --> 36:27.685
(sighs)

36:29.587 --> 36:30.000
Sharon is okay.
Vince is with her.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.290
Sharon is okay.
Vince is with her.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.791
What, you moving in?

36:33.858 --> 36:35.927
No. No, just, uh...

36:35.993 --> 36:36.000
just helping with overhaul.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.595
just helping with overhaul.

36:37.662 --> 36:41.232
"No, just, uh, helping
with overhaul."

36:42.300 --> 36:45.403
Bode, it's me, man.

36:45.469 --> 36:46.938
Think about this.

36:47.004 --> 36:48.000
You, me, Jake, Vince,

36:48.000 --> 36:49.707
You, me, Jake, Vince,

36:49.774 --> 36:52.109
here at the station.

36:52.176 --> 36:53.711
It could be fun.

36:53.778 --> 36:54.000
Yeah, but what about all these
guys who don't have my name?

36:54.000 --> 36:55.913
Yeah, but what about all these
guys who don't have my name?

36:55.980 --> 36:59.283
You know? Freddy, Charlie?

37:00.451 --> 37:01.786
Listen, what
I saw today--

37:01.852 --> 37:05.790
what-what I've seen
with you and Three Rock--

37:05.856 --> 37:06.000
is a crew of
very capable firefighters.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.893
is a crew of
very capable firefighters.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.000
This transition between
Fire Camp and Fire Station

37:12.000 --> 37:12.496
This transition between
Fire Camp and Fire Station

37:12.563 --> 37:13.698
has to be easier.

37:13.764 --> 37:15.366
Wouldn't that
be nice?

37:15.433 --> 37:17.168
That red tape's
pretty crazy.

37:17.234 --> 37:18.000
Well, what if we change
that? You and me.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.770
Well, what if we change
that? You and me.

37:19.837 --> 37:22.907
Guys, it's past noon.
Charlie's done.

37:22.974 --> 37:24.000
The CO says he's
not coming back

37:24.000 --> 37:25.843
The CO says he's
not coming back

37:25.910 --> 37:28.379
after he goes to the hospital.

37:28.446 --> 37:30.000
It's goodbye.

37:30.000 --> 37:30.147
It's goodbye.

37:30.214 --> 37:32.316
Come on, Mills,
we don't have all day.

37:32.383 --> 37:33.884
You, too, Donovan.
Hustle up.

37:33.951 --> 37:36.000
Actually, it's Leone.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.888
Actually, it's Leone.

37:47.264 --> 37:48.000

You guys know
he's diabetic, right?
