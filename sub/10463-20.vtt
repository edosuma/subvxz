WEBVTT

00:03.107 --> 00:05.492
It's incredible news.

00:06.277 --> 00:07.703
Karen Klimsky...

00:08.487 --> 00:10.122
...said maybe.

00:10.406 --> 00:12.509
- She said maybe?
- Amazing, huh?

00:12.533 --> 00:14.177
She said maybe she'd
go out with you?

00:14.201 --> 00:15.961
She definitely said maybe.

00:19.165 --> 00:20.559
Well, so when will
you know for sure?

00:20.583 --> 00:21.685
Very soon.

00:21.709 --> 00:23.552
Look, Will,

00:23.669 --> 00:25.763
not to throw water on
this or anything...

00:27.423 --> 00:28.641
Will...

00:29.008 --> 00:30.652
What are you playing games for?

00:30.676 --> 00:33.238
I mean, that girl, uh,
Donna what's-her-name...

00:33.262 --> 00:34.281
- Sheingold.
- Yeah!

00:34.305 --> 00:35.824
If she's actually
interested in you...

00:35.848 --> 00:38.859
I mean, she practically follows you
around the cafeteria at lunch.

00:39.060 --> 00:41.288
Have you ever seen that show
<i>Let's Make a Deal,</i> Bay?

00:41.312 --> 00:42.205
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:42.229 --> 00:44.416
Donna Sheingold is like that box

00:44.440 --> 00:46.376
Carol Merrill is
standing next to.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.244
Karen Klimsky is the
big deal of the day.

00:50.237 --> 00:51.131
Take the box, Will.

00:51.155 --> 00:53.467
Oh, that's... That's very
funny coming from you.

00:53.491 --> 00:55.552
I mean, not to be insensitive,
but talk about waiting around

00:55.576 --> 00:57.795
for something that's
not likely to happen.

00:57.828 --> 00:59.598
- It's been like a month, Bay.
- Yeah.

00:59.622 --> 01:01.757
So? You never know.

01:01.916 --> 01:04.061
Well, come on. At least
talk to another girl.

01:04.084 --> 01:06.971
- Look, Will, just mind your own...
- Guess who.

01:07.004 --> 01:08.023
What?

01:08.047 --> 01:10.099
Oh, come on. Don't tell
me you forgot already.

01:12.009 --> 01:13.987
- Kate!
- I knew you'd remember.

01:14.011 --> 01:15.271
Hey, Will.

01:15.846 --> 01:16.981
Oh!

01:17.431 --> 01:18.533
What... what are you doing?

01:18.557 --> 01:20.410
I can't believe I
pulled this off.

01:20.434 --> 01:23.487
I was dying to call you, but I
wanted it to be a surprise.

01:24.021 --> 01:26.541
See, they canceled classes for two
days for this conference thing.

01:26.565 --> 01:30.869
Anyway, all I could think about for a whole
week was seeing the look on your face.

01:32.947 --> 01:34.456
I missed you.

know how to ski.

02:26.792 --> 02:28.844
That's why they have
things called lessons.

02:28.961 --> 02:30.596
Look at this.

02:32.048 --> 02:34.850
You can take a horse-drawn
carriage ride right into town.

02:35.092 --> 02:36.894
What about the kids?
Are we taking them?

02:37.219 --> 02:38.447
You're kidding, right?

02:38.471 --> 02:40.741
We can't just leave
Owen and Claudia.

02:40.765 --> 02:41.867
Why not?

02:41.891 --> 02:43.118
Bill's here during the day.

02:43.142 --> 02:46.320
And Bailey, he's 16. He can
handle it for four days.

02:46.353 --> 02:48.165
And if there is a problem,
which there won't be,

02:48.189 --> 02:51.033
I'm sure that Jill will be
happy to be on-call 24 hours.

02:51.609 --> 02:53.577
Anything else, Miss Positive?

02:54.320 --> 02:55.954
We're gonna do
this right, too...

02:56.238 --> 02:58.592
Rent a huge place
with a roaring fire.

02:58.616 --> 03:01.094
We'll go skiing all day, and then
we'll go out dancing at night.

03:01.118 --> 03:03.921
Oh, Charlie, it sounds
incredible, but...

03:04.038 --> 03:06.057
- What?
- It's just...

03:06.081 --> 03:08.393
Oh, it's so much money.

03:08.417 --> 03:11.730
So what? I have $15,000
sitting in my pocket.

03:11.754 --> 03:14.274
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
just put it in some bank.

03:14.298 --> 03:15.609
If I'm never gonna be
a rich businessman,

03:15.633 --> 03:17.194
at least I'm gonna
have some fun.

03:17.218 --> 03:18.602
I'm gonna live a little.

03:19.053 --> 03:19.946
Okay.

03:19.970 --> 03:21.939
And I don't want to hear
about it from any of them.

03:22.348 --> 03:24.201
No one else has a say anymore.
Just you and me.

03:24.225 --> 03:27.152
My money, my life, my decision.

03:27.645 --> 03:28.946
We're going.

03:31.357 --> 03:35.410
See you tomorrow. Study.
Be smart.

03:37.571 --> 03:39.289
- Julia!
- Hmm?

03:39.657 --> 03:41.125
You got a minute?

03:43.744 --> 03:45.764
I've, uh, I've got
some news for you.

03:45.788 --> 03:46.807
News?

03:46.831 --> 03:48.767
You know that wonderful
short story you wrote,

03:48.791 --> 03:50.843
<i>- The Children's Room?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

03:50.876 --> 03:53.021
Well, this is very exciting.

03:53.045 --> 03:55.565
Every year, <i>SF Magazine</i> sponsors

03:55.589 --> 03:57.516
- a fiction writing contest.
- Oh.

03:58.759 --> 03:59.935
No.

04:00.052 --> 04:02.271
- Oh, no, what?
- I, um...

04:03.013 --> 04:06.159
I don't want to be entered in any
fiction writing contest, Mr. McCoolgen.

04:06.183 --> 04:08.078
Actually, I'd really,

04:08.102 --> 04:10.831
really, really like to be
withdrawn from consideration.

04:10.855 --> 04:13.875
Hmm. Well, it's a
little late for that.

04:13.899 --> 04:15.367
You already won.

04:17.403 --> 04:18.786
Oh, God.

04:19.113 --> 04:20.497
What's the matter?

04:20.947 --> 04:22.958
Nothing. I just, uh...

04:23.075 --> 04:24.427
I'm a little overwhelmed.

04:24.451 --> 04:26.170
It's an incredible honor.

04:26.912 --> 04:28.297
You've no idea.

04:29.540 --> 04:31.017
What exactly do you win?

04:31.041 --> 04:34.521
Well, there's a cash prize
of $1000, I believe,

04:34.545 --> 04:36.638
and a presentation of some sort.

04:36.755 --> 04:40.767
But the best part,
the best part is...

04:40.885 --> 04:41.945
Please don't say it.

04:41.969 --> 04:45.272
They publish your story
in the magazine.

04:48.142 --> 04:49.568
Julia?

04:50.728 --> 04:52.321
Shoot me.

04:52.938 --> 04:55.949
Go ahead and, and
shoot me right now.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.869
Does it come with a Jacuzzi?

05:00.196 --> 05:01.882
I see. Well, we
definitely want one.

05:01.906 --> 05:03.466
How much extra is the Jacuzzi?

05:03.490 --> 05:05.709
And how long can you
keep that reservation?

05:06.619 --> 05:09.046
Great. I'll call
back to confirm.

05:09.496 --> 05:10.714
Thanks a lot.

05:13.709 --> 05:16.011
So, how did it go?

05:16.295 --> 05:17.898
Mallomars, Charlie.

05:17.922 --> 05:19.681
I told you to get Mallomars.

05:19.965 --> 05:21.735
Imitation brands suck.

05:21.759 --> 05:23.310
Well, how many?

05:24.261 --> 05:25.604
A lot.

05:26.513 --> 05:28.607
How many is a lot?

05:29.642 --> 05:31.026
A couple...

05:31.268 --> 05:32.736
A few.

05:34.063 --> 05:35.322
Some.

05:36.315 --> 05:37.532
Six.

05:37.733 --> 05:38.951
Six?

05:39.818 --> 05:41.745
Six? Six cavities?

05:42.279 --> 05:44.539
That's, like, 25 percent
of your teeth, Claud.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.668
You eat way too much sugar.
That's the problem.

05:47.952 --> 05:49.429
I do not.

05:49.453 --> 05:50.347
Yes, you do.

05:50.371 --> 05:52.891
Why don't you have a nice piece of
fruit when you come home from school?

05:52.915 --> 05:54.768
- Why don't you get a haircut?
- I'm serious, Claud.

05:54.792 --> 05:56.519
When was the last time
you had a vegetable?

05:56.543 --> 05:58.762
When was the last time you
put down the toilet seat?

05:58.796 --> 06:00.106
Okay, that is it.

06:00.130 --> 06:01.932
I'm getting rid of
the sugar cereals.

06:03.384 --> 06:04.361
What?

06:04.385 --> 06:06.404
We'll get some of that
sugar-free granola stuff,

06:06.428 --> 06:08.949
and you can have some raisins
and maybe an orange juice bar

06:08.973 --> 06:10.440
when you come home from school.

06:10.683 --> 06:12.192
Wait a sec.

06:12.518 --> 06:13.777
Raisins?

06:14.395 --> 06:15.872
Raisins? Is that a joke?

06:15.896 --> 06:17.572
Do you see me laughing?

06:17.648 --> 06:19.793
Six cavities is completely insane.
At this rate,

06:19.817 --> 06:22.703
you're gonna have enough silver in your
head to set off the alarms at the airport.

06:24.655 --> 06:26.925
Yeah, okay. Fine. Savor it.

06:26.949 --> 06:29.543
It's the last one you're
getting for a long time.

06:33.247 --> 06:35.976
So, like, what exactly were you
writing to her all this time?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.175
I don't know.

06:37.418 --> 06:39.761
I told her about all the
stuff I did with Jill,

06:39.878 --> 06:41.596
only I said I did it with you.

06:43.841 --> 06:45.767
You told her you and
I slept together?

06:46.010 --> 06:47.436
Very funny.

06:49.096 --> 06:51.241
Oh, God. What if she can tell?

06:51.265 --> 06:53.368
Don't take this the wrong
way, Bay, but having sex

06:53.392 --> 06:55.652
hasn't, like, changed you
so that you'd notice.

06:55.811 --> 06:58.822
Yeah, I know, but it would
totally wreck her. I mean...

06:58.981 --> 07:01.042
And it's not even like I'm still with her.
I mean, if we...

07:01.066 --> 07:02.502
...if we were still together...

07:02.526 --> 07:04.453
- You and Jill?
- Right.

07:04.695 --> 07:06.288
Then I'd have to tell her.

07:06.363 --> 07:07.590
- Tell Kate?
- Right.

07:07.614 --> 07:10.000
But we're not together.

07:10.451 --> 07:12.252
- You and Jill?
- Yes!

07:12.369 --> 07:13.712
- Try and keep up, would you?
- Look,

07:13.787 --> 07:16.683
it's not so easy. I mean, are
you and Kate still together?

07:16.707 --> 07:18.717
I know she's assuming
it, but are you?

07:19.293 --> 07:20.761
I loved Kate.

07:20.919 --> 07:22.564
Past tense?

07:22.588 --> 07:24.149
Huh? I said, I love her.

07:24.173 --> 07:25.900
No, you didn't. You
said, "I loved... "

07:25.924 --> 07:27.309
Look, shut up.

07:31.221 --> 07:32.282
I don't know, maybe...

07:32.306 --> 07:34.492
Maybe it took being
with someone like Jill

07:34.516 --> 07:36.777
to make me appreciate being
with someone like her.

07:36.935 --> 07:38.538
Like Kate?

07:38.562 --> 07:39.780
Yeah.

07:40.814 --> 07:42.032
Yeah.

07:43.442 --> 07:45.661
She's great, isn't she? Kate?

07:46.278 --> 07:47.663
She's great.

07:54.828 --> 07:57.390
Hey, man, you seen a
pair of skis anywhere?

07:57.414 --> 07:58.882
Uh, don't think so.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.102
Hey, Charlie, you got a sec?

08:01.126 --> 08:03.387
I know they're back here somewhere.
Aha!

08:06.173 --> 08:08.058
Claudia's. Damn.

08:08.550 --> 08:11.112
Uh, the landlord just
hiked up my rent.

08:11.136 --> 08:13.605
Really? Bummer.

08:13.847 --> 08:15.367
Want to help me with this stuff?

08:15.391 --> 08:17.911
Yeah, and I'm kind of
stretched tight as it is,

08:17.935 --> 08:19.412
you know, financially speaking.

08:19.436 --> 08:20.747
So you're going to
look for a new place?

08:20.771 --> 08:23.699
Well, actually, I'd like to
talk to you about a raise.

08:25.067 --> 08:26.493
A raise.

08:27.444 --> 08:28.755
Huh.

08:28.779 --> 08:31.206
Yeah, I was thinking
maybe $50 a week.

08:32.698 --> 08:34.126
Fifty, huh?

08:34.326 --> 08:36.001
Uh, the thing is, Bill...

08:36.328 --> 08:37.639
The thing is, when
you were hired,

08:37.663 --> 08:40.392
we agreed to the salary
that you're making now,

08:40.416 --> 08:44.479
which is $150 more a month
than the last nanny we had.

08:44.503 --> 08:46.564
Not that you're not worth it. I
mean, you are, you're great.

08:46.588 --> 08:48.765
Owen loves you. We love you.

08:49.258 --> 08:53.279
Um, but the agreement was every
six months, you'd get a bump.

08:53.303 --> 08:54.531
Yeah, and it's only
been three months.

08:54.555 --> 08:55.772
Right, I know.

08:56.265 --> 08:58.275
It's just this rent thing.

08:59.017 --> 09:01.121
I'd just rather not
start messing around

09:01.145 --> 09:02.821
with the understanding
we have, you know?

09:05.190 --> 09:06.543
Hey, you.

09:06.567 --> 09:08.076
Need some help with that?

09:08.152 --> 09:10.203
I'll take over from here.
You relax.

09:12.197 --> 09:13.415
You okay?

09:16.452 --> 09:17.878
Is there something you want?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.306
Of course not. I just thought
I'd help you out. I mean,

09:20.330 --> 09:22.600
- that's what people do when they love each other, right?
-  -Dinner!

09:22.624 --> 09:24.769
Right, so why are you
doing this for me?

09:24.793 --> 09:27.304
You're great.

09:27.546 --> 09:28.481
Hey, you.

09:28.505 --> 09:31.391
Oh, I heard that Bach you were playing.
It sounded great!

09:31.675 --> 09:33.570
- Thanks.
- Dinner!

09:33.594 --> 09:36.281
I just, I think
very highly of you,

09:36.305 --> 09:37.532
and I thought you
should know that.

09:37.556 --> 09:39.659
And if anyone ever tells
you that I don't...

09:39.683 --> 09:41.401
Why would someone tell me that?

09:41.435 --> 09:42.652
No...

09:43.145 --> 09:44.571
No reason.

09:45.564 --> 09:47.625
- Are you joining us?
- Of course!

09:47.649 --> 09:50.753
Family dinner, you bet.
Listen, Charlie, um...

09:50.777 --> 09:52.464
I was just wondering...

09:52.488 --> 09:55.916
Do you happen to know what the
phrase "dramatic license" means?

09:56.325 --> 09:58.428
Broccoli. Blech.

09:58.452 --> 10:01.139
I don't like it. You know I don't like it.
I never liked it.

10:01.163 --> 10:03.131
Try it again. Maybe
you'll like it this time.

10:03.332 --> 10:04.925
What's that supposed to mean?

10:04.958 --> 10:06.936
Parents say that to kids
all the time, and...

10:06.960 --> 10:08.595
It doesn't make any sense.

10:08.795 --> 10:11.941
Why would I suddenly like something
I've hated my whole life?

10:11.965 --> 10:14.068
Did you prepare it so it
wouldn't taste like broccoli?

10:14.092 --> 10:15.570
Are you some kind
of cooking genius?

10:15.594 --> 10:17.312
Has my taste changed overnight?

10:18.972 --> 10:20.398
I don't think so.

10:22.226 --> 10:24.945
We'll sit here until you've
finished eating the broccoli.

10:26.772 --> 10:29.459
I can't believe you would
throw away everything we have

10:29.483 --> 10:31.409
over a stupid plate
of vegetables.

10:33.195 --> 10:34.830
I hate you now. You know that.

10:36.657 --> 10:39.376
I'll probably hate you forever.

10:40.953 --> 10:42.295
Eat.

10:51.255 --> 10:52.848
Don't you dare.

10:53.131 --> 10:54.526
What are you gonna do?
Tackle me?

10:54.550 --> 10:56.402
Throw me into the ground?
Lock me in my room?

10:56.426 --> 10:57.403
Claudia, for God's sakes.

10:57.427 --> 10:59.280
I mean it. I'm warning you.

10:59.304 --> 11:00.573
I'm done with dinner.

11:00.597 --> 11:01.982
Okay, that's it.

11:02.140 --> 11:04.827
No more TV. The set is not going
on, not for a single second

11:04.851 --> 11:06.278
for the rest of the month.

11:07.104 --> 11:08.697
You lose, Claud.

11:14.569 --> 11:16.329
Something's different.

11:16.947 --> 11:18.415
You.

11:19.449 --> 11:20.917
Me?

11:21.326 --> 11:23.128
I'm different?

11:23.412 --> 11:25.130
You kiss differently.

11:26.164 --> 11:27.141
Uh-uh.

11:27.165 --> 11:28.559
Yes, you do.

11:28.583 --> 11:30.103
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

11:30.127 --> 11:32.387
I do not, Kate.

11:32.629 --> 11:34.973
Okay, okay, you don't.

11:35.007 --> 11:36.734
It's okay if you do, though.

11:36.758 --> 11:39.654
I mean, if you kissed someone
else while I was gone.

11:39.678 --> 11:41.896
I mean, three months
is a long time.

11:44.057 --> 11:45.734
Why? Did you...

11:45.934 --> 11:47.360
Kiss someone?

11:48.520 --> 11:50.113
Kyle Engstrom.

11:50.355 --> 11:52.657
He took me to see
<i>Pulp Fiction,</i> and...

11:52.858 --> 11:54.618
We kissed outside my dorm.

11:56.445 --> 11:58.121
Kissed or made out?

11:58.613 --> 12:00.383
Kissed. One kiss.

12:00.407 --> 12:02.250
- Tongues?
- No.

12:02.492 --> 12:04.429
Well, maybe he did a little.

12:04.453 --> 12:07.797
It was just that one time. We're
not seeing each other or anything.

12:09.124 --> 12:10.351
What are you doing?

12:10.375 --> 12:12.719
Kate, are you trying
to make me jealous?

12:13.378 --> 12:14.679
Is that what you're doing?

12:15.922 --> 12:17.432
I'm, uh...

12:17.716 --> 12:20.226
Looking for signs
that we're okay,

12:20.635 --> 12:21.863
'cause, I don't know,

12:21.887 --> 12:24.657
it just feels like we're 10
degrees off or something.

12:24.681 --> 12:26.733
Doesn't it feel that way to you?

12:26.767 --> 12:28.151
No.

12:29.603 --> 12:31.446
Are we okay, Bailey?

12:32.022 --> 12:33.990
'Cause your letters, they...

12:34.358 --> 12:36.951
Started out like
conversations, and...

12:37.277 --> 12:40.080
They ended up like you were writing
to your aunt in Cleveland.

12:40.572 --> 12:43.458
And lots of times on the
phone, you had to go.

12:44.284 --> 12:46.294
And your eyes...

12:46.912 --> 12:50.674
They seem... Are you
sad about something?

13:00.926 --> 13:03.019
Ten degrees off, huh?

13:06.098 --> 13:07.732
We can fix that.

13:18.568 --> 13:22.215
I'm sorry your family isn't
here for the presentation.

13:22.239 --> 13:25.009
Oh, yeah, well, you know...
They're very busy people.

13:25.033 --> 13:27.428
I understand. I mean,
I know they love me.

13:27.452 --> 13:29.263
At least, they
have up until now.

13:29.287 --> 13:31.724
You know, I just got the impression
on the phone this morning...

13:31.748 --> 13:33.133
Julia!

13:34.376 --> 13:35.645
What are you guys doing here?

13:35.669 --> 13:37.814
- Are you kidding me?
- Why didn't you say something?

13:37.838 --> 13:39.982
Do we have to get a phone
call from the magazine?

13:40.006 --> 13:42.527
Oh, you know how private I am.

13:42.551 --> 13:44.112
Jule, this is great.

13:44.136 --> 13:46.730
- I mean, this, this is great.
- Hmm.

13:47.931 --> 13:51.202
Oh, um, well, I guess I
should introduce you guys.

13:51.226 --> 13:52.370
This is Carolyn Prousky.

13:52.394 --> 13:56.207
She's the editor of the magazine. And this is my
brother, Charlie, and this is Kirsten Bennett.

13:56.231 --> 13:57.458
I guess you guys spoke.

13:57.482 --> 14:00.034
This is your oldest brother?

14:01.027 --> 14:02.245
Why?

14:02.946 --> 14:05.258
Well, I guess I should
keep my distance, huh,

14:05.282 --> 14:07.625
I mean, if I know
what's good for me.

14:07.742 --> 14:09.137
- What?
- N... nothing.

14:09.161 --> 14:10.763
Well, it's like Reg...

14:10.787 --> 14:13.433
...stepped right off the page
and walked right into the room.

14:13.457 --> 14:14.758
Reg?

14:15.041 --> 14:16.602
Reg. Did you...

14:16.626 --> 14:18.312
- Did you write about me?
- Well...

14:18.336 --> 14:21.014
You mean you haven't
read the story yet?

14:21.631 --> 14:24.110
Well, I guess Julia thought
that she would surprise you.

14:24.134 --> 14:25.477
No kidding.

14:25.635 --> 14:28.229
Well, here. Take a
look for yourself.

14:28.555 --> 14:30.116
I have to, uh, start
the proceedings.

14:30.140 --> 14:32.525
Would you excuse me, please?

14:33.018 --> 14:34.078
Charlie, don't.

14:34.102 --> 14:35.788
Why not? This is so exciting.

14:35.812 --> 14:38.740
Well, I'm embarrassed. Come on.

14:39.441 --> 14:40.918
Uh, please, give it back.
I mean it.

14:40.942 --> 14:43.588
No way. Reg, huh?
Listen to this:

14:43.612 --> 14:45.047
"A three-day growth of beard,

14:45.071 --> 14:47.925
a paint-stained shirt, rough
hands, they all worked for him.

14:47.949 --> 14:51.211
It was as if he did not need
words to speak to women."

14:52.621 --> 14:55.465
Wow. That is very well written.

14:55.707 --> 14:57.467
- You're welcome.
- Hey.

14:57.542 --> 15:00.637
You'll just be impossible to
live with if you read any more.

15:02.005 --> 15:04.057
- They sound amazing.
- Don't they?

15:04.299 --> 15:06.027
Will and I heard them at
this club in Berkeley.

15:06.051 --> 15:07.320
They don't even have
an album out yet.

15:07.344 --> 15:09.530
This is a bootleg, from
one of their concerts.

15:09.554 --> 15:11.616
They sound just like
this band from NYU,

15:11.640 --> 15:14.692
that plays weekends at this club
I go to in the city sometimes.

15:15.101 --> 15:16.277
Really?

15:16.311 --> 15:17.987
Know what we've got to do?

15:18.647 --> 15:20.698
We've definitely got to do this.

15:20.732 --> 15:23.795
You tell Charlie that you've got
to come east to look at colleges.

15:23.819 --> 15:25.087
We save up money,

15:25.111 --> 15:28.090
don't ask me how. Well, you
take off a Friday and a Monday,

15:28.114 --> 15:31.751
and we spend an entire
weekend in New York.

15:32.327 --> 15:33.586
That sounds good.

15:35.622 --> 15:37.173
Oh, God, I gotta go.

15:37.207 --> 15:38.800
I promised my Dad.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.219
- Tonight?
- Uh-huh.

15:41.253 --> 15:42.679
I knew this would happen.

15:44.047 --> 15:45.348
I mean...

15:46.508 --> 15:48.184
I really hoped it would happen.

15:49.010 --> 15:51.938
You seem much more
like yourself today.

15:52.514 --> 15:54.440
I was actually afraid to...

15:55.308 --> 15:57.036
Come back and see you.

15:57.060 --> 15:58.820
That's silly, huh?

15:59.646 --> 16:01.156
Kate...

16:02.065 --> 16:03.491
Tonight.

16:06.653 --> 16:08.621
Why bother waiting until
we hit the slopes?

16:08.738 --> 16:12.667
Why don't I just hurl myself off the
front porch and break my leg now?

16:14.160 --> 16:16.379
- Kate! Hi!
- Hi.

16:16.705 --> 16:19.048
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

16:19.165 --> 16:20.768
You're not leaving
right this sec?

16:20.792 --> 16:22.895
Yeah. Dinner at Square One
with my dad and my stepmom.

16:22.919 --> 16:26.014
But Bailey and I are gonna meet up
later if you guys want to come.

16:26.172 --> 16:28.734
Okay, 'cause I'm just
gonna be so late.

16:28.758 --> 16:31.227
Okay, see ya. Nice to
have her back, huh?

16:32.053 --> 16:33.438
Where's Owen?

16:33.471 --> 16:35.741
Bill took him with
him down to the...

16:35.765 --> 16:36.909
Department of Housing
or something.

16:36.933 --> 16:39.194
He had to see if this rent
hike of his was legal.

16:40.061 --> 16:41.330
Well, my landlord in Berkeley

16:41.354 --> 16:42.832
was always pulling
stuff like that.

16:42.856 --> 16:45.334
He's only asking for 50
bucks a week, Charlie.

16:45.358 --> 16:46.335
I mean, that's nothing.

16:46.359 --> 16:47.577
It's not nothing.

16:47.736 --> 16:50.131
It's $2400 a year, which
is diapers and groceries,

16:50.155 --> 16:53.041
and violin lessons, and
your car insurance and...

16:53.909 --> 16:55.595
Look, I don't need to
explain this to you.

16:55.619 --> 16:57.763
Bill and I agreed he'd get
a raise every six months.

16:57.787 --> 17:01.132
It hasn't been six months. When it is,
he'll get one. That was the deal.

17:02.292 --> 17:03.509
Say, Kirsten,

17:03.668 --> 17:05.354
just out of curiosity,
how much are, uh...

17:05.377 --> 17:07.180
How much are lift
tickets these days?

17:08.214 --> 17:09.473
What? Uh...

17:10.550 --> 17:12.101
I don't know. Well...

17:12.344 --> 17:13.603
Forty bucks?

17:14.262 --> 17:18.451
Which means that, uh,
that between a hotel room

17:18.474 --> 17:22.121
and ski boots and what it costs to get
hauled up a stupid mountain, you two

17:22.145 --> 17:24.113
are gonna blow enough
money in four days

17:24.230 --> 17:26.375
to pay for three months of Bill.

17:26.398 --> 17:28.868
That's right. We're
gonna blow my money.

17:29.611 --> 17:31.412
You know, Charlie,
we don't have to.

17:31.863 --> 17:34.249
- I mean, go skiing.
- We are going skiing.

17:35.075 --> 17:36.636
This is my money, Bailey,

17:36.660 --> 17:38.471
not your money, not
the family's money.

17:38.495 --> 17:40.264
Money I earned walking
away from a job

17:40.288 --> 17:41.766
that none of you
wanted me to take.

17:41.790 --> 17:45.176
And I can spend it any way I damn well
please without having to answer to you.

17:51.091 --> 17:52.433
Julia!

17:54.344 --> 17:55.603
Julia!

17:57.013 --> 17:58.314
Julia!

18:01.267 --> 18:03.194
- Julia.
- God, do you mind?

18:04.354 --> 18:05.623
Where did you find that?

18:05.647 --> 18:07.073
Not the issue.

18:07.148 --> 18:08.918
"Watching her play sometimes,
it seemed that she was

18:08.942 --> 18:10.962
less a little girl
than a machine."

18:10.986 --> 18:12.296
I can definitely explain.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.965
"Hour upon hour, she
would practice,

18:13.989 --> 18:17.218
not moving, the music repeating
again and again without variation,

18:17.242 --> 18:19.679
without a hint that a human
heart beat inside the body

18:19.703 --> 18:21.838
that moved the bow that
touched her strings"?

18:22.497 --> 18:24.549
First of all, that's
way overwritten.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.593
Claud, this isn't even about you.
I mean...

18:27.711 --> 18:29.689
Well, I changed lots of things.

18:29.713 --> 18:31.232
This, this girl doesn't
even play the violin.

18:31.256 --> 18:32.566
No. The viola!

18:32.590 --> 18:35.027
Wow, you'd have to be Sherlock
Holmes to figure that one out.

18:35.051 --> 18:35.987
What the hell's going on?

18:36.011 --> 18:38.739
Claud, it's just a story. I mean,
it really isn't meant to be you.

18:38.763 --> 18:39.740
You wrote about Claudia?

18:39.764 --> 18:42.817
I was publicly humiliated
in a regional magazine.

18:43.059 --> 18:44.328
Oh, very funny.

18:44.352 --> 18:46.998
Let's see who's laughing
after you read page 134.

18:47.022 --> 18:48.323
Bailey, don't.

18:48.565 --> 18:50.283
I want a public retraction.

18:50.942 --> 18:52.044
What?

18:52.068 --> 18:53.004
I can explain.

18:53.028 --> 18:54.839
"Sex drive with legs"?

18:54.863 --> 18:56.966
He moved through life
as if the only thought

18:56.990 --> 18:58.968
that coursed through
his brain was, 'do it.

18:58.992 --> 19:01.669
Do it, find someone
and finally do it.'"

19:02.162 --> 19:04.005
Wow, is that overwritten.

19:04.205 --> 19:06.674
Bailey, this really doesn't mean anything.
I mean, you take

19:06.708 --> 19:08.769
one little character thing
and you blow it up,

19:08.793 --> 19:10.396
you know, out of proportion,
to make a good story.

19:10.420 --> 19:11.637
I mean, this is...

19:11.921 --> 19:14.724
Not how I feel about you
guys, and I really,

19:15.133 --> 19:18.394
a lot, respect you, and you've gotta
promise me not to tell Charlie.

19:18.845 --> 19:20.313
Charlie's in here too?

19:20.388 --> 19:22.231
Please, don't tell him.

19:27.729 --> 19:29.030
For a price.

19:33.693 --> 19:35.161
What do you think you're doing?

19:35.195 --> 19:37.205
Watching <i>A Song to Remember.</i>

19:37.405 --> 19:39.916
Apparently, you didn't understand
what I said last night.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.718
Claudia, shut off the damn TV.

19:51.002 --> 19:53.773
This is practically my favorite
movie, and it's, like, never on.

19:53.797 --> 19:55.107
Well, you should
have thought of that

19:55.131 --> 19:56.942
before you didn't eat
your broccoli last night.

19:56.966 --> 19:58.935
I don't care. I'm watching it.

19:59.677 --> 20:01.781
You listen to me, and
you listen good.

20:01.805 --> 20:03.866
You do not make the rules
around here. I do.

20:03.890 --> 20:06.317
We've read about civil
disobedience in school,

20:06.976 --> 20:09.487
about oppressed people
standing up to tyrants.

20:09.562 --> 20:12.374
I am not a tyrant, and
you are not oppressed.

20:12.398 --> 20:13.542
I am an adult...

20:13.566 --> 20:15.753
...and you are 12 years old. I'm
allowed to tell you what to eat,

20:15.777 --> 20:18.746
and what to watch on TV,
and when to go to bed!

20:20.281 --> 20:21.958
That's it.

20:27.705 --> 20:30.258
Claudia, go to your tent.

20:33.128 --> 20:34.929
Let's see...

20:35.088 --> 20:37.432
Uh, regular coffee, please.

20:37.507 --> 20:39.652
Hey, there. Guess who.

20:39.676 --> 20:41.227
Hey, K...

20:44.722 --> 20:46.065
Jill.

20:46.975 --> 20:48.359
Good guess.

20:54.983 --> 20:56.325
Say something.

20:57.110 --> 20:58.420
Anything.

20:58.444 --> 20:59.871
What do you want
me to say, Jill?

21:00.947 --> 21:02.832
I guess you're still mad at me.

21:03.074 --> 21:04.250
Really?

21:04.576 --> 21:06.169
You think so? I don't know.

21:06.828 --> 21:09.380
I've only spent the last month
thinking that you were maybe...

21:09.581 --> 21:11.299
In a ditch somewhere.

21:11.666 --> 21:13.050
I thought you were dead.

21:14.127 --> 21:16.637
No, not dead.

21:18.214 --> 21:19.849
I spent about a week just...

21:20.592 --> 21:22.027
Going around in circles...

21:22.051 --> 21:24.770
Gilroy, Fresno, Monterey...

21:25.513 --> 21:27.658
Just hitching rides anywhere,

21:27.682 --> 21:29.368
because these truckers,
lots of them,

21:29.392 --> 21:32.195
they take stuff to stay
awake on the road.

21:32.687 --> 21:34.155
They'd give me some.

21:34.939 --> 21:37.742
They'd buy me hamburgers, and
they'd let me crash in the back.

21:38.693 --> 21:41.422
I hitched this ride with
this one guy who was, uh...

21:41.446 --> 21:43.924
...driving artichokes
down to San Diego,

21:43.948 --> 21:46.844
and somewhere around
Santa Barbara,

21:46.868 --> 21:49.003
he put his hand on my leg.

21:50.038 --> 21:51.756
Hardly even noticed at first.

21:53.041 --> 21:54.351
I was just thinking,

21:54.375 --> 21:56.187
"Maybe he'll give me some money

21:56.211 --> 21:59.639
so I can buy some stuff, some
speed, when I get down to LA."

22:01.132 --> 22:04.435
And then his hand started
moving up my thigh,

22:05.553 --> 22:08.314
and I was just, looking at it,

22:09.015 --> 22:10.274
thinking...

22:11.935 --> 22:13.736
"Why can't I feel this?"

22:16.856 --> 22:18.658
Suddenly, I knew...

22:19.734 --> 22:23.204
If I made it down there,
I'd never come back.

22:25.365 --> 22:26.874
I'd never see you again.

22:30.203 --> 22:31.796
That scared me, Bailey.

22:34.290 --> 22:36.467
It scared me so bad that...

22:36.709 --> 22:38.604
I ditched this guy at
the next truck stop,

22:38.628 --> 22:42.056
and I ran across the highway,
and I hitched a ride back home.

22:45.677 --> 22:49.605
I am three weeks into a rehab
program at my Mom's hospital.

22:52.308 --> 22:53.651
I'm clean.

22:56.729 --> 22:59.115
I didn't want to see you
till I could say that.

23:02.318 --> 23:03.796
Hi! How's it going?

23:03.820 --> 23:05.288
Say something.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.707
I'm glad you're okay.

23:10.326 --> 23:11.544
That's it?

23:13.997 --> 23:15.298
Bailey...

23:15.373 --> 23:16.549
I got to go.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.342
What?

23:25.091 --> 23:26.475
I got to go.

23:35.727 --> 23:37.778
I swear I am going to kill her.

23:38.271 --> 23:40.708
Inhale...

23:40.732 --> 23:42.292
Exhale.

23:42.316 --> 23:43.617
Attaboy.

23:43.735 --> 23:45.170
I'm just going to
tiptoe downstairs

23:45.194 --> 23:47.163
and put poison in
her Corn Puffs.

23:48.197 --> 23:49.415
Hey.

23:50.241 --> 23:52.886
I just remembered, I'm supposed
to watch that penguin special

23:52.910 --> 23:54.430
on the Discovery Channel.

23:54.454 --> 23:55.514
How about knocking, huh?

23:55.538 --> 23:57.882
So you're gonna have
to put the TV back in.

23:59.959 --> 24:01.177
No go, Claudia.

24:01.544 --> 24:02.887
It's for school.

24:03.129 --> 24:05.765
Forget it, Claudia. When
I say no, I mean no.

24:05.798 --> 24:08.068
And since you seem to have trouble
understanding this concept,

24:08.092 --> 24:11.354
maybe you'll understand
this one: you are grounded.

24:11.846 --> 24:14.450
- What? -For the next week,
you're not leaving this house

24:14.474 --> 24:17.327
for anything except for school
and violin lessons. That's it.

24:17.351 --> 24:18.287
No going to Artie's house,

24:18.311 --> 24:21.947
no hanging out at Salinger's, no Saturday
matinees... You're not going anywhere.

24:28.905 --> 24:32.333
I'm getting an ulcer.

24:37.997 --> 24:40.851
Oh, I ran into Jennifer
Mitchell on Polk.

24:40.875 --> 24:42.593
You didn't tell me she
and Peter broke up.

24:44.170 --> 24:46.690
Oh, I didn't? Yeah,
I guess they did.

24:46.714 --> 24:48.432
She seems really bummed.

24:48.549 --> 24:50.476
And she asked me if
she gained weight...

24:51.302 --> 24:53.739
And she did gain
weight, and I said no,

24:53.763 --> 24:56.440
but, man, she was, like...

24:58.101 --> 25:00.611
Oh, God, they were
together forever.

25:02.313 --> 25:03.499
Are you listening?

25:03.523 --> 25:05.825
Yeah. Sure I am.

25:07.527 --> 25:09.870
You jiggled your leg
through the whole movie.

25:09.904 --> 25:11.705
Yeah, well, it was stupid.

25:12.573 --> 25:14.375
I mean, nothing ever
happens like that.

25:14.492 --> 25:15.594
Like, all their
problems are solved

25:15.618 --> 25:18.388
because their eyes meet
across some subway platform.

25:18.412 --> 25:20.172
That's supposed to be realistic?
Come on.

25:23.209 --> 25:24.760
So who's that girl?

25:25.837 --> 25:27.054
What girl?

25:27.755 --> 25:29.807
That girl, the one
in the coffee house.

25:31.134 --> 25:33.394
The blond one, the one
you were talking to?

25:34.053 --> 25:35.479
Oh, you mean Jill.

25:36.264 --> 25:38.774
She's just... She's just a girl.

25:39.976 --> 25:41.861
You guys have a class
together or something?

25:42.520 --> 25:43.779
Yeah.

25:44.981 --> 25:46.240
Yeah.

25:47.191 --> 25:48.617
What flavor did you get?

25:51.612 --> 25:52.830
Hmm.

25:56.993 --> 25:58.178
When you're done with
Bailey's closet,

25:58.202 --> 26:00.430
I'd like to have my
CDs alphabetized.

26:00.454 --> 26:01.932
Now, would you like
those all together,

26:01.956 --> 26:04.017
or separated according
to type of music?

26:04.041 --> 26:07.845
Oh, hey, that's a nice idea.
Do that.

26:08.087 --> 26:10.190
And, uh, could you
scrub these clean

26:10.214 --> 26:11.900
with a washcloth
and a little soap?

26:11.924 --> 26:13.851
You want me to clean
your sneakers by hand?

26:14.927 --> 26:16.604
You hate clean sneakers.

26:16.971 --> 26:18.198
Not anymore.

26:18.222 --> 26:23.194
Claudia, I said I was sorry. I said
it over and over. Isn't that enough?

26:23.728 --> 26:24.945
No.

26:26.522 --> 26:28.417
Oh, and, uh...

26:28.441 --> 26:30.868
Thurber pooped a couple
times on the lawn.

26:31.277 --> 26:33.996
I wouldn't say anything, but
since it's rained, it's...

26:34.363 --> 26:36.165
Getting kind of gross.

26:44.582 --> 26:45.976
Uh, Owen's down for the count.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.227
I'm gonna take off,
if that's okay.

26:47.251 --> 26:48.552
Sure.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.347
- Uh, Bill?
- Hmm?

26:54.634 --> 26:57.645
We were playing cowboys and Indi...
Uh, Native Americans.

26:58.179 --> 27:00.940
Politically correct, but doesn't
have the same ring to it, does it?

27:05.228 --> 27:07.905
So, uh, whatever happened
to that rent hike, huh?

27:07.980 --> 27:10.199
Oh, yeah, that. Uh...

27:10.524 --> 27:11.877
Nothing to be done. It's...

27:11.901 --> 27:13.629
It's not a rent-controlled
building.

27:13.653 --> 27:15.746
So basically, I'm screwed.

27:16.197 --> 27:18.800
Anyway, forget it.
It's not your problem.

27:18.824 --> 27:20.052
I'll see you in
the morning, huh?

27:20.076 --> 27:21.502
Hey, man, wait a second.

27:22.203 --> 27:25.005
Uh, you need a
raise, you got it.

27:25.414 --> 27:26.674
What?

27:27.750 --> 27:29.686
Really? Because when I
talked to Charlie...

27:29.710 --> 27:31.730
We all know how lucky
we are to have you,

27:31.754 --> 27:33.440
and it would be really
stupid for us to lose you

27:33.464 --> 27:37.309
over a lousy 50 bucks a week, right?
So...

27:37.969 --> 27:39.905
Wow, man, that's, that's great.

27:39.929 --> 27:41.531
Thanks a lot. That really helps.

27:41.555 --> 27:43.440
You don't know how
much that helps.

27:45.518 --> 27:47.069
See you.

27:47.144 --> 27:48.862
I'm just thinking.

27:48.980 --> 27:51.073
A four-day weekend,
that's not enough time.

27:51.232 --> 27:53.826
Day three, you're already
thinking about coming home.

27:54.277 --> 27:56.662
I need to get away.
I need to unwind.

27:57.530 --> 27:59.925
Need to get Claudia's miserable
little voice out of my head.

27:59.949 --> 28:01.625
- Hmm.
- I need a week.

28:01.909 --> 28:04.003
I definitely sympathize.

28:05.413 --> 28:06.839
Where did you get that?

28:07.206 --> 28:09.518
I was looking all over the house.
I couldn't find a single copy.

28:09.542 --> 28:10.727
Newsstand.

28:10.751 --> 28:12.595
I'll leave it for
you when I'm done.

28:12.753 --> 28:14.221
What about Europe, huh?

28:14.714 --> 28:16.098
What if we really took a trip?

28:16.257 --> 28:17.683
Italy or something.

28:19.135 --> 28:20.519
Have you ever been?

28:22.513 --> 28:23.689
Kirsten?

28:24.056 --> 28:25.482
I'm sorry. What?

28:26.475 --> 28:28.110
That good, huh? Julia's story?

28:29.353 --> 28:31.905
Uh... Amazing.

28:32.356 --> 28:33.709
Let me see it. Come on.

28:33.733 --> 28:35.659
- I want to read about Reg.
- You don't, really.

28:35.693 --> 28:38.422
Yes, I do. It's about me.
I'm fascinated.

28:38.446 --> 28:39.506
- No.
- Give it here.

28:39.530 --> 28:41.675
It's like... It's, it's...

28:41.699 --> 28:43.751
It's silly. It's women's stuff,

28:44.744 --> 28:47.671
very touchy-feely. Trust me,
You wouldn't be interested.

28:49.498 --> 28:50.966
What's this about Italy?

28:51.584 --> 28:53.636
You're gonna tell me
to forget it, right?

28:53.836 --> 28:55.930
You're gonna say,
"What about the kids?

28:56.464 --> 28:59.224
"Who's gonna take care of them?
What if something happens?"

28:59.759 --> 29:01.060
You're gonna say no.

29:01.177 --> 29:02.478
Actually...

29:04.805 --> 29:07.117
Actually, let them manage
on their own for a while.

29:07.141 --> 29:08.484
I think we should get away.

29:09.644 --> 29:12.655
Wow... That's a switch.

29:12.938 --> 29:16.001
A new irresponsible you.
I like it.

29:16.025 --> 29:17.368
Hmm.

29:18.402 --> 29:20.464
Charlie, what are you... Don't.
Don't.

29:20.488 --> 29:21.747
Why?

29:23.407 --> 29:24.750
Just don't.

29:41.384 --> 29:42.977
Kind of wild downstairs, huh?

29:44.970 --> 29:47.773
Claudia, she's... She's
having a slumber party thing.

29:49.392 --> 29:50.985
You didn't call me all day.

29:54.397 --> 29:58.033
Boy, it just must have killed
you when I ran away, huh?

29:59.110 --> 30:00.953
I mean, you must have
been devastated.

30:02.405 --> 30:03.706
Obviously.

30:04.740 --> 30:07.251
So tell me, how long did it
take you to meet someone else?

30:07.451 --> 30:10.671
Hmm? Two days? Three days?

30:10.830 --> 30:12.297
- A whole week?
- That was Kate.

30:16.919 --> 30:18.637
Kate. Right.

30:22.049 --> 30:23.318
She seemed nice.

30:23.342 --> 30:24.518
She is nice.

30:26.804 --> 30:29.356
And, and honest.

30:30.015 --> 30:32.786
And fun, and easy to be with.

30:32.810 --> 30:34.079
Oh, up yours, okay?

30:34.103 --> 30:37.156
What are you doing here, Jill?
Huh?

30:37.273 --> 30:39.158
How many chances do
you think you get?

30:39.650 --> 30:40.993
I don't know. I...

30:42.403 --> 30:43.912
I guess I need one more.

30:44.321 --> 30:46.081
What? Are you kidding me?

30:47.241 --> 30:50.502
What do you think? You think you could
just ditch me whenever you want?

30:51.203 --> 30:52.097
Huh?

30:52.121 --> 30:53.338
And lie to me,

30:53.456 --> 30:55.016
and make me, make me
worry all the time

30:55.040 --> 30:56.518
because you might
be dead somewhere,

30:56.542 --> 30:59.470
and then you come back to me.
You say, "Please, help me,

30:59.628 --> 31:01.106
please help me. I can't
do this without you."

31:01.130 --> 31:02.765
And what am I supposed to do?

31:03.883 --> 31:05.517
I can't say no to you.

31:06.552 --> 31:07.895
But...

31:08.637 --> 31:10.615
But I can't keep saying
yes, because then

31:10.639 --> 31:13.108
I'll never get out of this, and
I don't want this anymore.

31:13.684 --> 31:14.953
Okay? I don't.

31:14.977 --> 31:17.748
I want things to be
simple and easy,

31:17.772 --> 31:20.083
and I don't want you
coming back into my life

31:20.107 --> 31:23.003
and making me scared all the time,
and making me feel guilty, okay?

31:23.027 --> 31:24.703
I don't want it. I'm sick of it.

31:28.616 --> 31:29.917
I don't want it.

31:35.998 --> 31:37.341
Okay.

31:43.506 --> 31:44.723
Jill...

31:46.425 --> 31:49.696
- Eighty-four! Eighty-five! Eighty-six...
- Julia! Julia!

31:49.720 --> 31:51.406
Eighty-seven, eighty-eight...

31:51.430 --> 31:52.699
Eighty-nine...

31:52.723 --> 31:55.952
Claudia! Claudia,
what is going on?

31:55.976 --> 31:57.621
- Have you lost your mind?
- No.

31:57.645 --> 31:58.830
I told you...

31:58.854 --> 32:01.458
You told me that I was grounded,
that I couldn't go out.

32:01.482 --> 32:04.628
Well, I didn't go out.
I brought everyone in.

32:04.652 --> 32:07.881
So actually, technically, you're...
Ow! Charlie, ow!

32:07.905 --> 32:08.924
- You're hurting me!
- You are not

32:08.948 --> 32:11.134
doing this to me anymore.
Have you got that?

32:11.158 --> 32:12.427
When I tell you to do something,

32:12.451 --> 32:15.096
you say, "Yes, Charlie. Thank
you, Charlie," and you do it!

32:15.120 --> 32:17.182
You obey me and you
treat me with respect,

32:17.206 --> 32:18.715
- or I swear to God...
- What?

32:18.749 --> 32:20.936
What are you gonna do? What are
you gonna take away from me next?

32:20.960 --> 32:22.270
That is not what's going on!

32:22.294 --> 32:24.564
And in front of all my friends?
Forget it!

32:24.588 --> 32:26.274
Why do you get to
boss me around?

32:26.298 --> 32:27.234
Cut it out, Claudia!

32:27.258 --> 32:29.194
- You never listen to anyone!
- I don't want to hear this.

32:29.218 --> 32:31.404
- Why should I listen to you? -Because
I'm the father around here now!

32:31.428 --> 32:33.272
- I don't care!
- God...

32:43.816 --> 32:45.033
Some father.

32:45.651 --> 32:47.035
Claudia...

33:02.167 --> 33:04.178
Wow, did you get a load
of the mess downstairs?

33:05.212 --> 33:06.638
Charlie?

33:16.348 --> 33:17.649
I'm sorry.

33:18.851 --> 33:20.569
Charlie, I'm sorry.

33:21.687 --> 33:24.374
I never meant for
you to read it.

33:24.398 --> 33:27.534
And I never meant for
it to be published,

33:28.736 --> 33:31.506
and it's really not
meant to be about you.

33:31.530 --> 33:32.674
I swear it isn't.

33:32.698 --> 33:35.667
Right. Sure.

33:36.493 --> 33:38.921
The guy works in a club,
not in a restaurant.

33:39.079 --> 33:41.381
He's 23, not 24.

33:42.082 --> 33:43.508
He's nothing like me.

33:43.667 --> 33:44.968
He's not.

33:45.419 --> 33:47.763
That's bull, Julia,
and you know it.

33:49.089 --> 33:51.943
Okay, well, maybe I
started with some stuff

33:51.967 --> 33:53.810
that was a little about you,

33:54.553 --> 33:55.864
but I exaggerated.

33:55.888 --> 33:58.982
I mean, I made it worse than it is.
Much...

33:59.516 --> 34:01.077
...worse, and I didn't mean...

34:01.101 --> 34:03.820
That Seattle thing didn't
work out because of you guys,

34:04.229 --> 34:07.834
not because I blew it off, not
because I can't focus on anything.

34:07.858 --> 34:11.161
Right. You gave that up for us.

34:11.195 --> 34:12.839
It wasn't your fault at all.

34:12.862 --> 34:14.424
And I don't screw
around anymore.

34:14.447 --> 34:16.217
I mean, I haven't,
not for a long time.

34:16.241 --> 34:18.627
I'm living with Kirsten.
I love her.

34:19.370 --> 34:22.339
I don't care about
just getting laid.

34:23.706 --> 34:25.217
I know that.

34:25.501 --> 34:27.552
I know, Charlie.

34:28.670 --> 34:32.349
Please, don't be mad at me.
I mean, it's fiction.

34:33.801 --> 34:36.143
This is not how I feel
about you at all.

34:36.971 --> 34:38.188
Right.

34:39.556 --> 34:41.525
Of course it's not.

34:46.271 --> 34:48.824
- You sure you got your tickets?
- Got it.

34:49.108 --> 34:51.252
- Chewing gum?
- Check.

34:51.275 --> 34:53.954
- Something to read?
<i>- The Odyssey.</i>

34:54.029 --> 34:56.623
I'm all set, Bailey. You don't
need to worry about me.

34:57.157 --> 34:59.501
I mean that. You
don't need to worry.

34:59.868 --> 35:02.004
I'm not as fragile
as you think I am.

35:03.580 --> 35:06.476
I was thinking... I
was thinking that

35:06.500 --> 35:09.553
writing to each other every
day is a lot of work.

35:10.129 --> 35:11.523
So maybe...

35:11.547 --> 35:13.608
We should say we'll write
when the spirit moves us,

35:13.632 --> 35:16.111
when we have something really
important to say to each other.

35:16.135 --> 35:18.228
- Same with phone calls.
- Really?

35:18.554 --> 35:20.605
That's what you want?

35:23.100 --> 35:24.484
And...

35:25.102 --> 35:27.612
This guy, Kyle Engstrom,

35:29.440 --> 35:31.199
he really likes me a lot.

35:32.151 --> 35:33.878
I think when I get back to
school, I'm going to tell him

35:33.902 --> 35:35.871
we could go see a
movie or something.

35:36.071 --> 35:38.123
I think that would be a
good idea, don't you?

35:46.123 --> 35:48.342
Yeah, maybe.

35:48.625 --> 35:50.302
If he's a nice guy.

35:51.545 --> 35:53.138
Is he a nice guy?

35:55.174 --> 35:58.352
Yeah. I think so. Very nice.

36:00.888 --> 36:02.481
Well, okay, then.

36:03.390 --> 36:05.233
I want you to be happy, Bailey.

36:07.186 --> 36:08.653
I want you to be happy, too.

36:25.579 --> 36:27.255
Would you do me a favor?

36:28.999 --> 36:31.144
Just... wait a while
before you let me know

36:31.168 --> 36:34.137
you've met someone else, okay?

36:37.758 --> 36:39.059
Okay.

36:47.518 --> 36:49.069
I'm eating an apple.

36:49.353 --> 36:52.364
- Yeah? Good for you.
- It's really delicious.

36:53.065 --> 36:54.491
I'm really enjoying it.

36:55.067 --> 36:57.619
Did you know apples are really
good from a dental standpoint?

36:57.861 --> 36:59.329
We learned that in school.

37:00.531 --> 37:02.666
If you can't brush
for some reason,

37:02.991 --> 37:04.209
eat an apple.

37:04.952 --> 37:07.295
I'm gonna be eating lots
of them from now on.

37:07.412 --> 37:08.797
Broccoli too.

37:09.123 --> 37:10.549
Have you seen the checkbook?

37:10.999 --> 37:13.677
- I'm sorry, Charlie. -Yeah?
Well, help me look for it.

37:14.128 --> 37:17.139
I mean, I'm sorry about before.

37:17.548 --> 37:19.433
You know, about the sleepover.

37:22.010 --> 37:23.979
For making you so mad.

37:24.429 --> 37:26.606
I didn't know it'd
make you that mad.

37:28.350 --> 37:30.735
- You almost hit me. -I don't
want to talk about that, okay?

37:31.103 --> 37:32.320
- But you...
- Okay?

37:33.772 --> 37:35.365
Hey, guys. We're off.

37:35.858 --> 37:38.785
Hey, man. Have you, uh,
seen the checkbook?

37:39.695 --> 37:41.538
Oh, I meant to say thanks.

37:41.572 --> 37:43.508
- For coming through with the raise.
- What?

37:43.532 --> 37:46.553
And I promise you, I won't be hitting
you up for another one for a while.

37:46.577 --> 37:47.679
I'm just glad you
thought about it

37:47.703 --> 37:49.347
and decided you guys
could swing it.

37:49.371 --> 37:51.923
It really helps out a lot.
So thanks.

37:51.957 --> 37:54.134
Mmm-hmm. Sure.

37:54.209 --> 37:56.136
Okay, well, we're
off to the park.

38:00.883 --> 38:02.184
Bailey!

38:03.677 --> 38:04.978
Bailey!

38:12.978 --> 38:14.279
Where's Kate?

38:16.148 --> 38:19.576
She's on a plane. Going
back to Connecticut.

38:19.860 --> 38:22.162
Oh. I get it.

38:23.697 --> 38:26.333
No. No, you don't.

38:28.785 --> 38:30.003
What?

38:37.085 --> 38:40.690
The thing is, I've always been
smart about stuff, you know?

38:40.714 --> 38:43.099
I mean, not stupid.

38:45.385 --> 38:47.521
Look, I don't know
what's happening to me.

38:48.180 --> 38:51.066
- What are you talking about?
- Well, it's like...

38:52.142 --> 38:53.985
It's like I'm not in control.

38:54.561 --> 38:58.323
You know, I... I... I
want to do one thing...

38:59.483 --> 39:01.076
You know, I plan...

39:01.610 --> 39:03.995
To do one thing, and...

39:04.112 --> 39:05.956
I end up doing something else.

39:09.910 --> 39:11.419
I love you.

39:12.746 --> 39:14.047
And...

39:15.207 --> 39:16.925
And I don't know why.

39:17.251 --> 39:21.721
And, and I don't think
that I wanna love you.

39:22.047 --> 39:23.807
I think I wanna stop.

39:24.675 --> 39:25.944
I just...

39:25.968 --> 39:29.187
I don't want to
want you so much.

39:32.224 --> 39:33.608
But I do.

39:35.602 --> 39:36.987
Bailey...

39:39.231 --> 39:40.448
I do.

40:40.208 --> 40:42.312
Come on, Julia. You've
been in there forever.

40:42.336 --> 40:43.521
Just a sec!

40:43.545 --> 40:44.856
Claudia, you got it?

40:44.880 --> 40:46.941
I couldn't find <i>Blueberries
for Sal,</i> but...

40:46.965 --> 40:48.600
He likes this one too.

40:49.885 --> 40:52.437
Hey, sweetie. We're just going
to read Owen a bedtime story.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.321
Charlie.

41:02.898 --> 41:04.324
What's with you, man?

41:09.696 --> 41:10.840
Are you okay?

41:10.864 --> 41:12.666
Did something happen?

41:14.076 --> 41:15.335
I just...

41:17.329 --> 41:18.838
I can't do this anymore.

41:18.955 --> 41:20.215
Do what?

41:22.501 --> 41:23.760
What are you talking about?

41:24.378 --> 41:26.137
You gave Bill his raise, huh?

41:26.755 --> 41:28.441
- Even though I told you...
- Yeah.

41:28.465 --> 41:31.184
- Yeah, I just figured... -Well, I
don't want to hear about it, okay?

41:31.635 --> 41:32.936
I'm just...

41:34.971 --> 41:38.858
Bottom line, I am just sick
of being second-guessed.

41:39.518 --> 41:41.736
And I am sick of being undercut,

41:42.312 --> 41:45.031
like it's just assumed
whatever I do is wrong.

41:46.566 --> 41:49.244
Like you never
made a bad choice.

41:51.571 --> 41:52.914
Okay, I'm sorry.

41:53.281 --> 41:54.708
I didn't...

41:55.075 --> 41:57.085
- Look, if that's it...
- No.

41:57.494 --> 41:59.305
That's not it.

41:59.329 --> 42:01.214
That's not even
close to being it.

42:03.708 --> 42:06.646
It's like I don't even have the
authority to make a single decision

42:06.670 --> 42:08.638
and have everyone say, "Okay."

42:09.214 --> 42:11.651
That's the way it's gonna be
because Charlie said so."

42:11.675 --> 42:14.310
- Is this all because
of the sleepover? -No.

42:15.262 --> 42:16.479
It's like...

42:17.264 --> 42:20.525
What's yours is yours, and
what's mine is yours.

42:21.309 --> 42:24.154
I don't have anything
that is just mine.

42:24.813 --> 42:28.209
Not the money that I make,
not the right to take a job.

42:28.233 --> 42:29.951
This is about Seattle.

42:30.068 --> 42:31.879
It's all of it. It's everything.

42:31.903 --> 42:34.205
Everything is a fight.
Nothing's easy.

42:35.198 --> 42:37.125
You won't let me make decisions,

42:37.576 --> 42:39.669
and you won't let me make the rules.
You...

42:41.121 --> 42:43.006
You won't even let
me make mistakes.

42:44.082 --> 42:45.717
And I... I...

42:46.001 --> 42:49.804
I can't keep doing this, and then know
that you don't even appreciate it.

42:51.256 --> 42:52.358
You don't even respect me.

42:52.382 --> 42:54.309
Charlie, I swear we do.

42:56.511 --> 42:58.396
And then I get angry and...

43:00.474 --> 43:02.358
I do things, Claud...

43:03.477 --> 43:04.694
That...

43:05.562 --> 43:06.988
I don't mean to do.

43:08.231 --> 43:10.074
And that really scares me.

43:11.234 --> 43:14.746
I mean, that makes me
think I got to get away.

43:15.655 --> 43:19.417
And not just for a four-day
weekend or a week.

43:19.659 --> 43:21.461
I mean, really away.

43:21.745 --> 43:24.056
'Cause if I ever
actually hit you...

43:24.080 --> 43:25.840
Charlie, you didn't hit me.

43:27.667 --> 43:29.562
- Just forget about it.
- No.

43:29.586 --> 43:30.720
Charlie...

43:32.839 --> 43:35.058
You need me to be a man, but...

43:35.217 --> 43:36.559
You won't let me be one.

43:37.636 --> 43:38.738
And...

43:38.762 --> 43:41.282
I have to have something
that's just mine,

43:41.306 --> 43:45.401
something that I don't have
to fight for... or beg for.

43:46.311 --> 43:48.029
And I...

43:49.064 --> 43:50.865
I can't breathe here anymore.

43:54.736 --> 43:55.954
So...

43:56.738 --> 43:58.414
I'm getting my own place.

44:03.662 --> 44:04.838
I'm moving out.
