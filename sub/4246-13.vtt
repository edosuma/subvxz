WEBVTT

00:01.851 --> 00:04.169
The day I agreed to election rigging

00:04.219 --> 00:06.619
is the day I signed
my death sentence.

00:06.620 --> 00:08.004
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:08.038 --> 00:08.689
It wasn't Hollis.

00:08.690 --> 00:10.823
Someone else paid Becky
to kill the president.

00:10.841 --> 00:12.542
When you release Hollis,
I need you to wait an hour.

00:12.593 --> 00:14.160
I let him go an hour ago.

00:14.178 --> 00:16.012
The minute he's released,
make it look like an accident.

00:16.046 --> 00:18.047
Copy that.

00:18.098 --> 00:19.882
Hold the doors!

00:19.934 --> 00:21.601
Sorry.

00:26.023 --> 00:27.523
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

00:27.558 --> 00:29.008
Hands on your head!

00:29.026 --> 00:30.560
Ho... whoa, the hell is
going on here?!

00:30.611 --> 00:31.978
Hollis Doyle, meet Charlie.

00:32.012 --> 00:34.197
Charlie's here to kill you
unless I kill him first,

00:34.231 --> 00:35.848
but I'm not sure I'm
ready to do that yet.

00:35.866 --> 00:38.051
- What do you want from me?
- It's what Olivia wants.

00:38.085 --> 00:39.352
She wants to protect you,
but first she needs you

00:39.386 --> 00:41.170
to promise her that you
won't take the deal

00:41.205 --> 00:43.139
- they're offering you at justice.
- Oh, hell, that's just posturing.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.891
I wish I could believe you,
but I can't,

00:45.525 --> 00:46.992
which is why
instead of killing Charlie

00:47.010 --> 00:49.495
and assuring your safety,
I'm gonna let him live.

00:49.529 --> 00:51.597
If you keep your mouth shut,
I'll be there to protect you.

00:51.631 --> 00:53.899
If you open it, he trades
your head for a paycheck.

00:53.917 --> 00:55.884
Do I make myself clear?

01:01.541 --> 01:03.408
Ooh.

01:03.443 --> 01:06.228
That's lovely.
Ma'am, can you turn him a bit?

01:06.279 --> 01:08.130
Let's show America
the face of baby...

01:08.164 --> 01:10.165
Oh, he doesn't have
a name yet.

01:10.199 --> 01:11.233
We can't decide.

01:11.267 --> 01:12.734
What about "Wallace"?

01:12.769 --> 01:14.369
Wally?

01:14.420 --> 01:16.004
That's the name of a child
who gets beat up

01:16.038 --> 01:17.422
- on the playground, right?
- It's a family name.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.858
Of a child who gets
beat up on the playground.

01:19.892 --> 01:22.627
Cousin Wally did get beat up a lot.

01:24.613 --> 01:25.830
Jeannine?

01:25.831 --> 01:27.949
Okay, everyone, that was great.

01:27.983 --> 01:30.101
Let's give
the family a little privacy.

01:31.203 --> 01:32.770
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.708
Nurse!

01:40.913 --> 01:42.096
Thank you.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.652
I want to spend time
with my son.

01:48.686 --> 01:50.287
He's right here
anytime you want to see him.

01:50.321 --> 01:52.739
I mean after the divorce.
I want to be clear that

01:52.774 --> 01:54.441
I want to spend time with
our children after the divorce.

01:54.475 --> 01:56.109
What makes you think I will
ever agree to a divorce?

01:56.161 --> 01:57.427
Let's be amiable
about this.

01:57.462 --> 01:59.613
- Amiable? <i>Amiable?</i>
- Mellie.

02:00.564 --> 02:02.198
I married you
for better or for worse,

02:02.232 --> 02:04.100
for richer or for poorer,
till death do us part.

02:04.134 --> 02:06.235
There will be no divorce,
<i>honey.</i>

02:07.904 --> 02:08.955
Do...

02:08.989 --> 02:10.889
Not...

02:10.924 --> 02:12.475
Push...

02:12.509 --> 02:13.726
Me.

02:15.579 --> 02:18.748
Hollis Doyle didn't try
to have Fitz killed?

02:18.782 --> 02:20.183
I almost killed
an innocent man.

02:20.217 --> 02:21.400
You crossed a line.

02:21.435 --> 02:23.102
I know.
I went over the edge.

02:23.137 --> 02:25.221
The power...

02:25.255 --> 02:27.273
It goes to your head,

02:27.324 --> 02:29.625
and it's hard to pull back
sometimes. I'm sorry.

02:29.659 --> 02:31.144
Don't let it happen again,
because next time...

02:31.195 --> 02:34.596
Listen.
There won't be a next time.

02:36.516 --> 02:39.501
David Rosen's not letting
election rigging go.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.019
He's a dog with a bone.

02:41.104 --> 02:43.038
Then we need to be bigger dogs
with bigger bones.

02:43.072 --> 02:44.222
When we were trying
to take down Hollis,

02:44.257 --> 02:45.507
I was so ready
to come clean,

02:45.525 --> 02:47.459
let the whole election
rigging thing come out.

02:47.493 --> 02:49.344
I was ready to do it when it was
going to hurt Hollis.

02:49.362 --> 02:51.646
- And now...
- The only person it would hurt is Fitz.

02:51.681 --> 02:54.249
And, Liv? He wouldn't
survive knowing.

02:54.283 --> 02:57.018
It would change him.
It would break him.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.821
Cyrus, I've got Granger
on my back looking for...

03:01.757 --> 03:02.908
Olivia.

03:02.942 --> 03:05.477
Mr. president.

03:08.381 --> 03:10.549
I'll go handle Granger.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:19.625 --> 03:20.976
Fitz.

03:21.010 --> 03:22.477
- Quiet.
- Mmm.

03:29.149 --> 03:30.867
- I'm marrying Edison.
- No, you're not.

03:30.901 --> 03:33.002
You're married.
I'm getting divorced.

03:33.037 --> 03:35.154
She just had your baby.

03:35.189 --> 03:37.890
They'll crucify you.

03:37.925 --> 03:40.309
She induced, you know.

03:40.361 --> 03:43.229
She thinks I don't know.
Like I don't ask questions.

03:43.247 --> 03:45.915
She had the doctor induce
four weeks before her due date.

03:45.949 --> 03:48.167
She put my son's life at risk
in order to manipulate me.

03:48.201 --> 03:50.770
So even if you marry Edison,
I'm divorcing her.

03:50.788 --> 03:52.872
It'll take some time.

03:52.906 --> 03:54.957
She'll fight me.

03:54.992 --> 03:57.443
It might even take the rest
of my presidency,

03:57.478 --> 03:58.678
but I am getting out...

03:58.712 --> 04:00.446
of this marriage.

04:00.481 --> 04:02.648
And I'm supposed to do what,
wait for you?

04:02.683 --> 04:06.102
This isn't theoretical
anymore, Liv.

04:06.136 --> 04:08.020
It's real.

04:08.055 --> 04:10.773
Say you'll wait for me.

04:10.808 --> 04:13.209
We love each other.

04:13.243 --> 04:15.945
We belong together.

04:15.979 --> 04:18.081
So say it.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.466
Say...

04:21.851 --> 04:24.437
- You'll...
- Oh...

04:24.471 --> 04:27.006
Wait...

04:27.040 --> 04:30.009
For...

04:30.043 --> 04:31.411
Me.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.197
Wait for me, Olivia.

04:38.385 --> 04:41.154
I'll think about it.

04:46.026 --> 04:49.278
sync and corrections by bellows
www.addic7ed.com

04:52.865 --> 04:54.616
But Hollis Doyle is still
going to pay, right?

04:54.667 --> 04:57.285
We're going to make him pay
for blowing up Cytron,

04:57.336 --> 04:58.620
for Jesse,
for ruining my life?

04:58.671 --> 05:00.237
Not our table,
not our station.

05:00.255 --> 05:01.706
We need to focus elsewhere.

05:01.740 --> 05:03.157
On the big question...
if Hollis Doyle didn't

05:03.192 --> 05:04.626
try to kill the president,
then who did?

05:04.677 --> 05:06.210
How did it go with Hollis?

05:06.244 --> 05:07.745
Last time we spoke...

05:07.763 --> 05:10.131
They brought him in for questioning.

05:10.182 --> 05:12.183
For questioning?

05:12.217 --> 05:14.085
- So they didn't...
- Arrest him? No.

05:14.103 --> 05:16.187
But the cell phone...

05:16.221 --> 05:17.639
It was circumstantial evidence.

05:17.690 --> 05:18.973
If they're going to
arrest him,

05:19.024 --> 05:20.424
they'll need something
more damning.

05:20.442 --> 05:22.393
Okay, Becky gave
Huck her bank number.

05:22.427 --> 05:24.145
We use that to establish that
someone other than Hollis Doyle

05:24.196 --> 05:26.447
- wired the money to kill the president.
- We just don't know who.

05:26.482 --> 05:27.649
We have the person's
account number.

05:27.700 --> 05:28.766
There must be
some way to trace it.

05:28.784 --> 05:30.234
It's a needle in a haystack.

05:30.268 --> 05:32.370
- We have Becky's bank account.
- Becky?

05:32.404 --> 05:33.705
The girl who shot Fitz.

05:33.739 --> 05:36.157
It's the same account
Hollis used

05:36.208 --> 05:38.326
when he paid her
for blowing up Cytron.

05:38.377 --> 05:40.878
Ah, so...

05:40.913 --> 05:42.630
There must be
a second payment.

05:42.665 --> 05:44.799
The one where he pays her
for shooting the president.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.884
There is, but Hollis
didn't make it.

05:46.919 --> 05:48.336
Forget the account number.

05:48.387 --> 05:49.787
What about the burner phone
that was in Hollis' office?

05:49.805 --> 05:51.055
Were there any
other numbers on it?

05:51.090 --> 05:52.507
Just the one goes
straight to Becky.

05:52.558 --> 05:53.975
I went to see Hollis
the other day.

05:54.009 --> 05:56.310
Do you know he keeps
a second phone in his office?

05:56.395 --> 05:58.646
Locked it in his desk drawer
the second he laid eyes on me.

05:58.681 --> 06:01.232
It was a cheap little burner
like the drug dealers use.

06:01.266 --> 06:02.633
So we trace the origin
of the burner,

06:02.651 --> 06:04.152
find out who bought it,
and we have our man.

06:04.186 --> 06:05.403
Hollis didn't hire that girl.

06:05.437 --> 06:08.973
So if Hollis didn't
hire her, who did?

06:08.991 --> 06:10.825
You.

06:10.859 --> 06:12.827
How does this work?
Do I pay you half now...

06:12.861 --> 06:15.163
Wire the full amount
as soon as the job's done.

06:15.197 --> 06:16.998
This is the number 
for my bank account.

06:17.032 --> 06:18.983
Use this phone anytime
you need to reach me.

06:19.001 --> 06:21.753
- Do not use any other
phone, understood? - Yes.

06:23.956 --> 06:26.457
Why, when you're trying
to clear your conscience,

06:26.491 --> 06:28.342
do you hire a killer,

06:28.377 --> 06:30.327
when all you had to do was
pick up the phone and confess?

06:30.345 --> 06:31.829
It doesn't make sense to me!

06:31.847 --> 06:33.631
Because confessing
solves nothing!

06:33.665 --> 06:36.851
Confessing tells America

06:36.885 --> 06:38.386
that the country they love

06:38.437 --> 06:40.171
is built on a lie,

06:40.189 --> 06:42.190
that it's a fallacy.

06:49.782 --> 06:51.015
Madame Justice.

06:51.033 --> 06:54.035
You think I care
about my conscience?

06:54.069 --> 06:55.953
Screw my conscience!

06:55.988 --> 06:58.956
I'm trying
to save America's soul!

06:58.991 --> 07:01.042
I'm trying to give America
its country back!

07:01.076 --> 07:02.960
The country they deserve!

07:02.995 --> 07:04.528
A country built on trust,

07:04.546 --> 07:06.047
where a vote actually
means something!

07:06.081 --> 07:07.698
By killing a man?

07:11.036 --> 07:13.721
If I'm already going to hell,
why not?

07:13.756 --> 07:16.758
I know you think I'm crazy
for saying that.

07:16.809 --> 07:20.044
No.
I think you're a coward.

07:20.062 --> 07:23.147
Tomorrow I'll be
officially nominated

07:23.182 --> 07:24.932
to the supreme court.

07:24.983 --> 07:26.934
What am I supposed...

07:28.687 --> 07:29.904
How long do I have?

07:29.938 --> 07:33.758
One year.
Best-case scenario, two.

07:33.792 --> 07:35.660
This isn't about
saving America.

07:35.694 --> 07:37.161
This is about saving
your legacy.

07:37.196 --> 07:40.515
Killing Fitz means you never
have to admit what you did.

07:40.566 --> 07:43.167
It means for
the rest of eternity,

07:43.201 --> 07:44.418
whenever someone
utters your name,

07:44.470 --> 07:46.437
it's with respect and honor.

07:49.274 --> 07:51.175
So turn me in.
Go ahead.

07:51.210 --> 07:53.961
If you're such
a pillar of courage,

07:53.996 --> 07:55.763
march over to justice

07:55.798 --> 07:57.882
and tell them
I shot the president.

07:57.916 --> 08:01.018
Tell them about
the election rigging.

08:01.753 --> 08:03.770
Tell them about everything.
Do it!

08:03.822 --> 08:05.572
Except you can't, can you?

08:07.876 --> 08:10.227
Because, just like me,

08:10.261 --> 08:14.832
you know confessing does
more harm than good.

08:21.022 --> 08:24.041
Chin up, Olivia.

08:24.875 --> 08:27.176
Not like I'm getting away with it.

08:51.485 --> 08:53.786
David Rosen, please.

09:04.068 --> 09:06.318
I have an appointment
with a supreme court justice.

09:06.353 --> 09:07.887
Surely that overrides
your orders

09:07.921 --> 09:09.288
from rent-a-cop base camp.

09:09.322 --> 09:11.007
No visitors, period, end of story.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.475
Can you at least tell me why?

09:20.701 --> 09:23.102
Verna.

09:23.136 --> 09:25.938
I had no idea
you were so sick.

09:25.972 --> 09:27.523
I would have come sooner.

09:29.559 --> 09:31.960
The old lady?
The supreme court justice?

09:31.994 --> 09:33.829
The old lady supreme court justice

09:33.863 --> 09:35.230
tried to kill the president?

09:35.264 --> 09:36.248
Damn.

09:36.282 --> 09:37.699
- Huck!
- Sorry.

09:37.733 --> 09:40.202
- I-is she in custody?
- She's in the hospital, dying.

09:40.236 --> 09:41.569
But they could still
take a statement

09:41.587 --> 09:43.204
- and put the case to rest.
- She's not talking.

09:43.222 --> 09:44.656
It's David Rosen
we have to worry about.

09:44.690 --> 09:46.374
He's still investigating
election rigging.

09:46.408 --> 09:48.477
- We need to find out what he knows.
- I'll case his office.

09:48.511 --> 09:49.811
I'll hit up my sources
at justice.

09:49.845 --> 09:52.013
There is one thing
we already have.

09:52.048 --> 09:54.181
- Bobblehead.
- Bobblehead?

09:54.249 --> 09:56.049
- I thought Bobblehead was dead.
- Bobblehead lives.

09:56.051 --> 09:56.751
What's bobblehead?

09:56.786 --> 09:58.169
I know you just got
your job back, David,

09:58.204 --> 09:59.854
and I wasn't gonna say
anything, I swear.

09:59.889 --> 10:01.389
No, you did the right thing.
Come here.

10:01.424 --> 10:03.158
<i>I know you just got</i>
<i>your job back, David,</i>

10:03.192 --> 10:04.776

to shut it down, but I forgot.

12:31.535 --> 12:33.853
Very sad.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.254
Cyrus...

12:35.289 --> 12:38.024
If Fitz goes public with this
divorce, I will go nuclear,

12:38.058 --> 12:39.409
I will walk out
in front of the press,

12:39.443 --> 12:41.477
and I will explain to them
that my marriage is over

12:41.511 --> 12:42.879
because while I was
pregnant with his child,

12:42.913 --> 12:44.847
my husband was having an
affair with Olivia Pope.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.683
I will leave him, and I will
take his children with me.

12:47.717 --> 12:49.385
I will take every penny
he has in the bank

12:49.420 --> 12:50.870

of political capital

12:50.904 --> 12:52.355

I will court

13:16.678 --> 13:18.796
You know what?
I really can't talk right now.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.548
- I need your help, James.
- Or ever.

13:20.582 --> 13:23.668
I'm done, okay? I quit my job.
I'm doing the dad thing now.

13:23.702 --> 13:25.536
Just forget I ever told you
anything about anything.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.221
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

13:27.239 --> 13:28.689
When a national election is stolen...

13:28.724 --> 13:30.124
the D.O.J. gets
pretty invested.

13:30.159 --> 13:31.542
<i>Just give me</i>

13:31.593 --> 13:33.161

13:33.195 --> 13:34.896
I already gave you
the Cytron card,

13:34.930 --> 13:36.247
and I regret
even doing that,

13:36.281 --> 13:37.465
because every day
I'm in living fear

13:37.499 --> 13:38.766
of somebody showing up at the door

13:38.800 --> 13:40.201
and taking my husband away.

13:40.235 --> 13:41.652
<i>Be happy for me.</i>

13:41.703 --> 13:43.154
<i>This guy could tie Hollis Doyle</i>

<i>He could be my missing link,</i>
<i>my second sh...</i>

13:46.841 --> 13:48.492
<i>...could tie Hollis Doyle</i>
<i>to the explosion.</i>

13:48.526 --> 13:50.994
<i>He could be my missing link,</i>
<i>my second shooter.</i>

13:51.028 --> 13:52.679
You are the chain of custody
for that card.

13:52.714 --> 13:54.781
Without you, without your
testimony, there's nothing.

13:54.815 --> 13:56.717
There's no one to prosecute.
There's no case.

13:56.751 --> 13:58.068
And there is a case here, James.

13:58.102 --> 14:00.671
There's a great, big,
slam-dunk case.

14:01.673 --> 14:02.706
I got something!

14:04.576 --> 14:07.094
So heads-up.
This is happening.

14:07.128 --> 14:08.478
Expect a subpoena today.

14:12.533 --> 14:14.684
<i>(David) Okay,</i>
<i>this is the memory card from Ohio.</i>

14:14.718 --> 14:16.169
<i>So he put it</i>
<i>into the machine,</i>

14:16.203 --> 14:17.887
<i>and if it works the way</i>
<i>James says it will,</i>

14:17.921 --> 14:19.655
<i>we can vote for Reston</i>
<i>all night,</i>

14:19.690 --> 14:21.707
<i>and grant would still win</i>
<i>in the final tally.</i>

14:24.477 --> 14:26.412
<i>So this is</i>
<i>what gave him Ohio.</i>

14:26.446 --> 14:28.514
<i>And Ohio gave him</i>
<i>the presidency.</i>

14:30.483 --> 14:33.035
- We need that memory card.
- Maybe he keeps it at his house.

14:33.069 --> 14:35.254
- He's got a safe in his closet.
- Abby, no.

14:35.288 --> 14:37.539
- You don't have to do this.
- Well, who else can pick a safe?

14:37.574 --> 14:39.591
It's fine.
Don't worry.

14:39.609 --> 14:41.426
I'll wait till he's gone.

14:41.444 --> 14:42.728
I got this.

14:53.339 --> 14:54.523
A subpoena.

14:54.557 --> 14:56.274
Yeah. It's for me,

14:56.309 --> 14:58.193
courtesy of David Rosen.

14:58.227 --> 15:00.078
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

15:00.113 --> 15:01.196
Are you saying I did?

15:01.230 --> 15:03.115
I'm saying you fixed
a national election,

15:03.149 --> 15:06.034
and now one of us
is gonna go to jail for it.

15:11.963 --> 15:13.463
We'll get you a lawyer,
one of the best,

15:13.497 --> 15:14.514
maybe a constitutional lawyer.

15:15.232 --> 15:16.365
We can make a case
for gay marriage...

15:16.400 --> 15:18.867
You not testifying
against your spouse.

15:18.901 --> 15:20.285
It could get us
to the supreme court.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.253
- Or, if the lawyer suggests...
- Are you kidding me?

15:22.287 --> 15:24.005
In order to go that far,
I'd have to get on the stand.

15:24.039 --> 15:25.640
And once I'm on the stand
in a grand jury room,

15:25.674 --> 15:27.024
I'd have to answer
David's questions.

15:27.559 --> 15:28.759
You can't bring a lawyer
to a grand jury.

15:28.793 --> 15:30.094
And if I answer
his questions,

15:30.128 --> 15:31.179
you're going to jail.

15:31.213 --> 15:33.480
And if I don't answer his
questions, I'm going to jail.

15:33.515 --> 15:34.965
We'll put you and Ella
on a plane.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.034
To Switzerland or France.
You like France.

15:37.068 --> 15:38.201
Ella's adoption isn't finalized.

15:38.236 --> 15:39.436
I'm not taking her
out of the country.

15:39.470 --> 15:40.887
And I'm not going anywhere
without the baby.

15:41.038 --> 15:42.556
- And I'm not leaving you.
- We would figure it out.

15:42.590 --> 15:45.358
Are you insane?!
I'd be a fugitive!

15:45.393 --> 15:47.477
I'm not made to be a fugitive.
I'm not made to break rules.

15:47.512 --> 15:50.597
I've got asthma. I'm made for
5-star hotels and room service.

15:50.631 --> 15:52.148
Fugitives don't get
room service.

15:52.183 --> 15:53.850
James...
What did you do?

15:53.884 --> 15:55.635
Did you seriously steal
the president election?

15:55.970 --> 15:57.570
And you thought
no one would notice?

16:00.224 --> 16:01.474
Cyrus!

16:01.525 --> 16:03.076
Are you listening to me?!

16:03.127 --> 16:04.811
I want some answers!

16:07.531 --> 16:09.532
Take off your clothes.

16:09.566 --> 16:10.967
What?

16:11.301 --> 16:13.052
Are... are you kidding me?

16:13.086 --> 16:15.838
I-I am not in the mood, Cy,
to put it mildly.

16:15.872 --> 16:17.590
- James, just take off your clothes.
- Why?

16:17.624 --> 16:19.492
I need to see if you're
wearing a wire.

16:19.526 --> 16:20.626
A wire?!

16:20.677 --> 16:22.328
Before we continue
this conversation...

16:22.362 --> 16:23.996
I would like you to remove
your clothing so I can make sure

16:24.047 --> 16:25.881
you're not wearing any
kind of listening device

16:25.899 --> 16:27.399
at the behest of the
department of justice

16:27.451 --> 16:29.218
or the "Washington Tribune"
or anyone else.

16:29.652 --> 16:31.353
I am not taking off my
clothes because you have

16:31.387 --> 16:32.804
some <i>insane</i> notion
that I'm wearing a wire!

16:32.856 --> 16:34.873
- Fine. Then we're done talking.
- I am your husband.

16:34.924 --> 16:36.791
You want to have an honest
conversation with your husband,

16:36.809 --> 16:38.977
show me you're clean!

16:39.012 --> 16:41.113
You could be wearing a wire.
Ever think about that?

16:42.699 --> 16:43.899
Oh...

16:49.873 --> 16:50.906
Fine.

16:52.058 --> 16:53.859
Fine. I hope you're happy.

16:54.844 --> 16:55.994
Good.

17:08.306 --> 17:09.440
Satisfied?!

17:09.491 --> 17:11.791
Yes.

17:11.826 --> 17:13.444
Now you're going
to tell me the truth.

17:13.478 --> 17:15.045
Yes.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.448
Okay. Were you involved

17:17.482 --> 17:19.116
in rigging the presidential election?

17:19.150 --> 17:21.684
No, I was not involved in rigging
the presidential election!

17:21.719 --> 17:23.270
You <i>were</i> involved!
I know you were involved!

17:23.788 --> 17:26.039
You gave me a baby.
I have a baby.

17:26.057 --> 17:27.540
Yes, you have a baby,
maybe because

17:27.575 --> 17:29.109
I'm a wonderful guy
who cares about you!

17:29.143 --> 17:31.711
Don't you dare pull that
"wonderful" crap with me.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.780
You think I don't know?
I know.

17:33.781 --> 17:35.932
I know you.
I know who you are!

17:35.967 --> 17:39.202
You are a political <i>animal!</i>
You live for the <i>hunt!</i>

17:39.253 --> 17:40.704
Right and wrong
mean <i>nothing</i> to you!

17:40.738 --> 17:42.005
It's about the power!

17:42.039 --> 17:44.291
But you smile at me,
and you offer me babies

17:44.325 --> 17:46.976
and you love me, and that's
on me, because I let you.

17:47.010 --> 17:49.245
But that stops
here and now!

17:49.279 --> 17:51.247
I mean it!
Cyrus Rutherford Beene,

17:51.281 --> 17:53.633
for once in your life,
show me who you are!

17:53.667 --> 17:56.102
If you love me,
show me who you are!

17:56.136 --> 17:57.286
What the hell do you
want me to tell you?!

17:57.321 --> 17:58.755
Tell me you stole
the White House!

17:58.806 --> 18:01.557
I stole the White House!

18:14.437 --> 18:17.789
I wasn't made to be
chief of staff!

18:17.824 --> 18:20.091
Do you know
what I was made... to be?

18:20.109 --> 18:23.278
I was made to be the President
of the United States.

18:23.313 --> 18:25.147
I was made to lead
the nation!

18:25.198 --> 18:27.816
I was made to ensure
this country's place

18:27.867 --> 18:30.085
in the world
for generations to come.

18:30.119 --> 18:31.737
I would have been
great at that!

18:31.771 --> 18:33.856
I have the stones!
I have backbone!

18:33.907 --> 18:35.324
I have the will.

18:38.278 --> 18:41.997
I would have been
a great president.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.333
But guess what?
I'm fairly short.

18:46.368 --> 18:48.469
And...

18:48.503 --> 18:50.004
I'm not so pretty.

18:50.038 --> 18:51.989
And I really like having
sex with men,

18:52.023 --> 18:53.624
so instead of being
president of this land

18:53.642 --> 18:56.160
that I <i>love,</i> I get to be

18:56.194 --> 18:58.028
the guy behind the President
of the United States.

18:58.063 --> 18:59.680
And, sure, I have power.

18:59.714 --> 19:01.715
I influence decisions.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.400
I help steer the country.

19:03.435 --> 19:05.002
But I'll never be
in the history books.

19:05.036 --> 19:09.373
My name will <i>never</i> be
on an airport or a doctrine.

19:09.407 --> 19:13.326
Being the guy behind the guy
is as far as my road goes.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.961
Eight years of this,

19:14.996 --> 19:17.898
and then I'm done
and off to the think tank

19:17.932 --> 19:20.917
or K street
or the poli-sci department

19:20.985 --> 19:23.703
of the Ivy of my choice.

19:23.738 --> 19:26.540
A nice life.

19:26.574 --> 19:28.375
It's respectable.

19:29.677 --> 19:32.379
But the... the peak,
the...

19:32.413 --> 19:34.197
the pinnacle? Uh...

19:37.518 --> 19:40.803
is... the rarest of air

19:40.922 --> 19:42.722
in my lungs?

19:43.457 --> 19:44.924
is happening right now.

19:44.958 --> 19:46.642
This is as high
as I get to climb.

19:46.677 --> 19:49.512
This is the top, and that
election was my shot.

19:49.546 --> 19:53.182
Fitzgerald Grant
was my shot.

19:53.216 --> 19:57.119
When your shot comes,
you either take it or you lose.

19:57.137 --> 19:59.055
And I...

19:59.089 --> 20:01.207
I've already lost enough!

20:04.211 --> 20:06.612
I'm done losing.

20:08.465 --> 20:10.533
I took my shot.

20:22.812 --> 20:24.246
She needs me.

20:27.934 --> 20:29.618
What are you gonna do?

20:29.652 --> 20:30.869
I'll sleep in her room tonight.

20:30.904 --> 20:33.539
What are...
What are you gonna do?

20:33.573 --> 20:35.541
What I have to.

20:35.575 --> 20:38.961
I'm gonna take care
of our baby girl, Cy.

20:38.995 --> 20:41.413
I love you.

20:41.498 --> 20:43.549
Is that enough?

21:16.959 --> 21:19.160
<i>Why do you care what</i>
<i>I do with the rest of my life?</i>

21:19.211 --> 21:21.930
<i>I don't. I'm just saying.</i>

21:21.964 --> 21:23.781
<i>I know.</i>

21:23.815 --> 21:25.917
<i>Besides, wouldn't you rather</i>
<i>be dating a hot-shot attorney</i>

21:25.935 --> 21:28.403
<i>in a suit than a conspiracy</i>
<i>whacko in a bathrobe?</i>

21:28.437 --> 21:30.471
- <i>We're dating?</i>
- <i>Aren't we?</i>

21:31.206 --> 21:33.224
<i>I mean, this is good, right?</i>

21:33.258 --> 21:35.559
<i>I feel like this is good.</i>

21:35.594 --> 21:37.545
<i>It's good.</i>

21:37.579 --> 21:41.031
<i>Abby, Teresa Dunn is lying,</i>

21:41.065 --> 21:43.434
<i>and I don't know why,</i>
<i>but that's not what upsets me.</i>

21:43.468 --> 21:45.986
<i>What upsets me is that you</i>
<i>haven't even given me a chance!</i>

21:46.021 --> 21:47.438
<i>It hasn't even</i>
<i>occurred to you</i>

21:47.472 --> 21:48.906
<i>that I might be worth</i>
<i>the benefit of the doubt?</i>

21:48.924 --> 21:50.791
<i>You're a bad guy!</i>

21:50.842 --> 21:53.544
<i>You look like a good guy,</i>
<i>but you're not!</i>

21:53.578 --> 21:55.179
<i>Abby?</i>

21:55.213 --> 21:56.864
<i>Are you awake?</i>

22:02.153 --> 22:03.854
<i>I love you.</i>

22:06.591 --> 22:08.792
<i>Abby?</i>

22:08.810 --> 22:10.460
<i>Are you awake?</i>

22:15.733 --> 22:17.418
<i>I love you.</i>

22:20.438 --> 22:22.239
<i>Abby?</i>

22:22.257 --> 22:23.691
<i>Are you awake?</i>

22:29.646 --> 22:31.914
<i>I love you.</i>

22:33.150 --> 22:35.385
<i>Abby?</i>

22:35.419 --> 22:36.953
<i>Are you awake?</i>

22:42.959 --> 22:44.493
<i>I love you.</i>

22:53.119 --> 22:56.138
I'm only going to ask this once.

22:57.256 --> 23:01.993
Did you pay Teresa Dunn to
tell me that David beat her?

23:02.027 --> 23:03.911
Yes.

23:11.353 --> 23:13.171
Who did you use?

23:18.393 --> 23:21.362
Hey. Where are you...
hey.

23:21.396 --> 23:24.030
You told me you cared
about me... like a sister!

23:24.049 --> 23:26.617
But I guess all that big office
talk was more important!

23:26.651 --> 23:28.202
Abby.

23:28.236 --> 23:29.887
Who am I kidding?
I don't blame you.

23:29.921 --> 23:31.371
- This isn't your fault.
- She had a reason.

23:31.389 --> 23:32.990
Yeah?
What was it?

23:33.024 --> 23:35.409
I don't know.
She had a reason!

23:35.443 --> 23:37.227
I don't know what it is.
I don't need to know.

23:37.278 --> 23:38.746
She asked me to do
something, I did it.

23:38.780 --> 23:41.565
And you know why I did.
There's a problem, you fix it.

23:41.816 --> 23:43.383
You and David Rosen
were a problem.

23:43.618 --> 23:45.152
You know who we are,
and you know what this is,

23:45.186 --> 23:47.187
and don't pretend you don't.
We do what needs to be done

23:47.221 --> 23:48.905
and we don't question why.

23:48.939 --> 23:50.440
We put the personal
to the left.

23:50.441 --> 23:51.941
Doesn't matter who gets hurt,
doesn't matter what gets broke.

23:51.976 --> 23:53.359
It's not the thing
that needs fixing.

23:53.394 --> 23:55.178
It <i>does not matter!</i>

23:55.212 --> 23:56.913
You want to cry about
your feelings? Hmm?

23:56.947 --> 23:58.865
Really? Here?
We don't get to have feelings.

23:59.383 --> 24:01.651
That's the job.
Gladiators don't have feelings.

24:01.685 --> 24:03.502
We rush into battle.
We're soldiers!

24:03.536 --> 24:05.304
We get hurt in the fight,
we suck it up

24:05.339 --> 24:08.341
and we hold it down,
and we don't question.

24:08.375 --> 24:09.775
And you know it, Abby.

24:11.745 --> 24:13.079
She saved me.

24:13.146 --> 24:14.513
She saved huck.
She saved Quinn.

24:14.548 --> 24:16.382
She saved <i>you.</i>

24:16.416 --> 24:18.134
And it's her life
on the line now.

24:18.168 --> 24:19.385
Over a cliff, Abby.

24:19.419 --> 24:22.238
Over... a... cliff.

24:23.189 --> 24:25.907
Or did that only apply as long
as liv didn't have any flaws?

24:28.477 --> 24:30.095
We owe her.

24:30.129 --> 24:32.864
And she needs
that Cytron card.

24:32.899 --> 24:33.982
Simple as that.

24:50.233 --> 24:51.466
You love me.

24:52.969 --> 24:55.320
I love you.

25:00.225 --> 25:03.043
David Rosen has the voting
machine software from Ohio.

25:03.078 --> 25:04.695
James knows about Defiance.

25:04.729 --> 25:07.465
He's going in to testify
before a grand jury today.

25:09.134 --> 25:11.869
So it's over. It's coming out.
I've played my last card.

25:13.104 --> 25:14.872
I haven't played mine.

25:23.781 --> 25:25.115
Yeah?

25:25.433 --> 25:27.150
I've got a job for you to do.

25:39.526 --> 25:43.326
- Oh, **
- I ** ** ** do that.

25:44.627 --> 25:48.527
- Knock'em dead.
- Ready to see justice served?

26:16.528 --> 26:19.112
I have $5,000.

26:19.147 --> 26:20.330
Okay.

26:20.965 --> 26:24.484
I want to hire you
to kill Hollis Doyle.

26:31.409 --> 26:32.608
What?!

26:32.626 --> 26:33.910
Where are you?
What's going on?

26:33.944 --> 26:35.812
I'm about to do the job
you want done.

26:36.146 --> 26:38.347
Tell the
speaker I'm running late!

26:38.382 --> 26:40.032
Yeah, so am I.
I'll call you when it's finished.

26:40.067 --> 26:42.085
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
Just wait. - I can't wait.

26:42.119 --> 26:43.336
He's about to walk into
the justice building

26:43.370 --> 26:44.653
- right now.
- Just hold on one minute.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.172
Look, I cannot go in there.
There are metal detectors.

26:46.223 --> 26:47.757
We have to do this
right now, outside.

26:47.791 --> 26:49.158
Just hold on one minute!

26:49.193 --> 26:50.426
Huck, he took everything.

26:50.461 --> 26:51.894
He took my boyfriend.

26:51.929 --> 26:54.380
He took my life, and
nothing happens to him?

26:54.431 --> 26:57.316
He just walks away?
He just gets to...

26:58.668 --> 27:01.537
I want you to kill
Hollis Doyle.

27:05.141 --> 27:06.775
Hey.

27:06.793 --> 27:09.344
Honey, please, don't do it.

27:09.478 --> 27:11.496
- Don't go in there.
- What am I supposed to do, Cy?

27:11.530 --> 27:12.731
Look, what do you
want me to do?

27:12.782 --> 27:15.367
I am begging you,
I am asking you, please,

27:15.418 --> 27:16.985
if you love me, stop walking.

27:17.020 --> 27:19.538
Do not do this.
Do not go in there.

27:19.572 --> 27:21.156
I love you. You know I do.

27:21.190 --> 27:23.191
But I love her, too,
and I can't go to jail.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.210
I can't just bail on her.
She needs me.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.095
I'm sorry, Cy.
I am.

27:29.399 --> 27:32.566
Is that enough?
$5,000 to kill someone?

27:32.584 --> 27:33.685
No.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.004
But I'll do it for free
if you want.

27:37.623 --> 27:39.707
- You will?
- I will.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.060
All right, what do
you want me to do?

27:42.111 --> 27:43.611
You've got, like,
three seconds to decide.

27:44.645 --> 27:48.098
But if I do that, if I kill
Hollis Doyle for you,

27:48.133 --> 27:49.983
you can't come back here.

27:50.018 --> 27:52.286
You can't work for Pope
and Associates anymore.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.588
- You can't be a gladiator.
- Why not?

27:54.622 --> 27:56.423
Because you want Hollis
dead for revenge.

27:56.458 --> 27:58.725
And we don't do revenge.
We solve problems.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.094
So you can be Lindsay Dwyer
and get revenge on Hollis,

28:01.112 --> 28:04.464
or you can be Quinn Perkins
and move on with your life.

28:04.482 --> 28:06.800
You can't have your new life
and also keep your old life.

28:07.035 --> 28:08.552
It doesn't work that way.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.354
So which is it?

28:12.757 --> 28:14.174
All right, this is it.

28:14.208 --> 28:15.842
What do you want me to do?

28:26.554 --> 28:29.205
What the hell?
You can thank me later.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.807
Stop, stop, stop.

28:30.841 --> 28:33.827
I said stop.

28:34.861 --> 28:37.746
Whatever.
I'm still billing you.

28:47.941 --> 28:49.341
Cyrus.

28:49.376 --> 28:51.977
I couldn't stop it.
James is going to testify.

28:52.011 --> 28:54.246
Do you swear
to tell the truth,

28:54.280 --> 28:55.914
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

28:55.932 --> 28:57.066
so help you God?

28:57.117 --> 28:58.817
Now it's over.

29:01.788 --> 29:02.888
I do.

29:08.444 --> 29:10.328
After you wrote
the article for the "Times,"

29:10.362 --> 29:12.146
I told you my theory
that Hollis Doyle

29:12.181 --> 29:13.731
was trying to rig voting

29:13.765 --> 29:15.599
- in favor of the pipeline?
- Yes.

29:16.502 --> 29:17.935
Hey.

29:19.053 --> 29:20.570
And did you
subsequently travel

29:20.605 --> 29:21.906
to the city of Defiance, Ohio,

29:21.940 --> 29:23.423
to see if that theory
was correct?

29:23.458 --> 29:24.541
Yes, I did.

29:24.776 --> 29:27.461
It's 9:00 in the morning.

29:27.495 --> 29:28.612
Drink with me.

29:28.647 --> 29:30.331
And what did you find
in Defiance?

29:32.851 --> 29:34.435
It's that bad?

29:39.557 --> 29:40.924
Drink with me.

29:42.710 --> 29:43.727
Nothing.

29:45.446 --> 29:47.680
- I'm sorry?
- Uh, I didn't find anything.

29:47.765 --> 29:49.599
You didn't find a
corrupted memory card

29:49.633 --> 29:51.751
- in one of the voting machines?
- Nope.

29:51.802 --> 29:53.870
A card which you
subsequently gave me.

29:53.904 --> 29:55.138
I didn't find a thing
in Defiance.

29:55.172 --> 29:56.223
I-I told you that already.

29:56.957 --> 30:00.059
Do you know what the penalty is
for lying to a U.S. attorney?

30:00.510 --> 30:02.678
Yes, but I'm not lying,
so it doesn't really matter.

30:02.696 --> 30:05.030
You had some far-fetched
theory about election rigging.

30:05.082 --> 30:07.616
And because of your relatively
high position at justice,

30:07.634 --> 30:09.952
I decided it might be
worth a shot to test it out.

30:09.986 --> 30:11.370
You see,
I used to be a journalist.

30:11.421 --> 30:13.105
Now I'm a stay-at-home dad.

30:13.140 --> 30:15.291
Anyway, I-I checked it out,
and I didn't find a thing.

30:15.325 --> 30:17.293
Which I told you
a couple of weeks ago,

30:17.327 --> 30:19.145
so I really don't know
why I'm here.

30:19.196 --> 30:21.914
The penalty for perjury
is five years in prison.

30:21.948 --> 30:23.833
Again, I don't know
how that applies to me.

30:23.867 --> 30:25.701
You took an oath,
and now you're lying!

30:25.735 --> 30:27.253
David, that's enough.

30:27.287 --> 30:29.422
Stop lying, and tell me what
you told me two weeks ago!

30:29.456 --> 30:31.457
- I just did.
- Do you want to go to prison?!

30:31.508 --> 30:32.875
- That's enough.
- Is that what you want?!

30:32.909 --> 30:34.210
Counselor!

30:51.149 --> 30:52.783
Oh, fun.
A party.

30:52.817 --> 30:54.217
When's the pizza arrive?

30:54.252 --> 30:55.902
Hopefully before
the police get here.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.938
It doesn't matter that you
couldn't get the Cytron card.

30:57.940 --> 31:00.774
Cyrus Beene's husband is testifying
before a grand jury.

31:00.808 --> 31:02.376
If he says what we think
he's gonna say...

31:02.427 --> 31:03.977
You go to jail. I know.

31:06.029 --> 31:08.081
Abby Whelan,
where are you?

31:09.433 --> 31:12.035
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

31:12.069 --> 31:13.636
The Cytron card.
The whole key to this case.

31:13.671 --> 31:15.838
The one thing I had left.
It was in my safe,

31:15.873 --> 31:17.240
and now it's not
because I was an idiot

31:17.274 --> 31:18.892
and left you alone
in my apartment.

31:18.926 --> 31:20.560
I... (Scoffs) I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:20.594 --> 31:22.979
- No? Then you wouldn't mind my
looking in your bag. - Hey, hey, hey.

31:23.013 --> 31:25.265
It's okay, Huck.
I have nothing to hide.

31:25.316 --> 31:27.517
David, stop.
Will you please look at me?

31:27.551 --> 31:29.469
- It's not in here.
- Of course it's not!

31:29.520 --> 31:31.738
- Because I didn't take it!
I would never... - So who did?

31:32.689 --> 31:34.439
Huh? Who cost me my job
and possibly my career?

31:34.474 --> 31:36.341
Why should I thank for that?
Was it you?

31:36.392 --> 31:38.660
Perhaps it was one of these
felons you keep on your payroll.

31:38.695 --> 31:40.596
You're being crazy.
It wasn't any of them.

31:40.630 --> 31:42.231
And I'm supposed
to believe you why?

31:42.265 --> 31:43.966
'Cause you lied to me and
told me you loved me?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.784
I do love you.

31:45.819 --> 31:47.619
No one has the stupid card, David.

31:47.670 --> 31:49.371
- Please, you have to believe me.
- Get your hands off of me.

31:49.405 --> 31:51.023
David, please...
I'm done with you.

31:51.057 --> 31:52.758
We're done.

32:00.350 --> 32:01.416
Come here.

32:09.259 --> 32:11.426
Wait.

32:23.339 --> 32:26.140
How's that for...
big office talk?

32:48.329 --> 32:52.032
Um, I thought you'd want
a ride to the funeral.

32:52.066 --> 32:54.384
I have a car coming, so...

32:56.671 --> 32:59.756
Liv, um, I...

33:02.193 --> 33:03.777
So that's it?

33:03.811 --> 33:04.978
We're done?

33:06.214 --> 33:08.148
I...

33:09.950 --> 33:13.786
I have your grandmother's ring.
I kept it safe.

33:13.804 --> 33:15.221
Right here.

33:23.281 --> 33:25.999
I've given you
this ring twice,

33:26.033 --> 33:28.701
and both times,
you've given it back.

33:28.735 --> 33:31.553
- Edison... - Tell me you don't
want to be married.

33:31.588 --> 33:34.923
Tell me that being a
senator's wife is too much.

33:34.958 --> 33:36.875
Tell me that you don't
want a family.

33:36.910 --> 33:38.360
Tell me why I've been
wasting my time.

33:38.395 --> 33:40.029
Tell me something.

33:40.063 --> 33:41.647
I'm sorry.

33:41.681 --> 33:44.166
Edison, I'm really sorry.

33:44.217 --> 33:46.568
I could marry you.
I could be a senator's wife.

33:46.603 --> 33:47.870
I'd probably be happy.

33:47.921 --> 33:49.655
I could probably
give all this up

33:49.689 --> 33:51.924
and live in a country house
and have babies and be normal.

33:51.958 --> 33:53.092
I could.

33:53.126 --> 33:55.144
But I don't want to.

33:55.178 --> 33:56.795
I'm not built for it.

33:56.813 --> 34:00.883
I don't want normal
and easy and simple.

34:00.917 --> 34:02.418
I want...

34:06.638 --> 34:08.289
- I want...
- What?

34:08.322 --> 34:11.458
<i>What?</i> What do you want,
Olivia?

34:13.862 --> 34:17.965
I want painful...

34:18.000 --> 34:19.850
Difficult,

34:19.885 --> 34:21.534
devastating,

34:21.570 --> 34:24.639
life-changing,
extraordinary love.

34:24.672 --> 34:26.172
Don't you want that, too?

34:30.027 --> 34:33.331
Love is not supposed to be
painful or devastating.

34:35.667 --> 34:39.286
Love isn't supposed
to hurt, Liv.

34:59.273 --> 35:01.190
Hi.

35:01.208 --> 35:02.559
Hello.

35:03.978 --> 35:07.930
I'm sure your eulogy
will be wonderful.

35:07.948 --> 35:11.167
You always find
the perfect words.

35:11.202 --> 35:13.269
Did you need something?

35:16.140 --> 35:19.275
I just wanted to say...

35:21.545 --> 35:24.480
I gave the ring back.

35:25.598 --> 35:27.983
Told Edison
I wouldn't marry him.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.638
I'll wait for you, Fitz,

35:32.672 --> 35:35.323
for as long as you need.

35:35.357 --> 35:36.725
Oh, that? Yeah.

35:38.994 --> 35:40.445
I changed my mind
about that.

35:40.479 --> 35:42.563
What?

35:42.581 --> 35:44.882
Don't...

35:44.934 --> 35:46.651
- Wait for me.
- Fitz...

35:46.702 --> 35:48.419
I don't know what
I was thinking. Um...

35:48.470 --> 35:52.040
Screwing your mistress is
one thing, but marrying her?

35:52.074 --> 35:53.975
It's political suicide,
really.

35:54.009 --> 35:56.945
I mean, you believe
that my presidency

35:56.979 --> 35:58.496
is more important
than anything else, right?

35:58.547 --> 36:00.281
You must.

36:00.316 --> 36:02.567
You worked so hard
to get me here.

36:14.612 --> 36:16.714
Justice Verna Thornton

36:16.765 --> 36:19.516
was more than a gifted jurist,

36:19.551 --> 36:21.318
a brilliant legal mind,

36:21.353 --> 36:23.003
and a dedicated
public servant.

36:23.037 --> 36:25.255
She was also a good
and faithful friend.

36:25.290 --> 36:27.641
You...

36:27.659 --> 36:31.044
Still don't know...

36:31.062 --> 36:33.630
Why... I called you here,
do you?

36:33.665 --> 36:34.732
Mnh-mnh.

36:34.766 --> 36:37.618
Of course not.

36:38.552 --> 36:42.805
I was the one who sent that
woman to assassinate you.

36:44.441 --> 36:46.792
What?

36:46.810 --> 36:51.047
No one was more devoted
to the law, to justice.

36:51.081 --> 36:53.266
But what set Verna Thornton apart

36:53.284 --> 36:55.818
was that she was fiercely
passionate about fairness

36:55.869 --> 36:58.121
above all.

36:58.155 --> 37:00.106
You are not the president.

37:02.609 --> 37:03.943
What are you talking about?

37:03.978 --> 37:05.811
Defiance county.

37:06.329 --> 37:09.148
Hollis Doyle rigged
the voting machines.

37:09.182 --> 37:12.785
We all knew.
We all helped cover it up.

37:12.819 --> 37:14.253
"We"?

37:14.287 --> 37:16.789
Yes, she was a tireless
crusader for justice,

37:16.823 --> 37:19.608
but those who knew her as well as I

37:19.643 --> 37:22.812
can testify to the fact that
she wasn't all about work.

37:22.846 --> 37:27.666
Don't you pretend
you don't know who.

37:28.384 --> 37:31.336
You're naive.
You're pampered.

37:31.370 --> 37:34.673
You sail through life
clueless as a child.

37:34.707 --> 37:36.508
But you're not stupid.

37:38.344 --> 37:39.811
Mellie.

37:42.281 --> 37:44.983
Cyrus.

37:50.740 --> 37:52.057
Olivia.

37:53.909 --> 37:56.444
We had a campaign stop in Vegas,

37:56.478 --> 37:59.163
and I can attest that getting
her away from a poker table

37:59.197 --> 38:01.766
was the toughest negotiation
I ever attempted.

38:01.800 --> 38:05.153
Mideast peace has nothing
on Verna Thornton on a roll.

38:05.204 --> 38:08.339
You made us love you.

38:08.374 --> 38:12.493
You made us... so devoted
with your charm.

38:13.244 --> 38:16.113
We would do anything
for you.

38:16.147 --> 38:17.948
We sold our souls for you!

38:17.982 --> 38:21.251
Something...
had to be done!

38:21.285 --> 38:23.520
And she was fiercely loyal.

38:23.555 --> 38:25.973
A great friend
in the trenches.

38:26.907 --> 38:30.026
But if you cross her, well,

38:30.060 --> 38:31.978
let's just say
she'll never forget it,

38:32.029 --> 38:33.113
and neither will you.

38:33.164 --> 38:34.898
You could have told me.

38:34.932 --> 38:37.534
Confessed to the press,
taken me down.

38:37.568 --> 38:39.602
You didn't have to shoot me,

38:39.637 --> 38:41.388
kill an innocent woman.

38:47.728 --> 38:49.746
But then you'd have to
admit your part.

38:53.183 --> 38:54.667
Then you'd lose
your grip on power.

38:56.085 --> 38:58.354
Is that right?

38:58.388 --> 38:59.622
Is your seat on the bench...

39:00.774 --> 39:02.541
your legacy...

39:04.010 --> 39:05.494
is it really worth my life?

39:08.298 --> 39:10.850
Not anymore.

39:10.884 --> 39:15.988
I'm meeting with a federal
prosecutor after you leave.

39:16.022 --> 39:19.859
I'm coming clean
before I die.

39:19.893 --> 39:25.564
But I wanted you to hear
it all... first.

39:25.615 --> 39:28.601
I owed... that...

39:29.935 --> 39:31.452
to your father.

40:30.144 --> 40:32.145
You've had
an exemplary career.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.648
Honorable.
Distinguished.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.619
I'll do it justice
in my eulogy.

40:39.653 --> 40:42.956
Your legacy will remain
untarnished.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.193
And so will mine.

40:55.019 --> 40:56.686
I'm sorry.

40:59.590 --> 41:02.025
I am so sorry.

41:21.961 --> 41:24.930
Despite the brevity
of her time on the bench,

41:24.948 --> 41:27.015
justice Verna Thornton's legacy

41:27.050 --> 41:30.219
will stand amongst those
who served for decades.

41:31.270 --> 41:34.305
We dedicate her service
to the ages

41:34.339 --> 41:36.807
and inscribe her memory
in our hearts.

41:49.371 --> 41:51.155
The nurse wants to know
whether or not

41:51.189 --> 41:53.224
you want to do the last
feeding with the baby.

41:53.258 --> 41:54.392
Do you?

41:56.728 --> 41:58.796
I thought you tried
to kill me.

42:04.586 --> 42:06.670
The night I was shot,

42:06.705 --> 42:08.355
my birthday.

42:10.475 --> 42:12.326
Before we got out
of the car,

42:12.360 --> 42:16.130
you changed your mind
about going to the party.

42:16.181 --> 42:18.432
I had a feeling.
I just...

42:18.483 --> 42:19.900
got worried and scared.

42:20.635 --> 42:22.052
I-I don't know why.

42:22.086 --> 42:25.272
I thought you tried
to kill me.

42:25.306 --> 42:26.773
Fitz, I would never
try to kill you.

42:26.824 --> 42:28.542
I know that now.

42:28.576 --> 42:30.510
But...

42:30.545 --> 42:32.345
you can't trust anybody.

42:33.364 --> 42:34.497
You can trust me.

42:37.435 --> 42:39.302
You're honest.

42:41.655 --> 42:43.155
I don't know what...

42:43.190 --> 42:45.040
You're the only one
who has always been honest

42:45.058 --> 42:46.325
about who you are.

42:47.561 --> 42:48.678
Fitz...

42:48.712 --> 42:50.112
Do you love me?

42:51.665 --> 42:52.698
What?

42:52.733 --> 42:54.100
Do you love me?

42:57.554 --> 43:00.089
Enough to...

43:02.175 --> 43:05.645
to be on my side?

43:05.679 --> 43:09.131
No matter what happens...

43:09.166 --> 43:10.366
What I've done.

43:12.502 --> 43:15.421
I have never left
your side.

43:15.472 --> 43:19.241
You left mine,
but I never left yours.

43:19.276 --> 43:21.344
And, yes,

43:21.378 --> 43:25.047
I do love you.

43:25.065 --> 43:27.033
No matter what.

43:29.335 --> 43:31.920
I have always loved you.

43:32.938 --> 43:34.873
No matter what.

43:38.394 --> 43:40.829
Then we're in this
together, okay?

43:40.863 --> 43:42.981
We have to be in this together.

43:44.450 --> 43:46.367
'Cause I don't have
anybody else.

43:46.385 --> 43:48.086
I don't...

43:51.440 --> 43:53.841
You're all I have.

43:58.931 --> 44:01.299
It's you and me.

44:05.688 --> 44:07.222
It's you and me.
