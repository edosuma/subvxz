ends up sucking at sports.

16:26.417 --> 16:27.375
Greg, heads up.

JOAN: You know,
I think you two

16:29.917 --> 16:32.500
are making this
much too complicated.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.583
When it’s time to have
another baby, you’ll know.

16:34.583 --> 16:35.834
We--we will?

16:35.834 --> 16:37.917
JOAN:
Yes, there’ll be a sign!

16:37.917 --> 16:40.375
Just like there was
when we got pregnant with Greg.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.417
There was a sign?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.208
JOAN:
We were all around the table,

16:43.208 --> 16:45.542
and somehow a chair
from the dining room

16:45.542 --> 16:47.458
had made its way
into the kitchen.

16:47.458 --> 16:49.291
I looked at that empty chair,

16:49.291 --> 16:52.458
and I knew something
was missing.

16:52.458 --> 16:55.875
And that something
was another baby.

16:55.875 --> 16:57.417
MATT:
What about me, Mom?

16:57.417 --> 16:58.959
What was the sign
you should have me?

16:58.959 --> 17:00.709
Oh.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.542
Remember what that sign was?

17:02.542 --> 17:04.291
I do.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.458
"Ten minute loading zone."

17:11.750 --> 17:12.917
It’s not up to us, you know?

17:12.917 --> 17:14.709
If it was up to us,
we wouldn’t know what to do.

17:14.709 --> 17:16.250
-But it’s not up to us.
-No.

17:16.250 --> 17:17.583
-No, it’s up to fate.
-Yeah.

17:17.583 --> 17:18.959

to find the answer,

17:22.542 --> 17:24.917

17:24.917 --> 17:27.542
Yes, it is.

17:27.542 --> 17:29.750
Wow.

Thought we’d have, like,
at least an hour or two
