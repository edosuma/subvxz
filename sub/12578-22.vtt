[Exclaiming]

00:43.343 --> 00:44.844
Dale, your wife's
a weather personality.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.847
Does she have any idea
when this
drought's gonna end?

00:47.847 --> 00:49.215
No relief in sight.

00:49.682 --> 00:51.768
And that's straight
from the a.p. News wire

00:51.768 --> 00:54.187
to nancy to me to you.

00:54.187 --> 00:57.023
Well, stage 1 water
rationing wasn't too bad.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.526
I just cut out
peggy's crystal light.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.812
When we hit stage 2,
i took away bobby's baths.

01:03.113 --> 01:06.116
But stage 3
is killing my lawn,

01:06.116 --> 01:07.450
and that affects everyone.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.373
Bobby!

01:13.373 --> 01:15.158
Have you lost your mind?

01:15.158 --> 01:16.960
I've got a girlfriend now.

01:17.460 --> 01:19.712
She expects me
to smell a certain way.

01:20.046 --> 01:22.165
Then suck it up
and take a shower.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.667
Eh, i don't like
to stand that long.

01:32.392 --> 01:33.393
Hey, uh...

01:34.561 --> 01:36.563
j.j., how'd we do?

01:36.563 --> 01:38.064
You're just
at your weekly allotment.

01:38.565 --> 01:41.151
Dang it! I scrimpe
d and saved all week
.

01:41.151 --> 01:43.770
Why don't you get
a couple of those
new low-flow toilets?

01:43.770 --> 01:45.772
They use about
half as much water

01:46.272 --> 01:48.858
and, uh, the water company
is giving 'em out for free.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.361
Well, i don't know.
My toilets have given me

01:51.361 --> 01:53.863
15 years of
dependable service
.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.366
I'm not one of those guys
who turns 40

01:56.366 --> 01:59.035
and runs out
and buys fancy new toilets
.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.672
(kahn)
Check it out, hank hill.

02:02.672 --> 02:05.041
Who got the green thumb now,
hayseed?

02:05.041 --> 02:07.961
What? How, in stage 3,
could you...

02:07.961 --> 02:10.346
.
I use secret asian
watering technique

02:10.797 --> 02:12.632
ah, come on. That's crazy.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.634
Don't let my geniu
s in mathematics

02:14.634 --> 02:16.553
blind you
to my mystical side.

02:16.553 --> 02:20.223
I could spit in a thimble
and water central park.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.608
[Laughing]

02:27.147 --> 02:30.650
Goodbye, toilets.
Thanks for everything.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.653
New low-flow toilets.
Boy, this is exciting.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.873
But i guess you guys
are probably
used to it by now.

Heck of a game

03:21.701 --> 03:25.705
so, uh, peggy, uh,
i'm just curious.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.207
How many flushes
was that?

03:27.207 --> 03:29.709
A lady does not
discuss such matters.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.211
It was 6.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.714
I'm averaging 4 myself,
but i'm just a kid.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.633
[Sighs]

03:36.633 --> 03:37.634
This is crazy.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.135
If you have to
flush twice,

03:39.135 --> 03:42.472
you're already using
as much water
as our old toilets.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.975
But we're flushing
3, 4, 6 times.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.810
We're not saving any water.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.396
If anything,
we are wasting water.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.732
Ah, i'm gonna call
the water company,

03:52.732 --> 03:54.817
see about gettin'
the high-flows back.

03:54.817 --> 03:55.818
Uh-uh. I already called.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.321
They take the old toilets,
they smash 'em up

03:58.321 --> 04:00.323
then dump them
in the gulf of mexico

04:00.323 --> 04:01.824
to make
an artificial coral reef.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.327

So, was i 20 gallons
over my limit,

04:27.850 --> 04:29.852
or was it a cool 40?

04:29.852 --> 04:32.355
Look, i already told you,
it's $100.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.823
It's a bribe, not a tip.

04:33.823 --> 04:35.992
Ok. Ok.

04:35.992 --> 04:38.278
.
Best $100 i ever spent

so, this dirty money going
for more steroids

Sorry. We don't stock
the good toilets anymore.

05:58.241 --> 05:59.492
Just the low-flows.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.327
And even if i did
have the high-flows,

06:01.828 --> 06:05.531
it would be illegal
to install them
in heimlich county.

,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.409
it would have to be
on the agenda.

all the power of my position

is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

to madeleine albright?

08:58.221 --> 09:01.724
there are limits
to our newly empowered
friend hank's power.

He deals in simple
county-level matters

09:04.860 --> 09:07.863
like the permit i need
to build my new fence.

09:07.863 --> 09:10.866
Now, dale, first you need
to write up your proposal.

09:10.866 --> 09:13.369
Then you need to present it
to the board for a vote.

09:13.369 --> 09:15.788
And then democracy happens.

09:15.788 --> 09:17.290

in the real world,

where things don't flush
like they do in the movies

10:52.718 --> 10:54.720
it can take 3, 4,

of my wife, peggy hill,

6 flushes

remove solid waste.

11:02.728 --> 11:06.232

are squandering more water

Mr. Hill,
i want to assure you

11:34.760 --> 11:35.928
Because of
the worsening drought,

11:36.379 --> 11:39.598
we thought we'd swap
these high-flows
for a couple of water-savers.

11:39.598 --> 11:42.601

the old toilets,

11:43.102 --> 11:44.103
