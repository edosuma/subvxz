00:11.279 --> 00:12.813
Oh, hey, Calvin.

00:12.913 --> 00:16.150
Ah, you sure are working on
your truck a lot these days.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.720
Well, a classic truck
like this needs a lot of TLC.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.622
It's keeping you
pretty busy, huh?

00:21.722 --> 00:23.657
What's your point, Dave?

00:23.757 --> 00:25.959
No point. Just...
Just an observation.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.063
Good. So you're not
going to say anything else?

00:29.163 --> 00:30.531
Nope.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.935
Just can't help
but wonder...

00:35.035 --> 00:37.105
if it's because
you sold the Pit Stop.

00:37.205 --> 00:40.241
Sure, you made a nice chunk
of change, but now your future

00:40.341 --> 00:43.777
is just one big question mark,
looking off into the abyss.

00:43.877 --> 00:47.781
Well, I was looking into my
engine before you bothered me.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.550
My rocker arms are knocking.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.452
I just need to adjust
my harmonic balancer.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.087
You know, Calvin...

00:53.187 --> 00:55.956
those are made-up
things, aren't they?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.891
No, they're not, Dave.

00:57.991 --> 01:01.195
Look, I just sold
the Pit Stop a minute ago.

01:01.295 --> 01:04.665
I'm-a find my next thing.
But who are you to judge?

01:04.765 --> 01:07.335
You built a birdhouse
with a door on it.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.270
Birds can't open doors.

01:09.370 --> 01:13.241
It is not a birdhouse.
It is a little library.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.343
It's a great way for neighbors
to share books

01:15.443 --> 01:16.677
and build a better
sense of community.

01:16.777 --> 01:20.248
And it is a great
father/son project.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.449
Can I put stickers on it?

01:21.549 --> 01:22.816
No.
Can I use the hammer?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.485
No, no.
Can I paint it orange?

01:24.585 --> 01:25.619
Oh, no.
Can I touch it?

01:25.719 --> 01:27.155
Grover, no.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.158
Cherish these moments, Grover.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.627
Will you look at that.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.163
It's a copy of my book.

01:35.163 --> 01:38.299
You wrote a book?
Well, good for you.

01:38.399 --> 01:41.969
Uh, why is this the first time
I'm hearing about it?

01:42.069 --> 01:44.305
Well, you know, I don't like
to go around bragging

01:44.405 --> 01:46.507
about being a published author.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.075
Came out years ago.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.843
<i>The Unboxed You:</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:52.180
<i>How to Get Out
of the Box You're In</i>

01:52.280 --> 01:54.282
<i>and Into the Box You Need.</i>

01:55.283 --> 01:56.750
By the time I'm done
reading the title,

01:56.850 --> 01:58.686
I'm done reading for the day.

01:59.753 --> 02:00.921
That's too bad, because I think

02:01.021 --> 02:02.190
that book could really help you.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.024
Did you
sell a lot of copies?

02:04.192 --> 02:04.992
Well...

02:05.092 --> 02:06.227
You know, with a book like this,

02:06.327 --> 02:08.262
it's not really about
sales numbers.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.565
It's more about metrics,
like reach and influence.

02:11.665 --> 02:12.900
So that's a no?

02:14.001 --> 02:16.837
You know what? I'm going
to put a copy in the library.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.039
Okay. Dave,
is that why you built that?

02:19.207 --> 02:21.108
So that you could put
your book in there?

02:21.209 --> 02:22.210
Please.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.212
So that's a yes.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.416
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:28.516 --> 02:29.950
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

02:33.754 --> 02:35.656
Marty? What are you
doing here?

02:35.756 --> 02:37.090
Isn't today a workday?

02:37.225 --> 02:39.360
Yes, Father, but I've decided

02:39.460 --> 02:41.462
to redefine what a workday
is for myself.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.830
Oh.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.366
He's mad at JPL for
blowing off his great idea,

02:45.466 --> 02:47.235
whatever that thing was.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.438
It was a prototype
for a balloon to send

02:50.538 --> 02:51.805
into the atmosphere
of Venus to collect samples...

02:51.905 --> 02:53.874
And I love it.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.144
Yeah, well, they didn't.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.247
So as an act
of personal empowerment,

02:59.247 --> 03:00.781
I am quiet quitting.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.683
You quitting that good job?

03:02.783 --> 03:04.652
No, I'm <i>quiet</i> quitting.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.288
I don't care
how loud you do it...

03:08.155 --> 03:10.258
I'm-a still
need you to pay rent.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.026
Quiet quitting
is a thing now, Dad.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.463
Yeah, it's all the rage.
It's like, um,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.765
streaking for millennials.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.868
It is nothing like streaking.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.938
No, it-it's a social
economic movement where

03:25.038 --> 03:26.340
if you don't feel
appreciated at work,

03:26.440 --> 03:28.141
you don't give them
your heart and soul.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.578
You do the bare minimum.
That way, you leave the rest

03:30.678 --> 03:33.013
of the day open to do things
you find truly rewarding.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.115
So, what are you doing?

03:36.016 --> 03:37.851
It's mostly playlists.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.120
But, but...

03:40.288 --> 03:42.456
I'm opening my mind
to finding that thing

03:42.556 --> 03:45.759
that truly fulfills me, because
my job isn't doing it right now.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.161
So you ghosting your career?

03:48.296 --> 03:51.031
How do you know ghosting, but
you don't know quiet quitting?

03:51.999 --> 03:54.001
There he is.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.769
There's my big scholar.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.472
I'm just taking
a couple of classes, Ma.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.540
Mwah.
Mwah.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.642
Aren't you embarrassed, Marty?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.911
Here you are "quiet
quitting" your career.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.613
And your brother's
going back to school,

04:05.713 --> 04:07.214
finishing his degree.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.651
Wait a minute.
Uh, I'm the role model now?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.020
Yeah.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.388
That's in your face!

04:22.330 --> 04:23.331
Shoot.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.998
Nobody's borrowed my book yet.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.067
The library's only been up
for a day.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.337
I bet the neighbors
haven't even noticed it yet.

04:29.337 --> 04:32.139
Gemma, did you leave
this vampire book in there?

04:32.239 --> 04:34.408
This is hot, smutty garbage.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.545
I'm loving it!

04:38.712 --> 04:40.881
So people have taken your books.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.652
That's nice.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.420
What's wrong with Dave?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.889
He wrote a book a few years ago
and it didn't sell,

04:48.989 --> 04:52.360
and now no one's even taking
it out of his free library.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.495
Aw, let me see it.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.896
<i>The Unboxed You:</i>

04:55.996 --> 04:57.931
<i>How to Get Out
of the Box You're In</i>

04:58.031 --> 04:59.367
<i>and Into the Box You Need.</i>

04:59.367 --> 05:01.702
Ooh, wow. It's really...
I know, I know.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.373
Ooh.
I just wish somebody
would check it out.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.810
Good luck because, honestly,
it looks kind of boring.

05:09.910 --> 05:13.280
Well, the cover's not great,
but the book's really good.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.982
Somebody might enjoy it.
I doubt it.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.050
Tina, please,
just take the book!

05:18.519 --> 05:21.922
I'm telling y'all,
it's the next big thing.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.791
An oxygen lounge?

05:23.891 --> 05:25.158
Yes!

05:25.258 --> 05:27.895
All I got to do is knock
out that back wall,

05:27.995 --> 05:30.230
build out a quiet lounge area,

05:30.398 --> 05:33.567
and fill it with cool,
clean oxygen.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.405
So what am I breathing
right now?

05:37.405 --> 05:38.171
Air.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.673
Doesn't air have oxygen?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.543
I don't know, Calvin.
I'm not a scientist.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.046
All I know is
people will pay me

05:46.146 --> 05:48.716
to let them sit in
the room and breathe.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.652
Well, Que, what's stopping you?

05:51.752 --> 05:57.057
I'm just looking for
a little seed money.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.760
Why are you looking at me?

05:59.860 --> 06:02.162
Well, I know you're looking
for the next thing.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.764
And when you
sold the Pit Stop,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.466
you got Diddy money.

06:06.434 --> 06:09.236
Well, Diddy didn't get rich
by selling air.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.638
Now, "diddy"?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.973
When I become
the king of oxygen,

06:13.073 --> 06:14.608
you'll be begging to get in.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.244
Oh, Que, will you stop
pressuring Calvin?

06:17.344 --> 06:18.646
Look, is he looking
for a reason

06:18.746 --> 06:20.047
to get out of bed
in the morning?

06:20.147 --> 06:22.450
Absolutely.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.485
Is there a great book out there

06:24.585 --> 06:27.855
that might help him find
his way? You know it.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.825
Is he looking at me
in a way that suggests

06:31.925 --> 06:33.126
that I should stop talking?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.695
Definitely.

06:36.296 --> 06:39.366
Look, Calvin,
Que's idea is clearly stupid.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.703
But if you're looking to invest
in a trailblazing idea,

06:42.803 --> 06:45.906
I've got it.
It's a new kind of dating app.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.008
Oh, Lord.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.777
Hold on. Trent,
let's hear it.

06:49.877 --> 06:52.846
Okay, so you know how
all these dating apps

06:52.946 --> 06:54.014
are just a free-for-all,

06:54.114 --> 06:55.549
people swiping left and right?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.084
Well, what if there was an app

06:57.184 --> 06:59.319
with a concierge where
they cut through the clutter

06:59.487 --> 07:01.388
and find the right girls
for you?

07:01.489 --> 07:03.023
And you would be that concierge?

07:03.123 --> 07:04.958
You already know.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.996
So people would pay you
to find the girls?

07:09.096 --> 07:12.332
And I will pay the girls
a percentage of what I make.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.304
I might be mistaken,
but, um...

07:19.206 --> 07:20.674
wouldn't that
make you a pimp?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.676
Would you say that to eHarmony?

07:23.577 --> 07:25.879
It's an app, Dave.
I'm calling it...

07:25.979 --> 07:28.148
Trey's List.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.883
Of prostitutes.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.921
Nah, that name's too long.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.228
Hi, Professor Pinkler?

07:41.328 --> 07:44.164
Uh, no, I am not the professor.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.934
I'm Malcolm. I'm a student.

07:48.101 --> 07:51.304
Oh, you are?

07:53.073 --> 07:56.544
Yes, I am. I'm, uh,
back to finish my degree.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.011
Just took a little break.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.680
Oh, to raise a family?

08:01.715 --> 08:04.552
No, to play baseball.
But thank you.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.620
Oh, hello.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.421
You must be Dean Ramilton.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.090
They told me
you'd be dropping by.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.126
No, I am not the dean.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.628
I'm a student.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.264
Oh, uh, continuing education?

08:17.364 --> 08:19.567
No, regular student.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.970
Ah. G.I. Bill.
Thank you for your service.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.573
No, no, no,
I'm not a soldier, okay?

08:25.573 --> 08:28.208
I-I'm a baseball coach.
At this school.

08:28.308 --> 08:32.613
And we are 11-2, so...
All y'all are welcome.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.151
Wow, pencils.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.222
You got an abacus
in there, too?

08:43.190 --> 08:46.393
All right, people, welcome.
I'm Dr. Pinkler.

08:46.493 --> 08:47.728
Please open your Blackboard app

08:47.828 --> 08:49.129
and on the right-hand
drop-down menu,

08:49.229 --> 08:50.598
you can mark yourselves present,

08:50.698 --> 08:53.601
then open the syllabus tab
and select "review."

09:04.177 --> 09:05.713
So what's Blackboard?

09:07.480 --> 09:08.982
It's an app.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.719
You need your login.

09:11.819 --> 09:12.953
It's in your portal.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.622
Right.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.626
I have a portal?

09:18.726 --> 09:21.361
Uh-oh, Mr. Malcolm's confused.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.298
Mr. Malcolm?
I am not a mister, okay?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.634
And I am not confused.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.335
I just... Uh, I don't
have the thing

09:28.435 --> 09:31.438
to put my number in and make the
other thing open and drop down.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.674
Can someone help this man?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.342
He's a veteran, for God's sake.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.110
I am not a vet...

09:37.210 --> 09:38.445
Whatever, man.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.648
Can you...?

09:46.019 --> 09:48.255
Well, my car battery is almost
completely out of juice,

09:48.355 --> 09:50.523
and I can't install
a charger at my house

09:50.658 --> 09:51.825
because my landlord is too cheap

09:51.925 --> 09:53.193
to upgrade the electrical panel.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.697
Well, your
landlord sounds smart...

09:56.797 --> 09:58.766
and handsome.

09:59.532 --> 10:00.968
Dad, come on.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.003
I thought you charged
your car at work.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.673
Well, yeah, I used to,
but now I'm going in later,

10:05.773 --> 10:07.741
so all the charging
spaces are already taken.

10:07.841 --> 10:11.111
You see, I told you
to buy a real car, but no.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.914
You all worried
about the environment.

10:15.515 --> 10:16.850
Yes, I am.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.585
There's no way I'm ever
going back to a gas car.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.520
Electric cars are the future.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.724
Well, here in the present,

10:23.824 --> 10:26.059
looks like your ass
ain't going nowhere.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.831
Oh, hey, Malcolm, how was
your first day of class?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.966
I don't want
to talk about it, Mama.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.903
Ooh! Yeah, I know
that one.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.237
That's what I used to say when

10:37.337 --> 10:38.638
I got picked on
in elementary school.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.607
And middle school.
And high school.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.842
And the first semester
of college.

10:41.942 --> 10:45.045
But then I found
my friend group.

10:46.714 --> 10:49.249
Yeah, well, they clowned me
for being old.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.952
They gonna ask me if I
stop my car with my feet.

10:54.521 --> 10:55.689
Like Fred and them.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.792
It is not funny.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.063
Wilma!

11:03.163 --> 11:04.264
Stop that.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.366
Leave my baby alone.

11:06.466 --> 11:09.102
Yeah, well, then they all went
out for burgers without me.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.271
Oh, man, they were probably just
worried about your cholesterol.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.382
Gemma!

11:26.954 --> 11:28.822
Someone checked out my book.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.958
What? Really?

11:31.058 --> 11:33.660
Oh, that's great
news, honey. Yeah.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.595
You know, Calvin,
I'm telling you,

11:35.763 --> 11:36.897
you should really
check it out.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.365
It is finally finding
its audience.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.466
You know what?

11:39.566 --> 11:40.901
I should probably put more out.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.369
I hope I have extra copies.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.272
Mm-hmm. Oh, you have three
boxes full of them.

11:46.439 --> 11:50.277
Which is crazy,
considering how good it is.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.515
You know, Calvin,
what you're going through,

11:55.615 --> 11:56.850
it's very common.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.619
After a big life change,
like... like...

11:59.787 --> 12:01.321
like the end of a career,

12:01.421 --> 12:03.490
you know, it's very
normal to feel lost.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.894
Is it normal
to feel really annoyed?

12:08.395 --> 12:11.131
I'm just saying, it is
all covered in chapter seven:

12:11.231 --> 12:15.235
"Take the I Out of Failure
and Put It Into Success."

12:15.335 --> 12:18.438
Where? At the end?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.507
"Successi"?

12:20.607 --> 12:22.876
I'm serious, Calvin.
Let me give you a copy.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.111
It could really help you.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.478
I-I don't need your help.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.214
Well, maybe you
just don't know it yet.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.983
Now, see, this is what
you always do.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.385
You decide
that I have a problem,

12:32.485 --> 12:36.423
and then you decide
that you have the answer.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.825
It's condescending.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.027
Is it really?

12:41.128 --> 12:43.163
See, there you go.
You're doing it right now.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.867
Don't you slam
your little door on me.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.306
So, if we're talking about
the Harlem Renaissance,

12:53.406 --> 12:55.508
then you cannot leave out
Langston Hughes

12:55.608 --> 12:56.844
and Zora Neale Hurston.

12:56.844 --> 12:59.446
Somebody read the material.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.950
Somebody was probably there.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.685
Right, Malcolm?

13:05.853 --> 13:08.288
No, Kiefer, not right.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.523
Hey, Malcolm.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.558
Oh, are you on a Zoom?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.160
No, it's okay. I...

13:13.260 --> 13:14.594
Ah, I put it on mute.

13:14.694 --> 13:17.730
Okay, well, Mommy
brought you a study snack.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.366
Ooh, yeah.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.135
You are the best, Mama.
Ants on a log.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.472
Ooh.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.107
Are those the kids
that were mean to you?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.275
Yep, that's them.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.278
Especially Kiefer,
in the upper left.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.212
Right there.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.780
You know what, Malcolm?

13:33.881 --> 13:37.184
If they don't want to be friends
with you, that's their loss.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.453
You're smart and you're sweet
and you have a lot to offer.

13:40.553 --> 13:41.788
You think so, Mama?

13:41.889 --> 13:43.323
I know so, baby.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.524
Oh, love you.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.060
Mmm, I love you more,
Booby Butt!

13:48.161 --> 13:49.296
All right, well, enjoy!

13:49.396 --> 13:50.697
Okay.
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

13:50.797 --> 13:51.932
Mwah, mwah,
mwah, mwah, mwah!

13:52.032 --> 13:53.600
Oh, oh.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.239
Mm.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.076
That's pretty good.
Looks it.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.348
I am not on mute, am I?

14:10.450 --> 14:11.551
No.

14:11.651 --> 14:14.154
Oh, damn, man. Oh.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.822
Maybe I am old.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.657
Still not on mute.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.526
Oh, damn!

14:22.495 --> 14:27.600
Grover, I'm not giving
you $30,000 for candy.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.071
Not candy. Crypto candy.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.940
I heard you were
looking to invest,

14:32.940 --> 14:36.543
and trust me, you want to
be in on the ground floor.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.747
Here. I'm going to give you five
dollars to get off my porch.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.450
Go on, now.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.189
I am so tired of everybody

14:49.289 --> 14:50.790
hitting me up
with their silly ideas.

14:50.958 --> 14:54.127
If I wanted to waste my money,
I'd start a record label.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.096
What?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.465
What is Dave's book
doing here?

14:58.565 --> 15:01.068
Gemma asked me to take it
out of his little library.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.835
No one else would.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.071
Are you surprised?

15:04.171 --> 15:05.705
I mean, what kind of
advice is this?

15:05.805 --> 15:10.143
"A kernel of an idea
is like a kernel of corn.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.480
It's never going to pop if
you don't get it off the cob."

15:14.414 --> 15:15.482
You know what?

15:15.582 --> 15:16.984
This is weird,
even for Dave.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.554
What are you doing?
Going through the footage

15:21.654 --> 15:22.990
from our doorbell camera.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.425
Why?
Because I put out
three more copies

15:25.525 --> 15:27.094
of my book and they've
all been taken.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.761
I want to see who my fans are.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.730
Dave, no! No.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.399
Respect their privacy.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.068
They took your book
because they need help.

15:35.168 --> 15:39.006
You don't want this
to turn into a-a HIPAA thing.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.644
Is that you?
No.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.184
Then why did you
slam my laptop?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.552
HIPAA?

15:58.391 --> 16:01.194
Marty? Why'd you take an Uber?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.630
Because, Dad, my car's battery

16:03.730 --> 16:05.132
isn't holding
a good charge anymore.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.799
I had just enough juice
to make it to the mall,

16:06.899 --> 16:08.735
where half the charging spaces
were broken

16:08.835 --> 16:10.403
and the other half
were occupied...

16:10.503 --> 16:11.471
by gas guzzlers!

16:11.571 --> 16:13.806
Hey, I only park there

16:13.906 --> 16:15.842
because it's closest
to the door.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.577
What?

16:18.378 --> 16:19.946
Anyway, replacing the battery

16:20.047 --> 16:21.548
is going to cost a fortune
at the dealership.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.383
So take it somewhere else.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.651
There isn't any place else.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.219
No one else services them.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.288
Huh. So...

16:28.388 --> 16:29.856
they get to charge you
an arm and a leg

16:29.956 --> 16:32.092
because they're
the only game in town?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.526
Exactly.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.162
Huh.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.596
What?

16:36.696 --> 16:40.400
Marty, electric cars
are my corn on the cob.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.470
Daddy, do you need to lie down?

16:43.570 --> 16:47.207
No, your charging situation

16:47.307 --> 16:48.475
gives me a kernel.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.977
Now, we need to shuck
that kernel

16:51.078 --> 16:53.446
and pop that thing.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.815
Let me get you a cold cloth.

16:55.915 --> 16:56.949
Mama!
Okay.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.386
Marty, listen.
Look, I'm fine.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.820
All right? Just think about it.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.190
For the first time
in human history,

17:03.290 --> 17:05.092
there are old electric cars.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.860
All right? And the only
people that service them

17:07.960 --> 17:09.362
are the overpriced dealerships.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.964
So, somebody's going
to fill that gap

17:12.099 --> 17:13.800
and make a lot of money.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.837
Oh, my God.
Are you a genius?

17:17.937 --> 17:20.473
Are you just realizing that now?

17:24.944 --> 17:28.115
Hey, Malcolm.
Okay, what you got?

17:28.115 --> 17:30.350
How old am I today, huh?

17:30.450 --> 17:33.153
What, did I save
Private Ryan?

17:35.788 --> 17:37.457
Did I have a beeper?

17:39.659 --> 17:42.829
Malcolm, about that.
We feel awful.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.198
I thought we were
just joking around.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.533
Now we realize...

17:46.633 --> 17:49.769
there's nothing funny
about bullying.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.440
Y'all didn't bully me, okay?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.242
I am a grown-ass man.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.876
It's okay, Malcolm.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.545
We heard what your mom said.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.148
We made you feel different.
Less than.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.318
We would cancel ourselves
if we could.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.521
Oh, canceling is when--

18:08.621 --> 18:10.990
I know what canceling is.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.362
Okay, people,
take your seats.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.729
The servers are down,

18:16.829 --> 18:20.567
so you're going to take
your quiz on Scantrons.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.769
Oh, man.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.838
Uh, Malcolm?
Yeah?

18:26.773 --> 18:29.008
Could we borrow pencils?

18:33.713 --> 18:36.583
Well, I guess, uh,

18:36.683 --> 18:39.186
they don't have pencils
in your portals?

18:42.054 --> 18:45.425
The reason no third-party
garages fix electric cars

18:45.525 --> 18:47.760
is the companies each have
their own operating system.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.197
And that's a problem?
Well, not for me.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.898
If you give me
their motherboard,

18:51.998 --> 18:54.100
I can reverse-engineer
the software and mod the UI.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.469
And that's good?
That's great.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.104
Well, all right.

18:58.205 --> 19:01.208
Come on, Marty, let's put our
heads together, you know?

19:01.208 --> 19:04.811
I mean, you're tech savvy,
and I'm savvy about business... Yeah.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.813
...and people and mechanics...
Mm-hmm.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.949
...and marketing and looking
good and dressing well.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.984
Charisma, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.620
I-I get it, Daddy,
I get it.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.088
But, you know, why has this
never occurred to us before?

19:16.223 --> 19:19.426
Because we've been
stuck in our own boxes.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.094
Think of it like the jungle gym.

19:22.229 --> 19:25.097
The great idea
is up there at the top,

19:25.232 --> 19:27.234
and there are lots
of ways to get there.

19:27.334 --> 19:31.904
But sometimes the best route
is to go sideways

19:32.004 --> 19:34.241
and find a different path.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.250
Oh, damn.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.517
You read my book.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.954
Chapter six: "The Jungle Gym
of Inspiration."

19:49.689 --> 19:51.824
Wait, is that where
the corn kernel came from?

19:51.924 --> 19:53.826
Ha! You read chapter 12, too?

19:53.926 --> 19:55.695
I knew it!
Okay, all right.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.330
You know, I may
have skimmed it.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.432
It was a'ight.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.736
It was a'ight.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.175
That's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.849
$30,000 for candy
that doesn't exist?

20:16.949 --> 20:20.420
Well, it exists.
You just can't eat it.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.621
Why not?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.189
Because it's in
the metaverse.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.992
So if I want my candy,
I got to drive to the metaverse?

20:26.092 --> 20:28.361
No, you can't drive there.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.896
It's on the Internet.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.964
But you can sell your
candy to somebody else

20:32.064 --> 20:33.500
for much more
than it's worth.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.601
But what's it worth?

20:34.701 --> 20:36.736
Today, nothing.

20:38.004 --> 20:41.107
B-But tomorrow, who knows?

20:42.174 --> 20:43.776
Boy, if you
weren't Gemma's son...

20:43.876 --> 20:45.845
Here.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.180
Take this five dollars
and get off my porch.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.182
Go on, now.

20:52.819 --> 20:56.088
Works every time.
