WEBVTT

00:32.449 --> 00:33.533
Crush her!

00:36.077 --> 00:36.995
Let's go!

02:03.790 --> 02:09.295
-Dongcheon!
-Dongcheon!

02:09.379 --> 02:13.007
<i>-Dongcheon!
-Dongcheon!</i>

02:15.635 --> 02:16.970
You up, moron?

02:17.053 --> 02:19.180
Now that you're up,

02:19.264 --> 02:20.974
go and kill yourself.

02:24.769 --> 02:28.106
You got beat up
by a fucking girl and passed out.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.024
I'd die from the humiliation…

03:04.225 --> 03:05.393
About earlier…

03:10.064 --> 03:11.316
I'm sorry.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.612
What are you sorry for?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.156
It was a competition.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.666
Hey, how about a midnight snack?

03:29.250 --> 03:31.377
What? Are you craving soju?

03:31.461 --> 03:33.171
So you can drink yourself to death?

03:33.254 --> 03:34.088
No.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.341
That's not what I mean.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.071
What?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.908
Are you scared?
You said you wanted to all this time.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.702
Has this asshole lost his mind?

04:05.995 --> 04:07.372
Hey.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.623
Don't be stupid.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.750
The boss brought her here.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.710
She won't remember a thing.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.214
I roofied her water.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.809
What a scheming asshole you are.

05:09.892 --> 05:12.770
How can I refuse
when you went through all the trouble?

05:15.690 --> 05:16.524
Hey.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.861
Don't go if you're scared, sissy.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.592
Thanks, Gangjae.

05:44.343 --> 05:48.765
I told you you're the prettiest one here,
fucking bitch.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.392
I'm so hard right now. She looks yummy.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.275
I won't be too rough. Stay still.

06:04.363 --> 06:05.782
Stay still.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.950
It'll be over soon.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.622
Come on.

06:13.664 --> 06:14.916
Fuck, she's driving me mad.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.086
DECEASED, YOON DONGHOON

06:20.296 --> 06:21.464
Fuck!

06:26.928 --> 06:28.221
I'll kill you both.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.184
-I'll kill you both.
-Damn, this fucking bitch.

06:34.852 --> 06:35.853
Shit!

06:37.939 --> 06:39.482
You fucking bitch!

06:50.785 --> 06:51.619
You need to die.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.079
I'm fucking screwed!

06:53.162 --> 06:54.163
Come here, bitch.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.543
-Gangjae! I'm so screwed.
-Damn it!

06:59.544 --> 07:01.838
I'm screwed, you fucking asshole!

07:01.921 --> 07:02.922
Come here.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.925
Where the fuck are you going?

07:11.430 --> 07:12.974
-Gangjae! Stop it!
-Fucking bitch.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.058
Gangjae!

07:30.908 --> 07:33.494
Face, arm, leg.

07:35.204 --> 07:36.247
Choose one.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.041
I'll only mangle one.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.056
I'm sorry.

07:55.766 --> 07:56.809
It was a mistake.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.728
That's why…

08:01.439 --> 08:02.648
I won't kill you.

08:02.732 --> 08:03.566
Choose.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.321
Are you abandoning me?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.242
You said I was useful.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.578
It's quite unfortunate.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.628
I figured this was inevitable.

08:23.711 --> 08:26.088
It was something she had to
go through at least once.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.799
But I didn't know…

08:33.888 --> 08:35.556
it would be you.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.767
Please, forgive me.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.395
All I did was beat some bitch up a little!

08:44.815 --> 08:46.776
I brought her personally.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.738
You shouldn't have touched her.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.208
Which will it be?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.004
I'll decide.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.174
Please. No. Please no.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.467
Please, don't.

09:49.505 --> 09:54.510
DECEASED, YOON DONGHOON

11:35.486 --> 11:36.946
If you're done crying, leave.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.491
Because of you,

11:41.367 --> 11:43.160
I lost a valued subordinate.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.623
This is your last chance.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.961
Your chance to stop being foolish.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.424
I'm not going anywhere.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.012
I served Donghoon

12:02.680 --> 12:03.806
very closely.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.685
He didn't belong in a crime ring.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.146
The same goes for you.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.607
Stop it now.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.281
It's too late to stop.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.061
Sit.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.159
I used to come here often with Donghoon.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.581
Did your dad teach you how to drink?

13:22.384 --> 13:23.260
Drink.

13:38.734 --> 13:39.902
Does it hurt?

13:43.364 --> 13:44.406
No.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.411
You never learned
how to say that you're in pain.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.873
Or you had no one to teach you.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.587
There was one person…

14:01.465 --> 14:02.633
but he died.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.681
Perhaps, living…

14:10.057 --> 14:12.601
is the process
of meeting someone like that.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.647
Someone you can tell that you're in pain

14:17.565 --> 14:18.983
and that things are too hard.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.612
Do you have someone like that?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.074
I did, but he died.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.728
Yoon Jiwoo died today.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.567
Do Gangjae was expelled.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.360
Gangjae

15:03.944 --> 15:05.571
killed the girl.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.116
Oh Hyejin.

15:11.368 --> 15:12.578
From now on,

15:14.496 --> 15:16.081
you'll live by this name.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.013
This is the gun that killed your dad.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.391
The killer dumped it, and we found it.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.646
Who was it?

15:39.521 --> 15:41.190
This gun is a police issue.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.027
Dong-hun's killer is a cop.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.864
Find him

15:50.532 --> 15:51.533
and kill him.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.975
<i>From now on,
your life belongs to the organization.</i>

17:00.102 --> 17:03.689
<i>No matter what you do,
the organization will protect you.</i>

17:05.691 --> 17:07.443
<i>Betray us, and we will kill you.</i>

17:47.232 --> 17:48.192
What now?

17:50.402 --> 17:51.528
We go up.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.697
What?

17:54.573 --> 17:56.075
We don't know how many there are.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.938
Hey. Call for backup
and come to the entrance.

18:43.080 --> 18:43.914
This is--

19:09.314 --> 19:10.232
Who are you?

19:10.899 --> 19:11.733
Excuse me?

19:13.318 --> 19:14.361
What?

19:14.444 --> 19:16.572
Which department are you with, asshole?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.199
Money first.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.497
That's way too expensive
to hand over to you.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.957
Call your boss.

20:51.917 --> 20:52.918
Shit.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.337
If we're going to be partners,
I should see him at least.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.172
We need to share the risk.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.133
Gosh.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.470
Meth supply is running low these days,

21:04.721 --> 21:06.306
but I guess not you guys.

21:07.015 --> 21:07.933
Forget it.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.768
-I'm leaving.
-All right.

21:10.894 --> 21:11.728
Sit.

21:12.729 --> 21:13.647
Shall I?

21:14.648 --> 21:16.483
Radio her that this is a sting.

21:18.777 --> 21:19.695
You little…

21:20.946 --> 21:21.863
Now.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.909
This twerp came alone
and he wants to talk in person.

21:26.910 --> 21:27.828
<i>Hyejin.</i>

21:27.911 --> 21:29.997
-I can't believe this.
-<i>They're in the middle of an operation.</i>

21:30.080 --> 21:31.290
<i>Hyejin.</i>

21:31.373 --> 21:32.374
<i>Hyejin.</i>

21:35.377 --> 21:37.254
-Freeze. Police.
-Are you a narc?

21:37.337 --> 21:38.880
-What the hell are you saying?
-Changoo, get up.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.424
Damn it!

21:45.012 --> 21:47.222
-Shit.
-Let's go!

21:48.140 --> 21:50.183
He's getting away! Grab that asshole!

22:15.959 --> 22:18.211
<i>Hey. Block all exits. Get them.</i>

22:22.215 --> 22:25.302
Park Changoo. You're under arrest
for the murder of Lee Sumin.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.014
Damn it! I'll walk on my own.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.682
-Hey.
-Shit.

22:30.766 --> 22:31.641
Stop right there.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.310
-Hey!
-Seriously!

22:33.393 --> 22:35.062
-I said I can walk on my own.
-Damn it.

22:35.145 --> 22:35.979
Hey!

22:40.067 --> 22:41.526
Who are you, jerk?

22:41.610 --> 22:42.986
What about you, jerk?

22:43.070 --> 22:43.945
What?

22:47.741 --> 22:49.576
Sergeant Jeon Pildo from Narcotics.

22:49.659 --> 22:50.994
So you are a narc!

22:52.996 --> 22:55.123
Violent Crimes Team Two,
Corporal Oh Hyejin.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.126
Hey, are you okay? Try to get up.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.463
My leg. I think it's broken.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.714
Get a grip.

23:02.798 --> 23:03.924
Gosh.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.133
-Get an ambulance.
-Yes, sir.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.510
Clean this up.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.887
Hey. Where's Pildo?

23:08.970 --> 23:09.846
He's upstairs.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.184
Do you know what you've done?

23:14.267 --> 23:15.227
Pretty much.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.980
-I think I do, sir.
-That's not enough.

23:19.064 --> 23:22.359
You just shat on
a six-month-long operation.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.403
We're taking this asshole.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.863
Damn it!

23:26.947 --> 23:29.116
-You can't do that.
-I can't…

23:29.199 --> 23:30.242
I can't?

23:31.493 --> 23:33.578
Can't you make heads or tails of this?

23:34.746 --> 23:35.872
Are you messing with me?

23:35.956 --> 23:37.874
-He's a murder suspect.
-Hyejin!

23:40.293 --> 23:41.586
It's Captain Lee.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.882
-Get over here.
-Gosh, seriously.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.261
Yes, sir.

23:51.054 --> 23:52.222
What?

23:54.307 --> 23:55.600
All right, sir.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.064
Send him over once you're done with him.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.151
Stop right there.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.360
Hey!

24:06.820 --> 24:09.030
I never want to see you again.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.908
-Get over here.
-Hold on.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.703
I'll walk on my own!

24:17.414 --> 24:18.248
Move it.

24:19.457 --> 24:20.375
Damn it.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.703
Mr. Choi.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.372
I'm sorry.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.375
This will never happen again.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.795
We've worked together for ten years.
Haven't we?

25:13.303 --> 25:14.471
Exactly.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.434
Ten years. So why did you do it?

25:21.811 --> 25:23.438
You know very well what I'm like.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.150
I'll give you the factory and the drugs.

25:27.984 --> 25:31.279
I must have lost my mind for a minute.

25:33.782 --> 25:34.658
Please spare me.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.203
My daughter just started college.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.165
I'll make sure
your family has a nice funeral.

25:43.124 --> 25:44.167
Mr. Choi.

25:45.585 --> 25:46.795
Mr. Choi.

25:47.754 --> 25:48.755
Mr. Choi…

25:55.470 --> 25:58.014
What are you doing? Let go.

25:59.516 --> 26:01.101
That asshole.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.617
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

27:07.083 --> 27:08.877
Did you get them checked?

27:16.468 --> 27:17.635
Corporal Oh Hyejin?

27:25.685 --> 27:27.145
Yes, I'm Oh Hyejin.

27:32.692 --> 27:33.985
Do you know who I am?

27:37.906 --> 27:38.823
I do, sir.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.993
Captain Cha Giho of Narcotics.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.921
OFFICER: OPEN RECRUIT
CORPORAL: SPECIAL PROMOTION

27:53.004 --> 27:56.508
FATHER: OH JINYEONG
MOTHER: BAE SUYEON

27:57.258 --> 27:58.385
Why did you do it?

27:59.135 --> 27:59.969
Pardon?

28:00.845 --> 28:02.847
You didn't have conclusive evidence.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.892
The arrest was unreasonable.

28:05.975 --> 28:09.687
The motive was clear
and there was a high risk of him fleeing.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.356
That's insufficient
for an arrest without a warrant.

28:11.439 --> 28:12.899
Park Changoo has three priors.

28:12.982 --> 28:15.443
He'd flee for sure if I said I was a cop.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.821
It was sufficient.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.622
You applied to our team twice.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.291
-Yes, sir.
-Why?

28:30.792 --> 28:32.460
Why do you want to join our team?

28:35.422 --> 28:36.965
There's someone I want to catch.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.049
Who?

28:42.011 --> 28:43.722
Is there something you can't tell me?

28:47.809 --> 28:49.227
I like punks like that.

28:49.936 --> 28:53.732
You can't survive in Narcotics
if you're here for its salary or pension.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.030
Did I keep you waiting?

29:42.655 --> 29:43.823
Yes.

29:45.825 --> 29:46.701
Have this.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.000
What is it?

29:54.584 --> 29:57.629
Chamomile tea. It's good for insomnia.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.381
I know you don't get much sleep.

30:07.263 --> 30:08.807
Why does it taste like makeup?

30:11.184 --> 30:13.144
I won't fall asleep. It's gross.

30:16.397 --> 30:18.149
How do you like being a cop?

30:23.154 --> 30:25.073
I'm being transferred to Narcotics.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.786
Now, it's starting for real.

30:33.873 --> 30:36.084
I can finally find the owner of the gun

30:38.044 --> 30:41.047
and what Cha Giho has to do with this.

30:42.382 --> 30:43.258
And

30:44.342 --> 30:45.802
I'll find out…

30:48.555 --> 30:49.806
who killed my dad.

30:56.646 --> 31:00.149
<i>My dad and I promised we'd build a house
on a beach and live there.</i>

31:02.193 --> 31:05.697
<i>We'd hang a hammock out front,
fish and swim every day</i>

31:05.780 --> 31:07.532
like people with nothing to do.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.453
He wanted to live like that…

31:20.712 --> 31:22.964
If he hadn't killed Dad…

31:27.260 --> 31:29.178
would I have been able to live like that?

31:37.729 --> 31:38.938
See that warehouse?

31:40.481 --> 31:42.025
About ten years ago,

31:42.108 --> 31:43.818
Donghoon saved my life there.

31:45.778 --> 31:48.990
Everyone was attacking us,
trying to swallow up our organization.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.712
Mujin!

32:17.894 --> 32:18.978
Hey.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.104
You lunatic.

32:21.314 --> 32:22.607
How did you find me?

32:24.275 --> 32:25.735
Shit.

32:25.818 --> 32:26.778
Hey.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.489
How can I leave you behind?

32:30.239 --> 32:31.282
-Get up.
-It hurts.

32:31.366 --> 32:32.867
-Get up.
-It hurts.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.002
Smile for the camera.

32:44.754 --> 32:46.673
-Will you be okay?
-We've gotten old.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.262
This is my knife.

32:59.185 --> 33:00.812
Kill him as soon as you find him.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.065
Trust me.

33:05.692 --> 33:08.319
No matter what happens,
the organization will protect you.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.019
See you later.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.900
Gosh, these police investigations…

33:47.984 --> 33:50.737
Hey, asshole! Answer my question!

33:50.820 --> 33:54.282
-Why are you swearing? You'll scare him.
-Is he allowed to do that?

33:54.365 --> 33:55.700
He's all shaken up now.

33:55.783 --> 33:57.201
Gosh.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.202
Changoo.

33:58.786 --> 34:02.123
Who cares about loyalty anymore?
Money is your boss, isn't it?

34:02.915 --> 34:03.750
Here.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.879
Give us five dealers and your boss.

34:10.173 --> 34:13.468
Your dad's turning 60 soon.
The youngest can't miss his celebration.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.428
-Write them down.
-But…

34:15.511 --> 34:18.514
Fucking forget it. There are
plenty of other assholes who'll talk.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.808
-Get up. You little…
-Wait! Hold on!

34:21.976 --> 34:23.019
Sir.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.607
I can't give up our boss.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.025
Asshole.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.943
You keep playing hard to get.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.531
Are you trying to date me?

34:41.496 --> 34:42.789
Something else.

34:44.832 --> 34:46.417
I'll give you something else.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.294
What?

34:49.879 --> 34:51.005
Are you mad?

34:51.672 --> 34:53.674
The candy in circulation lately…

35:10.024 --> 35:11.609
Do you know where it's from?

35:15.655 --> 35:17.365
CALL US ANYTIME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

35:17.448 --> 35:20.034
-You asshole. Are you trying to mess--
-Wait.

35:23.121 --> 35:23.955
Who is it?

35:25.957 --> 35:27.416
Mango.

35:30.920 --> 35:31.879
I'll be right back.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.090
INTERROGATION ROOM

35:34.173 --> 35:35.091
Hey.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.552
Do you keep in touch with Mango?

35:40.096 --> 35:41.013
Right.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.142
Find out where Mango is.
Hold on. Don't hang up.

35:45.601 --> 35:48.437
NARCOTICS TEAM 1

35:49.021 --> 35:50.022
Why are you here?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.402
Don't let anyone in, damn it.

35:56.863 --> 35:59.699
-Changoo is still under interrogation.
-I know that, sir.

36:00.491 --> 36:03.035
-Then, what is it?
-I was transferred here.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.745
Damn it.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.122
It's the narc.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.832
Stop the "narc."

36:08.416 --> 36:09.250
Damn it.

36:09.834 --> 36:10.668
Who's this?

36:11.335 --> 36:12.795
Corporal Oh, you're here.

36:13.379 --> 36:14.672
Go in. Come on.

36:14.755 --> 36:16.257
Captain. But…

36:17.425 --> 36:18.926
-That's your seat.
-I'll call you back.

36:19.010 --> 36:19.886
Yes, sir.

36:21.053 --> 36:21.888
What…

36:24.265 --> 36:26.309
Captain.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.270
You joined our team?

36:29.353 --> 36:30.354
What's going on?

36:30.438 --> 36:31.314
Your partner.

36:31.397 --> 36:35.151
I can't work with her.
Junho's leg hasn't even healed yet.

36:35.735 --> 36:39.197
That wasn't her fault.
You just clashed during an investigation.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.574
Exactly. It's a bad sign.

36:41.657 --> 36:42.867
That girl for my partner…

36:43.701 --> 36:45.620
Do you want me to carry her on my back?

36:46.329 --> 36:48.748
I took her in
because she's capable and tenacious.

36:48.831 --> 36:50.249
She wants to catch someone.

36:52.793 --> 36:53.836
Who doesn't?

36:55.087 --> 36:57.465
Keep an eye on her
and see whether she'll last.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.592
She won't last a month.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.093
Did you look into the candy?

37:03.262 --> 37:04.263
Yes.

37:04.347 --> 37:07.099
Changoo sang. He says Mango has it.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.392
Bring him in.

37:08.893 --> 37:09.727
Yes, sir.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.813
We don't have time. The boat came in.

37:21.405 --> 37:22.907
I can't log in.

37:22.990 --> 37:26.118
Our system is different,
so you need to be registered.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.787
Why do you want to log in?

37:28.955 --> 37:31.082
I need to know
the status of the investigation.

37:31.624 --> 37:34.043
I see. The status of the investigation.

37:34.543 --> 37:37.964
The status of the six-month undercover
investigation that some idiot ruined?

37:40.007 --> 37:41.467
I'm sorry about that.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.261
I'll get you registered.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.222
Why bother? She won't last long.

37:49.642 --> 37:51.060
What should I do?

37:54.355 --> 37:55.564
I don't know.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.234
What should I do with you?

38:06.075 --> 38:07.285
Hey.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.328
There?

38:10.162 --> 38:11.038
Got it.

38:12.790 --> 38:13.624
Let's go.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.252
-What?
-Let's work.

38:17.211 --> 38:18.212
Mango.

38:26.429 --> 38:30.933
DEAD BODY OF BAE JUNGOO
CRIME SCENE PHOTOS

38:31.017 --> 38:32.685
SUICIDE NOTE FOUND WITH BODY

38:32.768 --> 38:35.062
MY DEAR WIFE AND DAUGHTER
I'M SORRY FOR LEAVING YOU

38:43.696 --> 38:44.739
This is Cha Giho.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.701
I believe Choi Mujin
will make his move soon.

39:01.714 --> 39:04.425
Yamamoto wants to make a deal.

39:06.677 --> 39:08.137
How big?

39:08.220 --> 39:10.514
The first transaction
will be 50 billion won.

39:13.851 --> 39:14.852
Should I refuse?

39:15.686 --> 39:18.606
It will be a problem
if we can't keep up with demand.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.984
They found Mr. Bae.

39:24.653 --> 39:26.614
I'll go personally next week.

39:30.409 --> 39:32.036
I haven't seen that tumbler before.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.705
It's chamomile tea.

39:36.457 --> 39:37.958
Chamomile tea?

39:39.210 --> 39:40.628
Good work, Ms. Kang.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.725
Jiwoo joined Narcotics.

39:56.352 --> 39:57.853
It'll help the organization.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.898
Do you trust her?

40:03.359 --> 40:04.652
I don't trust her.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.489
I trust her desperation.

40:10.699 --> 40:12.535
Jiwoo will become our dagger.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.037
If things go south,
we'll have to kill her.

40:19.792 --> 40:20.835
Yes, we will.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.065
Gosh. I can't stand it.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.651
Just my damn luck.

40:49.947 --> 40:52.158
The owner goes by "Mango."

40:52.741 --> 40:53.826
Go bring him out.

40:56.954 --> 40:57.955
What's the charge?

40:58.497 --> 41:01.459
There's no need to read him his rights.
Just bring him.

41:03.419 --> 41:04.378
Go.

41:09.675 --> 41:10.759
Damn it…

41:23.314 --> 41:24.732
Excuse me, who are you?

41:26.567 --> 41:28.110
I'm here to see the boss.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.154
I see.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.448
Are you his new girl?

41:34.408 --> 41:35.910
That's not my thing.

41:38.037 --> 41:38.954
Where's Mango?

41:39.038 --> 41:40.247
He's not here. Leave.

41:41.248 --> 41:43.459
-Keep your hands to yourself.
-Just go--

41:49.548 --> 41:50.966
Hey. Get out.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.059
<i>Pildo. Did the rookie go in?</i>

42:00.142 --> 42:03.437
Yes. Mango will run out holding the drugs.
Get ready.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.294
Who are you? Damn it…

42:48.315 --> 42:50.359
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

42:50.901 --> 42:51.944
<i>How long has it been?</i>

42:53.946 --> 42:54.822
Let's go in.

43:24.226 --> 43:25.311
What the…

43:25.394 --> 43:26.353
What…

43:26.437 --> 43:27.896
What in the…

43:28.731 --> 43:30.733
Is he dead? Pildo.

43:48.375 --> 43:50.210
Hey, my arm! My arm!

43:54.131 --> 43:55.591
My arm!

43:55.674 --> 43:56.508
Shit!

44:52.648 --> 44:57.653
