Computer:<i> Attention.</i>

10:01.977 --> 10:03.727
<i> Incoming message</i>
<i> from mission control.</i>

10:03.812 --> 10:05.228
Incoming message! Guys!

10:05.355 --> 10:09.524
Stand by for rules briefing
with mission director shatner.

10:09.568 --> 10:12.027
Hello, mars crew.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.361
- Hey!
- Hey, he's here!

10:13.405 --> 10:16.615
( cheering )

10:16.658 --> 10:19.117
Look at all of you. So excited.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.493
How's it going so far?

10:20.537 --> 10:21.286
- Great.
- Awesome.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.078
Good. It's good.

10:22.331 --> 10:24.873
Just kidding.
I can't hear you.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.291
There's currently
a 17-minute delay

10:26.335 --> 10:31.338
Between your base and me
on earth in mission control.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.089
Chris:<i> It is mind-blowing</i>
<i> to see william shatner.</i>

10:33.133 --> 10:35.550
He is the original space boy.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.303
<i>It's pretty surreal to have him</i>
<i> a part of this experiment.</i>

10:38.305 --> 10:43.350
You have to listen to me
very closely.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.977
There are not enough rations
for everyone.

10:46.021 --> 10:49.397
Those not critical
to the mars simulation
will be extracted.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.149
Mm-mm.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.318
Sent home every 48 hours.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.321
The most powerful role
on your crew

10:56.365 --> 10:58.031
Will be the base commander.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.366
They're in charge.

10:59.409 --> 11:03.203
They will assign tasks
and duties around the hab.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.830
And when emergency strikes,
and it will,

11:05.832 --> 11:09.417
They'll lead you on missions
necessary for your survival.

11:09.461 --> 11:13.421
Crucially, your base commander
will help to determine

11:13.465 --> 11:17.926
Who is or isn't
mission critical.

11:17.969 --> 11:22.681
You must choose
your base commander
for the first 48 hours now.

11:22.724 --> 11:28.353
Choose wisely. The hopes
of celebrities everywhere
rests on your shoulders.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.230
Celebrities.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.401
- He looks amazing for his age.
- He really does.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.278
Computer:
<i> You have two minutes to</i>
<i> select your base commander.</i>

11:37.322 --> 11:41.533
<i> Your base commander</i>
<i> will be your leader</i>
<i> for the next two days.</i>

11:41.576 --> 11:43.827
Who-- does anybody want
to be the commander?

11:43.870 --> 11:47.706
Right now I think everybody's
just figuring out their footing

11:47.708 --> 11:48.790
<i> And we're shaping</i>
<i> each other up</i>

11:49.084 --> 11:52.627
<i> Just to see how are we best</i>
<i> gonna work together?</i>

11:52.713 --> 11:57.090
Did anyone wanna be
the first base commander?
Absolutely not.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.050
- No, no, no--
- I elect--

11:59.094 --> 12:01.886
- Yes. The next two days.
- Two days?

12:01.930 --> 12:04.013
- You got it, champ.
- I-- no.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.474
It's gonna be
really awkward if I fail.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.935
You never think about failing.
You only think about succeeding.

12:09.020 --> 12:12.230
My biggest fear is failure.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.275
- What about lance?
- No, I'm going outside.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.484
( muted chatter )

12:16.778 --> 12:20.113
Computer:<i> The base commander</i>
<i> will have exclusive use</i>

12:20.157 --> 12:22.490
<i>Of their own sleeping quarters.</i>

12:22.534 --> 12:25.285
( cheers and applause )

12:25.328 --> 12:27.996
- Shawn, you're base commander.
- I don't know how to delegate.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.122
Shawn's base commander.
Perfect.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.166
- Okay, shawn.
- ( cheering )

12:31.209 --> 12:33.460
- Really?
- Let's go, champ.

12:33.462 --> 12:35.211
Marshawn:
<i> Being the base commander,</i>

12:35.297 --> 12:38.590
I get my own little luxury
sleeping situation,

12:38.633 --> 12:40.458
<i> So I'm good with that.</i>

12:40.460 --> 12:42.969
Ay, ay, ay, ay,
ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

12:43.013 --> 12:46.723
<i> Commander,</i>
<i> your first mission starts now.</i>

12:46.725 --> 12:47.974
<i> There is a 12th crew member</i>

12:48.059 --> 12:50.351
<i> Trapped in a pod</i>
<i> with dwindling oxygen.</i>

12:50.395 --> 12:52.228
<i> Choose two crew members.</i>

12:52.272 --> 12:55.523
<i> Their mission is to rescue</i>
<i> your stranded crewmate.</i>

12:55.567 --> 12:56.941
Aww. Like, damn.

12:56.985 --> 13:00.320
I guess it's time
to take care of business.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.238
So, look, this is what's up.

13:02.282 --> 13:06.201
Lance and ronda,
I need y'all to partner up.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.244
They couldn't land
their ( bleep ) correctly,

13:08.288 --> 13:10.079
And we gotta go rescue 'em.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.915
I'm gonna need y'all
to go and get 'em,

13:11.958 --> 13:13.166
You feel what
I'm talking about?

13:13.168 --> 13:16.586
- ( alarm blaring )
- ( all shouting )

13:16.630 --> 13:19.923
<i> Oxygen levels in</i>

13:19.966 --> 13:22.342

All right, get 'em dressed.
Get 'em dressed.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.222
Suit 'em up!

13:27.224 --> 13:29.265
Good job, adam. Good.
There you go, baby.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.893
Marshawn:<i> We gotta send</i>
<i> a team out there.</i>

<i> Lance and ronda are out</i>
<i>rescuing your 12th crew member.</i>

13:51.164 --> 13:53.623

13:58.964 --> 14:02.465
This ( bleep ) wanted
to hear espn.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.467

- Oh, oh. Excuse me.
- Are y'all okay?

14:11.393 --> 14:13.935
- Hey, lance.
- Oh, my god.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.979
Marshawn, are you there?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.063
Why do they look like that?

14:17.065 --> 14:19.482
Oh, my god, no.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.109
- I don't want this
close to my face.
- That's real close!

14:21.152 --> 14:24.529
- Oh, it's about to be
this close for us.
- Marshawn: Hey, lance.

14:26.283 --> 14:29.033
- Marshawn.
-<i> Hey, can you hear me, bro?</i>

14:29.077 --> 14:32.412
- I just wanna make sure
you're behaving.
- Ay.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.289
I think we go
through here, right?

14:34.374 --> 14:38.084
Oh, my god.
It looks like mars.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.421
Is that what it looks like
outside right now?

14:41.464 --> 14:45.049
- Lance: There we go.
- There she is.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.265
- Looky here.
- It's an alien!

14:52.267 --> 14:54.225
Hey.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.227
Oh, wait, there's a person.
There's a person!

14:58.398 --> 14:59.480
Oh, ( bleep ).

15:01.693 --> 15:03.100
- Slide down.
- Slide.

15:03.102 --> 15:06.321
- ( gasps )
- she's still alive!

15:06.364 --> 15:08.865

15:08.867 --> 15:12.035
- Who is it?
- Ronda: Get her other hand.
Get her other hand.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.912
- Natasha!
- Who?

15:13.955 --> 15:15.955
Leggero. She's a comedian.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.874
- Petey?
- Comedian.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.084
What did you think I said,
a "pedian?"

15:25.133 --> 15:27.926
- ( indistinct chatter )
- ( cheering )

I can cook a chicken.

- Tasha? I'm tom.
Nice to meet you.
- Yes. Hi, tom.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.910
Computer:
<i> Mission successful.</i>

15:53.954 --> 15:56.320
<i> All crew are now</i>

<i> You are 140 million miles</i>

<i> Marshawn, you can find</i>

16:03.296 --> 16:05.463
<i> On the base commander console.</i>

16:05.507 --> 16:08.174
<i> You must assign them</i>

<i> You are responsible</i>
<i> for maintaining</i>

16:09.928 --> 16:11.302
<i> Your ration inventory.</i>

16:11.304 --> 16:14.514
All right, so look,
porsha and tallulah,

16:14.557 --> 16:19.185
What y'all gotta do is
y'all gotta count and categorize
the food and rations.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.269
Okay, we can do that.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.064
<i> There will be no resupply.</i>

16:23.108 --> 16:26.025
<i> You must maintain</i>
<i> the bio dome crops.</i>

16:26.069 --> 16:29.237
Chris and sherm,
y'all gonna have to go do the
same ( bleep ) with the plants.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.947
- Gotcha, gotcha.
- You feel me?

16:30.949 --> 16:34.951
<i> You experience 66.2% less</i>
<i> gravity on mars.</i>

16:34.995 --> 16:36.703
<i> You must maintain fitness</i>

16:36.705 --> 16:40.289
<i>To prevent bone and muscle loss</i>
<i> in this experiment.</i>

16:40.333 --> 16:43.751
To conclude this,
I am iyd commander,

16:43.795 --> 16:46.921
And if y'all need me,
just give me a "hootie-hoo"

16:46.965 --> 16:48.923
- Or a "ye," and I will be--
- like a...

16:48.967 --> 16:51.843
- All: Hootie-hoo!
- Ye!

16:51.886 --> 16:56.097
Marshawn is base commander?
Okay. Y'all play too much.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.516
Because how is he gonna
get all of us into formation

16:58.560 --> 17:00.518
When he's never in formation?

17:03.064 --> 17:05.148
Base commander...

17:06.192 --> 17:07.525
...Reporting for duty.

17:09.696 --> 17:13.239
<i> ( music playing )</i>

Marshawn:
<i> The benefit to being</i>
<i> a base commander</i>

17:19.497 --> 17:23.374
Is I got my own little bed,
got my own little bathroom.

17:26.454 --> 17:27.628
I can dig it.

17:27.672 --> 17:28.629
( sighs )

17:28.882 --> 17:31.466
Computer:<i> Marshawn,</i>
<i> as base commander,</i>

17:31.509 --> 17:33.634
<i> You must oversee</i>

17:36.598 --> 17:38.181
<i> Marshawn.</i>

17:38.183 --> 17:41.517
- Okay, what is that?
- Ten cornflakes.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.977
Ten cornflakes.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.437
When you first walk
in the kitchen,

17:44.439 --> 17:45.772
It's like,
"yeah, it's got a kitchen!
Got everything!"

17:45.899 --> 17:49.859
No! We don't have a stove.
We don't have an air fryer.

17:49.861 --> 17:53.863
And we have a lot of food
that is air-sealed in bags.

17:53.907 --> 17:57.366
So, one, two, three.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.577
Which one did you
just take that from?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.537
- And so this--
- let's not count that.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.663
<i> ( music playing )</i>

18:02.665 --> 18:05.541

18:12.258 --> 18:13.341
Richard:
<i> We don't have enough rations</i>

18:13.343 --> 18:15.176
To last as long
as we need them to last,

18:15.220 --> 18:17.887
So it's really cool
that we're growing stuff.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.722
Chris:
Two tangerine trees.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.183
<i> At home, I've been known</i>
<i> to kill all my plants,</i>

18:22.185 --> 18:24.268
<i> So that was</i>
<i> a very rough start for me.</i>

18:24.270 --> 18:28.022
But ya gotta do the mundane
tasks to survive on mars.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.190
Tell us what
you think these are.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.858
- Um, olives.
- Mm.

18:30.902 --> 18:33.361
- Ah-ah. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

18:33.404 --> 18:36.239
- Here, I'll get them.
- Thank you.
I cannot reach that.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.367
So marshawn has given me
and adam the task

18:39.410 --> 18:44.038
-<i> Of polishing the patches. </i>
- Whoa!

18:44.124 --> 18:46.207
We hate to see it, you know?

18:46.209 --> 18:48.751
I'm assuming that the patches

18:48.795 --> 18:51.587
<i> Are something that people</i>
<i> in this simulation</i>

18:51.631 --> 18:53.923
<i> Might earn on a mission.</i>

18:53.967 --> 18:56.676
- I actually love cleaning
and organizing so much.
- Me, too!

18:56.719 --> 18:58.052
Do you like folding things?

18:58.096 --> 18:59.887
Yes, I love folding my laundry.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.389
- I love it.
- It's awesome.

19:01.432 --> 19:04.058
- All of my things

- same.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.852
- Yeah, okay.
- Same. I love this for us.

Shut up.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.994
No--

19:23.037 --> 19:27.290
Cycling is a--
that's an athletic thing?

19:27.333 --> 19:30.251
You know, my sporting career
started 30 years ago,

19:30.253 --> 19:32.420
And so some folks
might know me from that.

19:32.463 --> 19:37.175
They might know me
from having just lived a very
complicated public life.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.218
<i> But I come from</i>
<i> an endurance sport,</i>

19:39.262 --> 19:42.930
And to me, this entire endeavor,
that's all about endurance.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.224
- How long is that race?
- Three weeks.

19:48.229 --> 19:51.814
Yeah, I'm thinking you're
gonna say, like, 50 miles.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.891
You know what the average length
of a football play is

19:53.902 --> 19:56.360
From the time they say,
"down, set, hut,"

19:56.404 --> 19:58.446
To the time the ref blows
the whistle?

19:58.448 --> 20:01.032
- Seven seconds.
- Seven seconds.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.241
Who's the ( bleep ) athlete now?

20:02.243 --> 20:05.369
Man, just 'cause you ride
a ( bleep ) bike

20:05.413 --> 20:09.498
For three weeks,
like, how athletic is this?

20:11.252 --> 20:12.752
- Shatner:<i> Coming up... </i>
- ( alarm blaring )

20:12.795 --> 20:15.588
- Emergency!
- Okay, look,
y'all gotta listen.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.132
<i> If we don't hurry up,</i>
<i> we gonna miss the orbit.</i>

20:18.176 --> 20:20.218
I'm standing here

20:20.261 --> 20:23.346
Time is of the assess--
of the, uh, essence.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.473
The name of game,
someone has to go home.

20:25.516 --> 20:29.518
Are you guys ready to see
who is mission critical?

20:43.326 --> 20:47.245
Marshawn: Nah, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.080
- Can I get y'all for a second?
- Yes.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.874
All right, what's up?

20:52.669 --> 20:54.961
This was our first day on mars.

20:54.963 --> 20:58.005
Richard:
<i> I cannot believe I'm here.</i>

20:58.049 --> 21:02.426
I'm in a spacesuit on mars
led by marshawn.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.888
The job is well done
on the first day for the tasks,

21:05.932 --> 21:08.307
So give y'all self
a round of applause.

21:08.351 --> 21:11.352
I will say we did a good job.
We came together. You feel me?

21:11.354 --> 21:13.437
We was able to accomplish
some ( bleep ).

21:15.483 --> 21:17.775
And then we got sherman
and chris.

21:17.819 --> 21:21.070
They took care
of the plants and the farms
and all that ( bleep ).

21:21.114 --> 21:24.365
- We got 14 blueberry
plants in there, guys.
- 18 olives.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.284
Chris:
<i> Marshawn is a wildcard.</i>

21:26.327 --> 21:29.120
You don't know
what he's gonna say.
He's an incredible commander.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.371
I think you did a good job, iyd.

21:30.415 --> 21:34.333
- What's iyd?
- I'm your daddy. Ay.

21:34.335 --> 21:37.211
How am I supposed to be
the comedian with you around?

21:37.213 --> 21:39.380
I think we're all still trying
to read each other out,

21:39.424 --> 21:41.924
And we're trying to figure out
what are the strengths,

21:41.968 --> 21:43.718
What are the weakness
of everyone?

21:43.720 --> 21:45.052
<i> How are we best</i>
<i> gonna work together?</i>

21:45.471 --> 21:48.347
Which is gonna be
really important the longer
that we stay here.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.968
Ariel:
<i> I work out maybe, like,</i>

21:52.970 --> 21:54.562
I'm gonna say 50 times
a whole year.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.147
- So, you know--
- hey, that's a lot.

21:56.566 --> 22:01.193
Previous experiments have failed
because people socially
and mentally crack,

22:01.237 --> 22:03.362
<i> And I feel like</i>
<i> the social aspect</i>

22:03.364 --> 22:05.114
<i> Is more important</i>
<i> than anything</i>

22:05.199 --> 22:06.449
Because as human beings,

22:06.492 --> 22:10.411
That's kind of our strength
and our weakness.

22:10.455 --> 22:13.122
Tallulah, your parents
are these amazing people

22:13.166 --> 22:14.457
That have achieved
all these amazing things.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.752
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Do you have any advice
for me for my daughter?

22:17.795 --> 22:19.920
- Oh, my gosh.
- How to help her through
that experience

22:19.964 --> 22:21.464
Or how that affected you?

22:21.466 --> 22:24.925
Yeah, I mean,
I grew up in idaho.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.303
And I knew my parents
had this job

22:27.347 --> 22:31.057
That made them this thing,
and we got to do cool stuff,

22:31.100 --> 22:33.184
But I didn't fully understand.

22:33.227 --> 22:36.270
The only thing that I knew
about tallulah coming in here

22:36.314 --> 22:40.191
Was she has two
extremely famous parents--

22:40.234 --> 22:42.568
Demi moore and bruce willis,

22:42.570 --> 22:46.947
<i> And tallulah is</i>
<i> the quintessential nepo baby.</i>

22:46.991 --> 22:49.075
So, yeah, she should own it.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.202
It was, like, 2003.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.162
My mom had just started
dating ashton.

22:53.206 --> 22:56.957
It was that moment.
There was a lot going on.

22:57.001 --> 23:00.002
And I really went inside
of myself.

23:00.046 --> 23:05.007
And that did send me
into a total dumpster fire.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.343
It was really hard,
and I'm still unpacking.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.470
However, I found
the other side of that,

23:09.472 --> 23:13.391
Which is I really
love myself now...

23:13.434 --> 23:15.267
- As you should.
- ...And my family.

23:15.269 --> 23:17.019
Yeah, and I love my family.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.022
There's not a lot of people
that deal with that.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.733
<i> So she's one of the ones</i>
<i> I was, you know,</i>
<i> more concerned about</i>

23:22.735 --> 23:24.360
<i> And someone I was thinking</i>
<i> of like, oh, my god,</i>

23:24.404 --> 23:26.362
<i> We need to make sure</i>
<i> she's taken care of.</i>

23:28.950 --> 23:29.990
Are you married?

23:30.034 --> 23:31.367
Uh-huh.
I have a five-year-old.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.119
Aww! I have a four-year-old.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.954
You do?
Isn't that the cutest age?

23:34.997 --> 23:36.247
Yes! Oh, my god.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.666
Natasha:<i> I think friendship</i>
<i> is the most important thing,</i>

23:38.709 --> 23:42.128
So I was connecting with porsha
because I think that

23:42.130 --> 23:43.337
She and I have a similar--

23:43.381 --> 23:45.339
You know, our kids
are the same age.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.675
And you have one daughter
and then two stepsons?

23:47.677 --> 23:48.717
No, my husband has five kids.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.554
- Oh, wow. Oh, my god.
- Is that your ring? Damn.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.055
- Yeah.
- It's insane.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.307
- That's a space rock
right there.
- Thank you.

23:55.351 --> 23:59.645
I would raise five stepkids
for that ring, sure.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.357
Lance:<i> How many super bowl</i>
<i> wins you got?</i>

24:03.401 --> 24:04.567
I only got one.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.653
- Just one? What?
- One loss, one win.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.322
Lance:<i> I think it's important</i>
<i> to make friends here.</i>

24:10.366 --> 24:13.451
<i>The first question is who wants</i>
<i> to be here till the end?</i>

24:13.453 --> 24:17.121
Marshawn is one of the toughest
humans on the planet.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.165
<i> He's certainly not</i>
<i> in any hurry to leave.</i>

24:19.167 --> 24:22.251
Now, going back to something
very serious.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.295
- Can I borrow your bathroom?
- Hell, naw.

24:24.338 --> 24:28.257
Please!
I don't know that I can go
in the public thing.

24:30.011 --> 24:32.386
I'm a little weirded out
by being in a bunk room

24:32.430 --> 24:35.639
With six other dudes
and sharing a bathroom
and sharing showers.

24:35.683 --> 24:36.557
<i> But time is of the essence.</i>

24:36.851 --> 24:38.184
Nah, you can't ( bleep )
in there, brother.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.437
- 100%?
- 100,000.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.564
All right,
I'll be right back.

24:45.526 --> 24:47.067
He still moves well.

24:47.403 --> 24:50.112
Marshawn:<i> Look like</i>
<i> he eating lima beans</i>
<i> and ( bleep ) like that,</i>

24:50.156 --> 24:53.324
So there will not be
no ( bleep ) lima bean

24:53.367 --> 24:55.159
( bleep ) in my bathroom.

24:59.165 --> 25:04.376
So I just realized
I made a huge mistake.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.129
- So who did you think he was?
- Neil armstrong.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.132
- I'm not kidding.
- Oh, yeah.
Foot in mouth syndrome?

25:10.176 --> 25:13.219
- She thought he was
an actual astronaut.
- I mean, it's funny.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.471
That was part of my fear
coming on the show

25:15.515 --> 25:17.264
Was I was gonna
say something stupid,

25:17.308 --> 25:21.477
And I literally--
like, I outdid myself.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.230
Don't take yourself
too seriously.

25:28.069 --> 25:29.902
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

25:29.904 --> 25:32.446
Commander signing off.

25:32.490 --> 25:33.531
( laughs )

25:33.574 --> 25:35.658
Good night, lance.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.235
So far, I don't think we've
really started to test
ourselves, right?

25:38.246 --> 25:42.081
<i> Living in a confined space</i>
<i> for weeks on end,</i>

25:42.083 --> 25:45.125
I think that's where this thing
will start to unravel.

25:45.169 --> 25:48.754
Natasha:
<i>You know, I really have no idea</i>
<i> what's in store for me,</i>

25:48.798 --> 25:50.965
But, I mean, what could really
prepare you for mars?

25:51.008 --> 25:53.133
<i> I don't know.</i>

26:01.727 --> 26:04.853
( alarm blaring )

26:04.897 --> 26:06.605
Emergency!

26:11.028 --> 26:12.319
Shatner:<i> Coming up...</i>

26:12.321 --> 26:14.154
- Whoa.
- Oh, my god.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.740
The solar winds, man.
This is crazy!

26:16.784 --> 26:20.327
I think a lot of us
would have died
if this was really mars.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.663
- I can't muscle it.
- Aah!

26:28.588 --> 26:31.171
Computer:<i> All crew,</i>
<i> report to the command center.</i>

26:31.215 --> 26:33.882
- Emergency!
-<i> Like astronauts on mars,</i>

26:33.926 --> 26:35.050
<i> You will deal</i>
<i> with constant emergencies.</i>

26:35.294 --> 26:38.012
- Wake up!
- Richard: Come on, shawn!
Emergency!

26:38.055 --> 26:40.389
- Emergency!
- Here we go.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.475
- ( yawns )
- here we go.

26:43.477 --> 26:47.855
- Hello, mars crew.
- Guys, it's shatty daddy.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.607
We have an emergency.

26:49.650 --> 26:53.110
A fierce martian dust storm
is headed your way

26:53.154 --> 26:54.153
And has already knocked over

26:54.196 --> 26:56.071
The communication
satellite tower.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.157
If you fail today,
earth will be destroyed.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.617
Huh?

27:01.412 --> 27:02.536
I read that wrong.

27:02.788 --> 27:07.249
Your link between mars
and earth will be destroyed.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.500
Still a pretty big deal.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.921
This mission will test
your leadership skills

27:12.923 --> 27:17.051
And will earn you
a mission patch.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.344
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

27:18.429 --> 27:19.845
The badges.

27:19.889 --> 27:21.722
I'm downloading
all of the information

27:21.766 --> 27:24.183
For your base commander now.

27:24.226 --> 27:27.895
Tallulah is
your mission specialist.

27:27.938 --> 27:30.356
- Ah!
- This is an important role,

27:30.399 --> 27:33.192
As the mission specialist
is safe from extraction.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.235
- Tallulah?
- Oh!

27:35.237 --> 27:38.947
Good luck, and remember,
if you need anything at all,

27:38.991 --> 27:43.077
Anything,
you're completely on your own.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.987
- ( laughter )
- ( cheering )

27:45.998 --> 27:48.165
We got your back!

27:48.209 --> 27:50.167
I got chosen
for mission specialist,

27:50.211 --> 27:52.336
Which is very exciting.

27:52.338 --> 27:55.172
Computer:<i> Base commander</i>
<i> and mission specialist,</i>

27:55.216 --> 27:57.383
<i> Remain at mission control.</i>

27:57.426 --> 28:00.552
<i> Crew, prepare for deployment.</i>

28:00.596 --> 28:02.179
- Let's get it!
- Energy!

28:02.223 --> 28:05.099
I know there's gonna be
a lot of ( bleep ) going on.

28:05.101 --> 28:07.851
<i> So if we get to a point</i>
<i> where it's too much,</i>

28:07.895 --> 28:10.688
<i> Don't be afraid to let me know</i>
<i> and I'll jump in there.</i>

28:10.731 --> 28:12.231
- Okay.
- But just remember,

28:12.274 --> 28:14.316
<i> At the end of the day,</i>
<i> all things fall back on me...</i>

28:14.360 --> 28:16.193
Let's save this satellite.

28:16.237 --> 28:19.363
...And I feel right now I'm
gonna be a reflection of you.

28:19.407 --> 28:20.614
So make us both look good.

28:20.950 --> 28:25.119
We are going to support our crew
getting that tower back up,

28:25.162 --> 28:27.037
And in emergencies, we rally.

28:27.081 --> 28:29.957
- One, two, three.
- Iyd!

28:29.959 --> 28:32.042
- There we go.
- ( cheering )

28:32.044 --> 28:33.919
Going out there
to kick martian ass.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.088
- This door?
- Hey, louis armstrong!

28:36.132 --> 28:37.673
I got your back, boy!

28:37.717 --> 28:39.341
( laughs )

28:41.387 --> 28:42.803
Tallulah:
<i> Can you guys hear me?</i>

28:42.847 --> 28:43.595
- Yep.
- Yeah.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.222
Okay, so here's
the mission brief.

28:45.266 --> 28:49.476
<i> We need our crew to find</i>
<i> three satellite dishes</i>

28:49.520 --> 28:51.019
<i> And two antenna pieces</i>

28:51.063 --> 28:52.938
<i> And then successfully</i>
<i> put back up</i>

28:52.940 --> 28:54.440
<i> The fallen comms tower</i>

28:54.442 --> 28:56.608
<i> Before the communication</i>
<i> window closes</i>

28:56.652 --> 28:59.403
<i> And the mars orbiter misses</i>
<i> the ecliptic plane.</i>

28:59.447 --> 29:00.487
Copy that.

29:00.531 --> 29:02.197
Adam:<i> I'm panicked</i>
<i> out of my mind,</i>

29:02.241 --> 29:05.033
But we also know that
the name of the game

29:05.077 --> 29:07.494
Is that someone has to go home.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.330
Chris:
<i> I'm very nervous I'm not gonna</i>
<i> be able to carry my weight.</i>

29:10.332 --> 29:12.875
This is not gonna go well.

29:12.918 --> 29:16.044
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

29:18.716 --> 29:20.048
Wow.

29:21.635 --> 29:25.053
- Whoa.
- Oh, my god.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.388
Natasha:
<i> I'm having a hard time</i>

29:26.390 --> 29:29.641
<i> Doing anything other than,</i>
<i> you know, breathing.</i>

29:29.643 --> 29:34.229
So I don't really think
I would make it as an astronaut.

29:35.983 --> 29:40.611
Okay, so can we have lance,
ronda, and ariel

29:40.654 --> 29:42.446
<i> Try to find the two rovers</i>

29:42.448 --> 29:45.866
<i> And turn the lights on</i>
<i> to illuminate the area?</i>

29:45.910 --> 29:47.367
- Ariel: Got it.
- Here's the rover.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.995
- Hey! Ariel!
- Oh, good. All right.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.080
So the rest of the crew,
you're gonna start to look

29:52.124 --> 29:54.416
<i> For all the broken</i>
<i> satellite components</i>

29:54.460 --> 29:56.210
And the antennas
to the tower.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.921
<i> Please note that there are</i>
<i> three satellite dishes</i>

29:58.964 --> 30:01.089
<i> And two antennas to repair.</i>

30:01.133 --> 30:04.009
- I got an antenna.
- Who is this talking?

30:04.094 --> 30:07.054
I'm gonna need you to
identify yourself, gangsta.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.222
Look!
Right here, right here!

30:08.265 --> 30:10.891
I don't know
who the hell designed this,

30:10.976 --> 30:14.228
But this is really realistic.

30:14.230 --> 30:16.855
<i> It was pitch black</i>
<i> and there was, like, wind.</i>

30:16.899 --> 30:19.733
<i> Then I realized</i>
<i> I couldn't breathe,</i>
<i> that it was sand.</i>

30:19.777 --> 30:23.987
I'm definitely adding astronaut
to my bio on instagram.

30:24.031 --> 30:25.364
We found the other one!

30:25.407 --> 30:26.657
- Nice!
- Yes.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.033
I've located a satellite dish.

30:28.035 --> 30:31.078
- Is that tinashe?
- Yeah.

30:31.121 --> 30:33.163
You think we attach
this on the other side?

30:33.165 --> 30:36.291
- Yellow parts for here.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.211
I've never been to mars.
I don't know
what's going on here.

30:39.213 --> 30:40.838
<i> This is not what</i>

30:40.840 --> 30:43.674
- I thought we had two of them.
- I can't hear you, chris.

30:43.676 --> 30:45.342
Remember,
that's three satellites.

30:45.386 --> 30:49.388
All right, we're almost there.
Hold it. Is it straight?

30:49.431 --> 30:51.557
Almost there.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.392
We did it!
We got this one!

30:53.435 --> 30:55.435
Computer:
<i> Antenna one attached.</i>

30:55.479 --> 30:57.104
All right,
let's do the second one.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.471
- Marshawn:<i> Hey, sherm. </i>
- What up?

30:58.482 --> 31:00.941
How many people
is it actually gonna take

31:00.985 --> 31:03.610
To get that one satellite
put together?

31:03.654 --> 31:05.404
I can't hear you, shawn,
when everybody's talking.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.656
It's chaos.
Everybody's talking
at the same time,

31:07.700 --> 31:09.324
<i> And communication is critical.</i>

31:09.410 --> 31:11.994
<i> And I think marshawn kinda</i>
<i> dropped the ball on that.</i>

31:12.037 --> 31:15.247
We got it.
All right, we got two up.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.249
You got it?
Okay, there you go.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.420
All right, I'm attaching
satellite one!

31:21.463 --> 31:22.963
I got it.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.631
Hey, look,
we got three minutes left.

31:26.093 --> 31:27.134
That's good.

31:28.429 --> 31:30.137

- What happened to that one?

You gotta just give us
a little something here.

Do you know what a winch is?

32:39.500 --> 32:43.210
If it's anything like a wrench,
then we are--

32:43.253 --> 32:45.337
- You can get there?
We're good to go?
- Yeah.

32:45.381 --> 32:47.297
- Where is the winch?
- What are we looking for?

32:47.341 --> 32:49.675
I'm looking for where
to secure the winch.

32:49.677 --> 32:51.009
- What?
- The winch.

32:51.053 --> 32:54.096
- Where is the winch?
- It's a ring.

Ariel, you're doing

33:04.942 --> 33:07.317
- A little more!
Two more feet!
- More slack.

33:07.319 --> 33:11.446
Me and tom are trying
to connect these two clips.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.825

- We're so close!
- Oh, so close! Almost there!

33:19.039 --> 33:20.622
We're literally inches away.

33:20.666 --> 33:23.291
Oh, it's moving! It's moving!

33:23.335 --> 33:25.419

- Are we pulling the winch or
are we pushing the tower?

34:06.628 --> 34:08.253
Lift this?

34:08.297 --> 34:09.796
What the--
what are you talking about?

34:09.840 --> 34:11.006
How are we supposed
to lift the tower?

34:11.341 --> 34:12.132
- Let's get it!
- Wait, we're not
going to lift it yet.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.677
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Hey, shawn. Hey, shawn.

34:17.473 --> 34:18.680

- Where do I go?

That was incredible!
- Yeah!

- So proud of you all.
- Chris: Thank you, tallulah.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.576
Tallulah, you should be
a motivational speaker.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.037
- Whoo!
- Ay, ay.

35:24.081 --> 35:29.000
That's what I'm saying.
I was pleased to have you
as my copilot.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.545
It was an honor
to serve with you.

- Crazy.

Ugh, that tested everybody.

Oh, shatty daddy!

36:09.960 --> 36:11.459
It's time for a tough decision.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.254
One of your crewmates

Good luck.

Computer:<i> Base commander,</i>
<i> you must decide</i>

36:28.437 --> 36:32.147
- Damn.
- Are you kidding?

36:32.182 --> 36:36.860
As far as individuals
who was mission critical,

36:36.904 --> 36:41.406
You know, porsha was engaged in
the things that were going on.

36:41.450 --> 36:44.451
Yeah, and ariel felt like
she was very mission critical.

36:44.486 --> 36:47.204
Marshawn:<i> Oh, she was</i>
<i> very mission critical.</i>

36:47.247 --> 36:50.123
And then you have
the individuals

36:50.167 --> 36:53.418
Who had to reach out
a couple of times

36:53.462 --> 36:57.130
And we wasn't getting
a response back.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.592
- Let's do it.
- For sure.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.223
All: Ay!

37:06.266 --> 37:09.267
Y'all did a hell of a job
out there on the mission.

37:09.311 --> 37:11.186
It was all worth it
to hear that.

37:11.230 --> 37:15.482
Right on, right on, right on.
But now we get to the hard part.

37:16.985 --> 37:21.196
So this is
who was mission critical.

37:22.699 --> 37:27.369
Who was mission critical?
Um, besides myself.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.330
So I will need porsha.

37:30.374 --> 37:32.249
-<i> You're mission critical. </i>
- ( overlapping chatter )

37:32.292 --> 37:34.334
- Porsha!
- Big crit.

37:34.378 --> 37:36.253
- Yes, porsha!
- Critical!

37:36.255 --> 37:39.965
Porsha, you looking
dirty as hell, girl.

- Yep.

38:06.410 --> 38:09.202
- Yeah!
- Ariel:<i> Definitely wanna stay,</i>

38:09.246 --> 38:12.122
But that mission
was absolutely chaotic.

38:12.124 --> 38:13.498
Here's your leadership badge.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.917
A badge! Yes!

38:15.961 --> 38:18.962
You look like
a little oompa loompa.

- Oh!
- ( laughter )

38:26.555 --> 38:29.514
- That is not mission critical.
- You wanna take it back?

38:29.558 --> 38:33.351
And then next,
mr. Louis, aka lance.

38:33.395 --> 38:38.940
- Yes, sir, lance!
- You are mission critical,
young fella.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.358
Come on, og. Damn.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.736
Boy, you done got you
a tan out there, huh?

39:00.255 --> 39:03.381
- Group huddle.
- Oh, boys!

39:03.425 --> 39:06.176
It was three frail
little white men, dude.

39:06.219 --> 39:09.471
Look, family,
we got a decision to make.

39:09.556 --> 39:15.185
As a collective, we'll come
together and figure out
who was not mission critical.

39:15.228 --> 39:18.730
We got tom, we got adam,
and we have chris.

39:18.774 --> 39:23.943
And then I'm guessing
that'll be the individual

39:23.945 --> 39:26.279
Who will take a long walk
off a short bridge.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.406
- Let's stay huddled together.
- Unbelievable.

39:28.450 --> 39:31.576
Good luck.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.379
Now look, family,
we got a decision to make.

39:42.422 --> 39:47.300
Out of these three,
who was mission critical?

39:47.344 --> 39:51.429

We need to know why
you were mission critical.

40:04.194 --> 40:05.944
I'm getting emotional.

40:05.946 --> 40:09.072
There was 11 of you
on that field.

40:09.116 --> 40:13.493
I was doing a favor
by stepping out of the way.

40:13.495 --> 40:16.955
There was already
too many people involved.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.373
It was chaotic.
It was chaos.

40:18.417 --> 40:21.251
- All right?
- I didn't communicate
with chris.

40:21.294 --> 40:23.920
I don't know what he was doing
during the mission.

40:23.964 --> 40:26.965
He knew that he was
a liability, and he took himself
out of the equation.

40:27.008 --> 40:30.051
Marshawn: Right.
Gotcha, gotcha. Adam?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.178
Well, I think I'm critical

40:32.222 --> 40:34.013
Because I'm one of
the hottest people here.

40:34.057 --> 40:37.142
- Period.
- I think that's important

40:37.185 --> 40:39.394
For any kind of challenge
that we do here.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.855
That's being honest.
I think that's being honest.

40:41.898 --> 40:44.566
- He's right.
- That's true. That's true.

40:44.568 --> 40:45.567
That's true.

40:47.195 --> 40:49.404
Adam was kind of with me

40:49.448 --> 40:51.156
'cause we didn't really
know what to do.

40:51.199 --> 40:56.244
We were kind of trying
to pretend we were helping.

40:56.288 --> 40:58.580
But we really were not helping.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.498
Tom.

41:00.542 --> 41:03.084
You know how when people
are under great duress,

41:03.086 --> 41:05.003
Like a woman sees her child
under a car

41:05.046 --> 41:07.297
And they get
superhuman strength?

41:07.340 --> 41:11.217
For one moment,
I had superhuman strength.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.344
- That is--
- I got-- oh, we're good!

41:13.388 --> 41:15.221
- We're good! We're good!
- We got it!

41:15.223 --> 41:16.890
- Marshawn:
<i> There you go. Good job. </i>
- We got it.

41:16.933 --> 41:20.059
Tom was mission critical.
He was picking up things.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.854
- He was definitely in the game.
- Any negatives?

41:22.898 --> 41:24.022
- Not on tom.
- All right.

41:24.107 --> 41:26.107
- Mission critical.
- Tom.

41:27.944 --> 41:32.113
- You were mission critical.
- Hey, I don't wanna leave
without you guys.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.907
- I know. We love you.
- I love you, too.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.943
- And you are very hot.
- Hottest one here.

41:36.953 --> 41:40.288
( cheering )

41:40.332 --> 41:42.415
- Ah, I missed you guys.
- Yeah, tom!

41:42.459 --> 41:47.003
I was on the chopping block,
but I'm the best of the worst.

41:47.005 --> 41:50.298
So that's something, you know?
That's something.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.218
Marshawn:<i> So we got chris</i>
<i> and we got adam.</i>

41:53.220 --> 41:55.512
- They're making this
really dramatic.
- I know!

41:55.555 --> 41:58.515
- So I call him in?
- Yes, call him in.

41:58.558 --> 42:01.309
- It's a unanimous decision.
- Yeah.

42:02.604 --> 42:07.315
- The family has spoken.
- Do we hold hands, man?

42:11.279 --> 42:13.530
Marshawn:
<i>Adam, you are mission critical.</i>
<i> Come on through.</i>

42:13.532 --> 42:18.076
( cheering )

42:18.119 --> 42:20.161
Moving forward,
we just have to assume

42:20.205 --> 42:23.081
Things are gonna go awry
and go wrong,

42:23.083 --> 42:27.502
But I'm grateful to be here
for another day.

42:27.504 --> 42:31.130
Computer:
<i> Chris, this means you</i>
<i> are not mission critical</i>

42:31.132 --> 42:33.091
<i> And must leave the hab</i>
<i> immediately.</i>

42:33.093 --> 42:35.218
( voice breaking )
find me on instagram.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.512
- All right?
- All: Yes!

42:37.556 --> 42:40.515
All: We love you, chris!

42:40.559 --> 42:43.142
Chris:
That was a short trip to mars.

42:51.444 --> 42:53.278
Whoo!

42:53.321 --> 42:54.487
<i> I am not ready for mars.</i>

42:54.531 --> 42:56.281
I personally don't think
any of these stars

42:56.324 --> 43:00.201
Are ready for mars, uh,
except for maybe ronda rousey.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.661
She could take an alien,
for sure.

43:04.082 --> 43:07.083
When you got a commander
and your commander
is commanding you,

43:07.127 --> 43:08.960
If only y'all just
stop talking and listen.

43:08.962 --> 43:10.878
No, if only y'all stop talking.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.380
It's like when
you was telling pete.

43:12.757 --> 43:15.883
You was like, "ay, pete,
if you just go weak,
we'll score a touchdown."

43:15.885 --> 43:18.636
- But this is--
- and he, like, run strong
into the overlap.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.138
I'm the commander.

43:20.181 --> 43:22.223
Richard:<i> The difference</i>
<i> between you and me</i>

43:22.267 --> 43:24.892
<i> Is I'm standing here</i>
<i> in a wind storm.</i>

43:24.936 --> 43:29.105
-<i> Look... </i>
-<i> ( chatter fades )</i>

43:29.107 --> 43:32.400
Shatner:<i> This season</i>
<i> on "stars on mars"...</i>

43:32.444 --> 43:35.111
You guys are ( bleep ) walking!
Run your ass!

43:35.113 --> 43:39.115
- You're gonna die!
- Oh, my god.

43:39.117 --> 43:42.160
- You are killing me.
- Oh, my god, you guys.

43:42.203 --> 43:44.287
Come on!
What are you doing?

43:44.289 --> 43:45.580
What's our battle cry again?

43:45.665 --> 43:47.290
( snoring )

43:47.334 --> 43:49.250
Yeah, I'm a little bit upset.

43:49.294 --> 43:50.710
I've pissed off
way too many people.

43:50.754 --> 43:52.337
No, no, no.
Take this off.

43:52.422 --> 43:53.588
- The water's getting out.
- Take this off.

43:53.590 --> 43:55.923
- Oh!
- Whoa!

43:55.967 --> 43:59.260
If y'all vote me out,
I'm going kicking and screaming.
I swear to god.
