00:29.738 --> 00:32.658
Fear is a universal language.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.785
No matter
where you are in the world,

00:34.952 --> 00:37.162
people fear
what they cannot explain.

00:41.959 --> 00:42.960
How does that feel?

00:45.170 --> 00:46.171
You get some too.

00:47.673 --> 00:48.674
Hey.

00:48.757 --> 00:49.758
Cut it out.

00:49.842 --> 00:50.843
Hey, what happened to her?

00:53.220 --> 00:54.304
Hey. Die already.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.640
Leave her alone, you ass.

00:56.723 --> 00:57.724
What?

00:58.517 --> 00:59.518
Alright, anyway,

01:00.352 --> 01:01.520
It's been over an hour.

01:02.104 --> 01:03.522
I'm not waiting
here all night for help.

01:06.358 --> 01:07.651
Does
anyone have signal yet?

01:08.443 --> 01:09.444
My phone's dead, man.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.488
Unh-unh!
Oh god!

01:13.073 --> 01:14.074
My purse.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.534
I'll catch up.

01:29.173 --> 01:30.174
What?

01:45.606 --> 01:46.607
Shit.

02:09.796 --> 02:10.797
Maya?

02:11.965 --> 02:12.966
What happened?

02:13.175 --> 02:14.551
Guess who's
not coming with us next time.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.719
Come on, bro.

02:15.802 --> 02:16.803
What?

02:18.514 --> 02:19.973
- Give me that.
- Are you kidding me?

02:20.057 --> 02:21.058
God.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.684
Maya?

02:23.185 --> 02:24.186
Maya?

02:28.607 --> 02:30.067
Maya, where are you?

02:38.825 --> 02:39.826
Maya!

02:45.666 --> 02:46.667
Maya!

02:48.836 --> 02:49.837
Maya?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.380
- Maya!
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:51.463 --> 02:52.840
Stop, stop. Stop.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.091
Guys,
it's coming from there.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.801
Maya?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.219
Maya!

02:58.512 --> 02:59.513
Hey, Maya!

03:11.608 --> 03:12.609
Maya?

03:14.736 --> 03:15.737
Maya!

03:15.821 --> 03:18.031
Maya, where are you?
Maya?

03:34.798 --> 03:35.799
What is that?

03:38.594 --> 03:40.179
Maya, don't worry.
We're here.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.435
Maya, don't worry.
We're gonna get you out, yeah?

03:49.396 --> 03:50.856
Who would
lock her in there?

03:56.445 --> 03:57.446
It's not opening.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.076
Maya, just stand back.
I'm gonna break the door open.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.498
It's not opening.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.168
Maya, just relax.
I'm gonna try again.

04:26.808 --> 04:27.809
Guys.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.186
There's something out there.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.108
Wait.
If you're here...

06:03.155 --> 06:04.781
Sorry about my schedule

06:04.865 --> 06:06.491
I'll make it up to you tonight

06:06.575 --> 06:08.202
Pick me up at 6! XOXO

06:14.416 --> 06:15.792
Alright,
take a deep breath for me.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.003
And out.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.840
Is he still
using the nebulizer?

06:22.216 --> 06:23.217
Yes.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.637
Does that hurt?
No.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.306
Well, good news is

06:29.806 --> 06:31.350
we don't have
to cut your nose off.

06:33.810 --> 06:38.440
As a child, I overcame
my fears by embracing science.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.402
Science is about
understanding the unknown.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.738
Not being scared of it.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.699
Everything can be explained.

06:48.992 --> 06:49.993
Hello?

06:52.746 --> 06:53.747
Hello?

06:55.165 --> 06:56.166
Hello?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.385
Surprise!

07:08.887 --> 07:10.097
Happy birthday, babe.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.181
Thanks.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.349
I should have
done this last week.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.934
I know,
I'm the worst girlfriend ever...

07:14.393 --> 07:16.353
As long as you keep
hiding those fun notes for me,

07:16.436 --> 07:17.437
I think we should be okay.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.314
Make a wish.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.406
-Is that?
-Yep.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.783
We're gonna
be there in 48 hours.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.493
I'm so excited.

07:31.577 --> 07:32.703
Are you ready for India?

07:32.786 --> 07:33.996
Oh.

07:34.538 --> 07:38.041
Tum mere...
zindagi ke...pyaaz ho.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.335
What?
What does that mean?

07:41.170 --> 07:44.298
She just called me
the onion of her life.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.841
Dang it.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.342
I meant love.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.678
That's pyaar, not pyaaz.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.054
But I, I get what you mean.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.347
Let's enjoy the cake, okay?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.582
Namaste Mr. and Mrs. Nayar.

09:41.665 --> 09:42.666
Namaste.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.459
Welcome to Roar Resort.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.379
Oh. We're not married.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.298
Oh.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.383
Thank you.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.677
That was
the last wedding of the season.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.721
Now we can
enjoy the peace and quiet too.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.222
This is Navin.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.536
Kind of nice having
the whole place to ourselves.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.213
Like tigers?

10:34.176 --> 10:35.511
Well, I work at a record label.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.180
I help discover singers.

10:44.728 --> 10:45.729
I'm a physician.

10:48.774 --> 10:49.816
Dhanyavaad.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.822
She's better
than she thinks she is.

10:57.658 --> 10:58.700
So, where do you live, Navin?

11:04.623 --> 11:05.999
Can we go there
while we're here?

11:09.044 --> 11:10.045
Can't hear you.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.505
Oh.

11:27.771 --> 11:28.772
So peaceful.

11:29.982 --> 11:30.983
Yeah.

11:40.909 --> 11:41.952
Navin, what about Wi-Fi?

11:49.334 --> 11:50.335
Wi-Fi?

11:50.836 --> 11:51.837
Really?

11:52.004 --> 11:53.589
- I don't need Wi-Fi.
- No.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.592
I really don't need Wi-Fi.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.392
Sorry Navin.

12:05.726 --> 12:06.852
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

12:06.935 --> 12:07.936
Thank you.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.073
I think if I stay right here--

12:21.241 --> 12:22.242
I've got a bar.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.209
Let me help you with that.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.378
Trust me.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.797
All your followers
can wait a week.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.382
-Is that right?
-Yep.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.467
All 12 of them.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.052
For that...

12:40.677 --> 12:42.262
-...you're blocked.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.556
You sure you wanna block me?

12:50.938 --> 12:51.939
You murderer!

13:02.115 --> 13:03.116
Navin?

13:04.493 --> 13:05.494
Navin?

13:07.996 --> 13:08.997
Navin, is that you?

13:19.424 --> 13:20.425
Jay?

13:25.973 --> 13:26.974
I hate you.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.600
Oh my--

13:31.562 --> 13:32.604
That was not funny.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.001
I like to read books.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.758
There's so much talent
and heart in this country.

15:27.553 --> 15:28.887
I'm really
gonna miss this place.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.307
I gotta be honest.

15:32.808 --> 15:34.059
After this last week,

15:34.142 --> 15:35.727
I'm not looking
forward to going back.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.189
Well, lucky for you,

15:39.940 --> 15:41.733
I'm saving the best for last.

15:42.526 --> 15:44.027
I have one more
place I wanna show you.

15:44.403 --> 15:46.738
Please, not 6AM yoga again.

15:46.864 --> 15:47.906
Come on!

15:48.407 --> 15:50.450
How can you
come to India and not do yoga?

15:51.660 --> 15:55.539
Because there's like five yoga
studios on our street in LA.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.584
-55 yoga studios.
-Exactly!

16:03.255 --> 16:04.673
I was thinking that

16:05.549 --> 16:06.884
maybe for the holidays,

16:07.593 --> 16:08.844
we can go meet my folks.

16:10.929 --> 16:11.930
They ask about you.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.309
I have a strong
feeling they wanna meet you.

16:20.314 --> 16:21.315
Yeah.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.233
We really should.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.879
It's a surprise. Come on!

16:44.087 --> 16:45.088
Okay!

16:45.172 --> 16:46.215
- Watch your step.
- But if I fall,

16:46.298 --> 16:48.425
the only surprise you're getting
is a kick in the shin, okay?

16:48.550 --> 16:50.802
Yes, yes, yes. Tough guy.

16:50.928 --> 16:52.137
- Watch it!

16:52.679 --> 16:54.348
- A few more steps.
- Okay.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.974
To your left...

17:00.646 --> 17:01.647
- Okay
- Okay

17:02.147 --> 17:03.190
One big step up...

17:03.607 --> 17:05.108
No. The other way, yeah.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.077
Wow.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.248
Where are we, babe?

17:23.836 --> 17:25.838
Jay, what are you doing?

17:26.630 --> 17:28.090
There are so many reasons why

17:28.173 --> 17:29.883
I'm madly
and deeply in love with you.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.386
And I know we've
only been together for a year,

17:35.264 --> 17:36.807
but you have become
my heart and my soul.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.353
And I don't want this to end.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.610
Amy Edwards,

17:51.321 --> 17:52.322
will you marry me?

18:08.505 --> 18:09.506
Talk to me.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.219
Baby, you know
I love you, right?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.389
I'm just not ready for this.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.436
- My career...
- Career...

18:23.645 --> 18:26.690
You know I'm trying, but
I'm just not where I wanna be.

18:26.899 --> 18:29.818
And I am exactly
where I wanna be.

18:30.986 --> 18:31.987
And that's here.

18:33.822 --> 18:34.823
With you.

18:40.412 --> 18:41.413
You don't get it.

18:47.252 --> 18:48.253
You just don't get it.

18:52.549 --> 18:53.926
Jay, I'm sorry.

19:19.535 --> 19:20.619
This is not the right trail.

19:28.377 --> 19:30.170
We're losing light, babe.

19:30.879 --> 19:31.880
Can I help?

19:34.007 --> 19:35.008
I'm fine.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.970
Need to retrace our steps.

19:51.733 --> 19:52.734
Do you hear that?

19:52.901 --> 19:53.902
What?

19:56.446 --> 19:57.447
The drums.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.061
We shouldn't be here.

20:32.107 --> 20:35.527
He's telling the evil
spirit to leave her body.

20:39.907 --> 20:40.949
I think she's possessed.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.576
We have to do something.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.244
We can't.

22:21.967 --> 22:22.968
- Let's go.
- Amy.

22:23.177 --> 22:24.178
Please.

22:24.678 --> 22:26.138
You have to listen to me.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.182
How can we not do anything?

22:28.724 --> 22:31.101
-Are you okay with this?
-Of course I'm not okay with it.

22:31.185 --> 22:32.853
But we can't
interfere with local rituals

22:32.936 --> 22:33.979
that we don't understand.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.689
What is there to understand?

22:36.857 --> 22:38.817
They're putting
her life in danger.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.445
We don't know what
they believe is going on.

22:41.570 --> 22:42.571
-Amy!

24:23.922 --> 24:24.923
She's unconscious.

24:25.257 --> 24:27.009
She's burning up.
She needs meds, quickly.

24:27.217 --> 24:28.218
Amy...

24:31.388 --> 24:32.848
We're not leaving her here.

24:46.111 --> 24:47.654
Can you make it?

24:47.779 --> 24:48.822
Let's keep moving.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.992
Maybe Navin can help
get us some medical supplies.

24:52.117 --> 24:53.118
No way!

24:53.452 --> 24:54.453
You can't tell anyone!

24:55.245 --> 24:56.246
What if
they take her back?

24:57.497 --> 24:58.665
What if they
do something to us?

25:01.084 --> 25:03.295
Okay,
let's go back to the room.

25:03.837 --> 25:04.838
We'll figure it out.

25:05.047 --> 25:06.590
But we have to tell someone.

25:40.207 --> 25:41.208
Her fever's not breaking.

25:41.667 --> 25:42.668
She needs fluids.

25:42.918 --> 25:43.919
What do we have?

25:50.259 --> 25:51.260
Amy!

25:59.142 --> 26:00.143
I'm Amy.

26:03.313 --> 26:05.274
Mera naam Amy hai.

26:08.735 --> 26:09.736
How are you feeling?

26:14.366 --> 26:16.743
Mera naam Jay hai.

26:18.203 --> 26:19.746
Turmara naam kya hai?

26:20.831 --> 26:21.832
Tum theek ho?

26:23.959 --> 26:25.669
She's still
in shock from the trauma.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.346
What are you giving her?

26:36.430 --> 26:38.140
Aspirin. For the fever.

26:49.484 --> 26:50.485
Can I get a towel?

26:57.242 --> 27:00.078
You poor thing.
What did they do to you?

27:06.293 --> 27:07.294
Anything?

27:24.811 --> 27:25.812
You know what?

27:26.480 --> 27:27.981
I'm glad
we got her out of there.

27:32.736 --> 27:33.779
What next?

27:35.781 --> 27:36.782
Well, at this point,

27:36.865 --> 27:39.243
we don't even know what type
of trauma she's been through.

27:41.578 --> 27:43.830
Once she starts talking,
it'll be easier for us to...

27:54.925 --> 27:57.261
Woh aa rahi hai!

27:57.344 --> 27:58.345
Woh aa rahi hai!

27:58.428 --> 27:59.680
- Kya hua?
- What's going on?

27:59.763 --> 28:00.764
She's saying
somebody is coming.

28:00.848 --> 28:02.349
- Woh kaun aa rahi hai?

28:02.432 --> 28:04.351
- Jay!
- Kiski baath kar rahi ho?

28:04.434 --> 28:06.061
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

28:09.356 --> 28:10.983
Navin! Everything is fine!

28:11.233 --> 28:12.234
Thank you! Good night!

30:11.186 --> 30:12.187
You should rest.

30:13.647 --> 30:14.940
You've been through a lot.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.332
What's your name?

30:38.130 --> 30:40.299
If you come to bed,
I'll tell you a story.

30:41.967 --> 30:43.010
No.

30:44.011 --> 30:46.471
I will tell you a story.

30:49.975 --> 30:50.976
Okay.

30:52.728 --> 30:55.772
You should not
look behind the trees.

30:58.734 --> 31:00.110
Why is that?

31:01.653 --> 31:05.908
Everyday,
mamma sends me to the market

31:07.326 --> 31:08.785
to sell fruit.

31:10.412 --> 31:12.539
Mama always tells me

31:14.291 --> 31:15.792
"Never look back."

31:18.045 --> 31:20.047
Because
that's where they hide,

31:21.924 --> 31:26.512
and they don't
want you to see them.

32:31.910 --> 32:32.911
One day,

32:34.162 --> 32:35.789
while walking

32:37.916 --> 32:39.710
I dropped my doll.

33:29.343 --> 33:30.344
Who is that woman?

33:34.973 --> 33:36.183
I'm sleepy now.

33:37.851 --> 33:38.852
You want to sleep?

33:39.436 --> 33:41.021
Yes. Yes, of course.

35:06.732 --> 35:07.733
Hey you.

35:08.859 --> 35:09.860
Get any sleep?

35:10.944 --> 35:11.945
No.

35:16.074 --> 35:17.701
Been thinking about
what happened last night.

35:20.204 --> 35:21.205
She spoke to me.

35:22.164 --> 35:23.165
I was talking about us.

35:24.666 --> 35:26.293
There I was,
planning the secret proposal

35:26.376 --> 35:27.377
a thousand miles away.

35:30.339 --> 35:31.340
If you said yes...

35:32.591 --> 35:33.800
Then, we don't get lost.

35:35.219 --> 35:36.512
Then, we don't find the girl.

35:40.974 --> 35:41.975
If it wasn't for you,

35:43.936 --> 35:44.937
she could've died.

35:51.860 --> 35:52.903
Last night...

35:56.406 --> 35:57.407
I was broken.

36:01.787 --> 36:02.871
Then you chose to save her.

36:07.334 --> 36:08.502
That reminded me...

36:13.715 --> 36:14.716
...why I love you so much.

36:48.250 --> 36:49.293
Are you okay?

36:49.626 --> 36:50.669
I'm fine. I'm fine, thanks.

37:42.137 --> 37:43.805
Tumne
abhi tak apna naam nahi bataaya.

37:44.473 --> 37:45.474
Asha.

37:46.183 --> 37:47.184
Asha.

37:47.976 --> 37:48.977
That's a pretty name.

37:50.521 --> 37:51.522
Look.

37:51.855 --> 37:52.856
All clean.

37:56.151 --> 37:57.611
I think she's gonna
keep your sweatshirt.

38:02.115 --> 38:03.575
Do you want anything else?

38:17.714 --> 38:19.883
I want to go to mamma and papa.

38:26.056 --> 38:28.100
Do you remember
anything from last night?

38:29.017 --> 38:30.018
Were they there?

38:32.354 --> 38:34.189
My mama-papa are at home.

38:35.774 --> 38:37.109
Please take me there.

38:43.073 --> 38:44.074
She's scared.

38:44.533 --> 38:45.742
She's confused.

38:46.159 --> 38:47.160
She's a child, Jay.

38:48.328 --> 38:49.788
Did we see
the same thing last night?

38:51.164 --> 38:52.165
That was an exorcism.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.751
I know, but that doesn't
mean this girl's possessed.

38:56.253 --> 38:58.005
They probably just don't know

38:58.088 --> 38:59.548
how to explain her behavior.

39:00.132 --> 39:02.509
She could be bi-polar.
Schizophrenic.

39:02.885 --> 39:05.137
I mean, these things
are not easy to diagnose.

39:05.888 --> 39:07.181
And you're not a psychiatrist.

39:08.348 --> 39:10.475
But I've seen
enough patients recover

39:10.559 --> 39:12.102
from mental health issues,

39:12.519 --> 39:15.105
and an exorcism is never
part of their treatment.

39:21.153 --> 39:22.863
So how do you explain
what happened last night?

39:23.572 --> 39:25.532
Maybe she was drugged
to put on a show.

39:29.036 --> 39:30.787
Look, Jay.

39:30.913 --> 39:32.331
I don't have an answer for you.

39:32.664 --> 39:35.209
All I know is that these people
left her out there to die,

39:35.292 --> 39:36.835
and that is not okay.

39:39.796 --> 39:42.341
-I wanna help her too, okay.
-I know you do.

39:43.926 --> 39:46.678
I just need some time
to connect with her.

39:47.554 --> 39:49.681
So that I can
understand what's going on.

39:50.557 --> 39:51.558
We leave tomorrow.

39:53.310 --> 39:55.062
Are you saying
you want to extend our trip?

39:57.648 --> 39:59.525
She wants her parents.

40:00.859 --> 40:02.319
We have to find them.

40:59.793 --> 41:01.253
Asha, sweetie.

41:01.628 --> 41:03.046
Why don't I help
you down from there.

41:06.508 --> 41:08.468
So, Navin agreed
to show me his village.

41:09.428 --> 41:11.263
I told him I wanted
to take some pictures.

41:12.097 --> 41:13.098
Let's find out what's going on.

41:13.432 --> 41:14.433
Good.

41:14.516 --> 41:17.311
But after that we take
Asha back to her parents, right?

41:34.286 --> 41:35.287
Jay.

41:39.041 --> 41:40.584
I just want you to know...

41:42.794 --> 41:44.338
I didn't forget about us.

41:47.799 --> 41:49.593
-Wait, what happened here?
-It's okay--

41:49.676 --> 41:52.346
You're not
supposed to whistle at night.

41:54.139 --> 41:55.516
Do you know why?

41:57.100 --> 41:58.477
I can tell you.

42:00.354 --> 42:01.396
Jay, um...

42:01.980 --> 42:04.358
...looks like
Asha wants to tell us a story.

42:06.151 --> 42:08.403
She shared one with me earlier.

42:11.198 --> 42:12.699
My pappa told me

42:14.076 --> 42:15.786
never to whistle at night

42:17.329 --> 42:19.998
or very bad things

42:21.124 --> 42:22.167
would happen.

42:26.797 --> 42:27.965
One night...

44:58.198 --> 44:59.199
Do you think
that really happened?

45:02.411 --> 45:04.830
It's not uncommon
for children to use stories

45:04.913 --> 45:06.039
to express themselves.

45:08.333 --> 45:10.711
She told me one
last night about the same woman.

45:11.628 --> 45:12.629
Look.

45:13.422 --> 45:15.090
Look, I got Navin
waiting downstairs.

45:15.757 --> 45:18.510
But I'm not comfortable
leaving you with her alone.

45:20.220 --> 45:21.805
You saw what she's capable of.

45:23.473 --> 45:24.558
I'll be fine.

45:52.294 --> 45:53.295
What's the mask for?

46:02.429 --> 46:04.097
You really have
to watch your back here, huh?

46:16.902 --> 46:17.903
It's an expression.

46:18.946 --> 46:19.947
"Watch your back",

46:20.072 --> 46:21.865
meaning, "be careful.

46:23.283 --> 46:24.284
Never mind.

46:26.286 --> 46:28.664
Thank you for taking the time
to show me your village, Navin.

46:32.251 --> 46:33.252
Navin.

46:33.794 --> 46:35.629
Thank you for taking the time
to show me your village.

46:39.842 --> 46:41.468
My grandparents
came from a small village

46:41.552 --> 46:42.553
outside of Bangalore.

46:43.011 --> 46:44.137
I remember as a child,

46:44.888 --> 46:46.098
it was about
the simple pleasures.

46:56.024 --> 46:57.234
It's a heat rash.

47:02.281 --> 47:03.949
I'm fine, Navin. Thanks.

47:05.826 --> 47:06.827
How much further?

47:18.380 --> 47:20.966
I have something
else you might like.

48:07.304 --> 48:09.556
Asha, why do you
tell me those stories?

48:10.557 --> 48:11.975
I tell them to everyone.

48:12.392 --> 48:13.393
Do you like them?

48:14.269 --> 48:15.354
Of course I do.

48:18.982 --> 48:21.109
Who's the woman?
Is she real?

48:21.193 --> 48:22.194
Yes!

48:22.402 --> 48:23.779
Real like you.

48:28.325 --> 48:29.326
Does she talk to you?

48:29.952 --> 48:30.953
Yes.

48:34.831 --> 48:35.916
Will she talk to me?

48:50.931 --> 48:51.932
Navin?

48:52.891 --> 48:53.892
What's that?

49:01.900 --> 49:02.901
I'm sorry.

49:03.443 --> 49:04.444
What happened?

49:09.992 --> 49:10.993
On the same day?

50:27.236 --> 50:28.237
Sorry.

50:29.154 --> 50:30.572
If I knew about this,
I wouldn't have asked you

50:30.656 --> 50:31.657
to bring me here today.

51:05.357 --> 51:06.358
Navin.

51:10.696 --> 51:11.697
I need your help.

51:49.151 --> 51:50.152
Over there.

52:13.008 --> 52:14.009
Try now.

52:57.094 --> 52:58.095
Come play!

53:02.558 --> 53:04.226
Sweetie, we can't
stay out here too long.

53:04.309 --> 53:05.602
One minute, please!

54:12.669 --> 54:13.670
Navin.

54:14.171 --> 54:15.214
Navin.

54:17.841 --> 54:19.051
There's
something in there.

54:38.779 --> 54:40.030
Let me show you.

55:20.904 --> 55:21.905
You know this place?

55:32.624 --> 55:34.209
That's what
I wanted to tell you.

55:34.918 --> 55:37.212
We got lost
and ended up here.

55:37.504 --> 55:38.797
We saw these people,

55:39.089 --> 55:40.966
lock this child inside there.

55:44.887 --> 55:45.888
Navin.

55:47.514 --> 55:48.599
We had to do something.

55:52.561 --> 55:53.562
We took her out.

57:07.261 --> 57:09.388
Amy is taking
good care of her.

57:09.763 --> 57:12.140
You have
to help me find her parents.

58:10.073 --> 58:12.034
Just because
a child is disobedient--

58:12.492 --> 58:14.912
Navin,
you don't lock her up inside.

59:32.906 --> 59:33.907
I hear you, Navin.

59:36.326 --> 59:38.036
She's not going back in there.

1:00:04.605 --> 1:00:05.606
Navin!

1:00:32.007 --> 1:00:33.008
Asha?

1:02:35.255 --> 1:02:36.256
Asha?

1:03:12.626 --> 1:03:13.627
Asha.

1:03:57.880 --> 1:03:59.214
Who were you talking to?

1:04:02.509 --> 1:04:03.510
Asha.

1:04:03.844 --> 1:04:06.680
-You have to tell me--
-She wants me to hurt you!

1:04:07.931 --> 1:04:08.932
If I don't,

1:04:09.808 --> 1:04:11.518
she'll make me do it.

1:04:15.272 --> 1:04:16.315
Who?

1:04:16.899 --> 1:04:17.941
My mother.

1:04:19.026 --> 1:04:20.652
Why does she want to hurt me?

1:04:22.279 --> 1:04:25.115
Because she knows I like you.

1:04:28.744 --> 1:04:30.078
How did she get here?

1:04:32.039 --> 1:04:33.207
You called her.

1:04:39.463 --> 1:04:41.298
Is your mother here now?

1:04:47.054 --> 1:04:48.347
Why can't I see her?

1:04:49.223 --> 1:04:50.599
She's hiding.

1:04:52.809 --> 1:04:53.810
In this room?

1:04:58.649 --> 1:05:00.317
Will you tell me
where she's hiding?

1:05:06.323 --> 1:05:07.324
Okay.

1:05:12.162 --> 1:05:13.205
No one in there.

1:05:21.213 --> 1:05:22.422
No one in there either.

1:05:23.924 --> 1:05:26.552
Mere andhar. Mere Andhar.

1:05:33.767 --> 1:05:34.768
Inside you?

1:05:53.537 --> 1:05:56.081
I do believe
there's something inside of you.

1:05:56.957 --> 1:05:59.960
And now, you have to
believe that I can take it out.

1:06:30.782 --> 1:06:32.451
There's nothing
to be scared of.

1:06:33.118 --> 1:06:34.870
You have
to believe that, okay?

1:06:47.382 --> 1:06:49.676
May the spirit
leave you forever.

1:06:52.888 --> 1:06:55.140
May the spirit
leave you forever.

1:06:59.269 --> 1:07:01.730
May the spirit
leave you forever.

1:07:14.535 --> 1:07:16.870
What
the hell am I doing?

1:07:22.417 --> 1:07:24.294
Woh mere andhar aa gayi hai.

1:07:24.545 --> 1:07:27.881
Uski bhayankar krodh
se koyi nahi bach saktha.

1:07:37.891 --> 1:07:40.477
I command
the spirit to leave this girl!

1:07:52.281 --> 1:07:54.950
I command
this spirit to leave this girl.

1:08:18.473 --> 1:08:19.474
Asha?

1:08:21.351 --> 1:08:22.352
Asha?

1:08:48.295 --> 1:08:49.713
You're free now.

1:08:51.340 --> 1:08:52.925
There's nothing to be scared of.

1:09:17.074 --> 1:09:20.202
Asha, I'm very
proud of you for letting go

1:09:20.285 --> 1:09:21.995
whatever was upsetting you.

1:09:36.218 --> 1:09:38.011
Amy?
You gotta get out of there.

1:09:38.220 --> 1:09:40.931
Asha's been lying to us.
She killed her family.

1:09:41.014 --> 1:09:42.558
I'm coming to get you.

1:09:42.641 --> 1:09:43.892
Just get out of there!

1:10:29.813 --> 1:10:31.773
Jay. Where are you?

1:10:31.857 --> 1:10:33.066
You've
reached my voicemail.

1:10:33.192 --> 1:10:34.318
Leave me
a message!

1:10:34.401 --> 1:10:36.445
Jay. I need you!
I need you right---

1:10:54.546 --> 1:10:56.340
Asha?

1:11:36.463 --> 1:11:37.464
Asha?

1:11:45.264 --> 1:11:46.849
What is this?

1:12:30.350 --> 1:12:31.852
What have I done?

1:12:34.730 --> 1:12:35.731
Where's Jay?

1:12:41.904 --> 1:12:43.280
I can't be involved.

1:13:26.031 --> 1:13:27.032
What happened?

1:14:11.326 --> 1:14:12.327
Navin?

1:14:12.995 --> 1:14:14.037
What are you doing?

1:14:26.008 --> 1:14:27.426
We wanted to help her.

1:14:28.886 --> 1:14:30.262
I'm so sorry.

1:14:31.763 --> 1:14:33.724
I just want all this to end.

1:14:42.107 --> 1:14:44.401
Please, Navin.

1:14:46.278 --> 1:14:47.779
Where is he?

1:15:21.396 --> 1:15:22.397
Stop!

1:15:45.629 --> 1:15:48.131
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:07.359
Come on,
come on, come on!

1:16:08.610 --> 1:16:10.404
You gotta be kidding me.

1:16:29.298 --> 1:16:31.300
Where are
the goddamn keys?

1:16:32.759 --> 1:16:33.760
Come on!

1:16:34.011 --> 1:16:35.345
Where are you?

1:16:52.779 --> 1:16:53.947
Come on...

1:17:44.748 --> 1:17:45.999
Asha, please!

1:17:47.125 --> 1:17:48.126
Help!

1:17:49.294 --> 1:17:50.295
Somebody help!

1:18:51.315 --> 1:18:52.316
Stop!

1:18:52.399 --> 1:18:53.400
Please!

1:18:53.609 --> 1:18:54.610
Stop!

1:19:15.506 --> 1:19:16.715
You're safe now.

1:19:18.550 --> 1:19:20.302
I won't let her hurt you.

1:19:38.904 --> 1:19:41.031
No! Somebody help!

1:19:41.198 --> 1:19:42.533
Please!

1:19:46.078 --> 1:19:47.079
No!

1:19:49.164 --> 1:19:51.041
Help, please!

1:19:56.255 --> 1:19:58.048
Please! Help!

1:21:27.554 --> 1:21:28.555
Amy?

1:21:30.641 --> 1:21:31.642
Amy?

1:21:38.815 --> 1:21:39.816
Amy?

1:21:40.817 --> 1:21:42.736
I'm hurt. I need your help.

1:22:17.062 --> 1:22:18.063
Amy!

1:22:18.939 --> 1:22:20.607
I kept having
the same nightmare.

1:22:21.149 --> 1:22:22.150
Over and over again.

1:22:23.151 --> 1:22:24.987
Amy was
missing for four days now.

1:22:25.487 --> 1:22:28.699
And the local police
were still searching for Navin.

1:22:30.951 --> 1:22:32.244
Nothing makes sense.

1:23:06.195 --> 1:23:07.196
Stop!

1:23:11.533 --> 1:23:14.077
Please, help us!
Please, open the door!

1:23:16.788 --> 1:23:18.165
Who would lock her in there?

1:23:18.373 --> 1:23:21.084
Wait, if you're here...
