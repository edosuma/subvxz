WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:02.419
Previously on 90210:

00:02.544 --> 00:03.586
We need to talk.

00:03.711 --> 00:05.714
We have a son together.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.508
I'm Ozzie.
Now that I know who you are,

00:07.633 --> 00:10.260
it's gonna sting so much more
when I never talk to you again.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.972
I am tired of pretending
that everything is okay

00:13.096 --> 00:14.515
when it's not--
we need to tell the kids

00:14.640 --> 00:16.056
about your birth son
sooner than later.
No, no, no.

00:16.183 --> 00:16.642
I caught her buying drugs.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.310
I'm a cop, you dumbass.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.312
How old are you, anyway?
KIMBERLY:
I'm 25, why?

00:20.437 --> 00:22.690
I would literally do
anything for you.
Oh, my God.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.942
You paid for
my rehab?
Yeah, I did.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.902
I don't think we can be
friends if you're with Ethan.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.071
NAOMI:
I know that I can't stop him
from dating other people.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.490
It just can't be you.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.294
So.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.338
So...?

00:46.463 --> 00:47.464
So, I have something

00:47.589 --> 00:50.801
that I would like to
discuss as a family.

00:58.017 --> 01:00.101
When I was in high school,
I dated Tracy Clark.

01:00.227 --> 01:00.769
Ew.

01:00.895 --> 01:01.812
Uh-- I'm sorry.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.230
That was just
disturbing.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.982
(kids laughing)
It was a
long time ago.

01:05.105 --> 01:09.820
When I was in high school,
I dated Tracy Clark,

01:09.945 --> 01:11.572
and at the end
of senior year,

01:11.697 --> 01:13.156
she... got pregnant.

01:13.281 --> 01:15.242
Very surprising,
and obviously

01:15.367 --> 01:17.661
a big deal, but, um...

01:17.786 --> 01:19.955
Well, Tracy and I, we weren't...

01:20.080 --> 01:21.957
right for each other
as a couple

01:22.082 --> 01:23.375
and weren't ready for
the responsibility

01:23.500 --> 01:26.211
that a child
would entail, so,

01:26.336 --> 01:29.297
we decided not
to keep the child.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.801
The baby.

01:32.927 --> 01:33.886
Tracy was gonna not have it.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.554
So, basically, I
went away to college

01:35.679 --> 01:37.806
and that was that.

01:37.932 --> 01:40.099
Only that wasn't that.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.771
Apparently
Tracy... didn't

01:43.896 --> 01:45.814
not have it.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.399
She had it.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.401
Him.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.652
A baby boy.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.529
She put him up
for adoption.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.200
You have a son?
No.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.244
Another son. A second son.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.871
I already have a son.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.415
Wow.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.835
Exactly how long have you
known about this second son?

02:07.878 --> 02:09.670
Not long. At all.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.799
We found out about
two months ago.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.050
You've known about this
for two months?

02:13.174 --> 02:17.262
All I can say is
that I love you guys.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.806
I love this family,

02:18.931 --> 02:20.515
and this news
doesn't change

02:20.641 --> 02:22.434
any of that.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.895
I have no interest
in digging up the past.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.730
So why are you telling us now?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.398
DEBBIE:
Because Tracy Clark

02:28.523 --> 02:30.484
is interested
in digging up the past.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.527
She's already hired
a private investigator,

02:32.653 --> 02:35.572
and she is planning
on telling Naomi.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.700
So you wanted to, you know,
fill us in on your little secret

02:38.826 --> 02:39.660
before the whole world knew.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.202
No secret.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.538
You are my daughter.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.414
You are my son.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.916
This is my family.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.876
This is what is important to me.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.921
I'm just really
hoping that

02:51.046 --> 02:52.464
this doesn't affect
us in any way.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.466
Okay?

02:58.053 --> 02:58.929
DEBBIE:
So?

02:59.054 --> 03:00.889
So...

03:01.015 --> 03:02.474
Dixon, what are you thinking?

03:03.934 --> 03:05.727
Uh...

03:05.853 --> 03:08.355
Well, ac-actually, I'm thinking
I gotta go to school.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.482
Annie?

03:10.607 --> 03:11.650
Yeah. School.

03:11.775 --> 03:12.943
Better go.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.489
(sighs)

03:17.614 --> 03:19.366
So?
So.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.659
How do you think that went?

03:20.784 --> 03:22.953
Um... It... could've been worse.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.627
(sighs)

03:30.752 --> 03:33.588
Ugh!
What?!

03:33.714 --> 03:36.967
"I-I'm really hoping that this
doesn't affect us in any way."

03:37.092 --> 03:39.136
It's like,
what did he do?

03:39.260 --> 03:40.303
Did he practice last night
in front of a mirror?

03:40.428 --> 03:41.638
Like, really?

03:41.763 --> 03:43.140
Maybe he was,
you know, nervous

03:43.264 --> 03:45.350
about it or
something,
you know?
Yeah.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.145
Well, he had about two
months to prepare for it.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.938
Come on. Cut the guy
a little bit of slack.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.691
Face it-- Dad's a hypocrite.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.860
He tells us not to have sex,
but when he was

03:54.985 --> 03:56.319
in high school
he got Tracy pregnant.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.320
Okay, plus,
did you see

03:57.445 --> 03:58.697
the way he kept,
like, glancing at Mom

03:58.822 --> 03:59.698
the entire time and what

03:59.823 --> 04:00.824
was she doing,
holding his cue cards?

04:00.949 --> 04:02.159
All right, um...

04:02.283 --> 04:04.494
for the record here,
I just need to know.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.039
Are you mad at him because
he rehearsed what he was

04:07.164 --> 04:08.790
gonna say?
Because he has a son?

04:08.916 --> 04:12.669
Because he's a hypocrite?
Or, D, all of the above?

04:14.088 --> 04:16.214
Doesn't this bug you? At all?

04:16.339 --> 04:21.553
♪ Give me something
to believe... ♪

04:21.678 --> 04:22.888
It's freaky.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.973
All right? But I'm cool.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.980
So, half your brother,
and half Naomi's?

04:32.106 --> 04:35.150
Yeah, but it's not like
he's half her and half me.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.153
You're making it sound like some
weird mythological creature,

04:38.278 --> 04:39.947
like a minotaur or
mermaid or something.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.115
Well, it's weird, though.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.158
Yeah, it's a hundred
percent weird,

04:43.283 --> 04:46.578
and it certainly complicates
things between Naomi and me--

04:46.703 --> 04:49.289
Which weren't not
complicated before.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.584
I mean, she asked me
to not date you at Homecoming.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.586
Well, it's none of her
business who you date.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.171
Yeah, I know, but...

04:56.296 --> 04:59.091
Well, we're kind of at a fork
in the road here. I mean...

04:59.216 --> 05:01.093
Should you and me
be you and me?

05:01.218 --> 05:03.386
Or should we be you and me?

05:04.638 --> 05:05.555
You know what I think?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.348
What?

05:07.474 --> 05:08.976
Maybe we should try to
keep our relationship

05:09.101 --> 05:10.769
on the D.L. for a few weeks.

05:10.894 --> 05:14.689
You want to hide that
we're seeing each other?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.900
Look, I want us
to be you and me,

05:17.025 --> 05:19.694
but I think if we act like
we're just you and me

05:19.820 --> 05:21.238
for a little while,
it'll make things

05:21.362 --> 05:22.530
easier with Naomi,
and that'll give her

05:22.656 --> 05:24.365
time to hook up
with some other guy

05:24.491 --> 05:25.575
and she'll forget
all about us.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.077
Okay.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.912
Um... Yeah.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.914
Yeah, that's another
path... in the road.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.540
Think about it this way.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.918
We'll get to make out
in secret places.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.503
(laughing):
Ethan.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.546
Oh, it's killing me.
I'm so close to you, yet

05:38.672 --> 05:40.090
I-- sss!-- can't
touch you.
Shut up.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.591
Hey, you want to hang
out after school?

05:41.716 --> 05:43.384
We can be you and
me after school.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.970
I really want to be
you and me, Annie.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.638
Me, too, Ethan.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.806
All right,
fine. Go away.

05:47.931 --> 05:48.974
I'll see you later.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.475
Hey, there.
Hi.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.227
(clearing throat)

05:52.351 --> 05:55.063
Don't tell me you're trying
to be the rebound girl.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.815
With Ethan? Me?

05:56.940 --> 05:58.399
No. No rebounds.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.110
Not me. I'm going
to let that ball

06:00.235 --> 06:01.402
bounce right off the hoop.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.445
Smart.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.446
Smart girl.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.073
Um...

06:05.199 --> 06:06.992
So Dixon told me
about the new brother.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.076
That's intense.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.828
Understatement.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.163
Well, I figured
maybe you want

06:11.288 --> 06:12.539
to blow off some
steam, get away

06:12.664 --> 06:14.041
from the parental units
for a night?

06:14.166 --> 06:15.917
Mmm. What you have in mind?

06:16.043 --> 06:18.337
Well, Kelly's coming
back this weekend,

06:18.461 --> 06:20.505
and I have to take advantage
of my last nights of freedom

06:20.630 --> 06:22.590
so I'm thinking--
slumber party at my house.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.718
All right, I mean, it sounds
a little PG-13, but...

06:24.843 --> 06:28.096
No! No, it'll be fun, and
I would love to get away

06:28.222 --> 06:30.515
from it all-- and by "it
all," I mean my family.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.059
I'm definitely in.

06:40.859 --> 06:41.902
Hey.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.111
So how are we doing?

06:43.237 --> 06:44.696
Great. Except,

06:44.821 --> 06:46.948
everyone's staring at me
like I forgot to wear pants.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.993
I went to rehab. Now I'm
out, so what's the big deal?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.828
I think they're just
checking out your cute hat.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.038
(both chuckling)

06:53.163 --> 06:55.123
Thanks.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.500
It's uh...
very Pete Doherty.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.587
In a, in a,
in a feminine, non-skanky

07:00.712 --> 07:03.173
uh, British guy
sort of way.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.133
Thanks, Navid.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.095
Jelly beans?

07:08.220 --> 07:09.637
You brought me jelly beans?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.807
Yeah. I was just feeling
that, you know, you might...

07:12.933 --> 07:15.227
deal with today better if, you
know, you had some jelly beans.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.686
Either that or you'll just
get high off the sugar.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.272
I-I can't believe

07:18.397 --> 07:19.064
I just said "high"
be-be-because you,

07:19.189 --> 07:20.565
you wouldn't get high.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.984
It's okay.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.152
I like jelly beans.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.280
What's your favorite flavor?

07:28.031 --> 07:29.199
Popcorn.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.158
The most disgusting
jelly bean

07:30.284 --> 07:31.243
ever known to mankind?

07:31.368 --> 07:33.370
Uh, it's buttery and delicious.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.956
Okay, I was just about
to say "just like you,"

07:36.081 --> 07:37.457
and then I
changed my mind.
Uh-huh,

07:37.582 --> 07:39.042
and then you somehow
managed to say it anyway?

07:39.167 --> 07:40.001
True. Ah...

07:40.127 --> 07:43.504
Mmm. Isn't that yummy?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.465
I gotta go to class.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.844
"Buttery and delicious."

07:49.970 --> 07:51.596
Seriously, Navid,
"buttery and delicious"?

07:51.721 --> 07:52.973
That's all you could think of?

07:53.098 --> 07:54.099
(school bell ringing)

07:56.101 --> 07:58.186
Hey. Can we talk?

07:58.312 --> 07:59.479
Annie?

08:05.068 --> 08:06.361
Naomi!
Oh, can't talk.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.156
Geometry quiz. Gotta figure out
why a square is a rectangle

08:09.281 --> 08:10.490
but not every
rectangle's a square.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.453
So. Your dad
and my mommy,

08:14.577 --> 08:16.997
doing the nasty-- are you
as grossed out as I am?

08:17.122 --> 08:20.208
Yeah. I'm guessing I'm a little
bit more grossed out than you.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.793
So when did
she tell you?

08:21.918 --> 08:23.378
Oh, you know,
at breakfast.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.213
She was all,
"Darling, good morning.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.466
Could you pass the
probiotic yogurt?

08:27.590 --> 08:30.051
Oh, and by the way,
you have a brother."

08:30.177 --> 08:31.136
Parents are clueless.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.886
No kidding.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.722
Hey, you bummed out about it?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.434
It's just... whatever.

08:38.558 --> 08:39.977
Well, you know what helps me
when I'm bumming?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.813
Jimmy Choo.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.148
Chinese food?

08:43.273 --> 08:44.607
Oh, God.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.942
Oh, Kansas.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.195
No. Jimmy Choo shoes.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.613
Oh.
God's gift
to women.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.240
(giggling) What are you
doing after school?

08:52.366 --> 08:57.578
Today? Um... Today
after school, I, me, um...

08:57.704 --> 08:59.080
Today I'm, I'm, um...

08:59.206 --> 09:00.748
Are you okay?
Are you having a stroke?

09:00.874 --> 09:04.752
No, I... I...

09:04.878 --> 09:08.256
have no plans at all.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.258
ETHAN:
No plans?
What happened to "you and me"?

09:10.384 --> 09:12.635
Yeah. I guess I panicked.
I mean, all of a sudden

09:12.760 --> 09:14.513
my mind was just a snowy
snowscape of blank.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.640
and, I don't know...
maybe this D.L. business

09:17.765 --> 09:18.683
just isn't my cup of tea.

09:18.808 --> 09:19.809
No, no, it's cool,
it's cool.

09:19.934 --> 09:20.810
You just got
to be prepared

09:20.935 --> 09:22.270
in case Naomi asks you
to do something.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.897
You're an actress.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.315
Let's rehearse, okay?

09:25.440 --> 09:26.691
Okay, I'm, I'm Naomi.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.651
Why, Naomi, you're looking
rather butch today.

09:28.776 --> 09:29.944
Okay, shh...

09:30.070 --> 09:32.155
Just give me a second while
I get into character here.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.281
(inhaling):
Naomi.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.824
Okay.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.952
Hey, Annie, what do you say
after school

09:38.078 --> 09:39.496
we, uh, hit up
the Polo Lounge

09:39.620 --> 09:42.040
and you can watch me blow off
David Spade for the 80th time?

09:42.165 --> 09:43.083
(laughing):
No, Naomi,

09:43.208 --> 09:44.125
I'm sorry.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.377
I'm busy.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.336
See, there it is,
there it is, okay.

09:46.461 --> 09:47.795
So next time
it's you and me.

09:47.921 --> 09:48.922
Oh.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.006
(chuckles)

10:14.448 --> 10:15.823
I invited Adrianna,
by the way.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.284
I don't know if she's
gonna come, but...

10:17.409 --> 10:18.743
That's very sweet
of you.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.036
Trying to be a
girl's girl.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.204
It's a little
new to me.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.497
Hey, Naomi,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.165
do you want to come
to a slumber party

10:24.291 --> 10:25.292
at my house tonight?

10:25.417 --> 10:26.376
Kelly's still out of town,

10:26.501 --> 10:27.794
and we got to take advantage.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.045
A slumber party?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.464
How retro of you.

10:30.589 --> 10:31.798
What are you gonna do,
braid each other's hair

10:31.923 --> 10:33.216
and put on face masks?

10:33.341 --> 10:34.384
Well, you don't have
to come if you don't want.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.760
Oh, no,
I'll be there,

10:35.885 --> 10:37.387
I'm just gonna bring
my own face mask.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.513
These pores deserve
the very best.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.847
Plus, I really have
to get to know

10:39.973 --> 10:43.518
this family of mine,
don't I? Right, sis?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.019
You can wear your
new Jimmy Choos.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.938
Sure, sis...

10:47.063 --> 10:48.607
Hey, we should totally
play Truth or Dare.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.400
That way, I can get
to know everything

10:50.525 --> 10:52.235
about this new
sister of mine.

10:57.407 --> 11:01.328
Penny for your thoughts.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.830
A penny...
in Beverly Hills?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.832
We're in a recession.
(chuckles)

11:05.957 --> 11:09.252
Come on. What are you
thinking about?

11:09.377 --> 11:11.463
About my dad's laugh.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.298
Is that a poem
or something?

11:13.423 --> 11:14.841
'Cause I like it.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.093
Whenever Annie laughs,
you know, people always say,

11:17.218 --> 11:19.346
"Oh, she sounds just like
her mother."

11:20.888 --> 11:25.393
Well, now I know that somebody
out there...

11:25.519 --> 11:26.853
Who has your
dad's laugh?

11:26.978 --> 11:29.356
I don't need his laugh.
I got my own laugh.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.316
(laughs)

11:31.441 --> 11:33.860
Yeah, and your laugh
probably sounds like
your birth dad's.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.028
Yeah, maybe.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.695
You know,

11:36.821 --> 11:39.115
I've been wanting to ask
you about your adoption,

11:39.240 --> 11:41.784
but I never really knew
when was the right time.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.621
Well, I don't feel bad
talking about it.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.831
I used to live
with my grandmother
in Brooklyn.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.167
Dad wasn't in the picture--
addiction problems.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.585
So when my grandmother died,

11:50.709 --> 11:53.505
I moved to Kansas
to be with my mom.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.422
So you knew your
birth mother?

11:54.548 --> 11:55.465
Mm-hmm.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.425
Wow.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.928
Unfortunately,
she was crazy.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.348
Not so big on taking medication,
so long story short,

12:03.473 --> 12:05.183
Social Services came

12:05.308 --> 12:06.601
and took me away.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.935
Do you ever want
to see her again?

12:08.061 --> 12:09.979
Nah.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.066
I know the feeling.

12:13.191 --> 12:16.986
(scoffs)
Come on now. It's cool.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.364
I'm not about to play
myself a violin.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.367
I mean, look where I live.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.077
Look where I go to school.

12:24.202 --> 12:27.497
My super-hot girlfriend, hmm?

12:27.622 --> 12:29.832
And my family,
I mean, come on.

12:29.957 --> 12:30.958
Yeah.
(chuckles)

12:31.084 --> 12:32.168
Yeah, and I guess

12:32.293 --> 12:34.546
the Wilsons saw how
special you were.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.297
They knew they had
to have you.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.550
(clears throat)

12:38.675 --> 12:44.389
So, uh, when you gonna realize
that you just have to have me?

12:44.514 --> 12:46.933
Ooh, I don't know, soon.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.810
(both laugh)
Shut up.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.608
Punctuality. I like that
in a student.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.568
Thought I could get
a couple seconds alone with you.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.070
Yeah, we can't really
be alone here.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.072
You know,

13:01.197 --> 13:02.907
it's getting harder for me
to see you every day in school.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.618
How do you think I feel?

13:04.743 --> 13:06.578
I'm supposed to be completely
focused on this case,

13:06.703 --> 13:09.956
and here I am thinking
about one of my teachers.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.542
RYAN:
Uh, that is why you can do
the extra credit

13:12.667 --> 13:14.335
to make up the assignment.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.421
That blows, Mr. Matthews.

13:16.546 --> 13:20.007
That's life, Kimberly.
Take a seat.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.384
Hey.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.428
Hey.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.139
So... I'm working on getting you

13:26.264 --> 13:27.474
those "party favors"
you mentioned.

13:27.599 --> 13:30.477
Cool.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.313
I'm, uh, looking forward
to "celebrating."

13:33.438 --> 13:35.273
Oh, we'll celebrate.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.907
ADRIANNA:
I don't love slumber parties.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.409
You still have
to come, Ade.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.994
I don't know.
I got my meeting
after school:

13:48.119 --> 13:51.164
Students Against
Destructive Decisions.

13:51.289 --> 13:54.041
It's one of my
preconditions for
coming back and...

13:54.167 --> 13:55.918
SADD?

13:56.043 --> 13:57.962
SADD is right.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.464
Okay, so you'll
come after. Fantastic.

13:59.589 --> 14:00.923
I don't know,
though.

14:01.048 --> 14:02.008
If you guys are
drinking,

14:02.133 --> 14:03.510
I don't want
to be the downer.

14:03.635 --> 14:04.636
You're being
a downer now.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.095
The party's not
gonna be all booze.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.264
It's about ice cream
and cookie dough
and face masks.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.557
It'll be really cute.

14:09.683 --> 14:10.891
NAVID:
There you go! Hey!

14:11.017 --> 14:12.226
These are for you.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.603
I sorted out
just the popcorns.

14:13.728 --> 14:14.979
You sorted jelly beans
for me?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.606
Yeah, well, I'm a man
of many talents,

14:16.731 --> 14:19.275
the majority
of which are
rather useless.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.901
Uh, I'll see you later?

14:25.448 --> 14:30.453
Okay, this took hours of freaky
jelly bean sorting. Hello?

14:30.578 --> 14:33.289
He's either OCD
or he wants to
sleep with you.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.875
He's just being
dorky Navid.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.336
Oh, yeah, well, dorky Navid
paid for your rehab.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.004
He wants something
from you, clearly.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.047
Whatever.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.423
You're so going
to have to use

14:42.549 --> 14:43.591
your powers over him

14:43.717 --> 14:45.635
to get him to sort
my closet.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.636
Color code.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.638
Naomi, ¿que pasa?

14:48.763 --> 14:50.348
What are you
doing tonight?

14:50.473 --> 14:52.559
Oh, I have a date.
Mama Celeste.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.018
You're eating pizza?

14:54.143 --> 14:54.561
Mm-hmm.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.146
And you can't reschedule?

14:57.271 --> 14:58.773
Oh, no, it would have to be
something really special.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.404
You're making that guy
run in so many circles

15:04.529 --> 15:05.780
he's gonna get dizzy.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.323
Mm-hmm, and I'm not stopping
till he's sorting

15:07.448 --> 15:09.283
the Mikes from the Ikes
and the Goods
from the Plenties.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.785
(laughs)

15:16.332 --> 15:18.042
(knocks)

15:18.167 --> 15:20.253
Hey, got a call from
our credit card company.

15:20.378 --> 15:23.381
They said there was some
unusual activity on the card.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.966
Quite a significant
amount of unusual activity.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.968
You know anything
about that?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.303
Sounds unusual.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.058
I kind of bought some boots.

15:34.183 --> 15:37.520
Annie, that's an emergency card.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.313
I really needed boots?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.232
These?

15:41.357 --> 15:42.817
Items of footwear?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.861
They cost as much
as a small car.

15:44.985 --> 15:48.406
What is this?
Where are you going?

15:48.531 --> 15:50.408
Silver's having
a sleepover at
her sister's house.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.034
I thought Kelly was
still out of town.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.121
No. No, you can't stay there

15:55.246 --> 15:56.706
if there's not going
to be an adult around.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.708
Oh, come on, Dad!

15:58.833 --> 16:00.501
Sorry, no party.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.753
It's a slumber party.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.337
It's a bunch of girls sitting
around watching movies

16:03.463 --> 16:05.506
and eating pizza--
I'm nearly 16 years old!

16:05.632 --> 16:08.175
When you were my age,
you were making babies.

16:11.345 --> 16:15.683
Annie, you are not going
to the party.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.184
Rules are rules.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.103
And, and these boots,
they're going back.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.229
No way!

16:20.354 --> 16:22.565
Yes... way.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.552
(overlapping chatter)

16:51.678 --> 16:53.053
Are you stalking me?

16:53.179 --> 16:54.180
Because I'm over
this whole

16:54.305 --> 16:55.682
"finding stalkers
attractive" thing.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.266
No, no, no,
I thought

16:57.391 --> 16:58.810
that maybe you'd want to go get

16:58.935 --> 16:59.769
something to eat
after your meeting.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.562
Yeah, I don't know.
Come on.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.105
Give a guy a break.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.272
Those were gourmet jelly beans

17:04.397 --> 17:06.066
and I got carpal tunnel
from sorting. You owe me.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.779
Right. I owe you.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.281
HARRY:
Annie!

17:20.122 --> 17:23.334
That's the second time she
snuck out since we moved here.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.169
We know she's
at Silver's.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.587
Let her stay there
for the night.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.464
No way. We didn't give her
permission.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.341
We just dropped a huge bomb
on her.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.050
She's acting out.

17:32.343 --> 17:35.262
She won't talk to me.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.557
Harry, when she's ready
to talk to you, she will.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.434
We have to trust her.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.310
ALL:
Cheers.

17:47.358 --> 17:47.817
Yeah!

17:47.942 --> 17:49.151
Lime!

17:49.276 --> 17:49.652
Mm...

17:49.777 --> 17:50.570
(squealing)

17:50.695 --> 17:52.488
(all laugh)

17:52.613 --> 17:53.447
Way to go, Kansas.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.074
(shrieks)

17:58.578 --> 18:00.204
You sure you don't want
another one?

18:00.329 --> 18:01.163
I am done for the night.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.373
Okay, Annie?

18:02.498 --> 18:05.292
Mm, S-T-L me.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.627
We're out of lime.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.379
Then just "T" me,
I guess.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.589
It works.

18:09.714 --> 18:13.300
All right.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.094
BOTH:
Cheers.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.807
Mm.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.141
Ah!

18:21.267 --> 18:23.477
(groans)

18:23.603 --> 18:25.897
We so should do this
at my birthday party.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.524
What party?
My 16th birthday party.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.402
My folks said I can invite
anybody that I want.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.487
I don't think the 'rents meant
that you could invite

18:33.613 --> 18:34.447
Mr. Tequila here.

18:34.572 --> 18:37.157
Yeah, no.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.285
(doorbell rings)

18:39.410 --> 18:40.327
Ooh, I got it.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.579
We should play
a game. Here.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.457
Twister!
Lame.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.417
Hello? You don't play
Twister unless there's
guys around.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.710
Why would you entangle your
limbs with another girl's

18:47.835 --> 18:49.420
unless a boy's watching?

18:49.545 --> 18:51.422
Hey, I'm glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.633
Adrianna!

18:53.758 --> 18:55.342
You have to come
to my birthday party, okay?

18:55.468 --> 18:56.552
Drunk?

18:56.677 --> 18:57.845
Getting there.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.597
I Never.

18:59.722 --> 19:00.848
What are you talking about?

19:00.974 --> 19:02.683
You've been drunk, like,
a million billion times.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.770
Okay, Kansas, "I Never"
is a game.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.272
(laughs)
All right, so, I say

19:08.397 --> 19:09.816
something that
I've never done

19:09.941 --> 19:12.568
and whoever has,
takes a drink.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.029
I'm gonna start.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.365
I have never...
had sex before.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.533
Oh!

19:24.497 --> 19:25.873
Okay, what are you waiting for?
Dixon's adorable.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.500
ANNIE:
Okay, Dixon's sister

19:27.625 --> 19:29.335
in the room
and getting nauseous.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.672
I'm just waiting
for the right time is all.

19:32.797 --> 19:35.257
Oh, please, it's not like
angels start singing.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.843
Right? You go.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.929
Okay, my turn.
I've never...

19:41.639 --> 19:44.266
I have never been in love.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.185
ALL:
Aw!

19:48.646 --> 19:50.690
Really? Never?

19:50.815 --> 19:52.525
Nope. Don't get sappy
about it.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.693
(all laugh)

19:53.818 --> 19:55.444
Annie, your turn.

19:55.569 --> 20:00.366
I... I've never been drunk.

20:00.491 --> 20:03.828
(all exclaim)

20:03.953 --> 20:05.705
Drink, drink,
drink, drink.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.712
You know, when Dixon
first came to live with us,

20:12.837 --> 20:15.589
I completely
flipped out.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.757
I actually fantasized

20:16.883 --> 20:18.592
about putting him in
a cardboard box

20:18.718 --> 20:20.594
and mailing him off
to Taiwan.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.972
(all laugh)

20:23.097 --> 20:25.641
I don't know. I guess I thought,
like, my parents

20:25.766 --> 20:26.767
would love him more
or something.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.102
I still feel crappy about it.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.938
Meanwhile, my darling sister
won't even answer my calls.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.648
It's awesome.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.274
I was kind of hoping
to start fresh

20:34.400 --> 20:35.484
with that new brother of ours.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.402
What?

20:36.527 --> 20:37.695
You know, my dad's been

20:37.820 --> 20:39.488
cheating on my mom
for a few years.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.158
My mother tramps around
like a Pussycat Doll,

20:42.282 --> 20:44.785
and God forbid I'd ever want
to talk to my sister about it.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.705
I was kind of hoping to have
a relationship with someone

20:47.830 --> 20:48.622
who doesn't make me

20:48.748 --> 20:49.916
want to scream
all the time.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.877
Sometimes, I just, you know,
feel so alone.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.003
Hey, you're not alone.
You have me.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.338
And these bitches, right?

20:56.463 --> 20:57.548
(all laugh)

20:57.673 --> 20:59.800
Holy moly!

20:59.926 --> 21:02.553
My shirt totally matches
your nail polish

21:02.678 --> 21:03.763
perfectly!

21:03.888 --> 21:05.932
Holy moly, Kansas!

21:06.057 --> 21:07.474
You're right, it does.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.769
Let's trade shirts.

21:09.894 --> 21:10.853
Okay.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.271
(laughs)

21:15.733 --> 21:17.651
(laughing)

21:17.777 --> 21:19.904
Yours... and mine.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.321
All right.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.490
Hey, hey! Whoa!

21:23.616 --> 21:25.367
Come on.
Annie, shirt on!

21:25.492 --> 21:26.493
No boys!

21:26.619 --> 21:28.537
What, uh, kind
of party is this?

21:28.662 --> 21:30.539
Dixon!

21:30.664 --> 21:31.582
Zip me.

21:31.707 --> 21:32.917
(grunts)

21:34.794 --> 21:38.714
I am so sorry that I
wanted to mail you to Taiwan.

21:38.839 --> 21:39.966
Are you drunk?

21:40.091 --> 21:42.301
S.T.L., baby! Whoo!

21:43.677 --> 21:45.638
Hi, Ethan!
Hey.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.014
Okay, um...

21:47.140 --> 21:48.390
Are you gonna come to my
birthday party next week?

21:48.515 --> 21:49.934
Everybody's invited!

21:50.059 --> 21:52.019
Yes.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.353
(all laugh)
Yes.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.524
You're a mess.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.486
Hi.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.822
Word on the street is
there's a party going on.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.824
Did you tell people
I was having a party?

22:04.949 --> 22:07.827
DIXON:
Naw, I just told Navid and maybe
a couple other people.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.746
(laughing)

22:10.871 --> 22:13.040
Oh, there's boys--

22:13.166 --> 22:14.959
now I have to give a crap
what I look like.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.796
(chuckling)

22:21.007 --> 22:24.635
♪ It's better than you find,
but you don't know ♪

22:24.760 --> 22:28.388
♪ You can't see what you show ♪

22:28.514 --> 22:29.974
You made it.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.558
I got your text.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.644
I'm not one to miss a party.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.106
Thought you
might be thirsty.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.858
I thought you were going to find
me something stronger.

22:38.983 --> 22:42.528
Uh, yeah, no trouble,
no trouble.

22:44.113 --> 22:47.574
I got you covered.
Be right back.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.618
Hey, Adrianna.

22:49.743 --> 22:52.579
So...

22:52.705 --> 22:54.081
we should celebrate.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.500
Celebrate what?

22:56.625 --> 22:58.418
Your testicles
have finally dropped?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.629
(laughing)
No.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.506
You getting
out of rehab.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.432
So, you just couldn't
stay away from me,

23:12.558 --> 23:14.810
could you?
(chuckles)

23:14.935 --> 23:16.520
You know it's like
Mother Hubbard territory
in here, right?

23:16.645 --> 23:17.938
This girl's got
nothing to eat.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.608
(chuckles)
What, so you're a food snob
or something?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.110
I prefer epicurean.

23:23.236 --> 23:24.737
Oh.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.906
And you're cooking?

23:27.031 --> 23:29.533
Yeah. You just gonna
stand there or you
gonna help me out?

23:29.658 --> 23:30.826
(laughs)

23:30.951 --> 23:32.494
GUY:
Yo, Ozzie.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.038
Naomi, this is my
buddy, Julio.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.581
Hey, what's up?
Hola.

23:35.706 --> 23:38.667
¿Como esta?

23:38.792 --> 23:41.754
Naomi, it's Ozzie.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.006
Yes, it is.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.008
And that's Julio,
his friend.
Hi.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.010
And this is us going.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.427
Excuse us for a second.

23:51.305 --> 23:53.391
Darling, listen.
Very important.

23:53.515 --> 23:56.602
Julio is Ozzie's as his wingman;
I need you to be my winggirl.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.646
Okay, um, you want me
to be your ring girl...

23:59.772 --> 24:01.648
No, no, no, wing...
winggirl.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.983
Okay. Listen.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.526
Julio's cute, right?
He's cute.

24:04.651 --> 24:06.695
You're single. Help me out here.

24:06.820 --> 24:10.699
Um, he's cute,
and I am very single.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.244
Not a boyfriend in sight.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.037
Perfect, fabulous.
Okay, so what you're

24:15.162 --> 24:18.999
going to do is keep
Julio very busy while
Naomi get's Ozzie alone.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.626
Okay. I am her winggirl.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.712
Just winging it.
Hello.

24:23.837 --> 24:28.550
♪ ♪

24:33.097 --> 24:34.848
GIRL:
God, what are
you doing?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.935
What's up, Adrianna?

24:40.062 --> 24:43.274
Okay, I hope this doesn't
come off as totally tacky,

24:43.399 --> 24:45.651
but could you hook me up
with your dealer?

24:45.776 --> 24:48.279
I don't do drugs anymore.

24:48.404 --> 24:52.616
So you don't really need
your dealer's number, do you?

24:53.867 --> 24:55.786
Fine.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.712
Psst. Hey.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.257
Hey.

25:08.382 --> 25:09.925
I heard the slumber party turned
into a party party,

25:10.050 --> 25:11.760
so I thought I'd come by
and check it out.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.137
How are you doing?
I'm cool.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.306
Okay, uh... do you
want to go somewhere

25:15.431 --> 25:17.599
a little more private
like upstairs?

25:18.892 --> 25:20.727
Fine.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.604
Yeah, let's go.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.273
Okay... cool.

25:29.445 --> 25:30.528
NAOMI:
Mmm. This is the
most amazing

25:30.654 --> 25:32.572
grilled cheese I have ever had
in my life.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.408
You're just drunk.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.369
(chuckles)
No, I'm not, actually.

25:36.494 --> 25:39.246
So, who taught
you how to cook?

25:39.372 --> 25:40.580
My dad.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.208
He worked in a bunch
of kitchens,

25:42.333 --> 25:44.001
saved his money and opened

25:44.126 --> 25:45.294
a hole in the wall
in Echo Park.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.587
Now that hole in the wall just
got written up in LA Weekly,

25:47.713 --> 25:49.840
so we're booked
six weeks in advance.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.676
Awesome.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.012
You know, you're not like
anybody at school.

25:55.137 --> 25:58.391
I'm like a lot
of people at school.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.059
Just not people
you hang out with.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.519
You should travel
outside your comfort zone.

26:01.643 --> 26:04.146
Oh, is that
what you're trying to do?

26:04.271 --> 26:06.273
Throw me off my game?

26:06.399 --> 26:08.067
Revealing choice of words.

26:08.192 --> 26:11.487
You like games, huh?

26:11.611 --> 26:15.032
Oh, you know, they're...
pretty entertaining.

26:15.157 --> 26:18.327
I don't like games, and I don't
like people who play games.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.622
Yo, this party's dead,
let's bounce.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.417
What happened to Annie?
Your girl?

26:24.542 --> 26:27.211
Dissed me--
let's get out of here.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.587
All right.
Let's get out of here.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.978
Annie.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.940
Annie!

26:52.403 --> 26:55.072
I'm really supposed
to be chatting with
what's-his-name right now.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.156
Which what's-his-name?
Huh?

26:56.282 --> 26:57.741
Who?
Julio.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.076
ETHAN:
Who's Julio?

26:59.201 --> 27:00.077
(laughing):
What's-his-name.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.620
Come on.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.670
Annie.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.845
Naomi! I am so happy

27:18.971 --> 27:20.889
you decided to
come to my party.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.766
I've really missed
hanging out with you.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.394
Well, that's pathetic...
uh, but sweet.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.271
I've missed you too.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.565
Awesome. Hey. Why
don't you catch me up

27:29.731 --> 27:31.275
on everything that's
been going on, yeah?

27:31.400 --> 27:33.402
ANNOUNCER (over TV):
...more than two million tons

27:33.527 --> 27:36.155
of fish hauled out
of this river every year.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.910
There are over 1,000 species
of fish in these waters...

27:49.251 --> 27:51.337
More large fish occur
in the Mekong

27:51.462 --> 27:54.923
than in any other river
in the world.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.384
This may be because
of the river's amazingly high

27:57.510 --> 28:02.097
productivity and large expanses
of flood plain habitat.

28:05.434 --> 28:06.852
It's size and length...

28:06.977 --> 28:10.314
(moaning)

28:10.439 --> 28:12.399
(moaning)

28:12.525 --> 28:14.067
You're sexy...

28:14.193 --> 28:16.987
(both laugh)

28:19.198 --> 28:21.074
I'm sleepy.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.369
Great.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.580
Okay.

28:26.704 --> 28:29.333
Okay, I'm... I'm gonna
get you some water.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.377
Water sounds delicious.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.963
(groans)

28:35.088 --> 28:38.008
I'll just be here... waiting.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.351
(both laughing)

28:51.522 --> 28:53.357
I think I have
a condom in my purse.

28:53.482 --> 28:54.441
NAVID:
I didn't think that was going
to happen tonight.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.276
Whoa.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.819
Okay, let's do this.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.530
What's going on?

28:59.655 --> 29:02.658
(chuckles)
You wanted to have sex;
let's have sex.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.868
But it's like
you're not even into it.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.953
(laughs)
Come on, Navid.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.872
I wasn't born yesterday.

29:08.997 --> 29:12.251
You covered my rehab,
so I'm paying you back.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.877
Is that what this is about?

29:14.002 --> 29:16.714
There's no such thing
as a free lunch.

29:16.838 --> 29:20.593
Okay, so because I
paid for your rehab you
think I expect sex?

29:20.718 --> 29:22.261
Is that the kind of guy
you think I am?

29:22.386 --> 29:24.304
Kiss me.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.889
Oh my God.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.516
You know what?
No, I'm done.

29:27.641 --> 29:28.434
Navid, wait!

29:28.559 --> 29:30.644
No, I'm out of here.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.187
Sorry to waste your time.
(door slams)

29:32.312 --> 29:34.064
ANNOUNCER (over TV):
...celebrity status
among locals, who live

29:34.189 --> 29:38.151
and depend upon the Mekong River
for their livelihoods.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.118
NAOMI:
There you are!

29:49.413 --> 29:53.083
I'm warn you,
this floor is very wobbly.

29:53.208 --> 29:57.045
(chuckles)

29:57.170 --> 29:58.380
Um... okay, what happened?

29:58.505 --> 29:59.381
I thought you were
going to be my...

29:59.506 --> 30:01.300
Wing girl.

30:01.425 --> 30:02.426
I'm sorry, Naomi.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.511
It's okay.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.388
I just don't get Ozzie.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.473
He's so weird.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.933
One second, we're flirting,

30:10.058 --> 30:12.227
he's cooking, and everything's
cool, and then...

30:12.352 --> 30:16.774
all of sudden, he says, "I don't
play games, I'm out of here."

30:16.940 --> 30:18.358
I think I'm gonna try
something radical with Ozzie.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.485
What's that?

30:19.610 --> 30:21.487
Honesty.

30:23.196 --> 30:26.325
It's not exactly me,
per se.

30:27.618 --> 30:29.745
But I am sick of the lies.

30:29.869 --> 30:33.457
I mean, my dad's having
an affair... no one tells me.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.167
Apparently, I have a brother.

30:35.292 --> 30:36.876
No one tells me.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.671
Everyone's
so full of it.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.341
I'm really sick
of being lied to.

30:43.592 --> 30:44.551
I feel terrible.

30:44.677 --> 30:48.180
I know.
You do?

30:48.305 --> 30:50.098
About your dad? Yeah.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.809
Sure, I get it.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.436
I mean, it seemed like
you really looked up to him.

30:54.561 --> 30:55.437
Yeah.

30:55.562 --> 30:56.980
I did.

30:57.105 --> 31:00.442
When I was little, I
thought he was just like

31:00.567 --> 31:04.070
Superman or something.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.490
And he turned out to be
a liar like all the rest.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.408
Yeah. I don't like liars.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.036
Yeah, it's a bummer.

31:11.161 --> 31:13.622
Well, any-whoo,

31:13.747 --> 31:15.582
I'm going to go fix my makeup.

31:15.708 --> 31:18.335
Apparently, there are still
a bunch of boys around here.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.678
Hey, cutie...

31:27.803 --> 31:30.138
I heard there was
some shirt swapping

31:30.263 --> 31:31.515
going on earlier
tonight.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.769
You want to switch
shirts with me?

31:35.894 --> 31:37.646
Only if I can do your nails
and makeup first.

31:37.771 --> 31:40.106
If that's what
you're into.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.900
Oh, my God, get away from me.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.324
Hey...

31:49.449 --> 31:51.493
Hey.

31:51.618 --> 31:52.745
We need to talk.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.539
Yeah, I've been
looking for you.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.457
Yeah, I've been
talking and thinking

31:57.583 --> 31:58.500
and we need to talk.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.419
I can't lie like this.

32:00.544 --> 32:03.589
Listen, Annie, let's talk about
this tomorrow when you're sober.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.215
I'm not drunk.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.217
Actually, I think you are.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.261
Actually, no I'm not.

32:09.386 --> 32:10.763
I'm totally not.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.433
Wait... hold on.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.437
(retching)

32:20.689 --> 32:23.024
Thanks for
coming to get me.

32:23.149 --> 32:24.735
How was the party?
Was it ragin'?

32:24.860 --> 32:26.528
Things were starting
to get pretty wild.

32:26.653 --> 32:27.987
Should we do something
about it, or...?

32:28.113 --> 32:29.531
I already called a colleague.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.949
Look at you.

33:03.732 --> 33:04.650
Hey.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.234
Everybody, listen--

33:06.359 --> 33:07.068
party's over.

33:07.193 --> 33:08.278
Let's go.
Um...

33:08.403 --> 33:09.655
Come on.

33:09.780 --> 33:12.240
Hey, um, Dad...

33:12.365 --> 33:13.408
Got a call from
a colleague.

33:13.533 --> 33:14.701
Said this party

33:14.827 --> 33:16.620
was out of control, and
that Annie was inebriated.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.204
GUY:
I'm gonna bounce.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.331
Annie?

33:19.456 --> 33:21.166
Drunk? What?

33:21.291 --> 33:22.334
Uh, Principal Wilson,

33:22.459 --> 33:23.877
we collected
everybody's keys,

33:24.002 --> 33:27.005
and already called
a bunch of cabs.
Yeah.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.306
Oh, honey.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.308
Oh, Daddy...

33:38.433 --> 33:40.226
I drank too much.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.646
Yeah, I can see that.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.398
Oh, sweetheart, you stink.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.066
I threw up.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.486
Yeah, I figured.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.530
You okay?

33:51.655 --> 33:54.115
No.

33:54.240 --> 33:58.453
No. I'm not okay.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.163
It's your fault.

34:02.290 --> 34:06.670
I'm not okay with you
having a son.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.672
And I'm not okay that
you kept him a secret

34:09.797 --> 34:11.466
from us.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.385
And I know... I know
you didn't want it

34:13.510 --> 34:14.719
to affect us, Dad, but it...

34:14.844 --> 34:16.679
it affected me.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.639
Hmm.

34:18.764 --> 34:23.101
And you weren't honest.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.855
For two months you
were a liar.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.774
And now I have
to be honest,

34:27.900 --> 34:30.485
and I have to tell
you that it made me

34:30.610 --> 34:33.279
so mad at you
for not being honest,

34:33.405 --> 34:34.907
because secrets--

34:35.032 --> 34:37.409
they just make me
feel so sick...

34:37.534 --> 34:38.744
and wobbly.

34:38.869 --> 34:42.789
And everything's
a big mess now.

34:42.915 --> 34:45.542
And I have vomit boots!

34:45.667 --> 34:46.752
You have "vomit boots"?

34:46.877 --> 34:50.505
Ah, you have vomit boots.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.257
Oh, sweetheart,

34:52.382 --> 34:55.677
I'm sorry that I wasn't honest.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.345
And I'm sorry that I acted

34:57.470 --> 35:00.807
like it wouldn't
be a big deal.

35:00.933 --> 35:05.186
Tried to do the right thing,
and I didn't.

35:06.855 --> 35:08.523
I'm not perfect, Annie.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.150
I make mistakes.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.862
That's okay.

35:16.531 --> 35:20.452
Are you going to let me
get you out of here?

35:20.577 --> 35:21.912
Yes, please.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.497
We're going to have
to stand up.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.417
Hey, Daddy, tell
me the truth--

35:27.542 --> 35:29.335
am I in big trouble?

35:29.461 --> 35:32.464
Well, we all make mistakes.

35:32.589 --> 35:36.426
Hey, Dad, I made
another mistake.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.720
I cannot return
these vomit boots.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.388
Yeah, I kind
of figured that.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.682
Hey, Dad...

35:42.808 --> 35:44.726
you know who you
remind me of?

35:44.851 --> 35:45.769
Who?

35:45.894 --> 35:47.771
Superman...

35:47.896 --> 35:49.314
only not so big
into the tights,

35:49.439 --> 35:52.400
thank goodness.
Okay.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.277
(squeals)

36:05.497 --> 36:07.540
I want back on the lacrosse
team, Mr. Matthews.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.709
My six-week
suspension is up.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.711
That's true, George,
but your grades are down,

36:11.837 --> 36:13.546
right, and you know
the school policy.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.633
You need a 3.0
or higher to get

36:16.758 --> 36:17.759
back on the field.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.218
Then give me an "A"
in your class.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.470
Why would I do that?

36:20.595 --> 36:22.848
Oh, I can think
of a pretty good reason.

36:22.973 --> 36:23.849
RYAN:
He only saw us

36:23.974 --> 36:25.517
in a car together.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.894
Teachers cannot be alone
off campus with students.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.521
Right, but...

36:29.646 --> 36:31.023
Kim's not a student.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.941
KIMBERLY:
I am as far as the kids know.

36:33.066 --> 36:35.568
If anyone finds out who I am,
I could be in serious trouble.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.654
I'm sorry, Ryan,

36:37.779 --> 36:40.115
but I'm gonna have to ask
you to take a paid leave

36:40.239 --> 36:41.449
of absence,
effective immediately.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.702
This is my job,
Harry, my reputation.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.453
What are the students going
to think?

36:45.578 --> 36:47.622
We will reinstate you
as soon as Kimberly's work

36:47.747 --> 36:49.207
is done here.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.503
I'm sorry.

36:53.628 --> 36:54.671
I'm sorry, too, Ryan.

36:54.796 --> 36:56.756
This is not fair.

36:56.882 --> 36:57.799
You know, you got to
take responsibility

36:57.924 --> 36:59.300
for your actions here.

36:59.425 --> 37:00.969
What you did-- it
wasn't illegal, but...

37:01.094 --> 37:02.345
it wasn't
quite appropriate either.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.892
(door opens)

37:16.735 --> 37:19.696
Can we talk?

37:21.406 --> 37:22.866
Yeah.

37:28.329 --> 37:29.956
Look, I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.625
Okay?

37:32.751 --> 37:34.753
It's just nice guys aren't
usually interested in me,

37:34.878 --> 37:36.838
and I thought...

37:36.963 --> 37:38.256
That I was a sleazebag.

37:40.759 --> 37:44.387
Yeah.
You know how many directors
have lied to me and used me?

37:44.512 --> 37:47.933
They act like these
nice guys and...

37:49.142 --> 37:50.977
You're a nice guy, Navid,

37:51.103 --> 37:52.478
and I guess
I got scared.

37:52.604 --> 37:53.980
Hey, that's terrible,

37:54.106 --> 37:57.358
but sometimes a nice guy
who acts like he likes you

37:57.483 --> 38:00.028
is just a nice guy
who likes you.

38:00.153 --> 38:01.988
But you paid
for my rehab.

38:02.114 --> 38:03.364
Because I care about you.

38:03.489 --> 38:04.950
(chuckles)

38:05.075 --> 38:06.701
No, I, I know that now.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.621
I just-- I guess...

38:09.746 --> 38:10.663
if we're going
to be together...

38:10.789 --> 38:11.873
Wait.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.625
You want to be with me?

38:13.750 --> 38:16.419
Well, yeah.

38:16.544 --> 38:17.670
(chuckles)

38:17.796 --> 38:21.382
I kind of like spending
time with you and you're...

38:21.507 --> 38:23.551
kind of an
amazing kisser.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.470
I am?

38:25.595 --> 38:28.306
(both chuckle)

38:28.431 --> 38:30.433
But you don't, you
don't have to do this.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.769
You can, you can
walk away right now.

38:43.071 --> 38:45.073
How about we
walk together?

38:47.075 --> 38:49.911
(chuckles)

38:50.036 --> 38:51.579
That was pretty sappy.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.791
Yeah, it's one of the side
effects of being a nice guy.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.419
I think I still have
a hangover.

38:58.544 --> 38:59.545
Yeah, you
were a little...

38:59.671 --> 39:00.630
A lot.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.423
Was a lot.
(both chuckle)

39:02.548 --> 39:05.718
So you wanted
to talk?

39:05.844 --> 39:09.973
Yeah, um...

39:10.098 --> 39:12.017
I don't want to keep us
a secret anymore, Ethan.

39:12.142 --> 39:15.394
It's wrong
to lie to Naomi

39:15.520 --> 39:16.479
over and over again,

39:16.604 --> 39:18.064
and I think we just need
to tell her

39:18.190 --> 39:20.108
and we just need
to accept

39:20.233 --> 39:22.568
whatever consequences
are going to come.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.114
Please?

39:26.239 --> 39:28.658
Okay.

39:29.951 --> 39:31.494
If that's what you want.

39:31.619 --> 39:32.871
Yeah, that's what I want.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.960

39:47.886 --> 39:49.470
Hi.

39:49.595 --> 39:52.598
What's up?

39:52.724 --> 39:54.684
I don't want to
play games with you.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.144
(chuckles)

39:56.269 --> 39:58.021
That's crafty.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.106
The "I don't want
to play games" game.

40:00.232 --> 40:01.607
(chuckling):
I'm serious.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.401
Ozzie, I like you.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.112
I'll tell you what.
This is my number.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.241
You call me.

40:09.366 --> 40:12.077
Don't wait three days,
don't wait a week.
