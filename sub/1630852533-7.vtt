[eerie music playing]

00:01.402 --> 00:03.168
[woman]
<i>  It could literally be anyone</i>

00:03.170 --> 00:07.539
<i>  who is haunting this place</i>
<i>  that has lived in this house</i>
<i>  in the last 250 years.</i>

00:09.977 --> 00:13.212
<i>  You have the curator here</i>
<i>  telling us things are getting</i>
<i>  more extreme.</i>

00:13.214 --> 00:14.446
This is my house.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.685
[distorted shouting] Ohh!

00:19.687 --> 00:23.188
This is a very small ritual
that will allow us

00:23.190 --> 00:26.158
to make you
a little bit closer
to the other side.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.693
We become ghosts?

00:31.799 --> 00:33.332
<i> [Amy] The dead want a voice.</i>

00:33.334 --> 00:35.000
We just wanna help
this family.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.201
<i> [Adam] The living need</i>
<i>  our help.</i>

00:36.203 --> 00:37.836
Have you always been here?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.471
He was watching already.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.679
[opening theme music playing]

00:52.053 --> 00:53.285
[eerie music playing]

00:53.287 --> 00:56.188
-[Amy] Holy Moly.
-[Adam] Wow.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.090
-This isn't...
-[Adam] This was built
before America.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.958
1772.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.027
[Amy]
And the original family
who built this,

01:02.029 --> 01:04.196
they stayed here until 1995.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.498
And it became a museum
in the year 2000.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.137
Normally, we are called in by
the actual, like owner

01:12.139 --> 01:13.739
or the families themselves.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.207
But, in this case,

01:15.209 --> 01:17.543
we were called in
by the museum's curator

01:17.545 --> 01:20.345
and a team she brought in,
New Jersey Paranormal,

01:20.347 --> 01:22.915
who is led by our friend,
John Ruggiero.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.350
He's realizing that his team
needs help with this one.

01:26.821 --> 01:29.321
I mean,
people are getting scratched,
they are getting pushed,

01:29.323 --> 01:31.824
tons of people who work here
think this place is haunted,

01:31.826 --> 01:33.926
and the fact that
the activities picked up

01:33.928 --> 01:35.427
and seems aggressive.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.296
Wondering what we are
getting ourselves into though.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.264
I know. I mean,
one family here

01:39.266 --> 01:41.033
-for 200 years.
-Yeah.

01:41.035 --> 01:43.368
[Amy] Who knows
what went on in this place.

01:47.808 --> 01:48.874
-Oh, yes.
-Hello.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.576
-Good to see you.
-John, good to see you.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.544
-Hi, good to see you.
-Hi, welcome to Liberty Hall.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.880
[Amy]
So good to see you.
Good to see you, John.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.081
This is beautiful.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.316
So glad you're here.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.784
[both] Thank you.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.018
[Amy] Wow.

02:00.688 --> 02:04.056
[Adam] Oh, my God.
This is incredible.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.928
I know there's
a lot of information here
given that

02:09.930 --> 02:12.231
the same family was here
for a number of years.

02:12.233 --> 02:15.067
That family was here
till 1995.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.903
How did the house become
what it is now?

02:17.905 --> 02:20.939
Uh, the last resident
of the house,
Mary Alice Barney Kean,

02:20.941 --> 02:22.274
uh, it was her

02:22.276 --> 02:24.843
desire to have this turned
into a museum.

02:24.845 --> 02:28.514
So, she entrusted the house
to her children, and
asked them to do that.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.982
And they followed through
with her wish.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.350
And, uh,

02:31.352 --> 02:33.886
established a foundation
and made this into a museum.

02:33.888 --> 02:36.321
[Adam] And so her children,
are they still living?

02:36.323 --> 02:37.356
-Just one.
-Just one.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.891
One of the three
are still alive

02:38.893 --> 02:41.059
and uh,
still chairman of the board

02:41.061 --> 02:42.961
-and still very active
in the museum.
-Wow.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.864
-I love that.
Okay, that's so cool.
-Incredible.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.933
[Adam] So, John,
your group

02:47.935 --> 02:50.335
has investigated
this property and

02:50.337 --> 02:53.338
you can show us where
the paranormal activities

02:53.340 --> 02:56.108
mostly happening
and talk about your group.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.910
Because I know
something has changed.

02:57.912 --> 03:00.012
The activity has gotten
more aggressive, yeah?

03:00.014 --> 03:01.747
-Definitely, we've had
some experiences.
-Okay.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.683
Again, we were told about
some things that were
happening here.

03:04.685 --> 03:09.254
But, we experienced things
things that were beyond
what we were told.

03:09.256 --> 03:11.423
-Okay. And that happens
sometimes too.
-For sure.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.792
-Yeah.
-Like, when you start
reaching out things get more

03:13.794 --> 03:15.027
-excited, so...
-Right.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.929
Have you ever had
any activity?

03:16.931 --> 03:19.231
We've had a lot of activity
over the years.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.699
Many of our guests,

03:20.701 --> 03:22.668
and our staff
are a little uncomfortable.

03:22.670 --> 03:26.038
And so we wanted to
kinda get to the bottom of
the things we were hearing.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.906
-Okay.
-And that is when
you called in John?

03:27.908 --> 03:29.741
-That is when I called in
John.
-[Amy] Okay, perfect.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.109
John, if you could
take us around

03:31.111 --> 03:33.679
and just show us where
the paranormal hotspots are

03:33.681 --> 03:35.814
and then we can
reconnect with you
on history later.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.016
-That sounds great.
-All right, perfect.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.017
-[John] Ready?
-After you.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.219
We'll follow you.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.223
[intense music playing]

03:44.225 --> 03:46.692
[John]
Second floor is very active.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.061
I want to show you
this spot first.

03:49.964 --> 03:52.164
This was
the servants' quarters.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.465
[Amy] That's a strange room.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.467
We had one of our team members

03:55.869 --> 03:57.536
standing in that doorway

03:57.538 --> 04:00.305
and she jumped and said,
"Something touched me."

04:00.307 --> 04:03.242
Who does she remind you of?

04:03.510 --> 04:05.410
Oh, my God.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.112
I gotta get out of here.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.315
-[man] What's going on?
-[bleep]

04:10.317 --> 04:12.384
-She's frightened.
-[woman groans]

04:12.886 --> 04:14.853
[man] She smacked her head

04:14.855 --> 04:17.522
and she took off.
And something was right here.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.325
It like, like it shot
off of her

04:20.327 --> 04:22.194
and was right here.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.999
And she looked up
and saw a male figure walking

04:27.001 --> 04:29.101
along the,
yeah, top of the stairs.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.302
[Adam] Just walking across?

04:30.304 --> 04:33.305
Yes, walking
along the hallway.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.407
-We're gonna go upstairs now.
-[Amy] Oh, boy.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.043
[floor creaking]

04:44.018 --> 04:47.552
[John] This room belonged to
Captain John.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.122
They laid out his body
on the bed after he passed.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.658
Lots of activity.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.893
The cleaning person was here
by herself.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.494
She saw Captain John

04:56.496 --> 04:59.498
come out of that mirror
when she was in this room
and go walk down the hallway.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.233
Okay.

05:01.235 --> 05:03.368
That was one of the reasons
why we were called in

05:03.370 --> 05:07.172
because she had never seen
or heard anything like that
before

05:07.174 --> 05:09.308
and all of a sudden
things got worse.

05:09.376 --> 05:10.375
Wow.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.044
And I got a scratch.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.647
I didn't know who it was.
I'm thinking,

05:15.649 --> 05:17.816
why would Captain John
do that to me

05:17.818 --> 05:19.785
-[Adam] Mm-Hmm.
-Because I'm in his bedroom.

05:19.787 --> 05:24.056
But, it was more of an
aggressive style
of interaction

05:24.058 --> 05:25.657
-than we have
ever gotten before.
-Yeah.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.025
And that continued.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.660
So, very active room?

05:28.662 --> 05:29.861
-Yes.
-Very active room.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.897
Probably one of the most
active rooms in the entire

05:31.899 --> 05:33.031
-mansion.
-Okay.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.538
[Amy]
Okay, so this was his wife's'

05:39.540 --> 05:40.805
-Yes.
-room?

05:40.807 --> 05:44.509
This room belonged
to Mary Alice,
the wife of Captain John.

05:44.511 --> 05:48.146
This was another room where
our teammate, Kenny,
was sitting about here

05:48.148 --> 05:50.349
and he kept saying to me

05:50.351 --> 05:53.552
I feel like something
is trying to break
through my jacket.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.987
And he kept saying

05:55.989 --> 05:58.156
it feels like fingers
are pressing on my jacket.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.425
Wow.

06:00.427 --> 06:04.262
[Amy] Was there anything
that you did during
investigation that was,

06:04.264 --> 06:08.266
that may have triggered
a more, you know,
aggressive response?

06:08.268 --> 06:09.301
Not in this room.

06:09.303 --> 06:10.202
Right.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.003
There was only one other room,

06:12.005 --> 06:15.173
I would say that we kind of
pushed the envelope
a little bit

06:15.175 --> 06:16.308
in terms of

06:16.310 --> 06:17.976
asking for more

06:17.978 --> 06:19.044
-clarification,
-[Amy] Ah.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.412
and interaction.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.314
-Okay.
-That seemed to aggravate
things a little more.

06:22.316 --> 06:23.382
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.483
All right, we'll follow you.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.151
Let's go into that room.

06:27.321 --> 06:30.222
-[Amy] Okay.
-So, this is the room
I was telling you about.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.823
We came in here
and we were getting

06:31.825 --> 06:34.192
immediate interaction
with all of our equipment.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.996
Getting some EVPs
that kept saying, "Go away,
go away."

06:41.068 --> 06:43.201
-Go away, again.
-Again?

06:45.672 --> 06:47.038
Right there. Go away.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.274
That time it was easier
to hear both words.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.676
Yeah,
I could hear that one better.

06:51.678 --> 06:54.146
And, I wanted to find out

06:54.148 --> 06:57.215
who we were talking to
and why they were acting
the way they were acting.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.549
So, I said,

06:58.551 --> 07:00.786
"If you really don't want us
here, touch that piece."

07:00.788 --> 07:02.354
And they were
lighting up everything.

07:02.356 --> 07:05.390
And then I said,
"Okay, one more time."

07:05.392 --> 07:08.260
And a voice said,
"I did your request."

07:08.262 --> 07:09.428
[distorted noise]

07:11.532 --> 07:13.665
-What is that?
-Holy [bleep]

07:14.168 --> 07:15.167
[whispers] Yes.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.907
I did your request.

07:21.909 --> 07:22.874
What!

07:22.876 --> 07:24.443
The voice was gravelly.

07:24.445 --> 07:25.911
-Right.
-And it was a man.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.079
-Okay.
-And he was agitated.

07:30.384 --> 07:31.950
-[Amy] All right, well...
-[Adam] Okay.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.352
We have a lot to do.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.688
<i> [Adam] John is a friend</i>
<i>  of ours, and he gave us</i>
<i>  the tour today</i>

07:36.690 --> 07:39.057
<i>  and you know,</i>
<i>  his tour really focused on</i>

07:39.059 --> 07:42.060
<i>  the activity that he</i>
<i>  and his friends</i>
<i>  have experienced</i>

07:42.062 --> 07:43.395
<i>  while in this space.</i>

07:43.397 --> 07:45.764
<i>  And they believe it's</i>
<i>  Captain John that was here.</i>

07:45.766 --> 07:47.632
<i>  And you know,</i>
<i>  that's a strong possibility.</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:49.668
<i>  He was the patriarch</i>
<i>  of the family,</i>

07:49.670 --> 07:52.103
<i>  it's his house and there is</i>
<i>  a strong possibility that</i>

07:52.105 --> 07:54.139
<i>  he is territorial</i>
<i>  and lashing out.</i>

07:54.141 --> 07:55.607
<i>  We're gonna call in Chip</i>

07:55.809 --> 07:58.276
<i>  because if there's anybody</i>
<i>  that can give</i>
<i>  an unbiased opinion</i>

07:58.278 --> 08:00.378
<i>  and be straight to the core,</i>

08:00.380 --> 08:01.279
<i>  It's gonna be Chip Coffey.</i>

08:01.281 --> 08:03.215
<i>  His family is big.</i>

08:03.217 --> 08:08.086
It spans hundreds of years
and we need a little
of his psychic intuition.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.687
[cell phone ringing]

08:11.992 --> 08:14.359
<i> -[Amy] Hey, Chip.</i>
<i>  How's it going?</i>
<i> -I'm good. How are you?</i>

08:14.862 --> 08:16.328
<i>  Very well. Thank you.</i>

08:16.330 --> 08:20.131
Um, have you gotten any
initial reads on where we are?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.266
<i> [Chip] Not so much.</i>

08:21.268 --> 08:23.668
Some little things
flash in my head. But,

08:23.670 --> 08:26.037
as soon as they are there,
they are gone.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.039
<i>  I'll, I'll try to focus</i>
<i>  in on it more.</i>

08:28.108 --> 08:29.241
Okay.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.346
You are in the north-east,
right?

08:36.917 --> 08:39.017
<i>  Where you really are,</i>
<i>  it's very old.</i>

08:39.019 --> 08:40.252
Mm-Hmm.

08:40.254 --> 08:42.587
<i>  I'm talking like, really old.</i>

08:42.789 --> 08:44.389
There's...

08:46.260 --> 08:49.094
a lot of death associated
with this place
that you are at.

08:49.396 --> 08:50.395
<i> [Amy] Uh-huh.</i>

08:50.397 --> 08:52.464
<i>  And that's all I got.</i>

08:52.466 --> 08:54.032
[both] Okay.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.035
Well, we have something
kind of uh, new to do with you

08:57.037 --> 08:58.970
just because there are
a number of

08:58.972 --> 09:01.273
people associated
with this space.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.174
<i>  I'm gonna switch the camera</i>
<i>  around</i>

09:03.176 --> 09:07.345
<i>  and then just kind of</i>
<i>  take you through photos.</i>

09:07.347 --> 09:10.348
<i>  Can you see what you</i>
<i>  can pick up from</i>
<i>  any of these people?</i>

09:10.350 --> 09:12.117
<i> [Chip] All right.</i>

09:17.357 --> 09:19.157
[Chip]
<i>  There's nothing that's</i>
<i>  really jumping out at me.</i>

09:19.159 --> 09:20.425
[Amy] Okay.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.027
<i> -[Amy] And these two.</i>
<i>  -Yeah.</i>

09:23.864 --> 09:24.996
Not much.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.364
<i> [Amy] Here we go.</i>

09:29.202 --> 09:31.403
<i> [Chip] I feel a lot of music</i>
<i>  around this woman.</i>

09:31.405 --> 09:33.438
She's very, she loves

09:33.440 --> 09:35.073
<i>  music and the arts and</i>

09:35.075 --> 09:38.143
and that kind of thing.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.377
<i> [Amy] All right.</i>

09:39.379 --> 09:41.012
We just have a couple more.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.686
Okay, this is very weird guys.

09:48.956 --> 09:52.324
It's almost... on my screen
it's like this photograph

09:52.326 --> 09:54.993
-or this painting is 3D.
-[Amy] Ah.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.096
I could swear to God,
I'm seeing him move.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.397
<i> [Amy] Hmm.</i>

10:00.300 --> 10:01.900
<i>  He is,</i>

10:01.902 --> 10:03.101
<i>  it's so screwed up.</i>

10:03.103 --> 10:06.938
<i>  I'm seeing him</i>
<i>  actually moving</i>
<i>  in this image.</i>

10:06.940 --> 10:08.440
-That's interesting.
<i>  -And it's...</i>

10:11.378 --> 10:14.012
Focus in on whoever that is.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.647
<i>  Who is he? What's his name?</i>

10:16.550 --> 10:18.249
John, right?

10:18.485 --> 10:20.085
[bleep] me!

10:20.087 --> 10:22.520
I was gonna say,
"Who is John?"

10:23.523 --> 10:27.359
I'd focus in, 'cause I'm,
I'm really...

10:28.161 --> 10:30.462
kind of interested in,

10:30.464 --> 10:32.263
weirded out by that.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.498
<i> -[Amy] Okay.</i>
<i> -Um,</i>

10:34.067 --> 10:35.533
that's all I got.

10:35.535 --> 10:38.970
Why is it that these
spirits don't ever
make it easy for us.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.171
<i> [Amy] I know.</i>

10:40.173 --> 10:43.341
<i>  Well, I think this concludes</i>
<i>  our tour of photos.</i>

10:43.343 --> 10:45.377
<i>  If you get any other pings,</i>

10:45.379 --> 10:48.079
<i>  if you get any other hits,</i>
<i>  just text them to us.</i>

10:48.081 --> 10:50.315
If I get anything else,
I'll let you know darlings.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.384
-Alright, awesome. Thank you
so much, Chip.
-Thank you, Chip.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.019
Thank you.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.424
[Amy] Where do we wanna go?
You wanna go...

10:59.426 --> 11:02.060
[Adam] Let's explore,
let's explore.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.329
[Amy] I mean,
I don't think
we can limit ourselves

11:04.331 --> 11:06.531
to where John had experiences.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.767
I think we have to
kinda cover this whole place.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.468
[Adam] Right, I agree.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.972
-You wanna go in here?
-[Adam] Yeah.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.909
[Adam] Hey,
let's do a quick EVP session.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.210
Okay.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.246
[Adam] If there's anyone here.
My name is Adam.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.814
I'm Amy.

11:22.816 --> 11:26.217
And you know our friend John.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.021
[Amy] If there's anyone
who wants to talk to us just

11:30.023 --> 11:33.158
go ahead and get as close to
one of these little red lights
as you can

11:33.160 --> 11:34.959
and speak as loudly
as you can.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.464
John said that he and
his friends speak to

11:39.866 --> 11:41.066
someone that

11:41.468 --> 11:43.068
is hard to see,

11:43.904 --> 11:46.004
it's hard to hear you.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.273
We wanna know what you want.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.341
What you need.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.144
[bell dinging]

11:56.450 --> 11:58.450
-What's the dinging?
-Dinging.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.386
[Adam] It's just like 'ding!'

12:02.422 --> 12:04.389
[Amy] The doorbell?

12:04.391 --> 12:07.358
-[Adam dings the doorbell]
-[Amy] No.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.630
[Amy] Is there a dinging?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.167
[clinking]

12:18.305 --> 12:19.337
[Amy] Something like that?

12:19.339 --> 12:21.372
[thuds]

12:21.374 --> 12:23.408
-[loud thuds]
-[Amy] What is happening?
Hold on.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.280
[intense music playing]

12:31.952 --> 12:33.284
[Adam] There's a bell thing
happening.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.320
[Amy] I don't know.
Bells are important,

12:35.322 --> 12:37.989
'cause that's how
they summoned their servants.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.192
Or they were trying to get us
to go to a different room.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.332
[thuds]

12:48.769 --> 12:51.436
-[thudding continues]
-[Adam] I'm sorry,
what in the actual...

12:54.307 --> 12:57.175
[Amy] There is a person here,
right?

12:57.177 --> 12:59.010
[Adam] There's another person
in here.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.312
[Amy] What the
[bleep] was that?

13:01.314 --> 13:04.115
[Adam] It didn't sound like
somebody was coming
down the stairs?

13:05.452 --> 13:08.787
[Amy] I don't know,
like, that was loud as [bleep]

13:08.789 --> 13:10.455
[Adam] I mean, It sounded like

13:10.457 --> 13:12.657
something was coming
towards us.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.361
That was an aggressive

13:16.363 --> 13:17.896
rapping sound.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.130
So, it was almost like,

13:19.132 --> 13:21.032
-I'll get your attention.
-Exactly.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.001
-Okay, that's...
-That's...

13:23.003 --> 13:24.669
-intelligent.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and also

13:25.338 --> 13:26.971
-Strong,
-A bit...

13:26.973 --> 13:28.339
-jarring.
-Mm-hm.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.074
Imagine being here by
yourself and you're just

13:30.076 --> 13:32.243
curating and doing your job
and that happens.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.678
[Adam] Yeah, that's scary.

13:34.948 --> 13:38.049
[Adam] Okay, let's do a quick
EVP session and just...

13:38.051 --> 13:41.452
Yeah, so, whoever did that

13:41.454 --> 13:45.089
whoever you are, we heard you
and we're listening.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.425
Can you just say as loudly
as you can,

13:47.427 --> 13:49.627
your first and last name?

13:52.299 --> 13:55.500
How many of you are still
here in this house?

13:58.905 --> 14:03.141
Are there multiple generations
of you in this house still?

14:05.946 --> 14:09.514
[Adam] Do you see
other people in this house,
that are like you?

14:09.516 --> 14:11.182
That are non-living?

14:11.184 --> 14:14.819
[suspenseful music playing]

14:14.821 --> 14:18.656
What does it mean, when
someone rang the bell
multiple times?

14:22.462 --> 14:25.196
Did you pass away
in this house?

14:28.235 --> 14:31.970
[eerie music playing]

14:31.972 --> 14:34.806
<i> [Amy on recording] Can you</i>
<i> just say as loudly as you can,</i>

14:34.808 --> 14:36.941
<i>  your first and last name?</i>

14:36.943 --> 14:41.045
<i>  How many of you are still</i>
<i>  here in the house?</i>

14:41.047 --> 14:45.250
<i> [Adam on recording] Are there</i>
<i>  multiple generations of you</i>
<i>  in this house still?</i>

14:45.252 --> 14:47.952
-[distortion]
-[both exclaiming] Oh!

14:47.954 --> 14:51.890
<i> [Adam on recording] Are there</i>
<i>  multiple generations of you</i>
<i>  in this house still?</i>

14:51.892 --> 14:54.325
-[distortion]
-I hear in this house.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.294
-Yeah, in this house.
-Yeah.

14:56.296 --> 15:00.064
<i> [Adam on recording] Do you see</i>
<i>  other people in this house,</i>
<i>  that are like you?</i>

15:00.066 --> 15:01.132
<i>  That are non-living?</i>

15:01.902 --> 15:03.200
Yes.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.304
[Amy on recording]
<i>  What does it mean, when</i>
<i>  someone rang</i>

15:06.306 --> 15:08.339
<i>  the bell multiple times?</i>

15:08.341 --> 15:11.175
<i> [Adam on recording] Did you</i>
<i>  pass away in this house?</i>

15:11.177 --> 15:12.243
[clicks machine]

15:12.245 --> 15:15.546
-I mean, so...
-A few vague answers.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.081
-I mean...
-But something talking.

15:17.083 --> 15:23.254
We've had bell ringing
over there, over here we had
a loud aggressive bang.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.790
So, and that's just the
first floor, but John said

15:25.792 --> 15:27.558
the second floor is
more active.

15:27.560 --> 15:31.162
Let's see what happens when we
come back armed with names,

15:31.164 --> 15:35.934
history, timelines and let's
throw that into the mix and
see what happens then.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.101
-Yeah, I agree.
-[sighs] Okay.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.570
[eerie music playing]

15:43.910 --> 15:47.045
<i> [Amy] So, we're about to meet</i>
<i>  with, Maryellen and Rachael.</i>

15:47.047 --> 15:49.347
<i>  Rachael is the Executive</i>
<i>  Director here at the museum,</i>

15:49.349 --> 15:52.450
<i>  and they have a ton of</i>
<i>  history to fill us in on.</i>

15:54.688 --> 15:58.289
So, the actual house was
built in 1772,

15:58.291 --> 16:01.859
um, for New Jersey's
first elected governor,
William Livingston.

16:01.861 --> 16:05.229
[Rachael] And our second
resident, the Kean family,

16:05.231 --> 16:07.865
moved into the house in 1811,

16:07.867 --> 16:12.203
And from 1811 until 1995,
we have been the
Kean family household.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.938
[Amy] Interesting, okay.

16:13.940 --> 16:17.942
Do we know how many passed
away in the house itself,
and do we have their names?

16:17.944 --> 16:19.911
[Rachael] I think just
five or six.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.780
The last person that died in
the house was Mary Alice.

16:22.782 --> 16:26.117
The only other person I would
mention is, Captain John Kean.

16:26.119 --> 16:30.254
Um, he died at the hospital
but then Mary Alice

16:30.256 --> 16:34.025
brought him home and actually
laid him out in the red room.

16:34.027 --> 16:38.997
And his son, John, is actually
the one who had to dress him.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.098
-[exclaims]Oh!
-Okay.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.733
-And John is still living.
-Yes.

16:41.735 --> 16:42.767
-Okay.
-Yes.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.902
[Adam] So they were a very
traditional family.

16:44.904 --> 16:48.940
Right, even with our current
John, they were still like,

16:48.942 --> 16:50.174
dressing for dinner.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.044
Oh yeah. That's important
in our investigation.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.778
-They're very traditional.
-Yes.

16:54.780 --> 16:59.317
I think it's stuck with that.
That was all this house saw
when people lived here.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.787
[Amy] What we're looking for
is that, kind of, classic
unfinished business

17:02.789 --> 17:06.024
is what keeps a lot of
spirits behind,

17:06.026 --> 17:09.994
so if there's anything that
you think could lead to that.

17:09.996 --> 17:13.364
Us at Liberty Hall just think
that they are

17:13.366 --> 17:14.899
hanging out at their
family home.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.300
[Amy] Right.

17:16.302 --> 17:19.103
[Rachael] But, I forgot to
warn them that you
were coming.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.638
[Amy] Okay.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.807
-Which is probably a
good thing.
-Yeah.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.476
-Rachael, usually warns them.
-Well, it is, but I also...

17:25.478 --> 17:28.646
don't want anything bad
to happen in the house

17:28.648 --> 17:30.048
-Right.
-Yeah.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.418
Honestly, the last time that,
we believe some ghosts were

17:33.420 --> 17:36.454
antagonized a little bit,
maybe more than they
should have been,

17:36.456 --> 17:38.189
and a ceiling came down.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.092
[suspenseful music playing]

17:41.828 --> 17:42.994
[Amy] Okay.

17:42.996 --> 17:45.029
-And so, we don't know--
-Coincidence, we don't know.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.965
Coincidence, perhaps. But it
was the room
of the antagonist.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.034
[Adam] Oh, and that's the...
which room--

17:50.036 --> 17:52.236
The old toy room that is
now the sports equipment.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.705
-Okay. That makes sense.
-Okay.

17:54.707 --> 17:58.042
[Amy] Thank you so much
for teaching us so much
about the house.

17:58.044 --> 18:00.711
<i> [Amy] We have the</i>
<i>  curator here and the</i>
<i>  caretaker here telling us</i>

18:00.713 --> 18:03.915
<i>  things are getting more</i>
<i>  extreme and so I think now</i>

18:03.917 --> 18:06.384
<i>  we're just gonna call</i>
<i>  John's team in tonight.</i>

18:06.386 --> 18:07.752
-Hey, how are you?
-Hey, welcome back.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.287
Good. Welcome back in.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.989
<i> [Amy] He's better</i>
<i>  acquainted with the house</i>
<i>  and the spirits here.</i>

18:11.991 --> 18:14.959
<i>  We're hoping he can</i>
<i>  facilitate some sort of</i>
<i>  breakthrough.</i>

18:14.961 --> 18:17.495
<i>  We're giving him our recorder</i>
<i>  to see if he gets any useful</i>

18:17.497 --> 18:20.631
<i>  EVPs that might help later</i>
<i>  in our investigation.</i>

18:22.001 --> 18:24.368
[eerie music playing]

18:24.370 --> 18:26.571
<i> [John] We'll start with a</i>
<i>  REM Pod on the bed.</i>

18:27.307 --> 18:29.807
[Tania on radio]
<i>  Yeah, I guess so.</i>

18:29.809 --> 18:33.444
We're gonna start with a
REM Pod. A REM Pod actually

18:33.446 --> 18:38.015
um, emits electromagnetic
field around the antenna.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.917
<i> [Adam] The camera went out.</i>

18:39.919 --> 18:41.285
-Oh [bleep]
-And now it's back.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.387
<i> [Tania] I'm gonna put</i>
<i>  this one out in the hallway.</i>

18:45.091 --> 18:50.995
[John] Then I'm gonna use
static detectors, so if
anything passes by

18:50.997 --> 18:53.097
either one of these, it's
gonna turn green and red.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.199
-What the [bleep]
-This went out.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.002
-What went out?
-This whole...this whole
camera went out again.

18:58.004 --> 19:01.172
[Amy] The camera's
going haywire.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.974
[John] That's something
on the bed, already.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.576
[John] Mary Alice,
is this you?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.813
Do you want me to take
that off the bed?

19:08.815 --> 19:11.849
If...if that doesn't belong on
the bed, you can make that

19:11.851 --> 19:15.653
light up and make music
again and I'll put it
somewhere else.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.155
[music starts playing] Okay.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.490
I'll take it off the bed then.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.792
<i> -[John] It doesn't</i>
<i>  belong there.</i>
<i> -Yeah, it's going off.</i>

19:21.794 --> 19:24.662
If you want me to take it
out of here and not use it

19:24.664 --> 19:27.498
make that make some
music again, light up
different colors.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.500
[Adam] Out of range again.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.837
<i> [John] Again, I don't mean to</i>
<i>  disrespect you by putting</i>

19:32.839 --> 19:36.040
anything on your bed, we know
that, when we were here

19:36.042 --> 19:39.010
there was a person or two
who wasn't really happy...

19:39.012 --> 19:41.979
Mary Alice, if this is you,
touch something on the bed

19:41.981 --> 19:44.348
or touch the...the circle
on the dresser.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.351
So, you're gonna use yes
to answer yes, green

19:47.353 --> 19:49.854
or pink for no.
Is it just you,

19:49.856 --> 19:52.423
or is John still here?

19:52.425 --> 19:54.659
That's what we really wanna
know when we come here.

19:54.661 --> 19:58.296
Find out who's here,
who kinda doesn't
like us being here.

19:59.132 --> 20:00.398
You can help us with all that.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.670
[eerie music playing]

20:05.672 --> 20:07.405
[Tania] All right, Mary Alice.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.408
I guess we should set up
where they could be there,
somewhere.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.443
So now they're moving
into this room.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.480
-We're gonna focus on the bed.
-Bed, yeah.

20:16.482 --> 20:20.484
If the camera starts
going out in the other
room, that's gonna be it.

20:20.486 --> 20:21.852
<i> [Tania] Remember these?</i>

20:21.854 --> 20:23.688
<i>  You used these before.</i>

20:25.124 --> 20:26.457
-Out of range.
-There it goes.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.526
Every time they walk in a
room, the camera goes out.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.095
<i> [John] Yes.</i>

20:31.097 --> 20:33.497
Yes, we...okay that's good.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.367
[John] Do you wanna try
and do an EVP session?

20:36.369 --> 20:37.768
[Tania] You wanna do that?

20:37.770 --> 20:39.537
[John] To see if we can get
a name or an answer.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.174
Do you come in and out
of that mirror?

20:43.176 --> 20:45.009
<i>  Is that possible for you</i>
<i>  to do?</i>

20:47.146 --> 20:49.313
[whispers] John.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.117
What you hearing
out there? You're hearing
voices out there?

20:53.119 --> 20:54.752
[Tania] Yes!

20:54.754 --> 20:56.687
It's a woman saying, John.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.990
-From the hallway?
-From the hallway.

20:58.992 --> 21:01.192
<i> [Amy] Does she remember them,</i>
<i>  or is she calling for John?</i>

21:01.194 --> 21:02.360
I think she's calling
for John.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.961
[Amy] I think she's calling
for John too.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.696
She's like, please
do something.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.897
[continues indistinctly]

21:06.899 --> 21:08.266
There's nobody
out here, right?

21:08.268 --> 21:10.601
-There's nobody up here.
-There's nobody, but us.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.672
Because I'm hearing like,
a lot of talking, shuffling
and movement.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.841
-Let's see if she hears us.
<i> -[Tania] Is something</i>
<i>  in there?</i>

21:16.843 --> 21:18.442
She's not hearing us.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.344
[Tania] There's nobody
up here, right? Just us?

21:22.215 --> 21:24.282
[suspenseful music playing]

21:25.151 --> 21:27.118
Who was the woman in
the other room,

21:27.120 --> 21:29.420
that said the name
John, twice?

21:32.325 --> 21:36.360
How many members of
your family are still
walking around the mansion?

21:38.331 --> 21:40.398
[John] Who was the person
we hear in the hallway?

21:44.070 --> 21:46.270
Okay, we're gonna go
away for now.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.340
All right, I think we're done.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.409
[eerie music playing]

21:53.146 --> 21:54.412
-Thank you.
-How was that for you?

21:54.414 --> 21:56.781
-It was good.
-How did it feel up there?

21:56.783 --> 21:58.482
We think that they kinda
respond to us.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.917
I mean, we've been here
many times.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.452
[Amy] Yeah.

22:01.454 --> 22:04.488
[John] I hope there's some
answers because, man,
it's so hard to tell.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.223
[Amy] Well thank you
so much you guys.

22:06.225 --> 22:07.591
Thank you.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.296
[Amy] Okay, so let's go ahead
and listen to this.

22:12.298 --> 22:14.231
And hopefully they got
something on it.

22:14.233 --> 22:18.202
[John on tape]
<i>  Try to find out more</i>
<i>  about what's going on.</i>

22:18.204 --> 22:24.075
<i>  I asked about the mirror.</i>
<i>  Do you come in and out</i>
<i>  of that mirror?</i>

22:25.878 --> 22:27.111
[both exclaiming]
That is not me.

22:27.447 --> 22:30.014
[eerie music playing]

22:30.917 --> 22:32.483
[Amy] That is not me,
that's very clear.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.187
<i> [John on tape] Who was the</i>
<i>  woman in the other room,</i>

22:36.189 --> 22:38.322
<i>  that said the name</i>
<i>  John, twice?</i>

22:39.992 --> 22:42.193
[distortion]

22:42.195 --> 22:45.229
-Oh! [giggles]
-What is going on?

22:45.231 --> 22:47.398
<i> [John on tape] Who was the</i>
<i>  woman in the other room,</i>

22:47.400 --> 22:49.333
<i>  that said the name</i>
<i>  John, twice?</i>

22:51.003 --> 22:54.138
[distortion]

22:55.141 --> 22:57.041
<i> [John on tape] How many</i>
<i>  members of your family are</i>

22:57.043 --> 22:59.110
<i>  still walking around</i>
<i>  the mansion?</i>

23:00.847 --> 23:03.080
<i>  Who was the person we hear</i>
<i>  in the hallway?</i>

23:06.185 --> 23:09.320
[Adam] I think the
biggest take away is
they've gotten activity.

23:09.322 --> 23:13.023
Our cameras keep going out
when they sit down and do
an EVP session

23:13.025 --> 23:15.326
in there, just having
a conversation.

23:15.328 --> 23:17.795
It seems to a be a bit more
calm in the room.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.631
[Amy] The most responses
they've gotten are EVPs.

23:20.633 --> 23:24.735
Captain John and his family,
they enjoy having
a conversation.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.938
<i> [Adam] Our plan worked,</i>
<i>  John's crew got</i>
<i>  a lot of activity.</i>

23:27.940 --> 23:29.974
<i>  And hiding behind the</i>
<i>  curtains, so to speak</i>

23:29.976 --> 23:32.943
<i>  provided Amy and I</i>
<i>  with valuable insight.</i>

23:32.945 --> 23:35.846
<i>  The spirits here seem</i>
<i>  especially dignified and</i>

23:35.848 --> 23:38.616
<i>  prefer conversation with</i>
<i>  guests they know.</i>

23:38.618 --> 23:40.418
[eerie music playing]

23:43.990 --> 23:47.224
<i> [Amy] One of the best ways we</i>
<i>  can better acquaint ourselves</i>

23:47.226 --> 23:51.162
<i>  is by meeting with the last</i>
<i>  living descendant of</i>
<i>  Liberty Hall, in person.</i>

23:51.364 --> 23:53.831
<i>  Captain John's son.</i>

23:53.833 --> 23:57.034
Thank you for taking the
time to sit with us.

23:57.036 --> 24:02.072
We're just trying to kinda
figure out what life was like
growing up here.

24:02.074 --> 24:06.210
Uh, as children, we lived in
one wing of the house

24:06.212 --> 24:09.079
and my parents lived in
another wing.

24:09.081 --> 24:12.316
We did have a nursemaid
looking after us but, uh,

24:12.318 --> 24:14.251
that wasn't quiet the same
as mom and dad.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.986
-Right.
-Right, okay.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.889
[Adam] How would your
family entertain?

24:18.891 --> 24:23.994
The entertainment was
pretty much very quiet, very

24:23.996 --> 24:29.033
genteel, if you will. They
would have some cocktails,
they would have a nice dinner

24:29.035 --> 24:32.002
then they would sit around
and just talk.

24:32.004 --> 24:36.941
Very, uh, formal I would say,
they would be very
respectful obviously...

24:36.943 --> 24:38.843
Yes, people would
dress for dinner.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.010
Mm-hm.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.880
Do you think the house
is haunted?

24:42.882 --> 24:46.884
I know that they, uh, that
there are ghosts around here.

24:46.886 --> 24:50.187
The ghosts that are here are
just people wandering around

24:50.189 --> 24:52.690
because they, uh, want to
see who's here.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.892
Mm-hm.

24:54.894 --> 24:59.430
If we were to, come in contact
with your father, Captain...

24:59.432 --> 25:00.297
Yes.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.766
What would you think of that?

25:02.768 --> 25:06.237
I would think it would be
great and wonderful because

25:06.239 --> 25:10.140
uh, even though,
he might not know you

25:10.142 --> 25:14.078
he was a very friendly guy,
very much of a
personable person.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.882
One of the, my big
regrets is that

25:17.884 --> 25:21.952
I really never had the chance
to know him as an adult.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.287
Mm-hm.

25:24.323 --> 25:28.392
If you wanted to, you could
write those questions
down for us.

25:28.394 --> 25:31.161
-[Amy] If you'd like,
we can try, for sure.
-I like that idea.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.930
-Yeah.
-Okay.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.565
-Well, thank you so much.
-Thank you.

25:34.567 --> 25:35.966
-You've been great.
-Appreciate it.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.501
-No problem.
-Wonderful, yes.

25:37.503 --> 25:41.105
<i> [Adam] Captain John</i>
<i>  seemed like a nice guy,</i>
<i>  formal, hospitable</i>

25:41.107 --> 25:44.542
<i>  and really appreciated</i>
<i>  good conversations.</i>

25:44.544 --> 25:49.313
<i>  So why in death</i>
<i>  has he become so</i>
<i> uncharacteristically menacing?</i>

25:49.315 --> 25:53.083
<i>  Why is he getting physical</i>
<i>  with investigators</i>
<i>  and frightening the staff?</i>

25:53.085 --> 25:56.053
<i>  These are the questions</i>
<i>  worrying everyone.</i>

25:56.055 --> 25:59.857
<i>  And we're about to step</i>
<i>  far outside the box to get</i>
<i>  the answers.</i>

25:59.859 --> 26:01.358
<i>  That's where our friend,</i>
<i>  Greg comes in.</i>

26:01.360 --> 26:03.494
[suspenseful music playing]

26:07.166 --> 26:09.867
We've invited Greg Newkirk
to join us on the case.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.334
[Greg] Hey guys.

26:11.437 --> 26:15.339
<i> [Amy] Greg brought</i>
<i>  an idea to us that was</i>
<i>  very unconventional</i>

26:15.341 --> 26:17.708
<i>  and I'm sure people</i>
<i>  watching it will think,</i>

26:17.710 --> 26:19.810
<i>  "What the heck</i>
<i>  are they doing?"</i>

26:19.812 --> 26:23.447
<i>  But we need to figure out</i>
<i>  why Captain John has been</i>
<i>  overly aggressive,</i>

26:23.449 --> 26:25.783
<i>  and so Adam and I are gonna</i>
<i>  have to get very creative</i>

26:25.785 --> 26:27.818
<i>  with ways that we can try to</i>
<i>  narrow this down.</i>

26:27.820 --> 26:30.688
<i>  And that's why Greg is here,</i>
<i>  to help us get closer to him.</i>

26:32.058 --> 26:35.159
You mentioned, that you might
be having a bit of an issue

26:35.161 --> 26:38.128
-relating to whoever's here.
-Mm-hm.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.097
There is something we could
do to help that.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.699
-Oh.
-Um.

26:41.701 --> 26:45.936
I have a few tools with me

26:45.938 --> 26:50.641
that will allow us to
make you a little bit closer
to the other side,

26:50.643 --> 26:52.409
crossing over.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.577
[Amy] We become ghosts.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.480
No!

26:56.482 --> 26:59.984
There's a very small ritual
that involves the ingestion

26:59.986 --> 27:02.319
of a very special type
of honey.

27:02.321 --> 27:08.025
The honey was harvested
by bees in a gigantic
cemetery in England.

27:08.027 --> 27:11.095
And so you are in a way
communing with the dead.

27:11.097 --> 27:14.999
And then you just spend a few
minutes meditating on death

27:15.001 --> 27:17.167
and what it's like
to be a ghost.

27:17.169 --> 27:21.372
And while that honey is
in you, you will be a
little bit closer.

27:24.343 --> 27:28.912
This is a psychopomp.
This is Hermanubis,
Guardian of the dead

27:28.914 --> 27:31.915
and you would just hold that,
meditate on death

27:31.917 --> 27:35.219
for a few minutes and then
when you feel like you

27:35.221 --> 27:37.454
-have made a connection,
-Mm-hm.

27:37.456 --> 27:41.191
pull the shroud off and
just see what happens.

27:41.193 --> 27:43.127
Yeah, I'm okay with it.

27:43.129 --> 27:47.731
You doing something like this
experiment is a way of showing

27:47.733 --> 27:51.001
"Listen, I want to be on your
level, I wanna understand".

27:51.003 --> 27:54.938
This will help you be with
them, at least temporarily.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.073
[Adam] Okay.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.542
I mean, no time
like the present.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.648
[eerie music playing]

28:10.222 --> 28:11.955
[Adam] So, how do we begin?

28:11.957 --> 28:15.993
[Greg] All right, before you
lay down, you need to ingest
some of this.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.429
This is a very special honey.

28:18.431 --> 28:20.264
[Greg] The idea behind this is

28:20.266 --> 28:22.332
while this is in your system,

28:22.334 --> 28:25.302
you will experience
the effects of the meditation

28:25.304 --> 28:26.937
-that's you're supposed
to do now.
-Okay.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.138
[Greg] Let's lay you down.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.111
[Greg] Coins to pay the ferry.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.251
[Greg] And, now,
we're gonna cover you up
with a burial shroud.

28:41.253 --> 28:46.190
<i>  And while you're laying</i>
<i>  in here, by yourself,</i>
<i>  meditate on the idea of death</i>

28:46.192 --> 28:49.993
<i>  and the particular</i>
<i>  frustrations that you felt</i>

28:49.995 --> 28:51.895
<i>  trying to communicate</i>
<i>  with the other side.</i>

28:51.897 --> 28:54.431
<i>  When you feel</i>
<i> like you've made a connection,</i>

28:54.433 --> 28:56.667
<i>  you can pull the shroud off,</i>

28:56.669 --> 29:01.004
<i>  and that is</i>
<i>  your symbolic rebirth</i>
<i>  into the spirit world.</i>

29:01.640 --> 29:03.474
Rest in peace, Adam.

29:03.476 --> 29:05.676
<i> [Amy] Very weird to cover</i>
<i>  your best friend with sheet.</i>

29:05.678 --> 29:07.678
<i>  Oh, my God, it feels like...</i>

29:08.981 --> 29:10.214
Oh, my goodness, guys.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.683
-And you watch that,
you know, notice anything.
-Yeah.

29:12.685 --> 29:15.052
Take a note
and then, I'm gonna listen.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.324
His breathing's getting fast.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.525
[Amy] Hm-hm.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.260
[controlled breathing]

29:23.262 --> 29:25.596
He needs to control
that breathing
a little bit.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.399
[Amy] Another camera
just went out.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.373
[Amy] It's back.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.210
He looks like
he's really in it, too.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.278
[Amy whispers] It looks crazy.

29:41.747 --> 29:43.647
Looks so disturbing.

29:48.821 --> 29:52.956
And that's, literally,
like watching someone
come back from the dead.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.192
He's like [bleep] Zombie.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.963
Look at him.
He, literally, looks a vampire

29:59.965 --> 30:01.565
coming back
from the dead right now.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.936
Oh, my God.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.507
[whispering]
Let's go in there.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.681
-[Greg] You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.018
[Adam] It's like-- it's like--

30:21.821 --> 30:23.086
Uh...

30:23.956 --> 30:25.989
Uh, I don't know
how to describe it.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.291
I don't know
how to describe it.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.259
It, literally, looked like
you're coming back
from the dead

30:29.261 --> 30:30.494
when you came out of it.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.263
What it reminded me of...

30:33.265 --> 30:35.966
At first,
I kept thinking about...

30:35.968 --> 30:39.469
what we ask and what we do
when we're communicating
with them.

30:39.471 --> 30:43.006
[Adam] Thinks like
I don't wanna be forgotten.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.174
Uh, it's hard to communicate--

30:44.176 --> 30:46.076
I can't hear you,
I can't see you,
I can't feel you.

30:46.078 --> 30:51.381
And, then, I felt so heavy
and I couldn't move
and I felt trapped.

30:51.383 --> 30:55.118
And, then, at one point,
all I wanted anyone to do
is acknowledge me.

30:56.021 --> 30:59.122
-[Greg] You were dead.
-[bleep]

30:59.124 --> 31:02.025
It's so weird because
all of those feelings
that you're describing,

31:02.027 --> 31:05.062
are kind of exactly
what we've speculated.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.529
You died two deaths,

31:06.699 --> 31:09.766
your actual death
and the last time
someone says your name.

31:09.768 --> 31:12.069
[Amy] I think, it is really
that acknowledgment.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.837
-You're looking
through the mirror.
-[Amy] Yeah.

31:13.839 --> 31:16.406
You're literally looking
through the mirror.
[chuckles] It's so...

31:17.877 --> 31:20.844
<i> [Adam] This macabre experiment</i>
<i>  is the most extreme thing</i>

31:20.846 --> 31:24.948
<i>  we've ever done</i>
<i>  to get on the same level</i>
<i>  as another spirit.</i>

31:24.950 --> 31:28.352
<i>  Greg said the effects</i>
<i>  of crossing over</i>
<i>  don't last very long,</i>

31:28.354 --> 31:32.422
<i>  so, we're headed upstairs now</i>
<i>  to address Captain John</i>
<i>  one last time.</i>

31:37.296 --> 31:40.030
-[Adam] Oh, wow.
-[Amy] Yeah, right?

31:40.032 --> 31:43.800
One of the gentleman
who lived here
was Captain John Kean

31:43.802 --> 31:47.871
and one of the housekeepers
claims that she saw this man,

31:47.873 --> 31:49.573
actually come out
of the mirror.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.477
So, is this mirror
actually something

31:53.479 --> 31:56.313
that is at play
in this investigation.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.248
I have an SLS camera going

31:58.250 --> 32:01.919
'cause I know
they've caught things
on the SLS cameras before.

32:01.921 --> 32:05.088
I have this over here,
so, if anybody recognizes
the mirror

32:05.090 --> 32:08.025
or if the mirror
has a thing, maybe
it will go off.

32:08.027 --> 32:11.295
[Amy] Let's go ahead
and start asking questions
since that one's going.

32:13.232 --> 32:17.334
So, Captain John, are you here
and willing to speak with us?

32:22.041 --> 32:25.108
Captain, we heard
that after you passed away,

32:25.110 --> 32:27.244
they brought your body
here, into this room,

32:27.980 --> 32:31.982
and your son dressed you,
is that true?

32:33.619 --> 32:37.688
It seems to us
that this is a very
traditional household,

32:37.690 --> 32:42.092
and that disorder
is not something you enjoy.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.394
So, is there anything
happening here

32:44.396 --> 32:46.964
that you would consider
disorder?

32:49.368 --> 32:52.402
Do you think the way
that we are addressing you

32:52.404 --> 32:55.038
is too informal
for your liking?

32:59.244 --> 33:01.378
Where did this mirror
come from?

33:06.185 --> 33:07.884
[Amy] I'll play this
for you again.

33:07.886 --> 33:12.089
[Amy on recorder]
<i> So, Captain John, are you here</i>
<i>  and willing to speak with us?</i>

33:12.091 --> 33:14.524
-[loud static]
-[Adam on recorder]
<i>  Captain, we heard that...</i>

33:14.526 --> 33:16.593
[Adam] Did that say,
"Yes, I'm here."

33:16.595 --> 33:18.562
-I thought I heard
"I'm right here."
-[Adam] Yeah.

33:18.564 --> 33:21.264
<i> [Amy on recorder] Are you here</i>
<i>  and willing to speak with us?</i>

33:21.266 --> 33:24.101
-[loud static]
-"I'm right here."

33:24.103 --> 33:25.769
[Adam on recorder]
<i>  After you passed away,</i>

33:25.771 --> 33:28.038
<i>  they brought your body</i>
<i>  here to this room...</i>

33:28.040 --> 33:31.842

<i>  was that true?</i>

33:31.844 --> 33:32.776
[loud static]

33:32.778 --> 33:34.411
-"That's true."
-"That's true."

33:36.115 --> 33:39.883
<i> [Amy on record] It seems to us</i>
<i>  that this is a very</i>
<i>  traditional household,</i>

33:39.885 --> 33:44.287
<i>  and that disorder</i>
<i>  is not something you enjoy.</i>

33:44.289 --> 33:46.923
<i>  So, is there anything</i>
<i>  happening here</i>

33:46.925 --> 33:49.192
<i>  that you would consider</i>
<i>  disorder?</i>

33:49.194 --> 33:52.095
[very loud static] Oh.

33:52.097 --> 33:55.399
[Amy] What is happening here,
you guys? It's like...

33:55.401 --> 33:58.068
Yelling, unhappy.

33:58.070 --> 34:01.271
I've have never heard
anything like this
before in my life.

34:03.876 --> 34:06.810
It sounds like
he's speaking it,
and, then...

34:06.812 --> 34:08.845
Whatever the energy
that it takes--

34:08.847 --> 34:12.082
-It's coming-- it's like a--
it's continuing.
-Right.

34:12.084 --> 34:14.117
[Adam] It just goes "woof"
like rushes through it.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.319
This is just so bizarre
okay, hang on.

34:17.256 --> 34:18.055
[whispers] Okay.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.257
[static]

34:20.259 --> 34:23.860
[Adam on recorder]
<i>  Do you think the way</i>
<i>  that we are addressing you</i>

34:23.862 --> 34:25.829
<i>  is too informal</i>
<i>  for your liking?</i>

34:25.831 --> 34:28.231
[loud static]

34:28.233 --> 34:31.101
[Greg] It sounds like,
"You're not...ta-ta ta.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.037
[Adam on recorder]
<i>  Is too informal</i>
<i>  for your liking?</i>

34:34.039 --> 34:35.472
[loud static]

34:35.474 --> 34:37.607
-"You're not like us."
-[Amy] "You're not like us."

34:37.876 --> 34:39.910
For sure.

34:39.912 --> 34:42.379
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  Where did this mirror</i>
<i>  come from?</i>

34:43.082 --> 34:46.483
[loud static]

34:46.485 --> 34:50.020
It's, literally,
telling us, like, exactly
where it came from

34:50.022 --> 34:52.155
and it's just hard
to make out.

34:52.157 --> 34:54.224
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  Where did this mirror</i>
<i>  come from?</i>

34:54.960 --> 34:57.160
[loud static]

34:57.162 --> 35:00.130
[Amy]
"The mirror came from Mary."

35:00.933 --> 35:02.399
[Adam]
What is his wife's name?

35:04.670 --> 35:07.204
So, it was Mary.
It came from Mary.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.807
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  Everything we're doing,</i>
<i>  like I said, before,</i>

35:10.809 --> 35:13.076
<i> comes from a place of respect.</i>

35:13.078 --> 35:17.080
<i>  So, we apologize</i>
<i>  if those who came before...</i>

35:17.082 --> 35:21.451
<i>  were disrespectful to you</i>
<i>  and I don't think that was</i>
<i>  their intention at all.</i>

35:23.021 --> 35:25.021
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.357
-[Amy] Silence.
-Yo.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.192
-If it was something--
-[Amy] Silence...

35:29.194 --> 35:31.328
Like, natural
in the environment,
it would keep going.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.263
I've got goosebumps on my arm.

35:33.265 --> 35:35.999
That was one
of the most insane--

35:36.001 --> 35:37.901
-[Adam] I've never heard one.
-EVP sessions.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.370
I've never heard anything
like that. Never.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.908
Um, Captain John
or whoever we're speaking to,

35:44.910 --> 35:46.276
we feel like
you might be someone

35:46.278 --> 35:49.079
who is more
of a conversationalist.

35:49.081 --> 35:51.815
We met with you son, today.

35:51.817 --> 35:56.920
We asked him if, you know,
he had any questions
for you.

35:56.922 --> 36:01.424
And he said it would thrilling
to be able to ask you
some of those questions.

36:01.426 --> 36:04.361
So, Amy and I are gonna read
these questions to you.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.663
[Amy] I'll read the first one.

36:06.665 --> 36:10.133
He wants to know
because he said
he never knew this...

36:10.135 --> 36:13.570
was, "How did you and
mom meet?"

36:16.041 --> 36:18.041
[Adam] His second question is

36:18.510 --> 36:22.579
"When, as a young lawyer,

36:23.282 --> 36:27.450
"did you leave Standard Oil?

36:27.452 --> 36:32.189
"Did the family
ask you to work
for their companies?"

36:36.695 --> 36:37.894
Thank you, sir,
for talking to us.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.163
If you did,
we're gonna play this back.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.065
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  I'll read the first one.</i>

36:42.067 --> 36:45.135
<i>  He wants to know</i>
<i>  because he said</i>
<i>  he never knew this...</i>

36:45.137 --> 36:48.271
<i>  is how did you and mom meet.</i>

36:48.273 --> 36:50.106
[static]

36:50.442 --> 36:52.008
He says something.

36:52.010 --> 36:54.477
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  You and mom meet.</i>

36:55.547 --> 36:57.380
[static]

36:57.382 --> 37:00.684
It's-- I heard--
It almost sounds like
it says met at church.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.452
[Adam on recorder]
<i>  His second question is...</i>

37:02.454 --> 37:06.156
<i>  "When, as a young lawyer,</i>

37:06.158 --> 37:09.192
<i>  "did you leave Standard Oil?</i>

37:09.194 --> 37:10.894
<i>  "I want to know,</i>

37:10.896 --> 37:14.998
<i>  "did the family</i>
<i>  ask you to work</i>
<i>  for their companies?"</i>

37:15.000 --> 37:16.333
[loud static]

37:17.169 --> 37:18.501
"They did?"

37:22.140 --> 37:25.842
<i>  "Did the family</i>
<i>  ask you to work</i>
<i>  for their companies?"</i>

37:25.844 --> 37:27.010
[static]

37:27.012 --> 37:28.578
-They did.
-Hm-hm.

37:30.082 --> 37:33.149
[Amy] Okay, [sighs] well,
we did hear your answers.

37:33.151 --> 37:36.086
And we're happy
that you're talking with us,
so, thank you.

37:37.122 --> 37:39.155
-[Adam] That was wild.
-[Amy] That was the craziest--

37:39.157 --> 37:41.191
[Adam] That was
a really good one.

37:45.631 --> 37:49.332
[Amy] It's been really great
having so many people involved
in this investigation.

37:49.334 --> 37:53.803
I think that, you know,
having you two,
and then having your team,

37:53.805 --> 37:55.705
it's just been very helpful.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.643
We did have some experiences
right off the bat.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.778
Uh, the first night
we came in--

38:01.780 --> 38:03.847
-We started in this room.
-[Adam] The morning room.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.349
And we heard
what sounded like a bell.

38:06.351 --> 38:07.651
[bell dinging]

38:10.222 --> 38:12.289
People have said
that they've heard
it before.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.124
We all heard it.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.692
[Adam] And, then,
it happened again.

38:15.694 --> 38:17.994
-And, it became
more deliberate like--
-[Amy] It wouldn't stop.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.796
Did it sound nearby or...

38:19.798 --> 38:24.100
It sounded like it was coming
from this general area.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.202
'Cause there's a bell
in the dining room.

38:26.204 --> 38:28.104
Would you like me to
ring that, see if that's it.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.439
-Yes, can you?
-[Maryellen] Sure.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.041
[Adam] Oh, my gosh.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.279
[bell dinging]

38:36.281 --> 38:39.215
-[Adam] Yeah.
-That is so crazy.

38:39.217 --> 38:41.384
-Look at the goosebumps on me.
-All right, yeah. [chuckles]

38:41.386 --> 38:44.754
It's just that we couldn't
figure out what it was.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.924
And it was definitely
trying to get our attention
like it just kept going.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.493
[Amy] We were getting
activity, obviously,

38:50.495 --> 38:54.264
but we needed
identifiable activity.

38:54.266 --> 38:57.667
We went up the red room
and we had a conversation
with Captain John.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.769
[Adam] He had a lot to say.

38:59.771 --> 39:03.006
Uh, and it was very startling
at first.

39:03.008 --> 39:07.143
[Adam on recorder]
<i>  Is too informal</i>
<i>  for your liking?</i>

39:07.312 --> 39:09.012
[loud static]

39:09.014 --> 39:10.947
[Adam] Did you hear that,
"You're not like us."

39:10.949 --> 39:13.383
-I heard the beginning.
-Yeah.

39:13.385 --> 39:18.121
[Adam on recorder]
<i>  Is too informal</i>
<i>  for your liking?</i>

39:18.123 --> 39:20.090
<i>  -"You're not like us."</i>
<i>  -Oh, yeah.</i>

39:20.892 --> 39:24.127
Yes, so clear.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.062
So, then, the mirror.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.864
[loud static]

39:27.866 --> 39:29.499
[Amy on recorder]
<i>  Where did this mirror</i>
<i>  come from?</i>

39:30.102 --> 39:33.069
[loud static]

39:33.071 --> 39:36.306
"There mirror came
from Mary Alice."
[thuds]

39:36.308 --> 39:38.608
-[John] Are you kidding me?
-[Adam] Yeah, listen.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.111
-Are you kidding me?
-[Adam] Listen.

39:41.113 --> 39:44.347
-[on recorder]
The mirror came from Mary.
-Oh, my God.

39:44.349 --> 39:47.150
It's from their house,
from the Barney household.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.819
Sold at Lexington Avenue,
which would have been
Mary Alice.

39:49.821 --> 39:52.756
Oh, my goodness.

39:52.758 --> 39:55.525
I mean, what does
that feel like for you--
I mean, to hear that.

39:56.962 --> 39:58.261
First of all,
I'm, like, super emotional

39:58.263 --> 40:01.531
in general, I think,
these days, anyway.

40:01.533 --> 40:05.101
[sighs in relief]
Give me a second.
[sniffles]

40:05.370 --> 40:06.936
This is my house.

40:07.372 --> 40:10.006
And this is my responsibility.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.842
And so to get that response
and to, kind of, hear it

40:12.844 --> 40:16.746
really, clearly,
it's just, kind of,
crazy because...

40:16.748 --> 40:19.115
we've been here
for so long,
you know all these stories

40:19.117 --> 40:21.518
and, then, to have it
validated like that...

40:22.187 --> 40:23.453
[sniffles]

40:23.455 --> 40:25.121
-[Adam] You guys...
-We're fine. I'm good.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.589
-[Adam] Are you sure?
Okay.
-Hm-hm.

40:27.659 --> 40:30.627
After that, we wanted to talk
to Captain John more,

40:30.629 --> 40:33.363
but, we wanted talk
with John Kean.

40:33.365 --> 40:37.834
We talked to John Kean,
he brought up
how they really enjoyed

40:37.836 --> 40:40.470
just kicking back
and having a conversation.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.672
We had John Kean
write down questions

40:42.674 --> 40:45.341
he wanted us to ask
of his father.

40:45.343 --> 40:49.045
Oddly, we got response to one.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.547
[Adam on recorder]
<i>  "I want to know...</i>

40:50.549 --> 40:54.918
<i>  "Did the family</i>
<i>  ask you to work</i>
<i>  for their companies?"</i>

40:54.920 --> 40:56.319
[loud static]

40:56.321 --> 40:57.654
[both] "They did."

40:59.991 --> 41:01.858
[Amy] Here's the thing
to think about this, though.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.760
He already told us one thing

41:03.762 --> 41:07.096
that you were able to confirm,
historically, as accurate.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.566
-So, that's-- that's huge.
-[Adam] Yeah.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.768
We definitely think
there are, probably,
other spirits here,

41:11.770 --> 41:14.871
but, they stepped aside,
so the captain could speak.

41:14.873 --> 41:17.373
We'll give you this
for your archives
because it's special.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.676
-[Maryellen] Thank you.
We will.
-[Adam] You should keep it.

41:19.678 --> 41:22.712
This helps me a lot,
like you said, now,

41:22.714 --> 41:25.181
when we come in here,
again, and we do try
different things,

41:25.183 --> 41:27.050
-we'll, kind of, emulate
what you did...
-Thank you.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.285
And try to get
more answers
and more information.

41:29.287 --> 41:32.822
-And I thank you
both for... for coming.
-[Adam] You're welcome.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.925
Having that kind of
round table discussion
at the end of this case

41:35.927 --> 41:37.260
was just, really, wonderful.

41:37.262 --> 41:40.063
It put into perspective
how important Liberty Hall

41:40.065 --> 41:43.032
is to everyone involved here,
it's touching.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.801
<i>  I can't think of a case</i>
<i>  where we had such, kind of,</i>

41:44.803 --> 41:48.204
<i> a direct line of communication</i>
<i>  with the spirit there.</i>

41:48.206 --> 41:51.374
<i>  And, it's so apparent</i>
<i>  why Captain John</i>
<i>  is still up here.</i>

41:51.376 --> 41:53.710
He's very much the protector
of this home

41:53.712 --> 41:56.079
and, I'm very excited
to find out

41:56.081 --> 41:59.215
what Captain John
has to say to everyone here
in the future.
