WEBVTT

00:05.305 --> 00:08.509
Miles, how do you like
my new earrings?

00:08.509 --> 00:10.711
They look exactly like
the titanium sonar receptors

00:10.711 --> 00:12.946
that I just ordered
from Conspiracy Barn.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.515
Are you receiving
any messages on yours?

00:14.781 --> 00:16.950
Just one.
Lose the earrings.

00:17.217 --> 00:18.685
The only sound
I want to hear tonight

00:18.685 --> 00:21.121
is Josh whispering
in my ear.

00:21.121 --> 00:22.656
Isn't this like the sixth night
in a row

00:22.656 --> 00:23.957
you and Josh have gone out?

00:23.957 --> 00:24.958
Seventh.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.059
You know,
things were good before

00:26.059 --> 00:28.662
but lately something
is really starting to click.

00:28.662 --> 00:29.963
It's like we're
at a whole new level.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.265
I envy you, Sabrina.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.599
The best relationship
I ever had

00:32.599 --> 00:34.101
was with a hamster
named Pinky

00:34.101 --> 00:35.836
but she had trouble
with commitment

00:35.836 --> 00:38.739
and then there was that whole
"eating her young" issue.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.307
Miles, it'll work out
for you.

00:40.307 --> 00:41.508
You just have to put
yourself out there.

00:41.508 --> 00:42.609
Be open and trusting

00:42.609 --> 00:45.412
and--you know--
good things will happen.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.347
All men are scum.

00:47.347 --> 00:49.216
I'm never dating again.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.150
It works most of the time.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.451
I thought you liked
this new guy.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.420
He turned out to be a sneaky,
conniving liar

00:53.420 --> 00:55.522
just like every other guy
on the planet.

00:55.522 --> 00:56.557
Any woman with half a brain

00:56.557 --> 00:58.425
should avoid them
like the plague.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.561
What are you
all dressed up for?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.396
Uh, I'm doing laundry.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.397
In that?

01:03.397 --> 01:05.699
Makes me feel good
about myself.

01:10.804 --> 01:17.277
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:17.277 --> 01:23.450
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:23.450 --> 01:26.587
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:26.587 --> 01:33.126
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:33.126 --> 01:36.296
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:36.296 --> 01:41.435
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:46.807 --> 01:48.141
That was great, Sabrina.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.610
Only you could get me to see

01:49.610 --> 01:52.412
an obscure documentary on
North American Eskimos.

01:52.412 --> 01:53.981
What can I say?
I'm into Inuits.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.249
You know, they've
had to overcome
incredible hardships

01:56.249 --> 01:57.150
just to survive.

01:57.150 --> 01:59.553
And yet Nanook
always had a smile on his face.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.889
He didn't have a choice--
it was frozen on.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.257
So, what do you have
planned for us next?

02:04.257 --> 02:06.793
The Machu Picchu
Civic Light Opera?

02:06.793 --> 02:09.563
Well, I'll tell you what
I have planned for us.

02:10.197 --> 02:12.933
Mmm. I love that plan.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.969
And I love you, Sabrina.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.006
Wow, Josh, I...

02:19.006 --> 02:21.274
( <i>high-pitched voice</i> ):
I love you, too.

02:21.274 --> 02:21.675
( <i>normal voice</i> ):
I mean

02:21.675 --> 02:23.343
wh-what I meant
to say was

02:23.343 --> 02:24.711
( <i>deep voice</i> ):
I love you.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.179
Sabrina, why are you
talking like that?

02:26.179 --> 02:28.415
Why....?
That's a very good question.

02:28.415 --> 02:29.716
I-I, uh, I must have

02:29.716 --> 02:32.085
a little frog
in my throat, you know.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.588
And he likes to talk
kind of funny sometimes.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.557
But what's important
is how I feel.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.559
Well, how do you feel?

02:42.829 --> 02:44.364
That clears that up.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.601
Morgan, can I see you
for a moment?

02:47.601 --> 02:48.635
Sure,
Professor Spellman.

02:48.635 --> 02:49.836
What's up?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.838
Not your grades.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.074
You got a 12
on your last exam.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.910
Well, at least I broke
double digits this time.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.846
There is no way that
you're going to pass
molecular biology

02:59.846 --> 03:02.315
if you keep getting
grades like this.

03:02.315 --> 03:03.950
Are you studying at all?

03:03.950 --> 03:06.019
Sure, whenever
I get the chance.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.822
But I have all
these other classes

03:08.822 --> 03:09.956
and I've got this job.

03:09.956 --> 03:12.259
Working for my sister
at her coffeehouse.

03:12.259 --> 03:14.795
God knows
that can't be easy.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.798
So, you're aware
that Hilda can be...

03:17.798 --> 03:19.933
Pushy, annoying, rude?

03:19.933 --> 03:21.368
Please, I live
with the woman.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.737
Then you know what
a cross I have to bear.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.306
I mean, how is a gal
supposed to learn
her cell mitosis

03:26.306 --> 03:29.443
when she's sweeping
muffin crumbs 24-7?

03:29.443 --> 03:32.746
It's just like Hilda
to have no respect
for academics.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.048
She needs to realize
that you're a student first

03:35.048 --> 03:36.316
and an employee second.

03:36.316 --> 03:40.520
Thank you for being
so understanding.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.655
I had nowhere to turn

03:41.655 --> 03:45.659
and I... couldn't
say anything because
she's your sister.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.693
Don't you worry.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.628
I will give you
a makeup test

03:48.628 --> 03:50.063
and I'll have a little talk
with Hilda.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.364
Oh!

03:51.364 --> 03:53.834
I-I promise I'll study
really hard for the makeup test

03:53.834 --> 03:56.036
but please don't say
anything to Hilda.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.270
You know, if she knew
that we spoke

03:57.270 --> 03:59.005
she'd work me
like a pack mule.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.173
It'll be our secret.

04:00.173 --> 04:02.209
Aunt Zelda, I need
to talk to you.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.044
And I've got
coffee grounds to dump

04:04.044 --> 04:05.112
and toilets
to scrub.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.346
Bye, Sabrina.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.615
Morgan scrubbing toilets?

04:08.615 --> 04:09.983
Now my hearing's going, too.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.418
What's up, sweetheart?

04:11.418 --> 04:13.220
More like,
"What's up, doc?"

04:13.220 --> 04:14.788
Last night,
for the first time ever

04:14.788 --> 04:16.389
Josh told me
he loved me.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.058
And when I tried
to tell him I loved him

04:18.058 --> 04:19.259
I sounded
like Tweety Bird!

04:19.259 --> 04:21.027
Ooh, I'm so sorry.

04:21.027 --> 04:21.628
I remember when

04:21.628 --> 04:23.630
that happened to me.

04:23.630 --> 04:26.199
So, you talked like a
hyperactive canary, too?

04:26.199 --> 04:27.434
Speedy Gonzalez.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.202
Sabrina, a witch
can only say

04:29.202 --> 04:31.204
"I love you"
in her own voice

04:31.204 --> 04:34.241
if she's 100% sure
of her feelings.

04:34.241 --> 04:37.944
Oh, I thought I was
totally smitten
with Copernicus.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.046
I thought
I totally loved Josh.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.248
Hey, I just said it.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.449
I love Josh.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.084
Why couldn't I say it like that
last night?

04:44.084 --> 04:45.619
Maybe he caught you
by surprise

04:45.619 --> 04:48.021
and it made you nervous and
caused your throat to close up.

04:48.021 --> 04:48.955
That's it.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.991
The old nerves
and closed throat combo.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.059
Well, now that it's not
a surprise anymore

04:53.059 --> 04:54.694
I guess I don't have a problem.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.797
I love you, I love you,
I love you!

04:56.797 --> 04:59.065
I love you, too,
sweetheart.

04:59.065 --> 05:00.333
And I swear...

05:00.333 --> 05:02.469
( <i>scratchy voice</i> ):
I love Copernicus.

05:03.203 --> 05:04.738
Guess I didn't.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.008
I love you.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.276
I love you.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.443
I love you.

05:10.443 --> 05:11.945
Yeah, but what have you done
for you lately?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.580
Oh, I was just practicing.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.283
Tonight's the night
I'm finally going to say
"I love you" to Josh.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.517
Do you want
to practice on me?

05:17.517 --> 05:18.752
For once I'd like to hear
those words uttered

05:18.752 --> 05:20.086
by someone other than my mother

05:20.086 --> 05:23.723
who always tacks on,
"And wear a sweater."

05:23.723 --> 05:25.926
Wow, where are you going?

05:25.926 --> 05:27.027
Please don't hold it
against me

05:27.027 --> 05:30.664
but I have a date.
With a man.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.233
And she's going
to tell him
that she loves him.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.168
I'm not angry.
I'm happy for you.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.670
And I've come to a realization.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.838
The fact that I don't
have a boyfriend

05:37.838 --> 05:39.639
might actually have
something to do with me.

05:39.639 --> 05:40.941
You think?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.610
I just signed up for a
relationship workshop on campus.

05:43.610 --> 05:44.311
Maybe I can figure out

05:44.311 --> 05:45.912
what I'm doing
that's alienating men.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.215
That's great! You know,
I've always wanted to suggest

05:48.215 --> 05:49.950
something like that for you.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.385
But then I realized you're
perfect the way you are.

05:52.385 --> 05:53.920
You know, and this workshop
is just gravy.

05:53.920 --> 05:54.821
Got to go.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.495
So, how did you like
the elk piccata special?

06:02.495 --> 06:05.432
(laughs)It was unusual,but
amazing.

06:05.432 --> 06:06.867
Just like the rest
of the evening.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.934
You know, when I made
that comment

06:07.934 --> 06:10.303
about the Machu Picchu
Civic Light Opera

06:10.303 --> 06:11.838
I didn't actually know
there was one.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.006
But how good were they?

06:13.006 --> 06:15.809
I mean, nobody does <i>Fiddler</i>
like the Peruvians.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.944
Sabrina, you and I
can never break up.

06:17.944 --> 06:18.945
I mean, I could never
go back

06:18.945 --> 06:21.615
to just cheeseburger
and an Adam Sandler movie.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.717
I don't think you're going
to have to, Josh.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.818
There's something
I want to tell you.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.386
Something I tried to say
the other night

06:26.386 --> 06:28.321
but I wasn't able to...

06:28.321 --> 06:30.190
Flowers for the beautiful lady?

06:30.190 --> 06:31.858
Not now; I'm trying
to tell him something.

06:31.858 --> 06:34.628
Well, what better way to say it
than with a rose?

06:34.628 --> 06:36.630
You want her
to buy me the flower?

06:36.630 --> 06:37.998
What's your problem, mate?

06:37.998 --> 06:39.833
Testosterone issues?

06:39.833 --> 06:40.567
Afraid if she buys

06:40.567 --> 06:41.868
the flower,
makes you less of a man?

06:41.868 --> 06:44.204
Here's five bucks.
Take a hike.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.239
Thanks, beautiful lady.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.709
<i>Ciao,</i> sexist pig.

06:49.709 --> 06:50.677
Okay, where were we?

06:50.677 --> 06:52.279
You were going
to tell me something?

06:52.279 --> 06:54.381
Well, the other night
when I tried to say this

06:54.381 --> 06:56.416
it didn't come out right.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.320
But tonight,
I speak from my heart.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.389
( <i>like Jerry Lewis</i> ):
I love you.
I honestly love you.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.924
Sabrina, that's not funny.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.358
I didn't mean that.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.760
So, you don't love me?

07:06.760 --> 07:07.761
No, I do, really.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.129
It just came out wrong.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.264
Let me try one more time.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.366
( <i>as cartoon character</i> ):
I l-l-l-l-love you.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.968
This is ridiculous.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.670
I open up and tell you
my real feelings

07:16.670 --> 07:18.238
and all you do
is make fun of me.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.973
Josh...
Well have some fun with
this.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.442
I've said I love you
for the last time.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.978
Hey, check, please.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.447
Sorry, love.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.582
No refunds.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.989
Well, got to run.
Toodles.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.358
Morgan, there's three hours
left on your shift.

07:38.358 --> 07:41.394
And believe me, I feel terrible
about leaving you like this.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.963
It's just that...

07:42.963 --> 07:44.998
lately Zelda's been giving me
so much homework

07:44.998 --> 07:47.667
I'm only getting 15 minutes
of sleep a night.

07:47.667 --> 07:48.735
That's just like her

07:48.735 --> 07:50.570
not to give a hoot
about the working stiffs

07:50.570 --> 07:53.139
who survive by the sweat
of their brow.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.976
Like biology has anything
to do with life.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.178
<i>(sighs)</i> Don't
you worry.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.046
I'll give
my snooty sister
what for.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.282
Oh, please don't.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.184
It'll only make
the situation worse.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.319
She'll punish me
for being weak.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.254
She does that to me
all the time.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.290
Skinny little sadist.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.192
I just have to catch up
on my rest

08:12.192 --> 08:14.294
and find a way to get
through this semester.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.095
I understand.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.896
You take all the time
you need.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.666
By the way,
how long is a semester?

08:19.666 --> 08:20.734
Two years.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.504
Your aunt
is a saint.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.805
Actually,
they both are.

08:25.805 --> 08:26.806
See ya.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.242
Saint Hilda?

08:29.242 --> 08:31.578
Oh, I just had
the worst evening of my life.

08:31.578 --> 08:32.679
I tried to be romantic

08:32.679 --> 08:34.914
and I ended up sounding
like barnyard animals.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.449
Let me hear
your rooster.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.651
Obviously, this is more
than just a case of nerves.

08:38.651 --> 08:40.020
I mean,
my whole relationship

08:40.020 --> 08:42.222
is on the verge
of going down the tubes.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.690
Do you know someone
that could help me out
with this?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.558
There is a specialist
in the Other Realm.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.494
Someone who deals in
the language of love.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.828
Saperstein?

08:48.828 --> 08:51.031
No, he's lotions
and potions.

08:51.031 --> 08:51.431
Sabrina,

08:51.431 --> 08:52.432
there's only one doctor

08:52.432 --> 08:54.267
who can solve
your kind of problem:

08:54.267 --> 08:56.202
The Love Doctor.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.841
<i>(soulful,seductive music</i> plays)
Wild guess:
you're the Love Doctor?

09:01.841 --> 09:03.376
That's me.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.277
Well, let me just say

09:04.277 --> 09:05.478
that this is
the coolest doctor's office

09:05.478 --> 09:06.012
I've ever been in.

09:06.012 --> 09:08.481
I mean, videos and velvet chairs
in the waiting room...

09:08.481 --> 09:10.417
Enough of the chitchat,
sweetness.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.585
Tell your problems
to the Love Doctor.

09:12.585 --> 09:15.555
Well, my boyfriend, Josh,
just told me he loves me.

09:15.555 --> 09:20.193

09:20.193 --> 09:21.127

09:23.763 --> 09:25.065

10:49.315 --> 10:51.584
I'm using it for
my relationship
workshop therapy.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.953
It helps me to control
my anger towards men.

10:53.953 --> 10:54.687
How?

10:55.755 --> 10:56.823
That's how.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.391
Man, that felt good.

10:59.692 --> 11:00.827
Bye, guys.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.228
Harvey's taking me out
for sushi

11:02.228 --> 11:03.663
then we're going
to a late movie.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.297
Don't wait up.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.899
Hold on, you're going out?
Two days ago

11:05.899 --> 11:08.835
you were completely overwhelmed
by your schoolwork and your job.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.737
Well, that was then;
this is now.

11:10.737 --> 11:13.473
I've got both situations
firmly under control.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.474
Buh-bye.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.210
Why is everyone in the universe
dating except us?

11:17.210 --> 11:18.545
Well,I'm working on why I'm
not

11:18.545 --> 11:21.080
and there's no cure
for why you're not.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.683
Roxie, you're right--
dating is for the birds

11:23.683 --> 11:26.286
and all the other annoying
animals with high voices.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.887
What happened? I thought tonight
was going to be the night

11:27.887 --> 11:29.422
you were going to say
"I love you" to Josh.

11:29.422 --> 11:32.225
Well, for some reason, it was a
lot easier to say to the mirror.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.693
Maybe you have
intimacy issues.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.496
I wish; I'd kill
for intimacy issues.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.165
I've got an idea. Why
don't you come with me to my
relationship workshop?

11:39.165 --> 11:40.233
Maybe it'll give you
some insight

11:40.233 --> 11:41.801
into what's holding
you back with Josh.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.036
MILES:
And if that
doesn't work

11:43.036 --> 11:44.404
you have a roommate
who is well-versed

11:44.404 --> 11:45.905
in the ways of isolation
and misery.

11:45.905 --> 11:46.839
That's true.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.975
You and I can always be
miserable together.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.911
Actually, I was
talking about Roxie.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.648
And actually,
I don't think I have
relationship problems.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.283
I just don't
like people.

11:57.283 --> 12:00.119
Uh, nothing
personal.

12:00.119 --> 12:00.687
WOMAN:
Well, you've come

12:00.687 --> 12:01.788
a long way, Bob.

12:01.788 --> 12:04.724
Which says a whole lot
about where you started.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.093
Anybody else
got something to share?

12:07.093 --> 12:09.195
Roxie?
I think one of my problems

12:09.195 --> 12:12.198
with guys is
that I immediately start
looking for flaws.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.734
They talk too much,
they don't talk enough

12:14.734 --> 12:17.403
they're too fat, too skinny...

12:17.403 --> 12:19.205
I think my expectations
are too high.

12:19.205 --> 12:20.640
Except for that one guy
that you dated

12:20.640 --> 12:22.575
that cleaned his ears
with the end of his glasses.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.543
Whew!

12:23.543 --> 12:24.744
Loser!

12:24.744 --> 12:26.813
Well,the point is
Roxie has owned up

12:26.813 --> 12:28.081
to how her critical nature

12:28.081 --> 12:30.717
could be sabotaging
her chances for happiness.

12:30.717 --> 12:31.784
That's very good.

12:31.784 --> 12:32.819
Uh, Sabrina?

12:32.819 --> 12:34.554
We haven't heard
from you yet.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.990
What's going on
in your relationship?

12:36.990 --> 12:38.958
Well, I have
a really cool boyfriend.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.460
He's caring and thoughtful

12:40.460 --> 12:42.962
and we have a really great time
together...

12:42.962 --> 12:44.564
and he just told me
that he loves me.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.966
And you came here
to mock us.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.335
That is, like,
so mean.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.136
WOMAN:
Sabrina,

12:50.136 --> 12:52.739
what's wrong
with your relationship?

12:52.739 --> 12:56.309
Well, whenever I try
to tell Josh that I love him

12:56.309 --> 12:57.243
it comes out wacky.

12:57.243 --> 12:58.344
Wacky?

12:58.344 --> 13:00.079
Yeah, I get really
animated, you know?

13:00.079 --> 13:01.014
Like, goofy.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.849
Well maybe there's
something that's
preventing you

13:02.849 --> 13:04.917
from expressing
your real feelings.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.419
Now, have you two
been completely honest

13:06.419 --> 13:07.553
with each other?

13:07.553 --> 13:11.057
Well, I feel he's been
totally honest with me and...

13:11.057 --> 13:13.293
( <i>male French accent):</i>
<i>moi,</i> I've been totally honest
with him.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.828
Sabrina, making fun
of what we're doing here

13:15.828 --> 13:17.830
isn't helping you
confront your
real issues.

13:17.830 --> 13:19.532
I--I know, I know; I didn't
mean to make fun of you.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.101
Look, is there anything
important about yourself

13:22.101 --> 13:23.870
that you may have kept
from your boyfriend?

13:23.870 --> 13:25.338
( <i>cartoon voice</i> ):
No, nothing, nothing at all.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.407
Gotta go!

13:30.643 --> 13:33.012
( <i>cartoon voice</i> ):
What a revoltin' development.

13:40.853 --> 13:42.789
(turns on TV)

13:42.789 --> 13:43.990
Very considerate.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.259
Just come in here
and turn on the TV

13:46.259 --> 13:48.494
completely ignoring
the fact that I am
reading.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.530
Have you no respect
for knowledge?

13:51.064 --> 13:53.333
Have you no respect
for the poor working Joe

13:53.333 --> 13:54.367
who's trying to serve
a cup of joe

13:54.367 --> 13:56.169
to a bunch of guys
named "Joe"?

13:56.169 --> 13:58.404
Well, maybe you wouldn't
be serving joe to Joe

13:58.404 --> 14:00.606
if you cracked open
a book now and then.

14:00.606 --> 14:03.076
Oh, boy, I love
a good cat fight!

14:03.076 --> 14:06.312
Ladies and gentlemen,
get ready to rumble.

14:06.312 --> 14:08.281
Listen, Miss <i>Summa Cum</i>
Loudmouth:

14:08.281 --> 14:10.183
it's know-it-all
teachers like you

14:10.183 --> 14:13.786
that drove me
to clown college.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.221
Aunt Hilda,
Aunt Zelda...

14:15.221 --> 14:16.356
I'm a cartoon.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.624
Oh, and you're
very funny, honey.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.326
What am I saying?

14:22.562 --> 14:24.030
Thanks...

14:24.030 --> 14:25.131
I think.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.433
Well, I finally
figured out the reason

14:27.433 --> 14:29.168
I can't say "I love you"
to Josh.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.404
I'm convinced the only way
I can tell Josh I love him

14:31.404 --> 14:33.406
without sounding
like Tweety Bird

14:33.406 --> 14:34.807
is to tell him I'm a witch.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.342
But, Sabrina,
that's impossible.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.810
If you tell a mortal
you're a witch

14:37.810 --> 14:39.312
you'll be stripped
of your powers

14:39.312 --> 14:40.313
and cast out forever.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.047
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.383
How about term limits
for that Witches Council?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.452
Might I bring up the fact
that Harvey knows she's a witch

14:46.452 --> 14:47.887
and nothing happened to her.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.356
That's because
he figured it out
on his own.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.058
Wait a minute!

14:52.058 --> 14:53.459
What if I don't tell Josh

14:53.459 --> 14:55.828
and he figures it out
the way Harvey did.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.930
Then, there wouldn't be
any consequences at all.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.866
Except for one tiny detail.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.401
When Harvey found out
you were a witch

15:01.401 --> 15:03.536
he dumped you
like yesterday's trash.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.705
That's a risk
I'll just have to take.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.508
You dumped yesterday's trash?

15:08.508 --> 15:10.510
That was today's lunch.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.380
Hi, Josh.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.383
So, has Sabrina
talked to you yet?

15:17.383 --> 15:18.851
No. About what?

15:18.851 --> 15:20.052
Never mind.
I know nothing.

15:20.052 --> 15:21.754
You'll never pull it
out of me.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.164
Hey, Harvey.
What you got there?

15:31.164 --> 15:32.031
Coffee.

15:32.031 --> 15:35.535
That's what I generally get
when I come to a coffeehouse.

15:35.535 --> 15:39.672
Well, I think I know
why you and Sabrina
broke up.

15:39.672 --> 15:40.973
You do?

15:40.973 --> 15:42.275
How did you
figure it out?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.143
The weird way
she was acting.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.178
Oh, yeah.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.047
She can do
some pretty strange things.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.749
Did she turn you
into a puppy yet?

15:49.749 --> 15:51.517
Oh, she tried to.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.886
It's obvious all she wanted
to do was play with me.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.656
I've been one thanks to her.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.859
But nothing compared to the time
she made me pregnant.

15:59.859 --> 16:00.860
Pregnant?

16:01.527 --> 16:03.095
What are you talking about?

16:03.095 --> 16:04.764
What are <i>you</i> talking about?

16:04.764 --> 16:06.833
I'm talking about how
you tell a girl you love her

16:06.833 --> 16:08.701
and she treats it
like a joke.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.303
O-oh... right.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.271
Don't you just hate that?

16:14.273 --> 16:15.341
Ahh...

16:16.742 --> 16:19.412
How am I supposed to make Josh
guess that I'm a witch

16:19.412 --> 16:21.180
without revealing
that I'm a witch?

16:21.180 --> 16:23.950
Well, you could dress
up in a big pointy hat

16:23.950 --> 16:26.486
walk in with a
broom, and cackle.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.453
Too small.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.689
He would just think
that I was celebrating
Halloween early.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.591
Okay, let's cut
to the chase.

16:31.591 --> 16:36.195
You create darkness
across the land;
make it rain frogs.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.397
Too big and too messy.

16:38.397 --> 16:41.267
All right, all right,
stop twisting my paw.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.135
I'll tell him
you're a witch.

16:43.135 --> 16:45.338
Hmm. You intentionally
reveal yourself

16:45.338 --> 16:46.672
as a talking cat to a mortal

16:46.672 --> 16:48.641
and the Witches Council
will turn you into a doormat.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.309
It wouldn't be
the first time

16:50.309 --> 16:52.812
people have walked
all over me.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.780
Let's talk boils
and carbuncles.

16:55.615 --> 16:56.983
Oh, hi, Morgan.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.117
Here's your
makeup test.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.653
And I was so looking forward
to taking it

17:00.653 --> 17:02.989
but my slave driver boss
just paged me

17:02.989 --> 17:04.824
to mop and wax all the floors.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.592
Did you tell her about the test?

17:06.592 --> 17:10.563
I tried, but, alas,
it was not to be.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.464
I better hurry.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.834
I get docked ten dollars
for every minute that I'm late.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.335
Well, that's it.

17:16.335 --> 17:18.604
That witch is going down.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.773
Hi, Zellie;
what are you doing here?

17:20.773 --> 17:22.575
I am fighting
the forces of ignorance

17:22.575 --> 17:24.076
before they
completely annihilate

17:24.076 --> 17:26.212
all forms
of intelligent life.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.113
Huh?

17:27.113 --> 17:28.514
I'm talking about you.

17:28.514 --> 17:29.949
Why are you working
poor Morgan

17:29.949 --> 17:32.051
like she's on
a prison road crew?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.353
Hey, you're the one who's got
her studying day and night

17:34.353 --> 17:37.323
for your stupid 700-
question makeup test.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.759
Fortunately, the
compassionate
Spellman sister

17:39.759 --> 17:41.961
has given Morgan
time off from work.

17:41.961 --> 17:45.398
What? Hilda,
we've been hoodwinked

17:45.398 --> 17:47.733
bamboozled,
led down the primrose path

17:47.733 --> 17:50.269
and shoved
into a thicket of thorns.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.404
Huh?

17:54.006 --> 17:55.374
Too many people around.

17:55.374 --> 17:56.609
Since Josh and I
need to be alone

17:56.609 --> 17:59.045
make everybody want
an ice cream cone.
( <i>ice cream truck music plays)</i>

18:00.346 --> 18:04.216
Oh, boy-- the ice
cream man is here!

18:08.254 --> 18:10.590
What are you doing here?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.858
I need to explain
what's been going on.

18:12.858 --> 18:15.361
Josh, there was a reason
why I sounded so weird

18:15.361 --> 18:17.330
when I tried to
tell you how I felt.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.066
It's because there's something
about me that you don't know.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.233
Okay, wait, let me guess.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.035
You're really
from the planet Krypton

18:23.035 --> 18:25.304
disguised as
a mild-mannered reporter?

18:25.304 --> 18:26.939
No, but awfully good guess.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.274
Sabrina, I don't want
to play any more games.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.141
I've got work to do.

18:29.141 --> 18:32.078
Please, Josh, just
listen to me
for one minute.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.279
Why do you think
an ice cream truck

18:33.279 --> 18:35.081
just suddenly showed
up at 11:30 at night?

18:35.081 --> 18:37.984
I don't know--
the ice cream man's nocturnal?

18:37.984 --> 18:39.151
Okay.

18:39.151 --> 18:40.119
What about
that hockey game

18:40.119 --> 18:42.555
when Harvey suddenly went
from having a horrible injury

18:42.555 --> 18:43.522
to setting scoring records--

18:43.522 --> 18:45.524
didn't you find that
a little strange?

18:45.524 --> 18:47.026
Not as strange as
Harvey telling me

18:47.026 --> 18:48.260
you made him pregnant.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.295
Now, if you'd excuse me

18:49.295 --> 18:51.764
I've got a whole disc
of photos to print out.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.467
You mean those?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.669
Oh. Where did
those come from?

18:57.703 --> 18:59.672
Good question;
where do you think?

18:59.672 --> 19:02.174
Oh, Charlie must
have printed them out
before he left.

19:02.174 --> 19:03.943
What a great guy.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.745
Okay, let's go another way.

19:06.445 --> 19:09.181
How do you think that plant
turned into a tree?

19:09.181 --> 19:11.083
Where did that monkey come from?

19:11.083 --> 19:12.051
And I don't know
if you've noticed

19:12.051 --> 19:14.687
but there's a monsoon
going on in that corner.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.590
Who in the world
could have possibly done that?!

19:17.590 --> 19:18.724
Sabrina, I don't get it.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.726
First, you mock me
with cartoon voices.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.328
Now you're playing
practical jokes

19:22.328 --> 19:24.630
with water, plants,
and a monkey?

19:24.630 --> 19:25.898
Why are you doing this?

19:25.898 --> 19:27.867
Because I want you to know
who I really am.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.135
If this is who
you really are

19:29.135 --> 19:30.403
I don't want
any part of it.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.637
Josh, please don't go.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.739
Oh, yeah? Give me one
good reason why I shouldn't.

19:33.739 --> 19:38.177
Because... because I love you!

19:38.177 --> 19:39.245
What did you say?

19:39.245 --> 19:40.479
I love you.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.647
Oh, my gosh, did you hear that?

19:41.647 --> 19:43.315
I said "I love you,"
and it came out right.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.316
I love you.

19:44.316 --> 19:45.317
Did you really mean it?

19:45.317 --> 19:50.656
Yes! I love you, Josh.
( <i>monkey claps and squeals)</i>

19:53.893 --> 19:57.463
Sabrina, I don't always
understand you, and...

19:57.463 --> 20:01.033
I have no idea where
you got a monkey at this hour

20:01.033 --> 20:02.668
but I love you, too.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.605
Honey, we're so glad

20:06.605 --> 20:08.040
things worked out
between you and Josh.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.208
So am I.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.476
But I still don't understand

20:10.476 --> 20:12.845
why I could suddenly say
"I love you" in a normal voice.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.947
I mean, Josh never figured out
that I was a witch.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.283
I think you were able
to profess your love to Josh

20:17.283 --> 20:18.284
because you were willing

20:18.284 --> 20:20.019
to reveal yourself completely
to him.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.721
And, lucky for you

20:21.721 --> 20:23.622
Josh is a total dimwit.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.558
Salem. The point is

20:25.558 --> 20:27.660
being as open as
you could about
your witch side

20:27.660 --> 20:29.929
absolved your guilt about
having to deceive a mortal.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.832
Huh?
Don't worry, I got it.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.966
Which reminds me.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.335
You know anyone
who needs a monkey?
<i>(monkey claps)</i>

20:42.942 --> 20:44.910
Roxie? Hey, I just
want to apologize

20:44.910 --> 20:47.480
for acting so weird
yesterday at the workshop.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.348
See, I'm taking
this other workshop

20:49.348 --> 20:51.050
where I learn
cartoon voices

20:51.050 --> 20:52.518
and I got all mixed up.

20:52.518 --> 20:53.519
Don't apologize.

20:53.519 --> 20:54.587
I should be thanking you.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.255
Why?
Well, after you left

20:56.255 --> 20:57.523
people started
making fun of you

20:57.523 --> 20:58.824
and it got everybody
loosened up.

20:58.824 --> 20:59.792
Saturday night
I'm going out

20:59.792 --> 21:01.193
with the guy
who hates everybody.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.529
Hmm. I have a good
feeling about this one.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.765
I'm here, but I can't stay.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.133
Of course not.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.501
You poor thing.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.503
Is that Zelda
torturing you again?

21:10.503 --> 21:12.371
Sadly, yes.

21:12.371 --> 21:13.639
She's threatened
to flunk me

21:13.639 --> 21:16.709
if I don't take that pointless
makeup test today.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.812
And lucky for you,
I have it right here.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.214
Oh, and when you're done with
that, there are green tiles

21:22.214 --> 21:24.517
in the bathroom
that are supposed
to be white.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.451
ZELDA:
Have fun.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.686
Nobody messes with
the Spellman sisters.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.622
Mm-mm-mm-mmm.
