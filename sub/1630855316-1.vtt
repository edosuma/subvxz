EMILY BRONTË
THE COMPLETE POEMS

00:51.720 --> 00:53.000
Noah, are you ready?

01:34.080 --> 01:36.280
My
Fault

02:10.400 --> 02:11.560
What are you reading?

02:11.640 --> 02:14.600
JANE AUSTEN
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

02:14.680 --> 02:17.120
Just tell me. I'm not wearing my glasses.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.840
You're not going to talk to me?

02:24.560 --> 02:26.160
This isn't easy for me either.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.760
You spend your life
trying to get to the next level,

02:29.840 --> 02:33.000
but the same monster
keeps getting in your way.

02:33.079 --> 02:35.760
But one day,
when you've run out of hit points,

02:35.840 --> 02:39.520
you're given
an extra chance at life, just like that.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.400
Mom, enough video game metaphors.
I'm not ten.

02:42.480 --> 02:46.160
Well, it's like opening a new book
and a new story begins. Better?

02:46.680 --> 02:50.680
Damn it, Noah. Now we'll be
the main characters of our own lives.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.680
Your life. Mine's 1,000 km away.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.200
Now I'm all by myself
just for a fucking whim.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.160
-Will and I love each other.
-Don't want to hear it.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.600
Well, we love each other.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.680
I love somebody too
and you didn't care.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.520
I didn't want to keep you
from Dan and your friends.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.080
Noah, you're 17.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.320
I'm sure you'll make friends
being this nice.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.520
I'm not in the mood.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.160
Honey, St. Marie is a good school.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.079
It has a great volleyball team.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.960
-You'll be the captain in no time.
-Don't you get it?

03:19.040 --> 03:22.240
I don't wanna go to a fancy school
a stranger is paying for.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.520
He's not a stranger, he's my husband.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.280
So get used to it.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.200
Hi, Manuel!

04:09.680 --> 04:10.920
Will, honey!

04:11.000 --> 04:12.200
Hi.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.760
How was the trip?

04:15.840 --> 04:17.560
I'll tell you later.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.600
Please, miss.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.960
-I can do it, thanks.
-It is my duty.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.880
-Allow me. Allow me, miss.
-No.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.320
-I can do it!
-Allow me.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.640
Let Martín help you.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.200
Let me take the suitcase!

04:31.440 --> 04:32.960
You win, Mortimer.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.400
-I'm so happy to see you, Noah.
-I can't say the same, I'm sorry.

04:38.920 --> 04:43.560
Well, I just want you to feel at home
and for you to consider me your family.

04:43.640 --> 04:44.720
At some point.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.640
Why don't we show you around?

04:48.920 --> 04:50.080
Take it easy.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.720
-Good morning.
-Ma'am.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.480
All right, sir.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.480
This is the hallway, that's the kitchen,
the bedrooms are upstairs.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.640
-This is the spa.
-And the gym.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.440
This saves you quite a few maneuvers!

05:19.520 --> 05:21.000
Don't you have a library?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.600
Or a guest room
where I can be alone and rest for a while?

05:45.240 --> 05:47.000
Your favorite colors.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.240
A decorator helped me,
but I chose most of it.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.240
I don't know what to say.

05:53.320 --> 05:57.120
I wanted you to have what
you always wanted but I couldn't give you.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.680
It's amazing.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.960
-Thanks.
-You deserve it, sweetie.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.640
Okay, Mom.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.120
And it's not a guest room.

06:12.680 --> 06:13.680
I'm sorry.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.360
In fact, Nicholas' room is next door.

06:16.440 --> 06:21.240
Oh, right, Nick.
Daddy's boy, the perfect son... How cool.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.200
Listen to me.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.600
As perfect as he may be,
he's your stepbrother now.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.920
You have the same right
to be in this house.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.240
You know I'll never see it like that.

06:30.320 --> 06:34.120
And I won't stop
until you see this as it is, our home.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.720
Now unpack.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.520
This is obscene.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.680
Very funny.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.240
The ringtone you had was so dull.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.080
-How do I change it?
-Don't!

07:41.159 --> 07:42.600
I want you to hate me.

07:42.680 --> 07:43.760
Hate you?

07:43.840 --> 07:46.520
I don't want you to bug me
about how you miss me.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.080
Well, suck it up,
because I miss you already.

07:49.159 --> 07:52.159
Well, I hate you. I'm so jealous.
That dressing room!

07:52.240 --> 07:54.680
I'm not going to wear
any of those dresses.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.280
Are you crazy? Enjoy it!

07:56.360 --> 07:58.280
I can't stand all this extravagance.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.080
The house smells like poodle perfume.

08:01.160 --> 08:05.360
Can you picture me in the spa cuddling up
to one of those pompoms on legs?

08:05.440 --> 08:08.080
So I have to feel sorry for you
for being rich?

08:08.160 --> 08:10.920
Today it's family dinner
at the sailing club.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.320
I'll puke overboard.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.800
Look, his great-grandfather
was an English admiral.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.680
Enough to make you puke again.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.800
-Post millions of photos, please.
-Yes, I will.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.120
I didn't eat anything and I'm starving.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.800
Why don't you ask your butler?

08:24.880 --> 08:28.000
I bet these people
don't even have a lousy sandwich.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.400
Just as I expected,
not one goddamn sandwich.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.400
Shit!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.520
You must be my dad's new wife's daughter.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.559
How about an Angus ragout?
Some ramen? An apple strudel?

08:44.360 --> 08:48.000
Don't know what you eat in Yokel-land,
but if you're gonna throw it up...

08:48.760 --> 08:52.240
-Nicholas, right?
-That's right. And you are?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.520
-Seriously?
-Are you still there?

08:54.600 --> 08:55.760
-Noah?
-Noah?

08:56.800 --> 08:58.080
Isn't that a boy's name?

08:58.640 --> 09:01.760
Your limited vocabulary
doesn't include the word "unisex"?

09:04.160 --> 09:07.440
Do you know what Thor's favorite word
from my vocabulary is?

09:08.320 --> 09:09.600
It starts with "a,"

09:10.880 --> 09:12.480
then "tta,"

09:13.160 --> 09:14.480
and ends with "ck."

09:14.560 --> 09:16.960
-It's not funny.
-He doesn't like you.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.920
He must think
you snuck in without permission.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.560
But that's not true, is it?

09:21.640 --> 09:23.400
That's enough, Nicholas!

09:23.480 --> 09:25.560
He's like a poodle, but smarter.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.840
Did you hit your head as a baby, you jerk?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.320
Thor hates it when people insult me.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.000
-Relax!
-Say something, damn it!

09:36.080 --> 09:37.600
Thor, stop.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.600
-What are you doing?
-Seriously, or I'll hit you.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.560
If he senses a threat,
he'll rip you to shreds.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.480
-You'll still get a pan in the head.
-Thor, sit!

09:49.760 --> 09:51.640
You're crazy, aren't you?

09:54.880 --> 09:58.920
By the way, from a distance,
I couldn't see your freckles, sis.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.400
I'm not your sister nor anything like it.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.720
Hey! I see you've already met.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.280
Oh, yes, Nick is very nice.
But I like Thor best.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.640
Right, cutie? Come here.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.840
Come here, little guy! Hey!

10:11.680 --> 10:14.240
I don't know what's wrong.
I must scare him.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.640
That was awesome!

10:27.280 --> 10:28.120
Betty?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.840
-You're still there?
-My God, your stepbrother!

10:30.920 --> 10:33.240
Was that the sweet boy your mom mentioned?

10:33.320 --> 10:34.880
You see? A total dick.

10:34.960 --> 10:35.920
Is he hot, though?

10:36.480 --> 10:38.720
So you're a gossip and a pervert.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.560
So he's a total hottie, then?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.160
I don't know. I didn't really look at him.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.640
I don't mind the lack of punctuality,
but this dinner is bad timing.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.600
I'm sorry, it's not negotiable.

10:54.440 --> 10:58.160
She must be choosing a dress.
We went overboard in the store.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.720
Right, sweetie?

11:09.400 --> 11:10.880
You look stunning, Noah.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.480
Let's go.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.960
Why don't you take a picture?

11:29.520 --> 11:31.080
Next time, you're driving.

11:31.160 --> 11:35.120
Should I change the music?
Maybe she likes something more... Right?

11:35.200 --> 11:37.120
You're riding shotgun, you choose.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.760
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS

11:38.840 --> 11:41.320
-Is the temperature okay?
-Yes, don't turn it up.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.000
No? You like it cool?

11:43.080 --> 11:44.760
-Hands on the wheel.
-No...

11:44.840 --> 11:46.400
On the wheel, please!

11:46.480 --> 11:48.480
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
GOTTA GO. LOVE YOU

11:48.560 --> 11:50.880
-It's a straight road.
-You smell great.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.240
-7654. Nick.
-There's Nick.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.800
Noah, your membership card
will arrive next week.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.880
Meanwhile, you can use my surname.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.120
-Won't that be confusing?
-Why would it be?

12:26.200 --> 12:27.240
Hello, Mr. Leister.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.000
Hi. I'm Mrs. Leister. Noah Leister.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.200
Congratulations, sir. I did hear rumors.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.280
No, Antonio, no. I'm not that kind of guy.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.600
This is Mrs. Leister.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.760
-I'm sorry, how silly of me.
-Don't worry. It wasn't your fault.

12:41.840 --> 12:42.840
Come on.

12:51.440 --> 12:57.400
Summer has never been my favorite season,
but with this sea, the sunsets, you...

12:57.480 --> 12:58.880
This city amazes me.

12:59.720 --> 13:04.160
Ranked as one of the most charming places
in the world by National Geographic.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.280
Thanks to our lobbying.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.320
Are there a lot
of forest fires around here?

13:09.400 --> 13:12.280
Yes, Noah, unfortunately,
it's a blight on our city.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.560
There have been two already this summer.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.920
I don't get people
who throw cigarette butts out the window.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.600
Ever had points
deducted from your license?

13:21.680 --> 13:24.200
For doing that? Impossible.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.440
Nick doesn't smoke.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.640
He's an athlete. Surfing champion, right?

13:27.720 --> 13:29.760
-Yes.
-Surfing?

13:29.840 --> 13:31.040
Is there a problem?

13:31.120 --> 13:34.880
No, I just prefer
team and strategic sports.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.120
Where you have to use your intelligence.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.480
If you'll excuse me, I have to go to work.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.960
-At Mikel's?
-Yes.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.560
-Your first case?
-I wish.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.240
His dad asked us
to take care of the paperwork.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.080
He studies law, and gets great grades.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.720
But it's all strength of mind,
no intelligence.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.760
Don't worry, if you're fired
from Mikel's dad's firm,

13:55.840 --> 13:57.320
you'll still have your dad's.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.880
There'll always be
a Leister Enterprises subsidiary to milk.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.440
-Right, Nick?
-Noah, please.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.400
It's fine.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.960
My evening was going to be dull...

14:06.040 --> 14:08.280
Now we'll have something to laugh about.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.440
See you later, sis.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.960
-I'm leaving too.
-You're staying.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.240
No, wait. Nick.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.800
Can you take her home?
Isn't it on the way?

14:21.880 --> 14:23.680
Not really, it's quite the detour.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.240
-I'd rather take a taxi.
-That's enough.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.800
We won't tolerate this attitude.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.280
-It's best if you get along.
-Will's right.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.280
Go with Nick, don't worry.
He's a careful driver.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.000
-What are you doing?
-What's your problem now?

14:44.080 --> 14:47.080
I don't want to die
because of a lunatic who can't drive.

14:47.160 --> 14:50.040
-You think you could do better?
-Wanna bet?

14:50.120 --> 14:53.400
You're in my house, in my city,
and my car, so shut up.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.240
Just because you own things
you think you're gods.

14:56.320 --> 15:01.360
Well, you're in my personal space,
my comfort zone, and my sight, so go away!

15:01.440 --> 15:04.120
Your mom must love you
a lot to put up with you.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.680
What would you know about a mother's love?

15:10.040 --> 15:11.640
-What are you doing?
-Get out.

15:11.720 --> 15:15.360
-Why? What did I say?
-Get out or I'll get you out myself.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.120
You wouldn't dare.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.960
Nick!

15:20.480 --> 15:21.880
What is he doing?

15:21.960 --> 15:23.960
No way, no.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.000
Nicholas!

15:25.080 --> 15:26.920
Nick, let go of me!

15:27.000 --> 15:29.320
-What are you doing?
-Call that taxi.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.640
-No taxi will pick me up here.
-Uber, then.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.640
Nick!

15:34.240 --> 15:35.520
Nick!

15:36.400 --> 15:40.040
Nick, seriously? You're not even going
to give me a safety vest?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.840
This can't be happening to me.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.080
And now I'm out of battery. God damn...
Fuck! That asshole!

15:50.680 --> 15:51.960
Fuck.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.040
Come on...

16:06.120 --> 16:09.520
Fine, don't stop.
I bet you're a serial killer.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.200
I dodged a bullet there.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.560
Shit.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.480
-Hey, are you okay?
-Yeah.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.800
Some jerk left me stranded here.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.880
All alone, in the middle of nowhere?

16:28.600 --> 16:31.360
Yes, all alone, in the middle of nowhere.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.600
-All right, bye.
-No, hey!

16:33.680 --> 16:37.040
Wait. Okay, I know that sounded bad.

16:37.120 --> 16:40.960
But it's true. I can't leave you
all alone in the middle of nowhere.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.560
Okay, that sounds better.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.000
Do you have an iPhone charger?

16:48.320 --> 16:52.240
What a day. I couldn't even take
my charger out of my suitcase.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.480
So...

16:54.280 --> 16:56.960
-Where am I taking you?
-Where are you headed?

16:57.520 --> 17:00.320
To some random party at a villa out here.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.400
I'd invite you, but if what I said
sounded bad,

17:03.480 --> 17:05.440
you'll think I'm gonna dismember you.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.000
The surprise guest, right?

17:07.880 --> 17:10.480
-Where do you live?
-Know where the Leisters live?

17:10.560 --> 17:12.440
Of course. Do you live near there?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.839
-I live there.
-What?

17:15.520 --> 17:17.119
You live in Nicholas' house?

17:17.200 --> 17:19.359
Worse. He's my stepbrother.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.040
-And the one who left me stranded.
-Nick?

17:23.119 --> 17:24.440
What an asshole.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.600
Well, now I get it.
He didn't have time to drop you home.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.600
-What do you mean?
-He wanted to get there early.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.480
-Get where?
-To the party I just told you about.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.160
Hold on, Nick is there?

17:37.240 --> 17:39.240
There's no party without Nick.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.720
Noah, listen.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.160
It's a gang get-together, so be careful.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.600
That's the most dangerous one over there.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.760
That guy in white is Ronnie.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.920
Got out of prison yesterday.
To give you an idea of what the deal is.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.680
What's up?

18:20.720 --> 18:22.760
-How are you?
-Yo, Ronnie.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.360
-Good to see you.
-You good? How are you?

18:28.440 --> 18:31.520
Listen. You've got
the purples, the greens,

18:31.600 --> 18:33.920
the blues, and then there's our gang.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.640
And that's our leader.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.280
Let's go!

18:41.880 --> 18:43.440
How's it going, man?

18:44.680 --> 18:45.520
Drink!

18:46.880 --> 18:48.200
Yeah!

19:26.080 --> 19:29.240
-What are you doing here?
-Surprised I made it on foot?

19:29.320 --> 19:31.120
-Who'd you come with?
-Shithead.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.600
Freckles, just go back
to where you came from.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.000
I'm staying here
until I want to leave.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.040
-I won't repeat it.
-You're in no position to order me.

19:39.120 --> 19:42.360
-I'm not?
-What if your dad finds out about this?

19:43.840 --> 19:46.000
-You wouldn't dare.
-The perfect boy, huh?

19:46.080 --> 19:47.960
Damn. You've really fooled everyone.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.640
-I'm perfect in many ways, honey.
-Modesty isn't one of them.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.920
The other girls
are not concerned about that.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I'm not like most other girls.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.400
You're not? I'd say you are.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.520
Ordinary lips...

20:02.880 --> 20:04.440
An empty gaze...

20:05.840 --> 20:07.200
A neck...

20:08.040 --> 20:09.600
-What's that?
-A knot.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.280
To show how twisted you are?

20:11.360 --> 20:13.440
-To show how strong I am.
-Strong.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.760
A figure-of-eight knot,
the hardest to undo.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.160
There's no knot too hard for me.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.760
Just by kissing their tattoos,
girls loosen up.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.040
-How can you be sure everyone likes you?
-Small details.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.120
-Such as?
-You haven't asked me to let go of you.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.200
Obviously I want you to let go!

20:31.280 --> 20:34.160
Never mind. I like women,
not girls with braids.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.840
-I never wear braids.
-Look, sis,

20:36.920 --> 20:39.280
you have no idea what you're getting into.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.720
So stay out of my way,
and I'll stay out of yours. Got it?

20:44.840 --> 20:45.720
Asshole.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.440
Can I help you?

20:54.760 --> 20:56.720
-Shit, sorry. Is this your Jeep?
-No.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.040
Just some creep's
who snuck into the party.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.360
Wreck it, if you want.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.520
You're Noah, right?

21:03.840 --> 21:06.800
If Nick sent you to watch over me,
I don't need it.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.680
I'm not here for him.
Mario told me what he did.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.840
-Are you his girlfriend?
-Mario's? No.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.320
No, Nick's. He's got his tongue
down every girl's throat.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.240
Nick and I go way back.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.800
-I feel sorry for you, he's a jerk.
-He has his days.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.920
Hey, what's up? Cheers!

21:32.680 --> 21:34.000
What's up, dog?

21:35.240 --> 21:37.040
How are you? Sorry for the trouble.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.960
If I'd taken the sports car,
I wouldn't have had an excuse.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.000
No worries, I'll take the 4x4.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.960
-Fuck.
-What is it?

21:44.040 --> 21:47.640
I can't see my boyfriend's
and my best friend's stories.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.680
So you need a new boyfriend
and a new best friend.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.000
-I'm Jenna.
-Nice to meet you.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.840
-I must've just pressed something.
-Look at me.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.200
Forget about that, girl.
Take off your bra, get drunk,

21:59.280 --> 22:01.960
and make out with the hottest guy.
In that order.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.720
I'm not really into all that,
regardless of the order.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.800
Who's that hottie talking to Jenna?

22:08.360 --> 22:10.840
Hottie? You're tripping, dude.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.320
Go on, get out of here.

22:13.040 --> 22:16.160
Put this on so Ronnie's gang members
don't bother you.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.440
Anything I can put on
to keep Nick away?

22:18.520 --> 22:20.960
Hey! Hello, ladies.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.400
-Hi, man.
-Hi.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.200
Hey! Hey, shoo!

22:25.280 --> 22:27.160
No, this is Lion, my boyfriend.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.000
-He's one of ours.
-Welcome to the club, then.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Okay.

23:08.760 --> 23:09.960
Hi.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.640
So you're Nick's sister.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.960
Damn, news sure travels fast, Ronnie.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.160
Yeah.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.080
What's up?

23:27.680 --> 23:28.760
Coke or mojito?

23:31.720 --> 23:33.080
-Coke.
-Here.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.440
-Shit, this has rum in it.
-Just a little.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.800
-No, thanks.
-Drink, it's good.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.400
-No, thank you.
-Drink, don't be silly.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.840
-What the hell?
-Last time you crash my party.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.520
Get your Jeep and scram before I kill you.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.920
Why do guys
solve everything with violence?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.200
Right. I'm still hurting from your punch.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.080
We agreed to stay out of each other's way.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.920
What are you doing?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.640
That asshole
goes around spiking girls' drinks.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.240
What? Shit.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.880
-I'm taking you home.
-No, I'm going with Mario.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.480
Mario! Mario?

24:22.440 --> 24:25.520
I'm fine, I just feel a little hot, okay?

24:27.760 --> 24:30.800
Hey, leave me alone.
I'm just cold, damn it.

24:31.440 --> 24:34.720
No, man, not again. No, let me drive.

24:34.800 --> 24:38.040
-I've always wanted to drive one of these.
-My baby? Never.

24:38.120 --> 24:41.480
-You're drugged and don't have a license.
-I'm just dizzy.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.120
You did drink, though.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.280
Just one shot.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.560
Yeah, but off of someone's boobs.

24:48.080 --> 24:53.520
Nice and salty tequila mixed with sweat.
Tasty, huh?

25:00.000 --> 25:04.240
What would Freud say about pouring liquids
and sucking them all up like that?

25:05.200 --> 25:08.760
Freud isn't some trap singer,
just so you know.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.920
He'd say that it's like shedding tears,
or something worse,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.280
on your mother's breasts.
So suck on that!

25:14.360 --> 25:15.960
Leave my mom alone.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.560
Sweetie, where's the Bohemian glass?

25:19.640 --> 25:20.560
What's the matter?

25:21.800 --> 25:26.480
Your mom never taught you that there's
a thing called a glass to pour liquids in?

25:26.560 --> 25:29.680
Hey, Darcy, my friend!
This is your great-grandson.

25:29.760 --> 25:32.560
But don't be fooled,
he's no English dandy like you,

25:32.640 --> 25:34.480
even with a damsel in his arms.

25:35.240 --> 25:36.160
Oh, my!

25:36.800 --> 25:38.640
What's this?

25:38.720 --> 25:42.320
I bet you drink your steroids
out of a glass though, right?

25:42.400 --> 25:44.960
Well, you know what? Glass is a liquid.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.520
A liquid that holds another liquid.
Neat, right?

25:49.760 --> 25:53.000
If you were capable of having emotions,
you'd appreciate it.

25:54.240 --> 25:58.040
Glass flows so slowly
that it appears solid.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.280
That's why it's so fragile.

26:01.040 --> 26:04.160
Hard, but fragile.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.600
No, not the light!

26:17.640 --> 26:18.600
Don't touch me.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.000
Asshole.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.600
Noah.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.160
Sweetheart, wake up.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.440
-Sweetheart.
-Rafaella!

26:43.520 --> 26:45.120
Come, honey.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.560
Come on.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.040
Get in here.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.960
-Here.
-What's going on?

26:52.040 --> 26:53.520
Open the fucking door!

26:54.520 --> 26:55.920
Don't come out, okay?

26:58.400 --> 27:00.600
Open it or I'll break it!

27:17.480 --> 27:20.520
-Working at Mikel's house, were you?
-Yes.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.680
-Ibuprofen?
-Thanks, Martín.

27:24.240 --> 27:28.120
-Coffee, miss?
-Thanks, Mortimer, I'll get it myself.

27:28.960 --> 27:32.080
-What happened last night?
-You really don't remember?

27:33.360 --> 27:36.520
-This'll be fun.
-When your dad walks through that door.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.160
-We'll see who ends up worse off.
-Tell me.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.840
I put you into bed
and lots of things happened.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.000
You didn't touch me.

27:44.080 --> 27:47.840
That's what a psychopath would do.
You're more twisted, Nick Leister.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.880
-Really?
-I know you did something.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.600
-Did you record me?
-No.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.720
I should have, you were very funny.

27:56.520 --> 27:57.880
Good morning.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.240
-Good morning.
-Hi.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.800
-Hi.
-How was last night?

28:00.880 --> 28:01.960
Last night?

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
-You know where I was last night?
-Yes, at Jenna's.

28:06.800 --> 28:10.480
You texted me to say you were staying
there to watch La La Land.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.000
-I did?
-Jenna is from a very wealthy family.

28:14.480 --> 28:17.880
Well, that's besides the point.
Her boyfriend is a mechanic.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.680
You're going to get on just great.

28:19.760 --> 28:20.600
Yeah, I'm sure.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.000
Thanks for introducing her
to your friends.

28:23.080 --> 28:25.280
You're welcome,
anything I can do to help.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.640
You're so sweet.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.920
And I'm glad
you've settled your differences.

28:32.680 --> 28:35.720
MOM, I WAS WRONG ABOUT NICK.
HE'S WONDERFUL

28:37.040 --> 28:39.520
Were there any boys your age?

28:39.600 --> 28:40.760
I don't need friends.

28:40.840 --> 28:43.480
You separated me from Dan,
but I won't forget him.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.880
-Sweetie...
-He's much better than all these snobs.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.680
Dan?

28:52.920 --> 28:56.360
Her boyfriend. She misses him,
she must've had a bad night.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.320
More pancakes?

29:00.080 --> 29:01.560
I'm good. Thanks, Petra.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.160
-Right here's fine.
-I'll get sunburned.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.240
UNKNOWN NUMBER

29:17.120 --> 29:17.960
Hello?

29:19.280 --> 29:20.200
Yes?

29:23.840 --> 29:25.520
-Watch out, Lion.
-So cool.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.640
I almost hit you.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.520
Hey, sis.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.000
Don't ever touch my phone again.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.080
Don't ruin one of my parties again.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.440
-La La Land?
-It suits you.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.040
I hate chick flicks.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.520
You're more into porn, right?
With that face...

29:45.080 --> 29:46.040
Leave her alone.

29:46.680 --> 29:50.000
-Just ignore them.
-It's fine. I can stick up for myself.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.320
Bro, you missed out
on the best part of the party.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.560
I know, man. I crashed.

29:55.640 --> 29:56.840
I stayed up reading.

29:58.280 --> 30:01.680
Hey, did you know that glass is a liquid?

30:01.760 --> 30:02.960
Crazy, right?

30:03.040 --> 30:05.800
-Are you shitting me?
-I'm serious.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.880
I swear. The windshields
you replace in the garage?

30:08.960 --> 30:10.440
Pure liquid. How about that?

30:10.520 --> 30:13.040
-What are you smoking, bro?
-Crystal.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.160
Mikel, tonight
we do need to do that paperwork.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.560
-What time should we meet?
-9:00 at my place?

30:19.640 --> 30:20.840
9:00? Okay.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.800
-We can order some pizza.
-Okay. Cool.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.680
Come help me with this.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.920
Nice ass, right?

30:35.680 --> 30:37.640
And now, like flies to honey...

30:37.720 --> 30:39.360
-Nick.
-What?

30:39.440 --> 30:42.320
-You didn't invite us to your party.
-I saw you there.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.000
Please, can we come to the race tonight?

30:46.920 --> 30:49.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.400
The weather is nice today, isn't it?

31:32.000 --> 31:34.600
Nick! Nick! Nick!

31:52.200 --> 31:53.400
Good luck, baby.

31:54.960 --> 31:57.480
Careful on the sixth turn, it's tricky.

31:57.560 --> 31:58.640
-Okay?
-Don't worry.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.760
That's it. Go, Nick!

32:01.960 --> 32:03.240
What's the matter?

32:05.720 --> 32:08.440
Are you afraid
you won't make it to the final?

32:08.520 --> 32:11.200
Don't worry, I'll beat you
like I do every year.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.280
Sure.

32:24.720 --> 32:25.680
Ready?

32:27.960 --> 32:28.800
Ready?

33:02.800 --> 33:04.160
Come on, Nick!

33:28.560 --> 33:31.320
Come on, that's it! Step on it!

33:46.680 --> 33:47.680
Noah!

33:48.400 --> 33:49.920
-Hey!
-What a surprise!

33:56.600 --> 33:59.240
Come on! Go!

34:02.680 --> 34:03.640
Come on!

34:07.960 --> 34:10.520
I don't know what's wrong.
He's not focused.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.520
Let's go!

34:18.600 --> 34:19.920
Come on, Nick!

34:20.679 --> 34:22.199
Problem's the sixth turn.

34:22.280 --> 34:25.360
He has to turn through the wide side
and hold off braking.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.760
How do you know that?

34:48.280 --> 34:49.840
No!

34:55.080 --> 34:56.080
Let's go!

35:01.560 --> 35:04.400
Yeah! Come on, dog!

35:04.480 --> 35:05.880
Come on!

35:05.960 --> 35:09.000
Nick! Nick! Nick! Nick!

35:09.760 --> 35:12.240
She's back for more.
Is she his girlfriend?

35:12.320 --> 35:14.760
Anna? His only girlfriend is that machine.

35:18.760 --> 35:19.960
Yeah!

35:22.200 --> 35:23.400
Fuck this shit.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.440
Amazing!

35:28.520 --> 35:29.400
IMAGE RECEIVED

35:31.520 --> 35:32.720
What is this crap?

35:34.240 --> 35:36.000
No, I can't believe this.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.280
-Your boyfriend?
-And my best friend!

35:38.360 --> 35:40.240
She's sucking his face right off.

35:41.280 --> 35:44.240
Fucking leech! God fucking damn it!

35:45.240 --> 35:47.560
-I can't believe this.
-Hey, come here.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.640
-Cry it out.
-No way.

35:49.720 --> 35:53.160
"Get drunk and make out with some guy"?
Or the other way around?

35:53.240 --> 35:54.800
Depends on how hot he is.

36:00.320 --> 36:01.360
Motherfucker.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.440
Come on!

36:24.920 --> 36:26.280
HEATS

36:47.640 --> 36:49.640
Come on!

36:57.600 --> 36:59.080
IMAGE RECEIVED

37:17.600 --> 37:19.720
FINAL RACE

37:32.920 --> 37:34.200
No, not like that.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.480
Look at the camera, okay? Now kiss me.

37:41.720 --> 37:45.560
Leonardo Daniel Ponce de la Rosa,
your ass is on my car.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.560
-Sorry, Nick.
-Beat it.

37:52.760 --> 37:55.160
Stop scaring away
everyone who comes near me.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.040
You're still drinking
everything people give you.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.880
So what?

37:59.960 --> 38:02.840
I won't take you home.
Especially if you're pregnant.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.400
-I just wanted a picture.
-A picture?

38:05.480 --> 38:09.240
-Yes. Kissing someone.
-Right. Trying to make Dan jealous?

38:09.320 --> 38:12.080
-What happened?
-None of your business.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.400
So that's what
you've been doing all night.

38:15.480 --> 38:20.160
Sorry I'm not as complicated as you,
racing cars to prove who has a bigger one.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.440
If I get you your picture,

38:34.680 --> 38:36.520
will you go home already?

38:38.440 --> 38:39.440
Maybe.

38:41.040 --> 38:41.960
Maybe?

39:15.280 --> 39:16.360
Tongue?

39:17.360 --> 39:18.280
Okay.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.200
There's your picture.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.120
Come on.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.080
Wait here.
I'll go get Jenna to take you home.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.320
Anyway, I'm going back to the party.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.360
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you all night.

40:09.400 --> 40:12.240
What are you doing?
Do we have time before the finale?

40:12.320 --> 40:13.600
Just a quick one.

40:18.880 --> 40:23.000
ONLY TOOK ME HALF AN HOUR TO FIND A GUY
MORE EXCITING THAN YOU. WE'RE DONE.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.120
There.

40:39.560 --> 40:40.480
So cool.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.800
Hi. It's clear you know a lot about cars.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.440
I've raced once or twice.

40:50.520 --> 40:54.160
-I thought it was your first time.
-I wish. But I'm not racing.

40:54.240 --> 40:56.800
No? Then why are you at the starting line?

41:05.280 --> 41:06.920
Already? So soon?

41:08.280 --> 41:12.080
No, hey, I...
You don't get it, I'm not racing, Nick is.

41:12.160 --> 41:13.880
So why the fuck isn't he here?

41:14.520 --> 41:15.680
Shit.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.240
Whoa, baby! Where are you going?

41:27.320 --> 41:29.120
If no one races, we win.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.080
I can tell you want to.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.680
Since you're a woman,
I'll give you a five-second head start.

41:39.560 --> 41:42.120
-What do you say?
-Five seconds?

41:47.360 --> 41:48.360
What's up, Nick?

41:49.240 --> 41:50.960
-What are you doing here?
-Ready?

41:51.040 --> 41:53.000
-Didn't you get my text?
-What text?

41:53.080 --> 41:54.040
Ready?

41:54.120 --> 41:56.680
But if you're here, then...

41:58.240 --> 41:59.440
You're shitting me.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.360
What? Why aren't they going?

42:13.120 --> 42:17.120
Hey! What are you doing?
I just gave you a head start.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.800
I know, I'm using it.

42:19.560 --> 42:23.960
When we reach the finish line,
I want people to know a woman beat you.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.440
What the fuck?

42:55.800 --> 42:56.920
Hey!

42:57.760 --> 42:58.880
What are you doing?

43:02.520 --> 43:03.920
What the hell, asshole?

43:15.680 --> 43:17.240
I like this girl.

43:22.720 --> 43:25.120
Come on!

43:39.080 --> 43:40.560
The sixth turn.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.360
She's not braking.
She'll run off the track.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.480
Yes! Take that!

44:25.280 --> 44:26.120
Fuck!

44:26.200 --> 44:27.240
What's he doing?

44:29.520 --> 44:31.240
What's he doing? He's crazy!

44:55.280 --> 44:57.560
Yeah!

44:57.640 --> 44:59.880
Yes! Yes!

45:11.320 --> 45:13.520
-Have you lost your mind?
-But I won.

45:13.600 --> 45:16.440
-You don't know what you've done.
-Damn cheaters!

45:18.600 --> 45:20.080
What happened, Leister?

45:20.160 --> 45:22.360
The finale was between you and me.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.600
You've totally disregarded the rules.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.120
-So we win.
-That's ridiculous.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.360
She's not in the gang. We'll race again.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.200
She is. She's wearing the bandana.

45:31.280 --> 45:34.000
You're the one who cheated
by ramming into me.

45:34.080 --> 45:36.400
And I still beat you, asshole. A woman.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.640
Look at me. A woman.

45:37.720 --> 45:39.880
-Shut up, will you?
-Sorry, Nick.

45:39.960 --> 45:42.800
Rules are rules. So pay up.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.400
I'm transferring the 15,000.

45:47.480 --> 45:51.120
-Nick, that's crazy.
-You just couldn't help yourself. Move.

45:51.200 --> 45:54.360
I'll pay you back,
even if it takes me years to save up.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.400
And the other thing?

45:56.480 --> 45:59.760
I know it's hard
to part ways with that beauty,

45:59.840 --> 46:01.600
but you don't have a choice.

46:06.720 --> 46:09.160
Nick? You can't give it to him.
Are you crazy?

46:09.240 --> 46:12.160
Don't worry,
I'll take you for a ride anytime.

46:12.240 --> 46:15.160
You're not going to enjoy it.
You know why?

46:15.240 --> 46:17.400
-No.
-Because I beat you good.

46:17.480 --> 46:20.440
Everyone'll remember that
when you're showing off in it.

46:21.520 --> 46:22.400
Nick.

46:23.240 --> 46:24.800
Please.

46:24.880 --> 46:27.880
Next time,
don't let that bitch out of the house.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.560
What are they doing?

46:56.000 --> 46:57.160
Rafaella!

47:06.440 --> 47:08.080
Push forward! Come on!

47:08.160 --> 47:09.680
What's wrong, girl? Let's go.

47:15.560 --> 47:17.800
Get in the car. Come on.

47:20.920 --> 47:21.920
Let's go, brother!

47:27.400 --> 47:28.240
Move!

47:29.960 --> 47:31.440
Drive!

47:40.680 --> 47:41.640
You.

47:45.120 --> 47:47.360
-Are they following us?
-I don't think so.

47:47.440 --> 47:48.720
Jenna, are you okay?

47:49.240 --> 47:52.360
-Answer me.
-Stop pestering me. I'm in shock.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.880
I worry if you don't talk.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.920
-Because you love me?
-Don't start.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.840
-Not even a little?
-Girl, quit nagging me.

47:58.920 --> 48:01.120
-God, you're lame.
-"You're lame."

48:10.040 --> 48:14.200
-Come on! Get up, you've slept enough.
-I don't feel well today either.

48:14.280 --> 48:17.200
Today is Will's company gala
and I need your help.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.720
UNKNOWN: SHOULD'VE KEPT
YOUR MOUTH SHUT, BITCH.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.040
Is that Dan?

48:22.840 --> 48:26.440
I didn't know that you were so close
to him and Betty. I'm sorry.

48:26.520 --> 48:28.840
-That doesn't matter now.
-It does.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.680
I don't want to see you like this.

48:30.760 --> 48:33.880
You'll end up mummified
with all that Egyptian cotton.

48:33.960 --> 48:37.720
Here's the plan: breakfast
at the beach club and then the hair salon.

48:37.800 --> 48:40.200
Which one?
Will and Nick will wear a tuxedo.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.120
Nick's here?

48:41.200 --> 48:42.680
He's been missing for 4 days,

48:42.760 --> 48:46.160
but he knows this gala's important
to his dad. He'll show.

48:50.120 --> 48:51.440
That hater again?

48:51.520 --> 48:54.120
It's got to be Ronnie, right?
Just block him.

48:54.680 --> 48:58.160
Yeah... I just got here
and everyone hates me already.

48:58.240 --> 48:59.960
Which one are you wearing?

49:16.920 --> 49:18.480
Hey, Will! Which one?

49:19.120 --> 49:20.840
Both are beautiful.

49:20.920 --> 49:23.720
I'll tell the designers,
but which one should I wear?

49:23.800 --> 49:25.400
We'll be late for rehearsal.

49:26.440 --> 49:27.960
I don't know. The black one.

49:28.040 --> 49:31.240
Important people will be there.
Judges, lawyers...

49:31.320 --> 49:34.560
-We can't leave this to chance.
-Relax, you'll look gorgeous.

49:34.640 --> 49:36.040
That's not the point.

49:37.760 --> 49:38.960
What's the matter?

49:40.800 --> 49:43.720
What are you worried about?
Not being good enough?

49:44.560 --> 49:45.640
Is that it?

49:46.840 --> 49:48.280
Look at me.

49:49.720 --> 49:52.640
You've been through
more important tests in your life.

49:52.720 --> 49:54.320
This will be child's play.

49:56.240 --> 49:58.160
I don't know what you saw in me.

49:59.320 --> 50:02.000
I remember you
walking through that cathedral,

50:02.080 --> 50:05.320
and describing its altarpieces
and its dome with such passion

50:05.400 --> 50:07.880
that it seemed
like you'd built it yourself.

50:07.960 --> 50:11.600
I'll have to show it to you again
because you never looked up.

50:12.160 --> 50:13.760
Tonight's going to be the same.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.960
I'm only going to have eyes for you.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.560
Hey. Listen to me.

50:19.880 --> 50:24.760
This family and all of its companies,
think of them as a huge cathedral.

50:25.400 --> 50:28.160
And you'll be
the perfect tour guide. Okay?

50:29.760 --> 50:31.800
-I love you.
-I love you too.

50:35.960 --> 50:37.600
Hurry up.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.840
I think I'll wear the pink one.

50:51.480 --> 50:54.440
Hey, you know Rodrigo
wants to be my boyfriend?

50:54.560 --> 50:56.360
The blond? What will you tell him?

50:56.480 --> 50:58.760
-No.
-Good girl!

50:58.840 --> 51:00.520
You'll only get heartbroken.

51:00.600 --> 51:03.800
Do what I do, sis,
run away before it's too late.

51:03.880 --> 51:07.160
I have two boyfriends already.
Why would I want three?

51:09.680 --> 51:10.800
My blood sugar.

51:13.120 --> 51:15.440
Come here, sweetie. There we go.

51:16.880 --> 51:20.520
Mommy's going traveling again,
will you come see me?

51:21.240 --> 51:22.120
I don't know.

51:22.200 --> 51:24.840
-When will she be back?
-She didn't say.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.760
What if she doesn't come back?

51:28.840 --> 51:30.520
What do you mean?

51:30.600 --> 51:33.240
What if she divorces my daddy
and abandons me?

51:33.320 --> 51:36.280
-That will never happen, honey.
-She did it to you.

51:37.640 --> 51:39.320
That was different, sweetie.

51:40.080 --> 51:43.600
I was a disastrous son,
an intolerable little devil.

51:43.680 --> 51:47.800
Unlike you. You're a little angel.
You're growing wings and everything.

51:51.400 --> 51:52.520
Hey, Maggie...

51:53.360 --> 51:55.040
I have to leave early today.

51:55.120 --> 51:57.720
No, why? Please don't go!

52:16.960 --> 52:18.000
Ma'am.

52:19.760 --> 52:20.760
Sir.

52:21.600 --> 52:24.080
Honey. Everything went great.

52:24.160 --> 52:25.000
Hello, Noah.

52:48.320 --> 52:49.680
STATUSES - NICK

53:21.600 --> 53:22.600
Thor.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.840
Those turns are impossible.

53:39.320 --> 53:40.360
They can be done.

53:41.920 --> 53:44.240
You just have to pull on the handbrake,

53:44.320 --> 53:48.640
and turn the steering wheel 20 degrees
to the right and 60 to the left.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.280
Twenty, sixty. Like a passcode.

53:53.160 --> 53:54.360
That's right.

53:56.120 --> 53:58.160
You stood Anna up at the gala.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.560
Where were you?

54:01.200 --> 54:03.040
With someone who needed me.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.960
I thought I was your only sister.

54:08.400 --> 54:10.680
-I'm sorry about...
-It doesn't matter.

54:10.760 --> 54:11.960
No, it does matter.

54:12.040 --> 54:15.200
-That car must be worth over...
-That doesn't matter.

54:51.640 --> 54:53.000
This isn't right.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.960
-No, it isn't right at all.
-No.

55:00.560 --> 55:02.960
You're my stepsister and you're 17.

55:03.040 --> 55:05.080
Then kiss me until I turn 18.

55:14.880 --> 55:16.560
Don't let me do this again.

55:17.520 --> 55:21.920
Wait, you get close to me
and I have to prevent it?

55:22.000 --> 55:24.280
I don't know what's happening to me.

55:25.680 --> 55:27.080
Nick, is that you?

55:30.520 --> 55:32.600
You think what you did today was okay?

55:32.680 --> 55:36.160
It wasn't just a gala,
we were introducing ourselves as a family.

55:36.240 --> 55:38.000
We can't give that impression.

55:38.080 --> 55:40.480
Your dad is upstairs.
You should talk to him.

55:40.560 --> 55:41.960
I'll go right now.

55:49.240 --> 55:52.160
And you? You didn't say a word all night.

55:53.560 --> 55:55.440
What am I going to do with you?

56:12.520 --> 56:15.720
-From racing driver to car washer.
-And tomorrow, waitress.

56:16.520 --> 56:19.960
-Want one?
-You shouldn't kill your last brain cell.

56:21.880 --> 56:23.320
Hey! Don't.

56:23.400 --> 56:26.200
We agreed you couldn't come
near me. Remember?

56:27.480 --> 56:29.000
But you can watch.

56:32.800 --> 56:34.200
Tequila?

56:46.880 --> 56:48.080
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hi.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.640
Why are you washing that beater?

56:53.840 --> 56:55.400
I have a surprise for you.

56:56.480 --> 56:59.240
-What, the car?
-No. The car's mine.

57:02.440 --> 57:03.480
Hi, Noah.

57:05.800 --> 57:06.800
Dan.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.320
What are you doing here?

57:13.120 --> 57:14.920
You can kiss, don't mind me.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.320
It's good to see you.

57:23.080 --> 57:26.320
I need to finish washing
the car, I was...

57:26.400 --> 57:27.440
Okay.

57:28.440 --> 57:32.040
-Come, I'll show you to your bedroom.
-Okay. See you in a bit.

57:43.640 --> 57:46.000
No! No, please, no.

57:46.080 --> 57:47.240
No!

57:49.120 --> 57:50.920
Nick! We've got a problem.

57:51.920 --> 57:54.840
-You're the one getting close now.
-No, it's just...

57:54.920 --> 57:59.200
-My boyfriend... I mean, my ex is here.
-You're the one with the problem then.

57:59.280 --> 58:04.800
-I sent him the picture of us kissing.
-Oh, right! That picture. Yes.

58:04.880 --> 58:05.720
So what?

58:05.800 --> 58:08.600
-If he recognizes you, he'll tell my mom.
-Noah?

58:09.960 --> 58:10.800
Noah.

58:12.080 --> 58:12.920
Excuse me.

58:16.640 --> 58:17.480
Noah.

58:17.560 --> 58:19.960
Can't believe you had
the cheek to come here.

58:20.040 --> 58:21.480
I came to say I'm sorry.

58:21.560 --> 58:23.520
-Sorry?
-Sorry.

58:24.520 --> 58:28.560
Betty didn't mean anything.
I missed you and she reminded me of you.

58:28.640 --> 58:31.520
You remind me of an orangutan,
but I didn't kiss one.

58:33.760 --> 58:36.760
Noah, I know.
I know I've been a real jerk.

58:36.840 --> 58:38.920
I deserve everything I have coming.

58:40.840 --> 58:41.680
Sorry, dude.

58:41.760 --> 58:44.360
-Pack your bags and leave, today.
-Fine.

58:44.440 --> 58:47.800
-But there are no flights until tomorrow.
-God damn you, Dan!

58:47.880 --> 58:49.520
Well, brother!

58:49.600 --> 58:52.560
You're soaked!
No worries, dude, come with me.

58:52.640 --> 58:54.800
-Are you stupid?
-That was fun, wasn't it?

58:54.880 --> 58:55.760
No.

58:57.880 --> 58:59.600
I'll help you dry off.

58:59.680 --> 59:01.320
Okay? Look.

59:06.280 --> 59:07.240
Asshole!

59:12.360 --> 59:13.640
What are you doing?

59:17.800 --> 59:19.480
Dan could see us.

59:29.800 --> 59:32.960
If our parents catch us,
it'll be game over.

59:33.040 --> 59:34.560
Is that what you want?

59:34.640 --> 59:37.040
No. You?

59:38.160 --> 59:39.080
No.

59:46.720 --> 59:48.200
Right... Let's see.

59:49.160 --> 59:50.000
Oh, God.

59:50.080 --> 59:53.080
It's fine, we'll dry you off,
we'll help you...

59:53.160 --> 59:58.200
-Sorry, who is that guy with Noah?
-That's her neighbor, Cayetano.

59:58.280 --> 59:59.560
Nicholas!

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:01.800
Coming!

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.360
That's right, Nicholas.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.560
Hey, wasn't that the guy from the picture?

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.760
-Surprise!
-Damn, Mom.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.320
Look what came for you.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.200
I'd say these flowers
smell like a reunion.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080
Thanks.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.320
-Honey, did something happen with Dan?
-No.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.840
I just didn't expect to see him so soon.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.080
It was some sort of emotional jet lag.
I'll be fine.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.720
Have you met someone else, maybe?

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.400
No, not at all.
Who would I have met?

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.680
Right.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.120
Well, he'll be on the same floor.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.080
Who?

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.040
Dan. I trust you'll behave
responsibly and show restraint.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.440
-All right, Mom. Get out of here.
-Okay, okay...

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.760
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.720
What the hell?

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.280
Why are you doing this?

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.720
-That's not mine.
-Please.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.920
I'm persistent, but not violent.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.600
Is it from Betty?
Does she know you're here?

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.840
Forget about Betty.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.560
Does your mom not suspect any of this?

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.880
-I don't know what you mean.
-Sure.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.240
Can we talk tonight over a drink?

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.720
Mallows? Who would send mallows as a gift?

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.440
I found you a cheap hotel nearby.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.320
You gave that Leister
a good beating, right?

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.960
Don't worry, the car won't be
the only thing I take from him.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.800
So what are you waiting for? Go get her.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.560
I thought you'd want to be here to see it.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.640
Call your buddies and let the party begin.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.520
-Bye, Nick. It's your loss.
-Some other time, girls.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.720
Hey, Nick!

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.000
What are you doing here?
Did your car break down?

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.160
If you need a ride someplace, really, I...

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.000
I want you to deliver
a message to your sister.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.800
Noah?

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.080
Nick!

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.320
-Are you okay?
-Just what I needed.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.680
I'm sorry. I thought you were Dan.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.640
I still would've hit you
if I'd thought it was you.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.320
-Did I do that to you?
-No, but you could've if you wanted to.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.360
No. Your nose is bleeding,
don't tilt your head backward.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.080
You need a cold compress.
Do you have painkillers?

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.400
You know about beatings as well as cars?

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.400
I'm perfect in many ways, honey.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.680
-Who did this?
-Never mind that.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.400
I swear that from now on,
I'm not fighting anymore.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.720
-It was Ronnie, wasn't it?
-That guy is crazy.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.360
He's after you.
You have to stop going out alone.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.440
-So do you.
-I'm serious.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.280
-So am I.
-Well, let's stop going out alone.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.360
Both of us.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.560
Not the most romantic way to say
you want to spend more time with me.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.760
Do you want to spend more time with me?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.840
I can't. Dan's still here.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.400
Do you still have feelings for him?

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.720
Does it hurt?

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:04.920
Quite a lot.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.880
What about here?

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.720
Or here?

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.040
What are you doing?

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:24.400
I need to check your sensitivity.
You could have a damaged nerve.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.760
The heat of your hands
won't help with the swelling.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.840
I can feel you're more swollen.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:59.400
-We're being bad again, Freckles.
-Do you want me to stop?

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.560
Are you sure you can resist?

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.880
Why do we girls
always get hooked on the bad boys?

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.080
You're cocky,

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.640
liars,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.440
and you're violent.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.760
You're wrong. I'm not like that.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.120
Noah?

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.600
Are you okay? I heard a bang and...

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.560
I heard a bang too,
but I got them all in the face.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.480
I'm fine, thanks.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.120
You wanted me to forgive you.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.280
Well, if you could
keep this to yourself, please...

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.120
Do it for me.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.160
-Come on, Petra.
-Hush!

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.200
-A little higher.
-Good morning.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.439
I cleaned the leaves out of the pool.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.479
-I'm sorry you slipped.
-It's not your fault, Morti.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.680
Martín.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.160
All done. Dan is on the plane.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.600
-You got a letter from school.
-Thanks.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.200
Looks like he didn't say anything.

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:41.120
Yeah.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.279
I'M GOING TO REALLY MAKE YOU SUFFER

01:08:57.319 --> 01:09:00.160
No spots left on the volleyball team?
That's too bad.

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:03.439
What's wrong?

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.640
Nothing.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.680
-I'll move.
-No, we're in a rush.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.080
Hi, Anna.

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.160
All here?

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.319
Noah, the race the other day was awesome.

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:52.600
-Where'd you learn to drive?
-I'd rather forget that night.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.680
Her dad was a rally driver.
She has a photo on Insta.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.760
Was he good? Is he still competing?

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.320
He died.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.440
He stepped too hard on the gas.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.800
-I'm sorry.
-What about you, Nick?

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.360
How did you get into this gang culture?

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.720
-I don't wanna talk about the past.
-Grew up without a mother

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.000
and ran away.
He wanted to be a rebel.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.680
-Enough, Anna.
-Daddy canceled his credit cards,

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.360
and in Mexico, he met Lion,
who taught him how to live dangerously.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.400
Then he hooked up with his bestie.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.400
You don't have a dark past, Anna?

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.760
No way. My life has been very boring.
Maybe if I'd met you sooner...

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.560
-She was the classic school bully.
-Screw you.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.800
Did you send anonymous notes
to the girls you didn't like?

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.640
She ripped their eyes straight out.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.240
So I need
to get to know you better, right?

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.320
-That was a long time ago.
-Wait.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.800
I have something for you.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.400
I owed you a car, right?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
It's perfect.
You can't sneak into this one.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:10.000
But seeing you in that uniform
was the best gift.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.200
I was going to get you a poetry book,
but I see that's not your thing.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:18.200
No! I don't want Anna
to rip my eyeballs out.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.720
This had never happened to me
with Anna or anyone else.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.000
It's the first time
I can't control myself.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.840
Mario is waiting for me.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.880
What does he want from you?

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.400
I just know he smiles when he sees me.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.440
Are you going to settle for a smile?

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.320
Until our faces hurt.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.480
That guy has no blood in his veins.
He can't give you what you need.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.720
What do I need?

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:01.120
You don't need kisses,
you need volcanic eruptions in your mouth.

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.640
You don't need caresses,

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.120
you need furrows
burying in deeply until you shiver.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.360
Vertigo-inducing whispers in your ear.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:35.120
You don't need pleasure, you need shivers.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.440
We didn't see a thing.

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.400
Well? Was that poetic enough?

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.720
We now have a car for the races.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.880
Added 100 horsepower to Jenna's car.

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.680
You can borrow it anytime.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.560
Dude, are you crazy?
Isn't she your stepsister?

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.960
-So?
-Isn't that like incest?

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.160
After that beating
and what you were doing to him,

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.680
he won't have any strength left to fight.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.360
Fight?

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.000
You guys don't settle
on going for a coffee or watching a movie.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.080
Hit him, Bruno!

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.560
Nick!

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.920
-Don't do this.
-It's okay. He won't even touch me.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.520
This is nonsense.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.280
-Isn't it exciting?
-Getting hurt excites you?

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.840
-Pain doesn't bother me.
-And your opponent?

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.600
Do you enjoy hurting others?

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.120
No, I just like to fight.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:14.880
Well, I don't get it.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.560
-It's a way to blow off steam.
-From what?

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.440
What trauma do you have
that's making you do this?

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.080
Leave him alone.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.160
I'm sick of you!

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.400
What the hell is this idiot's problem?

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.280
Are you going to let her
soften you up? Come on.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.200
Go, Nick!

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.880
Hey, Nick is fighting!

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.360
What is this shit? Did you know
it would be like this?

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.480
-Kind of.
-Just for fun. This is obscene.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.520
What if they beat up
a homeless person tomorrow?

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.520
Forget about all that, okay?
Because it's not worth it.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.760
-Go on, show him!
-You got him!

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.360
-Go on!
-Come on!

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.160
Nick! Nick! Nick!

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.160
I wanted to thank you
for asking me to come with you today.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.680
It made me very happy.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.480
Sorry it was such short notice...

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.280
I don't want this jerk
putting his hands on you again!

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.680
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.600
-Mario, I'm sorry.
-It's fine. I'm okay.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:30.000
Of course, I guessed
something was going on.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.960
Mario, you can't walk home.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.680
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.920
I don't know.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.360
I've never felt jealous of anyone before.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.320
You drive me crazy.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.600
So this is all you can offer me?

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.960
This can't ever happen again.

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.560
-I swear I won't do it again.
-No, nothing can happen between us.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.000
Ever again.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:04.280
What? Why? What's wrong?

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.440
-You're hurting me.
-Stop messing with my head.

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.720
-What's wrong with you?
-Don't you see?

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.560
-I'm scared.
-Scared of what?

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.120
Besides the dark, like a little girl.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.080
Of you.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.680
I can't have a violent person
in my life again.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.960
Everything okay, Noah?

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.240
Need a ride home?

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.000
Mario! Jenna's taking us home.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.520
Pick me up on the way!

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.440
I taught her the basics.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.040
The brake,
the gas pedal, the gear shift...

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.840
I'M VERY CLOSE NOW. CAN YOU FEEL
THE PAIN OF MY PRESENCE?

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.760
I need to tell you something about Noah.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:58.040
Did you know her dad tried to kill her?

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.240
-What?
-With a knife.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.640
He'd never touched her before.
Only Rafaella.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.000
-He hit Rafaella?
-That's right, son.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.560
There are people like that.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.360
Violence is their way
of blowing off steam.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.120
Why are you telling me this?

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.840
Rafaella is scared he'll come back
to try and hurt Noah.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.120
-Come back from the grave?
-The grave?

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.760
He was sent to prison.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:24.080
-Wasn't he dead?
-No. If only.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:27.640
His sentence was reduced.
He was released two weeks ago.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.600
We've asked Esteban to accompany Noah.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.080
But you know her. Noah with a driver...

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.960
So we thought that you could do it.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.760
Why do you think he wants to hurt her?

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:41.680
Because Noah's testimony
was key in convicting him.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.200
It's all here, take a look.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.440
That man is dangerous, Nick.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.280
-Does she know he's out?
-No.

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:52.680
-Rafaella didn't want to worry her.
-Why?

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.480
She's terrified of her father.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.160
Drink.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.240
Okay, ready?

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.840
That guy's all bark but no bite.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.000
Where are all the cool guys
who whisper you sweet things?

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.440
NICK - DECLINE

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.280
-Those guys don't exist.
-Yeah.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.480
I like you, girl.

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:55.920
See? Why can't they say "I love you"?

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.480
They say "I love you"
before sleeping with you,

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.520
-but what they mean is "I want you."
-Exactly!

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.520
Of course, then they cum
and go quiet. Mistake!

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.120
You have to say it after!

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.040
That's when it means something,
not before.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.880
That's so deep.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.760
Thanks.

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.240
Not even one?

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.480
Bro, liven up this party. It's depressing.

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:25.600
Leave it to me.
What's up? This looks like a funeral.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.720
Let's party like there's no tomorrow!

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.240
-What's up, bro?
-Lion, is Noah with you?

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.440
What's that? Hold on.
Hey! Turn the music down a notch! No...

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.560
Lion!

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:42.960
No...

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.240
Fuck!

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.400
You have to turn up in a pimped-out car,
but the party is indoors?

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.120
That's absurd.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.200
Since Nick isn't here, the fun is over.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.400
Shall we get out of here?

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:07.160
Such pretty flowers!

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.960
You see how you can't drive?

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.240
NICK - CALLING

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.280
Hey, Nick, can you come
to Mikel's to get Noah's car?

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.560
It's best if we take a taxi.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.760
Yeah, she's wasted.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.960
There's no way she's driving.

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.080
All right.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.160
Shit, brother, you're going to kill me!

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.080
Don't sneak up on me like that.
You scared me.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.800
You too?

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.800
-Are you okay, Freckles?
-I'm perfectly okay to drive.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.120
You don't need a license to drive these.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:55.160
All this bullshit
she's pulling is because of you.

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.440
Where's the handle?

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.880
I forgot my blazer.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.240
-I'll be right back.
-She's been out of control for two weeks.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:05.800
Don't you think it's time you apologized?

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.640
-You're a good friend.
-She's a snitch!

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.240
-What are you looking for?
-My blazer.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.280
It's in the closet.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.680
Anna!

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.240
Anna, no! Open the door, please!

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.280
Are you looking for the light switch?

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.520
Please, it's not fucking funny!

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.520
The door is jammed.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.200
Anna! Help, please!

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.160
Anna! Anna, open the door, please!

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.440
Nobody is going to let you out.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.240
What's the matter? Did you see a monster?

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.840
Where's your mother?

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.640
Where is your mother?

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.840
Anna, open up! Open up!

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.480
-What happened?
-He's in there.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.320
-There's no one there.
-You're the fucking monster!

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.520
Come on. Let's go.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.960
It was just a joke.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.800
Why did you tell me your dad was dead?

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.960
Because he is to me.
I hope he rots in jail.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.320
Please, don't go.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.680
Why do you make it
so hard for me to hate you?

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.000
I would do everything to you,
Noah, you know that.

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:29.160
But we won't do anything
until there's no fear left in your eyes.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.120
That's so sweet. So cute.

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.320
Hey, about your dad, I wanted...

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.000
Good morning, Freckles. Are you okay?

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.520
I thought you couldn't control yourself
when you're by my side.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.320
I should go before everyone wakes up.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.440
Yeah.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:26.960
Noah, have you seen...

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.720
Dad...

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.640
Listen, I... She just couldn't...

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:34.640
It's Maggie. She's in the hospital.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.880
Maggie? What happened?

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.840
I think you should go.

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.120
Maggie!

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.040
Nick!

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:59.200
-How are you, honey?
-Much better.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.160
-You gave us a real scare.
-I wanted to scare the nurse.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:08.000
I hid behind the drapes
and turned off the cell phone alarm.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.920
That alarm is horrible, right?

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.960
Don't ever do that again, okay?

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.680
Okay. Where is Mommy?

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.840
She'll be here soon, don't worry.

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.360
Is that Noah? She doesn't look that rude.

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.560
No, she's not. She's amazing
once you get to know her.

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.120
Good morning.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.880
Hello.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.680
Isn't he the best brother ever?

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.360
He is.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.160
Once you get to know him.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.240
But you'll always be his favorite.

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:50.400
The shock was critical,
but she's out of danger now.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.920
Thank God. Thank you, Doctor.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.880
Lucky the nurse was at home.

01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.560
She doesn't need a nurse.
She needs a mother.

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:05.160
For now, she should get some rest.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.120
We'll be home soon.

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.680
What are you doing?

01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.720
Are you kicking me out again?

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.360
All of this was my fault.

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:57.280
Instead of leaving you stranded that day,
I should've kissed you.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.440
If I'd known earlier about your dad...

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.160
It hurts me to see you're scared of me.
It hurts so much.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:14.600
But you know I'd never hurt you.
You know that.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.560
They know about us.
There's no time for apologies.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:22.560
If loving each other is a sin,
then yes, we're guilty.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.800
The guiltiest people in the world.
But your mom has to understand.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.600
No. I don't want to hurt her.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:32.200
What she's found with your dad is amazing.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.040
She deserves to have that.
We can't ruin it.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:39.200
No. I couldn't bear it
if these were our last kisses.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.520
These kisses will last forever.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.400
If this is going to be the last time,

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.200
why don't we make it our first, too?

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.320
Wait.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.720
You're not sure?

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:43.640
-I am.
-Yeah?

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.720
Just promise me we will never forget it.

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.160
How could you doubt it?

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.800
No!

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:29.240
-So he had no teeth?
-We were eight.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.960
What about your first kiss?

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.120
It was much later. I was nine.

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.960
Yeah, playing with Jenna. A chain game.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:41.720
I kissed someone who then kissed her,
and then she kissed me.

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.240
Who was that someone?

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.640
-Her hamster.
-No...

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.800
-Yes...
-That's awful.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:48.720
Yeah.

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.560
This was amazing.

01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.040
This was wonderful.

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:08.480
The sun will rise in less than an hour.

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:12.880
Let's run away. Let's escape together.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.200
That never works.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.800
Look how the Montagues
and Capulets ended up.

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.960
-It worked for Casanova.
-He didn't run away for love.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.400
He escaped from prison.

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.440
And didn't Blood Wedding end well?

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.680
-What are you doing?
-Making the most of our time.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.720
You're bad. So bad.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.160
-Why?
-Because I'm out of condoms.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.840
10.50 euros.

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.600
I just texted you. That was fast.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.760
-See how I'm the fastest?
-Nick!

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:10.800
Nick!

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.640
NOAH: I'M STILL ON FIRE

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:24.480
-Transaction denied.
-What?

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.400
Try this one.

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.320
Quickly, please, she's waiting for me.

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.920
Nick!

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:34.360
Bastard!

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.000
Now I'm going to give you
that ride in my car.

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.080
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.200
Noah!

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:55.400
Noah!

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.320
Fuck!

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.440
NATIONAL POLICE CORPS

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.400
Impossible. They're not distinguishable.

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:16.680
That's Ronnie.

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:19.440
I'd recognize that bastard's shadow
in a dark well.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:20.640
Are you sure?

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:23.960
Very well. We'll request a warrant.

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:25.720
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Detective.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.720
You're welcome.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.960
-I'm sorry. I should've told you...
-Leave me be, please. Just go.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.440
Nicholas.

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:45.120
If Noah gets out of this,
don't ever touch her again.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.720
The fights, the races...

01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:50.840
I should've realized
when you missed the gala.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.720
You promised me that was over.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.920
Are you really my son?
I don't recognize you.

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.040
They'll find her.

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.040
Fuck.

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:32.040
Fuck, Ronnie! You perverted motherfucker!

01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:34.880
I'll give you
a five-second head start to run away!

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.240
All this because I beat you in a car race.
You're crazy!

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.040
You beat him in a race?

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.440
-Dad.
-What a bastard, Ronnie.

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.480
He didn't tell me.

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.200
Well done.

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.280
That's my girl.

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.480
How was it?

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.960
Well, it doesn't matter.

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.920
I'm just glad
I taught you something useful.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.560
I wasn't such a bad father after all.

01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:17.240
Did you like the letters I sent you?

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.280
I'd never written to you before.

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.400
I don't know,
I felt like I owed it to you.

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:31.560
We found letters in her room.
They seem to be anonymous.

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.720
-Unknown number.
-Answer it.

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:44.840
Hello?

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.280
-Mom!
-Noah!

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.640
Mom!

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.320
I'm so disappointed in you, Rafaella.

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.520
Jonás, don't you dare hurt Noah.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:03.600
In all these years,
you never visited me once.

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:05.760
Not once.

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.120
Oh, Rafaella...

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:11.480
In jail, everyone dreams
of being a gold digger like you.

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.240
Don't talk to my wife that way!

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.520
"My wife," he says.

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.800
-What do you want?
-I don't know.

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:23.600
I see you all enjoying the things
that money can buy and I think,

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:27.040
"Shit, but I'm also part of the family."

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.480
-How much?
-A million.

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:33.800
-To which account number?
-By Bizum. Would that be okay?

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:37.360
Cash, non-sequential bills,
in a black, waterproof bag.

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.600
At the statue
on the promenade, at 4:00 p.m.

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.520
The two of you, and no police, of course.

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:48.040
Noah! Are you okay?

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:49.400
Nick!

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.920
Oh, brotherly love...

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:02.920
We've got something.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.760
Your ex-husband and Ronnie
were in jail together.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.440
They shared a cell.

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:15.480
If I don't call you in two hours,
something's wrong.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:18.040
Are you sure about this?
She's your daughter.

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.360
She beat you in a race?

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.720
-Yeah, well, she cheated.
-Right...

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.520
You'd like to get back at her?

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:30.400
-That's not on my mind right now.
-It's not on your mind. Right.

01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:55.960
Why is he taking so long?

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.400
Unbelievable!

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:07.000
You think this is one
of your illegal races?

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.440
I'm not going to stand by and do nothing.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:33.760
Don't worry, honey.
Everything is going to be okay.

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:39.920
He won't show up.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:41.720
Why do you say that?

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:46.440
He couldn't care less about the money.
He just wants to see Noah and me suffer.

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.880
Don't worry.

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:56.680
I don't like this.

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:02.160
Is it true you lost one of those in a bet?

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:05.880
The idea wasn't to lose it, ma'am.

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:09.520
Ronnie cheated. It still pisses me off
seeing him show off in it.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.440
Especially because
I'm still paying for the insurance.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:13.840
That's it!

01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.280
The insurance! The insurance's tracker!

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:21.200
Attention all units!

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.480
They found them.

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.040
This is it.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.520
LÓPEZ'S GARAGE

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.800
Okay.

01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.440
Noah.

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:03.240
Be informed, he's on the run
in a red sports car.

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:10.600
Unit two!

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:28.560
Okay. The roundabout.

01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:40.680
No! Stop!

01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:41.920
Get the fuck off me.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.680
-Are you okay? Noah!
-You?

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:51.320
Why do this?
Just take the money and go.

01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:56.480
You're engaging the clutch too soon.
Don't release until it starts to struggle.

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.200
Come on, faster!

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:34.040
That's it, good.

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:41.840
Good job.

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.320
Why did you do it?

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:48.080
Why weren't you like you
always were when we drove together?

01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.680
Like now, right?

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.400
-We were a team, I was happy.
-Shit, so was I.

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:54.120
What a great year, remember?

01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:57.720
Coming first overall... Two races away
from being world champion.

01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:00.880
Two easy races, and you both ruined it.

01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.080
World champion, Noah.

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:08.560
But no, to hell with the championship,
my career, everything.

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:14.840
Do you have any idea
what it's like to go for years, years

01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:17.600
without laying my hands
on a steering wheel?

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.920
Without a car,
my favorite thing in the world!

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.320
It's like not living, Noah!

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.960
Your lives should've ended too, like mine!

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.600
You shouldn't have come.
You killed us back then.

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.440
Doesn't look like it.
You seem happy, living the sweet life.

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.480
Get down!

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:40.440
No!

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:46.360
Shit.

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.800
End of the race.

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:53.880
What are you doing?

01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.040
Are you trying to kill us?

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.600
Does it matter? We're already dead.

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:51.360
Noah.

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.680
Thank you.

01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:06.000
Mom!

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.040
Noah!

01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:10.080
Sweetie!

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:12.680
Are you all right?

01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:14.320
Did he do anything to you?

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.000
Thank you.

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:05.840
Ma'am.

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:07.080
Come on in, Petra.

01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:31.360
Thank you for coming. I couldn't be alone.

01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:34.480
No one will ever hurt you again.

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:36.000
Ever.

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.280
I love you.

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.760
Wait, what did you say?

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:03.400
I said I love you.

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:07.840
-I can't believe it. Did Jenna tell you?
-What?

01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:10.760
-About saying "I love you" in this moment.
-No.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:14.080
Okay, it was Lion.

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:19.280
-But I would've told you anyway.
-I doubt it.

01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:21.840
Well, believe it.

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.520
Because it's true.

01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:42.920
So how long do we have to stay
in each other's arms now?

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:49.080
For a long time, I hope.

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:53.200
Because this is where our story begins.

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.160
Will, we need to do something.

01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:19.200
Anything, but this has to stop. Now.
