BUT FOURTH OR FIFTH COUSINS--
THAT WOULD BE FINE, RIGHT?

09:27.692 --> 09:30.486
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE GONNA HAVE KIDS.

09:30.569 --> 09:31.821
OOH, I WONDER IF HE WANTS KIDS.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.906
HE'D BE A GOOD DAD.

09:36.075 --> 09:39.161
- WELL, I HAVE A NEW CAUSE.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.497
HAS ANYONE HERE
HEARD OF CHIEF WAHOO?

09:41.580 --> 09:43.499
- YEAH, HE'S THE MASCOT
FOR THE CLEVELAND INDIANS.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.501
- THAT'S RIGHT,
AND HE'S OFFENSIVE,

09:45.584 --> 09:47.878
AND I AM GONNA HELP
GET RID OF HIM.

09:47.962 --> 09:51.340
- BUT HE'S THE SYMBOL
OF THE TEAM...

09:51.424 --> 09:54.719
WHICH HASN'T WON A SERIES
SINCE 1948.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.679
CAN HIM.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.682
- I FEEL SO FULFILLED,

09:59.765 --> 10:02.518
AND I OWE IT ALL
TO YOUR DNA TEST, MELANIE.

10:02.601 --> 10:05.813
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, I RESENTED YOU
STEALING MY TOOTHBRUSH,

10:05.896 --> 10:09.817
BUT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S
JUST HOW THE WHITE MAN OPERATES.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.363
- THAT'S IT!

10:14.447 --> 10:16.532
I'LL STEAL
MY COUSIN'S TOOTHBRUSH

10:16.615 --> 10:18.743
AND GET
A MORE DETAILED DNA TEST.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.494
I'LL JUST TELL HIM HE'S GOT,
LIKE, SPINACH IN HIS TEETH

10:20.578 --> 10:23.414
OR SOMETHING, AND THEN
AFTER HE BRUSHES, I'LL SWIPE IT.

10:23.497 --> 10:24.999
- IF YOU WEREN'T SEEING
A THERAPIST,

10:25.082 --> 10:27.626
I'D SAY YOU
SHOULD SEE A THERAPIST.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.670
- NO, I--
LOOK, IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,

10:29.754 --> 10:31.547
I'LL JUST GET OVER HIM
WITH A DIFFERENT SHRINK.

10:31.630 --> 10:32.923
A WOMAN.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.592
I CAN BE SURE
NOT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.597
- WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT US?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.182
- BECAUSE I'M TALKING TO YOU.
WHY ARE YOU ACTING SO WEIRD?

10:41.265 --> 10:43.601
- WE'RE NOT ACTING WEIRD.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.729
- YOU'RE THE ONE TRYING
TO GET INTO YOUR COUSIN'S PANTS.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.109
- YOU TWO ARE ACTING
A LITTLE WEIRD.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.028
WHAT DID THAT HISTORIAN
TELL YOU?

10:54.111 --> 10:57.239
- OH, YOU KNOW, NOTHING MUCH.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.368
OH, EXCEPT WE DO HAVE A RELATIVE
HERE IN OHIO.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.203
A YOUNG WOMAN
WHO LIVES IN AKRON.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.246
- OH, WELL, YOU GOT
TO GO MEET HER.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.247
I MEAN, COME ON.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.624
AREN'T YOU TWO CURIOUS?

11:09.710 --> 11:11.629
- CURIOUS?

11:11.712 --> 11:14.256
WHY DID YOU USE THAT WORD?

11:17.676 --> 11:19.261
- SO, EARLY IN RELATIONSHIPS,

11:19.345 --> 11:21.263
WHEN PEOPLE ONLY KNOW
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EACH OTHER,

11:21.347 --> 11:24.558
THEY FILL IN THE BLANK SPOTS
WITH WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.643
AS A PAINTER,
WHEN I LOOK AT A BLANK CANVAS--

11:25.726 --> 11:28.104
- YOU PAINT?

11:28.187 --> 11:30.147
- WELL, I MEAN, I DABBLE.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.568
- THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.278
WHAT CAN'T YOU DO?

11:36.362 --> 11:37.905
BESIDES BRUSH YOUR TEETH.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.448
- EXCUSE ME?

11:39.532 --> 11:42.284
- YOU HAVE A LITTLE SPINACH
RIGHT THERE.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.452
- OH, JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.
I'LL GO BRUSH.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.787
- OKAY.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.915
[toothbrush buzzing]

11:47.998 --> 11:49.959
DO YOU EVER PAINT NUDES?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.921
- HI. SORRY I'M LATE.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.131
IT WAS HARD TO GET IN.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.425
THERE'S A HUGE PROTEST OUTSIDE.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.217
- I KNOW.
THEY'RE PROTESTING YOU.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.176
- WHAT?

11:59.260 --> 12:00.636
WHAT DID I DO?

12:00.719 --> 12:02.680
- YOU'RE STANDING UP
FOR WHAT'S RIGHT.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.766
CHIEF WAHOO
IS AN OFFENSIVE STEREOTYPE,

12:05.850 --> 12:06.976
BUT SOME PEOPLE LOVE HIM.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.727
MOST PEOPLE, REALLY.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.605
- WAIT A MINUTE.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.649
YOU MEAN THERE ARE TWO SIDES
TO THIS ISSUE?

12:13.732 --> 12:14.650
NOBODY TOLD ME THAT.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.985
- OH, YEAH.

12:16.068 --> 12:16.986
SOME OF YOUR FANS
WILL HATE YOU FOR THIS.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.572
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE UP.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.824
- EVERYONE, PLEASE WELCOME
VICTORIA CHASE.

12:21.907 --> 12:25.327
[light applause]

12:25.411 --> 12:29.165
- AS A PROUD NATIVE AMERICAN,
I AM HERE TODAY

12:29.248 --> 12:32.126
TO TAKE A STAND ON THE ISSUE
OF THE MASCOT

12:32.209 --> 12:36.380
OF THE CLEVELAND INDIANS,
CHIEF WAHOO, WHO, SOME SAY,

12:36.464 --> 12:40.050
PORTRAYS A NEGATIVE IMAGE
OF NATIVE AMERICANS,

12:40.134 --> 12:42.011
AND OTHERS SAY THE OPPOSITE.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.012
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.013
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

12:44.096 --> 12:45.681
WAIT, WAIT.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.850
DOESN'T CHIEF WAHOO
OFFEND YOUR BELIEFS

12:47.933 --> 12:49.518
AS A PROUD NATIVE AMERICAN?

12:49.602 --> 12:52.062
- WELL, YES,
OF COURSE IT'S TERRIBLE,

12:52.146 --> 12:54.690
BUT WHEN YOU SEE
CHIEF WAHOO'S SMILE,

12:54.774 --> 12:57.568
I MEAN, HE IS SO CUTE,
YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE HIM HOME.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.155
AND SPANK HIM!

13:02.448 --> 13:03.824
TO CONCLUDE,

13:03.908 --> 13:07.536
HE IS OFFENSIVE AND ADORABLE.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.538
A RACIST CARTOON
WHO CAN ALSO INSPIRE.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.040
THANK YOU.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.876
- BUT, MS. CHASE,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN TAKING A STAND.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.879
- OKAY.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.757
I AM GONNA TAKE A STAND,

13:19.840 --> 13:22.551
BECAUSE THERE IS AN INJUSTICE
GOING ON HERE,

13:22.635 --> 13:25.763
AND THAT INJUSTICE IS PEOPLE
COMING TO ACTORS FOR AN OPINION.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.183
JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE BETTER-LOOKING THAN YOU

13:29.266 --> 13:30.518
DOESN'T MEAN WE KNOW STUFF.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.231
WHEN IS THE PUBLIC GOING
TO LEARN?

13:35.314 --> 13:37.900
LET MY PEOPLE GO.

13:37.983 --> 13:38.692
[mouths words]

13:41.320 --> 13:44.323
SO HOW DID I DO?

13:46.825 --> 13:49.411
- THE COUNCIL CONFERRED,
AND WE DON'T WANT

13:49.495 --> 13:50.454
TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.580
- WHAT?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.749
YOU'RE--YOU'RE VOTING ME OUT?

13:53.832 --> 13:56.669
- YES.
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.005
- WELCOME BACK.

14:00.089 --> 14:00.965
WE ARE HERE
WITH DR. CLIFTON LAIRD,

14:01.048 --> 14:03.509
PRESIDENT OF DNA QUEST,
ONE OF OUR SPONSORS.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.386
- PLEASURE TO BE HERE, MELANIE.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.054
AND AS WE SAY
IN THE DNA WORLD,

14:07.137 --> 14:09.098
DOUBLE THE HELIX,
DOUBLE THE FUN.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.058
- [laughs]

14:11.141 --> 14:12.851
YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF FUN,

14:12.935 --> 14:15.854
HERE'S A QUESTION I'M SURE
YOU GET ASKED A LOT:

14:15.938 --> 14:19.191
WHEN IS IT OKAY
FOR COUSINS TO DATE?

14:22.069 --> 14:25.281
- ACTUALLY, I DON'T GET ASKED
THAT QUESTION A LOT.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.283
- FOURTH COUSINS,
THIRD COUSINS?

14:27.366 --> 14:28.617
YOU KNOW,
SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING,

14:28.701 --> 14:30.619
WHERE'S THE CREEPY LINE?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.413
- I--I DON'T KNOW,

14:32.496 --> 14:35.165
UH, BUT I DO KNOW THAT
WE'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

14:35.249 --> 14:39.837
WE TESTED YOUR DNA, AND WE
DISCOVERED YOU HAVE A RELATIVE

14:39.920 --> 14:41.422
WHOM YOU'VE NEVER MET
LIVING RIGHT HERE

14:41.505 --> 14:42.506
IN THE CLEVELAND AREA.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.967
HIS NAME IS DR. MARK ANGELO,

14:45.050 --> 14:46.927
AND HE'LL BE JOINING US
IN THE STUDIO RIGHT NOW.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.262
- WHAT? NO.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.556
OH, NO!
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.019
- KESHA?

14:55.102 --> 14:57.855
- ACTUALLY, IT'S PRONOUNCED
"MELANIE."

15:02.693 --> 15:07.114
- LISTENERS, I MUST TELL YOU,
IT IS SO SURPRISING

15:07.197 --> 15:13.704
TO MEET A RELATIVE THAT
I HAVE NEVER, EVER SEEN BEFORE.

15:13.787 --> 15:16.081
- YES.
I'M SURPRISED BY THIS TOO.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.169
- YEAH, I WONDER IF WE HAVE
THE SAME FAMILY TRAITS.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.839
YOU KNOW, LIKE IN MY FAMILY,
WE SOMETIMES DO STRANGE THINGS

15:23.922 --> 15:26.550
THAT HAVE
PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATIONS.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.345
- WELL, IN MY FAMILY,

15:29.428 --> 15:31.513
WHEN SOMEONE TELLS US
WHO THEY ARE, WE BELIEVE THEM.

15:32.973 --> 15:36.393
- IN MY FAMILY, WE OPEN PRESENTS
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

15:39.104 --> 15:42.858
- WHICH REMINDS US
THAT IT IS NEVER TOO EARLY

15:42.941 --> 15:46.362
TO GIVE THE GIFT OF FORGIVENESS

15:46.445 --> 15:49.239
WHEN SOMEONE SAYS,

15:49.323 --> 15:53.535
"I AM SO, SO SORRY."

15:53.619 --> 15:56.413
[toothbrush buzzing]

15:56.497 --> 15:57.581
- SOMETHING'S BUZZING.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.707
- YEAH, IT'S NOTHING.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.250
- IS THAT
AN ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH?

16:00.334 --> 16:03.379
- I DON'T HAVE AN ELECTRIC
TOOTHBRUSH IN MY PURSE.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.880
THAT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING.

16:04.963 --> 16:07.549
NO, WHAT IT IS,
IS I'M A SINGLE WOMAN,

16:07.633 --> 16:09.385
AND SOMETIMES AT WORK
I GET TENSE.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.053
- OH, IT'S A VIBRATOR.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.723
- CAN WE JUST PLEASE
GO TO COMMERCIAL?

16:18.143 --> 16:20.396
OKAY, I'M JUST--I'M JUST GONNA
COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.731
[chuckles]
I'M NOT KESHA.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.733
- I GATHERED THAT.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.444
- AND IT'S NOT A VIBRATOR
IN MY PURSE.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.904
IT IS AN ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH.

16:28.987 --> 16:29.905
- WHAT DO YOU DO
ABOUT THE TENS--

16:29.988 --> 16:30.948
- I JUST HOLD IT IN!

16:33.158 --> 16:37.204
IT'S YOUR TOOTHBRUSH,
AND I STOLE IT BECAUSE I WANTED

16:37.287 --> 16:40.582
TO TEST YOUR DNA FURTHER TO FIND
OUT HOW CLOSELY RELATED WE ARE

16:40.666 --> 16:43.127
BECAUSE I HAVE
A LITTLE CRUSH ON YOU.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.922
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE
TO USE THE WORD "CRAZY"--

16:47.005 --> 16:49.800
- NO, NO, IN THIS CASE, "CRAZY"
SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFECT WORD.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.602
- THIS IS SO WEIRD.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.938
WE'RE GONNA MEET SOMEONE
WITH OUR DNA.

17:03.021 --> 17:04.940
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE MEETING
OUR CHILD.

17:05.022 --> 17:06.900
- THE ONLY THING I KNOW
IS HER NAME,

17:06.983 --> 17:08.736
SO I'LL HAVE TO USE
MY DETECTIVE SKILLS

17:08.819 --> 17:10.112
TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE
IS JESSICA.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.488
- HEY, JESSICA!

17:13.365 --> 17:14.616
- THAT'S HER!

17:16.326 --> 17:18.078
SHE'S COMING OVER.
ACT NORMAL.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.079
HI!

17:20.164 --> 17:21.832
- HI!

17:21.915 --> 17:23.459
- HI.
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

17:23.541 --> 17:24.917
- TWO BEERS, PLEASE.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.295
- GOT IT.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.922
- SO, JESSICA,
HOW LONG HAVE YOU WORKED HERE?

17:29.006 --> 17:29.965
- OH, NOT LONG.

17:30.048 --> 17:31.300
I'M ONLY WAITING TABLES

17:31.383 --> 17:32.342
TO PUT MYSELF
THROUGH VETERINARY SCHOOL.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.471
- OH, WHAT A WONDERFUL CHILD.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.848
- AND WHAT
A BEAUTIFUL ENGAGEMENT RING.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.224
CONGRATULATIONS.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.893
- THANKS.

17:40.976 --> 17:41.560
YOU KNOW, I'M ALWAYS
A LITTLE SELF-CONSCIOUS

17:41.643 --> 17:43.562
BECAUSE MY HANDS ARE SO BIG.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.483
- I THINK THEY'RE PERFECT.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.735
- I THINK YOU'RE PERFECT.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.404
- YEAH.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.156
OKAY, I'LL GET YOUR DRINKS.

17:56.742 --> 17:57.993
- WE DID GOOD, JOY.

17:58.076 --> 17:59.745
- WE REALLY DID.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.336
THANK YOU.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.338
- JESSICA, YOU'RE LATE.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.839
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.382
SHUT UP.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.511
- WHAT IF SHE'S OUR JESSICA?

18:15.594 --> 18:18.138
- OH, SHE IS NOT OUR JESSICA.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.726
- RIGHT, THE SWEET ANIMAL LOVER
IS OURS.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.853
WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON
WITH THAT MESS.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.605
- I'LL DRINK TO THAT.
- MM.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.199
- WE NEVER SAW THAT.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.951
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.250
- WELL, THE PRESS CONFERENCE
WASN'T A COMPLETE DISASTER.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.961
I'M REALLY PROUD
OF MY NEWFOUND HERITAGE,

18:49.044 --> 18:53.507
AND I ALMOST STOOD UP FOR
SOMETHING, AND THAT FEELS GOOD.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.218
- AND ELKA AND I HAVE ADJUSTED
TO BEING BLOOD RELATIVES.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.553
- [laughs]

18:57.636 --> 18:59.847
IT'S CHANGED
THE WAY I LOOK AT JOY.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.181
- OH, THAT'S SWEET.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.268
- NOW I SEE HER
AS AN ORGAN FARM.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.066
[doorbell rings]

19:11.149 --> 19:13.277
- I'LL GET IT.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.283
HI, DR. ANGELO.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.742
- HI.

19:20.826 --> 19:21.827
CAN WE TALK?

19:21.910 --> 19:23.412
- SURE. SURE.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.250
- EARLIER, YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO KNOW

19:28.333 --> 19:30.210
HOW CLOSELY RELATED WE WERE,

19:30.294 --> 19:32.087
SO I HAD A FRIEND
AT THE UNIVERSITY TEST MY DNA.

19:32.170 --> 19:33.755
- AND?

19:33.839 --> 19:34.631
- WE'RE TWINS.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.633
- WHAT?

19:36.717 --> 19:38.719
- I'M KIDDING.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.721
WOW, YOU ARE GULLIBLE.

19:40.804 --> 19:41.889
- [laughs]

19:41.972 --> 19:43.098
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.434
- SO TURNS OUT
YOU AND I ONLY SHARE

19:45.517 --> 19:47.227
ONE ANCESTOR
FROM THE 17TH CENTURY,

19:47.311 --> 19:49.938
SO WE ARE
VERY DISTANT RELATIVES.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.608
- GOOD TO KNOW.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.444
CAN I ASK WHAT MADE YOU
DO THE TEST?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.905
- WELL, I WOULDN'T LET MYSELF
THINK ABOUT YOU

19:57.988 --> 19:59.573
UNTIL I KNEW THE TRUTH.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.658
HONESTLY, YOU WEREN'T
THE ONLY INAPPROPRIATE ONE.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.577
- REALLY?

20:03.660 --> 20:05.579
- YOU WERE SO PRETTY
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU,

20:05.662 --> 20:07.247
I HOPED YOU WEREN'T MY PATIENT.
- [giggling]

20:07.331 --> 20:09.625
- THEN I SHOWED OFF
WITH MY GUITAR.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.669
I EVEN CALLED MY THERAPIST
ABOUT ASKING YOU OUT.

20:12.753 --> 20:13.670
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

20:13.754 --> 20:14.880
- HE ADVISED AGAINST IT.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.342
- OH.

20:18.425 --> 20:21.428
- I DON'T ALWAYS LISTEN
TO MY DAD--I MEAN MY THERAPIST.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.971
- [laughs]

20:23.055 --> 20:25.807
- I MAY HAVE ISSUES TOO.
- [laughs]

20:25.891 --> 20:29.144
SO ARE YOU ASKING ME OUT?

20:29.227 --> 20:32.105
- I'M ASKING YOU TO MARRY ME.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.982
- WHAT?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.735
OH, I REALLY AM GULLIBLE,
AREN'T I?
