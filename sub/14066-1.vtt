00:18.760 --> 00:19.920
Let me tell you something.

00:19.960 --> 00:23.000
You two women couldn't be more
beautiful if you were paid for.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.920
–Denny.
–What?

00:25.440 --> 00:27.420
God, you're sexy.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.330
Marry me.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.550
How about a dance instead?

00:30.590 --> 00:32.320
Then we can get married.

00:32.340 --> 00:34.518
The alimony check is already cut.

00:35.540 --> 00:38.048
He's certainly in his element tonight.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.270
Are you?

00:41.300 --> 00:43.880
I could be, with proper coaxing.

00:45.470 --> 00:47.360
You know what I'd really like to do?

00:47.400 --> 00:48.870
Tell me.

00:48.900 --> 00:54.000
I would like you to take me
home and ravage me,

00:54.030 --> 00:55.630
leaving me weak…

00:55.660 --> 00:57.640
gasping for breath…

00:58.330 --> 00:59.890
and pregnant.

01:01.650 --> 01:03.650
what was that last part?

01:05.129 --> 01:07.010
I want to have a baby.

01:07.030 --> 01:08.760
Yours.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.150
You live here?

01:12.180 --> 01:14.080
No, no, no, don't be silly.

01:14.110 --> 01:15.930
I have a big home in the 'burbs.

01:15.970 --> 01:18.820
I just use this place in the city for quickies.

01:18.860 --> 01:20.200
You make it sound so romantic.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.078
Oh, we're so right
for each other, Cynthia.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.030
I can feel it.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.590
You're hot.
I'm in heat.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.540
We're a match…

01:30.570 --> 01:32.830
waiting to ignite.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.820
Oh, Denny.

01:35.980 --> 01:41.130
I have a career and my career
is very important to me.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.200
–What do you do?
–Men.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.180
Rich men.

01:45.210 --> 01:46.840
Now don't get me wrong,

01:46.880 --> 01:50.590
I went out with you because
I find you funny and attractive,

01:50.630 --> 01:53.130
and I'm a huge sucker for power.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.820
But…

01:54.850 --> 01:56.970
if you want to have sex,

01:57.010 --> 02:01.040
it'll cost you $5,000.
–$5,000?

02:01.070 --> 02:07.440
What if you stayed a power sucker…
inside the car?

02:07.470 --> 02:09.759
$2,500.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.860
Here's $3,000.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.580
You are so sweet.

02:19.090 --> 02:20.310
Does that cost extra?

02:20.350 --> 02:22.950
You're under arrest for violation
of Massachusetts general laws,

02:22.990 --> 02:26.780
chapter 272, section 53a—
sexual conduct for a fee.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.690
You have the right to remain silent.
–Oh, come on.

02:28.730 --> 02:30.070
If you give up that right to remain silent,

02:30.110 --> 02:32.370
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

02:32.410 --> 02:34.720
You have the right to speak to an attorney
and have him present for questioning.

02:34.760 --> 02:35.560
I even liked you.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.720
–If you so desire and can't afford one…
–Change of plans, Jeffrey.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.670
Take me to jail.

02:42.070 --> 02:43.870
Here we go again.

03:06.210 --> 03:11.840
Boston Legal
Season 4 Episode 1

03:13.580 --> 03:16.520
I can't believe she was
an undercover cop.

03:16.550 --> 03:18.950
I should've known something was up
when she called me handsome.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.630
Did you actually give her money?

03:20.670 --> 03:22.270
Yeah.
It's entrapment, man.

03:22.310 --> 03:23.870
You saw the way she was dressed.

03:23.910 --> 03:27.170
My bet, I was targeted.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.740
–Alan, Denny.
–Shirley.

03:30.770 --> 03:32.520
Let me introduce Katie Lloyd.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.520
She's joining us today.
She's fresh out of law school.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.150
Very fresh.

03:36.180 --> 03:38.540
That took all of one second.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.920
Perhaps we can get
a cup of coffee later?

03:40.960 --> 03:42.260
That took five seconds.

03:42.300 --> 03:45.890
Well, well, well, Denny Crane.

03:48.580 --> 03:49.880
What are you doing in my law firm?

03:49.920 --> 03:53.140
It's not your firm, Denny.
I'm a senior partner. Remember?

03:53.180 --> 03:55.080
Or has your brain shrunk
since we last met?

03:55.120 --> 03:58.660
At that time, I believe
it was the size of a pea.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.200
I see you've made a friend.
–We had a deal, Sack.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.270
I stay out of New York…

04:03.290 --> 04:05.940
you steer clear of Boston.

04:05.960 --> 04:09.450
What's he doing here?
–New sheriff in town, Denny.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.830
Here…
let me help you get settled.

04:10.870 --> 04:12.090
What do you mean, “new sheriff”?

04:12.130 --> 04:15.290
I'm the sheriff!
You've seen my spurs.

04:16.079 --> 04:18.220
Hello.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.920
Hello.

04:19.940 --> 04:22.089
We'll talk about this later.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.280
We'll talk about it now.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.770
Okay, fine.
Go to my office then.

04:24.810 --> 04:25.760
Fine.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.430
Where is it?

04:27.460 --> 04:29.780
–Very peppy here.
–Yes.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.400
Uh, we apologize for any
temporary inconvenience,

04:32.440 --> 04:36.928
but until the renovations are complete,
you'll be sharing an office.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.300
Uh, Jerry Espenson, this is Katie Lloyd.

04:46.660 --> 04:47.910
Nice to meet you, Jerry.

04:47.950 --> 04:51.000
Hello.
Welcome. Hello.

04:51.020 --> 04:54.630
Jerry graciously volunteered
to share his office.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.770
Well, I'll let you get settled.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.890
I believe we have a staff meeting
scheduled for 11:00.

04:59.930 --> 05:01.210
Brilliant.

05:05.610 --> 05:07.220
Oh!

05:07.240 --> 05:09.320
Well, I should perhaps get organized.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.840
Yes.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.890
Yes.

05:13.460 --> 05:15.100
Oh, yes.

05:19.460 --> 05:21.080
You're pretty.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.650
Oh, you're very kind to say so.

05:23.670 --> 05:25.600
And you seem so nice.

05:25.630 --> 05:27.610
Thank you for that as well.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.760
I'm not being forward.
Don't be alarmed.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.160
It's just…

05:31.180 --> 05:33.880
not all litigators are nice people.

05:33.900 --> 05:37.320
Denise Bauer is nice,
but she's on maternity.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.100
Brad Chase was nice.
Now he's gone.

05:39.140 --> 05:41.940
I was beginning to think nice people
don't last long around here.

05:41.980 --> 05:44.650
So I'm so happy to see another one arrive.

05:44.690 --> 05:46.590
This was just assigned to us by the court.

05:46.630 --> 05:51.712
Indigent client, old lawyer jumped in front
of a bus, now he needs a new one.

06:00.650 --> 06:02.530
What is it?

06:03.100 --> 06:06.310
It appears to be a strangulation.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.290
I have a murder trial.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.670
Any advice as to what I should do first?

06:29.710 --> 06:32.560
Well, I suppose you should
first meet with the client.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.800
He didn't sound very pleasant
as the police report read.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.990
–No, he didn't.
–Can't say I want to meet him.

06:38.010 --> 06:40.030
Arrested for what?

06:40.050 --> 06:42.660
Ah, it was a conflict of interest.

06:42.680 --> 06:46.630
I was involved with this cop who
was working on a case that I was…

06:46.670 --> 06:48.790
involved with.
–Oh, dear God.

06:48.820 --> 06:50.160
Alan will take care of it.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.580
No, he will not.
I need Alan.

06:52.610 --> 06:54.690
I'll get you somebody else.
–I don't want anybody else.

06:54.730 --> 06:56.730
I don't care.
I need Alan.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.860
Now please leave, and try not to
get arrested on your way out.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.860
You said we'd talk about Carl Sack.

07:01.900 --> 07:05.570
I lied.
Out. Now.

07:10.470 --> 07:12.990
I did tell Denny I'd help him.

07:14.030 --> 07:17.090
Here's the deal— I'm rich.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.050
I soothe my guilt by making
various donations,

07:20.090 --> 07:24.010
most recently one to Stanford
to the tune of $3 million.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.830
I rescinded, and they're suing me.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.510
You're being sued by Stanford.

07:27.550 --> 07:32.600
My donation was earmarked to develop
technologies to combat greenhouse gas emissions.

07:32.640 --> 07:37.050
I've since learned Exxon-Mobil
also made a contribution— $100 million.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.850
Afraid the study's been bought?

07:38.890 --> 07:40.930
I'm not giving them my money.

07:40.940 --> 07:43.760
–So he's in charge of litigation?
–Apparently.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.990
–What about Shirley?
–Evidently, she didn't want to.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.520
Is he gonna reshuffle everything?
I hear he's a reshuffler.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.330
Here he comes.

07:51.310 --> 07:52.710
–Hello.
–Hello.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.280
Uh, hello.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.610
What's with the shifty eyes, son?

07:57.640 --> 07:59.880
That wasn't nice.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.710
Sorry.
I didn't mean anything.

08:03.730 --> 08:08.120
Truth is, my favorite uncle
had eyes exactly like yours.

08:08.140 --> 08:11.430
He liked to touch small children
in bad places.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.680
Do you like that, son?

08:24.780 --> 08:27.560
–He jumped in front of a bus?
–Evidently.

08:27.580 --> 08:29.970
Is there anything you can
tell me about my client?

08:30.010 --> 08:32.070
Well, you won't like him.

08:32.090 --> 08:34.620
He's cuffed and shackled,
so you're okay.

08:34.659 --> 08:36.169
We'll keep the other guard
in the corner.

08:36.210 --> 08:39.760
–I appreciate that.
–If you need anything…

08:52.610 --> 08:54.820
Hello, Mr Washington.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.150
My name's Katie Lloyd.

08:58.180 --> 09:01.490
I'll be filling in for Mr Rice,

09:01.520 --> 09:05.840
who, uh, suddenly and tragically
passed away this week.

09:06.550 --> 09:09.400
I'll be needing to be brought up
to speed somewhat and,

09:09.440 --> 09:13.340
as such, shall be seeking
a continuance.

09:13.780 --> 09:16.890
I anticipate being successful
in that endeavor,

09:16.920 --> 09:21.936
but in the meantime, I'd like to ask you
a few questions, if you don't mind.

09:24.970 --> 09:26.950
Lovely.

09:29.350 --> 09:32.760
I expect there's more
where that came from.

09:37.890 --> 09:41.940
You know… I rescued
a dog once from a shelter.

09:41.970 --> 09:47.030
He bit me six times before
we went on to be fab friends.

09:53.900 --> 09:57.570
–You asked to see me?
–Clarence. Yes, please. Come in.

09:58.710 --> 10:01.050
I feel as though we got off on…

10:01.080 --> 10:02.930
a wrong note.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.540
Do you have any hobbies, son?

10:06.120 --> 10:07.780
I'm not sure what you mean.

10:07.820 --> 10:09.860
Well, some people golf.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.360
Others go fishing.
Personally…

10:12.810 --> 10:17.480
I like to google myself
in the privacy of my own home.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.880
Do you ever google yourself, son,

10:19.910 --> 10:22.620
you know, in those hard-to-reach places?

10:22.640 --> 10:27.280
I still don't know what you mean,
and I'm finding you to be not very nice.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.710
I never forget a face, Clarence.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.120
And when I saw yours this morning…

10:32.140 --> 10:36.220
you know, sometimes, in addition
to googling myself, I like to go on YouTube.

10:36.260 --> 10:40.640
One of the current favorites is titled
“the dancing drag queen.”

10:52.580 --> 10:56.330
My favorite part…
is coming up right here.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.720
Now…

11:03.240 --> 11:05.620
I realize I'm new here, son…

11:05.650 --> 11:08.590
My friend Doris and me
entered a contest.

11:08.610 --> 11:10.790
It's at King's Row Kenmore.

11:10.810 --> 11:12.190
We've made the quarterfinals.

11:12.230 --> 11:13.940
I see.

11:13.970 --> 11:16.150
And the dress?

11:16.180 --> 11:18.200
It's just…

11:18.220 --> 11:20.850
something I do sometimes.

11:20.870 --> 11:22.250
Clarence…

11:22.270 --> 11:26.920
it wasn't my intent to come in here
and start barking directives,

11:26.950 --> 11:30.250
but I'm going to need you
to withdraw from…

11:30.270 --> 11:32.630
this competition.

11:33.650 --> 11:35.110
What— what do you mean?

11:35.150 --> 11:37.720
Son, we are in the business of law here.

11:37.760 --> 11:44.830
A law firm has to be discreet,
conservative, reasonable… modest.

11:44.870 --> 11:48.380
You're listed as a part-time
lawyer at Crane, Poole & Schmidt,

11:48.420 --> 11:52.120
and we simply cannot have that…

11:55.400 --> 11:58.040
associated with what we are.

11:58.070 --> 11:59.630
But…

11:59.830 --> 12:01.230
we're in the quarterfinals.

12:01.270 --> 12:06.550
Yeah, but, Clarence, Boston is
a very small town. I'm sorry.

12:07.390 --> 12:10.360
And if I refuse to withdraw?

12:11.630 --> 12:12.950
You know, son…

12:13.630 --> 12:17.660
I'm really hoping
people don't test me.

12:26.510 --> 12:27.450
Alan.

12:27.460 --> 12:28.870
Shirley.

12:31.700 --> 12:32.720
Lorraine.

12:32.730 --> 12:36.030
I suppose it was inevitable
we'd finally bump heads a bit.

12:36.070 --> 12:39.106
You really should keep
your promises, Shirley.

12:39.330 --> 12:41.780
Are you representing Stanford?

12:41.790 --> 12:44.750
It's discourteous not
to extend a greeting.

12:45.120 --> 12:48.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
distracted by your…

12:48.890 --> 12:50.330
neck.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.140
Will you relax?

12:52.150 --> 12:53.750
Don't tell me to relax, Denny.

12:53.790 --> 12:59.010
Telling somebody in an agitated
state to relax is like telling
a starving man not to be hungry.

12:59.050 --> 13:01.300
She's an old girlfriend.
The town is full of them.

13:01.340 --> 13:03.080
Not like her.

13:03.090 --> 13:05.970
She has a neck it's long.

13:05.980 --> 13:09.480
And she has eyes and… this neck.

13:09.490 --> 13:11.400
Two necks?

13:12.170 --> 13:13.180
Denny…

13:13.190 --> 13:14.740
I had…

13:16.220 --> 13:18.890
there is something
addictive about this woman,

13:18.930 --> 13:22.320
and not, uh, necessarily
in a healthy way.

13:22.330 --> 13:26.224
–I would, uh, lose myself around her––
–Hey, hey, hey, hey.

13:26.510 --> 13:28.070
Listen to me.

13:28.860 --> 13:29.620
We're friends, right?

13:29.660 --> 13:32.650
I-I-I-I-I would do anything
to help you with your problems,

13:32.690 --> 13:35.830
the same as you would do
whatever to help me with mine.

13:35.870 --> 13:37.580
True?
–Yes.

13:38.010 --> 13:40.530
I need you to get Gloria
to make my arrest go away.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.230
And just like that,
we're on to your problem.

13:42.270 --> 13:45.520
Alan, please. I could face jail.

13:45.530 --> 13:47.780
Why are you out with
hookers in the first place?

13:47.820 --> 13:50.080
Sex. What'd you think, cribbage?

13:50.090 --> 13:54.190
Don't you find it a little
desperate, Denny? A little sad?

13:54.200 --> 14:00.270
Let's face it— I'm not an attractive man, and
at my point in life, my options are limited.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.260
Denny, you're very
attractive. Are you kidding?

14:03.300 --> 14:04.890
Your face is…

14:04.900 --> 14:07.320
robust, it has character.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.670
You've got that twinkle in your eyes.

14:09.710 --> 14:12.250
You're surprisingly firm.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.130
You really think I'm attractive?

14:14.170 --> 14:15.970
I do. You know I do.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.840
May I cut in?

14:18.470 --> 14:19.680
No, you may not.

14:19.690 --> 14:23.230
Denny— you still do
answer to your name, right?

14:25.010 --> 14:26.030
Yes, I do.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.360
And I still run this place.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.290
No, you don't. What's
more, you don't want to.

14:30.330 --> 14:33.390
You just want to run around, drop
your pants, shoot people, date a hooker.

14:33.430 --> 14:35.450
How's the mad cow coming?

14:35.460 --> 14:39.400
Let's all pause while
you compose a comeback.

14:41.650 --> 14:43.950
–Now you listen to me.
–Zing!

14:47.860 --> 14:52.440
Every time somebody counts me
out of the game, I surprise them.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.910
You understand me?

14:55.920 --> 14:57.680
Not at all.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.860
Surprise me.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.930
Assistant District Attorney

15:20.340 --> 15:21.560
Hello. Terribly sorry.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.330
I'm, uh, my name's Katie Lloyd.

15:23.370 --> 15:26.538
I'm from the law firm
of Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

15:27.350 --> 15:31.890
I've just inherited the Joseph Washington
case and was wondering if I could
trouble you for a continuance.

15:31.930 --> 15:34.150
I'm sorry, did you say
Crane, Poole & Schmidt?

15:34.190 --> 15:35.490
That's right.

15:35.990 --> 15:37.020
Figures.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.610
May I? Get a continuance?
Just a-a wee one.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.370
You can, though we only plan
to enter a plea. Second degree.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.690
Oh, I see.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.310
Um, was there a particular
sentence involved?

15:50.350 --> 15:51.580
Life.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.786
That would work well
for your side, I suppose.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.360
So how much do you
know about your client?

16:00.400 --> 16:02.240
The relationship's still young.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.870
–And how old are you?
–25.

16:03.910 --> 16:06.120
–Have you ever tried a homicide case before?
–Never.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.080
–You ever tried any case before?
–Never.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.470
Oh, where are my manners?
Talking about me.

16:11.510 --> 16:14.220
Are you married? I beg your pardon.

16:17.970 --> 16:19.140
Gloria.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.420
I need—

16:21.860 --> 16:23.330
What?

16:23.720 --> 16:25.200
Oh, come on. I had a headache.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.190
That's never happened to you?

16:27.200 --> 16:31.094
After Denny called and said
he'd been arrested, I couldn't…

16:32.220 --> 16:33.310
perform.

16:34.370 --> 16:38.100
Was that the same headache this
morning, or a different one?

16:38.140 --> 16:39.530
The same.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.230
I think I'll have it as long as
these ridiculous charges are hanging
over Denny's aching head.

16:43.270 --> 16:47.140
Now if we could make the charges
disappear, my feeling is, so would the headache.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.640
Is that why you're here?

16:48.680 --> 16:49.680
Because let me tell
you something, Alan—

16:49.720 --> 16:51.140
Gloria, spare me the speech.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.270
Denny's practically
family. This was entrapment.

16:53.310 --> 16:56.350
It'll be an ugly trial, one which
you will be a part of as a witness.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.340
It's in everybody's favor
to make this go away.

16:58.380 --> 17:00.870
One of us here has
that power. It isn't me.

17:00.910 --> 17:03.480
Interesting to find out
where your priorities lie.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.150
So now we know.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.550
Alan…

17:09.910 --> 17:12.000
I still want that baby.

17:22.849 --> 17:24.980
What do you mean, you can't do it?

17:25.020 --> 17:28.600
The new head of litigation says I can't.

17:28.610 --> 17:30.560
We're— we're in
the quarterfinals.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.720
I know.

17:31.730 --> 17:35.080
I don't— I don't
understand. It isn't fair.

17:35.570 --> 17:38.580
Doris… cross-dressing…

17:38.960 --> 17:42.840
the public still perceives
it as some kind of sickness.

17:42.850 --> 17:44.800
Law firms…

17:47.120 --> 17:50.400
It's all about image.

17:51.690 --> 17:54.440
–We're in the quarterfinals.
–I know.

17:57.570 --> 18:01.350
You can… do it without me.

18:02.370 --> 18:03.950
Without you?

18:03.960 --> 18:06.600
You know I can't go
on stage without you.

18:06.640 --> 18:10.270
I was— I was only able to
leave my house 18 months ago.

18:14.670 --> 18:18.260
I can't lose my job, Doris.

18:20.710 --> 18:22.760
Okay.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.090
There's a reason why I
gave the money to Stanford.

18:28.130 --> 18:30.210
To get your niece in?

18:30.470 --> 18:31.750
Besides that.

18:31.760 --> 18:35.290
Given how much the government has
been co-opted by the oil companies,

18:35.330 --> 18:38.510
I felt at least academic
research would be neutral.

18:38.550 --> 18:41.210
But now —and this isn't
just happening at Stanford,

18:41.250 --> 18:45.050
by the way— Berkeley was given $500
million by a leading oil company,

18:45.090 --> 18:50.910
Princeton— do we think for a second these
contributions won't tilt these findings

18:50.920 --> 18:52.390
or steer them?

18:52.400 --> 18:54.700
Do you have any evidence
that they have?

18:54.740 --> 18:56.940
Oh, yes. The dean put out a memo.

18:56.950 --> 18:59.920
“We've been bought.”
What do you think?

18:59.930 --> 19:02.330
I'd— I'd like to
see that memo, please.

19:02.370 --> 19:07.760
Can you prove that anyone at any of
these universities has been bought,

19:07.770 --> 19:09.670
as you like to call it?
–No.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.400
Nor can we prove any elected
officials have been corrupted.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.600
We're not talking about
the government here, Shirley.

19:14.640 --> 19:18.070
This is a private entity, which
you pledged to give money to

19:18.110 --> 19:20.020
in order to support
research that—

19:20.060 --> 19:23.210
But I no longer trust
that research. Sorry.

19:23.620 --> 19:27.800
A study to explore
alternative energy sources

19:27.810 --> 19:30.870
essentially funded by an oil company…

19:30.880 --> 19:33.330
would you swallow that?

19:34.050 --> 19:38.630
“3-2-6-6-7— people
vs. Joseph Washington.”

19:38.640 --> 19:39.820
Good afternoon, your honor.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.972
Brad Chase for the commonwealth.

19:44.090 --> 19:45.370
Good afternoon, your honor.
Katie Lloyd.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.620
I'll be entering my appearance
on behalf of Mr Washington.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.970
The parties are prepared to offer
a plea agreement at this time.

19:50.010 --> 19:53.080
Mr Washington will agree to plead
guilty to murder in the second degree.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.750
Both the commonwealth and the defense offer
a joint recommendation for a life sentence.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.350
This is acceptable to you, Ms Lloyd?

19:58.390 --> 19:59.670
It is, your honor. Thank you.

19:59.710 --> 20:03.060
Mr Washington, you understand that
by pleading guilty you are admitting

20:03.100 --> 20:05.580
to the charges of the
commonwealth's complaint,

20:05.620 --> 20:08.800
alleging that on the
night of November 2, 2006,

20:08.810 --> 20:12.300
you, with malice aforethought, raped
and murdered Annie Harris Rivers?

20:12.340 --> 20:14.840
You further understand that
you most likely be serving

20:14.880 --> 20:19.500
the remainder of your natural
life in maximum security prison?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.720
Mr Washington…

20:21.730 --> 20:24.120
I need a response from you.

20:26.670 --> 20:28.840
Mr Washington?

20:28.850 --> 20:33.734
Sir, if I don't get a verbal response
from you, I cannot accept your plea.

20:36.390 --> 20:38.250
Counsel, have you spoken
to your client?

20:38.290 --> 20:39.750
Yes, your honor.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.300
One last time, Mr Washington,

20:42.310 --> 20:46.402
do you understand and accept
the terms of this plea agreement?

20:48.730 --> 20:49.940
The plea is rejected.

20:49.980 --> 20:53.220
We'll have opening
statements Tuesday, 10:00 A.M.

20:53.230 --> 20:54.130
Adjourned.

20:54.140 --> 20:55.770
Your honor, I'm sorry.
I just got this case.

20:55.810 --> 20:57.410
Might I get a continuance?
–No.

20:57.450 --> 21:00.980
–Your honor, it would seem, in the
interest of justice––
–Justice?

21:01.020 --> 21:02.970
Look back there, Mr Chase.

21:02.980 --> 21:07.790
I don't have to tell you that
the husband of the victim has
shown up in this courtroom repeatedly

21:07.830 --> 21:12.900
only to learn that the defendant has yet
again fired his lawyer at the last second.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.890
Mr Washington's previous
attorney wasn't fired.

21:14.930 --> 21:16.010
He jumped in front of a bus.

21:16.050 --> 21:17.200
I don't care.

21:17.210 --> 21:19.220
I'll see you Tuesday at 10:00.

21:20.230 --> 21:21.940
What do you mean?
It's going to trial?

21:21.980 --> 21:23.220
I thought they reached a plea.

21:23.260 --> 21:27.260
Seems our client didn't reach it. Or, if so,
was unwilling to communicate as much.

21:27.300 --> 21:29.620
Look, as much as I'd like to do
this, I've never tried anything.

21:29.660 --> 21:32.180
And Brad Chase is the DA?

21:32.190 --> 21:33.450
Hey, you!

21:35.740 --> 21:38.140
–Is it, uh, Jerry?
–Yes.

21:38.150 --> 21:40.740
Assist Ms Lloyd with her murder trial.

21:43.850 --> 21:45.020
Okay.

21:48.630 --> 21:51.630
I just got put on
a murder case. Murder.

21:52.130 --> 21:53.890
Can you believe it?

21:54.930 --> 21:58.020
You seem excited—
all of you.

21:58.410 --> 22:00.130
What's wrong?

22:00.720 --> 22:04.640
Sack… made me withdraw
from the singing contest.

22:04.650 --> 22:08.070
What? How did he
even know about it?

22:08.080 --> 22:09.790
Sorry.

22:10.090 --> 22:13.640
Somebody took video and
put it on YouTube, so…

22:13.650 --> 22:14.680
now I'm out.

22:14.690 --> 22:16.820
But you're in the quarterfinals.

22:16.830 --> 22:18.460
I know.

22:18.470 --> 22:22.320
This Sack is a bad, bad
person. I don't like this Sack.

22:22.330 --> 22:24.170
What about Doris?

22:24.180 --> 22:27.100
She's… destroyed.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.800
Tell Alan. He'll fix it.

22:28.840 --> 22:29.680
Or tell Shirley.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.440
I can fight my own battles.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.080
Clearly you can't, Clarence.

22:35.260 --> 22:37.120
I didn't mean it like that.

22:37.130 --> 22:40.310
Tell Alan. He'll fix that sackhead.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.130
Tell him.

22:51.540 --> 22:56.870
Most of the tenants maintain
that you were an excellent
and very reliable custodian.

22:56.910 --> 23:01.398
But several alluded to a possible
obsession you had with the victim.

23:01.960 --> 23:07.150
One woman remarked that she
thought you invented maintenance
issues in Mrs Rivers' unit

23:07.190 --> 23:09.220
just to get close to her.

23:09.620 --> 23:12.040
Is any of this true?

23:13.860 --> 23:17.540
Your semen was found
inside and on the victim.

23:17.550 --> 23:19.850
I'm sure you've been told this.

23:22.240 --> 23:26.010
Mr Washington, you must talk to us.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.800
Mr Washington…

23:30.810 --> 23:36.790
we will go in and fight very
hard for you, but you need to help.

23:48.590 --> 23:50.640
May I speak with you a second?

23:50.640 --> 23:52.900
Only if you can make it quick,
Clarence. I'm off to court.

23:52.940 --> 23:55.340
Okay. I quit.

23:56.930 --> 23:58.340
A little less quick.

23:58.340 --> 24:01.350
I entered a singing contest
as Clarice with a friend.

24:01.390 --> 24:02.790
We've made the quarterfinals.

24:02.830 --> 24:07.600
Carl Sack found out, said cross-dressers
aren't commensurate with the firm's image.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.510
He told me to withdraw or else.

24:10.510 --> 24:11.940
I'm choosing else.

24:11.940 --> 24:15.080
I thought… Clarice was on sabbatical.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.930
She still comes out sometimes.

24:16.970 --> 24:18.500
I entered the contest as her.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.480
It's the only way I could
get on stage and sing,

24:20.520 --> 24:23.660
but if I want to keep
going, I'll get fired.

24:23.660 --> 24:26.040
So I decided I'd quit and
save everybody some time.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.700
All right, look…

24:28.460 --> 24:32.490
there is no way I would
let Carl Sack fire you.

24:32.490 --> 24:34.910
Having said that, two
things can happen here.

24:34.950 --> 24:37.320
I can fix this, or you can.

24:37.660 --> 24:41.050
Your goal is to be a full-time
lawyer here, is it not?

24:41.090 --> 24:42.230
Yes.

24:42.230 --> 24:46.160
Well, then I would suggest you
go make your case to Carl Sack…

24:46.200 --> 24:47.870
as you.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.500
You asked to see us, your honor?

25:03.540 --> 25:05.070
Yes. Thank you.

25:05.070 --> 25:08.520
You'll be dropping the charges
against Denny Crane immediately.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.580
Thank you.

25:14.490 --> 25:15.370
There a problem?

25:15.410 --> 25:16.670
The charges are valid.

25:16.710 --> 25:21.200
No, they're not. I was there, counsel,
at least earlier in the evening.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.310
I saw the officer's behavior
as well as her attire.

25:24.350 --> 25:27.950
She cultivated any predisposition
on Mr Crane's part.

25:27.950 --> 25:31.340
This is beyond entrapment.
You're done.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.020
With all due respect,

25:34.020 --> 25:35.910
your relationship with the
defendant's best friend—

25:35.950 --> 25:37.510
Has no bearing whatsoever,

25:37.550 --> 25:41.670
but it would certainly be called into
play should this case ever reach trial,

25:41.710 --> 25:43.660
which would really piss me off.

25:43.700 --> 25:48.060
And I don't think you really mean to
incur the wrath of a superior court judge,

25:48.100 --> 25:50.820
especially one that
can be such a bitch.

25:50.820 --> 25:56.628
You will drop it today before any further
investigation reveals Mr Crane to be a target.

25:57.530 --> 25:59.750
Get out.

26:05.070 --> 26:09.260
For the past 11 years, I've taught a
class at Harvard on oil and economics,

26:09.300 --> 26:12.050
and I've focused
specifically on capture.

26:12.350 --> 26:13.670
–Capture?
–Yes.

26:13.670 --> 26:16.000
Big oil capturing academia.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.070
It's already happened in the United
Kingdom, now it's happening here.

26:19.110 --> 26:21.190
And they do this by donating money?

26:21.230 --> 26:23.590
Yes. Their sponsorship has
some influence, obviously,

26:23.630 --> 26:27.210
but what's even more dangerous is
that it's an insidious recruiting tool.

26:27.250 --> 26:30.940
Oil companies are making their branding
visible to young, impressionable students.

26:30.980 --> 26:31.810
And, by the way,

26:31.850 --> 26:36.430
we've already seen some universities
actually tailor their course curriculum
to serve the industry.

26:36.470 --> 26:41.220
But let's be fair. Some of these
courses are geared toward
reducing fossil fuel dependency.

26:41.260 --> 26:43.910
Yes, but most of the
research is geological,

26:43.950 --> 26:47.280
where to find new oil fields
and how to exploit them.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.320
It's ridiculous.

26:49.320 --> 26:54.336
Do you have any information as to the
pledge made by Ms Schmidt to Stanford?

26:56.240 --> 26:57.500
No.

26:58.140 --> 27:03.288
Do you have any opinion as to whether
a valid contract was formed here or not?

27:04.650 --> 27:06.170
No.

27:14.210 --> 27:16.190
You really can't win this, Alan.

27:16.230 --> 27:19.360
The courts consider these
donations binding contracts.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.460
People reconsider financial
pledges all the time.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.020
And get sued.

27:24.020 --> 27:28.670
Come on. Stanford doesn't want
the publicity of a trial here.

27:29.660 --> 27:32.060
Make me an offer, and I'll go away.

27:33.310 --> 27:35.490
If you want me to go away.

27:36.380 --> 27:37.900
Oh.

27:53.980 --> 27:57.750
I had a dream not too long ago
about… you in an elevator.

27:57.750 --> 27:59.310
Really?

27:59.950 --> 28:03.360
Was I going up or going down?

28:06.360 --> 28:08.440
What are you doing?

28:08.440 --> 28:10.960
Is it serious with this judge?

28:11.240 --> 28:12.850
Lorraine, start the elevator.

28:12.890 --> 28:14.960
You start it.

28:16.770 --> 28:18.730
I'm not in a good enough shape for this.

28:18.770 --> 28:20.630
For what?

28:23.420 --> 28:25.910
You dropped your trial bag.

28:25.910 --> 28:27.210
Did I?

28:27.210 --> 28:31.580
You and I should not… be… doing…

28:32.670 --> 28:34.310
a case together.

28:34.310 --> 28:35.910
I agree.

28:35.910 --> 28:38.140
We need to settle it, don't we?

28:42.180 --> 28:44.410
Make me an offer.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.330
Right in the elevator?

29:00.330 --> 29:02.550
Yeah, I know.

29:02.550 --> 29:04.690
I'm in a monogamous
relationship, for God's sake.

29:04.730 --> 29:06.850
One founded very much on trust.

29:06.850 --> 29:09.880
Alan, here's the thing about
monogamy— it only works if you cheat.

29:09.920 --> 29:12.530
Please don't be glib, Denny.
I'm not at all happy about this.

29:12.570 --> 29:14.240
I'm sorry.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.310
What are you doing?

29:15.350 --> 29:17.800
I'm checking on your flow.

29:18.510 --> 29:21.290
I got weak stream syndrome.

29:21.290 --> 29:23.290
You got nice velocity there.

29:24.140 --> 29:25.990
Look at me.

29:27.220 --> 29:28.320
That's not so bad.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.210
Oh, please.

29:30.210 --> 29:32.570
I've seen drip coffee percolate faster.

29:32.610 --> 29:34.830
Denny, you're 75. It's fine.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.870
Oh, see, that was good.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.196
You're not just saying so?

29:42.520 --> 29:43.600
You're a little red there.

29:43.640 --> 29:45.760
Mm. It's ashamed.

29:45.760 --> 29:48.050
Knows it's been bad.

29:52.580 --> 29:53.970
What?

29:53.970 --> 29:55.590
–What?

29:59.140 --> 30:00.660
What do you mean, go with you?

30:00.700 --> 30:04.690
Uh, I need to put a human face on it.

30:04.690 --> 30:06.410
Well, why can't you put your face on it?

30:06.450 --> 30:09.720
I will. I just want to add yours.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.220
It'll help, Doris.

30:11.220 --> 30:14.360
We can go right in to
see him… tomorrow.

30:14.360 --> 30:15.770
What's going on?

30:15.770 --> 30:17.640
We're gonna make our case with Sack.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.900
“We”?

30:18.900 --> 30:20.560
I'll do the talking.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.850
How's the murder case going?

30:21.890 --> 30:25.510
Horrible. The client left blood, semen,
fingerprints, and he won't talk to us.

30:25.550 --> 30:26.530
Horrible!

30:26.530 --> 30:28.230
I apologize for my coarse language.

30:28.270 --> 30:32.362
Katie's gone back to try again,
but he won't talk. It's awful.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.020
We go to trial in five
days, Mr Washington.

30:38.060 --> 30:40.500
You need to talk to me.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.620
The evidence is insurmountable—
your semen at the scene,

30:44.660 --> 30:47.460
traces of her blood on your
locker, your confession,

30:47.500 --> 30:49.470
which didn't exactly
advance our cause.

30:49.510 --> 30:51.490
And if you don't cooperate
with us, then we'll have—

30:51.530 --> 30:53.420
Aah!

30:58.130 --> 31:03.850
Down! Down! Get down!

31:15.700 --> 31:18.020
You should probably go, counselor.

31:18.020 --> 31:20.300
No.

31:22.140 --> 31:24.410
May we continue,
Mr Washington?

31:26.660 --> 31:28.740
Please help my client up.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.540
–You got him?
–Yeah.

31:37.680 --> 31:41.160
You get one more chance,
Joe. Solitary's next.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.500
All right. Mr Washington…

31:57.840 --> 32:00.070
did you not commit this crime?

32:02.550 --> 32:04.510
I asked you a question.

32:05.100 --> 32:07.410
Did you not commit this crime?

32:14.750 --> 32:16.960
You're innocent.

32:23.410 --> 32:25.620
We were together
for about 6 months.

32:25.660 --> 32:28.940
Secret— that's
the way she wanted it.

32:28.940 --> 32:32.768
And the liaisons would always
take place in her apartment?

32:35.490 --> 32:38.270
The night that she was
killed, you were there.

32:38.310 --> 32:40.690
Uh, we got together around 5:00.

32:40.690 --> 32:43.560
She was killed around 6:00.

32:43.970 --> 32:46.660
It had to have happened
just after I left.

32:46.700 --> 32:49.570
Her blood on your locker…

32:53.000 --> 32:55.400
Somebody put it there.

32:55.400 --> 32:58.050
Somebody had to have put it there.

33:03.010 --> 33:04.150
But he confessed.

33:04.150 --> 33:08.120
After 36 hours of sleep deprivation and
who knows what other kind of coercion.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.580
Jerry, this is a man who's never
received a break from anybody.

33:10.620 --> 33:13.120
Every lawyer he's ever had
has tried to plead him guilty.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.920
He's just resigned
himself to being convicted.

33:14.960 --> 33:18.750
Well, if he didn't do it, who did?

33:19.810 --> 33:21.730
I haven't the slightest idea.

33:22.440 --> 33:23.530
She was seeing a therapist.

33:23.570 --> 33:26.540
If we can establish that she and Joseph were
having an affair— I'm gonna pay him a visit.

33:26.580 --> 33:30.110
Katie, our client…
have you seen his priors?

33:30.110 --> 33:32.730
I think he's innocent. I really do.

33:41.140 --> 33:44.640
The idea that we would
contaminate our findings is as…

33:44.680 --> 33:47.320
preposterous as it is offensive.

33:47.320 --> 33:52.530
Well, if you're given, say,
$100 million by somebody,

33:52.530 --> 33:56.170
don't you at least feel some
obligation to pay the piper a little?

33:56.210 --> 33:58.880
Well, if by “pay the piper”
you mean fudge the science,

33:58.920 --> 33:59.900
no.

33:59.900 --> 34:02.280
I must admit, I know
nothing about this,

34:02.320 --> 34:05.250
uh, research funding business.

34:05.250 --> 34:08.050
In my line of work, if somebody
who should remain neutral

34:08.090 --> 34:11.710
takes money from one of the interested
parties, we call that a bribe.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.810
There is no <i>quid pro quo</i> whatsoever.

34:14.810 --> 34:18.699
So these oil companies give you
money to find ways to put them
out of business because…

34:18.739 --> 34:22.090
We don't ask what their expectations
are because they're not relevant.

34:22.130 --> 34:24.790
Well, do you think maybe they're
doing this for the environmental good?

34:24.830 --> 34:28.580
Objection. Counsel is
being very… naughty.

34:36.679 --> 34:40.159
I would appreciate it if you
could stop with the little…

34:40.199 --> 34:41.659
comments in there.

34:41.659 --> 34:42.429
What comments?

34:42.469 --> 34:45.260
“Naughty” and, uh, uh,
uh, well, n-naughty.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.409
I was simply objecting to your cross.

34:47.449 --> 34:49.639
Perhaps it was your
conscience saying “naughty”.

34:49.679 --> 34:51.699
Or maybe your <i>id</i>.

34:51.699 --> 34:55.130
You have a very active <i>id</i>, Alan.

34:55.710 --> 34:58.370
I don't want to play, Lorraine.

34:58.370 --> 35:01.580
But it's what I do. You
never complained before.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.740
Forget it. Not a chance.

35:15.980 --> 35:17.640
Uh… Mr Sack?

35:17.980 --> 35:19.660
Clarence.

35:20.370 --> 35:22.260
This is Doris Thumper.

35:22.260 --> 35:24.680
You may remember
seeing her on the video.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.400
I do.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.560
You've got quite the voice, Doris.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.000
Thank you.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.390
Doris and I met in shyness
therapy three years ago.

35:33.390 --> 35:35.940
She was borderline
agoraphobic at the time.

35:35.980 --> 35:37.750
Wow.

35:37.750 --> 35:38.980
You've made progress.

35:39.020 --> 35:40.050
Yes.

35:40.050 --> 35:44.650
This singing contest is maybe the
biggest thing that's happened to her.

35:44.690 --> 35:46.640
Maybe me, too.

35:47.750 --> 35:50.320
I've decided not to withdraw.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.200
Have you?

35:52.200 --> 35:56.150
If you choose to fire
me, that's your right.

35:56.150 --> 35:58.130
Thank you.

36:06.390 --> 36:10.770
Uh… I'm… not sure
why you came here.

36:11.520 --> 36:14.460
Maybe it was to remake this
law firm into something—

36:14.500 --> 36:17.290
Resembling a law firm?

36:18.020 --> 36:23.410
I understand the decision to project
conservatism and reasonableness and modesty,

36:23.410 --> 36:27.580
but Boston is full of those
firms. As is New York and…

36:27.580 --> 36:30.130
well, I guess, every city.

36:30.130 --> 36:33.610
The people I went to law school with
work at many of them.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.990
They all have one thing in common.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.560
They're not happy.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.010
People here are.

36:41.010 --> 36:44.360
Maybe because they're
not afraid of themselves.

36:44.360 --> 36:48.190
One lawyer likes to purr and hop.

36:48.190 --> 36:50.560
Partners and associates…

36:50.560 --> 36:53.200
have sex with each other sometimes.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.890
We've got two men who take
five minutes out of every single day

36:56.930 --> 36:59.530
to celebrate their
friendship on a balcony.

36:59.570 --> 37:02.670
Now how many people do you
know who actually do that?

37:02.710 --> 37:06.430
I occasionally throw on a
dress, and I like to sing.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.930
I don't want to be one of
those lawyers at other firms,

37:09.970 --> 37:13.250
choking on… modesty
and reasonableness.

37:13.250 --> 37:15.430
I'm surprised that you do.

37:17.420 --> 37:21.940
If your mission here is to
make this into a normal…

37:22.260 --> 37:24.890
law firm…

37:25.810 --> 37:29.510
I really hope you fail…

37:31.010 --> 37:33.520
for everybody's sake.

37:55.210 --> 37:57.240
It's a valid
contract—

37:57.360 --> 38:03.440
properly negotiated, both parties
were knowing, consenting, willing.

38:03.560 --> 38:06.050
If she had wanted to place certain
restrictions on her donation

38:06.090 --> 38:08.960
she certainly could have. She didn't.

38:09.910 --> 38:12.250
Hello.

38:13.780 --> 38:18.730
Now as for big oil getting involved
in research to combat global warming,

38:18.860 --> 38:22.580
are we seriously against that?
My God.

38:22.660 --> 38:24.320
For years, we've
been hammering them—

38:24.360 --> 38:25.870
“You're a big part of the problem.

38:25.910 --> 38:27.330
Be part of the solution.”

38:27.370 --> 38:31.240
Now, thankfully, some of these
companies are trying to do just that,

38:31.280 --> 38:34.290
and given that they're
billion-dollar companies,

38:34.330 --> 38:37.250
if they want to join the fight
against greenhouse emissions,

38:37.290 --> 38:41.710
that should make us,
well… orgasmic.

38:44.170 --> 38:47.220
Are you not, just a little?

39:09.240 --> 39:12.710
Let's look at what's
happened in Washington.

39:12.830 --> 39:17.260
These huge, uh, corporations
that poison our drinking water,

39:17.390 --> 39:21.180
foul our air, uh, lay waste to our lands

39:21.290 --> 39:24.450
have discovered that instead of
trying to influence government,

39:24.490 --> 39:26.210
better to simply become government.

39:26.250 --> 39:29.620
And with a little help from a friend in
a very high place, they've done just that.

39:29.660 --> 39:32.200
Over 100 top environmental posts

39:32.320 --> 39:35.470
have been passed out to
representatives of polluting industries.

39:35.510 --> 39:37.292
Can you fathom that, judge?

39:37.340 --> 39:39.518
Don't you be asking me to fathom.

39:39.570 --> 39:42.700
I am not a, uh, fathomer.

39:42.830 --> 39:44.910
Almost every agency responsible

39:45.120 --> 39:47.130
for protecting America from pollution

39:47.170 --> 39:50.690
is now being headed up by somebody
from the pollution industry.

39:50.730 --> 39:51.690
The fix is in.

39:51.810 --> 39:54.100
How does this involve
Stanford university?

39:54.140 --> 39:57.506
It involves a need in this
country for independent,

39:57.540 --> 40:01.100
unbiased, uncorrupted
environmental research.

40:01.220 --> 40:03.720
And since it's obviously
not coming from Washington,

40:03.760 --> 40:06.400
academia is obviously our best,
if not our only hope.

40:06.440 --> 40:10.460
And now it, too, is being
co-opted by big pollution.

40:10.590 --> 40:12.670
The facts are that the oil industry

40:12.710 --> 40:15.710
has systematically
campaigned to create doubt

40:15.830 --> 40:18.670
as to the very existence
of global warming,

40:18.800 --> 40:22.050
pumping millions of
dollars into think tanks,

40:22.160 --> 40:26.780
consumer groups, media outlets,
uh, religious and civic organizations,

40:26.800 --> 40:30.720
every penny aimed at diffusing
the concern over climate change.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.540
Now they're privatizing
university research—

40:33.580 --> 40:35.980
Berkeley, Princeton, now Stanford.

40:36.090 --> 40:38.690
Do we truly want
our universities—

40:38.810 --> 40:43.000
the breeding grounds for tomorrow's
leaders, innovators, visionaries—

40:43.040 --> 40:46.850
do we truly want them climbing
into bed with the oil companies?

40:46.890 --> 40:50.650
–Strange bedfellows.
–Lorraine, stop it.

40:56.090 --> 40:58.600
Your honor, at some point,

40:58.710 --> 41:02.350
a little common sense has
to prevail in this country.

41:02.470 --> 41:04.990
We've started a war, in part for oil,

41:05.120 --> 41:07.840
one we may never get
out of in our lifetime.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.840
Of all the industrialized
nations in the world,

41:10.880 --> 41:12.640
we're the biggest
contributor to greenhouse

41:12.680 --> 41:14.860
gas emissions, and we
do the least about it.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.408
We thumb our nose at the Kyoto treaty.

41:17.510 --> 41:21.290
Our government actually censors
scientific reports from the E.P.A

41:21.330 --> 41:24.660
and others, to edit out little
findings they don't like.

41:24.700 --> 41:27.390
Even the, uh, democratic
presidential hopefuls

41:27.430 --> 41:29.550
uh, don't talk about this because
they don't want to jeopardize

41:29.590 --> 41:32.120
their campaign
contributions from big oil.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.750
Big oil, big
politics—

41:34.860 --> 41:37.880
do we all really intend to sit quietly

41:38.000 --> 41:41.470
as they infiltrate
vital academic research?

41:41.530 --> 41:43.600
Is that what we want?

41:43.720 --> 41:46.700
Is that who we are?

41:53.730 --> 41:56.172
May I ask just a couple of questions?

41:56.220 --> 41:58.000
Certainly.

41:58.130 --> 42:00.760
You did go to law school, right?

42:00.890 --> 42:04.670
And you, Jerry, you've actually
practiced, I've been told.

42:04.710 --> 42:06.640
You are a mean, mean man,

42:06.770 --> 42:08.530
and I don't like what
you said to Clarence.

42:08.570 --> 42:12.650
And I don't think you fit in here at all
because you're a mean, mean man.

42:12.690 --> 42:14.736
Care to button that with a hop?

42:15.540 --> 42:19.930
Okay, Jerry, I am a good
man, just a very poor wizard.

42:20.070 --> 42:22.370
And unless either of
you happen to be wizards,

42:22.410 --> 42:24.230
why aren't you pleading this case out?

42:24.270 --> 42:26.340
I tried. Joseph wouldn't
answer the judge.

42:26.380 --> 42:28.040
So she refused to accept the plea.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.460
As far as I understand
it, Joseph wasn't speaking

42:29.500 --> 42:31.610
because he was an uncommunicative beast.

42:31.650 --> 42:32.800
Now he's talking. He trusts you.

42:32.840 --> 42:36.140
So he should trust your recommendation
that he plead to second-degree murder.

42:36.180 --> 42:37.830
There's only one problem.

42:38.270 --> 42:39.510
He's innocent.

42:39.630 --> 42:40.640
I beg your pardon?

42:40.680 --> 42:42.110
He didn't kill that woman.

42:42.150 --> 42:43.866
Ah. And you know this how?

42:43.980 --> 42:44.920
He told me.

42:45.020 --> 42:47.600
–Oh, he told you.
–Mean.

42:49.370 --> 42:51.150
–What's going on?
–Great news.

42:51.190 --> 42:52.840
The client has declared his innocence.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.690
I'd appreciate you not being snide.

42:54.730 --> 42:57.140
This goes to trial Tuesday, this Tuesday.

42:57.180 --> 42:59.754
Oh, did I mention they have no defense?

42:59.790 --> 43:01.210
Alan, you take over.

43:01.340 --> 43:02.910
Me? What about Jerry?

43:02.960 --> 43:04.346
Please. At a minimum,

43:04.350 --> 43:07.640
we could use your involvement
to get judge Glo-glo recused,
that could buy us some time.

43:07.680 --> 43:10.050
And, Katie, no offense, but
you're not ready for this.

43:10.090 --> 43:11.300
I understand.

43:11.420 --> 43:13.370
There is a suppression
hearing scheduled for tomorrow.

43:13.410 --> 43:15.522
Shirley, I'm not ready for this.

43:15.620 --> 43:17.350
You've tried cases on the fly before.

43:17.390 --> 43:20.020
Not first-degree murder.
You say he confessed?

43:20.060 --> 43:22.060
He did. That's what
we're trying to suppress.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.880
And as for evidence?

43:24.010 --> 43:26.410
Joseph was the last
one seen with her alive.

43:26.450 --> 43:29.290
Uh, his semen was found on
her, her blood on his locker.

43:29.330 --> 43:31.890
And he has a violent criminal past.

43:33.860 --> 43:37.094
He's nothing but a
mean, mean man, this sackhead.

43:37.200 --> 43:41.430
–What'd he do now?
–Oh, he's just mean and snide and smug.

43:41.550 --> 43:42.960
I expect him to fire me any second.

43:43.000 --> 43:43.900
I thought you quit.

43:43.940 --> 43:45.280
Well, I'm giving him time to reconsider.

43:45.320 --> 43:50.050
–What “reconsider”? From the way you
explained it, you said you quit. –Shh.

43:50.090 --> 43:52.140
–I thought you quit.
–Told ya.

43:55.250 --> 43:58.600
I thought maybe you'd change your mind.

43:58.730 --> 44:00.100
You thought I'd change my mind?

44:00.140 --> 44:01.680
So you really didn't quit?

44:01.720 --> 44:03.940
Well, in that case, you're fired.

44:04.640 --> 44:07.100
Oh, sorry.

44:07.730 --> 44:09.780
First, I was kidding.

44:09.910 --> 44:14.110
Second, if I were not,
you don't head-butt, ever.

44:15.810 --> 44:18.140
You may keep your job, Clarence.

44:18.260 --> 44:20.790
I thought about what you said. I agree.

44:20.830 --> 44:22.200
People need to be embraced,

44:22.240 --> 44:27.000
sometimes for their differences,
instead of being excluded.

44:27.110 --> 44:30.090
We talk it. I suppose we should walk it.

44:30.690 --> 44:33.130
Good luck with your contest.

44:33.670 --> 44:35.370
Hug?

44:35.800 --> 44:38.580
Uh, you're welcome
to come watch. 8:00.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.780
Maybe next time.

44:40.910 --> 44:42.720
Shame.

44:46.090 --> 44:47.320
I can't believe you did that.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.930
Oh, shut up.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.234
I want to know why Carl
Sack was brought in here.

45:02.430 --> 45:04.650
Because I need help managing things.

45:04.690 --> 45:05.600
You got me.

45:05.740 --> 45:08.770
Yeah, you're one of the
things I need help managing…

45:08.810 --> 45:11.160
all your nonsense.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.400
So how'd it go with the hooker?

45:14.440 --> 45:16.900
–Oh, case was dropped.
–Great.

45:18.480 --> 45:22.030
And… why the waders?

45:23.570 --> 45:26.150
Well… I may not be
the lawyer I once was,

45:26.190 --> 45:29.292
but I can still fish
circles around all of you.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.690
And sometimes I just…

45:32.810 --> 45:35.660
like to put them on and…

45:40.560 --> 45:42.280
When…

45:42.400 --> 45:44.610
when I was in high school…

45:45.020 --> 45:47.940
I was captain of the debate team,

45:48.070 --> 45:53.800
class president and miserable over
being cut from the cheerleading team.

45:53.910 --> 45:54.880
So I…

45:54.990 --> 45:57.570
I went out and bought my own outfit,

45:57.680 --> 45:59.240
complete with pom-poms.

45:59.360 --> 46:02.630
I would dress up and stand in front
of the mirror in the little skirt,

46:02.670 --> 46:04.740
the white socks, the sweater.

46:04.860 --> 46:06.480
It-it somehow
made me feel better.

46:06.520 --> 46:10.610
And… then y-years after…

46:11.380 --> 46:12.620
after I was a lawyer,

46:12.660 --> 46:16.730
even a partner, if I was
feeling particularly low,

46:16.850 --> 46:20.940
I would pull out that
costume and put it on.

46:21.060 --> 46:22.800
You know, I used to do the same thing.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.040
Without the pom-poms,
of course, but—

46:24.080 --> 46:28.340
You are just determined not to let me
have a vulnerable moment, aren't you?

46:28.380 --> 46:31.040
You want to hog them all to yourself.

46:36.030 --> 46:38.010
Denny…

46:38.120 --> 46:39.900
we're getting older.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.370
We-we don't even fit in
our outfits anymore, but…

46:45.860 --> 46:49.860
we're not over, not by a long shot.

46:50.510 --> 46:53.170
You're not over.

46:53.600 --> 46:57.140
Y-you know what used to make
me feel better than anything?

46:57.180 --> 46:58.410
If it's sexual, I don't want—

46:58.450 --> 47:00.250
No no no no,

47:00.540 --> 47:02.900
it was back when we…

47:04.920 --> 47:08.130
were “us”.

47:08.250 --> 47:10.160
–You used to put your head on my—
–Denny!

47:10.200 --> 47:12.940
I was gonna say “shoulder”…

47:14.480 --> 47:17.650
That felt better than anything…

47:18.240 --> 47:22.520
I remember you singing,
“You Are My Sunshine”.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.310
Would you- would you do that, just
for a minute? Put your head on my shoulder?

47:29.350 --> 47:30.850
Denny…

47:30.950 --> 47:34.160
I just want to remember.

47:36.370 --> 47:39.330
I don't think my neck
even bends, anymore.

47:39.440 --> 47:42.190
Please…

47:42.320 --> 47:45.170
Sure.

47:48.590 --> 47:54.780
Oh, this feels... Would you put on
that cheerleader outfit just for a—

47:54.780 --> 47:56.000
Don't push it.

48:05.450 --> 48:08.970
“You are my sunshine...”

48:09.810 --> 48:33.750
“my only sunshine… you make me happy…
when skies are grey… you'll never know dear...”

48:46.330 --> 48:49.230
Mr Washington… Hello.

48:51.310 --> 48:53.620
May I call you Joseph?

48:55.520 --> 48:57.302
How about “chuckles”, then?

49:03.930 --> 49:06.250
I realize you've formed a…

49:06.380 --> 49:09.270
special bond with Katie.

49:09.390 --> 49:12.580
She pulled a thorn from your
paw like Aesop's fable.

49:12.620 --> 49:17.420
But this is the real world, and
she's never tried a case before.

49:18.390 --> 49:23.430
I doubt very much yours can be
won, but if there's any hope…

49:25.280 --> 49:27.690
it's not Katie Lloyd.

49:27.810 --> 49:30.070
You're not right for me.

49:30.680 --> 49:31.610
Why is that?

49:31.730 --> 49:33.670
You think I'm guilty.

49:34.250 --> 49:36.750
Mr Washington…

49:36.860 --> 49:41.310
I have no idea if you're guilty,
and frankly, I don't care.

49:41.420 --> 49:45.000
But here's the thing
about confessions and

49:45.110 --> 49:47.130
leaving semen on a victim—

49:51.660 --> 49:53.670
Your hand is on my knee.

49:53.780 --> 49:56.510
That's either a threatening
gesture or sexual.

49:56.550 --> 49:59.340
Either way, I'm not comfortable.

49:59.460 --> 50:02.350
I know about the real world,
Mr Shore.

50:02.480 --> 50:06.100
I lived my whole life
in the real world.

50:07.180 --> 50:10.580
Katie Lloyd will be my lawyer.

50:16.040 --> 50:17.500
I-is he out of his mind?

50:17.540 --> 50:20.690
I'd suggest he plead
insanity, but I think he'd kill me.

50:20.730 --> 50:22.240
So what happens now?

50:22.360 --> 50:24.700
Well, they have the motion to
suppress the confession at 11:00.

50:24.740 --> 50:26.110
I hope to get back for that.

50:26.150 --> 50:29.450
Alan, he cannot trust his
life to Katie and Jerry.

50:29.640 --> 50:32.780
All rise.

50:37.300 --> 50:39.250
Be seated.

50:41.840 --> 50:43.100
All right.

50:43.130 --> 50:48.980
The case here presents very
complicated and challenging issues,

50:49.020 --> 50:56.160
which I find to be extremely
complicated and, uh, challenging.

50:56.190 --> 51:01.940
I don't know what Ms Schmidt thought
when she pledged her donation.

51:01.970 --> 51:07.350
Truth is, I didn't understand half
of what was said by anybody.

51:07.370 --> 51:10.660
Therefore, as a matter of law,

51:10.690 --> 51:13.370
there's been no meeting of the minds.

51:13.410 --> 51:16.410
Your honor, it's not your mind that
need meet up with anything.

51:16.450 --> 51:20.150
Silence.
I am the decider.

51:20.190 --> 51:22.720
And I have made my…

51:22.750 --> 51:25.400
deciding act.

51:25.420 --> 51:28.940
There is no binding contract.

51:28.970 --> 51:31.350
Judgment in favor of Ms Schmidt.

51:31.380 --> 51:33.430
The law wins out again, barely.

51:33.470 --> 51:35.840
Alan, thank you.
Really.

51:36.890 --> 51:38.410
Congratulations.

51:38.440 --> 51:40.020
Thank you, Lorraine.

51:40.040 --> 51:42.130
No hard feelings?

51:42.160 --> 51:43.780
None…

51:43.800 --> 51:45.630
I assure you.

51:45.660 --> 51:47.920
Oh, please.

51:52.930 --> 51:55.570
All right, Ms Lloyd, I'll hear from you.

51:59.030 --> 52:00.560
Thank you, your honor.

52:00.590 --> 52:01.570
May it please the court,

52:01.610 --> 52:03.890
the prosecution seeks
to admit as evidence

52:03.930 --> 52:06.930
an oral confession made by
our client Joseph Washington,

52:06.970 --> 52:09.340
which confession, upon
information and belief,

52:09.380 --> 52:13.540
was the product of a coercive,
involuntary and unconstitutional interrogation

52:13.580 --> 52:15.690
lasting days in duration,
the entirety of which,

52:15.730 --> 52:18.690
my client was without counsel present,
pursuant to his Sixth Amendment right.

52:18.730 --> 52:22.790
Your honor, the suspect never asked
for a lawyer. In fact, he never said anything,

52:22.830 --> 52:26.130
and the fact that his confession
was made after a protracted interrogation

52:26.170 --> 52:28.140
does not make it involuntary.

52:28.170 --> 52:29.540
May it please the court,

52:29.580 --> 52:33.180
I would argue that sleep deprivation
constitutes physical discomfiture.

52:33.220 --> 52:35.880
He was allowed to sleep.
He was left alone many times.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.230
Never for more than an hour.

52:37.270 --> 52:39.930
There was no bed.
Just a chair and a concrete floor.

52:39.970 --> 52:44.530
90% of all confessions are
obtained in exactly this way.

52:44.570 --> 52:46.530
A suspect is worn down.

52:46.560 --> 52:49.266
It's an accepted form
of police practice.

53:01.930 --> 53:03.740
That doesn't make it right.

53:03.770 --> 53:08.460
If you read the text, Mr Washington
shouted out in frustrated defiance repeatedly.

53:08.500 --> 53:10.780
His so-called confession
was a product of duress.

53:10.820 --> 53:13.110
So why not just argue that to the jury

53:13.150 --> 53:15.600
and let them weigh in
on the probative value?

53:15.640 --> 53:19.330
Well, first of all,
once you say “confession,”

53:19.370 --> 53:21.870
people just draw conclusions.

53:21.910 --> 53:24.230
Second, your honor, with all due respect,

53:24.270 --> 53:26.880
the only means we would have for
challenging the validity of the confession

53:26.920 --> 53:28.530
is to put our client on the stand.

53:28.570 --> 53:30.830
If we do that, they get to introduce
all his prior felonies,

53:30.870 --> 53:32.990
which could be more prejudicial
than the confession even.

53:33.030 --> 53:37.770
Look, I have no doubt that your client
was subjected to relentless pressure.

53:37.810 --> 53:40.840
But it didn't rise to the point of coercion.

53:40.870 --> 53:43.190
I'm going to allow the evidence
of the confession.

53:43.230 --> 53:45.750
We'll see you all in division 16.

54:15.070 --> 54:16.570
We'll be fine.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.160
What if I forget to breathe?

54:18.200 --> 54:19.710
We'll be okay.

54:19.730 --> 54:21.180
I think you should  go on first, Clarence.

54:21.220 --> 54:23.660
No, we rehearsed it with you.

54:24.920 --> 54:28.840
I know I shouldn't be seeing the girls before
their wigs and pasties are on, but here you go.

54:28.880 --> 54:30.370
Alan, thank you.

54:30.400 --> 54:32.260
You came.
–Of course I came.

54:32.290 --> 54:33.920
This must be Doris.

54:33.960 --> 54:35.870
Doris Thumper, Alan Shore.

54:35.900 --> 54:37.820
–You look lovely.
–Thank you.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.650
Shirley wanted to come,
but she had a dinner.

54:39.690 --> 54:41.420
We're not going on.

54:41.450 --> 54:44.550
Yes, we are.
Maybe.

54:46.080 --> 54:47.300
We're afraid.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.930
Well, of course you are.

54:48.960 --> 54:51.480
How could you not be?
It's a contest.

54:51.500 --> 54:54.790
Oh, if only you knew what I know.

54:54.810 --> 54:57.010
–What do you know?
–That you're gonna be great.

54:57.050 --> 55:02.080
That when the wig goes on and Clarice
comes out and Doris begins to wiggle,

55:02.110 --> 55:04.300
you're gonna be spectacular.

55:19.830 --> 55:21.740
What are you doing here?

55:21.760 --> 55:26.070
Oh. Trying to acquire some
sort of comfort with this room.

55:26.090 --> 55:28.400
It's even bigger than the last one.

55:29.610 --> 55:33.090
I thought you were arguing
very well, right up to…

55:33.530 --> 55:35.600
when you froze.

55:36.230 --> 55:40.290
Jerry, the idea of me trying
this case is utterly ridiculous.

55:40.310 --> 55:43.610
Do you think perhaps you could first chair?

55:43.630 --> 55:45.770
I could, but…

55:45.800 --> 55:47.580
there's a risk.

55:47.610 --> 55:51.570
Sometimes jurors find me…

55:53.830 --> 55:55.610
different.

55:55.630 --> 55:57.160
Why?

56:09.110 --> 56:12.760
Surely you've noticed,
I have a few odd tics.

56:12.780 --> 56:17.466
Well, we all have our tics. Some are
just better disguised than others.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.110
From what I see,

56:23.140 --> 56:26.990
making Joseph Washington
seem human and, if possible, likable,

56:27.030 --> 56:29.330
is our biggest challenge here.

56:29.370 --> 56:32.360
The jury can't help
but be struck by your…

56:32.390 --> 56:35.120
humanity and kindness.

56:35.150 --> 56:37.180
They'll be rooting for you…

56:37.210 --> 56:42.260
and, by association, perhaps him.

56:43.520 --> 56:47.670
I will be right by your side.
Together we can do this.

56:47.700 --> 56:53.780
But Joseph Washington's best chance
is if the face of our defense is you.

56:55.080 --> 56:57.290
Clearly…

56:57.320 --> 57:00.740
he seems to know that.

57:10.590 --> 57:16.180
Okay, our third entry tonight is
a duet coming from two very sexy ladies.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.520
Singing a song from the movie “Hairspray,”

57:18.560 --> 57:25.330
please give a warm King's Row welcome
to Doris Thumper and Clarice Bell.

57:25.360 --> 57:27.890
–Hey, you made it.
–Just in time.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:12.090
<i>I know none of the facts of this case,
I haven't even seen the police report.</i>

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:16.010
<i>But look— is that
a guilty man or what?</i>

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.880
<i>I mean, what kind of society would
presume this animal innocent?</i>

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:23.260
<i>Look at him.
Put me on the jury.</i>

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.670
<i>I'll vote to fry him before
the trial even starts.</i>

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.100
<i>And that reminds me…</i>

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.950
Is this for real?

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:32.860
Most trusted name in news.

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:36.840
<i>Do we really care if they
sizzle a little before dying?</i>

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:41.200
<i>Boo-hoo-hoo. We're talking about
the scum of the earth here,</i>

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.510
<i>and we're supposed to
make it pleasant for them?</i>

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:45.350
<i>Come on.</i>

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:49.110
We're throwing them
to the wolves— Katie and Jerry.

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:54.170
Shirley, even if we did put more lawyers
on it, there's nothing they can do.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:00.900
Carl… I need you
to tread more lightly.

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:04.880
This firm… it's not like
the New York branch.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.690
I could always go back.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.960
You know, Jerry?
He said I'm a poor fit.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.470
I don't want you to go back.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.140
You sure?

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.740
Sure.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.320
What's the occasion?

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.760
I got so… inspired by Clarence's
performance as Clarice,

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:46.720
I decided to… whip out
my Lennon Sisters dress.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.640
Should I put mine on?

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.920
It's not necessary,
I just thought I…

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.190
seize the silliness.

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:52.460
It's good for the heart, you know.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.980
Meanwhile, they made the
semi-finals, Denny.

01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:00.350
It was so… thrilling… for us,
for them, both of them. These two…

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:05.380
terribly shy people, basking
in the spotlight on a stage with…

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:07.520
everybody.

01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:09.880
Forget it.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.970
–I was just looking.
–Well stop looking!

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:14.520
I don't like being… objectified.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.180
Did you know…

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.930
that Shirley Schmidt has
a cheerleading costume?

01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:25.910
Sometimes she puts it on.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.630
Really?

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.330
Can you imagine Shirley
doing a little cheer?

01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:33.380
With a little pleated skirt?
And the white socks?

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.720
All of it.

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.440
Oh, my God.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:41.030
I so often think how…
lucky we are

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.580
to have, as a senior partner,
Shirley Schmidt.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.930
And now in a cheerleading outfit.

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:48.180
We're lucky. Period.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.730
We live good lives.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.070
Yes, we do.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.680
Now, take your day for example.

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:58.270
Sex in an elevator.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.060
Twice.

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:00.830
With a woman not your own.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.750
Help save the environment,
fight global warming,

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:07.628
taking a rocking show after work,
and then…

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:10.600
throw on a dress as a nightcap.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.580
And later I get to
close my eyes and think…

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.740
Of Shirley Schmidt.

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:18.710
In a cheerleading costume.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:21.660
Oh, my God. The little pleated…

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:25.220
All of it.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.820
We live… very good lives.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.170
Indeed… indeed.
