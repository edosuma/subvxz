10:09.957 --> 10:12.350
- So the Holt Tower
trafficking case is now focused

10:12.394 --> 10:14.352
on Congressman Howard's
involvement.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.659
Rosa, Lulu, and Denise
have all disclosed

10:16.703 --> 10:19.096
that Howard paid them
multiple visits.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.142
So, are they all solid?

10:24.449 --> 10:25.929
Guys, is there a problem?

10:25.973 --> 10:28.540
- Lulu's not talking until
she gets her daughter back.

10:28.584 --> 10:31.065
And I don't blame her--she's
already been burned twice.

10:31.108 --> 10:34.590
- I'm working with protective
services on that, Fin.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.159
- And Denise is out.
- Not worth another run?

10:38.202 --> 10:39.377
- No, I mean out.
Out of the city.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.118
Can't find her.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.946
- Okay, that leaves Rosa.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.644
- We promised to
leave her alone,

10:44.687 --> 10:46.689
so she and her son
could have a fresh start.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.692
- We did, but you two have
a good rapport,

10:49.736 --> 10:52.347
so ask her about Howard
and see where it leads.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.401
- Rosa?

11:03.445 --> 11:05.273
- I told you
that you can't be here.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.231
I was on a school field trip.
- I know.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.625
- Pequeño, mijo.
And bring me back my change.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.714
- Look, things are
moving quickly, all right?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.716
We're looking to make a case
against Mr. Howard.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.457
- No.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.155
Your own captain told me
after I helped with Catalina

11:18.199 --> 11:19.591
that I could keep
the apartment.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.680
She said it was over.

11:20.723 --> 11:23.465
- And it is over...for you.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.293
But he's hurting other women.

11:25.336 --> 11:28.383
Raping girls.

11:29.558 --> 11:30.733
- I believe it.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.474
The man's a pig,
the worst of them all.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.694
- We need your help
to put him away.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.609
- By testifying?
Against Howard?

11:37.653 --> 11:40.395
Are you crazy?
You know who he is.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.745
- I do.
But we can protect you.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.313
- Ma!
You want some?

11:45.356 --> 11:46.662
- I have to go.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.316
- Hey, at least
think it over?

11:48.359 --> 11:51.493
- Let me be with my son.

11:55.192 --> 11:58.021
- Are you nuts?

11:58.065 --> 11:59.675
Bad enough I had
to rat out Catalina.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.198
But Howard?

12:01.242 --> 12:02.678
That guy's gonna be
president someday.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.767
Got a machine behind him.
Think they're gonna let

12:04.811 --> 12:06.073
a mamaluke like me
blow that up?

12:06.116 --> 12:07.509
- We can drive you.
Say it's a medical issue.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.337
No one here has to know.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.339
- Grand jury.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.254
I told you already.

12:13.297 --> 12:16.518
I took Howard to Lulu's
apartment, Denise's apartment,

12:16.561 --> 12:18.563
and Rosa's apartment.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.784
- Well--well, now we need you
to testify to that.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.265
[dramatic music]

12:24.308 --> 12:26.484
- How are we doing on the
afterparty for the fundraiser?

12:26.528 --> 12:28.095
I haven't heard back
from Catalina.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.271
- She's working on it.
- Not fast enough.

12:30.314 --> 12:33.056
It's been a busy week,
and we need to unwind.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.146
What about those girls
who interned last summer?

12:36.190 --> 12:37.669
- They were still
in high school, boss.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.802
- Just make sure
they have IDs.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.762
Ooh, the petite blonde.
She was like a colt.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.720
- [chuckles]
Colt's the male horse.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.157
Filly's the female.
- [laughs]

12:47.201 --> 12:48.550
- You getting confused,
partner?

12:48.593 --> 12:51.074
- Well, she was flat
and sleek.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.815
That's all I know.
None of that mama fat.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.208
- Oh, Jenna.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.731
- That's her.
That's my little pony.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.080
- [chuckles]

12:57.124 --> 13:00.040
And her cute friend.
- Hayden.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.694
- So Ortiz needed a law degree
to become a pimp.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.435
- Jenna, how old is she?

13:04.479 --> 13:06.481
- Ortiz said she's a sophomore.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.396
- So high school.
What, 16?

13:08.439 --> 13:10.572
- Yeah, or maybe even 15.

13:10.615 --> 13:13.227
I've got three girls
at Sacred Heart.

13:13.270 --> 13:15.533
God, this makes me sick.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.841
Make sure Ortiz gets
this Jenna to the fundraiser

13:18.885 --> 13:21.670
and catch Howard in the act
and arrest him on-site, okay?

13:21.713 --> 13:23.759
- Um, again, Chief,
the thinking here

13:23.803 --> 13:26.153
is that maybe we let
this play out a bit more.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.589
- Why?

13:27.632 --> 13:29.809
- Well, some of our witnesses
are a bit reluctant.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.854
And we're thinking
if we give them more time--

13:31.898 --> 13:33.725
- Tell your witnesses
to grow a pair.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.336
I want this guy
to go down now.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.338
You understand me?
- With all due respect,

13:37.381 --> 13:39.079
we're only gonna get one shot
at Congressman Howard.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.558
- And the Eighth Floor agrees.

13:40.602 --> 13:43.605
- Yeah, well, they got
no balls, either.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.347
Correct me if I'm wrong,
Counselor,

13:46.390 --> 13:48.740
but as soon as Howard announces
his exploratory committee

13:48.784 --> 13:50.307
for presidency,

13:50.351 --> 13:52.309
then any arrest is gonna
be perceived as political.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.354
Am I right?
- Agreed.

13:53.397 --> 13:54.659
But that's still a ways off.

13:54.703 --> 13:58.141
- What's not is a new mayor.
[phone buzzes]

13:58.185 --> 13:59.403
And after the year
that we've just had,

13:59.447 --> 14:01.101
Howard is the perfect target.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.450
- You mean white?

14:02.493 --> 14:03.930
- And privileged, yeah.

14:03.973 --> 14:07.368
And that is just the kind
of headline that makes us--

14:08.760 --> 14:12.329
Captain, are you with us?

14:12.373 --> 14:14.505
- I'm sorry.

14:14.549 --> 14:15.898
Something's come up.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.205
I have a situation
and I need to leave.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.163
Excuse me.

14:22.557 --> 14:23.819
- Where's the captain?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.343
- Don't know.
Still haven't heard from her.

14:26.387 --> 14:29.564
- That did not feel right,
pressuring Rosa today.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.435
I feel like we're rushing this,
you know?

14:31.479 --> 14:33.176
Maybe she'll talk
to McGrath about it.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.396
- Good luck.

14:35.439 --> 14:38.312
- I know the job is not
supposed to be easy, but...

14:38.355 --> 14:41.706
today is the first day
where it just felt wrong.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.230
You know?

14:43.273 --> 14:45.754
- That's part of the job, too.
You gotta get past that.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.414
- Morales was a cop gone bad.
He was distressed.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.939
Couldn't handle it.

14:56.983 --> 15:00.508
- So what happened next?

15:00.551 --> 15:03.859
- He put a gun to his head.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.905
Sergeant Bell was trying
to talk him down.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.692
- No.
You do not go out this way.

15:10.735 --> 15:13.956
- Ayanna, I need you right now.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.610
- I'm here.
- I need you.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.264
- I'm here.

15:17.307 --> 15:20.267
- Morales finally lowers
his weapon

15:20.310 --> 15:23.226
and we all took a breath.

- You have your--no!
[gunshots]

15:25.925 --> 15:27.578

so quickly.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.363

15:29.406 --> 15:32.235

you want to add?

15:42.942 --> 15:46.249
- No.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.686
- Why were you at the hospital,
Captain Benson?

15:49.905 --> 15:52.560
- I received a text from
Detective Stabler.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.431
But I know now
that he didn't send it.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.912
- How?
- He told me.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.742
- And you have no reason
to doubt him?

16:00.785 --> 16:03.745
- He was my partner for--
for 12 years.

16:03.788 --> 16:07.749
- Then who was it from?
- Richard Wheatley.

16:07.792 --> 16:11.492
It's all part of his vendetta
against Detective Stabler.

16:11.535 --> 16:15.278
Any woman who's close to him
is a target.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.238
- Wheatley wanted to kill you?

16:18.281 --> 16:22.024
- I was run off the road
a week before.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.895
That may have been
a warning shot.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.810
- I'm aware.
But at the hospital,

16:25.854 --> 16:27.682
it was my understanding
he sent Morales

16:27.725 --> 16:29.597
to kill his ex-wife,
Angela Wheatley.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.295
- Or both of us.

16:35.081 --> 16:39.955

Olivia Benson.

Wow.

now I completely understand.

She's a knock out.
Poor Angela, though, huh?

16:49.660 --> 16:52.968
Such a pleasure
to meet you, Liv.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.449

17:06.286 --> 17:08.201
Are we all set up
for Howard's fundraiser?

17:08.244 --> 17:09.680

What is it with these men?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.904
Wheatley, Howard--

17:15.947 --> 17:18.080
- Too much money.
Too much power.

They think they can do
whatever they want.

I tweaked my ankle again.

to the suite with the girls.

17:44.411 --> 17:45.542
We'll do the rest.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.109

rocking him to sleep.

Howard gave me my first job
out of law school.

He's been my friend
since college.

I-I can't do this.

about you.
