All right, all right, let's --
places to start.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.712
You know...
Yes?

00:11.745 --> 00:13.614
Since I'm not Southern...

00:13.647 --> 00:15.616
There are no one-syllable words.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.252
Okay.
Like "too" would be "to-oo."

00:18.286 --> 00:21.789
Anything that's an "E,"
pronounce it as if it's an "AI."

00:21.822 --> 00:24.425
Okay.
Ai.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.394
Ai. Okay.
Ai.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.496
This is like Blanche from
"The Golden Girls"?

00:28.529 --> 00:30.164
Yeah.
Oh, indeed.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.067
Oh, a wonderful interpretation
of your character.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.603
Yes.
I think that was excellent.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.839
We're taking it from Mary Bell's
entrance.

* They're just walking around,

01:02.530 --> 01:06.400
Right now I am on my own
personal gaycation.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.336
Sadly, Ellen couldn't be here
with me,

01:08.369 --> 01:09.770
so I'm going alone on this one.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.573
And I'm road-tripping throughout
the deep South.

01:12.606 --> 01:16.377
I'm going to Mississippi,
Alabama, Louisiana,

01:16.410 --> 01:19.480
Texas, and Georgia.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.882
I'm driving through
the deep South --

01:21.915 --> 01:25.319
the states that originally
formed the Confederacy.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.855
Each of these states has its own
unique identity,

01:27.888 --> 01:31.325
which contributes powerfully and
positively to American culture,

01:31.359 --> 01:34.495
going beyond Southern charm
and hospitality.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.731
At the same time, the region is
highly conservative

01:37.765 --> 01:40.868
and tightly bound to its
traditions of God, guns,

01:40.901 --> 01:42.570
and Southern glory.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.305
These Republican strongholds

01:44.338 --> 01:47.408
have created some of the most
anti-LGBTQ legislation

01:47.441 --> 01:49.210
the country has seen.

01:49.243 --> 01:52.480
But yet the South has a higher
population of LGBTQ people

01:52.513 --> 01:54.848
than any other region
in the nation.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.651
So on this road trip,
I want to talk to

01:57.685 --> 02:01.489
as many people as I can to
understand the LGBTQ experience

02:01.522 --> 02:05.326
here and find out what it means
to be Southern and queer.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.761
I'm starting my trip in Texas,

02:07.795 --> 02:09.897
the biggest state
in the deep South.

02:09.930 --> 02:13.334
And I've come to Austin to meet
someone who considers himself

02:13.367 --> 02:15.803
quintessentially Southern.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.671
Hey, Ian.
How you doing, sir?

02:17.705 --> 02:19.307
I'm pretty --
I'm hot as hell.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.175
What?
Well, welcome to Austin, Texas.

02:21.209 --> 02:24.878
Yeah. Michael Cargill is
pro-gun, pro-God, conservative,

02:24.912 --> 02:26.947
and a proud Gay man.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.582
Well, today we're gonna do
some shooting.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.817
Mm-hmm.
We're actually gonna teach you

02:29.850 --> 02:31.519
how to shoot.
These are your friends?

02:31.552 --> 02:33.421
Yeah, a group of friends
that I drink with,

02:33.454 --> 02:35.223
have fun with.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.890
We actually get a chance to come
out and go shoot.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.193
A lot of them are in the gay
community,

02:39.227 --> 02:40.594
so it's all about LGBT rights

02:40.628 --> 02:42.530
and being able to
defend ourselves

02:42.563 --> 02:44.598
and being proficient with
our firearms.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.304
How you feel?

02:50.338 --> 02:51.772
I get a little nervous,
to be honest.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.541
I don't know what it is.
Well, I mean, I know what it is.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.843
Yeah, it's a gun.
Slide that sucker in there.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.845
There you go. Now, I want you to
take this hand.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.248
I want you to pull it back on
the slide and let it go.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.949
Pull back hard.
Do one shot.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.318
Just pull it all the way.
There you go.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.220
It gets your blood pumping,
let me tell you.

[ Thunder crashing ]
Oh, boy.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.523
Oh, we better run for it.
You guys want to run for it?

03:09.557 --> 03:11.292
Run for it.
I think we should run for it.

What does it mean to you to be
Southern,

03:19.567 --> 03:20.801
or to be from the South?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.870
Hmm. Wow.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.405
[ Sighs ]

03:24.438 --> 03:25.973
Well, it's -- it's Texas.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.642
You know, there's nothing like
Texas -- the Lone Star State.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.411
Right.
You know, where we can carry

03:30.444 --> 03:32.413
a gun inside the Texas
State Capitol.

03:32.446 --> 03:35.449
We can testify before a state
representative about something

03:35.483 --> 03:37.851
that we're passionate about
at the Texas House.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.454
That is about being a Texan.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.256
That's about being from
the South.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.024
You've had a full experience of
being gay in the South,

03:44.057 --> 03:45.659
and what --
what's that been like?

03:45.693 --> 03:47.595
We're in Austin. We can do
whatever we want to do here.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.330
Most of the people here are
liberal.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.764
I'm conservative.
You know, it's hard for me.

03:50.798 --> 03:54.735
It's very hard 'cause I am that
gay black Republican.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.037
And so where did your
conservative values come from?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.506
Was that from your upbringing?

03:58.539 --> 03:59.740
That comes from just being

03:59.773 --> 04:01.475
in the situation that
I've been in...

04:01.509 --> 04:03.577
Mm-hmm.
and living the life
that I've lived.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.580
I've served in the military,
owning my own company.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.382
I like the conservative values.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.017
There are a lot of things about
the conservatives I do not like.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.785
Mm-hmm.
But there are a lot more things

04:11.819 --> 04:13.521
that I like than I dislike.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.357
How do you feel, then, about
laws against LGBT people --

04:16.390 --> 04:18.859
discrimination laws,
religious liberty laws

04:18.892 --> 04:20.994
that are happening
in our country,

04:21.028 --> 04:23.797
which are being pushed upon
states and cities

04:23.831 --> 04:25.466
by Republicans, mainly?

04:25.499 --> 04:27.067
I totally disagree 100%.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.669
Right.
I'm not gonna allow you

04:28.702 --> 04:31.372

Stay out of my bedroom,

04:31.405 --> 04:33.674

the bottom line.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.776
You're -- You're in a loving
relationship.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.044

Cute couple, okay.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.815

04:41.849 --> 04:43.984
what if you wanted to get
married and then

04:44.017 --> 04:45.519
you vote Republican and then

04:45.553 --> 04:47.655
that right is stripped away
from you?

04:47.688 --> 04:49.390
What do you say to that?

04:49.423 --> 04:51.425
Because a gun's not gonna help
you in that scenario.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.793
And then I have to be fair...
Uh-huh.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.395

Wow.

So we actually --
We argue about this at home.

arguments.

tension, yeah.

So we do argue at home.

argue about?

Yes, "Who are you
gonna vote for?"

You know, "No, we shouldn't do
this," or, "We should do that."

05:10.010 --> 05:12.746
So we can agree to disagree on a
lot of things without being

05:12.780 --> 05:15.449
disagreeable, and we can make
sure that this country does

05:15.483 --> 05:18.018
the right thing by making sure
that our elected officials do

05:18.051 --> 05:19.720
the things they need to do.
Mm-hmm.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.889

right or too far to the left.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.524
Right.
That is up to you.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.993
That is up to me to make sure
that we do do that.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.462
But in the deep South, are
things straying

05:28.496 --> 05:30.130
a little too far to the right?

05:30.163 --> 05:34.134

influence in the region

campaigning against

a liberal outpost,

the Southern states

06:05.833 --> 06:07.568
are so politically conservative,

06:07.601 --> 06:09.770
so I'm meeting with Wendy Davis,

06:09.803 --> 06:12.673
a former Democratic state
senator, to learn more.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.476
She's invited me over for
a cookout, obviously.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.711
And this is where
we have our fire going.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.146
All right.
All right?

Grilling is a Texas thing.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.750
Yeah?
Smoking is a Texas thing.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.853
In 2013, Wendy Davis made
national headlines

06:25.886 --> 06:28.656
when she endured
an 11-hour filibuster

06:28.689 --> 06:31.158
and protest of
an anti-abortion bill

06:31.191 --> 06:34.528
which would have closed
healthcare facilities in Texas.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.798
This legislation would have not
only denied many women

06:37.831 --> 06:40.634
access to healthcare, but also
LGBTQ people

06:40.668 --> 06:42.436
who relied on these clinics.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.639
She also co-authored some of
the state's first

06:45.673 --> 06:47.708
LGBTQ non-discrimination bills,

06:47.741 --> 06:51.479
solidifying her reputation as
an ally to the community.

06:51.512 --> 06:56.550
I wanted to talk about Texas
and why so many

06:56.584 --> 06:58.886
conservative politicians
come from Texas,

06:58.919 --> 07:01.021
and why they have so much
influence.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.056
Ultra-conservative voices
in Texas

07:03.090 --> 07:05.192
are rewarded by voters
who show up...

07:05.225 --> 07:06.860
Mm.
...and vote for them.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.897
The people who are leading
the state right now

07:09.930 --> 07:15.836
come to understand that
advancing hateful rhetoric,

07:15.869 --> 07:18.506
discriminatory laws...
Mm-hmm.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.541
...it's what keeps them
in office.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.910
Disrespecting
the Supreme Court's

07:22.943 --> 07:24.712
marriage equality opinion

07:24.745 --> 07:27.648
and the discriminatory
perspective about

07:27.681 --> 07:31.084
transgender people,
a lot of the politicians

07:31.118 --> 07:35.122
feel like they can't be loud
enough on those issues.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.792
So, how do you see what's
happening to women's rights

07:38.826 --> 07:40.794
affecting the LGBTQ community?

07:40.828 --> 07:46.166
In 2015, the Texas legislature,
in its infinite wisdom,

07:46.199 --> 07:50.938
pulled all HIV screen funding
from Planned Parenthood.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.073
Mm.
Planned Parenthood was

07:53.106 --> 07:56.610
the largest provider of HIV
screens in the state.

07:56.644 --> 08:00.013
So with it follows
the possibility of

08:00.047 --> 08:04.017
a healthcare crisis with
an increase in HIV

08:04.051 --> 08:06.687
purely to gain
political points.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.155
So think about that
for a moment.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.123
We're talking about politicians

08:10.157 --> 08:11.992
who are making decisions

08:12.025 --> 08:15.128
that they know are going to put
people's health in jeopardy,

08:15.162 --> 08:16.930
and they do it anyway.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.600
Mm.
Wendy leaves a legacy of Texas

08:19.633 --> 08:22.269
state's first anti-LGBTQ
bullying bill

08:22.302 --> 08:25.939
and continues her advocacy by
empowering younger generations.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.107
Hi. I'm Ian.
Hey.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.709
How's it going?
Nice to meet you.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.243
Let's high five.
I like the high five.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.546
High five.
So I'm meeting with some teens

08:32.580 --> 08:34.915
from Out Youth, a local
organization that provides

08:34.948 --> 08:37.651
a safe space for young people to
get their thoughts on

08:37.685 --> 08:39.920
being LGBTQ in the South.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.023
[ Laughs ]

08:43.056 --> 08:45.025
As young Americans in the South,

08:45.058 --> 08:49.062
I'm wondering what you think are
the biggest issues of your time.

08:49.096 --> 08:53.667
A lot of people -- You know,
they feel like they're inferior

08:53.701 --> 08:55.703
some way, somehow.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.304
Everyone deserves a safe space
to learn

08:57.337 --> 08:58.972
and a safe space to walk
the halls.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.874
I mean, are you worried about
when you use the restroom?

09:00.908 --> 09:02.810
Is that a daily concern for you?
Yeah. Every day.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.078
It triggers anxiety, and it's
just like, "Oh, my gosh."

09:05.112 --> 09:07.080
So I'm always like, "Got to go
to the bathroom

09:07.114 --> 09:08.882
before I leave the house,
especially if

09:08.916 --> 09:11.051
we're going somewhere for, like,
more than an hour."

09:11.084 --> 09:13.353
Yeah, same.
And then when I do use, like,

09:13.386 --> 09:16.790
the bathroom, it's like I go
inside the women's bathroom,

09:16.824 --> 09:20.093
and I'm just like, "I don't --
Like, this feels so wrong."

09:20.127 --> 09:23.030
How do you both feel about
gender and sexuality

09:23.063 --> 09:24.832
and putting labels on things?

09:24.865 --> 09:30.003
I mean, I'm pretty simple
female-to-male and pansexual.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.239
Mm-hmm.
So I'm more so

09:32.272 --> 09:34.675
just attracted to people by
their personality.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.276
I'm pretty simple, as well.

09:36.309 --> 09:40.848
Female-to-male trans guy,
and pansexual, as well.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.850
And is that -- Is that a part of
the conversation

09:42.883 --> 09:44.317
between your group of friends?

09:44.351 --> 09:47.655
I mean, usually, it's, like,
upon first meeting somebody,

09:47.688 --> 09:50.958
you would be like, "Hey, what
are your name and pronouns?"

09:50.991 --> 09:53.727
I'm really bad at, like, other
gender-neutral pronouns.

09:53.761 --> 09:58.832
So I, like, try my best "zes"
and "zir" pronouns, but, yeah.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.067
Yeah, I've never heard of
that one.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.802
Younger kids are using "ze"?

10:01.835 --> 10:03.303
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.372
Well, basically, instead of
saying something like,

10:05.405 --> 10:07.808
"He's over there," you'd be
like, "Ze's over there."

10:07.841 --> 10:09.910
I feel like you have
a lot of faith

10:09.943 --> 10:11.344
in your fellow young folks.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.380
Do you have hope in
our politics?

10:13.413 --> 10:16.016
Honestly, it's kind of hard
to tell.

10:16.049 --> 10:22.956
It more so depends on how much
of an uproar,

10:22.990 --> 10:25.726
like, we as a society make...

10:25.759 --> 10:27.427
Mm-hmm.
...and if they choose to listen.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.031
I've only just started my trip,
and Texas is already expanding

10:31.064 --> 10:34.167
my perspective of not only what
it means to be Southern

10:34.201 --> 10:36.169
but also queer.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.305
Next stop -- Louisiana.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.910
I'm Ian Daniel.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.878
I'm in the swamps of Louisiana
right now.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.180
And this is
"Gaycation: Deep South."

10:47.214 --> 10:49.717
Hey, you guys.
I'm in the Bayou.

10:49.750 --> 10:53.120
I've left Texas, and I'm making
my way through Louisiana

10:53.153 --> 10:57.157
to find out what it's like to be
LGBTQ in this part of the South.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.060
For my first night out, I'm
headed straight for New Orleans,

11:00.093 --> 11:03.897
a Mecca for gay tourists
and the home of Sissy Bounce.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.833
**

11:05.866 --> 11:09.136
Sissy Bounce is a local subgenre
of rap that's flourished

11:09.169 --> 11:14.074
in the post-Katrina
queer community.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.308
Hey.
How you doing?

11:15.342 --> 11:17.077
I'm meeting up with Roe,

11:17.110 --> 11:19.880
a legendary bounce dancer who's
taking me to the Vibe.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.915
We're going to go have fun.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.384
You're gonna see
the style of dance

11:24.417 --> 11:27.855
that I like to actually release
my feelings in.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.389
Yeah.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.058
Yeah.
You put your feelings into it.

11:31.091 --> 11:35.062
Yeah. The reason I do it is
because I'm not a person

11:35.095 --> 11:36.964
that expresses myself a lot.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.866
And by me holding my things in,

11:38.899 --> 11:41.334
dance was always the reliever
from it, so...

11:41.368 --> 11:43.436
Do you identify as a gay man,
or what -- how do you --

11:43.470 --> 11:45.238
how do you identify?
I'm not going to say

11:45.272 --> 11:48.876
I identify as a gay man or as
a queer or none of that.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.277
I identify as me.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.212
Whatever comes my way,
whatever floats my boat,

11:52.245 --> 11:53.847
if I want to take it,
I'll take it.

11:53.881 --> 11:54.848
That's just me being me.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.516
Love it.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.451
Let's go inside.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.894
* Hands on the wall,
hands on the wall *

12:06.927 --> 12:08.261
* Here you go,
hands on your ankle *

12:08.295 --> 12:09.863
* Hands on your ankle,
here you go *

12:09.897 --> 12:12.265
The Vibe is one of the first
and possibly last

12:12.299 --> 12:14.501
remaining Sissy Bounce clubs
in the city,

12:14.534 --> 12:16.770
and a place where
young queer people

12:16.804 --> 12:19.773
can make a name for themselves
as dancers on the scene.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.775
* Turn it up

12:21.809 --> 12:24.244
* That was hot

12:24.277 --> 12:26.179
So, you own the place.
Yeah.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.015
And what is this place, exactly?

12:28.048 --> 12:30.984
It's the Vibe. It's the bounce
night, gay night.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.820
From your point of view,
what is bounce?

12:32.853 --> 12:37.490
Well, it's a lot of them
expressing themselves

12:37.524 --> 12:40.493
on the mirror, on the --
on the floor --

12:40.527 --> 12:43.296
anywhere they can catch it.
They just catch that beat.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.498
Right.
It's a beat that

12:45.532 --> 12:47.267
makes them go crazy.
Makes them move.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.469
And you would say that your
club's really important to

12:49.502 --> 12:51.538
the LGBT community around here?
Yes, yes.

12:51.571 --> 12:56.109
And why is it important you have
a space for the LGBTQ community?

12:56.143 --> 13:00.047
Well, because I am also gay,

13:00.080 --> 13:03.984
and I like what I feel
when I'm in there.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.319
I love to see these kids
get out here.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.356
I'd rather them do that than do
something else bad

13:09.389 --> 13:11.291
on the street.
You know what I'm saying?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.226
Yeah.
So for me, it's --

13:13.260 --> 13:14.862
it's like a blessing.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.129
We had an amazing time.
Ohh.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.965
It's so cool you have this
place.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.871
Notably, New Orleans has the
fourth-largest gay population

13:23.904 --> 13:26.806
in the country, but after
the party is over...

13:29.209 --> 13:31.979
Across the South, HIV rates are
on the rise,

13:32.012 --> 13:34.882
and according to a recent report
from the CDC,

13:34.915 --> 13:37.184
Louisiana has
the second-highest rate

13:37.217 --> 13:40.153
of new diagnoses in the country.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.623
I'm in Shreveport to learn more
and to try to understand why

13:43.656 --> 13:46.459
one out of seven people with HIV
in the state

13:46.493 --> 13:48.361
are unaware of their status.

13:48.395 --> 13:52.299
The Philadelphia Center is one
of the only HIV support centers

13:52.332 --> 13:55.268
of its kind serving
Northern Louisiana.

13:55.302 --> 13:59.006
I'm joining a local support
group for HIV-positive people

13:59.039 --> 14:00.573
and their allies.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.877
We can start talking about,
maybe, some of the stigma

14:03.911 --> 14:07.347
attached to HIV and maybe how
it's been difficult for you guys

14:07.380 --> 14:10.183
in the past and how, maybe,
things are different now.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.119
I was diagnosed
back in the '80s,

14:12.152 --> 14:14.554
when the first epidemic started.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.224
And over the years, it's --
it's been a struggle.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.193
I've lost three long-term
partners, and that's been tough.

14:20.227 --> 14:24.097
But the good news is it's become
a manageable disease,

14:24.131 --> 14:26.299
where we can just live on our
medications,

14:26.333 --> 14:29.069
and if we're diligent and we
keep our regimen going,

14:29.102 --> 14:31.071
we're gonna --
we're gonna survive this.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.473
You know, my biggest fear
was being rejected.

14:33.506 --> 14:37.044
When I finally came to terms
myself with it, I was like,

14:37.077 --> 14:39.212
"Screw everybody else,"
you know?

14:39.246 --> 14:42.082
If they -- They're either gonna
like me, or they're not.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.251
I'm thinking about education
in schools,

14:44.284 --> 14:46.686
and maybe you can talk to me
more about what --

14:46.719 --> 14:49.522
what's in place in --
in the state and in the South.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.491
Not a lot. You know, they do
call it the Bible Belt

14:51.524 --> 14:53.493
for a reason.
Right.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.429
We teach a lot of
abstinence-only down here,

14:56.463 --> 14:59.266
which has really been proven not
to work.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.101
People are going to have sex.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.303
And then on another level,
we are a criminalization state,

15:03.336 --> 15:06.406
to where you can be criminalized
for having sex with somebody

15:06.439 --> 15:08.441
and not telling them you're
positive.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.578
So then you have occasions of
people knowing they might

15:11.611 --> 15:14.547
potentially be positive,
not getting tested because

15:14.581 --> 15:17.150
they don't want that
criminalization to be

15:17.184 --> 15:18.986
following them in the system.

15:19.019 --> 15:22.222
So, I mean, it's just --
Fundamentally, the way things

15:22.255 --> 15:25.625
are run is probably why our
numbers are so high down here.

15:25.658 --> 15:29.562
DANIEL: And according to the
CDC, if HIV infection rates

15:29.596 --> 15:33.033
persist, half of all gay black
men in the U.S.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.303
will be diagnosed with HIV
in their lifetime.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.205
[ Doorbell rings ]

15:38.238 --> 15:40.307
But this doesn't have to be
the case.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.374
Hey.
Hello.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.210
I'm meeting with
Chance and Josh,

15:43.243 --> 15:46.079
a young couple who are living
together and staying healthy

15:46.113 --> 15:47.747
in a mixed-status relationship.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.518
Chance has an undetectable viral
load due to daily medication,

15:51.551 --> 15:54.554
and Josh is on a course of drugs
referred to as PrEP

15:54.587 --> 15:57.557
that keeps his risk of exposure
very low.

15:57.590 --> 16:01.394
How exactly did you find out
you were HIV-positive?

16:01.428 --> 16:03.596
He wanted to do a blood drive.
So it was like --

16:03.630 --> 16:05.398
It was the National Gay
Blood Drive.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.234
Like, it slightly crossed my
mind, like,

16:07.267 --> 16:09.002
"Oh, what if I do have
something?"

16:09.036 --> 16:11.704
And then she called us in, she
turned around and she was like,

16:11.738 --> 16:13.240
"You just came back positive."

16:13.273 --> 16:14.674
And I was like,
"Now I got to go tell Josh."

16:14.707 --> 16:16.476
And I couldn't tell him
'cause I was crying.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.078
He was like,
"Well, what's wrong?"

16:18.111 --> 16:20.113
And I was like, "My test results
came back positive."

16:20.147 --> 16:21.448
And he was sitting there
for a second.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.749
He was like,
"Well, let's go get mine

16:22.782 --> 16:24.551
and see if they come back
positive."

16:24.584 --> 16:26.753
I was like, "I'm going in there,
and I'm gonna be positive."

16:26.786 --> 16:29.222
I went in there, and she's like,
"You're negative."

16:29.256 --> 16:30.790
I'm like, "Oh, wait.
Test me again.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.692
I know I'm positive.
I got to be."

16:32.725 --> 16:34.461
What has this done to your
relationship?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.363
When you found out
you're HIV positive

16:36.396 --> 16:38.531
and that you were negative, you
lucked out, but what happened?

16:38.565 --> 16:40.733
Yeah, our relationship, like,
got like 10 times stronger

16:40.767 --> 16:43.536
'cause when you love someone
unconditionally,

16:43.570 --> 16:46.239
a health issue
shouldn't break y'all apart.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.675
That was why I proposed to him
six months later.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.478
Had you heard much about HIV
before this experience?

16:51.511 --> 16:54.114
No.
What did you know about it?

16:54.147 --> 16:57.084
That's why I was so mad 'cause
all I knew was that it was HIV,

16:57.117 --> 17:01.154
there was no cure, and that
it turns into AIDS.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.290
'Cause that's the first thing
I asked her when she said it.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.125
I was like, "How long am I gonna
be alive?"

17:05.158 --> 17:09.096
Because it's painted in this way
that's, like, so fatalistic...

17:09.129 --> 17:11.298
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
...and a death disease.

17:11.331 --> 17:14.301
That's what people don't, like,
understand is nowadays

17:14.334 --> 17:16.169
HIV is not
a death sentence anymore.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.737
No.
Like, nobody should be dying

17:17.770 --> 17:19.272
because of this anymore.
Like...

17:19.306 --> 17:20.773
Mm-hmm.
Mnh-mnh.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.309
And a lot of people are --

17:22.342 --> 17:24.577
aren't really scared about
getting tested.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.746
They're scared to find out
the results.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.615
And --
And you're going today.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.483
Mm-hmm.
And I will go with you.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.086
You're gonna get tested with me?
Yeah, I'll get tested with you.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.656
**

17:39.726 --> 17:41.794
WOMAN: May I help you?
We're here to get tested.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.296
Okay.
Hold on one second.

17:43.330 --> 17:46.499
So, we're both here
for an HIV test?

17:46.533 --> 17:47.734
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.302
We do have a new test.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.703
It takes 20 minutes.
Mm-hmm.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.539
It's the same finger stick.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.707
If I've had sex
in the last 10 days,

17:54.741 --> 17:56.676
when should I get tested again?

17:56.709 --> 18:00.180
To get a true negative,
we suggest a month.

18:00.213 --> 18:03.483
Okay.
Before it clots.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.719
I need a non-texting finger.

18:06.753 --> 18:11.558
It did it that time.
You have 5 1/2 minutes.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.193
I'm going to stand
out here for a minute.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.827
I just don't feel like I should,
like, look at it.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.264
Do you get tested a lot?
I do get tested a lot.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.632
I'm like, "Hey, I'm around it
all the time."

18:19.666 --> 18:20.867
Yeah, no, that's smart.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.635
Ready for your results?

18:22.669 --> 18:26.139
Yeah.
Okay, here we go.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.675
You have a negative test result.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.377
So you are negative for HIV.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.911
All right.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.813
And you're negative for HIV,
as well.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.916
DANIEL: My question is now that
I've come up with the negative

18:36.949 --> 18:39.386
and I'm not on PrEP
but I'm interested in it,

18:39.419 --> 18:41.621
I mean, what's the next step
for -- for me?

18:41.654 --> 18:45.292
Your first step is to find a
physician that'll prescribe it.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.294
You have to be HIV-negative.
Right.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.429
And you have to test
once every three months.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.164
I have a brochure...
Mm-hmm.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.300
that I'll grab you here in the
hallway.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.467
Okay, well, thank you. Yeah.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.203
Let's grab some condoms on
the way out.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.737
Okay. Do you get people in here
just take them all,

18:57.770 --> 18:59.506
like I'm doing right now?
That's a cute one.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.907
I'm gonna do my limit of,
like...

19:00.940 --> 19:03.276
That's what they're here for.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.677
All right, cool.
You sure you don't need more?

19:04.711 --> 19:07.447
[ Laughs ]

19:07.480 --> 19:09.416
It's...

19:09.449 --> 19:12.452
We love sharing our story
because I think that

19:12.485 --> 19:15.622
if you don't, then the stigma
just gets stronger.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.325
Yeah.
And removing the stigma

19:18.358 --> 19:19.926
is the first step.

19:19.959 --> 19:23.530
Chance and Josh affirm that with
access to information

19:23.563 --> 19:26.766
and healthcare, we will one day
beat this disease.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.875
Okay, we're gonna be able to
cross in a minute.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.810
Think we can make it?
Sure, if he hits me,

19:37.844 --> 19:39.546
it'll just get --
I'll be road kill.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.548
I'll do more damage to it
than it will to me.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.916
Yeah, can you stand right here?
And we'll just skip along.

19:43.950 --> 19:47.454
Y'all can see it's in
the middle of a road.

19:47.487 --> 19:51.224
At least they had enough decency
to move around it

19:51.258 --> 19:54.761
because there's a lot of our
history that's being bulled over

19:54.794 --> 19:56.996
just because people
think they can.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.965
Mm-hmm.
I would like for you
to say a prayer,

19:58.998 --> 20:00.800
if you don't mind.
All right.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.669
You want to say the prayer?

20:02.702 --> 20:05.538
A young Confederate's prayer.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.407
I wondered
if God would forgive me

20:07.440 --> 20:08.841
for the men that I have killed.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.643
Would he understand the reason

20:10.677 --> 20:13.380
I was fighting for my freedom
of my homeland.

20:13.413 --> 20:16.383
Before I go to sleep forever,
I pray put a Rebel flag

20:16.416 --> 20:19.419
on my grave because I died for
the love of the South.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.588
Will you pray for me?
Amen.

20:24.457 --> 20:27.327
DANIEL: The deep South is
experiencing what some call

20:27.360 --> 20:30.397
the Confederate Spring, as
ultra-conservative Tea Partiers

20:30.430 --> 20:32.532
gain influence in the region.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.567
I'm making my way into
Mississippi,

20:34.601 --> 20:37.870
which is one of a few Southern
states whose flag still contains

20:37.904 --> 20:39.672
Confederate imagery.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.975
It's a symbol of heritage to
some but a daily reminder

20:43.009 --> 20:45.345
of systemic oppression
to others.

20:45.378 --> 20:48.881
Just before I arrived, the last
segregated schools in the state

20:48.915 --> 20:52.385
are being ordered to integrate
by the Federal Government.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.488
And this is the same state
responsible for passing

20:55.522 --> 20:58.325
the nation's harshest
legislation targeting

20:58.358 --> 21:00.560
the LGBTQ community.

21:00.593 --> 21:04.864
Since blocked, House Bill 1523
would have allowed any persons

21:04.897 --> 21:08.301
or businesses to discriminate
solely based on sexuality

21:08.335 --> 21:09.802
or gender identity.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.505
But right now I'm going to a
town that largely opposed

21:12.539 --> 21:14.441
the Confederacy.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.810
I came upon this small town
called Natchez, Mississippi,

21:17.844 --> 21:19.812
and it's really cute and it
seems very

21:19.846 --> 21:21.348
all-American Southern.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.383
And we Googled it to see what it
was like,

21:23.416 --> 21:25.552
and it said it's the birthplace
of Mississippi.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.421
But it also said in a local
newspaper -- one resident said

21:28.455 --> 21:32.659
that after midnight,
all men turn gay in Natchez.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.061
So let's find out
if that's true.

21:35.094 --> 21:41.033
* Y'all come out, come out, my
dears, to lavender country *

21:41.067 --> 21:42.802
* Sashay out and give our a way
a try *

21:42.835 --> 21:44.504
I want to meet a queer
Mississippian,

21:44.537 --> 21:47.440
and there's no gay bars here.
So...

21:47.474 --> 21:50.543
MAN: These are all the period
dresses.

21:50.577 --> 21:53.946
This is Layne Taylor,
the artistic director

21:53.980 --> 21:56.349
of the Natchez Little Theatre.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.884
Mm-hmm.
You haven't lived

21:57.917 --> 21:59.652
until you've tried on
a hoop skirt.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.355
And he's cast me as
his leading lady.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.723
Okay.
We won't put you in

22:03.756 --> 22:05.358
the pantalettes
of the period...

22:05.392 --> 22:07.093
Well...
because they were crotch-less.

22:07.126 --> 22:10.096
All right, this is ladies'
wardrobe storage.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.064
And this is our prop room.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.800
This is our makeup room,

22:13.833 --> 22:17.069
where we keep our wigs,
a lot of women's blouses.

22:17.103 --> 22:20.607
If you'll just hold the --
put your -- Yeah, perfect.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.075
Here we go.
Those bangs are a little short.

22:23.109 --> 22:26.012
I actually know what I'm doing,
believe it or not.

22:26.045 --> 22:29.416
Lovely.
You're a natural beauty.

22:29.449 --> 22:32.018
She looks -- She looks like
she's a little bit lopsided,

22:32.051 --> 22:33.920
but that might be part of
her thing.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.555
It could be.
She's a little messy.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.390
She could have been in
an accident.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.492
She could have fallen going
under the hill for cocktails.

Okay.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.129
Look at those lovely hips.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.931
Oh.
And that is natural.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.566
Popping that booty.
I want you to know

22:46.599 --> 22:48.067
we did not use a bustle
in this production.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.802
Money, money, money.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.871
I love it.
All right, let's go.

Layne revives historic plays
about the antebellum South.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.886
Before he took over the theater
in 2001,

23:06.919 --> 23:09.589
actors were still performing
in blackface.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.691
He immediately changed that,

23:11.724 --> 23:14.527
ushering in a new era where
parts are cast

23:14.561 --> 23:17.096
regardless of race, gender,
or sexuality.

23:17.129 --> 23:20.132
Oh, played fabulously!

Brava! Brava, diva!

Brava, diva!

23:25.037 --> 23:26.673
Oh, fabulous!

23:26.706 --> 23:29.809
Just think of the plays you
could do here,

23:29.842 --> 23:33.546
starring Ian.
Ian as Jezebel.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.914
Is that a play?
I know that's a movie.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.783
I'm imagining it.
[ Laughs ]

23:36.816 --> 23:39.018
I don't know what the hell's
going on in Natchez?

23:39.051 --> 23:40.587
I don't really know
much about Natchez.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.089
Let me tell you.
It's one of the oldest

23:43.122 --> 23:45.458
settlements on
the Mississippi River.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.594
We're celebrating
our 300th birthday.

23:47.627 --> 23:50.062
We didn't participate in
the Civil War.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.765
We were Union-sympathetic.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.568
We voted against secession
from the Union.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.804
Would you say that it's
a gay-friendly city?

23:57.837 --> 24:00.673
I, in all honesty,

24:00.707 --> 24:04.911
believe Natchez was a
gay-friendly city 300 years ago.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.613
Mm-hmm.
I've been in and out of Natchez

24:06.646 --> 24:08.047
all of my life.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.949
Gay life is
what you make it here.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.851
And it's accepted.
What about Mississippi?

24:11.884 --> 24:13.620
Because, um...
Yeah.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.254
I mean, Mississippi now --
you would say it's becoming

24:15.287 --> 24:17.624
more conservative, and what does
that -- what does that mean

24:17.657 --> 24:19.058
to L--
for LGBT people?

24:19.091 --> 24:21.861
Well, I-I-I think we've gone
about as low as we can go.

24:21.894 --> 24:25.698
I do not understand why
the population of the state

24:25.732 --> 24:27.800
elects people that don't have

24:27.834 --> 24:30.603
the interests of the people
at heart.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.640
See, I do have issues with that.
I don't like hypocrisy.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.141
Right.
As Ms. Sugarbaker

24:35.174 --> 24:37.176
in "Designing Women" said...
Yeah.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.946
"We love our skeletons
in our closet.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.649
We bring them out
and rattle them."

24:42.682 --> 24:44.951
I mean, that's the way
it should be.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.719
I had such an amazing time.

24:46.753 --> 24:49.589
Layne revels in rattling
the long-held traditions

24:49.622 --> 24:51.858
of the South, but if you look
closely,

24:51.891 --> 24:54.093
he doesn't just make plays.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.295
By reclaiming
Southern literature,

24:56.328 --> 24:58.798
he gives voice to the many
narratives that make up

24:58.831 --> 25:01.568
the true diversity
of the deep South.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.844
DANIEL: I'm making my way
through the deep South,

and going to a lesbian-only
community that's been hidden

25:16.315 --> 25:18.551
in the woods for almost
20 years.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.753
And to keep it that way,

25:20.787 --> 25:23.022
they've asked that we not
reveal their location.

25:23.055 --> 25:28.595
All right, so, I don't know
where I'm going.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.763
I think that's the point.

You're chic! Yeah, you're,

You're, like, woods-chic.

Woodsy-chic, yeah.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.047
That's me, yeah.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.750
They've been gracious enough to
invite me on their land

25:50.783 --> 25:53.152
but are putting me to work
clearing some brush.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.321
You've lived through a lot.
You've -- You've seen a lot.

25:55.354 --> 25:58.925
So what is the difference
between coming out in the '70s,

25:58.958 --> 26:00.893
coming out now?
You know, when I came out

26:00.927 --> 26:03.329
in the '70s, the group that I
came into in Charleston

26:03.362 --> 26:05.798
was fighting for women to have
the right to have

26:05.832 --> 26:07.299
a credit card in their own name.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.670
Hello. Women couldn't have a
credit card in their own name.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.304
Uh-huh.
They oftentimes couldn't own

26:12.338 --> 26:14.841
the property that was theirs
that they brought into

26:14.874 --> 26:16.075
a marriage.
I mean, it --

26:16.108 --> 26:18.377
it seems it's just
a short lifetime ago

26:18.410 --> 26:20.112
that these things were true.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.882
And we've built a retreat
space for lesbians.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.117
They came from all over
the country,

26:25.151 --> 26:27.019
and they called it
Lesbian Heaven.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.855
What do you think about the --

26:28.888 --> 26:31.958
I think -- the lesbian community
now, or the younger generation

26:31.991 --> 26:33.993
of women coming up in
the movement --

26:34.026 --> 26:35.828
Mm-hmm. Bless them.
Bless them.

26:35.862 --> 26:39.131
Meaning what?
I'm very proud of the lesbians

26:39.165 --> 26:41.333
now and so glad that they have

26:41.367 --> 26:43.035
the opportunities that
they have.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.671
And we fought hard for that.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.006
There are 18 women living in
this community,

26:47.039 --> 26:49.341
and they come here from all over
the country

26:49.375 --> 26:51.711
to create a society closer to
the land.

26:58.685 --> 26:59.952
Aw.
It's good to meet you.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.120
Thanks for having me.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.889
I lived in Florida in an area

27:02.922 --> 27:06.092
where you really didn't want to
come out too much, okay?

27:06.125 --> 27:09.295
And even though you don't want
to come out too much up here,

27:09.328 --> 27:11.798
either, it was a different
type of peace.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.900
What about around here?
'Cause driving in,

27:13.933 --> 27:16.335
I saw probably like three
or four Confederate flags.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.970
Oh, yeah.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.807
And does that influence
what's going on here?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.442
Or does that influence how you
interact with your community?

27:23.475 --> 27:26.212
My feeling is that I've come
into this area

27:26.245 --> 27:29.115
where this is the precedent
here of how it is.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.851
And it is right-wing,
and it is conservative.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.687
So my thing is to come in
and quietly be a help

27:34.721 --> 27:36.355
and be an influence.
And I am.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.758
Mm-hmm.
I work with a local church

27:38.791 --> 27:41.794

Mm.

And more people are beginning
to know that I am gay.

DANIEL: Spending time in a queer
utopia in the woods makes me

27:59.045 --> 28:01.781
want to stay all day, but I got
to hit the road...

28:01.814 --> 28:03.349
Bye.

28:09.121 --> 28:13.793
...and make it to my next
stop -- Atlanta, Georgia.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.429
And what better way to roll into
town than with

28:17.463 --> 28:19.899
an all-lesbian motorcycle club?

28:22.301 --> 28:25.371
They call themselves
the Fat Bottom Girls.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.373
That was fun.
Welcome to helmet head.

Helmet head? I think it's
kind of a good look for me.

I like it.

Fat Bottom Girls in 2008.

You know what happens after

28:35.381 --> 28:36.816
you break up with somebody
and it's been

28:36.849 --> 28:38.350
one of those kinds of
break-ups?

28:38.384 --> 28:40.186
And you're like, "Oh, my God,
I've got to start my life

all over again, do it all
different."

28:41.888 --> 28:43.823
So I started a meet-up.

* Walk, walk, walk

rationale for both

and encouraging
progressive reform.

* I want you to walk

and social guidance on today's
most pressing issues,

32:12.464 --> 32:15.134
like LGBTQ rights.

32:15.167 --> 32:18.670
While there's some churches that
are making progressive strides,

as a sin.

But just because some churches
don't accept gay people

doesn't mean that there aren't

against social stigma,

he comes to you and says,

Were you scared?

been someone bothering him.

came out, my biggest fear

35:09.875 --> 35:12.311
became someone bothering
you because you're gay.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.812

You know, so...

35:13.845 --> 35:15.814
Let's talk about the incident.

to be going through.

35:22.821 --> 35:27.459

touching it right now?

No, it doesn't hurt, but it
actually, like --

36:49.475 --> 36:50.809
Like, say somebody
gives me a hug,

Be careful,
but do not live in fear.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.602
Mm-hmm.
Don't let that fear stop you

37:16.635 --> 37:20.439
from -- from living,
from being who you are

37:20.472 --> 37:22.040
or who you want to be.

37:29.415 --> 37:30.949
Officer King.
All right, Officer King, so...

37:30.982 --> 37:33.985
DANIEL: I'm in Atlanta, Georgia,
where the police force

37:34.019 --> 37:36.322
is now taking some steps
to deal with

37:36.355 --> 37:38.457
violence against
the LGBTQ community.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.393
Let's take it to the streets.
All right.

37:41.427 --> 37:45.030
I'm on a ride-along with
Officer Eric King,

37:45.063 --> 37:47.633
Atlanta P.D.'s LGBTQ liaison.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.736
Wow, you're giving me the gay
tour of Hot-lanta right now.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.339
Yeah.
From a cop in a uniform.

37:53.372 --> 37:57.643
why do you think Georgia, which
seems to not be that progressive

37:57.676 --> 37:59.611
in terms of laws for
LGBT people,

37:59.645 --> 38:01.880
would have this kind of
program in place?

38:01.913 --> 38:04.716
Atlanta has always been
this black-gay Mecca.

38:04.750 --> 38:09.821
They've had to evolve in order
to support the LGBT community.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.924
You know, Georgia -- We don't
have any hate crime laws,

38:12.958 --> 38:17.329
and we actively have hate crimes
occurring on a daily basis.

38:17.363 --> 38:20.732
Mm-hmm.
And now trans women of color

38:20.766 --> 38:25.070
are the number-one victims
of abuse.

38:25.103 --> 38:28.474
That's interesting that you --
You're a liaison with

38:28.507 --> 38:31.810
the LGBT community, but I think
in the trans community,

38:31.843 --> 38:35.514
especially, there is a stigma
around police officers.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.916
And I'm wondering how do they
feel about you coming around?

38:37.949 --> 38:40.419
Do they -- Do they feel like
you're there to help them,

38:40.452 --> 38:42.120
or do they feel threatened
by your presence?

38:42.153 --> 38:46.725
Well, it's always have to get
past the uniform first.

38:46.758 --> 38:50.362
Right.
The rainbow is a sigh of relief

38:50.396 --> 38:52.964
just because they know they
don't have to go on the defense

38:52.998 --> 38:54.733
so much.
Mm-hmm.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.503
They still have reservations
because I am a police officer,

38:57.536 --> 38:59.838
but the conversation --
the tone of the conversation

38:59.871 --> 39:01.640
goes differently.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.909
Atlanta may be taking
some steps forward,

39:03.942 --> 39:05.611
but systems are still in place

39:05.644 --> 39:08.079
that keep members of minority
communities down.

39:08.113 --> 39:11.116
For my last stop on this trip,

39:11.149 --> 39:13.685
I'm meeting with Ashley Diamond,
who fought,

39:13.719 --> 39:16.522
and is still fighting, for
reform within the state's

39:16.555 --> 39:18.023
prison system.

39:18.056 --> 39:20.626
How can we go on "Gaycation"
and not have a glass of wine?

39:20.659 --> 39:22.093
That wouldn't be good.

39:22.127 --> 39:23.862
That's sort of the setting
pretty much every day.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.631
[ Laughs ]
Yeah, right?

39:25.664 --> 39:28.700
Four years ago, Ashley was
convicted of a non-violent crime

39:28.734 --> 39:32.938
and was sent to a series of
high-security male-only prisons.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.973
So, when I arrived at the place
in Jackson,

39:35.006 --> 39:37.776
I will never forget the yellow
lines and standing on the "X."

39:37.809 --> 39:40.979
I will never forget the
humiliation of being stripped

39:41.012 --> 39:43.081
in front of all those men
and having breasts

39:43.114 --> 39:45.617
and everybody looking at me.
I'll never forget when

39:45.651 --> 39:48.086
they called my name off the bus
'cause there's a roster.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.055
But I'll never forget when they
said "Ashley Diamond"

39:50.088 --> 39:51.957
and I stood up and they were
like, "What the fuh?"

39:51.990 --> 39:53.859
That was their exact words.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.594
What's going on with your
hormone treatment

39:55.627 --> 39:56.962
and just that part of
the equation?

39:56.995 --> 39:58.830
They were like, "We're not gonna
give you that,

39:58.864 --> 40:00.532
but we're gonna --"
The state of Georgia

40:00.566 --> 40:02.033
was gonna make a man out of me.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.802
And I was told that often.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.471
And what -- what did that do to
you? I mean, what --

40:05.504 --> 40:07.105
Oh, my gosh, four years of not
having hormones

40:07.138 --> 40:09.140
for the first time in my life,
I had facial hair -- beard.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.477
I was crying.
I was vomiting all the time.

40:11.510 --> 40:15.080
I would never wish that on
anybody in the entire world.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.815
I mean, prison, in general,
is probably scary for people

40:16.848 --> 40:18.183
that have not been in prison.
It is. Prison is.

40:18.216 --> 40:19.851
And that's the thing that
I need to emphasize.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.920
Listen, I literally was housed
with a guy in a room

40:21.953 --> 40:23.989
who had 235 years.
For what?

40:24.022 --> 40:25.691
A rape.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.793
You put 135-pound
transgender woman

40:27.826 --> 40:30.496
in a cell with
a 220-something-pound man

40:30.529 --> 40:33.732
who's not had sex with a woman
since the last person

40:33.765 --> 40:36.001
he raped and killed.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.703
What do you think's gonna
happen?

40:37.736 --> 40:40.506
Hmm.
I wasn't in prison 30 days.

40:40.539 --> 40:43.074
I was raped and beaten, gang
raped by six guys and beaten.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.511
I thought that that was the
first -- you know,

40:45.544 --> 40:48.146
that that would change after
that, but that set the tone.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.248
I'm understanding, then,
that there's some officers

40:50.281 --> 40:52.818
that gave you a phone just to --
An officer let me use his.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.953
And what was his
intention with that?

40:54.986 --> 40:56.622
To help me get the word out.

40:56.655 --> 40:58.156
I cannot stress to you

40:58.189 --> 41:01.226
what a treacherous journey this
has been.

41:01.259 --> 41:04.930
This is about gross human-right
violations.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.666
What you can see is only
25-second snippets

41:07.699 --> 41:10.235
because this is the only way
to get it out.

41:10.268 --> 41:14.906
When I came into the system,
this is what I looked like.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.576
My body shape has changed.

41:17.609 --> 41:20.579
The way my skin looks
and feels.

41:20.612 --> 41:21.980
Morally and ethically,

41:22.013 --> 41:24.850
everything that has happened
to me is wrong.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.519
Sexual violence has become a way
of life

41:27.553 --> 41:30.021
in the Georgia Department
of Corrections.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.057
Many of our stories go unheard

41:32.090 --> 41:34.993
or even never even reach
the right ears.

41:35.026 --> 41:37.295
It's time to stop this now.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.598
DANIEL: Last year, Ashley filed
a case against

41:39.631 --> 41:41.232
the Georgia Department
of Corrections.

41:41.266 --> 41:43.869
Because of her, the state is
reviewing their

41:43.902 --> 41:46.838
sexual-assault policies,
and many transgender inmates

41:46.872 --> 41:49.808
across the country now have
access to their hormones.

41:49.841 --> 41:54.646
A powerful first step towards
reform in the ongoing battle

41:54.680 --> 41:57.783
for human rights
for LGBTQ inmates.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.951
"Without you, I wouldn't
be able to be myself.

41:59.985 --> 42:02.253
You gave me courage with
your courage.

42:02.287 --> 42:04.155
And you gave me hope
inside of me.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.924
You gave me a fight
to fight for."

42:05.957 --> 42:07.292
See, that makes me want to cry.

42:07.325 --> 42:09.728
I mean...

42:09.761 --> 42:11.863
people are really moved
by you, you know?

42:11.897 --> 42:14.065
I've got to fight.
Somebody's got to fight.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.967
Somebody.

42:16.001 --> 42:19.137
So I encourage whoever that is
that may be listening --

42:19.170 --> 42:21.239
If it's something you need
to change, the only way

42:21.272 --> 42:23.742
it's gonna change
is if you change it.

42:23.775 --> 42:25.176
Mm-hmm.
And people always say,

42:25.210 --> 42:26.845
"What can I do?
I'm one person."

42:26.878 --> 42:29.981
It only took one person.

42:30.015 --> 42:34.352
Look at history.
It always takes one person.

42:34.385 --> 42:37.022
Plug it over here.
This is your studio?

42:37.055 --> 42:38.590
Uh-huh.
It's nice.

42:38.624 --> 42:41.259
This is the studio where all
the dreams happen.

42:41.292 --> 42:45.130
* We clawed, we chained,
our hearts in vain *

42:45.163 --> 42:48.834
* We jumped,
never asking why *

42:48.867 --> 42:50.201
Where's the mic go?

42:50.235 --> 42:53.038
* We kissed
I fell under your spell *

42:53.071 --> 42:57.375
* A love no one can deny

42:57.408 --> 43:01.680
* Don't you ever say
I just walked away *

43:01.713 --> 43:03.081
* I will always love you --

43:03.114 --> 43:05.050
* Always want you
Oh, "want you."

43:05.083 --> 43:09.621
* I can't live a lie,
running for my life *

43:09.655 --> 43:12.724
* I will always want you

43:12.758 --> 43:14.726
Oh, this is your verse.
You do the first one.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.896
* I came in like
a wrecking ball *

43:17.929 --> 43:21.633
* I never hit so hard
in love *

43:21.667 --> 43:26.037
* All I wanted was to break
your walls *

43:26.071 --> 43:30.709
* All you ever did
was wreck me *

43:30.742 --> 43:33.178
DANIEL: Southern values
are at the core

43:33.211 --> 43:35.146
of what it means to be American.

43:35.180 --> 43:37.683
The rebellion,
self-determination,

43:37.716 --> 43:41.987
and disruption of its history is
reflected in the LGBTQ community

43:42.020 --> 43:43.855
in the present.

43:43.889 --> 43:46.057
Throughout my trip,
I've experienced

43:46.091 --> 43:48.660
Southern hospitality, passion,
and charm.

43:48.694 --> 43:52.097
And through the people I've met,
I've seen what it means to be

43:52.130 --> 43:54.800
queer and Southern,
and it's tough as nails.

43:54.833 --> 43:56.434
Boo-yah!

43:56.467 --> 43:58.704
We'll be here all week, people.
