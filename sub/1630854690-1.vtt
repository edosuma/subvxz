WEBVTT

00:04.654 --> 00:06.547
(tense music)

00:07.416 --> 00:09.566
- Tell her it's gonna be okay.

00:09.585 --> 00:11.418
- Is it gonna be okay?

00:11.570 --> 00:13.754
- Yeah, Beck can defuse
these bombs in his sleep.

00:13.906 --> 00:15.405
- Yeah, well, Beck's dead, so...

00:15.424 --> 00:18.517
- Without Beck, we're gonna have
to figure out a different way

00:18.594 --> 00:19.685
to get her off this IED.

00:19.912 --> 00:21.503
- There is no other way, man.

00:21.580 --> 00:23.522
If we try, we're gonna die
with her.

00:24.508 --> 00:25.599
(sighing)

00:25.675 --> 00:27.484
Where are you going?

00:31.924 --> 00:33.532
(clattering)

00:40.099 --> 00:42.750
(grunts)

00:43.711 --> 00:46.045
- Alright, she's gonna step off,

00:46.121 --> 00:48.047
and you slide this bag
on top of the IED.

00:48.198 --> 00:49.864
- No! No! Terrible idea.

00:49.884 --> 00:52.551
- Do you have a better idea?
- Yeah, running comes to mind.

00:52.628 --> 00:54.294
- Just do it, tell her.

00:54.446 --> 00:56.889
Echo one, we're gonna need
about five minutes.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.057
<i> (on radio): You've got two,</i>

00:58.133 --> 00:59.966
<i> or I'm leaving your asses</i>
<i> behind.</i>

01:00.119 --> 01:01.510
- Okay, man, we gotta go.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.121
- This thing was put here
to kill us, not her.

01:04.139 --> 01:05.230
Okay? She's only sitting on it

01:05.382 --> 01:06.565
because we chased her down
the hall.

01:06.716 --> 01:08.959
- No, she's on it because
her father's the devil.

01:08.961 --> 01:10.402
Or... you know, was.

01:10.479 --> 01:14.114
- Look, we came here
to kill him, not his kid.

01:15.651 --> 01:18.802
I got a son, about your age.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.747
His name is Keith.
See this bracelet?

01:21.824 --> 01:23.398
It's a good-luck bracelet.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.825
Every single time I'm scared,

01:24.901 --> 01:26.810
I touch it and
good things happen.

01:26.812 --> 01:27.994
You want to give it a try?

01:28.071 --> 01:30.297
(He translates for the girl.)

01:32.501 --> 01:34.075
Good.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.244
We're good now,
I promise. Okay?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.247
Alright, we're gonna do this.
You should go.

01:39.325 --> 01:40.582
- Yeah, so should you.

01:40.676 --> 01:43.102
You got about 90 seconds,
he's not gonna wait for you.

01:46.107 --> 01:47.848
- Hey, hey...

01:48.000 --> 01:50.484
The gold goes on,
you get off. Okay?

01:51.946 --> 01:53.237
Nice and easy.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.157
(tense music)

02:03.682 --> 02:06.333
That's good. Yeah.

02:07.870 --> 02:10.003
(jerky breathing)

02:12.282 --> 02:13.281
Yeah.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.758
Good.

02:15.544 --> 02:16.951
Really good.

02:16.971 --> 02:19.029
Good. Great.

02:19.047 --> 02:21.381
(relieved laughter)

02:21.533 --> 02:22.683
We're good.

02:24.203 --> 02:25.627
(beeping)
Go. Go!

02:25.704 --> 02:27.312
Go, go, go, go!

02:30.133 --> 02:32.467
Go, go, go, go! Let's go!

02:32.544 --> 02:34.736
(dramatic music)

02:42.388 --> 02:44.496
(cheering)

02:45.166 --> 02:47.332
- Okay. Settle down.

02:47.484 --> 02:48.892
Hey! Quiet down!

02:48.911 --> 02:51.578
Quiet down!
To those we've lost,

02:51.655 --> 02:53.321
may they rest in peace.

02:53.399 --> 02:55.657
To the dearly departed
Mr. Abbas,

02:55.734 --> 02:57.417
may he rest in hell!

02:57.494 --> 02:59.494
(cheering)

02:59.571 --> 03:01.162
- As you all know,

03:01.182 --> 03:04.516
everyone's favourite
private contractor

03:04.668 --> 03:06.092
is leaving us tomorrow.

03:06.169 --> 03:08.187
(all cheering): Jason! Jason!
- Come on, let's go!

03:08.263 --> 03:11.748
- On behalf of all of us
in Delta company,

03:11.767 --> 03:14.008
we all feel a lot safer...

03:14.086 --> 03:15.510
...knowing you're going home!

03:15.529 --> 03:18.197
(laughter, cheering)

03:20.943 --> 03:23.493
(phone vibrating)

03:26.022 --> 03:27.355
- Hey, baby.

03:27.433 --> 03:28.540
- Keith is gone.

03:28.692 --> 03:31.043
- Baby, I can't hear you,
you gotta speak up,

03:31.194 --> 03:32.544
there's animals everywhere.

03:32.621 --> 03:34.955
- Our son is missing.

03:35.031 --> 03:36.940
- What do you mean
he's missing, baby?

03:36.959 --> 03:37.958
- He's not...

03:38.293 --> 03:39.701
<i> - What about Rud's,</i>
<i> what about Dru's house?</i>

03:39.778 --> 03:41.035
<i> Did you call them?</i>
- No!

03:41.055 --> 03:43.371
- Nikki, I can't hear you.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

03:43.449 --> 03:44.706
Come on, come on.

03:44.783 --> 03:46.466
(He turns off the music.)
(disappointed groans)

03:46.618 --> 03:49.286
No, I know.
Nikki, Nikki, listen to me.

03:49.288 --> 03:50.878
<i> He's got to be somewhere.</i>

03:51.623 --> 03:53.457
- They said that's
he's been taken.

03:53.591 --> 03:55.125
- Who's "they"?

03:55.127 --> 03:56.977
- The MPU.

03:57.129 --> 03:58.628
<i> The MPU...</i>

03:58.647 --> 04:00.480
- You spoke to the Missing
Persons Unit.

04:00.557 --> 04:01.965
<i> What did they say?</i>

04:01.984 --> 04:04.301
- They said that
he's been abducted.

04:04.303 --> 04:06.303
- I'm gonna be home in 16 hours

04:06.305 --> 04:07.821
and I'm gonna find him
myself, okay?

04:07.897 --> 04:09.656
I promise you,
we will figure this out,

04:09.733 --> 04:12.084
we will get to the bottom
of this. I love you. Alright?

04:12.235 --> 04:13.710
- I love you too.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.094
(heavy music)

04:33.332 --> 04:36.024
Hey, baby. Come here.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.779
It's okay. It's okay.

04:40.930 --> 04:42.572
We're gonna find him.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.128
(theme music)

05:08.625 --> 05:11.217
- Hey, Nik. Oh.

05:11.795 --> 05:13.720
I have something.
I was...

05:13.797 --> 05:18.725
I was working security detail
for Selena last night.

05:18.802 --> 05:20.819
- Hum-hum.
- I go backstage

05:20.970 --> 05:22.637
and I find this pizza.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.156
- I love pizza for breakfast.

05:24.307 --> 05:26.974
It's you letting yourself in
that... not so much.

05:27.069 --> 05:30.645
- Anyway, it has black licorice
and egg yolk,

05:30.722 --> 05:34.057
which I know sounds insane...
- Did you forget something?

05:34.059 --> 05:35.742
- Are you vegan again?
No cheese for you?

05:35.894 --> 05:37.561
- It's not the pizza, Jay, okay?

05:37.579 --> 05:40.263
I love pizza, I think the pizza
is amazing.

05:40.265 --> 05:41.506
I'm glad that you brought
the pizza.

05:41.658 --> 05:43.491
It's just that I wish
that you would've also brought

05:43.510 --> 05:46.327
the divorce papers.
- Oh, I think if you try

05:46.347 --> 05:49.014
the pizza, you might not be
in such a rush.

05:49.165 --> 05:50.423
- We have been separated
for three years,

05:50.576 --> 05:52.500
I have been with Mike
for two, okay?

05:52.519 --> 05:55.354
You and June run a private
security service.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.581
You have been to at least
three fertility clinics.

05:57.599 --> 05:59.006
You're gonna have a baby.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.084
I wouldn't call that a rush.

06:01.103 --> 06:02.419
- So no, on the pizza?

06:02.437 --> 06:04.363
(sighs)

06:04.514 --> 06:05.697
Okay.

06:06.925 --> 06:09.759
Okay, we can just sign
the papers.

06:09.778 --> 06:11.185
- Thank you.

06:11.263 --> 06:13.372
- Look, I know we have
to do this,

06:13.448 --> 06:15.207
I just... it feels... strange.

06:15.283 --> 06:18.693
I feel like I wish we could do
it more in the old-fashioned way

06:18.770 --> 06:20.879
and be mad at each other,
like you cheated on me or...

06:21.030 --> 06:23.440
...at least, stole money
and hid it somewhere

06:23.442 --> 06:25.032
or something to make me
hate you.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.943
(phone buzzing)

06:26.962 --> 06:28.111
- Oh, I have to go.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.388
I have to go.

06:29.615 --> 06:31.615
- I don't understand
how you do that, Nik.

06:31.617 --> 06:33.800
I don't understand how you
search for other people's kids

06:33.877 --> 06:35.118
when we never found ours.

06:35.137 --> 06:37.621
Some marriages could survive
that type of loss.

06:37.639 --> 06:39.564
I'm sorry ours couldn't.

06:39.716 --> 06:43.193
Keith would be 17 next week.

06:43.979 --> 06:46.071
- Yeah. Hey.

06:46.298 --> 06:47.647
(sighs)
You look terrible.

06:47.724 --> 06:49.241
- Maybe it's the pizza.

06:49.392 --> 06:51.134
- I don't think it's the pizza.

06:51.153 --> 06:53.036
(soft music)

07:01.955 --> 07:03.547
I love you.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.591
- I love you too.

07:08.003 --> 07:09.577
(He signs the papers.)

07:09.596 --> 07:12.681
(phones buzzing)

07:19.848 --> 07:21.589
<i> - Her name is Chloe Garber.</i>

07:21.591 --> 07:24.258
<i> Witnesses say there were</i>
<i> two men, mid-thirties,</i>

07:24.336 --> 07:26.111
<i> heavily armed, wide,</i>
<i> in a black van.</i>

07:26.188 --> 07:28.429
Good news is: the alert went on

07:28.449 --> 07:30.173
nine minutes after
she was taken.

07:30.192 --> 07:31.783
- Which was 32 minutes ago.
- Yeah.

07:31.952 --> 07:35.102
- And the average traffic
at this time of day
is 20 miles an hour.

07:35.122 --> 07:38.198
That gives us a search area
of 314 square miles.

07:38.274 --> 07:40.350
- I guess I meant
there was no good news.

07:40.368 --> 07:41.793
- Where are we on the van?

07:41.870 --> 07:43.703
- It was reported stolen
two days ago.

07:43.855 --> 07:46.206
We questioned the registered
owner, and his alibi checks out.

07:46.282 --> 07:47.949
- The public?
- So far, we have seven

07:47.968 --> 07:51.085
false leads, three selfies
and a dozen crank calls.

07:51.162 --> 07:52.971
Like I said,
the news is terrible.

07:53.122 --> 07:55.048
- Please tell me they didn't
toss the girl's cell?

07:55.142 --> 07:57.225
- Before they'd go on the block.

07:58.553 --> 08:01.796
(Nik): Smart, masked,
carrying semi-automatics.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.799
A dozen kids to pick from and
they picked Chloe. Why?

08:05.711 --> 08:09.321
Kemi, anything on the dark web?
- Nothing yet.

08:10.215 --> 08:12.732
- Kem, I love you, but we don't
have time for that.

08:12.884 --> 08:17.554
- Sure, if facts were
all that would find Chloe.

08:17.572 --> 08:19.480
But... as I believe,

08:19.500 --> 08:24.077
finding her is equal parts
faith and fact.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.714
Hence my praying
is time well spent.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.582
- Preach.

08:30.493 --> 08:34.087
I know you're a skeptic, Mike,
but I love you anyway.

08:34.239 --> 08:36.239
Police work hasn't brought
Keith back.

08:36.258 --> 08:38.683
All I have is faith. Come on.

08:40.762 --> 08:44.981
(She speaks words
in another language.)

08:47.694 --> 08:51.271
- I... I understand that
this all can be traumatizing.

08:51.347 --> 08:55.016
And it's impossible
not to think the worst.

08:55.093 --> 08:57.410
But I want you to know...

08:58.597 --> 09:02.189
We get our babies back.
It's what we do.

09:02.267 --> 09:03.933
- If you can fill in
some blanks for us,

09:03.935 --> 09:07.212
you know, concerns
you might have about adults
in Chloe's life.

09:07.363 --> 09:10.123
You know, things she might have
said about coaches, teachers?

09:10.275 --> 09:11.883
- There wasn't anything.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.960
Everything was perfect.

09:14.037 --> 09:15.945
- Hannah was on her way
to pick her up.

09:15.964 --> 09:18.390
And there was traffic,
so she was late.

09:18.466 --> 09:21.451
- This isn't my fault.
- No, that's not what I meant.

09:21.469 --> 09:23.303
- My job isn't why
this happened.

09:23.455 --> 09:25.730
- Roger, honey, what do you do?

09:25.882 --> 09:28.567
- I work for Brewster Aerospace,
I'm in sales.

09:28.643 --> 09:31.811
- Do you have any reason
to believe why anyone
would want to target her?

09:31.888 --> 09:35.148
- No, of course not. She's
a normal nine-year-old girl.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.075
- I want to see it, the video.

09:37.152 --> 09:38.968
- That's natural,
but trust me,

09:38.987 --> 09:40.820
there is nothing on it
other than heartache.

09:40.897 --> 09:44.624
- I want to see it. I want
to see what happened to my baby.

09:45.327 --> 09:46.543
- Okay.

09:49.331 --> 09:51.131
(sighing)

10:02.677 --> 10:04.227
- There was an accident.

10:05.421 --> 10:07.939
It was a fender bender,
it was...

10:08.166 --> 10:09.999
It was nothing.

10:10.018 --> 10:11.943
But it's why I was too late.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.594
- No, you weren't too late.

10:13.672 --> 10:15.614
I meant what I said.

10:16.432 --> 10:20.176
We get our babies back
and we're gonna get yours.

10:21.029 --> 10:23.437
- I've got a sighting.
Two women called it in.

10:23.515 --> 10:25.248
I sent you a photo they took.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.959
It's at the Lincoln Motel.

10:28.778 --> 10:31.129
- Do you have an address?

10:32.448 --> 10:34.966
- No! No, no, no, no.
Put the phone down.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.877
This girl, what room is she in?

10:38.029 --> 10:40.513
- Uh, 415.
- Which way?

10:41.700 --> 10:44.517
(tense music)

10:54.137 --> 10:56.154
(screaming)

10:58.492 --> 10:59.658
- No, let me go!

10:59.734 --> 11:02.051
- We're not gonna make it
down in time.

11:02.053 --> 11:03.328
- Not using the stairs.

11:03.405 --> 11:06.480
- What? No, no, no, no.
Bad idea!

11:06.558 --> 11:08.041
(grunting)

11:21.831 --> 11:23.589
(screaming)
(engine revving)

11:23.666 --> 11:25.684
(indistinct yelling)

11:27.595 --> 11:29.145
(tires screeching)

11:31.174 --> 11:32.749
- Hands out of the window!

11:32.767 --> 11:34.209
Show me your hands!

11:34.211 --> 11:36.069
I'm not asking again.

11:37.013 --> 11:39.680
Get the door. Out!

11:39.700 --> 11:41.282
- Alright, on the ground.

11:42.944 --> 11:44.185
- Hey, baby girl.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.870
(breathing shakily)

11:46.022 --> 11:47.096
I'm Nikki.

11:47.098 --> 11:48.707
Come here.

11:51.102 --> 11:53.253
You're a very brave girl.

11:54.789 --> 11:57.415
- You say on your questionnaire
that you have a daughter.

11:57.567 --> 12:00.534
- I do. Yeah, Sidney.
- And she's adopted.

12:00.612 --> 12:03.796
- Yeah. But not because we
couldn't have kids of our own.

12:03.949 --> 12:07.392
My ex and I figured
that there were a lot of
unwanted children out there,

12:07.427 --> 12:09.469
so adoption was
the right thing to do.

12:09.545 --> 12:11.287
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

12:11.289 --> 12:12.731
- Now, she'll have a sibling.

12:12.807 --> 12:16.217
- Again, yeah, we also adopted
a boy named Keith.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.486
He... hum, he passed.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.463
- I'm so sorry.

12:20.482 --> 12:23.299
- No, no, it's okay, don't be.
This is my stop, huh?

12:23.318 --> 12:24.242
- Yeah.

12:24.393 --> 12:26.819
Okay, so once we have
a semen sample,

12:26.896 --> 12:28.821
we can determine whether
you have a low sperm count,

12:28.823 --> 12:31.732
which could explain
why your sperm hasn't been able

12:31.810 --> 12:33.643
to fertilize your partner's egg.

12:33.645 --> 12:35.211
- In the collection room.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.557
(phone vibrating)

12:52.497 --> 12:53.329
(beep)

12:53.331 --> 12:54.755
Hey, butter, what's happening?

12:54.849 --> 12:57.942
<i> - Oh, hey, Dad, what's up?</i>
- Nothing, just busy.

12:58.019 --> 12:59.502
<i> - Busy doing nothing?</i>

12:59.504 --> 13:01.095
- Everything okay?
<i> - Oh yeah, I just wanted</i>

13:01.172 --> 13:03.356
<i> to let you know that Tess is</i>
<i>having a kickback later tonight</i>

13:03.432 --> 13:06.484
<i>and I was gonna go after school</i>
<i> and I'll just get a ride home</i>
<i> when it's done.</i>

13:06.636 --> 13:09.954
- Okay. Have fun.
Not too much fun, though.

13:10.031 --> 13:11.456
<i> - Is there such a thing?</i>

13:11.533 --> 13:13.016
- For my daughter, yeah,
absolutely.

13:13.034 --> 13:17.504
<i> - Okay, I gotta go. Love you,</i>
<i> have fun doing nothing.</i>

13:23.695 --> 13:25.011
(phone vibrating)

13:26.807 --> 13:28.139
(beep)

13:31.627 --> 13:33.978
(tense music)

13:34.055 --> 13:36.130
<i> - Hey, Chloe's being</i>
<i> checked out by the ENTs.</i>

13:36.149 --> 13:37.390
<i> Kemi's gonna question</i>
<i> the kidnapper.</i>

13:37.542 --> 13:38.966
- I need to call
Chloe's parents.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.467
- Yeah, hey, woah,
it's already done.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.635
Can we talk for a second?

13:41.655 --> 13:43.488
That swan dive,
are you out of your mind?

13:43.639 --> 13:44.730
- Okay, I jumped,
it was nothing.

13:44.807 --> 13:47.308
- Well, whatever it was,
when you did it...

13:48.311 --> 13:50.069
I was sure that I was never
gonna see you again.

13:50.146 --> 13:53.665
And in my life, I have never
hated somebody so much.

13:54.483 --> 13:59.128
And when you splashed down,
I realized why.

14:00.748 --> 14:02.081
- Mike, what are you doing?

14:02.158 --> 14:04.250
- Do you remember the kiss cam?

14:04.402 --> 14:05.735
At that Phillies game?

14:05.737 --> 14:07.753
That white guy with no rhythm.

14:07.906 --> 14:09.663
- No, no, no way.

14:10.575 --> 14:12.041
(voice breaking
as he starts singing)

14:12.077 --> 14:14.077
(throat clearing)
- Oh.

14:14.079 --> 14:17.689
♪ Let's stay together

14:17.840 --> 14:22.176
♪ I'm lovin' you whether

14:22.178 --> 14:29.108
♪ Whether times are good
or bad, happy or sad ♪♪

14:29.260 --> 14:30.702
(laughing)
- Oh my God.

14:33.948 --> 14:35.781
- Is there any chance
you'll marry me?

14:35.934 --> 14:38.492
Don't worry,
I cleared it with HR.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.004
(emotional laughter)

14:41.940 --> 14:43.590
Is that a yes?

14:44.959 --> 14:46.459
- That's a yes.

14:46.535 --> 14:49.012
(applause, cheering)

14:55.061 --> 14:56.877
- You guys, I'm really,
really sorry to interrupt.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.213
- Oh, come on! Jay, man, that's
not really the best time, man.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.807
- I understand and I wouldn't
do it if... It's important.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.068
- Whatever it is, it can wait.
- No, it can't wait, actually.

15:04.220 --> 15:06.479
- Go, go, go.
- Thank you, sorry.

15:07.482 --> 15:09.556
- Is it about Sidney?
Because she told me

15:09.634 --> 15:11.409
that she called you
and you were acting weird.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.244
- It's not about Sidney.
It's about Keith.

15:13.396 --> 15:14.654
- Keith?

15:15.231 --> 15:16.998
What about Keith?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.584
- He's alive, Nik.

15:19.661 --> 15:22.503
(melancholic music)

15:36.010 --> 15:38.344
<i> (Nikki): I became the head</i>
<i> of the Missing Persons Unit</i>

15:38.496 --> 15:40.754
<i> to find one person.</i>
<i> Our son.</i>

15:40.774 --> 15:42.106
<i> And if this was our son,</i>

15:42.183 --> 15:44.183
<i> I'd move Heaven and Earth</i>
<i> to find him.</i>

15:44.260 --> 15:45.351
<i> But his eyes...</i>

15:46.171 --> 15:48.112
I don't recognize his eyes.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.781
- No, don't... Forget the eyes.

15:49.932 --> 15:52.784
The scar, that's the tell. When
Casey poured the coffee on him.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.677
- Yeah, I remember
how he got it.

15:54.696 --> 15:58.790
I remember everything about him,
including...

15:58.792 --> 16:00.583
...his eyes.

16:02.704 --> 16:05.612
- You're scared. I understand,
I'm scared too.

16:05.690 --> 16:09.509
- I'm not scared.
Jay, I am terrified.

16:10.878 --> 16:13.029
I have been down
this road before.

16:13.047 --> 16:15.214
And I know where it ends.

16:16.125 --> 16:18.701
You don't, because you quit
the force and moved on.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.721
- I quit being a cop, okay?
I didn't move on.

16:21.873 --> 16:23.889
Alright? And I didn't
get engaged. Congratulations,

16:23.966 --> 16:25.966
I like Mike, Mike is great.
You could have done worse.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.060
You did do worse: me.
I was worse.

16:28.062 --> 16:29.654
(sniffling)
- Well, you and June

16:29.731 --> 16:31.047
are trying to have a baby.

16:31.140 --> 16:36.810
Isn't... replacing Keith
the definition of moving on?

16:36.830 --> 16:38.329
- I'm hopeful, Nik.

16:38.481 --> 16:40.906
For the first time
in a long time, I'm hopeful

16:41.059 --> 16:43.626
and I thought this photo would
do the same thing for you.

16:47.232 --> 16:49.248
- I want to show you something.

16:50.585 --> 16:53.236
- So what, working
with the dead, you actually
have to work in a tomb?

16:53.254 --> 16:55.680
- C does spatial reconstruction
from human remains.

16:55.757 --> 16:58.516
- I didn't know Dr. Jekyll
was on the payroll.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.409
- Stop.
(beeps)

17:00.428 --> 17:02.169
Hey. C...

17:02.247 --> 17:03.596
- Captain Batista.

17:03.672 --> 17:05.373
- This is Jason. He's my ex.
- How you doin'?

17:05.449 --> 17:09.193
- I wanted to show him the age
progression photos of Keith.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.279
- Yeah.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.180
There.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.284
- I texted you a proof of life
photo, can you pull it up?

17:18.854 --> 17:21.781
- That's him. That is him.

17:21.857 --> 17:23.449
- C, what do you think?

17:23.526 --> 17:25.935
- Oh, I...
(nervous laughter)

17:25.953 --> 17:27.837
- Do you think it's Keith?

17:29.198 --> 17:33.609
- I think I've seen matches
that are... closer.

17:33.611 --> 17:35.702
- Chloe checked out,
she's ready to go home.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.204
Hi, Jay.
- Hey, Kemi.

17:37.282 --> 17:39.223
Kemi does background
identification.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.467
Maybe she can narrow down
where this photo was taken.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.728
- You heard C.
He does this for a living.

17:43.805 --> 17:45.137
- I heard it was inconclusive.

17:45.214 --> 17:47.456
Inconclusive means
that it could be Keith.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.809
Is that not worth digging into
just a little bit?

17:49.961 --> 17:51.310
- I'm gonna go take Chloe home.

17:51.462 --> 17:53.963
And Kemi here is going
to question our suspect.

17:53.965 --> 17:55.798
- Wait.
- Okay, fine.

17:55.817 --> 17:57.182
Text her the photo.

17:57.260 --> 17:59.302
But please, do not get
your hopes up.

17:59.304 --> 18:00.620
- Okay.

18:03.141 --> 18:06.567
Nice to meet you.
- It's more of a crypt,

18:06.628 --> 18:09.128
actually, than a tomb.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.238
- So you heard.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.998
- Yeah, people like you
can't help it, so...

18:13.151 --> 18:14.817
- "People like me"?

18:14.836 --> 18:16.319
- Huh, pre-disabled.

18:16.321 --> 18:18.487
- Well, I'm uncomfortable.

18:18.506 --> 18:19.472
(chuckling)

18:20.266 --> 18:22.491
- Will I turn into Mr. Hyde?

18:23.419 --> 18:25.010
<i> - There's something</i>
<i> we're not seeing here.</i>

18:25.163 --> 18:27.230
We could really use your help.

18:29.925 --> 18:31.834
- This is the guy
that took the girl?

18:31.836 --> 18:33.594
- Yes. Hasn't said a word.

18:33.671 --> 18:36.005
- Oh, you should try
singing to him.

18:36.007 --> 18:38.265
A little of your Al Green,
he might cop to killing Tupac.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.100
- Or maybe he would say yes
to marrying me.

18:40.178 --> 18:41.935
She did.
- Yes, she did.

18:42.013 --> 18:44.847
(laughter)
Can I look at the evidence log?

18:44.866 --> 18:48.775
♪ Whatever you want to do

18:48.853 --> 18:51.687
♪ Is alright with me ♪

18:51.689 --> 18:53.447
- Okay... Such an idiot.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.375
- Yeah, Nikki told me about
Keith's photo.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.211
You were right for having Kemi
take a look.

18:59.213 --> 19:03.699
- This guy had Uzis,
passports with RFID chips.

19:03.792 --> 19:05.201
He's a... he's a player, huh.

19:05.720 --> 19:10.039
- There's a wall of photos
in my office with all
the people we find.

19:10.057 --> 19:12.441
And there's a hole there
for Keith.

19:13.544 --> 19:16.136
He was my case,
my responsibility.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.115
And I pray that hole's
about to be filled.

19:21.552 --> 19:22.551
- Hey.

19:22.553 --> 19:24.236
- You're not supposed
to be here.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.479
- Do you...

19:25.498 --> 19:27.498
Do you know what this is,
right here?

19:27.650 --> 19:28.908
- You behaving badly?

19:29.060 --> 19:30.893
- No, that is the sign
of the Triumphant.

19:30.895 --> 19:35.414
It's a terrorist group operating
at Ubari region in Libya.

19:35.491 --> 19:36.841
Why are you here?

19:36.992 --> 19:40.344
And the kidnapping failed,
so you might as well tell us.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.098
- I failed.

19:46.093 --> 19:48.761
But the kidnapping will succeed.

19:49.338 --> 19:51.189
- Hey, where's Nikki?
- What's going on?

19:51.340 --> 19:53.432
- Nikki and the girl,
where are they?

19:53.509 --> 19:55.193
(tense music)

20:01.183 --> 20:03.684
<i> (woman): Hello?</i>
- Special delivery.

20:03.761 --> 20:05.018
- Mom, it's me!

20:05.096 --> 20:06.779
<i> - Oh my God.</i>
<i> I'm buzzing you in.</i>

20:06.855 --> 20:09.498
<i> We're 1129.</i>
- Hey!

20:15.864 --> 20:17.048
What's this?

20:17.199 --> 20:18.716
- I won it at my last meet.

20:18.867 --> 20:20.885
I finished third
in the backstroke.

20:20.962 --> 20:23.870
- Wow! You must be really good.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.265
- Well, last week,
I got my green cap.

20:27.710 --> 20:29.118
Mom always says:

20:29.120 --> 20:30.728
"You should do something nice

20:30.805 --> 20:32.379
for people who do something
nice for you."

20:32.398 --> 20:36.809
The pin might open up sometimes,
so just be careful.

20:36.885 --> 20:40.738
- Okay, well,
I promise, I...

20:40.740 --> 20:42.490
I'll be super careful.

20:44.469 --> 20:46.410
Oh. Thanks.

20:46.562 --> 20:48.287
(amused laughter)

20:50.917 --> 20:52.641
- What floor?

20:52.660 --> 20:54.493
- I live on 11th.

20:54.645 --> 20:56.812
- 11th? My lucky number.

20:56.905 --> 20:58.481
- I got it.

20:58.499 --> 20:59.906
(beep)

20:59.926 --> 21:01.592
- Everything's gonna be fine.

21:01.669 --> 21:03.427
Okay? I promise.
- What is?

21:03.579 --> 21:05.429
- Nothing's gonna happen to you.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.224
(grunts)

21:10.661 --> 21:11.844
(screaming)

21:11.996 --> 21:13.679
(fast-paced music)

21:13.831 --> 21:15.231
(grunts)

21:18.260 --> 21:19.593
Chloe!

21:19.612 --> 21:21.320
(grunts)

21:34.627 --> 21:36.443
- You're not going anywhere.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.129
- No. You are.

21:38.205 --> 21:40.464
(gunshot)
(grunts)

21:42.360 --> 21:44.552
(grunting)

21:48.699 --> 21:50.391
(elevator dings)

21:53.962 --> 21:55.871
- Chloe.
- What happened?

21:55.890 --> 21:57.356
Where is Chloe?

21:58.484 --> 21:59.650
Where's our daughter?

22:03.489 --> 22:06.306
You lost our child!
- Nobody "lost" your daughter.

22:06.384 --> 22:07.550
She was taken
in a coordinated assault.

22:07.552 --> 22:09.218
- You told us you would
get our baby back.

22:09.236 --> 22:10.828
You said that's--
- And you told us that Chloe

22:11.055 --> 22:12.221
was a normal 9-year-old girl.

22:12.223 --> 22:13.722
What happened today
is anything but normal.

22:13.741 --> 22:17.335
- We will get your baby back.
Okay? But only if you help.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.895
What are you guys
not telling us?

22:19.988 --> 22:21.339
- Just... Nothing.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.299
- Chloe's pin.

22:24.902 --> 22:27.178
- Yes. She gave it to me.

22:27.329 --> 22:29.254
To thank me for getting her.

22:29.331 --> 22:30.848
She's a very kind person.

22:30.999 --> 22:33.517
You should be very proud of her.

22:36.689 --> 22:40.082
- Tell them. Or I will.
- There's nothing to tell.

22:40.084 --> 22:43.085
- My husband is to blame
for Chloe being taken.

22:43.178 --> 22:44.920
His job is to blame.

22:44.922 --> 22:46.346
- Hannah, you don't know that.

22:46.366 --> 22:49.258
- Chloe gave me that pin
because she trusted me.

22:49.260 --> 22:50.426
You should too.

22:50.428 --> 22:52.094
- Roger does work
for Brewster Aerospace.

22:52.113 --> 22:55.081
- Hannah...
- But Brewster is
a front company.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.932
For the CIA.

22:56.934 --> 22:58.292
- What is it that you do?

22:59.379 --> 23:01.695
- I can't tell you that.
It's classified.

23:01.789 --> 23:03.196
- I respect that.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.716
But if you ever want to see
your daughter again....

23:08.129 --> 23:09.720
...you better declassify it.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.724
- Hey. You alright?

23:13.876 --> 23:16.376
- Yeah. I will be.
As soon as we find Chloe.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.303
- What about Kemi?
Anything about Keith?

23:18.456 --> 23:19.397
- No, not yet.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.899
For now, I need your expertise
on the Garber case.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.809
It's more in your world
than ours.

23:23.961 --> 23:25.385
- Alright.

23:26.221 --> 23:29.298
Okay, um, I heard that
he's CIA.

23:29.316 --> 23:31.150
And she blames him
for what happened.

23:31.226 --> 23:33.485
- Something you never did to me.

23:34.321 --> 23:36.155
(sighs)
- Because it wasn't your fault,
Nik.

23:36.231 --> 23:39.065
Okay? We agreed I'd go
to Afghanistan for a year.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.235
I stayed for two.
If anyone's to blame, it's me.

23:42.255 --> 23:43.812
Maybe... Maybe had I
come home earlier,

23:43.831 --> 23:44.755
what happened
wouldn't have happened.

23:44.832 --> 23:46.257
- How can you want
another child?

23:46.484 --> 23:47.591
- I don't.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.152
- I thought that you and June
were trying to get pregnant.

23:50.171 --> 23:51.929
- No, she's trying
to get pregnant.

23:52.006 --> 23:53.431
I'm doing everything in my power

23:53.582 --> 23:55.491
to prevent her
from getting pregnant.

23:55.509 --> 23:56.325
- Now, I'm confused.

23:56.510 --> 23:58.769
- I fake it.
- That is not true.

23:58.846 --> 24:00.345
- I know. I'm the worst. Okay?

24:00.498 --> 24:04.424
And June has been insanely
patient. Insanely patient.

24:04.502 --> 24:06.685
I mean, she's been waiting years
for me to heal.

24:06.762 --> 24:08.929
- I meant, that is not true
that you fake it.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.115
Although, yes,
you are the worst.

24:11.266 --> 24:13.676
- Because you think
only women can fake it.

24:13.694 --> 24:15.177
- Only women do fake it.

24:15.196 --> 24:16.620
Only women can fake it.

24:16.697 --> 24:20.106
- Right. Because you think
a woman would know if a guy did.

24:20.126 --> 24:20.958
(laughing)

24:21.276 --> 24:22.534
- You think that June
doesn't know?

24:22.778 --> 24:24.853
- I think that if she did know,
she wouldn't be sending me

24:24.855 --> 24:27.539
to fertility clinics to try to
find out what's wrong with me.

24:27.692 --> 24:29.374
Which, by the way,
is why I was acting strange

24:29.527 --> 24:32.194
when Sidney called and told me
she was going to Tess's.

24:32.196 --> 24:34.287
- Wait. She didn't tell me
she was going to Tess's.

24:34.365 --> 24:35.956
- Okay. Maybe I got it wrong.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.533
Okay. Maybe I got it wrong,
alright?

24:37.551 --> 24:39.960
I'm sorry, I was busy trying
to produce a sample

24:40.037 --> 24:42.146
for a doctor who can't figure
out why I'm shooting blanks.

24:42.297 --> 24:43.889
- Why in God's name
are you doing this?

24:43.966 --> 24:46.375
- I told you why I'm doing it.
Because I haven't moved on.

24:46.377 --> 24:47.801
I can't move on.
And by the way,

24:47.820 --> 24:49.211
how do I explain that
to somebody?

24:49.230 --> 24:51.137
How do I tell somebody that?
That after six years,

24:51.157 --> 24:54.216
I'm still stuck.
- You tell them the truth.

24:54.218 --> 24:56.327
- I know, I'm terrible.
I'm terrible.

24:56.478 --> 24:57.903
I keep telling myself
I'm not gonna do it, and then,

24:57.980 --> 24:59.997
I think about Keith and I do it
again. Every single time.

25:00.148 --> 25:02.407
Anyway, the case.
How can I help?

25:02.560 --> 25:05.151
- It's not just this case. Okay?
Between defund the police,

25:05.229 --> 25:07.913
the ACAB, and officer-involved
shootings,

25:08.065 --> 25:09.840
we have lost a lot of people.

25:09.917 --> 25:11.175
Mike knows you were a great cop,

25:11.326 --> 25:12.918
and he thinks
we should hire you.

25:12.995 --> 25:15.420
- Is that right?
Your...

25:15.573 --> 25:18.590
Your next husband wants you
to hire your ex-husband?

25:18.667 --> 25:20.184
- Wants to, no.

25:20.261 --> 25:21.426
Is displaying crazy confidence

25:21.503 --> 25:23.245
in pushing for what
we need, yeah.

25:23.264 --> 25:24.855
Don't worry.
I told him you wouldn't do it.

25:24.932 --> 25:26.248
But he insisted that I ask.

25:26.267 --> 25:27.916
- I know where
the photo was taken.

25:27.918 --> 25:31.344
That is a hotel room in Vegas.

25:31.422 --> 25:33.088
- Vegas? How do you know that?

25:33.107 --> 25:34.698
- What do you see
that we don't see?

25:34.775 --> 25:36.425
- The topography.

25:36.427 --> 25:39.094
Okay, those are juniper trees
and pinyon pine.

25:39.096 --> 25:41.780
Biodiversity specific
to the Mojave zone.

25:41.932 --> 25:46.101
Based on the shadows, the photo
was taken looking west.

25:46.103 --> 25:47.378
So those are
eastern facing peaks

25:47.529 --> 25:50.122
in a mountain range
in the Mojave.

25:50.198 --> 25:52.291
A quick search on Peakview

25:52.367 --> 25:54.868
indicates that
this is Charleston Peak,

25:54.945 --> 25:57.129
located 35 miles northwest
of Vegas

25:57.205 --> 25:58.705
and clearly visible
from the Strip.

25:58.783 --> 26:01.950
- Are you saying that Keith...
- Or whoever that boy is...

26:01.969 --> 26:04.953
- ...is in a hotel
on the Vegas strip?

26:04.955 --> 26:06.471
- Not a hotel.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.458
The Blue Paradise Hotel.

26:09.476 --> 26:13.796
Okay. Um, next to Charleston
is Griffith.

26:13.814 --> 26:15.239
Two peaks.
Two data points.

26:15.316 --> 26:17.724
Two angles based on where
the photo was taken.

26:17.802 --> 26:22.137
Using Cartesian coordinates,
named for Rene Descartes,

26:22.139 --> 26:23.247
a lover of mine
in a previous life,

26:23.324 --> 26:27.067
gives us a just axis,
a coordinate axis,

26:27.086 --> 26:30.254
and this...
The point where they meet.

26:30.481 --> 26:32.756
The longitude,
latitude and altitude.

26:32.908 --> 26:34.316
- You know what floor he's on?

26:34.409 --> 26:36.743
- I am way better than that.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.054
I know what room he's in.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.307
- Police!

26:44.270 --> 26:45.269
- All clear.

26:45.663 --> 26:47.012
- We got nothing, cap.
- Alright, everybody out.

26:47.164 --> 26:49.422
Let's clear out. Now.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.566
(phone ringing)

26:55.172 --> 26:56.113
- Hello.

26:56.264 --> 26:58.282
<i> - One million.</i>
<i> By close of business.</i>

26:58.359 --> 27:01.844
- Okay. Keith... Can I just
speak to Keith, please?

27:01.862 --> 27:03.178
<i> - Instructions are being sent.</i>

27:03.197 --> 27:04.771
- Okay, that's fine.
Just put him on the ph--

27:04.849 --> 27:06.156
I just need to make sure
he's okay.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.626
<i> - One million. Or you'll never</i>
<i> see your son again.</i>

27:08.777 --> 27:10.294
- Hello?

27:11.130 --> 27:13.714
(dramatic music)

27:18.379 --> 27:21.388
(soft music)

27:30.207 --> 27:31.649
(clears throat)

27:32.318 --> 27:35.653
<i> - We're getting played.</i>
<i> - By whom? Why?</i>

27:35.804 --> 27:38.322
- One million reasons why.
- We walk into a room.

27:38.399 --> 27:40.157
A burner rings just for us.

27:40.234 --> 27:42.826
Whoever's doing this
is not playing.

27:42.978 --> 27:44.386
- One million.

27:44.405 --> 27:46.555
Sent to an untraceable account.

27:46.573 --> 27:49.391
- As opposed to a traceable one?

27:49.393 --> 27:52.077
Nik, you keep looking for
reasons not to invest in this.

27:52.229 --> 27:54.730
- And you keep ignoring
the reasons why we should.

27:54.748 --> 27:58.734
A photo from Vegas
when we're in Philadelphia.

27:58.736 --> 28:00.010
No simultaneous exchange.

28:00.162 --> 28:01.403
No instructions where
to get Keith.

28:01.405 --> 28:04.348
No guarantees at all.
- That's right.

28:04.499 --> 28:07.592
Just one guarantee. Just one,
that if we don't invest in this,

28:07.745 --> 28:10.095
if we don't try, we're throwing
away our best chance

28:10.247 --> 28:12.764
to get Keith back.
- After six years,

28:12.841 --> 28:14.525
there is no best chance.

28:15.252 --> 28:17.403
Only hope and prayer.

28:19.423 --> 28:22.366
- So what? We just do nothing?

28:22.517 --> 28:24.684
- We'll do everything
we possibly can.

28:24.778 --> 28:26.019
- Like what?

28:26.096 --> 28:27.371
- Hope and pray.

28:29.191 --> 28:31.600
- That's not good enough.
It's not good enough.

28:31.618 --> 28:34.995
It's not good enough!
- Okay. I know! I know!

28:35.105 --> 28:36.714
It's all we have.
(knocking on door)

28:38.776 --> 28:39.958
- The Garbers are here.

28:40.368 --> 28:43.554
- If you're interested, I had HR
send you the paperwork to sign.

28:43.705 --> 28:45.447
Okay? I'm bringing you in
on the case.

28:45.466 --> 28:47.783
- Oh, so not the other ones.
I've been demoted already or?

28:47.785 --> 28:49.801
- We need help, not headaches.
And right now,

28:49.954 --> 28:51.061
you're giving me a migraine.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.048
- Six years ago,
the Triumphant

28:55.067 --> 28:57.234
took over the Ubari Region
in Libya.

28:57.385 --> 29:00.386
And CENTCOM drew a plan
to drive them out

29:00.464 --> 29:04.983
and tasked the agency with
carrying out drone strikes.

29:05.135 --> 29:07.986
My job was to select
the targets.

29:08.063 --> 29:09.229
Who to kill.

29:09.306 --> 29:12.065
- We're gonna need a list
of every target.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.083
And the casualties.

29:13.160 --> 29:16.177
- O-okay, see,
if I give you that,

29:16.179 --> 29:17.403
then they're gonna know
that it came from me.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.665
- I understand
that you are worried,

29:20.742 --> 29:23.260
but your daughter
has to come first.

29:24.338 --> 29:28.673
Because we can't find Chloe
unless you do.

29:28.750 --> 29:31.435
- Garber gave us 50 names
the Agency targeted

29:31.586 --> 29:33.604
and another 50 who were
collateral damage.

29:33.831 --> 29:36.164
We factor in the next of kin
who might want revenge,

29:36.183 --> 29:37.349
we're looking at over 200 names.

29:37.501 --> 29:38.275
- Any on our radar?

29:38.426 --> 29:41.278
- No. Not ICE,
the Bureau or TSA.

29:41.355 --> 29:43.096
We've gotten every law
enforcement agency involved

29:43.173 --> 29:44.430
except the one
that matters most.

29:44.508 --> 29:46.691
So without the CIA,
we got no background intel,

29:46.844 --> 29:48.010
no dossiers.

29:48.103 --> 29:50.103
In a lot of cases,
we don't even have a photo.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.973
- Fun fact.
Soldiers in Afghanistan

29:53.050 --> 29:54.683
could not fire until
fired upon.

29:54.685 --> 29:57.127
Those rules of engagement
didn't apply to me

29:57.279 --> 29:59.037
because I was
a private contractor. Right?

29:59.114 --> 30:02.040
So Delta company took me
on patrols

30:02.117 --> 30:04.301
to shoot first
and ask questions later.

30:04.378 --> 30:07.137
- Okay. Quick question: How does
that help us find Chloe Garber?

30:07.289 --> 30:09.364
- Well, you'd be surprised
to find out

30:09.383 --> 30:10.715
how many friends you can make
when you're crazy enough

30:10.868 --> 30:14.219
to be a human tripwire.
Contractors, soldiers... spies.

30:14.296 --> 30:16.221
- Spies. As in CIA spies.

30:16.298 --> 30:17.873
- Hmm, that's right.
I gave them 200 names.

30:17.875 --> 30:20.317
They gave me 180 goat herders
and 20 possible terrorists.

30:20.394 --> 30:22.727
- Alright, great. We'll get
BOLOs out on all 20.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.137
- We don't need to.
- No.

30:24.231 --> 30:26.882
The person you're looking for
is definitely in there.

30:26.884 --> 30:28.283
- And I know who it is.

30:29.903 --> 30:31.403
Ali Saad.

30:31.555 --> 30:34.814
I saw him at the Garber's.
He's the one who took Chloe.

30:34.834 --> 30:37.501
The strike that Garber ordered
was intended to kill Saad.

30:37.652 --> 30:39.227
Instead it killed
his 11-year-old son.

30:39.246 --> 30:41.505
- If his goal was to kill Chloe,
she's already dead.

30:41.656 --> 30:43.323
- Who else was killed
in the drone strike?

30:43.342 --> 30:46.585
- A busload of villagers.
Six children. Four adults.

30:46.737 --> 30:48.178
- He's not looking
to kill Chloe.

30:48.255 --> 30:50.496
He's looking to take out
a busload of villagers.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.850
- I think he's looking
to do more than that.

30:53.001 --> 30:54.334
I mean, he picked her up twice.

30:54.411 --> 30:56.928
He's going for something
bigger than a bus.

30:57.005 --> 30:58.930
We gotta go back
to the kidnapper.

30:59.083 --> 31:00.006
- He's not giving us his name.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.099
He's not gonna give us
the target.

31:01.251 --> 31:02.767
- No, that's because
he doesn't want us

31:02.862 --> 31:04.586
to stop the attack.
But what if...

31:04.605 --> 31:06.512
What if he thinks
it's already been stopped?

31:06.532 --> 31:09.533
- Get me every crime scene image
we have at the Garber's.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.994
And every photo we have on Saad.

31:12.946 --> 31:14.204
- What are you guys thinking?

31:14.431 --> 31:16.665
- That C better be good
at his job.

31:20.528 --> 31:22.212
- Your age progression
software...

31:22.364 --> 31:24.548
Can you alter any image with it?

31:25.867 --> 31:28.719
- Uh... Well...

31:43.827 --> 31:45.485
Does that answer
your question?

31:47.907 --> 31:48.888
- Pretty good.

31:48.966 --> 31:49.889
- Yeah, very good.

31:49.967 --> 31:52.058
- Saad is dead.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.620
We got Chloe back.

31:57.141 --> 31:58.473
It's over.

31:59.309 --> 32:01.810
- Your mission,
it was a public failure.

32:01.828 --> 32:03.587
Everybody knows about it.

32:03.738 --> 32:05.997
Okay? CIA, MI6...

32:06.091 --> 32:07.499
The grapefruits.

32:07.651 --> 32:10.652
See, the grapefruits is
what we called Mossad agents

32:10.654 --> 32:12.262
in Afghanistan.
Because

32:12.414 --> 32:14.339
when they got a hold of the
strong silent types like you,

32:14.416 --> 32:17.434
they peeled their skin back,
like a, like grapes.

32:17.511 --> 32:21.104
Okay. That's option A.
Option B is a full confession.

32:21.181 --> 32:22.347
You tell us what
you were planning,

32:22.424 --> 32:24.424
where you were planning
to do it.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.592
Uh, lay it out for us,
we'll get you a lawyer,

32:26.612 --> 32:30.656
a plea deal and...
all the grapefruits you can eat.

32:33.844 --> 32:35.844
- 50,000 people crowded
together. Perfect target.

32:35.862 --> 32:38.363
Yeah.
- Call the promoters
from that concert at the Mack.

32:38.515 --> 32:41.375
Explain the situation
and tell them we're on our way.

32:42.795 --> 32:45.629
(rock music)

32:50.527 --> 32:52.594
(sirens wailing)

32:58.202 --> 32:59.309
Talk to me, Kemi.

32:59.386 --> 33:00.978
<i> - We've got a report</i>
<i> of a missing child</i>

33:01.129 --> 33:03.054
matching Chloe's description.

33:03.131 --> 33:04.147
She's backstage.

33:04.224 --> 33:07.359
(rock music in the distance)

33:08.303 --> 33:09.060
(cheering)

33:09.213 --> 33:12.155
- Hey. Hi, baby.
I know you.

33:12.307 --> 33:14.640
Huh?
- He said I shouldn't move.

33:15.235 --> 33:17.477
He said he'd hurt me if I did.

33:17.496 --> 33:21.147
- Issue an evacuation order
and find Saad.

33:21.241 --> 33:22.574
- It's a remote detonator.

33:23.410 --> 33:25.485
- How long ago
did he leave you here?

33:25.562 --> 33:26.411
- Two minutes ago.

33:26.563 --> 33:28.154
- He's still in the stadium.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.081
He won't detonate it
until he's gone.

33:30.234 --> 33:31.733
The crowd may buy us some time.

33:31.752 --> 33:32.676
- Yeah. Not enough.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.254
Yo, Hollow-man. It's Jay.

33:36.331 --> 33:37.255
- Jay. What's going on, man?

33:37.332 --> 33:39.090
- I got a situation.

33:39.243 --> 33:40.575
- Uh, yeah. Okay.
What kind of situation?

33:40.594 --> 33:43.186
- The Abbas bunker type
of situation. I need your help.

33:43.263 --> 33:45.930
- You know,
I sell mattresses now.

33:46.083 --> 33:47.249
<i> - Listen to me,</i>

33:47.251 --> 33:49.751
I'm sending you a photo
of a remote detonator.

33:49.770 --> 33:51.361
It's a cell phone. Okay?

33:51.438 --> 33:53.012
- No, dude. Mattresses.
Pillows. Futons.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.680
This is not what I do anymore.

33:54.758 --> 33:58.443
- Beck. Whoever replaced Beck,
send him this photo,

33:58.520 --> 34:00.853
call me back after you speak
to him, please. Okay?

34:00.873 --> 34:03.281
- No, Jay. Jay!

34:03.433 --> 34:07.544
- Hey. See this bracelet?

34:08.121 --> 34:11.364
My son, our son,
gave me this bracelet.

34:11.383 --> 34:12.957
It's got good luck in it.

34:13.110 --> 34:14.384
Every time I'm scared,

34:14.461 --> 34:16.127
I touch it
and good things happen.

34:16.280 --> 34:17.888
If you touch it, I promise
nothing bad will happen.

34:17.964 --> 34:20.432
Do you wanna give it a try?

34:22.636 --> 34:24.728
Good. Momma?

34:28.292 --> 34:29.140
Good.

34:29.293 --> 34:30.959
- Kemi, I need you
to do something.

34:30.977 --> 34:32.127
It's not by the book.

34:32.145 --> 34:33.645
- If it helps find Chloe,

34:33.721 --> 34:36.364
I'm ready to burn the book.
How can I help?

34:38.485 --> 34:40.744
(alarm sounding)

34:42.230 --> 34:45.457
(indistinct chatter)

34:48.754 --> 34:50.587
- Hey, that's my phone.

34:55.335 --> 34:57.168
- Move! Get back! Get back!

34:57.321 --> 34:59.096
(people complaining)
Move! Move!

34:59.247 --> 35:02.824
- Wait, is that that guy?
- That's him! That's him!

35:02.843 --> 35:03.842
- That's that guy!

35:03.994 --> 35:05.435
- What's up, man?

35:05.587 --> 35:07.512
- Uh, so Beck's replacement
says the ringer on the phone

35:07.589 --> 35:09.272
has been disconnected

35:09.349 --> 35:10.941
<i> and the wires attached</i>
<i> to the blasting cap.</i>

35:10.943 --> 35:13.276
So that's three wires,
you know.

35:13.428 --> 35:14.760
I mean, if any of them
are still attached

35:14.780 --> 35:16.279
when the phone rings,
then the cap will be set off.

35:16.398 --> 35:19.190
- Okay. I see the three wires.
Is that it?

35:19.343 --> 35:20.558
<i> - Yeah, that's it.</i>

35:20.619 --> 35:22.768
I mean, as long as there's no
anti-tamper circuit

35:22.846 --> 35:24.454
or a separate capacitor that
actually fires the detonator.

35:24.531 --> 35:26.348
- Okay. How do I find
that thing?

35:26.366 --> 35:28.183
- The replacement had no idea.
Beck was way better.

35:28.185 --> 35:30.610
But, hey, listen,
you ever need half-off

35:30.687 --> 35:32.945
on a great memory foam mattress.
I could definitely hook you up.

35:32.965 --> 35:34.631
- Great. Thank you.

35:35.783 --> 35:36.875
- Jay?

35:36.969 --> 35:40.137
- You're gonna cut
all three of these wires.

35:40.213 --> 35:44.790
- It'll be okay.
We touched the bracelet. Right?

35:44.868 --> 35:48.812
- That's right. That's right.
Keith never let me down.

35:48.889 --> 35:50.463
Go ahead, go ahead.

35:50.983 --> 35:54.376
- We got a hit. Level 4.
Aisle 436.

35:54.394 --> 35:55.727
- Copy that.

35:55.879 --> 35:57.529
(woman screaming)

35:58.882 --> 36:01.116
(indistinct chatter)

36:01.827 --> 36:04.327
(dramatic music)

36:04.888 --> 36:06.663
Saad!

36:08.558 --> 36:10.959
Hey, hey, hey!
Hands where I could see 'em.

36:15.916 --> 36:17.156
- You are too late.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.593
- Hands up or I will shoot.

36:21.513 --> 36:22.904
- Just one more, baby.

36:22.906 --> 36:25.757
- Tell Garber we are even.

36:25.909 --> 36:27.017
An eye for an eye.

36:27.093 --> 36:29.077
A child for a child.

36:29.079 --> 36:30.002
(beeping)

36:30.022 --> 36:32.647
(gunfire)

36:36.920 --> 36:38.937
- It's like I always say...

36:39.089 --> 36:41.072
<i> we get our babies back.</i>

36:48.207 --> 36:50.448
(indistinct chatter)

36:50.784 --> 36:52.876
- Easy. You're okay.

36:53.027 --> 36:54.769
- Chloe! Baby!
- Chloe!

36:54.788 --> 36:56.028
- Ma'am, please!

36:56.048 --> 36:57.789
- Look who's here.

36:57.865 --> 36:59.865
(indistinct chatter)

37:00.460 --> 37:04.387
Well, there's your answer
right there.

37:05.298 --> 37:08.633
That's why I can't invest
in the hunt for Keith.

37:08.785 --> 37:13.104
Because whenever I do, I start
to imagine that could be us.

37:14.291 --> 37:16.716
When I know it never will be.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.318
(phone vibrating)

37:19.053 --> 37:20.553
- Hello?

37:20.814 --> 37:23.798
(sirens wailing)

37:23.800 --> 37:24.991
- Dad?

37:34.828 --> 37:37.629
- Keith Grant. Where is he?

37:42.577 --> 37:43.651
Is it you?

37:43.653 --> 37:45.320
- That's him. That's him.

37:45.322 --> 37:47.097
- You were right. It's Keith.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.725
(laughing)

37:51.603 --> 37:52.978
Oh, my baby!

37:53.680 --> 37:55.105
- It's you, buddy!

37:55.181 --> 37:56.806
- You're hurt. You're hurt!

37:56.883 --> 37:58.349
- So big, you're taller than me.

37:58.426 --> 38:00.835
- You okay, baby?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

38:00.895 --> 38:02.261
- You're cut, you're bruised.

38:02.339 --> 38:04.689
- There was a ransom,
we weren't able to do anything.

38:04.766 --> 38:08.676
So the guy, your kidnapper guy,
where is he? I want to find him.

38:08.678 --> 38:10.011
- I know, I know...

38:10.030 --> 38:12.196
We have to talk about
what happened.

38:12.273 --> 38:15.366
But right now, do you think
we could maybe just go home?

38:15.519 --> 38:18.778
- You are skin and bone.
Didn't anybody feed you?

38:18.797 --> 38:21.256
- None of your blueberry
pancakes.

38:23.026 --> 38:24.042
- You remembered.

38:24.118 --> 38:25.543
- Remember?
(laughing)

38:25.695 --> 38:28.713
How could I forget?
- I recognize his eyes.

38:28.865 --> 38:32.458
- Yeah. We're going home. Okay?
It's over. Alright?

38:32.536 --> 38:35.219
- Let's go home.
- I told you.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.962
- You told me what?
What'd you tell me?

38:36.982 --> 38:38.873
- I told the bracelet's
good luck.

38:38.875 --> 38:40.650
- Right. Could we get out
of here, please?

38:40.727 --> 38:42.544
Can we leave?

38:42.546 --> 38:44.529
<i> - Hey, Sidney, we're back!</i>

38:45.715 --> 38:46.881
(laughing)

38:46.900 --> 38:48.399
(dog barking)

38:48.552 --> 38:49.475
- Hey, shh!

38:49.494 --> 38:51.143
- Hey.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.955
Sorry. She doesn't
recognize you.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.315
But I do.
I know who you are.

38:56.393 --> 38:58.910
- Sidney, am I glad
to see you!

38:59.004 --> 39:00.962
- I never thought
I'd see you again.

39:01.731 --> 39:02.839
But here you are.

39:02.916 --> 39:05.400
It's a miracle.
(barking)

39:05.418 --> 39:06.734
- Sidney. Sidney,

39:06.736 --> 39:08.920
can you take this barking hound
outside, please?

39:08.996 --> 39:10.847
- Come on.
- I'm gonna get started

39:10.924 --> 39:12.682
on the pancakes.
Jay, set the table.

39:12.834 --> 39:15.101
- Okay, alright. You alright?

39:16.003 --> 39:17.645
Huh? Come on.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.583
You sit down,
I'll find the forks.

39:21.585 --> 39:23.026
Okay?
- Okay.

39:24.104 --> 39:25.344
- Hey.

39:25.364 --> 39:28.156
You're never gonna believe
who I'm looking at.

39:32.762 --> 39:35.997
(screaming for joy)

39:36.950 --> 39:38.875
(soft music)

39:39.026 --> 39:43.121
♪ Life is sweet
but time is borrowed ♪

39:43.197 --> 39:47.217

40:12.577 --> 40:15.245
- You have no idea
how happy this makes me.

40:15.321 --> 40:18.581
But it's... how I remember it.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.658
Every picture.

40:21.402 --> 40:24.003
Every trophy and blanket.

40:25.482 --> 40:27.966
Every Magic the Gathering card.

40:31.655 --> 40:33.412
All of this.

40:33.432 --> 40:36.057
Thinking about it,
about home.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.144
It kept me alive.

40:42.441 --> 40:44.999
- I'm afraid none
of your pajamas will fit.

40:45.518 --> 40:47.259
- Yeah, I'll... I'll be fine.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.670
(laughing)
Don't worry.

40:48.688 --> 40:50.447
- Hey, hey. Nobody's worried
about anything.

40:50.598 --> 40:53.432
You are home. Okay?
There's nothing to worry about.

40:53.510 --> 40:55.677
Come on, get out.
- Okay, I'm coming.

40:55.695 --> 40:57.287
(clears throat)

40:57.438 --> 40:58.696
- Alright.

40:58.848 --> 41:00.682
- Just call if you need
anything.

41:00.684 --> 41:02.959
- Okay. Thank you.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.277
- I am so happy for you.

41:05.297 --> 41:07.355
And for Keith.
I can't wait to meet him.

41:07.357 --> 41:09.782
- That's right.
You've never met!

41:09.859 --> 41:12.043
This is all so crazy.

41:12.119 --> 41:13.211
- Crazy good.
Crazy great!

41:13.363 --> 41:15.046
<i> It's crazy great!</i>
(laughing)

41:15.198 --> 41:16.380
- Oh. Hey, Jay.

41:16.457 --> 41:18.032
- Oh. Thank you.

41:18.034 --> 41:19.625
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

41:19.644 --> 41:22.537
Thank you for everything.
For keeping me sane.

41:22.539 --> 41:23.646
For...

41:23.815 --> 41:27.317
<i> for suggesting that Jay</i>
<i> should join the team.</i>

41:27.468 --> 41:29.468
<i> I think it'll be good for us.</i>

41:29.488 --> 41:30.895
- Oh. Really?

41:30.989 --> 41:33.156
I thought you said
he wouldn't do it.

41:33.307 --> 41:35.883
- I didn't think
he'd want to.

41:35.977 --> 41:37.494
But he does.

41:37.645 --> 41:39.645
<i> - Okay, great.</i>

41:39.723 --> 41:42.223
(rhythmic music)
But, and I'm just curious,

41:42.225 --> 41:45.076
when you say that'll be
"good for us", which "us"?

41:45.228 --> 41:47.061
- Us us, silly.

41:47.063 --> 41:48.630
All of us.

41:49.566 --> 41:50.748
- Yeah. All of us.

41:50.825 --> 41:52.759
Yeah, I can see that.

41:58.591 --> 42:00.241
So what do you think?

42:00.835 --> 42:02.760
Should I come over tonight?

42:02.837 --> 42:04.521
<i>- You can come over every night.</i>

42:04.597 --> 42:08.583
<i> Any night.</i>
<i> Just... maybe not tonight.</i>

42:09.252 --> 42:14.572
<i> I just... I don't wanna</i>
<i> overwhelm Keith, you know?</i>

42:15.367 --> 42:17.091
- No, yeah, yeah. Of course.

42:17.093 --> 42:19.260
Keith has to come first.

42:19.279 --> 42:21.037
Keith and your family.

42:21.948 --> 42:23.522
Go.

42:23.600 --> 42:24.356
Celebrate.

42:24.376 --> 42:27.710
<i> - Oh yeah. Trust me. I will!</i>

42:36.963 --> 42:38.203
- Ah.

42:38.298 --> 42:40.139
- I have a genius idea.

42:44.729 --> 42:47.212
- Oh, look at this little dude.

42:47.232 --> 42:48.898
- Look at that face.

42:48.975 --> 42:52.402
- This is Jamaica, right?
I haven't seen these in so long.

42:52.478 --> 42:54.237
- I know. And I haven't looked.

42:54.314 --> 42:55.980
This is... I mean, I did.

42:56.057 --> 42:58.649
I did one time,
but it was too painful.

42:58.802 --> 43:03.079
It's like the better the memory,
the worse it felt.

43:04.032 --> 43:05.990
- It's crazy.
We got more than our son back.

43:06.142 --> 43:09.919
We just got back our past
and our future.

43:48.685 --> 43:50.852
- Goodnight, baby.

43:50.854 --> 43:52.019
Love you.
