00:00.198 --> 00:02.044
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:02.111 --> 00:04.680
Country won't recover
until we have a vice president.

00:04.747 --> 00:06.782
He won't be confirmed.
Not with what I know.

00:06.849 --> 00:09.084
There's nothing in my background
that'll embarrass you.

00:09.151 --> 00:11.687
Don't you worry about a thing.
It's done. Buried.

00:11.754 --> 00:13.589
- I won't forget.
- I'm counting on that.

00:13.656 --> 00:14.890
We own him.

00:14.957 --> 00:17.560
You're keeping a secret
puts the administration at risk.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.695
I felt it was a private thing.

00:19.762 --> 00:21.897
- We haven't found the crash site.
- What was on board?

00:21.964 --> 00:25.067
One hundred of our latest generation
Block III Stinger missiles.

00:25.134 --> 00:27.469
The group leader found
50 handheld launchers.

00:27.536 --> 00:30.072
- And the other 50?
- Missing. They're out there.

00:34.276 --> 00:38.147
[woman] ...civil unrest continue
in Prince George's County today.

00:38.214 --> 00:42.284
Many mothers, wives, and daughters
in Hyattsville and Langley Park

00:42.351 --> 00:44.753
have taken their concerns
to the streets.

00:44.820 --> 00:48.891
They're fed up with the increasing
number of murders in their communities.

00:48.958 --> 00:51.360
They are demanding more
investigative follow up

00:51.427 --> 00:54.296
and increased protection
on the part of police.

00:54.363 --> 00:57.800
Now, county supervisors, thus far,
have declined to comment,

00:57.866 --> 01:00.970
but there is growing concern
the protests could escalate

01:01.036 --> 01:03.939
if action isn't taken soon.

01:04.006 --> 01:06.709
- [women chanting]
- [male reporter indistinct]

01:06.800 --> 01:09.503
...some protesters are
turning to other methods.

01:09.545 --> 01:11.347
One mother has gone
on a hunger strike

01:11.413 --> 01:14.016
until police arrest a suspect
in her son's slaying.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.484
[phone beeping]

01:17.886 --> 01:20.522
Carl, I knew you'd be up.

01:20.589 --> 01:24.059
I have someone from CRS heading
over to assess the situation.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.595
The protests have spread
to other communities.

01:26.662 --> 01:28.797
All in Maryland.
I'm getting you the stats.

01:28.864 --> 01:31.533
Good. Good.
Carl, thanks for coming in so early.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.504
Oh, sure. By the way, I, uh, I was
sleeping when you called last night.

01:35.571 --> 01:38.207
I was doing that whole
"I was awake" thing with my voice

01:38.274 --> 01:40.976
in case attorney generals
aren't supposed to sleep.

01:41.043 --> 01:44.113
Carl, am I overreacting
to be so concerned about this?

01:44.179 --> 01:48.984
I don't think so. No. It doesn't take
much for protests to turn into riots.

01:49.051 --> 01:50.819
- I'll see you later.
- Sir.

01:50.886 --> 01:52.421
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.990
The NSC and CIA directors
are in the Oval Office.

01:55.057 --> 01:58.260
Intelligence briefing isn't until 7:30.

01:59.128 --> 02:00.129
Thank you.

02:00.195 --> 02:01.563
- Morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

02:01.630 --> 02:05.134
Thought you'd wanna know, we've
got a lead on the missing Stingers.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.470
This may be the first time you've
brought me good news, Anthony.

02:08.537 --> 02:11.473
A field operative in Prague
was approached by a weapons dealer

02:11.540 --> 02:12.841
named Jan Mannus.

02:12.908 --> 02:16.312
He was asked to negotiate
the sale of 50 state-of-the-art

02:16.378 --> 02:17.713
surface-to-air missiles.

02:17.780 --> 02:19.515
We're sure these are our weapons?

02:19.581 --> 02:22.084
The third party showed one to him.
Definitely ours.

02:22.151 --> 02:24.219
Then he knows where
the weapons are kept.

02:24.286 --> 02:26.088
No. Only that when a buyer was found,

02:26.155 --> 02:28.490
the weapons could be
delivered inside two hours.

02:28.557 --> 02:31.327
Meaning every potential target
on the continent is at risk.

02:31.393 --> 02:34.163
Will he lead us to the seller?
Is he trustworthy?

02:34.229 --> 02:37.066
The agency's used him
as an intelligence asset many times.

02:37.132 --> 02:40.102
- His information always checked out.
- Has Warren weighed in?

02:40.169 --> 02:43.605
We were unable to reach the vice
president this morning. I left word.

02:44.340 --> 02:46.141
OK. Let's continue our search.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.777
But tell Mannus we'll work with him
if he will with us.

02:48.844 --> 02:50.412
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

02:51.347 --> 02:54.550
You're known for being tough on terror,
but with the Templeton Act,

02:54.616 --> 02:57.052
you've turned your focus
to domestic crime.

02:57.119 --> 02:59.088
Why the shift?
Is it, as some are saying,

02:59.154 --> 03:02.391
a chance for you to pander
to panicked soccer moms

03:02.458 --> 03:04.426
in a rumored presidential bid?

03:04.493 --> 03:06.895
You know, listen, this bill of mine

03:06.962 --> 03:09.565
streamlines the appeals process,

03:09.631 --> 03:12.568
closes the loopholes in Three Strikes,

03:12.634 --> 03:16.605
increases the mandatory
minimum for drug offenders.

03:16.672 --> 03:19.775
If you take criminals
off the streets, Gordon,

03:19.842 --> 03:21.710
crime is reduced, end of story.

03:21.777 --> 03:25.881
Mr. Speaker, you've had a long
and remarkable career,

03:25.948 --> 03:29.084
and yet you've never attached
your name to a bill before.

03:29.151 --> 03:32.454
Is it fair to say this is the one
you want to be remembered by?

03:32.521 --> 03:37.960
Honestly?
Nothing would make me prouder.

03:38.327 --> 03:41.597
If the Templeton Act lands on the
president's desk in its current form,

03:41.663 --> 03:43.532
she'll be forced to veto it.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.801
I don't know how much
simpler I can put it.

03:45.868 --> 03:48.604
The speaker's bill
focuses on punishment and prisons.

03:48.670 --> 03:51.006
The president believes
that the taxpayer money

03:51.073 --> 03:53.375
is better spent on policing
and prevention.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.476
[knocking]

03:54.543 --> 03:59.348
Well, look, I would take more cops
over more stockades any day.

03:59.415 --> 04:02.818
Yes, that's on the record.
You're welcome.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.320
[sighs] Walk you to senior staff?

04:05.387 --> 04:08.757
Know what's sad? That's as close as
I've come to being asked out in weeks.

04:08.824 --> 04:12.127
I know. If you come to work when
it's dark, and leave when it's dark,

04:12.194 --> 04:13.829
did the day actually happen?

04:13.896 --> 04:16.165
Keep this up and
you're going to get jilted.

04:16.231 --> 04:17.933
Josh has been calling me Lady Di.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.136
Because, you see, there are
three people in this marriage.

04:21.202 --> 04:23.071
Speaking of which,
did you ask her yet?

04:23.138 --> 04:26.408
The president? No. I don't want
to put her on the spot like that.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.578
Far be it from me to advise anyone
on their personal life,

04:29.645 --> 04:32.347
but she'd be hurt if you didn't
ask her to the ceremony.

04:32.414 --> 04:35.050
- Someone getting married?
- Something like that.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.488
[Jim] Where are we
on this airline pilot strike?

04:39.555 --> 04:42.257
NLRB is scheduling mediation
for Tuesday next.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.661
Catch Templeton peddling his crime bill
on Gordon Blake this morning?

04:45.727 --> 04:48.897
- Does anyone watch Gordon Blake?
- Did somebody change the subject?

04:48.964 --> 04:51.700
- What's the latest tally?
- Closer than it was in the house,

04:51.767 --> 04:54.670
- but still expected to gain passage.
- She can't veto.

04:54.736 --> 04:57.406
Why can't she?

04:57.473 --> 04:58.474
- Ma'am.
- Please.

04:58.540 --> 05:00.642
With the hit we took
with the AG confirmation,

05:00.709 --> 05:03.145
we're better off grabbing
the speaker's coattails.

05:03.212 --> 05:04.446
I'm a former prosecutor.

05:04.513 --> 05:08.016
I don't need the speaker's coattails
to prove that I'm tough on crime.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.819
But you stop it with more police,
more education,

05:10.886 --> 05:13.889
more community involvement,
not harsher sentencing.

05:13.956 --> 05:16.258
That nuance doesn't play
in a 30-second spot.

05:16.325 --> 05:18.727
Sage advice, but I'm vetoing the bill.
What's next?

05:18.794 --> 05:21.530
Advance expects coverage
at the first gentleman's speech

05:21.597 --> 05:23.198
at the Youth Council gala.

05:23.265 --> 05:25.834
Teen People hopes to do a blurb
on Horace attending.

05:25.901 --> 05:28.303
Let's stick to the rule.
No press for the kids.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.905
Vince. Need me?

05:29.972 --> 05:33.342
Actually, Mr. Gardner has a visitor
calling from the northwest gate.

05:33.408 --> 05:37.646
Louis Highsmith. Said you might
know him better as Bobo?

05:41.316 --> 05:43.352
Excuse me.

05:46.121 --> 05:48.357
- [horns honking]
- [whistle blows]

05:48.423 --> 05:50.893
- [screaming]
- [sirens]

05:57.032 --> 05:58.534
- [man] Mr. Calloway!
- Hi!

05:58.600 --> 06:00.469
[screaming continues]

06:06.508 --> 06:07.543
Want an autograph?

06:07.609 --> 06:08.810
- Yes.
- All right.

06:08.877 --> 06:11.079
- Thank you so much.
- Will you sign my t-shirt?

06:11.146 --> 06:13.315
- Sure.
- Hey, Horace,

06:13.382 --> 06:15.751
stick to paper if you know
what's good for you.

06:15.817 --> 06:17.986
- Thank you.
- Have a good one.

06:18.053 --> 06:20.422
- Do you want an autograph?
- Actually...

06:30.232 --> 06:31.667
[chuckles]

06:34.469 --> 06:36.171
Jimmy, it's good to see you, man.

06:36.238 --> 06:39.007
- I know this is out of the blue...
- It's been a while.

06:39.074 --> 06:42.844
Well, I've seen you on TV
and in the papers

06:42.911 --> 06:45.514
and, you know, I've never been one
to ask for favors...

06:45.581 --> 06:49.084
I'm sorry. I got a conference call.
You mind walking while we talk?

06:49.151 --> 06:51.253
Sure, sure.

06:52.287 --> 06:55.324
That Creole place still there?
What was it called? Big Tiny?

06:55.390 --> 06:59.628
Nah, that got torn down years ago.
Low income high-rise there now.

06:59.695 --> 07:02.297
- You got the write-up on the summit?
- Within the hour.

07:03.966 --> 07:07.369
You remember Theresa, right?

07:07.436 --> 07:10.606
- Probably heard we got married.
- I did, yeah. How's she doin'?

07:12.574 --> 07:15.611
She got killed, man.

07:15.677 --> 07:18.780
Four days ago. Shot.

07:28.223 --> 07:31.660
[sobbing]

07:31.727 --> 07:34.096
I'm so sorry.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.366
Some punk looking for drug money.

07:37.432 --> 07:39.835
I'd just dropped her off at work.

07:39.901 --> 07:43.672
Maybe 20 feet away
from where it happened.

07:44.873 --> 07:47.976
Police haven't even
taken my statement yet.

07:48.043 --> 07:51.113
- Well, I'm sure that they will.
- No, they won't. They don't.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.349
The last six months, 11 people
have been killed in Hyattsville.

07:54.416 --> 07:57.486
Terry's the 12th.
And nobody's done anything.

07:59.421 --> 08:01.189
We got kids, me and Terry.

08:01.256 --> 08:06.495
I can't tell them their mother's
a number no one gives a damn about.

08:06.561 --> 08:09.598
Excuse me, Mr. Gardner.
The call's on the line.

08:13.502 --> 08:16.038
I'm not sure what I can do here.

08:20.909 --> 08:25.714
Yeah, well, just whatever
you can see your way to.

08:30.786 --> 08:32.421
I'll let you get back to work.

08:33.587 --> 08:35.957
Vince will show you out.

08:36.024 --> 08:37.759
Take care of yourself.

08:43.030 --> 08:46.535
So, uh, was that the mysterious Bobo?

08:46.601 --> 08:49.371
An old friend asking for a favor.

08:49.438 --> 08:52.841
Oh, yeah. Give me the president's
autograph, can she abolish taxes...

08:52.908 --> 08:57.079
- I get it all the time.
- His wife was murdered.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.716
Oh. Jim, I'm sorry. I had no idea.

09:00.782 --> 09:04.186
[Mac indistinct]

09:04.252 --> 09:07.089
- Dickie, good work on that focus group.
- Thank you, ma'am.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.024
Do you have time
to go over the results?

09:09.091 --> 09:10.792
Sure.

09:14.896 --> 09:17.733
Need something, Jim?

09:17.799 --> 09:21.002
No, ma'am. Thank you.

09:41.757 --> 09:44.292
After the speech, we present
the Hagen Scholarship

09:44.359 --> 09:47.829
to the five young people who logged
the most hours of community service

09:47.896 --> 09:49.831
and call Horace up on stage.

09:49.898 --> 09:52.834
- Hey, that's great.
- By the way, like the beard.

09:52.901 --> 09:54.336
You're the only one.

09:54.402 --> 09:56.938
Here's one of our
scholarship winners now. Molly.

09:57.005 --> 10:00.075
Mr. Calloway, Horace,
meet Molly Parker.

10:00.142 --> 10:03.245
Molly is leading the rebuilding effort
of the Episcopal Church

10:03.311 --> 10:05.647
- in her town after a tornado hit.
- [Rod] Really.

10:05.714 --> 10:09.351
My parents were married there.
My brother and I were baptized there.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.753
- Sounds cool.
- Sounds like a special place.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.489
- This is you.
- Excuse me.

10:14.556 --> 10:16.725
- Mr. Rod Calloway.
- [applause]

10:22.230 --> 10:23.799
[Rod] Thank you.

10:23.865 --> 10:26.168
You know, I have spent the last hour

10:26.234 --> 10:29.304
listening to some of the
inspiring works being done...

10:29.371 --> 10:32.874
I can't believe I'm hanging out
with the president's son.

10:32.941 --> 10:37.345
[Rod] Well, that's not good enough.
Molly, can I speak to you?

10:37.412 --> 10:39.848
Uh, Molly? I'm going to
make a deal with you.

10:39.915 --> 10:42.551
You finish building that church,

10:42.617 --> 10:46.354
and I'm going to be at your very first
Sunday service. What do you think?

10:46.421 --> 10:48.557
- [applause]
- Fair?

10:51.827 --> 10:54.963
I just think there's a danger
in being seen as a president

10:55.030 --> 10:59.034
who intervenes every time a local
crisis can't be handled locally.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.403
It's hypocritical to focus
on national issues

11:01.469 --> 11:04.940
when this is happening in my backyard,
which is what we're talking about.

11:05.006 --> 11:07.375
- Sorry. Gaggle ran long.
- That's OK.

11:07.442 --> 11:09.611
Carl was lecturing me
on State's rights.

11:09.678 --> 11:12.781
Thinks I should keep my nose
out of Prince George's County.

11:12.848 --> 11:14.583
I was more graceful than that.

11:14.649 --> 11:16.618
PG County.
Isn't that where you're from?

11:19.187 --> 11:22.123
We've been talking about this.
Why didn't you mention it?

11:22.190 --> 11:24.059
It didn't seem relevant.

11:24.125 --> 11:26.461
It's a local situation.
Not a national one.

11:26.528 --> 11:29.197
A president shouldn't be
concerned with local issues?

11:29.264 --> 11:31.533
No. I'm saying that
we risk looking like

11:31.600 --> 11:35.237
- a big government in a small pond.
- The point I was trying to make.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.472
Ma'am, they're asking for you
in the Sit Room.

11:37.539 --> 11:39.975
Thank you, Vince. Uh, Jim?

11:40.041 --> 11:42.911
Get the Governor of Maryland.
See if we can help him out.

11:42.978 --> 11:44.579
Yes, ma'am.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.716
And I'm telling you,
you're making a mistake.

11:47.782 --> 11:49.184
Ten-hut.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.453
Good morning to you, too, Warren.

11:51.519 --> 11:54.055
We cannot make a deal
with this character Mannus.

11:54.122 --> 11:56.625
- You know him?
- We crossed paths in uniform.

11:56.691 --> 11:58.660
I wouldn't trust him to park my car.

11:58.727 --> 12:02.530
He sells weapons to terrorists and he
will find some way to double-cross us.

12:02.597 --> 12:05.800
Ma'am, Mannus has agreed
to lead us to the missile seller.

12:05.867 --> 12:08.236
- We've negotiated a deal with him.
- Which is?

12:08.303 --> 12:10.672
He's asking for a $20 million
broker's fee.

12:10.739 --> 12:12.741
- Is that all?
- Pretty standard rate.

12:12.807 --> 12:15.377
Why would he accept
a $20 million fee

12:15.443 --> 12:17.579
when the weapons are worth
five times that?

12:17.646 --> 12:20.348
His associations with us
have benefited him greatly.

12:20.415 --> 12:22.617
- He'd be crazy to jeopardize that.
- Oh, yeah.

12:22.684 --> 12:25.620
An illegal arms dealer
would never do anything crazy.

12:25.687 --> 12:29.024
Ma'am, right now Mannus
is the only contact we have.

12:30.558 --> 12:33.528
The fact is, he could be
working us any number of ways.

12:33.595 --> 12:37.332
He could already have the weapons.
He could have lied from the beginning.

12:37.399 --> 12:40.969
But until we find the weapons ourselves,
we need to keep using him.

12:41.036 --> 12:43.605
Your call, ma'am.

12:49.744 --> 12:52.013
Oh, just the person I wanted to see.

12:52.080 --> 12:56.351
- What can I do for you, Dickie?
- Uh...

12:56.418 --> 12:59.187
...protect my boss and yours.

12:59.254 --> 13:01.623
I did some sniffing around.

13:01.690 --> 13:05.527
You and Vince are good buddies, right?
You socialize, hang out.

13:05.593 --> 13:06.628
Your point being?

13:06.695 --> 13:10.165
I need you to tell him,
friend to friend,

13:10.231 --> 13:13.101
that, in retrospect, you think
it would be a bad idea for him

13:13.168 --> 13:16.171
to let the president in
on his upcoming nuptials.

13:16.237 --> 13:17.372
Why would I do that?

13:17.439 --> 13:21.910
Because, it'll cross-pressure her base
with women and kill her over 65's.

13:21.977 --> 13:23.712
Not in the context of civil unions.

13:23.778 --> 13:26.247
She cannot hide behind
semantics on this issue.

13:26.314 --> 13:28.917
This isn't an issue.
It's Vince and his partner...

13:28.984 --> 13:30.185
Yes. I know.

13:30.251 --> 13:32.754
There's a time and place
for that sorta thing...

13:32.821 --> 13:35.690
...after the election cycle.

13:35.757 --> 13:37.192
You know what?

13:37.258 --> 13:40.295
This is absolutely
none of your business.

13:42.130 --> 13:44.032
[door slams]

13:44.466 --> 13:47.202
[man] As staged sit-ins
and traffic blockades increase,

13:47.268 --> 13:49.070
some are turning to other methods.

13:49.137 --> 13:52.407
One mother has gone on a hunger strike
until police arrest a suspect

13:52.474 --> 13:53.942
in her son's slaying.

13:54.009 --> 13:56.378
[Jayne] It's getting ugly out there.

13:56.444 --> 13:59.647
Not to leave this room,
of course, but

13:59.714 --> 14:03.585
this business in Maryland,
tragic as it is,

14:03.651 --> 14:06.354
couldn't have come
at a better time.

14:06.421 --> 14:09.624
Whip says we're holding at 52-48.

14:09.691 --> 14:13.528
Which means next week this time,
the Templeton Act will be law.

14:15.196 --> 14:16.865
Unless she vetoes, of course.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.668
Jim says she's determined
to shut it down.

14:23.738 --> 14:27.042
I guess it's safe to say
this isn't a social call.

14:27.108 --> 14:30.779
You have 12 unsolved murders
in one neighborhood

14:30.845 --> 14:32.380
and protestors on the streets.

14:32.447 --> 14:34.949
We're doing everything
to contain the situation.

14:35.016 --> 14:38.686
The president is aware of the problem
and wants to offer her help.

14:38.753 --> 14:42.190
Does she? Or does she just want to
make up for lost polling points?

14:42.257 --> 14:45.126
- Governor, thank you for coming in.
- Of course.

14:45.193 --> 14:47.162
With all due respect,
all I'm trying to say

14:47.228 --> 14:49.431
is that this is a waste
of your valuable time.

14:49.497 --> 14:52.233
We have a problem
in Prince George's County.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.069
We are taking steps to remedy it.

14:54.135 --> 14:55.870
Glad to hear it.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.273
We just wanted to see
if we could help you figure out

14:58.339 --> 15:01.209
where your resources
might best be directed.

15:01.276 --> 15:05.180
The funding for local law enforcement
is distributed on a per capita basis.

15:05.246 --> 15:10.652
Hyattsville has ten times the crime
of Bethesda, Potomac, or Chevy Chase.

15:10.718 --> 15:13.555
This is not a per capita issue.
You need more police officers.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.657
Give me a grant
and I'll hire more troopers.

15:15.723 --> 15:19.160
Or you could re-assign troopers
to PG County

15:19.227 --> 15:22.163
until this murder epidemic
is under control.

15:23.965 --> 15:28.269
All this attention on one community.
Do you mind if I ask why?

15:28.336 --> 15:31.606
We have to start somewhere.
We might as well start in the community

15:31.673 --> 15:35.276
with one of the fastest growing
crime rates in the country.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.680
I will consider your recommendation.

15:38.746 --> 15:40.982
- Thank you, governor.
- Thank you.

15:44.085 --> 15:45.553
That went well.

15:49.924 --> 15:51.659
[knocking]

15:51.726 --> 15:53.161
Ma'am, may I?

15:54.529 --> 15:55.697
Warren.

15:55.897 --> 15:57.031
[sighs]

15:57.098 --> 16:00.335
I wanted to apologize
for being curt before.

16:01.736 --> 16:03.738
Thank you. I appreciate that.

16:03.805 --> 16:06.508
You've been a great help to me
in all of this.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.443
- Ma'am.
- Sorry to interrupt.

16:08.510 --> 16:11.746
The CIA just picked up some
disturbing intelligence on Mannus.

16:11.813 --> 16:14.149
Looks like our $20 million
didn't buy us much.

16:14.215 --> 16:16.518
- He made a deal to sell the missiles.
- To whom?

16:16.584 --> 16:17.919
The Islamic Jihad Front.

16:17.986 --> 16:19.988
[Warren] That is what
I said would happen.

16:20.054 --> 16:23.191
He was never trying to get us
the missiles back. He was playing us.

16:23.258 --> 16:25.193
Hopefully we found out in time.

16:25.260 --> 16:28.429
If the Islamic Jihad Front
gets those weapons, they'll use them.

16:28.496 --> 16:31.833
Our focus has to be on gathering
enough intelligence to disrupt the sale

16:31.900 --> 16:33.468
and recover the missiles.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.203
Tell me our intelligence is so bad,

16:35.270 --> 16:38.072
we don't know if he's negotiating
with more than one buyer.

16:38.139 --> 16:40.842
He can be playing terrorist groups
off against each other

16:40.909 --> 16:44.012
- to jack up the price.
- Let him sell to the highest bidder.

16:44.078 --> 16:48.149
We'll send in CIA operatives
posing as terrorist buyers,

16:48.216 --> 16:50.718
make the highest bid,
get the weapons, and arrest him.

16:50.785 --> 16:54.756
If Mannus sells military technology
to a non-sanctioned,

16:54.822 --> 16:56.758
non-governmental entity,

16:56.824 --> 17:01.029
he's just broken about two dozen
American, Dutch, and international laws.

17:01.095 --> 17:03.765
Let's get on this, Tony.
We'll report back, ma'am.

17:03.831 --> 17:05.098
Thank you.

17:05.165 --> 17:08.903
Did you talk to Horace or your dad?

17:08.970 --> 17:11.906
- Huh?
- Did you talk to Horace or your dad?

17:11.973 --> 17:14.242
Oh, yeah, Horace. Just now.

17:14.309 --> 17:17.679
- Oh, I didn't hear the phone.
- He IM'd me.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.814
Um, you know, instant messaging?

17:19.881 --> 17:22.817
When someone types you something
and you type back online,

17:22.884 --> 17:24.085
without having to talk.

17:24.152 --> 17:27.821
So you can do other things,
like surf the Net or download MP3 files.

17:27.888 --> 17:30.892
- Stuff like that.
- I know what IM'ing is.

17:32.493 --> 17:34.395
- Oh.
- Having a typed conversation

17:34.462 --> 17:36.864
during which you're
half paying attention.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.834
Do you even know this person,
or is that too retro?

17:39.901 --> 17:44.072
- Grandma. I don't ask you about Bill.
- You could.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.984
- Jim?
- Ma'am?

17:56.951 --> 18:01.289
Have you noticed anything unusual
about Warren lately?

18:02.357 --> 18:03.758
No. Why?

18:03.825 --> 18:08.396
I don't know if he feels under-utilized
or overburdened,

18:08.463 --> 18:10.865
but he just hasn't been himself.

18:10.932 --> 18:13.534
I doubt if he'd tell you
if there were something wrong.

18:13.601 --> 18:16.037
He's a... private man.

18:16.104 --> 18:18.306
He is. As are you.

18:20.174 --> 18:22.944
Jim, Theresa Highsmith

18:23.011 --> 18:26.981
is the name of the latest
murder victim in Hyattsville.

18:27.048 --> 18:31.219
Any connection with your visitor
this morning?

18:35.056 --> 18:37.558
She was his wife.

18:39.427 --> 18:40.928
Why didn't you tell me?

18:43.164 --> 18:46.601
I didn't want to impose upon you.
I, uh...

18:46.668 --> 18:48.770
I didn't know what to do.

18:50.571 --> 18:51.873
You were close?

18:53.041 --> 18:55.677
We were, uh, old classmates.

18:57.078 --> 19:01.349
Terry and I dated actually.
I even took her to the junior prom.

19:01.416 --> 19:04.786
She was my first kiss.

19:07.088 --> 19:10.058
Feels like a million years ago.

19:11.893 --> 19:13.594
I wanna help if I can, Jim.

19:15.330 --> 19:17.765
That's up to you, ma'am.

19:17.832 --> 19:20.301
But I'm not asking you to.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.881
- [pop music]
- Hi.

19:33.948 --> 19:36.951
- Hey.
- I didn't think you were coming.

19:37.018 --> 19:40.054
Well, here I am.

19:40.121 --> 19:41.889
Yeah.

19:48.162 --> 19:49.664
[woman] In Annapolis today,

19:49.731 --> 19:52.300
Governor Preston kicked off
his re-election campaign

19:52.367 --> 19:54.702
with a gala fundraiser
at the convention center.

19:54.769 --> 19:58.506
Extra police were called in
for the event as the popular incumbent

19:58.573 --> 20:01.743
drew a crowd of business
executives and political leaders.

20:01.809 --> 20:04.212
It's as if you never even
had the conversation.

20:04.278 --> 20:06.748
He'll double police presence
for a fundraiser,

20:06.814 --> 20:10.551
but he won't assign more to the county
with the fastest-growing crime rate.

20:10.618 --> 20:11.886
It's a slap in the face.

20:11.953 --> 20:16.824
Jim, has a sitting president
ever visited Hyattsville?

20:31.005 --> 20:33.574
- Nice try.
- Oh, hey.

20:34.809 --> 20:37.779
Sick of it already, huh?
The beard.

20:37.845 --> 20:41.849
- So you want to talk about this?
- Not really.

20:41.916 --> 20:44.385
Well, that's too bad
'cause we're going to.

20:44.452 --> 20:47.121
- [sighs]
- Do you care about this girl?

20:47.188 --> 20:48.689
- Or...
- [scoffs]

20:48.756 --> 20:54.195
You gotta have respect, Horace.
For yourself and...

20:54.262 --> 20:56.264
- ...for whomever you're with.
- I know.

20:56.330 --> 20:58.332
Good. Good.

20:58.399 --> 21:01.335
You know, sometimes the things
that we think we want,

21:01.402 --> 21:03.438
will get us into trouble.

21:07.275 --> 21:08.843
- Wow.
- I couldn't believe it.

21:08.910 --> 21:13.414
Hey, look.
Great with my dress, right?

21:13.481 --> 21:16.217
Gorgeous. Love it.

21:16.284 --> 21:18.319
Yeah. I hope they
have a return policy.

21:18.386 --> 21:19.554
Why?

21:21.255 --> 21:23.891
We're not gonna have it.
The ceremony.

21:23.958 --> 21:26.961
I mean, we are, but just
the two of us and not in D.C.

21:27.028 --> 21:30.498
- We're gonna go to Vermont.
- You're kidding me, right?

21:30.565 --> 21:32.633
I just think it's better this way.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.203
Better for who?
What...? What happened?

21:35.269 --> 21:38.272
- Nothing.
- Don't look at me.

21:38.339 --> 21:41.242
Who talked to you? Dickie?

21:41.309 --> 21:44.679
Look. We'll take a lot of pictures.
It'll be fine. OK?

21:44.745 --> 21:47.849
- I, uh... I gotta go to work.
- Bye.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.753
- [chattering]
- What have we got?

21:52.820 --> 21:54.856
We just got a coded message
from Wurzburg.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.658
They recovered all 50 missiles intact.

21:57.725 --> 22:00.761
- Good.
- Unfortunately, Mannus got away.

22:00.828 --> 22:03.331
Our people had to make
some fast choices, ma'am.

22:03.397 --> 22:05.566
They decided the priority
was the missiles.

22:05.633 --> 22:08.569
- They did the right thing.
- He got away with half the money.

22:08.636 --> 22:11.239
Worth any price to keep missiles
out of terrorist hands.

22:11.305 --> 22:13.875
Let's keep the indictment
against Mannus sealed.

22:13.941 --> 22:16.744
If he doesn't know he's a priority
for us, he'll turn up.

22:16.811 --> 22:19.247
- If he does, we'll get him.
- Yes, ma'am.

22:19.313 --> 22:21.015
Thank you.

22:23.150 --> 22:25.253
By the way, ma'am,
I'm out all day tomorrow.

22:26.053 --> 22:30.024
Warren, you'd tell me
if there was a problem, right?

22:30.091 --> 22:32.960
- Madam President, motorcade's ready.
- Wonderful.

22:33.027 --> 22:34.896
If you'll excuse me.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.198
Ma'am, if it's all right with you,

22:37.265 --> 22:40.001
I have a tremendous amount
of follow-up on the summit...

22:40.067 --> 22:42.737
- Meaning you're not coming.
- I'd rather not, no.

22:42.803 --> 22:45.406
And the real reason for this is?

22:45.473 --> 22:49.410
Look. Frankly, I just don't
want my participation in this

22:49.477 --> 22:52.446
to be perceived in the wrong way.

22:52.513 --> 22:54.415
I can appreciate that.

22:54.482 --> 22:57.852
Not enough to let you off the hook.
Let's go.

23:02.023 --> 23:05.693
[woman] This impromptu town hall
is seen as a daring move,

23:05.760 --> 23:08.696
given the rising tensions in the area.
But a unique move.

23:08.763 --> 23:12.033
No sitting president
has ever visited Hyattsville.

23:12.099 --> 23:16.103
And here she is,
arriving with a small motorcade...

23:16.771 --> 23:19.140
[sirens]

23:22.476 --> 23:25.279
[crowd cheers]

23:43.431 --> 23:47.768
[reporters clamoring]

23:47.835 --> 23:50.471
Madam President, can you say
why you're in Hyattsville.

23:50.538 --> 23:53.474
To meet some people
and try the chops.

24:02.383 --> 24:04.785
I know you've been through
some difficult times

24:04.852 --> 24:08.656
and I want to thank you all
for being here.

24:08.723 --> 24:13.327
I know many of you are on your
lunch hour, so I'll get right to it.

24:13.394 --> 24:17.298
I'd like to thank Chief of Police
Davison for being here,

24:17.365 --> 24:20.267
and for being willing to hear
what you have to say.

24:23.137 --> 24:27.975
As a woman and a mother, I...

24:28.042 --> 24:31.345
I can't imagine the horror
of losing a child.

24:32.880 --> 24:37.952
I want to hear about your experiences
and I want to learn from them.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.788
I also want you to share
any ideas you have

24:40.855 --> 24:44.225
for addressing the crime rate
in your community.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.761
- More cops.
- [man #1] More better cops.

24:46.827 --> 24:51.232
- [man #2] That's what we need.
- [crowd murmuring]

24:51.298 --> 24:54.001
All right, well, let's start there.

24:54.068 --> 24:55.770
Yes, in the blue jacket.

24:55.836 --> 24:58.673
My name is Yolanda.

24:58.739 --> 25:02.109
Five months ago, my daughter...

25:02.176 --> 25:05.880
...she's just six years old.
She got caught in some crossfire.

25:05.946 --> 25:08.683
They're junkies.
Always high on something.

25:08.749 --> 25:12.620
There was a warrant out for this guy
and they never picked him up.

25:12.687 --> 25:15.690
She was a mother of three
and a grandmother of six.

25:15.756 --> 25:19.360
They had no problem coming around
to accuse my son of selling crack.

25:19.427 --> 25:21.228
[crowd murmurs]

25:21.295 --> 25:23.364
But when he got killed in a drive by,

25:23.431 --> 25:26.100
they seemed to have
a much harder time finding the guilty.

25:26.167 --> 25:28.402
[crowd] That's right.

25:30.171 --> 25:33.140
[crowd continues indistinct]

25:39.046 --> 25:42.783
[sirens blaring in the distance]

25:45.219 --> 25:48.055
How does it feel?

25:48.122 --> 25:50.224
To be back.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.994
- A little strange.
- Hmm.

25:55.930 --> 25:58.933
What do they say?
Can't go home again?

26:00.668 --> 26:03.471
When was the last time?

26:04.138 --> 26:05.673
It was William's funeral.

26:07.708 --> 26:10.444
Hell of a b-ball player.

26:10.511 --> 26:13.047
Of course, so were you.

26:18.819 --> 26:21.822
You remember that time we had
to use Terry as our fifth man?

26:23.824 --> 26:26.293
Smacked you in the back
of the head with that pass.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.797
- That was on purpose, I'm sure.
- No doubt, no doubt.

26:29.864 --> 26:33.434
Boy, she had a temper on her.

26:33.501 --> 26:36.403
Pissed her off when you chose
Duke over Howard.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.675
She never said it, but...

26:41.742 --> 26:44.979
...she thought you did good
for yourself.

26:45.045 --> 26:47.715
We all did.

26:47.782 --> 26:50.785
Hey. Thanks for arranging all this.

26:56.524 --> 26:59.160
Gotta pick up the kids.

27:12.339 --> 27:17.344
Last year, Prince George's County
reported 135 murders.

27:17.411 --> 27:20.047
One hundred and eight of them
still unsolved.

27:20.114 --> 27:22.817
We've met with the governor,
the chief of police.

27:22.883 --> 27:26.020
Clearly, nothing is going to happen
any time soon.

27:26.086 --> 27:30.391
Talk to me about the legality of direct
federal intervention in PG County.

27:30.457 --> 27:33.761
Ma'am, I would just caution
that we not overreach here.

27:33.828 --> 27:37.698
Your friend didn't come to ask you to
establish some blue ribbon commission.

27:37.765 --> 27:40.868
Direct federal intervention
in local law enforcement is rare.

27:40.935 --> 27:43.737
It's usually reserved for terrorists,
drug traffickers.

27:43.804 --> 27:48.008
Well, there have been cases of, uh,
federal agents working in concert

27:48.075 --> 27:51.245
with local police to round up
murderers and gang members.

27:51.312 --> 27:53.347
But the results have been mixed,
at best.

27:53.414 --> 27:56.217
Carl, what agencies
are you talking about?

27:56.283 --> 27:58.919
Most of these crimes
involve drugs or guns.

27:58.986 --> 28:02.389
So you'd be talking about the DEA,
the FBI, the ATF.

28:02.456 --> 28:03.991
You send them into PG County,

28:04.058 --> 28:07.061
you're going to be cutting
a pretty wide swath.

28:20.774 --> 28:22.776
Let's do it.

28:22.843 --> 28:25.579
- Afternoon, everybody.
- [reporters] Afternoon, sir.

28:25.646 --> 28:29.783
I've just come from a meeting with
Senate leaders and I am pleased to say

28:29.850 --> 28:33.954
that my Smart Sentencing Act
will pass the Senate with room to spare.

28:34.021 --> 28:35.522
- Mr. Speaker!
- Uh, Connie.

28:35.589 --> 28:38.292
It's been said this bill
is close to your heart.

28:38.359 --> 28:40.060
Can you tell us why?

28:40.127 --> 28:41.762
You know, we live in a world

28:41.829 --> 28:45.165
where each of us, at one time
or another, is touched by crime.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.303
We've just gotten word that President
Allen has sent 40 US Marshals

28:49.370 --> 28:50.838
into PG County, Maryland.

28:50.905 --> 28:52.907
The speaker is here
to answer questions...

28:52.973 --> 28:54.108
Hang-hang on a second.

28:54.174 --> 28:57.511
It's obvious that this
is a political shell game.

28:57.578 --> 29:00.681
Mackenzie Allen
is sending in the cavalry

29:00.748 --> 29:05.519
in a painfully desperate attempt
to tout that she is tough on crime.

29:05.586 --> 29:07.454
But it's not tough,
it's capricious.

29:07.521 --> 29:10.391
- It's a drop in the bucket.
- At least she's doing something.

29:10.457 --> 29:14.161
- You're just talking.
- You don't get it, do you?

29:14.228 --> 29:16.530
She's doing something
to cause a lot of talk.

29:16.597 --> 29:20.668
I'm talking something
to cause a lot to get done.

29:23.137 --> 29:26.106
[man] Response to the federal action
has been varied,

29:26.173 --> 29:29.376
with many beltway politicians
suggesting the president

29:29.443 --> 29:32.379
has ignored states' rights.
Very few...

29:32.446 --> 29:36.083
How can The Wall Street Journal
call me a bleeding-heart liberal

29:36.150 --> 29:40.287
on the same day The National Review
calls me an ultra-conservative?

29:41.121 --> 29:43.190
That's the dilemma of the Independent.

29:43.257 --> 29:46.160
The press only sees black and white
in political spectrum.

29:46.226 --> 29:47.695
Well, here's a keeper.

29:47.761 --> 29:51.632
The bloggers are calling us
fascists in jackboots.

29:51.699 --> 29:54.134
I always wondered
how I'd look in a pair of those.

29:54.201 --> 29:57.738
[man] Not surprisingly,
the most vocal critic of the president

29:57.805 --> 30:01.875
- is Governor Stan Preston of Maryland.
- Now what?

30:01.942 --> 30:04.278
She can try to hide
behind political platforms,

30:04.345 --> 30:05.679
but the truth of the matter is

30:05.746 --> 30:09.984
that the president is micro-managing
the situation in Prince George's County,

30:10.050 --> 30:14.054
not because she has any great desire
to reform crime legislation,

30:14.121 --> 30:16.657
but because her chief of staff
is from Hyattsville.

30:16.724 --> 30:20.027
[woman] Are you saying the president
is doing him a personal favor?

30:20.094 --> 30:22.229
Well, I don't see any
federal troops in LA

30:22.296 --> 30:25.332
- or Detroit or Chicago. Do you?
- Excuse me.

30:25.399 --> 30:27.468
[reporters clamoring] Governor!

30:29.970 --> 30:33.007
- [woman] ...is to influence Congress.
- [TV clicks off]

30:34.742 --> 30:37.811
I just ran into Senator Quint's
chief of staff.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.647
I'm sure our colleagues
from Maryland

30:40.714 --> 30:42.783
are none too pleased
with what she's doing.

30:42.850 --> 30:44.885
They're not,
but their constituents are.

30:44.952 --> 30:48.122
Both senator's offices
have been flooded with phone calls

30:48.188 --> 30:49.523
in favor of the actions.

30:49.590 --> 30:52.326
It's knee-jerk. It'll pass.

30:52.393 --> 30:55.596
Not in time for our vote.
Quint's flipping.

30:56.864 --> 30:58.532
Huh.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.702
Huh. Yeah. Kurlander?

31:01.769 --> 31:03.303
More than likely.

31:04.004 --> 31:06.273
Should we get the Maryland
delegation in here?

31:06.340 --> 31:09.176
No. No. This can't...

31:09.243 --> 31:13.347
[stammering] This bill must pass.

31:13.414 --> 31:16.150
It will pass.

31:16.216 --> 31:20.821
I need to see the vice president.
Right away.

31:20.888 --> 31:23.190
That's very encouraging.

31:23.257 --> 31:26.627
Thank you. And please give my gratitude
to all the agents in the field.

31:26.693 --> 31:28.996
Goodbye. Hey.

31:29.063 --> 31:30.297
- You're back.
- Mm-hmm.

31:30.364 --> 31:32.966
- And you shaved.
- Yep. Got a little itchy.

31:33.033 --> 31:36.136
- Did you have a nice time?
- Yeah. Yeah. It was good for me.

31:36.203 --> 31:38.939
- And Horace?
- He had fun.

31:39.006 --> 31:42.176
- Good.
- I'm gonna go check on Amy and Becca.

31:42.242 --> 31:43.510
OK.

31:44.344 --> 31:45.779
Kelly.

31:46.747 --> 31:49.283
Hey. What's that,
or should I not ask?

31:49.349 --> 31:52.519
Initial results of your actions
in PG County.

31:52.586 --> 31:57.057
82% of those polled in Maryland
support your decision to federalize.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.827
Nationwide? 74.

31:59.893 --> 32:01.895
- Percent?
- Mm-hmm.

32:01.962 --> 32:05.532
Well, at least the public's
not calling me fascistic.

32:05.599 --> 32:08.035
Ma'am, not that you asked, but...

32:08.102 --> 32:10.804
...what you're doing
could really make a difference.

32:10.871 --> 32:14.575
I hope so. I was just on the phone
with the FBI director.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.778
He says they have suspects
in two of the Hyattsville murder cases

32:17.845 --> 32:19.213
and leads on several more.

32:19.279 --> 32:23.117
Vince doesn't call you
"Billy Mac" for nothing.

32:23.183 --> 32:25.486
- Where's he going anyway?
- Ma'am?

32:25.552 --> 32:27.654
He asked for time off,
but he didn't say why.

32:27.721 --> 32:31.792
Uh... Vince had a family event
he needed to attend.

32:31.859 --> 32:36.029
What is it? A funeral?
Wedding? What?

32:37.931 --> 32:39.666
[sighs]

32:40.567 --> 32:42.169
[musical tone]

32:47.474 --> 32:50.043
- What's up?
- Oh, nothing.

32:51.145 --> 32:53.013
- How was your trip?
- Awesome.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.683
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. The best.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.158
[musical tone]

33:09.830 --> 33:12.733
- [footsteps]
- [knocking]

33:12.799 --> 33:14.468
Jim.

33:15.636 --> 33:17.905
I just got a call from the FBI.

33:17.971 --> 33:21.141
They think they may have found
Terry's killer.

33:27.347 --> 33:30.918
Thank you, ma'am. I'm sure
her husband will be relieved.

33:36.924 --> 33:40.227
Ma'am, I'm not proud of the way
I handled things here. I, uh...

33:41.428 --> 33:45.065
Jim, you may be

33:45.132 --> 33:48.602
one of the most principled
individuals I have ever met.

33:48.669 --> 33:51.605
You would never abuse
your access to me, I know that.

33:51.672 --> 33:55.909
And I recognize that its being
perceived that way bothers you.

33:57.711 --> 33:59.846
Tremendously.

34:00.080 --> 34:04.451
But the truth is,
I didn't do it for you.

34:04.518 --> 34:07.754
I did it because it needed to be done.

34:07.821 --> 34:10.924
Well, I appreciate everything
you did for my hometown.

34:12.659 --> 34:16.230
I can't imagine
there are a lot of Republicans

34:16.295 --> 34:18.364
coming out of Hyattsville.

34:18.899 --> 34:21.235
No, ma'am.

34:22.869 --> 34:24.771
So can I ask,

34:24.838 --> 34:26.639
why did you become a Republican?

34:28.242 --> 34:29.576
It was the party of Lincoln.

34:29.643 --> 34:33.880
The party that encouraged black
entrepreneurs to open businesses.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.049
Work hard.

34:38.452 --> 34:40.887
It was a party that, at it's best,

34:40.954 --> 34:43.556
represented everything
my mom taught me

34:43.623 --> 34:45.759
and lived her life by.

34:49.896 --> 34:52.565
- Good night, Jim.
- Good night, ma'am.

34:57.771 --> 35:00.307
[Nathan] Hey, Warren.

35:00.374 --> 35:02.109
- Thank you for stopping by.
- Nathan.

35:02.175 --> 35:05.545
- Have a seat.
- I don't have much time.

35:05.612 --> 35:09.650
You're aware that the speaker's crime
bill is on the floor of the Senate.

35:09.716 --> 35:12.386
It's hard not to be.

35:12.452 --> 35:15.689
- It's going to vote tomorrow.
- And will pass, if memory serves.

35:15.756 --> 35:18.492
The senators from Maryland
buckled under pressure

35:18.558 --> 35:21.228
and are now supporting
the president's crime efforts.

35:21.295 --> 35:23.597
Right now we're looking
at a 50/50 split,

35:23.664 --> 35:25.732
which as you know, is a loss.

35:25.799 --> 35:29.236
This is an important piece
of legislation, Warren.

35:29.303 --> 35:32.539
Not just for me, but for the nation.

35:32.606 --> 35:36.109
I know that you would support
this bill's goals and intentions.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.045
I know this because
you've supported

35:38.111 --> 35:40.814
similar sentencing guidelines
in the past.

35:40.881 --> 35:42.015
You're your own man.

35:42.082 --> 35:44.985
A fact that's well known,
well-respected.

35:45.052 --> 35:48.088
And you're constitutionally empowered

35:48.155 --> 35:49.389
to break this tie.

35:49.456 --> 35:52.326
You expect me to go to the Senate

35:52.392 --> 35:56.396
and stand up before the world
and vote against my commander in chief?

35:56.463 --> 35:57.964
Yes.

35:58.031 --> 36:02.536
Because you're of a generation
that values honor,

36:02.602 --> 36:05.872
because you love
the American people.

36:05.939 --> 36:07.374
And because,

36:08.041 --> 36:10.844
if you recall,

36:11.545 --> 36:13.113
we made a deal.

36:18.418 --> 36:19.553
[Mac] Pam.

36:19.619 --> 36:21.988
Will you veto the Templeton Act
if it passes?

36:22.055 --> 36:24.591
Looks like I won't have to.
It's tied in the Senate.

36:24.658 --> 36:27.260
- Thank you, everyone.
- [reporters clamoring]

36:28.362 --> 36:29.896
Here we go.

36:29.963 --> 36:31.932
Mr. Keaton is in the building.

36:31.998 --> 36:36.703
[woman] ...to cast that deciding vote
on the Templeton bill.

36:36.770 --> 36:40.307
[Warren] On this vote,
the yeas are 50

36:40.374 --> 36:42.709
and the nays are 50.

36:42.776 --> 36:46.813
Thanks. Times, Trib, and Post,
they're all leading with Safe Cities

36:46.880 --> 36:47.981
above the fold.

36:49.082 --> 36:51.818
- What's this?
- Vote on the Templeton Act.

36:51.885 --> 36:54.554
- [Warren] The Senate...
- OK, so why is Warren there?

36:54.621 --> 36:57.224
...being equally divided...

36:57.290 --> 36:59.192
The only reason he would be
is to vote yes.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.728
And why would my vice president
do that?

37:01.795 --> 37:03.697
Maybe because Templeton
asked him to.

37:03.764 --> 37:06.199
He was in the speaker's office
last night.

37:06.266 --> 37:11.505
[woman] ...will cast the deciding vote
on the 50-50 split on the bill.

37:11.571 --> 37:13.840
Come on, come on.

37:13.907 --> 37:16.676
[woman] And it looks as if
he's ready to speak.

37:16.743 --> 37:19.246
Vice President Keaton.

37:19.312 --> 37:22.282
The Vice President votes...

37:23.717 --> 37:25.752
...in the negative.

37:25.819 --> 37:28.455
The nays have it.

37:28.522 --> 37:30.991
- The bill fails.
- [gavel pounds]

37:31.057 --> 37:32.959
[woman] The Templeton bill has failed.

37:33.026 --> 37:35.328
What the hell was that about?

37:35.395 --> 37:38.231
Whatever the reason for his appearance,
the act is a failure.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.834
- Wouldn't have thought it a week ago.
- He lost ground.

37:40.901 --> 37:43.770
- Church-going moms under 45.
- And we gained.

37:44.438 --> 37:46.540
Without trying.[chuckles]

37:46.606 --> 37:49.075
Dickie, hang back, will you?

37:49.342 --> 37:53.180
- There a problem?
- Yeah. A pretty big one, actually.

37:53.246 --> 37:57.217
A few weeks ago, I asked for,
and received, a commitment from you.

37:57.284 --> 38:00.954
- I believe I've honored it, ma'am.
- See, that's where I beg to differ.

38:01.021 --> 38:06.359
You convinced my personal assistant,
no, a very dear friend,

38:06.426 --> 38:09.963
to keep something clearly
very important to him from me.

38:10.030 --> 38:13.500
In all fairness, Vince was leaning
toward not telling you already.

38:13.567 --> 38:16.303
I just gave him a nudge
in the right direction.

38:16.369 --> 38:20.140
- You politicized a personal situation.
- With all due respect...

38:20.207 --> 38:23.610
Mr. McDonald, consider this strike two.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.754
Let's see if we can move up
the cabinet meeting as well.

38:34.821 --> 38:37.958
I want a working lunch with
the attorney general on the task force.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.627
Yes, ma'am.
Anything else, ma'am?

38:40.694 --> 38:44.431
Yes. Uh, I wonder if you could
answer a question for me.

38:44.498 --> 38:46.099
Sure.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.802
Were you being protective?

38:48.869 --> 38:51.037
Or were you just afraid to invite me?

38:51.104 --> 38:54.441
I wasn't afraid exactly,
I just didn't...

38:54.508 --> 38:57.777
Oh, it doesn't matter.
It's done.

38:57.844 --> 39:00.580
It'd be nice to meet him sometime.

39:03.884 --> 39:07.621
- [man] Madam President.
- Warren?

39:07.687 --> 39:11.691
Ma'am, I apologize for arriving
without advanced notice.

39:11.758 --> 39:15.662
Not a problem.
Nice work on the floor today.

39:15.729 --> 39:18.899
Odd protocol, but thank you.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.234
- Uh, may I?
- Please. Sit.

39:31.978 --> 39:34.781
Ma'am, my wife has been ill.

39:34.848 --> 39:38.985
- I'm so sorry.
- Actually, she's, uh...

39:41.021 --> 39:42.856
...she's dying.

39:42.923 --> 39:46.560
Oh, my God. Warren.

39:46.626 --> 39:51.565
She's been diagnosed
with stage 4 ovarian cancer.

39:51.631 --> 39:55.936
And uh, it's been quite a shock to us,
as you can imagine.

39:56.002 --> 39:58.672
It... it all happened so quickly.

40:01.541 --> 40:04.844
Do they know? The doctors...

40:04.911 --> 40:06.580
How much time she has?

40:06.646 --> 40:10.750
[exhales] Three months.
Six months.

40:10.817 --> 40:12.819
Maybe a year.

40:12.886 --> 40:15.889
But, regardless...

40:15.956 --> 40:19.025
- ...I want to be with her.
- Of course.

40:19.092 --> 40:23.396
So...

40:23.463 --> 40:28.935
[exhales deeply] This is hard.

40:30.470 --> 40:35.141
I respectively request that you
accept my immediate resignation

40:35.208 --> 40:37.644
as your vice president.

40:37.711 --> 40:40.847
I am so sorry, ma'am.

40:42.649 --> 40:46.653
You will be a tremendous loss
to this administration.

40:46.720 --> 40:49.723
But I understand completely.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.764
You know, every day,

40:57.831 --> 41:01.735
your every move
is put under the microscope

41:01.801 --> 41:05.138
because you are the first
female president.

41:06.740 --> 41:10.377
And not one of those
people that judge you

41:10.443 --> 41:14.347
has ever spoken
of your compassion.

41:14.414 --> 41:19.753
Not as a president.
Not as a friend.

41:19.819 --> 41:23.723
- It's truly remarkable.
- Thank you.

41:26.126 --> 41:28.328
My wife is a very proud woman.

41:28.395 --> 41:31.031
I will see to it
that your privacy's respected.

41:31.097 --> 41:33.033
I know that's a lot to ask

41:33.099 --> 41:35.268
'cause if I leave
without an explanation,

41:35.335 --> 41:36.603
they'll fault you.

41:38.304 --> 41:40.073
You will be missed.

41:40.140 --> 41:44.077
It's been an honor and a privilege
to serve you, Madam President.

41:44.144 --> 41:45.412
Thank you, Warren.

41:52.152 --> 41:55.055
Mr. Gardner.

41:55.121 --> 41:58.191
- Goodbye.
- Sir.

42:01.961 --> 42:04.698
Ma'am, everything all right?

42:04.764 --> 42:06.700
Let's talk about it later.

42:06.766 --> 42:08.902
This someone you want me to meet?

42:08.968 --> 42:10.737
Yes, ma'am.

42:11.538 --> 42:15.642
Madam President, I would like to
introduce you to my old friend,

42:15.709 --> 42:19.479
Louis Highsmith. Bobo.

42:19.546 --> 42:22.682
- Pleasure to meet you, Bobo.
- It's an honor, ma'am.

42:22.749 --> 42:25.518
- A real honor.
- Thank you. Thank you.

42:25.585 --> 42:27.854
[indistinct chatter]
