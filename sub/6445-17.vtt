00:16.558 --> 00:22.303
Fight fans. Are you ready?

00:24.441 --> 00:28.855
Tonight's epic brawl
is a special co-ed matchup.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.771
Introducing two new....

00:50.801 --> 00:55.295
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome....

01:16.326 --> 01:18.863
You're paid to keep an eye
on the ﬁghts...

01:19.496 --> 01:21.111
...not me.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.826
The view in here is a lot better.

01:25.335 --> 01:29.669
Security guard by day,
Catholic schoolgirl by night.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.922
You're a woman
of many talents, Athena.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.583
And a woman of many desires.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.844
Unfortunately, none of them are you.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.600
Taking off early?

01:41.393 --> 01:43.850
Rough day. How's the ﬁght going?

01:44.021 --> 01:45.136
It'll all be over soon.

01:45.647 --> 01:49.105
The big guyjust showed up. He's an animal.
Where'd Maddox ﬁnd him?

01:49.276 --> 01:52.609
Outside a bar in Omaha.
Busting up a group of Hell's Angels.

01:55.199 --> 01:59.989
Next time I catch you peeping at me,
I'll put you in a cage with him.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.708
What's going on here?

02:12.883 --> 02:14.874
He's tearing up the place.
He killed Maddox.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.792
-Who?
-Titan.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.010
Time to die, Kryptonian.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.820
Thanks, Oliver.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.577
Yeah, I'll call you if I ﬁnd anything. Bye.

04:07.748 --> 04:11.912
"Police are bafﬂed over a recent string
of bizarre citizen's arrests.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.997
Numerous career criminals
have been mysteriously delivered...

04:15.172 --> 04:19.256
...to stations throughout the metro area,
in most cases unconscious."

04:19.426 --> 04:21.838
Clark, do you know anything about this?

04:22.763 --> 04:26.096
It sounds like some bad guys
have ﬁnally been brought to justice.

04:26.266 --> 04:30.350
Well, some of them were hurt pretty badly.
That sounds like a little more than justice.

04:31.146 --> 04:34.104
They were meteor infected.
Put up a ﬁght.

04:35.943 --> 04:39.026
I know you're trying to help,
but you can't go about it this way.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.606
It's not right.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.524
You know what's not right, Mom?

04:42.699 --> 04:45.691
It's doing nothing when I could be out there
making a difference.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.827
Now, I gotta go. Oliver gave me a tip.
I gotta follow up on it.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.533
Clark.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.250
I know how difﬁcult
Lex and Lana's wedding was for you.

04:55.420 --> 04:59.208
But ever since that day,
it's like you've become another person.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.710
Why?

05:01.885 --> 05:04.217
Because I'm not distracted
by my feelings for Lana?

05:04.388 --> 05:06.879
That I can ﬁnally focus
on what I need to do?

05:07.057 --> 05:10.891
Sweetheart, you should never consider
what you felt to be a distraction.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.017
Love is a natural human emotion.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.889
Maybe my mistake
was having those feelings at all.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.525
I'm not human, Mom.
It's time I stopped pretending to be.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.951
Clark, can you believe this?

05:38.130 --> 05:41.839
A krypto ﬁght club on the Internet?
How come nobody else knows about this?

05:42.009 --> 05:44.421
According to Oliver,
getting the link and password...

05:44.594 --> 05:46.721
...oosts more than most people
make in a year.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.953
Yeah, ﬁght fans.

06:17.127 --> 06:21.871
The choice is yours. Live or die.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.961
Vote now.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.425
The choice is yours.

06:28.263 --> 06:31.096
Vote now.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.974
Die.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.322
Clark, he just killed that guy.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.151
Chloe, I need you to trace the link
back to the source.

06:54.331 --> 06:58.324
I'm trying, but they're bouncing it off
about a billion different proxy servers.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.790
Whoever's running this operation
made sure no one would ﬁnd them.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.545
Didn't Oliver and your super pals
give you anything else?

07:04.716 --> 07:06.672
It was a short conversation, Chloe.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.549
They're kind of busy lately.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.087
All he said was he thought
the location was somewhere nearby.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.517
The security on this stream
is off the charts.

07:14.684 --> 07:18.142
I mean, I can't record it,
I can't download it, I can't....

07:18.688 --> 07:21.350
Yeah, ﬁght fans.

07:21.525 --> 07:26.440
Your winner
and still undisputed champion.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.980
The one, the only...

07:30.158 --> 07:33.616
Titan.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.831
Freeze that frame.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.878
What is that?

07:47.717 --> 07:49.378
Is that Kryptonian?

07:53.682 --> 07:54.842
It's a prison tattoo.

07:56.059 --> 07:59.222
Chloe, Titan isn't meteor infected.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.729
He's from the Phantom Zone.

08:18.874 --> 08:21.741
I thought we'd end the evening
with a toast.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.372
We've ofﬁcially been married one week.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.375
The baby's safe. It's just sparkling cider.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.427
It's not quite the same
as celebrating on the beach in Phuket...

08:33.597 --> 08:35.087
...but I guess it'll have to do.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.013
Lex, I'm sorry.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.800
I know how much you wanted
to go on this honeymoon...

08:39.978 --> 08:41.263
...but like I said before...

08:41.438 --> 08:46.023
...I don't think that ﬂying off to some
foreign country is good for the baby.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.567
Are you sure that's the only reason
you gave up a week in paradise?

08:56.119 --> 08:59.953
Ever since the wedding, I feel like
you've been pulling away from me.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.409
Everything happened so quickly.

09:02.584 --> 09:07.829
This pregnancy, the wedding,
I still feel like I'm trying to catch up.

09:08.465 --> 09:11.081
I just need a little time.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.471
Take as much time as you need.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.884
We have the rest of our lives together.

09:31.404 --> 09:35.147
Look, I'm sure things will be different
once the baby's born.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.910
Rig ht?

09:38.912 --> 09:40.493
To our new family.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.519
Clark...

10:13.697 --> 10:15.858
...slow down.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.653
I don't have enough money
to hire a full-time maid...

10:18.827 --> 10:21.443
-...to clean up every time you blow in.
-What'd you ﬁnd?

10:21.621 --> 10:25.364
The URL and the password that Oliver
gave you are both null and void...

10:25.542 --> 10:28.705
...which means the ﬁght-club promoters
must be rotating them...

10:28.878 --> 10:30.618
...to maximize security and proﬁts.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.504
-You have nothing?
-Don't bite my head off.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.041
You know I always have something
up my sleeve.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.629
I'm starting to think that super-sleuthing
might be my latent krypto-power.

10:43.977 --> 10:47.936
Okay. So it turns out
that our Billy Idol look-alike...

10:48.106 --> 10:50.722
...is actually a meteor-infected
Belle Reve resident.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.231
Now, this is the weird thing.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.769
After he was killed in that cage,
he was returned back to his padded cell.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.609
The orderlies found his body
this morning.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.195
If we ﬁnd who got him
in and out of the hospital...

11:01.369 --> 11:03.451
...they'll lead us
straight to the ﬁght club.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.361
-And to Titan.
-A|ready on it.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.077
See, your sidekick
isn't completely useless.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.411
Sorry I snapped, Chloe.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.498
I'm worried that Titan might be
a bigger threat than I thought.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.709
Your friend at the Metropolis precinct
helped me ﬁnd these.

11:15.884 --> 11:16.919
It's Titan's victims.

11:17.093 --> 11:21.427
They were found between a crater outside
Omaha, where he landed, and Metropolis.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.427
He left the same wound
on all the bodies.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.435
-And they're all ﬁghters.
-I know why.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.394
The tattoo on Titan's arm.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.773
From what I could tell, it said
he was a warrior, enhanced for combat.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.774
He's been looking for a ﬁght.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.197
What better challenge
for a brawl-loving Zoner...

11:38.365 --> 11:40.822
...than a rumble at a krypto ﬁght club?

11:43.953 --> 11:44.942
Can you believe this?

11:45.121 --> 11:47.908
I couldn't ﬁnd proof of the Chupacabra
in the Everglades.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.789
So now my editor
wants to downsize me.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.120
If I don't come up with an article
in 48 hours...

11:52.295 --> 11:54.377
...I can say adios to my weekly paycheck.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.046
-ls that a story?
-No.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.429
Okay, look, normally,
I would be hands-off...

12:04.599 --> 12:07.090
...but this puppy needs a bone.
Please, coz.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.257
I'll owe you big time.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.644
There's no story for the Inquisitor here,
Lois. It's just a dead end.

12:11.815 --> 12:15.182
After a shower and a cappuccino,
you'll come up with something in no time.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.851
Clark's right. We'll give you some room.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.772
I could have used a little help.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.473
"FR-44."

13:00.613 --> 13:04.197
Fort Ryan, hangar 44.

13:25.722 --> 13:29.340
Hey, puss in boots. Where are you going?

13:32.228 --> 13:34.264
Hey, my car overheated
on the way to work...

13:34.439 --> 13:37.397
...and I just needed some water
for my radiator.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.933
What are you all dressed up for, kitten?

13:40.987 --> 13:43.228
I'm a dancer.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.652
At the Phoenix.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.034
-The strip club down the road?
-Yeah.

13:52.373 --> 13:56.537
Look, I go on-stage in 15 minutes.
I could sure use your help.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.504
This place...

14:01.674 --> 14:03.414
...is a little off the beaten path.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.585
-How'd you even know we were back here?
-My dad's a general.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.879
Before the base
was mothballed and sold off...

14:09.057 --> 14:11.218
...I came here all the time with him.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.381
A general, huh?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.723
I bet he's proud
of how his little girl turned out.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.114
Come on...

14:28.451 --> 14:30.612
...help a girl out.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.288
I'll leave your name at the front door.
You can watch my act.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.868
I do a killer stars and stripes routine.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.467
I've always been a sucker
for a girl in boots.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.390
Lucky me.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.977
Wait right here, kitten. I'll be right back.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.098
You're a very nosy girl, kitty cat.

15:49.032 --> 15:51.523
Pretty nice moves, for a stripper.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.534
Oh, honey, I learned
even better ones as an Army brat.

16:11.012 --> 16:15.346
For your information,
my daddy is proud of me...

16:15.516 --> 16:17.723
...kitty cat.

16:19.437 --> 16:22.304
If you were my little girl,
I'd be proud of you too.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.566
So I think I found
our Vince McMahon wannabe...

16:31.741 --> 16:34.733
...and he has total access
to an endless supply of meteor freaks.

16:34.911 --> 16:39.200
Meet Richter Maddox,
executive administrator at Belle Reve.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.703
How's this guy keeping Titan
locked up in Belle Reve?

16:42.877 --> 16:46.711
Actually, ourjolly mean giant
isn't in the Belle Reve yearbook.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.041
He must be freelancing.

16:48.216 --> 16:52.255
So Maddox isn't just pulling ﬁghters
from the hospital, he's using outside talent?

16:54.263 --> 16:56.845
If I can talk my way into that ring,
I'll ﬁnd Titan.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.099
These bouts are live. You can't risk
showing people your abilities.

17:00.269 --> 17:03.761
-I don't have a choice, Chloe.
-C|ark, he can kill you.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.605
Not if I kill him ﬁrst.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.111
Keep me updated on your progress.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.743
You have full discretion, Bartlett.
Make it happen.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.495
Yes, sir.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.621
Lana?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.122
Lex.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.494
Lana.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.793
Lana.

18:13.676 --> 18:14.791
Oh, my God.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.211
There's something wrong.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.550
Lana.

18:28.191 --> 18:30.432
Somebody help me.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.855
Someone.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.732
Lex.

19:18.741 --> 19:19.901
Lana.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.943
Mrs. Luthor,
you shouldn't get out of bed yet.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.577
You passed out.
You're at Smallville Medical Center.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.240
Where's Dr. Langston?
Is the baby all right?

19:30.002 --> 19:32.414
He didn't return my page
so I called in Dr. Albright.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.586
She's been my family doctor for years.

19:34.757 --> 19:38.249
You're going to be ﬁne, Mrs. Luthor.
You just need to get some rest.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.928
Is the baby all right?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.171
Could you give us a minute?

20:01.617 --> 20:03.357
Lex.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.407
Lana".

20:10.793 --> 20:13.455
...there were complications.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.085
-We lost the baby.
-No.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.423
-Lana, I'm sorry.
-No.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.364
You scared me.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.525
Where did you come from?

21:28.245 --> 21:30.201
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.864
Yeah.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.624
I've had a long day,
so if you're looking to check in...

21:35.795 --> 21:37.535
...the admitting desk is in the lobby.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.876
I'm looking for you, Mr. Maddox.
I wanna ﬁght.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.340
What did I do to you?

21:46.514 --> 21:49.381
No. I mean, I wanna be in your ﬁght club.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.636
You must have me confused
with someone else.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.805
It happens, I have that kind of face.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.233
I know about the ﬁght club.

22:01.404 --> 22:05.147
I know you're not only using patients
from Belle Reve. I want in.

22:07.159 --> 22:11.869
Okay, look, the only place I can get you into
is this psychiatric facility.

22:16.669 --> 22:20.127
You're clearly a very sick person
and you need help.

22:20.381 --> 22:23.293
If treatment's
not what you're looking for...

22:24.135 --> 22:26.000
...then I suggest you back off.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.928
You're barking
at the wrong dog, Jethro.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.686
Now, put your tail
between your legs and get lost.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.234
Not until you let me in that cage.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.803
Yeah.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.929
Now, you're just full of surprises,
aren't you?

23:20.649 --> 23:22.480
You haven't seen anything yet.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.146
No, I bet not.

23:25.321 --> 23:29.781
And I thought with your pretty face,
you'd never gone a round in your life.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.487
But now I can see it in your eyes.

23:33.037 --> 23:35.323
Yeah, there it is.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.784
You've got some ﬁght in you,
don't you?

23:44.131 --> 23:46.247
Welcome to the show.

23:54.683 --> 23:58.096
Yeah. Hey, what do you think
of the name the Man of Steel?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.807
-Man of Steel?
-I give all the ﬁghters their monikers.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.063
Trust me, it's a name
no one's gonna forget.

24:03.234 --> 24:06.021
I got a feeling about these things.
People say I'm psychic.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.935
Remember, play it up for the cameras.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.355
People are forking over top dollar
to see these ﬁghts.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.524
-Where's the crowd?
-We don't have a crowd.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.657
Can't have a crowd
if you want this secret.

24:14.829 --> 24:18.196
Besides, who needs an audience
when you got 50,000 watts of sound?

24:18.374 --> 24:21.866
-Check that out. I just bought that.
-Give me a sound check.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.040
Now, here's how it works.

24:26.215 --> 24:29.958
We sell the spectacle
to the "high rollers" online, and the noise...

24:30.136 --> 24:32.627
...pumps up the ﬁghters just ﬁne.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.384
-Where's Titan?
-Titan?

24:37.059 --> 24:40.222
That's the main event. I wanna
warm you up with something easy ﬁrst.

24:40.396 --> 24:44.184
Won't be much of a ﬁght, but it doesn't
matter, because all the fans wanna see...

24:44.358 --> 24:45.894
...is someone die.

24:46.068 --> 24:48.059
Then who am I ﬁghting?

24:49.738 --> 24:53.697
Get off me. I hope you like the taste of
vinyl, honey, because you're about to eat...

24:53.868 --> 24:56.405
-...a ﬁstful of red patent leather.
-Lois?

25:02.084 --> 25:03.164
Smallville?

25:13.888 --> 25:15.298
Stand by on one.

25:15.472 --> 25:18.259
We're online in...

25:18.434 --> 25:20.516
...three, two...

25:20.686 --> 25:22.142
...one.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.020
Yeah, ﬁght fans.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.938
Are you ready?

25:33.115 --> 25:37.358
Tonight's undercard
is a special co-ed matchup.

25:37.536 --> 25:41.449
Introducing two new combatants.

25:41.624 --> 25:45.617
In this corner, the voluptuous...

25:45.794 --> 25:48.285
...the vicious...

25:48.464 --> 25:51.126
...Vixen!

26:01.143 --> 26:04.135
Yummy.

26:04.313 --> 26:10.809
And, now, entering our arena
for the very ﬁrst time.

26:10.986 --> 26:15.150
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

26:15.324 --> 26:17.315
...the all-powerful...

26:17.493 --> 26:19.654
...the all-American...

26:19.828 --> 26:25.824
...Man of Steel!

26:33.801 --> 26:36.008
I can't wait.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.502
Ladies.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.509
Good luck, pretty boy.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.188
Lois, what are you doing here?

26:49.984 --> 26:52.521
Trying to stay alive.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.435
-Punch me.
-What?

26:54.613 --> 26:57.776
Look, not too hard,
just enough to make it look real.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.362
All they want is a ﬁght.

27:00.869 --> 27:03.861
As soon as I hit the mat,
Maddox will come back in...

27:04.373 --> 27:07.865
-...and we make our getaway.
-l'm not gonna punch you, Lois.

27:10.713 --> 27:13.705
Fine. Then you take the dive.

27:15.551 --> 27:19.294
That isn't just a six-pack under your shirt,
that's a steel kegger.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.352
Kal-El.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.238
Wait. Wait.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.028
The live feed went down.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.879
The show is over.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.592
Lois, run.

28:21.450 --> 28:22.439
What's going on?

28:22.618 --> 28:24.609
He's tearing up the place.
He killed Maddox.

28:24.787 --> 28:26.448
-Who?
-Titan.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.250
Leave her alone.

28:42.304 --> 28:46.138
The human means nothing to me.
You're the ﬁght I've been hoping for.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.351
You don't belong here.

28:48.519 --> 28:50.430
You're the one that doesn't belong.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.456
Time to die, Kryptonian.

30:25.616 --> 30:27.732
My turn.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.319
Good ﬁght.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.685
Sorry to bother you.
This must be a difﬁcult time.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.643
-Get to the point.
-We located the ﬁght club as instructed.

32:23.817 --> 32:26.183
-So you have Titan?
-Negative.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.526
He was dead when the team arrived.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.024
According to your reports,
Titan decimated...

32:33.201 --> 32:35.863
...some of the toughest
meteor freaks out there.

32:36.038 --> 32:38.871
-Now, who could've taken him down?
-We don't know, sir.

32:39.041 --> 32:42.374
We lost our Internet link
right before the team moved in.

32:42.544 --> 32:46.036
They did retrieve Titan's body.
You'll ﬁnd the autopsy report interesting.

32:54.890 --> 32:58.974
-He wasn't a meteor freak.
-No, sir.

32:59.519 --> 33:00.895
Titan wasn't human.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.084
How's Lois?

33:27.255 --> 33:30.463
She's pretty banged up, but the doctor says
she's gonna be all right.

33:30.634 --> 33:34.172
She's already started working
on her article about the ﬁght club.

33:35.764 --> 33:39.598
Don't worry, she didn't see me do anything
newsworthy. I won't be making headlines.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.434
I'm glad to know she's ﬁne.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.516
How are you doing?

33:47.984 --> 33:52.068
I thought that Titan was the last prisoner
I let escape from the Phantom Zone...

33:53.699 --> 33:55.781
...but looking at all these....

33:57.202 --> 34:00.444
If there are any more out there,
I'm sure you'll ﬁnd them.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.201
And then what?

34:04.960 --> 34:08.418
I don't know how to return them
to the Phantom Zone.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.379
The only way to get rid of them...

34:11.633 --> 34:13.339
...is to kill them like I did Titan.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.125
Clark...

34:15.721 --> 34:17.837
...from what you told me,
that was an accident.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.801
-That's what I keep telling myself.
-Well, what if it wasn't?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.637
He would have killed you.

34:22.811 --> 34:25.473
Oh, so I just killed him ﬁrst?

34:25.814 --> 34:28.601
How does that make me
any different than Titan?

34:28.775 --> 34:32.518
What you're feeling right now
is what makes you different.

34:32.696 --> 34:33.776
Regret, remorse...

34:33.947 --> 34:37.485
...for a creature who would've murdered
you and Lois without a second thought.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.159
Those feelings
are what make you human.

34:41.329 --> 34:44.162
No matter how much you deny it.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.491
And what about the anger?

34:48.211 --> 34:50.827
I wanted to kill him, Mom.

34:51.298 --> 34:54.415
I wanted to kill him
with my bare hands.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.503
I've never felt rage like that before.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.347
You were angry
before you ever heard of Titan.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.008
We both know
that's not what this is about.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.568
How could Lana do it?

35:16.656 --> 35:19.193
How could she marry Lex?

35:19.367 --> 35:22.029
I don't know, Clark,
but she made her choice.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.239
Or someone made it for her.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.623
I have to ﬁgure out what happened.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.413
Honey...

35:34.883 --> 35:37.590
...I understand how much this hurts.

35:37.761 --> 35:42.755
But part of being human,
of being in love...

35:43.850 --> 35:46.387
...is learning to let go.

35:47.729 --> 35:51.142
If you can't, I'm afraid the anger
you're feeling will always be there.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.883
Nell called.

36:20.262 --> 36:22.924
She wanted to know
if you'd like some company tomorrow.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.757
I don't know.

36:30.105 --> 36:34.269
Lana, you haven't left this room
since we got back from the hospital.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.278
I like it here.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.687
I called Dr. Langston...

36:40.866 --> 36:43.357
...to tell him what happened.

36:43.994 --> 36:47.361
They told me he was killed
in a car accident.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.706
My God.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.544
That's terrible. When?

36:58.300 --> 37:01.042
The day of our wedding.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.973
Lex, why is all this happening?

37:09.811 --> 37:12.644
Some things in life are just...

37:12.814 --> 37:15.100
...out of your control.

37:16.818 --> 37:21.653
Sometimes you have to let go
and leave it in the hands of a greater power.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.200
I lost our baby.

37:29.998 --> 37:32.580
I'm so sorry.

37:35.712 --> 37:37.828
Hey.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.960
It wasn't your fault.

37:43.470 --> 37:46.007
I have to know for sure.

37:47.182 --> 37:50.640
I need to get my ﬁles
from Dr. Langston's ofﬁce.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.852
We will.

37:59.653 --> 38:01.985
Lana, how can I make—?

38:03.031 --> 38:06.023
How can I help make
the pain go away?

38:07.327 --> 38:09.568
What can I do?

38:47.993 --> 38:50.735
Are you sure these are
all of her ﬁles?

38:51.746 --> 38:53.702
Thank you for your help, Dr. Albright.

38:53.873 --> 38:57.036
Now, forget you ever heard
of Lana Luthor.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.822
