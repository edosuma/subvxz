00:09.400 --> 00:09.618
.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.099
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:12.142 --> 00:13.665
sexually based offenses

00:13.709 --> 00:15.450
are considered
especially heinous.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.495
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:17.539 --> 00:19.323
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:19.367 --> 00:21.021
are members of an elite squad

00:21.064 --> 00:22.718
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:22.761 --> 00:25.460
These are their stories.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.679
- Sam Conway, 15.

00:27.723 --> 00:30.030
His gym coach saw blood on
the back side of his shorts.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.075
- He claims he fell.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.685
- So we're looking
at sexual assault.

00:33.729 --> 00:36.036
- Yeah, the exam indicated
anal penetration.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.341
- Give me names here.
Who was he?

00:38.734 --> 00:41.432
I needed this to happen.

00:41.476 --> 00:44.609
See if anybody knows anything?
- The mother knows.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.134
- I heard sounds
from Sam's room.

00:47.177 --> 00:49.353
My husband was standing
over the bed.

00:49.397 --> 00:52.052
It looked like he was
fastening his belt.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.142
- Mr. Conway, turn around.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.708
You're under arrest.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.101
- The rape of your son.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.277
- Sometimes my mom, she just--

01:00.321 --> 01:01.365
she doesn't know
what she's saying.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.500
- No, no, that's ridiculous.

01:05.543 --> 01:08.546
- We find the defendant
not guilty.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.290
- Juries can be unpredictable.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.249
I'm not making excuses.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.512
Yeah. I understand, sir.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.558
- The D.A. just asked
the same thing.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.343
Not as politely.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.214
- The family stuck together.
That's a tough nut to crack.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.477
- Yeah. I should have used
a bigger hammer.

01:26.521 --> 01:27.826
- Mr. Conway, do you feel
validated by the verdict?

01:27.870 --> 01:29.785
- I'm glad the jury
saw the truth.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.134
- What's next for
your family?

01:31.178 --> 01:32.657
- I just want to get
everyone home,

01:32.701 --> 01:34.659
safe, resume our
normal lives.

01:34.703 --> 01:37.445
- Well, I think the most
important thing...

01:37.488 --> 01:39.142
- Molly.
- Is this family

01:39.186 --> 01:40.752
to get back to
normal, so...

01:40.796 --> 01:41.797
Excuse us.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.581
- If you ever
wanna talk--

01:43.625 --> 01:45.279
- Thank you,
but I'm fine.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.282
Tell your father I need
to use the ladies'.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.501
I'll meet you at the car.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.416
- Sam...

01:56.942 --> 01:58.422
- I know what you're going
to say,

01:58.466 --> 02:00.120
and you're wasting
your time--

02:00.163 --> 02:01.686
- You don't have to go
home with your husband.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.210
- And you said it anyway.
- We can open a case

02:03.253 --> 02:05.429
with Child Protective
Services.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.824
- Get Sam out of the
house, protect him.

02:08.867 --> 02:11.131
That's been your
instinct.

02:11.174 --> 02:13.437
- The best way I can
keep Sam safe

02:13.481 --> 02:14.699
is to stay with him.

02:14.743 --> 02:18.268
You can't watch
him 24/7.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.748
- John knows he
crossed a line--

02:21.228 --> 02:22.881
Molly,
he raped your son.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.405
- And a jury found
him not guilty.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.189
Maybe I didn't see what
I thought I saw.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.669
- Oh--Stop, stop, stop.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.540
- All John ever wanted
was to keep us safe.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.368
Me, Brian, Sam.

02:32.848 --> 02:35.720
You believe him over what
you know? As a mother--

02:35.764 --> 02:37.592
- I have to!
I am choosing to!

02:37.635 --> 02:40.334
Because, the alternative--
court hearings,

02:40.377 --> 02:42.901
legal and emotional battles
for months, years--

02:42.945 --> 02:44.207
that doesn't sound like
what's best

02:44.251 --> 02:45.556
for Sam, or my family.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.167
- Promise me,
at the very least--

02:47.210 --> 02:49.952
at the very least,
you'll get Sam counseling.

02:49.995 --> 02:54.652
And for Brian, and for
yourself, Molly.

02:54.696 --> 02:57.699
- We don't need your
help.

02:59.918 --> 03:02.791
we don't ever need to
speak again. Excuse me.

03:11.669 --> 03:12.670
Sam!

03:14.281 --> 03:15.978
- It's 6:30, honey.
It's time to get up.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.896
You don't have to go
to school today

03:20.939 --> 03:22.332
if you don't want to.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.248
- I want to...and
Dad said that I--

03:25.292 --> 03:27.337
- Oh...oh.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.731
You sure you're not
coming down with something?

03:29.774 --> 03:31.994
You're a little warm.

03:32.037 --> 03:35.258
- Yeah, maybe so.

03:42.483 --> 03:46.791
You know what? Um...
I think I feel fine.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.710
I want to go to school.

03:54.669 --> 03:57.280
- So, you got baseball
practice today.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.890
- Riverside Park.

03:58.934 --> 04:01.850
Bus leaves at 3:15, should
be back to school by 6.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.505
- How about I pick
you boys up after?

04:04.548 --> 04:05.897
We can go to Shake Shack.

04:05.941 --> 04:09.031
- Molly, they're
teenagers, not toddlers.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.773
- We can take the subway.
Right, Sam?

04:11.816 --> 04:13.731
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.690

Now listen; all right,
he's not at your house.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.548
He's not at your
father's work.

08:38.213 --> 08:39.736

to school.

Why don't you go ahead?

10:54.915 --> 10:58.309
Kill yourself, take
responsibility for your actions.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.007

in custody?

12:04.811 --> 12:07.552
- Yes, with his mother, waiting
for the father and a lawyer.

12:07.596 --> 12:10.207
- Good. I don't want any
statements thrown out later.

12:10.251 --> 12:14.298
- The weapon was a Remington
.22 semi-automatic rifle.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.474
CSU found
six bullets at the scene.

12:16.518 --> 12:19.521
- Plus the seven victims, this
gun holds at least 15 rounds.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.218
He only fired 13 times?

12:21.262 --> 12:23.177
- He's a lousy shot.
It could have been worse.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.656
- Well, it was bad enough.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.442
- He was also carrying
a Smith & Wesson 9C.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.836
Never fired.
Both guns are legal

12:29.879 --> 12:31.446
and registered to
the father.

12:31.489 --> 12:32.795
- And the mother swears
that both guns

12:32.839 --> 12:34.231
were in a locked safe.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.363
- Well, even if that's true,
the kid

12:35.406 --> 12:36.625
figured out the
combination.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.235
All right, what about
the victims?

12:38.279 --> 12:39.802
Were they targeted?
- Not that we know of.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.804
The only one that he
had a specific relationship

12:41.848 --> 12:43.501
was Gillian Wray.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.503
- It's not about that.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.418
- Witnesses say he
wasn't aiming at anyone,

12:47.462 --> 12:48.680
just firing at random.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.596
- Bringing a hunting
rifle to school--

12:51.640 --> 12:53.642
This is about the father.

12:53.685 --> 12:54.817
- Excuse me.
Excuse me!

12:54.861 --> 12:56.471
I need to see my son.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.820
- Mr. Conway.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.691
- I wanna see my son.
Where is he?

12:59.735 --> 13:01.519
What are you doing
here, Stone?

13:01.563 --> 13:03.521
Can't wait to lock
Sam up too?

13:03.565 --> 13:04.914
- We will be arraigning him.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.786
Whether he is remanded
is up to the Judge--

13:06.829 --> 13:08.309
- Your wife and your son
are in interrogation one.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.527
This way.

13:09.571 --> 13:10.746
- Anything he said without
the presence

13:10.790 --> 13:12.226
of his lawyer
is inadmissible.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.575
- He already confessed.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.882
Plus, we have dozens
of eye-witnesses.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.624
- Sam's lawyer is here.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.975
- Let's go, Sam.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.715
- I want to go
with him.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.413
- I'm sorry, that's not
possible, Mrs. Conway.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.372
- Please. Please, please.
- Dad, I'm so sorry--

13:28.416 --> 13:30.505
What did you do?

13:30.548 --> 13:32.724
You son of a bitch!
This is your fault!

13:32.768 --> 13:34.683
Putting sick ideas
in my boy's head!

13:34.726 --> 13:38.600
- Please escort Mr. Conway
out of my squad room. Now!

13:41.690 --> 13:47.870
♪

13:47.914 --> 13:50.351
- Reactions to the
tragedy on social media

13:50.394 --> 13:53.528
have been overwhelming--
outpourings of support

13:53.571 --> 13:55.747
for the two victims
who lost their lives,

13:55.791 --> 13:59.926
16-year-old Heather Lewis
and 17-year-old Justin Cruz.

14:04.974 --> 14:07.847
- Carmen and I go way
back.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.893
- I'd fire her if she wasn't
the best assistant I ever had.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.635
- People screaming
and just running

14:13.678 --> 14:16.464
and just panic everywhere.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.772
- Somebody has to.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.949
- You heard people screaming.
I was--

14:22.992 --> 14:25.821
- I might actually have
to take this kid to trial.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.389
He pleaded not guilty.

14:28.432 --> 14:29.956
- I heard.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.784
Remanded to
Horizon Juvenile.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.439
- Suicide watch.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.659
You see, their lawyer
will get a shrink,

14:37.702 --> 14:39.443
and then we--we will
get a shrink also.

14:39.487 --> 14:40.836
And then, round and round
we'll go.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.707
Ring around the goddamn
rosie--

14:42.751 --> 14:44.579
- Peter, this is not
your fault.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.755
- I made the decision
to cross-examine him.

14:46.798 --> 14:50.019
I could have stood up, and said,
"No questions, Your Honor."

14:52.021 --> 14:54.545
I could have looked in
that boy's eyes

14:54.589 --> 14:58.680
and seen how fragile
he was, and damaged.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.856
I should have seen past
the brave face,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.858
thought about sparing
his soul any more pain,

15:02.902 --> 15:04.294
instead of winning my case--

15:04.338 --> 15:08.951
- Peter. You were trying
to save him.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.040
- I didn't have to
cross-examine him.

15:11.084 --> 15:15.784
- Yes, you did. His father
raped him, for God sakes.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.351
- And then I raped him

15:17.394 --> 15:19.831
all over again up on
that witness stand.

15:27.448 --> 15:30.538
- You know, aside
from not sleeping.

15:38.546 --> 15:39.982
You worry about your
kid getting sick

15:40.026 --> 15:45.553
or breaking a bone or, God
forbid, getting hit by a taxi.

15:45.596 --> 15:48.773
And then it's like you're...
holding your breath

15:48.817 --> 15:52.690
underwater, every day.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.388
Then you, uh...

15:56.956 --> 16:00.394
You get to tuck them in
and kiss them good night.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.571
You get to breathe
out again.

16:05.921 --> 16:09.707
But this...
this, you can't...

16:09.751 --> 16:11.492
you can't imagine that--

16:11.535 --> 16:15.104
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, it's all right.

16:19.630 --> 16:23.025
Crazy...I'm--

16:23.069 --> 16:24.896
- It's all right,
it's all right.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.768
You can tell me,
it's okay.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.119
- SVU.

16:30.163 --> 16:31.903
You here to see the
State Psych for Sam Conway?

16:31.947 --> 16:33.688
- Uh--yeah.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.912
- Lisa Abernathy.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.872
- Detective Carisi. What
happened to Dr. Olivet?

16:43.915 --> 16:46.744
She's at a wedding in Tuscany.

16:46.788 --> 16:50.444
I'm filling in.
Am I interrupting something?

16:50.487 --> 16:51.575
- No.
- No.

16:51.619 --> 16:55.014
- Good.
Let's talk about Sam.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.888
Do you have any questions
you wanna ask me?

16:59.931 --> 17:03.065
We can start with some
easy ones

17:03.109 --> 17:05.676
like my favorite color
or my favorite song

17:05.720 --> 17:07.722
or my favorite vegetable--
although,

17:07.765 --> 17:09.028
I don't have a favorite
veg--

17:12.118 --> 17:15.947
- Yeah. Because if you...
if you do have kids,

17:15.991 --> 17:17.775
then I know you already
hate me,

17:17.819 --> 17:18.950
so this is a waste
of time.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.778
- I don't hate you,
Sam.

17:22.519 --> 17:26.480
- My wife and I
have a boy and a girl.

17:30.179 --> 17:33.095
- You know, my dad--
he told everyone

17:33.139 --> 17:35.576
that I was gay,
but I'm not.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.100
Do you wanna talk
about him?

17:38.144 --> 17:40.537
- He's a good dad.

17:40.581 --> 17:43.627
- Okay, let's talk about
that.

17:43.671 --> 17:46.021
- He looks out for us.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.633
He's done that ever since
we were little.

17:51.983 --> 17:57.119
- I remember,
I was four maybe...

17:57.163 --> 18:02.124
and I was trying to stick one
of my little soldiers' swords

18:02.168 --> 18:04.866
in the electric socket.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.174
And Dad found out.

18:09.784 --> 18:14.832
He wasn't angry,
but he was serious.

18:14.876 --> 18:18.836
And he told me,
he said...

18:20.751 --> 18:24.842
He said, "This is gonna
hurt me more than you.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.932
But I never want
you to forget."

18:27.976 --> 18:32.154
And then, he told me
to...

18:32.198 --> 18:35.679
pull my shorts down,

18:35.723 --> 18:39.074
and lay on the bed,
and I can...

18:40.162 --> 18:44.166
I can hear his belt

18:44.210 --> 18:46.690
coming off...

18:47.778 --> 18:48.736
Son of a--

18:48.779 --> 18:50.694
- It's okay.

18:51.913 --> 18:54.002
- And he hit me.

18:55.308 --> 18:59.834
And it hurt so bad,
you know?

18:59.877 --> 19:01.662
And I was crying.

19:03.838 --> 19:08.103
But I never forgot.
I never forgot.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.889
And I never tried to
play with that...

19:11.933 --> 19:14.153
electric outlet ever again.

19:16.981 --> 19:20.898
- My clinical evaluation
is Sam is not legally insane.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.118
He wasn't insane during
the time of the shooting.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.207
He knew that firing
the gun was wrong.

19:25.251 --> 19:28.254
He knew the consequences.
He has remorse.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.081
- Two kids are still dead.

19:31.996 --> 19:34.129
- I mean,
in a round-about way.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.913
I mean, this is not
rocket science.

19:35.957 --> 19:38.089
He grew up in a household
with a very traditional

19:38.133 --> 19:41.092
view of masculinity--
taken to the extreme.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.572
Like a toxicity.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.748
- To be a man,
you have to kill animals,

19:44.792 --> 19:46.620
Win ball games,
you don't cry,

19:46.663 --> 19:48.099
you tough out whatever
comes your way.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.754
- Even your own father,
sexually assaulting you.

19:50.798 --> 19:54.105
- Thank you, Doctor.
You'll testify, if need be?

19:54.149 --> 19:57.718
- Yes. But I hope
need won't be.

19:57.761 --> 20:00.242
This boy is on
the verge of a collapse.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.771
- A lot of kids are
assaulted,

20:07.815 --> 20:09.773
abused, and humiliated.
They don't shoot up

20:09.817 --> 20:11.253
schools and murder
other kids.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.776
- I hear you, Detective.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.735
- Mr. Stone,
the Conways are here.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.606
- Thank you.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.913
What can we do
for you?

20:20.828 --> 20:23.613
- We, um...wanted to
tell you in person--

20:23.657 --> 20:26.137
Sam will plead guilty.

20:27.922 --> 20:32.753
- Going to trial would be
a--would be wrong.

20:32.796 --> 20:36.278
For everybody. No more
lawyers, no more excuses.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.976
Whatever you think of me,

20:39.020 --> 20:41.979
I take responsibility
for my son's actions.

20:42.023 --> 20:45.156
- We do.
We both do.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.029
- More importantly,
Sam does.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.031
As a family, we've decided

20:50.074 --> 20:52.120
we can't put anyone
through anymore pain.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.992
You know--the parents,
the students.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.342
- And Sam.

20:56.385 --> 20:57.995
And Brian.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.301
- Okay.

21:00.084 --> 21:01.912
I'll call the D.A.
and the judge.

21:01.956 --> 21:04.350
Sam will have to plead
in open court.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.221
- How long will he
be in prison?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.441
- He'll likely be charged
as an adult.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.225
The time will be substantial.

21:14.403 --> 21:16.449
- Thank you.

21:30.027 --> 21:33.814
- Okay, then. I can let
the victims' families know?

21:33.857 --> 21:35.119
- Yeah.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.952
It's over?

21:43.084 --> 21:45.347
Sam goes to prison,
probably for life.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.741
I get that.
He deserves it.

21:47.784 --> 21:50.265
But the father--

21:50.309 --> 21:52.398
the father
just gets to walk away?

21:52.441 --> 21:56.053
- No. This isn't over.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.012
Not by a long shot.

22:01.407 --> 22:03.322
♪

22:07.195 --> 22:09.458
.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.852
- Hey, Sam.

22:11.895 --> 22:15.290
- Look, I'm pleading guilty.
What more do you want from me?

22:19.555 --> 22:21.383
Just want to hear for
myself

22:21.427 --> 22:22.732
that you're okay with
all this--

22:22.776 --> 22:24.386
firing your lawyer,
and taking a plea--

22:24.430 --> 22:25.605
- I am.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.695
- You're gonna go to
prison, Sam.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.305
And there's a good chance

22:30.349 --> 22:31.698
it'll be for the rest of
your life.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.439
- Well, what do you want
me to do? You want me to

22:33.482 --> 22:35.528
try to get away with it?
Plead not guilty?

22:35.571 --> 22:37.573
- I can't tell you what
I think you should do.

22:37.617 --> 22:38.705
That's not how it works.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.228
- Well, it's my decision.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.751
- No!

22:41.795 --> 22:46.626
So...can you please
leave me alone, now?

22:47.757 --> 22:49.846
- Okay.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.635
- Heather Lewis.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.163
I went to a party
at her house once.

23:03.904 --> 23:06.428
She played Rihanna
like the whole night.

23:10.563 --> 23:14.610
Justin Cruz, um...

23:14.654 --> 23:16.786
I didn't
really know him, but...

23:18.701 --> 23:23.837
Apparently he was like,
a math genius, I guess.

23:29.669 --> 23:32.193
And he had a little sister.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.763
She's only five.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.687
My mom went to the funerals,

23:47.730 --> 23:49.732
and she said no one
even looked at her.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.741
- I'm sorry, Sam.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.832
Don't you know
only pussies apologize?

24:02.876 --> 24:04.399
- No, I didn't know that.
- Look, I didn't even

24:04.443 --> 24:05.835
wanna go to school that day.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.882
All right? I kept saying,
"I'm sorry, but I can't."

24:08.925 --> 24:11.493
And he just said,
"No apologies, no regrets.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.495
That a man looks at the
future, not the past."

24:13.539 --> 24:15.497
- What else did your
dad say, Sam?

24:15.541 --> 24:18.544
- He said, "I don't even
know why I bothered."

24:20.720 --> 24:22.852
- I guess I was
a waste of his time.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.680
Because it didn't work.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.900
- Is that when you put that
rifle in your baseball bag?

24:26.943 --> 24:28.510
We only get

24:28.554 --> 24:29.903
30 minutes a day outside.

24:37.693 --> 24:40.304
Yeah, whatever you need.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.697
Okay, let me know.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.830
Guys, Stone thinks
that there's a way

24:43.873 --> 24:45.875
that he can go after
John Conway.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.407
- I visit Sam every day.
My one hour.

24:56.451 --> 24:59.410
- How's John dealing with
all of this?

25:00.673 --> 25:02.544
- Like he always does,
stiff upper lip.

25:02.588 --> 25:03.980
That's what his father
taught him.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.854
What he tried to teach Sam?

25:07.897 --> 25:09.464
- Molly...

25:11.858 --> 25:15.688
We think your husband
should be prosecuted.

25:15.731 --> 25:18.038
- Didn't you try that
already?

25:18.081 --> 25:20.257
- We believe he should be
prosecuted for the shooting.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.695
- I told you, the guns
were locked up--

25:22.738 --> 25:24.305
- It's not about the guns.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.004
But for creating
an environment

25:28.048 --> 25:31.355
where Sam believed

25:31.399 --> 25:35.272
that shooting
made him a man.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.928
Sam?

25:38.972 --> 25:40.582
Those dead teenagers?

25:42.453 --> 25:45.021
He's 17 years old.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.676
- I can't help anyone anymore!

25:47.720 --> 25:50.853
Not Brian. Not Sam.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.595
This happened because
I went against my husband.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.075
I testified about
what he did to Sam!

25:55.118 --> 25:56.598
If I hadn't done that,

25:56.642 --> 25:59.775
none of this would have--

26:04.737 --> 26:08.610
If just made Sam
stay home from school--

26:08.654 --> 26:10.612
why didn't I keep him
home from school?

26:10.656 --> 26:12.614
Home with me.

26:16.009 --> 26:20.927
All my husband ever wanted
was for his boys to become men!

26:24.974 --> 26:27.411
- My dad is a great father,
and I'll tell you what,

26:27.455 --> 26:31.502
he would never--he was so
messed up about what Sam did.

26:31.546 --> 26:34.549
- Sam shot his classmates
and aimed a gun at you.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.724
Why would he do that?

26:35.768 --> 26:39.554
I don't know!

26:39.598 --> 26:41.643
- Yes, you do. Sam wanted
to prove to your dad

26:41.687 --> 26:43.602
that he could shoot.
- This isn't about that rabbit,

26:43.645 --> 26:46.430
okay, that stupid rabbit--
- No, it's about how your dad

26:46.474 --> 26:48.737
made Sam feel--
ashamed, humiliated--

26:48.781 --> 26:51.392
how he punished your brother.
I know you're not stupid.

26:51.435 --> 26:52.872
I know you know
what was going on.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.743
- Both of us growing up--
me and Sam,

26:54.787 --> 26:56.832
my father treated us
exactly the same,

26:56.876 --> 26:59.139
raised us the same way,
and I never went and--

27:01.794 --> 27:03.491
- Just because you took
it better,

27:03.534 --> 27:05.536
okay, that makes what
your dad did right?

27:05.580 --> 27:08.627
- You're saying
this is my dad's fault?

27:08.670 --> 27:10.629
Then it's my fault, too.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.718
I was there in the woods.
I was there with Sam

27:12.761 --> 27:14.981
right before
he walked into school.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.635
I should have figured it out!

27:16.678 --> 27:17.853
- No, this is not
your fault, Brian.

27:17.897 --> 27:20.029
You're just a kid, okay?

27:20.900 --> 27:22.597
- My life...

27:22.641 --> 27:25.469
my life is over.

27:25.513 --> 27:27.907
My friends are dead,
my mother's a mess,

27:27.950 --> 27:30.953
and my brother's
locked up forever.

27:34.522 --> 27:36.176
This is because of you.

27:36.219 --> 27:39.440
You want someone
to blame

27:39.483 --> 27:42.704
Blame yourselves!
Blame yourselves!

27:49.537 --> 27:51.713
- There's no way that
Molly Conway

27:51.757 --> 27:54.063
is gonna testify against
her husband.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.761
- I can subpoena her.

27:55.804 --> 27:58.720
- And she will lie.
Look, she's had enough, Peter.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.723
And, in my heart of hearts,
I gotta tell ya--I understand.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.421
- He's already lost
his brother.

28:04.465 --> 28:05.771
He doesn't wanna lose
his dad, too.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.424
- We've got the shrink,
the principal,

28:07.468 --> 28:09.557
two of Sam's friends,
none of which make the case.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.037
- And that leaves Sam.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.084
- Who's on suicide watch.

28:15.128 --> 28:18.653
- So much for fighting
the war we can't win.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.046
- The last time
he testified--

28:20.089 --> 28:22.004
- Isn't this time.

28:22.048 --> 28:24.093
Children are dead, Peter.

28:24.137 --> 28:27.009
Two sets of parents
are mourning a dead child.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.619
- And Sam's in prison
for it.

28:28.663 --> 28:30.099
- We already lost Sam,
Peter.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.232
This is about the next
Sam Conway.

28:45.158 --> 28:46.768
- John Conway,

28:46.812 --> 28:48.770
put that gun down
and step away.

28:49.945 --> 28:51.947
- When are you gonna leave
my family alone?

28:51.991 --> 28:53.732
My son's taking a plea.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.125
- We're not here about your
son, we're here for you.

28:56.169 --> 28:58.824
- Put your hands behind you
back--you're under arrest.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.217
- Murder.

29:06.048 --> 29:06.222
.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.485
- You have got to be
kidding me.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.139
My wife's yoga pants
don't stretch this much.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.662
- I'm just following
the statute, Mr. Karey.

29:11.706 --> 29:14.317
My guns were locked up.

29:14.361 --> 29:15.579
- But your son wasn't.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.190
- What the hell is
he talking about?

29:17.233 --> 29:18.582
- Think of it this way,
Mr. Conway:

29:18.626 --> 29:20.628
pit bulls are actually
very good pets.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.673
It's their owners that
turn them into killers.

29:22.717 --> 29:24.284
- You think I made Sam

29:24.327 --> 29:26.242
walk into that school
and start shooting?

29:26.286 --> 29:28.244
- I think that, A,
you failed to perceive

29:28.288 --> 29:30.290
a substantial
and unjustifiable risk

29:30.333 --> 29:32.596
that he would harm others.
And B, such a failure

29:32.640 --> 29:34.947
constitutes a gross deviation
from the standard of care

29:34.990 --> 29:36.470
that a reasonable person
would observe,

29:36.513 --> 29:38.124
under the circumstances.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.516
You put them together,
and what have you got?

29:39.560 --> 29:42.171
C--criminally negligent
homicide.

29:42.215 --> 29:44.608
- Is he saying I didn't
bring my boy up right?

29:44.652 --> 29:46.697
- It's a snowflake defense,
Johnny.

29:46.741 --> 29:48.003
"Daddy made me do it."

29:48.047 --> 29:50.136
Come on.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.313
I thought you were
better than this.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.323
- You know, I heard if you
stare long enough,

30:03.366 --> 30:06.456
a cheesecake will
magically appear.

30:07.501 --> 30:09.285
- How long do I have to
stare for a slice

30:09.329 --> 30:12.158
with strawberry topping
to show up?

30:17.337 --> 30:21.471
- When we sat with Sam Conway,
we talked to him.

30:21.515 --> 30:23.038
We saw where
he was brought up,

30:23.082 --> 30:24.344
how he was brought up.

30:24.387 --> 30:26.041
- Amanda, this is
not our fault.

30:26.085 --> 30:27.956
- I'm just saying,
under Stone's theory--

30:28.000 --> 30:30.785
- Yes, and we did not put guns
in Sam Conway's apartment.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.352
- He could have gotten
a gun anywhere.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.049
He could have used
a knife, a bomb--

30:34.093 --> 30:35.616
- Please don't go all
Second Amendment on me.

30:35.659 --> 30:38.314
- Okay, all right.
I mean...

30:41.665 --> 30:43.363
- No, it's just in Georgia,
you'd be the odd man out.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.974
- Yeah, and that wouldn't
change my opinion.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.410
- Just explain this to me.

30:47.454 --> 30:48.672
Why is Roe v. Wade
sacrosanct

30:48.716 --> 30:50.196
and the Second Amendment
disposable?

30:50.239 --> 30:51.545
- Maybe because one kills.

30:51.588 --> 30:54.156
- In Georgia,
they both do.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.418
You know?

30:55.462 --> 30:57.551
Jesus, what is worse?

31:00.075 --> 31:04.210
I mean, to have your
kid killed, or...

31:06.168 --> 31:08.475
Have your kid be the one
that's killed somebody else.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.043
Mm.

31:16.265 --> 31:19.616
- Amanda, you're...

31:19.660 --> 31:21.314
you're not thinking of--

- I don't know if
I need another baby.

31:29.061 --> 31:31.628
I don't know if I want
another baby.

31:35.589 --> 31:38.809
All I know is,
if I was back home,

31:38.853 --> 31:40.724
the choice would be
a lot easier.

31:40.768 --> 31:43.075
There'd be no choice.

31:44.859 --> 31:46.252
- Give me your phone.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.429
- Just unlock it
and give it to me.

32:09.666 --> 32:14.367
You told me that was
the best moment of your life.

32:17.674 --> 32:20.895
This is your decision
to make...alone,

32:20.939 --> 32:23.419
and I will defend
to the death

32:23.463 --> 32:25.117
your right to make it.

32:26.466 --> 32:29.643
But regret is--

32:32.820 --> 32:34.604
An awful thing
to live with.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.610
You had an abortion?

32:58.324 --> 33:00.674
- I loved my boys the same.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.415
I treated them the same.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.808
- You were tough on
both of them?

33:04.852 --> 33:07.115
- I was firm with them,
when I had to be.

33:07.159 --> 33:09.552
Whatever I did,
it was for their own good.

33:09.596 --> 33:11.902
So they'd be strong.
So the world wouldn't

33:11.946 --> 33:13.556
chew them up

Look, when your son
is born,

You do what you think

who are so tired when
they get home from work,

33:26.874 --> 33:28.919
all they can do is get out
of their suits

33:28.963 --> 33:31.487
and sit in front of
the tube.

33:31.531 --> 33:32.532
Not me.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.708
No matter how tired I was,

33:34.751 --> 33:37.711
I always went to the park,
tossed a ball with my boys.

33:37.754 --> 33:40.279
I went to their games,
whatever.

Yes, I took them fishing

my dad did for me,
that's what I do for them.

I'm still waiting
for someone to tell me

33:47.329 --> 33:50.289
why it's wrong to want your
boys to grow up to be men.

- Thank you.

33:51.899 --> 33:53.335
Thank you.

Good, bad--that doesn't
seem to matter to you.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.525
- Of course I want them
to be good men.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.400
- Both my boys made varsity.

34:15.836 --> 34:18.447

self-confidence.

35:58.199 --> 36:01.071
- He'd say--he'd say I
was a fag or a pussy, okay?

36:04.945 --> 36:06.903
- Like when you couldn't
shoot the rabbit?

36:07.904 --> 36:10.864
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

36:10.907 --> 36:13.475
- So, he wasn't proud
of you then?

36:13.519 --> 36:14.955
- No.

36:16.348 --> 36:19.394
No, he said, "Until further
notice, I was...

36:19.438 --> 36:21.396
a little girl."

36:21.440 --> 36:24.051
Called me "Samantha."

36:25.313 --> 36:27.881
Threw one of my mom's dresses
at me, told me to wear it.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.189
- No.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.235
He said I deserved it, though.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.324
But he would "never hit
a girl."

36:40.372 --> 36:43.375
- Objection! This has
already been litigated.

36:43.418 --> 36:46.508
- Nice try, Mr. Stone.
The objection is sustained.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.427
- In that moment, before you
shot your schoolmates,

36:52.471 --> 36:54.081
what were you thinking?

36:59.173 --> 37:00.479
Would you speak up, Sam?

37:00.522 --> 37:02.220
- "Be a man!"

37:02.263 --> 37:05.135
A voice in my head kept
saying, "Be a man!"

37:05.179 --> 37:07.399
Be a man! Over and over
again. Be a man!

37:11.446 --> 37:15.407
How's that, Dad? I didn't
flinch! Am I a man now?

37:15.450 --> 37:17.757
Huh?

37:21.326 --> 37:28.289
♪

37:33.381 --> 37:35.557
- Did John tell his son
to shoot up the school?

37:35.601 --> 37:37.298
No, he didn't.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.300
Did he put the gun in his hand?
Didn't do that either.

37:39.344 --> 37:42.956
Did he stand by and watch
as Sam pulled the trigger?

37:42.999 --> 37:46.264
Sorry. He was at his office
in another borough.

37:46.307 --> 37:49.092
If we're gonna start making
parents liable

37:49.136 --> 37:51.399
for the independent acts
of their kids,

37:51.443 --> 37:54.968
we better all start losing
weight, because...

37:55.011 --> 37:58.319
there's going to be
a tight squeeze in Attica.

38:06.501 --> 38:10.940
- Men are strong. They're
the hunters, the fighters.

38:10.984 --> 38:14.335
The spear-throwers,
the sword-swingers,

38:14.379 --> 38:16.206
the gunslingers.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.861
They sit in bars
and they toss back shots,

38:18.905 --> 38:21.908
regaling other men with tales
of their sexual conquests.

38:21.951 --> 38:23.518
That's what makes them
masculine,

38:23.562 --> 38:25.912
that's what makes them men.

38:26.869 --> 38:28.349
You get in a fistfight?
That's okay.

38:28.393 --> 38:31.221
It'll make you a man.

38:31.265 --> 38:32.484
You grab a little ass?

38:32.527 --> 38:35.008
Hey, that's what men do.

38:36.618 --> 38:39.578
But what if you cry?

38:39.621 --> 38:42.276
Or show empathy?
Or, God forbid,

38:42.320 --> 38:45.235
you can't shoot
a little rabbit?

38:45.279 --> 38:48.630
Well, I'm sorry, you just
don't deserve to be my son.

38:54.114 --> 38:58.640
The problem is,
Sam is John's son.

38:58.684 --> 39:04.385
The problem is, Sam just
wanted to make John proud.

39:04.429 --> 39:07.519
The problem is,
John wasn't preaching strength.

39:07.562 --> 39:10.435
He was preaching power
over others,

39:10.478 --> 39:12.915
and that's not being a man...

39:14.308 --> 39:16.354
That's being a criminal.

39:25.145 --> 39:26.538
- Have you reached
a verdict?

39:26.581 --> 39:29.323
- We have.

39:30.933 --> 39:32.413
- On the sole count of
the indictment,

39:32.457 --> 39:34.328
Criminally Negligent
Homicide...

39:35.416 --> 39:38.463
we find the defendant,
John Conway, guilty.

39:39.464 --> 39:41.379
- Take the defendant into
custody.

40:13.019 --> 40:14.455
- But I don't wanna go
to bed!

40:14.499 --> 40:16.936
- But you don't have
a vote, mister, okay?

40:16.979 --> 40:18.328
- No!

40:19.504 --> 40:20.679
- Noah!

40:22.028 --> 40:24.247
Don't ever do that again.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.075
- But--
- I don't--

40:26.119 --> 40:28.295
Get in your bed,
right now.

40:32.255 --> 40:34.127
We're gonna talk about
this in the morning.

40:45.791 --> 40:47.488
Good night.

40:48.576 --> 40:50.186
I love you.

40:58.760 --> 41:02.111
Noah, I love you.
