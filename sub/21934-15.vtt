WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.371
Previously on Scorpion...
TOBY: That's Quincy Berkstead.

00:03.404 --> 00:04.472
The man who stole
your fiancÃ©e?

00:04.505 --> 00:07.608
Quincy, really? Nobody wants
to see me in my bikini.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.310
Amy?
That's Amy?

00:09.343 --> 00:10.644
Toby doesn't gamble anymore.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.446
He quit gambling? How?

00:12.480 --> 00:14.382
Well, if he didn't,
I would have walked.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.250
SYLVESTER: The new Chair
of Blades book comes out today,

00:16.284 --> 00:17.585
and I had it delivered here
instead of my apartment.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.320
It took J.
Randall P. Smythe

00:19.353 --> 00:21.589
ten years to write this.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.391
So I saw you talking
to Flo earlier.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.226
You glad I convinced you
to keep her around?

00:25.259 --> 00:26.427
Yes. I have to admit

00:26.460 --> 00:29.797
the reason why I didn't want
her to come was, uh, childish.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.565
What was that?
It's very silly, actually.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.301
I-I dreamt we were married
and we kissed.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.668
What?!

00:37.705 --> 00:40.074
CABE:
Question number one:

00:40.108 --> 00:41.742
Where did you two first meet?

00:41.775 --> 00:44.478
Hup. Please read the
question in the proper form.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.480
Absolutely not doing that.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.516
Come on. The contest is tonight,
and we want to win.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.218
Didn't your football coach say
"Practice like you play"?

00:50.251 --> 00:52.186
No, actually he said,
"If you're complaining

00:52.220 --> 00:53.521
"about how the ball bounces,

00:53.554 --> 00:56.090
you're probably the jackass
who dropped it."

00:56.124 --> 00:57.558
Wonderful tangent.
Game, please?

00:57.591 --> 00:59.593
Fine.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.495
A query,

01:01.529 --> 01:03.397
my dearies:

01:03.431 --> 01:06.834
Where did you first meet
your deary?

01:06.867 --> 01:08.102
BOTH:
Nemo's Diner.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.637
Next question.
Bring it on.

01:09.670 --> 01:13.407
A query, my dearies:

01:13.441 --> 01:16.777
What was the first foreign
country you traveled to

01:16.810 --> 01:17.778
with your deary?

01:17.811 --> 01:19.147
BOTH:
Bosnia.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.581
(both laugh)
We must be like butter

01:20.614 --> 01:22.150
'cause we're on a roll.

01:22.183 --> 01:26.854
A query, my dearies:

01:26.887 --> 01:29.757
Where did you first kiss
your deary?

01:29.790 --> 01:30.858
At Kovelsky's.
In the garage.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.193
Huh?

01:32.226 --> 01:33.294
(buzzer sounds)

01:33.327 --> 01:35.363
Wrong.
TOBY:
Uh-oh.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.431
That's the sound
of a couple that is about

01:37.465 --> 01:38.799
to lose their desks.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.701
PAIGE: Our first kiss
was in Kovelsky's

01:40.734 --> 01:42.136
coat closet.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.571
Actually, my deary,
our first kiss came

01:43.604 --> 01:44.838
at your desk,
when we were testing

01:44.872 --> 01:47.875
to see if we had any attraction
to each other.

01:47.908 --> 01:50.278
That wasn't romantic, it was an
experiment. It doesn't count.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.613
Did our lips press against each
other in a passionate encounter?

01:52.646 --> 01:54.882
That's a kiss.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.617
HAPPY:
Engine block will fit nicely.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.818
You're not taking our desks.

01:57.851 --> 01:58.719
TOBY:
We had a deal.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.554
After we beat
your tuchases in this game,

02:00.588 --> 02:01.855
Happy and I get your desks.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.224
Asinine.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.892
TOBY:
No, it's scientific.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.427
I'm trying to fertilize my wife.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.495
Gross.
Gross.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.697
And studies prove
that couples that see each other

02:09.730 --> 02:11.732
more often have
a higher rate of success

02:11.765 --> 02:14.435
when the tadpole train pulls
into the ovulation station.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.637
You can see her
from your desk.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.439
No, no, no. I want to be
right across from her.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.374
I want Happy to get pregnant
as much as anyone,

02:20.408 --> 02:21.875
but I am office manager.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.744
My desk needs to be
centrally located,

02:23.777 --> 02:25.779
not over by
all that greasy stuff.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.848
Yeah, and I think it's stupid,
so we'll win the game,

02:27.881 --> 02:29.350
you two will owe us
dinner at Kovelsky's,

02:29.383 --> 02:30.884
and we will retain
our work stations.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.887
CABE: Don't be
so sure, my dearies.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.289
You're both wrong.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.324
Huh?
Your first kiss

02:36.357 --> 02:38.492
was when Paige kissed Walt

02:38.526 --> 02:40.394
when he was out cold
in the hospital.

02:40.428 --> 02:41.795
HAPPY: Pretty sure
that's a crime.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.964
Oh, what's really a crime
is that these guys

02:43.997 --> 02:45.466
have to practice
to beat us.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.303
Don't take our
no-look high five.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.672
We've been no-look high-fiving
way before you two.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.241
This is going nowhere fast.
We need to get

02:53.274 --> 02:54.074
to the airport
and catch our flight.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.943
Yeah, Paige is right.
Okay, Happy,

02:55.976 --> 02:58.212
quick brush up: What did you
find about the schematics?

02:58.246 --> 03:00.381
Power plant's actually
well designed.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.983
According to
the diagnostic reports,

03:03.016 --> 03:07.755
last week's quake resulted
only in moderate cracking

03:07.788 --> 03:08.956
in the core's walls,

03:08.989 --> 03:10.324
all through here.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.660
Should only take
a few hours to repair.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.961
I spoke with the Mexican
Power Authority this morning.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.062
They approved our use
of our sonar technology

03:15.095 --> 03:18.732
to precisely pinpoint all
fissures and seal them.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.700
WALTER: Great.
Government gig,

03:19.733 --> 03:22.370
helping an ally, good payday.
Let's pack.

03:23.871 --> 03:24.672
(quietly):
Paige.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.841
(Paige sighs)

03:29.577 --> 03:31.445
What do you want?
I'm not giving you my desk.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.713
It's not about that.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.283
You know I'm an enthusiastic
lover, right?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.950
And?

03:36.984 --> 03:38.819
With all
the procreation recreation,

03:38.852 --> 03:41.289
I slipped a disc
in my lower back.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.024
We are all way too involved
in each other's lives.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.794
Be that as it may, Coach Quinn
isn't gonna put me on the bench,

03:46.827 --> 03:48.929
so I need to heal up
before the next big game.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.499
Since you're the office manager,
you think you can

03:51.532 --> 03:52.866
manage to get me off duty?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.001
Okay, fine.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.403
Walter?

03:55.436 --> 03:57.771
Any way Toby can
pass on today's mission?

03:57.805 --> 03:58.872
His back hurts.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.274
From what?

04:00.308 --> 04:01.375
Enthusiasm.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.912
Fine.
Yeah, I don't want to know.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.314
And where is Sly?

04:06.347 --> 04:07.715
He's supposed to be here
running tests

04:07.748 --> 04:09.016
on the reactor's performance.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.217
He knows we have to leave soon.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.421
He's probably preparing software
on the bus ride back here.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.426
I have to say, out of
all the costumes here,

04:18.459 --> 04:20.428
ours are the
most authentic.

04:20.461 --> 04:23.431
I don't want to be that guy,
but I saw a Klentorian warrior

04:23.464 --> 04:25.999
walking around with a pewter
amulet instead of brass.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.869
How do you expect to meet a girl
when you make a gaffe like that?

04:28.902 --> 04:29.737
Indeed.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.772
(phone ringing)

04:33.807 --> 04:34.975
Paige. What's up?

04:35.008 --> 04:36.577
Sky, we're leaving
for Mexico shortly.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.446
Great Falcon's feathers,
it's already Wednesday.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.680
You have a genius IQ.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.449
I know you know
how to use a calendar.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.451
I'm sorry. I've been waiting
on line for J. Randall P. Smythe

04:43.484 --> 04:45.052
outside The Warlock's Chest
since yesterday.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.387
I lost track of time.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.322
Chair of Blades author?

04:48.356 --> 04:51.024
Are you in your smock?
I bet you're in your smock.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.960
It's called a
tunic, and yes.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.663
Paige, the thing is, J. Randall
P. Smythe only gives a window

04:55.696 --> 04:57.531
for when he'll show
for a book adornment.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.533
And sometimes, he doesn't
even show at all.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.834
Sounds like a tool.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.470
If I leave, I
might miss him.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.505
You hanging out with that dork
you're always with?

05:05.806 --> 05:07.040
No, just me.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.709
Dyfrost.

05:08.742 --> 05:09.843
CABE: Hey, why don't
we let Sly wait there

05:09.877 --> 05:12.045
during our flight down,
and see if the author shows up.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.515
And if he doesn't, then
Dyfrost can take his books

05:14.548 --> 05:15.849
and get them signed.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.718
All the books.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.623
You gave Sly a book
to get signed, didn't you?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.992
Clam it.

05:25.025 --> 05:28.396
Fine, Sly, but you need to be
back here at work when we land.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.563
Is that clear?

05:29.597 --> 05:32.733
Absolutely. Bye.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.869
I get it. My mom's only
letting me stay till 4:00.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.571
Women, right?

05:39.573 --> 05:40.941
Okay, we're off.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.943
Toby, hold down the fort.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.712
Feel better, Doc.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.947
Tell Sly to call us
when he gets here.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.081
HAPPY:
Rest up.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.817
Tonight, you are
back on the job.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.852
Huh. How romantic.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.801
All right, hurry up.
They're gone.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.002
Coast is clear?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.904
Yeah. I thought they'd
never leave. Come on in.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.040
I hate having to sneak
around like this. I'm sorry.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.108
Well, it's not like you
and Happy are long-lost chums.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.077
And, look, we're-we're trying
to preggo her eggo.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.413
Any undue stress could
make that more difficult,

06:19.447 --> 06:21.482
so it's best she not know.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.816
I understand.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.017
Uh, okay, so, look,

06:24.051 --> 06:26.787
you were a little emotional
and rambling on your voice mail.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.456
So why don't you
just lay out

06:28.489 --> 06:29.423
exactly what's going on
with Quincy.

06:29.457 --> 06:32.125
And I hate to be a jerk,
but can you talk fast?

06:32.159 --> 06:33.193
Running around
with my ex-fiancÃ©e

06:33.226 --> 06:34.662
won't make Happy too happy,

06:34.695 --> 06:36.564
so I'd like to get
this over with ASAP.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.766
Yeah, okay, um, you know,
so like I said,

06:38.799 --> 06:40.701
whenever everything went down
in the bunker,

06:40.734 --> 06:44.672
I decided to end things with
him, and he took it very poorly.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.139
You know,
the-the bunker business died,

06:46.173 --> 06:47.374
there was bad press,

06:47.407 --> 06:50.210
his speaking engagements dried
up, no more TV appearances.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.879
So I-I went
to the bank

06:51.912 --> 06:53.447
to find my accounts drained.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.582
My credit was ruined.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.784
I mean, he-he stole my driver's
license, my passport,

06:56.817 --> 06:58.151
my Social Security
card, everything.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.820
And with no way
to prove your identity,

06:59.853 --> 07:01.522
there's no way to prove
your identity's stolen.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.691
That's a classic
21st century dilemma.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.125
I can't believe
that he did this.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.927
I mean, he is
a very desperate man.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.128
With an even more
desperate beard.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.129
Anyway, I-I figured

07:09.162 --> 07:10.731
he was hard up for money,

07:10.764 --> 07:13.567
and so he sold my identity
for a couple of bucks.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.969
Amy, your identity is worth
more than a couple bucks.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.971
You're a felony-free citizen
with solid credit.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.007
Quincy made a nice chunk
of change there.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.809
See, this is why I came to you.

07:21.842 --> 07:25.145
You know all of
the down and dirty stuff.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.981
And I-I don't, I don't
mean to insult you,

07:28.015 --> 07:29.817
it's just, you know,
when we were together,

07:29.850 --> 07:32.786
you knew every lowlife,
loan shark

07:32.820 --> 07:34.655
or backroom card hustler.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.824
That was your world.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.826
No offense taken.
I was a dirtbag.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.728
I'm gonna make
a few calls.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.195
There's some people
I think might have intel

07:42.229 --> 07:43.330
on stolen paper in L.A.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.933
And they move their Koreatown
setup every few months.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.035
Hey.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.202
Thank you.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.138
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.707
That's, um... It's no problem.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.645
Amy, when we were together,
I put you through the wringer,

07:57.678 --> 08:00.213
stealing all your savings
for my long shots and underdogs.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.516
So if someone else
is doing this to you,

08:02.550 --> 08:03.517
that's the least I can do.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.090
So I've found, as my Fantasies
'N Frolics scores ascend,

08:10.123 --> 08:10.958
so does my career.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.826
The same week I went
from a level five

08:12.860 --> 08:14.562
to a level six player,

08:14.595 --> 08:17.898
I went from assistant manager to
co-manager at the Pic 'N Save.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.166
I'm only at level two.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.001
But audiology takes up
most of my time.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.937
I see.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.207
Hey. You're supposed
to be my wingman.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.777
I'm trying to impress
this pretty stereo salesperson.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.244
She doesn't
sell stereos.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.246
She's a doctor.
This is why I need a wingman.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.720
By Elvin Hooves.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.027
Take my books.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.730
I don't feel that well.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.967
We've had success with
this sonar equipment

08:54.001 --> 08:55.135
in the past, Maria.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.970
We'll be able to
locate the most

08:57.004 --> 08:59.206
microscopic cracks
in the reactor core.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.107
PAIGE: Which we'll seal
with a special compound

09:00.140 --> 09:02.576
Happy Quinn designed
just for this job.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.845
It's quick-drying, waterproof,
stress-resilient.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.114
Your reactor will be
at full power in no time.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.115
MARIA:
We can't thank you enough.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.684
This community was once
a dying fishing village.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.053
This plant brought jobs, enough
energy so we could expand.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.624
Our population has grown
to almost 10,000 residents.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.326
And most of them rely on this
plant to feed their families.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.796
Since we've been shut down,
people are hurting.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.598
Well, Scorpion is happy to help.

09:24.632 --> 09:28.235
Speaking of helping,
I am at the garage now,

09:28.268 --> 09:30.671
setting everything up
as we speak.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.139
CABE:
Hey, Sly.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.774
You take care of business?

09:33.807 --> 09:34.975
I have a man on it.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.610
Is that man wearing

09:36.644 --> 09:38.145
a blue dress with stars on it?

09:38.178 --> 09:41.148
Get off my back. You'll get
your dumb autograph, okay?

09:41.181 --> 09:43.951
You okay, Sly?
You seem stressed.

09:43.984 --> 09:44.985
I'm not stressed.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.353
Well, you sound bothered.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.088
I'm not bothered, either.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.323
Except by this third degree
I'm getting.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.325
All right, well, Sly, why don't
you just give us the readings?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.694
Scanning them now.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.162
All the cracks are up.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.931
The visible ones should be
easy enough for you to spot.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.801
The sonar is picking up
on the microfissures now.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.703
Be careful.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.304
Slow and steady.
(quiet rumbling)

10:04.337 --> 10:07.207
If you want it slow and steady,
hold it slow and steady.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.375
I am holding
it steady.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.342
You're shaking it.
(rumbling grows louder)

10:09.376 --> 10:10.711
No, I'm not doing anything.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.680
This sucker is shaking
on its own.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.181
Oh, man. Hold on!
(alarm blaring)

10:14.214 --> 10:15.348
Is this another quake?

10:15.382 --> 10:18.118
Technically, but...

10:18.151 --> 10:21.354
it doesn't seem to be more
than a light aftershock.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.956
It's already over.
(rumbling stops)

10:22.990 --> 10:25.258
WALTER:
Sly, what are the details?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.360
I know it may have felt like
a light aftershock,

10:27.394 --> 10:29.697
but it was actually part
of the seismic waves

10:29.730 --> 10:31.899
from a 9.1 earthquake

10:31.932 --> 10:34.902
that hit in the Pacific
72 miles off the coast!

10:34.935 --> 10:36.904
Oh, no.
What is it?

10:36.937 --> 10:38.171
MARIA:
Our tsunami warning system.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.273
There was a huge surge
off the Pacific.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.010
Fuente Roja is 12 feet
below sea level.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.145
This is bad.
SYLVESTER: It gets worse.

10:45.178 --> 10:48.148
NOAA estimates
38 minutes until landfall.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.719
And based on the reported size
of the surge,

10:51.752 --> 10:54.421
there's a 100-foot wave
headed your way!

11:08.468 --> 11:09.837
We need to get
the hell out of here.

11:09.870 --> 11:10.704
We can't till we seal
those cracks.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.072
Now, if the tsunami
floods this reactor

11:12.105 --> 11:13.741
with those cracks
still exposed,

11:13.774 --> 11:15.475
it will melt down
just like Fukushima.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.978
There's no way we can seal
all these cracks in 38 minutes

11:18.011 --> 11:20.247
and still get out of here alive!

11:20.280 --> 11:23.150
We can if we construct
a pulley system.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.052
I can Spider-Woman around here.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.954
It'll slash the time
needed to do the job.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.155
Okay, do it.
Paige, go help them

11:28.188 --> 11:29.356
find what they need
for the build.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.357
Copy that.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.759
Where's the exterior
exhaust vent?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.093
On the south wall. Why?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.094
WALTER:
We need to plug it.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.163
Now, if the ocean water
from the tsunami seeps

11:36.196 --> 11:37.898
into the core
through that vent...

11:37.931 --> 11:39.466
Also Fukushima.
Exactly.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.101
I'll alert the authorities
to begin an evacuation plan,

11:41.134 --> 11:42.903
and I'll have a helicopter
pick your team up from the roof

11:42.936 --> 11:44.271
once you're finished.
Great.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.139
Uh, Paige, once you're done
helping Cabe and Happy,

11:46.173 --> 11:47.374
meet me outside the south wall.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.242
Got it! Toby!
(alarm wailing)

11:49.276 --> 11:51.011
Any advice for Maria
on the best way

11:51.044 --> 11:52.846
to evacuate a town of 10,000?

11:52.880 --> 11:54.014
SYLVESTER:
Uh...

11:54.047 --> 11:55.816
Toby's not here.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.985
What do you mean he's not there?
Where the hell is he?

11:58.018 --> 11:59.887
Um...

11:59.920 --> 12:01.922
Running errands?

12:01.955 --> 12:03.490
TOBY: Look, there's only
a handful of people that deal

12:03.523 --> 12:05.492
in that kind of paper,
so our best bet

12:05.525 --> 12:06.526
is to start with
Rhonda Duffy.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.928
How do you know her?

12:07.961 --> 12:09.930
Uh, played in her card game
back in the day.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.431
Rhonda's, uh, a real pistol.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.867
And she carries one, too,
so tread carefully.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.070
Are you sure we're
gonna be safe?

12:17.104 --> 12:18.438
Yeah, yeah. We'll be fine.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.774
Rhonda loves me.

12:20.808 --> 12:25.112
You conniving, scheming,
backstabbing, little creep.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.413
How was your Christmas?

12:26.446 --> 12:28.782
I knew you'd come
out eventually

12:28.816 --> 12:30.217
from whatever rock
you been hiding under,

12:30.250 --> 12:32.385
you hat-wearing turd.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.787
I'm not a turd, Rhonda.

12:33.821 --> 12:36.957
If you sat in a sandbox,
my cat'd bury you.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.091
Now, you owe me

12:38.125 --> 12:41.461
$8,213.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.496
So where is it?

12:43.530 --> 12:46.033
Or do I have Lugo
take your ear?

12:46.066 --> 12:49.569
Well, for one thing, my entire
body isn't worth eight grand.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.570
And two,

12:50.603 --> 12:53.140
we both know you like
to keep your books clean.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.541
So I'm gonna bet

12:54.574 --> 12:56.810
that you sold my debt
to some knuckle-dragger

12:56.844 --> 12:58.946
for 40 cents on the dollar.
Am I right?

13:00.848 --> 13:03.150
Yeah. My bill with you
is square.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.551
So, Rhonda,
I need a little favor.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.586
(laughs):
You got to be kidding.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.188
No, no, no, no.
I'm dead serious.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.490
You see, this woman right here
is a civilian, and...

13:10.523 --> 13:11.859
Hi. Dr. Amy Berkstead.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.493
She doesn't care.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.329
See, Amy, she got
her identity stolen.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.398
And I figured,
classy lady like you

13:18.431 --> 13:20.400
would know
who might trade

13:20.433 --> 13:22.002
in that kind of paper.
Tell you what.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.571
You walk out of here right now,
I won't have my guys

13:24.604 --> 13:27.240
beat you dizzy in front
of your little friend.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.610
All right. Have it your way.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.512
It was lovely to see you.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.882
You know, it's a shame,
'cause if I go,

13:34.915 --> 13:36.316
I'm not gonna be able
to tell you

13:36.349 --> 13:38.485
how you're getting robbed blind
down there.
Bull.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.855
You see the rack in front of
that guy right there?

13:41.889 --> 13:43.523
Now, I'm gonna assume

13:43.556 --> 13:45.625
that this gentleman's been
coming to your establishment

13:45.658 --> 13:47.560
for, eh, couple weeks now.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.530
He hasn't won yet.
He loses two or three grand.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.565
And then all of the sudden,
today, bam!

13:52.599 --> 13:54.567
Oh, boy, is he incredibly lucky.

13:54.601 --> 13:58.071
Looks like he's up, uh,
what is that, 20 large or so?

13:58.105 --> 13:59.973
Wow.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.143
Rhonda, this man set you up
like a bowling pin.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.012
AMY:
Come on.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.880
She doesn't want your help,
and I don't have time

14:06.914 --> 14:08.882
for this nonsense, okay?
You heard the lady.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.951
Hold it.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.186
You catch me a cheat,

14:13.220 --> 14:15.322
I'll tell you who has
Mrs. Doctor's identity.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.290
Deal.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.458
Cabe, you sure
you can handle this?

14:18.491 --> 14:20.327
I'm gonna be 115 pounds

14:20.360 --> 14:22.329
of swinging spider monkey
in there.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.596
CABE:
I won't let you fall, kid.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.266
Sly, where do I
need to be?

14:26.299 --> 14:28.368
SYLVESTER:
The first crack cluster

14:28.401 --> 14:30.670
is 12 feet down
at exactly 45 degrees.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.172
HAPPY:
Done and done.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.440
Hold on tight, Pops.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.474
Whoa!

14:36.109 --> 14:37.644
CABE:
It's okay. All right.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.279
Happy, you all right?

14:39.312 --> 14:40.613
I'm on. Ready to patch.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.615
Sly!

14:42.649 --> 14:44.184
I'm at the exhaust vent.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.619
We need to figure out a way
to plug this thing.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.221
SYLVESTER: Sand is
an aggregate in concrete.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.223
Can that work?
Possibly.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.659
But we need to add something
to create a slurry.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.061
Oh.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.530
Aha! Oil.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.066
Yeah, that'll cause
a coagulation.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.968
But if it's gonna
hold the water out,

15:01.001 --> 15:02.502
we'll need a thickening agent.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.138
Seaweed! Seaweed is used
as a thickener

15:05.172 --> 15:06.273
in nail polish.
WALTER: Brilliant.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.276
Seaweed has carrageenans
known for gelling properties.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.144
Now, I'm gonna mix sand
into the oil.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.446
When you get here, gather
as much seaweed as you can.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.383
HAPPY: The sealant is
activated by high heat.

15:16.416 --> 15:20.020
After I apply it to the cracks,
I'll use my torch to harden it.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.261
Okay. Last group
of micro cracks,

15:28.295 --> 15:30.330
11 o'clock,
six feet from the rim.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.065
HAPPY:
Got it!

15:33.733 --> 15:35.602
Sly, is Toby back yet?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.670
No. He's still busy.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.440
HAPPY: Doing what? We're dealing
with a tsunami here.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.309
I'm not sure.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.611
You're lying.
I can hear it in your voice.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.613
Like when I caught you
ordering that poster

15:46.646 --> 15:48.248
with all the girl superheroes
on it,

15:48.281 --> 15:50.117
and you said it was
for your cousin.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.284
Okay, okay.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.253
I saw Toby and Amy
in a car together,

15:53.286 --> 15:54.754
and I don't know
where they were headed.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.090
Amy?

15:57.124 --> 15:59.092
As in ex-fiancÃ©e Amy?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.527
What's he doing with her?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.662
HAPPY: Sly, you better find out
what he's up to.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.697
Don't make me spy on my friend.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.699
HAPPY:
I'm gonna make my foot spy on

16:06.733 --> 16:08.701
the inside of your butt
if you don't.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.004
That's a nice line.
I'm gonna use that.

16:11.038 --> 16:14.541
Okay, I'm searching. Uh...

16:14.574 --> 16:17.244
New England Journal of Medicine
articles.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.047
A coupon for Spam.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.251
What's at 452 San Marino
in Koreatown?

16:24.284 --> 16:26.419
He's taking her to Koreatown?

16:26.453 --> 16:29.356
MAN: That's it.
(players chattering)

16:29.389 --> 16:30.690
SHOOTER:
I want to make some money!

16:30.723 --> 16:33.726
You want to make some money?!
Yes!

16:33.760 --> 16:37.030
Come on! There you go!

16:37.064 --> 16:38.531
There it is, right there.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.700
Here we go.
You ready?

16:40.733 --> 16:42.269
Yeah, yeah.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.803
That was a great bluff
with Rhonda, by the way.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.238
She really bought that
you were leaving.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.740
Well, I learned bluffing
from the best.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.349
You okay?

16:56.383 --> 16:58.785
Yeah, yeah. Just saying hi
to an old friend.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.454
Hello, gambling.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.391
CROUPIER:
Place your bets.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.692
Oh, looky here.
All right!

17:05.725 --> 17:08.061
Looks like we got a hot table.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.497
Why don't you give me, um...

17:10.530 --> 17:12.265
Give me $100 on every hard-way.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.200
Money plays.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.068
Smart man, riding my bet.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.036
I'm on fire!
Yeah, looks that way, boss.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.479
(crowd cheering)

17:26.513 --> 17:28.548
CROUPIER: Hard six!
Attafella!

17:28.581 --> 17:29.782
Yeah!

17:29.816 --> 17:31.584
Press it.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.853
Press my bet.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.422
Let me see you do that again.

17:35.455 --> 17:39.292
Buddy, I've been
doing it all night.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.128
(laughs)

17:42.462 --> 17:43.430
(crowd cheering)

17:43.463 --> 17:44.431
Boom!
Boom!

17:44.464 --> 17:45.665
Winner, winner!

17:45.698 --> 17:47.134
Kovelsky dinner!

17:47.167 --> 17:48.868
This feels good.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.804
(ringtone, Happy's voice):
Attaboy. Attaboy.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.606
Attaboy.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.542
Sorry, honey, not right now.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.244
SHOOTER:
You know what?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.578
Double my bet.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.114
I got a horseshoe up my butt;
I'm so lucky.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.682
Technically, what's helping you
isn't what's up your butt.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.417
It's what's
on your neck.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.754
SHOOTER:
What the hell?

18:07.787 --> 18:10.257
Hey, Lugo, this gentleman's
got a little bit of

18:10.290 --> 18:11.624
clear resin on the
back of his neck.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.193
You see, just a dab will do you

18:13.226 --> 18:14.527
if you're looking
to weigh the dice

18:14.561 --> 18:17.430
for snake eyes or
boxcars or really

18:17.464 --> 18:18.498
whatever roll you want.
SHOOTER: No, no, no, no!

18:18.531 --> 18:19.499
Wait. No, wait.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.134
Wait. Ah!

18:22.635 --> 18:25.138
Spotted that 'cause I ran
the same exact scam

18:25.172 --> 18:26.473
on a riverboat casino.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.807
Oh, I recall.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.277
That was the night of
our engagement party.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.844
You missed it.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.214
We should talk to Rhonda.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.715
Okay.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.351
WALTER: Paige, spread it
evenly so it dries faster.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.786
We won't get a
second shot at this.

18:39.819 --> 18:40.853
Right, like our first kiss.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.556
Huh?
I can't believe
you consider the garage kiss

18:43.590 --> 18:44.924
our real first kiss
and the kiss at Kovelsky's

18:44.957 --> 18:46.726
our second crack at it.
Thing is,

18:46.759 --> 18:48.161
when there are two events,

18:48.195 --> 18:49.362
I consider the one
that happened first

18:49.396 --> 18:51.864
the first event, and then
the second one the second event.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.466
I'm weird like that.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.468
The Kovelsky's kiss
was right after you said

18:55.502 --> 18:58.205
you were in love with me, which
makes it our first real kiss.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.173
Well, not without
a time machine.
You suck.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.107
Just cover the holes.
It's covered.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.875
Okay, great! Happy,
where do you stand?

19:02.909 --> 19:05.645
Right now,
I am pretty anti-Toby.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.948
No! Where do you stand on
patching the reactor core?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.883
Oh. I'm done.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.286
Not a moment too soon.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.387
The helicopter's
on the roof,

19:14.421 --> 19:16.589
but pilot has to take a
longer route to the airport.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.557
Why the change?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.326
Tremors toppled over
the Fuente Roja bridge.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.893
He needs to maneuver
around the ash cloud

19:20.927 --> 19:22.495
that was created
by the collapse.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.496
SYLVESTER:
That bridge

19:23.530 --> 19:24.964
is the only way out of town.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.466
How will the residents evacuate?

19:26.499 --> 19:27.667
They won't.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.669
We'll have to try
to find higher ground.

19:29.702 --> 19:30.803
HAPPY:
We're below sea level.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.606
There's no way to get
10,000 people to safety in time.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.508
MARIA: Authorities are
doing the best they can.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.844
Please. I need to get back
to my family and you need to go.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.579
There is no more
that you can do here.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.913
CABE: We can't just
leave these people

19:40.947 --> 19:42.949
here to die.
Walt, any ideas?

19:42.982 --> 19:45.285
Yes. We're gonna
have to stop it.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.320
Stop what?
Please don't say the tsunami.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.588
Please don't say
the tsunami.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.623
Guys, we're gonna
have to stop the tsunami.

19:55.995 --> 19:56.996
A query, my deary,
but how the hell

19:57.029 --> 19:58.531
are we supposed
to stop a tsunami!?

19:58.565 --> 19:59.832
I read a paper by Dr. Kadri

19:59.866 --> 20:00.833
at Cardiff University
School of Mathematics

20:00.867 --> 20:04.237
that theorized that you could
stop a tsunami

20:04.271 --> 20:06.406
by creating acoustical
gravitational waves

20:06.439 --> 20:08.975
triggered by an
underwater avalanche.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.944
The sound waves would reduce
the amplitude of a tsunami

20:11.978 --> 20:14.847
and redistribute its energy
across a larger space.

20:14.881 --> 20:18.351
So we could save the town,
and thousands of lives.

20:18.385 --> 20:21.554
Walter, I'm the one who
showed you Dr. Kadri's paper.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.791
And it clearly states that
his thesis is only theoretical.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.260
Tell you what isn't theoretical
is the death and destruction

20:27.294 --> 20:29.296
that's gonna hit this town
in 20 minutes.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.963
Walt, can we pull this off?

20:30.997 --> 20:32.732
We have everything
that we need right here.

20:32.765 --> 20:33.833
Sly, pull up
the oceanographic map

20:33.866 --> 20:35.502
of Fuente Roja.
I have a plan.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.936
Roger that.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.971
Maria, you got
to get your family

20:39.005 --> 20:40.473
and head to higher ground ASAP.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.709
Thank you. But what
about Scorpion?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.377
We've been in situations
like this before.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.746
We're professionals.
He's still not picking up.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.882
I am gonna cover him in parsley
and feed him to the snails.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.784
Most of the time.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.953
SYLVESTER: Okay, I got eyes
on the Mexican coastline.

20:53.986 --> 20:54.687
What about it?

20:54.721 --> 20:56.022
WALTER:
Does the Mazatlan Shelf

20:56.055 --> 20:57.223
extend into Fuente Roja?

20:57.256 --> 21:00.927
Yes. It forms an underwater
canyon due west of the bay.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.729
Canyon walls are 40 feet tall.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.598
They're 3.7 meters from the
shoreline by the power plant.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.000
Okay, 40 feet...
that's just high enough.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.337
HAPPY: Oh, I think I know
where you're headed, boss.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.439
We ramp the reactor to full
power, pressurize the core

21:12.472 --> 21:14.641
and heat the water
to highly-pressurized steam.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.976
Correct. Then we release that
steam through the intake pipe

21:17.009 --> 21:18.010
and into the ocean.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.846
SYLVESTER: Creating a bubble
that will collapse

21:19.879 --> 21:23.483
the canyon wall,
causing an underwater avalanche.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.651
Sending acoustical
gravitational waves

21:24.684 --> 21:26.653
straight towards the tsunami
and knock that sucker out.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.688
Two years ago,
we created a tsunami

21:28.721 --> 21:30.490
to reverse the flow of a river.

21:30.523 --> 21:33.660
Now we're creating an avalanche
to kill a tsunami?

21:33.693 --> 21:35.862
Can't say
we're not well-rounded.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.864
Cabe, you and I
will increase the number

21:37.897 --> 21:39.098
of uranium rods necessary

21:39.131 --> 21:41.934
to fully power the reactor.
HAPPY: Paige and I can reverse

21:41.968 --> 21:44.003
the turbine fan so it's blowing
all the air from the reactor

21:44.036 --> 21:46.873
into the core, instead of out,
and it can become pressurized.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.841
And then you'll boil the water
in the core

21:48.875 --> 21:49.809
to create the steam bubble.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.744
And then release it
through the intake pipe

21:51.778 --> 21:53.913
directly at the canyon wall.
Let's get to it.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.920
(quietly): When is
Rhonda coming back?

22:00.953 --> 22:02.922
No idea.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.528
Do you think his knuckles are
raw from beating up the cheater?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.397
It's not from
tenderizing chicken.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.034
Hey, Lugo, how's the family?

22:15.067 --> 22:17.003
Your mom still smoke
those Guatemalan cigars?

22:20.573 --> 22:22.775
Finally. Was getting worried you
were gonna back out on our deal.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.111
I had to make some calls.
So, can you "Help Me, Rhonda"?

22:25.144 --> 22:29.048
That wasn't funny years ago
and it ain't funny now.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.883
Here's where you can find

22:30.917 --> 22:32.452
the guy who has
her paperwork.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.120
And you're not
gonna like it.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.088
Pinto Goochelli?

22:36.122 --> 22:37.957
The guy who locked you
in the car trunk.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.091
Multiple car trunks.
No, no, no.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.960
The Gooch works the East Coast.
What's he doing here?

22:40.993 --> 22:43.129
Franchising.
What the hell do I care?

22:43.162 --> 22:47.767
Oh. And by the way, he's the guy
I sold your bad debt to.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.002
Oh, crap.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.843
(groans) Damn bolts
are old and stripped.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.811
Okay, hold this.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.718
Okay.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.820
Uh, that is good enough to get

23:07.854 --> 23:09.989
to the controls
to reverse the turbine.

23:10.022 --> 23:13.493
Um... that was
pretty impressive.

23:13.526 --> 23:16.062
Yeah? I just imagined
it was Toby's neck.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.064
Happy, Toby loves you.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.999
I don't know what he's doing
at that address with Amy,

23:20.032 --> 23:20.933
but it's not
what you think.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.869
He wouldn't jeopardize
your relationship.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.604
He's trying to have a baby
with you, for Pete's sake.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.006
Okay, here's an idea:
you take that socket wrench,

23:27.039 --> 23:29.208
you head to the beach,
and you loosen the bolt locks

23:29.241 --> 23:31.010
on the intake pipe
release valve.

23:31.043 --> 23:34.013
And I will meet you there
when I am finished here.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.583
You want me gone so you don't
have to talk about something

23:36.616 --> 23:38.117
that's clearly
bothering you.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.852
Right on both counts.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.087
Now beat it.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.955
Fine.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.627
(phone beeps)

23:49.261 --> 23:53.099
(ringtone, Happy's voice):
Attaboy. Attaboy.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.867
Attaboy.
(phone beeps)

23:56.168 --> 23:56.836
You should call her.

23:56.869 --> 23:58.838
That would be
a bad idea.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.173
My Happy isn't always so happy.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.175
You know, with the way
that things ended between us,

24:03.209 --> 24:04.010
I never imagined
you would've

24:04.043 --> 24:05.978
stuck your neck out
like this for me.

24:06.012 --> 24:10.016
The way things ended with us
was completely my fault,

24:10.049 --> 24:12.018
with the gambling and...

24:12.051 --> 24:14.754
getting into trouble
and losing all your money.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.088
You were a mess.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.090
But you turned it around, pal.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.760
Look, I'm-I'm really glad
that, you know, you...

24:20.793 --> 24:22.161
you figured your life out.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.663
Unlike me.
Yeah, I have

24:23.696 --> 24:26.666
a-a failed engagement,
a marriage down the drain.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.134
I'm just...

24:28.167 --> 24:30.136
I'm starting to think
that I'm snakebit, so...

24:30.169 --> 24:32.004
You do know
that that's nonsense, right?

24:32.038 --> 24:34.674
That you're smart and you're
beautiful and you're kind.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.142
You just got engaged
to an addict.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.645
And then you married
Quincy Berkstead,

24:38.678 --> 24:40.112
and he's a schmuck,
so that's on you.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.549
(chuckles)

24:42.582 --> 24:46.853
You know, even in the bad times,
you always made me laugh.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.988
And speaking of bad times,
I still think

24:49.021 --> 24:51.123
that we should call the cops.
Absolutely not.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.159
The Gooch is just gonna deny
having your I.D.,

24:53.192 --> 24:55.795
and then they'll come after us
for being rats.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.730
Okay, but the guy has
his offices in a funeral parlor.

24:57.764 --> 24:58.831
That's unsettling.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.734
The Gooch is
finishing up a call.

25:01.768 --> 25:04.637
He'll be with you
in a couple minutes.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.172
(door closes)

25:06.205 --> 25:09.742
You should get settled.
It's almost showtime.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.143
WALTER:
Okay, all the rods are in place.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.078
Reactor's fully powered.
(alarm buzzes)

25:12.111 --> 25:13.846
Fill the core with water.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.114
(wheel creaks)

25:15.147 --> 25:17.684
(water flowing)

25:17.717 --> 25:18.751
SYLVESTER:
This better work.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.587
NOAA is estimating the tsunami

25:20.620 --> 25:22.321
will hit shore in 11 minutes!

25:22.354 --> 25:25.825
Just about finished the bolt
lock on the intake pipe.

25:25.858 --> 25:26.826
Where's Happy?

25:26.859 --> 25:28.127
Right here!

25:28.160 --> 25:29.195
(grunts)
There.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.097
Okay.

25:31.130 --> 25:34.033
Okay. Uh, the wheel must be
corroded by the salt air.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.868
It's gonna take
both of us

25:35.902 --> 25:37.069
to turn it when it's go time.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.972
WALTER: The steam's building
in the reactor core.

25:40.006 --> 25:40.973
When I say,

25:41.007 --> 25:43.042
turn the valve
and release it into the ocean.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.343
Right, so it creates
a giant bubble that'll

25:44.376 --> 25:45.778
knock down
a giant underwater wall

25:45.812 --> 25:46.979
that'll make giant sound waves

25:47.013 --> 25:49.015
that'll destroy a giant tsunami.

25:49.048 --> 25:49.882
That's the gist of it.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.183
Walter, you better be
right about this.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.885
Well, that depends;
I need to open

25:52.919 --> 25:55.054
two chambers here to release
the steam toward the ocean.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.023
Chamber one has to be opened
before chamber two

25:57.056 --> 25:58.691
or the whole reactor explodes.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.727
Should I do it
in that order, Paige?

26:00.760 --> 26:02.261
What the hell
are you talking about?

26:02.294 --> 26:04.163
Well, according to you,
order of events don't matter.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.265
So if a second kiss
can be a first kiss,

26:06.298 --> 26:08.167
then the second chamber
can be the first chamber.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.336
I might not be able
to identify our first kiss,

26:10.369 --> 26:12.271
but I sure as hell can tell you
when our final kiss was.

26:12.304 --> 26:13.773
It was last night, buddy!

26:13.806 --> 26:14.974
Oh, now you're being childish.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.209
Save the lover's
spat for later.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.611
She's totally wrong.
You're a man.

26:18.645 --> 26:19.646
You should be
on my side.

26:19.679 --> 26:20.713
(rapid beeping)

26:20.747 --> 26:22.248
The core is filled.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.250
Releasing the steam now.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.218
In proper sequential order.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.219
And, Happy,

26:27.253 --> 26:28.320
turn the valve now!

26:28.354 --> 26:31.090
(wheel creaking)

26:31.123 --> 26:33.092
(both grunting)

26:33.125 --> 26:34.193
What the hell?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.162
Where's the steam?

26:36.195 --> 26:37.329
Going through the pipe, right?

26:37.363 --> 26:39.231
No, the PSI gauge is not moving.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.667
WALTER: The steam is
stopped in the pipeline.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.768
There's a blockage.
(rumbling)

26:41.801 --> 26:44.103
Oh, man.
This place is gonna blow.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.974
(rumbling continues)
Not good.

26:53.412 --> 26:55.014
It's a pipe
that only carries steam.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.082
What could possibly
be blocking it?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.950
I bet the earthquake damaged
the interior baffles.

26:57.984 --> 27:00.252
We turn the wheel up here,
but nothing happens in there.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.689
I'm trying to find a backup
override to open it up,

27:02.722 --> 27:03.990
but I'm not finding anything.

27:04.924 --> 27:05.892
What are you doing?

27:05.925 --> 27:07.894
If I don't open those baffles,

27:07.927 --> 27:09.829
the reactor blows,
the tsunami hits,

27:09.862 --> 27:11.964
and the only one
who survives this is Toby.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.299
And that'll really piss me off.

27:13.332 --> 27:14.233
SYLVESTER:
Um...

27:14.266 --> 27:15.367
what about me? I'd survive.

27:15.401 --> 27:16.402
Right. Sly, if I die,

27:16.435 --> 27:18.270
you give Toby a gooty-punch
when you see him.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.239
I'd prefer not.
CABE:
Happy, if you go in that pipe

27:20.272 --> 27:23.642
and open up those baffles,
that steam'll cook you alive.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.146
The plant oil dispersant!

27:28.815 --> 27:31.050
If it has the right composition,
it could work.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.419
Okay, it's, uh, silicon-based.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.354
Similar to the compound

27:35.387 --> 27:38.725
stuntmen use for protection
when they get lit on fire.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.993
I can use it.
SYLVESTER:
You need to be totally covered.

27:41.027 --> 27:44.396
Any portion of your body
that is exposed will be roasted!

27:44.430 --> 27:45.832
Happy, it's too risky.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.834
We need to find another way.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.436
Too late.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.304
I'm dousing her in
dispersant as we speak.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.439
No, Happy! I'm your boss.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.008
You are my employee, and
I'm telling you not to do this.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.310
Wait until I get there,
and I will go down in the pipe.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.445
Okay? Do you understand?

27:59.478 --> 28:02.214
I understand that you're
on the other side of the plant

28:02.248 --> 28:03.482
and it'll take several minutes

28:03.515 --> 28:05.084
for you to get here
and we don't have time.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.085
Don't worry, boss.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.486
I won't ask for workers' comp.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.388
That's not funny!
The goop will only protect you

28:09.421 --> 28:11.390
for a few seconds down there!

28:11.423 --> 28:12.491
That's all it'll take
for the steam

28:12.524 --> 28:15.394
to blast out of there.
Okay, Happy, close your eyes.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.699
Okay. Ready?

28:27.940 --> 28:29.108
(exhales)

28:31.778 --> 28:34.747
Tell Sylvester not to punch Toby
in the crotch.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.415
Okay.

28:36.448 --> 28:39.418
And tell Toby
that I really did love him.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.220
You tell him yourself.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.955
SYLVESTER: Paige,
you got to close that hatch.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.356
We're down
to our last five minutes.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.428
(pipes creaking, knocking)

28:53.499 --> 28:55.301
SYLVESTER: Happy, according to
the schematics, you should be

28:55.334 --> 28:56.435
coming up on the baffles.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.174
I see 'em!

29:02.208 --> 29:04.043
WALTER:
Before you open them, you need
to make sure that your eyes

29:04.076 --> 29:06.278
are closed and you don't breathe
in for at least ten seconds.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.414
The steam will blast
over you incredibly fast.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.383
But if you inhale at all,
you will fry your lungs.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.385
Got it.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.321
Okay. On three.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.490
One,

29:18.524 --> 29:20.392
two,

29:20.426 --> 29:21.293
three!

29:26.465 --> 29:28.500
She did it! Steam's rushing
through the pipe!

29:28.534 --> 29:30.036
Ooh. It's hot as hell.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.370
I can't believe she's in there.

29:31.403 --> 29:34.974
The steam is creating
a giant bubble. Hold on.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.012
Canyon walls are collapsing.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.413
I'm pulling up a reading

29:41.447 --> 29:43.582
on severe acoustical
gravitational waves

29:43.615 --> 29:45.317
headed out towards the tsunami.

29:45.351 --> 29:47.854
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

29:47.887 --> 29:50.389
No more PSI! Steam's gone!

29:50.422 --> 29:52.391
Happy! Happy!

29:52.424 --> 29:54.193
Oh, God, please answer! Happy!

29:54.226 --> 29:55.394
HAPPY:
Shut your yap!

29:55.427 --> 29:57.930
It echoes in here!

29:57.964 --> 30:00.432
(panting)

30:00.466 --> 30:04.336
Man, I feel like a baked potato.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.872
Are you okay?

30:05.905 --> 30:08.340
I've been better. A little warm.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.177
Walt, is this gonna work?

30:11.210 --> 30:13.846
It better. Or in three minutes,
it's our funeral.

30:14.881 --> 30:17.249
THE GOOCH: So you want
your name back?

30:17.283 --> 30:19.351
Her name, Social Security
number, credit rating--

30:19.385 --> 30:20.419
the whole kit
and caboodle.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.421
Anything else?

30:22.454 --> 30:24.456
Cup of tea?
Sure.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.492
Some cookies?
That sounds lovely.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.494
Foot massage?
You're just being ridiculous.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.363
No, you're being suicidal.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.432
You come here when
you're on the wrong side

30:33.465 --> 30:35.501
of my balance sheet,
and you ask for a favor?

30:35.534 --> 30:37.636
When you should really
be asking for mercy.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.571
Toby, what do I look like?

30:39.605 --> 30:41.874
Jason Statham's uglier brother.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.543
(chuckles)

30:44.576 --> 30:46.445
You have a death wish.

30:46.478 --> 30:47.646
No. I don't.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.315
But I do have something
that you need.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.617
I got a brain that can
profile and can compute

30:51.650 --> 30:53.452
faster than any
gambler you know.

30:53.485 --> 30:56.488
And it's yours if you just give
my friend her paper back.

30:59.491 --> 31:00.927
I don't follow.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.594
I'll break down every
college quarterback

31:02.628 --> 31:04.463
with a drinking problem,

31:04.496 --> 31:07.266
every point guard who's gonna
choke with the game on the line,

31:07.299 --> 31:09.635
every angle that
the linemakers miss but I see.

31:09.668 --> 31:10.502
I'll give it
to you, Gooch.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.638
I'm gonna give you
the inside scoop,

31:12.671 --> 31:14.306
and you will clean up.

31:14.340 --> 31:18.510
If you could still do that,
you'd be doing it.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.213
But from what I hear,

31:21.247 --> 31:23.249
you don't like
the action anymore.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.317
I do. I love it.

31:25.351 --> 31:28.554
I just promised someone
I'd break the habit, but...

31:28.587 --> 31:30.589
things have changed.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.659
What do you say?
We got a deal?

31:37.363 --> 31:40.166
I'm new to town.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.634
I show mercy to a guy who owes,

31:42.668 --> 31:45.037
and I'm a mutt.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.272
So...

31:46.305 --> 31:47.606
I'm just gonna kill you instead.

31:47.639 --> 31:50.109
(voice cracks): Huh?
Grab her.

31:50.142 --> 31:52.678
No. No! Toby? Toby!
No, no, no, no.

31:52.711 --> 31:53.980
Come on, we don't
have to do this.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.181
No. Toby, please...

31:55.214 --> 31:57.083
We're old pals! (screams)

31:57.116 --> 31:58.350
(grunts)

32:00.719 --> 32:03.622
SYLVESTER:
Guys, the gravitational wave
will hit the tsunami

32:03.655 --> 32:05.391
in ten seconds; plug your ears!

32:05.424 --> 32:06.492
Why plug our ears?

32:06.525 --> 32:08.727
Because a sonic boom
will follow the wave collision.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.596
At least, I think that's
the order it happens.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.999
Lately, I seem unable
to figure out which comes first.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.600
(groans)
Time to plug my ears.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.235
You just can't stand
to hear the truth.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.637
(deep booming)

32:19.771 --> 32:22.108
Did it work?

32:22.141 --> 32:24.043
There is still a wave
heading towards you.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.511
Theoretically, it should be

32:25.544 --> 32:28.114
less strong and much smaller,
but there's no way to tell

32:28.147 --> 32:29.715
until it's right on top of you.

32:29.748 --> 32:32.551
I think I see a wave
out there heading inland.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.553
Do we run?
There's no point.

32:34.586 --> 32:37.723
And there's no point
in us fighting.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.658
I don't care which
kiss came first.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.194
I just care that we
kissed. I'm sorry.

32:42.228 --> 32:43.429
Me, too.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.131
SYLVESTER:
Guys, heads up.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.332
The wave will grow rapidly

32:46.365 --> 32:47.766
over the last several meters
to shore.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.635
There's our wave.
It's coming in.

32:49.668 --> 32:50.969
Is it growing?

33:02.481 --> 33:04.750
It's a weenie wave.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.185
So that's it?

33:06.218 --> 33:08.620
No. We take the two-hour flight
back to L.A.,

33:08.654 --> 33:09.888
find Toby, and I kick his ass.

33:09.921 --> 33:12.724
Wait, when you were in the pipe,
you said you still loved him.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.493
That's when I thought
I was gonna die.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.228
Now I've got a tracker
on his key chain,

33:16.262 --> 33:17.663
and I don't want
to breach that trust,

33:17.696 --> 33:21.400
but he's forced my hand,
so I'm gonna go hunt him down.

33:21.433 --> 33:24.503
Who'd have thought Toby'd
be the one to die today?

33:32.811 --> 33:36.415
Where the hell is he?
It's been three hours.

33:36.448 --> 33:39.318
He said he had to get
some guys to help.

33:39.351 --> 33:42.454
He'll be here.

33:42.488 --> 33:45.157
If they were gonna kill us, why
don't they just do it already?

33:45.191 --> 33:47.093
I assume they're waiting
to find someone

33:47.126 --> 33:49.428
who can dispose of
a casket and two bodies.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.629
(sighs)
God...

33:50.662 --> 33:52.831
Amy, I am so sorry.

33:52.864 --> 33:55.134
I just keep
messing your life up.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.502
No, you were
trying to help.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.737
I'm the one who got you
trapped in a coffin.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.139
This is a casket.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.141
Coffin's tapered
at the head and the foot.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.375
Really? That's the
last conversation

34:03.409 --> 34:05.144
that you ever
want to have?

34:05.177 --> 34:06.378
Correcting someone's
word choice?

34:06.412 --> 34:07.579
Probably not.
It's just that you...

34:07.613 --> 34:09.248
you don't want to go out
being wrong about...

34:14.186 --> 34:16.188
Why did you do that?

34:16.222 --> 34:18.224
What do you mean?

34:18.257 --> 34:20.359
You told the Gooch that
things had changed.

34:20.392 --> 34:23.329
No, I-I meant that
I had a friend in need,

34:23.362 --> 34:25.331
so I was willing to gamble.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.399
I'm not willing
to gamble my marriage.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.734
Look, I loved
you once, okay?

34:28.767 --> 34:31.170
And I'm scared, and you
tried to help me today,

34:31.203 --> 34:32.871
and it's been a long
time since anyone's done

34:32.904 --> 34:33.772
anything nice for me.
I don't care.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.507
Look, if I only have
a minute to live,

34:35.541 --> 34:37.143
I don't want to spend it
with another woman's lips

34:37.176 --> 34:38.777
on mine; I love Happy.
Shut up. Shh.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.512
I will not shut up.
You made me an adulterer

34:40.546 --> 34:42.681
in my last moments on Earth.
Shut up. I hear something.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.252
Took you long enough.

34:46.285 --> 34:48.120
My cousins were
way up in Ventura.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.721
You didn't give me
advanced notice.
Whatever.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.391
Here. That is a grand more
than you asked for.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.893
So don't mess this up.
Nice, deep,

34:54.926 --> 34:58.197
and in a plot no one visits, so
nobody notices disturbed soil.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.265
I know just the place.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.532
Get the cargo ready.

35:00.566 --> 35:01.733
All right.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.269
Pull that out.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.836
No!
(gasps) Here we go.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.838
Hey, Curtis.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.541
When I see you
in the next life...

35:09.575 --> 35:11.877
I'm still gonna want my money.

35:11.910 --> 35:14.446
(laughing)

35:14.480 --> 35:16.282
CABE: Freeze!
MAN: Hands up!

35:16.315 --> 35:17.449
Don't move!

35:17.483 --> 35:18.784
Easy.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.619
CABE: There's an open
grave over there!

35:20.652 --> 35:23.355
You move an inch, I'm gonna
fill it with your ass!

35:23.389 --> 35:26.258
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

35:26.292 --> 35:28.627
Happy, you don't know
what you're gonna find in there.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.162
Maybe you should let me.

35:30.196 --> 35:31.163
No, I got it.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.802
Happy?

35:36.835 --> 35:39.605
Jackass.
I see your back's better.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.207
This is not
what it looks like.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.908
Really? It looks like
you're gooty to gooty

35:42.941 --> 35:44.310
with your ex in a coffin.

35:44.343 --> 35:46.745
It's a casket, actually.
A coffin is tapered...

35:53.385 --> 35:55.421
âª

35:57.989 --> 36:00.526
âª Yeah, yeah, yeah...

36:00.559 --> 36:02.728
Look at us.
We may have had

36:02.761 --> 36:05.531
a silly spat today,
but now we are totally in sync.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.867
Absolutely. And if I recall,
NSYNC was the first concert

36:08.900 --> 36:10.536
you went to
as a teenager?
Indeed.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.704
And yours was
Mahler's 9th Symphony

36:12.738 --> 36:14.806
played by
the Dublin Philharmonic.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.941
They were resplendent.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.576
Man, we are gonna
wipe the floors

36:17.609 --> 36:19.311
with those saps tonight.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.747
âª Yeah, yeah, yeah...

36:21.780 --> 36:24.583
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

36:24.616 --> 36:25.851
That we should give them
the desks.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.753
Temporarily, but yes.
They've had a rough day.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.221
Let's give them a win.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.257
I love the way your brain works.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.327
Really?

36:35.361 --> 36:38.230
He signed his name
in gold-flaked ink?

36:38.264 --> 36:40.299
Full name and everything?

36:40.332 --> 36:42.401
Even the "P"?

36:42.434 --> 36:44.370
Don't feel bad, Dyfrost.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.705
It was one autograph
per customer,

36:46.738 --> 36:49.275
and we both know
that J. Randall P. Smythe

36:49.308 --> 36:51.910
does not bend the rules
or make exceptions for anyone.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.380
I guess not even
his biggest fans on Earth.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.419
By Apollo's Healing Hands!

37:00.452 --> 37:02.788
Um...
CABE:
Sly.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.490
I think you know
this gentleman.

37:04.523 --> 37:07.225
J. Randall P. Smythe.

37:08.294 --> 37:09.895
I understand

37:09.928 --> 37:12.464
you couldn't make
my book adorning

37:12.498 --> 37:14.366
due to pressing matters?

37:14.400 --> 37:16.368
Uh, I-I had work.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.636
He had to save
some people.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.606
It's something he's done
on numerous occasions.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.841
How are you here?

37:22.874 --> 37:26.278
Well, I, uh, stopped by
the Wizard's Trunk...

37:26.312 --> 37:27.279
Warlock's Chest.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.781
Whatever. On the way back
from the cemetery

37:29.815 --> 37:32.284
to see if I couldn't get
a couple signed copies,

37:32.318 --> 37:34.453
since you missed it,
and Randall here

37:34.486 --> 37:38.424
heard all that you do and
wanted to meet you personally.

37:38.457 --> 37:41.026
But you never sign
after an event.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.462
Unlike the characters that
spring from my mind to page,

37:43.495 --> 37:44.996
you, Sylvester Dodd,

37:45.030 --> 37:46.598
are a true hero.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.435
It's a pleasure to sign for you.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.519
Thank you!

38:07.553 --> 38:09.087
Okay, well,
Randy here's a busy guy,

38:09.120 --> 38:11.089
so we should let him get going.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.425
Good-bye, brave sir.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.894
(sighs)

38:18.864 --> 38:20.499
So are we good now?

38:20.532 --> 38:24.336
I don't need the IRS looking
into my appearance fees.

38:24.370 --> 38:29.475
And they won't be, as long as
you sign my copy, too.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.510
And don't forget the "P."

38:33.512 --> 38:35.514
(door opens, closes)

38:37.416 --> 38:39.551
Here's your coffee.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.453
If you think
coffee can fix this,

38:41.487 --> 38:43.489
you are more delusional
than I thought.
Nothing happened.

38:46.725 --> 38:49.495
Except we kissed-- but she
initiated it, and I stopped it.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.063
And I would never do anything
with her or anyone else,

38:52.097 --> 38:53.298
you got to believe me.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.402
I believe you. I never thought
you were stepping out on me.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.670
Well, Paige said that
you've been pissed all day.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.773
Because I know you used to go
to Koreatown to gamble, stupid.

39:01.807 --> 39:05.677
I have spent years fixing you
from the mess that you were.

39:05.711 --> 39:08.447
And then some chick
from the past gets you to go

39:08.480 --> 39:10.882
to all the backroom games
and loan shark huts

39:10.916 --> 39:12.050
that used to get you
into trouble.

39:12.083 --> 39:15.487
And we both know how bad you can
get when you lose control.

39:15.521 --> 39:19.057
I love you.
We're trying to make a baby.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.993
And I cannot let you
lose control again.

39:25.497 --> 39:27.499
I can't lose you.

39:29.501 --> 39:32.838
I'm sorry I made you worry.

39:32.871 --> 39:36.174
You know, there were temptations
that would've broken other men--

39:36.207 --> 39:39.144
gambling and casket kissing.

39:41.480 --> 39:45.651
Those other men don't have
Happy Quinn to lose, but I do.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.989
I'm never gonna be
a mess again, Happy.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.958
You don't have
to worry about that.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.128
Guys.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.698
We made a decision
about the desks.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.833
No, no, we had a deal.
You can't chicken out

40:01.867 --> 40:03.602
just because you guys
were fighting all day.

40:03.635 --> 40:04.570
We're not chickening out.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.538
(both clucking)

40:08.206 --> 40:09.575
(clucking continues)

40:09.608 --> 40:11.577
You know what, let's
kick their asses.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.678
Absolutely.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.446
Shall we? Hmm.
Yeah.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.515
Mind if we query first?

40:16.548 --> 40:18.149
Well, it makes
no difference.

40:18.183 --> 40:21.853
Paige and I are completely in
sync; no matter what the order

40:21.887 --> 40:23.855
or the question,
we will be victorious.

40:23.889 --> 40:26.057
Fine. Here we go.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.126
"A query, my deary:

40:28.159 --> 40:30.662
Where did you first kiss
your deary?"

40:30.696 --> 40:32.631
In the garage.
Kovelsky's.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.900
BOTH:
Damn it.
