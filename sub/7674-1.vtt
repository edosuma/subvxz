03:30.493 --> 03:35.362
Did that bad monster try to fight
with Muddy's little baby? My darling.

03:35.765 --> 03:39.792
You sure are nice and sweet,
but you need perfume on your breath.

03:40.036 --> 03:41.867
- Good morning, Olive.
- Good morning.

03:41.971 --> 03:45.202
Good grief. Women should leave
beasts like that at home.

03:45.275 --> 03:48.767
But my little Lillikins is different.
She's her Muddy's little playmate.

03:48.845 --> 03:50.972
Olive, here's her special drinking water.

03:51.047 --> 03:52.981
She never wants to drink, Mrs. Van Adams.

03:53.049 --> 03:57.076
You never can tell. Some day, she may.
If she cries for me, tell her that...

03:57.153 --> 04:00.850
...Muddy's making herself beautiful
just to play with little Lillikins.

04:00.924 --> 04:03.415
Mrs. Carter and I are being done together.
Is she here?

04:03.493 --> 04:07.122
Yes. You're going to have a manicure,
shampoo, facial and everything.

04:07.797 --> 04:11.198
- Look at Sydney's miniatures.
- Sure sign of a petty mind.

04:11.267 --> 04:14.703
They've been waiting half an hour.
You could see the art exhibit later.

04:14.771 --> 04:16.738
All right. Art exhibit, my foot.

04:16.805 --> 04:19.331
Would you remove your hat?
Sit here, Mrs. Spencer.

04:19.409 --> 04:20.740
How fascinating.

04:20.810 --> 04:24.109
- Put your face in there and be quiet.
- Let me see!

04:24.747 --> 04:29.582
I hate to tell you dear, but your skin
makes the Rockies look like chiffon velvet.

04:32.789 --> 04:36.418
Only half a minute more, Mrs. Miller,
and you can talk again.

04:36.492 --> 04:38.824
I beg your pardon.
I'm looking for Grandma.

04:38.895 --> 04:41.659
- Grandma isn't in there.
- She isn't in here.

04:41.731 --> 04:45.758
This mud has worms in it!
I know it has worms in it! I can feel them.

04:45.835 --> 04:48.065
They're more scared of you
than you are of them.

04:48.137 --> 04:51.038
What's a little worm?
At Harvard and Yale, they eat them.

04:51.107 --> 04:55.009
- Relax. Rest and close your eyes.
- All right.

04:55.345 --> 04:59.338
But I still say I'm going to pull a gun
on him, just like I did on Judge McClure.

04:59.415 --> 05:02.612
I'm coming. My dears!

05:02.752 --> 05:05.744
That solid mountain of flesh
is going to marry a jockey.

05:05.989 --> 05:10.085
- Won't her husband turn over in his grave?
- What's she got in common with a jockey?

05:10.159 --> 05:11.285
Horse feathers.

05:12.662 --> 05:13.686
Yes, miss?

05:13.763 --> 05:17.028
She's all right, Miss Spencer.
She's my press agent.

05:17.133 --> 05:21.092
Has anybody seen my grandmother?
She's Southern. Thank you.

05:21.204 --> 05:23.195
The South is in that direction.

05:25.975 --> 05:28.000
- Grandma!
- Hello, darling.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.102
- Where have you been?
- Four miles.

05:30.179 --> 05:33.273
- May I go to the fights tonight?
- Not without me.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.309
Is Miss Atkinson here?

05:43.059 --> 05:45.186
You don't look a day over 35.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.752
That old gasoline truck.
She's 60 if she's a minute.

05:47.830 --> 05:49.354
- Who is she?
- Gillingswater.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.662
One more permanent
and she won't have a hair left.

05:51.734 --> 05:54.567
- She's got a lot on her arms.
- She does shed, doesn't she?

05:55.438 --> 05:56.370
It's the newest color, Jungle Red.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.771
- What?
- It's the newest color, Jungle Red.

05:58.841 --> 06:02.436
One of the girls recognized his name
from Cholly Knickerbocker's column...

06:02.512 --> 06:03.501
...and it was Haines.

06:03.579 --> 06:05.308
- What did you say the name was?
- Haines.

06:05.715 --> 06:07.080
How do you know?

06:07.150 --> 06:09.414
Two weeks ago I passed by
where Crystal lives.

06:09.485 --> 06:12.682
The landlady said she'd moved
to be with her gentleman friend.

06:12.755 --> 06:16.282
- ''What gentleman <i>friend,''</i> I said...
- Shut it off. I can't hear a thing!

06:16.359 --> 06:18.987
Hazel! Hurry, get the pins out.
I want to get out!

06:24.534 --> 06:27.992
- Boo! I'm an elevator man!
- Don't frighten Mother, dear.

06:28.271 --> 06:30.000
Run along, darlings.

06:31.407 --> 06:34.899
The lambs! Are you sure they are dressed
warm enough? Hello?

06:35.178 --> 06:39.512
Edith? Take a good grip on yourself.
You're going to die.

06:40.349 --> 06:42.647
Stephen Haines is stepping out on Mary.

06:43.486 --> 06:47.115
- What?
- All aboard for the main lobby.

06:48.291 --> 06:50.316
Yes. Run along now, children.

06:50.927 --> 06:53.327
But, Sylvia darling, who told you?

06:53.963 --> 06:58.332
A manicurist? Go on.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.231
This manicurist,
she's perfectly divine, she said to me:

07:01.304 --> 07:03.272
<i>''I</i> know something about
rich Mrs. <i>Haines.''</i>

07:07.543 --> 07:11.980
But, Sylvia, suppose Mary should
hear about it? Wouldn't it be terrible?

07:12.081 --> 07:13.673
Wouldn't it be ghastly?

07:14.283 --> 07:17.150
But, darling,
we've got to face her at lunch today.

07:17.453 --> 07:19.887
Won't it be too tragic?

07:20.189 --> 07:22.657
Eating her food
and knowing all about her husband!

07:22.892 --> 07:27.022
Darling, I'll burst until I get the details,
but I've got to see that filthy doctor.

07:27.096 --> 07:31.157
Yes, you know, my regular checkup.
Goodbye, darling.

07:37.240 --> 07:40.801
Operator, will you give me
Great Neck 8125, please.

07:41.477 --> 07:44.913
Will you tone her down? This is a toll call.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.707
Hello, this is Mrs. Potter speaking.

07:48.818 --> 07:51.878
Will you tell Mrs. Haines
not to wait lunch for me?

07:51.954 --> 07:56.391
No, tell her I have to see my doctor,
but I'll make it just as soon as I can.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.351
Mrs. Haines is out riding now
with Little Mary, but I'll let her know.

08:07.770 --> 08:09.635
Mother, will you tell Daddy I beat you.
Will you tell him?

08:09.705 --> 08:13.607
- lf I tell him, he'll think I'm conceited.
- He'll be awfully disappointed in me.

08:13.676 --> 08:18.238
- But you're so solid with him anyway.
- You think so! All right, I'll tell him.

08:18.814 --> 08:22.079
And to prove it beyond doubt,
I'll photograph the finish!

08:22.151 --> 08:23.277
Swell!

08:27.356 --> 08:30.382
Lickety-split now!
It's got to look like the real McCoy.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.924
All right, Mother. Here I come.

08:40.001 --> 08:41.400
The winner!

08:42.304 --> 08:46.401
- I'll have to borrow your horse next time.
- I could beat you with any horse.

08:46.475 --> 08:48.705
Let me take you now, Mother.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.770
Wait a minute. Look at that one.

08:54.383 --> 08:55.315
How's that?

08:55.384 --> 08:57.477
Look out there.
You're shooting us on the bias.

08:57.553 --> 08:59.919
I meant to. That's artistic.

09:00.156 --> 09:03.455
That won't impress Daddy.
He's heard that one before.

09:04.660 --> 09:07.026
- How is this for artistic?
- That's swell.

09:07.096 --> 09:08.586
Hold it. Still.

09:13.869 --> 09:15.803
My goodness! What a racket.

09:15.871 --> 09:18.499
If this was an angel cake,
it would fall like a board.

09:18.574 --> 09:21.008
Any great ideas about
dessert tonight, Ingrid?

09:21.077 --> 09:23.637
- Baked apples.
- What? No charlotte russe?

09:23.713 --> 09:26.546
- You never eat it, and he shouldn't.
- Why?

09:26.616 --> 09:30.108
Because he sits in an office all day,
and most every night too, lately.

09:30.186 --> 09:33.417
That's why he should be pampered.
It's our last dinner at home.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.322
We'll be up in Canada for two weeks,
living like pioneers.

09:36.392 --> 09:38.553
I'll be cooking, so you know what he'll get.

09:38.628 --> 09:40.459
I know. Indigestion.

09:41.397 --> 09:46.300
You can't fool me. You cook for him
like a French chef all the time you're away.

09:46.502 --> 09:50.939
I was looking for my cookbook
this morning, and I found it in your trunk.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.367
- I'll bring it back.
- I hope.

09:53.509 --> 09:56.444
What kind of food
do you want for him tonight?

09:57.280 --> 10:00.807
- Pancakes Barbara.
- Ridiculous. 20 pounds right off.

10:00.883 --> 10:04.046
- Come on.
- All right, if you say so.

10:04.387 --> 10:08.983
But that adonis figure of his won't last
forever without help from the kitchen.

10:23.773 --> 10:27.436
- Mother, I'm helping you to pack.
- Thanks, darling.

10:27.510 --> 10:30.411
Sheba, get off Daddy's coat.

10:33.449 --> 10:36.850
You don't want to take this old thing
along with Daddy, do you?

10:36.919 --> 10:39.046
- What old thing, dear?
- This.

10:39.789 --> 10:44.385
Old thing? What do you mean, old thing?

10:44.460 --> 10:47.156
- Daddy never wears that coat.
- Yes, he does.

10:47.229 --> 10:51.029
Whenever we go away on trips together,
hunting and fishing.

10:51.634 --> 10:54.296
- Where did you get those?
- I found them in here.

10:59.508 --> 11:03.877
- We took those on our honeymoon.
- You did? Where was your honeymoon?

11:03.946 --> 11:06.779
Up in Canada,
where we're going tomorrow.

11:11.754 --> 11:15.087
You know, that's the spot
where I caught that famous fish.

11:15.157 --> 11:20.026
Goodness gracious! It isn't such a big fish,
though, is it, Mother?

11:20.663 --> 11:24.326
The big fish aren't always
the most important, you know.

11:25.368 --> 11:28.166
When I first married Daddy,
I couldn't fish worth a cent.

11:28.237 --> 11:29.704
He started to teach me.

11:29.772 --> 11:34.072
The first thing I learned was how
to cast a fly. And then I caught that fish!

11:34.143 --> 11:36.543
And Daddy said
he'd have to have it stuffed...

11:36.612 --> 11:39.945
...in case I never catch another.

11:41.183 --> 11:44.050
- But you do catch others?
- Millions of them.

11:44.286 --> 11:47.619
It's only nip and tuck now who makes
the biggest catch, Daddy or me.

11:47.690 --> 11:50.887
- Does it make Daddy jealous?
- Furious. We have terrific battles.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.587
Now you're just fooling.

11:53.028 --> 11:56.122
- Where's Daddy in this one?
- He's probably taking the picture.

11:56.198 --> 11:59.998
- I see his shadow, there in the snow.
- That's right.

12:01.904 --> 12:03.565
I remember that morning.

12:03.639 --> 12:07.939
It snowed during the night and we had to
dig our way out of the cabin.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.443
We were snowbound for two whole days.

12:11.514 --> 12:14.074
- Like in a movie?
- Yes, darling.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.510
Were your lives in danger?

12:20.022 --> 12:23.753
Hardly. But it was very romantic, anyway.

12:25.394 --> 12:28.090
I think that kind
of lovey-dovey stuff is silly.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.463
You do?
What do you know about it, anyway?

12:32.868 --> 12:34.335
Mother?

12:34.403 --> 12:37.861
What do you and Daddy talk about
when I'm not around?

12:39.074 --> 12:43.204
- I don't know. Everything.
- You do an awful lot of laughing.

12:43.379 --> 12:45.370
- Do we?
- I hear you sometimes.

12:45.448 --> 12:48.008
- You shouldn't be listening.
- What do you laugh at?

12:49.018 --> 12:51.418
Little jokes. Lots of things.

12:51.487 --> 12:54.456
- Do you love Daddy better than me?
- What?

12:55.157 --> 12:57.352
Whatever gave you such an idea?

12:57.426 --> 13:00.395
Ingrid says you love him
better than anyone.

13:00.696 --> 13:04.792
That's a different kind of love.
You'll find out when you grow up.

13:05.334 --> 13:06.631
Will I?

13:06.702 --> 13:10.536
When I do,
I hope that I won't think it's silly.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.009
The lunch guests have started to arrive.

13:15.077 --> 13:17.068
Let me pick out your dress.

13:17.146 --> 13:19.706
- They'll be fancy, why not be plain?
- Let's hurry.

13:20.416 --> 13:22.543
- How do you do, Mrs. Potter?
- Hello, Jane.

13:22.618 --> 13:24.552
- How are you feeling today?
- Too awful.

13:24.620 --> 13:27.384
I wouldn't wish my woes
on my worst friend.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.692
Will you tell Mrs. Fowler
that I'd like to talk to her for a moment?

13:32.061 --> 13:33.221
Yes, Mrs. Potter.

13:33.529 --> 13:36.930
- How's the little mother?
- Jane, never mind about that.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.192
Hello, dear.

13:38.367 --> 13:40.562
The spider's in the parlor. Let's join her.

13:40.636 --> 13:43.366
I said, ''Do you expect me to stay home
and darn your socks?

13:43.439 --> 13:46.875
- ''Why do we keep servants? <i>''</i>
- You don't keep them long.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.136
Great guns, what are you made up for?
''The Seeing <i>Eye''?</i>

13:50.212 --> 13:52.578
You better save your cracks
for your next book.

13:52.648 --> 13:56.277
- Edith, you must have dashed.
- I broke every speed record.

13:59.021 --> 14:02.047
- Weren't you going to Africa to shoot?
- As soon as my book's out.

14:02.124 --> 14:06.458
I'd rather face a tiger than the things
the critics said about your last book.

14:06.795 --> 14:10.390
- Isn't this divine of Mary and the little girl?
- Let's see.

14:10.533 --> 14:12.228
What does it say?

14:12.468 --> 14:15.494
Leave it to Mary to see
she's photographed from her best angle.

14:15.571 --> 14:16.560
Is that so?

14:16.639 --> 14:18.800
What will you write next? Animal stories?

14:18.874 --> 14:21.502
I wouldn't have to go to Africa for that.

14:21.577 --> 14:24.410
I wish I could make a little money writing,
the way you do.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.778
If you wrote the way I do,
that's what you'd make.

14:26.882 --> 14:29.851
- You're not a very popular author, are you?
- Not with you.

14:29.919 --> 14:32.444
Best angle, my foot.
It doesn't half do her justice.

14:32.521 --> 14:33.920
You'll have some sherry?

14:33.989 --> 14:36.685
I'll take it. Peggy never seems
to connect very well.

14:36.759 --> 14:38.090
- I'm sorry.
- Let me see.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.960
She's in love, bless her. After the child's
been married as long as you...

14:42.031 --> 14:44.932
...she may be able to concentrate
on matters like cocktails.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.094
- Another lecture on the modern woman.
- At the drop of a hat.

14:48.170 --> 14:52.129
I consider myself a perfectly good wife.
I've sacrificed a lot for Howard Fowler.

14:52.207 --> 14:53.299
Smoked oysters.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.969
Don't mention smoked oysters.
They turn me green.

14:56.045 --> 14:57.410
You are a bore.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.845
Lay off my reputation, girls,
while I unswallow.

14:59.915 --> 15:00.904
Please.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.777
- Isn't Little Mary a dream?
- I wish I could afford to have a baby.

15:06.855 --> 15:09.756
You never will
if your bridge game doesn't improve.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.350
I'm devoted to Edith Potter,
but she gets me down.

15:12.428 --> 15:14.726
I don't blame her husband
for being bored with her.

15:14.797 --> 15:18.597
- What makes you think Mr. Potter is...
- My dear, he's one of those flirty types.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.465
Loves to kiss all the girls.
I told him off one time.

15:21.537 --> 15:24.973
I said, ''Look, one more smack,
and I'll go straight to Edith! <i>''</i>

15:25.040 --> 15:27.531
- Did you?
- Of course not.

15:27.610 --> 15:29.407
I'd die before I'd hurt Edith.

15:29.478 --> 15:32.379
- Nuts.
- Thanks, dear.

15:33.182 --> 15:37.118
Heaven be praised, I'm on to my husband.
I wouldn't trust him on Alcatraz.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.781
You oughtn't to talk about him like that.
I think it's disloyal.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.087
Do we know how the men talk
about us when we're not around?

15:44.159 --> 15:46.286
- I've heard rumors.
- Exactly.

15:47.496 --> 15:48.986
While we're on the subject...

15:49.064 --> 15:52.830
...have you wondered if the master
of this <i>maison</i> might not be straying?

15:52.901 --> 15:54.163
I haven't.

15:54.436 --> 15:57.530
Mary Haines may be living
in a fool's paradise.

15:57.606 --> 16:00.632
You're so resourceful.
I ought to go to you for plots.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.199
You ought to go to someone.

16:02.277 --> 16:06.737
- All over, dear?
- False alarm. Have you finished with me?

16:06.815 --> 16:08.510
Long ago. We're on our hostess.

16:08.584 --> 16:12.577
I think Mary's being very wise,
snatching Stephen Haines off to Canada.

16:12.655 --> 16:15.886
You just can't bear Mary's happiness,
can you? It gets you down.

16:15.958 --> 16:20.292
- How ridiculous. Why should it?
- She's contented to be what she is.

16:20.362 --> 16:22.125
- Which is what?
- A woman.

16:22.197 --> 16:24.461
- And what are we?
- Females.

16:24.533 --> 16:26.831
Really? And what are you, pet?

16:27.002 --> 16:30.631
What nature abhors.
An old maid. A frozen asset.

16:31.206 --> 16:35.040
- Come on. Let's see what's keeping Mary.
- Run along, children.

16:36.311 --> 16:40.111
I thought I'd never get you alone.
I can't wait to get the lowdown.

16:40.182 --> 16:43.948
You're going to swoon when I tell you.
You know I go to Sydney's for my hair.

16:44.019 --> 16:46.487
You should go, pet.
I despise whoever does yours.

16:46.555 --> 16:48.785
I know it looks awful.
Never mind. Hurry up.

16:48.857 --> 16:51.985
This manicurist, Olga, is a riot.
Isn't that divine? Jungle Red.

16:52.061 --> 16:53.494
Simply divine. Go on.

16:53.562 --> 16:55.757
I was looking at <i>Vogue,</i>
the one with Mary in it.

16:55.831 --> 16:58.163
The one with the wig
that flatters her so much?

16:58.233 --> 17:01.293
That started this girl on Mary,
and the whole story rolled out.

17:01.370 --> 17:04.601
- Is it someone we know?
- No. That's what's so awful about it.

17:04.839 --> 17:08.276
- She sells perfume at Black's Fifth Avenue.
- Black's?

17:10.445 --> 17:14.007
It wouldn't be so bad if he'd picked
someone of his class. But a beezle!

17:14.083 --> 17:16.210
How did he meet a girl like that?

17:16.285 --> 17:19.117
How do men ever meet girls like that?
They live for that.

17:19.188 --> 17:21.383
Somebody should shut that manicurist up.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.652
A piece of scandal like that? Not a chance.

17:23.726 --> 17:26.593
She never stops talking.
You know how those creatures are.

17:26.662 --> 17:29.187
Never let up.
A lot they care whose lives they ruin.

17:29.264 --> 17:32.199
10 cents! It's fine to be homespun
in the country, but really.

17:32.267 --> 17:34.394
- Isn't it a dirty trick?
- Isn't it foul?

17:34.470 --> 17:37.200
Cheap Chinese embroidery.
I'll bet Peggy gave her these.

17:37.272 --> 17:40.605
It wouldn't be so bad if only we knew.
We could keep our mouths shut.

17:40.676 --> 17:43.509
I know plenty I'd never breathe
about my friends' husbands.

17:43.579 --> 17:45.069
So do I.

17:47.416 --> 17:49.816
- You know I adore Mary.
- I worship her.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.150
We're not only cousins.
She's my best friend.

17:52.221 --> 17:54.883
We were raised together.
I forgot to tell <i>you...</i>

17:54.957 --> 17:57.118
- Break it up, girls.
- Darling!

17:57.192 --> 18:00.787
- Hello!
- You're so slim, I could kill you.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.595
You don't have to.
The diet I'm on is pure poison.

18:03.665 --> 18:06.327
How can you exercise all day,
and look so contented?

18:06.401 --> 18:08.369
It's a trick I learned from the cows.

18:08.437 --> 18:11.304
- Sorry to be late, girls.
- We haven't had a dull moment.

18:11.373 --> 18:13.432
Sylvia, feeling better?

18:13.675 --> 18:14.699
Meaning what?

18:14.777 --> 18:17.610
You and Edith look so relaxed.
It must have been choice.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.668
It was.

18:18.747 --> 18:23.548
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. How's Stevie?

18:23.619 --> 18:26.053
Not so well lately.

18:26.288 --> 18:28.688
- What's the trouble?
- Jumpy nerves, I guess.

18:28.757 --> 18:31.123
Phelps has had nervous indigestion
for years.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.321
You should hear him rumble.
Like a truck on cobblestones.

18:34.396 --> 18:36.660
- Lunch is served.
- Thanks, Jane.

18:36.732 --> 18:39.667
- There's nothing worrying Steve, is there?
- I don't think so.

18:39.735 --> 18:42.636
He's been working too late
the last few weeks, that's all.

18:43.005 --> 18:46.805
Are you sure it's work, darling,
and not a beautiful blonde?

18:47.075 --> 18:50.044
Come on, Sylvia. Let's feed. I'm famished.

18:50.112 --> 18:53.343
- Stephen's a very attractive man.
- Isn't he?

18:53.415 --> 18:56.976
I can't imagine why he hasn't deserted me
for some glamour girl long ago.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.610
Don't be too sure of Methuselah.

18:58.687 --> 19:01.952
I tell Howard, ''lf you manage to make
a fool of me, I'll deserve <i>it.''</i>

19:02.024 --> 19:05.721
- You certainly will.
- Mr. Haines is on the phone.

19:05.961 --> 19:08.589
He probably can't get home to dinner.

19:08.797 --> 19:11.732
''Please don't talk about me
when I'm <i>gone''</i>

19:17.439 --> 19:18.963
Hello, dear.

19:20.976 --> 19:24.673
Stephen! What a bore!

19:27.916 --> 19:30.180
Yes, I'm nearly packed, but...

19:33.055 --> 19:34.886
...I can unpack again.

19:36.625 --> 19:37.922
I know.

19:39.328 --> 19:40.818
I know, darling.

19:41.163 --> 19:45.759
And don't you be too disappointed, either.
It'll be just as nice later on.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.098
Maybe you can make
an early train out tonight.

19:48.170 --> 19:50.695
I'll meet you at the station <i>and...</i>

19:54.543 --> 19:55.908
I see.

19:58.380 --> 20:00.177
I'm sorry, darling.

20:01.817 --> 20:06.186
It's just that Ingrid was going
to outdo herself for you tonight.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.283
All right, sweet. Call me a little later.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.785
Goodbye, dear.

20:26.608 --> 20:29.168
You look as low as a swamp, dear.
What's up?

20:29.244 --> 20:33.374
It's really too disgusting. Stephen can't
get away to go to Canada tomorrow.

20:33.448 --> 20:34.506
He can't?

20:34.583 --> 20:37.381
If the trip's off,
I'll move into town in the morning.

20:37.452 --> 20:39.750
I would if I were you, Mary.

20:40.389 --> 20:43.790
Watercress. I'd just as soon
eat my way across a front lawn.

20:43.859 --> 20:47.351
Sylvia, what did you mean when you said
''Mary was in a fool's <i>paradise''?</i>

20:47.429 --> 20:50.523
She was trying to make a wisecrack
about marriage.

20:50.599 --> 20:54.262
She said, <i>''A</i> woman's paradise
is always a fool's <i>paradise.''</i>

20:54.336 --> 20:58.397
That's not bad, is it, Nancy?
Sylvia, whatever I'm living in, I like it.

20:58.473 --> 21:02.136
- No, thank you.
- Go ahead, dear. No starch. It's gluten.

21:02.244 --> 21:04.872
Did you ever know such a housewife?

21:04.947 --> 21:08.713
- Mary, how do you like that?
- Too adorable.

21:08.784 --> 21:12.413
You have no idea how it stays on.
I get it at Sydney's. You should go.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.584
A wonderful new manicurist. Olga.
She's marvelous.

21:15.757 --> 21:20.091
- Isn't that divine? Jungle Red.
- Looks as if you've torn someone's throat.

21:20.162 --> 21:22.687
I'll be darned
if I'll let you ride me anymore.

21:22.764 --> 21:24.595
Nancy is only trying to be clever.

21:24.666 --> 21:27.134
She picks on everything about me.
Even my nails.

21:27.202 --> 21:31.696
I like them. I really do. Sydney's,
Olga, Jungle Red. I'll remember.

21:34.409 --> 21:39.005
I woke up this morning and decided,
for no reason, to have myself overhauled.

21:39.881 --> 21:43.339
But why, darling?
Stephen adores you just as you are.

21:45.487 --> 21:48.149
Why do you think I'm getting
overhauled for Stephen?

21:48.223 --> 21:51.488
- You are, aren't you?
- Of course.

21:51.927 --> 21:54.555
I called for an appointment.
I'm Mrs. Fowler's friend.

21:54.629 --> 21:57.291
- Anyone in particular?
- Who does Mrs. Fowler's nails?

21:57.366 --> 21:58.958
Olga. I'll see if she's free.

21:59.034 --> 22:01.195
My Johnny doesn't like
Sylvia's Jungle Red.

22:01.269 --> 22:04.864
He said he'd like to do her nails right down
to the wrist with a buzz saw.

22:04.940 --> 22:08.432
He's intolerant.
Sylvia is all right, underneath.

22:08.910 --> 22:11.879
Summer Rain.
This is the most divine new perfume.

22:12.314 --> 22:15.545
Yes, I have some.
Stephen gave me a bottle for my birthday.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.879
- I think Stephen's awfully sweet.
- Sweet?

22:19.321 --> 22:24.020
He gave you those gorgeous clips,
then he bothered to get you perfume, too.

22:24.092 --> 22:27.152
- Olga's ready, madam.
- Thank you. See you at the Ritz at 1:00.

22:27.229 --> 22:29.424
Take this with you.
It will keep you company.

22:29.498 --> 22:31.329
- Right up here, madam.
- 'Bye.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.562
Good morning, madam. Are you the one?

22:35.637 --> 22:39.232
I love to get a new client.
It puts a girl on her mettle.

22:39.408 --> 22:43.674
Don't you just love to read?
How do they think up those plots?

22:43.779 --> 22:48.375
Don't soak it yet. I suppose anybody's life
would be a plot if it had an exciting finish.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.975
- Who sent you in here?
- Mrs. Fowler.

22:51.153 --> 22:54.645
Isn't she a lamb?
She sent me three clients this week.

22:54.756 --> 22:55.745
Know Mrs. Parrish?

22:55.824 --> 22:59.590
She told me that Mr. Parrish came home
one night with lipstick on his collar.

22:59.661 --> 23:01.390
He always explained everything before.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.227
But that was something
he wasn't going to try to explain.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.267
Soak it, please. Know Mrs. Potter?

23:06.334 --> 23:09.132
I did her at her apartment.
It looks like a reform school.

23:09.204 --> 23:12.298
Her seven daughters are total gangsters.
Know Mrs. Stephen Haines?

23:12.374 --> 23:13.363
Why, yes. l...

23:13.442 --> 23:17.139
I guess Mrs. Fowler told you about that.
She feels awful sorry for her.

23:17.579 --> 23:18.910
I don't.

23:18.980 --> 23:22.541
- You would if you knew this girl.
- What girl?

23:22.651 --> 23:24.278
Crystal Allen.

23:24.853 --> 23:27.321
Yes. You know,
the girl who hooked Mr. Haines.

23:27.389 --> 23:29.289
Don't you like the file?

23:29.357 --> 23:33.953
This Crystal Allen is a friend of mine.
She's a terrible mantrap. Soak it, please.

23:34.029 --> 23:37.988
She's behind the perfume counter
at Black's. So was I, before I got fired.

23:38.066 --> 23:40.398
Left. That's how she met him.

23:41.369 --> 23:42.768
Met Stephen Haines?

23:43.004 --> 23:46.064
It was a couple of months ago.
Us girls wasn't busy.

23:46.141 --> 23:47.938
It was an awful rainy day.

23:48.343 --> 23:51.801
This gentleman walks up to the counter.
Crystal nabs him.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.643
<i>''I</i> want some <i>perfume,''</i> he says.

23:53.715 --> 23:56.149
''May I ask what type of woman for? <i>''</i>
Crystal says.

23:56.218 --> 24:00.154
That didn't mean a thing. She was going
to sell him Summer Rain, our feature.

24:00.222 --> 24:03.020
Crystal goes on conning him,
and batting her eyes.

24:03.358 --> 24:07.260
She's got those eyes that
run up and down a man like a searchlight.

24:07.329 --> 24:11.060
She puts perfume in her palm and in
the crook of her arm for him to smell.

24:11.133 --> 24:13.931
He got to smelling around,
and I guess he liked it.

24:14.002 --> 24:17.369
Since then, they've been inseparable,
practically every evening.

24:17.439 --> 24:21.136
Did I hurt? Jungle Red, I suppose?
One coat, or two?

24:23.478 --> 24:24.467
Never mind.

24:26.448 --> 24:30.145
But I thought that's what you came in for?
All of Mrs. Fowler's friends...

24:30.218 --> 24:33.278
I think I got
what all Mrs. Fowler's friends come for.

24:33.355 --> 24:37.223
Thanks. Goodbye.
I'll tell her you were in, <i>Mrs...</i>

24:37.993 --> 24:39.221
Mrs. Stephen Haines.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.799
Mrs. Haines, I'm sorry.
Is there something I can do?

24:49.538 --> 24:52.473
- Just stop telling that story.
- Sure, I will.

24:53.775 --> 24:58.337
- Please don't tell anyone you told it to me.
- I won't. I promise.

24:58.747 --> 25:03.241
That would be kind of humiliating for you.
I mean, Crystal's a terrible girl.

25:03.318 --> 25:06.549
She's terribly clever and terribly pretty,
Mrs. Haines.

25:06.621 --> 25:10.352
If I was you, I wouldn't waste time
trying to get Mr. Haines away from her.

25:10.425 --> 25:13.155
I mean, now you know, Mrs. Haines.

25:20.502 --> 25:25.405
- Mrs. Haines, your mother is here.
- Thank you, Jane. Tell her I'll be right out.

25:25.473 --> 25:26.940
Yes, ma'am.

25:31.913 --> 25:33.437
- Hello, dear!
- Hello, Mother.

25:33.515 --> 25:36.780
What lovely <i>rubrum!</i>

25:36.851 --> 25:39.285
- What will you wear this evening?
- My old black.

25:39.354 --> 25:40.787
Yes, ma'am.

25:41.723 --> 25:44.817
- No, I think I'll wear my new pink.
- Very well.

25:48.330 --> 25:51.925
What's on your mind? You sounded
so excited on the telephone just now.

25:52.300 --> 25:57.704
I think I was, my dear. Jungle Red.
I've been to Sydney's this afternoon, too.

26:00.775 --> 26:04.267
- Did you have Olga?
- No, but Olga knew who I was.

26:04.379 --> 26:09.180
She asked to meet me. She's very upset
about the story she blurted out to you.

26:10.085 --> 26:13.020
- She didn't say it wasn't true, did she?
- No.

26:18.960 --> 26:22.623
I knew this sort of thing happened
to other people, but <i>I...</i>

26:22.697 --> 26:25.359
I never dreamed it could happen to us.

26:25.600 --> 26:29.195
We've been so happy together.
So really happy.

26:29.404 --> 26:30.632
I know.

26:32.307 --> 26:33.706
There, there, baby.

26:39.914 --> 26:41.541
Have you got one?

26:48.290 --> 26:49.780
I'll be all right now.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.486
You haven't said anything
to Stephen yet, have you?

26:52.560 --> 26:55.654
- No. I haven't even seen him since...
- Then say nothing.

26:55.730 --> 26:57.630
Don't forget that's my handkerchief.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.862
- Shall I give this a touch with the iron?
- Yes. Thank you, Jane.

27:00.935 --> 27:02.926
Look, Mother. Rather sweet, isn't it?

27:03.004 --> 27:05.973
Charming. And very wise of you
to wear pink.

27:09.878 --> 27:12.312
You didn't really mean
that I should say nothing?

27:12.380 --> 27:14.712
- Of course I do.
- But, Mother...

27:14.783 --> 27:16.648
I felt the same way 20 years ago.

27:19.254 --> 27:20.653
Not Father!

27:22.791 --> 27:27.023
In many ways, your father was
an exceptional man, but that wasn't one.

27:27.395 --> 27:30.922
- And you said nothing?
- Nothing. I had a wise mother, too.

27:30.999 --> 27:34.628
Listen, my dear. This story isn't new.
It comes to most wives.

27:34.869 --> 27:36.166
But Stephen...

27:36.237 --> 27:39.502
Stephen is a man.
He's been married 10 years.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.470
You mean he's tired of me?

27:41.543 --> 27:45.445
Stephen's tired of himself,
tired of feeling the same things in himself.

27:45.513 --> 27:47.913
Time comes when a man
has to feel something new.

27:47.982 --> 27:51.418
And he's got to feel young again,
just because he's growing old.

27:51.486 --> 27:53.750
- Mother, Stephen isn't old.
- Of course not.

27:53.822 --> 27:55.790
But we women are much more sensible.

27:55.857 --> 27:59.725
When we tire of ourselves,
we change our hair, or hire a new cook...

27:59.794 --> 28:01.785
...or decorate the house.

28:01.930 --> 28:06.128
I suppose a man could do over his office,
but he never thinks of anything so simple.

28:06.301 --> 28:09.532
No, dear. A man has only one escape
from his old self.

28:09.604 --> 28:12.664
To see a different self
in the mirror of some woman's eyes.

28:14.008 --> 28:17.466
The girl probably means no more to him
than that new dress means to you.

28:17.545 --> 28:19.103
But, Mother...

28:19.280 --> 28:23.740
He doesn't love the girl. If he did,
you'd have felt it yourself long ago.

28:26.488 --> 28:31.221
Yes, I always thought I would.
I love him so much.

28:31.393 --> 28:35.591
And he loves you, baby.
So take my advice. Keep still.

28:35.663 --> 28:38.632
Keep still when you're fairly aching to talk.

28:38.767 --> 28:43.261
It's about the only sacrifice spoiled women
like us ever have to make to keep our men.

28:43.338 --> 28:46.705
- What if I don't want him on those terms?
- But, Mary...

28:46.775 --> 28:50.108
Mother, it's all right for you
to talk of another generation...

28:50.178 --> 28:53.670
...when women were chattels,
and they did as men told them to.

28:53.748 --> 28:57.240
But this is today.
Stephen and I are equals.

28:57.852 --> 29:02.949
We took each other of our own free will,
for life, because we loved each other.

29:03.691 --> 29:07.991
We've always given each other our best.
I won't qualify that relationship now.

29:08.062 --> 29:10.087
It's wrong. Shockingly wrong!

29:10.165 --> 29:13.464
And women that stand for such things
are beneath contempt.

29:13.535 --> 29:15.366
I'll never be one of them! Never!

29:15.437 --> 29:18.372
- But, Mary...
- It's all over. It's finished. I'm through.

29:18.573 --> 29:21.440
No, it isn't. It will never be finished
while you love him.

29:21.776 --> 29:24.643
I'll get over that. Women do.
They have to.

29:26.881 --> 29:28.644
What are you doing this evening?

29:30.718 --> 29:32.982
We're dining at home
and going to the theater.

29:33.054 --> 29:37.286
I've asked Beth and Dave.
I'll go through with it.

29:38.259 --> 29:41.456
I'll have it out with him after.
I'll tell him that I can't go on.

29:41.529 --> 29:46.057
You're not to say a word to Stephen
until you've thought this out very calmly.

29:46.134 --> 29:48.864
I'm going this minute to get our tickets.

29:48.937 --> 29:51.167
You're taking me to Bermuda.
My throat's bad.

29:51.239 --> 29:54.367
I didn't want to worry you,
but my doctor says...

29:54.442 --> 29:56.205
How sweet of you.

29:58.580 --> 30:01.208
But what can there be between us now?

30:01.583 --> 30:04.984
The thing that made us
belong to each other is gone.

30:05.520 --> 30:10.355
There's something more for you to think of
besides each other. There's your daughter.

30:14.496 --> 30:18.125
When Mary's old enough to realize,
she'll know I'm right.

30:18.366 --> 30:23.360
Have it your own way, but don't forget,
it's being together at the end that matters.

30:24.706 --> 30:28.904
One more piece of motherly advice.
Don't confide in your girlfriends.

30:29.878 --> 30:31.778
I think they all know.

30:31.846 --> 30:34.076
- Do they think you know?
- I don't know.

30:34.148 --> 30:35.445
Leave it that way.

30:35.517 --> 30:38.543
If you let them, they'll see that,
in the name of friendship...

30:38.620 --> 30:40.747
...you lose your husband and your home.

30:40.822 --> 30:44.383
I'm an old woman, my dear.
I know my sex. Goodbye.

30:47.128 --> 30:51.030
Goodbye, darling,
and thanks for coming up.

30:52.166 --> 30:54.657
It's nice to have you need Mother again.

30:54.736 --> 30:57.204
You'd better think it over, dear,
about Bermuda.

30:57.272 --> 31:01.572
Your home, Little Mary's home
is worth putting up a stiff battle for.

31:02.477 --> 31:04.707
There's nothing like a good dose
of being alone...

31:04.779 --> 31:06.940
...to make a man appreciate his wife.

31:07.015 --> 31:09.677
I think I better take my handkerchief.

31:22.764 --> 31:24.459
Hello, Stephen.

31:27.936 --> 31:29.028
Yes.

31:32.740 --> 31:34.367
You can't?

31:38.446 --> 31:39.845
I see.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.917
No, I'm not angry.

31:44.953 --> 31:48.912
Beth and Dave will be disappointed
not to see you, that's all.

31:50.925 --> 31:53.086
No, I won't wait up.

31:57.865 --> 32:01.392
I think I'll take Mother to Bermuda
for a few weeks.

32:01.636 --> 32:05.333
She was just here
and she doesn't seem to be feeling well.

32:07.275 --> 32:09.903
On the first boat, if you don't mind.

32:18.720 --> 32:23.282
Don't break your appointment, dear,
if it's going to upset your business.

32:24.092 --> 32:27.858
But if you find that you can go tonight,
just call me back.

32:30.031 --> 32:34.195
You needn't dress, and it doesn't matter
if you're late for dinner.

32:35.637 --> 32:37.002
Goodbye.

32:55.256 --> 32:59.659
- Here we are. Creeping up on her.
- Do you think we ought to do this?

32:59.727 --> 33:00.921
Shut up.

33:04.766 --> 33:07.030
- That's little Crystal.
- None other.

33:08.670 --> 33:10.501
May I serve you, madam?

33:10.571 --> 33:13.062
- No, thank you.
- We're just looking.

33:13.207 --> 33:17.769
From the neck up, I'd say no.
How about Baby?

33:17.879 --> 33:19.210
Of course.

33:21.683 --> 33:23.150
It couldn't be anyone else.

33:23.217 --> 33:25.117
Pat, here's your customer's change.

33:25.186 --> 33:26.710
- Pat.
- May I wait on you?

33:26.788 --> 33:29.621
I still don't know why he overlooked her.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.653
I do. Pipe.

33:41.369 --> 33:43.963
Never mind. This has got to go out now.
Wrap it up.

33:44.038 --> 33:47.132
- Were you asking for me, Miss Allen?
- I've been looking for you.

33:47.208 --> 33:48.971
I want you to cook dinner.

33:49.043 --> 33:52.535
- I got a date tonight, Miss Crystal.
- You can break it. Come on.

33:52.613 --> 33:55.275
I'm noted for the bad way I cook.

33:55.349 --> 33:59.012
If you throw a lamb chop in a hot oven,
what will keep it from getting done?

33:59.087 --> 34:01.715
What happened to that hot date
you had for tonight?

34:01.789 --> 34:05.589
It's hotter than ever, dear.
I'm having him dine at my place.

34:05.660 --> 34:08.527
It's about time he found out
I was a home girl.

34:08.596 --> 34:12.464
Home girl? Get her. Why don't you
borrow the quintuplets for an evening?

34:12.533 --> 34:14.558
Because I'm all the baby he wants.

34:14.635 --> 34:17.001
- How much will you pay me?
- $2.

34:17.237 --> 34:19.536
- Can't you make it $3?
- I said $2.

34:19.607 --> 34:23.304
All right. Will I find anything
in your icebox?

34:23.377 --> 34:25.139
Cobwebs and a bottle of gin.

34:25.213 --> 34:27.806
Here's some dough.
Get anything, and make it fast.

34:27.882 --> 34:30.783
Perfume Department. It's for you, Crystal.

34:30.851 --> 34:33.946
It's too late to take any orders.
Tell them I've left the floor.

34:34.021 --> 34:38.481
- All right. I'll tell the gentleman.
- Gentleman? Why didn't you say so?

34:42.496 --> 34:44.487
Hello, Stephen.

34:46.434 --> 34:47.594
What?

34:49.203 --> 34:52.934
Don't worry, my sweet.

34:53.775 --> 34:56.902
Of course I don't mind
your breaking our engagement.

34:56.978 --> 35:01.278
That is, I mind, of course,
but it's such good discipline...

35:01.349 --> 35:03.442
...for my selfishness about you.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.544
- Holy mackerel! What a line!
- Shut up, will you?

35:08.589 --> 35:11.786
I was going to surprise you tonight...

35:11.859 --> 35:15.090
...and cook dinner myself
in my little apartment.

35:16.931 --> 35:19.024
Why, of course I can cook.

35:19.100 --> 35:22.627
She thinks because Lulu's dark,
he won't be able to see her.

35:22.703 --> 35:25.638
You don't know half my accomplishments.

35:25.706 --> 35:28.834
- I'll say, he doesn't.
- Will you get out of here?

35:30.044 --> 35:32.410
That's all right, Stephen.

35:32.480 --> 35:36.211
I'll save you a piece of the cake
with a candle on it.

35:40.755 --> 35:42.814
I didn't tell you before...

35:42.890 --> 35:46.587
...because I was afraid
you might do something extravagant.

35:48.529 --> 35:52.659
It is dear of you to want to be with me
on my birthday...

35:52.733 --> 35:54.701
...but I won't be lonely.

35:55.469 --> 35:57.596
Honestly, I won't.

35:58.272 --> 36:02.470
And if this weather lets up,
my neuralgia will be better.

36:02.543 --> 36:04.408
Then maybe I <i>can...</i>

36:05.046 --> 36:08.140
No, it's nothing. It's just nerves.

36:11.652 --> 36:14.917
I had a rather gloomy letter
from home today.

36:15.156 --> 36:17.147
My little sister, she's not very well.

36:17.225 --> 36:19.386
What's wrong with her?
She got a hangover?

36:19.460 --> 36:24.420
But she'll be all right.
Yes, I'm holding the thought.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.331
No, Stephen.

36:29.737 --> 36:33.639
I couldn't think of you
disarranging your evening.

36:33.708 --> 36:35.972
I'll have another birthday next year.

36:36.043 --> 36:40.480
- You'll have another one next week.
- So help me, I'm going to slug you.

36:43.718 --> 36:46.744
If you could drop by
for just a few moments...

36:46.821 --> 36:49.654
...and have a glass of sherry to my health.

36:52.660 --> 36:55.288
I do need you so.

36:57.365 --> 36:59.026
Yes, dear.

37:00.534 --> 37:03.992
I'll meet you on our corner in five minutes.

37:04.605 --> 37:05.970
Goodbye.

37:07.341 --> 37:11.675
Say, can you beat him?
He almost stood me up for his wife.

37:12.079 --> 37:16.243
- Two late shoppers waiting for you.
- You can have them. I've got to hustle.

37:16.317 --> 37:19.582
But they asked for you by name.
Miss Crystal Allen.

37:20.855 --> 37:23.085
- Why me?
- Maybe they're slumming.

37:26.060 --> 37:28.119
Might I be of assistance?

37:29.931 --> 37:33.196
Yes. I'm thinking of changing my perfume.

37:34.402 --> 37:36.597
Something more subtle,
or something in the woodsy order?

37:36.671 --> 37:38.536
This, for instance.

37:39.407 --> 37:43.605
- Is that what you use?
- That's much too expensive for me.

37:45.446 --> 37:50.440
Nonsense, my dear. A pretty girl like you,
with all the rich men that float in here.

37:50.518 --> 37:54.215
I'm afraid, when they come to this counter,
they are thinking of other women.

37:54.889 --> 37:57.881
I shouldn't think you'd let that disturb you.

38:00.394 --> 38:02.555
Here's this new one, Summer Rain.

38:02.630 --> 38:05.030
That's the kind Mary Haines
is so keen about.

38:05.199 --> 38:06.962
Yes, that's it.

38:07.368 --> 38:11.327
A friend of ours, Mrs. Stephen Haines,
simply dotes on this.

38:11.605 --> 38:12.594
Really?

38:12.673 --> 38:15.574
Her husband picked it out for her.
Perhaps you sold it to him.

38:15.643 --> 38:17.804
Stephen Haines, the engineer?

38:18.546 --> 38:22.380
I'm afraid I don't remember.
We have so many men come in here.

38:23.217 --> 38:26.084
Awfully good looking.
Tall, fair, distinguished.

38:26.153 --> 38:27.745
You wouldn't overlook him.

38:28.222 --> 38:31.885
I'm sorry, but when one's mind
is on one's own <i>business...</i>

38:33.127 --> 38:37.621
Of course. And as you say,
you have so many <i>men...</i>

38:41.002 --> 38:45.939
I wouldn't think that one suggested
your personality at all. It's called Oomph.

38:48.943 --> 38:52.140
- How amusing.
- What's that?

38:52.813 --> 38:53.802
Closing time.

38:54.548 --> 38:56.641
The bum's rush in melody, dear.

38:58.753 --> 39:01.449
- Good night, Pat.
- Good night, Crystal.

39:02.423 --> 39:05.824
- I'm afraid we're keeping you.
- That's quite all right.

39:06.327 --> 39:10.787
I'll take this. Charge it and send.
Here's my name and address.

39:11.832 --> 39:15.700
25 cents. You are getting off
economically, aren't you?

39:16.203 --> 39:17.465
Aren't I?

39:19.340 --> 39:21.365
lt'll be out tomorrow, Mrs. Prowler.

39:23.277 --> 39:26.508
- Fowler!
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Fowler.

39:27.081 --> 39:30.744
The impertinent upstart.
I won't let her get away with that.

39:30.818 --> 39:34.481
You weren't exactly any Pollyanna yourself.
No wonder she caught on.

39:34.555 --> 39:37.353
''Prowler.'' She's laughing at us.
I can see from here.

39:37.425 --> 39:39.950
- I believe she is.
- She called me that deliberately.

39:40.027 --> 39:42.518
I'll have her fired.
I'll go to management right now.

39:42.596 --> 39:44.496
I'll go with you.

40:01.849 --> 40:04.283
You never told me you could do that.

40:04.351 --> 40:07.582
I can do a lot of things
you don't know about.

40:08.589 --> 40:10.420
Bermuda's finest railway.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.255
- Did you like to ride on that thing?
- We had to like it.

40:13.327 --> 40:17.423
There wasn't a single automobile
in Bermuda. Those were our taxis.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.989
Now you'll see your grandmother
ride a bicycle.

40:20.067 --> 40:23.036
- Grandma, you can't ride a bicycle.
- Can't I? Here I come.

40:23.104 --> 40:25.197
Grandma, you're a riot!

40:26.407 --> 40:28.466
Riot? I was a catastrophe.

40:28.542 --> 40:32.069
- How did you ever get out of it?
- Your mother brushed me up in a dustpan.

40:33.147 --> 40:36.014
- What have you got on there?
- Watch and see.

40:36.550 --> 40:39.383
- He's giving you a run for your money.
- There!

40:39.954 --> 40:43.082
- That fish is dead as a doornail, Mother.
- What?

40:43.290 --> 40:45.656
- He wouldn't fool anybody.
- No harm in trying.

40:45.726 --> 40:48.194
Watch. This is where the camera
goes overboard.

40:48.262 --> 40:50.526
Did you drop our precious camera
in the water?

40:50.598 --> 40:54.830
Your precious grandma dropped in after it
straight to the bottom of the ocean.

40:55.436 --> 40:59.167
Not quite to the bottom.
I know I saw whales on my way up.

41:00.474 --> 41:05.104
- Weren't you having a good time that day?
- I was getting homesick for you.

41:05.846 --> 41:08.406
Until your grandmother broke it up.

41:08.949 --> 41:13.477
You're pretty in that picture, Mother,
with the book in front of your face.

41:14.855 --> 41:16.220
The show is over.

41:17.691 --> 41:20.785
- Homesick for me or for Daddy?
- For Sheba.

41:21.662 --> 41:25.496
If Sheba would have been along,
you would have stayed the full four weeks?

41:25.566 --> 41:27.625
- Of course.
- Your music teacher is here.

41:27.701 --> 41:31.330
Thanks. Don't put the machine away yet.
I want to run them for Daddy.

41:31.405 --> 41:33.066
I ran them for him last night.

41:33.140 --> 41:37.008
I bet he wished he was there
when he saw you catch that fish.

41:37.578 --> 41:41.639
- Yes, I bet he did.
- We missed you so while you were gone.

41:42.716 --> 41:45.207
- Daddy and I.
- Did you?

41:45.286 --> 41:48.221
Yes. He finally had to take me to the zoo
to cheer me up.

41:48.289 --> 41:52.385
- A fine compliment to me.
- I didn't mean it that way, Mother.

41:52.626 --> 41:56.790
You're better than all the lions,
tigers and elephants in the whole world.

41:56.864 --> 42:00.527
- Bless you.
- I saw Mrs. Potter at the zoo that day.

42:00.601 --> 42:03.365
Who was she visiting with? The snakes?

42:03.437 --> 42:05.302
Actually she was.

42:05.739 --> 42:09.903
Mrs. Potter said she and Auntie Sylvia
would call you up that evening in Bermuda.

42:09.977 --> 42:13.674
- You didn't tell me they called you up.
- Didn't I?

42:14.181 --> 42:16.411
They hadn't said anything worth reporting.

42:16.483 --> 42:20.613
<i>- Mademoiselle</i> is waiting, Mary.
- Bother. Goodbye, Grandma.

42:20.955 --> 42:24.288
I'll give you a lesson some day
with the camera.

42:24.725 --> 42:27.956
Mary, is that why
we hurried home ahead of time?

42:28.529 --> 42:29.655
Why, we hurried?

42:29.730 --> 42:33.188
Was it something those women said
to you when they called you up?

42:33.267 --> 42:38.227
Of course not. You're so suspicious.
I'm happy we came home when we did.

42:39.907 --> 42:43.399
Stephen has spent every evening with me
since I got back.

42:43.477 --> 42:46.537
- Are you really happy, dear?
- Divinely.

42:49.283 --> 42:51.148
Look me in the eye.

42:51.752 --> 42:55.210
- Now say it again.
- I'm divinely happy.

42:58.125 --> 43:01.561
Mrs. Potter called. She said
she'd see you at the fashion show.

43:01.629 --> 43:03.927
Will you put those things away?

43:03.998 --> 43:06.432
Come along this afternoon
and watch me splurge.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.298
And listen to Edith Potter?
I'd sooner have the itch.

43:09.370 --> 43:11.770
I'm afraid you don't
humor my friends enough.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.865
It's humoring some of them
not to cut their throats.

43:14.942 --> 43:18.969
Now that you're home again, promise me
that you'll stay in your own ivory tower...

43:19.046 --> 43:21.879
...and be very noncommittal
about yourself and Stephen.

43:21.949 --> 43:24.679
- They won't get a thing out of me.
- Good.

43:24.752 --> 43:26.515
Any more advice to the lovelorn?

43:26.587 --> 43:29.852
You mustn't kid Mother, dear.
I was married before you were born.

43:37.931 --> 43:40.195
Mary, have one of these. They're delicious.

43:40.267 --> 43:42.758
Edith, don't tempt me.
I lost pounds in Bermuda.

43:43.404 --> 43:46.168
You are thin, darling.
I hope it's not from worry.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.504
No. The tropics are swell for the figure.

43:48.575 --> 43:51.669
- What did you wear there?
- Slacks, mostly. I got very sloppy.

43:51.745 --> 43:54.077
One always does, traveling alone.

43:54.415 --> 43:56.906
You ought to load up on clothes
for Stephen, dear.

43:56.984 --> 43:59.953
- Is he taking you out much?
- Yes, lots.

44:00.154 --> 44:03.248
- Come on, girls. Let's sit down.
- She can't take it.

44:04.091 --> 44:06.992
<i>Bonjour, Mesdames, Mesdemoiselles.</i>

44:07.394 --> 44:09.658
It gives me pleasure to be your cicerone...

44:09.730 --> 44:12.665
...on our adventurous little voyage
into Fashionland.

44:12.733 --> 44:15.998
But today, ladies, as an innovation,
you'll see the models...

44:16.070 --> 44:18.664
...go through the rhythmic movement
of everyday life.

44:18.739 --> 44:21.299
You'll be able to study the flow
of the new line...

44:21.375 --> 44:25.812
...as it responds to the ever-changing flow
of the female form divine.

44:26.347 --> 44:29.248
<i>Et maintenant,</i>
a little peep into the coming season.

44:29.783 --> 44:32.183
And a glimpse of the future, too.

44:32.586 --> 44:34.520
<i>Lumiere. Musique.</i>

50:19.966 --> 50:22.025
Princess Mara, show here, please.

50:24.471 --> 50:26.268
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.

50:26.707 --> 50:29.369
You should have it, Mary.
You're just what it needs.

50:29.443 --> 50:32.810
It was Mrs. Potter who asked
for the dress, Princess.

50:33.080 --> 50:35.981
- I'm sorry.
- You'd sell a woman anything.

50:36.049 --> 50:39.246
Come here. Why don't you wear it right?
The cape goes up here.

50:39.319 --> 50:41.719
Stop mauling me.
What do you know about clothes?

50:41.788 --> 50:44.780
I'm not a model,
but nobody disputes how I wear clothes.

50:44.858 --> 50:46.416
You better apologize.

50:46.493 --> 50:48.927
It's professional jealousy.
They're good friends.

50:48.995 --> 50:52.362
Yes. She adores the Fowler family.
Particularly my husband.

50:52.466 --> 50:54.661
Are you accusing me
of flirting with Howard?

50:54.735 --> 50:58.432
No, but of trying to. I'd like to see
Howard bat an eye at another woman.

50:58.505 --> 51:00.939
I've seen him, and she's not bad either.

51:01.007 --> 51:03.373
- You little...
- Come on, Sylvia.

51:03.443 --> 51:05.411
Did you get her innuendo?

51:05.479 --> 51:08.607
I've always hated that creature.
The way she exploits her title.

51:08.682 --> 51:10.980
The one thing I'm sure of
is Howard Fowler.

51:11.051 --> 51:13.781
- How do you do, Mrs. Fowler?
- Hello, my dear. Hey, you.

51:13.854 --> 51:15.583
I don't like that.

51:16.089 --> 51:18.523
Howard wants me to go on a world cruise.

51:18.592 --> 51:21.220
- Isn't that adorable?
- It's divine!

51:21.294 --> 51:24.559
- Don't tell me, but how much is it?
- $225.

51:24.631 --> 51:26.462
- It is a nightgown, isn't it?
- Yes.

51:26.733 --> 51:30.066
- I'd be glad to wear it for an evening gown.
- Isn't she naive?

51:30.137 --> 51:31.832
Mary, you have to have it.

51:31.905 --> 51:34.931
If Stephen doesn't notice the nightgown,
he'll notice the bill.

51:35.008 --> 51:37.476
- Okay. I'll take it.
- I'll take that.

51:39.179 --> 51:43.946
I could use a few more gowns.
Imports with hand embroidery.

51:45.285 --> 51:47.753
- I'll get it back for you.
- Please don't bother.

51:47.821 --> 51:51.587
- Mary, how humiliating.
- I could die for you.

51:51.758 --> 51:54.852
What's the matter? I don't want it.
It's too expensive anyway.

51:54.928 --> 51:57.089
- You don't know who she is?
- No. Who?

51:57.164 --> 51:58.995
That's Crystal Allen.

52:05.038 --> 52:06.801
Yes, it's very nice.

52:08.475 --> 52:09.874
I'll take that, too.

52:10.110 --> 52:11.304
Pretty, isn't she?

52:11.378 --> 52:15.337
But did you hear the brazen thing?
At $225, she could use a few more.

52:15.415 --> 52:19.909
- You won't stand by and let that...
- Sorry, girls. It's time for my fitting.

52:31.198 --> 52:34.964
I've been saving a good room for you,
Mrs. Haines. Right this way.

52:35.035 --> 52:37.902
I'll have your fitting sent down directly.

52:43.877 --> 52:46.311
- Right in here, please.
- Thank you.

52:51.918 --> 52:56.446
Our new one-piece foundation garment.
Zips up the back, and no bone.

52:57.624 --> 53:02.118
Our new one-piece foundation garment.
Zips up the back, and no bone.

53:03.797 --> 53:08.234
Our new one-piece foundation garment.
Zips up the back, and no bone.

53:08.435 --> 53:10.369
- Will you open a charge?
- Yes, please.

53:10.437 --> 53:13.964
- May I have the name?
- Crystal Allen, the Hotel Viceroy.

53:14.140 --> 53:17.507
May I have your other charges?
Saks? Bergdorf? Cartier?

53:17.577 --> 53:21.013
- I'll be opening those in a few days.
- Then, may I have your bank?

53:21.081 --> 53:23.413
I've no checking account either,
at the moment.

53:23.483 --> 53:26.043
I'm sorry, but we must have
one business reference.

53:26.119 --> 53:31.113
Certainly. Mr. Stephen Haines.
He's a very old friend of my family.

53:31.691 --> 53:35.218
That will do.
Mrs. Haines is a very good client of ours.

53:38.098 --> 53:41.590
- By the way, I've never met Mrs. Haines.
- She's a dear.

53:41.768 --> 53:46.762
Yes, I'm sure, so I'd rather you didn't say
that I gave her husband as a reference.

53:47.407 --> 53:49.739
- Do you mind?
- Of course not, Miss Allen.

53:49.809 --> 53:52.835
- Thank you.
- We understand.

53:52.979 --> 53:56.005
- What do you mean, you understand?
- I mean...

53:56.082 --> 53:58.209
- Never mind.
- I hope you don't think l...

53:58.285 --> 53:59.843
No, it's quite all right.

54:01.288 --> 54:05.088
It's so dreadful living in a strange city
all alone.

54:05.158 --> 54:09.322
You have to be so careful not to do
anything people might misconstrue.

54:09.396 --> 54:11.387
I don't know Mrs. Haines yet...

54:11.464 --> 54:15.093
...and I'd hate to get off on the wrong foot
before I met her socially.

54:15.168 --> 54:18.228
Naturally. Women are funny
about little things like that.

54:18.305 --> 54:21.138
Wait. You know that blue <i>jersey...</i>
Unzip me, will you?

54:21.207 --> 54:24.108
That blue jersey you had
all drippy with embroidery?

54:24.177 --> 54:25.269
The blue negligee?

54:25.345 --> 54:27.210
- Will you bring that in?
- Certainly.

54:28.515 --> 54:32.542
- That really suits you, Mrs. Haines.
- Yes. It is nice, isn't it?

54:32.886 --> 54:35.753
- Is there something wrong?
- No. It's really charming.

54:35.822 --> 54:38.188
- May I come in?
- I'll get your hat, Mrs. Haines.

54:38.258 --> 54:39.623
Sit down, Sylvia.

54:39.893 --> 54:44.262
- Why don't you confide in me?
- Will you please stay out of my affairs?

54:44.331 --> 54:48.961
I won't. If you think I'll let you hide
your head in the sand, you're mistaken.

54:49.035 --> 54:52.004
You're the only one in New York
that doesn't know all about it.

54:52.072 --> 54:56.065
Howard says that Stephen
hasn't been seen in the club for weeks.

54:57.610 --> 54:59.441
Go away.

54:59.512 --> 55:03.608
Show that model to Miss Allen, there.
Your hat, Mrs. Haines.

55:06.720 --> 55:10.816
- Is that Crystal Allen across the hall?
- Yes, she's a new customer.

55:10.890 --> 55:11.982
Do you know her?

55:12.058 --> 55:15.357
- Has she a lot of money?
- She knows where to get a lot.

55:15.428 --> 55:18.090
She's buying everything she sees,
regardless.

55:18.164 --> 55:21.065
- Mrs. Haines, are you ill?
- No, just tired.

55:21.134 --> 55:22.795
You've been standing too long.

55:22.869 --> 55:25.337
- Go get her a glass of sherry.
- Surely.

55:26.006 --> 55:30.340
You'd feel so much better
if you talked this out with someone.

55:30.477 --> 55:33.310
Stephen's a worm,
spending money on a girl like that.

55:33.380 --> 55:34.711
Shut up.

55:34.948 --> 55:38.645
Do you like being made ridiculous
before all your friends? Don't be a fool.

55:38.718 --> 55:41.983
- Go in there.
- Go in there? I'm going home.

55:45.158 --> 55:47.854
Now's your chance to go there
and put an end to this.

55:47.927 --> 55:49.895
Go in and say a few quiet words.

55:49.963 --> 55:53.194
Tell her you'll make Stephen's life
a tornado until he gives her up.

55:53.266 --> 55:55.894
Look where she was six months ago
and where she's now.

55:55.969 --> 55:59.666
Will you please let me do what I want to
with my own life?

56:02.542 --> 56:05.739
She may be a perfectly marvelous influence
for your husband...

56:05.812 --> 56:08.610
...but she won't do your child any good.

56:10.216 --> 56:11.444
What do you mean?

56:11.518 --> 56:14.510
Far be it from me to tell you things
you don't care to hear.

56:14.587 --> 56:18.648
I've known this all along. Edith wanted me
to tell you when you were in Bermuda.

56:18.725 --> 56:20.386
But did I utter?

56:20.460 --> 56:22.985
What's this got to do with my child?

56:23.229 --> 56:25.595
It was while you were away.
Edith saw them.

56:25.665 --> 56:28.532
Stephen, that creature and Little Mary
lunching in the park.

56:28.601 --> 56:30.626
She said they were having a happy time.

56:30.703 --> 56:34.730
That beezle had her arm around Little Mary
and was kissing her between every bite.

56:34.808 --> 56:38.244
When I heard that,
I was positively heartsick, dear.

56:39.312 --> 56:42.281
But as you say, it's your affair, not mine.

56:42.715 --> 56:46.811
No doubt that girl will make
a fine step-mama for your daughter.

57:03.470 --> 57:04.767
Come in.

57:08.007 --> 57:10.737
- I beg your pardon.
- I am Mrs. Stephen Haines.

57:12.745 --> 57:16.545
- Sorry, but I don't think I know you.
- I believe it's my husband you know.

57:19.619 --> 57:23.020
- Stephen's told you.
- No, he's never mentioned you.

57:23.089 --> 57:25.956
- Here's the blue negligee you ordered.
- Stay out of here!

57:26.025 --> 57:28.585
But I've known about you for some time.

57:28.661 --> 57:32.222
That'll be news to Stephen.
Personally, I'm glad you know.

57:32.298 --> 57:35.665
I've kept still because I knew it wouldn't
take him long to get fed up.

57:35.735 --> 57:38.568
Don't lay any bets on that. I'm not you.

57:38.638 --> 57:41.334
You've been seeing my daughter.
That's why I came in.

57:41.407 --> 57:44.342
- I won't have you around my daughter.
- Don't get hysterical.

57:44.410 --> 57:47.573
What do I care about her?
I'm sick of hearing about her.

57:47.647 --> 57:49.740
You won't have to hear
about her anymore...

57:49.816 --> 57:53.809
...because you and my husband
aren't going on seeing each other.

57:54.020 --> 57:56.818
That's rather up to Stephen,
don't you think?

57:57.290 --> 58:00.521
Completely,
so you better start making other plans.

58:02.795 --> 58:05.229
I'm taking my marching orders
from Stephen.

58:05.665 --> 58:08.532
He seems to be satisfied
with this arrangement.

58:08.601 --> 58:12.799
Don't force any issues unless you want
to cause plenty of trouble.

58:14.407 --> 58:17.433
You've made it impossible for me
to do anything else.

58:17.510 --> 58:20.104
- You're very confident, aren't you?
- Yes.

58:20.180 --> 58:23.206
Because I know Stephen couldn't love
a girl like you.

58:23.283 --> 58:25.911
If he couldn't, he's an awfully good actor.

58:26.653 --> 58:29.247
What have you got to kick about?

58:29.322 --> 58:33.088
You've got everything that matters.
The name, the position, the money.

58:34.194 --> 58:38.062
My husband's love happens to mean
more to me than those things.

58:38.565 --> 58:40.795
Can the sob stuff, Mrs. Haines.

58:40.867 --> 58:44.166
You noble wives and mothers
bore the brains out of me.

58:44.671 --> 58:48.698
- I'll bet you bore your husbands, too.
- You're a hard one, aren't you?

58:48.775 --> 58:51.539
I can be soft on the right occasion.

58:52.612 --> 58:54.807
What did you expect me to do?

58:54.881 --> 58:57.816
Burst into tears,
and beg you to forgive me?

58:58.318 --> 59:00.980
Isn't that what you really came in here for?

59:01.521 --> 59:04.649
Not after seeing you.
You're more typical than I dared hope.

59:04.891 --> 59:08.452
Honey, that goes double. Get this.

59:08.761 --> 59:12.857
I'd break up your snug little roost if I could,
but I don't stand a chance.

59:12.932 --> 59:15.958
Don't think it's because your husband
isn't crazy about me.

59:16.035 --> 59:21.029
It's because he lets old-fashioned
sentiment put the Indian sign on him.

59:21.307 --> 59:24.470
I'm glad you understand the strength
of sentiment, Miss Allen...

59:24.544 --> 59:27.911
...because its beauty is something
you'll never know.

59:31.317 --> 59:34.047
This happens to be my room, Mrs. Haines.

59:34.621 --> 59:38.751
It's yours, yes, for the time being,
like everything else you've got.

59:38.825 --> 59:41.953
May I suggest, if you're dressing
to please Stephen, not that one.

59:42.028 --> 59:44.258
He doesn't like such obvious effects.

59:44.330 --> 59:49.267
Thanks for the tip. But when anything
I wear doesn't please him, I take it off.

59:56.976 --> 59:59.877
That's what she calls
meeting Mrs. Haines socially.

59:59.946 --> 01:00:03.905
- I feel sorry for Mrs. Haines. She's so nice.
- She should've kept her mouth shut.

01:00:03.983 --> 01:00:06.850
- Now she's in the soup.
- Allen's smart.

01:00:06.919 --> 01:00:09.786
She's fixed it so anything Mr. Haines says
will sound wrong.

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:13.087
- She'll get him, sure.
- Look at that chassis. She's got him now.

01:00:13.159 --> 01:00:16.026
You can't trust any man.
That's all they want.

01:00:16.095 --> 01:00:18.325
What else have we got to give?

01:00:19.666 --> 01:00:23.363
Our new one-piece foundation garment.
Zips up the back, and no bone.

01:00:24.404 --> 01:00:27.635
Ready? Up, over, up, down.

01:00:29.242 --> 01:00:30.402
Up, stretch, up, together.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.517
My sympathies are with Mrs. Haines.
They always are with the woman.

01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:46.752
She's been stupid about it.
She walked in and faced the creature.

01:00:46.859 --> 01:00:49.419
I begged her not to,
''Mary, where's your dignity? <i>''</i>

01:00:49.495 --> 01:00:51.827
- My scars!
- Very good for adhesions. Up!

01:00:51.964 --> 01:00:53.989
No more ''up.'' This has got me down.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:56.831
Rest a moment and relax your diaphragm,
if you can.

01:00:56.903 --> 01:01:00.737
If only she'd decide to get a divorce.
It's hard on her friends not knowing.

01:01:00.807 --> 01:01:03.708
- You can't ask them anywhere.
- On your side.

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:05.304
Ready? Up, down.

01:01:05.378 --> 01:01:08.006
For her daughter's sake,
she has to hang on. I would.

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:09.105
Watch your knees!

01:01:09.182 --> 01:01:12.777
She should not have told him.
When a man's into that, he needs time.

01:01:12.852 --> 01:01:13.876
Thigh in!

01:01:13.953 --> 01:01:16.114
- She never listens to us.
- How doesn't she?

01:01:16.189 --> 01:01:20.148
Whatever she wants to do is okay by me.
I've got to be loyal to Mrs. Haines.

01:01:20.226 --> 01:01:23.059
I'm simply exhausted.

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:26.961
Suppose you try something simpler,
like crawling up the wall.

01:01:27.033 --> 01:01:29.092
What I go through to keep my figure.

01:01:29.168 --> 01:01:31.762
Do I see red when some
fat, lazy, dinner partner says:

01:01:31.838 --> 01:01:34.773
''What do you do with yourself
all day, Mrs. Fowler? <i>''</i>

01:01:35.842 --> 01:01:40.040
Arms flat. Crawl slowly up the wall.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.014
They way you say that
makes me feel like vermin.

01:01:43.082 --> 01:01:46.074
That shouldn't take much effort.
I mean crawling up the wall.

01:01:46.152 --> 01:01:48.916
- Hello, Sylvia.
- You're late again, after all I've done.

01:01:50.623 --> 01:01:54.423
Please! Let's begin with posture.

01:01:55.061 --> 01:01:59.555
- A lady always enters a room erect.
- Lots of my friends exit horizontally.

01:02:00.099 --> 01:02:02.397
Knees apart, sit on the wall.

01:02:02.835 --> 01:02:05.770
Relax. Roll slowly up the wall...

01:02:05.838 --> 01:02:08.705
...pressing each vertebrae
as hard as you can.

01:02:08.775 --> 01:02:10.606
Shoulders back. Heads back.

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:13.201
Mrs. Fowler, lift yourself behind the ears.

01:02:13.279 --> 01:02:15.577
Now, chin up, elbows bent.

01:02:15.648 --> 01:02:16.774
Up on your toes.

01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:19.374
Arms out,
shove with the small of your back.

01:02:19.452 --> 01:02:23.286
- John's furious that you're paying.
- He ought to be darn glad he's not.

01:02:23.356 --> 01:02:25.324
You're still giving him your income?

01:02:25.391 --> 01:02:28.053
He's so proud,
he resents taking that tiny amount.

01:02:28.127 --> 01:02:31.255
- He resents it because there isn't more.
- Tuck under, please.

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:34.094
You don't understand,
he's so clever but makes so little.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:38.228
You should hang on to your income.
It's a married woman's only protection.

01:02:38.304 --> 01:02:40.204
Are you as you were
when you left the wall?

01:02:40.273 --> 01:02:42.764
- I am.
- No, Mrs. Fowler, you're not.

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:45.970
Not this, that. Try it, please.

01:02:48.314 --> 01:02:50.646
That's better. Relax on the mat.

01:02:52.919 --> 01:02:54.079
Ready?

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.482
One, two.

01:02:59.926 --> 01:03:02.793
Bend, stretch, you know. Ready?

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:06.525
Bend, stretch, bend, down.
Plenty of pull on the hamstrings, please.

01:03:06.632 --> 01:03:07.997
Sylvia! Hello, Peggy!

01:03:08.067 --> 01:03:10.433
- What are you doing here?
- I'm having a facial.

01:03:10.503 --> 01:03:12.562
Darling, I've done the most awful thing.

01:03:12.638 --> 01:03:14.572
We're in the middle of our exercises.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.337
Go tell them I want my paraffin bath.
I'm simply exhausted.

01:03:18.411 --> 01:03:20.140
You've hardly moved a muscle.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:24.309
- Who's carcass is this, yours or mine?
- It's yours, but I'm paid to exercise it.

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.617
- You talk like a horse trainer.
- You're getting warm!

01:03:28.488 --> 01:03:30.183
- How do you like...
- What?

01:03:30.256 --> 01:03:32.816
Darling, I've just done
the most ghastly thing.

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:34.154
Move over, will you?

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:38.357
It wasn't until I got here during my <i>facial...</i>
I could bite my tongue off...

01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:39.557
Edith, what is it?

01:03:39.632 --> 01:03:41.190
I ate with Dolly Dupuyster...

01:03:41.267 --> 01:03:45.203
You forgot she's writing a gossip column,
and you told her something about me.

01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:46.966
You know I never give you away.

01:03:47.039 --> 01:03:49.599
- I told her about Stephen and Mary.
- Oh, that!

01:03:49.675 --> 01:03:53.634
- It wasn't until I got here...
- It'll be in all the dreadful scandal sheets!

01:03:53.713 --> 01:03:57.615
I know! I've been racking my brains
to try and remember what it was I said.

01:03:57.683 --> 01:04:02.552
I said that Mary went into the fitting room
and yanked the coat off the Allen girl.

01:04:02.622 --> 01:04:03.953
You didn't!

01:04:04.023 --> 01:04:08.551
I don't know if I said ermine or sable coat,
but I said she gave her an awful smack!

01:04:09.295 --> 01:04:10.819
That's what Sylvia told me.

01:04:10.897 --> 01:04:12.296
- I didn't.
- You did, too.

01:04:12.365 --> 01:04:14.959
I didn't expect you'd tell it
to some cheap reporter.

01:04:15.034 --> 01:04:17.559
It doesn't matter.
The divorce is practically settled.

01:04:17.637 --> 01:04:19.537
- Who said so?
- You did!

01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:24.440
I said, ''She can't broadcast her affairs
without them appearing in the <i>scandals.''</i>

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.375
- She didn't broadcast them.
- Who did?

01:04:26.445 --> 01:04:28.538
You made it perfectly impossible for Mary.

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:31.048
That's the sort of talk
that mixes everything all up.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:32.948
The paraffin bath is ready now.

01:04:33.019 --> 01:04:36.079
Don't worry,
I'll give Dupuyster a ring. I'll fix it.

01:04:36.155 --> 01:04:37.213
How?

01:04:37.323 --> 01:04:39.951
- I'll say you were lying.
- You'll do no such thing!

01:04:40.026 --> 01:04:42.893
Then let the story ride.
It'll be forgotten in the morning.

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:46.261
Remember what they wrote about that girl
who jumped out the window?

01:04:46.332 --> 01:04:49.324
See, I can't even remember her name.
So who cares?

01:04:49.835 --> 01:04:53.066
- Mrs. Potter, you come right back!
- This is like a boarding school.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:56.233
- It's such a waste of money.
- Relaxing is part of my facial.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:05:00.211
Then you should relax completely
Mrs. Potter, from the chin up.

01:05:00.279 --> 01:05:02.804
Honestly, the class feeling
you run into nowadays.

01:05:02.882 --> 01:05:05.112
I'm so sick of creatures who insult you.

01:05:05.184 --> 01:05:08.915
Sylvia is a perfectly dreadful woman
and I'm going to tell her so!

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:12.856
She can't help it. It's her tough luck
that she wasn't born deaf and dumb.

01:05:12.925 --> 01:05:16.656
Take a tip from me.
Keep out of other women's troubles.

01:05:16.729 --> 01:05:19.527
I've never had a fight
with a girlfriend in my life.

01:05:19.599 --> 01:05:22.966
I see no evil, I hear no evil, I speak no evil.

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:41.411
Your idea of love and mine
are slightly different, Stephen!

01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:45.153
I don't like being one of a group,
even if I am first!

01:05:49.962 --> 01:05:52.897
Stephen, we can't go on like this.

01:05:58.771 --> 01:06:00.398
What's happened?

01:06:03.009 --> 01:06:05.307
It's come. They're having a showdown.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:08.677
- What's happened?
- Give me a cup of coffee and I'll tell you.

01:06:08.748 --> 01:06:11.876
She said that he's put her
in an impossible situation.

01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:15.614
People point at her in the street
because of the picture in the papers.

01:06:15.688 --> 01:06:16.882
Ain't it the truth!

01:06:16.956 --> 01:06:19.789
He blames it on her girlfriends
for spilling it all.

01:06:19.859 --> 01:06:22.259
That ain't far from wrong, either.

01:06:22.495 --> 01:06:25.862
- Makes you lose your faith in marriage.
- Whose faith in marriage?

01:06:25.931 --> 01:06:29.059
- Don't you believe in marriage?
- Sure I do, for women.

01:06:29.135 --> 01:06:31.330
But it's the sons of Adam
they have to marry.

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:32.962
What else did they say?

01:06:33.039 --> 01:06:36.236
Mr. Haines says,
<i>''I</i> told you I'd give her up and I did.

01:06:36.308 --> 01:06:38.572
''And I was a swine about the way I did <i>it.''</i>

01:06:38.644 --> 01:06:40.168
How do you think he did it?

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.544
Maybe he said,
''Scram, the wife is on to <i>us.''</i>

01:06:42.615 --> 01:06:46.449
She seemed hurt by him saying
he was a swine the way he gave her up.

01:06:46.519 --> 01:06:49.818
So she says very quiet,
''Would you like to go back to her? <i>''</i>

01:06:49.889 --> 01:06:51.754
Did he lie in his teeth to that one?

01:06:51.824 --> 01:06:54.315
The way he said he wouldn't,
I kind of believed him.

01:06:54.393 --> 01:06:58.489
She said, ''You should really make
your manner more convincing, <i>Stephen.''</i>

01:06:58.564 --> 01:07:01.533
Then she tried to laugh,
but it didn't come off very well.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.330
And he says,
''Aren't you ever going to trust me again? <i>''</i>

01:07:04.403 --> 01:07:05.734
I hope she said, ''No.''

01:07:05.805 --> 01:07:09.263
You can't trust none of them
no further than I can kick this lemon pie.

01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:12.538
No, he said this girl was really a good girl.

01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:16.513
That's why he feels he owes her.
She wouldn't take nothing for months.

01:07:16.582 --> 01:07:19.710
That one's a clever one.
She'd have to be to get Mr. Haines.

01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:21.912
That's what the madam said. She said:

01:07:21.987 --> 01:07:25.889
''Stephen, can't you see the girl is only
interested in you for your money? <i>''</i>

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:27.425
That made him sore.

01:07:27.493 --> 01:07:31.088
A man hates to be told no woman
but his wife is fool enough to love him.

01:07:31.163 --> 01:07:34.360
She brought up him taking Little Mary
to lunch with that creature.

01:07:34.433 --> 01:07:38.233
He said she happened to be passing by
as he and Little Mary were taking lunch.

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:40.864
- That's a laugh.
- That's the way she took it.

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:43.204
Then they both got mad.
He started telling her...

01:07:43.275 --> 01:07:46.904
...what a good husband he'd been and
how hard he'd worked for her and Mary.

01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:50.915
She kept interrupting, saying that
she wasn't such a washout herself.

01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:54.885
Anybody that's ever been married
knows that line backwards and forwards.

01:07:54.954 --> 01:07:57.422
Then somewhere in there, he starts saying:

01:07:57.523 --> 01:08:01.084
''Mary, I may have been a heel,
but you've always been first with <i>me.''</i>

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.220
First! Don't that sound like a husband!

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:07.993
That's what she thought, I guess.
Because she said kind of hysterical:

01:08:08.067 --> 01:08:11.833
''Stephen, I don't go for being one
of a group, even if I am <i>first.''</i>

01:08:11.904 --> 01:08:14.168
That gets him kind of sore and he says:

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.970
<i>''I</i> don't ask you to be fair to me,
but please remember we have a child...

01:08:18.042 --> 01:08:21.410
<i>''...and</i> we do owe her <i>something.''</i>
That's when she really blew up.

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:25.506
No woman wants to be told she's being
kept on just to run a kindergarten.

01:08:25.584 --> 01:08:27.950
Finally it got to him saying:

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.488
''You've known about us for weeks...

01:08:30.555 --> 01:08:33.184
<i>''...why</i> did you wait until now
to make a fool of me? <i>''</i>

01:08:33.259 --> 01:08:34.850
As if he needed her help!

01:08:34.926 --> 01:08:39.921
Then she says suddenly in a low voice,
''We can't go on like <i>this.''</i>

01:08:40.166 --> 01:08:43.294
And he says, ''You're right, we <i>can't.''</i>

01:08:43.602 --> 01:08:45.502
You're quite an actress, ain't you?

01:08:45.571 --> 01:08:48.095
My boyfriend says I got eyes
like Jeanette McDonald's.

01:08:48.174 --> 01:08:49.937
Did he say anything about your legs?

01:08:50.009 --> 01:08:52.944
- How did it all end?
- It ain't ended. They're still at it.

01:08:53.011 --> 01:08:54.843
Then what are you doing down here?

01:08:54.913 --> 01:08:58.372
Get back there and see who's ahead.
We may be out of our jobs tomorrow.

01:09:17.469 --> 01:09:19.903
- Well?
- I want some more coffee. I'm done in.

01:09:19.971 --> 01:09:22.167
Relax and tell me everything
that happened.

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:24.505
When I got there, the first thing I heard...

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:27.341
...was the madam saying,
<i>''I</i> want a <i>divorce.''</i>

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:28.402
Abdicating!

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:30.573
You could have knocked him down
with a feather.

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:33.209
I'd like to knock him down with this.
What did he say?

01:09:33.285 --> 01:09:36.982
He said he didn't blame her,
but he wished she'd think things over.

01:09:37.055 --> 01:09:41.015
He said she should go to bed
and he was going out for some fresh air.

01:09:41.093 --> 01:09:43.425
- The old hat trick!
- And she says, ''Fresh air! <i>''</i>

01:09:43.495 --> 01:09:47.430
''ls the air fresher in the Viceroy Hotel? <i>''</i>
That's where the girl lives.

01:09:47.499 --> 01:09:51.832
He says, ''You never want to see me again
and then I can't even go out for <i>air.''</i>

01:09:51.904 --> 01:09:55.237
You shouldn't let them out without a leash.
What happened then?

01:09:55.307 --> 01:09:58.071
Nothing for a time,
he just kept walking up and down.

01:09:58.143 --> 01:09:59.508
He was thinking.

01:09:59.578 --> 01:10:02.240
Then he said he was going out,
so I got ready to scoot.

01:10:02.314 --> 01:10:05.909
I heard her call, ''Stephen! <i>''</i>
And he stops on the landing and she says:

01:10:05.985 --> 01:10:08.818
''Don't slam the front door,
the servants might <i>hear.''</i>

01:10:08.888 --> 01:10:10.480
So I came down here.

01:10:10.556 --> 01:10:12.751
I feel so sad for her.

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:16.189
- Do you think they're going to break up?
- I don't know.

01:10:16.262 --> 01:10:20.221
The first man that can explain
how he can be in love with his wife...

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:24.861
...and another woman, is going to win
that prize they give out in Sweden.

01:11:00.496 --> 01:11:03.158
- Here are some books you can put in.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:11:03.232 --> 01:11:05.826
Mr. Haines won't want that old thing.

01:11:09.238 --> 01:11:11.968
- It's none of my business.
- Mrs. Haines.

01:11:14.543 --> 01:11:16.408
Put this in, too, will you?

01:11:18.014 --> 01:11:19.413
The train leaves in an hour.

01:11:19.482 --> 01:11:22.212
Give yourself plenty of time.
The traffic is maddening.

01:11:22.284 --> 01:11:23.615
Yes, Mother.

01:11:25.054 --> 01:11:28.512
Stephen's secretary is bringing around
more papers for me to sign.

01:11:28.591 --> 01:11:30.821
I never knew there could be so many.

01:11:30.893 --> 01:11:32.827
You've shown everything to your lawyers?

01:11:32.895 --> 01:11:35.227
They keep telling me
I'm getting a raw deal.

01:11:36.232 --> 01:11:38.598
It isn't true.
Stephen's been very generous.

01:11:38.668 --> 01:11:41.831
I'm sure he has.
You're both making a terrible mistake.

01:11:41.904 --> 01:11:44.372
- Please, Mother.
- You and Stephen have a child.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.840
What good will it do her...

01:11:46.909 --> 01:11:50.902
...to be brought up in a house
full of quarreling and suspicion?

01:11:52.314 --> 01:11:54.282
She'll be better off with just me.

01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:57.717
No, she won't. A child needs both
its parents in one home.

01:11:57.787 --> 01:11:58.913
What's the use?

01:11:58.988 --> 01:12:02.151
Every argument just keeps
going around in circles.

01:12:03.225 --> 01:12:05.955
Besides, it's too late now.

01:12:06.195 --> 01:12:08.891
No. It's never too late
when you love someone.

01:12:08.964 --> 01:12:11.933
Call this off.
Stephen doesn't want a divorce.

01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:15.266
- Why doesn't he fight me on it, then?
- He's not the fighting kind!

01:12:15.337 --> 01:12:17.999
- Neither am I.
- Blast these modern laws!

01:12:18.074 --> 01:12:22.135
50 years ago, women couldn't get divorces
and made the best of situations like this.

01:12:22.211 --> 01:12:26.477
Sometimes, out of situations like this,
they made very good things indeed.

01:12:26.549 --> 01:12:29.450
- Mr. Haines' secretary, ma'am.
- I'll see her in a few minutes.

01:12:29.518 --> 01:12:33.010
Bathe your eyes. You don't want that
adding machine to see you like this.

01:12:33.089 --> 01:12:35.114
Remember, you have to tell Little Mary.

01:12:35.191 --> 01:12:38.524
Yes, I'm going to
but I've been putting it off <i>because...</i>

01:12:38.594 --> 01:12:43.224
You're hoping that a miracle will keep you
from making a mess of your life.

01:12:48.671 --> 01:12:52.004
Did you ever think
that Stephen might marry that girl?

01:12:58.047 --> 01:12:59.105
No.

01:13:01.217 --> 01:13:04.243
- He wouldn't do that.
- What makes you so sure?

01:13:07.857 --> 01:13:11.190
Because Stephen, deep down,
still loves me.

01:13:13.195 --> 01:13:16.221
But he won't find it out
until I've gone away.

01:13:20.503 --> 01:13:24.564
Make Mary write to me
in Reno at least once a week, will you?

01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:28.605
And don't spoil her too much.

01:13:28.844 --> 01:13:32.473
Spoil her? You'd think
I never raised children of my own.

01:13:36.285 --> 01:13:39.118
Good afternoon.
This is Miss Trimmerback from the office.

01:13:39.188 --> 01:13:41.122
- She's a notary.
- How do you do?

01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:43.351
I brought the inventories of the furniture.

01:13:43.425 --> 01:13:47.589
Mr. Haines wants to know
if he can have the portrait of Little Mary.

01:13:48.264 --> 01:13:51.062
- Yes, but it's in storage.
- This will get it out.

01:13:51.133 --> 01:13:52.566
Sign here.

01:13:54.403 --> 01:13:56.735
The cook's letter of reference.

01:13:56.906 --> 01:13:58.339
Sign here.

01:13:59.008 --> 01:14:01.499
The insurance papers. Sign here.

01:14:02.978 --> 01:14:05.845
Transfer papers on the car.
What do you want done with it?

01:14:05.915 --> 01:14:08.042
- I don't know.
- I'll find a garage.

01:14:08.117 --> 01:14:11.211
Do you care to rent this apartment,
Mrs. Haines?

01:14:11.954 --> 01:14:13.819
I thought of taking a smaller one.

01:14:13.889 --> 01:14:17.985
This will give us power of attorney
until you return. Sign here.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.621
Your husband took the privilege
of drawing you a new will.

01:14:22.531 --> 01:14:23.896
I'd <i>really...</i>

01:14:23.966 --> 01:14:27.129
It's to your advantage, not his.
This will cuts off Mr. Haines.

01:14:27.203 --> 01:14:29.398
Your attorneys
overlooked that small detail.

01:14:29.471 --> 01:14:32.463
We'll need three witnesses.
Your maid will do.

01:14:32.641 --> 01:14:35.542
Jane, will you witness this? It's my will.

01:14:35.611 --> 01:14:37.704
- Mrs. Haines!
- Sign here.

01:14:39.181 --> 01:14:42.309
You can always make changes
in the event of your remarriage.

01:14:42.384 --> 01:14:46.150
Don't hesitate to let me know
if there's anything I can ever do for you.

01:14:46.222 --> 01:14:48.156
There'll be nothing, Miss Watts.

01:14:48.224 --> 01:14:50.818
There are always tag ends to a divorce,
Mrs. Haines.

01:14:50.893 --> 01:14:55.387
You know how Mr. Haines hates to be
bothered with inconsequential details.

01:14:55.464 --> 01:14:58.558
Good afternoon, Mrs. Haines.
A pleasant journey to you.

01:14:58.634 --> 01:14:59.862
Goodbye.

01:15:00.069 --> 01:15:01.934
Goodbye, Mrs. Haines.

01:15:02.404 --> 01:15:04.463
I wish you weren't going.

01:15:04.707 --> 01:15:06.174
Thank you.

01:15:07.142 --> 01:15:10.168
Mr. Haines said
to give these to you, ma'am.

01:15:38.974 --> 01:15:41.169
- Mother, where are you?
- Here, dear.

01:15:42.311 --> 01:15:45.405
- All set, dear?
- Yes. All set.

01:15:46.849 --> 01:15:50.751
Mary, Mother would like to have
a talk with you before she goes.

01:15:50.819 --> 01:15:52.548
I'll wait for you.

01:15:56.425 --> 01:15:58.393
- Mary?
- Yes, Mother?

01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:11.736
- Have I done something wrong?
- No, darling.

01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:15.834
Sit down, dear.

01:16:23.719 --> 01:16:25.949
You know Daddy
has been gone for some time.

01:16:27.022 --> 01:16:28.580
A whole month.

01:16:29.558 --> 01:16:31.856
- Shall I tell you why?
- Why?

01:16:37.566 --> 01:16:41.093
You know when a man and woman
fall in love, what they do, don't you?

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:42.694
They kiss a lot.

01:16:43.105 --> 01:16:46.836
- They get married.
- Yes, and then they have little children.

01:16:47.309 --> 01:16:51.746
Sometimes married people
don't stay in love.

01:16:52.448 --> 01:16:54.006
What, Mother?

01:16:54.283 --> 01:16:57.150
A husband and a wife fall out of love.

01:16:57.353 --> 01:16:59.150
Why do they do that?

01:16:59.922 --> 01:17:02.220
I don't know, but they do.

01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:06.728
And when they do,
they get un-married. You see?

01:17:06.962 --> 01:17:08.020
No.

01:17:09.898 --> 01:17:11.695
They do. That's all.

01:17:12.334 --> 01:17:15.462
They get what is called a divorce.

01:17:15.971 --> 01:17:17.199
Do they?

01:17:18.273 --> 01:17:20.798
- You don't know what a divorce is?
- Yes, I do.

01:17:20.876 --> 01:17:24.073
Lots of my friends have
mommies and daddies who are divorced.

01:17:24.146 --> 01:17:27.115
You know I love you very much, don't you?

01:17:27.683 --> 01:17:29.082
Of course.

01:17:32.388 --> 01:17:36.825
So you see, Daddy and Mommy
are going to get a divorce.

01:17:39.061 --> 01:17:40.858
That's why I'm going away.

01:17:42.364 --> 01:17:44.059
That's why <i>I...</i>

01:17:50.272 --> 01:17:54.072
Darling, I can't explain quite, but...

01:17:55.344 --> 01:17:58.643
...when you're older,
I know you'll understand...

01:17:58.714 --> 01:18:01.239
...and you'll forgive me. You will.

01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:03.042
Baby...

01:18:04.286 --> 01:18:06.117
...look at me, please.

01:18:12.795 --> 01:18:14.160
I am looking at you.

01:18:16.465 --> 01:18:18.763
Doesn't Daddy love you anymore?

01:18:20.869 --> 01:18:22.700
No, dear, he doesn't.

01:18:23.405 --> 01:18:25.168
Don't you love him?

01:18:26.842 --> 01:18:29.811
<i>I...</i> No, Mary.

01:18:30.345 --> 01:18:33.405
- Mother, why?
- I don't know, but it isn't Daddy's fault.

01:18:33.482 --> 01:18:36.007
Or it isn't Mommy's fault. It's <i>just...</i>

01:18:36.151 --> 01:18:39.609
But I thought when you loved somebody...

01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:42.919
...you loved them until the day you die.

01:18:43.725 --> 01:18:46.353
With children, yes.
But grownups are different.

01:18:46.428 --> 01:18:48.453
They can fall out of love.

01:18:48.931 --> 01:18:52.594
I won't fall out of love with you and Daddy
when I grow up.

01:18:52.668 --> 01:18:54.533
Will you fall out of love with me?

01:18:54.603 --> 01:18:57.800
No, darling. Never!
But that's different, too.

01:18:57.873 --> 01:19:01.832
- But I don't see how!
- You'll have to take my word for it, baby.

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:06.040
The divorce has nothing to do
with our love for you. Don't you see?

01:19:06.115 --> 01:19:07.480
But if you and Daddy...

01:19:07.549 --> 01:19:10.347
Darling, I can explain it better
on the way to the train.

01:19:10.419 --> 01:19:13.013
We'll go alone in the car. Shall we?

01:19:13.355 --> 01:19:16.688
If you and Daddy
are going to get a divorce...

01:19:17.593 --> 01:19:20.892
...which one won't I see again,
Daddy or you?

01:19:21.497 --> 01:19:23.522
You'll live with me, Mary.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.296
That's what happens
when people get divorced.

01:19:27.369 --> 01:19:29.894
Children must go with their mothers.

01:19:30.105 --> 01:19:32.505
But you'll see Daddy often, dear.

01:19:35.444 --> 01:19:36.843
Come along, darling.

01:19:36.912 --> 01:19:39.847
- Please wait for me in the car.
- Why?

01:19:40.516 --> 01:19:42.507
I have to wash my hands.

01:19:59.535 --> 01:20:01.799
Please, Mother!

01:20:02.371 --> 01:20:04.737
Daddy, darling!

01:20:05.407 --> 01:20:09.468
Why don't you do something?
Do something, Mother dear!

01:20:09.811 --> 01:20:11.711
Do something!

01:20:27.529 --> 01:20:30.089
Please, darling, don't. You mustn't.

01:20:30.165 --> 01:20:34.067
Who'd have thought
that I'd be going to Reno, too?

01:20:34.136 --> 01:20:35.330
I know.

01:20:36.071 --> 01:20:37.060
Come in.

01:20:37.139 --> 01:20:40.006
- Is you the lady that needs the toothbrush?
- Yes.

01:20:40.776 --> 01:20:43.609
You made up your mind
to come on this trip in a hurry?

01:20:43.679 --> 01:20:45.442
- Yes.
- I thought you did.

01:20:45.514 --> 01:20:47.675
The porter will be
making your room up next.

01:20:47.749 --> 01:20:49.011
Thank you.

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.411
Did you hear from Stephen?

01:20:53.589 --> 01:20:57.081
This? No, that's from an old beau.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.695
You'll be having lots of beaus now,
won't you?

01:21:02.898 --> 01:21:05.867
I won't. I'll never look at another man.

01:21:06.268 --> 01:21:09.135
When I think of the things he said to me!
My Johnny!

01:21:09.204 --> 01:21:11.399
He wouldn't let me buy a car
with my money.

01:21:11.473 --> 01:21:14.169
Just because he couldn't afford one,
I can't have one!

01:21:14.243 --> 01:21:16.302
- He wants me to be a slave!
- No, he doesn't.

01:21:16.378 --> 01:21:17.868
Yes, he does!

01:21:18.013 --> 01:21:21.073
The only protection I have
is my own little income.

01:21:21.149 --> 01:21:24.380
- Sounds like Sylvia.
- This time she's right.

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:28.786
If I couldn't have caught
this train to be with you...

01:21:29.091 --> 01:21:31.821
...l'd have jumped right in front of it!

01:21:32.461 --> 01:21:35.191
That would have been quite a feat, dear.

01:21:36.431 --> 01:21:38.092
I'm such a fool.

01:21:39.735 --> 01:21:41.532
Maybe Johnny is right.

01:21:43.205 --> 01:21:45.833
Stop it. You'll have me crying, too.

01:21:49.578 --> 01:21:50.602
Yes, dear.

01:21:50.679 --> 01:21:52.271
Listen to the wheels.

01:21:52.581 --> 01:21:55.880
- Do they seem to be saying anything?
- No.

01:21:56.351 --> 01:22:02.756
Don't they seem to be saying, ''Go <i>back''?</i>

01:22:03.292 --> 01:22:05.522
Why don't you go back to him?

01:22:05.594 --> 01:22:09.086
I can't. After all, I have my pride.

01:22:12.668 --> 01:22:13.965
I know.

01:22:14.603 --> 01:22:19.199
- You better get some sleep, dear.
- All right. I'll see you in the morning.

01:22:22.044 --> 01:22:25.013
- lf you can't sleep, dear, send for me.
- I will.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.172
Good night.

01:22:26.248 --> 01:22:29.274
- Porter's ready now, Mrs. Haines.
- Thank you.

01:22:33.689 --> 01:22:34.781
What, darling?

01:22:34.856 --> 01:22:38.053
- Mommy, will Daddy come to Reno?
- No, darling.

01:22:38.126 --> 01:22:41.061
- Mommy, where is Daddy?
- I don't know and I don't care.

01:22:41.129 --> 01:22:43.723
In the future,
please refer to him as ''That <i>Heel''!</i>

01:22:47.169 --> 01:22:49.137
<i>Chérie,</i> won't you join me
in some champagne?

01:22:51.606 --> 01:22:53.164
Why, yes.

01:22:53.375 --> 01:22:56.776
You look so <i>désolée,</i>
sitting there all by yourself.

01:22:56.845 --> 01:22:58.779
- Did I?
- I'm the Countess De Lave.

01:22:58.847 --> 01:23:01.247
Of course,
I've seen your pictures in the paper.

01:23:01.316 --> 01:23:04.410
- And I've seen yours, too.
- I'm Mrs. Stephen Haines.

01:23:04.786 --> 01:23:06.549
Yes, of course.

01:23:06.822 --> 01:23:10.417
Those crummy newspaper pictures
didn't do you half justice.

01:23:10.492 --> 01:23:14.155
Let's all have a little party.
You, too, dearie.

01:23:14.296 --> 01:23:18.289
Now, don't sit in the corner and mope.
Let's all have a little drink.

01:23:18.367 --> 01:23:21.302
Champagne? Right you are.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.609
This sweet little thing
is getting her first divorce, too.

01:23:28.677 --> 01:23:31.771
She's a dear friend of mine.
What did you say your name was?

01:23:31.847 --> 01:23:34.475
- Miriam Aarons.
- This is Mrs. Haines.

01:23:35.384 --> 01:23:38.251
Yanked the scalp off that Allen woman
in the fitting room.

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.379
Yeah! Good for you!

01:23:40.455 --> 01:23:43.390
I was afraid you were
a wet firecracker, sister. Shake!

01:23:43.458 --> 01:23:45.824
- Hello.
- Cheer up, <i>chérie.</i>

01:23:45.894 --> 01:23:48.624
Wait until you've lost as many
husbands as I have.

01:23:48.697 --> 01:23:53.464
Married, divorced, married, divorced,
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>

01:23:53.602 --> 01:23:55.570
- That's French for ''love.''
<i>- Oui, oui.</i>

01:23:55.637 --> 01:23:58.265
But where love leads, I always follow.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.036
Take it, dearie. Dip that pretty little beak.

01:24:01.109 --> 01:24:03.134
Happy days.

01:24:03.845 --> 01:24:05.312
Happy nights!

01:24:07.516 --> 01:24:11.475
Mrs. Aarons is connected with the stage
or is it the circus, dear?

01:24:11.553 --> 01:24:14.886
- It was the chorus.
- You must tell us all about it, sometime.

01:24:14.956 --> 01:24:18.722
I bet you made some great hauls
out of our New York boyfriends.

01:24:18.794 --> 01:24:23.163
If you mean diamonds and orchids,
that breed died out just before my time.

01:24:23.231 --> 01:24:24.755
Yes, isn't it a pity?

01:24:24.866 --> 01:24:28.427
I never got a <i>sou</i> out of anybody,
except my first husband, Mr. Strauss.

01:24:28.503 --> 01:24:32.030
He said the most touching thing in his will.
I remember every word of it.

01:24:32.107 --> 01:24:35.907
He said, ''To my beloved wife, Flora,
I leave all my estate...

01:24:35.977 --> 01:24:40.414
<i>''...to</i> be administered by executors,
because she is an A-1 <i>schlemiel.''</i>

01:24:40.649 --> 01:24:41.809
Wasn't that sweet?

01:24:41.883 --> 01:24:44.613
Any ladle is sweet
that dishes out some gravy.

01:24:44.686 --> 01:24:48.679
Isn't it true? None of my other husbands
ever gave me a dime.

01:24:49.391 --> 01:24:53.259
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>
How it can let you down!

01:24:54.696 --> 01:24:58.393
How it can pick you up again, too.
Where is this wretched train taking us?

01:24:58.467 --> 01:25:01.095
- We're in the mountains, dear.
- I detest mountains.

01:25:01.169 --> 01:25:04.866
They always remind me of the day Gustave
made me climb to the top of an Alp.

01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:08.671
Gustave was my third husband.
Give Flora another little drinkie, dear.

01:25:08.743 --> 01:25:10.210
There we were...

01:25:10.378 --> 01:25:13.541
...when suddenly it struck me
that Gustave had pushed me.

01:25:13.615 --> 01:25:16.482
I slid halfway down the mountain
before I realized...

01:25:16.551 --> 01:25:18.985
...that he didn't love me anymore.

01:25:19.054 --> 01:25:20.817
But love takes care of its own.

01:25:20.889 --> 01:25:23.915
I slid right into the arms
of my fourth husband, the Count!

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:29.597
- Isn't that the bird you're divorcing now?
- But of course. What else could I do?

01:25:29.664 --> 01:25:31.928
He was putting poison
in my headache powders.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.401
Poison! You're not
a very good judge of character, are you?

01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:37.768
No, that's the trouble with me.

01:25:37.939 --> 01:25:42.706
I don't pick them for character.
I'll bet you picked yours for character.

01:25:43.044 --> 01:25:45.444
Yes, in a way.

01:25:45.514 --> 01:25:48.745
Yes, and where did it get you?
On the train for Reno.

01:25:49.551 --> 01:25:51.416
On the train for Reno!

01:25:52.053 --> 01:25:54.851
My way, your marriage
may not last until death...

01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:58.289
...but it's fun while it hangs together.

01:25:58.827 --> 01:26:02.228
I think it's cruel sitting around
waiting for somebody to die.

01:26:02.297 --> 01:26:04.731
- What did you pick yours for?
- Not for character!

01:26:04.799 --> 01:26:09.202
There you are. No matter what
you pick them for, where does it get you?

01:26:09.838 --> 01:26:13.501
- On the train for Reno.
- On the train for Reno!

01:26:13.742 --> 01:26:17.178
Let's all have another drinkie. To Reno!

01:26:17.245 --> 01:26:21.181
The biggest little city in the world,
American cradle of liberty.

01:26:21.316 --> 01:26:24.479
Reno, beautiful emblem of the great divide.

01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:31.484
What's the matter, dearie,
cat got your tongue?

01:26:34.362 --> 01:26:35.522
To Reno.

01:26:39.601 --> 01:26:41.466
''Down on Old Smokey
All covered with snow

01:26:41.836 --> 01:26:44.634
<i>''I</i> lost my true lover
From courting too slow

01:26:46.274 --> 01:26:50.734
''Courting is pleasure
Parting is grief

01:26:50.979 --> 01:26:55.348
''And a false-hearted lover
Is worse than a thief

01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:59.584
''The grave will decay you
And turn you to dust

01:26:59.955 --> 01:27:04.289
''Ain't one boy out of 20
A poor girl can <i>trust''</i>

01:27:04.359 --> 01:27:06.554
- Lucy?
- Hello, honey. How's tricks?

01:27:06.628 --> 01:27:07.856
Where's Mrs. Haines?

01:27:07.929 --> 01:27:11.990
She'll be moseying around pretty soon.
For the six weeks she's been here...

01:27:12.067 --> 01:27:14.797
...she's never been far away
when the mail comes in.

01:27:14.869 --> 01:27:18.896
Wish that man of hers would send her
a letter, a telegram or something.

01:27:18.974 --> 01:27:21.909
Men are all like that. Anything for me?

01:27:21.977 --> 01:27:24.002
Nary a postcard, dearie.

01:27:24.245 --> 01:27:27.180
You'll miss her a lot
when she leaves tomorrow, won't you?

01:27:27.248 --> 01:27:28.613
Yes, I will.

01:27:29.050 --> 01:27:31.314
I ain't finished getting
her packing done yet.

01:27:31.386 --> 01:27:34.480
Come on. You can mope in her room
as well as anywhere else.

01:27:34.889 --> 01:27:37.722
Why didn't you get divorced
this morning with Mrs. Haines?

01:27:37.792 --> 01:27:40.056
I had to wait for some papers
from New York.

01:27:40.161 --> 01:27:41.150
I see.

01:27:41.229 --> 01:27:45.256
Truth to tell, I'll miss Mrs. H., too.
She's about the nicest ever came here.

01:27:45.333 --> 01:27:48.166
- I hate Reno.
- You didn't come for fun.

01:27:48.236 --> 01:27:50.602
''The grave will decay you
And turn you to dust

01:27:50.672 --> 01:27:53.835
''There ain't one boy out of 20
A poor girl can <i>trust''</i>

01:27:54.209 --> 01:27:56.507
You've seen a lot of divorcées,
haven't you?

01:27:56.578 --> 01:27:58.739
Been cooking for them for 10 years.

01:27:58.813 --> 01:28:01.475
- Do you feel sorry for us?
- Ma'am, I don't.

01:28:01.549 --> 01:28:05.041
You feel sorry enough for yourselves.
You ain't got much else to do.

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:07.554
You've never been married.

01:28:07.622 --> 01:28:08.884
I've had three!

01:28:08.957 --> 01:28:10.117
- Husbands?
- Kids.

01:28:11.426 --> 01:28:13.792
Then you're probably very happy.

01:28:14.095 --> 01:28:17.758
Good gracious, ma'am, I stopped
thinking about being happy long ago.

01:28:17.832 --> 01:28:22.292
- You don't think about being happy?
- Ain't had the time with the kids and all.

01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:24.634
The old man's such a demon
when he's drinking.

01:28:24.706 --> 01:28:28.403
Them big, strong,
red-headed men, they're fierce.

01:28:29.444 --> 01:28:31.469
He beat you! How terrible!

01:28:31.613 --> 01:28:34.275
Yes, when you think
that a lot of women on the ranch...

01:28:34.349 --> 01:28:36.874
...need a beating worse than I do.

01:28:37.852 --> 01:28:39.820
I'll get Buck to come fix that thing.

01:28:39.888 --> 01:28:43.221
But you live in Reno.
You could get a divorce overnight.

01:28:43.291 --> 01:28:46.692
A woman can't get herself
worked up to a thing like that overnight!

01:28:49.097 --> 01:28:50.462
Hello, Peggy!

01:28:51.199 --> 01:28:55.295
Hi, Countess! You've seen enough.
Let's get out there with the Countess.

01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:57.963
Is Mrs. Haines around?

01:28:58.106 --> 01:29:00.631
No, Countess. But come on in.
She'll be here soon, the mail has come.

01:29:07.115 --> 01:29:11.313
Now she wants to see Mrs. Haines.
I've simply got to see her alone.

01:29:11.786 --> 01:29:14.311
- How are you, dear child?
- All right.

01:29:14.389 --> 01:29:17.085
Did you see the doctor? What did he say?

01:29:17.158 --> 01:29:19.251
He said it was the altitude.

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.988
My dear, you've got
the Reno jumpy-wumpsies.

01:29:22.163 --> 01:29:23.755
Here's a wee juggy.

01:29:23.832 --> 01:29:27.268
- We must celebrate Mrs. Haines' divorce.
- Right you are, Countess.

01:29:27.502 --> 01:29:30.528
Countess, I don't think a divorce
is anything to celebrate.

01:29:30.605 --> 01:29:33.540
''lf the ocean was whiskey
And I was a duck

01:29:33.675 --> 01:29:36.940
''I'd dive to the bottom
And never come up

01:29:37.178 --> 01:29:41.342
''Baby, I've told you before

01:29:41.449 --> 01:29:45.146
''The more I drink whiskey
I love you the <i>more''</i>

01:29:47.188 --> 01:29:48.951
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>

01:29:51.259 --> 01:29:53.989
- Have you ever been in love?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:29:54.062 --> 01:29:55.927
Tell us about it.

01:29:56.498 --> 01:29:59.092
Ma'am, ain't much to tell.

01:29:59.734 --> 01:30:01.793
I kind of enjoyed the courting time.

01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:06.131
It was as pretty a sight as you ever saw
to see him come loping across them hills.

01:30:06.207 --> 01:30:09.199
The sky was so big and blue
and that brick top of his...

01:30:09.277 --> 01:30:11.404
...blazing like the bejiggers in the sun.

01:30:11.479 --> 01:30:13.811
Then we'd sit on my back fence and spark.

01:30:13.882 --> 01:30:16.749
Ma'am, you know how them
big, strong red-headed men are.

01:30:16.818 --> 01:30:19.184
They just got to get to the point.

01:30:19.254 --> 01:30:20.915
So we got married, ma'am.

01:30:21.156 --> 01:30:23.989
Naturally, I ain't had no chance
to think about love since.

01:30:24.459 --> 01:30:27.394
Hello, Countess.
How's the rhythm on the range?

01:30:27.462 --> 01:30:29.396
Simply divine, my dear.

01:30:29.464 --> 01:30:32.627
Gallop madly over the sagebrush.

01:30:32.734 --> 01:30:34.725
- Hello, sunshine.
- Hello.

01:30:35.303 --> 01:30:38.238
What you need is a wee drinkie
of this good corn liquor.

01:30:38.306 --> 01:30:40.934
- No, thanks.
- Is that invitation general, Countess?

01:30:41.009 --> 01:30:43.944
Yes, indeedy, as we say on the range.

01:30:44.612 --> 01:30:49.015
Here's to freedom. Day after tomorrow,
I shall be free. Free as a bird.

01:30:49.284 --> 01:30:51.343
That little French buzzard.

01:30:53.188 --> 01:30:55.019
Wither shall I fly?

01:30:55.490 --> 01:30:58.288
To the arms of our pet cowboy, darling.

01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:02.057
- Miriam Aarons!
- Why he's plum loco for you, Countess.

01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:05.463
He likes you even better than his horse,
and it's a blasted big horse.

01:31:05.533 --> 01:31:09.560
Buck Winston is nice.
He's so young and strong.

01:31:09.637 --> 01:31:13.573
Have you noticed
the play of his muscles? Musical!

01:31:13.808 --> 01:31:16.800
You don't mean to say his joints squeak?

01:31:17.612 --> 01:31:20.046
He could crack a coconut
with those knees...

01:31:20.114 --> 01:31:21.979
...if he could get them together.

01:31:22.050 --> 01:31:23.415
Say, Countess...

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:28.621
...that guy hasn't been arousing
your honorable intentions, has he?

01:31:29.724 --> 01:31:33.125
Yes. But I'm different from the rest of you.

01:31:33.561 --> 01:31:35.995
I've always put my faith in love.

01:31:36.965 --> 01:31:39.957
Still I've had four divorces.
Dare I risk a fifth?

01:31:40.468 --> 01:31:43.562
What are you risking, Countess?
Or maybe I shouldn't ask.

01:31:43.638 --> 01:31:47.540
Alas. I fear I'd never make a success
of Buck at Newport.

01:31:47.609 --> 01:31:50.544
Why not?
They'd have to admit Buck's handsome.

01:31:50.645 --> 01:31:53.443
But if I had your dough,
I'd sell him to the radio first.

01:31:53.514 --> 01:31:54.503
Radio?

01:31:54.582 --> 01:31:59.485
Think of how his voice might sound
cooing over a microphone.

01:32:00.054 --> 01:32:02.522
Dreamily drifting over the ether.

01:32:03.958 --> 01:32:05.323
Why not?

01:32:05.927 --> 01:32:08.293
I'll turn him into a radio star.

01:32:08.997 --> 01:32:11.591
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>

01:32:12.567 --> 01:32:16.765
Miriam, when are you going to open up
and tell us your great secret?

01:32:17.338 --> 01:32:19.272
What secret, Countess?

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:23.501
About the man in your life.
After all, there must be a man.

01:32:25.079 --> 01:32:26.808
I would have spilled before...

01:32:26.881 --> 01:32:30.840
...but I found out that his wife's
a friend of our palsy-walsy's.

01:32:31.519 --> 01:32:32.781
Who is it? Tell me.

01:32:32.854 --> 01:32:36.449
- Ever hear them speak of Sylvia Fowler?
- Yes, I think so.

01:32:37.258 --> 01:32:40.056
It's the dame's husband, Howard Fowler.

01:32:40.929 --> 01:32:42.157
How sweet!

01:32:42.230 --> 01:32:44.790
Yeah, and all he had to do
to get rid of her was...

01:32:44.866 --> 01:32:46.163
You got the jackpot!

01:32:46.968 --> 01:32:48.230
Hello, girls.

01:32:48.303 --> 01:32:50.999
- Hello, babe. How does it feel to be free?
- Great.

01:32:51.072 --> 01:32:53.438
- You lie.
- Have it your own way.

01:32:53.508 --> 01:32:55.840
Mary, could I see you for a minute?

01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:58.572
Certainly, dear.
As my last official act in Reno...

01:32:58.646 --> 01:33:01.911
...l'm going to prepare the supper
with my own little hands.

01:33:01.983 --> 01:33:04.713
- Lucy, any mail?
- Here it is, my lady.

01:33:06.521 --> 01:33:08.182
It's from Edith.

01:33:08.389 --> 01:33:12.519
- Can't mistake that childish handwriting.
- Coming! Reckon that's the new boarder.

01:33:12.593 --> 01:33:15.721
Just got in on the afternoon train
from New York.

01:33:17.966 --> 01:33:19.092
Listen to this:

01:33:19.167 --> 01:33:23.297
''Dear Mary, the stork has just delivered
Phelps and me another female! <i>''</i>

01:33:23.371 --> 01:33:25.601
Good heavens! That makes eight girls.

01:33:25.673 --> 01:33:28.437
Eight little cherubs. How sweet!

01:33:28.509 --> 01:33:32.070
<i>L'amour, I'amour. Toujours I'amour!</i>

01:33:35.049 --> 01:33:37.381
Who the heck is paging <i>I'Amour?</i>

01:33:46.227 --> 01:33:48.821
Here I am, girls. Move over.

01:33:49.464 --> 01:33:51.932
- Where's the porter?
- What's that contraption?

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.228
An English saddle.

01:33:53.301 --> 01:33:56.270
I refuse to learn to ride
one of those Western things.

01:33:56.337 --> 01:33:58.669
- Did you ever see a horse laugh?
- Pardon?

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:00.401
You're going to.

01:34:00.842 --> 01:34:02.867
Here's a letter for you.

01:34:03.578 --> 01:34:07.708
Want to go to your room,
or stay here and dish with your buddies?

01:34:07.882 --> 01:34:09.440
I'll be along.

01:34:12.553 --> 01:34:14.783
<i>- Et tu, Brute?</i>
- Darling.

01:34:15.757 --> 01:34:17.384
What a gathering of the clan.

01:34:17.458 --> 01:34:20.916
- Why didn't you send a wire?
- They told me to put nothing on paper.

01:34:20.995 --> 01:34:22.656
Anyway, here I am.

01:34:23.698 --> 01:34:25.325
Another member of the big roundup?

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:27.630
This is the Countess De Lave,
Mrs. Howard Fowler.

01:34:27.702 --> 01:34:29.192
How do you do?

01:34:30.271 --> 01:34:32.603
- And Mrs. Aarons.
- How do you do?

01:34:33.141 --> 01:34:34.631
How do you do?

01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:38.042
Howard Fowler,
the man I trusted my life with...

01:34:38.112 --> 01:34:41.047
...has kicked me out for some filthy beezle.

01:34:41.115 --> 01:34:44.107
Don't go, darling. We're all girls together.

01:34:44.552 --> 01:34:47.282
- Pour Mrs. Fowler a little drinkie.
- Okay.

01:34:47.355 --> 01:34:50.017
But he couldn't have kicked you out,
not Howard.

01:34:50.091 --> 01:34:54.425
Is that so? That's all you know about him.
The man's a fiend, an absolute Borgia!

01:34:54.495 --> 01:34:56.429
You wouldn't believe the things he did.

01:34:56.497 --> 01:35:00.558
One day, he picked a quarrel with me,
so I ordered him out of the house.

01:35:00.635 --> 01:35:03.035
He had Dictographs
hidden all over the place.

01:35:03.104 --> 01:35:05.664
And I gave him complete grounds
for incompatibility.

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:09.198
All recorded on nasty little discs
in the most awful-sounding language.

01:35:09.277 --> 01:35:13.338
Then he told me that if I didn't go to Reno
to divorce him, he'd go to divorce me.

01:35:13.414 --> 01:35:15.541
Divorce me, ruin my reputation!

01:35:15.616 --> 01:35:18.380
- Who is the woman?
- Nobody knows, not even Winchell!

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.845
- Here you are, sister. Buck up!
- Thanks.

01:35:20.922 --> 01:35:23.584
Here's to cupid.
Tomorrow you can start looking around.

01:35:23.658 --> 01:35:26.354
You're right,
I don't intend to sit around and act glum.

01:35:26.427 --> 01:35:28.725
When I think of what
I've sacrificed for him.

01:35:28.796 --> 01:35:31.924
- Such as what, Mrs. Fowler?
- I gave him my youth!

01:35:33.334 --> 01:35:35.359
Air mail, special delivery.

01:35:35.436 --> 01:35:38.303
Probably a bill forwarded to me
by Howard, the skunk!

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.933
It's from Carol Hammond.

01:35:42.977 --> 01:35:45.673
She says Edith Potter's baby
is another catastrophe.

01:35:46.013 --> 01:35:48.743
Looks like Phelps has lungs like a bull.

01:35:54.122 --> 01:35:56.613
There was a clipping in here, where is it?

01:36:02.497 --> 01:36:03.555
Give me that!

01:36:06.134 --> 01:36:07.567
Hey, <i>you...</i>

01:36:08.703 --> 01:36:10.500
Wait a minute, you!

01:36:11.005 --> 01:36:13.872
- Wasn't your name Aarons?
- What's it to you, Mrs. Fowler?

01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:15.602
You stay right where you are!

01:36:16.244 --> 01:36:18.610
''Miriam Aarons is now being Renovated.

01:36:19.046 --> 01:36:21.742
''Three guesses Mrs. Fowler,
as to who she's going to <i>marry.''</i>

01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:24.010
Why, Miriam!

01:36:24.085 --> 01:36:27.646
Why can't those moldy rags
leave a successful divorce alone?

01:36:27.855 --> 01:36:29.652
- Why, you little...
- Now, Sylvia!

01:36:29.724 --> 01:36:30.850
- Did you know?
- No!

01:36:30.925 --> 01:36:32.756
What do you care? You don't love him.

01:36:32.827 --> 01:36:35.489
That is irrelevant.
How much did he settle on you?

01:36:35.563 --> 01:36:37.963
I made Howard pay for what he wants.

01:36:38.032 --> 01:36:40.796
You made him pay
for what he doesn't want.

01:36:40.868 --> 01:36:42.358
Why, you filthy...

01:36:42.436 --> 01:36:44.904
Don't call me names,
you Park Avenue playgirl!

01:36:44.972 --> 01:36:47.497
I know a lot more words than you do.

01:36:48.543 --> 01:36:50.807
Don't you dare strike me,
I've got glasses on!

01:36:50.878 --> 01:36:53.608
- Now you haven't.
- How do you like that?

01:36:56.617 --> 01:36:59.415
Miriam, darling, don't be vulgar!

01:37:02.123 --> 01:37:04.683
My hat! How do you like that?

01:37:05.793 --> 01:37:07.522
My hat! Let me go!

01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:25.376
Pretty well-matched, ain't they?

01:37:27.615 --> 01:37:28.843
Get off of me!

01:37:28.916 --> 01:37:30.178
Do something!

01:37:30.251 --> 01:37:34.654
Leave them enjoy themselves.
I'll get the smelling salts for the loser.

01:37:35.223 --> 01:37:38.522
Take it easy, Mrs. Fowler.
I'm only trying to help in my own way.

01:37:38.593 --> 01:37:40.060
You big moose!

01:37:41.662 --> 01:37:42.788
She's a cuckoo.

01:37:50.471 --> 01:37:53.269
- Who's got iodine?
- In my bathroom. Help her, Peggy.

01:37:53.341 --> 01:37:55.434
I've got to be careful of hydrophobia.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:01.947
Mary, how could you let her do that to me?

01:38:02.216 --> 01:38:03.478
Forget it.

01:38:03.551 --> 01:38:07.282
You're on her side! My own cousin.
And after all I've done for you.

01:38:07.355 --> 01:38:10.051
- Just what have you done for me?
- I warned you.

01:38:10.124 --> 01:38:12.285
I'm not exactly grateful for that.

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.521
You're getting exactly what you deserved.

01:38:14.595 --> 01:38:17.928
Plenty of the girls are tickled to death!
I hate you!

01:38:17.999 --> 01:38:22.402
I hate everybody!

01:38:22.637 --> 01:38:26.164
- Listen, Mrs. Fowler, you got the hysterics!
- You wait!

01:38:26.274 --> 01:38:30.540
Someday you'll need a girlfriend,
then you'll think of your treachery to me!

01:38:34.215 --> 01:38:35.682
Poor creatures.

01:38:36.017 --> 01:38:40.420
They've lost their equilibrium
because they've lost their faith in love.

01:38:41.322 --> 01:38:43.347
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>

01:38:43.491 --> 01:38:47.359
<i>''A</i> man can ride a horse to the range above

01:38:47.561 --> 01:38:51.190
''But a woman has to ride
on the wings of <i>love''</i>

01:38:56.170 --> 01:38:59.435
A nice little bout between
a couple of lady palookas.

01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:01.201
Right. We're really a couple of cats.

01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:05.001
- Did you want to see me, Peggy?
- Yes.

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.875
I'm going to have a baby.

01:39:10.918 --> 01:39:12.749
What shall I do?

01:39:13.054 --> 01:39:16.717
Darling! Don't cry.

01:39:18.059 --> 01:39:21.222
- That's splendid.
- Okay, baby!

01:39:21.495 --> 01:39:26.159
- What's John's telephone number?
- Eldorado 53598.

01:39:26.267 --> 01:39:30.567
- Wait a minute. What is it?
- Eldorado 53598.

01:39:31.806 --> 01:39:35.435
- I can't tell him.
- Why not? Isn't he old enough to know?

01:39:35.876 --> 01:39:37.241
Long distance, please.

01:39:37.311 --> 01:39:41.543
I always wanted a baby,
but what can I do with it now?

01:39:41.749 --> 01:39:45.378
- You can enter it for Harvard.
- Or land it with the Marines.

01:39:45.519 --> 01:39:48.181
New York. Eldorado <i>359...</i>

01:39:48.622 --> 01:39:51.887
53598.

01:39:52.126 --> 01:39:54.594
I can't tell him.
I wouldn't know how to begin.

01:39:54.662 --> 01:39:56.493
You'll know when you hear his voice.

01:39:56.564 --> 01:39:59.965
It's no use.
You don't know the things he said to me.

01:40:00.167 --> 01:40:01.896
I have my pride.

01:40:02.169 --> 01:40:05.502
Reno's full of women
who have their pride, sweetheart.

01:40:05.573 --> 01:40:09.304
It's a pretty chilly exchange
for the guy you're stuck on.

01:40:09.443 --> 01:40:11.775
Mr. Day, please. Reno calling.

01:40:12.313 --> 01:40:14.110
Mr. Day? Just a minute.

01:40:14.181 --> 01:40:17.014
Suffering Saints!
That guy must live by the phone.

01:40:17.084 --> 01:40:18.312
Johnny?

01:40:21.188 --> 01:40:25.124
Hello. No, I'm not sick.

01:40:27.762 --> 01:40:29.753
I'm all right, <i>but...</i>

01:40:30.164 --> 01:40:33.133
I'm going to have a baby.

01:40:38.038 --> 01:40:39.733
Darling, are you?

01:40:41.375 --> 01:40:42.967
Darling, do you?

01:40:43.778 --> 01:40:45.769
Darling, so do I.

01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:50.812
So do I.

01:40:51.685 --> 01:40:53.949
Of course I forgive you.

01:40:54.822 --> 01:40:59.282
Yes, precious.
Yes, lamb, on the very next train.

01:41:07.768 --> 01:41:10.362
Do you mind if I reverse the charges?

01:41:12.907 --> 01:41:14.636
Goodbye, precious.

01:41:28.122 --> 01:41:30.716
Don't expect me for dinner.
I've got to pack.

01:41:30.791 --> 01:41:31.348
What happened?

01:41:32.159 --> 01:41:35.686
When I get back I'm going to do
everything John says.

01:41:36.397 --> 01:41:37.523
Good.

01:41:37.631 --> 01:41:39.758
I'm so happy, I could cry.

01:41:43.037 --> 01:41:46.837
Listen, sister, when are you going
to get wise to yourself?

01:41:47.875 --> 01:41:49.775
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

01:41:51.612 --> 01:41:55.241
- Why, I was divorced this morning.
- A Reno divorce.

01:42:03.724 --> 01:42:06.318
No, Operator, we completed that call.

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:14.492
Listen to me.

01:42:14.935 --> 01:42:17.665
There's nothing you could say
that I haven't heard.

01:42:17.738 --> 01:42:20.172
Sure? Maybe I got a new slant.

01:42:20.407 --> 01:42:25.242
I come from a world where a woman's got
to come out on top or it's too darn bad.

01:42:25.312 --> 01:42:30.215
Talk to me all you want.
What does it come to? Compromise.

01:42:30.351 --> 01:42:33.946
What the heck! A woman is
compromised the day she's born.

01:42:35.222 --> 01:42:37.747
Can't compromise with utter defeat.

01:42:38.659 --> 01:42:40.126
He doesn't want me.

01:42:40.194 --> 01:42:43.960
- How do you know?
- I've waited every day to hear from him.

01:42:44.365 --> 01:42:47.027
- Did you write to him?
- Of course not.

01:42:47.468 --> 01:42:50.335
How do you know
he hasn't been waiting, too?

01:42:51.105 --> 01:42:54.233
Listen, honey,
I've been through all this before.

01:42:54.575 --> 01:42:56.509
I lost my man, too.

01:42:56.777 --> 01:42:57.766
You?

01:42:57.845 --> 01:43:00.643
It only happened once.
Got wise to myself after that.

01:43:00.714 --> 01:43:02.841
How did I lose him?

01:43:03.284 --> 01:43:07.186
We didn't have enough dough
to get married and I <i>wouldn't...</i>

01:43:07.588 --> 01:43:10.614
I had my pride.
Heaven knows where I got it.

01:43:11.625 --> 01:43:14.526
I liked him a lot better
than I've ever liked anybody since.

01:43:14.595 --> 01:43:17.325
One day, my Romeo took
a little walkout on me.

01:43:17.398 --> 01:43:19.662
I made a terrible row. Why shouldn't I?

01:43:19.733 --> 01:43:22.361
But what I ought not to have done
was to run away...

01:43:22.436 --> 01:43:25.564
...and leave him in the clutches
of that woman, like a coward.

01:43:25.639 --> 01:43:29.336
That's what you are, Mary Haines,
you're a blithering coward.

01:43:31.745 --> 01:43:32.871
Why?

01:43:34.515 --> 01:43:36.642
Because I wouldn't stay
to be second fiddle?

01:43:36.717 --> 01:43:40.244
Because you ran out of the trenches
under fire. You deserted him.

01:43:40.321 --> 01:43:42.915
- I deserted him?
- Sure you did.

01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:46.653
You think he wants to be
in the grip of that red-headed octopus?

01:43:46.727 --> 01:43:50.993
If you'd given him a chance,
he'd have asked you not to get a divorce.

01:43:51.865 --> 01:43:54.026
Why, Miriam, he did ask me.

01:43:54.435 --> 01:43:57.233
- And you still ran away?
- Yes.

01:43:58.606 --> 01:44:01.268
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

01:44:01.342 --> 01:44:04.937
Listen, honey, don't you know
that we dames have got to be...

01:44:05.012 --> 01:44:08.311
...a lot more to the guy we marry
than a schoolgirl sweetheart?

01:44:08.382 --> 01:44:13.081
We got to be a wife.
And a mother, and a pal.

01:44:13.253 --> 01:44:14.982
And a nursemaid.

01:44:15.556 --> 01:44:19.492
Sometimes, when it comes to the point,
we've even got to be a cutie.

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:23.690
You should have licked that girl
where she licked you, in his arms.

01:44:23.831 --> 01:44:26.061
That's where you win in the first round.

01:44:26.133 --> 01:44:29.296
And if I know men,
it's still Custer's Last Stand.

01:44:30.037 --> 01:44:31.197
Shocked you?

01:44:31.271 --> 01:44:36.072
Okay, sister, but my idea of love
is that love isn't ashamed of nothing.

01:44:36.143 --> 01:44:40.011
That's easy enough to say, Miriam,
but that girl's in his blood.

01:44:40.714 --> 01:44:43.945
I couldn't have stayed under the same roof
with him and faced that.

01:44:44.018 --> 01:44:46.680
Why not? Suppose the guy had smallpox.

01:44:46.754 --> 01:44:50.520
Would you had liked to have faced that?
But you'd have done it.

01:44:50.591 --> 01:44:55.153
This jam that he's in would make
a bad case of smallpox look like a carnival.

01:44:55.229 --> 01:44:57.789
While the poor guy's
floundering around helpless...

01:44:57.865 --> 01:45:01.130
...you remove the one protection he's got,
his legal marriage.

01:45:01.201 --> 01:45:04.830
So he's stumbling around in the open,
delirious and unprotected...

01:45:04.905 --> 01:45:07.601
...with a she-wolf in lamb's clothing
right on his heels.

01:45:08.042 --> 01:45:09.873
And not one word of comfort out of you.

01:45:09.943 --> 01:45:12.935
Because why? Because you're too busy
nursing your two-for-a-nickel pride.

01:45:14.548 --> 01:45:18.848
Operator, we <i>completed...</i>
It's New York calling Mrs. Haines?

01:45:22.222 --> 01:45:23.883
It's Mr. Haines?

01:45:24.892 --> 01:45:29.556
Tell him you'll tear that divorce decree
into a million pieces and use it for confetti.

01:45:33.567 --> 01:45:35.057
Hello, Stephen.

01:45:38.072 --> 01:45:40.267
It's so good to hear your voice.

01:45:43.477 --> 01:45:46.969
Yes, it went through on schedule
this morning.

01:45:47.948 --> 01:45:49.677
But I can still...

01:45:51.719 --> 01:45:53.311
But, Stephen...

01:45:54.655 --> 01:45:55.644
No.

01:45:56.957 --> 01:46:00.154
I haven't seen the papers.
How could I up here?

01:46:13.707 --> 01:46:14.765
Yes.

01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:18.478
I'd rather you told me.

01:46:21.415 --> 01:46:22.882
Of course.

01:46:24.485 --> 01:46:27.010
I understand the position you're in.

01:46:33.627 --> 01:46:36.391
I hope you'll both be very happy.

01:46:39.633 --> 01:46:44.536
Me? No, I have no plans.

01:46:46.406 --> 01:46:48.033
No plans at all.

01:46:52.513 --> 01:46:54.606
Do you mind if I hang up now?

01:46:56.049 --> 01:46:58.711
Goodbye, Stephen.

01:47:01.388 --> 01:47:03.447
He married her, didn't he?

01:47:04.725 --> 01:47:05.749
Yes.

01:47:07.594 --> 01:47:09.255
This afternoon.

01:47:14.201 --> 01:47:16.761
I'm sorry I spoke so rough to you.

01:47:17.738 --> 01:47:19.672
It's all right, sister.

01:47:21.375 --> 01:47:23.036
It was a nice try.

01:47:30.617 --> 01:47:34.610
I don't know what I'm kicking about.
I still have my pride.

01:47:37.558 --> 01:47:40.322
Don't cry, honey.

01:47:42.362 --> 01:47:44.796
Come on, buck up.

01:48:00.447 --> 01:48:03.382
But <i>Madame</i> has been soaking
one whole hour.

01:48:03.817 --> 01:48:05.751
- So what?
<i>- Monsieur</i> thinks that...

01:48:05.819 --> 01:48:09.619
I told <i>Monsieur</i> the doctor ordered me
to soak in this foam for my nerves.

01:48:09.690 --> 01:48:11.419
What do you want?

01:48:11.491 --> 01:48:13.652
<i>Monsieur</i> suggests that you join him...

01:48:13.727 --> 01:48:16.252
...and walk Little Mary
to her mother's apartment.

01:48:16.330 --> 01:48:21.097
Holy mackerel, what a cheerful evening!
I'm so bored!

01:48:21.902 --> 01:48:24.063
<i>Monsieur</i> says that it doesn't improve...

01:48:24.137 --> 01:48:26.537
<i>...Madame's</i> nerves
to stay so long in the water.

01:48:26.607 --> 01:48:29.235
What'd he mean by that? A crack?

01:48:29.610 --> 01:48:31.942
No, he did not say it that way, <i>Madame.</i>

01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:34.540
I thought not.

01:48:34.615 --> 01:48:38.847
I've been Mrs. Haines for 18 months now
without a single squawk.

01:48:38.952 --> 01:48:42.012
That's some sort of a record
for Park Avenue.

01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:43.979
Get out.

01:48:44.358 --> 01:48:46.019
Get out! Go on!

01:48:48.595 --> 01:48:50.085
Hello, you.

01:48:51.531 --> 01:48:53.396
No, I'm in the tub.

01:48:54.635 --> 01:48:58.366
Yeah, and I'm shriveled to a peanut
waiting for this call.

01:48:59.172 --> 01:49:01.640
And say, listen,
don't call me anymore today.

01:49:01.708 --> 01:49:05.542
If there's any calling to be done,
I'll call you. It's safer.

01:49:05.746 --> 01:49:06.735
I know.

01:49:06.813 --> 01:49:10.374
When I had this phone put in here,
I thought I'd have a little privacy...

01:49:10.450 --> 01:49:15.410
...but the way people barge in and out,
you'd think it was Grand Central Station.

01:49:16.590 --> 01:49:17.750
What?

01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:23.491
Maybe it's a good thing
you're going to the Coast tomorrow.

01:49:23.897 --> 01:49:26.559
It's getting to be too risky.

01:49:28.902 --> 01:49:30.301
Say, listen.

01:49:30.604 --> 01:49:34.904
I've worked too hard to land
this meal ticket to make any false moves.

01:49:36.009 --> 01:49:37.374
Romance?

01:49:37.978 --> 01:49:40.412
Peace is a whole lot more to me
than any romance.

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:44.007
They're not going to get me
out on that limb again, ever!

01:49:45.252 --> 01:49:46.583
What?

01:49:49.289 --> 01:49:50.756
Sure, I'll miss you, baby.

01:49:51.358 --> 01:49:53.952
I'll miss you like nobody's business.

01:49:54.594 --> 01:49:56.528
I'll say, we had fun.

01:49:58.198 --> 01:49:59.995
I'll call you back.

01:50:02.536 --> 01:50:04.094
Who told you to come in here?

01:50:04.438 --> 01:50:08.272
Daddy. He's going to take me home now,
and I want to say good night.

01:50:08.342 --> 01:50:09.741
Don't go, darling.

01:50:11.945 --> 01:50:14.311
Hand me that sponge there, will you?

01:50:14.481 --> 01:50:16.608
- Please?
- Please.

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:21.446
Good night.

01:50:21.521 --> 01:50:24.388
You're in a hurry to tell Daddy about it,
aren't you?

01:50:24.458 --> 01:50:26.949
- About what?
- My talk on the telephone.

01:50:27.027 --> 01:50:29.860
I don't understand
grownups on the telephone.

01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:33.263
- They all sound silly. Good night.
- Good night, who?

01:50:37.671 --> 01:50:40.538
You've been told to call me Auntie Crystal.

01:50:40.974 --> 01:50:43.636
- Won't you do it?
- Yes.

01:50:44.344 --> 01:50:45.709
Yes, what?

01:50:46.646 --> 01:50:49.206
- Yes, good night.
- You sit down there.

01:50:50.517 --> 01:50:52.542
It's hot in here. I've got my coat on.

01:50:52.886 --> 01:50:55.878
You heard me, young lady.
I said, ''Sit <i>down''!</i>

01:50:56.723 --> 01:51:00.124
Now, we're going to have this out,
once and for all.

01:51:01.828 --> 01:51:05.423
I've done my best to be friends with you,
but you refuse to cooperate.

01:51:05.499 --> 01:51:07.660
- What?
- Cooperate!

01:51:09.636 --> 01:51:13.197
Now, answer my question.
You don't like me. Why?

01:51:16.176 --> 01:51:18.838
- Good night, Crystal.
- I said, ''Why? <i>''</i>

01:51:20.213 --> 01:51:23.478
Crystal, my mother told me
I wasn't to be rude to you.

01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:27.411
Young lady, you're going to give me
one good reason why you don't like me.

01:51:27.988 --> 01:51:29.683
I never said I didn't like you.

01:51:29.756 --> 01:51:33.283
- But you don't like me, do you?
- No, but I never said so.

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:37.121
I've been very polite,
considering you're something awful.

01:51:37.464 --> 01:51:39.762
Wait until your father hears about this!

01:51:40.767 --> 01:51:44.328
Listen, Daddy doesn't think
you're so wonderful anymore.

01:51:45.105 --> 01:51:48.734
- Did he tell you that?
- No. He always pretends you're all right.

01:51:48.809 --> 01:51:52.267
You wouldn't know about such things,
but my Daddy is a gentleman.

01:51:52.345 --> 01:51:55.337
He never talks against any woman,
not even you.

01:51:55.415 --> 01:51:59.818
But we understand, Daddy and I,
without ever saying a word to each other.

01:51:59.886 --> 01:52:02.411
I bet you've done plenty
of blabbing to your mother.

01:52:02.489 --> 01:52:06.550
No, I haven't. It's my job
to try and make Mother feel cheerful.

01:52:07.561 --> 01:52:10.553
Go on, get out of here.
Scram! On your way!

01:52:11.898 --> 01:52:16.062
And another thing. I think this bathroom
is perfectly ridiculous!

01:52:16.136 --> 01:52:17.967
Good night, Crystal.

01:52:19.573 --> 01:52:21.097
Why, <i>you...</i>

01:52:24.845 --> 01:52:26.437
I told you not to call me back here again.

01:52:26.513 --> 01:52:28.310
It's too dangerous.

01:52:28.582 --> 01:52:31.380
That little Haines brat was just in here.

01:52:31.852 --> 01:52:34.412
You've been drinking. Yes, you have!

01:52:34.488 --> 01:52:38.424
You're all lit up or you wouldn't want me
to be taking any chances either.

01:52:38.492 --> 01:52:41.188
- May I come in?
- Just a minute, Sylvia.

01:52:42.262 --> 01:52:43.524
Here comes more trouble.

01:52:43.597 --> 01:52:48.296
I'm going to hang up and don't you dare
call me here again! Do you understand?

01:52:50.070 --> 01:52:51.196
Come in, dear.

01:52:52.873 --> 01:52:55.103
I was out in the open when you called.

01:52:55.175 --> 01:52:58.110
- I hope you'll forgive me for being modest.
- You? Modest?

01:52:58.178 --> 01:53:02.114
I'll tell that to my psychoanalyst.
I have to tell him everything!

01:53:02.182 --> 01:53:04.343
That must be a great effort.

01:53:04.985 --> 01:53:07.010
I don't mind talking about myself...

01:53:07.087 --> 01:53:10.386
...but discussing my friends
does make me feel disloyal.

01:53:10.457 --> 01:53:13.221
I just saw poor Stephen
leaving with Little Mary.

01:53:13.293 --> 01:53:15.727
He looked awfully tired and worn.

01:53:15.829 --> 01:53:18.525
Dr. Sylvester says
Stephen has a guilt complex.

01:53:20.367 --> 01:53:21.527
A what?

01:53:21.735 --> 01:53:24.431
- Want me to scrub your back a bit, dear?
- Yeah.

01:53:24.971 --> 01:53:26.370
Here, hold this.

01:53:26.573 --> 01:53:28.939
Dr. Sylvester says that men like Steve
can't admit...

01:53:29.009 --> 01:53:31.239
...what they feel for a woman is not love.

01:53:31.311 --> 01:53:33.142
- You're taking my skin off!
- Sorry.

01:53:33.213 --> 01:53:35.272
He says that's why Stephen married you.

01:53:35.348 --> 01:53:39.284
To convince himself that your friendship
had dignity and importance.

01:53:39.352 --> 01:53:42.412
Who are you to laugh?
I've made good with my husband.

01:53:42.489 --> 01:53:44.684
That's how you talk
after all I've done for you?

01:53:44.758 --> 01:53:45.884
Done what?

01:53:45.959 --> 01:53:47.756
You knew no one
when you married Stephen.

01:53:47.827 --> 01:53:51.456
- It wasn't easy to put you over.
- And who said you put me over?

01:53:51.531 --> 01:53:53.795
I've gotten you into some
of our very best homes!

01:53:53.867 --> 01:53:56.665
Yes, for some of their very best insults.

01:54:01.007 --> 01:54:01.996
What?

01:54:02.075 --> 01:54:05.169
Who was Mrs. Buck Winston
before she married Buck Winston?

01:54:05.245 --> 01:54:09.841
<i>La Comtesse</i> De Lave. Imagine giving up
a title to marry that cowhand.

01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:12.680
I laugh every time I think
she got him into radio.

01:54:12.752 --> 01:54:15.619
My dear, he's positively
the chambermaid's delight!

01:54:17.057 --> 01:54:18.081
Is he?

01:54:18.358 --> 01:54:20.656
Mrs. Potter is on the phone
for you, Mrs. Fowler.

01:54:20.727 --> 01:54:22.558
I'll take it in here.

01:54:25.131 --> 01:54:27.326
But it's on the other phone, <i>Madame.</i>

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:28.831
Other phone?

01:54:29.903 --> 01:54:32.531
That charming little instrument
is not an extension?

01:54:32.606 --> 01:54:35.734
Stephen does so much business on
the other phone, I got my own.

01:54:35.809 --> 01:54:38.437
I'll bet that Stephen thinks
it's an extension.

01:54:38.511 --> 01:54:40.706
Stephen doesn't mooch
around my bathroom.

01:54:40.847 --> 01:54:44.408
- That's pretty obvious.
- Go on, answer the telephone.

01:54:45.518 --> 01:54:47.679
Tell her I'll call her back.

01:54:51.491 --> 01:54:54.221
Why, you sly little fox, you!

01:54:54.294 --> 01:54:57.525
This settles a question that's been
on my mind from the beginning.

01:54:57.597 --> 01:55:00.589
- What do you mean?
- You put that in here to talk to a man.

01:55:00.667 --> 01:55:02.225
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Don't lie!

01:55:02.302 --> 01:55:05.635
You're not Stephen's type.
I don't know why he picked you up.

01:55:05.705 --> 01:55:09.072
I've got to take a shower.
Wait for me in my bedroom.

01:55:11.344 --> 01:55:14.177
I used this cream. It brought out a rash.

01:55:14.781 --> 01:55:19.115
Don't you dare touch that telephone!
Give me that phone!

01:55:22.355 --> 01:55:24.050
What did he say?

01:55:24.624 --> 01:55:28.890
Not a thing. Not a single thing.
He was singing!

01:55:28.962 --> 01:55:30.691
All right. So what?

01:55:37.837 --> 01:55:39.270
How could you?

01:55:39.339 --> 01:55:43.400
Buck Winston, the chambermaid's delight!

01:55:44.444 --> 01:55:48.380
You haven't got a thing on me,
Sylvia Fowler. Not a single thing!

01:55:48.581 --> 01:55:52.176
Do I care? I'm mum as an oyster.
I don't want Stephen to find out.

01:55:52.252 --> 01:55:54.345
It would give Mary too much satisfaction.

01:55:54.421 --> 01:55:57.356
If you hang on to Stephen,
we'll both be happy.

01:55:57.457 --> 01:55:59.550
- Will you shake on that?
- Why not?

01:56:01.695 --> 01:56:02.218
Is the coast clear?

01:56:02.295 --> 01:56:05.492
All clear, Mrs. Morehead.
They're having a very gay dinner party.

01:56:07.033 --> 01:56:09.524
I'm still glad I went to the movies.
I'm starving. Those dreadful women!

01:56:09.602 --> 01:56:12.264
How my daughter can tolerate them,
I'll never understand.

01:56:12.339 --> 01:56:16.173
Mrs. Haines cooked for them in Reno,
the night she got her divorce, so she...

01:56:16.242 --> 01:56:18.506
So she feels she has to feed them annually.

01:56:18.578 --> 01:56:20.671
Did they bring
the same husbands this time?

01:56:20.747 --> 01:56:24.513
I guess so. They couldn't all
very well get new ones in two years.

01:56:24.584 --> 01:56:28.680
The approach of the innocents.
I leave you my share of them, Jane.

01:56:30.857 --> 01:56:33.291
Miriam, how's matrimony?
Still making a go of it?

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.954
My reconstruction job
on Howard Fowler would make...

01:56:36.029 --> 01:56:38.554
...the Boulder Dam look like an egg cup.

01:56:38.631 --> 01:56:42.829
Can't we get off to the Casino Roof?
Johnny and I have to be home by 4:00.

01:56:42.902 --> 01:56:46.861
Little Johnny always wakes up.
He said the cutest thing the other day.

01:56:47.073 --> 01:56:48.597
He said, ''Dada.''

01:56:48.675 --> 01:56:50.802
When does he enter college?

01:56:51.344 --> 01:56:54.040
- Where's Flora?
- She's at the bar, drinking with the men.

01:56:54.114 --> 01:56:55.911
Tell her you want to get going.

01:56:55.982 --> 01:56:59.611
What's the hurry? One more drink
and Flora will float up on her own breath.

01:56:59.686 --> 01:57:02.553
Do you want to hear something
about Sylvia?

01:57:02.756 --> 01:57:06.123
She's going to that new psychoanalyst.
You know, Dr. Sylvester.

01:57:06.192 --> 01:57:09.787
- Why, he's a dreadful fake!
- Isn't it a scream? She's mad about him!

01:57:09.863 --> 01:57:12.661
Do you know what she pays an hour
just to drool at him?

01:57:12.732 --> 01:57:15.326
- $100.
- It's worth $1 million!

01:57:15.402 --> 01:57:17.427
You should make up with Sylvia.

01:57:17.504 --> 01:57:19.938
She's livid at how
you've high-hatted her since Reno.

01:57:20.006 --> 01:57:22.167
I'd rather have her for a friend
than an enemy.

01:57:22.242 --> 01:57:23.641
I wouldn't.

01:57:24.611 --> 01:57:29.071
<i>Quelle soirée!</i> What a lovely party!

01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:35.944
Isn't it wonderful to see all our lives
so settled, temporarily?

01:57:36.122 --> 01:57:39.250
Do put that poor darling Freddy
out of his misery.

01:57:39.426 --> 01:57:41.792
- How, shoot him?
- Marry him, dear.

01:57:41.861 --> 01:57:43.385
<i>L'amour, I'amour.</i>

01:57:43.463 --> 01:57:46.762
- I'll get your wrap. Which one?
- I don't think I'll be going.

01:57:46.833 --> 01:57:48.664
But why?

01:57:49.636 --> 01:57:53.197
You're not cross because my Buck's
had a wee drop too much?

01:57:53.273 --> 01:57:56.299
Don't be modest, Flora.
Your ducky is stinko.

01:57:56.476 --> 01:57:59.104
Do come. This is really our farewell party.

01:57:59.179 --> 01:58:03.206
- I'm never coming back to New York.
- What's wrong with New York?

01:58:03.483 --> 01:58:06.680
- Can I trust you?
- Probably not, dear. What is it?

01:58:12.859 --> 01:58:15.555
Can we keep this between the five of us?

01:58:16.262 --> 01:58:19.754
- The six of us.
- Shoot. It's a nationwide hookup.

01:58:20.567 --> 01:58:24.503
You remember the way Buck
was always crooning love songs in my ear?

01:58:24.571 --> 01:58:25.936
He doesn't do it anymore.

01:58:26.005 --> 01:58:28.269
Maybe he's saving himself
for the microphone.

01:58:28.341 --> 01:58:31.208
No, he isn't. He stays away
from home most of the time...

01:58:31.277 --> 01:58:34.110
...and comes back smelling
of some strange perfume.

01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:37.638
- Where does he say he's been?
- Visiting his horse.

01:58:38.318 --> 01:58:40.616
That's why it's safer
to keep floating around.

01:58:40.687 --> 01:58:43.212
- Poor Flora.
- Never mind, dear. Chin up!

01:58:43.923 --> 01:58:46.084
That's right, both of them.

01:58:46.759 --> 01:58:48.693
Good night.

01:58:48.761 --> 01:58:53.357
I went up against a tribe of headhunters
in Africa, so I can take anything.

01:58:54.367 --> 01:58:55.800
Good night, precious.

01:58:55.869 --> 01:58:58.394
Since you're not going, I can tell you.

01:58:58.471 --> 01:59:01.804
You'd have run right smack
into Stephen and Crystal and Sylvia.

01:59:01.875 --> 01:59:04.241
They're having supper at the Casino Roof.

01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:07.108
- You'd have let it happen?
- They've got to meet sometime.

01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:11.116
- Why not get it over with?
- You know Mary hates situations.

01:59:11.184 --> 01:59:12.515
I'm not so squeamish.

01:59:12.585 --> 01:59:17.818
Wait till you see the cooing fest I put on
over Howard for dear, darling little Sylvia.

01:59:18.057 --> 01:59:20.651
Good night, Mary darling.

01:59:20.727 --> 01:59:23.662
I don't feel very much like going myself.
I hate this dress.

01:59:23.730 --> 01:59:26.790
My husband says I look
as though I were going to sing in it.

01:59:26.866 --> 01:59:29.994
- Good night.
- My love to little Johnny.

01:59:30.069 --> 01:59:33.300
So long, darling.
Shall I spit in Crystal's eye for you?

01:59:33.373 --> 01:59:37.935
You're passing up a swell chance, honey.
Where I spit, no grass grows ever!

01:59:46.586 --> 01:59:48.713
- What are you doing?
- Fumigating!

01:59:49.055 --> 01:59:50.079
Mother.

01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:54.087
How do you stand those dreadful women,
even once a year?

01:59:54.193 --> 01:59:55.387
An object lesson.

01:59:55.461 --> 01:59:58.726
- Would you like me to help you, ma'am?
- No, thanks. You go to bed.

01:59:58.798 --> 02:00:00.060
Good night, ma'am.

02:00:00.133 --> 02:00:02.260
Good night, Mrs. Morehead.

02:00:02.902 --> 02:00:05.063
- Good book?
- I think so.

02:00:05.672 --> 02:00:07.731
It seems to be about love.

02:00:08.408 --> 02:00:11.707
- I wish you could find...
- ''Some nice <i>man.''</i>

02:00:12.545 --> 02:00:15.480
Haven't we been
over that enough times, dear?

02:00:15.582 --> 02:00:18.016
I had the only one I ever wanted.

02:00:18.985 --> 02:00:21.453
If it hadn't been for my <i>pride...</i>

02:00:22.689 --> 02:00:26.250
But Stephen is happy, dear.
Why can't you forget him?

02:00:26.326 --> 02:00:27.623
Now, Mother.

02:00:27.894 --> 02:00:30.385
Cheer up.
Living alone has its compensations.

02:00:30.463 --> 02:00:33.796
It's marvelous to be able
to spread out in bed like a swastika.

02:00:33.866 --> 02:00:36.596
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, darling.

02:00:36.669 --> 02:00:39.638
And don't read too long.
It'll hurt your eyes.

02:01:09.836 --> 02:01:12.805
''But if you would seek
only love's pleasure...

02:01:13.773 --> 02:01:18.767
<i>''...then</i> it is better for you to pass out
of love's domain into the outside world...

02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:24.209
''...where you shall laugh,
but not all of your laughter...

02:01:25.451 --> 02:01:27.078
<i>''...and</i> weep...

02:01:27.654 --> 02:01:29.986
<i>''...but</i> not all of your <i>tears.''</i>

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:35.154
Mother.

02:01:38.831 --> 02:01:40.958
What's the matter, darling?

02:01:42.669 --> 02:01:44.569
May I crawl in with you tonight?

02:01:44.637 --> 02:01:47.834
Yes, but I'm so restless.
I'm apt to keep you awake, honey.

02:01:47.907 --> 02:01:50.375
- I don't mind.
- Come on, jump in then.

02:01:52.612 --> 02:01:54.876
That's the only good thing about divorce.

02:01:54.947 --> 02:01:57.415
You get to sleep with your mother.

02:01:57.717 --> 02:02:00.880
- I taste lipstick.
- I haven't washed yet.

02:02:01.754 --> 02:02:03.312
Good night, darling.

02:02:03.389 --> 02:02:06.187
You know,
you're a very sympathetic mother.

02:02:06.259 --> 02:02:08.557
- Am I?
- Yes.

02:02:08.628 --> 02:02:10.858
So would you scratch my back?

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.798
All right, but go to sleep.

02:02:17.503 --> 02:02:21.371
- I can't go to sleep.
- Yes, you can, if you try. Good night.

02:02:21.941 --> 02:02:24.842
No, I can't. I have such a big problem.

02:02:25.645 --> 02:02:26.839
Have you?

02:02:27.246 --> 02:02:30.738
Which is the most important,
truth or honor?

02:02:30.817 --> 02:02:34.344
They're equally important, darling.
One doesn't exist without the other.

02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:36.980
Yes, it does. It does with Daddy.

02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:39.984
You see, tonight Daddy told me a lie.

02:02:41.127 --> 02:02:43.527
- I don't think he did.
- Yes, he did.

02:02:43.596 --> 02:02:47.930
He did it for an honorable reason,
but he shouldn't lie to me...

02:02:48.134 --> 02:02:49.658
...even to save her skin.

02:02:49.736 --> 02:02:51.465
- To save whose skin?
- Crystal's.

02:02:51.537 --> 02:02:54.938
Walking home tonight,
Daddy said he was going up to Canada...

02:02:55.274 --> 02:02:57.834
...where you and he had your honeymoon.

02:02:57.910 --> 02:03:02.609
So I thought it was about time he stopped
pretending to me that he likes Crystal.

02:03:03.883 --> 02:03:07.375
- But he does like her very much, dear.
- That's what he lets on.

02:03:07.453 --> 02:03:10.115
If he'd only break down
and say he's going up there...

02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:13.317
...because he simply can't bear her
another day.

02:03:13.559 --> 02:03:16.084
- Why, Mary!
- He's so miserable.

02:03:16.496 --> 02:03:21.490
He sits for hours all alone in his study,
with his head buried in his hands...

02:03:21.567 --> 02:03:25.367
...while that silly thing plays solitaire
with the radio on.

02:03:26.572 --> 02:03:28.904
Why haven't you told me
about Daddy before?

02:03:28.975 --> 02:03:32.035
Because you've cried over him
just about enough.

02:03:33.412 --> 02:03:35.937
- Please keep on scratching.
- Sorry.

02:03:36.415 --> 02:03:39.350
I told Daddy tonight
I was going to tell you.

02:03:39.485 --> 02:03:40.918
And what did he say?

02:03:40.987 --> 02:03:44.388
He said not to because
why would you care how he feels.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.197
- Is Crystal happy, do you think?
- I suppose she is.

02:03:57.904 --> 02:04:01.601
She's got somebody she talks to
lovey-dovey on the phone.

02:04:02.642 --> 02:04:04.906
Don't stop scratching, Mother.

02:04:08.748 --> 02:04:11.546
- Do you know who it is?
- No, I don't know.

02:04:12.652 --> 02:04:17.351
Guess you'd have to ask Auntie Sylvia.
They're together all the time.

02:04:21.294 --> 02:04:24.593
- What are you doing?
- Go to sleep, darling.

02:04:24.664 --> 02:04:26.894
- Are you getting dressed?
- Yes.

02:04:26.966 --> 02:04:30.129
- You forgot you were invited to a party?
- Almost.

02:04:31.337 --> 02:04:34.500
- Are you ill, dear? You rang.
- I never felt better in my life.

02:04:34.574 --> 02:04:35.802
- Did you ring?
- Yes.

02:04:35.875 --> 02:04:38.742
My new evening wrap and a taxi!
Don't stand there! Hurry!

02:04:38.811 --> 02:04:41.006
Mary Haines, what is all this?

02:04:41.747 --> 02:04:44.545
I've had two years to grow claws, Mother.

02:04:44.617 --> 02:04:46.175
Jungle Red!

02:05:01.734 --> 02:05:04.635
Did you see those quaint types
with the Vanderheisens?

02:05:04.704 --> 02:05:07.730
Yes. What filthy-looking outsiders!
Who are they?

02:05:07.807 --> 02:05:09.638
I wouldn't admit it if I knew, pet.

02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:13.110
Really, something ought to be done
to protect New York.

02:05:13.779 --> 02:05:17.078
Are you sure Mrs. Fowler
didn't leave the restaurant before I came?

02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:19.344
- I'm sure.
- You know her by sight, don't you?

02:05:19.418 --> 02:05:23.184
She's famous for the size of her tips.
Not even a thin dime.

02:05:23.389 --> 02:05:26.449
But it's getting late.
Maybe she's decided not to come.

02:05:26.692 --> 02:05:28.523
Yes, maybe. Thank you.

02:05:28.995 --> 02:05:32.294
It's one thing to come out,
but quite another to go under the table.

02:05:32.365 --> 02:05:35.926
Don't think I didn't hear that Princeton boy
call me an old drizzle-puss.

02:05:36.002 --> 02:05:37.629
Try these smelling salts.

02:05:37.703 --> 02:05:40.501
Please come back out.
You've been in here over an hour.

02:05:40.573 --> 02:05:42.564
- Have I?
- Are you waiting for someone?

02:05:42.642 --> 02:05:44.303
No, I have sort of a headache.

02:05:44.377 --> 02:05:46.937
You're not going to get rid of it
in this bad air.

02:05:47.013 --> 02:05:49.072
No, perhaps you're right.

02:05:49.582 --> 02:05:51.982
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

02:05:53.786 --> 02:05:56.346
- Stephen is in such a mood.
- lx-nay.

02:05:57.924 --> 02:05:59.789
How do you do?

02:06:01.494 --> 02:06:03.018
Hello, Peggy.

02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:10.667
Stephen is going to give me pearls
for my birthday. Isn't that sweet?

02:06:10.736 --> 02:06:14.331
You have me to thank for those, dear.
I told him you'd love them.

02:06:14.407 --> 02:06:15.840
Thank you, darling.

02:06:16.008 --> 02:06:17.566
I beg your pardon.

02:06:18.144 --> 02:06:20.203
- Come on.
- I have to fix my makeup.

02:06:20.279 --> 02:06:23.009
- Hurry up before they come back.
- Leave me alone.

02:06:23.082 --> 02:06:24.379
Why, Mary!

02:06:24.750 --> 02:06:29.210
So he says, <i>''I</i> got to go home on <i>Sunday.''</i>
So I said, ''Why do you got to? <i>''</i>

02:06:29.288 --> 02:06:32.121
He says, ''They always expect me home
on Easter <i>Sunday.''</i>

02:06:32.191 --> 02:06:34.716
I said, ''What do they expect you to do,
lay an egg? <i>''</i>

02:06:34.794 --> 02:06:36.591
What are you up to?

02:06:38.831 --> 02:06:41.391
Did I tell you I'm going to Dr. Sylvester?

02:06:41.467 --> 02:06:44.766
My dear, he keeps me for hours
and never sends me a bill.

02:06:44.837 --> 02:06:47.362
He tells me the pleasure is all his.

02:06:51.077 --> 02:06:54.376
You've never been
to Dr. Sylvester in your life!

02:06:57.883 --> 02:07:00.113
You still here, Mary?

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:03.447
I've got stocking trouble.

02:07:04.924 --> 02:07:06.221
What a bore.

02:07:06.292 --> 02:07:08.658
- How have you been feeling?
- Quite well.

02:07:08.728 --> 02:07:11.697
I just heard you say
you'd been to the doctor.

02:07:12.365 --> 02:07:13.457
Jealous?

02:07:13.532 --> 02:07:16.057
Don't be silly.
I'm not interested in Dr. Sylvester.

02:07:16.135 --> 02:07:17.693
Dolly Dupuyster!

02:07:17.770 --> 02:07:22.070
Hello, girls. My, but you look lovely.
Got any dirt for the column?

02:07:22.141 --> 02:07:23.904
Not a thing, sweet.

02:07:23.976 --> 02:07:26.672
No? Get me my coat, Sadie.
I might as well shove off.

02:07:26.746 --> 02:07:29.647
- I've never seen such a clean joint.
- Don't be coy.

02:07:29.715 --> 02:07:33.412
It's all over town what a fool you're making
of yourself over Dr. Sylvester.

02:07:33.486 --> 02:07:36.250
Just a minute!
I'd thank you to explain that last crack.

02:07:36.322 --> 02:07:37.448
Girls, Dolly Dupuyster!

02:07:37.523 --> 02:07:40.219
You're paying him $100 an hour
just to hold your hand.

02:07:40.292 --> 02:07:42.453
- Did he tell you that?
- Of course not.

02:07:42.528 --> 02:07:44.826
He never discusses his patients.

02:07:44.897 --> 02:07:47.092
- You aren't feeling well.
- Yes, I am.

02:07:47.166 --> 02:07:48.394
I'm going to get Nancy.

02:07:48.467 --> 02:07:51.925
I haven't seen you for two years.
Where do you get your information?

02:07:52.004 --> 02:07:53.301
Where do you suppose?

02:07:53.372 --> 02:07:57.138
- Where?
- From Crystal.

02:07:59.945 --> 02:08:01.310
Why, <i>you...</i>

02:08:05.785 --> 02:08:10.085
Of course. By way of every saleswoman
and manicurist in New York.

02:08:13.726 --> 02:08:16.889
She's now telling that
he had to grow a Vandyke beard...

02:08:16.962 --> 02:08:19.328
...so you can't see him laughing at you.

02:08:19.398 --> 02:08:22.299
The rotten <i>little...</i> I'll slit her throat!

02:08:22.435 --> 02:08:26.633
You're the only friend she's got.
Who else can she gossip about?

02:08:26.705 --> 02:08:29.902
She's got Buck Winston!
Why can't she tell about him?

02:08:29.975 --> 02:08:31.465
Buck Winston!

02:08:32.845 --> 02:08:35.336
Why, Mary Haines!
You fished that out of me!

02:08:35.414 --> 02:08:38.178
- Good night, girls.
- Dolly, stick around!

02:08:38.751 --> 02:08:40.844
- Something's going to pop.
- Good and dirty?

02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:44.481
Go and ask Buck Winston what famous
society matron is crazy about him.

02:08:44.557 --> 02:08:46.752
Oh, boy, dirt! Out of my way!

02:08:46.892 --> 02:08:50.760
Why, you! I'll shut Buck Winston's trap
if it's the last act of my life.

02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:54.163
No, you won't. You're going to stay here.
Stop her, girls!

02:08:54.233 --> 02:08:57.498
- Where were you going, my pretty maid?
- Peggy, lock the door.

02:08:57.570 --> 02:09:00.539
- Any place we can lock her up?
- In the closet.

02:09:00.806 --> 02:09:03.172
- Mary dear, I'll stay here.
- You bet you will.

02:09:03.242 --> 02:09:05.506
You'd better think of your job,
my good woman.

02:09:05.578 --> 02:09:07.739
I'm thinking of the tips you never gave me.

02:09:07.813 --> 02:09:10.805
- This isn't like you.
- I haven't even started yet.

02:09:10.883 --> 02:09:14.080
- Whatever you're up to, I'm for it.
- Go and unlock the door.

02:09:15.988 --> 02:09:18.786
- Who locked that door?
- I'm sorry, ma'am. It got stuck.

02:09:19.925 --> 02:09:21.984
- Come out, quick! All heck's broken loose!
- Of course it has.

02:09:22.228 --> 02:09:24.924
Buck Winston just spilled
the most terrific load of dirt.

02:09:24.997 --> 02:09:27.158
Stephen had to knock him cold
to shut his trap.

02:09:27.233 --> 02:09:31.329
- And the joint's full of newspaper cameras.
- I knew Dolly could do it!

02:09:31.403 --> 02:09:33.598
Go out there and reconnoiter.

02:09:36.308 --> 02:09:38.674
How could Buck have done that to me?

02:09:38.744 --> 02:09:42.373
The Dr. Jekyll and The Mr. Hyde!
Which was which?

02:09:42.448 --> 02:09:44.040
Now, Flora, calm down.

02:09:44.116 --> 02:09:49.110
Of all five husbands,
Buck is the first one to insult me in public.

02:09:51.457 --> 02:09:52.856
Poor Flora.

02:09:53.559 --> 02:09:54.617
What did he do?

02:09:54.693 --> 02:09:57.628
Do? He confessed an undying love
for little Crystal.

02:09:57.696 --> 02:09:59.425
To Dolly Dupuyster, no less.

02:09:59.732 --> 02:10:03.031
So that everybody in the place
could hear him.

02:10:03.502 --> 02:10:05.367
Oh, the publicity!

02:10:05.604 --> 02:10:08.129
<i>La publicité!</i>

02:10:08.574 --> 02:10:12.772
- He even spilled dates and addresses.
- Don't worry, I jotted them all down.

02:10:12.845 --> 02:10:15.871
He said he'd be a cock-eyed coyote...

02:10:15.948 --> 02:10:20.408
...before he'd herd an old beef like me
back to the Coast.

02:10:22.521 --> 02:10:26.480
Get me a bromide. And put some gin in it.

02:10:29.762 --> 02:10:32.458
Hey, you! Is Mrs. Fowler in here?

02:10:32.865 --> 02:10:34.298
And how!

02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:36.026
Open it up, Sadie.

02:10:38.604 --> 02:10:42.335
I'll sue, that's what I'll do.
I'll sue everybody in this place.

02:10:43.509 --> 02:10:46.444
It's kidnapping, that's what it is.
It's kidnapping!

02:10:46.712 --> 02:10:48.737
You've been shooting off
your mouth, you rat!

02:10:48.814 --> 02:10:51.112
I didn't say a word. Mary got it out of me!

02:10:51.517 --> 02:10:53.178
It wasn't hard to do.

02:10:53.419 --> 02:10:57.048
Why, you rotten <i>little...</i>
Just wait till I start talking about you.

02:10:57.122 --> 02:10:58.282
You can't say a thing!

02:10:58.357 --> 02:11:01.986
And besides, I knew you'd lose
Stephen Haines, you shopgirl.

02:11:03.128 --> 02:11:05.756
You're trying to break up my marriage,
you cats!

02:11:05.831 --> 02:11:07.355
But get this straight.

02:11:07.433 --> 02:11:10.732
You can't stampede me by gossip
or the ravings of Buck Winston.

02:11:10.803 --> 02:11:13.431
You've got to have evidence.
And Stephen is a gentleman.

02:11:13.505 --> 02:11:15.905
He doesn't need it outside New York.

02:11:15.975 --> 02:11:18.205
He's fed up with you.
In your heart, you know it.

02:11:18.277 --> 02:11:21.007
Take my advice.
Put your mind on your alimony.

02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:24.811
Alimony? With what Stephen has on you,
he won't have to give you a dime.

02:11:24.883 --> 02:11:26.316
Is that so?

02:11:26.819 --> 02:11:29.811
What if I don't need alimony?
How would you like that?

02:11:29.888 --> 02:11:32.288
- You don't?
- What are you going to use instead?

02:11:32.358 --> 02:11:33.586
Buck Winston.

02:11:34.593 --> 02:11:36.060
The ingrate!

02:11:36.295 --> 02:11:39.287
Your cowboy and I get along great,
Countess. Just great.

02:11:39.365 --> 02:11:43.301
And the dough he earns on the radio
is more than Stephen will ever dig up.

02:11:43.369 --> 02:11:45.735
Buck and I are tickled to death
to be rid of you.

02:11:45.804 --> 02:11:47.203
The ingrate!

02:11:47.273 --> 02:11:49.798
Cheer up. This is a new lesson in <i>amour.</i>

02:11:49.875 --> 02:11:54.141
That's right. See to it that your
next husband isn't financially independent.

02:11:54.213 --> 02:11:55.578
Buck isn't independent.

02:11:55.648 --> 02:11:57.843
Hasn't he a contract with Dandy Gelatine?

02:11:57.916 --> 02:12:01.443
No, darling. I am Dandy Gelatine.

02:12:02.588 --> 02:12:06.046
Nobody would give Buck a job
on the radio, the old meanies...

02:12:06.392 --> 02:12:09.054
...so I had to buy out Dandy Gelatine.

02:12:14.233 --> 02:12:18.135
You can buy it now, dear,
and give Buck away with every package.

02:12:20.139 --> 02:12:24.235
Girls, looks like it's back
to the perfume counter for me.

02:12:25.544 --> 02:12:28.536
And by the way,
there's a name for you ladies...

02:12:28.614 --> 02:12:32.072
...but it isn't used in high society,
outside of a kennel.

02:12:32.284 --> 02:12:33.273
So long, ladies.

02:12:33.352 --> 02:12:36.810
Mary, Stephen is outside.
He's waiting for you.

02:12:36.889 --> 02:12:40.154
He wants to know if you'll see him.
Will you, please?

02:12:40.426 --> 02:12:43.156
Will I? You bet I will!

02:12:44.063 --> 02:12:47.897
- Mary Haines, haven't you any pride?
- No pride at all.

02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:51.062
That's a luxury women in love can't afford.
