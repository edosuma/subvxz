02:12.757 --> 02:14.800
Well, lookie here.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.223
Lindsey?

05:43.551 --> 05:45.719
Megan!

05:46.012 --> 05:48.012
Lindsey?

06:43.277 --> 06:44.611
Megan.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.608
Help me put up the tent.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.238
It's unfair!

07:38.708 --> 07:41.501
Those sow-wallowing monkeys' asses.

08:43.313 --> 08:47.692
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.112
But I do want.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.950
He leadeth me beside still waters.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.744
He restoreth my soul.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.039
But they killed my dog.

09:03.626 --> 09:07.128
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

09:07.296 --> 09:09.589
I shall fear no evil.

09:09.757 --> 09:12.175
But I am afraid.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.470
For thou art with me.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.015
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.519
But we need a miracle.

09:27.024 --> 09:30.193
Thy loving kindness and mercy...

09:30.361 --> 09:33.530
shall follow me all the days of my life.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.825
If you exist.

09:39.328 --> 09:42.998
And I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

09:45.751 --> 09:49.170
But I'd like to get
more out of this life first.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.841
If you don't help us...

09:53.426 --> 09:55.760
we're all gonna die.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.807
Please?

10:02.226 --> 10:04.603
Just one miracle?

10:09.025 --> 10:10.692
Amen.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.902
Quitting, Mr. Barret?

10:54.195 --> 10:56.488
I'm not quitting, Eddie,
just going into town.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.699
Well, ain't that kind of dumb, Mr. Barret?

10:59.867 --> 11:02.410
You remember what happened
to you last time.

11:09.251 --> 11:13.129
- Are you quitting, Mr. Barret?
- Just going to town, Teddy.

11:13.297 --> 11:16.174
Ain't that kind of dumb
after what happened last time?

11:54.171 --> 11:55.505
It's Barret.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.174
Good afternoon, Mrs. B.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.551
- Well, Hull.
- Mr. B.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.511
Damn fool.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.389
Couldn't you wait
till the smoke cleared away?

12:46.557 --> 12:49.517
We seem to need a few supplies.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.395
All new camp, the way I hear it.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.649
You got sand, boy, but you ain't got
the sense God gave a sack of beans.

12:56.817 --> 13:00.195
Yeah, well, we don't have much choice.
They ruined the McPherson shack.

13:00.362 --> 13:04.991
Bust up a couple others. If it's gonna
snow, the children'll catch their deaths.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.453
Clarence. Go on.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.375
I expect you're gonna pay
for all this in gold, right?

13:15.753 --> 13:18.713
Yep. Soon as I put together
a couple ounces, I'll bring them in.

13:19.632 --> 13:24.594
It'll take a damn sight more than a couple
ounces. Mother, throw me that ledger.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.263
The last payment you folks made...

13:27.431 --> 13:31.392
was eight months ago,
when old Lindquist brought his dust in.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.728
There ain't no color left in Carbon Creek.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.523
If there wasn't, why is LaHood
set on driving us out?

13:36.690 --> 13:38.733
Maybe he ain't used to being said no to.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.735
Oh, there's color. There's nuggets too.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.530
Spider panned one out this morning
big as your thumbnail.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.573
Spider Conway?
Tell that son of a bitch...

13:45.741 --> 13:49.577
I got him down here for $85.33.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.997
Forty-three cents.
He wants some cyanide to bleach his dust.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.666
Oh, that tears it.

13:54.834 --> 13:59.420
You tell Spider and the rest of them
that this is the end of the line.

13:59.588 --> 14:02.215
The tit's gone dry.
No more credit, you hear?

14:02.383 --> 14:05.927
You're a decent man and,
you know, I...

14:06.095 --> 14:08.263
Well, we're all grateful
for what you've done.

14:08.430 --> 14:12.308
Don't coddle me, son.
I ain't doing this for you.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.520
Hell, I'm the only merchant in town
LaHood doesn't own.

14:16.772 --> 14:20.441
It does my soul good
to see a few extra thorns in his side.

14:20.609 --> 14:26.281
One day we'll strike it big. And
when we do, I'll pay you off myself.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.366
With interest, Mrs. B.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.076
Barret...

14:31.161 --> 14:33.705
you just get your goods
in that wagon and skedaddle.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.292
Just keep moving no matter
what they say, all right?

14:37.459 --> 14:40.920
- So long.
- You take care, Hull.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.404
We got a beef with you, Barret.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.326
When we rode through the canyon,
you plumb forgot to say hello.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.786
Told you to stay out of town
a while back too.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.497
When he kicked your head,
it must've jarred your memory.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.292
Kick him again,
and maybe it'll come back.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.628
Tell us about your Wheeler women, Barret.

15:21.795 --> 15:24.172
Now, are you humping
just the growed one or both?

15:25.674 --> 15:28.217
Probably both at the same time.

15:29.011 --> 15:32.013
I mean, that little one,
she's just out of knickers, ain't she?

15:32.181 --> 15:35.934
Yeah. I'll bet you she's about
as juicy as a freshwater clam.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.770
What does it take to get you
to fight like a man anyway?

15:40.272 --> 15:43.733
- I didn't come here to fight.
- Then you shouldn't have come here at all.

15:43.901 --> 15:47.820
You made a big mistake, tin pan.
You know that?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.658
Mind if I take a look at your goods?

15:52.910 --> 15:53.993
You leave them be.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.663
Come on down off of there.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.209
How you like that, panner?

16:05.881 --> 16:07.423
God.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.551
Get out of there. Get out of there.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.565
Canvas, burlap and wood.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.901
Looks like the makings for a good fire,
right?

16:27.069 --> 16:28.403
Yeah.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.828
You shouldn't play with matches.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.258
Goddamn.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.473
There's nothing like
a nice piece of hickory.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.146
Much obliged.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.665
Damn.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.004
Go on.

18:52.172 --> 18:55.133
Hey... Hey, there.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.970
Hey, there, Hull Barret's my name.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.639
- You from hereabouts?
- Nope.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.351
- Are you just passing through?
- I hadn't really thought about it.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.980
After what you did back there,
I wouldn't stay in town if I were you.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.233
My cabin has two rooms.
You're welcome to one of them, if you like.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.570
I wouldn't wanna be a burden
on you or your family.

19:15.737 --> 19:19.365
Well, all I got is a
kind of fiancÃ©e, is all.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.952
But it'd be a pleasure, not a burden.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.247
Three hots and a cot,
it's the least I owe you.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.182
- So long, Hull.
- Where you going, Ulrik?

19:44.349 --> 19:46.100
Going. Getting out.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.727
Where the hell to?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.688
Away. Can't fight no more.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.357
I'm not the only one either.

19:54.067 --> 19:57.945
Good luck, Hull Barret.
You'll quit too, if you're smart.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.370
Come on, Wilson. Come on.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.378
"And power was given to him that sat
thereon to take peace from the earth..."

20:14.796 --> 20:19.217
and that they should kill one another.
There was given unto him a great sword.

20:19.384 --> 20:23.429
And when he had opened the third seal, I
heard the third beast say, 'Come and see."'

20:23.597 --> 20:27.850
Very good.
Fetch me some butter and some syrup.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.772
"And I beheld, and lo, a black horse..."

20:32.940 --> 20:37.735
and he that sat on him had a pair of
balances in his hand. And I heard a voice...

20:37.903 --> 20:41.572
in the midst of the four beasts say,
'A measure of wheat for a penny...

20:41.740 --> 20:44.033
and three measures of barley
for a penny...

20:44.201 --> 20:47.745
and see thou hurt not
the oil and the wine.'

20:47.913 --> 20:51.874
And when he had opened the fourth seal,
I heard the voice of the fourth beast say:

20:52.042 --> 20:54.335
'Come and see.' And I looked...

20:54.503 --> 20:58.464
and behold a pale horse,
and his name that sat on him...

20:58.632 --> 21:00.466
was Death...

21:13.021 --> 21:14.855
"...and hell followed with him."

21:28.453 --> 21:30.746
Here's a towel for you.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.176
Dinner will be ready pretty soon.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.992
The way he waded into McGill and
his men, you should have seen him.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.954
Well, he sounds no different than McGill
or Tyson or any of LaHood's rough men.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.748
At least he wasn't afraid of them.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.334
That's what we need here,
someone they can't scare.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.586
You scared of them, Hull?

22:19.379 --> 22:22.923
Well, he should be.
But he's too all-fired stubborn.

22:23.091 --> 22:27.345
But I was scared and that's the point,
they knew it. LaHood's got us all scared.

22:28.388 --> 22:32.224
Lindquist left and he didn't
even know where he was going.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.852
"I'm just going," he said.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.397
The colony is beaten, Hull.
The only one who doesn't know it is you.

22:38.565 --> 22:42.234
And me. I'm not leaving until
LaHood's men are whipped. Every last one.

22:42.402 --> 22:45.071
Hush, Megan!
Now, see what you're doing, Hull Barret?

22:45.238 --> 22:48.032
You got her talking more like
your daughter than mine.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.910
Tell her this is nonsense,
this business about fighting.

22:51.078 --> 22:54.455
- Who said anything about fighting?
- You did, talking about this stranger.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.956
What is he, a gunman?

22:56.124 --> 23:00.461
I half hope he is. I'd sure chip in
an ounce of dust for a little protection.

23:00.629 --> 23:04.090
- From a hired killer?
- Who said he was a hired killer?

23:04.257 --> 23:05.549
Megan, we're going home.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.760
- Sarah, please.
- Then get rid of him.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.470
- I will. I promise I'll...
- Today.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.306
- No, right after supper.
- No, not after supper.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.225
- Now!
- Sarah, he saved my life.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.310
Good evening.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.567
Hope I'm not the cause
of all this excitement.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.662
Do you mind?

23:35.997 --> 23:37.957
Oh, go right ahead.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.669
There's nothing like a shot of whiskey...

23:42.879 --> 23:45.256
to whet a man's appetite.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.515
Fine looking fricassee there, ma'am.

23:55.183 --> 23:57.268
Don't want it to get cold.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.271
I apologize. I mean...

24:00.439 --> 24:02.231
I didn't realize...

24:02.399 --> 24:04.442
I'll be damned.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.862
Here, come right down here.

24:09.030 --> 24:12.867
And I'll get you some biscuits here.
There's your stew, some butter and syrup.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.327
Is there anything else you want?

24:15.495 --> 24:17.872
Just some company.
Aren't you gonna join me?

24:18.039 --> 24:21.167
- Ma? Hull?
- Well, of course.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.586
Well, how do you do?

24:23.753 --> 24:28.549
And thank you for helping
on Hull's behalf this morning.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.218
I'm Sarah Wheeler.

24:31.386 --> 24:34.430
- This is my daughter, Megan.
- Megan.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.057
I guess we kind of
got carried away there...

24:37.225 --> 24:40.519
but from the way you handled
those men, I never would have thought...

24:40.687 --> 24:42.563
Will you say grace?

24:43.940 --> 24:45.065
Certainly.

24:46.735 --> 24:50.779
For what we are about to receive,
may we be truly thankful.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.406
Amen.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.909
- Amen.
- Amen.

25:38.245 --> 25:42.081
- You should've started over an hour ago.
- I apologize, Josh.

25:42.249 --> 25:45.292
We'd have been here,
but we got tied up at the sawbones'.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.628
What the hell happened?

25:47.796 --> 25:52.049
Well, we had a little set-in with
Barret, boss. We's in town and...

25:52.217 --> 25:55.970
And you got whipped?
In LaHood, California, by a tin pan?

25:56.137 --> 25:59.181
Well, there was a stranger
who kind of give him a hand.

26:00.183 --> 26:03.143
- A stranger?
- A big guy.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.688
Who're you talking about?

26:05.939 --> 26:09.316
He left with Barret.
He didn't stick around to chat.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.862
McGill, take the sluice.

26:14.030 --> 26:18.325
- Jagou, Tyson, Elam, take over the monitor.
- Yes, sir.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.592
Club?

26:47.063 --> 26:50.566
This man, LaHood, I take it
he's the one you all are feuding with.

26:50.734 --> 26:54.612
Yeah, well, him and his son.
Old Coy LaHood, he's a powerful man.

26:54.779 --> 26:58.282
He come up here... I guess in '54 or '55,
I think it was.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.701
And he was the first man
to strike it rich.

27:00.869 --> 27:04.997
He saved himself a poke, then he'd
stake new claims and he'd mine them out...

27:05.165 --> 27:07.833
and then buy some more.
Last couple years...

27:08.001 --> 27:10.961
- ...he's been using big hydraulic monitors.
- Oh, yeah.

27:11.129 --> 27:15.049
They blast a place to hell.
Excuse my French.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.842
- Morning, Meg.
- Hello.

27:17.010 --> 27:20.054
- Good morning.
- LaHood's more powerful now than ever.

27:20.221 --> 27:23.223
But Carbon Canyon's the only place
his crew hasn't ruined yet.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.225
He's greedy for it too.

27:25.393 --> 27:27.770
Does he have any lawful rights
to your canyon here?

27:27.937 --> 27:32.441
Oh, no. My claim is filed in Sacramento.
Same as everybody else's.

27:32.609 --> 27:36.070
The only way LaHood can take
this land legally is if we leave it.

27:36.446 --> 27:39.239
I take it he's been kind of persuasive.

27:39.407 --> 27:42.159
I don't care if they all leave,
I'm staying here.

27:42.327 --> 27:45.120
He killed my dog and my Grandpa.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.292
Isn't there any law around,
someone you can take your case to?

27:50.460 --> 27:54.046
Even if there was, LaHood would own them
like he owns everything else.

27:54.214 --> 27:57.591
And there's not much a lawman could do
even if we had one.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.802
Because LaHood,
he ain't killed anyone yet.

27:59.969 --> 28:02.805
Meg's grandpa's heart gave out.

28:02.972 --> 28:07.559
I've been sort of taking care
of Sarah and Megan ever since.

28:08.269 --> 28:11.897
You know, it ain't that
we're living in sin...

28:12.482 --> 28:14.775
and it ain't that
I don't wanna marry her.

28:14.943 --> 28:18.112
It's just that, one day
a few years back, her husband...

28:18.279 --> 28:20.489
Megan's father, he lit out on her...

28:21.866 --> 28:23.784
and left her with a half-growed child.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.621
Since then, getting her trustful
of a man has been...

28:27.789 --> 28:30.874
Well, you know, it ain't been easy.

28:31.167 --> 28:33.961
But when we get hitched,
how about you doing the hitching?

28:36.089 --> 28:41.135
If you're waiting for a woman to make up
her mind, you may have a long wait.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.930
Yeah, I guess so.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.726
Meantime, why don't you put me to work?

28:48.893 --> 28:51.019
Oh, no, I couldn't ask you to...

28:51.187 --> 28:53.814
Well, I mean, maybe if
there was something spiritual.

28:53.982 --> 28:58.444
Well, spirit ain't worth spit without
a little exercise. Now, you tell me where.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.696
Yeah? Well, okay.

29:00.864 --> 29:05.117
You know, I always thought that
if I could split that rock there...

29:05.702 --> 29:07.619
and get to the gravel underneath...

29:07.787 --> 29:11.248
there's gold been waiting
since the beginning of time.

29:11.624 --> 29:16.837
Now, every morning for two years,
I've been coming out here, and you see...

29:17.005 --> 29:22.509
it's like this rock and me,
we have a kind of agreement.

29:22.677 --> 29:25.846
I'm gonna do it in
or it's gonna do me in.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.558
Well, I'd hate to lay odds
on who's gonna win.

29:29.809 --> 29:32.352
Yeah? Well...

29:32.520 --> 29:36.690
You know, I thought of drilling it and
blasting the son of a gun, but that would...

29:36.858 --> 29:40.319
- That would wreck the stream?
- Yeah. Dam it up, be the end of everything.

29:42.197 --> 29:47.201
Well, there's plain few problems can't be
solved with a little sweat and hard work.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.496
Hull? Mr. Preacher?

31:15.164 --> 31:17.207
Somebody's coming.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.806
You recognize them?

31:33.308 --> 31:36.059
The one on the left is LaHood's boy, Josh.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.103
The other one...

31:38.855 --> 31:41.398
I ain't never seen him before.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.777
Barret. Megan.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.408
A friend of yours, Barret?

31:53.745 --> 31:55.829
Yep. He's our new preacher.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.290
Preacher?

32:01.294 --> 32:03.754
I hear you messed up
some of my boys, preach.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.173
Nothing personal.

32:06.841 --> 32:11.261
I hope you won't take it personal when we tell
you to get the hell out of Carbon Canyon.

32:11.679 --> 32:14.348
Well, there's a lot of sinners hereabouts.

32:14.515 --> 32:17.601
You wouldn't want me to leave
before I finish my work, would you?

32:18.728 --> 32:20.395
Club.

33:07.694 --> 33:11.279
- Jesus.
- Your work done now, preacher?

33:15.201 --> 33:16.660
Part of it, leastways.

33:36.389 --> 33:39.099
All right. All right.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.268
Get up.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.941
Take it easy.

33:50.403 --> 33:53.697
Put it in a little ice,
and that'll take care of it.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.792
Thanks for stopping by, son.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.771
You think you can make it?

34:26.272 --> 34:29.149
Ice. Ice.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.578
Well, now...

34:41.746 --> 34:45.791
the Lord certainly does
work in mysterious ways.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.839
Preacher, my ass.

34:56.677 --> 34:58.637
- Hey, come on.
- Split it to hell.

36:05.746 --> 36:07.497
- Good day, Mr. LaHood.
- Whitey.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.374
- Watch that step, Mr. LaHood.
- Why?

36:09.542 --> 36:12.586
Damn thing move
since we left Sacramento?

36:14.422 --> 36:16.798
- Thank you, Mr. LaHood.
- Welcome home, Pop.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.717
- Morning, son. McGill.
- Boss.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.719
- How was Sacramento?
- Paradise.

36:20.887 --> 36:23.430
Two politicians
for every Chinese laundry...

36:23.598 --> 36:26.141
and two whores for every politician.

36:26.309 --> 36:30.187
If there was gold in the delta,
I'd go there. How's business?

36:30.354 --> 36:33.148
We're still pulling low-grade ore
out of number-five shaft...

36:33.316 --> 36:35.108
but that vein's about played out.

36:35.276 --> 36:39.529
We went another 20 foot down 12 shaft,
pulled nothing but manganite, shut it down.

36:39.697 --> 36:43.783
And that plaster vein in Cobalt Canyon
is wearing kind of thin too.

36:43.951 --> 36:45.535
What about Carbon?

36:45.703 --> 36:48.747
Well, we ran another raid through there
a few days back.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.041
Put a damn good scare into them,
didn't we?

36:51.209 --> 36:55.045
Yeah. We damn near run them out
this time, lock, stock and barrel.

37:00.718 --> 37:04.429
Seems a stranger sort of came through
and pulled them together.

37:04.597 --> 37:08.600
- Ain't that the way you see it, McGill?
- Yeah, he kind of pulled them together.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.269
This one stranger did that?

37:11.437 --> 37:15.357
Hell, I expect you boys didn't
explain to him just who we are.

37:15.524 --> 37:20.153
I expect that once you explain things
to him, he'll decide to move on.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.948
Yeah, there ain't much for
a preacher to do around here.

37:23.115 --> 37:26.618
A preacher?
You let a preacher into Carbon Canyon?

37:27.703 --> 37:31.581
We didn't invite him.
He took up with Hull.

37:31.749 --> 37:34.167
What the hell's wrong with
a preacher anyway?

37:34.752 --> 37:38.004
When I left for Sacramento,
those tin pans had all but given up.

37:38.172 --> 37:40.006
Their spirit was nearly broken.

37:40.174 --> 37:42.842
And a man without spirit is whipped.

37:43.010 --> 37:47.097
But a preacher, he could give them faith.

37:47.265 --> 37:52.686
Shit! One ounce of faith, they'll be dug
in deeper than ticks on a hound.

37:52.853 --> 37:58.191
You boys... You go throw a rope
around that man. You bring him to me.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.777
No, don't.

38:00.945 --> 38:05.699
If we get too rough, we'll make a martyr
out of him. Don't wanna give them a martyr.

38:06.075 --> 38:09.202
- That's true.
- You didn't get no help from Sacramento?

38:09.370 --> 38:12.497
Sacramento ain't worth moose piss!

38:13.749 --> 38:15.709
They didn't sign the writ, I take it.

38:15.876 --> 38:18.878
Not only that, some of them bastard...
Hold there.

38:19.046 --> 38:24.509
Some of them bastard politicians wanna
do away with hydraulic mining altogether.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.304
"Raping the land," they call it.

38:27.471 --> 38:32.267
We gotta move on Carbon,
and move fast and dig deep.

38:32.435 --> 38:36.896
The way the wind's blowing, in another
couple years, we may be out of business.

38:37.106 --> 38:39.983
And those tin pans have gotta go.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.360
And that preacher.

38:43.070 --> 38:46.031
We'll have to find a way to deal with him.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.120
Were Grandma and Grandpa happy
when you got married, Ma?

38:52.288 --> 38:56.249
I'm afraid they didn't have
a thimbleful of choice in the matter.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.293
Were they surprised?

38:58.461 --> 39:01.755
Your grandpa took the measles,
and your grandma got drunk.

39:01.922 --> 39:04.966
I suppose you could say
it surprised them some.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.177
Because they thought
you weren't old enough?

39:07.345 --> 39:10.513
Your grandma was 15
when she got married.

39:10.681 --> 39:15.060
No, I think what riled them
was who I married.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.396
Think you'll be happy married to Hull?

39:19.607 --> 39:21.399
Who says I'm marrying Hull?

39:21.734 --> 39:24.110
Hull's nice enough, isn't he?

39:25.780 --> 39:27.197
Yes.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.366
He's nice.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.412
Do preachers get married?

39:37.625 --> 39:40.085
I don't see why not.

39:42.755 --> 39:44.589
How do I look?

39:46.675 --> 39:49.010
You look lovely.

39:50.596 --> 39:52.472
You are the prettiest daughter...

39:53.140 --> 39:55.809
I could ever have.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.074
- Break your hand there, Hull?
- It's a nugget!

40:11.242 --> 40:13.660
It's the biggest damn nugget
I ever seen.

40:13.828 --> 40:17.330
Look here. Look at that.

40:17.665 --> 40:20.834
Isn't that beautiful?
That's almost as beautiful as Sarah?

40:21.001 --> 40:25.880
Sarah! Megan! Look!

40:27.174 --> 40:32.095
- Yeah, it figures.
- Sarah! Megan!

40:33.389 --> 40:35.098
Look!

40:35.891 --> 40:37.100
Hull's hit pay dirt.

40:40.688 --> 40:44.941
- It come from underneath that boulder.
- He found it under the boulder.

40:45.609 --> 40:48.361
I was right. You know, I was right.

40:49.196 --> 40:52.949
It must weigh all of 4 ounces.
That's a quarter pound of gold. See that?

40:53.117 --> 40:54.868
- Look at that.
- Is that real?

40:55.035 --> 40:57.704
Real? Just look at it.

40:58.205 --> 41:00.206
Come here.

41:02.626 --> 41:05.462
- So how about we celebrate?
- Can we go into town?

41:05.880 --> 41:07.881
I don't think that's a very good idea.

41:08.048 --> 41:10.633
That would go a long way
to clearing your credit.

41:10.801 --> 41:13.178
It would, at that.
It would clear it and then some.

41:13.345 --> 41:14.971
Can we, please?

41:15.556 --> 41:18.475
- Well, what do you think?
- Why not?

41:18.642 --> 41:21.644
We've got as much right in town
as the next person.

41:23.063 --> 41:24.230
Come on.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.238
You going to town again, Mr. Barret?

41:32.406 --> 41:34.741
That's right. You wanna come along?

41:36.494 --> 41:39.245
No, our daddy wouldn't let us go to town.

41:39.538 --> 41:42.540
Sure is a nice day for it, though?

41:44.251 --> 41:46.711
Have a good time.

42:17.034 --> 42:20.370
I'll be right back. I'll go and
square things with Mr. Blankenship.

42:21.705 --> 42:24.082
- Take care of the ladies.
- That won't be hard.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.709
We'll get a soda after I'm done.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.139
Look.

42:45.312 --> 42:48.481
- I'll go get Hull.
- That's all right.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.567
He'll be fine.

42:55.072 --> 42:59.492
Mrs. Wheeler, Megan.

42:59.952 --> 43:02.078
My papa wants to see you, preacher.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.163
He does, does he?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.792
All right.

43:09.420 --> 43:13.131
- Don't go. I know it's a trick.
- I'll be all right.

43:13.465 --> 43:15.216
Good day.

43:20.514 --> 43:23.683
- What if they hurt him?
- Shut up, Megan.

43:24.685 --> 43:27.687
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.689
It's all right.

43:39.408 --> 43:42.910
Preacher, my name is Coy LaHood.

43:43.078 --> 43:44.621
I know.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.376
Do you imbibe, Reverend?

43:50.753 --> 43:53.212
Only after 9 in the morning.

43:55.299 --> 43:57.550
When I heard a parson
had come to town...

43:57.718 --> 44:03.014
I had an image of a pale, scrawny,
Bible-thumping Easterner...

44:03.307 --> 44:07.393
- ...with a linen handkerchief and bad lungs.
- That's me.

44:09.730 --> 44:11.481
Hardly.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.816
Your health, sir.

44:15.152 --> 44:18.738
You know, it occurred to me
it must be difficult for a man of faith...

44:18.906 --> 44:22.116
to carry the message
on an empty stomach, so to speak.

44:22.284 --> 44:28.164
So I thought, why not invite this devout
and humble man to preach in town?

44:28.957 --> 44:32.418
Why not let the town be his parish?
In fact...

44:32.878 --> 44:34.921
why not build him a brand-new church?

44:38.092 --> 44:41.886
I can see where a preacher'd be
mighty tempted by an offer like that.

44:42.137 --> 44:43.596
Oh, indeed.

44:45.391 --> 44:49.352
First thing you know, he'd be thinking about
getting himself a batch of new clothes.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.229
Why, we'd have them tailor-made.

44:52.356 --> 44:55.274
Then he'd start thinking
about those Sunday collections.

44:55.734 --> 45:00.446
Well, hell, in a town as rich as LaHood,
that preacher, he'd be a wealthy man.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.407
That's why it wouldn't work.

45:03.867 --> 45:07.954
Can't serve God and mammon both.
Mammon being money.

45:20.759 --> 45:22.301
I opened this country.

45:22.720 --> 45:26.806
I made this town what it is.
I brought jobs and industry.

45:26.974 --> 45:30.435
I built an empire with my own two hands.

45:30.602 --> 45:33.771
And I've never asked help of anyone.

45:34.356 --> 45:39.235
Those squatters, Reverend,
are standing in the way of progress.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.070
Theirs or yours?

45:43.824 --> 45:48.161
Here, look, look. Just look at that writ!
Comes hot from Sacramento...

45:48.328 --> 45:51.664
and it tells me I've got mineral rights
to that whole damn canyon.

45:52.583 --> 45:57.044
Well, that hardly seems likely. If you had
those rights, you'd have exercised them.

45:57.212 --> 46:02.091
No, I think those people have legal claims.
You can't mine that canyon until they leave.

46:02.259 --> 46:04.135
Damn it! Come on, read that writ!

46:04.303 --> 46:08.181
If it was worth the paper it was printed
on, you wouldn't be trying to bribe me.

46:16.023 --> 46:19.192
What's your business
with those tin pans, Reverend?

46:19.610 --> 46:21.527
Nothing. They're just friends.

46:23.572 --> 46:28.201
Well, you and your friends
got 24 hours to pack up and leave...

46:28.368 --> 46:31.370
or my men will ride through
that canyon and run you out.

46:32.289 --> 46:35.124
I've been a law-abiding man,
but now I'm out of patience.

46:35.292 --> 46:38.211
And any blood gets spilt
will be on your hands.

46:54.269 --> 46:57.814
You're a troublemaker, stranger.

46:57.981 --> 47:02.693
You spell "bad cess" in letters
that stretch from here to Seattle.

47:07.533 --> 47:09.742
Thanks for the drink.

47:13.288 --> 47:14.997
Preacher...

47:15.165 --> 47:17.959
I mean, I've reasoned with you
and bargained with you...

47:18.126 --> 47:19.752
and I've come up short.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.923
What's mine is mine,
and if you make me fight for it, I will.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.593
There's a man, a marshal.

47:27.761 --> 47:32.598
He keeps the peace, if you take
my meaning. His name is Stockburn...

47:32.766 --> 47:35.643
and he won't be as patient as me.

47:38.105 --> 47:40.731
These people in Carbon Canyon...

47:40.941 --> 47:44.110
would you be willing to
pay cash for their claims?

47:44.278 --> 47:45.361
Buy them out?

47:46.822 --> 47:51.534
Well, hell, I'd do anything to prevent
bloodshed. How about $100 a head?

47:51.952 --> 47:53.202
How about 1000?

48:01.879 --> 48:04.714
I'll tell you what. I'll come up to 125.

48:06.425 --> 48:09.802
Stockburn and his deputies
will cost you a lot more than that.

48:12.806 --> 48:14.223
How would you know?

48:14.933 --> 48:17.476
How much is it worth
to have a clear conscience?

48:22.900 --> 48:25.318
A thousand dollars per claim, then.

48:25.485 --> 48:28.112
But I want them out of here in 24 hours!

48:32.326 --> 48:37.496
I paid off all accounts in full, Sarah.
I even had enough to pay off Spider's.

48:39.333 --> 48:40.750
Where is he?

48:41.418 --> 48:43.169
In there.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.466
Well, do something, Hull!

49:14.534 --> 49:16.077
What were you doing in there?

49:16.244 --> 49:18.704
LaHood was buying me a drink.

49:18.872 --> 49:20.873
Thanks for the thought.

49:21.416 --> 49:23.084
So we all vote in favor?

49:23.251 --> 49:24.460
- Yeah.
- Say "aye."

49:24.628 --> 49:26.712
- Speak up. All those in favor?
- Aye.

49:26.880 --> 49:28.214
Are any opposed?

49:28.382 --> 49:30.383
Me, dang it.

49:32.636 --> 49:37.264
Me and Coy LaHood seen a lot of ground
together, starting back in '55.

49:37.432 --> 49:40.059
He may be greedy, but he ain't no fool.

49:40.560 --> 49:44.605
If he's willing to cough up $1000 a claim,
it's because it's worth five times that.

49:44.773 --> 49:47.733
The way LaHood works, maybe it is.
The way we work...

49:47.901 --> 49:50.903
we're lucky to see $1000 a year.

49:51.697 --> 49:55.700
- I say we take his offer.
- Yeah.

49:56.827 --> 49:59.286
Suppose you struck 1000 bucks
in nuggets.

49:59.454 --> 50:02.873
Would you quit and blow town?
Or keep digging?

50:10.424 --> 50:12.258
What do you say, preacher?

50:13.385 --> 50:16.971
What I say doesn't matter.
It's your sweat he's buying.

50:17.639 --> 50:20.558
Why don't you sleep on it,
make the decision in the morning?

50:22.060 --> 50:25.855
What if we don't decide in the morning?
What happens if we can't decide?

50:26.523 --> 50:29.775
Well, then I suppose
LaHood'll take that as no.

50:30.235 --> 50:31.569
And then what?

50:31.987 --> 50:34.488
He said he'd call in a marshal.

50:34.781 --> 50:36.574
What kind of threat is that?

50:37.451 --> 50:40.578
- We have nothing to fear from the law.
- Law abiding.

50:40.746 --> 50:43.622
This is no ordinary kind of marshal.

50:43.790 --> 50:46.917
His name is Stockburn.
He travels with six deputies.

50:47.335 --> 50:50.296
And they uphold whatever law
pays them the most.

50:50.464 --> 50:54.091
Killing is a way of life with them.
I'm telling you this...

50:54.259 --> 50:57.845
because in case you decide against
LaHood's offer, you're gonna meet him.

50:58.889 --> 51:01.807
You know this Stockburn?

51:03.477 --> 51:04.894
I've heard of him.

51:07.147 --> 51:08.314
I don't know.

51:08.482 --> 51:11.734
Well, we all know what we're up against.

51:12.319 --> 51:16.572
LaHood ain't just saying, "Take my offer."
He's saying, "Take my offer or else..."

51:16.740 --> 51:19.909
We're family men, Hull.
We're no match for seven guns.

51:20.077 --> 51:23.913
Yeah, but how many of us are there?
Twenty?

51:24.081 --> 51:28.334
I heard the preacher.
I know these men are professionals.

51:28.502 --> 51:30.628
But it's still 20 against seven, ain't it?

51:32.672 --> 51:35.508
And we know how to pull
a damn trigger, don't we?

51:35.675 --> 51:37.426
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we do.

51:37.803 --> 51:42.848
Look, if it comes down to it, I'm willing
to fight before I'll quit my claim...

51:43.016 --> 51:45.267
but, damn it, LaHood's offer's fair.

51:45.519 --> 51:49.230
I still vote that we take his money
and we start afresh somewhere else.

51:49.397 --> 51:53.275
Oh, starting fresh always sounds good
when you're in trouble...

51:53.860 --> 51:57.113
but before we vote to pack up
and leave...

51:57.280 --> 51:59.990
I think we ought to ask ourselves
why we're here.

52:00.158 --> 52:04.495
Because if it's no more than money,
then we're no better than LaHood himself.

52:06.289 --> 52:07.790
Spider here asked a question.

52:08.208 --> 52:12.628
If any one of us turned up $1000 worth
of nuggets, would he quit? Hell, no!

52:12.921 --> 52:15.381
He'd build his family a better house...

52:15.549 --> 52:18.884
and buy his kids better clothes...

52:20.053 --> 52:21.554
maybe build a school...

52:22.806 --> 52:23.889
or a church.

52:24.683 --> 52:27.643
I mean, if we were farmers,
we'd be planting crops.

52:27.811 --> 52:30.729
If we raised cattle, we'd be tending them.
But we're miners...

52:30.897 --> 52:32.690
so we dig and pan...

52:32.858 --> 52:35.067
and break our backs for gold.

52:35.235 --> 52:40.239
But gold ain't what we're about.
It ain't what I'm about.

52:40.407 --> 52:44.869
I came out here to raise a family.
This is my home.

52:45.287 --> 52:48.581
This is my dream. I've sunk roots here.

52:49.666 --> 52:55.171
Now, we all have buried members
of our families in this ground.

52:55.630 --> 52:58.549
And this is their dream too,
and they died for it.

52:59.092 --> 53:03.220
Now we're gonna take $1000
and leave their graves untended?

53:04.514 --> 53:06.765
We owe them more than that, don't we?

53:07.934 --> 53:10.102
We owe ourselves more.

53:10.270 --> 53:12.938
Because if we sell out now...

53:14.691 --> 53:18.110
what price do we put
on our dignity next time?

53:19.946 --> 53:21.947
Two thousand dollars?

53:24.075 --> 53:25.743
Less?

53:28.830 --> 53:30.956
Or just the best offer?

53:37.380 --> 53:39.924
I say to hell with LaHood.

53:40.342 --> 53:43.052
- Yeah.
- I'm with you.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.554
- We stay.
- I...

53:45.722 --> 53:49.266
I ain't a brave man,
but I ain't no coward neither.

53:49.434 --> 53:53.229
We took our chances this far.
I vote we keep it up.

53:53.396 --> 53:55.648
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:55.815 --> 53:57.483
To hell with LaHood.

53:57.651 --> 53:58.776
Let them come.

53:59.361 --> 54:01.028
We're ready.

54:02.822 --> 54:05.366
- To hell with him.
- Yeah.

54:17.128 --> 54:18.504
We'll stand together.

54:20.173 --> 54:21.966
See you in the morning.

54:22.217 --> 54:24.301
I'm gonna turn in now.

54:27.806 --> 54:29.848
That's it for me.

54:48.952 --> 54:52.037
- Hello.
- Hello.

54:53.748 --> 54:56.417
I buried my dog over here.

55:02.507 --> 55:05.050
Well, that's hallowed ground, then.

55:06.136 --> 55:07.803
I said a prayer for her.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.139
It was after the raid.

55:11.516 --> 55:13.726
I prayed for a miracle.

55:13.893 --> 55:16.895
Well, maybe someday
you'll get that miracle.

55:19.065 --> 55:20.858
It was the day you arrived.

55:29.075 --> 55:30.826
I think I love you.

55:33.955 --> 55:36.165
There's nothing wrong with that.

55:37.417 --> 55:39.752
If there was more love in the world...

55:39.919 --> 55:42.963
there'd probably be a lot less dying.

55:47.177 --> 55:51.930
Then there can't be anything wrong
with making love either.

55:58.772 --> 56:01.398
I think it's best just to...

56:01.649 --> 56:05.235
practice loving for a while
before you think about the other.

56:08.073 --> 56:12.409
If I practice just loving for a while,
will you teach me the other?

56:16.456 --> 56:18.999
Megan, most folks around...

56:19.751 --> 56:22.711
kind of associate that with marriage.

56:23.963 --> 56:26.673
I'll be 15 next month.

56:27.133 --> 56:30.135
Mama was married when she was 15.

56:33.098 --> 56:34.556
Will you teach me then?

56:40.480 --> 56:44.983
Ninety-nine out of 100 men'd
be proud to say yes to that, Megan.

56:45.151 --> 56:49.780
But a young girl, a young woman like you...

56:51.825 --> 56:54.660
you wouldn't wanna spend your future
on a man like me.

56:56.204 --> 56:57.746
Why not?

56:58.456 --> 57:00.165
That's just the way it is.

57:01.418 --> 57:03.836
I don't understand.

57:04.379 --> 57:05.879
I don't believe you.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.674
I don't wanna believe you.

57:11.177 --> 57:14.179
Whatever you're saying, it isn't true.

57:14.347 --> 57:15.973
It isn't fair.

57:17.350 --> 57:19.226
Come on now.

57:20.437 --> 57:23.021
That's no way to pass a test.

57:26.276 --> 57:27.943
Test?

57:28.528 --> 57:30.237
Trust.

57:31.364 --> 57:32.781
If you love someone...

57:33.658 --> 57:34.992
you gotta try to...

57:35.160 --> 57:37.870
trust what they tell you is true.

57:39.414 --> 57:42.207
Even if it means they can't be together?

57:43.209 --> 57:46.503
Someday a young man's gonna
come along, the right man.

57:48.381 --> 57:51.049
Then none of this'll matter anymore.

57:55.472 --> 57:59.850
Now, if I was your mama,
I'd be worried about where you are.

58:01.352 --> 58:04.188
It's my mama you love, isn't it?

58:05.732 --> 58:08.942
Your mama's a fine woman,
and so are you.

58:10.904 --> 58:14.656
The way you look at her
and the way she looks at you...

58:14.824 --> 58:18.368
It's true. I don't care. You can have her.

58:18.870 --> 58:22.247
- I never wanna see you again.
- Megan.

58:23.082 --> 58:25.918
I hope you die and I hope you go to hell.

59:08.795 --> 59:10.963
Tell your father they turned him down.

01:00:04.475 --> 01:00:08.020
- McGill. You're just in time for the mail.
- Hell with the mail.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:11.356
The boss wants this telegram sent
right now.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.692
All right.

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.616
Preacher?

01:01:22.887 --> 01:01:24.721
He's gone.

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:28.266
What? Who?

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:32.020
The preacher. Packed up and left.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.522
But why?

01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:36.358
Where to?

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:39.277
I don't know.
He must have left before sunup.

01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:43.865
Well...

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:48.286
He must have gone to tell LaHood
about the vote last night.

01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:51.915
With his bedroll and coat?

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.711
Well, I can't believe that he's gone.

01:01:56.254 --> 01:02:00.465
I mean, it's not like him.
He would have said something to us.

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:03.593
Well, I reckon we'll survive.

01:02:05.304 --> 01:02:08.807
All this talk about fighting,
no wonder he's gone.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:10.767
What's that supposed to mean?

01:02:10.935 --> 01:02:14.980
LaHood and Marshal Stockburn be damned!
Isn't that what you decided last night?

01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:17.649
I spoke my mind, if that's what you mean.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.944
You got the rest of them
to vote your way, didn't you?

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:23.488
They voted their conscience.

01:02:23.656 --> 01:02:25.407
They voted to fight!

01:02:25.658 --> 01:02:28.493
Damn right! If that's what it comes to.

01:02:28.661 --> 01:02:32.664
You think they'd have voted that way
before the preacher came?

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:35.083
Or if they knew he wouldn't be here?

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:39.171
- They voted to stick together.
- The preacher was holding them together.

01:02:39.338 --> 01:02:41.339
They knew he helped you in town.

01:02:41.674 --> 01:02:46.511
They watched him stand up
to that animal LaHood sent out here!

01:02:46.679 --> 01:02:50.515
They were counting on him
to beat LaHood himself!

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:58.023
I reckon I did all right by you
before he came. Didn't I?

01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:35.101
Damned if that don't cut it.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.043
LaHood dammed up the creek.

01:04:00.878 --> 01:04:05.966
If you'd accepted LaHood's offer,
this never would have happened.

01:04:21.732 --> 01:04:23.191
Ten, 20...

01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:24.776
and 30.

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:28.113
Thank you, Miss Halper.
Come back and see us.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:32.033
Reverend. What can I do for you?

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.665
There you are.

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:04.691
Well, I reckon it's time to pack up
the missis and light out of here.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.569
Sure don't seem like we got much choice.

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:12.949
How about you, Barret? Any ideas?

01:05:16.537 --> 01:05:19.623
Where's the preacher?
He'll know what to do.

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:21.499
He ain't here.

01:05:25.129 --> 01:05:28.882
- You mean he's gone?
- He...

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.593
He went to tell LaHood
that we turned him down.

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.013
But before he left...

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:40.602
he said that if anything happened,
that he hoped we'd do like he'd do...

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:41.937
if he was here.

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:48.193
Shit.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.115
I don't know.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:58.036
I suppose we could dry-pan
for a couple days, come to think of it.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:01.957
I know he'd hate to see us quit,
without we gave it our best.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:07.003
Let's play it out a couple days.
What can we lose?

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:14.219
One nugget. I'd like to find me
one big nugget.

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:18.515
I'd shove it so far up LaHood's ass,
it'd wink at him when he washes his teeth.

01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:47.085
You got sand, Barret...

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.754
but you can't lie worth a damn.

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:54.259
With the preacher gone and LaHood on
the warpath, your life won't be worth spit.

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:57.595
If I was you,
I'd pack them two ladies and git.

01:07:48.647 --> 01:07:50.315
Hull?

01:07:52.276 --> 01:07:53.651
What?

01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:56.571
You angry at me?

01:07:57.114 --> 01:07:59.324
No. Whatever gave you that notion?

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:01.785
You angry at Mama, then?

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:06.247
Well, I wouldn't say that. Not angry.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:11.336
She hurt your feelings, didn't she?
I know how that feels.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.922
Yeah, well...

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.508
let's talk about it later?

01:08:18.676 --> 01:08:20.345
Hull, can I borrow the mare?

01:08:22.389 --> 01:08:23.848
Can you saddle her?

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:25.850
I already did.

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:28.478
Sure, take her out for a stretch.

01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:51.542
Rich, by Christ!

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:54.045
Sweet Holy Ghost, I've struck it rich!

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:01.426
Gossage, look at this!

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.054
Henderson!

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:06.808
Rich!

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:08.977
Look at this!

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.899
Eddie! Teddy.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:17.193
You pair of clodpolls.

01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:20.196
Come see what your daddy
pulled out of the stream.

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:25.618
LaHood!

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:29.831
You sugar-legged toad, I beat you!

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:33.376
Look at this! Old Spider's struck it rich.

01:09:33.544 --> 01:09:35.920
- What you got there, Daddy?
- What's it look like...

01:09:36.087 --> 01:09:40.341
you brainless barn owl? It's gold!

01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:46.890
Go get the mules.

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:49.600
We're going to town.

01:09:49.768 --> 01:09:54.063
- Us? We're going to town.
- We're going to town.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:31.476
Sarah, I wanna apologize
if anything I've said or done...

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:33.978
is gonna stand between us.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.565
Can't think of any such.

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:45.114
- Sure looks like Spider's payday come.
- Yeah.

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:49.744
Maybe it's just his turn,
like it was your turn a couple days ago.

01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:53.539
Well, at least someone will leave
Carbon Canyon a few dollars richer.

01:10:53.707 --> 01:10:55.708
Looks like.

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.503
When we all pack up...

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:03.174
there's room in my wagon for anything
you're wanting to take with you.

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:09.347
Are you asking us to leave here with you?

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:12.642
Well, I reckon we're all going, aren't we?

01:11:15.145 --> 01:11:17.480
Damn it, Sarah,
ever since your daddy died...

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.858
I've done the best I could
to help you and Megan...

01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:25.363
without putting any conditions on it.
I'm putting one on. You owe me the truth.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.241
Now, what do you have against me?

01:11:29.326 --> 01:11:33.663
- Nothing.
- Is there a chance for us being together?

01:11:37.918 --> 01:11:42.839
You are the decentest man
I ever met, Hull Barret.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.303
The answer is yes.

01:11:53.058 --> 01:11:56.394
- Sarah.
- Hull...

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:59.022
I apologize...

01:11:59.356 --> 01:12:03.192
for being so high-strung lately.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.570
It's just that I...

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.740
I've been so confused.

01:12:08.907 --> 01:12:12.827
With everything that's been going on,
it's a wonder we all ain't crazy.

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:16.831
But we've got nothing more to worry about.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:20.543
We'll start all over again someplace new.

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:22.712
The three of us.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:27.258
And the first town we get to,
we'll find ourselves another preacher.

01:12:28.093 --> 01:12:29.761
Yes.

01:12:34.266 --> 01:12:36.476
Another preacher.

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:57.789
Come to see how the rich folks do it?

01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:00.375
Maybe.

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.378
Your mama know where you are?

01:13:05.005 --> 01:13:07.048
I don't tell her everything.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.884
She wouldn't like it much
if she knew you were here.

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:14.931
I'm 15, same age as her when she
got married. I can do whatever I want.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:19.352
You want me to show you around?
That is why you came here, isn't it?

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:27.402
Three-quarters of a mile up the stream,
we diverted half of Cobalt Creek.

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:30.238
It flows through a ditch
along the contours of the slope.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:33.658
It ends up about 100 yards up yonder.

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:37.787
- It can't just end.
- Well, it doesn't really.

01:13:38.705 --> 01:13:42.125
It flows into a length of 3-foot pipe...

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:46.087
and then that flows downslope
real steep...

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.840
and then that narrows
to a 2-foot pipe...

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:52.718
and then a 1-foot pipe. All that time,
that water's going down slow...

01:13:52.886 --> 01:13:54.512
but picks up speed...

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.390
and it picks up force
by going into a thinner pipe.

01:13:57.558 --> 01:13:59.308
It hurts my ears.

01:14:01.353 --> 01:14:04.480
By the time the water
reaches the monitor...

01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:07.900
I got about 200 pounds of pressure
per square inch.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:11.988
I could blast that gravel
out of that cliff...

01:14:12.197 --> 01:14:16.284
then it washes down into the bed
and then it travels through the sluice.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.369
It looks like hell.

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:22.457
You know, I can get 20 tons
of gravel a day on this rig.

01:14:25.502 --> 01:14:28.171
So, tell me, what did you
really come up here for?

01:14:29.548 --> 01:14:32.717
I was just riding.
Figured I'd take a look around.

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:35.219
Yeah?

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:39.056
I'm wanting to take a look too. At you.

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:43.144
Real close.

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:58.576
Look what I got me, boys.
A tin pan's daughter.

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.903
No, please, stop! No!

01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:36.155
Get up on her, Josh.

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:42.286
Come on, Josh.

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:49.335
You got her, you got her. Come on.

01:15:50.754 --> 01:15:53.839
- No. No.
- Get up on her, Josh.

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:58.803
- Come on.
- Stop. Stop, please.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.180
Stop. Stop.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:44.575
LaHood!

01:17:48.872 --> 01:17:51.499
It's old Spider!

01:17:54.294 --> 01:17:56.962
Come on out and have a drink...

01:17:57.214 --> 01:18:00.800
with an honest man, you skunk's butt!

01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:04.553
Is he one of them?

01:18:04.721 --> 01:18:06.806
A piece of trash.

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:10.518
Named Conway. Used to work for me.

01:18:11.895 --> 01:18:13.104
It's too bad.

01:18:13.438 --> 01:18:15.398
For a while there, I had them buffaloed.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:19.276
Then this preacher come along
and shot them full of sass.

01:18:19.444 --> 01:18:20.736
Preacher?

01:18:21.571 --> 01:18:23.948
You take care of him...

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:26.283
along with the rest.

01:18:27.994 --> 01:18:30.371
Made me look bad in front of my men.

01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:33.290
He whipped four of them.

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:38.087
- A preacher did that?
- You're damn right he did.

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:41.173
What did this preacher look like?

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:46.387
- Well, he was tall and lean.
- You're gonna pay for it.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.847
His eyes...

01:18:48.014 --> 01:18:52.810
Yeah, his eyes,
something strange about them.

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:58.023
That mean something to you?

01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:02.862
You're gonna lose it all, Coy!

01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:05.823
Sounds like a man I once knew.

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:11.537
Might be. He recognized your name.

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:24.175
It couldn't be.

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:29.263
The man I'm thinking about is dead.

01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:32.516
I got you, Coy.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.730
I know you're in there, Coy!

01:19:39.357 --> 01:19:42.276
I got something to show you.

01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:47.239
Come on out and have a drink...

01:19:47.407 --> 01:19:50.910
you old sow belly in bloat!

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:56.457
Sounds like your daddy's running out
of steam. You better take him home now.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:20:00.002
No. Hell, Mr. Blankenship,
we only get to town here once a year.

01:21:06.736 --> 01:21:09.613
- Where's LaHood?
- Inside.

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:13.784
What is it you want?

01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:17.955
You're Stockburn.

01:21:19.457 --> 01:21:21.250
Yes.

01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:23.294
These are my deputies.

01:21:25.463 --> 01:21:29.258
Gentlemen, say hello to Mr. Conway.

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:42.938
I have no grief with you.
It's Coy I wanna talk to.

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:45.566
He's listening.

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.153
LaHood!

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:54.617
You creepy-legged lizard.

01:21:55.118 --> 01:21:58.329
I don't think Mr. LaHood
wants to talk to you...

01:21:58.496 --> 01:22:00.456
tin pan.

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:04.877
Maybe he'd like to watch you dance.

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:08.422
I don't know how to dance.

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:16.847
It's easy.

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:18.766
You just move your feet...

01:22:20.143 --> 01:22:21.769
to the rhythm.

01:22:28.568 --> 01:22:29.902
Daddy!

01:22:35.575 --> 01:22:38.035
Stay where you are, boys!

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.454
Some music, gentlemen.

01:23:39.889 --> 01:23:41.348
No!

01:23:45.228 --> 01:23:46.353
Pop?

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:53.777
Take him back to Carbon Canyon.

01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:57.406
You tell that preacher to meet me here...

01:23:57.615 --> 01:23:59.533
tomorrow morning.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:32.608
Stop. Who are you?

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:36.445
You know which end of that thing
the bullet comes out of?

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:41.700
Preacher. You won't believe what's
happened. LaHood dammed up the stream.

01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:43.994
Spider found a lump chock full of nuggets.

01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:48.290
The Wheeler girl's horse come back
without her. Everybody's out looking.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:50.918
I'll be damned.

01:25:03.848 --> 01:25:06.016
She got caught up at LaHood's,
but she's fine.

01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:10.270
You're home now, Megan.

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.856
Your mama's here.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.037
Preacher?

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:46.390
You better come outside.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.910
Then him and his men...

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:09.204
they shot him.

01:26:09.914 --> 01:26:11.582
Forever.

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:17.254
The bullets kept hitting him forever.

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:23.677
It was him, wasn't it?

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:26.763
It was that marshal you warned us about.

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:29.266
Stockburn.

01:26:29.934 --> 01:26:31.602
Stockburn and his deputies.

01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:35.480
He said, "Tell the preacher
to come in the morning."

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.274
Why you?

01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:43.697
The night you warned us about this
Stockburn, it sounded like you knew him.

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:46.533
Spider asked you that himself.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:47.951
Is it true?

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:58.795
The vote you took the other night
showed courage.

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:03.175
You voted to stick together.
That's just what you should do.

01:27:03.635 --> 01:27:07.054
Spider made a mistake.
He went into town alone.

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:10.557
A man alone is easy prey.

01:27:11.184 --> 01:27:15.312
Only by standing together are you going to
be able to beat the LaHoods of the world.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.650
No matter what happens tomorrow,
don't you forget that.

01:27:21.277 --> 01:27:25.322
You've got a brave man there.
Give him a decent burial.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:26.990
Preacher?

01:27:30.453 --> 01:27:33.455
You are going into town tomorrow,
ain't you?

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.337
How can you say that?

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.474
Megan feeling any better?

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:56.395
She's sleeping.

01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:00.399
Thank you for what you did.

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:04.945
Well, there's no need.
I'm just glad I happened by.

01:28:06.072 --> 01:28:08.615
That first day, when Hull told me...

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:11.034
what happened in town...

01:28:11.202 --> 01:28:13.704
I knew you were a gunfighter.

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:18.125
Lots of people carry guns.

01:28:19.585 --> 01:28:23.046
Megan told me what you did
with Josh LaHood.

01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:27.301
Who but a gunfighter
could have done such a thing?

01:28:30.596 --> 01:28:32.347
Would you care for some coffee?

01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:33.890
The folk here tell me...

01:28:34.058 --> 01:28:38.061
that you're planning to go to town
and face that marshal and his deputies.

01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:41.815
- That's right.
- Don't.

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:43.233
Please.

01:28:43.901 --> 01:28:47.112
It's an old score and
it's time to settle it.

01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:54.077
I wish there was something I could
do or say to change your mind.

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:01.501
When you left the other day...

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:06.089
it reminded me of a time
when someone left me.

01:29:07.216 --> 01:29:10.927
After that, I swore
I would never be hurt again.

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:15.098
Or love again.

01:29:16.267 --> 01:29:19.519
Then you rode into our lives.

01:29:20.772 --> 01:29:23.231
I couldn't help what I felt.

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:27.277
Oh, God, I wish I could
control my feelings.

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.699
After you left,
I thought you'd gone for good.

01:29:33.242 --> 01:29:36.411
It forced me to grow up...

01:29:36.746 --> 01:29:39.122
see things differently.

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:43.085
Appreciate what I have.

01:29:45.296 --> 01:29:48.507
I need a man who would never leave me.

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.759
Can you understand that?

01:29:53.346 --> 01:29:56.973
And you would leave again one day,
wouldn't you?

01:29:58.434 --> 01:29:59.726
Yes.

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:07.109
Then it's best this way.

01:30:08.152 --> 01:30:10.362
I'm gonna marry Hull.

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:15.117
- Hull is a good man.
- Yes, he is.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:22.874
This is just so I won't wake up at night...

01:30:23.042 --> 01:30:25.419
for the rest of my life...

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:28.046
wondering.

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:46.982
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Sarah.

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:52.445
Preacher!

01:30:57.118 --> 01:30:58.285
Who was that?

01:31:00.037 --> 01:31:01.705
A voice from the past.

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:03.873
Preacher!

01:31:11.674 --> 01:31:13.425
Sarah.

01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:16.052
Close the door.

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:33.528
Who are you?

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.241
Who are you...

01:31:38.409 --> 01:31:40.076
really?

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:45.749
Well, it really doesn't matter, does it?

01:31:47.376 --> 01:31:48.877
No.

01:31:55.092 --> 01:31:57.092
Preacher!

01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:16.363
Good morning, Barret.

01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:19.866
- Little early, isn't it?
- A little.

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:26.039
Good gun for buffalo. The problem is,
there aren't any hereabouts.

01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:30.210
I'm going with you.

01:32:30.461 --> 01:32:33.380
There's no buffalo where I'm going either.

01:32:39.178 --> 01:32:40.220
I know.

01:32:42.431 --> 01:32:45.809
Even with that rifle,
you wouldn't stand much of a chance.

01:32:46.686 --> 01:32:49.312
That's for me to decide, isn't it?

01:32:50.982 --> 01:32:52.816
Suit yourself.

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:26.016
Oh, Jesus!

01:33:26.183 --> 01:33:29.477
Run, damn it! Run!

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.683
Yeah.

01:34:17.568 --> 01:34:18.735
Get out!

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:20.820
Move it! Move it!

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:23.740
Out of my way! Let me out! Get out!

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:25.575
Get out of the way!

01:34:25.743 --> 01:34:28.953
- Run for it!
- Move it, move it, move it.

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:32.559
What the hell are you doing?

01:35:33.853 --> 01:35:38.648
You're a good man, Barret.
You take care of Sarah and the girl.

01:35:41.318 --> 01:35:43.695
So long, preacher.

01:35:59.044 --> 01:36:02.255
I thought you were still sleeping,
and you're dressed.

01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:05.550
The preacher's gone, isn't he?

01:36:07.011 --> 01:36:08.178
Yes.

01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:12.015
Did you tell him you loved him?

01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:16.144
He knows we both love him.

01:36:19.356 --> 01:36:21.316
Did you say goodbye to him?

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:24.861
Yes.

01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:30.742
I didn't.

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:41.377
Megan!

01:36:57.061 --> 01:36:58.186
Yeah, that's him.

01:36:58.896 --> 01:37:01.314
That's the preacher, all right.

01:37:06.028 --> 01:37:08.238
You ever seen him before?

01:37:10.074 --> 01:37:11.825
Can't see his face from here.

01:37:21.627 --> 01:37:23.336
I'll be damned.

01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:50.280
What's he up to?

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:11.676
Well, son, coffee?

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:16.306
- Ma'am.
- There we are. Piping hot.

01:38:16.473 --> 01:38:19.976
I think you and Mr. Blankenship
ought to take a stroll.

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:13.821
The son of a bitch
is sitting there drinking coffee.

01:39:13.989 --> 01:39:16.366
He's even got his back to the door.

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.368
Well...

01:39:18.702 --> 01:39:22.705
I reckon all of us don't need
that marshal, do we?

01:39:44.228 --> 01:39:47.480
It appears you won't have to bother
with the preacher.

01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:58.324
Are you through?

01:40:34.778 --> 01:40:37.071
Jesus.

01:41:22.576 --> 01:41:25.536
What the hell is he up to now?

01:41:26.288 --> 01:41:28.915
He's inviting us to join him.

01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:20.883
Fan out.

01:42:21.051 --> 01:42:22.426
Find him.

01:48:24.206 --> 01:48:25.498
You.

01:48:32.130 --> 01:48:33.255
You!

01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:02.011
Long walk.

01:50:02.929 --> 01:50:04.096
Yep.

01:50:47.766 --> 01:50:50.517
- Where is he?
- He's gone, Megan.

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:57.900
Child, he's gone.

01:50:58.068 --> 01:51:01.278
Megan, you can't drive these horses
anymore. You'll kill them.

01:51:15.126 --> 01:51:20.089
Preacher!

01:51:22.425 --> 01:51:24.093
We all love you, preacher!

01:51:29.641 --> 01:51:31.767
I love you!

01:51:39.818 --> 01:51:41.902
Thank you.

01:51:44.155 --> 01:51:46.073
Goodbye.

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:18.355
Come on. Come on.
