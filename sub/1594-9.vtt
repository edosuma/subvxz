WEBVTT

00:10.567 --> 00:14.367
Oh, man, you guys missed
a great party last week.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.500
(coughs)
Say hello to your

00:17.500 --> 00:19.233
new foster family, Ethel.

00:19.233 --> 00:20.467
You're one
of five wives?

00:20.467 --> 00:22.667
Married to a dude named Clyde?
Who's 65 years old?

00:22.667 --> 00:25.100
Would it be all right if
my son Jonah came to visit?

00:25.100 --> 00:26.100
Keep laughing,

00:26.100 --> 00:28.033
and I will slit your throat
while you sleep.

00:28.033 --> 00:29.166
LINDA:
Shoplifting is out of hand.

00:29.166 --> 00:30.533
Did Mickey pay for that?

00:30.533 --> 00:31.767
You have to stand
up to him.

00:31.767 --> 00:34.033
KASH: Tried that once
with his father.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.633
Now hold it like you want
to do something with it.

00:35.633 --> 00:37.667
Mickey? Again?
What was I supposed
to do,

00:37.667 --> 00:38.767
shoot him over
a cup of soup?

00:38.767 --> 00:40.300
No touching the forbidden fruit

00:40.300 --> 00:41.667
until I'm knocked up.

00:41.667 --> 00:42.633
IAN:
Slept with someone.

00:42.633 --> 00:43.600
Not cash.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.633
Guess this was like

00:44.633 --> 00:45.533
a booty call, huh?

00:45.533 --> 00:46.667
Yes.

00:46.667 --> 00:48.367
DEBBIE:
Steve got a text from Candace.

00:48.367 --> 00:49.233
Is he dating someone else?

00:49.233 --> 00:51.000
(yells)
Who the fuck is Candace?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.233
We work together.
That's all.

00:53.233 --> 00:56.000
I'm home.
Little brother!

00:56.000 --> 00:56.734
Hey, you.

00:56.734 --> 00:58.600
Mmm.

DEBBIE: Okay, but you
got to promise.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.333
Okay, I promise--
I won't tell Fiona.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.133
Now, whose house is this?

02:25.133 --> 02:26.467
I'm not sure.

02:26.467 --> 02:29.467
VERONICA:
What the hell are we doing here?

02:29.467 --> 02:31.734
Trying to find out
if Steve's cheating.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.133
What?

02:33.133 --> 02:36.133
Tell me that's not a woman's
car parked out front.

02:38.467 --> 02:39.734
Fiona's a big girl.

02:39.734 --> 02:44.400
Fiona takes care of everyone,
but no one takes care of Fiona.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.700
Is this about Candace?

02:45.700 --> 02:48.367
Because Fiona knows
about Candace.

02:48.367 --> 02:50.200
She wouldn't do anything;
too proud.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.633
So we have to.

02:51.633 --> 02:54.166
You're a sweet kid, Debs.

02:56.367 --> 02:58.266
(dance music throbbing)

03:17.333 --> 03:19.333
Did you purposefully
order a "Sex on the Beach"

03:19.333 --> 03:21.467
just so I'd say it
to the gay bartender?

03:21.467 --> 03:23.633
Maybe. Maybe I was
hoping you'd actually

03:23.633 --> 03:26.600
take me away someplace so
we could have sex on a beach.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.133
I could barely get you
overnight in a local hotel.

03:29.133 --> 03:31.000
Well, that was then;
this is now.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.066
I just feel like I haven't
seen a lot of you lately.

03:34.066 --> 03:37.300
You-you mean that you'd
like to see more of me?

03:38.433 --> 03:41.333
Yes, I guess
that's what I'm saying.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.500
Usually by this time
in a relationship,

03:47.500 --> 03:50.133
the guy starts just showing up
for late-night booty calls

03:50.133 --> 03:51.467
or wants me to
meet his mother.

03:51.467 --> 03:53.500
Either way, I start looking
for reasons to walk.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.433
Well, my mom is in Michigan,
so you don't have to worry.

03:56.433 --> 04:00.533
I think that's the
first time you've ever
mentioned your family.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.500
Really?

04:02.500 --> 04:04.000
Not much to say.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.400
I mean... they
live in Michigan.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.400
The whole state?
No, near Detroit.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.033
Dad used to work for GM,

04:11.033 --> 04:13.533
so I try to send back
what I can to help.

04:13.533 --> 04:17.300
Family business--
he builds 'em, you steal 'em.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.300
Come on, let's dance.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.300
Come on.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.300
(door opens)

04:28.300 --> 04:31.233
Liam is officially asleep.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.266
That was fast.
Yeah, well,

04:33.266 --> 04:35.166
three pages
from Deb's Eat, Pray, Love

04:35.166 --> 04:36.467
and he's out.
(laughs)

04:36.467 --> 04:38.433
And if James Franco
wasn't in the movie,

04:38.433 --> 04:39.600
I would've
nodded off, too.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.000
(chuckles)

04:42.000 --> 04:44.166
Have you got any cash
you can float me?

04:44.166 --> 04:46.567
Florence & the Machine
are playing down at
the Chicago Theater.

04:46.567 --> 04:48.734
I really want to take
Karen for her birthday.

04:48.734 --> 04:50.133
Pricey gift.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.000
You think it's
getting serious?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.767
Fuck off.
She's my best friend.
(laughs)

04:54.767 --> 04:58.333
Okay? You know I'd never
spend that kind of cash
on a girl, anyway.

04:58.333 --> 04:59.433
All right, well,

04:59.433 --> 05:01.600
I got a Hamilton,
and it's yours.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.433
Thanks, man.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.600
(Liam crying)

05:05.600 --> 05:07.533
BOTH:
One, two, three.

05:07.533 --> 05:09.333
(clicks tongue)

05:09.333 --> 05:12.033
ETHEL:
God bless Jonah,
my sweet baby boy.

05:12.033 --> 05:14.100
And God bless my husband Clyde.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.467
May those who are caring for him

05:15.467 --> 05:17.467
remind him to take
his blood pressure supplement

05:17.467 --> 05:20.266
and his Glucosamine/Chondroitin
supplement...

05:20.266 --> 05:23.433
so that he can bend down
to pick up our child.

05:23.433 --> 05:24.667
And God bless
the other wives,

05:24.667 --> 05:26.333
who are probably on
their knees right now

05:26.333 --> 05:28.734
asking you to bless me...
Separated from her kid?

05:28.734 --> 05:30.333
That's got to suck.

05:30.333 --> 05:33.433
Hopefully, the visit
with him tomorrow
will cheer her up.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.300
I'm kind of excited about it.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.700
Having a full house-- two kids.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.200
Don't get too excited.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.233
It's only temporary.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.367
Temporary, Kevin.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:43.367 --> 05:45.333
Mm-hmm.
Are you gonna put
those in my ass?

05:45.333 --> 05:47.533
'Cause I'm not even
gonna feel it.
They're earplugs, babe.

05:47.533 --> 05:49.233
And they're for her.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.367
Oh, good, 'cause
that would've sucked,

05:52.367 --> 05:54.367
trying to fish those out.
(laughs)

06:04.700 --> 06:06.633
(both groan)

06:10.100 --> 06:13.400
Hey... hey...

06:13.400 --> 06:15.367
Wakey, wakey,
Jackie Chan.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.533
(groans)

06:22.266 --> 06:25.100
Who the fuck are you?

06:25.100 --> 06:26.467
I'm Frank.

06:27.667 --> 06:30.433
(groans)

06:30.433 --> 06:32.266
Did we...?

06:32.266 --> 06:33.400
(chuckles)

06:35.200 --> 06:38.300
Aw, now... now...
(crying)

06:40.467 --> 06:42.033
Chins up.

06:44.266 --> 06:46.300
(gasps, groans)

06:56.400 --> 06:58.033
KAREN:
Fuck off.

06:58.033 --> 06:59.767
How'd you know it was me?

06:59.767 --> 07:02.033
I was talking

07:02.033 --> 07:04.233
to my Promisemakers
group, and...

07:04.233 --> 07:06.467
I want you to know
that I understand

07:06.467 --> 07:10.367
that so much of your bad
behavior is my responsibility.

07:10.367 --> 07:12.700
If you leave a dog
in the house alone

07:12.700 --> 07:16.166
for more than eight hours,
you can't get mad at him

07:16.166 --> 07:18.533
for peeing
the rug, right?

07:18.533 --> 07:22.767
I found this...
in an album in the basement.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.600
I don't know...

07:27.600 --> 07:29.667
maybe we can try to...

07:29.667 --> 07:31.467
capture more moments

07:31.467 --> 07:33.500
like these together.

07:37.433 --> 07:40.367
(blow dryer whirring)

07:44.767 --> 07:49.300
Why is it that I feel
like you can't get away
from me fast enough?

07:49.300 --> 07:50.433
(gasps, laughs)

07:50.433 --> 07:52.333
Because you're paranoid!

07:53.400 --> 07:55.700
Hey, whatever happened
to that computer class

07:55.700 --> 07:58.066
you were gonna take?
They cancelled it.

07:58.066 --> 07:59.133
Not enough people, I guess.

07:59.133 --> 08:00.533
Liam's gonna be up in a second.

08:00.533 --> 08:03.033
I got to get him fed and dressed
and to the clinic

08:03.033 --> 08:04.200
for some shots.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.300
Don't tell Jenny McCarthy.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.333
Hey, Debs.

08:08.333 --> 08:09.734
Steve.

08:09.734 --> 08:12.734
Liam up yet?

08:12.734 --> 08:14.200
Squawkin' a little.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.433
So, everything cool with, uh,
with you and Steve?

08:17.433 --> 08:19.200
What? Why?

08:19.200 --> 08:21.233
No reason-- I'm
just checking in.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.400
(sighs)

08:33.100 --> 08:34.767
Hi, baby bottoms!

08:34.767 --> 08:36.767
Did you have sweet dreams?

08:36.767 --> 08:39.265
I thought I was baby bottoms.
No.

08:39.265 --> 08:41.299
I said you have
a baby bottom.

08:41.299 --> 08:44.433
Mm, I swore I would never
date a guy whose ass was

08:44.433 --> 08:46.367
smaller than mine, but
I seem to be breaking

08:46.367 --> 08:47.700
a lot of my own rules lately,

08:47.700 --> 08:49.133
don't I?

08:49.133 --> 08:51.567
Don't I?
He's assuming
that was rhetorical.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.066
Hey, you want to come by
tonight after Liam's down?

08:56.066 --> 08:57.233
V gave me a copy

08:57.233 --> 08:58.367
of Queen of Outer Space.

08:58.367 --> 09:00.200
Zsa Zsa Gabor at her finest.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.133
We could watch it...
and not watch it.
I don't think

09:03.133 --> 09:05.700
I can swing it.
I gotta go to work.
Okay.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.567
Mm... ah.

09:08.734 --> 09:10.600
Hey, Steve!

09:14.033 --> 09:16.266
Debs, breakfast?
I'm good.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.100
Breakfast!
Hey, Steve, can I get
a ride to the library?

09:22.100 --> 09:23.266
Motorcycle;
no can do.

09:23.266 --> 09:26.400
When did you get
a motorcycle?
Always had one.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.533
I guess there's a lot
I don't know about you.
Truth?

09:29.533 --> 09:32.533
I'm in the CIA, and
this is all just a cover.

09:39.133 --> 09:40.633
Any calls, Kate?

09:40.633 --> 09:43.166
Yeah, actually, some
A-hole was looking for you.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.200
Left this number.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.166
Hand me the
phone, will ya?

09:47.166 --> 09:50.667
Your tab is bigger than
my ass, and you smell
like kimchi and vomit.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.233
Now, stop that.

09:52.233 --> 09:54.367
Your ass looks great.

09:54.367 --> 09:56.600
Like you in the sack,
make it quick.

09:56.600 --> 10:00.033
I wasn't quick, I was
just busy that day.
(scoffs)

10:03.433 --> 10:04.700
WOMAN:
Hello.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.767
(womanly): Yes. I have
Frank Gallagher calling.

10:07.767 --> 10:10.300
WOMAN:
Hey, Frankie.
Got great news.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.333
Who-who... who the fuck is this?

10:12.333 --> 10:14.333
Your settlement is in.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.033
Yeah! Which one?

10:16.033 --> 10:18.066
Come see me,
I'll give you the 411.

10:18.066 --> 10:20.233
(laughing)

10:20.233 --> 10:22.700
Hey, everybody!
Next round's on me!

10:22.700 --> 10:24.433
(laughs)

10:28.000 --> 10:31.133
DEBBIE:
Kev? Veronica?

10:31.133 --> 10:33.266
Didn't you just
clean that yesterday?

10:33.266 --> 10:36.633
Child Protective Services is
bring my baby Jonah for a visit.

10:36.633 --> 10:39.734
Everything has
to be just so.

10:39.734 --> 10:42.300
You're so lucky
you have a baby.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.734
How old are you?
Ten and a quarter.

10:44.734 --> 10:48.500
Two more years, and you'll
be old enough to start trying.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.734
Does it hurt?

10:51.734 --> 10:54.233
Sexual relations
or childbirth?

10:54.233 --> 10:55.467
Both.

10:55.467 --> 10:57.300
Yes.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.433
LIP (gasping):
Oh, fuck!

10:58.433 --> 11:00.066
KAREN:
He's such a douche bag.

11:00.066 --> 11:03.200
He's on this whole father-
daughter Purity Ball kick.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.567
(both moaning, gasping)

11:04.567 --> 11:08.066
KAREN:
He wants me to take
a vow of celibacy

11:08.066 --> 11:10.533
so we can rekindle our
father-daughter relationship.

11:10.533 --> 11:12.667
LIP:
Maybe we could not... talk
about your father right now.

11:12.667 --> 11:15.100
KAREN:
Not what you had in mind
for dirty talk.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.767
LIP:
Oh! Not exactly.

11:16.767 --> 11:18.367
(moaning)

11:18.367 --> 11:20.533
KAREN (laughs):
Oh, fuck!

11:21.734 --> 11:23.367
Oh, shit!

11:23.367 --> 11:26.133
LIP: Oh, shh,
Carl's right outside. Shh.
KAREN: Oh, fuck!

11:26.133 --> 11:27.500
Oh, fuck!

11:27.500 --> 11:28.633
KAREN:
Oh, shit!

11:28.633 --> 11:30.633
(Lip and Karen moaning,
gasping loudly)

11:30.633 --> 11:33.233
LIP: Oh, shit!
KAREN: Keep going! Oh...!

11:33.233 --> 11:35.033
(both yell)

11:38.633 --> 11:41.500
Yes? Shatterproof, my ass!

11:41.500 --> 11:44.233
(both sigh with satisfaction)

11:44.233 --> 11:45.367
(kiss)

11:45.367 --> 11:47.500
(Karen moans, Lip exhales)

11:47.500 --> 11:49.367
(Lip sighing)

11:49.367 --> 11:54.367
Want to go to the planetarium
tonight and get high?

11:54.367 --> 11:56.033
(panting)

11:56.033 --> 11:58.166
I can't. I'm busy.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.667
Doing what? Danielle?

11:59.667 --> 12:01.667
The less you know,
the better.

12:01.667 --> 12:05.500
Are we still on
for Friday night?

12:05.500 --> 12:07.367
Yeah.

12:07.367 --> 12:10.033
Can you give me a hint?

12:10.033 --> 12:12.667
Yeah, but...
I'm not gonna.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.533
(Lip sighs)

12:18.767 --> 12:20.367
Aha.

12:20.367 --> 12:22.567
Crucial Confrontations.

12:23.667 --> 12:26.033
Haven't seen you
here in a while.

12:26.033 --> 12:27.667
Been kind of
busy, Simon.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.100
I got a signed first
edition of Harry Potter.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.300
Overrated. Made a better
movie than a book.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.300
And now with all those
kid actors grown up,

12:35.300 --> 12:37.734
they're scarier looking
than the villains.

12:38.734 --> 12:41.100
Hey, can you help me
on the computers?

12:41.100 --> 12:42.433
What do you want to do?

12:42.433 --> 12:44.133
Dig up some dirt.

12:44.133 --> 12:45.667
Name.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.600
Steve... W-W-Wilson?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.433
Wilton?
You kind of
need to know

12:49.433 --> 12:51.600
what the name is before
you can look it up.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.633
Try Wilton,
in Lake Forest.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.066
There are zero
in Illinois,

13:00.066 --> 13:01.767
but there are 15
of them nationwide.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.033
Can you do it backwards?

13:03.033 --> 13:04.433
Notliw?
No. I mean,

13:04.433 --> 13:07.166
if I give you an address,
can you work from there?

13:07.166 --> 13:13.066
Hey, um, maybe sometime we
could just casually hang out.

13:13.066 --> 13:15.467
Fine. Fine, yes, we can
casually hang out.

13:15.467 --> 13:18.500
1055 North Ave.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.767
It says the
property owners

13:19.767 --> 13:23.066
are Lloyd and
Candace Lishman.

13:23.066 --> 13:25.333
Hello, Ms. D-lish.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.133
Cool, then we can, uh,
hang out sometime?

13:27.133 --> 13:28.600
We just did.

13:35.734 --> 13:37.734
(coins rattling)

13:38.734 --> 13:41.066
She opened an ING
Direct Savings account.

13:41.066 --> 13:43.533
I haven't kept any large bills
in there for months.

13:43.533 --> 13:46.033
Believe me, I've looked.
Do you know
where she is?

13:46.033 --> 13:48.567
No idea.
How much you need?
I've got to buy

13:48.567 --> 13:51.367
concert tickets.
Yikes. Wish
I had it.

13:51.367 --> 13:53.767
Maybe you should take Mrs.
Niedereiter up on her offer.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.033
Well, that should do it,
Mrs. Niedereiter.

14:02.133 --> 14:05.000
There are a lot of dark
corners around my house

14:05.000 --> 14:07.633
that could use some
attention, Phillip.

14:10.467 --> 14:13.200
Thanks for the idea.
You're not seriously

14:13.200 --> 14:14.567
gonna do it?

14:14.567 --> 14:18.300
Well, no, but... I could
smash her birdhouse again.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.433
Hey...

14:21.433 --> 14:23.467
what do you think of Steve?

14:23.467 --> 14:26.433
Ass is kind of small;
not really my type.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.734
You about to retreat
and count your wounded?

14:30.734 --> 14:32.033
No.

14:32.033 --> 14:35.667
Just... just want to know
if I should trust him.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.700
That's like asking if
you should believe in God.

14:41.367 --> 14:43.600
(knocking on door)
Just be yourself.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.567
Okay.

14:44.567 --> 14:47.567
(knocking continues)
Okay. Here we go.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.033
Hi. Come in.

14:53.033 --> 14:57.266
ETHEL: Jonah, baby!
Mama missed you so much!

14:59.433 --> 15:02.166
(quietly, gently):
Hi, baby. Hi.

15:02.166 --> 15:04.200
Good afternoon.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.700
I'm Kev.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.200
Mm-hmm.
This is my wife,
Veronica.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.633
Hello. Good afternoon.

15:09.633 --> 15:11.467
How you doing?

15:11.467 --> 15:14.000
I'm Andrea Johnson
from DCFS,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.600
and I'm here to observe
the home visit today.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.667
So if everything go good,

15:18.667 --> 15:21.100
then Baby Jonah
may stay overnight.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.400
Is your voice dressed
up for Halloween?

15:23.400 --> 15:25.066
Excuse me?

15:25.066 --> 15:27.333
Think we don't know how to...
raise a child?

15:27.333 --> 15:28.567
Come to tell me I don't know

15:28.567 --> 15:30.367
how to be a mother.

15:30.367 --> 15:32.700
Uh, you got it wrong,
sister girl.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.133
I'm here to see how
Ethel mothers, not you.

15:35.133 --> 15:37.667
What do you mean?
Oh, please, have a seat.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.767
That girl's only
13 years old,

15:39.767 --> 15:42.233
but she's still got
her parental rights.

15:42.233 --> 15:45.367
I need to make sure
the child can handle
a child, you feel me?

15:45.367 --> 15:47.133
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I feel  you.

15:47.133 --> 15:49.667
Mm.
(sighs)

15:49.667 --> 15:51.033
Oh! Baby Jonah!

15:52.300 --> 15:53.600
Look at you!

15:53.600 --> 15:55.767
You're hung like
a little bear, aren't you?

15:57.200 --> 15:58.700
Hey, Andrea?

15:58.700 --> 16:00.066
An-dray-ah.
An-dray-ah.

16:00.066 --> 16:02.367
You think we could
apply to get Baby Jonah

16:02.367 --> 16:04.367
as a foster kid, too?

16:04.367 --> 16:06.633
That's gonna be a crap-load
of paperwork for me,

16:06.633 --> 16:10.367
but we do encourage keeping
family members together.

16:10.367 --> 16:12.133
(quietly):
Yay!

16:14.533 --> 16:17.000
(footsteps approaching)

16:18.600 --> 16:23.100
All right, then, uh, Eddie's
just down in the basement.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.133
He'll be right up.

16:24.133 --> 16:25.066
And, of course,

16:25.066 --> 16:26.734
you will all get your shoes back

16:26.734 --> 16:28.133
when you go,
so don't worry.

16:28.133 --> 16:31.266
It'd be great if mine
came back shined.

16:31.266 --> 16:33.533
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...!
(laughter)

16:33.533 --> 16:35.600
That would be great!

16:35.600 --> 16:38.200
(knocking on door)

16:38.200 --> 16:40.500
Ah, but at last
came a knock,

16:40.500 --> 16:42.066
and I thought
of the door

16:42.066 --> 16:45.033
with no lock to lock.

16:45.033 --> 16:49.033
Robert Frost-- I was
a poetry major in college.

16:51.233 --> 16:53.100
SHEILA: Oh, sweetie.
Okay, open your Bibles
to Psalms 127,

16:53.100 --> 16:56.767
SHEILA:
Okay, uh...
verses three to five.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.400
Okay.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.500
You guys are
all... okay.

17:01.633 --> 17:03.300
(laughs)
Oh, sweetie...

17:03.300 --> 17:04.767
(chuckles)

17:04.767 --> 17:06.200
Oh!

17:06.200 --> 17:08.066
Oh, you are ripe!

17:08.066 --> 17:10.633
Oh, nothing a little
Puerto Rican bath can't fix.

17:10.633 --> 17:12.733
(laughing):
Oh... honey.

17:12.733 --> 17:14.233
Where were you last night?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.633
I had to spend the
night with the kids.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.266
They needed a little
Frankie time.

17:18.266 --> 17:20.767
Oh. You're such
a good dad.

17:20.767 --> 17:22.165
(laughs)

17:22.165 --> 17:24.200
Oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
EDDIE:
Sorry, folks.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.567
Had a little plumbing issue.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.400
The house's, not mine.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.133
(group laughing, guffawing)

Lou?

18:07.700 --> 18:10.100
Frankie boy,
how's it hanging?

18:10.100 --> 18:12.400
Still from the left.
Where the hell are you?

18:12.400 --> 18:15.433
Jesus, it's hard to take a piss
with this thing on.

18:15.433 --> 18:17.767
That's a lie. It was the wiping
that was tough.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.200
This from the escalator
thing at the mall?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.734
No, no, no, this is
the train doors

18:22.734 --> 18:24.567
closing on your ankle.
Right.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.300
I haven't been the same since.

18:26.300 --> 18:29.700
Yeah. All I need is
your signature and Monica's,

18:29.700 --> 18:31.567
and the money is
all yours...

18:31.567 --> 18:32.500
with the exception

18:32.500 --> 18:34.767
of a third of it,
that goes to me.

18:34.767 --> 18:36.200
Plus expenses.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.300
Sounds fair.

18:39.300 --> 18:42.433
Me... and Monica.

18:42.433 --> 18:44.166
Yay.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.600
That was a hell of warm-up.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.333
Unfortunately, those aren't
the originals

18:47.333 --> 18:50.200
You two will have to go down
to the city legal offices

18:50.200 --> 18:51.600
and do it in person.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.533
What? I'm supposed
to take off work
to go do this?

18:54.533 --> 18:57.200
Of course not,
because as you know,

18:57.200 --> 18:58.734
those injury's prevented you
from working, remember?

18:58.734 --> 19:01.567
Oh, shit.

19:01.567 --> 19:02.734
(pager beeps)

19:02.734 --> 19:04.367
Hey, look at that.

19:04.367 --> 19:07.333
Client just went
into labor.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.567
Is that gonna be a problem,
getting Monica to sign?

19:09.567 --> 19:12.467
No. Why-why would it be
a problem?

19:12.467 --> 19:15.333
(chuckles) If memory serves,
she was a summa cum laude cunt.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.567
Yeah, well, she was

19:16.567 --> 19:17.600
a lot of things.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.066
You even know
where she is?

19:19.066 --> 19:20.734
I have a phone number.
I'll make it happen.

19:20.734 --> 19:22.433
Uh-huh. I hope so.

19:22.433 --> 19:24.266
She's a joint claimant
on this thing.

19:24.266 --> 19:25.467
No Monica, no money.

19:25.467 --> 19:28.500
Hey, do me a favor.
Will you feed the dogs
before you go?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.667
Bag of dog food
in my desk drawer.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.633
Thanks, buddy.
Uh...

19:40.500 --> 19:42.367
(crunching)

19:42.367 --> 19:43.667
Mmm!

19:43.667 --> 19:45.400
All right, come on!

19:45.400 --> 19:46.633
(dogs barking)

19:46.633 --> 19:48.133
Get off of her!

19:48.133 --> 19:51.066
Hey, man, it's, uh, it's Lip.
I'm calling you

19:51.066 --> 19:52.100
from a phone booth.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.166
Just hit me back at whatever
number comes up

19:54.166 --> 19:57.300
on your cell, all right?
It's important.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.133
(phone rings)

20:04.066 --> 20:05.333
Hey, thanks
for taking long enough

20:05.333 --> 20:07.233
to let me enjoy
the scent of urine.

20:07.233 --> 20:09.633
Yeah, I didn't even know
that phone booths exist anymore.

20:09.633 --> 20:11.233
What's up? Sounded urgent.

20:11.233 --> 20:13.633
Yeah, um, I was just wondering,

20:13.633 --> 20:17.500
do you think you can loan me
a couple bills?

20:17.500 --> 20:20.000
I can pay for a job.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.233
You got a driver's license,
right?

20:21.233 --> 20:22.500
A few of 'em, yeah.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.333
All right, meet me by the L
at 11:00.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.000
Are you screwing
my sister's boyfriend?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.300
If you're selling cookies,

20:34.300 --> 20:36.333
that's a hell
of an opening line.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.133
Do come in.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Can I get you something? Milk?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.433
Soda?

20:52.433 --> 20:54.567
A joint?

20:54.567 --> 20:56.033
It's medicinal.

20:56.033 --> 20:58.300
No, thank you, Mrs. Lishman.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.400
How do you know Steve?

21:00.400 --> 21:03.333
Who is Steve?

21:03.333 --> 21:05.200
He's my sister's
boyfriend.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.300
How nice.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.734
So, he's not

21:08.734 --> 21:10.367
pushing it into you?

21:10.367 --> 21:13.233
(coughs)

21:13.233 --> 21:16.467
Hey, Mom, me and Chip are gonna
swing by the hospital

21:16.467 --> 21:19.734
to see Dad, so you
can relax now, okay?

21:19.734 --> 21:21.467
Oh! Thank you, Jimmy.

21:21.467 --> 21:23.700
You take such good care
of your mama bear.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.367
BOTH:
Mmm! Mmm!

21:27.667 --> 21:28.700
Oh! This is, uh...

21:28.700 --> 21:30.133
Debbie.

21:30.133 --> 21:31.300
Debbie Gallagher.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.467
Nice to meet you...

21:33.467 --> 21:35.133
Jimmy.

21:35.133 --> 21:37.567
Jimmy is my youngest.

21:37.567 --> 21:42.333
Top of his class at
Michigan in med school.

21:42.333 --> 21:46.600
He is going to be
a cardio-thoracic surgeon

21:46.600 --> 21:49.400
like his big brother
and his daddy.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.533
And he has been taking
such good care of me

21:51.533 --> 21:54.066
since his father went
into the hospital. (coughs)

21:54.066 --> 21:58.333
A fender bender;
broke his kneecap.

21:58.333 --> 22:02.400
And you know, doctors make
the worst patients.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.567
Oh, would you like to stay
for dinner, sweetheart?

22:05.567 --> 22:09.166
Oh shit!
I liked her.

22:09.166 --> 22:12.033
(phone line ringing)

22:12.033 --> 22:14.200
MUFFLED VOICE:
Hello? Hello?

22:15.700 --> 22:17.734
Shit. Shit.

22:17.734 --> 22:20.367
Shit, shit, shit!

22:20.367 --> 22:21.567
Frank?

22:24.066 --> 22:27.700
Frank, I-- I certainly hope
you're not pooping in there.

22:27.700 --> 22:30.467
It's a closet.

22:30.467 --> 22:33.000
Frank?

22:37.233 --> 22:38.767
You didn't poop
in there, did you?

22:38.767 --> 22:40.266
I was waiting

22:40.266 --> 22:42.367
to surprise you.
Oh.

22:43.433 --> 22:44.600
Surprise!
(screams)

22:44.600 --> 22:46.633
(laughing)

22:46.633 --> 22:49.767
You got me!

22:49.767 --> 22:51.567
Oh, Frankie.

22:51.567 --> 22:52.700
Hey, do me a favor?

22:52.700 --> 22:55.233
Call this number,

22:55.233 --> 22:58.500
and, and ask if
Monica is there.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.667
And if she is, tell her...

23:01.667 --> 23:03.000
Congratulations!

23:03.000 --> 23:04.433
She's won!

23:04.433 --> 23:05.734
Who's Monica?

23:05.734 --> 23:07.600
Doesn't matter.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.066
What'd she win?

23:09.066 --> 23:11.066
Uh... I don't know.

23:11.066 --> 23:14.233
Whatever.
Uh... a lottery, something.

23:14.233 --> 23:15.633
A lottery?
A prize.

23:15.633 --> 23:17.000
A teddy bear.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.400
What for?

23:19.400 --> 23:21.633
Jesus, with the
questions already!

23:21.633 --> 23:23.567
Just call, say..

23:23.567 --> 23:26.166
It's a teddy bear.
And a hundred bucks.

23:26.166 --> 23:29.133
And she has to pick it up.
Just say that.

23:31.133 --> 23:34.767
Well... I hope this Monica,

23:34.767 --> 23:38.266
whoever she is,

23:38.266 --> 23:42.300
worked really hard
for this prize.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.533
Sheils...
I didn't get a teddy bear!

23:46.533 --> 23:51.033
Sheils... Shit.

23:51.033 --> 23:52.734
(gentle knocking)

23:55.300 --> 23:58.300
Hey.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.567
Hey...

24:00.567 --> 24:03.367
Come on.

24:06.467 --> 24:10.400
She didn't really
win a teddy bear.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.700
But you want
to know what?
(Sheila sniffs)

24:12.700 --> 24:16.333
If I was giving away
teddy bears,

24:16.333 --> 24:19.367
you would be absolutely
top of the list.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.600
(Sheila sniffs, blows nose)

24:29.066 --> 24:30.767
(sniffling continues)

24:32.567 --> 24:34.600
(Frank humming)

24:38.467 --> 24:42.066
If you will do
this for me,

24:42.066 --> 24:46.600
I will dress up
any way you want,

24:46.600 --> 24:48.467
no safety word.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.734
Is this Monica?

24:55.200 --> 24:57.300
Well, hello. This is Sheila,

24:57.300 --> 24:59.567
from Market Promotions.

24:59.567 --> 25:03.533
Can I ask you where you do
all of your grocery shopping?

25:03.533 --> 25:07.100
Well, yes,
that's right!

25:07.100 --> 25:09.033
You've won!

25:09.033 --> 25:11.500
First prize!
Congratulations!

25:11.500 --> 25:14.266
It's $100.

25:14.266 --> 25:16.233
Yes. And, um...

25:16.233 --> 25:17.367
(very quietly):
What?
Teddy bear.

25:17.367 --> 25:19.166
(whispering):
Teddy bear.

25:19.166 --> 25:20.233
And, and a teddy bear.

25:20.233 --> 25:22.367
And a great big teddy bear.

25:24.633 --> 25:25.667
Hello?

25:25.667 --> 25:28.233
Yeah...

25:28.233 --> 25:30.100
She's crying.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.500
Oh, fuck.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.467
Oh, yeah, no, I've never
won anything either.

25:34.467 --> 25:35.767
Aw...

25:35.767 --> 25:37.367
It's so great.

25:37.367 --> 25:39.533
Yeah. I'm thrilled.

25:39.533 --> 25:41.133
I'm thrilled for you.

25:41.133 --> 25:43.200
Get to the
fucking point.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.033
Anyway, prizes will be given out

25:46.033 --> 25:47.400
at 3:00.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.500
At the store.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.066
Yes.

25:52.066 --> 25:56.066
WGN's own Tom Skilling
will be presenting.

25:59.667 --> 26:01.200
(whispering):
She doesn't know who
Tom Skilling is.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.166
I don't know
who fucking Tom...

26:03.166 --> 26:04.467
He does the weather.

26:04.467 --> 26:06.533
Tom Skilling, he does
the weather on WGN.

26:06.533 --> 26:08.333
(mutters angrily)
Anyway, 3:00 on the dot.

26:08.333 --> 26:11.533
Jim Ramsey might
be there, too.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

26:11.533 --> 26:13.533
He does weekend weather.

26:13.533 --> 26:14.667
Okay... okay...

26:14.667 --> 26:16.533
Congratulations!
See you there, Monica!

26:16.533 --> 26:19.633
What did she say?
Is she, is she, is she coming?

26:19.633 --> 26:22.166
How can you not know who two
of Chicago's weathermen are?

26:22.166 --> 26:23.500
What kind of person
is this Monica?

26:23.500 --> 26:27.100
Is she coming to get
the fucking prize or not?

26:27.100 --> 26:29.433
Yeah. She--
oh, she's going.

26:29.433 --> 26:30.734
She's...

26:30.734 --> 26:32.500
she's excited about
that teddy bear.

26:44.166 --> 26:47.266
You know, not sure
I can prove it, but...

26:47.266 --> 26:49.233
I think it's colder
on the North Side.

26:51.367 --> 26:53.300
Let me take you home, Debs.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.166
I'm not supposed to
take rides from strangers.

26:56.166 --> 26:58.300
And it's clear that
you are a stranger.

26:58.300 --> 27:01.300
Oh, man.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.600
Are you gonna
tell Fiona?

27:03.600 --> 27:05.734
Exactly what am I
supposed to tell her?

27:05.734 --> 27:08.600
That your name
isn't Steve?

27:08.600 --> 27:11.367
That you have a family
in Chicago she's never met?

27:11.367 --> 27:13.467
Or that your mom
kisses you on the lips?

27:13.467 --> 27:15.266
Which is really gross,
by the way.

27:15.266 --> 27:18.100
Life gets really complicated
when you're an adult.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.266
I mean, you can't
possibly understand

27:20.266 --> 27:21.500
these things right now.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.667
I understand that you
lied to my sister.

27:25.667 --> 27:28.166
Why?

27:28.166 --> 27:30.467
Because I was raised
by a pack of wolves.

27:30.467 --> 27:32.333
Just like you were.

27:32.333 --> 27:34.667
Only my wolves
went to Harvard.

27:34.667 --> 27:36.767
You know they have Red Wolves
at Lincoln Park Zoo.

27:36.767 --> 27:39.066
Maybe we could go
check them out sometime.

27:39.066 --> 27:40.467
Trying to distract me

27:40.467 --> 27:42.467
by asking me out
on a date?

27:42.467 --> 27:44.367
I do not want to be a doctor.

27:44.367 --> 27:46.734
I do not want to be like
the rest of my family.

27:46.734 --> 27:49.000
What I want is Fiona.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.533
I love her!

27:50.533 --> 27:53.367
Love is fleeting, Jimmy.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.200
What are your intentions?

27:55.200 --> 27:56.734
You're distracting her,

27:56.734 --> 27:59.333
and I need her in the game
for at least a few more years.

27:59.333 --> 28:02.166
I can't have you
breaking her heart,

28:02.166 --> 28:03.500
or running off with her.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.734
So if you're not serious
about sticking around,

28:05.734 --> 28:07.533
back off now.

28:07.533 --> 28:10.467
I bought her a house.

28:10.467 --> 28:12.500
Is that
serious enough?

28:12.500 --> 28:14.367
You what?

28:14.367 --> 28:16.767
Come on.
I'll show you.

28:28.100 --> 28:31.033
Really?
Yeah.

28:31.033 --> 28:32.633
Yes! Yes!

28:32.633 --> 28:34.333
DEBBIE: This was
Mr. Harris's house.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.734
They said he died
of lung cancer,

28:35.734 --> 28:37.667
but we're all pretty sure
it was full-blown AIDS.

28:40.433 --> 28:44.000
(laughing):
Oh. My. God.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.567
Has Fiona seen it?

28:45.567 --> 28:47.166
No, she doesn't
know about it yet.

28:47.166 --> 28:48.767
I was going to, you know,
fix it up a bit,

28:48.767 --> 28:50.567
and surprise her
when the time is right.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.700
Think we could build
an above-ground walkway

28:54.700 --> 28:56.400
that connects the two houses?

28:56.400 --> 28:57.533
What, like
a Habitrail tube?

28:57.533 --> 28:59.600
(gasps)
That would be awesome.

29:00.700 --> 29:03.066
Are you going to tell Fiona?

29:06.133 --> 29:08.600
Don't know yet, Jimmy.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.400
Saw a really cool
pink vest at the mall.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.033
Really?

29:13.033 --> 29:15.734
And I could use a new
rolling pin and flour sifter.

29:15.734 --> 29:18.266
Sheila's teaching me
how to bake.

29:18.266 --> 29:19.633
Anything else?

29:22.300 --> 29:24.166
Not for the moment.

29:24.166 --> 29:25.467
So...

29:25.467 --> 29:28.333
which room will be mine
when I sleep over?

29:30.166 --> 29:32.233
(phone rings)

29:32.233 --> 29:33.166
(ring stops)

29:39.667 --> 29:42.333
Not going out with that
Gallagher degenerate tonight?

29:43.300 --> 29:45.333
Good.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.667
You deserve better.

29:47.667 --> 29:50.066
I've been reading more about
this Purity Ball thing.

29:50.066 --> 29:51.400
It says here you can

29:51.400 --> 29:53.300
"re-dedicate yourself
as a virgin."

29:53.300 --> 29:55.734
Start over.
Isn't that nice?

29:59.500 --> 30:03.100
I mean, you show up,
confess your transgressions,

30:03.100 --> 30:05.767
and pledge yourself to be pure
again, in the eyes of the Lord.

30:09.066 --> 30:10.600
I'll give you
the damn car.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.133
Really?

30:25.233 --> 30:26.600
Fiona would be pissed

30:26.600 --> 30:28.667
if she knew you were
into this shit with me.

30:30.367 --> 30:34.266
LIP:
Well, what she doesn't know
won't hurt her, right?

30:34.266 --> 30:36.266
All right.
Task at hand.

30:36.266 --> 30:37.633
You'll be driving
the follow car.

30:37.633 --> 30:40.133
The golden rule:
always use a follow car.

30:40.133 --> 30:42.467
Nice silver Mercedes.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.500
Nice security camera
at the intersection.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.500
Wait, why don't we head up
to some asshole town,

30:46.500 --> 30:48.367
like Lake Forest? Plenty of
douche-mobiles up there.
No.

30:48.367 --> 30:50.500
No, I was just thinking
that, you know...
Listen, no.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.333
200 bucks to follow me
after I lift the car,

30:53.333 --> 30:55.467
you get your concert tickets,
I get my work done.

30:55.467 --> 30:57.700
That's it. Okay?
All right, man.

31:02.633 --> 31:05.100
Shit.

31:05.100 --> 31:07.000
Rule number two:

31:07.000 --> 31:10.567
always remember where
you park the follow car.

31:23.166 --> 31:25.266
Fuck.

31:40.300 --> 31:43.000
Monica.

31:55.734 --> 31:58.133
Monica?

32:16.700 --> 32:19.300
Deb.

32:19.300 --> 32:22.233
Jimmy.

32:22.233 --> 32:24.734
Fiona's next door
with Liam.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.567
That my "shut-up gift"?

32:27.567 --> 32:30.633
Well, I like to think of it
as a peace offering.

32:30.633 --> 32:32.266
Peace offering

32:32.266 --> 32:34.266
implies a one-time thing.

32:34.266 --> 32:36.467
This could take a while.

32:36.467 --> 32:38.033
How long?

32:38.033 --> 32:42.033
Till I'm sure that
you're not still lying.

32:42.033 --> 32:45.767
Okay. I gotta get back
up to Lake Forest.

32:45.767 --> 32:47.133
They're releasing my dad
from the hospital.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.200
I'm gonna pick him up,
I'm gonna take him home.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.333
You know everything there is
to know. No more secrets.

32:52.333 --> 32:54.400
I promise.

32:57.066 --> 32:59.533
Sifter sifts, and
rolling pin rolls.

32:59.533 --> 33:02.533
Nice when things do
what the say they will.

33:09.467 --> 33:12.200
Jimmy.
Steve.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.300
Is this your idea
of a joke, huh?

33:14.300 --> 33:18.066
'Cause you're scared of women
with an opinion, yeah?

33:18.066 --> 33:20.633
Yeah, watch this crinkle-dick.

33:20.633 --> 33:23.600
I'll show you what's
funny when I rip
your fucking face

33:23.600 --> 33:25.367
off your fuckin' head!

33:25.367 --> 33:28.367
Out of the way, Monica!

33:28.367 --> 33:33.266
Get out of the way now!
MONICA:
Put the shovel down. Please!

33:35.433 --> 33:36.367
I'm sorry.

33:36.367 --> 33:38.166
Who lies about
a teddy bear?

33:38.166 --> 33:40.367
Wasting my
fucking time.

33:40.367 --> 33:42.433
Are you sure this is
even the right store?
Yes.

33:42.433 --> 33:44.567
They specifically
said this store?

33:44.567 --> 33:46.100
Yes, I told you yes.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.467
I wrote it down.
I wrote everything down.

33:48.467 --> 33:51.233
Stop talking to me
like I'm stupid.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.066
(sighs)

33:56.066 --> 33:58.333
(sniffles)

33:58.333 --> 34:01.500
Frank?

34:01.500 --> 34:05.266
Frank!
What?!

34:05.266 --> 34:08.000
Frank!

34:08.000 --> 34:10.533
(engine starting)

34:12.100 --> 34:13.266
Start the car!

34:13.266 --> 34:15.065
What?

34:15.065 --> 34:17.266
(engine starting)
Go, go, go!

34:17.266 --> 34:19.033
What the fuck, Frank?
She saw me.

34:19.033 --> 34:21.065
What's going on?

34:21.065 --> 34:23.734
Come on, we gotta
get outta here! Go!

34:32.065 --> 34:34.033
I'm gonna rip it off
when I catch you!

34:37.400 --> 34:38.567
Can't this piece of shit

34:38.567 --> 34:40.166
go any faster?!
No.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.667
Monica's batting
for the other team.

34:42.667 --> 34:44.734
What?!
My wife's a fucking lesbian!

34:44.734 --> 34:46.166
KEVIN:
Shit!

34:48.632 --> 34:50.166
(truck horn blares)

34:50.166 --> 34:51.699
Hmph!

34:51.699 --> 34:56.065
♪ You're gonna look over, you
never know what you'll find... ♪

35:00.033 --> 35:01.166
Go! Go!
Shut up, Frank!

35:01.166 --> 35:03.233
Go! Go!

35:04.467 --> 35:08.533
♪ But we'll stop,
but we'll stop ♪

35:08.533 --> 35:09.667
♪ But we'll stop! ♪

35:09.667 --> 35:12.266
FRANK:
Fuck off, lesbos!

35:12.266 --> 35:13.567
(laughing)

35:13.567 --> 35:16.700
I would say my advice
to you would be

35:16.700 --> 35:19.600
to let Fiona live in
her own relationship.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.166
You can't do it for her.

35:21.166 --> 35:23.066
There's things
you should know.

35:23.066 --> 35:26.467
Well, sometimes, sweetie,
when people are in love,

35:26.467 --> 35:29.767
they don't tell someone
everything for a reason.

35:29.767 --> 35:31.600
That's like lying.

35:31.600 --> 35:37.133
No, sweetie, it's just--
it's a little editing.

35:37.133 --> 35:40.567
Now the sifting. See?

35:40.567 --> 35:43.600
We separate and aerate
those flour particles

35:43.600 --> 35:46.367
to make them absorb
liquids better.

35:46.367 --> 35:48.734
Someone should
sift my dad.

35:48.734 --> 35:50.533
(chuckles)

35:50.533 --> 35:52.467
Oh, you Gallaghers.

35:52.467 --> 35:53.533
You're all so funny.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.133
KEVIN:
Frank!

35:56.133 --> 35:57.200
This is bullshit, Frank!

35:57.200 --> 35:58.667
FRANK: Bar the door!
Lock the door!

35:58.667 --> 36:00.734
What is happening?!

36:00.734 --> 36:01.600
It's okay, Sheila.
It's just my dad.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.633
I thought we lost 'em.

36:03.633 --> 36:05.066
Did you even have
a plan back there?

36:05.066 --> 36:09.066
I was going to charm her
into signing once she was there.

36:09.066 --> 36:11.100
How the hell was I
supposed to know

36:11.100 --> 36:15.266
she would show up
with ghetto Godzilla
in a Peterbilt.

36:15.266 --> 36:17.700
I am seriously this close
to punching you in the dick.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.767
(truck approaching)

36:30.000 --> 36:32.400
Get...
They're just girls.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.000
Stop. You talk to them.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.333
I need the key
to the back door.

36:37.333 --> 36:38.767
That is not a sexual
euphemism.

36:38.767 --> 36:41.633
I need the fucking key.
What did you do with it?

36:41.633 --> 36:45.100
I-I-I don't know. I can't think
when you yell, Frank.
I'm not yelling.

36:45.100 --> 36:46.633
What'd you do with the key?
You're still yelling.

36:46.633 --> 36:48.233
I need the key, Sheila.

36:48.233 --> 36:51.400
Okay, okay, it's by the--
it's by the--

36:51.400 --> 36:53.734
it's by the washing machine.
It's not by
the washing machine.

36:53.734 --> 36:55.734
Yes, it is. I put it

36:55.734 --> 36:57.533
by the washing
machine.
It's not by the...

36:57.533 --> 37:00.000
Mom.

37:01.633 --> 37:05.433
It-it's Mom.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.700
Debbie.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.166
Oh, my sweet pea.

37:35.333 --> 37:37.000
What the fuck

37:37.000 --> 37:39.033
are you looking at?!

37:43.567 --> 37:46.066
Hey, look, I got nothing
to do with it, all right?

37:46.066 --> 37:47.066
I'm just the driver.
Sit.

37:47.066 --> 37:48.333
Sit your ass down.

37:51.734 --> 37:53.500
Oh...

37:53.500 --> 37:57.300
That was a nasty trick.

37:57.300 --> 38:00.600
Even for you, Frank.

38:00.600 --> 38:03.133
I had my heart set
on that teddy bear.

38:03.133 --> 38:04.734
Oh, poor Monica.

38:04.734 --> 38:06.200
Well, what about your kids?!

38:06.200 --> 38:08.266
Remember?

38:08.266 --> 38:10.033
The six kids?

38:10.033 --> 38:11.600
Youngest was only
two months old

38:11.600 --> 38:12.734
before you ran off.

38:12.734 --> 38:15.266
Ended up with--
fucking Shrek here.

38:15.266 --> 38:17.000
You want me to step
in here, Moni?

38:17.000 --> 38:20.033
No, I didn't leave you, Frank.

38:20.033 --> 38:23.000
Yes, you did.
I didn't choose

38:23.000 --> 38:24.133
to leave my family.

38:24.133 --> 38:25.667
You almost destroyed me.

38:25.667 --> 38:27.767
When I turned up at
Roberta's that night,

38:27.767 --> 38:29.700
I was an...
BOTH:
Emotional cripple!

38:29.700 --> 38:31.133
Oh, bullshit.

38:31.133 --> 38:32.700
With not one ounce
of self-respect.

38:32.700 --> 38:35.000
You almost destroyed me.
I'm gonna start crying.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.734
You drove me into
the ground, Frank.

38:36.734 --> 38:40.200
You-you robbed me
of any sense of dignity

38:40.200 --> 38:41.633
I ever had,

38:41.633 --> 38:43.233
and...

38:45.100 --> 38:46.467
Where's the rest
of the kids?

38:46.467 --> 38:47.467
They're out playing.

38:47.467 --> 38:49.367
They live down
at Fiona's.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.033
You mind putting
some bags on?

38:53.033 --> 38:57.233
Can you-- can you
put some bags on your feet?
Bags on my feet?

38:57.233 --> 39:00.033
Take your shoes off.
SHEILA:
I need you to put bags on.

39:17.367 --> 39:18.467
Don't, don't don't.

39:18.467 --> 39:21.233
Hell hath no fury
like popcorn burned.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.567
Is Steve coming?
Hope so.

39:23.567 --> 39:27.100
Are you guys going to make
a baby while we watch Cosmos?

39:27.100 --> 39:28.734
'Cause that's going
to make me throw up.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.500
Billions and billions
of sperm.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.066
Ew!

39:32.066 --> 39:33.667
Steve, please turn it on
already.

39:33.667 --> 39:35.467
Yeah, hurry up.

39:35.467 --> 39:37.633
I gotta get back to work.
Ooh!

39:37.633 --> 39:39.133
Cool.

39:39.133 --> 39:41.166
Hey.

39:41.166 --> 39:42.633
...and what our faith may be.

39:42.633 --> 39:46.000
Missed you, stranger.
You, too.

39:47.633 --> 39:50.400
Get a room.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.066
Get your tickets?
LIPS:
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

39:52.066 --> 39:54.266
Glad I could help.

39:54.266 --> 39:55.467
Glad you're glad.

39:55.467 --> 39:57.033
Steve.

39:57.033 --> 39:59.000
and birds...

39:59.000 --> 40:02.367
Oh, this popcorn's burnt.
Our microwave sucks.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.467
That doesn't mean I want
you to buy us a new one.

40:04.467 --> 40:06.266
...the universe is
smaller than atoms.

40:06.266 --> 40:11.734
But it's also the story
of our own planet.
Debs?

40:11.734 --> 40:12.700
Honey, what happened?

40:12.700 --> 40:16.266
LIP: What, Dad have
one too many again?

40:16.266 --> 40:19.133
You just got to ignore him
when he's like that, Debs.

40:19.133 --> 40:22.100
Why do you always
blame Dad first?

40:22.100 --> 40:25.166
Who else is there?

40:25.166 --> 40:27.433
She's over at Sheila's.

40:27.433 --> 40:29.166
Who?

40:29.166 --> 40:31.567
Monica.

40:31.567 --> 40:36.166
... relationships of the
awesome machinery of nature.

40:36.166 --> 40:38.633
Who the hell is Monica?

40:38.633 --> 40:40.700
Her mother.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.700
...on this shore,
we've learned...

40:42.700 --> 40:45.567
FIONA:
Debs.

40:45.567 --> 40:47.600
What do you care?!

40:47.600 --> 40:51.333
You'll be living with
Steve in that house
he bought next door!

40:52.734 --> 40:55.500
...some part of
our being knows...

40:58.066 --> 40:59.500
Surprise.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.734
...because the cosmos
is also within us.

41:03.734 --> 41:07.133
We're made of star stuff.

41:07.133 --> 41:09.633
I'm going to work.
Ian, come on, wait.

41:12.300 --> 41:15.133
Mommy! Mommy!

41:15.133 --> 41:16.333
I know.

41:16.333 --> 41:21.467
Mommy!
Mommy!

41:21.467 --> 41:25.767
Worlds of ice
and stars of diamonds.

41:25.767 --> 41:27.367
Atoms and masses...

41:39.600 --> 41:41.100
What the fuck?

41:41.100 --> 41:42.333
I need to see you.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.400
Not a good time.
MAN:
Who keeps hanging

41:44.400 --> 41:46.500
their fucking laundry
on my pull-up bar?!

41:46.500 --> 41:49.400
I-I-I don't know
where else to go.

41:49.400 --> 41:52.300
I thought you were
working today.

41:52.300 --> 41:55.433
Uh, Linda's gonna
have my ass.

41:55.433 --> 41:59.133
I'm supposed
to be there now.

41:59.133 --> 42:00.700
I'll meet you
there in 20.

42:04.467 --> 42:06.200
Oh, bullshit!

42:06.200 --> 42:08.500
You physically
abused me.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.100
What?! When?!

42:10.100 --> 42:11.300
The Fourth of July.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.633
Oh, come on, you
hit me in the face

42:13.633 --> 42:15.567
with a tray of apple pan dowdy.

42:15.567 --> 42:17.367
And you hit me back.

42:17.367 --> 42:20.500
Yeah, after you broke my nose
and scratched my cornea.

42:20.500 --> 42:21.567
Oh, yeah? What about this?

42:21.567 --> 42:24.233
Oh, come on, you
started that one.

42:24.233 --> 42:26.166
And I'll finish it
if you lay a finger on her.

42:26.166 --> 42:27.500
SHEILA:
Roberta...

42:27.500 --> 42:28.667
Bob. Only Moni
called me Roberta.

42:28.667 --> 42:33.400
All right, well Bob,
we're just in the way here

42:33.400 --> 42:36.166
and we should
make our exit

42:36.166 --> 42:39.433
and leave Monica
for her apologies.

42:39.433 --> 42:40.567
Apologies?

42:40.567 --> 42:41.700
For walking out

42:41.700 --> 42:43.266
on this piece of shit?

42:43.266 --> 42:46.200
No, for walking
out on them.

42:51.767 --> 42:54.433
Oh, my God.

42:54.433 --> 42:56.567
It's all right.
I'm not one of yours.

42:56.567 --> 42:58.133
Just came
to rubberneck.

43:06.300 --> 43:08.467
Alhamdu lillah!

43:08.467 --> 43:10.667
Ian, I did it.

43:10.667 --> 43:12.300
Linda's pregnant.

43:12.300 --> 43:15.000
Ian. Finally knocked her up.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.300
Where are you?
I did it.

43:16.300 --> 43:18.166
It's over.

43:26.166 --> 43:28.600
What the fuck?!

43:40.667 --> 43:43.633
Sign the name! Sign the name!

43:46.567 --> 43:50.600
MONICA:
You're all so big.

43:50.600 --> 43:53.767
I missed you so much.

43:53.767 --> 43:57.600
Well, why didn't you
take us with you?

43:59.467 --> 44:01.467
MONICA:
Because...

44:03.367 --> 44:06.367
I knew you'd be fine
with Fiona.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.567
Fucking right you
keep your mouth shut.

44:39.433 --> 44:42.166
You better keep it shut.

44:44.100 --> 44:45.400
You hear me?

44:45.400 --> 44:49.100
Put the candy back, Mickey.

44:53.233 --> 44:55.600
Mm. That's sweet.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.233
I like 'em sweet.

44:58.166 --> 45:01.633
But then, uh...

45:01.633 --> 45:03.633
so do you, huh?

45:03.633 --> 45:04.734
(laughing):
Huh?

45:04.734 --> 45:07.333
Put it back.

45:07.333 --> 45:09.233
Now.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.734
Fuck!

45:15.066 --> 45:17.200
Kash, what are you doing?

45:17.200 --> 45:19.033
It's a fucking Snickers bar!

45:20.266 --> 45:21.667
Fuck!

45:21.667 --> 45:22.567
IAN:
Holy shit!

45:22.567 --> 45:26.300
MICKEY:
Jesus Chr...!

45:26.300 --> 45:27.600
You okay?
Fuck!

45:29.000 --> 45:32.533
Hey, hey, listen to me.
You fuckin' suck!

45:39.266 --> 45:42.233
Thought you were at work.

45:42.233 --> 45:44.400
There was a shooting.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.400
Mickey and Kash.

45:46.400 --> 45:49.166
Holy shit, Mickey shot Kash?

45:49.166 --> 45:51.467
Kash shot Mickey.
What?

45:51.467 --> 45:53.767
In the leg. He's fine.

45:53.767 --> 45:57.233
I just wanted to get out of
there before the cops got there.

45:57.233 --> 45:59.633
What'd I miss with Mom?

45:59.633 --> 46:03.033
Well, you know how Dad's
a total fucking asshole?

46:03.033 --> 46:04.433
Yeah.

46:04.433 --> 46:07.533
Turns out he's the good one.

46:07.533 --> 46:10.734
Oh, I can't believe you sucked
me back in here for money!

46:10.734 --> 46:13.000
I did no such thing.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.467
But since you're in town,
why don't you sign up for
this little thing

46:16.467 --> 46:19.300
and I will cut you in...
Oh, fuck you, Frank!

46:19.300 --> 46:21.066
Wait, you brought
her back here?

46:21.066 --> 46:22.600
Oh, Ian.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.533
Wait, you knew where
she was the whole time?

46:25.533 --> 46:27.367
Okay, look, this little reunion

46:27.367 --> 46:29.433
was bound to happen
sooner or later anyway.

46:29.433 --> 46:32.567
We were thinking about
coming around to talk to
you about something else.

46:32.567 --> 46:34.600
No, no...
Yes, now.
Yes, now.

46:34.600 --> 46:37.233
Moni and I want to take
Liam to live with us.

46:37.233 --> 46:38.233
What?!

46:38.233 --> 46:39.734
Over my dead body.

46:39.734 --> 46:42.266
How about Moni sign whatever
the hell it is you need--

46:42.266 --> 46:44.066
we get Liam.
Done.

46:44.066 --> 46:45.767
No fucking way!
You can't have Liam.

46:45.767 --> 46:48.300
Why the hell not?

46:48.300 --> 46:50.133
He's not even Frank's.
Fact is,

46:50.133 --> 46:52.066
Liam is black.

46:52.066 --> 46:55.033
All you white folks
scooping up black babies
like fashion accessories

46:55.033 --> 46:57.066
have a rude awakening coming.

46:57.066 --> 46:59.567
There will be a backlash
if people don't stop

46:59.567 --> 47:01.600
underestimating the
cultural importance

47:01.600 --> 47:03.767
of a black parent

47:03.767 --> 47:06.333
raising a black baby.

47:06.333 --> 47:08.700
Liam needs me
and he's coming with us.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.333
Out of the fucking
question, Roberta.

47:10.333 --> 47:13.033
Roberta and I want to
start a family of our own.

47:13.033 --> 47:15.200
Well, how about you
finish this one first.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.233
(sobbing):
They're taking Liam?

47:16.233 --> 47:18.000
No!
Yes!

47:18.000 --> 47:20.066
No, nobody's taking
anyone anywhere.

47:20.066 --> 47:21.100
You don't get

47:21.100 --> 47:23.433
to abandon your kids
and then show up one day

47:23.433 --> 47:25.767
to take your pick of the litter.

47:25.767 --> 47:27.400
Oh, now that's not fair.

47:27.400 --> 47:28.433
Your mother's made mistakes,

47:28.433 --> 47:30.333
but she's here now.

47:30.333 --> 47:34.333
That's got to count
for something.
FIONA: Shut up, Frank!

47:34.333 --> 47:35.767
This isn't about you.

47:35.767 --> 47:37.767
This is about you.

47:37.767 --> 47:41.400
This is about what
you didn't do.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.367
It's about what I did.

47:43.367 --> 47:45.166
And you know what?

47:45.166 --> 47:47.734
I did a fucking great job.

47:47.734 --> 47:50.100
Debbie is class president.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.767
She's on the debate team,
going to nationals.

47:52.767 --> 47:55.367
And Lip, he's top
of his class.

47:55.367 --> 47:57.433
He set the curve.

47:57.433 --> 47:59.600
Ian was promoted in ROTC

47:59.600 --> 48:01.667
and he tested out of English.

48:01.667 --> 48:05.133
And Carl made something
blow up for his science fair.

48:05.133 --> 48:08.667
And you know what,
they did it all,
no thanks to you!

48:08.667 --> 48:10.433
Because you weren't here!

48:10.433 --> 48:11.667
And I appreciate that, Fiona.

48:11.667 --> 48:16.333
But I'm here now.

48:16.333 --> 48:17.266
And Liam

48:17.266 --> 48:19.667
belongs with me.

48:19.667 --> 48:21.367
He doesn't even
know who you are.

48:21.367 --> 48:24.400
I'm his mother!
You were my mother, too!

48:28.600 --> 48:30.400
LIAM: I don't!
I don't know!

48:30.400 --> 48:31.533
MONICA:
Maybe I'll never be able

48:31.533 --> 48:34.500
to make things right with you--

48:34.500 --> 48:38.467
but there's still
time with Liam.

48:38.467 --> 48:42.166
And Debbie and Carl,

48:42.166 --> 48:45.500
I am so sorry if I hurt you.

48:45.500 --> 48:49.700
See, I love you so much.

48:49.700 --> 48:51.734
Please let me be
your mommy again. Please?

49:02.567 --> 49:04.433
(gasps)

49:06.300 --> 49:07.367
You know what?

49:07.367 --> 49:11.433
You're right.

49:11.433 --> 49:13.633
You are their mother.

49:13.633 --> 49:16.633
And you're here now.

49:16.633 --> 49:18.166
(sniffs)
So I'm done.

49:18.166 --> 49:22.333
I'm done with the school
and the bills and the clinics.

49:22.333 --> 49:24.767
I'm done.

49:24.767 --> 49:27.400
They're all yours now, Mom.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.533
Good luck.

49:35.467 --> 49:36.767
(speaking quietly)
