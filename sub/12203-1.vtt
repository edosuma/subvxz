00:41.077 --> 00:43.480
- Good morning.
- Hello.

00:48.919 --> 00:50.121
Who do we have here?

00:50.221 --> 00:53.925
He belongs to Robert Wade,
the new president of the giant mine.

00:54.025 --> 00:57.432
He's just cleared quarantine and he's going
up with the rest of the cargo with you.

00:57.712 --> 01:00.332
Okay. Well, you are a beauty?

01:00.432 --> 01:03.968
We don't get breeds like this up here.
There you go.

01:06.939 --> 01:09.541
Chinook. That's an interesting name.

01:09.641 --> 01:14.046
Okay, I'll bet your family's gonna be glad
to see you. Right, let's get him aboard.

01:22.522 --> 01:23.623
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

01:23.723 --> 01:27.062
I'm Mandisa. And you must be Ryan?
And you must be Emma.

01:27.162 --> 01:29.663
- Yep.
- We've been expecting you.

01:29.763 --> 01:33.001
The plane is being loaded
and you will be leaving very soon.

01:33.101 --> 01:35.969
- Okay, cool.
- Tell me, how do you find Africa so far?

01:36.069 --> 01:38.990
- Well, I haven't seen that much yet.
- I think it's awesome.

01:39.090 --> 01:41.325
Well, come with me.

01:46.881 --> 01:48.752
Hey, Kruger.

01:50.351 --> 01:54.057
These are the Croft children. Ryan and Emma.

01:54.791 --> 01:58.349
- We're not children.
- Ryan. Don't be rude.

01:58.729 --> 02:03.333
Okay. Mr. Croft, sir,
what say we get your bags onboard.

02:21.249 --> 02:23.956
There's a giant dog in the back.

02:24.056 --> 02:27.294
He's beautiful. He looks like a husky.

02:27.394 --> 02:29.495
Actually, he's a Malamute.

02:29.595 --> 02:32.432
Cool. Hey, boy, how are you?

02:39.472 --> 02:41.108
Kruger.

02:45.346 --> 02:49.517
We've had a report come in about possible
rebel activity along the border.

02:49.617 --> 02:53.022
Maybe you should delay
the flight until tomorrow.

02:53.122 --> 02:56.893
I think we'll be okay. I'll get up there
and then I can steer clear of the border.

02:56.993 --> 02:59.878
Okay. Just make sure you keep
constant radio contact.

02:59.978 --> 03:02.449
I will do. I'll see you in four hours.

03:44.277 --> 03:47.514
- Are you kids ready to see some wildlife?
- Yeah. You bet I am.

03:47.614 --> 03:49.782
Yeah, awesome. What will we see?

03:49.882 --> 03:53.255
Just sit tight,
Africa always offers a few surprises.

04:01.495 --> 04:04.432
- Don't forget clean underwear.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:04.532 --> 04:07.403
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, mister.
The van's going to be here in a few minutes.

04:07.503 --> 04:10.638
- I'll be ready.
- Clean socks, too?

04:10.738 --> 04:12.108
Man.

04:12.208 --> 04:15.545
- Be nice to your sister while you're away.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:15.645 --> 04:18.910
What did I just say about the "yeah, yeahs"?

04:21.983 --> 04:25.556
- Hey. How's it going in here?
- Great. I'm almost ready.

04:26.624 --> 04:28.960
Honey, you know you're just
going for the weekend, right?

04:29.060 --> 04:31.894
I know, but I still need a lot of stuff.

04:31.994 --> 04:34.331
Okay. Well, hopefully you can get it all in.

04:34.431 --> 04:37.168
And try to get along with Ryan.

04:37.268 --> 04:39.338
He can be such a dweeb, Mom.

04:39.438 --> 04:42.341
Hey, come on. None of that kind of talk.

04:55.688 --> 04:57.574
Hey, is your name really Kruger?

04:57.674 --> 05:01.128
Yes. It's Roger Kruger.
Everyone just calls me Kruger.

05:01.228 --> 05:03.931
Cool. Just like in the movies.

05:05.031 --> 05:08.289
Cut it out, Ryan. No one wants to hear
about those stupid horror movies.

05:08.389 --> 05:10.938
They're not stupid. I like them.

05:11.038 --> 05:13.407
You also like pro wrestling.

05:14.507 --> 05:16.511
Okay, kids, look down
to the right of the plane

05:16.611 --> 05:18.492
I'm going to try and come in
a bit lower for you.

05:25.454 --> 05:28.058
Oh, my gosh, look at that.

05:30.526 --> 05:34.263
Did you know elephants can go through
up to six sets of teeth in their lifetime?

05:34.363 --> 05:35.631
I didn't know that.

05:35.731 --> 05:39.770
If Ryan doesn't start brushing his teeth
more, he'll need another set of teeth.

05:53.953 --> 05:57.589
Okay, now look down the left
side of the plane. Giraffes.

05:58.589 --> 06:02.148
They're so neat! They're amazing-looking.

06:02.248 --> 06:04.031
So cool.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.801
And did you know, even a giraffe's
tongue is long? About 21 inches.

06:07.901 --> 06:12.540
That's so interesting.
Hey, Ryan, why was the giraffe late?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.908
I don't know.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.812
Because he was caught in a "giraffic" jam.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.836
Lame. So lame.

06:31.527 --> 06:33.696
So you kids are gonna go see your dad?

06:33.796 --> 06:36.594
Yeah. He's one of the
vice-presidents at the mine.

06:36.694 --> 06:39.903
- Big wheel?
- I guess you could say that.

06:40.003 --> 06:43.917
Well, that's the new president's dog
back there so you better be nice to him.

06:44.017 --> 06:47.195
- What's his name?
- His tag says Chinook.

06:47.295 --> 06:48.773
I wish we had a dog.

07:02.460 --> 07:05.652
Oh, my gosh, look at the zebras!
There are so many of them.

07:09.835 --> 07:11.927
Beautiful creatures?

07:13.773 --> 07:16.542
Do you have any facts
to tell us about zebras?

07:16.642 --> 07:19.432
Not really. Horses with stripes,
that's about all I know.

07:19.532 --> 07:21.716
They're running with their friends,
the wildebeest.

07:24.468 --> 07:28.641
Hey. Why don't you tell us
another one of your lame jokes?

07:29.591 --> 07:31.726
I don't know any zebra jokes.

07:40.102 --> 07:42.571
Hey, Mr. Kruger, look at that.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.208
Yeah, looks like a bit
of bad weather up ahead.

07:45.308 --> 07:48.096
We're gonna have to change
our course slightly just to avoid it.

07:54.383 --> 07:57.621
This time of year the weather
can change in a heartbeat.

08:20.913 --> 08:22.916
What was that?

08:24.316 --> 08:27.496
Mayday! Mayday! This is flight 280...

08:27.596 --> 08:31.091
Kruger! Kruger! Come in, please!

08:31.191 --> 08:35.260
- What is your position? Over.
- <i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

08:36.227 --> 08:39.566
Put your heads between your legs.
Brace for impact.

08:41.701 --> 08:44.938
Flight ZS280! Position please!

08:48.742 --> 08:52.280
Kruger! Kruger! Come in, please.

08:52.380 --> 08:54.694
What is your position? Over.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.461
Emma! Emma! Wake up, there's a fire.

09:16.561 --> 09:19.144
Emma, wake up. There's a fire.

10:03.057 --> 10:06.260
Mr. Kruger! Mr. Kruger!

10:06.360 --> 10:08.832
Come on, we need to get you out of here!

10:12.423 --> 10:16.480
Okay. Mr. Kruger,
we need to get you out of here.

10:18.881 --> 10:20.944
Emma, help!

10:32.656 --> 10:35.254
Careful. Careful.

10:59.352 --> 11:01.011
Ryan.

11:02.116 --> 11:04.128
Ryan, the dog.

11:14.836 --> 11:17.040
Emma, catch these packs!

11:21.150 --> 11:23.123
Come on, we gotta get you out of here!

11:27.717 --> 11:29.130
Come on!

11:39.462 --> 11:41.758
Go. Come, go.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.116
Ryan.

11:58.316 --> 11:59.983
Ryan.

12:00.337 --> 12:03.459
- Ryan? Ryan!
- I'm okay.

12:03.885 --> 12:05.559
Ryan.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.098
- I'm okay.
- What happened?

12:12.198 --> 12:15.504
I heard a loud explosion
and we were crashing.

12:16.704 --> 12:18.950
We need to check on Mr. Kruger.

12:23.879 --> 12:26.215
Mr. Kruger, are you okay?

12:26.315 --> 12:29.684
My head. My leg. I'm in a great deal of pain.

12:29.784 --> 12:32.221
Mr. Kruger, what should we do?

12:32.521 --> 12:36.292
Quickly make a fire from
the burning debris before it goes out.

12:36.392 --> 12:39.298
Gather wood and sticks. Hurry.

13:06.325 --> 13:09.695
Good. Good boy. You must keep the fire going.

13:10.395 --> 13:13.567
It's the only way to fend off lions.
They'll come tonight.

13:13.867 --> 13:17.250
Lions? Ryan, he said lions.

13:17.670 --> 13:21.441
Mr. Kruger, when will
the searchers come for us?

13:21.541 --> 13:25.845
I have no idea.
I tried to send out a mayday...

13:27.648 --> 13:31.787
- What should we do?
- Keep the fire going, like he said.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.386
And see what's in the packs
and stuff I threw out.

13:35.486 --> 13:37.325
I'll find more wood.

13:37.425 --> 13:40.463
Okay. But don't go too far.

13:40.563 --> 13:44.500
- We have no idea what's out there.
- Don't forget we have Chinook.

13:45.891 --> 13:49.774
Yeah. He looks like he'd be
pretty good in a fight.

14:06.324 --> 14:10.380
- I'm Jennifer Croft. Are you Mandisa?
- Yes, ma'am. Please take a seat.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.432
No, I can't sit. So what's the latest?

14:14.532 --> 14:16.634
As I told you on the phone,

14:16.734 --> 14:19.505
we think the plane went down
somewhere close to this area,

14:19.605 --> 14:22.076
based on the last radar coordinates.

14:22.176 --> 14:26.612
Okay, so what do we do? Has a helicopter
or a plane been sent out there?

14:26.712 --> 14:29.242
The civil defense authorities
will be here soon.

14:29.342 --> 14:32.332
They'll take over the search operation.

14:32.487 --> 14:33.855
Oh, my God.

14:34.044 --> 14:36.456
Did you manage to speak to your husband?

14:36.556 --> 14:39.511
Yes, he was getting on the plane
to head down here.

14:43.097 --> 14:46.168
- More cans.
- What's in that one?

14:46.968 --> 14:50.572
- Cave-i-ar.
- I think it's caviar.

14:57.612 --> 15:00.032
That's gross, it smells!

15:00.132 --> 15:02.269
Here, Chinook, you eat it.

15:07.623 --> 15:12.378
- Well, at least he likes it.
- Yeah. He can have it all.

15:14.135 --> 15:16.973
Now here's something I can eat...

15:19.169 --> 15:20.905
beans.

15:21.205 --> 15:23.641
I hope you have a can opener.

15:24.241 --> 15:26.479
It's not that hard to get into a tin can.

15:26.579 --> 15:29.334
Okay, so what else do we have?
Is there anymore water?

15:30.414 --> 15:34.304
Well, I guess we have
whatever we put in the packs.

15:34.954 --> 15:39.892
That's okay. There should be a stream
near here or it will rain soon.

15:41.292 --> 15:44.599
Yeah. We won't be here long.
They're coming for us.

15:45.499 --> 15:49.268
I hope so.
How will they know where to find us?

15:49.968 --> 15:54.009
They use computers and satellites
and stuff to find lost planes these days.

15:54.109 --> 15:56.178
I've seen it on TV.

15:56.278 --> 15:58.815
I think we should give Mr. Kruger some water.

15:58.915 --> 16:00.949
Yeah, I'll do it.

16:14.230 --> 16:16.667
He's hurt so badly, Ryan.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.967
I don't know much about first aid, you know.

16:19.067 --> 16:23.308
Well, I know we have to get
these wounds cleaned and bandaged.

16:23.408 --> 16:25.877
Otherwise, he's going to get an infection.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.550
We need a clean cloth or something like that.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.426
All I have is this spare T-shirt.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.017
That'll work.

16:43.647 --> 16:47.485
You tear it up into strips
and I'll wash out this wound.

16:52.771 --> 16:54.640
Okay, here we go.

17:15.597 --> 17:17.681
Help me lift his head.

17:38.255 --> 17:42.007
It looks really good.
You know, you could be a nurse.

17:42.107 --> 17:46.599
Well, I hope it works. It seems to
have stopped the bleeding at least.

18:08.971 --> 18:10.975
Colonel Ibori, welcome.

18:11.075 --> 18:13.393
This is Jennifer Croft,
the mother of the two children.

18:13.493 --> 18:17.432
Yes, Mrs. Croft. So sorry to be
meeting under these circumstances.

18:17.532 --> 18:19.534
Please be assured the Civil Defense Authority

18:19.634 --> 18:21.870
is conducting a complete search of the area.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.905
That's wonderful news.
Thank you, Colonel Ibori.

18:24.005 --> 18:26.843
How long before you think you find the plane?

18:26.943 --> 18:30.814
Mrs. Croft. We're not receiving
a signal from the ELT.

18:30.914 --> 18:34.851
- The ELT, what is that?
- It's the Emergency Locator Transmitter.

18:34.951 --> 18:39.642
It sends out a signal upon impact so we
can locate a downed plane by satellite.

18:40.022 --> 18:42.191
Okay, so why are we not getting a signal?

18:42.291 --> 18:46.496
Well, when an ELT is destroyed
or burnt up on impact,

18:46.596 --> 18:49.233
then there's no signal.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.855
Oh, my God.

19:15.929 --> 19:19.274
- I got here as quick as I could.
- Mr. Croft...

19:19.974 --> 19:22.669
I'm Colonel Ibori
of the Civil Defense Authority.

19:22.769 --> 19:26.525
We've set up camp about 3 miles from here.
Please come with me and I'll brief you.

19:27.210 --> 19:30.047
- Please.
- All right. Thank you.

19:33.915 --> 19:35.751
I'm so scared.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.457
What if a lion comes tonight?

19:43.024 --> 19:46.428
Mr. Kruger said the fire
would keep them away.

19:46.528 --> 19:47.964
What are you doing?

19:48.064 --> 19:51.635
Making a torch,
just like they do in the movies.

19:52.235 --> 19:54.170
We might need it.

19:54.270 --> 19:56.607
Thought you said they'd be here by now.

19:56.707 --> 19:59.474
Well, I'm sure they'll be here
in the morning.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.915
What was that?

20:05.015 --> 20:07.937
Lions. Ryan, lions.

20:08.487 --> 20:11.326
Quick, the torch. Yours is there. Light it!

20:20.766 --> 20:23.170
It's coming, Ryan, it's coming.

20:26.172 --> 20:28.042
It's over there!

20:41.122 --> 20:43.192
It's a tortoise.

20:46.228 --> 20:49.265
Oh, my gosh. I was so scared.

20:50.065 --> 20:52.501
It's kind of cool-looking, anyways.

20:52.851 --> 20:54.921
It is kind of cute.

21:04.981 --> 21:09.158
If that tortoise is all we're going to have
to deal with tonight, I will be very happy.

21:10.587 --> 21:13.258
I can't spend another hour out here.

21:13.858 --> 21:15.914
Let alone the entire night.

21:16.394 --> 21:19.030
Search plane should see our fire any moment.

21:19.130 --> 21:21.132
I'm so scared.

21:26.571 --> 21:29.540
Colonel Ibori, our children
can't spend the night out there.

21:29.640 --> 21:32.911
- We've got to find them, right away!
- Calm down, Mrs. Croft.

21:33.011 --> 21:37.050
Search and Rescue work at night is
dangerous. From the air and the ground.

21:37.150 --> 21:38.736
So we're just going to sit around here?

21:38.836 --> 21:42.990
Mr. Croft. Roger Kruger is an expert
on surviving in the bush.

21:43.090 --> 21:47.292
- The children are in good hands with him.
- And that's provided he survived the...

21:48.362 --> 21:51.621
At dawn, we have a huge number
of aircraft and ground personnel

21:51.721 --> 21:53.802
searching the entire area.

21:53.902 --> 21:56.404
Okay. Great. Well...

21:56.504 --> 21:58.809
let's just hope we find them in the morning.

21:59.609 --> 22:03.913
Jennifer, Robin Wade's dog,
Chinook, was on that plane.

22:04.613 --> 22:06.135
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

22:06.235 --> 22:11.270
Well, Robert says he's a big dog.
He's very protective of children.

22:11.370 --> 22:14.738
Mrs. Croft, if the children have a big dog
with them that's a good thing.

22:14.838 --> 22:17.625
Many of our local tribes
use dogs for protection.

22:17.725 --> 22:22.098
They protect livestock, people,
they're even used for hunting lions.

22:22.198 --> 22:24.952
And food, water? What if they're hurt?

22:25.052 --> 22:27.538
It's a supply plane for the mine, Mrs. Croft.

22:27.638 --> 22:31.577
It should have enough supplies
on it to last until we find them.

23:07.249 --> 23:10.336
Mr. Kruger. Mr. Kruger.

23:11.437 --> 23:15.508
Emma, wake up. Emma! Emma!

23:18.043 --> 23:20.321
Mr. Kruger, he won't wake up.

23:21.331 --> 23:23.333
Did you give him some water?

23:23.433 --> 23:25.468
Yeah, okay.

23:33.862 --> 23:35.990
Not too much.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.113
Mr. Kruger.

23:38.638 --> 23:40.810
Mr. Kruger!

23:40.910 --> 23:43.154
He's hurt real bad, Emma.

23:43.254 --> 23:46.658
I tried my best to help him.
He needs to be in a hospital.

23:47.058 --> 23:48.999
I know, Emma. I know.

23:49.099 --> 23:51.597
You did a great job fixing his head wound.

23:51.697 --> 23:55.253
What are going to do? He could die.

23:55.353 --> 23:59.238
You know what? We're not that
far away from the giant mine.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.875
I could hike there.

24:02.625 --> 24:06.296
- I don't know, Ryan.
- We've got to find help right away.

24:06.396 --> 24:09.344
I bet I could be there in a couple of hours.

24:09.444 --> 24:11.519
I'm not staying here by myself.

24:11.619 --> 24:13.822
Well, then we'll go together.

24:13.922 --> 24:16.392
We won't be long anyways.

24:16.492 --> 24:20.346
We'll leave a bottle of water
for Mr. Kruger in case he wakes up.

24:20.829 --> 24:24.734
Okay. As long as you're sure
we're not that far from the mine.

24:24.834 --> 24:29.242
We can't be. We flew for so long.
It has to be just up ahead.

24:29.972 --> 24:32.075
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:32.175 --> 24:34.743
Mum and Dad must be worried sick about us.

24:34.843 --> 24:38.515
Well, we'll get to the mine
and they'll tell them we're okay.

24:38.615 --> 24:41.454
- It shouldn't be that far away.
- Okay.

24:41.554 --> 24:43.788
As long as you're sure.

24:55.199 --> 24:58.702
- Come on, Chinook. Come on.
- Come on.

25:06.145 --> 25:09.120
- Mr. and Mrs. Croft, good morning.
- Morning. Colonel, do you have any news?

25:09.220 --> 25:14.187
We have launched 15 different aircraft to
search the area, helicopters and airplanes.

25:14.287 --> 25:16.044
Well, that's great news.

25:16.144 --> 25:19.561
Robert Wade is putting all the resources
of the mine into the search.

25:19.661 --> 25:23.998
We also have a number of teams
searching on the ground in vehicles.

25:24.098 --> 25:26.100
Yeah, if only we had an ELT signal.

25:26.200 --> 25:29.160
Yes, Mr. Croft, that would be
wonderful, but we don't,

25:29.260 --> 25:32.307
so there's no point
in concerning ourselves with it.

25:32.807 --> 25:35.711
Emma and Ryan must be
scared to death right now.

25:36.311 --> 25:38.414
We're going to find them.

25:38.514 --> 25:41.176
You and I both know how smart they are.

25:42.886 --> 25:44.921
I'm just so scared.

25:45.021 --> 25:47.792
I can't stand the thought
of losing both our children.

25:47.892 --> 25:49.784
I know.

26:01.640 --> 26:05.009
- This way.
- Chinook, let's go, come on.

26:14.653 --> 26:17.071
Oh, my gosh, Ryan, it's so hot.

26:17.171 --> 26:20.079
- I'm boiling.
- Yeah, I know. Let's take a little drink.

26:24.232 --> 26:26.733
Not too much! Not too much!

26:27.133 --> 26:31.373
- I hardly had any.
- Well, it has to last. Give me some.

26:35.943 --> 26:37.778
What are you doing?

26:37.878 --> 26:40.516
I'm keeping it. I don't trust you.

26:40.616 --> 26:42.217
What about Chinook?

26:42.317 --> 26:45.888
Well... you said the mine
can't be that much further,

26:45.988 --> 26:49.190
he'll be okay 'til we get there. Right?

26:49.290 --> 26:53.380
- I'm sure it isn't. Come on.
- Wait. Do you hear that?

26:54.596 --> 26:57.233
- Hear what?
- Listen.

27:02.506 --> 27:05.190
- Where is he going?
- Chinook, wait!

27:09.208 --> 27:11.434
Hey, it's an elephant!

27:22.561 --> 27:24.597
We have to help him.

27:25.097 --> 27:27.466
Yeah, come on.

28:01.286 --> 28:03.082
Here he comes.

28:14.283 --> 28:17.821
- He sure is cute.
- And very friendly.

28:18.421 --> 28:20.090
What shall we name him?

28:20.190 --> 28:22.893
Name him? He's not our pet.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.494
He thinks he is.

28:24.594 --> 28:28.633
Oh, my goodness,
first a dog, now an elephant.

28:28.733 --> 28:31.304
What will travel with us next, a baboon?

28:31.404 --> 28:33.995
Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

28:34.406 --> 28:38.461
- I'm so thirsty, I'm dying here.
- Okay, just a bit.

28:41.849 --> 28:45.685
He must be so thirsty.
Who knows when he drank last?

28:45.785 --> 28:48.523
We're not giving him our last drop of water.

28:49.623 --> 28:52.511
The mine can't be far.
It should be just over that hill.

28:52.611 --> 28:54.346
I hope you're right.

28:54.446 --> 28:58.432
Besides we still have to name him.
I think we should call him Rumba.

28:58.532 --> 29:01.803
Rumba? Where did that come from?

29:02.403 --> 29:05.759
I don't know.
It just popped in my head. Weird.

29:05.859 --> 29:09.445
Maybe it's 'cause one of my friends
back home dances the Rhumba.

29:09.545 --> 29:13.517
All right, then Rumba. It's actually
a pretty good elephant's name.

29:13.617 --> 29:15.469
But it doesn't mean we're keeping him.

29:19.322 --> 29:22.259
I know. I know. I just wish he was ours.

29:24.595 --> 29:28.497
Well, he lives in the African wild,
this is his home.

29:28.597 --> 29:32.170
- Okay. Bye, Rumba.
- Bye.

29:54.894 --> 29:58.164
Ryan, it looks like Rumba's following us.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.579
Oh, boy...

30:00.679 --> 30:03.904
this is just like why they say
never let a stray cat in.

30:04.454 --> 30:09.060
Well, he thinks we're his new family.
What should we do?

30:10.110 --> 30:11.725
I don't know.

30:13.580 --> 30:17.520
Emma, look at this.
Looks like some sort of trail.

30:17.620 --> 30:20.422
We must be getting close
to a village now or something.

30:20.522 --> 30:22.290
Let's follow it.

30:22.390 --> 30:25.527
We still have to find Chinook.
Where did he go?

30:25.627 --> 30:27.489
Chinook!

30:28.336 --> 30:30.153
Chinook!

31:15.632 --> 31:17.304
Attaboy.

32:02.743 --> 32:04.796
Come on, Chinook.

32:17.115 --> 32:19.752
Well, this looks like a good place to camp.

32:19.852 --> 32:21.488
What?

32:22.388 --> 32:24.666
I'm starving.
We should get a fire going and eat.

32:24.766 --> 32:29.250
Camp? What do you mean camp?
I thought you said the mine was close by.

32:29.564 --> 32:33.901
Well, maybe we'll have to spend
another night out here.

32:34.501 --> 32:38.406
What? No way. No way. The lions
will get us. What about Mr. Kruger?

32:39.106 --> 32:41.076
Maybe they found him by now.

32:41.176 --> 32:44.747
What? If they did
they would have found us too.

32:44.847 --> 32:48.028
I can't believe I ever let you
talk me into leaving the plane.

32:50.151 --> 32:52.222
Well, I don't know.

32:52.322 --> 32:55.005
It made perfect sense
that the mine was close by.

32:59.195 --> 33:03.334
That's it. I'm making the decisions
from now on. You're fired.

33:03.434 --> 33:06.516
- Yeah, right.
- Seriously.

33:07.116 --> 33:09.474
I can't spend another night out here.

33:09.574 --> 33:11.176
Well, it's not my fault.

33:11.276 --> 33:15.314
I thought we would either have been
found by now or found the mine.

33:16.314 --> 33:19.552
Now things are worse, Ryan, way worse.

33:53.621 --> 33:55.256
What are you doing?

33:55.356 --> 33:57.937
Trying to get a fire started.
What's it look like?

34:02.566 --> 34:05.435
Do you still have that bug kit Dad gave you?

34:05.535 --> 34:08.371
- Yeah. Why?
- Can I see it?

34:54.288 --> 34:57.724
Look, fire. The sticks, get the sticks.

34:57.824 --> 35:00.025
I don't believe this.

35:00.669 --> 35:02.958
We need to get bigger pieces.

35:08.235 --> 35:13.178
There's one thing that we will never run
out of around here. Which is dry wood.

35:13.543 --> 35:15.613
Time for some beans.

35:18.346 --> 35:22.052
I hope you brought a pot.
And how are you going to open that?

35:22.152 --> 35:25.155
Easy... just smash it on a rock.

35:38.168 --> 35:40.877
That's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

35:41.407 --> 35:44.944
Yeah, yeah, very funny. Hilarious.

35:47.063 --> 35:48.778
Rumba's leaving.

35:48.878 --> 35:52.668
We can't keep him.
Maybe he's going back to his family.

35:53.118 --> 35:55.121
Rumba, don't go.

35:57.425 --> 35:59.627
Yeah, maybe. I just wish he could stay.

36:10.504 --> 36:14.943
- Anything?
- I am sorry, Mr. Croft, not a trace.

36:15.443 --> 36:18.814
How can that be? The plane can't just vanish.

36:18.914 --> 36:22.451
Mr. Croft, it's a huge wilderness out there.

36:22.551 --> 36:24.387
The vegetation is very thick in some areas.

36:24.487 --> 36:27.586
Our pilots could have flown over it
several times without noticing it.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.493
What about the ground searchers?

36:29.593 --> 36:32.968
We have teams out carefully searching
in a grid pattern, Mrs. Croft.

36:33.068 --> 36:36.929
Most of them have agreed
to camp out in the bush at night,

36:37.029 --> 36:38.802
at great personal risk.

36:38.902 --> 36:43.508
Pers... personal risk?
What do you mean personal risk? Lions?

36:44.108 --> 36:48.007
Yes, Mrs. Croft,
that is a concern, I'm afraid.

36:49.613 --> 36:52.383
Oh, my God, Paul, we might never find them.

36:52.483 --> 36:54.069
Hopefully, they've started a fire.

36:54.169 --> 36:57.870
Most wild animals will avoid contact
with humans if there's a fire.

36:57.970 --> 37:00.877
Our kids have only been camping with us
a few times. They're not survivalists.

37:00.977 --> 37:05.416
I appreciate that, Mrs. Croft.
We're doing the best we can.

37:05.916 --> 37:10.371
As I've said, Roger Kruger will know
what to do in a situation like this.

37:14.074 --> 37:16.477
Here, you do a couple.

37:16.577 --> 37:18.580
We might need them.

37:23.751 --> 37:26.521
I don't think there's a creepier place
to have to spend the night.

37:26.621 --> 37:28.858
Maybe nothing will come.

37:31.293 --> 37:33.911
Maybe the fire will keep the animals away.

37:35.414 --> 37:37.618
And we won't have to worry.

37:45.008 --> 37:47.043
Plus, we have Chinook.

37:52.883 --> 37:56.219
- Who wants to toast a marshmallow?
- Me.

37:56.619 --> 37:59.026
So what happened to super fishermen today?

37:59.126 --> 38:01.359
I thought you boys were supposed
to be bringing home dinner.

38:01.459 --> 38:03.261
Yeah, they just weren't biting.

38:05.061 --> 38:07.165
More like you just couldn't catch one.

38:07.265 --> 38:11.770
- Yeah, I'd like to see you try.
- Ryan, we'll try again tomorrow.

38:11.870 --> 38:15.910
I've got some great tips on the best place
for bass from the guy two RVs down.

38:16.010 --> 38:18.111
All right, as long as you boys
aren't out all day.

38:18.211 --> 38:21.081
This is supposed to be
a family vacation, remember?

38:21.181 --> 38:24.151
Maybe we should also get
the address of a good restaurant.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.955
Nice one, Emma.

38:29.355 --> 38:31.560
We'll see about that tomorrow.

38:36.914 --> 38:38.583
What was that?

38:39.133 --> 38:41.402
It could be another tortoise.

38:44.307 --> 38:46.374
What was that? Something's out there.

38:46.474 --> 38:48.944
Light the torches. Hurry.

38:53.817 --> 38:56.085
They're everywhere. What are they?

38:56.185 --> 38:57.969
Hyena!

39:00.973 --> 39:02.809
Get away.

39:16.785 --> 39:18.366
Emma, the bushes!

39:18.466 --> 39:20.980
Set the bushes on fire, it's our only chance.

39:42.135 --> 39:44.438
Ryan, we're in so much trouble.

39:45.370 --> 39:46.718
We're going to die out here.

39:47.118 --> 39:50.346
- We chased them off.
- They'll come back!

39:50.446 --> 39:53.515
And no one will ever know
what happened to us.

39:54.215 --> 39:56.118
They'll eat us.

39:57.873 --> 40:00.368
Please, don't cry, Emma.

40:01.358 --> 40:03.896
I'll stay up and keep the fire going.

40:06.396 --> 40:09.797
- And you can sleep for a while.
- Sleep?

40:10.397 --> 40:12.936
I don't think I'm ever going to sleep again.

40:13.036 --> 40:16.528
I'm going to have nightmares
for the rest of my life.

40:18.009 --> 40:21.446
- I guess we'll stay up together.
- I don't get it.

40:21.546 --> 40:25.784
You watch horror movies all the time
and you still manage to sleep.

40:25.884 --> 40:27.987
How do you do it?

40:28.087 --> 40:31.408
- Aren't you scared?
- Of course I am.

40:33.159 --> 40:36.162
I wish we were with Mom
and Dad right now too.

40:37.261 --> 40:38.923
But...

40:39.373 --> 40:43.088
they'd want us to keep it together.
Until we're found.

40:44.438 --> 40:46.307
We have to.

41:12.354 --> 41:13.996
Emma!

41:14.721 --> 41:18.590
- Emma, why did you run off on me?
- I didn't run off, I've been right here.

41:18.690 --> 41:21.461
It's dangerous. We need to stick together.

41:21.561 --> 41:24.414
- I had Chinook.
- What about me?

41:24.514 --> 41:27.849
Dear, Ryan Croft, soccer star,
can't look after himself.

41:28.919 --> 41:31.873
- I just about got eaten by a giant chicken.
- A giant chicken?

41:31.973 --> 41:35.543
Yes. A giant chicken walked
into the camp and pecked me.

41:35.693 --> 41:39.897
- You mean an ostrich, perhaps?
- Whatever. It was huge.

41:39.997 --> 41:43.703
We could have made two thousand chicken
fingers out of it. Now we need to keep going.

41:43.803 --> 41:47.675
- Go where?
- The mine. It's just over that ridge.

41:48.095 --> 41:50.877
No, not this again. I'm staying right here.

41:50.977 --> 41:55.386
We can't stay here, it's dangerous.
We don't know what's going to come tonight.

41:55.486 --> 41:58.686
And do you really want to go through
another night like last night?

41:58.786 --> 42:00.909
- No.
- Exactly.

42:01.009 --> 42:03.624
So let's fill the water bottle and go.

42:03.724 --> 42:08.931
Come on, Chinook, his highness
has spoken, we're leaving now.

42:43.901 --> 42:45.672
Oh, my gosh, it's hot.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.939
See, I told you we should
have stayed at the water hole.

42:48.139 --> 42:51.210
Be quiet! We've been through this.

43:10.331 --> 43:13.368
- Ryan, do you hear that?
- Hear what?

43:15.001 --> 43:16.836
Ryan, look.

43:17.738 --> 43:19.573
What is that?

43:22.042 --> 43:23.778
Run!

44:09.694 --> 44:11.428
Croft!

44:15.301 --> 44:19.039
- News, Colonel Ibori?
- Mr. and Mrs. Croft...

44:19.139 --> 44:22.476
I've received a radio message
from one of the outer villages.

44:22.976 --> 44:28.158
A hunting party of bushmen
have found the plane and the pilot.

44:28.258 --> 44:30.985
That's great news. And our children?

44:31.285 --> 44:34.588
I'm sorry to report
the children were not there.

44:34.688 --> 44:37.826
Not... what do you mean not there?
Where are they?

44:38.326 --> 44:41.582
At this stage, Mrs. Croft, we have no idea.

44:41.962 --> 44:46.425
The pilot is suffering from extreme
dehydration and heat stroke.

44:46.525 --> 44:50.107
- He doesn't know where the children are.
- So what do we do now?

44:50.207 --> 44:52.964
We continue to search until we find them.

44:55.144 --> 44:57.914
I am afraid I have some rather bad news.

44:58.014 --> 44:59.616
What?

45:01.284 --> 45:04.020
The plane was found...

45:05.924 --> 45:07.592
here.

45:08.072 --> 45:11.996
The pilot went off course by many miles
and went too close to the border.

45:12.096 --> 45:14.900
We have numerous reports
of rebel activity along the border.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.037
Okay. What does all this mean?

45:18.137 --> 45:21.522
Well, I can't order my helicopters
and ground crews close to that area,

45:21.622 --> 45:22.784
it's far too dangerous.

45:22.884 --> 45:25.511
So you're going to leave
our children out there?

45:25.611 --> 45:26.997
We might not have much time.

45:27.097 --> 45:31.885
Mrs. Croft, the children could have
wandered off in any direction.

45:32.185 --> 45:34.855
If they've gone across the border...

45:37.291 --> 45:40.460
Well, that's great. That's just great!

45:40.560 --> 45:42.023
Jennifer!

45:45.066 --> 45:46.301
Hey, Jennifer.

45:46.401 --> 45:48.836
We have to do something.
We've got to do something now.

45:48.936 --> 45:52.808
I know. I know. I just feel helpless.

45:53.892 --> 45:56.595
All right, what about Robert,
your boss, what is he doing?

45:56.695 --> 45:58.514
Yeah, I talked to him this morning,

45:58.614 --> 46:01.952
he said the company's doing
everything that they can on their end.

46:02.052 --> 46:03.520
What's that even mean?

46:03.620 --> 46:07.123
Well, mainly flying over
the possible crash zones.

46:07.223 --> 46:11.095
Now that we've found the wreckage,
that will narrow the search area.

46:11.195 --> 46:13.716
Okay, I'm sorry. I don't...

46:13.816 --> 46:17.396
I don't want to sound like I'm blaming you
or the company or anybody, I'm just...

46:17.496 --> 46:20.728
I'm so angry and frustrated and scared...

46:20.828 --> 46:24.472
So am I, Jen, so am I.

46:29.714 --> 46:32.684
What do we do now? Chinook is gone.

46:37.256 --> 46:38.555
Chinook!

46:44.364 --> 46:45.954
Chinook!

46:51.278 --> 46:54.109
- Chinook!
- Forget it.

46:55.276 --> 46:58.287
He was trampled and we didn't even help him.

47:00.248 --> 47:02.152
Come on, we can't just stay here.

47:04.720 --> 47:07.091
What are we going to do now, Ryan?

47:09.490 --> 47:12.730
We have to keep going
and get over that ridge.

47:48.034 --> 47:51.690
That's just great! Just great!

47:52.370 --> 47:54.708
What are we supposed to do now?

47:55.008 --> 47:57.530
I can't believe this! Like...

49:57.042 --> 49:59.978
I'm so tired, Ryan,
I can't go on anymore today.

50:00.078 --> 50:01.748
Yeah.

50:06.051 --> 50:08.655
Mom and Dad must be worried sick about us.

50:08.755 --> 50:11.523
How come we haven't seen a plane or anything?

50:11.623 --> 50:14.762
I don't know, I guess they must
be looking in the wrong spot.

50:14.862 --> 50:17.998
Poor Chinook. I can't believe he's gone.

50:18.598 --> 50:21.434
- Me neither.
- It's okay to cry, you know, Ryan.

50:21.534 --> 50:24.506
You don't have to be all boy out here,
none of your friends are around.

50:24.606 --> 50:26.173
Yeah, I know.

50:26.273 --> 50:28.843
I'm so hungry. We need a fire and some beans.

50:28.943 --> 50:31.278
Okay. I'll go find some wood.

50:39.689 --> 50:43.291
Yeah, wow, is right. Look at all the stars.

50:47.564 --> 50:50.334
That's what we've been missing as city kids.

50:51.902 --> 50:55.140
- You know, I have an idea.
- What?

50:55.940 --> 50:59.022
That's where we're going to
spend the night, the tree.

51:00.112 --> 51:01.945
Sleep up there?

51:02.045 --> 51:05.450
Yeah, well, it's safer
than being on the ground.

51:05.550 --> 51:07.653
Birds do it, why can't we?

51:07.753 --> 51:11.691
Yeah. That's the best idea you've had so far.

51:36.350 --> 51:39.687
- Hey, you can lie down.
- Okay, I'll try.

51:49.331 --> 51:51.901
- Comfy.
- Really?

51:52.001 --> 51:56.038
No, not at all. Do I ever miss my bed.

51:56.238 --> 51:58.720
I want to try sleeping like a cat.

52:04.214 --> 52:06.583
- Ryan?
- Yeah?

52:06.683 --> 52:08.919
Can lions climb trees?

52:10.119 --> 52:12.323
Well, I don't think so.

52:12.623 --> 52:14.826
That's reassuring.

52:15.226 --> 52:18.061
Well, I'm not an expert on Africa, you know.

52:24.470 --> 52:27.039
- Ryan.
- Yeah?

52:27.939 --> 52:31.244
- I have a visitor.
- Really? What?

52:31.977 --> 52:35.283
I don't know, but it's small, furry,

52:35.383 --> 52:37.784
and very funny looking.

52:39.184 --> 52:42.055
Cool. What is that?

52:42.355 --> 52:44.725
I don't know. A monkey of some sort?

52:44.825 --> 52:46.895
Yeah, that thing is cool.

52:46.995 --> 52:50.431
I bet we could make millions selling
those to kids back in the States.

52:50.531 --> 52:53.036
I think it's the cutest thing in the world.

52:54.936 --> 52:57.006
I hope it comes back.

52:57.106 --> 53:01.445
Good night. Don't let the furry
tree-dwelling animals bite.

53:05.680 --> 53:08.184
- Ryan?
- Yeah?

53:08.284 --> 53:11.219
Thanks for taking such good care
of me and being a good brother.

53:11.319 --> 53:13.343
You're welcome, Emma.

53:14.255 --> 53:16.528
It's going to be okay, all right?

53:17.527 --> 53:21.732
Yeah. I just have to keep
reminding myself that.

53:21.832 --> 53:23.594
It's hard though.

53:23.694 --> 53:26.616
I worry that they'll never find us...

53:27.374 --> 53:30.542
and Mom and Dad will never know
what happened to us.

53:30.642 --> 53:33.494
Yeah. I've thought of the same thing, Emma.

53:33.994 --> 53:36.139
It scares me.

53:36.239 --> 53:38.908
But somehow we just need
to keep believing that

53:39.008 --> 53:43.289
tomorrow will be the day
that they find us and we'll go home.

53:43.689 --> 53:47.493
Yeah, you're right, Ryan. I'll try.

54:03.072 --> 54:04.711
Ryan!

54:07.115 --> 54:09.517
Is your furry friend back?

54:10.617 --> 54:15.422
No, much bigger. Much, much bigger.

54:16.359 --> 54:19.229
- It's a giraffe.
- Really?

54:21.130 --> 54:23.134
That's so awesome.

54:25.434 --> 54:27.438
Emma, watch this.

54:45.489 --> 54:47.961
You see that? Do you see that?

54:48.061 --> 54:49.212
Yeah.

55:01.041 --> 55:04.747
You're like some sort of animal magnet.
They all love you.

55:13.453 --> 55:15.090
It's so cool.

55:18.559 --> 55:20.716
I wish Mom and Dad were here to see this.

55:20.816 --> 55:23.156
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

55:23.256 --> 55:25.535
You like that? Did you see that?

55:25.635 --> 55:26.937
Yeah.

55:35.513 --> 55:40.649
- Over there. Over there.
- Over here. Hey... hey, giraffe.

55:46.891 --> 55:49.321
No one will ever believe this.

56:06.578 --> 56:09.216
Man, we have to find some water soon.

56:09.916 --> 56:12.786
I've never appreciated water
more in my life than now.

56:14.086 --> 56:16.723
There has to be a stream
around here some place.

56:16.823 --> 56:18.792
Let's keep heading the way we've been going.

56:18.892 --> 56:22.094
That way we know that we
aren't walking in circles.

56:22.194 --> 56:25.066
- How do you know we haven't?
- Come on.

56:31.840 --> 56:33.481
Yeah.

56:34.005 --> 56:37.213
- Okay, thank you.
- What'd he say?

56:37.313 --> 56:40.783
He said there's very little the US government
can do. It's not their jurisdiction.

56:40.883 --> 56:44.555
He says the embassy will continue to monitor
the situation, whatever that means.

56:44.655 --> 56:48.156
Well, surely the US military can help
with extra helicopters or something.

56:48.256 --> 56:51.444
- Governments help each other all the time.
- He said the only way for that to happen

56:51.544 --> 56:54.806
is for the local government
to make a specific request.

56:55.233 --> 56:57.803
This is so frustrating. We're just helpless.

56:58.403 --> 57:01.706
I haven't given up, yet, Jen,
not by a long shot.

57:01.806 --> 57:05.673
- We have two very smart kids out there.
- We should have found them by now.

57:06.745 --> 57:09.115
We're running out of time, I know it.

57:15.120 --> 57:17.856
We need water, Emma, water.

57:17.956 --> 57:19.859
I just drank the last bit.

57:19.959 --> 57:22.382
You did? What about me?

57:23.362 --> 57:25.864
There was only a little tiny drop left.

57:26.164 --> 57:28.436
Well, you should have shared that with me.

57:28.536 --> 57:30.403
I'm sorry.

57:30.603 --> 57:32.860
So hot.

57:33.460 --> 57:35.256
We've gotta find water.

57:35.356 --> 57:38.147
There has to be some around here someplace.

57:38.247 --> 57:40.363
A water hole, at least.

58:42.082 --> 58:44.051
<i>Emma.</i>

58:44.451 --> 58:46.121
Mom?

58:46.521 --> 58:49.925
<i>Emma. Emma.</i>

58:50.725 --> 58:52.394
Mom?

01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:03.484
Check that out. Clear beautiful, rain water.

01:00:04.404 --> 01:00:08.043
I'm so glad you did that.
You're a good smart brother.

01:00:08.643 --> 01:00:11.447
- Thank you.
- We almost died, Ryan.

01:00:11.547 --> 01:00:15.685
But, you know what?
I was calm. I wasn't afraid.

01:00:17.587 --> 01:00:22.176
- Mom came to me.
- Mom? Mom was here?

01:00:23.026 --> 01:00:27.732
Yeah. Yeah, I saw her. She called out to me.

01:00:28.967 --> 01:00:31.002
Then the rain came.

01:00:31.102 --> 01:00:33.305
What are you talking about?

01:00:33.405 --> 01:00:35.432
I'm not sure...

01:00:36.368 --> 01:00:38.321
but I saw her.

01:00:39.343 --> 01:00:41.814
I think your brain's playing tricks on you.

01:00:42.214 --> 01:00:44.112
Yeah, maybe.

01:00:44.797 --> 01:00:46.607
Maybe not.

01:00:46.951 --> 01:00:48.753
Come on.

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:29.132
Ryan.

01:01:30.732 --> 01:01:32.902
What do we do?

01:01:35.438 --> 01:01:36.908
Come on.

01:02:42.478 --> 01:02:45.315
- I think it's gone.
- I'm not moving.

01:02:45.415 --> 01:02:49.185
- It's gone, Emma.
- Why'd it want to kill us? What did we do?

01:02:49.285 --> 01:02:53.454
I don't know.
This one was a lot meaner than Rumba.

01:02:59.631 --> 01:03:01.941
Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Croft.

01:03:02.041 --> 01:03:06.237
Colonel Ibori, my wife and I have been
talking, we just can't sit around any longer.

01:03:06.337 --> 01:03:08.674
We have to get involved in this search.

01:03:08.774 --> 01:03:10.662
I'm sorry, that's against regulations.

01:03:10.762 --> 01:03:14.912
We don't care about the rebels.
Okay, we'll take a jeep into the area.

01:03:15.012 --> 01:03:17.750
- I cannot allow that.
- All right, how about one of the choppers.

01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:20.854
- We can go up in one of the choppers.
- I'll give it some thought.

01:03:20.954 --> 01:03:25.357
- Typically I wouldn't allow such a thing.
- We can't stand around here doing nothing.

01:03:25.557 --> 01:03:29.680
Mrs. Croft... hunters from
several villages have agreed to assist

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.451
in the search for your children.
They often track game for days.

01:03:33.551 --> 01:03:36.550
Right. That's great news.
Thanks, we appreciate it.

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:42.010
Now we're going to attempt to reach out to
the rebels and explain the situation to them.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:46.836
They may agree to give my team
safe passage in the disputed zone,

01:03:46.936 --> 01:03:50.085
- given the circumstances.
- How long will that take?

01:03:50.185 --> 01:03:54.292
Mr. Croft, you don't just make a cell
phone call to a rebel commander,

01:03:54.392 --> 01:03:58.945
they're not easy people to reach,
but we will try our best.

01:04:03.767 --> 01:04:06.705
- Ryan, do you hear that?
- What?

01:04:06.905 --> 01:04:08.638
Listen.

01:04:10.976 --> 01:04:13.812
- Water! Come on.
- Emma.

01:04:44.279 --> 01:04:48.016
Oh, my gosh.
This is the best water I've ever tasted.

01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:51.630
I'll get the water bottle.

01:05:31.064 --> 01:05:32.251
Check it out.

01:05:38.303 --> 01:05:39.773
Amazing.

01:05:39.973 --> 01:05:42.213
Now we have one big problem.

01:05:42.843 --> 01:05:44.499
Getting across?

01:05:44.599 --> 01:05:47.181
- Yeah.
- Let's walk along the bank a bit.

01:05:47.281 --> 01:05:48.882
Okay.

01:06:48.212 --> 01:06:50.321
Well, this is how we get across.

01:06:51.251 --> 01:06:53.491
But it's so old...

01:06:53.591 --> 01:06:56.189
and there's boards missing and stuff.

01:06:56.289 --> 01:07:00.204
Well, if we go one at a time to keep
the weight down, I bet we'd be okay.

01:07:00.304 --> 01:07:03.695
- I'll go first.
- No, I'm the lightest, I'll go first.

01:07:03.795 --> 01:07:07.509
Okay. Just hold onto the ropes at all times.

01:07:07.802 --> 01:07:09.846
You should be fine.

01:07:26.688 --> 01:07:28.692
You're looking good.

01:07:43.307 --> 01:07:45.310
It's working fine.

01:07:53.385 --> 01:07:56.930
- I did it!
- I knew it would be okay.

01:07:57.030 --> 01:07:58.857
Here I come.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.736
Slowly, Ryan.

01:08:18.145 --> 01:08:20.383
Maybe you should go back.

01:08:30.341 --> 01:08:32.611
- Ryan!
- Don't come out here.

01:08:32.711 --> 01:08:34.947
Try and pull yourself up.

01:08:44.456 --> 01:08:46.091
Ryan!

01:08:48.546 --> 01:08:50.615
Ryan, below you!

01:08:53.183 --> 01:08:56.107
- Get out of here.
- Ryan! Ryan!

01:08:58.005 --> 01:08:59.649
Help!

01:09:09.768 --> 01:09:12.904
Chinook. Ryan, you won't believe this.

01:09:15.241 --> 01:09:17.510
Chinook. Help me, Chinook.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:38.665
- I was so scared.
- Yeah, so was I.

01:09:38.765 --> 01:09:41.403
I can't believe Chinook's here. He saved you.

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:43.638
Thank you, boy.

01:09:43.938 --> 01:09:46.242
The mine's just over the next hill, right?

01:09:46.542 --> 01:09:48.076
Yeah.

01:10:01.258 --> 01:10:06.108
Once we get to the mine I'm never having
another bean for the rest of my life.

01:10:06.465 --> 01:10:10.133
- Me neither.
- So much has happened to us.

01:10:10.233 --> 01:10:12.904
Yeah, I know.

01:10:13.675 --> 01:10:17.117
Africa has tried to kill us like fifty times.

01:10:17.417 --> 01:10:19.511
We're still going.

01:10:19.811 --> 01:10:21.680
Yeah, thanks to Chinook here.

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:24.883
Mom and Dad would be so proud of us
if they knew what we've been through.

01:10:24.983 --> 01:10:27.187
I miss them so much.

01:10:27.705 --> 01:10:31.424
- Mom must be freaking out.
- Yeah, me too.

01:10:32.024 --> 01:10:34.328
What, you miss Mom or you're freaking out?

01:10:34.428 --> 01:10:38.233
- I miss Mom.
- Chinook's owners must be worried about him.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.369
What was that?

01:10:41.102 --> 01:10:44.065
- I don't know.
- Lions.

01:10:44.165 --> 01:10:46.273
Lions. They found us, Ryan.

01:10:46.373 --> 01:10:48.243
The torches!

01:10:57.285 --> 01:10:59.690
Where are they, I can't tell.

01:11:00.591 --> 01:11:03.760
- Maybe the fire shall protect us.
- I'm so scared.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.629
Lion!

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:15.211
What are you doing?

01:11:34.826 --> 01:11:37.029
Make that fifty-one times.

01:11:37.429 --> 01:11:40.066
I want Mom, I want Mom. I want Mom.

01:11:40.266 --> 01:11:44.307
They didn't get us. They're scared
of the fire just like the hyenas.

01:11:44.407 --> 01:11:48.742
Now, look, we need to make more
torches now before they come back.

01:11:48.842 --> 01:11:50.978
Maybe we should make another fire.

01:11:51.078 --> 01:11:52.915
Good idea.

01:12:46.672 --> 01:12:50.347
- What are you supposed to be?
- I'm a warrior now.

01:12:50.447 --> 01:12:53.813
If that lion wants to kill us, he's
going to have to go through me first.

01:12:53.913 --> 01:12:57.753
Okay. I swear I'll never understand boys.

01:13:00.753 --> 01:13:03.823
- It's him.
- Get ready.

01:13:04.725 --> 01:13:06.594
He's coming.

01:13:08.847 --> 01:13:11.661
You want us! Come and get us!

01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:14.640
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to pick a fight with him.

01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:18.974
- Are you crazy?
- You stupid coward!

01:13:19.575 --> 01:13:22.079
Great, now you got him doing it.

01:13:24.248 --> 01:13:25.983
Get away!

01:13:27.232 --> 01:13:29.069
Give me yours.

01:13:31.987 --> 01:13:33.795
Leave!

01:13:34.086 --> 01:13:35.542
Get away!

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:37.828
Leave!

01:13:43.702 --> 01:13:46.304
Yeah, that's right, Mr. Lion.

01:13:46.404 --> 01:13:48.077
You better run.

01:13:49.208 --> 01:13:50.777
Ryan.

01:13:50.877 --> 01:13:54.181
We scared him away. He's not coming back.

01:13:54.481 --> 01:13:56.817
He could come back any time.

01:13:58.317 --> 01:13:59.589
And we will be ready.

01:13:59.689 --> 01:14:02.454
Okay, you can drop the whole Rambo act, okay?

01:14:02.554 --> 01:14:05.091
And wipe that stuff off your face.

01:14:05.891 --> 01:14:07.927
Yeah, okay.

01:14:09.563 --> 01:14:12.377
I don't think we're going
to be able to sleep tonight.

01:15:04.456 --> 01:15:06.362
What is it, boy?

01:15:08.694 --> 01:15:11.698
Ryan, wake up. Ryan.

01:15:16.402 --> 01:15:17.637
What a night, man.

01:15:17.737 --> 01:15:20.273
I feel like I could sleep
for another 10 hours.

01:15:20.373 --> 01:15:23.444
Well, we can't. We need to keep moving.

01:15:24.844 --> 01:15:28.546
- I'm not sticking around here much longer.
- Yeah, me neither.

01:15:28.646 --> 01:15:32.454
Hey, at least Chinook can take
a shift as a watchdog for us.

01:15:36.792 --> 01:15:39.411
Come on, boy. Come on.

01:15:39.511 --> 01:15:42.377
Come on. Come on. Come on, boy.

01:15:42.477 --> 01:15:45.469
- Chinook, come on. Come on.
- Come on. That a boy.

01:16:00.517 --> 01:16:03.587
- You have news, Colonel?
- Yes, Mr. Croft.

01:16:03.687 --> 01:16:07.625
Earlier today a group of bushmen
found the remains of a camp fire.

01:16:08.325 --> 01:16:12.069
- And you think it was made by our kids?
- We're quite sure it was.

01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:14.933
There was a shoe print by the fire
clearly made by a running shoe,

01:16:15.233 --> 01:16:17.502
worn by a boy about your son's age.

01:16:17.602 --> 01:16:20.973
That's... that's great. They're alive.

01:16:22.407 --> 01:16:24.944
Okay, so where was this camp fire found?

01:16:25.044 --> 01:16:27.514
Right there. About ten miles
from the crash site.

01:16:27.614 --> 01:16:30.116
Ten miles, how could they walk so far?

01:16:30.416 --> 01:16:32.752
We are going to focus our search here.

01:16:32.852 --> 01:16:34.862
Hopefully they kept heading
in the same direction.

01:16:34.962 --> 01:16:38.124
This is the best news we've had.
Can we please join the search now?

01:16:38.224 --> 01:16:40.561
Yes, Mrs. Croft, that'll be fine.

01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:43.664
The good news is they're
moving away from the border.

01:16:59.749 --> 01:17:02.418
Come on, boy, come on.

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.589
Hey! Look at that!

01:17:20.404 --> 01:17:22.841
No, the poor thing.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.044
- What day is this?
- Good question. Friday?

01:17:57.144 --> 01:18:00.214
Gosh, it seems like
we've been out here forever.

01:18:00.314 --> 01:18:02.684
The mine just has to be close by now.

01:18:02.784 --> 01:18:05.055
We've been walking for days.

01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:06.979
Yeah.

01:18:07.655 --> 01:18:10.460
How do we know it's been in a straight line?

01:18:13.963 --> 01:18:18.067
I wonder if we'll ever get there
or we'll just die out here.

01:18:18.167 --> 01:18:21.873
Don't say that.
We survived everything so far.

01:18:23.273 --> 01:18:25.323
I'm getting weaker, Ryan.

01:18:25.423 --> 01:18:28.812
I'm so hungry, so tired,
I could just lie down right here.

01:18:28.912 --> 01:18:31.215
We'll get back to Mom and Dad,

01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:33.851
a plane or helicopter will see us soon.

01:18:34.951 --> 01:18:38.189
I hope you're right.
I can't last much longer.

01:18:38.289 --> 01:18:40.358
Yeah, I know.

01:19:48.365 --> 01:19:50.045
We'll be ready when that lion comes back.

01:19:50.145 --> 01:19:54.271
We're not going to have any of
the macho warrior stuff again, are we?

01:19:54.371 --> 01:19:55.540
Maybe.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.244
Give me a break.
You think girls like that kind of stuff?

01:19:58.344 --> 01:20:01.247
Well, back home they do.

01:20:01.347 --> 01:20:03.250
Yeah, who?

01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:06.954
All your friends. They totally
gawk at me when they come over.

01:20:09.154 --> 01:20:12.194
In your dreams, macho man.

01:20:24.170 --> 01:20:26.615
Hey, why did you do that?

01:20:26.715 --> 01:20:28.411
Do what?

01:20:28.511 --> 01:20:30.513
Hit me with this.

01:20:32.416 --> 01:20:35.918
- I didn't throw anything.
- Yeah, right.

01:20:38.954 --> 01:20:40.590
Hey!

01:20:43.243 --> 01:20:45.079
Ryan, look.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:52.645
It's a monkey. Maybe he thinks
you're a long lost relative.

01:20:57.541 --> 01:20:59.678
It's okay, Chinook.

01:21:01.647 --> 01:21:05.652
- Maybe we're trespassing, Ryan.
- Well, I'm not moving.

01:21:28.943 --> 01:21:31.580
Emma, you should get some sleep.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:33.882
I'll sit up.

01:21:33.982 --> 01:21:35.999
Chinook is a pretty good watch dog.

01:21:36.853 --> 01:21:40.721
- I don't know. After last night...
- Don't worry. We'll be okay.

01:21:40.821 --> 01:21:42.858
Okay, I'll try.

01:22:25.038 --> 01:22:27.240
Emma. Emma.

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.546
- Is the lion back?
- I think so. Get a torch.

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:45.159
Get away!

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:56.558
He's not gone. He's not gone, I know it.

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:07.331
My torch is out!

01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:23.303
- We can't keep this up all night.
- We will if we have to.

01:23:23.403 --> 01:23:25.471
I want to get out of here.

01:23:25.571 --> 01:23:27.973
Me too. Me too.

01:23:47.194 --> 01:23:49.196
Emma, what's wrong?

01:23:49.296 --> 01:23:51.333
We're still here.

01:23:52.033 --> 01:23:55.804
I just keep hoping that this is
a nightmare I'll wake up from.

01:23:56.204 --> 01:23:59.774
I'm sorry, Emma. It's all my fault.

01:23:59.874 --> 01:24:02.510
I just kept thinking
the mine was so close by.

01:24:02.610 --> 01:24:04.645
We could be anywhere.

01:24:04.745 --> 01:24:08.750
Well, I think we've been walking
in a pretty straight line.

01:24:13.022 --> 01:24:14.791
That's all we have left.

01:24:14.891 --> 01:24:18.794
- A sip for me and a sip for you.
- We better find more water today.

01:24:18.894 --> 01:24:22.567
- We will.
- Better yet, that stupid mine.

01:24:22.667 --> 01:24:25.168
That lion could be around here anywhere.

01:24:25.268 --> 01:24:27.272
Let's move out.

01:24:32.377 --> 01:24:34.980
It is so, so hot...

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.917
Just try not to think about it.

01:24:37.717 --> 01:24:41.253
Come on, Chinook. Come on, boy.

01:25:08.852 --> 01:25:10.454
Run!

01:25:35.614 --> 01:25:37.283
Water.

01:25:43.521 --> 01:25:45.525
Ryan, look out!

01:25:49.924 --> 01:25:53.184
- Ryan, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

01:25:53.763 --> 01:25:56.187
We can't go up and we can't go down.

01:25:56.803 --> 01:26:00.974
- The lion's still out there.
- We could send Chinook for help.

01:26:01.074 --> 01:26:03.144
Give me a break, Emma.

01:26:03.244 --> 01:26:04.877
Did you hear that?

01:26:04.977 --> 01:26:07.555
Yeah, sounds like another big elephant.
Just what we need.

01:26:08.415 --> 01:26:10.483
Ryan, it's Rumba.

01:26:11.853 --> 01:26:14.323
Rumba, come here. Come here, Rumba.

01:26:14.423 --> 01:26:16.463
Attaboy, Rumba.

01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:21.291
Come on, Rumba.

01:26:24.548 --> 01:26:26.594
Thank you, Rumba. Help her.

01:26:26.694 --> 01:26:29.211
Come on. Come here, Rumba.

01:26:34.845 --> 01:26:36.132
Thank you.

01:26:36.235 --> 01:26:39.748
Thank you, Rumba. Thank you.

01:26:44.722 --> 01:26:46.598
Bye, Rumba.

01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:50.996
- I'll never forget you.
- You saved us, Rumba.

01:27:24.132 --> 01:27:27.183
- Ryan, do you hear that?
- Yeah.

01:27:27.283 --> 01:27:30.170
A jeep. Come on!

01:27:38.847 --> 01:27:40.916
Stop! Stop!

01:28:03.874 --> 01:28:06.445
Mr. Kruger. We need to find him.
We left him, Dad.

01:28:06.545 --> 01:28:09.416
No, it's okay, son. He's been found.
And he's recovering just fine.

01:28:09.516 --> 01:28:12.110
Oh, God, Emma, Ryan, are either
of you hurt? Are you okay?

01:28:12.210 --> 01:28:14.254
- I'm fine, Mom.
- I'm okay too, Mom.

01:28:14.454 --> 01:28:17.331
You know, we've been searching
for days for you two.

01:28:17.431 --> 01:28:19.659
How'd you end up all the way out here?

01:28:19.759 --> 01:28:24.596
We thought your mine was close by
and we really needed to help Mr. Kruger.

01:28:24.696 --> 01:28:27.300
So we just started walking
and then we got lost.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:30.004
We saved an elephant and then he saved us.

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:32.373
An elephant saved you?

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:35.541
Yeah, Dad. And we got chased by a lion.

01:28:35.641 --> 01:28:39.047
- And a hyena almost ate us.
- How did you survive?

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:43.018
- We built fires.
- Yeah, and Chinook helped us a lot.

01:28:43.118 --> 01:28:46.455
But then he got lost for a while
after the zebra stampede.

01:28:46.555 --> 01:28:49.158
Zebra stampede. Paul...

01:28:49.784 --> 01:28:52.129
You guys are going to have
to write this all down in a book.

01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:55.496
- Maybe they'll make a movie about us.
- Yeah, right, Ryan.

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:57.433
Right now I just want to
get you two home safely.

01:28:57.533 --> 01:28:59.293
Come on, you.

01:28:59.503 --> 01:29:04.108
And Ryan got pecked by an ostrich.
And a monkey threw fruit at his head.

01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:06.827
- I don't believe that.
- It really did happen, Dad.

01:29:06.927 --> 01:29:09.280
Okay, you can tell us all about it
in the jeep. All right?

01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:12.082
I just want to get you two home,
safe and sound.
