<i>MADISON: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...</i>

00:04.110 --> 00:06.044
Why are you insisting on
going to summer school?

00:06.078 --> 00:07.078
Your mother wants me to go so
I'll be there when Ethan is there.

00:07.113 --> 00:08.413
Why do you even care if
I go to summer school?

00:08.447 --> 00:10.348
What are you doing here? I'm moving in!

00:10.383 --> 00:12.350
I thought your mom said
you couldn't move in.

00:12.385 --> 00:14.186
Yes. She did. She said
I had to go to med camp.

00:14.220 --> 00:15.253
I couldn't go to summer school.

00:15.288 --> 00:17.222
And, how's she going
to find out about it?

00:17.256 --> 00:19.057
She left for Africa this morning.

00:19.091 --> 00:20.392
Get up, you're going to summer school.

00:20.426 --> 00:22.260
That's going to be my punishment now?

00:22.295 --> 00:24.396
You go out there and you find
yourself another boyfriend.

00:24.430 --> 00:27.065
Mom, you totally got the
wrong impression of Ben.

00:27.099 --> 00:28.500
Thanks again for letting me
walk into school with you.

00:28.534 --> 00:31.169
It makes the first day of high
school a little less awkward for me.

00:31.204 --> 00:32.170
You're the person looking
out after him at school

00:32.205 --> 00:33.338
and keeping him out of trouble.

00:33.372 --> 00:37.242
Amy used to be my best
friend. So did Lauren.

00:37.276 --> 00:39.177
Did you do something they
won't forgive you for?

00:39.212 --> 00:40.245
I just wanted to apologize.

00:40.279 --> 00:41.446
You knew what you were doing.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.448
I'm not so upset with
you as I am with Henry.

00:43.482 --> 00:45.450
Would you consider going out with me?

00:45.484 --> 00:47.319
No, I can't.

00:47.353 --> 00:48.453
It was their pot. They brought it over.

00:48.487 --> 00:51.256
This girl is not the
girl for you, Benjamin.

00:52.391 --> 00:54.192
You let Ethan in the apartment alone

00:54.227 --> 00:56.261
after everything he did at school today?

00:56.295 --> 00:57.429
See, I did learn a little
something at summer school.

00:57.463 --> 00:59.364
(CHUCKLES)

01:02.301 --> 01:05.135
Amy, please, I really
need to talk to you.

01:06.172 --> 01:07.339
Okay, go ahead.

01:07.373 --> 01:10.141
Well, can we go somewhere,
like get coffee or something?

01:10.176 --> 01:11.142
You know I have to go to work.

01:11.177 --> 01:12.143
I still work at the nursery.

01:12.178 --> 01:14.379
I miss you. And I miss Lauren.

01:14.413 --> 01:16.281
Yeah, well, you should
have thought about how much

01:16.315 --> 01:18.416
you were going to miss us
before you slept with Jesse.

01:18.451 --> 01:21.353
I made a mistake, I apologized.
I don't know what else to do.

01:21.387 --> 01:23.321
There is nothing else to do. It's done.

01:23.356 --> 01:25.123
So is this conversation.

01:25.157 --> 01:25.991
After all we've been through together?

01:26.025 --> 01:28.326
I don't think Lauren can forgive you.

01:28.361 --> 01:32.197
And until and unless Lauren
forgives you, we're not friends.

01:32.231 --> 01:37.435
Okay, well, what if instead of
forgiving me, you and Lauren just

01:37.470 --> 01:40.405
forget it ever happened. You know,
that's what Jesse and I agreed to do,

01:40.439 --> 01:42.173
just forget it ever happened.

01:42.208 --> 01:43.408
Yeah, right.

01:43.442 --> 01:46.144
Look, you can't be trusted.
And that's all there is to it.

01:46.178 --> 01:48.246
Well, is there a way I could
maybe earn back your trust?

01:48.281 --> 01:50.415
How?

01:50.449 --> 01:51.683
I don't know, that's what
parents say, you know,

01:51.717 --> 01:54.152
whenever you lose their trust,
that you have to earn it back.

01:54.186 --> 01:57.389
Why does everyone think I'm everyone's
parent? I am not your parent.

01:57.423 --> 02:00.225
And I only want to be a parent to John.

02:00.259 --> 02:03.395
I have to get to work and get to
John right now. So, goodbye, Madison.

02:08.334 --> 02:09.334
<i>AMY: (ON PHONE) Guess
who tried to talk to me?</i>

02:09.368 --> 02:11.068
Who?

02:11.103 --> 02:12.270
The one who shall not be named.

02:12.305 --> 02:15.173
Oh, she tried to talk to me, too.

02:15.207 --> 02:17.175
And so did he. He called me today.

02:17.209 --> 02:18.310
What did he say?

02:18.344 --> 02:20.078
That he wanted me to just
forget it ever happened.

02:20.112 --> 02:22.247
That's exactly what she said.

02:22.281 --> 02:23.348
I'm not gonna do that.

02:23.382 --> 02:25.083
Well, I don't know
how you could do that.

02:25.117 --> 02:27.085
I don't even wanna do that.

02:27.119 --> 02:28.286
I wanna remember that she
slept with my boyfriend,

02:28.321 --> 02:31.189
knowing that I wouldn't sleep with him

02:31.223 --> 02:33.158
because that's the
kind of person she is.

02:33.192 --> 02:35.293
And now I don't want that
kind of person as a friend,

02:35.328 --> 02:37.162
<i>especially not as a best friend.</i>

02:37.196 --> 02:39.397
She violated every code.

02:39.432 --> 02:42.300
The best friend code, the
girlfriend code, the woman code.

02:42.335 --> 02:44.369
I really hate her. She's a cheater.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.407
(SCOFFS) My dad's here.

02:49.442 --> 02:52.143
Oh, no. Yeah. Bye.

02:55.481 --> 02:57.148
Who do you hate?

02:57.183 --> 03:00.185
I might as well tell you. Madison.

03:00.219 --> 03:01.386
Because she's a cheater?

03:01.420 --> 03:04.289
Yeah. She's a cheater, she...

03:04.323 --> 03:08.259
Stole my idea for a paper that we
had to write for sociology class.

03:08.294 --> 03:13.164
Then I got in trouble
for having the same topic.

03:13.199 --> 03:16.034
It's interesting that
she'd wanna take your topic,

03:16.068 --> 03:19.137
I mean, Madison's a journalist.
She should be full of ideas

03:19.171 --> 03:22.173
and I'd think she'd wanna do her
own research and write her own paper.

03:22.208 --> 03:25.276
You don't know anything about her
and if you did, you'd hate her, too.

03:26.412 --> 03:28.346
I don't hate anyone.

03:28.381 --> 03:29.347
What was the paper about?

03:30.316 --> 03:32.217
About hating people.

03:32.251 --> 03:35.320
And why are you always
snooping around my door?

03:35.354 --> 03:36.121
Do you ever think
about closing your door?

03:36.155 --> 03:38.256
You ever heard of knocking?

03:41.227 --> 03:43.194
I just wanted to let you
know I'm leaving for work.

03:44.230 --> 03:45.397
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

03:47.099 --> 03:48.366
Hello?

03:48.401 --> 03:50.301
<i>RICKMy mom wants us to come
over for dinner tonight.</i>

03:50.336 --> 03:52.404
What do you think? It's a school
night. You have a lot of homework?

03:52.438 --> 03:54.205
Uh, not really, but do we have to?

03:54.240 --> 03:58.076
No, we don't have to. I don't want to.

03:58.110 --> 04:00.145
But she's my mom and
she wants us over there.

04:00.179 --> 04:01.279
Well, I just don't know if I really
feel like seeing her and Shakur tonight.

04:01.313 --> 04:02.313
Not that mom.

04:02.348 --> 04:04.349
Nora?

04:04.383 --> 04:06.351
<i>RICKYeah. At my house?</i>

04:06.385 --> 04:08.987
At your dad's house, with your dad.

04:09.021 --> 04:10.221
Um, all right. Well, do you
want me to meet you over there?

04:10.256 --> 04:13.224
You don't want to have
dinner with my mom and dad,

04:13.259 --> 04:16.027
but you want to have dinner with
your dad and Nora? What's that about?

04:16.062 --> 04:17.262
Nothing. It's just, I don't know,

04:17.296 --> 04:19.329
your mom and dad are like parents

04:19.365 --> 04:23.001
and I don't want to be with Dad
either, but I don't mind Nora so much.

04:23.035 --> 04:25.136
She's fun and she makes
my dad totally tolerable.

04:25.171 --> 04:27.238
So, I'll see you over there, okay?

04:27.273 --> 04:29.140
I love you. I gotta go
or I'm gonna be late.

04:29.175 --> 04:30.241

04:50.662 --> 04:53.855
Hey.
How's summer school going?

04:54.465 --> 04:57.073
It sucks. It totally sucks.
It's a complete waste of time.

04:57.316 --> 05:00.201
Is it? Or are you just totally wasted?

05:00.441 --> 05:03.338
No. I am not totally
wasted or even wasted.

05:03.476 --> 05:05.773
Does everyone know about that?
Yeah.

05:06.956 --> 05:07.844
I don't care.

05:08.028 --> 05:10.957
Come on, you're dating a pothead?
Dylan is not a pothead, okay?

05:10.972 --> 05:13.040
She smokes a little pot now and then.

05:13.074 --> 05:15.176
(SCOFFS) That's what
my mother used to do.

05:15.210 --> 05:17.011
Smoke a little pot now and then.

05:17.045 --> 05:18.312
Then she went on to
bigger and better things.

05:18.346 --> 05:21.215
(SIGHS) I don't need
the evils of marijuana.

05:21.249 --> 05:24.218
I'm gonna get more of that
at dinner tonight with my dad.

05:24.252 --> 05:28.122
And what part of Amy's family
will you be dining with?

05:28.156 --> 05:32.059
Principal Nash, he sent
of summer school studentss

05:32.093 --> 05:35.196
encouraging them to use
with their childrenond

05:35.230 --> 05:37.331
who apparently have
problems in summer school.

05:37.365 --> 05:40.000
I'm not in summer school.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.136
Her dad and my mom. Nora.

05:42.170 --> 05:46.273
Well, that'll probably be
at my house with my dad.er

05:46.308 --> 05:49.043
Oh? What's the problem?
you to smoke pot?want

05:49.077 --> 05:52.012
(CHUCKLES) Not funny.
to see Dylan.t want me

05:52.047 --> 05:52.846
The girl you were smoking pot with?

05:52.881 --> 05:56.183
Look, I just tried it, okay? And...

05:56.218 --> 05:58.319
Look, it was stupid
and I shouldn't have.

05:58.353 --> 06:00.955
But I did and I'm not gonna do it again.

06:00.989 --> 06:03.190
But now I'm forbidden to
see Dylan again, and...

06:03.225 --> 06:04.124
I am going to see Dylan again.

06:04.159 --> 06:06.961
I don't care what the punishment is.

06:06.995 --> 06:08.162
I don't care what he does to me.

06:08.196 --> 06:11.098
(CHUCKLES) Really? Even
if he disinherits you?

06:11.967 --> 06:12.800
Yeah.

06:12.834 --> 06:14.969
Even if he loses all respect for you?

06:15.003 --> 06:16.971
I think he's already done that.

06:17.005 --> 06:19.006
Even if he feels he can
never the rest of your life?

06:19.040 --> 06:22.142
Yeah, look, I think he already
has lost all respect for me

06:22.177 --> 06:24.278
and he doesn't trust me
now. So, what can I do?

06:24.312 --> 06:26.313
You know, I blew it, and
respect me or trust me,t

06:26.348 --> 06:30.084
what have I got to
lose and seeing Dylan?d

06:30.118 --> 06:31.218
Your own self-respect?

06:31.253 --> 06:33.020
He's leaving me no choice.

06:33.054 --> 06:34.388
Sure, he is. You have plenty of choices.

06:34.422 --> 06:36.190
You can, one, do what he
says and not see this girl

06:36.224 --> 06:38.225
and win back his respect and trust.

06:38.260 --> 06:42.229
Or two, you could just find another girl
to go out with who doesn't smoke pot,

06:42.264 --> 06:44.231
there are plenty of them, or three,

06:44.266 --> 06:47.301
you could just not go out for
a while and grow the freak up.

06:47.335 --> 06:49.203
But Dylan doesn't
really smoke pot, okay?

06:49.237 --> 06:51.238
She has, but I don't think
she'll ever do it again.

06:51.273 --> 06:52.139
So I'm going to go out with
her. I'm in love with the girl.

06:52.173 --> 06:54.408
We have everything in common.

06:54.442 --> 06:55.376
Or you can just listen to no one.

06:55.410 --> 06:58.379
Do what you want,
possibly ruin your life.

06:58.413 --> 07:01.348
You had a real happy year last year,
why don't you go for another one?

07:03.218 --> 07:05.185
(SIGHS) That's all I got.

07:05.220 --> 07:07.354
Maybe your dad will have
something better for you at dinner.

07:10.358 --> 07:16.096
Maybe if he agreed that
with this girl,ke again

07:16.131 --> 07:19.066
maybe you could letting him see her,

07:19.100 --> 07:22.236
after you've talked
to the girl's parents.d

07:22.270 --> 07:25.039
You don't want to
distance yourself from him,

07:25.073 --> 07:28.108
after all, you wanna get closer.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.243
Yeah, you know, uh,
I do wanna get closer,

07:29.277 --> 07:33.180
I want us to have an adult relationship.

07:33.214 --> 07:36.216
It's time for us to grow into
that at this point, but how?

07:36.251 --> 07:40.321
He's not an adult. right now.impossible

07:40.355 --> 07:45.326
I mean there are no girls
out for him to go out with?ot

07:45.360 --> 07:48.028
He couldn't take a little break here?

07:48.063 --> 07:51.065
After everything that's
happened and not date at all?

07:51.099 --> 07:55.069
It's tough to navigate
these waters, Leo, it is.

07:55.103 --> 07:57.137
But I suggest you do
have dinner with him.

07:57.172 --> 08:00.207
I think that letter that
is a good idea. all of us

08:00.241 --> 08:04.345
It's good to keep communication open.

08:04.379 --> 08:07.214
After all, they've got to eat, right?

08:07.248 --> 08:09.249
Might as well take advantage of it.

08:09.284 --> 08:14.221
And dinner conversation
has to be communication,

08:14.255 --> 08:16.323
not interrogation,

08:16.358 --> 08:21.095
and I got to tell you, as someone who
asks a lot of questions for a living,

08:21.129 --> 08:24.031
it's not easy for me to
follow my own advice on that.

08:24.065 --> 08:26.166
Well, you don't have
any problems with Lauren.

08:26.201 --> 08:29.336
No, but we still have
problems communicating.

08:29.371 --> 08:33.307
Just this afternoon, I overheard her
saying something about hating Madison

08:33.341 --> 08:37.378
and it hurt me to hear her
say she hates her best friend.

08:37.412 --> 08:40.246
How could she not? I mean, after
Madison slept with her boyfriend.

08:43.351 --> 08:45.285
Oh, look, time's up.

08:45.320 --> 08:50.124
We'll go off the clock. I'd like
to talk to you a few minutes more.

08:58.066 --> 08:59.366
Hey, Mopey Head.

09:04.038 --> 09:06.240
Still listening to sad music?

09:06.274 --> 09:07.074
I don't have anything else to do.

09:07.108 --> 09:09.143
Other than my stupid homework.

09:09.177 --> 09:11.211
Well, that kind of comes with
the territory, doesn't it?

09:11.246 --> 09:14.047
You chose summer school. You must
have known there'd be homework.

09:14.082 --> 09:18.252
Yeah. I just didn't know I wouldn't
be doing it with my best friends.

09:18.286 --> 09:20.020
How'd it go with Amy?
Did you talk to her?

09:20.054 --> 09:23.023
Yeah. But it didn't help.

09:23.057 --> 09:25.259
She's not going to be my friend
unless Lauren forgives me.

09:25.293 --> 09:27.161
It's just ridiculous that
you girls are fighting.

09:27.195 --> 09:28.362
The three of you are going
to end your friendship

09:28.396 --> 09:31.031
because you bought the
same backpack as Lauren?

09:31.065 --> 09:33.233
Well, she wanted to be
the only one that had it.

09:33.268 --> 09:36.270
You know, she said that I copied
her, and that I copy her on everything

09:36.304 --> 09:38.238
and that I want everything she has.

09:38.273 --> 09:41.041
She even thinks I want her boyfriend.

09:41.075 --> 09:41.942
Well, that's just ridiculous.

09:41.976 --> 09:44.044
Yeah. I don't even want her boyfriend.

09:44.078 --> 09:46.213
I'm not even attracted to him.

09:46.247 --> 09:50.384
He smiles too much. He's always
just smiling and smiling and smiling.

09:50.418 --> 09:52.152
(SIGHS) I hate that in a guy.

09:52.187 --> 09:56.290
So, I guess I'm just going to
have to find some new best friends.

09:56.324 --> 09:59.359
Oh, honey, I hate to see you like this.

09:59.394 --> 10:02.362
Girls can be so mean sometimes.

10:02.397 --> 10:04.231
But I'm sure this all can be fixed.

10:04.265 --> 10:04.665
I'm sure it can't.

10:04.699 --> 10:06.366
Well, we'll see.

10:06.401 --> 10:09.169
Yeah.

10:09.204 --> 10:11.371
I tell you what. Why don't the
two of us go out to dinner tonight?

10:11.406 --> 10:13.373
Emily has book club tonight.

10:13.408 --> 10:15.075
You got that letter?

10:15.109 --> 10:16.243
Yes, I did.

10:16.277 --> 10:16.677
(SIGHS) All right.

10:16.711 --> 10:18.445
It'll be fun.

10:22.217 --> 10:25.185
Hey, did you ask me to
ask Amy to come to dinner

10:25.220 --> 10:28.322
just because George got some letter
from the principal about family dinners?

10:28.356 --> 10:29.456
Yeah.

10:29.491 --> 10:32.326
<i>RICKI don't wanna have
dinner with George.</i>

10:32.360 --> 10:34.328
<i>You wanna have dinner,</i>

10:34.362 --> 10:37.331
just the two of us? We haven't
done that in a long time.

10:37.365 --> 10:40.167
And we're a family, too, you and me.

10:40.201 --> 10:42.369
Well, isn't that sweet? Yeah, I'd
love to have dinner, just you and me.

10:42.403 --> 10:44.404
You tell George.

10:44.439 --> 10:46.918
I'll tell George. You tell Amy.

10:58.909 --> 10:59.942
Lauren?

10:59.977 --> 11:01.410
What?

11:01.445 --> 11:05.014
Hey, Mom's working late and I'm
starving. Let's go have some dinner.

11:05.048 --> 11:07.884
I know about the letter.
And I don't feel like it.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.986
We already talked. We
just talked this afternoon.

11:10.020 --> 11:13.956
No, we didn't really talk this
afternoon, let's go have some dinner.

11:13.991 --> 11:14.957
I'll pick you up in 15 minutes.

11:14.992 --> 11:16.259
I just said I don't feel like it.

11:16.293 --> 11:19.228
And I just said I'll
pick you up in 15 minutes.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.133
(PHONE RINGING)

11:26.103 --> 11:26.435
Fifteen minutes.

11:26.470 --> 11:27.904
Excuse me?

11:30.140 --> 11:32.074
Oh, I'm so sorry, I thought
this was someone else.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.209
Who's calling, please?

11:33.243 --> 11:35.912
<i>It's Madison's dad, Morgan.</i>

11:35.946 --> 11:37.246
I guess we haven't
talked in a long time.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.948
No, we haven't.

11:38.982 --> 11:40.983
<i>Well, maybe we should.
Maybe we all should.</i>

11:41.018 --> 11:43.052
You and Lauren and me and Madison.

11:43.086 --> 11:44.921
Do you really think that's a good idea?

11:44.955 --> 11:46.255
I was hoping that you'd
think it was a good idea.

11:46.290 --> 11:49.959
I took the idea right
out of one of your books.

11:49.993 --> 11:53.996
Chapter seven, confronting
the problem head-on.

11:54.031 --> 11:58.034
Oh, yeah. You're right.
Or I guess I'm right.

11:58.068 --> 12:00.903
But I just told Lauren I'd pick her
up in 15 minutes to take her to dinner.

12:00.938 --> 12:03.072
She didn't want to go with
me, so I know she's not gonna

12:03.106 --> 12:06.209
want to go if I tell her that
you and Madison want to join us.

12:06.243 --> 12:08.911
And I know why.

12:08.946 --> 12:12.081
Yeah. Apparently she thinks that
Madison wants everything that's hers.

12:12.115 --> 12:13.916
Interesting way of putting it.

12:13.951 --> 12:16.986
<i>It just seems that they've been
friends for such a long time</i>

12:17.020 --> 12:18.621
<i>that there must be some way
to bring them back together.</i>

12:18.655 --> 12:24.126
I mean, I hate to see them lose a lifetime
friendship over a guy and a backpack.

12:24.161 --> 12:25.995
I don't know anything
about the backpack,

12:26.029 --> 12:29.131
but I think I'd have to have
several dinners with Lauren

12:29.166 --> 12:31.033
before she'd have dinner
with you and Madison.

12:31.068 --> 12:32.902
"But the more that time that goes by,

12:32.936 --> 12:35.071
"the more difficult it's
going to be to mend this rift."

12:35.105 --> 12:36.205
Now you're quoting me.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.273
And I think we should call George.

12:37.307 --> 12:39.075
Juergens?

12:39.109 --> 12:41.143
It really is about the three of them.

12:41.178 --> 12:41.911

Well, yeah.

Where have you been?

12:52.122 --> 12:54.290
Where have I been?

12:54.324 --> 12:57.293
Well, I went by my house to pick up
some things, and I found a letter.

12:57.327 --> 13:00.062
The principal sent my mother a letter!

13:00.097 --> 13:02.899
I mean, maybe he found out that I got
kicked out of med camp and I'm living here

13:02.933 --> 13:03.933
(GASPS) and maybe he
knows I'm lying to her.

13:03.967 --> 13:06.903
Everyone got that letter.

13:06.937 --> 13:08.204
Wait, everyone's in trouble?

13:08.238 --> 13:10.172
It's a stupid letter from the
principal saying that he wants

13:10.207 --> 13:12.942
"parents to have dinner with
their children more often."

13:12.976 --> 13:14.310
What? Why?

13:14.344 --> 13:17.013
I don't know. It's supposed to
help bond the family together,

13:17.047 --> 13:19.215
somehow cut down drug
use, alcohol, all that.

13:19.249 --> 13:22.084
But we're not doing drugs,
and we're not drinking, and...

13:22.119 --> 13:25.087
(SCOFFS) I'm really close to my mother.

13:25.122 --> 13:26.989
Or I was, until I started
lying to her all the time.

13:27.024 --> 13:30.159
I'm a big, fat liar!

13:30.193 --> 13:31.093
Well, you could go to
dinner with me and my family

13:31.128 --> 13:32.194
'cause they got that letter, too

13:32.229 --> 13:35.231
and now we have to go
over there for dinner.

13:35.265 --> 13:36.933

I think I'm gonna see if I
can get my mom on the phone.

13:52.115 --> 13:55.051
I wanna talk to her. I mean,
I'm gonna see her in a few days

13:55.085 --> 13:58.054
and I wanna tell her before
I see her face-to-face.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.922
Fine. I have to go.

That's okay. Thanks for telling Nora

Lauren, wasn't it nice to get a
home-cooked meal and not go out,

have some time with your friends?

have dinner with your friends.

Yeah, it's a simple
question. How old is he?

16:16.950 --> 16:19.051
He's 20, 21, something like that.

16:19.086 --> 16:22.922

16:22.956 --> 16:24.090

16:24.124 --> 16:26.058
She's turning 19. She's a grown woman.

She can date either
20 or 21-year-olds.

She's going to college

Legally, there's a big
difference between 20 and 21.

drinking age is 21.

Can we just talk about you and not me?

16:47.114 --> 16:49.882

16:49.916 --> 16:52.051
I am very angry right now

be sexually involved with a guy

pothead from that private school.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.083
Oh, come on. Ben?

17:24.117 --> 17:26.152
Yeah. I heard he got busted by Leo,

smoking in his bedroom with
this girl and her friends.

What did Leo do?

17:36.963 --> 17:37.930
I don't know.

17:40.033 --> 17:43.035
The thing is I know what it
sounds like, Ben's history.

17:43.070 --> 17:46.138
Ninth grade, he starts high school.

17:46.173 --> 17:49.875
First day, he falls in love with
a girl who got pregnant that summer

17:49.910 --> 17:54.180
the first time she had sex with
a guy she just met at band camp.

17:54.214 --> 17:56.182
He was crazy about her.

17:56.216 --> 18:02.054
Eventually she fell in love with
the baby's father, and Ben...

18:02.089 --> 18:04.957
Ben not being in a good place,

18:04.991 --> 18:09.862
had sex with another girl and, well...

18:09.896 --> 18:13.165
They both took precautions but things
went wrong and she ended up pregnant,

18:13.200 --> 18:15.034
and he stood by her.

18:15.068 --> 18:18.037
He married her. He did the right thing.

18:18.071 --> 18:21.006
Unfortunately, the baby was stillborn.

18:21.041 --> 18:24.143
So my Ben has been through a lot.

18:24.177 --> 18:27.146
Yeah, which is why he
probably got drunk that time.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.818
Thank you for reminding me. Yes, he did.

18:32.853 --> 18:37.089
He was so distraught. One night,
he went out and had a few too many.

18:37.124 --> 18:40.126
But I'm not making excuses.

18:40.160 --> 18:45.197
I'm just saying, uh, my Ben has
made mistakes but he's a good kid.

18:45.232 --> 18:48.100
And you know what, Dylan, I realized
the same may be true about you.

18:50.036 --> 18:53.105
You may have made
some mistakes yourself,

18:53.140 --> 18:54.874
but you may also be a good kid.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.843
She is a good kid.

18:57.878 --> 18:59.845
A very good kid. An excellent kid.

Almost perfect.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.914
Almost.

may be getting at is...

19:07.120 --> 19:07.820
Is what?

19:09.956 --> 19:11.991
That wasn't Ben's pot we were smoking

19:13.927 --> 19:15.060
and he didn't bring it from the party.

19:38.084 --> 19:41.921
We just want to apologize for any
misunderstandings about, you know...

19:41.955 --> 19:43.956
You. So, we should be going.

19:43.990 --> 19:45.991
We were just invited for cocktails.

19:46.026 --> 19:49.828
Well, not cocktails.
Beverages and canapes.

19:49.863 --> 19:50.863
Uh, but, you could stay for dinner.

19:50.897 --> 19:53.098
They could stay for dinner, right, Dad?

19:53.133 --> 19:55.000
We should talk. We should all talk.

19:55.035 --> 19:57.970
I don't think so, Ben. Thank you.

19:58.004 --> 20:00.773
And, uh, we'll take care of it.

20:00.807 --> 20:02.942
And, uh, I'll get back to you.

20:02.976 --> 20:03.976
One of us will.

20:05.045 --> 20:06.145
Good night. Good night.

20:06.179 --> 20:07.112
Thank you. Bye, Ben.

20:12.819 --> 20:14.153
What did you do?

20:16.890 --> 20:19.892
We'll talk about it at
dinner. It's not all bad.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.130
(SIGHS) Ice cream?

20:26.199 --> 20:29.034
Um, no, no thanks.

20:29.069 --> 20:31.136
I'm just going to help you
get this stuff cleaned up

20:31.171 --> 20:33.906
and then I better get John and get home.

20:35.075 --> 20:36.942
I swear I didn't know.

20:36.977 --> 20:38.110
Morgan called and he said there was
a problem between the three of you

20:38.144 --> 20:40.846
and he'd love it if we
could all get together

20:40.880 --> 20:42.114
and I already cooked 'cause I thought

20:42.148 --> 20:43.916
you and Ricky and Nora and
me were going to have dinner.

20:43.950 --> 20:46.085
I thought this was way
better, don't you think?

20:46.119 --> 20:48.921
I really had no idea anything was
going on with you and Madison and Lauren

20:48.955 --> 20:49.855
because someone didn't tell me.

20:49.889 --> 20:51.190
Someone waited to text me during dinner.

20:51.958 --> 20:54.793
I didn't know what else to do.

20:54.828 --> 20:56.095
Nice poker face, Dad.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.997
(SIGHS)

20:58.031 --> 20:59.999
She slept with him?
What happened to Jack?

21:00.033 --> 21:03.002
(SCOFFS) I don't know.

21:03.036 --> 21:07.106
Jack's always been in love with Grace.
I mean, Jack's obsessed with Grace.

21:07.140 --> 21:11.844
And I think Madison just
wanted to be with someone

21:11.878 --> 21:13.979
and that someone who
was convenient was Jesse.

21:14.014 --> 21:15.881
Are you really never
going to talk to her again?

21:15.915 --> 21:18.717
Well, I talk to her. When I have to.

21:18.752 --> 21:20.119
But I don't like her anymore.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.921
I mean, I feel sorry for her,
but I just don't like her anymore.

21:22.956 --> 21:25.057
I don't like that she would do something
like that to someone, especially Lauren.

21:25.091 --> 21:27.826
What about Jesse? Are
you speaking to him?

21:27.861 --> 21:29.795
Is Lauren speaking to him?

21:29.829 --> 21:31.964
He called Lauren, but she doesn't
like him anymore and neither do I.

21:31.998 --> 21:35.834
And she doesn't like
Madison anymore either.

21:35.869 --> 21:37.903
Well, that's a shame that that
happened, but things like that happen.

21:40.040 --> 21:44.777
Yeah, well this is how that happened.

21:44.811 --> 21:48.080
Madison was feeling bad about herself
because she and Jack aren't together anymore.

21:48.114 --> 21:50.015
And she knew that Jesse had
been trying to sleep with Lauren,

21:50.050 --> 21:53.886
and she knew Lauren didn't
wanna sleep with him.

21:53.920 --> 21:57.956
And, so, maybe it was a mistake but
she had to have thought about it.

21:57.991 --> 22:00.893
Did you think about it the
night you first slept with Ricky?

22:00.927 --> 22:02.895
I mean, maybe, like you,
she was just making out

22:02.929 --> 22:04.663
and then things went farther
than she thought they would go.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.632
We're talking about Madison.

22:06.666 --> 22:08.033
I hadn't had sex before
I slept with Ricky

22:08.068 --> 22:09.134
and I didn't know what I was
doing. She knew what she was doing.

22:09.169 --> 22:11.637
Ricky knew what he was
doing. And you forgave him.

22:11.671 --> 22:12.705
Eventually.

22:12.739 --> 22:14.840
It seems to me the longer
you wait to forgive her,

22:14.874 --> 22:17.910
and I know you're gonna forgive her,
the worse the summer is going to be.

22:17.944 --> 22:20.946
It was a dumb thing. People do dumb
things. I'm the king of dumb things.

22:20.980 --> 22:23.916
But you're gonna get
over it, so get over it.

22:23.950 --> 22:28.020
No. I'm not just going
to get over it, Dad.

22:28.054 --> 22:30.956
My best friend slept with my
other best friend's boyfriend.

22:30.990 --> 22:32.991
She's not my best friend anymore.

22:33.026 --> 22:35.794
Are you really in any
place to judge anyone?

22:35.829 --> 22:36.995
I mean, just because things
turned out good for you

22:37.030 --> 22:37.863
doesn't make you
better than anyone else.

22:37.897 --> 22:39.898
Just look at our family.

22:49.743 --> 22:54.713
You know, maybe it's family dinners
that drive kids to drink and do drugs.

22:56.928 --> 22:56.928
+

23:00.570 --> 23:03.472
I ran up at lunch, put it in the
slow cooker. It's good, isn't it?

23:03.506 --> 23:05.608
Yeah! How'd you learn to cook?

23:06.409 --> 23:07.476
Uh...

23:07.510 --> 23:11.480
Oh, Shakur and Margaret.

23:11.514 --> 23:15.451
It's basically knowing how to read and
making the effort. It's not that hard.

23:15.485 --> 23:18.354
Well, everything is delicious.

23:18.388 --> 23:21.590
The brisket, the
roasted corn, the salad.

23:21.625 --> 23:25.661
I'm just glad we get to
have this dinner together.

23:25.695 --> 23:28.430
Just the two of us, a
little family dinner.

23:30.533 --> 23:32.701
So, let me ask you something.

23:34.437 --> 23:37.473
Who do you love more, me or Margaret?

23:37.507 --> 23:38.440
Seriously?

23:39.342 --> 23:40.509
Yeah.

23:40.543 --> 23:41.644
Margaret, I guess. Really?

23:41.678 --> 23:45.547
Yeah, but if it's any
consolation, Amy loves you best.

23:45.582 --> 23:49.251
Aw, that's sweet, but
let's get back to you.

23:49.286 --> 23:51.520
What do I have to do to
get you to love me best?

23:51.554 --> 23:55.457
I love you, but she was a
mom to me when I needed a mom.

23:55.492 --> 23:58.360
Besides, I thought if I said I loved
her best, you'd work a little harder.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.261
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

23:59.296 --> 24:00.629
You're joking, aren't you?

24:00.664 --> 24:03.399
Yeah. Kind of.

24:03.433 --> 24:08.304
Well, then, I'm kind of gonna rub this
dinner in her face next time I see her.

24:08.338 --> 24:10.406
She was a mother to you
when you needed one, too,

24:10.440 --> 24:12.441
which is another reason
I love her so much.

24:12.475 --> 24:14.510
Yeah, I forgot about that.

24:14.544 --> 24:15.611
I'm really happy that we're
getting to know each other.

24:15.645 --> 24:17.579
I feel the same way.

24:19.582 --> 24:23.419
Thank you, Ricky. Thank
you for forgiving me.

24:23.453 --> 24:27.323
And for letting me have this
time with you and Amy and John.

24:27.357 --> 24:30.392
I mean, if I were you, I would have
hated my guts till the day I died.

24:30.427 --> 24:34.263
(CHUCKLES) What good would that have
done? And you were a victim, too.

24:34.297 --> 24:39.401
Yeah, well, better we both hate
your father than hate each other.

24:39.436 --> 24:42.371
It's better we hate no one.
But I am never forgiving him.

24:42.405 --> 24:45.274
You know, some things you forgive,
some things you don't, or I don't.

24:45.308 --> 24:47.576
We had some dinners didn't
we, when you were growing up?

24:47.610 --> 24:50.612
I don't remember any
dinners. Family dinners?

24:50.647 --> 24:53.482
You don't remember the night
your father had me stand against

24:53.516 --> 24:56.352
the dining room wall while
he threw knives at me?

24:56.386 --> 24:59.555
(IMITATES IMPACTS) My reflexes
are still like lightening.

24:59.589 --> 25:01.390
I remember. I just don't think
it's funny. It was terrifying.

25:03.660 --> 25:04.560
Hmm. I wasn't terrified.

25:04.594 --> 25:07.496
You were high. Did you forget that?

25:07.530 --> 25:12.334
Oh. You're right. I did forget that.

25:15.438 --> 25:20.609
But my point was I did try to have
family dinners when you were growing up.

25:20.643 --> 25:23.479
Well, thank you for that.

25:23.513 --> 25:24.380
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

25:26.383 --> 25:28.317
NORA: So sad... I'm sorry.

25:38.595 --> 25:40.295
(SIGHS) I forgot to call her.

25:41.498 --> 25:44.233
Oh, I'll be on my way.

25:44.267 --> 25:46.268
Yeah, I'll take you.
Just hold on a minute.

25:49.539 --> 25:52.374
I meant to call you, but how'd
it go? Dinner with your dad.

25:52.409 --> 25:54.376
Well, we weren't laughing.

25:54.411 --> 25:56.378
No? No.

25:56.413 --> 25:57.813
And you didn't just forget to call me.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.516
You didn't want to call me and tell
me that you weren't coming over.

26:00.550 --> 26:02.518
My dad let Madison and her dad,

26:02.552 --> 26:04.286
and Lauren and her dad come over

26:04.320 --> 26:05.487
since you and Nora
weren't going to be there.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.257
I didn't know. How's Dr. Fields?

26:08.291 --> 26:09.591
How do you think he is?

26:09.626 --> 26:11.527
Madison slept with his
daughter's boyfriend.

26:11.561 --> 26:13.362
Right. I forgot.

26:13.396 --> 26:14.363
You forgot? How can you just
forget something like that?

26:17.300 --> 26:18.934
So why were they all
over there for dinner?

26:18.968 --> 26:22.604
I don't know. I guess they thought it
would all end up in happiness or something.

26:22.639 --> 26:25.340
With me, Madison and
Lauren all friends again.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.608
And did it? No.

26:26.643 --> 26:28.444
All right, well, I'm just
gonna give you some time

26:28.478 --> 26:31.513
and I'll take my mom back to your dad's.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.550
Bye. Night, John. I'll
be back to tuck you in.

26:37.620 --> 26:40.422
I'll get those later.
Let's get out of here.

26:40.457 --> 26:41.457
Are we in trouble?

26:41.491 --> 26:43.358
Yes. Let's go. Hurry up.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.527
Bye, Amy! He loves you.

26:45.562 --> 26:46.628
(MOUTHING)

26:51.367 --> 26:53.368
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

26:53.403 --> 26:54.336
JACK: It's me, Grace.

26:55.405 --> 26:56.305
(SIGHS)

27:02.278 --> 27:03.278
Hungry?

27:03.313 --> 27:04.346
How did you know?

27:04.380 --> 27:05.547
Adrian called me. She's
hanging out with her mom

27:05.582 --> 27:09.284
and she said you might like
some food and some company.

27:09.319 --> 27:09.418
Come on in.

27:12.322 --> 27:12.387
You're welcome.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.557
What is this?

27:15.592 --> 27:18.427
Oh, it's a vegetarian
lasagna and a salad.

27:18.461 --> 27:21.530
Rachel can really cook when
she's in the big kitchen.

27:21.564 --> 27:24.399
(SCOFFS) So you and
Rachel and her kids and Tom

27:24.434 --> 27:26.468
all had dinner in my house
and you didn't even invite me?

27:26.503 --> 27:27.536
And Milton. Milton's there, too.

27:28.505 --> 27:30.539
You know, I've been thinking...

27:30.573 --> 27:35.210
I think my life really went
downhill after we had sex.

27:35.245 --> 27:36.411
I think that's when my
life took a bad turn.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.447
How has your life taken a bad turn?

27:38.481 --> 27:41.517
(SCOFFS) I don't know, but look at me.

27:41.551 --> 27:42.584
I'm hiding in Adrian's condo, I'm going
to summer school with a bunch of losers

27:42.619 --> 27:45.587
and lying to my mother.

27:45.622 --> 27:49.291
Then go home, drop out of summer
school and stop lying to your mother.

27:49.325 --> 27:51.460
I'm not the problem. Having
sex with me wasn't the problem.

27:51.494 --> 27:52.327
You' just making it the problem.

27:55.398 --> 27:57.299
Thank you for the lasagna. Good night.

27:57.333 --> 27:58.300
Good night.

28:00.403 --> 28:02.271
And by the way, this
doesn't bother me at all.

28:02.305 --> 28:03.505
It was just what I was expecting.

28:03.540 --> 28:04.506
You can ask Adrian. I
told her this would happen.

28:04.541 --> 28:06.441
Good night.

28:15.552 --> 28:16.451
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

28:25.261 --> 28:26.395
Hello?

28:26.429 --> 28:28.397
Grace, is that you?

28:28.431 --> 28:31.567
Mom! I've been trying to reach
you. I've been calling and calling.

28:31.601 --> 28:33.468
I just went downstairs
to grab something to eat.

28:33.503 --> 28:35.504
I'm eating, too. Jack
just brought over dinner.

28:35.538 --> 28:39.274
Oh? Well, that was nice of him.

28:39.309 --> 28:44.179
I'm keeping my promise. I didn't
let him stay. No boys this summer.

28:44.213 --> 28:46.381
Didn't let him stay? Stay where?

28:49.319 --> 28:53.355
Honey, I know. I know what you're
doing. I know you're at Adrian's.

28:53.389 --> 28:54.423
I know you're going to summer school.

28:54.457 --> 28:57.292
Tom told me. Tom told you?

28:57.327 --> 28:59.494
Yeah, he told me after
the first day I got here

28:59.529 --> 29:00.529
and I was just waiting
for you to tell me.

29:00.563 --> 29:04.299
I'm actually really
happy to get your message.

29:04.334 --> 29:08.370
You were? Yes, I was.

29:08.404 --> 29:09.304
I'm really happy that you
decided to tell me the truth.

29:09.572 --> 29:12.441
I'm really sorry.

29:12.475 --> 29:15.210
Honey, me too. I'm sorry I
didn't let you make the decision

29:15.244 --> 29:18.280
about that on your own.

29:18.314 --> 29:23.318
I mean, I was disappointed that
you lied, but you know what?

29:23.353 --> 29:24.186
I thought you would do
just what you're doing.

29:24.220 --> 29:27.589
I want to stay here.
Just for the summer.

29:27.624 --> 29:31.460
Why don't you decide after I
tell you what I want to tell you.

29:31.494 --> 29:35.430
And what's that? Turns out that your dad

29:35.465 --> 29:39.267
came over here every year to
do more than just help people.

29:39.302 --> 29:41.536
What? Grace,

29:42.639 --> 29:45.440
your dad had a girlfriend here.

29:47.276 --> 29:48.477
<i>Apparently for quite some time.</i>

29:48.511 --> 29:50.612
What?

29:50.647 --> 29:51.380
Yeah.

29:56.696 --> 29:56.696
+

29:57.477 --> 29:58.764
Hey, you want to, uh...

30:04.095 --> 30:04.961
Have a drink?

30:04.996 --> 30:06.229
Yeah, I don't think that's good idea.

30:06.264 --> 30:07.164
It's just, uh, I really
enjoyed talking to you tonight.

30:07.198 --> 30:10.467
And I could see why you like this girl.

30:10.501 --> 30:11.701
I would have never guessed she
smoked pot. She looks like an angel.

30:11.736 --> 30:16.540
Yeah. She does. e is an angel.

30:16.574 --> 30:18.408
Yeah, well, those aren't
wings she's flying on.

30:19.677 --> 30:24.514
Yeah, but like you said,
good people make bad mistakes.

30:24.549 --> 30:26.783
Well, I'll give it to her. She did confess
to her parents that it wasn't your pot.

30:26.818 --> 30:30.620
Of course, she says it wasn't
her pot, it was her friend's.

30:30.655 --> 30:33.423
I don't know whose pot
it was, and I don't care.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.425
I swear she doesn't have a drug problem.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.694
She doesn't. And she's a nice girl.

30:37.728 --> 30:39.629
We'll see.

30:39.664 --> 30:42.532
Yeah, I hope we'll see. I hope
her parents let her see me again.

30:42.567 --> 30:42.899
And if they don't?

30:42.934 --> 30:44.634
We'll see.

30:44.669 --> 30:47.571
Okay, well, defying me is one thing.

30:47.605 --> 30:50.640
Defying her parents,
that's something else.

30:50.675 --> 30:53.376
Unless her parents give you
permission to sleep with her,

30:53.411 --> 30:54.444
I wouldn't go there.

30:54.478 --> 30:55.478
I'm not going to go there.

30:55.513 --> 30:56.980
Is that so?

30:57.014 --> 31:02.752
That is so. I am that desperate to
have one good year of high school.

31:02.787 --> 31:05.422
I'm kind of glad they sent
out that letter to tell parents

31:05.456 --> 31:06.623
to have dinner with their kids.

31:06.657 --> 31:07.557
It worked out pretty well after all.

31:07.592 --> 31:09.492
I don't care about that letter.

31:09.527 --> 31:13.730
We've always had dinners together,
until you got your own place,

31:13.764 --> 31:16.566
and since you've been back, we
just got out of the habit of it.

31:16.601 --> 31:20.604
But believe me, Dylan or no Dylan,
we'll be having dinners, me and you.

31:20.638 --> 31:21.004
And Camille?

31:21.038 --> 31:22.706
And Camille.

31:24.475 --> 31:25.475
Goodnight, Dad.

31:25.509 --> 31:25.542
Night.

31:54.538 --> 31:57.540
Would you get out of here and
let me turn out the lights?

31:57.575 --> 31:59.409
Otherwise I'm going to have to
repeat this entire conversation

31:59.443 --> 32:05.482
when Mom comes home and I can't.
I'm sick of talking to you.

32:05.516 --> 32:06.750
I'm sure a lot of people feel that way.

32:09.720 --> 32:13.390
I just wish you had talked to me sooner.

32:13.424 --> 32:15.558
You never have to lie to me.

32:15.593 --> 32:18.695
You could have told me that no-good
Jesse slept with your best friend.

32:19.397 --> 32:22.365
My no-good best friend.

32:22.400 --> 32:26.403
Lauren, it was a lousy thing she did,

32:26.437 --> 32:29.639
but this is why I think high
school is too soon to be having sex.

32:29.674 --> 32:32.409
Young adults just aren't emotionally
mature enough to handle everything

32:32.443 --> 32:34.477
that goes with the territory.

32:34.512 --> 32:38.381
Why do you keep talking
to me? Go talk to Madison.

32:38.416 --> 32:43.653
Because Madison is not my
daughter. You are my daughter.

32:43.688 --> 32:45.522
And I love you.

32:46.457 --> 32:47.457
Then you hate her.

32:50.361 --> 32:53.697
You know I don't. And
you know you don't either.

32:53.731 --> 32:55.365
You will get over this.

32:55.633 --> 32:59.602
No, Daddy, I won't.
She ruined everything.

32:59.637 --> 33:01.538
Oh.

33:02.606 --> 33:05.675
Listen,

33:05.710 --> 33:10.413
there's just no sense in losing a best
friend and losing a boyfriend, both.

33:10.448 --> 33:14.551
And I know you don't want to put a guy
you've dated on and off for the past year

33:14.585 --> 33:18.555
over your friend who you've
known practically all your life.

33:19.657 --> 33:22.759
I didn't even want him
before she slept with him.

33:24.595 --> 33:27.430
I knew I didn't like him anymore.

33:27.465 --> 33:33.636
But I never said that to her and she didn't
know I felt that way, yet she did that.

33:33.671 --> 33:34.371
Now we're getting somewhere.

33:38.442 --> 33:39.342
I'm sorry.

33:43.347 --> 33:45.415
You want a sandwich?

33:45.449 --> 33:48.585
I'm hungry. We never really got to eat.

33:48.619 --> 33:49.352
I'm starving. Come on.

33:51.455 --> 33:52.288
Yeah.

33:52.323 --> 33:53.423
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

33:54.592 --> 33:56.593
Sleeping.

34:00.664 --> 34:01.698
You can't sleep.

34:04.435 --> 34:06.403
I know you're hungry. Mmm.

34:06.437 --> 34:08.538
I got us some pizza.
You feel like pizza?

34:08.572 --> 34:11.541
No. I'm never eating again
for the rest of my life.

34:11.574 --> 34:14.543
I'd so much rather hear you
say you'll never have sex again

34:14.578 --> 34:16.579
for the rest of your life.

34:16.614 --> 34:20.583
Because, you know, you can live without
sex, but you can't live without food.

34:20.618 --> 34:22.418
Come on, it's your favorite.

34:24.621 --> 34:29.426
I can't. I'm just too embarrassed.

34:31.362 --> 34:33.429
Dad, just turn the lights out

34:33.464 --> 34:37.266
and go and maybe, like, leave a
slice on the dresser or something.

34:37.301 --> 34:37.367
Hey, come on.

34:42.505 --> 34:45.308
What you did is a terrible thing,

34:45.342 --> 34:49.312
but it's not the worst
thing that could ever happen.

34:49.346 --> 34:52.482
I mean, the worst thing that could ever
happen is that you could wind up pregnant,

34:52.516 --> 34:55.284
or wind up with some wicked
awful disease from this.

34:55.319 --> 34:58.421
I'm not completely stupid,
Dad. We used a condom.

34:58.456 --> 35:03.660
All right, I don't need to know
anything else, other than...

35:03.694 --> 35:08.331
You would never do anything
like this again, right?

35:08.365 --> 35:11.668
I could never do this again. I
don't have another best friend.

35:11.702 --> 35:15.405
Have I done something wrong? Is this
about you desperately needing to be loved?

35:15.439 --> 35:16.573
Or something like that?

35:16.607 --> 35:18.608
No. I just...

35:18.642 --> 35:23.346
I did it without thinking about it.

35:23.380 --> 35:30.487
You know? I just did it. And partially
because I knew that I shouldn't do it.

35:30.521 --> 35:35.291
I was just so annoyed at Lauren
for always being so perfect

35:35.326 --> 35:38.394
and I just started talking to
Jesse about it, and we just...

35:41.432 --> 35:43.533
Oh, geez, Dad...

35:43.567 --> 35:50.373
I'm just so weak when a guy tells me
that he wants me or he's attracted to me,

35:50.407 --> 35:54.277
or that I'm pretty.

35:54.311 --> 35:58.548
I'm an idiot. I'm just an idiot.

35:58.582 --> 36:03.586
Well, you're getting smarter. Or you better
get smarter if you want to have any friends.

36:04.555 --> 36:06.589
I know.

36:06.624 --> 36:09.592
Why don't you tell Lauren what you
just told me if that's the truth.

36:09.627 --> 36:14.631
That is the truth. And she won't
talk to me. And she blocked me.

36:14.665 --> 36:18.401
Then write it in a letter. Put it in
your backpack and take it to her tomorrow.

36:27.478 --> 36:28.645
What!

36:28.679 --> 36:29.379
Did you get enough to eat?

36:29.413 --> 36:31.681
Yes. I got enough to eat.

36:31.715 --> 36:35.518
Feel like doing anything?

36:35.553 --> 36:37.387
You trick me into having
dinner alone with my dad

36:37.421 --> 36:37.820
and you think I'm going to
feel like doing anything?

36:37.855 --> 36:40.557
I was hoping.

36:40.591 --> 36:42.492
I didn't wanna have dinner
with your dad just because

36:42.526 --> 36:43.459
of some letter the principal sent out.

36:43.494 --> 36:46.596
Yeah, well, you could
have, I mean for me.

36:46.630 --> 36:49.532
Then it wouldn't have turned
into some big confrontation.

36:49.567 --> 36:52.602
Dinner at your house, Amy, is
always a confrontation of some sort.

36:52.636 --> 36:55.305
What is dinner over at your house?

36:55.339 --> 36:57.407
Here? We had a good time here.

36:57.441 --> 37:01.377
No, I didn't mean our house. I meant when
you have dinner over at Margaret and Shakur's.

37:01.412 --> 37:04.380
It's just food and conversation.
No one goes away upset or hungry.

37:07.318 --> 37:09.319
I would just rather eat with Nora.

37:09.353 --> 37:11.387
I know her better than I
know Margaret and Shakur.

37:11.422 --> 37:14.657
Yeah, you do, because you've
had more meals with Nora.

37:14.692 --> 37:17.527
I'm sure that's why the principal's
pushing for families to have dinner.

37:17.561 --> 37:21.664
My mom and dad insisted on all the
kids having dinner every night together,

37:21.699 --> 37:22.398
no matter what kids were in the house.

37:24.435 --> 37:25.368
We did that, too.

37:27.638 --> 37:29.606
All right, all right, we didn't.

37:29.640 --> 37:33.243
My dad was always working and I always
had band practice or music lessons,

37:33.277 --> 37:37.213
and nobody wanted to eat with Ashley.

37:37.248 --> 37:41.384
Someone always got upset, usually me,
and no one ever finished their dinner.

37:41.418 --> 37:42.318
Well, except for my dad.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.388
I apologize about tonight.

37:45.422 --> 37:49.392
Maybe I should have had dinner with
you and your dad and John and my mom,

37:49.426 --> 37:50.593
and I definitely should have called you.

37:50.628 --> 37:51.561
Yes, you should have.

37:55.399 --> 37:59.235
But maybe it was good that you and
Madison and Lauren all got pushed

37:59.270 --> 38:00.436
into a room together
so you three could talk.

38:03.540 --> 38:05.475
We didn't talk.

38:05.509 --> 38:08.244
Oh, you know you and Lauren are
going to eventually forgive Madison,

38:08.279 --> 38:09.512
so just go on and do it.

38:09.546 --> 38:13.383
Um, no we are not going to forgive her.

38:16.587 --> 38:18.454
I'm gonna have dessert.
you want dessert?

38:18.489 --> 38:19.589
No, I do not want dessert.

38:22.559 --> 38:24.460
(SIGHS)

38:26.530 --> 38:27.430
Cookie?

38:40.344 --> 38:42.578
It's not even that
I'm upset with Madison.

38:42.613 --> 38:48.284
I just feel like I have to be upset with
her for sleeping with Lauren's boyfriend.

38:48.319 --> 38:51.487
Just like I had to be upset with
my dad for cheating on my mom,

38:51.522 --> 38:54.223
and because he used to
be married to Grace's mom.

38:54.258 --> 38:57.460
Well, that wasn't cheating.
That was his first wife.

38:57.494 --> 39:01.230
I know, but still,
it felt like cheating.

39:01.265 --> 39:02.565
Ashley and I used to
call her wife number one,

39:02.599 --> 39:04.534
not just because he was
married to her first,

39:04.568 --> 39:08.471
but he still seemed to care about
her more than he cared about Mom.

39:08.505 --> 39:11.240
I mean, I know that's probably not true,

39:11.275 --> 39:13.643
but I guess we just didn't like the
idea of him ever being with someone else.

39:17.348 --> 39:19.382
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

39:28.659 --> 39:34.497
Jacob. Hi. Is your mom with you?

39:34.531 --> 39:36.566
No. I just wanted to say goodbye.

39:43.640 --> 39:47.543
Okay, but we said goodbye last night

39:47.578 --> 39:50.646
and as I told your
mother, I will think about

39:50.681 --> 39:55.318
the possibility of you staying
with us, but I just don't know.

39:57.521 --> 40:00.556
Please. Please.

40:00.591 --> 40:04.360
If you don't let me live with you, she's
going to send me to boarding school in Paris.

40:04.395 --> 40:08.531
Yeah, well, about that. I mean, wouldn't
you get a better education in Paris

40:08.565 --> 40:10.366
than our neighborhood high school?

40:11.502 --> 40:14.537
First of all, I understand English.

40:14.571 --> 40:17.573
All right? I speak English.
I don't speak French.

40:17.608 --> 40:21.444
And secondly, I want to know
my brother and my sister.

40:21.478 --> 40:25.581
I am sure they want to
get to know you as well.

40:25.616 --> 40:29.285
But I want them to have
some time to absorb all this.

40:29.319 --> 40:31.487
And I don't even feel like I've
had enough time to absorb all this.

40:33.257 --> 40:35.291
I wanna get to know you better.

40:35.325 --> 40:38.394
What else do you want to
know? I'm a good student.

40:38.429 --> 40:41.464
I've never gotten into any trouble. Any.

40:42.499 --> 40:44.400
My mother is a very nice woman.

40:44.435 --> 40:47.403
She is even willing to let me go
because that's what I want to do.

40:49.273 --> 40:50.273
I want to go with you.

40:51.475 --> 40:52.608
I can totally take care of myself.

40:52.643 --> 40:54.610
I can cook. I can sew.

40:54.645 --> 40:56.646
Really? I can sew a button.

40:59.583 --> 41:04.287
(SIGHS) I'm sorry, Jacob. I have to go.

41:04.321 --> 41:06.289
Jeff's picking me up
and I can't be late.

41:08.325 --> 41:10.593
He's a nice man, Dr. Zegay.

41:10.627 --> 41:12.528
Yes.

41:12.563 --> 41:14.630
My father was a nice man, too.

41:14.665 --> 41:16.466
Well let's just say

41:16.500 --> 41:23.188
I hope Jeff is more
honest than your father.
