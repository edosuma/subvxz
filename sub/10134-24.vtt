This morning, your Uncle Jesse

02:26.981 --> 02:31.068
spent 47 minutes in the bathroom

02:31.110 --> 02:33.904
fixing his hair.

02:33.946 --> 02:37.282
He sprayed it.

02:33.946 --> 02:37.282
He moussed it. He gelled it.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.243
I think he even

02:37.324 --> 02:40.243
used my hot rollers.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.286
anything from Aunt Becky.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.913
She's like

03:23.328 --> 03:24.913
my big sister.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.832
Yeah. You can

03:24.955 --> 03:26.832
tell me anything.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.377
Okay. Here's the plan.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.504
I start babysitting

03:30.418 --> 03:32.504
at 7 o'clock.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.673
I'll have the kid

03:32.546 --> 03:34.673
in bed by 7:02.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.801
Perfect. And the guys

03:34.715 --> 03:37.801
are coming at 7:10.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.345
See Aunt Becky, there's this

03:37.843 --> 03:40.345
really cute guy named Ryan

03:40.387 --> 03:42.139
in my biology class.

03:42.181 --> 03:44.599
And we share

03:42.181 --> 03:44.599
the same microscope.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.186
They met over

03:44.641 --> 03:47.186
a drop of pond scum.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.689
Well, it gets better.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.689
I invited Ryan over

03:50.731 --> 03:52.566
to study for finals

03:50.731 --> 03:52.566
with us.

03:52.607 --> 03:56.028
He's even bringing

03:52.607 --> 03:56.028
a friend for Kimmy.

03:56.070 --> 04:00.157
Deej, how does your dad feel

03:56.070 --> 04:00.157
about you inviting boys over

04:00.199 --> 04:02.743
to a house

04:00.199 --> 04:02.743
without any adults?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.411
Well, dad feels fine

04:04.452 --> 04:07.288
'cause

04:04.452 --> 04:07.288
dad doesn't know.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.917
You won't

04:07.330 --> 04:09.917
say anything, will you?

04:09.958 --> 04:11.210
No, I guess not.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.128
- Thanks, Aunt Becky.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.128
- You're welcome.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.588
Hey, you guys

04:13.170 --> 04:14.588
seen Joey?

04:14.629 --> 04:16.215
Uh-uh.

04:16.256 --> 04:21.136
Boy, Uncle Jesse, you're

04:16.256 --> 04:21.136
having a really good hair day.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.262
Really?

04:25.974 --> 04:27.684
Oh, yeah. I guess I am.

04:27.726 --> 04:28.894
It's funny too 'cause

04:27.726 --> 04:28.894
I woke up this morning

04:28.936 --> 04:30.687
and ran my fingers through it.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.733
Just blessed, I guess.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.284
Hurry, hurry!

04:41.073 --> 04:44.284
Comet's having puppies!

04:44.325 --> 04:45.452
What?

04:47.996 --> 04:50.415
Comet's having puppies?

04:50.457 --> 04:51.833
Wait a second.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.501
Comet is a boy.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.503
Ha ha ha.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.089
I fooled you.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.926
Michelle, sit down.

05:03.595 --> 05:06.056
Let me tell you

05:03.595 --> 05:06.056
a story about a little girl

05:06.098 --> 05:08.058
who was watching sheep

05:06.098 --> 05:08.058
and she liked

05:08.100 --> 05:09.977
to fool people by crying wolf.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.897
But, then, the real wolf came

05:10.018 --> 05:13.897
and nobody believed her.

05:13.939 --> 05:17.609
Okay. Tell me the story.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.154
I just did.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.614
No "Once upon a time?"

05:24.199 --> 05:26.576
No "Happy ever after?"

05:28.369 --> 05:29.997
Dumb story.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.459
Why do I bother?

05:36.128 --> 05:38.588
Well, here it is, boys.

05:38.630 --> 05:41.466
The newest addition

05:38.630 --> 05:41.466
to our production company.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.676
Ta-da!

05:42.717 --> 05:44.219
Ha! A pool table.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.014
Alright. Joseph, now this

05:44.261 --> 05:47.014
is a real office.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.723
All we got to do now

05:47.055 --> 05:48.723
is get rid of the desk

05:48.765 --> 05:51.268
and make room

05:48.765 --> 05:51.268
for the water slide.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.894
It just so happens

05:52.936 --> 05:56.064
I rented this pool table

05:52.936 --> 05:56.064
to enhance our creativity.

05:56.106 --> 05:59.067
Jess, you know how sometimes

05:56.106 --> 05:59.067
we get stuck for an idea

05:59.109 --> 06:00.152
what do we usually do?

06:00.194 --> 06:02.154
Throw spit wads

06:00.194 --> 06:02.154
at each other.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.866
Not anymore.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.866
From now on, we play pool.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.951
But it's only to be used

06:05.907 --> 06:07.951
in those rare moments

06:07.993 --> 06:09.244
when we're

06:07.993 --> 06:09.244
stuck for an idea.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.829
Right.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.164
Alright. Well, let's

06:10.871 --> 06:12.164
get some work done.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.372
Okay.

06:16.918 --> 06:17.919
I'm stuck.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.796
Yeah, me too.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.796
Rack 'em up.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.175
Hey, do you guys mind

06:21.131 --> 06:23.175
if I play, too?

06:24.425 --> 06:25.760
Aw, isn't that cute?

06:25.802 --> 06:28.847
Danny wants to play pool

06:25.802 --> 06:28.847
with the big boys.

06:28.889 --> 06:33.268
Daniel, pool is a game of skill,

06:28.889 --> 06:33.268
nerve, and coordination.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.270
You keep score.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.814
Oh, boy. Do I get chalk

06:35.312 --> 06:37.814
and everything?

06:37.856 --> 06:39.358
Yes. Now look, these are

06:37.856 --> 06:39.358
the colored balls.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.901
These are the pockets.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.903
When we get one of the

06:40.942 --> 06:42.903
colored balls into the pocket

06:42.944 --> 06:44.946
you come over here. Run over

06:42.944 --> 06:44.946
here, come here, come here.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.574
You put a little line like that,

06:44.988 --> 06:47.574
see that just like that.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.243
Okay? There you go,

06:47.615 --> 06:49.243
there's your chalk.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.246
Ooh, thanks. This is

06:49.284 --> 06:52.246
more fun than playing.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.706
(Michelle)

06:52.287 --> 06:54.706
'Daddy, come here!

06:52.287 --> 06:54.706
Hurry up!'

06:54.748 --> 06:55.832
Coming, Michelle.

06:55.874 --> 06:56.958
Be right back.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.710
'I'm coming.'

06:58.752 --> 06:59.920
What is it, Michelle?

06:59.961 --> 07:01.546
Are you alright?

07:01.588 --> 07:04.174
There's a mouse over there,

07:01.588 --> 07:04.174
and he has big teeth like this.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.553
A mouse?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.305
But there's no crumbs

07:08.595 --> 07:10.305
on my floor.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.641
That's common knowledge

07:10.347 --> 07:13.641
in the rodent world.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.061
Dad?

07:13.683 --> 07:16.061
What are you doing?

07:16.103 --> 07:18.397
Oh. Michelle

07:16.103 --> 07:18.397
saw a mouse.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.858
Oh, yeah?

07:18.479 --> 07:21.858
Was it having puppies?

07:21.900 --> 07:22.984
Ha ha ha.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.320
I fooled you.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.909
Michelle, it's not nice to try

07:26.947 --> 07:30.909
and fool your dad like that.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.037
I told her the story about

07:30.951 --> 07:34.037
little girl who cried wolf.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.498
I didn't cry wolf.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.498
I cried mouse.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.167
Ha ha ha.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.920
Michelle, that's

07:39.209 --> 07:41.920
really not funny.

07:43.671 --> 07:44.798
Oh, hi, dad. Bye, dad.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.425
I'll be babysitting

07:44.839 --> 07:46.425
with Kimmy.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.552
Whoa, whoa. D.J.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.552
Your biology final is Monday.

07:49.594 --> 07:53.181
Relaxez-vous, Mr. T.

07:49.594 --> 07:53.181
She'll be studying with me.

07:53.223 --> 07:56.684
That's

07:53.223 --> 07:56.684
<i>tres</i> reassuring.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.603
Hey. I know biology.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.606
They made me

07:58.645 --> 08:01.606
take it twice.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.442
D.J., you're studying

08:01.648 --> 08:03.442
in your room tonight.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.526
But, dad, we had

08:03.483 --> 08:05.526
this all planned.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.070
Well, you didn't

08:05.568 --> 08:07.070
plan it with me.

08:07.112 --> 08:10.657
Becky, don't you think

08:07.112 --> 08:10.657
that my dad's being unfair?

08:10.698 --> 08:12.784
Oh, well, Deej, even

08:10.698 --> 08:12.784
if I did agree with you

08:12.826 --> 08:14.035
it's really

08:12.826 --> 08:14.035
not my place--

08:14.077 --> 08:15.662
See, dad, Becky

08:14.077 --> 08:15.662
agrees with me.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.747
That's not what she just said.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.747
Is it, Becky?

08:17.789 --> 08:20.667
Well, no. Not exactly.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.667
What I meant was--

08:20.708 --> 08:22.919
See, Deej?

08:20.708 --> 08:22.919
She agrees with me.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.672
Oh, I'm just going

08:22.961 --> 08:25.672
to go wait over there.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.551
D.J., my point is

08:30.593 --> 08:32.887
it's very important

08:30.593 --> 08:32.887
to get good grades.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.722
There comes

08:32.929 --> 08:34.722
a time in every person's life

08:34.764 --> 08:36.683
when you have

08:34.764 --> 08:36.683
to choose between excellence

08:36.724 --> 08:39.102
and...less

08:36.724 --> 08:39.102
than excellence.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.485
The choice is yours.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.861
Great. I'm going

08:46.526 --> 08:47.861
with Kimmy.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.863
Okay.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.863
The choice is mine.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.449
You're studying in your

08:49.904 --> 08:52.449
room tonight. Case closed.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.783
<i>Au revoir,</i> Kimmy.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.121
Deej, this is awful.

08:58.163 --> 09:02.334
I'm going to be stuck all

08:58.163 --> 09:02.334
alone with those two cute guys.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.127
Alright!

09:05.628 --> 09:06.963
Can you believe this?

09:07.005 --> 09:08.882
Ryan's going to think

09:07.005 --> 09:08.882
I stood him up.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.633
He's gonna hate me forever.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.177
Well, call him

09:10.675 --> 09:12.177
and tell what happened.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.637
It's too late.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.637
He's already on his way.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.015
I have to explain

09:14.679 --> 09:17.015
this in person.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.392
If you saw how cute he was

09:18.433 --> 09:21.186
you'd want to explain

09:18.433 --> 09:21.186
this in person, too.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.979
Can you cover for me?

09:23.021 --> 09:25.732
Oh, Deej,

09:23.021 --> 09:25.732
your dad said no.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.484
Oh, come on, Becky.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.484
Please?

09:27.526 --> 09:30.153
It will be only ten minutes.

09:27.526 --> 09:30.153
I promise.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.906
You said

09:30.195 --> 09:32.906
we were friends.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.574
[sighs]

09:32.947 --> 09:34.574
Alright. Ten minutes.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.535
Thanks, Becky.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.535
You're the best.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.580
Go. Be back in ten minutes

09:36.576 --> 09:40.580
or you're in big trouble.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.416
And so am I.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.047
[doorbell rings]

09:49.089 --> 09:50.173
(D.J.)

09:49.089 --> 09:50.173
'Hi.'

09:50.215 --> 09:52.509
Deej!

09:52.551 --> 09:56.430
- The warden let you out?

09:52.551 --> 09:56.430
- Well, not exactly.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.639
My dad thinks

09:56.471 --> 09:58.639
I'm up in my room studying.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.016
But Becky's gonna cover for me.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.477
I only have ten minutes.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.477
I hope Ryan's not late.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.604
I wonder who he's

10:02.519 --> 10:04.604
bringing for me.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.897
Well, I don't know,

10:04.645 --> 10:05.897
but Ryan said

10:05.939 --> 10:07.315
he was definitely your type.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.942
Excellent.

10:08.983 --> 10:12.195
That means he's six foot two,

10:08.983 --> 10:12.195
drives a red Lamborghini

10:12.237 --> 10:14.697
and knows how to make me

10:12.237 --> 10:14.697
feel like a woman.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.244
Party! Party!

10:20.287 --> 10:21.580
What are you doing up?

10:21.621 --> 10:25.250
I want to watch

10:21.621 --> 10:25.250
"Arachnophobia."

10:25.292 --> 10:28.628
I know you can't tell time yet,

10:25.292 --> 10:28.628
but it's way past your bedtime.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.004
Liar!

10:30.046 --> 10:34.593
I learned how

10:30.046 --> 10:34.593
to tell time last week!

10:34.634 --> 10:40.098
It's only...7:05.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.641
Okay, Aaron, you leave

10:40.140 --> 10:41.641
me no choice

10:41.682 --> 10:43.893
but to sing you another lullaby.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.853
No! Please!

10:45.895 --> 10:49.065
Rock-a-bye baby,

10:45.895 --> 10:49.065
on the tree top!

10:49.107 --> 10:50.650
My ears! My ears!

10:50.691 --> 10:53.612
When the wind blows,

10:50.691 --> 10:53.612
the cradle will rock!

10:55.530 --> 10:56.697
[doorbell rings]

10:56.739 --> 10:58.783
That's the guys.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.494
I've only got

10:58.825 --> 11:00.494
eight minutes to start a deep

11:00.535 --> 11:01.995
meaningful

11:00.535 --> 11:01.995
relationship with Ryan.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.583
- Hi, Ryan.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.583
- Hi, Gibbler.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.918
Hey, Deej.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.421
You look different

11:08.960 --> 11:11.421
outside of school.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.881
I mean, you look

11:11.463 --> 11:13.881
really pretty.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.969
Thanks. You look

11:13.923 --> 11:17.969
really pretty, too.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.640
I mean, really

11:18.011 --> 11:21.640
pretty masculine.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.142
Okay, where is he?

11:21.680 --> 11:24.142
Where's the hunk of my dreams?

11:25.477 --> 11:27.312
Gibbler.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.730
Bitterman?

11:29.772 --> 11:31.983
I guess you two know each other.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.652
Since third grade.

11:33.692 --> 11:36.237
He used to eat my paste.

11:36.279 --> 11:39.366
Come on, Gibbler,

11:36.279 --> 11:39.366
you know you love me.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.994
Excuse me while I barf.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.080
Hey! Those are boys.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.583
You're fired, Gibbler.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.253
You can't fire me.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.253
I quit.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.340
Kimmy, you're babysitting.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.340
You can't quit.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.967
Um, Aaron, what if we

11:55.382 --> 11:57.967
let you stay up late

11:58.009 --> 12:00.470
and watch "Arachnophobia"

11:58.009 --> 12:00.470
in your parents' bedroom?

12:00.512 --> 12:03.431
That's a bribe!

12:03.473 --> 12:04.641
Yes, it is.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.643
I like bribes.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.105
Hey.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.900
Why don't we break up

12:11.147 --> 12:13.900
into study groups?

12:13.941 --> 12:15.569
I'll work with D.J.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.654
Jake, you work with Gibbler.

12:17.696 --> 12:20.990
Ah, the dream team.

12:21.032 --> 12:24.118
Shut off the drool pipe,

12:21.032 --> 12:24.118
Bitterman.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.288
The party's over.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.288
D.J.'s got to go home.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.249
Why don't you walk her?

12:30.458 --> 12:32.877
I really wanted

12:30.458 --> 12:32.877
to hang out with you.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.672
I can't believe you

12:32.919 --> 12:35.672
have to go already.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.925
Why would I go?

12:35.714 --> 12:38.925
I just got here.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.432
Ah-ha!

12:43.555 --> 12:45.432
Kid's still got it.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.142
Pay up, fun boy.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.142
Come on, come on.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.269
It's not whether

12:48.184 --> 12:49.269
you win or lose

12:49.310 --> 12:51.354
it's how you

12:49.310 --> 12:51.354
play the game.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.147
And I stink.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.316
My turn.

12:55.358 --> 12:58.152
Danny, please save yourself

12:55.358 --> 12:58.152
the time and humiliation.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.905
Just empty your

12:58.194 --> 13:00.905
pockets right now.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.781
Oh, come on, Jess.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.781
Just one game.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.325
I want to be able

13:02.823 --> 13:04.325
to tell my grandchildren

13:04.367 --> 13:07.203
that I actually played

13:04.367 --> 13:07.203
"The Kid."

13:07.245 --> 13:09.330
So what are you guys

13:07.245 --> 13:09.330
playing for? Dollar a ball?

13:09.372 --> 13:10.957
No, we're playing

13:09.372 --> 13:10.957
for a quarter a b..

13:10.998 --> 13:13.376
No. Yes, we're playing

13:10.998 --> 13:13.376
for dollar a ball, yeah.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.919
Alright.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.337
You break 'em.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.468
You know, what the heck

13:21.509 --> 13:23.177
why don't we make it

13:21.509 --> 13:23.177
two bucks a ball?

13:23.219 --> 13:26.556
You, uh, you might want to use

13:23.219 --> 13:26.556
the other end of the stick.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.725
Oh.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.645
Oh. No wonder they

13:28.767 --> 13:31.645
call you "The Kid."

13:42.280 --> 13:44.574
Whoa. You just sunk

13:42.280 --> 13:44.574
three balls.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.576
Oh, gee, I just made six bucks.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.953
What a lucky start.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.956
Okay. Split shot. Six ball

13:48.995 --> 13:51.956
in the corner pocket.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.422
Huh, would you

13:56.961 --> 13:59.422
look at that?

13:59.464 --> 14:01.800
I just made two go in.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.554
[rock music]

15:05.697 --> 15:08.491
Five?

15:08.533 --> 15:12.286
Well, Jess, that is

15:08.533 --> 15:12.286
50 balls at $2 a ball.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.874
I believe that's, uh,

15:12.328 --> 15:15.874
one hundred Mr. Washingtons.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.084
Hey, talk about

15:15.915 --> 15:18.084
beginner's luck.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.758
You hustled me, man.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.342
I was supposed

15:24.799 --> 15:26.342
to be hustling you.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.178
I'm glad you

15:26.384 --> 15:29.178
appreciate the irony.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.765
Thank you.

15:31.806 --> 15:35.560
Joey, here's $10

15:31.806 --> 15:35.560
for keeping your mouth shut.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.648
Buy yourself

15:38.271 --> 15:40.648
something nice.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.442
You knew he was

15:40.690 --> 15:42.442
a pool shark?

15:42.483 --> 15:45.361
Well, he did go to college

15:42.483 --> 15:45.361
on a billiards scholarship.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.406
Why didn't you

15:47.154 --> 15:48.406
say something?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.408
'Cause I just made ten bucks.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.120
Alright. You got to give me

15:52.201 --> 15:54.120
a chance to get me even, man.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.789
Alright, we'll play darts.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.750
Jess, for once in your life

15:55.830 --> 15:58.750
can't you just lose graciously?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.960
No. One dart.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.960
Double or nothing.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.255
Alright.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.260
- Twenty points.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.260
- Ha ha.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.596
Beat that,

16:09.302 --> 16:11.596
Minnesota Skinny.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.057
Okay.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.730
- Bull's-eye.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.730
- What?

16:20.772 --> 16:24.400
Sorry, Jess,

16:20.772 --> 16:24.400
I minored in darts.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.570
Hey, there's, uh,

16:24.442 --> 16:27.570
no rush to pay me.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.238
- I know where you live.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.238
- Oh, oh, hold it.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.615
You ain't going nowhere.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.615
Now I got to get even.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.575
We're going to triple

16:30.657 --> 16:32.575
or nothing. We'll..

16:32.617 --> 16:35.035
I know. Whoever spins around

16:32.617 --> 16:35.035
this chair the most times

16:35.077 --> 16:36.537
in ten seconds wins.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.539
Jess,

16:36.579 --> 16:38.539
this is pathetic.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.166
Shut up and time me.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.166
Go.

16:40.207 --> 16:45.129
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7--

16:45.171 --> 16:46.255
Time.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.340
Eight.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.008
Beat that.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.010
Jesse, are you so desperate

16:49.049 --> 16:51.010
to beat me in something

16:51.051 --> 16:53.847
you would lower yourself

16:51.051 --> 16:53.847
to spinning in a chair?

16:53.888 --> 16:55.264
I'm not doing this.

16:55.306 --> 16:58.392
Forfeit. I win. We're even.

16:55.306 --> 16:58.392
Joey, catch me.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.603
Okay, Michelle.

17:00.645 --> 17:04.190
Are you ready for

17:00.645 --> 17:04.190
the yummiest most delicious bowl

17:04.231 --> 17:07.610
of Rocky Road ice-cream

17:04.231 --> 17:07.610
you ever ate in your life.

17:07.652 --> 17:11.364
Rocky Road

17:07.652 --> 17:11.364
makes me crazy.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.657
Alright.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.951
Here comes the marshmallows,

17:12.699 --> 17:14.951
the almonds

17:14.993 --> 17:18.078
the chocolate chips, the..

17:18.120 --> 17:21.415
Oh, no! All the Rocky Road

17:18.120 --> 17:21.415
ice-cream is gone!

17:24.043 --> 17:25.670
All the ice-cream

17:24.043 --> 17:25.670
disappeared!

17:25.712 --> 17:29.590
Call the police.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.590
This is an emergency.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.679
What's so funny?

17:34.721 --> 17:37.015
Ha ha ha.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.726
I fooled you.

17:39.767 --> 17:46.106
The ice-cream is hidden

17:39.767 --> 17:46.106
right over here in this duck.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.486
That was

17:47.567 --> 17:50.486
a very mean trick.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.574
I'm sorry, but I had

17:51.821 --> 17:54.574
to teach you a lesson.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.660
Now, you'll never fool anyone

17:54.615 --> 17:57.660
again. Right, Michelle?

17:57.702 --> 18:01.288
Right.

17:57.702 --> 18:01.288
Now start scooping.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.623
Hi, girls.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.792
Uh, Danny, through

18:02.665 --> 18:04.792
playing pool?

18:04.834 --> 18:06.502
Yeah, Joey and Jesse

18:04.834 --> 18:06.502
are down there

18:06.544 --> 18:09.547
spinning in chairs

18:06.544 --> 18:09.547
for quarters.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.966
You know, I was, uh, kinda

18:09.589 --> 18:11.966
of tough on D.J. tonight.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.342
I think I better

18:12.008 --> 18:13.342
go talk to her.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.053
No. Don't.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.763
Bad idea.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.432
I mean, you know, kids that age,

18:16.804 --> 18:19.432
they'll just tune you right out.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.934
You'll talk and talk and talk

18:20.975 --> 18:24.437
and it'll be like

18:20.975 --> 18:24.437
she's not even there.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.814
Becky, do you know

18:24.478 --> 18:26.814
something I don't?

18:26.856 --> 18:28.357
Yes, I do.

18:28.399 --> 18:31.694
The gestation period

18:28.399 --> 18:31.694
of an elephant is 22 months.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.113
Actually,

18:31.736 --> 18:34.113
I-I knew that.

18:34.154 --> 18:37.951
Well, did you also know

18:34.154 --> 18:37.951
D.J.'s not upstairs?

18:37.992 --> 18:39.827
Now, that I didn't know.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.747
Did she go out with Kimmy

18:39.869 --> 18:42.747
after I told her not to?

18:42.789 --> 18:44.749
I'm sorry, Danny.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.834
I sort of told her she could.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.087
Becky, why would you do that?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.755
Well, I was just trying

18:49.128 --> 18:50.755
to be her friend.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.173
And she just needed

18:50.797 --> 18:53.173
ten minutes to talk to Ryan.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.718
And although that

18:53.215 --> 18:55.718
was half an hour ago.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.303
There goes D.J.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.388
D.J.'s outside?

19:00.431 --> 19:02.141
Where?

19:02.182 --> 19:05.853
Michelle, didn't you just

19:02.182 --> 19:05.853
learn not to make up stories?

19:05.895 --> 19:09.356
This time

19:05.895 --> 19:09.356
I made up the truth.

19:09.398 --> 19:13.152
Michelle, it's over.

19:09.398 --> 19:13.152
Give it up.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.488
There she

19:13.193 --> 19:15.488
goes again!

19:15.529 --> 19:17.615
That is D.J.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.283
I'm waiting.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.452
Okay. I'm sorry.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.288
I love to be right.

19:26.206 --> 19:29.669
I think I'm gonna go have that

19:26.206 --> 19:29.669
talk little with D.J. right now.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.591
Oh, hello, honey.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.217
Oh, hi, dad.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.261
I was just coming

19:37.259 --> 19:39.261
downstairs to study.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.930
The lighting's

19:39.303 --> 19:40.930
so much better.

19:40.972 --> 19:44.809
D.J., I know what

19:40.972 --> 19:44.809
you've been up to.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.227
Um, exactly how

19:44.851 --> 19:47.227
much do you know?

19:47.269 --> 19:51.941
Lying, sneaking out,

19:47.269 --> 19:51.941
meeting boys.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.652
Dad, where did we

19:51.983 --> 19:54.652
go wrong with her?

19:56.737 --> 19:58.823
I know, I know,

19:56.737 --> 19:58.823
I'm out of here.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.660
Aunt Becky, you told on me?

20:04.871 --> 20:08.582
Deej, why don't you go on up to

20:04.871 --> 20:08.582
your room and get comfortable?

20:08.624 --> 20:11.251
You're going

20:08.624 --> 20:11.251
to be there for a while.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.171
I thought

20:11.293 --> 20:13.171
you were my friend.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.297
Deej, wait.

20:15.339 --> 20:19.093
Danny, let me talk to her.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.345
Okay. But I'm next.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.223
Becky, uh, don't be

20:21.387 --> 20:24.223
so hard on yourself.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.558
When teenagers

20:24.264 --> 20:25.558
really want something

20:25.599 --> 20:28.602
they have a way

20:25.599 --> 20:28.602
of breaking us down.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.105
I'll get stronger, Danny.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.105
I promise.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.408
[knock on door]

20:42.449 --> 20:43.659
What?

20:45.536 --> 20:49.790
Deej...you

20:45.536 --> 20:49.790
and I need to talk.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.458
About what?

20:51.500 --> 20:55.129
About what happened.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.339
You know, Deej,

20:55.171 --> 20:57.339
you promised you'd come home

20:57.381 --> 20:59.217
in ten minutes

20:57.381 --> 20:59.217
and you didn't.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.053
Well, you promised that you

20:59.258 --> 21:02.053
wouldn't tell my dad.

21:02.095 --> 21:05.765
D.J., you took advantage

21:02.095 --> 21:05.765
of our friendship.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.600
I guess I did.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.476
But Ryan and I were

21:07.641 --> 21:09.476
really getting along.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.646
And I figured that

21:09.518 --> 21:12.646
you'd cover for me.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.567
Honey, I love you.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.153
And I love that we can

21:16.609 --> 21:19.153
spend time together

21:19.195 --> 21:20.988
and that we can share secrets

21:21.030 --> 21:22.573
but now that

21:21.030 --> 21:22.573
I'm living here

21:22.615 --> 21:25.284
I-I'm afraid there

21:22.615 --> 21:25.284
are times when I'm gonna have

21:25.325 --> 21:27.787
to be a responsible adult.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.957
It's a flaw in me

21:27.828 --> 21:30.957
you just gonna have to accept.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.333
Well, nobody's perfect.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.211
I'm really sorry,

21:33.375 --> 21:35.211
Aunt Becky.

21:35.253 --> 21:36.837
I'm sorry, too.

21:39.966 --> 21:43.052
Oh, I think I'd better go

21:39.966 --> 21:43.052
downstairs and apologize to dad.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.221
Oh, wait. One question.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.765
How did it go

21:45.263 --> 21:47.765
tonight with Ryan?

21:47.807 --> 21:50.350
Well, once Kimmy locked

21:47.807 --> 21:50.350
Bitterman in the closet

21:50.392 --> 21:53.229
it was smooth sailing.

21:53.271 --> 21:54.855
Did you get any studying done?

21:54.897 --> 21:56.649
Yeah, I studied--

21:56.690 --> 22:01.403
Studied his eyes, his hair,

21:56.690 --> 22:01.403
his cute little dimples.

22:01.445 --> 22:04.490
Too bad that stuff's

22:01.445 --> 22:04.490
not on the test.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.325
It is too bad.

22:06.366 --> 22:08.035
You're not going

22:06.366 --> 22:08.035
to do very well

22:08.077 --> 22:10.997
if you don't

22:08.077 --> 22:10.997
hit those books.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.625
[theme music]
