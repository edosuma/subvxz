WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.695
Ready, charlie?

00:03.729 --> 00:05.563
Let's show gabe
what you've learned.

00:05.598 --> 00:07.065
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:07.099 --> 00:09.167
- What's the opposite of up?
- Down.

00:09.201 --> 00:13.304
- Yeah.  What's
the opposite of big?
- Little.

00:13.339 --> 00:16.941
- What's the opposite
of good?
- Gabe.

00:19.612 --> 00:21.446
And here is your cookie.

00:22.781 --> 00:25.216
Teddy, you'll be
out of the house
in two years.

00:25.251 --> 00:27.886
Then it's just you and me.

00:29.688 --> 00:31.956
Thanks for
the ride home, fran.

00:31.991 --> 00:33.458
Should I pick you up
tomorrow?

00:33.492 --> 00:34.959
Nope, not working
tomorrow.

00:34.994 --> 00:37.295
Gotta get ready for
the big hospital benefit.

00:37.329 --> 00:41.599
You know me,
fran win-the-talent-show-
every-year culpepper.

00:41.634 --> 00:44.335
Mostly we just
call you fran...

00:44.370 --> 00:47.805
And some other things.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.708
This year I'll be
sharing the stage with
all the culpeppers.

00:50.743 --> 00:52.944
We're a wonderfully
talented family.

00:52.978 --> 00:57.282
And I assume your family
will be in the audience again?

00:57.316 --> 01:00.151
Actually, fran, my family
will also be performing.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.754
- We will?
- Yes, we will.

01:02.788 --> 01:05.990
Well, may the best
family win.

01:06.025 --> 01:09.193
That's our plan, fran.

01:10.863 --> 01:13.097
All right, duncans,
get your butts in here now!

01:13.132 --> 01:17.869
Oh, the sweet sound
of my lovely bride's voice.

01:17.903 --> 01:20.772
I have great news.

01:20.806 --> 01:23.374
The entire duncan family
is going to compete

01:23.409 --> 01:25.543
In this year's
hospital talent show.

01:25.578 --> 01:28.546
Cool.
What's the great news?

01:28.581 --> 01:32.350
Come on, you guys,
how can we lose?

01:32.384 --> 01:34.152
We have the world's
most perfect baby.

01:34.186 --> 01:37.855
I mean look at that face.
What happened to your face?

01:39.391 --> 01:40.959
I don't know, mom.

01:40.993 --> 01:43.928
I think I'm busy,
uh, whatever night
the stupid thing is.

01:43.963 --> 01:46.464
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh really, you guys
are too busy?

01:46.498 --> 01:48.533
Well, did I happen to mention
that the grand prize

01:48.567 --> 01:50.401
Is a two-day pass
to super adventure land?

01:50.436 --> 01:52.403
Super adventure land?

01:52.438 --> 01:54.906
- The funnest place on earth?
- Fran's going down.

01:54.940 --> 01:58.443
( all chanting )
fran's going down.

01:58.477 --> 02:00.778
Fran's going d--

02:00.813 --> 02:02.146
Forgot my keys.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.317
- You have a great
evening, fran.
- Okay.

02:08.787 --> 02:13.091
( chanting resumes )
fran's going down.

02:13.125 --> 02:14.892

03:10.049 --> 03:12.817
Thanks for walking me
to class, ray-ray.

03:12.851 --> 03:14.585
Anytime, I-I.

03:14.620 --> 03:18.056
Well, looks like you're
getting pretty cozy
with raymond.

03:18.090 --> 03:20.758
Ray-ray.
That's what I call him.

03:22.294 --> 03:24.729
I'm gonna stick
with raymond.

03:24.763 --> 03:27.465
Aw, look at those two.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.267
We could be double-dating
if you were still

03:29.301 --> 03:32.537
- Going out with spencer.
- Oh, you mean spence-spence?

03:34.973 --> 03:38.109
Hi, having a party tonight.
Hope you can make it.

03:38.143 --> 03:40.745
Hi, having a party tonight.
Hope you can make it.

03:40.779 --> 03:42.280
Hi--

03:42.314 --> 03:46.184
Hi, having a party tonight.
Hope you can make it.

03:46.218 --> 03:48.319
Something tells me

03:48.353 --> 03:50.688
Lynette doesn't want me
at her party.

03:50.723 --> 03:53.091
Well, if she doesn't
want my best friend,

03:53.125 --> 03:55.927
She's not getting me.

03:55.961 --> 03:57.462
Or me.

03:59.131 --> 04:01.399
That's kind of
where we started.

04:01.433 --> 04:04.001
<i>( bell rings )</i>

04:04.036 --> 04:07.271
Okay, class.

04:07.306 --> 04:12.677
This is a very exciting
time of year--

04:12.711 --> 04:15.012
Mock court.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.882
We're going to learn
how our justice system works

04:17.916 --> 04:21.786
By having our own trial
right here in class.

04:21.820 --> 04:25.823
- Teddy, you'll be
the prosecuting attorney.
- Yes!

04:25.858 --> 04:28.025
Somebody's going down.
Who's it gonna be?

04:28.060 --> 04:30.728
Lynette, you'll be
the defendant.

04:30.763 --> 04:33.097
And the system works.

04:33.132 --> 04:36.400
Spencer, you'll be
the defense lawyer.

04:36.435 --> 04:38.603
Walter, you'll be
the judge.

04:38.637 --> 04:43.074
Yes!  I can already
taste the power.

04:43.108 --> 04:46.911
That one might be
a mistake.

04:46.945 --> 04:50.882
Ivy, you'll be the witness
for the prosecution.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.251
And the rest of you

04:53.285 --> 04:55.887
Will make up the jury.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.222
If anyone needs me,
I'll be at my desk

04:58.257 --> 05:00.958
Finishing my sudoku.

05:03.996 --> 05:06.030
Hey, "counselor."

05:06.064 --> 05:08.132
I gotta warn you,
my dad's a lawyer,

05:08.167 --> 05:09.534
So I might have
an advantage.

05:09.568 --> 05:11.602
Oh yeah.
No, I'm not worried.

05:11.637 --> 05:13.871
- My dad's an exterminator.
- What does that mean?

05:13.906 --> 05:16.607
I'm gonna crush you
like a bug.

05:24.683 --> 05:26.951
- Hey, where'd you
get the dummy?
- I bought it online.

05:26.985 --> 05:31.422
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Ha ha ha ha.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.224
I'm gonna put him
in my car.

05:33.258 --> 05:34.992
That way I can use
the carpool lane

05:35.027 --> 05:36.961
When I'm making
kwikki chikki deliveries.

05:36.995 --> 05:38.462
<i>Huh?</i>

05:38.497 --> 05:40.631
So people can get their
crummy chicken quicker?

05:40.666 --> 05:43.935
Right.
Everybody wins.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.371
Well, except the people
who eat the chicken.

05:47.406 --> 05:50.675
And the chickens.

05:50.709 --> 05:53.511
I guess I'm the only one
who really wins.

05:53.545 --> 05:57.148
You know, I'm getting
an idea here.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.517
You bought
this piece of junk
online, right?

05:59.551 --> 06:00.785
Who are you talking to?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.791
I'm talking to you now.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.160
Oh, yeah yeah,
I bought him online.

06:09.194 --> 06:11.996
Well, maybe there's
people out there who
wanna buy our junk.

06:12.030 --> 06:13.998
Not following you.

06:15.601 --> 06:18.603
I'm saying if there's people
stupid enough to buy dummies,

06:18.637 --> 06:21.272
Maybe they're stupid enough
to buy our crummy stuff.

06:21.306 --> 06:23.875
- Still talking to me?
- Ugh.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.482
Now, miss wentz,
please tell the court
what happened next.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.685
- ( phone chimes )
- my ray-ray misses me with
seven exclamation points.

06:36.154 --> 06:38.756
- Ivy, focus.
- ( phone chimes )

06:38.790 --> 06:42.994
Mm, ray-ray says
I look hot today,

06:43.028 --> 06:45.129
But only with
six exclamation points.

06:45.163 --> 06:48.332
- Should I be worried?
- Moving on.  Okay.

06:48.367 --> 06:51.102
Now let's talk about
what you're going to
wear on the stand.

06:51.136 --> 06:52.870
You don't want
to be too flashy.

06:52.905 --> 06:55.239
T, you've seen
my closet.

06:55.274 --> 06:57.475
It's mostly zebra stripes
and leopard print.

06:57.509 --> 06:59.877
And those are
my church clothes.

06:59.912 --> 07:02.013
Okay, well,
then you're gonna
have to go through

07:02.047 --> 07:04.181
- Your mom's closet.
- What?

07:04.216 --> 07:06.183
You want me to wear
my mom's clothes to school?

07:06.218 --> 07:08.386
- Mm-hmm.
- In front of my boyfriend?

07:08.420 --> 07:11.756
I've had this dream.
It did not end well.

07:11.790 --> 07:14.191
Ivy, for one day
you can tone it down.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.893
Then you have the rest
of the school year

07:15.928 --> 07:18.095
To dress like the animal
of your choice.

07:19.364 --> 07:21.332
Oh, it's getting late.
I gotta go.

07:21.366 --> 07:23.968
It's my dad's birthday.

07:24.002 --> 07:25.736
Oh sorry, one more thing.

07:25.771 --> 07:28.372
When you're
on the stand tomorrow,
you have to be very serious.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.474
- It wouldn't hurt
to cry a little.
- Don't worry.

07:30.509 --> 07:32.610
If I'm wearing
my mom's clothes,
I'll be crying.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.785
Okay, this is our number
for the show.

07:40.819 --> 07:43.587
P.J., hit it.

07:43.622 --> 07:46.757
¶ we're the singin'
dancin' duncans ¶

07:46.792 --> 07:49.260
¶ quite a happy bunch ¶

07:49.294 --> 07:52.430
¶ we will always
work together ¶

07:52.464 --> 07:54.865
¶ breakfast,
din and lunch ¶

07:54.900 --> 07:57.702
<i>¶ you will always</i>
<i>see us smiling ¶</i>

07:57.736 --> 08:00.738
¶ evening, noon and morn ¶

08:00.772 --> 08:03.474
¶ we all start our day
the very same way ¶

08:03.508 --> 08:05.476
¶ when charlie
blows her horn. ¶

08:05.510 --> 08:09.113
And charlie blows her horn.
What do you think?

08:12.417 --> 08:15.286
It's a two-day pass
to super adventure land, right?

08:15.320 --> 08:19.223
- That is correct.
- ( all cheering )

08:19.257 --> 08:22.393
Okay, now I'm going
to show you the dance
that goes along with it.

08:22.427 --> 08:25.329
The first move--
very simple.

08:25.364 --> 08:28.399
I call it the chug,
kind of like what
a train does.

08:28.433 --> 08:31.068
A-one, two, three.
A-one, two, three.

08:31.103 --> 08:32.570
And a-one, two, three.

08:32.604 --> 08:34.105
Okay, you guys line up
and you do it.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.606
- Daddy in front.
- All right.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.775
- P.J., teddy, gabe.
- Okay.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.145
- I guess dad's the engine.
- I hope so.

08:41.179 --> 08:43.614
If he's the caboose,
this train's not
getting very far.

08:43.648 --> 08:47.218
- ( kids laugh )
- the engine has ears, guys...

08:47.252 --> 08:49.954
And feelings.

08:51.623 --> 08:53.357
Okay, ready?

08:53.392 --> 08:55.359
A-five, six,
seven, eight.

08:55.394 --> 08:58.429
And one, two, three.
And one, two, three.

08:58.463 --> 09:01.132
- And-- honey, you're not
moving your feet.
- Sorry.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.536
Okay, now you're not
moving your arms.

09:05.570 --> 09:07.538
Honey, this is hard.

09:07.572 --> 09:10.741
Dad, it's just
like patting your head
and rubbing your stomach.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.345
That must be really
depressing for you.

09:18.216 --> 09:20.851
Okay, let's assume
we got the train

09:20.886 --> 09:23.487
Into the station somehow.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.558
Okay, this next part
is a little tricky,

09:27.592 --> 09:29.326
So watch carefully.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.828
I'm gonna break it down.
Ready?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.496
Five, six, seven, eight.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.398
Touch, step,
pas de bourree.

09:34.433 --> 09:37.101
Kick, step, together,
front and passe.

09:37.135 --> 09:40.171
Turn, wait, ba-bam!

09:42.207 --> 09:44.809
Now we're gonna
sass it up a bit.

09:44.843 --> 09:47.044
A-shoulder shoulder,
tap tap.

09:47.079 --> 09:48.546
Turn around
and uh uh.

09:48.580 --> 09:51.048
And whammy, and whammy,
and whammy.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.084
Ah ooh ooh!

09:56.188 --> 09:58.989
Okay, now I want you to do
exactly what I just did.

09:59.024 --> 10:00.991
And a-five, six,
seven, eight.

10:01.026 --> 10:03.861
One, two--

10:03.895 --> 10:05.396
What are you waiting for?

10:07.065 --> 10:09.900
10 years
of dance lessons.

10:15.507 --> 10:17.408
I can't believe
how much money
we're making

10:17.442 --> 10:18.909
Selling our
old junk online.

10:18.944 --> 10:21.145
It's easier than taking
candy from a baby.

10:21.179 --> 10:22.646
I mean, I should know.

10:22.681 --> 10:25.182
I take candy from charlie
all the time.

10:30.055 --> 10:33.124
What's-- what's with
all the bubble wrap?

10:33.158 --> 10:37.294
Uh... Really fun to pop?

10:37.329 --> 10:39.630
( pops )

10:41.166 --> 10:43.167
<i>( popping continues )</i>

10:44.469 --> 10:46.904
Hey, anybody seen
my bowling ball?

10:46.938 --> 10:48.906
You loaned it
to mr. Dabney.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.808
I think I would have
remembered that.

10:50.842 --> 10:52.476
You're starting
to lose it, dad.

10:52.511 --> 10:54.445
I mean the next thing
you know,

10:54.479 --> 10:58.415
- You're not gonna remember
where your slippers are.
- Yeah.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.652
Come to think of it, where--
where are my slippers?

11:07.325 --> 11:08.792
Dude, we gotta be
more careful.

11:08.827 --> 11:10.995
Sooner or later,
dad's gonna know
he's missing stuff.

11:11.029 --> 11:12.796
- I wouldn't worry
about that.
- Why not?

11:12.831 --> 11:15.599
I just sold his glasses.

11:20.705 --> 11:23.641
Oh no, this is terrible.

11:23.675 --> 11:27.077
And there's nothing
we can do, you say?

11:27.112 --> 11:29.680
Thanks for calling, fran.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.184
Bob, I can't believe this.

11:33.218 --> 11:36.120
- The benefit's been canceled.
- What?

11:36.154 --> 11:40.558
- And after all that work
you and the kids did.
- Oh man.

11:40.592 --> 11:45.362
You know, I was getting
pretty good at that
turn, wait, bam!

11:46.965 --> 11:49.166
- Ba-bam.
- Ba-bam.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.635
Honey, could you
tell the kids?

11:51.670 --> 11:55.339
- I don't have the heart.
- Yeah, sure thing.

11:55.373 --> 11:58.509
I don't have the heart
to cook dinner either.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.844
No problem.
We go out.

12:00.879 --> 12:04.715
Okay, we go out.
You're so good.

12:04.749 --> 12:06.784
He bought that, right?

12:16.228 --> 12:18.229
Is this what you wanted?

12:18.263 --> 12:20.664
- Yeah, it's fine.
- It'd better be.

12:20.699 --> 12:24.101
A kid on the bus
called me ma'am.

12:24.135 --> 12:26.704
Hey, how come you didn't
text me back last night?

12:26.738 --> 12:29.039
Oh, my phone
must have been off.

12:29.074 --> 12:30.641
Right, yeah,
that's what I figured.

12:30.675 --> 12:32.576
- And so I called your house.
- You did?

12:32.611 --> 12:34.845
Yes yes, I did.
And you weren't there.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.715
- I wasn't?
- No no, you weren't.

12:37.749 --> 12:39.717
And so I wished your dad
a happy birthday

12:39.751 --> 12:42.052
And then he said,
"my birthday's not
for six months."

12:43.555 --> 12:45.689
Is this class
ever gonna start?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.493
- How are you doing, ivy?
- Hey, lynette.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.062
Ugh.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.567
Since when are you two
so friendly?

12:56.601 --> 12:59.737
What are you talking about?

12:59.771 --> 13:02.373
No.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.341
- No, you didn't.
- What?

13:04.376 --> 13:06.410
You went to lynette's party
last night.

13:06.444 --> 13:08.812
- Nuh-uh!
- Oh, don't you nuh-uh me.

13:08.847 --> 13:11.882
- I'll nuh-uh whoever
I want to nuh-uh.
- Nuh-uh!

13:13.418 --> 13:16.186
Okay, so if you weren't
at lynette's party last night,

13:16.221 --> 13:18.522
- Then where were you?
- That is none
of your business.

13:18.556 --> 13:21.225
No, see, it is my business
because you lied to me.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.627
- <i>( bell rings )</i>
- this is not over.

13:23.662 --> 13:25.763
Unbelievable.

13:25.797 --> 13:29.767
And they say government
is a boring class.

13:29.801 --> 13:31.468
They're right.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.327
Your witness, counselor.

13:41.462 --> 13:45.966
Miss wentz,
please tell us
in your own words

13:46.000 --> 13:49.069
What you observed
on the afternoon
of the 23rd.

13:49.103 --> 13:52.239
Well, I was working
at the bank,

13:52.273 --> 13:54.908
Teller window two,
when a lady approached

13:54.942 --> 13:57.277
And slipped me
a threatening note.

13:57.311 --> 14:01.148
Hmm.  And do you
see that person

14:01.182 --> 14:02.916
Here in this courtroom?

14:02.950 --> 14:06.119
Yeah.
She's right there.

14:07.989 --> 14:09.456
Hmm.

14:09.490 --> 14:13.560
And have you seen this person
anywhere else recently?

14:13.594 --> 14:15.395
Like at a party?

14:15.430 --> 14:17.764
A party I wasn't
invited to?

14:17.799 --> 14:19.833
Objection.
What does this have
to do with anything?

14:19.867 --> 14:21.835
I'll allow it

14:21.869 --> 14:24.371
Since I wasn't
invited either.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.007
Teddy:
<i>Now, miss wentz,</i>

14:27.041 --> 14:29.676
Did you or did you not
go to lynette's party?

14:29.710 --> 14:31.344
I don't want
to answer that.

14:31.379 --> 14:32.712
You have to.
You're under oath.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.215
No, I did not go
to the party.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.684
- Well, then where did you go?
- I was out...

14:37.718 --> 14:39.619
With spencer.

14:39.654 --> 14:42.889
- ( class murmuring )
- <i>( gavel pounds )</i>

14:42.924 --> 14:44.191
Order!

14:44.225 --> 14:47.060
Wait, so--

14:47.094 --> 14:49.796
- So you're dating spencer?
- I object!

14:49.831 --> 14:53.166
- I object.
- Now I object.

14:54.836 --> 14:57.170
I'm not dating him.

14:57.205 --> 14:59.673
I'm dating him.

14:59.707 --> 15:01.374
I withdraw my objection,

15:01.409 --> 15:03.743
- See you tonight, baby.
- You know it, ray-ray.

15:07.348 --> 15:09.816
Wait, so why were you out
with my ex-boyfriend?

15:09.851 --> 15:12.152
I was hanging out
with raymond.

15:12.186 --> 15:13.854
And he wanted to hang out
with spencer.

15:13.888 --> 15:15.922
I felt weird about it,
but I went along.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.325
And I didn't tell you because
I knew you wouldn't like it.

15:18.359 --> 15:20.460
Why wouldn't she like it?
You said we're friends, right?

15:20.495 --> 15:23.463
Oh please,
everyone says that
after they break up.

15:23.498 --> 15:27.334
- So we're not friends?
- No, of course we are.

15:27.368 --> 15:29.369
Okay, I'm confused.
Are we friends or not?

15:29.403 --> 15:32.372
If we are, then why
are you mad that I was
hanging out with ivy?

15:32.406 --> 15:34.975
No no, I'm not mad!

15:35.009 --> 15:37.544
Okay, I'm mad
because I--

15:37.578 --> 15:39.579
Well, because--

15:39.614 --> 15:43.016
Look, I'm not the one
on trial here.

15:43.050 --> 15:45.785
Let's take a recess.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.688
I lost the gavel
in my robe.

15:53.895 --> 15:56.129
<i>( video game</i>
<i>lasers shooting )</i>

15:56.163 --> 15:59.065
I just got a very interesting
phone call from fran culpepper.

15:59.100 --> 16:01.935
She wanted to make sure
your mom baked enough cookies

16:01.969 --> 16:03.803
For tonight's benefit.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.072
That is interesting.

16:06.107 --> 16:08.642
Why is that interesting?

16:08.676 --> 16:13.713
Because if the benefit
was really cancelled,
like your mom said,

16:13.748 --> 16:16.149
Why would fran culpepper
need cookies?

16:16.183 --> 16:20.086
Ah, I see where
you're going with this.

16:20.121 --> 16:22.822
Mom baked cookies
and she didn't tell us.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.763
Uh, going somewhere?

16:29.797 --> 16:33.300
Charlie can't sleep,
so I thought I'd take
her out for a drive.

16:33.334 --> 16:36.102
A little dolled up,
aren't we?

16:36.137 --> 16:38.505
Thank you.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.540
I always try
to look my best.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.052
( knocking )

16:52.086 --> 16:54.688
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.523
Can I come in?

16:56.557 --> 16:58.858
Whatever.

17:01.796 --> 17:03.930
I got you something.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.210
( small voice )
his name is berry sowwy.

17:19.380 --> 17:23.550
See, 'cause it's a strawberry

17:23.584 --> 17:25.585
And I'm sowwy...

17:27.154 --> 17:29.823
Berry sowwy.

17:32.026 --> 17:34.327
Wow, looks like
you felt real bad--

17:34.362 --> 17:36.863
Oh, 99¢ bad.

17:38.899 --> 17:42.035
( normal voice )
actually I found it
on the bus.

17:44.338 --> 17:47.674
- Do you forgive me?
- Well, I don't know.
I'm very mad at you.

17:47.708 --> 17:50.176
Well, stop being mad.
I don't like it.

17:51.979 --> 17:54.581
I know.
I don't like it either.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.916
I know I messed up.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.552
It's just I've never had
a boyfriend before.

17:59.587 --> 18:03.223
- I didn't know what to do.
- Look, ivy, there are
gonna be times

18:03.257 --> 18:05.325
When you have
a boyfriend
and I don't

18:05.359 --> 18:07.093
Or when I have
a boyfriend and
you don't.

18:07.128 --> 18:10.063
- I like it better
the first way.
- Okay.

18:10.097 --> 18:12.999
But the point is since
we're best friends forever,

18:13.034 --> 18:15.268
No matter what,
we have to be honest
with each other.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.904
You're so right.

18:17.938 --> 18:21.608
And from here on out,
I promise to always
be honest with you.

18:22.943 --> 18:26.146
- We good?
- Yeah, we're good.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.348
We're good.

18:28.382 --> 18:31.217
- Oh, so did we win the trial?
- What do you think?

18:31.252 --> 18:33.353
The prosecutor ran out
and the star witness

18:33.387 --> 18:36.356
Forgot everything
she was supposed to say.

18:36.390 --> 18:38.091
- We're a good team.
- Oh yeah.

18:38.125 --> 18:40.326
Oh yes.

18:43.798 --> 18:45.932

Hi, everybody.

18:52.239 --> 18:54.207
My name is amy duncan

18:54.241 --> 18:56.009
And I'd like
for you to meet

18:56.043 --> 18:58.244
The rest
of my wonderful family:

18:58.279 --> 19:00.914
My husband bob,

19:05.786 --> 19:07.921
My son p.J.,

19:11.425 --> 19:13.526
Our daughter teddy...

19:16.297 --> 19:19.299
Hey, did you forget
about me?

19:19.333 --> 19:21.501
Who could forget
about gabe?

19:21.535 --> 19:23.536
( tapping )

19:31.011 --> 19:35.348
And last, and certainly
the cutest, charlie!

19:40.621 --> 19:45.992
And together
we're the singin'
dancin' duncans!

19:46.026 --> 19:49.129
¶ we're the singin'

19:49.163 --> 19:51.598
¶ quite a happy bunch ¶

19:51.632 --> 19:55.335

20:02.042 --> 20:04.477
<i>¶ evening,</i>
<i>noon and morn... ¶</i>

20:09.850 --> 20:11.484
Hi, guys.

20:12.853 --> 20:16.055
Look, I know you're all
probably really mad at me.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.691
Oh, honey, we're not
mad anymore.

20:18.726 --> 20:20.193
You're not?

20:20.227 --> 20:22.495
Come on, we know
how you are.

20:22.530 --> 20:24.164
Everybody has flaws.

20:24.198 --> 20:26.232
I know.

20:26.267 --> 20:30.203
And mine is despite
all my wonderful talents

20:30.237 --> 20:33.573
I have yet
to be discovered.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.377
Well, I'm just so glad
you've all forgiven me.

20:37.411 --> 20:40.547
Yeah, of course.
And as far as the whole
fake-family thing goes,

20:40.581 --> 20:42.582
We've completely moved on.

20:43.951 --> 20:47.554
Fresh-baked cookies
made from scratch.

20:47.588 --> 20:49.823
- Who's this?
- Our new mom.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.494
Okay, you got me.

20:54.528 --> 20:56.162
Fake mom,
you can go home now.

20:56.197 --> 20:58.865
No way!
We love fake mom.

20:58.899 --> 21:01.501
- She cooks.  She cleans.
- She even changes diapers.

21:01.535 --> 21:03.937
Diapers?
Really?

21:05.105 --> 21:08.908
Ha, welcome to the family.

21:14.248 --> 21:17.650
Well, charlie, if there's
one thing your big sis
wants you to know,

21:17.685 --> 21:20.220
It's that it's important
to always tell the truth.

21:20.254 --> 21:22.655
That's right,
honesty is always
the best policy.

21:22.690 --> 21:24.924
- True dat.  Yep.
- Uh, guys?

21:24.959 --> 21:28.328
- Gabe: <i>Yep?</i>
- Where's the dryer?

21:29.930 --> 21:33.366
- I told you they'd notice.
- Just keep walking.

21:36.103 --> 21:41.107
- Hey, dad, are they
in trouble?
- Oh yeah.

21:41.141 --> 21:44.444
Your brothers are gonna need
some good luck, charlie.

21:46.247 --> 21:48.248
True dat.

21:51.769 --> 21:55.339
Your honor, this woman
replaced her family

21:55.373 --> 21:58.976
Just because
they have no rhythm.

21:59.010 --> 22:00.978
Now given the horrible
nature of this crime,

22:01.012 --> 22:02.646
I request the maximum
punishment.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.014
And so do I.

22:04.048 --> 22:06.249
What are you doing?
You're my attorney.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.951
Do you remember that time
you made me eat

22:07.986 --> 22:09.453
All my broccoli?

22:09.487 --> 22:12.990
Who's laughing now?
Huh.

22:14.392 --> 22:16.259
Your honor, we are ready
for the verdict.

22:16.294 --> 22:17.961
How do you find
the defendant?

22:21.632 --> 22:23.734
Guilty, mommy!
