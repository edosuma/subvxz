00:00.040 --> 00:03.030
Previously onHawaii Five-O:
Your half-sister’s daddy issues

00:03.030 --> 00:04.890
turned her into
a stone-cold psycho,

00:04.990 --> 00:07.990
and now anyone connected to you
is in her crosshairs.

00:07.990 --> 00:09.410
ADAM: How do you know
where my wife is?

00:09.410 --> 00:11.700
You have six hours
to get me the money.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.990
If I were you, I wouldn’t
waste any more time

00:13.990 --> 00:14.990
standing here lying to me.

00:14.990 --> 00:17.160
I assume you have a plan?
I go get the money.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.250
People I care about
are in danger,

00:19.250 --> 00:20.910
and I have no other options.

00:20.910 --> 00:22.040
I need to make a withdrawal.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.790
The money’s being arranged.

00:23.790 --> 00:24.870
What the hell is this place?

00:24.870 --> 00:28.120
It’s sort of an unofficial bank
for the Yakuza.

00:28.660 --> 00:31.990
ADAM: Trust me, Jessie.
Turn the car around.
I’m getting out.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.990
But if you run,
she will find you.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.200
Money’s gone.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.620
Jessie.

00:50.790 --> 00:54.000
I told her I’d protect her,
Steve.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.990
All right, Jessie made a
choice to steal that money.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.830
That choice got her killed.

00:57.830 --> 01:00.660
There’s nothing you could
have done about it, Adam.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.990
Any update on Noriko?

01:06.990 --> 01:10.990
We have every law enforcement
agency on high alert.

01:10.990 --> 01:13.040
But still no leads.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.950
No, not yet.
And you know what?

01:14.950 --> 01:16.790
Maybe she’s on the island
still, laying low.

01:16.790 --> 01:17.990
She could be on the other
side of the planet.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.500
Frankly, it doesn’t matter.
I don’t care where she’s hiding.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.040
We’re gonna find her.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.790
Maybe.

01:25.540 --> 01:28.990
But you’ll have to do it
without me.

01:30.410 --> 01:32.200
What?

01:33.870 --> 01:36.200
I’m done, Steve.

01:37.950 --> 01:39.870
I’m out.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.700
Where is he?

02:01.490 --> 02:03.450
What?

02:11.540 --> 02:14.830
He went into cardiac arrest
about 20 minutes ago.

02:14.830 --> 02:19.620
He was dead before we
could even get him uncuffed.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.160
When he was captured
this morning,

02:22.160 --> 02:23.580
he was said to be

02:23.580 --> 02:25.410
in good health.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.540
This abuse looks recent.

02:30.830 --> 02:32.040
Look, Catherine...

02:32.040 --> 02:32.660
You!

02:32.660 --> 02:35.120
Rollins!
Do you realize
what you’ve done?

02:35.120 --> 02:37.490
Do you realize
what you have done?

02:37.490 --> 02:39.370
Rollins, that’s enough.
Huh?!

02:39.370 --> 02:40.830
Do you?

02:40.830 --> 02:41.910
Rollins!

02:45.330 --> 02:49.200
I want to see everything
Masari had on him now!

03:02.290 --> 03:07.200
That’s probably some kind
of Sunni good-luck piece.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.200
It’s Hawaiian.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.490
It appears to be King
Kamehameha’s Lei Niho Palaoa.

03:11.490 --> 03:13.790
All the Hawaiian chiefs
wore one.

03:13.790 --> 03:16.540
You said the man who had it
is now dead?

03:16.540 --> 03:17.330
Uh, yeah.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.290
Which is why I need to know

03:18.290 --> 03:19.830
how he could’ve gotten
something like this.

03:19.830 --> 03:22.000
Because it could tell me
where he’s been.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.370
If that necklace
is what I think,

03:23.370 --> 03:24.790
then it’s supposed
to be entombed

03:24.790 --> 03:27.200
with King Kamehameha himself.

03:27.410 --> 03:31.500
Wait. Are you saying that
the king was buried with this?

03:31.500 --> 03:34.200
Wait. What’s going on?

03:34.700 --> 03:36.490
The location
of King Kamehameha’s grave

03:36.490 --> 03:39.620
has been a secret
for almost 200 years.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.580
No one knows where it is.

03:41.580 --> 03:45.160
She’s right. All we know
is that he’s buried in Hawaii.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.250
I gotta get to Hawaii.

03:46.250 --> 03:50.160
If Masari was there,
I gotta find out why.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.490
Could possibly
lead me to Asad.

03:52.490 --> 03:53.490
Are you serious?

03:53.490 --> 03:55.700
This is hardly
a lead, Rollins.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.490
Yeah, I know.

03:56.490 --> 04:00.200
But look, it’s all I got
to go on, so...

04:01.910 --> 04:04.490
You plan on doing this alone?

04:06.450 --> 04:07.660
No.

04:07.660 --> 04:10.490
I got someone there
who can help me.

04:10.490 --> 04:14.500
(Hawaii Five-O
theme song plays)

04:44.330 --> 04:45.160
Hi.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.540
Oh, this is a surprise.

04:46.540 --> 04:47.910
Yes, I find the element
of surprise

04:47.910 --> 04:50.160
to be a key part
of the unannounced drop-in.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.080
So, I come bearing gifts.

04:52.370 --> 04:54.750
All right. Thank you.

04:54.750 --> 04:55.950
TANI:
Oh, Eddie, don’t worry.

04:55.950 --> 04:59.200
Of course I didn’t forget
about you.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.500
Go on, sit down,
sit down, sit down.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.870
What do I have for you, hmm?

05:02.870 --> 05:05.250
What do I have for you?
Oh, what’s this?

05:05.250 --> 05:06.540
You got any goodies for me?

05:06.540 --> 05:09.450
Do I have any goodies for you?
Huh, let’s see.

05:09.450 --> 05:11.660
What do I have?
I got, um...

05:12.330 --> 05:13.830
I got a woof cream pie.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.490
I got a snicker-poodle.

05:15.490 --> 05:17.700
You know, I’ve actually had one
of those snicker-poodle things.

05:17.700 --> 05:20.700
Oh, have you?
Yeah, they ain’t bad.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.540
Here, help yourself.
Oh, you...

05:22.540 --> 05:25.200
Yeah, I mean,
you like them, right?
Yeah.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.500
All right.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.000
Good.

05:29.490 --> 05:30.700
It’s got the, um...

05:30.700 --> 05:33.540
you know, it’s got the
crunchiness of a human cookie.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.000
It’s good, huh?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.490
It is so good.

05:36.490 --> 05:39.490
Can you just, uh...
give me the bag, please?

05:39.490 --> 05:40.500
Oh, no.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.200
That’s foul.
That’s nice.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.830
That joke went sideways
real fast.

05:43.830 --> 05:45.250
That was terrible.

05:45.250 --> 05:45.790
Yeah. Anyway...

05:45.790 --> 05:49.490
um, I-I see you’re not dressed
for your dad’s birthday lunch.

05:49.490 --> 05:53.370
Um... yeah, there’s
a change of plans.

05:53.370 --> 05:55.080
So you’re not gonna go?

05:55.080 --> 05:59.500
It was always gonna be a
last-minute-decision type thing.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.000
Right, I mean, that’s actually

06:01.000 --> 06:02.620
why I came over here
this morning.

06:02.620 --> 06:03.830
You know, I figured you could

06:03.830 --> 06:06.370
use a pep talk
before you went over.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.370
You hear that, boy?

06:08.370 --> 06:09.750
You were an
afterthought.

06:09.750 --> 06:13.870
No, he’s not.
Don’t say that to him.

06:13.870 --> 06:15.750
Seriously, um...

06:15.750 --> 06:19.950
I-I know things are-are rough
between you and your dad.

06:21.160 --> 06:24.580
But I just figure, you know,
it’s his birthday, so...

06:24.580 --> 06:26.580
might as well just make
an appearance.

06:26.580 --> 06:29.790
Yeah. I just think it’s better
for everybody

06:29.790 --> 06:33.490
if me and my dad
weren’t in the same room.

06:34.250 --> 06:36.500
Right. Yeah.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.910
Well, just think about it.

06:37.910 --> 06:41.120
Sure. Me and Eddie
are gonna go for a run,

06:41.120 --> 06:42.620
so I’ll think about it.

06:42.620 --> 06:44.290
Okay?
Okay.

06:44.290 --> 06:46.490
All right. Come on, boy.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.490
You want him to go

06:47.490 --> 06:50.160
anywhere with you,
you better take these.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.700
All right.

06:52.410 --> 06:53.450
CATHERINE:For the past...

06:53.450 --> 06:56.830
six months now,
I’ve been chasing this man.

06:56.830 --> 06:58.490
Asad Al-Laja.

06:58.490 --> 07:01.330
Now, he’s the chief bomb maker
for a Somali terror cell,

07:01.330 --> 07:03.490
so obviously a very
high-value target.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.580
We’ve also got chatter
that he was here on a mission

07:06.580 --> 07:07.540
getting supplies for Asad

07:07.540 --> 07:10.450
and that he may have had
other people with him.

07:10.450 --> 07:11.910
Are you guys okay?

07:11.910 --> 07:13.290
Huh?

07:13.290 --> 07:14.000
Yeah. Why?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Because you’re being weird.
Weird?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.330
Nobody’s being weird.

07:17.330 --> 07:19.830
Girl, you trippin’.
STEVE: No, we’re, uh...

07:19.830 --> 07:20.700
we’re fine.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.580
What supplies do you think
Masari’s here to get?

07:23.580 --> 07:24.580
We’re not sure, but...

07:24.580 --> 07:28.120
I’ve got a theory that he was
after some depleted uranium.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.410
GROVER:
What makes you
think that?

07:30.410 --> 07:31.250
Because the necklace

07:31.250 --> 07:32.750
that was found
in Masari’s possession

07:32.750 --> 07:35.910
had trace amounts
of U-236 and plutonium.

07:35.910 --> 07:37.830
Both of which are found in DU.

07:37.830 --> 07:39.950
And since there are several
military bases

07:39.950 --> 07:41.490
in Hawaii that
have been known

07:41.490 --> 07:42.830
to have depleted
uranium on site...

07:42.830 --> 07:43.950
You’re thinking
he came out here

07:43.950 --> 07:46.120
and got his hands
on some of those munitions.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.490
CATHERINE:
So, if we can pinpoint

07:47.490 --> 07:49.000
exactly which
stash he hit,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.160
then I can start
retracing his steps,

07:51.160 --> 07:53.160
which could
lead me to Asad.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.250
Okay, Catherine,

07:54.250 --> 07:56.500
I gotta ask you
a question: Why Five

07:56.500 --> 07:57.950
Yeah.
I mean, you have

07:57.950 --> 08:00.370
unlimited amounts
of CIA assets

08:00.370 --> 08:03.250
at your disposal, right?
Yeah.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.200
I do.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.450
But, Steve, this
is your island.

08:06.450 --> 08:08.490
Okay, no one knows it
better than you do.

08:08.490 --> 08:11.910
And I figured, if there are
terrorists operating on it,

08:11.910 --> 08:14.490
then you’d want the op.

08:14.490 --> 08:16.330
Besides, I, uh...

08:16.330 --> 08:19.700
thought it’d be
nice to catch up.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.660
Yeah.

09:29.950 --> 09:32.910
Eddie, where you going? Eddie!

09:32.910 --> 09:34.490
Eddie.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.700
Hey, buddy, where you at?

09:38.910 --> 09:40.790
Eddie.

09:41.490 --> 09:43.750
Eddie, where are you?

09:44.660 --> 09:46.370
Eddie!

10:19.850 --> 10:21.600
Help!

10:23.350 --> 10:25.890
Is anyone up there?

10:26.690 --> 10:28.890
Help!

10:29.600 --> 10:32.150
Is anybody up there?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.310
Help!

Somebody!

Eddie!

10:47.480 --> 10:49.020
Hey!

10:49.890 --> 10:51.850
No, no, no, no.
Go back!

10:51.850 --> 10:52.980
Get back!

10:55.850 --> 10:56.940
Get back, Eddie!

11:06.690 --> 11:08.350
Hello?

11:08.350 --> 11:11.900
Someone. Anyone.

11:22.190 --> 11:24.940
Hey.

11:24.940 --> 11:26.850
How you doing

11:26.850 --> 11:30.060
Yeah, I’m... I’m all right.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.350
Listen, um...

11:34.350 --> 11:37.020
I heard that you’re quitting
the task force,

11:37.020 --> 11:38.940
that you’re going
to the mainland.

11:38.940 --> 11:39.890
That’s great.

11:39.890 --> 11:41.980
I think you and Kono
should be together.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.890
I’m happy for you.

11:43.890 --> 11:45.270
Thanks.

11:45.270 --> 11:45.850
But, Adam,

11:45.850 --> 11:48.770
don’t you think you should stay
and work the case?

11:48.770 --> 11:50.690
Don’t you want to see Noriko
put behind bars?

11:50.690 --> 11:53.350
You’re so close, Adam.
As far as I’m concerned,

11:53.350 --> 11:55.980
prison would be
letting her off easy.

11:55.980 --> 11:58.060
She deserves worse.

11:58.060 --> 12:00.150
A lot worse.

12:00.150 --> 12:03.190
So, given how I’m feeling,

12:03.190 --> 12:07.020
maybe I’m not the best person
to go after her.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.440
Maybe not.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.480
I’ll catch up with you later.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.560
Yeah.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.440
Thank you.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.270
Okay.

12:19.270 --> 12:21.310
I checked with all
our local bases.

12:21.310 --> 12:25.230
But as I suspected,
all depleted uranium munitions

12:25.230 --> 12:26.890
are accounted for.

12:26.890 --> 12:28.150
Are you sure?

12:28.150 --> 12:29.060
Okay, ’cause we believe

12:29.060 --> 12:31.730
that Masari acquired DU
while he was here.

12:31.730 --> 12:34.770
Are you certain that all
of these records are up to date?

12:34.770 --> 12:37.810
The military takes
depleted uranium very seriously.

12:37.810 --> 12:40.400
Well, wait a minute.
These are all from active bases.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.770
What about the ones
that have been shut down?

12:42.770 --> 12:44.400
You mean the one on Kaho’olawe?

12:44.400 --> 12:45.770
Yeah.
We haven’t had

12:45.770 --> 12:47.850
a presence on that island
in about 30 years.

12:47.850 --> 12:48.890
STEVE:
Yeah, I know that, but...

12:48.890 --> 12:51.520
when the Navy abandoned
Kaho’olawe in the early ’90s,

12:51.520 --> 12:54.020
it’s possible we left some
DU munitions behind, right?

12:54.020 --> 12:55.890
CATHERINE:
Yeah, no, he’s right.

12:55.890 --> 12:56.940
I mean, for years,

12:56.940 --> 12:58.150
people considered
depleted uranium

12:58.150 --> 13:00.020
as just waste product
and stored it away.

13:00.020 --> 13:04.350
I mean, that could have been
the case for Kaho’olawe.

13:04.810 --> 13:08.810
Even if there were records
of munitions on that island,

13:08.810 --> 13:11.890
they’re probably
long gone now.

13:12.890 --> 13:15.890
Okay, so I’ve pulled some maps
of Kaho’olawe

13:15.890 --> 13:16.890
dating back to the ’40s.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.310
What exactly
am I looking for here?

13:18.310 --> 13:19.520
STEVE:
Anything that could house

13:19.520 --> 13:21.060
depleted uranium--
like a munitions shed

13:21.060 --> 13:23.060
or a storage depot or something.

13:23.890 --> 13:24.600
Okay.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.980
I’m seeing some barracks
down by the bay.

13:27.980 --> 13:29.520
I don’t know.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.350
Wait. Okay, this is interesting.

13:31.350 --> 13:32.770
So, I got two maps
decades apart.

13:32.770 --> 13:36.400
The earlier map, I’m seeing
an underground storage bunker

13:36.400 --> 13:37.270
on the east side of the island.

13:37.270 --> 13:39.890
And on the newer one,
the bunker’s totally gone.

13:39.890 --> 13:41.690
Okay, well,
that could just mean

13:41.690 --> 13:43.350
the military stopped using it.

13:43.350 --> 13:45.230
It could also mean
it’s still there.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.150
And it’s not
uncommon to seal up

13:47.150 --> 13:50.230
a decommissioned bunker with
munitions still inside of it.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.890
Check it out.
If your boy, Masari,

13:51.890 --> 13:53.060
went out there,
did some excavating

13:53.060 --> 13:55.650
and found that bunker,
he could’ve helped himself to

13:55.650 --> 13:56.890
the depleted uranium
that was still inside.

13:56.890 --> 13:59.650
Come to think of it, if he was
digging in multiple spots,

13:59.650 --> 14:01.190
that’s how he could’ve
come across

14:01.190 --> 14:02.650
Kamehameha’s site.
All right.

14:02.650 --> 14:04.020
We gotta get over to Kaho’olawe

14:04.020 --> 14:05.730
and see if we can find
that bunker.

14:05.730 --> 14:08.020
Hopefully Masari
left some clues behind.

14:08.020 --> 14:10.020
Thanks, Tani.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.190
Hey, Kamekona.

14:24.190 --> 14:25.850
What are you doing?

14:25.850 --> 14:27.650
You ever rented a car before?

14:27.650 --> 14:29.480
You know how they
note the condition

14:29.480 --> 14:30.890
when you leave with it?

14:30.890 --> 14:32.190
That’s what I’m doing here.

14:32.190 --> 14:35.940
That way, if this baby
has any new scratches,

14:35.940 --> 14:38.560
we both know who’s at fault.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.890
You serious?

14:39.890 --> 14:41.890
Would you like
to prepay for the fuel

14:41.890 --> 14:44.150
or bring it back
with a full tank?

14:44.150 --> 14:45.270
Kamekona...

14:46.890 --> 14:49.940
Wait! Hold up! Wait!

14:54.440 --> 14:55.890
Hey, Jerry.

14:55.890 --> 14:58.520
Little bird told me
that you may have a line

14:58.520 --> 15:01.560
on the mother
of all archaeological digs.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.350
If so, I want in.
Jerry, uh, listen.

15:03.350 --> 15:04.560
I’m not sure
what Tani told you,

15:04.560 --> 15:07.810
but this is not an
archaeological expedition, okay?

15:07.810 --> 15:08.890
Well it should be.

15:08.890 --> 15:10.060
I have dreamed
of finding

15:10.060 --> 15:11.440
King Kamehameha’s
final resting place

15:11.440 --> 15:13.890
ever since I was a little kid
digging up rocks

15:13.890 --> 15:16.310
in my parents’ backyard.
Not only that--

15:16.310 --> 15:19.690
I have said for years
that the tomb was on Kaho’olawe.

15:19.690 --> 15:22.560
See, other so-called
experts have posited

15:22.560 --> 15:24.400
that it was in Moku’ula
or Iao Valley,

15:24.400 --> 15:28.890
but I have long said
the location was on Kaho’olawe,

15:28.890 --> 15:31.690
and I have the evidence
to prove it.

15:31.690 --> 15:32.400
Okay, Jerry,

15:32.400 --> 15:34.890
uh... love this
enthusiasm, buddy,

15:34.890 --> 15:38.020
but again-- not an
archaeological expedition, okay?

15:38.020 --> 15:39.600
Look, Jerry, he’s right.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.480
We’re looking for evidence

15:40.480 --> 15:42.890
that could hopefully
lead us to a terrorist.

15:42.890 --> 15:43.890
Yes, I totally
get that.

15:43.890 --> 15:47.940
However, if the king’s
burial site is on Kaho’olawe,

15:47.940 --> 15:48.980
someone should go there
to confirm it.

15:48.980 --> 15:51.890
I mean, we’re talking
about our heritage here.
STEVE: Yes, we are,

15:51.890 --> 15:54.520
and that’s important, Jerry.
Let me ask you something.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.520
Have either of you
ever been to Kaho’olawe?

15:59.020 --> 16:00.890
I have not. No.
Well, I have.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.890
My uncle took me hunting
there growing up.

16:02.890 --> 16:05.020
I know the place like
the back of my hand.

16:05.020 --> 16:07.890
You could use
my expertise.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.270
He does have a point there.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.980
Having a guide
couldn’t hurt us.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.940
Okay. All right.

16:16.940 --> 16:18.730
Hop in.

16:21.890 --> 16:24.190
Have a nice day.

16:38.890 --> 16:40.850
So, what’d you guys hunt?

16:40.850 --> 16:41.890
JERRY:
Huh?

16:41.890 --> 16:43.890
You and your uncle--
what’d you hunt?

16:43.890 --> 16:46.650
Oh. Feral cats, mainly.

16:47.020 --> 16:49.190
Did you say feral cats?
Yep.

16:49.190 --> 16:49.890
Felis catus.

16:49.890 --> 16:52.310
After the Navy turned this rock
over to the state,

16:52.310 --> 16:54.850
all the invasive ungulates
were cleared out.

16:54.850 --> 16:56.480
You know, cows, goats, sheep.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.020
But that pesky feral cat
population was harder to evict.

16:59.020 --> 17:02.350
And we all know the danger
those little buggers pose

17:02.350 --> 17:03.940
to Hawaii’s fragile ecosystem,

17:03.940 --> 17:05.890
so my uncle and I
decided to tool up

17:05.890 --> 17:08.310
and do our part
to try to neutralize ’em.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.600
Of course, our trips
were fraught with danger.

17:10.600 --> 17:14.270
This rock is crawling
with alien-wasp swarms

17:14.270 --> 17:15.690
and black widow spiders.

17:15.690 --> 17:18.810
Also the brown tree snake.
CATHERINE: And...

17:18.810 --> 17:20.900
this.

17:21.770 --> 17:22.890
Oh, boy.

17:22.890 --> 17:24.730
STEVE:
Hey.

17:24.730 --> 17:26.810
Jerry, you all right?

17:26.810 --> 17:28.230
What? Yeah.

17:28.230 --> 17:28.940
Why?

17:28.940 --> 17:30.890
Because you’re white as a ghost.

17:30.890 --> 17:31.810
I am?

17:31.810 --> 17:33.690
Must be my sunscreen.

17:33.690 --> 17:34.890
Jerry, if you’ve
been here before,

17:34.890 --> 17:36.400
you had to have
known there was

17:36.400 --> 17:38.150
unexploded ordnance
on this island.

17:38.150 --> 17:38.690
Yeah.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.600
Totally.
I just... you know, forgot.

17:41.600 --> 17:42.890
Jerry,

17:42.890 --> 17:44.890
you’ve never been here
before, have you?

17:44.890 --> 17:47.890
What are you talking about?
Of course I have.

17:48.690 --> 17:49.190
Jerry.

17:49.190 --> 17:51.890
All right, it’s
my first time.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.850
And I’m guessing, um,
you’ve actually

17:55.850 --> 17:57.400
never been hunting, either.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.100
Definitely not.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.100
My uncle and I would
play Super Nintendo.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.230
I could never hurt
another living creature.

18:02.230 --> 18:03.850
Jerry, you lied to us.
But not about

18:03.850 --> 18:05.230
the cultural significance
of what might be here.

18:05.230 --> 18:07.890
A discovery of this magnitude?
I’m sorry, I wasn’t gonna

18:07.890 --> 18:09.650
pass up the chance
to be here for that.

18:09.650 --> 18:10.310
All right, whatever.

18:10.310 --> 18:12.690
We’ll talk about this
later, all right?

18:12.690 --> 18:15.600
We need to keep moving.
Whoa, what about this?

18:16.890 --> 18:17.900
Watch your step.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.190
You’ll be fine.

18:22.230 --> 18:24.520
CATHERINE:
You coming?

18:24.520 --> 18:25.440
Uh...

18:25.440 --> 18:27.890
you guys go ahead.
I’ll catch up.

19:03.890 --> 19:05.350
All right, sailor.
Your turn.

19:05.350 --> 19:08.890
Just stay away from that,
uh, yellow-greenish stuff there.

19:08.890 --> 19:10.270
Oh, thank you, thank you.

19:10.270 --> 19:11.020
Happy to help.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.890
Not my first jungle, young lady.

19:14.810 --> 19:16.770
All right.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.480
There you go.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.520
So, uh... Tani, is it?

19:22.520 --> 19:23.520
Yeah.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.400
She seems great.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.100
Yeah, she’s great.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.890
Yeah, she’s, like, uh,
really on top of things.

19:27.890 --> 19:29.310
Yeah, she’s good.

19:29.310 --> 19:31.850
Nice. I’m sure it’s just
a matter of time

19:31.850 --> 19:33.810
before she picks up
all your bad habits.

19:33.810 --> 19:36.940
Oh, believe me,
she’s already there.

19:37.940 --> 19:41.310
You know, she actually
reminds me a lot of you.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.810
How so?
Well...

19:42.810 --> 19:45.890
she’s an Army brat.

19:45.890 --> 19:47.890
You’re a Navy brat.

19:47.890 --> 19:49.310
You’re both good at your jobs.

19:49.310 --> 19:51.190
You both got good hearts.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.890
Thanks.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.890
So, uh...

19:56.650 --> 19:59.520
...how’s it going with, uh...

19:59.520 --> 20:01.150
Lynn?

20:02.560 --> 20:04.600
It’s good.
Yeah?

20:04.600 --> 20:05.690
Yeah.

20:05.690 --> 20:06.230
Good.

20:06.230 --> 20:09.890
Just keeping it casual
for now, you know?

20:09.890 --> 20:12.440
What about you?
You been seeing anybody?

20:12.440 --> 20:16.520
Oh, you mean besides assets
and enemy combatants?

20:16.520 --> 20:17.270
Yeah.

20:17.270 --> 20:20.690
Uh, it’s kind of hard
to keep a relationship going

20:20.690 --> 20:21.890
when you do what I do.

20:21.890 --> 20:24.520
Yeah, I bet.
But, um...

20:24.520 --> 20:26.560
I am dating a little bit.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.480
Yeah?
Yeah.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.440
That’s great news.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.770
Thanks. Yeah.
That’s good.

20:30.770 --> 20:33.100
Isn’t it great that we
can talk to each other

20:33.100 --> 20:34.310
about this stuff now?
It really is.

20:34.310 --> 20:36.890
Yeah.
Look how mature
we are right now.

20:36.890 --> 20:37.520
So mature.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.440
Up high. Come on.
Maturity.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.850
To maturity.

20:40.850 --> 20:42.560
It’s not all that
surprising, really,

20:42.560 --> 20:44.100
if you think about it,
because...

20:44.100 --> 20:46.520
we were really good friends
before we got involved.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.190
Yeah, we were.
Yeah.

20:47.190 --> 20:48.890
I mean, sometimes
I think it ruined us.

20:48.890 --> 20:49.940
Well, we probably
shouldn’t

20:49.940 --> 20:51.190
have slept together,
but, you know...

20:51.190 --> 20:53.440
Oh, God, huge mistake
for the friendship.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.890
Yeah.
I mean, not that it wasn’t
awesome or anything.

20:56.890 --> 20:57.890
I’m just saying,

20:57.890 --> 20:59.810
probably not
the best decision to do

20:59.810 --> 21:02.440
for, you know,
the friendship...

21:03.480 --> 21:04.810
Cath! Catherine!

21:04.810 --> 21:06.020
Catherine.

21:06.020 --> 21:09.060
Hey, you okay?

21:10.020 --> 21:11.020
Yeah.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.310
Yeah, yeah, I’m okay.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.440
Oh, that’s not good.
Hey.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.650
Just hold on.
I’m gonna get you out of there.

21:19.650 --> 21:21.100
Okay?
Okay.

21:21.100 --> 21:23.400
MAN: Hey!

21:23.400 --> 21:24.270
No, you won’t.

21:24.270 --> 21:26.900
You’re not going
anywhere.

21:29.060 --> 21:31.000
Weapons on the ground now.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.380
You, too.
Throw your gun up here.

21:34.990 --> 21:36.830
My name is
Commander Steve McGarrett.

21:36.830 --> 21:38.290
All right?
I’m with the Five-O Task Force.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.870
You understand me?
Take it easy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:40.870 --> 21:41.830
Take it easy, all right?

of trouble already.

You understand me? This island

21:53.620 --> 21:54.620
You shouldn’t even be here.

21:54.620 --> 21:56.620
Now, don’t make it worse
for yourselves.

21:56.620 --> 21:58.580
Trust me.

21:58.990 --> 22:00.040

22:00.040 --> 22:01.120

22:18.370 --> 22:21.910

to pull yourself out

22:45.120 --> 22:45.830

Yeah.

22:54.990 --> 22:57.000
Okay.

Okay.

All right.

Can I ask you a question?

23:22.870 --> 23:23.990
Now?
Yes, now.

23:23.990 --> 23:25.200
What?
Were you really

23:25.200 --> 23:26.620
gonna propose, or did you just

23:26.620 --> 23:28.660
buy that ring
in the event that you

23:28.660 --> 23:29.990
decided you were
gonna propose?

Yes, yes, yes.

Catherine. Yes.

Hey.

23:44.580 --> 23:46.790
You guys decided
to take a break, too, huh?

23:46.790 --> 23:50.160
Whoa! Whoa, it’s lucky
you guys didn’t fall in there.

Yeah. Lucky us.

Oh, my God.

23:55.990 --> 23:56.950
What happened?

23:56.950 --> 23:58.120
Couple of hunters
showed up,

23:58.120 --> 23:59.330
robbed us, took
all our gear.

23:59.330 --> 24:01.790
Whoa, whoa, what about the maps?
The

24:01.790 --> 24:05.660

to get us to that bunker.

your butt bag.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.290
It’s a fanny pack.

24:09.290 --> 24:12.700
Not anymore.
Give it to me.

24:14.790 --> 24:16.870
All right.
You know, maybe we ought to

24:16.870 --> 24:18.580
just pull the rip cord
on this thing.

24:18.580 --> 24:21.290
I mean, she’s hurt,
we got no map,

24:21.290 --> 24:22.870
no weapons...

24:22.870 --> 24:23.990
No.

24:23.990 --> 24:24.950

She’s right.

She’s dead.

And now somebody
else has that money.

24:57.990 --> 25:00.990
Oh, son, I suggest
you get it back,

I wanted to join the military

36:49.620 --> 36:53.330
and serve my country
like you did, you said no.

36:53.330 --> 36:56.500
You flinched, and you said no.

36:58.700 --> 37:01.370
Losing one was enough.

37:04.660 --> 37:10.080
And I understand it must
be painful to lose a child.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.990
Just like how it was painful
for me to lose my best friend.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.910
Pops, all I wanted to say was...

37:34.370 --> 37:36.700
That’s just great.

37:38.580 --> 37:39.990
That’s great.

37:42.250 --> 37:45.410
Hey! Hey, is someone up there?

37:47.120 --> 37:48.410
Hey!

37:49.790 --> 37:51.990
Hey, buddy. Hey.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.790
Hey.
Hey!

37:54.790 --> 37:55.500
Hi.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.370
Are you okay?

37:56.370 --> 37:57.250
:
Yeah.

37:57.250 --> 37:59.990
I-I’m just a little banged up,
but, uh...

37:59.990 --> 38:02.040
Hey, how’d you find me?

38:02.040 --> 38:03.990
Did

38:03.990 --> 38:06.830
What? No, dude, he’s not Lassie.

38:06.830 --> 38:07.990
No, I know
where you like to run.

38:07.990 --> 38:10.040
But there’s a lot of paths here.
I’ve been looking for you

38:10.040 --> 38:12.120
for the last two hours.
Hang tight, okay?

38:12.120 --> 38:15.370
I’ll have a rescue crew here
in no time.

38:15.370 --> 38:17.120
Okay. Thanks.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.250
Okay.

38:21.870 --> 38:24.580
TANI:
All right. Thank you.

38:24.580 --> 38:27.200
Okay, so I’m gonna meet you
at the hospital.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.990
Okay.

38:28.990 --> 38:30.080
Hey, thank you.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.410
Uh, could I borrow
your phone for a sec?

38:32.410 --> 38:34.040
Mine’s dead.
Okay.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.990
All right.

38:43.990 --> 38:45.450
Hey, Dad.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.450
It’s me.

38:47.700 --> 38:51.080
Yeah, uh, I’m sorry
I missed your birthday.

38:51.750 --> 38:53.500
Yeah, I got stuck.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.120
Um, hey, you think maybe

38:55.120 --> 38:58.290
I could swing by
sometime tomorrow?

38:59.990 --> 39:01.990
Yeah?

39:01.990 --> 39:04.120
♪ ♪

39:06.540 --> 39:07.990
GROVER:A Navy EOD team

39:07.990 --> 39:09.120
just landed
on Kaho’olawe.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.990
Soon as they
clear the bombs

39:10.990 --> 39:13.250
out of that bunker,
then we can send in

39:13.250 --> 39:16.450
a crime scene unit
to, uh, process the place.

39:16.450 --> 39:17.870
Actually,
that won’t be necessary.

39:17.870 --> 39:20.660
Why not?
CATHERINE: Because after
the guy we were chasing

39:20.660 --> 39:21.870
tripped and blew
himself up,

39:21.870 --> 39:24.830
we searched the bunker
and recovered a cell.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.000
I was then able to use that

39:26.000 --> 39:27.660
to pinpoint a real-time
location on Asad,

39:27.660 --> 39:31.370
and there is now a SEAL team
currently taking him down

39:31.370 --> 39:32.500
as we speak.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.990
Well, that is great news.

39:33.990 --> 39:35.040
It is.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.080
Ooh, sorry. Excuse me.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.250
Mm-hmm.
One second.

39:40.330 --> 39:41.990
So...

39:42.370 --> 39:43.750
Was it nice to catch up?

39:43.750 --> 39:46.660
Yeah, I mean, take away
the spike pit,

39:46.660 --> 39:48.540
the gunfire
and the explosions,

39:48.540 --> 39:49.370
uh, yeah.

39:49.370 --> 39:50.990
Yeah, it was nice.

39:52.410 --> 39:53.580
What?

39:53.580 --> 39:55.540
Nothing.

40:02.540 --> 40:04.160
Hey, buddy.

40:05.330 --> 40:07.750
What’s, uh... what’s with
the bow tie there, Jer?

40:07.750 --> 40:10.830
Oh, I’m going to the museum
to discuss my findings.

40:10.830 --> 40:12.990
I’m sure a couple of news crews
will want to interview me,

40:12.990 --> 40:14.990
so I figured I should
look presentable.

40:14.990 --> 40:16.500
Uh... yeah.

40:16.500 --> 40:19.450
About that,
Jerry, um...

40:19.450 --> 40:21.330
What?

40:22.540 --> 40:25.450
All the findings are fake.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.870
No, that’s not possible.

40:27.870 --> 40:29.620
What about the necklace
Catherine found?

40:29.620 --> 40:30.370
CATHERINE:
Also fake.

40:30.370 --> 40:32.250
I just spoke with my contact
at the museum.

40:32.250 --> 40:35.040
They carbon-dated all the items,
and it turns out

40:35.040 --> 40:37.330
they’re all
from the 1950s.

40:37.330 --> 40:37.990
What?

40:37.990 --> 40:39.990
STEVE:
Yeah, it seems a ship

40:39.990 --> 40:41.990
carrying mass-produced
tourist trinkets

40:41.990 --> 40:44.870
sank in 1957
en route from China.

40:44.870 --> 40:45.990
I guess the Navy must have

40:45.990 --> 40:47.370
come in and
salvaged it,

40:47.370 --> 40:49.450
stored that stuff away,
you know.

40:49.450 --> 40:53.790
So you’re saying my
once-in-a-lifetime find is...

40:53.790 --> 40:54.990
worthless?

40:54.990 --> 40:57.040
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.160
Afraid so.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.990
I’m so sorry, Jerry.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.290
Come on. Don’t worry
about it, buddy.

41:02.290 --> 41:02.990
Shake it off.

41:02.990 --> 41:05.000
Good news is she’s paying
for dinner.

41:05.000 --> 41:05.990
Oh, I am?

41:05.990 --> 41:08.500
Yeah, you almost got
both of us killed.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.750
Think it’s the least you can do.

41:11.370 --> 41:13.990
Okay, that’s fair.

41:13.990 --> 41:17.120
But I get to pick the place.

41:28.290 --> 41:29.660
JUNIOR:
Hey, cheer up, man.

41:29.660 --> 41:31.750
Okay, we’re talking
about a mystery

41:31.750 --> 41:33.540
that’s taken
archaeologists

41:33.540 --> 41:34.950
like 200 years trying
to figure it out.

41:34.950 --> 41:36.910
TANI:
Yeah, and think
of it this way.

41:36.910 --> 41:38.250
Now it’s-it’s
still out there

41:38.250 --> 41:39.200
for you to find.
Yeah.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.160
ADAM: Or perhaps
something like that

41:41.160 --> 41:43.620
just isn’t meant
to be found.

41:43.620 --> 41:45.990
Yeah, I’ll hold off for now.

41:45.990 --> 41:47.990
Finding King Kamehameha’s
grave site

41:47.990 --> 41:50.040
isn’t the only mystery
I’ve been working on.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.990
What, are you gonna
unlock the formula

41:51.990 --> 41:54.540
of, uh, Danny’s hair product?

41:54.540 --> 41:56.120
JERRY:
Nope.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.450
The Lost City of El Dorado.
Got some theories.

41:58.450 --> 41:59.700
I’ll tell you what, Jerry.

41:59.700 --> 42:03.160
That right there is an
expedition I would join you on.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.990
With that, I would
like to make a toast.

42:05.990 --> 42:10.580
To, uh, lost cities
and found friends.

42:10.580 --> 42:11.990
TANI:
And to Adam.

42:11.990 --> 42:13.160
May your trip to the mainland

42:13.160 --> 42:14.450
be filled with love
and affection.

42:14.450 --> 42:17.080
KAMEKONA:
And plenty of time
between the sheets.

42:18.540 --> 42:19.160
All right, easy, big guy.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.790
That’s my wife
you’re talking about there.

42:21.790 --> 42:23.040
KAMEKONA: How am I ever
going to be an uncle

42:23.040 --> 42:25.870
if you and Kono don’t get busy?

42:25.870 --> 42:28.370
Excuse me.

42:31.370 --> 42:33.410
Duke, what’s up?

42:33.580 --> 42:36.370
Just had a body wash up
on Ka’alawai Beach.

42:36.370 --> 42:37.990
GSW to the back of the head.

42:37.990 --> 42:39.830
We I.D.’d the body.

42:39.830 --> 42:42.120
Steve, it’s Noriko.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.160
Adam’s sister.
