WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:11.544
We're back. It's going to be
bigger and better than ever.

00:11.611 --> 00:14.447
Bucking, birds and banter.
Two new housemates?

00:14.514 --> 00:16.883
I grill more birds
than George Foreman.

00:16.950 --> 00:20.019
I'm young. I'm fresh.
(all) New boys!

00:20.086 --> 00:23.490
Charlotte woke up and thought,
"What am I doing in Gary's bed?"

00:23.556 --> 00:24.891
This is a disaster.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.326
(all cheer)

00:26.393 --> 00:28.261
The biggest argument ever.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.563
Engagement party's been
a fucking joke.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.665
It all ends in tears.

00:32.732 --> 00:33.767
I'm still in shock.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.636
She's got an apology in mind.
I'm not ready.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.639
It's a black cloud
over everything that makes us happy.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.409
I've got myself a bird.
She's a fucking worldie.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.577
Drink after drink after drink.

00:44.644 --> 00:47.414
I'm not going to let him
fucking ruin my night.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.249
You're a fucking arsehole!

00:49.315 --> 00:50.817
You're a fucking psycho!

00:50.884 --> 00:52.385
He's a fucking bell-end.

00:52.452 --> 00:55.088
Give me the ring.
Is this ever going to settle?

00:56.055 --> 00:57.724
Set them off at the same time.

00:58.758 --> 01:01.694
They are going to hate us tomorrow,
like.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.196
I'm on a rampage.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.132
Psycho Charlotte is back.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.404
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.606
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.942
If you look up pulling,
I'm next to it.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.011
I won't kiss a guy
without a six-pack.

01:18.077 --> 01:20.079
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.081
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:22.148 --> 01:24.184
Got the looks, the charm.
Just works.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.653
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:26.719 --> 01:28.488
The hardest graft I do is my hair.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.124
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:45.638 --> 01:49.342
You can imagine our anguish
when we're woken at 6.00am

01:49.409 --> 01:53.413
by the annoying fucking drill
of an alarm clock.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.681
(alarm clock rings)

01:56.883 --> 01:59.886
We get woken up at stupid o'clock
by Charlotte's alarm.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.223
What the fuck? Why has she
set it for this time? Is she thick?

02:03.289 --> 02:04.691
(alarm clock rings)

02:04.757 --> 02:06.626
(shouting)

02:08.161 --> 02:11.598
(Charlotte) I don't understand.
I didn't set the alarm clock.

02:11.664 --> 02:14.167
I don't even know
how to use the alarm clock.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.802
(muffled shouting)

02:18.204 --> 02:21.174
This is wicked.
It's better than Christmas morning.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.343
Then, another one goes off.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.911
(two alarm clocks ring)

02:28.147 --> 02:30.717
I definitely didn't set two off.

02:37.924 --> 02:41.361
(Vicky) It is definitely on purpose,
deliberate, malicious.

02:41.427 --> 02:44.264
An attack designed
to wake me up when I am tired.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.266
I know who's responsible.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.334
You won't be getting away with this.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.348
Everybody knows
we love a good fucking kip.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.717
To hit me where it hurts,
it's our sleep.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.786
They went straight to the heart.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.588
I intend to do exactly the same.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.709
After Charlotte's behaviour,

03:29.776 --> 03:33.746
she's got to have some retribution
for behaving like a psychopath.

03:33.813 --> 03:36.916
It's just standard, really.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.892
I'm so scared and I'm so worried

03:45.959 --> 03:48.428
and I don't know how people
are going to react

03:48.494 --> 03:50.597
to the fact that I smashed
the house up.

03:54.867 --> 03:58.338
Anna's here. The cheeky bitch
didn't even ring the doorbell.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.606
Not happy.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.208
I know. I'm sorry.

04:02.275 --> 04:05.778
Sorry isn't good enough.
There's a lot of damaged goods here.

04:05.845 --> 04:08.982
I want you to clean this
from top to bottom.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.316
I'm fucking furious.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.452
Even my mam doesn't make us clean.

04:12.518 --> 04:14.287
I'll clean everything today.

04:23.396 --> 04:26.065
We did wake the girls up
very, very, very early.

04:26.132 --> 04:28.134
I'm getting out. Off to the gym.

04:36.275 --> 04:39.078
Charlotte's reaction was
exactly what we wanted.

04:39.145 --> 04:41.047
It went perfectly to plan.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.683
The girls aren't clever enough
to get us back,

04:43.750 --> 04:45.418
unless they make it personal.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.820
If they do that,
I'll be proper fucked off.

04:47.887 --> 04:50.757
What do you reckon?
Will the birds try to get us back?

04:50.823 --> 04:54.160
They'll try to get us back.
They'll do something shit.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.695
We'll just go one better.

04:55.762 --> 04:59.966
Someone wax their fucking arsehole
and stick it on Charlotte's face.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.038
After the great pranks

05:05.104 --> 05:08.775
that the boys played last night
with pathetic alarm clocks,

05:08.841 --> 05:12.845
me and Vicky think
it's time to get them back.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.580
(Vicky) I am a nasty bastard.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.983
Sophie is a vile bitch.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.252
I can't think of any two people

05:19.318 --> 05:21.988
who'd be better suited
to go and get our revenge.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.628
This is an under-counter thing.
Oh, my God.

05:28.695 --> 05:29.962
What the fuck's that?

05:30.029 --> 05:32.899
This is really, really strong.
What is it?

05:32.965 --> 05:36.135
Barfume is the most disgusting
smelling stench

05:36.202 --> 05:38.037
you will ever come across.

05:38.104 --> 05:40.139
Oh, my days. Fuck me.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.008
Not nice, is it?
What is that?

05:42.075 --> 05:43.843
We'll have two of them, please.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.246
Oh, my God.
Jesus Christ.

05:47.313 --> 05:49.048
Oh, my God.

05:49.115 --> 05:52.085
This is going to be so good.

05:55.722 --> 05:59.325
(Charlotte) As punishment,
Anna is making us clean up.

05:59.392 --> 06:00.560
For God's sake, man.

06:00.626 --> 06:03.429
I have come up with a new invention.

06:03.496 --> 06:07.166
It's called the Sponge Stick.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.202
What are you doing?

06:09.268 --> 06:11.704
I'm going to attach
loads of sponges...

06:13.239 --> 06:17.043
...to the end of this
to make a giant sponge.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.811
She thinks it'd be brilliant

06:18.878 --> 06:23.082
to make a sponge device
with two sponges and a stick,

06:23.149 --> 06:25.685
which is actually clever
and inventive,

06:25.752 --> 06:28.821
and then to go
and wash all the plates in the bath.

06:28.888 --> 06:29.922
Urgh!

06:29.989 --> 06:31.090
I know.

06:36.362 --> 06:37.630
Be free!

06:45.505 --> 06:49.408
I am going to make
such a good housewife.

06:49.475 --> 06:52.345
I'm surprised men aren't
knocking at the door now,

06:52.411 --> 06:54.814
just wanting to stare at me
while I clean

06:54.881 --> 06:56.783
and wank.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.485
The boys, we're going
to go out for a manly day,

06:59.552 --> 07:02.088
do something fun
that girls could never do.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.556
Clay-pigeon shooting.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.027
(all cheer)

07:08.094 --> 07:09.629
I'm wicked at this.

07:09.695 --> 07:13.399
I'm going to pretend the pigeon is
a bird and shoot my load all over.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.568
No surprise, I'm good at shooting.

07:15.635 --> 07:19.338
I'm already the proud owner
of two massive guns.

07:19.405 --> 07:20.773
(all cheer)

07:20.840 --> 07:22.809
Fucking get in.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.444
I want to do something mint
for James's birthday

07:25.511 --> 07:26.846
that's never been done.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.364
Gaz suggests Dublin
for James's birthday.

07:45.431 --> 07:46.766
Buzzing with the idea.

07:46.833 --> 07:50.436
I reckon bring Kate along as well.
Make it the best birthday ever.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.982
Gaz is taking the piss
out of Scott's pink shorts.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.517
No-one else noticed.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.553
I guess Gaz is used
to staring at Scott's arse.

08:12.925 --> 08:16.128
All shooting. We're having banter.
But Ricci's not here.

08:16.195 --> 08:17.797
I know he would have loved it.

08:18.764 --> 08:21.467
Turns out I'm as good
at smashing clay pigeons

08:21.534 --> 08:23.069
as I am smashing birds.

08:32.745 --> 08:36.649
All I want for my birthday is just to
have a nice night out in Newcastle

08:36.716 --> 08:38.317
and go for a meal with Kate.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.923
Dublin.
Oh, my God.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.291
Ireland?
Seriously?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.560
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

08:47.627 --> 08:49.862
They tell us
that we're going to Dublin.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.498
Ireland. Irish people. Guinness.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.166
Leprechauns. Clovers.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.335
I am so excited.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.807
(Scott) To be fair,
it's James's birthday.

09:01.874 --> 09:05.478
What more would he want than Kate
and everyone having a good time?

09:05.544 --> 09:08.881
Scott's going to give her a ring
and arrange for Kate to come.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.384
Hello. All right?
"Hi, Scott. All right?"

09:11.450 --> 09:12.818
Sound. Listen.

09:12.885 --> 09:17.323
We've organised James to go
to Dublin tomorrow,

09:17.390 --> 09:19.659
obviously for his birthday
and stuff.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.928
We're wanting
to fly you over as well.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.095
Are you up for it?

09:23.162 --> 09:25.731
"Oh, yeah. Sounds good.
Up for that."

09:25.798 --> 09:27.466
I call Kate to arrange Dublin.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.068
I'm buzzing she can make it.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.537
James is going to have
a fucking stiffy.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.105
Nice one. See you in a bit.

09:33.172 --> 09:35.308
I don't know
how Holly is going to feel.

09:35.374 --> 09:38.477
She hasn't come to terms with it.
I don't know if she will.

09:42.548 --> 09:44.250
(Vicky) I need to see Ricci.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.286
I feel as though
our relationship is in limbo.

09:47.353 --> 09:50.222
I don't think we've
resolved everything we need to.

09:50.289 --> 09:51.524
I'm going to go see him

09:51.590 --> 09:54.760
and get some answers
and find out what he's thinking.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.762
Cos I'm driving myself insane.

09:56.829 --> 10:00.499
I just want to see him. I just miss
him. I don't want him to get angry.

10:00.566 --> 10:04.170
I've let him go on like a dickhead
for far too long.

10:04.236 --> 10:07.907
I just want to see
more of the lovely Ricci who's fun

10:07.974 --> 10:11.043
and less of possessive, jealous Ricci

10:11.110 --> 10:14.046
who, when he's had a couple
of drinks, is a bit of a tit.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.582
I'm feeling apprehensive and anxious.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.452
Luckily, Charlotte doesn't seem
to have noticed.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.922
She seems keen to get me to help her
with her crossword puzzle.

10:22.989 --> 10:25.958
D is the beginning of "tow, pull".
Three letters.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.428
Are you sure it's not four
and "drag"?

10:29.495 --> 10:31.864
Oh, it's four.
Then it's "drag".

10:31.931 --> 10:34.567
Yeah. One of the boxes
was shaded in blue.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.302
Sneaky little box.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.603
Drag.

10:37.670 --> 10:41.374
I am so good at crosswords,
especially arrows and lines.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.244
That's my favourite one. It always
gives you a clue. The clue's easy.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.646
Baked?
Ending in D.

10:47.713 --> 10:48.948
Cooked.

10:49.015 --> 10:51.250
Cooked! Dur...

10:51.317 --> 10:56.422
Watching Charlotte try a crossword
is like watching a dog use a fork.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.291
But it does take my mind off
what's gonna happen.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.797
Sexy!

11:05.998 --> 11:08.734
See you all later. Have a nice night.
Bye! Enjoy!

11:09.802 --> 11:11.537
I'm so anxious about tonight,

11:11.604 --> 11:13.172
because on one hand,

11:13.239 --> 11:15.908
I'm so excited cos
I've missed him and I love him.

11:15.975 --> 11:18.911
But on the other hand,
I know how wrong it could go.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.783
You look lovely.
So do you.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.018
All I want from tonight

11:26.085 --> 11:30.389
is for him to genuinely feel upset
for what's happened

11:30.456 --> 11:31.757
and just want to...

11:31.824 --> 11:34.493
Not put it all behind us,
but discuss it.

11:35.494 --> 11:38.330
I want to be with you.
To marry you. Everything else.

11:38.397 --> 11:40.433
But I want to be able to be myself.

11:42.268 --> 11:45.704
That's your decision.
Not get shouted at for having fun.

11:45.771 --> 11:48.507
Not get accused of things
when I've done nothing.

11:48.574 --> 11:52.645
With me and Vicky arguing, it's two
stubborn people against each other.

11:52.711 --> 11:55.247
I don't want to back down.
She doesn't want to.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.049
It just never gets sorted.

11:57.983 --> 12:00.920
It's just so blatantly obvious

12:00.986 --> 12:04.356
that he's not in the place
where I want him to be.

12:04.423 --> 12:07.726
My stomach's in bits.
We'll get something worked out.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.429
It's not the choice I want.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.732
All you've gotta do
is focus on the fact that...

12:13.799 --> 12:17.336
It's easier for you in the house.
It's not easy. I'm without you.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.238
I'm devastated.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.207
I'm disappointed and I'm gutted.

12:21.273 --> 12:23.309
You're making this dead difficult.

12:23.375 --> 12:27.079
You could have made this fucking
nice. I want to make it nice.

12:27.146 --> 12:28.247
No, you don't.

12:28.314 --> 12:31.450
You want to come and make us feel bad
cos I don't want to go.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.586
I'm not saying that.
Then why...

12:33.652 --> 12:36.655
I knew you'd want to stay.
I want to stay because...

12:36.722 --> 12:39.358
I'm not bothered.
Right, fine.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.460
I can't put myself
back in the house.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.762
It would be the wrong thing to do.

12:43.829 --> 12:47.666
This conversation, this meeting,
everything is completely futile.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.279
We're going to Dublin!

13:00.346 --> 13:02.681
All I want to hear is,
"Top of the morning."

13:02.748 --> 13:06.719
I'm riding these waves like I'm
riding some bird's fucking back end.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.921
Buzzing. This has made my birthday.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.358
I'm so fucking jealous.

13:12.424 --> 13:14.226
I'm in my fucking element.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.128
I wouldn't want to be a worldie

13:16.195 --> 13:18.564
who sits in a tight dress
and doesn't move.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.866
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:38.184 --> 13:40.653
I woke up this morning
and it's me birthday.

13:40.719 --> 13:45.324
(all) # Happy birthday dear James

13:45.391 --> 13:50.029
# Happy birthday to you #

13:50.095 --> 13:53.732
Oh, God. James, we're taking you
on a surprise trip.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.335
But we're not telling you
where we're going.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.436
(all hum)

13:57.503 --> 13:59.371
There might be leprechauns!

14:00.639 --> 14:04.610
The guys tell us they've got
a surprise. We're off to Ireland.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.680
Dublin. I can't fucking wait.
I love the Irish.

14:07.746 --> 14:10.082
(all cheer)

14:10.149 --> 14:11.917
Quick. You've got an hour.

14:11.984 --> 14:16.088
And then we're having
a pint of Guinness. Oh, my God.

14:16.155 --> 14:19.124
Today we're going to Dublin!

14:23.495 --> 14:25.898
Don't get us wrong.
I'm absolutely buzzing

14:25.965 --> 14:29.101
with all the effort the guys
went through to book Dublin.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.170
But I do wish that Kate was coming.

14:32.671 --> 14:36.041
I don't know a lot about Ireland.
I know I love the accent.

14:36.108 --> 14:37.843
I know they're all game as fuck.

14:37.910 --> 14:41.614
I just want to get on this flight,
get there and fucking smash it.

14:43.315 --> 14:46.485
I'm happy we're going.
I've been practising Gaelic.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.354
(speaks pretend Gaelic)

14:54.760 --> 14:56.262
(James) Get to the airport.

14:56.328 --> 14:59.798
I've got a tiny suspicion
that Kate might be there, but no.

14:59.865 --> 15:01.300
It's not gonna happen.

15:01.367 --> 15:04.203
(Charlotte cheers)
We're in Ireland, everyone!

15:04.270 --> 15:06.705
(all cheer)

15:06.772 --> 15:11.076
So, we arrive in Ireland,
and I can just smell Irish.

15:14.446 --> 15:18.417
The sun's shining. It's just like
being in a foreign country.

15:18.484 --> 15:22.721
I can't fucking wait. All I want
to hear is, "Top of the morning."

15:25.758 --> 15:28.694
Get to Ireland to find
we've got two houses.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.929
One for the lads
and one for the lasses.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.699
I'm buzzing.
Finally, a bit of peace and quiet.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.903
The fucking birthday boy gets a
double bed to his fucking self, like.

15:37.970 --> 15:42.241
We've got a girls' pad and a
boys' pad, which is fucking perfect.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.209
We're gonna have a good time here.

15:44.276 --> 15:48.080
When it comes down to it and we
wanna bang, we're away from them.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.586
We're going on a yacht
for me birthday.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.288
Should call us the captain.

15:56.355 --> 15:59.692
Right. You've gotta do your cum face.
One, two, three!

16:00.793 --> 16:02.528
(all laugh)

16:05.331 --> 16:06.532
I don't like boats.

16:06.598 --> 16:10.969
I'm not gonna wait to get eaten
by a shark or blown over by a wave.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.204
No. Fuck off.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.809
I'm buzzing.
I'm gonna be riding the waves

16:16.875 --> 16:19.411
like I'm riding
some bird's fucking back end.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.615
I've been missing Kate,

16:23.682 --> 16:27.486
but now I'm on the boat
I'm starting to enjoy myself.

16:27.553 --> 16:28.954
(all cheer)

16:31.724 --> 16:33.859
James is having such a good time.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.829
His comb-over is
blowing in the wind.

16:36.895 --> 16:38.931
It's like a kind of punk-over now.

16:38.997 --> 16:41.500
James, what the fuck's wrong
with your hair?

16:41.567 --> 16:44.737
It was a comb-over, and now...
Has anyone got a comb?

16:44.803 --> 16:46.805
It's a fucking all-over.

16:48.874 --> 16:50.109
That wasn't me!

16:50.175 --> 16:54.012
Gary's driving the boat
and I'm enjoying riding this boat

16:54.079 --> 16:57.149
just as much as I used
to enjoy riding Gary.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.518
Not at all.

17:06.925 --> 17:10.028
(Gary) I love this.
I love speed. I love anything fast.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.865
Ask Charlotte.
She knows all about it.

17:20.638 --> 17:23.008
Back at the house, getting ready.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.777
Tonight is gonna be massive.

17:24.843 --> 17:28.847
Dublin's not gonna know what fucking
hit it. The Geordies have arrived.

17:32.951 --> 17:37.022
(Holly) We're not gonna let
our standards slip.

17:37.089 --> 17:40.025
If anything,
it means we need more tan,

17:40.092 --> 17:42.161
bigger hair and bigger eyelashes.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.329
(Vicky) It is a great trip away.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.598
There's these amazing things
going on.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.534
But Ricci's not here.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.169
Are you missing Ricci, Vic?

17:50.235 --> 17:54.039
Yeah. I am missing him. Starting
to get a bit much without him.

17:54.106 --> 17:55.941
All of us girls need to go out

17:56.008 --> 17:58.410
and don't give a fuck
about our boyfriends.

17:58.477 --> 18:00.479
Let's stick together and just party

18:00.546 --> 18:04.049
and for once not cry and moan
over our boyfriends.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.251
Let our hair down.

18:06.318 --> 18:11.523
We'll have a little cheeky week
and maybe a boogie on down.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.127
So, we get back to the house
and everyone's getting ready.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.663
James doesn't know
that Kate's gonna come.

18:17.729 --> 18:20.666
(Holly) I'm happy
that he'll get his birthday wish

18:20.732 --> 18:22.167
and then he can be happy.

18:25.404 --> 18:28.240
I don't think she's bothered.
She's good-looking.

18:28.307 --> 18:31.043
She knows she's unreal
and that he loves her.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.315
Bothered?

18:37.716 --> 18:39.084
Guilty.

18:40.118 --> 18:43.789
(Dan) I'm buzzing. Irish girls
are just like Geordie girls.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.725
Game as fuck. I wanna make sure
James has a mint time,

18:46.792 --> 18:50.028
have a mint time myself
and hopefully pull an Irish beau.

18:50.095 --> 18:51.597
(Sophie) Hi, boys.

18:51.663 --> 18:53.265
(all) Hi!

18:53.332 --> 18:55.334
Dublin, are you ready?

18:55.400 --> 18:59.037
Cos us Geordies are there
and we are gonna hit the town!

18:59.104 --> 19:00.939
Paint it black and white.

19:01.006 --> 19:04.710
Get Jagers out
and smell the fake tan, Ireland.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.117
Basically, it's me birthday,

19:12.184 --> 19:15.921
and it's just a little excuse
to get absolutely...

19:17.823 --> 19:19.157
(all cheer)

19:19.224 --> 19:21.894
That was meant to work better.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.396
(Scott) Happy birthday, lad.
(all cheer)

19:30.936 --> 19:34.039
We're all having a mint family meal
for James's birthday.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.142
Cannot wait to see his face
when Kate walks in the door.

19:37.209 --> 19:40.979
I see a cake. I'm thinking,
"I've already got one of them."

19:41.046 --> 19:43.282
I look up
and it's Kate holding the cake.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.318
Promised you, didn't I?
I don't even know what to say.

19:46.385 --> 19:47.920
(all cheer)

19:47.986 --> 19:51.056
(Charlotte) Holly's smiling,
but she's gotta smile.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.959
If she doesn't,
then she looks jealous.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.595
Fucking buzzing.
This has made my birthday.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.100
I'm looking at him and I'm like,

20:02.167 --> 20:05.003
"I wish you looked at me
the way you look at her."

20:05.070 --> 20:08.740
But I'm sure I'll find somebody
that looks at me like that one time.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.042
Maybe.

20:14.813 --> 20:18.216
Vicky is watching Kate and James
kissing and cuddling

20:18.283 --> 20:19.284
and all loved-up.

20:19.351 --> 20:22.754
She's gonna get upset cos
it's reminding her of her and Ricci.

20:25.791 --> 20:28.260
So, I wouldn't have thought
out of everybody

20:28.327 --> 20:31.129
it'd be Vicky crying
about seeing James and Kate.

20:36.368 --> 20:40.238
No. Not at all. You miss your
boyfriend. It's a natural feeling.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.374
Vicky's chose to go home tonight.

20:42.441 --> 20:46.078
We said we'd go with her
but she wants to be by herself.

20:46.144 --> 20:47.846
I feel so bad.

20:49.948 --> 20:52.784
Food done, drinks, mortal.
Onto the nightclub.

20:55.387 --> 20:59.091
We're off to the club and everyone's
in a good mood, even James,

20:59.157 --> 21:01.360
cos he got the present
he always wanted.

21:01.426 --> 21:05.530
I love him that much to be able to
say, like, I'm so glad he's happy.

21:05.597 --> 21:06.732
I really am.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.845
Rock up to the club.
The birds are absolutely lethal.

21:19.911 --> 21:21.813
I'm in my fucking element.

21:23.882 --> 21:27.252
So, right now me and Charlotte have
ate and we're like, fuck.

21:27.319 --> 21:29.388
I'm so sick of being a fat slag.

21:29.454 --> 21:33.058
I found two bright-yellow t-shirts.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.594
Wow. We look fucking hot.

21:39.364 --> 21:42.367
It is weird seeing James
with a bird in the first place.

21:42.434 --> 21:45.971
Seeing James with a bird and being
so into her and so loved-up...

21:46.038 --> 21:49.374
It's fucking crazy.
It's another man down.

21:49.441 --> 21:50.642
I'm not bothered.

21:51.510 --> 21:52.911
So bothered!

22:01.720 --> 22:05.057
"My girlfriend's a worldie."
I wouldn't want to be a worldie

22:05.123 --> 22:08.360
who sits there in a tight dress
and doesn't move.

22:10.929 --> 22:12.597
Holly and Kate are talking.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.800
I'm kind of wondering,

22:14.866 --> 22:18.503
are they exchanging stories
on the best ways to make James come?

22:30.615 --> 22:33.218
So, when it was, like,
me and James together,

22:33.285 --> 22:35.320
we had the fun, the flanter.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.322
We were like best mates who bucked.

22:37.389 --> 22:41.326
And when I look at James and Kate,
they're just boring as fuck.

22:49.468 --> 22:53.105
So, I feel right now
that I know James doesn't want me,

22:53.171 --> 22:55.340
but he still wants me to want him.

22:55.407 --> 22:57.843
Like, how the fuck
can you think that's OK?

22:59.878 --> 23:04.015
It doesn't matter where we go.
The boys are up to their old tricks.

23:04.082 --> 23:06.985
All they're bothered about
is finding Gaelic gash.

23:09.955 --> 23:12.557
The Irish are game as fuck.
They love a Geordie.

23:12.624 --> 23:15.360
I've been here two minutes.
I've already pulled.

23:26.772 --> 23:29.107
Necking on.
I might even move to Ireland,

23:29.174 --> 23:32.677
but I don't think they can handle
the fucking bad boy.

23:34.446 --> 23:38.016
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You got it. You got it.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.286
It's been the best birthday ever
in me whole entire life.

23:41.353 --> 23:44.055
I have everything
that I've ever wanted.

23:44.122 --> 23:47.559
All James bangs on about is
having this perfect worldie.

23:47.626 --> 23:50.028
I wouldn't want to be
a fucking worldie.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.863
I want to go out, roll around,

23:51.930 --> 23:54.266
get mortal
and make a fucking tit of myself

23:54.332 --> 23:56.601
and not give a fuck
what any lad thinks.

24:04.876 --> 24:07.679
I'm first back with my bird.
Bedroom's mine.

24:07.746 --> 24:10.048
Gaz can shag
in the ironing cupboard.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.865
This is amazing.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.202
Rattled this mint bird all over.

24:30.268 --> 24:32.904
I'm getting
a fucking season ticket to Dublin.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.744
We're gonna go sightseeing,
cos we're dead cultural.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.012
Fuck off. No, thanks.

24:41.079 --> 24:44.482
Part of us just wants to jump
on that plane with her and go home.

24:44.549 --> 24:47.085
It's prank night.
(girls scream)

24:47.152 --> 24:49.087
Birthday celebrations round two.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.724
Scott hasn't pulled.
He's gonna pull my bird.

24:53.892 --> 24:56.161
I feel like they're gonna murder us.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.430
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

25:31.663 --> 25:34.132
I'm not surprised
that Holly and Kate got on.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.500
Not in the slightest.

25:35.567 --> 25:39.004
Holly is, in my eyes,
famous for one thing.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.740
That's just
complete and utter denial.

25:41.806 --> 25:42.941
(burps)

25:43.008 --> 25:45.410
Deep down,
Holly doesn't fucking like her.

25:45.477 --> 25:46.478
Let's face it.

25:46.544 --> 25:49.414
When are you ever going
to like your ex's new lass?

25:49.481 --> 25:51.516
Especially when she looks like Kate.

25:52.517 --> 25:53.652
(burps)

25:59.124 --> 26:02.427
(James) Last night was mint.
I had the best birthday ever.

26:02.494 --> 26:06.364
We're in Ireland, so where else
to go but the Leprechaun Museum?

26:13.104 --> 26:15.807
We're still in Ireland
for one more day.

26:15.874 --> 26:19.344
We're gonna go sightseeing,
cos we're dead cultural and that.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.747
We're off to a leprechaun museum.
They're not fucking real,

26:22.814 --> 26:24.516
so how can there be a museum?

26:26.952 --> 26:32.324
Come today for your tour
around the museum of fake shit.

26:32.390 --> 26:34.359
Fuck off. No, thanks.

26:36.328 --> 26:39.331
(Dan) I don't know
what leprechauns are. I don't care.

26:39.397 --> 26:42.000
I'd rather kick a breezeblock
with sandals on

26:42.067 --> 26:43.935
than walk round this museum.

26:48.106 --> 26:51.242
We go into this room
that's got giant furniture

26:51.309 --> 26:53.545
that makes you feel
like a leprechaun.

26:53.611 --> 26:57.582
I am feeling the most leprechaun-ish
I have ever felt.

26:57.649 --> 27:00.885
It's my turn! Don't. Don't.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.787
I bet that's dusty up there.

27:06.224 --> 27:08.293
I've learnt a lot
at the museum today.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.997
The main thing I've learnt is that
I don't want to be a leprechaun.

27:12.063 --> 27:13.665
I'm so glad I was born a human.

27:16.868 --> 27:19.037
Fucking leprechauns.

27:19.104 --> 27:20.638
Suck us off, man.

27:30.148 --> 27:33.051
I've had such
a good birthday weekend with Kate.

27:33.118 --> 27:35.387
I'm gutted
I've got to say goodbye now.

27:35.453 --> 27:38.623
Part of us wants to jump
on that plane with her and go home.

27:38.690 --> 27:40.425
You gonna fit us in your bag?

27:40.492 --> 27:42.394
I don't think I'll fit you in there.

27:43.762 --> 27:44.963
I'll miss you.

27:45.030 --> 27:47.399
I know. I'll miss you.

27:47.465 --> 27:49.734
My mission is finally over.

27:49.801 --> 27:52.604
I've bagged myself
the queen of fucking worldies.

27:56.674 --> 28:00.578
Being with Kate is making it
ten times harder in Geordie Shore.

28:00.645 --> 28:04.115
I'd be lying if I was to say
I haven't thought about leaving.

28:07.952 --> 28:10.422
On our quest
to enjoy all things Irish today,

28:10.488 --> 28:12.757
we are going Irish dancing.

28:12.824 --> 28:17.362
To be honest, I think it sounds
fucking shit, but I'll give it a go.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.197
I've heard of the Irish jig

28:19.264 --> 28:23.334
and I think it's the Irish version
of the slut drop.

28:23.401 --> 28:26.304
Go on, then. Let's get started.

28:28.907 --> 28:31.443
Irish dancing,
canny fucking hard, like,

28:31.509 --> 28:35.447
but it's even harder when all I can
think about is banging the teacher.

28:37.682 --> 28:39.984
And what the hell are
them kind of moves?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.921
Why would people even move
their feet like that?

28:42.987 --> 28:45.690
Is that what you do
in the middle of a nightclub?

28:53.231 --> 28:56.568
(Vicky) We're having fun.
Everyone's in such a good mood.

28:56.634 --> 28:58.970
It does feel
like we're getting on so well.

28:59.037 --> 29:02.874
I think we're all acting
like a family.

29:05.276 --> 29:07.479
We're all swinging each other round.

29:07.545 --> 29:11.049
I've got this press stud top on
and it pops open

29:11.116 --> 29:13.218
and me tit's just dangling out.

29:13.284 --> 29:14.519
God, man.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.987
It's always me.

29:16.054 --> 29:17.455
I'm such a victim.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.625
Now you've shown us
how to do your dancing,

29:20.692 --> 29:23.828
we want to show you how to do
our dancing. Are you up for it?

29:23.895 --> 29:26.731
Geordies, come on then!
Come on then.

29:26.798 --> 29:30.201
Ireland has given us so much
and we've had so much fun.

29:30.268 --> 29:33.238
It seems only fair
that we leave them with our legacy.

29:33.304 --> 29:34.339
The slut drop.

29:34.405 --> 29:36.508
Oh, my God. They're so sexy.

29:36.574 --> 29:40.612
But there's loads of women round.
You are fighting for their attention.

29:40.678 --> 29:42.480
They don't notice you.

29:42.547 --> 29:44.349
What is the only thing to do?

29:44.415 --> 29:46.050
(girls) Slut drop!

29:47.385 --> 29:49.420
I'm glad that when we came
to Ireland

29:49.487 --> 29:51.789
we've actually contributed
something.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.441
I can't believe
what the guys have pulled off.

30:10.508 --> 30:14.479
They couldn't have given us
a better birthday if they tried.

30:14.546 --> 30:18.416
Well, I'm definitely coming back
to Ireland. The fanny is lethal.

30:20.518 --> 30:24.756
It's weird that Dublin
has brought us all closer.

30:27.692 --> 30:29.227
Yay!

30:29.294 --> 30:30.595
Home.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.400
Home sweet home!

30:35.466 --> 30:37.669
We might be tired. We just landed.

30:37.735 --> 30:41.306
There's no chance the boys are
letting the side down. To Bijoux.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.010
What's the plan tonight, boys?

30:46.077 --> 30:48.780
Just fucking lads' night out.

30:48.846 --> 30:52.717
Buzzing for tonight. All the boys
are out. The lasses are staying in.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.919
No birds. No drama.

30:54.986 --> 30:57.422
We're just gonna get fucking on one.

30:57.488 --> 30:58.556
Have a good time.

30:58.623 --> 31:01.559
Birds don't seem up for it again,
do they?

31:01.626 --> 31:04.095
Tired, aren't they?
Drained, man. Drained.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.064
Tonight, it's just the lads out.

31:06.130 --> 31:08.967
That means the girls are
in the house by themselves.

31:09.033 --> 31:12.003
I hope they don't remember
the pranks and get us back.

31:19.077 --> 31:20.678
Tonight is the night

31:20.745 --> 31:24.749
we make the lads wish
they were never, ever, born.

31:24.816 --> 31:26.317
It's prank night.

31:29.687 --> 31:34.259
(James) We're off out tonight. Just
the lads. None of the girls are out.

31:34.325 --> 31:36.694
Birthday celebrations round two.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.663
(all cheer)

31:43.434 --> 31:47.572
They think hiding a couple of alarm
clocks is oh-so-scary. Oh, great.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.173
Nah. Watch what we've got.

31:50.775 --> 31:51.943
Fuck me. Fuck me.

31:53.311 --> 31:56.481
Do it quick,
cos I swear to fucking God...

31:56.547 --> 31:57.649
(shouts)

31:57.715 --> 32:00.184
So, we've got all these,
like, bangers.

32:00.251 --> 32:03.888
You place them underneath things.
When you pick them up, it bangs.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.024
They're fiddly, aren't they?
(bang)

32:06.090 --> 32:07.292
(all scream)

32:08.393 --> 32:10.061
What the fuck happened there?

32:10.128 --> 32:13.665
We intend to booby trap every item
in this house you hold dear.

32:13.731 --> 32:14.732
(bang)

32:14.799 --> 32:16.501
(all scream)

32:16.567 --> 32:19.237
I hope you're ready for this,
bitches.

32:21.239 --> 32:25.043
Cracking on with this bird.
Two minutes later, Dan comes over.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.845
This is like fucking deja vu.

32:27.912 --> 32:31.316
Scott hasn't pulled,
so he's gonna try and pull my bird.

32:38.823 --> 32:40.658
I don't know what Dan's craic is.

32:40.725 --> 32:43.328
Every time we're out,
he tries to bagsy birds.

32:43.394 --> 32:45.330
If I wanted to have them, I could.

32:49.334 --> 32:53.504
She'd much rather be with me,
anyway. I'm having a cheeky neck-on.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.883
I've had a mint night with the lads.

33:05.950 --> 33:10.154
I'm absolutely mortal, so all I want
to do is go home and go to bed.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.400
Listen, watch out for booby traps.

33:22.467 --> 33:25.370
Me and the lads get back
to the house and it's quiet.

33:25.436 --> 33:28.439
There's no screaming.
There's something going on.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.109
Ah!

33:32.810 --> 33:35.346
So, we hear the boys come back

33:35.413 --> 33:38.516
and maybe the pranks went
a little bit too far.

33:42.687 --> 33:47.125
So, I walk into my bedroom and
instantly all I can smell is shit.

33:47.191 --> 33:50.762
I think, "Right." Either Charlotte's
had a shit in the corner

33:50.828 --> 33:52.764
or slept in me bed for an hour.

33:52.830 --> 33:56.067
Here, something's going on.
Our bedroom smells of shit.

33:56.134 --> 33:58.636
We feel like we went too far.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.238
We're so physically scared

34:00.304 --> 34:03.741
we're now piled up against the door
so no-one can get in

34:03.808 --> 34:06.944
cos for some reason I feel like
they're gonna murder us.

34:08.946 --> 34:12.283
We sit at the door. We don't want
them to come in. We're scared.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.551
We're even shaking.

34:15.853 --> 34:16.987
(small bang)

34:17.054 --> 34:19.524
(all cheer)
Oh, my God. That got us.

34:19.590 --> 34:20.992
(bang)

34:22.159 --> 34:23.494
There's your banger.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.199
I think the girls have made
a good effort, mind,

34:28.266 --> 34:31.768
but they're still nowhere
near as good as us at pranking.

34:32.770 --> 34:35.172
Can you... Get you to bed.

34:35.239 --> 34:39.944
I'm absolutely fucking mortal
and for once it's like role reversal.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.879
Holly's the one putting me to bed.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.648
Making sure I'm all right.

34:43.714 --> 34:46.117
I hope she doesn't try
and jump in with us.

34:46.184 --> 34:50.688
Thank you.
I'm glad you've switched roles

34:50.755 --> 34:54.292
and been the fucking, erm...

34:54.358 --> 34:57.695
I don't know what the word is,
but I might know in the morning.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.164
OK. Right. Thank you. High five.
High five.

35:01.566 --> 35:05.503
It's hard seeing James this mortal
and not taking advantage.

35:05.570 --> 35:09.373
Whole room smells
like Charlotte on a good day.

35:10.374 --> 35:12.343
My bed. Right. Right.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.611
There's the bed.

35:13.678 --> 35:15.446
Bed smells like Charlotte?

35:16.681 --> 35:20.418
No. The bed smells
like fucking daisies.

35:20.485 --> 35:21.652
Goodnight, you.

35:21.719 --> 35:24.622
Goodnight. Love you.
Love you too.

35:24.689 --> 35:27.725
I haven't got a vibrator, you know.
I have. I've got two.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.061
Nothing compares to the real thing.

35:30.127 --> 35:32.530
I need to take him home
and shag him.

35:32.597 --> 35:33.598
(shrieks)

35:33.664 --> 35:35.800
So, the doorbell goes
and it's Ricci.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.268
I've got no idea.

35:37.335 --> 35:40.805
I can't put me and her
through this any more.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.607
I'm absolutely gutted.

35:44.675 --> 35:47.044
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

36:09.467 --> 36:12.303
So, are you not a little
tiny bit horny sometimes?

36:12.370 --> 36:13.771
I'm ridiculously horny.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.541
I'm looking at people
in very different ways.

36:16.607 --> 36:17.909
Are you?

36:17.975 --> 36:22.413
Me, Sophie and Holly have been
feeling so horny lately.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.382
Our clits never stop throbbing.

36:24.448 --> 36:26.384
I haven't got a vibrator, you know.

36:26.450 --> 36:27.718
I have. I've got two.

36:27.785 --> 36:30.221
I've got two
and loads of different things.

36:30.288 --> 36:33.257
I was gonna bring mine in,
but me mam wouldn't let us.

36:33.324 --> 36:34.859
She said it was disgusting.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.961
All the girls are extremely horny.

36:37.028 --> 36:41.499
We're talking about things and we're
like, "We need to buy vibrators."

36:41.566 --> 36:43.701
Well, do you wanna come with us
to look?

36:43.768 --> 36:45.503
Where, to a sex shop?

36:45.570 --> 36:48.906
Well, yeah. I'll come.
I can give you tips on what to buy.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.576
Shotgun!

36:52.643 --> 36:55.179
Me, Charlotte and Sophie
go to the sex shop

36:55.246 --> 36:57.548
and Gaz comes with us.

36:57.615 --> 36:59.250
I'm not sure why Gaz is there.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.395
How are you? Yeah.

37:12.630 --> 37:15.199
We came for some sex toys.
Jesus.

37:15.266 --> 37:18.603
We walk in there and there's
fucking dildos everywhere.

37:18.669 --> 37:20.771
I feel uncomfortable,
but to be fair,

37:20.838 --> 37:23.374
nothing's going to compare
to the real thing.

37:23.441 --> 37:27.545
Gary, that's like yours, that?
Bigger than mine, that one.

37:27.612 --> 37:29.614
My fanny is pulsing already.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.148
It's as big as the moon.

37:31.215 --> 37:33.317
It's gonna swallow
all these cocks up.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.655
What's that?
Oh, my God. It's got a real penis.

37:39.223 --> 37:40.925
Oh, my God.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.894
I have found an inflatable man.

37:43.961 --> 37:46.397
I need to take him home and shag him.

37:46.464 --> 37:48.866
I've got no-one else
to have sex with.

37:50.134 --> 37:51.202
(shrieks)

37:52.203 --> 37:54.138
I just did that. It was so weird.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.439
(screams)

37:56.874 --> 37:59.343
The man of everyone's dreams.

37:59.410 --> 38:02.246
The man that can
never answer back to you.

38:02.313 --> 38:03.781
That is constantly hard.

38:03.848 --> 38:06.651
Who looks good all the time.
Constantly wants sex.

38:06.717 --> 38:08.052
It's Ed.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.688
Ed's more of a man than you, Gary.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.864
(Vicky) The girls brought back

38:19.930 --> 38:23.334
a plethora of disgusting items
from the sex shop.

38:23.401 --> 38:26.103
They're such scruffy
fucking bastards.

38:26.170 --> 38:29.373
Vicky's standing on Ed.
What the fuck's that? Ed!

38:33.010 --> 38:36.981
Ed's got a hard-on for you. Oh,
thanks. Thanks, Ed. Good to know.

38:37.048 --> 38:42.420
To be honest,
Ed has no feelings, no heart,

38:42.486 --> 38:45.823
a constant hard-on
and is a little bit skinny.

38:45.890 --> 38:49.260
So he's Gaz. He's definitely
gonna keep Charlotte happy.

38:49.326 --> 38:51.529
She's been surviving on that
for ages.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.135
I don't get it, right.
Is it better to buck an ugly animal,

38:58.202 --> 39:01.906
like a proper creature,
just for the sake of the buck or...

39:01.972 --> 39:03.941
Have some standards.
Yeah, like.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.309
Somewhere in between.

39:05.376 --> 39:07.445
Girl who's got a bit about her,

39:07.511 --> 39:10.414
but obviously who's going for it
as well.

39:10.481 --> 39:13.317
You don't want someone
who's like shagging a plank.

39:13.384 --> 39:15.853
You don't want that.
(doorbell rings)

39:15.920 --> 39:18.255
I'll get it.
Go on, son.

39:25.796 --> 39:27.565
Hello. You all right?

39:28.632 --> 39:30.735
So, the doorbell goes
and it's Ricci.

39:30.801 --> 39:34.138
I've only known Ricci a short time,
but he's one of the boys.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.607
I'm buzzing to see him.
I'm happy he's back.

39:40.010 --> 39:42.213
The doorbell goes and it's Ricci.

39:43.481 --> 39:46.884
I didn't expect him and I've
got no idea what he's here to say.

39:46.951 --> 39:49.787
I've come back.
I love you all to bits.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.088
And...

39:51.155 --> 39:54.125
Me being in this house
and the relationship as well,

39:54.191 --> 39:55.526
it's just not right.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.962
Can't do our relationship any more.

39:58.028 --> 40:01.499
I love every single person
in this house like a family.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.134
Like brothers and sisters.

40:03.200 --> 40:07.037
I can't put me and her
through this any more.

40:07.104 --> 40:10.241
Taking myself out of the house
has given me time to think.

40:10.307 --> 40:14.278
Mine and Vicky's relationship is
more important than anything else.

40:14.345 --> 40:17.314
So, at this minute in time,
I'm gonna leave.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.885
Erm...

40:21.752 --> 40:24.321
I don't know whether I'll come back.

40:24.388 --> 40:26.657
I think that
when Ricci walked back in

40:26.724 --> 40:29.160
everyone thought the same thing.
He's back.

40:30.161 --> 40:32.997
To be told
the complete polar opposite to that

40:33.063 --> 40:35.466
hit everyone
like a ton of fucking bricks.

40:38.969 --> 40:41.806
Ricci's leaving.
He's not going to be coming back.

40:41.872 --> 40:43.741
And I'm sad to see him go.

40:43.808 --> 40:46.644
I'm sad to see
yet another person have to leave.

40:55.586 --> 40:59.690
Being back in Newcastle...
It's where me and Vicky first met.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.659
We've had so many ups and downs.

41:01.725 --> 41:03.661
So much of a rollercoaster.

41:03.727 --> 41:06.530
I wanna marry that girl.
I'm doing the right thing.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.575
I'm really sad to see Ricci go.

41:17.641 --> 41:18.976
At the end of the day,

41:19.043 --> 41:22.513
I've known him for so long now
and we've all been though a lot.

41:30.454 --> 41:34.091
But it's better for them.
Do you know what I mean?

41:34.158 --> 41:37.895
They couldn't keep going on
the way they were going on in here.

41:39.230 --> 41:41.966
Their relationship means
more to them than this.

41:42.032 --> 41:46.537
I will miss the kid. Everyone else
was running around chasing birds.

41:46.604 --> 41:48.138
I've got to know him.

41:48.205 --> 41:50.007
With Vicky still in the house,

41:50.074 --> 41:53.878
it's gonna give us the time apart
to think about things.

41:53.944 --> 41:56.647
And as much as I know
we're gonna stay together,

41:56.714 --> 41:58.749
it's right for her to stay in there.

41:58.816 --> 42:00.818
It's me that's got the problem.

42:00.885 --> 42:02.653
I want you to have fun, though.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.192
Want me to stay in without you?

42:09.326 --> 42:11.128
Obviously it's your decision.

42:14.932 --> 42:16.767
I just need to go sort this all out.

42:16.834 --> 42:18.269
This feels like...

42:20.371 --> 42:23.274
...a bit like a conclusion,
and I don't like that.

42:29.513 --> 42:32.349
This is the hardest decision
I've ever had to make.

42:32.416 --> 42:34.318
Leaving people that I love to bits

42:34.385 --> 42:36.987
and the woman
that I'm gonna end up marrying

42:37.054 --> 42:39.623
and I'm absolutely gutted.

42:46.230 --> 42:50.334
I can't believe that Ricci's left.

42:50.401 --> 42:53.037
I wish we was
still in the house together.

42:53.103 --> 42:56.006
I don't know how I'm gonna do
any of this without him.

42:56.073 --> 42:59.710
Everyone's so nice and so brilliant,
but they're not him.

43:06.984 --> 43:09.853
I'm not gonna lie.
I'm fucking shitting myself.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.323
(screams)
Fucking Joel turns up.

43:12.389 --> 43:14.658
Buck squad kicking off.

43:14.725 --> 43:15.926
We are going camping.

43:16.827 --> 43:18.228
Hi, boys.

43:18.295 --> 43:19.730
(all shout)

43:20.731 --> 43:23.867
The lads are gonna get eaten alive.

43:23.934 --> 43:25.069
I've got to win.

43:25.135 --> 43:26.537
£75!

43:26.603 --> 43:27.905
She's in me bed again.

43:27.972 --> 43:29.540
Is this a good idea?

43:29.606 --> 43:31.775
The feelings are
coming back for Gary.

43:32.910 --> 43:34.912
