Damn.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.447

We've got to discuss Lucca.

It's illegal.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.635
And Lucca's not saying anything.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.334
No, but she has the Marconi case
in two months,

02:40.377 --> 02:42.988
so if we're gonna make a change,
we have to make it now.

unknowns I'm not aware of.

What do you want,
a retainer or something? Mr. Kuzma,

03:29.383 --> 03:30.949

to a change in lawyer

So? That's what he does.
He gobbles up smaller firms.

No.

online today, Adrian,

I need with us.

Wilk Hobson committed suicide.

05:07.524 --> 05:10.353
Yes. Terrible.
But did you know

05:10.397 --> 05:13.487
that his partners don't agree
with the police assessment?

05:13.530 --> 05:15.358
They have reason to believe

05:15.402 --> 05:17.795
that it's one of these
copycat murders...

05:17.839 --> 05:20.624

killing another attorney.

05:20.668 --> 05:23.714

05:23.758 --> 05:25.542

05:25.586 --> 05:28.806

And now Wilk Hobson.

05:35.639 --> 05:38.947
We want you to attend our next meeting.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.775
But we're not one of the big six.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.473
True. But, Adrian, we saw you
on cable news last night,

05:43.517 --> 05:45.388
and we were impressed.

05:45.432 --> 05:48.739
We have agreed to invite
one more firm... yours.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.175
Uh, what are these meetings about?

05:50.219 --> 05:53.396
An existential threat to our livelihoods

05:53.440 --> 05:55.398
and our lives.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.705
Chicago lawyers are being killed,

05:57.748 --> 06:01.099
and the authorities are too busy
making lawyer jokes to help us.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.450
No one sympathizes,

06:03.493 --> 06:06.540
so it's up to us
to do for ourselves.

06:19.074 --> 06:21.511

on the news?

06:21.555 --> 06:23.121
I do not know.

06:23.165 --> 06:26.298
I... I thought
it was stupid.

06:26.342 --> 06:29.432
You were good.
You should take a look.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.869

for a long time.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.610

over their shoulders now, I...

06:33.654 --> 06:35.438
maybe that's a good thing.

to come back on?

08:02.960 --> 08:05.267
Do you think she will?
I...

08:05.310 --> 08:08.052
I think she wants to be
thought of as a lawyer,

08:31.119 --> 08:32.816
Yes, but not for this motion.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.470
You take it.
Why?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.254
Uh, because I'm a partner,
and you're an associate,

08:36.298 --> 08:37.604
and I want you to take it.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.693
Is this about Lucca's condition?

08:39.736 --> 08:41.695
No. It's about you
having a chance

08:41.738 --> 08:43.827
to be first chair.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.742
Does Lucca know?

08:45.786 --> 08:47.614
No.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.833
Go ahead and tell her.

No, I am the same.
Exactly the same.

09:06.937 --> 09:09.549
So, I'm hoping we can use
the DOJ's problems against them

09:09.592 --> 09:10.767
in this Marconi continuance.

It's my business.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.101
It is. You're right.
It is your business.

09:40.144 --> 09:43.278
But you haven't even told me,
and I'm your friend.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.589
I'm pregnant.
I'm having a baby.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.242
Congratulations.

09:51.286 --> 09:53.070
Thank you.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.290
Now, part of it was
just having those words

09:55.333 --> 09:57.466
come out of my mouth.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.120
It feels weird.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.948
Well, you know what,
you spoke them well.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.732
Hmm.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.517
Here's the other worry.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.781
I'm on the partner track.

10:07.824 --> 10:11.436
For the first time in my career,
I have some traction.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.615
And now I'm worried
they'll use...

10:15.658 --> 10:17.225
this to penalize me.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.967
They can't. Legally.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.622
Well, look, it's gonna be easier
for them to hold you back

10:22.665 --> 10:24.319
if you don't tell them.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.626
Then they can just say
it's all about performance.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.280
You should get your pregnancy
on the record.

10:29.324 --> 10:32.675
That's a good point.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.417
Then tell them.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.813
And here we are, again.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.598
Ms. Lutz.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.121
How are you?

10:44.165 --> 10:47.037
Every time a new lawyer
is killed, I think of you.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.083
And every time a new killer is arrested,

10:49.126 --> 10:50.127
I think about you.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.476
[chuckles]

10:51.520 --> 10:54.566
So much in common.
Ready to spar?

10:54.610 --> 10:57.134
SHERIFF: All rise.
Hear ye, hear ye.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.833
This branch of the
Circuit Court of Cook County

10:59.876 --> 11:02.139
is now in session,
pursuant to adjournment.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.619
The Honorable...

11:03.663 --> 11:05.534
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.231
Please.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.846
Now, let me prepare you
for what you're about to see.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.718
Trials are nothing like
what is shown on television.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.851
Justice is slow.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.331
Nothing is ever wrapped up
in 60 minutes here.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.637
Now, it's fine to enjoy

11:21.681 --> 11:24.727
TV lawyers,
but real-life lawyers

11:24.771 --> 11:26.424
hardly even go to court.

11:26.468 --> 11:30.298
In fact, 90% of a case
is just paperwork.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.779
90%...

11:32.822 --> 11:34.171
Hello.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.259
Who are you?

11:35.303 --> 11:36.826
Mr. Adrian Boseman.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.523
And Ms. Diane Lockhart.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.700
The defense moves
for substitution of counsel.

11:40.743 --> 11:43.006
Sidebar, please.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.965
This is an example of something

11:45.008 --> 11:46.662
you may have seen on television,

11:46.706 --> 11:49.273
where the lawyers request
something from the judge.

11:49.317 --> 11:52.450
But take my word,
it's not as interesting as TV.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.409
[laughter]
AMBER: Your Honor,

11:54.452 --> 11:56.106
the defendant wants
to disrupt the proceedings

11:56.150 --> 11:57.455
even before they've begun.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.980
Your Honor, Mr. Kuzma
has asked that

12:00.023 --> 12:02.069
we replace his earlier counsel.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.853
Now, the defendant
should be allowed...

12:03.897 --> 12:06.073
He was allowed
his representation of choice.

12:06.116 --> 12:08.771
He was.
Now he's changed his mind.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.033
The defendant can
choose his lawyers,

12:10.077 --> 12:11.469
but I will not allow this

12:11.513 --> 12:13.297
to turn into some game of musical chairs.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.951
Is that understood?
It is, Your Honor.

12:14.995 --> 12:17.737
Understood, Your Honor.
We move for a continuance.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.129
Of course you do.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.914
ADRIAN: Given that
we've just legally begun

12:20.957 --> 12:22.698
representing Mr. Kuzma,

12:22.742 --> 12:24.047
preparing properly for trial

12:24.091 --> 12:25.919
requires that we have at least...

12:25.962 --> 12:27.921
Plaintiff objects.
The jury's been seated.

12:27.964 --> 12:29.313
The trial's in progress.

12:29.357 --> 12:30.401
Sustained.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.925
How is it

12:31.968 --> 12:34.057
that so many lawyers
are being killed,

12:34.101 --> 12:36.320
and yet my courtroom
is still full of them?

12:36.364 --> 12:38.409
WOMAN: The fire took everything.

12:38.453 --> 12:42.152
The piano my mother left for me.

12:42.196 --> 12:45.068
My photo albums.
And this was your house,

12:45.112 --> 12:46.200
Mrs. Honeycutt?

12:46.243 --> 12:47.505
Yes.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.681
And this is your house
afterwards?

12:51.422 --> 12:53.337
Let the record reflect

12:53.381 --> 12:55.209
that Mrs. Honeycutt is
responding emotionally

12:55.252 --> 12:57.559
in the affirmative.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.996
Now, I'm sorry, Mrs. Honeycutt.
Just one more question.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.956
Is this your dog?

13:04.174 --> 13:05.262
[quietly]: Oh, God.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.524
HONEYCUTT: Yes.

13:06.568 --> 13:09.005
And he died in the fire,
didn't he?

13:09.049 --> 13:10.833
[voice breaking]: Yes.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.400
And who do you blame for this fire?

13:12.443 --> 13:14.184
Objection, Your Honor.
Inflammatory.

13:14.228 --> 13:15.403
Calls for a conclusion.

13:15.446 --> 13:16.708
Well, the conclusion is

13:16.752 --> 13:18.188
the point of this trial,
isn't it?

13:18.232 --> 13:20.625
I will, however, caution the jury.

13:22.671 --> 13:25.152
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

13:25.195 --> 13:28.329
a trial is never as
dramatic as it is on TV.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.897
We don't wrap things
up here in 60 minutes.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.987
So, just because a witness
points towards a defendant

13:34.030 --> 13:35.727
doesn't make it true.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.252
Please keep that in mind.

13:38.295 --> 13:39.906
Mrs. Honeycutt, you may continue.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.864
I blame him

13:41.908 --> 13:43.387
and his website.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.867
But he didn't light the match?

13:44.911 --> 13:47.087
No, but he published our home address,

13:47.130 --> 13:50.177
and he said we deserved
everything we got.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.874
That's the match.

13:51.918 --> 13:55.704
Thank you.
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Honeycutt.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.749
What was your dog's name?

14:00.013 --> 14:02.276
Puffy.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.452
Did you ever find Puffy?

14:04.495 --> 14:06.280
[sobs] No.

14:12.982 --> 14:15.028
She's trying to provoke you.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.421
Don't take the bait.
Mm-hmm.

14:17.465 --> 14:20.163
ADRIAN: Mrs. Honeycutt,

14:20.207 --> 14:22.600
I'm really sorry for your loss.

14:22.644 --> 14:26.517
Who is that sitting next to
Ms. Amber Wood Lutz?

14:26.561 --> 14:28.563
HONEYCUTT: That's my son, Dennis.

14:28.606 --> 14:31.305
And your son Dennis lives
with you, isn't that right?

14:31.348 --> 14:32.915
For the moment, yes.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.874
And he lived with you
in the house that was destroyed?

14:34.917 --> 14:37.267
He's been helping me
since I had my hip replaced.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.616
And your son Dennis

14:38.660 --> 14:39.879
is a neo-Nazi.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.011
Is that correct?
Objection! Inflammatory!

14:42.055 --> 14:43.795
The lady can say no
if it's not true, Your Honor.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.797
Even the question implies
a rationale for this fire.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.669
No, the question implies
a rationale for why my client

14:47.712 --> 14:49.453
printed these folks' address.
Your Honor.

14:49.497 --> 14:52.413
And that is all he is being sued for.
[gavel banging]

14:55.807 --> 14:57.766
[clears throat]

14:57.809 --> 14:59.681
Apologies for the fireworks.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.510
Occasionally things can get
a little out of hand here.

15:04.207 --> 15:05.600
Overruled.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.602
You may answer.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.473
My son is a good boy.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.998
He works hard,
and-and he reads a lot.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.653
And he is not a Nazi,
neo or otherwise.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.960
But wasn't he at
the Oak Woods protest

15:18.004 --> 15:20.093
at the Confederate soldier
statue, ma'am?

15:20.136 --> 15:21.094
Yes.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.313
But as a history buff.

15:23.357 --> 15:24.967
Is this Dennis's photo,
Mrs. Honeycutt?

15:25.011 --> 15:26.403
Yes.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.579
But he's yelling for everyone to stop.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.625
ADRIAN: Mrs. Honeycutt.

15:30.668 --> 15:34.150
Is this really the face of someone

15:34.194 --> 15:36.544
yelling to tell everyone to stop?

15:41.201 --> 15:43.246
$300,000.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.640
You didn't see what happened
in that courtroom?

15:45.683 --> 15:47.250
The jury loved her.

15:47.294 --> 15:50.384
Yes, but they hate her son.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.081
$300,000.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.040
That's enough to rebuild her home.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.998
Nope. $10.5 million.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.479
[elevator bell dings]
Pain and suffering.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
[lively chatter]

16:21.458 --> 16:23.808
DIANE: Jesus, it's everybody.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.637
ADRIAN: Everyone who never hired me.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.292
Oh, look. Elvis White.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.512
Mm. And Roger Woodruff.

16:31.555 --> 16:34.384
He defeated me twice in court.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.560
This is like the beginning
of that nightmare

16:36.604 --> 16:38.214
where I realize I'm naked.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.825
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.697
Adrian.
Franz.

16:42.740 --> 16:43.959
Franz, hello.Diane.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.352
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.223
We're all here.
Let's get started.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.747
Uh, no, thank you.
Thank you.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.880
Mm-hmm, Ms. Wood Lutz.

16:51.923 --> 16:54.578
ADRIAN: Looks like they're
pretending to be diverse.

16:54.622 --> 16:58.582
We're about to see why
jackals never meet.

I'm glad we're all
alive and kicking still.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.079
First order of business:

18:44.123 --> 18:46.081
We're asking everyone
to contribute $20,000

18:46.125 --> 18:47.996
to the fund for the widows
of our fallen peers.

18:48.039 --> 18:51.347
ARCHER: Let's not be stingy here.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.958
I think we can all spare $40,000.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.699
None of us are struggling.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.179
[others chuckle]
[clears throat]

18:57.223 --> 18:59.573
FRANZ: Well, let your conscience
guide your checkbook.

18:59.616 --> 19:02.793
The sad fact is we're having
to do for ourselves nowadays.

19:02.837 --> 19:05.709
In a world without guardrails,
we are the despised.

19:05.753 --> 19:09.235
And not to be too melodramatic,
we are also being hunted.

19:09.278 --> 19:10.975
"Not to be too melodramatic."

19:11.019 --> 19:13.848
What do you call it?
Three Chicago lawyers dead.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.154
By clients.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.720
While the authorities make jokes.

19:16.764 --> 19:18.505
Sometimes justifiably.
No.

19:18.548 --> 19:19.810
[others murmuring]
JONATHAN: What?

19:19.854 --> 19:21.551
What is the big hubbub about?
Wait a minute.

19:21.595 --> 19:22.987
Wait a minute, okay?
Who has handed over

19:23.031 --> 19:24.380
their client list to the police?

19:24.424 --> 19:26.165
Come on.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.819
Raise your hands.
Huh? No one.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.734
That's beside the point.
Attorney-client privilege

19:30.778 --> 19:32.127
prevents us... 
That's bullcrap.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.781
If we wanted to,
we could have a prosecutor

19:33.824 --> 19:35.304
subpoena those records in five minutes.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.045
The difficulty is...
Because nobody wants to.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.307
Wait. Wait.

19:38.351 --> 19:41.528
Difficulty is clients will leave us.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.182
If they know that 
we are handing their names

19:43.225 --> 19:44.487
over to the police... That's true.

19:44.531 --> 19:45.880
Even the innocent ones.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.012
No. No. No. The problem is us.

19:48.056 --> 19:50.319
We're worried
we'll poach from each other.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.929
It's not about clients leaving.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.409
It's about us stealing.

19:53.453 --> 19:54.758
Then what's the answer?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.369
The police are throwing this back at us,

19:56.412 --> 19:57.848
saying it's our problem.

19:57.892 --> 20:00.460
Remind them that we're not
some South Side squatters.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.984
Remind them of our tax base.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.855
Talk to Rahm.
Lay it out for him.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.335
He knows where
his money comes from.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.989
JONATHAN: That's right.
Rahm won't touch this.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.774
His deputy might.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.472
Warren Hesseman.
FRANZ: That's right.

20:12.515 --> 20:15.692
Warren just hinted that
he was running in 2019.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.694
He's gonna be looking
for trial lawyer money.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.261
He's also friends with the police.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.915
JONATHAN: Problem solved.
There you go.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.047
Good thought, Adrian.

20:23.091 --> 20:25.659
STUDIO TECH: Five minutes to air.

Five minutes to air.

So, you're back.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.668
Yeah. That's good.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.975
Just so we don't cross lines here, 
don't go angry on me.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.108
Wh... Um, one more time?

20:40.151 --> 20:43.546
[chuckles]
I'm the young, angry activist.

20:43.590 --> 20:46.419
You're the older...
Obama statesman.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.509
That's the only way they keep
two black pundits on the panel,

20:49.552 --> 20:51.293
if we both stick to our lanes.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.990
Huh.
Okay?

20:53.034 --> 20:55.471
[chuckles softly]

20:55.515 --> 20:58.169
It's good to have you on board, Adrian.

20:58.213 --> 21:01.303
That was fun last time.
Good viral clips.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.044
Keep it up.

21:03.087 --> 21:04.959
Thanks.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.963
[news theme music playing]

21:13.663 --> 21:16.231
As usual, we have our team
of legal experts

21:16.275 --> 21:18.538
giving us their perspective
for the week in law.

21:18.581 --> 21:19.974
And for the fourth week in a row,

21:20.017 --> 21:22.150
we turn to the bizarre
series of deaths

21:22.193 --> 21:24.718
tied to clients killing lawyers.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.285
Overnight, there was another murder.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.025
This one is still unsolved.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.984
A lawyer gunned down in her carport

21:30.027 --> 21:31.246
while walking her dog.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.682
Donna Evans,

21:32.726 --> 21:35.250
seen here representing
a vandalized mosque.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.644
Police suspect her boyfriend,

21:37.687 --> 21:39.907
but many think
it's another client killing.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.909
Your thoughts, Jedidiah?

21:41.952 --> 21:43.650
I think it's part of this
anti-Muslim hysteria

21:43.693 --> 21:45.260
led by Donald Trump, [Chuck laughs]

21:45.304 --> 21:47.088
Who made the Muslim ban
the cornerstone of his entire...

21:47.131 --> 21:49.046
Okay, not everything is racism.

21:49.090 --> 21:51.048
Everything that's racist is racism.
Okay, look.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.834
This-this woman dealt
with Islamic radicals.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.706
What was she thinking? Did she
have a death wish or something?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.665
It was a desecrated mosque, Chuck, 
not ISIS.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.362
Yes, but this lawyer was dealing,

22:00.406 --> 22:03.626
on a daily basis, with Islamic extremism.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.367
She should've known
what she was getting into.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.326
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

22:07.369 --> 22:08.283
Go ahead, Adrian.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.763
No. It's all right.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.156
No, I think I know
as much as you, sir.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.897
No, we're too quick
to coddle extremists

22:13.941 --> 22:16.770
in the name of open borders
and globalization.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.729
But these are real people
you're talking about, Chuck.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.427
I knew Donna Evans.

22:21.470 --> 22:22.863
She was a great lawyer.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.082
She did more good in her short life

22:25.126 --> 22:26.083
than you ever will.
[Chuck laughs]

22:26.127 --> 22:27.868
CHUCK: I'm not
out there defending

22:27.911 --> 22:29.696
Islamic radicals.
No, you're in here,

22:29.739 --> 22:33.743
being paid $170,000 a year
to ignorantly yap

22:33.787 --> 22:35.789
your mouth off, Chuck.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.271
How dare you?

22:40.315 --> 22:42.535
Now, how much do you
make as a lawyer?

22:42.578 --> 22:46.495
Don't play all high and mighty with me.

22:46.539 --> 22:50.020
So you're coming after
my job, now, huh?

22:50.064 --> 22:51.979
We'll see who wins.

22:53.981 --> 22:57.419
I probably should've mentioned
the one rule of cable news.

22:57.463 --> 23:00.422
Don't ever, ever, ever mention money.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.424
Yep.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.687
It was nice meeting you.

23:11.607 --> 23:12.739
Adrian.

23:12.782 --> 23:14.393
Good morning.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.046
[clears throat]

23:16.090 --> 23:18.353
[elevator doors close]

23:18.397 --> 23:20.181
Well, that was interesting.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.661
Which part?

23:21.704 --> 23:24.011
The $170,000 a year part.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.622
Is that really how much he's paid?

23:26.666 --> 23:28.319
I lost it, didn't I?

23:28.363 --> 23:30.887
No, I've seen you lose it.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.803
That was intentional.
[chuckles]

23:33.847 --> 23:36.458
My innate sense of drama. Oh.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.460
Hmm. Yeah.

23:42.682 --> 23:45.162
I'm sorry.
I-I never do this,

23:45.206 --> 23:47.469
but you're the guy from cable news, right?

23:47.513 --> 23:50.167
My mom could not stop
talking about you last night.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.039
Could you sign something for her?

23:52.082 --> 23:53.649
Her name's Eunice.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.825
AMBER: The defense has
called you a Nazi, Dennis.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.348
Are you?

23:57.392 --> 23:58.915
No, ma'am.You were present

23:58.959 --> 24:01.788
at the demonstration
at Oak Woods Cemetery,

24:01.831 --> 24:05.008
in which it has been alleged
there were neo-Nazis present.

24:05.052 --> 24:07.010
I was there to honor
the Confederate soldiers

24:07.054 --> 24:08.969
who were imprisoned and died.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.188
It's been charged that
the demonstration

24:11.232 --> 24:14.017
you were a part of,
has, at its purpose,

24:14.061 --> 24:17.934
to intimidate various
racial and ethnic groups.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.154
It wasn't mypurpose.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.983
Well, I... I just don't want
to lose our history.

24:23.026 --> 24:26.160
Not because it's perfect.
It's not.

24:26.203 --> 24:29.859
Those Confederate dead
share the same cemetery

24:29.903 --> 24:32.906
as Jesse Owens and Harold Washington.

24:32.949 --> 24:35.125
And we should have to think about that. 
AMBER: I see.

24:35.169 --> 24:36.736
And did you come to a point...

24:36.779 --> 24:39.434
I think you should take this.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.523
What?
The jury.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.047
The whole testimony,
they're watching you.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.441
TV does that to people.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.877
AMBER: Thank you, Dennis.

24:47.921 --> 24:50.140
[quietly]: Jesus. God.No further questions.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.229
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Go for it.

24:52.273 --> 24:53.840
ADRIAN: Mr. Honeycutt.

24:53.883 --> 24:55.842
[clears throat]

24:55.885 --> 24:59.367
So, you were aware that there
were Nazis at the demonstration,

24:59.410 --> 25:03.240
but you yourself are not a Nazi?

25:03.284 --> 25:04.459
Not at all.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.548
You are one of the "very fine people"

25:06.592 --> 25:08.594
that the president referred to?

25:08.637 --> 25:09.943
Object to

25:09.986 --> 25:11.945
the sarcasm, Your Honor.

25:11.988 --> 25:13.990
It's a direct quote, Your Honor.
Sustained nonetheless.

25:14.034 --> 25:16.427
According to your Facebook page,

25:16.471 --> 25:20.475
Mr. Honeycutt,
you are a Civil War reenactor?

25:20.519 --> 25:21.998
Uh, yes, sir.

25:22.042 --> 25:24.523
And you put up a post...
an angry post...

25:24.566 --> 25:27.395
about the uniforms that some
of the reenactors were wearing.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.397
When you wear Velcro

25:29.440 --> 25:31.007
at the Battle of Chickamauga,

25:31.051 --> 25:32.922
you're showing a lack of respect.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.794
Since you take uniforms
so seriously,

25:34.837 --> 25:37.927
tell us about the uniform
that you were wearing

25:37.971 --> 25:39.450
at the demonstration
you attended.

25:39.494 --> 25:41.888
I wasn't wearing any uniform.

25:41.931 --> 25:45.805
White polo and khaki pants, like
most of the other young men.

25:45.848 --> 25:47.328
AMBER: Objection.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.025
So did the salespeople at the mall.

25:49.069 --> 25:50.984
Argumentative.
I will sustain that.

25:51.027 --> 25:54.553
Are you familiar with a website
called The Mighty Hammer?

25:54.596 --> 25:56.598
I've heard of it.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.208
ADRIAN: You've heard of it.

25:58.252 --> 26:01.211
"Put away your brown shirts
and swastika armbands.

26:01.255 --> 26:04.258
"Wehrmacht of today requires
that the State

26:04.301 --> 26:07.435
"not be able to pick us out.

26:07.478 --> 26:13.006
Khaki pants and white polo shirts only."

26:13.049 --> 26:15.922
When I got dressed, I wasn't
thinking about any of that.

26:15.965 --> 26:19.708
Also, I-I don't own
any swastika armbands,

26:19.752 --> 26:21.188
and I don't much appreciate

26:21.231 --> 26:22.755
being lumped in with people who do.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.408
Or being lumped in with
people at the mall.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.106
[laughter]
AMBER: Your Honor.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.716
Mr. Boseman,

26:27.760 --> 26:29.718
please dial back your sarcasm.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.372
Certainly, Your Honor.

26:31.415 --> 26:35.028
Mr. Honeycutt, if I have
mischaracterized your beliefs,

26:35.071 --> 26:36.551
I'm sorry.

26:36.595 --> 26:41.425
It's just that
we were able to retrieve...

26:41.469 --> 26:45.125
some writings,
postings of yours from 2012,

26:45.168 --> 26:46.822
which you subsequently deleted.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.737
I'd like to read some now, Your Honor.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.739
Objection, Your Honor.
Prejudicial.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.741
That was six years ago.The witness is

26:52.785 --> 26:54.700
free to disavow, Your Honor.
Overruled.

26:54.743 --> 26:57.441
"We make ourselves
too easy of a target

26:57.485 --> 26:59.487
wearing the Hakenkreuz."

26:59.530 --> 27:02.446
That's like the white hood of the Klan.

27:02.490 --> 27:06.363
"We should let those now
in power forget that we exist.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.844
"The Jew's busy making money,

27:08.888 --> 27:12.369
"the homosexual's busy
contaminating the culture,

27:12.413 --> 27:15.111
"and the Ethiopian is too stupid

27:15.155 --> 27:18.375
to recognize what we represent."

27:18.419 --> 27:19.725
I don't believe that.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.640
But you believed it then?
No. No.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.032
I was just quoting other people.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.687
It was just a... a pose.
It was just to provoke.

27:25.731 --> 27:29.430
ADRIAN: Provoke? 
Provoke people like, uh, Jews?

27:29.473 --> 27:31.650
Provoke people like homosexuals?
And provoke blacks?

27:31.693 --> 27:33.608
No! I never, I never meant it!

27:33.652 --> 27:35.697
I didn't believe it!

27:35.741 --> 27:37.481
I-I would like a short recess, Your Honor.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.658
ADRIAN: Fine.

27:39.701 --> 27:43.009
The witness probably needs
a new disguise anyhow.

27:43.052 --> 27:44.445
[applause]

27:46.752 --> 27:49.189
[indistinct chatter,
phones ringing in distance]

27:49.232 --> 27:52.192
MARISSA: They should be here in a minute.

27:52.235 --> 27:53.497
You all right?

27:53.541 --> 27:56.892
Yeah. Why?

27:56.936 --> 28:00.243
No reason. 
Just asking.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.160
I'm pregnant.

28:04.204 --> 28:06.162
Congratulations.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.077
I'm telling everyone now.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.557
Okay. I'll throw you a shower.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.515
No. Please. Don't.

28:11.559 --> 28:12.647
Too late.

28:12.691 --> 28:16.129
No, seriously. 
I hate showers.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.435
Well, this'll be a new, hip one.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.263
With a stripper.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.396
DIANE: Lucca, sorry to keep you waiting.

28:22.439 --> 28:24.311
Come on in.

28:27.575 --> 28:30.099
Thank you for the meeting.

28:30.143 --> 28:33.973
I wanted to officially inform
the partners of my pregnancy.

28:34.016 --> 28:36.149
Oh! Ah! 
[Laughs]You may have wondered

28:36.192 --> 28:37.759
why I haven't yet told anyone.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.022
It was only to prepare
some contingencies.

28:40.066 --> 28:41.676
DIANE: Uh, may we interrupt?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.243
Yeah, of course.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.853
Congratulations! Congratulations!

28:44.897 --> 28:46.333
[laughing] 
You look wonderful.

28:48.552 --> 28:50.032
Thank you.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.817
[clears throat]

28:51.860 --> 28:54.733
Uh, the birth date is scheduled
for May 22.

28:54.776 --> 28:57.387
I'll be back at my desk on May 25,

28:57.431 --> 28:59.389
having missed only three work days,

28:59.433 --> 29:01.217
none of which are in court.

29:01.261 --> 29:04.003
All medical appointments
will be before 9:00 a.m.

29:04.046 --> 29:06.005
All at-home child care
is lined up.

29:06.048 --> 29:10.618
I'm not asking for, nor do
I need, any special allowances.

29:10.661 --> 29:13.142
I can and will continue
my full workload.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.970
With no interruptions.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.973
And I'm especially eager
to resume first chair

29:18.017 --> 29:20.410
on the Marconi
double murder case,

29:20.454 --> 29:23.239
having worked on it for a year.

29:23.283 --> 29:26.808
Well, uh, as the, uh,
father of six, [chuckles]

29:26.852 --> 29:31.770
I'd like to bring up the...
fullness of the task.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.336
Noted.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.251
DIANE: And I would like to acknowledge,

29:35.295 --> 29:38.080
in accordance with the law,
that we are behind your plan.

29:38.124 --> 29:40.126
So go to it.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.522
Oh, how'd it go?

29:47.742 --> 29:50.266
So what do we think?

29:50.310 --> 29:53.226
I don't think
we can think, legally.

29:53.269 --> 29:55.837
We just have to react.

29:55.881 --> 29:59.275
So, we'll react
to how she does in court.

29:59.319 --> 30:03.149
Yeah. And keep Maia
ready to step in.

30:08.110 --> 30:11.157
FRANZ: I want to welcome Warren
Hesseman, deputy to the mayor.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.681
I should say up front, 
I'm a trial lawyer's best friend.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.335
Now more than ever, we need 'em.

30:15.378 --> 30:17.424
They're our guardrails.
FRANZ: Then we need you

30:17.467 --> 30:19.165
to be intermediary with the police.

30:19.208 --> 30:21.558
They are not taking
these murders seriously.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.909
It may look that way from the outside, 
but that's not true.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.911
[murmurs of dissent]

30:25.954 --> 30:28.739
Wilk Hobson did not commit
suicide. I knew him.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.176
He was getting angry phone calls.

30:30.219 --> 30:31.742
Then the police
will investigate.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.093
They already investigated.
They called it a suicide.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.616
That was an unofficial statement.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.139
Look, Warren, we don't think

30:37.183 --> 30:39.707
the police are taking
these cases seriously.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.578
What do we have to do?

30:41.622 --> 30:43.276
I'll bring your concerns to them.
Ugh!

30:43.319 --> 30:44.799
[others grumbling]

30:44.843 --> 30:46.975
But... but I need your help.

30:47.019 --> 30:49.369
Ah, now we get the solicitation.

30:49.412 --> 30:52.633
No. The police, whether
rightly or wrongly,

30:52.676 --> 30:56.898
see you as the enemy because
sometimes, frankly, you are.

30:56.942 --> 30:59.205
How are we the enemy?
You sue them.

30:59.248 --> 31:02.773
Of course we sue them.
It keeps the police honest.

31:02.817 --> 31:05.385
Some firms make it their
mission to sue the police.

31:05.428 --> 31:06.734
Stop beating around the bush.

31:06.777 --> 31:08.388
There's only one firm at this table

31:08.431 --> 31:10.172
responsible for 60% of the lawsuits

31:10.216 --> 31:11.652
against the police.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.915
Every single one of them was justified.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.830
No one's denying that,
but it's the provocation

31:15.874 --> 31:17.832
that sets the police against you.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.486
The victims are the problem?

31:19.529 --> 31:21.488
The police should be sued
when they do wrong.

31:21.531 --> 31:24.665
But sometimes they don't do wrong, 
and they still get sued.

31:24.708 --> 31:27.189
It's making the dialogue
with the police much harder.

31:27.233 --> 31:28.887
We don't want the police to be our friends.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.324
We just want them to do
their fucking job.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.282
FRANZ: Okay, let's leave it there, Warren.

31:33.326 --> 31:35.154
Anything you can do for us,

31:35.197 --> 31:38.897
we ask that you do, and we'll
see what we can do for you.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.724
It's none of their business what we do

31:40.768 --> 31:42.639
with our police brutality cases!

31:42.683 --> 31:44.728
And that's what we told them.
Then why bring it up here? Why?

31:44.772 --> 31:47.818
Sharing with you how we're being
perceived. That's all, Julius.

31:47.862 --> 31:51.170
So, what, the police will only do their job

31:51.213 --> 31:54.477
if we drop our police brutality cases?

31:54.521 --> 31:57.176
Warren Hesseman suggested
that we tread lightly.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.612
I'm not saying we will.

31:58.655 --> 31:59.961
You're telling us about it.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.224
How can that not have
a chilling effect?

32:02.268 --> 32:03.965
Would it be better
if we didn't tell you anything?

32:04.009 --> 32:05.401
No, it would be better
if we dropped out

32:05.445 --> 32:06.968
of the Big Six conference.

32:07.012 --> 32:09.014
We've only been invited
because it pressures us

32:09.057 --> 32:10.711
into dropping our
police brutality cases.

32:10.754 --> 32:13.192
I disagree.
We have a seat at the table.

32:13.235 --> 32:15.716
We are sitting with the Big Six!

32:15.759 --> 32:18.501
It's worth all the fucking
irritation in the world!

32:18.545 --> 32:20.939
They ask us to do something
that we don't want to do,

32:20.982 --> 32:23.985
we just say no.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.770
Is this you talking
or the pundit?

32:29.991 --> 32:32.689
LUCCA: The defense moves

32:32.733 --> 32:35.866
to exclude the testimony of Dr.
William Brentwood, Your Honor.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.651
JUDGE: Uh-huh.

32:37.694 --> 32:43.178
So, is this pretrial motion
number 234 or 235?

32:43.222 --> 32:45.659
Yes, it sure does seem that way,
doesn't it, Your Honor?

32:45.702 --> 32:48.444
Yes. I'm not buttered up,
Counselor.

32:48.488 --> 32:52.100
There have been just as many
prosecutorial motions.

32:52.144 --> 32:54.668
So who is this Dr. Brentwood?

32:54.711 --> 32:56.583
The expert witness
the prosecution will call

32:56.626 --> 32:58.106
to discuss the blood spatter evidence.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.542
If I may, Your Honor?

32:59.586 --> 33:01.109
I'm not finished with my motion.

33:01.153 --> 33:02.806
And we again ask that the prosecution

33:02.850 --> 33:04.634
release its discovery to us.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.549
This is getting dangerously
close to a Brady violation.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.595
I have a motion that takes precedence.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.901
Procedural, not evidentiary. 
You should have brought it up earlier.

33:10.945 --> 33:14.166
You're so quick to step in that
I wasn't given the opportunity.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.907
Oh, well,
you two are really something.

33:16.951 --> 33:19.519
What's the motion,
Mr. Morrello?

33:19.562 --> 33:21.869
A continuance, Your Honor.
Another?

33:21.912 --> 33:24.437
The prosecution moves

33:24.480 --> 33:28.267
to reschedule the trial to
start the week of May 21.

33:28.310 --> 33:30.356
Your Honor, that's absurd.

33:30.399 --> 33:32.401
The prosecution is proposing
a four-month delay.

33:32.445 --> 33:34.186
"Absurd's" a little strong.

33:34.229 --> 33:37.406
A few weeks is hardly uncommon
in a case this complicated.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.800
This motion denies our client
his constitutionally-mandated

33:39.843 --> 33:42.281
right to a speedy trial.

33:42.324 --> 33:45.110
A few months is not a speedy
trial violation, Your Honor.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.112
Okay. This was fun.

33:47.155 --> 33:49.940
I want the two of you
to go out into the hall,

33:49.984 --> 33:52.639
pull out your calendars
and decide on a date.

33:52.682 --> 33:56.295
Come back here in an hour,
and I'll hear your proposal.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.127
You are taking advantage
of this situation.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.824
I'm not taking
advantage of anything.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.260
I'm prosecuting a case.

34:07.871 --> 34:10.396
Take the next one.

34:12.485 --> 34:15.705
You asked for the trial to start
the same week this baby is due,

34:15.748 --> 34:17.402
and that's not taking advantage?

34:17.446 --> 34:19.795
I picked dates that are
convenient for the prosecution,

34:19.840 --> 34:21.188
ignoring your pregnancy,

34:21.233 --> 34:23.757
which is what you seem
to expect us all to do.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.846
Oh, my God, I get it.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.065
You want to argue against Maia.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.024
What? 
You know she's inexperienced.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.721
That's what this is about.

34:31.764 --> 34:34.027
Okay, could you please drop
the conspiracy theories?

34:34.072 --> 34:36.291
There's nothing nefarious here.

34:44.212 --> 34:45.822
[phone vibrates]

34:45.866 --> 34:47.824
Hi. Do you mind
if I sit here?

34:47.868 --> 34:49.435
I have to get
right back to work.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.784
No, go ahead.
I'm in a rush, too.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.786
God, I hate working
at a law firm.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.094
Ugh. Tell me about it. Where are you at?

34:56.137 --> 34:58.052
Uh, Mendelssohn, Grant
and Associates.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.793
Oh, yeah.
I heard that was hard.

34:59.836 --> 35:01.186
Which lawyer?

35:01.229 --> 35:02.926
Franz Mendelssohn.
Wow.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.190
The top guy.
A lot of clients.

35:05.233 --> 35:08.236
You just signed
someone new, didn't you?

35:08.280 --> 35:10.020
Uh, who do you mean?

35:10.064 --> 35:11.848
Oh, someone... Ugh.

35:11.892 --> 35:13.633
I saw the paperwork.

35:13.676 --> 35:16.157
Is it someone with the Chicago P.D.?

35:16.201 --> 35:17.898
Yeah, their civil cases.

35:17.941 --> 35:21.467
We don't have it yet,
but we're trying.

35:21.510 --> 35:23.208
Yeah, that must be it.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.035
Which firm are you with?

35:25.079 --> 35:27.647
Pinwheel, Winkler and Associates.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.170
Pinwheel, Winkler.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.737
I-I don't think 
I've ever heard of them.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.608
Oh, we're just starting out.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.436
Oh.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.134
I better go.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.527
Good luck with Chicago P.D.Thanks.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.401
[dialing]

35:42.444 --> 35:44.316
Diane.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.187
There's something with 
Franz Mendelssohn you should know.

35:46.231 --> 35:49.059
Seriously?

35:49.103 --> 35:52.019
That's great, Marissa.
Fantastic work.

35:52.062 --> 35:54.021
Okay, talk to you later.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.937
[laughter]
ADRIAN: Right?

35:56.980 --> 35:58.547
AMBER: Your Honor!

35:58.591 --> 36:00.419
The defense has rolled its eyes.

36:00.462 --> 36:02.160
Unintended, Your Honor.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.684
Sometimes my eyes have
a mind of their own.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.816
[laughter]
JUDGE: Mr. Boseman.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.254
Refrain from all visual commentary.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.907
Of course, Your Honor.

36:10.951 --> 36:13.997
Let me ask another question,
uh, Mr. Kuzma.

36:14.041 --> 36:16.261
Uh, one more to the plaintiff's liking.

36:16.304 --> 36:19.960
Why did you print 
the plaintiff's name and address?

36:20.003 --> 36:21.440
'Cause I hate Nazis.

36:21.483 --> 36:24.007
And I really hate Nazis
marching in the streets.

36:24.051 --> 36:28.360
Do I intentionally inflict
emotional distress?

36:28.403 --> 36:30.318
I sure hope so.

36:30.362 --> 36:31.798
ADRIAN: Mr. Kuzma,

36:31.841 --> 36:34.844
where did you find
Dennis Honeycutt's address?

36:34.888 --> 36:37.238
Oh, it's in the phone book.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.849
It's in the phone book?

36:39.893 --> 36:42.156
KUZMA: Yes. So isn't it just as likely

36:42.200 --> 36:46.987
that the arsonists found
the address in the phone book?

36:47.030 --> 36:48.728
Objection.
Beyond the scope.

36:48.771 --> 36:50.686
I can see why you wouldn't want

36:50.730 --> 36:52.297
that question answered.
[gavel bangs]

36:52.340 --> 36:55.082
I'd like all the lawyers in my chambers.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.345
Why, Your Honor?
Because I said so!

37:00.218 --> 37:01.915
Enough showboating, Mr. Boseman.

37:01.958 --> 37:04.396
Excuse me?

37:04.439 --> 37:06.963
Don't play coy with me.
You are playing to the jury.

37:07.007 --> 37:10.271
Your Honor, I am simply...

37:10.315 --> 37:12.273
Yes, actually, I am.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.362
I am playing our case
to the jury.

37:14.406 --> 37:16.277
That's my job.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.279
Watch your tone, sir.
AMBER: He's trading on

37:18.323 --> 37:19.628
his punditry, Your Honor.

37:19.672 --> 37:20.760
No, I am being an advocate.

37:20.803 --> 37:21.935
JUDGE: It is posturing.

37:21.978 --> 37:24.633
And I will not allow that
in my courtroom.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.722
I don't care how many times

37:26.766 --> 37:28.550
you've been on television,
Mr. Boseman.

37:28.594 --> 37:31.988
Leave it outside my court.

37:32.032 --> 37:33.990
Your Honor, could you point out

37:34.034 --> 37:36.123
what Mr. Boseman
should do differently?

37:36.166 --> 37:37.733
Excuse me?

37:37.777 --> 37:40.997
What is he doing that
he should do differently?

37:41.041 --> 37:42.782
He should stop playing to the jury.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.044
Should he stop looking at the jury?

37:44.087 --> 37:45.654
That is not what I'm saying.

37:45.698 --> 37:47.265
DIANE: Should he remain seated?
[sighs]

37:47.308 --> 37:49.441
No. He knows what he's doing.

37:49.484 --> 37:51.399
Your Honor,
what Mr. Boseman is doing

37:51.443 --> 37:53.488
is being an effective advocate

37:53.532 --> 37:55.403
for our client.

37:55.447 --> 37:58.972
You are asking him
to change his behavior

37:59.015 --> 38:02.280
without telling him how
to change, so I-I must object.

38:02.323 --> 38:03.368
To what?

38:03.411 --> 38:07.720
To your order that Mr. Boseman

38:07.763 --> 38:11.027
stop effectively representing our client.

38:11.071 --> 38:14.379
That is not what my order requires.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.032
Well, then you sustain our objection?

38:16.076 --> 38:18.992
No. Well, then I'd like
a ruling, Your Honor.

38:19.035 --> 38:20.646
To quote a lawyer that I respected,

38:20.689 --> 38:23.039
"I want a ruling
that I can appeal."

38:23.083 --> 38:26.260
Well, then try this one
on for size. Overruled.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.044
Thank you, Your Honor.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.046
You two have
a winnable case here.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.875
I don't know why you're doing
everything you can to lose it.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.877
Because you're trying to tie
one hand behind our back.

38:34.921 --> 38:36.531
And the jury is going to know that.

38:36.575 --> 38:37.967
Is there anything else, Your Honor?

38:38.011 --> 38:39.534
Yes. 
Get out.

38:39.578 --> 38:41.406
Thank you.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.888
Wow.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.803
I thought
I was the troublemaker.

38:47.847 --> 38:51.546
[chuckles] Wait till you hear
what Marissa found out.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.243
ADRIAN: What do you got?

38:53.287 --> 38:56.072
Your new friend Mendelssohn,
he's playing you.

38:58.858 --> 39:02.122
We have no news 
on the police investigation,

39:02.165 --> 39:04.385
but I do want to discuss and review

39:04.429 --> 39:07.083
the meeting we had with Mr. Hesseman.

39:07.127 --> 39:08.563
What is there to discuss?
He threw everything

39:08.607 --> 39:10.217
right back at us.
I don't think that's true.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.872
He had, I think, 
a very constructive suggestion.

39:12.915 --> 39:13.873
Which was?

39:13.916 --> 39:15.831
That our police brutality cases

39:15.875 --> 39:17.572
against the department are

39:17.616 --> 39:20.053
a thorn in all our sides.

39:20.096 --> 39:23.578
Not in the number of them,
but in the-the scope of them,

39:23.622 --> 39:26.407
the-the fury of them.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.627
Not us.
We don't have cases.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.280
FRANZ: Adrian, do
you have something

39:30.324 --> 39:31.369
to contribute?

39:31.412 --> 39:33.936
No.

39:33.980 --> 39:36.069
ARCHER: We're here to try to work
together as a group, Adrian.

39:36.112 --> 39:38.114
When you throw a bomb at
the police department,

39:38.158 --> 39:39.855
we all feel it.

39:39.899 --> 39:41.553
You don't think there's any call
to change your culture?

39:44.207 --> 39:48.081
Not until you drop your new client, Franz.

39:48.124 --> 39:50.388
My new client?
I don't understand. Two months ago,

39:50.431 --> 39:53.478
you shopped yourself 
to the Chicago Police Department,

39:53.521 --> 39:55.349
arguing you could reduce their liability.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.611
That's not true.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.047
Are you saying it's not true

39:58.091 --> 40:00.006
that the Chicago Police Department

40:00.049 --> 40:03.009
is thinking of taking 
its business to your firm?

40:03.052 --> 40:05.533
No, I'm saying my solicitation
has nothing to do with

40:05.577 --> 40:07.230
this working group's
dealings with the police.

40:07.274 --> 40:08.623
There's a Chinese wall.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.756
[laughs loudly]

40:10.799 --> 40:12.758
Is this fucking true, Franz?

40:12.801 --> 40:16.196
You've been trying to talk them
into going easy on police cases

40:16.239 --> 40:17.719
so you could win yourself
a department contract?

40:17.763 --> 40:19.417
No, this has nothing to do with my...

40:19.460 --> 40:21.810
JONATHAN: Of course it has
everything to do with it!

40:21.854 --> 40:24.683
FRANZ: No one here would believe
that I would stoop so low

40:24.726 --> 40:27.163
to use this group for
my own advantage!

40:27.207 --> 40:28.861
I believe it.

40:28.904 --> 40:30.123
I guess I do, too.

40:30.166 --> 40:31.341
I believe it, too.[murmurs of agreement]

40:31.385 --> 40:33.605
Excuse us.
Thank you.

40:33.648 --> 40:36.434
ARCHER: Oh, boy, oh, boy.
AMBER: How disappointing.

40:43.092 --> 40:45.834
Well, you seem ready to go,
Ms. Quinn.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.488
What have you two decided?

40:47.532 --> 40:49.925
Your Honor, we couldn't
come to an agreement.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.187
[sighs]

40:51.231 --> 40:53.102
We didn't come to an agreement
because the date

40:53.146 --> 40:56.279
the AUSA is insisting on for this trial

40:56.323 --> 40:58.630
coincides with the due date of my baby.

40:58.673 --> 41:00.327
Congratulations.

41:00.370 --> 41:02.155
Thank you.

41:02.198 --> 41:05.332
Did you explain your situation to the AUSA?

41:05.375 --> 41:06.812
No.

41:06.855 --> 41:08.074
Because there's no need.

41:08.117 --> 41:10.076
He already knows the due date.

41:10.119 --> 41:13.035
He's the father.

41:13.079 --> 41:14.123
Huh.

41:14.167 --> 41:15.777
That's right, Your Honor.

41:15.821 --> 41:20.086
The AUSA is trying to use what
he knows about my situation...

41:20.129 --> 41:22.436
i.e. knocking me up...
to his advantage.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.091
Uh, uh, Your Honor...
[stammers] He wants me off the case

41:25.134 --> 41:27.093
because that'll give him
a better chance of winning.

41:27.136 --> 41:29.051
That's...

41:29.095 --> 41:30.792
[sighs]

41:30.836 --> 41:34.492
Mr. Morrello, it's your turn.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.494
Share your thinking.

41:36.537 --> 41:39.497
I asked for the...

41:39.540 --> 41:42.325
Your Honor...
[clears throat]

41:42.369 --> 41:44.632
I asked for the continuance

41:44.676 --> 41:46.634
because we,
the Department of Justice,

41:46.678 --> 41:48.984
need more time to prepare our case.
[chuckles]

41:50.856 --> 41:52.074
[clears throat]

41:52.118 --> 41:54.250
Many of our attorneys have resigned,

41:54.294 --> 41:58.080
and I have inherited this case 
from an outgoing AUSA.

41:58.124 --> 41:59.560
What Ms. Quinn is suggesting...

41:59.604 --> 42:01.519
Oh, go ahead and call me Lucca.

42:01.562 --> 42:04.304
The judge knows 
we're on a first-name basis.

42:05.348 --> 42:07.394
She's right.

42:07.437 --> 42:09.831
What Lucca...

42:09.875 --> 42:12.399
is suggesting is incredibly cynical,

42:12.442 --> 42:13.966
not to mention hypocritical,

42:14.009 --> 42:16.577
because now she's using her pregnancy

42:16.621 --> 42:20.233
to win sympathy from you, Your Honor.

42:20.276 --> 42:23.802
Yes, I noticed.

42:23.845 --> 42:26.456
Oh, boy, this kid's gonna have 
great parents.

42:26.500 --> 42:29.459
Okay. [Clears throat]
Here goes.

42:29.503 --> 42:31.549
No continuance.

42:31.592 --> 42:33.551
Mr. Morrello,

42:33.594 --> 42:37.293
no one can know your true reason
for moving the trial date,

42:37.337 --> 42:41.254
but it doesn't look good,
and I'm not going to indulge it.

42:41.297 --> 42:44.257
Get your case ready.
You're going to trial.

42:44.300 --> 42:47.434
And, Ms. Quinn,

42:47.477 --> 42:49.392
your pregnancy
is not going to earn you

42:49.436 --> 42:51.873
any special dispensation
at trial.

42:51.917 --> 42:54.223
So, you'd better get ready, too.

42:54.267 --> 42:56.225
COLIN: I wasn't trying to get you

42:56.269 --> 42:57.531
kicked off the case.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.446
Excuse me.
Do you have an appointment?

42:59.489 --> 43:01.187
I wasn't being strategic
in court.

43:01.230 --> 43:04.016
I wasn't trying
to get you bumped from the case.

43:04.059 --> 43:08.063
Then what were you doing?
Go over there and turn around.

43:08.107 --> 43:09.674
We're having a baby.

43:09.717 --> 43:11.545
I'm having a baby.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.939
COLIN: The continuance was
for your benefit.Oh, my God.

43:13.982 --> 43:16.637
I didn't think this could get
any worse, but here we go.

43:16.681 --> 43:19.248
This trial is going
to be very stressful.

43:19.292 --> 43:20.728
Okay?
A double murder.

43:20.772 --> 43:22.730
A-And we're gonna be
screaming at each other.

43:22.774 --> 43:25.951
Can I turn around now, please?
No, actually.

43:25.994 --> 43:27.735
[under breath]: Oh, God.

43:27.779 --> 43:29.781
Do you know 
how offensive this is?

43:29.824 --> 43:33.480
"Colin, I'm-I'm very worried
about your delicate sensibility.

43:33.523 --> 43:36.483
Maybe it would be better
if you sit this one out."

43:36.526 --> 43:38.659
An AUSA in my first year,
she had a miscarriage.

43:38.703 --> 43:40.574
She was in the middle of the
biggest trial of her career.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.011
Oh, no. And the same thing
could happen to me? Really?

43:43.055 --> 43:46.667
Could I please just be
a little concerned?

43:46.711 --> 43:48.756
No. You can't.

43:48.800 --> 43:52.586
Some little part of your DNA
is inside me.

43:52.630 --> 43:53.848
That's all.

43:53.892 --> 43:55.720
We had sex.
We both regretted it.

43:55.763 --> 43:57.112
I didn't.

43:57.156 --> 43:59.549
Okay. That's your problem.

43:59.593 --> 44:01.073
Good-bye.

44:01.116 --> 44:04.772
[mutters, chuckles]

44:04.816 --> 44:07.949
You know, I came here
for a different reason.

44:07.993 --> 44:10.212
Colin, I am okay. Really.

44:10.256 --> 44:12.171
You guys represent
Peeper Newsnow, right?

44:12.214 --> 44:13.563
Why?

44:13.607 --> 44:15.000
Oh, just because
we arrested someone,

44:15.043 --> 44:17.176
someone that might prove useful to you.

44:17.219 --> 44:19.004
Who?

44:19.047 --> 44:20.701
No, y-you're not interested, right?

44:20.745 --> 44:22.660
No. No, I-I-I'm interested now.
No, I'll go.

44:22.703 --> 44:25.358
Who?

44:25.401 --> 44:29.579
Lacey Harmon. 
Antifa activist and day trader.

44:29.623 --> 44:31.103
Do you know the plaintiff,

44:31.146 --> 44:32.321
Dennis Honeycutt?

44:32.365 --> 44:33.801
LACEY: No, but I know of him.

44:33.845 --> 44:35.237
I burned his house down.

44:35.281 --> 44:37.196
[gallery murmuring]

44:37.239 --> 44:41.069
Okay, let's keep our voices down.

44:41.113 --> 44:43.202
ADRIAN: How'd you find
his house, Lacey?

44:43.245 --> 44:44.420
LACEY: Online.

44:44.464 --> 44:46.205
There's a picture of it with a street sign

44:46.248 --> 44:47.467
on his Facebook page.

44:47.510 --> 44:50.122
You didn't find it on 
PeeperNews.com?

44:50.165 --> 44:52.080
No. I never even heard of it
till you guys found me.

44:52.124 --> 44:53.386
No further questions, Your Honor.

44:53.429 --> 44:54.387
JUDGE: Okay.

44:54.430 --> 44:56.128
Anything, Ms. Wood Lutz?

44:56.171 --> 44:57.999
Just a recess, Your Honor.

44:58.043 --> 45:01.220
Recess for lunch.

45:01.263 --> 45:02.961
[grunts]

45:03.004 --> 45:05.485
$300,000.

45:05.528 --> 45:07.226
No.

45:07.269 --> 45:09.576
In fact, if you keep pursuing this, 
we will countersue.

45:11.970 --> 45:13.623
Well-played.

45:13.667 --> 45:16.670
[phone ringing]

45:16.714 --> 45:19.586
Diane Lockhart's office.

45:19.629 --> 45:22.589
Um, she's not in right now, Mr. Boseman.

45:22.632 --> 45:24.809
I actually called to talk to you, Marissa.

45:24.852 --> 45:26.114
Me? Why?

45:26.158 --> 45:27.681
Say thank you.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.640
Good job getting that dirt on Mendelssohn.

45:30.684 --> 45:33.774
Oh, well, uh, that was just,
you know...

45:33.818 --> 45:36.777
Marissa, take the thank you.

45:36.821 --> 45:38.213
Right.

45:38.257 --> 45:39.519
You're welcome.

45:39.562 --> 45:41.390
You got your ten percent raise.

45:41.434 --> 45:44.306
You... Seriously?

45:44.350 --> 45:45.873
Really good job.

45:45.917 --> 45:48.615
Uh, thank you, Mr. Boseman.

45:48.658 --> 45:50.182
This is the first raise
I've ever gotten.

45:50.225 --> 45:51.661
First of many, I'm sure.

45:51.705 --> 45:52.750
Bye-bye.

45:54.664 --> 45:56.275
[sighs]

45:56.318 --> 45:59.452
So, what happened to J.D.?

45:59.495 --> 46:01.323
You did.

46:01.367 --> 46:02.498
[knock at door]

46:02.542 --> 46:05.023
Yup. Don't get up.

46:07.025 --> 46:09.897
Adrian, how are you?

46:09.941 --> 46:11.812
Good. Good.

46:11.856 --> 46:13.422
Good. Great.

46:13.466 --> 46:14.946
Listen, everyone at the network loves you.

46:14.989 --> 46:16.382
You're smart.
You're articulate.

46:16.425 --> 46:17.687
The thing is, is we like it

46:17.731 --> 46:19.080
when you bring
a little more heat to the panel.

46:19.124 --> 46:21.430
Oh. Be the angry, black man.

46:21.474 --> 46:22.649
God, no.

46:22.692 --> 46:24.042
That's an ugly stereotype.

46:24.085 --> 46:26.174
Just-just go with your impulses.

46:26.218 --> 46:27.741
People are riled up these days.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.134
They want to hear someone
saying what they're thinking.

46:29.177 --> 46:30.657
That's all.

46:30.700 --> 46:32.746
We're all looking for those viral moments.

46:32.790 --> 46:36.402
I'll see you out there.
That's a great vest.

46:38.404 --> 46:41.102
CHUCK: Why does racism
only go one way?

46:41.146 --> 46:42.843
That's what I want to know.

46:42.887 --> 46:46.281
I see racism against whites
every day, every single day,

46:46.325 --> 46:48.849
yet I'm a racist for pointing that out?

46:48.893 --> 46:50.677
CARDIGAN: Adrian, what's your take?

46:50.720 --> 46:52.374
Take on what?

46:52.418 --> 46:53.811
What Chuck just said.

46:53.854 --> 46:55.421
Is racism just a one-way street?

46:55.464 --> 46:58.119
I think that's his opinion.

46:58.163 --> 46:59.555
Look at your firm, Adrian.

46:59.599 --> 47:01.296
You get the benefit of no-bid contracts

47:01.340 --> 47:03.298
because you're an African-American firm.

47:03.342 --> 47:05.866
Now, a-as a white lawyer, what
am I supposed to think of that?

47:05.910 --> 47:09.304
I don't know.

47:09.348 --> 47:11.437
I think Chuck is pointing out
a double standard here, Adrian.

47:11.480 --> 47:13.047
I mean, take hip-hop.

47:13.091 --> 47:15.441
We've talked about this
on the show before.

47:15.484 --> 47:18.052
You have African-American
rappers saying N-word this

47:18.096 --> 47:20.881
and N-word that,
but a Caucasian can't?

47:20.925 --> 47:22.622
So say it.

47:22.665 --> 47:24.885
Say what?
Say the word you want to say.

47:24.929 --> 47:26.582
I-I'm not saying that
I want to say it.

47:26.626 --> 47:28.106
I'm just saying that I can't.
Sure you can.

47:28.149 --> 47:29.890
Say it. 
Say it right now.

47:29.934 --> 47:32.023
I will say it with you.

47:32.066 --> 47:33.981
Okay, this is hypocritical.

47:34.025 --> 47:35.809
You know we can't.
Sure you can.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.768
This is America. Both of you.
[news theme music playing]

47:38.812 --> 47:40.379
[laughs]: Say it.

47:40.422 --> 47:42.250
N... N...

47:42.294 --> 47:43.861
All right, I think we can move on.

47:43.904 --> 47:45.514
Why? Why move on
when you want to say it?

47:45.558 --> 47:48.126
Both of you want to say it.
Huh?

47:48.169 --> 47:49.431
N...

47:49.475 --> 47:50.955
All together, everybody.

47:50.998 --> 47:53.261
N... N...

[sighs]

48:19.505 --> 48:21.507
Fuck you.

48:23.596 --> 48:25.990
Was I angry enough for you?

48:30.908 --> 48:32.866
I don't think he likes me.

48:32.910 --> 48:34.912
Good job.
