01:19.155 --> 01:22.410
When you're a kid, you don't
think about consequences.

01:23.322 --> 01:24.841
You're invincible.

01:25.797 --> 01:28.618
Of course, they tell you all
kinds of things to scare you.

01:28.965 --> 01:32.176
"Nothing comes easy." "There
is no pleasure without pain."

01:34.434 --> 01:36.257
But, there's something about the Summer,

01:36.387 --> 01:38.731
the promise that anything can happen.

01:39.815 --> 01:43.026
And in my case... it did.

03:23.131 --> 03:25.344
- You got enough books there, Dougie?
 - What?

03:26.716 --> 03:29.103
I said, "You think you got enough books there?"

03:29.667 --> 03:31.968
You gotta get some sun, meet some girls.

03:32.185 --> 03:35.285
Good, thanks. You guys gonna
be my directors all Summer?

03:35.296 --> 03:36.702
- Yes!
 - Something like that.

03:36.744 --> 03:37.739
Thanks, mom.

03:37.783 --> 03:41.292
Yeah. You gotta live a little, Dougie! You got
the rest of your life to be responsible.

03:41.516 --> 03:42.805
Ahoy, Martin!

03:42.849 --> 03:45.924
Speaking of social directors. Looks
like Carson beat us to the lake.

03:45.974 --> 03:49.166
I need your son, Douglas, for...
for urgent work matters!

03:56.403 --> 03:59.742
Don't worry. I've already done
some preliminary scouting, and

03:59.761 --> 04:03.197
I've gotta say, the talent down
here, this Summer, it's ridiculous.

04:03.216 --> 04:05.431
- Ridiculous.
 - Yeah, it looks that way.

04:05.474 --> 04:07.472
- You just gotta dive in.
- Nah, I don't know...

04:07.645 --> 04:09.389
Hey. Look, man...

04:09.424 --> 04:12.376
OK. Say you get turned down nine out of ten times,

04:12.411 --> 04:14.720
do the math, you'll still getting
laid every week and a half.

04:14.806 --> 04:19.630
So, to get to the tenth, we just gotta
hurry up and get through our nine "no"s.

04:19.683 --> 04:22.635
- Hey!
- Well, alright, never mind.

04:23.633 --> 04:24.661
There's one.

04:24.749 --> 04:26.831
Except, odds don't work that way, Carson.

04:27.422 --> 04:30.027
- Hey, don't geek out on me.
- Oh, I geek out?

04:30.342 --> 04:31.429
Yeah!

04:31.472 --> 04:37.160
Like the one time you explained to Tina Mengacchi
about series circuit resistance in physics?

04:37.219 --> 04:38.825
- OK. Who doesn't know that?
- Mmm.

04:39.503 --> 04:42.368
- Girls worth having sex with don't.
- That's true.

04:45.448 --> 04:46.448
Hey!

04:49.789 --> 04:52.003
Who wants to hear some real music?

04:58.685 --> 05:00.117
Come on, Jack!

05:00.872 --> 05:03.723
Hey, y'all ought to be givin' me some applause.

05:03.767 --> 05:06.342
I could be down there arrestin' underage drinkers.

05:07.787 --> 05:11.259
- That's more like it.
- Boo! New Sheriff!

05:11.493 --> 05:16.397
Hey, Gordon. So nice of you to offer to buy
a round for all of my diehard fans, here.

05:17.349 --> 05:18.565
I didn't.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.298
You want them two parking tickets to go away?

05:25.178 --> 05:27.870
You, uh... throw in a third...

05:28.565 --> 05:30.040
you got yourself a deal.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.901
Alright, folks. Look! Drinks on me. Let's go!

05:34.943 --> 05:35.985
Make that a whiskey, Gordon.

05:50.421 --> 05:52.461
Summer has officially commenced.

06:04.180 --> 06:05.311
Hey, I'm home.

06:42.938 --> 06:45.804
<i>Sure ain't much, but this property's available.</i>

06:46.846 --> 06:50.622
First year it's, uh... been on the market.
Gardener's included.

06:51.273 --> 06:55.482
- There you go.
- Think you'll see it's real cozy inside.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.479
Well, let's go.

07:03.425 --> 07:05.335
<i>I'm sure you'll be satisfied.</i>

07:07.635 --> 07:10.065
<i>All current, the latest state of the art.</i>

07:14.711 --> 07:17.400
Watch your step.

07:18.659 --> 07:21.306
A real entertainer's delight.

07:22.045 --> 07:24.822
Radiant light, open kitchen.

07:26.690 --> 07:28.599
And the view is to die for.

07:29.162 --> 07:31.420
You're humpin' the wrong leg, Richard.

07:33.850 --> 07:36.107
I stopped listening three houses ago.

07:40.621 --> 07:43.658
You've got lake access, private pier.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.350
You'd be hard pressed to
find anything more peaceful.

07:55.377 --> 07:59.067
- Hey Dougie, starting the floor.
- I'm coming!

08:03.972 --> 08:05.362
We'll take it.

08:16.776 --> 08:18.425
I knew you'd love it.

08:19.423 --> 08:21.724
I guess that's why you show it last.

08:24.283 --> 08:26.756
- Shall we, uh... take care of a little paperwork?
- Absolutely.

08:26.791 --> 08:27.791
OK.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.216
- Signature there.
 - Mm-hm.

08:39.346 --> 08:41.167
And initial right there.

08:41.732 --> 08:43.077
- Yep.
- That'll do it.

08:43.121 --> 08:44.379
Thanks, Elliot.

08:49.719 --> 08:53.667
It's just like your stupid
molecualr math books, man.

08:53.710 --> 08:56.738
There's a-a formula. You gotta
engage and then you ignore.

08:56.773 --> 08:58.225
- They come right to you.
- Awesome.

08:58.268 --> 08:59.352
Watch out.

08:59.526 --> 09:01.870
Yeah, I've tried. That doesn't work for me, buddy.

09:01.956 --> 09:05.039
Well, you got the ignoring part
down, you just never engage.

09:05.386 --> 09:09.377
You know how many chicks we're gonna meet
this Summer, workin' at the Rudder?

09:09.395 --> 09:10.504
Mucho.

09:11.505 --> 09:12.947
- Right here?
- Mm-hm.

09:15.325 --> 09:17.147
This thing's gonna be worn out.

09:17.973 --> 09:21.013
Yeah. "Come with me a half a mile up the
lake where no one can hear you scream?"

09:21.575 --> 09:25.352
Screams of pleasure, my friend.
Screams of pleasure.

09:25.396 --> 09:27.606
I'm gonna... store some reserve beers in here...

09:27.649 --> 09:29.471
in case you need 'em.

09:29.682 --> 09:31.809
- <i>Put me down!</i>
- Females!

09:35.680 --> 09:36.983
Alright!

09:38.979 --> 09:42.324
I'm gonna make sure that you have
a really great Summer, Doug. OK?

09:43.858 --> 09:45.115
Suck it back.

09:56.905 --> 09:59.857
Oh, hey, Dougie! Dougie, over here!

10:00.723 --> 10:01.723
- Hey.
- Hey!

10:01.742 --> 10:05.212
- What's goin' on?
- Not much. C'mon in.

10:05.845 --> 10:08.970
This's Mr. Harper. He's our new neighbor.
He's from Raleigh.

10:09.005 --> 10:11.300
- By way of New York.
- Oh, really?

10:11.318 --> 10:13.302
Dougie's looking at New York, for college.

10:13.345 --> 10:14.994
Columbia is actually on his short list.

10:15.438 --> 10:16.515
Yup.

10:16.602 --> 10:18.377
Wow, I didn't have the grades for Columbia.

10:18.412 --> 10:19.896
Well, where did you go?

10:20.907 --> 10:22.600
- To work.
- Oh.

10:22.860 --> 10:25.168
Well, it looks like that panned out OK for you.

10:25.203 --> 10:28.763
- Yeah. Hey, I'm Elliot. Uh, Dougie, is it?
- Uh... Doug's better.

10:29.284 --> 10:31.627
Your dad says you know a thing
or two about sailboats?

10:31.670 --> 10:34.439
- Yeah.
- Just picked up a vintage Pearson 33.

10:34.795 --> 10:36.823
Yeah! It's, uh... old Russ Springer's boat, huh?

10:36.865 --> 10:37.876
Yeah.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.655
Yeah, well, your man, Russ,
let it get pretty ragged.

10:40.742 --> 10:44.518
I'm havin' the mast lined out at the boatyard,
right now. It's a hell of a project.

10:44.562 --> 10:46.210
Um, not that I mind...

10:46.254 --> 10:49.465
I always like findin' the diamond
in the rough, shine it up.

10:50.464 --> 10:54.109
- Needs a lot of work.
- It's a 1983.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.703
Yeah, the uh, the... rudder shaft and the bearings
are usually the first thing to go on those.

10:58.138 --> 11:01.401
He and his grandpa could take apart
an engine block blindfolded.

11:01.834 --> 11:04.060
Somehow, that talent skipped a generation.

11:04.095 --> 11:07.987
Well, how about you come over tomorrow and
take a look at it. Maybe I'll hire you.

11:08.390 --> 11:10.778
- Great.
- Better than mowin' lawns.

11:10.813 --> 11:12.079
Yeah, that would be good.

12:21.261 --> 12:24.864
Not bad, huh, Doug? Did you check her out?

12:26.428 --> 12:29.813
- Uh... I...
- The boat. what do you think?

12:30.550 --> 12:33.762
Oh, the, um... the rudder looks good, actually.

12:34.413 --> 12:39.517
The bearings are kinda rusty. I haven't checked out
the engine yet, but, it's mostly just cosmetic.

12:39.664 --> 12:41.705
- Might need a new top coat?
- Alright.

12:44.570 --> 12:48.304
Well, what do you say we tagteam? You make her
look good, and I'll fiddle with the rudder.

12:49.430 --> 12:51.706
I'll have her delivered to the boatyard.
Get you set up

12:51.725 --> 12:53.718
for tomorrow morning, before
I have to catch a plane.

12:53.743 --> 12:55.697
We'll see how much you get done over the weekend.

12:55.770 --> 12:58.331
If you need me I'll be at the San Francisco Ritz.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.798
- Try not need me.
- Good.

13:03.058 --> 13:06.011
So, how's, uh, ten bucks an hour sound?

13:07.094 --> 13:09.092
Fourteen sounds better.

13:12.043 --> 13:15.992
Or twelve... twelve could work, too...
eith-either way.

13:20.074 --> 13:21.809
I would have paid you twenty.

13:58.051 --> 13:59.657
<i>Get off me! Don't touch me!</i>

14:06.468 --> 14:09.117
<i>Get off me! No, get off me!</i>

14:14.499 --> 14:15.845
Well, OK.

14:16.929 --> 14:17.929
See your later.

14:20.836 --> 14:22.008
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:22.354 --> 14:24.352
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Really?

14:24.958 --> 14:27.781
I'm sorry, sir. You don't have the
appropriate sticker for this lot.

14:28.996 --> 14:30.794
I just rented a slip here.

14:30.866 --> 14:33.384
Well, there should be no problem
for me to confirm your ID.

14:38.892 --> 14:40.454
Just doin' my job here.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.531
Sorry, that guy's a bit of a joke around here.

14:46.566 --> 14:48.614
He takes his job a little too seriously.

14:48.699 --> 14:51.043
Hey, I'll tell you what, I prefer that over lazy.

14:52.693 --> 14:54.412
- Sign that for me.
 - Mm-hm.

14:58.076 --> 15:00.550
As the Captain of the Lake Lure
Emergency Security Detail...

15:00.593 --> 15:02.593
I'd like to welcome you to the waterfront, sir.

15:03.849 --> 15:05.151
Thank you, Captain.

15:09.837 --> 15:11.270
Take the slack out.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.088
Alright.

15:21.079 --> 15:23.510
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

15:25.809 --> 15:28.415
- How'd you get all this?
- What?

15:28.849 --> 15:32.885
- I don't know, the house, the Jag...
- The wife?

15:34.535 --> 15:38.049
Money and good looks. Come on!

15:38.675 --> 15:41.235
Yeah. You know, it's simple.
It all comes down to risk.

15:42.147 --> 15:44.645
When other investors don't have the stones to buy,

15:44.819 --> 15:47.741
say, a... I don't know, a high risk property, or

15:47.771 --> 15:52.155
or a company... I do.

15:52.489 --> 15:53.531
Yeah.

15:53.562 --> 15:57.755
In fact, when you feel your
pulse, really start to race...

15:59.709 --> 16:01.747
that's when you gotta step up.

16:02.675 --> 16:03.846
Know what I mean?

16:39.482 --> 16:42.866
- Are you alright?
- It's there. Just there.

16:48.232 --> 16:50.359
Can you please just take care of it?

16:57.433 --> 16:58.734
There we go.

16:59.604 --> 17:04.550
- What? You're just gonna let go?
- Well, I wasn't planning on prosecuting.

17:09.963 --> 17:13.348
Dead. I'm gonna... fix this.

17:16.661 --> 17:22.214
Yeah, I think I jammed it. Elliot's gonna kill me.

17:25.773 --> 17:27.374
Come on. Come on.

17:27.409 --> 17:30.056
Y'know, sometimes you just have to... push in.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.543
Hmm! You got a lot of experience with that?

17:35.878 --> 17:37.971
- Umm.
- You're a lifesaver.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.404
Good thing you're next door.

17:41.052 --> 17:43.656
I, uh... glad to be there.

17:45.349 --> 17:47.564
<i>Alright! A friggin' spider?</i>

17:47.944 --> 17:50.446
Yeah, by the end she was
practically sitting in my lap.

17:51.252 --> 17:52.945
- Exactly.
- She was in here the other night.

17:52.989 --> 17:53.989
Man!

17:54.116 --> 17:57.719
But that husband of hers... he seems
a little loose around the pegs.

17:58.154 --> 17:59.374
Why, what'd he do?

17:59.409 --> 18:01.712
He gave Danny a death glare,
just for talking to her.

18:01.841 --> 18:03.056
Freaked him out.

18:03.099 --> 18:04.446
What? Danny's huge!

18:04.489 --> 18:08.135
Yeah, man. But this guy looks
like he would hit a child.

18:08.179 --> 18:12.563
I'm just sayin'. Hey, hey... watch your shit.

18:12.607 --> 18:15.124
'Cause if he finds out that his lonely,

18:15.167 --> 18:18.465
sex-starved wife, is givin' you a lap dance...

18:18.883 --> 18:20.275
Uh-uhh.

18:20.376 --> 18:24.498
Oh. You got such a pretty smile. It's not gonna
look like that when he's done with you.

18:34.741 --> 18:35.741
Hey.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.770
- Hey.
- I didn't want to wake your parents.

18:44.116 --> 18:47.675
It occured to me, I don't think we
met all the way. You're Doug, right?

18:48.153 --> 18:49.672
- Yeah.
- I'm Lena.

18:50.192 --> 18:52.015
You'll never guess what happened.

18:52.754 --> 18:55.401
The spider came back with a big spider gang?

18:55.488 --> 18:56.922
No!

18:58.179 --> 19:00.654
I... locked myself out.

19:03.128 --> 19:04.343
Give me a hand?

19:05.515 --> 19:06.555
Yeah.

19:10.508 --> 19:14.454
- Would you mind keeping this between us?
- Uh, sure. Why?

19:14.498 --> 19:17.870
Elliot warned me I wouldn't be able to take
care of myself out here in the Summer.

19:17.930 --> 19:20.708
- I hate when he thinks he's right.
- Yeah, well, is he right?

19:21.138 --> 19:23.136
Not if I have you to look after me.

19:25.391 --> 19:27.953
It'll be our secret. This way.

19:28.952 --> 19:30.456
There's a window we can break.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.733
Yeah, but there's gotta be an
open one around here, somewhere.

19:32.752 --> 19:33.814
I checked.

19:36.721 --> 19:37.893
Have at it.

19:38.109 --> 19:40.973
What, we just break your window?
Gonna wake my parents.

19:41.364 --> 19:45.878
I don't know, maybe you could, uh.. wrap
your shirt around it. Muffle the sound.

19:48.049 --> 19:49.916
- OK, can you hold that?
- Yeah.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.762
- You sure?
- Yeah.

20:04.498 --> 20:05.498
Quick!

20:16.495 --> 20:17.495
Hey.

20:17.519 --> 20:20.906
Oh, no, you're bleeding. Now I feel horrible.

20:20.948 --> 20:24.168
- Oh, no, it's no big deal, it's...
- But I'm not sending you home like this.

20:24.203 --> 20:28.240
There's a first-aid kit in the kitchen.
Indulge me. Come on.

20:30.974 --> 20:33.230
- You want a beer?
- Uh, sure. Yeah.

20:37.613 --> 20:38.613
Thanks.

20:39.610 --> 20:43.822
It's research. He's looking
to invest in a micro-brewery.

20:44.733 --> 20:48.290
Me, I don't wanna think about
how profitable a beer is.

20:48.377 --> 20:49.853
I just wanna taste it.

20:50.547 --> 20:52.457
So, it's here, somewhere.

20:52.545 --> 20:55.322
He bought it with all this new stuff, for the boat.

20:56.753 --> 21:01.484
- Projects of the week.
- He doesn't stay interested long?

21:01.572 --> 21:06.087
Well, we've been out here 12 days,
and he's been gone 10 of them.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.213
Even missed our anniversary.

21:10.948 --> 21:12.466
Let's see what we have here.

21:13.049 --> 21:14.263
Lift your shirt.

21:15.765 --> 21:19.411
- It's not as bad as I thought.
- That's always good to hear.

21:34.688 --> 21:36.166
I think you'll live.

21:40.113 --> 21:41.851
Cool.

21:55.825 --> 21:57.820
I'm sorry, that-that was bad.

22:03.507 --> 22:05.244
Then try again...

22:05.808 --> 22:07.153
but better.

22:28.162 --> 22:29.636
You didn't wanna do that.

22:38.403 --> 22:40.052
And you don't wanna do this.

23:10.131 --> 23:11.737
Oh, my God.

23:44.941 --> 23:47.111
Hi. Hey.

23:50.481 --> 23:53.363
I think... you should probably go.

23:55.313 --> 23:56.833
Did I do something wrong?

24:00.130 --> 24:01.692
Look where you are.

24:03.256 --> 24:05.904
I'd say this is pretty wrong.

24:06.425 --> 24:08.942
But no, you were good.

24:09.854 --> 24:11.242
I was?

24:13.151 --> 24:16.536
Wait, have you ever been with a girl before?

24:17.057 --> 24:18.858
Have you ever been with a girl before?

24:19.357 --> 24:23.585
Maybe once or twice, but seriously,
this was your first time? Just now?

24:24.089 --> 24:27.757
No. The kitchen was my first time,
and then the stairs and then here,

24:27.848 --> 24:30.209
so t-technically, it's my third time.

24:32.465 --> 24:35.357
You're very technical, Doug Martin.

24:42.232 --> 24:45.746
You can't tell anybody about this.
You know that, right?

24:46.788 --> 24:47.961
I know.

25:30.887 --> 25:35.139
So... you must be pumped from last night.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.527
What the hell were you watchin', anyway?

25:38.656 --> 25:42.648
Skinemax? YouPorn? Poopydoggy.com?

25:42.735 --> 25:46.293
- What are you talkin' about?
- You butt-dialed me last night, dude.

25:46.425 --> 25:48.940
And... is that you?

25:50.287 --> 25:51.806
Did you go interactive? Hey ...

25:51.849 --> 25:52.849
Great.

25:53.627 --> 25:56.231
Well, why would you settle for that
when you could have the real thing?

25:56.927 --> 25:59.140
Look, Emma Shalloway and Jane Davis.

25:59.184 --> 26:02.526
Aw, look at that smile! She wants your virginity.

26:02.570 --> 26:06.172
- No, I'm good.
- Good! Good?!

26:07.082 --> 26:09.471
Good? What, are you kiddin' me?

26:09.514 --> 26:12.031
Hey, this is ridiculous.

26:12.597 --> 26:15.764
- This is the sound of desperation.
- Yeah, desperation.

26:27.742 --> 26:30.608
- Please don't go all Viagra commercial on me.
- Oh, Dougie.

26:56.302 --> 26:57.648
Don't forget to tip the help.

27:11.770 --> 27:14.765
My husband sent me to see how
you're coming along with the boat.

27:16.224 --> 27:17.961
Show me what you've done inside.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.291
- Shut that, would you?
- Yeah.

27:34.019 --> 27:37.492
- I thought about you all week.
- Me, not at all.

27:41.702 --> 27:44.132
It must be amazing to know how to sail.

27:46.215 --> 27:51.531
My grandfather taught me. When I was
little, he told me about this kid,

27:51.566 --> 27:56.549
Robin Lee Graham, who sailed all around the
world, all by himself. Left when he was 16.

27:56.584 --> 27:57.936
Didn't come back for like, five years.

27:58.801 --> 28:00.494
When do we set sail?

28:02.708 --> 28:04.228
Come on, what's stopping you?

28:05.834 --> 28:10.347
- Well, we-we're on a lake.
- True.

28:12.950 --> 28:16.596
I've always... dreamed of just disappearing.

28:17.899 --> 28:22.603
Just take off, relax, throw caution to the wind.

28:22.635 --> 28:24.674
That is not my specialty.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.053
Trust me, it's easy.

28:30.052 --> 28:33.784
You just... leave everything behind.

29:31.944 --> 29:33.855
<i>Lena! Come on.</i>

29:38.324 --> 29:41.641
Hey, what'd I tell ya? I got a
good feelin' about tonight.

29:41.676 --> 29:43.705
You know, that's what's
incredible about you, Carson.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.860
You always have a good feeling.
You are undeterrable.

29:48.913 --> 29:49.913
Thank you.

30:02.932 --> 30:03.932
Elliot.

30:44.513 --> 30:46.066
Right now. I can't wait.

30:46.110 --> 30:48.190
Are you crazy? Elliot's right out front!

31:15.242 --> 31:16.371
<i>Lena?</i>

31:28.350 --> 31:29.652
Don't move.

31:58.471 --> 31:59.471
Lena?

32:02.031 --> 32:04.869
Oh, there you are. Hurry and finish up.
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

32:04.904 --> 32:07.207
I'm done, just let's get home.

32:17.742 --> 32:18.742
Hey!

32:18.870 --> 32:22.863
I need a word, immediately. Doug, get down here!

32:31.761 --> 32:33.888
This hasn't been caulked thoroughly.

32:35.972 --> 32:39.745
Just one oversight, like that, one
leak... and the whole thing rots.

32:39.875 --> 32:40.875
OK.

32:40.978 --> 32:44.285
Just don't be lazy, Doug. Anything
worth doing's worth doing all the way.

32:45.389 --> 32:47.342
You're right. I'm sorry.

32:50.033 --> 32:54.764
I gotta go out of town again tonight.
I'm workin' on a deal for a micro-brewery.

32:55.330 --> 32:56.717
You travel a lot.

32:59.757 --> 33:02.490
You know why I'm givin' you a hard time, Dougie?

33:07.178 --> 33:11.734
You're not like these kids down here,
just cruisin' through town, partying.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.990
I like that. You take things seriously.

33:14.294 --> 33:17.116
I think I give you a hard time,
because you remind me of me.

33:18.332 --> 33:23.277
Gettin' ahead... takes, uh... sweat... focus.

33:25.668 --> 33:27.966
Then, when you think you get there, and you,

33:28.010 --> 33:30.267
you think you got somebody to... share it with,

33:30.311 --> 33:33.045
you get some respect, some appreciation...

33:34.825 --> 33:37.603
Well, maybe you have to treat someone
right, for them to appreciate you.

33:44.330 --> 33:46.240
Fix the floor, Dougie.

33:57.047 --> 33:58.088
Who wants Oreos?

34:00.996 --> 34:03.123
- What's all this?
- It's a bed picnic.

34:09.199 --> 34:11.717
It's been so long, since I've been this happy.

34:14.277 --> 34:17.752
- Then, why do you look so sad?
- Oh...

34:19.616 --> 34:20.746
I dunno.

34:22.217 --> 34:27.297
I can't help but feel like... like
I'm stealing away your youth.

34:27.601 --> 34:30.335
Are you kidding me? It's the best youth ever.

34:44.659 --> 34:45.788
What's this?

34:45.831 --> 34:49.210
Yeah, when you're young, you don't realize
the permanence of your decisions.

34:50.303 --> 34:51.606
First love...

34:53.036 --> 34:54.643
feels so big.

34:55.076 --> 34:59.111
- What, there was a matching one?
- Mm-hm, they fit together.

34:59.849 --> 35:04.724
Pretty dumb, I know, because, of course, it winds
up being not half a heart but a broken heart.

35:19.295 --> 35:20.467
There we go.

35:21.073 --> 35:23.115
Maybe I'll get a second chance.

35:24.893 --> 35:25.893
Maybe.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.829
- For you.
- What's this?

35:37.524 --> 35:40.604
They're prepaid... untraceable.

35:41.126 --> 35:45.161
Elliot's pretty paranoid. Just keep it hidden.

35:46.030 --> 35:48.156
You have no idea what he's capable of.

35:56.058 --> 35:57.100
You're it!

35:58.270 --> 36:00.658
- Where you going?
- I need more fuel.

36:01.178 --> 36:02.567
Come and get it.

36:05.692 --> 36:08.079
Ah, food. Yes!

36:08.297 --> 36:11.545
God! I'm gonna have to restock
before Elliot gets home.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.225
The gardener.

36:50.484 --> 36:52.741
Hey, you didn't sign the log last time.

36:54.042 --> 36:55.128
Yeah.

36:58.339 --> 36:59.339
Thanks.

37:02.336 --> 37:04.549
I'll leave you two boys to your joyride.

37:05.761 --> 37:08.322
Why don't you join us? Sure Doug wouldn't mind.

37:09.450 --> 37:12.314
Careful. Let's see if you got her seaworthy.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.905
- Everything seems OK, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

37:25.032 --> 37:26.421
Oh, hell.

37:30.067 --> 37:32.714
- How'd that get loose?
- I mean, you must've untied the line, huh?

37:33.236 --> 37:35.188
No, I did not.

37:37.836 --> 37:38.964
Sorry.

37:44.782 --> 37:48.950
So, old Doug, over here, was givin'
me advice on women the other day.

37:49.294 --> 37:51.073
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

37:51.117 --> 37:54.156
- Do you even have a girlfriend, Doug?
- Yeah.

37:54.199 --> 37:57.844
- I guess.
- Hey, if you have to guess, you don't.

37:58.668 --> 38:00.709
She has a boyfriend, back in the city.

38:01.619 --> 38:04.964
She says he's a real prick, though. She hasn't
had a chance to break it off with him, yet.

38:05.095 --> 38:08.349
A boyfriend back in... yeah, right.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.718
- How do you know she's not leadin' you on?
- Elliot.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.932
What? He's a grown man.

38:23.711 --> 38:27.488
Capable of getting grown man advice.
Isn't that right, Dougie?

38:28.876 --> 38:31.742
- Guess so.
- There you go guessin' again!

38:33.192 --> 38:35.839
So, is this one special, this girl?

38:36.776 --> 38:37.905
I'm in love with her.

38:38.904 --> 38:42.203
Careful! Love will cost you more than you think.

38:45.934 --> 38:49.151
- The engine's dumpin' exhaust!
- What the hell! You said it was pristine!

38:49.238 --> 38:51.854
Yeah, well, you don't know 'til
you get it out in the open water.

38:51.884 --> 38:54.012
This is your work we're choking on.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.699
Might wanna be careful with that.

38:58.868 --> 39:01.732
- What'd you just say to me?
- I meant the cigarette.

39:02.558 --> 39:03.946
With the fuel and everything.

39:21.482 --> 39:22.482
You OK?

39:24.086 --> 39:25.144
Oh, come on.

39:25.188 --> 39:26.404
I hate him.

39:27.426 --> 39:31.946
He sleeps around on business trips, then comes
back here, shoves me around, acts like he owns me.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.412
He's taking me back to Raleigh, tonight.

39:39.189 --> 39:41.187
I'm gonna ask him for a divorce.

39:42.965 --> 39:44.614
- OK.
- Ow!

39:45.830 --> 39:46.830
Doug!

39:48.000 --> 39:50.214
Just... fix it.

40:11.775 --> 40:12.775
Hello?

40:12.799 --> 40:18.486
<i>He... he hit me again. I just wanna divorce him.</i>

40:21.680 --> 40:22.854
Where are you?

40:22.897 --> 40:25.152
I'm in Raleigh, outside the Medical Center.

40:29.146 --> 40:30.405
Sorry.

40:31.489 --> 40:35.525
He took a redeye. He'll be out for two weeks.

40:39.388 --> 40:41.994
I don't know what to do anymore.

40:42.556 --> 40:44.119
What do the cops say?

40:46.160 --> 40:50.326
I lied to them. I told them I ran off the road.

40:51.932 --> 40:54.492
- Doug.
- Lena, Lena you gotta tell 'em the truth.

41:00.864 --> 41:03.259
If you won't protect yourself, then I will.

41:04.406 --> 41:06.880
You don't understand what he'd do.

41:09.728 --> 41:10.813
Please.

41:12.376 --> 41:13.376
Come on.

41:30.952 --> 41:33.556
Oh, yeah, kitchen, keep goin' right around front.

41:57.331 --> 41:58.903
Alright, that's not fair.

42:01.464 --> 42:02.809
How you feelin'?

42:02.984 --> 42:04.554
Well, time's a healer.

42:04.589 --> 42:07.029
It's amazing what a difference a week makes, right?

42:08.235 --> 42:10.144
There's a lot going on over there.

42:10.448 --> 42:13.702
Yeah, my dad's on the, uh... romance warpath.

42:14.007 --> 42:16.219
Remodeling the master suite for my mom.

42:17.044 --> 42:20.591
What's goin' on with the gardener? Has
he said anything? He's right there.

42:20.633 --> 42:21.662
No.

42:21.748 --> 42:24.424
Well, he's definitely checkin' you out.

42:25.252 --> 42:27.114
What are you gonna do about it?

42:35.005 --> 42:37.313
Well, it's not exactly the Ritz, but...

42:40.655 --> 42:44.041
No, but I feel like I can breathe out here.

42:50.033 --> 42:54.431
Yeah, when the Summer started, Carson and
I, uh, brought this mattress out here to, uh...

42:55.196 --> 42:57.280
To... what?

42:57.496 --> 42:59.320
Well, we were chasin' after girls.

42:59.623 --> 43:02.745
But, now I've got the most beautiful
woman in the world here with me.

43:14.178 --> 43:17.286
You know, Elliot's first wife's
still fighting him in court.

43:20.371 --> 43:21.933
None of this is gonna be easy.

43:23.222 --> 43:26.836
We could, uh... talk to my mom. I mean,
she's a lawyer, you could get a referral.

43:31.209 --> 43:35.994
No, but thank you. You're sweet.

43:43.781 --> 43:45.948
He's gonna figure it out, soon.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.011
I know.

43:55.759 --> 43:59.866
Somebody's been usin' the
boathouse and it ain't me.

44:00.386 --> 44:04.108
You know... with your new swagger, V-neck shirts,

44:04.127 --> 44:07.795
blowin' off Emma, I'm startin' to
think that that butt-dial was real.

44:07.812 --> 44:09.462
If that girl was real, I mean...

44:09.936 --> 44:12.712
If she was, don't you think
I'd be braggin' about it?

44:14.032 --> 44:15.881
Depends how ugly she is.

44:19.083 --> 44:20.890
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

44:20.975 --> 44:21.975
Hey-hey!

44:22.695 --> 44:23.998
That was pretty quick!

44:24.995 --> 44:27.123
- You think?
- It was like a three hour tour.

44:27.166 --> 44:28.816
<i>- It was not.
- Mm-hm. Yeah.</i>

44:30.898 --> 44:33.850
<i>- Oh, Janice says hi.
- Is she doin' OK?</i>

44:33.979 --> 44:35.065
<i>Yeah.</i>

44:36.628 --> 44:37.842
<i>A spot of wine?</i>

44:37.877 --> 44:40.100
<i>For you, I'm fine.</i>

44:43.920 --> 44:45.394
- Lena?
- Doug.

44:47.607 --> 44:49.735
You crazy? My parents are right downstairs.

44:49.865 --> 44:50.993
How'd you even get in?

44:51.461 --> 44:52.980
Construction entrance.

44:54.119 --> 44:56.680
Promise me you'll stay with me, no matter what.

44:57.201 --> 44:58.415
What did he do to you?

44:59.848 --> 45:00.848
<i>Doug?</i>

45:03.147 --> 45:06.492
Come over as soon as you can.
I need you right now.

45:06.527 --> 45:07.968
OK, I will. OK.

45:16.471 --> 45:18.663
You forgot these, your highness.
You want me to put 'em away?

45:18.698 --> 45:20.855
- No. No, I got it. Thanks, mom.
- OK.

45:39.170 --> 45:40.732
Lena, what's goin' on?

45:42.079 --> 45:43.380
Come here.

45:49.239 --> 45:52.061
He found out, didn't he? He knows.

46:00.092 --> 46:01.437
Oh, God.

46:02.957 --> 46:04.258
He came at me, and I...

46:04.736 --> 46:08.380
I just... hit him with the first thing
I could grab and he fell, and...

46:08.424 --> 46:11.678
- You called an ambulance, right?
- I couldn't.

46:12.547 --> 46:16.672
- They'll think I murdered him.
- No, he attacked you. You were defending yourself.

46:16.760 --> 46:20.044
You don't know what his family's like, you should
see what they dragged his ex-wife through.

46:20.097 --> 46:25.011
They will... they will use every penny they have
to hire an army of lawyers to pin this on me.

46:25.873 --> 46:29.821
They will do anything to keep the world
from knowing their son beat his wife.

46:29.865 --> 46:33.165
We have to tell someone, like the
cops, or-or my parents, or...

46:33.181 --> 46:35.855
Your parents? How?

46:36.463 --> 46:39.054
What, and tell them about us, too?
I mean, Doug, if that came out...

46:39.057 --> 46:40.057
We can explain.

46:40.081 --> 46:42.079
I'm dead if you go to anyone, Doug.

46:44.305 --> 46:45.576
Please.

46:49.240 --> 46:52.321
I need your help. I... I need you.

46:53.566 --> 46:55.532
This is too big a deal, Lena. What are you...?

46:59.508 --> 47:00.680
OK.

47:01.505 --> 47:05.629
You're right. I can't drag you into this.

47:06.149 --> 47:07.669
You're just a kid.

47:16.827 --> 47:18.130
Doug.

47:21.514 --> 47:25.028
If you... promise me it'll be OK, I'll call them.

47:26.808 --> 47:29.889
It's too risky to try handling this myself, right?

47:32.580 --> 47:34.100
Doug, what do I do?

47:37.877 --> 47:40.307
Oh, your pulse, it's racing.

47:43.868 --> 47:46.932
We just have to think straight, alright?
We gotta stay calm.

47:49.205 --> 47:51.166
The most important thing,
right now, is to act normal.

47:51.201 --> 47:53.934
That means I go to work, I
go home, I come back later.

47:53.977 --> 47:56.844
Don't talk to anyone. Don't touch him.
Don't do anything.

47:57.234 --> 47:59.362
When I get back, we'll figure this out, OK?

48:22.886 --> 48:24.487
What's wrong with you tonight, man?

48:24.491 --> 48:27.572
She cut you off, or something? The mystery girl?

48:27.659 --> 48:31.479
There's no... mysterious girl, alright?

48:33.433 --> 48:34.474
OK, man.

48:34.518 --> 48:36.253
<i>Sorry boys, duty calls.</i>

48:36.258 --> 48:37.642
I'm just kidding.

48:47.450 --> 48:50.575
Fog rollin' in, not gonna be an easy cleanup.
I'll tell you that.

48:52.052 --> 48:54.439
Hey, Gus. Where they goin'?

48:54.525 --> 48:56.088
Accident on the interstate.

48:56.641 --> 48:59.181
City people comin' in here
bangin' up the guardrails.

49:03.075 --> 49:06.418
- Hey, guys, I'm late.
- Hey, Dougie. Come join us for a sec.

49:08.633 --> 49:10.325
You remember Lena Harper?

49:12.146 --> 49:14.100
Yeah, I think we met at the boatyard.

49:15.229 --> 49:16.270
Yeah, that's right.

49:17.095 --> 49:19.221
My husband says you're doing a great job.

49:19.309 --> 49:21.610
Thank you. It's good to see you again.

49:22.260 --> 49:23.867
It's been a long day, I'm gonna go to bed.

49:25.689 --> 49:27.663
Have a good night. Good night, guys.

49:27.698 --> 49:29.638
- Good night, Doug.
- Good night, honey.

49:33.285 --> 49:34.899
He's a little shy with girls.

49:34.934 --> 49:37.233
<i>Oh, give him time, he'll have no problem.</i>

49:49.040 --> 49:51.210
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

49:51.904 --> 49:56.939
It's just I couldn't stay here in the house with
him. It's like he was.... looking at me, and...

49:57.842 --> 50:00.836
Alright, I've been thinkin' about this all night.
We need to make it look like an accident.

50:00.871 --> 50:03.579
- It was an accident.
- I know but, but...

50:04.316 --> 50:06.447
I dunno. Like he-like he fell
down the stairs, or something.

50:06.490 --> 50:08.790
And cracked his head with a fire extinguisher?

50:09.021 --> 50:11.603
I mean, his skull's caved in, Doug.

50:11.838 --> 50:14.386
There's no way to make that look like an accident.

50:23.893 --> 50:25.280
I know what to do.

50:32.182 --> 50:33.961
After the fight, you went to bed.

50:34.091 --> 50:36.349
You woke up, he was gone. Got it?

50:38.562 --> 50:39.821
Thank you.

51:06.947 --> 51:08.120
Oh, shit.

51:31.381 --> 51:32.988
- Mr. Harper!
- No.

51:34.248 --> 51:35.636
<i>Mr. Harper?</i>

51:37.156 --> 51:38.459
Mr. Harper?

51:39.759 --> 51:40.800
<i>Hey!</i>

52:33.535 --> 52:35.794
Give it here, man.

52:41.999 --> 52:44.212
- Alright, let's check it against dentals.
- Got it.

52:55.107 --> 52:56.192
<i>Hello?</i>

52:57.928 --> 52:58.928
<i>Wait, Janice?</i>

53:00.272 --> 53:03.743
<i>What? Janice, calm down.</i>

53:09.516 --> 53:11.599
I think there's a detector out back.

53:13.516 --> 53:15.852
<i>Yeah, but where did you...?</i>

53:18.111 --> 53:22.648
OK. Yeah, I... Oh, my God. I don't know.

53:24.793 --> 53:29.048
I think they're coming around, now.
Oh, my God, Janice.

53:30.002 --> 53:31.348
The poor woman.

54:37.407 --> 54:40.791
Hey, lighten up, man. You're
right in the middle of it.

54:40.996 --> 54:43.917
- You're like a minor celebrity.
- How'm I in the middle of anything?

54:44.400 --> 54:48.516
Uhh... let's see, you're the next door neighbor.
You got a lap dance from the bereaved.

54:48.603 --> 54:50.209
And you fixed the boat that blew up.

54:50.284 --> 54:52.250
Remind me not to ever have you fix my boat.

54:52.987 --> 54:54.897
Now, there's all this money flyin' around.

54:54.940 --> 54:55.940
Money?

54:57.414 --> 55:02.277
Hey, Gus. We oughta update Doug
on his upcoming media tour.

55:02.312 --> 55:04.316
Can you tell him about the insurance policy?

55:04.881 --> 55:07.312
- Five million bucks.
- Mm-hm. And it gets better...

55:07.398 --> 55:08.482
How's this?

55:08.569 --> 55:11.912
After three years of marriage,
doubles, 10 million dollars.

55:12.477 --> 55:14.097
Math being Lem's strong suit.

55:14.142 --> 55:15.859
- Watch yourself.
- I'll tell you one thing.

55:15.904 --> 55:19.073
- They hate payin' out them big claims.
- Can't blame 'em for that.

55:19.159 --> 55:24.133
Lem and I were on with that insurance gal, this
mornin', and I shoulda kept my damn trap shut.

55:24.193 --> 55:27.971
Because as soon as I said I suspected the
widow, she was in a car, headed our way.

55:28.274 --> 55:31.704
Thinks she's big time, because she's
a certified law enforcement agent.

55:31.851 --> 55:35.351
So, of course, she says, "I
will draw my own conclusions."

55:35.386 --> 55:38.483
You bet your butt she's gonna
come stompin' around tomorrow,

55:38.518 --> 55:40.949
knockin' over rocks and disturbin' the peace.

55:41.556 --> 55:42.857
Our peace.

56:07.727 --> 56:10.852
- Angela Alvarez, we... spoke on the phone.
- Mm-hm.

56:11.997 --> 56:15.711
So, as you can imagine, Allied Trust
is taking this case very seriously.

56:16.017 --> 56:20.185
I know, grocer knows, the dog
walker knows. Heck, yeah.

56:21.574 --> 56:26.594
Ever since I took over, as Sheriff of Lake
Lure, we have never had a major incident.

56:26.623 --> 56:27.692
Until now.

56:27.822 --> 56:31.512
Lemme tell you somethin'. I know how
to get to the bottom of things in

56:31.556 --> 56:35.044
this town, a whole lot quicker than some
rookie insurance agent sniffin' around.

56:35.130 --> 56:37.414
- I-I'm not a rookie.
- Yeah, you're a rookie.

56:37.630 --> 56:39.191
This is your first big case.

56:40.495 --> 56:41.597
How did you know that?

56:41.605 --> 56:44.514
Well, for one thing, you're sweatin'.

56:44.601 --> 56:47.778
You filed the injunction in the wrong jurisdiction.

56:48.152 --> 56:49.715
And, you just told me.

56:52.319 --> 56:55.703
Or, you used to work the East Precinct and...
you made a phone call.

56:57.249 --> 57:00.504
Alright, let's get this damn thing over with, then.

57:01.029 --> 57:04.933
I'd prefer to use your office
for the initial interviews.

57:05.339 --> 57:08.794
Sense of authority. A, neutral ground and all that.

57:08.880 --> 57:11.513
Why don't we put her in a
shorter chair, a little sleep

57:11.532 --> 57:14.399
deprivation, rubber hose? That'll
break her down right away.

57:14.828 --> 57:18.256
I'm the only thing standing between
that woman and 10 million dollars.

57:18.291 --> 57:19.341
So...

57:19.861 --> 57:25.114
you may not have to take your job
seriously, Sheriff... so I will.

57:53.759 --> 57:58.577
Was this something new, for him,
taking the boat out alone, at night?

57:58.578 --> 57:59.991
Mm-hm.

58:00.010 --> 58:01.441
We had a fight.

58:01.842 --> 58:03.420
Umm...

58:03.439 --> 58:07.042
You know, we've had our issues, off
and on, that's not exactly a secret.

58:07.172 --> 58:08.997
- And this time?
- I think we covered this.

58:09.040 --> 58:10.480
Yes, I'd like to hear it again.

58:11.901 --> 58:14.028
I had a drink with my neighbors.

58:15.287 --> 58:17.287
- I came home.
- OK.

58:17.305 --> 58:19.062
He was drunk.

58:19.063 --> 58:24.153
Things escalated. He said he was just
going out for a drive, and then, um...

58:24.445 --> 58:26.256
And then you showed up, in the morning.

58:26.286 --> 58:29.220
Were either of you having relations...
with other people?

58:29.394 --> 58:34.688
No. I mean, issues... yes, but, um...
nothing like that.

58:36.685 --> 58:40.525
At least, I certainly wasn't.
Um, can we maybe take a break?

58:40.660 --> 58:44.166
Yeah, OK, I think my client
has been through enough.

58:44.210 --> 58:46.190
No dalliances, no flirtations?

58:46.234 --> 58:49.010
I mean, you've been married, what, three years?

58:49.271 --> 58:50.789
You don't have to answer this.

58:52.093 --> 58:56.019
I mean, I came out here thinking you could
help me figure out what happened that night.

58:56.146 --> 59:01.860
And instead, I've had to endure 2 hours of pointed
suspicion and a complete lack of compassion.

59:01.902 --> 59:03.768
Sorry, I can't do this. Can we go now?

59:06.416 --> 59:07.502
Big Jack.

59:08.760 --> 59:10.366
Lemuel, talk to me.

59:10.713 --> 59:12.796
Tox boys confirmed he was good and drunk.

59:13.532 --> 59:15.923
Matched, uh... tissues pulled
from the bone to his DNA.

59:15.958 --> 59:19.517
He died of cranial hemorrhagin' before
the cigarette and gasoline did the rest.

59:19.522 --> 59:23.646
Not a pretty way to go, I'm afraid.
But it seems fairly straightforward.

59:28.291 --> 59:30.432
- Can I help you?
- Umm...

59:30.506 --> 59:32.934
I may have had a suspect sighting, that night.

59:40.573 --> 59:43.394
- Want anything, Dougie? No?
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

59:54.592 --> 59:57.284
- Jack! What's the latest?
- Hi.

59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.443
Well, I'll tell you, that insurance lady
is certainly a pain in the kiester.

01:00:00.444 --> 01:00:01.447
Mm-hm.

01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:03.112
She turn up anything?

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:07.473
Well, so far, all we have is that...
what that security guard saw, now

01:00:07.556 --> 01:00:09.914
he claims somebody else was
in the boat that night.

01:00:10.131 --> 01:00:13.867
So I'm takin' him down to get a sketch
made and see what we get from that.

01:00:17.335 --> 01:00:22.935
'Course, for all I know, he's just stringin' us
along so he gets to ride in a big ole police car.

01:00:29.314 --> 01:00:33.828
- Hey, man? Keepin' the peace?
- Doin' my best.

01:00:34.436 --> 01:00:38.603
Well, better those guys keep such good records now,
with all that stuff goin' on at the boatyard, huh?

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.557
Well, that's what I'm there for.

01:00:41.859 --> 01:00:45.096
- Any leads, or...?
 - Yeah.

01:00:45.894 --> 01:00:48.369
I saw Elliot Harper take out the boat that night.

01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:54.184
But then I realized, later...
I think it was someone else.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.374
Were you plannin' on tellin'
me you were comin' here?

01:01:14.367 --> 01:01:17.449
- After you.
- Thank you.

01:02:00.114 --> 01:02:01.114
Rich people.

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.727
Sheriff!

01:02:24.767 --> 01:02:26.416
Found something!

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:04.480
So... I think that I screwed
up, so don't get mad, OK?

01:03:04.524 --> 01:03:06.561
- OK.
- OK.

01:03:07.057 --> 01:03:10.337
That insurance chick? Came
with the-the messy hot one?

01:03:10.356 --> 01:03:11.430
Yeah.

01:03:11.465 --> 01:03:14.373
Well, her and Big Jack were hitting me
with a bunch of questions, last night.

01:03:14.408 --> 01:03:15.684
And I, uh...

01:03:15.719 --> 01:03:18.629
I may have said somethin'
before I could really think.

01:03:18.845 --> 01:03:20.104
Questions about what?

01:03:22.275 --> 01:03:26.832
About you... and how you been
acting all Summer, s-stuff like that.

01:03:27.831 --> 01:03:28.831
Yeah, so?

01:03:30.346 --> 01:03:31.476
And, um...

01:03:32.864 --> 01:03:35.121
I may have said that there's a mysterious woman?

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.895
That's your own fantasy, Carson.
I told you, there's no...

01:03:41.328 --> 01:03:43.367
There's no woman, there's nothing.

01:03:46.146 --> 01:03:48.967
Thanks for believin' me. You're...
you're a real friend.

01:03:51.632 --> 01:03:53.324
I told you not to get mad.

01:04:10.494 --> 01:04:12.362
<i>- Can I come in?
- Sure.</i>

01:04:12.397 --> 01:04:13.447
<i>Yes, please.</i>

01:04:14.575 --> 01:04:17.656
<i>Well, I have just a couple questions.</i>

01:04:18.958 --> 01:04:20.000
<i>OK.</i>

01:04:23.384 --> 01:04:28.071
<i>So, Mrs. Harper left around the same time
that your son went upstairs, that night?</i>

01:04:28.219 --> 01:04:29.547
Ten thirty-ish?

01:04:30.111 --> 01:04:33.064
<i>- You're sure about that time, right?
- Yes, I'm absolutely sure.</i>

01:04:33.974 --> 01:04:36.970
<i>What is she doing? Now that the
house is sealed, where is she?</i>

01:04:37.231 --> 01:04:40.831
<i>Pines Motel. I'm afraid that...
not a whole lot of other options.</i>

01:04:41.788 --> 01:04:45.564
<i>Well, at any rate, I-I'd like Doug to come down
to the station and give an initial statement.</i>

01:04:45.694 --> 01:04:48.399
<i>- Thanks, Em. Thanks, Brian.
- See your later.</i>

01:04:48.442 --> 01:04:49.442
<i>Yep.</i>

01:05:13.608 --> 01:05:16.987
That's the last one. Check it out.

01:05:20.504 --> 01:05:23.063
Don't worry, Dougie... it's just a formality.

01:05:25.059 --> 01:05:26.059
Yeah.

01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:28.012
<i>Hey, I'm Elliot. Dougie, is it?</i>

01:05:28.618 --> 01:05:31.702
<i>Your parents? What?</i>

01:05:34.565 --> 01:05:36.736
<i>Anything worth doing's worth doing all the way.</i>

01:05:37.603 --> 01:05:39.253
I w-I worked on the boat.

01:05:39.387 --> 01:05:41.030
- Uh, Mr. Harper...
- Mm-hm.

01:05:41.048 --> 01:05:42.721
Um... a pretty intense guy.

01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:46.631
Uh, drank... a bit, you know, and, um...

01:05:47.932 --> 01:05:50.189
- he was... fairly nice to me, and...
- So,

01:05:50.233 --> 01:05:53.533
that's how Mr. Harper struck you, uh...
as a drinker?

01:05:53.706 --> 01:05:55.675
Uh, it's not like we really hung out that much.

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:57.845
I mean, he must have made some
sort of impression on you.

01:05:58.827 --> 01:06:01.114
Yeah, I mean, he-he drank some,
when we took the boat out.

01:06:01.188 --> 01:06:03.314
So, he-he drank some or he drank a lot?

01:06:05.602 --> 01:06:07.595
- A... decent amount. Um...
- Uh-huh.

01:06:07.613 --> 01:06:10.313
He liked, uh... bourbon, mostly, and...

01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:12.282
seemed to smoked too much, too.

01:06:12.863 --> 01:06:15.884
So, how would you characterize Mr.
Harper's relationship with his wife?

01:06:17.185 --> 01:06:20.258
I... I barely really met her. You know,

01:06:20.356 --> 01:06:23.133
she-she came on the boat with us
once and to the bar with him, uh...

01:06:23.827 --> 01:06:27.643
y'know, but I only ever really met her-met
her, uh... one night, at her house.

01:06:27.661 --> 01:06:29.761
- I said, what... t-two words to her?
- Mm-hm.

01:06:35.154 --> 01:06:36.154
Doug...

01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:39.060
just so we're straight here...

01:06:39.711 --> 01:06:42.331
it's my job to find out exactly
what happened, so everyone

01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:45.344
gets what they deserve... one way or the other.

01:06:46.137 --> 01:06:49.262
So, if you lie to me... or
intentionally mislead me,

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:52.387
that is conspiracy to defraud, and that...

01:06:53.774 --> 01:06:57.073
- That's a felony.
- Wait-wait, uh, what... what is this shit?

01:06:57.108 --> 01:07:00.338
We came here of our own accord, Ms. Alvarez, and

01:07:00.373 --> 01:07:03.323
while I'm happy to let Doug help
you in your investigation,

01:07:03.669 --> 01:07:07.216
I'm not about to let my son be "bad
copped" by some insurance investigator.

01:07:07.251 --> 01:07:10.661
- I'm an attorney, and I'm...
- Really? What kind?

01:07:10.745 --> 01:07:12.611
Wills and trusts.

01:07:12.699 --> 01:07:17.094
But that doesn't mean that I don't recognize an
interrogation, when I see one. We're done here.

01:07:22.855 --> 01:07:24.070
Thank you, Doug.

01:07:30.972 --> 01:07:32.056
Hey, Doug.

01:07:36.526 --> 01:07:39.002
So, after the sketch artist
reviewed some of the evidence...

01:07:39.046 --> 01:07:42.388
- Like what?
- Aw... can't talk about that.

01:07:42.406 --> 01:07:43.730
I gotta keep that under wraps.

01:07:43.731 --> 01:07:46.683
But I can tell you this. A full-blown
murder investigation is...

01:07:47.723 --> 01:07:50.372
- Murder?
- Widow's tellin' a new story.

01:07:50.852 --> 01:07:54.234
Some stalker harrassing her,
then he killed Elliot Harper.

01:07:54.264 --> 01:07:56.479
<i>Stalker, right? From out of town, probably.</i>

01:07:56.709 --> 01:07:57.709
<i>You would think that.</i>

01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:59.226
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:07:59.369 --> 01:08:03.158
Look man I-I... I'm sorry that I
mentioned the imaginary woman.

01:08:03.567 --> 01:08:04.870
I'm a dumbass.

01:08:05.433 --> 01:08:10.121
But, uh... you already knew that, before
you decided to be friends with me.

01:08:10.467 --> 01:08:13.810
So it's kinda one of the...
pre-conditions for our friendship.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.890
So, we cool?

01:08:23.053 --> 01:08:24.484
I said, are we cool?

01:08:25.224 --> 01:08:27.437
Yeah... yeah, everything's cool.

01:08:28.687 --> 01:08:32.212
Look, I gotta take lunch early. Cover for me?

01:08:35.892 --> 01:08:37.220
You know it.

01:08:40.804 --> 01:08:43.237
Aren't you afraid the insurance
investigator would follow you?

01:08:43.323 --> 01:08:45.450
- I was careful.
- Or your stalker?

01:08:45.752 --> 01:08:49.301
They kept asking the same questions
over and over and I panicked.

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:52.715
If that investigator had anything solid,
she would have done something by now.

01:08:52.758 --> 01:08:55.580
- Lena, they're figuring it out.
- Doug, calm down.

01:08:55.624 --> 01:08:57.300
Come on, they're not gonna find any evidence.

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:59.773
I mean, there isn't anything.

01:09:01.857 --> 01:09:03.505
Except our phones, Lena.

01:09:07.325 --> 01:09:08.627
You're right.

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:11.319
OK.

01:09:11.968 --> 01:09:16.352
OK. Just take them, smash them.
Throw 'em in the lake.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.435
Whatever. I trust you.

01:09:20.519 --> 01:09:24.077
We have to be apart for a while.
Let things calm down.

01:09:27.377 --> 01:09:28.419
You're right.

01:09:30.103 --> 01:09:31.630
Alright, we can figure this out.

01:09:36.318 --> 01:09:38.671
Alright, listen... come grab your
phone later, when it's safe.

01:09:38.714 --> 01:09:39.788
- OK.
- OK?

01:09:39.832 --> 01:09:41.872
Send me a text, let me know where you are.
I'll do the same.

01:09:42.002 --> 01:09:43.435
Are you sure can risk this?

01:09:43.566 --> 01:09:47.645
If we don't do this... we'll
have no way to be in touch.

01:09:47.692 --> 01:09:50.392
I mean, pretty soon, we won't
even be in the same city.

01:09:50.727 --> 01:09:54.548
- OK.
- Alright? So-so after that, then what?

01:09:56.065 --> 01:09:58.018
I... I don't know Doug.

01:09:59.712 --> 01:10:01.361
But I know I love you.

01:10:05.575 --> 01:10:07.528
We can always see each other carefully.

01:10:07.932 --> 01:10:10.823
Next year you're out of your parents' house right?

01:10:10.909 --> 01:10:12.109
Yeah.

01:10:12.315 --> 01:10:14.122
We can actually be together.

01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:17.420
If you still want to, after all this.

01:10:21.369 --> 01:10:22.758
Of course I do.

01:10:33.105 --> 01:10:37.822
Do you realize how hard it was for us to get 3
months, free and clear, to come out here to relax!

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:41.487
And instead, what're we doin'? We're
runnin' around Sheriff stations and

01:10:41.522 --> 01:10:44.373
havin' our son interrogated.
And now in our own home?

01:10:46.674 --> 01:10:48.688
What's up? I-I gotta shower and get back to work.

01:10:48.761 --> 01:10:51.101
I'll give you a ride over to the
Rudder when we're done, Dougie.

01:10:51.319 --> 01:10:52.706
This'll just take a few minutes.

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.441
He doesn't have to do this.
Doug, you don't have to do this.

01:10:57.133 --> 01:10:59.694
Actually... yes, he does.

01:11:06.134 --> 01:11:08.384
<i>It's just that we found some
physical evidence next door.</i>

01:11:08.403 --> 01:11:10.739
We gotta rule out anybody who mighta had access.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.384
Looks like Mrs. Harper was tellin' the
truth about that stalker, after all.

01:11:14.667 --> 01:11:16.751
<i>Wow! So, she's no longer a suspect?</i>

01:11:16.882 --> 01:11:21.455
Supposedly, there's a rape kit she'd done, about
a month ago, up to Raleigh Medical Center.

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:25.126
<i>This guy had a hood on, it was dark,
so she couldn't identify him.</i>

01:11:25.737 --> 01:11:28.513
DNA match from the blood that
we lifted from the window.

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.422
Hold still, please.

01:11:31.638 --> 01:11:35.969
Stalker shattered it when he broke in
that night and stole some undergarments.

01:11:36.013 --> 01:11:39.293
Her underwear?! Oh, my God, and all of
this has been happening right next door?

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:40.170
Just relax.

01:11:40.205 --> 01:11:42.504
<i>We think the stalker's gotta
be linked to the murder.</i>

01:11:45.959 --> 01:11:47.090
Open wide.

01:11:54.468 --> 01:11:58.591
<i>Just gotta gas up and I'll get you on
over to the Rudder, Dougie. Coffee?</i>

01:11:58.635 --> 01:12:00.068
<i>Yeah, I'll take one.</i>

01:12:02.976 --> 01:12:06.057
Cream, no sugar, please.

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:17.079
Where'd you say you went, after you
came home from work, that night?

01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:18.426
To bed.

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:25.372
Did anybody actually, uh... see you...
in your bedroom, after, say... midnight?

01:12:27.106 --> 01:12:29.277
- No.
- So, no one saw you 'til the morning?

01:12:31.492 --> 01:12:35.564
She's gonna walk, with 10 million
dollars, while someone else hangs.

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:39.825
Look, Doug... this is what I do.

01:12:40.475 --> 01:12:41.475
Right?

01:12:41.751 --> 01:12:44.078
I see the scam beneath the story.

01:12:44.122 --> 01:12:46.306
The way all the puzzle pieces slide together.

01:12:46.381 --> 01:12:50.010
It's just the way my brain works. Always has.

01:12:51.084 --> 01:12:52.472
I told you everything.

01:12:59.138 --> 01:13:00.527
So I know you watched her.

01:13:01.438 --> 01:13:05.587
I know you were obsessed with her. I know that
your DNA will match the blood on the window.

01:13:05.621 --> 01:13:06.429
OK.

01:13:06.473 --> 01:13:08.600
Thing is, you don't strike me as the stalker type.

01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:14.893
You strike me as the... sexually
inexperienced, easily manipulated type...

01:13:15.153 --> 01:13:18.496
just might kill his lover's husband,
in pursuit of some fantasy.

01:13:19.624 --> 01:13:22.836
I get why you fell for her. I mean, look at her.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.272
What, she tell you she loved you?
That it'll all work out?

01:13:26.524 --> 01:13:28.565
The two of you were gonna be together someday?

01:13:31.169 --> 01:13:33.210
Whatever you think she is, you're wrong.

01:13:34.033 --> 01:13:36.724
Lem! Lem, let me out.

01:13:36.941 --> 01:13:38.287
- Wait, whoa, just a second.
- Lem, let me out!

01:13:38.971 --> 01:13:40.911
- Let me out!
- Doug... hey, hey!

01:13:47.663 --> 01:13:49.398
I'm gonna have trouble, Carson.

01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:05.543
<i>Ske crushed his skull in,
with a fire extinguisher.</i>

01:14:06.658 --> 01:14:09.147
I don't know why, but I-I helped cover it up.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.835
You helped cover up a murder?

01:14:12.879 --> 01:14:14.876
I didn't know it was a murder.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.740
So, you've been lying to everyone
the entire Summer, and...

01:14:18.322 --> 01:14:21.386
But, now you gotta prove that your lies were lies.

01:14:22.905 --> 01:14:24.772
I just have to own up and confess.

01:14:26.376 --> 01:14:29.375
Yeah, you have to confess. But first,
you need to find something concrete

01:14:29.394 --> 01:14:31.931
that proves that she was with you, by choice.

01:14:32.496 --> 01:14:34.928
Hey... hey, you need evidence.

01:14:36.103 --> 01:14:38.802
It's in our phones, our disposable ones, uh...

01:14:39.137 --> 01:14:43.369
there are-there are texts and... you
know, kinda... personal pictures?

01:14:43.404 --> 01:14:47.602
Well, I don't-I don't need the details.
Well, I do, but... later.

01:14:47.732 --> 01:14:49.208
A-a phone is good, though.

01:14:49.597 --> 01:14:55.110
Is there anything else? Think, Doug.
Did, uh... did-did anyone see you?

01:14:56.543 --> 01:14:59.449
Her gardener... uh, he saw us together.

01:15:00.491 --> 01:15:03.008
You might wanna figure out
how to get Big Jack on that.

01:15:05.049 --> 01:15:06.654
- As in, now.
- Yeah.

01:15:11.516 --> 01:15:14.510
I'm sorry. I've been lying, this
whole time, to you, Carson.

01:15:16.944 --> 01:15:18.333
It was a shitty thing to do.

01:15:20.847 --> 01:15:22.106
Hey, it's OK.

01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:27.403
Plus, I've been, uh... I've been lying to you, too.

01:15:29.038 --> 01:15:30.919
Been bangin' yo momma.

01:15:31.959 --> 01:15:35.605
Kidding. OK, go get Jack.

01:15:42.287 --> 01:15:44.219
- Hi there, Dougie.
- Hey.

01:15:44.261 --> 01:15:45.954
- Come set a spell.
- OK.

01:15:48.928 --> 01:15:52.446
Say, Lem told me that that lady
rode you pretty hard. You OK?

01:15:53.444 --> 01:15:54.702
Never better.

01:15:55.222 --> 01:15:57.913
- How 'bout a little water, boy, hm?
- Yes, please.

01:16:01.082 --> 01:16:02.645
There you go.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:04.860
Thank you.

01:16:05.987 --> 01:16:07.550
Now, Dougie.

01:16:07.982 --> 01:16:11.080
Out here, I can make a fella
shell out for a parking ticket.

01:16:11.123 --> 01:16:13.424
Or I can make him buy beers for everybody in here.

01:16:13.971 --> 01:16:15.968
Either way, he's gon' pay the piper.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.210
But my way is a better way, for everyone.

01:16:19.297 --> 01:16:21.264
See, that's why I love livin' out here.

01:16:21.871 --> 01:16:27.766
This is the Emerald City, and I am the fella
behind the curtains... yankin' them levers.

01:16:28.296 --> 01:16:30.725
Keepin' everybody happy, and safe.

01:16:32.131 --> 01:16:34.806
But the city is creepin' into our backyard.

01:16:35.934 --> 01:16:38.582
Dougie, I've known your family a long time.

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:42.313
So if you have anything you need to say...

01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:46.525
I'd be a good person for you to say it to.

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:50.165
Dougie, I'm runnin' out of levers.

01:16:53.903 --> 01:16:55.204
I...

01:16:56.115 --> 01:16:57.808
Ex-excuse me, one second.

01:17:00.587 --> 01:17:02.504
- Hello?
- <i>Your mom and I need to talk to you.</i>

01:17:02.539 --> 01:17:03.890
Hey, Dad. I-I'm in the middle of talkin'

01:17:03.934 --> 01:17:06.597
- with Jack.
- <i>Doug, do not speak to anyone, for legal reasons.</i>

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.941
- OK, Alright.
- <i>Get home, now.</i>

01:17:09.788 --> 01:17:11.828
Sorry, Big Jack, uh... I gotta go.

01:17:12.654 --> 01:17:14.606
But I thought of somone you should talk to.

01:17:16.095 --> 01:17:17.395
Umm...

01:17:17.414 --> 01:17:21.116
The Harpers had a gardener.
He seemed to be around, a lot.

01:17:21.766 --> 01:17:25.021
A gardener, huh? OK, I'll run him down.

01:17:26.454 --> 01:17:27.670
Thank you.

01:17:44.945 --> 01:17:48.884
Hey, Lem, scan these prints. Give 'em
all to Gonzales in the East Precinct.

01:17:48.928 --> 01:17:50.455
- Right.
- Make sure he knows.

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:53.528
I need them before Allied Trust
Insurance settles come back.

01:17:53.572 --> 01:17:55.659
- OK. Whose are they?
- They're mine.

01:17:55.794 --> 01:17:58.311
I gotta check somethin' out
with Lena Harper's gardener.

01:17:58.354 --> 01:17:59.397
- Go on.
- I'm on it.

01:18:03.782 --> 01:18:05.766
Where's my damn address for the gardener?

01:18:05.826 --> 01:18:07.254
Hey, we're working on it.

01:18:07.948 --> 01:18:10.334
- This is Mrs. Harper's gardener?
- Yeah.

01:18:10.383 --> 01:18:11.896
You're not gonna need it.

01:18:12.956 --> 01:18:16.150
He was found, rolled, in a parking
lot of a by-the-hour motel.

01:18:16.284 --> 01:18:18.842
- Twenty-two, point blank, to the head.
- Poor guy.

01:18:19.058 --> 01:18:21.229
The blood isn't a match for the basement window.

01:18:21.401 --> 01:18:24.135
So, he isn't our stalker or, accomplice, or...

01:18:24.179 --> 01:18:26.488
whoever the hell else is behind all this.

01:18:26.523 --> 01:18:29.996
Add it to the long list of things
for me and Lem to follow up on.

01:18:30.517 --> 01:18:32.296
- Jack?
- Yeah?

01:18:33.035 --> 01:18:35.464
Would you excuse us? Private matter.

01:18:37.938 --> 01:18:39.154
Thank you.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.403
- Lem.
- Mm-hm.

01:18:44.016 --> 01:18:45.448
Gonzales came through.

01:18:45.491 --> 01:18:48.450
Fingerprints on the tumbler match the
prints on the Harpers' window sill.

01:18:48.963 --> 01:18:50.265
We got our man.

01:18:53.754 --> 01:18:57.167
- I've never seen this before.
- Doug... come on.

01:18:57.209 --> 01:18:59.162
Please, just tell us what's going on.

01:19:05.065 --> 01:19:06.324
Answer your mother.

01:19:07.105 --> 01:19:11.271
OK, I have seen them before. But not in my drawer.

01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:15.568
Look, I screwed up.

01:19:16.696 --> 01:19:21.168
OK, like-like really...
really bad kinda screwed up.

01:19:22.704 --> 01:19:25.309
- Did you kill Elliot?
- No. No, of course not. Why...?

01:19:29.935 --> 01:19:31.192
Wait right here.

01:19:39.517 --> 01:19:41.393
<i>Now, seein' you won't meet me,</i>

01:19:41.437 --> 01:19:45.039
<i>that woman'll have a warrant
when her lab work comes in.</i>

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:46.732
I just thought I owed it to you. Believe me.

01:19:47.297 --> 01:19:51.204
We weren't doubtin' you.
This whole thing... this...

01:19:53.113 --> 01:19:56.281
Can't you do something? You know what I'm saying.

01:20:00.318 --> 01:20:03.659
<i>Dougie didn't do that, Jack...</i>

01:20:03.746 --> 01:20:05.047
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:20:18.198 --> 01:20:19.370
Dougie?

01:21:06.029 --> 01:21:07.506
Come on. Come on.

01:21:15.317 --> 01:21:16.358
Doug?

01:21:17.401 --> 01:21:18.401
Lena!

01:21:33.893 --> 01:21:35.109
I have them already.

01:21:42.357 --> 01:21:43.572
Lena?

01:21:45.438 --> 01:21:48.042
Let me go, let me go! No!

01:21:48.259 --> 01:21:50.292
Hey! Get off her! Get him off her!

01:21:50.342 --> 01:21:52.077
Now, get your hands off of her!

01:21:53.815 --> 01:21:54.815
Are you OK?

01:21:56.852 --> 01:21:59.935
- Are you OK?
- Yes, thank you.

01:22:02.323 --> 01:22:03.927
Excuse me, Mrs. Harper.

01:22:04.057 --> 01:22:06.791
We're gonna need you to come
in and make a full statement.

01:22:07.963 --> 01:22:10.585
- Would you mind if I got cleaned up?
- Of course not.

01:22:10.627 --> 01:22:13.319
Oh, Jack, Jack, you know me, OK?
You gotta believe me.

01:22:13.337 --> 01:22:16.357
Dougie, I know there's gotta be a lot more
to this story, but I can't do anything.

01:22:16.401 --> 01:22:18.350
- She covered every base.
- I know.

01:22:18.368 --> 01:22:20.668
Please, I gotta get to her
before the wire transfer.

01:22:23.025 --> 01:22:26.453
Jack, I have a very small window
to help myself, here. Please.

01:22:36.392 --> 01:22:38.130
I gotta get you handcuffs.

01:22:39.647 --> 01:22:41.166
You got 20 minutes, kid.

01:22:45.116 --> 01:22:46.288
Hey, Doug!

01:22:47.243 --> 01:22:49.369
Doug! Hey, come back here!

01:23:12.131 --> 01:23:13.131
What's this?

01:23:21.748 --> 01:23:23.311
Mrs. Harper, are you ready?

01:23:23.658 --> 01:23:25.465
Doug what are-what are you doing?
Why aren't you in custody?

01:23:25.495 --> 01:23:27.577
Just wait a minute, OK? Just wait a second.

01:23:27.607 --> 01:23:29.847
- Please, just one...
- Where is Mrs. Harper?

01:23:30.299 --> 01:23:31.384
Jesus.

01:23:32.467 --> 01:23:34.681
Agent Alvarez, please, just look at this phone.

01:23:35.593 --> 01:23:37.242
It's private, she can't.

01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:39.933
Just look... please.

01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:42.234
There's proof on there.

01:23:44.666 --> 01:23:45.925
OK.

01:23:47.486 --> 01:23:48.745
Oh, my God!

01:23:53.432 --> 01:23:54.777
You need to come with me.

01:23:56.167 --> 01:23:59.816
OK. I'll take this evidence in, but
you still have a lot to answer for.

01:24:01.157 --> 01:24:02.633
Believe me, I know.

01:24:04.021 --> 01:24:05.238
Thank you.

01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:10.910
Um, hi, Sheriff, it's Alvarez.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.091
Listen. The Martin kid was telling the truth.

01:24:14.312 --> 01:24:17.042
No, I-I-I need to take her to Raleigh, right now.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.077
Uh, yeah... you sure I... can leave the kid here?

01:24:22.381 --> 01:24:26.028
Yeah, I-I got cuffs on me. Alright, just hurry.

01:24:30.759 --> 01:24:32.365
Don't do anything stupid.

01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:36.879
- It's too late.
- Let's go.

01:24:59.014 --> 01:25:00.141
Oh, my God!

01:25:00.359 --> 01:25:02.964
<i>I see the scam beneath the story.</i>

01:25:03.094 --> 01:25:05.134
<i>The way all the puzzle pieces slide together.</i>

01:25:05.176 --> 01:25:06.522
<i>That's just the way my brain works.</i>

01:25:08.911 --> 01:25:10.480
<i>She covered every base.</i>

01:25:10.515 --> 01:25:11.903
<i>Have you ever been with a girl before?</i>

01:25:12.078 --> 01:25:14.493
<i>- Maybe once or twice, but seriously?
- Did she tell you she loved you?</i>

01:25:15.029 --> 01:25:17.025
<i>- There was a matching one?
- They fit together.</i>

01:25:17.068 --> 01:25:18.429
<i>We were gonna be together someday?</i>

01:25:18.458 --> 01:25:21.247
<i>When you're young, you don't realize
the permanence of your decisions.</i>

01:25:21.495 --> 01:25:24.794
<i>Well, I'll tell you one thing. They
hate payin' out them big claims.</i>

01:25:24.836 --> 01:25:26.358
<i>How do you know she's not leadin' you on?</i>

01:25:26.835 --> 01:25:28.441
<i>I know you were obsessed with her.</i>

01:25:28.484 --> 01:25:30.804
<i>I know that your DNA will match
the blood on the window.</i>

01:25:31.218 --> 01:25:33.129
<i>No way to make that look like an accident.</i>

01:25:33.164 --> 01:25:34.995
<i>I'm dead if you go to anyone, Doug.</i>

01:25:35.297 --> 01:25:36.946
<i>I might get a second chance.</i>

01:25:37.251 --> 01:25:41.765
<i>She's gonna walk with 10 million
dollars, while someone else hangs.</i>

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.892
<i>someone else hangs...</i>

01:27:16.905 --> 01:27:18.379
<i>She said it herself.</i>

01:27:19.856 --> 01:27:21.461
<i>She stole my youth.</i>

01:27:23.648 --> 01:27:25.887
<i>But I can't pretend I didn't have a choice.</i>

01:27:28.188 --> 01:27:31.703
<i>I was locked up for a while. On... reduced charges.</i>

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.956
<i>But, it would have been much worse,
if she hadn't left me proof.</i>

01:27:37.954 --> 01:27:39.474
<i>Last I heard, they were still tracking them.</i>

01:27:39.491 --> 01:27:41.877
<i>But me? I'm still here.</i>

01:27:42.832 --> 01:27:44.509
<i>I'm not the same, though.</i>

01:27:45.915 --> 01:27:49.624
<i>I'd like to say I wish I could go back
in time, do everything differently.</i>

01:27:51.236 --> 01:27:53.014
<i>But then I remember her...</i>

01:27:54.187 --> 01:27:56.226
<i>her face, her body...</i>

01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:58.916
<i>The way I never knew what she was thinking.</i>

01:27:59.784 --> 01:28:02.953
<i>And I wonder, even if I could take it all back...</i>

01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:04.863
<i>would I?</i>

01:28:07.381 --> 01:28:08.639
Would you?
