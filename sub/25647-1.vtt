11:04.058 --> 11:07.438
A cousin of mine decided
to race a jackrabbit.

11:07.563 --> 11:10.483
Everyone told him, "You're crazy.

11:10.566 --> 11:13.068
A turtle ain't built for speed."

11:13.194 --> 11:15.321
But he went ahead anyway.

11:15.571 --> 11:19.408
And, you know,
the darnedest thing happened.

11:19.492 --> 11:21.118
-[croaks]
-Just going to spitball here...

11:21.202 --> 11:24.288
Um...
The turtle got to the finish line first.

11:24.371 --> 11:27.082
Nope. Never saw him again. [chuckles]

11:27.208 --> 11:31.295
Crazy varmint had no sense of direction.

11:31.378 --> 11:33.214
[both laughing]

11:33.339 --> 11:35.341
-That's a good one, Larry.
-Peng!

11:35.424 --> 11:36.259
Whoa! Whee!

11:38.261 --> 11:40.472
-I am not a frog.
-Sorry, Larry.

11:40.805 --> 11:42.641
-You okay?
-I'm all right.

11:42.891 --> 11:45.310
Feel fine. Cleared my sinuses.

from a talking rock.

11:52.859 --> 11:54.861
[croaking]

12:00.450 --> 12:02.077
Just to recap, flock.

12:02.202 --> 12:03.578
This is not a drill.

12:03.662 --> 12:06.791
The chances of fatality at this point
are exceptionally slim.

12:06.916 --> 12:09.585
Only one in five of us are likely to die.

12:11.462 --> 12:12.296
Aah!

12:12.380 --> 12:16.342
Excellent form, recruits.
Just like a V. Keep calm, keep the V.

12:16.842 --> 12:20.388
All right, flock. Keep it loose.
Fly like a goose. [laughs]

12:20.471 --> 12:22.765
-I'm kidding. Keep the V.
-Sorry I'm late.

12:22.848 --> 12:25.726
JingJing, I was really worried
about you for a second there.

12:25.810 --> 12:28.771
Sorry, Dad. I really tried
to talk some sense into Peng.

12:28.854 --> 12:33.401
Sense into Peng?
Be easier to train a frog to fly. [laughs]

12:33.484 --> 12:35.487
-[fluttering]
-No offense, Chauncy.

Frazier, it seems the new mother
is unable to fly.

17:32.543 --> 17:36.715
Yes, indeed, Giles.
I do believe she's a "lame duck."

17:37.215 --> 17:39.843
-"Goose," actually.
-What a terrible thing it is

17:39.926 --> 17:43.805
-to be injured in the wild.
-Oh, yeah. It's deadly, I understand.

17:43.889 --> 17:47.767
Yes, a lone goose could be reduced
to <i>foie gras</i> in mere moments.

a little rough at times, but--

-We know what you're up to.
-Yes, we do. What is he up to?

18:08.664 --> 18:11.667
You simply want us around,
so that you're not a sitting duck.

-"Goose."
-Goose! Goose!

All I'm saying is, the three of us...
If we were to walk to the Haven together,

18:17.673 --> 18:19.300
that would be all right? Right?

Walk? On these spindly legs?
Have you gone absolutely mad, sir?

18:23.054 --> 18:25.848

to travel on foot,

You're thinking,
"If only I had a companion. Some trusty friend to walk with me."
Am I right?

18:50.248 --> 18:53.961
-Thanks, but...
-Hey. I know turtles don't migrate.

Wait a minute. What I need is something
that can throw the bad guys off my scent.

19:12.605 --> 19:14.524
An insurance policy. That's...

19:15.191 --> 19:19.821
Oh. I don't need to be faster
than a predator.

19:19.904 --> 19:24.701

-Why are you helping us, all of a sudden?

Why? [chuckles] Because I'm doing it
from the bottom of my heart. Okay?

Okay. Fine, fine.
If you don't want my help... off you go.

from the heart of his bottom.

20:48.454 --> 20:51.040
That's right.
That's just the kind of goose I am.

20:51.123 --> 20:54.460
I've always gone around helping people,
trying to do the right thing.

20:54.543 --> 20:58.047
[whimpers] You know? Maybe help a couple
of ducklings that are lost,

20:58.130 --> 21:01.258
and they just want to find their way back
to their flock.

21:01.342 --> 21:03.845
And maybe put a little piece
of the burden

21:03.929 --> 21:05.680
of the world on my shoulders.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.641
Oh, Mom! Can I ride on your shoulders?

21:07.724 --> 21:09.059
Not a chance. Get off me.

21:10.477 --> 21:11.311
Let's go.

21:12.687 --> 21:14.689
Come on. Let's pick up the pace.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.858
[Chao pants]

21:17.067 --> 21:18.985
Wait! Okay? Would you wait up?

21:19.903 --> 21:22.781
Just because you're helping us,
doesn't make you the boss.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.908
Yes, it does.

21:24.991 --> 21:28.870
And since I'm the boss,
you're gonna have to go by my rules.

21:29.371 --> 21:32.082
I'm just spitballing here,
rule number one:

21:32.165 --> 21:33.793
whatever I say goes.

21:34.836 --> 21:35.920
Goes where?

21:36.003 --> 21:36.879
[sighs]

21:38.756 --> 21:41.217
Okay. You know what? Rule number two:

21:41.300 --> 21:44.262
-no questions about rule number one.
-Okay, Mom.

21:44.345 --> 21:45.972
All right. Rule number three:

21:46.055 --> 21:50.393
don't call me mommy, mom,
mama, mama mia, mother,

21:50.476 --> 21:52.103
anything that starts with "m."

21:52.186 --> 21:54.730
-You got it?
-Got it. Jerk feathers.

21:55.398 --> 21:56.566
-Any more rules?
-Yes.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.902
Rule number four: we walk fast,
there's no whining or complaining,

21:59.986 --> 22:01.946
eyes are front all the time,

22:02.029 --> 22:05.909
and most of all, never, ever, wander off.

22:06.118 --> 22:08.287
-You're so stupid.
-No, you're stupid.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.164
-Stupid infinity.
-You're stupider.

22:10.247 --> 22:12.457

You're stupid, stupid, stupid,

22:15.085 --> 22:16.712
multiplied by stupid.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.839
-Okay, that's stupid.
-At least I'm not a duck.

22:18.922 --> 22:22.134
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You know what it... Where's Chao?

22:22.217 --> 22:24.303
-He wandered off.
-Are you kidding?

-Now, then. Down to business.

23:05.721 --> 23:07.681
Where did the goose go?

23:09.725 --> 23:14.146
Peng's my friend.
I'll take that information to the grave.

23:14.230 --> 23:15.064
Okay.

23:15.648 --> 23:19.443
[gasps] Peng hurt his wing,
so he has to walk to the Haven.

23:20.402 --> 23:21.737
He can't fly?

23:21.862 --> 23:25.491
The goose can't fly!

Remember this meeting.
I'm sure I will.

23:42.634 --> 23:44.803
I've got turtle recall.

23:45.095 --> 23:47.639
"Turtle recall," that was a good one.

23:47.722 --> 23:48.640
Why, thank you.

23:48.723 --> 23:49.557
Don't mention it.

23:49.641 --> 23:51.017
-What?
-This isn't good.

23:51.101 --> 23:53.436
I have to warn Peng right away.

23:54.771 --> 23:57.107

with your flock.

wandering off all the time,

he behaves with... What?

In case you have poor vision,
his face is... funny.

24:43.572 --> 24:44.448

24:48.243 --> 24:50.329

24:51.705 --> 24:53.832
Okay. New plan.

24:54.541 --> 24:56.710
New plan?
I didn't know we had an old plan.

24:58.879 --> 24:59.713
What?

25:04.927 --> 25:08.973
We'll cut across country
and join the road further down.

25:09.182 --> 25:10.767
But we'll be going the wrong way. We may be going the wrong way,

25:12.518 --> 25:14.729
but we'll be headed
in the right direction.

25:14.812 --> 25:16.981
What're you saying?
That makes no sense.

25:17.148 --> 25:19.525
[sighs] Look, I'm a migrating goose.

25:19.692 --> 25:22.195
I have excellent instincts,
so from here on out,

25:22.278 --> 25:24.906
we're gonna travel as the crow flies. But, but, but...

25:27.700 --> 25:30.078
-But we can't fly.
-No, no, no.

25:30.161 --> 25:33.957
I mean, as the crow flies.
It's a way of saying...

25:35.042 --> 25:37.920
[shouts] Look. It's just a saying! Okay?

[Chi] Yeah. Rice paddies.

[flock honking]

26:03.029 --> 26:05.949
Okay, flocks. Remember
to fly straight and steady.

26:06.032 --> 26:08.034
Fly into the cloud, not around it.

26:08.118 --> 26:10.662
If you get hit by lightning,
the correct procedure is

26:10.745 --> 26:13.123

-What's going on?
-Sorry, Dad.

26:22.507 --> 26:26.136
-I'm just worried about Peng.
-Ah, JingJing. How can I reassure you?

26:26.219 --> 26:28.888
Don't feel bad
that you couldn't persuade him to come.

26:28.972 --> 26:31.767
He'll hunker down,
and we'll see him next spring.

26:31.851 --> 26:35.020
-For sure.
-Yes, good. You know what? You're right.

26:35.104 --> 26:37.565
-Course, he'll be long dead by then.
-What? Dead?

26:37.648 --> 26:39.358
Mummified skeleton, probably.

26:39.442 --> 26:41.360
-But we'll see him, is the point.
-What?

26:41.444 --> 26:45.865
-If the foxes don't get his bones first.
-Did you just say "foxes"? What?

26:46.866 --> 26:49.618
He'll be fine. He knows what he's doing.

26:52.037 --> 26:55.332
Come on... All right.
Where's your sense of fun? [chuckles]

26:55.458 --> 26:59.837
-It'll be a hop, skip, and a jump.
-Fun. Yeah. Right.

They were lost in the thick, murky fog,

31:54.683 --> 31:56.685

31:56.769 --> 31:59.898
they couldn't see an inch
in front of their faces...

We're never gonna find our way
out of this.

32:02.442 --> 32:06.571
-We'll have to cross the river.
-But that's not safe either. Is it?

32:09.115 --> 32:10.283

32:12.660 --> 32:14.913
To get to the other side?

32:15.288 --> 32:16.831
No. You know, because...

-Because if they don't, we'll never--

-[Chi screaming]

46:27.585 --> 46:28.920
[both laughing]

46:29.003 --> 46:31.005
[Peng shouting] Look out!

46:33.716 --> 46:35.760
[Peng] I'm okay. I'm all right.

46:36.469 --> 46:38.596
Luckily, I landed on something soft.

46:38.680 --> 46:39.931
[Chi] Yeah. Us.

46:40.014 --> 46:42.850
-[Chi] You nincompoop.
-[Chao] You got a big butt.

46:42.934 --> 46:45.603
-[Peng] I do not have a big butt.
-[Chi chuckles]

46:45.687 --> 46:48.147
I have very thin legs.

46:48.356 --> 46:50.191
Anyway. Come on. Let's go.

46:50.274 --> 46:53.569
I know this is all fun and games,
but the leaves mean winter is coming,

46:53.654 --> 46:57.157
so we gotta go.
And winter means snow,

46:57.533 --> 46:59.827
and snow is not our friend.

46:59.910 --> 47:02.329
-[Chi laughing]
-[Peng] Brrr!

47:02.413 --> 47:04.498
[babbling] That's it. Game's over.

47:04.915 --> 47:09.211
I'm gonna count to three and if you're not
up here, you don't even want to know.

47:09.294 --> 47:12.548
-One. I said, "One." Two...
-[ducklings laughing]

47:12.631 --> 47:14.007
All right, three-- [gasps]

47:14.758 --> 47:16.969
-[ducklings laughing]
-You little piranhas.

47:17.845 --> 47:18.887
Gotcha!

47:19.680 --> 47:22.141
-Looks like you messed with the...
-[Chi laughing]

47:22.474 --> 47:23.935
-[frog croaking]
-Chi?

47:24.853 --> 47:26.104
-Yeah?
-Where's Chao?

47:26.187 --> 47:27.355
Uh...

47:27.689 --> 47:29.899
He wandered off. Again.

47:30.108 --> 47:32.736
Outstanding work, flock.
We made it to the waypoint

47:32.819 --> 47:33.945
with no losses.

47:34.028 --> 47:36.573
Except for Peng, that is,
but we're not giving up yet.

47:36.656 --> 47:38.450
Birds of a feather, migrate together.

47:38.533 --> 47:40.827
[all] Birds of a feather,
migrate together.

47:40.910 --> 47:41.745
Never give up!

47:42.162 --> 47:44.164
-Peng's never coming back, JingJing.
-What?

47:44.247 --> 47:45.540
He... He never deserved you.

47:45.665 --> 47:48.626
-Dad, we've talked about this before.
-If I may, young lady?

47:48.710 --> 47:50.295
You need a gander who's strong,

47:50.378 --> 47:53.883
accompanied by an infallible intellect,
and a side order of humility.

47:53.966 --> 47:56.177
But a big, big side order.

47:56.260 --> 47:59.555
-Someone like-- Someone like your dad.
-He is like you, Dad.

47:59.638 --> 48:02.099
I've been trying to tell you.
He's handsome.

48:02.183 --> 48:03.058
Handsome?

48:03.142 --> 48:06.604
He's strong. Sure, he's reckless,
and a bit of a show-off.

48:06.687 --> 48:08.230
-Well...
-But deep down,

48:08.314 --> 48:12.401
underneath that narcissistic,
annoying exterior...

48:12.485 --> 48:14.153
-I--
-Wait. Narcissistic?

48:14.236 --> 48:17.198
I don't know why I like Peng, Dad.
It's weird.

48:17.323 --> 48:20.201
-The heart wants.
-What the heart wants.

48:20.326 --> 48:23.246
It's as clear as the beak on my face.

48:23.330 --> 48:26.374
No daughter of mine's saddling up
with that sad excuse for a gander.

48:26.458 --> 48:28.752
You just try and stop me, Daddy.

48:30.545 --> 48:31.379
Oh!

48:31.463 --> 48:34.007
-Awkward.
-Good afternoon, ladies.

48:36.176 --> 48:37.719
[both] Ladies?

48:38.595 --> 48:40.597
[wind blowing]

48:41.765 --> 48:43.934
-You don't think he's...
-Yeah.

48:44.017 --> 48:45.769
-For reals?
-Totally.

48:45.977 --> 48:46.812
Really?

48:48.021 --> 48:49.898
-[shouts] Chao?
-[echo repeating]

48:52.609 --> 48:56.113
He's not in there. See?
He's got more sense than to go in to some

48:56.197 --> 48:58.533
creepy, dark, scary cave.

48:58.616 --> 49:02.453
-[Chao from a distance] <i> This is so cool.</i>
<i>-</i> [echo repeating]

49:03.162 --> 49:04.163
Oh, geez.

49:04.455 --> 49:05.873
Okay, we gotta go get him.

49:06.249 --> 49:10.002
[stammers]
Let me present something to you.

49:12.755 --> 49:14.882
-How much do you like your brother?
-A lot.

49:15.550 --> 49:17.718
-Okay? I like him a lot.
-But, but...

49:17.802 --> 49:22.598
What you have to understand is,
this is a sub, underground enviro.

49:22.682 --> 49:25.978
-I'm used to being above it all.
-[echo repeating]

49:26.687 --> 49:29.189
-That didn't come out right.
-Mm-hmm.

49:30.190 --> 49:33.402
All right. Fine.
We'll go in and get the little stinker.

49:39.783 --> 49:42.619
No, no, no. It's just
that we're underground. It's dark.

49:42.703 --> 49:46.248
It's smelly. It's...
Great, we're gonna die.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.836
-Chao!
-[echo repeating]

49:51.044 --> 49:53.298
-Chi!
-[echo repeating]

49:53.381 --> 49:54.257
He's this way.

49:55.842 --> 49:58.386
N-Not so fast! Wait for me.

49:59.470 --> 50:03.933
I have goosebumps on my goosebumps,
and I'm a goose, for Pete's sake.

50:05.184 --> 50:07.186
Fine. Fine. I'm fine.

50:07.312 --> 50:09.647
-[Peng] Nothing to worry about.
-[Chi] Are you sure?

50:09.731 --> 50:10.732
Yeah. [Peng screams]

50:10.815 --> 50:13.318
-What was that? Something just touched me.
-What is it?

50:13.401 --> 50:16.154
[Peng]
I don't know. It's slimy and smelly and...

50:16.779 --> 50:19.782
[Peng sighs in relief and laughs]
It's just Chao.

50:19.866 --> 50:22.661
[Chao in distance]
Guys, you've gotta come see this.

50:23.162 --> 50:25.039
[Peng gasps]

50:25.164 --> 50:29.335
-[goofy voice] Will you be my buddy?
-[screams in fear] Wait for me!

50:29.877 --> 50:30.836
Mommy! [grunts]

50:33.172 --> 50:34.548
-[hollow thud]
-Ow!

50:37.134 --> 50:38.218
[Chi] Wow!

50:39.845 --> 50:43.682
Wow! It's like... It's like stars.

50:45.476 --> 50:47.603
[Chi] I think they're glowworms.

50:47.770 --> 50:49.021
[jingling]

50:49.104 --> 50:50.481
Glowworms?

50:50.898 --> 50:53.985
How do... How do they glow like that?

50:54.069 --> 50:57.197
Well, it's actually two chemicals
reacting in their bellies.

50:57.364 --> 50:59.282
-[hiccups]
-[Peng] Why would you know that?

51:00.075 --> 51:01.701
[Chao farts, gasps]

51:01.785 --> 51:04.120
Gross. I gotta go swim or something.

51:04.204 --> 51:05.205
Spicy.

51:06.873 --> 51:09.376
-Chao, look.
-Oh. It looks like us.

51:09.834 --> 51:12.504
-[ducklings laughing]
-[both gasp]

51:12.587 --> 51:14.506
[Peng laughs] Gotcha.

51:16.132 --> 51:19.010
"Oh, Peng. My friend and I would like
to have a word with you."

51:19.094 --> 51:20.220
Hey, I remember them.

51:20.303 --> 51:21.972
-[ducklings chuckle]
-[Peng] Bla, bla...

51:22.055 --> 51:23.015
"Goose, actually."

51:23.099 --> 51:26.686
[Peng imitating Larry] "I'm a turtle.
Sounds like I have a frog in my throat."

51:27.144 --> 51:28.479
[retches] Ribbit.

51:28.562 --> 51:30.564
[all laughing]

51:31.524 --> 51:34.860
-[Peng] Wow, that's pretty cool, Chi.
-I'm not doing that one.

51:35.277 --> 51:37.029
-[Peng] Pretty good, Chao.
-That's not me.

51:37.113 --> 51:40.866
But if you didn't do it,
and he's not doing it,

51:40.950 --> 51:43.536
-and I'm definitely not doing--
-[screech]

51:43.828 --> 51:46.580
All my favorites in one place.

51:46.664 --> 51:48.457
Duck, duck, goose.

51:48.541 --> 51:49.834
Guys, run.

51:49.917 --> 51:51.127
[Chao wails]

51:51.919 --> 51:53.964
[Banzou hissing]

51:54.381 --> 51:56.174
[Peng huffs and puffs]

51:58.301 --> 52:02.848
-[Chao] Where did they go?
-[Chi] Peng? Where are you guys?

52:03.390 --> 52:04.224
-Chi?
-Chao?

52:04.307 --> 52:06.268
-Where are you?
-Peng?

52:06.351 --> 52:09.479
[Banzou roars] Dead goose! Hear me?

52:10.731 --> 52:12.816
-[Chao] Peng?
-[Chi] Peng, we need to go.

52:12.983 --> 52:15.360
The cat is gonna get us. He's after us!

52:15.444 --> 52:19.156
[Banzou in singsong voice, echoing]
Ducklings, come out to play.

52:21.116 --> 52:23.286
All right. Which way is out of here?

52:24.412 --> 52:25.621
-[boings]
-Owie!

52:26.164 --> 52:28.374
-What are you doing?
-You'll see.

52:29.375 --> 52:31.502
This way. Come on. Hurry.

52:31.753 --> 52:33.755
[Chao hiccups]

52:38.134 --> 52:39.427
[Banzou] Oh, ducklings.

52:40.678 --> 52:43.473
-Come out, come out, wherever you are.
-[echo repeating]

52:45.558 --> 52:48.019
This way. Come on. Hurry.

52:48.519 --> 52:49.729
That's the way out.

52:49.854 --> 52:52.941
[Banzou laughs]
You can't "duck" me forever.

52:53.275 --> 52:55.652
Up you go. Hey, I'm right here.

52:55.736 --> 52:58.030
Keep going. Fast as you can.

52:58.447 --> 52:59.823
[Banzou snarls]

52:59.948 --> 53:02.826
-[Chi] I can't do it.
-[Peng] Yes, you can. Keep going.

53:02.910 --> 53:04.495
[Banzou] Ready or not.

53:04.578 --> 53:05.579
Come on, come on!

53:05.662 --> 53:07.372
[Banzou changes voice] We're coming.

53:07.456 --> 53:08.332
[Peng] Hurry!

53:08.415 --> 53:10.417
[Banzou snarls] [ducklings and Peng scream]

53:13.128 --> 53:15.130
[they shriek]

53:23.640 --> 53:28.144
[Peng laughs] Guys,
I have a bad feeling about th-i-i-i-s...!

53:28.228 --> 53:30.897
Argh! Whoa!

53:31.606 --> 53:33.650
That was it? <i> </i> [laughs]

53:33.775 --> 53:36.111
I thought it was going to be bigg--
[screams]

53:36.194 --> 53:37.654
[waterfall thunders]

53:37.779 --> 53:42.117
[Chao shouting] This is not go-o-o-o-d!

53:42.742 --> 53:44.744
[river churns] -[Chi gasps]
-[Peng coughs]

53:49.374 --> 53:51.377
[all panting]

53:51.794 --> 53:53.963
[Chao chuckles]

53:55.047 --> 53:57.133
-[Chi] I'm dizzy.
-[Chao] This is so cool.

53:57.216 --> 54:01.137
-Chi! Peng!
-[Chi] I need to lie down.

54:02.847 --> 54:04.431
[Peng and Chi huff and puff]

54:04.515 --> 54:05.432
I feel sick.

54:05.516 --> 54:08.894
-I don't know what to feel.
-Chi, look at me! Cannonball!

54:09.478 --> 54:12.398
Am I crazy
or is your brother indestructible?

54:12.481 --> 54:14.233
-[Chao] Check this out!
-Using air currents?

54:14.316 --> 54:15.693
That was pretty genius.

54:15.776 --> 54:18.571
Yeah, well,
that's a little thing I invented.

54:18.779 --> 54:22.367
I tried to show my flock,
but they weren't ready for it yet.

54:25.579 --> 54:28.582
It's the road. It's the road!
You found the road!

54:28.665 --> 54:31.918
-You did it, Peng. You really did it!
-[Chao laughing]

54:32.085 --> 54:33.461
[Chi] Whoo-hoo!

54:33.545 --> 54:36.298
-[Chi] Yes! We're going home!
-[Chao] All right! -[Chi laughs]
-[Peng] Well, how 'bout that?

54:39.217 --> 54:42.137
-I told you I'd get you here, right?
-Yeah!

54:43.388 --> 54:44.264
[Chi chuckles]

54:44.389 --> 54:47.142
You know, I always trust my instincts. All we gotta do is cross the river,
hit the road,

54:50.103 --> 54:52.481
and I'm sure we'll catch up
with your flock.

54:54.525 --> 54:58.362
-Chi? Is Pleasant Valley really home?
-What?

54:58.487 --> 55:01.073
I don't know if I want to go
back to the others now.

55:01.157 --> 55:06.495
-Chao, you can't be serious.
-Well, we are kind of a family, aren't we?

55:06.996 --> 55:09.707
-You've imprinted, haven't you?
-I didn't mean to.

55:09.790 --> 55:10.625
[Chi chuckles]

55:14.462 --> 55:16.923
-[distant honking]
-My flock. Guys. Guys!

55:17.006 --> 55:18.758
Guys, wait for me!

55:18.883 --> 55:20.802
It's me! It's me.

55:21.470 --> 55:22.304
-Please.
-[honking]

55:22.387 --> 55:25.807
All right, flock. Time to wander
into the deep blue yonder.

55:25.891 --> 55:30.145
-Where's he going?
-Peng? Where are you going?

55:30.312 --> 55:32.314
[Peng honks and pants]

55:35.525 --> 55:37.319
Please. Wait.

55:37.444 --> 55:39.446
[geese honking]

55:40.322 --> 55:41.657
What's up with Peng?

55:41.907 --> 55:43.408
I don't know.

55:44.451 --> 55:47.913
Peng. What is it? What's going on?
What's wrong?

55:47.996 --> 55:49.331
[pants] What's...

55:49.790 --> 55:53.503
What's wrong? Didn't you see?
That was my flock.

55:53.586 --> 55:55.171
I could've caught up with them.

55:55.255 --> 55:57.507
But at every turn,
you guys slow me down.

55:57.632 --> 56:02.178
How am I going to get to the Haven now?
Should have left you with the pigs.

56:02.262 --> 56:05.223
-You were going to leave us?
-He was gonna leave us

56:05.306 --> 56:06.766
whenever it suited him, Chao.

56:06.849 --> 56:08.476
I got you to your road. Okay?

56:08.559 --> 56:12.272
This whole time you weren't helping us,
you were using us.

56:12.355 --> 56:15.566
Yes. No, not-- At the beginning I...

56:15.858 --> 56:17.819
I found your road, okay?

56:17.902 --> 56:20.406
Look. I gotta go.

56:21.365 --> 56:25.160
You know what, Peng?
Your instincts stink.

56:26.787 --> 56:27.746
Come on, Chao.

56:33.877 --> 56:36.422
[tearfully] Don't go, Mom. Please.

56:37.464 --> 56:38.924
I said come on, Chao.

56:39.758 --> 56:40.592
Forget him.

Guys! Guys, wait!

57:06.661 --> 57:08.163
[branch crashes]

57:08.246 --> 57:10.623
Wait! No!

57:12.751 --> 57:15.503
Oh, no! [grunts]
[shouts] Come back, you guys!

57:15.587 --> 57:16.629
Aah!

57:17.505 --> 57:19.549
[whimpers, groans]

57:19.632 --> 57:23.304
[shouting] Somebody help. Wait! Come back!

57:39.320 --> 57:41.364
Tada! [laughs]

57:41.447 --> 57:45.701
-Another perfect landing, man.
-Wait, are you a squirrel?

57:46.827 --> 57:49.538
You know what?
I'm not really into labels <i>per se?</i>

57:49.622 --> 57:52.584
I find them limiting.
Like, I wouldn't call you a badger.

57:52.667 --> 57:55.128
That's because I'm not a badger.

57:55.212 --> 57:57.756
Yeah. So you see what I'm talking about?

57:57.839 --> 57:58.715
Right on.

57:59.132 --> 58:02.094
-Hey, I'm Carl. Bring it in, brah.
-Ow!

58:02.177 --> 58:06.556
Hey. Wait a second. Yes.
Definitely picking up on a negative aura

58:06.640 --> 58:08.558
around this general wing area.

58:08.642 --> 58:11.520
Yeah. It's called pain.
I've injured my wing.

58:11.645 --> 58:14.398
Dude, this is your lucky, lucky day.

58:14.481 --> 58:17.901
Lucky for you,
I am artful in the ways of healing.

58:17.984 --> 58:20.530
-<i>Qigong,</i> man.
-Chi what?

58:20.613 --> 58:26.119
-Is that "goodbye" in squirrel?
-Hey. You don't have any cookies, do you?

58:26.369 --> 58:27.620
Cookies? No.

58:27.703 --> 58:31.082
Wait, go back to the...
Did you say you could fix my wing?

58:31.165 --> 58:35.169
Why? What happened to your wing?
Oh, yeah, right, your wing.

58:35.336 --> 58:36.838
Totally. Yes.

58:36.921 --> 58:40.591
Brace yourself
because this is a four-step process.

58:40.716 --> 58:42.760
First, is stimulation. -Stimulation? Ow! Ouch!
-[wing cracks]

58:45.012 --> 58:47.306
-Followed by... manipulation.
-What?

58:47.432 --> 58:50.519
[loud howl of pain echoes]

58:50.602 --> 58:53.897
Then, a simple case of aggravation.

58:54.022 --> 58:55.774
-[wing cracks]
-[groans in pain]

58:56.483 --> 58:59.403
And finally, the <i>pièce de résistance...</i>

58:59.987 --> 59:02.030
-incapacitation.
-Inca--?

59:02.114 --> 59:03.323
[rapid twittering]

59:03.407 --> 59:04.450
Goodnight, badger.

59:04.908 --> 59:06.910
[birds hoot, insects chirrup]

59:08.454 --> 59:11.039
[Chi sighs]
We're never gonna find our way through.

59:11.331 --> 59:12.833
What are we going to do?

59:12.916 --> 59:15.210
I guess we're just gonna
have to cross the river.

59:15.294 --> 59:16.128
[Chao gasps]

59:16.211 --> 59:18.839
-What is it?
-This is just like Peng's story.

59:18.964 --> 59:22.135
Yeah, well, he's good at making things up.

59:24.345 --> 59:27.891
-No, Chi. Really.
-Come on. There's no such things as--

59:27.974 --> 59:29.684
[water gurgles and bubbles]

59:30.560 --> 59:31.811
...m-monsters.

59:31.895 --> 59:34.397
It's j-just a turtle, right?
It's got to be.

59:42.155 --> 59:45.617
-[low rumble]
-[owl hooting] -I don't like it. Let's go back.
-Yeah.

59:51.040 --> 59:53.792
Chao? Which way's back?

59:54.001 --> 59:55.377
Um...

59:55.961 --> 59:59.632
[gasps] Look, Chi. It looks like... It is!

59:59.715 --> 01:00:01.383
I can see the other side.

01:00:01.926 --> 01:00:03.928
[rippling in water]

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.225
Um, Chi?

01:00:11.769 --> 01:00:13.020
[both screaming]

01:00:13.103 --> 01:00:16.232
-[screams]
-Badger! You're awake.

01:00:16.315 --> 01:00:20.320
-What have you done? Why?
-Duh. I'm healing your wing, brah.

01:00:20.403 --> 01:00:22.322
That's the wrong wing!

01:00:22.405 --> 01:00:23.323
Oh...

01:00:23.448 --> 01:00:25.283
<i>Uno momentito,</i> dudu.

01:00:25.367 --> 01:00:28.119
-[mutters to himself]
-[Peng] Ouch, ouch!

01:00:28.245 --> 01:00:29.204
All right.

01:00:29.287 --> 01:00:31.790
-Wait, did you hear a sheep?
-What?

01:00:32.082 --> 01:00:34.251
-No.
-Neither did I.

01:00:34.834 --> 01:00:38.213
[Peng] What are you doing? What?
[yelps]

01:00:38.296 --> 01:00:41.550
-[shouts] Ouch!
-Easy there, big guy.

01:00:41.633 --> 01:00:42.467
What the--?

01:00:42.551 --> 01:00:45.512
Hey. You gotta chill your splints, badger.
Sit down.

01:00:45.595 --> 01:00:48.723
-Are you sure this is gonna work?
-<i>No problemo,</i> man.

01:00:48.807 --> 01:00:51.018
I'm a healer. It's what I do.

01:00:51.102 --> 01:00:53.020
It's worked on all of my buddies.

01:00:53.104 --> 01:00:54.438
Your buddies?

01:00:54.522 --> 01:00:58.568
Oh. So you're not the only squirrel
up here, then?

01:00:58.651 --> 01:01:01.487
Squirrels? <i> </i> [laughs]

01:01:01.612 --> 01:01:02.989
Squirrels!

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.827
Man, these...  These aren't squirrels.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.161
Are you crazy?

01:01:10.246 --> 01:01:14.625
[sighs] Squirrels. Yeah. There used
to be a whole bunch of us.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:18.004
Flying around, having fun. But then...

01:01:18.462 --> 01:01:20.966
-they left.
-Oh, really? Wonder why.

01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:24.261
Oh, you know.
They met girls, started families.

01:01:24.886 --> 01:01:27.806
-Can you believe they did that to me?
-Surprising.

01:01:27.889 --> 01:01:32.352
I said to my friend Rocky, I was like,
"Hey, Rocky, great for you and the moose,

01:01:32.477 --> 01:01:35.272
but now what am I going to do
on Tuesday nights, huh?"

01:01:35.647 --> 01:01:39.526
-Can't imagine why they'd leave.
-That's what I said!

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:42.321
Well, now they're all miserable
with their kids.

01:01:42.404 --> 01:01:43.322
They are?

01:01:43.405 --> 01:01:47.117
Well, you know,
they say they're happy, but come on.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.954
All kids do is eat, poop, and complain.

01:01:50.079 --> 01:01:53.541
-Right?
-Yeah. You got that right.

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:57.462
[sniffs] Urgh! That burns me nose hairs.

01:01:58.171 --> 01:02:00.465
What the--? This is nuts. I gotta get...

01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:04.177
[stammers] Forget the kids.
I gotta get to the Haven.

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.971
What? Hold the mail, man.

01:02:07.055 --> 01:02:08.431
You live in the spa?

01:02:08.931 --> 01:02:11.643
-Hey. You think you could get me in?
-You?

01:02:11.726 --> 01:02:14.103
I could... You know, why not?
All right, fine.

01:02:14.187 --> 01:02:15.897
[laughs]

01:02:16.022 --> 01:02:18.274
Yeah, man. That's awesome.

01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:20.903
The winters up here can be so gnarly.

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:23.530
Like last year, my nuts froze.

01:02:24.156 --> 01:02:26.492
-Huh?
-Wait. What kids?

01:02:26.867 --> 01:02:28.869
[both panting]

01:02:31.205 --> 01:02:34.500
[Chi] It's all right. It's okay.
We're fine. Everything's fine.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:01.695
Carl, I don't get this. How is hanging
from a branch supposed to heal me?

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:05.198
Dude, you just reach out your arms
like they're wings.

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:08.159
What do you mean "like wings"?
They <i>are</i> wings.

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:10.745
Pretend you haven't got any.
Then pretend you do.

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:12.831
Then let go of the branch.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:16.042
Let go?
Carl, I can't fly. Remember?

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.961
My wing is totally messed up.

01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:21.048
Dude, flying is all about taking the leap.

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:23.008
I know what flying is, Carl.

01:03:23.134 --> 01:03:25.553
It's the falling I'm worried about.

01:03:25.636 --> 01:03:28.347
No, it's the hitting the ground
I'm worried about.

01:03:28.431 --> 01:03:30.349
Slow your roll, Mr. Worrynuts.

01:03:30.433 --> 01:03:33.018
What could go wrong?
You're tied to that rope.

01:03:33.102 --> 01:03:36.647
Dude, it's all mental,
except for the physical part.

01:03:36.731 --> 01:03:37.857
[Peng sighs]

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.609
Okay, Peng.  You can do this.

01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:41.861
Here we go.

to Pleasant Valley.
