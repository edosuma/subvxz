WEBVTT

00:18.406 --> 00:19.722
Is that the time?
Oh my god.

00:19.722 --> 00:21.739
It's almost 2 O'clock.
My parents are gonna kill me.

00:21.739 --> 00:24.076
Chill! One more dance.

00:24.076 --> 00:26.344
You don't know my parents.
Come on.

00:55.495 --> 00:56.620
Mom!

00:57.326 --> 00:58.680
Dad!

01:13.376 --> 01:14.858
Mom!

01:34.536 --> 01:35.926
Both parents?

01:35.926 --> 01:37.634
Girl came home,
found them both dead.

01:37.634 --> 01:39.769
Suspect probably came in
through the back window.

01:39.769 --> 01:41.054
Okay. / Window slashed.

01:41.054 --> 01:42.267
all right

01:43.285 --> 01:45.201
Aw, you're shivering.

01:45.889 --> 01:47.310
Here you go sweetheart.

01:47.310 --> 01:48.643
There you go.

01:48.643 --> 01:49.877
Okay.

01:50.541 --> 01:51.663
All right, here's what I want you to do.

01:51.663 --> 01:54.027
I want you to go and sit
and wait for me in my car.

01:54.027 --> 01:55.898
Okay? Could you do that?

01:58.474 --> 01:59.920
Okay?

02:05.265 --> 02:06.676
Alexx.

02:07.609 --> 02:09.640
Blood pool's dry at the edges.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.873
Put's TOD at around eleven.

02:13.672 --> 02:16.704
So our head is literally
hanging by a thread of skin.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.517
Single edged knife.

02:18.517 --> 02:20.034
Mom was attacked from behind,

02:20.034 --> 02:21.829
sliced left to right.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.885
No indication of resistance.

02:25.885 --> 02:27.446
She was probably asleep.

02:27.446 --> 02:29.235
He transected all the neck muscles,

02:29.235 --> 02:32.339
down to the second cervical axis.

02:33.382 --> 02:35.659
He decapitated her, Alexx.

02:35.659 --> 02:37.834
Guy's a monster,

02:38.201 --> 02:40.143
who doens't know his own strength.

02:40.143 --> 02:43.333
Well, he's about to know ours.

03:18.723 --> 03:21.826
MIAMI
2x23 MIA/NYC - Nonstop

03:51.010 --> 03:53.998
- What's up?
- It looks more like what's down.

03:53.998 --> 03:56.988
I'm not exactly sure but
I think someone gobbed up.

03:56.988 --> 03:58.460
You got spit?

03:59.096 --> 04:01.505
That's great.
You might have hit the jackpot.

04:03.793 --> 04:06.386
Something's not right Alexx.

04:09.286 --> 04:11.966
Point of entry is back here,

04:13.040 --> 04:14.644
but the origin of the blood drops

04:14.644 --> 04:17.937
is down here in the study
where mom was killed.

04:17.937 --> 04:19.640
And they travel up this hallway

04:19.640 --> 04:22.693
to the bedroom where
dad was eventually killed.

04:22.693 --> 04:24.931
Which means the killer
bypassed the bedroom

04:24.931 --> 04:27.370
where dad was attacked.
Why would he do that?

04:27.370 --> 04:30.159
Why wouldn't you eliminate the muscle first?

04:30.159 --> 04:31.942
That would have been the smart move.

04:31.942 --> 04:33.600
Why do you think he didn't?

04:33.933 --> 04:36.266
Dad, survives the attack,

04:36.266 --> 04:38.121
he managed to get up,

04:38.419 --> 04:39.735
come this way,

04:39.735 --> 04:43.435
and head down the hall toward you right?

04:43.760 --> 04:45.995
And along here, you see,

04:45.995 --> 04:47.986
arterial gushing.

04:51.993 --> 04:56.291
Where our suspect sank
this sucker in him.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.364
Single-edged all right.

04:58.831 --> 05:00.446
Phone's right here.

05:00.446 --> 05:02.822
Don't know why he didn't try to use it.

05:04.960 --> 05:05.928
That's because,

05:05.928 --> 05:08.598
he wasn't going for help Alexx.

05:08.789 --> 05:11.156
He came down here

05:11.156 --> 05:13.432
to protect his daughter.

05:23.173 --> 05:24.712
Hey Laura.

05:25.293 --> 05:29.520
I think it's important for you to
be in a safe place right now.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.574
Safe? / Yeah

05:30.574 --> 05:32.550
they're probably gonna
broadcast on the news

05:32.550 --> 05:34.840
that you survived the attack.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.122
You mean he could come back?

05:36.122 --> 05:39.960
No, he wouldnt...
Laura, listen to me.

05:41.815 --> 05:43.522
Laura,

05:43.522 --> 05:45.868
I am gonna find this man.

05:45.868 --> 05:48.064
He is not gonna hurt you again,

05:48.064 --> 05:51.535
but I need you to be in
a safe place until I do.

05:51.879 --> 05:52.979
You understand?

05:53.418 --> 05:56.042
I want you to go with those officers

05:56.042 --> 05:57.640
until I find him.

05:57.640 --> 06:00.204
The next time you see my face,

06:00.406 --> 06:02.317
you're gonna know that you're safe.

06:04.417 --> 06:05.820
I promise.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.629
Okay?

06:10.139 --> 06:11.525
Okay.

06:11.902 --> 06:13.419
You go with these officers.

06:50.130 --> 06:51.440
Hey Cal.

06:51.988 --> 06:55.620
We narrowed the geographical
profile of our suspect.

06:55.620 --> 06:58.469
Huh, what did he do?
Hock up his address?

06:58.469 --> 07:00.680
Yeah. Take a look.

07:07.143 --> 07:08.127
What is it?

07:08.127 --> 07:11.455
Mercury, asbestos, and lead.

07:11.677 --> 07:15.678
Kerosene, distilled petroleum. It's jet fuel.

07:15.678 --> 07:16.581
Ground zero.

07:16.581 --> 07:18.015
There are thousands of cases of

07:18.015 --> 07:20.410
upper respiratory
inflamation reported by people

07:20.410 --> 07:23.270
who were living in the
vicinity of the 9/11 attack.

07:23.270 --> 07:25.802
So I'm thinking our suspect routinely

07:25.802 --> 07:29.002
expectorates phlegm in
order to clear his throat.

07:29.002 --> 07:32.118
Dad might have been in New York
on business during 9/11.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.374
Except I don't think the
Spellmans are the kind of people

07:34.374 --> 07:36.077
who would spit in the house.

07:36.077 --> 07:38.718
I'm gonna compare the
DNA to the parents but

07:38.718 --> 07:41.615
I'm thinking that the
spit belongs to our killer.

07:41.615 --> 07:43.781
They call Miami the sixth borough.

07:43.781 --> 07:45.385
The guy might have moved down here,

07:45.385 --> 07:46.470
be a local by now.

07:46.470 --> 07:48.391
I'll run it against local databases.

07:56.050 --> 07:58.566
Speed. They have dad's clothes,

07:58.566 --> 08:01.221
orange and purple fibers,
ancillary hairs,

08:01.221 --> 08:05.546
probably transferred by his attacker.

08:05.546 --> 08:07.645
That's strange cuz I found
seven different hairs

08:07.645 --> 08:08.881
and none of them were pulled.

08:08.881 --> 08:10.629
Okay, so the hairs were shed,

08:10.629 --> 08:13.207
and the fibers are from
a community source.

08:13.207 --> 08:14.143
You mean from a blanket?

08:14.143 --> 08:16.715
Just like from a blanket. What else?

08:16.715 --> 08:18.508
Found this. It's another piece.

08:18.508 --> 08:22.194
It's a coded piece of paper
with a partial shoe print.

08:22.194 --> 08:24.384
So, that icon on there,

08:24.626 --> 08:25.895
I ran it.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.384
You got Sunstar rental.

08:32.384 --> 08:33.759
Miami International.

08:33.759 --> 08:35.905
Calleigh has made a
connection to New York.

08:35.905 --> 08:40.164
Do you know what that means?
Our killer flew down here.

08:42.884 --> 08:44.656
Melandra. In the last 48 hours,

08:44.656 --> 08:47.478
how many males flew
down from New York City

08:47.478 --> 08:49.227
and rented a car?

08:49.227 --> 08:50.643
Close to a hundred.

08:50.643 --> 08:52.944
See I'm working with purple
and orange fibers,

08:52.944 --> 08:55.614
they could be from a seat, a blanket.

08:55.614 --> 08:57.867
I'm curious is there an airline

08:57.867 --> 09:00.177
that has that as a color sheme?

09:00.177 --> 09:01.275
Not many.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.075
But only one that services the East coast.

09:03.075 --> 09:05.471
- Maybach Air.
- In the last 48 hours,

09:05.471 --> 09:08.370
how many males have
flown down on Maybac?

09:08.616 --> 09:09.948
Two dozen.

09:09.948 --> 09:13.919
And returned their car late
last night, or early this morning.

09:14.701 --> 09:16.734
A Nick Murdock?

09:17.162 --> 09:19.530
I can get you a copy of his license.

09:19.530 --> 09:21.873
He returned a mid-size car at 5:30 AM

09:21.873 --> 09:23.998
returning to New York on Maybach air.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.267
Where would that car be?

09:25.267 --> 09:27.429
All the returns get detailed
at the end of the lot.

09:27.429 --> 09:28.565
Thank you.

09:29.203 --> 09:31.089
Wo, Wo gentlemen.

09:31.484 --> 09:33.783
Please step away from
the vehicle right now.

09:41.341 --> 09:43.848
Okay, what do we have here?

09:49.455 --> 09:52.059
Is that ridge detail right there?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.831
See what I can get off of it.

09:55.831 --> 09:57.086
Lieutenant.

09:57.086 --> 09:58.458
Yeah.

10:00.215 --> 10:01.353
His license.

10:02.373 --> 10:05.458
Here we go. Nick Murdock,
870 Worth Street,

10:05.458 --> 10:09.041
New York City, that's down
town where his spit put him.

10:09.855 --> 10:11.344
I gotta go Speed.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.051
Are you gonna go? / Yup!

10:13.051 --> 10:15.062
Murders happen here,

10:15.062 --> 10:16.925
but we have jurisdiction.

10:16.925 --> 10:19.282
If you call New York
homicide they'll pick him up.

10:19.282 --> 10:22.856
New York homicide didn't make
a promise to Laura Spellman.

10:57.784 --> 10:58.734
No surprising the world.

10:58.734 --> 11:01.153
See, our dead body's an undercover cop.

11:01.153 --> 11:02.782
Murdock, good guy.

11:03.753 --> 11:05.096
Newly wed.

11:06.025 --> 11:07.581
Just told his wife.

11:08.098 --> 11:09.526
No suspects.

11:09.830 --> 11:12.929
He was deep under cover,
dealing to about 30 street guys.

11:13.526 --> 11:16.399
We think one of his junkies got wise, wasted.

11:34.982 --> 11:36.576
Listen up everyone.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.284
I'd like to thank you all
for coming out here

11:39.284 --> 11:40.847
and showing your support.

11:40.847 --> 11:43.343
Obviously the situation is very secure.

11:43.343 --> 11:45.579
So do me a big favor

11:45.579 --> 11:48.454
and remove yourselves from
the crime scene. Thank you.

12:02.496 --> 12:04.200
No rush father.

12:04.999 --> 12:06.304
Temperature's ambient.

12:06.304 --> 12:08.098
He's been dead 24 plus.

12:08.098 --> 12:10.157
Smells like 72.

12:10.157 --> 12:11.874
I got a wallet for you.

12:11.874 --> 12:13.527
ID's missing.

12:39.060 --> 12:39.971
Can I help you?

12:39.971 --> 12:43.016
My name is Caine. Miami. CSI.

12:43.016 --> 12:46.279
I'm investigating a double murder case.

12:46.789 --> 12:48.276
Detective Mac Taylor,

12:48.276 --> 12:50.372
Crime scene unit first grade.

12:50.372 --> 12:51.694
I'm listening.

12:51.694 --> 12:55.452
Two nights ago in miami,
double murder case,

12:55.452 --> 12:57.961
married couple and I was...

12:58.531 --> 13:01.952
I was assuming that Murdock
here was my suspect.

13:02.312 --> 13:03.684
Narco Unit.

13:04.037 --> 13:06.427
Think he was killed
about three days ago.

13:06.427 --> 13:08.256
Strangled, probably a belt.

13:08.256 --> 13:10.864
So that could mean that
my suspect killed Murdock,

13:10.864 --> 13:14.726
took his identity went south,
did my murders.

13:14.726 --> 13:17.698
It could also mean that
we're chasing the same man.

13:17.698 --> 13:19.934
You think he's in New York?

13:20.264 --> 13:22.093
Well, one way or the other,

13:22.093 --> 13:24.431
everything's connected
brought you to me.

13:24.431 --> 13:27.337
Trail ends here.
I want first bite at prosecution.

13:27.337 --> 13:29.669
As you know,
Florida has the death penalty.

13:29.669 --> 13:30.790
So does New York.

13:30.790 --> 13:33.088
Yes, but you have not executed

13:33.088 --> 13:35.043
since '76.

13:35.887 --> 13:37.697
Politics.

13:37.697 --> 13:39.082
Mac,

13:39.577 --> 13:41.228
I have,

13:41.625 --> 13:43.667
a sixteen year old girl

13:43.667 --> 13:45.823
who is suddenly without both parents.

13:45.823 --> 13:48.387
I, have promised her.

13:48.387 --> 13:49.916
peace of mind.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.077
I got an officer's widow,

13:52.077 --> 13:53.741
who'd like some answers.

13:56.927 --> 13:58.317
We got a deal.

14:08.376 --> 14:11.960
Well, we know what our
suspect looks like now.

14:11.960 --> 14:15.368
Enough like Murdock to pass through
airport security.

14:16.535 --> 14:19.021
Murdock, answers the front door,

14:19.021 --> 14:22.327
guy follows him in here to do a by.

14:27.252 --> 14:28.908
Ready for us detective?

14:29.715 --> 14:32.226
One more minute and he's all yours.

14:33.503 --> 14:34.649
That's interesting.

14:34.649 --> 14:37.034
We scrape before we transport.

14:37.276 --> 14:39.235
We always vibe safe at the scene.

14:39.235 --> 14:40.347
Different process,

14:40.347 --> 14:42.029
same principle. / Ah, interesting.

14:42.029 --> 14:43.742
And you fume at the scene too.

14:43.742 --> 14:45.177
Did I hear somebody say fume?

14:45.177 --> 14:47.076
Cuz then I'm your man.

14:47.449 --> 14:49.908
Danny, I had you at that
Bodega in Queens.

14:49.908 --> 14:51.973
I know, I heard a cop went down.

14:51.973 --> 14:54.539
Figured you could use a guy like me.

14:55.163 --> 14:56.914
Stickin Hayden with the Bodega?

14:56.914 --> 14:59.004
Yeah, I got seniority over her.

14:59.407 --> 15:00.962
Who's this?

15:00.962 --> 15:02.286
He's one of us.

15:02.286 --> 15:04.250
From Miami Danny. / How are you?

15:04.250 --> 15:05.648
Lietenant Caine is helping us.

15:05.648 --> 15:07.024
Expecting to get some prints

15:07.024 --> 15:09.091
to confirm we're chasing the same guy.

15:09.091 --> 15:10.629
Say no more.

15:18.353 --> 15:21.117
Watch yourself.
You don't want this getting on ya.

15:21.117 --> 15:22.496
Cleaning bill's murder

15:29.069 --> 15:30.792
Looks like a partial whirl.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.495
Enough to start a search?

15:32.818 --> 15:34.081
Ah, we'll see.

15:42.596 --> 15:44.741
so what common reference
points do we have so far? / Morning.

15:44.741 --> 15:45.542
Morning.

15:45.542 --> 15:46.645
Danny, how are you making out?

15:46.645 --> 15:48.120
Good. Miami got a partial on the car door.

15:48.120 --> 15:51.562
We're working that 9/11 enhancement
software to pull it together.

15:52.895 --> 15:55.708
Okay. Thumb's right delta

15:55.708 --> 15:58.709
is on the first recurve
up above the divergent line.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.441
Let me give you a thumbs up.

16:01.301 --> 16:02.674
Very nice.

16:03.802 --> 16:06.028
Waiting for the whirl to stop.

16:06.879 --> 16:08.601
AFIS scan complete.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.502
Positive ID made.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.093
Thousand a week for life.

16:12.093 --> 16:15.930
David Penrod, aka
D.Penrod aka Dave Pem.

16:15.930 --> 16:18.731
Grand theft auto,
possession and trafficking.

16:18.731 --> 16:20.372
Last known address?

16:21.238 --> 16:23.348
489 East 112th street.

16:23.348 --> 16:24.607
Call homicide.

16:44.279 --> 16:46.490
Police! Open Up!

16:47.752 --> 16:48.718
Go.

16:51.102 --> 16:52.979
Runnin Mac. He's running.

16:55.397 --> 16:56.462
Up we go.

17:22.781 --> 17:24.096
Dave!

17:26.894 --> 17:28.512
Don't do it.

17:45.894 --> 17:47.833
Put out a broadcast.
Suspect at large.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.186
First precint sector charlie.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.222
Three-story drop.
He might have broken something.

19:06.886 --> 19:08.742
Hemotrace.

19:08.942 --> 19:10.714
Drains are the conscience of the city.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.093
Found blood? / Lots of it.

19:12.093 --> 19:14.154
Scary thing.
The blood on the fixture is wet.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.170
So it's fresh.

19:15.170 --> 19:17.813
Yeah, too fresh for your
Miami murders or my cops.

19:17.813 --> 19:19.338
I'll get this to the lab.
What did you get?

19:19.338 --> 19:22.871
Break in the case.
Our victims were at 720 Star Island,

19:22.871 --> 19:25.479
Penrod jotted down 702.

19:25.479 --> 19:27.519
- He hit the wrong house?
- He hit the wrong house.

19:27.519 --> 19:28.602
Who was with the right house?

19:28.602 --> 19:29.675
Let's find out.

19:32.386 --> 19:34.045
Duquesne. / Calleigh,

19:34.045 --> 19:38.974
I need a welfare check on 702
Star Island owner of record please.

19:41.591 --> 19:42.928
Reverse directory says

19:42.928 --> 19:45.302
OR of 702 Star

19:45.302 --> 19:49.171
Island is Michael Hanover Sr.

19:49.673 --> 19:52.126
Primary residence,

19:52.368 --> 19:55.339
15265th Avenue, New York City.

19:55.339 --> 19:59.579
Thank you.
Michael Hanover,15265th avenue.

20:07.542 --> 20:08.800
They aren't answering.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.263
They always answer.

20:20.141 --> 20:21.462
Hello?

20:22.537 --> 20:24.038
Police.

20:30.140 --> 20:31.703
Police.

20:46.677 --> 20:48.653
Is anybody here?

21:29.646 --> 21:32.240
Her throat is slit

21:32.240 --> 21:34.213
and there's the knife.

21:37.993 --> 21:39.357
She had a habit.

21:39.357 --> 21:41.538
That explains why she didn't fight back.

21:41.538 --> 21:42.792
Where's the husband?

21:42.792 --> 21:44.761
Where's the study?

21:51.818 --> 21:55.959
Now this, seems strangely familiar.

21:56.507 --> 21:58.974
Knife's in mom, dad bought it first.

21:58.974 --> 22:00.273
Mr. Penrod got this family's

22:00.273 --> 22:03.125
sleeping arrangements down, didn't he?

22:05.854 --> 22:07.642
Did you hear that?

22:08.879 --> 22:10.464
Where's that came from?

22:10.464 --> 22:12.107
Back room

22:18.276 --> 22:19.316
Son?

22:19.316 --> 22:21.079
He's still breathing!

22:21.079 --> 22:22.267
Stay with us.

22:22.267 --> 22:25.242
- CSI 2433 to central okay?
- Central go ahead.

22:25.242 --> 22:29.340
I need a bus forth with at 1526
5th Avenue, Hanover residence.

22:29.340 --> 22:31.647
I have a male stabbed,
put a rush on it, okay?

22:31.647 --> 22:33.068
Stay with us.

22:48.763 --> 22:50.551
Okay guys, hold up, hold up.

22:50.551 --> 22:52.347
Just need a couple shots
to the entry wounds.

22:52.347 --> 22:54.885
Life saving measures over
evidence Bonaserah.

22:54.885 --> 22:57.817
Look, what I'm doing may prevent
another attempt on his life, okay?

22:57.817 --> 22:59.875
- Hang in there, buddy.
- Detective Taylor.

22:59.875 --> 23:01.245
Detective Taylor.

23:01.526 --> 23:03.974
Is this like the dumbo massacre?

23:04.163 --> 23:06.830
What about Penrod?
Is he still at large?

23:06.830 --> 23:09.234
Davi Penrod, how did she get that?

23:09.547 --> 23:11.810
New York. You'd think that it's news.

23:11.810 --> 23:13.785
Ticking clock's begotten.
You ready for this?

23:13.785 --> 23:15.646
Oh yeah. Where's your friend?

23:21.778 --> 23:23.669
Blond.

23:24.589 --> 23:26.150
What color is the wife's hair?

23:27.098 --> 23:28.497
Brunette.

23:28.770 --> 23:30.918
Maybe dad had a visitor.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.334
Bob Fosse's life story.

23:43.717 --> 23:45.174
All that jazz.

23:45.174 --> 23:47.861
Semen. / All man with a stud.

23:47.861 --> 23:51.045
So, mom's in the bedroom,

23:51.045 --> 23:53.434
knocked on on Percacette.

23:54.221 --> 23:58.340
Yep, and dad's in the
study with a candle stick.

23:58.757 --> 24:00.771
Only one way to put out his fire.

24:00.771 --> 24:02.322
Blow.

24:07.693 --> 24:09.137
You think the bimbo's connected?

24:09.137 --> 24:11.370
Yeah in Venezi-ano's
theory of quantum physics,

24:11.370 --> 24:14.412
everything's connected.
Just have to find out how.

24:14.412 --> 24:16.534
Have DNA look for tag.

24:16.797 --> 24:18.771
When was the last time
you saw Hanovers?

24:19.235 --> 24:22.112
When I unloaded the limo
yesterday afternoon.

24:22.112 --> 24:24.357
They came back from Florida,
the next thing I know,

24:24.357 --> 24:26.309
police is swarming the building.

24:26.309 --> 24:28.222
Okay, fire code says
there's a back door here.

24:28.222 --> 24:29.632
I can't seem to find it.

24:29.632 --> 24:31.343
Oh, yeah, it's hidden.

24:32.532 --> 24:34.616
Why don't you try unhiding it.

24:35.419 --> 24:36.330
Thanks.

24:49.158 --> 24:50.332
You need a key?

24:50.332 --> 24:52.285
Yes. / You got one?

24:52.285 --> 24:54.515
Yes, and the Hanovers have three.

24:54.515 --> 24:55.551
I'm gonna need yours.

24:55.551 --> 24:58.417
I already gave mine to
the homicide detective.

24:58.417 --> 24:59.535
Should I go ask him...?

24:59.535 --> 25:01.317
No, that's alright, I'll take care of it.

25:03.295 --> 25:04.928
Did you see anybody
go out here last night?

25:04.928 --> 25:06.921
No, I have to stay in front of the building.

25:06.921 --> 25:10.564
God forbid a tenant should
have to open their own door.

25:10.564 --> 25:12.370
That's good enough, thanks.

25:13.281 --> 25:15.332
Hey, I've got a blood swipe.

25:15.332 --> 25:17.891
Looks like the killer's exit.
Maybe entrance too.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.310
I'll process the door and stairs.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.972
Look for anything that isn't
from Hanover or Penrod.

25:26.085 --> 25:27.714
No forced entry.

25:27.714 --> 25:30.879
Pop the lock. Take it apart.
See if it was picked.

25:31.108 --> 25:32.210
Follow up on the keys,

25:32.210 --> 25:33.709
somebody got in here somehow.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.585
How's our secret door?
Was it picked?

25:57.585 --> 25:59.091
No scratches inside the lock,

25:59.091 --> 26:01.665
all markings are consistent
with key use only.

26:06.074 --> 26:07.612
You know, if there are nine
rats for every person

26:07.612 --> 26:10.676
living in Manhatten, there's gotta
be at least five keys per head.

26:10.676 --> 26:12.146
Apartment door, car door...

26:12.146 --> 26:14.883
Lock at the gym.
Yeah. Fast Forward.

26:14.883 --> 26:17.830
But there are only a few
alloys used to make keys.

26:17.830 --> 26:21.110
New duplicate keys are all
coated in red acrylic now.

26:21.110 --> 26:23.157
And that's what these shavings are.

26:23.157 --> 26:25.164
A duplicate was used to get in here,

26:27.126 --> 26:29.245
and shavings were left behind.

26:29.245 --> 26:31.358
Right, so it was the last one in.

26:31.358 --> 26:33.074
Any other disturbances?

26:33.074 --> 26:34.584
Pristine.

26:35.110 --> 26:37.664
Penrod didn't just have help,
it was an inside job.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.400
How do you figure?

26:39.400 --> 26:41.594
Well you've got four masters, right?

26:41.594 --> 26:43.776
Somebody's gotta be really close to
the Hanovers and the doorman

26:43.776 --> 26:45.292
to get one and get it duped.

26:45.292 --> 26:46.930
And I need those masters.

26:54.717 --> 26:55.829
Doctor Hawkes.

26:56.495 --> 26:58.511
So glad I could get an appointment.

26:58.511 --> 27:00.900
Mayor's office called,
put in a word for you.

27:00.900 --> 27:02.149
Figures.

27:02.451 --> 27:03.616
What's TOD?

27:03.616 --> 27:06.607
The victims have been dead
since about four this morning.

27:07.101 --> 27:10.818
New York, Miami stab
wounds are similar

27:10.818 --> 27:13.645
in both manner and location.

27:13.645 --> 27:16.396
However, one of the Miami
victims was nearly decapitated.

27:16.396 --> 27:18.687
Killer showed more restraint
with the Hanovers.

27:18.687 --> 27:21.085
We're aware of that. Anything else?

27:21.085 --> 27:24.110
Turns out Mike Hanover
has a heart after all.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.175
Well, he did.

27:26.175 --> 27:27.254
A strong one.

27:27.254 --> 27:28.450
Withstood a massive
myocardial infarction.

27:28.450 --> 27:30.860
Scar tissue indicates it
happened within the last year

27:30.860 --> 27:33.012
But his heart disease was progressive.

27:33.012 --> 27:35.255
I'm not sure how many
more years he had.

27:35.512 --> 27:37.018
Anything else?

27:37.018 --> 27:38.763
His crotch.

27:54.022 --> 27:56.341
I have heard of having the blues,

27:56.341 --> 27:58.622
but this is ridiculous.

28:32.408 --> 28:34.193
Aiden / Hey.

28:34.193 --> 28:36.783
Thanks for letting me work trace on this.

28:37.261 --> 28:38.552
Do a bodega for Danny,

28:38.552 --> 28:40.935
should be able to touch a big case like this.

28:40.935 --> 28:43.790
Figured out what had Mr. Hanover so blue?

28:48.799 --> 28:53.199
Propylene glycol dicocoate,
alcohol benzoate, ozokerite

28:53.199 --> 28:56.710
High concentration of
titanium dioxide, iron dioxide.

28:56.710 --> 28:58.489
Cosmetic make up.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.033
High pigment?

29:00.033 --> 29:02.107
Practically opaque.

29:02.107 --> 29:04.012
Stage make up.

29:04.012 --> 29:04.980
Mm-hmm

29:05.415 --> 29:08.976
So whoever hit her knees,
was probably in a play.

29:15.896 --> 29:19.414
Homicide says that this is the only
show that isn't dark on Mondays,

29:19.414 --> 29:21.734
you're the only one of the cast of Rainbow

29:21.734 --> 29:23.334
that wears the blue make up.

29:23.334 --> 29:25.634
And your artistic director tells us
that you were in a relationship

29:25.634 --> 29:28.013
with Michael Hanover Senior?

29:28.682 --> 29:29.963
Am I under arrest?

29:29.963 --> 29:31.434
Depends on what you tell us.

29:31.434 --> 29:33.590
Look, all I know is what I hear on the news.

29:33.590 --> 29:36.261
Maybe we can help you know more.

29:37.037 --> 29:38.958
See this hair?

29:39.273 --> 29:42.807
This was taken from the chair that
Mike Handover was killed in.

29:43.097 --> 29:46.519
We take a DNA sample,
will it match your hair?

29:47.026 --> 29:49.230
What do you want me to say, "I was there"?

29:49.603 --> 29:50.518
I was there.

29:50.518 --> 29:52.504
Oh, we know where you were.

29:52.504 --> 29:55.071
Your make up put you south of his border.

29:55.071 --> 29:57.699
Oh, that...

29:59.175 --> 30:03.230
I was trying to wind things down with Mike.

30:03.405 --> 30:07.836
That was just a parting gift.

30:09.098 --> 30:12.426
I cabbed after the show used
his key to the back door.

30:12.426 --> 30:13.915
I did my thing,

30:13.915 --> 30:16.213
gave him the time of his life.

30:16.213 --> 30:18.844
I left around... 3 o'clock?

30:25.137 --> 30:28.667
Maybe you let Davi Penrod in the
secret door way on your way out.

30:28.667 --> 30:30.716
Who's Davi Penrod?

30:31.701 --> 30:36.369
Look, Mike told me there'd
be other shows down the line,

30:36.369 --> 30:38.584
said he'd even back a play I wrote.

30:38.876 --> 30:41.480
Why would I have any part in killing him?

30:41.931 --> 30:43.506
We don't know.

30:43.890 --> 30:45.964
We'd like the key you used last night.

30:45.964 --> 30:47.785
And the clothes you wore.

30:56.704 --> 30:58.205
No blood.

30:58.848 --> 31:00.646
Nothing's absorbing.

31:01.128 --> 31:02.457
Yet.

31:05.277 --> 31:06.662
Where's lieutenant Caine?

31:06.662 --> 31:08.615
He's with homicide. He got a call.

31:08.615 --> 31:11.470
Someone spotted Penrod
in a clinic in Tribeca,

31:11.470 --> 31:13.453
trying to get his leg set.

31:16.290 --> 31:19.079
Okay, I've got biological fluid.

31:22.486 --> 31:24.383
And it ain't blood.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.042
No luck with Penrod?

31:30.042 --> 31:31.591
No, he realized that the nurse made him

31:31.591 --> 31:34.915
so he bolted before we arrived.
What did you get?

31:34.915 --> 31:37.397
Processed the dancer's clothes

31:37.980 --> 31:40.662
Semen's not a match to Michael Hanover.

31:40.662 --> 31:43.970
But the allels are matched
to each of the thirteen loci.

31:43.970 --> 31:48.542
Which means Renee slept
with another male Hanover

31:49.502 --> 31:51.067
And there's only one of those.

31:51.067 --> 31:53.330
And he's right in there.

31:53.330 --> 31:56.401
She's reason enough, the guy
would want dad out of the way.

31:56.401 --> 31:59.564
And that is motive in any state.

32:07.418 --> 32:10.092
Did your father know you were
sleeping with his mistress?

32:10.092 --> 32:12.228
She's not his mistress.

32:12.566 --> 32:14.147
She's my girlfriend.

32:14.147 --> 32:16.030
Is that why you killed your dad?

32:16.920 --> 32:19.084
'Cause you caught them together?

32:19.084 --> 32:22.104
Are you aware last night
they shared an act

32:22.104 --> 32:24.690
of an intimiate nature.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.967
I knew.

32:27.180 --> 32:28.461
Look, he didn't care about Renee,

32:28.461 --> 32:31.702
he was always lying to her
about helping her career.

32:33.050 --> 32:35.509
I care about her. / Michael,

32:35.509 --> 32:38.158
how did somebody like you end
up with your dad's mistress?

32:38.158 --> 32:40.435
how does that switch take place?

32:40.435 --> 32:42.739
I saw her crying,

32:43.136 --> 32:46.428
for the twentieth time
about how he treated her.

32:46.853 --> 32:48.484
I was a shoulder for her.

32:48.484 --> 32:50.128
See, my old man,

32:50.128 --> 32:52.570
he promises a lot of things,

32:52.570 --> 32:53.963
but not me.

32:55.758 --> 32:58.932
How long were you sneaking
around your dad's back?

32:58.932 --> 33:00.439
A couple of months.

33:00.439 --> 33:02.780
We were trying to come
up with a way to tell him.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.510
Sure you didn't tell him last night?

33:04.510 --> 33:05.955
No.

33:06.705 --> 33:08.799
Look I didn't kill my dad.

33:08.799 --> 33:11.519
We want the keys to the back door.

33:19.226 --> 33:20.060
Hello, what are you doing here?

33:20.060 --> 33:21.684
You know you can't talk to him.

33:21.684 --> 33:23.085
Both of you, out!

33:23.085 --> 33:24.890
My client suffered a terrible loss.

33:24.890 --> 33:27.434
And about to inherit half of
Manhattan I understand.

33:27.434 --> 33:30.079
Michael, as it turns out
is the prime beneficiary

33:30.079 --> 33:31.804
of his father's estate. Correct?

33:31.804 --> 33:33.129
Homicide tells me that they're trying

33:33.129 --> 33:34.817
to get hold of the old mans' will.

33:34.817 --> 33:37.536
It's not possible.
I filed a motion for protective order.

33:37.536 --> 33:41.176
And how about you show
us junior's stab wounds.

33:41.176 --> 33:42.173
Why?

33:42.173 --> 33:44.957
To see if you or your
girlfriend cut you for show.

33:44.957 --> 33:47.334
Excuse me, my client is a victim,

33:47.334 --> 33:49.159
and is to be treated as such.

33:49.159 --> 33:51.596
Then you wouldn't mind
letting us see the injury.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.954
He wouldn't, I would.

33:53.954 --> 33:56.201
There's the door.

34:01.777 --> 34:03.861
Other ways to check his wounds.

34:03.861 --> 34:05.684
I'll be at the morgue.

34:05.684 --> 34:07.663
I'll be on Bonasera's photos. / Good.

34:08.248 --> 34:09.967
So did you get a hit on the master keys?

34:09.967 --> 34:10.810
Got all four right here.

34:10.810 --> 34:13.228
Mom, dad, junior, and the door man.

34:13.228 --> 34:15.734
Found machine marks on one
of them, it was definitely copied.

34:18.541 --> 34:19.710
Let me guess, the door man.

34:19.710 --> 34:23.143
Sorry, the number four the
key belonging to Mrs. Hanover.

34:23.143 --> 34:24.241
What?

34:24.241 --> 34:25.516
Evans Gretchen found it in her bag,

34:25.516 --> 34:27.196
in her room. Look.

34:27.396 --> 34:28.728
Scratches are from the dupe machine.

34:28.728 --> 34:30.953
Someone made of a copy of this key.

34:31.516 --> 34:32.701
The dupe was definately used to get in

34:32.701 --> 34:34.833
the back door the night of the murders.

34:34.991 --> 34:36.116
I don't get it.

34:36.116 --> 34:39.869
How does a monster like Penrod
get involved with Mrs. Hanover?

34:42.225 --> 34:44.516
Okay, that's mom
let me see dad please.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.487
What are we looking for?

34:45.487 --> 34:48.606
We are looking for hilt mark bruising.

35:03.372 --> 35:06.052
we've got bruising on dad.

35:06.778 --> 35:09.521
But none on Michael junior.

35:21.357 --> 35:22.481
Horatio Caine.

35:22.481 --> 35:24.651
You're seeing what
I'm seeing? / Uh-huh.

35:24.651 --> 35:28.751
Hilt marks on the parents,
no hilt marks on the son.

35:30.141 --> 35:32.386
Junior was stabbed with a different knife.

35:32.386 --> 35:34.427
Two knives and two attackers, uh?

35:34.427 --> 35:35.957
And we've only got one knife.

35:35.957 --> 35:38.484
I'm gonna go back to Tribeca
and look for Penrod, okay?

35:38.484 --> 35:39.872
You keep me posted,
okay? Thank you.

35:43.613 --> 35:46.474
I think there's another knife
at the Hanover residence.

35:46.474 --> 35:50.164
No. I'm telling you Mac,
we took the place apart.

37:40.943 --> 37:43.359
Found this in the elevator shaft.

37:44.464 --> 37:46.018
There's no hilt,

37:46.018 --> 37:48.959
which means it doesn't leave a mark.

37:48.959 --> 37:51.379
Anybody could have stabbed him.

37:51.512 --> 37:54.194
When our lab tests the
blood on your uniform,

37:54.194 --> 37:57.451
and it matches Michael junior's that anyone

37:57.604 --> 37:59.121
becomes you.

37:59.977 --> 38:02.474
Specificity of DNA.

38:02.975 --> 38:04.593
You got back on the elevator,

38:04.593 --> 38:07.019
and dropped this down the shaft.

38:07.983 --> 38:10.766
Unfortunately for you,

38:11.421 --> 38:13.985
you dropped something else.

38:18.031 --> 38:21.250
Do you mind holding
up your arms please?

38:28.815 --> 38:30.424
Missing tassel.

38:32.050 --> 38:34.679
I imagine when you
were wiping the blood off,

38:34.679 --> 38:37.210
the tassel was severed.

38:40.794 --> 38:43.021
You're the only door man in Michael

38:43.021 --> 38:47.083
Hanover senior's last will and testament.

38:47.366 --> 38:49.640
Lawyers released it after we picked you up.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.964
There's interesting thing here on page 51.

38:53.558 --> 38:56.348
For saving my life by
administering emergency CPR

38:56.348 --> 38:58.048
when I sustained a heart attack,

38:58.048 --> 39:01.146
keeping me alive until
the paramedics arrived.

39:01.146 --> 39:03.819
I leave the sum of one million dollars

39:03.819 --> 39:05.297
to Kevin Dowell

39:05.297 --> 39:08.116
Payable in full, upon my death.

39:08.116 --> 39:11.185
A million Kevin, you're in my will.

39:11.596 --> 39:14.149
Only, you got impatient,

39:14.149 --> 39:16.527
tried to speed up the process.

39:16.918 --> 39:19.979
So you had Hanover killed.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.293
That brings us to Penrod.

39:23.872 --> 39:25.057
A monster like him,

39:25.057 --> 39:29.004
what's his connection to
a hardworking guy like you?

39:30.629 --> 39:33.232
Every good door man needs a dealer.

39:33.232 --> 39:35.690
He's been mine for ten years.

39:35.690 --> 39:37.903
Drugs, women,

39:38.379 --> 39:41.214
every kind of kink, you name it.

39:47.136 --> 39:50.137
Gotta keep the tenants happy.

39:51.945 --> 39:54.790
There's nothing Penrod won't do.

39:54.790 --> 39:56.813
For a price.

40:02.333 --> 40:04.834
I don't know what you're talking about.

40:05.457 --> 40:08.131
I'm talking about murder

40:09.295 --> 40:11.884
and conspiracy

40:11.884 --> 40:13.840
to commit murder.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.480
No, I told you.
Half million and I'm in.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.174
now gimme the address.

40:19.331 --> 40:23.350
7-0-2, Star Island.

40:23.350 --> 40:25.237
Now, I got an idea, don't worry.

40:25.237 --> 40:27.670
Got a low life nobody will miss.

40:27.986 --> 40:29.875
That low life

40:29.875 --> 40:32.970
was an undercover
New York City police officer.

40:32.970 --> 40:36.140
You coulnd't have drawn more
attention if you'd sent up a flare.

40:36.140 --> 40:38.274
You flew down to Miami,

40:38.274 --> 40:40.624
and you killed the wrong family.

40:42.337 --> 40:45.654
is not 720. You're dyslexic, aren't you?

40:45.654 --> 40:46.887
Bet you had a heart attack

40:46.887 --> 40:50.314
when Hanovers drove
up back in Mahattan.

40:53.486 --> 40:54.847
Mrs. Hanover, you're back.

40:54.847 --> 40:57.373
Take the bags up the back stair please.

40:57.621 --> 40:59.665
Hello Dowell. / Hello Mr. Hanover.

41:00.669 --> 41:02.640
The doorman

41:02.843 --> 41:06.030
was smart enough not to
dupe you one of his own keys.

41:06.030 --> 41:08.734
You went up to the Hanovers
and started killing them.

41:08.734 --> 41:10.703
You were a little more relaxed this time.

41:10.703 --> 41:13.242
But you couldn't stay out front, could you?

41:14.932 --> 41:16.547
I'll take care of the kid.

41:21.107 --> 41:24.265
You needed junior to stay alive,

41:24.265 --> 41:28.230
to throw suspicion off yourself.

41:28.230 --> 41:29.841
And it worked.

41:30.509 --> 41:35.088
Till the evidence told us different story.

42:03.790 --> 42:05.577
Detective Taylor?

42:08.047 --> 42:09.228
Detective?

42:09.615 --> 42:11.123
Detective Taylor?

42:12.110 --> 42:13.431
Detective Taylor?

42:14.526 --> 42:15.704
Detective Taylor?

42:17.920 --> 42:19.136
Detective?

42:19.136 --> 42:20.864
Detective Taylor?

42:21.157 --> 42:22.678
Detective? Is there any one thing

42:22.678 --> 42:24.075
that helped you to break this case?

42:24.075 --> 42:27.085
I just want to say one
word to my colleague.

42:42.298 --> 42:44.116
Hey / Hey.

42:44.601 --> 42:47.152
Recognize those getaway sticks.

42:50.060 --> 42:51.873
Renee.

42:51.873 --> 42:56.208
Junior inherits half a billion
and his dad's mistress.

42:56.208 --> 43:00.042
Yeah, it's the stuff New York
legends are made of.

43:58.321 --> 44:00.269
"Thank you"
