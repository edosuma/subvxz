00:06.080 --> 00:08.560
PREVIOUSLY ON MYTHOMANIAC

00:09.760 --> 00:12.880
Dad? Maybe it's time you showered.

00:14.200 --> 00:17.080
Hi! What a lovely family dinner.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.320
Too bad Mom's not here.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.920
Don't mention her at dinner.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.680
You've been locked up here for weeks.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.240
You can't spy on them forever.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.400
I'm watching them live.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.280
<i>We go to the same school.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:30.120
Renan's in prep school
and he's writing a novel.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.080
<i>A letter, for you.</i>

00:33.160 --> 00:34.640
That's Elvira's handwriting.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.280
"I'd like for us
to spend Christmas together."

00:37.360 --> 00:38.400
"A fresh start."

00:38.480 --> 00:39.760
I can't.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.520
<i>Aren't you glad to see me?</i>

00:43.600 --> 00:45.360
Sure. Are you eating with us tonight?

00:46.040 --> 00:47.160
Will your mom be there?

00:47.760 --> 00:48.800
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-Where is she?</i>

00:48.880 --> 00:49.960
<i>No idea.</i>

00:51.040 --> 00:53.240
I need money. Hire me back.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.960
You were fired for misconduct.

00:55.560 --> 00:56.840
<i>Hi, Isa.</i>

00:56.920 --> 00:58.280
I have nowhere to sleep.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.360
I can help out.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.560
-I have a sofa bed.
-Mr. Brunet?

01:06.120 --> 01:08.640
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:29.200 --> 01:30.880
-Good morning.
-Morning.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.600
Some tea?

01:42.920 --> 01:43.760
Thanks.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.240
Did you sleep well?

01:48.240 --> 01:49.080
No.

01:50.760 --> 01:51.600
Orange juice.

02:30.960 --> 02:31.800
Hi.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.640
Someone needs to go grocery shopping.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.560
Hi!

02:47.160 --> 02:49.520
Smells like something died in there.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.360
We're out of cereal.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.080
<i>You look a little down.</i>

02:58.760 --> 02:59.640
Some bread?

03:00.800 --> 03:01.640
No, thanks.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.600
At GPMA, you were always in a foul mood.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.320
But you're actually very joyful.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.240
I guess I wasn't made
for a high-responsibility job.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.440
And I don't drink anymore.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.040
Insurers are so misunderstood.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.240
No one likes us.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.480
You don't care at all, do you?

03:27.560 --> 03:28.680
Of course I do.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.960
But Christmas is in three days
and Patrick hasn't called

03:33.480 --> 03:35.400
to give me his answer.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.480
Christmas.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.720
It's so dull.
I'd rather jump out a window.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.280
We should go to the theater.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.000
Civilized people do that.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.640
I don't care about Christmas.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.320
The point is we'd be together again.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.840
Maybe travel somewhere together.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.120
Traveling is over, Elvira.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.720
People go places,
but they don't travel anymore.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.240
Your Patrick's already moved on.

04:03.960 --> 04:05.200
Schnitzler said,

04:05.280 --> 04:08.800
"It's easier to catch a bird in flight

04:08.880 --> 04:10.800
than love slipping away."

04:11.480 --> 04:12.680
Fuck Schnitzler.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.480
-Is it him?
-No.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.880
But maybe good news.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.320
Gotta go.

04:20.960 --> 04:21.800
Hang on.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.920
-I bought you some clothes.
-But…

04:36.160 --> 04:37.160
Thank you.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.080
We need to buy groceries.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.480
When will the twins be back?

04:45.200 --> 04:47.560
Don't know. I think
they've hooked up with some guys.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.760
We could go to the supermarket.
I'm free this morning.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.080
What's that doing here?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.960
Found one biscuit. Carole?

05:01.200 --> 05:02.400
That's mine.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.360
So now you're hiding food?

05:06.440 --> 05:09.320
I need a snack after swimming.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.960
-It's the holidays.
-What?

05:11.520 --> 05:12.840
It's the holidays.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.440
School ends tonight, Dad.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.600
What parent doesn't know that?

05:17.520 --> 05:20.520
Some of my friends are going skiing.
But us, nothing.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.280
It's gonna be the worst Christmas--

05:24.040 --> 05:24.880
Ever.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.040
Dad?

05:32.680 --> 05:33.520
Dad?

05:38.480 --> 05:39.800
I'm awake now.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.760
Sam, let's go shopping.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.440
I promise you a great Christmas.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.120
Here.

06:16.040 --> 06:16.880
All right.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.320
Maybe put some shoes on.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.280
Take it easy, okay?

06:24.480 --> 06:26.680
I'm not quite ready for shoes yet.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.160
It's amazing.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.080
We can see the baby so clearly.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.040
He looks like my mother.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.760
I know it sounds weird, but it's true.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.680
The baby's a bit small.
But everything's fine.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.440
Just try and gain some weight.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.800
You're starting month seven,
you can afford it.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.000
It's not been seven months.

06:59.240 --> 07:02.200
She's talking weeks of amenorrhea.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.000
Not actual months. I'll explain.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.600
You can get dressed.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.080
Everything's fine.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.840
That heartbeat…

07:18.920 --> 07:20.240
It's something.

07:44.000 --> 07:44.840
Channa.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.680
I love your new style.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.960
This?

07:52.000 --> 07:52.840
Never mind.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.960
So? What do you have for me?

07:58.680 --> 08:01.120
We have a huge problem.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.080
The aluminum factory, our biggest client.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.080
They want to ditch us.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.280
We've spent months negotiating.
The lease is up in a couple of weeks.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.200
If we lose them,
our office will be shut down.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.000
Like we needed that.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.400
If you get them to renew their contract,

08:16.480 --> 08:20.120
it'll give me more ammo to argue
your case with the higher-ups.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.480
What can I do?

08:22.560 --> 08:24.560
-You had good rapport with the manager.
-Yes.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.640
Yes. Mr. Fongarnant.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.240
He's always worked with aluminum.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.800
One divorce, two marriages, three kids.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.360
Well done, Elvira. You're good.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.720
I used to write all this stuff down
in a little book.

08:38.800 --> 08:41.320
Kid names and ages, hobbies.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.320
Where's that book?

08:42.920 --> 08:43.800
At home.

08:44.640 --> 08:45.680
I'll get it back.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.720
I'll be able to buy Christmas presents.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.320
I'm sick of Christmas already.
If Santa was real, I say lock him up.

08:53.840 --> 08:57.080
The law's pretty clear about that.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.280
Entering homes without consent

08:59.360 --> 09:01.920
is punishable by jail or heavy fines.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.520
Little bit of insurer humor there.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.240
I'm counting on you.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.040
-What do you want?
-To speak to Elvira.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.920
-She's not here.
-I know you're hiding her.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.280
She's gone.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.240
I don't know where.

09:48.880 --> 09:49.960
<i>Don't panic!</i>

09:50.040 --> 09:53.160
Nothing special planned
for Christmas Eve dinner?

09:54.720 --> 09:56.320
Dare to be different!

09:57.000 --> 09:59.480
Why not try a recipe

09:59.560 --> 10:02.760
with duck foie gras and pineapple?

10:03.520 --> 10:07.120
With a nice bottle of champagne,
of course.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.520
Let Christmas surprise you!

10:09.600 --> 10:14.920
-Do you need me to push the cart?
-No. I need it for support.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.360
We need cleaning products.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.040
No, that aisle gives me anxiety.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.760
Let's start with what's on sale.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.520
Dad?

10:33.680 --> 10:34.840
It's the other way.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.080
Okay.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.840
Don't miss our foie gras special.
Buy two cans,

10:41.920 --> 10:46.040
and get one free box
of delicious chocolates.

10:58.640 --> 10:59.720
How's the fit?

11:00.280 --> 11:01.120
Good.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.960
-I'll soon be able to pay you back.
-No rush.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.080
Thanks. See you tonight.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.200
See you.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.960
Hello. Fidelity card?

11:21.920 --> 11:24.360
-See ya.
-Don't you have PE?

11:25.640 --> 11:26.800
I have stuff to do.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.440
"Lorenzo!"

11:31.120 --> 11:33.160
-He's my cousin.
-So what?

11:33.240 --> 11:34.960
I've kissed most of mine.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.080
Including Marie-Joelle.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.760
Yeah, but you were eight.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.280
As long as you don't have sex with him,
it's fine.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.360
Shut up.

11:51.880 --> 11:52.720
Thanks.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.600
I'm skipping PE too.

11:58.320 --> 11:59.320
It's overrated.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.480
Do you need a ride home?

12:04.560 --> 12:05.840
My cousin's got a car.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.680
My mom's picking me up.

12:08.960 --> 12:09.800
All right.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.240
People who pay attention to themselves
also pay attention to others.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.640
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

12:19.720 --> 12:22.400
I like what you're wearing. It suits you.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.320
Thanks.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.160
-Hi.
-Hi.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.280
No driver's ed today?

12:54.920 --> 12:56.360
<i>It's on sale!</i>

12:56.440 --> 12:59.520
<i>Swim in an ocean of flavors!</i>

13:00.320 --> 13:02.760
<i>Go for the fish and impress your guests.</i>

13:03.800 --> 13:06.480
<i>Try something new this Christmas.</i>

13:06.560 --> 13:09.760
<i>Invite John Dory to your table.</i>

13:12.320 --> 13:14.200
-You okay?
-Sure.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.120
Fish is full of mercury anyway.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.480
I've never trusted fish, you know?

13:22.560 --> 13:24.040
Nothing that's from the sea.

13:24.920 --> 13:25.760
Jesus Christ.

13:27.920 --> 13:28.760
The sea.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.040
Fuck.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.200
Dad, look at me. Hold onto me.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.680
Hold on.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.880
Yeah. Breathe in.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.400
One more time.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.640
-I'm fine.
-You sure?

13:59.680 --> 14:00.880
It's over.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.080
Hand over the list.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.840
Let's go.

14:06.960 --> 14:07.800
Fuck me.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.480
-What?
-It's what Carole added.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.320
Right.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.240
<i>Buy yourself a present</i>
<i>and please everyone.</i>

14:32.200 --> 14:35.760
<i>This Christmas,</i>
<i>go for some hot new lingerie.</i>

14:35.840 --> 14:36.880
<i>Happy Christmas,</i>

14:36.960 --> 14:38.760
<i>lover boys and lover girls!</i>

14:39.240 --> 14:40.760
<i>Buy one matching set</i>

14:40.840 --> 14:43.320
<i>and get one makeup kit for free.</i>

14:44.040 --> 14:45.640
Excuse us?

14:48.720 --> 14:50.960
Could you point us in the right direction?

14:51.480 --> 14:52.720
It depends.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.440
Here, the ones for light flow.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.360
Here, medium flow.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.640
There, heavy flow. Don't get

15:02.720 --> 15:05.040
the scented ones.
Periods don't actually stink.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.280
It's a myth created to shame women.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.600
But those fucking industrial scents,

15:10.680 --> 15:12.360
now they stink like hell.

15:12.960 --> 15:17.080
The nighttime range is more absorbent.
And of course, tampons.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.240
A friendly warning.

15:18.920 --> 15:22.760
You can't lose your virginity to a tampon.
That's bullshit.

15:22.840 --> 15:27.320
The hymen's actually not
a flimsy little thing. Let's be serious.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.360
And the clitoris is actually
over four inches long.

15:30.440 --> 15:31.280
That's right.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.760
The little bean you can see
is the tip of the iceberg.

15:35.680 --> 15:36.560
Have a nice day.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.280
Have a nice day.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.120
That's weird.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.360
I grew up here.

15:58.560 --> 16:02.680
I used to play here
when Dad was working on Wednesdays.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.360
Why is he selling the store?

16:08.120 --> 16:09.200
We're broke.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.320
It was a failure anyway.

16:11.920 --> 16:15.640
People have phones now.
Photography's pretty much dead.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.920
Do you know what he used to do?

16:22.080 --> 16:22.920
He sold discs.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.240
Look.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.560
I collect tattoo photos.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.760
I'll make a collage,

16:32.840 --> 16:36.480
and it'll look like someone's back.
Like a puzzle. It's for Sam.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.200
He'll love it.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.040
And here, look.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.000
My mother's back.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.760
She had the name
of her first boyfriend tattooed.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.320
My dad's so jealous.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.480
Come on.

16:57.480 --> 16:58.640
Let me show you.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.360
Ta-da.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.720
My dad taught me how to develop pictures.

17:19.120 --> 17:20.040
The old way.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.200
What's up?

17:32.680 --> 17:33.520
Nothing.

17:40.960 --> 17:41.920
You're being weird.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.400
Look, I…

17:49.400 --> 17:51.200
I don't like small spaces.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.000
Got it.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.000
-We have to go anyway.
-Right.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.880
-My mock <i>bac</i> is today.
-Let's go.

18:44.600 --> 18:48.360
<i>This is Patrick, leave a message.</i>

18:48.440 --> 18:50.600
Hi Patrick, it's Sandrine.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.480
Leaving you one more voicemail.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.000
I guess you're busy.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.880
Call me. Bye.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.840
Who is it?

19:13.440 --> 19:15.880
Sandrine. I can't handle her.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.320
Do you have the fidelity card?

19:17.400 --> 19:20.640
The specials only apply
to clients who take the card.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.760
Try "Elvira Giannini."

19:27.400 --> 19:29.440
Your wife's card?

19:30.680 --> 19:33.880
Ex-wife, actually. Does it still work?

19:34.600 --> 19:37.400
It depends. How long have you been apart?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.320
A few months.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.480
I'll pretend it's still yours.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.760
Thank you.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.360
-You're welcome.
-You're nice.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.320
It does change the total a bit.

19:54.400 --> 19:59.040
I'm alone with three teenagers.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.640
And Christmas coming up…

20:01.200 --> 20:03.240
It's hard, I'm not gonna lie.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.600
My break's in 30 minutes.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.360
Wait for me,
there's something you need to see.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.240
-Like what?
-It'll help save a lot of money.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.800
You'll want to see this.

20:18.920 --> 20:19.760
All right.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.280
Bye.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.440
Everybody in, please.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.440
Remember to drop your stuff.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.960
Virginie! You okay?

21:22.800 --> 21:23.840
What's all this?

21:25.120 --> 21:28.480
There's this stupid thing,
called "stock destruction."

21:29.000 --> 21:32.440
If it's not sold, it's destroyed.
Even if it's still edible.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.720
That's how absurd European directives are.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.840
We could give this out.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.440
Sure.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.720
Take what you want.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.880
Why are you doing all this?

21:50.800 --> 21:54.640
My horoscope said
this was the perfect day to make a friend.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.480
Right.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.080
I look like a homeless man.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.800
-You're pitying me.
-On the contrary, you're quite stylish.

22:08.880 --> 22:12.160
Who'd let you get away?
One should beg to keep you.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.720
I can't believe your wife dumped you.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.880
She didn't.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.840
I asked her to leave and never come back.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.720
She lied to me. A terrible lie, too.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.920
-Completely crazy.
-Really?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.440
You know what? She sent me a letter

22:27.520 --> 22:29.720
asking for a family Christmas.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.280
How dare she! And?

22:32.080 --> 22:33.680
I tore up the letter.

22:33.760 --> 22:37.240
Well done, that's the spirit.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.400
-Why?
-She's trying to keep up appearances.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.760
Out of pride. No love there.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.800
-You think?
-You should despise her.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.880
That's how you deal with it.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.400
Don't give her a chance to hurt you.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.480
You want some advice? Don't call her.

22:56.600 --> 22:57.920
You like pineapple?

23:20.240 --> 23:21.480
Elvira?

23:21.560 --> 23:22.640
Thanks.

23:24.160 --> 23:27.680
-What did he say?
-Nothing. He's looking for you.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.600
It's nice to see you.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.480
This place feels sad without you.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.120
Thanks for the tea, and biscuits.
They're my favorite.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.120
I'm not allowed to have them.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.720
I'm in my purification phase.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.080
I have an idea.

23:55.640 --> 23:56.480
It fits.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.600
Delicious.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.040
Clemence.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.120
I need your help.

24:05.760 --> 24:06.600
Of course.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.520
-Yes?
-Hello, Patrick.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
Is this a bad time?

24:41.520 --> 24:43.760
It is, a bit. I'm about to take a nap.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.080
It's been a busy day.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.160
I need help.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.760
My husband's not here.

24:50.440 --> 24:51.400
It'll be quick.

24:52.080 --> 24:52.920
Please.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.400
What did you two talk about?

26:37.480 --> 26:38.640
Well…

26:39.680 --> 26:40.520
Here.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.680
Have you noticed our tap water's
sometimes a bit murky?

26:45.400 --> 26:46.400
Not really.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.000
-No smell?
-No.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.680
To be fair,

26:52.320 --> 26:54.640
I'm not using much water at the moment.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.440
Here.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.240
My husband and I would like
to start a group,

27:03.320 --> 27:06.160
and find out what's wrong
with the water supply.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.480
It's a great idea,
but what does it have to do with me?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.880
I'm interested in your input.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.880
As… a member of our community.

27:20.480 --> 27:21.720
Also…

27:25.920 --> 27:26.960
Also?

27:27.040 --> 27:29.160
Would you mind terribly
if I had some wine?

28:06.720 --> 28:07.840
Mom?

28:20.920 --> 28:22.640
It feels weird saying it.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.240
You scared me.

28:28.360 --> 28:29.600
Say it in Italian.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.480
Speak to me in my mother tongue.

28:34.760 --> 28:37.120
In my dreams, you speak Italian.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.240
I've forgotten how.

28:42.440 --> 28:44.040
You need to try.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.160
And we'll meet halfway.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.200
You see?

29:01.800 --> 29:02.640
Come.

29:15.040 --> 29:15.960
Refill?

29:18.240 --> 29:21.400
Let's talk about it some other time.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.840
I had no sleep last night.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.360
Wait.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.200
I'd like…

29:28.320 --> 29:29.760
I'd like to dance.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.320
Just one dance.

29:32.400 --> 29:36.840
Well… no. I mean, not right now.

29:36.920 --> 29:40.200
I have to nap before the kids get home.

29:40.280 --> 29:41.120
One dance.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.840
Thanks, it's been nice chatting.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.360
Patrick.

29:45.440 --> 29:48.320
You're hurting me a bit, Clemence.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.440
You're squeezing too hard.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.360
I have to try.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.480
Are you all right?

29:55.280 --> 29:56.120
I'm not.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.840
I have something to say.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.440
Yes?

30:00.520 --> 30:01.880
But I don't know what.

30:01.960 --> 30:02.800
You don't?

30:03.760 --> 30:04.880
Something…

30:05.640 --> 30:06.880
Something important.

30:08.280 --> 30:09.560
But I can't get it out.

30:10.720 --> 30:11.560
It's…

30:12.640 --> 30:13.800
It's stuck, right here.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.320
I see.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.800
I totally get it. I get it too, sometimes.

30:19.880 --> 30:22.240
Feels like something lodged there,

30:22.320 --> 30:24.360
like a ball down your throat.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.280
It's painful, isn't it?

30:26.360 --> 30:28.280
It is, very painful.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.480
It feels like…

30:30.320 --> 30:32.760
Like a big egg, stuck and ready to burst.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.240
That's it exactly.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.280
Unfortunately, I'm familiar.

30:40.680 --> 30:41.680
Sit down.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.560
Will you please stay with me
a little while?

30:46.640 --> 30:48.360
I'm having a panic attack.

30:48.440 --> 30:52.240
When it happens to me,
my kids put me through an exercise.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.920
Let me show you.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.640
Breathe in through your nose
and count to four.

30:57.760 --> 30:58.600
Nice and slow.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.880
And let it all out.

31:01.960 --> 31:02.800
Again.

31:15.560 --> 31:16.800
I can't stay.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.560
In case the others come home.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.720
No, no. Don't worry.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.560
We still have time.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.360
Now.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.240
Cook me some pasta.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.200
What?

31:35.600 --> 31:36.960
I want pasta.

31:57.720 --> 31:58.880
What would you like?

32:01.800 --> 32:03.080
Pasta.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.440
With a bit of garlic and olive oil.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.800
What do you want from me?

32:11.400 --> 32:13.400
To spend some time with you.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.880
Mother and son.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.720
I want you to cook for me.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.920
And… I want to hear about my dad.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.040
Who is he?

32:30.280 --> 32:33.840
And then…
I want to tell everyone the truth.

32:34.840 --> 32:38.000
I need my sisters and brother
to know who I am.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.080
All right. We'll just have to wait
for the right time.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.000
It'll never come.

32:43.640 --> 32:46.560
We need to decide when,
or it'll never happen.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.200
I'm not ready.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.840
-In Italian, please.
-I am not ready.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.320
-Let me go.
-Wait. The door's locked.

32:58.240 --> 33:01.480
I'll get it.
You leave through the back door.

33:02.840 --> 33:05.200
Mom, listen to me.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.080
As soon as I call you, you come. Okay?

33:09.760 --> 33:10.760
Right away.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.320
Or I'll tell him everything.

33:24.000 --> 33:24.840
Hello.

33:25.920 --> 33:26.760
Hello.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.720
Is Patrick home?

33:29.800 --> 33:31.640
No, he's out.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.720
Is he?

33:35.880 --> 33:37.960
I'm Jeff, his brother.

33:38.960 --> 33:41.720
I'm Lorenzo. Distant cousin.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.440
I was making pasta.

33:46.520 --> 33:47.520
Want some?

33:48.400 --> 33:50.880
I'm not hungry.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.200
I just broke up with my fiancée.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.120
Look…

34:03.480 --> 34:04.360
Come on in.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.640
A SEASON ON NEPTUNE

34:17.800 --> 34:19.880
Your parents aren't answering.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.000
Any other relative I could call?

34:42.840 --> 34:44.000
-Bye.
-Bye.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.600
You know the principal?

34:47.680 --> 34:48.520
Yes.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.960
He's been at the house.

34:51.560 --> 34:55.120
He's been through a difficult time.
We helped.

34:58.240 --> 35:00.400
I've got snacks waiting for you.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.000
Pierre made waffles.

35:02.080 --> 35:05.080
Thanks for taking care of me.
Thank God you're here.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.520
Thanks.

35:29.320 --> 35:30.600
I just don't get it.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.600
The trip went so well.

35:36.280 --> 35:38.320
Three weeks alone.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.320
Well, with Leo.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.440
In the middle of nowhere.

35:48.240 --> 35:49.840
Just like in the movies.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.720
-<i>And then…</i>
-Thanks.

35:53.800 --> 35:54.720
Take care.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.240
I've asked my mom to babysit Leo tonight.
I'm seeing someone.

36:07.760 --> 36:08.880
Isa, no.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.080
Remember what we said?

36:12.480 --> 36:14.760
We're together, but we're free.

36:18.160 --> 36:19.880
Didn't we just have a great time?

36:19.960 --> 36:23.080
We did. It's fine for three weeks,
not for years.

36:23.960 --> 36:27.640
A year is just a bunch of weeks piled up.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.920
Let me be frank with you, okay?

36:31.800 --> 36:34.120
Don't feel you have to.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.160
I don't admire you.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.600
Say what?

36:38.680 --> 36:39.960
I mean it.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.680
You're the sweetest guy
but I have no admiration for you.

36:43.440 --> 36:46.200
For me to be exclusive, to love

36:46.280 --> 36:48.840
and to fuck the same person every day,
I need that.

36:54.520 --> 36:55.360
Okay.

36:57.160 --> 37:00.160
Sorry. But I did warn you.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.200
I'll leave you alone, then.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.040
You know…

37:10.600 --> 37:14.400
Maybe being sweet is something
worthy of admiration.

37:15.080 --> 37:19.000
Maybe being gentle is worth admiring.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.960
Maybe being safe,

37:22.000 --> 37:23.120
always on time,

37:24.400 --> 37:27.800
being reliable, is worth admiring.

37:29.720 --> 37:30.560
Anyway.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.520
We live in different worlds.

37:34.040 --> 37:38.200
Your world, the one built
on bling, on showing off,

37:38.760 --> 37:40.040
that's clearly not me.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.400
You said that?

37:48.000 --> 37:50.200
All but the last sentence.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.160
I did kick the bin.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.480
She doesn't deserve you.

37:57.760 --> 38:00.400
Elvira's friends are all rotten.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.000
Dad?

38:09.960 --> 38:10.840
Hi.

38:11.840 --> 38:12.680
Good evening.

38:13.640 --> 38:14.480
Where were you?

38:18.120 --> 38:19.760
You weren't answering the phone.

38:27.480 --> 38:30.760
-Virginie fainted at school.
-Really?

38:31.360 --> 38:32.200
Yes.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.280
They tried to call you.

38:36.600 --> 38:39.360
I turned off my phone.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.840
You must be careful.

38:43.080 --> 38:46.680
Virginie's surrounded
by unsettling vibrations.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.440
What does that mean?

38:52.560 --> 38:55.680
She's different from other girls.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.200
She's very sensitive.

39:00.640 --> 39:04.600
It's like she's channeling
those vibrations. Invisible to you,

39:05.720 --> 39:07.040
but very bad for her.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.320
Like a bat?

39:11.040 --> 39:12.040
Exactly.

39:13.640 --> 39:14.720
Like a bat.

39:15.960 --> 39:19.160
She can sense things are going on,
even when you won't tell her.

39:20.040 --> 39:22.360
Sense events you won't mention to her.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.080
Do you understand?

39:26.880 --> 39:28.160
Of course.

39:28.760 --> 39:32.360
When I was a kid, I was just the same.

39:34.480 --> 39:35.320
Like a bat.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.840
You do understand, then.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.240
I do.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.480
I just loved it, really.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.040
I'm actually very impressed.

39:51.480 --> 39:52.320
By what?

39:56.000 --> 39:57.360
The characters.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.960
How you describe stuff, beautifully.
And the plot.

40:02.040 --> 40:05.040
I'm not too sure I understood it all.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.360
But…

40:07.200 --> 40:08.520
The-- Listen.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.680
The characters…

40:10.280 --> 40:12.640
What they're saying,
I've had the same thoughts

40:13.160 --> 40:15.160
but never the words.

40:18.240 --> 40:19.640
That's a bit light.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.200
What did you like about them?

40:24.800 --> 40:26.560
-Say, the narrator.
-The narrator?

40:29.400 --> 40:30.920
Well…

40:32.800 --> 40:34.480
There's this…

40:34.560 --> 40:36.120
His audacity, maybe?

40:36.200 --> 40:37.960
That's exactly it.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.960
The audacity, but more than that.

40:43.280 --> 40:46.080
I liked his ambivalence.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.240
I really liked that.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.760
Very interesting ambivalence.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.720
There's no ambivalence whatsoever.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.720
-No?
-He's very clear about things.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.000
Very sure of his choices.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.560
Being a paradox is not being ambivalent.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.280
-Of course not.
-You're not getting it at all.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.240
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:11.760 --> 41:12.880
Ready?

41:12.960 --> 41:13.920
Let's go.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.320
-Go? Where?
-Is it your business?

41:20.600 --> 41:21.440
You read it too?

41:23.360 --> 41:25.160
-Good, isn't it?
-Yeah.

41:26.200 --> 41:29.120
Does the narrator feel ambivalent to you?

41:29.640 --> 41:32.760
-No, not at all.
-No, right?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.240
Let's go.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.160
See you.

42:04.520 --> 42:05.720
You okay, kitten?

42:08.680 --> 42:12.200
Do you want to eat? I made dinner.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.040
I made chicken and pineapple skewers.

42:17.680 --> 42:19.400
And pineapple cake.

42:20.360 --> 42:23.800
Well, it's really just pineapple
and some biscuits,

42:23.880 --> 42:27.280
and it'll turn into a cake in your belly.

42:29.440 --> 42:31.200
You're not laughing.

42:31.720 --> 42:32.560
No.

42:33.560 --> 42:34.880
I'm not hungry.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.520
-Should I call a doctor?
-No.

42:42.440 --> 42:43.920
I just need to sleep.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.040
Is it Christmas?

42:51.880 --> 42:53.720
Can you please leave?

42:56.200 --> 42:57.040
Sure.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.840
-Would you like some dinner?
-No, thanks.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.160
All right.

43:30.440 --> 43:32.640
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.240
Are you all right?

43:36.920 --> 43:37.760
Yes.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.720
Sorry, it's been a tough day.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.240
Want to talk about it?

43:45.240 --> 43:46.600
No. Too complicated.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.320
Are those for your kids?

43:52.440 --> 43:53.440
Not at all.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.800
They never replied, so I think it's a no.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.240
What's that doing here?

44:04.920 --> 44:06.280
Are you working again?

44:10.760 --> 44:13.400
Channa gave me a mission.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.360
The aluminum factory.

44:17.320 --> 44:19.640
They're a tough bunch.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.240
We got them, though.

44:25.760 --> 44:26.640
We did.

44:30.440 --> 44:32.080
-So?
-Well.

44:32.720 --> 44:34.440
They want more guarantees.

44:34.520 --> 44:35.640
Do they?

44:37.360 --> 44:38.680
They're threatening us.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.600
-Have you ever been?
-No.

44:44.680 --> 44:47.000
-You'd love it.
-Yeah?

44:47.080 --> 44:49.640
It's so sunny.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.280
I think I failed the mock <i>bac.</i>

45:16.920 --> 45:18.520
Really.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.640
I hear your sister.

47:42.280 --> 47:44.760
We'll all be together.

47:48.040 --> 47:49.200
What's up?

47:49.920 --> 47:50.880
Sit down.

47:51.560 --> 47:53.080
I made pineapple toast.

48:00.080 --> 48:04.120
We've all decided to always
tell each other the truth. Here it is.

48:04.640 --> 48:06.120
Your mom wrote me a letter,

48:07.480 --> 48:10.480
asking for us to spend Christmas together.

48:10.560 --> 48:12.880
I'm obviously against it.

48:14.240 --> 48:15.600
I'm not ready at all.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.880
Seeing Elvira would be

48:18.960 --> 48:20.920
a terrible shock,
especially for Christmas.

48:21.520 --> 48:24.080
There you have it. I wanted to tell you

48:24.160 --> 48:26.920
so we can all decide. Together. Calmly.

48:29.720 --> 48:31.640
I'm not ready either.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.240
Can we vote?

48:35.320 --> 48:37.040
Okay. Let's vote.

48:37.120 --> 48:38.360
I'm voting no.

48:38.960 --> 48:39.800
Me too.

48:40.640 --> 48:41.800
I vote yes.

48:43.960 --> 48:46.040
"Yes"? It's a tie.

48:46.120 --> 48:47.960
How about we flip a coin?

48:48.760 --> 48:49.880
Let's do that.

48:55.240 --> 48:56.560
Tails, she comes.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.240
Heads, she doesn't.

49:00.200 --> 49:01.040
All clear?

49:09.120 --> 49:11.640
On Neptune, winter lasts for 40 years.

49:47.720 --> 49:50.080
