<i>Ooh child
Things are gonna get easier</i>

00:07.090 --> 00:12.012
<i>Ooh child
Things'll get brighter</i>

00:13.263 --> 00:18.602
<i>Ooh child
Things are gonna get easier</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:24.233
<i>Ooh child
Things'll get brighter</i>

02:26.647 --> 02:32.402
<i>We brothers, we brothers</i>

02:32.986 --> 02:37.032
<i>We brothers, so strong</i>

02:38.158 --> 02:42.829
<i>We brothers, we brothers</i>

02:53.382 --> 02:56.927
<i>We brothers, so strong</i>

02:56.927 --> 02:58.846
- Ay.
- So what?

02:58.846 --> 03:02.516
<i>We brothers, we brothers</i>

03:02.516 --> 03:03.809
Hey, who we gonna be?

03:03.809 --> 03:07.062
<i>We brothers, so strong</i>

03:07.062 --> 03:08.438
Hey, who we gonna be?

03:36.008 --> 03:39.595
<i>Welcome to
the Maryland State Basketball Championship</i>

03:39.595 --> 03:44.892
<i>between Seat Pleasant High
and Cedar Cove Prep High School.</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:54.401
Talk to us. Who's winning state?

03:56.570 --> 03:57.571
They both seem solid.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.408
Nah, Icon,
you ain't getting off that easy, brother.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.285
You played at Seat Pleasant,

04:03.285 --> 04:05.204
and Phil Marksby,
who you coached in club ball,

04:05.204 --> 04:06.955
- plays for them now.
- Didn't even notice.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.750
You notice the starters in Cedar Cove
played for you as well?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.669
Jace Carson and Nick Mendez?
Top 30 in the nation.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.797
They won two national ABO Championships
with you.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.132
You teach them everything you know?

04:19.176 --> 04:21.220
- That's a hell, yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.597
- And they learned a lot more than that.
- Amen.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.516
I'm not even mad at y'all.

04:41.865 --> 04:42.866
My bad.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.752
My bad.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.091
Ay! Shot!

04:59.091 --> 05:01.885
That's a foul. Hold up! That's a foul!

05:01.885 --> 05:04.346
Back, back, back, back. Drop.
Switch it. Switch it, Jace.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.773
Our babies are all grown up.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.443
What the hell?

05:18.443 --> 05:20.028
No more diapers.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.030
That was a mistake.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.367
- Aight.
- Ay, shake it off.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.702
- That's a bet.
- Right here. Come on.

05:31.582 --> 05:32.791
<i>Offensive foul!</i>

05:33.375 --> 05:36.670
Come on, Ref. He's flopping. Come on.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.131
- Let's go.
- Come on, man.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.133
- Wrap 'em up. Let's go!
- Come on, Jace.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.070
That's how we do it.

06:39.775 --> 06:40.776
Whoo!

07:10.013 --> 07:14.852
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

07:14.852 --> 07:20.107
- No. Give me the ball, bro. No.
- ...five, four, three, two, one.

07:23.235 --> 07:28.407
<i>Final Score.
Seat Pleasant, 63. Cedar Cove Prep, 71.</i>

07:29.074 --> 07:34.538
<i>The new state champions...
Cedar Cove Mustangs.</i>

07:51.346 --> 07:52.347
Hey, big man.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.365
Good job.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.827
I love you.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.537
Love-- I love you too.

08:25.380 --> 08:30.135
Come on, man!
You know what time it is! Yeah!

08:36.308 --> 08:39.352
I'm talking about, Son.
I'm so proud of you.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.313
- We did it, Pop. We did it.
- Yeah, we-- Yes. You did that.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.191
You did that.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.693
Thank you.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.404
- Coach. Fantastic game.
- Ms. Diane.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.532
- That was the kids.
- They're state champions.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.325
- Can I get an interview with you?
- Yes, of course.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.493
Cool. Set up.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.246
Set up.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.122
Let me know.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.836
- All right, rolling. Yeah.
- I'm good?

09:03.836 --> 09:06.588
I'm here today with Dr. Emory Lawson.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.549
Athletic Director at Cedar Cove Prep.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.927
Dr. Lawson, what does
the state championship mean to you?

09:11.927 --> 09:15.097
At Cedar Cove, excellence is our charge.

09:15.097 --> 09:17.933
These young men answered the call,
and frankly, I'd expect nothing less.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.017
Miss Durant.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.895
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey. I'm good. I'm Jenna.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.189
- Hi, Jenna.
- I'm Jace Carson's mother.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.275
You have yourself a serious baller there.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.986
Thank you.
He's going into his senior year.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.737
Is there any advice you could give me?

09:31.780 --> 09:36.159
Some of the people that love your son,
will love to hate him.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.455
But don't let that get to him or to you.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.541
Thank you. Okay.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.667
- All right?
- All right.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.460
All right. It's a pleasure meeting you.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.965
Great year, Coach.

09:53.719 --> 09:54.720
Yo!

09:56.513 --> 09:57.723
Proud of you.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.266
Ay, state!

09:59.266 --> 10:01.101
Yup. Hell, yeah.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.186
Hell, yeah.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.731
No matter who's holding the clipboard,
I'm here 'cause of you.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.609
I'm proud of us. Aight?

10:11.653 --> 10:12.654
Aight. Love you, man.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.906
- I'm gonna tap in, all right?
- All right.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.534
Love you too.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.516
What is he doing here?

11:25.269 --> 11:26.478
Can I help you?

11:27.855 --> 11:28.981
I'm just looking for someone.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.358
Hey, big man.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.443
Thanks for pulling up, bro.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.280
Sup, dog.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.323
Hey. He's with me, all right. Come on.

11:38.824 --> 11:41.493
Come on, man. You see how we do it
over here at Cedar Cove.

11:41.994 --> 11:43.203
This turn up is crazy.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.371
Candace house.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.083
Hey, bro, I didn't realize
you was the next Michael B. Jordan.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.168
Now don't start that.

11:49.168 --> 11:50.502
You acted your ass off.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.504
Floppin' and shit.

11:53.297 --> 11:57.676
I baited you, then I got inside your head.
Kinda like I always do.

11:57.676 --> 12:00.387
Hey, you got inside the referee's head.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.472
If we breathed on you,
his whistle came out.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.225
Man, I remember Cedar Cove wanted you too.

12:06.435 --> 12:07.811
Could've been down with us.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.107
And be a part
of Jace Carson's supporting cast?

12:12.983 --> 12:15.235
Bruh, I've been there. Done that.

12:20.324 --> 12:24.203
Crazy number of scouts were there,
anyone hit you up?

12:26.580 --> 12:30.000
Saint Johns, Syracuse...

12:32.085 --> 12:33.337
Few others. You?

12:34.004 --> 12:38.425
Wake Forest, UCLA, a few others.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.093
Hey, you left it all out there, bro.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.678
And congrats.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.098
This year's gonna go by fast, man.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.518
I'ma go one and done,

12:48.936 --> 12:51.271
then I'ma enter the draft.

12:51.855 --> 12:55.692
Bruh, we're two years away from the NBA.

12:55.692 --> 12:56.777
It's crazy, right?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.074
We look so pretty.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.869
Bro, what in the world?

13:07.287 --> 13:08.539
All eyes on us.

13:11.834 --> 13:12.835
Can't mess this up.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.658
Flight okay coming out?

15:07.658 --> 15:10.285
Yeah, it was cool. It was a little tight.

15:10.285 --> 15:15.707
You're a big boy, it's gonna be tight.
You like California so far?

15:15.707 --> 15:21.672
- Yeah. Oh, Coach, you did not-- What?
- We had to do it for you.

15:24.383 --> 15:27.052
Yo. Mom, that's your boy.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.388
Twenty-five.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.432
UCLA has more national championships

15:32.432 --> 15:35.143
than any program
in the history of college basketball.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.646
There are over a dozen Bruins
on NBA rosters right now,

15:37.646 --> 15:41.358
Jrue Holiday, Zach LaVine, Westbrook.
You know the names.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.694
Yes, sir.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.612
Mm-hmm.

15:48.574 --> 15:50.784
Given all of your options,
you have to decide.

15:52.953 --> 15:56.206
Do you want to be good at the next level?
Or do you wanna be great?

16:13.140 --> 16:14.224
What do you think?

16:16.643 --> 16:19.438
I like it. I like it here.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.691
It's far away from home though.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.574
What do you think, Mom?

16:31.742 --> 16:33.243
It's far away from home.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.376
This is a great opportunity.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.255
I'm so proud of you.

16:46.465 --> 16:47.633
Hold up.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.134
I know you not trying to cry right now.

16:49.134 --> 16:50.886
Boy, shut up and give me a hug.

16:51.512 --> 16:52.513
Give me a hug.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.015
I'm so proud of you.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.314
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

17:02.314 --> 17:05.442
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

17:05.442 --> 17:07.486
<i>Happy birthday</i>

17:13.742 --> 17:15.702
- Wait.
- Y'all, hold on. Let me get it.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.037
Let me get it.

17:17.621 --> 17:18.622
Okay.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.002
Hey, you okay?

17:24.502 --> 17:27.089
Daddy, I don't feel so good.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.300
What's wrong, baby? Your stomach hurt?

17:31.510 --> 17:32.511
Okay.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.264
It's okay.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.271
How is she?

17:43.397 --> 17:44.481
Out like a light.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.151
Good. Well, maybe next time

17:48.652 --> 17:51.113
when I tell her
she can only have two slices of pizza,

17:51.113 --> 17:54.324
you will refrain from saying,
"But it's her birthday."

17:55.868 --> 17:59.246
As long as you avoid the,
"I told you so" look.

18:01.331 --> 18:04.168
But I have been waiting
to give you that look all day, so--

18:07.588 --> 18:10.007
All right, go ahead.

18:15.470 --> 18:16.513
Happy?

18:16.513 --> 18:17.639
Very.

18:21.059 --> 18:24.521
There you go. Come on.
Use your fingertips, not your palms.

18:24.521 --> 18:27.191
Nice. Nice, there you go.
You got rhythm, you got rhythm.

18:27.191 --> 18:29.985
- Coach Bailey.
- Hey, Coach.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.781
Keep moving your feet. All right.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.839
Fellas,
if we continue to have unforced turnovers,

18:50.839 --> 18:52.299
we're only beating ourselves.

18:52.883 --> 18:55.093
If we beat ourselves,
they'll eat us alive.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.388
So, go get some water. Let's run it again.
All right?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.810
- I like how you handled that, Coach.
- Really?

19:03.810 --> 19:04.937
For sure.

19:05.437 --> 19:08.148
I mean, turnovers like that
make me wanna throw up.

19:09.066 --> 19:11.818
- How 'bout you, Meg?
- Yeah, it's enough to make me wanna puke.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.154
Y'all done?

19:14.154 --> 19:16.698
It depends. You wanna see the videos?

19:16.698 --> 19:18.367
I've only seen it ten times.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.328
I'm fine. I'm cool off the damn video.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.497
- You sure? Because I'll put it on TikTok.
- No, no, no.

19:23.497 --> 19:24.998
I promise you, I don't--

19:26.959 --> 19:28.043
Is Kathryn okay?

19:28.043 --> 19:29.920
Yeah, they make 'em pretty durable now.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.131
I can't believe she's three already.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.050
Yeah, and the wife is getting stir-crazy.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.718
Tonya wants to get back in the workforce,

19:36.718 --> 19:37.845
but I don't think my old job

19:37.845 --> 19:40.264
at Independence Tool and Repair
appeals to her.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.641
Yeah.
Somehow I think there's a better fit.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.227
- Yeah.
- I'll let her know if I hear of anything.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.145
I appreciate it.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.689
Can y'all hold it down?

19:49.189 --> 19:50.190
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no doubt. We got it.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.275
Bet.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.780
Let's go. Run it back.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.366
Principal Freeman.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.660
My apologies
for popping in on you like this, Isaac.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.621
- I called a couple of times.
- I'm sorry about that.

20:04.621 --> 20:08.625
We had a party for my daughter.
I was running all weekend.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.170
I understand. You have a few minutes?

20:12.421 --> 20:14.006
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- Thank you.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.218
It's a lot of work to do.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.387
Is everything okay with Phil?

20:20.888 --> 20:23.182
This is about Coach Washington.

20:24.683 --> 20:27.394
It's not public knowledge yet,
but he's retiring.

20:27.895 --> 20:28.896
Wow.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.816
He had a hell of a run.
What's that? Fourteen, 15 years?

20:33.317 --> 20:34.484
Seventeen.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.696
After your father,
he's the most successful coach we've had.

20:39.156 --> 20:41.200
I hope he gets the send-off he deserves.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.326
I'll see to it.

20:42.826 --> 20:46.205
You know, I was a new teacher
when your father was coach,

20:46.205 --> 20:48.415
I asked him about his philosophy.

20:48.415 --> 20:53.253
- He told me it was, "To love the game"--
- "But love the players more."

20:54.588 --> 20:56.757
Yeah. He was a great man.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.885
He was.

20:59.885 --> 21:03.889
You've had amazing success
with your basketball program.

21:03.889 --> 21:06.058
A couple of National Championships.

21:06.558 --> 21:09.311
Former players
who are on the NBA trajectory.

21:09.311 --> 21:13.398
And you were one of the best guards
we've had in our school's history.

21:14.399 --> 21:18.278
We'd love for you to come home
and become our next head coach.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.960
I don't know what to say.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.336
You can say yes.

21:36.296 --> 21:37.881
But you take a couple of days.

21:38.382 --> 21:41.343
I'm sure it's not as lucrative
as your grassroots team here.

21:41.343 --> 21:45.389
This is about
continuing an incredible legacy.

21:45.389 --> 21:47.599
Yours and your father's.

22:08.871 --> 22:12.666
Damn! Ten dollars for a smoothie?
It gotta come with a toy or something.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.251
I know, right?

22:20.382 --> 22:21.383
You getting any looks?

22:23.093 --> 22:24.803
- You Jace Carson, right?
- Yeah.

22:24.803 --> 22:27.014
I used to see you
on the circuit in club ball.

22:27.014 --> 22:29.808
I was, like, 15U. You were 12U.

22:31.059 --> 22:33.187
We used to check you out
every chance we got.

22:33.812 --> 22:35.564
We were saying, man, "Shorty's got next."

22:36.148 --> 22:38.734
I appreciate you, man. What's your name?

22:38.734 --> 22:40.152
I'm Semaj.

22:41.028 --> 22:42.404
Samson?

22:43.363 --> 22:45.949
- Used to play for Kentucky, right?
- A few years.

22:46.450 --> 22:48.076
Overseas for a hot minute.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.996
Now, I'm just trying to make some dough
while I figure out what's next.

22:50.996 --> 22:53.081
- I feel you.
- How 'bout you?

22:55.167 --> 22:56.460
Getting a couple looks.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.921
Still trying to decide my next move.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.256
I feel you.

23:02.466 --> 23:05.552
- Hey, can we take a picture?
- For sure.

23:37.668 --> 23:40.921
I've been able to rent a house now
for the last couple years.

23:40.921 --> 23:45.050
Not just because of hard work,
but because of vision.

23:45.968 --> 23:48.053
Things turned around for me
when I realized

23:48.053 --> 23:52.933
that we're not selling cosmetics
and skin care to make someone attractive.

23:53.559 --> 23:58.021
Our mission is
to tap into our customers' inner beauty

23:58.021 --> 24:03.235
and to provide products that illuminate
what's already there.

24:04.111 --> 24:05.320
- Right?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

24:06.071 --> 24:10.325
A lot of significant others,
asleep behind the wheel,

24:11.159 --> 24:13.996
they're not telling their queens
that they are beautiful.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.773
- How you doing, sir?
- My man.

24:48.864 --> 24:51.491
Saw this guy today. Semaj Samson.

24:52.075 --> 24:55.662
Played at Kentucky, then went overseas.

24:57.039 --> 25:00.292
Didn't get drafted.
Now he's making smoothies for a living.

25:04.421 --> 25:07.049
Honestly,
I can't say I'm much better than he was.

25:07.049 --> 25:08.509
Honestly, I can.

25:09.092 --> 25:11.512
- You don't know who I'm talking about.
- I don't need to.

25:19.311 --> 25:20.312
Maybe he didn't make it

25:20.312 --> 25:22.022
'cause he doesn't have
a mom as good as you.

25:22.981 --> 25:24.942
You just earned you some more lasagna.

25:24.942 --> 25:28.987
I got it. I don't know
what Jackie's eating in college,

25:28.987 --> 25:30.822
but she ain't eating as good as this.

25:30.822 --> 25:34.493
Her go-to meal is Cheerios
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

25:36.995 --> 25:39.665
My NIL agent has something to pitch to us.

25:40.791 --> 25:44.628
Something about an apparel company
wanting me to rock their gear.

25:44.628 --> 25:46.421
You should've told your agents

25:46.421 --> 25:48.841
that you appreciate the two G's
a month they give you

25:48.841 --> 25:50.968
to sign photos and merchandise.

25:50.968 --> 25:54.888
Beyond that, nobody's gonna care
about your name, image or likeness

25:54.888 --> 25:58.517
if you don't continue to elevate your game
and studies.

26:00.435 --> 26:03.272
Come on, Ma.
I told 'em we'd be happy to hear 'em out.

26:03.897 --> 26:07.109
Well, I'm happy that they changed the game
for amateur athletes.

26:07.651 --> 26:11.655
And I don't have any problem with you
putting money into your savings,

26:11.655 --> 26:14.908
but they need to understand
that I'm working two jobs

26:14.908 --> 26:17.327
so that you don't have to worry
about money.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.997
This is a very important year for you.

26:19.997 --> 26:21.582
You don't need distractions.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.001
Ma.

26:27.754 --> 26:32.384
There are some high-school players
making 20,000 a month now.

26:32.885 --> 26:34.636
Trust, I am focused.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.055
And I like having my own money.

26:37.639 --> 26:38.682
No living in fear.

26:45.814 --> 26:46.815
Fine.

28:16.154 --> 28:18.532
<i>Take over, Ike. No one better.</i>

29:25.849 --> 29:27.017
That boy cold.

29:29.061 --> 29:30.062
What's up?

29:31.897 --> 29:33.148
Mr. Mendez.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.609
- Good to see you.
- Back at it for another one.

29:35.609 --> 29:36.693
Let's do it.

29:42.783 --> 29:44.243
Stretch.

29:45.369 --> 29:47.996
You joining us in our stretch today,
Mr. Mendez?

29:52.584 --> 29:58.173
One of the reasons I fought as
athletic director to teach a history class

29:59.007 --> 30:00.008
is for this lesson.

30:00.968 --> 30:04.680
It's a subject that is near and dear
to my heart.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.933
Now, I trust you all did your reading,
so I turn it over to you.

30:13.021 --> 30:16.483
What makes us a democracy?

30:18.694 --> 30:22.322
Our ability to pursue our own dreams,

30:22.322 --> 30:26.118
our religious freedoms,
and our abilities to elect our leaders.

30:26.743 --> 30:28.245
What about you, Mr. Mendez?

30:28.245 --> 30:31.248
Do you agree with Matthew's declarations?

30:32.499 --> 30:34.835
I agree in theory.

30:38.714 --> 30:40.340
But not in application?

30:42.676 --> 30:46.638
My family and friends are in Puerto Rico.
They can't even vote in Federal Elections.

30:46.638 --> 30:50.434
Puerto Rico does not participate
in Federal Elections.

30:50.434 --> 30:51.643
What about you, Ellie?

30:52.311 --> 30:54.980
Are we failing our democracy?

30:54.980 --> 30:58.400
I think we'll always have our shortcomings
and room for improvement,

30:58.400 --> 31:00.152
but that doesn't mean
we're not a democracy.

31:00.152 --> 31:01.236
So you're saying

31:01.236 --> 31:03.572
when women didn't have
the right to vote in this country,

31:03.572 --> 31:04.990
it was still democratic?

31:04.990 --> 31:07.367
Hold on. How do you answer that question,
Mr. Carson?

31:15.542 --> 31:19.713
Saying it's a democracy
doesn't make it a democracy.

31:21.006 --> 31:24.843
Women protested and got the right to vote,
and we made democracy better.

31:24.843 --> 31:28.096
But we only could have made that happen
in a democratic society.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.849
Black people didn't feel this was
a democratic society

31:30.849 --> 31:32.267
when we were denied our rights.

31:32.267 --> 31:37.439
And now you have touched upon
our big project for this semester.

31:37.439 --> 31:41.109
Is democracy a destination?

31:43.445 --> 31:46.573
Or is democracy...

31:50.869 --> 31:51.912
a journey?

32:03.131 --> 32:06.218
For the record, my parents bought
a vacation home in Puerto Rico.

32:06.218 --> 32:07.344
We love it there.

32:49.553 --> 32:50.679
Yes! That's my baby.

32:50.679 --> 32:53.557
Go, Jace! Go, Jace! Come on, Jace!

32:53.557 --> 32:55.100
You've got this, babe!

32:56.101 --> 32:57.728
Yes, Jace!

33:02.983 --> 33:04.234
Ay!

33:06.695 --> 33:07.738
That's a foul!

33:07.738 --> 33:08.822
Ref!

33:11.325 --> 33:12.576
- Are you good?
- Back up.

33:12.576 --> 33:13.911
- Come on, man.
- Help.

33:19.416 --> 33:21.251
Real slow. You're okay. Here.

33:23.712 --> 33:24.713
Yo.

33:29.218 --> 33:32.095
Hey, boys, bring it in here. Come on.

33:33.263 --> 33:37.309
Listen, he's gonna be fine, all right?
He's got the wind knocked out of him.

33:37.809 --> 33:41.230
This is our game.
CJ, you're in. Johnny, you're in.

33:41.230 --> 33:43.398
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Yo, come on.

33:48.779 --> 33:49.780
Stay on him.

33:50.739 --> 33:52.449
Come on, get back, get back.

34:00.415 --> 34:02.751
Man up! Let's go!

34:13.094 --> 34:14.471
Swing it! Swing it!

34:27.650 --> 34:30.529
CJ. CJ, right.

34:50.174 --> 34:52.676
It was a good one. That was a great win.
Give it another round.

34:52.676 --> 34:53.927
Come on. Keep it going.

34:57.097 --> 35:02.144
Man. I'll tell you, I am--
I am so, so proud of each one of you.

35:02.728 --> 35:04.938
The amount of growth we've made,
and how quick we've made it.

35:04.938 --> 35:06.732
I mean, we got a pair of division titles.

35:06.732 --> 35:08.942
We've got a state championship.

35:11.695 --> 35:13.989
That's y'all.

35:14.907 --> 35:15.908
Listen, boys.

35:17.242 --> 35:19.661
What I've got to tell you,
there's never a great time for.

35:19.661 --> 35:21.788
So, I'm just going to shoot you straight
and tell you, okay?

35:21.788 --> 35:24.499
I've been offered an assistant
coaching job in North Carolina.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.419
Yeah. I don't know if you know this,

35:27.419 --> 35:32.466
but it has always been my dream
to be head coach at the next level,

35:32.466 --> 35:35.135
and I see this being the path to do that.

35:36.845 --> 35:42.476
Now, boys, I have loved every second

35:43.519 --> 35:45.562
of helping you all
accomplish your dreams. I have.

35:47.773 --> 35:48.774
Unfortunately, in--

35:50.275 --> 35:53.153
in this situation,
I have to pursue my own, okay?

35:57.908 --> 35:58.909
When are you leaving?

36:00.661 --> 36:01.662
Two weeks.

36:04.039 --> 36:07.125
I don't understand.
We're two weeks from our regular season.

36:07.709 --> 36:11.463
I've activated a search committee,
and we will find a suitable replacement.

36:12.422 --> 36:14.216
Listen, I'll be here meanwhile

36:14.216 --> 36:17.094
to make sure that transition happens
as smoothly as possible, boys.

36:18.220 --> 36:20.848
You said you'll do everything you can
to ensure we go back to State.

36:23.475 --> 36:26.520
I understand that, Jace. I do.

36:28.063 --> 36:30.607
This was unforeseen.

36:35.320 --> 36:39.199
Congratulations, Coach. Congratulations.

36:39.199 --> 36:42.619
Yeah. That's right. Congrats, Coach.

36:42.619 --> 36:43.620
Congratulations.

36:53.672 --> 36:55.382
These are delicious.

36:56.049 --> 36:57.217
They're Crystal's recipe.

36:57.217 --> 36:59.428
Her world-famous vegan brownies.

36:59.428 --> 37:02.139
Yet another reason to be impressed by you.

37:03.015 --> 37:04.016
Thank you, Coach.

37:04.683 --> 37:06.185
I don't mind telling you,

37:06.185 --> 37:08.937
we've been tracking you
for quite some time, Crystal.

37:10.230 --> 37:13.942
Now, a part of our identity at the
University of Maryland

37:13.942 --> 37:16.195
is defend, rebound and run.

37:17.613 --> 37:21.325
All three things that you've been doing
at the highest level.

37:22.075 --> 37:25.162
I think you would be
a great fit for our program.

37:26.455 --> 37:31.835
I've been a huge fan of UMD
for as long as I can remember.

37:33.545 --> 37:37.090
Do you like the idea of your parents
being able to see you play in person?

37:39.092 --> 37:40.093
Very much so.

37:40.093 --> 37:42.054
It'd be a dream come true.

37:42.971 --> 37:44.640
I wouldn't be too upset.

37:46.099 --> 37:48.727
What we'd like to do
is have you come visit us on campus.

37:48.727 --> 37:50.562
We'll show you around

37:50.562 --> 37:55.234
and see if you think the school
is as good a fit for you as we do.

37:57.945 --> 38:00.030
Because we're offering you a full ride.

38:04.743 --> 38:05.661
Thank you, Coach.

39:09.016 --> 39:11.435
No, well, I've only been out
of the workforce for three years,

39:11.435 --> 39:15.063
and these salaries that they offer me
is like I'm a college kid on summer break.

39:15.564 --> 39:16.982
It's no joke out there.

39:17.566 --> 39:20.777
You know, you can always come and work
with Holly Ann Cosmetics.

39:20.777 --> 39:22.070
So you can fire me?

39:22.070 --> 39:23.238
Girl, no.

39:24.531 --> 39:27.868
Coach, did you hear about Nichols
moving on to North Carolina?

39:28.452 --> 39:30.287
Yeah, I heard. I'm sorry about that.

39:30.287 --> 39:33.332
Looks like they're thinking about
bringing in Camden Ryder,

39:34.082 --> 39:35.584
some dude from overseas.

39:36.585 --> 39:37.586
What you think?

39:39.171 --> 39:43.926
Well, Camden did have some issues
with his temper when he was in the NBA.

39:43.926 --> 39:46.303
Hopefully, he's matured since then.

39:46.303 --> 39:49.681
Jace has got too much
riding on his senior year to be hoping.

39:49.681 --> 39:50.766
That part.

39:50.766 --> 39:53.519
We need to know he's with someone
who will watch his back.

39:53.519 --> 39:54.645
Yeah, for sure.

39:56.021 --> 39:59.066
I'll ask around and see what else
I can find out about him.

39:59.066 --> 40:01.276
And then give me the name
of the overseas guy.

40:04.363 --> 40:08.242
You don't know anyone else interested
in coaching high school basketball?

40:10.786 --> 40:11.954
No one at all?

40:19.545 --> 40:20.838
Who told y'all?

40:20.838 --> 40:22.047
Told us what?

40:22.548 --> 40:23.549
Okay, I got it.

40:24.216 --> 40:28.303
I tell Naim, Naim tells Musa,
and Musa tells you.

40:28.804 --> 40:31.348
Or my mom's just psychic.

40:33.725 --> 40:34.977
Look, it's--

40:36.395 --> 40:40.315
It's not that I'm interested
in coaching high school ball.

40:41.316 --> 40:43.902
But Seat Pleasant?

40:45.153 --> 40:47.656
That's where I became a man,
let alone a baller.

40:49.199 --> 40:51.785
I mean, it's where I met Tonya.

40:52.995 --> 40:53.954
Naim.

40:53.954 --> 40:57.624
It's where my dad coached me.

40:57.624 --> 41:00.669
And no one's trying to
take that away from you, Coach.

41:00.669 --> 41:04.339
But you did say if I ever needed anything.

41:07.885 --> 41:09.052
You don't need me no more.

41:09.052 --> 41:12.598
Would you be willing to meet
with the Cedar Cove athletic director?

41:16.351 --> 41:17.769
Say yes. You owe us.

41:17.769 --> 41:19.313
I owe you?

41:19.313 --> 41:21.315
Okay. How do you figure?

41:21.315 --> 41:24.318
- Give me time. I'll figure it out.
- And you know she will.

41:26.653 --> 41:29.114
A place like that
don't want a guy like me.

41:29.615 --> 41:31.200
Let me worry about that.

41:33.535 --> 41:34.536
Is that a yes?

41:38.248 --> 41:41.460
Yeah, I'll have a meeting with the man.

41:41.460 --> 41:42.377
All right?

41:42.377 --> 41:43.629
- Yes.
- Okay.

42:03.732 --> 42:06.026
You must be the Dr. Athletic Director.

42:06.026 --> 42:08.862
And you're Coach Isaac Kennedy Edwards.

42:08.862 --> 42:11.657
Do we gotta keep it so formal?
Everybody calls me Ike.

42:12.157 --> 42:13.867
Informal's fine by me, Ike. Pleasure.

42:13.867 --> 42:15.994
<i>You've arrived at your destination.</i>

42:16.912 --> 42:18.121
Sorry. Sorry about that.

42:18.121 --> 42:19.915
You have trouble finding the place?

42:19.915 --> 42:21.291
Oh, no, it was fine.

42:21.291 --> 42:24.753
It's quite the architecture
y'all got around here.

42:24.753 --> 42:26.171
It's older than it looks.

42:26.922 --> 42:28.423
Been doing some recent remodeling.

42:28.423 --> 42:30.425
We're hatching a new science building
over there,

42:30.425 --> 42:32.761
and the main building for
the upper school's torn down

42:32.761 --> 42:36.014
to meet environmental standards.
We even have a garden on the roof.

42:36.014 --> 42:38.350
Match that rise in tuition.

42:39.518 --> 42:42.020
Well, it did pay
for the new athletic wing.

42:44.565 --> 42:45.649
- Come on.
- Okay.

42:49.820 --> 42:54.116
Our coaches usually come from
their own Ivy League backgrounds.

42:54.741 --> 42:58.287
Had some of our playbooks,
signed and bound.

42:58.287 --> 43:00.914
We've gotten some steam
from our football program,

43:00.914 --> 43:03.417
but it's really basketball
that put us on the map.

43:04.251 --> 43:07.045
Jace Carson graced the cover
of our newsletter

43:07.045 --> 43:08.881
after winning the state championship.

43:08.881 --> 43:11.300
But we don't let our students
slack on their studies,

43:11.300 --> 43:14.636
and provide some of the best tutors
to support them throughout the season.

43:14.636 --> 43:16.638
What is your Jace Carson plan?

43:19.141 --> 43:21.059
My Jace Carson plan?

43:21.560 --> 43:25.022
Well, you see, he has a long way to go
in a short amount of time.

43:25.022 --> 43:25.981
All due respect,

43:25.981 --> 43:28.650
I acquired inner-city kids
to win a state championship

43:29.359 --> 43:30.819
and buy into the Cedar Cove way.

43:30.819 --> 43:32.738
Don't underestimate
the impact that has had.

43:32.738 --> 43:34.281
The Cedar Cove way?

43:34.948 --> 43:37.451
Expect greatness, achieve greatness.

43:38.035 --> 43:41.997
Well, obviously we can agree that
these inner-city kids

43:43.123 --> 43:44.708
are not trophies.

43:44.708 --> 43:47.294
When we succeed,
on some level, we all are.

43:48.921 --> 43:50.130
Let's talk in my office.

44:07.481 --> 44:08.482
Vinyl?

44:09.233 --> 44:10.484
I'm a purist.

44:10.484 --> 44:11.568
Do you mind?

44:12.444 --> 44:13.278
Feel free.

44:18.033 --> 44:19.034
Come on.

44:20.285 --> 44:23.247
Now, I know the good doctor
don't have Chuck Brown up in here.

44:23.997 --> 44:25.958
Go-go music is the soul of the people.

44:29.503 --> 44:30.754
You mind?

44:30.754 --> 44:31.839
Please do.

44:54.945 --> 44:57.489
<i>Keep what you got
Until you get what you need, y'all</i>

45:03.412 --> 45:06.498
<i>You got to give a lot just to get
What you need sometimes, y'all</i>

45:11.044 --> 45:12.171
<i>Gimme the bridge now</i>

45:16.675 --> 45:19.928
<i>I feel like bustin' loose
Bustin' loose</i>

45:28.061 --> 45:31.648
So you was one of those
jack-of-all-trade athletes, huh?

45:32.816 --> 45:36.945
Tennis, baseball, lacrosse. I even swam.

45:37.988 --> 45:40.324
You don't see a brother
grace a swim meet quite enough.

45:41.783 --> 45:43.785
I like to defy all misconceptions.

45:44.703 --> 45:47.289
We're capable of setting out
whatever we wanna accomplish.

45:48.081 --> 45:49.833
Winning is just a frame of mind.

45:51.335 --> 45:52.794
Do you like to win, Ike?

45:54.046 --> 45:55.130
Very much.

45:55.130 --> 45:58.926
Well, we have something in common.
Let's get some fresh air.

46:00.719 --> 46:03.388
You have a very impressive list of
accomplishments on your résumé.

46:03.388 --> 46:08.477
I have to ask, what happened in college?
Noticed a lack of a degree.

46:12.523 --> 46:14.107
It's because I didn't get one.

46:14.650 --> 46:18.487
I took a personal leave from Georgetown
and got too busy going back and forth.

46:19.821 --> 46:21.448
Six credits from graduation.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.702
We care deeply about optics at Cedar Cove.

46:26.912 --> 46:30.374
Our coaches have to
set our standard for discipline

46:30.374 --> 46:32.793
and take academics as seriously
as our students.

46:33.293 --> 46:34.419
For the Ivy League playbook?

46:34.419 --> 46:35.504
Wouldn't hurt.

46:37.130 --> 46:39.424
If it was a nonstarter,
why'd you waste my time?

46:42.511 --> 46:46.139
I got a ton of emails
from parents whose kids you've coached.

46:46.139 --> 46:50.519
Jenna Carson was especially insistent
that you are the man for the job.

46:52.813 --> 46:53.814
Besides winning,

46:54.857 --> 46:56.483
how would you describe the job?

46:56.483 --> 47:01.071
Our head coach needs to be
a great role model and a great leader.

47:01.864 --> 47:04.533
Profanity's okay in the locker room,
but not on the court.

47:09.246 --> 47:14.501
And players, whether they play a lot
or hardly play at all,

47:15.127 --> 47:18.881
they must feel like they are
a true part of the team.

47:18.881 --> 47:21.341
It's important for people
to know their roles.

47:22.634 --> 47:25.012
I do that for my players,
not for the optics.

47:25.012 --> 47:26.930
You're very confident
in your personal playbook.

47:27.848 --> 47:29.766
They don't call us Swagger for nothing.

47:36.273 --> 47:37.357
There she is.

47:39.818 --> 47:41.570
- Mike, how are you?
- Good to see you.

47:41.570 --> 47:43.238
I am well. Well.

47:43.238 --> 47:45.991
Alonzo Powers,
meet Diane Harrison-Fitzpatrick.

47:45.991 --> 47:48.535
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you as well.

47:48.535 --> 47:49.953
- Please.
- Thank you.

47:58.462 --> 48:02.758
So I was just sitting here talking
with Mike about your many accomplishments

48:02.758 --> 48:04.468
over at Cedar Cove Prep.

48:05.594 --> 48:08.263
Mike is one of our
most trusted board members.

48:09.348 --> 48:11.517
He should be our press secretary.

48:14.770 --> 48:17.397
But we did, in fact, have a good year.

48:18.106 --> 48:19.983
- Yes.
- We doubled in donations.

48:19.983 --> 48:21.360
That's impressive.

48:22.361 --> 48:25.864
Well, how do you attest
for such a dramatic uptick?

48:26.740 --> 48:28.408
Our support team, really.

48:29.159 --> 48:31.703
As chairwoman of the board,
I get to work with people like Mike

48:31.703 --> 48:34.206
and amazing volunteers.

48:37.292 --> 48:39.795
I bet winning state last year didn't hurt,
did it?

48:41.004 --> 48:43.090
No, it absolutely did not hurt.

48:44.258 --> 48:47.970
So, I was wondering if you could
withstand another donation?

48:49.263 --> 48:51.348
What would that look like exactly?

48:51.932 --> 48:55.352
Well, I'm sure Mike told you that I work
with Gladiator sneakers, correct?

48:55.352 --> 48:57.104
That-- He did mention that.

48:57.604 --> 49:00.274
Well, we believe that
the development of youth athletes

49:01.024 --> 49:02.818
is of the utmost importance.

49:04.403 --> 49:07.823
So, we would love to outfit your entire
Cedar Cove Mustangs.

49:08.574 --> 49:12.578
Cross-country, water polo,
soccer, football, baseball...

49:12.578 --> 49:14.121
And basketball.

49:15.747 --> 49:17.165
Especially basketball.

49:17.165 --> 49:21.336
And you'd outfit our entire athletics
just because of one team?

49:21.336 --> 49:24.381
Oh, no, no.

49:24.381 --> 49:27.217
We'll outfit your entire athletics
because of one player.

49:28.802 --> 49:29.803
Jace Carson.

49:31.138 --> 49:32.181
He's that special.

49:33.265 --> 49:35.934
I sponsored his 15-year-old club team.

49:36.435 --> 49:40.355
He led that team to two championships
back-to-back.

49:40.355 --> 49:42.733
You think winning state
attracts donations?

49:44.193 --> 49:47.321
What do you think winning a high school
national championship would attract?

49:49.615 --> 49:52.367
Well, I hadn't considered that.

49:52.367 --> 49:54.328
- Perhaps you should.
- Yeah.

49:58.040 --> 50:01.126
How are you guys doing
with the coaching vacancy?

50:02.377 --> 50:03.462
<i>Hi, Diane.</i>

50:03.462 --> 50:05.005
Hope it's not too late.

50:05.631 --> 50:06.632
<i>Not at all.</i>

50:07.424 --> 50:10.010
I was wondering how the search
for head coach is going.

50:10.594 --> 50:12.137
<i>I have two strong candidates.</i>

50:12.137 --> 50:15.432
<i>Camden Ryder, NBA pedigree.
And Neil Wicks.</i>

50:15.432 --> 50:17.935
<i>Was head of Fieldston Academy in New York.</i>

50:17.935 --> 50:20.187
<i>Both understand the culture of Cedar Cove.</i>

50:21.813 --> 50:22.814
Thank you, Emory,

50:22.814 --> 50:27.528
but I'm gonna need you to take another
look at one of our other candidates.

50:42.292 --> 50:45.671
- Hello?
- Ike. Dr. Emory Lawson, Cedar Cove Prep.

50:46.338 --> 50:48.090
Hey, brother, listen, if--

50:48.090 --> 50:51.218
if something's missing out of that office,
I promise it wasn't me.

50:52.219 --> 50:55.472
I am calling to offer you
the position of Head Basketball Coach.

50:56.765 --> 50:57.891
Seriously?

50:57.891 --> 51:00.269
<i>Officially, Interim Head Coach.</i>

51:01.770 --> 51:02.771
Meaning what?

51:02.771 --> 51:04.022
It's just a formality.

51:04.022 --> 51:05.941
We are prepared to make you
an attractive offer,

51:05.941 --> 51:07.776
which includes housing and day care.

51:10.279 --> 51:12.990
I'm not gonna lie,
I wasn't expecting this.

51:12.990 --> 51:14.074
<i>There's a stipulation.</i>

51:14.074 --> 51:18.537
You will take classes, on your own time,
in pursuit of a degree.

51:18.537 --> 51:22.040
Oh, man, if I accept the job,
I could do that.

51:22.040 --> 51:24.960
I would need to pick
my own coaching staff.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.629
- <i>But you keep Coach Seymour.</i>
- <i>Who's Coach Seymour?</i>

51:27.629 --> 51:30.716
Seventy-two years old. He's been
on the coaching staff for 35 years.

51:30.716 --> 51:31.967
I won't need him.

51:31.967 --> 51:34.052
<i>He's harmless, and it's not negotiable.</i>

51:41.727 --> 51:44.396
Listen. Thank you
for the unexpected offer.

51:44.396 --> 51:46.190
<i>I'ma seriously think about it.</i>

51:50.944 --> 51:52.529
So, why'd you wanna meet me here?

51:54.573 --> 51:55.991
Sentimental, I guess.

51:59.953 --> 52:01.872
You getting old or soft, or both?

52:03.457 --> 52:06.835
I'm getting better and more
handsome by the day. I can't control that.

52:10.714 --> 52:11.715
So, how you feel?

52:15.010 --> 52:20.432
Man, half of the time,
I'm just as hyped as I am nervous.

52:22.518 --> 52:25.979
When we used to play here,
I taped this sign on my wall.

52:26.522 --> 52:30.275
It said, "NBA. Never be afraid."

52:32.694 --> 52:34.363
Been trying to remind myself of that.

52:35.447 --> 52:36.740
Doesn't always work though.

52:40.827 --> 52:43.288
King, it can't always work.

52:44.957 --> 52:48.919
You know? You don't think I get scared?

52:50.337 --> 52:52.923
I mean, do guys as handsome
as you get scared?

52:56.593 --> 52:57.594
Maybe...

53:00.264 --> 53:01.640
Maybe you should tell yourself...

53:04.393 --> 53:08.397
"Never be afraid to be afraid."

53:11.066 --> 53:12.651
"Never be afraid to be afraid."

53:15.320 --> 53:17.322
"NBATBA."

53:31.879 --> 53:34.590
My mom is tripping about
all this NIL stuff.

53:37.009 --> 53:40.762
I mean, you didn't have to deal with that
when you were coming up.

53:42.181 --> 53:45.434
No. I just had to worry about being broke.

53:54.443 --> 53:59.364
Man, I talked to
the athletic director at Cedar Cove.

54:00.157 --> 54:01.158
How'd that go?

54:02.326 --> 54:03.327
It was all right.

54:04.036 --> 54:06.496
I was walking into Seat Pleasant High
when he rang me.

54:07.289 --> 54:08.749
He offered me the job.

54:10.501 --> 54:14.630
So, that's why all the sentimentality.
To let me down easy.

54:14.630 --> 54:16.882
That word is gonna go out your vocabulary.

54:17.466 --> 54:19.176
- What word?
- "Easy."

54:20.427 --> 54:22.137
I ain't going easy on you one bit.

54:23.472 --> 54:24.473
What are you saying?

54:26.308 --> 54:27.309
I'ma take the job.

54:29.478 --> 54:32.773
You said you was on your way
to Seat Pleasant. Why switch it up?

54:32.773 --> 54:36.068
The other night,
I said you don't need me no more.

54:36.568 --> 54:37.819
Maybe I'm right.

54:38.737 --> 54:39.738
Might be wrong.

54:40.239 --> 54:45.285
But what I need is to help Jace Carson
cross that finish line.

54:47.162 --> 54:48.413
You good with that?

54:53.919 --> 54:58.507
The world ain't ready
for what's about to happen, are they?

54:59.967 --> 55:02.094
Not even close.

55:15.899 --> 55:17.276
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

55:25.409 --> 55:26.827
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

55:33.458 --> 55:35.127
No. You're going too far.

55:35.127 --> 55:36.086
You're gonna kill him.

55:37.254 --> 55:38.922
Let's go!
