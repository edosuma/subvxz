WEBVTT

00:08.367 --> 00:09.667
I'll be back
in a couple hours,

00:09.733 --> 00:11.233
by 9:00 at the latest.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.167
Are you sure
you're okay?

00:13.233 --> 00:14.800
Dad, we're fine.

00:14.867 --> 00:15.967
I'm 12!

00:16.033 --> 00:17.867
Kids babysit at 12.
Hello-o-o?

00:17.933 --> 00:19.467
You're not
babysitting me.

00:19.533 --> 00:20.767
I'm not a baby.

00:20.833 --> 00:22.133
Theoretically, I am.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.400
Are not!

00:23.467 --> 00:25.400
All right, I'm calling
Bill and Jackie to cancel.

00:25.467 --> 00:27.100
Clearly, you're not okay alone.

00:27.167 --> 00:28.167
We're fine!

00:28.233 --> 00:29.333
Of course we are.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.600
Sorry.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.167
But you're not babysitting me.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.567
Seriously?

00:33.633 --> 00:36.333
We're fine.
Siblings argue.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.967
It's what we do.

00:38.033 --> 00:41.267
You know, I'm happy
to pitch in

00:41.333 --> 00:43.400
with whatever's happening
over here.

00:43.467 --> 00:44.433
Nope. I'm buying
a present for Abuela.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.400
I'm getting her some fish.

00:46.467 --> 00:47.733
To eat?

00:47.800 --> 00:49.633
No, to keep.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.400
So she won't
be lonely.

00:51.467 --> 00:53.733
Abuela
is not lonely.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.300
Believe me.

00:55.367 --> 00:56.633
Mirabel...

00:56.700 --> 00:57.867
I'm just saying,

00:57.933 --> 01:00.467
plenty of fish
in the sea.

01:00.533 --> 01:03.267
20 bucks, from me.

01:04.767 --> 01:08.833
Wait... I just realized
I need 10 for tonight.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.333
There's 10.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.333
I'm leaving.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.367
Not like that, you aren't!

01:13.867 --> 01:15.800
Oh... these are the moments
I live for.

01:15.867 --> 01:16.800
Totes.

01:16.867 --> 01:18.067
Mirabel, go change.

01:18.067 --> 01:18.867
What's wrong
with what I'm wearing?

01:20.267 --> 01:21.633
Well, where should I start?

01:21.700 --> 01:23.733
I mean, first of all,
unless you're going swimming,

01:23.800 --> 01:26.300
you need to be wearing
more... fabric.

01:26.367 --> 01:27.367
Everywhere!

01:27.433 --> 01:29.700
You're not going
swimming, are you?

01:29.767 --> 01:31.500
No, I'm not.

01:31.567 --> 01:32.867
I'm going to the game.

01:32.933 --> 01:35.433
Ah, okay, yeah,
the plot thickens.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.367
Liam is pitching, I assume?

01:37.433 --> 01:38.367
He assumes
correctly.

01:38.433 --> 01:39.567
He does.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.867
Enough.

01:40.933 --> 01:42.433
And all my friends
dress like this.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.667
Well, that's great for them.

01:43.733 --> 01:45.200
You're not going
out of the house like that.

01:45.267 --> 01:46.300
Go change.

01:46.367 --> 01:47.833
-No!
-Excuse me?

01:47.900 --> 01:50.433
No. I am not going to change.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.533
I'm not
a kid, Dad.

01:51.600 --> 01:52.900
I can wear whatever I want.

01:52.967 --> 01:54.267
Ooh...

01:54.333 --> 01:58.067
No, Mirabel... you can't.

01:58.067 --> 02:01.700
You are 15 years old,
and you are very much a kid,

02:01.767 --> 02:03.967
and this outfit
is completely inappropriate!

02:04.067 --> 02:05.667
End of story!

02:05.733 --> 02:07.133
Not "end of story"!

02:07.200 --> 02:09.067
You don't understand!

02:09.067 --> 02:11.067
It's not fair!

02:11.067 --> 02:14.067
If Mom were here,
she'd understand!

02:14.133 --> 02:16.933
She'd let me
wear what I want to wear!

02:17.067 --> 02:19.067
She'd defend me!

02:20.933 --> 02:22.867
You don't get it!

02:22.933 --> 02:24.967
You never will.

02:27.067 --> 02:28.967
You're not Mom.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.667
You should have heard her.

03:04.733 --> 03:06.333
It was-- It was terrifying.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.333
I mean, she was screaming.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.533
Actually screaming.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.800
Oh, God. You know,
Mom used to scream, right?

03:11.867 --> 03:14.500
I hate screaming.

03:14.567 --> 03:16.900
Do you remember
the time that we borrowed--

03:16.967 --> 03:18.967
stole...
Mr. Angel's car

03:19.067 --> 03:20.367
from down the block?

03:20.433 --> 03:21.767
Right?
Oh-ho, man...

03:21.833 --> 03:24.633
did Mom scream
that day.

03:24.700 --> 03:25.967
What?

03:26.067 --> 03:28.533
There's a lot going on
for Mirabel right now.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.900
I mean,
she's in high school now,

03:29.967 --> 03:31.900
and all the pressures
that go with that.

03:31.967 --> 03:33.133
Her hormones are going nuts,

03:33.200 --> 03:35.633
and she doesn't
have a mother.

03:35.700 --> 03:36.933
She misses Isabella,

03:37.067 --> 03:39.733
and that's gonna come out
in all sorts of ways.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.567
No, but you guys
don't understand.

03:41.633 --> 03:43.467
She lost it.

03:43.533 --> 03:44.433
Yeah, just like Mom.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.733
Poor... Poor kid.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.067
She's a teenage girl.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.333
It's bound to happen.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.900
Really? Again?

03:53.967 --> 03:55.100
Many times.

03:55.167 --> 03:56.933
Teenage girls,
they scream, slam doors,

03:57.067 --> 03:58.067
say "I hate you!"

03:58.100 --> 03:59.700
I know,

03:59.767 --> 04:01.100
I was one of them.
It's awful.

04:01.167 --> 04:03.433
You need a Scotch.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.133
Yeah.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.900
I don't know, I mean,
maybe she's right.

04:07.967 --> 04:09.167
Maybe I need
to chill out,

04:09.233 --> 04:10.533
stop being so...

04:10.600 --> 04:11.633
Fatherly?

04:11.700 --> 04:14.267
I know. It's my job,

04:14.333 --> 04:16.900
but, you know, she kept saying,
"You don't understand!"

04:16.967 --> 04:18.767
and "You don't get it!"

04:18.833 --> 04:20.167
Maybe she's right!

04:20.233 --> 04:21.533
I don't know what it's like
to be a 15-year-old girl

04:21.600 --> 04:22.567
without a mother.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.633
And you never
will, Rick!

04:24.700 --> 04:25.933
You're never
gonna be her!

04:26.067 --> 04:29.667
But the point is,
you're doing the best you can.

04:29.733 --> 04:32.733
Maybe I should
let her grow up, you know...

04:32.800 --> 04:34.567
get a little more independence.

04:34.633 --> 04:37.133
Maybe she's not a kid anymore.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.433
Sh i a kid, Ricky,
but you called her a kid.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.967
And teenagers, they don't
want to be called a kid.

04:44.067 --> 04:44.867
Mm.

04:44.933 --> 04:46.600
That was better, right?

04:46.667 --> 04:47.900
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.

04:47.967 --> 04:49.600
Most teenage girls
can't wait to grow up

04:49.667 --> 04:50.800
and be taken seriously.

04:50.867 --> 04:53.633
And Mirabel, she just
wants to be a grown-up,

04:53.700 --> 04:55.633
and she wants you
to treat her like one.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.800
You remember
what it was like...

04:57.867 --> 04:59.567
Being the little brother,

04:59.633 --> 05:01.933
trying to hang out
with me and my friends?

05:02.067 --> 05:04.533
Trying to get into
the movies with us?

05:04.600 --> 05:07.700
Wondering when the heck
you were actually gonna grow up?

05:07.767 --> 05:10.167
I do. Absolutely.

05:10.233 --> 05:12.933
And I'm still not
talking to Andy Stern.

05:13.067 --> 05:16.533
I mean, who wanted to go to
his stupid Bar Mitzvah anyway?

05:16.600 --> 05:19.467
But Mirabel,
she's the oldest.

05:19.533 --> 05:20.900
Exactly.

05:20.967 --> 05:23.533
And that's why she feels like
you've demeaned her.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.633
But I got
to tell you.

05:26.700 --> 05:31.267
Andy Stern's Bar Mitzvah...
off the charts!

05:31.333 --> 05:33.133
Was...
...a lot of fun.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.200
Whatever, Bill.

05:37.967 --> 05:39.300
I didn't mean
to make her feel bad.

05:39.367 --> 05:40.933
At all.
It was just...

05:41.067 --> 05:42.767
You know, when I saw her
in that outfit

05:42.833 --> 05:45.067
and I started thinking about
boys seeing her in that--

05:45.133 --> 05:47.933
Oh, no, I know
exactly what you mean!

05:48.067 --> 05:49.833
I couldn't handle
that for a minute!

05:49.900 --> 05:50.900
I mean, you know what?

05:50.967 --> 05:53.067
I go crazy
even if I know

05:53.067 --> 05:54.900
someone's looking
at my niece!

05:54.967 --> 05:55.967
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:56.067 --> 05:56.900
I just want
to grab them by--

05:56.967 --> 05:57.933
Oh, my God!

05:58.067 --> 05:59.500
Guys, please!

05:59.567 --> 06:00.900
-What?
-Hold on. I lost it, too.

06:00.967 --> 06:02.200
I don't want her wearing
something like that,

06:02.267 --> 06:03.700
and that's
my prerogative!

06:03.767 --> 06:04.900
I mean, I'm her
parent, right?

06:04.967 --> 06:06.200
Oh, exactly!
Oh, and boys?

06:06.267 --> 06:09.067
No, no, no.
Not even one.

06:09.067 --> 06:11.133
No! Never. Never, ever!

06:11.200 --> 06:13.967
Uncle Bill putting
his foot down, right now!

06:14.067 --> 06:16.367
Of course,
you are the parent,

06:16.433 --> 06:18.400
but there's ways
to go about it. Right?

06:18.467 --> 06:20.800
It's like telling somebody
to calm down--

06:20.867 --> 06:24.200
never calms them down, right?

06:26.067 --> 06:28.933
Ah, I'm glad
I have you guys and Rosa.

06:29.067 --> 06:31.333
I can't do this alone.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.833
You know, and sometimes,
I just get so...

06:34.900 --> 06:37.733
you know, mad at Isabella
for...

06:37.800 --> 06:41.133
dying, and...

06:41.200 --> 06:43.867
leaving me alone.

06:51.633 --> 06:53.300
What, uh...

06:53.367 --> 06:56.067
what's happening
over-- over here?

06:56.067 --> 06:59.300
Um...

06:59.367 --> 07:02.900
Looks like "fancy"
is happening here.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.300
There's room
at the counter, girls.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.100
Thanks.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.867
You went about it
all wrong, Mirabel.

07:26.933 --> 07:30.167
I change in the locker room
once I get to school.

07:30.233 --> 07:33.267
I leave the house looking
as Amish as possible.

07:33.333 --> 07:36.100
If I owned a bonnet,
I'd wear it.

07:36.167 --> 07:38.733
Yeah, but I don't want to lie
to my dad, Julie.

07:40.533 --> 07:44.067
You guys should have heard him.
He lost it.

07:44.067 --> 07:45.367
I know what
that's like,

07:45.433 --> 07:48.367
but, Mira,
it's not lying.

07:48.433 --> 07:50.133
It's withholding.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.300
Different!

07:51.367 --> 07:52.933
Oh...

07:53.067 --> 07:55.233
I wish my dad cared
about what I was wearing.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.133
I honestly don't even think
he knows what I look like.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.767
That sucks, Elaine.

08:00.833 --> 08:03.600
Sorry.
My dad's great.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.400
It's just he...

08:05.467 --> 08:07.833
doesn't get it.

08:07.900 --> 08:12.667
And... you know,
he's a guy.

08:13.833 --> 08:15.167
I'm sorry,
Mirabel.

08:15.233 --> 08:18.333
It must be so hard.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.267
I don't know
about you guys,

08:23.333 --> 08:26.233
but I'm glad that
we left when we did,

08:26.300 --> 08:28.133
because I could not
take another inning.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.800
So boring.

08:29.867 --> 08:31.233
Totally.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.267
We're here
'cause of you.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.633
'Cause of Liam.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.100
Whoo!

08:40.233 --> 08:43.067
There they are!

08:43.133 --> 08:44.433
I'm just going to go talk
to the girls for a sec.

08:45.967 --> 08:47.067
Hey.

08:47.067 --> 08:49.167
Hey. I was just
telling Elaine and Julie

08:49.233 --> 08:50.300
how amazing
the game was.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.367
Yeah.

08:51.433 --> 08:54.267
Really?
'Cause you left.

08:55.367 --> 08:56.367
Um...

08:58.067 --> 09:00.767
That's okay.
I would've left, too.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.133
It sucked.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.333
There's a woman coming here,
isn't there?

09:07.400 --> 09:10.167
A woman coming for dinner
for the widowed brother.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.833
You're ambush-dating me!

09:11.900 --> 09:13.433
No, no, no. It's--
It's not like that.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.233
Oh! Oh, no.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.067
But Billy,
it looks like that.

09:17.067 --> 09:19.100
Calm down. Oh--!

09:19.167 --> 09:21.167
Oh...
"calm down", is it?

09:21.233 --> 09:22.867
Well, I thought
that didn't work.

09:22.933 --> 09:24.300
Turns out, it doesn't.

09:24.367 --> 09:25.533
I'm leaving.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.067
And not
at all calmly.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.433
Okay, look.
Look, Rick.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.533
I get it, I do.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.133
You made it very clear
that we were

09:33.200 --> 09:35.167
to butt out
on your dating.

09:35.233 --> 09:38.200
And yet, here we are
with Mom's china and candles.

09:38.267 --> 09:39.300
Imagine that!

09:39.367 --> 09:40.900
It's just
we couldn't

09:40.967 --> 09:41.933
help ourselves.

09:42.067 --> 09:44.167
Yeah. She's
incredibly cool,

09:44.233 --> 09:45.867
and this is going to be
totally casual.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.333
I won't even
light the candles.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.833
Really?

09:49.900 --> 09:51.833
You won't even
light the candles?

09:51.900 --> 09:53.567
It just slipped
out. Sorry.

09:53.633 --> 09:56.467
Look, this will be
totally casual, bro.

09:56.533 --> 09:59.167
I made rack of lamb
with wine, Bordeaux,

09:59.233 --> 10:00.833
and chanterelle reduction,

10:00.900 --> 10:03.167
and red quinoa
with almonds and shallots.

10:03.233 --> 10:05.900
A light arugula salad
with some shaved parm,

10:05.967 --> 10:07.933
and chocolate ganache
for dessert.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.333
No biggie.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.433
Not helping.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.200
Is that all?
Is that all?

10:12.267 --> 10:14.067
Sounds like a real casual meal,

10:14.133 --> 10:16.367
with
the Bordeaux wine reduction.

10:16.433 --> 10:17.867
Okay, listen to me.

10:17.933 --> 10:19.500
Lindsay is just--

10:19.567 --> 10:20.967
Oh! Lindsay, is it?

10:21.033 --> 10:22.333
The ambush-date has a name.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.200
"Lindsay."

10:24.267 --> 10:26.833
Okay, she happens
to be smart and sexy.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.200
She is also
an orthopedic surgeon.

10:28.267 --> 10:30.600
Yeah, she's done

10:30.667 --> 10:33.033
Tommy John-type surgeries,
like you had on your elbow.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.367
Many times.
What do you think about that?

10:34.433 --> 10:35.867
Is that not cool?

10:35.933 --> 10:37.033
Totally cool!

10:40.267 --> 10:41.200
I don't want
you to think

10:41.267 --> 10:42.333
that we arranged
anything,

10:42.400 --> 10:44.300
or that
we ambushed you.

10:44.367 --> 10:47.233
Oh, oh, no, it doesn't
look like that at all.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.800
We just thought
that it would be fun

10:48.867 --> 10:49.867
to have dinner
together.

10:49.933 --> 10:50.900
Just dinner.

10:50.967 --> 10:51.833
If you guys
dig each other,

10:51.900 --> 10:52.867
you dig each other,

10:52.933 --> 10:54.200
if not, not. Right?

10:54.267 --> 10:56.433
Don't even think
of it as a date.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.867
Just think of it as a...

10:59.500 --> 11:01.500
...A chance encounter.

11:04.433 --> 11:07.100
A chance encounter?

11:08.467 --> 11:11.200
In your dining room?

11:11.267 --> 11:13.367
Dug deep for
that one, hey, babe?

11:13.433 --> 11:15.067
Kinda did.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.067
Yep.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.833
I'll get it.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.533
Trust me.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.467
-Really?
-Trust me.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.067
Pow!

11:26.467 --> 11:28.800
I don't think
we should be in here.

11:28.867 --> 11:31.200
Well, not in
her closet, anyway.

11:31.267 --> 11:32.800
She won't know.

11:32.867 --> 11:34.833
She knows
everything!

11:40.833 --> 11:43.567
Step away
from the garments.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.200
Oh, look! Teddy.

11:46.267 --> 11:48.467
Don't touch anything!

11:48.533 --> 11:49.933
That's the key.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.367
Look how hot
all of these are.

11:55.433 --> 11:57.567
Yes, I think "hot"
was the inherent problem

11:57.633 --> 12:00.300
with Dad's thesis
earlier this evening.

12:00.367 --> 12:03.200
But they're all
so pretty.

12:03.267 --> 12:05.533
All my clothes
are so boyish.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.267
Look at
that frilly thing!

12:07.333 --> 12:09.567
It's so girlie.

12:09.633 --> 12:10.833
I want to be girlie.

12:10.900 --> 12:11.867
No, you don't.

12:11.933 --> 12:12.967
Now let's
get out of here.

12:13.067 --> 12:15.167
I kinda do.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.233
You've got
a different style.

12:17.300 --> 12:20.200
Stick with it.
It works on you.

12:20.267 --> 12:22.267
Style?
I have no style.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.967
See? No style.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.333
A fashion desert.

12:28.067 --> 12:29.433
And sports equipment.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.533
That's nice.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.133
It looks okay to me.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.533
Corduroy pants?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.267
And not the narrow corduroys.

12:35.333 --> 12:37.233
The thick, weird ones!

12:37.300 --> 12:38.300
Not good.

12:40.133 --> 12:41.233
Most alarming--

12:41.300 --> 12:42.433
Blue cupcake t-shirt, 12:00.

12:43.967 --> 12:46.067
Yeah, that's bad.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.967
We're gonna have
a yard sale,

12:50.067 --> 12:51.400
sell all
this old stuff,

12:51.467 --> 12:53.567
and I'm gonna chip in
for Abuela's gift.

12:53.633 --> 12:55.467
We're going
for the whole aquarium!

12:57.333 --> 13:00.533
And then,
I'm going shopping.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.700
Oh... "Ducky" jacket.

13:03.767 --> 13:05.433
Oh, and it has a...
It has a beak, even.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.400
On its hood.

13:06.467 --> 13:07.533
Quack-quack.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.733
Quack-quack.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.567
But if I'm being
honest, I admit,

13:10.633 --> 13:12.667
I want my girls
to stay kids forever.

13:12.733 --> 13:16.067
You sound like
a very loving father.

13:16.133 --> 13:18.533
No, it can be tough,
this parenting thing.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.300
You know what
can be really tough?

13:20.367 --> 13:23.067
Pro-ball.
Tell her about it.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.100
You know, when you first bring
'em home from the hospital,

13:25.167 --> 13:26.233
it's terrifying.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.667
I mean, they're so small
and helpless,

13:28.733 --> 13:30.167
and you're clueless
and scared,

13:30.233 --> 13:32.400
and then, all of a sudden,
one day, it just... clicks.

13:32.467 --> 13:35.500
Just like that?
It just clicks?

13:35.567 --> 13:37.333
I don't buy it.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.233
No, it does.
It's wild.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.533
I mean, what you feel
for this kid in your arms?

13:42.600 --> 13:46.200
It's the most profound love
you can imagine.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.600
No, I-I really can't.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.367
I just--

13:52.433 --> 13:53.933
I don't think,
unless you have kids,

13:54.067 --> 13:55.267
that you get it.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.633
I think
you're right, Lindsay.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.633
I love my nieces,

13:58.700 --> 14:02.200
but as a woman without kids...
I know what you mean.

14:02.267 --> 14:04.433
Would anyone
like any cheese?

14:04.500 --> 14:05.800
Olive tapenade?

14:05.867 --> 14:09.133
To talk about
anything but this?

14:09.200 --> 14:11.400
No, and when
they're little kids,

14:11.467 --> 14:14.833
you get this truly
unconditional love from them.

14:14.900 --> 14:17.133
They're like puppies,
but better.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.133
I mean, no,
you can do no wrong.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.833
They're mushy and sweet
and they smell good,

14:21.900 --> 14:26.133
and one day, it's...
it's not about you.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.267
That's the thing.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.067
It's never gonna be
about you again,

14:29.100 --> 14:31.067
and you know what?

14:31.133 --> 14:33.067
It's the best feeling ever!

14:33.133 --> 14:34.767
You become...

14:34.833 --> 14:37.267
selfless
when you're a parent.

14:39.367 --> 14:42.433
If... If you're a good parent.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.267
Agreed.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.100
Yeah, you know,
I know a woman

14:46.167 --> 14:48.633
who tried to sell her kids
on eBay.

14:52.267 --> 14:53.633
Okay, that didn't go over
really well,

14:53.700 --> 14:55.733
but, talking about long shots,

14:55.800 --> 14:58.467
have you seen this man
throw a ball?

15:01.233 --> 15:02.633
Let's switch gears here.
How about dinner?

15:02.700 --> 15:03.933
Jacquelyn,

15:04.067 --> 15:06.133
would you join me in the kitchen
for just a moment?

15:06.200 --> 15:09.133
I would love to,
William!

15:13.700 --> 15:15.633
You have issues!

15:15.700 --> 15:18.200
He's talking about his kids!

15:18.267 --> 15:21.500
About parenting
and "profound love"!

15:21.567 --> 15:23.633
Yuck So not sexy.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.333
They're having
an adult conversation.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.600
Why does it have to be sexy?

15:27.667 --> 15:29.100
It just doesn't feel like
a first date.

15:29.167 --> 15:30.067
'Cause it's really not!

15:30.133 --> 15:31.567
And we're here,

15:31.633 --> 15:33.333
and Ricky just had a fight
with Mirabel,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.633
and what do you know
about first dates anyway?

15:35.700 --> 15:37.267
You haven't had a first date
in 15 years!

15:37.333 --> 15:40.267
And what is so "yuck"
about profound love?

15:40.333 --> 15:41.767
I don't know.
I just...

15:41.833 --> 15:43.700
I don't see sparks.

15:43.767 --> 15:45.367
Oh, my God!

15:45.433 --> 15:47.600
You make so mad right now!

15:47.667 --> 15:49.100
You don't see sparks,
you feel them--

15:49.167 --> 15:51.200
and not in other people!

15:51.267 --> 15:53.533
Get the lamb.
You're annoying me.

15:58.767 --> 16:01.867
He's so funny.
I love my husband.

16:03.467 --> 16:04.700
What about
these overalls?

16:04.767 --> 16:05.767
Overalls?

16:07.333 --> 16:08.867
What am I, a farmer?

16:08.933 --> 16:10.200
What was I thinking?

16:11.800 --> 16:14.733
I'm getting rid
of everything.

16:18.667 --> 16:19.700
No way.

16:19.767 --> 16:22.500
Yep, you own
this bunny bad-boy.

16:22.567 --> 16:23.833
I should be arrested.

16:29.833 --> 16:31.733
It just keeps getting worse.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.167
I think I need
to seek professional help.

16:35.367 --> 16:37.567
Often, doing something cathartic
like this

16:37.633 --> 16:38.733
is freeing in a way.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.467
Once you dissect
the elements

16:40.533 --> 16:41.700
of something
that is bothering you,

16:41.767 --> 16:43.633
whether it be a trauma,

16:43.700 --> 16:45.433
or a pair of
hideous plaid shorts,

16:45.500 --> 16:47.367
you're able to move on
from this crisis point

16:47.433 --> 16:48.733
and start anew.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.800
Wow. Just wow.

16:50.867 --> 16:52.233
You rock, Gigi.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.100
You rock some weird stuff
for a eight-year-old to spew,

16:54.167 --> 16:55.267
but you rock.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.300
Elisa? Gigi?

16:58.367 --> 16:59.700
Oh, no, Abuela.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.333
Act casual, say nothing.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.300
She's too smart for that!

17:02.367 --> 17:04.300
Okay...

17:04.367 --> 17:06.233
then just don't
mention the fish.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.400
Coming!

17:18.333 --> 17:21.700
So, I know you two
are here alone,

17:21.767 --> 17:22.867
which I don't love,

17:22.933 --> 17:24.333
but I am trying
to let your father

17:24.400 --> 17:25.633
parent without me,

17:25.700 --> 17:26.867
which I also don't love.

17:28.333 --> 17:29.533
Have you had dinner yet?

17:29.600 --> 17:30.733
Elisa made chicken,

17:30.800 --> 17:32.067
but we haven't
had it yet.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.667
We've been going through
my closet.

17:33.733 --> 17:35.567
I hate all my clothes Abuela.

17:35.633 --> 17:37.333
I want to change my look.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.467
Well, it's about time.

17:38.533 --> 17:41.467
I-I mean that,
when you get older,

17:41.533 --> 17:44.333
you pay more attention
to how you look.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.567
For boys?

17:45.633 --> 17:47.400
Ah! Boys are an afterthought.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.967
You get dressed
to feel good about yourself.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.267
I'm selling my old clothes.

17:51.333 --> 17:52.633
Gigi and I are going
to have a garage sale.

17:54.067 --> 17:55.833
Oh! That's great!
I love garage sales!

17:55.900 --> 17:57.433
And I have so much stuff
to get rid of.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.767
That's okay.

17:58.833 --> 18:01.067
It's just gonna be me and Gigi,
by ourselves.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.833
We want to do it alone.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.433
But I have so much
to donate.

18:06.867 --> 18:08.633
I'll tell you what--

18:08.700 --> 18:11.467
sell the stuff
and keep the money.

18:12.533 --> 18:14.067
It's kind of our thing.

18:16.767 --> 18:18.933
So you don't want my help?

18:20.067 --> 18:21.300
Next time, maybe.

18:21.367 --> 18:24.600
Hmm. I move out,

18:24.667 --> 18:26.333
a few months later,
I don't exist.

18:29.667 --> 18:30.467
Hey.

18:30.533 --> 18:31.400
Hey!

18:31.467 --> 18:32.567
Join us.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.667
How was the game?

18:36.467 --> 18:37.633
Mirabel?

18:40.500 --> 18:42.767
I'm going to bed.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.433
She and Dad had a fight.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.400
A big one.

18:50.467 --> 18:52.067
He told her to change
what she was wearing,

18:52.067 --> 18:53.300
because...

18:53.367 --> 18:55.667
it wasn't
a lot of clothing at all.

18:55.733 --> 18:57.500
Like, almost none.

18:57.567 --> 18:58.767
Her stomach was showing.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.100
Oh, boy...

19:00.167 --> 19:01.900
And then he called her a kid

19:01.967 --> 19:03.433
and she yelled
that he wasn't Mom,

19:03.500 --> 19:04.633
and then
she slammed the door.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.500
Okay...

19:06.567 --> 19:07.933
Eat your tamales.

19:08.067 --> 19:09.567
I'm on it.

19:13.933 --> 19:15.933
Mirabel?

19:17.600 --> 19:19.067
She so deserves fish.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.600
She's the best.

19:25.167 --> 19:28.067
Mm. Yeah. Yeah.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.067
Okay, yeah, no...
grip.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.167
Grip? Like that?

19:31.233 --> 19:32.900
Yeah. And pulse it.

19:32.967 --> 19:34.067
I'm pulsing,
I'm pulsing, I'm pulsing.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.267
Oh, that's--
no, that's good.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.200
And side to side
a little bit, like a--

19:37.267 --> 19:38.633
Oh! Did you
feel that?

19:38.700 --> 19:40.567
I do! I mean...

19:40.633 --> 19:42.067
Ahem.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.700
Dessert time.

19:43.767 --> 19:47.733
Oh, you were right, Bill,
she is cool.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.867
I was right?
I was right!

19:50.933 --> 19:52.233
Would you mind
saying that again,

19:52.300 --> 19:54.933
little brother, so I can
get that recorded?

19:55.067 --> 19:56.167
Put the phone down, Bill.

19:56.233 --> 19:57.533
You were right.
I got it.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.767
No recording necessary.

20:03.967 --> 20:05.833
Mirabel?

20:05.900 --> 20:06.933
Hi.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.767
Hi.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.067
Can we talk?

20:12.133 --> 20:14.967
I'm not up
for it, Abuela.

20:15.033 --> 20:17.567
Here... Let me.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.767
Dad and I had a fight.

20:23.833 --> 20:26.033
So I heard.
I'm so sorry.

20:28.167 --> 20:30.133
But no father

20:30.200 --> 20:31.867
wants to see
his daughter

20:31.933 --> 20:34.933
start to look
like a woman.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.700
Why?

20:36.767 --> 20:39.533
Because he was
once a boy.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.067
I'm genuinely
concerned about Liam,

20:43.133 --> 20:46.000
if you and he start
to get serious... oh.

20:46.067 --> 20:48.700
Your father
can wield a bat!

20:48.767 --> 20:49.667
Whomp!

20:51.733 --> 20:53.933
Oh, dear!

20:54.000 --> 20:59.567
He was just so "Dad"
about the whole thing.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.600
My outfit was so cute.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.700
Oh, I'm sure it was,

21:03.767 --> 21:05.900
but he is your father.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.067
And you're in such
an exciting time

21:09.067 --> 21:11.533
in your life, Mirabel.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.833
You gotta
have fun with it.

21:13.900 --> 21:17.067
I remember those days.

21:17.133 --> 21:18.633
You do?

21:18.700 --> 21:20.700
Mm-hmm.

21:20.767 --> 21:23.967
I also remember
feeling a little sad.

21:24.067 --> 21:26.200
that I could feel
myself changing.

21:26.267 --> 21:28.900
You're...

21:28.967 --> 21:31.800
You're saying goodbye

21:31.867 --> 21:34.300
to that "little girl"
side of yourself.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.533
Yeah.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.733
Yeah.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.233
I really got mad at Papi.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.767
I yelled.

21:46.100 --> 21:49.900
Well, sometimes, yelling
is better than being quiet.

21:49.967 --> 21:51.667
Never keep
something inside

21:51.733 --> 21:53.933
that you really
need to get out.

21:55.867 --> 21:57.733
I love you, Abuela.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.900
Oh. Love you, too.

22:02.367 --> 22:04.067
Everything's gonna be
all right, pumpkin.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.800
You'll see.

22:10.567 --> 22:13.067
The truncated range of motion in
Ricky's arm

22:13.067 --> 22:15.600
clearly illustrates
olecranon injury

22:15.667 --> 22:16.800
and tendon scarring.

22:16.867 --> 22:17.833
That's...

22:17.900 --> 22:19.667
a career-ender for sure.

22:19.733 --> 22:20.867
She's good.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.733
But I'm guessing it's not
just baseball-type overuse

22:24.800 --> 22:26.600
and rotational stress.

22:26.667 --> 22:28.067
There's an impact injury
there, right?

22:28.067 --> 22:30.300
There's bone fracture
and repair.

22:30.367 --> 22:31.833
Am I right?

22:31.900 --> 22:33.767
Yeah.

22:33.833 --> 22:36.067
Mirabel was only one.

22:36.933 --> 22:40.067
I was, uh, going to put her down
for her nap.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.933
She's asleep.

22:51.667 --> 22:53.667
Can you put her
in the crib?

22:53.733 --> 22:54.967
I'll be right
over there.

23:01.767 --> 23:03.633
Ahh!

23:07.867 --> 23:10.067
Oh! Honey, honey, honey.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.667
She's okay.
She's okay.

23:14.733 --> 23:16.433
Oh, little thing.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.067
You okay?

23:19.100 --> 23:21.067
Honey?

23:21.067 --> 23:22.967
I'm all right.

23:24.100 --> 23:24.967
-Hey...
-You okay?

23:26.667 --> 23:29.067
Uh... the elbow was wrecked.

23:29.067 --> 23:30.833
I never got it back.

23:30.900 --> 23:33.700
But Mirabel was okay.

23:33.767 --> 23:36.467
And that's--
that's all that mattered.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.067
Mirabel?

24:01.433 --> 24:03.600
Mirabel?

24:07.600 --> 24:09.900
I love you.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.533
Come on, Daddy. Please!

24:23.600 --> 24:25.067
It's snowing!

24:25.100 --> 24:26.800
But it's my Christmas present.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.500
Okay. You win.
Here we go!

24:30.567 --> 24:33.600
Don't let go, Dad!

24:35.533 --> 24:36.600
You're doing it!

24:48.067 --> 24:50.100
I did it!
Mom, Dad, I did it!

24:50.167 --> 24:51.767
Way to go, honey.

24:51.833 --> 24:53.467
All by yourself!

24:53.533 --> 24:55.867
You're a big girl now.

25:09.067 --> 25:10.500
Goodnight.

25:12.700 --> 25:15.800
Should I be concerned
about being fashion-senseless?

25:17.233 --> 25:20.167
Elisa, you are not
fashion-senseless.

25:20.233 --> 25:22.933
You have a confidence
that transcends clothes,

25:23.067 --> 25:24.600
but, if you like,

25:24.667 --> 25:26.700
Rosa can take you shopping
for some new stuff.

25:26.767 --> 25:28.467
Until then, if you see me
leaving the house

25:28.533 --> 25:29.533
in anything corduroy,

25:29.600 --> 25:30.533
you have to stop me.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.067
I promise.

25:32.067 --> 25:33.967
Love you, Dad.

25:34.067 --> 25:36.467
I love you, too.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.667
We looked online

25:43.733 --> 25:45.167
and we can get
an aquarium with fish

25:45.233 --> 25:46.833
for $65.

25:46.900 --> 25:50.100
Does Rosa want fish
and an aquarium?

25:50.167 --> 25:52.600
Who wouldn't want
fish and an aquarium?

25:52.667 --> 25:54.567
Duh.

25:54.633 --> 25:56.500
Daddy?

25:56.567 --> 25:59.067
I like being a kid.

25:59.133 --> 26:01.967
Are you trying
to melt my heart, Gigi?

26:02.067 --> 26:04.900
Because you're
doing a good job.

26:12.133 --> 26:15.533
Ahh, I didn't sleep
a wink last night.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.200
You look great
regardless.

26:17.267 --> 26:19.100
It's my thing.
It's what I do.

26:19.167 --> 26:21.500
I had a thing
with, uh, Mirabel.

26:21.567 --> 26:22.800
I know all about it.

26:22.867 --> 26:24.100
I spoke to her.

26:24.167 --> 26:25.100
I-Is she okay?

26:25.167 --> 26:26.733
It was pretty bad.

26:26.800 --> 26:27.800
I'm making
her favorite breakfast

26:27.867 --> 26:28.833
to make up for it.

26:28.900 --> 26:30.233
She is growing up,

26:30.300 --> 26:32.167
and you have got to let her.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.800
It felt good
talking to her.

26:35.867 --> 26:36.867
She needs you.

26:36.933 --> 26:38.600
And I need her.

26:38.667 --> 26:40.067
The other two could care less.

26:40.067 --> 26:41.667
What are you talking about?

26:41.733 --> 26:43.200
They live for you!

26:43.267 --> 26:44.833
They used to,
but not anymore.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.633
I never should have
moved out.

26:47.767 --> 26:50.067
Do I get
an "I told you so?"

26:50.067 --> 26:52.433
Or do I just have
to commiserate in silence?

26:52.500 --> 26:53.933
It's like I'm invisible.

26:54.067 --> 26:55.600
Wait. W-What are you
basing this on?

26:55.667 --> 26:58.200
They're having
a garage sale without me.

26:58.267 --> 27:00.300
They weren't very nice about it.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.167
This isn't funny!

27:03.233 --> 27:05.367
I offered
to help them,

27:05.433 --> 27:08.067
and they said no,
they would like to do it alone.

27:08.067 --> 27:11.067
Their eyes were very cold.

27:11.133 --> 27:13.100
I'm sure there were
no cold eyes, Rosa.

27:13.167 --> 27:15.200
They want to do the garage sale
by themselves because they--

27:15.267 --> 27:16.633
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Abuela.

27:16.700 --> 27:17.933
Did everybody sleep okay?

27:18.067 --> 27:19.600
It's important to get
at least seven hours.

27:19.667 --> 27:20.767
Eight is preferred.

27:21.867 --> 27:22.733
Hey there, sunshine.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.167
Hello.

27:24.233 --> 27:25.800
I had a dream last night
all my clothes were plaid.

27:25.867 --> 27:27.500
Shirt, socks,

27:27.567 --> 27:30.067
shorts, shoes...

27:30.067 --> 27:31.900
Everything!

27:31.967 --> 27:34.667
People screamed
when they looked at me.

27:36.367 --> 27:38.233
Wow, Daddy, this looks amazing.

27:38.300 --> 27:40.233
I made Mirabel's favorite.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.800
She's not here.

27:41.867 --> 27:43.400
What are you talking about?

27:43.467 --> 27:45.600
She left early this morning
to meet Elaine and Julie.

27:45.667 --> 27:46.667
They're going shopping.

27:47.833 --> 27:48.967
Okay.

27:49.067 --> 27:51.100
Kids, Ricky, let's eat.

27:51.167 --> 27:52.667
-Okay?

27:52.733 --> 27:54.567
She's fine.
She's shopping.

27:54.633 --> 27:56.667
It calms her down.

27:56.733 --> 27:57.933
It's true.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.333
Different activities
help different people relax.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.367
Shopping can be
a Zen-like experience

28:01.433 --> 28:02.900
for someone
like Mirabel.

28:02.967 --> 28:04.067
She finds comfort
in the routine

28:04.100 --> 28:05.933
and diversion
in the act itself.

28:06.067 --> 28:08.067
That's a lot for
a Saturday morning hija.

28:08.067 --> 28:09.500
Oh...

28:09.567 --> 28:11.833
I'm gonna text her and tell her
to meet me at the gym.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.367
Don't be disappointed
if she refuses.

28:14.700 --> 28:16.700
I'll bribe her.

28:17.933 --> 28:19.300
I'm not proud.

28:19.367 --> 28:20.767
Ahem.

28:23.867 --> 28:24.800
Hi...

28:24.867 --> 28:25.900
Hi.

28:25.967 --> 28:26.900
-...Alan.
-Yes?

28:26.967 --> 28:28.233
Uh, we spoke on
the phone. Lindsay.

28:28.300 --> 28:30.167
Oh, Lindsay! L--
Oh, this morning. Yes.

28:30.233 --> 28:32.333
And then again,
right, okay. Uh...

28:32.400 --> 28:33.900
Uh, for Ricky.

28:33.967 --> 28:34.900
Mm-hmm.

28:34.967 --> 28:36.067
He's just in his office

28:36.067 --> 28:37.633
and I'll let him
know you're here.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.300
You got
really nice eyes.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.800
Oh, no.
There's the hole.

28:43.867 --> 28:45.667
Oh. You know,
I remember ninth grade.

28:45.733 --> 28:47.900
I used to dress
it up pretty good.

28:47.967 --> 28:49.667
"If you got it,
flaunt it" kind of thing.

28:49.733 --> 28:52.333
In retrospect,
not my best year.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.733
Here. I'll show you.

28:59.233 --> 29:02.167
Oh. Whoa! Whoa. Yup.
Not your best moment.

29:02.233 --> 29:05.067
Why is there a brick
next to your ear?

29:05.133 --> 29:06.233
Well, that was
a giant cell phone.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.067
Ah, I remember those.

29:08.133 --> 29:09.700
Ricky, hey. Ricky!

29:09.767 --> 29:11.133
Uh, someone by
the name of Lindsay

29:11.200 --> 29:12.300
called for you
this morning.

29:12.367 --> 29:15.233
Oh! The orthopedic
surgeon. Nice!

29:15.300 --> 29:16.467
She must like you.

29:16.533 --> 29:17.367
I don't know what she does
for a living,

29:17.433 --> 29:18.467
but she called twice.

29:18.533 --> 29:19.700
I don't like
the sound of that.

29:19.767 --> 29:20.967
That's weird.

29:21.067 --> 29:21.967
I attract weird.

29:22.067 --> 29:22.967
You do.

29:23.067 --> 29:24.367
Ooh! A surgeon groupie?

29:24.433 --> 29:25.700
I wonder,
is that a surgeon

29:25.767 --> 29:26.900
who likes groupies?

29:26.967 --> 29:28.300
Or a groupie
who likes surgeons?

29:28.367 --> 29:29.800
'Cause, the way I see it,
the "groupie" thing

29:29.867 --> 29:31.233
takes precedence.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.767
Kinda freaky, but then, she does
have all that schooling,

29:33.833 --> 29:36.067
so maybe we go with
"Dr. Stalker Surgeon Groupie."

29:36.133 --> 29:38.633
I like the sound of that!
"Dr. Stalker Surgeon Groupie."

29:38.700 --> 29:40.500
What's the message, Alan?

29:40.567 --> 29:41.800
Oh, yeah. The message.
She's out front.

29:44.367 --> 29:46.067
She seemed so normal.

29:46.067 --> 29:47.233
Don't they all?

29:47.300 --> 29:50.800
Oh, go, your Dr. Surgeon
Stalker Groupie awaits.

29:50.867 --> 29:51.767
Whew.

29:57.733 --> 29:59.267
Hey, Steph. Ahem.

29:59.333 --> 30:00.767
You know what
I was thinking?

30:00.833 --> 30:02.133
I couldn't possibly.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.433
I was thinking
that I'm gonna start

30:03.500 --> 30:05.267
a new boxing-cardio class.

30:05.333 --> 30:08.033
Well, uh, you can talk
to Ricky about it.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.833
I'd be happy to see
your presentation.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.900
Okay, um, well, you come in,

30:11.967 --> 30:13.133
you start with
a little knees--

30:13.200 --> 30:14.233
-...And then just--
-No! Alan! Alan...

30:14.300 --> 30:15.900
-Ba-bap! Ba-bap!
-I didn't mean now.

30:15.967 --> 30:17.000
-Not now.
-Not now?

30:17.067 --> 30:18.167
You know what?

30:18.233 --> 30:19.800
Maybe I don't see
your presentation.

30:19.867 --> 30:23.033
Okay, well, maybe just knees--
"Hey, guys, how're you doing?"

30:23.100 --> 30:25.267
Let's warm it up--
Airplane arms.

30:25.333 --> 30:26.167
I don't think
that warms it up.

30:26.233 --> 30:27.167
No?

30:27.233 --> 30:29.700
I felt compelled to see you.

30:30.967 --> 30:32.267
And bring you this.

30:32.333 --> 30:34.267
Oh, wow. Compelled...

30:34.333 --> 30:36.067
after one date.

30:36.133 --> 30:37.500
I-I'm flattered.

30:37.567 --> 30:40.667
Uh, look, I know that
you're friends with Jackie--

30:40.733 --> 30:42.367
I want to have kids.

30:42.433 --> 30:43.767
Oh... wow.

30:43.833 --> 30:45.900
Oh. Not with you.

30:45.967 --> 30:47.800
Uh, um...

30:47.867 --> 30:50.433
I was just alarmed,
then insulted.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.800
I'm sorry.

30:51.867 --> 30:52.900
Let's go back.

30:52.967 --> 30:54.400
I am a little giddy here.

30:54.467 --> 30:56.167
And clearly,
coming off like

30:56.233 --> 30:58.800
some crazy-surgeon-stalker
lady.

30:58.867 --> 31:01.833
Exactly. I was just telling
my staff that I was scared.

31:01.900 --> 31:03.533
I wanted to thank you
in person.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.333
Listening to you talk about
your daughters last night,

31:06.400 --> 31:08.067
it made me think.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.500
I never wanted kids.

31:10.567 --> 31:12.267
I always thought
I was gonna have to choose

31:12.333 --> 31:14.333
between career or kids.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.533
Honestly, Ricky,

31:16.600 --> 31:19.500
hearing you go on about
that profound feeling...

31:19.567 --> 31:21.400
I want that,

31:21.467 --> 31:22.833
and it's missing in my life,

31:22.900 --> 31:24.067
and now I know it.

31:24.100 --> 31:25.067
I did that?

31:25.100 --> 31:26.167
Mm-hmm.

31:26.233 --> 31:28.067
Wow, I'm good.

31:28.067 --> 31:29.067
Real good.

31:29.067 --> 31:30.833
Yes, you are.

31:30.900 --> 31:32.367
10 months ago,

31:32.433 --> 31:35.500
I broke up with this guy
I'd been seeing for five years,

31:35.567 --> 31:37.433
and, um...

31:37.500 --> 31:40.067
we split because
I didn't want to have kids

31:40.067 --> 31:42.800
and he did.

31:42.867 --> 31:45.400
I called him last night...

31:45.467 --> 31:48.267
Ooh... Ooh, tell me more.
I love a good soap.

31:48.333 --> 31:50.067
H-He's gone out
with a few women,

31:50.067 --> 31:51.500
but no one serious, so...

31:51.567 --> 31:55.067
we're seeing each other
tonight.

31:55.100 --> 31:57.233
So... no second date for me?

31:58.833 --> 32:00.233
Mm...

32:00.300 --> 32:02.533
I will let you know
what goes on.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.933
Thank you, Ricky.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.200
You're a good guy.

32:06.267 --> 32:08.067
Oh, now I'm kinda sad

32:08.133 --> 32:11.233
that you're not surgeon-stalker-
crazy-lady.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.233
Bye.

32:13.300 --> 32:15.133
Bye.

32:26.533 --> 32:29.167
I got some stuff for you guys.

32:34.133 --> 32:35.400
You're selling Teddy?

32:35.467 --> 32:38.700
Yeah. It's old and useless.

32:38.767 --> 32:40.067
Only got one eye.

32:40.100 --> 32:42.267
How much
should we charge?

32:42.333 --> 32:44.067
It's up to you.

32:51.133 --> 32:53.500
Here. Take this.

32:54.433 --> 32:56.433
It's a Roomba.
I don't like it buzzing around.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.767
I can do my own vacuuming.

32:58.833 --> 33:00.067
Sorry, Abuela.

33:00.067 --> 33:02.933
This garage sale
just has to be our stuff.

33:03.067 --> 33:04.333
So we can say
we raised the money.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.533
For whatever we might buy...
with our money.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.533
Okay, I can see
I'm not wanted here.

33:10.600 --> 33:13.267
If you don't want Roomba,
you don't get Roomba.

33:14.433 --> 33:16.067
We can't
buy her present

33:16.100 --> 33:17.400
with her money.

33:17.467 --> 33:20.167
Exactly. That would be
like her buying it.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.433
Oh, poor Teddy.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.367
Mirabel's
gonna miss him.

33:25.433 --> 33:26.767
I already know it.

33:26.833 --> 33:27.933
And this is--

33:28.067 --> 33:29.233
it's just I've worked
for this really hard,

33:29.300 --> 33:30.900
I've put a lot of
effort into this.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.867
Hey! What are you
still doing here?

33:32.933 --> 33:34.233
Go and enjoy
your weekend.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.133
I got this.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.200
Oh, correction,
young Stephanie--

33:38.267 --> 33:39.533
we got this.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.167
What are you still
doing here, boss?

33:41.233 --> 33:43.267
Like the lady said,
we got this.

33:43.333 --> 33:45.067
'Kay? Everything's a-okay.
We're rockin' and rollin'!

33:45.100 --> 33:46.300
Steph and me, 'kay?

33:46.367 --> 33:48.267
Steph and moi.
Steph and me! We got this.

33:48.333 --> 33:49.933
Tap that!

33:50.067 --> 33:50.900
Okay, first...

33:50.967 --> 33:51.800
What?

33:51.867 --> 33:53.467
It's not "Steph."

33:53.533 --> 33:54.900
It's Stephanie.

33:54.967 --> 33:57.200
And second,
he's right.

33:57.267 --> 33:59.133
Go home.
We're fine.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.967
I'm waiting for Mirabel.
She's meeting me here.

34:01.067 --> 34:02.100
She's not coming.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.300
Did she call you?

34:03.367 --> 34:05.567
Well, Snapchat.
As of 10 minutes ago,

34:05.633 --> 34:08.200
she was getting rid of
this teddy bear with one eye.

34:08.267 --> 34:10.067
Sad. Really sad-looking item.

34:10.133 --> 34:12.500
That man is overbooked.
You ever notice that?

34:12.567 --> 34:14.067
When does he even sit down?

34:14.067 --> 34:16.233
He's just constantly going
and moving. Look at this!

34:16.300 --> 34:17.400
Bye!

34:17.467 --> 34:19.133
Moving and flipping
around the thing.

34:19.200 --> 34:20.433
-You know, it's people like--
-Get back to work.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.367
Yeah, okay, sure.

34:25.067 --> 34:27.067
Oh! Man, it looks like
it's going great!

34:27.133 --> 34:29.167
Where's Mirabel?

34:29.233 --> 34:31.200
Okay.

34:50.233 --> 34:52.333
Can we talk?

34:55.067 --> 34:58.533
So, um...
rumor has it

34:58.600 --> 35:00.233
you're selling
Teddy on Snapchat.

35:02.467 --> 35:06.133
I'm selling Teddy,
but not on Snapchat.

35:06.200 --> 35:09.133
I posted a video
of him on Snapchat.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.467
Oh.

35:10.533 --> 35:13.067
Yeah, I just
figured out Instagram,

35:13.067 --> 35:16.133
so you have to be
patient with me.

35:21.767 --> 35:24.900
Mirabel...
I love you.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.600
I know.

35:30.167 --> 35:33.933
And we're gonna have
some tricky times ahead.

35:35.467 --> 35:39.167
We've been through
the worst thing imaginable,

35:39.233 --> 35:42.633
and we're here...

35:42.700 --> 35:44.467
and we love one another.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.567
And we're gonna get through

35:49.633 --> 35:51.667
whatever horror

35:51.733 --> 35:54.167
your teenage years
throw at us.

35:58.367 --> 36:00.467
I miss her so much, Daddy.

36:00.533 --> 36:03.500
I know.

36:03.567 --> 36:06.333
It's not fair.

36:06.400 --> 36:07.700
No.

36:14.867 --> 36:19.133
Who's gonna take me shopping
for my wedding dress?

36:20.233 --> 36:21.667
Oh.

36:21.733 --> 36:23.667
I will.

36:25.367 --> 36:27.267
And Rosa will.

36:27.333 --> 36:29.067
And your sisters will.

36:29.133 --> 36:32.200
We will take you shopping
for your wedding dress.

36:38.067 --> 36:40.667
And I will walk you
down that aisle,

36:40.733 --> 36:43.367
and your beautiful mother

36:43.433 --> 36:45.733
will be missed at every moment
of that day,

36:45.800 --> 36:47.367
and every other day.

36:51.233 --> 36:53.200
It's not fair,
but...

36:54.300 --> 36:56.267
It's the way it is.

36:56.333 --> 36:59.300
And you,

36:59.367 --> 37:01.800
and your sisters,
you got ripped off,

37:01.867 --> 37:03.667
you got--
you got robbed.

37:03.733 --> 37:06.233
And it sucks.

37:06.300 --> 37:07.800
There's no dancing
around that.

37:07.867 --> 37:09.567
It sucks.

37:12.233 --> 37:14.067
I love you, Papi.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.267
I'm sorry I yelled.

37:17.333 --> 37:19.533
Oh, please. It's fine.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.767
I was more shocked
than anything.

37:21.833 --> 37:24.667
And you're kinda scary.

37:26.300 --> 37:28.567
Ohh.

37:28.633 --> 37:30.100
Hey, I just--
I wanna, um...

37:30.167 --> 37:32.667
interject one thing,

37:32.733 --> 37:35.567
and then we never
have to discuss it,

37:35.633 --> 37:38.700
hopefully, for
a really, really...

37:38.767 --> 37:40.767
really long time.

37:40.833 --> 37:42.600
Um...

37:42.667 --> 37:44.500
Your wedding dress...

37:44.567 --> 37:49.633
w-will contain a large
amount of fabric, okay?

37:49.700 --> 37:53.233
Like, covering
all body parts.

37:53.300 --> 37:55.833
I'll go full-Amish, Papi.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.767
Oh, my gosh!
I-I would love that!

37:57.833 --> 38:00.233
Full-Amish, it is.
I'm holding you to it.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.133
Come here.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.700
Mm. I love you.

38:04.767 --> 38:07.633
I love you so much.

38:15.300 --> 38:18.767
What do you say we go help
your sisters make some money?

38:20.267 --> 38:22.433
Teddy!

38:22.500 --> 38:23.567
Teddy!

38:24.867 --> 38:26.800
Teddy.

38:30.733 --> 38:32.300
Whoa! I don't think so, Buddy.

38:35.567 --> 38:38.133
Here. Take, uh, Sheldon.

38:39.500 --> 38:42.100
Go on.
He's on me.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.200
Oh, so you don't knock?

38:55.267 --> 38:56.833
You have never knocked
in your life.

38:56.900 --> 38:59.467
I called, I texted,

38:59.533 --> 39:00.800
I emailed,

39:00.867 --> 39:02.700
I may have even sent a fax,

39:02.767 --> 39:04.233
and nothing, no response.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.500
I thought you were dead!

39:05.567 --> 39:06.633
I might as well be.

39:06.700 --> 39:09.933
Oh, okay,
easy with the drama, Rosa.

39:10.067 --> 39:11.933
My youngest granddaughters
don't love me!

39:12.067 --> 39:13.800
You need
to chill, woman,

39:13.867 --> 39:16.567
and are you having
a dinner party?

39:17.933 --> 39:20.300
I cook when I'm sad.
You know this!

39:20.367 --> 39:22.867
W-Whatever you're cooking,
you need to stop,

39:22.933 --> 39:24.767
turn it off,
and come with me.

39:24.833 --> 39:25.967
But where?

39:26.067 --> 39:27.567
Oh, God! Honestly!

39:27.633 --> 39:30.367
Honestly, between Mirabel
and the Kardashian look,

39:30.433 --> 39:32.067
and Teddy almost selling,

39:32.067 --> 39:33.867
and Bill and Jackie
and the ambush-dating,

39:33.933 --> 39:36.067
and potential
surgeon-stalker drama,

39:36.100 --> 39:38.833
and now you with
this woe-is-me thing happening?

39:38.900 --> 39:40.800
I'm exhausted!

39:40.867 --> 39:42.733
I need a drink.

39:42.800 --> 39:43.733
Me too.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.267
Mm.

39:48.533 --> 39:50.300
Thank you.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.533
Mm. Ohh.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.767
That's nice.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.233
Now, what
were you saying?

40:03.300 --> 40:04.700
I'm saying,

40:04.767 --> 40:07.200
I'm leaving,
and you're coming with me.

40:07.267 --> 40:08.500
Where are we going?

40:08.567 --> 40:09.867
Into the living room.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.467
-All right, all right.
-Come on.

40:14.533 --> 40:15.933
Move that tushie,
move that tushie.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.433
Come on. I know you can move
faster than that, Rosa.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.367
Let's go. We're almost there.

40:20.433 --> 40:21.367
Here we are.

40:21.433 --> 40:23.400
Surprise!

40:23.467 --> 40:25.900
Oh, ho! Oh, my!

40:25.967 --> 40:27.567
What have you done?

40:27.633 --> 40:29.700
This is beautiful.

40:29.767 --> 40:31.500
Do you like it?

40:31.567 --> 40:32.833
We got you four fish

40:32.900 --> 40:34.533
because there's three of us
and one of you.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.533
Well, what about me?
There's one of me.

40:37.933 --> 40:39.667
I just love it.

40:39.733 --> 40:41.367
You did this for me?

40:41.433 --> 40:43.300
That's why you couldn't
help us with the garage sale.

40:43.367 --> 40:45.233
We wanted to do it
on our own.

40:45.300 --> 40:46.900
See? What'd I tell you? Hmm?

40:46.967 --> 40:49.567
Of course.

40:49.633 --> 40:52.033
I love this so much.
I never had fish!

40:52.100 --> 40:54.600
We didn't want you
to be lonely.

40:54.667 --> 40:56.200
Abuela's not lonely.

40:56.267 --> 41:00.300
Now that you're a teenager,
you need to learn some decorum.

41:00.367 --> 41:01.300
What's that?

41:01.367 --> 41:02.500
Like I said.

41:02.567 --> 41:05.067
Gigi, I need you
to explain everything.

41:05.133 --> 41:07.433
I need to know
what to feed them, and when.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.400
-I'll make you a chart.
-Okay.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.500
Or I can do
a PowerPoint presentation.

41:11.567 --> 41:13.400
Uh, a chart'll do.

41:13.467 --> 41:15.333
And, Elisa, can you
help me name them?

41:15.400 --> 41:16.467
I don't know what to call them.

41:16.533 --> 41:17.833
Mm. Why don't you
name one of them Ricky?

41:17.900 --> 41:19.267
Ricky's
a good name.

41:19.333 --> 41:20.800
Ricky keeps
the family together.

41:20.867 --> 41:22.633
Ricky pays
for stuff.

41:22.700 --> 41:23.900
Not about you, Dad.

41:23.967 --> 41:25.333
Whatever.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.933
So why don't we eat,

41:27.067 --> 41:28.900
and we'll figure out
what to name the fish?

41:28.967 --> 41:30.333
Good.
I'm starving.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.300
What are we having?

41:31.367 --> 41:32.733
Fish! Uh...

41:34.433 --> 41:36.367
Sorry.

41:38.333 --> 41:41.300
I think she should
totally name one Ricky.

41:47.867 --> 41:49.800
I love you, Dad.

41:51.867 --> 41:53.867
I love you more.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.100
That one,
right there.

42:00.167 --> 42:01.967
He's kinda macho!
He could be Rick.

42:02.067 --> 42:02.967
Yeah.

42:03.067 --> 42:05.067
Rick. Ricardo.
