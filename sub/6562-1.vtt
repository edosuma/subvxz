A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE,

03:39.400 --> 03:42.567

06:00.567 --> 06:03.300
AND NOBODY HAS COME OVER
TO SAY "HI" OR "HEY"

06:03.333 --> 06:04.533
OR, "WE'RE NEW
TO THE PALMWOODS,

06:04.567 --> 06:06.167
AND WE HEARD YOU GUYS
RULE THE POOL."

06:06.200 --> 06:07.733
- OR THESE KIDS HAVE BEEN HERE

06:07.767 --> 06:09.467
WHILE YOU WERE ON TOUR.

06:12.233 --> 06:14.733
YEAH, SEE THOSE GUYS OVER THERE

TO LIL' LEE ROTH.

06:24.333 --> 06:27.367
HE'S SINGLE-HANDEDLY
BRINGING BACK THE HAIR BAND.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.300
- NO MATTER HOW BIG THEY ARE,

06:30.333 --> 06:33.400
THEY SHOULD KNOW US
AND WANT TO HANG WITH US.

06:33.433 --> 06:35.400
WE'RE BIG TIME RUSH!
WE AUTOGRAPHED A PIG!

06:35.433 --> 06:37.367
- YEAH, BUT, I MEAN,
I DIDN'T HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS

06:37.400 --> 06:39.967
UNTIL I FOUND OUT HOW CRAZY
YOU ARE WITH YOUR FIRE PIT JAMS

06:40.000 --> 06:41.900
AND PARTIES
AND GENERAL YOUTHFUL ANTICS.

06:41.933 --> 06:44.200

06:44.233 --> 06:46.833
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

06:49.700 --> 06:53.100
[yells]

06:54.400 --> 06:55.633
WHOO-HOO!

06:55.667 --> 06:58.733

06:59.733 --> 07:01.467
- WELL, YOU GOT THEIR ATTENTION.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.967
BUT NOW THEY HATE YOU.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.833
[all yelling angrily]

07:07.433 --> 07:10.300
- SORRY.

07:10.333 --> 07:11.567
- COME ON, MISS COLLINS.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.367
WE CAN'T GET ALL THIS WORK DONE
BY TOMORROW.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.800
- WELL, I COULD GIVE YOU
AN EXTENSION,

07:15.833 --> 07:18.333
BUT ASPA RULES STATE
THAT YOU CANNOT PERFORM

07:18.367 --> 07:19.800
UNTIL ALL YOUR ASSIGNMENTS
ARE COMPLETE

07:19.833 --> 07:21.400
WITH AT LEAST
A C-PLUS AVERAGE.

07:21.433 --> 07:22.300
- WHOA, WHOA.

07:22.333 --> 07:23.833
NOBODY INFORMED ME OF THIS.

07:23.867 --> 07:25.300
- YES, I DID.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.633
I SENT ALL THE INFORMATION,
EMAILED ALL THE ASSIGNMENTS,

07:27.667 --> 07:29.533
AND WAS TOLD EVERYTHING
WAS BEING TAKEN CARE OF.

07:29.567 --> 07:32.467
- REALLY, BY WHO?

07:32.500 --> 07:33.667
ARE YOU NUTS?

07:33.700 --> 07:36.200
- I DIDN'T TELL THE BOYS
ABOUT SCHOOL

07:36.233 --> 07:38.367
BECAUSE I NEEDED THEM
TO FOCUS ON THE TOUR,

07:38.400 --> 07:40.067
AND I DIDN'T TELL YOU

07:40.100 --> 07:41.233
BECAUSE YOU WOULD
JUST YELL AT ME,

07:41.267 --> 07:43.200
LIKE YOU DID JUST THERE.

07:43.233 --> 07:45.967
- YEAH, BUT IF THEY DON'T GET
ALL OF THEIR SCHOOLWORK DONE

07:46.000 --> 07:48.733
BY TOMORROW,
THEY CAN'T WORK.

07:48.767 --> 07:52.067
- YEAH, NO REHEARSALS,
NO RECORDINGS, NO CONCERTS.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.000
- AND WHO CARES?

07:54.033 --> 07:55.367
I NEED A BREAK FROM YOU DOGS.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.300
SO TAKE YOUR TIME
AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK,

07:58.333 --> 08:02.500
BECAUSE THE TOUR IS OVER.

08:02.533 --> 08:03.900
- SWELL NEWS, EVERYONE.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.533
THE TOUR IS NOT OVER.

08:05.567 --> 08:07.133
BECAUSE TOMORROW,

08:07.167 --> 08:10.967
BIG TIME RUSH IS PLAYING
K-BLAST'S FAMOUS ROCKTOBERFEST.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.033

ON K-BLAST'S ROCKTOBERFEST?

08:14.067 --> 08:15.467
HOW?

08:15.500 --> 08:19.367
- WITH A LITTLE WHEELING,
A LITTLE DEALING, AND POISON.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.400
NOW, WHY DO KELLY AND LOGAN
LOOK WORRIED?

08:23.433 --> 08:25.700
- NO, THEY ARE NOT WORRIED!

08:25.733 --> 08:29.067
THEY JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
ROCKTOBER IS ALREADY HERE!

08:29.100 --> 08:30.067
HURRAY!

08:30.100 --> 08:31.333
I LOVE ROCKTOBER!

08:31.367 --> 08:33.367

08:35.700 --> 08:40.667
REMEMBER, BIG TIME RUSH,
ROCKTOBER, POISON.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.400
- OH, NO!

08:43.433 --> 08:47.667
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

08:47.700 --> 08:48.900
- IT'S HARD TO TELL HOW LONG

08:48.933 --> 08:50.367
THE BODIES HAVE BEEN
LAYING THERE.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.567
- THEY'RE COLD.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.833
REAL COLD.

08:52.867 --> 08:55.300
- WE'VE BEEN HERE
FOR ALMOST A YEAR,

08:55.333 --> 08:56.233
WHICH IS LONGER THAN YOU GUYS.

08:56.267 --> 08:57.833
- YEAH, AND WE'RE COLD

08:57.867 --> 09:02.000
BECAUSE YOU NEW KIDS TOOK
