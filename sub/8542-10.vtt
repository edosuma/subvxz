[Cho]
The attack took place
in the middle of a shift change.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.620
Normally the shift
works till morning,

00:11.707 --> 00:14.188
but some of the crew
had a bachelor party tonight.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.539
Who's getting married?

00:17.626 --> 00:19.280
Toby Rawlins.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.847
He found the victim seconds
after his throat was cut.

00:21.934 --> 00:24.633
Mm. That's gotta be
the worst bachelor party ever.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.156
[Teresa]
'Did toby see what happened?'

00:26.243 --> 00:28.463
He saw a hooded man
run into the woods.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.726
Jeans, dark jacket.
Couldn't make out a face.

00:30.813 --> 00:32.423
Any sign of a murder weapon?

00:32.510 --> 00:34.164
Nothing.

00:34.251 --> 00:37.559
- Who's the victim?
- Paul Satterfield.

00:37.646 --> 00:40.649
25 years on the job,
multiple citations for bravery.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.702
It's not your fault.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.965
Yeah, I know that.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.316
Unless, of course,
you did it.

00:55.403 --> 00:57.622
- Did you kill him?
- No!

00:57.709 --> 00:59.015
Okay.
Just had to ask.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.845
What are you doing
out here, anyway?

01:02.932 --> 01:05.630
Don't you have to celebrate
your last day of freedom?

01:05.717 --> 01:07.502
Paul couldn't make the party.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.417
He never leaves
his shift early.

01:09.504 --> 01:12.942
But he bought me a cigar
for us to smoke together.

01:13.029 --> 01:15.988
So someone knew the victim
was coming out here?

01:16.076 --> 01:19.209
If you're saying one of
our guys did this, no way.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.559
I saw the killer
get away through there.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.084
Look, we had half the fire
station looking for him.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.694
Guys from two shifts.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.870
Could be the killer
circled back around

01:27.957 --> 01:30.090
and joined the search
for himself.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.918
Could have happened. It would
have been chaotic out here.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.704
Paul Satterfield
was one of us.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.488
We all loved him
like a brother.

01:37.575 --> 01:41.013
Yeah. You've heard of
Cain and Abel, right?

01:41.101 --> 01:43.799
Cho, gather the firefighters.
We need to establish a timeline.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.105
Can I borrow
your flashlight?

01:45.192 --> 01:47.107
I'm gonna go looking
for the murder weapon.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.605
Jane?

02:51.867 --> 02:54.522
Jane, you out here?

02:54.609 --> 02:57.002
Jane, come on!

03:03.792 --> 03:05.141
No.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.497
Paramedics!

03:13.584 --> 03:15.934
I need help now!
Please!

03:20.374 --> 03:22.158
[theme music]

03:30.993 --> 03:32.212
[male #1]
Still not breathing.
No pulse.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.517
- Is he prone to seizures?
- No.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.351
How long has he
been out here?

03:41.438 --> 03:45.137
I don't know.
Um, seven, eight minutes, maybe.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.618
- Defibrillator, standing by.
- Clear.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.841
Please.

04:17.169 --> 04:19.520
- Jane... Jane, are you okay?
- Got a rhythm.

04:20.782 --> 04:23.088
Bring that O2 up.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.047
Can you hear me? Jane?

04:29.094 --> 04:30.661
Get him ready
for transport.

04:30.748 --> 04:34.926
On my count.
One, two, three, lift.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.667
- Coming through.
- Hey, watch yourselves.

04:36.754 --> 04:40.454
Make a hole, make a hole.
Coming through.

04:40.541 --> 04:41.585
How is he?

04:41.672 --> 04:43.065
He's breathing.

04:43.152 --> 04:45.676
He's gonna be fine.
He'll be fine.

04:45.763 --> 04:48.592
[monitor beeping steadily]

04:56.296 --> 04:57.297
Jane?

05:03.172 --> 05:04.434
How you feeling?

05:05.827 --> 05:07.481
Excellent, I think.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.789
It's good to see
you breathing.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.923
It's good to
see you, period.

05:15.010 --> 05:18.405
We're doing everything we can
to find your attacker.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.711
You didn't happen
to see a face, did you?

05:20.798 --> 05:23.410
No.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.281
Not that I can remember.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.065
What's the last thing
you do remember?

05:35.117 --> 05:36.727
Are we sleeping together?

05:36.814 --> 05:39.208
Excuse me?

05:39.295 --> 05:40.731
Well, you're a cop,
that's obvious

05:40.818 --> 05:42.777
but you're not treating me
like a suspect.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.562
And I can't see any other
reason for a police officer

05:45.649 --> 05:48.348
to come to my bedside
unless we're--

05:48.435 --> 05:49.784
Unless we're
sleeping together.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.614
You don't know who I am?

05:53.701 --> 05:56.443
Please don't take it personally.
I'm sure you're quite memorable.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.619
I just, I've been
through a lot..

05:58.706 --> 06:00.316
...apparently.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.579
No.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.234
We are not
sleeping together.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.149
We're working toward it,
though, right?

06:07.236 --> 06:08.411
So I haven't
missed anything?

06:10.108 --> 06:11.327
What's your name?

06:14.025 --> 06:15.287
Are you putting me on?

06:16.811 --> 06:17.855
I wish I was.

06:19.640 --> 06:23.078
Um, I'm Teresa Lisbon
with the CBI.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.863
I'm a homicide detective.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.256
You're my consultant.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.650
I catch bad guys?
Wow, that sounds like fun.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.695
I always wanted to pit
my psychic skills

06:31.782 --> 06:32.783
against criminals.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.785
You're not a psychic.

06:34.872 --> 06:36.787
You used to pretend
to be one, but--

06:36.874 --> 06:38.093
But what?

06:39.790 --> 06:41.531
Teresa?

06:41.618 --> 06:43.881
Uh, I'm sorry.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.928
I should have talked to the
doctor before I came here. I--

06:47.015 --> 06:49.539
Whoa, whoa.
Teresa, wait.

06:49.626 --> 06:51.802
I saw something
during my attack.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.413
What did you see?

06:54.283 --> 06:56.285
A light.

06:56.372 --> 06:57.417
What kind of light?

06:59.157 --> 07:02.247
White light.
Intensely bright.

07:02.334 --> 07:04.685
And I walked toward it.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.991
There were people, lots of
people gathered around

07:07.078 --> 07:09.080
reaching out
with their hands to me.

07:09.167 --> 07:12.432
There was a woman--
A woman who knew you.

07:14.477 --> 07:15.522
Your mother.

07:15.609 --> 07:17.828
Jane, I'm not impressed.

07:17.915 --> 07:21.919
I told you my mother
died when I was a girl.

07:22.006 --> 07:25.923
Well, did you tell me
that she gave you that cross?

07:26.010 --> 07:31.276
You touched it just like that
when I was unconscious.

07:31.363 --> 07:34.410
It's what led her to me.

07:34.497 --> 07:37.631
'And now I can
lead her to you.'

07:37.718 --> 07:40.764
You wanna put me in touch
with my dead mother?

07:40.851 --> 07:44.942
I'm a psychic, Teresa.
That's what I do.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.423
- He doesn't know me.
- He doesn't know who he is.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.294
It's called
dissociative fugue--

07:49.381 --> 07:51.296
the temporary loss
of personal identity.

07:51.383 --> 07:54.038
It can last hours, months,
and in rare cases, years.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.518
But he remembers
some things

07:55.605 --> 07:57.607
like he used to be
a fake psychic.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.392
He did a reading on me,
it was a good one.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.264
Has he had any
previous traumas?

08:02.351 --> 08:04.222
His wife and daughter
were murdered.

08:04.309 --> 08:07.225
There you go. His subconscious
mind is protecting itself

08:07.312 --> 08:09.532
from further trauma
by blocking out that pain.

08:09.619 --> 08:12.100
As far as Patrick knows,
his family never existed.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.189
Their death is what
brought him to us.

08:14.276 --> 08:15.973
And that's why
he doesn't know you.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.627
But you're just
what he needs

08:17.714 --> 08:19.194
to get back on his feet.

08:22.632 --> 08:25.200
- How should we act?
- Normal.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.594
I never know how to act
around Jane normally.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.466
Then you're all set.
Don't talk about his past.

08:30.553 --> 08:33.121
It's important that his memories
come back on their own.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.384
He should still
be in the hospital.

08:35.471 --> 08:38.256
The doctor wants him
in a familiar environment.

08:38.343 --> 08:40.171
Is he gonna help
with the case?

08:40.258 --> 08:42.173
He says he can't wait.

08:42.260 --> 08:45.046
- You sure this is a good idea?
- I don't know.

08:45.133 --> 08:48.397
Jane needs something to hold on
to and we're gonna be there.

08:48.484 --> 08:49.964
Where are we with the victim?

08:50.051 --> 08:51.443
According to his co-workers

08:51.531 --> 08:53.184
Paul Satterfield
was a legend.

08:53.271 --> 08:55.883
The old guard respected him,
the younger guys idolized him.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.493
Satterfield left behind
a widow, Diane.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.016
They were together
for 16 years.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.540
She's coming by to talk.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.542
- Anything from the crime scene?
- No trace evidence.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.065
All the EMT'S
and firefighters

09:04.152 --> 09:07.329
trying to rescue him,
they contaminated everything.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.374
Okay, I vote we skip
the awkward introductions

09:09.461 --> 09:11.855
because you all know me,
and in one glance

09:11.942 --> 09:14.945
I know the same about you
as the day I forgot you.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.512
You gave us
a scare yesterday.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.558
Well, not my intention,
I assure you.

09:21.517 --> 09:25.129
Well, we're just glad
you pulled through.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.261
Thanks, Bigsby.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.873

It's Wayne Rigsby.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.614

09:31.701 --> 09:35.226
We're just working the case,
so feel free to jump in anytime.

09:35.313 --> 09:38.882
Okay. Your armed robber--

09:38.969 --> 09:41.015
desperate amateur.
Why work alone?

09:41.102 --> 09:43.844
Because he doesn't know
any other criminals.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.107
The Lucha Libremask
projects the correct attitude.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.718
But look..
Look what he is wearing.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.025
- Khakis and a fitted sweater.
- Jane--

09:51.112 --> 09:53.070
No wonder the guard
tried to shoot him.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.898
The closest a man
should ever come

09:54.985 --> 09:57.422
to touching it is helping
a woman out of one.

09:57.509 --> 10:00.338
Jane, another team is
handling the ATM lobby hit.

10:00.425 --> 10:01.644
We got the dead fireman.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.692
Got it.

into that death trap alone.?

10:48.038 --> 10:50.171
Go and find out.
Take Jane.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.651

10:51.738 --> 10:53.435
Whoever killed Satterfield
tried to kill you.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.785
Oh, you wanna give him
another try at that?

10:55.872 --> 10:58.483
You'll be okay.
Rigsby will be with you.

10:58.570 --> 11:02.139
Why is Teresa insisting that
I meet these firefighters?

11:02.226 --> 11:03.663
Well, you might
recognize the killer.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.229
Well, it's doubtful.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.536
I was attacked in the dark
and held underwater.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.799
Isn't it likely that
he took me from behind?

11:09.886 --> 11:11.322
Yeah, probably.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.629
But you're still good
at sussing out guilty parties.

11:13.716 --> 11:16.850
Huh.
How do I do that exactly?

11:16.937 --> 11:19.504
Uh, it's hard to say.
Causing trouble, mostly.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.332
And you don't mind?

No, we're a team.
We help each other out.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.336

11:40.743 --> 11:42.484
Oh.
You want a tip?

11:42.571 --> 11:44.051
[elevator bell dings]

11:44.138 --> 11:45.052
Back off.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.711
I thought we
were a team.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.367
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Satterfield.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.500
- You are, are you?
- Yes, ma'am.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.937
I hold firefighters
in the highest regard.

12:01.024 --> 12:04.593
Even ones who die
in a knife fight?

12:04.680 --> 12:06.595
Hell, even I didn't see
that one coming.

12:06.682 --> 12:08.902
Oh. You mind?

12:10.555 --> 12:11.556
It's not allowed.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.955
Did your husband
have any enemies?

12:19.042 --> 12:22.002
God, no.
Paul Satterfield was a hero.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.612
You didn't hear?

12:23.699 --> 12:24.874
You will.

12:27.659 --> 12:28.748
Where's your wedding ring?

12:30.619 --> 12:34.405
Oh, I'm having it
melted for cash.

12:34.492 --> 12:38.148
No, not really.
At least not for cash anyway.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.716
Having it resized
to fit my middle finger.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.283
Think of it
as a statement.

12:42.370 --> 12:45.199
Clearly you don't mind being
considered a murder suspect.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.114
Consider me
whatever you want.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.116
You know?

12:49.203 --> 12:51.596
You're wasting your time.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.120
I was working last night.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.599
Yeah? Where?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.427
Suicide prevention hotline.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.344
It's true.

13:00.431 --> 13:01.693
Two minutes with me

13:01.781 --> 13:04.218
and your life
ain't looking so bad.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.960
You sure I can't
have a smoke?

13:07.047 --> 13:11.225
[indistinct conversations]

13:11.312 --> 13:14.968
Gather around, please.
These men are with CBI.

13:15.055 --> 13:18.014
We're gonna do everything we can
to help them out for Paul.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.581
Thank you, captain.

13:19.668 --> 13:22.236
My name is Agent Rigsby.
This is Patrick Jane.

13:22.323 --> 13:25.021
I know that you're here
today are on your day off

13:25.108 --> 13:27.154
and I wanna thank
you all for coming.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.199
I spent a lot of time
working arson

13:29.286 --> 13:31.245
which is why I know
that Paul Satterfield

13:31.332 --> 13:34.161
was hung out to dry yesterday
during that house fire.

13:34.248 --> 13:35.727
- What are you suggesting?
- Doesn't matter.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.078
- I got what I need.
- You recognize the killer?

13:38.165 --> 13:40.341
No, but I've seen enough
to identify the killer.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.212
Or, more specifically

13:42.299 --> 13:44.998
your mascot here
has smelled enough.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.174
- What's his name?
- Hoser.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.653
Naturally. Uh, may I?

13:48.740 --> 13:49.741
Sure.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.526
Come on, Hoser.

13:51.613 --> 13:54.398
We've all heard of dogs
that have found their way home

13:54.485 --> 13:55.965
from thousands of miles away.

13:56.052 --> 13:59.882
That's because these animals
have a sixth sense.

13:59.969 --> 14:02.363
Natural disasters,
the presence of spirits

14:02.450 --> 14:05.366
some of them can even
detect cancer.

14:05.453 --> 14:08.021
- That's a bunch of crap.
- Really?

14:08.108 --> 14:10.066
An Atlanta woman
credits her dog Floyd Henry

14:10.153 --> 14:13.287
for pawing a cancerous tumor
which saved her life.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.549
Why do I remember that?

14:16.768 --> 14:19.902
In any case, on my command,
our canine friend here

14:19.989 --> 14:22.252
will use his
extrasensory perception

14:22.339 --> 14:26.387
to sniff out
a killer's guilt.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.389
And I do believe
he's found it.

14:28.476 --> 14:31.174
Hoser, go get the killer.

14:33.568 --> 14:34.874
- Huh.
- Hey.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.617
- What's this?
- Smoked kipper.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.271
Also known as red herring.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.317
[laughing]
I found it in your kitchen.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.494
[chuckling]
What?

14:48.148 --> 14:49.192
What's not funny?

14:49.279 --> 14:51.542
What's going on here?

14:51.629 --> 14:52.848
You said I cause trouble.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.197
Yeah, to help
the investigation.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.243
That guy's the paramedic
that saved your life.

14:56.330 --> 15:00.029
- Oh, well, thank you very much.
- No problem.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.727
- Are we done here?
- Not by a mile.

15:02.814 --> 15:06.688
When Hoser here was, uh,
pouncing on my rescuer

15:06.775 --> 15:09.560
I couldn't help but notice
a profound sense of relief

15:09.647 --> 15:11.780
from..

15:11.867 --> 15:13.521
...you, sir.

15:15.218 --> 15:16.916
What's your relationship
with the deceased?

15:17.003 --> 15:19.005
Um, not much.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.920
No sad feelings,
no wedding ring.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.660
[sniffs]

15:22.747 --> 15:24.358
That's ladies' perfume

15:24.445 --> 15:27.056
with a top note of orange
mixed with bitter almond.

15:27.143 --> 15:30.886
That's not a young
woman's fragrance.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.802
Were you sleeping
with the victim's wife?

15:33.889 --> 15:36.065
That's offensive.
Firefighters are a brotherhood.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.632
Wives are off-limits.

15:37.719 --> 15:38.938
Well, tell him that.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.548
It's time
for you to go.

15:40.635 --> 15:43.420
Huh, Larkin?

15:43.507 --> 15:45.683
- It's time for you to go.
- It's okay, cap.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.862
It's all gonna
come out anyway.

15:54.127 --> 15:56.999
What he said is true.

15:57.086 --> 15:58.958
I was having an affair
with Paul's wife.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.267
How was that?

16:04.354 --> 16:05.834
Yeah.
Just like the old you.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.322
Heard you riled 'em up
in there.

16:15.409 --> 16:16.845
Sounds like
the Jane I know.

16:16.932 --> 16:17.889
Hmm.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.982
Is anything coming
back to you?

16:23.069 --> 16:25.680
Kids prefer cheese
over fried green spinach.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.638
[chuckling]
Come again?

16:27.725 --> 16:30.554
It's an acronym for
the seven levels of taxonomy.

16:30.641 --> 16:33.253
Kingdom, phylum,
class, order

16:33.340 --> 16:35.995
family, genus,
species.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.344
Impressive.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.389
I can also name
the geological time periods

16:39.476 --> 16:41.043
the world's longest rivers
by size

16:41.130 --> 16:42.697
and the complete
works of Shakespeare

16:42.784 --> 16:44.264
in chronological order.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.353
So the memory palace
is intact.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.442
I told you
about the memory palace?

16:48.529 --> 16:49.617
We're friends.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.664
The doctor says it's
your emotional memories

16:53.751 --> 16:55.144
that are tripping you up.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.146
Has anything
come back to you?

16:57.233 --> 16:58.191
Anything at all?

16:58.278 --> 16:59.192
No.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.108
What do you remember
about this?

17:02.195 --> 17:03.848
My wedding ring?

17:03.935 --> 17:05.894
No better way
to gain a woman's trust

17:05.981 --> 17:09.463
than to wear a wedding ring,
except maybe buy a dog.

17:09.550 --> 17:12.509
Okay, so you wear a wedding ring
to get over on women?

17:12.596 --> 17:14.250
Worked on you.

17:14.337 --> 17:18.385
You remember the house fire
that we saw on the newscast?

17:18.472 --> 17:20.909
It was the only call
that the victim responded to

17:20.996 --> 17:22.737
the day that
he was murdered.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.739
I'm gonna have Cho
look at the house.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.001
Go with him.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.785
It's his turn
to babysit me now?

17:27.872 --> 17:29.787
Well, somebody has to.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.659
Pleasant weather.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.704
Has it been like
this all week?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.445
I guess. Why?

17:35.532 --> 17:39.797
Big elephants can always
understand small elephants

17:39.884 --> 17:42.452
because, Teresa, because.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.889
Oh. Oh, I get it.
It's another acronym.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.282
Mm.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.417
Were you at the firehouse

17:50.504 --> 17:52.201
the night the victim
was murdered?

17:52.288 --> 17:54.986
I left early to go
to the bachelor party.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.075
Were you with anyone?

17:56.162 --> 17:57.598
No.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.121
So you could have
circled back?

17:59.208 --> 18:01.732
I could have,
but I didn't.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.301
Why were you sleeping
with Mrs. Satterfield?

18:07.216 --> 18:08.565
It felt good.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.350
Good enough to want
her husband dead?

18:10.437 --> 18:12.134
I didn't want him dead.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.440
Oh, no?

18:13.527 --> 18:15.181
Well, I checked
yesterday's logs.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.921
You were
Satterfield's partner.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.707
You let him go upstairs
without backup, alone.

18:19.794 --> 18:24.190
I was the one who was
left without backup, okay?

18:24.277 --> 18:27.584
We live and dieby SOG's.
do you know what those are?

18:27.671 --> 18:29.064
Standard operating guidelines.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.544
Yeah.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.807
And we were conducting
a standard left-hand search

18:32.894 --> 18:35.201
of a fully involved house

18:35.288 --> 18:38.117
when Paul decides to run
upstairs and find the homeowner.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.814
Why didn't you go with him?

18:39.901 --> 18:44.035
He left me in a smoke-filled
room with zero visibility.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.430
I couldn't see my hand
in front of my face

18:47.517 --> 18:49.563
much less
which way he ran.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.915
That's the way it was
with Paul.

18:54.002 --> 18:57.223
He could break
every rule

18:57.310 --> 18:59.529
leave his
partner in danger

18:59.616 --> 19:01.052
and still
he's the hero.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.837
So why didn't you
tell the captain?

19:02.924 --> 19:04.404
Paul was good press.

19:08.973 --> 19:12.325
Look, I feel bad
that he's gone.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.327
But I'll tell you what.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.894
I'm glad that I don't
have to count on him

19:16.981 --> 19:19.158
to cover my back
at the next fire.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.078
You take this side
of the street.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.124
Find out if the neighbors
saw the victim

19:29.211 --> 19:30.908
interacting with anyone
suspicious during the fire.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.259
You want me to go
door to door?

19:33.346 --> 19:35.261
You do it all the time.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.045
It's one of the more
interesting things

19:37.132 --> 19:38.089
about being a consultant.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.179
[chuckling]

19:40.266 --> 19:42.137
You're a clever one,
Mr. Cho.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.921
And I'll do your bidding

19:44.008 --> 19:47.098
but first I wanna take a look
at this burned-out house.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.884
When can I go inside?
I need to get in there.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.626
CBI.
What's going on here?

19:52.713 --> 19:54.671
They won't let me
inside my house.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.325
It's a standard
arson investigation.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.762
- We'll call him when it's over.
- This is crazy.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.808
Why would I
set fire to my house?

20:00.895 --> 20:02.505
Everything is in there.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.638
- My kid's childhood--
- No one's accusing you, sir.

20:04.725 --> 20:07.467
I know you.
I saw you on the TV.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.817
The fireman saved your life.
Patrick Jane.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.646
Yeah. Tom Wilcox.

20:12.733 --> 20:15.910
I almost died yesterday, too,
but, uh, no news cameras.

20:15.997 --> 20:18.826
Did you know the man
who saved you was killed?

20:18.913 --> 20:22.699
Yeah, I read it
in the paper.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.745
I didn't get a chance
to thank him.

20:24.832 --> 20:27.182
Did you see the victim
in conflict with anyone?

20:27.269 --> 20:29.706
No, I was unconscious
the whole time.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.535
Me, too. The guy put
my head under the water.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.755
How did you black out?

20:34.842 --> 20:36.409
When the fire
jumped the fireplace

20:36.496 --> 20:39.194
I ran upstairs and grabbed
all the valuables that I could

20:39.281 --> 20:41.762
but the smoke was too thick,
and I couldn't breathe.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.459
Well, we both
cheated death.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.156
That, that's just..
That's remarkable.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.202
You know, we should
get t-shirts made up.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.725
Well, I'm glad
that you're happy

20:48.812 --> 20:50.597
but I lost
everything that I own.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.904
I got my wife and my daughter
in a motel I can't afford.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.732
Nothing but the clothes
on our backs.

20:55.819 --> 20:57.995
You can ask your insurance
company for an advance?

21:01.303 --> 21:03.087
My house isn't insured.

21:03.174 --> 21:05.655
I mean it was, but..

21:05.742 --> 21:07.309
I'm a savings
and loan officer

21:07.396 --> 21:09.311
and ever since
the banks collapsed

21:09.398 --> 21:10.921
I've been out of work.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.141
Okay. Well, let's forget
about the t-shirts, then.

21:13.228 --> 21:16.492
Mr. Cho, let's say we give
this poor man a ride back.

21:16.579 --> 21:17.580
Come on.

21:20.627 --> 21:23.325
- Okay, thanks.
- Hey, boss?

21:23.412 --> 21:24.848
On Rigsby's advice,
I went through

21:24.935 --> 21:26.372
Mrs. Satterfield's
credit reports.

21:26.459 --> 21:27.677
Take a look at this.

21:30.724 --> 21:33.422
Looks like our grieving widow
had a lot to celebrate.

21:33.509 --> 21:34.945
Yeah.

21:35.032 --> 21:37.034
I'm thinking about using
that life insurance money

21:37.121 --> 21:38.732
to redo my kitchen.

21:38.819 --> 21:41.691
No offense, Mrs. Satterfield,
but you're quite brazen.

21:41.778 --> 21:44.477
Which means you're either
innocent or stupid.

21:44.564 --> 21:47.044
Well, she doubled down on her
husband's life insurance policy

21:47.131 --> 21:48.611
a month before his murder.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.047
I'm going with stupid.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.223
Wouldn't be the first time
a cheating wife

21:52.311 --> 21:54.095
arranged for
her husband's death.

21:54.182 --> 21:55.966
You think I was unfaithful?

21:56.053 --> 21:58.055
You were sleeping
with another man.

21:58.142 --> 22:00.884
Paul knew about my affair.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.625
Truth is, he was relieved.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.845
I stopped begging
for his attention.

22:04.932 --> 22:07.238
He could never
give me what I wanted.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.894
- Which was?
- A marriage.

22:10.981 --> 22:13.723
He left ours years ago.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.769
My husband was a junkie.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.858
- Heroin?
- Adrenaline.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.599
Couldn't get enough of it.

22:19.686 --> 22:22.210
Drinking in all that glory

22:22.297 --> 22:23.951
dancing in the fire.

22:24.038 --> 22:27.346
How do you compete with
the high of being a hero?

22:28.999 --> 22:30.827
Why didn't you just leave him?

22:30.914 --> 22:32.351
And what kind of a settlement

22:32.438 --> 22:34.353
am I gonna get
from a firefighter?

22:34.440 --> 22:37.878
I upped the policy because his
death was just a matter of time.

22:37.965 --> 22:42.709
Every day, a race towards
the edge of a cliff.

22:42.796 --> 22:45.712
I bet getting stabbed was
the biggest rush of his life.

22:56.462 --> 22:57.637
Thanks for the ride.

22:57.724 --> 23:01.162
It's, uh, it's been
a tough day.

23:01.249 --> 23:02.381
Hi, dad!

23:02.468 --> 23:04.339
Hey, baby.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.080
Who are your friends?

23:06.167 --> 23:07.864
I'm Agent Cho.
This is Patrick Jane.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.692
We're investigating the murder
of Paul Satterfield.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.955
I was just reading
about him in the paper.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.653
'So sad.'

23:13.740 --> 23:15.698
'Lulu would be without
a father right now'

23:15.785 --> 23:17.004
'if it weren't for him.'

23:17.091 --> 23:18.919
Do you know anything
about the funeral?

23:19.006 --> 23:20.660
Uh, we'd like to be there.

23:20.747 --> 23:23.010
Well, they usually have that
information in the story.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.620
Let me have a look here.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.492
Oh, this clown again.

23:26.579 --> 23:29.364
He's stealing a lot of press
from our fallen hero.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.061
Did you find my dolls?

23:31.148 --> 23:32.802
I'm afraid not, honey.

23:32.889 --> 23:35.326
I still haven't been able
to get inside our house.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.199
Well, not to fear.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.984
Mister Cho here and I
will go back to your home

23:41.071 --> 23:44.292
and see what we can find
to make your life easier.

23:44.379 --> 23:47.556
- Yes!
- No, you don't have to do that.

23:47.643 --> 23:50.429
- It's okay.
- I miss my dolls.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.256
Not for long.

23:52.343 --> 23:53.736
Thank you, both of you.

23:53.823 --> 23:55.303
Shall we?

24:01.875 --> 24:03.311
What's your play here?

24:03.398 --> 24:04.878
I don't know what you mean.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.445
What are you trying to do?

24:06.532 --> 24:08.969
Bring a ray of hope
to a family, I suppose.

24:09.056 --> 24:11.362
And help my friends
solve a crime.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.760
I don't buy it.

24:17.847 --> 24:20.154
You don't help us
because you like us.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.723
I don't like you?

24:23.810 --> 24:25.507
Well, you don't
not like us.

24:25.594 --> 24:28.684
But you have deeper reasons
for helping people.

24:28.771 --> 24:31.513
Without those reasons,
you're a hustler.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.601
So what's your play?

24:34.473 --> 24:37.171
You're wrong about me,
Mr. Cho.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.042
I do like you.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.828
And I can assure you I wanna
help that little girl

24:41.915 --> 24:43.090
find her lost doll.

24:44.395 --> 24:45.396
Okay.

25:02.239 --> 25:03.589
What's wrong?

25:03.676 --> 25:08.245
This doll.
It reminds me of something.

25:08.332 --> 25:11.248
I can't, I can't quite..

25:12.989 --> 25:14.208
It's your family?

25:16.776 --> 25:18.038
Yeah, my family.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.478
I can't believe I..

25:26.176 --> 25:27.656
How could I forget my family?

25:31.225 --> 25:32.661
I'm sorry.

25:36.230 --> 25:39.799
Could you give me a minute,
please, Mr. Cho?

25:39.886 --> 25:41.540
Sure. I'll wait outside.

25:54.509 --> 25:57.381
[dial clicking]

26:12.266 --> 26:14.007
[knock on door]

26:14.094 --> 26:15.095
Jane?

26:18.185 --> 26:19.360
[door squeaking]

26:32.503 --> 26:35.594
Okay, if he does show up,
please call us right away.

26:35.681 --> 26:36.682
Thank you.

26:37.813 --> 26:39.206
He's not at the hospital.

26:39.293 --> 26:42.078
I'm starting to get worried.
He has no money or ID.

26:42.165 --> 26:44.167
Uh, yeah, he has money.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.909
Found this in my wallet
when we got back.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.345
"I owe you 60 bucks?"

26:48.432 --> 26:49.825
Yet I'm $63 light.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.392
He wasn't even honest
about that.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.089
Let's start calling
local cab companies

26:53.176 --> 26:55.875
see if any of the drivers
remember giving him a ride.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.920
It's my fault.
I should know better.

26:58.007 --> 27:00.531
So should I.
I'm the one who got him out.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.359
We were all marks today.

27:02.446 --> 27:03.534
Not me.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.277
What? He didn't con me.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.540
Only because he wants
to date you.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.107
Really?

27:11.194 --> 27:12.369
The death of Jane's family

27:12.456 --> 27:13.893
made him a better person.

27:13.980 --> 27:16.373
That person was always
inside of him.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.549
The murder just
brought it out.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.726
Rigsby.
Slow down. Who is this?

27:23.163 --> 27:24.643
Are you drunk?

27:24.730 --> 27:26.209
I do not do
spiritual readings.

27:26.296 --> 27:27.776
You must have
the wrong number.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.822
- No, stop! No, stop!
- Don't hang up!

27:29.909 --> 27:32.738
Hello?
Where are you calling from?

27:32.825 --> 27:37.830
Okay. I'm being pulled
in this direction.

27:37.917 --> 27:41.921
There's an older woman, an aunt
or a cousin coming through.

27:42.008 --> 27:45.228
There's a "K" connection.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.753
A "K" connection
somewhere over here.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.845
My mother's name
was Kate.

27:52.932 --> 27:55.195
Twins. She's saying
something about--

27:55.282 --> 27:56.849
What do you know
about twins?

27:56.936 --> 27:58.938
I'm a Gemini.

27:59.025 --> 28:01.680
That's your mother's way
of letting you know she's here.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.421
She's letting me know it's very
important that you know.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.554
'That you know
this is her opportunity'

28:06.641 --> 28:07.903
'to make a connection.'

28:07.990 --> 28:11.341
This is her chance
to come through.

28:11.428 --> 28:12.821
[voice breaking]
Okay.

28:12.908 --> 28:14.693
Okay.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.521
Your mother's saying..

28:17.608 --> 28:20.133
...she was killed.

28:20.220 --> 28:23.658
What I mean by that is..

28:23.745 --> 28:26.661
hers was not
a natural passing.

28:26.748 --> 28:27.923
Is that right?

28:28.010 --> 28:29.620
It was a car crash.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.666
Okay. I'm sorry.
Okay.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.364
[inhales and exhales deeply]

28:34.451 --> 28:36.932
That's how you lost her.
In a car crash.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.325
'That's what you tell people.'

28:38.412 --> 28:40.501
"I lost my mother
in a car crash.

28:40.588 --> 28:43.243
I lost her. I lost her."

28:43.330 --> 28:47.160
But what you're forgetting
is that she lost you, too.

28:47.247 --> 28:50.206
'There is no greater loss
than a parent's loss of a child'

28:50.293 --> 28:51.512
'but it's okay.'

28:51.599 --> 28:53.296
'She wants you
to know it's okay'

28:53.383 --> 28:55.429
'cause she's here with you.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.736
'She's here tonight,
and she's telling me'

28:57.823 --> 29:00.564
'that she wants a hug.'

29:00.651 --> 29:02.610
A huge hug.
Come here.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.307
Come here.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.657
come on, please.
Come on.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.702
[applauding]

29:07.789 --> 29:09.486
It's okay.

29:09.573 --> 29:10.749
Oh, that's okay.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.143
I hate him.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.710
That's not him.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.366
You're very brave.

29:19.453 --> 29:21.281
You have a very
strong connection.

29:21.368 --> 29:23.544
You won't lose that now.

29:23.631 --> 29:26.112
Thank you, folks. Whoo.

29:26.199 --> 29:29.028
[applauding]

29:34.468 --> 29:35.861
Hi.

29:35.948 --> 29:36.992
What are you doing?

29:37.079 --> 29:38.646
What's it look like?
Business.

29:38.733 --> 29:41.344
Excuse me. May I?

29:41.431 --> 29:42.998
This is Rigsby's card.

29:43.085 --> 29:45.784
Yeah, just you know until
I get my own printed up.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.786
You said that you
were dying to help.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.004
This is not helping.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.484
I am.

29:50.571 --> 29:52.965
I'm investigating. I felt bad
about the fish stunt

29:53.052 --> 29:54.314
I pulled on these boys

29:54.401 --> 29:57.317
so, uh, I decided to take
the "B" shift out

29:57.404 --> 29:59.580
for a night on the town.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.321
Make sure they're all
innocent of murder.

30:01.408 --> 30:02.888
Are they?

30:02.975 --> 30:04.628
They're the best of the best!

30:04.715 --> 30:06.413
- Yep! Yep!
- You are the man, paddy!

30:06.500 --> 30:08.154
- Thank you! Cheers!
- Cheers!

30:08.241 --> 30:11.722
Oh, he got the last round.
Could you thank him for me?

30:11.810 --> 30:13.681
We're going back
to the hospital now.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.204
I'm gonna take a rain check.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.553
I got another show later.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.381
I'm best with the late crowd.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.253
Are you gonna make me
call backup

30:20.340 --> 30:23.517
to get you out of this bar?
Because I will do that, paddy.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.087
Gentlemen

30:28.174 --> 30:29.436
the best of the best!

30:29.523 --> 30:31.003
- Yeah, buddy!
- Hey, paddy!

30:31.090 --> 30:33.614
- Salute.
- Well said, my man, well said.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.834
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.357
[rock music]

30:40.403 --> 30:43.189
I got it from here.
Thanks.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.104
I'll see you in the morning.

30:45.191 --> 30:47.106
Uh, no. Actually,
put a fork in it.

30:48.498 --> 30:50.674
I'm done.
No more police work.

30:50.761 --> 30:52.459
I understand.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.853
You can stay in the hospital
until your fine.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.812
What if I don't get fine?

30:57.899 --> 30:59.596
I talked to my
paramedic friends.

30:59.683 --> 31:02.469
All I need to be released
from this hospital

31:02.556 --> 31:05.472
is the signature
from a responsible adult

31:05.559 --> 31:07.909
and I got some
pretty tasty offers tonight.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.606
[laughing]

31:09.693 --> 31:11.130
And, this wedding ring--

31:11.217 --> 31:14.960
I can make you stay,
you know.

31:15.047 --> 31:17.701
It's in my power to hold you
as a material witness

31:17.788 --> 31:19.660
in a murder investigation.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.053
Why would you do that?

31:22.663 --> 31:25.448
You think I can't see
what's going on here?

31:25.535 --> 31:27.233
You people, you're,
you're tiptoeing.

31:27.320 --> 31:30.149
You're dancing around
some forgotten tragedy.

31:32.499 --> 31:34.588
I'm happy now. Just..

31:36.633 --> 31:38.461
Just let me be happy.

31:40.072 --> 31:41.725
Fair enough.

31:41.812 --> 31:44.728
Look, I'll miss you,
but I'll leave you alone, okay?

31:44.815 --> 31:47.340
Thank you, Teresa.
I appreciate it.

31:52.214 --> 31:55.435
Any parting thoughts
on the murder?

31:55.522 --> 31:57.959
Yeah, I figured out
who killed the fireman.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.221
You did? Who?

31:59.308 --> 32:00.353
Jacket left pocket.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.578
Kind of obvious,
don't you think?

32:08.665 --> 32:11.016
No.

32:11.103 --> 32:13.148
Should I spell it
out for you?

32:13.235 --> 32:14.845
Yes.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.631
I suppose you need me
to gift wrap the killer, too?

32:19.067 --> 32:20.677
You usually do.

32:20.764 --> 32:21.896
Hmm.

32:23.724 --> 32:26.248
My parting gift to you
I will give tomorrow morning.

32:26.335 --> 32:27.467
Goodnight.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.953
There's room up here.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.048
Moving van, huh?

32:43.135 --> 32:45.311
You have to put
a deposit down on that?

32:45.398 --> 32:46.616
I thought you were broke.

32:46.703 --> 32:49.880
Well, the investigation
is over.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.447
They let me in the house

32:51.534 --> 32:54.320
and I found our
emergency cash, thank god.

32:55.669 --> 32:56.844
And now you're going away?

32:56.931 --> 32:58.019
Montana.

32:58.106 --> 33:00.848
No. Prison.

33:00.935 --> 33:03.285
Put your game face on,
cockroach

33:03.372 --> 33:05.026
for the dignity
of your family.

33:05.113 --> 33:08.638
Hello there.
I got something for you.

33:08.725 --> 33:09.944
I do.
Look at this.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.120
Marcy-grace!

33:12.207 --> 33:14.209
- Yes.
- Oh, that is so nice of you.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.211
- What do you say, honey?
- Thank you.

33:16.298 --> 33:18.170
It's my pleasure.

33:18.257 --> 33:20.346
I found something else
in your house.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.174
We have to get on the road

33:22.261 --> 33:24.306
so whatever it is,
just keep it, okay?

33:24.393 --> 33:26.656
Come on. Get in the truck.
Let's go.

33:26.743 --> 33:28.180
Wait, what's this about?

33:28.267 --> 33:30.008
Well, I don't believe
it's anything

33:30.095 --> 33:31.487
your daughter
wants to hear about.

33:32.793 --> 33:33.750
Honey?

33:35.535 --> 33:37.493
[sighs]
Take her into the room.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.930
Just go. I'll explain later.
It's okay.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.543
Come on, baby.

33:44.979 --> 33:46.981
Get crazy with
those cheese puffs, kid!

33:47.068 --> 33:48.722
So cute.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.506
Before I show you
what I found

33:50.593 --> 33:53.292
I have to tell you
the story that goes with it.

33:53.379 --> 33:56.686
Um, it's a tale of
an ATM robbery gone wrong.

33:56.773 --> 33:59.124
I believe you read about it
in the newspapers.

34:05.347 --> 34:06.348
Put the bags down!

34:06.435 --> 34:07.654
'Do it!'

34:07.741 --> 34:09.351
Now your guns. Slowly.

34:12.528 --> 34:14.748
[Patrick]
'Well, I don't believe
the masked robber'

34:14.835 --> 34:17.272
'intended to hurt anyone,
but then again, they rarely do.'

34:20.449 --> 34:22.147
'The first thing
a smart criminal does'

34:22.234 --> 34:23.757
'is destroy the evidence.'

34:23.844 --> 34:26.977
'Fire, that's a very
popular way to do that.'

34:27.065 --> 34:30.068
'With the fireplace alight,
the masked robber'

34:30.155 --> 34:33.593
'ran upstairs to lock his stash
away in the bedroom safe.'

34:33.680 --> 34:36.552
'What he didn't know
was the fire downstairs'

34:36.639 --> 34:40.556
'was now burning
out of control.'

34:40.643 --> 34:43.472
[coughing]

34:43.559 --> 34:46.258
Excuse me, but what
does this have to do with me?

34:46.345 --> 34:48.695
Bear with me.
It's been a rough week.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.044
Now when the masked robber

34:50.131 --> 34:52.307
found the bottom floor
of his house on fire

34:52.394 --> 34:53.569
he should have
ran out.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.745
[coughing]

34:55.832 --> 34:58.748
'He couldn't abandon the cash,
not after all that.'

34:58.835 --> 35:00.054
'So he ran back upstairs.'

35:00.141 --> 35:01.969
'Problem is the smoke
was too thick.'

35:02.056 --> 35:04.102
'He couldn't breathe.'

35:04.189 --> 35:05.407
'The masked robber
passed out'

35:05.494 --> 35:09.019
'right there
in his own bedroom.'

35:09.107 --> 35:10.891
Are you accusing me
of armed robbery?

35:10.978 --> 35:12.284
Yes.

35:12.371 --> 35:13.937
And murder.

35:14.024 --> 35:16.679
Oh, and, uh,
attempted murder, too.

35:16.766 --> 35:18.290
Mine.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.639
Well, you must
be desperate.

35:19.726 --> 35:22.816
Hardly. I had you
pegged from the start.

35:22.903 --> 35:24.644
You know how
armored guards operate

35:24.731 --> 35:26.211
from your
savings and loan days.

35:26.298 --> 35:29.866
And who would light a fire
on such a warm morning?

35:29.953 --> 35:32.304
The hard part
was to figure out

35:32.391 --> 35:35.307
what would drive you to kill
the man who saved your life?

35:37.309 --> 35:39.528
'Then I realized that
firefighter saw something'

35:39.615 --> 35:41.530
'when he braved those
flames to rescue you.'

35:41.617 --> 35:43.576
I've got an unconscious
man in here.

35:43.663 --> 35:46.100
[Patrick]
'Something that would
send you to jail for life'

35:46.187 --> 35:48.407
'when he caught the news
reports of the robbery'

35:48.494 --> 35:51.801
'and pieced together what he saw
inside that burning house.'

35:57.851 --> 35:59.983
The mask. It had to be.

36:00.070 --> 36:02.769
It's what you were trying
to burn with those bank bags.

36:02.856 --> 36:04.771
It's what Satterfield saw
in your bedroom

36:04.858 --> 36:06.773
and that's why
you had to kill him

36:08.905 --> 36:09.863
[knife slices]

36:11.952 --> 36:13.736
[grunting]

36:16.391 --> 36:17.914
That's a scary story.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.482
But without proof,
it's just a story.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.441
Oh, almost forgot

36:22.528 --> 36:25.139
the other thing
I found in the ashes.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.098
Yeah.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.231
I searched your house
before you did, remember?

36:30.318 --> 36:31.972
I actually tried
to crack your safe.

36:32.059 --> 36:34.453
It's not my specialty.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.542
Don't worry.
I'm not here to bust you.

36:36.629 --> 36:41.286
There's nothing in that for me.
I want half the money.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.461
Half the money.

36:42.548 --> 36:45.377
Well, I think
that's very generous.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.857
I could ask for more.
What choice do youhave?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.828
[clears throat]

37:01.915 --> 37:03.612
[unzips bag]

37:14.057 --> 37:15.102
Half.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.370
Now the mask.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.764
Uh, yeah. The mask.
Of course, yes.

37:24.851 --> 37:26.548
You can have that there.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.605
Wait. This isn't mine.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.955
No. I found that
at a Mexican party store.

37:42.042 --> 37:44.610
The colors are a good match,
though, don't you think?

37:44.697 --> 37:46.133
Hands in the air.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.265
Do it now!

37:47.352 --> 37:49.615
[siren wailing]

37:54.272 --> 37:55.534
Turn around.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.284
[indistinct chattering]

38:06.371 --> 38:08.460
I've always wanted
a couch like that.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.418
Who's this?

38:10.505 --> 38:13.291
Oh, this is my responsible
adult, Tamara.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.335
Ta-mara.

38:14.422 --> 38:17.338
Hi.
Hi.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.079
Well, you did it.

38:19.166 --> 38:22.517
You caught a killer, and we got
back most of the stolen cash.

38:22.604 --> 38:24.345
Most?

38:24.432 --> 38:26.129
Wilcox was missing
some of the money.

38:26.216 --> 38:28.915
He said you took it,
but we didn't believe it.

38:29.002 --> 38:30.873
Hmm.
I'd look for an accomplice.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.789
That's a big job
to pull off alone.

38:33.876 --> 38:35.008
We'll do that.

38:35.095 --> 38:37.619
Oh, by the way.

38:37.706 --> 38:38.620
Your last paycheck.

38:42.972 --> 38:44.887
That's my payment?

38:44.974 --> 38:47.325
You weren't exactly
in it for the money.

38:47.412 --> 38:48.848
I'll confess
to a vague satisfaction

38:48.935 --> 38:50.240
in taking down someone

38:50.328 --> 38:52.025
that thought they were
smarter than me.

38:52.112 --> 38:54.941
But not enough
to wanna stick around here.

38:55.028 --> 38:57.683
Alright. Well, let me know
if you change your mind

38:57.770 --> 38:59.249
or, you know, get it back.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.860
Some doors
are best left shut.

39:00.947 --> 39:04.167
Uh, everyone else, I'd just
like to say thank you.

39:04.254 --> 39:07.780
I'm sure we've shared
some great times together.

39:07.867 --> 39:09.651
I'm not presently
qualified to comment,

39:09.738 --> 39:12.437
so I'm just gonna make
like a rock and roll.

39:12.524 --> 39:13.525
Bye.

39:16.441 --> 39:19.052
Wait.

39:19.139 --> 39:20.183
That looks real.

39:20.270 --> 39:21.315
Sure does.

39:21.402 --> 39:22.708
[chuckling]

39:22.795 --> 39:23.839
Mmm.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.841
Youweren't lying.

39:25.928 --> 39:27.190
Huh.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.236
You took it.

39:29.323 --> 39:34.546
Wilcox wasn't lying.
You really took it.

39:34.633 --> 39:37.113
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.900
I'm late for my new life.

39:40.987 --> 39:42.380
When did you grab
the cash?

39:43.859 --> 39:45.339
Oh, please,
does it really matter?

39:45.426 --> 39:47.341
I mean, you people are
the highway robbers.

39:47.428 --> 39:48.386
Look at this paycheck!

39:48.473 --> 39:50.344
We could have you arrested.

39:50.431 --> 39:53.913
No one can convict me.
I'm out of my mind.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.131
Ask my doctor.

39:55.218 --> 39:56.655
You're running away.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.352
What are you talking about?

39:58.439 --> 39:59.875
You're starting to feel
something inside

39:59.962 --> 40:01.921
and you don't know
what to do.

40:02.008 --> 40:03.139
That's nonsense.

40:03.226 --> 40:05.228
Prove it.
Take a ride with me.

40:05.315 --> 40:07.579
If you still wanna leave
after that, you can.

40:26.902 --> 40:28.121
[car door closes]

40:29.644 --> 40:32.560
Great house.
Whose is it?

40:32.647 --> 40:34.562
It's yours.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.782
Give me your keys.

40:36.869 --> 40:38.348
Okay.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.264
[keys jangle, lock turning]

40:41.351 --> 40:42.309
[chuckling]

40:46.705 --> 40:48.620
[slow instrumental music]

41:15.037 --> 41:16.604
[music continues]

41:34.796 --> 41:36.624
[music continues]

42:00.605 --> 42:01.736
I'm sorry.
