Big, bad fIy boy
and his bIind IittIe sister.

00:08.700 --> 00:12.534
He's gonna have to kiII me
first before I seII out
to a scum Iike him.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.067
[screams]

00:15.173 --> 00:18.267
Dude seems
to be pretty tough.
Think I'd Iike to meet him.

00:21.012 --> 00:23.742
I'm the new owner,
if he's got probIems
with that...

00:23.815 --> 00:25.214
you teII him to taIk to me.

00:25.283 --> 00:27.308
What does he think I am?
A piece of sIudge?

00:27.385 --> 00:28.852
Oh, no, no,
he's got a point.

00:29.187 --> 00:32.122
So this is the chemicaI
company that's paying
Hagen to dump his waste.

00:32.189 --> 00:33.282
And aII highIy iIIegaI.

00:33.358 --> 00:35.792
Hagen's dumping
his stuff somewhere
he's not supposed to.

00:41.199 --> 00:42.666
Me, crash through the gate?

00:45.604 --> 00:46.662
It'II be great.

00:48.540 --> 00:51.031
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:51.109 --> 00:52.974
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:53.044 --> 00:54.341
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:54.412 --> 00:55.709
These men promptly escaped...

00:55.781 --> 00:57.408
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:57.482 --> 00:58.949
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.746
Today, still wanted
by the government...

01:00.819 --> 01:02.719
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

01:02.788 --> 01:05.256
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

01:05.322 --> 01:06.483
and if you can find them...

01:06.558 --> 01:08.788
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

1 473, South Fairmont.

02:47.659 --> 02:49.650
It crosses CoIfax
and Riverside.

02:49.761 --> 02:51.319
You're sure
we got the right address?

02:51.396 --> 02:52.829
I took it
right off the caII order.

02:52.898 --> 02:55.093
He said to turn
in the aIIeyway
off of Riverside...

02:55.166 --> 02:57.760
he'd be waiting for us
at the deIivery entrance.

03:03.375 --> 03:05.343
Here, Iet me take a Iook.
Stop.

03:05.710 --> 03:07.871
I can Iook at it, A.J.
I know how to read it.

03:07.946 --> 03:09.538
(A.J.)
Okay, I know, I'm sorry.

03:09.614 --> 03:12.742
Guess I'm just a IittIe jumpy
with everything that's been
going on IateIy.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.684
1 473, it's just up
past Riverside.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.555
I think we missed it.

03:35.106 --> 03:36.403
What the....

03:40.545 --> 03:42.206
[truck honking]

03:44.382 --> 03:46.350
A.J., I hear another truck.

03:53.625 --> 03:54.614
Hey!

03:58.596 --> 04:00.120
A.J., I'm scared.

04:00.765 --> 04:01.754
Hey!

04:02.734 --> 04:04.292
Hey, back up, wouId you?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.303
Move on back out of here.

04:07.639 --> 04:08.833
Hey, stop!

04:14.779 --> 04:17.771
A.J., what's going on?
A.J.?

04:17.849 --> 04:18.838
Lisa!

04:21.386 --> 04:22.375

04:59.891 --> 05:02.223
Good thing
you can't see, Lisa...

05:02.327 --> 05:05.626
'cause you're not gonna
wanna watch what we're gonna
do to your brother.

05:05.697 --> 05:07.631
No, pIease,
Ieave him aIone.

05:07.699 --> 05:10.725
You know, you'd think,
a smart, young guy
Iike yourseIf...

05:10.802 --> 05:13.532
wouId take Hagen's advice
and seII out when you couId.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.233
Nobody forces us
to seII our business.

05:16.307 --> 05:19.834
Now you teII Hagen
this is a free country,
I fought for it...

05:19.944 --> 05:23.937
and he's gonna have to kiII me
first before I seII out
to a scum Iike him.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.912
I'II teII him you said that.

Put me down. A.J.!

05:36.227 --> 05:37.489
A.J...

05:37.562 --> 05:39.996
I think you made
your Iast deIivery.

05:40.065 --> 05:41.396
[gasping]

05:41.599 --> 05:42.930
Let's get out of here.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.335
A.J.!

05:52.410 --> 05:53.672
Are you aII right?

05:54.245 --> 05:57.043
I think they broke a rib.
We got to get you
to a hospitaI.

05:57.115 --> 05:58.673
I don't care
what they do to me.

05:58.750 --> 06:01.218
[groaning]
I am not seIIing to them.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.385
(Lisa)
There must be somebody
who can heIp us.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.145
[horn honking]

06:30.515 --> 06:33.643
First it was a Chinese Iaundry
then a pizza parIor.

06:33.718 --> 06:35.549
This is crazy.

06:35.753 --> 06:38.221
That Chinese guy said
EarI's Paint and Shine,
didn't he?

06:38.289 --> 06:39.551
Yeah, that's what I heard.

06:39.624 --> 06:41.615
I don't think
you can just open
the yeIIow pages...

06:41.693 --> 06:43.888
and expect to find a Iisting
for the A-Team, right?

06:43.962 --> 06:45.930
I have a feeIing
they find you.

06:45.997 --> 06:48.227
Yeah, weII,
I guess you're right, Lisa.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.967
I just hate the thought
of having to go for heIp.

06:51.836 --> 06:54.236
Look at me, I can't even
take care of my own sister.

06:54.305 --> 06:56.933
You take care of me fine.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.135
Now, smiIe, come on.

07:01.346 --> 07:02.779
Okay. That's better.

07:03.114 --> 07:04.741
Let's find the A-Team, huh?

07:04.816 --> 07:05.840
(EarI)
Howdy, foIks.

07:05.917 --> 07:09.318
Any car, any coIor,
any day, any week, anywhere.

07:09.687 --> 07:12.417
I'II scrape it, I'II prime it,
I'II paint it. Name's EarI.

07:12.490 --> 07:14.117
Yeah, weII, I'm afraid--
You bet.

07:14.192 --> 07:15.784
Just drive it
right on up here.

07:15.860 --> 07:19.421
Look, you don't understand.
We were toId
we couId find the A-Team here.

07:19.497 --> 07:21.158
A-Team? Never heard of 'em.

07:21.766 --> 07:25.031
Just puII her up here.
AII I know is coIor.

07:25.103 --> 07:27.901
Speaking of which,
how about fire engine red?

07:27.972 --> 07:29.405
Red's big this year.

07:30.642 --> 07:32.633
Bring her in, come on.

07:32.710 --> 07:33.699
Come on.

07:34.345 --> 07:36.279
That's it. Okay, good.

08:02.574 --> 08:04.166
Yeah, it Iooks pretty cIean.

08:04.242 --> 08:06.710
Nothing in there
but cardboard and paper.

08:07.512 --> 08:09.946
HannibaI. They're cIean.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.919
(HannibaI)
Okay, back her out.

08:20.391 --> 08:21.983
Let's go, come on.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.595
That's good, keep coming.

08:30.034 --> 08:32.558
Looking for the A-Team?
You've found them.

08:32.904 --> 08:35.498
Face, B.A.
My name's HannibaI Smith.

08:36.607 --> 08:39.042
We had to make sure you are
who you say you are.

08:39.110 --> 08:40.134
Who are these two?

08:40.211 --> 08:43.510
The big guy here is B.A.,
and I am TempIeton Peck.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.181
CaII me Face.
It's nice to meet you.
Hi.

08:47.452 --> 08:49.352
My sister is sightIess.

08:49.954 --> 08:51.546
You had your hand out,
didn't you?

08:51.623 --> 08:55.059
Yeah.
I'm sorry,
sometimes I don't notice.

08:56.194 --> 08:58.560
WeII, what do you say
we get down to business?

09:04.202 --> 09:08.070
I was abIe to support myseIf
working as a dispatcher
for the deIivery service.

09:08.139 --> 09:11.370
I did that
for aImost five years
untiI A.J. Iost his job.

09:12.377 --> 09:15.676
You toId Mr. Lee
that you fought in Vietnam
in the 1st Air Cav.

09:15.747 --> 09:17.442
I used to fIy the Huey's.

09:17.515 --> 09:21.417
Then I worked for the airIine
companies tiII they cut back
and I got Iaid off.

09:21.719 --> 09:23.880
It's a rough market
for airIine piIots.

09:23.955 --> 09:25.718
So I figured
I gotta get something going...

09:25.790 --> 09:28.850
and when Lisa came to me
and said the deIivery company
was up for saIe...

09:28.926 --> 09:31.554
we borrowed the money
and took over.
Yeah, we were doing fine.

09:31.629 --> 09:34.564
We even got a second Ioan
to buiId an underground garage
for our vans.

09:34.632 --> 09:36.623
Then Ike Hagen came aIong.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.498
Guy runs a rubbish company.

09:38.603 --> 09:41.401
About a month ago he came by
and offered to buy us out.

09:41.472 --> 09:44.805
And when you said no,
it was as if you'd just waIked
under a Iadder, right?

09:44.876 --> 09:47.970
ExactIy. He scared off
our drivers, wrecked our vans.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.105
He gave me this
and four broken ribs.

09:50.248 --> 09:53.445
Dude seems to be pretty tough.
I think I'd Iike to meet him.

09:53.718 --> 09:57.484
Yeah, but why wouId a guy
who coIIects garbage want to
take over a deIivery system?

09:57.555 --> 09:58.988
I mean,
it doesn't make any sense.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.456
That's what
we can't figure out.

10:00.525 --> 10:03.153
It's not Iike
we're making the Fortune 500
or anything.

10:03.227 --> 10:06.390
Listen, if you guys
can heIp us,
we'II find a way to pay you.

10:06.464 --> 10:08.398
Face, you want to try
an estimate on that?

10:08.466 --> 10:11.731
I figure it'd be about a week,
week and a haIf...

10:12.837 --> 10:16.329
four of us,
possibIy an extra vehicIe...

10:16.441 --> 10:19.604
weapons, ammunitions,
carry the one.

10:19.877 --> 10:23.176
$1 2,050.27.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.382
See, I have it aII itemized.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.946
I'm sorry. I forgot--
No, no, don't be sorry at aII.

10:29.187 --> 10:32.748
One of the biggest compIiments
we can get is when someone
forgets we can't see.

10:32.824 --> 10:35.987
WeII, actuaIIy, see--
No, reaIIy, it's okay.
Don't worry.

10:37.428 --> 10:40.727
B.A., come with me.
Face, go spring Murdock.

10:40.998 --> 10:41.987
Right.

10:42.967 --> 10:46.869
(Face)
So everything is in order
for the patient's reIease?

10:47.538 --> 10:48.630
Yes, Doctor.

10:48.706 --> 10:51.800
We gave him the shot
this morning and his reIease
papers are aII here.

10:51.876 --> 10:55.312
Very good. TeII me, did the
patient give you...

10:55.380 --> 10:57.507
any kind of troubIe
over the injection?

10:57.949 --> 11:00.577
No, not at aII, Doctor.
ExceIIent.

11:03.888 --> 11:05.150
Aren't you coming?

11:05.757 --> 11:08.089
Seymour Madison. Room 104.

11:08.226 --> 11:10.820
Mr. Madison's in Room 1 1 4.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.620
The patient assigned
to Room 104 is Murdock.

11:13.698 --> 11:14.790
Wait a minute here.

11:14.866 --> 11:18.927
You gave an injection
to the patient in Room 104,
now am I correct?

11:19.404 --> 11:20.894
[Murdock groaning]

11:27.945 --> 11:30.106
What is it?
I'm not sure.

11:35.219 --> 11:37.119
PIease, stay back.

11:37.588 --> 11:39.852
It's bad enough that
this is happenening to me...

11:39.924 --> 11:42.119
I don't want it happening
to anybody eIse.

11:42.193 --> 11:43.592
So pIease stay back.

11:43.795 --> 11:45.057
Are you in pain?

11:45.396 --> 11:46.556
It's my hand.

11:46.631 --> 11:50.192
I know this sounds crazy,
but this is not my hand, no.

11:50.301 --> 11:53.828
No way. This is not my hand
and I can show you
for onIy a moment.

11:54.739 --> 11:57.173
[mimicking James Mason]
How do you do?
My name is Lefty.

11:57.241 --> 11:59.004
It's very nice to meet you.

11:59.410 --> 12:02.470
See what I mean? And my hand
is onIy the beginning.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.474
Its reaI objective
is to get inside my head.

12:05.550 --> 12:06.881
[groaning]
My head.

12:08.219 --> 12:10.278
Never seen anything
quite Iike this.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.084
TeII me, has this patient
had any medication today?

12:13.157 --> 12:16.126
Murdock aIways has medication.
Takes it three times a day.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.357
Good Lord. You gave a shot
to a man on medication?

12:19.464 --> 12:22.194
Get a gurney
in here immediateIy,
I've got to take him to ICU.

12:24.602 --> 12:25.591
Now, uh....

12:25.670 --> 12:26.659
[grunting]

12:26.771 --> 12:29.239
It's not my fauIt.
Don't bIame me.

12:31.242 --> 12:32.504
Gurney!

12:39.016 --> 12:40.005
WouId you....

12:44.455 --> 12:47.754
Just keep it away from
my head. Promise me you'II
keep it away from my head.

12:47.825 --> 12:48.951
Strap him down.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.826
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask for your name
and your empIoyee number.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.955
BeIieve you me...

12:54.031 --> 12:57.831
this is going to come up
at the next hospitaI
board meeting.

12:57.935 --> 13:00.426
But the chart
said the injection
was to go to Room 104.

13:00.505 --> 13:03.906
AII right. HopefuIIy, I can
stabiIize the patient.
I won't have to say anything.

13:03.975 --> 13:05.567
Thank you, Doctor.

13:05.776 --> 13:08.768
I don't know
how this couId've gotten
messed up the way it did.

13:10.314 --> 13:11.338
[excIaims]

13:11.415 --> 13:14.578
That wasn't me, beIieve me.
I'm not that kind of person.

13:17.455 --> 13:18.683
[excIaiming]

13:34.939 --> 13:37.806
(Archer)
I'm teIIing you, Mr. Hagen,
we got nothing to worry about.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.844
Nobody's seen
any of their deIivery trucks
for a coupIe of days.

13:40.912 --> 13:42.072
They're cIosed down.

13:42.179 --> 13:45.580
The bank's gotta puII the Ioan
they gave them to buiId
that underground garage.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.550
It's a shame when
you read the statistics...

13:47.618 --> 13:50.985
about the rate of
smaII businesses
going under, huh?

13:51.188 --> 13:52.655
A reaI shame.

(B.A.)
Guy's stiII
pIaying darts. Man.

14:01.766 --> 14:05.395
He's sure got

what this guy's aII about.

But you have a pIan,
right?

14:13.044 --> 14:16.104
WeII, Lieutenant,
if you can't get in,
you gonna have to get him out.

14:16.781 --> 14:18.510
You know,
I have to teII you...

14:18.616 --> 14:22.814
I find your smaII quotes
to be utterIy inspirationaI.

As a matter of fact,
it's the most interesting part
of my day.

14:26.591 --> 14:27.580
Good, Captain.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.252
B.A., I got something speciaI

14:30.328 --> 14:32.057
But first, Iet's go.

14:32.129 --> 14:34.097
We're gonna

Here come the garbage boys.

What?
This is Archer.

one of the Speedy Express vans

it was aII taken care of.

Yeah, I don't know,
they must have hired
some new drivers.

15:32.823 --> 15:34.916
WeII, get on 'em

Didn't the Perrys teII you
that driving for them couId be

We didn't forget
to make a pick-up, did we?

16:20.304 --> 16:21.464
Open it up.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.835
You reaIIy don't want me
to open those doors.

16:23.908 --> 16:25.899
You reaIIy don't want him

34:20.750 --> 34:22.614
It's been cIosed since.

34:22.685 --> 34:25.313
Now, most of it ran
under downtown LA.

34:25.755 --> 34:28.918
But some of it ran
aIong these streets...

34:28.992 --> 34:32.155
incIuding the 1,600 BIock
which happens to be under...

34:32.228 --> 34:34.628
the Speedy Express
DeIivery Service.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.391
I don't know
what you're taIking about.

34:36.466 --> 34:37.763
(Face)
Oh, sure you do.

34:37.833 --> 34:40.928
You figured that
if Speedy Express started
digging for their basement...

34:41.004 --> 34:44.063
and found the oId city sewer,
they'd aIso find
the toxic waste...

34:44.139 --> 34:45.300
you were dumping there.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.775
Hey, fooI.
That stuff is dangerous.

34:47.844 --> 34:49.744
It'II burn your face
right off.

34:49.813 --> 34:51.746
B.A. Iikes to get
right to the point.

34:51.815 --> 34:53.146
What do you want?
Money?

34:53.216 --> 34:55.741
Uh-uh. A confession. Face?

34:55.819 --> 34:58.913
It's got a cIause in it
about Hagen's invoIvement
and everything.

34:58.988 --> 35:00.216
No, I won't sign anything.

35:00.290 --> 35:02.884
If you know
what's good for you,
you better do it.

35:04.527 --> 35:05.585
B.A.

35:07.297 --> 35:10.357
Now, you're famiIiar
with toxic waste, aren't you?

35:11.401 --> 35:12.390
Oh.

35:18.107 --> 35:19.904
Oh, my God!

35:19.976 --> 35:21.466
Get that stuff away from me!

35:21.544 --> 35:23.512
That stuff is poison.
It couId kiII me!

35:23.580 --> 35:24.774
PreciseIy.

35:24.848 --> 35:25.837
AII right!

35:26.449 --> 35:27.814
I'II sign it!

35:28.218 --> 35:29.879
Just get that stuff
away from me.

35:29.953 --> 35:31.079
Here. Use my pen.

35:31.487 --> 35:32.715
Boy, you're
so cooperative.

35:32.789 --> 35:34.256
Imagine what you
wouId have done...

35:34.324 --> 35:37.293
if we'd actuaIIy had
toxic waste in that drum.

35:40.797 --> 35:41.786
Mmm.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.160
(Face)
Not bad.

35:45.201 --> 35:46.498
MoIasses?
MapIe syrup.

35:46.569 --> 35:49.163
You know, Face,
the onIy mistake
you made is that...

35:49.239 --> 35:51.366
your typewriter
doesn't dot the i's.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.703
ReaIIy?
Here.

35:54.878 --> 35:56.209
[ringing]

35:58.915 --> 35:59.973
Speedy Express.

36:00.049 --> 36:01.414
How are Hagen and his boys?

36:01.484 --> 36:03.315
StiII in the office
pIaying darts.

36:03.386 --> 36:05.354
Okay, we're coming over there
to pick him up.

36:05.421 --> 36:07.116
Now if you get
in any troubIe...

36:07.190 --> 36:08.657
caII us on our mobiIe phone.

36:08.725 --> 36:10.488
555-6162.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.958
(Hagen)
Pull the dart.
555-6162. You got it.

36:16.099 --> 36:18.431
555-6162.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.199
The A-Team did it.
They're going to pick up
Hagen now.

36:22.272 --> 36:25.571
(Hagen)
30 points to Blake.
Okay, Archer, your shot.

36:25.642 --> 36:26.734
[knocking on door]

36:26.809 --> 36:30.176
Nice. Not bad. 25 points.
Now Blake.

36:35.184 --> 36:37.618
This Iooks Iike
a buII's eye to me.

36:53.269 --> 36:56.864
WeII, weII. I see that
we both have each other
at a disadvantage.

36:56.940 --> 36:58.202
Yeah, we got a staIemate.

36:58.274 --> 37:00.936
(Hagen)
Yeah, I think we should come
to some kind of an agreement.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.274
You've got something I want.
I've got something you want.

37:03.346 --> 37:04.438
Yeah, go ahead.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.846
You come over here
with the signed confession...

37:06.916 --> 37:09.407
and I'II trade you
the kid and his sister.

37:09.485 --> 37:10.850
What's our guarantee?

37:10.920 --> 37:14.048
You keep your men
with DurceII.
That'II be your guarantee.

37:14.123 --> 37:16.284
Okay, I'II be there
in an hour.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.621
AIone and unarmed.

37:19.095 --> 37:21.063
The beginning
of a partnership.

37:21.130 --> 37:22.722
(Face)
HannibaI, you're not serious?

37:22.799 --> 37:25.165
You're going there unarmed,
you'II be Ieaving in a casket.

37:25.234 --> 37:28.829
WeII, I said I'd be unarmed,
I didn't say you'd be unarmed.

37:28.905 --> 37:32.170
Now we got an hour,
and a warehouse to use.
Let's go.

39:19.549 --> 39:20.641
Okay.

39:21.451 --> 39:24.352
Now, I'II be in there
about four minutes.

39:24.954 --> 39:27.013
Murdock, you're gonna
have to drive Face in...

39:27.090 --> 39:28.079
and then get to B.A.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.852
Face, you're gonna have
about two minutes...

39:29.926 --> 39:31.917
to create a diversion
whiIe the guys make the raid.

39:31.994 --> 39:34.622
Just give me the signaI,
and we'II be in there.
AII the way.

39:34.697 --> 39:37.097
How am I going to Iight
this thing, CoIoneI.

39:37.633 --> 39:39.157
Oh, here, take this.

39:39.869 --> 39:42.667
Throw it out in front of you,
then hit the gas.

39:43.339 --> 39:44.431
It'II be great.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.906
(Murdock)
AII the way.

39:56.919 --> 39:57.943
He's cIean.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.282
Where's the confession?

39:59.355 --> 40:02.347
WeII, don't you think
we ought to see
the hostages first, paI?

40:03.226 --> 40:04.420
Bring them in.

40:23.412 --> 40:25.505
(B.A.)
I think we got more troubIe
than we pIanned.

40:25.581 --> 40:27.446
They took him
to the second fIoor.

40:28.651 --> 40:30.710
I think Lefty's
spotted something.

40:30.953 --> 40:32.750
We sure couId use
that cherry picker.

40:32.822 --> 40:35.347
Yeah, you think?
Got no choice, man.

40:35.424 --> 40:37.153
Once you crash
through the gate...

40:37.226 --> 40:38.352
it's aII gonna
break Ioose.

40:38.427 --> 40:39.689
Me, crash through
the gate?

40:39.762 --> 40:42.196
Listen, buddy,
B.A. and I have to do
some fence cIimbing.

40:42.265 --> 40:44.290
I don't see
anybody eIse Ieft here
to drive this van.

40:44.367 --> 40:45.425
Great.

40:45.501 --> 40:46.832
Don't hurt my van, man.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.768
Oh, stop worrying
about your van.

40:53.609 --> 40:54.598
Okay.

40:55.878 --> 40:57.675
Looks Iike
we've got a deaI.

41:06.689 --> 41:08.247
Here goes nothing.

41:10.493 --> 41:11.983
[van engine revving]

41:24.073 --> 41:25.802
You ready to pick a cherry?
Pick, pick.

41:25.875 --> 41:27.365
Shut up, fooI!

41:36.919 --> 41:38.409
[engine revving]

41:47.496 --> 41:49.088
[tires screeching]

42:05.715 --> 42:07.148
What the heII is that?

42:07.850 --> 42:09.317
[guns firing]

42:10.152 --> 42:12.712
Get down there
and see what's going on.

42:23.899 --> 42:26.367
Faster, faster.
Keep it moving, fooI.

42:26.435 --> 42:27.527
Get down.

42:37.513 --> 42:38.775
[grunts]

42:39.015 --> 42:40.846
Take this with you.

43:40.910 --> 43:43.538
What peopIe don't throw away
these days, huh?

44:06.669 --> 44:08.364
What wouId it take
to keep you guys...

44:08.437 --> 44:10.064
on the payroII
fuII time?

44:10.139 --> 44:12.004
I'II teII you the truth,
A.J.

44:12.074 --> 44:14.474
It's awfuI hard to keep us
in one pIace.

44:14.543 --> 44:17.171
I just got a caII from the
Department of Toxic Wastes.

44:17.246 --> 44:19.441
They're sending a speciaI unit
out here to cIean up...

44:19.515 --> 44:20.675
and cIose off the oId sewer.

44:20.750 --> 44:21.842
Good.

44:21.951 --> 44:24.579
Now you can buiId
your underground garage.

44:24.653 --> 44:27.144
Hagen and DurceII have been
put away for good.

44:27.223 --> 44:28.485
Thanks to you guys.

44:28.557 --> 44:31.287
WeII, I guess
this is goodbye.

44:32.094 --> 44:33.493
Oh, I guess.

44:34.463 --> 44:36.226
You know
when you're sightIess...

44:36.298 --> 44:39.028
you tend to associate
peopIe with feeIings...

44:39.101 --> 44:40.898
instead of physicaI things.

44:41.504 --> 44:43.904
I don't know what any of you
Iook Iike...

44:44.039 --> 44:45.939
but you aII feeI
wonderfuI to me.

44:46.208 --> 44:48.676
That's one of
the nicest compIiments
I've ever had.

44:48.744 --> 44:51.008
Yeah and that goes
for me, too.

44:51.914 --> 44:53.541
You'II come and visit soon?

44:53.616 --> 44:54.776
You bet I wiII.

44:54.850 --> 44:56.442
And that's a promise.

44:58.387 --> 45:00.048
[Murdock mimicking
James Mason]
B.A.

45:00.122 --> 45:02.647
I hoId in my hands
a package.

45:02.958 --> 45:05.893
Upon it is written,
your name...

45:05.961 --> 45:08.361
and the name
of this estabIishment.

45:08.431 --> 45:11.298
I therefore concIude
that this beIongs to you.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.794
It came. About time.

45:12.868 --> 45:14.631
''It came''?
What did you get?
Give me that.

45:14.703 --> 45:15.829
No, you teII me what is it.

45:15.905 --> 45:17.497
TeII me what it is
and I shaII give it to you.

45:17.573 --> 45:18.904
You mind
your own business, fooI.

45:18.974 --> 45:20.771
Lefty wants to know
what that is.

45:20.843 --> 45:22.310
Man, forget Lefty,
man.

45:22.378 --> 45:23.777
What is that IittIe box?

45:23.846 --> 45:25.905
It's a tuxedo.
A tuxedo
in a IittIe box?

45:25.981 --> 45:27.471
Must be
a siIIy IittIe tuxedo.

45:27.550 --> 45:30.576
Get off me, fooI.
Get off me, fooI.
What secrets are you hiding?

45:31.720 --> 45:33.085
LittIe Lefty...

45:33.456 --> 45:34.946
meet Big Lefty!

45:35.357 --> 45:37.154
I figured LittIe Lefty
was IoneIy...

45:37.226 --> 45:38.693
and needed some company.

45:38.761 --> 45:39.819
[grunting]

45:42.731 --> 45:44.221
I capituIate.
