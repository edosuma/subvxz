00:12.312 --> 00:13.880
- THANK YOU, GOD.

00:13.913 --> 00:15.949
I DON'T THINK 2.9
IS YOUR LOWEST.

00:15.982 --> 00:17.350

IS YOUR HIGHEST.

00:17.384 --> 00:18.651
HE CAN PUSH ME AROUND
ALL HE WANTS,

00:18.685 --> 00:20.020
BUT I'M GONNA GET
THE LAST LAUGH.

- LOOK ME IN THE EYE, MAN.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.747

HI, SWEDEN.
I'M HOME.

01:09.369 --> 01:10.937
WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW
ABOUT ME IS THAT

01:10.970 --> 01:13.406
I'M NOT ONLY ONE OF THE TOP
BROKERS IN NEW YORK CITY,

01:13.440 --> 01:15.775
I HAVE A SECOND BUSINESS,
MY OWN COMPANY,

01:15.809 --> 01:17.410
CALLED EKLUND STOCKHOLM
NEW YORK,

01:17.444 --> 01:19.145
BACK IN SWEDEN.

01:22.949 --> 01:26.586
IN SWEDEN, I HAVE A FULL STAFF
THAT I MANAGE FROM NEW YORK.

01:26.619 --> 01:29.489
MY COMPANY IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE
BROKERAGE IN SWEDEN.

01:29.522 --> 01:32.692
ACTUALLY, NO OTHER BROKERAGE
IN ALL OF SCANDINAVIA

01:32.726 --> 01:35.095
HAS MORE LISTINGS
OVER $1 MILLION.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.769
I GO TO SWEDEN
AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.571
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO MEET MY BROKERS.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.439
I THINK IT'S GOOD
FOR THEIR MORALE.

01:46.473 --> 01:47.640
I WISH FROM THE BOTTOM
OF MY HEART

01:47.674 --> 01:49.209

IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR ME
TO REPRESENT THE BRAND

IN STOCKHOLM.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.754
- COMING EXCLUSIVELY
FROM NEW YORK,

02:00.787 --> 02:02.555
MR. FREDRIK EKLUND.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.060
- NOW, THERE'S SOME
BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

02:07.060 --> 02:10.130
BEING A BROKER
IN SWEDEN AND IN NEW YORK.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.831
IN NEW YORK,
TO GET YOUR LICENSE

02:11.865 --> 02:14.768
IS A VERY QUICK PROCESS--
TWO, THREE WEEKS.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.070
IN SWEDEN,
IT'S TWO OR THREE YEARS.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.972
I HAVE SO MUCH WORK
IN FRONT OF ME.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.174
BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD

- WHAT? WHY AREN'T YOU
TAKING ME TO FLORIDA?

03:26.139 --> 03:28.842

I NEED TO GET AWAY
FROM IT ALL.

TAKE YOU TO SACKS?

03:41.354 --> 03:42.856
WHY DON'T I JUST
DO THIS, OKAY?

03:42.889 --> 03:44.924
TO MAKE LIFE MUCH EASIER
FOR ME,

03:44.958 --> 03:47.527
OKAY, GET THE SHOES
WITH THE RED HEELS.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.795
AND IF YOU--I SWEAR TO GOD,

I'VE ALWAYS LOVED SLIPPERS.

05:03.703 --> 05:04.904
I JUST LIKE--
THEY'RE DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.139
SLIPPERS ARE DIFFERENT
THAN SHOES.

05:06.172 --> 05:07.307
YOU GET A LITTLE FUNNY DESIGN.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.408
THEY'RE REALLY COMFORTABLE.

05:08.441 --> 05:09.409
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WEAR SOCKS.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.077
I HATE WEARING SOCKS.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.912

05:20.687 --> 05:21.921
I MEAN, IF YOU
THINK ABOUT IT,

05:21.955 --> 05:23.623
IT'S LESS SHOE THAN
MOST OTHER PEOPLE GET.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.925
NOW, CAN I TRY THEM ON
WITHOUT SOCKS?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.560
BECAUSE I WEAR THEM
WITHOUT SOCKS.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.728

06:42.168 --> 06:43.970
THERE'S NO NEW CONSTRUCTION,

IS THAT STOCKHOLM AND MANHATTAN

06:55.181 --> 06:57.317
IS ALMOST PRICED THE SAME.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.753
BECAUSE OF THE EXCHANGE RATE
AND THE WEAK DOLLAR,

06:59.786 --> 07:02.589
PEOPLE ARE SO SURPRISED
HOW EXPENSIVE STOCKHOLM IS.

07:02.622 --> 07:03.590
HELLO.

07:03.623 --> 07:06.226
[raps on glass]

07:58.078 --> 07:59.713
CLOSET?

08:08.922 --> 08:11.257
SO I LOVE THE HOUSE.
GREAT JOB.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.259
CAN I ASK YOU WHAT
YOU PURCHASED IT FOR?

08:13.293 --> 08:15.729
- WE PURCHASED IT
FOR $1 MILLION.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.130
- $1 MILLION.
IF YOU BOUGHT IT

08:17.163 --> 08:18.398
FOR $1 MILLION
3 1/2 YEARS AGO,

08:18.431 --> 08:19.899
WHAT IS YOUR EXPECTATIONS?

08:19.933 --> 08:25.672
- I THOUGHT ABOUT, LIKE,
$1.5 MILLION, AT LEAST.

08:25.705 --> 08:28.742
- WHY DO YOU SAY 1.5?
I'M JUST CURIOUS TO HEAR.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.710
- IT'S UNIQUE.

08:30.744 --> 08:34.214
- THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT IT'S LACKING.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.950
YOU KNOW,
THE SECOND REAL BEDROOM.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.185
THE BABY'S ROOM IS FOR A BABY.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.521
SO WHERE WOULD YOU PUT
YOUR MOM OR YOUR BROTHER

08:41.554 --> 08:43.056
OR YOUR FRIENDS
WHEN THEY COME AND VISIT?

08:43.056 --> 08:45.358
- TH-THAT'S--THAT'S--
OF COURSE.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.459
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.061
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE NEGATIVE,

08:48.061 --> 08:49.262
BUT I, YOU KNOW...

08:49.295 --> 08:50.964
WE DON'T WANT TO DO YOU
A DISSERVICE EITHER

08:51.064 --> 08:52.565
BY GOING OUT TOO HIGH.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.534
BECAUSE YOU WON'T
HAVE ANY INTEREST.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.305
UM...

08:59.339 --> 09:01.074
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THIS
SHOULD BE LISTED FOR?

09:01.107 --> 09:03.777
- I THINK WE SHOULD LIST IT,
ACTUALLY, FOR 1.3.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.114
- I HAVE TO AGREE
WITH NIKLAUS.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.716
HE'S THE BEST BROKER
IN SWEDEN.

09:09.749 --> 09:11.685
LET'S GO AT 1.3.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.554
I'LL PERSONALLY BE HERE
AT THE OPEN HOUSE.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.289
- IF IT'S...

09:21.227 --> 09:23.263
- THE STRATEGY OF PRICING
IS REALLY THE SAME

09:23.296 --> 09:24.631
IN SWEDEN OR AMERICA.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.733
IT'S MORE A FUNCTION
OF THE MARKET

09:26.766 --> 09:27.867
AND THE STRENGTH OF IT.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.036
AND SWEDEN HAS
A VERY STRONG MARKET.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.772
IT KEEPS APPRECIATING EVERY YEAR
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS,

09:32.806 --> 09:35.075
AND WE HAVE A LOT
OF BIDDING WARS.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.643
IN NEW YORK,
IT'S A BIT TOUGHER.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.678
YOU'LL BE HAPPY IF YOU
GET TO LISTING PRICE.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.380
- I WANT YOU TO HEAR IT
FROM ME.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.915
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
DISAPPOINTED.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.783
WE WILL GET YOU MORE THAN 1.3.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.624
- OKAY.
WE DO THIS.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.093
- FANTASTIC.
- GREAT.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.729
- WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE UP.
WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

09:55.762 --> 09:59.132
DO I LOOK LIKE
A PERSON THAT GIVES UP?

09:59.165 --> 10:01.134
[laughter]

10:02.669 --> 10:04.804
- BIG QUESTION IS...
WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?

10:04.838 --> 10:05.872
- 35 MILLION.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.184
- HEY, MAN, CAN WE GO
TO GREENE STREET,

10:18.218 --> 10:19.786
BETWEEN SPRING AND PRINCE?

10:19.819 --> 10:21.855
FOR MY LISTING APPOINTMENT
WITH KEN,

10:21.888 --> 10:23.690
I'M BRINGING ALONG
MY FRIEND CAROLINE.

10:23.723 --> 10:26.659
AND EVEN THOUGH THE LISTING
IS MINE, WHEN I MET KEN,

10:26.693 --> 10:28.928
I'M PRETTY SURE THE ONLY REASON
HE TALKED TO ME

10:28.962 --> 10:30.663
WAS BECAUSE I WAS STANDING
NEXT TO CAROLINE.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.766
SO...YOU KNOW.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.701
BRINGING HER ALONG...

10:34.734 --> 10:36.036
CAN'T HURT.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.103
I THINK HE'S GON--

10:37.137 --> 10:38.171
I THINK HE'S GONNA
REALLY LIKE YOU.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.506
[both laugh]

10:41.207 --> 10:43.810
SOHO IS ONE OF THE MOST
DESIRABLE PLACES TO LIVE

10:43.843 --> 10:44.844
IN THE WORLD.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.212
- HERE WE ARE.

10:46.246 --> 10:49.416
THIS APARTMENT IS LINED
BY HIGH-FASHION STORES.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.818
YOU GOT Y3 AND ARMANI CASA
ON THE SAME BLOCK.

10:51.851 --> 10:54.921
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHEN YOU WALK
BY THESE OLD CAST IRON BUILDINGS

10:54.954 --> 10:56.790
LIKE JUST WHAT IS UP THERE.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.758
[knock on door]

10:58.792 --> 11:00.460
HEY.
- [chuckling]

11:00.493 --> 11:01.628
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.063
- HOW YOU DOING?

11:03.096 --> 11:04.197
- YOU REMEMBER CAROLINE.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.899
- HELLO.
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?

11:05.932 --> 11:08.234
VERY IMPRESSIVE DOORS.
- THANK YOU.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.669
- WHOA, YOU
WEREN'T KIDDING, HUH?

11:09.703 --> 11:11.204
- WOW.

11:11.237 --> 11:12.639
- YOU JUST LOOK UP.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.973
I MEAN, IT TAKES
YOUR BREATH AWAY.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.976
- THAT'S 36 FEET
STRAIGHT UP IN THE MIDDLE.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.345
- OH, WOW.
- WHOA.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.613
- I LOVE THE HIGH CEILINGS.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.782
THIS MIGHT BE THE COOLEST ROOM
IN ALL OF MANHATTAN.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.251
- I MEAN, PICTURES DON'T DO
THE PLACE JUSTICE.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.221
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
PRIVATE ROOMS

11:28.254 --> 11:29.222
THAT I'VE EVER SEEN.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.995
OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE YEARS,

11:36.096 --> 11:40.100
KEN BOUGHT THE FIVE PENTHOUSES
AROUND HIM,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.401
AND HE SLOWLY COMBINED,

11:41.434 --> 11:44.304
AND THEN HE BUILT UP
AND UP AND UP.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.672
SO THIS IS THE KITCHEN.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.274
PHILLIPE STARCK FELT
VERY STRONG ABOUT HAVING

11:48.308 --> 11:50.910
ATTACHED TO AN EXTERIOR SPACE.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.545
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL VIEW
OF GREENE STREET...

11:52.579 --> 11:53.546
- IT LOOKS OUT
ON GREENE STREET.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.948
- OUT HERE.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.783
- HOW MANY TERRACES IN TOTAL
DOES THE APARTMENT HAVE?

11:56.816 --> 11:57.984
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5--

11:58.018 --> 12:00.320
SIX DIFFERENT TERRACES.

12:06.493 --> 12:10.697
AND THEN, THROUGH THAT HALLWAY
YOU GO INTO ALL THE BEDROOMS.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.701
IT'S LIKE A PALACE IN THE SKY
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOHO.

12:14.734 --> 12:19.139
I THINK IT'S--IT'S AN APARTMENT
UNLIKE ANY OTHER.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.707
- SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.475
- YOU KNOW, I--I--

12:22.509 --> 12:24.611
I CONSIDER THIS
LIKE I MADE A SCULPTURE.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.079
I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE IT.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.914
I THINK I'D--
I'D LIKE TO START AGAIN

12:27.947 --> 12:29.416
AND SO SOMETHING ELSE.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.618
- SO THEN THE BIG QUESTION IS...

12:31.651 --> 12:32.652
WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?

12:32.686 --> 12:36.089
- WELL, I WOULD BE HAPPY...

12:36.122 --> 12:38.158
TO GET $35 MILLION.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.432
- I MEAN...

12:45.465 --> 12:47.167
- I'VE PUT SO MUCH BLOOD
INTO THIS PLACE.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.136
YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE
HAS COST ME A FORTUNE.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.940
- LOOK, I THINK IT'S TOUGH
TO PUT A PRICE ON...

12:53.973 --> 12:55.342
EMOTIONS.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.677
BUT I THINK
35 IS A STRETCH.

12:57.711 --> 12:59.179
- YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN GET THAT?

13:02.682 --> 13:04.050
- THE APARTMENT
IS STUNNING,

13:04.050 --> 13:06.386
BUT THE BUILDING JUST DOES NOT
JUSTIFY THAT PRICE.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.622
THERE'S NO DOORMAN.
NO LOBBY TO SPEAK OF, REALLY.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.057
UH, NO AMENITIES.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.525
AND PEOPLE SPENDING
THAT KIND OF MONEY

13:12.559 --> 13:14.427
EXPECT THOSE KIND
OF LUXURIES.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.830
- I THINK, IF WE PRICE IT
MORE IN LINE

13:16.863 --> 13:18.865
WITH WHERE THE AREA
COMPS OUT--

13:18.898 --> 13:22.869
SOHO, YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND
$2,000 TO $2,500 A FOOT.

13:22.902 --> 13:27.273
I THINK WE CAN MOVE THIS
CLOSER TO 25.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.412
- IF YOU ASK FOR 35,

13:32.445 --> 13:34.781
YOU MIGHT GET THAT ONE
PERSON FROM DUBAI

13:34.814 --> 13:36.349
WHO DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT MONEY.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.919
- MAYBE, BUT WE JUST MIGHT NOT
FIND THEM FOR TWO YEARS.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.492
- BUT WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU
TO COME IN HERE AND SELL THIS?

13:45.525 --> 13:48.094
I MEAN...
- THIS IS YOUR TROPHY.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.196
THIS--YOU PUT ALL YOUR LOVE
AND CARE INTO THIS.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.531
- RIGHT.
- I WILL DO THE SAME...

13:51.564 --> 13:52.632
IN SELLING IT.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.101
I'M TALKING
THE PRIVATE NETWORK.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.537
I'M TALKING THAT WE CAN
HAVE PARTIES IN HERE.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.473
- HOW DOES HAVING A PARTY HERE
HELP SELL THE PLACE?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.342
- INSTEAD OF HAVING
A SUNDAY OPEN HOUSE,

14:02.375 --> 14:04.878
YOU HAVE A PARTY THAT'S
FULL OF CELEBRITIES,

14:04.911 --> 14:06.146
THAT'S FULL OF SOCIALITES.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.048
EVEN IF THOSE PEOPLE
DON'T BUY IT,

14:08.048 --> 14:10.050
THEY SEE HOW AMAZING
THIS APARTMENT IS,

14:10.050 --> 14:12.452
AND THEY LEAVE
AND THEY TELL THEIR FRIENDS.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.486
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:13.520 --> 14:16.856
LIST IT FOR $25,000
AND WE GO HARD.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.527
- OKAY.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.337
YOU BETTER SELL THIS.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.339
- I'VE NEVER SOLD
A SINGLE APARTMENT

14:32.372 --> 14:33.907
AS EXPENSIVE
AS GREENE STREET.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.276
THIS WOULD BE THE BIGGEST SALE
OF MY CAREER.

14:36.309 --> 14:40.714
BUT WITH A GIGANTIC COMMISSION
COMES HUGE PRESSURE.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.750
- YOU GOTTA REALLY KICK BUTT
FOR ME HERE, OKAY?

14:43.783 --> 14:45.585
'CAUSE, UH--
- YOUR GRIP'S A LITTLE TIGHT.

14:45.618 --> 14:46.720
- OH, YEAH.
[laughter]

14:54.761 --> 14:56.363
- HEY, DAD.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.398
OH, YEAH, I'M RUNNING DOWN TO
THAT NEW TOWNHOUSE DOWNTOWN.

14:58.431 --> 15:03.136
33 CHARLTON IS IN WEST VILLAGE,
SOHO AREA OF NEW YORK.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.238
IT'S ON A REALLY
HISTORICAL STREET.

15:05.271 --> 15:08.708
THE AREA IS FULL OF AMAZING
EARLY FEDERAL ARCHITECTURE.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.577
IT'S ACTUALLY THE LONGEST
CONTINUOUS ROW

15:10.610 --> 15:12.245
OF THESE TYPES OF TOWNHOUSES.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.181
HEY, MICHAEL LORBER.
- HEY...WHAT'S UP?

15:15.215 --> 15:16.383
- COME ON IN.
- THANKS FOR HAVING ME TODAY.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.352
- COME ON IN.
LET ME SHOW YOU THE HOUSE.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.658
- DOUG IS INTO CHARLTON STREET
FOR APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.061
HE BOUGHT THE BUILDING
FOR $4 MILLION

15:28.094 --> 15:29.129
AND SPENT ABOUT $2 MILLION

15:29.162 --> 15:30.830
COMPLETELY RENOVATING
THE STRUCTURE

15:30.864 --> 15:33.266
TO MAKE IT LOOK
THE WAY IT DOES TODAY.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.935
- HERE'S THE FRONT BEDROOM.

15:35.969 --> 15:39.139
- I NOTICE MOST OF IT
IS FURNISHED.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.408
BUT THIS COULD USE SOME TLC
UP HERE, MAYBE.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.080
- WELL, WE DID
A GLASS FLOOR HERE

15:47.080 --> 15:51.851
TO JUST DIFFUSE THE LIGHT
DOWN THROUGH THE PROPERTY.

15:51.885 --> 15:54.320
PART OF THIS SYSTEM IS CALLED
THE VIRTUAL DOORMAN.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.990
- THE BEST PART ABOUT VIRTUAL
DOORMAN IS NO CHRISTMAS TIP.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.091
- [laughs]

16:02.062 --> 16:04.230
- SO YOU GUYS HAVE HAD IT
ON THE MARKET FOR NOW,

16:04.264 --> 16:06.032
WHAT, TWO YEARS?
- YES.

16:06.032 --> 16:08.034
- THIS TOWNHOUSE HAS BEEN
FOR SALE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.036
I'D SAY THREE OF THE BEST
BROKERS IN NEW YORK

16:10.036 --> 16:11.705
AHD IT FOR SALE
AT THE SAME TIME.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.240
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
ALL SO GREAT AND BUSY

16:14.274 --> 16:16.576
THAT THEY DIDN'T--I DON'T THINK
THEY FOCUSED ENOUGH ON IT.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.045
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO DIFFERENTLY

16:19.079 --> 16:20.914
THAN THE OTHER BROKERS DID?

16:20.947 --> 16:22.649
- YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE
VERY DIFFERENT THIS TIME,

16:22.682 --> 16:24.084
IF YOU GIVE ME THE LISTING.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.485
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
CALLING THREE BROKERS

16:25.518 --> 16:26.886
AND THEIR TEAM MEMBERS
AND THEIR ASSISTANTS

16:26.920 --> 16:30.156
AND THEIR SECRETARIES AND THEIR
THIS--IT'S JUST ME.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.058
- IF I CALL YOU,
I GET YOU.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.393
- YOU JUST NEED MY CELL PHONE.
THAT'S IT, YOU KNOW?

16:33.426 --> 16:34.427
- OKAY.
- TO TRACK ME DOWN.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.229
- THAT--THAT I LIKE.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.565
- I THINK RESTAGING IT
WOULD REALLY BRIGHTEN IT UP.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.967
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST NOT FINISHED NOW.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.836
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
BUILT-OUT KIDS' ROOMS

16:42.869 --> 16:44.704
WITH, YOU KNOW,
THE TOYS AND EVERY--

16:44.738 --> 16:45.939
JUST REALLY DONE UP.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.875
- THE FURNITURE FINISH,
IS THAT ON YOUR DIME

16:48.908 --> 16:50.210
OR IS THAT ME OR--

16:50.243 --> 16:52.278
- UH, DEPENDS ON
THE EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.913
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE A LISTING

16:53.947 --> 16:56.583
AND POUR MY TIME AND MONEY
INTO IT WITH A, YOU KNOW--

16:56.616 --> 16:59.085
YOU GIVE ME A MONTH OR TWO,
BUT IF I GET SIX MONTHS--

16:59.085 --> 17:01.755
- I'D BE WILLING TO GO
THE SIX-MONTH AGREEMENT.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.024
- EVEN THOUGH IT'S TYPICALLY
THE SELLER'S RESPONSIBILITY,

17:04.024 --> 17:07.193
I'M WILLING TO PAY FOR
THE STAGING MYSELF.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.461
THIS LISTING IS AN IMPORTANT
OPPORTUNITY

17:08.495 --> 17:10.764
FOR ME TO PROVE MYSELF
TO BOTH THE DEVELOPER

17:10.797 --> 17:12.098
AND THE FIRM.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.200
- DO YOU HAVE A SUGGESTION
DOLLAR-WISE, OR--

17:14.234 --> 17:17.037
- YOU GUYS HAD IT
ON THE MARKET FOR, WHAT, A YEAR

17:17.037 --> 17:19.739
AT $10.9 MILLION?
- YES, YES.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.808
- THAT'S A, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A LOT.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.476
TO BE HONEST, THERE'S
NOT MANY COMPS AROUND HERE

17:23.510 --> 17:24.811
FOR THIS TYPE OF TOWNHOUSE.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.279
ON THIS STREET, NOTHING HAS
REALLY SOLD FOR A WHILE.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.848
10.9 THROWS AWAY
A LOT OF PEOPLE

17:28.882 --> 17:30.817
WHO SEE THE 10
AND GET SCARED.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.686
BUT KEEPING IT 9.9,

17:32.719 --> 17:34.487
I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE'LL START
TO GET SOME...

17:34.521 --> 17:35.789
SOME TRACTION
IN THE MARKET.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.459
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.195
- THE COMMISSION IS REALLY BIG
ON A PROJECT LIKE THIS.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.329
BUT IT'S ALSO
A BIG GAMBLE FOR ME.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.330
I DON'T WANT TO BE SPENDING

17:44.364 --> 17:45.799
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.334
AND, YEAH, IT'S PERSONAL.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.435
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE SPENDING
THE COMPANY'S MONEY.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.370
I PAY FOR
ALL THIS STUFF MYSELF.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.072
I'M READY TO START MARKING
AS SOON AS YOU, UH,

17:52.072 --> 17:54.074
YOU SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE
OR SOLID LINE.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.542
- I'M READY TO SIGN, MIKE.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.914
[bell dings]

18:06.686 --> 18:08.355
- COME ON IN.
- THANK YOU.

18:08.388 --> 18:11.024
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
OLD HORSE STABLE.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.492
IT'S OVER 100 YEARS OLD.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.094
AND IT WAS CONVERTED
ABOUT 3 1/2 YEARS AGO.

18:14.127 --> 18:20.033
AND, AS YOU CAN SEE,
THEY MADE IT VERY MODERN.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.334
- HELLO.
- HI, I'M FREDRIK.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.569
- HELLO.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.037
- THANK YOU.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.271
LOVING THIS.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.239
[laughter]

18:26.272 --> 18:28.108
OHH!

18:28.141 --> 18:29.442
- YOU CAN LAY DOWN
IF YOU WANT TO.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.044
JUST DON'T GIVE BIRTH.
- CAN YOU OPEN IT UP?

18:31.044 --> 18:32.479
- DON'T GIVE BIRTH,
WHATEVER YOU DO.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.081
IN NEW YORK SOMETIMES,
I FEEL LIKE I'M SWIMMING

18:35.115 --> 18:36.516
AGAINST THE CURRENT.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.752
WHEREAS IN SWEDEN,
I CAN JUST, LIKE, RELAX

18:38.785 --> 18:40.520
AND GO WITH THE FLOW.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.056
IT'S A FRIENDLIER ATMOSPHERE,
FOR SURE.

18:43.056 --> 18:44.190
WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GONNA
FIND A HOUSE LIKE THIS

18:44.224 --> 18:45.859
IN THE MIDDLE OF STOCKHOLM.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.660
- I REALLY--

21:33.259 --> 21:35.128
TELL THEM WHAT
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.629
- KEN IS A VERY FAIR SELLER.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.865
BUT HE HAS DEMANDS.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.534
AND DON'T FORGET,
FOOD AND DRINKS BEFORE 4:15

21:41.568 --> 21:43.536
INTO THE BUILDING.
- OKAY.

21:43.570 --> 21:46.106
- WE'RE NOT GONNA LET PEOPLE
GO OUT ON THE ROOF.

21:46.106 --> 21:47.907
- MORE MONEY,
MORE PROBLEMS.

21:47.941 --> 21:50.510
- YOU TALKED ABOUT 40,
50 PEOPLE.

21:50.543 --> 21:53.913
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT HAVING
SO MANY PEOPLE IN HERE.

21:53.947 --> 21:55.015
- IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

21:55.115 --> 21:56.883
NO WORRIES, NO WORRIES.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.184
- WELL, I'M NERVOUS.

21:58.218 --> 22:00.787
BUT, UM...
I TRUST YOU.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.722
- I'M TELLING KEN THAT THERE'S
GONNA BE 40 TO 70.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.657
IN MY HEAD, I KNOW
THERE'S GONNA BE MORE.

22:04.691 --> 22:07.360
I KNOW THAT THERE'S
PROBABLY GONNA BE, YOU KNOW,

22:07.394 --> 22:09.062
150 OR SO.

22:09.062 --> 22:10.563
BUT WHEN I BRING
KEN AN OFFER,

22:10.597 --> 22:14.968
HE'S NOT EVEN GONNA CARE
THAT THERE WERE, LIKE, 1,000.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.936
ALL RIGHT, DO YOU HAVE
A BROOM OR SOMETHING?

22:16.970 --> 22:18.271
I THINK...
- YEAH, UM...

22:18.304 --> 22:19.305
- I DON'T SEE
A CLEANING CREW HERE.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.274
- UPSTAIRS.

22:29.082 --> 22:30.250

22:35.989 --> 22:37.223
SWEET.

22:37.257 --> 22:38.358
OH, IT'S WET.

22:38.391 --> 22:39.826
IT'S WET AND IT'S COLD.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.729
LET'S TAKE THOSE LANTERNS
AND PUT...

22:42.762 --> 22:44.597
LIKE, THE BIG ONES
IN THE CORNER, MAYBE.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.733
- OKAY.
- AND LET'S LET SECURITY GUY

22:46.766 --> 22:48.802
NOT TO OPEN THIS DOOR.

22:48.835 --> 22:49.936
SHOULD I TAKE THIS AWAY?

22:49.969 --> 22:51.404
- UH, NO, IT'S OKAY.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.740
I WOULD NEVER SAY
THAT A CLIENT IS DIFFICULT

22:53.773 --> 22:56.209
OR THAT A CLIENT, YOU KNOW,
IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

22:56.242 --> 22:58.878
- IF ANYONE GETS OUT OF HAND,
WE GOT A HATCHET.

22:58.912 --> 23:00.447
- YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.183
ESPECIALLY IN AN APARTMENT
FULL OF WEAPONS.

23:09.723 --> 23:12.625
[phone ringing]

23:12.659 --> 23:14.728
- FREDRICK SPEAKING.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.065
- HEY, NIKLAUS, I'M GOOD.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.600
I'M ON MY WAY TO A MEETING.

23:23.536 --> 23:26.072

FULL ASK?

23:29.275 --> 23:30.443
- OKAY, THAT'S A GOOD START.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:30.477 --> 23:31.644
I WANT MORE MONEY FOR IT.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.446
GET MORE OFFERS, YOU KNOW?

23:35.715 --> 23:37.250
THIS IS GREAT.
$1.3 MILLION.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.752
THAT'S A GREAT START.

23:38.785 --> 23:39.953
IT'S GONNA BE A BIDDING WAR,
I'M SURE.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.354
- THANK YOU.

23:41.388 --> 23:43.089

23:50.830 --> 23:52.766
[doorbell rings]

23:52.799 --> 23:54.467
- MICHAEL?
- YEAH.

23:54.501 --> 23:55.502
DONNA, COME ON IN.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.704

23:57.737 --> 23:59.339
THEY'RE A GREAT
FURNITURE COMPANY.

23:59.372 --> 24:02.208
WE'RE GONNA FINISH STAGING
33 CHARLTON STREET.

24:02.242 --> 24:04.277
WE'RE GONNA DO THE TWO GUESTS
BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.612
AND THEN THE HOUSE
IS GONNA BE PERFECT

24:05.645 --> 24:07.147
FOR THE OPEN HOUSE
THIS WEEKEND.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.382
- THESE ARE THE BEDROOMS,
SO I NEED TO HAVE THE REAL FEEL

24:09.416 --> 24:12.085
OF A FAMILY LIVING HERE,
SO PEOPLE CAN VISUALIZE IT.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.553
- DEFINITELY.
LET'S GET GOING.

24:16.356 --> 24:18.458
- COME ON, GUYS.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.296
- JUST MIND THE,
UH, MOLDING.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.498
THERE'S ALL THE WOODWORK.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.200
YEAH, I HAVE O.C.D.
ABOUT THINGS, YOU KNOW.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.935
THINGS ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.537
- THERE'S NO TOILET PAPER
HOLDER IN HERE.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.739
AND WITH ME,
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECT.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.841
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE, LIKE,
CURVY LIKE THAT?

24:34.874 --> 24:35.975
- NO, WE'RE GONNA FIX THAT.
- NO, WE'LL FIX...

24:36.076 --> 24:37.344
- AND, YEAH,
IT PISSES PEOPLE OFF,

24:37.377 --> 24:39.646
AND IT'S INCREDIBLY TIME
CONSUMING ON MY PART,

24:39.679 --> 24:41.948
BUT IT'S HOW YOU WANT
EVERYTHING TO LOOK.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.216
IT HAS TO LOOK PERFECT.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.250
- ARE THEY SYMMETRICAL?

24:44.284 --> 24:45.819
THAT ONE'S WOBBLY.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.854
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO SAY,
"I WANNA LIVE HERE."

24:49.756 --> 24:51.458
IS THAT A QUEEN?

24:51.491 --> 24:52.559
-<i>SI,</i>YEAH.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.660
-<i>SI?</i>

24:55.762 --> 24:58.531
I DON'T THINK THIS
IS A QUEEN.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.033
I THINK I'M PAYING
FOR A QUEEN

25:00.033 --> 25:01.868
AND GETTING A FULL.

25:06.139 --> 25:08.274
STAGING THIS HOUSE
WAS EXHAUSTING.

25:08.308 --> 25:10.143
IT WAS A LOT MORE WORK
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.177
LOOKS GREAT.

25:11.211 --> 25:12.545
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

25:12.579 --> 25:13.546
- I THINK KIDS ARE GONNA
PLAY HERE ON SUNDAY.

25:13.580 --> 25:14.547
- DEFINITELY.

25:14.581 --> 25:16.316
- IT COST ME ABOUT $30,000,

25:16.349 --> 25:17.917
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
TOTALLY WORTH IT.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.753
ALL THE PARENTS ARE GONNA BE
ABLE TO IMAGINE

25:19.786 --> 25:22.255
THEM AND THEIR KIDS
LIVING IN ALL THESE ROOMS.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.623
- WHAT A DIFFERENCE
FURNITURE MAKES.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.358
IT'S LIKE A MODEL HOME.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.963
- [laughing]

25:41.307 --> 25:42.709
- AND THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

25:42.742 --> 25:43.843
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

25:43.877 --> 25:45.745
- WELL, THANK YOU
FOR INVITING ME.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.615
AHH.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.216
THE OLD OBSERVATORY.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.818
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

25:56.256 --> 25:57.390
- WHEN IS YOUR FLIGHT LEAVING?

25:57.424 --> 25:59.526
- COUPLE OF HOURS.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.895
- WELL, IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THE STORY OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.396
YOU'RE AL--I MEAN,
I'M IN FAULT TOO.

26:03.430 --> 26:04.898
I'M ALWAYS ON MY WAY
SOMEWHERE.

26:04.931 --> 26:08.068
- YEAH, WE CATCH EACH OTHER
BETWEEN FLIGHTS, YEAH.

26:08.101 --> 26:09.736
- MAYBE WE SHOULD BOTH
TRY AND MAKE AN EFFORT

26:09.769 --> 26:12.272
TO HANG OUT, LIKE...
REALLY HANG OUT.

26:12.305 --> 26:13.606
GROWING UP IN SWEDEN,

26:13.640 --> 26:15.308
MY FATHER
WAS A WELL-KNOWN PERSON.

26:15.342 --> 26:16.676
VERY WELL RESPECTED.

26:16.710 --> 26:20.647
A BIG BANKER, SORT OF
THE ALAN GREENSPAN OF SWEDEN.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.048
NOW THAT I DON'T
LIVE IN SWEDEN,

26:22.048 --> 26:24.050
I DON'T GET TO SPEND MUCH TIME
WITH HIM ANYMORE.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.286
AND I WANT OT MAKE SURE
IT HAPPENS TODAY.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.091
- IF YOU REALLY ARE
AN ENTREPRENEUR,

26:31.124 --> 26:32.292
YOU WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING,

26:32.325 --> 26:34.828
YOU HAVE TO SACRIFICE
EVERYTHING.

26:36.563 --> 26:39.866
ARE YOU GETTING OLD ENOUGH
TO START TO RETHINK?

26:42.402 --> 26:43.970
I'VE BEEN WORRIED THAT YOU'D
BURN YOURSELF OUT,

26:44.070 --> 26:45.338
AS YOU KNOW.

26:45.372 --> 26:47.073
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE
A BIG STAR,

26:47.073 --> 26:48.241
EVEN THOUGH YOU MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY,

26:48.274 --> 26:50.710
EVEN IF YOU ARE THE BEST
BROKER IN THE WORLD...

26:50.744 --> 26:53.713
YOU HAVE TO RECHARGE YOUR
BATTERIES EVERY NOW AND THEN.

26:53.747 --> 26:56.483
NOW, I'M THE SORT OF
CARING FATHER THAT--

26:56.516 --> 26:58.385
- I NEVER SAW YOU
SAY THESE THINGS TO ME,

26:58.418 --> 26:59.753
BECAUSE YOU NEVER DID IT.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.087
- I KNOW, I KNOW, AND I--
- I MEAN--

27:01.121 --> 27:02.889
- I HAVE A LITTLE BIT
BAD CONSCIENCE ABOUT THAT.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.491
YEAH.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.731
IN RETROSPECT, I THINK
I WAS A DECENT FATHER,

27:11.765 --> 27:14.501
ALTHOUGH I DID
WORK TOO MUCH.

27:14.534 --> 27:16.703
- WELL, I THINK THAT WAS
PART OF THE PROBLEM.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.838
BECAUSE WHEN YOU WERE THERE,
YOU WERE SO AMAZING.

27:18.872 --> 27:20.373
YOU SHOWED US EVERYTHING.
YOU SHOWED US THE WORLD.

27:20.407 --> 27:22.409
YOU MADE IT FEEL LIKE
ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE.

27:22.442 --> 27:25.045
AND THEN YOU DISAPPEAR,
YOU KNOW, AND...

27:25.045 --> 27:27.380
- ISN'T THAT THE STORY
OF MANY FATHERS WHO WORK,

27:27.414 --> 27:30.917
YOU KNOW, REALLY, REALLY HARD
TO MAKE A CAREER?

27:30.950 --> 27:32.318
AND THEN THEY REALIZE

27:32.352 --> 27:34.554
WHEN THEY GET INTO THEIR 50s
OR 60s OR WHATEVER

27:34.587 --> 27:39.526
THAT MAYBE WE LOST SOMETHING
ON THE WAY.

27:39.559 --> 27:41.194
- YEAH.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.395
BUT YOU NEVER SAY TO ME
THAT YOU'RE PROUD.

27:42.429 --> 27:45.065
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU ARE,
BUT YOU NEVER SAY IT.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.801
- WE'RE SWEDISH--WE DON'T
SHOW OUR SENTIMENTS THAT OFTEN.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.536
- I TRY TO.
- YEAH.

27:49.569 --> 27:51.604
YOU'RE MORE AMERICAN
THAN I AM.

27:51.638 --> 27:54.674
- I WASN'T LOOKING FOR YOUR
VALIDATION OR--OR...

27:55.742 --> 27:56.876
ANY OF THAT.

27:56.910 --> 27:58.645
AND THEN HERE I AM...
ASKING FOR IT.

27:58.678 --> 27:59.713
SO...

28:04.551 --> 28:06.252
- YOU'RE MY SON.
I LOVE YOU.

28:06.286 --> 28:08.288
I DON'T CARE
WHATEVER YOU DO.

28:08.321 --> 28:10.056
WHATEVER YOUR PAST,
WHAT--NOTHING.

28:10.090 --> 28:12.058
I LOVE YOU.

28:12.092 --> 28:13.493
- OKAY.

28:13.526 --> 28:16.062
MY DAD WAS SO SUPPORTIVE
THROUGH EVERYTHING.

28:16.096 --> 28:18.665
MY PAST, THE PORN...
AND THE FACT THAT HE SAID,

28:18.698 --> 28:20.934
"YOU CAN BE IN LOVE WITH
WHOMEVER YOU WANT TO."

28:21.034 --> 28:24.037
MY DAD NEVER,
EVER ONCE JUDGED ME.

28:24.037 --> 28:26.206
- ARE YOU BECOMING
EMBARRASSED NOW?

28:26.239 --> 28:27.674
YOUR OLD MAN IS BEING...

28:27.707 --> 28:30.076
- NO, I JUST--
- SENTIMENTAL.

28:30.110 --> 28:32.712
- NO, WE CAN SIT HERE.
YOU CAN COME HOME WITH ME.

28:32.746 --> 28:34.881
I AM STAYING AT A HOTEL.
- CAN'T DO THAT.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.216
- LET'S GO TO THE MOVIES
TONIGHT.

28:36.249 --> 28:37.484
- CAN'T DO THAT.
- WELL, THERE YOU GO, SEE?

28:37.517 --> 28:38.885
- PLANE TO CATCH,
PLANE TO CATCH.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.053
- SAME AS--
- STORY OF OUR LIVES.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.521
- YEAH. YEAH.

28:50.263 --> 28:51.931
- THAT'S, I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
THAT'S A REALLY--

28:51.965 --> 28:54.100
I MEAN--
WE GOTTA TAKE THIS.

28:59.839 --> 29:02.575
- THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT
CONCEPT

29:02.609 --> 29:06.446
IS COMMUNICATING TO THE AUDIENCE
THAT THERE IS NO PLACE

29:06.479 --> 29:08.348
YOU WOULD RATHER BE
THAN UP HERE.

29:08.381 --> 29:10.016
- I ALWAYS WANTED TO ATTEND
A COMEDY CLASS.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.384
I MEAN, I THINK
I'M REALLY FUNNY.

29:11.418 --> 29:13.353
I'M HOPING TO LEARN HOW TO USE
MY COMEDY

29:13.386 --> 29:15.588
TO YOU KNOW,
MAKE MY CLIENTS HAVE FUN.

29:15.622 --> 29:19.025
- YEAH, I'M THINKING ABOUT
HAVING A BABY.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.061
- I'VE BEEN DRINKING A LOT
LATELY.

29:21.094 --> 29:23.630
I KNOW MY TRIGGERS.

29:23.663 --> 29:25.865
LIKE DAYLIGHT.

29:25.899 --> 29:28.368
- UM...

29:33.473 --> 29:34.874
I MEAN, I'M SWEATING.

29:34.908 --> 29:36.476
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO DO.

29:36.509 --> 29:38.244
SO I GREW UP IN LONG ISLAND.

29:38.278 --> 29:40.780
I DIDN'T EVEN TRY LIQUOR
TILL I GOT TO COLLEGE.

29:40.814 --> 29:42.182
SO I REALLY MISSED OUT
ON A LOT

29:42.215 --> 29:43.717
BESIDES THE EXTRA SIX INCHES

29:43.750 --> 29:45.719
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOVE MY HEAD

29:45.752 --> 29:48.388
AND THE SIX INCHES
THAT SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

29:48.421 --> 29:49.422
AND THE SIX MORE
THAT SHOULD BE THERE.

29:49.456 --> 29:51.257
[all chuckling]

30:12.245 --> 30:14.047
[phone ringing]

30:14.080 --> 30:16.850
- NIKLAUS SPEAKING.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.685
JUST FINE, HOW ARE YOU?

30:18.718 --> 30:20.520
SOUNDS GOOD.
LET ME HEAR.

30:20.553 --> 30:24.057
IT'S MR. 12-YEAR MAN.
HE'S BACK.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.760
HANG ON A SECOND.

30:26.793 --> 30:29.429
CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT?

30:32.232 --> 30:33.566
RIGHT, MY FRIEND.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.369
SORRY, THAT'S ALREADY
BEEN DOWN ACTUALLY.

30:36.403 --> 30:38.238
WE GOT ANOTHER PERSON
GIVING US THAT BID.

30:38.271 --> 30:41.307
YOU GOT TO GO HIGHER.

30:41.341 --> 30:46.179
- YOU WAITED 12 YEARS.
COME ON.

30:51.685 --> 30:56.022
- 1.32?

30:56.056 --> 30:57.190
THAT'S BETTER.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.692
OKAY, LET ME PUT THAT DOWN,

30:58.725 --> 31:00.760
AND I GIVE THE SELLER
A CALL.

31:00.794 --> 31:01.895
TAKE CARE, MAN.
BYE.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.063
CHEERS.

31:03.096 --> 31:04.698
- OVER 30% IN THREE YEARS.

31:04.731 --> 31:06.232
- IT'S GOOD.
- IT'S GOOD.

31:06.266 --> 31:07.534
IN THIS MARKET, I THINK
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

31:07.567 --> 31:10.670
- DEFINITELY IN THIS MARKET.
I'M SMILING.

31:22.082 --> 31:23.550
[knocking]

31:23.583 --> 31:24.951
- WHAT I'VE LEARNED RECENTLY

31:24.984 --> 31:27.220
IS THAT THE MORE WORK
AND EFFORT I PUT INTO A LISTING,

31:27.253 --> 31:28.488
THE MORE I GET OUT OF IT.

31:28.521 --> 31:30.090
- MICHAEL!
HI.

31:30.123 --> 31:31.424
- EVAN JOSEPH IS PROBABLY

31:31.458 --> 31:32.892
THE CITY'S BEST REAL ESTATE
PHOTOGRAPHER.

31:32.926 --> 31:35.395
HE DOES PHOTOGRAPHS FOR ALMOST
ANY OF THE HIGH-END BUILDINGS

31:35.428 --> 31:37.230
YOU SEE DONE TODAY.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.798
- ALL RIGHT, SO THE FIRST THING
WE'RE GONNA WANNA DO

31:38.832 --> 31:40.667
IS GET THESE PILLOWS
STRAIGHTENED UP A LITTLE BIT

31:40.700 --> 31:42.102
IN THERE PLEASE.

31:42.102 --> 31:43.370
- I ALREADY STRAIGHTENED
THEM UP.

31:43.403 --> 31:46.239
THEY'RE VERY STRAIGHT.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.108
- IT LOOKS LUMPY.
- LUMPY?

31:48.108 --> 31:50.343
- YEAH.

31:50.377 --> 31:52.445
- I THINK I DE-LUMPED IT.
- NICE WORK.

31:52.479 --> 31:55.248
- WE JUST NEED A FEW
MINOR ADJUSTMENTS

31:55.281 --> 31:56.649
TO THE FURNITURE PLEASE.

31:56.683 --> 32:00.086
UM, CAN WE MOVE THIS
MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.654
KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING.
KEEP GOING.

32:01.688 --> 32:02.822
THAT'S IT.

32:02.856 --> 32:04.057
- DON'T YOU HAVE
AN ASSISTANT FOR THIS?

32:04.090 --> 32:07.293
- STEP BACK A SECOND PLEASE.

32:07.327 --> 32:08.962
UH, KEEP GOING.
- YEAH.

32:09.062 --> 32:11.331
I MEAN, I'M OCD
WITH A LOT OF THINGS,

32:11.364 --> 32:12.432
BUT THIS GUY'S CRAZY.

32:12.465 --> 32:14.334
JUST TAKE THE PHOTO.

32:14.367 --> 32:17.604
- THIS STONE, THIS STONE, AND
THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR STEPS.

32:17.637 --> 32:19.572
SO IF WE MAKE THEM
UNIFORMLY WET,

32:19.606 --> 32:20.640
IT'LL LOOK A LOT BETTER.

32:20.674 --> 32:22.108
- JUST POINT AND CLICK.
COME ON.

32:22.142 --> 32:23.476
- IT'S STILL NOT REALLY
WET ENOUGH.

32:23.510 --> 32:24.778
- I DON'T GET IT.
YOU LOOK LIKE MR. CLEAN.

32:24.811 --> 32:26.079
WHY AM I MOPPING?

32:26.079 --> 32:27.147
- ALL RIGHT, WAIT, WAIT.
STOP, STOP.

32:27.180 --> 32:28.281
SMILE FOR ME.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.449
- NO, I DON'T WANT--
- NO, NO.

32:29.482 --> 32:30.550
NO, NO, I'VE GOT LIKE
A COLLECTION

32:30.583 --> 32:31.885
OF BROKERS WITH MOPS.

32:31.918 --> 32:34.220
- YOU EVER SEE ONE WITH A MOP
GOING AT HIS CAMERA?

32:34.254 --> 32:36.222
IT'S TAKING A LOT
TO GET THIS PLACE READY TO SHOW.

32:36.256 --> 32:39.225
BUT NOW, FINALLY,
I'M READY.

32:39.259 --> 32:42.262
ALL RIGHT, DONE.

32:48.301 --> 32:50.170
- HOW'S BUSINESS?
GOOD?

32:50.203 --> 32:52.172
ANY OFFERS?

32:52.205 --> 32:54.607
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

32:54.641 --> 32:55.775
COME ON IN.

32:55.809 --> 32:57.877
- SO I THINK
WE SHOULD CALL MARITA.

32:57.911 --> 32:58.978
- YEAH.

32:59.012 --> 33:00.580
- WE'VE GIVEN IT
A COUPLE OF DAYS,

33:00.613 --> 33:02.682
AND THE FINAL BID
IS 1.32 MILLION.

33:02.716 --> 33:06.152
SO I'M HAPPY TO CALL MARITA
AND GIVE HER THE GREAT NEWS.

33:06.186 --> 33:08.888
[line trilling]

33:12.492 --> 33:15.929
- HELLO, MARITA,
THIS IS NIKLAUS.

33:15.962 --> 33:18.264
GOT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

33:18.298 --> 33:20.533
WE GOT ANOTHER BID.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

33:20.567 --> 33:22.068
- OKAY.

33:22.102 --> 33:27.240
- IT'S 1.32.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.081
- IN SWEDEN,
JUST LIKE IN AMERICA,

33:35.081 --> 33:36.850
A SELLER ISN'T REQUIRED
BY LAW

33:36.883 --> 33:38.752
TO ACCEPT AN OFFER
AT ASKING PRICE.

33:38.785 --> 33:41.154
NOT EVEN OFFER
ABOVE ASKING PRICE.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.089
A LISTING PRICE
ISN'T A CONTRACT.

33:43.089 --> 33:45.859
A SELLER CAN ALWAYS BACK OUT
AT ANY TIME.

33:49.963 --> 33:53.299
OKAY.
YOU GOT IT, MARITA.

33:53.333 --> 33:54.834
- OKAY, BYE.

33:54.868 --> 33:57.871
- OKAY, SO IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
JUST-JUST--

33:57.904 --> 33:59.539
YOU NEED TO GET HIGHER.

33:59.572 --> 34:03.343
- RIGHT.

34:03.376 --> 34:04.678
- I'M GONNA SIT
RIGHT BEHIND YOU

34:04.711 --> 34:07.514
SO IF I NEED TO STRANGLE YOU
I CAN.

34:07.547 --> 34:10.517
- THAT'S TRUE.
[line trilling]

34:10.550 --> 34:12.152
- THIS IS PARE.

34:12.185 --> 34:14.054
- HELLO, PARE,
IT'S NIKLAUS AGAIN.

34:14.087 --> 34:16.856
- PARE, WE HAVE AMAZING NEWS.

34:16.890 --> 34:18.491
YOU CAN BUY THIS PLACE.

34:18.525 --> 34:19.826
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR 12 YEARS.

34:19.859 --> 34:21.661
IT'S GONNA BE YOURS.

34:21.695 --> 34:23.263
- THERE'S ONLY ONE
LITTLE CATCH.

34:23.296 --> 34:25.765
YOU CAN STILL GET IT FOR
A REALLY GOOD PRICE THOUGH.

34:25.799 --> 34:30.203
BUT THEY WON'T GO
AS LOW AS 1.32.

34:32.872 --> 34:37.110
EXACTLY.

34:39.813 --> 34:41.081
OKAY.

34:41.114 --> 34:42.649
- OKAY, 1.35.
GREAT, GREAT PRICE.

34:42.682 --> 34:45.618
GREAT, GREAT JOB.

34:45.652 --> 34:46.886
THIS IS YOUR LUCKY YEAR.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.755
- BYE.

34:48.788 --> 34:51.491
ALL RIGHT.
1.35.

34:51.524 --> 34:54.094
- WELL, YOU GOTTA CONVINCE HER.
- I WILL.

34:54.094 --> 34:56.496
- OKAY, CALL HER.
- ALL RIGHT.

34:56.529 --> 34:58.898
[line trilling]

35:02.168 --> 35:05.338
WE ACTUALLY GOT HIM TO HIGHER--
GOT HIM TO RAISE HIMSELF

35:05.372 --> 35:09.909
FROM 1.32 TO 1.350.

35:09.943 --> 35:11.511
WHOO-HOO!

35:11.544 --> 35:13.079
- THAT'S--I MEAN--
SERIOUSLY, THAT'S A REALLY--

35:13.113 --> 35:16.349
I MEAN, THAT'S 35% MORE THAN
WHAT YOU PAID THREE YEARS AGO.

35:16.383 --> 35:20.086
- IT'S A REALLY GOOD BID.

35:20.120 --> 35:23.790
- I'M SURPRISED BY YOUR--

35:23.823 --> 35:26.426
I'M SURPRISED BY YOUR REACTION.

35:26.459 --> 35:28.495
I MEAN, THIS IS REALLY,
REALLY HIGH.

35:28.528 --> 35:33.133
- THIS IS AMAZING.
YOU MUST TAKE THIS.

35:33.166 --> 35:35.368
- I MEAN, GIVE THE GUY A BREAK.
HE WAITED 12 YEARS.

35:35.402 --> 35:37.070
HE MIGHT NOT WAIT
12 MORE MINUTES.

35:37.103 --> 35:41.074
WE GOTTA TAKE THIS.

35:47.614 --> 35:48.815
- GREAT!

35:48.848 --> 35:50.650
- OKAY, THAT'S A VERY WISE
DECISION.

35:50.684 --> 35:52.218
THANK YOU.

35:52.252 --> 35:55.488
- ALL RIGHT.
[chuckling]

35:55.522 --> 35:57.090
HEE-HEE-HEE!

35:57.123 --> 36:00.293
- WHOO!

36:08.868 --> 36:10.470
- WITH 95 GREENE ST., I NEED
TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT

36:10.503 --> 36:11.838
AND I NEED TO DO
SOMETHING<i>BIG!</i>

36:11.871 --> 36:15.075
UNLIKE ANY OTHER PARTY
YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO

36:15.108 --> 36:17.043
SPECIFICALLY
FOR AN APARTMENT.

36:17.043 --> 36:19.646
SO THE FIRST THING I THINK OF
IS FASHION WEEK.

36:26.186 --> 36:27.220
- HOW ARE YOU?

36:27.253 --> 36:28.321
- WHAT GOING ON?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

36:28.355 --> 36:29.356
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

36:29.389 --> 36:30.824
- I PITCHED TO JONATHAN SIMKHAI

36:30.857 --> 36:32.759
WHO'S ONE OF THE HOTTEST
NEW DESIGNERS OUT THERE.

36:32.792 --> 36:34.761
LET'S DO YOUR AFTER PARTY...

36:34.794 --> 36:35.829
IN MY LISTING.

36:35.862 --> 36:37.364
HE FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE IDEA

36:37.397 --> 36:39.833
AND FROM THERE,
AN EVENT WAS BORN.

36:39.866 --> 36:41.568
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK
WE HAVE COMING?

36:44.471 --> 36:48.441
400?

36:48.475 --> 36:50.343
400 PEOPLE...

36:50.377 --> 36:52.712
ARE COMING IN
LESS THAN AN HOUR.

36:52.746 --> 36:55.548
KEN WOULDN'T TRY TO MURDER ME
IN FRONT OF 400 WITNESSES,

36:55.582 --> 36:56.816
WOULD HE?

36:56.850 --> 36:59.119
I'M MORE NERVOUS THAN YOU ARE
I THINK.

37:15.402 --> 37:18.038
- HEY.
- HEY.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.673
YEAH, HI.

37:21.174 --> 37:22.842
- MY MOM IS MY EVERYTHING.

37:22.876 --> 37:25.578
IT'S FUNNY, SHE'S LIKE
THIS ENERGY AROUND ME.

37:25.612 --> 37:28.782
SHE'S WITH ME, EVEN WHEN
I RUN AROUND IN NEW YORK.

37:28.815 --> 37:31.651
INTO CABS
AND I'M NEGOTIATING.

37:31.685 --> 37:33.553
YEAH, SHE'S MY ANGEL.

37:33.586 --> 37:36.122
LOOK HERE, THE COMPANY
IS IN THE PRESS AGAIN.

37:36.156 --> 37:37.257
- OKAY.

37:37.290 --> 37:38.458
- THEY SAY
ALL THE STUNNING LISTINGS

37:38.491 --> 37:40.593
AND THEY'RE SHOWING
ALL OUR PROPERTIES.

37:40.627 --> 37:43.163
- I'M VERY PROUD.
AND I WANT TO SEE.

37:43.196 --> 37:44.464
- OH, YOU WANT TO SEE
THE PROPERTIES?

37:44.497 --> 37:45.565
- YES.

37:45.598 --> 37:46.933
- NO, LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT MY WORK.

37:46.966 --> 37:49.836
I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

37:51.204 --> 37:53.840
- I, UH...

37:53.873 --> 37:56.242
I THINK FOR ME,
YOU WERE ALWAYS THERE

37:56.276 --> 37:58.378
YOU KNOW,
ON THE UPS AND THE DOWNS.

37:58.411 --> 38:01.514
YOU WERE ALWAYS A FAN OF ME.
- YEAH, ALWAYS.

38:01.548 --> 38:02.749
- ALWAYS THE SUPPORT.

38:02.782 --> 38:06.252
AND...I FEEL LIKE
WHENEVER YOU CALL,

38:06.286 --> 38:07.787
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

38:07.821 --> 38:12.125
AND WHEN YOU--
WE DON'T SEE EACH OTHER ENOUGH.

38:12.158 --> 38:15.028
AND I'M SO BAD AT GIVING BACK
SOMETHING TO YOU

38:15.028 --> 38:17.063
AND GIVING YOU THE LOVE
THAT I SHOULD BE GIVING YOU.

38:17.097 --> 38:18.698
SO...

38:18.732 --> 38:22.135
I GUESS MY OWN WAY
OF DOING IT IS I...

38:22.168 --> 38:28.174
I'M GIVING YOU THIS,
WHICH IS A GIFT FROM ME TO YOU.

38:28.208 --> 38:34.047
- THAT IS NOT TRUE.

38:34.047 --> 38:36.449

40:59.025 --> 41:00.760
EVERYONE WE INVITED
COULD BE A BUYER

APARTMENT A LITTLE BIT,

41:13.807 --> 41:16.443
BUT GET SEDUCED BY
THAT BLONDE GIRL OVER THERE.

BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

42:26.646 --> 42:28.715
I KNOW THAT WE NEED AS MANY
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE

42:28.748 --> 42:30.116
TO SHOW UP THIS PROPERTY...

42:30.150 --> 42:32.819
TO HELP SELL IT.

42:50.203 --> 42:51.971
WE'RE SHOWCASING THIS ROOM
FOR THE PARTY

42:52.005 --> 42:54.307
ONE, BECAUSE WE COULD FIT
SO MANY PEOPLE IN HERE,

42:54.341 --> 42:57.010
AND TWO,
BECAUSE THIS ROOM EXISTS.

42:57.110 --> 43:00.780
AND IF YOU'RE GONNA LIVE HERE,
THIS IS WHAT YOU COULD DO.

43:05.051 --> 43:06.853
NOW I'M WORRIED 'CAUSE...

43:06.886 --> 43:09.956
NOW IT'S LIKE THERE'S
OVER 200 PEOPLE HERE.

SO...
- THERE'S OVER 200 PEOPLE HERE?

43:11.624 --> 43:15.061
- YEAH, I COUNTED.
- YOU COUNTED INDIVIDUALLY?

43:15.061 --> 43:17.797
- YEAH.
I STOOD UP THERE AND I COUNTED.

43:17.831 --> 43:21.468
- LOOK, I KNOW THIS PARTY
IS HIGH ON KEN'S NERVES,

43:21.501 --> 43:24.104
BUT HE HAS TO TRUST ME
THAT IT'S IN HIS BEST INTEREST.

43:24.137 --> 43:26.806
- I THINK IT'S AT A POINT NOW
WHERE IT'S TOO MANY PEOPLE

43:26.840 --> 43:28.308
WHERE IT COULD GET OUT OF...
- OUT OF HAND.

43:28.341 --> 43:29.943
