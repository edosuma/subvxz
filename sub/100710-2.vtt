WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:04.787
- Previously on "The Flash"...

00:04.830 --> 00:06.136
- Photography
was always my passion.

00:06.180 --> 00:07.442
I figured,
why not make it my job?

00:07.485 --> 00:08.443
- These are great.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.184
- Frost, you have always

00:10.227 --> 00:11.272
been there for me.

00:11.315 --> 00:12.969
It never occurred to me

00:13.013 --> 00:15.537
that you might want
to live a life.

00:15.580 --> 00:16.799
- Nice doing business with you.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.628
- This is a potential cure.

00:19.671 --> 00:20.933
What's the bonding agent?

00:20.977 --> 00:22.457
- Dark matter.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.588
S.T.A.R. Labs
has the dark matter

00:23.632 --> 00:24.850
I need to take the next step.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.287
My cure will work.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.810
- Or turn them
into meta-humans

00:27.853 --> 00:29.333
against their will.

00:30.813 --> 00:32.467
- You cannot avoid
the coming crisis.

00:32.510 --> 00:33.642
- Just tell me what I can do.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.948
- The Flash must die.

00:41.911 --> 00:45.306
- I stared at that newspaper
for so many years.

00:45.349 --> 00:48.874
- "Flash Missing,
Vanishes in Crisis."

00:48.918 --> 00:50.615
- First it felt like a guide.

00:51.964 --> 00:54.532
You know, like proof
that things were

00:54.576 --> 00:56.578
headed in the right direction.

00:57.666 --> 01:02.062
Then it became a sword
hanging over my head.

01:04.499 --> 01:06.936
A part of me
always felt like...

01:06.979 --> 01:09.199
if I vanish

01:09.243 --> 01:11.810
in whatever crisis
is coming...

01:13.638 --> 01:15.423
Maybe I was still
out there somewhere,

01:15.466 --> 01:18.513
looking for a way
to come back to you.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.299
According to The Monitor,
that doesn't happen.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.566
- "To save the lives
of billions,

01:28.610 --> 01:30.002
the Flash must die."

01:30.046 --> 01:31.308
What kind crap is that?

01:31.352 --> 01:33.702
- No, I'm serious.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.486
I mean, The Monitor
shows up here out of nowhere

01:35.530 --> 01:37.662
and says that you're supposed
to die on December 10th?

01:37.706 --> 01:39.186
The last I remember,
that article said

01:39.229 --> 01:40.187
that you were
in a fight with Thawne,

01:40.230 --> 01:42.145
not some cosmic disaster.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.582
- The article changed.
- If that article can change,

01:44.626 --> 01:46.149
then that means that we can
still change the future.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.460
So what do we do first?

01:56.072 --> 01:57.465
- If a doctor told you
you were dying,

01:57.508 --> 01:58.901
you'd get a second opinion.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.905
So I'm gonna go see
this Crisis for myself.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.002
- You bring the cash?

02:13.045 --> 02:15.047
- I thought Gat would be here.

02:15.091 --> 02:16.266
- Gat's busy.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.969
Change of plans.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.362
It's $5,000 now.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.321
- Gat said it was $500.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.540
Okay, wait, please.
I will get you the rest.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.673
It's a matter
of life and death.

02:33.544 --> 02:35.329
Please, I will get
the rest of the money.

02:35.372 --> 02:36.678
I promise.
- Too late.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.080
- T-minus 30 seconds, people.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.604
- I knew this was a bad idea.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.214
- This was your idea.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.042
I'm just the guy
making dreams come true.

02:53.085 --> 02:54.652
- 20 seconds, people.

02:54.696 --> 02:57.046
- Okay, fine.

02:57.089 --> 02:59.004
Just do it.

03:02.747 --> 03:05.315
Did it work?
I sound like Caity.

03:05.359 --> 03:08.623
- You sound like a non-meta,
thanks to Ray Palmer.

03:08.666 --> 03:11.582
As long as this nanite
camouflage cocktail is active,

03:11.626 --> 03:13.845
your voice and eyes
will allow you to blend in

03:13.889 --> 03:16.021
with any group of regular Joes,

03:16.065 --> 03:18.023
so you can, you know,
live your life

03:18.067 --> 03:19.851
without scaring the ever-loving
crap out of people.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.244
- And what about my hair?

03:21.288 --> 03:23.028
- Trust me.
You'll fit right in.

03:26.945 --> 03:27.990
Welcome.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.994
Now, you two behave.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.996
I'm gonna go find
our star curator.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.737
- What am I looking at here?

03:35.780 --> 03:38.566
- Your next lesson, Frosty.

03:38.609 --> 03:42.396
Some of the very stuff
that makes life worth living:

03:42.439 --> 03:43.527
art.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.488
- Wowsers.

03:47.531 --> 03:51.840
Is this photographer
extraordinaire Kamilla Wang?

03:51.883 --> 03:53.233
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.017
- Thank you for coming.
- Mm.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.323
Yeah, of course.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.020
- Mm, very classy shirt,
by the way.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.457
- Oh, a very cute photographer
got it for me.

04:00.501 --> 04:01.589
She looks
a lot like you, actually.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.025
- I hope she doesn't mind

04:03.068 --> 04:04.331
that you already got
some schmutz on it.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.376
- I did not get schmutz--oh.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.986
Yeah.
Yeah, I definitely did.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.814
You know, sometimes you just
want your girlfriend

04:09.858 --> 04:11.773
to have a good turnout
for her show,

04:11.816 --> 04:13.340
so you make everybody clean up,

04:13.383 --> 04:15.429
and who ends up with
nanite juice on their shirt?

04:15.472 --> 04:17.257
- Wait, who'd you bring?

04:18.693 --> 04:21.391
You really do blend in here.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.350
- Except this place
is so lame.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.786
I mean, come on.

04:24.829 --> 04:27.179
This isn't art.
It's garbage.

04:27.223 --> 04:29.747
- Come on, Frost.
It's not all that bad.

04:29.791 --> 04:33.098
- There are used tissues
on this.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.449
Okay?
And this is just a plunger.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.887
Oh, my God, look at
the brushstrokes on this one.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.541
All right...

04:40.584 --> 04:43.718
Whatever guy made this
has some real issues.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.720
- Right, but, Frost,
that's kind of the whole point.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.417
Art reflects how we feel,

04:47.461 --> 04:49.245
so connecting to art
can help us

04:49.289 --> 04:51.116
plumb the depths
of our soul.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.381
Okay.

04:54.424 --> 04:57.775
What I am connecting to
in these photos

04:57.819 --> 05:01.126
is that the photographer is
afraid to get a shot in focus.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.433
- Those are actually mine.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.261
- They're not all winners.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.354
- Look, I can take a note,

05:11.398 --> 05:14.662
but if this is how Caitlin's
other half is gonna act,

05:14.705 --> 05:16.664
maybe she should skip
my next show.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.410
- Thank you for walking me
through this one, babe.

05:23.453 --> 05:26.326
- No problem.
The suspect is Allegra Garcia.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.718
She's 20 years old.

05:27.762 --> 05:30.330
She runs a carjacking outfit
out of Keystone.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.855
- Thanks to her meta-human
ability to control radio waves.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.596
That's a new one.
How is that possible?

05:35.639 --> 05:38.120
- Key fobs run
on radio transmissions.

05:38.163 --> 05:41.602
Anyway, Garcia has been
in and out of Iron Heights

05:41.645 --> 05:42.951
and juvie since she was 13.

05:42.994 --> 05:44.953
Last week, she tried
to hijack a car

05:44.996 --> 05:47.695
that belonged to some guy
named Salvador Traversoni.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.436
He lost control of the car,

05:49.479 --> 05:53.353
and, as you can see,
he died in the crash.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.006
- It says here
an eyewitness puts Garcia

05:55.050 --> 05:58.140
at the scene,
so open and shut.

05:58.183 --> 05:59.141
- Should be
with you working on it.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.142
- Mm!
- Mwah.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.230
- High five.

06:02.971 --> 06:06.975
Your Honor, due to a
preponderance of the evidence,

06:07.018 --> 06:09.107
the State intends to seek
the maximum penalty

06:09.151 --> 06:11.109
against the defendant,
Allegra Garcia.

06:11.153 --> 06:14.069
- Which is why the defense
would like to plead out.

06:14.112 --> 06:17.159
My client is aware that a jury
would put her away for life

06:17.202 --> 06:19.727
and is willing to settle for,
say, 15 years?

06:19.770 --> 06:20.989
- Is that true, Ms. Garcia?

06:23.426 --> 06:24.862
- I suppose.
- All right, then.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.386
I guess we can save
the taxpayers some time.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.782
Ms. Horton?

06:35.177 --> 06:36.831
- What the hell
are you staring at?

06:36.874 --> 06:37.962
- Nothing.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.443
Just, um...

06:41.444 --> 06:44.360
Your Honor, the prosecution
requests bail for Ms. Garcia.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.579
- What?

06:45.622 --> 06:47.537
- The defendant
is pleading guilty.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.974
- I know, Your Honor,
that it's a bit unorthodox,

06:50.018 --> 06:51.715
but...

06:51.759 --> 06:53.891
we've discovered new evidence.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.198
- My office doesn't have
the resources to find anything.

06:56.241 --> 06:58.069
- We just need a little bit
of time to determine

06:58.113 --> 07:00.289
if the State wants to pursue
a lighter sentence.

07:00.332 --> 07:02.422
In the meantime,
we request

07:02.465 --> 07:04.554
that meta-human dampeners
be placed on Ms. Garcia

07:04.598 --> 07:06.556
while we continue discovery.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.950
- Counselor Horton,
this court appreciates

07:08.993 --> 07:11.169
your commitment
to fair jurisprudence,

07:11.213 --> 07:14.738
but are you sure
you want to go down this road?

07:14.782 --> 07:17.088
- Yes, Your Honor.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.484
- Are you sure?

07:21.528 --> 07:22.833
- Yeah.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.052
- Where will you go?

07:24.095 --> 07:25.619
- December 11, 2019.

07:25.662 --> 07:28.186
It's the day after
I'm supposed to disappear.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.840
- Maybe we should loop in
the rest of Team Flash.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.581
- Not until we know the truth.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.105
- I just--I don't feel great
about you going in there alone.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.237
- I'm not gonna be alone.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.760
I have this.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.111
- Hello, Barry Allen.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.809
Preparing for temporal
observational protocol.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.550
- Is that Gideon?

07:43.593 --> 07:44.986
- It's a mobile
Gideon unit I built

07:45.029 --> 07:46.509
from salvaged parts
of the plinth.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.206
- You'll come right back
to this moment?

07:48.250 --> 07:49.338
Right to this second?

07:49.381 --> 07:51.166
- I promise.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.182
- Approaching Mach 1.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.532
Mach 2.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.579
Now approaching
November 30, 2019.

08:12.622 --> 08:16.539
December 1, 2019.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.801
Disruption barrier detected.

08:17.845 --> 08:18.976
- What the hell?

08:35.732 --> 08:36.864
- Your wound is still
not healing.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.430
- Mm-hmm.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.171
- My readings indicate
you were exposed

08:40.215 --> 08:41.433
to an extra-universal material
that destroys

08:41.477 --> 08:43.523
positive matter on contact,

08:43.566 --> 08:44.698
a substance
known as antimatter.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.438
- Antimatter?
That's new.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.266
- There's a wall of this stuff
clogging up the Speed Force.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.833
Gideon, how do I get past it?

08:49.877 --> 08:51.574
- Not without
additional assistance.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.271
Fortunately, there is
an expert in the field,

08:53.315 --> 08:54.925
Dr. Jay Garrick,

08:54.969 --> 08:57.232
formerly known as
the Flash of Earth-3.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.592
- Good to see you again,
Barry.

09:09.636 --> 09:10.593
- You too, Jay.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.203
- You were right.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.249
You were hit with a dose
of pure antimatter.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.859
Lucky you have speed healing,

09:15.903 --> 09:18.122
or that scratch could've
wiped you out of existence.

09:18.166 --> 09:21.082
- So is there a way that I can
time travel past the barrier?

09:21.125 --> 09:22.387
- You want to tell me
why the hell

09:22.431 --> 09:24.085
you were time traveling
to begin with?

09:24.128 --> 09:26.087
- I needed to see for myself
if The Monitor

09:26.130 --> 09:27.958
was telling the truth
about what happened to me,

09:28.002 --> 09:30.091
and I know what you're gonna
say about time traveling.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.222
- Actually,
I was gonna tell you

09:31.266 --> 09:33.573
you made the right call.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.402
For the past year...

09:37.446 --> 09:40.797
I've been detecting
antimatter signatures

09:40.841 --> 09:43.060
across the Multiverse.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.714
Now, we don't know
their origin,

09:44.758 --> 09:47.499
but if my algorithm is correct,

09:47.543 --> 09:49.589
all Earths could be in danger.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.113
- Then we have to find a way
to break through that wall.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.854
- Ah, your body never could.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.466
But maybe your mind can.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.731
I built this thing years ago,

10:01.775 --> 10:03.907
the neural hyper-collider.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.823
It harnesses neural electricity
and transfers it

10:06.867 --> 10:09.130
across superluminal particles.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.001
- Therefore projecting
human consciousness

10:11.045 --> 10:12.829
across space-time.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.483
You could send someone's mind
past the antimatter wall.

10:14.526 --> 10:15.658
- Not just anyone.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.312
It's gotta be a speedster...

10:17.355 --> 10:18.661
in his prime.

10:18.705 --> 10:19.662
You in?
- Yeah.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.098
- Then let's hustle.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.361
I've already had to postpone
my dinner plans.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.320
- Not any further, I hope.

10:32.327 --> 10:35.330
- Barry, I'd like you
to meet my wife,

10:35.373 --> 10:38.463
Dr. Joan Williams.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.378
- It is a pleasure to meet you,
Barry Allen.

10:40.422 --> 10:42.076
I've heard quite a bit
about you.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.691
- Allegra Garcia.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.040
Juvie offender
from a criminal family,

10:50.084 --> 10:52.564
in and out of the system
her entire life.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.871
The night of the particle
accelerator explosion,

10:54.915 --> 10:57.265
Allegra was caught up
in a fight.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.143
- Next thing you know,
she's got the power

11:06.187 --> 11:08.145
to control radio waves.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.716
Then she gets transferred
to the meta-human unit

11:13.760 --> 11:15.022
at Iron Heights.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.719
- At 15?
- Mm.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.982
Not exactly the justice
system's finest moment.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.680
Now here we are.

11:20.723 --> 11:24.596
Allegra gets arrested again,
but my powers are telling me

11:24.640 --> 11:26.163
that this time,
she's innocent.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.513
- But the victim was killed
by a radio wave attack,

11:28.557 --> 11:30.341
which is Allegra's
meta-ability.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.387
And an eyewitness
placed her at the scene.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.345
Even recognized her tattoo.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.695
- My powers have never
been wrong before,

11:35.738 --> 11:37.740
and I do not want
this kid going down

11:37.784 --> 11:39.350
for something she didn't do.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.439
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's not guilty.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.354
- Dude, come on.
Those are mine.

11:43.398 --> 11:44.747
- Sorry. My bad.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.359
See these burn marks
on the vic?

11:48.403 --> 11:50.753
They don't match
a typical car explosion at all.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.451
It's like he was burnt and
toasty before the car crash.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.715
We know that Allegra's
powers give her the ability

11:55.758 --> 11:59.022
to control radio waves
and not heat waves, so...

11:59.066 --> 12:00.763
- Allegra might not
have done this.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.112
- And I told Judge Hankerson

12:02.156 --> 12:04.027
there was new evidence
in Allegra's case.

12:04.071 --> 12:06.900
- Okay, guys.
All we have to do is find it.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.555
- CCPD already
interviewed this guy.

12:10.599 --> 12:13.080
You really think the eyewitness
is gonna recant his story?

12:13.123 --> 12:15.560
- Well, eyewitness testimony
isn't always perfect.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.649
Plus, environmental
factors, stress,

12:17.693 --> 12:19.913
even the order of lineup photos
can effect memory.

12:19.956 --> 12:23.568
So jogging his memory
while he is at home, relaxed

12:23.612 --> 12:24.656
might bring something up.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.267
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.748
- Unit 37.
Here it is.

12:28.791 --> 12:29.966
Uh-oh.

12:32.534 --> 12:35.102
I always come prepared.

12:38.453 --> 12:39.759
Oh, boy.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.586
- Allegra?

12:41.630 --> 12:42.892
- You're not going
anywhere, okay?

12:42.936 --> 12:44.111
We just want to talk
for a second.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.640
- Freeze! Freeze!

13:03.739 --> 13:05.523
- Allegra Garcia?

13:05.567 --> 13:09.005
You're under arrest
for parole violation.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.231
- I wouldn't touch that.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.147
- Sorry.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.675
- Jay told me
he's a doppelganger

13:26.718 --> 13:28.155
of your late father.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.678
- Mm.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.985
- Do I remind you of anyone
from your Earth?

13:34.901 --> 13:36.946
- Yeah, you do.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.469
- Hmm.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.210
Who is she?

13:41.516 --> 13:43.170
- Someone very special.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.345
- Ain't she?

13:46.347 --> 13:48.740
I never thought
I'd settle down.

13:48.784 --> 13:52.135
But I needed a neurological
specialist to help

13:52.179 --> 13:53.702
with my depleting speed,

13:53.745 --> 13:56.313
and something just
felt right between us.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.837
You ready?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.839
- Yeah.
- All right. Come on.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.015
- Let's do it.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.846
- Jay's helmet will help
channel the tachyons

14:06.889 --> 14:08.673
into your frontal cortex

14:08.717 --> 14:10.458
and ignite
your synaptic pathways.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.506
- I won't lie to you, kid.

14:15.550 --> 14:19.859
Beaming your mind past
an antimatter wall...is risky.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.556
- I know.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.732
But right now, it's a matter
of life and death.

14:23.775 --> 14:24.907
Let's do it.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.126
- All right.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.934
- His biometrics are crashing.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.241
- I'm also picking up
temporal energy readings.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.249
- His mind has broken past
the barrier.

15:02.292 --> 15:06.209
It's not just a new timeline
he's found.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.732
It's billions of them.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.213
And Barry's mind
is experiencing them all.

15:16.089 --> 15:19.614
- In order for billions
to survive this coming crisis,

15:19.657 --> 15:22.443
the Flash must die.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.060
- You have to get him
out of there.

15:39.634 --> 15:42.202
- "Oh, why should
the spirit of mortal be proud?

15:42.245 --> 15:44.595
"Like a fast-flittering meteor,

15:44.639 --> 15:47.337
"a fast-flying cloud...

15:47.381 --> 15:49.426
"a flash of the lightning...

15:49.470 --> 15:51.559
"a break of the wave...

15:51.602 --> 15:55.824
he passes from life
to his rest in the grave."

15:58.261 --> 16:00.655
- Barry.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.573
You're with us.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.011
William Knox.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.709
I've discovered that poetry
can stimulate

16:11.753 --> 16:13.929
collapsed neural pathways.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.497
- Lady Gaga
usually works for me.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.245
What's wrong with me?

16:25.288 --> 16:27.116
- The device overloaded
your neural synapses,

16:27.160 --> 16:28.988
creating a near shutdown.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.773
What you're experiencing now
is called neural entropy.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.470
- It feels like
my nerves are on fire.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.385
- They are.
Because you're a speedster,

16:35.429 --> 16:37.648
your synapses fire ten times
the normal rate,

16:37.692 --> 16:40.303
so you're feeling ten times
the amount of pain

16:40.347 --> 16:42.262
a non-speedster would.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.437
You'll feel better
in a day or two.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.873
- Okay, okay.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.267
- What'd you see in there, kid?

16:53.316 --> 16:54.709
- I saw...

16:56.798 --> 16:58.626
Billions of possible futures.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.022
Billions of deaths.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.113
All their pain,
their suffering.

17:09.158 --> 17:10.855
And then they were gone.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.164
I felt all of it.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.039
Now I know
The Monitor was right.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.651
I have to die.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.612
I need to go home.

17:28.656 --> 17:31.050
- Barry, Barry,
you can't be moving.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.226
- Please, I have to see Iris.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.883
- Ow, ow, ow.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.321
It's not getting any less ow.
- I don't understand.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.018
I thought Allegra
controlled radio waves.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.541
- So did we,
but she fired a heat blast

17:44.585 --> 17:45.847
right at Ralph.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.109
- It wasn't just heat.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.458
It was ultraviolet radiation.

17:48.502 --> 17:49.894
- He got a sunburn.

17:51.592 --> 17:54.073
- Yeah. From hell.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.900
- Look at his face.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.902
Most UV light gets absorbed
by the ozone layer.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.209
This was entirely undiluted.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.558
If it wasn't for his powers,

18:01.602 --> 18:03.212
that "sunburn"
would've killed him.

18:03.256 --> 18:04.518
- So put some aloe on it.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.346
- Okay.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.696
- Can I just talk to Caitlin
for a minute, please?

18:08.739 --> 18:11.177
- No.
I've got things to do.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.308
- What are we gonna do
about this?

18:12.352 --> 18:14.005
- Don't even get me started.

18:14.049 --> 18:16.704
Listen, even though UV rays
have shorter wavelengths

18:16.747 --> 18:18.488
than radio waves,
they're all part of the same

18:18.532 --> 18:19.924
electromagnetic spectrum.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.317
- So Allegra must be able
to control

18:21.361 --> 18:23.885
all the different
types of wavelengths,

18:23.928 --> 18:25.234
which means she could have
killed Salvador

18:25.278 --> 18:27.802
and our eyewitness.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.112
- And I set her free.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.418
Okay, help me understand

18:35.462 --> 18:38.117
why you pleaded guilty
this morning

18:38.160 --> 18:39.770
and now
you're suddenly innocent.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.729
- A girl can change her mind.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.688
- What were you doing
at the witness' apartment?

18:44.732 --> 18:46.255
- Just needed
to hash it out with him,

18:46.299 --> 18:48.953
prove it was wasn't me he saw.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.955
- That's something
a detective would do.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.957
- I'm trying
to be a reporter, okay?

18:53.001 --> 18:56.570
Figured this was as good a time
as any to get some experience.

18:56.613 --> 18:59.268
Get a story
and my freedom.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.183
But what's the use?

19:01.227 --> 19:03.403
You'll always see me
as a criminal anyway.

19:03.446 --> 19:06.057
- You know what I see?

19:06.101 --> 19:07.972
I see that scared little kid

19:08.016 --> 19:09.409
that I used to pick up

19:09.452 --> 19:11.237
for robbing liquor stores
when she was 13.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.195
That same girl that I would
check on in juvie

19:13.239 --> 19:15.284
who would always
tell me to leave.

19:15.328 --> 19:18.113
This morning, I get a ping

19:18.157 --> 19:19.941
that you'd escaped
from your meta-cuffs,

19:19.984 --> 19:22.596
and we find you in the location
of the dead State's witness.

19:22.639 --> 19:25.990
If you're a reporter,
how does this story play out?

19:26.034 --> 19:28.254
- I didn't kill him
or the driver.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.820
I was trying
to find out who did it.

19:29.864 --> 19:30.995
I swear.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.956
- DA Horton.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.653
- I took a chance on you,
Allegra.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.612
So you tell me right now.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.004
Who really did it?

19:40.048 --> 19:42.224
Tell me who killed
those people.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.834
- You wouldn't
believe me either.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.273
I want my lawyer.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.805
- This is insane.
This is insane.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.415
All of the evidence
says that she's guilty,

19:59.459 --> 20:01.504
but...

20:01.548 --> 20:04.333
my powers are telling me
that she's not just innocent.

20:04.377 --> 20:06.770
She knows
who the real killer is.

20:06.814 --> 20:09.469
I just need her to trust me.

20:09.512 --> 20:13.037
- All you need to do right now
is slow down.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.213
- No, what I need to do
is find evidence

20:14.256 --> 20:15.257
to exonerate her
before the trial,

20:15.301 --> 20:16.824
and I am running out of time.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.347
- Well, that's because
you're trying to do

20:18.391 --> 20:20.349
the public defender's work
and not your own.

20:20.393 --> 20:22.351
You do realize how much trouble
you can get in, right?

20:22.395 --> 20:26.050
You let Allegra out of jail
for an inexplicable reason,

20:26.094 --> 20:27.617
and now there's another murder.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.837
- But my powers
are telling me--

20:29.880 --> 20:31.230
- Two people are dead, Cecile.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.014
- You know this kid.

20:33.057 --> 20:37.148
You know her rap sheet.
It's petty crimes, robberies.

20:37.192 --> 20:40.239
It's not double homicide.
That doesn't even add up.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.632
- I haven't known this woman
in a long time,

20:42.676 --> 20:44.721
and the evidence adds up.

20:44.765 --> 20:47.724
We need to recognize
that unlike facts,

20:47.768 --> 20:50.074
feelings can be fallible.

20:50.118 --> 20:52.338
- Except when it's your gut.

20:52.381 --> 20:53.904
- I've never said that.
- You didn't have to.

20:53.948 --> 20:56.559
That is a scared kid

20:56.603 --> 20:58.561
with no one
to stand up for her.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.651
The Public Defender's Office
is overworked and underpaid.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.914
Joe...

21:03.958 --> 21:06.265
I'm the only one
who can prove her innocence.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.180
- Your job is to prosecute

21:09.224 --> 21:11.922
the cases that we bring to you

21:11.966 --> 21:14.577
using the evidence.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.710
I mean, it's like you...

21:16.753 --> 21:18.886
it's like you don't even
want to be the DA.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.279
- Are you telling me
I have to choose

21:20.322 --> 21:22.933
between using my powers
and doing my job?

21:22.977 --> 21:24.195
- That is not what I just said.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.284
- No.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.592
It's what you're feeling.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.515
- It was risky
to move him here,

21:39.559 --> 21:41.561
but he needed to see you...

21:41.604 --> 21:43.040
which we understand.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.912
- Yeah.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.305
- Thank you.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.745
- Your husband stared at me
that same way

21:51.788 --> 21:52.920
when we first met.

21:52.963 --> 21:55.139
- I'm sorry.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.794
You look just like
Barry's mother.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.318
- Oh.
- What?

22:01.015 --> 22:04.410
Well, Barry's physical pain
will go away,

22:04.453 --> 22:06.542
but the mental aspect...

22:06.586 --> 22:08.588
some of that won't,
not for a while.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.026
But I know you'll keep
an eye on him.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.507
- Thank you.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.648
So they are going to scan
our Earth

22:25.692 --> 22:27.737
for any other signs
of antimatter

22:27.781 --> 22:31.350
and figure out a way to prevent
whatever Crisis is coming.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.353
- It's not that simple.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.789
- Well, you said you saw
a wave of antimatter

22:35.832 --> 22:37.356
destroy Earth.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.270
All we have to do is come up
with a plan to stop it.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.185
- We can't stop what's coming.

22:41.229 --> 22:42.970
The Monitor
was telling the truth.

22:43.013 --> 22:45.755
- We get Kara and Oliver
and everybody.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.627
We create
an antimatter dampener.

22:47.670 --> 22:50.064
I don't care.
We just find a way.

22:50.804 --> 22:55.112
- I saw you and...
Caitlin.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.419
I saw everyone die.

22:57.463 --> 23:01.075
The only timeline where
you all survived was if I died.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.860
- No, no,
that's not the future.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.819
- I saw a billion futures,
Iris.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.211
- Okay, well, what about
the billion and first

23:07.255 --> 23:09.213
or billion and second?

23:09.257 --> 23:10.954
We control our destiny.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.869
We...

23:12.913 --> 23:14.871
can change the timeline
for the better.

23:14.915 --> 23:18.397
- Maybe this is the reason
I was given powers.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.224
To save everyone.

23:20.268 --> 23:24.141
- You said this morning
that you weren't giving up yet.

23:24.185 --> 23:26.535
- I have to accept this.

23:28.015 --> 23:29.538
We both do.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.758
- And do nothing while you
sit here and wait to die?

23:33.455 --> 23:34.935
This is isn't you.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.418
The Barry I know
would never stop running.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.899
He would find
another way to fight.

23:57.914 --> 24:00.047
It's open.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.399
Hey.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.531
- Hey.

24:05.574 --> 24:06.706
Iris wasn't answering
her phone.

24:06.749 --> 24:07.968
Is she here?

24:08.011 --> 24:10.144
- No, no, she's at work.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.406
She's working.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.453
- What are you doing home?
You okay?

24:14.496 --> 24:17.368
- I got hurt running
a Speed Force experiment,

24:17.412 --> 24:18.500
but I'll be fine.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.371
- Okay.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.286
- If you needed help
with something from Iris,

24:22.330 --> 24:23.636
maybe I could help you out.

24:23.679 --> 24:24.811
- It's this case.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.682
Allegra Garcia.

24:26.726 --> 24:31.948
Cecile has some very strong
feelings about it.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.036
- You want me to take a look?

24:33.080 --> 24:34.821
- Hmm.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.567
- How did you get hurt, Barr?

24:46.789 --> 24:48.704
- All right, look...

24:48.748 --> 24:51.011
you don't have to share
right now if you don't want to.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.709
Just know that I'm here.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.494
Always.

24:58.975 --> 25:01.369
- Something's coming, Joe.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.851
I have to make a sacrifice.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.767
But at the same time,
I can't help but feeling

25:07.810 --> 25:09.508
like it means I'm giving up.

25:10.683 --> 25:11.858
- Giving up?

25:11.901 --> 25:13.424
- Yeah.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.209
- When I was a beat cop,

25:15.252 --> 25:18.386
you know, I walked
the same patrol every day.

25:18.429 --> 25:22.477
One morning, I'm responding
to a noise complaint.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.305
Out of nowhere, pop.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.568
Bullet flies by my head.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.571
I got pinned down.
I called for backup, but...

25:29.615 --> 25:33.183
everything was telling me...

25:33.227 --> 25:34.663
that's it.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.232
Next morning...

25:38.275 --> 25:41.322
Barr, I can't even
tell you how...

25:41.365 --> 25:43.063
scared I was...

25:43.106 --> 25:44.804
to go back out
in them streets.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.240
- But you did.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.328
- Yeah.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.201
'Cause of this.

25:51.245 --> 25:54.857
Our badges,
your emblem,

25:54.901 --> 25:57.991
they're symbols of the strength
that we're charged with

25:58.034 --> 26:00.210
to get back out there.

26:00.254 --> 26:01.603
And we don't
make the choice to die.

26:01.647 --> 26:04.606
We would never
choose to do that.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.608
But when we hear
the call of duty...

26:08.828 --> 26:11.395
We're willing to make
that sacrifice.

26:11.439 --> 26:14.790
And that's not giving up, Barr.

26:14.834 --> 26:17.750
That's what you call
resilience.

26:17.793 --> 26:19.490
And I know you to have
plenty of that.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.022
- Hey, Frosty.

26:29.065 --> 26:30.066
Earth to Frosty!

26:31.807 --> 26:33.113
- ♪ What mainstream MC
can take ♪

26:33.156 --> 26:34.331
♪ Raw beats and bless them

26:34.375 --> 26:35.985
- Calling all White Walkers!

26:36.029 --> 26:37.247
You know what?
Frak it.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.902
- Hey!
I was listening to that.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.687
- Maybe you should be
listening to Chester's

26:41.730 --> 26:43.297
molecular monitoring system

26:43.340 --> 26:44.385
so he doesn't, you know,

26:44.428 --> 26:46.126
turn back into a black hole!

26:46.169 --> 26:48.128
- Relax, okay?

26:48.171 --> 26:50.913
I put the freaking alerts
on my phone.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.046
- Oh, you mean
these freaking alerts?

26:53.089 --> 26:54.787
Yeah, see,
I handled the situation

26:54.830 --> 26:56.745
and prevented us from
being sucked out of existence

26:56.789 --> 26:58.138
by a giant death vacuum.

26:58.181 --> 27:00.053
What did you do
with your Tuesday?

27:00.096 --> 27:01.663
- Nothing.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.056
- Is that--
- Nope, nope.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.187
No, no, no, no, no,
stop it, stop it.

27:04.231 --> 27:05.362
No, no, no.

27:15.198 --> 27:16.156
- Were you drawing?

27:16.199 --> 27:17.418
- No.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.333
- You were drawing.
- No.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.901
Because drawing
is for losers.

27:21.944 --> 27:24.338
- Mm!
Looks like you were drawing.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.079
- It's really hard, okay?

27:26.122 --> 27:28.951
- This is giving me, like,
minimalist reductionism.

27:28.995 --> 27:31.301
- I was trying to draw this.

27:31.345 --> 27:32.738
I've been
working on it forever.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.565
And it's not getting
any better.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.002
All right, that's...

27:38.569 --> 27:39.875
- Is this why you've been
all cranky pants

27:39.919 --> 27:42.225
since Kamilla's show?

27:43.749 --> 27:45.707
- You've just been trying
to express yourself.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.622
- I stink, okay?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.363
I don't know why
I thought I could

27:49.406 --> 27:50.364
plumb the depths of my soul.

27:50.407 --> 27:51.452
- Hey.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.675
You do not stink.

27:57.458 --> 28:00.853
You want to go off
and be Vincent van Snow?

28:00.896 --> 28:02.768
You want to show the world
what's inside of you

28:02.811 --> 28:06.510
using art or paint or dance,
do it.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.687
But you gotta
understand that...

28:08.730 --> 28:11.254
other people
are trying to do it too.

28:11.298 --> 28:15.694
- I feel like a Yakuza baddie
is stabbing me in the stomach.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.957
Repeatedly.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.742
Is this how I made everyone
feel at Kamilla's show?

28:20.786 --> 28:22.004
- Yep.

28:22.048 --> 28:25.138
That's a feeling
we like to call guilt.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.923
It's a little stabby.
But...

28:27.967 --> 28:30.752
it can also show us when we
need to make something right.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.724
- I told you,
I want my lawyer.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.031
- Steven's still on his way.

28:50.554 --> 28:53.427
Look, I understand
what you're going through.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.955
- Do you know what I see
when these cuffs are off?

29:01.348 --> 29:06.048
I see radio waves
and microwaves

29:06.092 --> 29:07.963
and gamma waves,

29:08.007 --> 29:10.749
and I can't stop seeing them.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.013
So how could you
possibly understand

29:14.056 --> 29:15.492
what I'm going through?

29:15.536 --> 29:17.581
- You have to let me help you.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.714
- So you can put me away?
- No, that's not why I'm here.

29:19.758 --> 29:20.802
- Then why are you?

29:20.846 --> 29:22.282
- Because I...

29:26.852 --> 29:28.375
Because I am a meta-human too.

29:28.418 --> 29:32.074
I can sense
other people's feelings,

29:32.118 --> 29:34.468
and, honey,
I can't turn it off either.

29:34.511 --> 29:37.210
That's how I know
that you're innocent.

29:37.253 --> 29:39.038
If there is anything
that can help me

29:39.081 --> 29:42.476
convince everybody else...

29:42.519 --> 29:44.870
please...

29:44.913 --> 29:46.349
you gotta tell me.

29:48.699 --> 29:51.485
- I told my arresting officer.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.400
He said I was crazy.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.316
I feel crazy.

30:01.887 --> 30:02.888
- Try me.

30:06.195 --> 30:08.154
- Back at juvie...

30:08.197 --> 30:10.852
the night that
particle accelerator exploded,

30:10.896 --> 30:13.507
I wasn't alone.

30:13.550 --> 30:14.987
My cousin was there
at the same time.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.466
Esperanza.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.555
Talk about bad influences.

30:18.599 --> 30:20.470
I wanted out of her gang,
so she jumped me.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.531
- She died in the explosion.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.533
Esperanza!

30:39.576 --> 30:42.014
Or at least I thought she did.

30:42.057 --> 30:44.843
- You think she's still alive?

30:44.886 --> 30:47.541
- Esperanza made me get
the same tattoo as her.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.717
- The witness ID'd you
off that tat.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.284
- But Esperanza's dead.

30:51.327 --> 30:52.676
There's no way it could be her.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.244
I mean, it's impossible.

30:55.288 --> 30:56.767
Right?

30:58.421 --> 31:00.336
- Hey, did you get
those juvie records?

31:00.380 --> 31:01.772
- Oh, yeah.
Took a bit of stretching,

31:01.816 --> 31:03.600
but we got about five years'
worth here.

31:03.644 --> 31:07.691
- Good. Is there a file on
a girl named Esperanza Garcia?

31:07.735 --> 31:09.824
- Yeah, there is.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.783
And I smell a mystery.

31:15.047 --> 31:17.876
- "Inmate was discovered
in a vegetative state.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.529
She has been taken
out of our custody."

31:19.573 --> 31:22.141
- Out of custody into the hands

31:22.184 --> 31:24.926
of a very redacted
organization.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.102
- Esperanza's alive.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.930
Cecile, did you hear that?

31:28.974 --> 31:30.801
Cecile, you got--get--there.

31:31.628 --> 31:32.673
- That's not me.

31:39.941 --> 31:42.944
- Bring me Allegra Garcia...

31:42.988 --> 31:44.903
or burn.

32:09.666 --> 32:10.624
- We gotta get you
out of here.

32:10.667 --> 32:11.886
Come on. Come on.

32:31.514 --> 32:33.821
- Get out of my precinct!

32:35.605 --> 32:37.520
Damn it.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.266
- Hey, what's up?

32:44.310 --> 32:45.964
- Barry, we were talking
to Cecile about her case.

32:46.007 --> 32:47.617
- Turns out that Allegra
had a cousin named

32:47.661 --> 32:49.271
Esperanza with the same
powers as her.

32:49.315 --> 32:51.143
Everybody thought
that Esperanza was dead.

32:51.186 --> 32:53.101
- Esperanza must've killed
the witness, not Allegra.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.451
Now Esperanza can't let
anyone know she's alive.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.018
- CCPD is in a total blackout.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.672
- She's going after Allegra.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.630
- I am going to send Ralph
there right now and--

33:00.674 --> 33:01.980
- No, no, no, there's no time.
I'm going.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.329
- Barry, no.
You're still recovering.

33:03.372 --> 33:04.852
- I'll be fine, all right?
I'm going.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.124
- Esperanza.

33:17.865 --> 33:19.127
- Hmm.

33:29.703 --> 33:32.967
I'm only Ultraviolet now.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.448
- No!
I won't let you do this.

33:35.491 --> 33:36.536
- Then you'll die too.

33:41.584 --> 33:42.759
- Keep them safe.

34:06.174 --> 34:08.481
- Get up, hero.

34:08.524 --> 34:11.179
I want you to die on your feet.

34:11.223 --> 34:12.398
- How did that happen?

34:12.441 --> 34:13.660
- Ultraviolet light travels

34:13.703 --> 34:15.879
at 186,000 miles per second,

34:15.923 --> 34:17.881
which is 80 times
your top speed.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.579
I suggest a hasty retreat.

34:21.537 --> 34:25.715
- Our badges,
your emblem...

34:25.759 --> 34:29.067
when we hear
the call of duty...

34:29.110 --> 34:30.807
we're willing to make
that sacrifice.

34:32.418 --> 34:35.551
And that's not
giving up, Barry.

34:35.595 --> 34:37.727
That's what we call
resilience.

34:37.771 --> 34:39.729
And I know you to have
plenty of that.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.085
- That's better.

35:10.586 --> 35:12.762
- Cecile, call the medic!

35:19.334 --> 35:20.553
- You know what they say.

35:20.596 --> 35:22.424
In a few days,
it'll be tan.

35:22.468 --> 35:24.557
- Yeah, well, I'm just glad
to be alive.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.385
- We were right.

35:26.428 --> 35:29.127
Esperanza Garcia was hired
to kill Salvador Traversoni.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.737
Then she offed the eyewitness.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.217
She tried to kill Allegra

35:32.260 --> 35:33.392
so nobody would know
she was still alive.

35:33.435 --> 35:35.220
- And you skipped over the part

35:35.263 --> 35:38.440
where this Ultraviolet person
might've been trained

35:38.484 --> 35:41.400
in the art of assassination
by a secret organization.

35:41.443 --> 35:44.142
- Yeah, that's on my
to-solve list.

35:44.185 --> 35:45.839
- Yeah, well,
it's on ours now.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.319
If there's a group out there
exploiting metas,

35:47.362 --> 35:49.321
then they're gonna need
our protection.

35:49.364 --> 35:50.409
Yo.

35:52.889 --> 35:54.369
What'd you put
in these painkillers?

35:54.413 --> 35:55.544
- Oh, you're not hallucinating.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.329
That is art.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.505
And some people
might think it's weird.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.507
But I think it is
a beautiful expression

36:01.550 --> 36:03.857
of the artist's inner life.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.641
Even if it's
a weird inner life.

36:05.685 --> 36:06.990
- But you bought
all this stuff?

36:07.034 --> 36:08.470
I mean, how'd you pay for it?

36:08.514 --> 36:10.168
- With Caity's credit cards.
All of them.

36:10.211 --> 36:12.213
Maybe our next life lesson

36:12.257 --> 36:13.997
will be in personal finance.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.477
- Actually...

36:15.521 --> 36:18.001
I've got one more piece
to add to the bunch.

36:18.045 --> 36:21.309
From a very daring
young talent.

36:23.964 --> 36:26.271
I think it ties the room
together quite nicely.

36:28.011 --> 36:29.839
- Well, there's no accounting
for taste.

36:31.319 --> 36:33.234
- You know,
my mom dated an artist once.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.844
He was a trapeze artist,
though.

36:34.888 --> 36:36.759
No-Net Nick, they called him.

36:43.288 --> 36:48.206
- Two books
and three bedtime songs...

36:48.249 --> 36:50.512
but little Jenna
is finally asleep.

36:50.556 --> 36:52.732
- She is persistent.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.255
- She gets that
from her mother.

36:54.299 --> 36:59.478
Look,
you stood up for Allegra...

36:59.521 --> 37:02.437
when nobody else did,
including myself.

37:02.481 --> 37:06.224
- Well, you are the badass
that charged

37:06.267 --> 37:07.877
a light-wielding hit woman

37:07.921 --> 37:10.184
in order to save
all of our butts.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.582
What's wrong?

37:21.587 --> 37:24.677
I just keep thinking.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.288
I'm not doing everything I can
to help the city

37:27.332 --> 37:30.248
as the district attorney.

37:30.291 --> 37:34.687
The justice system doesn't
always work for metas...

37:34.730 --> 37:36.297
which is why I want to become

37:36.341 --> 37:38.473
a defense attorney
for meta-humans.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.607
I know. I know.
You can tell me that I'm crazy,

37:41.650 --> 37:45.088
and we were not on the same
page about Allegra today--

37:45.132 --> 37:47.395
- No, no, no, that's not crazy.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.310
That is incredible.
- Really?

37:49.354 --> 37:50.355
- Babe, do you know
how many people

37:50.398 --> 37:52.226
you could help
in this city?

37:52.270 --> 37:53.271
- Yeah.

37:55.447 --> 37:57.362
And I know right
where I want to start.

38:01.061 --> 38:02.715
- Um, hi.

38:02.758 --> 38:04.630
I'm looking
for Iris West-Allen.

38:06.066 --> 38:07.633
I'm here about the internship.

38:07.676 --> 38:09.287
- Hi, yeah, Cecile Horton
told me to expect you.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.680
Welcome to "The Citizen."

38:11.724 --> 38:13.639
- Just don't touch
the vegan doughnuts.

38:14.509 --> 38:16.555
- You can put your things
right over there.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.828
- So what now?

38:28.871 --> 38:30.133
- We'll keep scanning
the Multiverse

38:30.177 --> 38:32.484
for antimatter
from my lab, okay?

38:32.527 --> 38:34.224
But I think, for now,
we should get going.

38:34.268 --> 38:35.922
- Yes, we should.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.578
Ah, the intrepid reporter.

38:39.621 --> 38:41.275
I thought you had a story
to put out.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.799
- Well, I couldn't let you
leave without saying good-bye.

38:43.843 --> 38:45.888
And I know it hasn't been under
the best of circumstances,

38:45.932 --> 38:48.021
but I hope we will
see you guys again.

38:48.064 --> 38:50.240
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

38:50.284 --> 38:51.416
- Till next time, Flash.

38:51.459 --> 38:52.547
- Yeah.

38:57.465 --> 39:01.034
- It was a pleasure
to meet you, Barry Allen.

39:03.079 --> 39:05.647
You keep being the hero
we know you are.

39:05.691 --> 39:06.735
- I will.

39:08.171 --> 39:09.390
- You ready?

39:09.434 --> 39:10.609
- Yes.

39:22.055 --> 39:24.405
- I know she's not
your mom, but...

39:24.449 --> 39:27.756
- Still nice to have a little
hope on a not-so-great day.

39:27.800 --> 39:28.844
- Yeah.

39:31.891 --> 39:33.327
- I'm sorry about earlier.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.677
- Don't be.

39:35.721 --> 39:39.464
You were in pain
and shock, and...

39:39.507 --> 39:41.074
I was scared too.

39:41.117 --> 39:43.859
But seeing you at CCPD,

39:43.903 --> 39:44.947
fighting with your all,

39:44.991 --> 39:47.733
it reminded me that...

39:47.776 --> 39:50.866
no matter what
this Crisis brings...

39:50.910 --> 39:53.565
no matter what you choose...

39:53.608 --> 39:55.610
I know that you're never
gonna give up.

39:58.091 --> 39:59.962
- I'm not choosing to die.

40:01.790 --> 40:04.271
I could never make the choice
to leave you.

40:05.838 --> 40:07.056
But...

40:07.100 --> 40:09.319
if my death is...

40:09.363 --> 40:11.191
the only way
to save the universe,

40:11.234 --> 40:12.627
to save you...

40:14.412 --> 40:16.544
I'm willing to do that.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.679
- Then...

40:20.722 --> 40:22.855
whatever we do next,
let's make it count.

40:25.161 --> 40:28.861
- We can start by preparing
the team for this Crisis.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.692
Maybe even a world
with the Flash.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.260
- So what do we tell them?

40:44.137 --> 40:47.140
- Beginning biopsy examination
on Patient 1-A,

40:47.183 --> 40:49.447
Mitch Romero,
male, 40s.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.668
It is my hope
that this procedure

40:53.712 --> 40:57.498
will help to illuminate
the effects of my cure...

40:57.542 --> 40:59.500
when exposed
to another subject.

41:01.241 --> 41:05.027
The body presents no obvious
signs of hemorrhaging.

41:05.071 --> 41:07.334
But it appears
the victim's blood...

41:10.468 --> 41:13.775
Has coagulated
with an unidentifiable

41:13.819 --> 41:15.690
biological substance.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.953
Will run analysis
on substance.

41:19.781 --> 41:21.174
Substance could
have been absorbed

41:21.217 --> 41:23.393
into victim's veins
prior death.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.913
- Greg, move your head.
