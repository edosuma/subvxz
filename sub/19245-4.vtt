- Where is everyone?

00:12.100 --> 00:14.571
What brings you to Vukobejina, Governor?

00:19.004 --> 00:19.804
The deer was eating it.

00:19.839 --> 00:22.089
Bears prey on reindeer.
Not the other way round.

00:22.124 --> 00:23.255
Torch is dead.

00:24.649 --> 00:25.801
Who's been living with you?

00:26.508 --> 00:28.576
The demon is among us.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.300
We're going to die. All of us!

00:31.373 --> 00:32.625
INGRID!!!

00:33.215 --> 00:34.478
Tavrani's tongue was cut out.

00:34.513 --> 00:39.944
He spoke to Tavra. I've heard
the voice before. I think.

Hindemith gave us drugs, Mia
Yeva, he used the Reindeers...

01:42.861 --> 01:44.524
used them to make the muscimol.

01:44.901 --> 01:49.725
The animal... is exhausted.

01:56.433 --> 01:59.426
There where other people there
sometimes, I don't know...

01:59.492 --> 02:00.687
an older woman.

02:01.125 --> 02:02.685
I don't know who she was!

02:05.061 --> 02:10.122
But worse than Hindemith, worse
than anything was the man...

02:10.187 --> 02:11.737
who had no face.

02:15.129 --> 02:18.532
When he was there,
everything was different.

02:18.602 --> 02:25.210
Girl, bring light.

02:26.495 --> 02:32.601
He was the cold from
outside, maybe he was death!

02:38.015 --> 02:39.470
Don't hurt her.

02:47.078 --> 02:47.994
Don't...

02:49.655 --> 02:51.454
Bring me the fresh one.

02:51.502 --> 02:55.294
He brought darkness with him.

02:55.392 --> 02:59.660
That who came in here,
the man who had no face.

02:59.745 --> 03:02.800
And he got to Tavrani and he
made him scream until he couldn't

03:02.865 --> 03:04.354
scream anymore.

03:11.064 --> 03:14.454
You never saw him anywhere
else... without the snow goggles?

03:14.455 --> 03:16.341
I never saw his face.

03:17.676 --> 03:20.135
Hindemith was nuts.

03:20.645 --> 03:24.330
But that guy... he
scared the fuck out of me.

03:30.295 --> 03:34.046
Hey. It's going to be okay.

03:35.255 --> 03:38.407
Eric, Munk's coming in.
He wants a progress report.

03:39.829 --> 03:42.142
Still, that won't take long.

03:44.573 --> 03:48.935
- Tavra will talk.
- Someone cut out his tongue, Eric.

03:49.135 --> 03:51.066
He can write, can't he?

03:53.535 --> 03:55.814
He won't protect someone who
cut his fucking tongue out!

03:55.869 --> 03:57.095
You're the Sheriff.

04:02.836 --> 04:04.534
Hong.

04:04.591 --> 04:06.472
My daughter, Bianca.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.518
She didn't come home.

04:43.175 --> 04:44.449
Thank you.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.666
Still nothing in either eye?

05:18.224 --> 05:19.100
Not a fucking thing.

05:19.135 --> 05:23.374
And there was no kind of warning?
No fogging, no blurred vision?

05:23.375 --> 05:28.234
Erm, just, just, just that headache.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.837
Well, it doesn't sound like
a tumour. That's good news.

05:33.468 --> 05:34.698
Is that the end of the good news?

05:34.733 --> 05:36.466
It's pretty fucking good, Vince.

05:38.935 --> 05:40.986
We need to get you back, now.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.764
I'll call, get the chopper out.

05:47.215 --> 05:51.175
This happened to a friend of
mine at UCL, week before Finals.

05:51.210 --> 05:54.060
She went totally blind in one
eye, sitting on the toilet.

05:54.107 --> 05:58.216
Two days later, fully
recovered. She got First.

06:00.975 --> 06:02.169
What was her name?

06:02.204 --> 06:03.734
What do you mean, what was her name?

06:03.735 --> 06:07.256
This "friend" or yours,
erm. What was she called?

06:07.295 --> 06:08.495
What was her name?

06:08.732 --> 06:09.958
Julie.

06:12.679 --> 06:13.974
You never mentioned her before.

06:13.975 --> 06:15.900
It's not the sort of thing you'd
chuck into a conversation, is it?

06:15.935 --> 06:18.066
I'll have a dry white and by the
way, I once had a friend who went

06:18.139 --> 06:20.242
blind on a fucking toilet!

06:26.935 --> 06:30.284
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Natalie!

06:36.735 --> 06:38.690
You're not going to like this.

06:38.725 --> 06:40.800
Tavra had a heart attack this morning.

06:40.870 --> 06:44.865
The stress of the mutilation, plus
there's a history of arrhythmia.

06:45.801 --> 06:49.522
He's alive, but we can't
talk to him. Not now.

06:52.103 --> 06:55.440
Rune's girl was in the muscimol
den. We should find her.

07:02.175 --> 07:03.441
Yeva.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.728
I need to speak to Munk.

07:23.575 --> 07:24.658
Hey.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.099
How was Vuko?

07:27.797 --> 07:28.957
Cool.

07:30.907 --> 07:38.472
In fact... I was thinking,
now that we've sold the boat...

07:39.440 --> 07:41.279
we can afford to move there.

07:42.558 --> 07:43.910
You sold it?

07:44.943 --> 07:50.094
Yeah. Agreed the terms, shook hands.

07:56.335 --> 07:58.109
- I'm sorry.
- Ah.

08:02.695 --> 08:08.220
So now, what I want, is to find a doctor.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.281
The best damn specialist there is.

08:10.342 --> 08:11.626
Michael...

08:13.855 --> 08:14.790
We talked about this.

08:14.825 --> 08:16.955
No. You talked about this.

08:19.252 --> 08:26.538
Freya... medicine, it comes on all
the time. Trials, breakthroughs,

08:26.585 --> 08:27.894
new kinds of treatment.

08:27.956 --> 08:31.374
Michael, we can't fix this.

08:31.436 --> 08:37.260
Now we need you to fight
this thing. I need you!

08:38.807 --> 08:42.332
We always taught the
children to pick their fights.

08:43.647 --> 08:45.314
You taught them that.

08:54.499 --> 08:58.180
Dr. Khatri, what can I do for you?

08:58.248 --> 09:00.585
I need Dan Andersson's medical records.

09:01.316 --> 09:03.578
You must know, they are confidential.

09:03.613 --> 09:05.879
In all matters of public health
in Fortitude, I have the full

09:05.944 --> 09:08.279
authority of the W.H.O,
the Norwegian government and

09:08.338 --> 09:09.858
of course the governor.

09:10.567 --> 09:15.231
I wasn't aware of that. May
I ask what your concern is?

09:15.735 --> 09:18.681
Aren't you the least bit
surprised by his recovery?

09:19.462 --> 09:21.226
I believe in miracles.

09:21.261 --> 09:25.095
I don't. Especially
the recent test results.

10:02.021 --> 10:09.087
Good morning, Eric. Everything
okay with you and Hildur?

10:10.655 --> 10:14.018
What? Of course. Why?

10:14.992 --> 10:21.138
No reason. So, what do we have?

10:21.895 --> 10:23.525
It's Bianca Mankyo.

10:23.878 --> 10:25.151
The killer?

10:25.261 --> 10:28.668
No. The headless girl. We identified her.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.569
Was she a prostitute?

10:31.604 --> 10:32.612
What?

10:33.634 --> 10:39.100
So often young girls found dead have
been involved in that sort of thing.

10:39.135 --> 10:40.538
She wasn't a prostitute.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.765
She was a sweet, kind, girl who
worked at the supermarket and

10:43.830 --> 10:45.752
someone cut her fucking head off.

10:47.575 --> 10:48.964
The taxidermist?

10:49.572 --> 10:50.973
We can't be sure of that.

10:51.642 --> 10:54.688
But the taxidermist killed the geologist.

10:54.860 --> 10:55.927
We're not ruling that out.

10:55.975 --> 10:59.497
- But not the shop girl?
- It's too early to say for definite.

11:02.535 --> 11:05.902
What can we say... for definite?

11:07.535 --> 11:09.721
- It's all about muscimol.
- Muscimol?

11:09.756 --> 11:13.171
A local narcotic drink made
by feeding poisonous mushrooms

11:13.239 --> 11:15.562
to reindeer and then collecting the urine.

11:15.597 --> 11:17.055
Which is then drunk.

11:18.034 --> 11:19.271
Are you making fun of me?

11:19.330 --> 11:22.929
No. The liver separates the
narcotic from the toxins.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.631
It connects all the victims:
Tavrani Tavra made it, Hindemith

11:26.666 --> 11:29.420
drank it and Bianca was
killed where they took it.

11:29.463 --> 11:35.229
So we're dealing with a turf
war in this er... this drug?

11:35.277 --> 11:36.042
No.

11:36.077 --> 11:38.537
We're dealing with a fucking psychopath.

13:33.136 --> 13:34.371
Vladek?

13:34.450 --> 13:37.853
You shouldn't climb the
ladder, Freya. You might fall.

13:41.415 --> 13:42.803
How did you know?

13:43.877 --> 13:45.136
Always.

13:50.877 --> 13:52.797
I'll bring you something to eat.

14:18.603 --> 14:19.620
Hildur.

14:20.587 --> 14:22.393
Do you have a moment?

14:25.585 --> 14:31.824
I'm sorry, Hildur. There's nothing
I can do, Oslo made its decision.

14:31.864 --> 14:33.537
I have something to tell you. Which...

14:33.572 --> 14:35.927
I under, I understand how upset you are.

14:36.014 --> 14:40.750
And believe me, this is not my dream job.

14:40.785 --> 14:43.344
I, err... just came back from Vukobejina.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.155
There's, err... some kind of crisis there.

14:46.190 --> 14:49.655
The port is closed, I saw
soldiers on the streets...

14:49.690 --> 14:51.655
secret service people.

14:52.341 --> 14:53.710
Why are you telling me this?

14:53.745 --> 14:57.858
I believe they are suffering
a disaster, like we did.

14:58.485 --> 15:03.224
Erling, our government needs to
know about this. We need to make

15:03.275 --> 15:06.929
contact with the Russians, we need
to cooperate and share information.

15:06.991 --> 15:08.886
Let me share something with you.

15:09.987 --> 15:13.586
Have you any idea how lucky you are?

15:13.785 --> 15:22.519
You have been paid actual money...
to stop governing this freezing

15:22.554 --> 15:29.108
sewer with its flesh eating wasps
and headless fucking corpses.

15:31.345 --> 15:35.254
But still you come here, into
this shitty little office, trying

15:35.289 --> 15:37.059
to make yourself look important!

15:37.121 --> 15:43.237
Have you any idea how sad
and ridiculous you look?

15:53.682 --> 16:02.776
This freezing sewer was my life,
and nobody has the basic human

16:02.811 --> 16:07.214
decency to say sorry, or even fucking why!

16:08.465 --> 16:11.441
And you don't deserve
this shitty little office.

16:24.895 --> 16:32.656
Eric. Dan tells me there
was another killing.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.029
Where were you last night?

16:35.504 --> 16:38.644
Err, I had to stay over in Vukobejina.

16:38.905 --> 16:40.189
Were you alone?

16:43.569 --> 16:44.984
Eric, please.

16:45.056 --> 16:46.611
I asked you a question.

16:48.682 --> 16:51.089
I'm staying at the hotel for a while.

16:51.982 --> 16:53.141
Who were you with?

16:53.392 --> 16:55.064
I can't go on like this.

16:55.065 --> 16:56.594
WERE YOU ALONE?

17:05.191 --> 17:06.218
_

17:55.705 --> 17:59.984
Dan. Hong...

17:59.985 --> 18:01.460
Eric.

18:01.541 --> 18:03.419
I bought you some rock salt.

18:04.465 --> 18:06.264
I'm cooking a meal.

18:06.265 --> 18:07.856
You don't have to do that.

18:07.898 --> 18:09.393
Oh, it's not for you.

18:12.305 --> 18:14.105
I'll bring back a doggy bag.

18:19.385 --> 18:20.625
Thank you.

18:28.744 --> 18:30.308
May I see her room?

19:55.385 --> 19:56.378
Bad morning?

20:00.305 --> 20:01.270
You?

20:03.585 --> 20:04.801
Wanna talk about it?

20:05.246 --> 20:10.778
Not really. You?

20:13.974 --> 20:17.726
Michael, I have to do something,
err, difficult and illegal.

20:17.776 --> 20:18.968
I need your help.

20:30.991 --> 20:32.067
You okay?

20:32.137 --> 20:38.287
Sure. My friend's been murdered,
there's nothing I can do.

20:39.002 --> 20:41.948
Apart from that, it's all chilled.

20:42.027 --> 20:43.427
You tell Eric everything, right?

20:43.486 --> 20:46.344
About Bianca, the muscimol, the
people you saw in that place?

20:46.345 --> 20:47.902
Is he really the Sheriff now?

20:47.937 --> 20:52.232
- Don't get me started.
- Get in.

21:01.579 --> 21:03.378
It stinks of booze in here.

21:03.652 --> 21:07.740
Ingrid, Petra, get to the
cemetery. I've reports of a fire.

21:08.946 --> 21:12.568
Supposing you can break into
Munk's room, his computer, it must

21:12.631 --> 21:13.777
have a password.

21:13.812 --> 21:17.364
Of course. I called his old
secretary in Oslo to get it.

21:17.438 --> 21:19.904
Oh, and she just blurted it out, right?

21:19.905 --> 21:23.883
No, but err, she's been having
an affair with him for years and

21:23.948 --> 21:26.133
it would be bad for her
if her husband found out.

21:26.168 --> 21:29.664
I see. Woah.

21:29.699 --> 21:33.471
You really are, you're just so
pissed off at everybody, aren't you?

21:33.541 --> 21:37.560
I gave my life to that job,
I want to know why I lost it!

21:37.883 --> 21:40.671
Munk will have discussed it
on email with his superiors.

21:40.706 --> 21:45.189
If they have acted improperly, I
can force them to re-instate me.

21:45.533 --> 21:47.643
Just move on. Get another job.

21:47.868 --> 21:49.839
You know, what normal people do.

21:49.874 --> 21:53.195
I have another job. I
got an email this morning.

21:53.268 --> 21:55.685
An old friend in Oslo, he has a PR firm.

21:55.720 --> 21:59.150
It's a lot more money, plus
car and pension package.

21:59.217 --> 22:04.521
Well, Hildy, that's... great.

22:04.556 --> 22:05.513
Yes, it is.

22:05.548 --> 22:08.049
- You'd be nuts to turn that down.
- Yes, I would.

22:08.096 --> 22:09.464
Congratulations.

22:09.527 --> 22:11.207
Thank you. Yes or no?

22:34.705 --> 22:39.321
Vladek. What are you doing here?

22:41.465 --> 22:42.946
You brought me here.

22:43.203 --> 22:45.947
Brought you? What are you talking about?

22:46.005 --> 22:49.448
Just now. In your dream. You called me.

22:49.513 --> 22:53.428
You summoned me up from
the world of the dead.

22:56.065 --> 22:57.284
What?

22:59.591 --> 23:05.270
No, you... You left the house
with a big stripy towel and a

23:05.345 --> 23:06.529
swimming costume.

23:13.625 --> 23:17.065
So, you currently reside
in the world of the dead?

23:19.365 --> 23:20.467
You know...

23:21.305 --> 23:23.665
it's a place I'm very familiar with.

23:24.951 --> 23:27.942
It's as real as this place.

23:32.905 --> 23:34.523
Are you crazy?

23:35.537 --> 23:43.520
Maybe. I don't know, I
suppose. Like all of us.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.146
All of us what?

23:50.025 --> 23:53.333
I'm a shaman.

23:54.545 --> 23:56.145
A shaman?

23:57.905 --> 24:00.104
Like a witch doctor?

24:00.143 --> 24:04.782
No. Not like a witch doctor.

24:05.145 --> 24:13.544
Okay. Erm... A spirit healer.
Communes with the spirits.

24:13.545 --> 24:18.192
Walks among the dead. Heals the sick.

24:23.185 --> 24:24.706
Sometimes.

24:30.505 --> 24:32.305
Why don't you prove it to me?

24:59.497 --> 25:01.774
Are you guys ever going
to catch this psychopath?

25:01.865 --> 25:03.054
Shut up.

25:25.769 --> 25:28.344
Someone made a big fire?

25:28.345 --> 25:32.440
Yeah... To soften the earth...

25:35.545 --> 25:38.390
Yeah. It's an old grave of a child.

25:43.785 --> 25:44.835
Oh.

25:46.951 --> 25:55.229
Tavra... I totally know
what all this is. All of it.

25:57.225 --> 25:58.439
I think.

26:08.414 --> 26:09.317
Yes.

26:10.798 --> 26:12.032
You shouldn't call me here.

26:16.025 --> 26:19.479
It's still early, but the results
of last night's hepatectomy are

26:19.514 --> 26:21.033
incredibly encouraging.

26:21.202 --> 26:23.804
There's clear evidence of
complex tissue regeneration.

26:26.105 --> 26:29.991
Indeed. Maybe what doesn't kill
you really can make you stronger.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.573
Dan Anderssen.

26:34.325 --> 26:37.519
I strongly recommend a contingency
plan to be put in place.

26:57.425 --> 27:01.496
A grave has been desecrated.
A little girls remains have

27:01.540 --> 27:02.900
been stolen.

27:03.351 --> 27:11.990
Her name is Suluk Tavra. I know
she is an ancestor of yours...

27:12.070 --> 27:14.504
And I know what he is
going to do to her soul.

27:14.606 --> 27:15.535
So do you...

27:15.777 --> 27:17.717
We can stop it before it is too late.

27:24.465 --> 27:28.875
If you decide to help
her... You know where I am.

28:05.144 --> 28:06.681
You're early.

28:17.185 --> 28:17.907
Hi.

28:17.973 --> 28:20.874
Cybercrime division, Oslo.

28:22.425 --> 28:25.032
Two stoners and a dog.

28:25.136 --> 28:28.194
- Are you there?
- Yes, I'm here, thank you.

28:30.384 --> 28:31.627
You find the girl?

28:32.181 --> 28:34.018
No, but Petra has a theory.

28:34.082 --> 28:35.121
Me too.

28:35.278 --> 28:36.918
She went to the hospital.

28:37.025 --> 28:40.364
Rune told me that Bianca's
hobby was hacking into official

28:40.418 --> 28:44.012
government systems and leaving
short messages of peace and hope.

28:44.065 --> 28:47.084
But he also said she passed
on information she found, she

28:47.157 --> 28:51.719
recently gave your father some crab
data she got illegally from FARC.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.464
And now her laptop is missing!

28:54.465 --> 28:56.744
So my father had her rubbed out?

28:57.308 --> 28:59.139
I didn't say that.

29:00.071 --> 29:03.497
He was in Vukobejina with your
wife the night she was killed.

29:03.730 --> 29:05.345
Can we rule him out now?

29:30.111 --> 29:31.332
You seem tense.

29:33.265 --> 29:34.456
Not at all.

29:51.896 --> 29:54.037
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

29:56.479 --> 29:58.021
I'm an only child.

29:58.056 --> 30:00.786
I attended the local comprehensive
school and won a scholarship

30:00.821 --> 30:02.380
to read medicine at Cambridge.

30:02.415 --> 30:06.265
I did my postgraduate degree at
Oxford, then a doctoral thesis

30:06.323 --> 30:07.256
at M.I.T.

30:07.302 --> 30:10.254
Vector genetic variations
in host-parasite antagonistic

30:10.304 --> 30:11.641
coevolution.

30:14.745 --> 30:18.334
Your research was sponsored
by Schenthal Biotech.

30:21.465 --> 30:25.744
It's a pharmaceutical company quoted
on the New York stock exchange.

30:25.745 --> 30:28.479
I know what it is; I was
just surprised you knew.

30:30.438 --> 30:35.564
There was some kind of scandal,
I seem to remember, about

30:38.042 --> 30:42.801
clinical tests involving
healthy human beings.

30:42.936 --> 30:45.064
You shouldn't believe everything you read.

30:45.114 --> 30:51.027
That's good advice. An
interesting field, medical ethics.

30:52.649 --> 30:56.988
Should we allow one person to
die if it saves lives of millions?

30:57.051 --> 30:59.031
Joseph Stalin wasn't a doctor.

30:59.105 --> 31:03.118
No, but he knew how to
liquidate his fellow men.

31:12.105 --> 31:14.225
I think we're ready to carve.

31:43.160 --> 31:47.237
Every action, equal and opposite.

31:48.008 --> 31:49.035
Reaction.

32:06.320 --> 32:10.771
Peace without turmoil.

32:37.320 --> 32:41.008
I put my hand upon you.

32:44.193 --> 32:50.040
I put my hand upon you.

33:01.259 --> 33:04.604
I am inside your sickness.

33:29.724 --> 33:30.859
Get a beer.

34:09.996 --> 34:14.467
Hey. I gave you two hundred.

34:15.722 --> 34:17.594
No, it... It was one.

34:17.860 --> 34:20.284
Oh, it was definitely two.

34:20.466 --> 34:22.588
You gave me one.

34:25.844 --> 34:30.931
It was green. Two hundred
Krone notes are green.

34:30.966 --> 34:32.766
You're currency expert too!

34:34.460 --> 34:37.521
Well, at least I can fucking count.

34:38.583 --> 34:42.719
You gave me one hundred.

34:45.141 --> 34:47.123
You forgot to add the milk.

35:25.691 --> 35:30.059
Governor? Michael Lennox.

35:30.129 --> 35:33.618
I'm only acting Governor.

35:34.250 --> 35:38.996
I was, err, wondering if I could
take a little bit of your time?

35:42.254 --> 35:43.990
This wine is awful.

35:44.326 --> 35:51.440
Isn't it though? Hong's
supermarket too! I'm shocked.

35:52.839 --> 35:54.878
You've made a remarkable recovery.

35:56.096 --> 35:57.691
From what I understand.

35:58.250 --> 36:00.479
He's a bit of an old woman.

36:00.572 --> 36:01.599
Who is?

36:01.743 --> 36:03.629
Dr. Adebimpe.

36:06.417 --> 36:08.429
Do you have any pains in
your left lower back at all?

36:08.484 --> 36:09.681
My left lower back?

36:09.716 --> 36:11.950
It's where the human liver is located.

36:18.324 --> 36:19.996
No. All good.

36:21.472 --> 36:23.337
What about the abdomen, generally?

36:23.372 --> 36:25.624
Never better. Generally.

36:25.659 --> 36:27.399
Nausea, vomiting?

36:27.553 --> 36:28.512
I wish.

36:28.547 --> 36:31.263
Where've you been for the
last nine weeks, Sheriff?

36:40.715 --> 36:42.286
You cunt.

37:03.582 --> 37:04.690
Eric.

37:05.554 --> 37:06.524
Michael.

37:06.601 --> 37:07.885
Did you need to see me?

37:07.971 --> 37:08.975
No.

37:11.036 --> 37:14.036
I was just wondering if
you've been fucking my wife?

37:20.596 --> 37:23.026
I think I would have remembered that.

37:35.761 --> 37:36.945
Calm the fuck down!

37:51.986 --> 37:56.172
Enough! Enough! Enough!

38:09.332 --> 38:10.527
Okay then.

38:16.997 --> 38:17.983
Dad?

39:26.722 --> 39:29.883
I called you this morning. I left messages.

39:31.187 --> 39:33.645
No, I am NOT fucking calm.

39:33.810 --> 39:36.465
I didn't sign up for this shit.

39:37.270 --> 39:41.262
There are bodies all over
the place. It's monstrous!

39:41.297 --> 39:42.948
Then you're fine.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.679
No, I need more money.

39:46.827 --> 39:51.302
No, he, he thinks it's all about
drugs or something like that,

39:51.364 --> 39:58.040
he knows nothing, he's an idiot,
that's why we made him Sheriff.

40:00.920 --> 40:06.759
No. Oslo knows nothing,
neither does she, don't worry.

40:06.881 --> 40:11.560
No. She, she came to me this
morning with some story about Russia.

40:11.623 --> 40:13.959
It's a joke.

40:14.066 --> 40:17.581
It's under control, but I need more money.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.659
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, I mean it.

40:41.164 --> 40:42.889
I'm sorry about that.

40:46.622 --> 40:50.245
Ah! It wasn't your fault, forget it.

40:50.366 --> 40:53.633
No, I feel bad. Let me buy you a drink.

40:53.712 --> 40:57.839
No, no, no need. Really. Good night.

40:57.987 --> 41:01.351
Now, I feel really bad.

41:18.989 --> 41:25.050
I had such a lovely time. Good night.

41:46.417 --> 41:47.569
What?

41:48.689 --> 41:51.380
Didn't you hear that?
Something moved out there.

41:52.846 --> 41:55.205
What? Like an animal?

41:55.340 --> 41:57.319
It tried the handle of the half track.

41:57.421 --> 41:58.621
Are you sure?

42:08.217 --> 42:10.047
No... What are you... Don't go out.

42:11.077 --> 42:12.338
I could do that.

42:12.534 --> 42:16.719
But I'd sit in here all night scared
shitless and trying to stay awake.

42:17.156 --> 42:18.685
Fucking chopper.

42:20.347 --> 42:21.512
Don't go out!

42:22.565 --> 42:24.107
Zip up after me.

42:50.585 --> 42:51.982
Natalie?

42:55.805 --> 42:57.045
Nothing out there?

43:03.742 --> 43:06.320
I need you to stop fucking
about, zip the tent up.

43:23.262 --> 43:24.513
Natalie...

43:46.529 --> 43:54.913
Tell me about Dan Andersson.
Everything you know.

44:55.273 --> 44:56.644
_

44:56.718 --> 44:58.148
- POLICE!
- SHOW YOURSELF!

45:02.357 --> 45:05.205
I want this killer found. The killer!

45:05.352 --> 45:09.536
The one killer in Fortitude!
