Discretion is advised.

00:14.958 --> 00:19.958
This story is a replica
of the original.

00:21.041 --> 00:22.125

00:22.333 --> 00:23.416

01:10.916 --> 01:12.916
One, two, three!

01:21.541 --> 01:22.791
One!

01:32.750 --> 01:36.208
One, two!
One, two, three, four!

01:37.208 --> 01:41.041
Juan always said he didn't believe
anything from History class.

01:41.208 --> 01:43.333
Or books, for that matter.

01:43.458 --> 01:47.416
How could they be so sure
what Hernan Cortes thought...

01:47.791 --> 01:50.625
...or Montezuma,
or Alexander the Great?

01:50.916 --> 01:53.041
He said it was all made up.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.250
He said no one could know
why someone did what they did...

01:57.583 --> 01:59.500
...except for the person
who did it.

01:59.666 --> 02:01.791
And more often than not,
not even them.

02:02.041 --> 02:03.041
Water.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.791
Skies crisscrossed by clouds.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.249
Silent mountains.

02:08.499 --> 02:11.041
Elements controlled by Tlaloc.

02:12.458 --> 02:18.166
For centuries, the 300 A.D. monolith
slumbered in a ravine.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.166
Juan told me about the time
when some engineers...

02:21.416 --> 02:24.833
...took the god Tlaloc
away from his home.

02:25.583 --> 02:30.708
People were angry and sad,
but they took him anyway.

02:31.166 --> 02:34.250
Without asking for permission
or forgiveness.

02:36.458 --> 02:40.833
On the huge platform
powered by 860 hp...

02:41.083 --> 02:44.541
...the god's transportation
took place over two stages.

02:44.833 --> 02:48.791
From the shores of Texcoco Lake
to the Chapultepec Forest.

02:49.208 --> 02:54.833
Power and telephone cables
had to be removed along the way.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.208
And all because
they had to fill...

02:58.291 --> 03:01.833
...the new anthropology museum
with old things.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.291
The city was lit up...

03:09.583 --> 03:13.291
...as Tlaloc traversed it
in his immortal slumber.

03:13.708 --> 03:16.833
Witnessing the centuries-old
journey of the god...

03:17.083 --> 03:22.625
...hundreds of thousands
watched in awe and curiosity.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.166
- Photo!
- Stop it, stop.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.416
- Get down.
- Oh, sweetie.

03:33.833 --> 03:36.333
Soon after the museum opened,
Juan's father...

03:36.416 --> 03:39.583
...took Juan to see Tlaloc
and told him about the plunder.

03:39.916 --> 03:42.875
- Honey, please smile.
- I'm smiling.

03:43.625 --> 03:45.666
Juan was five years old.

03:47.458 --> 03:51.250
- Smile, Juan! Show your teeth!
- He never forgot the story.

03:53.291 --> 03:57.750
"Death is our eternal companion"

03:59.291 --> 04:02.458
"Always to our left"

04:02.791 --> 04:07.375
"An arm's distance away"

04:20.583 --> 04:23.750
The first time I visited the museum,
back in eighth grade...

04:23.833 --> 04:27.166
...I had to copy the captions
next to the pieces...

04:27.625 --> 04:31.541
...and get my notebook stamped
to prove I had been there.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.583
I heard stories about
the creation, and wars...

04:35.833 --> 04:38.458
...and about the things
that used to be here.

04:38.750 --> 04:44.458
"It whispers in your ear
You felt its icy touch"

04:45.458 --> 04:51.166
"The way you felt it today"

04:52.458 --> 04:53.958
But I don't remember
any of it.

04:55.791 --> 05:02.750
"It has always been
Watching over you"

05:06.583 --> 05:10.125
"And it always will"

05:14.583 --> 05:16.416
Next piece, please.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.083
Turn it off.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.041
Turn it off.

05:28.750 --> 05:29.958
Juan.

05:30.458 --> 05:31.666
Juan!

05:32.250 --> 05:33.958
- Turn off the light!
- Sorry, sorry.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.333
The year of the earthquake,
Juan spent the summer...

05:36.583 --> 05:38.958
...working at the museum
to pay for his weed.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.125
Every day for three months
they took photographs...

05:42.333 --> 05:45.125
...of each object
at the Maya room.

05:45.666 --> 05:48.250
And it seemed
they'd never finish.

05:50.833 --> 05:53.125
Rotate it counterclockwise,
please.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.750
What are you doing?
No touching without gloves!

05:58.000 --> 06:01.875
Juan, if you touch a piece again,
I'm sending you home.

06:05.541 --> 06:09.208
Juan used to say it was impossible
to know how things start...

06:09.500 --> 06:12.208
...we can only know
how they end...

06:12.541 --> 06:14.166
...once they've ended.

06:14.708 --> 06:19.041
I don't know if those photos
were the beginning of it all.

06:21.541 --> 06:23.333
I don't know.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.500
Where does an idea begin?

06:32.666 --> 06:34.208
Who can tell?

07:24.666 --> 07:31.625
MUSEUM

08:19.833 --> 08:22.625
Wilson. Wilson.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.041
- Shoot.
- I said no.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.125
- Shoot.
- I don't want to.

08:28.291 --> 08:31.083
- Shoot.
- Cut it out.

08:31.166 --> 08:34.332
Ciudad Satelite,
23 km from Mexico City.

08:34.874 --> 08:37.957
Shoot!

08:38.749 --> 08:39.957
Shoot!

08:40.541 --> 08:41.791
Shoot!

08:42.874 --> 08:44.583
- Shoot, you bastard!
- I'm leaving.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.708
- Shoot, you bastard!
- I'm leaving.

08:47.333 --> 08:51.541
- First we finish this, I told you how.
- I'm taking my dad to the doctor.

08:51.708 --> 08:55.583
- Either shoot or stand here.
- I don't want to, I'm serious.

09:04.208 --> 09:07.000
Alexander the Great had
diamond-tipped arrows made for him.

09:07.250 --> 09:10.083
They could go through
a Mongol's head.

09:10.916 --> 09:13.416
These arrows couldn't
puncture a cat's head...

09:13.875 --> 09:15.958
...but they'll pierce the cube.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.541
But what's the point?

09:19.958 --> 09:22.583
I need to know
I can trust you.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.666
You can.

09:50.375 --> 09:51.875
- What are you doing, asshole?
- You moved!

09:52.125 --> 09:53.750
- You could've hit me in the eye!
- You told me to do it!

09:54.000 --> 09:56.041
- You could've hit me in the eye!
- What happened?

09:56.291 --> 09:58.083
- Nothing.
- Wilson shot at my head.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.541
- Why did you shoot at his head?
- It's not true.

10:00.791 --> 10:02.375
- I thought I could trust you.
- You can.

10:02.583 --> 10:05.500
- So, why did you shoot at me?
- Why did you shoot at him?

10:05.750 --> 10:07.541
I didn't.

10:07.791 --> 10:10.375
Shorty, they're fighting out there.
Lalo doesn't want to pay.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.291
Who said you could
call me that?

10:12.583 --> 10:14.375
I'd go out if I were you,
Shorty.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.291
- I thought I could trust you.
- You can.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.666
So why did you shoot me
in the head?

10:25.541 --> 10:26.375
Can I borrow it?

10:26.458 --> 10:27.291
THE HARD LIFE OF AN EASY WOMAN

10:28.250 --> 10:32.208
No, Scherezada Rios stays here.
It's a hard one to find.

10:33.541 --> 10:37.166
All right, if you don't pay,
you can't play.

10:38.041 --> 10:39.291
What's up, Lalo?

10:39.625 --> 10:42.375
Lalo has been playing
and hasn't paid yet.

10:42.625 --> 10:46.208
Pay up, Lalo, don't be a dick.
Oh, you don't want to pay?

10:46.958 --> 10:50.791
In that case, move it.
Move aside, let me--

10:51.791 --> 10:53.541
Is that level 15?

10:54.541 --> 10:55.791
Wait a minute.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.958
I'll cover you.

10:59.208 --> 11:03.541
But just this once, got it?
We can't set a precedent, Camila.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.041
This isn't a game, fuckers.
We must think like the enemy.

11:09.416 --> 11:11.416
As if we came from another planet.

11:12.125 --> 11:15.541
When King Pakal returns in his ship
and everything comes to an end...

11:15.708 --> 11:18.125
...don't say I didn't warn you,
you little shits.

11:18.833 --> 11:21.500
- Juan, you're still here?
- No!

11:21.583 --> 11:23.916
They're waiting for you!

11:24.291 --> 11:28.083
- Ben, are you staying for dinner?
- I can't, my dad needs me.

11:28.333 --> 11:31.583
- How is he doing?
- Good, they put him on oxygen.

11:31.875 --> 11:34.958
I'm really sorry.
Give him one of the fruitcakes.

11:35.250 --> 11:38.625
- My daughter made them.
- Don't use English words, Mom.

11:39.041 --> 11:41.625
You can say fruitcake
in Spanish, you know?

11:41.875 --> 11:44.583
Julio is waiting for you.
It's about the--

11:47.333 --> 11:48.583
The Santa costume?

11:48.958 --> 11:53.083
- I don't want to, Mom.
- Juan, come here.

11:53.916 --> 11:57.500
No, Juan, I keep tucking it in,
but it's still too big on you.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.541
It's hard to believe you are
Dr. Juan's grandson.

12:01.083 --> 12:05.041
You should dress as an elf,
it would fit you better.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.166
They've informed us that
the Modern Art Museum...

12:09.416 --> 12:12.291
...and the Anthropology Museum
will remain closed...

12:12.541 --> 12:15.041
...from today until
January 5th...

12:15.291 --> 12:17.916
...while a new ventilation system
is being installed.

12:18.166 --> 12:21.958
They're working day and night
to be ready when school starts.

12:22.291 --> 12:26.666
So, this holiday season
there will be no museums.

12:26.958 --> 12:29.625
- Can I use your phone?
- Wait, don't move yet.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.958
- Let me finish.
- It's fine like this.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.750
Put it on Mom's tab!

12:38.416 --> 12:39.500
GUARDHOUSE

12:42.583 --> 12:43.583
ACETONE

12:44.166 --> 12:45.041
HARDWARE STORE

12:50.291 --> 12:52.083
- Duct tape?
- Yes, duct tape.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.833
- How many nails?
- A bunch.

12:54.083 --> 12:57.291
- Thin copper wire, six meters.
- Six meters copper wire.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.041
That's too much.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.041
- Alligators?
- What are those?

13:01.291 --> 13:03.791
Oh, the crocodiles!
Yes, I'll take a few.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.125
- Do you have any acetone?
- What?

13:09.541 --> 13:10.791
Ether?

13:13.666 --> 13:15.416
Since Juan was a kid,
every Christmas...

13:15.666 --> 13:20.250
...his grandfather dressed as Santa
and gave out presents after dinner.

13:21.333 --> 13:25.250
He died that year, so everyone
agreed Juan would take over.

13:25.833 --> 13:29.250
Juan protested, saying he'd rather
dress as Quetzatcoatl...

13:30.125 --> 13:34.500
...because Santa Claus was a tool
to indoctrinate kids into capitalism.

13:34.833 --> 13:37.125
His protests went ignored.

13:41.833 --> 13:43.458
Take a deep breath.

13:59.666 --> 14:00.916
Get dressed.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.000
Your blood pressure
and resting heart rate are high.

14:05.500 --> 14:09.125
- I'm prescribing you some pills.
- You did that already.

14:10.291 --> 14:11.541
Hey, Dad...

14:13.208 --> 14:15.708
I need to use your car,
can I borrow it?

14:16.125 --> 14:19.375
I have something important to do
after Christmas dinner.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.125
What are we going to do
with you, bud?

14:23.375 --> 14:26.791
I already paid the deposit
for the place at the mall.

14:27.333 --> 14:31.875
- I'm pretty much set to go.
- You're not a veterinarian yet.

14:33.125 --> 14:35.583
I know that.
I'm graduating soon.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.541
- I'm not like Uncle Oscar.
- Did you pick up the suit?

14:40.916 --> 14:45.916
Yeah, I even got it tailored.
It's going to fit great.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.708
Dad?

14:56.916 --> 14:58.666
Am I dying soon, Dad?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.750
Yes?

15:02.583 --> 15:04.291
Yes, sweetie, show her in.

15:07.625 --> 15:11.000
So I guess I'll see you
tonight, yeah?

15:12.375 --> 15:14.375
You'll be there, right?

15:18.208 --> 15:20.250
- I just filled the tank.
- Thanks.

15:20.583 --> 15:23.458
- Thank you.
- Hey, Chiva.

15:24.250 --> 15:28.291
- Time for you annual drug test?
- Anal, yes. Pretty wild.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.458
Try it, you might like it.

15:30.708 --> 15:34.583
- Dad said work calls only.
- What? What did Dad say?

15:34.916 --> 15:37.666
- What did he say?
- Let go of me, asshole.

16:17.666 --> 16:19.041
- Hello?
- Wilson?

16:19.666 --> 16:21.791
Where have you been all day?
It has to be tonight.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.458
What?

16:23.791 --> 16:25.833
What do you mean "what"?

16:26.583 --> 16:29.583
- But it's Christmas.
- So?

16:30.041 --> 16:33.250
- You said the 31st.
- It has to be tonight.

16:33.541 --> 16:37.125
- You said New Year's Eve.
- I just saw the news.

16:37.208 --> 16:41.166
Repairs start tomorrow,
it's going to be crowded.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.208
- It has to be tonight.
- Are we even ready?

16:43.291 --> 16:45.208
Sure we're ready,
we've gone over and over it.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.916
I already called Bosco,
I got the car, everything.

16:49.416 --> 16:52.625
Yeah, but I can't tonight.
I'm having dinner with Dad.

16:52.708 --> 16:55.375
I'm not asking, moron.

16:55.625 --> 16:59.625
I'm not asking you to fucking prom.
You're coming tonight.

16:59.875 --> 17:03.375
I guess we'll have to see
because...

17:03.708 --> 17:06.665
...the doctor said it might be
his last Christmas.

17:07.665 --> 17:11.083
Look, I'll see you at midnight
at the usual place.

17:11.374 --> 17:13.665
- Yes, Juan.
- Don't be late.

17:13.749 --> 17:15.249
We'll see.

17:15.458 --> 17:16.665
Hello?

17:17.040 --> 17:19.915
- What are you up to, Shorty?
- Nothing.

17:20.083 --> 17:22.624
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.
Catch a tiger by the toe.

17:22.915 --> 17:25.540
If he hollers, let him go.

17:25.790 --> 17:28.583
One, two, three, four...

17:29.000 --> 17:31.500
One, two...

17:31.875 --> 17:35.958
Why don't you hide here?
Get under the table.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.041
No one will find you.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.458
I saw you, under the chair!

17:40.708 --> 17:42.291
You're mistaken,
there's no one here.

17:42.541 --> 17:45.625
Hey, have you met
Oscar's girlfriend?

17:45.916 --> 17:50.583
- He has a girlfriend?
- Why else ask for another seat?

17:51.125 --> 17:53.916
- What?
- There's no more ham.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.375
Don't fill up with snacks.
Wait a little.

17:57.625 --> 18:00.666
Have some cheese and olives.
Don't fill up before dinner.

18:00.916 --> 18:03.958
- She's his student!?
- We'll meet her soon.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.000
- What is this stuff?
- It's pâté, thank you very much.

18:13.041 --> 18:16.333
Hello! Merry Christmas!
This is Gaby.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.208
Gaby, my family.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.875
- Who's your guest?
- This is Gaby.

18:21.208 --> 18:23.541
- Introduce us.
- Hello.

18:23.708 --> 18:26.083
- My brother.
- Nice to meet you.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.875
- Uncle Oscar, how are you?
- I'm fine.

18:29.291 --> 18:30.875
I'll take your bag.

18:31.416 --> 18:34.416
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- The lady of the house.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.333
- My niece.
- Susana!

18:37.583 --> 18:41.208
- It's Christmas, they're dating.
- Precisely, it's Christmas!

18:41.500 --> 18:44.666
Good evening, sir.
I brought bread and cider.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.833
This one has a bite mark!

18:55.250 --> 18:58.166
- Neto was hungry.
- Must've been the baker!

18:58.416 --> 19:01.458
- Did you taste that one, too!
- No, it's unopened!

19:02.208 --> 19:04.500
- Really, it is!
- He says it's unopened.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.291
Shorty, where are you going
with those bags?

19:24.541 --> 19:26.416
- It's your kids, chopped up.
- Asshole.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.416
- I'm dumping them in the dam.
- Don't joke about that!

19:29.708 --> 19:32.666
- What do you want, chipmunk?
- Dad asked why you're here...

19:32.916 --> 19:34.708
...instead of downstairs,
with everyone.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.291
Why do you always
isolate yourself?

19:37.583 --> 19:39.833
- Aren't you happy?
- It's Christmas, why would I be happy?

19:40.125 --> 19:42.416
You should be thankful,
you have a family.

19:42.708 --> 19:46.166
- Some people don't, but you do.
- Thank you, family.

19:46.416 --> 19:49.416
Are you doing Grandpa's thing?
Did the suit fit you?

19:49.833 --> 19:51.250
I bet it didn't.

19:51.500 --> 19:56.041
It was too big on you.
I'm sure it looks huge on you.

19:56.458 --> 19:59.250
If it was green instead,
you'd be a nice elf.

19:59.541 --> 20:03.333
If you do it, do it right.
It's very important you do it right.

20:03.625 --> 20:07.041
- Don't screw up.
- You smell like period blood.

20:07.458 --> 20:10.500
You smell like baby shit,
you fucking dwarf.

20:23.208 --> 20:25.041
Make way for the turkey!

20:29.541 --> 20:31.833
Give a round of applause for the cook!

20:32.875 --> 20:34.375
Everyone, hush!

20:34.666 --> 20:36.500
- Please, sit down.
- Children, sit down!

20:40.666 --> 20:43.125
I just want to say...

20:44.166 --> 20:47.208
...that this has been
a terrible year.

20:48.125 --> 20:53.791
I want you to join me in a toast
to someone very special...

20:55.500 --> 20:58.083
...to my father.
Thank you, cheers!

20:58.375 --> 21:00.958
- Cheers, cheers.
- To Grandpa!

21:01.333 --> 21:04.375
- To Grandpa.
- And to your joy as well.

21:04.666 --> 21:07.625
And to the joys
this year brought us!

21:08.416 --> 21:10.291
...its scales will dry up.

21:10.666 --> 21:16.041
No, Keiko means "lucky one,"
it doesn't bring you luck.

21:16.958 --> 21:19.625
So kids can see it!
It was in Sea Wo--

21:19.916 --> 21:21.916
- It was in Sea World, right?
- Norway.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.125
- It was in Norway.
- In the sea.

21:24.375 --> 21:26.125
- Norway?
- Yeah, right?

21:26.416 --> 21:29.000
It's so that people
can have a good time.

21:29.250 --> 21:32.125
We went there recently.
We loved it, it was great.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.125
But he was asking why
bring it now?

21:35.333 --> 21:38.250
It definitely has to be
a smoke screen.

21:38.708 --> 21:42.791
The park can do whatever
they like with their money.

21:43.625 --> 21:48.166
- It's a private company.
- The government can't interfere.

21:48.458 --> 21:51.208
But how can you deny
state involvement...

21:51.583 --> 21:53.875
...if they closed up
the freeway...

21:54.125 --> 21:59.333
...so that two huge trucks could
move the orca to the park...

21:59.833 --> 22:02.916
- ...before its scales dried up?
- Whales don't have scales.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.791
- Got it?
- Having fun in the Pacific...

22:07.083 --> 22:10.291
...and waking up in Mexico City
is not good luck.

22:10.583 --> 22:13.416
But why do it now?

22:13.666 --> 22:17.166
Why, at this point for the country,
with the peso as low as it is...

22:17.541 --> 22:20.375
...and ties between the cartels
and the government?

22:20.583 --> 22:23.916
- Enlighten us, Juan.
- Juan, do you know about orcas?

22:24.458 --> 22:27.500
- What?
- About orcas, like Keiko.

22:27.833 --> 22:31.416
Hey, Christmas, right here!
We're having a conversation.

22:31.791 --> 22:34.833
Don't worry, you can go
play Atari with the kids...

22:35.083 --> 22:38.250
...while the rest of us grown ups
talk about politics.

22:38.625 --> 22:41.166
- Keiko will die there.
- It will?

22:41.416 --> 22:44.625
Then, they'll chop him up
and sell him outside the park.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.875
Yeah, fish tacos!

22:49.375 --> 22:52.333
Did you know they live
with their mothers?

22:52.625 --> 22:54.958
All their lives,
especially males.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.708
- They stay with their moms.
- So you're an orca?

23:00.166 --> 23:02.500
Is your thesis about whales,
Shorty?

23:03.166 --> 23:05.250
It's been nine years.

23:05.541 --> 23:09.291
Wait, he's been doing
field practice for nine years...

23:09.541 --> 23:12.125
...and his dissertation
is about masturbation.

23:12.583 --> 23:16.041
- What? Tell them.
- What will the title be?

23:16.500 --> 23:18.375
Are you leaving?

23:19.333 --> 23:22.291
- Don't go!
- What's the title?

23:22.541 --> 23:25.125
"Masturbatory habits
in Ciudad Satelite."

23:25.333 --> 23:28.250
- It's Christmas, can't we have fun?
- But he started it!

23:28.500 --> 23:30.333
We're all having fun!

23:48.458 --> 23:49.291
What?

23:49.375 --> 23:50.791
Shorty, it's time for the family picture.

23:51.041 --> 23:54.250
I know, I'm coming.
Give me a minute.

23:55.708 --> 23:59.375
Hey, would you like to see
something spectacular?

23:59.666 --> 24:01.291
You would?

24:01.625 --> 24:03.916
- Know where Santa's presents are?
- Where?

24:04.166 --> 24:05.666
Right here.

24:05.958 --> 24:07.333
You're lying.

24:08.291 --> 24:09.625
Look.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.333
Let's see here.

24:14.458 --> 24:15.958
Do you see this?

24:16.375 --> 24:19.625
This one's for Iker,
this one's for Pilar.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.125
This one's for you, Lalo!
Should we open it?

24:27.291 --> 24:29.416
A Millennium Falcon!

24:30.375 --> 24:33.041
What a lucky kid!
Isn't it great?

24:36.416 --> 24:40.375
I saw your mom come in
and leave them here.

24:41.375 --> 24:43.458
Do you know what
that means?

24:47.500 --> 24:48.958
All right, then.

24:51.416 --> 24:52.916
Think about it.

25:04.583 --> 25:08.833
Santa's coming soon. Whoever is
not in the photo gets no present.

25:09.291 --> 25:12.958
- You won't fit in the frame!
- Nephew, come here.

25:13.416 --> 25:16.291
Did I tell you about the fire
at your grandparents' house?

25:16.833 --> 25:19.750
Only about a hundred times.

25:20.166 --> 25:24.791
She doesn't know this one,
so act surprised.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.125
This ingrate's grandparents,
meaning my parents...

25:28.375 --> 25:32.208
...had a house in Novelist St.
It was really cool!

25:32.916 --> 25:36.583
It was a modernist house,
one of the biggest in Satelite.

25:36.875 --> 25:39.500
It was actually built by
Mario Pani in the '50s...

25:39.791 --> 25:41.958
...back when all this
was empty hills.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.625
Hey, what's going on?
Are you in a hurry?

25:44.875 --> 25:46.500
Just tell the story already.

25:46.750 --> 25:49.416
Why do I love this one
if he's so rude?

25:49.666 --> 25:50.916
Wow!

25:51.875 --> 25:53.833
- Cool!
- These are Legos!

25:54.166 --> 25:58.250
- It's the one I wanted!
- Yes! Battleship!

26:00.083 --> 26:01.666
I can make a polar bear!

26:02.041 --> 26:03.625
What's all this?

26:04.125 --> 26:06.041
What's going on, Pilar?

26:06.541 --> 26:08.291
You're the oldest,
what happened?

26:08.541 --> 26:11.291
- Juan.
- Juan told Lalo to open the gifts.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.708
- He said they were here.
- Eduardo, come here!

26:14.000 --> 26:15.416
Come here!

26:15.958 --> 26:19.291
Give me that.
What did Juan tell you?

26:19.583 --> 26:22.458
He said the presents were here
and we could open them.

26:23.416 --> 26:26.666
- And you told everyone?
- He said I could.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.125
- Was that nice?
- No.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.708
Don't you laugh
or I'll smack your mouth!

26:31.041 --> 26:34.125
Anyway, back in 1959,
that house burned down.

26:34.458 --> 26:39.375
The ground floor was lost,
furniture, curtains, all of it.

26:39.625 --> 26:43.916
We were in pajamas on the street,
watching it go up in flames.

26:44.208 --> 26:46.500
The fire department came,
so did the police.

26:46.791 --> 26:48.791
They even wrote about it
in the newspaper.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.708
And do you know
why it burned down?

26:52.708 --> 26:56.791
- You left the stereo on.
- That's the official version.

26:57.125 --> 27:00.791
What actually happened
was entirely different.

27:01.208 --> 27:04.041
- You bastard!
- Hey, Adriana!

27:04.291 --> 27:08.125
Mom, your son told my kids
that Santa's not real...

27:08.375 --> 27:09.583
...and where we hid
the presents!

27:09.750 --> 27:12.041
- No, I didn't.
- Are you serious?

27:12.291 --> 27:15.291
- Yes, you did!
- I didn't "say" it.

27:15.750 --> 27:18.041
- I didn't tell him!
- You're a fucking moron!

27:18.333 --> 27:21.625
- You fucking moron!
- Hey, hey, calm down.

27:21.833 --> 27:24.166
Do you even know how much
Santa means to them?

27:24.500 --> 27:26.750
- Listen to me!
- Enough of that! Stop!

27:35.791 --> 27:39.583
When Juan left that night,
he never returned again.

27:44.375 --> 27:48.125
Someone who looked like him
came back, but it wasn't him.

27:51.166 --> 27:54.958
Good girl, yes you are.
Where's this moron?

27:55.333 --> 27:57.000
Where is this moron?

28:31.708 --> 28:35.333
Since we were kids,
Juan and I had our usual place.

28:35.625 --> 28:39.208
Only we knew where
the usual place was.

28:39.583 --> 28:43.916
- Where have you been?
- You said midnight sharp.

28:44.583 --> 28:48.416
I was at the usual place
at midnight sharp.

28:50.166 --> 28:52.333
I thought you weren't coming.

28:52.875 --> 28:56.708
- Yes, Juan, I'm here.
- I see that.

28:57.541 --> 29:00.125
When we got into college,
an old friend of Juan's...

29:00.333 --> 29:03.208
...called Pepe Soto
took us out to celebrate.

29:03.458 --> 29:05.833
On the way back,
Juan stopped at that sign...

29:06.083 --> 29:08.250
...and painted the name
of our profession.

29:08.541 --> 29:11.833
He said it was insulting that
there was even an Actors St...

29:12.083 --> 29:16.333
...and not a single street in Satelite
to honor our noble field.

29:16.416 --> 29:17.458
VETERINARIANS

29:18.208 --> 29:19.583
Here.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.750
Merry Christmas.

29:29.250 --> 29:31.250
The Night of the Mayas.

29:33.500 --> 29:34.958
Thanks, Juan.

29:37.166 --> 29:40.750
I saw your dad through the window,
he looked better.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.333
What time will we get
back home?

29:58.125 --> 30:00.125
Don't start with that.

30:13.833 --> 30:16.583
From this point on,
there's no turning back.

30:17.166 --> 30:18.708
Yes, Juan.

30:19.708 --> 30:23.208
We're no longer like
our stupid families.

30:23.708 --> 30:24.916
Yes.

30:27.416 --> 30:29.666
No one has ever
done this before.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.833
Do you understand?

30:33.208 --> 30:34.833
Yes, Juan.

30:36.416 --> 30:38.958
You told me
I could trust you.

30:40.375 --> 30:42.000
You can.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.708
I know.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.208
Let's go.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.000
Wilson!

31:02.166 --> 31:03.541
Wilson!

31:07.041 --> 31:08.208
Go, go, go.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.750
This stinks like ass.

32:01.708 --> 32:03.666
Make do, Wilson.

34:29.166 --> 34:31.291
Are you sure?

34:31.583 --> 34:32.833
I am.

34:34.208 --> 34:35.916
Eighty percent.

34:38.916 --> 34:40.708
Sixty percent.

34:43.666 --> 34:47.166
- There's no alarm, trust me.
- How could there not be?

42:53.083 --> 42:55.000
The headdress, too?

42:55.375 --> 42:56.916
No.

42:57.500 --> 42:59.875
Someone beat us to it.

43:00.125 --> 43:03.750
The original... is in Austria.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.041
Do we care?

44:39.791 --> 44:41.458
Stop it, stop.

46:11.750 --> 46:13.083
What happened?

46:14.750 --> 46:16.000
It's Pakal.

46:16.250 --> 46:18.166
- What?
- It's Pakal!

46:21.916 --> 46:23.166
Juan?

46:37.375 --> 46:39.291
Juan, are you OK?

46:39.708 --> 46:41.625
What's going on, man?

46:43.833 --> 46:45.500
Just breathe.

46:46.666 --> 46:48.500
Juan, just breathe.

46:49.333 --> 46:51.083
We're almost out.

47:22.166 --> 47:27.000
Do you realize, Wilson?
Benjamin, do you realize?

47:28.125 --> 47:30.083
Did you ever imagine?

47:30.458 --> 47:33.333
Did you ever imagine!?
We fucking rule!

47:33.416 --> 47:36.250
We fucking rule!
We fucking rule, Wilson!

47:36.500 --> 47:39.375
- I have to pee.
- We fucking rule!

47:39.916 --> 47:41.583
I have to pee.

47:42.416 --> 47:44.416
We're almost there, Wilson!

47:45.208 --> 47:47.416
- I have to pee.
- Hold it.

47:47.791 --> 47:50.041
- I have to pee right now.
- Wilson, hey!

47:50.416 --> 47:52.125
What the fuck are you doing?!

47:54.916 --> 47:56.291
Wilson!

47:58.333 --> 47:59.750
Wilson!

48:01.000 --> 48:02.416
Wilson!

48:11.000 --> 48:13.125
I've always wanted
to do this.

48:13.458 --> 48:15.541
Look at you,
fucking Wilson!

48:16.083 --> 48:19.000
Do you realize?
You're the king of Satelite!

48:21.208 --> 48:23.166
I mean, we both are.

48:25.083 --> 48:28.500
We are the Aztec kings
of Naucalpan.

48:29.750 --> 48:31.000
Wow.

48:33.416 --> 48:35.083
- So?
- So what?

48:35.375 --> 48:37.625
- Now what?
- Now, we celebrate.

48:37.875 --> 48:40.750
But we're taking them to Bosco
so he can sell them, right?

48:41.000 --> 48:43.750
He did tell you he could
sell them, didn't he?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.666
- Is that all you care about?
- Is it true?

48:47.083 --> 48:51.791
Shit, just let me enjoy this.
You sound like my dad.

48:53.208 --> 48:54.666
Sorry, Juan.

48:57.333 --> 48:58.750
But, did he?

49:31.041 --> 49:34.958
So that's the official version about
the fire at your grandparents'.

49:35.416 --> 49:38.583
But what really happened...

49:39.000 --> 49:41.458
...was something
entirely different.

49:43.958 --> 49:48.333
Your dad had met your mother
shortly before the fire.

49:49.583 --> 49:54.000
He never disobeyed our dad,
except in those days.

49:55.500 --> 49:58.083
He went rebellious on us.

49:58.500 --> 50:00.125
That night...

50:00.416 --> 50:03.916
...while everyone slept,
he brought her home.

50:04.250 --> 50:08.666
Right there in the living room,
what better place, right?

50:09.250 --> 50:11.375
And then he... you know.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.208
Your mother has always been
a very attractive woman.

50:16.833 --> 50:21.250
Anyway, long story short,
once he finished banging her...

50:21.500 --> 50:26.541
...he forgot to put out the candles
he had lit to set the mood.

50:27.083 --> 50:30.791
And when he came back,
the living room was on fire.

50:31.250 --> 50:35.250
His first thought was to wake me,
looking scared shitless...

50:36.125 --> 50:37.875
...and that's when...

50:38.666 --> 50:41.666
...when we agreed
I'd take the blame for it.

50:43.166 --> 50:46.625
I called the fire department
and we woke everyone up.

50:50.500 --> 50:52.041
Why?

50:52.333 --> 50:55.375
Back then, I was always
playing my Bach records...

50:55.666 --> 50:58.541
...and I always forgot
to turn off the stereo.

50:59.458 --> 51:02.625
Dad used to get angry,
he said it would catch fire...

51:02.958 --> 51:05.541
...so no one ever
questioned the story.

51:06.291 --> 51:07.916
Besides, well...

51:09.250 --> 51:11.750
...by then I had already
dropped out of school...

51:12.125 --> 51:15.916
...and had gone in and out
of the hospital.

51:16.291 --> 51:18.958
I had even gotten Nelly
pregnant.

51:21.333 --> 51:23.500
No one expected
anything else from me...

51:23.750 --> 51:25.541
...so that's what I gave them.

51:25.875 --> 51:27.958
I don't know why, nephew...

51:28.416 --> 51:30.541
...and I hope I'm wrong...

51:31.000 --> 51:34.750
...but it seems you're walking
near the monster pit...

51:35.041 --> 51:37.000
...and if you fall in...

51:37.666 --> 51:43.291
...and the monsters grab you,
they won't ever let you go.

51:48.041 --> 51:50.416
What did you think of Gaby?

51:51.291 --> 51:53.208
She's hot, right?

51:55.333 --> 51:57.416
I bet you'd fuck her.

52:04.083 --> 52:05.333
Yes.

52:28.750 --> 52:30.458
Hey, Dad.

52:32.458 --> 52:34.333
What's going on?

52:36.625 --> 52:38.416
Are you all right?

52:40.125 --> 52:42.375
Did you have
trouble sleeping?

52:46.416 --> 52:48.041
What?

52:51.375 --> 52:52.916
What?

54:10.750 --> 54:13.250
Where were you, Shorty?
Have you seen the news?

54:13.583 --> 54:17.291
- Where were you, son?
- I asked Benjamin to stay for lunch.

54:17.375 --> 54:20.333
The thieves knew the value
of the pieces...

54:20.666 --> 54:24.500
...as they took the ones easiest
to transport and hide.

54:24.750 --> 54:27.666
Some of the most
valuable of all time.

54:27.958 --> 54:31.125
Pieces like the ones
I've just described...

54:31.375 --> 54:33.958
...have been stolen
by criminals...

54:34.208 --> 54:38.791
...probably linked to cultural
trafficking rings...

54:39.041 --> 54:42.250
...that threaten every
museum in the world.

54:42.833 --> 54:46.500
The National Institute of
Anthropology and History...

54:46.791 --> 54:53.583
...warns Mexico of these thieves,
enemies of their past and heritage.

54:53.666 --> 54:57.833
All Mexicans are called upon
to rally against...

54:58.166 --> 55:01.250
...this act of shameful,
unpatriotic theft.

55:03.250 --> 55:05.791
It's been one thing after
another, what a year!

55:06.083 --> 55:09.458
How do you steal so many pieces?
Where were the guards?

55:09.666 --> 55:13.833
- Culture's budget keeps being cut.
- Will you let me hear?

55:16.375 --> 55:23.333
The value of these pieces is
inestimable in monetary terms.

55:24.125 --> 55:29.000
Rather, their value is
cultural and artistic.

55:30.041 --> 55:32.166
In other news, earthquake rescue crews...

55:32.250 --> 55:33.541
Turn it off.

55:34.250 --> 55:38.416
- They didn't say their worth.
- They did, they're priceless.

55:38.875 --> 55:42.291
- You can't put a price on them.
- They don't know how.

55:42.541 --> 55:48.208
How could they know?
It's our history.

55:48.500 --> 55:54.208
Our heritage, our culture,
that's their only value.

55:54.500 --> 55:58.291
Those who did it are miserable
bastards with no past or future.

55:58.541 --> 56:02.375
I hope they rot in their own
curse, their own stupidity.

56:03.375 --> 56:05.750
They are the dark shit
of this country.

56:07.833 --> 56:11.166
When they catch them,
it is our solemn duty...

56:11.416 --> 56:13.833
...to whip them
in the main square.

56:14.083 --> 56:18.375
And drag their damned bodies
until they bleed out.

56:18.708 --> 56:20.750
Sons of bitches!

56:28.583 --> 56:30.166
What's wrong, Mom?

56:30.416 --> 56:31.958
- Nothing.
- Are you crying?

56:32.250 --> 56:33.500
No, no.

56:34.083 --> 56:36.875
- What's wrong?
- Don't listen to him.

56:49.083 --> 56:52.833
Come on, Wilson, they need to look
presentable if we want to sell them.

56:53.083 --> 56:55.583
They weren't presentable
at the museum?

56:57.958 --> 57:00.333
We need to fence them now.

57:01.750 --> 57:03.458
Are you scared?

57:04.166 --> 57:08.333
- Should we give them back?
- No, otherwise it's all wasted.

57:10.708 --> 57:13.708
What if we go back
to the museum...

57:14.291 --> 57:17.791
...and leave them at the coat check?
No one would notice.

57:18.041 --> 57:20.041
What are we, clowns?

57:22.041 --> 57:25.333
We'll take them to Bosco,
in Palenque, like we agreed...

57:25.583 --> 57:29.583
...and he'll take us
to his client, that's it.

57:30.416 --> 57:31.791
- That's it?
- Yes.

57:34.500 --> 57:38.750
Juan thought about all the small gods
we had hidden in his closet.

57:40.208 --> 57:42.166
Where are they now?

57:43.458 --> 57:46.125
Do they still listen
to people's prayers?

57:46.750 --> 57:50.375
Or did they leave them to their fate,
like they did to us?

57:51.291 --> 57:55.500
Who were those men
who crafted those gods?

57:56.250 --> 57:58.666
What was their life like?

58:00.000 --> 58:03.083
And what would they think
about the way I live?

58:14.083 --> 58:16.583
Juan! Wake up.

58:17.125 --> 58:18.583
What?

58:33.125 --> 58:35.125
Turn off the engine.

58:36.666 --> 58:37.875
Where are you headed?

58:38.083 --> 58:39.583
- Nowhere.
- Palenque.

58:40.750 --> 58:42.333
Do you have ID?

58:42.833 --> 58:44.541
Show it to me.

58:57.625 --> 58:59.875
- Are you carrying marijuana?
- No.

59:00.250 --> 59:04.125
- I wasn't talking to you, whitey.
- No.

59:04.500 --> 59:06.958
Get out, we're searching the car.

59:16.541 --> 59:18.291
Go stand over there.

59:20.541 --> 59:22.125
Check everywhere.

59:28.791 --> 59:30.875
What's in that bag?

59:38.041 --> 59:39.791
Sergeant.

59:58.416 --> 01:00:00.625
Do you collect handcrafts?

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.750
Yes.

01:00:04.666 --> 01:00:06.500
You look familiar.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.333
You're a famous actor,
aren't you?

01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:12.750
Of course you are!

01:00:13.791 --> 01:00:16.458
Can I get an autograph
for my girlfriend?

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.541
Sure.

01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:36.625
[speaking Mayan]

01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:36.750
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:39.458
Sit down, go on.

01:01:43.916 --> 01:01:46.541
- Good morning.
- How are you?

01:01:47.083 --> 01:01:48.958
Hi, I'm Juan.

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:51.958
- Benjamin, from Satelite.
- Nice to meet you.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:55.416
Do you know a guide here
named Bosco Huerta?

01:01:56.791 --> 01:01:58.458
- No?
- How about "Chunuc"?

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:00.958
Ah! Yes, we know him.

01:02:01.541 --> 01:02:05.458
- He was there earlier with a group.
- Who the hell is Chunuc?

01:02:06.708 --> 01:02:09.833
When Pakal died at the age of 80...

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:12.416
...his sons, led by the priest...

01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:15.375
...descended these stairways
inside the building...

01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:18.291
...with torches, bearing his corpse.

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:23.791
Symbolically traveling down
the nine levels of the underworld.

01:02:24.416 --> 01:02:29.333
In 1952, when the master Alberto Ruz...

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:33.250
...the Mexican archaeologist,
found the tomb, they--

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.541
I'm sorry.

01:02:44.416 --> 01:02:46.458
Excuse me, mister, but...

01:02:46.791 --> 01:02:49.916
...you know, this group is complete
and already paid for.

01:02:51.791 --> 01:02:54.125
- Do you mind?
- We don't mind.

01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:56.833
- They don't mind.
- OK.

01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:58.875
Thank you. So...

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.125
...all the body of Pakal was spread
with cinnabar red.

01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:05.833
- Because of the sunrise. Because--
- It was the color--

01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:09.208
- The sun comes out, it's red.
- The color of the sunrise.

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:12.666
- In the east.
- Yes, that's it, the sunrise.

01:03:13.125 --> 01:03:16.708
So, we have an expert here, right?

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:19.041
Thank you, mister.

01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:24.083
The first archaeologists
tried to figure out...

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.458
...how this tomb was
get inside this pyramid.

01:03:28.916 --> 01:03:32.791
Until they realized
that was first the tomb...

01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:37.750
...and they build the pyramid
over the tomb, the sarcophagus.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.208
OK, so...

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.583
...ladies and gentlemen,
here we are...

01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:49.875
...in the tomb of Pakal.

01:03:52.583 --> 01:03:56.916
Pakal's body was
with different kind of jewels...

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:01.250
...each one with a different meaning,
and to crown it all...

01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:04.625
...a beautiful jade mask
covering his face...

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.625
...immortalizing his features forever.

01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:11.125
- From the museum in Mexico City.
- Yes, that's right.

01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:15.041
This is the same mask that was stolen
from the Anthropology Museum...

01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:18.041
...last week by cowards.

01:04:18.416 --> 01:04:21.500
Isn't the sarcophagus
supposed to be a spaceship?

01:04:21.875 --> 01:04:23.708
Yes... Yes, yes.

01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:27.083
- There is an interpretation.
- Yeah, you heard about that myth, right?

01:04:27.916 --> 01:04:32.916
There are some people telling that Pakal
was supposed to be steering a spaceship...

01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:35.291
...instead of laying in the Tree of Life.

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:38.625
But, you know, only small
and stupid children believe that.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.458
But we don't know.

01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:44.083
Yeah, they say that
he is laying back in the rocket...

01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:49.416
...like the NASA astronaut,
and all this full of levers and buttons.

01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:54.083
And now he's all set to go
and kill some space invaders. Right?

01:04:54.666 --> 01:04:57.541
Or like a cosmonaut.
We don't know.

01:04:58.083 --> 01:05:00.750
We can talk at the end of the tour
if you want.

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:02.416
OK, so let's continue, please.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:06.708
Let's go to our next stop,
el conjunto Las Cruces.

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:10.375
Thank you. Watch your step.
Let's go to get some fresh air.

01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:13.375
Wait, Chunuc!
I'm talking to you.

01:05:13.625 --> 01:05:16.333
- Wait.
- We need to talk.

01:05:17.041 --> 01:05:19.583
Unless you want to be
credited as the mastermind.

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:21.416
The what?

01:05:21.833 --> 01:05:23.791
Me? The mastermind?

01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:26.333
I have nothing to do
with this.

01:05:27.458 --> 01:05:29.333
- You gave us the idea!
- Stop saying that.

01:05:29.666 --> 01:05:31.291
- You gave us the idea!
- Stop saying that.

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:34.708
- You gave us the idea!
- Stop saying that!

01:05:34.958 --> 01:05:37.083
- For fuck's sake!
- Easy, Bosco.

01:05:37.416 --> 01:05:41.416
- Juan has it all under control.
- Fucking psycho, you too.

01:05:41.833 --> 01:05:46.416
You said: "Do something else,
don't be like our parents."

01:05:47.458 --> 01:05:52.208
- But this isn't what I meant!
- It's normal to be scared.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:58.083
- My hands are so delicate!
- They need to be moist, soaking wet.

01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:02.791
Is that Scherezada Rios?

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:06.750
- That's a great movie.
- Juanito, I'm not helping you.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.541
- I'm not joking.
- Chill, Bosco.

01:06:11.416 --> 01:06:13.125
Sit down, sit.

01:06:13.458 --> 01:06:16.041
You still haven't contacted
Mr. Gray, I assume.

01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:19.041
- Graves.
- Well, look.

01:06:19.291 --> 01:06:22.458
"Being a warrior is not
just about wishing it.

01:06:22.833 --> 01:06:25.458
It is an endless,
lifelong struggle."

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:27.291
Yes, yes.

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:31.083
"No one is born a warrior,
no one is born a commoner.

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:35.416
It is we who become
one thing or the other."

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:37.500
Carlos Castaneda.

01:06:39.916 --> 01:06:42.541
You can't use the master
to manipulate me.

01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:45.333
That's a low blow,
even from you.

01:06:46.416 --> 01:06:49.291
If you don't help us,
we'll go to Pepe Soto.

01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:51.041
He'll fence them.

01:06:51.416 --> 01:06:54.458
Go ahead, go to him.
You'll end up in jail...

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:57.375
- ...right next to him.
- So will you.

01:06:57.791 --> 01:06:59.416
Me? In jail?

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:02.666
Pepe Soto
is the King Midas of shit.

01:07:02.916 --> 01:07:04.625
Everything he touches
turns to shit.

01:07:04.875 --> 01:07:06.416
Exactly.

01:07:06.708 --> 01:07:10.416
That's why we're here,
and not with him.

01:07:11.416 --> 01:07:14.791
- Get us in touch with Mr. Gray.
- Graves.

01:07:15.166 --> 01:07:17.916
That's right, Graves.
We'll do the rest.

01:07:18.166 --> 01:07:22.416
Even if I got ahold of him,
which I'm not doing...

01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:26.083
...how will you talk him into
moving such hot pieces?

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.875
Hold this.

01:07:58.666 --> 01:08:00.708
It's fucking beautiful.

01:08:01.916 --> 01:08:04.291
- I know.
- Beautiful.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.041
Are you going to help us?

01:08:17.916 --> 01:08:19.249
What?

01:08:20.624 --> 01:08:22.166
Nothing, man.

01:08:41.707 --> 01:08:46.749
"Death is our eternal companion"

01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:50.249
"Always to our left"

01:08:50.582 --> 01:08:55.624
"An arm's distance away"

01:08:59.874 --> 01:09:01.291
Fuck.

01:09:02.416 --> 01:09:03.957
Holy shit.

01:09:07.624 --> 01:09:10.916
So, what are you doing
with your share?

01:09:15.874 --> 01:09:18.332
Those were the best days.

01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:25.332
Sometimes, I even forgot
we had robbed the museum.

01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:39.207
I liked to imagine that
blah, blah, blah.

01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:43.874
"You felt its icy touch"

01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:50.457
"The way you felt it today"

01:09:51.874 --> 01:09:55.458
50 MILLION REWARD FOR HELP
RETRIEVING STOLEN ARTIFACTS

01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:59.958
By then, the INTERPOL
was already on the case.

01:10:00.875 --> 01:10:04.750
They were looking for
the Museum thieves.

01:10:21.375 --> 01:10:24.791
Juan always quoted something
Hernan Cortes once said:

01:10:25.416 --> 01:10:29.416
"I came here looking for gold,
not to plow the earth like a peasant."

01:10:31.291 --> 01:10:36.000
He said he was finally
no longer afraid to die.

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:40.458
"Death is our eternal
companion...

01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:46.208
Always behind us, to the left,
an arm's distance away.

01:10:48.416 --> 01:10:52.625
Death is the only wise advisor
a warrior can count on.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:58.458
When the warrior feels
he's about to be killed...

01:10:59.333 --> 01:11:01.958
...he can turn to his death...

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.041
...and ask if it's true.

01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:08.000
His death will tell him
he's wrong.

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.458
That nothing matters,
except for its touch.

01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:16.708
His death will say:
'I haven't touched you yet'."

01:12:23.125 --> 01:12:25.666
The Mayas who worked
near the pyramids told us...

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.916
...they often break in at night
to leave offerings for their dead.

01:12:32.458 --> 01:12:38.000
Site employees always clear them
to keep it neat for the tourists.

01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:44.333
I don't know for whom Juan's
offering was supposed to be.

01:12:44.833 --> 01:12:47.708
I don't know if it was an offering,
or a way of apologizing...

01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:49.625
...or some sort of reparation.

01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:51.416
He never told me.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.875
Juan.

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.750
Juan.

01:12:57.083 --> 01:12:58.333
Juan.

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:00.458
It's done.

01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:05.791
- Who?
- What do you mean "who"?

01:13:06.166 --> 01:13:08.291
Frank Graves called back.

01:13:08.541 --> 01:13:12.541
He wants to meet on Friday,
in Acapulco, we need to go.

01:13:28.375 --> 01:13:33.291
Security was doubled at airports,
naval ports, and train stations...

01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:35.500
...to keep the jewels
from being smuggled.

01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:40.875
The Customs Office incorrectly
described the pieces to the outposts...

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:46.291
...claiming they were clay and stone,
when in fact they're gold and jade.

01:13:47.375 --> 01:13:51.125
So, I'm the Mexican contact
for Mr...

01:13:51.375 --> 01:13:53.583
- Mr. Quest.
- West.

01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:56.583
- Yeah, Quest.
- Not Quest, West. All right?

01:13:56.833 --> 01:14:01.333
Our boss, Mr. West has
businesses in the Caribbean.

01:14:01.625 --> 01:14:04.791
- Let's not say that.
- No?

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:07.166
- Don't say a word.
- OK.

01:14:07.416 --> 01:14:09.541
I'll do all the talking,
and when I signal...

01:14:09.958 --> 01:14:14.041
...you take out the bait.
He needs to savor it.

01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:16.541
- Those fuckers are like that.
- How?

01:14:16.791 --> 01:14:19.083
Like that, like pedophiles.

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:25.541
And then can we go see
the cliff divers?

01:14:28.791 --> 01:14:31.916
- Aren't you dressing up?
- I did.

01:14:33.083 --> 01:14:37.333
What? No one told me we
had to dress like waiters.

01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:16.916
I have to go home,
my dad is in the hospital.

01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:20.791
Damn, Wilson.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.083
That sucks.

01:15:23.916 --> 01:15:26.083
Let's finish this
and get back tomorrow.

01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:28.458
My dad is in the hospital,
I'm leaving.

01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:34.583
Tomorrow, you'll be able to afford
any hospital for your dad.

01:15:34.916 --> 01:15:37.541
Like Houston!
We'll get him there.

01:15:37.875 --> 01:15:41.375
Think about it,
I'm only asking for one day.

01:15:42.666 --> 01:15:45.875
- I can't, Juan.
- Don't do this to me, Wilson.

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:49.541
You can't abandon me,
you're my eagle commander!

01:15:50.208 --> 01:15:52.083
- Damn it.
- I can't.

01:15:52.416 --> 01:15:53.833
Listen, you shit!

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:57.250
If you abandon me,
I'll never forgive you!

01:15:57.541 --> 01:15:58.791
Never!

01:16:01.333 --> 01:16:03.541
Goddammit, you bastard!

01:16:06.416 --> 01:16:08.458
Get in the fucking car!

01:16:42.875 --> 01:16:45.666
Wilson! Hey!
Come here.

01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:48.500
- What's that?
- Home.

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:52.291
- Right?
- Of course not.

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:54.833
It's Satelite, I'm telling you!

01:17:22.958 --> 01:17:24.916
I love Acapulco.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.208
Gentlemen, good afternoon.

01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:31.583
My apologies, I had guests.
Bosco, how are you, old boy?

01:17:31.666 --> 01:17:34.958
These are Omar Robles
and Francisco Muñoz.

01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:41.083
- Hi. Hello, Mr. Graves.
- Frank, please.

01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:44.791
Nobody calls me Mr. Graves
except those fuckers from Hacienda.

01:17:45.166 --> 01:17:48.916
How exciting!
Shall we get down to it? Follow me.

01:17:49.625 --> 01:17:50.500
Thank you, Frank.

01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:53.958
- Hey, Bosco! Come here.
- What, man?

01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:55.500
- An Englishman?
- What?

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:58.125
We're giving the country's jewels
to a fucking Englishman?

01:17:58.333 --> 01:18:00.333
They'll end up in
the fucking British Museum.

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:03.166
These fuckers don't care,
they don't even speak Spanish!

01:18:03.416 --> 01:18:04.708
- Follow me.
- Dude!

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.291
- What are you drinking, gentlemen?
- Whatever you have, Frank.

01:18:18.666 --> 01:18:20.625
You know? Una cuba for me is good.

01:18:20.708 --> 01:18:23.541
- I'd like a rum and coke, too.
- Make it three!

01:18:23.958 --> 01:18:27.875
Cubas, for fuck's sake!
This is not the Baby'O, boys.

01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:31.291
Gin and tonics all around, I think.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:37.291
Hey, Frankie, is this a new piece
from Tikal? 400 a.C., maybe?

01:18:38.625 --> 01:18:43.250
Classical period, yes. Very good.
You know your Maya, arqueólogo.

01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:46.958
Well, what I know was that Tikal
was sacked by the gringos and you Brits...

01:18:47.416 --> 01:18:49.041
...when they went in to restore it.

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:52.666
Well, after the Krauts had already taken
every Pre-Hispanic piece off site.

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:54.833
It's not "Pre-Hispanic."

01:18:56.458 --> 01:18:57.583
What should I say?

01:18:57.666 --> 01:19:01.500
Mesoamerican or Maya,
which is what they are.

01:19:03.208 --> 01:19:07.125
Cheers, gentlemen.
To Mesoamerica.

01:19:08.916 --> 01:19:12.500
Well, you know, every piece from Tikal
that are worth anything...

01:19:12.875 --> 01:19:14.333
...are now in private collections...

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:17.166
...where nobody can see them
but the friends of the owners.

01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:20.208
Still doing your Indiana Jones bit,
Bosquito?

01:19:20.291 --> 01:19:21.833
"This stuff belongs in a museum."

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:27.125
And are you still doing
your Belzoni bit, Frankie?

01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:29.125
You love it, right?

01:19:29.333 --> 01:19:32.041
Ever heard of Belzoni?
Giovanni Belzoni?

01:19:32.333 --> 01:19:36.250
He was an eccentric Italian,
a 19th century explorer.

01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:42.666
In his London strongman shows
he'd lift 20 people at once.

01:19:43.166 --> 01:19:45.833
Absolute lunatic, but he was responsible
for finding...

01:19:45.916 --> 01:19:48.166
...some of the most important sites
in Ancient Egypt.

01:19:48.958 --> 01:19:51.833
The Abu Simbel temple, Seti I's tomb,
to name but a few.

01:19:52.166 --> 01:19:54.708
Yes, and he kept half of what he found.

01:19:55.041 --> 01:20:00.083
And whatever he didn't stole for himself,
he selled it like it was his own.

01:20:00.625 --> 01:20:04.875
And that's how the Met, the Louvre
and your British Museum were made.

01:20:05.375 --> 01:20:09.250
That's how all museums were made,
even your Anthropology Museum.

01:20:09.833 --> 01:20:12.166
Where do you think they got
that Tlaloc monolith from?

01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:14.291
Do you think someone donated it
out of the kindness of their heart?

01:20:14.666 --> 01:20:18.750
Well, Frank, that rock is not Tlaloc,
this is actually Chalchiuhtlicue.

01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:20.666
They stole it.

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:23.250
Yes, Frank, I was there.

01:20:24.375 --> 01:20:27.833
That's my point. Without people like
Belzoni there wouldn't be any archaeology.

01:20:28.916 --> 01:20:30.541
There wouldn't be anything.

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:33.041
"There's no preservation
without plunder."

01:20:33.375 --> 01:20:35.833
You of all people should know that,
arqueólogo.

01:20:36.291 --> 01:20:39.125
Yeah, that's what
every thief in history says.

01:20:40.041 --> 01:20:41.291
Yes, maybe.

01:20:42.875 --> 01:20:44.541
Let me show you something.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:54.791
Page 20 or something.

01:20:55.125 --> 01:20:59.875
Last year, an American expedition
discovered a Spanish galleon...

01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:02.250
...in international waters.

01:21:02.333 --> 01:21:07.250
She'd been sunk by the British in 1804,
a beautiful, beautiful vessel.

01:21:08.791 --> 01:21:13.583
And inside this ship, they found gold,
valued at an estimated...

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:19.291
...$500 million,
that's half a billion greens.

01:21:20.541 --> 01:21:23.541
So, saying that it was
part of their national heritage...

01:21:23.625 --> 01:21:25.166
...or whatever the fuck they called it...

01:21:25.666 --> 01:21:28.250
...the Spanish government
claimed the vessel as their property...

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:30.750
...and sued the Americans.

01:21:30.958 --> 01:21:33.458
Well, the Yanks, quite naturally, said...

01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:35.458
"What the fuck are you talking about?
We found this shit."

01:21:35.833 --> 01:21:38.916
And then the government of Peru
stuck their noses in.

01:21:39.166 --> 01:21:43.458
Wasn't the gold which was being carried by
the Spanish galleon originally Inca gold?

01:21:43.791 --> 01:21:46.833
In which case,
shouldn't it go back to Peru...

01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:52.041
...from where those conquistador bastards
stole it in the first place?

01:21:52.416 --> 01:21:53.833
Yes, I'd think that's obvious.

01:21:54.208 --> 01:21:58.250
Yes, but who had paid for the
very expensive underwater expedition...

01:21:58.333 --> 01:22:03.083
...without which there wouldn't be
any galleon, or any Inca gold...

01:22:03.166 --> 01:22:06.416
...or anything to argue about?

01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:10.583
It's not so simple, is it?

01:22:13.416 --> 01:22:16.666
Anyway, you didn't come here to hear me
rattle on about Spanish galleons.

01:22:17.208 --> 01:22:20.166
Bosco here says you have
something very special...

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:22.416
...and he's never disappointed me, so...

01:22:24.291 --> 01:22:25.458
Yes.

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:29.083
Thank you, Frank, for receiving us.

01:22:29.958 --> 01:22:34.333
Me and Alan,
we are very happy to be here...

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:39.708
...representing the interests of Mr. West.
Mr. West operates mainly in the Caribbean.

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:44.791
Mr. West cares deeply
about where his goods will end up...

01:22:45.083 --> 01:22:47.250
...so he will be more than happy...

01:22:47.333 --> 01:22:50.208
...if all the things that we come
to present end up in your hands.

01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:52.958
- Mr. West--
- Why?

01:22:57.083 --> 01:22:59.291
Why would he be happy?

01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:07.500
Because you... It's you.
You have a very good eye.

01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:12.458
And with all your collection
and what we brought...

01:23:13.125 --> 01:23:17.083
...you can have someone like architect
Ramírez Vázquez build you your own museum.

01:23:20.166 --> 01:23:23.125
Mr. West would like to...

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:27.666
Normally, you know,
he would scatter these pieces around...

01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:30.083
...with his clients in the Caribbean
to minimize the risk.

01:23:30.958 --> 01:23:34.416
But this time he's willing to
take the risk and offer the whole lot...

01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:39.125
...140 pieces, intact, to only one buyer.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.083
Especially one that appreciates
what he's getting.

01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:45.125
Alan?

01:25:07.416 --> 01:25:12.166
Frank, our boss, Mr. Quest
is involved in heists...

01:25:12.416 --> 01:25:14.750
...at the most prominent
museums in the world.

01:25:15.041 --> 01:25:18.500
Europe, Asia, Africa,
the United States.

01:25:19.083 --> 01:25:23.666
So don't be scared, Frank.
Mr. Quest is a professional.

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:26.916
How much?

01:25:28.375 --> 01:25:31.333
For the mask?
No, no, he wants to sell the whole lot.

01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:33.458
Okay, how much for the whole lot?

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.583
- Mr. West is asking for $1 million.
- West or Quest? I'm confused.

01:25:37.916 --> 01:25:39.666
West, West! West.

01:25:41.041 --> 01:25:45.416
Mr. West wants a million?
And how did he come up with that figure?

01:25:48.708 --> 01:25:50.583
You know, what I find
really fascinating is...

01:25:50.666 --> 01:25:54.125
...who would choose you two kids
to try and make this deal.

01:25:54.208 --> 01:25:55.625
What do you mean?

01:25:56.375 --> 01:25:59.666
You've got some fucking balls, my friends,
I'll give you that...

01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:01.166
...coming in here
trying to pull this stunt.

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:03.375
And you, you're gonna hear from me,
Bosquito.

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:06.416
Hey, Frank. No, no, listen to me.
I was just do the introduction.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:07.666
This is not my business.

01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:09.375
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

01:26:09.458 --> 01:26:10.583
Frank!

01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:14.500
If you think this mask is fake, then
you know nothing about Mesoamerican art.

01:26:14.583 --> 01:26:16.041
I know every art dealer there is.

01:26:16.125 --> 01:26:18.250
I know you don't have a boss called
Mr. West or Mr. Quest...

01:26:18.333 --> 01:26:19.458
...or whatever the fuck you call him.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.833
And I know you got that suit
in Suburbia just before coming here.

01:26:22.916 --> 01:26:24.250
You're no dealer, kid.

01:26:24.583 --> 01:26:27.833
These are the real pieces that were stolen
from the Museum of Anthropology.

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:30.541
- I know!
- Yes, test them, test them.

01:26:30.625 --> 01:26:33.291
I know that's the real mask of King Pakal,
there's nothing else like it in the world.

01:26:33.375 --> 01:26:36.125
But listen to me, you can't sell this.

01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:41.333
Nobody can. Nobody in this business
is stupid enough to buy it.

01:26:42.583 --> 01:26:43.875
You understand?

01:26:50.208 --> 01:26:53.416
- OK, let's sell it for half a million--
- No, look at me. Look at me!

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.750
These pieces are unsellable.

01:26:59.250 --> 01:27:01.375
They might as well be worthless.

01:27:08.041 --> 01:27:09.708
Oh, you're boys.

01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:15.250
You look like good boys, you're not
crooks. Now, if you'll excuse me...

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.208
...I need to get back to my guests.

01:27:19.583 --> 01:27:22.666
Frank, maybe you heard
this other story.

01:27:23.875 --> 01:27:27.250
Rockefeller's plane was so heavy
from all the Maya stelae...

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:30.916
...they had stolen from us,
that it couldn't take off!

01:27:31.541 --> 01:27:32.833
And what is that to me?

01:27:33.041 --> 01:27:35.416
The law is strict when it comes
to archaeology, right?

01:27:35.666 --> 01:27:37.416
Especially on foreigners.

01:27:37.708 --> 01:27:40.500
All my stuff is completely legal.

01:27:40.875 --> 01:27:43.041
People at the Instituto Nacional
have my back...

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:45.291
...people, by the way, who'd be
very happy to recover this treasure.

01:27:45.375 --> 01:27:47.125
They're fucking thieves,
like you.

01:27:47.208 --> 01:27:49.500
All it takes is one phone call.

01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:59.458
Look, if I were you, I'd...
I'd fly away tonight.

01:28:01.416 --> 01:28:03.291
They're gonna come after you.

01:28:05.458 --> 01:28:07.625
Just fly the fuck away.

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:17.125
Are we going back
to Mexico City?

01:28:17.541 --> 01:28:19.666
I need to check up
on my dad.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.625
Juan!

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.250
Juan!

01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:33.500
One of these.

01:28:37.375 --> 01:28:39.208
What did she say?

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:43.333
Hello?

01:29:04.875 --> 01:29:06.750
- Hello?
- Chiva.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
- Where are you, idiot?
- Chiva, I need your help.

01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:11.583
Dad's going to kill you.

01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:13.041
Is he angry?

01:29:13.125 --> 01:29:15.500
He reported the car as stolen.
Where are you, idiot?

01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:17.125
But it wasn't stolen!

01:29:17.208 --> 01:29:20.000
It's stolen, even if we know
who has the car.

01:29:20.083 --> 01:29:24.833
I need to know the name of
Pepe Soto's club in Acapulco.

01:29:25.125 --> 01:29:26.125
Why, you idiot?

01:29:26.208 --> 01:29:27.916
Stop calling me idiot,
you hag!

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.250
What's the name
of the club in Acapulco?

01:29:30.333 --> 01:29:32.375
What are you doing
in Acapulco, idiot?

01:29:32.458 --> 01:29:33.708
I'm not!

01:29:33.791 --> 01:29:34.916
What makes you think
I'm there?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.541
"What makes you think I'm there?"

01:29:37.208 --> 01:29:39.250
Dad is gonna castrate you
when he sees you.

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:41.500
Just give me the name!

01:29:43.666 --> 01:29:44.833
Heaven's Gates.

01:29:44.916 --> 01:29:46.875
Got it. Thanks, hag.

01:29:46.958 --> 01:29:49.875
You're the only one of the four
I like, don't tell anyone.

01:30:01.708 --> 01:30:05.041
Visiting hours at the hospital
start at eight o'clock.

01:30:10.208 --> 01:30:11.708
Juan?

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:15.666
Juan.

01:30:20.583 --> 01:30:24.041
How will we get there
if you don't know where it is?

01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:28.750
Remember the book
Journey to Ixtlan?

01:30:29.541 --> 01:30:31.125
The Castaneda one?

01:30:32.041 --> 01:30:35.708
Remember when Don Juan
shows them how to stop the world?

01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:43.375
Don't do that, Juan.

01:30:45.458 --> 01:30:46.666
Don't worry.

01:30:48.875 --> 01:30:51.750
Don't worry, It's all good.
Just be chill.

01:30:52.416 --> 01:30:54.375
- Juan!
- Just breathe.

01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:58.458
Go with the flow, man.
Just breathe.

01:31:00.958 --> 01:31:02.916
We'll be with Pepe soon.

01:31:03.333 --> 01:31:06.500
We'll get an advance for the pieces
and we'll go back home.

01:31:07.333 --> 01:31:08.583
Turn on the lights!

01:31:09.083 --> 01:31:11.750
Holy shit! Oh, fuck!
You fucking asshole!

01:31:12.041 --> 01:31:14.208
He hit us, asshole!
Turn them on!

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.541
Stop the car, asshole!

01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:19.416
- Turn on the lights!
- There, there.

01:31:19.791 --> 01:31:22.500
- Pull over now! Pull over!
- What for?

01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:24.000
Stop the car.

01:31:24.291 --> 01:31:27.750
Where are you going?
Where are you going, idiot?

01:31:29.125 --> 01:31:30.708
What are you doing?

01:31:31.375 --> 01:31:34.166
- Where are you going?
- Fuck you, to Mexico!

01:31:34.416 --> 01:31:37.125
- Get back here.
- Stop it!

01:31:37.708 --> 01:31:41.166
Don't start with this!
You'll end up crying.

01:31:42.666 --> 01:31:45.625
I'm done following you.
I'm done!

01:31:46.583 --> 01:31:48.958
Without me, you're just
a stupid dog groomer...

01:31:49.208 --> 01:31:51.666
...who wipes his dad's asshole!

01:32:03.083 --> 01:32:04.875
Listen, you piece of shit.

01:32:08.125 --> 01:32:13.000
I took the blame when you nearly
blinded Toño Juarez, remember?

01:32:13.291 --> 01:32:16.166
They would've put you
in a mental hospital!

01:32:17.833 --> 01:32:20.708
I'm your only friend!
Do you understand?

01:32:21.583 --> 01:32:23.333
Let go of me!

01:32:26.333 --> 01:32:27.958
Will you be calm?

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.041
Will you be calm?

01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:32.791
Let go of me, asshole!

01:32:46.375 --> 01:32:48.333
Fuck off, dead-weight!

01:32:48.625 --> 01:32:50.750
I'm better off without you!

01:32:57.750 --> 01:33:01.000
START THE ACTION
AT THE SEA!

01:33:22.375 --> 01:33:25.000
- We should've studied music.
- You think?

01:33:25.375 --> 01:33:28.833
We'd have a kick ass band,
and we'd leave this place.

01:33:29.125 --> 01:33:30.875
Floyd didn’t study music.

01:33:31.166 --> 01:33:33.791
Floyd's not one person,
it's four.

01:33:34.083 --> 01:33:38.500
- I mean, you don't need to study.
- Or say dumb shit every time.

01:33:38.916 --> 01:33:41.500
To leave this place, I mean.

01:33:42.541 --> 01:33:44.541
- Bowie.
- He did study.

01:33:44.791 --> 01:33:47.083
That guy did study music.

01:33:48.875 --> 01:33:51.416
Haven't we gone through
this place before?

01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:53.750
- Obviously.
- Where are we going?

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.916
We're just driving around.
You got somewhere to be?

01:33:57.458 --> 01:34:00.375
- That's the point of driving around.
- Passing the same place over and over?

01:34:00.666 --> 01:34:03.333
- That's Satelite-folk's problem.
- That they go in circles?

01:34:03.583 --> 01:34:05.333
That they can't enjoy life.

01:34:05.625 --> 01:34:08.000
- And you?
- Me? I try to.

01:34:08.291 --> 01:34:10.625
- I mean are you Satelite-folk?
- No.

01:34:10.875 --> 01:34:15.708
- What are they like, then?
- They're so tired from work...

01:34:16.041 --> 01:34:18.708
...they'd rather watch TV
than be with their family.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.916
What's on TV tires them,
so they go to bed more tired.

01:34:23.208 --> 01:34:27.916
Their dreams tire them, too.
They look like crap, so tired.

01:34:28.916 --> 01:34:32.625
And one day, just like that,
they die from exhaustion.

01:34:32.916 --> 01:34:34.541
What if you stop
turning the wheel?

01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:37.208
- We stop going in circles.
- We go in a straight line.

01:34:37.458 --> 01:34:40.291
- We crash into the light post.
- And we die.

01:34:41.458 --> 01:34:45.666
Then we wake up and realize
we're still driving in circles.

01:34:52.708 --> 01:34:56.291
Or... we could do
something different.

01:34:57.125 --> 01:34:58.750
Like what?

01:34:59.791 --> 01:35:01.750
Like nicking something.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.541
Nicking something?
You mean stealing?

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:08.583
- Why not?
- Why yes?

01:35:10.541 --> 01:35:14.833
Because I'm sick of waiting for
something to happen, aren't you?

01:35:15.416 --> 01:35:18.166
Would stealing make
something happen?

01:35:19.541 --> 01:35:21.375
Do you have a better idea?

01:35:23.083 --> 01:35:24.916
That's what I thought.

01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:28.708
So, what would we nick?
This car?

01:35:28.958 --> 01:35:32.458
No way! This car belongs
to my family.

01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:36.125
- So, what then?
- We'll figure it out later.

01:35:45.666 --> 01:35:47.291
Excuse me!

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.625
Good evening!

01:35:50.083 --> 01:35:52.708
Do you know a place called
Heaven's Gates?

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:58.166
- Excuse me?
- Heaven's Gates?

01:35:59.416 --> 01:36:02.750
Heaven's gates
are closed to you.

01:36:06.333 --> 01:36:07.875
Just kidding!

01:36:08.125 --> 01:36:10.708
Heaven's Gates
is that way!

01:36:11.875 --> 01:36:14.000
- Thank you!
- You got it.

01:37:56.291 --> 01:38:00.041
HEAVEN'S GATES

01:38:22.541 --> 01:38:24.500
That's Scherezada, right?

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.583
- From the movies?
- What else can I get you?

01:38:27.833 --> 01:38:30.291
It's her, right?
It has to be.

01:38:32.791 --> 01:38:35.083
Hey, man. Come here.

01:38:38.208 --> 01:38:42.375
Tell Pepe Soto that Lazy Juan
is here for him.

01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:47.125
I don't know him.

01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:49.708
Pepe Soto.

01:38:49.958 --> 01:38:52.708
That guy right there.
Your boss.

01:38:53.708 --> 01:38:57.791
That guy hasn't been
around here in a while.

01:39:02.166 --> 01:39:05.583
- Anything else?
- Can I have my money back?

01:39:24.333 --> 01:39:27.000
Yeah, shake it, come here.

01:39:30.708 --> 01:39:33.166
Come jingle those coins
in my face!

01:39:40.833 --> 01:39:44.833
Where are you going?
Come dance with me!

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
- Leave her alone!
- Old hag!

01:39:49.291 --> 01:39:53.250
- Respect the artist!
- Go look after your grandkids, bitch!

01:39:57.541 --> 01:40:01.125
Why are you dancing here
if you're gonna be a bitch about it?

01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:07.541
- Is this how you treat your sisters?
- Mind your fucking business.

01:40:07.833 --> 01:40:10.375
- Apologize to her.
- Fuck you.

01:40:10.916 --> 01:40:13.250
And now, a fight.

01:41:03.083 --> 01:41:04.791
Enough, assholes.

01:41:06.708 --> 01:41:09.583
Here is your fucking
white knight, Eugenia.

01:41:11.333 --> 01:41:14.583
Take him out the back,
or they'll kill him.

01:41:18.708 --> 01:41:20.166
Wait, my bag.

01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:22.541
My bag, my bag!

01:41:23.458 --> 01:41:27.166
- Hey, where's my bag?
- It's here, kid.

01:41:29.625 --> 01:41:33.083
Listen, you can't come here
and get into a fight...

01:41:33.458 --> 01:41:36.000
...and think that nothing
will happen to you.

01:41:36.708 --> 01:41:40.458
It's not a soap opera set,
this is the state of Guerrero.

01:41:41.708 --> 01:41:44.000
They disrespected you,
Scherezada.

01:41:44.375 --> 01:41:47.250
That's so nice.
What a moron!

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:51.833
Why do you play the hero?
You're too small for that.

01:41:52.833 --> 01:41:57.166
- Why aren't you at a club?
- Scherezada Rios is not there.

01:41:57.458 --> 01:42:01.125
Don't call me that.
My name is Eugenia.

01:42:01.375 --> 01:42:04.166
- Eugenia?
- Yeah.

01:42:04.458 --> 01:42:05.958
I had no idea.

01:42:06.458 --> 01:42:09.500
Don't worry about it,
why would you know?

01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:13.666
I've seen The Hard Life of an
Easy Woman a million times.

01:42:13.875 --> 01:42:15.666
Another fan.

01:42:16.541 --> 01:42:18.666
Yeah, so what?

01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:23.708
- I hear you're looking for Pepe.
- Yes.

01:42:25.625 --> 01:42:27.583
Pepe died last year.

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:30.000
What?

01:42:31.541 --> 01:42:33.750
Yeah, he was killed.

01:42:39.125 --> 01:42:40.916
Fuck.

01:42:41.583 --> 01:42:43.958
It'll be six months now.

01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:47.916
He owed a lot of money.

01:42:49.333 --> 01:42:52.500
He was mixed up in things,
way above his head.

01:42:53.791 --> 01:42:56.791
- What did you want with him?
- Help.

01:42:57.666 --> 01:42:58.916
From Pepe?

01:42:59.166 --> 01:43:02.791
You must be in deep shit
if you need help from Pepe.

01:43:07.166 --> 01:43:09.375
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.

01:43:14.125 --> 01:43:16.375
50 MILLION REWARD FOR HELP
RETRIEVING STOLEN ARTIFACTS

01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:31.750
Do you sell handcrafts?

01:43:35.416 --> 01:43:37.208
They're not handcrafts.

01:43:43.708 --> 01:43:46.708
The stuff inside that bag
is worth millions of dollars...

01:43:47.958 --> 01:43:50.166
...and nothing at all.

01:44:22.125 --> 01:44:23.875
When he was alive...

01:44:25.083 --> 01:44:27.208
...this place was the best.

01:44:27.875 --> 01:44:32.833
It was the best one.
People fought to get in.

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.500
Say that again.

01:44:38.250 --> 01:44:41.208
People fought to get in.

01:44:41.458 --> 01:44:42.583
What?

01:44:43.041 --> 01:44:45.333
I said people fought to get in.

01:44:46.291 --> 01:44:48.041
People fought to get in.

01:44:48.833 --> 01:44:49.958
What?

01:44:55.833 --> 01:44:56.833
My love!

01:44:59.166 --> 01:45:01.958
Wait, I have an idea!
Know what a zarahuato is?

01:45:02.208 --> 01:45:04.666
- No.
- A monkey that goes like this.

01:45:08.250 --> 01:45:10.041
That's right,
now a bit of this.

01:45:10.416 --> 01:45:11.583
There we go.

01:45:14.625 --> 01:45:17.833
Wait, wait! Like a monkey!

01:45:22.666 --> 01:45:25.250
Yes, Scherezada.

01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:27.708
Schere...

01:45:28.208 --> 01:45:31.041
Honestly, I've dreamt of you
after every one of your movies.

01:45:31.583 --> 01:45:38.541
I have dedicated so many
nighttime thoughts to you.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.833
No, I won't tell you what I did.
What's the point?

01:45:47.458 --> 01:45:50.625
Yeah, that's right.
Dance for me.

01:46:57.125 --> 01:47:01.541
Good morning!
Have you seen a red bag?

01:47:02.791 --> 01:47:05.750
Are you sure?
A red bag around here?

01:47:22.416 --> 01:47:25.166
I'm a fucking idiot!

01:47:39.208 --> 01:47:41.666
I'm so stupid!

01:47:42.125 --> 01:47:44.166
What a fucking idiot!

01:48:09.166 --> 01:48:15.000
I get dizzy thinking about how close
those pieces came to being lost forever.

01:48:15.416 --> 01:48:20.875
I think of all the things that might've
disappeared without anyone knowing.

01:48:21.291 --> 01:48:24.041
All the things that
could have never been.

01:48:24.291 --> 01:48:27.291
And yet, there they are.

01:48:29.333 --> 01:48:32.791
One time, we crashed the car
and Juan's dad confessed...

01:48:33.041 --> 01:48:36.625
...how close they came
to having him aborted.

01:48:37.041 --> 01:48:40.000
Juan always said he wished
they had done it.

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.958
What do you think
they're arguing about?

01:49:08.125 --> 01:49:10.041
Who jumps last.

01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:13.041
He gets the best tips.

01:49:21.166 --> 01:49:23.500
We have to hide, Wilson.

01:49:27.166 --> 01:49:29.125
We can't stay here.

01:49:34.875 --> 01:49:36.958
Are you listening to me?

01:49:42.333 --> 01:49:44.375
My father died.

01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:49.333
- No!
- And I wasn't there for him.

01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:02.333
Benjamin...

01:50:04.541 --> 01:50:06.583
...I'm so sorry.

01:50:09.083 --> 01:50:11.291
I'm truly sorry.

01:50:18.291 --> 01:50:20.500
And Pepe Soto?

01:50:21.708 --> 01:50:23.791
I couldn't find him.

01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:30.583
Where would we go?

01:50:33.708 --> 01:50:36.333
We'd disappear for a while.

01:50:39.125 --> 01:50:41.000
And the pieces?

01:50:41.791 --> 01:50:44.750
They'll disappear
along with us.

01:52:11.333 --> 01:52:12.666
Dad.

01:52:15.833 --> 01:52:17.166
Mom.

01:52:19.250 --> 01:52:20.583
Dad?

01:52:24.125 --> 01:52:25.875
I'm leaving.

01:52:30.083 --> 01:52:33.125
- Where were you?
- What are you doing, son?

01:52:34.541 --> 01:52:36.916
Where have you been?
Are you OK?

01:52:39.875 --> 01:52:41.916
I'm leaving, Mom.

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:46.083
- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- They're looking for you.

01:52:46.958 --> 01:52:49.666
The police were here
a few times.

01:52:50.416 --> 01:52:54.041
- Where were you?
- What did you do, huh?

01:53:00.791 --> 01:53:02.875
What did you do?

01:53:18.250 --> 01:53:22.458
- I fucked up.
- What did you do, Juan?

01:53:22.708 --> 01:53:26.250
What have you done, honey?
What have you done?

01:53:27.208 --> 01:53:31.458
The officer said you're a suspect
in the museum robbery.

01:53:33.708 --> 01:53:37.416
I told him he was wrong.

01:53:39.541 --> 01:53:42.666
That you gave us
a hard time...

01:53:42.958 --> 01:53:45.458
...that we struggled with you...

01:53:45.875 --> 01:53:48.416
...but that you were
no thief.

01:53:51.333 --> 01:53:53.000
You lied, Dad.

01:53:55.416 --> 01:53:57.041
I am.

01:53:58.916 --> 01:54:00.500
It was me.

01:54:02.375 --> 01:54:03.625
I did it.

01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:06.000
Stupid son of a bitch.

01:54:07.458 --> 01:54:09.541
Stupid son of a bitch!

01:54:09.875 --> 01:54:11.708
Dumb son of a bitch!

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.208
You dumb moron!
Son of a bitch!

01:54:17.416 --> 01:54:19.375
Why did you do it?

01:54:23.958 --> 01:54:27.083
Why... did you do it?

01:54:27.541 --> 01:54:29.791
I'm just no good.

01:54:31.541 --> 01:54:33.416
It's not your fault.

01:54:34.875 --> 01:54:36.750
I'm leaving.

01:54:37.125 --> 01:54:41.291
- You won't have to see me again.
- Where will you go?

01:54:41.875 --> 01:54:44.833
They're looking for you
everywhere.

01:54:45.083 --> 01:54:47.000
I don't know.

01:54:49.875 --> 01:54:51.958
I'll disappear.

01:54:53.958 --> 01:54:56.541
I'll never bother you
again.

01:54:58.750 --> 01:55:00.625
What was it you wanted?

01:55:03.333 --> 01:55:04.750
Was it money?

01:55:07.833 --> 01:55:09.666
You have money.

01:55:09.958 --> 01:55:11.416
Always.

01:55:12.375 --> 01:55:15.375
You have never ever
wanted for anything.

01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:18.416
You've always had
everything.

01:55:20.583 --> 01:55:22.583
Why did you do it?

01:55:24.833 --> 01:55:26.375
Why?

01:55:29.375 --> 01:55:31.708
Did you want to impress us?

01:55:34.708 --> 01:55:37.125
We're impressed, Juan.

01:55:38.666 --> 01:55:41.375
We're truly impressed.

01:55:58.833 --> 01:56:00.666
Juan, no...

01:56:21.875 --> 01:56:23.125
Juan.

01:56:37.375 --> 01:56:39.125
We won't take long.

01:56:48.916 --> 01:56:50.250
Dad!

01:57:29.333 --> 01:57:30.958
What is it?

01:57:35.166 --> 01:57:37.250
- What are you doing, Juan?
- Leave the two bags.

01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.875
Wait for me outside.
I'll be right back.

01:57:40.166 --> 01:57:41.541
Juan!

01:57:53.666 --> 01:57:56.500
What you're seeing here...

01:57:56.750 --> 01:58:00.708
...is the empty display cases
of the relics of the Maya room.

01:58:01.958 --> 01:58:06.041
Authorities claim that a group
of professional traffickers...

01:58:06.291 --> 01:58:09.958
...of about twenty men
pulled off the heist.

01:58:11.208 --> 01:58:14.583
They are experts
in robbing art galleries...

01:58:14.833 --> 01:58:18.375
...of the highest caliber,
and connections in Africa...

01:58:18.666 --> 01:58:19.916
...Asia and Europe.

01:58:20.208 --> 01:58:22.541
When the museum reopened
after the robbery...

01:58:22.791 --> 01:58:25.125
...more people came
than ever before.

01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:31.625
Everyone wanted to see
the empty cases.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000
That fat intellectual guy,
the one with the cats...

01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:45.791
...said that was the robbers'
gift to Mexico:

01:58:46.208 --> 01:58:50.166
The reminder that no one knows
what they have until it's gone.

01:59:17.375 --> 01:59:19.041
No touching.

01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:28.291
Pakal was one of the most
important rulers of Palenque.

01:59:28.708 --> 01:59:31.333
THIS PIECE IS A REPLICA
OF THE ORIGINAL

01:59:31.875 --> 01:59:37.750
Hieroglyphic records tell us he rose
to the throne when he was twelve.

01:59:38.166 --> 01:59:42.500
And he died well into
his eighties.

01:59:43.291 --> 01:59:47.000
The mask and the whole
funeral attire are important...

01:59:47.291 --> 01:59:53.625
...because they weren't plundered,
the tomb wasn't opened until 1952.

01:59:53.875 --> 01:59:55.916
I said no touching!

01:59:56.458 --> 02:00:00.416
So, the funeral attire was found
exactly like the Mayas placed it...

02:00:00.708 --> 02:00:03.375
...when Pakal's body
was laid to rest.

02:00:06.541 --> 02:00:08.125
Attention. R-3.

02:00:08.375 --> 02:00:10.583
Attention.
Maya room. R-3.

02:00:10.833 --> 02:00:13.000
Suspect headed to the
central courtyard.

02:00:45.333 --> 02:00:47.208
Sometimes I wonder...

02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:52.250
...what would've happened
if Juan hadn't separated from me.

02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:58.041
Sometimes I wonder
why he did it.

02:00:59.958 --> 02:01:02.750
Why we did
everything we did.

02:01:04.916 --> 02:01:08.333
But then I remember
what Juan used to say...

02:01:09.583 --> 02:01:14.500
...about how only the person who did
something knows why they did it.

02:01:16.333 --> 02:01:19.083
And more often that not,
not even them.

02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:20.750
Freeze!

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.916
And if they do know...

02:01:23.250 --> 02:01:25.500
...they won't tell you anyway.

02:01:31.875 --> 02:01:36.000
Juan said if I ever told our story,
I shouldn't tell the truth.

02:01:36.875 --> 02:01:38.750
I asked him why.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.625
"The truth?" he said.

02:01:42.875 --> 02:01:46.250
"Why ruin a good story
with the truth?"
