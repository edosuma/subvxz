WEBVTT

04:43.199 --> 04:44.908
Joe, you're under arrest.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.786
Maybe so, but don't turn around, sheriff.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.372
Now what're you gonna do, sheriff?

04:59.048 --> 05:01.300
You can do just about what you want,
Chance.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.513
Anybody else you want besides Joe?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.350
No.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.728
Give me a hand.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.821
-What is all this?
-Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

06:04.989 --> 06:08.075
Tell your men to stay with the wagons
till they're told different.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.786
Who the devil do you think
you're ordering around here?

06:10.953 --> 06:14.289
First Burdette's men stop me and
now you stand there and try to--

06:15.458 --> 06:18.919
-Say, seems like I ought to know you.
-I think you do, Mr. Wheeler.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.380
Yeah, I remember you now.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.841
That star you're wearing
kind of threw me off for a minute.

06:25.009 --> 06:28.136
Aren't you the fellow
the Mexicans used to call borrachín?

06:28.846 --> 06:31.223
That's nearly right. Only it's borrachón.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.767
I don't think I've ever seen you
like this before.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.813
You mean sober? You're probably right.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.564
You know what "borrachón" means?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.608
My Spanish ain't too good.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.276
It means drunk.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.822
Now if the name bothers you,
they used to call me Dude.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.157
Now are you gonna tell your men or do I?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.035
I'll tell my men.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.793
Stand by the wagons, everybody!

07:00.336 --> 07:01.586
Pass the word.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.537
Chance, what's going on here?

07:35.705 --> 07:38.874
People stopping me. Everybody telling me
what I can and can't do.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.209
Next thing, you'll be telling me what to do.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.919
-Pat, I will tell you.
-What?

07:43.087 --> 07:45.547
-Stop your wagons.
-Oh, I give up.

07:49.635 --> 07:53.388
Now don't tell me what's going on.
Just leave me wandering around in the fog.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.433
I like it. I'm getting used to it.
It makes me feel so good.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.894
You better look out, Pat,
you'll blow up and bust.

07:59.061 --> 08:02.606
Oh, listen, Chance, remember me?
Your old friend Pat Wheeler.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.566
-Now, will you please--?
-Hey, Chance!

08:04.984 --> 08:08.445
What do you wanna do about this outfit?
Do you wanna take their guns?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.155
Got any new men with you, Pat?

08:10.323 --> 08:12.532
No, nobody except Colorado here.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.243
-Where'd you take him on?
-Fort Worth.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.746
-What does he do?
-I speak English, sheriff...

08:18.289 --> 08:20.081
...if you wanna ask me.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.921
All right, buster, what do you do?

08:26.589 --> 08:27.756
I'm riding guard.

08:28.299 --> 08:32.092
-Pretty young for that, aren't you?
-Just how old do you have to be, sheriff?

08:33.638 --> 08:35.679
You remember Ryan from Denver,
don't you?

08:35.847 --> 08:38.683
-Rocky Ryan?
-Well, that's his boy.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.269
He tells me the kid's faster than he was.

08:41.562 --> 08:44.606
Well, he better be,
packing a pair of guns.

08:44.941 --> 08:49.277
Now, sheriff, if it's the two guns that
bother you, I could give you one of them.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.404
I could let you have them both.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.615
They wouldn't do me too much good.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.618
That fellow in the door there
has a shotgun on me.

08:56.911 --> 09:00.580
-Stumpy, didn't I tell--?
-I know. I'm going. I'm going.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.086
You can keep your guns, Colorado.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.130
Thanks, sheriff. I don't want any trouble.

09:09.423 --> 09:10.966
Well, then don't start any.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.552
I won't, unless I tell you first.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.345
That's good enough.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.098
Pat, you can put your wagons
in that corral.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.849
I ought to do just that.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.602
-What?
-I'm just guessing, you understand.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.730
It seems to me that you've already
got some trouble here.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.148
You're guessing right.

09:27.316 --> 09:31.152
It so happens that part of our load
there is fuel oil and dynamite.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.655
Would you like to have that
sitting next to you?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.073
No, I wouldn't.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.492
They could put them over there
by the creek.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.494
Near the Burdette warehouse.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.706
If it's gonna blow
that's just as good a place as any.

09:42.873 --> 09:46.126
Show them the way, Dude.
You can go along, Colorado.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.420
Is that the way you want it, Mr. Wheeler?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.299
Go ahead.

10:07.356 --> 10:11.067
-Well?
-Let's get out of the middle of the street.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.699
Well, now that you're satisfied
and that the kid's got his guns...

10:18.451 --> 10:21.870
...would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.623
We've got Joe Burdette in here.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.419
-Joe Burdette in jail? Nathan's brother?
-That's right.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.880
What are you holding him for?

10:32.048 --> 10:35.258
They were about to bury the reason
when you were coming in.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.886
-Murder?
-No other word for it.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.889
No wonder this town's in such a mess.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.141
What does Nathan say about this?

10:43.309 --> 10:46.478
Nothing. He's not talking. Just doing.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.896
You saw part of it.

10:48.064 --> 10:53.276
He's got this town so bottled up
that I can't get Joe out or any help in.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.197
Those men over there watching us...

10:57.573 --> 10:58.907
...they're his.

10:59.408 --> 11:02.035
I can't make a move
without him knowing it.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.870
Who you got helping you?

11:05.039 --> 11:06.831
You met half of them.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.627
You mean that fellow with the badge
that stopped me, and who else?

11:11.212 --> 11:13.546
Stumpy. You know him.

11:13.964 --> 11:16.341
He's watching Joe and guarding the jail.

11:17.426 --> 11:21.012
A game-legged old man and a drunk.
That's all you got?

11:21.180 --> 11:22.806
That's what I got.

11:23.766 --> 11:28.770
If I ever saw a man holding the bull
by the tail, you're it.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.399
It's a good idea putting my wagons
where they're safe.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.860
Guess I better see they did it.
I'll see you later.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.292
Better get back up there
and watch the road.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.961
You don't look so good.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.713
I feel worse.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.881
Think I'll stop off and get a beer.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.466
I thought you would.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.302
Got some in here. Cold.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.388
Just as long as it's beer.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.313
Stumpy, didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight?

12:12.481 --> 12:16.609
There you go. I never can please you.
I was just covering you in case of trouble.

12:16.777 --> 12:21.030
I'd be in more trouble if you'd have gotten
picked off while standing at that door.

12:21.198 --> 12:22.282
You'd be in trouble?

12:22.450 --> 12:24.534
What about me
if somebody gunned me down?

12:24.702 --> 12:26.494
Don't you never think of me?

12:27.079 --> 12:29.456
Dude, I guess we better get used to it.

12:29.707 --> 12:32.500
Here's a fellow don't think of nobody
but himself.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.878
I told you why I want you back in there...

12:35.045 --> 12:38.590
...and you're gonna stay there with
that cage locked when I'm not around.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.258
-You hear me?
-I heard you.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.010
Those windows, did you fix them?

12:42.178 --> 12:44.387
Them shutters is nailed up
tighter than a drum.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.014
Nothing could get in here now.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.683
-Not even some fresh air.
-That's the way I want it.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.019
You can help to change my life.
Can't help it.

12:51.187 --> 12:55.565
Five, six days breathing the same air as
Burdette is apt to make a killer out of me.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.026
You can hear me back there,
can't you, Joe?

12:58.194 --> 13:01.446
I hear you all right, but I won't have
to listen to you for very long.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.865
Now, Joe, that's gratitude for you.

13:04.033 --> 13:07.035
After me fixing up all your cuts
and bruises like I done.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.662
I hope it happens again.
I won't do it, that's all.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.456
-Shut up!
-I take it back, Joe.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.584
If it does happen again,
I'll do just like I done before ...

13:14.752 --> 13:17.712
...only I hope you have
more cuts and bruises to fix.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.382
Hey, Dude. Dude, come here a minute.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.718
What do you want?

13:24.136 --> 13:26.721
Why don't you sit in here
in place of Stumpy?

13:27.389 --> 13:29.724
I'd rather listen to a drunk than him.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.936
How you holding up, borrachón?

13:33.521 --> 13:34.729
Got the shakes yet?

13:35.564 --> 13:39.776
That beer won't do you no good. You'll
have to get something stronger than that.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.904
If you're still broke,
I think I got another dollar.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.243
-Chance, you gonna let him do that to me?
-I'll do better than that.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.621
I'll let him have the key to your cell
anytime he wants it.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.920
It'd be too easy.
He's got nobody to back him up.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.841
If he talks out of turn,
throw a bucket of water on him.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.261
I'll throw one in the middle of his bed
and leave him sleep in it.

14:06.428 --> 14:10.431
Want another beer?
You kind of wasted some of that last one.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.101
No, it wasn't wasted,
except I missed him.

14:13.727 --> 14:16.563
-I don't need any more.
-Hey, in the jail.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.152
That's far enough. What do you want?

14:23.404 --> 14:26.447
Mr. Wheeler said to bring this package
to the sheriff.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.449
Hey, Chance, you expecting a package?

14:28.617 --> 14:30.076
Be right out.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.620
-Stumpy?
-Yeah?

14:32.788 --> 14:35.123
Going over to the hotel for a few minutes.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.543
If you don't come back,
me and Joe'll have us a good cry.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.628
Just keep that door locked.

14:42.339 --> 14:44.549
-Thanks for your trouble.
-No trouble at all.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.051
Wheeler said, "Just be careful coming up."

14:48.304 --> 14:50.346
Looks like our friend's still on the job.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.307
Yeah.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.310
There's another one over by the church.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.979
Any use in arresting them?

14:58.647 --> 15:00.523
For just standing around?

15:00.691 --> 15:02.817
All I'd do is get another one.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.320
The jail isn't big enough
to hold all of them.

15:05.487 --> 15:09.490
As a matter of fact,
they'd like to get a few in jail.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.159
Remember that.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.791
Señor Chance. I've been looking for you.
I have a message for--

15:18.959 --> 15:20.043
What you have here?

15:20.210 --> 15:22.128
The package you've been waiting for.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.463
Just in time, señor.

15:23.631 --> 15:27.634
-Carlos! Carlos! Where are you at?
-I'm over here.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.594
You keep it. Consuelo, she comes now.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.514
If you break the dishes, you'll see what
happens. Every day is the same thing....

15:33.682 --> 15:35.600
Carlos. Oh, Señor Chance .

15:35.809 --> 15:37.685
I just ask Carlos if he's...

15:37.853 --> 15:40.271
Carlos, what is wrong?

15:40.814 --> 15:43.483
You look like the cat
who swallows the chicken.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.109
What have you been doing?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.694
What have I been doing?

15:46.862 --> 15:50.365
I've been talking to my friend the sheriff,
that's what I have been doing.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.908
We have important business.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.243
You say I look like the cat
who eats too much.

15:54.411 --> 15:57.372
Consuelo, look at me . Am I fat?

15:57.539 --> 16:00.500
-I did not say you are fat.
-Please, Consuelo, do not say more.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.293
You already say too much.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.754
Me and my friend
will make our business alone.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.047
Come, señor.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.639
The thing is if he ate the chicken or not.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.391
I'm going to see.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.851
You take chances, my friend.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.311
Because I know woman.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.647
She will be mad or she will be sorry.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.358
If it is mad,
she will be much pleasure to make right.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.986
And if she is sorry,
it will be the same pleasure.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.029
You do not have women.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.614
So you do not know, señor.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.659
But me, Carlos Robante, I know.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.496
Wait till I show you
what is in this package.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.709
Then you tell me
if I do not know about women.

16:43.419 --> 16:47.755
If I had bought this myself, señor,
everyone in town would have known.

16:48.590 --> 16:53.344
And it's not the sort of thing that Consuelo
would like to have known by everyone.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.809
You see?

17:00.644 --> 17:02.562
And they're not beautiful, señor?

17:03.188 --> 17:05.690
Can you make the picture
how she will look?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.692
You sure you want me to do that?

17:07.859 --> 17:08.984
No. No, señor.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.820
Do not make the picture.
It is best for me to do it.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.656
I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
but I'm looking for a...

17:16.785 --> 17:19.871
Those things have great possibilities,
but not for you.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.625
What are you doing here?

17:25.502 --> 17:29.589
Until I saw those things, I was looking
for a towel. I'd like to take a bath.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.216
-Didn't you come in on the stage?
-That's right.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.885
Why aren't you on it?

17:34.344 --> 17:36.804
Whoever heard of a stagecoach
having a bathroom?

17:37.139 --> 17:40.141
Chihuahua! I forgot.
I start to tell you and I forgot.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.311
-The stage, she did not go.
-Why?

17:43.479 --> 17:45.813
-Something happened with the wheel.
-Where's Jake?

17:45.981 --> 17:46.981
Near the corral.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.234
-He must fix the wheel before he can leave.
-That's just fine.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.406
Hey, sheriff, you forgot your pants.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.669
You reckon they'd try anything tonight?

18:50.045 --> 18:53.339
Could be . Nathan Burdette's smart.
Don't underrate him.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.174
That ain't no kind of answer.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.802
How or what he'll do, I don't know.

18:58.595 --> 19:02.557
-Your guess is as good as mine.
-Well, what I wanna know is when.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.226
I wish he'd hurry up and do it.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.156
Have a bottle of beer, Dude?

19:18.323 --> 19:20.074
I'm full of beer.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.035
It doesn't do any good.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.913
It'll start working on you tomorrow
or the next day.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.087
Stumpy.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.090
We're gonna take a turn
around the town.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.886
-You be all right?
-Of course I'll be all right.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.762
Then get in there where you belong.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.557
I'm going. I'm going.
But you remember one thing:

19:45.267 --> 19:47.935
When you come back,
you holler before you open that door.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.605
I'm liable to blast you
just for the heck of it.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.273
We'll holler.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.450
You got any particular reason
for going out tonight?

20:02.618 --> 20:03.784
Usually do.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.705
Don't wanna do anything different,
they might think we're scared.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.457
Well, aren't we?

20:11.293 --> 20:13.586
I just can't take it sitting in there.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.088
You mean you saw I couldn't take it.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.258
Don't set yourself up as being so special.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.011
You'd think you invented the hangover.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.972
I could sure take out a patent for this one .

20:28.685 --> 20:29.977
Take that side.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.433
-Good evening.
-Yes, sir.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.802
Hold it, Dude. Stairway.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.846
Don't shoot, sheriff.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.723
Just getting a little air.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.467
I'm getting jumpy.

23:06.635 --> 23:09.136
I'll walk along with you
and hold your hand.

23:09.346 --> 23:12.264
-Get back over there where you belong.
-Yes, Papa.

23:26.446 --> 23:29.156
-Carlos.
-Señor Chance. I been looking for you.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.409
-It is very bad, señor.
-What's wrong?

23:31.576 --> 23:33.661
-Your friend Señor Wheeler.
-What about him?

23:33.829 --> 23:37.540
He is a good friend
and he wishes good for you, so he talks.

23:37.707 --> 23:40.251
He talks to people. He talk to everybody.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.671
He say, "Why they don't help you?"
That you should have some more help.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.339
He's right, Señor Chance.

23:45.507 --> 23:48.175
But is no good to say such things
to the wrong people.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.136
-You tell him.
-Is he in there?

23:50.303 --> 23:51.762
Sí, I think.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.349
Chance, he's over there.

23:56.476 --> 23:59.854
-The queens full.
-That's good. Beats me.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.989
Spare a minute , Pat?

24:10.157 --> 24:11.490
Good evening, sheriff.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.826
-Deal me out.
-Evening.

24:24.421 --> 24:27.298
-You two know each other.
-Yeah.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.049
No, thanks, Carlos.

24:29.634 --> 24:33.512
-Chance, I've been wanting to talk to you.
-You've been talking too much, Pat.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.182
-What do you mean "talking too much"?
-Anybody that...

24:36.349 --> 24:40.769
...sides in with me right now's liable to find
themselves up to their ears in trouble.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.898
Is that why you haven't asked
for any deputies?

24:44.065 --> 24:47.568
Give me a new deck of cards.
I'm not having any luck with this one.

24:48.361 --> 24:52.740
I was talking about why you haven't asked
for any new deputies. You could get some.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.909
How about my drivers?
You could use them.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.911
Suppose I got them, what'd I have?

24:57.496 --> 24:59.288
Some well-meaning amateurs.

24:59.456 --> 25:02.166
Most of them worried
about their wives and kids.

25:03.043 --> 25:05.920
Burdette has 30 or 40 men,
all professionals.

25:06.254 --> 25:09.715
Only thing they're worried about
is earning their pay.

25:10.509 --> 25:15.262
No, Pat, all I'd be doing is giving them
more targets to shoot at.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.223
A lot of people'd get hurt.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.391
Joe Burdette isn't worth it.

25:19.559 --> 25:21.769
He isn't worth one of those
that'd get killed.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.938
Then what are you gonna do?

25:24.105 --> 25:27.024
All you got for help's that old man
down at the jail and this--

25:27.192 --> 25:29.610
Borrachón's the name, Mr. Wheeler.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.821
I'll go outside so you can talk more freely.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.953
Wasn't good, Pat.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.540
-Let's sit down.
-Yeah, I know.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.627
I shouldn't have said it.
I meant nothing by it.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.588
But I'm so used to stumbling
over that fellow.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.591
I don't think I ever saw him
standing on his own two feet...

25:52.759 --> 25:54.718
...without something
to help hold him up.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.595
How long you been coming here?

25:56.763 --> 25:58.138
Going on two years.

25:58.306 --> 26:02.059
If you'd have come through three years
ago, you wouldn't have stumbled over him.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.686
Dude was good.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.145
He was my deputy.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.481
Best man with a gun I ever worked with.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.858
That's pretty hard to believe , Chance .

26:10.026 --> 26:11.944
-What--?
-A girl.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.321
Just a girl that came through on the stage.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.408
She was no good,
but couldn't tell him that.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.827
I tried and he damn near killed me.

26:21.121 --> 26:24.248
Anyway, he was hooked.
Went away with her.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.875
Six months later
he came back without her.

26:27.043 --> 26:30.379
That's when the Mexicans
started calling him borrachón.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.423
-That's Spanish for--
-Yeah, I know.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.174
He told me.

26:35.051 --> 26:38.012
So for two years he's been drinking...

26:38.388 --> 26:43.767
...all he could buy, or somebody'd
buy for him till last night.

26:44.477 --> 26:46.520
And how long do you think that'll last?

26:46.688 --> 26:47.855
I don't know.

26:48.648 --> 26:51.650
So in the meantime,
you have to take care of him, huh?

26:51.818 --> 26:55.195
He's been doing a pretty good job
of taking care of me.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.824
I'm supposed to be your friend too.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.619
Why don't you let me help you?
Deal me in.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.371
-You're not good enough.
-I don't know! I'm as good--

27:04.539 --> 27:07.708
If you're so good,
why did you have to hire Colorado?

27:07.876 --> 27:10.794
-No, thanks, Pat, you keep out of it.
-Hey, that's an idea.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.672
-What?
-Ryan. Colorado you call him.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.508
He's young, Chance, but he's good.
Real good.

27:17.218 --> 27:20.387
I could use him if he's good.
But that's up to him.

27:21.097 --> 27:22.723
We'll see what he says.

27:42.577 --> 27:45.579
-Good evening, sheriff.
-Any luck, kid?

27:45.997 --> 27:48.499
-It's a pretty fast game.
-Son, I ...

27:48.750 --> 27:52.002
...asked you over here
because the sheriff's a friend of mine.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.922
He's got trouble. He can use a good man.

27:55.590 --> 27:58.926
-To go against the Burdettes, sheriff?
-That's right.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.053
I told him you were one of the best.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.473
Well...

28:05.975 --> 28:08.435
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at,
Mr. Wheeler.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.604
That's minding my own business.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.272
No offense, sheriff.

28:13.608 --> 28:14.817
No offense.

28:20.448 --> 28:22.825
Well, I never expected that.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.785
He showed good sense.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.538
-I'd like to have him.
-I don't see why you--

28:27.706 --> 28:29.790
Quit stewing, Pat. You tried.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.417
I appreciate it.

28:31.626 --> 28:34.002
If you don't want me,
I'll round up my men...

28:34.170 --> 28:37.923
...and get set for an early start
in the morning. See you before I go.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.804
Enough for me for a while.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.180
You leaving?

28:45.348 --> 28:48.267
-Maybe I'll have some luck now.
-Maybe.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.310
If you play your cards right.

28:50.478 --> 28:52.438
Hope you leave
some of your luck with me .

28:52.689 --> 28:55.315
I'll come back
and give it to you next time.

28:55.483 --> 28:56.942
We'll ante up.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.238
-Dude?
-Yeah?

29:02.157 --> 29:04.324
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.346
Oh, hi, sheriff.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.641
I'm sorry about those pants.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.810
Carlos told me they weren't yours.

29:31.978 --> 29:34.730
You're in trouble, lady.
I'd like to talk to you.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.357
Sure.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.364
Well, sheriff, what is it?

29:44.991 --> 29:48.035
I was looking through the deck of cards
you people were using.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.038
It's three cards short.

29:51.706 --> 29:54.124
Pretty obvious ones, aces.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.044
Why--?
Well, why do you tell me?

29:57.504 --> 30:01.840
I know everyone in that game except you
and the fellow in the checkered vest.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.384
-And did you talk to him?
-He's still there.

30:04.552 --> 30:05.844
You were leaving.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.972
And I was a winner.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.391
Is that all you've got to go on?

30:12.227 --> 30:15.604
No. Here's a handbill...

30:17.065 --> 30:20.317
...about a gambler
they're interested in catching up with.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.194
You know him?

30:22.654 --> 30:24.530
It says he had a girl with him.

30:25.406 --> 30:29.493
Says the girI's about 22,
5 foot 5 inches tall...

30:30.328 --> 30:34.706
...good figure, brown hair,
and wears feathers.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.920
Now, the man isn't our...

30:40.088 --> 30:43.257
...friend in the checkered vest
but you could be the girl.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.802
Yes, I could be.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.596
As a matter of fact, I am.

30:52.892 --> 30:55.435
Make sure you're on the stage
in the morning.

30:55.603 --> 31:00.232
You'd better give me the money you won.
I'll see that it gets back to the right people.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.151
It's pretty easy, isn't it?

31:03.611 --> 31:08.115
Just give you the money
and get on the stage.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.827
But I'm not gonna make it that easy.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.789
You've made me mad, sheriff.
You didn't ask me if I took those cards.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.125
So you're gonna have to prove
I've got them.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.794
The only way I know you can do that
is to search me.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.629
-Search you?
-That's right.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.757
Isn't that what a sheriff usually does
to a prisoner?

31:25.925 --> 31:29.428
Let's see,
the cards could be in my purse...

31:29.596 --> 31:31.221
...but they're not.

31:32.015 --> 31:34.683
They could be in my shoes,
my stockings, garters.

31:34.851 --> 31:38.061
-All right, all right.
-I don't wear anything like those red pants.

31:38.229 --> 31:41.273
And my sleeves are too tight,
but there's my waist.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.276
You've got a job to do,
where do you intend to begin?

31:44.444 --> 31:47.279
-That's about enough.
-You have to prove I've got those cards.

31:47.447 --> 31:50.407
-You keep going and I'm apt to do it!
-I'm not so sure.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.785
I think you're embarrassed.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.079
-And if you're not--
-If he's not...

31:56.247 --> 31:57.331
...he ought to be.

31:57.498 --> 31:58.999
What're you doing here?

31:59.334 --> 32:01.001
I don't think she has the cards.

32:01.502 --> 32:03.587
If that's what you're looking for.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.672
How do you know?

32:05.840 --> 32:08.175
I think the fellow in the checkered vest
has them.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.843
Well, why didn't you find out?

32:10.178 --> 32:12.846
I said I wouldn't start anything
till I told you first.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.390
Now I'm telling you.
I'm gonna see if he's got them.

32:15.558 --> 32:17.017
Wait a minute.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.312
-You wanna come along?
-I do.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.189
I'm interested too.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.418
Ace high straight.

32:43.920 --> 32:47.047
Looks like I got the lady's luck.
How come--?

32:47.215 --> 32:49.341
All right, keep your hands on the table.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.009
Right where they are.

32:52.887 --> 32:54.638
Put your hands back.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.181
Where they were.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.238
Hold out.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.865
He's all yours, sheriff.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.242
Get up.

33:16.452 --> 33:17.536
Get up!

33:19.455 --> 33:22.040
We don't like tinhorns around here, mister.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.668
Carlos, lock him in his room.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.254
Let him out in time for the stage.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.674
You losers can help yourself
to what's on the table.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.426
Thanks, Colorado.

33:32.593 --> 33:36.263
Sheriff, aren't you forgetting something?

33:46.065 --> 33:49.568
I guess I was wrong about you
having those cards.

33:50.445 --> 33:51.987
Is that all, sheriff?

33:52.280 --> 33:55.115
Well, I'm not gonna apologize,
if that's what you mean.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.326
We haven't gotten past that handbill,
have we?

33:58.494 --> 33:59.536
That's right.

33:59.996 --> 34:02.873
You haven't done anything
to make me think we will.

34:03.624 --> 34:06.293
ldea of being searched
didn't bother you much.

34:06.961 --> 34:07.961
Made a joke of it.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.755
Instead of me being embarrassed,
you were.

34:10.922 --> 34:14.134
Tell me, sheriff,
what should I have done?

34:14.844 --> 34:16.178
-Well--
-I'd like to know.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.598
This isn't the first time
that handbill has come up.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.600
I'd like to know what to do about it.

34:22.143 --> 34:26.396
Well, you could quit playing cards...

34:26.563 --> 34:27.981
...wearing feathers.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.483
No, sheriff.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.860
No, I'm not gonna do that.

34:34.155 --> 34:37.949
You see, that's what I'd do...

34:39.494 --> 34:42.329
...if I were the kind of girl
that you think I am.

35:02.391 --> 35:03.934
Dude, you seen Wheeler?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.977
Not since he went up the street.

35:06.145 --> 35:08.021
I think that's him coming now.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.745
Get him out of here!

35:29.127 --> 35:31.962
Watch the stable.
That's where the shot came from.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.258
Got him in the back.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.051
He's dead.

35:40.596 --> 35:44.516
Didn't take them long,
less than an hour after he offered to help.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.061
Don't get many friends like that.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.231
You were smart, Colorado.

35:51.399 --> 35:54.484
-No one's come out of the stable.
-I wanna go with you.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.237
Wanna help get the man
that killed your boss?

35:57.738 --> 36:00.240
-Wouldn't you?
-I wouldn't have let him get shot.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.993
You had a chance to get in this
and you didn't want it.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.120
Stay out, we don't need you.

36:05.288 --> 36:08.039
You wanna do something,
get him out of the street.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.755
Get around to the side
where you can see front and back.

36:16.257 --> 36:17.424
How you going in?

36:17.592 --> 36:20.802
Right through the door.
If he comes out, you can have him.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.763
There's no sense in me
telling you to cool down.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.433
-No, there isn't.
-I thought so.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.727
I'll let you know when I get there.

37:33.542 --> 37:35.168
Chance, you all right?

37:51.978 --> 37:53.603
Chance, out here .

37:54.689 --> 37:55.855
You all right?

37:56.023 --> 37:58.024
Just dirt in my eyes. Did you get him?

37:58.192 --> 38:00.026
He came out the door, running fast.

38:00.194 --> 38:02.362
-You missed him.
-I couldn't get a good shot.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.907
-Might've winged him.
-Don't worry. It's my fault we lost him.

38:06.075 --> 38:07.450
He hasn't got away yet...

38:07.618 --> 38:10.328
...or I wouldn't be standing here.
He went in the saloon.

38:10.496 --> 38:12.706
-He's still in there.
-How do you know?

38:13.207 --> 38:16.543
Can see both doors from here.
And there ain't any others.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.045
I'm an expert on saloons.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.257
-Get a chance to see who he was?
-No, but we'll know.

38:22.425 --> 38:26.386
He'll have muddy boots.
He stepped in that puddle by the trough.

38:27.221 --> 38:29.431
You figure we're going in there after him?

38:29.598 --> 38:31.308
-Aren't we?
-We used to.

38:32.184 --> 38:34.728
There's eight or ten Burdette men in there.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.063
Maybe more.

38:38.441 --> 38:41.067
You take the back door, I'll go in the front.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.987
-I'd like to try--
-You'd like to try what?

38:45.614 --> 38:47.574
I been going in the back door.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.243
They haven't been letting me in the front.

38:51.787 --> 38:54.914
-Think you're good enough?
-I'd like to find out.

38:55.374 --> 38:56.583
So would I .

38:57.585 --> 38:59.586
I'll let you know when I get around back.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.234
Begin with you, Charlie.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.153
That shotgun you keep under the bar.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.989
Pick it up by the barrel.

40:10.491 --> 40:11.658
Easy.

40:11.826 --> 40:15.495
Thought you were gonna ask for a drink.
It's been a long dry spell.

40:15.746 --> 40:16.996
Shotgun first.

40:17.832 --> 40:18.998
Set it down.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.668
Back up.

40:26.674 --> 40:31.010
Jim, Pedro, get over there.

40:37.184 --> 40:41.146
All right, the rest of you,
I'm not gonna tell you twice.

40:41.939 --> 40:45.191
You're gonna stand up
and stand real still.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.193
Now!

40:51.782 --> 40:56.703
All right, now one by one,
start with you, unbuckle your guns...

40:56.954 --> 40:58.705
...drop them and step back.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.500
Come on.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.718
There's no reason
for you to move, Charlie.

41:16.390 --> 41:20.059
-What's this all about?
-We're looking for a man that ran in here.

41:20.227 --> 41:21.853
Nobody's run in here.

41:22.021 --> 41:24.189
We'll remember you said that.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.860
Man we're looking for has muddy boots.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.863
Now, one by one, hold up your feet.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.589
Who saw a man run in here?

41:50.799 --> 41:52.175
I did.

41:53.177 --> 41:55.803
Almost forgot about you, Charlie.
Come on out.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.307
Clean as a whistle.

41:59.850 --> 42:02.018
Dude, you been seeing things again.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.853
You better have a drink.

42:06.232 --> 42:10.735
Dude. Maybe this'll help.

42:52.236 --> 42:54.571
Guess I'll take that drink now, Charlie .

42:55.281 --> 42:56.990
I thought you would.

43:04.707 --> 43:06.666
You want that gun, pick it up.

43:08.168 --> 43:10.003
I wish you would.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.801
He stepped in a puddle, all right.

43:17.678 --> 43:19.429
He's the fellow we wanted.

43:21.890 --> 43:23.349
I guess this is his.

43:23.517 --> 43:25.810
A nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

43:26.645 --> 43:30.231
It's just about what Burdette would figure
a man's life was worth.

43:31.025 --> 43:33.109
That's earning money the hard way.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.114
Paid killer.

43:39.366 --> 43:42.410
Nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.748
You, mister, you got one in your pocket?

43:47.041 --> 43:48.458
Nobody paid me.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.001
Nobody!

43:50.502 --> 43:53.046
And nobody run in here, either, huh?

43:54.006 --> 43:55.048
Chance.

43:55.215 --> 43:58.301
Oh, I'm not gonna hurt him.
Get up!

44:00.054 --> 44:01.429
You're all in it.

44:02.598 --> 44:04.140
The whole lot of you.

44:05.309 --> 44:07.226
You're gonna get out of town.

44:07.770 --> 44:09.729
Take your boy here with you.

44:10.981 --> 44:13.274
You can tell Burdette you got Wheeler.

44:14.193 --> 44:17.570
You can tell him anybody else he sends,
he'd better pay them more...

44:17.738 --> 44:19.739
...because they're gonna earn it.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.909
Charlie, I want you to...

44:26.080 --> 44:27.538
You finished yet, Dude?

44:28.332 --> 44:30.833
-You in a hurry?
-Not especially.

44:41.845 --> 44:44.222
You threw the silver dollar, didn't you?

44:44.556 --> 44:46.683
-Yeah, Dude, l--
-You want it back?

44:47.643 --> 44:49.644
-Sure.
-You know how to get it?

44:52.314 --> 44:53.648
Yeah.

45:10.124 --> 45:11.708
That's all for me, Chance.

45:12.584 --> 45:15.002
-Charlie, come here .
-Yeah, sheriff.

45:15.170 --> 45:16.462
You're going with us.

45:16.630 --> 45:18.464
Why pick on me? Why choose me?

45:18.632 --> 45:21.300
You're carrying these guns
down to the jail for us.

45:21.468 --> 45:23.720
All right, back up and give him room.

45:27.933 --> 45:30.768
I guess they'll let you
in the front door from now on.

45:37.317 --> 45:40.820
You mean to tell me you followed him
into Burdette's saloon?

45:41.363 --> 45:42.905
Why, you're crazy!

45:43.073 --> 45:45.366
And you are too. What happened?

45:45.993 --> 45:47.410
He was hiding in the loft.

45:47.578 --> 45:50.413
-Who got him?
-Dude did. One shot.

45:51.623 --> 45:53.332
I wish I could've seen that.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.334
I wish Wheeler could've too.

45:55.836 --> 45:58.504
Wheeler didn't think
Dude and me was much good.

45:58.756 --> 46:01.674
Leastways it would've showed him
he was wrong about Dude.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.968
He was wrong about Dude, all right.

46:04.428 --> 46:06.429
You were good in there tonight.

46:07.014 --> 46:08.514
Good as you've ever been.

46:09.183 --> 46:11.893
But you know one reason
why you got by with it?

46:12.352 --> 46:16.022
They were laughing at you.
Borrachón talking big.

46:16.356 --> 46:19.609
You surprised them.
But next time they'll be ready for you.

46:19.777 --> 46:22.111
Next time they'll shoot first
and laugh afterwards.

46:22.279 --> 46:25.156
-Listen to him.
-Don't get too cocksure.

46:25.324 --> 46:27.200
What a stinker!
Spit in his eye, Dude.

46:27.367 --> 46:29.744
Never mind him,
he's always been a stinker.

46:29.912 --> 46:32.371
If he were to change,
that would worry me.

46:34.374 --> 46:36.876
You'd think I could get one
out of a whole sack.

46:37.044 --> 46:39.545
How'd you know
that fellow was in the loft?

46:40.047 --> 46:43.382
He was losing blood.
It was dripping into a drink on the bar.

46:43.759 --> 46:46.385
Just when I couldn't find anybody
with muddy boots.

46:46.553 --> 46:48.513
I could've sure used a drink then.

46:48.680 --> 46:51.724
If he was bleeding that means
you hit him on the run outside.

46:51.892 --> 46:55.061
You did, Dude? Say, that ain't bad.
That ain't bad at all.

46:55.229 --> 46:58.356
Ain't good either.
We had to go in after him.

46:59.316 --> 47:02.819
Chance, nobody please you no how?

47:03.237 --> 47:04.904
You got a light, Stumpy?

47:05.239 --> 47:08.407
Hey, in the jail! It's me, Colorado.

47:09.076 --> 47:10.076
Let him in.

47:12.913 --> 47:14.121
Come on in.

47:17.668 --> 47:19.752
I hear you got the man who shot Wheeler.

47:20.379 --> 47:21.629
Dude did.

47:23.257 --> 47:24.757
Thanks, Dude.

47:26.635 --> 47:28.511
Gonna bury him in the morning.

47:28.679 --> 47:31.097
I've just been to the undertaker's with him.

47:31.265 --> 47:33.599
Here's the money and the papers
he had on him.

47:33.767 --> 47:35.726
I took out $60 he owed me.

47:36.645 --> 47:38.020
You got yours.

47:38.355 --> 47:39.814
How about the rest?

47:40.023 --> 47:41.816
Did he owe them too?

47:42.025 --> 47:43.234
Probably did.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.820
I didn't think about that.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.948
I can't turn anything over to you
till I get a court order.

47:49.449 --> 47:52.618
-Does that mean you hold the wagons too?
-That's right.

47:52.786 --> 47:54.495
Meantime, I'm broke.

47:55.372 --> 47:58.541
If you or any of the rest are
short eating money...

47:58.834 --> 48:02.169
...I'll go good for it.
I'll tell them at the hotel.

48:02.504 --> 48:05.715
I wish you'd do that soon,
before anything happens to you.

48:06.216 --> 48:08.009
No offense again, sheriff.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.974
It's nice to see a smart kid for a change.

48:15.142 --> 48:17.935
Yeah, he ain't like
the usual kid with a gun.

48:19.146 --> 48:21.147
I wonder if
he's as good as Wheeler said.

48:22.149 --> 48:23.649
I'd say he is.

48:24.693 --> 48:27.528
I'd say he's so good,
he doesn't feel he has to prove it.

48:37.414 --> 48:40.291
-Don't you ever sleep?
-I was beginning to think you didn't.

48:40.459 --> 48:41.751
I wanted to talk to you.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.170
Don't tell me you're still looking
for an apology.

48:44.338 --> 48:47.924
No. No, I was thinking of making one .

48:48.467 --> 48:50.468
I was pretty much of a....

48:50.886 --> 48:53.721
I got out of line tonight
and I'm not proud of it.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.806
My only excuse is...

48:56.183 --> 48:59.060
...I didn't know about all
the trouble you were in.

49:06.526 --> 49:09.654
I'm gonna have a drink. How about you?

49:10.155 --> 49:12.490
Thanks, I'd like one.

49:14.660 --> 49:17.495
I'm sorry about Mr. Wheeler.

49:17.871 --> 49:19.956
Carlos told me he was a friend of yours.

49:20.707 --> 49:24.210
That's why he got shot.
Or did Carlos tell you that too?

49:24.378 --> 49:25.795
Yes, he told me.

49:27.297 --> 49:31.300
How does--?
How does a man get to be a sheriff?

49:31.969 --> 49:34.762
Gets lazy. Gets tired...

49:35.013 --> 49:36.764
...of selling his gun all over...

49:36.932 --> 49:38.724
...decides to sell it in one place.

49:39.059 --> 49:40.935
I'd say you made a poor sale.

49:41.228 --> 49:43.729
A lot of people around here
will agree with you.

49:43.897 --> 49:47.692
But it's still a sale
and it's too late to back out.

49:47.859 --> 49:51.904
Not to change the subject, but how does
a girl get herself on a handbill?

49:52.823 --> 49:54.448
She gets married.

49:55.242 --> 49:58.119
-Handbill says he was a cheat.
-He wasn't a cheat then.

49:58.912 --> 50:02.373
That came later, after his luck turned.

50:03.542 --> 50:05.751
It was probably my fault he cheated.

50:05.919 --> 50:07.920
He liked to buy me things.

50:08.130 --> 50:10.881
-Then why did you leave him?
-I didn't.

50:11.550 --> 50:14.427
He left me rather suddenly.

50:15.679 --> 50:18.180
He was caught just like that man tonight...

50:19.266 --> 50:21.183
...only his luck had run out.

50:21.518 --> 50:23.060
He was shot.

50:24.146 --> 50:25.855
You've had a rough time.

50:27.899 --> 50:30.943
You're wrong, sheriff.
I've had a good time.

50:31.570 --> 50:33.446
I liked gambling.

50:33.697 --> 50:36.782
We went everywhere,
had the best of everything.

50:38.035 --> 50:42.455
I didn't know that he was cheating
until they caught him.

50:44.458 --> 50:46.584
If I had known, it might have been rough.

50:46.752 --> 50:48.919
That's probably why he didn't tell me.

50:49.087 --> 50:50.588
When did this happen?

50:50.756 --> 50:52.882
About four months ago.

50:54.801 --> 50:58.429
Since then I've been working...

50:59.306 --> 51:01.682
...to get enough money for stage fare.

51:02.017 --> 51:05.144
-You going home?
-I haven't any.

51:05.312 --> 51:06.604
Señor Chance!

51:06.772 --> 51:09.356
I didn't know you were here.
Why do you not tell me?

51:09.524 --> 51:12.860
You should be in bed.
Last night you slept just a little bit.

51:13.028 --> 51:15.905
But tonight, señor, you will sleep well.
I will watch.

51:16.073 --> 51:18.240
No, Carlos, you stay out of it.

51:18.408 --> 51:20.659
Don't want anybody else helping me.

51:21.328 --> 51:24.622
Señor Chance, this is my hotel...

51:24.831 --> 51:26.832
...and you are a guest under my roof.

51:27.501 --> 51:31.337
And I will not be told what I shall do
and what I shall not do, señor.

51:32.839 --> 51:34.882
-All right, Carlos.
-What you do?

51:35.050 --> 51:37.718
-I'll sleep in the jail.
-But you can't sleep...

51:39.179 --> 51:41.764
There's no need to watch.
I'm a light sleeper.

51:41.932 --> 51:44.683
I'll lock the door
and hook a chair under the knob.

51:44.851 --> 51:47.228
Anybody tries to get in, I'll hear them.

51:47.395 --> 51:48.896
-One thing.
-What?

51:49.064 --> 51:51.357
If I'm asleep at sunup, wake me.

51:52.150 --> 51:54.151
-But it's not enough.
-Will you?

51:55.737 --> 51:57.905
I say no more.
Have a good sleep.

51:58.073 --> 52:00.199
I don't want to meddle in your business.

52:00.367 --> 52:01.700
I'm gonna turn in.

52:02.285 --> 52:05.746
-If I don't see you in the morning, so long.
-So long.

52:06.123 --> 52:09.083
By the way, where are you going?

52:09.543 --> 52:12.211
Some place where
there aren't any handbills.

52:12.379 --> 52:16.382
That thing keeps popping up.
That's why I'm a little touchy about it.

52:18.051 --> 52:20.511
I know the sheriff that got these out.

52:21.638 --> 52:24.557
I'll write him a letter, get them called in.

52:25.559 --> 52:28.853
Then you won't have people like me
making trouble for you.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.822
Well...

52:41.908 --> 52:43.117
Thanks.

53:23.825 --> 53:25.868
-Carlos!
-Señor.

53:26.036 --> 53:28.913
It's after 7 . Why didn't you wake me up?
You said you would.

53:29.080 --> 53:30.247
-The girl.
-The girl?

53:30.415 --> 53:33.250
-That one with the feathers.
-What's she got to do with it?

53:33.418 --> 53:34.960
She told me not to wake you.

53:35.128 --> 53:37.296
She was sitting outside your room
in a chair.

53:37.464 --> 53:40.549
-Sitting outside my room in a chair?
-All night long.

53:40.717 --> 53:42.843
She was still there
two, three minutes ago.

53:43.011 --> 53:46.555
Most likely she hear you get up.
She told me not to wake you, señor.

53:46.723 --> 53:48.474
Well, you can tell her...

53:49.059 --> 53:51.518
-The fool!
-Tell her she's a fool?

53:51.686 --> 53:54.563
No! I'll tell her myself.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.440
You tell her she's a fool?

53:56.608 --> 53:58.108
I didn't say I was.

53:59.361 --> 54:01.320
He say , "Not to wake him up."

54:01.488 --> 54:03.572
She say, "To wake him up."

54:03.740 --> 54:05.699
Me, I'm in the middle.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.330
-Who is it?
-It's me, the sheriff.

54:11.498 --> 54:13.082
Oh, just a minute.

54:20.215 --> 54:21.465
Come on in.

54:25.679 --> 54:26.887
Hi.

54:27.347 --> 54:30.140
-Did you get a good night's sleep?
-Who, me?

54:30.308 --> 54:32.434
Yes, you.
There's nobody else in the room.

54:33.353 --> 54:35.396
Carlos had to go and talk.

54:36.439 --> 54:39.900
I couldn't sleep anyway.
I was just as well off out there in the hall.

54:40.068 --> 54:43.612
If anybody had come in, you'd have yelled
before they shot you. Is that it?

54:43.780 --> 54:44.780
Fool women.

54:44.948 --> 54:46.991
-Didn't you hear me say that--?
-I know.

54:47.158 --> 54:50.202
You don't want anyone to help you.
I heard you tell Carlos.

54:50.370 --> 54:52.997
-Why did you do it?
-You weren't supposed to know.

54:53.164 --> 54:55.666
Why didn't you just go out
and not talk to Carlos?

54:55.834 --> 54:59.837
-He didn't wake me up!
-Don't blame him, that was my fault.

55:00.088 --> 55:02.548
All right, nothing happened,
nobody got hurt.

55:02.716 --> 55:05.009
You got some sleep, I lost some.

55:05.176 --> 55:08.304
Now I'm tired and you're mad
and I'm getting mad. So...

55:08.471 --> 55:09.888
...you'd better go on.

55:10.056 --> 55:12.057
I'm gonna get some sleep too.

55:12.225 --> 55:14.059
Well, you can't go to bed now.

55:14.561 --> 55:15.769
I can't?

55:16.313 --> 55:18.897
Well, you just see whether or not
I can go to bed now--

55:19.065 --> 55:21.233
You've got to get on that stagecoach.

55:21.401 --> 55:24.111
-What did you say?
-The stage, it leaves in an hour.

55:24.279 --> 55:26.739
-Well, why didn't you tell me?
-I just did!

55:26.906 --> 55:31.493
Well, then you better get out then,
so I can get a bath and pack my things.

55:31.661 --> 55:33.871
I can't do it if you stand around talking.

55:34.039 --> 55:35.622
You're doing most of the talking.

55:35.790 --> 55:38.375
That's right. And I can't do that
and bathe and pack.

55:38.543 --> 55:40.461
-Will you just go on and go?
-I'm going.

55:40.628 --> 55:42.296
Then do it, don't talk any more.

55:42.464 --> 55:45.257
I'm doing enough
and neither of us are saying anything.

55:45.425 --> 55:47.926
So, just go on
and let me get on the stage.

55:49.095 --> 55:51.138
Oh, hell! Goodbye.

55:51.765 --> 55:53.432
But I just wanted to...

55:54.726 --> 55:56.935
You could have at least let me finish.

55:57.771 --> 56:01.648
You try to help someone
who doesn't want any help.

56:02.776 --> 56:05.569
I guess I talk too much.

56:06.946 --> 56:08.030
You tell her?

56:08.198 --> 56:10.449
-Tell her what?
-That she's a fool.

56:12.285 --> 56:13.577
She's going on the stage?

56:13.745 --> 56:16.080
She's going on the stage .
You make sure she does.

56:16.247 --> 56:18.624
You say she was going,
why should I make sure?

56:18.792 --> 56:21.043
Because I say for you
to make sure she does.

56:21.211 --> 56:22.461
I hold you responsible.

56:22.629 --> 56:24.880
Responsible, me? Yes.

56:28.301 --> 56:31.470
Dude, he's up the street.
He told me to tell you he's gone.

56:31.638 --> 56:32.888
So I see .

56:33.640 --> 56:36.642
There's a lot of people in town today.

56:37.143 --> 56:38.560
Did you hear why?

56:38.728 --> 56:43.232
A man say he hear maybe Nathan Burdette
will come to see you today.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.401
Most likely they here to watch.

56:45.944 --> 56:49.655
Well, if he does,
they may see something.

56:49.823 --> 56:52.616
-I don't like it.
-Neither do I .

56:58.832 --> 57:02.042
Tom, hang your gun on the fence .
You'll pick it up when you leave.

57:02.210 --> 57:05.003
Sure enough.

57:30.530 --> 57:32.156
That's far enough.

57:32.365 --> 57:34.491
I got orders to take your guns.

57:35.160 --> 57:37.286
Suppose we don't wanna give them up?

57:37.454 --> 57:40.164
Think you're good enough
to take them against six of us?

57:40.331 --> 57:43.417
For a smart man, Mr. Burdette,
that's pretty stupid.

57:43.960 --> 57:47.379
You won't need a gun no more
because you'll be the first man I'd get.

57:47.547 --> 57:48.881
Come on, let's go.

57:49.048 --> 57:51.049
Harris, you're pretty good right there.

57:54.220 --> 57:56.930
-Hold it, Harris!
-He cut my rein.

57:57.098 --> 58:00.225
I'd say he did it on purpose.
And I'm telling you to hold it.

58:04.814 --> 58:08.901
Now just hang your guns on the fence
and you can pick them up when you leave.

58:09.068 --> 58:10.444
Hang up your guns.

58:18.620 --> 58:21.163
You're pretty good with that gun
when you're sober.

58:21.331 --> 58:24.500
-Not bad, Mr. Burdette.
-How does that happen?

58:24.667 --> 58:28.086
If you mean being good with a gun,
I've had a lot of practice.

58:28.630 --> 58:30.631
If you mean being sober...

58:30.798 --> 58:33.717
...I'm getting practice on account
of your brother.

58:33.885 --> 58:35.093
I don't follow you.

58:35.261 --> 58:37.721
You don't have to follow me,
Mr. Burdette. Matt!

58:38.765 --> 58:41.141
Didn't you hear the boss say
that I was sober?

58:41.309 --> 58:44.353
That extra gun in your vest,
lay that on the fence too.

58:48.233 --> 58:51.610
-You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
-All right, Mr. Burdette...

58:51.778 --> 58:54.404
...let's get going.
I got no more to talk to you about.

58:54.572 --> 58:56.448
You should enjoy it, Dude.

58:56.658 --> 59:00.285
Every man should have a little taste
of power before he's through.

59:20.723 --> 59:21.974
Stumpy!

59:22.475 --> 59:24.268
Burdette and his men are coming in.

59:24.435 --> 59:26.979
Well, don't put down
no red carpet for them.

59:27.146 --> 59:29.606
And I'm staying right
where I'm supposed to.

59:29.774 --> 59:30.983
You do that.

59:34.153 --> 59:35.571
Good morning, sheriff.

59:36.322 --> 59:37.656
Hello, Burdette.

59:38.408 --> 59:40.158
Been expecting you.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.244
I want to see my brother.

59:42.412 --> 59:43.787
You can come in.

59:44.706 --> 59:48.709
But that doesn't mean the rest of you.
He's not your brother.

59:48.876 --> 59:51.003
Go on across the street with the others.

59:51.170 --> 59:52.671
Do as he says.

59:54.424 --> 59:56.425
What're all those people doing in town?

59:56.676 --> 59:58.135
I didn't ask.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:02.848
Didn't ask them to come,
or ask them why they're here.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:06.184
But I think they're watching to see
what you're gonna do.

01:00:08.646 --> 01:00:12.232
You don't like that, do you?
Too many witnesses.

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:16.320
Now do you wanna keep talking to me
or see your brother?

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.697
See my brother.

01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:22.868
We're coming in, Stumpy.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:26.371
Well, come ahead.
Don't wait for me to carry you.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.173
All right, Stumpy, open up.

01:00:36.924 --> 01:00:38.342
What's the password?

01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:42.346
-Come on.
-Oh, I'm coming. I wouldn't miss this.

01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:46.350
Just want him to see how we're set up.
Well, look who's here.

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.894
Place is getting all cluttered up
with Burdettes.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.395
Come right in, Mr. Burdette.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:54.066
That fellow round the corner
with a banged-up face is your brother.

01:00:54.233 --> 01:00:55.233
Nathan.

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.195
Well, Joe.

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:00.739
Looks like they gave you a going-over.

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.491
Our friend here .

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:04.785
Why?

01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:08.580
He didn't take too kindly
to being arrested for murder.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.290
It wasn't murder.

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:13.335
If he says it wasn't murder,
why do you say it was?

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:17.547
Man gets shot that's got a gun,
there's room for reasonable doubt.

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:21.885
Man gets shot that hasn't got a gun,
what would you call it?

01:01:22.595 --> 01:01:23.970
But you knew that already...

01:01:24.138 --> 01:01:27.391
...otherwise you wouldn't have
set things up the way you did.

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:28.934
Just what have I done?

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:32.104
You're a rich man, Burdette.
Big ranch.

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:35.107
Pay a lot of people to do
what you want them to do.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.317
And you got a brother.

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:39.986
He's no good, but he's your brother.

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:44.241
If he committed 20 murders,
you'd try and see he didn't hang for them.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:45.951
I don't like that kind of talk.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.412
-You're accusing me--
-Let's get this straight.

01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:50.080
You don't like.

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.124
I don't like a lot of things.

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:55.627
I don't like your men sitting on the road
bottling up this town.

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:59.965
I don't like your men watching us,
trying to catch us with our backs turned.

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:03.301
And I don't like it
when a friend of mine offers to help...

01:02:03.469 --> 01:02:05.554
...and 20 minutes later he's dead!

01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:09.516
And I don't like you, Burdette,
because you set it up.

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:13.895
What're you gonna do about it?

01:02:15.606 --> 01:02:17.733
I thought you'd get around to that.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:20.902
I'm gonna sit here
with your brother in my lap...

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:23.822
...until the United States marshal
gets here.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.991
That'll be about six days.

01:02:26.367 --> 01:02:29.536
He may ask a few questions
about that busted wheel.

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:33.415
But I think you're too smart
to have stopped that stage completely.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.167
Now I'm running out of breath.

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:36.835
You talk if you want to.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.589
He talks awful big for a man
that's all alone...

01:02:41.048 --> 01:02:43.341
...except for a barfly and a cripple.

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:47.554
-You can get me out of here any--
-Shut up, Joe!

01:02:47.972 --> 01:02:50.766
You're not as smart as your brother, Joe.

01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:55.395
He sees Stumpy here sitting around
the corner locked in with you.

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:58.774
And if that isn't plain enough,
I'll tell you why.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.693
If any trouble starts around this jail...

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:05.822
...before anybody can get to you,
you're gonna get accidentally shot.

01:03:06.365 --> 01:03:08.700
I can practical guarantee that.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:12.788
I see you still have
a little grudge against us.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:17.709
Four hundred and sixty acres
might be little to you, Nathan.

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:20.045
But it was a lot of country to me.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:24.049
Don't take no chances, Nathan.
He looks just crazy enough to shoot me.

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.384
He's smarter than I thought.

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:30.222
You know,
a court might just call that murder too.

01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:32.682
Oh, hell, what's the difference?

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.851
We'd all be dead by then.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:37.354
You got anything else
you wanna say, Burdette?

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:41.233
Just one thing. Joe has friends.

01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:44.402
You can't hold Joe
or me responsible for them...

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:47.405
...what you say they've done
or what they might do.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:49.407
I want to make that clear.

01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:51.326
Well, I'll help you make it clear.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.120
I don't think
Joe's got a friend in the world.

01:03:54.288 --> 01:03:58.583
And he won't have any unless somebody
buys them for him at $50 a head.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.378
Like the fellow that shot Wheeler.

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:04.089
You made it clear.

01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:06.424
All right, Stumpy.

01:04:06.592 --> 01:04:08.426
-Nathan.
-Just sit tight, Joe.

01:04:08.594 --> 01:04:10.512
Send me a bottle before you leave town.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.224
You do that, because part of my job
is to see that it ain't poisoned.

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:17.185
Now sometimes it takes
quite a spell to find out.

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.568
-He didn't have much to say, did he?
-No.

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:32.951
What'd you leave him go for?
You had plenty to hold him on.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.536
Anything they're gonna do...

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.414
...is planned already,
or he wouldn't have come in here.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.917
Throwing him in with Joe would give him
an alibi for whatever happens.

01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:42.377
I never thought of that.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.796
-What do you think'll happen?
-I don't know.

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:46.965
You can think, can't you?
Any man can--

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:51.052
I think I told you to get back in there
and stay with that door locked.

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.680
Careful how you talk to me .
You hear what Joe said.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:57.142
You're alone except for a barfly
and an old cripple.

01:04:57.351 --> 01:05:01.313
Calling me an old cripple.
I like hearing you say that, Joe.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:04.316
I gotta fix your supper for you tonight.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:10.739
Señor Chance. Señor Chance.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.324
It's me, Carlos.

01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:13.825
Come on in.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.786
-What do you want?
-I wanna talk to you.

01:05:16.954 --> 01:05:18.371
Did the girl get...?

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:20.957
What happened to your eye?

01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:25.170
-You told me to put the lady on the stage.
-Oh, she did that? What did you do?

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:27.797
-She did not do it.
-I thought you said she did.

01:05:27.965 --> 01:05:31.927
I say, "You tell me to put her on the stage."
Consuelo, she hit me in the eye.

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:35.263
-Wait, I'm a little mixed up.
-Do not talk. I tell you.

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.223
-Go ahead.
-It is better if I tell you.

01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:40.894
You told me to put her on the stage.
The stage is ready, but she don't come.

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:43.521
I yell at her, "Come down."
She said she ain't coming.

01:05:43.689 --> 01:05:46.191
-I go and get her, she said she don't go.
-Did she go?

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.860
I tell her you say go.
I tell her I am responsible.

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:51.988
She say, no, she is responsible.
And I say, "That may be."

01:05:52.156 --> 01:05:55.533
I pick her up. Then Consuelo say,
"What are you doing with that woman?"

01:05:55.701 --> 01:05:59.037
I say, "I take her to the stage."
The woman said she don't want to go.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:00.747
-Did she go on the stage?
-Please.

01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:04.250
Consuelo tell me, "Put her down."
I said, "I am responsible."

01:06:04.418 --> 01:06:07.671
Consuelo thinks that mean something else.
So she give me this eye .

01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:10.090
-What did you do?
-"Do"? What can I do?

01:06:10.257 --> 01:06:11.591
My arms is full of the lady.

01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:16.054
I can do nothing. I drop her on the floor.
She yells. And she said I tried to kill her.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:17.722
Did the girl get on the stage?

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:20.558
No, she did not go!
But Jake say he couldn't wait.

01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:22.352
-Why?
-He say he must leave.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.021
I mean the girl.
Did she say why she wasn't going?

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:28.149
No. She didn't say.
How can I know if she don't say?

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:31.945
Please, Señor Chance. You come and tell
Consuelo what "responsible" means.

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:33.697
Stumpy, we're going out.

01:06:33.864 --> 01:06:36.908
Fine. I like to be left alone.
I'm getting used to it.

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:47.419
The door's unlocked.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:55.635
Well, I didn't go.

01:06:55.928 --> 01:06:57.387
I can see that.

01:06:59.473 --> 01:07:01.016
I don't know...

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:05.103
...I had everything all packed,
then Carlos yelled the stage was ready...

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:08.064
...and I heard somebody saying
they weren't going.

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:10.775
It was me saying it.

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:14.487
And you want to know why I didn't go,
don't you, sheriff?

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:19.075
What's your name, anyway?
I don't even know that.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:21.286
Chance, John T.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.705
"T" for trouble.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:26.624
I always make you mad, don't I, John T.?

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:30.712
Well, then, don't make me
tell you why I stayed.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:34.966
I won't make it any harder for you.

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:37.844
I won't get in your way. I'll just be here.

01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:40.722
You don't owe me a thing.

01:07:40.973 --> 01:07:43.349
And you won't owe me when it's all over.

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:46.978
When that happens,
just tell me to go, and I'll go.

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:51.816
No, you won't even have to tell me.

01:07:52.526 --> 01:07:54.819
I'll know by then, and I'll just go.

01:07:55.946 --> 01:07:57.739
Is that fair, John T.?

01:08:02.661 --> 01:08:05.663
You don't have to answer me now
if you don't want to.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:11.419
But just say something.

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:17.050
If I weren't in this mess,
it might be different.

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.510
But I am.

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.680
That's all I wanted to hear.

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.786
I'm glad we tried it a second time.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:47.788
It's better when two people do it.

01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:52.377
Well, I've kept you long enough.

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:55.380
You'd better run along now
and do your job.

01:10:57.836 --> 01:10:59.003
Hi, Chance .

01:10:59.171 --> 01:11:03.007
It's getting too dark to do any good
out there. I'd just be a sitting duck.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:05.760
Anything happen when Burdette left?

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.553
Nice as pie. Didn't say a word.

01:11:07.721 --> 01:11:09.514
What was the shot when they came in?

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:12.934
-That gunslinger of his was on the prod.
-What did he do?

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:16.020
Nothing, just grunted and growled,
made a few faces.

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:18.523
I took care of that.
What happened here?

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:19.899
Not much.

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:24.529
That tune, it's been playing it all day.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.072
What is it?

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:29.492
It's some Mexican piece.
I heard it farther south.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.704
Evening, sheriff.

01:11:32.871 --> 01:11:34.956
Colorado. What do you want?

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:36.958
Just curious again.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.043
How'd you come out with Burdette?

01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:41.087
He wanted to talk to his brother.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.548
-What'd he have to say?
-Nothing.

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.466
You mean he didn't say anything?

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:47.302
Why are you so interested?

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.470
Because he's talking now.

01:11:49.763 --> 01:11:51.222
Hear that music?

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.182
He told the man to play it.

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:55.393
What is it?

01:11:55.769 --> 01:11:58.521
They call it "The Deguello,"
"The Cutthroat Song."

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:00.815
The Mexicans played it
for those Texas boys...

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:03.318
...when they had them
bottled up in the Alamo.

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:06.237
Played it day and night till it was all over.

01:12:06.613 --> 01:12:08.740
Now do you know what he means by it?

01:12:08.907 --> 01:12:10.241
No quarter.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:14.579
-No mercy for the losers.
-You'll be hearing a lot of it.

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:17.248
I guess we made him talk after all.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:19.876
Just thought you'd like to know, sheriff.

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:20.353
Stumpy!

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:23.606
-What?
-They don't need any help with that tune.

01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:26.234
What's the matter,
is it getting through to you?

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:36.160
By the way, the stage got off all right.

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:40.415
I watched it clear through the valley.

01:13:42.209 --> 01:13:45.169
In about six days the marshal will get here.

01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:46.921
That's what I figured.

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:52.885
Oh, the girl wasn't on the stage.

01:13:55.347 --> 01:13:56.722
I know that.

01:13:59.017 --> 01:14:00.685
Tell her she could stay?

01:14:01.019 --> 01:14:02.270
No, she...

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:06.149
Yes, I did. What about it?

01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:08.025
Nothing, nothing at all.

01:14:08.193 --> 01:14:09.861
You were going to say something.

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:11.779
I remembered in time.

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:17.326
I remembered another girl came through
on a stage that stopped over.

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.872
I remember you told me she was no good.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.250
I didn't believe you, but you were right.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.711
So naturally I figured you're an expert.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:29.672
And you know just
what you're doing all the time.

01:14:30.924 --> 01:14:33.551
I just hope
you have better luck than I had.

01:14:36.054 --> 01:14:39.724
You know, that's the first time
I've been able to laugh about that.

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:41.559
Maybe there's some hope for me yet.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:42.727
Maybe.

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.228
But I doubt it.

01:14:44.396 --> 01:14:48.065
That's what I like about you,
you're such an encouraging man.

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:52.111
If you go by the hotel pick up
some coffee and sugar, would you?

01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:53.529
Joe complaining?

01:14:53.697 --> 01:14:55.364
Him? He don't get no sugar.

01:14:55.532 --> 01:14:57.909
His coffee's water poured
over the old grounds.

01:14:58.076 --> 01:15:00.036
I'll learn him to talk out of turn.

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:04.373
Before I forget, your gun's a little stiff.
You mind if I file the action a bit?

01:15:04.541 --> 01:15:06.751
I don't want you to file no action
on my gun.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:10.671
I don't want no easy pull. I might
shoot myself. Get somebody else's.

01:15:10.964 --> 01:15:13.174
Why don't you give him his own guns?

01:15:14.092 --> 01:15:17.136
-I forgot all about them.
-Your memory is no better than mine.

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.764
They been locked up over a year
except when you...

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:22.475
...took them out
to clean them and oil them.

01:15:30.275 --> 01:15:31.943
Where'd you get these?

01:15:32.444 --> 01:15:35.238
Bought them off the fellow
you sold them to.

01:15:38.283 --> 01:15:39.659
I didn't...

01:15:41.453 --> 01:15:43.120
I don't know how to....

01:15:43.997 --> 01:15:47.750
Let's take a turn around the town.
Get Stumpy his coffee .

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:50.169
Ain't you gonna tell me
to get back in there?

01:15:50.337 --> 01:15:53.089
No, stay out here and get shot.

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:55.508
I might do that just for spite .

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.677
Might get a laugh out of you.

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.846
What I put up with for $30 a month.

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:22.660
-Feels good.
-Come on.

01:16:23.161 --> 01:16:25.329
By the way, am I drawing pay?

01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:26.998
Same as before.

01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:29.834
In that case take out
what you gave for these guns.

01:16:30.002 --> 01:16:31.210
No hurry.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:34.422
If you're feeling so generous,
I could use an advance.

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:38.342
Buy a new pair of pants, new shirt.
Something without all these holes in it.

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:39.594
No need of that.

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.680
When you lit out,
you left some things behind.

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.308
I got them at the hotel.

01:16:46.059 --> 01:16:48.227
You been keeping them all this time?

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:51.355
Been waiting till they fit you again.

01:16:53.817 --> 01:16:56.902
You could use a bath and a shave too.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:17:00.698
I don't know about the shave.
I'm liable to cut my own throat.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:05.202
-Chance?
-Yeah?

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:06.704
They'll fit.

01:17:07.497 --> 01:17:08.706
Thanks.

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:41.197
There you are.

01:17:42.115 --> 01:17:43.658
Thank you.

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:51.832
How about you, John T.?
Shall I work on you?

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.043
I do my own shaving.

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:56.170
I thought you did.

01:17:56.546 --> 01:17:58.547
I was just reminding you.

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:07.348
Sure buy a lot of drinks with that.

01:18:10.143 --> 01:18:11.435
You sure could.

01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:16.315
I'll let you keep it for me.

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:21.737
Feathers, thanks for the shave.
Might call on you again.

01:18:21.905 --> 01:18:23.781
Anytime, because I'll be here.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:27.118
Oh, I didn't tell you, John T.,
Carlos is giving me a job.

01:18:27.285 --> 01:18:30.496
Good for Carlos. Shall we take Stumpy
his coffee and things?

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:33.457
You in a hurry, John T.?
I'd like to talk to you.

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:36.335
-I'll wait for you.
-Thanks, Dude.

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:39.463
-I just wanted to ask you--
-What's this about a job?

01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:43.509
Carlos says he's not sleeping very well.
Says I can help out downstairs.

01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:45.469
Tending bar?

01:18:45.637 --> 01:18:47.304
Among other things.

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:48.556
You...

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:51.308
-You think I shouldn't?
-Why ask me?

01:18:51.476 --> 01:18:53.310
The way you said "tending bar."

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:56.272
-All right, I won't do it.
-I didn't say not to.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.815
But you don't like the idea.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.609
Why should it be up to me?
Why should I care?

01:19:00.777 --> 01:19:02.778
I don't know why you get mad
when I ask you.

01:19:02.946 --> 01:19:04.572
-I'm not mad.
-You're not?

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.616
-You'd make anybody mad.
-I suppose I would.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:12.371
Well, as long as you haven't anything
against it, I'll take the job.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:13.581
Well, go ahead.

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:15.291
Thanks, I will.

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.461
What were you gonna ask me?

01:19:18.628 --> 01:19:22.006
-Never mind. You're in too bad a humor.
-What were you going to ask?

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:24.675
Whether you were gonna sleep
in the hotel tonight.

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:28.596
Get one thing straight. There'll be no more
chair-sitting outside this door.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:30.514
Oh, I know. I've given that up.

01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:34.477
Anyway, I have a better idea.
Tonight you sleep in my room.

01:19:34.644 --> 01:19:36.520
Anyone looking
wouldn't look there first.

01:19:36.688 --> 01:19:39.356
You'd have more time
if anything did happen.

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:43.402
Besides, I have a rocking chair,
it's more comfortable.

01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:47.198
Just an idea. You can think about it.

01:19:48.074 --> 01:19:50.367
When you're in a little better humor.

01:20:00.545 --> 01:20:02.296
Chance! Señor Chance!

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:04.381
The shot came from the jail.

01:20:15.435 --> 01:20:16.560
Chance, look out!

01:20:16.728 --> 01:20:17.937
Don't go in there.

01:20:18.396 --> 01:20:20.397
That idiot just took a shot at me.

01:20:21.399 --> 01:20:23.234
Stumpy! You all right?

01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:26.987
Sure I am, but there's a feller out there
with a black hat that ain't.

01:20:27.864 --> 01:20:29.281
And I'm that fellow.

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:33.202
Coming in.

01:20:34.746 --> 01:20:36.539
Look what he did to my hat.

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.168
Stumpy, that was Dude you shot at.

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:44.588
Dude? I didn't know.
Didn't look like Dude.

01:20:44.756 --> 01:20:47.716
-Fool almost blowed my head off.
-How'd I know it was you?

01:20:47.884 --> 01:20:50.261
You get yourself dolled up
like Astor's pet horse...

01:20:50.428 --> 01:20:53.681
...and then stick your nose in that door
and don't say nothing.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:54.849
Look at this hat.

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:57.810
If you hadn't ducked,
that's what your head would look like.

01:20:57.978 --> 01:21:00.104
I never would have fired
if I knew it was you.

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:02.773
Okay, I know.
Just stop talking, will you?

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:05.526
The shot didn't bother me.
I've been shot at before.

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:07.027
You could have hollered.

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:10.364
Just because you get cleaned up
don't mean you can't talk.

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:13.868
It's my fault. I should have yelled.
I shouldn't have taken a bath.

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:16.287
Just stop talking. Just let it be.

01:21:16.496 --> 01:21:19.915
You been going around for years
like something the cat dragged in...

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:22.585
-...and now you expect--
-Shut up!

01:21:24.754 --> 01:21:27.715
I told you, Stumpy, I've had it.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.634
Don't let me tell you again.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:49.820
You're getting a little touchy, aren't you?

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:53.032
I've been listening to
that old fool talk until I....

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:56.035
All right, I'm wrong.

01:21:56.202 --> 01:21:59.121
That old fool is talking
because he nearly killed you.

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:01.332
He's the one that's scared.

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:04.752
We've been pampering you too much.

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.630
You better get some sleep.

01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:20.351
You know, he acts like I done it
on purpose. And I didn't.

01:22:20.518 --> 01:22:22.227
You see that door there?

01:22:22.687 --> 01:22:24.855
That look like I done it on purpose?

01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:27.650
It's gonna get cold here at night.

01:22:27.817 --> 01:22:31.612
And I'm gonna leave it get cold.
Because I ain't gonna fix that door.

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:36.033
It wasn't my fault.

01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:39.119
Were it?

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.210
I know.

01:22:48.546 --> 01:22:49.922
I'll fix the door.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.230
Hi, sheriff.

01:23:15.448 --> 01:23:18.826
Well, how do you like your new job?

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:21.286
They've been keeping me pretty busy.

01:23:22.914 --> 01:23:25.457
You through for the day?
Going to bed?

01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:26.959
I thought I would.

01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:29.253
-Can I make you some coffee?
-No, thanks.

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:30.921
-Anything to eat?
-Nope.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:32.423
How about a drink?

01:23:33.758 --> 01:23:35.426
I'll take a drink.

01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:39.263
Carlos says this is for special guests.

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:42.307
Tired, aren't you, John T.?

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:45.519
I can fix you a nice hot bath.

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.354
All I want is that drink.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.859
Then this is all I can do for you?

01:23:53.945 --> 01:23:55.946
I thought you said I could think about it.

01:23:56.322 --> 01:23:59.575
You're right. I did.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.827
Put it on the tab.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:05.247
And in case you make up your mind,
I left my door open.

01:24:09.252 --> 01:24:10.544
Get a good night's sleep.

01:24:11.337 --> 01:24:13.338
You're not helping me any.

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:15.085
-Good morning, Dude.
-Good morning.

01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:16.670
Have a good night?

01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:18.422
All right, I guess.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.591
-Eat anything?
-Well, I--

01:26:20.758 --> 01:26:22.217
This morning?

01:26:22.802 --> 01:26:24.094
Stumpy fixed something.

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:27.139
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer it.

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:29.933
All right, I'll answer you.
I didn't sleep good...

01:26:30.101 --> 01:26:33.187
...didn't eat anything.
I had a beer and it didn't do any good.

01:26:33.354 --> 01:26:34.938
Think you can stand your watch?

01:26:35.106 --> 01:26:37.441
When I can't do that I'll let you know.

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:41.004
-That's enough.
-Yeah.

01:27:41.172 --> 01:27:42.798
Where's his hat?

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:52.474
Get out there.
We'll be along as soon as we get him tied.

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:07.364
Stumpy, did Dude have a bad night?

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:09.574
Oh, he's suffering thunderation, Chance.

01:28:09.742 --> 01:28:14.204
His mind's just beginning to work again,
and he sees what he done to himself.

01:28:14.914 --> 01:28:16.373
Well, ain't pretty.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.709
He's gotta sweat it out.

01:28:19.585 --> 01:28:21.920
And don't let him cry
on your shoulder either.

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:23.297
He ain't done it yet.

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:26.216
Why are you so goddarned ornery?
Always picking on Dude.

01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:29.553
-You got any tobacco?
-No, I give the last there was to Dude.

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:32.222
He used it up fast.
You gotta get some for yourself.

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:35.100
But what I'm asking you
is why are you picking on Dude?

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:39.187
All right, be nice to him
and he'll fall apart in small pieces.

01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:41.898
Maybe you're right.
You know him better than I do.

01:28:42.066 --> 01:28:45.819
I guess some folks is built that way.
But that wouldn't work with me.

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:48.613
You could at least have a kind word
for me now and then.

01:28:48.781 --> 01:28:50.949
Considering what I have to do around here.

01:28:51.117 --> 01:28:55.370
The sweeping, and the cooking, and
the nursemaiding that killer back there.

01:28:55.913 --> 01:28:58.165
Not even a "thank you" do I get.

01:28:58.374 --> 01:29:00.167
Maybe you're right, Stumpy.

01:29:01.085 --> 01:29:02.627
You're a treasure.

01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:04.254
Well...

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:07.841
-I don't know what I'd do without you.
-Yeah, well....

01:29:09.302 --> 01:29:12.804
Go back to being yourself.
Leastwise I'm used to that.

01:29:48.674 --> 01:29:50.425
He's coming down the street now.

01:29:55.014 --> 01:29:56.431
Good morning, sheriff.

01:29:57.016 --> 01:29:58.308
Colorado.

01:29:58.476 --> 01:30:01.311
I been hearing a lot of talk.
Thought you might be interested.

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:02.813
About what?

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.857
Mostly about you telling Burdette
what would happen to Joe...

01:30:06.025 --> 01:30:08.276
...if trouble started around the jail.

01:30:08.444 --> 01:30:11.822
Guess he didn't expect to hear that.
Kind of new to me too.

01:30:11.989 --> 01:30:14.324
-Would you have said it any different?
-No.

01:30:14.492 --> 01:30:17.994
He was doing to me what he's doing
to you, I'd tell him the same thing.

01:30:18.162 --> 01:30:20.705
He can't take a chance
on whether you'd do it or not.

01:30:20.957 --> 01:30:22.457
I don't suppose so.

01:30:22.625 --> 01:30:25.585
But you can be sure
he's gonna try it a different way.

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:27.587
Got enough left there for another?

01:30:27.755 --> 01:30:29.464
Sure. Help yourself.

01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:32.551
You always keep that carbine cocked?

01:30:32.718 --> 01:30:34.511
Only when I carry it.

01:30:35.346 --> 01:30:37.139
How come you carry a rifle?

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:41.226
I found some were faster than me
with a short gun.

01:30:45.857 --> 01:30:48.233
I don't suppose you have a match either?

01:30:48.526 --> 01:30:50.026
All out of them too.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.528
I'll get some.

01:31:01.038 --> 01:31:03.957
Sheriff, we ran into some trouble
on the road.

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.251
Al here is hurt. His horse threw him.

01:31:06.419 --> 01:31:08.712
Your deputy said we could find a doctor.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.464
Around the corner.

01:31:10.923 --> 01:31:12.966
About three or four doors to the right.

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:15.177
Stay away from that rifle , sheriff.

01:31:15.344 --> 01:31:17.304
You can see we've still got our guns.

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:19.556
That ain't your deputy up the street.

01:31:19.724 --> 01:31:21.224
Unloosen that belt.

01:31:24.937 --> 01:31:27.564
-What've you done to him?
-Don't worry about him.

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:29.566
Worry about yourself. He's all right.

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:32.903
He ain't gonna be and neither are you
unless you do as you're told.

01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:35.363
-Stay back here.
-We're going down to the jail.

01:31:35.781 --> 01:31:37.324
You'll turn Burdette loose...

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:40.869
...or you and your deputy are gonna
quit worrying about this whole thing.

01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:42.162
Take your choice.

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:44.414
Are you just gonna stand here?

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:47.417
If you wanna get him shot,
just go out there.

01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:49.419
What'll it be?

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:55.342
If you wanna do something,
when I get out on the porch...

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:58.094
...take that flowerpot and throw it
through the window.

01:31:58.262 --> 01:32:00.263
And duck after you throw it.

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:09.689
Just keep coming, mister.

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:12.359
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:32.170
Grab that horse.

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:42.472
-Colorado, where's he going?
-He's gonna see if Dude's all right.

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.737
Chance, over here.

01:33:04.954 --> 01:33:06.663
You look a little used.

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:08.999
What'd they do? I heard shooting.

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:12.502
They had me cold.
Gonna make me open the jail.

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:14.004
What happened?

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:17.090
I didn't have to. Colorado helped me.

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:20.010
If you'd have had him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

01:33:20.344 --> 01:33:22.220
I can get up by myself!

01:33:23.306 --> 01:33:24.681
I let them get me.

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:28.184
I let them walk right up
and stick my head in the water trough...

01:33:28.352 --> 01:33:30.312
...and it was easy for them.

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:35.317
I'm good when I'm sober.
Boy, real good.

01:33:36.694 --> 01:33:38.445
I should have known better.

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:42.198
A man ought to have sense enough
to know when he's no good no more.

01:33:42.366 --> 01:33:44.784
-Where're you going?
-Get your hands off of me .

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:46.328
I said, where're you going?

01:33:46.495 --> 01:33:49.372
You've got no use for a man
you can't depend on.

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:51.541
One bad night and I'm done for.

01:33:52.251 --> 01:33:55.545
An old man takes a potshot at me
and I'm finished.

01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:59.215
I tried and I tried hard,
and where did it get me?

01:33:59.383 --> 01:34:00.467
Look at me.

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:02.552
I got them so bad.

01:34:03.346 --> 01:34:05.722
What can a man do with hands like that?

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:11.186
-I'm through. I quit, John. I quit.
-All right, quit.

01:34:11.854 --> 01:34:13.521
Nobody's trying to stop you.

01:34:13.689 --> 01:34:15.565
If you wanna quit, quit.

01:34:15.733 --> 01:34:17.734
Go on back to the bottle, get drunk!

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:19.611
One thing, though.

01:34:19.779 --> 01:34:24.783
Somebody throws a dollar in a spittoon,
don't expect me to do something about it.

01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:27.327
Just get down on your knees
and go after it.

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:32.415
I'm sorry.

01:34:32.875 --> 01:34:35.085
"Sorry" don't get it done, Dude.

01:34:35.544 --> 01:34:39.673
That's the second time you hit me.
Don't ever do it again.

01:34:40.966 --> 01:34:42.425
Maybe you're right.

01:34:43.552 --> 01:34:45.762
Maybe you aren't much good anymore.

01:34:50.601 --> 01:34:52.268
Here are your guns.

01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:56.231
Fellow that took your hat
must have left this.

01:34:56.399 --> 01:34:58.233
You get something out of it.

01:34:59.276 --> 01:35:03.113
Now come on down to the jail, and
I'll give you the money you got coming.

01:35:09.578 --> 01:35:13.289
-I think this is your horse, señor.
-Yeah, that's mine. Thanks.

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:15.834
I guess Dude's all right.

01:35:16.001 --> 01:35:17.293
Anyway, he's walking.

01:35:17.461 --> 01:35:20.755
I'm so glad. I was afraid.

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:23.258
My stomach seems...

01:35:23.426 --> 01:35:25.677
Come on, maybe a drink'll help.

01:35:39.442 --> 01:35:41.943
Go on up to the jail and wait for me there.

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:46.072
Tell Stumpy to give you a drink.

01:35:51.662 --> 01:35:53.121
Oh, Señor Chance.

01:35:53.289 --> 01:35:56.291
What do you wish me to do
with this three dead men?

01:35:56.667 --> 01:35:59.002
You're the undertaker, Bert. Bury them.

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:03.006
There's another one down by the bridge.
Send in your bill and the county'll pay you.

01:36:03.174 --> 01:36:04.424
No need for that.

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:08.178
Each one of them had two new $50
gold pieces in his pocket.

01:36:08.345 --> 01:36:09.554
Price is going up.

01:36:09.722 --> 01:36:12.182
-What?
-Nothing, Bert.

01:36:12.475 --> 01:36:14.976
Bring their guns and other stuff to the jail.

01:36:15.144 --> 01:36:17.353
-It will be done.
-Here is your gun, señor.

01:36:18.022 --> 01:36:19.773
Thank you, Carlitos.

01:36:20.274 --> 01:36:21.441
Where's Colorado?

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:24.110
He's inside the hotel.
He took the girl, Feathers.

01:36:26.405 --> 01:36:28.531
Better give me another, Colorado.

01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:33.536
-Yes, ma'am.
-Look at me, Colorado. Take a good look.

01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:37.582
Would you say my head is soft?
Would you say I'm an idiot?

01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:39.375
No, ma'am.

01:36:39.835 --> 01:36:41.628
Yeah, well, you'd be a liar then.

01:36:43.047 --> 01:36:44.756
Better go easy on that stuff.

01:36:44.924 --> 01:36:47.091
-That makes three you've had.
-Yep.

01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:51.930
You'd be lying because that's what I am,
a softheaded idiot.

01:36:52.264 --> 01:36:55.892
There isn't any other explanation
for staying around here...

01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.937
...and inviting myself into this.
He told me--

01:37:03.067 --> 01:37:04.067
Hi, sheriff.

01:37:04.235 --> 01:37:06.945
We saw you coming back.
Dude was all right, wasn't he?

01:37:07.112 --> 01:37:10.406
He's all right. So am I , thanks to you.

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:15.078
-Thank the lady here.
-Sure, thank the lady. She did a big thing.

01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:19.249
She threw a flowerpot through the window
and helped get three men killed.

01:37:19.708 --> 01:37:21.251
Or was it four?

01:37:21.544 --> 01:37:22.961
Why'd you make me do it?

01:37:23.128 --> 01:37:25.922
-I made you do it?
-Sure, you did. Didn't he, Colorado?

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:28.216
He wasn't gonna do
what those men told him.

01:37:28.384 --> 01:37:29.551
Not him.

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:33.263
You were just gonna get yourself killed,
that's all.

01:37:33.764 --> 01:37:34.931
Somebody had to--

01:37:35.099 --> 01:37:36.724
What were you gonna do, sheriff?

01:37:36.892 --> 01:37:39.060
I'm glad I didn't have to
make up my mind.

01:37:39.228 --> 01:37:41.855
You weren't going down to that jail,
John T.

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:43.773
So somebody had to help you.

01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:46.568
But you don't want anybody to do that,
do you?

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:50.405
You're right, you didn't make me help you.

01:37:50.781 --> 01:37:52.490
It was my own idea.

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:55.785
It was my idea to stay.
You told me to get on that stage.

01:37:55.953 --> 01:37:57.120
I know you did.

01:37:57.663 --> 01:37:59.914
-I'm glad you didn't.
-What?

01:38:00.249 --> 01:38:01.791
I'm glad you didn't go.

01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:08.923
What'd you--? What'd you have to
say a thing like that for?

01:38:09.091 --> 01:38:13.761
You know, just when we get one thing
settled you have to go bring up another.

01:38:15.139 --> 01:38:17.640
You just don't make any sense, that's all.

01:38:17.808 --> 01:38:19.392
And neither do I .

01:38:19.685 --> 01:38:22.812
And neither do you, Colorado.
What're you doing in this?

01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:25.273
You don't have the excuse that I have.

01:38:30.446 --> 01:38:33.281
I better go before I make a fool of myself.

01:38:34.992 --> 01:38:38.328
I don't know why I should go though,
because we're all fools.

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:41.664
We ought to get along very well together,
all of us.

01:38:43.167 --> 01:38:44.834
Well, I'm going, anyway.

01:38:45.377 --> 01:38:47.837
We're just a bunch of idiots, that's all.

01:38:48.005 --> 01:38:50.381
Just a bunch of idiots.

01:38:52.343 --> 01:38:54.469
How did she get mixed up in this?

01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:56.804
She didn't feel too good.

01:38:56.972 --> 01:39:00.642
-She had a couple of drinks.
-I don't mean this. I mean out there.

01:39:00.809 --> 01:39:05.480
Oh, she was going outside to help you.
How, I don't know. And neither did she.

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:10.485
I told her to throw that flowerpot through
the window and I went out instead.

01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:13.279
And that's your reason
for throwing in with me?

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:15.615
She's right. It doesn't make any sense.

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:18.034
Wheeler just talked about helping me.

01:39:18.327 --> 01:39:20.161
But you saved my neck.

01:39:20.329 --> 01:39:22.705
Burdette isn't gonna kiss you for that.

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.374
So you're in.

01:39:25.376 --> 01:39:29.128
Now, don't tell me you didn't think
about that. Before you did it, I mean.

01:39:29.463 --> 01:39:32.256
If I'm gonna get shot at,
I might as well get paid for it.

01:39:32.424 --> 01:39:34.217
How do I get a badge?

01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:36.260
Come on, I'll get you one.

01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:40.348
Oh, I ought to tell you. Dude's quitting.

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:45.603
I'm sorry for that.
But I figure why is not my business.

01:39:46.355 --> 01:39:49.565
You've got peculiar ways of choosing
what is your business.

01:39:53.362 --> 01:39:57.532
You telling me they was gonna bring
Chance in here to make me turn Joe loose?

01:39:57.741 --> 01:39:59.117
Why, they're crazy.

01:39:59.284 --> 01:40:00.576
Goddarn fools.

01:40:00.744 --> 01:40:03.663
Chance brings in three strangers,
tells me to unlock the door...

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:07.417
...what do they think I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do.

01:40:07.876 --> 01:40:09.877
I'm gonna start blasting.

01:40:10.921 --> 01:40:12.422
Where'd you get that hat?

01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:15.550
-Chance gave it to me. For a souvenir.
-For a what?

01:40:15.718 --> 01:40:18.177
-Stumpy, we're coming in.
-Well, come ahead.

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:20.346
See, he ain't too proud to yell.

01:40:23.267 --> 01:40:26.269
Stumpy, where do you keep
the deputy sheriff badges?

01:40:26.437 --> 01:40:28.312
In the right-hand drawer there.

01:40:28.605 --> 01:40:31.024
You know where the book is,
the one with the oath?

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:34.694
No! If you can't take care of your own
truck don't look for me to do it.

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:37.613
We'll have to do without it.
Raise your right hand.

01:40:37.781 --> 01:40:40.950
Do you solemnly swear to take
on the duties of a sheriff's deputy--

01:40:41.118 --> 01:40:44.162
Found yourself another knothead
who don't know when he's well off?

01:40:44.329 --> 01:40:47.123
--in the county of Presidio
of the great state of Texas?

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:48.291
I do.

01:40:48.834 --> 01:40:51.377
And that includes taking orders from me.

01:40:51.795 --> 01:40:54.380
All right, sheriff.
How about giving me one?

01:40:54.548 --> 01:40:56.716
Get over at the hotel
and pick up your stuff.

01:40:56.884 --> 01:40:58.384
Move in here.

01:40:59.053 --> 01:41:00.720
What're you laughing about?

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:02.847
What I got myself in for.

01:41:04.475 --> 01:41:06.309
Cheerful about it anyways, ain't he?

01:41:06.477 --> 01:41:08.811
-How good do you think he is?
-He's all right.

01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:11.230
You think he's as good
as Wheeler said he was?

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:14.567
He threw me my gun and while it was
in the air, he got one of them.

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:17.278
-Then he got another one.
-Good enough. Good enough.

01:41:17.446 --> 01:41:19.238
Is he as good as I used to be?

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:24.118
It'd be pretty close.

01:41:24.286 --> 01:41:26.788
I'd hate to have to live on the difference .

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:32.919
Then you got the best of it. Him for me.

01:41:34.296 --> 01:41:36.297
What's he talking about? "Him for me"?

01:41:36.465 --> 01:41:39.092
Nobody never tells me
nothing around here.

01:41:39.259 --> 01:41:40.968
You heard him, he's quitting.

01:41:43.347 --> 01:41:44.847
What's got into you?

01:41:45.015 --> 01:41:47.558
Look at me. Ain't that pretty?

01:41:48.018 --> 01:41:49.644
Shaking worse all the time .

01:41:49.812 --> 01:41:52.730
What can a man do with hands like that?
Tell me, what?

01:41:52.898 --> 01:41:56.692
Take a drink! You said Chance told you to.
You did, didn't you, Chance?

01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:58.528
He can take the whole bottle.

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:00.446
Well, go ahead.

01:42:25.973 --> 01:42:27.056
Stumpy.

01:42:29.017 --> 01:42:30.184
Don't close it.

01:42:51.665 --> 01:42:53.166
Didn't spill a drop.

01:42:56.962 --> 01:42:58.546
Shakes are gone ...

01:42:59.256 --> 01:43:01.549
...just because of a piece of music.

01:43:03.635 --> 01:43:07.555
Till they played that piece,
I forgot how I got into this thing.

01:43:09.349 --> 01:43:12.560
Keep on playing it,
I don't think I'll ever forget again.

01:43:13.604 --> 01:43:17.023
Chance, give me another shot at it...

01:43:18.275 --> 01:43:20.318
...Stumpy can take the bottle away.

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:26.490
You heard him.

01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:33.289
Bring it out, put it back.
Nobody ever asks me if I need a drink.

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:36.000
I ain't gonna wait for them to ask me,
because I do.

01:43:36.168 --> 01:43:38.461
You two's enough to drive a man to it.

01:43:41.632 --> 01:43:43.883
I think I'll go watch the road again.

01:43:44.843 --> 01:43:47.136
Unless you need me for something else .

01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:50.514
Did you forget this?

01:43:52.142 --> 01:43:53.601
You could clean up a little.

01:43:53.769 --> 01:43:56.145
Yeah, you're a heck of a looking deputy.

01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:58.648
I'm better than I look.

01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:00.816
I'll do that tonight.

01:44:00.984 --> 01:44:04.987
If you think of it, send me some food.
I think I could eat something.

01:44:07.783 --> 01:44:09.742
Nothing in his stomach.

01:44:09.993 --> 01:44:11.953
Nothing but guts.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.956
You can quit worrying about him
and start thinking about me.

01:44:15.123 --> 01:44:17.875
We know about him.
He's gonna be all right, but I ain't.

01:44:18.043 --> 01:44:20.878
That got my goat.
I can't watch a man get down.

01:44:21.046 --> 01:44:22.171
Where're you going?

01:44:23.173 --> 01:44:25.758
To get Dude something to eat.
And you'd better--

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:27.927
I know, get back in my hole.

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:31.347
No, you'd better watch out for Colorado
when he comes back.

01:44:31.515 --> 01:44:34.308
I forgot to tell him
how trigger-happy you are.

01:44:34.559 --> 01:44:38.813
We get a good man, he has to watch you
to keep from getting shot full of holes.

01:44:38.981 --> 01:44:40.564
Close the window!

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:44.986
Still talking about that little accident
last night.

01:44:45.195 --> 01:44:47.863
Never can satisfy him.

01:44:51.368 --> 01:44:54.704
The sun is sinking in the West

01:44:55.539 --> 01:44:59.375
The cattle go down to the stream

01:45:00.377 --> 01:45:04.213
The red wing settles in her nest

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:10.303
It's time for her cowboy to dream

01:45:10.887 --> 01:45:13.347
Purple light

01:45:14.224 --> 01:45:16.642
In the canyon

01:45:17.311 --> 01:45:23.607
That's where I long to be

01:45:23.775 --> 01:45:29.822
With my sweet girl companion

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:35.786
Just my rifle, pony and me

01:45:36.246 --> 01:45:41.834
Gonna hang my sombrero

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:48.632
On the limb of a tree

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:54.263
Coming home, sweetheart darling

01:45:54.431 --> 01:45:59.977
Just my rifle, pony and me

01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:02.938
Whippoorwill

01:46:03.273 --> 01:46:04.940
In the willow

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:10.905
Sings a sweet melody

01:46:11.782 --> 01:46:13.616
Riding to

01:46:13.784 --> 01:46:15.117
Riding to

01:46:15.285 --> 01:46:17.203
Amarillo

01:46:17.371 --> 01:46:18.371
Amarillo

01:46:18.538 --> 01:46:24.085
Just my rifle, pony and me

01:46:24.252 --> 01:46:27.880
-No more cows
-No more cows

01:46:28.048 --> 01:46:30.758
-To be roping
-To be roping

01:46:30.926 --> 01:46:33.761
-No more strays
-No more strays

01:46:33.929 --> 01:46:36.347
-Will I see
-Will I see

01:46:36.515 --> 01:46:38.099
Round the bend

01:46:38.266 --> 01:46:39.433
Round the bend

01:46:39.601 --> 01:46:41.310
She'll be waiting

01:46:41.478 --> 01:46:43.062
She'll be waiting

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:49.068
-For my rifle, pony and me
-For my rifle, pony and me

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:54.657
-For my rifle, my pony
-For my rifle, my pony

01:46:54.825 --> 01:46:58.786
-And me
-And me

01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:01.956
That's real pretty.
Go on, play some more.

01:47:02.124 --> 01:47:04.875
Why don't you play something
I can sing with you?

01:47:04.876 --> 01:47:05.084
Why don't you play something
I can sing with you?

01:47:10.465 --> 01:47:12.425
I wish I was an apple

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:13.592
That's a good one.

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.095
Hanging in the tree

01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:18.848
And every time my sweetheart'd pass

01:47:19.015 --> 01:47:20.975
She'd take a bite of me

01:47:21.685 --> 01:47:23.894
She told me that she loved me

01:47:24.479 --> 01:47:26.939
She called me "sugar plum"

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:29.525
She threw her arms around me

01:47:29.693 --> 01:47:31.652
I thought my time had come

01:47:31.862 --> 01:47:34.363
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

01:47:34.656 --> 01:47:36.824
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.994
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

01:47:40.162 --> 01:47:42.455
I'll marry you sometime

01:47:43.874 --> 01:47:46.876
I wish I had a needle

01:47:47.043 --> 01:47:49.420
As fine as I could sew

01:47:49.588 --> 01:47:54.467
I'd sew her in my pocket
And down the road I go

01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:57.303
Cindy hug and kiss me

01:47:57.471 --> 01:48:00.014
She wrung her hands and cried

01:48:00.182 --> 01:48:04.643
She swore I was the prettiest thing
That ever lived or died

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:07.354
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

01:48:07.522 --> 01:48:10.065
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

01:48:10.233 --> 01:48:12.735
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

01:48:12.903 --> 01:48:19.909
I'll marry you sometime

01:48:21.578 --> 01:48:23.412
That's nice. Ain't it, Chance?

01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:26.457
It's better than being out
in the street and getting shot at.

01:48:26.625 --> 01:48:28.292
I can't argue with you.

01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:30.503
-You're right, Stumpy.
-Right about what?

01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:34.006
-I should have thought of it before.
-Thought about what?

01:48:34.174 --> 01:48:37.843
Burdette's shown his hand.
He isn't gonna rush this jail.

01:48:38.011 --> 01:48:40.221
Everything he's tried has been outside.

01:48:40.388 --> 01:48:42.681
We could sit here and wait for the marshal.

01:48:42.849 --> 01:48:44.433
Only be three or four days.

01:48:45.101 --> 01:48:47.603
How much food you got, Stumpy?
Enough for all of us?

01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:49.939
Yeah, if you can eat what I eat.

01:48:50.106 --> 01:48:52.191
-Water and firewood?
-Filled up this morning.

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:55.778
We do need some blankets and tobacco,
and matches.

01:48:55.946 --> 01:48:58.113
-Less you got plenty.
-He ain't.

01:48:58.448 --> 01:49:00.824
-And a few bottles of beer, Dude?
-Thanks, Stumpy.

01:49:00.992 --> 01:49:02.618
There's another thing now...

01:49:02.786 --> 01:49:06.956
...if we're all gonna be in here
three or four days, close together like...

01:49:07.123 --> 01:49:11.460
...it might be a good idea if a certain
party, not to mention no names was to...

01:49:11.628 --> 01:49:13.087
...do what he said he'd do.

01:49:13.255 --> 01:49:16.966
A horse barn's a good place but it ain't
a place for a fellow to roll around in.

01:49:17.133 --> 01:49:18.133
All right, Stumpy.

01:49:18.301 --> 01:49:22.096
Me, I like roses, but this fellow
ain't no rose this fellow I'm talking about.

01:49:22.264 --> 01:49:24.640
I'm gonna take a bath. I said I would.

01:49:24.808 --> 01:49:27.476
Dude, I never had no idea you wouldn't.

01:49:27.769 --> 01:49:29.520
I was just wondering when.

01:49:29.854 --> 01:49:32.314
He'll keep talking till we get out of here.

01:49:32.482 --> 01:49:34.942
I'll take a bath
while you gather up the stuff.

01:49:35.110 --> 01:49:38.779
Yell when you get back, because
you look different when you're clean.

01:49:42.284 --> 01:49:43.617
How do you do that?

01:49:43.785 --> 01:49:46.495
It's easy, Carlos.
You just weren't watching.

01:49:47.497 --> 01:49:48.872
Carlos, open up.

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:50.833
Coming. Coming.

01:49:52.502 --> 01:49:55.796
Buenos tardes, Señor Chance.
I think it is best to lock the door.

01:49:55.964 --> 01:50:00.175
Yeah. Carlos, I'm sleeping
over at the jail tonight. All of us are .

01:50:00.343 --> 01:50:03.846
We'll need some blankets,
plenty of tobacco, and matches.

01:50:04.347 --> 01:50:06.473
-And some beer too.
-You feeling better?

01:50:06.641 --> 01:50:07.683
Much better.

01:50:07.851 --> 01:50:09.852
-That's all you need?
-That's all.

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:14.189
When you get the stuff together,
let us know. I'll be upstairs.

01:50:18.862 --> 01:50:20.529
Now don't make any noise.

01:50:23.366 --> 01:50:24.700
Open your mouth.

01:50:50.393 --> 01:50:51.727
Hi, Feathers.

01:50:51.895 --> 01:50:54.146
Have you got any soap
that smells like roses?

01:50:54.314 --> 01:50:56.899
I have some soap,
but it doesn't smell like a rose.

01:50:57.067 --> 01:50:59.735
Won't do. Won't do. Stumpy likes roses.

01:51:00.570 --> 01:51:01.695
Who's Stumpy?

01:51:01.863 --> 01:51:03.322
The fellow that likes roses.

01:51:03.865 --> 01:51:05.616
No, he watches the jail.

01:51:05.909 --> 01:51:07.868
-Hurry it up.
-Right away.

01:51:08.036 --> 01:51:10.913
Yeah, what's all this
about moving down to the jail?

01:51:11.748 --> 01:51:14.750
Something I should have done
two or three days ago.

01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:16.585
Are you sorry you didn't?

01:51:18.088 --> 01:51:19.296
Are you?

01:51:19.964 --> 01:51:22.091
I know an easy way of telling you.

01:51:24.594 --> 01:51:26.679
Can't you talk plainer than that?

01:51:27.263 --> 01:51:28.847
Chance, give me a towel, will you?

01:51:29.015 --> 01:51:31.100
-I'm busy.
-What'd you say?

01:51:31.267 --> 01:51:32.893
Somebody's telling me something.

01:51:33.061 --> 01:51:35.854
I can't hear--
Give me a towel, will you?

01:51:38.191 --> 01:51:39.775
He's a big help.

01:51:40.026 --> 01:51:41.944
I'll finish telling you later.

01:51:43.405 --> 01:51:45.447
Purple light

01:51:50.537 --> 01:51:52.162
The Dude went in to take a bath.

01:51:52.330 --> 01:51:54.832
I couldn't see,
but I don't think he has his guns.

01:51:54.999 --> 01:51:58.293
The sheriff's upstairs talking to the girl.
He has his gun.

01:51:58.545 --> 01:52:00.379
I don't wanna go up and get him.

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:03.173
-Burdette wants him alive.
-Then don't talk so loud.

01:52:03.341 --> 01:52:06.552
He'll come charging here with that rifle
and we'll have to kill him.

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.971
-That might just work.
-What?

01:52:09.681 --> 01:52:11.306
The stairs are pretty dark.

01:52:11.474 --> 01:52:14.059
We stretch a rope across them.
Let him hear something.

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:17.479
Give me that piece of rope.
Come on, give me a hand.

01:52:32.662 --> 01:52:35.664
The sun is sinking in the West

01:52:35.832 --> 01:52:38.500
-Hurry it up, will you?
-Be right out.

01:52:41.212 --> 01:52:43.839
Well, if you're leaving,
I might as well get some sleep.

01:52:44.007 --> 01:52:46.842
I don't suppose I could come by
the jail once in awhile...

01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:50.971
-...and see if you needed anything.
-I don't want you anyplace around there.

01:52:51.347 --> 01:52:52.890
I was afraid of that.

01:52:53.725 --> 01:52:56.560
That means I won't see you
for three or four days.

01:52:57.312 --> 01:52:58.937
That's a long time, you know.

01:53:00.398 --> 01:53:01.690
You'll live through it.

01:53:03.526 --> 01:53:05.152
Yeah, you do the same.

01:53:16.748 --> 01:53:20.000
All ready. You both better get out there.
You too, Pedro.

01:53:20.335 --> 01:53:22.211
Leave the door open a little.

01:53:22.545 --> 01:53:24.463
Get the gag out of her mouth.

01:53:25.673 --> 01:53:28.634
Now, lady, we want you
to call the sheriff down here.

01:53:29.219 --> 01:53:31.136
No! No!

01:53:31.471 --> 01:53:32.638
Maybe this'll help.

01:53:33.431 --> 01:53:33.931
Please don't. Don't!

01:53:33.932 --> 01:53:36.683
Please don't. Don't!

01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:46.109
-He's out cold.
-Get upstairs, quick!

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.990
-Hold it, Dude.
-Watch him.

01:53:55.245 --> 01:53:56.870
Just keep coming, lady.

01:53:57.914 --> 01:53:59.998
All right, everybody downstairs.

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:10.926
All right, get on your feet.

01:54:18.017 --> 01:54:19.601
Come on, get up!

01:54:26.818 --> 01:54:28.068
Can you walk?

01:54:30.321 --> 01:54:32.698
-Where are we going?
-That's up to you.

01:54:33.199 --> 01:54:35.033
We go to the jail and you let Joe go.

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:37.619
Or we tuck you two away
and make a trade with Stumpy.

01:54:37.787 --> 01:54:38.871
Take your choice.

01:54:39.038 --> 01:54:40.956
You won't make any deal with Stumpy.

01:54:41.791 --> 01:54:44.877
-You'll just get Joe killed.
-Not if he knows we got you two.

01:54:45.044 --> 01:54:46.879
Chance, they got us. We're licked.

01:54:47.046 --> 01:54:50.632
Go on, take them over to the jail,
and tell Stumpy to open up and let Joe go.

01:54:50.842 --> 01:54:53.552
-Are you out of your mind?
-I'm telling you to do it now.

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:57.180
Stumpy couldn't hold out. He hasn't got
water or food and he's all alone.

01:54:57.348 --> 01:54:59.641
Nobody to get him any water.
Now go on, do it.

01:54:59.809 --> 01:55:01.685
-Do you know what you're saying?
-I do.

01:55:01.853 --> 01:55:04.688
I'm thinking good too.
Now do what I tell you.

01:55:06.232 --> 01:55:08.483
And then after they get Joe,
what happens?

01:55:08.651 --> 01:55:10.444
All we want is Joe.

01:55:13.323 --> 01:55:16.408
-You still think it's a good idea?
-I still think it's good.

01:55:19.245 --> 01:55:20.829
We'll go over to the jail.

01:55:20.997 --> 01:55:22.497
Take the shells out of his gun.

01:55:22.665 --> 01:55:24.041
I unloaded his pistol.

01:55:24.208 --> 01:55:26.543
Steve, you and Harry come along with me.

01:55:26.711 --> 01:55:30.505
Now look, sheriff,
we're going out of here natural-like.

01:55:30.673 --> 01:55:33.425
You carry your gun
and don't do anything to make anybody...

01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:35.218
...think something's wrong.

01:55:35.386 --> 01:55:39.139
If you have to explain to Stumpy,
tell him we put up bail for Joe.

01:55:39.682 --> 01:55:41.975
Burdette's got it figured out pretty good.

01:55:42.518 --> 01:55:46.146
If it was up to me,
you'd have never got up off the floor.

01:55:46.648 --> 01:55:49.274
Some of those you killed were
friends of mine.

01:55:49.484 --> 01:55:50.692
Give him his rifle.

01:55:54.072 --> 01:55:55.364
You first.

01:56:32.610 --> 01:56:33.860
Hold it.

01:56:34.696 --> 01:56:38.490
Yell to Stumpy you're coming in.
We've been watching you.

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:42.077
Stumpy, this is Chance.

01:56:42.245 --> 01:56:43.787
It took you long enough.

01:56:43.955 --> 01:56:46.039
Steve, cover from out here.

01:56:54.090 --> 01:56:57.259
All right, open up.
We're gonna let Joe go.

01:56:57.427 --> 01:56:59.177
How come?

01:56:59.470 --> 01:57:01.680
His friends here put up bail.

01:57:02.265 --> 01:57:04.683
Give me the keys then.
They're on your desk there.

01:57:06.269 --> 01:57:07.519
I forgot.

01:57:17.447 --> 01:57:18.530
Easy.

01:57:18.698 --> 01:57:21.742
-This fellow'll talk all right.
-Watch him. I'm going after Dude.

01:57:21.909 --> 01:57:24.244
You go along with him. I'll watch him.

01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:28.707
Now watch yourself.

01:57:28.875 --> 01:57:30.959
There's two of them holding Dude.

01:57:33.463 --> 01:57:34.838
The window.

01:57:46.559 --> 01:57:48.310
All right, Colorado.

01:57:56.569 --> 01:58:00.030
-In here, Señor Chance.
-They've gone.

01:58:00.198 --> 01:58:02.449
They took Dude
when they heard the shooting.

01:58:02.617 --> 01:58:05.869
They went out the back door.
They had horses. I heard them.

01:58:08.998 --> 01:58:10.665
They've gone all right.

01:58:12.001 --> 01:58:13.752
We gonna go after them?

01:58:15.046 --> 01:58:21.343
I told Nathan Burdette what'd happen
if he came after his brother.

01:58:21.511 --> 01:58:23.178
You ought to remember that.

01:58:23.346 --> 01:58:24.971
You thought it was funny.

01:58:25.139 --> 01:58:27.849
What do you think he'd do
if we went after Dude?

01:58:28.267 --> 01:58:29.559
I didn't think.

01:58:29.852 --> 01:58:32.020
Think the shoe's on the other foot now.

01:58:32.188 --> 01:58:34.898
The men who took Dude,
they were very angry.

01:58:35.191 --> 01:58:37.234
They say Dude set a trap for them.

01:58:37.401 --> 01:58:39.569
He sent them over there, all right.

01:58:39.862 --> 01:58:42.864
He knew what he was doing.
Knew what Stumpy would do too.

01:58:44.242 --> 01:58:46.201
That's why they're not happy about it.

01:58:46.369 --> 01:58:49.704
-What're you gonna do?
-It's what Burdette'll do.

01:58:50.665 --> 01:58:52.958
Carlos. Get ahold of Burdette.

01:58:53.709 --> 01:58:56.503
I don't care how.
Tell him I wanna talk to him.

01:58:56.671 --> 01:59:00.215
Tell him to set the time and the place.
But I wanna talk to him.

01:59:00.424 --> 01:59:02.384
We'll be at the jail.

01:59:07.807 --> 01:59:10.684
Aren't you sorry now
you didn't get on the stage?

01:59:16.190 --> 01:59:17.566
Come on, Colorado.

01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:20.026
Let's wake up the Chinaman again.

01:59:49.891 --> 01:59:52.100
Señor Chance. It's me, Carlos.

01:59:56.772 --> 01:59:58.607
What's the matter? What'd he say?

01:59:58.774 --> 02:00:00.567
He say he don't wanna talk to you.

02:00:00.735 --> 02:00:03.570
He say if you want Dude back,
he'll make a trade.

02:00:03.738 --> 02:00:05.780
-A trade?
-Dude for Joe.

02:00:05.948 --> 02:00:07.866
He'll be in his place over by the creek.

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:10.035
-The-- What you call--?
-Warehouse?

02:00:10.203 --> 02:00:12.287
He'll be there half an hour after sunup.

02:00:12.455 --> 02:00:15.999
He'll have Dude.
If you'll bring Joe, he'll be waiting.

02:00:16.167 --> 02:00:17.834
He said to let him know.

02:00:23.174 --> 02:00:24.633
Tell him we'll be there.

02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:27.219
Chance! You're crazy! You can't do that!

02:00:27.386 --> 02:00:30.555
-Not even if Dude was your own brother.
-What can I do?

02:00:30.723 --> 02:00:34.100
What we figured on doing.
Hole up till the marshal comes.

02:00:34.268 --> 02:00:37.020
When the marshal takes Joe,
what'll happen to Dude?

02:00:37.188 --> 02:00:40.065
Dude knew what he was in for
when he sent you over here.

02:00:40.233 --> 02:00:44.069
-I'd like to add my two cents worth, sheriff.
-Go ahead.

02:00:44.237 --> 02:00:46.780
From what I hear,
you and Dude are the only witnesses.

02:00:46.948 --> 02:00:49.241
Let's say we're the only ones
that'll talk.

02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:52.202
After Nathan gets Joe back,
he's still got to live here.

02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:56.331
Which means you two can't, and
if you don't have Joe, what'll stop him?

02:00:56.499 --> 02:00:57.832
The brakes'll be off then.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.335
That ought to be as plain
as the nose on your face.

02:01:00.503 --> 02:01:01.878
You're right, Colorado.

02:01:02.797 --> 02:01:04.881
But you and Stumpy didn't see the killing.

02:01:05.049 --> 02:01:07.008
I don't think he'll bother you two.

02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:08.802
-I'm not worried.
-Me neither.

02:01:08.970 --> 02:01:11.012
You'll just wait for the marshal to come .

02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:13.890
-He's still gonna want you and Dude.
-I'd say so.

02:01:14.058 --> 02:01:16.726
You can't get out of town
because he's got it bottled up.

02:01:16.894 --> 02:01:20.021
When you make the trade then
Burdette's gonna get the both of you.

02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:21.898
After a little argument.

02:01:22.066 --> 02:01:25.694
-But why at all? Why the both of you?
-Dude ought to have a chance.

02:01:25.861 --> 02:01:28.571
He won't get one the other way. Will he?

02:01:28.906 --> 02:01:30.156
Will he?

02:01:30.992 --> 02:01:32.867
You're gonna have me crying.

02:01:33.035 --> 02:01:37.872
Fellow's gotta be a drunk to get anywhere
around here. I might as well start now.

02:01:40.001 --> 02:01:41.376
Go ahead, Carlos.

02:01:57.476 --> 02:01:58.852
Well...

02:02:00.062 --> 02:02:01.396
Burdette's here.

02:02:04.317 --> 02:02:05.817
About time to go.

02:02:06.152 --> 02:02:08.737
How about I go ahead,
see if they'll play any tricks?

02:02:08.904 --> 02:02:10.071
Look out here.

02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:13.366
We're drawing quite a crowd.

02:02:13.576 --> 02:02:17.370
There won't be any tricks.
At least not till we make the trade.

02:02:17.538 --> 02:02:19.581
Besides, you're not going.

02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:22.917
When you decided to make the trade
for Dude, I went along with you.

02:02:23.085 --> 02:02:24.627
I'm going along now.

02:02:24.795 --> 02:02:26.046
Why?

02:02:26.881 --> 02:02:28.882
Let's just say I'd like a closer look.

02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:35.305
Up to now I thought you were smart.
Stumpy, you're not going.

02:02:35.473 --> 02:02:38.350
Why? Why ain't I going?
Give me one good reason why.

02:02:39.018 --> 02:02:40.143
I'll give you one.

02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:44.272
You've done a good job in here because
you haven't had to move around much.

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:47.859
But out there if anything happens,
you'll have to move, and move fast.

02:02:48.444 --> 02:02:50.779
I'd feel better if you weren't there.

02:02:51.614 --> 02:02:54.741
It's plain enough.
Old cripples ain't wanted.

02:02:55.576 --> 02:02:58.578
Well, you give me a reason.

02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:07.796
Now, do you want that I should bring
Joe out, or you wanna do that yourself?

02:03:08.130 --> 02:03:09.881
Bring him out.

02:03:17.139 --> 02:03:20.016
I think I'll take along a rifle,
some extra shells.

02:03:20.976 --> 02:03:22.394
Yeah.

02:03:29.318 --> 02:03:31.152
I told you I'd get out of here.

02:03:31.695 --> 02:03:35.031
Open your mouth again
and we'll carry you out.

02:03:35.991 --> 02:03:37.617
See you, Stumpy.

02:03:43.374 --> 02:03:44.582
See you.

02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:38.386
That's far enough, Joe.

02:04:43.726 --> 02:04:45.101
Through the barn.

02:04:57.239 --> 02:05:01.576
Just sit down over there
on those grain sacks.

02:05:24.934 --> 02:05:26.559
You want a closer look?

02:05:27.478 --> 02:05:29.270
This is close enough.

02:05:29.772 --> 02:05:32.941
Take that window.
Watch Joe.

02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:52.293
Burdette!

02:05:55.548 --> 02:05:56.881
Burdette!

02:05:57.299 --> 02:05:58.967
Nathan Burdette!

02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:07.350
We're ready. Joe's here.

02:06:07.810 --> 02:06:09.435
We're ready too.

02:06:10.521 --> 02:06:11.646
Start Dude .

02:06:12.606 --> 02:06:14.315
I'll start Joe.

02:06:14.483 --> 02:06:15.733
Go ahead.

02:06:19.989 --> 02:06:21.489
All right, Joe.

02:06:25.119 --> 02:06:27.453
You can start walking very slow.

02:06:29.164 --> 02:06:31.291
And stop if I say stop...

02:06:32.626 --> 02:06:33.918
...or I'll stop you.

02:06:35.004 --> 02:06:36.337
Bring him out.

02:06:41.302 --> 02:06:42.594
Go ahead.

02:06:43.345 --> 02:06:44.637
Slow.

02:07:26.388 --> 02:07:27.513
Look out!

02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:46.574
You want me to go help Dude?

02:07:46.742 --> 02:07:48.660
He'll take Joe all right.

02:07:50.537 --> 02:07:52.705
He's got a strange way of doing it.

02:07:53.582 --> 02:07:54.749
He'll take him.

02:08:00.464 --> 02:08:02.006
You're right. He did.

02:08:03.217 --> 02:08:06.260
Hey, Chance, I got Joe.

02:08:06.887 --> 02:08:08.596
He can't walk, but I can drag him.

02:08:08.764 --> 02:08:10.640
Stay right where you are.

02:08:10.891 --> 02:08:12.100
We'll throw you a gun.

02:08:12.267 --> 02:08:13.851
I'll do it. I'm closer.

02:08:25.447 --> 02:08:29.200
Wait till we start shooting, Dude,
then make a grab for it.

02:08:29.993 --> 02:08:32.203
Let's make a little noise, Colorado.

02:09:05.487 --> 02:09:07.155
That ought to start something.

02:09:08.115 --> 02:09:09.115
It will.

02:09:12.035 --> 02:09:13.327
On your left!

02:09:17.166 --> 02:09:18.916
Two of them made it to that shack.

02:09:19.168 --> 02:09:22.503
If they get across that creek, we'll be
in bad shape. They'll get behind us.

02:09:22.671 --> 02:09:24.964
I don't know how
we're gonna stop them from here.

02:09:30.971 --> 02:09:32.305
Is that who I think it is?

02:09:32.473 --> 02:09:33.681
Old Stumpy.

02:09:34.224 --> 02:09:35.933
The fellow I left behind.

02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:39.562
Hey, Señor Chance.
Don't shoot, it's me.

02:09:39.730 --> 02:09:41.647
Carlos, what are you doing here?

02:09:42.065 --> 02:09:44.692
I bring you some more shells.
You might need them, señor.

02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:46.360
Who'll turn up next?

02:09:46.528 --> 02:09:48.529
Maybe the girl with another flowerpot.

02:09:50.532 --> 02:09:54.285
Chance, Stumpy's sitting in a bad place.
That wagon's got dynamite in it.

02:09:55.370 --> 02:09:56.704
I go tell him, señor.

02:09:57.039 --> 02:10:00.792
You stay here. I'll go get him.
Give me those shells.

02:10:27.194 --> 02:10:29.403
Stumpy, get out of there.

02:10:29.905 --> 02:10:32.824
No. Come on, I got a front seat.
It's a good one.

02:10:32.991 --> 02:10:34.575
You got a good seat, all right.

02:10:34.743 --> 02:10:36.744
That's wagon's full of dynamite.

02:10:37.037 --> 02:10:38.746
Jumping Jehoshaphat.

02:10:39.164 --> 02:10:41.040
Why don't nobody never tell me nothing?

02:10:41.375 --> 02:10:44.919
Get away from that wagon
or you won't be around to hear anything.

02:11:02.604 --> 02:11:04.647
Stumpy, hurry up! What are you doing?

02:11:04.815 --> 02:11:07.400
What do you think I'm doing?
Taking a siesta?

02:11:08.861 --> 02:11:10.611
I brung us some dynamite.

02:11:11.196 --> 02:11:12.655
That's a good idea.

02:11:12.823 --> 02:11:15.199
Let's get farther away from that wagon.

02:11:19.121 --> 02:11:21.330
Can you shoot
as good as you say you can?

02:11:21.498 --> 02:11:23.916
-Can you throw?
-Near as far as you can shoot.

02:11:24.084 --> 02:11:26.210
We'll find out. Get that box open.

02:11:30.215 --> 02:11:31.465
Dude!

02:11:32.342 --> 02:11:33.467
Over here.

02:11:34.803 --> 02:11:35.887
Get ready.

02:11:36.054 --> 02:11:37.430
Let her go!

02:11:44.104 --> 02:11:45.605
That was a good one.

02:11:46.690 --> 02:11:48.190
Oh, stop cackling.

02:11:48.692 --> 02:11:50.860
Get one a little farther out there.

02:11:51.028 --> 02:11:52.528
There you go again!

02:11:53.322 --> 02:11:55.990
What would you do
if I wasn't throwing them for you?

02:11:56.158 --> 02:11:57.325
I'd throw them myself.

02:11:57.492 --> 02:11:59.911
Yeah, I guess you would at that.
You ready?

02:12:00.078 --> 02:12:01.412
Let her go.

02:12:06.543 --> 02:12:09.253
Hey, Dude, how do you like them apples?

02:12:09.421 --> 02:12:10.838
Hey, that's all right.

02:12:11.006 --> 02:12:12.131
Throw one for me.

02:12:12.674 --> 02:12:14.675
Go ahead, but throw it harder this time.

02:12:14.843 --> 02:12:17.094
There you go again.
You never can satisfy you.

02:12:17.262 --> 02:12:18.346
Throw it!

02:12:18.513 --> 02:12:20.014
Here you are, Dude.

02:12:26.104 --> 02:12:27.605
Took you two.

02:12:27.898 --> 02:12:29.607
I didn't allow for the wind.

02:12:29.775 --> 02:12:31.943
Can't you throw them any farther?

02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:34.362
I can if you wanna blow
the whole place down.

02:12:34.529 --> 02:12:37.406
That's the general idea. Throw it!

02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:48.167
Don't shoot. We've had enough.

02:12:48.543 --> 02:12:50.878
That got them.
That took the fight out of them.

02:12:51.046 --> 02:12:52.254
Look at them quit!

02:13:08.689 --> 02:13:10.398
Sure is quiet out there.

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:11.732
Did you find anything?

02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:15.903
There isn't a Burdette man left in town
outside of those who got locked up.

02:13:16.071 --> 02:13:18.698
Rest of them all cleared out.
We won't have any trouble.

02:13:18.865 --> 02:13:21.117
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

02:13:22.577 --> 02:13:24.203
What do you wanna do about them?

02:13:24.371 --> 02:13:26.914
Want to take them to Presidio
or wait for the marshal?

02:13:27.082 --> 02:13:29.709
-We'll wait for the marshal.
-Wait for the marshal?

02:13:29.876 --> 02:13:33.462
I'm glad you agree, since you have
to cook for them and watch them.

02:13:33.630 --> 02:13:36.632
That ain't the way I said it.
I said, "Wait for the marshal?"

02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:37.883
And that's a question.

02:13:38.051 --> 02:13:40.720
I'm fed up feeding them.
I ain't gonna watch them neither.

02:13:40.887 --> 02:13:43.848
I've been sitting back there so long
in the dark that I feel...

02:13:44.016 --> 02:13:46.475
...like a gopher or a burrowing owl
or something.

02:13:46.643 --> 02:13:49.270
When I went outside,
couldn't hardly see in the daylight.

02:13:49.438 --> 02:13:51.439
I'll watch them for you
if you wanna go out.

02:13:51.606 --> 02:13:53.107
-Would you?
-Sure.

02:13:53.275 --> 02:13:56.652
I guess it's dark enough I can go outside,
it wouldn't hurt my eyes none.

02:13:56.820 --> 02:13:57.987
I don't think it would.

02:13:58.447 --> 02:14:02.283
Maybe get myself slicked up a smidge and
have a drink, it wouldn't hurt me neither.

02:14:02.451 --> 02:14:04.035
I don't think it would.

02:14:04.953 --> 02:14:06.245
Well, should I go?

02:14:06.496 --> 02:14:07.538
Go ahead.

02:14:07.998 --> 02:14:09.123
Go ahead.

02:14:09.291 --> 02:14:11.208
-You ain't gonna give me an argument?
-No.

02:14:11.376 --> 02:14:13.127
Don't care whether I go or not.

02:14:25.807 --> 02:14:27.725
-Chance.
-Yeah?

02:14:27.893 --> 02:14:29.810
Have you seen that girl yet?

02:14:30.687 --> 02:14:32.980
I said, have you seen that girl yet?

02:14:33.732 --> 02:14:35.316
No, l....

02:14:35.817 --> 02:14:36.817
The job.

02:14:38.028 --> 02:14:39.403
Didn't have time.

02:14:40.238 --> 02:14:43.824
Well, the Fort Worth stage is in.
They run at night.

02:14:44.159 --> 02:14:45.493
Should be leaving soon.

02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.828
-You mean she's going on it?
-I don't know.

02:14:47.996 --> 02:14:49.914
I don't think you do either.

02:14:50.082 --> 02:14:51.999
But if it was me, I'd find out.

02:14:52.167 --> 02:14:54.585
I wouldn't walk around wondering about it.

02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:57.505
She might be leaving and she might not.

02:14:58.131 --> 02:15:00.216
She might need help making up her mind.

02:15:00.383 --> 02:15:01.926
But you're the expert.

02:15:02.094 --> 02:15:04.678
Me, I don't know anything about women.

02:15:05.388 --> 02:15:08.474
Next thing you'll be telling me
you don't remember one.

02:15:12.562 --> 02:15:14.063
Well, a man forgets.

02:15:15.357 --> 02:15:17.274
Sometimes--

02:15:18.527 --> 02:15:20.486
Sometimes it isn't easy.

02:15:22.531 --> 02:15:25.533
Something happens, he just forgets.

02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:30.412
In case you're interested, I have.

02:15:31.289 --> 02:15:32.706
I don't even want a drink.

02:15:34.126 --> 02:15:35.543
It's about time.

02:15:36.128 --> 02:15:38.546
I was getting awful tired
of taking care of you.

02:15:38.713 --> 02:15:41.882
If you wanna jump in, I'll take care of you.

02:15:42.884 --> 02:15:45.052
What is this now?
You're gonna take care of him.

02:15:45.220 --> 02:15:47.471
-Tell me about it.
-Sheriff's got himself a girl.

02:15:47.639 --> 02:15:48.681
Shut up.

02:15:48.849 --> 02:15:52.643
We ain't gonna go through that again?
You gonna do the same thing Dude done?

02:15:52.811 --> 02:15:55.896
-Keep still.
-Why don't somebody tell me these things?

02:15:56.064 --> 02:15:59.066
-Where you going? Where you going?
-Let him go, Stumpy.

02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:03.612
No fooling,
has the sheriff got himself a girl?

02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:05.990
I think so, but he doesn't know it yet.

02:16:06.283 --> 02:16:08.993
-She got him on the run?
-She sure has.

02:16:09.911 --> 02:16:11.328
I can just see him.

02:16:11.496 --> 02:16:13.414
Laying down the law to her.

02:16:13.582 --> 02:16:15.958
"I told you to get back in there!"

02:16:16.626 --> 02:16:19.420
And then getting told off hisself.

02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:28.095
Señor Chance.
Everything is all right?

02:16:28.263 --> 02:16:30.681
-I am so happy.
-Thank you, Consuelo.

02:16:30.849 --> 02:16:32.308
You look for the girl?

02:16:32.475 --> 02:16:33.767
She's in there.

02:16:34.602 --> 02:16:36.896
"No got time."

02:16:43.653 --> 02:16:45.029
Hi, John T.

02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:48.449
Just a second while I get my shoe tied.

02:16:50.911 --> 02:16:52.244
There.

02:16:54.289 --> 02:16:57.124
Well, it's all over, isn't it, John T.?

02:16:57.291 --> 02:16:58.791
Where'd you get those things?

02:17:00.003 --> 02:17:01.921
I wore them the last place I worked.

02:17:03.632 --> 02:17:06.133
Well, why are you wearing them now?

02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:08.260
Tonight's a big night.

02:17:08.428 --> 02:17:10.804
Consuelo thought
a little entertainment might help.

02:17:10.972 --> 02:17:12.138
I'm gonna do a song.

02:17:12.307 --> 02:17:14.475
You need a rig like that to sing?

02:17:14.976 --> 02:17:16.477
You haven't heard me sing.

02:17:16.645 --> 02:17:20.481
My legs aren't so bad.
Consuelo thought these tights might help.

02:17:21.650 --> 02:17:23.025
But you don't like them.

02:17:23.192 --> 02:17:26.320
-I didn't say that.
-You don't want me to wear them.

02:17:26.487 --> 02:17:27.947
I didn't say that either.

02:17:28.114 --> 02:17:31.950
-Is it because they show so much of me?
-They certainly do that.

02:17:33.995 --> 02:17:37.164
You're a stubborn, stubborn man, John T.

02:17:38.875 --> 02:17:41.168
Sometimes I know what you're thinking.

02:17:42.003 --> 02:17:43.671
And other times...

02:17:44.673 --> 02:17:47.841
You just can't make up
your mind about me, can you?

02:17:48.093 --> 02:17:49.510
You like what you see.

02:17:49.678 --> 02:17:52.596
You like kissing me.
You like what you touch.

02:17:53.264 --> 02:17:56.683
But you decided in the beginning
what kind of a girl I was.

02:17:57.727 --> 02:17:59.561
And I haven't helped much.

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:04.941
I wore these before I met you.
I wanted you to know it.

02:18:05.527 --> 02:18:08.070
To know what kind of a girl
you were getting.

02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:13.367
I wanted you to get that funny look
on your face and tell me not to wear them.

02:18:14.035 --> 02:18:15.536
But it didn't work.

02:18:16.204 --> 02:18:17.870
You didn't even get mad.

02:18:21.501 --> 02:18:24.420
I told you once
you wouldn't have to say anything.

02:18:25.088 --> 02:18:28.882
That I'd know, but I don't know.

02:18:30.050 --> 02:18:32.093
So you're gonna have to talk.

02:18:33.179 --> 02:18:36.056
I'm hard to get, John T.

02:18:36.224 --> 02:18:38.142
You're gonna have to say you want me.

02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:40.894
-Where you going?
-Downstairs.

02:18:41.062 --> 02:18:42.396
You better not.

02:18:43.106 --> 02:18:44.897
Why had I better not?

02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:46.483
Because I'm still sheriff.

02:18:46.651 --> 02:18:49.403
You wear those things in public,
I'll arrest you.

02:18:53.907 --> 02:18:55.284
John T.

02:18:57.662 --> 02:19:00.371
I've waited so long for you to say that.

02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:02.583
I thought you were never....

02:19:02.751 --> 02:19:04.918
You have the funniest way
of saying things.

02:19:05.085 --> 02:19:07.254
Just when I think
you're gonna say one thing--

02:19:07.422 --> 02:19:10.507
Get those darn things off.
I'll wait outside.

02:19:10.674 --> 02:19:13.843
No, you don't have to go.
I can use this screen.

02:19:14.596 --> 02:19:16.430
Besides I want you to stay here...

02:19:17.139 --> 02:19:19.641
...because the other thing is all over now,
isn't it?

02:19:19.808 --> 02:19:22.186
I'm trying to hurry, but I'm all thumbs.

02:19:22.771 --> 02:19:24.772
What I had to go through!

02:19:25.147 --> 02:19:28.609
Put on these tights,
ask a lot of questions...

02:19:28.777 --> 02:19:32.236
...start to walk out.
I thought you were never gonna say it.

02:19:32.405 --> 02:19:35.115
-Say what?
-That you loved me.

02:19:35.282 --> 02:19:37.075
I said I'd arrest you.

02:19:37.243 --> 02:19:40.954
It means the same thing, you know that.
You just won't say it.

02:19:41.331 --> 02:19:44.208
Oh, we're different.
I'll have to get used to you.

02:19:44.376 --> 02:19:46.459
Me, I just talk all the time.

02:19:46.628 --> 02:19:48.462
You most certainly do.

02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:51.340
You'll get used to that. You'll have to.

02:19:51.508 --> 02:19:53.884
Either that or start talking too.

02:19:56.137 --> 02:19:57.805
Tell me something.

02:19:58.139 --> 02:20:02.059
These tights, now why didn't you
want me to wear them?

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:05.687
Because I didn't want anybody
but me to see you in them.

02:20:05.855 --> 02:20:07.439
Oh, I like that.

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:09.817
You're getting better already.

02:20:09.984 --> 02:20:13.320
Shall I--? Shall I save them
and wear them just for you?

02:20:28.253 --> 02:20:32.256
-Do you think I'll ever get to be a sheriff?
-Not unless you mind your own business.

02:20:59.117 --> 02:21:01.118
