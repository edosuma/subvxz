00:06.632 --> 00:09.026
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:09.051 --> 00:11.272
When I pass the dagger
on to this Guardian,

00:11.297 --> 00:12.488
whoever it may be,

00:12.513 --> 00:14.446
the Darkness will finally rest.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.749
And I will be reunited with Belle.

00:16.851 --> 00:20.252
I wasn't the only one that
took a blood test that day.

00:20.361 --> 00:21.927
I am Lucy's father.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.756
Listen, I-I can still help you.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.258
Just use your dark magic,
whatever, get me out of here,

00:26.360 --> 00:27.496
and I'll kill any witch you like.

00:27.521 --> 00:29.027
You're a wild card.

00:29.052 --> 00:31.663
And I'm taking you out of the deck.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.794 --> 01:09.761
Can you hear me, Belle?

01:11.405 --> 01:13.939
It's me.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.755
I know it's only been a short time

01:15.780 --> 01:19.745
since I began my journey without you...

01:23.350 --> 01:26.585
but it feels like an eternity.

01:27.448 --> 01:29.421
I received a letter from Gideon.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.524
He's doing well in his studies.

01:32.626 --> 01:36.762
Our son misses you, Belle...

01:37.354 --> 01:38.764
terribly.

01:41.751 --> 01:43.445
And so do I.

01:45.479 --> 01:47.712
That's good.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.444
Quite good.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.047
Let it all out.

01:55.755 --> 01:57.550
After all, there's no greater pain

01:57.575 --> 02:01.553
than being separated from true love...

02:01.655 --> 02:04.022
Especially for an immortal like you,

02:04.116 --> 02:05.549
Dark One.

02:05.574 --> 02:09.394
I don't know who you
are or why you're here.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.430
But I suggest you go.

02:11.532 --> 02:15.283
The name's Facilier and I came to help.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.903
You see, anyone can come
here to talk to the dead.

02:18.005 --> 02:21.106
It's hearing them that's the trick.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.395
You came to ask Belle
if the girl you met,

02:24.561 --> 02:28.597
named Alice, is truly the Guardian.

02:29.309 --> 02:30.565
If you're really so interested

02:30.667 --> 02:32.367
in surrendering your power,

02:32.392 --> 02:34.859
perhaps I should take
it from you instead.

02:46.150 --> 02:50.719
You honestly think a pin
cushion is gonna work on me?

02:52.032 --> 02:53.555
Very well.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.690
Now I get the chance to do... this.

03:00.588 --> 03:03.665
If you truly can hear my wife,

03:03.767 --> 03:06.902
then tell me, what did she say?

03:07.823 --> 03:10.772
The Guardian has to be pure of heart.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.842
But the only way to
know is to test Alice.

03:14.356 --> 03:16.088
Belle says you have to hurry.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.012
Why?!

03:18.348 --> 03:21.383
Because she sees there's
still darkness in you,

03:22.005 --> 03:24.052
and she's afraid that without her,

03:24.927 --> 03:27.581
you'll succumb to it first.

03:40.696 --> 03:41.837
Don't worry, Belle.

03:41.939 --> 03:44.306
I'll find the Guardian in time.

03:44.408 --> 03:45.422
I promise.

03:45.447 --> 03:48.043
Oh, you better hope you do...

03:48.222 --> 03:49.888
because if you don't,

03:49.913 --> 03:53.281
I'll be there to pluck your
precious dagger from you.

03:55.475 --> 03:57.686
Good luck, Dark One.

04:01.631 --> 04:03.492
So what do we do when we
talk to this head case?

04:03.594 --> 04:05.260
Do we call him Nick or is it "Hansel"?

04:05.362 --> 04:06.428
Ah, it doesn't matter.

04:06.530 --> 04:08.096
All he's gonna be responding to soon

04:08.198 --> 04:10.190
is a number on the back
of an orange jumpsuit.

04:18.742 --> 04:19.741
Should we get help?

04:21.345 --> 04:23.945
I don't think we have to bother.

04:24.047 --> 04:25.407
What the hell happened?

04:26.200 --> 04:28.667
You think some kind
of medical condition?

04:32.648 --> 04:33.788
No.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.291
- There was someone here with him.
- How?

04:36.393 --> 04:37.425
The door was locked,

04:37.528 --> 04:39.160
and we're the only ones with a key card.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.899
Lock down the building.

04:45.377 --> 04:46.776
Now!

04:46.801 --> 04:48.534
Where the hell are you going?

05:23.206 --> 05:25.926
Hey, van Gogh. Whatcha drawing?

05:28.200 --> 05:29.945
Wow. Very lifelike.

05:30.047 --> 05:31.903
Uh, I don't know...

05:31.928 --> 05:33.648
Can't seem to get him right today.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.351
I woke up with this
terrible buzzing in my head.

05:36.453 --> 05:37.944
Do you hear it?

05:38.802 --> 05:40.542
I don't think so.

05:40.615 --> 05:43.792
Great. Must be me, then.

05:44.089 --> 05:45.502
You know what I think?

05:45.527 --> 05:46.661
You need to get out of
your head a little bit.

05:46.730 --> 05:48.415
It's good for the soul.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.686
And just so happens that I
know the perfect way to do it.

05:51.711 --> 05:53.111
Oh, yeah?

05:53.136 --> 05:56.110
You are spending the day with me.

05:56.135 --> 05:58.253
We're gonna do some
eating, some walking,

05:58.278 --> 05:59.343
maybe some more eating.

05:59.368 --> 06:00.534
I'm a big fan of food.

06:04.128 --> 06:05.878
So, it's...

06:06.557 --> 06:07.626
like a date?

06:08.582 --> 06:10.181
I hope so,

06:10.206 --> 06:12.408
or else I'm wasting a whole
lot of lip gloss right now.

06:14.350 --> 06:15.737
So, what do you say?

06:15.810 --> 06:17.610
Can you take a break from Mr. Sad Troll?

06:19.503 --> 06:20.962
Yeah, why not?

06:24.969 --> 06:27.410
I'm just so happy you didn't get hurt.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.297
How did I make such a mistake with Nick?

06:31.352 --> 06:34.484
You can't blame yourself, okay?

06:35.648 --> 06:38.415
Nobody realized he was crazy.

06:38.670 --> 06:40.946
Y-You still haven't told me much

06:40.971 --> 06:42.770
about what he said to you.

06:43.391 --> 06:45.591
Maybe talking about it would help.

06:48.416 --> 06:49.266
Yeah.

06:49.291 --> 06:55.817
Um, thank you, but to be honest, I...

06:56.977 --> 06:59.121
I just don't think I'm ready yet.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.103
Weaver, what the hell's going on?

07:09.128 --> 07:11.028
I have a hunch who killed our suspect.

07:11.079 --> 07:12.751
This one I intend to follow up on.

07:12.776 --> 07:15.010
So I guess I'll take care of all
the actual, bloody police work, then.

07:15.158 --> 07:16.157
Well, you go ahead.

07:16.283 --> 07:18.586
Pull surveillance
footage, dust for prints,

07:18.688 --> 07:21.256
follow whatever part
of "the book" you like.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.811
Just don't get in my way.

07:22.836 --> 07:25.397
What the hell's gotten into you?
I've never seen you like this.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.546
Like what?

07:27.571 --> 07:28.637
Scared.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.076
Oh! Robin.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.373
Alice.

07:51.398 --> 07:52.446
Sorry to keep you waiting.

07:52.548 --> 07:53.981
Here, one letter from your dad.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.305
Oh.

07:57.653 --> 08:01.450
And I also brought you this.

08:02.020 --> 08:04.292
Oh, it's beautiful.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.205
Everyone back home in
Storybrooke makes them,

08:06.230 --> 08:07.462
and when you're finished,

08:07.487 --> 08:09.620
you're supposed to find
someone to swap with.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.689
Oh.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.721
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna
be terribly disappointed,

08:13.746 --> 08:16.821
because I don't have
anything for you in return.

08:16.846 --> 08:19.330
Oh... Oh! No! Wait.

08:20.394 --> 08:22.027
I do have this.

08:22.948 --> 08:25.570
It's from one of my
adventures in Wonderland.

08:25.885 --> 08:27.017
That's amazing.

08:27.042 --> 08:29.908
I've never seen a watch
that moves backwards.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.344
I wish I'd done as many
exciting things as you.

08:33.369 --> 08:36.202
Yeah, well, as much fun
as traveling realms is,

08:36.227 --> 08:38.349
I'm starting to learn you can
have a lot of other adventures

08:38.418 --> 08:41.813
just staying put... good ones, too.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.747
Well, I should get going.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.731
Your dad will be wondering how you are.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.330
I'll see you soon, Alice.

08:50.355 --> 08:52.989
Yeah. I hope so.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.087
I think Alice has had
enough visitors for one day.

09:08.190 --> 09:09.309
See, I don't care

09:09.334 --> 09:11.467
that everybody thinks
that you're a hero now,

09:11.718 --> 09:13.551
including my less-dashing other self,

09:13.620 --> 09:15.987
because I know the truth
of who you are, Crocodile.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.789
Lower the blade, pirate.

09:17.858 --> 09:18.990
I'm here to help.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.798
You want to help her?

09:21.415 --> 09:24.784
Heal my heart so my daughter
and I can be together again.

09:24.809 --> 09:25.708
I can't.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.232
Gothel used dark magic to curse you,

09:27.300 --> 09:30.202
which means any solution
would be just as dark.

09:30.227 --> 09:31.882
No loophole can get around that.

09:31.907 --> 09:33.004
So what use are you to her at all?

09:33.719 --> 09:35.018
And why are you bloody here?

09:35.043 --> 09:37.077
I came to test Alice.

09:37.102 --> 09:39.410
I believe she's destined
to become a great hero,

09:39.435 --> 09:40.921
a protector

09:40.946 --> 09:44.581
of the Dark One dagger
known as The Guardian.

09:45.984 --> 09:47.872
So, that's what this is all about.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.622
You've grown tired
of your bloody dagger,

09:50.690 --> 09:53.391
realizing that immortality
isn't all it's cracked up to be,

09:53.460 --> 09:55.860
but I don't care because
it'll be a cold day in Hell

09:55.962 --> 09:57.495
when I let you saddle
my daughter with it

09:57.597 --> 09:58.963
so she can take your place.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.465
This isn't just about me.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.767
Don't you think Alice should
have a say in all of this?

10:02.836 --> 10:06.037
So you can manipulate her? No.

10:06.216 --> 10:07.616
You saw her with Robin.

10:07.641 --> 10:08.640
She's happy.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.464
She finally has a
chance at a normal life.

10:11.596 --> 10:13.648
And I won't let anyone,
including the Dark One,

10:13.778 --> 10:15.177
threaten to take that away from her.

10:15.202 --> 10:17.703
Now, if you know what's good for you...

10:18.329 --> 10:20.329
you'll go.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.823
Something wrong with the TV?

10:33.891 --> 10:35.084
It's not the TV.

10:35.109 --> 10:37.576
It's the hard drive for the
precinct's security system.

10:37.733 --> 10:39.816
An electrical surge wiped it clean

10:39.848 --> 10:42.749
the same time as our
serial killer's death.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.017
Wow, that's...

10:44.343 --> 10:46.276
that's some really bad timing.

10:47.499 --> 10:49.699
Found these on the
printer... They yours?

10:50.535 --> 10:52.602
Yeah. Thanks, Sam.

10:53.727 --> 10:55.265
I did some digging,

10:55.290 --> 10:58.131
and the bank's cameras across
the street were unaffected.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.633
These are the stills
from the same time period.

11:00.930 --> 11:02.130
Smart thinking.

11:04.524 --> 11:06.072
Well, good luck.

11:09.509 --> 11:11.164
Hey. Rogers.

11:11.189 --> 11:12.779
Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.

11:12.881 --> 11:13.780
Henry.

11:13.849 --> 11:15.014
I'm in the thick of it,

11:15.117 --> 11:17.275
but I always have time
for my unofficial deputy.

11:17.384 --> 11:18.483
How are you holding up?

11:18.540 --> 11:21.216
To be honest, uh, not great.

11:21.241 --> 11:24.842
You see, some of what Nick said to me,

11:25.506 --> 11:27.817
it's kind of made me
question some things.

11:27.842 --> 11:30.895
It's like I'm not sure what's real.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.637
Don't doubt yourself, mate.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.902
Nick was the crazy one, not you.

11:34.986 --> 11:35.715
I know you're right,

11:35.740 --> 11:37.854
and... and I know that
what I'm about to ask

11:37.879 --> 11:39.590
probably breaks like a thousand rules,

11:39.615 --> 11:43.949
but I was hoping that maybe
you'd let me talk to him.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.965
Even if I wanted to, Henry, I couldn't.

11:49.637 --> 11:51.504
I'm afraid Nick's dead.

11:52.399 --> 11:53.957
What?

11:54.993 --> 11:57.290
D-Do you know what happened to him?

11:57.525 --> 11:58.982
Not yet.

11:59.007 --> 12:01.641
But I may have found some leads.

12:02.100 --> 12:05.670
And hopefully, I'll find
some more in Nick's apartment.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.889
Uh, if... if you're going
there, take me with you.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.030
There is something that
Nick showed me there.

12:11.055 --> 12:13.493
If I can see it again, it
might help explain things.

12:13.524 --> 12:14.555
I'm sorry, mate.

12:14.580 --> 12:17.032
- You want to take about breaking rules...
- Please.

12:17.057 --> 12:18.579
You know that you never
would've caught this guy

12:18.604 --> 12:20.086
if it wasn't for me.

12:21.461 --> 12:23.474
I'm telling you... I need this.

12:25.552 --> 12:26.745
Fine.

12:26.770 --> 12:28.770
Thank you.

12:35.569 --> 12:37.369
Impressive-looking magic.

12:37.681 --> 12:39.671
Would you mind if I
asked where it came from?

12:39.696 --> 12:41.550
Weaver. Don't you knock?

12:41.618 --> 12:42.944
I don't have time for pleasantries.

12:42.969 --> 12:44.902
Just answer the question...
Where did it come from?

12:46.059 --> 12:49.001
Samdi gave it to me to help heal Henry.

12:49.026 --> 12:50.525
And I'm close.

12:50.594 --> 12:53.628
Why? What's gotten into you?

12:53.697 --> 12:55.797
Well, maybe you should
ask your boyfriend,

12:55.866 --> 12:58.658
considering he kept some
of that for himself...

12:59.182 --> 13:01.036
Then used it to kill Hansel

13:01.138 --> 13:03.605
before stealing the Dark One Dagger.

13:03.707 --> 13:05.006
No.

13:05.572 --> 13:09.018
If you want to keep fooling
yourself, be my guest.

13:09.143 --> 13:10.545
But he doesn't care about you...

13:11.175 --> 13:12.208
Never did.

13:12.233 --> 13:13.949
He just used you so he
could get close enough

13:14.051 --> 13:16.497
to get what he really wanted from me.

13:16.522 --> 13:19.020
- Get the hell out of here.
- No, no, no, not until I take something

13:19.122 --> 13:20.488
to level the playing field.

13:20.591 --> 13:21.656
No.

13:21.758 --> 13:23.325
This is the only hope of healing Henry,

13:23.427 --> 13:24.593
and you're not touching it.

13:24.655 --> 13:28.205
Your desperate little
family reunion can wait.

13:28.230 --> 13:30.542
Your son's been fine long
enough without your hugs.

13:30.567 --> 13:31.499
He'll survive.

13:31.568 --> 13:33.368
You mean your grandson?

13:34.597 --> 13:38.940
Look, I know Belle's
death has been hard on you,

13:39.321 --> 13:41.391
and I know you're yearning
to get back to her.

13:41.416 --> 13:43.285
But this isn't the way.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.310
Trust me.

13:47.095 --> 13:49.093
Let me speak to Samdi.

13:49.118 --> 13:51.653
I'll get to the bottom of this.

13:51.817 --> 13:55.886
Until then, don't do anything crazy.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.328
This is the most delicious
thing I've ever eaten.

14:08.397 --> 14:10.247
I had no idea you could candy on fruit.

14:10.272 --> 14:12.806
You can put candy on anything
if you try hard enough.

14:12.938 --> 14:14.070
It's a worthy goal.

14:14.741 --> 14:15.974
So, what's next?

14:16.239 --> 14:18.000
Actually, that's up to you.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.707
I showed you a little taste
of my Hyperion Heights.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.442
Show me something about yours.

14:24.150 --> 14:25.512
I know just the place.

14:31.710 --> 14:32.730
Huh.

14:32.755 --> 14:35.022
Mom-and-pop bookshop...
Excellent choice.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.823
Actually, it's pop-and-pop...

14:36.892 --> 14:39.526
And this isn't even the best part.

14:46.372 --> 14:48.849
This is one of my favorite
spots in the whole city.

14:49.365 --> 14:50.271
Why's that?

14:50.339 --> 14:52.039
Because from here you can
go anywhere in the world

14:52.108 --> 14:53.115
without ever taking a step.

14:53.638 --> 14:55.004
See?

14:55.404 --> 14:56.110
Huh.

14:56.178 --> 14:59.113
The is the best description of
a bookshelf I have ever heard.

14:59.215 --> 15:01.315
Yeah, well, when your world is small,

15:01.417 --> 15:03.817
you do anything you
can to make it bigger.

15:04.628 --> 15:05.775
Probably sounds crazy

15:05.800 --> 15:07.675
to someone who's actually seen things.

15:08.096 --> 15:09.509
Not at all.

15:10.244 --> 15:12.440
Let me tell you, there were lots of days

15:12.537 --> 15:13.569
when traveling like this

15:13.594 --> 15:15.160
would've been a hell of a lot easier...

15:15.306 --> 15:17.340
Like any time I took a bus.

15:17.365 --> 15:19.232
They almost always broke
down on the side of the road

15:19.344 --> 15:22.044
in some tiny, little town,
usually while it was raining.

15:22.113 --> 15:23.379
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:23.448 --> 15:24.598
It happened so many times,

15:24.623 --> 15:26.957
I started picking up
these little souvenirs.

15:27.151 --> 15:28.815
I got this one in Thailand.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.637
Ooh!

15:29.662 --> 15:32.817
This one I got at this
amazing little village in Peru.

15:33.246 --> 15:34.690
This one's my favorite.

15:35.326 --> 15:36.859
I got this one in the farthest place

15:36.884 --> 15:38.617
from Hyperion Heights you can go

15:38.642 --> 15:39.729
before you start coming back.

15:39.831 --> 15:40.930
Mm.

15:41.225 --> 15:43.543
Wonder if I'll ever have
an adventure like that.

15:43.568 --> 15:44.801
Oh, you will.

15:44.871 --> 15:46.571
I can tell these things.

15:46.705 --> 15:49.172
You are gonna have lots of adventures.

15:52.464 --> 15:54.358
What do you think, Mr. Rabbit?

15:55.351 --> 15:56.882
Do you like my bracelet?

15:58.132 --> 15:59.783
Robin gave it to me,

16:00.506 --> 16:03.174
and I don't plan to ever take it off.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.140
Alice.

16:08.209 --> 16:09.375
Rumplestiltskin?

16:09.443 --> 16:11.317
I'm glad you're still awake.

16:11.342 --> 16:13.679
I am, but you shouldn't be here.

16:13.748 --> 16:15.948
I know we're friends... Or
at least we used to be...

16:16.050 --> 16:17.916
But my papa wrote me a letter.

16:17.985 --> 16:19.048
And he didn't say why,

16:19.073 --> 16:20.786
but he warned me not to talk to you.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.655
I know. Uh, that's why I waited

16:22.757 --> 16:25.224
for a time he wasn't
watching to come see you.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.280
W-What happened to your hand?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.591
It's nothing.

16:33.616 --> 16:35.067
What's important is you're right...

16:35.417 --> 16:36.916
We are friends.

16:37.522 --> 16:40.015
Which means if you
want me to go, I will.

16:40.574 --> 16:41.648
I was simply hoping

16:41.673 --> 16:44.107
to see you and your
father reunited again.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.005
Wait.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.910
Do you really have a
way to cure his heart?

16:52.978 --> 16:55.145
Yes, I do.

16:55.247 --> 16:57.114
You see, your father

16:57.176 --> 16:59.610
thought the path was too dangerous,

16:59.756 --> 17:01.393
but I know how painful it is

17:01.418 --> 17:03.452
to be separated from
the person you love.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.955
And I thought you should
have the opportunity

17:05.981 --> 17:07.313
to decide for yourself.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.095
I'm glad you came.

17:11.594 --> 17:13.328
So where do we find this cure?

17:13.353 --> 17:14.375
Well, it's in the possession

17:14.400 --> 17:17.406
of a very powerful witch
doctor named Facilier.

17:18.242 --> 17:19.665
And I have to warn you

17:19.690 --> 17:22.223
he won't give up that
magic without a fight.

17:22.548 --> 17:25.242
But I have a plan.

17:26.040 --> 17:29.254
Good, 'cause I'll do whatever it takes.

17:29.454 --> 17:31.106
Now, where's my cloak?

17:38.641 --> 17:40.074
Yes.

17:40.099 --> 17:41.799
I killed Nick.

17:43.311 --> 17:44.543
But surely...

17:45.314 --> 17:46.634
you're not going to shed tears

17:46.659 --> 17:49.927
over the untimely death of
a serial killer, are you?

17:50.386 --> 17:52.587
How I'm feeling isn't the issue.

17:55.725 --> 17:58.059
I'm here about the dagger.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.687
What about it?

17:59.712 --> 18:01.279
It's missing.

18:01.564 --> 18:03.731
And I need to know if you took it.

18:03.833 --> 18:04.966
And if you did,

18:05.034 --> 18:07.535
I'm just asking you to return it.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.027
This is about more than...

18:10.543 --> 18:12.340
whatever we have between us.

18:14.762 --> 18:16.978
I know exactly what it's about.

18:17.192 --> 18:19.080
Or rather who it's about.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.181
The Dark One.

18:20.660 --> 18:21.859
Have you noticed

18:21.884 --> 18:25.319
it's always him slithering
between you and me?

18:25.892 --> 18:27.622
Have you asked yourself why that is?

18:27.892 --> 18:30.558
Do you have his dagger or not?

18:30.900 --> 18:31.970
I was clear

18:32.506 --> 18:34.372
that when I came back to the Heights,

18:34.397 --> 18:35.963
it was to get that dagger.

18:36.065 --> 18:40.163
Don't make me ask you a third time.

18:40.890 --> 18:42.271
All right.

18:42.296 --> 18:44.647
Then the truth is I don't have it.

18:45.297 --> 18:47.213
Now, you can decide
to believe me or not.

18:47.245 --> 18:48.911
The choice is yours.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.629
Thank you. I do believe you.

19:01.965 --> 19:03.598
I should go.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.334
Will I see you later?

19:13.402 --> 19:14.974
Maybe.

19:32.996 --> 19:34.795
Hello, Dark One.

19:35.562 --> 19:37.080
If you've been here,

19:37.105 --> 19:38.992
then you know I don't have
what you're looking for.

19:39.017 --> 19:41.684
Well, Roni may believe you, but me?

19:42.303 --> 19:43.735
I know better.

19:45.144 --> 19:47.578
I'd say it's time we had a little chat.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.688
Hello?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.867
Dragon's Fire.

20:37.501 --> 20:40.704
One drop burns the
fingernails right off.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.573
Interested?

20:42.675 --> 20:43.771
No, thanks.

20:43.796 --> 20:47.744
Uh, I was actually hoping
to speak to some dead.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.303
I heard you could do that.

20:49.328 --> 20:52.282
Well, I don't really
talk so much as listen.

20:52.915 --> 20:56.851
And do you know what
they're saying right now?

20:58.152 --> 21:00.657
That you're not here to talk at all.

21:01.542 --> 21:05.519
The dead... Always so perceptive.

21:05.731 --> 21:07.431
Dark One.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.382
Sending little girls to
do your dirty work now?

21:11.884 --> 21:13.183
Well, what can I say?

21:13.519 --> 21:15.501
Always love a good loophole.

21:22.446 --> 21:23.624
Don't move!

21:24.534 --> 21:26.367
That's a good girl.

21:26.759 --> 21:28.577
You'll pay for this.

21:28.602 --> 21:29.553
So, what do we do now,

21:29.655 --> 21:32.183
just order him to give up the magic?

21:32.208 --> 21:33.674
Oh, we don't have to.

21:33.699 --> 21:36.737
All we need is right there.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.973
You know, the only cure
for a poisoned heart

21:41.075 --> 21:44.309
is to sacrifice someone else's.

21:44.905 --> 21:47.092
So if you want to save your father...

21:48.178 --> 21:50.482
you have to crush his heart.

21:51.147 --> 21:53.145
So you found who you were looking for,

21:53.170 --> 21:55.225
and I'm the test.

21:55.269 --> 21:56.669
How convenient.

21:56.694 --> 21:57.869
What test?

21:57.894 --> 21:59.594
Nothing. Silence him.

21:59.676 --> 22:02.686
- Listen to me, little girl...
- Just shut up!

22:04.569 --> 22:07.325
Oh, I'm not sure if I can do this.

22:07.350 --> 22:10.016
Oh, I-I-I know it's hard.

22:10.802 --> 22:12.277
Let me help you.

22:12.677 --> 22:15.582
All you have to do is start.

22:16.093 --> 22:20.022
One little twitch of a finger,

22:20.047 --> 22:22.147
and I'll finish the job.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.482
Crush.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.484
Over before you know it.

22:26.053 --> 22:30.356
Just one little twitch, Alice.

22:31.489 --> 22:35.106
One. Little. Twitch.

22:35.723 --> 22:37.354
No. No, sorry!

22:37.379 --> 22:38.597
I just can't!

22:49.119 --> 22:50.109
Alice.

22:50.211 --> 22:51.277
Alice, wait.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.412
You knew I was gonna have to do that.

22:53.481 --> 22:54.880
You should've told me!

22:54.949 --> 22:56.815
I-I couldn't, because...

22:57.445 --> 22:58.851
well, then you wouldn't have come,

22:59.712 --> 23:01.612
and I had to know.

23:01.681 --> 23:02.880
Know what?

23:03.312 --> 23:05.725
Well, I've been searching for someone...

23:05.818 --> 23:09.420
A very powerful person
who's gonna do something

23:09.488 --> 23:12.956
far greater than anyone
has ever done before.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.326
And, Alice, that person...

23:16.701 --> 23:19.735
is you.

23:23.170 --> 23:27.199
So, it seems Roni was right
to be concerned about you.

23:27.224 --> 23:29.394
Let's leave her out of this.

23:29.419 --> 23:30.918
This is between you and me.

23:30.943 --> 23:31.962
Fine.

23:31.987 --> 23:34.805
Well, feel free to look
around. I have nothing to hide.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.391
I don't expect to find anything here.

23:37.493 --> 23:39.326
You're smarter than that.

23:39.428 --> 23:41.597
Wherever you put that dagger,

23:41.622 --> 23:43.022
you've hidden it well.

23:43.159 --> 23:45.899
Now you are gonna tell me where it is.

23:47.172 --> 23:50.585
You pull that trigger,
you don't get back

23:50.618 --> 23:54.074
to that sweet, little
wife on the Other Side...

23:54.625 --> 23:59.189
If she's even still waiting for you.

23:59.214 --> 24:01.927
I'm betting that's a risk

24:01.952 --> 24:04.282
you're not willing to take.

24:08.470 --> 24:11.446
I will find where
you've put that dagger...

24:13.101 --> 24:15.468
however I have to.

24:15.668 --> 24:17.334
I'm sure that's true.

24:18.061 --> 24:20.136
But the next time you threaten me,

24:20.161 --> 24:22.342
you better follow through.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.361
You okay?

24:49.165 --> 24:50.630
Yeah.

24:50.732 --> 24:53.699
Yeah, let's just get this over with.

24:54.590 --> 24:55.256
I should warn you,

24:55.281 --> 24:57.648
even if you do find what
it is you're looking for,

24:58.106 --> 24:59.308
it likely won't be

24:59.333 --> 25:01.900
the, uh, revelation that you're hoping.

25:02.941 --> 25:04.243
I just want the truth.

25:04.345 --> 25:06.262
The truth can be complicated, Henry,

25:06.287 --> 25:08.996
especially when it comes to the
mind of a deranged psychopath.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.633
Is that what you're looking for?

25:33.330 --> 25:34.729
Someone's here?

25:41.833 --> 25:44.834
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Stay there.

26:10.928 --> 26:14.062
You don't have to do this.
I'm one of the good guys.

26:14.087 --> 26:16.375
Is that why I've got pictures of
you outside a potential murder scene?

26:16.400 --> 26:18.567
I'm in danger, same as Nick was.

26:19.141 --> 26:21.136
I was looking for
something to protect myself.

26:21.238 --> 26:22.404
From who?

26:22.506 --> 26:25.646
Baron Samdi... The guy who killed him.

26:26.263 --> 26:28.288
You mean the person
that you were helping?

26:28.313 --> 26:29.879
I didn't have a choice.

26:29.904 --> 26:31.566
That's why I came here.

26:31.591 --> 26:32.981
I figured Samdi must've killed Nick

26:33.083 --> 26:34.716
because he had something on him,

26:35.294 --> 26:36.318
and maybe if I could find it,

26:36.420 --> 26:38.387
I could use it to protect myself.

26:39.239 --> 26:40.489
If you're so afraid of this Samdi,

26:40.591 --> 26:41.990
then why not just come to the police?

26:42.092 --> 26:43.959
You saw what happened to the other guy.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.161
Samdi's powerful...

26:46.638 --> 26:48.597
In ways you can't even possibly imagine.

26:48.699 --> 26:50.165
Try me.

26:51.296 --> 26:53.335
You'll think I'm crazy if I tell you.

26:54.413 --> 26:55.671
But look at the M.E.'s report

26:55.773 --> 26:57.272
on your dead killer.

26:57.374 --> 26:58.607
Look at it good,

26:58.709 --> 27:01.176
because what happened to him...

27:01.832 --> 27:04.199
that's just the tip of the iceberg.

27:10.143 --> 27:11.090
Sorry.

27:11.115 --> 27:14.212
I got waylaid by some
hot chocolate... so yummy.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.690
I may never leave this place.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.339
Oh, look what else I found.

27:19.381 --> 27:21.181
- Is that one of yours?
- No.

27:21.206 --> 27:22.699
It's one of yours.

27:22.724 --> 27:23.814
I saw it at the counter,

27:23.839 --> 27:26.259
and it reminded me of
you for some reason.

27:26.328 --> 27:28.194
I know we aren't exactly in Thailand,

27:28.263 --> 27:30.196
but this felt like an adventure to me.

27:31.433 --> 27:33.066
I love it.

27:34.336 --> 27:36.369
Oh. What is that?

27:37.429 --> 27:38.552
What is what?

27:38.577 --> 27:40.443
What's that buzzing, like
this morning but louder.

27:40.468 --> 27:43.336
- Ahh. You can't hear that?
- No, I... But it's okay.

27:43.361 --> 27:44.842
- I'll go get some water.
- No, I don't need water!

27:44.867 --> 27:46.481
I need it to stop!

27:46.506 --> 27:48.273
Sorry.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.941
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

27:50.444 --> 27:51.609
I can't do this right now.

27:51.678 --> 27:53.044
Wait. No! Tilly!

27:53.113 --> 27:54.179
No, I-I have to go.

27:54.204 --> 27:55.937
I'm sorry.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.086
Is that her?

29:10.133 --> 29:11.232
Your wife?

29:12.191 --> 29:14.605
It must have been a great love story.

29:15.127 --> 29:20.397
She saw the best in me
when no one else could,

29:20.633 --> 29:23.000
- including myself.
- Hmm.

29:23.836 --> 29:25.165
Robin was the first person

29:25.190 --> 29:27.724
to see something special in me, too.

29:27.749 --> 29:30.079
Not sure I would've
seen it if she hadn't.

29:33.264 --> 29:35.431
What do you think it's like there,

29:35.523 --> 29:37.428
where your Belle is?

29:38.885 --> 29:40.131
I don't know.

29:42.092 --> 29:43.076
I hope it's somewhere

29:43.101 --> 29:45.474
where you get to be with
the people you love forever,

29:46.025 --> 29:49.360
and you don't have to
think about life anymore.

29:49.462 --> 29:51.228
That's how it should be,

29:52.370 --> 29:53.341
'cause I know what it's like

29:53.366 --> 29:56.667
to watch the world go
by and not be in it.

29:57.323 --> 29:58.803
It's terribly lonely.

29:58.905 --> 30:00.438
Yes, it is.

30:01.469 --> 30:03.507
Suppose I won't have
to worry about that now.

30:04.211 --> 30:05.710
I'm in the world forever...

30:06.231 --> 30:08.432
No more towers for me.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.589
So, how do we do it?

30:12.215 --> 30:13.977
I'm not sure.

30:14.002 --> 30:16.002
It's... It's never been done before.

30:21.199 --> 30:22.826
I-I think the dagger knows.

30:24.527 --> 30:26.660
It's trying to tell me.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.869
You're a good man, Rumple.

31:05.488 --> 31:07.940
Your heart is pure.

31:17.643 --> 31:22.112
You will find the answer you
need to get rid of the dagger.

31:27.728 --> 31:34.675
And you will find your way
back to me again... I promise.

31:45.450 --> 31:47.049
- No!
- Aah!

31:48.482 --> 31:50.415
What did you do?

32:04.622 --> 32:06.431
I did what I had to.

32:07.451 --> 32:10.951
I made a promise that
when I passed this on,

32:12.068 --> 32:13.888
it wouldn't be a burden.

32:14.068 --> 32:16.535
And that's exactly
what it will be for you.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.026
I don't understand.

32:18.128 --> 32:20.395
Immortality...

32:20.830 --> 32:23.681
is just another tower.

32:24.174 --> 32:26.189
You deserve better than that.

32:26.214 --> 32:30.460
You're gonna fall in love,
grow old with someone,

32:30.485 --> 32:34.618
live a normal life free of towers.

32:35.681 --> 32:37.437
But what will happen to you?

32:37.462 --> 32:40.415
I guess I'll just have
to find another way,

32:40.844 --> 32:41.976
even if that means

32:42.001 --> 32:44.594
I'll lose the battle with
the darkness to do so.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.728
No, you won't.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.383
I won't let that happen, no matter what.

32:48.649 --> 32:49.817
I know who you really are,

32:49.842 --> 32:51.742
and I won't let you forget it.

33:09.012 --> 33:10.378
Weaver!

33:10.721 --> 33:12.589
I'm so glad to see
you. Can you hear that?

33:12.691 --> 33:14.057
Tilly, please, not now.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.525
I-It's different this time.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.227
I-I thought it was a
buzzing, but it's not.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.889
I realize now... It... it's a voice.

33:19.914 --> 33:21.380
Can you hear it?

33:21.405 --> 33:22.499
It's trying to tell me something,

33:22.601 --> 33:25.135
but I don't know what it is.

33:26.148 --> 33:27.498
How long have you been
hearing this voice?

33:27.523 --> 33:28.972
Since this morning.

33:40.195 --> 33:41.995
What is that?

33:43.793 --> 33:44.885
Did you take this?

33:44.910 --> 33:46.241
No! I don't know how that got in there.

33:46.266 --> 33:47.835
Tilly, I'm not playing games.

33:47.860 --> 33:50.257
Did you break into the
evidence locker and take this?!

33:50.282 --> 33:52.749
No! I swear I didn't! I-I
wasn't even near there.

33:52.774 --> 33:53.906
I...

33:54.380 --> 33:56.013
Wait.

33:56.741 --> 33:58.983
Wait, the voice... It just...

33:59.051 --> 34:00.636
It just stopped.

34:04.379 --> 34:06.049
It's that, isn't it?

34:07.516 --> 34:09.248
I don't understand.

34:10.696 --> 34:13.364
It's all right. I-I do.

34:15.201 --> 34:17.034
You were guarding it for me.

34:24.797 --> 34:27.498
Are you angry with me?

34:30.750 --> 34:32.539
No, Tilly.

34:34.353 --> 34:36.654
You're not the one I'm angry with.

35:03.516 --> 35:05.550
Dark One.

35:11.484 --> 35:16.253
I heard about what you
did for Alice and Robin.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.692
All magic comes with a price.

35:21.761 --> 35:24.795
Guess it was finally my turn to pay.

35:25.756 --> 35:26.730
Well, I just wanted to tell you

35:26.832 --> 35:28.032
everyone was right about you.

35:28.134 --> 35:30.100
You're not the Crocodile I knew.

35:30.701 --> 35:32.001
I owe you a great debt.

35:32.026 --> 35:33.859
If I can ever repay you, I will.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.834
Dark One and a pirate...

35:41.061 --> 35:42.534
friends?

35:42.725 --> 35:44.855
Perhaps it's time for a new story.

35:58.343 --> 36:00.469
So, what are you gonna do now?

36:01.220 --> 36:03.301
Do what Rumplestiltskin
does best, of course...

36:03.369 --> 36:05.236
Spin, spin, spin!

36:08.641 --> 36:11.509
Spin, spin, spin.

36:15.997 --> 36:17.463
Spin, spin,

36:17.488 --> 36:21.552
spin, spin, spin, spin,
spin, spin, spin, spin...

36:49.374 --> 36:52.077
That was the only bit of
magic I had to cure Henry.

36:52.102 --> 36:53.853
And you knew that!

36:54.495 --> 36:56.312
You stole it anyway, didn't you?

36:57.112 --> 36:58.373
Yes, I did.

36:59.268 --> 37:01.368
So lemme guess...

37:01.393 --> 37:04.385
You used it to find
your precious dagger?

37:05.409 --> 37:07.617
Actually, the Guardian did.

37:08.569 --> 37:10.328
The Guardian?

37:12.164 --> 37:13.915
I thought Anastasia was the Guardian.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.339
We sent her back with Ivy.

37:15.408 --> 37:17.107
She was a potential Guardian.

37:17.176 --> 37:18.909
There was another before her,

37:18.978 --> 37:22.846
and today, she made sure
the dagger was kept safe.

37:24.435 --> 37:25.515
Safe.

37:27.152 --> 37:30.291
So the dagger was never
in danger to begin with.

37:31.317 --> 37:34.055
So everything you did
today was for nothing?

37:34.080 --> 37:36.126
Look, if you want to be angry, be angry.

37:36.151 --> 37:37.872
You certainly have the right.

37:39.121 --> 37:41.188
But I did what I had to do.

37:42.886 --> 37:46.254
You know, after everything
we've been through...

37:46.510 --> 37:49.344
I thought you could trust
me enough to help you.

37:49.559 --> 37:52.293
But instead, you went behind my back

37:52.362 --> 37:54.028
and betrayed me to get what you want,

37:54.130 --> 37:55.530
like you always do

37:55.957 --> 37:58.157
and continue to put
Henry's life at risk.

38:01.075 --> 38:02.503
No matter what you tell yourself,

38:02.572 --> 38:04.806
you haven't changed a bit.

38:04.874 --> 38:07.330
And I'm done with it.

38:08.244 --> 38:09.358
You and I...

38:11.498 --> 38:13.265
we're through.

38:34.688 --> 38:36.091
Thought you could use this

38:36.116 --> 38:38.083
after what happened with that Drew guy,

38:38.147 --> 38:39.841
and I wanted to say thanks again

38:39.866 --> 38:41.932
for bringing me there today.

38:42.614 --> 38:44.885
Of course. I was happy to.

38:44.910 --> 38:46.210
Did it help?

38:46.515 --> 38:47.557
I don't know yet.

38:47.582 --> 38:49.217
Uh...

38:49.319 --> 38:51.252
Kind of hard to explain...

38:51.354 --> 38:53.354
Not really sure you'd
believe me if I could.

38:55.201 --> 38:57.602
People keep saying that to me today.

38:58.851 --> 39:00.132
But after everything that's happened,

39:00.157 --> 39:01.469
I might just believe anything.

39:01.865 --> 39:03.366
Why's that?

39:07.835 --> 39:10.104
This is the M.E.'s report on Nick.

39:10.129 --> 39:12.984
According to them, our
lawyer turned serial killer

39:13.009 --> 39:15.778
was stabbed through
the heart one time...

39:15.803 --> 39:17.904
from the inside.

39:18.903 --> 39:19.947
What?

39:20.754 --> 39:22.622
Well, how's that even possible?

39:22.647 --> 39:25.014
Well, I'm no medical
expert, but I'd say it's not.

39:25.514 --> 39:26.746
And the question is,

39:26.771 --> 39:28.571
what the hell is going on in this town?

39:46.508 --> 39:48.376
Turns out you were right...

39:48.444 --> 39:50.711
You really can put candy on anything.

39:52.321 --> 39:53.620
I see that.

39:55.412 --> 39:56.884
Okay.

39:57.445 --> 39:59.254
So, here's the thing about me.

39:59.340 --> 40:01.559
I'm never quite sure what
kind of day it's gonna be.

40:01.584 --> 40:03.793
Sometimes I wake up and
the whole day is good,

40:03.818 --> 40:05.050
and then...

40:05.691 --> 40:07.625
sometimes it's not.

40:08.889 --> 40:12.060
And I don't want you to
see the not-good days.

40:12.982 --> 40:14.627
Not yet...

40:14.695 --> 40:18.330
Because it can be a bit
too much for some people.

40:22.497 --> 40:23.959
I get that.

40:25.677 --> 40:26.972
But you don't have to worry

40:27.623 --> 40:30.257
because it won't be too much for me,

40:30.282 --> 40:32.749
no matter what kind of day it is.

40:36.351 --> 40:39.052
You dropped this on your
way out of the store.

40:39.154 --> 40:40.143
Can I?

40:40.168 --> 40:41.206
Mm.

40:46.870 --> 40:48.461
There.

40:56.094 --> 40:57.337
It's beautiful.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.617
Now, then, how 'bout a drink?

41:03.609 --> 41:05.014
Absolutely.

41:08.989 --> 41:10.016
Henry?

41:10.041 --> 41:10.833
Hey.

41:10.858 --> 41:13.494
Um, I know it's late, but can I come in?

41:13.596 --> 41:15.146
O-Of course.

41:19.907 --> 41:21.273
What is it?

41:26.323 --> 41:29.239
Okay, so this morning

41:29.264 --> 41:30.697
when you asked me about Nick?

41:31.596 --> 41:35.072
Well, more important
than anything he said

41:35.097 --> 41:36.569
was something he showed me.

41:37.636 --> 41:38.986
What do you mean?

41:39.088 --> 41:41.755
Okay, remember when
Lucy was in the hospital

41:41.857 --> 41:43.636
and I gave blood in
case I could help her?

41:43.661 --> 41:45.160
Yeah.

41:45.185 --> 41:47.886
Well, they ran a whole
bunch of tests, right,

41:47.911 --> 41:50.908
and Nick had the results,

41:50.933 --> 41:53.003
including one...

41:53.436 --> 41:56.337
that just didn't make any sense.

42:06.738 --> 42:09.872
I called the hospital as
soon as I got my hands on it.

42:10.883 --> 42:12.086
It's real.

42:12.188 --> 42:14.288
I-I-I don't understand.

42:14.313 --> 42:16.713
I don't, either, but, Jacinda,

42:16.892 --> 42:18.425
according to that,

42:18.527 --> 42:22.256
Lucy's been right this whole time.

42:23.850 --> 42:26.567
I am her father.
