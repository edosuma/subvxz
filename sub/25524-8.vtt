WEBVTT

00:04.480 --> 00:06.640
And I will give you
anything you ask for.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.000
Your uncle is
a monstrous incubus.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.720
It is him I protect you from.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.000
I'm here for my sister.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.480
She's over-indulged.

00:13.560 --> 00:14.720
A girl still lives

00:14.800 --> 00:16.440
who can name you
as her attacker.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.160
Mother.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.520
There's a girl at Quigley's.

00:19.640 --> 00:20.640
Turn her loose,

00:20.680 --> 00:21.960
she'll tell her tale to the law.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.120
You are unburdened
of this office

00:24.160 --> 00:25.520
with immediate effect!

00:25.640 --> 00:28.040
The Lord Justice
was going to spare your mother,

00:28.160 --> 00:29.640
but I implored him not to.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.600
You will go to the jail
immediately

00:31.640 --> 00:33.120
and hang Margaret Wells.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.320
Get her down, man!

00:43.560 --> 00:46.040
Tomorrow, you set sail
for America.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.600
No, there is no hope for me
without my family!

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

01:33.200 --> 01:35.280
We're too early, no one's here.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.480
I am no longer
a servant of the law.

01:51.560 --> 01:55.640
I must leave this house
and seek new employment.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.640
So, with regret,

01:59.680 --> 02:01.200
I cannot marry.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.040
I see.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.560
My situation is too precarious.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.840
Please be honest.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.280
You've discovered
my mother's past

02:08.400 --> 02:10.680
and balk at the daughter
of a harlot.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.800
It is not a matter
of my feelings.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.400
You've made your feelings
very clear.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.280
Forgive me if I keep mine
to myself.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.520
I'm sorry for what's happened.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.240
We've come for Margaret's body
so we can bury her.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.080
You'll not find it
at the magistrate's.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.520
Then where?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.840
The bodies of all murderers

02:46.960 --> 02:48.280
are sent to the Surgeon's Hall.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.600
Must you abuse her body
even when she's dead?

02:50.680 --> 02:53.520
Please take your grievance
to my successor.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.120
I am no longer a Justice.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.240
You've always been
my guiding example,

03:48.280 --> 03:50.120
like a brother.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.360
You'll vouch for me
with the others, won't you?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.560
I want to help you, but...

03:55.600 --> 03:57.120
the puritan you stabbed

03:57.240 --> 04:01.280
may wake and point
her righteous finger.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.560
I have an alibi.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.600
From your mistress
and a paid bawd?

04:06.680 --> 04:09.360
It must be nipped,
little brother.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.120
How?

04:12.160 --> 04:14.000
She's under
the magistrate's roof.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.240
Do it swiftly.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.360
"The hanging was carried out
behind closed doors,"

04:32.400 --> 04:35.240
prompting accusations
of corruption.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.600
Wells was an infamous bawd
and rabble-rouser,

04:37.680 --> 04:39.040
and citizens have been robbed

04:39.160 --> 04:41.840
"of their right to witness
her public execution."

04:49.240 --> 04:50.280
To Margaret Wells.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.280
I feel as if I've lost a friend.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.120
It's the kippers.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.840
The Marquess of Blayne is here.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.720
Am I not like the Queen of Spain

05:17.800 --> 05:19.720
with my living miniature?

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
No.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.400
Your intelligence was too late.

05:29.480 --> 05:30.920
The child
had already been lifted

05:31.000 --> 05:32.720
from her orphan school
by a black,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.920
sent by my sister.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.480
That same flaunting scoundrel

05:36.560 --> 05:37.800
who bid for my virgin.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.040
I want the child found

05:39.160 --> 05:41.600
before my crazed sister
poisons it against me.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.720
Then...

05:45.800 --> 05:47.920
lend me a man.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.680
I know where
this upstart black resides.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.040
I kneel at your altar,
High Priestess.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.800
And my first burnt offering
will be Charlotte Wells.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.800
It's usually done for me.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.240
I was once a servant
for a fine family.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.160
What made you leave?

06:23.240 --> 06:26.040
The son kept attacking me.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.600
I got with child,
so they threw me out.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.600
So now I'm getting paid for it.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.920
What happened to your child?

06:35.040 --> 06:36.840
Dead.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.160
Jam there if you want some.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.000
Pa.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.920
We must get through.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.240
There'll be no
getting through for me.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.160
No getting through until
I've buried Margaret Wells.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.040
Then we'll go and get her body.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.160
I'll not have you
harrowed by that sight.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.160
What of you?

07:20.240 --> 07:23.160
Let me do it alone?

07:52.240 --> 07:53.800
You just missed your family.

07:53.920 --> 07:54.920
Did I?

07:56.920 --> 07:58.560
Are you all right?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.720
I'm fine.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.160
How does Miss Scanwell?

08:03.240 --> 08:05.240
Come see for yourself.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.720
Miss Wells!

08:13.800 --> 08:15.240
Miss Scanwell.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.360
What was done to you...

08:18.400 --> 08:20.360
it's terrible.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.720
I'm not in so much pain now.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.240
Did you see who did it?

08:25.280 --> 08:27.840
He... he was a gentleman.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.480
White wigged.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.120
What was he wearing?

08:33.200 --> 08:35.840
A dark green cloak

08:35.960 --> 08:38.120
and a velvet jacket.

08:41.440 --> 08:42.640
Lord Fallon.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.080
Your keeper?

08:44.120 --> 08:46.000
I must tell my mother.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.520
I need my mother.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.120
Do you not know?

08:49.240 --> 08:50.600
Child,

08:50.720 --> 08:52.240
your mother was imprisoned

08:52.360 --> 08:55.600
for the murder that she did.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.320
She did no murder.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.120
She confessed to it.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.360
They hanged her yesterday.

09:07.720 --> 09:08.960
Keep her here.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.320
- Make her sit.
- Lucy!

09:56.640 --> 09:58.080
I'm so sorry.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.360
I know we had
our disputes, but...

10:02.440 --> 10:05.240
Mrs. Wells took me in
when I had nothing.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.760
I must get her body
from the Surgeon's Hall.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.760
Let me come with you.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.120
I'm not fit for company.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.320
You cannot go alone
on such an errand.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.360
You once did me
the greatest service.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.760
I'm coming with you now.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.600
The next cull I bring,
you will smile

10:42.640 --> 10:43.760
and be pleasant,

10:43.840 --> 10:45.760
or I shall tell Mrs. Quigley.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.080
I once spent weeks
locked in a room here.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.720
Charlotte Wells has
sent me to get you out.

11:00.840 --> 11:01.880
Be ready.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.640
We'll go when it's dark.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.000
It's a fortunate day
for you, Abigail.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.360
This is Sir Henry Phipps.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.640
You've played your hand well,

11:19.720 --> 11:22.600
convincing Charles
that that brat is his.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.480
I wish I'd thought of that
when he was tupping me.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.000
Let's go for a little walk.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.120
Will you go for a walk with me?

11:51.440 --> 11:52.880
Leave the bottle.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.720
Are you drinking
to quell your guilt?

12:24.760 --> 12:26.880
You hanged the wrong person.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.760
My mother didn't kill
Sir George Howard.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.840
I no longer work
for court nor crown.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.480
He was trying to force me.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.760
I picked up the knife.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.000
Your mother confessed

12:36.080 --> 12:38.200
because your keeper
knew your guilt

12:38.240 --> 12:41.440
and held it over her.

12:41.480 --> 12:44.840
So keep your secrets,
Lucy Wells.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.440
And I'll keep mine.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.240
Lord Fallon.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.000
He stabbed Miss Scanwell.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.320
How will I ever prove it so

12:57.360 --> 12:59.760
when you gave him an alibi?

13:57.240 --> 13:58.880
Shh, shh.

13:59.000 --> 13:59.880
It's okay.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.360
Shh, shh.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.640
Don't be kind,

14:12.720 --> 14:15.000
or tears will come.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.120
I need to be busy.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.880
Then let me give you a task.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.840
Only money will free us
from my brother.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.320
I need the law's help
to secure my inheritance.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.360
Come with me.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.520
Charlotte, I'm sorry
for your loss,

14:35.600 --> 14:37.480
but you promised your help.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.480
I can't stay here,
it's not fit for Sophia.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.080
You've got your child,

14:42.120 --> 14:43.640
and you're free
of Lydia Quigley.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.000
My sister is in the sway
of a dangerous man.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.760
Forgive me, but your
money has to wait.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.480
Charlotte.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.880
Where's Lucy?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.840
There's no sign of her.

15:05.880 --> 15:09.120
I just caught Lord Fallon
trying to smother Amelia.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.480
We tied him up.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.600
Where's the Justice?

15:12.720 --> 15:13.960
Ex-Justice.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.760
In the tavern,
drowning his sorrows.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.720
Then the law is ours to enforce.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.720
I'll make sure
he doesn't come back.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.240
No, no!

15:42.640 --> 15:44.440
Get off me!

15:44.480 --> 15:45.840
Get off me!

15:45.880 --> 15:48.480
Where's Sophia Fitzwilliam?

15:48.520 --> 15:49.520
The schoolgirl!

15:49.600 --> 15:50.640
What schoolgirl?

15:50.720 --> 15:53.000
Give him an aide-mémoire.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.600
Twice...

16:04.640 --> 16:08.840
you have tried to kill my child.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.840
She has your mark on her belly.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.440
Here's mine.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.080
What have you done to him?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.240
What the Old Testament teaches.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.600
He was stifling
my invalid child.

16:39.520 --> 16:43.000
Do you plead and howl

16:43.080 --> 16:45.520
like a wet boy?

16:45.600 --> 16:49.600
You, who told me
killing is an art?

16:49.720 --> 16:53.000
My mother is dead
because of how you use me!

16:58.240 --> 17:01.480
I didn't mean to use you.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.640
What I feel for you is true.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.680
Liar!

17:04.720 --> 17:06.000
He's one of the beasts

17:06.040 --> 17:07.920
who was coming for Emily Lacey,

17:08.000 --> 17:09.440
and for me.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.280
Kitty.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.040
You killed Kitty Carter.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.160
No.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.480
No, I did not.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.079
Stop her, please.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.000
Make him squeal, Lucy.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.319
It was Lidington.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.960
Did he hold her head
while you sliced?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.480
- Geld him.
- Not yet!

17:37.560 --> 17:39.000
We want them all.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.400
Lidington and who?

17:49.480 --> 17:50.800
I saw you with Quigley

17:50.920 --> 17:53.200
and the Marquess of Blayne.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.160
Do you think I fear hanging?

17:56.240 --> 17:58.800
Go fetch your Justice
and his lumpen men.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.040
Let them do their worst.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.640
I don't think you understand.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.680
We are your judge and jury.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.080
Tell us what you know

18:05.200 --> 18:07.520
or I'll release
this avenging angel.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.760
I'll stab your fucking heart!

18:15.040 --> 18:17.680
Quigley brings us
girls to spoil.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.200
What of Blayne?

18:24.320 --> 18:25.720
Is he your king?

18:30.240 --> 18:32.560
Go at him, Lucy.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.320
It's Blayne!

18:35.440 --> 18:37.000
Blayne.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.440
Do you think I'd
stoop as low as you?

18:48.480 --> 18:52.040
My mother died to save my soul.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.400
I'd never tarnish it with you.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.240
Lidington, Quigley, Blayne.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.560
We have 'em.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.920
One more time.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.560
Where is she?

19:25.680 --> 19:27.800
I don't know a single schoolgirl

19:27.920 --> 19:31.480
in this whole corrupted town!

19:31.520 --> 19:33.720
I'm a fool.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.240
He's the wrong black, of course.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.720
Come.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.480
Come for Margaret Wells.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.640
Who?

19:54.720 --> 19:57.440
Margaret Wells.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.240
She's my, um...

20:02.440 --> 20:03.800
She's been...

20:03.920 --> 20:05.440
She was hanged yesterday.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.480
We've come for her remains.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.680
None of the deceased felons
bears that name.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.080
Where is she?

20:23.200 --> 20:25.080
Where all the guilty
must go when they die.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.960
Look to the borough's deadhouse
and be gone.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.000
Come on, come.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.560
Will you free me,

20:42.680 --> 20:44.240
now they've given you the boot?

20:44.320 --> 20:46.760
Your sentence
was for seven years.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.480
Remorse takes t-time.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.080
Do you not see?

20:51.200 --> 20:53.160
The only proper way
to reform my life

20:53.240 --> 20:55.400
is to pay me.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.280
Make you my eyes and ears

20:57.400 --> 21:00.240
in places such as this.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.280
Well, if I was still
a Justice, I would.

21:09.240 --> 21:11.480
You give up too easily.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.920
Did you get a new dog, Nancy?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.280
He's a bad bastard, this one.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.720
When he bites,
I have to kick him.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.000
Hey, don't you dare
barge in here!

21:35.040 --> 21:36.880
Ha, you're the barge, dear.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.480
Sophia, thank God you're safe.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.240
Your uncle has been
worried to death.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.480
She is made of lies.

21:45.560 --> 21:46.896
You must come with me
without delay.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.440
Do not listen
to a word she says.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.160
Your mother cannot help
her actions,

21:50.240 --> 21:52.040
but consider this
What sane woman

21:52.160 --> 21:54.000
would bring her child
to a low brothel,

21:54.040 --> 21:55.920
run by the flunkies
of a murderess?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.520
This place has been
our sanctuary.

21:57.640 --> 22:00.160
She's hidden you away when
you could've had a family.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.720
Your uncle is
longing to know you.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.680
My uncle is a bad man.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.480
He's a monster.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.680
Is that what she told you?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.800
He has been breaking his heart

22:12.920 --> 22:14.640
since he learnt
of your existence.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.440
He wants to make you his heir.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.640
No, no, no,
do not listen to her.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.920
Why did you forsake me
and leave me in that school?

22:21.000 --> 22:24.880
You have been in my heart
every waking hour.

22:24.960 --> 22:28.240
You have abused your brother
and your child.

22:28.320 --> 22:29.680
Come with me.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.480
Let me take you home.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.440
Sophia...

22:32.480 --> 22:34.000
This is a vile ambush!

22:34.080 --> 22:35.080
Sophia!

22:35.160 --> 22:36.216
She tells you that I'm mad,

22:36.240 --> 22:37.400
but I'm true!

22:37.480 --> 22:38.960
Sophia!

22:39.000 --> 22:40.960
Imagine your tongue circling

22:41.000 --> 22:43.880
the rosy sunrise of her nipples.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.440
Imagine my tongue

22:45.480 --> 22:47.000
where you please.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.440
There's nowhere
like Golden Square.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.200
I didn't know
how homesick I was.

22:57.240 --> 23:00.320
Charles, your mother's
stolen a girl again.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.720
She's assured me that
she's changed her ways.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.640
The proof's upstairs
being raped.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.000
This is the same
diabolical fuckery

23:08.080 --> 23:10.240
you rescued me from.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.000
Get the keys from Anne.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.960
We can't just let her go.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.080
What if she runs to the law
and has my mother hanged?

23:16.200 --> 23:17.376
Well, maybe she has it coming.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.200
Not from my hand!

23:21.480 --> 23:23.720
I'll confront my mother
when she gets back.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.520
Well, we know how that
will go, don't we?

23:32.640 --> 23:35.480
It's you and me then.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.200
If we're caught,
she'll string us both up

23:38.240 --> 23:40.400
like a pair of Christmas geese.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.280
You can die alone,

23:48.400 --> 23:50.280
or with your rapine friends.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.400
A signed confession.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.320
The law might be kind.

24:03.080 --> 24:06.920
He needs a day or two
to think on what he's done.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.800
You're a killer,

24:08.920 --> 24:10.920
same as me.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Where's your confession?

24:14.760 --> 24:18.880
I didn't think anything
would make me smile today.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.760
But that's such a pretty sight.

24:21.880 --> 24:22.920
Come on.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.080
Mrs. Quigley came
while you were out.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.480
They've taken
the Lady's daughter.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.720
I'm so sorry.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.040
You left me when
I needed your help.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.800
I'm here now,

24:43.920 --> 24:46.000
with news that'll bring
your daughter back.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.800
We must go at once
to my brother's.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.080
Lords Fallon, Lidington,

24:50.200 --> 24:51.560
and a pack of titled brutes

24:51.680 --> 24:53.960
have been raping
and killing girls.

24:56.720 --> 25:00.160
They killed Kitty Carter, Fanny.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.960
We have it from
Fallon's own mouth.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.480
Nancy Birch has him tied
at her house in Angel Court,

25:06.560 --> 25:07.920
and he's signing a confession

25:08.000 --> 25:11.320
saying that Quigley
is their procuress.

25:11.440 --> 25:15.240
Your brother is their master.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.320
No.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.000
It's true.

25:19.040 --> 25:23.200
Not even Dodds can
dismiss such evidence.

25:23.240 --> 25:26.560
Then my brother's disgrace
will be absolute.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.200
Yes.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.800
He will fall,

25:30.920 --> 25:33.040
and your daughter will be safe.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.800
I must go home.

25:34.920 --> 25:37.440
She's in great
and immediate danger.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.480
Perhaps you haven't understood.

25:40.520 --> 25:43.000
You're safe.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.880
I understand you very well.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.640
You've taught me
to fend for myself.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.640
Now you'll see how well I do.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.920
Where's she going?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.760
On her own path.

26:01.880 --> 26:05.480
Lord Fallon's safely trussed.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.720
Bit of time, he'll soon confess.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.160
How are you bearing it, sprat?

26:13.800 --> 26:15.560
Still swimming.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.400
Poor Lucy.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.200
Come on.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.880
We'll sit.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.760
Grief comes in great gusts
to blow you down.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.280
The things men do.

26:43.400 --> 26:46.520
Shh, breathe, my love.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.760
I'm empty, Nance.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.400
There's no heart in here,

26:52.480 --> 26:54.480
not for man nor woman.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.400
Nothing but stone.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.520
You have so much heart...

27:05.800 --> 27:07.960
the weight is pain.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.480
Your ma found her love.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.760
So will you and Lucy.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.960
Did you find yours?

27:22.520 --> 27:25.320
I loved your ma, you silly cunt.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.560
This is what your mother
was keeping you from.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.720
Your birthright.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.560
You must be she.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.640
How do you do, Uncle?

28:39.760 --> 28:42.920
Yesterday I learned
of your existence, and...

28:43.000 --> 28:44.320
now here you are.

28:44.440 --> 28:46.080
Where did Mrs. Quigley find you?

28:46.200 --> 28:49.400
Her mother had taken her
to the Wells brothel.

28:49.480 --> 28:51.640
Good God,
she could've ruined you.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.280
But here she is,

28:53.400 --> 28:56.280
safe and sound.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.760
Well...

29:01.200 --> 29:03.160
First, you must try

29:03.240 --> 29:06.000
some of these delicious fancies,

29:06.040 --> 29:10.080
and you will forgive me
for one moment.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.920
You will soon see my gratitude.

29:18.280 --> 29:20.320
I have a request,

29:20.440 --> 29:23.480
about Charlotte.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.080
Don't throw her on a bonfire,

29:26.200 --> 29:28.240
not yet.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.240
You want her spared?

29:30.280 --> 29:32.800
She's suffering.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.080
I like her alive
when she suffers.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.760
She's not here.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.680
And did your mother

31:08.720 --> 31:12.040
ever make mention
of your father?

31:12.160 --> 31:13.640
She said that his name

31:13.720 --> 31:16.960
is a secret that
she'll take to the grave.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.400
She seemed so calm and rational.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.680
Yes.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.680
That is a mask that...

31:23.720 --> 31:25.520
has been slipping for some time.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.920
He'll try in every way
to undermine me.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.440
He's taken my strength
since I was younger than you.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.240
Calm yourself, let me help you.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.960
You can't help anyone, Harcourt.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.920
Lord Fallon has betrayed you.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.760
What nonsense is this?

31:40.880 --> 31:43.280
He was caught trying
to murder his witness

31:43.400 --> 31:45.440
by angry, vengeful women.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.480
He spewed out your name
in return for his life.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.240
Is he arrested?

31:52.320 --> 31:54.040
Worse.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.080
The women have him,

31:56.200 --> 31:57.480
and they won't give him up

31:57.560 --> 32:00.520
until he signs
a full confession.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.320
Sophia, let's go into the house.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.880
Stay.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.240
Learn for yourself
what kind of man this is.

32:07.320 --> 32:10.240
Fallon's named you
leader of a brotherhood

32:10.320 --> 32:11.800
whose charming business

32:11.920 --> 32:14.520
is slaying and despoiling girls.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.000
This is a monstrous fantasy.

32:20.040 --> 32:23.480
I know where
they're holding him.

32:23.560 --> 32:26.280
Sign over my fortune
and full keeping of my child,

32:26.400 --> 32:27.560
and I might tell you.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.480
Where is Fallon?

32:35.960 --> 32:38.200
I want our house in St. James's

32:38.240 --> 32:41.000
where you'll never come near us,

32:41.080 --> 32:42.800
and your signed assurance

32:42.920 --> 32:45.680
that no harm will ever
come to Charlotte Wells.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.200
Very well.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.880
If I hated you,
I'd let you fall.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.720
But I cannot,

32:57.800 --> 32:59.880
because you are my brother.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.560
God damn you.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.240
It's the second time in a week
she's had me beaten.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.800
We don't get paid
enough for this.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.240
There was a bad look
in her eyes, Charles.

33:18.320 --> 33:22.800
She was thrilled
to cause me pain.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.680
Why would she do it in my house?

33:24.720 --> 33:26.200
Can I just ask what you're doing

33:26.240 --> 33:29.400
for the 50 pound a week that
we're earning on our backs?

33:38.200 --> 33:39.720
I need your keys, Anne.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.520
Take your hobgoblin
and get out of my way.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.520
You're such a lofty bitch,
aren't ya?

33:44.640 --> 33:46.640
You'd fire a blunderbuss
on your own mother

33:46.720 --> 33:48.320
if Mrs. Quigley told you to.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.680
I would; I hate my mother.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.520
I shall tell Charles.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.720
You do that.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.040
I see what this is.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.720
You made up this vile tale
to try and swindle me.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.600
Fifty pounds is the swindle.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.560
You're lucky to be
earning anything at all!

34:10.639 --> 34:12.096
- Charles!
- You'd rather we were slaves?

34:12.120 --> 34:12.920
Nell, be calm.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.560
Slaves wouldn't answer back!

34:14.639 --> 34:17.000
And I am getting
sick of your lip!

34:17.080 --> 34:19.159
- Are you, flabbermouth?
- Charles!

34:19.280 --> 34:20.920
If you don't want to pay,

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
go back to the gutter.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.080
I'd rather be there

34:23.159 --> 34:24.920
than give my earnings
to a halfwit.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Impudent drab!

34:26.040 --> 34:27.520
You're so dim
you don't even know

34:27.600 --> 34:29.840
Emily Lacey's shoving
a cushion up her stays!

34:29.920 --> 34:32.080
Charles, she's letting
your mother's property escape.

34:34.760 --> 34:35.960
What's this?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.576
She's going, Charles,
it's the right thing.

34:37.600 --> 34:38.920
I mean, what's this?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.159
What do you mean?

34:40.280 --> 34:41.480
What are you doing?

34:41.560 --> 34:43.520
Charlie, get off!

34:47.679 --> 34:48.679
Go.

34:48.760 --> 34:51.040
While you still can, go.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.639
You lie about everything.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.440
You're worse than my mother.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.680
Did you tell him?

34:57.800 --> 34:59.280
It came out, I was angry.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.560
Thank you very
fucking much, Nell.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.760
Do you think I'm an utter fool?

35:03.840 --> 35:05.840
Get out.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.480
All of you, go on with her.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.080
You have one day to clear
your things out of my house.

35:10.160 --> 35:12.120
It's not your house, it's mine.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.160
Do you think my mother
would be stupid enough

35:14.280 --> 35:16.440
to put the deeds in your name?

35:16.480 --> 35:18.040
The house has always been mine.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.160
If you could read,
you'd know that.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.000
Charlie, you're speaking
in a temper.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.960
Out!

35:45.600 --> 35:47.680
You let women do this to you?

35:53.640 --> 35:55.920
They'll pay.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.480
They'll pay.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.800
How could Emily say she loves me

36:09.880 --> 36:13.960
and then do something
so deceitful?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.960
I've not spent much time
around your mother,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.680
but I've seen enough
to scare me.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.360
Emily must've been desperate
to tell a lie like that.

36:46.680 --> 36:50.000
Well, he didn't escape on
his own, I'll tell you that.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.480
Lady Fitz.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.600
She told Blayne.

36:54.680 --> 36:58.080
Did no one ever tell you
blood's thicker than water?

37:00.680 --> 37:03.480
I feel cursed, Nance.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.040
The wealthy stick together

37:05.120 --> 37:08.480
like pig's cheeks in molasses.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.480
Where in this cock city
is Emily Lacey?

37:13.840 --> 37:15.880
If that stolen girl
from Golden Square speaks,

37:15.960 --> 37:18.960
we can still get Blayne
and Quigley to the law.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.960
Her baby was pure fibbery.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.760
Hallelujah.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.880
A lifetime of whoring

37:27.960 --> 37:32.080
has left her barren
as a jam jar.

37:32.160 --> 37:37.920
Anne, we are on
our way up and up.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.160
My poor darling.

37:46.280 --> 37:51.000
Thank God Emily Lacey
is out of your life.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.560
What about this Abigail girl?

37:53.640 --> 37:55.680
Have you abducted her?

37:55.800 --> 37:58.160
Of course not.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.640
I gave you my promise

37:59.760 --> 38:01.960
I would never do anything
like that ever again.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.360
Well, that's what I thought.

38:04.440 --> 38:07.440
So, when Emily let her go,
I didn't stop her.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.280
You've been led around
by your fuckstress

38:11.360 --> 38:12.560
like a donkey on a rope.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.440
How dare you let her
free my property?

38:14.480 --> 38:16.000
So you did abduct her?

38:16.080 --> 38:17.560
Charles...

38:20.560 --> 38:22.040
Charles,

38:22.120 --> 38:24.440
I have the Marquess of Blayne

38:24.480 --> 38:27.080
eating walnuts from my hand.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.080
How can you put
all this at risk?

38:29.160 --> 38:31.280
I haven't,
if you're speaking true.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.280
I couldn't stop them.

38:36.360 --> 38:38.440
Charlotte Wells
and her tripe-dog.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.640
- What do you want?
- A gibbet.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.960
Your carcass
swinging in the wind.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.400
Mrs. May and I
had a joke about you.

38:45.480 --> 38:47.800
We used to say the midwife
had thrown away the baby

38:47.880 --> 38:49.120
and kept the afterbirth.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.520
You were so unsightly,

38:51.600 --> 38:54.080
fit only for rough usage.

38:54.160 --> 38:58.800
Anne, fetch Abigail Warren.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.880
Charles, you are
brilliant after all.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.920
There is no such girl
in this house.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.800
She took a chance and ran off.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.280
Where's Emily Lacey?

39:11.360 --> 39:13.360
My son has booted her
into a ditch.

39:13.440 --> 39:16.520
- Shut up!
- Charles!

39:16.600 --> 39:18.000
It was your mother

39:18.080 --> 39:21.840
who assured that mine
kissed the rope.

39:21.920 --> 39:25.160
Is that true?

39:25.280 --> 39:27.320
I asked her to heal our rift,

39:27.400 --> 39:28.920
but she refused.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.160
She had been offered clemency,

39:31.280 --> 39:33.680
and you rode
the Lord Chief Justice

39:33.800 --> 39:35.800
to a rushed, degraded hanging.

39:35.880 --> 39:37.880
Even now I'm acting
to protect you.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.680
There are powerful men
who want you dead,

39:39.800 --> 39:41.320
but I said, "No, spare her."

39:41.400 --> 39:43.760
I cherish her,
in spite of everything."

39:43.840 --> 39:45.640
You are unbelievable.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.000
Charles, leave me alone.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.000
Get the keys.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.600
Unhand me, you ridiculous boy!

39:49.680 --> 39:51.280
A taste of your own medicine.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.920
How dare you!

39:55.000 --> 39:56.160
Anne, get Blayne.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.920
Get Blayne!

39:58.000 --> 40:00.480
Say the word "Spartan"
and he will come!

40:04.680 --> 40:06.880
Charles, let me out!

40:06.960 --> 40:08.280
Let me out!

40:09.640 --> 40:12.280
She enables rape
and sanctions murder.

40:13.760 --> 40:14.760
You know this.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.280
Charles, you little bastard!

40:16.360 --> 40:17.680
She is my mother.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.440
You ingrate!

40:19.480 --> 40:21.400
I can't hang her,

40:21.480 --> 40:23.280
no matter what she's done.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.080
I won't ask you to.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.640
But there is a way to curb her.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.160
I should've strangled you,

40:30.280 --> 40:33.360
you useless, brainless,
misshapen toad!

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
What is it?

40:37.040 --> 40:40.040
Charlotte Wells,
I saved your life!

40:40.120 --> 40:43.680
And by my word,
you will be roasted on a spit!

40:46.400 --> 40:48.960
Charles!

40:49.000 --> 40:50.640
Charles...

40:50.760 --> 40:52.560
Charles.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.640
I spoke in anger.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.080
Please, Charles.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.800
I...

40:58.880 --> 41:00.160
You know I need you.

41:00.280 --> 41:01.600
I need you by my side.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.960
You're myyou're my lovely boy.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.080
Please!

41:07.880 --> 41:11.560
Let me out!

41:11.640 --> 41:13.600
Is it really so easy?

41:13.680 --> 41:16.160
One male relative
is all it takes.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.520
There now.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.400
The storm has passed.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.360
You must come with us.

41:32.440 --> 41:33.640
Where?

41:38.520 --> 41:39.760
Charles.

41:39.840 --> 41:40.960
Hands off me.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.880
Get off of me!

41:43.960 --> 41:46.880
I'm not going anywhere!

41:46.960 --> 41:48.880
This is my home!

41:48.960 --> 41:51.280
No, I'm your mother!

41:51.360 --> 41:55.840
I'm not leaving,
this is my house! Charles!

41:55.920 --> 41:58.360
I will not leave!

41:58.440 --> 42:00.760
Charles!

42:00.840 --> 42:02.680
Get off of me!

42:02.800 --> 42:05.160
Don't waste your tears.

42:05.280 --> 42:07.120
It's her judgment day.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.120
"I do freely confess"

42:11.200 --> 42:13.760
to the murders
of Justice Cunliffe,

42:13.840 --> 42:15.960
a harlot Miss Carter,

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
and to the wounding
of Miss Scanwell.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.520
I did these acts alone,

42:21.600 --> 42:26.480
spurred only by
my baleful nature.

42:26.520 --> 42:30.760
Damned by God and my fellow man,

42:30.840 --> 42:34.000
"I see no other path
but to take my own life."

42:59.200 --> 43:01.200
Here is hemlock.

43:01.320 --> 43:04.200
Here is the knife.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.320
I die as I lived.

44:17.880 --> 44:19.400
The law's rat.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.480
You sent my Margaret
to a butcher's slab.

44:25.520 --> 44:26.680
Please, I...

44:26.800 --> 44:28.640
Give me her body!

44:28.760 --> 44:30.200
You tell me where she is!

44:30.320 --> 44:31.040
I cannot.

44:31.120 --> 44:33.280
Give me Margaret Wells,

44:33.360 --> 44:35.280
so I can lay her to rest!

44:35.360 --> 44:36.640
You cannot.

44:37.600 --> 44:38.840
You cannot bury her

44:38.920 --> 44:40.920
'cause she is not dead.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.600
I spared her.

44:45.680 --> 44:48.880
I paid the hangman.

44:48.960 --> 44:51.680
She lives?

44:51.800 --> 44:54.320
She's on a transport ship

44:54.400 --> 44:56.920
bound for Virginia.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.040
She lives?

45:00.120 --> 45:02.040
If you speak, I will be hanged

45:02.120 --> 45:04.320
for insubordination.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.320
Tell no one.

45:06.400 --> 45:09.160
You spared her?

45:09.280 --> 45:12.320
I did.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.840
Now you spare me.

45:35.480 --> 45:38.080
Go and tell your family.

45:38.160 --> 45:40.560
You didn't waste much time.

45:40.640 --> 45:44.840
Your old missus is
still not in the ground.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.960
You cannot sting me,

45:47.000 --> 45:48.760
little fly.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.400
Hey,

45:53.480 --> 45:55.480
we've lost our house,

45:55.560 --> 45:58.000
you blabbing cow.

45:58.080 --> 46:00.320
Did you tell Nell
I wasn't pregnant?

46:00.400 --> 46:04.400
'Cause she spilled it to
Charles like it was soup.

46:04.480 --> 46:08.800
He's taken his house back
and we're cast out.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.680
So, thank you.

46:10.800 --> 46:13.320
Thank you.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.760
We're tavern whores.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.800
Who wants me silk?

46:29.480 --> 46:32.400
Come on, who's hard
enough for me?

46:32.480 --> 46:34.520
Ten shillings!

46:36.760 --> 46:38.080
What do you say, boys?

46:41.160 --> 46:42.480
Mrs. Quigley sent me.

46:42.560 --> 46:44.800
She's in urgent need
of your assistance.

46:44.880 --> 46:48.800
I don't give a damn
about Mrs. Quigley.

46:48.880 --> 46:51.480
But you're
a delectable distraction.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.640
She said the word "Spartan"
would make you come.

46:57.920 --> 47:00.840
Why don't you make me come?

47:00.920 --> 47:03.560
I'd like nothing better.

47:03.640 --> 47:05.160
Thirty guineas?

47:18.920 --> 47:19.920
Hey.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.040
Am I still just a dalliance?

47:26.160 --> 47:27.600
Amelia.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.120
Amelia.

47:36.760 --> 47:38.360
I've been a prig.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.480
We'll find rooms.

47:50.120 --> 47:52.320
We'll set up on our own.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.160
Are you with us, Harriet?

47:54.280 --> 47:56.280
What's a house anyway?

47:58.360 --> 47:59.880
It's the people.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.040
She's alive?

48:31.360 --> 48:34.400
No one can know,

48:34.480 --> 48:36.800
not even the girls.

48:36.880 --> 48:39.000
I'll kill her when I see her.

48:39.040 --> 48:41.440
I knew Ma was
too good for the noose.

48:43.680 --> 48:46.440
She can never
come back, can she?

48:48.400 --> 48:50.160
Returning carries
a sentence of death,

48:50.280 --> 48:51.840
so she's alive,

48:51.920 --> 48:53.760
but she's lost to us.

48:58.440 --> 49:02.200
She'll work some
trick to find us.

49:02.320 --> 49:04.000
She's Margaret Wells.

49:26.480 --> 49:28.000
There's nothing wrong with me.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.760
I'ml'm as sane as you.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.640
Please,

49:32.760 --> 49:36.960
send to the Marquess of Blayne.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.080
He'll release me

49:38.160 --> 49:40.040
and you'll be paid
for your pains.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.600
You'll be paid for your pains.

49:41.680 --> 49:42.880
Please.

49:42.960 --> 49:45.280
Please!

49:45.360 --> 49:46.640
Just tell him you know

49:46.760 --> 49:51.200
that his sister is mother
to a most unnatural bastard!

49:51.320 --> 49:54.560
There is incest between them!

49:54.640 --> 49:57.640
My sermon for today

49:57.760 --> 50:01.040
is in praise of God's justice,

50:01.120 --> 50:04.840
for He moves in strange

50:04.920 --> 50:08.000
and beautiful ways.
