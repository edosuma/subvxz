00:01.710 --> 00:05.131
THE DRAGON: In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.214 --> 00:10.428
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.595 --> 00:13.514
His name, Merlin.

00:49.133 --> 00:51.219
By the sacred laws vested in me,

00:52.136 --> 00:53.888
| pronounce you Guinevere,

00:54.764 --> 00:58.017
Queen of Camelot.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.627
(GASPS)

01:43.604 --> 01:45.231
Is everything all right, my lady?

01:49.902 --> 01:50.987
I'm fine.

01:52.822 --> 01:53.906
It's late.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.617
You should go to bed.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.079
Goodnight.

02:00.538 --> 02:01.706
Goodnight, Gwen.

02:46.584 --> 02:47.918
MORGAUSE: (WHISPERING) Sister.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.256
Sister.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.261
Sister.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.056
This way.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.437
Sister. This way.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.317
Sister.

03:17.948 --> 03:18.991
This way. This way.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.417
Hello, Sister.

03:30.336 --> 03:32.588
| can't tell you how good
it is to see you.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.174
| received your message.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.552
Tell me about these dreams
that are so troubling to you.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.933
They show a ceremony in Camelot.

03:45.434 --> 03:49.855
It's my serving girl, Gwen,
she sits beside Arthur on a throne.

03:52.483 --> 03:53.567
She's crowned queen.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.530
| see the same thing night after night.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.323
There are some dreams
that are so powerful,

03:59.407 --> 04:01.492
your healing bracelet
will not stop them.

04:02.368 --> 04:05.287
-It is a prophecy.
-How can that be?

04:06.497 --> 04:07.665
She's a servant.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.333
Uther would never allow Arthur
to marry her.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.127
There are many futures, Sister.

04:11.252 --> 04:15.423
Some are shrouded in mist
and others are clear as cut glass.

04:16.005 --> 04:19.885
But your gift is powerful,
and this vision cannot be ignored.

04:19.969 --> 04:22.263
You cannot allow
this serving girl to take

04:22.346 --> 04:24.348
your rightful place upon the throne.

04:26.016 --> 04:31.230
Whatever relationship exists
between Arthur and Gwen,

04:33.941 --> 04:35.776
you must destroy it.

04:44.994 --> 04:47.663
(GASPS) You startled me.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.666
You're up early this morning.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.086
I... I couldn't sleep.
| went for a walk.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.506
-Did you want to change?
-No.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.303
Have you spoken to Arthur recently?

05:04.472 --> 05:06.140
| saw him yesterday in the market.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.272
-It must be hard.
-What's that?

05:15.691 --> 05:17.234
Hiding your feelings for him.

05:18.402 --> 05:19.695
I'm not sure what you mean.

05:20.362 --> 05:24.241
| know how you feel about Arthur
and how he feels about you.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.828
Do you deny it?

05:36.629 --> 05:39.590
It's such a shame you can't be more open
about your feelings for each other.

05:41.759 --> 05:44.053
If you'll excuse me, my lady.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.808
What news from the northern borders?

05:50.518 --> 05:53.103
There've been a number
of minor skirmishes.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.607
You think Odin is testing our defenses?

06:01.028 --> 06:02.363
Arthur, are you listening?

06:03.405 --> 06:07.117
-What's that?
-What on earth is wrong with you?

06:07.826 --> 06:10.371
Hmm. Nothing. Sorry.

06:17.253 --> 06:18.420
(DOOR OPENING)

06:19.755 --> 06:22.174
-Morgana.
-Arthur, am I disturbing you?

06:22.591 --> 06:23.801
No. Come in.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.514
To what do I owe this pleasure?

06:29.598 --> 06:32.268
Well, I was worried about you.
You weren't yourself at dinner.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.522
-Just a bit tired.
-Really?

06:38.399 --> 06:40.150
| thought
the reason you were so distracted

06:40.234 --> 06:43.487
had something to do with the fact
that Gwen was in the room.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.407
| have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.783
Come on, Arthur.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.160
Why can't you admit,
you have feelings for her?

06:50.244 --> 06:51.662
A blind man could see it.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.417
Is it really that obvious?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.669
It's only so obvious to me because

06:59.753 --> 07:01.380
| know Gwen also has feelings for you.

07:02.006 --> 07:03.173
Has she said something?

07:03.299 --> 07:04.800
She speaks of you all the time.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.093
What did she say?

07:06.468 --> 07:09.221
You're already arrogant enough.
| will flatter you no further.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.019
Poor girl,

07:16.020 --> 07:18.439
| fear she doesn't know what to do
with herself when she's around you.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.149
She's not alone.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.360
| have such feelings for her,

07:23.444 --> 07:25.070
and yet I know nothing can
ever come of them.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.824
If it's Gwen who you desire,
why do you deny yourself?

07:29.408 --> 07:30.451
Because she's a servant.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.411
My father would have me marry
for the good of the kingdom.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.705
Uther knows nothing of love.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.041
You are the future king.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.043
You must set your own rules.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.880
Besides, he doesn't have to find out.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.802
You should spend some time with Gwen.

07:49.595 --> 07:50.804
| know she'd like that.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.855
Arthur wishes to spend the day with me?

07:59.938 --> 08:01.231
| thought you'd be happy.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.151
It isn't that simple.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.778
If anyone were to find out...

08:06.070 --> 08:07.154
What if someone sees us?

08:07.237 --> 08:08.989
I'll take you to meet him outside
the city.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.867
Arthur's willing to take the risk
if you are.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.123
-Should I tell him you won't meet him?
-No.

08:20.793 --> 08:23.170
You forget, he's Prince Arthur,

08:23.253 --> 08:25.255
and that he can be
a spoiled, arrogant brat.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.383
-(CHUCKLES)
-Sorry.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.807
-You like him.
-Yes.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.433
-He likes you.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.894
Isn't that all that really matters?

08:40.895 --> 08:43.357
-I suppose it is.
-Then I will come back in the morning.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.633
-Will there be anything else?
-No, that'll be all.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.559
| was hoping it might be possible
to be relieved of my duties tomorrow.

09:19.852 --> 09:20.894
Really?

09:21.729 --> 09:22.938
And why is that?

09:24.481 --> 09:26.316
| fear I'm sickening with a fever.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.320
-Of course.
-Thank you.

09:41.373 --> 09:44.334
(BELLS TOLLING)

09:47.421 --> 09:48.630
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

09:57.973 --> 09:59.016
What?

10:03.020 --> 10:04.229
You look lovely.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.120
-(LAUGHING)
-Shh.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.207
MERLIN: Caw-caw!

10:25.501 --> 10:26.794
(LAUGHING)

10:31.673 --> 10:32.841
Guinevere, you look...

10:37.221 --> 10:39.264
| think he's trying to say
you look nice.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.434
Thank you, Merlin. That'll be all.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.394
Have fun.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.292
It's such a beautiful day,
| was wondering if you might

11:07.376 --> 11:08.585
join me for a ride.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.922
| have council matters to attend to.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.343
It's just, I get to spend so little time
with you these days.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.555
Time together is

11:21.515 --> 11:23.350
SO precious to me.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.396
You're right.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.773
We don't spend enough time together.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.276
The council can wait.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.574
You are not here as a servant.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.872
It feels different, doesn't it?
Being away from Camelot.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.042
| love Camelot more than I can say,

11:50.252 --> 11:51.253
but when I'm there,

11:52.671 --> 11:53.755
sometimes I...

11:55.090 --> 11:57.926
feel I can hardly breathe,
everyone expects so much of me.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.345
Being here with you?

12:01.138 --> 12:02.180
| can be myself.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.310
| like that, you being yourself.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.022
Sometimes I dream of leaving Camelot.

12:10.355 --> 12:13.150
Really? Where would you go?

12:15.193 --> 12:16.236
| don't know.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.823
Somewhere where nobody knew who I was.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.994
-I'd get some land and become a farmer.
-(LAUGHING)

12:26.288 --> 12:28.916
| can hardly see you toiling away
in the fields all day.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.043
Obviously I'd take Merlin with me,
he can do all the hard work.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.587
(LAUGHING) I'm sure he'd love that.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.632
Thank you.

12:39.343 --> 12:41.845
I'm glad you persuaded me to come.
We must do this again.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.555
I'd like that very much.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.141
Come on, I'll race you.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.309
(SPURRING ON HORSE)

12:53.023 --> 12:54.900
We should be heading back
to Camelot soon.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.946
We could stay a while longer.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.199
Don't know when we'll have the chance
to do this again.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.702
Perhaps when you become a farmer
we can be together more often.

13:06.745 --> 13:07.955
That's just a dream.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.209
| fear

13:13.460 --> 13:15.504
| will never leave Camelot.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.297
Stay still.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.467
Is it bandits?

13:27.391 --> 13:28.433
(GASPS)

13:29.685 --> 13:30.727
A wasp.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.046
(GASPS)

14:00.424 --> 14:01.466
Arthur!

14:24.990 --> 14:26.658
| thought you'd be furious.

14:26.742 --> 14:30.829
| was young once, I'm more than familiar
with the temptations of serving girls.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.789
I'm sorry I kept it from you.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.791
| thought it for the best.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.626
No serious harm has been done.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.463
| can't allow it to continue, obviously.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.591
-What are you talking about?
-You can never see this girl again.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.260
You just said
that no harm had been done.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.929
You've had your fun,
now it must come to an end.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.932
What does it matter,
that Guinevere's a servant?

14:53.310 --> 14:54.644
The survival of Camelot

14:54.728 --> 14:57.856
depends on forging an alliance
through your marriage.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.817
But I can't marry someone who
| don't have feelings for.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.569
Your first duty is to Camelot.

15:02.652 --> 15:07.240
- I care about her.
-I cannot allow this. I forbid it.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.576
You can't forbid my feelings
any more than I can.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.703
| won't deny them any longer,
| love her.

15:15.332 --> 15:16.500
| love Guinevere.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.172
You leave me no choice,
she's banished from the city.

15:23.840 --> 15:24.841
You can't do that.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.176
She has three days to leave.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.845
-To return is on pain of death.
-She has nowhere to go!

15:28.929 --> 15:30.555
Her, her life is in Camelot.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.682
You have caused this to happen, Arthur.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.020
My decision is final.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.273
Please, do not banish her.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.819
| give you my solemn word
that I'll never see her again.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.114
You have made it clear to me
that you cannot

15:47.197 --> 15:50.033
-control your feelings for this girl.
-No! I...

15:52.828 --> 15:54.454
This is for your own good.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.178
How did Uther know where to find you?

16:10.262 --> 16:12.848
| don't know. You were the only person,
who knew where we were.

16:13.265 --> 16:14.724
| didn't tell him.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.394
Oh, maybe something you said
gave it away.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.895
| didn't say anything.

16:19.396 --> 16:22.107
You know, Merlin, you couldn't keep
a secret if your life depended on it!

16:22.190 --> 16:23.191
You'd be surprised!

16:24.317 --> 16:25.402
What's that supposed to mean?

16:27.696 --> 16:28.738
Nothing.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.246
What are you going to do?

16:37.455 --> 16:38.498
| don't know.

16:43.211 --> 16:44.421
Leave us, Merlin.

16:56.766 --> 16:57.809
Arthur, I heard what happened.

16:57.893 --> 17:00.103
-I can't tell you how sorry I am.
-It's all my fault.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.855
You're not to blame.

17:01.938 --> 17:05.108
I... I can't accept that I may
never see her again.

17:06.818 --> 17:07.903
Uther has banished her.

17:08.737 --> 17:10.946
-Surely you have no choice.
-There are always choices.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.700
What will you do?

17:17.204 --> 17:18.538
I'll leave with her.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.582
You're leaving Camelot?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.044
You'd give up your rights to
the throne!

17:25.795 --> 17:27.839
One day we will return to
Camelot together,

17:29.132 --> 17:33.511
and Guinevere will take her place on
the throne beside me.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.486
There is so much to do.

17:50.779 --> 17:53.156
I'll have to sell everything
| can't take with me.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.409
And of course I need to find
a new maid for Morgana.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.245
-Gwen.
-Do you know anyone suitable?

17:58.328 --> 18:00.288
Gwen, stop it.

18:01.831 --> 18:02.999
Where will you go?

18:11.341 --> 18:12.467
| don't know.

18:15.470 --> 18:19.015
I've spent my whole life in Camelot,
it's all I know.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.186
Everything I care about is here.

18:24.187 --> 18:27.357
-I have nothing else.
-I'll think of something.

18:29.359 --> 18:32.279
- I promise.
-(SIGHS DEEPLY)

18:59.514 --> 19:00.765
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

19:03.560 --> 19:04.644
Enter.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.899
Morgana.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.069
| was concerned about you, my lord.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.072
You weren't at dinner.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.241
Oh, I had no appetite.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.161
You're worried about Arthur.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.830
| do not understand

19:23.913 --> 19:27.834
his feelings for this girl,
she's a servant.

19:31.546 --> 19:34.883
-It is strange that...
-What?

19:37.177 --> 19:39.054
Arthur tells me everything and he's

19:39.596 --> 19:42.182
never expressed any feelings for Gwen

19:42.432 --> 19:44.351
and suddenly he's declaring his love
for her.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.816
What are you saying, Morgana?

19:52.776 --> 19:55.445
-I'm sure there's an explanation.
-Speak your mind.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.784
You yourself have noticed
Arthur's strange mood.

20:03.745 --> 20:07.374
It's almost as though
he's been enchanted.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.471
What's going on?

20:22.680 --> 20:24.057
My father has ordered

20:24.140 --> 20:26.184
-my chambers to be searched.
-What for?

20:27.977 --> 20:29.979
You think I have a girl hiding in there?

20:34.150 --> 20:35.193
What's that?

20:36.986 --> 20:37.987
Is it magical?

20:38.738 --> 20:41.908
| believe so. These are the symbols
of the Old Religion.

20:42.325 --> 20:43.952
Could it be used to cast an enchantment?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.788
That would be one use of such
a poultice.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.207
This enchantment,
could it cause someone to fall in love?

20:49.833 --> 20:51.126
It is entirely possible.

20:51.209 --> 20:53.086
May I ask where it was found?

20:53.253 --> 20:55.004
It was discovered in Arthur's chambers.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.800
Find Morgana's maid
and bring her to me immediately.

21:05.974 --> 21:07.016
What is it, Merlin?

21:07.100 --> 21:09.436
| just saw some guards dragging
Gwen into the palace.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.193
You recognize it?

21:20.196 --> 21:22.740
-I've never seen it before in my life.
-Really?

21:23.741 --> 21:27.287
| believe you planted it in
Arthur's chambers to enchant him.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.165
That's not true.

21:30.248 --> 21:34.377
Why else would Arthur fall in love
with someone like you?

21:35.712 --> 21:38.548
| don't expect someone like you
to understand that.

21:38.882 --> 21:39.883
(GASPS)

21:40.049 --> 21:41.092
My lord!

21:41.759 --> 21:43.970
Gwen has always been
a loyal and trusted servant!

21:44.053 --> 21:45.680
| have no doubt she's feigned loyalty

21:45.763 --> 21:48.349
while using her position
to get close to my son.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.310
(DOORS OPENING)

21:51.186 --> 21:52.353
What is the meaning of this?

21:52.437 --> 21:56.524
This poultice was found under
your pillow.

21:56.858 --> 21:58.943
Some kind of love charm.
You were under its spell.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.695
-That's ridiculous.
-What would you know?

22:00.778 --> 22:03.114
Because I know how I feel.
I'm not enchanted.

22:03.198 --> 22:05.325
So can you tell me how it came
to be in your room?

22:06.743 --> 22:08.995
| don't know, but I don't believe
Guinevere put it there.

22:09.078 --> 22:12.707
Until its spell is broken, I can't take
anything you say as the truth.

22:13.082 --> 22:16.002
Her father consorted with sorcerers.

22:16.544 --> 22:20.131
My father was a good and innocent man
and you executed him!

22:20.882 --> 22:24.344
So you would seek your revenge
by enchanting my son?

22:24.427 --> 22:26.596
-No!
-My lord, whatever this poultice is,

22:26.679 --> 22:29.265
| don't believe
that Gwen is responsible for magic.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.518
| don't care what you believe, Gaius.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.686
Arthur is under her spell.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.189
It's the only rational explanation
for his behavior!

22:36.272 --> 22:39.359
Father, you have to see reason.
Guinevere has done nothing wrong.

22:39.442 --> 22:42.904
She has been found guilty
of using magic and enchantments.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.739
She will be burnt at the stake.

22:45.323 --> 22:46.533
-No.
-Restrain him!

22:46.616 --> 22:47.784
You can't do this!

22:47.992 --> 22:50.787
My lord!
At least give Gwen a fair trial!

22:50.870 --> 22:53.540
| have all the evidence I need.

22:53.623 --> 22:56.876
I'm begging youl!
We will leave Camelot and never return!

Just, just let us go!

22:58.711 --> 23:01.256
| relinquish my entitlement to
the throne!

23:06.052 --> 23:08.388
My son would never do that.

23:10.306 --> 23:13.309
It is proof beyond doubt
that you are enchanted.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.437
- I will never forgive you for this.
-She will die.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.606
The enchantment will be broken.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.484
You'll see I was right.

My father has me under constant watch.

There are guards outside,

-I thought you might be hungry.
-I can't even think of eating.

24:59.874 --> 25:01.417
How is Arthur?

25:03.670 --> 25:06.214
He wants me to let you know
that he will do everything he can

25:06.297 --> 25:07.632
to convince Uther that you're innocent.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.843
He won't stop until you're released.

25:10.927 --> 25:13.262
You and I both know
that Uther will not change his mind.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.683
When I am gone, will you take care
of him for me, Merlin?

25:16.766 --> 25:19.185
No, you can't give up hope.
There is still time.

25:19.268 --> 25:20.311
To do what?

25:20.395 --> 25:22.605

who really planted the poultice.

25:23.523 --> 25:26.275

After I was sentenced to death,
| was being led out.

25:40.832 --> 25:43.584
| looked back.
| swear, Morgana was smiling.

25:46.421 --> 25:47.922
You probably think I'm mad.

25:48.923 --> 25:51.300
No, I don't doubt.

25:51.968 --> 25:53.469
| can no longer trust her.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.430
I've started to wonder if it wasn't
a coincidence

25:55.513 --> 25:57.432
that Uther and Morgana found us in
the woods.

26:09.944 --> 26:11.070
Morgana?

26:11.320 --> 26:14.073
Uther'll never believe
that Morgana's responsible.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.160
Perhaps Arthur will talk him round.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.287
Uther thinks Arthur's enchanted.

26:19.370 --> 26:22.331
Anything that Arthur does
is going to strengthen that belief.

26:22.957 --> 26:24.834
| fear that's not going to save Gwen.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.757
If we can't expose the true sorcerer,

26:32.508 --> 26:34.218
then we must invent one.

Mmm?

26:45.021 --> 26:48.024

in Arthur's chambers?

26:49.025 --> 26:50.860
Uther would have no choice
but to release Gwen.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.278
And do you know of a sorcerer

26:52.361 --> 26:54.864

to get caught doing such a thing?

26:56.783 --> 26:57.825
Me.

26:59.911 --> 27:03.164
So if I disguise myself,
it won't matter if I'm caught.

27:03.247 --> 27:06.876

and then just change back into myself.

27:08.419 --> 27:12.882

has just vanished into thin air.

Well, no matter
how you disguise yourself,

27:18.137 --> 27:20.890
Not if I'm 80 years old.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.435

27:24.811 --> 27:27.396
Aging spells are notoriously difficult
and unpredictable.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.899
If the spell doesn't hold,
you'll be exposed.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.275
If I don't do something,
Gwen's going to die,

27:31.359 --> 27:33.319
and I am not going to let that happen.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.448
Can you make a poultice identical to

37:38.632 --> 37:39.675
What is it?

37:43.303 --> 37:44.930
There are

37:45.013 --> 37:48.308
other crimes I wish to confess.

37:48.392 --> 37:49.435
(CHUCKLES)

37:51.145 --> 37:52.604
What difference does it make?

37:52.688 --> 37:55.858
You're about to be burnt at the stake.
We can't execute you twice.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.751
(DRUMS CONTINUE BEATING)

39:07.221 --> 39:10.766
You have been found guilty of
using magic and enchantments.

39:11.308 --> 39:13.936
In accordance with our law,
you will be burned at the stake.

39:16.396 --> 39:20.984
Let this serve as a lesson to
all those who seek to destroy Camelot.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.785
A curse upon you all!

39:31.328 --> 39:34.081
| will have my revenge!

39:35.958 --> 39:38.001
-Are you all right, Gaius?
-I'm fine, Arthur.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.380
(CASTING SPELL)

39:42.839 --> 39:45.717
(CROWD SCREAMING)

39:52.516 --> 39:53.559
After him!

40:08.490 --> 40:09.950
(GUARDS APPROACHING)

40:28.218 --> 40:31.013
-Merlin, where's the sorcerer?
-(IN OLD MAN'S VOICE) He...

40:31.138 --> 40:33.181
(CLEARING THROAT) Um...

40:33.932 --> 40:35.976
He went that way.

40:38.020 --> 40:40.397
Sound the warning bell.
Search the entire palace.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.481
| want him found.

40:41.565 --> 40:43.734
Are you telling me you let him
run straight past you?

40:44.860 --> 40:46.945
(STAMMERS) He was too fast for me.

40:47.029 --> 40:48.488
He's a doddery old man.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.783
This is what happens when you
spend all day in the tavern.

40:53.035 --> 40:56.204
-What?
-Perhaps mucking out my horses

40:56.330 --> 40:57.706
will help sober you up.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.262
Gwen.

41:13.055 --> 41:15.098
(SIGHS HAPPILY)

41:19.311 --> 41:21.730
| can't tell you how relieved I am
that you've been pardoned.

41:27.235 --> 41:31.031
| begged Uther to release you
but he wouldn't listen to reason.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.616
I'm sure you did all you could.

41:34.868 --> 41:36.078
-Mmm-hmm.

41:49.091 --> 41:50.676
-(GASPS)
-Sorry.

41:51.426 --> 41:52.594
Didn't mean to startle you.

41:53.553 --> 41:56.890
Now, my father believes that
my feelings for you are

41:56.973 --> 41:59.351
a result of an enchantment.

41:59.434 --> 42:01.561
If he's to see any sign that
that isn't the case,

42:01.770 --> 42:02.854
then he'll banish you from Camelot.

42:03.397 --> 42:06.274
And are your feelings for me
the result of an enchantment?

42:06.358 --> 42:07.859
Oh, we both know that's a lie.

42:09.820 --> 42:12.322
But I think it would be safer for you

42:13.448 --> 42:16.159
if we let others continue to believe it.

42:18.787 --> 42:20.247
What you said to your father...

42:21.790 --> 42:24.584
Would you really have given up
your place on the throne for me?

42:24.668 --> 42:25.711
Still would.

42:27.295 --> 42:30.298
-Your place is here in Camelot.
-My place is with you.

42:31.591 --> 42:32.843
This isn't just about us.

42:33.719 --> 42:36.096
You must stay for
the sake of your people.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.849
You will be a great king.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.477
And then you can change
these ridiculous customs.

42:46.481 --> 42:49.317
| promise you that when I am king
things will be different.

42:51.153 --> 42:52.237
We can be together.

42:53.864 --> 42:55.657
| will count the days until then.

43:03.457 --> 43:04.958
| should go.

43:18.930 --> 43:20.140
Ah, Merlin.

43:20.348 --> 43:22.642
It's good to see you looking
like your old self.

43:24.186 --> 43:26.730
-I'm covered in horse dung.
-Precisely.

43:31.777 --> 43:35.155
Arthur seems to think
| spent the day in the tavern.

43:36.698 --> 43:38.241
| don't suppose you, uh,

43:39.201 --> 43:40.869
you know where he got that idea?

43:46.625 --> 43:48.168
| really can't imagine.

43:51.296 --> 43:52.589
Oh, and Merlin?

43:56.843 --> 43:58.720
You might want to take a bath.

44:01.556 --> 44:02.557
(SNIFFS)

44:02.682 --> 44:03.725
(EXHALES WITH DISGUST)

44:04.559 --> 44:05.602
THE DRAGON: Merlin.

44:06.853 --> 44:08.396
Let the tournament begin.

44:08.939 --> 44:11.608
The only rule is, there are no rules.

44:12.234 --> 44:14.110
-Ahh!
-He is using magic.

44:15.695 --> 44:17.739
If Uther finds out
he'll have him killed.

44:18.073 --> 44:19.825
You need to learn to use your magic
for good.

44:19.908 --> 44:21.159
That is its true purpose.

44:21.243 --> 44:23.453
| am not going to apologize
for who I am!

44:24.412 --> 44:27.415
It's time those with magic fought back.
