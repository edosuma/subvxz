GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:02.735 --> 00:04.871
-I killed people, Giles.
-I've not forgotten.

00:04.971 --> 00:07.141
When you brought me here,
I thought it was to kill me.

00:07.174 --> 00:10.178
Instead, you go
all Dumbledore on me.

00:10.211 --> 00:13.314
I don't want to go back home
just so I can screw up again.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.914
What exactly
are you afraid of?

00:14.948 --> 00:18.385
What if I go all veiny
and homicidal again?
And what if--

00:18.419 --> 00:19.820
They won't take you back?

00:19.853 --> 00:23.356
You turn this nice lady's ex
into a giant worm monster?

00:23.390 --> 00:25.559
You wish it, I dish it.
I thought we were clear on this.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.394
-It's what you wanted, right?
-Tell me what happened.

00:27.428 --> 00:30.698
-Why does a man do what
he mustn't? For her.
-Your soul.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.301
You got your soul back.

00:37.036 --> 00:39.606
MAN:
I'll call you when
I get there. Okay?

00:39.640 --> 00:42.176
Woman On P.A.: Arriving
passengers on Flight 201...
They said they'd meet us.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.844
Look, there they are.
may claim their bags
at carousel two.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.780
Hey. Hi!
Hi, honey!

00:47.814 --> 00:49.950
How you doin'?
Pretty good.

00:49.982 --> 00:52.552
And how's it goin'
with you two?
Girls: Hi, Dad.

00:52.585 --> 00:54.921
Woman On P.A.:
Flight 324,
nonstop service to--

00:54.954 --> 00:56.590
Get goin'!
Hey!

00:56.624 --> 00:59.026
Man! See what you did?
Will you kids stop acting up?

00:59.058 --> 01:01.195
Really?
(Laughs)

01:01.228 --> 01:03.430
Woman:
Right here.
(People Chattering)

01:09.769 --> 01:11.739
You think
she'll get
the sign?

01:11.772 --> 01:14.942
"Get the sign?"
I don't think she's
gonna see the sign.

01:14.974 --> 01:17.144
Why is it so pale?

01:17.177 --> 01:21.149
I used yellow crayon.
It was a thing from when
I talked to Wil on the bluff.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.284
I hope she gets it.

01:24.317 --> 01:26.387
Oh, tell us again
what you said.

01:26.420 --> 01:31.625
Well, I was talkin' from
my heart. And I knew Evil Willow
wasn't really ready to--

01:31.658 --> 01:34.295
You were kidding?
Mm-hmm.
A little bit.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.664
We've heard the crayon speech
a few times. Not that it's
not great of course, but--

01:37.698 --> 01:39.932
I saved the world
with talking
from my mouth.

01:39.966 --> 01:42.503
My mouth
saved the world.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.406
Uh-huh.
I'm getting nervous.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.609
Are you nervous?
Yeah, it--

01:48.641 --> 01:50.610
it's gonna be weird
seeing her.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.680
What do you say to someone
in this situation?

01:52.712 --> 01:55.283
I'm gonna say,
"Hi, Willow."

01:55.316 --> 01:59.686
Come on. You're saying
it's not gonna be
the least bit strange?

01:59.719 --> 02:04.192
We saw her kill someone.
She was about to kill Dawn.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.760
And Giles wouldn't
let her leave unless
she completed that...

02:06.793 --> 02:08.627
whatever
recovery course.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.330
Right.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.603
-Right?
-She kind of didn't finish.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.771
She didn't finish?

02:17.805 --> 02:20.341
She didn't finish
being not evil?

02:20.373 --> 02:22.876
He-He said it was
really important
she come back early,

02:22.909 --> 02:25.812
and that she was
doing really well,
and we shouldn't worry.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.881
You guys, I just
noticed something.

02:27.914 --> 02:32.853
-What?
-Everyone's off the plane,
so where's Willow?

02:37.224 --> 02:39.793
Man:
I'll call you when
I get there. Okay?

02:39.826 --> 02:42.329
Woman On P.A.: Arriving
passengers on Flight 201...
They said they'd meet us.

02:42.362 --> 02:45.031
Oh, look, there they are.

at carousel two.

02:45.064 --> 02:48.034
Hey. Hi!
Hi, honey!

02:48.067 --> 02:50.304
How you doin'?
Pretty good.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.840
And how's it goin'
with you two?
Girls: Hi, Dad.

02:52.939 --> 02:55.141
Woman On P.A.:
Flight 324,
nonstop service to--

02:55.175 --> 02:56.843
Get goin'!
Hey!

02:56.877 --> 03:00.514
Man! See what you did?
Will you kids stop acting up?

03:00.548 --> 03:03.050
(People Chattering)

03:17.030 --> 03:19.966
Welcome home, me.

03:24.305 --> 03:27.574
(Theme music plays)

04:19.192 --> 04:22.028
(Dog Barking)
(Paint Spraying)

04:33.941 --> 04:36.677
DEMON:
All alone.

04:41.449 --> 04:45.985
Are you frightened
to be all alone?

04:46.019 --> 04:47.687
Hey, is s-somebody there?

04:47.721 --> 04:53.526
DEMON:
The wind talks when
you're alone. (Laughs)

04:53.560 --> 04:56.329
You better clear out
whoever you are!

04:56.363 --> 04:59.367
-(Screeches)
-(Screams)

05:18.519 --> 05:20.153
Buffy?

05:23.591 --> 05:25.358
Hello?

06:22.550 --> 06:26.653
(Willow Thinking)
 (Glass Breaking)
 Tara? (Sobbing)

06:56.683 --> 06:59.487
-(Dog Barking)
-(Door Slams)

07:02.122 --> 07:05.192
Dawn?
Did I hear the door?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.362
He absolutely put her
on the plane in London.

07:42.394 --> 07:44.331
So she got off
at Chicago when
they stopped?

07:44.363 --> 07:47.300
(Sighs)
She could've caught a flight
anywhere from there.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.836
Maybe she doubled back--

07:49.870 --> 07:52.139
Got off the plane in London
after Giles left.

07:52.172 --> 07:57.944
Well, if she's doing that--
ducking Giles--
then she's evil, right?

07:57.978 --> 08:02.048
Well, I've avoided Giles
tons of times. It just meant
I was lazy, not evil.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.050
I hope you're right.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.654
Because defeating Lazy Willow--
probably less hard.

08:07.687 --> 08:11.458
We should check
the messages, see if
she tried to reach us here.

08:11.490 --> 08:12.793
That's a good idea.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.326
(Dog Barking)
(Slams)

08:14.360 --> 08:17.630
(Object Drops)
(Footsteps)

08:17.665 --> 08:20.167
What was that?
Upstairs.

08:20.199 --> 08:23.435
Willow?
That you?

08:29.910 --> 08:31.879
BUFFY:
Definitely not
up there.

08:31.911 --> 08:35.481
(Sighs)
She didn't leave
a message.

08:35.514 --> 08:38.350
I checked with Giles
again too.
Hasn't heard from her.

08:38.384 --> 08:40.821
Is he throwing a tasteful
British wiggins?

08:40.854 --> 08:44.825
Oh, with extra wig.
He's blaming himself
pretty hard.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.894
Like he should've known
she wasn't ready
to come back.

08:47.927 --> 08:50.597
And I kept telling him,
you know, it wasn't his fault.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.865
Maybe it's something about us
she couldn't face.

08:52.899 --> 08:56.003
Like she didn't think
we were ready to forgive her.
I get that.

08:56.036 --> 09:01.107
So Giles is blaming Giles,
and we're blaming us?

09:01.140 --> 09:02.942
Is anyone gonna blame
Willow?

09:04.311 --> 09:06.513
Oh, don't give me
shock face.

09:06.546 --> 09:10.783
I mean, will anyone around here
ever start asking for help
when they need it?

09:10.817 --> 09:13.086
Look, if Willow flipped out,
it's her bad.

09:13.120 --> 09:18.557
We can only be here for her
so much, if she won't be,
you know, here.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.985
(Grunts)

10:07.006 --> 10:11.979
Hello, I'm calling for Giles.
Uh, Mr. Giles?

10:12.011 --> 10:15.014
Right.
Council meeting all day.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.150
No, no. I know he can't
be reached there.

10:18.184 --> 10:20.419
Thanks. Bye.

10:20.452 --> 10:23.123
(Replaces Receiver)
(Exhales)

10:35.201 --> 10:37.303
MAN:
Morning, Dave!
Mornin'!

10:39.206 --> 10:40.908
(Bell Ringing)

10:42.509 --> 10:44.476
Anya.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.312
Anya, don't!
Don't run away.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.782
What are you doing here?

10:48.816 --> 10:52.219
I thought you were with Giles
studying how to not kill people.

10:52.251 --> 10:55.121
I just got back.
"Just got back"
as in you're all better?

10:55.154 --> 10:58.658
Or "just got back"
to bring about a fiery
apocalypse of death?

10:58.692 --> 11:03.462
Neither.
But I-I have been studying,
working real hard.

11:03.495 --> 11:05.164
And I-I'm gonna be fine.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.466
Oh. Good.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.202
'Cause I-I remember
the last time you said that.

11:10.236 --> 11:14.707
I've spent a lot of time
since then cleaning the debris
out of my ex-livelihood.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.342
Stuff like that.

11:16.375 --> 11:20.480
Yeah, I--
I want to help any way
I can with that.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.049
I--I feel really responsible.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.985
You "feel" really responsible?

11:25.018 --> 11:30.090
You are really responsible.
I-I know I hurt you
and--and everyone,

11:30.123 --> 11:32.325
and I-I'm sorry.

11:32.359 --> 11:36.764
Here's something you should know
about vengeance demons:
We don't groove with the sorry.

11:36.797 --> 11:41.067
We prefer, "Oh, God!
Please stop hitting me
with my own rib bones."

11:41.100 --> 11:45.205
Go on.
Say whatever you want--
Rib bones and so forth.

11:45.238 --> 11:48.508
I--I deserve it.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.576
And you won't mind?
(Mouths Word) No.

11:50.610 --> 11:54.547
Well, then that's no fun.
Sorry.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.585
(Anya Sighs)

12:11.932 --> 12:15.903
So, um, where is everyone
these days?

12:15.936 --> 12:18.437
Well, I'm back in
my own apartment.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.307
And, of course,
vengeance takes me
all over the world.

12:21.341 --> 12:25.111
I was in Brazil yesterday.
They love their soccer.

12:25.144 --> 12:27.547
And... the others?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.981
Dawn and,

12:29.015 --> 12:33.253
uh, Xander,
Buffy?

12:33.286 --> 12:36.722
You haven't seen them?
Not so much.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.625
Huh.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.260
I guess they're still mad
at you.

12:41.293 --> 12:45.398
They've been a little
temperamental lately,
just between you and me.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.335
We had this little mix-up
a few days ago and--

12:48.368 --> 12:51.804
That sounds great.
So, um, where do you think
they'd be?

12:51.838 --> 12:55.008
Oh. At the new high school,
probably.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.509
Everyone's all about
the high school.

12:57.543 --> 13:00.179
Buffy's got some kind of job
there helping junior deviants.

13:00.212 --> 13:04.484
Spike's insane in the basement.
Xander's there doing
construction on the new gym.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.820
Uh, Spike's what
in the what-ment?

13:06.854 --> 13:08.989
Insane. Base.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.423
Xander does construction.

13:11.457 --> 13:15.128
He likes to start early,
so he's probably there by now.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.808
Xander?

13:29.842 --> 13:32.511
Xander, you down there?

13:59.206 --> 14:01.240
No skin.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.676
(Inhales)
Tough to look at.

14:03.710 --> 14:08.380
And yet my eyes
refuse to look away.
Stupid eyes.

14:08.414 --> 14:11.583
(Sighs)
I found it first thing
this morning.

14:11.618 --> 14:16.023
I gave my crew the day off,
and I called you right away.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.591
I gotta get a job where I don't
get called right away for
this stuff.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.428
(Clattering)
(Panting)

14:22.461 --> 14:25.865
Yeah, I know exactly what
you're thinking:

14:25.899 --> 14:28.467
Maybe Willow is back.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.409
(Chattering)

14:39.111 --> 14:42.381
(Bell Rings)

15:10.509 --> 15:12.578
Out!
This is my place!

15:12.611 --> 15:16.649
You need permission to be here!
You need a special slip
with a stamp.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.485
Spike? My God, I--

15:19.519 --> 15:22.088
You go off and you try
to wall up the bad parts...

15:22.121 --> 15:23.956
and put your heart back in
where it fell out.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.557
You call yourself finished,
but you're not.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.793
You're worse
than ever,
you are.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.571
You went away.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.807
You've been gone since--

15:40.840 --> 15:44.977
Yeah.
I-I needed to go,
but--

15:45.011 --> 15:46.678
but I'm back now.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.981
And I found--

15:49.015 --> 15:53.186
There's a body.
Tragedy.

15:53.220 --> 15:56.588
-Is there blood?
-Uh, yeah.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.959
And I can't find Buffy
or Xander or Dawn,

15:59.993 --> 16:03.330
and there's this thing
killing people--

16:03.363 --> 16:06.865
And the victim was...
skinned.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.467
Wh-What could do that?

16:08.500 --> 16:13.539
You did it once.
I heard about it.

16:13.572 --> 16:17.543
Anything other--
other than me?

16:19.145 --> 16:21.213
Look at you--

16:21.248 --> 16:25.485
glowing.

16:25.518 --> 16:29.121
What's a word
means "glowing"?
Gotta rhyme.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.192
-Spike?
-Oh, uh, no.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.461
Uh--Uh, I should hide.
Hide from you.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.197
Hide my face.
You know what I did.

16:38.230 --> 16:41.701
What you did?
You didn't do anything.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.735
Did you?

16:43.769 --> 16:46.405
Everyone's talking to me.

16:46.438 --> 16:49.808
No one's talking to each other.

16:49.841 --> 16:53.179
Spike, please try
to listen to me.

16:53.212 --> 16:56.716
Someone isn't here.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.851
Button, button.
Who's got the button?

16:59.885 --> 17:02.754
My money's on the witch.

17:07.460 --> 17:11.198
We can't use the blueprints
to find our way around
down here.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.432
It's like the walls move
or something.

17:15.434 --> 17:17.604
SPIKE:
Out! This is my place!

17:17.636 --> 17:21.307
I think I hear him.
You need permission! You need
a special slip with a stamp.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.212
And put your heart back in
where it fell out.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.881
You call yourself finished,
but you're not.

17:28.914 --> 17:30.583
You're worse off than ever,
you are.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.520
Spike?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.423
Spike.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.096
You went away.

17:44.131 --> 17:48.800
You've been gone since--
The church.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.037
You scared me
a little.

17:51.069 --> 17:53.905
I didn't--

17:53.940 --> 17:57.109
-I didn't know what to think.
-We're here for a reason,
Spike.

17:57.144 --> 18:02.214
Tragedy.
Is there blood?

18:02.249 --> 18:06.286
He knows.
He must've seen
the body.

18:06.318 --> 18:09.388
You did it once.
I heard about it.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.258
Spike,
we need to know
who did this.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.163
Look at you--

18:16.195 --> 18:18.131
glowing.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.103
What's a word
means "glowing"?
It's gotta rhyme.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.272
Spike, please.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.910
Uh--I-I-I should hide.

18:30.942 --> 18:33.945
Hide from you.
Hide my face.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.615
You know what I did.

18:35.647 --> 18:39.486
Boy, he's extra useful
today.
This isn't the time.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.822
Everyone's talking to me.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.525
No one's talking to each other.

18:46.492 --> 18:49.296
We might as well go.

18:49.328 --> 18:53.365
Someone isn't here!
(Claps Hands, Chuckles)

18:53.400 --> 18:56.302
Button, button.
Who's got the button?

18:56.336 --> 18:59.506
My money's on the witch.

18:59.538 --> 19:03.843
Red's a bad girl.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.845
He's talking
about Willow.

19:05.877 --> 19:08.815
And that means something
because he's chock-full
of sanity.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.019
Maybe he saw her.

19:14.053 --> 19:18.458
They think you did it--
The Slayer and her boy.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.394
They think you took the skin.

19:21.428 --> 19:24.963
Is there something here?
Something that killed?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.933
"Her boy"?
I'm "her boy"?

19:29.501 --> 19:32.404
I have to go.

19:32.439 --> 19:36.209
There are things here
without permission.
I have to check their slips.

19:36.242 --> 19:39.111
Make sure they have
authorization.

19:43.615 --> 19:44.884
I need help.

19:44.916 --> 19:47.420
I don't have any money.
I don't want money.

19:49.721 --> 19:52.892
Come in.
Enjoy my personal space.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.895
I found a dead body
near the high school.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.266
Yes, that can happen.

19:59.298 --> 20:02.734
Something horrible killed a boy.
Took his skin right off.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.770
(Together)
Was it you? No!

20:04.804 --> 20:08.540
Well, with the skin thing,
they're definitely gonna think
it was you.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.042
Buffy is, anyway.
Yeah.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.045
Maybe she already does.
I don't know.

20:13.078 --> 20:17.048
I-I have to find
whatever did this.
I just--

20:17.083 --> 20:19.251
(Sighs)
I need to do something right.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.788
Oh, and so they'll think
it wasn't you, right?

20:21.820 --> 20:24.022
I mean, that has
to be part of it.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.794
Maybe you're even thinking, you
killed this thing. They don't
even have to know about it.

20:27.826 --> 20:29.528
Won't suspect you
even for a minute.

20:29.561 --> 20:33.299
No, I--I don't--
When did you get all insightful?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.768
I'm surprisingly sensitive.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.769
So will you help me?

20:37.804 --> 20:41.673
(Sighs)
Is it difficult
or time-consuming?

20:46.945 --> 20:49.248
This isn't gonna get
all sexy, is it?

20:49.281 --> 20:52.050
I'd be shocked.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.153
Okay, do you have
your powder?
Oh, I ate that.

20:56.455 --> 20:57.923
I have it.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.226
Okay, we scatter it
over the map,

21:00.259 --> 21:03.563
and everywhere there's
a demon, a little light
appears.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.432
Oh, pretty!

21:05.464 --> 21:09.602
Will it hurt the carpet?
No.
(Inhales)

21:11.538 --> 21:13.306
Okay. Scatter.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.279
Ooh!
Oh!

21:21.314 --> 21:24.483
Hey, look!
That's me.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.551
Hello.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.520
What's that huge clump?

21:28.555 --> 21:30.990
WILLOW:
It's the high school.

21:31.022 --> 21:35.461
It's all Hellmouthy underneath.
Things have been stirring
there lately.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.798
Is it getting brighter?

21:38.830 --> 21:40.732
Smoke!
Oh!

21:46.405 --> 21:48.840
Oh! Okay!

21:48.875 --> 21:51.877
Remember our talk
about the carpet?

21:51.911 --> 21:53.846
Hey, th-this could be it.

21:53.880 --> 21:57.384
It's strong.
I-I-It's near the body,

21:57.416 --> 21:59.685
and it's all by itself,

21:59.719 --> 22:03.690
hiding in the woods
or-or--maybe a cave.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.290
There are
a couple good caves
around there.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.559
I don't know.
Sounds pretty thin to me.

22:07.594 --> 22:12.163
Well, that's why you teleport
over there real quick
like a bun--

22:12.198 --> 22:15.000
uh, real quick,
and, uh, see if I'm right.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.403
No. Sorry.
You damaged my carpet.

22:17.436 --> 22:21.540
Anya, you're
a vengeance demon.
Just... teleport.

22:21.574 --> 22:26.679
(Sighs) Well, as it turns out,
teleporting isn't a right.
It's a privilege.

22:26.712 --> 22:30.383
I withdrew a vengeance spell
last week, and this is
my punishment.

22:30.416 --> 22:35.020
I can only teleport
for official business.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.256
I have to file a flight plan
and everything.

22:37.288 --> 22:41.394
Oh. I'm sorry, that--
that must be hard.

22:41.427 --> 22:44.063
Yeah. It bites
a pretty big one.

22:44.096 --> 22:48.701
And the vengeance itself,
i-it's--

22:48.734 --> 22:51.770
it's not as fulfilling
as I remember.

22:51.804 --> 22:56.107
Really?
'Cause I got the impression
that you enjoyed,

22:56.142 --> 22:58.510
you know,
inflicting.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.913
Well, causing pain
sounds really cool,
I know, but...

23:01.948 --> 23:06.786
it turns out
it's really upsetting.

23:06.818 --> 23:09.121
Didn't use to be.
But now it is.

23:11.156 --> 23:14.727
Is it like...
you're scared of losing
that feeling again,

23:14.760 --> 23:17.763
and that having it be okay
to hurt people,

23:17.797 --> 23:22.801
and then you're not in charge
of the power anymore
because it's in charge of you?

23:22.835 --> 23:25.136
Wow. That was...

23:25.171 --> 23:29.541
reallyoverdramatically stated,
but, yeah, that's it.

23:29.576 --> 23:32.711
I get it.
Believe me.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.815
I'm sorry, Willow.

23:35.847 --> 23:40.653
I wish it were better
for you.
You too.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.656
It did get a little sexy,
didn't it?

23:46.192 --> 23:48.728
I have to find this monster.

23:48.760 --> 23:52.798
Willow, um, isn't there
another spell?

23:52.832 --> 23:55.501
I mean, you're trying to find
Buffy and Xander.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.569
Couldn't we use a spell
to do that?

23:57.604 --> 24:02.273
I did. I-I tried
and something went kaflooey,
and it didn't work.

24:02.307 --> 24:05.478
-What did it say?
-It said they don't exist.

24:10.817 --> 24:14.686
I looked up demons that
skin their victims and demons
that flay their victims,

24:14.721 --> 24:16.122
'cause, you know,
same thing.

24:16.154 --> 24:18.089
There's a ton
of prospects.

24:18.124 --> 24:23.762
Anything else gone?
Uh, eyeballs, toenails
or viscera? That's guts.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.633
She knows about viscera.
Makes you proud.

24:26.665 --> 24:30.603
-Just skin.
-Okay. I'll work on that.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.704
(Sighs Deeply)
(Computer Beeps)

24:37.242 --> 24:39.177
(Sighs)
What's up?

24:39.211 --> 24:42.347
I need to do something.

24:42.381 --> 24:46.451
I just--I have this feeling
in my gut--
In your viscera?

24:46.484 --> 24:48.654
that we know exactly
who did this.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.323
And all of this work
we're doing is just
a way for us...

24:51.356 --> 24:53.291
to convince ourselves
that Willow's okay.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.528
Oh, guys.
I got a good one.

24:58.396 --> 25:02.701
A demon called Gnarl.
He's a parasite with
these nasty long fingernails.

25:02.734 --> 25:06.204
He secretes something
through them and uses that
to paralyze his victims.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.807
He then cuts strips
of their skin while
they're still alive.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.910
It takes hours.

25:10.942 --> 25:13.378
We didn't find
any strips of skin.

25:13.412 --> 25:15.882
Which, by the way--
(Shudders)

25:15.914 --> 25:18.084
You wouldn't.
He eats them.

25:18.116 --> 25:21.519
That's why he's a parasite.
It's like his natural food.

25:21.554 --> 25:25.423
Dawn, you're new at this,
and-and I get why you're proud.

25:25.457 --> 25:29.996
But I'm not exactly sure why
this demon is any more likely
than any of the others?

25:30.028 --> 25:32.198
You never said pool of blood.

25:32.230 --> 25:34.866
There was no pool,
just splatters.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.769
Then this is your guy.
He laps up the blood.

25:37.804 --> 25:41.507
-You could say it's like
his natural beverage.
-You're terrifying.

25:41.539 --> 25:45.010
Now if we just knew how
to find this thing.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.378
Well, we can ask some questions
over at Willy's place.

25:47.413 --> 25:49.548
Or we could be smart.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.851
-Sorry, Xander.
-What?

25:51.884 --> 25:55.554
Well, whoever did this
had to get blood on them,

25:55.587 --> 25:58.289
which means they left a trail.
Right.
Minute traces of blood.

25:58.324 --> 26:01.393
-And we have a way to track it.
-We have a--

26:01.426 --> 26:03.796
Oh. I get it.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.634
What? How--

26:07.666 --> 26:09.769
What's goin' on?

26:09.801 --> 26:13.640
William's a good boy.
Carries her water,
carries her sin.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.942
It's supposed to get easier,
isn't it? It's supposed to help
to help, but it doesn't.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.411
It's still so heavy.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.382
We should've put
a leash on him.

26:23.414 --> 26:26.152
Yes, let's tie ourselves
to the crazy vampire.

26:26.184 --> 26:29.622
You really think
it's gonna work?
It's pretty easy.

26:29.655 --> 26:34.559
Spike follows the exciting smell
of blood, and we follow
the fairly ripe smell of Spike.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.996
It's
"smellementary."

26:37.028 --> 26:39.965
Also, I'm sure
there's tons of stuff
like this.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.835
You know, procedures
we can use that don't
involve magic spells.

26:42.868 --> 26:45.070
Just good solid
detective work.

26:45.104 --> 26:49.508
And we can develop a database
of tooth impressions
and demon skin samples,

26:49.540 --> 26:51.576
and I could wear
high heels more often.

26:51.609 --> 26:54.145
Wow.
That was so close
to being empowered.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.414
Everybody loves
a slender ankle.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.852
That's it.
End of the line.
Everyone off.

26:59.885 --> 27:02.788
Keep your ticket.
You'll need that.

27:02.821 --> 27:05.191
That's a rock cliff.

27:05.223 --> 27:09.127
Well, give him a break,
Buffy. Maybe it's a vicious,
skin-eating rock cliff.

27:09.161 --> 27:12.530
There's a cave in it.
Look.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.903
I'm insane.
What's his excuse?

27:30.182 --> 27:33.051
(Grunting)

27:49.234 --> 27:52.238
(Footsteps)

27:52.270 --> 27:55.007
GNARL:
All alone.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.109
(Grunts)

28:03.548 --> 28:06.752
Dark and dank.
I was hopin' it'd be
dark and dank.

28:06.786 --> 28:10.021
Shh!
Do you hear that?
(Creaking)

28:10.056 --> 28:12.157
No, I don't.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.326
But now I do.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.328
Something's moving
in here.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.865
Guess we're in
the right place.

28:20.932 --> 28:23.402
GNARL:
Look at the shorn lamb.

28:23.434 --> 28:26.739
See how it trembles?

28:26.772 --> 28:31.576
Is it the cold wind?
(Exhales)

28:31.609 --> 28:36.816
Or is it that the flock
is nowhere to be seen?

28:38.150 --> 28:43.255
Poor little lamb,
all alone.

28:45.457 --> 28:48.626
-You guys hear that,
right?
-Yep.

28:48.660 --> 28:52.463
It's echoing. I-I know
it sounds close, but I'm--
(Screeches)

28:52.498 --> 28:54.933
(Screams)
Dawn!
Are you okay?

28:54.967 --> 28:58.069
(Panting)
I guess so.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.571
Poison paralyzes.
BUFFY:
Dawn.

29:00.605 --> 29:03.442
Okay, we need to get her
out of here.
We'll deal with him later.

29:03.474 --> 29:05.411
Seal him in.
(Gasping)

29:07.645 --> 29:10.582
(Pounding, Crumbling)
What's going on?
Who's there?

29:12.651 --> 29:15.621
No! Stop!

29:15.653 --> 29:17.522
(Gnarl Laughing)

29:22.428 --> 29:25.596
(Laughing Continues)

29:30.336 --> 29:35.307
(Gnarl)
No way out now.
No way out.

29:35.340 --> 29:39.278
Protect me, Goddess.
In thy name
I supplicate myself.

29:39.310 --> 29:44.150
Take the powers from my enemy
and lay him lower
than the lowest field.

29:44.182 --> 29:48.019
Gnarl loves spells!

29:48.054 --> 29:50.355
He keeps them as pets.

29:50.388 --> 29:53.259
They love him.

29:53.291 --> 29:57.829
And they leave him alone.
(Laughs)

29:57.864 --> 30:02.701
You may be immune to magic,
but I got more than that.
You wanna fight?

30:02.733 --> 30:05.971
Your friends left you here.

30:06.005 --> 30:09.976
(Singsongy)
No one comes to save you.

30:10.009 --> 30:15.580
They wanted me
to have you.
(Panting)

30:16.682 --> 30:18.616
(Groans)

30:18.650 --> 30:22.054
The computer. That thing
Dawn was reading might have
an antidote for the paralysis.

30:22.087 --> 30:24.522
Mmm. Buffy?

30:24.556 --> 30:27.125
What?
(Muffled)
I'm really sorry.

30:27.159 --> 30:30.863
Oh, it's okay.
You couldn't help it.
It had paralyzing fingernails.

30:30.896 --> 30:33.199
Just like you said it would.
So good on you.
Mmm!

30:33.231 --> 30:37.669
GNARL:
Did they leave you
as a giftie for me?

30:37.702 --> 30:42.473
Are you a tasty
little giftie?
Stop it!

30:42.508 --> 30:45.344
Or did they just
throw you away?

30:45.376 --> 30:48.346
Were they here?
Were my friends really here?

30:48.380 --> 30:50.715
I heard something.
(Screeches)

30:50.749 --> 30:53.618
(Gasping, Grunting)

30:55.887 --> 31:00.592
They were here.
Here they were.
And there they went.

31:00.625 --> 31:04.096
(Singsongy)
Gone, all gone,
what a pretty song.

31:04.130 --> 31:08.299
They sealed you in with me.

31:09.902 --> 31:14.873
I love a giftie.

31:17.209 --> 31:21.680
Can't wait to unwrap it.
(Chuckles)

31:21.712 --> 31:25.217
Mmm.
(Laughs)

31:25.250 --> 31:27.653
(Inhales)

31:31.457 --> 31:33.791
(Slurps)
(Gasps)

31:33.825 --> 31:36.894
Okay, watch--
watch the head.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.896
(Muffled) Watch my head!
Watch my head!
I've got you.

31:38.931 --> 31:41.700
Sofa.

31:41.732 --> 31:44.269
(Straining)
(Groaning)

31:44.302 --> 31:47.105
(Muffled) Face up! Face up!
Oh! She's right.
Face up is better.

31:47.138 --> 31:50.909
Okay, I'm gonna check
the computer, find that page,
see if there's an antidote.

31:50.942 --> 31:54.779
It'll be all right.
We'll get you fixed up.

31:54.813 --> 31:58.317
-You'll be doin' limbo
in no time.
-(Muffled) Yeah, as a pole.

31:58.349 --> 32:01.487
No. Not as a pole.
I promise.

32:01.519 --> 32:03.990
Oh, got it!

32:04.022 --> 32:06.924
It says the paralysis
is permanent.

32:06.959 --> 32:11.096
-(Gasps)
-No. Oh, wait.
My bad.

32:11.130 --> 32:15.433
-Um, "permanent until
the creature dies." Sorry.
-(Moans)

32:15.467 --> 32:17.935
(Sighs)
I guess we have to go back.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.105
We can't just leave her
here like this.
What if she vomits?

32:20.138 --> 32:22.641
(Groaning, Mumbling) Vomit?!

32:22.673 --> 32:25.978
-Do you think she'll vomit?
-(Muffled)
Stop talking about vomit!

32:26.011 --> 32:28.013
I'll call Anya.
She can watch her.
Right.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.481
She'll love
being called
for vomit watch.

32:30.516 --> 32:33.785
(Muffled)
Stop talking about vomit!

32:33.818 --> 32:38.223
Gnarl makes
a pretty picture.

32:39.357 --> 32:42.661
It's easy when you know how.

32:42.693 --> 32:47.365
It's easy when
everyone helps.

32:47.398 --> 32:49.667
Mm-hmm.

32:49.701 --> 32:52.570
They helped me.

32:54.873 --> 33:00.046
Too bad there's no one
to help you.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.229
Mmm.
(Grunts)

33:17.262 --> 33:20.132
-Mmm.
-ANYA:
I bet she's dying.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.901
She's not dying.
She's just paralyzed.

33:22.933 --> 33:25.070
Oh.
Paralyzed how?

33:25.104 --> 33:28.539
Paralyzed how?
In the "not moving" way.

33:28.574 --> 33:32.377
Well, there's lots
of different ways.
Did you try this?

33:34.445 --> 33:35.713
-Hey!
-(Muffled)
Hey!

33:35.747 --> 33:38.750
XANDER:
Oh. You're poseable.

33:38.784 --> 33:42.753
She's poseable?
ANYA: It's a common variety.
Watch this.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.291
(Grunts)
(Exhales)

33:48.794 --> 33:53.332
Huh.
Neat as you please.
Hardly a need to undo her.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.866
-(Mumbles)
-Mmm.
Where'd you get the nuts?

33:55.901 --> 33:57.836
-Brazil.
-(Mumbles)

33:57.868 --> 34:00.605
No need to thank me,
by the way,
for sitting with her.

34:00.638 --> 34:03.342
I'm feeling very
benevolent today.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.611
Helping Willow.
Helping you.

34:05.644 --> 34:08.679
Might even call it even
for that whole worm thing
last week.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.581
Yeah, I don't think
we could call--

34:10.614 --> 34:12.784
Wait.
You saw Willow?

34:12.818 --> 34:15.286
Mm-hmm.
Oh, she's looking for you,
by the way.

34:15.320 --> 34:18.190
Decided you might be out
in some cave.
Sounded pretty tenuous.

34:18.224 --> 34:21.360
-Cave?
-Anya, listen.
This is really important.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.460
Did Willow go
to that cave?

34:23.494 --> 34:26.097
Mm-hmm. Last time I saw her
that's where she was headed.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.733
Shall I make her salute?
That'd be very cute.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.702
Xander, she could be there
right now. Willow could
be trapped with the Gnarl.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.306
Oh, it's not "the Gnarl"--
just Gnarl.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.974
Oh. Wouldn't it be tragic
if you were here being
kinda silly...

34:37.007 --> 34:39.945
with your comically
paralyzed sister
while Willow was dying?

34:42.514 --> 34:45.784
Anya, you know about
this creature?
Uh-huh. Sure.

34:45.817 --> 34:48.253
-You're coming with us.
-(Sighs)

34:48.286 --> 34:52.523
(Muffled Grunting)

34:56.628 --> 34:58.164
(Muffled Whimper)

34:58.197 --> 35:03.068
(Muffled)
They wouldn't leave.
They'll return.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.237
(Laughing)

35:05.271 --> 35:07.739
They don't want you.

35:07.773 --> 35:12.543
(Singsongy)
Lock you in,
nice white skin.

35:14.146 --> 35:17.648
And if they do return,
where will they find you?

35:17.682 --> 35:22.153
Inside me you'll already be.

35:22.188 --> 35:25.990
Ohh.

35:26.023 --> 35:29.394
Ah, love it.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.731
(Willow Whimpering)

35:42.541 --> 35:44.710
Anya, you gotta
keep up!

35:44.742 --> 35:47.612
I'm out of shape.
I've been teleporting
for months.

35:47.646 --> 35:48.914
Hurry!

35:49.914 --> 35:53.219
(Muffled)
No. No. No.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.889
(Grunts)
(Screeches)

35:57.922 --> 36:00.291
What's going on?
Where's Willow?

36:00.326 --> 36:03.762
She's right here. Can't
you see her? She's hurt.
What? Where?

36:04.996 --> 36:07.164
There's nothing here.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.635
Your hand, it's going
right through her.
What's going on?

36:09.668 --> 36:13.972
-I don't know. But I'm startin'
to get why we haven't seen her.
-Because we haven't seen her.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.074
I have this feeling
that whatever's causing
this invisible thing...

36:17.108 --> 36:19.545
is a whole separate issue
from the skin-eating monster.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.246
-Behind you!
-(Screeches)

36:21.280 --> 36:23.949
Close one.
(Grunting)

36:30.521 --> 36:32.858
Remember what I said--
Get him in the eyes!

36:32.891 --> 36:34.992
-(Grunts)
-(Blade Swooshes)

36:35.025 --> 36:38.396
Willow.
I'm here.

36:38.429 --> 36:41.199
Wow.
You're really hurt.

36:41.233 --> 36:44.436
-What's goin' on?
-Buffy's fighting the demon
over there, see?

36:44.469 --> 36:46.170
But if they get too close,
I'm going to have to run.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.873
(Blade Swooshes)
I don't see.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.677
But they're here--
Buffy and Xander.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.780
Someone came?
They didn't leave me?

36:54.813 --> 36:58.784
No, they didn't leave you.
They can't see you.
Oh.

36:58.817 --> 37:03.621
They're here. They're here.
I'm not alone.

37:03.655 --> 37:08.626
Good.
You're doing really good.

37:08.659 --> 37:10.829
-(Laughing)
-(Grunting)

37:15.400 --> 37:18.869
(Screeches)

37:18.903 --> 37:23.409
(Screeches)

37:25.175 --> 37:28.813
Ew! Ew.
Thumbs?

37:28.847 --> 37:33.952
-I can't believe you did that.
-Oh! Buffy killed the demon.
It was gross.

37:33.985 --> 37:37.054
(Panting)
I can--I can move.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.458
-Ohh!
-(Squeals, Hits Ground)

37:39.490 --> 37:42.260
Willow,
are you here?

37:42.293 --> 37:44.596
Where is she?
Is she alive?

37:44.630 --> 37:46.731
She's right here.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.900
Stand back.
You're getting
your feet in her.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.268
Willow?

37:51.302 --> 37:55.039
She's hurt really bad,
you guys. I'm gonna go
get help.

37:57.108 --> 38:01.447
I think she's sort of...
here-ish.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.349
Willow?

38:03.382 --> 38:08.586
We-We can't exactly see you,
but we're really glad
that you're back.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.523
I--I-I-I don't know how badly
you're hurt, but--

38:13.958 --> 38:17.128
What's happening?

38:17.161 --> 38:19.264
I couldn't find you guys,
and I looked everywhere.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.800
And the demon said that
you left me and--

38:21.833 --> 38:26.505
Oh. There you are.
There you are.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.507
Don't go away.

38:28.539 --> 38:30.141
We're not goin' away.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.112
Oh, God.

38:34.144 --> 38:37.483
It's gonna be okay, Wil.
You're gonna be okay.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.518
I know.

38:39.550 --> 38:42.086
You're here.

38:51.929 --> 38:54.800
Buffy?

38:54.833 --> 38:57.969
Oh, I'm sorry. I--
I didn't mean to interrupt.

38:58.003 --> 39:01.972
That's all I had left
in me anyway.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.409
I didn't realize meditating
was such hard work.

39:04.443 --> 39:08.045
I'm healing.
Growing new skin.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.882
Wow.
That's magic,
right?

39:10.916 --> 39:14.219
I mean, when most people
meditate, they don't get
extra skin, right?

39:14.251 --> 39:17.222
'Cause Clem should,
like, cut back.

39:17.255 --> 39:22.393
It's magic.
I'm drawing power from
the earth to heal myself.

39:22.427 --> 39:24.695
We're on the second floor.

39:24.730 --> 39:29.199
(Laughs) You know,
Giles says everything's
part of the earth--

39:29.233 --> 39:32.938
this bed, the air, us.

39:32.971 --> 39:36.842
Explains why my fingernails
get dirty even when
I don't do anything.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.579
Plus, you stuck your thumbs
in a demon.
True.

39:45.483 --> 39:48.786
You're wiped out.
I-I should go.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.922
No.
Please stay.

39:50.956 --> 39:54.358
I missed you so much
when I couldn't find you.

39:54.391 --> 39:56.795
We missed you too.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.563
I missed you.

40:00.498 --> 40:03.635
Dawn's working on what
caused the mutual no-see-ums,
but we haven't--

40:03.668 --> 40:06.605
I did it.

40:06.637 --> 40:08.974
-You did a spell?
-I didn't mean to.

40:09.007 --> 40:14.913
I--I just remember...
thinking how I wasn't ready
to see you guys yet.

40:14.945 --> 40:19.918
I was afraid we wouldn't,
you know, connect.

40:19.951 --> 40:23.989
So you made it happen
just by thinking it?

40:24.021 --> 40:28.994
I guess I have a ways to go
before I master my powers, huh?

40:29.027 --> 40:32.329
It's okay.
As long as you're all right.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.101
It's nice to be forgiven.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.471
Too bad I need
so much of it.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.710
I have a confession to make.

40:47.144 --> 40:51.315
I thought it might be you,
with the flaying.

40:51.349 --> 40:53.652
I know.

40:53.684 --> 40:58.623
I wanna be the kind of person
that wouldn't think that.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.925
Xander never thought it.

41:00.958 --> 41:04.996
He did a little.
Heck, I did a little.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.998
Xander has the luxury
of not saying it.

41:08.032 --> 41:13.539
But you're the Slayer.
You have to say stuff like that.
It's okay.

41:13.572 --> 41:19.143
It's okay too if...
you still don't think I can
recover from this magic stuff.

41:19.177 --> 41:23.882
Because honestly, I'm not
that sure about it either.

41:29.186 --> 41:31.989
(Sighs)

41:34.259 --> 41:36.161
I thought you were
too tired.

41:36.193 --> 41:39.864
It hurts too much
not to try.

41:39.898 --> 41:42.701
I'm sorry.

41:42.733 --> 41:45.971
And it just takes
so much strength--

41:46.003 --> 41:48.039
I don't have that much.

41:52.277 --> 41:55.681
Well, I got so much strength,
I'm givin' it away.

41:55.713 --> 41:58.048
Are you sure?

41:59.349 --> 42:01.485
Will it help?

42:01.518 --> 42:03.420
Much.

42:04.956 --> 42:08.025
Good.
(Sighs)

42:21.371 --> 42:23.440
(theme music plays)

42:41.159 --> 42:42.994
Grr! Arrgh!
