00:00.260 --> 00:01.780
- [Gordon] Tonight on Hotel Hell,

00:01.780 --> 00:02.649
(siren blaring)

00:02.649 --> 00:06.204
a near-fatal accident has
left Mississippi hotel owners

00:06.204 --> 00:07.820
in a desperate situation.

00:07.820 --> 00:10.072
- Legs.
- I broke both of my ankles

00:10.072 --> 00:12.741
and back in two places.

00:12.741 --> 00:14.358
- The business is failing.

00:14.358 --> 00:16.036
And with not enough money coming in,

00:16.036 --> 00:18.309
this married couple have lost their home.

00:18.309 --> 00:19.853
You live in here?
- Yes.

00:19.853 --> 00:20.787
- [Gordon] There's not even a window!

00:20.787 --> 00:22.209
- You have to do what you have to do!

00:22.209 --> 00:23.575
- [Gordon] If I don't do something soon,

00:23.575 --> 00:24.955
they will lose everything.

00:24.955 --> 00:26.088
(upbeat dramatic music)

00:26.088 --> 00:27.517
- We have two children.

00:27.517 --> 00:29.279
I would like for them not to have to worry

00:29.279 --> 00:31.083
about their mom and dad.

00:31.083 --> 00:34.628
- You've let this business
swallow the both of you up.

00:34.628 --> 00:36.672
I think you deserve something better.

00:36.672 --> 00:38.505
I only hope I'm not too late.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.168
(upbeat music)

00:40.168 --> 00:42.479
(bell dings)

00:42.479 --> 00:44.521
(upbeat rock music)

00:44.521 --> 00:47.302
(spider chirps)

01:03.025 --> 01:04.534
(electricity buzzes)

01:04.534 --> 01:07.452
The Hotel Chester is located
in Starkville, Mississippi,

01:07.452 --> 01:09.642
home to the Mississippi State University.

01:09.642 --> 01:11.999
Husband and wife, David
and Sukie Mollendor,

01:11.999 --> 01:13.823
bought the hotel in 2000.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.149
Before buying the Chester,
David travelled the world

01:16.149 --> 01:17.994
as a hotel trouble-shooter.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.489
- Well, I worked in the
hotel industry 39 years.

01:20.489 --> 01:21.393
(telephone rings)

01:21.393 --> 01:23.260
Thank you for calling Hotel Chester.

01:23.260 --> 01:26.002
Wanted to try and settle
down and give our kids

01:26.002 --> 01:27.726
one stable place to be.

01:29.391 --> 01:32.144
One of us gotta get taller. (laughs)

01:32.144 --> 01:34.240
- [Gordon] To begin
with, a 36-bedroom hotel

01:34.240 --> 01:37.604
was a real success, packed
with students and locals.

01:37.604 --> 01:38.473
- [David] How are you doing?

01:38.473 --> 01:41.278
- [Man] Good, how you doing?
(David laughing)

01:41.278 --> 01:44.399
- [Gordon] Then a sudden
tragedy hit the family.

01:44.399 --> 01:45.791
(siren blaring)

01:45.791 --> 01:46.659
(camera shutters flicker)

01:46.659 --> 01:49.192
(man speaking over radio phone)

01:49.192 --> 01:53.738
- David was coming home and was involved

01:53.738 --> 01:58.472
in a major auto accident.
We thought we'd lost him.

01:58.472 --> 02:01.038
That changed all of us overnight.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.079
(soft music)

02:02.079 --> 02:05.333
- He crushed his feet and was bedridden

02:05.333 --> 02:07.622
for almost six months.

02:07.622 --> 02:10.192
(gentle upbeat music)

02:10.192 --> 02:11.120
- It's a little dated!

02:11.120 --> 02:12.789
- The decor is very dated.

02:12.789 --> 02:15.145
- [Gordon] In David's
absence, standards dropped

02:15.145 --> 02:16.334
and customers stopped coming.

02:16.334 --> 02:18.023
- Well, we were losing so much money

02:18.023 --> 02:20.588
that I had to file for bankruptcy.

02:20.588 --> 02:22.538
- The financial losses have been so bad,

02:22.538 --> 02:24.196
the bank foreclosed on their home,

02:24.196 --> 02:26.083
so now they're living in the hotel.

02:26.083 --> 02:30.066
- Living in the hotel,
working together in the hotel,

02:30.066 --> 02:35.280
I feel tired and I feel
out of sync with the world.

02:36.432 --> 02:37.301
(upbeat dramatic music)

02:37.301 --> 02:38.762
- [Gordon] They couldn't afford payroll,

02:38.762 --> 02:40.796
so Sukie left her job in real estate

02:40.796 --> 02:43.402
and took over as chef
and temporary manager.

02:43.402 --> 02:47.698
- It was my idea that we
open a sushI restaurant.

02:47.698 --> 02:50.441
Never worked in any
restaurant kitchens before

02:50.441 --> 02:55.154
in my entire life, but I
knew how to make the sushi.

02:55.154 --> 02:56.509
- My mouth's confused.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.094
- [Gordon] But despite
her best intentions,

02:58.094 --> 02:59.783
with no formal training-

02:59.783 --> 03:00.652
- Oh!

03:00.652 --> 03:01.521
- [Gordon] She's struggling.

03:01.521 --> 03:06.186
- Oh, uh-uh. Oh, where's my knife!

03:06.186 --> 03:08.115
- [Gordon] Sukie spends
all her time in the hotel,

03:08.115 --> 03:10.888
so she's blind to the tens
of thousands of students

03:10.888 --> 03:13.388
and tourists, who could
be potential customers.

03:13.388 --> 03:15.570
And the hotel's bedrooms and dining room

03:15.570 --> 03:16.875
are empty most nights.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.028
- I just need those entrees.

03:18.028 --> 03:20.106
- [Sukie] Yeah.
- But I guess they're coming.

03:20.106 --> 03:21.618
- You know, I see it if my parent cries,

03:21.618 --> 03:24.412
I see that they're physically exhausted,

03:24.412 --> 03:26.487
that they're mentally drained.

03:26.487 --> 03:29.271
- My mom, she used to be lively, vibrant.

03:29.271 --> 03:32.253
She's honestly half the
woman she used to be.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.328
- Man, I'm losing my mind.

03:34.328 --> 03:38.124
- When I came to this
place I was 180 pounds

03:38.124 --> 03:42.472
of twisted blue steel, sex
appeal and mucho health.

03:42.472 --> 03:47.248
Then this old bitch has worn
me down to 200 pounds of flab,

03:47.248 --> 03:49.173
gab, and (speaks foreign language).

03:54.126 --> 03:55.860
(gentle music)

03:55.860 --> 03:58.175
- [Gordon] With almost no
money coming in to the hotel,

03:58.175 --> 04:01.296
David and Sukie are hanging
on by a very thin thread.

04:02.356 --> 04:05.318
- I need Gordon to help my parents

04:05.318 --> 04:08.394
because if this hotel doesn't change,

04:08.394 --> 04:11.880
it's we lose everything This is it.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.464
(bright upbeat music)

04:16.464 --> 04:17.593
(birds chirping)

04:17.593 --> 04:18.461
(car engine revving)

04:18.461 --> 04:21.365
- I'm in Starkville,
Mississippi's college town.

04:21.365 --> 04:23.190
I'm on my way to the Hotel Chester.

04:24.264 --> 04:28.049
Mississippi State
University, founded in 1878.

04:28.049 --> 04:30.093
Any hotel with a college on their doorstep

04:30.093 --> 04:31.876
should be absolutely thriving,
not just with the students

04:31.876 --> 04:33.909
but with their parents as well.

04:33.909 --> 04:36.307
I can't wait to check-in
to the Hotel Chester.

04:37.537 --> 04:38.706
Where is this place?

04:38.706 --> 04:40.364
(car engine revving)

04:40.364 --> 04:43.252
(gentle upbeat music)

04:43.252 --> 04:44.607
I can't even see the sign.

04:45.637 --> 04:48.895
(soft music) Okay, I'll pull in over here.

04:48.895 --> 04:51.187
They've got to know where it is.

04:51.187 --> 04:52.055
How are you?

04:52.055 --> 04:53.335
- [Male Student] Hey, I'm good.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.846
- I'm looking for the Hotel Chester.

04:54.846 --> 04:55.902
- I've never been there
before. I've passed it.

04:55.902 --> 04:56.770
- You ever been there?

04:56.770 --> 04:57.639
- [Female Student] It's
one block down on the left.

04:57.639 --> 04:59.111
- No, I can't find it, I've
gone 'round three times.

04:59.111 --> 05:00.196
- It's easy to miss.

05:00.196 --> 05:01.124
- [Gordon] Easy to miss?

05:01.124 --> 05:02.588
- Yeah.
- I can't see any signs.

05:02.588 --> 05:03.689
- Well, there may be one sign

05:03.689 --> 05:06.129
but, I mean, it's not too big, no.

05:06.129 --> 05:07.075
- Okay, great.

05:07.075 --> 05:08.287
(girls laughing)

05:08.287 --> 05:11.385
Excellent, thank you, enjoy.

05:11.385 --> 05:13.573
(upbeat dramatic music)

05:13.573 --> 05:15.273
The students never go to the Chester,

05:15.273 --> 05:18.592
despite the fact that it's
right next to the campus, weird!

05:19.809 --> 05:23.910
There we are, there, Historic
Hotel Chester entrance, wow.

05:24.783 --> 05:29.214
Such a huge building and such
a tiny sign, it's madness!

05:29.214 --> 05:30.083
Finally

05:32.196 --> 05:33.448
morning sir! How are you?

05:33.448 --> 05:36.001
- Hey, good morning! How are you?

05:36.001 --> 05:36.870
- Good to see you. Gordon.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.578
- Good to see you and I'm David, Gordon.

05:38.578 --> 05:39.683
- David, nice to see you.

05:39.683 --> 05:42.105
well, I've finally found the place!

05:42.105 --> 05:44.073
That is so confusing there, you know that?

05:44.073 --> 05:46.702
There's no sign on the main
street, I drove straight by!

05:46.702 --> 05:47.571
It was difficult.

05:47.571 --> 05:49.286
- You didn't see 'em on
the corner of the building?

05:49.286 --> 05:51.427
- [Gordon] A tiny sign
saying it's historic?

05:51.427 --> 05:53.043
- That's what's historic about it.

05:53.043 --> 05:53.912
- Oh, that's, that-

05:53.912 --> 05:56.745
- It's historically been a bad entrance.

05:58.389 --> 06:01.350
Now, we have you in an
executive king room.

06:01.350 --> 06:03.999
And then here's two keys for
you 'cause I'm giving you two

06:03.999 --> 06:07.169
because men don't follow
instructions as well as women.

06:07.169 --> 06:10.894
Or in case you get
lucky, hell yes! (laughs)

06:11.924 --> 06:13.008
- So you're a hands-on owner.

06:13.008 --> 06:15.041
Are you running the desk all by yourself?

06:15.041 --> 06:18.712
- My wife is the chef.
She's taught herself.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.244
- Can I meet this lady?

06:20.244 --> 06:22.830
- Well, can I finish my spiel?

06:22.830 --> 06:23.915
- Oh, I thought you'd all ready finished.

06:23.915 --> 06:27.867
- So breakfast is included,
we do have fresh cut fruit.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.264
- That's nice to know, fresh cut fruit.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.488
what would be the alternative, canned?

06:32.475 --> 06:35.384
- No, no fruit, I think
would be the alternative.

06:35.384 --> 06:37.915
- Oh, (laughs) I love
your sense of humour.

06:37.915 --> 06:40.483
(David laughs)
It's dry and very funny.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.225
Fresh cut fruit for breakfast.

06:42.225 --> 06:43.434
- Yes sir.
- Nice.

06:43.434 --> 06:46.394
- Now, I just want you to know
I'm not always at the desk

06:46.394 --> 06:49.075
but you'll be able to recognise me

06:49.075 --> 06:51.161
even if I'm walking away from you

06:51.161 --> 06:53.788
'cause I'm the one who looks
like he's riding a chicken.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.144
- Riding a chicken?
- [David] Yeah.

06:55.144 --> 06:57.094
- I've never ridden a chicken.
you'll have to show me. oh.

06:57.094 --> 06:58.856
- Well, you just have to look at my legs.

06:58.856 --> 06:59.724
- Oh, jeez.

06:59.724 --> 07:03.121
- (laughing) I'll go and get Sukie, okay?

07:03.121 --> 07:07.760
- Okay, great, that poor
chicken. Fucking hell!

07:07.760 --> 07:10.532
(gentle upbeat)

07:10.532 --> 07:11.401
- Ugh! ah!

07:12.810 --> 07:15.667
It's so hot, actually! Ooh!

07:17.041 --> 07:19.230
- I've got a guest that wants to meet you.

07:20.936 --> 07:21.805
- Oh, okay.

07:21.805 --> 07:23.485
- Uh-oh, what do you do with that?

07:23.485 --> 07:25.487
- I am making tamago.

07:25.487 --> 07:29.386
Gordon is here to help
us out and I'm terrified

07:29.386 --> 07:31.889
but at the same time I am so excited.

07:31.889 --> 07:33.443
- Okay, oh!
- [Sukie] Hi!

07:33.443 --> 07:35.455
- Hello, how are you?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.425
Nice to see you.

07:36.425 --> 07:37.843
Don't worry, I've had
worse than wet hands,

07:37.843 --> 07:38.711
nice to meet you.

07:38.711 --> 07:39.580
- I washed my hands.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.446
- That was very kind, thank
you for that. (lips smacking)

07:41.446 --> 07:42.816
- Thank you.
- Sukie, right?

07:42.816 --> 07:43.685
- Nice to meet you.

07:43.685 --> 07:45.422
- Likewise, good to see
you too. (David laughs)

07:45.422 --> 07:46.935
What's it like working with your wife?

07:46.935 --> 07:49.938
- I love my wife so it's
nice to be around her

07:49.938 --> 07:53.139
until she gets her nose out of joint.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.849
She has a chef's temperament.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.799
If you're not familiar with it,

07:56.799 --> 07:59.197
well, they can fly off
the handle pretty easy.

08:00.543 --> 08:01.523
- What's your background?

08:01.523 --> 08:02.680
- I'm a hotel guy.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.124
I was in Vietnam and I
went to hotel school.

08:05.124 --> 08:06.700
- So you've owned other hotels?

08:06.700 --> 08:08.478
So you've qualified as a hotelier?

08:08.478 --> 08:11.001
- Well, so in my view, yeah. (laughs)

08:11.001 --> 08:13.639
- Well, that's very good!
That's good to hear!

08:13.639 --> 08:18.581
- Graduated with a major in
hotel and restaurant management

08:18.581 --> 08:21.126
and have been in the
business almost 40 years.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.347
- [Gordon] So, in a nutshell,
what's wrong with the hotel?

08:23.347 --> 08:25.182
- That's the question, we're not sure.

08:25.182 --> 08:27.135
we don't think it's a quality issue,

08:28.164 --> 08:32.085
neither for our rooms or
our food and beverage.

08:32.085 --> 08:33.440
- Why don't you both show me to the room?

08:33.440 --> 08:34.482
- [Sukie] Okay.

08:34.482 --> 08:37.423
- I've been a general
manager of a lot of hotels.

08:37.423 --> 08:40.113
I eventually became a turnaround guy

08:40.113 --> 08:42.313
to take on problem properties.

08:42.313 --> 08:46.213
So my big surprise here is that
I'm having a hell of a time

08:46.213 --> 08:48.445
trying to turn this thing around.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.695
We just call it an executive king.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.563
- Oh, wow.

08:51.510 --> 08:54.816
Oh, dear, okay, this is it? Yes sir.

08:54.816 --> 08:55.872
What is that, suede?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.602
- It's leather, but it's a rough leather

08:59.602 --> 09:01.336
and very difficult to clean.

09:02.605 --> 09:05.472
- And it's so bland! I mean,
it's like a cheap motel chain.

09:05.472 --> 09:08.141
I feel like I'm in the
witness protection programme!

09:08.141 --> 09:09.163
It's depressing here!

09:09.163 --> 09:11.150
So when was the last time
the rooms were touched?

09:11.150 --> 09:12.257
- 2003.

09:12.257 --> 09:14.319
- 2003, so ten years ago.
- Yeah.

09:14.319 --> 09:16.407
- It feels like something
out of the 1970s.

09:16.407 --> 09:18.670
- Our hotel rooms are dated.

09:18.670 --> 09:21.883
You know, we try to call
it period furniture.

09:21.883 --> 09:23.177
- Yeah, I don't know what to say,

09:23.177 --> 09:26.013
always tells you that
a place on the decline

09:26.013 --> 09:28.860
when you walk in and you've
got walls that are a mess,

09:28.860 --> 09:31.488
scuffs everywhere and
big marks on the sofas

09:31.488 --> 09:33.886
that you're expected to pay
good money to sit down in.

09:33.886 --> 09:36.319
So far, I'm not digging it.

09:37.603 --> 09:39.610
I'm gonna unpack and then
I'd like to come down

09:39.610 --> 09:41.258
and have a bite to eat.

09:41.258 --> 09:43.114
Sukie, so what's your
experience in the kitchen?

09:43.114 --> 09:46.229
- My father had a sushI
restaurant in Washington, D.C.

09:46.229 --> 09:47.098
- Parents have a Japanese restaurant?

09:47.098 --> 09:48.429
- Yeah, had, my father passed away.

09:48.429 --> 09:49.646
- And did you grow up in the kitchen?

09:49.646 --> 09:50.621
- Of course!

09:50.621 --> 09:52.102
- But did you work in the kitchen?

09:52.102 --> 09:53.208
- No, just washing dishes.

09:53.208 --> 09:54.077
(upbeat dramatic music)

09:54.077 --> 09:58.158
(David and Sukie laughing)

09:58.158 --> 10:00.673
- Anyway, listen, I'm gonna
unpack. Thank you, yeah?

10:00.673 --> 10:01.542
- Okay, hey, thank you.
Yes sir, nice meeting you.

10:01.542 --> 10:02.410
- Good to see you.

10:02.410 --> 10:04.140
Likewise, and I'll pop
down and have a bit to eat.

10:04.140 --> 10:06.228
- Okay. All right.
- Okay? Thank you.

10:08.099 --> 10:12.007
- So I feel like the guy
who walked into a bar

10:12.007 --> 10:15.261
with a big frog on his
head, went up to the bar

10:15.261 --> 10:17.291
and asked the bartender for a drink,

10:17.291 --> 10:18.907
and the bartender said, "Man, I tell you,

10:18.907 --> 10:20.641
you've got a problem don't you?"

10:20.641 --> 10:22.850
And the frog said, "yeah, I sure do-"

10:22.850 --> 10:23.787
- [Sukie] I'll see you late Dave.

10:23.787 --> 10:27.968
"Can you cut this wart
off my ass?" (laughs)

10:29.129 --> 10:30.508
- And, God, can that man talk.

10:30.508 --> 10:31.666
(upbeat dramatic music)

10:31.666 --> 10:33.977
Bars and restaurants in a
vibrant college town like this

10:33.977 --> 10:37.168
are always packed at lunchtime,
but this place is dead!

10:37.168 --> 10:38.284
- [Lindsey] I'm Lindsey.
- [Gordon] How are you?

10:38.284 --> 10:39.962
- Good! There you go!
- Thank you.

10:39.962 --> 10:41.391
- Can I get you something to drink?

10:41.391 --> 10:43.052
- Do you have some ice-cold water, please?

10:43.052 --> 10:44.820
- Okay, mm-hmm.

10:44.820 --> 10:47.063
- Thank you, my darling,
what would you recommend?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.743
- Strawberry field sushI is very popular,

10:49.743 --> 10:51.026
it's a little bit sweeter.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.277
- I'll try it.
- [Lindsey] Okay.

10:52.277 --> 10:55.288
- Las Vegas as an appetiser
as well. And then...

10:55.288 --> 10:58.561
Oh, the sakura, five individual
rolls rolled into one.

10:58.561 --> 11:00.233
(cash register creaking)

11:00.233 --> 11:02.795
(gentle music)

11:02.795 --> 11:07.323
I don't know how you execute
all that Japanese food

11:07.323 --> 11:09.753
on that menu when you're not trained,

11:09.753 --> 11:10.827
it doesn't quite make sense.

11:10.827 --> 11:12.641
(upbeat dramatic music)

11:12.641 --> 11:15.665
- [Sukie] Oh my goodness,
this is not good.

11:15.665 --> 11:17.531
- There's not a lot of
people in Starkville

11:17.531 --> 11:19.502
that like our sushi, it's
a little bit different

11:19.502 --> 11:22.018
from what other places in Starkville have.

11:23.430 --> 11:26.067
(upbeat dramatic music)

11:26.067 --> 11:26.935
- Oh.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.009
- God, they're slow.

11:35.174 --> 11:37.270
- Sukie runs her kitchen
the way she wants to.

11:37.270 --> 11:40.711
It always takes too
long in-between tickets,

11:40.711 --> 11:43.568
but there is really
nothing I can do about it.

11:43.568 --> 11:45.194
- This food is taking way too long,

11:45.194 --> 11:47.190
I've been waiting over
an hour for raw fish!

11:47.190 --> 11:49.740
(dramatic music)

11:49.740 --> 11:51.722
Oh, my God, I can't take this anymore.

11:53.669 --> 11:54.538
Ah, God!

11:54.538 --> 11:58.013
(upbeat dramatic music)

11:59.698 --> 12:01.349
- [Lindsey] Dammit.

12:01.349 --> 12:02.457
(door shuts)

12:02.457 --> 12:03.589
(electricity buzzes)

12:03.589 --> 12:04.457
(gentle upbeat music)

12:04.457 --> 12:07.112
- I'm at Starkville,
Mississippi's Hotel Chester

12:07.112 --> 12:10.759
and I've been waiting for my
lunch for a very long time.

12:10.759 --> 12:14.062
(gentle upbeat music)

12:17.320 --> 12:18.902
- [Lindsey] Dammit.

12:18.902 --> 12:22.204
(gentle upbeat music)

12:26.514 --> 12:29.968
- Oh, jeez, I nodded off then, my God!

12:29.968 --> 12:31.720
Does the sushI usually take this long?

12:31.720 --> 12:33.472
- [Lindsey] Yes sir.
- What is this one?

12:33.472 --> 12:34.838
- The Las Vegas.

12:34.838 --> 12:35.706
- Ooh, oh my God, cream cheese?

12:35.706 --> 12:38.498
- Salmon, cream cheese and
asparagus, then it's deep-fried

12:38.498 --> 12:41.188
and comes with jalapenos.

12:41.188 --> 12:43.308
- Fried salmon with cream cheese.

12:44.690 --> 12:48.028
(Gordon munching)

12:48.028 --> 12:51.000
Disgusting.
(upbeat dramatic music)

12:51.000 --> 12:52.386
What a strange combination,

12:52.386 --> 12:53.742
very weird, it doesn't
work for me, that one.

12:53.742 --> 12:56.935
I mean, it's just greasy.

12:56.935 --> 12:58.236
- And get this out of the way?

12:58.236 --> 12:59.748
- As quick as possible.
- Okay.

12:59.748 --> 13:02.113
- [Gordon] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:02.113 --> 13:03.064
- It's dreadful.

13:03.064 --> 13:04.930
My first impressions of the food here

13:04.930 --> 13:06.727
is that it's as bad as the rooms.

13:06.727 --> 13:09.114
(upbeat dramatic music)

13:09.114 --> 13:10.591
- [Sukie] Sakura.

13:11.695 --> 13:15.246
- [Lindsey] Sakura and there's
cream cheese in the middle.

13:16.682 --> 13:17.651
- Look at that thing.

13:17.651 --> 13:19.758
So it's pretty big, right?

13:19.758 --> 13:21.909
so how are you supposed
to get it in your mouth?

13:22.823 --> 13:24.575
- I've never eaten it before.

13:24.575 --> 13:26.264
- Let's try, come on.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.350
- Me?
- We're in this together.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.357
- Oh, no, you ordered
this one all on your own.

13:30.357 --> 13:34.700
- That's yours there,
ready? Open wide, please.

13:34.700 --> 13:35.909
- [Lindsey] Wait, there is no way

13:35.909 --> 13:37.181
this is gonna fit in my mouth.

13:37.181 --> 13:38.947
- Ready? One, two, three.

13:40.354 --> 13:42.614
Ah.
- Uh-uh, I can't do it.

13:43.903 --> 13:44.918
- Now I know how my granddad feels

13:44.918 --> 13:47.848
when he puts his new teeth
in. (Lindsey chuckles)

13:47.848 --> 13:49.548
- Can I throw it away now?

13:49.548 --> 13:52.937
- Yeah. So you took one little bite?

13:52.937 --> 13:54.031
- [Lindsey] I did.

13:54.031 --> 13:57.191
- Damn, disaster, total disaster.

13:57.191 --> 13:58.849
How did it taste, by the way?

13:58.849 --> 13:59.717
- Not very good.

14:00.621 --> 14:02.957
The sakura was very chewy.

14:02.957 --> 14:06.231
Sukie does try her best,
but she has no idea

14:06.231 --> 14:07.722
what she's doing.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.882
- What's wrong with the
sakura, bland, ugly, bad?

14:10.882 --> 14:13.561
- Chewy, strange combination.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.021
- Chewy?

14:15.021 --> 14:18.149
- Yep, and impossible
to put in your mouth.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.953
- Let me tell you about my sushi,

14:19.953 --> 14:23.050
I'm not a morimoto or
nobu, absolutely not,

14:23.050 --> 14:26.105
I'm doing my best and I respect rice.

14:26.105 --> 14:27.200
- [Gordon] What is this one?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.243
- [Lindsey] Strawberry field.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.416
- Man, look at that, strawberry on sushi.

14:33.603 --> 14:35.354
On behalf of every
Japanese chef in America,

14:35.354 --> 14:37.930
I'd like to apologise, it's very weird.

14:37.930 --> 14:39.001
- [Lindsey] Which part
is so terribly weird?

14:39.001 --> 14:42.257
- Just you wouldn't cover
white tuna with strawberries

14:42.257 --> 14:43.195
and then glaze it.

14:45.364 --> 14:48.913
Strawberry fields, I'd
rather fucking eat a beatle.

14:48.913 --> 14:52.110
(gentle upbeat music)

14:52.110 --> 14:55.343
- It's too sweet, strawberries
don't belong with tuna.

14:55.343 --> 14:59.339
- I am frustrated that Gordon
does not like my sushi.

14:59.339 --> 15:01.746
I've tried all I can.

15:01.746 --> 15:04.191
(gentle upbeat music)

15:04.191 --> 15:06.411
- How are you doing, honeybun?

15:06.411 --> 15:08.377
- [Sukie] Oh, he doesn't like any.

15:08.377 --> 15:09.847
- He doesn't like any of it?

15:09.847 --> 15:12.975
- No.
(David laughs)

15:12.975 --> 15:16.176
- So, truthfully, what
is wrong with this place?

15:16.176 --> 15:17.386
- Lack of business.

15:17.386 --> 15:19.690
- So, on an average weekend,
how many guests would you do?

15:19.690 --> 15:22.245
- On a busy weekend maybe 12 people.

15:22.245 --> 15:23.944
- Are they in-house
guests, the hotel guests?

15:23.944 --> 15:25.123
- [Lindsey] Usually.

15:25.123 --> 15:27.291
- So virtually, nobody from the outside?

15:27.291 --> 15:28.160
- [Lindsey] Correct.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.911
- Jesus. Anyway, where are the owners?

15:31.911 --> 15:33.127
Can you tell me where they are?

15:33.127 --> 15:34.029
- Sure!

15:34.029 --> 15:35.758
- Thank you.

15:35.758 --> 15:38.928
- They've got just 36
bedrooms, yet on a busy night,

15:38.928 --> 15:41.076
just 12 guests eat here.

15:41.076 --> 15:43.846
With food that bad, I'm not surprised.

15:43.846 --> 15:45.268
(upbeat dramatic music)

15:45.268 --> 15:48.563
Congratulations on the
longest lunch I've ever had

15:48.563 --> 15:53.373
in my entire cooking
career, that was 97 minutes,

15:54.642 --> 15:55.778
and half of it was raw.

15:55.778 --> 15:59.157
As a novice cook, why are
you making sushi? It's crazy!

15:59.157 --> 16:03.849
- I'm trying my best to at
least introduce Mississippi,

16:03.849 --> 16:05.267
let's eat a little bit healthier.

16:05.267 --> 16:07.206
- There's nothing healthier with my lunch.

16:07.206 --> 16:08.405
Maybe a health warning.

16:09.740 --> 16:12.409
Surely you should be giving
the locals what they wanna eat,

16:12.409 --> 16:13.692
that's why they come.

16:13.692 --> 16:15.962
Well, talking to Lindsey,
the only customers we get now

16:15.962 --> 16:17.571
are the ones staying in the hotel,

16:17.571 --> 16:21.804
which is practically no one!
The business is on its arse.

16:21.804 --> 16:23.934
And how much debt are you in?

16:24.891 --> 16:27.073
- Over $900,000.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.961
- $900,000?

16:28.961 --> 16:31.060
- Right.

16:31.060 --> 16:32.575
- We are in debt?

16:32.575 --> 16:34.348
- Please don't say you don't know.

16:35.633 --> 16:38.630
(upbeat music)

16:38.630 --> 16:40.281
(electricity buzzing)

16:40.281 --> 16:43.221
So far, Starkville,
Mississippi's Hotel Chester

16:43.221 --> 16:44.723
has been a massive letdown.

16:44.723 --> 16:46.871
Hotel Chester entrance, wow.

16:46.871 --> 16:49.999
Such a huge building and such a tiny sign.

16:49.999 --> 16:52.095
The dated, soulless rooms are awful.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.556
It's like a cheap motel chain!

16:54.556 --> 16:58.740
Strawberry on sushi. The sushI
is the worst I've ever had.

16:59.785 --> 17:00.653
That is hideous.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.595
And David, the co-owner,
has just admitted to me

17:02.595 --> 17:06.102
and to his wife that they're
almost $1 million in debt.

17:06.102 --> 17:06.970
$900,000?

17:07.864 --> 17:08.732
- Right.

17:10.113 --> 17:10.982
- We are in debt?

17:10.982 --> 17:12.765
- Please don't say you don't know.

17:15.170 --> 17:19.209
- I'm deeply sorry and
I'm sad that you're upset.

17:20.425 --> 17:21.875
- I'm not upset at you.

17:21.875 --> 17:26.775
David should not have been
hiding the financial status

17:26.775 --> 17:27.644
from me.

17:28.663 --> 17:30.654
- [Gordon] Finding out
she's been kept in the dark

17:30.654 --> 17:32.406
has angered Sukie.

17:32.406 --> 17:35.086
- Dave, I don't know what we are doing!

17:35.086 --> 17:39.048
I do the spending side and
you do the paying side!

17:39.048 --> 17:41.509
- I don't share the finances with Sukie-

17:41.509 --> 17:42.844
- This is getting ridiculous.

17:42.844 --> 17:45.388
- 'Cause I'm afraid of
hurting Sukie's feelings.

17:45.388 --> 17:46.535
Calm down.

17:46.535 --> 17:48.120
- No, I'm not gonna calm down.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.579
- [Gordon] While the owners argue,

17:49.579 --> 17:51.196
guests who have heard about my visit

17:51.196 --> 17:52.968
are arriving at the Chester.

17:52.968 --> 17:54.366
- For dinner you're just
gonna go to the restaurant

17:54.366 --> 17:57.706
which is just a straight shoot
right back there, all right?

17:57.706 --> 17:58.575
- Okay.
- Thank you.

17:58.575 --> 18:00.465
- And tonight, the restaurant and hotel

18:00.465 --> 18:02.822
will be full of people for
the first time in years.

18:02.822 --> 18:04.793
I feel sorry for all of them.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.388
How long have you actually been waiting?

18:06.388 --> 18:07.639
- I would say at least 45 minutes.

18:07.639 --> 18:10.069
- 45 minutes, my apologies.

18:10.069 --> 18:11.612
- How long have you
been waiting? I'm sorry.

18:11.612 --> 18:12.665
- We've been here about an hour.

18:12.665 --> 18:14.137
- [Gordon] An hour.

18:14.137 --> 18:15.319
- Mm.
- Yeah.

18:15.319 --> 18:16.187
- I'm sorry.

18:16.187 --> 18:17.993
I've never seen anything like this before,

18:17.993 --> 18:19.922
it's insane how long
these guests are waiting.

18:19.922 --> 18:22.167
So what table's this Sukie?

18:25.553 --> 18:26.905
- Oh, pardon me, I'm sorry?

18:26.905 --> 18:28.817
- No, I just asked what
table you're doing?

18:28.817 --> 18:32.428
- The very first table.

18:33.926 --> 18:35.427
- It's been well over an hour

18:35.427 --> 18:38.535
and Sukie is only working
on the first table.

18:38.535 --> 18:41.371
She's really struggling and
yet David's not stepping in

18:41.371 --> 18:42.239
to lend a hand.

18:42.239 --> 18:45.719
(upbeat dramatic music)

18:45.719 --> 18:49.525
So, you know, over an hour in to service,

18:49.525 --> 18:51.631
would you go in and help her?

18:51.631 --> 18:55.932
I would but, that's just not
my territory, unfortunately.

18:55.932 --> 19:00.192
- Right, it's like the hotel's
falling apart around you.

19:00.192 --> 19:02.726
If someone needs you in
the kitchen, in the bar,

19:02.726 --> 19:05.176
the reception, shouldn't
you be multitasking?

19:05.176 --> 19:06.636
- The kitchen is her territory.

19:06.636 --> 19:08.520
- Okay, well, I'm just
asking, it's your hotel.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.228
- No, I know and I appreciate that.

19:10.228 --> 19:11.213
- [Gordon] Yeah.

19:11.213 --> 19:13.205
If the kitchen's not David's territory

19:13.205 --> 19:14.553
then maybe the rooms are.

19:16.779 --> 19:17.648
- I touched the blinds and
there's dust all over it.

19:17.648 --> 19:20.168
- [Guest] Squalor, it's hard.

19:21.341 --> 19:22.568
- There's a beat-up family.

19:22.568 --> 19:24.768
It's like it came out of
someone's house when they died.

19:24.768 --> 19:27.365
- This is definitely not a
place I'd wanna hang out.

19:27.365 --> 19:29.388
- [Gordon] It seems to me
that David has checked out.

19:29.388 --> 19:31.848
I don't understand what's going on here.

19:31.848 --> 19:33.392
- This is not good, okay?

19:33.392 --> 19:35.112
- [Gordon] Sukie is
totally out of her depth,

19:35.112 --> 19:36.530
having only dealt with one

19:36.530 --> 19:39.484
of the eight tables waiting
for food. Jesus Christ.

19:39.484 --> 19:42.578
- Oh, no, this is awful!

19:42.578 --> 19:45.039
- Mom?
- Wow. What's wrong, darling?

19:45.039 --> 19:46.825
- They said it wasn't cooked.

19:48.105 --> 19:51.858
- Yep, it's cold. Yeah,
that needs more cooking.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.036
- Mom?

19:53.036 --> 19:54.020
- What's wrong?

19:54.911 --> 19:56.475
- It's not cooked.

19:57.431 --> 19:59.893
- [Gordon] You okay?

19:59.893 --> 20:03.746
- [Meghan] I don't even
wanna get her in trouble.

20:03.746 --> 20:05.362
- Why has she burst into tears?

20:06.581 --> 20:08.260
You okay?
- [Meghan] I'm fine.

20:08.260 --> 20:09.507
- Help me understand. what's going on?

20:09.507 --> 20:11.013
- No, I just-

20:11.013 --> 20:11.881
- The fish is undercooked in the centre.

20:11.881 --> 20:15.098
- I know, it's just I don't-

20:15.098 --> 20:17.926
- Don't what? What is it?

20:17.926 --> 20:18.794
I'm missing, the point?

20:18.794 --> 20:21.700
I don't understand why she's
in there playing head chef.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.619
- Because we don't have anyone else!

20:23.619 --> 20:26.215
I mean, she became chef

20:26.215 --> 20:29.315
when my dad was in a car accident in 2008.

20:30.626 --> 20:33.254
- He was bedridden for about six months

20:33.254 --> 20:36.048
and then moved in to run
the hotel the next day.

20:36.048 --> 20:37.914
My mom became a chef overnight.

20:37.914 --> 20:40.928
She came to the hotel,

20:40.928 --> 20:43.483
saw where she thought she was needed

20:43.483 --> 20:45.578
and jumped in the kitchen.

20:45.578 --> 20:49.753
And ever since she's been
trying to make it work.

20:49.753 --> 20:51.876
- And so how long has it
been functioning like this?

20:51.876 --> 20:54.295
- And I think it's been in this stage

20:54.295 --> 20:57.267
for about two or three years.

20:57.267 --> 21:01.104
My dad has taken a step back
and given up a little bit.

21:01.104 --> 21:03.196
- Okay, we have to be
strong. Get some fresh air.

21:03.196 --> 21:04.139
- I am.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.125
- Get your eyes nice and bright, okay?

21:05.125 --> 21:07.673
- Okay, thanks. (chuckles)

21:07.673 --> 21:09.258
- Finally, I get it,

21:09.258 --> 21:11.584
the Hotel Chester has been in a tailspin

21:11.584 --> 21:13.200
since David's car accident.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.316
I wish Sukie or David had told me.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.712
Wow, the beer garden, interesting.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.594
Sukie is just trying to make
this work as best she can,

21:21.594 --> 21:23.470
but she's failing miserably.

21:23.470 --> 21:26.317
And David has hotel knowledge,
but since the accident

21:26.317 --> 21:27.850
he has taken a backseat.

21:27.850 --> 21:29.497
This whole place feels lost,

21:29.497 --> 21:31.531
the owners, the restaurant, the bedrooms,

21:31.531 --> 21:33.428
even this garden feels abandoned,

21:33.428 --> 21:34.711
just like the dinner guests.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.775
The customers are getting so pissed off,

21:36.775 --> 21:39.122
I'm gonna have to do
something otherwise this place

21:39.122 --> 21:40.199
is gonna go crazy.

21:43.849 --> 21:45.232
(electricity buzzes)

21:45.232 --> 21:47.588
The Hotel Chester in
Starkville, Mississippi

21:47.588 --> 21:49.757
is on the brink of financial disaster

21:49.757 --> 21:51.655
and I've finally found out why.

21:51.655 --> 21:54.032
- My dad was in a car accident in 2008.

21:54.032 --> 21:57.077
- David's car accident sent
the hotel into a sharp decline.

21:57.077 --> 21:58.631
- Oh, no!

21:58.631 --> 22:00.497
- Sukie is drowning in the kitchen,

22:00.497 --> 22:02.009
trying to keep the business afloat.

22:02.009 --> 22:03.406
How long have you actually been waiting?

22:03.406 --> 22:05.106
- I would say at least 45 minutes.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.430
- We've been here about an hour.

22:06.430 --> 22:07.299
(David yawns)

22:07.299 --> 22:10.351
- While her husband David
isn't taking the reins,

22:10.351 --> 22:11.708
I can't see the diners starve,

22:11.708 --> 22:14.668
so I've dashed over to
the local supermarket.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.409
The least I can do to help poor Sukie

22:16.409 --> 22:19.433
is to cook up a few sliders
before the customers walk out.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.895
If those diners are gonna
get any food, trust me,

22:23.895 --> 22:26.027
tonight it's coming from me.

22:26.027 --> 22:30.040
That is ridiculous in there,
an hour for appetisers, crazy.

22:32.816 --> 22:33.770
So sorry about the delay.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.424
- Oh, thank you!
- There's a little beef slider

22:35.424 --> 22:36.896
from the barbecue in the garden.

22:36.896 --> 22:38.535
I don't want you guys weltering away.

22:38.535 --> 22:39.515
Everybody got some food now?

22:39.515 --> 22:41.023
- [Dinner] Yes.
- [Gordon] Feel a bit better?

22:41.023 --> 22:41.986
- [Dinner] Yes (laughs).

22:41.986 --> 22:43.530
- The burgers have
brought Sukie enough time

22:43.530 --> 22:45.083
to get through the rest of dinner service

22:45.083 --> 22:46.661
without anyone walking out.

22:48.462 --> 22:51.986
after a long three hours,
everyone has finally been fed.

22:51.986 --> 22:54.155
I'm sure Sukie is as relieved as me

22:54.155 --> 22:55.962
that dinner service is over.

22:55.962 --> 22:57.408
(guest chattering)

22:57.408 --> 22:58.534
How are you, Sukie?

22:58.534 --> 22:59.577
- Fine, fine.
- You're fine?

22:59.577 --> 23:00.446
- Yes.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.152
- That was a tough one.

23:02.152 --> 23:03.164
- It was very tough.

23:03.164 --> 23:04.032
- [Gordon] Yeah?
- Yes sir.

23:04.032 --> 23:06.428
- Why don't you guys get
out of here, you go home?

23:06.428 --> 23:07.919
Let's hook up first
thing tomorrow morning.

23:07.919 --> 23:09.462
How far is home away from here?

23:09.462 --> 23:11.311
- This is our home now, we've got a room.

23:11.311 --> 23:13.268
- What do you mean this is your home?

23:13.268 --> 23:14.842
- We live here.

23:14.842 --> 23:15.906
- You live onsite?

23:15.906 --> 23:17.272
- Yes.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.586
- You have an apartment here?

23:18.586 --> 23:21.036
- No, right in there
there's the handicap room.

23:21.954 --> 23:23.900
That's our home now.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.989
- You live in the handicap room?

23:25.989 --> 23:26.875
- Yes.

23:26.875 --> 23:27.814
- Can you show me?

23:28.961 --> 23:32.266
- Since Dave's accident
I gave up everything.

23:32.266 --> 23:34.591
We had no money so we had no choice

23:34.591 --> 23:36.906
but to live in this room.

23:36.906 --> 23:39.438
- [Gordon] You live in here?
- [Sukie] Yes.

23:39.438 --> 23:41.483
- There's not even a fucking window!

23:41.483 --> 23:42.748
- No.

23:42.748 --> 23:45.832
- [Gordon] Sukie, I had no
idea things were this bad.

23:45.832 --> 23:48.539
- Well, have to do what you have to do.

23:48.539 --> 23:49.710
- [Gordon] I'm so sorry.

23:49.710 --> 23:54.924
- Well, you know, sometimes
you have the bad times.

23:58.313 --> 23:59.268
- Could you get David, please?

23:59.268 --> 24:00.137
- Okay.

24:01.352 --> 24:05.382
I don't know what else to
do, we have two children.

24:05.382 --> 24:08.990
I would like for them not to have to worry

24:08.990 --> 24:10.286
about their mom and dad.

24:11.910 --> 24:15.799
- Okay, so you were running this hotel,

24:15.799 --> 24:16.817
this was your baby, David?

24:16.817 --> 24:18.906
- That's right, yes.

24:18.906 --> 24:23.859
- And sadly you got involved
in a tragic car accident.

24:23.859 --> 24:25.007
- Yes.

24:25.007 --> 24:26.632
- What happened?

24:26.632 --> 24:29.552
- Legs.
- I broke both of my ankles

24:29.552 --> 24:32.058
and my back in two places.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.607
- We nearly lost him.

24:36.820 --> 24:39.114
- I mean, I was pretty busted up

24:39.114 --> 24:43.410
so I've been spending most
of the past five years

24:43.410 --> 24:44.393
just recovering.

24:46.069 --> 24:47.987
- [Gordon] why did you sell your house?

24:47.987 --> 24:50.636
- We couldn't make the payment and-

24:50.636 --> 24:52.690
- You foreclosed?
- [David] Yes.

24:52.690 --> 24:55.161
- That's terrible, I'm
sorry, I didn't know that.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.894
And you come home every
night now into this bedroom?

24:58.894 --> 25:00.458
- [David] Mm-hm.

25:00.458 --> 25:04.100
- This is awful, it is no way to live.

25:06.599 --> 25:09.980
I think you deserve something better.

25:09.980 --> 25:14.159
I promise I'm gonna help
you fix this place, okay?

25:14.159 --> 25:18.022
- Yes sir. Thank you Gordon, thank you.

25:18.022 --> 25:19.877
- Will you get some rest, please?

25:20.895 --> 25:22.762
- Sometimes I will go seven days

25:22.762 --> 25:27.975
without stepping out of
the hotel and it's sad.

25:28.445 --> 25:30.530
- I can't believe David and Sukie

25:30.530 --> 25:32.261
have been living like this for years.

25:32.261 --> 25:34.784
I've never wanted to
help two people so badly.

25:34.784 --> 25:36.539
I just hope I'm not too late.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.153
(electricity buzzing)

25:40.153 --> 25:42.847
(gentle music)

25:45.634 --> 25:49.109
Oh, man, that was a rough night's sleep.

25:51.238 --> 25:53.021
I couldn't stop thinking
about David and Sukie

25:53.021 --> 25:55.920
downstairs where they
are, almost cooped up

25:55.920 --> 25:58.954
in that tiny room with no windows.

25:58.954 --> 26:00.789
I mean, my sleep was rough but, Christ,

26:00.789 --> 26:03.573
can you imagine going
through that for three years,

26:03.573 --> 26:05.328
like they've been doing, God.

26:08.547 --> 26:11.926
David and Sukie have sunk
so far they have lost sight

26:11.926 --> 26:13.500
of the outside world.

26:13.500 --> 26:17.066
If they lose this hotel
they may lose everything.

26:17.066 --> 26:19.183
I need to show them the
potential of this place

26:19.183 --> 26:20.340
before it's too late.

26:20.340 --> 26:21.636
It's like a sink.

26:24.766 --> 26:27.895
Maybe if I turn that way.

26:27.895 --> 26:28.977
Come on!

26:28.977 --> 26:31.584
This is ridiculous, I
can't even get my feet wet!

26:35.032 --> 26:36.513
David and Sukie need to see

26:36.513 --> 26:40.590
how to make the Hotel Chester
a success. I've got a plan.

26:40.590 --> 26:44.761
You've let this business
swallow the both of you up.

26:44.761 --> 26:45.629
- Yeah.

26:45.629 --> 26:48.921
- It is like quicksand.
You've lost your way.

26:48.921 --> 26:51.069
Not only have you lost the
connection with each other,

26:51.069 --> 26:53.780
but you've lost the connection
out there, out there.

26:55.115 --> 26:57.982
The town, the students, the community.

26:57.982 --> 26:59.487
Both of you, come with me,
I've got something to show you

26:59.487 --> 27:01.676
that can save the life of your hotel.

27:02.816 --> 27:05.321
(gentle music)

27:05.321 --> 27:06.311
In the car, please.

27:08.350 --> 27:09.254
(car starts)

27:09.254 --> 27:11.193
When was the last time you
two went out for lunch?

27:11.193 --> 27:13.362
- I can't remember, too long.
- I can't remember.

27:13.362 --> 27:15.958
- You've never been
out for lunch together?

27:15.958 --> 27:17.022
- [Sukie] No.
- [David] No.

27:17.022 --> 27:18.138
- Wow.

27:18.138 --> 27:20.296
I want to show David and
Sukie a couple of places

27:20.296 --> 27:23.695
that are extremely successful
because they tap in

27:23.695 --> 27:25.155
to what the community wants.

27:26.883 --> 27:30.098
(car doors slumming)

27:31.119 --> 27:32.143
Thank you, darling, (indistinct).

27:32.143 --> 27:34.237
Oh, wow, at lunch are
you always this busy?

27:34.237 --> 27:36.037
- [Waitress] It's
usually busier, actually.

27:36.037 --> 27:38.367
- On an average weekend, for instance,

27:38.367 --> 27:40.166
in the middle of summer
how many covers do you do?

27:40.166 --> 27:42.649
- (sighs) Hundreds and thousands probably.

27:42.649 --> 27:45.311
I mean, it gets so slam-packed.

27:45.311 --> 27:46.179
- Excellent, thanks, honey.

27:46.179 --> 27:47.132
- [Waitress] You're welcome.
- Thank you, sweetie.

27:47.132 --> 27:50.017
Can you believe 1000 people a day here?

27:50.017 --> 27:51.929
- Mm, envious.
- A day.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.695
Good, honest Mississippian food.

27:55.695 --> 27:56.933
- I just want 10%.

27:56.933 --> 27:58.248
- You just want 100 people a day, 10%?

27:58.248 --> 28:01.285
- Yeah, that would be, oh.

28:01.285 --> 28:04.604
I did not know that there were
that many people eating out.

28:05.655 --> 28:07.520
(gentle music)

28:07.520 --> 28:09.783
- I've got one more place
to show David and Sukie

28:09.783 --> 28:12.640
to really make sure they see
there are plenty of businesses

28:12.640 --> 28:14.910
doing well in the town.
How cool is this place?

28:14.910 --> 28:18.083
- [Sukie] Oh, this is really popular.

28:18.083 --> 28:19.067
- You know, since my accident

28:19.067 --> 28:20.565
I really haven't gotten around town much.

28:20.565 --> 28:23.964
- You know, this business is 100 metres

28:23.964 --> 28:25.559
from your front door.

28:25.559 --> 28:27.762
Thank you. Now, there you are, darling.

28:27.762 --> 28:29.853
Please, how many covers
do you do in a day?

28:29.853 --> 28:31.711
What's the numbers?

28:31.711 --> 28:33.108
- About 200 a day.
- 200 a day.

28:33.108 --> 28:36.268
- 200 customers and weekends
generally double that.

28:36.268 --> 28:38.228
- Mm, so an average of 200 guests a day,

28:38.228 --> 28:41.461
400 at the weekends. And
families as well early evenings?

28:41.461 --> 28:42.329
- Families, yes.

28:42.329 --> 28:45.068
A lot of our business revolves
around college students.

28:45.068 --> 28:46.737
- Thank you.

28:46.737 --> 28:48.488
The purpose of this outing is to show you

28:48.488 --> 28:51.554
how these businesses are
drawing from the university,

28:51.554 --> 28:54.244
how they are open to every market,

28:54.244 --> 28:56.830
and it does translate to the rooms.

28:56.830 --> 28:58.704
You have a potential goldmine sat there,

28:58.704 --> 29:02.742
you have the traffic, you've
gotta tap in to the community.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.371
That's what you're not doing.

29:04.371 --> 29:07.187
- I'm convinced, that's correct.

29:08.060 --> 29:10.615
- I thought we were
always welcoming students,

29:10.615 --> 29:15.651
maybe we are wrong. So that's
definitely an eye-opener.

29:15.651 --> 29:17.246
- Now that I've shown David and Sukie

29:17.246 --> 29:19.530
how much potential there is in Starkville,

29:19.530 --> 29:23.388
I need them to commit to turning
the Hotel Chester around.

29:23.388 --> 29:24.538
That was nice, I enjoyed that.

29:24.538 --> 29:25.929
- It was. Yeah, I did too.
- Thank you, very nice.

29:25.929 --> 29:28.301
- To see it that busy
for lunch was incredible.

29:28.301 --> 29:31.007
- The business is booming there.

29:31.007 --> 29:32.512
- [Gordon] David, you
need to get your head

29:32.512 --> 29:33.544
back in the game.

29:33.544 --> 29:34.412
- That's right.

29:34.412 --> 29:37.548
- I've got some great ideas, but you two

29:37.548 --> 29:39.334
have to be ready for change.

29:40.332 --> 29:45.035
- [David] Gordon, whatever
direction you help us to get on,

29:45.035 --> 29:47.403
we're not gonna waiver off of that.

29:47.403 --> 29:48.792
- No, we're not.

29:50.532 --> 29:53.178
(electricity buzzes)

29:53.178 --> 29:54.784
- [Gordon] When I arrived at Starkville,

29:54.784 --> 29:57.422
Mississippi's Hotel
Chester, it was invisible

29:57.422 --> 29:58.694
on the main street.

29:58.694 --> 30:00.289
Hotel Chester entrance,

30:00.289 --> 30:03.636
wow, such a huge building
and such a tiny sign!

30:03.636 --> 30:05.357
And failing to appeal to the people

30:05.357 --> 30:08.141
who could make it a success,
the college students,

30:08.141 --> 30:11.822
I'm convinced Sukie and David
are no ready for change.

30:11.822 --> 30:15.012
- [David] Whatever direction
you help us to get on,

30:15.012 --> 30:16.986
we're not gonna waiver off of that.

30:19.340 --> 30:21.456
- So now it's time to reveal the new hotel

30:21.456 --> 30:24.091
to David and Sukie and their team.

30:24.091 --> 30:26.936
- Oh, my God, look at that! Aah!

30:26.936 --> 30:30.538
(David laughing)
- Oh, my God! (clapping)

30:30.538 --> 30:31.558
- Sure as hell, don't have to
worry about finding it now!

30:31.558 --> 30:34.490
- Oh, that's wonderful, we have a sign!

30:34.490 --> 30:35.710
- Come on.

30:35.710 --> 30:38.797
- Welcome to the new Hotel Chester.

30:38.797 --> 30:41.695
You're no longer hidden
on the main street.

30:41.695 --> 30:46.064
Now, customers, locals, will
identify that it is a hotel.

30:46.064 --> 30:47.722
Is it big enough for you, David?

30:47.722 --> 30:48.591
- [David] Oh, yeah.

30:48.591 --> 30:49.459
- I think it's really, really great.

30:49.459 --> 30:53.113
- That there is the biggest
marketing tool you'll ever need.

30:53.113 --> 30:53.982
- [David] I love it.

30:53.982 --> 30:56.173
- Ah! Ah, this is so good!

30:58.170 --> 30:59.612
- Shall we have a look inside?

30:59.612 --> 31:00.631
- Yeah.

31:00.631 --> 31:03.571
I'm looking forward to
seeing what Gordon has done

31:03.571 --> 31:05.086
with the inside of the hotel.

31:05.086 --> 31:06.631
- Are you ready?

31:06.631 --> 31:08.071
- Oh, Gordon!
- Oh my God.

31:08.071 --> 31:09.998
- Oh, my-
(upbeat dramatic music)

31:09.998 --> 31:11.389
- [Meghan] Oh, my God!

31:11.389 --> 31:13.331
(David laughing)

31:13.331 --> 31:14.200
- Wow.

31:14.200 --> 31:15.823
- Jump in. go in, go in, go in, please.

31:15.823 --> 31:18.624
- This is definitely
lovely, lovely, lovely.

31:18.624 --> 31:19.622
- Yes, I love it.

31:19.622 --> 31:21.756
- [Gordon] Gone is the
drab and the dullness.

31:21.756 --> 31:25.938
Now this room has character.
Isn't this beautiful?

31:25.938 --> 31:27.810
- I'm genuinely thrilled,

31:27.810 --> 31:30.765
if I could I'd do a somersault backwards

31:30.765 --> 31:33.883
and then, if Gordon would
let me, I'd kiss him.

31:33.883 --> 31:35.875
Even if he doesn't, I may drag him in

31:35.875 --> 31:40.191
and give him a big ole kiss
right on the damn lips. (laughs)

31:40.191 --> 31:42.743
- [Gordon] Meghan, nice
to see that you're happy.

31:42.743 --> 31:44.675
- [Meghan] I'm very happy.
(Gordon Chuckles)

31:44.675 --> 31:46.760
It's more than I can have
hoped for and it seems to be

31:46.760 --> 31:49.941
the beginning of the end of our struggle.

31:49.941 --> 31:53.726
- Do you think the parents
of those 20,000 students

31:54.664 --> 31:56.572
in the university will
wanna stay here now?

31:56.572 --> 31:57.455
- Yes.

31:57.455 --> 31:58.793
- [Gordon] Right, like
to see one more room?

31:58.793 --> 32:00.548
- [Team] Yes.
- Yeah? Let's go.

32:00.548 --> 32:02.079
- All right.
(upbeat music)

32:02.079 --> 32:04.062
- Oh, my God!

32:04.062 --> 32:05.998
- [Lady] Oh, my God!

32:05.998 --> 32:07.250
- [David] Damn I love this room!

32:07.250 --> 32:08.345
- [Gordon] Beautiful!

32:09.731 --> 32:11.423
- I'm in a dream, wonderful,

32:11.423 --> 32:15.161
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
I mean, I can't ask more.

32:15.161 --> 32:17.538
- Sukie, this is not a chain
hotel this is your hotel.

32:17.538 --> 32:18.407
- No, no, that's right. Ah!

32:18.407 --> 32:20.448
- Like I said, something to be proud of.

32:20.448 --> 32:21.471
- That's awesome.

32:21.471 --> 32:22.661
- I've got something else to show you.

32:22.661 --> 32:25.964
This one you're gonna
absolutely love, ready?

32:25.964 --> 32:28.309
- So excited! (claps)

32:28.309 --> 32:32.160
(bright upbeat music)

32:32.160 --> 32:33.029
- [Lady] Oh, look!

32:33.029 --> 32:34.610
- Please, I'd like to welcome you all

32:34.610 --> 32:36.206
to your stunning beer garden.

32:36.206 --> 32:37.074
- There we go!

32:37.074 --> 32:39.677
- Ah, look at that! Oh, my God!

32:39.677 --> 32:40.697
- Wow.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.618
- Oh.
- Oh, yes!

32:42.618 --> 32:44.881
- This is what I call a beer garden, okay?

32:44.881 --> 32:47.133
- [David] Damn!
- [Woman] Oh, yeah!

32:47.133 --> 32:49.323
- Modern benches, so we have
communal benches as well,

32:49.323 --> 32:51.335
large parties, have families,

32:51.335 --> 32:53.692
additional space up there as
well we've taken advantage of,

32:53.692 --> 32:54.561
stunning furniture.

32:54.561 --> 32:56.924
- That's nice, beautiful, I love it.

32:56.924 --> 32:58.405
- If you go into the gazebo,

32:58.405 --> 33:01.168
we have the most amazing local beers.

33:01.168 --> 33:02.037
- Oh, my God!

33:03.431 --> 33:05.296
- [Gordon] Craft beers on tap.

33:05.296 --> 33:06.587
- [Dinner] Oh, God, this is a fine place!

33:06.587 --> 33:07.623
- And these are stunning craft beers

33:07.623 --> 33:12.523
that can rotate local beers
to promote stuff locally.

33:12.523 --> 33:13.597
- That's awesome.

33:13.597 --> 33:17.049
The beer garden is awesome,
I'm gonna christen it myself

33:17.049 --> 33:19.051
and somebody's gonna have
to carry me out of it

33:19.051 --> 33:21.887
before we open the doors to the public.

33:21.887 --> 33:24.629
- There's one more thing
I'd like to show you.

33:24.629 --> 33:25.849
Please come with me.

33:25.849 --> 33:26.881
- Yes, all right.

33:26.881 --> 33:28.268
- Love this garden out here!

33:28.268 --> 33:30.395
(upbeat dramatic music)

33:30.395 --> 33:32.001
- Welcome to the new Hotel Chester's

33:32.001 --> 33:34.368
stunning beer garden's food!

33:34.368 --> 33:36.255
- This hotel is in a vibrant college town

33:36.255 --> 33:37.475
in the heart of Mississippi,

33:37.475 --> 33:40.218
so I've created a menu that
will attract a younger crowd

33:40.218 --> 33:42.543
and highlight southern comfort food.

33:42.543 --> 33:45.426
Gone is the fusion confusion.

33:45.426 --> 33:47.485
(Megan chuckles)
Sukie, I'm sorry, all gone.

33:47.485 --> 33:48.354
- Good.

33:48.354 --> 33:51.051
- Southern food fits the location.

33:51.051 --> 33:52.741
How can we be in Starkville

33:52.741 --> 33:55.337
and not have stunning
fried green tomatoes?

33:55.337 --> 33:57.412
Next to that we have
oyster and bacon po-boy:

33:57.412 --> 33:59.341
fried crispy oysters, crispy bacon,

33:59.341 --> 34:01.437
with a stunning spicy remoulade.

34:01.437 --> 34:03.916
And Gordon's burger, he's a chef

34:03.916 --> 34:06.192
and he, from time to time, comes up

34:06.192 --> 34:07.870
with some stunning recipes with burgers.

34:07.870 --> 34:11.206
This burger recipe is featured
at planet Hollywood in Vegas

34:11.206 --> 34:12.562
and it is to die for.

34:12.562 --> 34:15.868
- The new menu complements
the state of Mississippi

34:15.868 --> 34:18.339
and it really suits the beer garden.

34:18.339 --> 34:20.404
Wonderful, wonderful idea.

34:20.404 --> 34:21.905
- Sukie, I have something for you

34:21.905 --> 34:23.688
that's gonna make your life in the kitchen

34:23.688 --> 34:26.913
a whole lot easier, bear
with me one second, please.

34:29.350 --> 34:32.346
Now, I've got someone I'd
like to introduce you to,

34:33.333 --> 34:35.960
someone very special with
two unique assistants.

34:35.960 --> 34:39.380
Come through, please. Say
hello to Enrique Williams.

34:39.380 --> 34:42.342
Now, she'll be Hotel
Chester's new head chef.

34:42.342 --> 34:44.344
This lady is a very experienced chef

34:44.344 --> 34:47.003
and she absolutely knows her stuff.

34:47.003 --> 34:48.956
I'm covering Enrique's salary.

34:50.277 --> 34:52.853
I'm taking care of that
until this place picks up

34:52.853 --> 34:56.072
and you can afford to keep
her yourself. You kiss her.

34:58.963 --> 35:02.185
- Having Sukie in the kitchen
broke my heart every day,

35:02.185 --> 35:06.418
so I'm really looking forward
to getting to know the chef

35:06.418 --> 35:09.223
and her apprentices and giving them

35:09.223 --> 35:11.517
all the support I possibly can.

35:11.517 --> 35:14.374
- Sukie, I want you to keep cooking,

35:14.374 --> 35:16.908
but I want you to have
a bit of fun with it.

35:16.908 --> 35:18.483
And here's how it's gonna work,

35:18.483 --> 35:22.476
Sukie's robata grill skewers,
chicken, beef shrimp,

35:22.476 --> 35:25.393
with garlic ginger soy marinade.

35:25.393 --> 35:27.971
- That robata, the personal touch.

35:27.971 --> 35:30.557
I love it, I love the change.

35:30.557 --> 35:32.966
- Robata is classic Japanese barbecue.

35:32.966 --> 35:34.092
When you think of robata grill

35:34.092 --> 35:38.596
you think marinated Japanese
style, it's easy to execute,

35:38.596 --> 35:40.244
and do you know what, it
cuts a little bit of slack

35:40.244 --> 35:41.954
in the kitchen, it gives
the kitchen a bit of time.

35:41.954 --> 35:44.780
Now, all of you, sit
down and tuck in, please.

35:44.780 --> 35:45.705
- [Zach] Thank you so much!

35:45.705 --> 35:49.359
- [David] Thanks Gordon!
That looks so damn good.

35:49.359 --> 35:51.745
- [Sukie] Doesn't it?

35:51.745 --> 35:52.913
- [Gordon] With word out to the locals

35:52.913 --> 35:55.384
and the college students
about the Chester's new vibe,

35:55.384 --> 35:57.110
this hotel is ready for business.

35:57.110 --> 35:58.126
- Well how are we all doing,

35:58.126 --> 35:58.995
checking in?
- Yes.

35:58.995 --> 36:00.764
- Checking in for two under (indistinct).

36:00.764 --> 36:03.173
- [Gordon] As the new younger
clientele begin checking in,

36:03.173 --> 36:05.915
it's clear the renovated rooms are a hit.

36:05.915 --> 36:08.126
- [Man] This is awesome.
- How nice is this!

36:08.126 --> 36:11.859
- It feels so big and so
bright! It's just wow!

36:11.859 --> 36:13.287
- We need one of these comforters at home.

36:13.287 --> 36:15.102
- [Gordon] While the rooms
are proving to impress,

36:15.102 --> 36:17.823
the renovated beer garden
is also creating a buzz,

36:17.823 --> 36:19.521
with students, parents and locals.

36:19.521 --> 36:20.520
- We need to get a little
taste of everything.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.787
- Yeah, everyone needs to order
something different, I know.

36:23.787 --> 36:25.122
- Do you want anything form the grill?

36:25.122 --> 36:25.991
That's my little corner.

36:25.991 --> 36:27.461
- We just want one of everything.

36:27.461 --> 36:28.368
- What are drinking, buddy?
- I'll put it on your tab.

36:28.368 --> 36:31.243
- [Gordon] David seems
reinvigorated as an owner

36:31.243 --> 36:32.776
and is really getting into it.

36:32.776 --> 36:35.476
- Let me get your glasses.
Just call 'em out to me.

36:35.476 --> 36:37.353
I'm thrilled to death.

36:37.353 --> 36:40.909
Just looking out there and
seeing people eating good food

36:40.909 --> 36:44.152
and drinking good craft
beers and conversing

36:44.152 --> 36:48.375
is exactly the kind of
environment I wanted out there.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.407
- I need a burger
medium, a fish and chips-

36:50.407 --> 36:52.306
- [Chef] You got your burger.
- [Enrique] Pulled pork.

36:52.306 --> 36:53.703
- [Gordon] And without
Sukie in the kitchen,

36:53.703 --> 36:55.965
the new head chef is doing a fantastic job

36:55.965 --> 36:58.614
of making wonderful meals
and getting them out

36:58.614 --> 37:00.209
in a timely manner.

37:00.209 --> 37:03.842
- That is it for high one, so
now we're working high two.

37:03.842 --> 37:05.996
- Make him sweat, God dammit.

37:05.996 --> 37:08.092
There you go, all right, buddy.

37:08.092 --> 37:11.679
The biggest thing Gordon
has done is giving me

37:11.679 --> 37:15.433
a new sense of confidence
and an opportunity

37:15.433 --> 37:17.497
to have my wife be my wife again.

37:17.497 --> 37:20.323
- My favourite has been Gordon's hamburger

37:20.323 --> 37:21.647
and I'm not a hamburger eater.

37:21.647 --> 37:24.619
And it's fantastic and it's
a money back guarantee.

37:24.619 --> 37:26.086
I'll give your money back
if you don't like it.

37:26.086 --> 37:28.227
- Okay, thank you.

37:28.227 --> 37:29.655
- That's the best burger in Starkville

37:29.655 --> 37:30.677
without a close second.

37:30.677 --> 37:31.546
- Oh, yeah.
- It is so good!

37:31.546 --> 37:32.940
- This is the best of everything!

37:32.940 --> 37:34.556
- Now that the Hotel Chester is catering

37:34.556 --> 37:37.017
to what the locals want,
and with Sukie and David

37:37.017 --> 37:40.690
embracing the changes, I know
my job here is almost done.

37:42.001 --> 37:43.722
Time to say goodbye.

37:43.722 --> 37:44.796
- [David] Hey Gordon.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.516
- [Gordon] I'm gonna miss you both.

37:46.516 --> 37:47.746
- We're gonna miss you too.

37:47.746 --> 37:51.323
- Look after each other,
embrace these students,

37:51.323 --> 37:55.243
their parents, and get this hotel full.

37:55.243 --> 37:57.798
When I see you behind
that bar serving pints

37:57.798 --> 37:59.352
that for me is you in your element.

37:59.352 --> 38:00.220
- All right.

38:00.220 --> 38:01.089
- Take care of yourselves, okay?

38:01.089 --> 38:01.957
- Yes sir.

38:01.957 --> 38:02.834
- Well done, darling.
(lips smacking)

38:02.834 --> 38:05.441
Seeing you bouncing
around out there tonight,

38:05.441 --> 38:08.507
happy in front of customers
rather than stressed,

38:08.507 --> 38:10.957
good to see. Take care
of yourself.(sighs) Wow.

38:11.887 --> 38:14.797
(car door slams)

38:14.797 --> 38:16.089
(upbeat dramatic music)

38:16.089 --> 38:20.779
Oh damn. I'm sorry, I've
forgot one little thing.

38:20.779 --> 38:21.942
Can you come with me, please?

38:21.942 --> 38:22.865
- Yeah.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.481
- One little thing before I go.

38:27.282 --> 38:28.488
(door shuts)

38:28.488 --> 38:29.958
(electricity buzzes)

38:29.958 --> 38:31.426
(gentle upbeat music)

38:31.426 --> 38:34.241
The re-launch of the Hotel
Chester is a huge success.

38:34.241 --> 38:35.304
Can you come with me, please?

38:35.304 --> 38:36.173
- Yeah.

38:36.173 --> 38:38.631
- Now Sukie and David are on
their way to making this hotel

38:38.631 --> 38:40.872
the talk of the town.
Get in the car, please.

38:40.872 --> 38:43.743
But before I leave, I have
one more surprise for them.

38:47.337 --> 38:49.784
There's one more little
thing I wanted to show you.

38:49.784 --> 38:53.208
Isn't this place beautiful?
That gorgeous pool there.

38:53.208 --> 38:56.503
Both of you, come in for two seconds.

38:56.503 --> 38:59.196
(upbeat music)

39:02.123 --> 39:06.898
Now, living in that tiny
room with no windows

39:06.898 --> 39:12.112
is not the way to live. So
this is your new apartment.

39:14.646 --> 39:17.628
I've rented this for the
next six months and I'm sure,

39:17.628 --> 39:20.016
when the business kicks off,
you'll have sufficient funds

39:20.016 --> 39:20.884
to rent this apartment.

39:20.884 --> 39:22.487
- Oh, I don't know what
to say. Oh, I love it!

39:22.487 --> 39:24.093
- Open plan kitchen, lounge.

39:24.093 --> 39:26.449
Have a quick look and the
bedroom through there, beautiful.

39:26.449 --> 39:28.566
- This is just what we really needed

39:28.566 --> 39:32.171
for Dave and me to getaway.

39:32.171 --> 39:33.863
- (laughs) There we go.

39:33.863 --> 39:36.365
- Oh, Dave, this is nice!

39:36.365 --> 39:37.762
- [David] Ah, this is, this is nice.

39:37.762 --> 39:40.217
- [Sukie] This is so sweet!

39:40.217 --> 39:45.431
- You need some time out.
- Thank you! Thank you!

39:45.716 --> 39:46.939
- That is yours.

39:46.939 --> 39:48.440
- Thank you so much!

39:48.440 --> 39:50.977
- Thank you, thank you
again, that's awesome.

39:51.923 --> 39:55.833
I'm just damn flabbergasted, actually.

39:55.833 --> 40:01.046
- Being onsite and not having
time out of your hotel,

40:01.630 --> 40:04.352
you were blind to the
potential on your doorstep,

40:04.352 --> 40:05.964
was ridiculous.

40:05.964 --> 40:06.832
- Thank you.

40:06.832 --> 40:08.408
We thought Gordon was just coming here

40:08.408 --> 40:13.392
to help us with the business,
he ended up helping us,

40:13.392 --> 40:15.749
emotionally, our marriage.

40:15.749 --> 40:18.752
He very much wanted for us to be together

40:18.752 --> 40:19.683
and that was so lovely.

40:19.683 --> 40:22.742
- That's pretty damn awesome,
no question about it.

40:22.742 --> 40:24.695
- Mm, really, really nice.

40:24.695 --> 40:25.564
- Yes.

40:26.730 --> 40:28.614
(both kiss)

40:28.614 --> 40:32.766
Thank you again. Now, I'm
gonna hug you too. (laughs)

40:32.766 --> 40:34.513
- This is a fantastic home.
- Take care, you, okay?

40:34.513 --> 40:38.216
- I'm gonna kiss you too. (laughs)

40:38.216 --> 40:41.941
- Spend some quality time
together, you deserve it.

40:41.941 --> 40:43.088
Goodnight and good luck.

40:43.088 --> 40:45.173
- All right, bye Gordon.
- [Gordon] Bye-bye now.

40:45.173 --> 40:46.227
(door slams)

40:46.227 --> 40:47.395
- It's a new start for me

40:47.395 --> 40:50.273
and it's definitely a new start for Sukie.

40:50.273 --> 40:52.202
- [Sukie] This is so sweet!
- [David] I'm gonna get naked

40:52.202 --> 40:53.351
in the pool right now.

40:53.351 --> 40:54.621
(Sukie laughs)

40:54.621 --> 40:58.096
- It's so nice to see
two people finally happy.

40:59.918 --> 41:04.040
Strawberries on fucking
sushi, what was she thinking?

41:07.686 --> 41:11.158
Since my visit, the Hotel
Chester's bookings have gone up.

41:11.158 --> 41:12.597
- Have y'all stayed with us before?

41:12.597 --> 41:13.595
- No, this is the first time.

41:13.595 --> 41:16.247
- And the guests are enjoying
the new improvements.

41:16.247 --> 41:18.599
- It's just not generic, run of the mill.

41:18.599 --> 41:20.814
I think this is something special now.

41:20.814 --> 41:21.962
- It does feel special.

41:21.962 --> 41:25.861
It's actually had a touch
of care given to it.

41:25.861 --> 41:26.775
(guests chattering)

41:26.775 --> 41:28.530
- [Gordon] With the new
menu and beer garden,

41:28.530 --> 41:30.970
the hotel has become a local
hit with the college kids.

41:30.970 --> 41:32.958
- I don't know what
this is but I enjoy it.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.401
- The craft beer you have?
- Uh-huh.

41:35.401 --> 41:36.517
- I mean it was outstanding, you know?

41:36.517 --> 41:37.385
- [Sukie] Was it?
- Yes,

41:37.385 --> 41:39.655
I mean, the local brewery Mississippi,

41:39.655 --> 41:41.106
plus you had a mix of everything.

41:41.106 --> 41:43.044
- Oh, so you had a sampler?

41:43.044 --> 41:44.431
- We had the sampler, it was very good.

41:44.431 --> 41:46.996
- The new buzz around town
means the Hotel Chester

41:46.996 --> 41:50.135
is now bringing in thousands
of guests every weekend,

41:50.135 --> 41:52.648
and David and Sukie are
working as a team again.

41:52.648 --> 41:56.829
- Next march 8th, we've
got booked for a reception

41:56.829 --> 41:59.467
for about 150 to 200 people so they want

41:59.467 --> 42:02.970
all of the 36 rooms for two nights.

42:02.970 --> 42:04.566
Gordon has saved us,

42:04.566 --> 42:08.199
our relationship as
husband and wife is better,

42:08.199 --> 42:10.779
we are now partners.

42:10.779 --> 42:12.432
- I wanna give you all a hug!

42:12.432 --> 42:13.385
- Come on Megan, give us a kiss.

42:13.385 --> 42:16.202
- I'm so excited.
- Come on, guys!

42:16.202 --> 42:19.935
- What Gordon has done for
us means everything to us.

42:19.935 --> 42:23.825
And I think Gordon's helped
to put the hotel on the map!

42:23.825 --> 42:24.693
Let's go suck face for a while.

42:24.693 --> 42:29.757
- 90% of the time. (laughs)

42:59.069 --> 43:00.403
- [Voice Over] One potato, two potato.

43:00.403 --> 43:03.096
(man laughing)

43:47.482 --> 43:50.610
(upbeat rock music)

44:17.676 --> 44:22.889
One potato, two potato.
(man laughing)
