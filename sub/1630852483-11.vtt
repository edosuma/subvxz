[Hwang Bi-ryeong,

01:08.100 --> 01:12.330
I took the liberty of calculating
our living expenses.

01:12.670 --> 01:16.170
Even if we lead a frugal life
paying our monthly rent,

01:16.240 --> 01:19.340
we will still need 58 nyang 36 jeon
every month.

01:19.910 --> 01:22.480
Then the three of us must earn

01:22.539 --> 01:25.450

Right.

-If I have clients, that is.
-You will.

01:35.590 --> 01:37.289
I have some things to sort out.

01:37.360 --> 01:39.660
Once I am done,
I will find work at a guild.

01:39.729 --> 01:42.030
I can read and am good with numbers,

01:42.130 --> 01:43.470
so a job will easily be offered.

-I will find work as a seamstress.
-Good.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.009
and one of them is a peddler.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.710
I will ask for a job
sewing clothes for noblewomen.

01:55.780 --> 01:58.050
I could put up a flyer at the market
about a clairvoyant fortune-teller.

01:58.180 --> 02:00.010
That sounds like a good idea.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.780
Also put one up about
a talented seamstress.

02:02.850 --> 02:05.390
-Sounds great.
-I will be the one to write them.

by the name of Jo-yi

02:58.870 --> 03:00.040
Yes, I have.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.910
Rumor has it that she matches color well.

A touch of her magic

A woman who had
100 unsuccessful blind dates

I hear you can even
make pigs look beautiful.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.550
The Minister of Personnel's daughter

03:40.620 --> 03:42.050
went on a blind date in a dress you made

03:42.220 --> 03:44.190
which led to her
finding herself a husband.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.820
Right. I was grateful to hear
about the success she had.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.600
They say one's third daughter
is the prettiest of them all,

03:53.829 --> 03:56.160

03:57.030 --> 03:59.100
If she finally gets engaged
thanks to the dress you make,

03:59.170 --> 04:01.300
I will pay you double.

04:12.550 --> 04:15.080
Tell me. Do you see any hope?

04:17.050 --> 04:18.390
Go ahead.

04:19.550 --> 04:20.660
Yes, my lady.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.890
First of all,
her dress is too baggy on her.

04:24.990 --> 04:27.800
It is why she looks like
she is hunching over.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.700
The sleeves are too long

04:29.760 --> 04:31.430
and are hiding her beautiful hands.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.770
Judging by her complexion,

04:33.870 --> 04:36.600
rather than a top in cold blueish colors,

04:36.670 --> 04:38.640
she will look better
in a warm pinkish color.

04:38.710 --> 04:41.640
To make her jaw look more V-shaped,
the collar should be deeper.

04:41.710 --> 04:43.540
And rather than a full skirt,

04:43.610 --> 04:45.450
a narrower fit

04:46.010 --> 04:48.580
will bring out her curves more.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.850
[She is ready, my lady.]

05:24.620 --> 05:26.250
Gosh, who am I looking at?

05:26.420 --> 05:27.860
Are you sure you are not an angel?

05:27.920 --> 05:30.090
You are like an angel that has descended.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.990
Goodness, thank you so much.

05:33.060 --> 05:34.800
You have saved this family.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.330
Please do not mention it.

My goodness.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.270
[Did you hear the rumors?]

05:42.340 --> 05:43.810
About the seamstress, I mean.

05:43.940 --> 05:46.010
I hear she is not from Qing.

05:46.270 --> 05:48.380
She reached us from across the galaxy.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.650
Are you saying
she is the reincarnation of Jik-nyeo?

05:52.850 --> 05:55.580
[No wonder her skills
are beyond a human's.]

05:55.650 --> 05:58.390
[-She is a supernatural being.
-Tell me about it.]

05:59.890 --> 06:01.460

06:04.930 --> 06:09.000
I could read your palms
while you wait, you know.

06:22.180 --> 06:24.580
Your husband has a woman on the side.

06:24.650 --> 06:25.780
-A woman?
-Goodness.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.620
-I see long hair.
-Long hair?

06:30.790 --> 06:32.620
-Red lips.
-Red lips?

06:35.690 --> 06:36.920
And two eyes!

06:38.760 --> 06:39.860
Two?

06:40.560 --> 06:41.430
Can you...

06:41.500 --> 06:42.930
One at a time, ladies!

06:43.030 --> 06:44.800
-Who is this wench?
-Let me see.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.000
It seems like you will have a long life.

06:47.370 --> 06:49.370
Bi-ryeong, half a nyang each!

06:51.440 --> 06:53.610
You will be blessed with children
in your later years.

06:53.670 --> 06:55.040
This is a new release.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.050
Do you see the artistry that went into it?

06:57.110 --> 06:59.409
Gosh, your compliments
are making me blush.

06:59.480 --> 07:00.820
You will soon meet your man.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.020
I will reserve these two for you.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.020
-Thank you for this rare gift.
-Thank you.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.120
-We will see you tomorrow.
-Take care.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.290
-Does this feel good?
-Yes, it does.

07:11.090 --> 07:12.490
How much did we make?

07:12.560 --> 07:14.860
You earned 20 nyang
by fortune-telling alone.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.500
Then we can go out tomorrow.

07:17.630 --> 07:20.230
-We will enjoy some bindaetteok.
-Sounds good to me.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.100
Bindaetteok? I second that!

07:22.540 --> 07:24.670
-This is beautiful.
-It has already been sold.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.240
This too.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.110
So they have all been sold.

07:29.180 --> 07:31.580
-Gwang-soon, how much would this be?
-That is 30 nyang.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.120
How much is this? We will soon be rich!

07:39.890 --> 07:43.290
We will get some bindaetteok
and some sirutteok.

07:44.430 --> 07:47.060
I hear that powdered soybean is made daily

07:47.130 --> 07:48.230
due to all the injeolmi
that have to be made.

07:48.300 --> 07:51.170
Not even the throne
can get rid of one's lowly preferences.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.830
It seems that way.

07:53.270 --> 07:55.270
I hear that His Majesty

07:55.340 --> 07:57.740
looks for tidy toenails in women.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.510
He has every court maid and court lady
take their socks off.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.680
Talk about a wild fetish.
Toenails of all things?

08:04.850 --> 08:05.980
That reminds me.

08:06.550 --> 08:07.620
The Minister of Board of War

08:07.680 --> 08:10.020
sent a matchmaker
to Young Master Park Do-soo.

08:10.220 --> 08:11.690
Young Master Park Do-soo?

08:11.920 --> 08:14.890
The only son of Park Seung,
the Chief State Councilor?

08:14.960 --> 08:16.020
Yes.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.390
The family is in the search
of a daughter-in-law.

08:20.190 --> 08:22.500
But I heard he had two sons.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.030
Yes, a bastard son.

08:25.370 --> 08:26.530
Tae-seo is his name.

08:26.830 --> 08:30.000
Lord Park Seung laid hands
on one of his servants.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.970
On the same day at the same hour,
one was born in the master bedroom

08:33.039 --> 08:36.710
while one was born in a servant's quarter.

08:37.610 --> 08:40.049
That must be why
his wife passed away early

08:40.150 --> 08:42.549
from all the pent-up anger.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.750
Even the servant ran away.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.550
She left her four-year-old behind.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.860
The drama, my goodness.

08:49.260 --> 08:50.590
Goodness me.

08:50.790 --> 08:52.760
If you are finished with her,
it is my turn.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.360
Yes, madam.

09:09.310 --> 09:12.850
Young Master, Jo-yi wishes to see you
by the well tonight.

09:12.910 --> 09:14.920
Just you, on your own.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.020
Why is that?

09:16.350 --> 09:19.220
Young Master, by a well
in the middle of the night.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.890
It is perfect for a secret rendezvous.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.020
No, my lord.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.360
Oh, no!

09:36.240 --> 09:38.340
-Hello.
-You made it.

09:38.910 --> 09:39.970
Yes.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.310
Why did you want to meet here,
of all places?

09:45.110 --> 09:47.820
When I met a few noble ladies
to take their measurements earlier today,

09:50.520 --> 09:52.620
I overheard them speak of Lord Park Seung.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.100
-My lord.
-Yes.

10:05.170 --> 10:06.170
There is more.

10:11.510 --> 10:14.240
-Is that so?
-Yes, that is what I heard.

10:15.640 --> 10:18.880
Thank you. Do keep me informed
if you hear anything else.

10:19.380 --> 10:21.020
Sure thing, I will.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.850
I am busy, so I must get going.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.950
What? Wait, but...

10:32.530 --> 10:34.100
I suppose she is very busy.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.440
[Jo-yi wishes to see you]

10:42.140 --> 10:45.740
by the silver grass field today.
Just you, on your own.

10:46.670 --> 10:47.740
Silver grass...

10:48.310 --> 10:50.010
-The silver grass field?
-Gosh.

10:50.510 --> 10:52.480
That is where ghosts appear to haunt you.

10:56.880 --> 11:00.890
Goodness.
Why must we meet at a place like this?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.570
My lord.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.710
My lord.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.140
My lord.

11:24.180 --> 11:25.250
My lord.

11:31.420 --> 11:32.820
-My lord.
-Yes.

11:32.890 --> 11:35.020
Today, I heard some gossip
about Park Do-soo.

11:35.660 --> 11:38.460
Oh, okay.

11:45.570 --> 11:46.800
Is that so?

11:47.070 --> 11:49.770
Yes, that is what I heard. Goodbye, then.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.570
What? Wait, but...

11:54.380 --> 11:55.380
My gosh.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.390
She even does stuff like that now?

12:08.420 --> 12:11.890
Today, she wishes to see you
at the barn by the mill.

12:12.890 --> 12:15.400
The barn? That is where...

12:21.500 --> 12:22.570
Yes.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.140
-My lord.
-Oh, hello.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.950
-Tonight, I must truly...
-My lord.

12:34.580 --> 12:36.680
I heard some gossip about Park Tae-seo.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.220
Park Tae-seo?

12:51.070 --> 12:52.130
Is that so?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.240
Yes, that is what I heard.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.270
Also...

13:14.520 --> 13:17.390
Gosh! My goodness.

13:19.760 --> 13:23.060
No matter how busy you are,

13:23.730 --> 13:26.100
you must make sure
that you are always tidily dressed.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.770
Right, yes.

13:30.870 --> 13:34.610
But then again,
even if you were to wear a straw mat,

13:35.480 --> 13:36.940
you would still look good.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.150
I must go. I have a backlog of orders.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.550
What? But... Wait!

13:43.620 --> 13:44.850
My gosh, I am so busy.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.290
She is very busy, yet again.

14:03.170 --> 14:04.710
[Park Tae-seo is nowhere to be seen.]

14:09.380 --> 14:11.280
This is aconite.

14:11.610 --> 14:13.180
Many know it as an herb, but--

14:13.250 --> 14:14.620
It is also poisonous.

14:14.680 --> 14:18.150
Park Tae-seo,
the illegitimate son of Park Seung,

14:18.520 --> 14:21.120
cultivated large batches of this herb.

14:22.990 --> 14:25.730
Are you saying that the father and son

14:25.790 --> 14:28.360
are involved in the Crown Prince's death?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.400
That is not something
you should say lightly.

14:34.470 --> 14:37.340
Chief State Councilor Park Seung
was the one who installed

14:37.770 --> 14:39.310
the temporary Medicines Department.

14:40.470 --> 14:41.880
A new Medicines Department was installed

14:41.940 --> 14:43.310
and a new abscess specialist
was appointed.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.250
[Aconite, Aconite Plant]

14:46.910 --> 14:50.050
There was a sudden spike
in the prescribing of aconite.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.390
You cannot expect
this to be a coincidence.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.020
I am sure of it.

14:57.460 --> 14:58.560
That day,

14:59.590 --> 15:01.030
the abscess specialist I saw

15:02.230 --> 15:04.130
was in no way an actual physician.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.130
There must have been

15:07.030 --> 15:09.040
another abscess specialist.

15:09.870 --> 15:11.670
Before the interrogation begins,

15:11.770 --> 15:15.440
I will return with evidence
regarding the abscess specialist.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.380
Please put your trust in me.

15:18.910 --> 15:19.950
[Gwanghwamun]

15:32.290 --> 15:33.830
Did you look into it?

15:33.990 --> 15:36.830
I am truly sorry to report

15:36.900 --> 15:38.670
that I could not find any records

15:39.230 --> 15:41.100
on the fake physician you saw that day.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.970
But I did manage to find some information
on the real abscess specialist

15:45.040 --> 15:46.470
who disappeared.

15:48.210 --> 15:50.110
Born in Gyeongsang Province
in the Year of the Horse,

15:50.480 --> 15:51.950
he was an incredibly skilled physician,

15:52.010 --> 15:54.150
so the Crown Prince
trusted him a great deal.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.850
Before the Crown Prince passed away,

15:57.950 --> 16:00.320
he was suddenly dismissed
and vanished from the Palace.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.830
And it seems
that he was a compulsive note-taker.

16:13.530 --> 16:16.970
Then he must have left notes
on the Crown Prince as well.

16:17.740 --> 16:18.770
Yes. He must have.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.510
According to those who saw him
right before his disappearance,

16:23.340 --> 16:25.480
[he acted strangely
and kept having delusions.]

16:25.610 --> 16:27.310
[Then one day,
he left to do a cleansing ritual]

16:27.380 --> 16:30.150
[at Jinin Temple in Mount Samgak.]

16:32.890 --> 16:35.320
[Jinin Temple]

16:41.500 --> 16:43.400
[Buddha]

16:47.400 --> 16:51.470
Then do you think
that the abscess specialist is alive?

16:52.610 --> 16:53.810
Yes, I believe so.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.510
Then we must find him.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.510
Before the investigation begins,

17:00.980 --> 17:02.350
we must find him no matter what.

17:02.420 --> 17:03.680
He holds the key to the solution.

17:11.660 --> 17:12.760
[Buddha]

17:46.790 --> 17:47.830
Giddyap!

17:51.200 --> 17:53.770
I must find him before it's too late.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.540
Giddyap!

18:08.980 --> 18:10.150
Your Majesty.

18:13.350 --> 18:14.560
Your Majesty!

18:17.120 --> 18:20.790
Why is it so hard to play
in peace? Darn it.

18:20.890 --> 18:22.730
My apologies, Your Majesty.

18:23.030 --> 18:25.330
But Lord Park Seung

18:25.430 --> 18:27.900
keeps spouting nonsense behind bars.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.770
Well, that is...

18:56.060 --> 18:57.330
Your Majesty.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.400
What do you mean by the real
abscess specialist is still alive?

19:01.900 --> 19:03.840
You would probably know better...

19:06.240 --> 19:08.980
as to what that means than I do.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.350
How dare you

19:13.580 --> 19:15.520
try to fool me.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.380
I simply...

19:19.050 --> 19:23.690
let Your Majesty know what I only knew.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.230
I was afraid false rumors that the prince

19:28.300 --> 19:30.800
was poisoned would spread.

19:32.170 --> 19:35.600
And that is, by his father.

19:44.310 --> 19:47.920
So you will need me.

19:49.450 --> 19:52.220
Need me to erase
the false rumor that the king,

19:52.290 --> 19:54.590
jealous of the prince who returned home

19:55.460 --> 19:57.520
after suffering
from a foreign country miles away,

19:58.090 --> 20:00.090
poisoned his son.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.000
If you release me,

20:05.600 --> 20:08.670
I will secure your throne again

20:09.440 --> 20:12.070
like I did last time.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.570
Gosh.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.540
How do I...

20:51.580 --> 20:53.450
Darn it.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.380
Will this work?

20:55.680 --> 20:56.720
It hurts!

20:58.090 --> 20:59.390
Goodness.

21:01.190 --> 21:04.290
Darn it. They sure did
a good job of building it sturdy.

21:04.390 --> 21:07.460
They surely used all the tax
from the people to build this.

21:07.590 --> 21:10.560
I embezzled that much grain tax,
but it did not affect

21:10.630 --> 21:13.370
this country's management one bit.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.440
Hey, why are you so calm?

21:19.510 --> 21:20.840
Are you undergoing spiritual training?

21:24.540 --> 21:25.750
You jerk.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.550
How can you fall asleep in this situation?

21:28.820 --> 21:31.720
Tae-seo might make his way down
from the mountains,

21:31.790 --> 21:34.090
but what if he gets arrested as well?

21:36.320 --> 21:37.820
[Go ahead with Mal-jong first.]

21:38.260 --> 21:40.690
The moment you arrive in Ganghwa Island,
hide together with Han-ki.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.260
As Mal-jong said,
even Gokdu might be dangerous.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.070
Please.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.540
What are you saying?
Are you not coming with us?

21:49.170 --> 21:52.240
Go first. I have someone to meet.

21:52.940 --> 21:53.970
Who?

21:55.140 --> 21:56.240
The king.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.480
How on earth can you sleep
right now, jerk? You...

21:59.550 --> 22:00.950
You scared me!

22:01.010 --> 22:02.580
Do not open your eyes so suddenly.

22:02.650 --> 22:04.120
You almost scared me to death.

22:04.180 --> 22:06.850
The way to see the king's face up close.

22:07.690 --> 22:09.720
-What?
-This is what...

22:11.460 --> 22:12.560
Tae-seo meant.

22:12.930 --> 22:14.830
What are you talking about?

22:16.300 --> 22:19.370
What in the world did Tae-seo tell you?

22:26.470 --> 22:28.040
No way.

22:29.940 --> 22:33.210
Are you saying
he will let himself get arrested?

22:37.120 --> 22:38.320
Darn.

22:39.650 --> 22:42.120
So he thought
of meeting the king from jail?

22:44.420 --> 22:45.460
Crazy jerk.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.010
I love the sound of money.

22:58.070 --> 23:01.270
[Jo-yi, I am going to go
to the night market with Gwang-soon.]

23:01.340 --> 23:03.910
-Okay!
[-I am taking Bi-ryeong with me!]

23:04.180 --> 23:06.750
Goodness, Bi-ryeong is on fire.

23:08.020 --> 23:11.820
I wonder who made all these beauties.

23:13.850 --> 23:17.020
I have got lots of both money and orders.

23:17.890 --> 23:19.730
These...

23:20.960 --> 23:23.600
I will set them here.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.070
And this...

23:28.670 --> 23:31.570
will go in my bag as a nest egg.

23:34.270 --> 23:35.310
What?

23:44.620 --> 23:47.850
It would have been great
if you were here with us, Bo-ri.

23:54.130 --> 23:55.230
Jo-yi!

23:56.200 --> 23:57.260
Hey.

24:00.930 --> 24:02.470
What brings you here?

24:03.970 --> 24:05.340
Comb my hair for me.

24:08.410 --> 24:09.480
Sit.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.190
You always used that broken comb,
but this is new.

24:21.350 --> 24:24.060
A lady gave it to me earlier.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.760
That reminds me, she was looking for you.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.800
-Me?
-Yes.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.470
She asked where your house was,
so I told her. Did she not drop by?

24:33.300 --> 24:34.400
No.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.840
No one came by today.

24:37.570 --> 24:38.910
That is strange.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.840
She said she was from
Yeowool Valley, your hometown.

24:46.010 --> 24:47.910
-Yeowool Valley?
-Yes.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.520
She told me you were villagers.

24:52.590 --> 24:54.390
Villagers, I see.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.690
-Did she only mention that?
-Yes.

24:57.890 --> 24:59.530
Yes, villagers.

25:00.260 --> 25:01.630
Villager.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.600
Who can it be?

25:05.500 --> 25:06.830
It hurts, Jo-yi.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.200
My bad.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.100
So do not move.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.370
It will hurt if you do.

25:15.580 --> 25:18.980
You feel like my mom,
combing my hair like this.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.180
Though I would not know that feeling

25:21.280 --> 25:23.650
since I do not have a mom.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.590
You can have that comb.

25:30.620 --> 25:32.630
It was for you,
so why would you give it to me?

25:32.890 --> 25:35.430
You are going to comb my hair anyway,
so what is the big deal?

25:35.760 --> 25:36.960
Just have it.

25:37.130 --> 25:38.570
So that I can drive you hard.

25:40.600 --> 25:44.070
Fine. Drive me hard as much as you want

25:44.140 --> 25:46.540
-since I will comb your hair every day.
-Okay!

26:04.520 --> 26:06.260
[Gunpowder Sales]

26:10.130 --> 26:11.200
[My lord!]

26:13.130 --> 26:14.600
Get back safely.

26:16.570 --> 26:18.140
What is that ledger?

26:20.240 --> 26:22.040
It seems like records of gunpowder sales.

26:22.840 --> 26:23.940

are they not?

26:38.460 --> 26:41.190

and trade at Ganghwa Island.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.970
Give this ledger to Yuk-chil.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.800

when I make a report.

26:55.910 --> 26:58.250
[-Are you home?]
-Yes!

26:58.580 --> 27:00.280
[I brought the house contract.]

27:06.950 --> 27:08.020
Gosh.

27:10.260 --> 27:13.260
Oriental melons must be out of season.
I could not find much.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.530
But I was still able to buy some.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.730
I am such an obedient kid.

27:24.370 --> 27:26.110
Here, the contract.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.240
Right, thanks.

27:30.540 --> 27:32.180
You should at least take a look at it.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.480
No need, I am sure you did a great job.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.690
Then why the long face?

27:40.150 --> 27:42.160
-Are you tired?
-What?

27:44.290 --> 27:46.130
Yes, I am.

27:54.100 --> 27:57.070
As a lawyer, you must have
extensive knowledge of the law.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.410
Right. I probably know
more than you at least.

28:00.370 --> 28:03.440
When an interrogation
by a King's order takes place,

28:03.510 --> 28:05.850
all the evidence must be present

28:06.250 --> 28:07.950
for the offender to be punished, right?

28:08.450 --> 28:09.420
Yes.

28:09.650 --> 28:11.050
Confessions will do,

28:11.120 --> 28:13.220
but having evidence
makes it an easier process.

28:13.950 --> 28:18.290
What will happen if a name appears

28:18.590 --> 28:20.290
on one of the pieces of evidence?

28:23.100 --> 28:24.100
What?

28:25.570 --> 28:28.270
I do not mean the name of anyone guilty.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.640
This person did nothing wrong,

28:31.770 --> 28:35.280
but that person's name is on the evidence.

28:36.010 --> 28:38.410
Could that lead to
the person being punished?

28:39.850 --> 28:42.080
This person must be involved in some way.

28:42.150 --> 28:43.420
A punishment may be too soon,

28:43.720 --> 28:46.950
but the person will be arrested,
tortured, and interrogated.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.310
Why on earth is this in your possession?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.340
I do not know.

30:19.410 --> 30:20.750
What do I do?

30:20.950 --> 30:22.780
What if this endangers my mother?

30:25.050 --> 30:28.690
The thought of turning this over to
the Office of Special Justice scares me.

30:29.290 --> 30:32.460
So all of this happened
because you became affiliated

30:32.530 --> 30:34.160
with a secret royal inspector.

30:34.430 --> 30:35.800
A secret royal inspector!

30:37.800 --> 30:39.800
I should have handed this over sooner,

30:41.130 --> 30:42.970
but I broke my promise.

30:43.640 --> 30:46.040
I know that this is wrong, but--

30:46.110 --> 30:49.080
Of course. I understand
your dilemma as her daughter.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.810
However, you will only look guilty too.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.350
You are hiding key evidence.

30:56.650 --> 30:59.320
It will cause trouble
for Inspector Ra as well.

31:01.420 --> 31:03.790
You said the inspector
already read its contents.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.130
Then he might have already

31:06.190 --> 31:08.900
interrogated those involved
and obtained a confession.

31:10.030 --> 31:14.770
Are you saying that my mother
could soon be arrested?

31:14.900 --> 31:17.170
But if she is innocent
like you say she is,

31:17.240 --> 31:18.300
she will be free to leave.

31:20.610 --> 31:23.040
You said that the inspector
acts truthfully and in fairness.

31:23.540 --> 31:25.980
Would he not help her once her innocence

31:26.050 --> 31:27.350
has been proven?

31:30.020 --> 31:34.720
[But what if my mother
is guilty in some way?]

31:36.190 --> 31:37.260
We should go.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.040
Come on, Jo-yi.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.550
No, I cannot possibly do this.

32:03.250 --> 32:05.920
This is why the law is brutal
and ironic in some ways.

32:07.090 --> 32:09.160
We are to honor the three bonds
and five relationships in Confucianism,

32:09.460 --> 32:11.490
but the law sometimes forces us
to violate moral laws.

32:21.100 --> 32:24.570
Then take your time tonight
and think about your options.

32:24.770 --> 32:27.170
You can call me
when you come to a decision.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.920
And have some of this.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.380
You will need the energy.

32:39.550 --> 32:40.550
I will get going then.

33:37.510 --> 33:38.650
My apologies.

33:39.410 --> 33:41.080
Due to all the checkpoints,

33:41.150 --> 33:42.780
I had to take the long route.

Everybody runs late once in a while.

33:45.920 --> 33:47.120
Did you find her?

33:50.990 --> 33:52.560
A friend of hers

33:52.630 --> 33:54.760
helped her find a place to stay.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.670
-A friend?
-Yes, a male friend though.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.830
From what I gathered,

34:00.900 --> 34:02.800
he works as a lawyer in Hanyang.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.470
His name is Choi Seung-ryul.
Does it ring a bell?

34:06.840 --> 34:09.840
Seung-ryul? They are childhood friends.

34:09.909 --> 34:11.210
He is someone we can trust.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.679
Is that so?

34:13.810 --> 34:16.679
Thank you.
The recon must not have been easy.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.350
Because of her good-for-nothing mother,

You expect me to eat cold food?

52:29.010 --> 52:33.110
The thing is,
I heard my mother was back home now.

52:33.380 --> 52:35.810
I would like to go there
and see her briefly.

52:35.880 --> 52:37.380
What?

52:37.450 --> 52:40.450
She was dragged to Qing.
That is nothing to brag about!

52:40.520 --> 52:42.750
If anything, she should lie low
and not be seen.

52:42.820 --> 52:45.620
Do you want all the neighbors to find out?

52:45.690 --> 52:50.200
"Everyone! I was dragged to Qing,
but now I am back!"

52:50.260 --> 52:51.330
Is that it?

52:51.400 --> 52:53.330
My mother is not a criminal.

52:53.670 --> 52:56.500
I am the one who should be ashamed
of not being able to protect my mother.

52:56.570 --> 52:58.640
Not my mother, for being dragged off.

52:59.540 --> 53:02.170
You have no shame, just like your mother.

53:03.310 --> 53:07.310
Anyway, I do not want to eat right now.

53:07.380 --> 53:08.850
Bring me my lunch later!

53:10.220 --> 53:13.990
I already set the table for you,
so eat when you are hungry!

53:14.050 --> 53:17.190
What? What did you say?

53:17.260 --> 53:19.020
Goodness!

53:19.090 --> 53:21.230
Chu-han!

53:21.290 --> 53:24.460
That wench is trying
to starve her mother-in-law to death!

53:24.900 --> 53:27.930
Chu-han!

53:33.540 --> 53:35.040
That was so mean of her.

53:36.010 --> 53:37.780
How can she say that?

53:40.980 --> 53:43.350
I put up with all her obnoxiousness,

53:43.520 --> 53:45.350
but I cannot if she talks bad
about my mother.

53:46.650 --> 53:48.620
She did not go to Qing
out of her own will.

53:49.390 --> 53:51.990
It is the country's fault we lost the war,
not the women's.

53:52.620 --> 53:55.030
Why do women get blamed for everything?

55:14.910 --> 55:17.910
Look, our lord finally caught him.

55:17.980 --> 55:20.110
Yuk-chil, it is that guy.

55:20.180 --> 55:21.550
You jerk!

55:21.610 --> 55:24.780
Do you know we held a funeral
for our lord because of you?

55:24.880 --> 55:28.120
-You unbelievable jerk!
-Now, now. He is dead meat anyway.

55:32.260 --> 55:35.190
That man over there is our lord.

55:35.330 --> 55:36.900
The Junior Sixth Counselor!

55:36.960 --> 55:40.470
Ra from Naju, Lord Ra Yi-eon!

55:40.530 --> 55:44.100
That man there is our lord!

55:52.880 --> 55:55.810
[Gunpowder Sales]

56:02.590 --> 56:05.560
[Gunpowder Sales]

56:04.660 --> 56:09.260
[Everyone! Our lord is Lord Ra Yi-eon!]

56:09.630 --> 56:12.360
[He has arrested the greatest criminal!]

56:12.430 --> 56:15.430
[Everyone! Our lord arrested
the greatest criminal!]

56:17.470 --> 56:19.370
So it is him.

56:19.440 --> 56:21.610
-Gosh, from stealing to murder.
-Right.

56:21.670 --> 56:24.840
I have never met anyone
so evil in my life.

56:24.910 --> 56:27.850
No wonder the king ordered his arrest.

56:26.340 --> 56:27.850
[Gunpowder Sales]

56:27.910 --> 56:30.050
Guys like him should be beheaded.

56:30.120 --> 56:33.120
Of course. Off with their head!

56:33.180 --> 56:35.020
You wicked jerk!

56:35.090 --> 56:37.320
Stop it.

56:37.390 --> 56:39.460
All criminals should be burned.

56:39.520 --> 56:43.060
What evil things has he done to earn
the title of the greatest criminal?

56:46.970 --> 56:51.540
[Gunpowder Sales]

57:00.310 --> 57:02.080
[There was a ledger
containing gunpowder sales.]

57:10.260 --> 57:11.560
[Gunpowder Sales]

57:14.260 --> 57:17.430
[Gunpowder Sales]

57:19.630 --> 57:23.070
[Gunpowder Sales]

57:38.580 --> 57:42.120
[Gunpowder Sales]

57:45.660 --> 57:47.630
[The scenes with animals
were safely filmed.]

57:59.040 --> 57:59.940
[We thank Lee Jun-hyuk, Jo Kwan-woo,
and Cha Hak-yeon]

58:00.000 --> 58:00.810
[for their special appearance.]

58:01.210 --> 58:03.980
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

58:04.610 --> 58:06.210
[I made the wrong choice.]

58:06.540 --> 58:08.810
[Gokdu Guild is being brought down!]

58:08.910 --> 58:10.980
[I could not locate the ledger
with your name in it.]

58:11.150 --> 58:13.750
[This would not have happened
without help from within the palace.]

58:13.820 --> 58:17.090
[My lord, be patient
for we will soon be with you.]

58:17.220 --> 58:19.860
[There must be something
in the Pharmacy Journal.]

58:20.060 --> 58:22.830
[Did I run? Or did I hide?]

58:23.130 --> 58:25.000
I am right here before your eyes.

58:25.200 --> 58:28.630
[I do not care what the truth is.
All I want to know is the right answer.]

58:28.900 --> 58:31.600
[Tie the offender to the rack
and interrogate him.]
