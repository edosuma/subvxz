WEBVTT

00:19.250 --> 00:23.542
Your ticket, Monsieur. - Good evening, ma'am.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.917
-Eva! I'm so glad to see you!

00:48.625 --> 00:50.458
Eva...

00:50.542 --> 00:54.583
I was thinking that you gone back to America.

00:54.667 --> 00:59.333
-Servier've been looking for you. -I was here.

00:59.417 --> 01:05.875
At first I thought you were a schemer. Calculating.

01:05.958 --> 01:10.292
That you were drawn to Korben and power.

01:10.375 --> 01:14.625
-Forgive me. -Do not apologize.

01:14.708 --> 01:20.375
I would have had a hidden strategy, a plan of life.

01:20.458 --> 01:26.500
I know I seem harsh. You do not like me at once.

01:26.583 --> 01:30.958
It takes time for me to feel things.

01:31.042 --> 01:37.000
But if you looked into my head, you would see that I have emotions

01:37.083 --> 01:40.250
And I want to be loved.

01:42.625 --> 01:45.625
Do you remember that party?

01:45.708 --> 01:49.250
Of course I remember.

01:49.333 --> 01:52.208
When was it again?

01:52.292 --> 01:56.083
That was before all this terrible.

01:56.167 --> 01:59.083
Now talk about "förkrigstid" -

01:59.167 --> 02:04.125
But you never know that you live before the war.

02:31.333 --> 02:36.500
Do you think they see the stars? -Who?

02:36.583 --> 02:40.833
-The home. It is the day where now.

02:40.917 --> 02:45.083
Why is it no stars of the day?

02:45.167 --> 02:51.042
Sometimes you have to turn off the lights to see.

02:52.208 --> 02:55.833
A few years earlier

02:57.417 --> 03:01.417
Like when you close your eyes to see their dreams?

03:01.500 --> 03:04.583
Yeah, about that.

03:04.667 --> 03:08.250
Laura, when are we going home?

03:08.333 --> 03:12.292
Soon. Come closer.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.042
In the morning we wake up in Paris.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.833
Paris.

04:27.708 --> 04:31.375
Welcome to the L'oiseau de paradis.

04:31.458 --> 04:34.458
Efter Bucharest, Warsaw, Prague ...

04:34.542 --> 04:37.917
Breathe. Breathe.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
-I freezes so. You're just scared.

04:43.125 --> 04:47.917
America's most celebrated media.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.750
In the evening, you will not witness a performance.

04:53.833 --> 04:57.958
You will experience something.

04:58.042 --> 05:03.750
In order not to disturb their concentration I pray replaced

05:03.833 --> 05:08.000
-to accept them without applause.

05:09.917 --> 05:12.708
Here we go.

05:12.792 --> 05:16.833
Welcome systrarna Barlow!

05:30.375 --> 05:36.167
I would first like to apologize.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.833
I do not want to disappoint anyone.

05:38.917 --> 05:44.625
We will not show you anything you did not already know.

05:44.708 --> 05:50.792
We will reveal to you what you have lost.

05:55.167 --> 05:58.083
Your dead relatives.

05:59.292 --> 06:03.292
When coming from such a young nation like the US

06:08.458 --> 06:13.417
If you think about it, then populated the land that we are loading

06:13.500 --> 06:20.792
-of ten or even a hundred times more dead than alive.

06:21.833 --> 06:24.667
What do they say?

06:25.792 --> 06:28.917
We can talk to them.

06:34.458 --> 06:37.292
Is there anyone here ...

06:37.375 --> 06:41.417
... who is willing to answer me? Quite frankly?

06:41.500 --> 06:44.375
Is it a spirit?

06:45.417 --> 06:48.333
Is there a wounded spirit?

06:50.667 --> 06:53.292
And you?

06:54.333 --> 06:56.583
Are you ready?

06:56.667 --> 07:01.125
Are you ready to hear it?

07:01.208 --> 07:05.125
Are you ready to hear the truth ...

07:05.208 --> 07:08.125
... the two women?

07:08.208 --> 07:10.583
Quite frankly?

07:28.333 --> 07:35.417
-No. I think it's scary. Come, Mme. Do not be afraid.

07:35.500 --> 07:39.458
Expect nothing, hope for everything.

07:42.125 --> 07:48.167
Listen to my sister's breath. Concentrate on her breath.

08:13.917 --> 08:16.333
It will.

08:25.542 --> 08:28.042
I'm here.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.625
Mother?

08:37.167 --> 08:41.375
-Yes. -Mother? Mother?

08:41.458 --> 08:43.417
And.

08:44.917 --> 08:49.250
Is it you, my child? -What's his name?

08:53.500 --> 08:57.875
Tell Juncker, if you want a private seance.

08:59.708 --> 09:06.333
What fun that you liked it. We also offer private sessions.

09:07.667 --> 09:12.542
-So we meet at last! -Amazing display.

09:12.625 --> 09:18.292
-Bjud her over to England. I have full of ideas.

09:32.958 --> 09:36.917
-You have to meet my sister. -Where is she?

09:37.000 --> 09:40.500
Sit here. I'll get her.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.292
A maximum of two glasses, we said. We're not done yet.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.708
I want you to meet someone. But the birds, then?

09:55.792 --> 09:58.292
They are still there.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.417
And private seances?

10:11.125 --> 10:16.208
-Is that all? It's hard times for everyone.

10:16.292 --> 10:18.958
Kitching and London, then?

10:19.042 --> 10:23.500
He quickly disappeared. We had no time to talk business.

10:23.583 --> 10:27.583
-Gick he? -Not the first time.

10:30.167 --> 10:33.083
I am terribly sorry.

10:34.542 --> 10:37.458
Vincent, close?

10:38.500 --> 10:41.667
-What is it? -Nothing. Did you sleep.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.958
Come in.

11:12.708 --> 11:16.458
How nice that you came. I've been waiting.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.875
Sorry about yesterday. I was rude.

11:22.958 --> 11:27.167
-Champagne? -No thanks. Not her either.

11:27.250 --> 11:32.250
-What beautiful home you have. I love knickknacks.

11:32.333 --> 11:38.417
I collect things in my travels - and even when I'm not traveling.

11:38.500 --> 11:42.667
But I care not for them. -You speak good English.

11:42.750 --> 11:47.333
-That was nice said. -You have an accent.

11:47.417 --> 11:53.667
-Additionally the French. -You are right. I was not born here.

12:03.458 --> 12:07.542
We can start whenever you want. We are done.

12:19.458 --> 12:23.292
We need another chair. -Why?

12:23.375 --> 12:29.792
When we evoke a spirit is like inviting a guest.

12:29.875 --> 12:34.917
I understand. - Martin, we would need to chair.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.583
Certainly, monsieur.

12:50.167 --> 12:54.792
We begin to take each other's hands.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.625
Close your eyes.

12:58.917 --> 13:04.375
Are you willing to believe, André? Are you willing to let us in?

13:04.458 --> 13:06.000
And.

13:06.083 --> 13:11.000
Place all doubt in a red circle. Visualize the circle.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.542
Listen to my sister's breath.

13:13.625 --> 13:18.500
The circle becomes smaller and disappear.

13:21.875 --> 13:24.250
It will.

13:32.917 --> 13:35.958
What do you see?

13:36.042 --> 13:38.125
Nothing.

13:38.208 --> 13:41.917
I hear footsteps.

14:15.708 --> 14:18.583
André?

14:21.542 --> 14:23.583
André!

14:35.167 --> 14:37.708
André?

14:41.292 --> 14:44.417
Is everything okay?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.583
And.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.958
How do you do it?

15:09.250 --> 15:10.958
Tack.

15:12.542 --> 15:15.333
Good evening.

15:48.958 --> 15:52.583
I hear footsteps.

16:44.875 --> 16:51.417
We do not go away until we got to know which direction you are going to take!

16:53.708 --> 16:57.875
Gentlemen! We will be happy to answer your questions.

16:57.958 --> 17:03.708
But you can not blame us the path we have chosen to go the last errands

17:03.792 --> 17:06.917
-and at the same time accusing us of having concealed it.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.250
You have not concealed anything. You made the decisions against our will.

17:12.333 --> 17:15.458
The board should probably resign.

17:17.042 --> 17:21.833
If there is a war going all fine ideas up in smoke!

17:21.917 --> 17:24.708
Thank you, gentlemen.

17:24.792 --> 17:28.625
I hear what you say. Now let me answer.

17:28.708 --> 17:34.542
You forget one important factor: the economic crisis.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.750
That's too easy!

17:36.833 --> 17:41.042
We have not asked for our dividend replaced by your castles in the air!

17:41.125 --> 17:44.167
Forgive me, but that's a lie.

17:44.250 --> 17:49.250
You will receive no dividend, as my predecessors have explained to you.

17:49.333 --> 17:54.417
It's not about profit sharing, but about equity as you get back.

17:54.500 --> 17:59.917
-You conjure with words! -Let us turn to the essential.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.125
I am the first to regret that the French film fallen so far behind.

18:06.208 --> 18:13.667
While Americans continue to evolve, we are asleep!

18:13.750 --> 18:21.083
Will you remain in slumber? Is that the solution you propose?

18:21.167 --> 18:25.958
Gentlemen, I have good news.

18:26.042 --> 18:28.958
There will be no dividend payments

18:44.250 --> 18:49.208
Excuse me, I must go. - I'll call later, enter.

18:49.292 --> 18:55.250
M. Korben! Sorry, I did not mean to bust you in the past.

18:55.333 --> 18:58.958
But the company can not be controlled by a person's dreams.

18:59.042 --> 19:03.458
I understand, Monsieur Chaumette. See you later.

19:10.667 --> 19:13.792
-What is going on? -A trailer has overturned.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.292
When are we going to London?

19:37.500 --> 19:43.250
I thought we could stay here for a while. Give us down.

19:43.333 --> 19:48.458
It would be not so foolish? But we do not have any seances here.

19:48.542 --> 19:54.750
Just because. We should ... do something else.

19:54.833 --> 19:57.792
-Like what? -I do not know.

19:57.875 --> 20:03.750
There is so much to do, so much to experience.

20:20.500 --> 20:26.458
If only I knew you would come. I'll go and get dressed.

20:26.542 --> 20:30.458
No, stop, please.

20:30.542 --> 20:33.000
Sit down.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.500
It happened yesterday gave me an idea.

20:39.583 --> 20:45.792
I want to do something completely new. The man who showed up ...

20:45.875 --> 20:48.500
Who was it?

20:48.583 --> 20:52.833
My brother. He felt so real.

20:52.917 --> 20:57.792
I would like to film it. -Film...?

20:59.417 --> 21:05.000
I do not know. We would have to set up our Englandsturné

21:05.083 --> 21:09.500
And we have several private sessions scheduled.

21:11.917 --> 21:15.083
-It will cost. -Obvious.

21:15.167 --> 21:18.542
Séances and performances are one thing.

21:18.625 --> 21:25.708
But I can make you famous in a way that only film permits.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.708
It is my cup of tea. My profession.

21:30.792 --> 21:33.958
Should we make a film?

21:34.042 --> 21:37.250
-Here. It was not needed.

21:37.333 --> 21:40.458
-Kate! Say thank you. -Thanks.

21:48.667 --> 21:54.583
Brilliant. This is amazing. We sign a contract.

21:54.667 --> 22:00.042
I love contract. You can move in with me.

22:01.375 --> 22:03.542
Laura?

22:03.625 --> 22:06.875
Excuse me a moment.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.958
-What is it? -Nothing.

22:10.042 --> 22:12.375
What?

22:12.458 --> 22:17.125
We have never stayed at customers before. Why should we stay with him?

22:17.208 --> 22:20.125
It's much better than this.

22:20.208 --> 22:26.583
You know how rich people are. They get their whim, then ledsnar quickly.

22:26.667 --> 22:29.875
We enjoy while it lasts.

22:30.917 --> 22:35.000
We need this. He is our chance.

22:35.083 --> 22:39.208
I'm not made of money. We could save ...

22:39.292 --> 22:42.500
... and maybe go home.

23:23.917 --> 23:27.083
I have never seen so many at once!

23:29.583 --> 23:32.417
It smells good.

23:32.500 --> 23:36.875
Is that not a bit much? -Otherwise seen there.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.125
It's not like everyday.

23:39.208 --> 23:44.583
It is too much for everyday is not visible on the screen.

23:44.667 --> 23:49.958
-Hello everybody. -Good day, Monsieur Servier.

23:50.042 --> 23:53.125
God day.

23:53.208 --> 23:58.917
Are gentle and Dimitri. - I did not know you were so beautiful.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.125
Beautiful. - Not too much. Rouged, not trowelled!

24:05.208 --> 24:08.917
Speed ​​up a little. A little more smoke.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.208
That's not necessary. We have already gone through everything.

24:13.292 --> 24:16.792
-Is camera ready? Excuse me, glasses ...

24:16.875 --> 24:21.792
It becomes reflexes. I feel better with them on.

24:21.875 --> 24:24.375
Then we get by anyway.

24:24.458 --> 24:28.083
-Of course of shooting. -Systrarna Barlow. First take.

24:28.167 --> 24:32.667
You can close your eyes. It's fine. Just concentrate.

24:32.750 --> 24:35.708
-What is going on? Too much light.

24:35.792 --> 24:41.042
If anything should get caught on the tape, we must have light.

24:41.125 --> 24:45.792
Can not we put out a just? They have to get used to ...

24:45.875 --> 24:49.958
I know, but only until they find their feet.

24:50.042 --> 24:56.417
-Emiliano, blanking a headlamp. -When will the light level is too low.

24:59.750 --> 25:04.625
We need to control performance, just like during a seance.

25:04.708 --> 25:09.667
Who is directing, then? -I. I have seen how Servier do.

25:09.750 --> 25:16.125
How are you supposed to talk to the team? -In French. I learn quickly.

25:16.208 --> 25:21.708
It is a profession. It looks easy, but it is hard work behind it.

25:21.792 --> 25:24.583
I'm not afraid of hard work.

25:24.667 --> 25:28.542
I notice that you're scared. -I am not afraid.

25:28.625 --> 25:31.750
Go back now. Do it for my sake.

25:31.833 --> 25:34.042
Take your seats!

25:45.125 --> 25:48.042
I know what you will say.

25:48.125 --> 25:55.125
Forgive me, André, but what did you expect? That something would turn up? A ghost?

25:55.208 --> 25:58.625
When you say it like that, it seems ridiculous.

25:58.708 --> 26:03.708
I do not think we understand each other. We can recreate what you saw

26:03.792 --> 26:10.625
-or what the girl looks while we film her. So what's the problem?

26:10.708 --> 26:15.250
I do not know what I'm after, but we lack ambition.

26:15.333 --> 26:18.583
They are fascinating. Do not you think?

26:19.875 --> 26:25.333
My opinion? The little girl is hard filmed. She is introverted and grumpy.

26:25.417 --> 26:32.042
The elderly have something, however. Attendance, emotion, personality.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.875
It's her I'm looking at.

26:34.958 --> 26:40.875
The camera is unfair. It is the youngest who has brilliance.

26:40.958 --> 26:45.792
-How do you know that? -Take a seance, to view.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.250
If I may fantasize high for a while ... Imagine that we take Laura-

26:54.333 --> 26:59.708
-and gives her the lead role in a film, as a medium, of course.

26:59.792 --> 27:04.292
She helps a young widower to make contact with her deceased husband.

27:04.375 --> 27:08.333
Suzanne note well? This is great!

27:08.417 --> 27:14.000
We take her as she is just, with all the knowledge she already carries.

27:14.083 --> 27:19.875
We go out in the press that there is a real medium. It attracts people.

27:19.958 --> 27:23.833
What it may take to write the script? -5-6 weeks.

27:23.917 --> 27:26.000
Excellent!

27:26.083 --> 27:28.667
There we have our project.

27:29.750 --> 27:32.667
-Hi. -Laura!

27:32.750 --> 27:39.750
You are punctual. I'm not used to. Here are your marks.

27:39.833 --> 27:44.542
They take me. You will see anyway.

27:50.250 --> 27:55.500
-Provfilmning, Laura Barlow. -Strunta in the replicas.

27:55.583 --> 27:59.792
-What's your name? My name is Laura Barlow.

27:59.875 --> 28:04.792
Where are you from? Where do you from?

28:09.083 --> 28:12.167
From Rochester, New York.

28:12.250 --> 28:18.583
-Rochester? Is it a city? -Yes, north of the city of New York.

28:18.667 --> 28:22.708
It is a cheese, not a city.

28:23.750 --> 28:26.833
Well then, read some of the text.

28:28.542 --> 28:34.042
"The shared life had formed solid friendships between men."

29:20.708 --> 29:24.917
-Liqueur? No, thanks, I do not drink.

29:29.167 --> 29:31.542
No thanks.

29:37.375 --> 29:41.833
You're probably wondering if I'm weird.

29:43.417 --> 29:48.375
I will immediately answer. I'm not weird.

29:48.458 --> 29:52.958
I'm not an occultist. I do not do black mässor

29:56.083 --> 30:01.250
I am so rational it may be, even boring.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.917
Look at me, Korben.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.667
I'm here because you too have begun to ponder.

30:09.750 --> 30:13.208
You try to keep lugnet-

30:13.292 --> 30:19.875
But in your smoldering of the issues, concerns and desires.

30:19.958 --> 30:24.833
You have to explore - lots! Not content with intryck

30:24.917 --> 30:30.500
-without attack these events scientifically, until you know.

30:30.583 --> 30:34.083
I have to meet with the girls, especially the youngest.

30:34.167 --> 30:40.042
We met briefly in Warsaw, but we have never made any attempt.

30:40.125 --> 30:44.458
That was why you asked me to come?

30:44.542 --> 30:48.125
But I must warn you:

30:48.208 --> 30:51.000
It is very costly.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.375
Money is no problem.

30:55.458 --> 31:02.792
They are the only photo evidence available. -Tjugo years old. They are manipulated.

31:02.875 --> 31:09.167
There is always, but some are better than others. What is it you want?

31:09.250 --> 31:12.708
We may well look at the proposals. -Now?

31:12.792 --> 31:15.708
Yes. - Open.

31:15.792 --> 31:19.542
A draft only. It will be better then.

31:19.625 --> 31:23.500
Sorry you do not advance. Let's see.

31:24.542 --> 31:29.083
We have put in black and white negativbilder-

31:29.167 --> 31:32.958
-To get the white and blurred figures.

31:33.042 --> 31:37.292
-Impressive! -Very elegant.

31:37.375 --> 31:40.542
It is a cleverly done.

31:40.625 --> 31:44.000
-very successful. -But?

31:44.083 --> 31:47.208
I have other ambitions. -What then?

31:47.292 --> 31:51.458
-To shoot real phenomenon. But we must move forward.

31:51.542 --> 31:55.875
We do this best by capturing a vision on film.

31:55.958 --> 32:03.250
Minimum sign of spiritual presence and the film becomes a given success.

32:03.333 --> 32:07.292
Imagine! It would be the first time.

32:07.375 --> 32:11.292
Real photos of supernatural phenomena. It has not seen before.

32:11.375 --> 32:14.375
"You promised to try."

32:14.458 --> 32:17.625
"They are waiting for us. Come on. Just an hour."

32:17.708 --> 32:22.333
- "Pointing to the window." It is a stage direction.

32:22.417 --> 32:25.875
You underestimate the audience's level of maturity.

32:25.958 --> 32:29.833
-Brilliant! I had probably imagined black.

32:29.917 --> 32:35.375
She will not be at the funeral. She should be sheer, like a ghost.

32:35.458 --> 32:39.208
Do not listen to him, he is really bad mood.

32:39.292 --> 32:42.833
-He's right. -Good morning everybody!

32:42.917 --> 32:49.125
Good morning, Émile. All is well? - A little less, Georges.

32:49.208 --> 32:55.375
Fernand! Thank you that you could get.

32:55.458 --> 32:58.542
-Here we are Laura. -Pleasantly.

32:58.625 --> 33:02.167
She has not played before, so we have to help her.

33:02.250 --> 33:08.708
That's enough. All of their locations. Clement takes his place.

33:08.792 --> 33:13.917
Hurry up, everybody. - Laura, knocking hard on the door.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.500
- -Okay. I sit here.

33:18.583 --> 33:24.500
Eva will play that role. Regrets. - Is everyone ready?

33:24.583 --> 33:27.375
Right! I'll explain the background.

33:27.458 --> 33:34.500
You are therefore Clément, a young painter. You mourn your recently deceased wife.

33:34.583 --> 33:37.875
Your agent is saddened by your ending inspiration-

33:37.958 --> 33:43.208
And forces you to meet Maggie, a world-famous medium from the US.

33:43.292 --> 33:48.000
Sean were becoming overwhelming. You will regain gnistan

33:48.083 --> 33:52.292
-Then you come in contact with your deceased wife. Are you in?

33:52.375 --> 33:58.875
You will be overthrown love, but Maggie think it's the wife, you älskar

33:58.958 --> 34:02.958
-that you can never love anyone but her,

34:03.042 --> 34:07.458
-and you deceive her.

34:07.542 --> 34:15.125
Later, you will be confused. You do not know if it's Maggie, you're in love i

34:15.208 --> 34:21.125
-or if you through her got into another tragic love story.

34:21.208 --> 34:26.333
-Can I ask something? -No. Keep in uncertainty.

34:26.417 --> 34:30.833
That's really good. - Let's go. We are already behind.

34:37.625 --> 34:40.833
"Fatal revelation", shooting one.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.542
You're welcome.

34:48.292 --> 34:52.833
Clément! Where are you? I do not see you, it's so dark.

34:52.917 --> 34:55.292
A little quieter, Laura.

34:56.958 --> 34:58.917
Clement?

34:59.000 --> 35:02.333
Where are you? I can not see you.

35:02.417 --> 35:04.500
It's so dark.

35:04.583 --> 35:07.708
I do not want to go out.

35:07.792 --> 35:14.750
Are you sitting with her again? You promised you, promised to try.

35:14.833 --> 35:19.250
-They are waiting. Come on. -No. I can not keep my promise.

35:19.333 --> 35:24.208
It takes only one hour. It is close. -You do not understand.

35:24.292 --> 35:29.500
I want to see you in daylight. I want to hear you speak to the living.

35:29.583 --> 35:35.750
To go further would be to abandon her. But she sees what is happening between us.

35:35.833 --> 35:40.917
She gives us her blessing. It happens between us?

35:41.000 --> 35:44.917
Do not force me to put into words my feelings.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.125
-You talk too much. -Turn around!

35:49.208 --> 35:53.333
I'm not even half! I conceal nothing for myself.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.958
And for her? -My affection.

35:56.042 --> 36:00.125
-Snurra more. That I want to see you all the time.

36:00.208 --> 36:02.083
And talk to her. -No.

36:02.167 --> 36:04.458
Continue to spin.

36:04.542 --> 36:08.167
The fear when you will, the fear when you go.

36:08.250 --> 36:12.417
-I beg you. -My confusion ...

36:12.500 --> 36:16.167
There is nothing worse than to deceive a deceased person.

36:16.250 --> 36:21.375
I will arise, Clément. This studio is a mausoleum.

36:21.458 --> 36:25.958
- -I'm going to kiss you, Maggie.

36:26.042 --> 36:29.000
You can still stop me.

36:30.042 --> 36:33.542
You kiss me to hold her.

36:33.625 --> 36:38.167
When I kiss you, we are three. It's an orgy.

36:53.708 --> 36:55.625
Break!

36:58.250 --> 37:04.917
-Syns when I sit at the table? Yeah, it was great.

37:09.833 --> 37:13.333
We'll take it. Back to your seats!

37:38.458 --> 37:42.125
What are you worried about? It was great.

37:42.208 --> 37:49.000
I do not know. I was not there, but at the same time I was completely naked.

37:49.083 --> 37:52.542
-I was ashamed. -It does.

37:52.625 --> 37:58.417
That's why you were so beautiful. You have to give in, give up.

37:58.500 --> 38:00.875
Give up what? -To understand.

38:00.958 --> 38:05.750
To think that you need to have experienced the emotions to portray them.

38:05.833 --> 38:11.625
That's why you play, to experience some things stronger.

38:11.708 --> 38:17.042
It annoys him not to have done it, and so do the film.

38:22.958 --> 38:25.292
Do you understand?

38:25.375 --> 38:29.292
I do not know. But I'll do it.

38:29.375 --> 38:32.750
-Become not overconfident. -I am not.

38:32.833 --> 38:37.667
But it must be good. That's why I'm scared.

38:37.750 --> 38:42.417
I want everything to be good - now. I want to experience everything.

38:42.500 --> 38:46.292
Calm down. So far all goes well.

38:46.375 --> 38:51.917
Right now, this is your life: your room and a movie.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.750
By playing, you will start to feel. Do not be afraid.

38:56.833 --> 39:02.292
Do you dream? Do you often have dreams that you remember?

39:03.625 --> 39:06.833
I do not know.

39:06.917 --> 39:11.375
Look in the mirror. We'll try something.

39:13.417 --> 39:17.917
Tilt your head back, slowly.

39:20.833 --> 39:23.208
A little more.

39:25.875 --> 39:29.083
A little more.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.167
A little more...

39:34.292 --> 39:38.208
There you go. Good.

39:38.292 --> 39:44.083
Just then, Laura. Let go and stop doubting.

39:44.167 --> 39:46.208
Go away.

40:23.042 --> 40:25.250
Hurry up!

40:56.542 --> 40:58.833
We're coming!

41:02.125 --> 41:05.750
-Darling! -Hello!

41:05.833 --> 41:08.417
Knapp!

41:10.167 --> 41:12.917
Jeans! Jeans!

41:13.000 --> 41:17.333
-What beauties! -Stop it.

41:17.417 --> 41:20.875
You'll get to meet my friends. They are terrible.

41:20.958 --> 41:23.792
I is a cigarette. -I'm thirsty!

41:23.875 --> 41:30.833
We are among those whose fate is a poison We are constantly utopia ...

41:47.000 --> 41:50.125
I did not think it was a mirror.

41:53.958 --> 41:57.917
The waiting patiently behind the guns have the upper hand.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.417
-Because I prefer Mussolini ... 'Oh, indeed?

42:02.500 --> 42:07.042
Compared with boobs are we here! Mussolini's policies ...

42:12.167 --> 42:19.500
Screen tests're the best. There are no strings attached, you go on feeling.

42:19.583 --> 42:24.125
I envy you. It reminds me of when I was new.

42:25.208 --> 42:30.500
And you have nothing to prove. You're not here for your acting ability ...

42:30.583 --> 42:34.625
-... but your gift. It's my sister who has the gift.

42:34.708 --> 42:38.125
Never mind. Thank and receive only.

42:38.208 --> 42:42.875
But I must admit that I do not believe in that stuff.

42:42.958 --> 42:47.375
I'm an incurable skeptic. Excuse my bluntness.

42:47.458 --> 42:51.375
Do you know where the word "skepticism" come from?

42:51.458 --> 42:54.375
From the Greek skeptikos, one investigating.

42:54.458 --> 42:59.083
-Who is he? -

42:59.167 --> 43:04.167
Eva Saïd. Professor Ulé,
specialist i metapsykologi.

43:04.250 --> 43:09.917
Meta-what? -

43:10.000 --> 43:14.708
-Enc hette han visst. -

43:18.250 --> 43:21.292
Or vet, miss ...

43:21.375 --> 43:25.458
Your laughter just spread the room-

43:25.542 --> 43:29.625
-will in the future might be able to play inside

43:29.708 --> 43:35.333
-with the help of a device that captures distant echoes from before to

43:35.417 --> 43:39.958
-Like to find fossils in the ground.

43:40.042 --> 43:43.708
You are in a sense ...

43:46.042 --> 43:49.875
We're all ghosts tomorrow.

43:49.958 --> 43:53.250
And we had a nice time!

43:53.333 --> 43:57.833
Forgive me, Professor. Continue.

43:57.917 --> 44:04.375
Who would have thought that one day it would be cameras-

44:04.458 --> 44:12.292
-As can reproduce a person's face, movements and voice?

44:12.375 --> 44:15.958
All the things that we take for Naturally you

44:16.042 --> 44:21.000
-framstod, before there was, like something out of a fool's fantasies.

44:21.083 --> 44:22.750
Tack.

44:22.833 --> 44:28.292
That only proves that none of us can predict the future.

44:28.375 --> 44:34.833
You probably did not succeed to convince Eve, but the last word is not said.

44:34.917 --> 44:39.292
You suffer when really of megalomania. How so?

44:39.375 --> 44:45.917
Then she began to go into psychoanalysis throws herself with such fancy words ...

44:46.000 --> 44:48.583
It's snowing.

44:48.667 --> 44:51.458
It's true. It's snowing really.

44:51.542 --> 44:55.125
-It's snowing! -Lets go out!

44:56.583 --> 45:02.583
This is quite disorganized! It's no fun!

45:14.750 --> 45:17.708
I have a lot?

45:19.917 --> 45:24.708
-See you on Friday as usual. It is no longer accustomed.

45:26.250 --> 45:28.458
Klang do not, you're too big!

45:28.542 --> 45:31.958
But I'm dizzy. You've been drinking too much.

45:32.042 --> 45:35.333
Come on! -I do not feel like it.

45:38.125 --> 45:41.292
-Darling! -Your pigs!

45:41.375 --> 45:44.542
What a dirty word in such a sweet mouth.

45:44.625 --> 45:46.833
Men left, women to the right!

45:46.917 --> 45:50.250
Where have you shoes? Come here.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.708
She's really beautiful. -Who then?

46:32.792 --> 46:34.667
Eva.

46:35.917 --> 46:38.958
Sure, she's beautiful.

47:00.542 --> 47:04.208
-A footstep. -Thanks.

47:04.292 --> 47:06.875
Good night.

47:08.083 --> 47:12.958
Funny. I've never been in here.

47:13.042 --> 47:18.458
But that's fine. It is cozy and secure.

47:18.542 --> 47:23.958
And so you have a view of the garden and the plants ...

47:24.042 --> 47:28.458
You see people as well, but only the legs.

47:30.583 --> 47:33.625
What good you have it.

47:53.167 --> 47:55.333
Tack.

47:58.875 --> 48:03.750
Since you came into my life, everything has changed.

48:05.917 --> 48:09.250
It is an important meeting for me.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.875
And.

48:12.958 --> 48:17.208
It probably sounds terribly trite.

48:17.292 --> 48:19.125
No!

48:20.542 --> 48:26.542
It's as if you've opened a door I can close.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.250
-Laura. -And?

48:32.333 --> 48:35.458
I want us to hold a seance.

48:35.542 --> 48:39.500
-Not? -Ja.

48:39.583 --> 48:43.542
I did not think you wanted more.

48:43.625 --> 48:48.917
And Kate asleep after all. She is very tired, and I agree.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.500
I'm not tired.

48:52.583 --> 48:55.042
I really want to.

49:49.250 --> 49:52.958
Kate? How was it?

49:57.417 --> 50:01.042
It was good. Or?

50:01.125 --> 50:02.792
And.

50:02.875 --> 50:05.833
Yes, it was good.

50:05.917 --> 50:09.708
It is not his brother.

50:20.833 --> 50:25.000
Prepare a room for systrarna Barlow on the guest floor.

50:25.083 --> 50:27.667
Ja, sir.

50:29.750 --> 50:32.875
It is the pink room.

50:40.375 --> 50:47.250
"They directed their affection needed against any brother in arms" ...

50:48.458 --> 50:56.250
... "and slept side by side under the same mantle of the stars shine bright."

50:56.333 --> 50:59.667
"Their constant drifting" ...

50:59.750 --> 51:03.208
What good it smells!

51:03.292 --> 51:07.333
-Do you have perfume on you? -No.

51:09.083 --> 51:10.625
How so?

51:25.542 --> 51:28.583
He just went.

52:59.083 --> 53:02.375
-Are you not eat? -I'm not hungry.

53:02.458 --> 53:05.583
You should eat. The soup warms.

53:07.875 --> 53:10.792
-What did you say? -Soppan ...

53:10.875 --> 53:13.167
Say that again.

53:20.625 --> 53:23.458
-Hi. -Hi.

53:23.542 --> 53:31.000
I tried not to be in the way. Maybe she'll teach me to cook it.

53:34.792 --> 53:36.958
Tack.

53:37.042 --> 53:41.333
-Did it taste good? -Excellent, thanks.

53:48.333 --> 53:53.125
Do you know why I never married? -No.

53:53.208 --> 53:57.000
I do not have to explain things.

53:57.083 --> 54:03.167
Suffice employees and shareholders. At home, I want to avoid.

54:03.250 --> 54:07.625
-Do you understand? -Kate, eat up.

54:07.708 --> 54:10.000
What? -We are going.

54:10.083 --> 54:14.333
-Sorry? You brought us here. We do not want to interfere.

54:14.417 --> 54:18.708
We're doing well on its own. I have food left.

54:18.792 --> 54:23.792
We need to be free. Sometimes it feels as if we are your servants.

54:23.875 --> 54:27.167
I hate that feeling! You're wrong.

54:27.250 --> 54:32.292
What do you expect from us? What do you want?

54:32.375 --> 54:36.000
What I want...? I want you to stay.

54:36.083 --> 54:38.833
I need you.

54:40.250 --> 54:44.250
Laura, I need you.

54:46.875 --> 54:49.167
Well then...

54:50.292 --> 54:52.375
Well then.

54:56.125 --> 54:59.000
Forgive me.

55:04.917 --> 55:08.167
May I finish eating?

55:15.750 --> 55:18.500
Have a nice meal!

55:21.417 --> 55:25.625
-Juncker! -Which dress!

55:25.708 --> 55:29.667
-Hungry? Do you mind if I eat? -No.

55:34.458 --> 55:37.875
-Reach? Tell me, then! -What?

55:37.958 --> 55:42.625
You did not come here just to compliment my dress.

55:42.708 --> 55:48.167
I'll close the club. The clouds are piling up, and I have found something better.

55:48.250 --> 55:53.000
-In Paris? -No. I put together a squad.

55:53.083 --> 55:56.167
-Follow. -But why?

55:56.250 --> 55:59.333
There is an audience out there.

55:59.417 --> 56:05.083
It is time for change. It is time to leave.

56:05.167 --> 56:08.167
Where are you going? Back to Berlin?

56:08.250 --> 56:12.292
With all that going on now? Hardly.

56:12.375 --> 56:15.583
Although I would like to, I can not.

56:15.667 --> 56:21.833
I have my team, and soon begins filming south. I have everything.

56:21.917 --> 56:24.750
I have a movie.

56:43.792 --> 56:45.917
Kate?

57:36.917 --> 57:40.708
Kate ... Come with me.

57:44.750 --> 57:49.417
What will this mean? How many sessions have you been?

57:49.500 --> 57:52.917
Look at me when I talk to you!

57:53.000 --> 57:55.417
How many?

57:57.042 --> 57:59.375
You're jealous.

58:18.708 --> 58:21.875
-Laura. -What?!

58:21.958 --> 58:26.625
Stay away from her! Do you hear it?

58:26.708 --> 58:30.458
So you need us? I know what it is you need.

58:30.542 --> 58:32.583
Sickening!

58:32.667 --> 58:35.667
What are you suggesting?

58:41.500 --> 58:44.333
You are wrong.

58:45.750 --> 58:49.625
You have not understood anything.

58:54.542 --> 59:00.500
-All is well? I'm glad we go.

59:00.583 --> 59:03.458
I want to see the sea.

59:06.250 --> 59:12.417
French Antonin Magne pulling away. German Weber buttons set.

59:12.500 --> 59:18.750
We now have a duel between Magne and Weber, and they approach the finish line ...

59:23.292 --> 59:26.875
And the victory goes to France!

59:38.833 --> 59:42.667
-What is happening? -Nothing.

1:00:10.708 --> 1:00:15.083
INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF META Psychology

1:00:26.042 --> 1:00:29.917
Can you wait to cash it?

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:35.292
-Just for the sake of posting. Sure, no problem.

1:00:48.167 --> 1:00:53.208
Here. It is laxative and diuretic. Completely harmless.

1:00:55.333 --> 1:00:57.542
Here you are.

1:00:58.583 --> 1:01:00.125
Great.

1:01:06.625 --> 1:01:10.917
Sit back as much as possible.

1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:16.375
-Like this? -Great. Can you take off your watch?

1:01:37.875 --> 1:01:41.292
Be prepared. We start about two, three minutes.

1:01:52.125 --> 1:01:54.375
Hurry, Korben.

1:01:54.458 --> 1:01:56.792
Is it going well?

1:03:22.958 --> 1:03:24.958
Laura?

1:03:26.208 --> 1:03:31.792
-How is it? You must be exhausted. I'm used to traveling.

1:03:31.875 --> 1:03:35.208
-Do you have a cigarette? -Yes.

1:03:35.292 --> 1:03:40.208
You rushed here unnecessarily. They go on strike tomorrow.

1:03:40.292 --> 1:03:45.792
-It can last for two or three days. -Two or three days? A strike?

1:03:45.875 --> 1:03:48.708
Yes.

1:03:48.792 --> 1:03:53.208
It whisper and tassles around Korben. -How?

1:03:53.292 --> 1:03:56.333
Gossip, rumors.

1:03:57.500 --> 1:04:00.458
What kind of rumors?

1:04:00.542 --> 1:04:05.125
Check out the poor fellow. Everyone is on him.

1:04:07.208 --> 1:04:14.083
And so it does not work with the family. He calls them every night ...

1:04:17.167 --> 1:04:20.875
Do not skimp. - I always liked poetry.

1:04:20.958 --> 1:04:25.417
People say that they write poetry, but it is wrong.

1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:28.333
It is the poetry writing us.

1:04:28.417 --> 1:04:34.208
Right? Yes, you have a hard time sometimes.

1:04:34.292 --> 1:04:37.625
He bit sometimes. He has asthma.

1:04:37.708 --> 1:04:41.583
He is fussy right now. He's probably a little depressed.

1:04:43.375 --> 1:04:45.333
Laura!

1:04:49.417 --> 1:04:55.000
You saved me! I did not know how I would get rid of him.

1:04:55.083 --> 1:04:57.500
Rescued?

1:04:57.583 --> 1:05:03.208
Yes, he has truly lost it. He just drank and drank.

1:05:03.292 --> 1:05:07.583
He may be an alcoholic. It is common in this profession.

1:05:07.667 --> 1:05:10.250
Look at me.

1:05:10.333 --> 1:05:14.750
He is kind, but a little ... please?

1:05:16.917 --> 1:05:22.458
I thought you were different. -So? In which way?

1:05:26.375 --> 1:05:30.417
-So you live then at Korben? -Yes.

1:05:33.250 --> 1:05:39.958
But you live with him or with him?

1:05:41.250 --> 1:05:42.958
With.

1:05:45.417 --> 1:05:50.583
Is it not strange to live there? -I do not know. It just so.

1:05:50.667 --> 1:05:56.333
Give me that! -You do not work when the sun is shining!

1:05:57.917 --> 1:06:00.250
Wait!

1:06:00.333 --> 1:06:04.667
I did not bring my bathing suit. -Nevermind!

1:06:28.083 --> 1:06:31.833
Come on! -I'm coming!

1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.917
I'll cool off a little.

1:07:16.208 --> 1:07:22.208
Tomorrow's strike

1:07:27.292 --> 1:07:33.583
And on Tuesday, the strike ...

1:07:52.333 --> 1:07:54.375
Come on.

1:08:04.125 --> 1:08:08.417
Louis? What kind of rumors?

1:08:08.500 --> 1:08:12.042
-About what? -Korben.

1:08:20.208 --> 1:08:24.250
-What are you doing? -You will see.

1:08:24.333 --> 1:08:27.958
In my job, you always have graced the benefits of it.

1:08:28.042 --> 1:08:32.208
Yes, stuff. Equipment.

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.125
Why are you showing me this?

1:08:45.542 --> 1:08:50.792
Why is it here? -Do not you recognize him?

1:08:51.833 --> 1:08:54.375
I do not want to.

1:08:56.542 --> 1:08:59.458
Look, then. It is Korben.

1:09:06.875 --> 1:09:10.875
There you will see well that it is not he?

1:09:12.750 --> 1:09:19.583
Why do you do this? Why do you want to hurt him?

1:09:19.667 --> 1:09:22.542
Take it easy. Are you neat?

1:09:22.625 --> 1:09:26.708
-Let get my stuff! -Go away!

1:09:26.792 --> 1:09:28.625
Not!

1:09:34.958 --> 1:09:40.333
One, two, three, four, five.

1:09:43.417 --> 1:09:45.542
Who is it?

1:09:46.708 --> 1:09:50.750
Are you okay? Here you get a gift.

1:09:55.167 --> 1:10:00.958
I know that all this is hard for you and I do not want to pressure you.

1:10:01.042 --> 1:10:03.958
-Are you doing alright? -Yes.

1:10:04.042 --> 1:10:07.500
Tell me who it is. -It's true.

1:10:08.542 --> 1:10:10.792
How nice.

1:10:12.333 --> 1:10:16.500
-Do you still do not know who he is? -No.

1:10:17.708 --> 1:10:21.333
I do not know who it is or what he wants.

1:10:21.417 --> 1:10:25.500
I try to think of it, but you can not.

1:10:25.583 --> 1:10:29.542
I look forward to the next seance.

1:10:29.625 --> 1:10:35.083
People think that we evoke those who have been important to us.

1:10:35.167 --> 1:10:37.542
But it's the other way around.

1:10:37.625 --> 1:10:41.958
The ghosts are often people we have been the major advantages

1:10:42.042 --> 1:10:48.250
But we have overlooked. Sometimes it means nothing at all.

1:10:48.333 --> 1:10:52.500
They come back because they are not clear to us.

1:11:03.333 --> 1:11:09.625
We must not run too long. The radiation can be harmful.

1:11:09.708 --> 1:11:14.708
If everything works, it should reasonably be able to clearly återge

1:11:18.875 --> 1:11:24.375
-Outstanding! But do not hope too much.

1:11:24.458 --> 1:11:27.125
Hurry, Korben.

1:12:18.625 --> 1:12:21.542
It's my father.

1:12:30.250 --> 1:12:36.333
When I was a child, he used to show me the rabbits. Then he disappeared.

1:12:44.208 --> 1:12:47.750
Is this where you are now?

1:12:47.833 --> 1:12:51.792
You look like a bum.

1:12:51.875 --> 1:12:56.917
Is that your friends do that? Your new family?

1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.292
You have no family anymore.

1:13:00.375 --> 1:13:03.875
The prayer was dedicated to your mother.

1:13:03.958 --> 1:13:07.167
What dusty it is.

1:13:07.250 --> 1:13:13.417
Help me, then! You are never here when they need you.

1:13:16.083 --> 1:13:18.958
I'm going home now.

1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.583
See you.

1:13:47.958 --> 1:13:51.417
No, stay. Dad...

1:14:20.125 --> 1:14:23.042
Few of her that thing!

1:14:24.125 --> 1:14:27.458
Take off her hood.

1:14:31.042 --> 1:14:35.458
Say. Say.

1:14:42.125 --> 1:14:47.125
-It went well. It went well. -Yes.

1:14:50.375 --> 1:14:52.833
It went well.

1:14:52.917 --> 1:14:56.250
Are you coming? I'm finished.

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:07.542
I asked them short of your pants. They were a little big.

1:15:07.625 --> 1:15:13.125
But it'll work out. The shoes were unfortunately only in size 37th

1:15:13.208 --> 1:15:15.792
JUDENS HORA

1:15:15.875 --> 1:15:19.250
We can put in the soles.

1:15:19.333 --> 1:15:24.708
Then they become a little less, so the fall is not off.

1:15:24.792 --> 1:15:28.125
And so you will not stumble.

1:15:29.417 --> 1:15:32.417
It will be better for you.

1:15:50.042 --> 1:15:54.000
-Silence. -Tagning!

1:16:00.500 --> 1:16:03.417
Break! Break!

1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:06.125
Where is Lefebvre?

1:16:06.208 --> 1:16:10.417
Okay, here we go in time.

1:17:03.125 --> 1:17:06.333
What's the matter? You are stunned.

1:17:06.417 --> 1:17:09.625
I freeze some just.

1:17:09.708 --> 1:17:15.875
No, you're scared. It is understandable. It is a strange job we have.

1:17:16.958 --> 1:17:22.958
But you're really good at what you do. If you are afraid, just look at me.

1:17:23.042 --> 1:17:27.417
And if you are unsure of a scene, you're looking at me. Come on!

1:17:27.500 --> 1:17:29.417
Fernand!

1:17:30.500 --> 1:17:33.833
-Thanks. -We're coming! - Come on!

1:17:42.250 --> 1:17:47.667
Kate Barlow has call from Laura Barlow.

1:17:47.750 --> 1:17:50.333
Kate?

1:17:50.417 --> 1:17:53.042
Yes it's me.

1:17:53.125 --> 1:17:56.292
Tell the other to be careful.

1:17:56.375 --> 1:17:58.750
But what?

1:17:58.833 --> 1:18:02.542
-All. -Ok I will do that.

1:18:02.625 --> 1:18:06.708
Speaking on. Tell me how you feel.

1:18:06.792 --> 1:18:10.875
Good. I feel good.

1:18:10.958 --> 1:18:14.125
What strange.

1:18:15.250 --> 1:18:21.875
We have never been heard on the phone before, never been apart.

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:27.417
It is as if I hear your voice for the first time.

1:18:27.500 --> 1:18:32.083
I know. It's a weird feeling.

1:18:33.917 --> 1:18:37.125
What are you doing?

1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.500
-Professorn. -Reach?

1:19:12.500 --> 1:19:17.292
As a terrible confession. It is grief over your whole future life.

1:19:17.375 --> 1:19:20.583
"You've always wanted to try our best, his very best."

1:19:20.667 --> 1:19:25.000
You're not there, Sylvette. -I try to.

1:19:44.875 --> 1:19:48.375
Look carefully, it is very volatile.

1:20:17.375 --> 1:20:20.500
Where now, now it will.

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.125
Where!

1:20:25.167 --> 1:20:28.792
Where! There it is!

1:20:33.125 --> 1:20:35.208
Where...!

1:20:38.208 --> 1:20:40.625
There you have it.

1:21:00.333 --> 1:21:03.458
Is not it remarkable?

1:21:05.458 --> 1:21:08.583
I go to my room.

1:21:10.167 --> 1:21:16.083
André, that's quite clear. What are we having this happen?

1:21:16.167 --> 1:21:21.125
Servier probably could have gotten something better with the help of special effects.

1:21:21.208 --> 1:21:24.875
I do not know. What should I say?

1:21:24.958 --> 1:21:28.708
The camera has devoured 2/3 of the budget. -Stop now.

1:21:45.333 --> 1:21:48.250
You promised not to.

1:21:52.417 --> 1:21:58.167
What are they called? 'Let the birds be. Sit here.

1:22:05.917 --> 1:22:11.708
You know that I love you? -Yes. And I you.

1:22:21.792 --> 1:22:27.292
-I am terribly sorry. -For what?

1:22:28.792 --> 1:22:34.333
-Because we never talked about it. -About what? I do not understand.

1:22:34.417 --> 1:22:38.792
-You know. -No, I do not.

1:22:40.708 --> 1:22:43.667
Yes you do.

1:22:45.750 --> 1:22:49.583
Are you saying that you also have seen things?

1:22:49.667 --> 1:22:52.917
It was not the same.

1:22:58.917 --> 1:23:04.458
-There will be no more seances, huh? -No. It's the end of it.

1:23:04.542 --> 1:23:09.708
-Barlow bor i rum 14.
-André?

1:23:09.792 --> 1:23:13.125
I go back to Paris.

1:23:13.208 --> 1:23:18.292
What do you mean? Are you going to abandon the team in the middle of filming?

1:23:18.375 --> 1:23:21.833
You have lost the understanding. -No!

1:23:21.917 --> 1:23:26.167
The images can not be used as they are, but they are a good foundation.

1:23:26.250 --> 1:23:32.208
I wake up from a long nightmare. I do not care if you burned the money.

1:23:32.292 --> 1:23:38.875
-Not money, my money. -There that bothers me ...

1:23:38.958 --> 1:23:42.083
... is that I lost confidence in you.

1:23:42.167 --> 1:23:46.125
There is nothing in those pictures.

1:23:46.208 --> 1:23:50.875
You are completely way off, and you do not notice it even.

1:23:50.958 --> 1:23:54.208
Wake up, Andre. Listen to me.

1:23:54.292 --> 1:23:57.333
Wake!

1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:01.125
Nothing?

1:24:02.375 --> 1:24:04.917
No, you're exaggerating.

1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:08.583
Please, stop.

1:24:14.833 --> 1:24:18.042
I do not believe you!

1:24:18.125 --> 1:24:23.500
Why are you so upset? We do not need the money anymore.

1:24:23.583 --> 1:24:29.292
Have you noticed that our life has changed? I make movies now.

1:24:29.375 --> 1:24:34.583
Soon, we can handle ourselves. It will be like old times. We do not even André.

1:24:34.667 --> 1:24:39.208
I like Andre. -I know. I also.

1:24:39.292 --> 1:24:43.500
But it is I who will take care of you.

1:24:43.583 --> 1:24:49.833
You have to go to school, socialize with peers, laugh ...

1:24:49.917 --> 1:24:55.208
-I still laughing. It does not at all.

1:24:57.708 --> 1:25:02.750
Kate? You are stunned. Are you okay?

1:25:06.167 --> 1:25:09.208
Kate! Kate!

1:25:09.292 --> 1:25:11.875
Help!

1:25:14.208 --> 1:25:17.375
-Take me a doctor! -Download doctor!

1:25:17.458 --> 1:25:23.208
She was absent, and then I saw that there was blood in the ears.

1:25:23.292 --> 1:25:25.958
Is she in puberty?

1:25:27.208 --> 1:25:30.333
No I do not think so.

1:25:31.375 --> 1:25:34.500
-Did she often dizziness? -Quite.

1:25:34.583 --> 1:25:37.833
- -

1:25:37.917 --> 1:25:41.333
-Sleeping problems? -Yes.

1:25:49.208 --> 1:25:52.833
-Have it happened in school too? She does not go to school.

1:25:52.917 --> 1:25:57.208
-Why not? We hold sessions.

1:25:57.292 --> 1:26:00.375
What does that mean?

1:26:00.458 --> 1:26:06.625
She establishes contact between the living and the dead ....

1:26:12.875 --> 1:26:17.750
It does not look good. It could be leukemia.

1:26:28.125 --> 1:26:31.208
Quiet with you! Silent!

1:26:35.708 --> 1:26:38.458
Lay down.

1:26:38.542 --> 1:26:42.042
There there.

1:26:54.375 --> 1:26:57.083
Say.

1:27:00.375 --> 1:27:05.792
There is a poem about birds that I like very much.

1:27:05.875 --> 1:27:09.958
Should I read it? Do you want that?

1:27:11.458 --> 1:27:16.583
Of that which has wings, I can never get enough

1:27:16.667 --> 1:27:20.667
As a child I often went out in my forest

1:27:20.750 --> 1:27:25.292
From a bona I lifted birds so small

1:27:25.375 --> 1:27:30.125
and put them in cages of straw

1:27:30.208 --> 1:27:36.083
I let them grow among moss and green

1:27:36.167 --> 1:27:40.917
Eventually I put the windows ajar

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.125
They did not fly cow ...

1:27:52.583 --> 1:27:57.583
I do not wanna die. You will not die.

1:27:57.667 --> 1:28:01.167
Yes, I will.

1:28:01.250 --> 1:28:05.167
But you will not be sorry.

1:28:06.667 --> 1:28:10.542
I will not die because of the seances.

1:28:12.542 --> 1:28:18.958
It is because of that I will die as I had it.

1:28:19.042 --> 1:28:21.208
The Gift.

1:28:22.667 --> 1:28:26.167
I am destined to meet the dead.

1:28:27.375 --> 1:28:30.792
I'm meeting the dead.

1:28:33.917 --> 1:28:38.667
Do you think me, Laura? -I believe you.

1:28:53.792 --> 1:28:56.458
I believe you.

1:28:59.875 --> 1:29:04.833
I do not know how she behaves. I've never done.

1:29:04.917 --> 1:29:12.375
-What are you talking about? Her gift? Yes, André. The Gift.

1:29:12.458 --> 1:29:17.167
To do so people can see what they really want to see.

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:25.375
And men like you, even the really skeptiska-

1:29:25.458 --> 1:29:29.333
-have ultimately believed in everything.

1:29:29.417 --> 1:29:33.125
Although they knew it was not true.

1:29:34.167 --> 1:29:38.125
Everything else is just a figment.

1:29:40.417 --> 1:29:43.500
That's what you think.

1:29:44.958 --> 1:29:50.125
Is there a collective hallucination? Is everyone blind?

1:29:51.833 --> 1:29:58.000
Are all the rumors unfounded? The shareholders demand an explanation.

1:29:58.083 --> 1:30:03.500
I will tell them that you are leaving, Monsieur Korben.

1:30:03.583 --> 1:30:06.500
-Sorry? -Ni heard.

1:30:08.542 --> 1:30:10.500
Men...

1:30:10.583 --> 1:30:17.167
You can have a look at the accounts. All expenses have been justified.

1:30:17.250 --> 1:30:21.458
It is quite normal payments.

1:30:21.542 --> 1:30:25.250
You let you be seduced by an ugly smear campaign.

1:30:25.333 --> 1:30:29.667
What the film is concerned ... film was, yes.

1:30:29.750 --> 1:30:35.208
- Sure, we can talk about.

1:30:35.292 --> 1:30:37.042
Enter?

1:30:43.208 --> 1:30:46.125
Resign without protest, André.

1:30:46.208 --> 1:30:50.917
The question is rather how to avoid a trial.

1:30:56.333 --> 1:30:59.208
I understand.

1:31:00.250 --> 1:31:06.167
It is a difficult job to lead the men's company.

1:31:06.250 --> 1:31:11.125
Now do you want me to slaughter. Sue me you. I am waiting.

1:31:11.208 --> 1:31:15.708
No money has ever fallen into my own pocket.

1:31:15.792 --> 1:31:20.917
Every franc has gone into making the film - and you know it.

1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:26.375
The French money, maybe. But the foreign, then?

1:31:26.458 --> 1:31:30.625
What ... I do not understand what you are referring to.

1:31:30.708 --> 1:31:36.000
Is it the English-speaking employees again, so you get actually give you.

1:31:36.083 --> 1:31:40.833
Why are you trying to justify yourself, Monsieur Korbinski?

1:31:42.083 --> 1:31:48.542
Forgive me, but how can we trust a foreigner in these times?

1:31:52.167 --> 1:31:59.708
I'm afraid that you are making a mistake. I'm just as French as you.

1:32:01.208 --> 1:32:03.583
Shameful!

1:33:11.292 --> 1:33:14.875
A cup of coffee, at least?

1:33:16.125 --> 1:33:18.208
Sure, why not?

1:33:21.917 --> 1:33:25.042
-Thanks. -No problems.

1:33:30.625 --> 1:33:32.375
Tack.

1:33:33.417 --> 1:33:36.833
-Laura? -No thanks.

1:33:38.667 --> 1:33:43.542
Why, what are you doing here? You should rest.

1:33:47.958 --> 1:33:52.042
-Gott coffee. Yes, the set fine.

1:34:01.500 --> 1:34:05.625
How is it going? What is happening?

1:34:40.167 --> 1:34:43.417
Since then, gentlemen ...

1:34:56.917 --> 1:35:00.833
Say. It's going to be alright.

1:35:00.917 --> 1:35:04.000
It will be alright.

1:35:04.083 --> 1:35:07.583
You? Look at me.

1:35:09.208 --> 1:35:13.458
Rest yourself properly and do all that is needed.

1:35:22.583 --> 1:35:26.083
-Now we have to go. -Yes.

1:35:31.417 --> 1:35:35.000
Do not worry, dear.

1:35:55.125 --> 1:35:58.500
-How is she? -Good.

1:35:58.583 --> 1:36:01.750
It is said to be a clinic in Biarritz.

1:36:01.833 --> 1:36:05.833
It will be fine. They will take care of her.

1:36:05.917 --> 1:36:09.125
Obvious. Did you post the display?

1:36:09.208 --> 1:36:12.042
And.

1:36:12.125 --> 1:36:15.542
Do not worry. This is a misunderstanding.

1:36:15.625 --> 1:36:21.042
But have you seen the papers? I do not care if people gossip.

1:36:21.125 --> 1:36:26.667
Gossip? How can you be so blind, André?

1:36:26.750 --> 1:36:30.875
It's not gossip, it's hatred.

1:36:32.167 --> 1:36:38.250
I have written a letter to the Minister of Justice. Soon it's over.

1:36:38.333 --> 1:36:43.750
I have been deprived of my French nationality. There he is to be changed

1:36:43.833 --> 1:36:47.833
But as a foreign prisoner can not I write to the minister.

1:36:47.917 --> 1:36:55.375
Take the letter and give it to him. He is a good friend. Here, take it.

1:36:55.458 --> 1:37:00.500
-You can be calm. -You have to believe in justice.

1:37:00.583 --> 1:37:04.375
Laura, look at me.

1:37:08.333 --> 1:37:14.000
It's funny. Yesterday I dreamed that strange.

1:37:16.875 --> 1:37:21.500
You were with. -Continue.

1:37:21.583 --> 1:37:24.667
It was a wedding. -Your?

1:37:24.750 --> 1:37:27.375
Our.

1:37:29.042 --> 1:37:36.250
Kate was also there, but there were no guests, no one enda-

1:37:36.333 --> 1:37:40.042
-so I hired extras.

1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:50.792
We carried around on chairs, all three. We laughed, and so ...

1:37:50.875 --> 1:37:53.542
... we kissed.

1:37:54.625 --> 1:37:59.958
The orchestra played a tune from my childhood.

1:38:04.625 --> 1:38:07.875
And then...?

1:38:07.958 --> 1:38:12.083
Then ... there was nothing more.

1:38:15.125 --> 1:38:18.500
Are you saying that I am your dream woman?

1:38:22.333 --> 1:38:24.917
Perhaps.

1:38:28.750 --> 1:38:31.250
Perhaps.

1:39:09.417 --> 1:39:16.333
André Korbinski, född
den 21 april 1887 i Gdansk i Polen.

1:39:16.417 --> 1:39:21.083
Nationality: Polish. Have a seat.

1:39:21.167 --> 1:39:25.458
-A question. I will not respond to any questions.

1:39:25.542 --> 1:39:29.750
What is this? You do not shoot well?

1:39:29.833 --> 1:39:34.292
Please do not shoot! No no!

1:39:34.375 --> 1:39:38.708
I do not play. This is not a comedy. It is a tragedy!

1:39:38.792 --> 1:39:43.167
Please do not shoot! Shoot me!

1:39:43.250 --> 1:39:47.458
Stop shooting! Stop filming me! Stop!

1:39:47.542 --> 1:39:52.083
The film does not. Please, shoot me.

1:39:57.917 --> 1:40:00.125
Have you heard anything?

1:40:00.208 --> 1:40:04.375
He sent east two months ago.

1:40:06.333 --> 1:40:09.708
-Since when? -Nothing.

1:40:09.792 --> 1:40:12.792
You hear about a lot of terrible things.

1:40:12.875 --> 1:40:16.500
-People talk so much. -Maybe it.

1:40:16.583 --> 1:40:20.875
It is sad to say, but it's probably best not to believe in anything at all.

1:40:20.958 --> 1:40:24.625
Do not expect anything, but hope for all.

1:40:30.250 --> 1:40:32.875
How is she?

1:41:14.042 --> 1:41:17.667
Kate passed away last winter.

1:41:31.042 --> 1:41:35.417
Servier might have a role for you.

1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:41.708
It's nothing big, but it can lead to more jobs.

1:41:45.875 --> 1:41:50.833
-Go there and the health of me. Thanks, Eva.

1:42:11.875 --> 1:42:16.875
Then we roll right. Can we have silence, please?

1:42:25.083 --> 1:42:28.042
Silence!

1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.958
Do not Cry.

1:42:36.042 --> 1:42:37.708
Action!

1:42:45.542 --> 1:42:47.750
Nanny?

1:42:49.958 --> 1:42:55.417
Nanny, wake up! Bring the kids, this must see!

1:42:55.500 --> 1:42:59.458
-What is it? Is everything okay? -If it is!

1:42:59.542 --> 1:43:02.625
The orphanage is saved!

1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:09.083
Wake up, baby! Come, and you will see.

1:43:11.125 --> 1:43:14.625
Look! Starburst!

1:43:16.708 --> 1:43:23.292
So beautiful! In the evening, we thank our lucky stars. Sing, baby!

1:43:43.750 --> 1:43:46.625
The sky is perfectly clear.

1:43:48.333 --> 1:43:52.167
It will be a glorious day in the morning.

1:43:52.250 --> 1:43:55.708
Absolutely brilliant.
