WEBVTT

00:02.532 --> 00:05.733
She has no identification,
no wallet, keys,

00:05.853 --> 00:07.683
and she wouldn't talk to the cops.

00:07.751 --> 00:09.854
So they dropped her on our doorstep?

00:09.922 --> 00:12.140
When I was on the force,
we used to do that all the time.

00:12.260 --> 00:15.933
Involuntary psychiatric hold.

00:16.001 --> 00:18.603
You know, we cut out
a lot of paperwork.

00:21.739 --> 00:22.873
Wait here.

00:22.941 --> 00:24.074
You got it.

00:27.176 --> 00:29.212
What's your name?

00:29.279 --> 00:32.183
I hear you caused
quite a disturbance tonight.

00:32.252 --> 00:36.689
Some anti-Semitic remark
set you off.

00:36.756 --> 00:38.623
They made a joke.

00:38.691 --> 00:40.958
The businessmen at the bar.

00:41.026 --> 00:43.860
They said,
"Don't let them Jew you down."

00:43.928 --> 00:45.418
That's how it always starts, you know?

00:45.526 --> 00:47.360
With jokes.

00:47.427 --> 00:49.328
There's blood on your coat there.

00:49.396 --> 00:50.763
Is it yours?
It's theirs.

00:50.831 --> 00:52.399
I broke a beer bottle.
I stabbed them.

00:52.466 --> 00:54.400
They will live, but...

00:54.468 --> 00:56.470
they will never forget.

00:56.538 --> 00:58.272
I'm not immune

00:58.340 --> 01:00.307
to the atrocities
your people suffered.

01:00.375 --> 01:03.311
Did you lose someone in the war?

01:13.957 --> 01:15.826
We'll start treatment
first thing in the morning.

01:16.393 --> 01:17.852
Lock her up.

01:36.093 --> 01:37.822
Am I going to die?

01:38.555 --> 01:40.188
Not exactly.

01:40.256 --> 01:41.923
As a matter of fact,

01:41.991 --> 01:44.692
after this, you'll
probably live forever.

03:07.450 --> 03:10.118
I could sure use
a cigarette about now.

03:16.728 --> 03:18.062
Arden?

03:19.058 --> 03:20.625
Where is it?

03:21.694 --> 03:22.928
That son of a bitch.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.763
<i>No fresh incisions</i>

03:24.831 --> 03:27.699
to indicate surgical implantation.

03:27.767 --> 03:30.868
What'd it do, crawl back inside you?

03:33.620 --> 03:35.687
Through which orifice?

03:35.755 --> 03:37.789
What are you talking about?

03:39.258 --> 03:40.625
Yeah, he smacked me around,

03:40.692 --> 03:41.993
shot me with X-rays...

03:43.122 --> 03:45.063
That thing he found on my neck.

03:55.541 --> 03:58.477
The tracer from
the creatures in the sky?

03:58.545 --> 04:00.846
You still believe me, don't you?

04:00.914 --> 04:02.949
Yeah, of course.

04:04.985 --> 04:06.886
But it doesn't matter what I believe.

04:06.954 --> 04:07.880
It does.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.895
Especially in this place.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.823
Your story is who you are.

04:10.891 --> 04:12.321
I wish I could forget my story.

04:12.441 --> 04:14.610
No, you have to say it
out loud all the time

04:14.730 --> 04:17.430
just to keep it straight in your head.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.600
Tell me.

04:20.668 --> 04:22.275
Tell me your story.
I won't judge you.

04:25.455 --> 04:28.825
I can still hear the sound
if I let myself.

04:32.496 --> 04:34.364
You hear something?

04:35.700 --> 04:37.534
What's going on?

04:37.601 --> 04:39.936
What time is it?

04:40.004 --> 04:41.672
Stay here.

05:12.605 --> 05:13.739
Grace...

05:31.890 --> 05:33.791
Get back here!

05:48.075 --> 05:50.977
I lost my father
and my stepmother that night.

05:51.044 --> 05:54.847
I lost my stepsister the next day

05:54.915 --> 05:56.783
when she accused me of murdering them.

05:59.153 --> 06:01.955
Red and Patsy were secretly lovers.

06:02.022 --> 06:04.290
They wanted the farm for themselves.

06:04.358 --> 06:07.760
They planned every detail
to convince the police,

06:07.828 --> 06:11.531
and no matter how many times
I told my story,

06:11.599 --> 06:14.200
no one would believe me.

06:18.161 --> 06:19.992
I believe you.

06:23.811 --> 06:25.913
I loved the farm.

06:25.981 --> 06:28.549
I miss the horses the most.

06:28.617 --> 06:31.118
The freedom I felt riding them.

06:31.186 --> 06:33.821
Like I was flying.

06:33.889 --> 06:36.123
You'll fly again.

06:42.131 --> 06:45.700
Where did you go during
the movie, Lana?

06:45.768 --> 06:49.203
I... I told you,
I excused myself.

06:50.940 --> 06:52.907
I'm not going to say a word
to Sister Jude.

06:52.975 --> 06:54.376
I would have done that already

06:54.443 --> 06:56.178
if I thought that's what was needed.

07:01.180 --> 07:02.818
You reappeared.

07:02.886 --> 07:05.987
You, Kit and Grace.

07:06.055 --> 07:08.490
<i>The Mexican,</i>

07:08.558 --> 07:10.592
a sex-crazed deviant,

07:10.660 --> 07:12.294
and a pinhead

07:12.362 --> 07:14.967
won't get far in this storm.

07:15.087 --> 07:17.164
I hope they all drown out there.

07:17.232 --> 07:19.275
Lights out in ten minutes.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.602
All right, let's go.

07:22.561 --> 07:23.761
Shelley made it out.

07:23.829 --> 07:24.996
She got past whatever's out there.

07:25.064 --> 07:26.498
What the hell were they?

07:26.566 --> 07:28.233
We can never talk about that.

07:28.301 --> 07:30.670
If they know we got out,
it's the end of us.

07:35.776 --> 07:37.444
<i>Here's the thing, Lana.</i>

07:38.731 --> 07:40.347
You don't belong here.

07:40.414 --> 07:42.649
You're not a danger to society.

07:42.717 --> 07:44.852
You were right to try to escape.

07:46.821 --> 07:49.457
You headshrinkers are such hypocrites.

07:49.524 --> 07:51.626
According to your bible,

07:51.693 --> 07:54.762
the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical</i>
<i>Manual of Mental Disorders,</i>

07:54.830 --> 07:56.230
I'm sick.

07:56.298 --> 07:58.833
I have an illness.

07:58.901 --> 08:01.702
I believe I can help you.

08:01.770 --> 08:03.805
I'd like to try, if you'll let me.

08:03.872 --> 08:06.508
But I'm not even your patient.

08:06.575 --> 08:09.810
I see myself in you.

08:09.878 --> 08:11.324
You're thoughtful and intelligent.

08:11.444 --> 08:13.547
You have something to offer the world.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.493
And they can't keep you here

08:15.561 --> 08:17.059
if they don't have
a current diagnosis.

08:17.179 --> 08:18.730
If I can convince them
that I've cured you,

08:18.850 --> 08:20.631
they'll be forced to release you.

08:20.698 --> 08:22.966
Doctor, I have been this way since...

08:24.939 --> 08:26.302
...since I can remember.

08:28.093 --> 08:30.473
There is no cure.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.413
Your choice.

08:34.879 --> 08:36.145
I'm not like Sister Jude.

08:36.212 --> 08:37.746
I won't force you to do anything.

08:37.815 --> 08:39.148
But I also won't be here

08:39.216 --> 08:40.616
very much longer--
another week

08:40.683 --> 08:42.219
if we're lucky--
so if you want help

08:42.285 --> 08:43.419
getting out of this shithole...

08:44.732 --> 08:46.389
...we'd better jump in.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.606
You're a fish out of water, Lana,

08:48.726 --> 08:50.693
gasping for life.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.195
It won't end well.

08:52.262 --> 08:54.230
Trust me.

09:02.740 --> 09:05.808
<i>15th of November 1964.</i>

09:05.876 --> 09:07.221
<i>Dear Kitty:</i>

09:07.341 --> 09:10.880
<i>This relentlessly cheerful tune</i>
<i>never stops playing.</i>

09:10.948 --> 09:13.216
<i>The walls are closing in.</i>

09:13.284 --> 09:15.352
<i>I can hardly breathe.</i>

09:15.419 --> 09:17.187
<i>It's Amsterdam all over again.</i>

09:17.255 --> 09:19.924
<i>But there are eyes everywhere.</i>

09:19.992 --> 09:22.660
<i>These eyes of madness and disease.</i>

09:22.728 --> 09:25.830
<i>These people,</i>
<i>they are resigned to die here.</i>

09:25.898 --> 09:27.932
<i>We were never resigned.</i>

09:28.000 --> 09:30.935
<i>We always held on to a shred of hope.</i>

09:31.003 --> 09:33.471
Give me your pen.

09:33.539 --> 09:36.741
If they catch you writing,
they'll throw you in solitary.

09:37.612 --> 09:39.566
In spite of the
religious icons everywhere,

09:39.686 --> 09:41.445
this is a godless place.

09:41.513 --> 09:43.348
You might want a friend.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.585
Okay.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.854
I hope you like pain.

10:07.172 --> 10:08.322
Ah.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.840
You must be the new girl.

10:09.908 --> 10:11.842
You were there.

10:11.910 --> 10:13.410
What?
In Auschwitz.

10:13.478 --> 10:16.113
Nazi murderer!

10:16.180 --> 10:18.014
You Nazi swine!

10:18.082 --> 10:20.417
Take this one.
Murderer! Nazi swine!

10:20.484 --> 10:23.152
Don't you
remember me, Doctor?

10:23.220 --> 10:24.854
I am Anne.

10:24.922 --> 10:26.823
Anne Frank!

10:34.674 --> 10:36.708
So, Anne Frank, is it?

10:37.974 --> 10:40.820
What a relief it will be
to millions of schoolchildren

10:40.914 --> 10:42.748
to know you survived.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.717
You think I'm crazy.

10:44.784 --> 10:46.037
Anne Frank died,

10:46.157 --> 10:48.284
Bergen-Belsen, 1945.

10:48.404 --> 10:51.022
Just weeks before the camp
was liberated.

10:51.090 --> 10:53.391
There were so many bodies
when the Allies arrived--

10:53.459 --> 10:54.734
thousands...

10:54.854 --> 10:57.662
buried in mass graves--
but I wasn't one of them.

10:57.729 --> 10:59.030
I was too sick

10:59.097 --> 11:00.865
to tell anyone my name,

11:00.933 --> 11:02.633
even if they had asked.

11:02.701 --> 11:05.502
The Brits nursed us back
to some semblance of health.

11:05.570 --> 11:06.737
Afterwards, I kept to

11:06.805 --> 11:08.405
the streets in Germany.

11:08.473 --> 11:10.007
A pickpocket, a thief.

11:10.075 --> 11:11.241
And then I met a soldier.

11:11.361 --> 11:13.243
Private William Snow
of Rutherford, New Jersey.

11:13.311 --> 11:15.579
He saved me.

11:15.646 --> 11:16.947
He brought me to America.

11:17.014 --> 11:18.948
So you're a married lady.

11:19.016 --> 11:20.750
A widow.

11:20.818 --> 11:22.052
William was called back to service

11:22.119 --> 11:24.020
during the Korean Conflict.

11:24.591 --> 11:26.024
He was killed there in '52.

11:26.092 --> 11:27.504
That same year,

11:27.624 --> 11:29.372
my diary was published
here in America.

11:29.492 --> 11:30.696
Only then did I realize

11:30.799 --> 11:32.033
that Pim had survived the war.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.040
And you made

11:33.160 --> 11:37.305
no attempt to contact your father?

11:37.372 --> 11:39.374
I wanted to,

11:39.441 --> 11:40.312
at first.

11:40.432 --> 11:43.010
But he had a new family, a new life.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.979
But more than that, it was the diary.

11:45.046 --> 11:45.980
People finally

11:46.047 --> 11:47.147
started to pay attention

11:47.215 --> 11:48.549
to what they'd done to us.

11:48.617 --> 11:49.917
All because of

11:49.985 --> 11:52.253
a martyred 15-year-old girl.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.388
She had to stay 15.

11:54.456 --> 11:55.823
And a martyr.

11:55.891 --> 11:56.824
I could do

11:56.892 --> 11:58.592
more good dead than alive.

11:58.660 --> 12:00.060
Your story

12:00.128 --> 12:01.896
is indecent.

12:01.963 --> 12:03.664
No, you are indecent.

12:03.732 --> 12:06.533
You have a Nazi war
criminal working here.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.203
<i>I find myself in</i>

12:09.270 --> 12:11.838
a bit of an ethical dilemma, Kit.

12:11.906 --> 12:14.107
If I deem you as sane,
you'll almost certainly

12:14.175 --> 12:15.842
go to the electric chair, but if I...

12:15.910 --> 12:18.745
judge you unfit to stand trial,

12:18.813 --> 12:21.448
you'll be allowed to live out
the rest of your days here.

12:21.515 --> 12:25.018
So... what's the problem?

12:25.086 --> 12:27.076
The problem is I don't
think you're crazy.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.090
But I don't think you're evil.

12:29.157 --> 12:30.758
You think I'm innocent?

12:30.826 --> 12:32.893
In some ways, yes.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.096
The innocent victim
of a brutish society

12:35.163 --> 12:37.262
which drove you
to commit acts so terrible,

12:37.382 --> 12:40.382
so... antithetical
to who you are

12:40.502 --> 12:44.345
as a person that your psyche
concocted this elaborate fantasy

12:44.465 --> 12:48.343
about alien abduction to
absolve you of your guilt.

12:48.411 --> 12:50.178
No.

12:50.246 --> 12:51.346
That's not true.

12:51.414 --> 12:52.614
I believe it is.

12:52.682 --> 12:53.945
But I also believe that your death

12:54.065 --> 12:57.052
at the hands of the state
serves no moral purpose.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.967
Listen to me very carefully, Kit.

13:00.087 --> 13:03.659
I'm willing to lie to the courts
in order to save your life,

13:03.727 --> 13:06.001
but only under one condition:

13:06.121 --> 13:08.191
that for the rest of
our time together,

13:08.311 --> 13:12.100
you face the truth
of what you've done.

13:12.168 --> 13:14.203
If you can do that,

13:14.270 --> 13:17.206
then I'll be able to leave here
feeling I've done some good.

13:17.273 --> 13:19.808
I already told you what happened.

13:19.876 --> 13:20.809
Yes.

13:20.877 --> 13:22.711
Now let me tell you.

13:24.021 --> 13:26.260
<i>He wasn't called Arden then.</i>

13:26.668 --> 13:28.237
He was Gruper.

13:28.596 --> 13:30.068
Hans Gruper.

13:30.188 --> 13:31.553
He was SS.

13:31.673 --> 13:33.588
And he was not like the others.

13:33.656 --> 13:36.558
I saw him the night we
arrived in Auschwitz.

13:36.626 --> 13:38.560
That's where they sent us first.

13:44.967 --> 13:50.372
<i>He seemed kind... gentle.</i>

13:50.440 --> 13:53.742
<i>I remember that there were</i>
<i>two boys, twins,</i>

13:53.810 --> 13:56.454
<i>and when the guards</i>
<i>herded the other children away,</i>

13:56.574 --> 13:59.115
Gruper saved those twins.

13:59.696 --> 14:02.331
<i>I can recall thinking</i>
<i>that they were lucky.</i>

14:05.122 --> 14:07.624
But nobody was lucky in Auschwitz.

14:07.692 --> 14:09.517
I didn't know it then,

14:09.637 --> 14:12.462
but Dr. Gruper never
saved a single soul.

14:12.530 --> 14:14.297
He would visit us regularly

14:14.365 --> 14:16.166
in the women's barracks,
bring us sweets,

14:16.234 --> 14:17.792
<i>chocolates.</i>

14:17.912 --> 14:20.738
<i>The guards would never</i>
<i>strike us when he was present.</i>

14:20.806 --> 14:23.346
<i>He wanted to help, he said.</i>

14:23.466 --> 14:25.944
<i>But he couldn't treat</i>
<i>all the girls, he would say.</i>

14:26.011 --> 14:27.779
So he left it to chance.

14:37.623 --> 14:39.957
And when they came back,

14:40.025 --> 14:41.626
if they came back...

14:43.543 --> 14:45.102
...something had changed.

14:45.998 --> 14:47.906
<i>He had made them sick.</i>

14:48.026 --> 14:51.436
<i>Whatever he'd done to them.</i>

14:51.504 --> 14:53.705
<i>They'd be afraid to speak out.</i>

14:53.773 --> 14:57.442
<i>They'd be sworn to secrecy.</i>

14:57.510 --> 15:00.112
<i>You married Alma in secret.</i>

15:00.180 --> 15:02.715
You didn't feel you could tell anyone.

15:02.783 --> 15:05.351
And as time passed, what
should've been your greatest joy

15:05.419 --> 15:07.453
became your greatest shame.

15:07.521 --> 15:09.789
And the pressure in you built
and needed a release.

15:09.856 --> 15:12.358
And it found one.

15:14.271 --> 15:16.463
On... January 16,

15:16.531 --> 15:18.466
<i>Donna Burton, a librarian,</i>
<i>was abducted from</i>

15:18.586 --> 15:20.095
<i>the Wausaukee County Library--</i>

15:20.215 --> 15:23.203
<i>a short drive from the</i>
<i>gas station where you worked.</i>

15:25.874 --> 15:28.209
Her remains were found two days later.

15:28.277 --> 15:30.612
Her skin had been removed.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.883
So had her head.

15:36.029 --> 15:37.987
Why the skin, Kit?

15:38.054 --> 15:40.155
Why the head?

15:40.223 --> 15:40.884
I don't know.

15:41.004 --> 15:42.517
Her race?

15:42.637 --> 15:44.860
Her identity?
The very things about Alma

15:44.928 --> 15:46.295
society was punishing you for?

15:46.363 --> 15:47.196
No.

15:49.465 --> 15:52.434
It happened again in March.

15:52.501 --> 15:55.269
Allison Rydell,

15:55.337 --> 15:58.172
a secretary, was taken
outside of her home.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.174
Then it happened to Alma.

16:00.242 --> 16:02.643
The night it happened,

16:02.711 --> 16:05.796
you said you had been
visited at work by friends.

16:06.476 --> 16:08.495
<i>You said that they were suspicious,</i>

16:08.615 --> 16:10.617
<i>that they followed you home.</i>

16:12.577 --> 16:14.221
But it wasn't them.

16:14.288 --> 16:16.490
Of course it was, Kit.

16:18.192 --> 16:19.893
<i>Kit? Kit?</i>

16:19.961 --> 16:23.473
<i>And maybe Alma</i>
<i>had had enough of the hiding,</i>

16:23.593 --> 16:24.970
<i>of the shame.</i>

16:25.267 --> 16:27.467
And when she confronted
you about it, you snapped.

16:30.174 --> 16:33.973
<i>Your rage at Alma's shame had</i>
<i>finally found its real target.</i>

16:35.775 --> 16:39.446
You killed the thing
you loved the most.

16:43.584 --> 16:46.886
It wasn't me.

16:46.953 --> 16:48.521
It wasn't him.

16:48.589 --> 16:49.889
I know what I saw.

16:49.957 --> 16:52.251
You didn't see anything,

16:52.371 --> 16:54.760
because you weren't there.

16:55.591 --> 16:57.863
I know where I came from, Sister.

16:57.931 --> 16:59.498
Can you say the same
about your Dr. Arden?

17:10.911 --> 17:12.479
<i>From the</i> Commonwealth Gazette

17:12.547 --> 17:14.414
<i>in Western Massachusetts,</i>

17:14.482 --> 17:17.585
<i>for her searing,</i>
<i>six-part exposé</i>

17:17.652 --> 17:21.122
<i>of the horrific mental health</i>
<i>abuses at Briarcliff Manor,</i>

17:21.190 --> 17:23.008
<i>home for the criminally insane,</i>

17:23.127 --> 17:25.704
<i>where she was held against her will</i>

17:25.825 --> 17:29.231
and subjected to unspeakable torture,

17:29.298 --> 17:31.800
the brave Miss Lana Winters.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.011
Thank you.

17:43.679 --> 17:47.416
I want to thank my real heroes:

17:47.484 --> 17:49.385
the other inmates at Briarcliff,

17:49.453 --> 17:53.156
whose stories broke my heart
and inspired me to survive.

17:53.223 --> 17:55.525
Like Martha.

17:55.593 --> 17:57.661
They say when she first arrived,

17:57.728 --> 17:59.730
she was young and beautiful.

17:59.797 --> 18:01.632
She had suffered a nervous breakdown

18:01.699 --> 18:03.066
after her husband committed suicide.

18:03.134 --> 18:04.701
When I met her,

18:04.769 --> 18:05.936
she banged her head against the wall

18:06.004 --> 18:07.704
pretty much every single day.

18:07.772 --> 18:09.473
And Rudy.

18:09.540 --> 18:11.944
Diagnosed as a chronic masturbator,

18:12.064 --> 18:15.612
Sister Jude's cane did
little to help his habit.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.180
In fact, he got worse.

18:18.716 --> 18:22.185
They tried hard to crush my spirit.

18:26.123 --> 18:28.491
"Something there is
that doesn't love a wall

18:29.755 --> 18:33.998
"That sends the
frozen-ground-swell under it,

18:34.066 --> 18:35.776
And..."

18:35.896 --> 18:40.671
<i>To destroy my mind</i>
<i>so I'd forget what I saw.</i>

18:40.739 --> 18:43.875
"...the upper boulders
in the sun..."

18:47.246 --> 18:51.249
I did everything
I could think of to survive.

18:57.232 --> 18:59.892
<i>And then I did what I had to do</i>
<i>to get out.</i>

19:08.301 --> 19:10.335
How soon can we begin your therapy?

19:20.846 --> 19:23.414
Are you seeing Sister Jude's
face in the dough?

19:23.482 --> 19:26.251
I want to punch her, too, for
making us work double shifts.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.854
What if I am crazy?

19:29.922 --> 19:31.473
Huh? What if I imagined
the whole thing?

19:31.593 --> 19:34.125
The spaceship,
the creatures, Alma abducted.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.528
What if... what if
I made it all up

19:36.595 --> 19:38.463
because I couldn't face
up to what I'd done?

19:38.531 --> 19:40.341
Why are you saying this now?

19:40.461 --> 19:41.974
Dr. Thredson, he...

19:42.094 --> 19:44.437
he said some things that
are starting to make sense.

19:44.504 --> 19:47.741
Well, if you were crazy,
they wouldn't make sense to you.

19:47.808 --> 19:50.978
Self-doubt is
a sure sign of sanity.

19:51.045 --> 19:53.581
Wait, you're confusing me.

19:53.648 --> 19:56.851
If... you're saying
that if I'm crazy,

19:56.919 --> 19:59.253
then I wouldn't believe
Dr. Thredson, but if I'm sane,

19:59.321 --> 20:00.922
then my crazy stories would be true?

20:00.989 --> 20:02.957
I have no idea what you just said.

20:07.496 --> 20:08.863
What am I?

20:10.867 --> 20:12.367
Crazy or sane?

20:16.672 --> 20:17.906
Am I a killer?

20:19.763 --> 20:21.643
I don't care.

20:21.711 --> 20:23.779
Whatever you are,

20:23.846 --> 20:26.681
I'll be with you.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.513
I've taken the liberty
of choosing one, Sister Jude.

21:27.592 --> 21:31.528
A cane befitting
their... transgression.

21:31.596 --> 21:34.365
I don't know what's gotten
into you lately, Sister,

21:34.432 --> 21:36.856
but it's a decided improvement.

21:38.337 --> 21:42.440
You two...
are far too familiar.

21:42.508 --> 21:45.877
You're drawn to each other
like the serpent and the apple.

21:45.945 --> 21:49.447
Are you purposely trying
to make a murder baby?

21:49.515 --> 21:51.249
Grace didn't kill anyone.

21:51.317 --> 21:53.942
She told me her story;
she was framed.

21:54.164 --> 21:56.057
Just give us our beating
and get it over with.

21:56.177 --> 22:00.258
I think a more reliable step
needs to be taken:

22:00.326 --> 22:03.795
sterilization, for the both of you.

22:03.863 --> 22:05.569
You can't do that.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.334
What is it?

22:09.402 --> 22:11.470
Two detectives are here
questioning Dr. Arden.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.707
I don't know about what.

22:14.775 --> 22:15.775
Sister...

22:15.843 --> 22:17.977
see to it that these two are secured

22:18.044 --> 22:20.760
till the paperwork for
the procedure is approved.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.148
I'll take 'em to solitary.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.651
Frank... why don't you take
Grace, and I'll take Kit.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.553
Would that be all right, Sister Jude?

22:26.621 --> 22:28.104
Just make sure they're kept apart.

22:28.224 --> 22:29.923
Come on.
Let's go, get up.

22:29.991 --> 22:31.859
Let's go.

22:40.470 --> 22:42.077
It's good advice, Kit.

22:45.696 --> 22:48.477
She's not the innocent girl
she claims to be.

22:54.309 --> 22:58.053
Dr. Arden, I'd like
to go over with... oh.

22:59.322 --> 23:00.756
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

23:00.824 --> 23:02.691
I wasn't aware you had visitors.

23:02.759 --> 23:04.694
I'm Sister Jude.

23:04.761 --> 23:06.261
I run this facility.

23:06.329 --> 23:08.664
Detective Byers.
This is Detective Connors.

23:08.732 --> 23:10.432
Detectives.
My gracious.

23:10.552 --> 23:13.102
This really doesn't
concern you, Sister.

23:13.170 --> 23:14.971
Two police detectives questioning

23:15.039 --> 23:16.873
one of my most valued staff members

23:16.941 --> 23:19.375
concerns me greatly.
Maybe the sister can help.

23:19.443 --> 23:22.078
A nun would make one
hell of a character witness.

23:22.145 --> 23:24.946
If it's a question of the doctor's
character, I've got lots to say.

23:25.066 --> 23:26.233
Well, your colleague here

23:26.301 --> 23:27.868
has been accused of roughing up

23:27.935 --> 23:29.136
a certain lady of the evening.

23:30.538 --> 23:31.632
A prostitute?!

23:31.763 --> 23:34.765
No need to retire to your
fainting couch, Sister.

23:34.833 --> 23:37.301
Because all of this
is an egregious lie.

23:37.369 --> 23:39.737
I've never even met the woman.

23:39.804 --> 23:43.407
It must have been frightening,
meeting strange men,

23:43.475 --> 23:45.651
what with a killer on the loose.

23:45.771 --> 23:48.445
She says she saw some things
which alarmed her.

23:48.513 --> 23:49.493
<i>Obscene material,</i>

23:49.613 --> 23:51.382
<i>pornography...</i>

23:53.740 --> 23:55.452
<i>...Nazi memorabilia.</i>

23:55.520 --> 23:57.254
When she tried to leave his home,

23:57.321 --> 23:58.655
he got physical with her.

23:58.722 --> 24:00.956
No!

24:01.024 --> 24:05.562
This is utter hogwash.
I was here.

24:05.629 --> 24:07.163
Can you verify that for us, Sister?

24:07.231 --> 24:08.855
Did you say Nazi memorabilia?

24:08.975 --> 24:10.360
This is outrageous.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.737
I have no idea what
I'm even being accused of.

24:13.804 --> 24:14.971
One would think that

24:15.039 --> 24:16.983
the Wausaukee County Police Department

24:17.103 --> 24:19.543
would have something
better to do with its time.

24:19.610 --> 24:20.877
I know I have.

24:21.819 --> 24:23.365
Good day to you.

24:25.249 --> 24:27.350
Aren't you going to arrest him?

24:27.418 --> 24:30.928
For what?
Well, you're the Vice detectives.

24:31.150 --> 24:33.256
Actually, Sister, we're Homicide.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.458
Homicide?

24:35.526 --> 24:38.895
Certain details of the victim's
statement caught our eye.

24:38.963 --> 24:40.363
Maybe we can ask you a question.

24:40.431 --> 24:41.698
It's about one of your patients here,

24:41.766 --> 24:43.418
Kit Walker.
What about him?

24:43.538 --> 24:44.901
He seemed like the kind of guy

24:44.969 --> 24:47.377
that would have the surgical
skill to remove a woman's skin?

24:49.173 --> 24:50.340
And her head?

25:10.161 --> 25:12.062
What is this stuff?
Apomorphine.

25:12.130 --> 25:14.164
The standard drug

25:14.232 --> 25:15.766
for this kind of cutting-edge
aversion therapy.

25:15.834 --> 25:18.033
They use it at Harvard,
Brigham Young, Cornell.

25:18.153 --> 25:20.170
The theory is that we're
training your body

25:20.238 --> 25:22.473
to be physically repelled
by certain...

25:23.449 --> 25:24.761
triggers.

25:36.021 --> 25:38.689
How did you get that?

25:38.757 --> 25:41.425
From your house, when I was there.

25:41.493 --> 25:43.325
I thought you might want it.

25:46.030 --> 25:47.230
Say when.

26:02.412 --> 26:03.979
I need a few more minutes...

26:04.047 --> 26:06.682
I need a few minutes
before the next one.

26:06.750 --> 26:10.252
I'm very impressed with
your determination, Lana.

26:10.475 --> 26:12.588
Let's take a break from that.

26:14.912 --> 26:16.459
Let's move on to the conversion part

26:16.526 --> 26:17.640
of your therapy.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.528
I think you might
actually enjoy this part.

26:29.589 --> 26:30.789
You know Daniel.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.375
I've asked him to help out
with your treatment.

26:33.443 --> 26:35.944
He told me that he thinks
you're a very good person,

26:36.012 --> 26:37.312
and he would be honored

26:37.380 --> 26:38.647
to participate

26:38.714 --> 26:39.981
in anything that might liberate you.

26:41.383 --> 26:43.279
Whatever you say, Doctor.

26:43.399 --> 26:45.153
I want to do whatever works.

26:45.221 --> 26:47.455
Good.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.022
Let's get started, then.
Daniel...

26:49.455 --> 26:50.425
We'll begin with

26:50.493 --> 26:51.927
very simple visual stimulation.

26:51.995 --> 26:53.589
Daniel will take off his robe,

26:53.709 --> 26:55.965
and you will regard his physique.

27:08.812 --> 27:10.579
I'm sorry, but...

27:10.647 --> 27:13.215
I don't feel anything.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.551
That's okay.

27:15.619 --> 27:17.586
You're not gonna make
him touch me, are you?

27:17.654 --> 27:20.122
Actually, I'm going to ask you...

27:20.190 --> 27:21.857
to touch yourself.

27:23.827 --> 27:26.161
Can you do that?

27:26.229 --> 27:28.497
I don't know...

27:42.277 --> 27:45.312
Try to focus on his genitals.

27:51.119 --> 27:53.220
Good.

27:55.323 --> 27:56.590
Good, Lana.

27:56.658 --> 27:58.226
Now, take your other hand

27:58.294 --> 27:59.828
and place it on Daniel's member.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.473
Good.

28:15.177 --> 28:17.145
Good. Now keep
touching yourself

28:17.212 --> 28:21.148
and try to relate the
pleasure that you're feeling

28:21.268 --> 28:22.650
to his tumescence.

28:27.719 --> 28:29.124
You're doing good work, Lana.

28:30.326 --> 28:31.717
We're all rooting for you.

28:33.563 --> 28:35.196
Oh!

28:38.434 --> 28:41.169
Give me a few minutes!
Please just

28:41.237 --> 28:42.437
give me a few more seconds!

28:42.505 --> 28:43.939
I know I can do it!

28:44.006 --> 28:45.407
In a perfect world,

28:45.475 --> 28:47.909
I would love to dive
into talk therapy,

28:47.977 --> 28:49.878
discover the root of your fixation,

28:49.946 --> 28:53.448
but my expertise is telling me
that aversion/conversion therapy

28:53.516 --> 28:54.449
won't work with you.

28:57.504 --> 28:59.887
Sister Jude, we need to talk.

29:00.987 --> 29:02.490
Yes, I agree.

29:02.558 --> 29:05.181
The police came
to Briarcliff last night.

29:05.762 --> 29:10.067
It seems
Dr. Arden solicited a...

29:10.834 --> 29:12.660
a woman of the night.

29:12.780 --> 29:17.573
The young woman found
Nazi souvenirs in his bedroom.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.324
Are the police pursuing
a case against him?

29:21.011 --> 29:23.245
No, I don't believe so, but...

29:23.313 --> 29:29.084
Sister, this obsession with
Dr. Arden has to stop.

29:29.152 --> 29:32.055
But there's mounting evidence
that this man is a war criminal.

29:32.175 --> 29:32.988
Just a moment.

29:33.496 --> 29:35.730
Where are you getting
this information?

29:35.798 --> 29:39.834
There is a patient who
survived the death camps.

29:39.901 --> 29:41.669
She remembers him.

29:41.737 --> 29:43.270
Which patient is this?

29:43.338 --> 29:45.110
Her name is Anne.

29:45.230 --> 29:46.520
Anne who?

29:48.544 --> 29:49.878
Anne Frank.

29:49.945 --> 29:53.115
I know it... I know how
it sounds, but you...

29:53.183 --> 29:54.917
No, I really don't think you do.

29:54.985 --> 29:56.686
I saw a prison tattoo.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.290
She was in Auschwitz.

29:58.410 --> 30:00.322
Where's she now, hiding in the attic?

30:00.390 --> 30:02.666
You're so eager
to believe any calumny,

30:02.786 --> 30:05.394
any vile thing said
about this man you despise

30:05.462 --> 30:08.810
that you're taking the word of
an inmate in a mental ward.

30:08.930 --> 30:11.333
Father, this isn't about me.

30:11.401 --> 30:16.267
I am trying to protect you,
this institution, our dream!

30:16.387 --> 30:17.478
You imperil the dream, Sister,

30:17.598 --> 30:19.519
by refusing to face your own failures.

30:19.742 --> 30:22.378
You'd rather see Nazi war
criminals in our midst

30:22.445 --> 30:23.846
than look in the mirror.

30:23.914 --> 30:26.582
Or maybe this job is too much for you.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.851
No, this job means everything to me.

30:28.919 --> 30:30.116
You know that.

30:30.236 --> 30:33.456
All I know is that you've
been drinking again.

30:37.961 --> 30:43.052
Several of our employees witnessed
you were a drunken fool

30:43.172 --> 30:44.746
on the night of the escape,

30:45.353 --> 30:49.606
slurring your words, almost slobbering

30:49.673 --> 30:54.778
during the introduction of the
film from your movie night.

30:54.845 --> 30:58.348
Do you think alcohol has compromised

30:58.415 --> 31:00.175
your judgment in these matters?

31:00.295 --> 31:02.185
You don't need to answer now.

31:02.253 --> 31:03.787
Reflect.

31:07.122 --> 31:08.384
Pray on it.

31:22.139 --> 31:24.107
Hello.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.137
They're on to you, Arthur.

31:26.257 --> 31:28.945
If you have any housekeeping
to take care of,

31:29.012 --> 31:31.514
I suggest you do it now.

31:48.524 --> 31:51.328
Mother Superior, I have slipped.

31:51.448 --> 31:52.618
Oh, dear.

31:53.491 --> 31:57.389
Pressures had mounted all around me,

31:57.457 --> 32:00.326
and then this
God-forsaken storm.

32:01.826 --> 32:03.829
And somehow there was a carafe

32:03.897 --> 32:06.910
of communion wine left in my office.

32:07.220 --> 32:10.358
That's how God is.
He loves to test us.

32:10.670 --> 32:12.204
Well, I failed.

32:12.272 --> 32:14.140
And now he's giving
you another opportunity.

32:14.207 --> 32:16.475
God loves to see us triumph.

32:16.543 --> 32:18.244
It gives Him pleasure.

32:19.085 --> 32:21.618
Was your alcoholic
transgression the only reason

32:21.738 --> 32:23.449
you sought my counsel today, my child?

32:24.518 --> 32:26.019
No, Mother.

32:28.356 --> 32:30.950
There's an employee of Briarcliff

32:31.383 --> 32:33.226
who I believe is a sadist

32:33.294 --> 32:36.229
and possibly a war criminal.

32:36.297 --> 32:39.114
Have you brought this to the
attention of your monsignor?

32:39.893 --> 32:43.536
He has declined to pursue
justice or action.

32:43.604 --> 32:45.471
The men of our church--

32:45.539 --> 32:49.342
your Monsignor Timothy,
even the Holy Father himself,

32:49.409 --> 32:51.243
by their very nature
they react out of fear

32:51.311 --> 32:52.978
when confronted with tough questions.

32:53.046 --> 32:54.613
It's their instinct
to protect themselves,

32:54.681 --> 32:56.415
cover their mistakes.

32:56.483 --> 32:59.317
Now, I'm familiar with
somebody who may help you.

32:59.385 --> 33:05.557
Oh, no, Mother, I cannot,
I will not go behind the back

33:05.625 --> 33:07.091
of the man who gave me
my mission in life;

33:07.159 --> 33:08.428
who believed in me;

33:08.548 --> 33:10.528
with whom I share a dream.

33:11.202 --> 33:14.038
He is not who made you
who you are, Jude.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.959
You came to me a tortured woman,

33:16.027 --> 33:17.861
ravaged by alcohol and guilt,

33:17.929 --> 33:19.329
but you had a compass.

33:19.397 --> 33:20.453
That was your gift.

33:20.573 --> 33:22.750
And God gave you that
gift for a purpose.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.894
Now he's put obstacles in your path,

33:25.203 --> 33:28.000
and like all this debris
after the storm,

33:28.120 --> 33:31.141
it's up to you to make
clear that path again.

34:03.172 --> 34:05.006
Kit?

34:05.074 --> 34:07.175
Kit, are you all right?

34:07.243 --> 34:09.344
Did they...
Cut my balls off?

34:10.409 --> 34:11.579
Not yet.

34:13.248 --> 34:15.349
I was so worried.

34:15.417 --> 34:17.918
You are the only person I ever
had a second thought about

34:17.985 --> 34:19.219
in this hellhole.

34:19.288 --> 34:20.788
Why'd you lie to me, Grace?

34:20.856 --> 34:22.871
There was no man named Red.

34:23.155 --> 34:25.960
You killed your stepmother
and then your father.

34:26.027 --> 34:27.360
What do you want?

34:27.429 --> 34:28.929
You want to hear me

34:28.996 --> 34:29.981
say I'm sorry for what I've done?

34:30.101 --> 34:30.896
I'm not sorry.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.268
Tell me the truth!

34:44.746 --> 34:46.848
I was so young when it started.

34:48.751 --> 34:52.621
My father would come
into my room at night...

34:52.688 --> 34:53.989
and do things.

34:58.983 --> 35:01.399
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>I was in a dream,</i>

35:01.757 --> 35:04.863
<i>watching him do it to a stranger,</i>

35:05.735 --> 35:08.037
<i>or a corpse.</i>

35:09.827 --> 35:12.975
<i>I finally got the courage</i>
<i>to tell my stepmother.</i>

35:14.511 --> 35:16.912
<i>She gave me candy to keep quiet.</i>

35:36.447 --> 35:39.299
There was truth to the story
I told before, Kit.

35:39.366 --> 35:41.837
I loved my horses.

35:41.957 --> 35:44.504
They were my escape.

35:47.508 --> 35:50.544
I found out he sold them all.

35:58.687 --> 35:59.620
Patsy...

36:07.728 --> 36:08.895
That's when I woke up

36:08.963 --> 36:11.098
and saw my life for what it was.

36:11.165 --> 36:15.369
And once I opened my eyes,
there was no turning back.

36:26.748 --> 36:29.016
Have I opened your eyes, Kit?

36:29.084 --> 36:31.819
Are you repulsed by what I am?

36:31.887 --> 36:33.254
No.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.924
I admire you.

37:06.523 --> 37:07.757
I want to talk to you.

37:07.825 --> 37:08.976
I haven't been able to sleep

37:09.096 --> 37:11.194
since you left my office.

37:12.262 --> 37:13.496
I'm so sorry, Lana.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.856
I wish I had been a real help.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.146
I'm not an aversion therapy advocate,

37:18.266 --> 37:21.871
but I thought it made
sense in the moment.

37:21.939 --> 37:23.339
Now I wish I'd spared you.

37:24.294 --> 37:25.942
You tried.

37:30.347 --> 37:31.981
I brought you this.

37:35.853 --> 37:37.387
Thought you'd want it.

37:37.455 --> 37:39.622
They'll never let me keep this.

37:41.094 --> 37:43.717
You only have to hide it
until the end of the week.

37:45.288 --> 37:47.541
I'm leaving here on Friday
and I am taking you with me.

37:47.661 --> 37:49.865
I don't know how yet, but...

37:49.933 --> 37:52.743
I will not leave you
in this place, Lana.

37:52.965 --> 37:54.637
That's a promise.

38:02.768 --> 38:05.347
<i>I understand</i>
<i>you want to confess.</i>

38:07.378 --> 38:09.680
I can only regard this as a ploy,

38:09.748 --> 38:11.315
considering the circumstances.

38:11.382 --> 38:13.650
You were, after all,
caught in the act.

38:13.718 --> 38:18.349
No, uh, Sister, this is, uh,
this is not about Grace and me.

38:18.469 --> 38:19.920
This is about my crimes.

38:21.625 --> 38:23.493
Your crimes.

38:23.561 --> 38:25.162
Yeah.

38:25.229 --> 38:26.897
And I know I'm not
a very religious man,

38:27.420 --> 38:29.721
but I did go to Sunday School,

38:29.788 --> 38:32.156
and I was taught
that God sees everything.

38:32.224 --> 38:33.691
Is that true?

38:33.759 --> 38:35.693
It is. And He does.

38:35.761 --> 38:37.295
Even if I might not remember

38:37.363 --> 38:39.998
some terrible act
that I might have committed?

38:40.065 --> 38:41.132
He knows, right?

38:46.071 --> 38:46.971
God knows all.

38:47.039 --> 38:48.806
Well, then He knows...

38:48.874 --> 38:50.675
if I murdered those women.

38:50.742 --> 38:54.546
He knows if I... if I did
those horrible things.

38:55.212 --> 38:59.251
And He knows if I killed Alma.

38:59.319 --> 39:00.852
Did you?

39:00.920 --> 39:02.187
I must have.

39:02.255 --> 39:03.822
I mean...

39:05.558 --> 39:08.360
...everyone's saying that I did.

39:09.662 --> 39:10.962
And those creatures, the creatures,

39:11.030 --> 39:12.263
they can't really exist.

39:12.331 --> 39:14.833
I remember when
I first showed up here,

39:14.901 --> 39:17.169
you said to me that,
in order to find forgiveness,

39:17.237 --> 39:19.339
that I had to...

39:19.406 --> 39:21.975
that I had to... that I had
to admit to what I'd done.

39:22.042 --> 39:23.710
Sister...

39:23.778 --> 39:26.914
I need to be forgiven.

39:28.884 --> 39:30.351
God forgives all who seek Him.

39:30.419 --> 39:31.419
Then help me.

39:31.487 --> 39:32.757
Please.

39:32.877 --> 39:34.589
Help me find God.

39:34.709 --> 39:37.491
I'll admit to everything that I've done.
My child...

39:38.968 --> 39:42.530
...we're all sinners,
every one of us.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.765
But the things I've done, Sister...

39:44.833 --> 39:46.433
That you can't recall.

39:54.875 --> 39:58.190
Now, what have you been
saying about me?

39:58.310 --> 40:00.714
The truth.
I know who you are!

40:02.050 --> 40:03.715
You don't even know who you are.

40:03.782 --> 40:06.918
Anne Frank?! She died!

40:06.985 --> 40:08.853
Or didn't you bother to read the book?

40:10.722 --> 40:13.624
Your lies have caused me
a great deal of embarrassment.

40:13.692 --> 40:15.412
What are you going to do to me?

40:15.532 --> 40:18.761
The same things you did to
those girls in Auschwitz? Huh?

40:18.881 --> 40:22.237
I was never in Auschwitz.
I'm from Scottsdale!

40:22.357 --> 40:25.302
Liar! I bet it looked
a lot like this place!

40:25.370 --> 40:26.570
You want to know what goes on in here?

40:28.339 --> 40:29.372
You're about to find out.

40:37.616 --> 40:39.434
Where'd you get that?

40:39.554 --> 40:42.053
I'm not the only one who's on to you.

40:43.923 --> 40:46.024
Oh... oh, sorry.

40:47.093 --> 40:49.061
Come on...

40:49.129 --> 40:50.963
now's the time.

40:51.030 --> 40:53.699
Confess, Hans Gruper.

40:54.115 --> 40:55.901
Nazi piece of shit.

40:57.603 --> 40:58.570
What's that?

41:00.673 --> 41:01.773
Bitch!
What is in that room?

41:01.840 --> 41:03.888
Go to hell.
I've been there.

41:05.510 --> 41:07.110
Give me the key.

41:07.178 --> 41:08.778
Give me the key!

41:08.898 --> 41:10.881
Want to lose another leg?

41:20.091 --> 41:21.992
Kill me.
