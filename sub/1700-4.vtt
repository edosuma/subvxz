WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.252
Oh, that's good.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.254
- Okay. All right, Phoebe?
- Okay, okay.

00:05.422 --> 00:09.883
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace...

00:10.093 --> 00:13.178
...no more hunger,
good things for the rain forest.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.556
And bigger boobs.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.852
Well, see, you took mine, so...

00:21.062 --> 00:22.438
Chandler, what about you?

00:22.605 --> 00:26.025
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.527
Heh. See, there's always one guy.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.405
"If I had a wish,
I'd wish for three more wishes."

00:34.075 --> 00:35.534
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, buddy.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.828
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?

00:38.538 --> 00:40.831
Probably kill myself.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.250
Excuse me?

00:43.418 --> 00:47.087
Hey, if Little Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to live, you know?

00:49.090 --> 00:51.383
Joey, uh, omnipotent.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.054
You are?

00:55.221 --> 00:56.930
Ross, I'm...

01:49.275 --> 01:51.485
How does she do that?

01:51.653 --> 01:54.822
I cannot sleep in a public place.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.323
Would you look at her?

01:56.491 --> 01:59.660
- She's so peaceful.
- Yeah.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.622
What? What? Hi.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.958
It's okay, you know.
You just nodded off again.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.127
- Oh.
- What's going on with you?

02:08.294 --> 02:09.919
- I got no sleep last night.
- Why?

02:10.088 --> 02:13.090
My grandmother
has this new boyfriend...

02:13.883 --> 02:17.177
...and they're both kind of insecure
in bed, so...

02:17.345 --> 02:18.887
And deaf.

02:20.682 --> 02:24.726
So they're constantly having to reassure
each other that they're having a good time.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.937
You have no idea how loud they are.

02:29.023 --> 02:32.109
- You can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
- Thanks.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.278
Ninety-five, 96, 97.

02:34.445 --> 02:38.657
See, I told you.
Less than 100 steps from our place to here.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.660
You got way too much free time, man.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.913
Hey, there's the birthday boy.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.915
Ross, check it out. Hockey tickets.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.710
Rangers-Penguins tonight at the Garden.
We're taking you.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.879
- Happy birthday, pal.
- We love you, man.

02:54.299 --> 02:57.217
It's funny,
my birthday was seven months ago.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.095
- So?
- So I'm guessing you had an extra ticket...

03:00.263 --> 03:03.557
...and couldn't decide
which one of you got to bring a date? Huh?

03:04.142 --> 03:06.977
Well, aren't we
Mr. The-Glass-is-Half-Empty?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.688
Oh, my God. Oh.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.857
Is today the 20th? October 20th?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.568
- I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
- Oh.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.153
What's wrong with the 20th?

03:16.321 --> 03:19.698
Eleven days before Halloween?
All the good costumes are gone?

03:20.992 --> 03:23.118
Today's the day Carol and I...

03:23.286 --> 03:26.830
...first consummated...

03:26.998 --> 03:29.791
...our physical relationship.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.461
We had sex.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.715
You know what?
I better pass on the game.

03:36.883 --> 03:41.970
I think I'm just gonna go home and think
about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.807
The hell with hockey. Let's all do that.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.978
Come on, Ross. You, me, Joey, ice?

03:50.146 --> 03:52.397
Guys' night out?
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

03:52.565 --> 03:54.191
Huh? Huh? Huh?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.777
- What are you doing?
- I have no idea.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.195
Come on, Ross.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.156
All right, all right.
Maybe it will take my mind off it.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.825
- You promise to buy me a big foam finger?
- You got it.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.912
- All right.
- Look, look, look. My first paycheck.

04:08.289 --> 04:12.626
Look at the window.
There's my name. Hi, me.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.837
I remember the day
I got my first paycheck.

04:16.005 --> 04:19.423
There was a cave-in in one of the mines,
and eight people were killed.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.970
Wow, you worked in a mine?

04:23.137 --> 04:25.806
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

04:29.227 --> 04:31.895
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.523
I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk for it.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.025
And it was totally...

04:37.193 --> 04:39.486
...not worth it.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.364
Who's FICA?
Why's he getting all my money?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.660
I mean, what...? Chandler, look at that.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.372
Oh, this is not that bad.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.624
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.

04:53.584 --> 04:58.922
- You can totally, totally live on this.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.382
By the way, great service today.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.675
- Ooh.
- Oh, yeah.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.302
- Terrific.
- It was excellent.

05:03.511 --> 05:06.471
Unbelievable.
And all that milk and stuff? Great.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.224
- Hockey.
- Hockey. Hockey.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.529
- Hockey.
- Hockey. Hockey. Hockey.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.615
Rachel?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.035
Oh, my God!

05:34.167 --> 05:37.085
I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.255
What are you guys doing here?

05:40.423 --> 05:43.633
Well, we were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here...

05:43.801 --> 05:46.136
...and it's true.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.013
Yeah.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.475
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.023
God, look at you. You are so big.
I can't believe it.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.734
I know, I know. I'm a duplex.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.695
So, what's going on with you?

06:03.863 --> 06:07.491
Well, guess who my dad's making partner
in his firm.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.455
And while we're on the subject
of news...

06:16.667 --> 06:17.959
Look, look. I have elbows.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.718
Passes it up to Leetch.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.887
Leetch spots Messier in the crease.
Here's the pass.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.889
Oh. Oh.

06:31.557 --> 06:35.268
We'll take a time-out while Messier stops
to look at some women's shoes.

06:36.020 --> 06:41.024
Carol was wearing boots just like those
the night that we first...

06:41.192 --> 06:42.651
...you know.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.403
In fact, she, uh...

06:44.570 --> 06:46.696
She never took them off. Ha, ha.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.366
It's because we... Sorry. Sorry.

06:50.743 --> 06:51.827
I can't believe...

06:55.123 --> 06:57.082
- What?
- Peach pit.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.583
Yes, bunny?

07:00.128 --> 07:01.336
Peach pit.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.339
- That night, we, uh, had...
- Peaches?

07:04.507 --> 07:06.967
Actually, nectarines, but basically.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.138
- Could've been a peach.
- Then we, uh...

07:11.305 --> 07:15.475
Then we got dressed
and I walked her to...

07:15.643 --> 07:17.811
...the bus stop.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.313
I'm fine.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.607
Hey, that woman's got an ass
like Carol's.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.282
What?
I thought we were trying to find stuff.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.119
Oh, come on, you guys.
Tell me all the dirt.

07:34.287 --> 07:38.123
Well, the biggest news
is still you dumping Barry at the altar.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.004
- All right, let's talk reality for a second.
- Okay.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.506
- When are you coming home?
- What?

07:46.674 --> 07:47.799
Guys, I'm not.

07:47.967 --> 07:52.637
- Heh. Come on. This is us.
- I'm not.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.308
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.143
Waitressing?

07:58.311 --> 08:01.062
Heh. I'm not just waitressing.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.690
I mean, I'm...

08:03.858 --> 08:05.525
I, um...

08:06.110 --> 08:09.654
I write the specials
on the specials board.

08:09.822 --> 08:13.992
And I take the dead flowers
out of the vase.

08:14.202 --> 08:19.080
Um, oh, and sometimes Arturo lets me put
the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.083
Well, your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.347
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?

08:39.602 --> 08:43.020
Okay, how would you like
some Tiki Death Punch?

08:43.188 --> 08:44.231
What's that?

08:44.398 --> 08:47.359
- Well, it's rum and...
- Okay.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.198
We thought since Phoebe's staying over
we'd have a slumber party.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.951
We got some trashy magazines,
we got cookie dough, we got Twister.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.871
Ooh, ooh. And I brought Operation.

09:00.039 --> 09:04.000
But I lost the tweezers,
so we can't operate.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.003
But we can prep the guy.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.258
Rach, it's the Visa-card people.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.718
Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

09:13.886 --> 09:17.222
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?

09:18.099 --> 09:19.140
Yes, hold on.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.893
Um, they say there's been unusual activity
on your account.

09:22.061 --> 09:26.314
- But I haven't used my card in weeks.
- That is the unusual activity.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.652
They just wanna see if you're okay.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.779
They wanna know if I'm okay?

09:32.947 --> 09:35.282
Okay, they wanna know if I'm okay.
Okay, let's see.

09:35.449 --> 09:38.868
Well, let's see.
The FICA guys took all my money.

09:39.036 --> 09:42.914
Everyone I know is either getting married
or getting pregnant or getting promoted...

09:43.082 --> 09:44.583
...and I'm getting coffee.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.876
And it's not even for me.

09:47.044 --> 09:50.630
So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay,
then you can tell them I'm okay. Okay?

09:53.509 --> 09:56.845
Uh, Rachel has left the building.

09:57.888 --> 10:01.516
- Can you call back?
- All right. Come on.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.603
Let's play Twister.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.114
- Sorry.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.657
Uh-oh.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.577
What? There was ice there
that night with Carol?

10:20.745 --> 10:24.831
Plastic seats?
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

10:25.750 --> 10:29.210
No, actually, I was just saying
it looks like we're not sitting together.

10:29.378 --> 10:33.131
But now that you mention it,
there was ice there that night.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.259
It was the first frost.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.346
- We were...
- Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

10:39.513 --> 10:40.805
You should feel great.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.141
You're doing this amazing
independent thing.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.435
Monica, what is so amazing?

10:45.603 --> 10:50.065
I gave up like everything. And for what?

10:50.232 --> 10:51.775
You are just like Jack.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.735
Jack from downstairs?

10:54.362 --> 10:57.405
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.367
- Ah, the other Jack.
- Yeah, right.

11:00.534 --> 11:04.162
See, he gave up something,
but then he got those magic beans.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.541
And then he woke up
and there was this big plant...

11:08.709 --> 11:12.170
...outside of his window,
full of possibilities and stuff.

11:12.338 --> 11:16.007
And he lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.

11:16.467 --> 11:20.011
Okay, but, Pheebs, Pheebs,
Jack gave up a cow.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.472
I gave up an orthodontist.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.016
Okay, I know I didn't love him, but...

11:25.184 --> 11:27.936
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.314
But, see, it was a plan, you know?
It was clear.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.693
Everything was figured out,
and now everything's just kind of like...

11:34.860 --> 11:36.903
- Flupie?
- Yeah.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.157
You're not the only one.
We don't know where we're going.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.077
You gotta figure, at some point,
it's gonna come together...

11:44.245 --> 11:47.080
...and it's just gonna be "unflupie."

11:47.248 --> 11:48.832
Yeah, like that's a word.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.505
Okay, but, Monica,
what if it doesn't come together?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.300
Pheebs?

12:00.219 --> 12:03.680
Well, because you just...
I don't like this question.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.435
Okay, see? See, you guys?
What if we don't get magic beans?

12:08.602 --> 12:11.271
I mean, what if all we've got are...

12:11.439 --> 12:13.356
...beans?

12:16.944 --> 12:20.196
Get him! Get him! Get him!

12:20.364 --> 12:23.575
Get... Yes!
You're not laughing now, are you, pal?

12:23.743 --> 12:27.370
That's all you need, a bunch of toothless
guys hitting each other with sticks.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.831
Pass it. Pass it.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.877
He's open, he's open.
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!

12:36.547 --> 12:38.548
- Whoa. Oh.
- Whoa.

12:39.842 --> 12:43.178
- Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

12:43.345 --> 12:46.014
- I got it!
- Hey, hey, we got it! Hey!

12:57.109 --> 12:58.777
Excuse me.

12:58.944 --> 13:03.281
It says to call this number if you're not
completely satisfied with this candy bar.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.413
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.665
Listen, it's kind of an emergency.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.293
I guess you'd know that,
or we'd be in the predicament room.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.633
Hold on. Fill these out. Sit over there.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.010
Look, I don't wanna
make any trouble, okay?

13:24.178 --> 13:28.473
But I'm in a lot of pain here, all right?
My face is dented.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.894
- Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
- Well, how long do you think it'll be?

13:33.312 --> 13:34.896
Any minute now.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.151
Hey, listen... Ooh.

13:43.739 --> 13:48.827
I wake up and I start to cry

13:48.994 --> 13:50.954
Ain't no hope in...

13:51.121 --> 13:56.209
Oh. I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.753
No, you were right.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.714
I don't have a plan.

14:03.884 --> 14:04.926
Pizza guy.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.011
- Thank God.
- Food.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.389
- Phoebe?
- What?

14:09.557 --> 14:13.810
- Do you have a plan?
- I don't even have a "pla."

14:16.355 --> 14:18.606
Hi. One mushroom,
green pepper and onion?

14:19.149 --> 14:22.819
No, no, no. That's not what we ordered.

14:22.987 --> 14:27.115
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.328
- Wait, you're not G. Stephanopoulos?
- No.

14:32.496 --> 14:35.623
- Oh, man. My dad's gonna kill me.
- Wait.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.127
Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?

14:39.295 --> 14:41.921
Yeah, this one goes across the street.
I must have given him yours.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.382
Oh, bonehead. Bonehead.

14:45.009 --> 14:49.888
Wait, was this a small Mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks?

14:50.806 --> 14:52.265
Yeah, that sounds about right.

14:52.433 --> 14:56.477
- Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
- And a power tie?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.105
No, pretty much just a towel.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.149
- Oh, God.
- Oh. Oh.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.443
- Oh, my God.
- You want me to take this back?

15:03.611 --> 15:07.447
What? Are you nuts?
We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.533
Here.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.703
- Uh, Pheebs?
- Yeah?

15:13.871 --> 15:15.330
Who's George Snuffleupagus?

15:18.042 --> 15:19.417
That's Big Bird's friend.

15:22.713 --> 15:23.755
I see pizza.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.049
Oh, I wanna see. Let me see. Let me see.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.259
Hello? Who are we spying on?

15:28.427 --> 15:31.638
You know the White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy?

15:31.805 --> 15:35.224
The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, really cute butt?

15:35.392 --> 15:39.395
Oh, him. The little guy. Oh, I love him.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.732
Ooh. Oh, wait. Wait, I see a woman.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.984
Tell me it's his mother.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.820
- Definitely not his mother.
- Oh, no.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.073
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.992
She's walking, she's walking.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.746
She's going for the pizza.
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!

16:01.835 --> 16:04.921
Dr. Max to Center 456.

16:05.089 --> 16:08.841
Dr. Max to Center 456.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.097
Excuse me.
We've been here for over an hour...

16:14.264 --> 16:16.683
...and people less sick than my friend
have gone in.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.936
I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
Who's he sleeping with?

16:23.273 --> 16:26.025
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.736
I know we both said some things...

16:30.030 --> 16:31.406
...we didn't mean...

16:31.573 --> 16:34.867
...but that doesn't mean
we still don't love each other.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.996
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.918
- Lights still out?
- Yeah.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.004
Well, maybe they're napping.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.965
Heh. Please. They're having sex.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.633
Shut up.

16:55.931 --> 16:59.267
So, what do you think George is like?

16:59.435 --> 17:01.811
- I think he's shy.
- Oh, yeah?

17:01.979 --> 17:04.605
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.

17:04.772 --> 17:08.734
And then when you do,
he's a preppy animal.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.364
Come on.

17:13.615 --> 17:16.867
I remember the moonlight coming in
through the open window...

17:17.036 --> 17:20.538
...and her face
had the most incredible glow.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.915
Yes, the moon, the glow,
the magical feeling.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.126
You did this part.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.337
Could I get some painkillers over here,
please?

17:29.006 --> 17:32.759
He's right, enough already.
What is the big deal about today?

17:32.926 --> 17:35.595
So you slept with her for the first time.
So what?

17:35.763 --> 17:38.181
You slept with her
for seven years after that.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.809
It's just a little more complicated
than that.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.771
What? What is it? That she left you?
That she likes women?

17:44.938 --> 17:47.106
That she left you for a woman
that likes women?

17:47.274 --> 17:48.316
A little louder.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.652
There's a man on the 12th floor in a coma
who didn't quite hear you.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.365
Then what?

17:57.493 --> 18:00.161
My first time with Carol was...

18:00.329 --> 18:01.370
Was my...

18:03.624 --> 18:05.041
What?

18:07.586 --> 18:10.379
It was my first...

18:10.547 --> 18:11.964
...time.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.842
With Carol?

18:19.640 --> 18:20.973
Oh.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.519
So in your whole life,
you've only been with one?

18:24.686 --> 18:25.937
Oh.

18:26.814 --> 18:30.817
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

18:31.276 --> 18:34.445
There's a whole bunch of stuff
we could've done tonight.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.241
Okay. Okay, I got one.

18:38.909 --> 18:43.538
Do you remember that vegetarian pâté
that I made that you loved so much?

18:43.705 --> 18:44.747
Uh-huh.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.252
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...

18:49.461 --> 18:52.630
- Oh! Oh!
Ha-ha-ha.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.340
Okay, fine, fine.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.135
Now I don't feel so bad
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

18:57.594 --> 19:01.389
- What? You slept with Jason?
- You had already broken up.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.058
- How long?
- Just a couple hours.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.227
Oh, that's nice.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.855
Okay, okay, okay, I got one.

19:10.858 --> 19:11.899
Anyway.

19:12.067 --> 19:15.778
The valentine Tommy Rollerson left
in your locker was really from me.

19:16.446 --> 19:17.488
Excuse me?

19:18.198 --> 19:21.826
Oh, hello?
Like he was really gonna send you one.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.414
She was a big girl.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.125
Really?

19:29.293 --> 19:34.589
Well, at least big girls don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.550
I was laughing. You made me laugh.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.344
Oh, my God.
There he is. There he is. There he is.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.973
- Where?
- Right where we've been looking all night.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.101
- Oh, he's so cute.
- Oh, George, baby, drop the towel.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.520
- Come on, drop the towel.
- Drop the towel.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.564
Please drop the towel. Drop it.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.399
Wow.

19:56.904 --> 20:01.991
Man, can you believe he's only had sex
with one woman?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.410
I think it's great.

20:04.578 --> 20:09.040
You know, it's sweet. It's romantic.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.083
Really?

20:11.251 --> 20:14.420
No, are you kidding?
The guy's a freak. I judge him.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.880
- Hey, man.
- Hey, buddy.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.882
Ah? Ah?

20:20.427 --> 20:21.719
Oh.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.554
That's attractive.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.683
Oh, I thought you were great
in Silence of the Lambs.

20:31.104 --> 20:34.398
Oh, come on, admit it,
all things considered, you had fun tonight.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.733
Fun? Where was the fun?

20:35.901 --> 20:38.486
Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part?

20:38.654 --> 20:39.904
Where's my puck?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.865
- Oh. The kid has it.
- The kid?

20:43.700 --> 20:46.786
Ahem. Excuse me, uh, that's my puck.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.539
I found it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.087
You gotta do it, man.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.966
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue.
Whatever you...

21:00.133 --> 21:02.218
I can't do it.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.513
- Listen, uh, give me back my puck.
- No.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.722
- Yes, how about?
- No.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.849
- No, come here. Just give me my puck.
- No, no, no.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.977
Hey, no roughhousing in my ER.

21:11.144 --> 21:12.770
Give me my puck! Unh.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.736
Now, that was fun.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.035
Okay, Monica.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.746
Right foot, red.

21:30.956 --> 21:34.375
Could've played Monopoly, but no.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.216
Thanks.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.142
Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.

21:53.854 --> 21:56.188
- Good.
- Hmm?

22:00.986 --> 22:02.486
Hello?

22:03.030 --> 22:06.907
- Oh. Rachel, it's the Visa-card people.
- Oh, okay. Will you take my place?

22:07.075 --> 22:08.993
All right. Yes, this is Rachel.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.661
- No.
- Oh.

22:12.914 --> 22:13.956
Hello?

22:14.166 --> 22:18.044
Oh, yeah. No, I know.
I haven't been using it much.

22:18.211 --> 22:21.756
Oh, well, thanks, but I'm okay, really.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.299
To the green, to the green.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.675
- Oh, no.
- To the green.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.178
I've got magic beans.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.973
No, no, never mind.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.558
To the left. To the left.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.396
I'm fine.
