00:03.904 --> 00:06.207
ATLANTA...

00:06.207 --> 00:07.908
YOU'RE LISTENING TO V-103.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.677
THIS IS ZINO AFTER DARK.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.279
HOW DO YOU WORK THE BUSINESS OUT

00:11.279 --> 00:12.446
WITH THE RELATIONSHIP?

00:12.446 --> 00:13.181
I LOVE STEVIE.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.282
I APPRECIATE HIM.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.083
BUT I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE

00:15.083 --> 00:17.618
WITH HIM.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.386
YOU TREAT ME LIKE I'M A

00:18.386 --> 00:19.153
PROSTITUTE.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.221
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:20.221 --> 00:21.989
I DON'T PAY TO [bleep] YOU.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.191
AND I KNOW YOU LOVE SCRAPPY.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.625
I KNOW HE LOVES YOU.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.659
BUT DOES HE LOVES YOU ENOUGH

00:25.659 --> 00:27.761
TO REALLY MARRY YOU?

00:27.761 --> 00:28.962
IF YOU MY MAMA

00:28.962 --> 00:30.030
AND I'M YOUR SON,

00:30.030 --> 00:31.899
AND I'M GOING TO THE LEFT,

00:31.899 --> 00:33.401
I THINK YOU SHOULD FOLLOW ME.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.202
I'LL DO THAT,

00:34.202 --> 00:36.036
BUT THEN I LIKE SHAY,

00:36.036 --> 00:38.206
AND SHE LOST A LITTLE MORE

00:38.206 --> 00:40.908
WEIGHT, AND SHE LOOKING "FOIN."

00:43.844 --> 00:44.745
I JUST WANT TO GET

00:44.745 --> 00:46.013
LITTLE PIGGY AND THE BEAR

00:46.013 --> 00:47.781
BACK TOGETHER.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.283
WELL, THEN IF THE GORILLA

00:49.283 --> 00:50.484
IS NOT IN THE MIDDLE,

00:50.484 --> 00:53.087
THEN MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.088
IS THAT THE DOOR?

00:54.088 --> 00:55.022
YEAH, THAT'S THE DOOR.

00:55.022 --> 00:55.689
STEVIE, WHAT, YOU GOT

00:55.689 --> 00:56.790

00:56.790 --> 00:57.558

00:59.093 --> 01:00.628

01:00.628 --> 01:01.462

02:36.657 --> 02:37.991

SHE ALWAYS STRESSED OUT.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.095
SHE HAS NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT,

02:42.095 --> 02:43.464
AND SHE'S JUST WASTED 15 YEARS

05:57.791 --> 05:58.826
FROM MY MOM.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.494
I DONE HAD TO GO IN ON MY

06:00.494 --> 06:01.762
MAMA, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

06:01.762 --> 06:04.331
BUT LATELY SHE RESPECT

06:04.331 --> 06:05.265
THE WHOLE MARRIAGE.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.600
SHE TRYING TO LEARN HOW

06:06.600 --> 06:08.168
TO DEAL WITH IT AND GET IT

06:08.168 --> 06:09.336
THROUGH HER THICK SKULL.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.070
YOU FEEL ME?

06:10.070 --> 06:10.771

06:10.771 --> 06:11.805
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

06:11.805 --> 06:12.773
UGH.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.341
SCRAPPY'S NEVER GONNA GET

06:14.341 --> 06:15.543
ANYTHING AS FAR AS THIS

06:15.543 --> 06:16.777
ENGAGEMENT THROUGH HIS MOM'S

06:16.777 --> 06:17.745
THICK SKULL.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.547
BUT MY MOM AND SCRAPPY,

06:19.547 --> 06:21.615
I NEED THEM TO BE ON ONE ACCORD.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.983
NOW, THAT'S A REALISTIC

06:22.983 --> 06:23.951
CONVERSATION.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.018
I JUST KIND OF FEEL LIKE Y'ALL

06:25.018 --> 06:26.019
DO JUST REALLY NEED TO SIT DOWN

06:26.019 --> 06:27.588

06:29.490 --> 06:30.458

06:30.458 --> 06:31.625

06:31.625 --> 06:32.460
MOM.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.062
JUST SIT DOWN AND HAVE A TALK

06:35.062 --> 06:36.229

06:36.229 --> 06:37.130

06:37.130 --> 06:38.766
DAY, IT'S OUR RELATIONSHIP.

06:38.766 --> 06:39.933
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

06:39.933 --> 06:41.769
BUT THOSE ARE OUR PARENTS,

06:41.769 --> 06:43.704
SO I DON'T SEE NO REASON WHY

06:43.704 --> 06:44.572
I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TALK

06:44.572 --> 06:45.473
TO YOUR MOM.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.954
YOUR FAVORITE DJ ON YOUR RADIO

07:36.724 --> 07:37.858
AND I AM ONE OF THE HOTTEST

07:37.858 --> 07:40.127
FEMALE DJs IN ATLANTA.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.595
I LOVE MUSIC,

07:41.595 --> 07:42.596
BUT MY FIRST PRIORITY

07:42.596 --> 07:44.331
IS BEING A GOOD MOM TO MY SON.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.432
YOU NEED TO KEEP IT HERE

07:45.432 --> 07:46.099
FOR ANOTHER HOUR OF

07:46.099 --> 07:47.100
COMMERCIAL-FREE HIP-HOP,

07:47.100 --> 07:48.836
ON 107.9.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.204
HEY, BOO!

07:51.204 --> 07:53.674
HI.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.642
I WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP

07:54.642 --> 07:55.843
WITH DJ BABEYDREW,

07:55.843 --> 07:57.177
CHRIS BROWN'S DJ.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.145
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE,

07:58.145 --> 07:59.079
BUT WE HAVE A SIX-YEAR-OLD

07:59.079 --> 08:01.048
HANDSOME SON LITTLE, DREW.

08:01.048 --> 08:01.915
HE CHEATED ON ME WHEN I WAS

08:01.915 --> 08:02.983
PREGNANT AND I BROKE UP WITH

08:02.983 --> 08:04.351
HIM, BUT WE STILL HAVE TO BE

08:04.351 --> 08:06.186
CIVIL AND CO-PARENT.

08:06.186 --> 08:06.987
DO ME A FAVOR AND GO WITH J.

08:06.987 --> 08:07.655
SOMEWHERE.

08:07.655 --> 08:08.321
YEAH.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.222
OKAY, J., CAN YOU TAKE HIM

08:09.222 --> 08:09.990
OUT?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.091
DREW AND I NEED TO TALK.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.259
THE PROBLEM WITH OUR SITUATION

08:12.259 --> 08:13.827
IS, ONE, DREW IS EITHER

08:13.827 --> 08:15.162
ENTERTAINING SOME GROUPIE CHICK,

08:15.162 --> 08:16.964
TWO, HE'S ON TOUR,

08:16.964 --> 08:18.866
OR THREE, REFER BACK TO ONE.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.100
HE NEEDS TO GET IT TOGETHER

08:20.100 --> 08:20.934
REALLY FAST,

08:20.934 --> 08:22.169
ESPECIALLY SINCE OUR SON NEEDS

08:22.169 --> 08:23.637
HIM IN HIS LIFE.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.471
I GOT YOU A SHIRT.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.573
I SEE YOU GOT A NEW SHIRT.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.239
WHAT'S THIS?

08:26.239 --> 08:27.074
THAT'S MY MOVEMENT.

08:27.074 --> 08:27.875
YOU HAVE TO JOIN MY MOVEMENT,

08:27.875 --> 08:28.576
OKAY?

08:28.576 --> 08:29.276
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

08:29.276 --> 08:30.077
IT'S THE "THA HA."

08:30.077 --> 08:30.744
THE WHO?

08:30.744 --> 08:31.444
THE "THA HA."

08:31.444 --> 08:32.312
OKAY, SO YOU KNOW HOW THERE'S

08:32.312 --> 08:33.581
SUCH THINGS AS GROUPIES, RIGHT?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.214
YOU KNOW THEM.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.148
WE DON'T WANT TO CALL--

08:35.148 --> 08:36.016
WE DON'T WANT TO CALL THEM

08:36.016 --> 08:36.784
GROUPIES.

08:36.784 --> 08:37.918
WE WANT TO CALL THEM

08:37.918 --> 08:38.719
SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T

08:38.719 --> 08:39.987
KNOW WE CALLING THEM GROUPIES.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.855
SO I CAME UP WITH THIS PHRASE:

08:41.855 --> 08:44.257
"THESE HOES ARE HOES ALWAYS."

08:44.257 --> 08:44.958
YOU MADE THAT UP?

08:44.958 --> 08:45.659
I MADE THAT UP.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.459
'CAUSE YOU KNOW THAT VERY

08:46.459 --> 08:47.160
WELL.

08:47.160 --> 08:47.861
I'M ON TOUR, RIGHT?

08:47.861 --> 08:48.796
I'M ON TOUR WITH CHRIS.

08:48.796 --> 08:49.630
THESE GIRLS ARE WAITING

08:49.630 --> 08:50.497
IN THE LOBBY.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.264
THEY COULD BE WAITING AT THE

08:51.264 --> 08:52.065
CLUB, THEY COULD BE WAITING

08:52.065 --> 08:52.833
AT THE BACK OF THE CLUB--

08:52.833 --> 08:53.601
THEY COULD BE WAITING

08:53.601 --> 08:54.735
AT YOUR HOTEL ROOM.

08:54.735 --> 08:55.435
THEY COULD BE WAITING

08:55.435 --> 08:57.070
AT YOUR APARTMENT.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.171
YEAH, BUT I'M JUST SAYING,

08:58.171 --> 08:58.839
LIKE--

08:58.839 --> 08:59.607
YOU GOT HOES EVERYWHERE.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.709
IT'S MY FAULT I'M HANDSOME.

09:01.709 --> 09:02.509
DID YOU JUST SAY THAT

09:02.509 --> 09:03.711
OUT LOUD?

09:03.711 --> 09:05.646
BIG DREW HAS A REVOLVING DOOR

09:05.646 --> 09:06.747
OF WOMEN.

09:06.747 --> 09:07.815
MY SON DOESN'T NEED TO SEE

09:07.815 --> 09:09.282
HIS DADDY WITH ALL OF THESE

09:09.282 --> 09:10.383
WOMEN BECAUSE HE'S GONNA GROW

09:10.383 --> 09:11.218
UP TO BELIEVE THAT,

09:11.218 --> 09:12.185
"I'M GONNA ROTATE WOMEN

09:12.185 --> 09:13.320
LIKE MY DAD DOES."

09:13.320 --> 09:14.187
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TEACHING

09:14.187 --> 09:15.088
MY SON.

09:15.088 --> 09:15.889
SINCE YOU WANT TO POINT OUT

09:15.889 --> 09:17.390
AND GIVE ME SHIRTS ABOUT HOES,

09:17.390 --> 09:18.992
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR HOES.

09:18.992 --> 09:19.860
I DON'T HAVE HOES.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.361
OKAY, FINE, LET'S TALK--

09:21.361 --> 09:23.163
I HAVE FINE, FINE WOMEN.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.632
OH, PLEASE, WOMEN?

09:24.632 --> 09:26.166
OKAY, WHAT IT IS, THE HA?

09:26.166 --> 09:27.434
I WANT YOU TO KEEP THE HAs

09:27.434 --> 09:28.301
WAY FROM MY SON.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.069
THERE'S NO HAs AROUND OUR

09:29.069 --> 09:29.737
SON.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.438
BUT--WHAT IS HAPPENING

09:31.438 --> 09:32.272
RIGHT NOW?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.240
THE LAST "THA HA" YOU HAD

09:33.240 --> 09:34.007
AROUND MY KID--

09:34.007 --> 09:35.375
THE LAST "THA HA" MOVED--

09:35.375 --> 09:36.309
THE LAST "THA HA"--

09:36.309 --> 09:37.645
I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT

09:37.645 --> 09:39.246
THE CHICK, HO, THA HA,

09:39.246 --> 09:40.180
AROUND MY KID,

09:40.180 --> 09:41.248
AND YOU HAD HER AROUND MY SON

09:41.248 --> 09:42.182
ANYWAY.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.784
DREWSY HAS SEEN, WHAT,

09:43.784 --> 09:45.185
EIGHT, NINE CHICKS?

09:45.185 --> 09:46.453
THAT NEEDS TO STOP.

09:46.453 --> 09:47.387
EIGHT, NINE "THE HAs"

09:47.387 --> 09:48.922
NEEDS TO STOP.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.290
THESE BITCHES ARE MICROWAVEABLE

09:50.290 --> 09:50.958
BITCHES.

09:50.958 --> 09:51.992
YOU POP THEM

09:51.992 --> 09:52.726
AND YOU KEEP THEM MOVING.

09:52.726 --> 09:53.827
THEY WANT YOU FOR ONE THING.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.195
YOU CHRIS BROWN DJ,

09:55.195 --> 09:55.929
AND THAT'S WHY THEY WANT

09:55.929 --> 09:56.830
TO [bleep] WITH YOU.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.564
PERIOD!

09:57.564 --> 09:58.465
AND THEN NONE OF THESE BITCHES

09:58.465 --> 09:59.132
HAVE ANYTHING GOING ON

09:59.132 --> 09:59.833
FOR THEMSELVES.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.668
WHY DON'T YOU FIND A BITCH

10:00.668 --> 10:01.301
THAT'S ON MY LEVEL

10:01.301 --> 10:03.203
THAT GOT, LIKE, SIX JOBS?

10:03.203 --> 10:04.471
NO, YOU FIND A CHICK

10:04.471 --> 10:06.139
THAT'S ASPIRING FOR SOMETHING,

10:06.139 --> 10:07.107
BUT DON'T HAVE A [bleep] JOB.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.408
YOU MOVED AT THE HOT HEN,

10:08.408 --> 10:09.677
AND SHE'S AROUND MY KID.

10:09.677 --> 10:12.245
THAT [bleep] NEEDS TO STOP.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.213
[sighs]

10:13.213 --> 10:14.614
SHE HAS NO RIGHT TO DICTATE

10:14.614 --> 10:15.683
WHO I'M SEEING OR WHEN

10:15.683 --> 10:16.583
I'M SEEING THEM.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.751
IN TRACI'S MIND,

10:17.751 --> 10:18.652
I HAVE THESE WOMEN AROUND

10:18.652 --> 10:20.220
MY SON, BUT I DON'T.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.422
I DON'T [bleep] WITH THE HAs.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.090
I DON'T DATE--

10:23.090 --> 10:23.891
YOU DON'T THINK THEY HOES.

10:23.891 --> 10:24.624
I DON'T DATE GROUPIES.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.492
YOU DON'T THINK THEY HOES.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.559
YOU DON'T THINK THEY GROUPIES.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.360
I KNOW A GROUPIE

10:27.360 --> 10:28.461
WHEN I SEE A GROUPIE.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.730
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THEM.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.430
AND YOU WIFE THEM UP--

10:30.430 --> 10:32.199
THE LAST GIRL WAS A NICE

HOLD ON, SIT DOWN.

10:36.036 --> 10:36.904
HOLD ON. SIT DOWN.

10:36.904 --> 10:37.637
DON'T TOUCH ME.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.305
SIT DOWN.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.874
DON'T TOUCH ME. I'M OUT.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.143

10:43.911 --> 10:44.845
THE QUEEN NEED TO TAKE CHARGE

10:44.845 --> 10:45.545

10:45.545 --> 10:46.213
MM.

10:46.213 --> 10:46.947
I DEFINITELY NEED TO RUN

10:46.947 --> 10:47.881
THE PALACE PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT

10:47.881 --> 10:48.716
BETTER THAN I'VE BEEN RUNNING

10:48.716 --> 10:49.783
THE PALACE, BECAUSE THEY JUST

10:55.555 --> 10:56.890
FROM MY MONEY, IT'S GONNA BE

10:56.890 --> 10:58.926
A PROBLEM.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.894
SHE LOVES ME.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.595
SHE LOVES ME NOT.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.330
I WILL ALWAYS...

11:03.330 --> 11:04.264
SHE LOVES ME.
