EDIE: I'm married,

00:04.265 --> 00:05.701
and I love my husband

00:05.744 --> 00:08.051
and my career, and I'm not
gonna throw it all away.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.270
You're gonna tell me
you can't do this.

00:09.313 --> 00:10.401
Yeah.

00:10.445 --> 00:11.837
ROXY: I am so sick

00:11.881 --> 00:14.405
of being paraded around

00:14.449 --> 00:15.537
like a circus freak.

00:15.580 --> 00:16.538
That's not who I am anymore.

00:16.581 --> 00:17.713
ISAAC: You're not this person

00:17.756 --> 00:19.062
that they're dragging
on Twitter.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.281
Why don't you just show them
who you really are?

00:20.324 --> 00:22.370
-Is he single?
-Um...I suppose.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.763
Why don't I whip us up
a couple Hot Pockets?

00:24.807 --> 00:26.461
LEON: The only thing
that got me through

00:26.504 --> 00:28.289
sitting in that jail cell
was you,

00:28.332 --> 00:30.508
knowing that you'd be
out here waiting for me.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.467
I'm not gonna help you anymore.
I'm done.

00:32.510 --> 00:35.209
I'd like to testify
against Leon Bechley.

Give me a heart attack,
why don't ya?

01:23.300 --> 01:25.433
You need to tell Diane
not to testify.

01:25.476 --> 01:26.738
How do you even know
about that?

01:26.782 --> 01:28.131
I have sisters
in high places now.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.133
They tell me things.

01:30.177 --> 01:31.221
Well, your mother believes
it's the right thing to do,

01:31.265 --> 01:32.222
and you know how she gets.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.354
She gets something in her head,

01:33.397 --> 01:34.616
and you can't
talk her out of it.

01:34.659 --> 01:35.791
You know, I might finally
have something good

01:35.834 --> 01:37.053
happening in my life,
and I don't want her

01:37.097 --> 01:39.490
to come in and wreck it,
like she always does.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.231
You know I got this kid
I'm gonna train?

01:41.275 --> 01:43.407
Oh, yeah?
Training's a good next chapter.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.322
Where you training her out of?
Karolyi's ranch?

01:45.366 --> 01:46.410
Twistars?

01:46.454 --> 01:48.151
Actually,
she's a private client.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.936
Yeah, she's really promising.
She has a lot of potential.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.547
Oh, is she paying ya?

01:53.635 --> 01:55.680
Why is it always about money
with you people?

01:55.724 --> 01:56.812
You need to make a living.

01:56.855 --> 01:59.162
You don't have a fallback,
honey.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.946
Taking on some girl
who has no idea of your value

02:00.990 --> 02:02.426
doesn't sound like a good one.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.167
Why do you have to be
like this?

02:04.211 --> 02:07.953
I'm still your dad,
whether you believe it or not.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.955
I want what's best for you.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.479
Then tell Diane not to testify.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.568
Take a little more
off the beard.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.396
He's starting to look
like Santa Claus.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.745
Rox.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.877
Come on, sweetie.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.749
JULIA: "Not Parent Expected,"

02:20.792 --> 02:22.968
that's what
the phenomenon's called,

02:23.012 --> 02:25.275
when you find out
your father isn't the man

02:25.319 --> 02:27.364
you thought he was.

02:27.408 --> 02:30.715
It's shattering,
life-changing,

02:30.759 --> 02:33.457
and that's why we offer
a support system here.

02:33.501 --> 02:36.417
We have therapy groups
run by many pro--

02:36.460 --> 02:38.375
I'm not here for support.

02:38.419 --> 02:41.465
I really just need
Leon Bechley's medical records.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.598
My parents were clients,

02:43.641 --> 02:46.992
and I took the free DNA test,
and it turns out...

02:47.036 --> 02:48.211
You're one of my father's...

02:48.255 --> 02:49.995
Yeah.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.433
Oh.
Hi.

02:52.476 --> 02:55.871
Um...I know how strange
this all is,

02:55.914 --> 02:59.222
the idea that suddenly you have
dozens of brothers and sisters

02:59.266 --> 03:01.746
out there
you never knew existed.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.445
So if you wanna check out
one of our groups, um,

03:04.488 --> 03:05.707
I can give you some more--

03:05.750 --> 03:07.274
Yeah, I have a career
and a relationship.

03:07.317 --> 03:10.494
I can't let your father's
actions derail my entire life.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.801
When a class action suit
gets filed,

03:12.844 --> 03:14.106
believe me, I'll sign up.

03:14.150 --> 03:16.283
But, uh, in the meantime,
my husband and I are

03:16.326 --> 03:17.806
thinking about starting
a family,

03:17.849 --> 03:20.765
so I really need
the medical records.

03:20.809 --> 03:23.638
I hear you, and, uh,
we can help with that,

03:23.681 --> 03:25.292
discreetly and quickly.

03:25.335 --> 03:26.989
-We're, uh, professionals here.
-JULIA: Oh, we are.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.992
And husband?
Oh...that's fun.

03:30.035 --> 03:31.689
I mean, it's--
I mean, it's great,

03:31.733 --> 03:33.822
'cause it's--it's...
it's normal.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.693
But I mean, it's, like--
of course it's normal.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.391
It's just that I don't know
what I'm talking about.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.610
I'm just nervous
'cause you're my brother,

03:39.654 --> 03:41.264
kind of.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.746
So how long will that take,
the medical records?

03:44.789 --> 03:46.748
Usually eight to ten
working days.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.271
But we can put a rush on it.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.273
Just let us know where you want
the records, and we'll...

03:50.317 --> 03:51.796
Get 'em there.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.625
Uh, you can find me here.

03:54.669 --> 03:57.541
Oh, you're the general manager
of Madelia.

03:57.585 --> 03:58.760
I love that restaurant.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.588
I mean,
I can never get in there

04:00.631 --> 04:02.851
or afford it,
but it looks so delicious

04:02.894 --> 04:05.419
from, you know, the outside.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.769
Okay.

04:07.812 --> 04:11.555
Um, how many
have you met so far,

04:11.599 --> 04:14.297
you know...of us?

04:14.341 --> 04:18.083
Well, there's three others,

04:18.127 --> 04:21.043
and now there's you.

04:22.044 --> 04:24.481
Huh.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.528
Well, okay, thank you.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.747
Okay, bye.
Ciao.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.924
-ISAAC: "Ciao"?
-JULIA: Shut up.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.492
Not every strand
of your dad's DNA

04:35.536 --> 04:37.320
wants to connect with you.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.322
I know it's hard,
'cause you're kind

04:39.366 --> 04:40.323
and generous...

04:40.367 --> 04:41.933
Whoa, where did that come from?

04:41.977 --> 04:43.544
I wanna ask you something,

04:43.587 --> 04:46.111
and I don't want this
to get weird.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.114
Okay.

04:50.855 --> 04:54.337
Would you be okay
if I, uh, ask

04:54.381 --> 04:57.993
Roxy out, like, on a date?

04:59.951 --> 05:01.649
Oh, oh.
Ye-yeah.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.129
Hell to the yes.
Hell yes.

05:04.173 --> 05:07.872
Uh, yeah, you guys would make
such a cute couple.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.745
I've actually pictured that
a lot, you two together.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.747
You pictured us together?

05:12.790 --> 05:15.010
Yeah, now I hear that,
and that came out wrong.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.664
Um, okay,
I gotta get back to work.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.970
So excuse me.

05:19.014 --> 05:19.928
Gotta go.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.756
Okay.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.682
It's like grass
at Yankee Stadium to me.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.814
Brings me back to my going
on grand rounds,

05:36.858 --> 05:40.514
a nervous medical student,
hoping not to make a mistake--

05:40.557 --> 05:42.907
Okay, I, uh, hate to stop
the nostalgia train,

05:42.951 --> 05:45.040
but this is damage control,

05:45.083 --> 05:47.869
an attempt to mitigate
your severely damaged

05:47.912 --> 05:49.218
public reputation.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.002
Okay, but let's not be
entirely mercenary about it.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.656
I also want to give back.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.964
I have decades of experience
and expertise

05:56.007 --> 05:58.358
that I wanna share, you know.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.926
Uh, my client is reporting
as a volunteer.

06:01.970 --> 06:04.581
Dr. Leon Bechley.
I am a board-certified

06:04.625 --> 06:06.148
reproductive endocrinologist,

06:06.191 --> 06:08.846
and I'm happy to do
any consulting you might need.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.674
I know who you are--or were.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.415
And I've got a nice
big stapling project

06:12.459 --> 06:14.417
for you, Doctor.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.679
Dazzle me.

06:16.724 --> 06:17.986
Yeah, that--that--well--

06:18.029 --> 06:19.117
Okay, if you have any chance

06:19.161 --> 06:20.858
of practicing medicine
ever again,

06:20.902 --> 06:22.120
you need to do this.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.557
You need to do it right.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.515
This is the only way through,
okay?

06:25.559 --> 06:26.908
Yeah, I mean,
I really--I can't tell

06:26.951 --> 06:28.562
if you're reassuring me
or threatening me.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.477
Consider it a little bit
of both.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.665
So what happened?
Why the setback?

06:44.708 --> 06:47.450
I don't know that it's
a setback, per se.

06:47.494 --> 06:50.714
A witness came forward who's
willing to go on the record

06:50.758 --> 06:53.021
that what Leon did
constitutes assault.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.719
What happened to making a deal
with the prosecutor?

06:55.763 --> 06:57.547
Thought I told you
to charm her.

06:57.591 --> 07:01.812
You know, she was a lot tougher
than I thought she'd be,

07:01.856 --> 07:03.205
but we're on it.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.252
Oh, sorry about that.

07:07.296 --> 07:10.778
It's a client of mine,
a young guy.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.562
-You know how they are.
-CHAD: Mm-hmm.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.999
Well,
keep me posted on Bechley.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.131
This is the kind of case
that gets you

07:16.174 --> 07:18.089
on the partner track.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.961
Depending on how it goes.

07:25.793 --> 07:28.578
A client of yours.
Quick thinking.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.493
-I had to say something.
-Which niece is it?

07:30.537 --> 07:31.494
TIM: Mia.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.756
She just got this new puppy

07:32.800 --> 07:34.062
and can't stop sending me
these photos.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.586
-Hey!
-Oh, give me that.

07:36.630 --> 07:40.938
Oh!
She is too cute.

07:40.982 --> 07:44.681
Time for Aunt Edie to send her
all the emojis.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.684
So when do we get to do this?

07:47.728 --> 07:48.729
Uh, what,
get a puppy?

07:48.772 --> 07:49.947
Never.
We just got our floors done.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.863
Edie, I mean a baby.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.518
-Are you serious?
-I love you.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.520
I want us to have a family
of our own.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.957
But I just--I don't know
if it's the right time

08:00.001 --> 08:01.002
for a baby.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.830
-The case...
-They say it's never

08:02.873 --> 08:04.571
the right time.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.964
And plus, you'd be
such an incredible mother.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.097
You're perfect to be a mom.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.707
Do you really think that?

08:10.751 --> 08:14.102
I know it, and I'm afraid
to wait too long.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.625
You know,
seeing all these couples

08:15.669 --> 08:17.714
that had to go to Leon,
so desperate,

08:17.758 --> 08:18.933
I don't want that to be us.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.238
Me either.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.679
So what do you think?

08:25.722 --> 08:28.029
Can we start to have
that conversation?

08:29.987 --> 08:31.772
Can I think about it?

08:31.815 --> 08:32.947
Of course.

08:47.309 --> 08:50.399
AMANDA: My grandmother used to
take me here when I was a kid.

08:50.442 --> 08:53.097
Yeah, my parents weren't
all that into...

08:53.141 --> 08:54.403
a lot of stuff about me,

08:54.446 --> 08:56.927
and then the whole lesbian
situation...

08:56.971 --> 08:58.102
not their bag.

08:58.146 --> 09:01.802
But...Grandma,

09:01.845 --> 09:03.978
she was cool
with whoever I was.

09:05.719 --> 09:09.853
So this place
always makes me feel good...

09:09.897 --> 09:11.899
brave.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.336
Cookie?

09:14.379 --> 09:15.424
Oh, I'm off sugar.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.687
No, this is worth it.
Believe me.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.384
I had one with friends
over the weekend,

09:19.428 --> 09:21.909
and all I could
think about was,

09:21.952 --> 09:24.651
"I need Edie to experience
this cookie."

09:24.694 --> 09:27.044
We had to come all the way
to Brooklyn for that?

09:27.088 --> 09:29.917
And I, uh...

09:29.960 --> 09:31.135
I wanted to see
what it felt like

09:31.179 --> 09:32.441
to be somewhere with you
where we didn't

09:32.484 --> 09:34.269
have to worry about
getting caught every second.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.057
How does it feel?

09:40.101 --> 09:42.016
Like I can get used to it.

09:47.195 --> 09:50.894
SINGERS: ♪ I saw you coming,
hit me like a freight train ♪

09:50.938 --> 09:52.330
Whoa, a Ferrari!

09:52.374 --> 09:54.028
That's not what it is, stupid.

09:54.071 --> 09:56.944
Hey, lady,
where'd you get that car?

09:56.987 --> 09:58.946
Hey, here's 20 bucks.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.251
Watch the wheels, okay?

10:00.295 --> 10:01.731
Oh, I'll watch 'em,
all right.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.168
SINGERS: ♪ Just you and me

10:09.391 --> 10:10.827
Hi, can I help you?

10:10.871 --> 10:12.133
I'm Roxy Doyle.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.831
Oh, yeah, the, uh--
the cartwheel lady?

10:14.875 --> 10:16.311
Izzy said she had fun with you.

10:16.354 --> 10:19.880
The, uh...Olympian.
Yeah.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.272
I'm here to take your daughter
out for some training.

10:21.316 --> 10:22.360
She's really talented.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.361
I think she could have
a future.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.580
Right, great, yeah.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.017
Um, can you have her back
in, like, an hour?

10:27.061 --> 10:28.149
We're supposed to go
to my sister's.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.367
An hour?
It's gonna take an hour

10:29.411 --> 10:30.542
just to get warmed up.

10:30.586 --> 10:31.848
I'm gonna need
at least three hours.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.023
And then once she gets
more serious,

10:33.067 --> 10:34.111
it'll ramp up from there.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.113
Hey.
Yo, Izzy, are you ready?

10:36.157 --> 10:38.376
Oh, well, then she'll just have
to do it another time.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.901
My sister's expecting us.
It's her birthday, so...

10:40.944 --> 10:42.729
Okay.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.340
If you wanna train
at a professional level,

10:45.383 --> 10:47.037
you're gonna have to make
some sacrifices.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.560
Do you think I went
to birthday parties

10:48.604 --> 10:49.910
when I was training?
I didn't.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.999
I didn't even look
at a cupcake.

10:52.042 --> 10:56.046
I'm sorry, it's just not
gonna work out today.

10:56.090 --> 10:59.049
Uh, maybe this weekend.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.835
Sorry, my mom says I can't.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.272
Who cares what your mom says?

11:04.315 --> 11:06.100
I do.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.974
All right.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.980
-Fries for lunch?
-They comfort me.

11:17.024 --> 11:19.330
So I'm thinking
I'm dropping off the records

11:19.374 --> 11:21.245
at the restaurant myself.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.247
But you said he doesn't want
anything to do with us.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.684
At first.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.338
And then right before he left,
he got all curious.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.992
I think there's something
going on

11:29.036 --> 11:31.386
underneath those gorgeous
celadon eyes.

11:32.430 --> 11:35.085
"Gorgeous celadon eyes"?

11:35.129 --> 11:36.434
Please don't tell me
you're attracted

11:36.478 --> 11:37.958
to another brother.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.350
That was a mistake.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.352
And no, that's the best part.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.789
He's gay.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.442
Why are you saying that
like you won a prize?

11:44.486 --> 11:46.618
I'm not.

11:46.662 --> 11:49.883
He's just another person
whose life has been upended,

11:49.926 --> 11:51.928
and I'm in a unique position
to help.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.104
Okay, fine.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.584
I've always wanted
a gay brother.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.586
You know, someone
who shares my interests

11:57.629 --> 12:01.329
and is around all the time
and isn't disgusting

12:01.372 --> 12:02.591
like straight men.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.071
You know
what I'm talking about.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.333
-I'm not alone in this fantasy.
-You're not alone.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.551
Thank you.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.902
But he doesn't wanna know you
or us,

12:08.945 --> 12:10.120
and that's completely
his right.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.513
I know.

12:11.556 --> 12:14.124
I'm just gonna drop off
my dad's medical records

12:14.168 --> 12:16.953
at the restaurant,
and that's it.

12:19.173 --> 12:23.003
I'm doing it again, aren't I?
I didn't even know I did that.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.135
Apparently, I've had this
annoying tooth-tapping habit

12:25.179 --> 12:26.310
for years.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.660
I had no idea the whole time.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.010
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

12:30.053 --> 12:31.620
No, I don't wanna tell you.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.317
Tim wants to have kids.

12:35.406 --> 12:38.018
Oh, wow.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.020
So, um, what do you want?

12:40.063 --> 12:43.153
To not have to think about it
for the next ten years or so.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.155
Right, well, as someone

12:45.199 --> 12:46.461
who works
at a fertility clinic--

12:46.504 --> 12:48.550
I know, my biological clock...

12:49.725 --> 12:52.554
I love kids, and I love Tim.

12:52.597 --> 12:55.339
But I just--I...

12:55.383 --> 12:58.560
I'm just starting to feel like
I don't know what I want.

12:58.603 --> 12:59.909
Because of what happened
with Amanda?

12:59.953 --> 13:01.345
Keep it down.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.435
The whole restaurant
doesn't need to know.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.698
Sorry.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.526
I love him, Julia. I do.

13:08.570 --> 13:13.488
But...I think--and it makes me
feel defective

13:13.531 --> 13:15.359
to even say this out loud,

13:15.403 --> 13:19.320
but I don't think
I have that thing

13:19.363 --> 13:21.931
that people are supposed
to have at my age:

13:21.975 --> 13:23.411
"Must procreate."

13:23.454 --> 13:25.935
"Without kids,
I'm a failure of a human."

13:25.979 --> 13:28.198
I-I-I don't have it.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.460
Mm.

13:29.504 --> 13:32.333
And if I told Tim,
it would break his heart.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.555
You need these.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.079
I do.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.952
WOMAN :
Dr. Bender.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.261
Is everything okay?

13:47.304 --> 13:49.393
Yeah, I'm just, uh, restocking.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.586
Who are you?

14:08.630 --> 14:10.545
I'm, uh, Dr. Bechley.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.590
I'm here to help.

14:12.634 --> 14:16.203
So there's no
genetic disorders in his DNA.

14:16.246 --> 14:19.423
Uh, he has some hypertension,
but that's lifestyle-related.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.121
And, uh, yeah,
you should be good.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.297
So you and your husband
can start planning

14:23.340 --> 14:24.428
a family of your own.

14:24.472 --> 14:25.777
Thank you.
That's amazing news.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.475
Yeah, just wanting
to be helpful.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.999
Well, you really didn't have
to hand-deliver it.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.479
No, it's no big deal.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.743
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

14:34.786 --> 14:37.572
'Cause I'm sensing
something's going on.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.443
I'm very sensitive.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.358
It's kind of a blessing
and a curse.

14:41.402 --> 14:44.318
Fine.
Can I clear something up first?

14:44.361 --> 14:47.016
I need to know that you're not
one of those

14:47.060 --> 14:49.453
desperate single women
I meet at a wedding

14:49.497 --> 14:51.629
or in the checkout line
at the grocery store

14:51.673 --> 14:54.458
who won't stop texting me

14:54.502 --> 14:57.722
and have this offensive fantasy
of having a gay best friend.

14:57.766 --> 15:00.290
It's really annoying,
and I don't have the bandwidth.

15:00.334 --> 15:03.032
I'm not that person.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.381
Okay.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.168
I'm not sure
I wanna have kids.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.605
Oh.

15:10.648 --> 15:13.216
I think maybe I was
hiding a little bit

15:13.260 --> 15:15.740
behind the whole
medical history thing.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.438
Why am I saying this to you?

15:17.481 --> 15:19.309
People open up to me.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.745
-Blessing and a curse?
-Kinda.

15:24.053 --> 15:27.274
I think maybe I was
using it as a an excuse

15:27.317 --> 15:30.668
to not have to try.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.366
Does that sound terrible?

15:32.409 --> 15:33.497
No.

15:33.541 --> 15:37.501
That--that sounds actually
very familiar.

15:38.807 --> 15:42.245
You know, not everyone
has that feeling, that...

15:42.289 --> 15:45.422
"Must procreate or else
I'm a defective human."

15:45.466 --> 15:46.728
Yes, exactly.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.512
I...

15:49.731 --> 15:51.733
I love Richard.

15:51.776 --> 15:54.301
I don't wanna lose him.

15:54.344 --> 15:58.087
But I'm scared
that if we start a family,

15:58.131 --> 16:00.220
we'll lose what makes us great
as a couple.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.483
That's completely
understandable.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.702
Well, these days,

16:04.746 --> 16:06.661
you're in the minority
as a gay man

16:06.704 --> 16:08.141
if you think that way.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.143
I don't think it's selfish
to prioritize

16:10.186 --> 16:11.187
your own marriage.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.102
That's how I feel,

16:13.146 --> 16:16.845
but I'm not sure Richard
will understand.

16:16.888 --> 16:19.195
Well, have you talked to him
about it?

16:20.588 --> 16:21.545
No.

16:22.677 --> 16:23.591
What?

16:24.635 --> 16:27.508
What?
Oh, God, was I out of line?

16:27.551 --> 16:29.858
No, no, not at all.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.294
You're right.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.556
Yeah.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.254
Okay, I'll talk to him.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.343
Good.
That's a good idea.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.519
Anyway, I will
get out of your hair.

16:38.562 --> 16:40.564
Hey, um, I'm sorry
I clocked you

16:40.608 --> 16:42.131
as a desperate single person.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.393
-Oh...
-That was unfair.

16:43.437 --> 16:46.701
I got, you know,
all this insight.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.660
You must be in a committed
relationship of your own.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.490
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, I am.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.231
-Okay, well, I'm gonna go.
-Wait.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.885
I talked about myself so much.

16:56.928 --> 17:00.149
Tell me about him...her?

17:00.193 --> 17:01.324
Him.

17:02.543 --> 17:05.763
He...he's a lawyer,

17:05.807 --> 17:07.939
a very, very good lawyer.

17:07.983 --> 17:11.813
And he's just incredibly kind

17:11.856 --> 17:14.772
and not in, like,
a pushover kind of way.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.426
You know,
he's one of those people

17:16.470 --> 17:19.255
that when he walks
into the room,

17:19.299 --> 17:22.563
you just--you just feel good.

17:22.606 --> 17:26.523
He's just so...steady.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.438
Jeez, now I wanna date him.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.398
What's his name?

17:32.790 --> 17:36.838
His name is...Tim.

17:43.888 --> 17:44.933
What happened here?

17:44.976 --> 17:47.936
I got in a fight
with a subway door.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.720
I thought I was trapped.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.635
Oh.

17:51.679 --> 17:55.030
How does it feel now?
Any pain or...

17:55.074 --> 17:56.031
Mm.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.033
Where'd you serve?

17:59.948 --> 18:02.124
Kandahar mostly.

18:02.168 --> 18:05.475
How's it feel
being back?

18:05.519 --> 18:07.782
I can't do anything
without feeling like

18:07.825 --> 18:09.479
I'm under attack.

18:10.611 --> 18:13.527
A truck backfires,
I'm on the floor.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.442
My girlfriend's alarm clock
goes off,

18:15.485 --> 18:18.532
and I think something's
gonna explode.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.317
Might as well still be there.

18:21.361 --> 18:22.536
Hmm.

18:22.579 --> 18:25.930
You know, it's, uh--
it's completely normal.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.455
The nervous system
can get stuck

18:28.498 --> 18:29.978
after it's experienced danger.

18:30.021 --> 18:32.459
You're responding
to everyday things

18:32.502 --> 18:35.026
as though they were
life-threatening.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.506
You a shrink?

18:36.550 --> 18:40.336
Hardly.
No, I just know a few things.

18:41.555 --> 18:44.384
Is there a way to make it
so I'm not so freaked out

18:44.427 --> 18:45.428
all the time?

18:45.472 --> 18:47.038
You know, actually,
talking about it

18:47.082 --> 18:48.823
seems to be the best way,
especially with those

18:48.866 --> 18:50.520
who have been there.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.914
They keep trying to get me
to go to a support group here,

18:52.957 --> 18:55.699
but I don't--I don't really do
that kind of thing.

18:55.743 --> 18:56.744
Mm.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.747
You know, maybe, uh, try it.

18:59.790 --> 19:03.185
Besides, you know, you wanna
take care of those hands,

19:03.229 --> 19:05.840
if you're gonna pick up
the guitar again.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.624
How do you know I play guitar?

19:08.625 --> 19:09.757
RESIDENT: Sergeant Winters,

19:09.800 --> 19:11.019
how are we doing today?

19:11.062 --> 19:13.369
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you new here?

19:13.413 --> 19:16.459
Oh, I was just dropping off
some fresh rolls of, uh,

19:16.503 --> 19:17.547
toilet tissue.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.071
Uh, you know,
he's got some edema

19:20.115 --> 19:22.683
in his right hand,
and you might wanna

19:22.726 --> 19:24.902
lower his prednisone
to five milligrams.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.730
Thank you for your service,
Sergeant.

19:29.516 --> 19:30.908
I'm very proud of you.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.527
Chess.
Really?

19:40.570 --> 19:42.920
This is Edie Palmer's
secret place?

19:42.964 --> 19:45.184
My mom used to take me here
when I was a kid.

19:45.227 --> 19:49.449
I come here if I'm sad,
pick up a game.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.190
All the bad stuff disappears.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.977
Push your pawn.
It's your only chance.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.761
Hey, is that Edie?

19:58.849 --> 20:00.111
Max.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.157
MAX: I'm about done with her.
You play next?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.245
EDIE: Can't today.
Rain check?

20:03.289 --> 20:04.855
I'll hold you to it.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.640
Good to see you, Max.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.123
-What?
-Nothing.

20:13.603 --> 20:14.909
Thanks for showing me this.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.956
Tim wants to have kids.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.009
It totally blindsided me.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.924
I mean, it's not like
we haven't talked about it,

20:29.967 --> 20:31.186
but...

20:33.319 --> 20:35.190
What did you say?

20:36.626 --> 20:39.107
I'm confused, Amanda.

20:39.150 --> 20:41.283
Tim and I were on this track,

20:41.327 --> 20:45.069
and then you came along

20:45.113 --> 20:47.550
and confused me.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.944
And things were perfect
with Tim before I came along?

20:49.987 --> 20:51.641
No, of course not.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.688
But what is perfect?

20:54.731 --> 20:57.081
Can any of us expect our lives
to be perfect?

20:57.125 --> 21:01.172
No, but you should
at least aim for happy.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.611
Are you happy with Tim?

21:06.003 --> 21:08.658
I feel guilty
even talking to you about this.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.009
Then why are you?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.664
I mean, why are we here?

21:14.708 --> 21:17.014
You took me
to your sacred spot.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.799
You didn't have
to take me here.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.109
Hey.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.677
Uh, so you date a lot.

21:27.721 --> 21:30.550
-Um...
-Not a lot, like...a lot.

21:30.593 --> 21:31.986
I was wondering
what you thought about

21:32.029 --> 21:33.857
the Museum of Natural History.

21:33.901 --> 21:35.642
As an institution?

21:35.685 --> 21:36.643
First date.

21:36.686 --> 21:38.297
Sounds great.
Is she 12?

21:38.340 --> 21:40.124
No, it's Roxy.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.604
Do you think she'd like it
or...

21:41.648 --> 21:44.999
Oh, I-I-I don't know.
I have no idea.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.566
I mean, I've known her,
like, a month.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.176
Right, 'cause then I was
thinking we'd take a walk

21:48.219 --> 21:49.873
through Central Park after.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.701
Oh.
cool.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.009
Neato.

21:55.052 --> 21:56.010
-Is there a problem?
-No.

21:56.053 --> 21:57.011
I just--I don't know why

21:57.054 --> 21:58.186
you're talking to me
about this,

21:58.229 --> 21:59.230
'cause I told you,
you have my permission

21:59.274 --> 22:00.319
to go on a date with her.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.537
-Permission?
-And beyond that,

22:01.581 --> 22:02.582
I have no advice for you,

22:02.625 --> 22:03.670
besides don't bring up
Dartmouth

22:03.713 --> 22:04.714
every other sentence.

22:04.758 --> 22:05.672
I never say Dartmouth--

22:05.715 --> 22:07.021
You always bring up Dartmouth.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.457
It'll make her self-conscious.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.198
She has a whole thing about
not finishing high school.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.895
She dropped out of high school?

22:13.680 --> 22:16.073
There's a lot
that you don't know about Roxy.

22:16.117 --> 22:17.205
I mean, how could you?

22:17.248 --> 22:19.163
You've known her
for, like, two days.

22:19.207 --> 22:21.601
Just keep the Ivy League
boasting to a minimum

22:21.644 --> 22:24.560
and you'll be fine.

22:27.171 --> 22:30.261
I don't talk about Dartmouth...

22:30.305 --> 22:32.916
a lot.

22:32.960 --> 22:36.137
SINGER:
♪ I am gonna change it up

22:37.356 --> 22:39.880
♪ And that's all right

22:39.923 --> 22:41.664
♪ Doing all right

22:41.708 --> 22:43.100
Thank you.
That's my favorite.

22:43.144 --> 22:47.017
So we just sit here and soak?

22:47.061 --> 22:48.149
Yeah.

22:48.192 --> 22:51.195
I mean, the point is
to relax, to chat.

22:51.239 --> 22:53.067
I can't believe you've never
gotten a pedicure before.

22:53.110 --> 22:55.243
I know.
I'm a terrible gay.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.680
Except for
the sex with men part,

22:57.724 --> 22:58.942
I'm pretty good at that.

22:58.986 --> 23:00.248
Me too.

23:01.902 --> 23:02.946
Mm.

23:02.990 --> 23:06.733
So, um, how are you?

23:06.776 --> 23:09.344
How are you feeling
about finding out

23:09.388 --> 23:11.651
your dad isn't your dad?

23:12.869 --> 23:15.742
Well, my dad is my dad.
He raised me.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.092
Yeah, sorry, I know.

23:18.135 --> 23:22.226
I just mean if you wanna know
about Leon,

23:22.270 --> 23:26.100
other than medical stuff,
I have stories.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.319
Lots of stories.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.060
I do have a question.

23:31.061 --> 23:34.195
How are you doing
with all of it?

23:34.238 --> 23:35.849
SINGER: ♪ I believe in me

23:35.892 --> 23:38.025
-Me?
-Yeah.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.636
Can you ever forgive him?

23:40.680 --> 23:43.073
Hmm.

23:43.117 --> 23:44.814
I don't know.

23:46.816 --> 23:51.038
It would be easy for me to say
that I hate him,

23:51.081 --> 23:55.303
that he's a liar,
and that everything

23:55.346 --> 23:59.220
that he was to me as a father
is gone.

23:59.263 --> 24:03.703
But...I don't know.
That's not how I feel.

24:05.356 --> 24:07.446
It's not that simple.

24:11.754 --> 24:13.321
Now who's the one
that's opening up?

24:18.108 --> 24:20.328
Well, at least you have
your new sisters.

24:20.371 --> 24:21.721
That must be a plus.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.897
Yeah, it is a plus.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.116
Except one is holed up
in my guest room,

24:26.160 --> 24:27.814
dating a coworker of mine,

24:27.857 --> 24:30.207
and the other one is sleeping
with a woman, which is great,

24:30.251 --> 24:31.426
except she's married to a man

24:31.470 --> 24:33.689
who I used to date
in another life.

You know what you guys need?

24:36.257 --> 24:38.825
Dinner at the restaurant.

24:38.868 --> 24:41.175
I'll text the host,
grab you a table, my treat.

24:41.218 --> 24:43.394
-Oh, my God, really?
-Yeah.

24:43.438 --> 24:45.005
I never would have been
so honest with Richard

24:45.048 --> 24:47.050
if you hadn't given me
the courage.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.967
-Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

24:51.011 --> 24:53.274
And, uh, why don't you
bring Tim?

24:53.317 --> 24:54.754
Is he close with the girls?

24:56.320 --> 25:00.194
He is,
especially one of them.

25:00.237 --> 25:02.196
Great, it's done.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.068
Hi.

25:13.337 --> 25:14.643
Okay.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.602
For real, I thought
that was gonna be super lame.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.429
I haven't been there since,
like, second grade.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.867
I forgot about that blue whale.
It's freaking huge.

25:20.910 --> 25:21.868
Mm-hmm.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.347
Yeah, I come here twice a year,

25:23.391 --> 25:25.306
just to walk through
the biodiversity hall.

25:25.349 --> 25:26.829
It's humbling, you know?

25:26.873 --> 25:30.485
They have, like, 600,000
different types of protoctists.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.792
Yeah, it's exciting.

25:32.835 --> 25:35.925
Sorry, it's, uh--it was
the first research study

25:35.969 --> 25:39.494
that I did when I was at...

25:39.538 --> 25:41.801
Never mind.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.325
When, uh--when you were
at where?

25:44.368 --> 25:46.327
Dartmouth.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.374
I always talk about Dartmouth,
but...

25:51.898 --> 25:53.900
Why--why can't you
talk about Dartmouth?

25:55.292 --> 25:58.644
I don't--I don't wanna make you
feel like...

25:58.687 --> 26:02.822
I don't wanna sound--'cause
it doesn't matter, you know?

26:02.865 --> 26:06.303
Bill Gates, Steve Jobs,
they didn't finish college.

26:06.347 --> 26:07.870
Einstein dropped out
of high school.

26:07.914 --> 26:11.831
Okay, so Julia told you that
I didn't finish high school.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.964
Yeah.
This is my bad, okay?

26:15.008 --> 26:16.531
Julia was just trying to--

26:16.575 --> 26:18.446
I know what Julia
was trying to do.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.623
Look, I may not have
graduated high school,

26:21.667 --> 26:23.277
but I'm not an idiot.

26:24.321 --> 26:26.846
I wouldn't be here
if I thought you were.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.985
-Wow!
-I'm sorry.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.944
Yeah, you just--you went
for that, huh?

26:37.987 --> 26:39.641
Yeah.

26:39.685 --> 26:43.689
No, it's--I like that
you don't hold yourself back.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.429
Gonna do that more often,
I guess.

26:45.473 --> 26:48.432
Yeah.
You should.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.656
EDIE: What happened
to keeping your head down?

26:54.700 --> 26:57.485
What good was I doing anyone
pushing a janitor's cart?

26:57.528 --> 26:58.921
I had to pull a lot of strings

26:58.965 --> 27:00.488
to get you that assignment,
Leon.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.533
Nobody wanted you back
in a hospital setting.

27:02.577 --> 27:03.970
Why would you engage
with a patient?

27:04.013 --> 27:05.711
'Cause I'm a doctor.
I knew I could help him.

27:05.754 --> 27:08.583
You and Julia
and your savior complexes--

27:08.627 --> 27:10.324
-Our what?
-I'm fighting like hell

27:10.367 --> 27:12.021
to keep you out of prison,
Leon.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.719
Why would you try to make that
harder for me?

27:13.762 --> 27:14.981
Do you wanna be punished?

27:15.024 --> 27:16.460
Is that it?
Do you think you deserve it?

27:16.504 --> 27:17.984
No, look, there are connections

27:18.027 --> 27:19.986
that are more important
than career,

27:20.029 --> 27:23.554
you know,
ties that can't be denied.

27:23.598 --> 27:26.906
Ties that can't...

27:26.949 --> 27:28.298
Is that soldier one of--

27:28.342 --> 27:29.517
Before you, uh--

27:29.560 --> 27:31.780
Yep, yep, no.
He doesn't know.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.695
He has a story
about who his parents were,

27:33.739 --> 27:34.783
what his family was.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.829
But, uh, he's in
a vulnerable state,

27:36.872 --> 27:38.613
and I-I-I wouldn't
disturb that.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.441
Yeah, I know all about that.
Don't forget.

27:40.484 --> 27:45.011
Look, you don't know
what it's like

27:45.054 --> 27:47.448
to be someone's parent,
not yet.

27:47.491 --> 27:49.755
There's a sense of obligation
that you feel.

27:49.798 --> 27:51.713
You'll--you're gonna be
there for them--

27:51.757 --> 27:53.715
You are not that guy's parent,
Leon.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.457
You gotta stop thinking of it
like that.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.765
I'm not sure I have a choice.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.335
This is who I am.

28:08.774 --> 28:11.602
JULIA: This is so good.
Thank you.

28:11.646 --> 28:12.952
-Maybe some beluga?
-EDIE: Mm-hmm.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.649
-Should we get beluga?
-Hell yes.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.783
No offense, but I gotta say,
best sib yet.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.480
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you have Olema?

28:19.523 --> 28:21.917
Mm, good call.
Maybe a bottle of Dom?

28:21.961 --> 28:23.702
-EDIE: Yes.
-JULIE: Thank you.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.921
Cheers.
This is so much fun.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.532
You having fun?
Beluga is caviar.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.752
I know.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.841
May not have gone to a fancy
private school like you,

28:32.885 --> 28:34.756
but I'm not a complete moron.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.105
Okay, I didn't say you were.

28:36.149 --> 28:37.759
ROXY: Oh, really?

28:37.803 --> 28:38.760
'Cause apparently,
you told Isaac

28:38.804 --> 28:39.761
that I didn't graduate
high school.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.632
-No, I--no--
-ROXY: Yes.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.460
-Wow, Julia.
-I-I didn't mean to--

28:43.504 --> 28:44.766
ROXY: To make me look stupid?

28:44.810 --> 28:45.985
Are you jealous or something?

28:46.028 --> 28:47.987
-No.
-Then what is your problem?

28:48.030 --> 28:50.554
There--there isn't a problem.

28:50.598 --> 28:52.731
I just--I don't--I think
that you two are

28:52.774 --> 28:53.949
very different people.

28:53.993 --> 28:55.821
-Wow, you are jealous.
-I am not.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.648
-But I work with the guy.
-So?

28:57.692 --> 29:00.390
So you don't...
eat where you work.

29:00.434 --> 29:01.435
What?

29:01.478 --> 29:02.175
Mm, nope.
That's not an expression.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.393
I don't know.
Nate!

29:04.133 --> 29:05.961
Hello, sisters.

29:06.005 --> 29:07.049
I didn't think you were
gonna be here.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.964
Well, I wanted to meet
my half sisters.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.531
You've told me so much
about them.

29:10.574 --> 29:11.706
-Hi. Roxy.
-Hello.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.968
What a family.

29:13.012 --> 29:15.666
Straight, gay, black, white.
We're such a mix.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.930
-I love it.
-Uh, I'm just a Mets fan.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.453
I'm not gay.

29:19.496 --> 29:20.846
Oh, so you're the gay one.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.413
Dude, nobody's gay.

29:23.457 --> 29:24.980
I cannot believe you, Julia.

29:25.024 --> 29:27.635
I'm so sorry.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.202
Wait. You're gay?

29:30.594 --> 29:31.726
What about Tim?

29:31.770 --> 29:32.814
Tim, you mean her husband, Tim?

29:32.858 --> 29:34.642
-No, my husband, Tim.
-I'm confused.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.600
You both have husbands
named Tim?

29:36.644 --> 29:37.906
-No.
-ROXY: No, no, no, no.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.603
Uh, Edie's husband
is named Tim.

29:39.647 --> 29:42.737
Julia doesn't have a husband,
like, not even close.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.956
And are you gay?

29:46.697 --> 29:48.047
What that hell is wrong
with you?

29:48.090 --> 29:49.091
Everything.

29:49.135 --> 29:52.486
Um, Nate, listen,
I-I can explain.

29:52.529 --> 29:53.748
No, no, I've heard enough.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.535
Well, I wish you all the best.

30:00.973 --> 30:02.888
Don't ever call me.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.063
No, wait.
Please.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.674
Table 12 is no longer comped.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.345
Guess I can cut up
that credit card.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.173
They already uncorked the Dom.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.871
Just so you know,
I got my GED,

30:29.915 --> 30:31.351
and I am
a high school graduate.

30:31.394 --> 30:33.527
I only dropped out
because I was working,

30:33.570 --> 30:35.877
and I had to keep
my family afloat, okay?

30:35.921 --> 30:40.229
And, Edie, the whole gay thing,
it's whatever.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.231
#BeYourself.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.451
I just wish you guys wouldn't
keep secrets from me.

30:47.410 --> 30:48.629
Listen...

30:48.672 --> 30:50.065
I'm gonna assume
that you do not have feelings

30:50.109 --> 30:51.893
for my husband and that this
was something far weirder

30:51.937 --> 30:53.329
and much more pathetic.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.810
It was.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.421
You are seriously damaged.

30:58.465 --> 31:01.511
Look, I just wanted him
to like me, and--and so I--

31:01.555 --> 31:02.904
Co-opted my life.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.210
I just wanted him to think
I had a life,

31:04.253 --> 31:05.820
and Tim was the first person
that I thought of

31:05.864 --> 31:08.910
because Tim was
the first person.

31:10.216 --> 31:12.000
-I'm sorry.
-I'm taking the subway.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.349
Good night.

31:32.499 --> 31:33.804
Hey.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.545
She's at school.

31:35.589 --> 31:38.984
Um, I'm actually here
to talk to you, not Izzy.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.902
I know I came on
kind of strong before.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.383
That's just because I know
she's super talented

31:47.427 --> 31:50.952
and that I could get her there,
to a really high level,

31:50.996 --> 31:54.608
if she takes it seriously,
if you take it seriously.

31:54.651 --> 31:57.524
She needs me.

31:59.265 --> 32:03.095
But the truth is,
I might need her more.

32:05.314 --> 32:08.230
That's the raw real, so...

32:08.274 --> 32:09.928
You know I can't pay you.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.407
Yeah.

32:11.451 --> 32:14.106
But I'm willing to make a deal.

32:14.149 --> 32:16.543
15% of her future earnings.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.110
Okay.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.459
You said yourself
you could get her there.

32:19.502 --> 32:21.461
Yeah, I-I know I can.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.464
So...

32:24.507 --> 32:26.248
So you're her coach...

32:26.292 --> 32:30.426
but I'm in charge of her life,
of her happiness.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.298
I'm gonna protect my daughter.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.476
Good. You should.

32:53.232 --> 32:55.103
Didn't expect to see you here
again.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.322
Ah.

32:56.365 --> 32:59.542
I wanted to talk to you.
I have a confession.

33:01.066 --> 33:04.417
I'm not really a doctor...
anymore.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.332
Yeah, I kinda guessed that.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.463
Really?

33:07.507 --> 33:09.422
Yeah, you don't, uh,
look as tired

33:09.465 --> 33:11.076
as everyone else around here,

33:11.119 --> 33:13.904
and you don't talk as fast.

33:13.948 --> 33:17.038
People here are always thinking
about the next patient.

33:17.082 --> 33:20.041
You know, Jesse, I've seen
a lot of things in my life,

33:20.085 --> 33:21.390
and I can tell you I think

33:21.434 --> 33:23.697
that the support group
could help.

33:23.740 --> 33:26.308
And you wouldn't be any worse
for it.

33:29.094 --> 33:31.009
Think about it.

about my boyfriend,

34:19.100 --> 34:21.972
and the words just started
coming out of my mouth.

34:22.016 --> 34:23.452

more alone.

34:51.567 --> 34:53.395
I know what you mean.

34:56.659 --> 35:00.185

35:00.228 --> 35:04.406
did Edie tell you
that her and I are...

35:05.538 --> 35:07.061

a family.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.500

I'm really happy for you.

35:11.544 --> 35:13.198
Thank you.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.374
Did she tell you if...

35:15.417 --> 35:17.289
I mean...

35:17.332 --> 35:19.726
do you think she's ready?

35:19.769 --> 35:21.162
It's hard for me to know
what's going on

35:21.206 --> 35:22.685
in her head lately,

35:22.729 --> 35:25.514
and I figured
she might have told you.

35:27.864 --> 35:32.217
I think you both are going to
be incredible parents one day.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.480

36:14.824 --> 36:17.392

you talked to him.

36:17.436 --> 36:18.828
Didn't have the guts
to talk to me yourself?

36:18.872 --> 36:20.439
-Diane--
-No, you know what?

36:20.482 --> 36:21.570
I'm done with that.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.659
I'm done with you
calling me Diane.
