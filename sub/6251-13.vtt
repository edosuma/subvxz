11:56.049 --> 11:58.836
I’d concentrate on

Something hit him
there— hard

figure out what that was...

it killed him.

Dan through dental school.

up and running, he dumped me.

At a velocity
of 82 meters per second,

13:50.706 --> 13:53.789
a hunting arrow
would not only pierce
the sternum and the heart,

13:53.875 --> 13:55.786
but would sever
the spinal column.

might still have
killed the victim.

But either he dio’n ’t use
a hunting bow...

14:04.177 --> 14:07.715

from the-the absolute—

which-which would be—

14:11.476 --> 14:13.967

the “very far,” yes.

in the chest?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.230

have been postmortem.

Probably as a result
of being tipped into a creek.

but which then led me
to stinging nettles,

in thousands
of tiny little arrows,

15:41.650 --> 15:43.982

15:44.069 --> 15:46.355

joined this team...

21:28.121 --> 21:30.737
because a lot of
the straight players don’t
want us on their teams.

21:30.832 --> 21:34.245
We’re like family.
No one here hurt Dan.

21:34.377 --> 21:37.335
No way.
And you’re all gay?

21:37.422 --> 21:39.333
Oh, I suppose,
statistically,

21:39.424 --> 21:42.006
we could have
two or three straights
who are still in the closet.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.833
[ Laughing]

21:43.928 --> 21:45.964
Booth, this is
Dan ’3 equioment bag.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.046
I found his protective
headgear inside.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.723
- That’s a helmet, Bones.
- [ Laughter]

21:50.810 --> 21:52.596
There’s blood
on the inside of the lip.

21:52.687 --> 21:55.099
It approximates the location of
the fracture on Dan’s forehead.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.772
The force could have cracked
his skull and killed him.

21:57.859 --> 22:00.100
Are you sure
nothing happened here?
One of your guys—

22:00.195 --> 22:02.561
they probably could have
hit Dan in practice
a little too hard,

22:02.655 --> 22:05.146
- try to cover it up.
- [ Coach]
What are you saying?

22:05.241 --> 22:07.357
You lose your insurance,
you’re kicked out
of the league, but, hey,

22:07.452 --> 22:09.408
it was just
an accident, right?

22:11.039 --> 22:13.701
I tell you what.
Anybody who’s got
plans for this weekend,

22:13.791 --> 22:15.656
- just cancel ’em.
- [ Players Muttering ]

22:15.752 --> 22:18.744
- [Man ] What are we, suspects?
- Because of blood
on a football helmet?

22:18.838 --> 22:21.375
Because of blood inside
of a football helmet.
Isn’t that right, Bones?

22:21.466 --> 22:24.629
That’s correct.

22:28.848 --> 22:33.137
I was draining the vat when
I noticed these white things
floating in the rhubarb stew.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.976
Spider eggs, right?
No.

22:36.064 --> 22:40.103
No, the boiling water
would have destroyed the eggs.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.610
[ Taps Keyboard]
So what are they?

22:43.696 --> 22:47.689
- lhave no idea.
- Always glad to sow confusion.

22:47.784 --> 22:51.868
This man endured
a remarkable amount of abuse.
It must have been tough.

22:51.955 --> 22:55.823
Yeah, this ain’t England, pal.
Being gay in America
is still a tough go.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.909
I was referring to being
a football player.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.419
Yeah, I-I knew that.

23:02.507 --> 23:06.170
Four years ago, Jared’s
girlfriend was a hooker?

23:06.261 --> 23:09.173
An escort. I believe,
in the hierarchy
of prostitution,

23:09.264 --> 23:12.222
an escort ranks equal
to high-class call girl.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.594
And now she teaches
grade school?

23:14.686 --> 23:16.222
Mm-hmm.

23:16.312 --> 23:20.100
I don’t see any other
injuries to the bone
that could be cause of death.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.523
That leads us back
to the head trauma.

23:22.610 --> 23:26.728
Apparently the rule is:
once a sex worker,
always a sex worker.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.690
You know, it really
would have been better
if Booth never ran her record.

23:29.784 --> 23:33.493
He said it was my influence,
that it was the rational
thing to do.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.162
No, sweetie,
he’s rationalizing.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.911
Which makes what he did
irrational because
he ’s rationalizing. ..

23:39.002 --> 23:42.335
that Jared cannot make
rational decisions
for himself.

23:42.422 --> 23:45.914
You do the same thing
all the time. Maybe that’s
what he learned from you.

23:46.009 --> 23:49.501
In order to be fatal, whatever
struck the frontal bone...

23:49.596 --> 23:52.087
had to be pointed enough
to pierce the brain.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.968
Now, wait a second.
ls Booth gonna tell
Jared about this?

23:55.101 --> 23:58.559
I believe that’s his plan.
What if Jared and this woman
are really in love?

23:58.646 --> 24:00.557
Booth could ruin everything.

24:00.648 --> 24:04.391
Well, not if, as Booth always
asserts, love conquers all.

24:04.485 --> 24:09.149
[ Scoffs ] Yeah,
well, this is gonna be
one hell of a test case.

24:09.365 --> 24:12.653
I ran blood tests on the items
in Dan’s athletic bag.

24:12.744 --> 24:15.611
I found evidence
of someone else’s blood.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.912
Football is a contact sport.
There are bound to be traces...

24:17.999 --> 24:20.035
of other people’s DNA.
on his uniform.

24:20.126 --> 24:24.415
This was more than a trace,
and it wasn’t on his uniform.
It was all over his towel.

24:24.505 --> 24:27.042
We ran it through CODIS
and got a match.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.044
Thirty-two-year—old man
named Cyd Zigler.

24:31.888 --> 24:34.755
Z/g/er is a ﬁreﬁghter
and a former marine.
He lives in Greenbelt, Mary/and

24:34.849 --> 24:38.216
He plays for one
of the other teams
in Dan’s league.

24:38.353 --> 24:40.594
One of the straight teams?
Yeah, it was a big game.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.430
Zigler fumbles,
the victim recovers,

24:43.524 --> 24:45.480
scores a touchdown—
game over.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.809
Well, I doubt even a homophobe
would kill for that.

24:47.945 --> 24:51.529
Yeah, but a fight ensues.
Oh, so they fought?

24:51.616 --> 24:55.529
If Dan won a physical altercation
in front of both teams,

24:59.791 --> 25:02.624
Go on.
Ca y guy beats up
a certain type of stra/ght guy,

25:02.752 --> 25:05.869
straight guy can’t handle it.
Well, see, that’s
what I wanted to know.

25:05.963 --> 25:10.002
Now, did the victim
and Zigler have any contact
since their fistfight?

25:10.093 --> 25:12.175
Well, the two of them—
they played against
each other...

25:12.261 --> 25:15.389
- in a game the weekend
before Dan disappeared.
- Okay.

25:15.473 --> 25:17.338
Jared.
Hey!

25:17.475 --> 25:19.841
Seeley, your message
sounded urgent. What’s going on?
Uh—

25:19.936 --> 25:21.892
Thanks for the gay insights.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.228
You’re welcome.

25:24.315 --> 25:27.557

- Okay.

25:27.652 --> 25:30.394
You got that big brother look
all over your face,

25:30.488 --> 25:33.195

to tell me the puppy
I brought home was a rat.

25:33.324 --> 25:35.235
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, right.

25:35.326 --> 25:39.239
Uh— Well, um,
it’s sort of happened again.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.037
Okay, what the hell
are you talking about?

25:42.125 --> 25:45.458
There are some things that
you need to know about Padme.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.378
You ran a background check
on my girlfriend?

25:49.465 --> 25:51.626
What? No. She was arrested
for prostitution four years ago.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.710
Shut up, Seeley. Shut it.

25:54.804 --> 25:57.511
The charges, they didn’t stick,
but you need to know
that she was an escort.

25:57.598 --> 26:00.431
- You just can’t stand
to see me happy, can you?
- No, that’s not true.

26:00.518 --> 26:03.351
If I were in your shoes,
I’d want to know if my
girlfriend was hiding something.

26:03.438 --> 26:06.646
No. You wouldn’t.
Okay?

26:06.733 --> 26:08.644
I have watched you for years.
I learned.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.943
You would make your own
judgment. You wouldn’t care
what other people said.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.361
You’d say exactly
what I’m gonna say.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.360
Go to hell.

[ On Speaker]
Look, / called him a fag.
The dude kicked my ass.

End of story.
You got a problem
with gays?

26:32.508 --> 26:35.750
No. That was over a year ago.
Look, what’s this all about?

26:35.845 --> 26:39.383
I’m trying to put together
a sequence of events
before Dan Pinard disappeared.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.637
Disappeared? Wh-Wh—
What do you mean, “disappeared”?

26:42.727 --> 26:46.470
We, uh, found your blood
on his towel.

26:46.564 --> 26:50.398
l-l cut myself during a game.
You know, big gash on my leg.

26:50.526 --> 26:53.939
Danny used his towel
to stop the bleeding.
What do you mean, “disappeared”?

26:54.030 --> 26:58.615
He came up to you in the
locker room and he presses
that towel on your leg?

26:58.701 --> 27:01.943
I thought—

27:02.038 --> 27:04.029
I thought it was only me.

27:05.166 --> 27:09.830
I thought Danny
didn’t want to see me anymore.

27:09.921 --> 27:15.291
And I-I called him.
I-I went by his place
a hundred times.

27:15.384 --> 27:16.715
Nothing.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.134
Hmm.

27:18.221 --> 27:21.304
Why do you think he didn’t
want to see you again?

27:21.390 --> 27:25.929
’Cause, I mean, Danny had it
all figured— who he was.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.056
I wasn’t ready.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.354
To come out of the closet.

27:32.735 --> 27:34.896
For any of it.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.978
That made Danny mad
sometimes, you know—

27:37.073 --> 27:39.189
frustrated.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.865
Is Danny dead?

27:45.581 --> 27:47.492
You, uh—

27:47.583 --> 27:49.539
You think I killed him.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.800
Danny was, uh—

27:59.887 --> 28:04.256
The only time I’ve ever
been happy was with Danny.

28:05.601 --> 28:08.934
I wouldn’t expect you
to understand.

28:09.021 --> 28:13.060
l— I don’t guess anyone
would understand.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.446
[ Hodgins ]
Mmm, looks l/ke
cause of death to me.

28:24.537 --> 28:27.028
Cause of death? Yes, yes,
but I cannot discern...

28:27.123 --> 28:29.785
the cause of the cause of death,
so to speak.

28:29.876 --> 28:33.084
Okay. Bugs and slime, pal—
different discipline
entirely. Sorry.

28:33.170 --> 28:37.209
There appear to be three
separate fractures on the skull.

28:37.300 --> 28:40.542
We couldn’t see them before
because all of the fracture lines
connect

28:40.636 --> 28:43.628
Okay, so the victim was hit
three times instead of once.

28:43.723 --> 28:47.511
Dr. Brennan thinks that
the brain was pierced
when the skull was hit.

28:47.602 --> 28:51.470
Brain piercing?
Yeah, sounds very
death-causing to me.

28:51.564 --> 28:54.476
The beveling on the exterior
of the skull...

28:54.567 --> 28:58.651
suggests that all three
fracture points emanate
from inside the skull.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.237
His forehead exploded
from the inside out.

29:02.325 --> 29:04.111
Again, very “deathy.”

29:04.201 --> 29:05.737
Wait a minute. What—

29:05.828 --> 29:09.366
What would cause
someone’s forehead
to explode from the inside?

29:09.457 --> 29:11.664
I was hoping that you’d say
it had something to do...

29:11.751 --> 29:14.458
with those bulbous seedy jobbers
that I thought were spider eggs.

29:14.545 --> 29:17.457
No. I mean—

29:20.009 --> 29:21.374
Wow.

29:24.055 --> 29:26.216
“WOW”?

29:26.307 --> 29:28.389
What “wow”?

29:28.476 --> 29:30.467
All right, so Zigler,
he was a marine.

29:30.561 --> 29:33.428
He gets married to a woman.
It lasts six years. Why?

29:33.564 --> 29:36.226
Why did his marriage
last six years?
No, why did he get married?

29:36.317 --> 29:39.104
Well, most likely Zigler
was trying to conform
to social norms.

29:39.195 --> 29:41.732
In many cultures,
homosexuality is revered.

29:41.864 --> 29:47.075
Anthropologically, it makes
no sense for heterosexuals
to be threatened by homosexuals...

29:47.161 --> 29:50.073
because they’re actually
removing themselves
from competition for mates.

29:50.164 --> 29:52.075
Right, so Zigler forces
himself to conform,

29:52.166 --> 29:55.624
then the dentist comes along
and forces, you know,
Zigler to confront.

29:55.711 --> 29:58.748
Zigler couldn’t come to terms
with his sexual orientation,

29:58.839 --> 30:02.423
so when the victim elicited this flood
of unwanted feelings in him,

30:02.510 --> 30:06.469
he transferred the self-loathing
from himself to the victim.

30:06.555 --> 30:10.264
Native Americans
believed that homosexuals
were of two spirits.

30:10.351 --> 30:13.184
Held them in high esteem.
So what’s the problem?

30:13.270 --> 30:15.761
[ Chuckles ]
It’s no problem. Why are you
looking at me like that?

30:15.856 --> 30:18.893
I was a soldier. I mean,
gay guys— they saved my life
in battle more than once.

30:18.985 --> 30:23.103
So, are you saying that
if a former prostitute
saved your life in battle,

30:23.197 --> 30:26.234
- that would solve the problem
with Jared’s girlfriend?
- What?

30:26.325 --> 30:28.407
Seriously, you’re gonna
bring that up in front
of Sweets right now?

30:28.494 --> 30:32.362
- It’s a rational question.
- I’m sorry. Jared’s involved
with a prostitute?

30:32.498 --> 30:34.329
Former. Former prostitute.
Bones.

30:34.417 --> 30:38.626
- What?
- Oh. Did you run a background
check on Jared’s girlfriend?

30:38.713 --> 30:41.796
Okay, why is everybody saying
that to me like it’s some sort
of terrible thing?

30:41.882 --> 30:44.794
- ’Cause it’s kind of terrible.
- I’m just looking out
for my brother. That’s all.

30:44.885 --> 30:47.422
So can we just, you know,
focus on the case?

30:49.432 --> 30:54.176
Yeah. Uh, well, the fact
that the suspect carries
in his wallet a photo...

30:54.270 --> 30:57.728

it doesn ’t real/y jibe
with homosexual panic.

Right. And yet, who do you turn to
when you need pretty pictures?

31:26.844 --> 31:30.507
Dr. Hodgins figured out
what caused the fracture
to the frontal bone.

31:30.598 --> 31:34.090
Vincent found these
small particulates floating
in the rhubarb stew, right?

31:34.185 --> 31:36.847
Well, lidentiﬂ'ed them
as silica phytolith,

31:36.937 --> 31:40.896
which is a razor-thin,
clear, hard shell
which protects seeds.

31:40.983 --> 31:45.272
Now, the victim was tossed
into the creek beo’, where
his body quick/y decomposed.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.569
Flooding from the rain
washed the clay and debris...

31:47.656 --> 31:49.692
into that creek bed,
which encased the body.

31:49.784 --> 31:52.025
Now, in all that muck,
three periwinkle seeds...

31:52.119 --> 31:54.781
became embedded within
the victim’s skull.

31:54.872 --> 31:57.238
- Okay.
- It’s called floral turbation.

31:57.333 --> 32:01.793
Over time,
soft can become
even harder than hard,

32:01.879 --> 32:04.746
like, uh, a sliver of grass
that grows through cement.

32:04.840 --> 32:09.254
The same kind of process
that causes tree roots
to destroy pipes.

32:09.345 --> 32:12.257
So, a seedling fractured
the frontal bone?

32:12.348 --> 32:14.509
Three of them.

32:16.852 --> 32:21.266
So, head trauma was not
cause of death.

cause of death.

So, according to
Grace Bryson’s statement,
she and her husband...

36:02.786 --> 36:05.277
were at a yoga retreat
when Dan Pinard disappeared.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.283
Well, the retreat
was in Silver Spring.

36:07.374 --> 36:10.912
That’s close enough
to drive back, kill Dan
and then return to the spa.

her and her husband.

You told me that my father’s

between us was real,
and that was all that mattered.

36:40.115 --> 36:44.905

my father and l have
a relationship today.

36:44.995 --> 36:46.951
Okay. I’m glad
I could help out.

so I’m just gonna be quiet now

told you where I was—
at the yoga retreat.

and return.

Well, I didn’t,
so can you leave me alone?

After Dan fired you,
you couldn’t find
a job, could you?

37:23.325 --> 37:25.782
Well, that wasn’t Dan’s fault.
That was the hepatitis.

37:25.869 --> 37:28.656
Ms. Bryson, do you own
a set of dental tools?

37:28.747 --> 37:32.035

when I was in school. Why?
- Can we see ’em?

Well, you know what?
These stones— they look...

37:54.940 --> 37:56.805
just like the ones
that were at Dan’s house.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.812
It’s the same contractor—
Lucas.

37:59.903 --> 38:02.485
I met him at Dan’s office
before I was fired.

38:02.573 --> 38:04.484
Well, he said he had
some extra materials...

38:04.575 --> 38:07.567
- left over from Dan’sjob
and he could give me a deal.
- That’s a scam.

38:07.661 --> 38:09.868
Lucas was reselling
the supplies that Dan
had already paid for.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.617
Well, I didn’t know that.

38:12.708 --> 38:15.916
Was Lucas working
on the driveway when you
were at the yoga retreat?

38:16.003 --> 38:19.791
Yeah. He was finished
by the time we got back.

38:19.882 --> 38:21.873
It was the fastest
he ever finished anything.

38:23.177 --> 38:25.589
- We need to dig these up.
- Backhoe and a cement cutter.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.510

are a match for the victim.

38:40.319 --> 38:44.062

Then it was paved over.

He used it for installing
the paving stones.
Coated in tungsten carbide.

- Please tell me it’s a match.
- It is, in fact, a perfect match...

to the victim’s ankle.

- Yeah.

- A vulgar slur for “homosexual”?

of the moment maybe.

heard what he was calling me.

and he started kicking me,

39:37.543 --> 39:40.876

and swung it at him
to get him off me.

In self-defense.
Yeah. Yeah, that’s it.

It was self-defense.

you didn’t call 911.

is correct.
