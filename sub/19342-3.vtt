WEBVTT

00:08.708 --> 00:10.667
Previously on  Billions...

00:10.667 --> 00:13.125
Rhoades' misconduct
is being investigated.

00:13.125 --> 00:15.834
I have nothing to hide.
You'll receive full cooperation.

00:15.834 --> 00:18.291
With it, without it,
I'll find out what's true.

00:18.291 --> 00:19.458
Know that.

00:19.458 --> 00:21.125
You broke
into my computer,

00:21.125 --> 00:24.000
opened my files,
and read my session notes.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.625
You stole the evidence
you needed.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.458
I thought I wanted to
bring you on full time,

00:27.458 --> 00:29.125
but now that I know
I can trust you,

00:29.125 --> 00:30.417
I'm certain I do.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.208
I'm going to war with Krakow
and Guangdong,

00:32.208 --> 00:33.750
and I need boots
on the ground.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.083
I want to crush this fuck.

00:35.083 --> 00:38.083
That glass --
it's not a barrier.

00:38.083 --> 00:41.209
It's an asset.
It's what makes you good.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.708
You see things
differently.

00:43.708 --> 00:45.084
That's an edge.

00:45.084 --> 00:49.084
The Attorney General's called me
down to Washington.

00:49.084 --> 00:50.333
She's gonna fire me.

00:50.333 --> 00:53.209
Take out an enemy,
a big, hard-to-kill one.

00:53.209 --> 00:55.250
It's tough to fire you then.

00:55.250 --> 00:58.417
I need to know
how to beat him.

00:58.417 --> 01:00.417
Will you help me?

01:00.417 --> 01:02.041
You have to be prepared
to do things

01:02.041 --> 01:04.041
that are entirely
outside the bounds

01:04.041 --> 01:06.875
of conventional morality.

01:12.667 --> 01:15.209
♪ ominous music plays ♪

01:26.000 --> 01:28.542
You know, the first time
I ever went to a game,

01:28.542 --> 01:30.209
I was in your box.

01:30.209 --> 01:32.042
So, you didn't grow up
with football?

01:32.042 --> 01:35.959
Oh, I did, but it was on
a 24-inch Trinitron knock-off.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.125
TV's great,
but you really miss out

01:40.125 --> 01:42.542
on being part of something
very special.

01:42.542 --> 01:44.417
Yeah, you do...

01:44.417 --> 01:46.291
which is why
I've been thinking

01:46.291 --> 01:48.667
about watching a few more games
in person.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.959
Bobby, I don't know where
you get your intel,

01:50.959 --> 01:52.166
but it's accurate.

01:52.166 --> 01:54.167
So that franchise
is  on the block.

01:54.167 --> 01:56.750
It's going to be announced
in the next couple of days.

01:56.750 --> 02:01.209
Well, when I become
an approved bidder,

02:01.209 --> 02:03.542
I hope I can count on
your support.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.125
Well, you can.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.708
But the hoops you have
to crawl through --

02:07.708 --> 02:08.834
they don't give a shit

02:08.834 --> 02:11.166
how many zeros
are in your bank account.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.084
I understand.

02:13.084 --> 02:14.708
Just trying to
figure out where --

02:14.708 --> 02:16.042
where my seat's gonna be.

02:16.042 --> 02:17.125
They're not gonna be here

02:17.125 --> 02:19.167
'cause my team's
not for sale, Bobby.

02:19.167 --> 02:20.167
Right.

02:30.291 --> 02:32.166
And how are the
children handling it

02:32.166 --> 02:34.500
on the nights
you actually switch?

02:34.500 --> 02:35.917
-Fine.
-Not very well.

02:37.333 --> 02:40.167
Kevin is still on
about that vows thing.

02:40.167 --> 02:42.000
He brought
that up again?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.250
Yeah. Not directly,
but, uh, yeah.

02:45.250 --> 02:49.708
Right after we split, uh,
in a moment of anger,

02:49.708 --> 02:52.375
Kevin turned to me
and he said, uh,

02:52.375 --> 02:54.083
"I thought 'vow'
meant 'promise.'"

02:54.083 --> 02:56.209
We started him in therapy
the next week

02:56.209 --> 02:57.333
and started coming here.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.959
Yeah, well, anyway, he crawled
in my bed last night

02:59.959 --> 03:01.583
and asked me
to make vows with him.

03:01.583 --> 03:03.458
Did he have something
specific in mind?

03:03.458 --> 03:04.834
It was a list.

03:04.834 --> 03:08.583
First he asked me to vow...

03:08.583 --> 03:10.208
never to leave him.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.542
And then he wanted me
to vow

03:14.542 --> 03:18.167
to get you and me
back together.

03:18.167 --> 03:20.042
What did you say?

03:21.583 --> 03:25.125
I said that Mommy and Daddy were
trying to work things out...

03:25.125 --> 03:28.291
and that, while I can't promise
that they will,

03:28.291 --> 03:31.708
I can promise that we
will always love him and Eva,

03:31.708 --> 03:34.209
that we will always
put them first.

03:36.125 --> 03:39.083
And that's my
most sacred vow.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.000
He's a really good dad.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.084
Tell him that.

03:50.083 --> 03:54.167
Chuck,
you're a really good dad.

03:54.167 --> 03:58.041
You're a really good mom.

03:58.041 --> 04:00.291
Not every couple can do that,

04:00.291 --> 04:04.834
recognize each other in the
midst of anger and uncertainty.

04:04.834 --> 04:06.917
That's intimacy.

04:06.917 --> 04:09.417
Let's see if we can keep
that going.

04:09.417 --> 04:13.042
- What else is on your minds?
- -Money.

04:13.042 --> 04:14.625
The Yale Club
is kind of steep.

04:14.625 --> 04:17.208
And we had talked about sharing
a satellite apartment.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.708
I'm fine at my sister's,

04:18.708 --> 04:21.500
but I think it makes sense
for you to get your own place.

04:23.708 --> 04:25.417
Uh-huh.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.125
Really, it's hard
not to notice

04:30.125 --> 04:32.583
the shrink sorority
eye-lock thing.

04:32.583 --> 04:35.084
Chuck, this is not
a conspiracy.

04:35.084 --> 04:37.042
I don't want
to speak for Wendy.

04:37.042 --> 04:39.125
I'll just say
it felt like you had

04:39.125 --> 04:42.291
an emotional response
that you didn't share.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.042
Signing a lease...

04:48.042 --> 04:50.291
is a commitment.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.917
Do you mean financial?
Do you mean --

04:52.917 --> 04:55.583
I had hoped
that this separation

04:55.583 --> 04:58.250
wouldn't be permanent enough
that it would entail

04:58.250 --> 05:00.667
references
and credit checks

05:00.667 --> 05:04.625
and outlaying security payments,
but it'll be fine.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.375
You know, I guess I'll just,
uh, sell something.

05:07.375 --> 05:10.417
Chuck, you've got to accept
the new reality.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.166
This runs deep,

05:13.166 --> 05:15.750
really fucking deep.

05:18.708 --> 05:21.291
I understand.

05:21.291 --> 05:23.917
And that's intimacy, too.

05:23.917 --> 05:26.125
It's just harder to hear.

05:27.583 --> 05:31.209
-You been on Twitter today?
-Assume I haven't.

05:31.209 --> 05:32.917
Krakow tweeted,
"Looking forward

05:32.917 --> 05:35.083
to kicking major
Axe Capital ass again

05:35.083 --> 05:38.000
in Hold 'em tomorrow night,
#alphacup."

05:38.000 --> 05:39.875
It's fucking trending
in New York.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.208
Don't respond.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.917
If he wants to
pop off online

05:42.917 --> 05:44.917
while using the squatty potty,
let him.

05:44.917 --> 05:46.917
We'll do our talking
at the table.

05:46.917 --> 05:50.000
His team has outlasted ours four
out of the last five years.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.208
He's a good fucking
card player -- great, even.

05:52.208 --> 05:54.333
Phil Laak calls
Krakow a wizard,

05:54.333 --> 05:57.083
says he can GTO-grind
a man into a nub.

05:57.083 --> 05:58.959
How'd you like to go work
for him?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.125
No, thank you, sir.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.375
Respectfully, delicately,

06:02.375 --> 06:05.250
regretfully...

06:05.250 --> 06:06.959
he's better than you.

06:06.959 --> 06:08.333
I see that.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.291
Head-to-head,
he is better.

06:10.291 --> 06:12.208
So, we don't play?

06:12.208 --> 06:15.000
No. We reduce his edge.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.125
Is this, um --

06:18.125 --> 06:20.125
is this last night's
or this morning's?

06:20.125 --> 06:23.209
What if I don't want
to answer?

06:23.209 --> 06:26.291
Well, maybe shower before
heading to the office.

06:26.291 --> 06:28.417
I already did.

06:28.417 --> 06:31.625
Well, I'm thinking
maybe you hit it again.

06:41.083 --> 06:42.959
Heard Tisch
will support your bid.

06:42.959 --> 06:44.458
Seems likely.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.834
I wish I could be in there
negotiating for you.

06:46.834 --> 06:49.375
We handled the M&A work
for the last two team sales.

06:49.375 --> 06:52.000
Well, that's what Chuck Rhoades
will do to a man --

06:52.000 --> 06:53.250
rob him of his life's work.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.708
He's a Stalinist --

06:54.708 --> 06:56.500
convict first,
then have the trial.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.375
He hasn't even
indicted anyone

06:58.375 --> 07:00.583
at my firm
or subpoenaed documents,

07:00.583 --> 07:03.042
just allowed the leak,
the insinuations,

07:03.042 --> 07:05.042
the idea
to fester in the minds

07:05.042 --> 07:07.042
of the public
that we're dirty.

07:07.042 --> 07:11.125
As a tactician,
I admire it.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.792
As the target of it --

07:12.792 --> 07:14.542
Old days when the man
with the badge

07:14.542 --> 07:16.000
used it
for his own purposes,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.875
instead of to benefit
the township?

07:17.875 --> 07:20.083
That man ended up on
the wrong end of a noose...

07:20.083 --> 07:21.417
Yeah.

07:21.417 --> 07:23.125
...but not before
he got a fuck

07:23.125 --> 07:25.000
of a lot of his own hanging
done first.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.209
Well, then,
we better make sure

07:27.209 --> 07:29.708
we burn the gallows down
before he gets to you.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.333
- Is he prepared?
- Yeah.

07:45.333 --> 07:48.000
He's ready to do
whatever he has to.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.917
I look forward
to meeting him, then.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.000
Anything come from
the surveillance yet?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.042
Rhoades is not exploitable
at this moment.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.792
-No openings.
-Find one.

07:57.792 --> 08:01.125
Hall, I hear his name
in my sleep

08:01.125 --> 08:03.959
and underneath
every thought I have.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.166
It's always running.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.000
It's like
the fucking Lord's Prayer.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.250
Find one.

08:11.084 --> 08:14.000
Is there some kind of
a prop bet going on here?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.208
First one to mention
Lawrence Boyd

08:17.208 --> 08:19.333
has to buy everyone else
cotton candy?

08:19.333 --> 08:21.417
There's just nothing
to say, boss.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.834
Really?

08:22.834 --> 08:25.000
Nothing that isn't
speculative at best.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.084
It's crunch time,

08:27.084 --> 08:29.167
and Connerty's
pulling a Scottie Pippen.

08:29.167 --> 08:31.000
What, do you got
a migraine, Bryan?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.583
Come on, Chuck.
That's not fair...

08:32.583 --> 08:34.125
to Pippen.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.000
The man had just suffered
a personal loss.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.166
I don't give a shit.
Lonnie, how about you?

08:38.166 --> 08:40.917
I started a deep dive into
their inversion practices.

08:40.917 --> 08:42.959
They keep so much cash
stashed overseas,

08:42.959 --> 08:45.417
I figured there's got to be
some tax irregularities.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.208
And were there?

08:48.042 --> 08:51.625
So, there's nothing on Boyd
and company churning accounts?

08:51.625 --> 08:54.708
On, uh, advising retirees
against their interests

08:54.708 --> 08:57.166
or subprime mortgages
making a comeback?

08:57.166 --> 08:59.708
How about hookers
for foreign clients?

08:59.708 --> 09:02.417
You're telling me there is
nothing  of which to speak?

09:02.417 --> 09:04.333
Not as of yet.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.583
I found something.

09:07.583 --> 09:10.084
Please.

09:12.209 --> 09:13.375
A couple of months ago,

09:13.375 --> 09:15.875
a flight attendant
on the Spartan-Ives jet

09:15.875 --> 09:18.084
made a small trade
ahead of a merger,

09:18.084 --> 09:20.166
turned a $24,000 profit.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.417
She overheard something.

09:22.417 --> 09:25.125
No benefit was exchanged.
There's no crime.

09:25.125 --> 09:28.000
I know that.
You know that.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.084
We went to law school.

09:30.084 --> 09:31.166
She didn't.

09:31.166 --> 09:33.209
Work this.

09:33.209 --> 09:35.041
- Work it with her.
- Come on.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.500
How many dots do you figure

09:37.500 --> 09:40.083
between a flight attendant
and Lawrence Boyd?

09:40.083 --> 09:42.291
You'll let me know.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.042
Or maybe you won't.

09:50.667 --> 09:53.042
Is there an implication
in that?

09:53.042 --> 09:55.083
Yeah.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.708
There is.

10:06.875 --> 10:08.834
What is the Alpha Cup?

10:08.834 --> 10:10.834
Wall Street charity
poker tournament.

10:10.834 --> 10:12.417
The winner gets
to donate the pot

10:12.417 --> 10:14.167
to the charity
of their choice.

10:14.167 --> 10:15.708
It's like $15 million.

10:15.708 --> 10:16.750
Oh.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.667
Why are you asking
about the Alpha Cup?

10:18.667 --> 10:20.458
Because Axe
invited me to play

10:20.458 --> 10:22.875
in the firm's other seat
along with him.

10:22.875 --> 10:26.125
Oh, this is fucking bullshit!

10:26.125 --> 10:28.167
Turn the fuck away.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.167
That's my  fucking seat.

10:34.041 --> 10:36.084
I'm pretty sure
it's my  fucking seat.

10:36.084 --> 10:37.041
I paid for it.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.166
I can award it to
whomever the fuck I want.

10:39.166 --> 10:41.959
Axe, I've been your wingman
for the past three years.

10:41.959 --> 10:44.125
I've been close to
the final table every time.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.125
Yeah, which is
another way of saying

10:46.125 --> 10:48.250
you missed the final table
three years running.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.125
You know one of the things that
I really like about the NFL?

10:53.125 --> 10:54.667
The cheerleaders?

10:54.667 --> 10:56.875
Uh, yeah, yeah,
when I was 12, yeah.

10:56.875 --> 11:00.959
But I'm all grown now, so I was
gonna say the contracts.

11:00.959 --> 11:03.750
No other league gives
fewer guarantees.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.417
You can sign for seven years,
$120 million.

11:06.417 --> 11:08.708
Yet you shit the bed,

11:08.708 --> 11:10.084
they cut you
in the spring,

11:10.084 --> 11:11.959
you're back knocking
on doors again.

11:11.959 --> 11:13.125
So you're
cutting me loose.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.250
Well, I wouldn't say it
that way, but yes.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.750
For that  little--

11:16.750 --> 11:17.834
Hey.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.625
For Taylor?

11:22.834 --> 11:24.458
Everything
I measure myself by

11:24.458 --> 11:26.083
has been called
into question.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.125
Todd.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.250
This is for you...

11:39.583 --> 11:41.542
...by way of an apology

11:41.542 --> 11:43.750
for putting you
in an awkward position.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.000
Do I really look
like I need

11:53.000 --> 11:54.792
$5,000 worth
of spa treatments?

11:54.792 --> 11:56.959
You look like
you wouldn't give yourself

11:56.959 --> 11:58.917
the gift of peace of mind,
so I did.

11:58.917 --> 12:00.583
So you're my personal
Dalai Lama?

12:00.583 --> 12:03.375
I did spend part of last summer
in the company of Rinpoche.

12:03.375 --> 12:06.125
You know, I could actually
introduce you, if you want.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.708
Why are you here?

12:08.708 --> 12:11.291
I'm playing in the Alpha Cup
tomorrow night.

12:11.291 --> 12:13.667
Ah.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.792
It's that time of year.

12:15.792 --> 12:18.708
It is, and I'd like you to come,
as my coach.

12:18.708 --> 12:20.667
I'll pay you very well
for your time.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.167
No. We've done
this dance before.

12:23.167 --> 12:25.000
You're gonna want insight
into Axe or --

12:25.000 --> 12:27.875
There are lots of villains
at the tournament tomorrow.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.708
Axe is only one.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.250
Look, I want to perform
at my best.

12:32.250 --> 12:35.000
And like you said, it's scary
when you feel the pressure.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.333
I can admit that.

12:42.708 --> 12:43.834
I'm reluctant.

12:43.834 --> 12:46.000
I am offering you
a challenge

12:46.000 --> 12:49.125
and a chance to redefine
yourself in the industry...

12:49.125 --> 12:50.375
as independent,

12:50.375 --> 12:53.041
separate from Axe
in every way.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.917
All the top funds will see you
as a resource,

12:55.917 --> 12:57.041
not as his accoutrement.

12:57.041 --> 12:58.500
If you thought I were that,

12:58.500 --> 13:00.708
you would never have come
through that door.

13:00.708 --> 13:01.625
I know you're not,

13:01.625 --> 13:03.125
because I'm me,

13:03.125 --> 13:06.000
but we both know we don't work
in a rational business.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.125
You never hear "no," do you?

13:08.125 --> 13:11.167
The word is said in my vicinity
on occasion,

13:11.167 --> 13:13.917
but somehow it never
really lands on me.

13:13.917 --> 13:15.959
It's clear to me
that if there were

13:15.959 --> 13:18.000
any ethically compromised
behavior,

13:18.000 --> 13:19.458
you weren't
in the middle of it.

13:19.458 --> 13:23.083
Glad as I am to be seen,
how do you know?

13:23.083 --> 13:26.125
One --
I have never come across

13:26.125 --> 13:28.500
a more meticulous
written accounting

13:28.500 --> 13:31.500
of a lawyer's conversations
and interactions than yours.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.042
I... don't know how
you find the time.

13:34.042 --> 13:36.291
Not much of a social life.

13:36.291 --> 13:40.209
And two -- you were the only
person in this office

13:40.209 --> 13:43.167
who noticed and removed
a compromised employee.

13:43.167 --> 13:46.208
You sat on the honor committee
at Princeton.

13:46.208 --> 13:49.917
You are not  in this to get
caught up in some scandal.

13:49.917 --> 13:52.875
In other words,
like recognizes like.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.125
But someone as...

13:58.125 --> 14:00.500
keenly sensitive as you

14:00.500 --> 14:03.084
must have noticed
the vibrations,

14:03.084 --> 14:06.291
if not the actual sonic boom,
of impropriety.

14:06.291 --> 14:09.208
I have not.

14:09.208 --> 14:12.250
If any of that was happening,
I wasn't privy.

14:12.250 --> 14:15.291
Uh-huh.

14:15.291 --> 14:18.000
Thank you, Ms. Sacker.

14:23.375 --> 14:26.250
I appreciate the offer,
but I can't play.

14:26.250 --> 14:29.167
Is that the right word --
"can't"?

14:29.167 --> 14:31.042
I'd prefer not to.

14:31.042 --> 14:33.667
But you do know how?

14:33.667 --> 14:35.250
What was your screen name?

14:35.250 --> 14:37.625
Why do you assume
I had one?

14:37.625 --> 14:39.166
Your age, skill set,

14:39.166 --> 14:41.750
the fact that everyone here
had one...

14:41.750 --> 14:44.792
and that you had a lot of nights
in high school

14:44.792 --> 14:47.042
when all the other kids
were either

14:47.042 --> 14:48.000
stuck on their homework

14:48.000 --> 14:50.041
or hanging out
under the bridge vaping.

14:50.041 --> 14:53.375
ZachCody892.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.291
I was 12 when I started
playing online.

14:55.291 --> 14:58.458
I bet you were one of those
multi-table prodigies.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.750
Sixteen at a time.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.166
But then I quit poker.

15:02.166 --> 15:05.084
Around the time
you went to college?

15:05.084 --> 15:06.250
Black Friday?

15:06.250 --> 15:08.250
I started playing live
for the first time

15:08.250 --> 15:11.917
against classmates,
grad students, professors.

15:11.917 --> 15:14.166
Oh, so you had to adjust
to the different speed,

15:14.166 --> 15:16.042
different
informational fields.

15:16.042 --> 15:18.750
Yeah,
I -- I did fine live,

15:18.750 --> 15:20.667
but then just moved on
to other things.

15:20.667 --> 15:23.000
Moved on?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.917
The whole "my dick is bigger
than yours" thing,

15:25.917 --> 15:27.500
it wasn't for me.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.750
You already knew...

15:33.750 --> 15:36.000
about my entire
player history.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.291
That wasn't a guess.

15:37.291 --> 15:40.625
Look...

15:40.625 --> 15:43.333
I need to win this thing.

15:43.333 --> 15:46.000
I put somebody on it
early this morning.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I had a feeling,
pulled your résumé...

15:48.000 --> 15:52.209
saw some game-theory
strengths...

15:52.209 --> 15:56.167
looked into it
a little bit more.

15:56.167 --> 15:58.250
How'd you clock
that I knew?

15:58.250 --> 16:01.125
The way you listened
to my answers,

16:01.125 --> 16:02.291
the cant of your head.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.750
You weren't receiving
new information.

16:04.750 --> 16:07.458
Can I convince you...

16:07.458 --> 16:12.209
to try one more time
to play?

16:12.209 --> 16:14.875
I'd prefer not to.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.041
That kind of competition
made me sick.

16:17.041 --> 16:19.875
It literally brought on feelings
of malaise.

16:19.875 --> 16:22.209
Okay.

16:23.667 --> 16:26.125
Okay.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.042
So, Michaela,
the following facts

16:28.042 --> 16:29.542
have come to light.

16:29.542 --> 16:32.083
You have no history
of investing in securities,

16:32.083 --> 16:33.333
but on April 8th,

16:33.333 --> 16:35.084
you invested
your entire savings,

16:35.084 --> 16:36.959
$117,000,

16:36.959 --> 16:40.500
in Dassan International
Potash stock...

16:40.500 --> 16:44.208
two days ahead of a merger
that caused shares to rise.

16:44.208 --> 16:47.750
Now, are you some kind
of potash expert?

16:47.750 --> 16:49.458
No.

16:49.458 --> 16:52.208
Just a potash enthusiast?

16:52.208 --> 16:54.083
What?

16:54.083 --> 16:56.708
I'm sorry.

16:56.708 --> 16:58.792
You're actually
the flight attendant

16:58.792 --> 17:01.834
on the corporate jet of the bank
that financed the merger.

17:01.834 --> 17:04.875
You're making it sound like
I did something --

17:04.875 --> 17:07.750
She's making it sound like
I did something wrong.

17:07.750 --> 17:11.209
I thought I was being smart
for a change.

17:11.209 --> 17:13.792
You do know trading
on inside information

17:13.792 --> 17:16.792
is a crime punishable by fine
and imprisonment?

17:16.792 --> 17:19.250
We're talking about jail?

17:19.250 --> 17:23.500
Um, I'm not sure I should be
sitting here alone.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.542
Time to get Sacker
out of there.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.542
Well, if you feel that
you've done nothing wrong,

17:32.542 --> 17:34.000
you should be --

17:34.000 --> 17:35.375
I'm sorry to interrupt.

17:35.375 --> 17:38.417
Uh, Ms. Sacker, you are needed
in Mr. Rhoades' office.

17:38.417 --> 17:40.125
It's urgent.

17:50.708 --> 17:54.167
I just wanted to...
buy an apartment.

17:58.417 --> 18:01.250
Believe me, I get it.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.583
Things are stacked against us
in this city.

18:08.583 --> 18:11.209
Can you tell me
this will all be okay?

18:11.209 --> 18:15.959
Michaela, I-I know you didn't
mean to do anything wrong.

18:15.959 --> 18:20.125
My colleague --
Ms. Sacker --

18:20.125 --> 18:23.208
she's got a very brass-tacks way
of looking at this stuff.

18:23.208 --> 18:27.000
She doesn't see
other factors...

18:27.000 --> 18:29.500
that good people
can step wrong.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.084
I think I know
how to help you.

18:34.084 --> 18:35.625
But won't she --

18:35.625 --> 18:37.625
No. I'm her superior.

18:37.625 --> 18:41.000
You give me
your cooperation,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.083
I will give you
my protection.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.959
And like Earl Anthony

18:44.959 --> 18:48.166
bagging the 7-10 split.

18:48.166 --> 18:51.000
You will?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.291
I will.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.875
We have a real
opportunity here.

18:54.875 --> 18:57.208
If Boyd still feels
safe anywhere,

18:57.208 --> 19:00.000
it's on his Falcon,
his flying cocoon.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
And we need to be there
when he lets down his guard.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.166
Sacker, Connerty's gonna be
the lead on this,

19:06.166 --> 19:08.375
not because I don't have
confidence in you.

19:08.375 --> 19:10.208
Bryan has a particular set
of skills,

19:10.208 --> 19:12.209
skills acquired
over a long career,

19:12.209 --> 19:13.542
skills that make him --

19:13.542 --> 19:15.750
The object of a stewardess's
desperate lust.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.792
--Congratulations.

19:17.792 --> 19:20.667
Where are you registered?
I hope you like cake servers.

19:20.667 --> 19:23.209
I'll go get the SEC file.

19:30.042 --> 19:31.708
Hey.

19:31.708 --> 19:34.041
Oh, wow.

19:34.041 --> 19:36.167
My God, the kids
are gonna love that.

19:36.167 --> 19:37.583
Yeah.

19:39.834 --> 19:41.750
Bach, good.

19:41.750 --> 19:45.042
I need names,
for a friend.

19:45.042 --> 19:47.166
Yeah. I need a lawyer,
absolute killer,

19:47.166 --> 19:51.291
the one you'd use if you
couldn't be your own.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.708
I already did.
Thanks.

19:54.667 --> 19:57.750
Was that about
Lawrence Boyd?

19:57.750 --> 19:59.625
Yeah.

19:59.625 --> 20:01.458
Why you going deep
for him?

20:03.209 --> 20:04.250
He asked.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.042
A lot of people ask you

20:08.042 --> 20:11.000
to use your influence
and resources every day.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.125
You don't always say yes.

20:12.125 --> 20:14.750
I don't like the idea
of Boyd going down.

20:14.750 --> 20:18.042
It doesn't --
doesn't sit right with me.

20:20.291 --> 20:22.792
That's a good answer.

20:22.792 --> 20:25.708
I believe it,
but it's not the whole answer.

20:25.708 --> 20:27.625
You never give anyone
your playbook,

20:27.625 --> 20:30.083
no matter how much you're
rooting for them to win.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.875
It's like this --

20:32.875 --> 20:35.417
Rhoades' attack on Boyd
is very public.

20:35.417 --> 20:36.875
It's very loud.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.834
If Rhoades wins,
he gets stronger.

20:38.834 --> 20:41.708
If he loses,
he's defanged.

20:42.834 --> 20:45.417
Getting there.

20:45.417 --> 20:46.708
And if we'd just met,

20:46.708 --> 20:49.250
I would believe that that
was the whole thing.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.333
The rest is strategy.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.708
It's tactics.

20:54.708 --> 20:57.417
If Boyd is convicted,
I'll be on the inside.

20:57.417 --> 20:59.750
I'll understand what works,
what doesn't.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.875
He's like a soldier.
We send him up front.

21:01.875 --> 21:03.167
He's a scout.

21:03.167 --> 21:05.875
He brings back intel,
or he becomes cannon fodder,

21:05.875 --> 21:08.000
and that brings
a different kind of intel

21:08.000 --> 21:11.834
about where we can step
and where we can't.

21:11.834 --> 21:15.750
Lawrence Boyd isn't
exactly cannon fodder.

21:18.917 --> 21:21.000
Babe...

21:21.000 --> 21:23.875
everyone in the world,
apart from you, me,

21:23.875 --> 21:27.458
and the kids
is cannon fodder.

21:38.667 --> 21:41.417
I'm sorry.
I have to deal with something.

21:41.417 --> 21:43.417
See you upstairs
in a minute?

21:43.417 --> 21:44.750
Okay.

22:25.708 --> 22:28.083
You're playing
in the Alpha Cup.

22:28.083 --> 22:31.125
It'll do you good --
and me.

22:31.125 --> 22:34.750
Consider it a part of those
168 hours you promised.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.583
I can't promise results.

22:36.583 --> 22:38.917
Competition doesn't bring out
my best.

22:38.917 --> 22:40.959
Make a session
with Dr. Gus.

22:40.959 --> 22:43.291
Maybe he'll help you
with the competition piece.

22:43.291 --> 22:45.125
Okay.

22:53.625 --> 22:56.500
If Bryan lands
this case, I think Crim is his.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.166
But that case could just
as easily break him.

22:59.166 --> 23:02.458
Lonnie is taking the surer,
steadier route.

23:02.458 --> 23:04.583
I was gonna ask which way
you were leaning,

23:04.583 --> 23:06.291
but you seem almost
equally swayed.

23:09.084 --> 23:10.792
Bryan has always
expected it...

23:10.792 --> 23:12.208
and worked for it

23:12.208 --> 23:14.792
and Chuck like nothing else
in the world mattered.

23:14.792 --> 23:16.917
And lately he's...

23:16.917 --> 23:19.500
It feels like if this goes
the other way

23:19.500 --> 23:21.000
and he gets passed over,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.708
his entire purpose is called
into question.

23:23.708 --> 23:26.417
Meanwhile,
Lonnie has been sent away,

23:26.417 --> 23:29.834
called back, and never
let it derail him.

23:29.834 --> 23:31.000
He's dogged.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.042
And none of this
is being colored

23:33.042 --> 23:35.042
by your personal connection
to Bryan?

23:35.042 --> 23:37.417
In the past.

23:37.417 --> 23:41.083
This is an advisory
conversation, not "Loveline."

23:41.083 --> 23:45.167
Then you should think
about yourself

23:45.167 --> 23:47.041
and the ways in which
you could contribute,

23:47.041 --> 23:49.084
given more influence,
more control,

23:49.084 --> 23:51.084
more access
to decision making.

23:51.084 --> 23:52.375
You're right.

23:52.375 --> 23:54.083
Rhoades won't make you
head of Crim,

23:54.083 --> 23:56.084
but his successor may.

23:56.084 --> 23:58.583
Whoever gets it
will need a deputy.

23:58.583 --> 23:59.959
That's true.

23:59.959 --> 24:02.708
They say you can't ride
two horses with one behind,

24:02.708 --> 24:05.333
but in today's business world,
it's a smart move,

24:05.333 --> 24:07.209
as long as you're
up-front about it

24:07.209 --> 24:08.667
so no one can accuse you

24:08.667 --> 24:11.209
of being disloyal,
only intelligent.

24:11.209 --> 24:14.042
Still pretty sharp
for an old dog.

24:14.042 --> 24:15.792
Thanks, Dad.

24:15.792 --> 24:18.375
So, you're saying that
you won most of the time,

24:18.375 --> 24:20.834
but it made you sad
to beat your fellow students

24:20.834 --> 24:23.667
in this...college game?

24:23.667 --> 24:25.166
Yes.

24:25.166 --> 24:28.042
But they're losers.

24:28.042 --> 24:29.750
I have to tell you,

24:29.750 --> 24:33.042
I've had 927 hours
of therapy.

24:33.042 --> 24:36.083
And that's supposed to make me
sit back on my heels?

24:36.083 --> 24:37.708
Not at all.

24:37.708 --> 24:39.959
It's supposed to give you
useful information

24:39.959 --> 24:41.708
to make this session
more productive,

24:41.708 --> 24:43.291
to save you from
using techniques

24:43.291 --> 24:45.209
that I might have
already parried.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.500
One -- this isn't therapy.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.208
Two -- I've had more fucking
therapy than you have.

24:53.208 --> 24:56.667
And three --
every time you walk away

24:56.667 --> 24:58.917
from doing
what makes you feel great,

24:58.917 --> 25:02.375
even though it also
makes you feel sad...

25:02.375 --> 25:06.083
something inside
of you dies.

25:08.417 --> 25:10.250
That's true.

25:10.250 --> 25:12.209
Instead...

25:13.458 --> 25:16.125
...when you feel
emotionally messy,

25:16.125 --> 25:19.084
take yourself to where
the boundaries are clean.

25:19.084 --> 25:21.792
It's effective.

25:21.792 --> 25:24.458
It's why we've developed
sex workers.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.458
Okay.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.542
Thanks for your time.

25:34.125 --> 25:37.000
--You sure, Chuck?

25:38.542 --> 25:40.250
Oh, I have to.

25:40.250 --> 25:42.917
The Churchill World War II --
it's a hell of a set.

25:42.917 --> 25:45.500
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm very happy to have it.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.166
I'm sure I'll do very well
with it,

25:47.166 --> 25:49.667
but I remember how long
you worked on this.

25:49.667 --> 25:51.000
Well, maybe
I can circle back

25:51.000 --> 25:52.834
and grab them
before they're gone.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.834
If somebody comes in,
I have to sell them.

25:56.834 --> 26:00.458
But, you know, a specialty item
like this, at this price,

26:00.458 --> 26:03.250
they'll probably be sold at
the Antiquarian Fair in April,

26:03.250 --> 26:05.792
so, if you do come back,

26:05.792 --> 26:09.084
I'll give it to you
at the carrying cost, okay?

26:13.834 --> 26:17.875
"Dear Monty,
never give in,

26:17.875 --> 26:21.625
never give in,
never, never, never,

26:21.625 --> 26:25.375
in nothing,
great or small,

26:25.375 --> 26:27.917
large or petty.

26:27.917 --> 26:29.208
Never give in

26:29.208 --> 26:33.417
except to convictions of honor
and good sense.

26:36.042 --> 26:39.667
And never yield to force.

26:39.667 --> 26:43.500
And never yield to the
apparently overwhelming might

26:43.500 --> 26:46.084
of the enemy."

26:47.333 --> 26:50.167
From the day
I passed the bar,

26:50.167 --> 26:52.375
I have said those words
to myself

26:52.375 --> 26:54.792
the first morning
of every trial.

26:56.167 --> 26:58.166
You can still say
the words.

27:13.375 --> 27:15.333
Thank you, Harry.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.167
This is tricky.

27:34.167 --> 27:37.500
There's nowhere to hide it
in plain sight.

27:37.500 --> 27:40.000
So, what do you suggest?

27:40.000 --> 27:43.042
A band on the upper thigh,
I think.

27:43.042 --> 27:44.333
Do it.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Yeah, so...

27:52.000 --> 27:54.042
right leg, left leg?

27:54.042 --> 27:55.500
You got a preference?

27:55.500 --> 27:57.208
Um...

27:57.208 --> 28:00.209
I'm sorry.
This is really, uh...

28:00.209 --> 28:02.042
Could you give me
a second?

28:07.875 --> 28:10.209
Actually, could you  stay?

28:11.083 --> 28:12.959
Yeah.

28:14.542 --> 28:16.959
Sorry. I-I didn't
feel comfortable --

28:16.959 --> 28:18.375
I understand.

28:18.375 --> 28:20.417
Um...

28:20.417 --> 28:24.084
do you know
how to do this?

28:24.084 --> 28:28.500
Some parts of the job
are pretty intuitive.

28:45.041 --> 28:48.000
Um, I can take it
from here.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.375
How does it look?

29:01.792 --> 29:03.125
Passable.

29:04.583 --> 29:05.959

30:35.959 --> 30:38.750

30:47.291 --> 30:49.333

30:49.333 --> 30:51.875

30:51.875 --> 30:53.125
but when I do it,

30:53.125 --> 30:55.792
it's an expression
of profound sentiment.

30:55.792 --> 30:57.875
You know my performance
coach, right?

30:57.875 --> 30:59.417
Glad you could pitch in.

30:59.417 --> 31:01.167

he can get.

31:01.167 --> 31:02.625

36:26.000 --> 36:27.583
but pissed off.

36:27.583 --> 36:30.792
Gentlemen, flip
your cards up, please.

36:32.166 --> 36:33.708
Ooh, top two pair.

36:35.458 --> 36:37.959
Unfortunately,
I've got these babies.

36:43.458 --> 36:46.333
You went set-mining
against me.

36:46.333 --> 36:48.708
I knew if you'd hit,
I'd felt you

36:48.708 --> 36:51.208
because you underestimate
my strength.

36:51.208 --> 36:52.500
It's who you are.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.625
Well-played, Todd.

36:54.625 --> 36:57.792
You trying to jinx me now
that you got four outs left?

37:00.083 --> 37:01.792
Let's see the river.

37:05.333 --> 37:06.458
Yes!

37:09.959 --> 37:11.542
That's what
I'm talking about!

37:11.542 --> 37:13.250
-Yeah!
-Ah!

37:13.250 --> 37:15.209
You owe me half a stick.

37:18.333 --> 37:19.542
So good.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.417
We done betting?

37:24.417 --> 37:26.500
The tournament's
still going on.

37:26.500 --> 37:30.042
How about...

37:32.542 --> 37:34.000
...we double the wager

37:34.000 --> 37:36.708

outlasting yours?

37:36.708 --> 37:40.250
Well, if it was Dollar Bill,
I'd take it in a heartbeat,

37:40.250 --> 37:42.583
but he's over there
with his thumb up his ass.

37:46.084 --> 37:48.209
Who do you have?

37:51.583 --> 37:53.083
Really?

37:53.083 --> 37:54.625
That?

37:56.917 --> 37:59.125
And you want
to double it?

37:59.125 --> 38:00.834
All or nothing.

38:00.834 --> 38:03.000

back from the powder room,

38:07.000 --> 38:08.875

out of here.

38:08.875 --> 38:10.708
Take care of our boy.

38:10.708 --> 38:12.834
Ah.

38:12.834 --> 38:15.750
I would normally volunteer
to be his bodyguard,

38:15.750 --> 38:18.750

and go to work?

38:26.834 --> 38:29.875
Ah, a little Lenox first thing

38:29.875 --> 38:32.625
I got a guy --
patient concierge --

38:32.625 --> 38:35.959
fixes me up with a room
and an I.V.

38:35.959 --> 38:39.083
Forty-five minutes, and I
rebound like an undergrad.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.792
Yeah, we did that
in nursing school.

38:41.792 --> 38:43.250

Therapy is supposed
to be confidential.

41:24.625 --> 41:26.792
It's not therapy.

quit the live game in college.

41:45.708 --> 41:47.333

41:47.333 --> 41:50.875

for the Alpha Cup

42:00.166 --> 42:03.375
in two minutes.

42:03.375 --> 42:05.208
I didn't quit.

42:05.208 --> 42:08.000
They kicked me out,
and it hurt.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.209
I couldn't compete,
so they eliminated me,

42:10.209 --> 42:14.583
and it filled me with disdain,
almost hate.

42:14.583 --> 42:17.125
Hate is nature's most perfect
energy source.

42:17.125 --> 42:20.750
It's endlessly renewable.

42:20.750 --> 42:23.458
I don't want to lean
into that feeling.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.667
You know the rider
in the bicycle movie who,

42:25.667 --> 42:27.333
just when he has victory
in sight,

42:27.333 --> 42:28.875
takes his hands off the bars

42:28.875 --> 42:30.750
and just holds them out
like this,

42:30.750 --> 42:32.875
taking in the sun,
gliding,

42:32.875 --> 42:35.667
letting all the other racers
whiz by him just because?

42:35.667 --> 42:38.333
No, I don't.
What fucking movie is that?

42:38.333 --> 42:41.084
I always want
to be that biker.

42:41.084 --> 42:43.333
Yeah, but you're not.

42:43.333 --> 42:45.583
You and I
don't get to glide.

42:45.583 --> 42:48.625
We churn, and we don't get to
become friends with people

42:48.625 --> 42:49.875
we play cards with,

42:49.875 --> 42:51.458
but that's the sacrifice
we make

42:51.458 --> 42:54.500
for being able
to see what we see.

42:54.500 --> 42:57.167
I know you believe that,

42:57.167 --> 42:59.209
but I choose to take
a different lesson.

42:59.209 --> 43:01.125
It's not a choice.

43:01.125 --> 43:03.834
Now go back down
to that table.

43:03.834 --> 43:05.500
And if,
when you see Krakow,

43:05.500 --> 43:08.125
you think that maybe he will
become a friend,

43:08.125 --> 43:09.917
then go ahead.

43:09.917 --> 43:14.583
Take your hands off the bars
and let him ride on by.

43:26.708 --> 43:29.125
Do you want
to know a secret?

43:29.125 --> 43:31.834
Your boss bet me
a million dollars

43:31.834 --> 43:34.458
that you would outlast me.

43:34.458 --> 43:38.083
So, you fuck up,

43:38.083 --> 43:40.375
it's a million dollar mistake.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.042
Good to know.

43:45.042 --> 43:46.667
How do you think
he's gonna feel

43:46.667 --> 43:48.458
remembering that you
cost him a mill

43:48.458 --> 43:50.084
every time he looks at you?

43:50.084 --> 43:51.667
I mean, no pressure.

43:51.667 --> 43:53.667
Don't let me
get under your skin.

43:53.667 --> 43:57.042
You have no clue
what is under my skin,

43:57.042 --> 43:59.667
and I am certain that a million
dollars in either direction,

43:59.667 --> 44:02.875
to Mr. Axlerod or you, is
entirely insignificant.

44:02.875 --> 44:07.250
And in the continuum,
10,000 years of human history,

44:07.250 --> 44:09.875
this card game
and the Alpha Cup --

44:09.875 --> 44:11.041
what does it mean?

44:11.041 --> 44:13.875

we'll all be gone,

the singularity,

That's not your issue.

some of the tension...

50:35.375 --> 50:36.834
Yeah?
Will you help me?

50:36.834 --> 50:38.750
...I'm sure has been
building up, yeah.

50:38.750 --> 50:42.167
I want to show you this getup
I have back here.

51:01.208 --> 51:04.042
Does that  help?

51:04.042 --> 51:05.959
Usable quality.

51:05.959 --> 51:07.708
Uh, we, uh --
we can work with this.

51:07.708 --> 51:11.041
Michaela, you did great,
above and beyond.

51:11.041 --> 51:14.125
So, I believe
I'm off the hook?

51:18.042 --> 51:20.208
You are.
Come on.

51:26.542 --> 51:29.125
It's over, then?

51:29.125 --> 51:31.583
Your part's done,
but the case isn't.

51:31.583 --> 51:33.458
You're not calling me.
I get it.

51:35.667 --> 51:40.083
I can't have anything brought up
in court that might look...

51:40.083 --> 51:44.917
You know, I checked,
and my trade wasn't illegal,

51:44.917 --> 51:47.667
but I went ahead and did it
for you, anyway.

51:47.667 --> 51:50.250
Good luck with your case.

51:54.084 --> 51:55.542
Yeah. Hold on.
Hey, Lara?

51:55.542 --> 51:57.000
Hey, what?

51:57.000 --> 51:59.708
I'm on with a guy from
Wimmershoff Capital Management.

51:59.708 --> 52:02.333
They were there last night,
and they're all banged up.

52:02.333 --> 52:04.042
You make house calls,
right?

52:05.083 --> 52:07.583
Starting at $500 a drip?

52:07.583 --> 52:09.458
Starting at $1,000.

52:09.458 --> 52:11.125
We're in business, Mo.

52:29.875 --> 52:31.042
This is yours.

52:31.042 --> 52:32.250
You won it.

52:32.250 --> 52:34.209
I don't have room for it
on my desk.

52:34.209 --> 52:36.834
Besides, people keep coming by
to drink beer out of it.

52:39.583 --> 52:41.166
Hmm.

52:41.166 --> 52:43.166
Okay.

52:43.166 --> 52:46.750
But your name
is on it forever.

52:46.750 --> 52:49.167
I know you don't want me
to have attachments,

52:49.167 --> 52:51.291
things that get in the way
of winning...

52:51.291 --> 52:52.375
but you  do.

52:52.375 --> 52:53.959
That woman on the rail --

52:53.959 --> 52:56.084
Krakow's coach --
you kept looking at her.

52:56.084 --> 52:58.583
I thought you were trying
to see if she was cheating,

52:58.583 --> 53:00.000
signaling him somehow.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.084
She wasn't.
I know.

53:02.084 --> 53:03.750
Later I realized
the whole thing

53:03.750 --> 53:05.917
wasn't about you
beating Krakow.

53:05.917 --> 53:07.375
It was about breaking him

53:07.375 --> 53:09.792
and having her watch him
go on tilt.

53:09.792 --> 53:14.083
Breaking him was the only way
to beat him.

53:14.083 --> 53:16.084
Was it?

53:22.875 --> 53:26.583
Mr. McKinnon, I'm sorry
to put you through this.

53:38.208 --> 53:40.417
It's Shayleen.

53:52.750 --> 53:54.167
Turn it off.

53:55.208 --> 53:56.417
Turn it off!

54:01.583 --> 54:02.875
The moaning.

54:02.875 --> 54:05.375
Yeah. I know.

54:05.375 --> 54:06.917
I know.

54:06.917 --> 54:08.708
Would you like a drink,
Mr. McKinnon?

54:08.708 --> 54:10.500
No.

54:10.500 --> 54:12.291
You're strong.

54:12.291 --> 54:14.208
I'd need one.

54:16.208 --> 54:18.959
I want to make
this divorce hurt.

54:18.959 --> 54:21.042
I'll take the kids
and the fucking house.

54:21.042 --> 54:23.959
Hold on to that, Tom.

54:23.959 --> 54:26.708
Be hurt, sure.

54:26.708 --> 54:28.166
Be angry at Shayleen.

54:28.166 --> 54:32.000
She was weak.
But be angrier at Boyd.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.417
He's the responsible
party here.

54:34.417 --> 54:36.708
Yeah. We were friends.

54:38.959 --> 54:41.250
Spent long weekends
at his compound.

54:41.250 --> 54:45.083
Lawrence Boyd can be friend
to no man.

54:50.125 --> 54:54.291
He's a venal beast
of the first order.

54:54.291 --> 54:57.417
He needs to demonstrate that
he is the alpha of the pack,

54:57.417 --> 55:00.083
needs to dominate you
in his own mind

55:00.083 --> 55:03.000
by heaving his seed
into your bride.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.458
Jesus fuck.

55:05.458 --> 55:08.125
He didn't use a rubber?

55:08.125 --> 55:09.834
Of course
you want to kill him.

55:09.834 --> 55:11.375
I know I would.

55:11.375 --> 55:13.417
Choke him till the light
goes out.

55:13.417 --> 55:16.542
Violation like that stirs a man
to savagery.

55:16.542 --> 55:18.458
You won't do it,
but you want  to.

55:18.458 --> 55:19.834
Isn't that right?

55:19.834 --> 55:21.542
Yeah, I want to
fucking kill him.

55:21.542 --> 55:25.167
Yeah, but you can't.
The law dictates that you can't.

55:25.167 --> 55:28.041
And yet that doesn't mean
you have to let him win.

55:30.458 --> 55:32.375
Okay, so,
how do I win here?

55:32.375 --> 55:34.166
Disgrace him.

55:34.166 --> 55:36.542
Humble him.

55:36.542 --> 55:38.125
Force him to his knees

55:38.125 --> 55:41.875
and fuck his metaphorical throat
until he swallows your  seed.

55:43.500 --> 55:45.000
I'm in.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.084
Boyd's been rigging
Treasury bids.

55:47.084 --> 55:48.375
I'll get you whatever I can.

55:53.209 --> 55:55.000
Whatever it takes,
I'm in.

55:59.125 --> 56:02.000
I talked to a friend of mine,
a lawyer for the League.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.333
He back-channeled
and got a yellow light.

56:04.333 --> 56:07.792
NFL thinks it would be best
for all involved

56:07.792 --> 56:09.000
if you didn't bid.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.041
Stated reason?

56:10.041 --> 56:11.458
Public perception,

56:11.458 --> 56:13.542
recent legal aspersion,
9/11 revelations.

56:13.542 --> 56:14.667
Fuck!

56:14.667 --> 56:16.250
But they appreciate
your interest.

56:16.250 --> 56:17.250
Oh, do they?

56:24.458 --> 56:26.875
You know, when they like
my number enough,

56:26.875 --> 56:28.166
they'll like me just fine.

56:28.166 --> 56:29.625
You know what
we bid before.

56:29.625 --> 56:32.000
A hundred more than any team
has ever sold for.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.208
I'll bet a hundred
over that

56:33.208 --> 56:35.083
and send it
right to the league office.

56:35.083 --> 56:36.041
Done.

56:38.209 --> 56:40.250
These are the books
you asked for.

56:40.250 --> 56:42.792
Oh, great.
Thank you.

56:42.792 --> 56:44.417
These mattered
to him a lot.

56:44.417 --> 56:46.209
Mr. "H" told me
to tell you that.

56:46.209 --> 56:47.417
Good.

56:47.417 --> 56:49.042
He instructed me to pay cash.

56:49.042 --> 56:50.875
There's no record
of who bought them.

56:50.875 --> 56:52.125
Thank you.

56:55.084 --> 56:56.417
This one's signed
to Monty.

56:56.417 --> 56:57.708
General Montgomery?

56:57.708 --> 56:58.917
Yeah, that  Monty.

56:58.917 --> 57:00.834
Well, you want them here?
At the house?

57:00.834 --> 57:02.167
No. Put them in storage.

57:04.583 --> 57:07.333
You know what?

57:07.333 --> 57:09.834
Find all the other signed
first editions for sale

57:09.834 --> 57:12.583
in the U.S. and in England --
fuck it -- everywhere.

57:12.583 --> 57:16.000
And buy them all,
every single last one of them.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.708
That'll be expensive.

57:20.458 --> 57:23.333
