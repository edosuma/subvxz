IN SEVENTH GRADE,

08:56.003 --> 08:57.204
AND I JUST FLIPPED FOR IT.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.039
EVER SINCE THEN,
WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE READING,

08:59.072 --> 09:01.842
I JUST READ THAT.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.311
- THAT'S LITERALLY THE ONLY BOOK
YOU'VE READ SINCE SEVENTH GRADE?

09:04.344 --> 09:05.813
- WHEN YOU FIND
THE BOOK YOU LOVE,

09:05.846 --> 09:06.847
NO NEED TO KEEP SEARCHING.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.981
[both laughing]

09:08.015 --> 09:09.650
- RIGHT, TOTALLY.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.852
- * SOPHISTAFUNK, ARISTOCATS

09:11.885 --> 09:14.054
* DISTINGUISHED DOGS,
CLEAN UP YOUR ACTS *

09:14.087 --> 09:14.955
* PULL UP YOUR PANTS

09:14.988 --> 09:16.256
* LADIES AND GENTS

09:16.289 --> 09:18.091
* PLEASE, ACT LIKE
YOU GOT SOME SENSE *

09:18.125 --> 09:21.194
* YOU KNOW WHAT
I REALLY WANT TO KNOW? *

09:21.228 --> 09:25.599
* WHERE DO ALL
THE GOOD GIRLS GO? *

09:25.633 --> 09:26.967
* WHAT CLUBS THEY HANG IN?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.068
both: GOOD MORNING.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.369
- HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

09:29.402 --> 09:32.005
- UGH!
SUCKED.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.206
IT WAS AWFUL.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.108
GARY BLEW ME OFF...
- HMM.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.344
- AND THEN, UM,
I ATE A COUPLE OF POT BROWNIES,

09:37.377 --> 09:39.647
AND I TOTALLY FREAKED OUT.
I HAD TO CALL THE PARAMEDICS.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.781
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.616
AND THEN THIS HOT FIREMAN GUY
ASKED ME OUT ON A DATE.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.884
[phone rings]
MAN.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.985
OH, YEAH.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.820
IT'S HIM.
THE GUY.

09:46.854 --> 09:47.921
IT'S THE THIRD TIME
HE'S CALLED THIS MORNING.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.356
- SO?

09:49.389 --> 09:50.658
YOU GONNA GO OUT WITH HIM,
OR WHAT?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.025
- NAH.
- NAH?

09:52.059 --> 09:55.863
WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE HE'S LIKE EYE CANDY.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.965
HE'S ONLY READ ONE BOOK.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.167
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
ANOTHER THING TO DEAL WITH.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.935
RIGHT, IT'S LIKE
GETTING A PRESENT

10:01.969 --> 10:03.403
AND THEN HAVING TO WRITE
A THANK-YOU NOTE.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.073
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
NOT WORTH IT.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.242
- AS THE COURT
DETERMINES SENTENCING,

10:09.276 --> 10:11.278
THE STATE WOULD LIKE
TO POINT OUT

10:11.311 --> 10:14.014
THE DELIBERATE NATURE
OF THE CRIME.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.149
I'D LIKE TO CALL DR. GARY BOYD,

10:16.183 --> 10:19.019
BOARD CERTIFIED PSYCHIATRIST.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.221
- DR. BOYD.
- YOUR HONOR.

10:21.254 --> 10:24.057
- DR. BOYD,
HOW WOULD YOU EVALUATE

10:24.091 --> 10:28.295
MISS BARTON'S STATE OF MIND
TO BECOME PUBLICLY INTOXICATED?

10:28.328 --> 10:30.130
- COUNSELOR, IT'S CLEAR TO ME
THAT MISS BARTON

10:30.163 --> 10:31.799
DID THIS FOR THE ATTENTION.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.734
SHE WANTED THE CIRCUS
SHE KNEW WOULD COME

10:33.767 --> 10:35.135
WITH THE ARREST AND TRIAL.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.337
BUT DEEP DOWN,
I BELIEVE SHE IS TORTURED

10:37.370 --> 10:39.006
BECAUSE SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT KIND OF ATTENTION

10:39.039 --> 10:41.074
SHE ACTUALLY WANTS FROM PEOPLE.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.409
- OBJECTION!

10:42.442 --> 10:45.212
I WOULD SAY IF I WERE
THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.181
THIS IS PURELY SPECULATIVE.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.182
- OBJECTION?

10:49.216 --> 10:51.218
- SUSTAINED.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.888
- [gasps]
WHOOPSIES.

10:54.922 --> 10:55.889
[sighs]

10:55.923 --> 10:58.859
[cameras clicking]

10:58.892 --> 10:59.860
[gasps]

10:59.893 --> 11:01.862
#EMBARRASSED.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.997
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ORDER, ORDER IN THE COURT.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.165
AND BRIANNA,
IF YOU DO THAT AGAIN,

11:05.198 --> 11:07.000
IT'S GONNA BE #CONTEMPTOFCOURT.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.736
UNDERSTOOD?

11:08.769 --> 11:11.371
[phone ringing]

11:11.404 --> 11:13.473
ALL RIGHT,
WHOSE CELL PHONE IS IT?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.175
NO? OKAY, WELL,
I'M A WOMAN OF MY WORD.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.276
I SAID I'D ARREST
THE NEXT PERSON

11:16.309 --> 11:17.811
WHOSE CELL PHONE
WENT OFF IN HERE,

11:17.845 --> 11:20.380
SO I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ARREST ALL OF YOU.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.182
AND A WORD TO THE PAPARAZZI:

11:22.215 --> 11:23.884
THIS GIRL MIGHT BE
DOING THE TIME,

11:23.917 --> 11:26.386
BUT YOU ARE ALL COMPLICIT
IN THE CRIME.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.121
WITHOUT YOU, SHE'S JUST

11:28.155 --> 11:31.091
BELINDA...WISNIEWSKI

11:31.124 --> 11:33.160
FROM BOISE.
- [gasps]

11:33.193 --> 11:34.962
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

11:34.995 --> 11:36.797
CAT GOT YOUR HASHTAG?

11:36.830 --> 11:40.367
- YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
NEED MORE HANDCUFFS.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.736
[both laughing]

11:42.770 --> 11:45.405
SEEING THEIR FACES!

11:45.438 --> 11:47.140
- [clears throat]

11:47.174 --> 11:48.108
JUDGE HERNANDEZ.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.143
- REBECCA, I HEARD SOMETHING
VERY DISTURBING

11:50.177 --> 11:52.079
IN MY THE MIDDLE
OF MY TRIPLE MURDER TRIAL.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.314
- WELL, SIR,
THAT'S NOT TOTALLY SURPRISING.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.384
- APPARENTLY YOU ARRESTED
YOUR ENTIRE COURTROOM?

11:57.417 --> 11:59.152
THAT WAS REACTIVE
AND UNPROFESSIONAL.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.021
- OH, SIR, COME ON.
THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.089
THEY'RE PAPARAZZI.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.156
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.092
YOU PULL ANOTHER
STUNT LIKE THIS,

12:05.125 --> 12:07.795
AND YOU WILL ANSWER
TO THE JUDICIAL CONDUCT BOARD.

12:10.497 --> 12:14.034
AND GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS VAN.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.136
- HE DOES NOT HAVE
JURISDICTION OVER MY VAN.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.238
- YOU NEED TO CALL THAT FIREMAN.
- [sighs]

12:18.271 --> 12:19.973
- EVER SINCE GARY STOOD YOU UP,

12:20.007 --> 12:21.541
YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF STUFF
GOING ON UP THERE,

12:21.574 --> 12:23.010
MAYBE MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.945
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT
YOU CONNECTED WITH HIM

12:24.978 --> 12:25.946
ON SOME LEVEL, RIGHT?

12:25.979 --> 12:27.447
JUST ENJOY IT.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.249
- I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO,

12:29.282 --> 12:30.383
BUT I DON'T NEED
THE COMPLICATION

12:30.417 --> 12:31.384
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.188
I AM NOT CALLING THE FIREMAN.

12:47.968 --> 12:48.101
.

12:48.135 --> 12:48.401
- [sighs]

12:48.802 --> 12:52.005
- MORNING, BABY.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.540
- [sighs]

12:53.573 --> 12:56.810
HEY, YOU DON'T THINK I HAVE
A MUFFIN TOP, DO YOU?

12:56.844 --> 12:58.445
- THERE'S NOTHING
MUFFIN-LIKE ABOUT YOU,

12:58.478 --> 13:00.180
EXCEPT MAYBE YOU'RE SO SWEET.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.548
- AWW.
HMM.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.816
MMM.
MMM.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.217
[muttering]

13:04.251 --> 13:05.318
YOU WANT A COFFEE?
YOU WANT THAT?

13:05.352 --> 13:07.320
THAT'S NICE.
RISE AND SHINE.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.956
- SURE, YEAH.
- YEAH.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.457
- DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
DOING THIS WEEKEND,

13:10.490 --> 13:12.459
BUT I'M SORT OF
THE FIREHOUSE CHILI GUY.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.560
PICK A NIGHT, I'LL COME OVER

13:13.593 --> 13:15.095
AND MAKE A POT
OF THREE ALARM CHILI.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.831
I USED TO MAKE FIVE ALARM,
BUT IT'S TOO SPICY.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.300
DROPPED IT DOWN TO TWO ALARM,
NOBODY ATE IT.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.401
- HUH.
- NOW IT'S THREE.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.936
JUST RIGHT.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.938
- I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU GUYS
ACTUALLY ATE CHILI.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.140
I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST
A STEREOTYPE.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.309
A CLICHE.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.846
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT FIREMEN
ACTUALLY ATE THAT MUCH CHILI.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.982
- OH, YEAH.
- YEAH.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.583
- I EAT CHILI WITH EVERYTHING.
- UH-HUH.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.952
- CHILI, CHILI AND BAKED POTATO,
CHILI WITH SPAGHETTI,

13:38.986 --> 13:40.253
CHILI CON CARNE,
CHILI WITH EGGS, CHILI WITH--

13:40.287 --> 13:41.889
- BILLY.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.024
WE CAN'T DO THIS.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.859
IT'S JUST THE ORDINANCE.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.928
YEAH, YEAH, THERE'S
A STATE ORDINANCE THAT SAYS

13:47.961 --> 13:52.165
THAT FIREMEN AND JUDGES
AREN'T ALLOWED TO DATE.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.634
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY WHAT WE DID
LAST NIGHT IS ILLEGAL,

13:54.667 --> 13:57.370
AND WE COULD BOTH BE FIRED.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.972
- I HAD NO IDEA.
- I KNOW.

13:59.006 --> 13:59.907
IT'S A REAL BUMMER.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.108
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE

14:01.141 --> 14:02.976
JUDGES AND FIREMEN DATING,
RIGHT?

14:03.010 --> 14:05.979
I MEAN, BUT I AM GONNA DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

14:06.013 --> 14:07.981
AS A JUDGE TO RECTIFY
THE SITUATION.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.051
THAT MEANS TO CORRECT
OR SET RIGHT.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.886
- SO WILL I.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.954
I'M GONNA GO HOME RIGHT NOW,

14:13.987 --> 14:16.957
AND I'M--I'M GONNA WRITE
A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.392
- THAT'S THE TICKET.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.596
- GOOD MORNING, JUDGE.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.398
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT
ALL THE PAPARAZZI

14:25.432 --> 14:28.235
ARE DOWN THE HALL TRYING
TO GET THEIR CHARGES DROPPED.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.271
- THAT, MY YOUNG TEDWARD,
IS GREATNESS.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.173
- MM-HMM, OH, WELL, WELL.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.474
CARAMEL ICED COFFEE--

14:34.507 --> 14:35.909
YOUR "MORNING AFTER
I GOT SOME" DRINK?

14:35.943 --> 14:38.912
- PLEASE, I DRINK THIS
ALL THE TIME.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.113
- YEAH, THAT'S ALSO TRUE.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.281
- OH, SHUT UP.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.549
- SO, WAIT, YOU'RE TELLING ME

14:42.582 --> 14:43.984
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET SOME
LAST NIGHT?

14:44.017 --> 14:47.520
- NO.
- HMM.

14:47.554 --> 14:51.491
WELL, I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN,
BUT FIRST, LET ME SWEAR YOU IN.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.960
- FINE, STOP, ALL RIGHT.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.529
I WENT OUT WITH THE FIREMAN,
AND...

14:56.563 --> 14:57.564
HE SLEPT OVER.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.665
- GOOD FOR YOU.

14:58.698 --> 14:59.732
- NO, NOT GOOD FOR--

14:59.766 --> 15:03.070
WELL, ACTUALLY IT WAS--
IT WAS PRETTY GOOD FOR ME.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.571
- YEAH, GIVE ME A BUMP.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.673
- BUT, NO, HE'S A DOOF.
I HAD TO CUT HIM LOOSE.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.241
TEDWARD, ALL THE GUY
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT

15:08.275 --> 15:10.243
IS MAKING HIS FRICKIN' CHILI.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.412
- WHOA, WHAT?
HE'S THE FIREHOUSE CHILI GUY?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.114
- YEAH.
- YOU GOT TO TRY HIS CHILI.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.282
- I DON'T WANT HIS CHILI.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.716
- PROBABLY THE BEST CHILI
YOU EVER HAD.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.684
- I DON'T WANT HIS CHILI.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.551
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA TRY
HIS CHILI EVEN ONCE?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.587
- I DON'T WANT HIS CHILI!
- [sighs]

15:20.620 --> 15:22.255
LOOK, I DON'T GET YOU, JUDGE.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.491
YOU DON'T WANT SOMETHING
REAL WITH GARY.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.059
YOU DON'T WANT SOMETHING
LIGHT AND EASY

15:26.093 --> 15:28.128
WITH A HERO WHO MAKES CHILI
FOR OTHER HEROES.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.329
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

15:29.362 --> 15:32.365
- I DON'T WANT TO ANSWER
ALL THESE QUESTIONS.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.433
[sighs]

15:33.466 --> 15:36.536
TEDWARD.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.107
[sighs]

15:40.140 --> 15:41.341
- ENJOY YOUR MUFFIN TOP.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.611
- I DON'T HAVE A MUFFIN TOP.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.346
ACTUALLY,
I DO HAVE A MUFFIN TOP.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.386
ALL RIGHT, ANYONE HAVE
ANYTHING THEY WANT TO ADD

15:53.420 --> 15:55.388
BEFORE I PRONOUNCE SENTENCE?

15:55.422 --> 15:57.124
TOM.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.159
- YOU NEED TO SEND
A MESSAGE, YOUR HONOR.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.294
BETWEEN THE EXTRA COPS
FOR TRAFFIC AND SECURITY,

16:01.328 --> 16:04.464
PLUS ADDED STAFF
FOR THIS WHOLE MEDIA CIRCUS,

16:04.497 --> 16:06.333
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THESE CASES COST?

16:06.366 --> 16:07.334
- NO, HOW MUCH?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.169
- HMM?

16:09.202 --> 16:12.172
I-I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH,

16:12.205 --> 16:15.108
BUT--BUT I KNOW IT IS--
I KNOW IT IS A LOT.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.178
IT IS A REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY LOT.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.579
I'M DONE.
- THANK YOU, COUNSELOR.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.349
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH IT COSTS.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.618
I AM LOOKING AT A SAD,
LOST GIRL,

16:25.652 --> 16:28.121
SOMEONE WHO IS SO TERRIFIED
OF BEING ALONE

16:28.155 --> 16:28.988
THAT SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

16:29.022 --> 16:30.790
WITHOUT THE PAPARAZZI
WITNESSING IT.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.393
SO, BRIANNA,
I AM GOING TO HELP YOU

16:33.426 --> 16:35.028
FACE YOUR FEARS HEAD-ON.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.098
I SENTENCE YOU TO BE ALONE.
- WHAT?

16:38.131 --> 16:40.333
- FOUR WEEKS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE

16:40.367 --> 16:43.803
AT THE SISTER MARY PERPETUAL
SORROW CONVENT AND RETREAT

16:43.836 --> 16:48.541
DEEP IN THE SANTA YNEZ MOUNTAINS
WELL OUT OF CELL PHONE REACH.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.810
- [scoffs]
- OKAY, I SEE THE DUCK FACE.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.345
I'M GONNA SPARE YOU
THE FINE THIS TIME,

16:52.379 --> 16:54.147
BUT YOU PULL THAT CRAP
WITH SISTER CATHERINE,

16:54.181 --> 16:57.050
AND SHE WILL SLAP THE RESTYLANE
