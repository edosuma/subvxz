00:00.031 --> 00:01.607
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

00:01.617 --> 00:05.364
I'll send you on an epic quest.

00:05.375 --> 00:06.699
Q, I think this is it.

00:06.709 --> 00:08.535
"The Tale of the Seven Keys."

00:08.545 --> 00:10.871
Okay, if fixing magic is,
like, so important to you,

00:10.881 --> 00:12.706
then you should just talk
to this crazy guy

00:12.716 --> 00:14.208
that I met back in Athens one time.

00:14.218 --> 00:16.065
You mean Prometheus? He's dead.

00:16.077 --> 00:17.128
Damn it!

00:17.139 --> 00:19.212
He told me this crazy story one time

00:19.222 --> 00:21.814
about how there was, like,
a secret back door

00:21.824 --> 00:23.249
to magic.

00:23.259 --> 00:24.317
<i>I have...</i>

00:24.327 --> 00:25.617
<i>magic.</i>

00:25.627 --> 00:27.653
I have to be able
to do something with it.

00:27.663 --> 00:29.455
I planted a seed for you to grow.

00:29.465 --> 00:31.724
<i>It doesn't matter where it comes from.</i>

00:31.734 --> 00:33.625
<i>It matters what you do with it.</i>

<i>"The Tale of the Seven Keys,"</i>

00:48.583 --> 00:50.441
<i>chapter eight.</i>

00:53.453 --> 00:55.145
<i>The Knight remained imprisoned</i>

00:55.155 --> 00:57.147
<i>at the Castle at the End of the World.</i>

00:57.157 --> 00:59.350
<i>Not even a warrior as great as he</i>

00:59.360 --> 01:00.751
<i>could break the bonds placed on him</i>

01:00.761 --> 01:02.253
<i>by the Witch.</i>

01:02.263 --> 01:04.188
<i>He could not escape.</i>

01:04.197 --> 01:06.490
<i>But his daughter, now every bit</i>

01:06.500 --> 01:07.791
<i>the knight her father was,</i>

01:07.801 --> 01:09.760
<i>and more so, never gave up.</i>

01:09.770 --> 01:13.296
<i>She fought monsters, real and imagined,</i>

01:13.306 --> 01:15.631
<i>without as well as within.</i>

01:15.641 --> 01:17.767
<i>She had won all seven keys,</i>

01:17.777 --> 01:20.937
<i>and now she set sail for the
Castle at the End of the World.</i>

01:20.947 --> 01:22.438
Okay, tick-tock.

01:22.448 --> 01:23.839
Does it say where the castle is?

01:23.849 --> 01:25.608
Shh, Bambi. Let him read.

01:25.618 --> 01:27.276
Just saying, andale.

01:27.286 --> 01:31.446
Okay, so she faces the door
of the castle.

01:31.456 --> 01:34.283
<i>In the door, there were seven keyholes.</i>

01:34.293 --> 01:36.718
<i>The door swallowed the keys whole</i>

01:36.728 --> 01:38.653
<i>and slowly opened.</i>

01:38.663 --> 01:41.523
<i>Up ahead, she saw her father,
bound by seven chains.</i>

01:41.533 --> 01:43.825
<i>"Father," she cried,
"I'm here to save you."</i>

01:43.835 --> 01:46.294
<i>She placed the keys into the locks,</i>

01:46.304 --> 01:48.562
<i>- and when she turned the seventh...
- Sorry, time out.</i>

01:48.572 --> 01:51.299
I thought the weird door
swallowed the keys.

01:51.309 --> 01:52.666
Yeah, no, it did, but then...

01:52.676 --> 01:54.969
But then she has them again?

01:54.979 --> 01:56.637
I'm not that drunk.

01:56.647 --> 01:58.372
This is sloppy plotting.

01:58.382 --> 02:00.707
Or it's a paradox.

02:00.717 --> 02:02.208
- Hmm.
- That's a clue.

02:02.218 --> 02:03.709
Oh, we're... ed.

02:03.719 --> 02:05.979
The... ing Library is ready to swoop in

02:05.989 --> 02:08.214
with a... what's it called?

02:08.223 --> 02:10.683
Siphon, and it's not that simple.

02:10.693 --> 02:12.429
Takes a lot of power to charge it,

02:12.440 --> 02:14.869
and they don't have those kind
of reserves just lying around,

02:14.879 --> 02:17.324
thanks to Julia freeing those fairies.

02:17.334 --> 02:19.724
Yeah, well, it's the Library.
They'll think of something.

02:19.734 --> 02:21.526
All we gotta do is beat them to it.

02:21.536 --> 02:22.861
I mean, their window of time

02:22.871 --> 02:25.431
to even use the, uh, whatchamacallit

02:25.441 --> 02:26.967
is super short, right?

02:26.978 --> 02:28.767
Less than a minute,
once we turn the key.

02:28.777 --> 02:31.003
There you go.
Get all this done before...

02:31.013 --> 02:32.771
<i>Our Lady of the Tree, help us.</i>

02:32.781 --> 02:34.739
<i>Please, help me!</i>

02:36.884 --> 02:37.908
Hi, Julia.

02:37.918 --> 02:39.610
Pleasure to finally meet you.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.846
I'm Iris, messenger goddess,

02:41.856 --> 02:43.948
bon vivant, rainbow aficionado.

02:43.958 --> 02:45.224
Let's chat.

02:46.294 --> 02:47.618
Who's...

02:47.628 --> 02:49.454
Our Lady of the Tree?

02:49.464 --> 02:50.888
You are.

02:50.902 --> 02:52.456
I presume they mean

02:52.466 --> 02:54.358
the trees you brought back in Fillory.

02:54.368 --> 02:56.834
Lovely act of penance.
Good moniker for you.

02:57.770 --> 02:59.696
Just what are you saying?

02:59.706 --> 03:03.266
You fulfilled the task
Our Lady Underground gave you...

03:03.276 --> 03:04.934
to grow the spark...

03:04.944 --> 03:06.703
and now you are the flame.

03:06.713 --> 03:08.438
So I'm...

03:08.448 --> 03:10.739
A full-on goddess, correct.

03:12.318 --> 03:13.709
Holy shit.

03:13.719 --> 03:15.378
Shall we go? We have a lot of work

03:15.388 --> 03:16.945
to do, love, all very exciting.

03:16.955 --> 03:19.415
I'm sort of in the middle of this quest.

03:19.425 --> 03:21.525
Oh, that. They can take it from here.

03:23.062 --> 03:24.887
Your concerns are greater now.

03:24.897 --> 03:27.322
Your duty to them is over.

03:28.799 --> 03:31.559
And by the way, so is all that pain.

03:31.569 --> 03:32.827
You can put it down.

03:34.472 --> 03:35.563
Okay.

03:35.573 --> 03:36.764
I mean, should I, like, bow?

03:36.774 --> 03:38.733
No. I mean, I'm still me.

03:38.743 --> 03:40.402
Well, you're clearly not.

03:40.412 --> 03:42.070
I mean, it's been kind of hard

03:42.080 --> 03:43.737
to ignore the nuclear power plant

03:43.747 --> 03:45.439
radiating off you the last couple weeks.

03:47.017 --> 03:48.742
I don't know, just...

03:48.752 --> 03:50.777
wanted us to finish this
together, you know?

03:50.787 --> 03:53.580
Mm, me too, but...

03:53.590 --> 03:55.349
I mean, let's be honest, like,

03:55.359 --> 03:56.850
you deserve this.

03:56.860 --> 03:59.086
Why me?

03:59.096 --> 04:00.920
Life is unfair,

04:00.930 --> 04:02.988
but I'm good with it
occasionally working out

04:02.998 --> 04:05.466
for people that I actually love.

04:06.635 --> 04:07.960
Our Lady of the Tree.

04:12.641 --> 04:14.100
No, it's good.

04:14.110 --> 04:15.601
Yeah, it's good.

04:15.611 --> 04:16.769
It's formal.

04:16.779 --> 04:17.802
Very formal.

04:21.983 --> 04:23.442
I'm gonna miss you too.

04:38.566 --> 04:39.957
What was that?

04:39.967 --> 04:42.126
It's enough juice for a one-off spell.

04:42.136 --> 04:43.660
You know, just in case, like,

04:43.670 --> 04:47.131
a giant "Indiana Jones" boulder
comes hurtling at you.

04:47.141 --> 04:48.665
You can fight it off.

04:52.979 --> 04:55.004
I love you, Jules.

04:55.014 --> 04:56.872
I love you too.

05:05.091 --> 05:07.717
Goodbye, Quentin.

05:20.393 --> 05:24.585
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:30.515 --> 05:32.507
- Any headway?

05:32.517 --> 05:35.176
Well, wasted a few hours

05:35.186 --> 05:38.012
looking at castles, but...

05:38.022 --> 05:39.614
think I'm onto something,

05:39.624 --> 05:41.115
or someone,

05:41.125 --> 05:44.451
who could help us.

05:44.461 --> 05:46.753
I've been tripping on this, hard.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.023
It's the witch, in the castle,
sitting at a table,

05:50.033 --> 05:52.626
on which another, smaller, castle...

05:52.636 --> 05:54.628
- Yeah?
- Well, either this is some.

05:54.638 --> 05:57.430
M.C. Escher, "the castle
goes on forever" shit,

05:57.440 --> 05:59.765
or that picture means something.

05:59.775 --> 06:01.733
Do you see these?

06:01.743 --> 06:03.068
These are drafting tools

06:03.078 --> 06:06.539
for architects.

06:06.549 --> 06:08.740
Right, she's the architect that...

06:08.750 --> 06:11.610
that Reynard talked about,
that she's... oh, my God,

06:11.620 --> 06:13.579
she's the one that, uh...
she made the prison

06:13.589 --> 06:14.880
for the mistakes of the gods,

06:14.890 --> 06:17.748
and she... she hid it.

06:17.758 --> 06:20.117
She knows where it is.

06:20.127 --> 06:22.528
We need to find her, Q.

06:24.131 --> 06:26.957
There are, like, 50 minor gods
of architecture and the arts.

06:26.967 --> 06:29.460
Well, come at me. Let's
get 'em all down here.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.962
I mean, full-on goddess, huh?

06:31.972 --> 06:33.664
Look, I mean, I get that

06:33.674 --> 06:35.065
Julia has been through some shit,

06:35.075 --> 06:38.468
but seriously, it just seems random.

06:38.478 --> 06:40.571
So it's like life, then?

06:40.581 --> 06:42.673
I don't know. I'm happy for her.

06:42.683 --> 06:44.641
Me too. Might as well be.

06:44.651 --> 06:47.819
Well, I'd be happier if she
stayed, so she could help us.

06:47.830 --> 06:50.745
Look, she seemed pretty positive that
we could do this without her, so...

06:50.756 --> 06:52.582
You forgot Calypso.

06:52.592 --> 06:53.916
Like the musical style?

06:53.926 --> 06:56.118
The witch that imprisoned Odysseus.

06:56.128 --> 06:59.755
And I love you, El, but how
the hell did you pass AP Lit

06:59.765 --> 07:01.924
- without ever reading?
- I didn't.

07:01.934 --> 07:03.659
So, according to the story,

07:03.669 --> 07:05.661
she was a nymph, which...

07:05.671 --> 07:08.263
not a god, but I assume
a pretty powerful creature,

07:08.273 --> 07:10.632
considering she had him in lockdown

07:10.642 --> 07:12.267
for, like, seven full years

07:12.277 --> 07:14.001
on an island called Ogai...

07:14.011 --> 07:15.270
Ogiji?

07:15.280 --> 07:17.272
- Ogijia?
- Ogygia.

07:17.282 --> 07:18.540
However that's pronounced.

07:18.550 --> 07:19.708
Cool. Great.

07:19.718 --> 07:21.109
So do we book tickets?

07:21.119 --> 07:22.510
No, it's not...

07:22.520 --> 07:23.612
it's not a real place.

07:23.622 --> 07:25.011
Hold on, okay, so...

07:25.021 --> 07:26.647
Ogai... ogaiga,

07:26.657 --> 07:27.814
or however you say it,

07:27.824 --> 07:29.182
is a island

07:29.192 --> 07:31.218
um, in the fictional tale
of "The Odyssey."

07:31.228 --> 07:33.820
It's a clothing label,

07:33.830 --> 07:36.690
a Eurovision band,

07:36.700 --> 07:38.158
a tech company... they make games.

07:38.168 --> 07:39.693
Oh, my God.

07:39.703 --> 07:41.728
I know them. I worship them.

07:41.738 --> 07:43.829
They're the Candy Collider people.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.832
I nearly spent $600 on level 593.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.234
It took me 12 straight days.

07:48.244 --> 07:50.169
There are prisons, and
there are prisons.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.671
Right?

07:51.681 --> 07:54.574
We're all just 24/7, "Like my post."

07:54.584 --> 07:56.342
Beep-boop! Selfie!

07:56.352 --> 07:57.843
Right?

07:57.853 --> 07:59.778
No one's... No one...

07:59.788 --> 08:00.912
Okay, so the CEO

08:00.922 --> 08:03.948
is a woman named Callie.

08:03.958 --> 08:05.858
Great. Vámonos.

08:10.899 --> 08:13.191
Okay, look, I'll talk to you

08:13.201 --> 08:15.359
because I promised Prometheus I would,

08:15.369 --> 08:17.295
and I would never break my word to him,

08:17.305 --> 08:20.364
but for the record, I'm not a fan.

08:20.374 --> 08:24.201
Of you, this big magic quest,
the whole... ing thing.

08:24.211 --> 08:26.604
It's the reason Prometheus is dead.

08:26.614 --> 08:28.105
So as far as I'm concerned,

08:28.115 --> 08:30.207
you're a big part of why he's dead.

08:30.217 --> 08:31.875
No, I... we don't...

08:31.885 --> 08:33.710
Yeah, of course you don't.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.744
You're humans.

08:34.754 --> 08:36.813
Little human Magicians.

08:36.823 --> 08:38.556
He loved you so.

08:40.293 --> 08:42.327
All right, here it is.

08:44.297 --> 08:47.957
The Castle was the greatest
commission of my career.

08:47.967 --> 08:50.759
To design a prison that secure

08:50.769 --> 08:53.094
<i>for clients of that caliber...</i>

08:58.009 --> 09:02.070
<i>When I explained that I would
need the most steadfast jailors,</i>

09:02.080 --> 09:05.841
<i>Prometheus offered to help find them,</i>

09:05.851 --> 09:08.843
<i>create them with a quest.</i>

09:08.853 --> 09:11.078
<i>Always was good at quests.</i>

09:12.690 --> 09:14.649
So you trapped some poor girl

09:14.659 --> 09:16.751
into being your slave
for the rest of her life.

09:16.761 --> 09:18.853
She's there of her own will,

09:18.863 --> 09:20.187
as was her father,

09:20.197 --> 09:23.357
who offered himself
as, well, bait, really.

09:23.367 --> 09:27.260
A sort of damsel in distress
for his daughter to save.

09:27.270 --> 09:29.295
I gave them each an opportunity

09:29.305 --> 09:32.799
to perform a sacred task
to keep the world safe.

09:32.809 --> 09:33.967
I assure you,

09:33.977 --> 09:35.435
she can leave if she wishes.

09:35.445 --> 09:38.004
I wouldn't have it any other way.

09:38.014 --> 09:40.139
Surely the quest has taught you,

09:40.149 --> 09:42.616
sacrifice is part of everything.

09:44.687 --> 09:46.445
Um, so when, uh, Prometheus

09:46.455 --> 09:48.881
was looking to hide his back door...

09:48.891 --> 09:51.425
I had already designed
the perfect place.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.419
A place full of monsters

09:54.429 --> 09:56.655
where no one wants to look.

09:56.665 --> 09:59.623
He promised he would
make his quest difficult,

09:59.633 --> 10:02.293
so no quester could get
anywhere near my prison

10:02.303 --> 10:04.495
who couldn't ensure it remained secure.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.266
<i>He channeled every atom of power</i>

10:09.276 --> 10:11.002
<i>into the keys.</i>

10:11.012 --> 10:13.537
<i>So he, like, Horcruxed himself?</i>

10:13.547 --> 10:14.771
<i>Jesus.</i>

10:14.781 --> 10:17.440
<i>Someone got bit hard by the martyr bug.</i>

10:17.450 --> 10:19.676
<i>All I can say is he believed in you.</i>

10:19.686 --> 10:21.778
<i>He said he saw a time to come</i>

10:21.788 --> 10:23.780
<i>when you would save us</i>

10:23.790 --> 10:25.115
<i>if you had magic.</i>

10:25.125 --> 10:26.482
<i>He believed this completely.</i>

10:26.492 --> 10:27.684
<i>What... what does that mean?</i>

10:27.694 --> 10:30.286
Guess we'll find out,

10:30.296 --> 10:32.287
if you get to the end.

10:32.297 --> 10:34.790
He gave everything for you,

10:34.800 --> 10:37.492
<i>and then his enemies came,</i>

10:37.502 --> 10:39.494
<i>knowing he was weak.</i>

10:39.504 --> 10:41.463
<i>With his power gone,</i>

10:41.473 --> 10:43.465
<i>he couldn't stop them,</i>

10:43.475 --> 10:45.134
<i>and they were strong.</i>

11:08.498 --> 11:09.522
Sorry.

11:09.532 --> 11:11.032
It was a long time ago.

11:12.602 --> 11:14.661
So you don't suppose

11:14.671 --> 11:16.529
you want to tell us
where your prison's at,

11:16.539 --> 11:20.500
and/or how to get in?

11:20.510 --> 11:23.602
I've waiting to tell you
since the day he made the keys.

11:29.685 --> 11:31.343
Wait, this looks like...

11:31.353 --> 11:33.279
is that Fillory?

11:33.289 --> 11:35.114
It's upside-down.

11:35.124 --> 11:37.416
Looked like that before
Ember and Umber got there,

11:37.426 --> 11:40.085
when it was just a distant,
wild little world.

11:40.095 --> 11:42.353
Oh, my God.

11:42.363 --> 11:44.189
There's a...

11:44.199 --> 11:46.291
a theory about Castle Whitespire,

11:46.301 --> 11:47.558
that the dwarves based it on

11:47.568 --> 11:48.626
the most perfect design

11:48.636 --> 11:49.694
that they'd ever seen,

11:49.704 --> 11:51.462
a castle called...

11:51.472 --> 11:53.464
Blackspire, but Ember destroyed it.

11:53.474 --> 11:55.400
More like flipped the whole thing over

11:55.410 --> 11:57.201
and started over on the other side.

11:57.211 --> 11:59.636
So my castle is based on your prison?

11:59.646 --> 12:00.871
What can I say?

12:00.881 --> 12:04.308
I'm constitutionally incapable
of designing an ugly building.

12:04.318 --> 12:06.310
So Blackspire's still there,

12:06.320 --> 12:08.145
it's just... underneath.

12:08.155 --> 12:10.480
Yes.

12:10.490 --> 12:11.575
Good luck with your quest.

12:11.586 --> 12:13.208
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, lady, come on.

12:13.219 --> 12:16.619
- How do we get in? The key paradox.
- Let me get one thing clear:

12:16.629 --> 12:18.554
everything I put the girl through,

12:18.564 --> 12:22.225
I did to prepare her
for what's locked inside.

12:22.235 --> 12:23.659
You'll find your way in,

12:23.669 --> 12:27.263
and you'll find a way to do it safely
and securely, but whatever you do,

12:27.273 --> 12:29.165
there's one simple thing

12:29.175 --> 12:31.708
you need to understand
above everything else.

12:33.411 --> 12:35.570
What's locked inside that castle...

12:37.249 --> 12:41.176
Can never, ever be allowed to escape.

12:45.596 --> 12:46.703
Begging pardon,

12:46.713 --> 12:49.205
we need your official permission.

12:49.604 --> 12:52.697
As acting High King.

12:54.275 --> 12:57.268
You have my permission
to implement the new schedule.

12:57.278 --> 13:00.637
Excellent, Your acting Majesty.

13:00.647 --> 13:01.805
And if it's no trouble,

13:01.815 --> 13:03.273
bring the tax collector's

13:03.283 --> 13:04.608
latest expense reports.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.311
I would like to double-check them.

13:07.321 --> 13:08.945
Sorry.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.415
Of course. Right away.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.891
You need to stop apologizing.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.326
You'd do well to remember,

13:23.336 --> 13:26.295
that power comes from High King Margo,

13:26.305 --> 13:28.498
but it flows through you.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.299
Is there something you need?

13:30.309 --> 13:31.600
Yes.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.469
Six fairies have disappeared
in two days.

13:34.479 --> 13:36.471
And how are you certain this is...

13:36.481 --> 13:37.906
I found this.

13:37.916 --> 13:40.808
I believe it's a part
of a magical device

13:40.818 --> 13:44.854
imparting night vision
to paltry human eyes.

13:46.291 --> 13:47.782
There is no magic.

13:47.792 --> 13:50.192
Someone's hunting my people.

14:04.875 --> 14:06.667
What is this?

14:06.677 --> 14:08.334
My lab,

14:08.344 --> 14:09.969
where I come to think,

14:09.979 --> 14:12.539
answer texts, create worlds.

14:12.549 --> 14:14.674
Wait, do I get to create worlds?

14:14.684 --> 14:16.509
I mean, we'll start with one.

14:16.519 --> 14:18.344
You'll split your time between the lab

14:18.354 --> 14:20.513
and answering the prayers
of your choice.

14:20.523 --> 14:21.681
But I'll be blunt.

14:21.691 --> 14:22.949
The work we do here

14:22.959 --> 14:24.550
is much more vital to the big picture,

14:24.560 --> 14:26.718
but we find that morale stays higher

14:26.728 --> 14:28.853
if we heal a kid or two
a few times a week.

14:31.866 --> 14:33.692
One more thing.

14:33.702 --> 14:35.694
My friends...

14:35.704 --> 14:37.529
How come I can still feel them?

14:38.974 --> 14:42.366
Takes a bit for those
connections to dissolve.

14:42.376 --> 14:45.035
Q is stressing, and Fen...

14:45.045 --> 14:47.538
I know that she wants to help
save these fairies' lives but...

14:47.548 --> 14:49.474
This is the discipline.

14:49.484 --> 14:51.509
You need to keep from being seduced.

14:51.519 --> 14:54.412
You're wasted if you expend
too much energy

14:54.422 --> 14:56.547
trying to look after every last fairy

14:56.557 --> 14:57.748
when you could be building

14:57.758 --> 14:59.516
and shaping worlds

14:59.526 --> 15:01.918
where no fairy ever comes to harm.

15:01.928 --> 15:03.320
Why don't I show you?

15:10.770 --> 15:12.496
<i>So do we think the knight chick</i>

15:12.506 --> 15:13.896
is somehow still in there?

15:13.906 --> 15:16.398
It's god magic,

15:16.408 --> 15:18.501
so anything's possible.

15:18.511 --> 15:20.503
We really don't know
what could be in there.

15:20.513 --> 15:21.604
I'll Travel in.

15:21.614 --> 15:23.905
Excuse us for caring, but no.

15:23.915 --> 15:26.509
We don't know what
you'd be blipping into,

15:26.519 --> 15:28.544
and we still have enough
Penny blood on our hands

15:28.554 --> 15:29.745
from the last Penny.

15:29.755 --> 15:31.514
Okay.

15:31.524 --> 15:34.682
Say we do find some window.

15:34.692 --> 15:37.084
We know this knight is gonna help us?

15:51.808 --> 15:52.899
Hi.

15:52.909 --> 15:53.967
You're asleep.

15:53.977 --> 15:55.902
I'm in your head, not his.

15:57.648 --> 15:59.606
It's a dream.

16:05.622 --> 16:07.754
You have magic.

16:08.957 --> 16:10.082
Had.

16:10.092 --> 16:12.451
Uh, it's sort of a one-off.

16:12.461 --> 16:15.120
- Listen...
- Ora.

16:15.130 --> 16:16.622
I'm Quentin.

16:18.634 --> 16:19.925
I need your help.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.220
You're here about the fountain?
The back door to magic?

16:22.231 --> 16:23.728
Yeah.

16:23.738 --> 16:24.829
I can't help.

16:24.839 --> 16:25.963
Uh, because you're

16:25.973 --> 16:27.131
- guarding all the...
- No.

16:27.141 --> 16:28.433
They're all gone.

16:30.645 --> 16:31.969
He's the only one left.

16:31.979 --> 16:34.472
Did they all die, or?

16:34.482 --> 16:35.940
He killed them all.

16:35.950 --> 16:38.610
You can't imagine what he's capable of.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.144
That's why I can't do anything for you.

16:40.154 --> 16:42.446
I cannot risk the security of my charge.

16:42.456 --> 16:44.114
I get that.

16:44.124 --> 16:46.983
I have something to offer you too.

16:49.129 --> 16:52.423
Julia gave you a hit
of magic, and you did what?

16:52.433 --> 16:53.957
Incepted the knight in the castle.

16:53.967 --> 16:55.992
That magic was for killing a monster.

16:56.002 --> 16:57.827
Why waste it on chatting with the help?

16:57.837 --> 16:59.161
When Calypso told us that Ora

16:59.171 --> 17:00.996
was there on her own accord,

17:01.006 --> 17:03.799
I... I figured she must know
more than one way

17:03.809 --> 17:05.501
in and out of the castle, and she does,

17:05.511 --> 17:06.868
and she's going to open it for us.

17:06.878 --> 17:08.002
In exchange for...

17:08.012 --> 17:10.039
All you have to do is get in,

17:10.049 --> 17:11.107
turn the key,

17:11.117 --> 17:12.442
and get out fast.

17:12.452 --> 17:14.843
Um, what about the monster?

17:14.853 --> 17:18.714
- Ora will take care of the monster.
- What about you?

17:18.723 --> 17:21.116
I stay in the castle.

17:23.194 --> 17:24.786
It's a fair deal.

17:24.796 --> 17:26.020
She's been there for centuries,

17:26.030 --> 17:27.122
and she's tired,

17:27.132 --> 17:29.958
and I'm... I'm strong enough,

17:29.968 --> 17:31.459
thanks to the quest,

17:31.469 --> 17:32.826
so I'm the new jailor.

17:32.836 --> 17:35.195
- This isn't the solution.
- I second that.

17:35.205 --> 17:37.164
Alice, who's the one that died for us?

17:39.009 --> 17:40.701
You were willing to stay in Fillory

17:40.711 --> 17:42.536
for forever. How is this different?

17:44.081 --> 17:45.506
Someone has to step up.

17:45.516 --> 17:48.208
Quick alternative pitch: take the
gun with the god-killing bullet

17:48.218 --> 17:50.543
and shoot the... ing monster
in the face.

17:50.553 --> 17:51.844
Second second that, yes.

17:51.854 --> 17:52.912
No.

17:52.922 --> 17:54.247
I promised, no clever stuff.

17:54.257 --> 17:56.916
It's more bloody and straightforward.

17:56.926 --> 17:59.919
Look, this monster,

17:59.929 --> 18:01.187
it's not a joke.

18:01.197 --> 18:04.591
We cannot let it escape, and the only
way to make sure that it doesn't

18:04.601 --> 18:07.259
is to do this the hard way.

18:07.269 --> 18:10.095
The quest taught us
that it's like that sometimes.

18:16.077 --> 18:18.103
I don't like this.

18:18.113 --> 18:19.705
Me neither,

18:19.715 --> 18:21.039
but I'm going to do it.

18:29.747 --> 18:32.315
Hello, love.

18:32.718 --> 18:34.342
Oh, shit.

18:34.352 --> 18:36.044
It's a human.

18:36.054 --> 18:38.813
It's also the current ruler of Fillory.

18:38.823 --> 18:39.881
Hello.

18:39.891 --> 18:41.348
We've met,

18:41.358 --> 18:42.650
so we can get right to the part

18:42.660 --> 18:44.351
where I tell you to stop

18:44.361 --> 18:45.920
stealing fairies to chop up.

18:45.930 --> 18:48.022
They are full citizens of Fillory.

18:48.032 --> 18:49.657
You will cease at once.

18:49.667 --> 18:52.994
Full citizens. Well, la Di da.

18:55.772 --> 18:57.831
- Escort them to the...
- Ah, ah, ah.

18:57.841 --> 18:59.432
Know what a traveler is?

18:59.442 --> 19:03.504
We can blip on out of here and go
about our beeswax anytime we please.

19:04.614 --> 19:07.574
I have something you very much need

19:07.584 --> 19:09.617
in the castle.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.584
They won't be but a moment.

19:18.594 --> 19:20.019
And may I say, sir,

19:20.029 --> 19:22.922
how much I admire your suit.

19:22.932 --> 19:24.723
I've been passing bunnies with Margo.

19:24.733 --> 19:27.026
They are very close
to turning magic back on.

19:27.036 --> 19:28.727
Hooray for them.

19:28.737 --> 19:30.394
And you must know

19:30.404 --> 19:31.896
the reason Irene is poaching fairies

19:31.906 --> 19:33.631
is she needs a huge amount of energy

19:33.641 --> 19:36.868
to power a... a thing
that must be placed

19:36.878 --> 19:39.103
just as it's connected,
within seconds, in order to...

19:39.113 --> 19:40.638
Let me save your breath.

19:40.648 --> 19:42.707
I don't care.

19:42.717 --> 19:44.475
You should.

19:44.485 --> 19:47.778
If we keep her long enough, we can
stop her from derailing magic

19:47.788 --> 19:49.446
and taking it for herself

19:49.456 --> 19:50.814
and for the Library.

19:50.824 --> 19:52.382
This is the future we're talking about.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.750
Not our future.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.760
I cannot risk another soul.

19:58.999 --> 20:01.992
I know exactly how to deal with this.

20:02.002 --> 20:04.627
<i>So, what are you offering, exactly?</i>

20:04.637 --> 20:06.462
I broke a deal.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.931
It's my fault we're vulnerable.

20:10.442 --> 20:13.469
I offer you the magic of 50 fairies

20:13.479 --> 20:14.971
with a single body.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.576
You know the power of royal marrow.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.611
You're volunteering to die?

20:22.621 --> 20:25.146
In exchange for a new agreement.

20:25.156 --> 20:27.816
- Wait.
- No fairy will be hunted

20:27.826 --> 20:31.152
by a non-fairy anywhere, ever,

20:31.162 --> 20:33.822
and this deal cannot be broken,

20:33.832 --> 20:34.956
for any reason,

20:34.966 --> 20:38.826
by any being, ever.

20:38.836 --> 20:40.494
Swear to that,

20:40.504 --> 20:41.937
and you have me.

20:43.173 --> 20:45.766
Time is of the essence.

20:45.776 --> 20:48.836
My offer expires in one minute.

20:51.148 --> 20:52.506
<i>I'm gonna need a table</i>

20:52.516 --> 20:53.641
with restraints,

20:53.651 --> 20:57.023
uh, a bone saw, knives, and a grinder.

21:02.125 --> 21:03.983
There must be another way.

21:03.993 --> 21:05.985
The deal I struck with Irene

21:05.995 --> 21:07.787
will finally make it possible

21:07.797 --> 21:10.456
for my people to be safe and free.

21:13.501 --> 21:16.528
Tears for your enemy?

21:33.654 --> 21:35.079
<i>Any day now.</i>

21:35.089 --> 21:36.580
<i>My God.</i>

21:36.590 --> 21:39.216
Where did it turn out to be? Alice?

21:39.226 --> 21:41.218
This Castle at the End of the World?

21:41.228 --> 21:43.721
Fillory. Underneath.

21:43.731 --> 21:46.022
Castle Blackspire.

21:46.032 --> 21:48.591
- How did you...
- I was a fan, too, once.

21:51.237 --> 21:54.497
I need a favor.

21:54.507 --> 21:56.666
I have this,

21:56.676 --> 21:57.701
and I know it's wrong,

21:57.711 --> 21:58.868
and I'll never use it again,

21:58.878 --> 22:00.904
but I need it.

22:00.914 --> 22:02.172
To?

22:02.182 --> 22:04.206
I hear you have an experimental potion

22:04.216 --> 22:07.076
that not only wipes your memory,

22:07.086 --> 22:09.511
but creates a whole new persona.

22:09.521 --> 22:12.214
I do, but what?

22:12.224 --> 22:14.683
I'll always be tempted.

22:14.693 --> 22:18.053
Once I can feel it
everywhere again, and...

22:18.063 --> 22:20.588
unless I have no memory.

22:20.598 --> 22:22.957
Alice,

22:22.967 --> 22:25.793
you are...

22:25.803 --> 22:29.597
you are one of the most
brilliant Magicians

22:29.607 --> 22:30.865
I've ever seen.

22:30.875 --> 22:34.769
I didn't choose to be!

22:34.779 --> 22:37.871
I want to live my life,

22:37.881 --> 22:39.773
not how my parents raised me to think,

22:39.783 --> 22:41.108
or what you taught me,

22:41.118 --> 22:42.809
or what the Library wants me to do.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.045
I'm not sure if that's
the best path to happiness.

22:45.055 --> 22:46.880
What if there is no best path?

22:48.125 --> 22:49.950
I don't know.

22:51.294 --> 22:53.286
All I know is the one I'm on
is a bad one...

22:55.631 --> 22:57.223
And I'm stepping off.

23:19.620 --> 23:20.979
Once you've...

23:20.989 --> 23:22.180
Yes?

23:22.190 --> 23:23.648
Drink this.

23:23.658 --> 23:25.616
Give it about a full day

23:25.626 --> 23:28.085
for everything to get rebooted.

23:28.095 --> 23:30.754
After that,

23:30.764 --> 23:32.156
you are on your own.

23:41.041 --> 23:42.632
Thank you.

23:52.318 --> 23:53.943
So?

23:53.953 --> 23:55.878
We need to talk

23:55.888 --> 23:57.346
about our arrangement.

24:19.207 --> 24:20.440
You tell anyone else?

24:22.077 --> 24:23.502
Please don't.

24:23.512 --> 24:25.070
Of course not.

24:27.650 --> 24:29.675
You're the only one that I...

24:29.685 --> 24:32.343
wanted... had to tell.

24:37.024 --> 24:38.650
Look, I know that I don't show it

24:38.660 --> 24:39.784
or act like it all the time,

24:39.794 --> 24:41.619
but...

24:41.629 --> 24:44.322
but you're...

24:44.332 --> 24:47.292
you're the one that I love, Q.

24:47.302 --> 24:48.625
You're the one.

24:50.671 --> 24:53.564
And the only thing I'm going to
regret is not remembering that.

24:56.577 --> 24:58.776
Well...

24:59.406 --> 25:01.332
Well, I'll remember for the both of us.

25:36.809 --> 25:39.376
You made a deal you will regret.

25:40.629 --> 25:42.028
You'll never know.

25:43.432 --> 25:45.858
True.

25:45.868 --> 25:47.460
But I'll die a queen,

25:47.470 --> 25:50.571
not some mediocre, power-hungry girl.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.780
As I said, I'm only alive
because I fulfill its need.

27:18.790 --> 27:20.514
To be entertained.

27:20.524 --> 27:22.615
Served, coddled.

27:22.625 --> 27:24.117
Loved.

27:24.127 --> 27:26.820
Loved, like...

27:26.830 --> 27:29.222
A child.

27:29.232 --> 27:30.979
Okay, that's better
than my first thought.

27:30.990 --> 27:32.716
Right now, he thinks
we're playing a game.

27:32.727 --> 27:33.730
Hide and seek.

27:33.741 --> 27:35.915
It's the only way to ensure
he'd stay diverted long enough

27:35.926 --> 27:38.258
to let you in, and right
now, he's getting bored.

27:43.312 --> 27:44.970
What's up?

27:46.982 --> 27:49.141
In case I get held up.

27:49.151 --> 27:50.176
Don't.

27:50.186 --> 27:52.144
Hear me?

27:55.657 --> 27:57.148
You got this, okay?

28:03.098 --> 28:04.989
My love?

28:04.999 --> 28:07.225
I found you! I tag you!

28:10.238 --> 28:11.730
Give it a moment.

28:13.207 --> 28:14.832
Does it have a name?

28:14.842 --> 28:16.666
No.

28:19.346 --> 28:21.605
What makes it so dangerous?

28:21.615 --> 28:24.007
The gods created something
that simply...

28:24.017 --> 28:25.575
wants.

28:25.585 --> 28:27.044
So it has to know one secure place

28:27.054 --> 28:28.178
and constant love.

28:28.188 --> 28:29.346
If not,

28:29.356 --> 28:30.780
if its appetite goes unfed

28:30.790 --> 28:33.049
and it's unleashed,

28:33.059 --> 28:34.951
even the gods can't stop it.

28:37.596 --> 28:40.056
Love?

28:40.066 --> 28:41.290
Come out!

28:41.300 --> 28:43.059
Did you fall asleep?

28:43.069 --> 28:45.361
Yeah, but what can it do?

28:57.691 --> 28:59.158
Will you play with me?

29:22.972 --> 29:24.998
Eliot! No!

29:35.074 --> 29:36.842
- Fuck, Eliot...
- How?

29:37.248 --> 29:38.576
God-killing bullet.

29:38.717 --> 29:40.631
This is not what we agreed on.

29:40.642 --> 29:42.709
I didn't actually agree on anything,

29:42.720 --> 29:44.739
but I did decide that
one of my best friends

29:44.750 --> 29:47.342
wouldn't spend the rest of
his life locked in a prison,

29:47.353 --> 29:49.779
guarding what turns out to be a
really not-so-scary monster.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.783
Wait, where'd she go?

29:57.697 --> 30:00.421
Anyway, it's done.

30:00.431 --> 30:02.924
You spent a little bit
too much time as a king.

30:02.934 --> 30:04.793
Well, that's really not
the issue now, is it?

30:07.038 --> 30:08.864
Could've used some Goo
Gone and a toothbrush,

30:08.874 --> 30:10.659
- but I think we're good to go.
- All right, let's go.

30:10.670 --> 30:12.801
- Let's go. Come on, come on.
- All right bitches,

30:12.811 --> 30:14.238
everyone grab a key.

30:19.817 --> 30:21.274
Alice, what are you doing?

30:21.284 --> 30:22.977
Nothing good.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.445
- No!
- Margo!

30:29.493 --> 30:31.051
She's destroying the keys!

30:31.061 --> 30:32.119
I have to.

30:32.129 --> 30:34.888
You don't get to decide that the
whole universe doesn't have magic.

30:34.898 --> 30:36.188
I'll never remember this.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.232
Alice...

30:46.242 --> 30:48.067
why?

30:48.077 --> 30:50.035
You...

30:50.045 --> 30:53.171
you talked me out of
working for the Library.

30:53.181 --> 30:56.742
I realize there's no good side.

30:56.752 --> 30:59.511
Magic just makes people
different shades of bad,

30:59.521 --> 31:02.347
selfish and irresponsible.

31:02.357 --> 31:03.481
We can't handle it!

31:03.491 --> 31:05.017
You can't handle it.

31:05.027 --> 31:06.751
It's wrong.

31:06.761 --> 31:08.352
We're wrong.

31:08.362 --> 31:10.317
And it stops now!

31:21.842 --> 31:22.900
What are you doing?

31:22.910 --> 31:24.100
I'm gonna cut the bitch,

31:24.110 --> 31:27.610
grab her fairy coke
power-up, and fix this.

31:28.915 --> 31:30.974
<i>So, where shall we start?</i>

31:30.985 --> 31:32.341
Ocean?

31:32.351 --> 31:34.243
Cute little landmass?

31:34.253 --> 31:35.411
Dealer's choice.

31:37.958 --> 31:39.950
I know you can still feel them.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.117
You need to let them go.

31:42.127 --> 31:43.886
I know, but it's bad.

31:43.896 --> 31:45.888
In a blink, it'll be good again,

31:45.898 --> 31:48.057
and in two blinks, they'll be long gone.

31:49.401 --> 31:52.294
<i>He's on the floor. He's...</i>

31:52.304 --> 31:54.229
<i>He's not getting up.</i>

31:54.239 --> 31:56.565
<i>He'll die, not giving up.</i>

31:56.575 --> 31:58.399
Can't you feel his heart?

32:00.111 --> 32:01.569
<i>No,</i>

32:01.579 --> 32:03.104
<i>'cause I don't do what you're doing.</i>

32:06.250 --> 32:08.977
You need to let them go.

32:08.987 --> 32:11.145
Remember the future we're creating.

32:20.097 --> 32:21.922
Will you play with me?

32:25.602 --> 32:26.827
- Hey!
- Ah!

32:26.837 --> 32:28.061
You think you can cast

32:28.071 --> 32:29.295
faster than I can stab? Go!

32:29.305 --> 32:32.164
- Please, listen to me. The knight...
- Ah, shut the... up and...

32:35.945 --> 32:38.155
- Fix this.
- Now.

32:39.448 --> 32:42.407
There's no point.

32:42.417 --> 32:44.910
The magic's gone. It's done.

32:49.590 --> 32:51.582
He's right.

32:53.427 --> 32:54.953
Jules.

32:54.963 --> 32:59.024
None of your pain
is what we'd call quiet,

32:59.034 --> 33:00.464
especially yours.

33:02.768 --> 33:05.060
I know you thought
this was for everyone's good.

33:06.751 --> 33:08.710
You'll see someday,

33:08.721 --> 33:09.845
it wasn't.

33:11.492 --> 33:13.076
For now,

33:13.087 --> 33:14.945
I need you to stay out of the way.

33:28.212 --> 33:31.267
I want you to know, it's your bravery...

33:31.278 --> 33:33.237
made me see.

33:33.248 --> 33:34.806
See what?

33:34.817 --> 33:36.575
What I need to do.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.416
What are you doing?

33:44.426 --> 33:46.511
What Prometheus did.

33:46.521 --> 33:47.845
Whore-crotching.

33:47.855 --> 33:49.847
- Horcruxing.
- Oh.

33:49.857 --> 33:51.683
- Look, Jules, are you sure?
- Shh.

33:51.693 --> 33:53.884
Julia, you could lose your power.

34:50.246 --> 34:51.938
- Hurry.
- You okay?

34:56.853 --> 34:58.512
Okay, okay.

34:58.522 --> 34:59.946
Hey, I got you. I got you.

34:59.956 --> 35:01.915
Come on.

35:01.925 --> 35:03.284
Are you okay?

35:03.294 --> 35:05.985
It hurt.

35:05.995 --> 35:08.962
And I'm not con...
connected to anything anymore.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.659
- I got you.
- Are you guys ready?

35:15.638 --> 35:17.104
Let's do this.

36:03.182 --> 36:04.341
Dean Fogg?

36:08.321 --> 36:10.313
Travel, Penny,

36:10.323 --> 36:11.981
I kill them all.

36:51.895 --> 36:53.887
Irene...

36:53.897 --> 36:55.856
We do have a deal.

36:55.866 --> 36:58.892
Unless you want to have
a problem with the Library.

37:16.532 --> 37:18.071
<i>The very essence is altered</i>

37:18.082 --> 37:21.614
by the slightest deviation in
finger position. Watch closely.

37:24.607 --> 37:28.247
The difference is in the position
of the right middle finger.

37:31.513 --> 37:34.639
Sorry, looks like we're
having another...

37:34.649 --> 37:37.375
power issue.

37:37.385 --> 37:41.278
The rations are wholly inadequate.
I can't even assign homework!

37:41.289 --> 37:43.099
Do the best you can.

37:43.110 --> 37:46.317
I'll attempt to renegotiate
for our supply.

37:46.772 --> 37:47.838
How?

37:49.881 --> 37:52.207
I'm afraid we can't revisit
your supply until next quarter.

37:52.217 --> 37:54.176
I've spoken to the Board.

37:54.186 --> 37:56.512
- Which Board?
- North American Fourth District.

37:56.522 --> 38:00.115
Calgary enrollment hasn't
bounced back the way we have.

38:00.125 --> 38:02.050
They're barely using
2/3 of their allotment,

38:02.060 --> 38:04.286
and they've offered it to us.

38:04.296 --> 38:07.163
Both you and they need
to bring a written request to...

38:11.068 --> 38:12.168
In triplicate.

38:15.906 --> 38:17.532
You'll have a decision by the 31st.

38:17.542 --> 38:19.033
Excellent.

38:19.043 --> 38:21.469
There's just one more request.

38:21.479 --> 38:23.570
My answer hasn't changed.

38:23.580 --> 38:25.572
She made a deal with us, then broke it.

38:25.582 --> 38:27.040
Unlike the others,

38:27.050 --> 38:29.050
she belongs to the Library.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.087
I just would like to see her.

38:36.459 --> 38:38.092
Please.

38:41.430 --> 38:43.096
Where are they?

38:44.466 --> 38:46.258
Per the... deal,

38:46.268 --> 38:48.093
as struck with the Order,

38:48.103 --> 38:49.595
safe.

38:49.605 --> 38:52.331
No, no, no, no, no, they're not.

38:52.341 --> 38:55.934
Alice, the McAllistairs can't find them,

38:55.944 --> 38:57.602
and if they try,

38:57.612 --> 38:59.437
the Library's retribution will be swift.

38:59.447 --> 39:01.105
Not the McAllistairs!

39:01.115 --> 39:02.273
That thing!

39:02.283 --> 39:05.943
It can jump bodies, I told you.
You should know,

39:05.953 --> 39:08.757
that alone is a very dangerous ability.

39:08.768 --> 39:11.145
If they don't know who they
are, if they don't have magic,

39:11.156 --> 39:12.417
they can't protect themselves.

39:12.427 --> 39:14.015
Okay.

39:14.031 --> 39:15.619
Hypothetically,

39:15.629 --> 39:18.413
this thing gets loose.

39:19.199 --> 39:20.398
Why would it go after them?

39:23.002 --> 39:24.961
It's seen them.

39:24.971 --> 39:28.198
It knows magic is back.

39:28.208 --> 39:31.242
It knows they're Magicians,
even if they don't.

39:39.184 --> 39:42.945
Sophie, hit pause
on your idiocy for a sec.

39:42.955 --> 39:44.280
Janet?

39:44.290 --> 39:46.423
Hi, I'm Isaac.

39:54.499 --> 39:56.558
You're late. Me, too.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.661
Uh, luckily, I don't recognize
the legality of red lights.

41:11.205 --> 41:13.063
Quentin.

41:13.073 --> 41:14.197
I found you.

41:16.042 --> 41:17.400
no, sorry, I'm Brian.

41:19.312 --> 41:21.070
Do a card trick for me, Quentin.

41:23.717 --> 41:25.350
Come on.

41:28.388 --> 41:29.746
Will you play with me?

41:29.756 --> 41:31.647
I'm sorry, I think you've got me

41:31.657 --> 41:34.090
mistaken for somebody else,
but I... you know...

41:35.594 --> 41:36.752
<i>I saw it.</i>

41:36.762 --> 41:38.320
<i>I've felt it!</i>

41:38.330 --> 41:40.422
Even the gods are afraid of it.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.493
This is your fault,
just as much as it is mine.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.294
Get me out of here!

41:47.605 --> 41:51.165
Help me stop it.

42:08.024 --> 42:09.148
Don't be scared.

42:09.158 --> 42:10.751
This is great!

42:10.761 --> 42:13.787
There's so much for us to do together.

42:13.797 --> 42:16.490
I can't wait to get started

42:16.500 --> 42:20.527
on all the people
who really deserve our wrath.

42:20.537 --> 42:23.629
Um, no, look, please, I'm not... I...

42:23.639 --> 42:26.098
This is gonna be so fun.

42:26.108 --> 42:29.368
I think anything is more fun
when you do it with a friend.
