00:48.720 --> 00:51.679
TO MAREΚ EDELMAN

01:21.560 --> 01:22.599
Szczepek!

01:32.680 --> 01:33.719
Leave it.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.519
Shine the light.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.999
Tell them there's nothing of value here!

01:57.440 --> 01:59.679
He says his parents left nothing behind.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.399
- What are you doing with this Κraut?
- None of your business!

02:04.600 --> 02:06.599
- Hands up, Polack pig!
- Shoot!

02:07.040 --> 02:07.839
Go on!

02:08.639 --> 02:09.679
Shoot!

02:10.880 --> 02:11.799
Go ahead, shoot!

02:24.240 --> 02:26.439
Get yourself a Polish man to fuck!

04:07.360 --> 04:08.719
Where were you?

04:09.200 --> 04:10.919
A blocked pipe.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.399
Was it blocked with chickens?

04:18.079 --> 04:21.399
She needs fresh fruit or
she'll be coughing until summer.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.999
Fresh fruit?

04:25.680 --> 04:27.839
At her age I didn't even know
what an orange was.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.599
At her age you were living
on the street.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.799
Leave her alone, will you?

04:36.680 --> 04:38.199
Leave her be!

04:44.360 --> 04:46.119
- We need to get up.
- It's Sunday.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.999
- I have to go to Mass.
- There's still time.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.559
No tickling!

04:52.280 --> 04:54.519
Stop that, you fool!

04:57.280 --> 04:58.679
Something bit me.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.079
- Can you see anything?
- What?

05:03.920 --> 05:05.119
I can't see a thing.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.719
It itches terribly. Scratch me, Poldek.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.999
Quiet!

05:32.480 --> 05:34.519
You'll wake Stefcia!

05:51.600 --> 05:53.559
IN DARKNESS

06:08.040 --> 06:09.679
You're making too much noise!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.359
Get the ladder.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.759
Come on, get over here!
Go on, hurry up, move on!

06:34.200 --> 06:35.359
Dance!

06:36.400 --> 06:38.799
Put your hands up. Up!

06:46.120 --> 06:47.359
Hold him down.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.719
Say cheese...

07:21.840 --> 07:23.199
Κlara...

07:49.160 --> 07:50.679
Give him 200.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.239
See you next week.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.719
- Hello.
- Hello, Szczepek.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.199
Hey, Yid!

08:13.440 --> 08:14.799
What is it?

08:16.520 --> 08:20.239
That's for the fake engagement ring
you sold me.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.719
Marysia is expecting a nice present
for her Saints' Day.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.399
Give her a good fuck
and be done with it.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.919
I'm serious.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.519
- We have to sell this shit.
- Not now, the market's bad.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.119
This shit's worth nothing right now.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.519
You can buy decent jewelry
from a Yid for a few sausages.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.319
- Patience, Szczepek.
- Patience?

09:04.760 --> 09:09.159
Marysia's going to leave me.
Aleksy, this new neighbor of hers...

09:09.560 --> 09:12.879
She says they're just friends,
but I'm sure the bastard's fucking her.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.639
He's clever. He knows how to talk.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.999
The fucking bastard!

09:21.480 --> 09:22.599
Poldek...

09:25.360 --> 09:26.679
I love her.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.479
So beat her!
If you love a woman, beat her!

09:30.000 --> 09:31.919
- Do you beat Wanda?
- She beats me!

09:32.280 --> 09:33.919
You're teasing me again!

09:36.800 --> 09:37.759
Hear that?

09:38.480 --> 09:39.399
That...

09:45.080 --> 09:47.639
- What's that?
- From the ghetto.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.639
We're through!

10:04.040 --> 10:05.519
We've done it!

10:25.760 --> 10:27.199
The sewer is ours!

10:40.080 --> 10:42.319
So we meet again.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.839
It's Swiss. Take it.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.199
It's worth a lot. Don't you believe me?

11:04.560 --> 11:06.679
If you don't get at least 500...

11:06.760 --> 11:08.319
you can turn us in.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.759
We'd get more if we reported you.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.239
Alright.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.559
500...

11:17.560 --> 11:18.799
plus the watch.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.839
- 500 and the watch.
- No, no, no.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.919
I'll handle it. I will go up...

11:25.360 --> 11:28.559
- for the money.
- We'll come with you. Just in case.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.600
Κrysia!

11:46.640 --> 11:48.719
Stop it, or you'll both go back
into the closet!

11:56.520 --> 11:59.839
- Paulina, what are they doing here?
- They needed some fresh air.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.999
Just for a few minutes.
Don't be angry, Ignacy.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.759
I'll be right back.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.399
- What's your name?
- Pirate.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.319
Perfect name for a thief.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.719
I know the sewers better
than I know my own wife.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.759
- It's no place for you.
- There is no place for us anywhere.

12:30.520 --> 12:34.799
Βut I know places where it could work.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.479
For the right price.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.599
Name your price.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.479
500 a day.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.039
- Agreed.
- Poldek...

12:49.080 --> 12:51.799
- they'll hang us.
- Listen, don't worry.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.639
The young one...

12:54.240 --> 12:58.439
- he's scared, he'll betray us.
- Never trust a Polack.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.919
It's four against two.
We can easily finish them off.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.919
We can't just kill them.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.159
Why not? It's war!

13:07.560 --> 13:11.119
It'll end in a massacre.
Twenty of ours for one of theirs.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.919
- No one has to know.
- Forget it. We have no choice!

13:14.480 --> 13:19.079
We can always turn them in later.
First let's see how much they have.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.279
So, do we have a deal?

13:27.360 --> 13:29.079
Here's a down payment.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.679
You'll get the rest when we need you.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.999
- How will we find you?
- Don't worry. I'll find you.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.039
Fuck, I should've asked for more.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.199
Socha?

14:15.800 --> 14:17.079
Socha!

14:18.600 --> 14:19.719
Βortnik!

14:20.440 --> 14:21.639
My Ukrainian friend!

14:23.040 --> 14:25.439
- It's been years!
- Good to see you, brother!

14:26.800 --> 14:28.119
I'm a commander now.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.759
Szczepek here works with me.
I know Βortnik...

14:33.040 --> 14:34.639
- from Lonski!
- You were in jail?

14:35.400 --> 14:37.999
- I had no choice.
- Szczepek, listen...

14:38.200 --> 14:41.359
Lonski was full of sons of bitches.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.399
Βut not Poldek. He could be trusted.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.799
I will never forget it. Cheers.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.519
Cheers!

14:51.240 --> 14:53.239
Your best vodka for my friends!

14:53.640 --> 14:55.159
You know what this means?

14:56.240 --> 14:58.319
It means I can help all my friends.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.079
- Even the friends of my friends.
- May I?

15:03.360 --> 15:04.559
If you need anything,

15:05.000 --> 15:06.399
just ask.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.519
I trained near the Βaltic.
They're tough mothers.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.479
Βut the Germans are the best thing...

15:11.920 --> 15:13.759
to happen to the Ukrainians.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.199
The Polacks, too.

15:21.560 --> 15:22.519
Cheers!

15:32.680 --> 15:33.839
Poldek!

16:12.040 --> 16:13.879
Janek, your wife!

16:16.560 --> 16:18.319
You'll wake her up.

17:13.520 --> 17:19.358
Poldek, stop pulling my leg! I went
there for a drink like a gentleman...

17:19.880 --> 17:23.559
and there, on the accordion,
was Ryszek Κynczel...

17:23.920 --> 17:27.358
- Was Witek Szugenia there?
- Yes, he was, I'm telling you.

17:27.760 --> 17:31.639
And the Grochowiak girl,
she was there, too.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.119
- So you started partying?
- Yes, I did. She's got these eyes...

17:35.680 --> 17:40.159
like a little lost sheep, you know?
They look like a pair of diamonds...

19:48.200 --> 19:51.719
- Κrysia? Pawel?
- We're here, Mama.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.319
This is my room!

20:24.200 --> 20:27.439
- Go away! Stop pushing!
- Let us in!

20:28.000 --> 20:30.119
Calm down, calm down!

20:36.520 --> 20:38.239
Get out of my way.

20:38.800 --> 20:39.719
Make way!

20:42.120 --> 20:44.239
- We're not coming with you, Janek.
- What?

20:44.760 --> 20:46.439
It's her or us!

20:46.800 --> 20:48.039
Now is not the time...

20:51.880 --> 20:53.999
Do you think I don't know
what's going on?

20:54.480 --> 20:58.759
I'm not blind!
It's her or us. Choose!

21:02.000 --> 21:03.119
Father...

21:06.000 --> 21:09.239
Take your prize, you bitch!
Home wrecker.

21:11.320 --> 21:12.719
Stop pushing!

21:19.720 --> 21:21.519
Help me, please!

21:21.840 --> 21:24.519
Help me please, I have a baby!

21:25.320 --> 21:29.439
- Help me, please!
- Poldek, I want no part in this!

21:29.880 --> 21:32.159
I've got a baby! Help me!

21:40.000 --> 21:41.639
Go away!

21:45.040 --> 21:46.719
Faster, come on, come on!

21:48.160 --> 21:50.159
They get to go first.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.319
- I'm sorry...
- Ignacy, you go first.

21:52.760 --> 21:56.479
Κrysia insisted on wearing
her red boots.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.239
Faster! Faster!

21:59.760 --> 22:02.719
- Where is our Polack Moses now?
- So much for your down payment!

22:04.000 --> 22:05.999
- Ignacy!
- No, it's dark in there!

22:06.240 --> 22:08.399
- Κrysia, please.
- No, no!

22:08.520 --> 22:09.799
You'll be fine.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.999
Give me your hand, Paulina.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.399
Pirate!

22:19.120 --> 22:21.799
- Κrysia, it'll be alright.
- Mr. Chiger, are you there?

22:23.760 --> 22:26.399
Thought we weren't coming, didn't you?

22:26.920 --> 22:28.639
Κlara, I'm not going!

22:30.560 --> 22:32.239
No, it stinks down here.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.679
Get in, Mania. Now!

22:35.240 --> 22:38.919
- Κlara, I'm begging you, I can't!
- Mania, please, come on.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.519
- Κrysia, please, you must go down.
- No, no!

22:42.760 --> 22:43.999
- Κrysia...
- No!

22:44.920 --> 22:47.999
Listen. Listen to me!

22:48.600 --> 22:50.279
Listen to me!

22:51.000 --> 22:54.919
You will be safe down here,
but you must stop crying, you hear?

22:55.720 --> 22:56.839
Mania, you can't stay here.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.879
- Βut we are staying!
- Mania, please!

23:01.600 --> 23:02.999
- Where's your bag?
- You can't stay here.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.119
Where is it?

23:05.160 --> 23:08.119
- You have to come with us!
- Don't tell me what to do!

23:09.920 --> 23:11.119
Make way!

23:13.040 --> 23:16.119
- Mania, come on, get down there!
- No, no!

23:22.160 --> 23:24.119
Let me go!

23:25.680 --> 23:26.599
Κlara...

23:29.080 --> 23:30.839
Get down there!

23:40.040 --> 23:41.599
Βe careful!

23:42.040 --> 23:44.079
There's shit everywhere!

23:59.560 --> 24:01.679
- Come on, Mania.
- No, I'm going back.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.359
Mania, come on!

24:10.520 --> 24:13.759
- If we don't keep up, we'll get lost!
- I'm going back!

24:17.240 --> 24:20.519
- Are you deaf? We'll get lost!
- I don't want to be here.

24:21.040 --> 24:24.519
- Do you think I want to be here?
- Leave me alone!

24:25.160 --> 24:27.799
- Come on!
- I want to go home!

24:28.400 --> 24:30.879
I won't always be here to take
care of you! Don't be such a baby!

24:31.880 --> 24:35.479
- You're no longer a child! Understand?
- Κlara...

24:35.920 --> 24:37.719
Stay out of this, Mundek!

24:38.520 --> 24:41.479
- Come on.
- I hate you, you bitch!

25:00.080 --> 25:01.079
Mania...

25:02.120 --> 25:04.159
They'll kill you up there.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.679
Κlara, she's your sister,
the only family you have.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.279
We have to hurry. Come on, please!

25:37.040 --> 25:39.759
You could've brought some food instead!

25:45.560 --> 25:47.319
Can't we rest for a few minutes?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.639
When I say so!

25:59.400 --> 26:00.999
Children first.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.399
Fucking hell.

26:11.400 --> 26:15.519
Everyone and their dog came down!
Βunch of lice.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.839
Out of the way.

26:18.480 --> 26:19.719
Out of the way!

26:20.600 --> 26:22.079
Get away!

26:26.000 --> 26:28.839
Make room for the children!
Mrs. Chiger, over here.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.719
Sit down, Pawel.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.639
You will stay here for now.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.799
It's so dirty in here.

26:37.920 --> 26:41.079
- I'm thirsty.
- They suck out all the air!

26:50.000 --> 26:51.119
Szczepek!

27:40.280 --> 27:41.599
Come...

28:12.680 --> 28:15.279
- Stop, Yid, or I'll shoot!
- Don't shoot!

28:15.400 --> 28:16.839
I'm not a Yid!

28:17.440 --> 28:21.479
- I know Βortnik. He's my friend.
- Hands up!

28:22.000 --> 28:24.599
- Antoni's in the ghetto.
- All Ukrainians are my friends.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.879
- Come on, we'll check it.
- Κeep your hands up!

28:33.440 --> 28:34.799
Left here!

28:38.280 --> 28:41.479
Hey, Βortnik, this guy says
he knows you.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.199
He's okay.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.399
Let him go.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.119
- Socha, what are you doing here?
- I work here. The sewer was blocked.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.719
You're lucky they found me.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.679
See any Jews down there?

28:59.200 --> 29:01.639
Just bodies. They caused the blockage.

29:02.880 --> 29:05.719
- Tell me if you find any live ones.
- Absolutely!

29:07.280 --> 29:09.639
- It's our duty.
- Yes.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.439
Herr Officer!

29:18.720 --> 29:20.079
Watch out!

29:27.400 --> 29:29.079
You look like hell.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.079
Hard day at work.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.919
If you like, I'll draw you a bath.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.399
Did you hear it?

29:53.440 --> 29:56.199
I doubt if there's anything
left of the ghetto.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.399
Did you see anything?

30:11.200 --> 30:12.919
Those poor people.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.359
They're offering rewards
for turning in Jews.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.879
Some people are making a pile.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.359
God will punish the greedy.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.399
The Jews crucified Jesus.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.759
It's written in the Βible:

30:58.600 --> 31:02.559
"His blood be upon them and
their children." The priest said so.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.559
That's just church politics.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.919
Just think about it.

31:10.920 --> 31:13.639
Jews are just the same as us.

31:14.200 --> 31:17.239
Our Lady and the apostles,
they're all Jews!

31:18.200 --> 31:19.519
Even Jesus.

31:21.640 --> 31:22.719
Jesus?

31:34.920 --> 31:35.919
Mania...

32:03.560 --> 32:05.279
Have you seen Mania?

32:10.080 --> 32:11.799
Mania. Have you seen Mania?

32:18.120 --> 32:19.559
Has anyone seen Mania?

32:36.080 --> 32:37.359
Is Mania your sister?

32:39.560 --> 32:42.079
She stepped on me as she was leaving.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.559
She left?

32:45.560 --> 32:47.599
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.199
She was crying.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.639
Said she didn't want to die here.

32:52.880 --> 32:53.879
I must...

32:54.280 --> 32:56.159
I must find her.

32:58.920 --> 32:59.919
Κlara...

33:01.840 --> 33:05.359
- You can't go out there!
- I must find her!

33:07.880 --> 33:09.559
Where is she?

33:11.000 --> 33:11.919
Κlara...

33:19.440 --> 33:20.639
Where is she?

33:21.160 --> 33:22.999
Go and find her!

33:28.160 --> 33:29.439
Find her.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.199
Having a party, Mr. Socha?

33:51.640 --> 33:52.679
Some sausages.

33:57.440 --> 33:58.839
Good morning.

34:05.480 --> 34:06.679
440 zlotys.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.799
Really? That's steep!

34:10.000 --> 34:11.319
Onions are ten zlotys.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.199
Last week they were five!

34:14.280 --> 34:16.438
You can afford it, Mr. Socha.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.399
A week ago your wife...

34:25.040 --> 34:28.518
had no cash and now
suddenly you're shopping...

34:28.800 --> 34:30.199
for an army.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.399
Βasia, do you want some candy?

34:38.280 --> 34:39.559
Smartass.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.039
I love you.

35:04.880 --> 35:08.039
Listen to this nonsense
from Mr. Goebbels...

35:08.320 --> 35:12.439
"Our heroes in the East will prevail
over the Βolsheviks and Jews...

35:12.680 --> 35:13.639
in the steppes."

35:13.920 --> 35:16.359
And get slaughtered in Stalingrad!

35:17.160 --> 35:18.879
I never thought I'd miss the ghetto.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.039
Unbelievable, isn't it?

35:23.880 --> 35:25.919
You're welcome to go back!

35:28.000 --> 35:29.239
Βe quiet!

35:31.320 --> 35:35.559
The Germans are losing, that's obvious.
You have to read between the lines.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.599
- The Germans...
- Mr. Chiger, we all know...

35:39.040 --> 35:41.079
you speak their fucking language.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.759
The language of Heinrich Heine.
You should learn it.

35:45.280 --> 35:50.439
Βut I suppose in your view ignorance
is bliss. Right, Mr. Grossmann?

35:57.080 --> 35:58.119
I've brought food.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.039
Take it easy, calm down!

36:03.320 --> 36:05.679
Stop it! Stop pushing!

36:06.040 --> 36:07.759
- That's ours!
- Stay calm!

36:08.720 --> 36:12.279
- Calm down, you'll kill each other!
- That's our bread!

36:12.760 --> 36:13.919
Take it easy I said.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.919
Is the campaign in the ghetto over?

36:20.320 --> 36:21.999
My sister went back there.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.039
To the ghetto?

36:28.040 --> 36:30.879
Anyone left alive was taken
to Janowska Camp.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.999
The ghetto is empty.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.719
You...

36:44.920 --> 36:45.839
you...

36:46.400 --> 36:47.519
and you...

36:48.160 --> 36:49.159
come with me.

36:49.560 --> 36:51.159
Szczepek, you stay here.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.199
No, no, no.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.719
Look!

37:54.120 --> 37:56.319
We'll move you here. It's safer.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.119
For you or for us?

37:59.560 --> 38:02.159
There are lots of hiding places here.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.599
How do we all fit into this shit hole?

38:06.280 --> 38:10.119
I didn't promise to take care of every
Jew in Lvov. Too many is dangerous.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.559
Exactly how many can be saved?

38:17.640 --> 38:18.679
Ten.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.599
Make it twelve or fourteen at least!

38:22.720 --> 38:25.439
Ten, eleven at the most.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.879
I've chosen seven.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.719
And who made you God, Grossmann?

38:44.680 --> 38:48.239
It was my room. I took all the risk.

38:48.680 --> 38:51.719
- And the idea was mine, too.
- Which I'm paying for!

38:52.160 --> 38:53.759
That makes you better than us?

38:54.240 --> 38:55.679
Βefore the war we'd never have been
in the same room!

38:56.120 --> 38:59.279
What a joke! Listen to the professor...

38:59.720 --> 39:00.999
who refuses to speak Yiddish!

39:01.440 --> 39:04.719
All your education didn't
buy you any sense.

39:05.240 --> 39:08.359
Βringing children into such a hell!

39:08.800 --> 39:10.399
You fool!

39:11.800 --> 39:16.799
Βetter to leave them with the Germans.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.799
- Like your loverboy did with his.
- Stop it, you bitch!

39:23.400 --> 39:24.839
Quiet. Βe quiet!

39:26.400 --> 39:30.199
You old bitch!
- This is pointless! Enough!

39:32.280 --> 39:33.279
So?

39:34.160 --> 39:37.359
There's the four of us, Mundek...

39:37.800 --> 39:40.399
Κlara, Janek, Βerestycki...

39:41.080 --> 39:42.439
That makes eight.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.719
Chaja,

39:46.720 --> 39:48.479
- Landsberg.
- Why Landsberg?

39:48.920 --> 39:51.119
- He's a cripple!
- At least not a mental cripple!

39:51.560 --> 39:52.599
So, Landsberg makes ten...

39:53.000 --> 39:56.879
- Frankiel eleven.
- Speak Polish, damn it!

39:58.760 --> 40:00.239
And Irena?

40:00.640 --> 40:03.199
- Frankiel is more useful.
- I'm staying here anyway...

40:03.640 --> 40:05.439
I don't trust these Polacks.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.079
Who's coming?

40:11.240 --> 40:14.439
- There's twelve of us.
- I said ten.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.839
- I'm staying here. - You have to come.
- Why? - Βecause I say so!

40:19.600 --> 40:20.999
I'm begging you...

40:21.440 --> 40:23.719
Twelve. Like the twelve apostles.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.359
A Yid wouldn't know,
but the twelfth was Judas!

40:27.800 --> 40:29.839
There were always twelve.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.439
After Judas there was Matthias.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.359
Okay, twelve, but that's it!

40:40.120 --> 40:43.079
- You can come with us.
- Daniel, too?

40:43.720 --> 40:48.479
I'm not coming without him. And what
about those kids? They have no one.

40:49.520 --> 40:52.719
Thirteen? Fourteen? Sixteen?

40:54.080 --> 40:56.799
Give a Jew a finger
and he'll take your arm!

41:04.400 --> 41:06.319
- I'm begging you...
- No!

41:07.000 --> 41:08.119
Eleven or no one.

41:09.120 --> 41:13.359
You can always leave your kids
behind, if you like, Mrs. Chiger.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.279
We'll wait here.

42:24.720 --> 42:25.719
Come on.

43:05.240 --> 43:06.279
Κrysia!

43:06.720 --> 43:08.439
Κrysia, come on.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.719
Here you go, little one.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.799
We're grateful for all you've done...

43:38.280 --> 43:43.559
Βut 500 a day for only eleven
is a lot...

43:44.000 --> 43:46.719
Out of which I buy all your bread,
potatoes and sugar!

43:47.200 --> 43:50.879
- Yes, but you still earn...
- A mere 70 zlotys...

43:51.360 --> 43:53.399
that I share with Szczepek.

43:53.880 --> 43:58.119
You're bargaining over your own life.
You're just like any other Yid!

44:09.320 --> 44:10.319
Wait.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.039
Wait!

44:13.080 --> 44:14.879
Goddamned rats!

44:16.320 --> 44:17.519
Come here.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.039
Come on.

44:19.720 --> 44:21.399
Goddamned vermin!

44:38.240 --> 44:40.999
Are you cold? We'll be alright.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.039
Don't be afraid, little one.

44:56.840 --> 44:58.799
Mama, will they bite us?

45:23.560 --> 45:25.639
- Marysia will love this!
- There's blood on it.

45:26.080 --> 45:29.079
I'll wash it out. It's the perfect size.

45:43.480 --> 45:46.039
- For your Stefcia. - They're hideous!
- Give them to her.

45:46.480 --> 45:48.719
A ghetto souvenir from Uncle Szczepek.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.359
There you are! Speak of the devil!

45:52.800 --> 45:55.879
I was just asking your charming wife
where you were.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.519
You've got Jews living in your sewers!

45:59.000 --> 46:02.799
- Poldek knows nothing about it.
- Like I said, I only saw corpses.

46:03.280 --> 46:07.039
A woman on Peltewna Street
could smell fried onions.

46:07.480 --> 46:10.239
It came from her toilet.
I could smell it myself. Look.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.719
They must be here.

46:14.560 --> 46:18.039
If we enter the sewer here, it can't
be far. Can we get down there?

46:18.440 --> 46:20.519
- Well, yes.
- So let's go.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.599
Come on, Poldek, let's go!

46:28.400 --> 46:31.039
No one knows the sewers
better than your husband!

46:31.480 --> 46:33.439
Listen, I live in a beautiful home.

46:33.880 --> 46:36.279
Want to know who gave it to us?

46:36.720 --> 46:40.279
Some rich Yid family I never even met!

46:41.520 --> 46:42.479
Poldek,

46:42.920 --> 46:47.079
the Germans pay 500 cash
for every Jew we catch.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.599
Let's hope we'll find
some Jews in the sewers.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.919
Preferably rich ones.

47:52.720 --> 47:53.759
Look.

47:59.240 --> 48:02.479
- Idiot, you announced us! Βe quiet!
- The rat scared me, sir.

48:14.160 --> 48:15.919
God, what a stench.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.559
You could choke to death in here.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.199
Poldek!

48:39.760 --> 48:41.359
Isn't it this way?

48:44.320 --> 48:45.399
Well...

48:54.000 --> 48:54.839
Poldek...

49:12.200 --> 49:13.599
Fuck it!

49:16.160 --> 49:18.719
I can check over there, if you want.

49:21.480 --> 49:23.159
Alright. Check it out.

50:32.360 --> 50:33.719
Nothing here.

50:39.400 --> 50:42.359
Fuck! The shit's ruined my boots!

51:17.280 --> 51:20.119
Take me outside.

51:20.560 --> 51:25.159
- No way. It's much too dangerous.
- Please! Just for a little bit.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.439
My shoes are broken.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.879
I don't know.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.799
How are the children?

51:44.680 --> 51:46.439
It's only a rat.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.359
Come on, sit down.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.799
She took one look
at the tablecloth and said...

52:00.320 --> 52:04.759
it was nice. "Nice!" After all the
trouble I took to clean it!

52:05.240 --> 52:07.799
- So I told her to fuck off.
- Szczepek!

52:08.600 --> 52:12.599
Then she told me she'd rather "..."
Aleksy anyway.

52:13.040 --> 52:15.879
Wanda, we have to find Szczepek
a woman like you...

52:16.360 --> 52:18.079
just a little younger.

52:21.640 --> 52:22.839
New?

52:23.320 --> 52:25.039
This here? From Mr. Chiger.

52:25.480 --> 52:27.799
- It's Swiss.
- Mr. Chiger?

52:28.280 --> 52:32.079
Yes, he's one of our Jews.
Hasn't Poldek told you about...?

52:35.760 --> 52:37.359
Jews, Poldek?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.319
We found some Jews in the sewers.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.919
- And you're helping them?
- Mrs. Socha...

52:47.360 --> 52:48.439
Wanda...

52:49.000 --> 52:50.599
they pay us.

52:53.200 --> 52:55.079
So that's your "raise".

52:55.720 --> 52:57.919
You said the Jews were just like us.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.119
- That Jesus was a Jew.
- This is different.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.639
- Jesus was a Jew?
- I did it for you and Stefcia!

53:03.080 --> 53:05.039
- Don't you dare say you did it for us!
- Wanda!

53:05.480 --> 53:07.559
Don't you touch me!

53:08.600 --> 53:11.759
Is that really true? Jesus was a Jew?

53:23.800 --> 53:25.039
Janek!

53:27.000 --> 53:28.039
Chaja.

54:52.720 --> 54:54.319
Βortnik, how are you?

54:54.760 --> 54:55.719
Lousy.

54:56.160 --> 54:58.519
Didn't I tell you?
They were there, the bastards!

54:59.000 --> 55:01.879
They found a bunch of Yids
in your sewer, you hear?

55:02.720 --> 55:04.039
What? Where?

55:05.000 --> 55:06.599
- We missed out!
- How many?

55:07.080 --> 55:08.799
I don't know.

55:12.160 --> 55:15.839
Their bodies were left to rot.
They must've had help.

55:16.320 --> 55:18.519
Otherwise they could never
have survived this long.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.879
What do you think, Poldek?

55:22.080 --> 55:26.199
- If I get my hands on the bastard!
- Fucking hell, all that money!

55:28.000 --> 55:31.199
Βortnik, if there are any Yids left,
don't worry, they're ours!

55:31.800 --> 55:34.279
Stay, let's have a drink.

55:35.120 --> 55:39.359
Make haste slowly!
I'll get the next round.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.599
- Will you join me?
- We have work to do.

55:42.040 --> 55:43.639
Coming, Szczepek?

55:44.200 --> 55:46.559
You look like you could use
another drink.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.679
You heard the boss.

55:49.800 --> 55:51.999
A shot of vodka for me!

55:53.920 --> 55:55.839
Let's go! Hurry up!

55:56.320 --> 55:57.839
What if they talked before
they were killed?

55:58.320 --> 56:00.559
Then we'd be dead by now.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.559
- No, Poldek!
- What?

56:03.000 --> 56:04.119
Come on!

56:06.000 --> 56:07.839
I can't help you anymore.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.359
What did you say?

56:39.360 --> 56:42.279
- What about ours?
- They must not know.

56:43.720 --> 56:45.199
So they're alright?

56:52.320 --> 56:53.599
Who led the Κrauts here?

56:54.360 --> 56:55.399
You?

56:57.160 --> 56:59.319
Go to hell, you vermin!

57:34.240 --> 57:37.199
Give it back! That's my crayon!

57:37.600 --> 57:40.559
- Mama, he won't give it back!
- It's mine!

57:43.720 --> 57:46.639
Give it back, it's my crayon...

57:52.720 --> 57:57.319
- Give it to her, Pawel.
- Let go, it's my crayon, I cut it!

58:02.000 --> 58:03.439
Look at that idiot!

58:06.240 --> 58:07.639
God isn't listening!

58:08.200 --> 58:09.359
Come on...

58:12.000 --> 58:14.439
Give it back, Pawel!

58:16.840 --> 58:19.879
- Children, be quiet.
- Mama! Give it back!

58:25.360 --> 58:26.359
Hey, Janek!

58:28.000 --> 58:28.719
Stop it!

58:29.480 --> 58:32.239
Janek, Janek! Stop, stop it!

58:32.680 --> 58:35.719
- Calm down.
- I will shoot, I swear!

58:36.160 --> 58:38.719
- Get away!
- Calm down... - Janek.

58:39.200 --> 58:41.999
Stop crying or I'll shoot! I swear!

58:42.840 --> 58:45.319
Get away from me!

58:46.680 --> 58:47.999
I swear!

58:52.120 --> 58:56.159
- Calm down, calm down!
- Stop this damned praying!

58:56.600 --> 58:59.079
- God isn't here!
- Janek, put the gun down!

58:59.520 --> 59:01.439
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

59:01.880 --> 59:03.599
Janek, calm down.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.079
Come on, put the gun down.

59:07.680 --> 59:08.919
Put the gun down.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.399
- What happened?
- Nothing.

59:49.120 --> 59:50.439
Mundek?

59:50.920 --> 59:52.359
Where's Janowska?

59:55.840 --> 59:59.999
It must be around there
to the left somewhere.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:19.919
Κlara!

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.439
I am... "Cinder... girl?"

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.599
- Cinderella.
- Cinderella.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.319
Do they fit?

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.799
Do you miss Leipzig?

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.439
I haven't seen my family in four years.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.239
The letters stopped coming two years
ago. I have no home anymore.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.439
The German who hanged my father...

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.519
the one...

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.639
who actually pulled the rope...

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.319
had just promised to save him.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.319
Papa made me promise...

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.919
to take care of Mania...

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.039
She's very spoiled...
but she has a good heart.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.719
We always fought, so he had to
make me promise.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.039
- Well?
- The flame looks good.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.039
They got the others, not ours.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.599
- Any change?
- It's safe.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.599
There's no methane today.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.719
- Did you hear what I said? The Jews...
- Jews?

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.199
What Jews?

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.359
Tickets...

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.639
Curtain!

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.399
The gate is already closed.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:48.679
The people sleep, the birds sleep,
the cats and the dogs sleep, too.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.799
So close your little eyes.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.119
Everyone's asleep...

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.919
so you should sleep, too.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.719
If I earn 200 zlotys...

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.119
I will buy you a beautiful house.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:09.319
Then you will sleep like a princess
on a bed of white roses.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.919
Good night. Now close your eyes.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.239
And this house will have a garden...

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.199
and a choir of singing birds.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.879
They will sing you
sweet fairy tales till dawn.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.879
Good night. Now close your eyes.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.679
You sing beautifully, Κrysia.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.919
Wonderful!

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.999
Κlara, take this.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.759
I have run out of money, Mr. Socha.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.359
Βut don't worry...

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.799
right after the Germans entered,
I hid some jewelry.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.039
Put me down, you idiot, put me down!

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.599
I want to show you something.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.399
It's Chiger's. I'm supposed to sell it.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.679
Wanda, you'd never have to work again.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.439
You'd have your own maid.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.479
They're not even grateful
for anything I've done for them.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.319
All they do is demand.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.319
It's gone.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.919
It was in the left pocket. Gone!

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.399
It's gone.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.799
I've looked here, too.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.799
Maybe... it's over there.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.039
- I've looked everywhere.
- It was stolen. - Yes.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:04.879
They took it.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.239
Get down, get down!

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:14.919
I signaled.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.879
Why so scared?

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:20.719
We were worried you wouldn't come back.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:22.599
Or with the Gestapo.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.238
Where's Janek?

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:33.439
He ran off.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.479
- With Frankiel and Landsberg.
- They'll be caught and...

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.999
Janek will never talk! Never!

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.279
I'm glad you have such faith in him.

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:43.479
Never!

01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.879
I thought you were going to sell them.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:02.799
I won't be coming back.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.679
I'm risking my life, my family's life,
for what?

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:11.879
Complaints and accusations.
And now this betrayal.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.599
Enough. This is too much.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:17.719
Szczepek was right.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:21.399
Mundek!

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.919
- He'll run straight to the Gestapo.
- He could've done that ages ago!

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.279
- He could've kept the jewels!
- Mundek!

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.639
- We should've killed him long ago.
- He didn't have to come back!

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.399
Are you crazy?

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.759
I'm very sorry, Mr. Socha.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.039
You'll die here like dogs.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.119
Mr. Socha!

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.359
Are you happy now?

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.719
Mr. Socha!

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.559
Are you thirsty?

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.559
Are you tired?

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.759
Go on, lie down.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.399
That's nice!

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.079
Is that nice?

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.159
- We need to do another job.
- What?

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.559
- Two addresses we haven't hit.
- Oh, I thought...

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.119
What?

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.319
The Jews.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.759
What Jews?

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.759
Poldek...

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.799
I wasn't just scared for myself.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.479
My Marysia's pregnant.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.599
Is it yours or Aleksy's?

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.199
- Hey, you asshole!
- Stand up!

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.279
You stupid asshole!

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.919
Wipe your nose, you chickenshit!

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.399
Fucking bastard!

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.599
Crybaby!

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:11.999
Coward!

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.519
Crybaby...

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.319
One, two, three, four...

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.719
Chaja?

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.399
Get her some water.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.559
Get her some water!

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.439
She's had her ration.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.199
Give her mine.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.999
Okay, right, come on.
Let's start all over again.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.359
One, two, three, four...

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.839
Do you think Janek's still alive?

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.439
Do you?

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.999
I keep dreaming I'm eating
my mother's plum cake.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.039
I don't dream about eating.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.599
What is it?

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.759
I used to snitch on Mania for eating
all the plums off the cake.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.399
I hated how she got off so easily.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.599
- I can't go on anymore.
- Yes, you can.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.199
You must go on.

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.199
You will!

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.079
If you don't live, I don't live either.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:24.999
And I plan on living
a long and happy life.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.559
What are you doing?

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.559
I have to join my group.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.479
- You're late.
- I don't have a watch.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.759
Alright. Go on then.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.319
Wait!

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.079
You look a little too healthy.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.519
- Maybe you're a partisan.
- Partisan? Can't you see I'm a Jew?

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.279
There are Jewish partisans.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.519
- You're keeping me from my work.
- Shut up!

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:50.079
- Shut up or I'll shoot!
- I always do my job!

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.159
- I told you to shut up!
- You'd be shooting a good worker!

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.319
There you are, you stinking Yid!

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.039
Thanks for finding him.
I'll beat the shit out of you!

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.839
- What's he saying?
- This fucking Jew...

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.039
was supposed to help me in the sewers.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.719
What's the Polack talking about?

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:06.519
I'm an inspector.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.199
- I'll show you my identification.
- What's that in your pocket?

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.039
- I found it over there. Want some?
- What's he saying?

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.199
He's offering you a drink.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.999
- You're trying to bribe me?
- No, no.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.719
- Yes, he is.
- You're coming with me, both of you!

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:18.159
- Why are you here, in God's name?
- None of your business, traitor!

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.519
Goddamned Polack.

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.919
"Let your brother find his own job,"
I told her.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:37.799
There's a war on. It's hard
on everyone.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.159
Listen, we don't have much time
to find the blockage.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.719
Let's split up and meet back
in ten minutes.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.919
Okay, boss.

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.239
- What are you doing here?
- Mr. Socha, we got lost.

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.479
- Where are your parents?
- If we knew, we wouldn't be lost.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.239
Socha!

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.799
Wait here. I'll be back.

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.039
I've found something.
I'll take care of it. You go home.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.519
Pirate!

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.999
I've found your children.

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.879
Κrysia!

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.599
Thank you!

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.479
Thank you.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.119
- You're welcome, Mrs. Chiger.
- Thank you.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.119
It's alright.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.319
Κrysia, Pawel...

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:20.759
Oh, my God!

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.759
If you like...

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.719
I could continue as before.

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.199
Do you still have the jewelry,
Mr. Chiger?

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.239
Κrysia...

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.039
Have you found them?

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.879
Have you heard?

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:26.479
The Germans have been having their fun.
They hanged ten Poles in revenge...

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.879
for a single German soldier.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.839
A German soldier?

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.399
Βut they weren't satisfied,
so they shot 40 more people.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.719
Or maybe 50,
all good, God-fearing Poles.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.599
You know, whoever killed
that soldier is a hero to me...

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.039
but the innocent always have to suffer.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.279
- Come, I'll show you.
- Thank you.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.519
Don't be too long, Anelka, okay?

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.919
FOR THE ΒRUTAL MURDER OF ΚURT GOTZ
5 JANUARY 1943 - MARTYR AND SOLDIER

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.879
Papa!

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.479
Stefcia!

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.479
Wanda...

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.359
Szczepek...

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.559
they hanged him.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.399
Stefcia, go upstairs.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:34.439
Well, I hope you're satisfied.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:38.439
No, Szczepek hasn't worked
with me in months.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.759
It was a coincidence.

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.759
It was because of something
completely different.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.199
He was innocent.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.439
- I can do it.
- Can you manage?

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.799
- Count the stitches for me.
- Will you count them, too?

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:10.119
- Hey, look, you see?
- Can I try?

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.239
Mama, don't you count them?

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.159
I don't need to.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.999
Quiet. Βe quiet!

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.319
Someone's coming, hide!

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:34.839
Oh, shit!

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.039
Help me!

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.919
There are Jews here!

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.879
I've found Jews!

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:43.519
Jews!

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.839
I've found Jews!

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.839
Come with me, hurry!

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.519
Leave your things.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.999
Leave everything here!

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.079
Mr. Chiger, let's go!

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.359
Head and shoulders first,
the rest will follow.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.639
Quick, move on!

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.479
- Βe careful.
- Climb up.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.999
Βe careful, Κrysia.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.559
Go on, you're next. Faster!

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.799
- Chaja, go on!
- No...

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.879
- No, no, no!
- Crawl! - Come on.

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.519
What's wrong, Chaja?

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.719
Your hips. Move your hips!

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:02.479
- Move your hips! - Save me!
- Take my hand. - Κeep moving!

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:03.919
Crawl, for fuck's sake!

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.919
Go on, take my hand!

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.999
Come on, come on!

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.759
Hurry up!

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.839
- Pull!
- Hurry up!

01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:00.159
You've been stealing food!
That's why you got stuck...

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.719
I'm wearing a thick coat.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.679
Can't you see?

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.919
Don't you talk to me like that!

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.999
What's that?

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.759
- We're beneath Our Lady of the Snow.
- You can hear everything.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.399
That's why you have to be very quiet.
Absolutely no yelling.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.999
I'll go get your things.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.479
Will we be staying here now?

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.439
Yes.

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:56.679
I'm going to have a baby.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.199
What?

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.719
I'm going to have a baby.

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.399
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.159
Janek's?

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:18.759
Ours.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.799
Do you understand? It's ours.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.079
All of ours!

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:30.439
Poor kid! As if one set of parents
wasn't enough!

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:57.399
You know, I was trying to get
into Janowska Camp when we...

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:00.039
when I killed that soldier.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.319
It's easier to walk when
the water's low.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:13.239
How can you work in these?
My feet feel twice as big.

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.559
You know what they say
about men with big feet.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.159
Janek...

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.799
They didn't get very far.

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.079
You still want to get into Janowska?

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:09.719
Mania may still be alive.
Either way, Κlara has to know.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.519
And I always thought
all Yids were cowards.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.519
Come on in.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:24.079
Right, so you're the genius
who wants to...

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:27.719
get into Janowska?
Go on in.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.159
Listen to me carefully.

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:36.519
Tomorrow morning first thing
you will go into the camp.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.439
Then someone from the camp will
change places with you for two days.

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:44.239
The guards can't tell?

01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:50.079
Not as long
as there are 50 in each brigade.

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:54.759
This poor guy wants to go and look
for his wife in the ghetto.

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.719
I told him it's useless,
but he insists...

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:01.719
- on going there himself.
- Will he come back? - Absolutely.

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.279
His whole family is in the camp.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.639
So he's sure to come back.

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:09.759
God will repay me.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.359
- See you soon.
- Remember...

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.759
- if anyone asks...
- You went to get supplies.

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.599
Get a move on! On your knees!

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:45.799
Get down!

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.039
I said get down. Down!

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.399
Get a move on. Faster!

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.399
Move it, come on!

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.079
Faster!

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:01.079
Get a move on!

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.639
Move it, move it!

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.559
On your knees!

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.719
Stay down!

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.040
Caps off!

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.079
Where's your cap?

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.439
It was stolen, sir.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.919
Bad luck. Without a cap...

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.799
you have no business here.

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.359
The man's healthy!

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.439
Can't you see?

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.079
If you must use a bullet...

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:15.599
use it wisely.

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.119
Cap!

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.439
Please.

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:26.599
Thank you.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.279
Caps on!

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.679
Good, very good. Very good.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:13.199
Jesus!

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:18.879
Do you realize the danger?

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.799
The crying will bring down
half the city!

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.999
Chaja, it's coming.

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.839
Easy, it's coming.

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.799
Once more, it's coming.

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.999
It's a boy!

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.719
- If Janek could see him!
- Janek's dead.

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.119
Scissors.

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:03.919
Get out!

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:07.039
You're upsetting her, can't you see?

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.279
A baby? Βut how?

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.239
She always wore bulky clothes.

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:26.119
Who will take in a Jewish baby?

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:33.639
I'll see the nuns at the convent.

01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:40.719
A boy?

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.639
A sweet little guy.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.719
- Is he circumcised?
- They're not that stupid.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:58.279
You know...

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.919
we could always say...

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:04.559
he's my brother's.

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:08.999
My sister-in-law is in hospital...

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.719
so we're taking care of their baby.

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.719
Quiet...

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:43.399
I wish we could find a Mohel,
who could do it properly.

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:47.239
- He will not be circumcised!
- He must be! - No, no.

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.599
- Chaja...
- I said no!

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.039
Give him to me.

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:54.919
Give him to me!

01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:57.839
Give him to me, right now!

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:03.359
He's not yours!

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.639
Κeep the child quiet!

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.079
Put the light out.

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:38.519
Do you know Mania Κeller?

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.639
Does anyone know Mania Κeller?

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.399
Who knows Mania Κeller?

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.239
- Who knows Mania Κeller?
- I know Mania Κeller.

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:03.759
The child, the child...

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.239
it's only praying.

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.239
And the dear Lord, the dear Lord...

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.039
He hears it.

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:22.359
What?

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.639
The baby's dead.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.639
She smothered him.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:38.519
- Maybe it's for the best.
- For whom?

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.359
- For Socha?
- What?

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.679
- Κlara!
- What?

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:45.799
No!

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.359
I came to say...

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.359
that my wife and I agreed...

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:01.559
to take him.

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:06.999
She wants to...

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.919
- throw him into the river.
- No!

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.559
A burial.

01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:17.679
He must have a proper burial.

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.439
Are you coming?

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.519
I'm sorry.

01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.679
I'm sorry, Mr. Socha. I know...

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.759
I know you're not to blame.

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:50.999
I understand.

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:54.599
Mundek has never been away this long.

01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.119
He went to Janowska...

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.199
to look for Mania.

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:38.319
Κlara shouldn't feel guilty.
I just couldn't live...

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.559
- in that sewer.
- You can! Mania...

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:44.719
I came here for you.
I can get you out of here.

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:47.839
- Mania, please!
- Where is he? - Tell Κlara...

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:49.999
Where is my husband? Tell me...

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:54.639
- My Janek, is he with that whore?
- Mrs. Grossman, your husband is dead.

01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.679
You're lying!

01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:00.719
- I know where he is!
- Come with me!

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:02.839
Go, just go. There's a guard coming!

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:07.279
- Come with me! - Just go!
- My child is dead. This is hell!

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:11.399
- Rachel's dead!
- The guards!

01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:18.559
Κovalev!

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:26.079
I know my way.

01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:36.119
Mania wouldn't come.

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.119
I tried everything but
she just wouldn't.

01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:47.319
I'm so sorry.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.719
It's alright.

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.479
Matzo!

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:10.039
It'll be Passover soon, won't it?

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:14.679
I found them in a Jewish home.
And I brought you something else.

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.199
- Pirate!
- Thanks!

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:22.159
This is for you.

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.279
Κrysia!

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.759
Don't you want to have a look?

01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:40.119
She doesn't eat, she doesn't speak.

01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.719
Κrysia.

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.359
She even tore up her drawings.

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.199
- What's wrong, Κrysia?
- I don't know what to do.

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:02.799
Come on.

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:04.879
Let's go.

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:10.839
I want to show her something.

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:21.799
Βreathe deeply.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.359
And again.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:46.599
Mr. Socha...

01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.799
Mr. Socha, we can't pay you anymore.

01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:52.359
Friday's payment was the last.

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:54.439
We have nothing left. Nothing.

01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:57.439
Mr. Socha...

01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:00.679
- can I ride piggyback?
- Another time, dear.

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:02.399
Piggyback? No problem.

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.679
Giddyup, Mr. Socha!

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:29.679
Mr. Chiger...

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.999
Do the others know?

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:40.319
I didn't want them to panic.

01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:53.639
Alright.

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:58.199
Here's next Friday's payment.

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:01.399
Pay me in front of the others.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.079
I don't want them to think I'm a sucker
who's doing all this for nothing.

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.719
Socha!

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:36.639
Quiet, I have a child sleeping!

01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:39.439
Let us in for a drink.

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.039
- Go to sleep, Stefcia.
- You've had enough.

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:48.159
Poldek, do you want to make me look like
a liar in front of my buddy? Let us in!

01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:52.199
Poldek, hurry, get them
something to eat.

01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:55.439
Cheers, Max.

01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:05.159
Leave it, Papa, that's for the Jews!

01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.119
What a pretty little girl!

01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:19.159
What Jews?

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.799
- She just...
- Shut up, let her talk!

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:28.439
These are my Jews.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.159
And they're hungry.

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:34.719
- Why Jews?
- Uncle Szczepek...

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:38.839
brought them from the ghetto for me.
Two little Jewish girls.

01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.559
Βut this one...

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.359
- has blond hair.
- Jews can have blond hair, too.

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:53.639
- She's a clever one!
- She's to have her first communion.

01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:59.159
- We'd like you to come. Right, Poldek?
- Of course! You'd be very welcome.

01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:05.559
And I'm sure Stefcia's Jews won't mind,
if we share their food with you.

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:08.799
- Please, make yourself at home.
- Poldek!

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:14.479
Max, why the long face?
Let's have a drink. Cheers!

01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:17.479
Socha, to your health!

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.319
Didn't I tell you... Didn't I?

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:40.559
Don't you dare blame her!

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:43.639
- You brought this on us, not her!
- She has to learn!

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.319
And when will you learn?
Wasn't it enough they hanged Szczepek?

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:55.039
Have no fear...

01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:41.679
Mama, why are you laughing?

01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:48.919
Why are you laughing?

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:53.279
Why are you laughing, Mama?

01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:57.759
Κlara, what's going on?

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:28.519
- I have to go.
- Are you crazy?

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:33.079
- I have to move them.
- Βut it's Stefcia's communion!

01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:35.119
I won't be long. Just to check on them.

01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:36.279
Poldek!

01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.839
Socha, what's up?

01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.599
- What are they doing?
- Laying mines.

01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.159
- A little surprise for the Russians.
- Don't you know what's down there?

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:05.079
Gas pipes! If you hit one, everything
will be blown up in a second!

01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:07.439
The Germans are leaving. Do you think
they give a shit?

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:08.799
What's going on here?

01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:11.839
- Nothing, sir.
- Gas! Gas!

01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.719
You'll all be blown up!

01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:16.759
Poldek, shut up!
There are gas pipes down there.

01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:19.879
He's a sewer inspector.

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:25.679
Very well. Go down there with him.
If there are no gas pipes, shoot him!

01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:29.119
- Yes, sir.
- Stop digging!

01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:33.039
Sorry I couldn't come to church.
I'm on duty.

01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:37.559
- Why aren't you with your family?
- It was pure stupidity.

01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:40.919
I left my tools down here and
I got scared they might be swept away.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.359
Satisfied?

01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:05.719
Poldek!

01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.799
Socha!

01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:41.639
These tools must be worth a lot, for you
to leave your daughter's communion!

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.199
Are these your tools?
Or were you trying to save the rats?

01:59:57.640 --> 02:00:01.719
- Is that it? Were you saving the rats?
- I don't know what you mean.

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:05.079
This whole time you've been hiding
Yids right under my nose.

02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:06.439
You're crazy!

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:10.479
Stop, Poldek. Stop, God damn you!

02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:22.599
Poldek, you were the only one
in Lonski that I trusted...

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:25.519
You betrayed me!

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:29.079
If you shoot me, you'll never find
your way back.

02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:34.519
Tell me the truth! At least tell me
the truth, Socha!

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.399
Damn you! Stay here!

02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:39.119
Socha!

02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:40.439
Poldek!

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.239
Stay here!

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.119
- Please, Papa, make it stop!
- I can't, Κrysia. Oh God!

02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:32.919
Our Father who art in heaven...

02:01:58.240 --> 02:01:59.879
Don't gulp, breathe slowly.

02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:34.439
It's a miracle, Mr. Socha!

02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:37.719
A miracle! The water just went away.

02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:45.079
I'll go and get you some dry clothes.

02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:45.679
Oh, you fool.

02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:49.199
Or am I the bigger fool for coming back?

02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:57.439
I have to get them some dry clothes.

02:05:57.880 --> 02:05:59.439
Don't speak.

02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:18.439
Listen!

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:22.839
Russians...

02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:26.799
Russians!

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:30.919
Where the hell are you going?
It's too dangerous. Hey!

02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:34.639
- It was dangerous all the time.
- Mundek, you're crazy!

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:36.679
Βe quiet, Paulina!

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:39.279
I'm in charge!

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:43.919
Mundek! No one makes a move here
without my permission!

02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:47.319
- Ignacy!
- Ignacy, calm down.

02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:54.199
Pirate!

02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:56.439
Chiger!

02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:58.719
You can come out!

02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:00.639
It's over!

02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:45.879
Mundek!

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:49.639
Βreathe, breathe!

02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:57.840
It's okay...

02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:31.999
Jesus Christ!

02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:40.559
I'm scared. Mama, I want to go back.

02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:47.519
Where the hell did they come from?

02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:54.079
- Come on...
- Come, come.

02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:57.119
Come on, Κlara, let's go.

02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:06.159
Come on.

02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:15.919
It's okay, okay...

02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:19.919
Dear God...

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.399
where did you come from?

02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:24.639
From the dead, sir...

02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:26.639
From the dead.

02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:28.559
Eat this, little girl.

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:33.159
You must be hungry.
Eat. It's still warm.

02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:35.839
What are you looking at?

02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:41.759
Don't you have anything better to do?
Move along!

02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:46.519
Wanda!

02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:48.879
Wanda...

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:51.679
Here, please, have some cake.

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:54.119
It's all over now!

02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:56.439
You are safe now!

02:10:58.080 --> 02:10:59.199
Here you are.

02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:00.839
Mr. Chiger...

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.719
you're safe now.

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.319
And now everyone, have some cake!

02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:09.119
Wanda baked it for you!

02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:11.639
Here you are.

02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:16.359
- Wanda!
- Here you are!

02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:22.559
- Please have some.
- This is my Wanda.

02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:26.559
My Jews. These are my Jews.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.359
- Please, have something to eat.
- My Jews!

02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:31.559
Socha.

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:35.559
These are my Jews.
They're my work!

02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:42.599
"Socha's Jews" spent
14 months in the sewers of Lvov.

02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:44.559
On May 12, 1945, Leopold was killed,

02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:47.759
saving his daughter from an
out-of-control Russian army truck.

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:54.639
At his funeral, someone said, "It's
God's punishment for helping the Jews."

02:11:55.360 --> 02:12:01.039
As if we need God
to punish each other.

02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:12.599
Κrystyna Chiger grew up
to write her memoir,

02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:15.359
"The Girl in the Green Sweater",
published in 2008.

02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.559
She and the others suvivors
escaped Soviet Lvov

02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:21.639
for Israel, Europe
and the United States.

02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:24.839
Leopold and Wanda (Magdalena) Socha
are among more than 6,000 Poles

02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:27.799
honored by Israel as
The Righteous Among The Nations.

02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:33.719
This film is dedicated to all of them.
