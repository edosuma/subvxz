- Find her.

[Angelina] <i>You were right.
We're connected by the Callings.</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:28.737
I'm gonna help you follow God's mission.

00:28.737 --> 00:32.240
We are to detain every passenger
till further notice.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.242
No. I'm all he's got!

00:34.242 --> 00:36.786
Child protective services
will take care of him.

00:36.786 --> 00:37.704
Daddy!

00:37.704 --> 00:39.247
- I'll be back, okay?
- [Charlie] Daddy!

00:39.247 --> 00:42.500
I'm the captain. I did what I had to do.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.044
I'm not ready to die, Bill.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.547
Who said anything about dying?
I'll see you in 2024.

[Angelina] For me? Thank you.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.050
Cheers.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.261
What's wrong with your hand?

01:35.970 --> 01:36.805
Mmm.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.767
There's nothing wrong with it.
In fact, it's very right.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.103
It shows I've been chosen by God.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.854
Like you're special?

01:44.854 --> 01:45.772
Mm-hmm.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.400
If you're so special, why are you here?

01:50.485 --> 01:51.319
[sighs]

01:52.445 --> 01:54.739
'Cause I'm waiting for him
to send me a sign.

01:54.739 --> 01:58.159
And yesterday, for the first time
in a long time, he did.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.994
He made my hand glow.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.330
God needs me again.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.748
Needs you for what?

02:03.748 --> 02:07.460
To prepare for the day of judgment.
Final trial by fire.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.630
Is there anyone else like you?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.635
Yeah. Actually, there is one other person.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.723
All these months later,
it suddenly started glowing again.

02:20.723 --> 02:22.433
Hand me a wrench, will you?

02:24.686 --> 02:26.187
Mystical dragon scar.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.856
That's incredible.

The sink should be good.

02:34.445 --> 02:39.284
And that is how you fix a small drip.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.286
Got it. Easy enough.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.373
Hey, can I... Can I make you breakfast?

02:45.373 --> 02:48.293
Olive's spending the day volunteering
at Eden's school, so I got time.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.045
Oh, Cal, I... I wish I could stay
and keep you company,

02:51.045 --> 02:52.630
but I gotta go to work.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.300
My 22-year-old boss, who goes by "Pooter,"

02:55.300 --> 02:58.928
is considering putting me in charge
of the frozen food section.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.639
I hate that you had to go back to work
to help support us.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.142
And I hate that I can't work at all.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.560
I wanna help out.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.312
- I wanna go out--
- Cal.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.647
You are unique,

03:10.231 --> 03:12.025
even among 828ers.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.027
You have to be careful.

Zeke, I hate it here.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.941
Can't I just come stay with you instead?

03:53.858 --> 03:56.194
You'd just try to redecorate the place.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.613
And I like
the blinding, bright-white aesthetic.

03:58.613 --> 04:02.533
To say nothing of the infinite knowledge
of past and future part either.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.454
I wish I could tell you
everything that's gonna happen, Mick.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.997
- Tell me.
- [Zeke] I can't.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.252
If I tell you about the future,
it'll change your decisions.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.213
I can't risk messing with your free will.

[sentimental music plays]

04:23.429 --> 04:24.389
Sure.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.933
How far back do you wanna go?

04:28.059 --> 04:29.811
That moment we met in the cabin?

04:30.728 --> 04:31.604
Or earlier?

04:32.897 --> 04:34.107
What do you mean "earlier"?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.943
Remember how Angelina and Pete were
in the same photo as kids?

04:36.943 --> 04:37.860
Yeah.

04:37.860 --> 04:42.490
There were so many moments in our lives
when you and I almost met and had no idea.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.075
Like when?

04:44.867 --> 04:47.745
Rockefeller ice rink, 2007.
You almost slammed right into me,

04:47.745 --> 04:50.999
but at the last second,
you caught yourself. Sped right on by.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.959
- You're kidding.
- [Zeke] No.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.212
The day you bought your first box
of purple hair dye. [chuckles]

04:56.212 --> 04:59.299
- I was one aisle over, buying toothpaste.
- That's crazy.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.800
You know what's really crazy?

05:00.800 --> 05:05.013
I was at JFK the night 828
was supposed to return, driving my cab.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.598
How do you not remember that?

05:08.516 --> 05:11.185
I was doing airport pickups
pretty much every day.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.980
I mean,
by the time 828 was in the headlines,

05:14.522 --> 05:16.524
I couldn't remember
exactly where I'd been.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.110
But from here,

05:20.028 --> 05:20.987
I see it all.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.073
All the "almosts" we had.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.082
We both heard your voice saying...

05:33.082 --> 05:34.375
Find her.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.755
- You did. You found me.
- We finally got it right.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.633
God, I love you.

05:43.885 --> 05:47.597
You have no idea how hard it is
not to touch you. Not to just...

05:49.307 --> 05:51.934
wrap my arms around you and just feel you.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.479
I wish I could kiss you.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.563
Just...

05:57.440 --> 05:58.441
Zeke.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.738
Mick, this doesn't exactly
seem fair to you.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.575
As painful as it is to say,
maybe it's best for you--

06:07.575 --> 06:09.160
- No, Zeke, please.
- [knocking on door]

What the heck was that?

06:22.215 --> 06:26.010
Sorry, they said to just...
You're supposed to come with me.

06:30.848 --> 06:34.560
Our systems indicate you had a Calling
this morning at 8:14 a.m.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.771
We need every detail.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.606
How about this?

06:39.482 --> 06:43.111
How about I tell you
all about my stupid Calling

06:43.111 --> 06:46.114
after you help me track down my child?

06:46.697 --> 06:48.783
You remember him? Charlie?

06:49.283 --> 06:52.245
He's been in foster care
since you locked me up in here.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.205
I haven't seen him in months.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.998
Look, I get that you're frustrated.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.417
Oh, you think you get it.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.460
You have kids?

07:01.003 --> 07:03.047
Not yet. Someday.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.508
So, no, you don't get it.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.470
I lie awake every night,
wondering where he is.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.099
If he falls asleep
without some kind of light,

07:13.099 --> 07:14.684
he has nightmares.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.895
And he... he'll never admit it, but, uh...

07:19.939 --> 07:22.316
the only way he finds comfort
is in my arms.

07:22.316 --> 07:26.821
And I tell him, "It's okay, Charlie.
Sometimes, we're all afraid of the dark."

07:27.321 --> 07:29.157
I don't know
if he has a night-light anymore.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.201
Look, we'll do what we can
to track him down, okay?

07:33.077 --> 07:34.620
How about this, Mr. Butler?

07:34.620 --> 07:36.581
If we solve your Calling,

07:37.457 --> 07:40.835
then Lieutenant Vasquez will be authorized
to make some calls on your behalf.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.462
<i>If</i> you solve my Calling?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.505
The team's gonna solve this one.

07:44.505 --> 07:47.717
Mick, did you have a Calling?
What's going on?

07:47.717 --> 07:49.802
No. I have no idea.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.762
[Zimmer] Mr. Butler?

07:52.472 --> 07:53.431
The Calling.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.061
I saw a commercial work order.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.939
Some sort of city-authorized maintenance.

08:01.939 --> 08:05.485
Before all this,
I used to be a contractor, a good one.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.155
- Saw these documents all the time.
- What was it for?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.741
I don't know. Something had spilled on it.

08:12.825 --> 08:13.659
Ink, maybe?

08:14.494 --> 08:17.330
It was dimly lit, all eerie and shit.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.708
But I managed to make out a few numbers.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.545
Did you hear or feel anything by chance?

08:27.882 --> 08:28.841
The music.

08:29.884 --> 08:30.718
Violins?

08:33.387 --> 08:35.348
Like, classical.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.849
That's all I remember.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.861
Please solve this.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.739
I need to find my boy.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.331
- [door opens]
- Sorry, why am I here?

09:00.331 --> 09:02.124
Director Zimmer has agreed...

09:02.124 --> 09:04.001
On a trial basis...

09:04.001 --> 09:06.546
...to pair you with Vasquez
to help solve this latest Calling.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.298
Sorry, why... why me?
What happened to Drea or Wicks?

09:09.298 --> 09:12.885
They've already been dispatched,
and they aren't passengers.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.806
Okay, what about Ben? We could both--

09:16.806 --> 09:18.641
Ben will be released from solitary,

09:18.641 --> 09:22.395
but you are the only passenger
with a law enforcement background.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.274
So you're just gonna
let me walk out the door--

09:30.069 --> 09:30.987
[scoffs]

09:31.779 --> 09:33.322
You chipped me, didn't you?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.617
- That's barbaric. You can't.
- [Jared] Seriously?

09:36.617 --> 09:37.868
An insurance policy.

09:37.868 --> 09:41.289
If you aren't back in this room
by 5:00 p.m., Calling solved or not,

09:41.289 --> 09:43.666
you'll never see
the other side of that wall again.

09:46.919 --> 09:47.920
Fine.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.177
I cannot tell you
how long I've been fighting

09:55.177 --> 09:57.138
to get a passenger on the Callings Unit,

09:57.138 --> 10:00.224
and we need a win, so do not let me down.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.106

10:07.106 --> 10:11.068
Dim lights, violins, spilled ink,
and a jumble of numbers.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.696
Okay, well, we've done more with less.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.156
It was a city work order, right?

10:15.156 --> 10:18.034
We know that, which means
I may have a possible shortcut.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.538
- All right. Time's up.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.247
Hmm.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.254
I don't know how much longer
I can hide it. Just...

11:13.589 --> 11:15.549
- Just not yet.
- No, I get it.

11:16.884 --> 11:18.552
It's not normal in here.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.848
But, um, hey, we've been able
to hide it this long.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.269
What's the Registry gonna do with me
when they find out that I'm pregnant?

11:27.269 --> 11:30.564
Or worse, what are they gonna do
with my baby?

11:30.564 --> 11:32.400
No, I understand you're scared.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.945
And I don't have all the answers for you,
but I can promise you one thing.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.988
You're not gonna have to go at it alone.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.449
And I am not gonna tell anybody
till you're ready.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.119
Excuse me. I'm with a patient!

11:43.119 --> 11:44.453
Come with me now. It's Ben.

11:45.788 --> 11:49.250
Okay. Just stay in here
as long as you need. Okay?

11:49.250 --> 11:52.545
I tried to pull him out of it,
but it's like he's in a trance.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.464
I've never seen a Calling
like this before.

11:55.464 --> 11:59.343
It says, "Wake him up." Is there anything
you can give him to snap him out of it?

11:59.343 --> 12:02.972
I don't think we're supposed to stop him.
I think he's supposed to finish this.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.849
You think he'll finish in two minutes?

12:04.849 --> 12:06.767
I need to monitor the Callings Unit.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.936
Zimmer's up my ass,
watching their every move.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.896
Clearly, this is
Callings Unit business too.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.733
I'm gonna keep an eye on him.
Make sure he's okay once he's done.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.152
I'm leaving you alone in a restricted area

12:16.152 --> 12:19.196
and trusting you to get him to his room.
Don't make me regret this.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.616
I've got a lot on the line today.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.916
- Mickey Mouse, so good to see you.
- You too.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.918
It's been... I don't even know how long.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.796
I tried to invite you
to the Vasquez Thanksgiving, but Jared--

12:35.796 --> 12:37.673
Okay, yeah, nope. Mmm-mm.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.301
Wait a minute.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.013
- Are you two...
- Come on, bro. <i>No empieces.</i>

12:44.013 --> 12:46.932
- The holidays have never been the same.
- Aw.

12:46.932 --> 12:50.019
All right, all right. So, what's up?

12:50.019 --> 12:52.438
First off, you look funny
behind this big desk, little bro.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.106
Your face will look funny if you keep on.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.524
- [Jared] Oh, yeah?
- [brother] Yeah.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.359
- [laughing]
- Ooh.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.155
So you come all the way to the Bronx
to mock my spot or what?

13:01.155 --> 13:03.532
We were hoping you could help us
locate a business,

13:03.532 --> 13:05.951
<i>pero</i> there's a bit of a catch.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.162
We only have a few numbers
for you to go by.

13:08.162 --> 13:11.540
So we're hoping this database of yours
got Google beat on this one.

13:11.540 --> 13:12.708
Uh, leave it to me.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.341
Thanks to Uncle Jared,
my kids practically live on that thing.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.135
He built it in a week. Overachiever.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.221
Huh. A man of many talents.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.556
His brother has a few talents as well.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.767
And...

13:31.143 --> 13:32.228
voilà.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.439
So these are the plat numbers.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.191
They identify the city blocks,

13:37.191 --> 13:39.860
but within that block,
there are 15 businesses.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.905
So without more numbers to go on,
I can't narrow it down further.

13:42.905 --> 13:47.409
Fifteen. Okay, we should bounce.
Time is not on our side. Thank you though.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.411
- So good to see you.
- You too.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.747
Hey. Take care.

13:52.581 --> 13:56.752
And then last night, Hannah's brain scan
showed that her Calling finally stopped.

13:56.752 --> 13:57.962
And I just...

13:58.838 --> 14:03.133
I worry it's another Calling
that went away because it wasn't solved.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.761
Who knows what that means

14:07.054 --> 14:08.097
for our Lifeboat.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.894
Oh, I guess I can finally tell you
since you can't actually hear me,

14:13.894 --> 14:17.731
but Polly, Ben, she's pregnant.

14:21.443 --> 14:24.488
Life in here is so cruel and hard, and...

14:27.283 --> 14:29.410
I'm really glad that you came back.

14:29.952 --> 14:30.995
[gasps]

14:30.995 --> 14:34.832
- Ben? Hey. Ben? Hey, come here.
- [Ben groans]

14:34.832 --> 14:35.833
Hey, you okay?

14:38.294 --> 14:39.712
- Saanvi.
- Yeah.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.136
What the hell is that?

14:47.136 --> 14:49.513
[mysterious music plays]

14:53.142 --> 14:54.602
[indistinct chatter]

14:55.477 --> 14:58.856
All right. So, um, so far,
we have zero leads.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.150
And that was, what? Stop number nine?

15:01.775 --> 15:06.196
Only half of them recognize me as,
I quote, an "828 freak," so that's good.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.324
On the bright side,
we're running out of time.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.658
This is bullshit.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.328
I mean, what if the only reason
Joe got the Calling

15:12.328 --> 15:14.747
was because he's a contractor?

15:14.747 --> 15:18.083
He'd have an easier time helping us know
what to look for in these shops

15:18.083 --> 15:19.627
if he was here with us.

15:19.627 --> 15:23.422
I don't understand how Zimmer thinks
I can solve someone else's Calling.

15:23.422 --> 15:27.927
I've seen you do it a thousand times.
Seriously, you're like a Calling legend.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.933
You see? You see? There she is.
What are you... What now?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.393
No, it looks... The street looks familiar.

15:36.977 --> 15:40.856
A couple blocks that way.
Isn't there the Around the World bar?

15:40.856 --> 15:43.108
We'd go there after beat shifts
back in the day.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.779
Shit, yes, that's right. With
a drink-your-way-around-the-world menu.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.698
All the beers from different countries.
Oh my gosh. That Lithuanian lager.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.659
[Jared] Ooh. That hit the spot every time.

15:52.534 --> 15:57.665
You know, actually, I, uh... I may have
looked up honeymoons in Lithuania.

15:59.875 --> 16:00.709
Yeah.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.588
Hey, if we solve Joe's Calling, maybe
we can go by the bar, see if it's open.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.673
I give it 20 minutes

16:05.673 --> 16:08.217
before Zimmer's red-headed henchman
hunts us down.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.802
Well, we'd only need ten.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.516
Preventing the world from ending
and finding Joe's son

16:15.516 --> 16:17.726
were my primary goals
in solving Joe's Calling,

16:17.726 --> 16:20.521
but Lithuanian beer ain't bad either.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.692
"Wake him up. Wake him up."
Wake who up? You?

16:24.692 --> 16:25.943
I have no idea.

16:26.735 --> 16:30.072
Clearly, I thought it was important.
What's with my spacing?

16:31.657 --> 16:32.783
The spaces are...

16:35.035 --> 16:36.036
a path.

16:37.746 --> 16:38.747
Leading us to...

16:41.875 --> 16:42.960
this.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.045
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.798

16:48.966 --> 16:49.967

16:55.597 --> 16:59.309
Labs. Ben, this is a map
of the detention center.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.272
We're not waiting for Callings Unit
to handle this, are we?

17:03.272 --> 17:04.732
No, we are not.

17:04.732 --> 17:08.902
As my kids like to say,
we're going on a treasure hunt.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.988
[suspenseful music plays]

17:15.034 --> 17:17.995
- [Jared] Next door?
- I hope this is the right place.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.667
[doorbell buzzes]

17:23.667 --> 17:25.794
[violins playing]

17:25.794 --> 17:28.088
Violins. That's a promising start.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.467
I've been waiting for you.

17:31.467 --> 17:36.472
I think I know
exactly what you're looking for.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.265
- [Jared] Oh, uh... Yeah.
- No!

17:38.265 --> 17:40.684
No, I'm sorry, sir.
We're not ring shopping.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.770
Gold, round cut,

17:42.770 --> 17:44.897
pretty simple, very tasteful.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.398
[Jared] It's... It's nice.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.234
Actually, I...
I gave her one just like that.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.362
Yeah. Problem is she gave it back.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.073
- Oh.
- Yeah.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.115
[chuckles] Oh dear.

17:55.115 --> 17:59.244
And what he's leaving out is
he chose a princess cut.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.913
- Uh, did I get that right?
- Mm-hmm.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.999
Yeah. It just so happened to be
on my best friend's finger instead.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.959
- You really wanna play this game?
- I do.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.961
- Yeah.
- [shopkeeper] Ah.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.463
Not here for rings.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.215
Got it.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.092
Well, I'm Graham Carpenter.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.595
So, uh... [sighs] What can I do you for?

18:16.595 --> 18:18.722
Well, we received reports
of potential code issues.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.849
We're just checking out the whole block.

18:20.849 --> 18:24.144
Well, the store's gas main
was updated last month.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.980
The electrical system
is in good working order.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.150
As far as I'm aware, no water issues.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.403
But you're welcome
to look around for yourselves.

18:33.904 --> 18:34.780
Thanks.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.411
[mysterious music plays]

18:51.547 --> 18:52.673
There's a camera down there.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.634
When it turns again, we have eight seconds
to get to the end of the hall.

18:55.634 --> 18:56.927
Wait, how do you know--

18:56.927 --> 18:59.555
While you spent the last few months
trying to find a way out,

18:59.555 --> 19:01.348
I've been finding my way around.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.102
Go in order by room.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.689
[camera whirs]

19:09.481 --> 19:10.399
Okay, let's go.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.860
[suspenseful music plays]

19:28.750 --> 19:31.795
- [man over radio] <i>Heading your way now.</i>
- Yeah. Okay, copy that.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.338
[Saanvi] Someone's coming.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.256
Wait! Wait.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.257
In here.

19:40.637 --> 19:41.680
Sh.

19:42.806 --> 19:43.765
[door opens]

19:43.765 --> 19:46.518
If they find us in here,
we'll never see the light of day.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.312
There's no reason passengers
should be here.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.439
- Okay, so just follow my lead.
- [keys jingle]

19:54.109 --> 19:55.152
Hey, you mind?

19:55.652 --> 19:56.862
[Vance] Yeah, kind of.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.739
- [Saanvi sighs]
- Vance, thank God.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.782
I come down here to make sure
you two are okay,

20:00.782 --> 20:03.118
and you're playing tonsil hockey
like it's prom night?

20:03.118 --> 20:06.580
- We thought you were Zimmer's attack dogs.
- Whatever it is you're doing, wrap it up.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.916
There's a surprise count happening later.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.877
If you aren't in your rooms by then,
you'll both be locked up indefinitely.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.421
Vance, the faster you distract
the guard down the hall,

20:14.421 --> 20:17.257
the faster we solve this thing
and make it back to our bunks.

20:22.262 --> 20:25.307
Hey, I think the scanner down here
is broken. Can you confirm?

20:25.307 --> 20:26.225
[guard] Yes, sir.

20:35.567 --> 20:39.696
[man over P.A.]
<i>All guards. Lockdown by 7:00 p.m. tonight.</i>

20:39.696 --> 20:41.782
[violin music playing]

20:43.367 --> 20:44.201
So...

20:46.328 --> 20:48.538
the lights in here, they don't ever dim?

20:49.039 --> 20:51.208
Again, no.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.294
You checked the electrical,
the gas, the water,

20:54.294 --> 20:56.338
even the printer ink supply,

20:56.338 --> 20:59.633
which I highly doubt
falls under the city code.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.469
Thank you for your patience.

21:11.561 --> 21:12.396
[door buzzes]

21:15.774 --> 21:17.693
All right, so do you think
we got the wrong store?

21:17.693 --> 21:21.154
No, that has to be the right one.
It's the only one playing classical music.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.323
Not to mention he nailed your ring style.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.493
Or what I thought was your ring style.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.039
It was perfect.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.544
What did you, uh, do with it, anyways?

21:35.544 --> 21:37.629
[sentimental music plays]

21:38.630 --> 21:39.631
Your ring?

21:42.801 --> 21:43.802
I still have it.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.892
If you think this is the right store,
we should call Olive, right?

21:50.892 --> 21:53.061
Have her, you know,
cross-reference the boards.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.897
Look at you, Mr. Callings Unit. Go ahead.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.278
[phone buzzing]

22:05.574 --> 22:06.658
- Jared?
- [Jared] <i>Hey.</i>

22:07.326 --> 22:09.161
I just tried Olive,
but she didn't pick up.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.788
Dad smashed her phone. Classic.

22:11.788 --> 22:14.207
Well, I got a familiar voice for you.
Hold on.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.752
Hey, it's me.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.420
Hey, you got out again?

22:18.420 --> 22:21.590
Uh, not exactly. Um...

22:22.549 --> 22:23.425
Long story.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.762
I need you to find any info
on Joe Butler. 29 C.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.805
All right. Let's see.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.480
Originally from South Carolina.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.647
Has a kid.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.025
He lost his wife a few years ago.

22:40.025 --> 22:43.528
- They haven't had it easy.
- Don't forget about the ink or the lights.

22:43.528 --> 22:49.659
Hey, is there anything on the boards
about, um, ink or tar or ooze?

22:50.160 --> 22:53.789
<i>Or any mythology on dim lights? Uh...</i>

22:54.373 --> 22:57.042
Contractors? Form?

22:57.042 --> 22:59.336
God, the more I talk,
the more it's a lost cause.

22:59.336 --> 23:02.255
Yeah. Sorry, I'm not seeing anything
on the boards.

23:02.255 --> 23:05.425
- Did your Calling have anything else?
- [Michaela] <i>Not my Calling. It's Joe's.</i>

23:05.425 --> 23:08.470
He's desperate for us to solve it
so that he can track down his kid.

23:08.470 --> 23:09.679
Oh.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.015
[Michaela]
<i>I wish there was a way to get in his head.</i>

23:15.852 --> 23:17.396
[screams]

23:18.480 --> 23:22.359
Aunt Mick, remember what I said about
seeing Bethany's Calling the other day?

23:22.359 --> 23:24.778
<i>- Yeah.
-</i> What if I could do that again?

23:26.363 --> 23:29.825
Intentionally getting inside
someone else's Calling? Can you do that?

23:29.825 --> 23:33.245
I have no idea, but I can try.

[door opens]

24:48.361 --> 24:49.654
[Vance] See anything new?

24:50.822 --> 24:54.659
I had the sensation of a Calling,
but it was totally blank.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.453
Well, that's new.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.080
His brain activity indicates
he had a Calling.

24:59.706 --> 25:02.334
Print out his scans for me, will you?
I'll take it up with Dr. Bahl.

- [Cal] <i>Hey, you still with me?
-</i> Yeah.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.674
I did it. I was in Joe's Calling.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.302
Cal, that's incredible. How?

25:12.302 --> 25:14.804
I can't explain it exactly,
but listen, this felt urgent.

25:14.804 --> 25:19.768
I saw the ink and the piece of paper
and the dim light, but it didn't stay dim.

25:19.768 --> 25:20.769
What do you mean?

25:20.769 --> 25:23.438
It was an old chandelier
over the front desk.

25:23.438 --> 25:26.066
The bulbs burned so brightly,
they shattered.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.902
Okay, we're on it. Thank you.
You're amazing. Go, Dragons!

25:28.902 --> 25:33.573
And after losing another five years
of my life over guards and near misses...

25:33.573 --> 25:34.741
This would be the X.

25:34.741 --> 25:37.327
- [door buzzes]
- We're gonna have to handle one more.

How do we get in? A four-digit lock
leaves us with 9,999 combination options.

- Really, 10,000.
- [keypad beeps]

- Calling?
- No, I just brought my ears.

I punch a code into my lab every day.
I've gotten used to the tones.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.610
I'd say I'd kiss you,
but been there, done that.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.031
Oh my God.

26:15.031 --> 26:17.117

26:32.048 --> 26:33.049
[door buzzes]

26:33.717 --> 26:35.427
Oh great. You're back.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.178
Was there a chandelier there?

26:37.178 --> 26:39.806
Well, if there was,
it would've been over a century ago.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.058
The whole system is defunct.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.772
Come on. The city shut that system down
in the 1930s.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.275
There's no way it could generate
a spark of any kind.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.610
No, he's right.

26:51.610 --> 26:56.156
Listen, kids, I've been playing ball
with you for hours, but I'm done.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.532
Time to call it a day.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.785
There's no way this system's capable
of lighting anything.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.162
The Callings aren't literal.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.331
We're supposed to pay attention
to the electrical unit,

27:05.206 --> 27:07.876
which means, Mr. I've-Been
on-the-Callings-Unit-for-Eight-Months,

27:07.876 --> 27:09.210
that we...

27:09.210 --> 27:10.295
Follow the wires.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.380
I'll take the downstairs.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.093
What? You've gotta be kidding me.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.638
There is nothing down there.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.723
Bill, are you okay?

27:23.558 --> 27:27.228
- What happened to him? How'd he get here?
- [Saanvi] I don't know. Uh...

27:27.228 --> 27:29.856
Okay, we know
that after Cal touched the tail fin,

27:29.856 --> 27:31.608
he saw Daly in the glow.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.526
And Daly wanted Cal to stay there.

27:33.526 --> 27:36.071
Then he blipped back into the plane
at Eureka for a few seconds.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.531
And then he disappeared again.
I assume back into the glow.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.077
That leads us back
to our original question.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.370
How'd he get here?

27:43.370 --> 27:45.413
I mean, his vitals are completely normal.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.166
So, what?
He's comatose like the detainees?

27:48.166 --> 27:50.168
No. No, not according to his charts.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.336
I mean, he has been sedated

27:51.336 --> 27:54.297
to make it easier
to monitor his brain activity and vitals.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.465
- Saanvi.
- What?

27:55.965 --> 27:56.966
My Calling.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.344
"Wake him up." We have to wake him up.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.554
He could have information
about the glow. Bill!

28:01.554 --> 28:04.099
He doesn't have the vapors.
They've pumped him full of Ketofol.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.183
Gotta get him to talk.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.977
Someone could come in any second now.
Bill, can you hear me?

28:07.977 --> 28:10.146
Did I ever tell you
what my favorite movie was?

28:11.439 --> 28:14.067
Uh, <i>Shawshank Redemption? Arrival?</i>

28:14.067 --> 28:15.610
No, <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

28:15.610 --> 28:17.195

29:06.786 --> 29:09.664
Wow, it's nice to see a familiar face. Hi.

29:10.373 --> 29:12.500
Angelina, you're alive?

29:13.877 --> 29:15.378
Did I bring you here?

29:15.378 --> 29:19.382
We always seem to find a way
to each other. We're connected, Cal.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.803
No, I don't wanna be anywhere near you.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.931
[panting]

29:42.530 --> 29:44.699
- [gasping]
- [Ben] Bill? Bill. Bill.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.826
Can you see me? Can you see me?

29:47.535 --> 29:49.037
[sighs] Thank God.

29:49.037 --> 29:51.915
Okay. You're gonna be okay, all right?

29:52.415 --> 29:55.835
Now, can you remember anything
about the glow or how you got here

29:55.835 --> 29:56.961
or when you got here?

29:56.961 --> 29:58.505
[machine beeping]

29:58.505 --> 30:01.716
Okay, he's trying to say something.
It's okay. Hey, take your time.

30:01.716 --> 30:02.717
- [buzzer sounds]
- Shit.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.470
[man] <i>All passengers must scan
and return to sleeping quarters...</i>

30:05.470 --> 30:07.514
This is what Vance was trying
to warn us about.

30:07.514 --> 30:08.973
- I can't leave him here.
- No, no.

30:08.973 --> 30:12.435
If they catch us, they're gonna lock us up
in solitary for God knows how long.

30:12.435 --> 30:15.855
- And then we're no use to Daly or anybody.
- Calling. We have to wake him up.

30:15.855 --> 30:18.733
We did that already. And to be able
to do more, we have to leave.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.109
- [Ben] Right.
- Ben. Now.

30:20.109 --> 30:22.695
We'll be back for you, okay?
I promise you.

30:22.695 --> 30:24.656
- [Saanvi] Ben. Let's go.
- I promise you.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.328
Look, I do not give you permission
to be back here,

30:30.328 --> 30:32.539
so let's just wrap this little charade up.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.875
- Has this always been a wall?
- Did you hear me?

30:35.875 --> 30:37.877
You're gonna have to come back
with a warrant!

30:37.877 --> 30:38.795
[faint music plays]

30:38.795 --> 30:40.964
I bet a contractor
would deem this a fake wall.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.053
Mick, watch out.

30:51.391 --> 30:52.350
Get up!

31:11.536 --> 31:13.663
Oh my God, this is his trafficking ring.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.753
Is everyone okay?
Okay, you guys are safe now, all right?

31:22.088 --> 31:24.716
- Daddy!
- Charlie?

31:27.635 --> 31:29.929
I think Joe's Calling just saved his son.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.066
[police siren blares]

31:44.277 --> 31:46.654
He created whole new identities for them.

31:46.654 --> 31:49.324
Forged adoption papers.
Faked birth certificates.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.742
You caught this just in time.

31:50.742 --> 31:51.784
Yeah, I know.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.579
These kids thought
they were going to camp.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.372
They had no idea what was gonna happen.

31:56.372 --> 31:58.458
We've been after this ring
for almost a year.

31:58.458 --> 32:02.295
Now it's busted wide open.
Good job. We'll take it from here.

32:02.295 --> 32:05.632
Listen. DCS, they had him placed
with a family. You don't understand that?

32:05.632 --> 32:07.425
[woman] We've had him
with several families.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.761
Once they find out
his father was on Flight--

32:11.220 --> 32:14.807
I promise I will personally do my best
to get him into the right home.

32:14.807 --> 32:18.311
Can I go live with my dad?
He's the right home for me.

32:21.731 --> 32:24.567
Hey, your dad, he loves you so much.

32:24.567 --> 32:27.570
I know that 'cause he's got
a picture of you beside his heart.

32:27.570 --> 32:28.821
He does?

32:29.405 --> 32:31.908
Hey, you know what your dad told me?

32:32.533 --> 32:37.455
He said you help him every single time
he gets scared of the dark. You help him.

32:37.455 --> 32:42.001
Yeah, I say, "It's okay, Daddy.
We're all scared of the dark sometimes."

32:42.001 --> 32:43.294
And he feels better.

32:49.425 --> 32:52.387
We'll make sure he's placed with a family
sympathetic toward 828.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.721
Oh, I'm gonna make sure of that.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.726
Hey, you're gonna be okay.
All right, Charlie? I promise you.

33:00.186 --> 33:02.397
Come here. Come here, buddy.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.126
- All right.
- Thank you.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.043
You all right?

33:24.043 --> 33:26.045
I'm pregnant. I get lightheaded sometimes.

33:26.045 --> 33:28.840
- Are you hurt? Did you hit--
- [Polly] No, I'm okay.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.133
Thank you.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.592

33:39.100 --> 33:41.060
[Joe] You guys just missed the crackdown,

33:41.561 --> 33:44.188
but I hope you had
a good time out in the world today.

33:44.731 --> 33:45.898
[Michaela] We did.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.985
We, um... We solved your Calling.

33:49.777 --> 33:51.988
Does that mean you'll call about my son?

33:51.988 --> 33:53.740
They'll do you one better.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.576
Come with us. We'll tell you everything
you need to know.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.128
He was a little rattled,

34:07.128 --> 34:09.505
but he has no idea
how much danger he was in.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.424
Your Calling saved his life.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.097
[Joe] Charlie.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.516
Charlie. Oh my God. My boy.

34:21.768 --> 34:22.602
I missed you.

34:22.602 --> 34:26.355
I missed you too, Daddy.
Look, I have a wiggly tooth.

34:28.066 --> 34:31.944
And guess what?
I get to see you all the time now.

34:31.944 --> 34:37.075
My new foster family said
they'd bring me for visits anytime,

34:37.075 --> 34:39.285
just until I get to live with you again.

34:39.285 --> 34:40.870
They have this monster playset.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.414
And Caleb, he was fostered too.

34:43.414 --> 34:46.334
He says he has
an extra night-light for me.

34:46.959 --> 34:50.129
He gets scared of the dark sometimes,
just like me and you.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.384
Buddy, today is a reminder.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.012
The dark never lasts.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.292
You had a hell of a day.

35:31.129 --> 35:35.716
Yeah, I got to be a detective again.
I got to actually help make a difference.

35:35.716 --> 35:36.759
Yeah, you did.

35:36.759 --> 35:37.802
[chuckles]

35:38.636 --> 35:39.762
Zeke, it felt good.

35:39.762 --> 35:43.850
It just felt good
being back out there doing that.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.980

I got locked right back up here.

the bad ones have on you.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.699
Focus on the impact
you have on the good ones.

36:00.783 --> 36:02.118
That's why I love you.

36:03.119 --> 36:05.079
You always know exactly what to say.

36:05.663 --> 36:06.581
Hmm.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.047
But sometimes words aren't enough.

36:16.215 --> 36:18.217
I could really use a hug right now.

36:19.802 --> 36:21.470
I'd give you one if I could.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.435

everything's gonna be okay?

[Jared] I didn't get a chance
to thank you for today.

36:54.754 --> 36:58.841
I don't know. Working together like that,
it just, uh, felt like old times.

[laughs softly]

37:01.344 --> 37:03.137

a little something from the past.

- [Michaela] Uh...
- Yeah, it's not the ring.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.142
- Mmm-mm.
- Okay. That's good.

37:08.142 --> 37:09.310

Hey!

37:31.207 --> 37:33.251
I saw your light on. You good?

37:33.251 --> 37:35.711
I am. In fact, I saw him today.

37:35.711 --> 37:38.214
- Who?
- The other chosen one.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.132
Was he happy to see you?

37:42.718 --> 37:44.428
Not really. Um...

37:44.428 --> 37:45.930
He doesn't understand.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.683
But he will.

He will.

- Glad we're on the same side.

We made a pretty good team today.

Daly brought back with him?

40:29.593 --> 40:30.636
No idea.

40:32.138 --> 40:35.599
But if we've learned anything, it's that
we know no one returns empty-handed.

Hmm.

- I thought you were gonna take it easy.
- [Saanvi] I can't.
