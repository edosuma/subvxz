WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:03.628
- Oh, my phone!

00:03.711 --> 00:05.213
Oh, I've missed you.
Did you miss me?

00:05.296 --> 00:08.425
Who do I love more than
anyone else in the world?

00:08.508 --> 00:11.928
- Hello, boyfriend
in the doorway.

00:12.011 --> 00:14.389
- Stepmom on the couch.

00:14.472 --> 00:17.392
Who am I kidding?
I'm not even in the top three.

00:17.475 --> 00:19.269
- Hey, Steph, my history
teacher is making us

00:19.352 --> 00:21.187
live like Medieval
peasants all day.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.690
No technology,
no modern conveniences.

00:23.773 --> 00:24.733
Can you sign
this form saying

00:24.816 --> 00:28.069
that I haven't used any
electronics at home?

00:28.153 --> 00:29.320
- You're on your phone
right now.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.031
- Just shooting you
a reminder text.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.616
- I knew you couldn't do it.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.784
- What does that mean?

00:34.868 --> 00:37.370
- It means you're the girl
who comes home from school,

00:37.454 --> 00:38.663
does a wardrobe change,

00:38.747 --> 00:40.665
then watches three episodes
of Beverly Hills Hair.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.792
Then you text Molly
about Beverly Hills Hair,

00:42.876 --> 00:44.461
until it's time to Skype
with Molly

00:44.544 --> 00:46.504
about Beverly Hills Hair.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.423
- Why are you coming
after Beverly Hills Hair?

00:48.506 --> 00:50.133
It's people trying to
get along in a hair shop--

00:50.216 --> 00:52.594
which is not easy.

00:52.677 --> 00:55.138
- I'm just saying Gabby
likes her stuff.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.599
- What? I'm materialistic?

00:57.682 --> 00:59.309
- I'm sorry, were you
saying something?

00:59.392 --> 01:03.271
I was distracted by all those
bracelets you're wearing.

01:03.354 --> 01:06.107
- I am so not materialistic
and I'll prove it.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.277
I'll go without modern
anything all night--

01:09.360 --> 01:10.445
all week, in fact.

01:10.528 --> 01:11.821
- Oh, yeah, I'd like
to see that.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.156
- Well, you're about
to see that.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.785
You're about to watch me go
Medieval on your butt.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.745
- Ooh, good for you, Gabby.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.914
In fact, let's go buy you
some new leather boots

01:20.997 --> 01:22.165
to get you into character.

01:22.248 --> 01:25.502
- Nay, good woman.
I am but a peasant.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.797
I fashion my simple footwear
out of skins and rags.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.799
But when this is over,
I shall accept those boots

01:30.882 --> 01:35.970
and that motorcycle jacket of
which I have been emailing you.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.640
- Stephanie, got a minute?
We need to have a little talk.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.183
- Sure.
- Great.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.684
I wanna make this
easy for you,

01:41.768 --> 01:42.852
so I wrote down your part,

01:42.936 --> 01:45.313
and Aaron's gonna
do it, instead.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.482
- Yes, holding up my end
of a conversation

01:47.565 --> 01:50.318
is pretty exhausting,
so thank you, Aaron.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.862
- No problem.
I got your back.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.823
- Stephanie and/or Dad,

01:54.906 --> 01:57.951
this weekend is the Wizardcraft
Pro Tournament semi-finals.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.244
- Wizardcraft Pro Tournament?

01:59.327 --> 02:01.996
I never heard of
such a thing.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.207
- It's the championship
of my favorite video game

02:04.290 --> 02:07.335
and my favorite pro team.
The class is in the semi-finals.

02:07.418 --> 02:08.961
- Pro video game team?

02:09.044 --> 02:13.424
I'm an adult. I don't understand
what that is.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.469
- Allow me to explain--
Professional video gamers.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.762
The best players
in the world

02:17.846 --> 02:19.889
will be competing in
a tournament here this weekend.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.851
- Right here in Philadelphia?
What are the odds?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.858
- I know.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.068
And since pro gaming is what
I plan to do for a living,

02:32.151 --> 02:33.570
I wanna go see it.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.071
Think of it as
a career day.

02:35.155 --> 02:38.116
All I need is a parent and/or
stepparent to take me there.

02:38.199 --> 02:42.120
- Well, aren't the tickets
very...expressive?

02:42.203 --> 02:44.497
- Expensive.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.000
But, no, I'll pay
for it with money

02:47.083 --> 02:48.668
I have saved up
from doing chores.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.378
- Chores?
- Scams.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.547
- Thank you.

02:52.630 --> 02:56.885
- Gosh, I think you have
answered all my questions.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.469
- All right, James,
I'll take you.

02:58.553 --> 03:02.056
- What do you mean no?
Why do you hate me?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.808
- Dude, she said yes.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.397
- Ah, here it is.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.274
Thank you, you are
a wonderful father

03:11.357 --> 03:14.193
and/or addition
to the family.

{\an8}- Do we care that this child is
eating weeds with her hands?

03:44.432 --> 03:45.975
{\an8}- We do not.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.352
{\an8}She's trying to prove
a point to Noah.

03:47.435 --> 03:51.898
{\an8}We've had two days of
foraging and not showering.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.483
{\an8}- I am but a simple
Medieval peasant

03:53.566 --> 03:57.737
{\an8}And I am afraid of
your magic rain machine.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.489
{\an8}- Hey, Dad.
Hey, Grandma Maggie.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.492
{\an8}Hey, peasant Gabby.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.327
{\an8}- What ails you, boy?

04:04.410 --> 04:07.705
{\an8}- Do you know how mighty
LeBron James is at kickball?

04:07.789 --> 04:10.541
{\an8}- It never came up,
but continue.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.502
{\an8}- There's this new giant
kid in my class

04:12.585 --> 04:14.504
{\an8}named Darren Mochler.

04:14.587 --> 04:19.676
{\an8}He just transferred
from I'm guessing the Army.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.095
Now everyone wants him
to be on their team.

04:22.178 --> 04:25.890
- Oh, maybe you can be
the LeBron James of dodge ball?

04:25.974 --> 04:29.894
- Nope, Darren Mochler can knock
out six kids with one shot.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.896
They changed the name
of the game

04:31.980 --> 04:35.400
from dodge ball to
run-here-comes-Darren-Mochler!

04:35.483 --> 04:37.527
He is the best
at everything.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.071
- He is not the world's
best grandson.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.364
- Yes, he is.

04:41.447 --> 04:44.742
He even has a t-shirt
that says so.

04:44.826 --> 04:49.205
Oh, I need a popsicle.

04:49.288 --> 04:51.416
- Hey, guys, we're back.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.750
- Best day ever.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.377
- How wast thy tournament?

04:54.460 --> 04:56.462
- Oh, that's still
going on?

04:56.546 --> 04:59.424
- And on-eth and on-eth
and on-eth.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.426
- You should have been there,
Dad. I got discovered.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.386
They want me to be a
professional video game player.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.179
- I thought you were
there just to watch.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.973
- You know how
at basketball games

05:07.056 --> 05:09.058
they bring down fans
for shooting contests?

05:09.142 --> 05:12.520
James got called down
to play Wizardcraft.

05:12.603 --> 05:15.273
He was incredible.
Everybody was cheering.

05:15.356 --> 05:18.234
- So I got like a 30 light base
and then I used a water storm.

05:18.317 --> 05:19.569
They did a spill/roll attack,

05:19.652 --> 05:23.781
so I freezed them up
with like a freezing spell.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.908
And I got this.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.077
- Oh, Zackary Fumegant,
Manager.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.039
- He runs my favorite
team, The Clash.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.666
- He wants to talk to us
about James going pro.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.918
- Oh, ho!

05:36.002 --> 05:37.628
No!

05:37.712 --> 05:40.923
- Charlie, this guy
thinks James has real talent.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.509
- Real talent
at a fake thing.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.094
Being a professional
video game player

05:45.178 --> 05:47.138
is like being a professional--
- Football player,

05:47.221 --> 05:48.431
baseball, tennis.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.767
Stop me when I over
prove my point.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.477
- This is just
a bunch of kids

05:52.560 --> 05:54.479
trying to justify
playing video games all day.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.314
- No, I was there.
It's legit.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.816
There were teams,
and commentators,

05:58.900 --> 06:01.027
and sponsors--
it was amazing.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.446
- This must be generational.
- You must be generational.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.115
I wanna play video games.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.993
- Charlie, video games
might not be our thing,

06:09.077 --> 06:10.453
but they are James' thing.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.915
And our thing should be
supporting his thing.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.375
- Can somebody please
reason with

06:16.459 --> 06:19.837
that peasant child
in there.

06:19.921 --> 06:23.216
She's talking about stoning
me for wearing pants.

06:26.928 --> 06:30.056
- James!
There's my golden ticket.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.642
Dr. and Mrs. Phillips,
it is great to meet you.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.851
- Hi.
- I'm Zack Fumegant.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.979
- Uh, you're the manager?
- Be cool, Dad.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.648
- It's okay.
I've heard it all before.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.149
Hey, kid, whose
office is this?

06:40.233 --> 06:43.861
Hey, kid, how can you
afford a $24,000 watch?

06:43.945 --> 06:46.322
- This is all very hip
and snazzy,

06:46.405 --> 06:49.158
but, uh, what exactly
do you do here?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.327
- My Dad doesn't think
pro gaming is real.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.330
- Ha, ha. So you must be
the cool parent.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.166
- Guilty.
[laughing]

06:57.250 --> 07:00.419
But we do have
some concerns.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.421
- Which part concerns
you more--

07:02.505 --> 07:04.340
the all-expense-paid
global travel

07:04.423 --> 07:07.552
or the earnings that he's gonna
put into his college fund?

07:07.635 --> 07:09.846
- See, Dad, college.
That wasn't even on my radar,

07:09.929 --> 07:13.391
but now it's
a definite maybe.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.852
- How will this affect
his daily routine?

07:15.935 --> 07:18.396
- He'll go to school.
He'll practice a bit.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.773
Go play in a few tournaments.
Endorse a few products.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.734
But, for the most part,
he's just gonna be a normal kid.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.195
- Please, Dad?

07:26.279 --> 07:27.697
- [inhales]

07:27.780 --> 07:29.866
Well, this seems
kinda real.

07:29.949 --> 07:34.412
- Remember, our thing
is supporting their thing.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.872
- Sure.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.206
We can give it a shot.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.708
- I can do it?

07:38.791 --> 07:40.710
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

07:40.793 --> 07:44.380
- Great, I will email
a contract to your lawyer,

07:44.463 --> 07:46.215
and when you're ready
to sign it,

07:46.299 --> 07:48.050
you just scroll down
to the bottom and click accept.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.928
- I can sign a whole contract
with just one click?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.221
- Mm-hm.
- I feel so old fashioned.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.558
- That makes you feel
old fashioned?

07:55.641 --> 07:58.603
You have a flip phone.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.229
- Do you really wanna
go there right now?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.273
- I do not.
- Mm-hm.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.236
- James, do you know
the capital of Arkansas?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.738
- Nope, but I do know
the capital of

08:08.821 --> 08:11.240
I've-got-the-best-job-
on-the-planet.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.744
It's right here
on this sofa.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.455
- I wish I was
on the sofa.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.582
- This is a whole new
world for me, Aaron.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.500
Today at school, two girls
who usually walk by me

08:21.584 --> 08:25.630
and giggle--did not giggle.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.089
- What?

08:27.173 --> 08:29.133
- Hand me some of that
veggie jerky I'm endorsing.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.593
- I thought you
hated that stuff.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.095
- Yeah, but Veg Out
is a major sponsor.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.472
Zack says I have to
learn to like it.

08:38.392 --> 08:41.102
Once you get fight
the gag reflex,

08:41.187 --> 08:43.606
it goes down
pretty smooth.

08:43.688 --> 08:44.565
- You know who has
no gag reflex?

08:44.649 --> 08:47.944
That new kid in my class
Darren Mochler.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.988
He can eat a whole sandwich
without chewing.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.574
Peanut butter!

08:53.658 --> 08:57.370
- All I'm saying is I waited at
the library for an hour.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.454
You could have just texted me,
if you were gonna be late.

08:58.538 --> 09:02.959
- I sent forth an owl.
Did it not find you?

09:03.042 --> 09:05.461
- All right, I think you're
going a little overboard here.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.630
Can Gabby teleport
back to the present?

09:07.713 --> 09:09.966
- What is this time
travel you speak of?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.550
Have you come down
with the Black Death?

09:11.634 --> 09:14.178
Your mind is
all a-fevered.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.348
- If you weren't so cute,
I'd break up with you right now.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.475
- All right, Charlie, I have
a meeting with a client.

09:19.558 --> 09:20.977
I'll be back for dinner.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.020
- But you have to take me
to my sponsor event.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.314
- That's today?
Charlie, can you take him?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.191
- Nope, I've got rounds.
- Can you switch with someone?

09:27.275 --> 09:29.068
I had to take him to
that game signing yesterday.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.404
- Well, I had to drive him
to three practices this week.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.864
- Yeah, well, I had to
thumb-wrestle him for an hour

09:33.948 --> 09:35.074
to build up his dexterity.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.827
I went from French tips
to no tips.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.080
- Sorry, babe. Remember,
their thing is our thing.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.457
Well, right now,
that's your thing.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.966
- Sit up straight, buddy.
Winners don't slouch.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.677
You're a lean, mean,
troll-killing machine.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.554
Are you crying?

09:56.637 --> 09:59.015
There's no crying
in video games.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.267
- No, I'm sweating
under these lights.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.518
- Well, either way,
wipe your face

10:02.601 --> 10:04.770
'cause you're shining.

10:04.854 --> 10:05.855
Yeah, just a couple
more and we are done...

10:05.938 --> 10:09.567
- [camera shutter clicking]
...with this part.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.194
Now go ahead and change
for promos.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.529
- Zack, you said
a few quick pictures.

10:13.612 --> 10:17.658
You guys have been shooting
for five hours.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.201
What did you need all
of that other stuff for?

10:19.285 --> 10:21.746
- The fans love
behind-the-scenes content.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.206
It makes the players
seem like real people.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.960
- James is real people
and real people need sleep.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.712
The boy's exhausted.

10:29.795 --> 10:30.921
Zack, this is too much.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.090
You promised us he would
stay a normal kid.

10:33.174 --> 10:37.219
- Hello? I can't see anything
through these computer glasses.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.764
Help me out before
I bump into anybody.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.640
- Uh, you'd better not
bump into anything.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.517
Those glasses are
a highly complex,

10:43.601 --> 10:45.311
Internet-connected
machine.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.146
It's like having
two computer screens

10:47.229 --> 10:49.065
like right in front
of your eyes.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.107
- These stupid glasses
won't stop checking email

10:50.191 --> 10:52.943
in front of my face.

10:53.027 --> 10:56.155
Oh, I got some more spam
from Grandma Maggie.

10:56.238 --> 11:00.242
The subject line is
Kitten in a Watering Can.

11:00.326 --> 11:04.497
[laughing]
Okay, this one's adorable.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.040
- Zack, how is
he supposed to walk,

11:06.123 --> 11:08.125
when he can't see
the person in front of him?

11:08.209 --> 11:08.959
- He can,
if he feeds your face

11:09.043 --> 11:11.253
through the recognition
software.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.922
- I tried.
It's not working.

11:13.005 --> 11:17.259
It thinks Dad's someone
named Blair Underwood.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.345
- Ooh, dare to dream.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.436
- Honey, maybe we should rethink
this whole pro gaming business.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.106
- I know, Charlie, but we can't
take this away from James.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.440
He's loving every
minute of it.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.485
- I hate this.
I wanna quit.

11:34.568 --> 11:35.986
- You wanna quit?

11:36.070 --> 11:38.155
Are you sure?
I thought this was your dream.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.782
- My dream was
playing video games

11:39.865 --> 11:40.950
and not having to work.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.286
This is work. These people
are ruining fun.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.831
- Okay, James, go upstairs

11:46.914 --> 11:48.666
and change out of
those ridiculous clothes.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.960
You look like
a robot jockey.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.838
- No, we're gonna put
these glasses back on here

11:53.921 --> 11:56.382
and get back and do
some promos.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.300
- If James doesn't
wanna do this,

11:58.384 --> 11:59.760
he doesn't have
to do this.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.137
- Yes, he does.

12:01.220 --> 12:05.349
You guys clicked accept
on a contract which is binding.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.768
So, why don't you buck up

12:07.852 --> 12:13.399
and let's start taping
some promos.

12:13.482 --> 12:17.361
Okay, so, hold the product.
Read the copy.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.781
- Hi, I'm pro video gamer
James Phillips,

12:20.865 --> 12:23.325
and I love George Washington's
Wild Wings,

12:23.409 --> 12:26.495
a revolutionary taste
in chicken parts.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.708
So tender you can eat
them with wooden teeth.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.504
- How you holding up, buddy?
- Can't talk.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.213
Zack say's I'm
contractually obligated

12:36.297 --> 12:39.258
to play four more hours.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.843
- I'm here with you
all the way,

12:40.926 --> 12:42.678
until my bedtime

12:42.761 --> 12:45.014
in 20 minutes.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.183
- I'm starving, too.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.393
- Want some more
veggie jerky?

12:49.477 --> 12:51.770
- No. I can't eat
any more of that.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.522
I'd kill for
something sweet.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.484
- Oh, man, do you know who makes
the best brownies?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.736
That new kid Darren Mochler.

12:58.819 --> 13:03.908
- Oh, is he talking about
that Darren Mochler kid again?

13:03.991 --> 13:05.201
- You'd be talking
about him, too,

13:05.284 --> 13:07.620
if you'd seen his series
of watercolors.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.957
- You got my swag?

13:12.041 --> 13:13.959
- That depends. Did you take
care of my chores?

13:14.043 --> 13:15.544
- Did the dishes,
took out the trash.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.213
- What about the report?

13:17.296 --> 13:19.715
- Five pages on Switzerland.
Oughta be about a "B"-plus.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.550
- What am I, the guy
that discovered Switzerland?

13:21.634 --> 13:24.887
Knock it down to a "C."

13:24.970 --> 13:27.223
- That oughta do it.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.392
Now where's my swag bag?

13:30.476 --> 13:32.436
- [snapping fingers]

13:32.520 --> 13:33.354
- And there'd better be

13:33.437 --> 13:36.273
some Washington Wing
gift cards in it.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.150
I have a ladies night
on Thursday,

13:38.234 --> 13:39.777
and I'm sick of
footing the bill.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.237
Check comes
and all of a sudden,

13:41.320 --> 13:44.281
folks can't remember
what they ordered.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.408
- Now I've got this
science fair coming up.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.451
Do you know how to
make a volcano?

13:47.535 --> 13:50.454
- Do you know how to
endorse a red convertible?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.122
- I don't wanna
endorse anything.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.750
But Dad's lawyer says
my contract is unbreakable.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.293
- Aw, that's tough, man.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.420
Wanna play a little
Zombie Frogs instead

13:58.504 --> 14:00.089
to take your mind
off of it?

14:00.172 --> 14:02.424
I've got 15 more minutes.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.300
- No, I can't.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.261
Zack says most thumb
injuries occur

14:05.344 --> 14:07.263
when you're
playing for fun.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.848
- You mean he won't even
let you play for fun?

14:09.932 --> 14:15.312
Who does that
to a 12-year-old kid?

14:15.396 --> 14:18.315
Do you want me to twist
this guy's arm?

14:18.399 --> 14:24.738
By which I mean rip it off
and break his knees with it?

14:24.822 --> 14:27.825
- Let's call that
Plan "B."

14:27.908 --> 14:30.828
In the meantime,
I'll come up with Plan "A."

14:30.911 --> 14:32.830
- Do you know who
can convince Zack

14:32.913 --> 14:34.748
to let you out
of your contract?

14:34.832 --> 14:37.167
- Darren Mochler?

14:37.251 --> 14:38.877
- No.

14:38.961 --> 14:42.798
Okay, yes.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.426
He's just so charming.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.514
- I know they didn't have
cars in Medieval times,

14:50.598 --> 14:52.474
but do we really have to walk
all the way to the mall?

14:52.558 --> 14:55.269
Which, I should point out,
they also didn't have.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.979
- It is but a large
village market

14:57.062 --> 15:01.191
and I yearn to pay homage
to the Queen of Dairy.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.485
But, first, I've gotta
get something for my headache.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.654
- Oh, gotcha. You can't.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.197
They didn't have
pills back then.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.491
- I know.
[laughs]

15:09.575 --> 15:13.787
That's why I'm using
these--leeches.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.041
Nothing like a little
blood-letting

15:17.124 --> 15:18.751
to cure all that ails me.

15:18.834 --> 15:23.005
- Leeches? Are you
kidding me, Gabby?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.673
- Hey, when I face
a challenge, I meet it.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.676
And when you sayeth
I can't do it,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.178
I'll go get me
some leeches.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.347
- No! No! No!
Stop! Stop!

15:31.430 --> 15:33.849
You are a proud,
confident woman.

15:33.932 --> 15:36.518
I hear you roar.
- And?

15:36.602 --> 15:40.230
- And you can do anything.
- And?

15:40.314 --> 15:41.565
- And I was wrong.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.026
You're not a slave
to materialism.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.944
- That's all
I needed to hear.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.196
- Good.
- No, Gabby, stop!

15:47.279 --> 15:50.366
[wincing]

15:50.449 --> 15:53.035
- Gummy worms.
I'm 15 in Philadelphia.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.079
Where am I gonna
get leeches?

15:55.162 --> 15:56.580
Come here.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.998
Come on. Black Cherry.
It's good.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.672
- Oh, this'll
be beautiful.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.256
I'll use your phone
to record Zack

16:06.340 --> 16:08.717
threatening to exploit
kids for financial gain.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.095
Then we tell him
we'll go public,

16:11.178 --> 16:13.555
unless he lets James
out of his contract.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.059
- Really, Charlie, extortion?
That's your idea?

16:17.142 --> 16:19.603
- It's not extortion.
It's blackmail.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.064
And it's my idea.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.401
- Really, Charlie?
We're listening to James' idea?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.027
- Well, I'm sure
not listening to you,

16:27.111 --> 16:29.196
Miss Their Thing/Our Thing.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.781
- [doorbell rings]
- Zack's here.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.325
Everybody be cool.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.830
- All right, for this to work,
someone's gotta let him in.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.253
- Ah, I am so glad
you guys called.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.754
So now let's talk about

16:45.838 --> 16:47.631
getting Jimbo's head
back in the game.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.134
- Jimbo prefers
to be called James.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.302
- Ah, we just
landed a James

16:52.386 --> 16:54.513
who seems a little
more Jamesy.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.515
So we're callin'
you Jimbo.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.016
- Actually, Zack,
we called you here

16:58.100 --> 17:01.687
to tell you that our
12-year-old son James

17:01.770 --> 17:03.939
will not be working
for you any more,

17:04.021 --> 17:06.942
no matter what
you threaten us with.

17:07.025 --> 17:10.237
But, hypothetically, what would
some of those threats be?

17:10.319 --> 17:11.989
- Sue you for
everything you have.

17:12.071 --> 17:15.784
Starting with this house.
I kind of like this house.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.953
- It's okay.
Say we give in.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.621
How many hours a day

17:19.704 --> 17:21.498
will our poor son James
have to work?

17:21.582 --> 17:23.125
- It's not work.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.792
- No, no, no, no.
Tell it to Charlie.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.463
And annunciate.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.631
- It's not work,
it's fun.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.966
And he's contractually
obligated

17:31.049 --> 17:32.509
to have 35 hours
of fun a week.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.304
- But I have school.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.514
What kind of organization
would take me away from

17:37.598 --> 17:39.349
something I love so dear?

17:39.433 --> 17:42.478
- Well, that is why
it's 35 hours.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.813
Once school's out,
we'll bump you right up to 60.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.523
- Well, that
sounds illegal.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.735
- Oh, it's
downright criminal.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.446
As is this. Oooh.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.363
Uh, by the way, you never
even hit "record."

17:53.447 --> 17:57.659
You just took a selfie
of your pocket.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.413
- I hate technology.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.207
- So, do I still have
a last name,

18:03.290 --> 18:06.460
or is Jimbo like Beyoncé?

18:06.543 --> 18:09.004
- Guys, this is
Darren Mochler.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.672
- Whoa, he is tall.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.716
- I know. I beat everyone
at everything.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.176
Can't help it.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.595
- I was just teaching
Darren Wizardcraft.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.597
He defeated the golden
dragon on his first try.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.098
And he was a pixie.

18:20.182 --> 18:24.353
- You did that as a pixie
your first time playing?

18:24.436 --> 18:26.355
Have you ever thought
about going pro?

18:26.438 --> 18:28.524
- I guess you should
talk to my manager.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.567
- That's me.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.861
- Seriously,
how are you a manager?

18:32.945 --> 18:35.864
- How are you a manager?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.908
- My dad invented
Wizardcraft.

18:37.991 --> 18:41.078
- OTHERS: Oh....

18:41.161 --> 18:42.955
- If you want
Darren Mochler,

18:43.038 --> 18:45.040
you're gonna need to
make a trade for him.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.500
- A trade?

18:46.583 --> 18:48.585
- Yeah, well, all the ice
cream I can carry--

18:48.669 --> 18:50.379
- Aaron, focus.

18:50.462 --> 18:55.050
- Oh, right,
and I want James.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.427
- Let's go talk
to your parents.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.597
Kid's got thumbs
like tree trunks.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.725
- Bro, you saved me.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.227
I thought I was gonna
be forced to play

19:05.310 --> 19:07.396
video games for
the rest of my life.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.565
How horrible
would that be?
