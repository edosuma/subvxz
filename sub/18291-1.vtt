have to push me.

- Push you?
- Mm-hmm.

00:41.918 --> 00:43.669

00:49.884 --> 00:52.762
Girl: Some memories
are so vivid,

00:52.970 --> 00:56.891
they play over again and again
in your mind.

00:57.099 --> 00:59.310
Maybe because they scare you.

00:59.519 --> 01:03.147
Maybe because they remind you
that you don't always know

01:03.356 --> 01:05.274
when you're about to hit
rock bottom.

01:05.483 --> 01:06.651
[car leaving]

01:19.705 --> 01:21.082
Come on, Mom, let's go.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.712
Look, we'll go somewhere nice
like the beach.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.840
And we'll get beef tacos.

01:30.049 --> 01:32.218
You know, the crispy kind
with extra cheese?

01:34.929 --> 01:36.472
Are you coming or not?

01:38.724 --> 01:40.726
Mom, we have to get out of here!

01:40.935 --> 01:42.770
I heard you.

01:42.979 --> 01:45.106
Ruthie, what are we
supposed to do?

01:45.314 --> 01:47.900
I don't have a job,
I don't have any money!

01:48.109 --> 01:51.279
[sighs] Well, if you're
not going, I'm going,

02:07.962 --> 02:11.799
Ruthie, go! Hurry!
Before he comes.

02:12.008 --> 02:13.968
What are you doing
with the TV?

02:14.176 --> 02:16.345
I can sell it.
We're gonna need moving money.

02:16.554 --> 02:19.181
- Okay.
- Come on. Get the trunk.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.226
Go.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.438
Ohh!

02:25.646 --> 02:26.939
Push it.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.317
Okay, come on.

02:29.525 --> 02:32.236
Let's go. Go!

02:35.072 --> 02:37.533
Ruthie: I was the one
who always knew

02:37.742 --> 02:39.327
when it was time to leave.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.579
Eventually,
all of my mother's boyfriends

02:41.787 --> 02:43.539
turned out to be creeps.

02:43.748 --> 02:45.541
We did what we always did.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.294
We took what we could and ran.

02:48.461 --> 02:51.839
This was me... and my mom.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.481
- Get in the car.
- Hey!

03:08.689 --> 03:11.859
This your little girl?
You two look more like sisters?

03:15.529 --> 03:16.989
See you soon.

03:40.096 --> 03:42.515
- Where should we go?
- Hmm?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.975
Anywhere you want.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.061
Anywhere, anywhere.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.854
Where's Harvard?

03:50.564 --> 03:51.732
Boston.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.485
Too cold.

03:54.694 --> 03:56.445
I'll get you a coat.

03:56.654 --> 03:59.281
Mom, I'm 14.
I'm not going to Harvard.

04:08.374 --> 04:09.792
Okay.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.170
So, Boston.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.880
Why not?

04:15.089 --> 04:17.925
You know, maybe I'll become
a doctor.

04:18.134 --> 04:20.219
I was just thinking
the same thing.

04:20.428 --> 04:25.057
You know, Ruthie, you would make
a great doctor.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.642
I would go to you.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.492
<i>Mmm'!</i>

04:45.369 --> 04:46.912
So good.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.206
What are you doing?

04:49.415 --> 04:51.333
- Just one.
- Mom, you have fries.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.502
Those are mine.

04:58.174 --> 05:00.301
This is just like old times.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.805
Now, it's just you and me.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.940
Fuck.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.108
Fuck!

05:16.317 --> 05:17.943
Are you okay?

05:18.152 --> 05:19.653
Mom.

- Ruthie: Yeah.

Mother: Right there.
Hold it. All right?

05:38.547 --> 05:39.965
Now, lift me up.

- Ruthie: Got it?
-mother: Mm-hmm.

05:43.469 --> 05:44.637

- Good?

05:51.393 --> 05:53.979
You're gonna have to push me.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.815
- Push you?
- Mm-hmm.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.149
Ruthie: You sure?

05:57.358 --> 06:00.361
-[mother groans]
- Okay.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.656
Ready? Three, two, one...

06:03.864 --> 06:05.908
- Aaah!

[moaning]

06:10.204 --> 06:11.705
Come on, it's okay.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.791
Oh.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.334
It worked.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.169
- Come on.
- We got it out.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.755
We did get it out.
Come on.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.466
Ruthie: To me, the hanging tooth
felt like rock bottom.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.048
Ruthie: Here, aspirin.

07:05.009 --> 07:08.137
I got Red Bull.
It's cold. Here.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.264
Mother: Thanks.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.100
- Mother: Ahhh!
- Ruthie: Better?

07:13.309 --> 07:14.768
Mother: Ahh.

07:18.731 --> 07:21.483
Ruthie: We're gonna have
a big house,

07:21.692 --> 07:24.445
like at least three stories.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.115
And it's gonna be yellow.

07:29.533 --> 07:32.494
- With black shutters.
- Uggh! With a sunflower.

07:32.703 --> 07:35.080
- Uh-huh.
- I love it.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.459
And we'll grow the grass out
real long.

07:41.211 --> 07:45.925
And we have to have
a big pool, too.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.177
It's gonna be round.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.387
I can just picture it.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.391
And...

07:54.600 --> 07:57.144
I think our pool
should have a slide.

07:57.353 --> 07:59.939
Mother, whispering:
I love slides.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.358
And we can get those rafts.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.819
You know, the ones that have
a place to put your drink.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.821
Mother: Yeah.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.823
It's going to be awesome.

08:10.032 --> 08:11.367
I love it.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.499
I'm picturing it now.

08:23.796 --> 08:26.757
How come you never tell me
about your mom?

08:30.094 --> 08:32.388
How come you always ask?

08:33.764 --> 08:35.265
Because I wanna know.

08:39.102 --> 08:42.063
Well, I had a lot of moms.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.565
Lots of moms.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.901
What were they like?

08:54.618 --> 08:56.829
Sweetie, I don't wanna
remember that.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.333
I just wanna look at you.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.504
[sighs]

09:05.713 --> 09:07.297
You always say that.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.301
Like your feet.

09:11.510 --> 09:14.304
Ruthie: They're not cute.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.015
No!

09:16.223 --> 09:18.350
- Oh, my God.
-[Ruthie laughs]

09:18.559 --> 09:19.518
Wow.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.314
[sighs]

09:40.664 --> 09:42.166
Ruthie: I love you, Mom.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.390
- Ruthie. Ruthie.
- Huh?

10:40.599 --> 10:42.476
Wake up. Come on.

10:44.812 --> 10:45.813
Wake up.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.191
Come on.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.278
We can't be in this parking lot
all day.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.743
Ruthie: My mom didn't believe
in maps.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.579
She just followed the signs.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.957
And when the spirit hit her,
we pulled over.

11:52.171 --> 11:53.797
[thunder rumbles]

12:10.689 --> 12:13.066
- Ruthie: Do you have any gum?
- Uh, yeah, somewhere.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.445
[knock on door]

12:16.653 --> 12:19.114
Be out in a minute!

12:24.077 --> 12:25.454
[knocking]

12:30.250 --> 12:32.920
- Trash.
- Bitch.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.421
Come on, Ruthie.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.133
[muffler rattling]

12:41.345 --> 12:44.681
Ruthie: You think that
the sprinkles have a flavor?

12:44.890 --> 12:46.558
-[muffler clangs]
- What was that?

12:46.767 --> 12:49.102
Mother: Oh, shit, what was that?

12:49.311 --> 12:50.812
Ruthie: Oh, my God,
we're on fire!

12:51.021 --> 12:52.522
Mom, pull over!

12:52.731 --> 12:54.524
Mother: Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

12:54.733 --> 12:56.485
Ruthie: No, Mom! Mom! Stop!

12:56.693 --> 12:59.279
Mother: Get out of the car!
Get your coat!

12:59.488 --> 13:02.574
00h, shit! Shit!

13:02.783 --> 13:05.035
Stand back! Shh-shh-shh!

13:05.244 --> 13:06.787
[sizzling]

13:06.995 --> 13:08.622
Shit.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.750
Fuck.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.795
Piece of shit car!

13:15.003 --> 13:16.880
This shit life!

13:17.089 --> 13:20.133
Why does everything in my life
keep breaking, Ruthie?

13:21.760 --> 13:25.264
Goddamn it.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.765
Fuck!

13:26.974 --> 13:29.059
[drill whirring]

13:48.954 --> 13:51.331
Excuse me, excuse me.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.420
Look, ma'am, we're, uh...

13:56.628 --> 13:59.006
We're looking at $650,
$700 here.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.299
That much?

14:00.507 --> 14:01.883
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.307
My daughter and I are really
struggling to keep going.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.476
That'll about break us.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.355
Maybe there's something
we could do to work it out.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.157
Some sort of special deal.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.829
You thinking about
selling your car?

14:39.046 --> 14:40.839
Oh.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.258
Oh, um, sorry, ma'am.
Uh...

14:43.467 --> 14:46.386
I mean, the muffler alone's
gonna run you $500.

14:46.595 --> 14:49.473
I'll do what I can for you
on our end with labor.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.475
Save you a couple of bucks
that way.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.436
But, uh...

14:54.644 --> 14:57.272
It's the best I can do.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.953
[thumbing through money]

15:58.917 --> 16:00.585
I'm okay.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.131
Don't worry, Mom.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.467
It's gonna be okay.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.517
-[mother sighs]
- What are we gonna do?

16:21.273 --> 16:22.482
Same plan.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.947
We're just gonna...

16:30.532 --> 16:32.117
figure it out as we go.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.939
How does this place look
for breakfast?

17:03.148 --> 17:04.608
Looks closed.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.152
Ruthie, it's perfect. Come on.
You know what to do.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.830
[knocks on window]

17:37.265 --> 17:39.100
-[doorbell jingles]
- Come on in.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.477
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.230
We've been driving for hours.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.689
We're starving.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.691
We don't really open
for a half-hour,

17:46.900 --> 17:49.819
but, lucky for you,
my Uncle Marty loves kids.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.697
Is she really your daughter?

17:52.906 --> 17:54.157
You two look more like sisters.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.869
[chuckles]

17:58.078 --> 17:59.162
You want an OJ?

17:59.371 --> 18:01.039
Ruthie: Oh, yes, please.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.999
Do you think she's --

18:03.208 --> 18:08.088
Waitresses have
very good hearing, you know.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.924
Thank you for inquiring
about between my legs.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.260
I'm sure if you got to know me,
you'd see

18:13.468 --> 18:16.054
that it's what's between my ears
that's more interesting.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.973
Can I have a cup of coffee?

18:18.181 --> 18:20.433
Server: Coming right up.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.602
So, where are you-all headed?

18:22.769 --> 18:23.895
Boston.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.439
Server: Oh, Boston!

18:26.648 --> 18:29.609
I've never been there, but
that's not far from New York.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.695
I've always wanted
to move to New York.

18:31.903 --> 18:33.738
Start a career on the stage.

18:33.947 --> 18:37.951
Of course, I'd love to see
"Grey Gardens" live just once.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.662
With the great
Christine Ebersole.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.330
You know Christine Ebersole.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.457
She came in here once.
I met her.

18:44.666 --> 18:45.834
Told her I loved her.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.961
She said...

18:48.169 --> 18:49.963
"Thank you."

18:50.171 --> 18:51.715
I said, "No problem."

18:53.925 --> 18:55.719

01:04:05.676 --> 01:04:07.261
And, uh...

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:11.348
you know, I don't really have
any family to speak of,

01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:14.685
and so it was really a...

01:04:19.982 --> 01:04:22.860
it was really just me
and my wife.

01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:29.074
Excuse me.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:32.244
But, uh...

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.373
Sorry.

01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:38.375
It was just me and my wife.

01:04:38.584 --> 01:04:40.044
Uh...

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:43.672
So... [clears throat]

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:46.342
You guys, uh...

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:49.803
kind of became my family
after that.

01:04:50.012 --> 01:04:51.263
And, uh...

01:04:51.472 --> 01:04:52.973
when I washed up here,

01:04:53.182 --> 01:04:55.100
I was sitting right
in that chair over there,

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:56.518
and, uh...

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:59.313
I was just very lost.

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:00.689
And, uh...

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:03.442
you people made me feel
very welcome.

01:05:04.485 --> 01:05:05.861
[applause]

01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:12.076
Rita: Ruthie, these cookies
are really good.

01:05:14.036 --> 01:05:15.245
Ruthie?

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:20.751
[sighs]

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:22.461
Ruthie.

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.095
Talk to me.

01:05:34.723 --> 01:05:36.767
How many times
can I say I'm sorry?

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:38.352
I'm sorry.

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:45.317
Ruthie.

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:50.447
I'm trying to clean up.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.700
I wish you'd understand that.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:57.246
Ruthie.

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:05.337
I just want things
to be good again.

01:06:05.546 --> 01:06:06.880
- Good?
- Yes.

01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:10.134
You turn everything you touch
to shit.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:49.423
Come here.

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:22.873
- Can I get you some more coffee?
- Yeah, a little warm-up, thanks.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:42.142
Ruthie: The days felt longer
as business got slower.

01:07:42.351 --> 01:07:45.562
And Tiny's closed earlier
and earlier.

01:07:52.653 --> 01:07:53.862
[door closes]

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.622

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:05.249

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:07.918
Do you mind?

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:09.419
No.

01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:11.004
Ohh!

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:19.179
Did you know that, compared
to the size of the universe,

01:08:19.388 --> 01:08:23.183
humans are one billionth
the size of an ant?

01:08:29.273 --> 01:08:30.691
Hmm.

01:08:39.992 --> 01:08:41.451
You know when it happened to me?

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.375
[whispering]
I didn't tell anybody.

01:08:48.584 --> 01:08:50.877
'Cause I knew
what they would say.

01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:54.214
And I felt dirty all over.

01:08:54.423 --> 01:08:57.593
I didn't want to eat anything.

01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.886
I didn't wanna swallow anything.

01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:04.683
I walked around,
and I was like...

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.727
nobody's ever gonna want me.

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:12.232
Ever.

01:09:12.441 --> 01:09:15.359
I'm damaged goods.

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:18.738
You know what I mean?
It's like, well...

01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:25.078
I'm really scared.

01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:28.415
What are you scared of?

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:33.211
Sometimes God makes mistakes.

01:09:35.339 --> 01:09:37.841
Do you think he made
a mistake with you?

01:09:40.636 --> 01:09:41.720
[sighs]

01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:46.975
I'm scared to live.

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:49.394
I won't even kill myself
because I'm scared of God,

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:52.397
I'm scared of...

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:54.441
you know, whatever is waiting

01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:57.361
up there or down there.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.279
Well, you survived this.

01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:02.366
You can survive anything.

01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:05.118
You just have to take
a deep breath.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:09.206
I wanna move to New York City,

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:11.541
but I don't think
I can survive it.

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:16.755
Hmm.

01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:19.758
Well...

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:27.307
I want you...

01:10:27.516 --> 01:10:28.767
Lips.

01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:32.312
Don't smile.

01:10:32.521 --> 01:10:34.398
I challenge you not to smile.

01:10:34.606 --> 01:10:36.817
No, really, seriously,
don't smile.

01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:38.402
-[Pam chuckles]
- Okay.

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:44.282
I want you to get up,

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:46.743
go back in your trailer,

01:10:46.952 --> 01:10:49.996
put one of
those fancy dresses on...

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:53.333
and be you.

01:10:56.545 --> 01:10:59.881
Group: God, grant me
the serenity to accept

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:01.842
the things I cannot change,

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.803
the courage to change
the things I can,

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:07.347
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

01:11:07.556 --> 01:11:09.391
[indistinct conversation]

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.108
<i>Hey '</i>

01:11:19.443 --> 01:11:20.902
- Hey.
- How you doing?

01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:22.696
I'm okay.
How are you?

01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:24.114
Great.

01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:27.576
What's going on?

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:30.662
Good meeting.

01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:31.913
Yeah.

01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:34.666
Get real good meetings in there.

01:11:34.875 --> 01:11:36.376
How long have you been
coming to this?

01:11:36.585 --> 01:11:40.756
I'm seven months sober now.
Just got seven months.

01:11:42.758 --> 01:11:44.092
Not bad.

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:46.595
It's a start.
How you been doing?

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:49.139
- Eighteen days.
- That's great.

01:11:49.306 --> 01:11:51.433
- I like that number.
- That is a great number.

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.728
It's gonna be different
tomorrow, but congratulations.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:57.105
I was just driving one day
and I saw the sign,

01:11:57.314 --> 01:12:00.317
and sometimes I think...

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:03.153
like if I'm driving
and I see something,

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:06.281
I'm like,
"Oh, I should do that."

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:09.367
You know, "I should do that,"
and so it was like a sign.

01:12:09.576 --> 01:12:11.369
And it was a real sign,
you know,

01:12:11.578 --> 01:12:13.789
It was a sign
and then a real sign.

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:16.041
And then I started coming.

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:18.418
Yeah. You seem good.

01:12:18.627 --> 01:12:21.087
I'm trying to be better,
you know.

01:12:21.296 --> 01:12:24.424
Well, so you're still
pretty new, huh?

01:12:24.633 --> 01:12:28.470
I'd ask you go to get coffee
or something

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:31.014
if you'd been in here
a little longer.

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:33.600
Oh.

01:12:37.062 --> 01:12:39.815
I'd love to...
grab a coffee.

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:42.192
You'd like to go get coffee?

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.860
- With me?
- Yeah.

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:46.988
Sure, if you wanna get coffee,
I'll get coffee.

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:48.782

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.867
- Yeah, do something.
- Okay.

01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:52.285
- Three.
- Seven.

01:12:52.494 --> 01:12:54.454
- Twelve.
- Twenty-two.

01:12:56.248 --> 01:12:57.833
This ain't shit.

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:01.378
When are times gonna change?

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:03.880
I don't know.

01:13:06.007 --> 01:13:07.300
Here, keep it.

Rita: Say you're from Iowa?

01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:18.436
Lee: Yeah, from Council Bluffs.

Rita: What do you like to do
besides Skee-Ball?

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:24.192
- Ohh!
- Lee: A hundred?

- Rita: I got 100!
- Lee: Way to go!

- Rita: Yes!

01:13:29.239 --> 01:13:32.826
Rita: Ooh, you're good.
How'd you get so good?

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:34.703
Lee: A misspent youth.

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:40.500
You got a great smile.

01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:42.502
[chuckles]

01:13:42.711 --> 01:13:45.171
You know, I could fix
your first premolar for you.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.590
I'm a dentist.

01:13:49.217 --> 01:13:51.553
Yeah. Don't be embarrassed.

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:53.847
It's fine.
You can hardly see it.

01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:54.973
Except when you're laughing.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.896
Well, it has been a while
since I've laughed.

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:03.064
Maybe I can fix that
for you, too.

01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:11.156
You're not a dentist.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.241
- Best in town.
- No way.

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:14.326
Top 10 in town.

01:14:14.534 --> 01:14:16.453
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.705
I mean,
look at these pearly whites.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.584
Are all those real?

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:23.668
Yeah.

01:14:23.877 --> 01:14:25.295
Wow!

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:27.672
Come on, show me. I'll give you
a free dental exam.

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:29.090
- Open your mouth.
- No.

01:14:29.299 --> 01:14:30.800
Come on, I can help you.

01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:33.011
Why does everybody hate
going to the dentist?

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:36.056
We do so much good.
You can't hate...

01:14:36.264 --> 01:14:38.141
clean, healthy teeth.

01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:42.103
It's the foundation
for a good life.

01:14:42.312 --> 01:14:43.229
Come on.

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.274
Let's see.

01:14:46.483 --> 01:14:48.193
Oh...

01:14:50.737 --> 01:14:52.405
[chuckles]

01:14:52.614 --> 01:14:54.199
Let me see.

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.911
Tell you now, genetically...

01:14:58.119 --> 01:15:00.246
Hold on.
You got perfect teeth.

01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:02.082
But you're gonna need
a root canal

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:04.542
and a serious cleaning.

01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:07.087
- Rita: Mm-hmm
-[Lee sighs]

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:09.172
And probably a new tooth.

01:15:09.381 --> 01:15:11.383
When's the last time
you saw a dentist?

01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:14.094
When Ruthie was
a baby, I think.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.639
It's okay, we're gonna
get you fixed up.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.435
You're nice.

01:15:39.411 --> 01:15:43.498
Ruthie: I had read about what
they called a financial crisis.

01:15:43.707 --> 01:15:46.501
And now I was seeing it.

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:50.463
Neighbors like "Patti with an I"
and her family just disappeared.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.458
We're fucked.

01:16:47.979 --> 01:16:49.647
Vic: Look at
that single-car garage.

01:16:49.856 --> 01:16:51.357
- Vic: Is that beautiful?
-woman: It's beautiful.

01:16:51.566 --> 01:16:54.611
People don't have garages here.
You will have a garage.

01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:03.078
Why do some people get away
with everything

01:17:03.286 --> 01:17:05.872
while other people
have to suffer for it?

01:17:06.039 --> 01:17:07.957
It's gonna be okay, Ruthie.

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:10.460
It's not fair.

01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:12.921
Sometimes life isn't fair,
but...

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:16.424
we're dealt the cards that
we know how to deal with.

01:17:17.884 --> 01:17:19.219
We're losing our house

01:17:19.427 --> 01:17:21.596
while real-estate assholes
get richer

01:17:21.805 --> 01:17:24.140
and there's nothing
we can do.

01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:26.226
Why is life so hard?

01:17:27.811 --> 01:17:30.355
It's not meant to be like this.
I'm 15!

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:33.024
Ruthie, it's always
gonna be okay.

01:17:33.233 --> 01:17:34.609
You don't know that!

01:17:34.818 --> 01:17:36.903
Everything around us
is collapsing!

01:17:37.112 --> 01:17:39.364
- It's going to be okay.
- Everything is falling apart!

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:41.032
It's going to be okay.

01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:43.660
- Ruthie: It's not gonna be okay!
- Pam: Yes, it is.

01:17:43.868 --> 01:17:45.662
- Ruthie: No, it's not!
- Pam: It's going to be okay.

01:33:42.034 --> 01:33:44.912
because I made damn sure
you don't know!

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.206
So, if you wanna go, go!

01:33:47.414 --> 01:33:50.667
- I will leave!
- Then leave!

01:33:52.795 --> 01:33:54.338
I'll go.

01:34:08.519 --> 01:34:10.646
[dance music playing]

01:34:10.854 --> 01:34:12.648
[laughter]

01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:29.832
Oh, my God!

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.917
Thank you.

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:42.427
[laughter]

01:34:42.636 --> 01:34:45.597
One, two, three.

01:34:48.684 --> 01:34:51.687
She's gonna be fine.
You gotta trust me about that.

01:34:51.895 --> 01:34:55.190
She's at that age where she's
feeling kind of independent.

01:34:55.399 --> 01:34:56.650
She's never done this before.

01:34:56.859 --> 01:34:58.569
She's never run away.
This is not Ruthie.

01:34:58.777 --> 01:35:00.487
Right, but she's 15 now,

01:35:00.654 --> 01:35:02.447
so she's gonna start doing
stuff like this.

01:35:02.656 --> 01:35:04.700
It's totally normal.
You did it, right?

01:35:04.908 --> 01:35:06.493
And I did it.
Come on.

01:35:06.702 --> 01:35:08.287
It's what kids do.

01:35:08.495 --> 01:35:09.830
I promise.

01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:11.707
Come here.

01:35:11.915 --> 01:35:13.542
Come here, gimme a hug.

01:35:15.919 --> 01:35:16.920
Come on.

01:35:17.129 --> 01:35:19.256
[music pounding]

01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:40.360
What?

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:42.613
Um...

01:35:42.821 --> 01:35:44.323
She...

01:35:44.531 --> 01:35:46.491
She followed in after me.

01:35:49.453 --> 01:35:51.038
Trash!

01:35:52.581 --> 01:35:53.498
Bitch.

01:36:07.638 --> 01:36:10.474
[sobbing]

01:36:10.682 --> 01:36:12.768
[truck horn blaring]

01:36:33.455 --> 01:36:35.123
[knock on door]

01:36:37.209 --> 01:36:38.502
Okay.

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:40.462
[cat mews]

01:36:41.964 --> 01:36:44.007
[knocking]

01:36:50.013 --> 01:36:51.473
Rita: Thank you, Pam.

01:36:51.682 --> 01:36:53.225
Pam, whispering: I'm gonna go
make some coffee.

01:36:53.433 --> 01:36:54.559
Rita: Okay.

01:37:02.734 --> 01:37:03.735
I'm sorry.

01:37:09.866 --> 01:37:11.159
I'm sorry, too.

01:37:17.207 --> 01:37:21.211
Sometimes I just screw up,
Ruthie.

01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:23.171
You know, I try to be
a good mom.

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:25.924
I've always tried, but I never
really knew what I was doing.

01:37:26.133 --> 01:37:27.843
And when you were little,
it was just...

01:37:28.051 --> 01:37:29.720
it was a lot easier
because if you fell,

01:37:29.928 --> 01:37:31.596
you know, I knew how to fix it.

01:37:31.805 --> 01:37:35.559
Like I could just make
your boo-boo better, and...

01:37:37.144 --> 01:37:39.646
And now I don't always know
what to do.

01:37:41.648 --> 01:37:42.858
I know.

01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:45.277
[sighs]

01:37:47.988 --> 01:37:50.073
I love you, Mom.

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:56.747
I love you, Ruthie.

01:38:02.169 --> 01:38:04.588
You're a big girl now.

01:38:04.796 --> 01:38:05.672
[chuckles]

01:38:05.839 --> 01:38:07.007
Yeah.

01:38:12.429 --> 01:38:14.556
I never realized before...

01:38:14.765 --> 01:38:16.016
What?

01:38:18.727 --> 01:38:21.396
You need me
as much as I need you.

01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:27.027
Ruthie.

01:38:29.321 --> 01:38:31.490
Honey, I need you more.

01:38:40.791 --> 01:38:42.334
Mom, that's my clip.

01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:43.752
You gave it to me.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.295
When did I give it to you?

01:38:45.504 --> 01:38:47.255
You said you didn't want
to wear clips anymore.

01:38:47.464 --> 01:38:48.882
I did not give it to you.

01:38:49.091 --> 01:38:50.550
Uh, this is my skirt.

01:38:50.759 --> 01:38:52.761
Yeah, but this was for a party.

01:38:52.969 --> 01:38:55.806
This was for... a night.

01:38:56.014 --> 01:38:58.183
My hair was in my face.

01:38:58.392 --> 01:39:01.520
I saw you using it before.
I just didn't say anything.

01:39:01.728 --> 01:39:02.604
Here.

01:39:04.439 --> 01:39:06.191
Yes, you can drive.

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.776
Oh, my God!

01:39:07.984 --> 01:39:10.862
