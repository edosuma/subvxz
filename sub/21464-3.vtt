00:04.922 --> 00:06.631
<i>If you think that you</i>

00:06.632 --> 00:09.300
<i>and the group you came here
with from San Diego,</i>

00:09.301 --> 00:11.345
<i>if you think you folks are happy now,</i>

00:11.971 --> 00:14.348
<i>wait until they open those doors.</i>

00:14.640 --> 00:16.142
<i>A new car!</i>

00:32.783 --> 00:34.159
<i>I hope...</i>

00:34.160 --> 00:37.037
Hey, cutie, you should rotate,
or you're gonna get bedsores.

00:37.038 --> 00:39.749
Hey, I walked to the fridge
and back twice today.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.877
Oh, twice.
Big exercise.

00:43.085 --> 00:44.712
- Mwah!
- So what's on the menu?

00:44.920 --> 00:45.879
Soup, I guess.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.339
I just got back from the clinic
about three minutes ago.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.009
- Ooh, that's a long day.
- Right?

00:50.384 --> 00:51.552
Is that from Talbot's?

00:52.887 --> 00:56.098
No. Uh, it's for Dad.
It feels like a video.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.893
Well, people have been sending things
since <i>The Times</i> article.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.063
Do I need to be worried about
all this fan mail that you're getting?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.355
Well, that depends
how the soup turns out.

01:04.356 --> 01:06.024
That's my guy.

01:06.025 --> 01:09.111
Ew. Are you seriously joking
about having an affair?

01:10.446 --> 01:11.988
Hey, are you gonna watch this
with me later?

01:11.989 --> 01:13.491
It's the Tournament of Champions.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.577
Dad? Dad?

01:18.621 --> 01:20.122
Charlie!

01:20.498 --> 01:22.792
- Charlie!
- Oh.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.711
Oh, no. No, no, no.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.422
You've built your connection.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.424
He knows you can talk
about his ideas,

01:30.758 --> 01:33.343
that you're his equal,
that he made the right call

01:33.344 --> 01:35.428
in asking to speak to you
and only you.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.555
Now turn it.

01:37.348 --> 01:39.307
No more feelings,
no more theories.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.851
Hit him hard with the facts.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.812
He's about to be buried
under a mountain of hard evidence.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.231
Going to trial is suicide.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.857
Control, he's desperate for control.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.026
He thinks going to trial
will give him that control.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.905
Make him understand
that we own the courtroom.

01:53.656 --> 01:56.408
The only thing that gives him wiggle room
is to plead guilty.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.413
He wants the control.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.251
He loves the control.

02:12.758 --> 02:13.884
Here we go.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.387
You can do this, Fitz.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.524
You didn't happen to bring
those stamps, did you?

02:30.442 --> 02:32.026
Do you ever think about
what you leave behind

02:32.027 --> 02:33.237
as you move through this world?

02:34.238 --> 02:35.405
Do you mean as in

02:35.406 --> 02:37.658
"leave your campsite cleaner
than when you found it"?

02:39.243 --> 02:42.954
My dad, he made me join
the Boy Scouts,

02:42.955 --> 02:44.998
thought it might help me make friends.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.958
It didn't.
But it did teach me

02:46.959 --> 02:49.460
to leave my campsite cleaner
than when I found it.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.712
But what does that matter

02:50.713 --> 02:52.881
if the next day,
a logging company comes in

02:52.882 --> 02:54.175
and chops the whole forest down?

02:55.176 --> 02:56.260
I meant it literally--

02:56.760 --> 02:58.011
like all that you leave behind,

02:58.012 --> 03:00.931
like at the Charles Epstein
bombing site.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.643
You know, you hadn't sent
a package in six years,

03:04.977 --> 03:08.062
and then, on June 22, 1993,

03:08.063 --> 03:10.482
man in Tiburon opens
a brown padded envelope, and...

03:14.778 --> 03:16.030
his whole torso is ripped apart.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.992
I think I read about that one
in the newspaper.

03:20.576 --> 03:22.411
- A geneticist, right?
- Yeah.

03:24.788 --> 03:25.873
He had a daughter.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.167
When a man interacts
with the world,

03:29.168 --> 03:30.461
he leaves traces everywhere.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.879
Now, every action,
every step that you took,

03:32.880 --> 03:33.964
you've been shedding clues--

03:34.340 --> 03:36.634
not one, not two,
but hundreds, thousands.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.845
And they have a warehouse
filled with evidence.

03:43.515 --> 03:44.683
This is a trigger switch.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.188
It's precise. It's unique.
It's made by hand.

03:50.064 --> 03:54.151
Forensics found one virtually intact
at the scene.

03:55.486 --> 03:58.072
They found an identical switch
at your cabin.

03:58.364 --> 04:01.575
This is, uh, wire clippings,
springs,

04:02.618 --> 04:04.995
copper pipe,
aluminum scraps--

04:06.247 --> 04:07.248
all matched.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.085
Stamps.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.130
These are stamps
from the Epstein package,

04:16.006 --> 04:17.508
and these are stamps
from your cabin.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.135
You traveled three days
from Lincoln, Montana,

04:21.136 --> 04:23.555
to mail the package
in San Francisco.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.432
You paid cash,
you used disguises,

04:26.433 --> 04:29.269
which was smart,
except, in your cabin,

04:29.270 --> 04:31.397
we found six pairs
of sunglasses,

04:31.730 --> 04:33.440
some fake mustaches,

04:33.857 --> 04:36.652
and then your journal entries
logging your disguises.

04:37.403 --> 04:40.823
This is the chemical components
of the explosive mixture

04:41.573 --> 04:45.035
and, um, the epoxy
that was used in the box,

04:46.078 --> 04:48.539
your typewriter that was used
for the address label,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.834
carbon paper, and a receipt
for the carbon paper.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.461
It just goes on and on,

04:54.628 --> 04:57.630
and, Ted, they have
thousands of pieces of evidence

04:57.631 --> 04:59.299
that can link you to the Unabom,

04:59.300 --> 05:00.592
but they only need one to convict you.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.971
They're gonna bury you
under a mountain of evidence,

05:04.388 --> 05:06.180
and all your autonomy
is gonna go out the window

05:06.181 --> 05:07.308
the first day of trial.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.812
He's looking good.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.064
Now reel him in.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.860
I want you to change the world.

05:18.027 --> 05:20.321
I want you to start a revolution.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.197
But if you fight this...

05:24.033 --> 05:26.410
if you fight this,

05:27.077 --> 05:29.829
you are gonna lose control
of everything in your life.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.623
You're gonna be a helpless cog
in the machine of justice

05:32.624 --> 05:34.752
until they strap you down
in the electric chair.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.213
You have one option.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.257
It's gonna give you
some bargaining power,

05:41.258 --> 05:42.426
but you got only one.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.888
Plead guilty.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.098
All of this is for one bomb.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.767
There were 15 others

05:50.184 --> 05:51.810
that we haven't even talked about.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.522
So trust me. This is all there is.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.157
All right.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.620
If that's my only option, I'll do it.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.045
- That's it, right?
- That's it.

06:19.338 --> 06:20.881
Can I ask you one question?

06:23.384 --> 06:24.885
Anything.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.845
Since you've been so helpful

06:27.846 --> 06:30.223
walking me through
what evidence the FBI has,

06:30.224 --> 06:32.892
I was hoping
you might confirm for me

06:32.893 --> 06:35.228
something I've suspected
for a long time

06:35.229 --> 06:37.189
but could never get
a straight answer to.

06:37.606 --> 06:42.610
But it seems to me that there is
no forensic evidence whatsoever

06:42.611 --> 06:44.654
tying me to these heinous crimes

06:44.655 --> 06:46.365
besides what you found in my cabin.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.201
Yeah, but they got so much
evidence of every type.

06:49.535 --> 06:52.454
Imagine if you could throw out
all that evidence.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.706
There'd be nothing left, right?

06:55.707 --> 06:57.250
Because it's all here on the table.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.128
You just laid it all out
in front of me.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.339
Yeah.

07:03.465 --> 07:07.427
James, do you really
not have any idea

07:07.428 --> 07:08.887
why I brought you here?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.143
Huh.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.651
This is your search warrant.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.279
It's based on
your linguistic analysis.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.366
This is--This is what
got you into my cabin,

07:29.533 --> 07:33.077
and the prosecution's entire case

07:33.078 --> 07:37.541
<i>rests on this one document,
your--your document.</i>

07:37.916 --> 07:39.710
No, what--
what's he doing?

07:40.419 --> 07:42.962
<i>So I thought
we could discuss something</i>

07:42.963 --> 07:45.549
<i>I learned about only recently,
called</i>

07:46.425 --> 07:48.510
fruit of the poisonous tree.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.388
That's the option that
you're neglecting to mention--

07:52.389 --> 07:55.766
the option where I get
all this evidence thrown out

07:55.767 --> 07:57.311
and I walk away a free man.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.732
The only evidence connecting me
to the Unabom attacks

08:02.733 --> 08:04.233
was found inside my cabin.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.695
The only reason the FBI was legally
allowed to search my cabin

08:07.696 --> 08:09.655
was because of
your search warrant,

08:09.656 --> 08:14.160
but if that search warrant
was issued on false pretenses

08:14.161 --> 08:17.038
or based on arguments
that fail to meet the burden of proof,

08:17.039 --> 08:19.749
well, then all the evidence
found at that location

08:19.750 --> 08:21.752
is deemed fruit of the poisonous tree.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.545
It's tainted.
It's inadmissible.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.838
It's got to be thrown out.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.341
So if the search warrant goes,

08:28.342 --> 08:33.305
then all their mountains
of evidence simply...

08:35.349 --> 08:36.600
disappear.

08:39.728 --> 08:41.230
Do you follow?

08:42.147 --> 08:44.525
<i>The whole case depends on
the evidence from the cabin.</i>

08:44.816 --> 08:47.235
The evidence from the cabin
depends on the search warrant,

08:47.236 --> 08:49.988
but the search warrant depends
on this thing called...

08:50.364 --> 08:52.406
forensic linguistics,

08:52.407 --> 08:56.745
which is a field that you just invented,
James R. Fitzgerald.

08:57.329 --> 09:00.039
There is no precedent
in all legal history

09:00.040 --> 09:03.000
for a search warrant
based on linguistic analysis.

09:03.001 --> 09:06.587
So the question I then place
before the court becomes,

09:06.588 --> 09:10.634
do we trust this man as so expert
that we trust his invention?

09:11.677 --> 09:15.179
Where did you get your
formal training in linguistics,

09:15.180 --> 09:17.307
your PhD, your Master's?

09:19.935 --> 09:22.728
As I hear it, the majority of
your law enforcement career

09:22.729 --> 09:25.816
was spent on the graffiti squad
of a small-town police department.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.275
Is that right?

09:27.276 --> 09:30.611
Now, would you say that
this time spent reading graffiti

09:30.612 --> 09:32.406
constitutes your linguistic training?

09:32.864 --> 09:35.324
<i>By the way, we haven't even gotten
to the content of the warrant yet.</i>

09:35.325 --> 09:36.826
- Shit. Shit!
- Oh, God. Oh.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.745
<i>Perhaps I should leave you
with my annotations.</i>

09:39.746 --> 09:41.455
<i>They're quite extensive.</i>

09:41.456 --> 09:42.666
We gotta get him out of there.

09:43.709 --> 09:44.960
I was right.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.713
Mm. Well, it doesn't really matter
if you're right.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.590
It matters if they believe in you.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.091
And if they don't believe in you,

09:52.092 --> 09:55.678
then they can't trust the warrant.
And if they can't trust the warrant,

09:55.679 --> 09:57.639
then I walk out of here.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.558
Interview's over. Stop.
Get him outta here.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.310
<i>Everything you touched is tainted.</i>

10:02.311 --> 10:03.603
<i>You need look no further.</i>

10:03.604 --> 10:05.187
Give me those.
Those notes are privileged.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.732
You are the poisonous tree.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.901
<i>Get him out.
Don't say anything else.</i>

10:12.738 --> 10:14.197
Good chat.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.434
I found one.
I found a mistake.

10:44.269 --> 10:47.688
Paragraph 185,
"As for the negative consequences

10:47.689 --> 10:49.940
"of eliminating industrial society,

10:49.941 --> 10:52.194
well, you can't eat your cake
and have it, too."

10:53.862 --> 10:58.450
"Eat your cake...
and have it, too."

10:59.910 --> 11:01.078
It's backwards.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.455
It's backwards.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.042
Why aren't you cheering?
I found a mistake.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.044
We're looking for mistakes.
I found the first real mistake.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.631
Okay. Cool. But what does it
tell us about the Unabomber?

11:13.423 --> 11:15.175
We're looking for a "wudder," right,

11:16.051 --> 11:18.261
something that tells us who he is,
where he comes from.

11:18.553 --> 11:21.139
Thank you. Thank you for quoting me
telling you what to do.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.433
What crawled up your ass and died?

11:23.975 --> 11:26.687
Ackerman gave us an office
and a team to comb the manifesto.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.563
After two weeks,
we got nothing.

11:29.564 --> 11:30.482
Well, I have something.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.527
Check it out, yo.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.114
Manifesto, paragraph 11.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.415
These aren't mistakes.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.542
Someone calls me a "broad,"
that's a mistake,

11:49.543 --> 11:50.544
one they would not make
a second time.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.586
"Negro" will get your ass kicked.

11:52.587 --> 11:53.714
Ernie, you're a nerd.

11:54.423 --> 11:55.632
Want to test a Negro?

11:55.799 --> 11:57.425
Huh, broad?

11:57.426 --> 11:58.260
Okay.
Let's go with this.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.221
Let's go with it, all right?
What's it telling us?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.224
What's--
Who talks like this?

12:04.516 --> 12:06.267
Mm-hmm.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.103
My dad, Wally,
he talked like this, but...

12:10.522 --> 12:11.732
It's generational.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.233
It's generational.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.194
So no one 30 to 40 years old

12:16.403 --> 12:18.071
would use those words, right?

12:18.530 --> 12:20.282
- Right?
- Correct. So what are we saying?

12:20.699 --> 12:22.616
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.118
What--what--
what else does it tell us?

12:24.119 --> 12:25.328
Well, well, also,
if he used these words,

12:25.495 --> 12:27.747
then this is a guy who's never
been around black folks...

12:27.748 --> 12:29.039
- Mm-hmm.
- or women.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.416
- There you go.
- And trust me.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.543
When you're pretty much
the only black guy in the UTF,

12:32.544 --> 12:34.754
you get lots of practice
picking up on language clues.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.424
So with that, he wouldn't live
in San Francisco proper, right?

12:38.008 --> 12:40.260
Except every letter and package
was mailed from here.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.220
Ooh.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.265
Okay. All right.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.225
Don't worry about it.
Let's keep playing.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.852
Maybe he does,

12:49.853 --> 12:53.648
'cause he lives in the suburbs
within driving distance.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.233
Yes.
Give me everything.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.986
Give me every language clue
that we have found in the manifesto.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.698
Okay, well, um, "Negro,"
"chick," "broad,"

13:01.990 --> 13:04.074
"eat your cake," though I don't
know where that gets us.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.701
Just keep going.
Go on. Come on.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.162
Uh, the long sentences,
the formal style--

13:08.163 --> 13:09.371
trying to sound smart.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.624
Okay. The variant spellings,
they're--they're not wrong.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.417
They're just unusual,
like "willful" with one L and...

13:13.418 --> 13:15.252
"Analyze" with the S,
not a Z.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.671
Plus the numbered paragraphs,
numbered end notes,

13:17.672 --> 13:20.382
a corrections page,
works-cited pages...

13:20.383 --> 13:22.051
- Okay.
- It's a weird format.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.677
Okay. Okay.
So what does that tell us?

13:23.678 --> 13:24.887
I don't know.
It's formatted weird.

13:24.888 --> 13:25.971
Aw, come on!

13:25.972 --> 13:27.182
Dude, what do you want?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.684
We've been looking for wudder.
There's no wudder.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.312
I mean, it's an awesome idea.
We gave it a shot.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.356
But discretion is
the better part of valor.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.398
I don't want to be
the next stamp guy.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.652
I mean, he's off interviewing
Eugene O'Neill's grandkids' dog walker,

13:39.653 --> 13:41.029
and his career is over

13:41.363 --> 13:43.073
because he didn't know
when to say "uncle."

13:56.169 --> 13:58.421
Maybe we should call in the experts.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.468
Are you going to
the, uh, San Diego thing?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.720
- I'm not going.
- It's a good one.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.598
Thank you all for coming,

14:09.599 --> 14:11.600
for taking the time
to read the manifesto.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.143
You've all been
asked here today

14:13.144 --> 14:15.271
because you were either cited
in the manifesto

14:15.272 --> 14:17.065
or you work in
a related academic field.

14:17.691 --> 14:21.068
Look, I'm just hoping
that you can shed some light

14:21.069 --> 14:22.779
on who the author is
based on what you read.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.281
Are there things
that you recognize

14:25.282 --> 14:27.449
in the ideas,
in the language,

14:27.450 --> 14:29.076
you know, from someone
that you work with,

14:29.077 --> 14:31.787
a colleague
or former student maybe?

14:31.788 --> 14:33.498
If one of my students wrote this,

14:33.999 --> 14:35.499
he'd be out of the program.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.419
There's no way this guy
would pass peer review.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.879
Eh, you could scrape
by writing like this

14:39.880 --> 14:41.506
in the hard sciences maybe.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.008
Oh, please.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.801
The, uh, work coming
out of your department

14:45.802 --> 14:48.137
hasn't been publishable in 20 years.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.264
- Oh, please.
- I actually do have a question.

14:51.308 --> 14:54.393
Excuse me.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.645
Excuse me.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.773
Was there a corrections page
appended to the front?

15:00.984 --> 15:01.818
Yeah.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.528
And is it called "Corrections"
or "Errata"?

15:04.529 --> 15:06.614
Was it in English or Latin?

15:06.615 --> 15:09.408
Leave it to the comparative
linguistics grad student

15:09.409 --> 15:10.952
to focus on what's relevant.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.537
You know, the Unabomber
had one thing right.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.206
Did you all read paragraph 88?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.460
"Some scientific work
has no conceivable relation

15:19.461 --> 15:21.795
to the welfare of the human race,"

15:21.796 --> 15:24.299
comparative linguistics,
for example.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.302
And you think your work is relevant?

15:33.683 --> 15:35.393
Oh, well, listen to the poli-sci...

15:37.896 --> 15:39.189
Time flies
when you're having fun.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.901
So, who do we see
about our per diem?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.527
Front desk.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.953
Fitz, good stuff today?

15:53.912 --> 15:55.497
Fill me in first thing tomorrow.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.165
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.500
You can get your per diem
at the front desk.

15:59.501 --> 16:00.627
No, no. It's not that.
I just...

16:01.378 --> 16:02.921
My question
was never answered.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.174
Is it "Corrections" or "Errata"?

16:09.177 --> 16:12.347
It's, uh, "Corrections."
Why?

16:13.848 --> 16:14.933
Come look at the format.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.560
- It's weird.
- Mm. To you, it's weird.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.729
To me,
these numbered paragraphs,

16:20.730 --> 16:23.148
the numbered end notes,
and the corrections page,

16:23.149 --> 16:24.734
I mean, this is a dissertation.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.403
This is standard formatting
for a PhD.

16:27.404 --> 16:28.904
I asked everyone about the formatting.

16:28.905 --> 16:29.905
Well, that's the thing.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.324
Modern dissertations look
totally different now.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.910
The word processor changed everything.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.912
This is in the style of
an older graduate thesis paper.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.789
I noticed these kind of things,

16:38.790 --> 16:42.918
and this style of end notes
was only used before 1972-ish,

16:42.919 --> 16:44.211
when they changed to footnotes.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.129
The corrections page?

16:45.130 --> 16:47.716
It was called errata
before 1967.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.177
Meaning he learned the formatting
between '67 and '72.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.263
More than that.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.681
Only PhD candidates
used this style.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.308
So if he's still using
this format 20 years later...

16:58.309 --> 16:59.852
He must have written
a dissertation.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.186
He must have written a dissertation

17:01.187 --> 17:03.023
- between '67 and '72.
- And '72.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.067
- Very nice.
- Comparative linguistics,

17:07.027 --> 17:09.320
not as useless
as the Unabomber thinks.

17:12.323 --> 17:13.283
Do you have a minute?

17:17.412 --> 17:19.831
Technically, you're not
supposed to see this, but...

17:23.835 --> 17:26.920
We've been analyzing
the language of the manifesto,

17:26.921 --> 17:29.966
looking for clues as to who he is.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.717
Wow.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.470
We've been looking for mistakes
on the theory that,

17:34.471 --> 17:36.847
well, like,
I say "wudder" and, um...

17:36.848 --> 17:39.892
Idiolect. It's what we call
the speech patterns

17:39.893 --> 17:41.394
of one specific person.

17:41.728 --> 17:47.858
Idiolect. Idiolect, right.
Um, it's like a linguistic fingerprint.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.360
I mean, we'll work out who he is by...

17:50.361 --> 17:52.112
Based on how he speaks. Yes.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.823
So you've been
looking for mistakes.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.826
Right.
We found these...

17:57.786 --> 17:59.204
- Except they're not mistakes.
- Except they aren't mistakes.

17:59.662 --> 18:00.829
That's right.
They're variant spellings.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.458
They're unusual,
but they're technically correct.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.167
And is he consistent?

18:05.168 --> 18:07.211
He uses the same spellings
every time?

18:07.212 --> 18:09.756
Yeah, letters, manifesto--
it's the same unusual spelling.

18:13.218 --> 18:16.096
Is this totally amateur?
Like, am I--am I doing all right?

18:16.262 --> 18:18.848
Are you kidding?
This is cutting-edge.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.475
Using language to solve crimes?

18:21.476 --> 18:23.103
There's not even a name
for what you're doing.

18:24.062 --> 18:27.356
So if he's consistent,
that suggests a style guide,

18:27.357 --> 18:28.607
you know, somewhere where
he learned to spell this way,

18:28.608 --> 18:29.984
a newspaper, magazine,

18:30.443 --> 18:32.945
somewhere that had a style guide
for their editors

18:32.946 --> 18:35.490
that matches these spellings.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.491
And if we can find that style guide...

18:37.492 --> 18:39.076
We're closer to finding his idiolect.

18:39.077 --> 18:40.662
And if we can find his idiolect...

18:40.954 --> 18:42.621
Then we find the Unabomber.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.540
Yes.

18:44.541 --> 18:45.750
No.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.171
That's it?

18:50.380 --> 18:51.297
This is Berkeley.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.675
The obsolete style guide sections
are pretty thin.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.009
I could start hitting
the local public libraries

18:56.010 --> 18:57.720
in Marin County today
if you want to.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.764
Just keep reading.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.016
This is crazy, man.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.853
Needle in a haystack for what,
a few spelling mistakes?

19:05.854 --> 19:07.856
It's not mistakes.
It's idiolect.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.526
Who is that?

19:12.527 --> 19:14.194
It's just Ackerman.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.238
He wants us to brief him,
but we got nothing to present.

19:16.239 --> 19:17.073
He'll be fine.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.538
- Hello?
- Okay.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.833
Just tell him I'm on my way.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.585
Dude, it's some woman for you.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.759
Hey!

19:37.760 --> 19:38.845
I found it.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.972
The <i>Chicago Tribune,</i>

19:41.139 --> 19:42.973
it's their in-house style guide.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.725
Their publisher,
Robert McCormick,

19:44.726 --> 19:46.143
was this big proponent

19:46.144 --> 19:48.562
of this fringe simplified
spelling movement.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.731
In 1949,
he forced it on his editors.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.149
In 1954, when he died,

19:52.150 --> 19:54.067
they switched back
to standard spelling.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.737
"Analyse." "Wilfuly."
"Licence."

19:57.572 --> 19:59.740
Instalment with one L.
He uses that in U-11.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.325
This is it.
Can I keep this?

20:01.326 --> 20:02.243
Yes.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.496
Thank you.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.373
- Fitz?
- Yeah?

20:07.832 --> 20:09.083
We're late.
It started.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.337
So from that initial subject pool
of 15 million,

20:12.754 --> 20:15.255
we put additional parameters
on the MPP,

20:15.256 --> 20:17.675
which narrowed it to 2,500.

20:18.426 --> 20:21.262
We're calling that
our Tier 3 subject group.

20:21.596 --> 20:24.265
Tier 2--
subjects with criminal records,

20:24.599 --> 20:27.017
mechanical
or explosives training,

20:27.018 --> 20:30.480
in a nexus between
Salt Lake City and the Bay Area.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.898
Tier 1--top 20.

20:32.899 --> 20:36.236
High level of confidence
that one of these guys is our man.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.906
They're all under active surveillance,
or they're at large,

20:40.657 --> 20:43.159
being sought by
Special Operations Group.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.577
Excellent.

20:45.745 --> 20:50.707
Fitz, have you got, uh, anything
from those nutty professors

20:50.708 --> 20:52.210
that can move the needle?

20:53.211 --> 20:54.878
Actually, yes.

20:54.879 --> 20:58.298
We have solid linguistic evidence
that he grew up in Chicago

20:58.299 --> 21:00.300
and that he learned
his spelling and grammar

21:00.301 --> 21:01.928
from the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i>

21:02.595 --> 21:04.138
And how solid is this?

21:04.639 --> 21:06.057
Solid.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.101
You just made somebody
very happy.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.436
Confirmed something
that I've been saying.

21:13.064 --> 21:16.234
Leo Frederick Burt,
born in Chicago.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.820
Pass these around.

21:19.529 --> 21:22.198
Leo Burt,
my pick for suspect number one.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.032
Born and raised in Chicago,

21:24.033 --> 21:26.035
flirted with SDS and the Panthers

21:26.327 --> 21:28.997
before joining a radical
Weather Underground splinter group,

21:30.039 --> 21:32.499
involved in a series of
anti-establishment attacks

21:32.500 --> 21:33.835
in the late '70s,

21:34.294 --> 21:36.421
including--drumroll, please--

21:37.130 --> 21:39.340
three attempted bombings.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.508
Went into hiding
around the same time

21:41.509 --> 21:43.677
that the Unabomber
started his attacks,

21:43.678 --> 21:46.431
and, plus, as you can see,
he's a dead ringer for the sketch.

21:47.265 --> 21:48.933
You want to add anything
to that, Fitz?

21:49.684 --> 21:52.520
Well, it's also likely
that he had a university affiliation,

21:53.396 --> 21:55.522
you know, that the previous profile

21:55.523 --> 21:56.565
suggested little or no college--

21:56.566 --> 21:58.568
Fitz, your voice
is music to my ears today.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.902
He went to University
of Wisconsin-Madison.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.613
That's where he got hooked up
with the radical groups.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.450
All right.
Let's alert S.O.G.

22:06.451 --> 22:09.162
and start re-interviewing
all known associates.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.165
Let's see if we can drag
Leo Burt out of hiding.

22:13.708 --> 22:16.502
Awesome work, guys.
Meet me upstairs. We'll talk through it.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.628
Get you involved in that Tier 1 squad.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.881
Just a second, before everyone goes.

22:20.882 --> 22:23.300
- Um...
- Is there something else?

22:23.301 --> 22:24.302
Fitz, leave it be.

22:24.844 --> 22:25.720
It's just a question.

22:26.304 --> 22:27.388
How old is Leo Burt?

22:29.390 --> 22:31.559
47, born 1948. Why?

22:32.810 --> 22:33.936
He's too young.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.563
- He's possibly too young.
- It's not possibly.

22:36.564 --> 22:39.066
He learned his spelling
between '49 and--and '54.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.778
He got a PhD between,
you know, '67 and '72.

22:42.779 --> 22:45.947
So we're looking at someone
who's minimum of 50 years old.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.367
Plus, if he's got an affiliation
with the Black Panthers,

22:48.368 --> 22:49.993
then he wouldn't use
the word "Negro."

22:49.994 --> 22:52.372
So it's not him.
It's not Leo Burt.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.378
I'm gonna take "college,"
and I'm gonna take "Chicago."

22:59.379 --> 23:01.338
- And I'm gonna forget the rest.
- Perfect.

23:01.339 --> 23:02.589
You can't do that.
You can't pick and choose.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.176
He's over 50.
That's three robust data points.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.344
Plus, the Unabomber got a doctorate.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.012
He didn't just spend
a little time in college.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.514
He got a PhD.
No, you can't do that!

23:10.515 --> 23:12.600
Okay!
This meeting's over!

23:14.519 --> 23:15.895
That's it.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.108
What's this based on?

23:20.274 --> 23:23.110
The Unabomber's idiolect,
his use of language,

23:23.111 --> 23:25.529
- the formatting, his spelling.
- The spelling?

23:25.530 --> 23:28.031
Goddamn spelling?
I'm gonna kill this guy.

23:28.032 --> 23:31.576
Every serial bomber in history
started between 18 and 21.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.413
That puts his age
between 35 and 45.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.081
Well, maybe he's
the exception to the rule.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.374
Every profiler that
we've had in here, including--

23:37.375 --> 23:38.918
Go back to your desks,
both of you!

23:39.627 --> 23:41.087
If you want a seat at this table,

23:41.421 --> 23:44.132
you put names on that board!
That's your job!

23:44.382 --> 23:47.050
Your job is not to tell me
to burn a month's work

23:47.051 --> 23:48.553
over goddamn spelling!

23:58.354 --> 23:59.729
What the hell is wrong with you?

23:59.730 --> 24:01.232
They're just so blinded,
they can't see.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.150
They're blinded?
Dude, you just turned a promotion

24:03.151 --> 24:04.234
into a freaking kamikaze mission.

24:04.235 --> 24:05.694
No, no, no.
I just saved the investigation.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.280
That's what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to save it.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.281
You know, they can run
the MPP all month long,

24:09.282 --> 24:10.699
but garbage in,
garbage out.

24:10.700 --> 24:11.783
They got 2,000 subjects.
They're all wrong.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.034
Well, how can you be so sure
they're wrong?

24:13.035 --> 24:14.119
We don't even know
what we're doing.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.329
We're making this up as we go.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.330
Yeah, yeah.
We're breaking new ground.

24:17.331 --> 24:18.707
- Maybe.
- It's great.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.751
Maybe we're wrong.
I mean, look at us.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.378
I mean, I'm flunking out
of Intro to Psych.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.213
You have a night school degree
in an unrelated field.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.633
- Doesn't mean that...
- We don't even know what we don't know.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.137
I know that we're right.

24:31.846 --> 24:34.014
Okay. You want to stake
your career on that?

24:34.015 --> 24:36.184
You go ahead.
You leave me the hell out of it.

24:43.316 --> 24:44.316
Seriously?

24:44.317 --> 24:45.359
They're sending me back to the lab.

24:46.819 --> 24:47.695
It's been real.

25:00.875 --> 25:01.959
<i>Hello?</i>

25:02.793 --> 25:03.920
Thanks for staying up.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.338
<i>Rough day, huh?</i>

25:06.339 --> 25:08.049
Yeah.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.803
There is a silver lining.

25:14.055 --> 25:16.848
Yeah. I, uh--I found
a dictionary of phrases,

25:16.849 --> 25:18.350
and I've been reading about

25:18.351 --> 25:19.519
"eat your cake and have it, too."

25:20.520 --> 25:22.729
Have your cake and eat it, too.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.525
<i>Yeah. See, that's the thing.
It is actually the other way around.</i>

25:26.067 --> 25:28.193
Sometime in the 1500s,
it got switched around.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.444
And we've been saying it wrong
ever since.

25:30.446 --> 25:31.822
<i>Oh, wow. Yeah.</i>

25:32.782 --> 25:34.242
<i>So, why are you telling me this?</i>

25:37.078 --> 25:38.120
How was today?

25:38.955 --> 25:41.623
<i>Doughnuts for Dad.</i>

25:41.624 --> 25:43.751
<i>Dan burned his tongue.
Sean opted out.</i>

25:46.045 --> 25:48.797
- And you?
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

25:48.798 --> 25:51.551
<i>I went. I stayed. I left.</i>

25:53.261 --> 25:54.554
All right.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.098
<i>Well, I love you.</i>

25:58.766 --> 26:00.101
I love you.

26:17.368 --> 26:20.162
To eating your cake
and having it, too, in that order.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.168
There's something so tragic
about him, isn't there?

26:27.295 --> 26:29.547
A guy who could write like that,
think like that,

26:30.006 --> 26:32.257
so much insight and passion?

26:32.258 --> 26:34.593
And yet, somehow,
his life turned out in such a way

26:34.594 --> 26:36.261
that he thinks
the only way he can get people

26:36.262 --> 26:38.681
to hear what he has to say
is by blowing people up?

26:39.015 --> 26:42.934
Well, if he was trapped,
ignored, powerless...

26:42.935 --> 26:45.353
He thinks
it's about being powerless,

26:45.354 --> 26:48.523
but, really, it's about being
so terribly lonely.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.358
It's about having just one person

26:50.359 --> 26:52.444
that he can talk to
who understands him,

26:52.445 --> 26:53.779
who respects him for who he is.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.074
That's what anyone wants, right?

27:00.828 --> 27:02.121
- There you go.
- Thanks.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.000
This is the Venn diagram
of nachos?

27:08.377 --> 27:11.212
You have the jalapeño zone
to the North,

27:11.213 --> 27:14.215
the bean zone to the West,
salsa zone to the East,

27:14.216 --> 27:16.509
and at the center,
it's the Pripyat River Valley.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.223
It's just some linguistics humor--

27:21.474 --> 27:22.808
you know, the Slavic homeland.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.853
- Huh?
- Never mind.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.396
You know, it's just
this weird, dorky thing.

27:28.397 --> 27:31.359
Go on.
Go on. Tell me.

27:33.194 --> 27:34.111
Okay.

27:34.612 --> 27:38.823
So, around the year 600,

27:38.824 --> 27:41.452
Slavic people suddenly
appeared all over Europe--

27:41.744 --> 27:43.912
you know, Germany, Poland,
Serbia, Russia--

27:43.913 --> 27:45.289
but nobody could figure out
where they came from.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.415
- The Slavic homeland.
- Right.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.292
It was this huge
historical mystery

27:49.293 --> 27:51.962
until they started
looking at language,

27:52.546 --> 27:55.173
and they realized that Proto-Slavic

27:55.174 --> 27:57.592
was missing words
for certain kinds of trees.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.177
You know,
they had to borrow words

27:59.178 --> 28:02.765
for oak and beech
and pine and...

28:08.062 --> 28:09.938
The nachos are Europe.

28:09.939 --> 28:11.690
The Slavs are everywhere,

28:11.691 --> 28:13.109
but they don't have
a word for jalapeños.

28:14.151 --> 28:15.652
So they can't come from here?

28:15.653 --> 28:16.569
Exactly.

28:16.570 --> 28:20.073
And they have no word for beans
or salsa or sour cream,

28:20.074 --> 28:23.244
which eliminates
everywhere but here.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.829
The Pripyat River Valley
in the Ukraine.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.539
It's basically this huge swamp--

28:27.540 --> 28:29.542
the one place in Europe
where there are no trees.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.292
Right.

28:31.293 --> 28:33.421
It was brilliant
because, up until then,

28:33.796 --> 28:35.506
they had only been looking at
the words that they had,

28:35.881 --> 28:38.300
and the key was in the words
that they didn't have.

28:38.634 --> 28:40.427
- What they didn't say.
- Mm-hmm.

28:40.428 --> 28:41.637
What they didn't know how to say.

28:45.141 --> 28:46.434
What they didn't know how to say.

28:48.602 --> 28:49.645
Right.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.982
- Go.
- It's the Slavic homeland.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.317
- Go.
- Thank you.

28:55.484 --> 28:56.736
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

29:14.962 --> 29:16.756
So what don't you talk about?

29:22.720 --> 29:26.682
Wife, children, family--
you don't talk about them.

29:31.562 --> 29:32.897
Work?

29:33.230 --> 29:35.316
Don't talk about a job,
coworkers.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.486
Friends--
you don't have any friends.

29:38.903 --> 29:41.030
You got no one to talk to,
no one to listen to.

29:42.865 --> 29:46.285
And no computer, TVs,

29:47.161 --> 29:48.204
no pop culture.

29:49.872 --> 29:53.209
So, no IBM, G.E., G.M.,
Xerox, Dell--

29:54.293 --> 29:56.212
you haven't heard of any of them.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.091
You're cut off.

30:05.471 --> 30:09.725
No black people, no women.

30:12.812 --> 30:15.438
You have a phone.
Call Nathan R.

30:15.439 --> 30:16.816
You wrote, "Call Nathan R."

30:21.278 --> 30:22.196
<i>You are out there.</i>

30:24.698 --> 30:26.325
<i>You're somewhere beyond.</i>

30:30.996 --> 30:32.540
<i>Isolated.</i>

30:35.876 --> 30:37.294
This is it.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.465
This is your homeland here...

30:43.676 --> 30:47.471
where there's nobody,
where there's nothing.

31:09.493 --> 31:10.411
Well, this is nice.

31:11.537 --> 31:12.788
You don't change, do you, Fitz?

31:13.998 --> 31:15.416
Just a little less subtle this time.

31:16.667 --> 31:17.751
Ted set me up...

31:18.878 --> 31:21.170
so he could attack the search warrant,

31:21.171 --> 31:23.423
attack my forensic linguistics work.

31:23.424 --> 31:25.885
So what? Your work is solid,
and it worked.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.303
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter

31:28.304 --> 31:29.637
'cause they're gonna
put me on the stand.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.057
They're gonna tear me apart
'cause I don't have a PhD.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.350
I'm not gonna be humiliated
in front of the whole Bureau.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.644
Stop with the self-pity.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.397
Who cares what the Bureau thinks?

31:39.982 --> 31:41.150
They don't care about you

31:41.400 --> 31:42.943
unless they want something from you.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.905
What we had, what we discovered,

31:46.906 --> 31:48.532
the work, at least...

31:50.159 --> 31:53.287
was special, and it was right.

31:54.371 --> 31:57.041
You are more than this case, Fitz,

31:59.460 --> 32:00.878
even if you don't believe it,

32:02.546 --> 32:04.256
even if they never give you credit for it.

32:05.549 --> 32:07.343
That has to mean something, right?

32:09.887 --> 32:10.888
What was that about credit?

32:12.681 --> 32:15.642
Credit--that is the way back in.
Ted wants to be famous.

32:15.643 --> 32:18.061
He wants everyone to know
how smart he is.

32:18.062 --> 32:20.105
The only way he's gonna get
the credit is to plead guilty.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.567
You bet the farm once before
that he'd need a trophy.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.235
- This is different.
- Look how that turned out.

32:26.236 --> 32:27.904
This is different.
You know that.

32:27.905 --> 32:29.530
You can convince me all night,

32:29.531 --> 32:31.241
but there's no way
Cole will let you in there.

32:34.787 --> 32:35.621
I'll go on my own.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.207
Make the call. I'll go tonight.

32:39.083 --> 32:41.251
It'll be off the record,
just me and Ted, face-to-face.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.628
I'll make--
I'll make it right.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.005
You make the call.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.008
Make the call.

33:02.356 --> 33:03.273
I'm off the case.

33:04.608 --> 33:05.651
I'm going home.

33:06.694 --> 33:09.154
I thought it best
if you heard it from me.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.367
There's one thing I would like
to ask you before I leave.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.961
Did you do all this because you wanted
to make a difference in the world,

33:24.128 --> 33:25.212
to change things?

33:26.088 --> 33:27.548
That's what I admired about you.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.801
You know, I admired you so much,

33:31.176 --> 33:34.471
I gave up everything
to live like you--

33:35.305 --> 33:37.599
alone in the woods,
manifesto under my bed.

33:39.268 --> 33:40.436
Is that true?

33:44.148 --> 33:45.649
When you asked for me,
I came, right?

33:47.151 --> 33:48.527
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

33:49.528 --> 33:51.864
Not many men whose ideas
can change the world.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.908
Now you're gonna throw it all away.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.203
I'm not throwing anything away.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.706
I'm beating the system at its own game.

34:01.707 --> 34:02.790
That's the whole point.

34:02.791 --> 34:05.668
Well, getting the search warrant
tossed out is beating the system.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.171
But what about after?

34:08.464 --> 34:10.006
Oh, you mean after.

34:10.007 --> 34:13.302
Well, I--I walk away a free man,

34:14.178 --> 34:18.766
vindicated as the victim of your sloppy
and inexpert police work.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.268
Aren't you forgetting a step?

34:21.727 --> 34:23.144
Before you walk free,

34:23.145 --> 34:25.313
you gotta stand
in front of a judge and say,

34:25.314 --> 34:26.398
"I'm not guilty.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.444
"I'm not the Unabomber.
I didn't write the manifesto,

34:30.778 --> 34:33.488
"didn't elude the FBI
for two decades.

34:33.489 --> 34:36.784
I'm just a nobody
who stands for nothing."

34:36.950 --> 34:39.202
No.

34:39.203 --> 34:42.955
See, your--your logic is flawed.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.124
I'm gonna be acquitted
on a technicality,

34:45.125 --> 34:46.585
not on the merits of the case.

34:47.211 --> 34:50.922
I won't be saying
that I'm not the Unabomber.

34:50.923 --> 34:54.342
You say that on TV,
then people who admire you, like me,

34:54.343 --> 34:55.761
are just gonna think
you're a hypocrite.

34:56.637 --> 34:59.055
You're just betraying your own principles
to save your own skin.

34:59.056 --> 35:00.224
No, you gotta stand up.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.934
You got to take ownership
of what you wrote.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.228
Otherwise, your legacy,
the manifesto will vanish.

35:05.229 --> 35:06.771
The manifesto will not vanish

35:06.772 --> 35:08.815
because the manifesto
has been published,

35:08.816 --> 35:11.819
and more importantly,
the manifesto happens to be right.

35:12.236 --> 35:13.653
Doesn't matter if it's right.

35:13.654 --> 35:14.904
People don't believe in you,

35:14.905 --> 35:16.365
they won't believe in the manifesto.

35:16.907 --> 35:19.952
Are you, one man, doing it all alone,

35:20.828 --> 35:22.745
or are you a leader of men,

35:22.746 --> 35:25.039
a man who can change the world,

35:25.040 --> 35:27.835
who can make a difference
and can leave a legacy behind?

35:28.335 --> 35:29.837
Because you can't be both.

35:32.089 --> 35:34.007
Can't eat your cake
and have it, too, Ted.

35:37.427 --> 35:38.595
What about you, Fitz?

35:39.972 --> 35:41.598
What's your legacy?

35:42.516 --> 35:43.851
What are you leaving behind?

35:45.978 --> 35:49.857
My family, my sons,
they're my legacy.

35:50.023 --> 35:52.191
So they were out
in the woods with you?

35:52.192 --> 35:54.443
- Mm-mm. No. They weren't.
- No. They weren't.

35:54.444 --> 35:55.903
So why do you think you said that?

35:55.904 --> 35:57.613
Why do you think you're lying to me?

35:57.614 --> 35:58.781
I wasn't lying.
It's complicated.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.908
It's not complicated.
It's simple.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.744
They're not your legacy. I am.

36:04.454 --> 36:05.663
You're not my legacy.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.290
You're here because catching me

36:07.291 --> 36:09.542
is the only meaningful thing
you've ever accomplished.

36:09.543 --> 36:11.794
And now I'm gonna walk,
you can feel it slipping away.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.213
If you walk,
you will lose all respect.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.800
Are you talking about me or you?

36:19.178 --> 36:22.597
Because, see, it's you
that spent your whole life

36:22.598 --> 36:24.640
desperate for respect,
desperate to prove

36:24.641 --> 36:26.225
that you're smarter
than the people around you,

36:26.226 --> 36:27.810
and for a brief moment,
you were.

36:27.811 --> 36:29.271
You were the guy
that caught the Unabomber.

36:30.355 --> 36:33.149
But I'm about to walk,
and the whole world will see

36:33.150 --> 36:35.693
that you are just
a knuckle-dragging beat cop,

36:35.694 --> 36:37.696
and the graffiti squad
was where you belonged.

36:38.280 --> 36:42.242
You know, the thing I find
most sad about you, James,

36:42.409 --> 36:45.161
is that you can run off
and live in the woods,

36:45.162 --> 36:46.996
abandoning your wife and kids,

36:46.997 --> 36:49.582
study the manifesto down to the letter,

36:49.583 --> 36:52.753
but it will not make one jot
of difference to anyone,

36:54.004 --> 36:55.964
and the best that you will ever be

36:57.633 --> 36:59.843
is a feeble imitation of me.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.266
I've got some concerns
about Leo Burt.

37:47.474 --> 37:49.851
He's our best suspect,
but he's also our most elusive.

37:52.104 --> 37:54.314
Uh, Fitz, uh, you weren't
on the list for this meeting,

37:54.648 --> 37:57.191
so if we need you,
we will give you a buzz.

37:57.192 --> 38:00.152
This is a new profile.
It's clean, no typos, solid.

38:00.153 --> 38:01.488
Goodbye, Fitz.

38:04.283 --> 38:05.242
Just trying to help.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.911
This is based on what exactly?

38:08.120 --> 38:10.329
Forensics.
It's grounded in forensics.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.040
- Forensics?
- I've come up with an approach

38:12.332 --> 38:14.166
I'm calling forensic linguistics.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.751
Fingerprints are forensics.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.753
DNA is forensics.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.256
Spelling "wilfully" with one L
is not forensics.

38:20.257 --> 38:22.758
It's not just spelling.
It's a comprehensive idiolectic profile--

38:22.759 --> 38:25.679
Fitz, we don't want a profile.
We want a person.

38:26.847 --> 38:28.682
Can you get us a person
that we can put on the board?

38:29.391 --> 38:31.476
- I think if you just read it...
- I didn't think so.

38:32.019 --> 38:34.813
Give me a name
that I can put on the board.

38:35.772 --> 38:38.150
Otherwise, shut the door behind you.

38:48.618 --> 38:49.703
Toss that thing.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.709
Okay. Where were we?

38:56.710 --> 38:59.171
We've got the top five,
counting Leo Burt.

39:12.601 --> 39:14.144
Fitz, thinking:
<i>Look at this obedient sheep.</i>

39:14.519 --> 39:16.772
<i>Gotta make them hear you.
Gotta make them listen.</i>

39:37.709 --> 39:40.921
You're gonna make them listen.
You're gonna make them hear you.

39:45.884 --> 39:46.843
How?

39:47.928 --> 39:49.303
How?

39:52.641 --> 39:54.309
- Who's my liaison?
- Over here.

39:57.938 --> 39:59.271
Tell the lab to drop
everything else.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.648
This is all hands on deck.

40:00.649 --> 40:01.900
Copy that. We're on it.

40:02.192 --> 40:03.734
Get the originals down to forensics.

40:03.735 --> 40:04.985
Follow me.

40:17.707 --> 40:19.918
They're from him.
They're all from him.

40:38.270 --> 40:39.896
Jesus, I'm gonna go get him.

40:50.991 --> 40:53.784
Why didn't you answer my pages?
You gotta come in.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.037
We just got a bunch of
new Unabom letters.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.249
He's written to <i>The Times,
The Washington Post, Penthouse.</i>

41:00.709 --> 41:01.877
You're not gonna believe this.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.337
The Unabomber wants to make a deal.

41:21.396 --> 41:24.566
Well, what the hell do we do now?
