00:02.333 --> 00:03.933
(male announcer)
Next is a Bravo scripted
original series.

00:03.967 --> 00:06.367
[drill whirring]

00:06.400 --> 00:08.233
You have a cavity
and we should

00:08.267 --> 00:09.533
take care of it
if you've got time.

00:09.567 --> 00:11.367
After the night I just had
you could tell me

00:11.400 --> 00:13.200
I needed a root canal
and I wouldn't complain.

00:14.467 --> 00:16.933
You know how hard it is
to find a mom friend

00:16.967 --> 00:19.267
that you actually like
and want to hang out with?

00:19.300 --> 00:21.767
I had an easier time
finding a husband.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.467
[sighs]
Sorry, I'm trying to put it

00:23.500 --> 00:26.000
behind me,
but I think I have PTSD.

00:26.033 --> 00:27.367
This is gonna pinch.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.533
The irony is that
it started out fine,

00:29.567 --> 00:30.700
great even.

00:30.733 --> 00:32.600
That's what
makes it so tragic.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.100
Ahh.

00:35.133 --> 00:37.800
* Hey, yes, you know

00:37.833 --> 00:40.533
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

00:41.967 --> 00:44.467
So, just to double check,
the party's over at 1 p.m.?

00:44.500 --> 00:45.633
(woman) That's right.
- Rima.

00:46.767 --> 00:48.267
We have to stop
meeting like this.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.100
We must be on
the same party circuit.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.967
Except this time
we can actually leave

00:52.000 --> 00:53.067
the "drop-off party."

00:53.100 --> 00:55.033
- Hallelujah.
[both laugh]

00:55.067 --> 00:56.033
Okay, I have to ask

00:56.067 --> 00:58.367
why does your voice
sound so familiar?

00:58.400 --> 01:01.967
"This is Rima Chiquri-Portman,
National Public Radio."

01:02.067 --> 01:04.633
I knew it!
I was like, in love

01:04.667 --> 01:06.500
with your reporting
on the drought in Ethiopia.

01:06.533 --> 01:09.067
I mean, as much
as you can be in love

01:09.067 --> 01:10.433
with something so tragic.

01:10.467 --> 01:12.633
- Thank you.
- Well, would you ever want

01:12.667 --> 01:14.200
to, like, get coffee
sometime?

01:14.233 --> 01:15.767
Oh, how about dinner?

01:15.800 --> 01:17.367
Too forward?

01:17.400 --> 01:19.467
No, radical!
Love.

01:21.067 --> 01:23.367
[gasps]
A fellow cavewoman.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.800
We have to do this now.

01:24.833 --> 01:27.167
How about next Wednesday?

01:27.200 --> 01:28.533
Should we try that new
Japanese place

01:28.567 --> 01:31.533
- everyone's jizzing about?
- On 68th? Totally.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.833
- With husbands?
- It's a date!

01:33.867 --> 01:35.600
(Andy)
I thought you hate NPs.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.300
I don't hate
all new people.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.200
You're always telling me
to find my peeps

01:39.233 --> 01:41.300
in the hood and I think
I found one.

01:41.333 --> 01:42.833
Rima is my peeps.

01:42.867 --> 01:45.267
Okay, and I can feel
my penis shrinking

01:45.300 --> 01:47.667
as I say this, honey,
but I thought it was gonna be

01:47.700 --> 01:49.567
- our date night.
- It is.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.900
Only with more interesting
guest stars.

01:51.933 --> 01:54.833
Rima's been all over
the world for NPR.

01:54.867 --> 01:55.833
Now what about the husband?

01:55.867 --> 01:58.100
What does--
what does he do?

01:58.133 --> 02:00.500
I don't know.
Something in finance.

02:00.533 --> 02:03.400
Hon, we've been over this.
Finance is a broad field.

02:03.433 --> 02:04.933
Is he a hedge fund
millionaire

02:04.967 --> 02:07.100
or does he fix
ATM machines?

02:07.133 --> 02:09.933
Look, all I know is that
we could use a fun night out.

02:09.967 --> 02:12.500
And go easy on the sake.
We have to have sex later.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.300
Have to? Wait,
don't tell me we're trying

02:14.333 --> 02:16.567
- to get pregnant again.
- Ew, no.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.100
I'm just saying
it's been 18 days

02:18.133 --> 02:20.900
and we both know after 19
it starts to get weird.

02:20.933 --> 02:22.900
Well, we are not gonna
let it get to 19.

02:22.933 --> 02:24.067
Okay, chop, chop.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.533
I've been saving
my appetite all day.

02:25.567 --> 02:27.433
(Vanessa)
Honeys, I'm home!

02:27.467 --> 02:29.067
Come in, we're naked!

02:29.067 --> 02:31.667
[gasps]
Love this.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.067
Where are the littles?

02:33.067 --> 02:34.667
Oh, Ashley's bringing them
back any minute.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.500
They were at the park
and she got a callback

02:36.533 --> 02:39.733
to play a patient who was raped
by her dermatologist on SVU.

02:39.767 --> 02:42.500
Thank you for covering.
You'll be okay?

02:42.533 --> 02:43.600
(Andy)
Yeah, they're impossible.

02:43.633 --> 02:44.967
Guys,
it's not that complicated.

02:45.067 --> 02:47.100
I'm an ER doctor.
I deal with kids every day.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.233
Now, go forth,
make a mom-friend

02:49.267 --> 02:50.400
you don't hate.

02:50.433 --> 02:52.433
- Love.
- Love you.

02:52.467 --> 02:53.867
Thank you.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.833
Whoa-ho!

02:55.867 --> 02:57.700
Taxi!

02:57.733 --> 02:58.700
[beeps]

02:58.733 --> 03:01.767
[upbeat music playing]

03:01.800 --> 03:06.300
*

03:06.333 --> 03:08.067
Hi, it's under
"Weber."

03:08.100 --> 03:10.333
Our friends are, like,
two minutes away.

03:10.367 --> 03:13.433
- Jill, hi.
- Hi!

03:13.467 --> 03:16.467
Nice to meet you.
This is my husband, Joffrey.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.967
Enchanté.
God,

03:19.067 --> 03:21.333
I love your whole look.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.200
It's like Marc Jacobs had
a threesome

03:23.233 --> 03:25.200
with Morticia Addams
and Karl Lagerfeld's

03:25.233 --> 03:28.600
- androgynous younger sister.
- Wow. Thank you.

03:28.633 --> 03:30.067
Welcome to Shiawase.

03:30.100 --> 03:31.933
It is Japanese word
for happiness.

03:31.967 --> 03:34.967
- Please follow the me.
- Oh, sure.

03:35.067 --> 03:37.067
I'm sorry, but is he...

03:37.100 --> 03:38.567
They're perfect!

03:38.600 --> 03:40.433
It's like a BFF
and a gay best friend

03:40.467 --> 03:43.367
rolled up in one couple.
Don't eff this up.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.900
I thought von Weber
was party of six.

03:45.933 --> 03:48.133
No, we're the von-less
Webers.

03:48.167 --> 03:49.733
[laughter]
- Oh, my God.

03:49.767 --> 03:51.500
- Andy!
- Dude!

03:51.533 --> 03:52.633
- Hi!
- Crazy!

03:52.667 --> 03:54.133
This isn't happening.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.133
[speaking Japanese]

04:01.567 --> 04:02.900
What is she saying?

04:02.933 --> 04:06.067
[speaks Japanese]

04:06.067 --> 04:07.333
Right this way.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.500
No. You--
this can not happen.

04:10.533 --> 04:11.700
You know I hate
group dinners.

04:11.733 --> 04:13.067
(Lex)
Ah, this is great.

04:13.067 --> 04:14.467
What am I supposed to do?

04:14.500 --> 04:17.067
I don't know.
Pull the fire alarm.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.533
Light yourself on fire.
Something with fire.

04:19.567 --> 04:22.133
Everybody have a seat.
Girls on this end,

04:22.167 --> 04:23.400
boys on that end.

04:23.433 --> 04:24.933
Honey, look, I know
it's not ideal,

04:24.967 --> 04:26.333
but please try and go
with the flow

04:26.367 --> 04:27.867
and try and have
a good time for me.

04:27.900 --> 04:31.267
[groans] Fine.
Totes. I'm just hungry.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.967
- Lex. How you doing? Hey.
- Hey.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.967
[Lex grunts]
Hey.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.200
- Jilly beans. You look pretty.
- I'm just with my friend.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.933
(Lex)
Come on, sit down.
Sit down.

04:38.967 --> 04:39.967
Tell me everything.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.867
- Hang with the boys tonight.
- Rima.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.167
You're one of the bros,
am I right?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.333
I'm Brooke.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.500
- Uh, Brooke?
- Yeah.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.433
Ew, stop it.

04:49.467 --> 04:51.067
Hey, guys, cut it out.

04:51.067 --> 04:53.967
Seriously. There are kids
in some parts of Africa

04:54.067 --> 04:55.833
who would slurp that noodle
off their dirt floor.

04:55.867 --> 04:58.833
- Why is their floor dirt?
- And why are they so hungry?

04:58.867 --> 05:01.700
Uh...

05:01.733 --> 05:03.800
those are really
good questions, guys.

05:03.833 --> 05:06.100
I guess the main reasons

05:06.133 --> 05:08.067
are lack of infrastructure,

05:08.067 --> 05:10.200
famine, disease...

05:10.233 --> 05:13.600
- and war.
- Why do they have a war?

05:13.633 --> 05:15.400
Hmm. Let's back it up.

05:15.433 --> 05:16.567
Have your folks
talked to you at all

05:16.600 --> 05:19.200
- about ethnic tensions?
- Uh-uh.

05:19.233 --> 05:22.567
[Japanese music playing]
- Thank you.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.633
So, uh, Jared,
what do you do?

05:24.667 --> 05:26.533
Uh, I short currencies.
Ooh!

05:26.567 --> 05:30.300
Yeah! We're getting
insta updates off ESPN.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.067
You do it, Hernandez!

05:32.067 --> 05:33.967
- It's awesome.
(Brooke) [laughs]

05:34.067 --> 05:36.967
So where did you
learn Japanese?

05:37.067 --> 05:40.533
Well, I skied on the
U.S. Slalom team at Nagano,

05:40.567 --> 05:42.733
so I think of
all the Japanese

05:42.767 --> 05:44.800
- as my "fa-mu-rii."
- [laughs]

05:44.833 --> 05:47.700
- It means family.
- Wow, you were an Olympian?

05:47.733 --> 05:49.133
- That's amazing.
- I know.

05:49.167 --> 05:50.900
Hi, can we get
some menus, please?

05:50.933 --> 05:53.300
Not being a diva,
I'm just a minute away from

05:53.333 --> 05:55.767
taking a bite out of
your beautiful child-face.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.633
Stunning.
I'm hypnotized.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.600
You're so sweet.

06:02.633 --> 06:05.100
And I love your scarf.

06:05.133 --> 06:07.700
Is that from the looms of
the Rajasthani weaver's guild?

06:07.733 --> 06:09.967
I did a story on them.
How did you--

06:10.067 --> 06:11.600
I was literally just
emailing with Devadas--

06:11.633 --> 06:14.067
Oh, my God.
Hi, Danielle. Over here.

06:14.067 --> 06:15.867
Brooke, look who it is.

06:17.833 --> 06:19.833
Jill, let's not
make a scene.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.533
What do you mean?
She's your peeps.

06:22.567 --> 06:25.767
Not since her husband
got nabbed for insider trading.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.767
Wait, so her husband
went to jail

06:27.800 --> 06:29.367
so you stop
talking to her?

06:29.400 --> 06:32.067
Brooke can't be around all
that drama while she's pregnant.

06:32.067 --> 06:35.333
Ten years.
Orange is the new bye-bye.

06:37.333 --> 06:40.067
Oh, nope, we don't need
menus, we're not tourists.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.200
We're doing...

06:42.233 --> 06:44.600
Omakase.

06:44.633 --> 06:46.167
[gong crashes]

06:46.200 --> 06:48.133
Chef selection menu.

06:48.167 --> 06:51.467
We have silver lotus level
and gold dragon level.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.500
Or laughing Buddha level.

06:54.533 --> 06:56.867
11 courses.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.900
So special.
Even price is a mystery.

07:00.067 --> 07:01.267
- [woman gasps]
- Done.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.900
Ten laughing Buddhas.

07:02.933 --> 07:05.600
Make that nine
laughing Buddhas.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.700
Sorry, I'll just have
the creamy, spicy shrimp.

07:07.733 --> 07:12.267
Uh, Omakase menu must be
everyone together

07:12.300 --> 07:15.433
or no one can enjoy.

07:15.467 --> 07:19.333
- Is there like a three course?
- No, 11 courses all around.

07:19.367 --> 07:21.067
We're gonna be here
all night.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.600
And, uh, six bottles
of your best sake.

07:23.633 --> 07:24.767
[cheering]

07:24.800 --> 07:26.367
(waitress)
Thank you for your trust.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.400
While we prepare,
please enjoy

07:28.433 --> 07:30.700
Japanese lute
performance.

07:40.733 --> 07:42.567
You're never at
the good end of the table,

07:42.600 --> 07:44.267
you're paying
a bajillion dollars

07:44.300 --> 07:47.367
to subsidize
other people's alcoholism,

07:47.400 --> 07:49.733
and it goes on
forevskis and a day.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.833
- Am I right?
- Open wide.

07:51.867 --> 07:53.067
[drill whirring]

07:54.333 --> 07:58.633
First course is fresh
Daikon leaf with sea salt.

Ooh.

We have to get
together sometime.

08:08.133 --> 08:09.900
Just saying hi.

08:09.933 --> 08:12.067
Isn't this ridic?
[scoffs]

08:12.067 --> 08:13.833
I mean, really,
they probably just picked that

08:13.867 --> 08:14.867
out of the planter
in the corner

08:14.900 --> 08:16.300
and shoved it
on a plate.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.067
Jill, just try it.
It's delicious.

08:19.067 --> 08:23.067
- It's so fresh.
- Oh... kay.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.400
(Waitress)
Next course trio of edamame.

08:25.433 --> 08:27.533
Pearls of wisdom.

08:27.567 --> 08:31.133
Fourth course,
bamboo-infused Udon noodle.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.433
Most auspicious noodle.

08:33.467 --> 08:35.300
[gong crashes]
(all) Ooh.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.733
(Jill)
You're so lonely.

08:42.633 --> 08:44.267
[Danielle crying]

08:44.300 --> 08:45.767
Jill?

08:45.800 --> 08:48.933
[muffled]
How did you know it was me?

08:48.967 --> 08:51.367
Your shoes sounded cheap.
[whimpering]

08:51.400 --> 08:53.267
Hey.

08:53.300 --> 08:57.100
I'm sorry about your husband,
and, you know, jail.

08:57.133 --> 08:59.767
Oh, okay.
It's a difficult time.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.233
- Let it out.
- Thank you for talking to me.

09:02.267 --> 09:03.967
Brooke won't
even look at me.

09:04.067 --> 09:07.333
Danielle,
you are a strong woman

09:07.367 --> 09:09.267
and--

09:09.300 --> 09:10.667
Do you happen to have
any snacks in your purse?

09:10.700 --> 09:13.067
My blood sugar
is base jumping right now.

09:13.067 --> 09:17.467
You think I'd carry
food in my handbag?

09:17.500 --> 09:19.133
What has happened
to my life?

09:19.167 --> 09:21.167
No, of course not.
You're still you.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.500
Okay.

09:22.533 --> 09:25.533
Just--just without your
husband or your friends.

09:25.567 --> 09:27.067
[crying]

09:27.100 --> 09:30.367
Look, I have to go back,
but if you need anything,

09:30.400 --> 09:34.133
I am here, you know,
in spirit. Okay?

09:34.167 --> 09:35.133
All right.

09:35.167 --> 09:37.733
Awesome rocky rolls.

09:37.767 --> 09:41.433
Carbs!
* Hallelujah

09:41.467 --> 09:44.167
- Where's mine?
- It was delicious.

09:44.200 --> 09:48.700
- Like a pussy made out of rice.
- [laughter]

09:48.733 --> 09:52.467
Jilly beans, you gotta listen
to Sebastian's story.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.867
I just banged
this epileptic chick.

09:54.900 --> 09:57.433
I made her c*á so hard
she had a seizure.

09:57.467 --> 10:00.667
In bed she was like...
[groaning]

10:00.700 --> 10:03.333
[laughter]

10:03.367 --> 10:04.867
Wait, excuse me,
aren't you married?

10:04.900 --> 10:07.767
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, he's deaf.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.367
- So?
- Anyway, I'd go with your wife.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.367
I think about it
all the time.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.267
What are you guys
talking about?

10:15.300 --> 10:16.633
Who at the table
we'd bone if our wives

10:16.667 --> 10:18.700
- gave us a freebie.
- I bet you she's a screamer.

10:18.733 --> 10:22.300
[Lex laughs]
- And I love fake tits.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.200
- Whoa!
- Dude, if you were anybody else

10:24.233 --> 10:26.467
I would pummel you,
but you're you,

10:26.500 --> 10:28.700
so it's hilarious.

10:28.733 --> 10:30.533
Hey, let's hear
the Jill version. Huh?

10:30.567 --> 10:32.000
Which one of us
would it be?

10:32.033 --> 10:33.533
For sh*á* and gigs.

10:33.567 --> 10:36.533
[funky music playing]

10:36.567 --> 10:42.267
*

10:42.300 --> 10:44.367
This is thick.

10:46.133 --> 10:47.833
I would take you all
up to my bedroom...

10:47.867 --> 10:49.700
- Oh!
- Oh, she's crazy!

10:49.733 --> 10:52.467
And then I'd roofie you,
roll you up in a duvet,

10:52.500 --> 10:55.733
and light it on fire.
Excuse me.

10:55.767 --> 10:58.300
Jilly beans.

10:58.333 --> 10:59.667
That's kinda dark.

11:00.733 --> 11:02.333
We are in hour three.

11:02.367 --> 11:03.900
Seriously, call the police.

11:03.933 --> 11:05.900
Tell them there's
a hostage situation.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.467
It isn't even really a lie.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.067
[groans]
Group dinners.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.833
It's like hell and purgatory
at the same time.

11:11.867 --> 11:13.567
Sometimes I think
you're the only person

11:13.600 --> 11:15.067
who really
understands me.

11:15.067 --> 11:17.733
I'm definitely the only person
who understands you.

11:17.767 --> 11:19.100
- How many people?
- Ten!

11:19.133 --> 11:21.100
And my mom-friend
thinks I'm cellophane

11:21.133 --> 11:23.067
and Brooke is turning on
her tractor beam,

11:23.067 --> 11:24.500
and acting all smart.

11:24.533 --> 11:27.067
Listen, you have a tractor beam.
You're smart.

11:27.067 --> 11:28.400
You had the date
with the mom-friend.

11:28.433 --> 11:29.600
I say fight back.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.867
Thanks, I think I will.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.300
Love you. Bye.

11:35.533 --> 11:37.100
So, where were we?

11:37.133 --> 11:39.067
(all)
AIDS.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.067
[funky music playing]

11:42.100 --> 11:46.600
*

11:46.633 --> 11:48.433
Do you mind
if I take this?

11:48.467 --> 11:52.067
- Thanks.
[Brooke laughs]

11:52.100 --> 11:53.533
Jill, what are you doing?

11:53.567 --> 11:55.733
- Just joining the party.
- There's no place setting.

11:55.767 --> 11:58.133
Oh, it's okay.

11:58.167 --> 12:00.567
- So where were we?
- I was just telling Rima

12:00.600 --> 12:02.400
how, ever since the sale,

12:02.433 --> 12:04.100
I've felt I needed a bigger

12:04.133 --> 12:06.333
philanthropic canvas,
so to speak.

12:06.367 --> 12:08.133
If you are as fortunate
as we are,

12:08.167 --> 12:09.967
you have to constantly
be giving back

12:10.067 --> 12:11.300
or you start to look bad.

12:11.333 --> 12:13.600
So, I thought,

12:13.633 --> 12:15.800
"Who needs things?"

12:15.833 --> 12:17.833
Orphans in Africa.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.233
Well, what are you
going to focus on?

12:19.267 --> 12:20.533
I mean, there's just
so many issues.

12:20.567 --> 12:23.300
Totally.
Ebola, hunger.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.633
But then it hit me...

12:25.667 --> 12:28.200
Bouncy castles.

12:30.467 --> 12:32.600
Wait,
you're going to send

12:32.633 --> 12:35.767
bouncy castles to Africa?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.700
Did you ever consider,
I don't know,

12:37.733 --> 12:39.733
toilets or medicine?

12:39.767 --> 12:41.700
[laughs nervously]

12:41.733 --> 12:44.067
It may seem frivolous,

12:44.100 --> 12:46.233
but bouncy castles
are low-cost to ship

12:46.267 --> 12:47.833
and they don't require
any assembly.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.467
The way I see it,

12:49.500 --> 12:52.200
joy shouldn't be
a luxury item.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.967
I think it's original,
Brooke.

12:58.067 --> 13:01.833
You're giving these poor kids
a chance to just be kids.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.700
- You get it.
- I'm sorry, Rima,

13:04.733 --> 13:07.333
but when you were in "Nambia,"
did it really seem like

13:07.367 --> 13:10.167
the thing they needed the most
was bouncy castles?

13:10.200 --> 13:13.367
- Do you mean Namibia?
- "Nambia's" not a country.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.900
Oh, right,
I meant Zambia.

13:15.933 --> 13:17.567
Ah.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.967
[gong crashes]

13:19.067 --> 13:21.067
Seventh course
is holy water

13:21.067 --> 13:23.600
from mountains
of Nagano prefecture.

13:23.633 --> 13:26.500
[Brooke gasps]
Nagano!

[triumphant fanfare]

13:31.100 --> 13:32.800
Mmm.

13:32.833 --> 13:35.067
Tastes just how
I remember.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.600
Like victory.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.233
I mean, couldn't you
just barf?

13:44.267 --> 13:46.667
Rima's eating it up
and I'm sitting there

13:46.700 --> 13:49.667
starving my ass off
trapped in a douche canoe

13:49.700 --> 13:51.867
with a chopstick
for a paddle.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.500
[laughter]

13:54.767 --> 13:58.900
Eighth course is
whipped fermented fish paste.

(all)
Ooh.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.500
[gong crashes]

14:06.533 --> 14:09.600
Hon, I'm sorry, I tried,
I really tried,

14:09.633 --> 14:11.167
but here's my proposal.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.300
Popeye's, sex,
and Broad City.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.433
No! You can't take him
from me.

14:16.467 --> 14:18.467
No, ma'am.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.733
Come on, hon,
I don't want to leave.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.600
I'm having fun.

14:21.633 --> 14:24.067
Okay, you stay
and I'm gonna take

14:24.067 --> 14:25.533
my "hangry" ass home.

14:25.567 --> 14:27.733
You cannot miss
the sea urchin course.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.267
- Now sit your tiny ass down.
- [laughs]

14:30.300 --> 14:32.467
I forbid you to leave.

14:34.867 --> 14:36.233
[sighs]

14:36.267 --> 14:39.967
So, Jared,
what made you the, uh,

14:40.067 --> 14:42.300
unforgettable person
you are today?

14:42.333 --> 14:44.900
- Spare no details.
- I'm glad you asked.

14:44.933 --> 14:46.833
I was born
with acid reflux

14:46.867 --> 14:49.533
so I grew up in Scarsdale,
my mom's a piano teacher...

14:49.567 --> 14:52.100
...held off my circumcision...
I had to wear corrective shoes

14:52.133 --> 14:53.500
till my Bar Mitzvah...
Yeah, I was molested

14:53.533 --> 14:55.933
by my uncle
and my third grade teacher.

14:55.967 --> 14:57.933
And my track coach.
I think I must've just been

14:57.967 --> 14:59.800
a really beautiful kid.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.700
Final course.
Fragile egg shell.

15:02.733 --> 15:05.867
(all)
Ooh.

15:08.067 --> 15:10.600
Empty of substance
like life.

15:10.633 --> 15:13.767
It is whimsical Zen koan
of dessert.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.967
Thank you.
Good night.

15:23.867 --> 15:26.667
Honey, we should go.
Sitter, okay?

15:26.700 --> 15:27.867
Check please.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.200
- Six grand, yo.
[all groaning]

15:37.233 --> 15:39.067
Must have been
the sake.

Boom.

15:50.267 --> 15:51.933
Do the honors.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.067
Boom!

16:02.067 --> 16:06.233
- It's me.
[laughter]

16:06.267 --> 16:08.533
Yeah, it's nothing.
It's chump change.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.533
Okay, well,
this has been really great.

16:11.567 --> 16:13.933
What a coincidence,
we should buy a Lotto ticket

16:13.967 --> 16:16.433
on the way home.
Thank you.

16:16.467 --> 16:19.200
Okay. What--what happened
to your ring?

16:22.867 --> 16:25.867
[screams]
No!

16:29.467 --> 16:32.067
(Dottie)
But do you believe in God,
Aunt Vanessa?

16:32.067 --> 16:35.867
Um, I don't think
I do, actually.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.333
You know? I kind of see God
as a comforting,

16:38.367 --> 16:40.667
imaginary figure
that makes people feel better.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.867
Like Santa Claus
or the Tooth Fairy.

16:42.900 --> 16:46.233
The Tooth Fairy's
not real?

16:46.267 --> 16:48.967
Okay, one more topic
and then you're going to sleep.

16:49.067 --> 16:50.533
And this time,
I mean it.

16:50.567 --> 16:53.167
But, Aunt Vanessa,
if it's not God,

16:53.200 --> 16:54.933
then who
gives people AIDS?

16:54.967 --> 16:57.900
Hm, how many of you

16:57.933 --> 17:01.133
have heard the term,
"retrovirus"?

17:01.167 --> 17:04.100
- [Brooke crying]
- (Officer) Ma'am, calm down.

17:04.133 --> 17:06.200
Do you mind telling me
what happened?

17:06.233 --> 17:07.733
Ma'am, I understand
you're upset,

17:07.767 --> 17:09.367
but we can't perform
rectal searches

17:09.400 --> 17:10.500
without probable cause.

17:10.533 --> 17:13.367
- Find anything?
- Just a sticky Euro.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.100
I am so sorry
this was such a disaster.

17:16.133 --> 17:18.433
Are you kidding?
11 course meal,

17:18.467 --> 17:20.067
jewel heist,
this is the most fun

17:20.100 --> 17:22.300
I've had in a long time.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.333
I was always so intimidated
by your sister-in-law,

17:24.367 --> 17:25.800
but she's actually
quite warm.

17:25.833 --> 17:28.067
You've had dinner
with the Taliban

17:28.067 --> 17:29.900
and you're intimidated
by Brooke?

17:29.933 --> 17:32.367
Yeah, I mean,
she's just so...

17:32.400 --> 17:35.100
glamorous.
I could never be like that.

17:35.133 --> 17:37.533
Forget it.

17:37.567 --> 17:41.333
Let the record reflect
that I "went with the flow."

17:41.367 --> 17:42.967
You know who else
went with the flow?

17:43.067 --> 17:45.233
Leo DiCaprio in Titanic.

17:45.267 --> 17:47.067
Honey, what are you
gonna do?

17:47.067 --> 17:49.633
- She lost her rock.
- Does nothing bother you?

17:49.667 --> 17:51.833
We've been here
for seven hours!

17:51.867 --> 17:53.200
I actually had
a good time, hon.

17:53.233 --> 17:55.233
I mean, I'm sorry that you
got stuck at the bankers end

17:55.267 --> 17:57.900
of the table,
but what do you want from me?

17:57.933 --> 18:00.267
I just wish,
every once in a while,

18:00.300 --> 18:03.133
that people annoyed you
as much as they annoy me.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.700
Well, I'm annoyed
right now.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.267
Ya happy?

18:12.867 --> 18:14.067
[Danielle crying]

18:14.100 --> 18:15.867
Jesus,
you're still here?

18:15.900 --> 18:18.767
Jill?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.133
I just couldn't deal with
them all looking at me again

18:21.167 --> 18:22.667
when I walked out.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.233
- Danielle,
- What?

18:24.267 --> 18:26.067
Who cares what
a bunch of

18:26.100 --> 18:29.067
anorexic, pill-popping
hypocrites think?

18:29.067 --> 18:31.300
I mean, they let
this vile misogynist

18:31.333 --> 18:33.267
go on and on about
the other women

18:33.300 --> 18:35.133
he's banging
because he's deaf.

18:35.167 --> 18:37.567
And another one is
pretending her husband

18:37.600 --> 18:39.867
isn't sashaying down
Christopher Street

18:39.900 --> 18:43.967
- waving a rainbow flag.
[toilet flushes]

18:47.400 --> 18:48.800
Rima, hi.

18:48.833 --> 18:52.700
Wow, that was a lot.

18:52.733 --> 18:55.067
I'm sorry, it was
the low blood sugar talking.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.133
I barely ate anything
all day and the portions

18:57.167 --> 18:59.300
are like you need
a microscope to see them.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.400
Hey,
it's not my business.

19:01.433 --> 19:05.067
I'm just surprised that
you're harshing on everyone.

19:05.067 --> 19:08.067
You just seemed so nice.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.567
And you know what?
That was really offensive.

19:15.600 --> 19:19.333
That man is not gay,
he is deaf.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.133
Snap,
that was cold.

19:32.067 --> 19:34.233
- Hey.
- Sorry we're so late.

19:34.267 --> 19:36.933
So, what happened
with the mom-crush?

19:36.967 --> 19:39.067
Pretty sure
I dirty-bombed that friendship.

19:39.067 --> 19:41.567
You think I'm a nice person,
don't you?

19:41.600 --> 19:43.567
If you were just
"a nice person,"

19:43.600 --> 19:45.467
we wouldn't be friends.
Come here.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.767
I worship you.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.100
Littles?

19:49.133 --> 19:51.900
Perfect angels.
What else...

19:51.933 --> 19:53.433
There's a load of laundry
in the dryer,

19:53.467 --> 19:56.067
I finished your grapes,
and oh, yeah,

19:56.067 --> 19:58.733
I told the kids about
starvation, war, and AIDS.

19:58.767 --> 19:59.733
And how there's no God.

19:59.767 --> 20:01.267
Okay, I love you.

20:01.300 --> 20:04.300
Love you more.
Bye.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.533
Night.

20:06.567 --> 20:07.867
Mmm.

20:07.900 --> 20:10.900
[snoring]

20:14.767 --> 20:16.800
Hey, you're snoring again.

20:16.833 --> 20:19.800
What's it?
Sex time?

20:19.833 --> 20:22.533
No. Babe,

20:22.567 --> 20:24.200
tonight sucked balls,

20:24.233 --> 20:26.600
and it wasn't entirely
your fault.

20:28.267 --> 20:30.433
Is that--
[stammers]

20:30.467 --> 20:32.800
I accept your apology.

20:32.833 --> 20:35.667
I think this Upper East Side
momzilla scene

20:35.700 --> 20:37.700
is making me crazy.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.567
Maybe it's time
for us to move.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.633
[snoring]

20:45.667 --> 20:47.267
[rock music plays]

20:47.300 --> 20:49.100
We never did find
Brooke's rock.

20:49.133 --> 20:50.700
If there's any justice
in the world,

20:50.733 --> 20:54.933
it went home
up a busboy's butthole.

20:54.967 --> 20:56.133
(Brooke)
There you are.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.100
Damn pregnancy boobs.

20:58.133 --> 21:01.067
Anyway, I feel so much better
after talking to you.

21:01.067 --> 21:03.633
I mean,
Rima's just one person.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.533
This is a big city.
It's not like she's whispering

21:06.567 --> 21:08.900
into everyone's ears
telling them what to think.

21:08.933 --> 21:11.367
(Rima on radio)
...once the main thoroughfare
of the storied towns.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.933
but now it looks
like a river.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.600
I'm Rima Chiquri-Portman...

21:14.633 --> 21:16.067
(Dentist)
I just love this reporter.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.467
She's so substantive.
Don't you think?

21:18.500 --> 21:20.133
(Man on radio)
Rima Chiquri-Portman
reports on a charity

21:20.167 --> 21:21.933
that brings bouncy castles
to Africa.

21:21.967 --> 21:24.933

[seagulls crying, splat]
(girl) Oh, dear.

21:28.967 --> 21:30.933
(boy)
Left, right,
left, right, left, right!
