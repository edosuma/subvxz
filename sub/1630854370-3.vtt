WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:11.827 --> 00:13.000
<i>How long
until Watson gets here?</i>

00:13.172 --> 00:14.206
<i>He's on
his way now.</i>

00:16.758 --> 00:17.931
You know he's
a former cop?

00:19.068 --> 00:20.896
Yeah, yeah I'm
aware of that.

00:22.379 --> 00:23.241
Excuse me.

00:26.413 --> 00:27.482
It's not a good
time, Jesse.

00:27.517 --> 00:28.655
<i>Joe,
hi it's Jesse.</i>

00:28.689 --> 00:29.517
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

00:29.551 --> 00:30.689
I know you're taking
a personal day.

00:30.724 --> 00:33.137
Yeah, I wouldn't exactly call
transporting a prisoner-

00:33.172 --> 00:35.068
halfway across the
province a personal day.

00:35.103 --> 00:35.758
No no, I know.

00:35.793 --> 00:36.724
I know, I
just meant-

00:36.758 --> 00:38.000
Well, I mean-

00:38.034 --> 00:39.862
you insisted that you be the
one to handle this yourself.

00:39.896 --> 00:41.275
<i>And not make it
a team thing.</i>

00:41.310 --> 00:42.310
<i>Also, you weren't
really forthcoming-</i>

00:42.344 --> 00:43.965
about why you volunteered
to be the one to-

00:44.000 --> 00:45.517
Jesse, is there a
reason you called?

00:45.551 --> 00:46.482
Yes, right.

00:46.517 --> 00:47.931
Okay, do you remember
the Clynburg case?

00:47.965 --> 00:49.103
Clynburg.

00:49.137 --> 00:50.379
Yeah, well it
rings a bell.

00:50.413 --> 00:52.793
80 thousand dollars worth
of stolen music memorabilia.

00:52.827 --> 00:53.724
Right right.

00:53.758 --> 00:55.379
The cold case from
about six years ago?

00:55.413 --> 00:56.137
Eight years ago.

00:56.172 --> 00:57.137
Time flies, right?

00:57.172 --> 00:58.793
<i>Anyway look.</i>

00:58.827 --> 00:59.655
One of the stolen items-

00:59.689 --> 01:01.344
a hollow body guitar-

01:01.379 --> 01:02.724
just made its way to
the black market.

01:02.758 --> 01:03.827
Okay.

01:03.862 --> 01:05.965
<i>I mean it's the lead
we've been waiting for.</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:07.724
Look, the guitar is in
my hands as we speak.

01:07.758 --> 01:08.413
So-

01:08.448 --> 01:09.827
how do you
want to proceed?

01:09.862 --> 01:11.517
I don't know Jesse.

01:11.551 --> 01:12.379
I'll get
back to you.

01:12.413 --> 01:13.551
Just take care
of it, all right?

01:13.586 --> 01:14.758
Thanks.

01:14.793 --> 01:16.482
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:16.517 --> 01:17.758
He's all yours.

01:17.793 --> 01:18.724
You've got
to be kidding.

01:18.758 --> 01:20.241
I thought Sanchez
was running transport.

01:20.275 --> 01:21.413
<i>Change of plans.</i>

01:21.448 --> 01:23.241
<i>I'll be the one transporting
you to Corner Brook.</i>

01:23.965 --> 01:25.896
Well one driver's as
good as another, I guess.

01:27.620 --> 01:28.896
Donny and Watts
rolling out.

01:28.931 --> 01:30.517
Just like the old
days, huh partner?

01:30.551 --> 01:31.620
We're not partners.

01:32.758 --> 01:33.793
Those days
are long gone.

01:34.862 --> 01:35.827
<i>Get in.</i>

01:43.655 --> 01:44.448
Hey boss.

01:44.965 --> 01:46.551
We've got a problem.

02:06.620 --> 02:07.275
Hey Rex.

02:07.620 --> 02:08.310
Get the toolbox?

02:12.103 --> 02:12.793
Rex?

02:16.862 --> 02:17.482
<i>That's it.</i>

02:17.517 --> 02:18.896
<i>Good job, buddy.</i>

02:18.931 --> 02:19.931
Yeah, put your
back into it.

02:19.965 --> 02:20.655
Just a little further.

02:25.448 --> 02:27.000
Way to go, pal.

02:30.241 --> 02:31.379
Hey!

02:31.413 --> 02:32.068
Jesse?

02:32.103 --> 02:32.724
Everything okay?

02:32.758 --> 02:34.000
Yeah, absolutely.

02:34.034 --> 02:34.931
More than okay.

02:34.965 --> 02:36.551
I just got assigned
lead on my own case.

02:37.827 --> 02:38.793
Is that right?

02:38.827 --> 02:41.275
Yeah, Joe got pulled
to some private matter.

02:41.310 --> 02:41.965
Oh yeah.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.517
<i>The Blake Watson thing.</i>

02:43.551 --> 02:44.551
He told you
what it was?

02:45.206 --> 02:45.896
Yeah why?

02:45.931 --> 02:46.896
He didn't
mention it to you?

02:47.827 --> 02:48.586
Yeah.

02:48.620 --> 02:50.241
<i>Yeah, we're
tight like that.</i>

02:50.275 --> 02:51.965
So who's Blake Watson?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.827
He's Joe's old partner
from back in the day.

02:54.862 --> 02:56.517
Joe caught him
tampering with evidence.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.862
Blew the
whistle on him.

02:58.896 --> 02:59.931
Blake got his
badge taken away.

02:59.965 --> 03:01.551
A couple of years later
he was behind bars.

03:01.586 --> 03:03.413
So no love lost
between the two huh?

03:03.448 --> 03:05.000
Yeah, I don't know
the whole story.

03:05.034 --> 03:05.862
But if Joe's
pulling strings-

03:05.896 --> 03:06.862
for this transportation gig-

03:06.896 --> 03:07.965
he's going to
have a reason.

03:08.620 --> 03:09.310
You were saying
something-

03:09.344 --> 03:09.965
about a case?

03:10.000 --> 03:10.931
Yeah, okay
so get this.

03:10.965 --> 03:12.172
A few years ago-

03:12.206 --> 03:14.137
somebody robbed a private
music memorabilia collection.

03:14.172 --> 03:16.482
Oh yeah, I remember
something about that.

03:17.793 --> 03:18.965
More Chuck Berry.

03:21.551 --> 03:22.793
Excuse me?

03:23.862 --> 03:26.034
You knew it was Chuck Berry's
guitar that was stolen, right?

03:26.068 --> 03:27.000
Uhh-

03:27.689 --> 03:29.827
Jesse, back in 1977-

03:30.689 --> 03:32.241
NASA sent the
Voyager Probe-

03:32.275 --> 03:33.103
into space.

03:33.137 --> 03:34.448
And one of the things
that was in it-

03:34.482 --> 03:35.655
<i>was a disc-</i>

03:35.758 --> 03:37.724
<i>containing some of the
greatest recordings of all time.</i>

03:37.758 --> 03:41.448
Bach, Mozart,
Louis Armstrong-

03:41.482 --> 03:43.344
and Chuck Berry.

03:44.068 --> 03:45.793
Is there a
point to this?

03:45.827 --> 03:46.724
<i>Rumour has it-</i>

03:46.758 --> 03:49.241
that NASA
received a response-

03:51.344 --> 03:52.655
from aliens.

03:54.931 --> 03:56.448
What did they say?

03:57.275 --> 03:58.172
Send-

03:58.275 --> 03:59.034
more-

04:00.793 --> 04:01.620
Chuck-

04:02.103 --> 04:02.862
Berry.

04:08.689 --> 04:09.344
Okay, so-

04:09.379 --> 04:10.206
I would really
like to-

04:10.241 --> 04:11.448
get a leg up
on this thing.

04:11.482 --> 04:13.344
I have a few theories
I want to run by you.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.517
Okay Jesse, this
case is how old?

04:14.551 --> 04:15.206
Six years?

04:15.241 --> 04:16.103
Eight years.

04:16.137 --> 04:17.448
Okay, so it can wait
another half hour.

04:17.482 --> 04:18.241
So make yourself useful.

04:18.275 --> 04:20.517
And help me
finish this.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.206
Come on.

04:21.241 --> 04:22.034
Okay.

04:31.482 --> 04:32.482
Yeah, I'm still here.

04:35.137 --> 04:37.586
Oh the silent
treatment, huh?

04:37.620 --> 04:39.310
It's going to be a
long trip then, I guess.

04:39.344 --> 04:42.206
What is it eight, nine hours
to Corner Brook Pen?

04:46.448 --> 04:47.137
So how's your daughter?

04:47.172 --> 04:47.793
She must be-

04:47.827 --> 04:49.448
Do not talk
about her.

04:49.482 --> 04:50.793
Whoa, okay relax.

04:50.827 --> 04:52.517
I was just
making small talk.

04:54.931 --> 04:56.413
Please tell me you brought
some snacks or something?

04:56.448 --> 04:57.103
I'm starving.

04:57.137 --> 04:58.379
Yeah, you'll live.

04:58.413 --> 04:59.758
<i>You know-</i>

04:59.793 --> 05:00.620
I'm starting
to think-

05:00.655 --> 05:01.551
the only reason
you're here-

05:01.586 --> 05:02.413
is to make
this trip-

05:02.448 --> 05:04.275
as miserable
as possible.

05:04.310 --> 05:05.655
It's more of a perk
than a reason.

05:06.344 --> 05:07.344
Funny guy.

05:07.379 --> 05:09.241
So why are
you here, Joe?

05:09.551 --> 05:10.620
<i>The moment I heard-</i>

05:10.655 --> 05:12.344
they were transferring
you to a different prison-

05:12.379 --> 05:15.034
I immediately thought you
were going to try something.

05:15.068 --> 05:16.034
Seriously?

05:16.068 --> 05:18.620
You think I got a price
on my head on purpose?

05:18.655 --> 05:20.344
You tried to sell the leader
of the Aryan Brotherhood

05:20.379 --> 05:21.413
up the river.

05:21.448 --> 05:22.724
Didn't think that wasn't
going to get back to him?

05:22.758 --> 05:23.413
Come on man.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.379
Well I'm off my game.

05:24.413 --> 05:26.206
12 years behind bars
will do that to a guy.

05:26.241 --> 05:28.206
Yeah, well you
know what I think?

05:28.241 --> 05:28.896
Enlighten me.

05:29.344 --> 05:31.034
I think-

05:31.068 --> 05:33.206
that you intentionally got on
the wrong side of a killer-

05:33.241 --> 05:35.103
so that they would have no
choice but to transfer you.

05:35.137 --> 05:36.413
Why would
I do that?

05:36.448 --> 05:37.655
<i>It's easier to escape
from a transfer-</i>

05:37.689 --> 05:40.551
than it is from the
inside of a prison cell.

05:40.586 --> 05:42.379
So I figured you
would do that.

05:43.413 --> 05:45.758
I've got less than 14
months left on my stretch.

05:45.793 --> 05:46.965
Why would I
try to escape-

05:47.000 --> 05:48.517
when I can walk away
a free man, huh?

05:48.551 --> 05:49.344
Tell me that?

05:49.379 --> 05:50.448
If you ratted out
the Brotherhood-

05:50.482 --> 05:53.206
we both know you're not
going to survive 14 months.

05:53.310 --> 05:55.620
<i>So here we are.</i>

05:55.655 --> 05:57.448
You and me, man.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.620
You and me.

06:10.310 --> 06:12.206
Is that really
his signature?

06:12.241 --> 06:14.241
Yeah, it was authenticated
before it was stolen.

06:14.275 --> 06:16.206
Well the owner will be
happy to get this back.

06:16.241 --> 06:18.206
Mr. Clynburg passed away
shortly after the robbery.

06:18.241 --> 06:19.344
Then his family will.

06:20.034 --> 06:21.000
<i>No no.</i>

06:21.034 --> 06:22.379
Clynburg wanted everything
sent to a museum.

06:22.413 --> 06:23.275
So-

06:23.310 --> 06:24.206
<i>you'll dust this
for fingerprints?</i>

06:24.241 --> 06:24.862
<i>Trace evidence?</i>

06:24.896 --> 06:25.517
<i>DNA?</i>

06:25.551 --> 06:26.551
Yep, of course.

06:26.586 --> 06:27.241
Excellent.

06:27.344 --> 06:28.000
Okay.

06:28.034 --> 06:29.275
Well I am going
to go see-

06:29.310 --> 06:32.000
if I can track down the original
detective notes from archives.

06:34.413 --> 06:35.379
Hmm.

06:36.172 --> 06:37.896
He's taking this
very seriously.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.310
Yeah, he's been
trying to prove to Joe-

06:39.344 --> 06:40.862
he can be more
than just a lab tech.

06:40.896 --> 06:41.896
It'll be good
for him.

06:43.517 --> 06:44.482
So I'll see
you later?

06:46.241 --> 06:47.000
Yeah.

06:48.517 --> 06:49.172
That you will.

06:49.206 --> 06:49.862
Yes.

06:49.896 --> 06:51.413
You too, my
handsome guy.

06:51.448 --> 06:52.310
You too.

06:58.482 --> 07:00.172
We had some good
times back in the day.

07:00.206 --> 07:01.724
Didn't we Joe?

07:01.758 --> 07:02.896
Yeah, well if
you say so.

07:04.586 --> 07:05.448
Come on, man.

07:05.482 --> 07:06.586
Don't pretend like
you don't miss it.

07:07.758 --> 07:09.103
What about Spencer's cabin?

07:09.413 --> 07:10.137
Remember that?

07:11.241 --> 07:12.413
Middle of the woods.

07:12.448 --> 07:14.517
Beer and poker
'til the sun came up.

07:14.551 --> 07:15.379
Yeah yeah.

07:15.413 --> 07:16.206
I do remember that.

07:17.241 --> 07:18.482
The cabin's not
too far from here.

07:18.517 --> 07:19.724
I don't-

07:19.758 --> 07:21.827
Yeah it's not too far
from here if I remember.

07:22.517 --> 07:23.517
Yeah maybe
when I get out-

07:23.551 --> 07:25.310
I'll go see it for
myself, huh, partner?

07:25.344 --> 07:26.137
Don't call me that.

07:26.793 --> 07:27.448
Come on man.

07:27.482 --> 07:28.586
Was I really
that bad?

07:29.931 --> 07:31.172
I always had
your back.

07:31.206 --> 07:32.689
<i>I would have taken
a bullet for you.</i>

07:32.724 --> 07:34.379
Yeah let's be glad
it never came to that.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.896
It's true.

07:36.655 --> 07:37.689
You weren't
just my partner.

07:37.724 --> 07:38.655
You were my friend.

07:39.758 --> 07:40.793
At least I
thought you were.

07:40.827 --> 07:41.655
Until you slid
that blade-

07:41.689 --> 07:42.482
in my back.

07:42.517 --> 07:43.620
Right, there it is.

07:43.655 --> 07:44.448
Right?

07:44.482 --> 07:45.724
After 20 years-

07:45.758 --> 07:47.000
it's still my fault you can't
take responsibility for all-

07:47.034 --> 07:49.310
You ratted me out
to Internal Affairs.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.517
You planted evidence
on a suspect!

07:51.551 --> 07:53.896
I did what needed to be done to
get a dirtbag off the street.

07:53.931 --> 07:54.586
Guess what Watson?

07:54.620 --> 07:55.689
It doesn't work like that.

07:55.724 --> 07:58.137
Here we go with the holier-
than-thou Joe Donovan.

07:58.172 --> 07:59.482
<i>So this is all
my fault, right?</i>

07:59.517 --> 08:01.310
What about everything
that happened afterwards?

08:01.344 --> 08:03.344
What about the
drinking, Watson?

08:03.448 --> 08:05.172
<i>What about the
assault charges?</i>

08:05.206 --> 08:05.931
<i>What about the embezzlement?</i>

08:07.068 --> 08:08.551
The thing that actually
got you thrown in a prison?

08:09.310 --> 08:10.172
Is that my
fault too?

08:10.206 --> 08:11.586
Is that why took
this assignment, Joe?

08:11.620 --> 08:12.758
So you could
be my mother?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.586
No, I took this assignment
because I don not trust you.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.620
Yeah well
trust me or not.

08:15.655 --> 08:16.793
I've still got
to use the can.

08:16.827 --> 08:18.206
You want to pull
over for a minute?

08:18.241 --> 08:20.482
Unfortunately this train
makes no stops my friend.

08:20.517 --> 08:21.172
Come on man.

08:21.206 --> 08:22.413
Nature calls.

08:22.448 --> 08:24.310
You want me making a mess of
your nice leather seats here?

08:27.103 --> 08:28.137
Fine fine.

08:28.172 --> 08:29.896
There's a rest stop about
20 minutes up the road.

08:30.896 --> 08:31.965
We'll stop there.

08:33.172 --> 08:34.620
Thank you.

09:11.896 --> 09:12.620
<i>Hey!</i>

09:12.655 --> 09:13.862
<i>Let's go!</i>

09:13.896 --> 09:15.000
<i>Give me two
minutes, will you?</i>

09:15.034 --> 09:16.827
<i>This ain't easy
with the cuffs on!</i>

09:16.862 --> 09:18.241
<i>Two minutes?</i>

09:18.275 --> 09:19.275
<i>You've got one!</i>

09:42.310 --> 09:43.551
<i>Hurry up!</i>

09:43.586 --> 09:44.896
<i>What's your damn rush?</i>

09:44.931 --> 09:46.310
<i>It's not like there's
any windows in here.</i>

09:46.344 --> 09:48.448
<i>You worried I'm going to
escape through the pipes?</i>

09:48.482 --> 09:50.379
Just hurry up
all right?

09:58.551 --> 09:59.275
Hey!

09:59.965 --> 10:00.724
Oh my gosh!

10:00.758 --> 10:01.689
Is that your
daughter in there?

10:01.724 --> 10:02.793
<i>Yes!</i>

10:02.827 --> 10:04.310
<i>We've got to get your
daughter out of there!</i>

10:04.344 --> 10:04.965
It could blow!

10:05.000 --> 10:06.206
Listen sweetheart!

10:06.241 --> 10:07.413
We're going to get
you out okay?

10:08.000 --> 10:08.689
Go with your mom!

10:08.724 --> 10:09.344
Go!

10:09.379 --> 10:10.586
Go go go go!

10:11.517 --> 10:13.586
We need some
help here!

10:16.827 --> 10:17.482
Go!

10:21.034 --> 10:21.689
<i>Here.</i>

10:22.482 --> 10:23.241
<i>Get those off.</i>

10:23.275 --> 10:25.206
<i>And let's get
out of here.</i>

10:26.793 --> 10:27.896
Knox.

10:27.931 --> 10:28.758
What are you
doing here?

10:28.793 --> 10:30.000
Watson.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.000
It's been too long.

10:33.310 --> 10:34.275
Good to see you.

10:34.379 --> 10:35.310
What are you
waiting for man?

10:35.344 --> 10:36.137
Let's go.

10:36.172 --> 10:37.379
<i>Yeah!</i>

10:37.413 --> 10:38.413
Come on.

10:38.448 --> 10:39.344
Hop in.

10:40.275 --> 10:41.620
Where else
you gonna go?

10:44.103 --> 10:44.931
Watson?

10:45.862 --> 10:46.862
<i>Watson!</i>

10:55.896 --> 10:57.000
Watson!

11:09.965 --> 11:10.655
Hey.

11:12.137 --> 11:13.758
You found your way
back to the car.

11:15.068 --> 11:15.724
I told you Joe.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.965
I'm almost
done my time.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.310
I'm ready to
get my life back.

11:21.965 --> 11:23.689
You wouldn't happen
to have anything to do-

11:23.724 --> 11:24.827
with that fire
would you?

11:25.965 --> 11:27.862
That'd be one hell
of a blue angel, Joe.

11:30.793 --> 11:31.758
Blue angel.

11:32.965 --> 11:33.793
Right.

11:35.689 --> 11:36.586
Let's go.

12:01.827 --> 12:02.931
What was that
all about huh?

12:03.689 --> 12:05.241
Did he change his
mind when he saw you?

12:05.965 --> 12:07.172
How should I know?

12:07.620 --> 12:08.827
Relax, Gregory.

12:09.862 --> 12:12.137
It's still a long way
to Corner Brook.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.586
I don't think they'll be making
it all the way to Corner Brook.

12:16.448 --> 12:17.482
Why is that?

12:18.310 --> 12:19.034
Don't worry.

12:19.620 --> 12:20.689
I got it covered.

12:21.793 --> 12:22.827
Wow.

12:22.862 --> 12:25.482
Now I'm filled with
relief, Gregory.

12:46.172 --> 12:47.724
I know I talk a
good game, but-

12:50.482 --> 12:52.172
I really messed
up this time Joe.

12:53.413 --> 12:54.931
The Brotherhood can
get to me in Corner Brook-

12:54.965 --> 12:57.620
just as easily as
in St. John's pen.

12:57.655 --> 12:58.827
You don't know that.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.655
You can't guarantee
my safety on the inside.

13:00.689 --> 13:01.344
And you know it.

13:01.379 --> 13:02.517
No I can't.

13:03.310 --> 13:04.655
But I also can't
let you go.

13:04.689 --> 13:06.379
I need your
help Joe.

13:06.413 --> 13:09.000
Let me make one thing
really clear okay?

13:09.724 --> 13:11.379
I'm here for
one reason.

13:11.413 --> 13:14.620
That is to get you to
Corner Brook without incident.

13:30.379 --> 13:31.000
Change of venue?

13:31.034 --> 13:31.655
Huh?

13:31.689 --> 13:32.620
Yeah.

13:32.655 --> 13:34.137
Yeah I just needed
another place to think.

13:34.172 --> 13:35.620
What do you have?

13:36.034 --> 13:39.206
Okay so the robbery took place
between 7:00 AM and 4:00 PM.

13:39.310 --> 13:41.620
<i>Now the owner,
David Clynburg-</i>

13:41.655 --> 13:43.827
he was at the hospital
for some planned surgery.

13:43.862 --> 13:44.689
But when he
got home-

13:44.724 --> 13:45.413
the door was locked.

13:45.448 --> 13:46.103
No signs of tampering.

13:46.137 --> 13:48.068
<i>First thing he notices-</i>

13:48.103 --> 13:50.137
is that the music memorabilia
collection is gone.

13:50.172 --> 13:52.206
Not a single other
thing in the apartment-

13:52.241 --> 13:53.413
<i>was out of place.</i>

13:53.448 --> 13:55.206
Okay so it wasn't
a random B&E.

13:55.241 --> 13:56.379
His collection was targeted.

13:56.413 --> 13:58.241
Probably by somebody
Clynburg knew and trusted.

13:58.275 --> 13:59.000
Right.

13:59.034 --> 14:00.172
Which brings us
to our suspects.

14:00.206 --> 14:01.344
Here, have a seat.

14:02.448 --> 14:04.310
Okay, suspect number one.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.413
Ah- yeah.

14:05.896 --> 14:06.689
This lady.

14:06.724 --> 14:07.862
Tammy Markov.

14:07.896 --> 14:08.862
She's Clynburg's neighbour.

14:08.896 --> 14:11.000
He would have her
over for tea and chess.

14:11.034 --> 14:12.896
He also entrusted her
with his spare condo key.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.689
Anyone else
have his key?

14:14.724 --> 14:15.724
His family?

14:15.758 --> 14:17.793
No, his wife passed away
several years previous.

14:17.827 --> 14:18.689
He had a son.

14:18.724 --> 14:21.172
But they were
estranged at the time.

14:21.206 --> 14:22.517
Okay well so aside
from the key-

14:22.551 --> 14:24.655
what makes Tammy Markov
such a compelling suspect?

14:24.689 --> 14:25.862
Okay so Tammy-

14:26.482 --> 14:28.034
she was moving out
that exact same day.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.517
She had movers
coming and going-

14:29.551 --> 14:30.620
in and out
of the condo-

14:30.655 --> 14:31.620
<i>at the time
of the robbery.</i>

14:31.655 --> 14:32.482
<i>One of her movers-</i>

14:32.517 --> 14:33.724
<i>this guy here-</i>

14:33.758 --> 14:34.586
<i>Victor Hess-</i>

14:34.620 --> 14:36.655
<i>he's had two
priors for theft.</i>

14:36.689 --> 14:38.448
I mean what if he and Tammy
were working together?

14:38.482 --> 14:40.724
Stolen memorabilia just
goes right out the front door-

14:40.758 --> 14:42.379
in one of those
moving boxes-

14:42.413 --> 14:44.379
without anybody
batting an eyebrow.

14:44.413 --> 14:45.068
Makes sense.

14:45.103 --> 14:46.413
The original investigators-

14:46.448 --> 14:47.896
did they ever look into
Tammy and Victor?

14:47.931 --> 14:48.965
<i>No, see
here's the thing.</i>

14:49.000 --> 14:52.103
<i>Tammy or Victor were
never formally charged.</i>

14:52.137 --> 14:53.517
There was no
trail to follow-

14:53.551 --> 14:55.379
and no trace of the
stolen memorabilia.

14:55.413 --> 14:56.517
Until today.

14:57.172 --> 14:58.206
So what's your
next move?

14:58.241 --> 14:59.620
<i>Well I mean we're still
waiting for the guitar-</i>

14:59.655 --> 15:01.137
to come back
from forensics.

15:01.172 --> 15:02.172
But in the meantime-

15:02.206 --> 15:04.655
I'm thinking that we
pay a visit to the condo.

15:04.689 --> 15:07.931
<i>Maybe the new owner will
let us take a look around-</i>

15:07.965 --> 15:09.862
have a lay of the
land, so to speak.

15:11.000 --> 15:11.620
Okay.

15:11.655 --> 15:12.689
Let me know
how it goes.

15:12.724 --> 15:13.448
<i>Yeah?</i>

15:13.482 --> 15:15.827
That the right
next move, yeah?

15:15.862 --> 15:17.275
Can't hurt.

15:17.310 --> 15:18.275
Okay.

15:19.103 --> 15:20.344
You're saying
don't overthink it.

15:20.793 --> 15:21.586
I got you.

15:30.068 --> 15:30.931
The engine's overheating.

15:31.034 --> 15:32.931
You going
to pull over?

15:32.965 --> 15:34.862
Yeah there's a garage
off the next exit.

15:34.896 --> 15:35.620
<i>No no.</i>

15:35.655 --> 15:36.413
<i>You don't
need a garage.</i>

15:36.448 --> 15:37.103
<i>Pull over.</i>

15:37.137 --> 15:38.551
<i>I can take
a look.</i>

15:38.586 --> 15:39.241
Yeah- no.

15:39.275 --> 15:40.206
No thanks.

15:40.241 --> 15:41.793
I think I'll let the
experts handle this one.

16:00.206 --> 16:01.103
Thanks.

16:07.793 --> 16:09.275
Everything okay?

16:09.310 --> 16:11.241
Yeah he says we've got
a punctured radiator.

16:12.448 --> 16:13.344
You know anything
about that?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.379
So this is about
20 minutes to fix.

16:17.413 --> 16:18.241
We'll be
on our way.

16:18.275 --> 16:19.689
So can we grab
a bite to eat?

16:20.896 --> 16:21.827
I don't know
about that.

16:21.862 --> 16:22.517
<i>Ah, come on.</i>

16:22.551 --> 16:23.551
What am I
going to do?

16:23.586 --> 16:24.448
Make a
run for it?

16:24.482 --> 16:25.655
I already had the
chance, remember?

16:27.344 --> 16:28.000
Come on.

16:28.034 --> 16:30.310
For old times'
sake Joe.

16:30.344 --> 16:32.275
<i>Besides I bought last
time we were together.</i>

16:32.310 --> 16:33.206
So you owe me.

16:37.551 --> 16:38.586
<i>Have a fry.</i>

16:38.793 --> 16:39.827
<i>I don't want a fry.</i>

16:39.862 --> 16:41.034
<i>No?</i>

16:41.068 --> 16:43.758
You lived on these things
back when we were on patrol.

16:43.793 --> 16:44.896
Yeah that was
20 years ago.

16:44.931 --> 16:46.172
I've got to watch
myself now.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.517
So you been good?

16:50.379 --> 16:51.034
Yeah.

16:51.655 --> 16:52.655
<i>I just
want to say-</i>

16:52.689 --> 16:54.413
<i>I really appreciate you
doing this for me.</i>

16:54.448 --> 16:56.586
Feels good having Joe
Donovan have my back.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.551
Even though I
stabbed you in it?

16:59.862 --> 17:01.206
I was a
bad cop.

17:02.172 --> 17:03.344
We all do what
we do, right?

17:06.206 --> 17:08.724
<i>I wasn't just giving
you a hard time earlier.</i>

17:08.758 --> 17:11.379
I really do hope your
daughter is doing well.

17:11.413 --> 17:13.275
She was just an ankle
biter when I saw her last.

17:13.310 --> 17:14.931
And what- she's
17, 18 now?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.068
She's 19.

17:20.482 --> 17:22.034
19 and she's
doing great.

17:23.758 --> 17:25.379
Yeah here she is.

17:26.620 --> 17:27.448
Whoah.

17:28.379 --> 17:29.172
Look at that.

17:30.413 --> 17:32.172
They do grow
up fast huh?

17:32.206 --> 17:33.172
Yeah.

17:33.206 --> 17:34.551
<i>I guess it's too
late for me now.</i>

17:34.586 --> 17:35.689
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

17:36.482 --> 17:37.137
Go in.

17:37.172 --> 17:37.931
Finish your time.

17:37.965 --> 17:38.586
Get out.

17:38.620 --> 17:39.586
Keep your nose clean.

17:39.620 --> 17:40.344
Still make some memories.

17:42.965 --> 17:44.448
If those fries
don't kill you first.

17:45.413 --> 17:47.448
Yeah it's not them
I'm worried about.

17:47.482 --> 17:48.310
Don't talk like that.

17:48.344 --> 17:49.827
<i>I know.</i>

17:49.862 --> 17:51.241
You've made
your position clear.

17:51.275 --> 17:52.137
I made my
own bed.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.931
Now I get to
lie in it right?

17:56.068 --> 17:57.103
You know, we
should get going.

17:58.482 --> 17:59.275
Sure thing partner.

18:01.068 --> 18:02.310
Before we
hit the road-

18:02.344 --> 18:04.103
one more thing
I've got to do.

18:04.137 --> 18:05.206
<i>Are you serious?</i>

18:05.241 --> 18:06.827
Man, the pop's running
right through me.

18:07.482 --> 18:08.827
Come on, it'll just
take a minute.

18:11.034 --> 18:11.862
Okay.

18:11.896 --> 18:12.793
Let me see
the cuffs.

18:13.379 --> 18:14.137
Really?

18:16.068 --> 18:16.724
This is a surprise.

18:16.758 --> 18:19.172
You trust me now?

18:19.275 --> 18:20.827
Not quite.

18:24.620 --> 18:27.379
You really think
this is necessary?

18:27.413 --> 18:28.793
I'm not taking my
eyes off you again.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.862
I can't go with
an audience.

18:31.896 --> 18:33.034
Yeah well don't
worry about it.

18:33.068 --> 18:37.172
I'm not watching what
you're doing okay?

18:37.206 --> 18:38.241
Watson just
hurry up okay?

18:38.275 --> 18:39.344
<i>Okay okay.</i>

18:39.379 --> 18:40.551
<i>Doing my
best all right?</i>

18:41.724 --> 18:42.344
Oh hey.

18:42.379 --> 18:43.448
And uh-

18:43.482 --> 18:44.931
I just want
to tell you.

18:44.965 --> 18:45.586
I'm sorry.

18:45.620 --> 18:46.758
Sorry for what?

18:47.413 --> 18:48.103
<i>Hey!</i>

18:48.620 --> 18:49.310
How did you- ?

18:49.724 --> 18:51.137
You left me no
choice, partner.

18:54.000 --> 18:54.827
Give me the key.

18:54.862 --> 18:55.482
Or what?

18:55.517 --> 18:56.724
You'll shoot me?

18:56.758 --> 18:57.413
Go ahead.

18:58.413 --> 18:59.448
It'll be a
lot quicker-

18:59.482 --> 19:01.413
than what's waiting
for me at Corner Brook.

19:03.275 --> 19:04.448
Okay listen to me.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.034
Okay I'm telling
you right now.

19:06.068 --> 19:07.275
I can help you.

19:07.310 --> 19:08.793
I know you'd
try, Joe.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.034
Because you're a decent guy.

19:11.206 --> 19:13.000
Thanks for the hamburger.

19:13.827 --> 19:14.586
<i>Hey!</i>

19:15.517 --> 19:16.310
Watson!

19:18.896 --> 19:19.551
Wait!

19:20.482 --> 19:21.137
Wait!

19:23.551 --> 19:24.517
Come on!

19:35.034 --> 19:37.000
<i>Hey did you see a tall
guy come through here?</i>

19:37.275 --> 19:38.103
<i>Blue jumpsuit?</i>

19:38.586 --> 19:39.517
Okay.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.689
Don't give
us a reason.

19:52.862 --> 19:53.758
Marty Knox.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.034
Superintendent Donovan.

19:56.137 --> 19:58.689
You're a long
ways from home.

19:58.724 --> 20:00.034
Ah we're both
slumming it today.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.310
Blake Watson tends
to drag a man down.

20:05.275 --> 20:07.172
This doesn't need
to get messy, Joe.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.793
<i>I just want Watson.</i>

20:10.172 --> 20:11.241
That makes
two of us.

20:18.068 --> 20:20.137
We could just waste
him right here.

20:20.172 --> 20:21.448
Right.

20:21.482 --> 20:22.448
Then you'll never
find Watson.

20:24.068 --> 20:25.517
Pardon my partner, Joe.

20:26.275 --> 20:27.758
He's new around here.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.896
How are you going
to build a career-

20:30.931 --> 20:32.655
<i>if you waste a
cop on a whim?</i>

20:33.275 --> 20:34.103
<i>Think.</i>

20:35.862 --> 20:39.172
You only do that when it
becomes absolutely necessary.

20:42.965 --> 20:44.448
<i>Thank you for
agreeing to see me-</i>

20:44.482 --> 20:45.206
on such short notice.

20:45.241 --> 20:45.862
Sure sure.

20:45.896 --> 20:46.724
Come in, come in.

20:47.103 --> 20:47.724
No problem.

20:47.758 --> 20:48.379
Um-

20:49.379 --> 20:51.344
So- what do you want
to talk to me about?

20:51.379 --> 20:52.551
Right, yeah.

20:52.586 --> 20:55.310
I want to discuss with you a
case from a few years back.

20:55.344 --> 20:57.689
A break, enter and theft
against one of the owners.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.862
That was Mr. Clynburg.

20:59.896 --> 21:00.965
Yes, that's right.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.379
And you were the building
manager at that time.

21:02.413 --> 21:03.689
Yeah, still am.

21:03.724 --> 21:04.379
Look at me.

21:04.413 --> 21:05.482
Moving up
in the world.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.034
Well we've had some
recent developments.

21:08.068 --> 21:09.931
And I would
like to um-

21:11.689 --> 21:12.517
This music-

21:15.551 --> 21:18.620
Yeah, it's some jazz
compilation on vinyl-

21:18.655 --> 21:19.827
I picked up at
a garage sale.

21:19.931 --> 21:21.137
I'll turn it off.

21:21.172 --> 21:21.896
No no, that's okay.

21:21.931 --> 21:22.793
I like it.

21:23.862 --> 21:24.965
Um-

21:25.000 --> 21:26.551
you were saying you had
some new leads or something?

21:26.586 --> 21:27.689
Yeah yeah.

21:27.724 --> 21:28.965
I was hoping you could show
me around the building.

21:29.000 --> 21:29.827
You know,
maybe the unit-

21:29.862 --> 21:31.965
<i>that Mr. Clynburg
lived in-</i>

21:32.000 --> 21:33.965
as well as the one that
belonged to Tammy Markov.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.655
Of course, yeah.

21:35.689 --> 21:37.137
Great- and you have
keys to the units?

21:37.172 --> 21:38.482
Oh yeah.

21:38.517 --> 21:39.241
Only the empty ones.

21:40.275 --> 21:41.793
The locks are changed
when new owners move in.

21:41.827 --> 21:43.310
<i>But I'm sure
they'd be happy-</i>

21:43.344 --> 21:44.758
to let you have
a look around.

21:44.793 --> 21:46.241
And who cares
if they're happy.

21:46.655 --> 21:47.655
I'm the manager, right?

21:49.000 --> 21:49.689
Excellent.

21:59.137 --> 22:01.206
An old fishing shack
in the woods huh?

22:01.241 --> 22:04.034
How come I can't see
any road on the map?

22:04.655 --> 22:05.793
Because it's unmarked.

22:06.965 --> 22:09.931
What makes you so sure
Watson didn't hightail it?

22:10.482 --> 22:11.862
He's got no friends.

22:11.896 --> 22:13.103
<i>He's got no cash.</i>

22:13.137 --> 22:15.000
<i>He's got no way of getting
a ticket off this island-</i>

22:15.034 --> 22:15.827
<i>without getting flagged.</i>

22:15.862 --> 22:16.827
That's how I know.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.344
This better
be the truth.

22:19.965 --> 22:22.034
Look, I put myself out on
a limb with my bosses-

22:22.068 --> 22:23.931
in order to transport
this guy myself.

22:24.862 --> 22:26.103
Thought I was
doing him a favour.

22:26.137 --> 22:29.068
And look
where it got me.

22:29.758 --> 22:32.000
I guess his loyalties
lie elsewhere huh?

22:33.724 --> 22:34.758
I guess so.

22:36.310 --> 22:38.724
<i>Man, you must be
Brian Patrick's nephew.</i>

22:40.275 --> 22:41.206
How'd you know that?

22:41.758 --> 22:43.172
<i>Charming Irish personality.</i>

22:43.275 --> 22:45.793
Same weird taste
in footwear.

22:45.827 --> 22:49.103
<i>One ham sandwich
away from a heart attack.</i>

22:49.137 --> 22:51.034
Yeah, you've
got to be related.

22:51.068 --> 22:55.103
But it looks like Watson crossed
your family as well as me.

22:55.137 --> 22:58.034
So I guess we've got
that in common huh?

22:58.137 --> 23:00.379
<i>You're on
your own, pal.</i>

23:00.413 --> 23:02.931
<i>Watson's a friend
of the family.</i>

23:02.965 --> 23:04.448
Thought he'd be
excited to see us.

23:04.482 --> 23:06.827
Instead he gets all
squirrelly at the gas station.

23:06.931 --> 23:08.275
The gas station?

23:10.655 --> 23:12.931
Wait so the fire
wasn't an accident?

23:13.206 --> 23:15.068
Oh, it's like
having a trainee.

23:15.103 --> 23:17.068
<i>I'm too old
for this I swear.</i>

23:17.103 --> 23:19.103
No need to tell him
our life story Greg.

23:19.137 --> 23:22.379
Looks like all of our bosses
are mad at us huh?

23:23.310 --> 23:24.482
Wait- you guys
tell me the truth.

23:24.517 --> 23:25.689
Which one of
you do you think-

23:25.724 --> 23:26.862
<i>your boss is
going to hit first?</i>

23:26.896 --> 23:27.620
Huh?

23:27.655 --> 23:28.793
Not me.

23:28.827 --> 23:29.758
He's not your
friend, Greg.

23:29.793 --> 23:31.000
Greg, tell me.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.896
Look, the gas station was
supposed to be the pickup right?

23:32.931 --> 23:35.103
<i>But Watson went
with me instead.</i>

23:35.137 --> 23:36.517
So it looks
to me-

23:36.551 --> 23:37.931
like your family's
losing clout.

23:37.965 --> 23:39.413
Oh, bull.

23:39.448 --> 23:40.586
This guy spooked him.

23:40.620 --> 23:41.517
Ah, don't worry
about that.

23:41.551 --> 23:42.620
No.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.206
See because your uncle's
going to be really happy-

23:44.241 --> 23:47.965
with the fact that you guys
chose to puncture the radiator.

23:48.931 --> 23:50.034
The radiator.

23:51.206 --> 23:53.344
That is the best idea
I've heard in my entire life.

23:53.379 --> 23:54.655
How far away
is this cabin?

23:56.241 --> 23:57.517
It's 90 minutes.

23:58.206 --> 23:59.965
But you'll never
find it without me.

24:00.068 --> 24:03.448
And you don't live
if I decide otherwise.

24:09.206 --> 24:10.413
<i>Right foot.</i>

24:10.448 --> 24:11.206
<i>That's left!</i>

24:11.896 --> 24:12.689
<i>Left.</i>

24:12.827 --> 24:13.586
<i>Okay.</i>

24:13.689 --> 24:14.448
<i>Close enough.</i>

24:15.137 --> 24:16.034
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:16.310 --> 24:17.000
Hey!

24:17.103 --> 24:17.655
Hey.

24:17.689 --> 24:18.655
So how
did it go?

24:18.689 --> 24:19.931
You find anything useful
at the crime scene?

24:19.965 --> 24:20.724
<i>No.</i>

24:20.896 --> 24:22.000
I shouldn't have
gone by myself.

24:22.034 --> 24:23.172
I didn't find
anything useful.

24:25.103 --> 24:26.137
<i>Well-</i>

24:26.172 --> 24:28.758
It is an eight-year-old
case for a reason, Jesse.

24:28.793 --> 24:30.482
Yeah but you know what
I was hoping to find-

24:30.517 --> 24:31.896
is just you know
when a case emerges-

24:31.931 --> 24:34.482
and then suddenly
everything falls into place-

24:34.517 --> 24:35.206
and-

24:36.551 --> 24:37.344
<i>I don't know.</i>

24:37.379 --> 24:38.448
<i>That's what I
was looking for.</i>

24:38.482 --> 24:39.448
Uh-

24:39.482 --> 24:42.137
Yeah well I wish
things worked that way.

24:43.172 --> 24:44.000
Yeah.

24:44.034 --> 24:45.379
<i>Yeah, this is
Detective Hudson.</i>

24:47.482 --> 24:48.137
<i>When was this?</i>

24:51.310 --> 24:52.172
Give me the address.

25:04.034 --> 25:04.689
Sarah.

25:05.931 --> 25:07.482
You know, if you keep coming
down here for little visits-

25:07.517 --> 25:09.206
people are going to
start getting suspicious.

25:12.758 --> 25:13.379
What's wrong?

25:13.413 --> 25:14.931
It's Joe.

25:16.620 --> 25:18.793
He's heading out to
Corner Brook today, right?

25:18.827 --> 25:20.068
<i>He was.</i>

25:20.103 --> 25:21.862
He brought his car to a garage
and never came back for it.

25:21.896 --> 25:23.862
The prisoner he was
transporting is also gone.

25:23.965 --> 25:26.000
We should
get out there.

25:26.034 --> 25:27.896
Yeah I chartered a flight
to an airstrip in the area.

25:27.931 --> 25:28.965
There's a car
waiting for us.

25:30.517 --> 25:31.172
Don't worry.

25:31.206 --> 25:31.896
We'll find him.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.413
Rex will make
sure of that.

25:33.448 --> 25:34.586
Yeah that's what
I'm counting on.

25:36.137 --> 25:37.344
Okay, let's go.

25:37.379 --> 25:38.206
Okay.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.103
Come on pal.

25:52.344 --> 25:53.379
Hey I've got
a question.

25:54.724 --> 25:57.068
What is it with Watson that
makes you want him dead so bad?

25:57.103 --> 25:57.931
Huh?

25:57.965 --> 25:58.931
We don't
want him dead.

25:58.965 --> 25:59.620
You don't?

26:00.965 --> 26:03.275
Seems to me like your friend
Knox here certainly does.

26:05.620 --> 26:06.862
What's he talking about?

26:09.206 --> 26:10.103
Oh wait.

26:11.413 --> 26:12.655
Wait- that's
why he took off.

26:14.034 --> 26:15.241
He didn't expect
you to be there.

26:16.310 --> 26:17.551
I mean-

26:17.586 --> 26:19.206
I know that Watson has crossed
a lot of people in his life.

26:19.241 --> 26:22.137
But it looks like you've
got a score to settle, man.

26:22.172 --> 26:23.379
That better not
be true man.

26:23.413 --> 26:24.344
We have our orders.

26:24.379 --> 26:26.448
Your uncle said get
the information-

26:26.482 --> 26:27.793
and help Watson disappear.

26:27.827 --> 26:29.551
Yeah disappear
out of the country!

26:29.586 --> 26:31.758
Yeah that's one interpretation.

26:31.793 --> 26:32.931
It's the right interpretation!

26:32.965 --> 26:34.034
Hey.

26:34.068 --> 26:36.344
<i>Last time I'm
going to tell you-</i>

26:36.379 --> 26:38.482
<i>you're not here
to think or talk!</i>

26:39.206 --> 26:39.862
Ughh!

26:41.206 --> 26:41.896
Uhh!!

26:54.586 --> 26:56.517
You should have let me
shoot him back there.

26:56.551 --> 26:57.206
No weapons.

26:57.241 --> 26:58.586
No phone.

26:58.620 --> 26:59.655
If Watson's out there-

26:59.689 --> 27:00.931
he'll lead us
right to him.

27:01.689 --> 27:02.793
You better be right.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.000
I usually am.

27:07.517 --> 27:08.344
I checked
out the car.

27:08.379 --> 27:09.620
Nothing out
of the ordinary.

27:09.655 --> 27:12.206
The mechanic says he didn't see
where Watson and Donovan went-

27:12.241 --> 27:13.689
after he brought
the car into the shop.

27:13.724 --> 27:14.517
Okay.

27:14.551 --> 27:15.758
Local police are
starting a search.

27:16.448 --> 27:17.103
Rex.

27:17.551 --> 27:18.206
Find Joe.

27:18.241 --> 27:18.931
Track him.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.275
<i>What have
you got there?</i>

27:41.931 --> 27:42.896
It's Camilla.

27:42.931 --> 27:43.758
Good find, Rex.

27:43.793 --> 27:45.896
Joe must've left
this for us to find.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.586
Whatever went down
happened right here.

27:47.620 --> 27:48.689
Well at least
we know-

27:48.724 --> 27:50.689
he was alive and well
enough to leave us a clue.

27:51.413 --> 27:52.172
That's something.

27:55.517 --> 27:56.620
Jesse, what
have you got?

27:56.724 --> 27:58.827
<i>I accessed
the GPS on Joe's car.</i>

27:58.862 --> 28:00.793
Looks like Joe made
another stop on the way-

28:00.827 --> 28:03.034
at a gas station just
off of highway seven.

28:03.068 --> 28:05.275
Nothing out of the ordinary
about stopping for gas.

28:05.310 --> 28:06.517
No, maybe not.

28:06.551 --> 28:08.000
But I looked at the footage
from the gas station cameras-

28:08.034 --> 28:09.862
and ran the plates on the
other cars that were there.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.827
There was one
car in particular-

28:11.862 --> 28:13.310
that is registered
to a company-

28:13.344 --> 28:15.000
associated to
the Patrick family.

28:15.034 --> 28:16.655
Mob boss Brian Patrick?

28:17.586 --> 28:19.379
Jesse, get a APB out
on that car immediately.

28:19.413 --> 28:20.172
Already on it.

29:09.862 --> 29:10.482
<i>Hey!</i>

29:10.517 --> 29:11.241
What the hell?

29:11.275 --> 29:12.310
Partner?

29:12.344 --> 29:13.379
Surprised to see me?

29:13.413 --> 29:14.517
No not really.

29:14.551 --> 29:15.517
Yeah?

29:15.551 --> 29:16.758
But I was hoping I'd
gotten through to you-

29:16.793 --> 29:17.931
and you wouldn't
come after me.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.758
Yeah, well then you don't
know me very well do you?

29:19.793 --> 29:20.448
Huh?

29:20.482 --> 29:21.413
And guess what?

29:21.448 --> 29:23.724
I'm not the only person
coming after you.

29:23.758 --> 29:25.275
Marty Knox is
on his way too.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.034
Yeah that's right partner!

29:27.275 --> 29:28.344
You screwed up.

29:28.965 --> 29:30.896
And this time you might
take me down with you.

29:31.931 --> 29:33.586
Okay okay.

29:43.241 --> 29:43.862
<i>Anything?</i>

29:44.724 --> 29:45.689
Yeah.

29:45.724 --> 29:47.275
Rex led me to these
in the men's bathroom-

29:47.310 --> 29:48.137
cuffed to a pipe.

29:48.172 --> 29:49.000
Nice work.

29:49.689 --> 29:50.827
Jesse.

29:50.862 --> 29:53.034
Greg Patrick's car was spotted
parked on a side road-

29:53.068 --> 29:54.517
about 90 minutes
from your location.

29:54.551 --> 29:56.241
Any visual on Joe
or his prisoner?

29:56.275 --> 29:56.931
No no.

29:56.965 --> 29:58.034
Nothing reported.

29:58.068 --> 29:59.275
But I'll get those coordinates
to you right now.

29:59.310 --> 30:02.206
<i>Oh along with some leads on
the music memorabilia theft.</i>

30:02.241 --> 30:02.965
Good job Jesse.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.137
We're on our way.

30:04.172 --> 30:04.896
Let's go.

30:05.655 --> 30:06.655
Come on pal.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.551
Hey man, how do you know
you weren't followed?

30:22.172 --> 30:23.655
How do you propose
we defend ourselves-

30:23.689 --> 30:25.000
against two armed gunmen?

30:25.758 --> 30:26.965
Best-case scenario
is that we get lucky-

30:27.000 --> 30:29.310
and they don't
even find this place.

30:29.344 --> 30:31.689
Also my team is aware
that I'm missing.

30:31.724 --> 30:32.827
And they're probably
on the hunt.

30:32.862 --> 30:35.482
So we just need to hold tight
for a couple of hours.

30:35.517 --> 30:37.068
Yeah, don't
count on it.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.655
Knox is highly motivated.

30:40.689 --> 30:41.344
Tell me something.

30:41.379 --> 30:42.103
What did you get-

30:42.241 --> 30:42.896
No.

30:43.551 --> 30:44.551
What did
you get <i>us</i>-

30:44.586 --> 30:45.275
into?

30:46.655 --> 30:48.379
The gang leader I
sold out in prison-

30:48.413 --> 30:49.689
has connections
in Corner Brook.

30:49.724 --> 30:54.068
So a prison transfer was
just delaying the inevitable.

30:54.103 --> 30:55.275
So I contacted
Brian Patrick-

30:55.310 --> 30:56.689
told him I'd give him
everything I had-

30:56.724 --> 30:58.655
on the cartels I
was working for-

30:58.689 --> 30:59.379
when I got busted.

30:59.413 --> 31:01.206
And in exchange, what?

31:01.241 --> 31:01.965
He helps spring you-

31:02.000 --> 31:02.827
during the
prison transfer.

31:02.862 --> 31:03.931
Right?

31:03.965 --> 31:06.034
Try to get you safe
passage out of the country?

31:06.068 --> 31:06.965
That was the plan.

31:07.689 --> 31:09.689
It all went out the
window when I saw Knox.

31:09.724 --> 31:11.965
So why does Knox
want you dead?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.137
Uh-

31:13.172 --> 31:15.724
I may have conned him out
of two hundred and fifty Gs.

31:15.758 --> 31:17.172
You may have?

31:17.206 --> 31:19.551
I didn't know he was working
for Brian Patrick now.

31:19.586 --> 31:20.827
Yeah well when
it comes to you-

31:20.862 --> 31:22.655
I think Knox is
working for himself.

31:26.241 --> 31:27.724
Okay so listen.

31:27.758 --> 31:30.724
You can either sit there
and feel sorry for yourself-

31:30.758 --> 31:31.655
or you canhelp me.

31:33.172 --> 31:33.793
With what?

31:34.517 --> 31:35.551
We're going
to make a-

31:36.586 --> 31:37.931
We're going to make an
early warning system.

31:40.068 --> 31:41.206
<i>Thanks for
seeing me again.</i>

31:41.241 --> 31:42.206
<i>Happy to help.</i>

31:42.241 --> 31:43.413
Did you need to
have another look-

31:43.448 --> 31:45.310
at Mr. Clynburg's
old condo?

31:45.344 --> 31:46.586
No actually-

31:46.620 --> 31:48.034
I wanted to ask you about that
record you were playing earlier.

31:48.068 --> 31:50.137
The jazz compilation?

31:50.172 --> 31:51.655
Yes that's the one.

31:51.689 --> 31:53.068
And the arrangement-

31:53.103 --> 31:55.517
was by trumpet legend
Clifford Brown.

31:55.551 --> 31:58.034
<i>But the only
thing is that-</i>

31:58.068 --> 32:00.517
that piece never actually
appeared on a compilation album.

32:00.551 --> 32:01.965
You're obviously mistaken.

32:02.000 --> 32:02.724
<i>In fact-</i>

32:02.758 --> 32:03.965
it only appeared
on vinyl once-

32:04.000 --> 32:05.103
due to a
contract dispute-

32:05.137 --> 32:06.931
and it had a print run of less
than a thousand copies.

32:06.965 --> 32:07.586
What is this?

32:07.620 --> 32:08.413
What are you trying-?

32:08.448 --> 32:09.586
<i>And of those
thousand copies-</i>

32:09.620 --> 32:12.655
only 14 of which are known
to be still in circulation-

32:12.689 --> 32:14.965
<i>one of those
was listed-</i>

32:15.000 --> 32:17.689
as one of the stolen items
from Mr. Clynburg's collection.

32:18.724 --> 32:20.068
Uh-

32:20.103 --> 32:20.793
Is that so?

32:20.827 --> 32:22.689
Mm-hmm.

32:22.724 --> 32:23.655
It's just such
a coincidence-

32:23.689 --> 32:26.896
how you happen to
own the same rare-

32:26.931 --> 32:28.068
and oh- also-

32:28.103 --> 32:30.413
insanely expensive album.

32:31.482 --> 32:33.103
<i>Unless-</i>

32:33.137 --> 32:36.137
Unless your copy and
Mr. Clynburg's copy-

32:37.310 --> 32:38.586
are one and
the same.

32:40.586 --> 32:42.206
How could I
have robbed him?

32:42.241 --> 32:43.344
I don't
have a key.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.103
And he had an
alarm system.

32:45.137 --> 32:45.965
Yes.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.137
But it wasn't
activated Miss Harris.

32:47.172 --> 32:48.310
I couldn't have
known that.

32:48.344 --> 32:49.551
That's fair.

32:49.586 --> 32:51.103
But you didn't actually need
to go through the front door.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.344
Did you?

32:52.379 --> 32:55.482
See Mr. Clynburg's apartment
had a wall adjacent to yours.

32:55.517 --> 32:56.379
So I'm betting-

32:56.413 --> 32:57.620
judging by this
phenomenal repair work-

32:57.655 --> 33:00.517
if I move your stove
away from the wall-

33:00.551 --> 33:02.448
we would just be
able to go right into-

33:02.482 --> 33:03.862
Mr. Clynburg's apartment.

33:03.896 --> 33:04.689
Isn't that right?

33:04.724 --> 33:07.310
Shall we take a
look Miss Harris?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.655
Are you even
a real cop?

33:09.689 --> 33:12.241
I'm a special constable-

33:12.275 --> 33:13.724
assigned to this case.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.620
What kind of cop
doesn't carry a gun?

33:16.655 --> 33:18.655
I mean, for
all I know-

33:18.689 --> 33:19.586
you're here
to rob me.

33:20.206 --> 33:21.379
I'm not.

33:21.413 --> 33:24.103
A woman alone in her home
has a right to defend herself.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.482
<i>I could
really use a drink.</i>

33:29.517 --> 33:30.275
Yeah.

33:30.310 --> 33:31.137
Yeah, you
and me both.

33:33.172 --> 33:34.482
It's a shame these
are empty man.

33:35.310 --> 33:37.862
Yeah well if they weren't they'd
probably be skunky by now so-

33:38.896 --> 33:40.103
Oh man-

33:40.137 --> 33:43.068
still better than the toilet
gin they serve at club Fed.

33:44.034 --> 33:44.689
<i>Hey.</i>

33:45.827 --> 33:46.965
<i>A toast.</i>

33:48.137 --> 33:49.103
To the old days.

33:50.206 --> 33:51.689
Before it all
went to hell.

33:52.758 --> 33:53.827
To the old days.

33:57.310 --> 33:58.793
You know man,
I spent years-

33:58.827 --> 34:01.344
blaming you for everything
that went wrong in my life.

34:03.586 --> 34:05.275
Well the part of me
that's still your friend-

34:05.310 --> 34:07.758
can't help but feel guilty
for how I things went down.

34:09.310 --> 34:12.034
I should have handled
them differently.

34:12.068 --> 34:13.000
I should have
protected you.

34:13.034 --> 34:14.689
Yeah, from myself.

34:15.931 --> 34:16.551
No.

34:16.586 --> 34:17.275
Fact is-

34:17.310 --> 34:18.379
you're a good
cop, Donny.

34:18.413 --> 34:19.827
You did what
you needed to do.

34:20.724 --> 34:23.586
You know I'm serious
about what I said before.

34:25.310 --> 34:26.275
I can help you.

34:27.931 --> 34:28.689
They found us.

34:29.689 --> 34:30.310
Stand back.

34:30.344 --> 34:31.241
Hey hey.

34:31.275 --> 34:31.965
Maybe it's your guys?

34:32.000 --> 34:32.827
No no.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.655
They would have
identified themselves.

34:37.862 --> 34:38.551
Okay listen.

34:38.586 --> 34:39.620
You need to get
out of here.

34:39.655 --> 34:40.275
Okay?

34:40.310 --> 34:41.103
Uh-

34:41.137 --> 34:42.379
I need you to keep
your head down.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.620
And stay as far away from
St. John's as possible.

34:44.655 --> 34:45.310
What about you?

34:45.344 --> 34:45.965
I'll be fine.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.103
I'll create a distraction-

34:47.137 --> 34:47.896
a diversion-

34:47.931 --> 34:49.034
give you some time
to escape okay?

34:49.068 --> 34:51.448
<i>Just- be safe.</i>

34:51.482 --> 34:52.413
You sure?

34:52.448 --> 34:53.172
I'm sure.

34:56.551 --> 34:57.862
You be safe partner.

34:57.896 --> 34:58.827
Okay?

34:59.931 --> 35:00.655
Go on.

35:40.310 --> 35:41.241
Okay.

35:41.344 --> 35:42.379
<i>Okay okay.</i>

35:42.482 --> 35:43.517
Okay.

35:43.551 --> 35:44.517
Where's Watson?

35:44.620 --> 35:45.689
He wasn't here
when I got here.

35:45.724 --> 35:46.758
I was just
stalling for time-

35:46.793 --> 35:48.172
until I could
get away.

35:48.206 --> 35:50.310
Knox isn't here to
keep you alive this time.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.827
Joe's phone and
wallet are in the car.

36:05.862 --> 36:06.965
<i>No sidearm?</i>

36:07.000 --> 36:07.724
No.

36:08.965 --> 36:12.137
Why abandon the car
out in the open like this?

36:12.172 --> 36:13.620
Maybe that wasn't
their intention.

36:13.655 --> 36:15.103
Maybe they had to
leave in a hurry.

36:15.137 --> 36:16.000
One of the
officers mentioned-

36:16.034 --> 36:17.551
they have a search
team en route.

36:17.586 --> 36:19.206
But these woods
are huge.

36:19.241 --> 36:20.482
That's going to
take some time.

36:20.517 --> 36:22.379
Good thing we have our own
search team ready to go.

36:22.413 --> 36:23.413
I'll take
that wallet.

36:23.896 --> 36:24.586
Hey pal.

36:26.137 --> 36:26.965
Get the scent.

36:28.206 --> 36:28.862
Track it.

36:31.482 --> 36:32.482
He's got something.

36:37.137 --> 36:38.206
Just take it easy.

36:38.793 --> 36:39.896
All right?

36:41.206 --> 36:44.206
You don't want any of the heat
that comes with killing a cop.

36:45.793 --> 36:46.655
Out here in the
middle of nowhere?

36:46.689 --> 36:47.689
Who's going to know?

36:48.068 --> 36:49.827
You know, you should
be thanking me.

36:50.206 --> 36:50.965
You know that?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.827
<i>If you had found
Watson already-</i>

36:52.862 --> 36:54.068
<i>Knox would
have shot him-</i>

36:54.103 --> 36:54.931
<i>killed him.</i>

36:54.965 --> 36:56.724
And what do
you think huh?

36:56.758 --> 36:59.103
Do you think he's just going to
just going to let you run off-

36:59.137 --> 37:00.517
and rat him out
to your uncle?

37:00.931 --> 37:01.655
What do you mean?

37:01.689 --> 37:02.758
<i>Greg come on.</i>

37:02.793 --> 37:03.793
It means he
would kill you.

37:03.827 --> 37:04.724
He'd kill you next.

37:05.241 --> 37:06.137
No.

37:06.620 --> 37:08.310
You're just saying
that to confuse me.

37:09.000 --> 37:09.862
<i>I'm done with you.</i>

37:11.241 --> 37:12.000
Ughh!

37:12.758 --> 37:13.448
Uhhh!

37:13.862 --> 37:14.758
Nice shot!

37:15.379 --> 37:16.068
<i>Give me that rope!</i>

37:19.620 --> 37:21.310
I thought I told you
to get out of here!

37:21.344 --> 37:22.862
Yeah when've I ever
listened to good sense?

37:23.689 --> 37:24.689
Well I've got
to tell you.

37:24.724 --> 37:25.689
It's good
to see you.

37:25.724 --> 37:27.172
I never thought I'd
hear you say that man.

37:29.862 --> 37:31.344
<i>Isn't this
a nice reunion.</i>

37:32.448 --> 37:34.172
Too bad I can't
stick around.

37:39.724 --> 37:40.551
We could talk
about this.

37:40.586 --> 37:41.275
Let's talk about this.

37:41.310 --> 37:41.965
No no no. No.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.241
I think I've
heard enough.

37:43.275 --> 37:43.896
Wait.

37:43.931 --> 37:45.000
Wait wait.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.724
It wasn't you who pawned
off the guitar, was it?

37:49.448 --> 37:50.379
Why do you
say that?

37:50.413 --> 37:51.758
<i>Well I mean
if it was-</i>

37:51.793 --> 37:52.793
then you must
have known-

37:52.827 --> 37:54.206
the police would be
back to investigate.

37:54.241 --> 37:56.172
<i>You would have been more careful
to hide the stolen record.</i>

37:57.724 --> 37:59.000
Who were you
working with?

38:00.931 --> 38:02.827
<i>Look Miss Harris.</i>

38:02.862 --> 38:03.965
If you cooperate-

38:04.241 --> 38:05.448
I mean, you can
make a deal.

38:05.482 --> 38:07.413
Probably get probation
instead of prison.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.000
<i>Why would you want
to defend the person-</i>

38:10.034 --> 38:12.310
foolish enough to lead the
police to your front door?

38:13.172 --> 38:13.931
That's-

38:15.620 --> 38:17.000
a good point.

38:19.793 --> 38:21.827
It was Clynburg's
son's idea.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.034
He knew his
dad was sick.

38:24.068 --> 38:25.793
And he didn't want
to see his inheritance-

38:25.827 --> 38:26.689
handed over
to a museum.

38:27.482 --> 38:29.758
Wait- so you
gave him access-

38:29.793 --> 38:31.000
to his Dad's unit
through your kitchen.

38:31.517 --> 38:32.689
Yeah.

38:32.724 --> 38:34.655
He packed up everything
in here and left with it.

38:34.689 --> 38:37.103
<i>One of the other owners was
moving out at the same time.</i>

38:37.137 --> 38:39.448
So no one noticed that
he was carrying out boxes.

38:39.482 --> 38:41.482
What about the
Clifford Brown record?

38:43.034 --> 38:44.275
It's all I wanted.

38:47.896 --> 38:49.241
<i>You risked
a lot for it.</i>

38:51.724 --> 38:53.689
The curse of
being a collector.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.896
Just knowing
I have it-

38:57.827 --> 39:00.413
makes me feel like I've
accomplished something.

39:01.103 --> 39:02.206
And if I
didn't take it-

39:03.206 --> 39:05.379
it would have been lost
to the world forever.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.344
You know, Miss Harris.

39:09.379 --> 39:13.379
I still have
to take you in.

39:14.172 --> 39:15.172
I know.

39:15.344 --> 39:17.482
Just give
me a minute.

39:18.241 --> 39:19.068
Sure.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.344
This is a long time
coming, Watson.

39:31.379 --> 39:33.517
<i>I'm going
to enjoy this.</i>

39:34.137 --> 39:35.206
<i>But first-</i>

39:35.241 --> 39:36.586
you get to watch.

39:37.103 --> 39:40.137
I'm going to make an exception
to my <i>no cop</i> policy-

39:40.172 --> 39:42.586
<i>as a treat to me.</i>

39:42.620 --> 39:44.793
<i>That's a
bad move, Knox.</i>

39:45.793 --> 39:46.448
Bad career move.

39:46.482 --> 39:47.379
You said so yourself.

39:47.413 --> 39:49.448
Except when Watson disappears-

39:49.482 --> 39:50.827
it's going to look
like he did it.

39:50.862 --> 39:53.034
<i>It's a sad story.</i>

39:53.068 --> 39:54.172
Really.

39:56.482 --> 39:57.137
No!

40:06.241 --> 40:06.862
<i>Hey!</i>

40:06.896 --> 40:07.931
Wow.

40:08.931 --> 40:11.000
He just bought you ten
extra seconds of life.

40:12.586 --> 40:13.965
What a bonus!

40:22.862 --> 40:23.965
What the hell
was that?

40:24.620 --> 40:26.655
<i>That's a
friend of mine.</i>

40:26.689 --> 40:27.724
And I'd like
to think that-

40:28.586 --> 40:30.655
he's too close for your
cover-up plan to work.

41:07.413 --> 41:08.103
<i>Joe!</i>

41:08.137 --> 41:08.965
<i>Charlie!</i>

41:09.206 --> 41:09.827
<i>Right here.</i>

41:11.482 --> 41:12.724
<i>Sarah hey!</i>

41:14.241 --> 41:16.103
Didn't I tell you I'd
take a bullet for you?

41:16.655 --> 41:18.448
<i>Yeah,
you told me.</i>

41:18.482 --> 41:19.379
Help's on the way.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.137
The bullet didn't
hit anything vital.

41:21.172 --> 41:22.586
Okay just keep
pressure on it.

41:22.689 --> 41:23.482
Okay.

41:23.517 --> 41:24.413
See?

41:24.448 --> 41:25.655
Didn't I tell you
I'd save your life?

41:25.689 --> 41:26.379
Yeah, you told me.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.793
Where the hell did
that dog come from?

41:32.379 --> 41:33.517

41:33.551 --> 41:34.551

42:14.068 --> 42:14.724
Hey!

42:14.758 --> 42:16.655
So what happens
with Watson?

42:16.758 --> 42:19.275
Well because of his testimony
against the Patricks-

42:19.310 --> 42:21.172
<i>the Crown should put him
in witness protection.</i>

42:21.206 --> 42:23.137
You help plant that
idea with the Crown?

42:23.172 --> 42:25.517
Yeah well he was my
former partner Charlie.

42:25.551 --> 42:27.551
If I don't have his
back, who will?

42:27.586 --> 42:28.965
Kind of like you
had my back today!

42:29.000 --> 42:29.620
Huh Rex?

42:35.068 --> 42:36.034
And as for you-

42:36.068 --> 42:38.344
<i>I read your report.</i>

42:38.379 --> 42:40.758
I can't believe you went
and questioned a suspect-

42:40.793 --> 42:41.482
without back-up.

42:41.793 --> 42:42.413
I did.

42:42.448 --> 42:43.551
Yeah I did.

42:43.586 --> 42:45.448
But I mean- to be fair, you
did ask me to handle it.

42:52.862 --> 42:53.931
Well I'm
proud of you.

42:53.965 --> 42:55.172
<i>You did good work.</i>

42:56.068 --> 42:57.068
<i>Agreed.</i>

42:57.103 --> 42:58.965
Rex and I are going
to have to step it up-

42:59.000 --> 43:00.206
now that you're
gunning for our jobs.

43:00.241 --> 43:01.103
You know what?

43:01.137 --> 43:02.827
I give it a couple
of months tops.

43:02.862 --> 43:03.724
What do you
think Rex?

43:03.758 --> 43:04.482
You and me?

43:04.517 --> 43:05.344
Hey pal?

43:07.758 --> 43:08.862
<i>Yeah.</i>
