00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:28.446
[rain pattering]

00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:58.434
[rhythmic thudding]

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:05.733
[thudding intensifies]

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:16.410
- [thudding stops]
- [sighs]

00:01:18.663 --> 00:01:19.914
[chairman] Dr. Oppenheimer.

00:01:21.624 --> 00:01:22.833
Dr. Oppenheimer.

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:27.838
As we begin, I believe you have
a statement to read into the record.

00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:30.925
Yes, Your Honor.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.219
[board member] We're not judges, Doctor.

00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:34.971
No.

00:01:35.054 --> 00:01:36.264
[quietly] Of course.

00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:43.854
Members of the security board.

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:48.484
The so-called and derogatory information
in your indictment of me

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.152
cannot be fairly understood,

00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:53.698
except in the context of my life
and my work.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.242
[Senate aide] How long did he testify?

00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:58.786
Honestly, I forget.

00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:02.164
The whole hearing took a month.

00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:03.457
An ordeal.

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:06.544
I've only read the transcripts, but...
[clears throat]

00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:10.089
Who'd want to justify their whole life?

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:12.800
- You weren't there?
- As chairman, I wasn't allowed to be.

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:15.011
Are they really going to ask about it?

00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.221
It was years ago.

00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:18.889
- Four years ago. [chuckles]
- Five.

00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:21.559
Oppenheimer still divides America.

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.936
The committee is gonna want to know
where you stood.

00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:28.316
Senator Thurmond asked me to say
not to feel that you're on trial.

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.402
Aw. Funny,
I didn't till you just said that.

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:32.570
Really, Mr. Strauss...

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:33.738
It's Admiral.

00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:36.532
Admiral Strauss. This is a formality.

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:38.826
President Eisenhower has asked you
to be in his cabinet.

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.721
Senate really has no choice
but to confirm you.

00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:43.080
And if they bring up Oppenheimer?

00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:45.499
When they bring up Oppenheimer,
you answer honestly.

00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:47.793
No senator can deny you did your duty.

00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:49.670
It'll be uncomfortable. [chuckles]

00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:52.214
Who'd want to justify their whole life?

00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:54.300
[loud chattering]

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.178
[shutter clicks]

00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:00.056
[prosecutor]
Why did you leave the United States?

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:05.353
I, uh, wanted to study the new physics.

00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:06.896
[chairman] Was there nowhere here?

00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:10.733
I thought Berkeley had the leading
theoretical physics department.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.402
Yes. Once I had built it.

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:15.029
But first I had to go to Europe.

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:18.449
I went to Cambridge
to study under Patrick Blackett.

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:20.910
Were you happier there than in America?

00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:23.120
- Happier?
- Yes.

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:28.751
No.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:30.002
No, I, uh...

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:34.757
I was homesick, urn,

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:37.718
emotionally immature,

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:44.100
troubled by visions of a hidden universe.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.022
[energy pulsing]

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.862
Useless in the lab.

00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:58.572
[glass shattering]

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:04.036
Christ, Oppenheimer.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.163
Have you had any sleep?

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:09.291
Start again.

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:11.585
I need to go to the lecture, sir.

00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:13.212
Why?

00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:15.089
It's Niels Bohr.

00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:19.218
I'd completely forgot.

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:22.263
All right. [clears throat] Let's go.

00:04:24.557 --> 00:04:27.351
Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer.
You finish coating those plates.

00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:28.978
[students chattering, laughing]

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:03.929
[cupboard door closes]

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:11.812
[Bohr]
Quantum physics is not a step forward.

00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:15.691
It is a new way to understand reality.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.568
Einstein's opened the door.

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:21.906
Now we are peering through,
seeing a world inside our world.

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:27.244
A world of energy and paradox
that not everyone can accept.

00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:37.296
[energy pulsing]

00:05:57.942 --> 00:05:59.401
[bell tolling]

00:06:03.656 --> 00:06:05.449
[students chattering]

00:06:09.954 --> 00:06:12.122
- Yeah... Are you all right?
- [breathing heavily]

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.334
Niels, meet J. Robert Oppenheimer.

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:17.503
What's the J stand for?

00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:18.921
Nothing, apparently.

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.507
You were at my lecture.
You asked the only good question.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.190
[Blackett] No one's denying his insight.

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.619
It's his laboratory work
that leaves a little to be desired.

00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:27.948
I heard you give the same lectu...

00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:30.474
At Harvard, yes,
and you asked the same question.

00:06:30.558 --> 00:06:31.642
Why ask again?

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:32.977
Hadn't liked your answer.

00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:36.230
Did you like it better yesterday?

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:37.356
A lot.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:41.944
You can lift the stone without being ready
for the snake that's revealed.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.154
Now it seems you're ready.

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:45.698
But you don't enjoy the lab?

00:06:46.782 --> 00:06:49.493
So get out of Cambridge
with its beakers and potions.

00:06:49.577 --> 00:06:52.204
Go somewhere they'll let you think.

00:06:53.205 --> 00:06:54.290
[whispers] Where?

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:56.750
GÃ¶ttingen.

00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:58.711
- Born.
- Born.

00:06:58.794 --> 00:07:00.504
Get to Germany. Study under Max Born.

00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:03.132
Learn the ways of theory.

00:07:03.215 --> 00:07:04.258
I'll send word.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.136
- Wormhole.
- [apple clatters]

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:09.930
How's your mathematics?

00:07:10.014 --> 00:07:12.016
Not good enough
for the physicist he wants to be.

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:14.351
Algebra's like sheet music.

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:16.604
The important thing isn't
"can you read music?"

00:07:16.687 --> 00:07:18.188
It's "can you hear it?"

00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:20.608
Can you hear the music, Robert?

00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:22.860
Yes, I can.

00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:50.054
[no audible dialogue]

00:08:40.396 --> 00:08:42.314
[rumbling]

00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:45.609
[rhythmic thudding]

00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:00.791
The senator from Wyoming.

00:09:01.834 --> 00:09:02.918
Admiral Strauss,

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.422
I'm interested in your relationship
with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:08.215
You met him in 1947?

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:09.758
Correct.

00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:13.053
You were commissioner
of the Atomic Energy Commission?

00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:18.267
I was, but I actually met Robert
in my capacity as board member

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.728
of the Institute for Advanced Study
at Princeton,

00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:23.772
because after the war
he was world renowned

00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:25.065
as the great man of physics,

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:29.319
and I was determined
to get him to run the Institute.

00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:41.790
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

00:09:41.874 --> 00:09:42.958
Mr. Strauss.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:45.252
It's pronounced "straws."

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.795
Oh-ppenheimer, Oppenheimer.

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.679
Whatever way you say it,
they know I'm Jewish.

00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:49.882
[chuckles]

00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:52.885
I'm president of Temple Emanu-El
in Manhattan.

00:09:52.968 --> 00:09:55.554
"Straws" is just
the Southern pronunciation.

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.723
Anyway, welcome to the Institute.

00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.391
I think you could be very happy here.

00:09:59.475 --> 00:10:01.518
Yes, well, you'll love the commute.

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:04.146
The position comes with that house
for you and your wife,

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.106
and your... Is it two children?

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.191
Yes, two.

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:10.152
I'm a great admirer of your work.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.529
And you're a physicist by training,
Mr. Strauss?

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:14.698
I'm sorry, common room, four o'clock tea.

00:10:14.782 --> 00:10:17.493
No, I'm not trained in physics
or anything else.

00:10:17.576 --> 00:10:18.619
I'm a self-made man.

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:21.205
- Ah. I can relate to that.
- Really?

00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:23.081
Yes, my father was one.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:26.960
And this would be your office.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:33.926
[birds chirping]

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.347
I'm told he's there most afternoons.

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.557
You know, I've always wondered

00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:43.602
why you didn't involve him
in the Manhattan Project.

00:10:45.938 --> 00:10:48.106
Greatest scientific mind of our time.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.316
Of his time.

00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:52.277
Einstein published
his Theory of Relativity

00:10:52.361 --> 00:10:54.988
more than 40 years ago now.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.659
But never embraced
the quantum world it revealed.

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.160
"God doesn't play dice."

00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:02.287
Precisely.

00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:05.082
You never thought of studying
physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.793
I had offers, but I chose to sell shoes.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.712
Lewis Strauss was once
a lowly shoe salesman.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.841
No, just a shoe salesman.

00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:15.175
[chuckles]

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.221
I'd love to introduce you.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.430
No need.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.724
I have known him for years.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.580
Albert.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.210
What was that?

00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:54.172
What did you say to him?

00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:57.676
Oh, he's fine.

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:04.308
Mr. Strauss, there are things in my past
you ought to be aware of.

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:07.686
Well, as chairman of the AEC,
I have access to your security file.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:08.770
I've read it.

00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:10.397
- You're not worried?
- No.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.792
Why would I be worried after everything
you've done for your country?

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:14.776
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.820
Well, the purpose of this institute

00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:19.197
is to provide
a haven for independent minds.

00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:21.408
That's you.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.285
You are the man for the job.

00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:25.871
Well, then I'll consider it.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:28.040
I'll see you at the AEC meeting tomorrow.

00:12:31.335 --> 00:12:32.753
[scoffs]

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.422
This is one of the most prestigious
appointments in the country.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.633
Yes, with a great commute.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.760
That's why I'm considering it.

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:44.973
[McGee] So, Dr. Oppenheimer brought
your attention to his past associations

00:12:45.057 --> 00:12:46.475
before you appointed him?

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:49.269
- Yes.
- And they didn't concern you?

00:12:49.353 --> 00:12:52.940
Just then I was entirely consumed
with what he must have said to Einstein

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:55.692
- to sour him on me.
- [gallery laughing]

00:12:58.195 --> 00:12:59.196
But later?

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.740
Well, we all know what happened later.

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.784
[prosecutor]
Doctor, your time in Europe,

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.912
you seemed to meet with a wide range
of other countries' physicists.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:07.996
Yes, that's right.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.373
Any Russians?

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:12.376
None that spring to mind.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.962
If you'll just allow me
to continue with my statement...

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:18.465
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample opportunity
to cross-examine.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:24.388
After GÃ¶ttingen,
I moved on to Leiden in Holland,

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:26.390
where [ first met Isidor Rabi.

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:28.558
[Rabi clears throat] Excuse me.

00:13:33.397 --> 00:13:35.691
A Yank, lecturing on the new physics?

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:36.775
This I have to hear.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.944
I'm an American myself.

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.153
How surprising.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.740
Let me know if you need any help
with the English.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.869
[students laughing]

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:53.208
[speaking Dutch]

00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.172
Wait, what's he saying?

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:11.560
No, thank you.

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:13.478
It's a long way to Zurich.

00:14:13.562 --> 00:14:16.282
You get any skinnier, we're gonna
lose you between the seat cushions.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:17.983
I'm Rabi.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.359
Oppenheimer.

00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:21.403
I caught your lecture on molecules.

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:22.696
Caught some of it.

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:25.907
We're a couple of New York Jews.
How do you know Dutch?

00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:28.869
Well, I thought I'd better learn it
when I got here this semester.

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:32.164
You learned enough Dutch in six weeks
to give a lecture on quantum mechanics?

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:33.707
Wanted to challenge myself.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.084
Quantum physics wasn't challenging enough.

00:14:36.168 --> 00:14:37.753
- Schvitzer.
- Schvitzer?

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.337
- Show-off.
- [chuckles]

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.631
Dutch in six weeks,
but you never learned Yiddish?

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.675
They don't speak it so much
my side of the park.

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:45.177
Screw you.

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.764
- You homesick?
- Oh, you know it.

00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:52.768
Ever get the feeling our kind
isn't entirely welcome here?

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:53.852
Physicists?

00:14:54.478 --> 00:14:55.395
That's funny.

00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:57.022
Not in the department.

00:14:57.606 --> 00:14:58.774
They're all Jewish too.

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:01.985
Eat.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.823
There's a German you have to seek out.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:09.451
- Heisenberg.
- Right.

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.247
[Heisenberg speaking German]

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:23.590
One might be led to the presumption
that behind the quantum world,

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:27.469
there still hides a real world
in which causality holds,

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:31.890
but such speculations seem to us,
to say it explicitly, fruitless.

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.850
Thank you. Have a great day.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.398
- Werner. Wonderful.
- Thank you.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:42.234
Dr. Oppenheimer.

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:46.029
Oppenheimer, yes.
I liked your paper on molecules.

00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:47.531
Probably because you inspired it.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:50.254
If I inspire anything else, let me know.
We could publish together.

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:51.952
I have to get back to America.

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.078
Why?

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.956
There's no one there
taking quantum mechanics seriously.

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:57.624
That's exactly why.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.127
He's pining for the canyons of Manhattan.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.504
Canyons of New Mexico.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:03.630
You're from New Mexico?

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:07.217
No. New York, but my brother and I
have a ranch outside Santa Fe.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.803
That's the America I miss right now.

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:13.140
- Then it's best you get home, cowboys.
- [Oppenheimer, Rabi chuckle]

00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:14.224
That's him.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.185
No, me and horses? I don't think so.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.604
Nice to meet you.

00:16:21.565 --> 00:16:23.733
Did you ever encounter Heisenberg again?

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:25.861
Not in person, no, but, uh...

00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:29.990
you might say our paths crossed.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.951
On returning to America,

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:35.954
I accepted positions at both Caltech
and up at Berkeley.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:36.079
[people chattering]

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.956
[people chattering]

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:46.339
[equipment clattering]

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:55.473
[sighs]

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.230
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.401
- You must be Oppenheimer.
- Yes.

00:17:06.902 --> 00:17:09.154
I hear you want to start
a school of quantum theory.

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:10.989
I am starting it. Next door.

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.240
They put you in there?

00:17:12.324 --> 00:17:15.577
I asked for it. Wanted to be close
to you experimentalists.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.329
Theory will get you only so far, huh?

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:19.332
We're building a machine
to accelerate electrons.

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:20.415
Magnificent.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:21.917
Would you like to help?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.835
Build it? Oh, no. [chuckles]

00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:24.920
No, no.

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:27.672
But I am working on theories
I'd like to test with it.

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.049
When do you start teaching?

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:30.425
I've got my first in an hour.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:32.469
- Seminar?
- Pupil.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.347
One student? That's it?

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.558
I'm teaching something
no one here has dreamt of.

00:17:38.642 --> 00:17:40.620
But once people start hearing
what you can do with it...

00:17:40.644 --> 00:17:42.103
There's no going back.

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:43.563
[door opens]

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:47.108
- Oh. I must have missed the...
- Mr. Lomanitz?

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:48.193
Nah...

00:17:49.653 --> 00:17:50.654
Yeah.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:51.738
Yes, this is it.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:53.657
Please. Take a seat.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:55.909
[clears throat]

00:17:58.954 --> 00:18:00.580
What do you know
about quantum mechanics?

00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:03.583
I have a grasp on the basics.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:05.043
Then you're doing it wrong.

00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:08.171
Is light made up of particles or waves?

00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:10.840
Quantum mechanics says it's both.
How could it be both?

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.384
- It can't.
- It can't.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.094
But it is.

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:17.514
It's paradoxical, and yet, it works.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:25.855
Now...

00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:29.734
Thank you.

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:31.486
Mr. Lomanitz.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:32.570
You're gonna be okay.

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.197
Mr. Snyder.

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:36.324
Now let's consider a star.

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:37.951
A star.

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:39.953
A vast furnace burning in outer space,

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.580
fire pushing outwards
against its own gravity.

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:43.832
Balanced.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.501
But if that furnace cools

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.588
and gravity starts winning, it contracts.

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:51.756
Density increases.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.467
Correct. Increasing gravity.

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:56.303
- Increasing density.
- And?

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:59.431
It's a vicious cycle until...
What's the limit here?

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.226
[chuckles] I don't know.
See where the math takes us.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.870
I guarantee it's somewhere
no one's been before.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.396
Me?

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:08.940
Yes, you. Your math is better than mine.

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.859
[students laughing]

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.652
[Bartlett] Dr. Oppenheimer's file

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.405
contained details
of his activities in Berkeley.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:19.159
Why would they have started a file
on Dr. Oppenheimer before the war?

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:22.287
Well, you'd have to ask Mr. Hoover.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.164
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.958
Uh, my assumption is

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:32.714
that it was connected to his,
uh, left-wing political activities.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.424
[door opens]

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.761
You shouldn't let them bring up politics
in the classroom, Oppie.

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:38.845
I wrote that.

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:42.057
Lawrence,
you embrace the revolution in physics.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.100
Can't you see it everywhere else?

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:46.269
Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx.

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:49.064
Well, this is America, Oppie.
We had our revolution.

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:53.109
Seriously, keep it out of the lab.

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:57.655
Well, out of the lab, my landlady
is having a discussion group tonight.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:58.740
Interested?

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:00.909
I have sampled
the Berkeley political scene.

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:05.372
It's all just philosophy postgrads
and communists talking integration.

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.040
You don't care about integration?

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:08.875
I want to vote for it, not talk about it.

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.210
Especially on a Friday.

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:11.336
Come on. Let's eat.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:12.921
I'm meeting my brother there.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:17.384
[Bartlett] And how would these activities
have come to the attention of the FBI?

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:19.469
Well, if I remember correctly,

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:23.640
the FBI was taking license plates
outside suspected communist gatherings,

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.392
and his name popped up.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.402
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry.

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:37.070
- Frank.
- Robert.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.697
Uh, you remember Jackie.

00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:40.782
Evening.

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:42.700
Let's go.

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:45.870
[people chattering]

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.123
[student] Robert.

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:50.500
I want you to meet Chevalier.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.628
Dr. Haakon Chevalier,
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:54.712
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:56.756
- This is my little brother, Frank.
- Hello.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.383
- And this is...
- Still Jackie.

00:20:58.466 --> 00:20:59.509
Hello, Still Jackie.

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.553
Chevalier, you're in languages?

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:03.304
And your reputation precedes you.

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:04.389
What have you heard?

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:06.683
That you're teaching
a radical new approach to physics

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:10.061
I have no chance of understanding,
but I hadn't heard you're a Party member.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:11.688
- I'm not.
- Not yet.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.208
Frank and I are thinking of joining.
Just the other day, I was...

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:15.567
I support a range of causes.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:16.734
The Spanish Civil War?

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:20.155
A democratic republic being overthrown
by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:23.992
Our government. They think that socialism
is a bigger threat than fascism.

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:26.786
Not for long. Look at what the Nazis
are doing to the Jews.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.414
I send funds to colleagues in Germany
to emigrate.

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:31.124
I have to do something.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.878
My own work is so abstract.

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.465
- What are you working on?
- What happens to stars when they die.

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:39.591
Do stars die?

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:44.429
Well, if they do,
they cool, then collapse.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:49.142
In fact, the bigger the star,
the more violent its demise.

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:53.104
Their gravity gets so concentrated,
it swallows everything.

00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.273
Everything, even light.

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:56.608
Can that really happen?

00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:58.318
The math says it can.

00:21:58.401 --> 00:22:01.488
If we can get published, then perhaps
one day an astronomer finds one.

00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:05.366
But right now, all I have is theory,
which can't impact people's lives.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.494
Well, if you're going
to send money to Spain,

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:08.995
do it through the Communist Party.

00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:11.039
They can get it to the front lines.

00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:12.415
Mary sent me with these.

00:22:13.374 --> 00:22:14.375
I'm Jean.

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:16.294
Robert.

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:17.420
Haakon Chevalier.

00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:19.422
The union meeting at Serber's last month.

00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:20.798
Right, right, yes.

00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:22.217
Oh, thank you.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.612
[Chevalier]
Robert here says he's not a communist.

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:26.763
Well, then he doesn't
know enough about it.

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:29.516
I've read Das Kapital, all three volumes.

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:30.600
Does that count?

00:22:30.683 --> 00:22:32.894
It would make you better read
than most party members.

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:36.523
It's turgid stuff. There's some thinking,
"Ownership is theft."

00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:37.649
"Property."

00:22:37.732 --> 00:22:39.067
"Property"?

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.401
"Property," not "ownership."

00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:42.278
I'm sorry,
I read it in the original German.

00:22:42.362 --> 00:22:43.738
[chuckles]

00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:45.365
- [Chevalier] Well...
- [glasses clink]

00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:47.116
It's not about the book.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.826
It's about the ideas.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.453
And you sound uncommitted.

00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:53.831
I'm committed to thinking freely
about how to improve our world.

00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:56.626
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:59.587
You're a physicist.
You pick and choose rules?

00:22:59.671 --> 00:23:03.800
Or do you use the discipline
to channel your energies into progress?

00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:05.760
I like a little wiggle room.

00:23:06.803 --> 00:23:08.763
Do you always toe the party line?

00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:12.183
I like my wiggle room too.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.355
[panting]

00:23:22.944 --> 00:23:23.945
- What?
- [laughs]

00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:25.822
Wait, wait, wait.

00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:32.579
- Unexpected.
- What?

00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:34.080
For a physicist.

00:23:34.163 --> 00:23:36.624
You only have a shelf full of Freud?

00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:39.127
Well, actually, my background's more...

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.378
Jungian?

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.756
You know analysis?

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.135
When I was a postgrad at Cambridge,
I had a little trouble.

00:23:48.303 --> 00:23:49.304
I'll bite.

00:23:49.387 --> 00:23:50.930
I tried to poison my tutor.

00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:52.015
Did you hate him?

00:23:52.098 --> 00:23:53.516
I liked him very much.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.393
You just needed to get laid.

00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:56.936
Took my analyst two years,

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.147
and I don't think they ever put it
that succinctly.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:03.067
You have everyone convinced you're
more complicated than you actually are.

00:24:03.151 --> 00:24:04.986
We're all simple souls, I guess.

00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:06.279
I'm not.

00:24:09.157 --> 00:24:10.158
What's this?

00:24:10.241 --> 00:24:11.826
Sanskrit.

00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:13.077
You can read this?

00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:14.746
I'm learning.

00:24:19.751 --> 00:24:20.752
Read this.

00:24:22.503 --> 00:24:26.257
Well, in this part,
Vishnu reveals his multi-armed self...

00:24:26.341 --> 00:24:27.425
No.

00:24:28.593 --> 00:24:30.178
Read the words.

00:24:33.848 --> 00:24:36.059
"And now I am become Death."

00:24:40.188 --> 00:24:42.190
[thunder rumbling]

00:24:42.273 --> 00:24:43.816
"The destroyer of worlds."

00:24:46.486 --> 00:24:48.112
[wind whistling]

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.640
[Oppenheimer] This'll do.

00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:19.519
[wind howling]

00:25:22.313 --> 00:25:23.606
It'll break before dawn.

00:25:24.107 --> 00:25:27.485
Air cools overnight.
Just before dawn, it breaks.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.072
Come on. Come on.

00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:38.037
- [chuckles]
- [Lawrence sighs]

00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:40.164
[grunts] So...

00:25:40.248 --> 00:25:41.624
I'm getting married.

00:25:41.708 --> 00:25:43.918
- Frank. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:45.002
To Jackie?

00:25:45.086 --> 00:25:47.547
- Yeah, to Jackie.
- [Oppenheimer clears throat]

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.715
The waitress.

00:25:48.798 --> 00:25:50.633
Oppie, you're right. It's lettin' up.

00:25:50.717 --> 00:25:52.552
I'm gonna go see if there's any stars.

00:25:52.635 --> 00:25:56.889
All your talk about the common man,
but Jackie's not good enough for you, hmm?

00:25:57.807 --> 00:26:00.184
We join the Party,
and you can't hide your disapproval, why?

00:26:00.268 --> 00:26:02.228
Is that because that's supposed to be
your thing?

00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:03.671
I haven't joined the Party, Frank.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.399
And I don't think she should have
convinced you to either.

00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:08.025
Half of the faculty is communist.

00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:09.110
Not that half.

00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:13.322
I'm your brother, Frank,
and I want you to be cautious.

00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:14.606
And I want to wring your neck.

00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:20.163
I won't live my life
afraid to make a mistake.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:25.418
You're happy, I'm happy.

00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:28.254
So then I'm happy you're happy
that I'm happy.

00:26:33.301 --> 00:26:36.596
I feel like I could see one of those
dark stars that you're working on.

00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:39.557
You can't. That's the whole point.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.726
Their gravity swallows light.

00:26:42.643 --> 00:26:44.854
It's like a kind of hole in space.

00:26:45.855 --> 00:26:47.064
Is Frank okay?

00:26:47.148 --> 00:26:49.817
Yes. He just has a shitty brother.

00:26:50.777 --> 00:26:52.153
It is special here.

00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:55.990
When I was a kid,

00:26:57.283 --> 00:26:58.826
I thought if I could find a way

00:27:00.411 --> 00:27:04.582
to combine physics and New Mexico,

00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:06.334
my life would be perfect.

00:27:06.417 --> 00:27:07.543
[chuckles]

00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:10.338
- Little remote for that.
- Yes.

00:27:10.838 --> 00:27:12.173
Let's get some sleep.

00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:17.178
That mesa we saw today,
one of my favorite places in the world.

00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:19.222
Tomorrow we'll climb it.

00:27:19.764 --> 00:27:21.098
[Lawrence] What's it called?

00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:23.351
[Oppenheimer] Los Alamos.

00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:29.232
I didn't expect to see you today.

00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:32.360
Do I have to make an appointment?

00:27:33.152 --> 00:27:34.237
[store bell jingles]

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.906
- Hey! Hey, get back here!
- Alvarez?

00:27:43.371 --> 00:27:45.456
[Alvarez] Oppie! Oppie!

00:27:46.207 --> 00:27:47.708
[Oppenheimer] What? What is it?

00:27:48.209 --> 00:27:49.919
They've done it. They've done it.

00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:52.922
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.
They split the uranium nucleus.

00:27:54.257 --> 00:27:55.633
[Lawrence] How?

00:27:56.884 --> 00:27:58.719
Bombarded it with neutrons.

00:27:58.803 --> 00:28:01.472
It's a nuclear fission.
They did it, they split the atom.

00:28:01.556 --> 00:28:02.765
It's not possible.

00:28:09.355 --> 00:28:10.898
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

00:28:17.697 --> 00:28:19.615
See? Can't be done.

00:28:20.867 --> 00:28:22.076
[Lawrence] Very elegant.

00:28:22.827 --> 00:28:24.120
Quite clear.

00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:26.289
- There's just one problem.
- Where?

00:28:26.956 --> 00:28:28.040
Next door.

00:28:28.708 --> 00:28:29.709
Alvarez did it.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:31.919
But then look,

00:28:32.962 --> 00:28:35.506
these fission pulses, they're massive.

00:28:36.173 --> 00:28:39.594
I've seen 30 of these
in the past ten minutes.

00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:42.179
Theory will take you only so far.

00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:45.308
During the process,

00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:50.897
extra neutrons boil off, which could
be used to split other uranium atoms.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.066
Chain reaction.
You're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.945
You, me, and every other physicist
around the world who's seen the news.

00:28:59.405 --> 00:29:00.781
What? What are we all thinking?

00:29:01.824 --> 00:29:04.452
A bomb, Alvarez.

00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:06.913
A bomb.

00:29:08.414 --> 00:29:10.416
I told you, Robert,
no more fucking flowers.

00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:15.463
- 1 don't understand what you want from me.
- I don't want anything from you.

00:29:17.048 --> 00:29:20.635
- Well, you say that and then you call.
- Well, don't answer.

00:29:21.886 --> 00:29:23.012
I'll always answer.

00:29:28.643 --> 00:29:31.437
Fine. Just no more flowers.

00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:34.565
You're not coming?

00:29:36.484 --> 00:29:38.684
[Chevalier] You have to know
when you're beaten, Robert.

00:29:41.072 --> 00:29:42.448
It's not that simple, Hoke.

00:29:42.531 --> 00:29:45.010
- Chevalier, good to see you.
- [students] F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

00:29:45.034 --> 00:29:48.287
Barbara, good to see you,
and the illustrious Dr. Oppenheimer.

00:29:48.788 --> 00:29:50.456
- I'm Eltenton.
- Pleasure.

00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:51.624
Please, please.

00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:55.461
Might you say a word
about organized labor on campuses, yes?

00:29:55.544 --> 00:29:56.963
Coming through! Coming through.

00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:58.339
I work at Shell.

00:29:58.422 --> 00:30:00.716
We've signed up chemists,
we signed up engineers,

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.468
so why not scientists in academia?

00:30:02.551 --> 00:30:07.598
[students chanting]
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

00:30:07.682 --> 00:30:09.433
[cheering, applauding]

00:30:16.524 --> 00:30:18.275
Teachers are unionized.

00:30:18.776 --> 00:30:21.404
- Why not professors?
- Don't you have somewhere to be?

00:30:21.487 --> 00:30:24.281
Lawrence, academics have rights too.

00:30:24.365 --> 00:30:26.242
Look, it's not that.
I've got a group coming.

00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:28.160
Oh. I'll sit in.

00:30:28.244 --> 00:30:29.286
Not this one.

00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:32.790
[door opens]

00:30:35.835 --> 00:30:38.879
Richard. Dr. Bush.
What brings you two up north?

00:30:48.639 --> 00:30:51.559
Richard, you tell Ruth
I'll be down to Pasadena Thursday.

00:30:57.398 --> 00:30:58.774
[sighs]

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.779
Your paper on black holes is in!

00:31:05.448 --> 00:31:07.283
Where's Hartland?

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:09.452
Get Hartland. Get Hartland.

00:31:09.535 --> 00:31:13.164
September 1st, 1939.
The world's gonna remember this day.

00:31:13.247 --> 00:31:14.582
[chuckles]

00:31:14.665 --> 00:31:16.667
Oh, Hartland. Our paper, it's in print.

00:31:16.751 --> 00:31:18.627
We've been upstaged.

00:31:21.922 --> 00:31:23.674
[Oppenheimer]
During the Battle of Britain,

00:31:23.758 --> 00:31:26.677
I found myself
increasingly out of sympathy

00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:30.890
with the policy of neutrality
that communists advocated.

00:31:30.973 --> 00:31:34.060
But after Hitler invaded Russia
and we became allies,

00:31:34.143 --> 00:31:36.479
these communist sympathies,
did they return?

00:31:36.562 --> 00:31:37.562
No.

00:31:38.355 --> 00:31:42.526
I need to make clear
that my changing views on Russia

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.988
did not mean a sharp break
from those who held different views.

00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:48.365
For a year or two,
and during a previous marriage,

00:31:48.449 --> 00:31:51.660
my wife Kitty had been
a Communist Party member.

00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:54.413
[guests chattering, laughing]

00:31:55.706 --> 00:31:57.833
This way.
This is where I keep the good stuff.

00:31:57.917 --> 00:31:59.710
I thought this was the Tolmans' house.

00:31:59.794 --> 00:32:01.712
I live with them while I'm at Caltech.

00:32:01.796 --> 00:32:04.715
- Do you two need anything?
- [Oppenheimer] We're good, Ruthie.

00:32:05.966 --> 00:32:08.677
So, you're a biologist.

00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:12.515
Well, somehow
I have graduated to housewife.

00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:16.143
Can you explain quantum mechanics to me?
Seems baffling.

00:32:16.227 --> 00:32:17.728
Yes, it is.

00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:22.566
Well, this glass, this drink,

00:32:23.692 --> 00:32:27.363
this counter top, uh, our bodies,

00:32:28.906 --> 00:32:30.074
all of it.

00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:33.410
It's mostly empty space.

00:32:33.494 --> 00:32:36.539
Groupings of tiny energy waves
bound together.

00:32:36.622 --> 00:32:37.623
By what?

00:32:37.706 --> 00:32:41.460
Forces of attraction strong enough
to convince us

00:32:41.544 --> 00:32:45.965
that matter is solid,
stop my body passing through yours.

00:32:52.138 --> 00:32:53.639
[chattering]

00:32:58.727 --> 00:33:00.271
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

00:33:00.855 --> 00:33:01.855
Not very.

00:33:04.066 --> 00:33:07.736
There is someone that I feel...

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.155
Does she feel the same way?

00:33:09.238 --> 00:33:10.614
Sometimes.

00:33:11.574 --> 00:33:12.908
Not enough.

00:33:14.243 --> 00:33:17.079
You know, I'm going to New Mexico.

00:33:17.163 --> 00:33:19.999
To my ranch, with friends.
You should come.

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:23.252
I meant with your husband.

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:24.378
Yes, you did.

00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:26.881
"Cause you know
it won't make a bit of difference.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.053
[Oppenheimer]
Why did you marry him?

00:33:33.137 --> 00:33:36.307
I was lost and he was kind.

00:33:38.642 --> 00:33:39.643
Lost?

00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:42.062
Well, my previous husband had died

00:33:42.146 --> 00:33:45.316
and at 28
I wasn't really ready to be a widow.

00:33:45.399 --> 00:33:46.817
Who was your first husband?

00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:50.112
Nobody. But my second husband
was Joe Dallet.

00:33:50.196 --> 00:33:52.615
He was, um, from money, like me,

00:33:52.698 --> 00:33:56.202
but he was a union organizer
in Youngstown, Ohio.

00:33:56.285 --> 00:33:57.411
Fell hard.

00:33:57.494 --> 00:33:58.871
[chuckles] How hard?

00:33:58.954 --> 00:34:01.683
Hard enough to spend the next four years
living off beans and pancakes,

00:34:01.707 --> 00:34:04.668
handing out the Daily Worker
at factory gates.

00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:07.546
By 36, I just told Joe
I couldn't take it anymore.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.132
Quit the Party.
A year later, I wanted him back.

00:34:10.216 --> 00:34:12.801
Him, not the Daily Worker.

00:34:12.885 --> 00:34:14.970
He said,
"Swell, I'll meet you on my way to Spain."

00:34:15.054 --> 00:34:16.454
He went to fight for the Loyalists?

00:34:16.513 --> 00:34:19.558
And then he went to the brigades
and I waited, and...

00:34:21.227 --> 00:34:24.647
Joe got himself killed first time
he popped his head outta the trench.

00:34:25.439 --> 00:34:27.816
Ideology got Joe killed. For nothing.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.693
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

00:34:29.777 --> 00:34:32.780
My husband offered both our futures
to stop one fascist bullet

00:34:32.863 --> 00:34:35.032
from embedding itself in a mudbank.

00:34:36.075 --> 00:34:38.327
That's the definition of nothing.

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:40.287
- Seems a little reductive.
- Pragmatic.

00:34:42.331 --> 00:34:43.624
Now here I am.

00:34:46.252 --> 00:34:47.836
Wherever the hell this is.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.554
I didn't want you to hear it
from anyone else.

00:35:00.516 --> 00:35:02.476
Least you didn't bring me flowers.

00:35:02.559 --> 00:35:03.727
[sniffles]

00:35:04.937 --> 00:35:06.272
[chuckles]

00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:12.319
We both know I'm not what you want, Jean.

00:35:13.654 --> 00:35:15.531
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

00:35:16.448 --> 00:35:17.449
No.

00:35:19.326 --> 00:35:21.370
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

00:35:23.038 --> 00:35:25.332
You knocked her up. Fast work.

00:35:25.416 --> 00:35:28.085
- Can't keep a good man down.
- [chuckles]

00:35:28.168 --> 00:35:29.378
I meant her.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.382
She knew what she wanted.
What about the husband?

00:35:33.465 --> 00:35:34.883
We talked.

00:35:34.967 --> 00:35:36.218
They're getting a divorce

00:35:36.302 --> 00:35:40.472
so we can get married
before she starts showing.

00:35:40.556 --> 00:35:42.057
How civilized.

00:35:44.018 --> 00:35:46.603
You idiot. This is your community.

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:50.274
You think the rules don't apply
to the golden boy?

00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:52.735
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

00:35:53.444 --> 00:35:57.072
Don't alienate the only people
in the world that understand what you do.

00:35:58.699 --> 00:36:00.326
One day you might need them.

00:36:00.409 --> 00:36:01.534
[students chanting] F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

00:36:01.535 --> 00:36:03.013
[students chanting] F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

00:36:03.037 --> 00:36:05.098
[Oppenheimer]
The Federation of Architects, Engineers,

00:36:05.122 --> 00:36:07.249
Chemists and Technicians.

00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:17.509
- Lomanitz, what do you get paid a month?
- That's not the point, Lawrence.

00:36:17.593 --> 00:36:22.431
What do any of you have in common
with farm laborers and dock workers?

00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:23.724
[Lomanitz] Plenty.

00:36:24.892 --> 00:36:26.935
Everybody out. Now!

00:36:31.523 --> 00:36:32.858
Not you.

00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:34.735
[footsteps departing]

00:36:36.487 --> 00:36:37.821
[door closes]

00:36:38.697 --> 00:36:39.698
What are you doing?

00:36:40.574 --> 00:36:43.410
- It's a trade union.
- Filled with communists.

00:36:43.494 --> 00:36:45.329
So? I haven't joined the Party.

00:36:45.412 --> 00:36:48.916
They won't let me bring you
onto the project because of this shit.

00:36:48.999 --> 00:36:51.293
They won't even let me tell you
what the project is.

00:36:51.377 --> 00:36:54.254
- Oh, I know what the project is.
- Oh, really?

00:36:54.338 --> 00:36:56.965
We've all heard about
Einstein and Szilard's letter to Roosevelt

00:36:57.049 --> 00:36:58.729
warning him the Germans could make a bomb,

00:36:58.759 --> 00:37:02.054
and I know what it means
for the Nazis to have a bomb.

00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:03.514
And I don't?

00:37:03.597 --> 00:37:06.642
It's not your people
they're herding into camps.

00:37:06.725 --> 00:37:07.851
It's mine.

00:37:08.602 --> 00:37:10.938
You think that I tell them
about your politics.

00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:14.793
The next time you're coming home
from a meeting,

00:37:14.817 --> 00:37:16.819
why don't you take a look
in the rear view mirror?

00:37:16.902 --> 00:37:21.782
Listen to the sounds on your phone line
and stop being so goddamn naive.

00:37:23.242 --> 00:37:24.576
Why would they care what I do?

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.831
Because you're not just self-important,
you're actually important.

00:37:32.292 --> 00:37:33.293
Okay.

00:37:34.336 --> 00:37:37.464
- I get it.
- If you could just be a little more...

00:37:37.548 --> 00:37:38.715
Pragmatic.

00:37:38.799 --> 00:37:40.759
I'll talk to Lomanitz,
I'll talk to the others.

00:37:40.843 --> 00:37:43.429
You don't have to worry.
It's done, Lawrence.

00:37:48.851 --> 00:37:50.185
Then welcome to the war.

00:37:50.936 --> 00:37:53.230
I filled out
my first security questionnaire

00:37:53.313 --> 00:37:56.525
and was informed that my involvement
with left-wing groups

00:37:56.608 --> 00:38:00.529
would not prove a bar
to my working on the atomic program.

00:38:00.612 --> 00:38:03.198
[Pastore]
Why were his communist associations

00:38:03.282 --> 00:38:06.118
not seen as a security risk
during the war?

00:38:06.201 --> 00:38:09.288
Senator, I can't possibly answer
for security clearance

00:38:09.371 --> 00:38:11.373
granted years before I ever met the man.

00:38:11.457 --> 00:38:13.417
Fine. What about after?

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.501
After the war,

00:38:14.585 --> 00:38:19.214
Dr. Oppenheimer was the most respected
scientific voice in the world.

00:38:19.298 --> 00:38:21.341
That's why I asked him
to run the Institute.

00:38:21.425 --> 00:38:24.303
That's why he advised
the Atomic Energy Commission.

00:38:24.386 --> 00:38:25.512
Simple as that.

00:38:26.096 --> 00:38:27.639
What are they accusing me of?

00:38:28.265 --> 00:38:31.768
I think they just wanna know what happened
between 1947 and 1954

00:38:31.852 --> 00:38:34.563
to change your mind
on Oppenheimer's security clearance.

00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:35.647
I didn't.

00:38:35.731 --> 00:38:37.441
I was chair of the AEC,

00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:40.903
but it wasn't me
that brought the charges against Robert.

00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:42.279
Who did?

00:38:42.362 --> 00:38:44.299
Some former staff member
of the Joint Congressional Committee.

00:38:44.323 --> 00:38:47.367
He was a rabid anti-communist
named Borden.

00:38:47.451 --> 00:38:49.661
He wrote to the FBI
demanding they take action.

00:38:49.745 --> 00:38:52.247
The FBI? Why not go to the AEC direct?

00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:54.833
Why get caught holding the knife yourself?

00:38:54.917 --> 00:38:56.710
What did Borden have against Oppenheimer?

00:38:56.793 --> 00:38:58.462
This was the McCarthy Era.

00:38:59.338 --> 00:39:02.674
People hounded out of jobs
for any hint of red.

00:39:02.758 --> 00:39:05.761
And then,
reading Oppenheimer's security file,

00:39:05.844 --> 00:39:08.847
his communist brother,
sister-in-law, fiancÃ©e,

00:39:08.931 --> 00:39:10.265
best friend, wife.

00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:12.768
That's before we even get
to the Chevalier incident.

00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:16.188
But how would Borden have access
to Oppenheimer's security file?

00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:18.190
Because somebody gave it to him.

00:39:19.191 --> 00:39:21.735
Somebody who wanted Robert silenced.

00:39:21.818 --> 00:39:23.820
- Who?
- [Strauss] Who knows?

00:39:23.904 --> 00:39:27.824
Robert didn't take care not to upset
the power brokers in Washington.

00:39:28.534 --> 00:39:31.286
His opinions on the atom became definitive

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:33.872
and he wasn't always patient
with us mere mortals.

00:39:37.668 --> 00:39:39.836
I came in for plenty of harsh treatment.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.298
There was an AEC vote

00:39:43.382 --> 00:39:45.801
on the export of isotopes to Norway,

00:39:45.884 --> 00:39:48.554
and they drafted in Robert
to make me look like a fool.

00:39:48.637 --> 00:39:51.616
[congressman] But, Dr. Oppenheimer,
we've already heard from Admiral Strauss

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.893
that these isotopes
could be useful to our enemies

00:39:54.977 --> 00:39:56.417
in the production of atomic weapons.

00:39:56.478 --> 00:39:59.648
Congressmen, you could use
a shovel in making atomic weapons.

00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:00.732
In fact, you do.

00:40:00.816 --> 00:40:03.860
You could use a bottle of beer
in making atomic weapons.

00:40:03.944 --> 00:40:05.320
In fact, you do.

00:40:05.404 --> 00:40:08.740
I say isotopes are less useful
than electronic components,

00:40:08.824 --> 00:40:11.994
- but more useful than a sandwich.
- [gallery laughs]

00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:16.301
[Strauss]
Genius is no guarantee of wisdom.

00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:19.793
How could this man
who saw so much be so blind?

00:40:20.961 --> 00:40:23.338
- [crickets chirping]
- [baby crying]

00:40:29.595 --> 00:40:30.596
Kitty?

00:40:32.598 --> 00:40:34.433
[baby continues crying]

00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:36.768
Kitty?

00:40:38.312 --> 00:40:40.606
Kitty, the project...

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.651
I'm in. I'm In.

00:40:44.735 --> 00:40:46.028
Let's celebrate.

00:40:52.117 --> 00:40:53.535
Shouldn't you go to him?

00:40:58.373 --> 00:41:01.543
I have been going to him all fucking day.

00:41:07.132 --> 00:41:08.925
[baby continues crying]

00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:14.931
[engine turns off]

00:41:15.015 --> 00:41:16.308
Okay.

00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:19.478
- [baby continues crying]
- [knocks on door]

00:41:23.732 --> 00:41:24.733
Here.

00:41:25.359 --> 00:41:26.443
Come here, darling.

00:41:27.319 --> 00:41:28.862
I don't know how to say this.

00:41:29.655 --> 00:41:31.573
[-I'm ashamed to ask.

00:41:32.157 --> 00:41:33.158
[Chevalier] Anything.

00:41:34.117 --> 00:41:36.036
- Take Peter.
- Sure.

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:37.954
No, for a while, Hoke.

00:41:38.914 --> 00:41:39.915
A while.

00:41:41.875 --> 00:41:44.086
Does Kitty know you're here?

00:41:44.169 --> 00:41:45.379
Yes, of course she knows.

00:41:46.213 --> 00:41:47.673
Of course she knows.

00:41:48.507 --> 00:41:51.093
We're awful people. Selfish, awful people.

00:41:53.387 --> 00:41:54.388
Forget I asked.

00:41:54.471 --> 00:41:56.390
Selfish, awful people,

00:41:56.473 --> 00:41:58.809
they don't know they're selfish and awful.

00:41:59.726 --> 00:42:01.103
Sit, sit, sit.

00:42:02.562 --> 00:42:06.483
Robert, you see beyond the world
we live in.

00:42:08.235 --> 00:42:10.237
There is a price to be paid for that.

00:42:10.946 --> 00:42:12.280
Of course we'll help you.

00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:25.252
[Kitty] Everything's changing, Robert.

00:42:25.836 --> 00:42:27.522
Having a child
was always going to change...

00:42:27.546 --> 00:42:31.091
No, the world, it's pivoting
in some new direction.

00:42:32.092 --> 00:42:33.301
It's reforming.

00:42:35.846 --> 00:42:37.013
This is your moment.

00:42:38.682 --> 00:42:40.326
We're putting together a group
to study feasibili...

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:43.103
"We" shouldn't be doing anything.
You should.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.605
Lawrence won't get this done.

00:42:46.273 --> 00:42:48.483
Or Tolman, or Rabi. You will.

00:42:51.653 --> 00:42:53.655
[chattering]

00:42:57.701 --> 00:42:59.327
[Oppenheimer] Who are the uniforms?

00:43:00.162 --> 00:43:01.580
I thought you might know.

00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:04.791
- [door opens]
- [colonel] Dr. Oppenheimer.

00:43:06.293 --> 00:43:07.502
I'm Colonel Groves.

00:43:07.586 --> 00:43:09.713
This is Lieutenant Colonel Nichols.

00:43:09.796 --> 00:43:11.047
Have that dry cleaned.

00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:19.139
Well, if that's how
you treat Lieutenant Colonel,

00:43:19.222 --> 00:43:22.768
I'd hate to see how you treat
a humble physicist.

00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:24.644
If I ever meet one, I'll let you know.

00:43:24.728 --> 00:43:26.146
[chuckles] Ouch.

00:43:26.229 --> 00:43:29.775
Theaters of combat all over the world
but I have to stay in Washington.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.611
- Why?
- 1 built the Pentagon.

00:43:32.694 --> 00:43:37.115
The brass likes it so much they made me
take over the Manhattan Engineer District.

00:43:37.699 --> 00:43:38.699
Which is?

00:43:39.618 --> 00:43:40.744
Don't be a smart ass.

00:43:40.827 --> 00:43:42.027
You know damn well what it is.

00:43:42.078 --> 00:43:44.539
You and half of every physics department
across the country.

00:43:44.623 --> 00:43:46.500
That's problem number one.

00:43:46.583 --> 00:43:49.628
I thought problem number one
would be securing enough uranium ore.

00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:53.256
- 1,200 tons bought the day I took charge.
- Processing?

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.675
Just broke ground at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

00:43:56.843 --> 00:43:58.470
Now I'm looking for a project director.

00:43:59.471 --> 00:44:00.639
And my name came up?

00:44:00.722 --> 00:44:01.807
Nope.

00:44:02.808 --> 00:44:05.185
Even though you brought quantum physics
to America.

00:44:05.268 --> 00:44:06.478
Which made me curious.

00:44:07.062 --> 00:44:08.271
What've you found out?

00:44:09.481 --> 00:44:13.235
You're a dilettante, a womanizer,
a suspected communist...

00:44:13.318 --> 00:44:14.611
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

00:44:14.694 --> 00:44:16.363
I said "suspected.â

00:44:16.446 --> 00:44:20.492
Unstable, theatrical,
egotistical, neurotic...

00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:23.411
Nothing good, no?
Not even, "He's brilliant, but..."

00:44:23.495 --> 00:44:26.873
Well, brilliance is taken for granted
in your circle, so no.

00:44:26.957 --> 00:44:30.627
No, the only person who had anything good
to say was Richard Tolman.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.629
Tolman thinks you have integrity,

00:44:32.712 --> 00:44:37.133
but he also strikes me as a guy
who knows more about science than people.

00:44:37.717 --> 00:44:38.969
Yet here you are.

00:44:39.594 --> 00:44:41.137
You don't take much on trust.

00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:42.889
I don't take anything on trust.

00:44:46.893 --> 00:44:48.436
Why don't you have a Nobel prize?

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.920
- Why aren't you a general?
- They're making me one for this.

00:44:50.981 --> 00:44:53.942
- Perhaps I'll have the same luck.
- A Nobel prize for making a bomb?

00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:55.902
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

00:44:58.780 --> 00:44:59.990
So how would you proceed?

00:45:01.908 --> 00:45:06.621
You're talking about turning theory
into a practical weapons system

00:45:06.705 --> 00:45:07.998
faster than the Nazis.

00:45:08.081 --> 00:45:09.583
Who have a 12-month head start.

00:45:09.666 --> 00:45:11.751
- Eighteen.
- How could you possibly know that?

00:45:11.835 --> 00:45:14.296
Our fast neutron research took six months.

00:45:14.379 --> 00:45:17.316
The man they've undoubtedly put in charge
will have made that leap instantly.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.718
- Who do you think they put in charge?
- Werner Heisenberg.

00:45:19.801 --> 00:45:24.055
He has the most intuitive understanding
of atomic structure I have ever seen.

00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:25.640
- You know his work?
- L know him.

00:45:25.724 --> 00:45:28.393
Just like I know Walther Bothe,
Von Weizsacker, Diebner.

00:45:28.476 --> 00:45:30.228
In a straight race, the Germans win.

00:45:30.312 --> 00:45:31.396
We've got one hope.

00:45:31.479 --> 00:45:32.689
Which is?

00:45:33.732 --> 00:45:35.066
Anti-Semitism.

00:45:36.526 --> 00:45:37.527
What?

00:45:37.611 --> 00:45:40.363
Hitler called quantum physics
"Jewish science."

00:45:40.447 --> 00:45:41.781
Said it right to Einstein's face.

00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:45.660
Our one hope is that Hitler
is so, so blinded by hate

00:45:45.744 --> 00:45:47.471
that he's denied Heisenberg
proper resources,

00:45:47.495 --> 00:45:49.331
because it'll take vast resources.

00:45:49.414 --> 00:45:51.017
Our nation's best scientists,
working together.

00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:52.208
Right now, they're scattered.

00:45:52.292 --> 00:45:54.085
Which gives us compartmentalization.

00:45:54.169 --> 00:45:57.088
All minds have to see the whole task
to contribute efficiently.

00:45:57.172 --> 00:45:59.341
Poor security may cost us the race.

00:45:59.424 --> 00:46:00.717
Inefficiency will.

00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:03.219
The Germans know more than us anyway.

00:46:03.303 --> 00:46:04.763
The Russians don't.

00:46:06.348 --> 00:46:09.392
Remind me, who are we at war with?

00:46:09.476 --> 00:46:12.729
Somebody with your past
doesn't wanna be seen downplaying

00:46:12.812 --> 00:46:16.191
the importance of security
from our communist allies.

00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:19.027
Point taken. But, no.

00:46:19.611 --> 00:46:21.196
You don't get to say "no" to me.

00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:23.448
It's my job to say
"no" to you when you're wrong.

00:46:24.032 --> 00:46:25.492
So you have the job now?

00:46:25.575 --> 00:46:27.577
Uh, I'm considering it.

00:46:30.372 --> 00:46:32.874
I'm starting to see
where you got your reputation.

00:46:34.084 --> 00:46:35.627
My favorite response?

00:46:36.378 --> 00:46:38.713
"Oppenheimer couldn't run
a hamburger stand.â

00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:41.591
[chuckles] I couldn't.

00:46:43.718 --> 00:46:45.637
But I can run the Manhattan Project.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.015
There's a way to balance these things.

00:46:49.683 --> 00:46:53.103
Keep the Rad Lab here at Berkeley
under Lawrence.

00:46:53.186 --> 00:46:55.271
Met Lab in Chicago under Szilard.

00:46:55.355 --> 00:46:57.732
Large scale refining,
where did you say? Tennessee.

00:46:57.816 --> 00:46:59.401
- And Hanford.
- And Hanford.

00:46:59.484 --> 00:47:02.904
All America's industrial might
and scientific innovation,

00:47:02.988 --> 00:47:05.073
connected by rail.

00:47:05.156 --> 00:47:06.658
Focused on one goal.

00:47:06.741 --> 00:47:08.243
One point in space and time.

00:47:08.326 --> 00:47:09.452
And it comes together here.

00:47:09.536 --> 00:47:10.954
A secret /laboratory.

00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:13.206
In the middle of nowhere,
secure, self-sufficient,

00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:14.874
equipment, housing, the works.

00:47:14.958 --> 00:47:16.543
Keep everyone there until it's done.

00:47:17.293 --> 00:47:19.963
- I'll need the schools, stores, a church.
- Why?

00:47:20.046 --> 00:47:23.174
If we don't let scientists bring
their families, we'll never get the best.

00:47:23.258 --> 00:47:26.011
You want security,
build a town, build it fast.

00:47:26.094 --> 00:47:27.470
Where?

00:47:31.266 --> 00:47:32.767
Welcome to Los Alamos.

00:47:32.851 --> 00:47:35.520
Now, there's a boys' school
we'll have to commandeer

00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:37.373
and the local Indians
come up here for burial rites.

00:47:37.397 --> 00:47:39.190
But, apart from that, nothing.

00:47:39.274 --> 00:47:40.692
Forty miles. Any direction.

00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:42.652
Enough to find the perfect spot.

00:47:42.736 --> 00:47:44.863
- What for?
- Success.

00:47:50.535 --> 00:47:52.287
Build him a town. Fast.

00:47:54.414 --> 00:47:56.207
Let's go recruit some scientists.

00:47:56.791 --> 00:47:59.919
- Why would I leave my family?
- Told you, you can bring your family.

00:48:00.003 --> 00:48:01.379
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

00:48:01.463 --> 00:48:03.590
A soldier? He's a general.

00:48:03.673 --> 00:48:05.341
I've got all the soldier I need.

00:48:05.425 --> 00:48:07.385
What can I tell them?

00:48:07.469 --> 00:48:09.387
Heisenberg, Diebner, Bothe, Bohr.

00:48:09.471 --> 00:48:10.847
What do these men have in common?

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.640
The greatest minds on atomic theory.

00:48:12.724 --> 00:48:14.225
- Yes, and?
- Uh...

00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:16.061
As much as you like...

00:48:17.479 --> 00:48:19.189
until you feel my boot on your balls.

00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.441
You know isotopes

00:48:21.524 --> 00:48:23.860
and you know explosives,
better than anyone in the world.

00:48:23.943 --> 00:48:25.543
But you can't tell us what you're doing.

00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:31.743
- I don't know.
- The Nazis have them.

00:48:31.826 --> 00:48:33.953
- Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
- Under Nazi occupation.

00:48:34.037 --> 00:48:35.877
Did they stop printing newspapers
in Princeton?

00:48:35.955 --> 00:48:39.709
Why would we go to the middle of nowhere
for who knows how long?

00:48:39.793 --> 00:48:41.544
A year or two. Or three.

00:48:42.921 --> 00:48:45.882
General, could you give us a moment?

00:48:47.383 --> 00:48:50.011
It's about unleashing the strong force

00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:53.014
before the Nazis do.

00:48:53.848 --> 00:48:54.974
Oh, my God.

00:48:55.058 --> 00:48:57.352
- Niels won't work for the Nazis.
- No, never.

00:48:57.435 --> 00:48:59.687
But while they have him, we don't.

00:48:59.771 --> 00:49:00.939
That's why I need you.

00:49:01.022 --> 00:49:02.941
Why would you think I'd do that?

00:49:03.024 --> 00:49:04.943
Why? Why?

00:49:05.026 --> 00:49:07.213
How about because this is
the most important fucking thing

00:49:07.237 --> 00:49:09.280
to ever happen in the history
of the world.

00:49:09.364 --> 00:49:11.825
How about that? Fuck.

00:49:17.122 --> 00:49:19.290
They are not gonna let me
onto this project.

00:49:20.041 --> 00:49:23.795
And failing a security check is not gonna
be good for a career, even after the war.

00:49:23.878 --> 00:49:25.505
So you're a fellow traveler.

00:49:25.588 --> 00:49:28.133
So what? This is a national emergency.

00:49:28.216 --> 00:49:31.261
I've got some skeletons,
they put me in charge.

00:49:31.344 --> 00:49:32.345
They need us.

00:49:32.428 --> 00:49:33.888
Until they don't.

00:49:38.017 --> 00:49:40.186
Is there any chance
of getting Bohr out of Denmark?

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:41.396
[Groves] Nah, no dice.

00:49:41.479 --> 00:49:43.648
I checked with the British.

00:49:43.731 --> 00:49:45.733
Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent,

00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:46.817
there's just no way.

00:49:48.653 --> 00:49:49.779
Is he that important?

00:49:49.863 --> 00:49:52.907
How many people do you know
who've proved Einstein wrong?

00:49:54.284 --> 00:49:56.262
You know, it really would be quicker
to take a plane.

00:49:56.286 --> 00:49:57.829
No, plane's too risky.

00:49:57.912 --> 00:49:59.289
Country needs us.

00:50:00.081 --> 00:50:02.000
[construction equipment whirring]

00:50:02.876 --> 00:50:06.129
The Harvard guys, they say the building's
too small for the cyclotron.

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.425
Get them together with the architects.

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:15.722
When's this place supposed to open?

00:50:18.725 --> 00:50:19.893
Two months.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.355
Robert, you're the great improviser,
but this...

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.733
you can't do in your head.

00:50:28.276 --> 00:50:29.569
Four divisions.

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:34.157
Experimental, Theoretical,
Metallurgical, Ordnance.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.325
Who's running Theoretical?

00:50:35.408 --> 00:50:36.618
I am.

00:50:36.701 --> 00:50:39.537
That's what I was afraid of.
You're spread too thin.

00:50:40.914 --> 00:50:42.373
So you take Theoretical.

00:50:45.293 --> 00:50:47.879
I'm not coming here, Robert.

00:50:54.052 --> 00:50:55.053
Why not?

00:51:01.893 --> 00:51:05.563
You drop a bomb
and it falls on the just, and the unjust.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.525
I don't wish the culmination
of three centuries of physics

00:51:09.609 --> 00:51:11.527
to be a weapon of mass destruction.

00:51:21.371 --> 00:51:22.497
Izzy.

00:51:23.414 --> 00:51:27.669
I don't know if we can be trusted
with such a weapon.

00:51:29.254 --> 00:51:32.215
But I know the Nazis can't.

00:51:36.386 --> 00:51:37.553
We have no choice.

00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:41.432
Then...

00:51:43.226 --> 00:51:45.895
the second thing you'll have to do
is appoint Hans Bethe

00:51:45.979 --> 00:51:47.689
to run the theoretical division.

00:51:49.983 --> 00:51:51.901
Wait, what was the first?

00:51:51.985 --> 00:51:55.488
Take off that ridiculous uniform.
You're a scientist.

00:51:55.571 --> 00:51:57.573
Groves is insisting we join.

00:51:57.657 --> 00:51:59.659
Tell Groves to go shit in his hat.

00:51:59.742 --> 00:52:01.786
They need us for who we are.

00:52:01.869 --> 00:52:04.372
So be yourself. Only better.

00:52:44.704 --> 00:52:46.247
- This is the only key.
- [keys jangle]

00:52:46.331 --> 00:52:49.500
And Teller's already here.
Shall I just show him in?

00:52:49.584 --> 00:52:52.628
- No, let's wait for the others.
- [door opens]

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.261
Let's get started.

00:53:01.054 --> 00:53:02.388
Hello, Edward.

00:53:02.472 --> 00:53:03.514
Yes.

00:53:03.598 --> 00:53:05.933
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

00:53:06.017 --> 00:53:08.811
until the T-section at Los Alamos
is finished.

00:53:08.895 --> 00:53:09.896
Edward, can I please...

00:53:09.979 --> 00:53:11.189
It is more important.

00:53:13.316 --> 00:53:17.362
When I calculated the chain reaction,
I found a rather troubling possibility.

00:53:18.488 --> 00:53:21.032
No. This can't be right.

00:53:21.908 --> 00:53:23.427
Show me how you did your calculations.

00:53:23.451 --> 00:53:24.452
[Edward] Yes.

00:53:28.331 --> 00:53:31.542
- It's exponential.
- No. No, no, no. No.

00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:36.506
This is fantasy.

00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:38.633
Teller's calculations can't be right.

00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:41.469
Do them yourself while I go to Princeton.

00:53:41.552 --> 00:53:43.554
- What for?
- To talk to Einstein.

00:53:43.638 --> 00:53:45.932
There's not much common ground
between you two.

00:53:46.015 --> 00:53:47.433
That's why I should get his view.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.440
- Albert.
- Mmm?

00:53:54.524 --> 00:53:57.360
Ah, Dr. Oppenheimer. [chuckles]

00:53:57.443 --> 00:54:00.530
Well, have you met Dr. Godel?
We walk here most days.

00:54:00.613 --> 00:54:04.617
Trees are the most inspiring structures.

00:54:05.284 --> 00:54:06.744
Albert, might I have a word?

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.539
Of course. Excuse me, Kurt.

00:54:11.374 --> 00:54:14.210
You know, some days,
Kurt refuses to eat.

00:54:14.293 --> 00:54:15.420
Even in Princeton.

00:54:15.503 --> 00:54:18.840
He's convinced that the Nazis
can poison his food.

00:54:20.216 --> 00:54:21.384
Hmm?

00:54:24.679 --> 00:54:25.721
Wha...

00:54:30.351 --> 00:54:33.062
Whose... Whose work is this?

00:54:33.146 --> 00:54:34.313
Teller's.

00:54:35.398 --> 00:54:37.108
What do you take it to mean?

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.610
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

00:54:39.694 --> 00:54:43.030
releasing neutrons
to smash into other nuclei.

00:54:43.948 --> 00:54:47.201
Criticality, a point of no return,
massive explosive force.

00:54:47.743 --> 00:54:49.912
But this time,
the chain reaction doesn't stop.

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.207
It would ignite the atmosphere.

00:54:55.168 --> 00:54:56.961
When we detonate an atomic device,

00:54:57.044 --> 00:54:59.130
we might start a chain reaction that...

00:55:00.548 --> 00:55:01.883
destroys the world.

00:55:02.925 --> 00:55:04.594
So here we are, hmm?

00:55:04.677 --> 00:55:09.015
Lost in your quantum world
of probabilities

00:55:09.098 --> 00:55:10.433
and needing certainty.

00:55:11.476 --> 00:55:13.686
Can you run the calculations yourself?

00:55:14.353 --> 00:55:18.649
About the only thing you and I have
in common is a disdain for mathematics.

00:55:18.733 --> 00:55:21.903
- Who's working on this in Berkeley?
- Hans Bethe.

00:55:21.986 --> 00:55:24.238
Well, he'll get to the truth.

00:55:26.073 --> 00:55:28.159
And if the truth is catastrophic?

00:55:28.868 --> 00:55:30.077
Then you stop.

00:55:30.161 --> 00:55:33.122
And you share your findings
with the Nazis.

00:55:33.998 --> 00:55:36.417
So neither side destroys the world.

00:55:40.254 --> 00:55:41.255
Robert.

00:55:42.757 --> 00:55:44.884
This is yours, not mine.

00:55:58.898 --> 00:56:00.274
[Bethe] Teller's wrong.

00:56:00.358 --> 00:56:02.193
- He's wrong.
- Shh, shh, shh...

00:56:02.276 --> 00:56:03.778
[keys jangling]

00:56:04.946 --> 00:56:06.113
[lock clicks]

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:10.535
[lock clicks]

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:13.829
[Bethe] When you know Teller's
critical assumptions,

00:56:13.913 --> 00:56:15.206
the real picture emerges.

00:56:15.289 --> 00:56:16.374
Bottom line?

00:56:17.208 --> 00:56:20.211
The chances of an uncontrolled
nuclear reaction are near zero.

00:56:20.294 --> 00:56:21.587
Near zero.

00:56:23.047 --> 00:56:24.465
Oppie, this is good news.

00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:25.591
Mmm.

00:56:26.759 --> 00:56:29.637
- Can you run them again?
- No, you'll get the same answer.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.365
Till they actually detonate
one of these things,

00:56:31.389 --> 00:56:33.849
the best assurance
you're going to get is this.

00:56:33.933 --> 00:56:34.934
Near zero.

00:56:37.562 --> 00:56:40.314
- [sighs] Theory will take you only so far.
- Mmm.

00:56:41.065 --> 00:56:43.734
- [Chevalier] Hello!
- Hello, you. We missed him.

00:56:44.277 --> 00:56:46.529
- You want to adopt?
- She's kidding.

00:56:46.612 --> 00:56:48.239
We wanted to see you before we left.

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:51.200
For parts unknown.

00:56:52.702 --> 00:56:55.663
You know who I ran into
the other day? Eltenton.

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:57.582
[Oppenheimer] Huh.

00:56:57.665 --> 00:57:00.001
The chemist from Shell? The union guy?

00:57:00.084 --> 00:57:02.628
[Chevalier] Yeah. The FAECT guy.

00:57:04.046 --> 00:57:06.257
He was moaning
about how we're handling the war.

00:57:07.383 --> 00:57:08.801
How so?

00:57:08.884 --> 00:57:11.762
Lack of cooperation with our allies.

00:57:11.846 --> 00:57:15.975
Apparently our government's not sharing
any research with the Russians.

00:57:16.058 --> 00:57:19.854
Well, he said, "Most scientists
think the policy is stupid.â

00:57:23.399 --> 00:57:25.151
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

00:57:25.735 --> 00:57:29.822
He mentioned that if anyone
had anything they wanted to pass on,

00:57:30.698 --> 00:57:34.243
going around official channels,
that he could help.

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.211
That would be treason.

00:57:45.379 --> 00:57:46.797
Yes, of course.

00:57:47.548 --> 00:57:49.175
I just thought you should know.

00:57:51.802 --> 00:57:55.181
The brat is down.
Where are the martinis?

00:58:00.561 --> 00:58:02.063
Coming right up.

00:58:02.146 --> 00:58:03.665
[Oppenheimer]
The conversation ended there.

00:58:03.689 --> 00:58:06.942
Nothing in our long-standing friendship
would have led me to believe

00:58:07.026 --> 00:58:09.987
that Chevalier
was actually seeking information,

00:58:10.071 --> 00:58:14.575
and I am certain that he had no idea
of the work in which I was engaged.

00:58:19.372 --> 00:58:20.998
It has long been clear to me

00:58:21.082 --> 00:58:24.168
that I should have reported
this incident at once.

00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:26.962
[McGee] The Oppenheimer situation
highlights the tension

00:58:27.046 --> 00:58:30.299
between scientists
and the security apparatus.

00:58:30.383 --> 00:58:32.718
In hopes of learning how the nominee
handled such issues

00:58:32.802 --> 00:58:34.845
during his time at the AEC,

00:58:34.929 --> 00:58:37.682
we'll have a scientist
appearing before the committee.

00:58:38.849 --> 00:58:41.352
- Who are they bringing in?
- They haven't said.

00:58:41.435 --> 00:58:42.645
Mr. Chairman, if I may,

00:58:42.728 --> 00:58:45.314
I'm nominated for commerce secretary.

00:58:45.398 --> 00:58:47.608
Why seek the opinion of scientists?

00:58:47.692 --> 00:58:49.902
This is a cabinet post, Admiral.

00:58:49.985 --> 00:58:52.697
We seek a wide range of opinion.

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.092
Well, I'd like to know the name
of the scientist testifying,

00:58:55.116 --> 00:58:56.596
I'd like the chance to cross-examine.

00:58:57.118 --> 00:58:58.786
This is not a court.

00:59:00.162 --> 00:59:01.163
Formality, huh?

00:59:01.247 --> 00:59:04.959
No presidential Cabinet nominee
has failed to be confirmed since 1925.

00:59:05.042 --> 00:59:07.211
This is just how the game is played.

00:59:07.294 --> 00:59:09.672
It's in the bag, Lewis. So play nice.

00:59:10.256 --> 00:59:11.966
They bring in a scientist, so what?

00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:13.926
You don't know scientists
like I do, Counselor.

00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:16.178
They resent anyone
who questions their judgment,

00:59:16.262 --> 00:59:18.222
especially if you're not one of them.

00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:19.765
I was chair of the AEC.

00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:21.934
I'm easy to blame
for what happened to Robert.

00:59:22.017 --> 00:59:24.298
We can't have the Senate
thinking the scientific community

00:59:24.353 --> 00:59:25.813
doesn't support you, sir.

00:59:26.939 --> 00:59:28.899
- Or should we pivot?
- [Senate aide] To what?

00:59:28.983 --> 00:59:30.443
And embrace it.

00:59:30.526 --> 00:59:33.154
"I fought Oppenheimer and the US won."

00:59:33.237 --> 00:59:34.822
I-1 don't think we need to go there.

00:59:34.905 --> 00:59:37.050
Isn't there someone we can call
who knows what really happened?

00:59:37.074 --> 00:59:38.659
- Teller.
- He'll make an impression.

00:59:38.743 --> 00:59:40.637
Can you get the name of the scientist
they've called?

00:59:40.661 --> 00:59:41.537
Probably.

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:44.665
Find out if he was based in Chicago
or Los Alamos during the war.

00:59:44.749 --> 00:59:45.958
Why does that matter?

00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:48.753
If he was based in Chicago,
he worked under Szilard and Fermi,

00:59:48.836 --> 00:59:50.880
not the cult of Oppie at Los Alamos.

00:59:50.963 --> 00:59:52.423
Robert built that damn place.

00:59:52.506 --> 00:59:56.510
He was founder, mayor, sheriff,
all rolled into one.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.936
- [officer chattering on loudspeaker]
- [Peter crying]

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.858
All it needs is a saloon.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.318
[Peter continues crying]

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:37.551
[murmurs]

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:39.678
Let's go and see.

01:00:40.596 --> 01:00:41.806
There's no kitchen.

01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:45.309
Reallyâ? We'll fix that.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:56.237
Barbed wire? Guns? Oppie.

01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:58.322
[Oppenheimer] We're at war, Hans.

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:03.494
Halifax, 1917.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:06.163
A cargo ship carrying munitions
explodes in the harbor.

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:11.627
A vast and sudden chemical reaction.

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:18.133
The biggest man-made explosion in history.

01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:21.554
Now let's calculate how much more
destructive it would have been

01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:25.224
if it were a nuclear,
and not a chemical, reaction.

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:28.269
Expressing power in terms of tons of TNT.

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:29.770
But it will be thousands.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:32.940
Well, then... kilotons.

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:41.323
- Using U-235, the bomb will need...
- Ah...

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:43.450
Right, sorry.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:47.413
Gadget will need a 33-pound sphere
about this size.

01:01:47.496 --> 01:01:51.125
Or using plutonium,
the ten-pound sphere.

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:56.672
Here's the amount of uranium Oak Ridge
refined all of last month.

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:03.387
And the Hanford plant
made this much plutonium.

01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:09.435
Now, if we can enrich these amounts,
we need a way to detonate them.

01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:10.686
[paper rips]

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.146
Are we boring you, Edward?

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.356
A little bit, yes.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.774
May I ask why?

01:02:15.858 --> 01:02:19.153
We all entered this room
knowing a fission bomb was possible.

01:02:19.904 --> 01:02:22.865
- How about we leave it with something new?
- Such as?

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:26.660
Instead of uranium or plutonium,
we use hydrogen.

01:02:26.744 --> 01:02:27.870
[all murmuring]

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.413
Heavy hydrogen.

01:02:29.997 --> 01:02:31.081
Deuterium.

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:32.625
You see?

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:35.377
We compact the atoms together
under great pressure

01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:37.379
to induce a fusion reaction.

01:02:38.464 --> 01:02:41.091
Then we'll get not kilotons,

01:02:41.175 --> 01:02:42.259
but megatons.

01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:45.179
Okay, hang on, hang on.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:49.141
So how do you generate enough force
to fuse hydrogen atoms?

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:51.727
A small fission bomb.

01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:53.604
- Ah...
- There we are!

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.481
[applause, laughter]

01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:57.208
Well, since we're going
to need one anyway,

01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:59.193
can we get back to the business at hand?

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:00.444
[Bartlett] The isotopes issue

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:05.532
wasn't your most important policy
disagreement with Dr. Oppenheimer,

01:03:05.616 --> 01:03:08.160
it was the hydrogen bomb, wasn't it?

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:13.374
As colleagues, we agreed to disagree
on a great many things, uh,

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:17.252
and, well, one of them was the need
for an H-bomb program, yes.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.213
(Siren wailing)

01:03:30.683 --> 01:03:33.268
[Strauss]
Thanks for convening on short notice.

01:03:33.352 --> 01:03:34.770
I can't believe it.

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:37.314
Here we are.

01:03:37.398 --> 01:03:39.358
Catch me up. What do we know?

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:43.529
One of our B-29s over the North Pacific
has detected radiation.

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:45.197
Do we have the filter paper?

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.158
- There's no doubt what this is.
- White House says there's a doubt.

01:03:48.242 --> 01:03:49.660
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:52.538
Are those the long-range detection
filter papers?

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:54.832
It's an atomic test.

01:03:58.502 --> 01:04:00.212
The Russians have a bomb.

01:04:00.295 --> 01:04:03.632
We're supposed to be years ahead of them,
but some...

01:04:03.716 --> 01:04:07.136
What were you guys doing at Los Alamos?
Wasn't security tight?

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:10.059
- Of course it was. You weren't there.
- [Nichols] Forgive me, Doctor...

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:13.183
but I was there.

01:04:14.143 --> 01:04:17.771
We can now consider
the actual mechanics of detonation.

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:19.148
[Oppenheimer] Any ideas?

01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:20.566
[Serber] I call this "shooting."

01:04:20.649 --> 01:04:24.278
We fire a chunk of fissionable material
into a larger sphere

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.905
with enough force to achieve criticality.

01:04:26.989 --> 01:04:28.699
What do we think? Anyone?

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:30.502
[Tolman]
I've been thinking about implosion.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:33.537
Explosives around the sphere
blast inwards, crushing the material.

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.457
I'd like to investigate that idea.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.709
I'll talk to Ordnance,
get you blowing things up.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.920
- [Groves] Progress?
- Nice to see you too.

01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:44.673
Meet the British contingent.

01:04:44.757 --> 01:04:46.425
Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:48.302
How long have you been British?

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:50.554
- Since Hitler told me I wasn't German.
- Aha.

01:04:51.263 --> 01:04:52.931
Come, welcome to Los Alamos.

01:04:53.474 --> 01:04:55.225
School's up and running.

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:57.311
Bar... always running.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:00.522
And I thought of a way
to reduce support staff.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:03.782
- Is that...
- [Oppenheimer] Mrs. Serber, yes.

01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:07.321
I've offered jobs to all the wives.
Admin, librarians, computation.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.531
We cut down on staff,
keep families together.

01:05:09.615 --> 01:05:10.783
Are these women qualified?

01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:13.952
Don't be absurd. These are some
of the brightest minds in our community.

01:05:14.036 --> 01:05:15.746
And they're already security cleared.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:16.890
I've informed General Groves

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:19.434
you've been holding cross-divisional,
open discussions on a nightly basis.

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:20.709
Shut them down.

01:05:20.793 --> 01:05:23.378
Compartmentalization is the key
to maintaining security...

01:05:23.462 --> 01:05:24.379
[Condon] It's only the top men.

01:05:24.463 --> 01:05:26.423
Who presumably communicate
with subordinates.

01:05:26.507 --> 01:05:28.383
These men aren't stupid.
They can be discreet.

01:05:28.467 --> 01:05:29.467
I don't like it.

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:32.179
You don't like anything enough
for that to be a fair test.

01:05:38.102 --> 01:05:40.604
Once a week. Top men only.

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:43.107
- I'd like to bring my brother here.
- No.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:45.776
Nichols...

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.947
I still haven't heard that
my security clearance has been approved.

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.949
- It hasn't.
- We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:53.700
Well, you should wait.

01:05:53.784 --> 01:05:56.328
You are aware that the Nazis
have a two-year head start?

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.306
Dr. Oppenheimer,
the fact that your security clearance

01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:00.374
is proving difficult to obtain
is not my fault.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:01.792
It's yours.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.603
May not be your fault,
but it's your problem.

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:05.087
Because I'm going.

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.297
[Strauss]
And how many people were in these, uh,

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:09.883
open discussions?

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:12.362
Too many. Compartmentalization
was supposed to be the protocol.

01:06:12.386 --> 01:06:14.179
We were in a race against the Nazis.

01:06:14.263 --> 01:06:17.474
- And now the race is against the Soviets.
- Not unless we start it.

01:06:17.558 --> 01:06:21.603
Robert, they just fired a starting gun.

01:06:21.687 --> 01:06:23.897
What's the nature of the device
they detonated?

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:27.484
The data indicates it may have been
a plutonium implosion device.

01:06:27.568 --> 01:06:30.696
Like the one you built at Los Alamos.

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:33.699
The Russians have a bomb,
Truman needs to know what's next.

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:35.659
What's next? Arms talks.

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:37.202
- Arms talks.
- Obviously.

01:06:38.412 --> 01:06:39.663
What about the Super?

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:43.375
Does Truman even know about it?
Did we brief him on that?

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:44.543
Not specifically.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:47.588
We still don't know if a hydrogen bomb's
technically feasible.

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.756
My understanding
is that Teller proposed it?

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.425
- [Oppenheimer] Yes.
- At Los Alamos?

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:53.528
Teller's designs have
always been wildly impractical.

01:06:53.552 --> 01:06:55.554
You'd have to deliver by ox cart.

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:57.556
- Not airplane.
- [Lawrence] Oppie.

01:06:57.639 --> 01:06:59.892
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence.
Do you want to comment?

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:02.769
No.

01:07:04.438 --> 01:07:07.024
Because if it can put us ahead again,

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:12.196
the President of the United States
needs to know about it.

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:13.697
[scoffs]

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:18.660
And if the Russians know about it already
from a spy at Los Alamos,

01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:19.804
then we've gotta get going.

01:07:19.828 --> 01:07:22.748
There's no proof
there was a spy at Los Alamos.

01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:23.832
Robert.

01:07:28.462 --> 01:07:30.547
They put it under the football stadium?

01:07:30.631 --> 01:07:32.507
The field's not in use anymore.

01:07:32.591 --> 01:07:33.842
Just as well.

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:38.513
- Oppie.
- Dr. Fermi.

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:40.682
Come stai? Va bene?

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:44.353
- 1 hear you got a little town.
- Yes. Come and see.

01:07:44.436 --> 01:07:45.437
[Szilard chuckles]

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.774
Who could think straight
in a place like that? Huh?

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.652
Everybody will go crazy.

01:07:52.486 --> 01:07:54.780
Thank you for the vote of confidence,
Szilard.

01:07:56.156 --> 01:07:58.700
Do we really...
Do we really need that in the notes?

01:07:59.451 --> 01:08:01.453
When are you going to try it out?

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:03.205
We did.

01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:06.541
[Fermi] The first self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:08.710
Didn't Groves tell you?

01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:10.462
- [Geiger counter humming]
- No.

01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:17.678
[soldier] One at a time, please.
One at a time.

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.471
Dr. Oppenheimer?

01:08:20.222 --> 01:08:23.225
I tried Personnel.
They asked if I could type.

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:24.476
Can you?

01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:27.187
Harvard forgot to teach that
on the graduate chemistry course.

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.733
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig here
on the plutonium team.

01:08:37.114 --> 01:08:39.408
What the hell were you doing in Chicago?

01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:40.701
Visiting the Met?

01:08:40.784 --> 01:08:41.827
Why?

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:43.954
- Why?
- Because we have every right...

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:47.708
You have just the rights that I give you.
No more, no less.

01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:50.210
We are adults
trying to run a project here.

01:08:50.294 --> 01:08:51.837
This is ridiculous.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.921
Tell him.

01:08:54.506 --> 01:08:57.301
Compartmentalization
is the protocol we agreed to.

01:08:58.552 --> 01:08:59.761
Enough of this madhouse.

01:08:59.845 --> 01:09:01.763
Nobody can work under these conditions.

01:09:01.847 --> 01:09:04.725
You know what, Generalissimo?

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:06.184
I quit.

01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:07.477
Thanks for nothing.

01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:11.273
[Groves] Better off without him.

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:12.399
[door slams]

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:15.527
Aren't you more concerned
about his discretion out there?

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.113
We'll have him killed.

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:21.408
I was just kidding. [chuckles]

01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:23.785
No, he hates me, not America.

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:27.331
You know, General,
not everyone has levers to pull like mine.

01:09:27.414 --> 01:09:28.749
I don't think I understand.

01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:31.418
You didn't hire me
despite my left-wing past,

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:33.086
you hired me because of it.

01:09:34.046 --> 01:09:36.006
So you could control me.

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.675
Well, I'm not that subtle.

01:09:38.759 --> 01:09:40.260
I'm just a humble soldier.

01:09:40.344 --> 01:09:42.346
You're neither humble, nor just a soldier.

01:09:42.429 --> 01:09:45.182
- You studied engineering at MIT.
- Guilty as charged.

01:09:45.265 --> 01:09:46.659
Well, now we understand each other,

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:48.328
perhaps you can get me
my security clearance

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:50.437
so I can perform this miracle for you.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.755
[attorney] General Groves,
were you aware of Dr. Oppenheimer's

01:09:58.779 --> 01:10:01.239
left-wing associations
when you appointed him?

01:10:01.323 --> 01:10:03.468
[Groves] I was aware
that there were suspicions about him.

01:10:03.492 --> 01:10:06.578
I was aware he had
a very extreme, liberal background.

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:09.623
In your opinion, would he ever
consciously commit a disloyal act?

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.625
I would be amazed if he did.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:14.503
[attorney] So you had
complete confidence in his integrity?

01:10:14.586 --> 01:10:17.172
At Los Alamos, yes,
which is where I really knew him.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.925
General, did your security officers
on the project

01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:22.260
advise you against the clearance
of Dr. Oppenheimer?

01:10:22.344 --> 01:10:26.306
They could not and would not clear him
until I insisted.

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:28.117
And it's safe to say that you
had a pretty good knowledge

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:29.851
of Dr. Oppenheimer's security file.

01:10:29.935 --> 01:10:31.019
I did.

01:10:31.603 --> 01:10:34.189
There's only really one question
I need answered here today.

01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:38.860
In light of the current AEC guidelines,
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

01:10:38.944 --> 01:10:40.737
Do you have the guidelines?

01:10:48.203 --> 01:10:53.959
[Robb] Under current AEC guidelines,
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

01:10:54.626 --> 01:10:57.838
- [rooster crows]
- [car approaching]

01:11:03.343 --> 01:11:05.053
[car door opens, closes]

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:07.431
Physics and New Mexico, huh?

01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:08.765
[chuckles]

01:11:08.849 --> 01:11:09.850
My God.

01:11:10.392 --> 01:11:11.893
What a trek.

01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:13.311
That's why you need a liaison.

01:11:13.395 --> 01:11:14.771
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:17.065
You're gonna be okay.

01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:18.400
This way, gentlemen.

01:11:20.652 --> 01:11:22.362
[beakers clinking]

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:24.281
[gas hissing]

01:11:28.452 --> 01:11:30.245
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Leslie.

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.849
I'd like to remind you what
we talked about in Berkeley.

01:11:32.873 --> 01:11:34.749
Compartmentalization.
I understand completely.

01:11:38.253 --> 01:11:39.379
[chattering]

01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:41.673
Thank you.

01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:48.513
[all cheering]

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.534
[Lawrence] Greetings from Berkeley.

01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:54.895
I am here to update you on our progress
and solicit your input.

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:57.189
To do so,
I am going to have to share a few things

01:11:57.272 --> 01:11:59.941
that General Groves told me not to.

01:12:00.025 --> 01:12:02.861
Sorry, General, I said I understood,
not that I agreed.

01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:04.446
- [all chuckling]
- [Lawrence] Okay.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:06.072
Gentlemen, to business.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:09.201
There were rumors of espionage
at Los Alamos.

01:12:09.284 --> 01:12:10.410
Unsubstantiated.

01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:13.580
[Strauss] I'm told that there
were communists on the project.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:15.916
We didn't knowingly employ
any communists.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:18.335
Were any of them involved
in discussions of the Super?

01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:21.004
I seem to remember you demanding
your brother come to Los Alamos.

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:22.756
My brother had left the Party by then.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:23.840
What about Lomanitz?

01:12:23.924 --> 01:12:26.885
Lomanitz was never employed at Los Alamos.
He was a liaison.

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:29.763
Our security was tight,
as former Colonel Nichols well knows.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.617
Our security was as tight as it could be
given the personalities involved,

01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:33.892
but attempts were made.

01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:36.811
- What is that supposed to mean?
- We've all read his file here.

01:12:37.646 --> 01:12:39.814
Do we need to talk about Jean Tatlock?

01:12:40.732 --> 01:12:42.943
Or the Chevalier incident?

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:48.448
Excuse me.

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:53.245
- [phone ringing]
- [secretary] That's Lomanitz, on line one.

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:00.961
Hello, Rossi.

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:04.047
What? Okay, just calm down.

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.383
There's been another screw-up.

01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:08.134
Lomanitz just got drafted.

01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:10.845
- We are at war, Doctor.
- Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

01:13:10.929 --> 01:13:12.931
We need this kid. Fix it, will you?

01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:14.391
It wasn't a mistake.

01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:17.269
Your friend Lomanitz has been trying
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

01:13:17.352 --> 01:13:18.979
He promised to quit all that.

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:20.438
Well, he hasn't.

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:24.234
Security officer at Berkeley's
concerned about communist infiltration

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:26.152
through that union, the FA...

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:28.071
FAECT.

01:13:30.532 --> 01:13:32.784
Well, I'm there next week, I'll...

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.202
drop in to see him.

01:13:36.204 --> 01:13:37.831
Your Q clearance came through.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:45.255
It's important you not maintain or renew
any questionable associations.

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.178
[Robb]
Doctor, did you think social contacts

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:56.349
between a person engaged on secret
war work and communists was dangerous?

01:13:56.433 --> 01:13:59.436
My awareness of the danger
would be greater today.

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:03.023
I mean, it's fair to say
that during the war years,

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:06.318
you felt that such contacts
were potentially dangerous?

01:14:11.406 --> 01:14:12.657
[elevator bell dings]

01:14:12.741 --> 01:14:15.076
[Oppenheimer]
Were conceivably dangerous, yes.

01:14:15.869 --> 01:14:19.289
[Robb] I mean, really? Known communists?

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:23.251
[Oppenheimer] Look...

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:28.590
I've had a lot of secrets in my head
for a long time.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:34.012
Doesn't matter who I associate with.
I don't talk about those secrets.

01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:43.271
[Robb] You said in your statement

01:14:44.356 --> 01:14:45.482
that you had

01:14:46.608 --> 01:14:48.902
to see Jean Tatlock in 1943.

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:52.072
You left.

01:14:53.448 --> 01:14:54.699
Not a word.

01:14:55.367 --> 01:14:57.369
What did you think that would do to me?

01:14:58.662 --> 01:14:59.663
I wrote.

01:14:59.746 --> 01:15:01.748
Pages of nothing.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.002
Where did you go?

01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:09.214
- 1 can't tell you.
- Why not?

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:10.840
Because you're a communist.

01:15:13.468 --> 01:15:15.470
Why did you have to see her?

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:20.308
Because she had indicated a great desire
to see me before we left.

01:15:20.392 --> 01:15:25.021
At that time, I couldn't,
but I felt that she had to see me.

01:15:25.105 --> 01:15:27.774
She was undergoing psychiatric treatment.

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.901
She was extremely unhappy.

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:32.195
Did you find out why she had to see you?

01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:39.244
Because she was still in love with me.

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:48.378
Spent the night together, didn't you?

01:15:56.428 --> 01:15:57.512
[Oppenheimer] Yes.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:06.938
You drop in and out of my life

01:16:07.021 --> 01:16:09.482
and you don't have to tell me why.

01:16:09.566 --> 01:16:10.942
Now, that's power.

01:16:11.025 --> 01:16:13.069
Not that I enjoy.

01:16:13.862 --> 01:16:16.281
I'd rather be here for you as you need.

01:16:16.364 --> 01:16:18.783
But you have other priorities now.

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:21.369
I have a wife and child.

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:25.081
That's not what either of us
is talking about.

01:16:28.835 --> 01:16:29.878
Jean.

01:16:30.754 --> 01:16:32.297
You asked me to come.

01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:35.049
And I'm glad I did.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.594
But I can't see you again.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.599
But what if I need you?

01:16:46.561 --> 01:16:48.563
You said you would always answer.

01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:52.692
Not a word.

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:56.154
[Robb] Did you think that consistent
with good security?

01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:59.115
- [rhythmic thudding]
- As a matter of fact, it was. Not a word.

01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:00.617
[thudding intensifies]

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.410
[Robb] When did you see her after that?

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:10.084
[thudding stops]

01:17:10.752 --> 01:17:12.253
I never saw her again.

01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:21.221
I can make the last train
back to Princeton.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:24.516
Kitty, I didn't say anything
that I hadn't already told you.

01:17:24.599 --> 01:17:27.769
- Today you said it to history, didn't you?
- This is a closed hearing.

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:32.565
If they don't release the transcript,
I'm sure you will.

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:33.650
I was under oath.

01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:36.736
Well, you were under an oath to me
when you went to see Jean.

01:17:37.779 --> 01:17:39.155
You know, you...

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.449
you sit there,

01:17:41.533 --> 01:17:42.534
day after day,

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.995
letting them pick our lives to pieces.

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:49.874
Why won't you fight?

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:56.130
[attorney]
Robert, I'm not putting her up there.

01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:04.597
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an honor.
Please, take a seat.

01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:06.474
No need, I just wanted to check

01:18:06.558 --> 01:18:10.520
whether I should talk to Lomanitz
while I'm here, given your concerns.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:13.481
Well, I'd say that's really up to you,
Professor, but I'd be cautious.

01:18:13.565 --> 01:18:14.899
Uh-huh. Understood.

01:18:14.983 --> 01:18:17.527
Oh, and, um... [clears throat]
as regards to the union,

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:21.155
I wanted to give you a heads-up
on a man named Eltenton.

01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:22.782
- A heads-up?
- Yes.

01:18:22.866 --> 01:18:25.702
Just that he might merit watching, is all.

01:18:27.245 --> 01:18:28.621
I'd love to get more details.

01:18:28.705 --> 01:18:32.041
Well, I have an appointment now,
and I leave early tomorrow.

01:18:32.125 --> 01:18:35.712
Well, come back as early as you like.
Since you haven't time now.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.506
You went back the next morning.

01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:40.550
I did. I had to, really.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:42.760
This time there was another man.

01:18:45.013 --> 01:18:46.347
He said his name was Pash.

01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:49.017
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:54.230
[Robb] Colonel Pash, could you please read
from your memo dated June 29, 19437

01:18:55.982 --> 01:18:58.443
[Pash] "Results of surveillance
conducted on subject

01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:01.404
indicate further possible
Communist Party connections.

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:03.823
Subject met with,
and spent considerable time with,

01:19:03.907 --> 01:19:05.783
one Jean Tatlock, communist,

01:19:05.867 --> 01:19:07.285
the record of whom is attached."â

01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:09.954
- The subject being Dr. Oppenheimer?
- [Pash] Yes.

01:19:10.038 --> 01:19:11.706
[Robb] Whom you had not met?

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:13.124
[Pash] Not then, but soon after.

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:15.752
He's the head of security for the project.
Shouldn't I know him?

01:19:15.835 --> 01:19:19.380
No, he should know you.
I would never put you in a room with Pash.

01:19:19.464 --> 01:19:20.464
Why not?

01:19:21.007 --> 01:19:22.884
When Pash first heard about Lomanitz,

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:25.887
he told the FBI he was gonna kidnap him,

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.722
take him out on a boat,

01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:30.183
and interrogate him in the Russian manner.

01:19:33.227 --> 01:19:35.456
General Groves has placed in me
a certain responsibility,

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.649
and it's like having a child
who I can't see.

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.026
By remote control.

01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:42.737
So to actually meet you is...

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:46.978
- I won't take up too much of your time.
- No, not at all.

01:19:47.033 --> 01:19:48.242
Whatever time you choose.

01:19:49.494 --> 01:19:51.654
Mr. Johnson told me of a conversation
you had yesterday

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:52.997
in which I'm very interested.

01:19:53.081 --> 01:19:55.291
It's had me worried all day.

01:19:55.375 --> 01:19:58.920
Yes, well, I didn't want to talk
to Lomanitz without authorization.

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:00.922
That's not the particular interest
that I have.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:02.465
It's something a little bit more...

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:05.426
in My opinion, more serious.

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:08.304
Now, when the FBI pointed out
that such information

01:20:08.388 --> 01:20:09.722
wouldn't be admissible in court,

01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:13.935
Pash made it clear he had no intention
of leaving any witness left to prosecute.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:17.105
Now, the FBI talked him down,
but that's the man you're dancing with.

01:20:17.188 --> 01:20:19.899
I gather you've heard
there are other parties

01:20:19.983 --> 01:20:21.985
interested in the work
of the Radiation Lab?

01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:29.450
A man attached to the Soviet Consul
indicated through intermediate people

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:34.580
to people on this project that he was
in a position to transmit information.

01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:37.041
Why would anyone on the project
wanna do that?

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.295
Frankly, I can see
that there might be an argument

01:20:41.379 --> 01:20:43.756
for the commander-in-chief
informing the Russians.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.842
They're our allies after all.

01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:48.720
But I don't like the idea
of it going out the back door.

01:20:48.803 --> 01:20:51.014
It might not hurt
to be on the lookout for it.

01:20:52.223 --> 01:20:54.017
And you said that to Pash?

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:58.312
I was trying to put it in the context
of "Russia's not Germany."

01:20:58.396 --> 01:21:02.900
Boris Pash is the son
of a Russian Orthodox bishop.

01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:04.902
Born here, but in 1918,

01:21:04.986 --> 01:21:07.405
he went back to Russia
to fight the Bolsheviks.

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:10.324
This is a man who has killed communists
with his own hands.

01:21:10.408 --> 01:21:13.536
I'm not the judge of who should
or should not have information.

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:16.205
It's my business to stop it
from going through illegally.

01:21:16.289 --> 01:21:18.166
Would you be a little more specific?

01:21:20.752 --> 01:21:24.464
There's a man whose name
was mentioned to me a couple of times.

01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:25.548
Eltenton.

01:21:26.674 --> 01:21:29.802
Uh, I believe he's a chemist
who works at Shell.

01:21:29.886 --> 01:21:33.014
He talked to a friend of his

01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:35.933
who's an acquaintance
of someone on the project.

01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:40.063
And you thought Pash
would be satisfied with that?

01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:43.983
I was attempting to give them Eltenton
without opening a can of worms.

01:21:44.067 --> 01:21:45.943
I told them a cock-and-bull story.

01:21:46.027 --> 01:21:47.528
Did you lie to General Groves too?

01:21:47.612 --> 01:21:51.115
No. I admitted to him
that I'd lied to Pash.

01:21:51.199 --> 01:21:52.909
[attorney]
Do you recall this conversation

01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:54.452
about the Chevalier incident?

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:57.497
[scoffs] I've seen so many versions of it,

01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.083
I wasn't confused before
but I'm certainly getting there now.

01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:01.435
[attorney]
What was your conclusion?

01:22:01.459 --> 01:22:06.756
That he was under the influence of
the typical American schoolboy attitude

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:10.301
that there's something wicked
about telling on a friend.

01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:11.552
Well, now...

01:22:12.303 --> 01:22:14.889
Might we know through whom
the contact was made?

01:22:15.473 --> 01:22:19.268
That would involve people
who are not to be involved in this.

01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:22.188
Is that someone
a member of the project?

01:22:22.772 --> 01:22:26.234
A member of the faculty, yes,
but not in the project, no.

01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:27.318
Ah.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:32.490
So Eltenton made his approach through
a member of the faculty here at Berkeley?

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:36.869
As far as I know... As far as I know, yes.

01:22:36.953 --> 01:22:38.871
But... [stammers] ...there may have been...

01:22:39.747 --> 01:22:41.457
more than one person involved.

01:22:46.504 --> 01:22:50.424
Gentlemen, if I... If I seem uncooperative,
I think you can understand

01:22:50.508 --> 01:22:51.668
it's because of my insistence

01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:54.595
in not getting innocent people
into trouble.

01:22:54.679 --> 01:22:57.515
You're trying to protect your friend.
Who's protecting you?

01:22:57.598 --> 01:23:00.184
- Well, you could.
- If you gave me the name.

01:23:00.268 --> 01:23:01.853
If you order me to, I'll do it.

01:23:01.936 --> 01:23:05.022
That is a mistake, Robert.
You need to volunteer this name.

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.901
- [Robb] And did he give you the name?
- [Groves] He did.

01:23:08.985 --> 01:23:10.337
- [Robb] But not then, did he?
- No.

01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:12.864
No. In fact,
it was some months later, wasn't it?

01:23:12.947 --> 01:23:13.948
It was.

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:16.826
- You see me as persistent.
- Well, you are...

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:18.870
You are persistent, but that is your job.

01:23:18.953 --> 01:23:22.498
And-And my job is to protect the people
that work for me.

01:23:22.582 --> 01:23:26.335
Instead of us going on certain steps,
which may come to your attention...

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:29.922
and be disturbing to you,

01:23:30.006 --> 01:23:32.258
I would like to discuss those
with you first.

01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:36.679
I'm not formulating a plan.
I'll just have to digest the whole thing.

01:23:41.017 --> 01:23:44.103
In the months in between your interview
with Dr. Oppenheimer

01:23:44.187 --> 01:23:46.772
and his eventual naming of Chevalier,

01:23:46.856 --> 01:23:49.775
did you expend resources trying to find
the name of the intermediary?

01:23:49.859 --> 01:23:52.236
Considerable resources, yes.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.363
Without the name,
our job was extremely difficult.

01:23:54.447 --> 01:23:55.823
And when did you receive the name?

01:23:55.907 --> 01:23:58.784
I was gone by the time Oppenheimer
finally offered it up.

01:23:58.868 --> 01:23:59.744
Gone?

01:23:59.827 --> 01:24:01.954
They felt my time
would be better spent in Europe

01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:04.373
determining the status
of the Nazi bomb project.

01:24:04.457 --> 01:24:05.625
Who did?

01:24:06.876 --> 01:24:07.919
General Groves.

01:24:08.878 --> 01:24:10.338
He transferred me to London.

01:24:13.257 --> 01:24:14.258
[marbles clattering]

01:24:17.178 --> 01:24:19.072
[Serber]
Its a little early for a Christmas party.

01:24:19.096 --> 01:24:22.266
Something's up.
Tolman's been away.

01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:24.352
Where?

01:24:24.852 --> 01:24:26.020
Ruth won't tell.

01:24:29.023 --> 01:24:30.900
[chattering]

01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:31.984
Hey!

01:24:36.239 --> 01:24:39.367
Come on, Ruthie.
Can't tell me, who can you tell?

01:24:39.951 --> 01:24:41.410
Compartmentalization, Oppie.

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:44.664
What makes you think
I know where he is anyway?

01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:46.499
"Cause you do a pretty good job of knowing

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:48.417
where Mr. Tolman is when it counts.

01:24:49.085 --> 01:24:50.086
Like now?

01:24:50.169 --> 01:24:53.506
[Groves] Attention!

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:55.049
[chattering stops]

01:24:56.342 --> 01:24:58.386
[Groves]
Early Christmas present for you all.

01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:01.097
[scattered laughter]

01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:05.101
[cheering]

01:25:06.811 --> 01:25:09.146
[Bohr] The British pilots
put me in the bomb bay.

01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:12.233
Showed me the-the oxygen,
you know, but I messed it up.

01:25:12.316 --> 01:25:13.317
[scattered laughter]

01:25:13.401 --> 01:25:15.695
When they opened me up in Scotland,
I was unconscious.

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:18.739
- But I pretended I'd been napping.
- [laughing]

01:25:18.823 --> 01:25:20.241
[Bohr] Please enjoy your party.

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:22.785
Is it big enough?

01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:24.245
To end the war?

01:25:24.912 --> 01:25:27.039
To end all war.

01:25:29.959 --> 01:25:33.963
- Heisenberg sought me out in Copenhagen.
- [marbles clattering]

01:25:34.714 --> 01:25:37.967
It was chilling,
my old student working for the Nazis.

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:41.762
He told me some things to draw me out.

01:25:42.722 --> 01:25:45.683
Sustained fission reactions in uranium.

01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:47.852
That sounds more like a reactor
than a bomb.

01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:49.687
Did he mention gaseous diffusion?

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.981
He seemed more focused on heavy water.

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:53.816
As a moderator?

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:55.151
Yes, instead of graphite.

01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:57.111
[Bethe laughs]

01:25:58.237 --> 01:25:59.530
What?

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:03.367
He took a wrong turn. We're ahead.

01:26:03.451 --> 01:26:05.369
And with you here to help us, Niels...

01:26:05.453 --> 01:26:09.123
Sorry, could you... could you
give us a moment, gentlemen?

01:26:09.206 --> 01:26:10.291
[glasses clinking]

01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:17.923
I am not here to help, Robert.

01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:20.634
I knew you could do this without me.

01:26:20.718 --> 01:26:22.845
- Then why did you come?
- To talk about after.

01:26:22.928 --> 01:26:27.350
The power you're about to reveal
will forever outlive the Nazis.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.685
And the world is not prepared.

01:26:29.769 --> 01:26:33.314
"You could lift the stone without being
ready for the snake that's revealed."

01:26:33.397 --> 01:26:35.232
We have to make
the politicians understand,

01:26:35.316 --> 01:26:36.859
this isn't a new weapon.

01:26:37.485 --> 01:26:38.611
It's a new world.

01:26:39.362 --> 01:26:41.781
I'll be out there doing what I can,
but you...

01:26:42.365 --> 01:26:45.159
You are an American Prometheus.

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:49.121
The man who gave them the power
to destroy themselves,

01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:50.956
and they'll respect that.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.042
Then your work really begins.

01:26:57.671 --> 01:27:00.049
I'm sorry, Oppie,
but there's a call.

01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:03.177
From San Francisco.

01:27:10.267 --> 01:27:11.352
Robert?

01:27:15.856 --> 01:27:16.982
Robert?

01:27:17.483 --> 01:27:20.111
Robert. Robert.

01:27:20.194 --> 01:27:21.695
Oh, my God. What's the matter?

01:27:21.779 --> 01:27:22.947
What happened?

01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:24.407
[both breathing heavily]

01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:26.367
Her father called.

01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:28.077
They found her yesterday in the bath.

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:30.996
Who?

01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:34.041
She'd taken pills.

01:27:34.125 --> 01:27:35.459
Left a note, not signed.

01:27:37.002 --> 01:27:39.880
She took barbiturates, but there
was chloral hydrate in her blood.

01:27:39.964 --> 01:27:41.465
[gasping]

01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:44.677
There was a note.

01:27:45.469 --> 01:27:46.887
Jean Tatlock?

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:54.854
We were together.

01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:57.314
She said she needed me. I...

01:27:59.692 --> 01:28:01.819
I told her I... [breathing shakily]
I wouldn't...

01:28:02.695 --> 01:28:04.405
I told her I couldn't...

01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:06.490
No, it was... it was me...

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:11.328
[breathing heavily]
You don't get to commit the sin

01:28:11.412 --> 01:28:14.790
and then have us all feel sorry for you
that it had consequences.

01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:20.004
You pull yourself together.

01:28:24.008 --> 01:28:25.926
You know, people here depend on you.

01:28:28.137 --> 01:28:30.323
[Serber] Donald, would you like
to contribute here, please?

01:28:30.347 --> 01:28:31.575
[Donald] You're on your own, pal.

01:28:31.599 --> 01:28:34.518
Bob, I'm not quitting my job
because plutonium is radioactive.

01:28:34.602 --> 01:28:37.521
We just don't know what it might do
to the female reproductive system...

01:28:37.605 --> 01:28:40.691
Your reproductive system is
more exposed than mine, presumably.

01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:43.444
Can we please?
The implosion device is nowhere.

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:45.127
You can't rush everything.
Oppie, please.

01:28:45.154 --> 01:28:47.794
Well, there's rushing and there's
getting on with it, so, pick one.

01:28:47.865 --> 01:28:49.742
Wait. Neddermeyer's doing his job.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:52.453
Teller's not helping. You're not helping.

01:28:52.536 --> 01:28:55.140
I've been asking for calculations
on the implosion lenses for weeks.

01:28:55.164 --> 01:28:57.791
- The British can do it. Fuchs.
- Absolutely.

01:28:57.875 --> 01:29:01.170
- It's your job, Teller.
- I'm engaged in research.

01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:03.672
On a hydrogen bomb
we're not even building.

01:29:03.756 --> 01:29:05.382
[scattered laughter]

01:29:11.931 --> 01:29:13.140
I won't work for that man.

01:29:13.224 --> 01:29:15.017
[jeering]

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.269
Let him go. He's a prima Donna.

01:29:17.353 --> 01:29:19.313
[Serber] I agree.
He should leave Los Alamos.

01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:20.898
Okay.

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:24.193
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.
Seth, I'm putting you on plutonium.

01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:27.780
Lilli, you go work for Kisty,
because he needs you.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:29.532
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

01:29:29.615 --> 01:29:32.409
I'm putting you exclusively
on the implosion device.

01:29:32.493 --> 01:29:36.121
And no one is leaving Los Alamos.

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:39.708
[vehicle engine starting]

01:29:39.792 --> 01:29:41.794
[chattering on loudspeaker]

01:29:50.511 --> 01:29:51.762
They won't let me leave.

01:29:51.845 --> 01:29:53.806
No. I won't let you leave.

01:29:55.516 --> 01:29:58.102
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

01:29:58.185 --> 01:30:01.313
Stay here, research what you want.

01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:03.732
Fusion, the hydrogen bomb, whatever.

01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:05.109
We'll meet to discuss.

01:30:05.192 --> 01:30:08.028
You don't have time to meet.
You're a politician now, Robert.

01:30:08.112 --> 01:30:10.656
You've left physics behind
many, many years ago.

01:30:11.824 --> 01:30:12.825
Once a week.

01:30:13.492 --> 01:30:15.244
One hour, you and me.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:22.835
Now raise this fucking barrier.

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:31.510
[Robb] So the Super was under development
on your watch at Los Alamos?

01:30:31.594 --> 01:30:33.012
Yes.

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:36.557
And yet, after the war,
you tried to deny it was viable.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:39.727
No, no, no. I-l pointed out
technical difficulties with it.

01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:41.770
Didn't you try to kill it
at the AEC meeting

01:30:41.854 --> 01:30:43.272
- after the Russian bomb test?
- No.

01:30:43.355 --> 01:30:46.609
[Robb] But that was the recommendation
of the AEC, was it not?

01:30:46.692 --> 01:30:49.820
After hours of discussion
about the best response.

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:55.117
An H-bomb is 1,000 times the power
of an A-bomb.

01:30:55.868 --> 01:30:59.997
Its only intended target
would be the largest cities.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.624
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

01:31:01.707 --> 01:31:05.919
Izzy, draw some circles on this side
of the map where they would target us.

01:31:06.003 --> 01:31:07.129
Starting with New York.

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:08.398
- [Rabi] That's fair.
- [Strauss] DC.

01:31:08.422 --> 01:31:11.050
It's a weapon of attack
with no defensive value.

01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:12.635
- Deterrence.
- [Bush] "Deterrence"?

01:31:12.718 --> 01:31:16.805
Do we really need more deterrence
than our current arsenal of atomic bombs?

01:31:16.889 --> 01:31:20.934
Y-You drown in ten feet of water
or 10,000, what's the difference?

01:31:21.018 --> 01:31:23.145
We can already drown Russia. They know it.

01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:25.522
- Now they can drown us.
- [Rabi] We're just escalating.

01:31:29.485 --> 01:31:32.363
- [feet stamping]
- [Strauss, distant] Robert? Robert.

01:31:32.446 --> 01:31:34.531
- [stamping stops]
- [teaspoon clinks]

01:31:36.367 --> 01:31:37.368
As I said,

01:31:37.451 --> 01:31:41.288
Teller's designs are still as impractical
as they were during the war.

01:31:41.372 --> 01:31:44.208
A hydrogen bomb can be made to work,
Oppie, you know that.

01:31:44.291 --> 01:31:47.086
I don't believe we should commit
all our resources to that chance.

01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:50.172
Then how would you have Truman
reassure the American people?

01:31:50.255 --> 01:31:52.591
Simply by limiting the spread
of atomic weapons

01:31:52.675 --> 01:31:55.135
through international control
on nuclear energy.

01:31:55.761 --> 01:31:57.471
By which you mean world government.

01:31:57.554 --> 01:32:00.391
The United Nations, as Roosevelt intended.

01:32:00.474 --> 01:32:03.352
Well, I asked
what Truman should do, right?

01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:04.436
The world's changed.

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.898
It's not fascism but communism
that now threatens our survival.

01:32:07.981 --> 01:32:09.858
Lewis, do you understand,

01:32:09.942 --> 01:32:11.527
if we build a hydrogen bomb,

01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:13.821
the Russians will have no choice
but to build their own?

01:32:13.904 --> 01:32:15.447
Could they be working on one already,

01:32:15.531 --> 01:32:18.534
based on information gathered
from a spy at Los Alamos?

01:32:18.617 --> 01:32:20.077
No spy at Los Alamos.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:22.996
- Gentlemen. Let's not get sidetracked.
- There wasn't?

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.749
I say we use this moment
to gain concessions from the Russians

01:32:25.833 --> 01:32:28.794
by committing that we will not build
a hydrogen bomb.

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:30.546
Thereby revealing its existence.

01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:32.631
Which you seem convinced
they already know.

01:32:32.715 --> 01:32:36.135
[clears throat] All right. At this point,
I'd like the committee members

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:39.888
to meet in privacy
to finalize our recommendations.

01:32:41.432 --> 01:32:43.392
I'm just not sure
you wanna go down this road.

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:44.476
Lewis, with respect,

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.354
we are the advisory committee,
we will give them our advice.

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:54.111
Dr. Oppenheimer?

01:32:54.194 --> 01:32:55.320
Hi.

01:32:55.404 --> 01:32:58.240
William Borden.
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy?

01:32:58.323 --> 01:32:59.575
Oh, yes, yes.

01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:01.034
During the war, I was a pilot.

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:05.122
One night, flying back from a raid,

01:33:05.205 --> 01:33:06.999
I saw an amazing sight,

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:08.751
like a meteor.

01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:11.962
A V-2 rocket headed to England.

01:33:12.045 --> 01:33:15.048
I can't help but imagine what it will be
for such an enemy rocket

01:33:15.132 --> 01:33:17.968
to carry an atomic warhead.

01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:19.762
[feet stamping]

01:33:20.846 --> 01:33:21.846
[rocket rumbling]

01:33:23.432 --> 01:33:25.142
[stamping intensifies, stops]

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:29.563
Well, let's make sure we're not the ones
to make that possible.

01:33:35.694 --> 01:33:38.030
Oppie, I don't think
you wanna go up against Strauss.

01:33:38.864 --> 01:33:41.033
If we both speak, they listen to me.

01:33:41.575 --> 01:33:43.452
When you speak, they hear a prophet.

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:45.370
When Strauss speaks, they hear themselves.

01:33:45.454 --> 01:33:47.539
They'll listen to a prophet.

01:33:47.623 --> 01:33:49.541
A prophet can't be wrong.

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:50.542
Not once.

01:33:50.626 --> 01:33:54.129
[McGee] Didn't you accuse Oppenheimer of
sabotaging the development of the Super?

01:33:54.213 --> 01:33:58.509
I was never one of those to bandy around
terms like "sabotage."

01:33:58.592 --> 01:34:00.010
[McGee] But Mr. Borden was?

01:34:00.636 --> 01:34:02.346
As I understand it, possibly.

01:34:02.429 --> 01:34:06.099
How was Mr. Borden able to put together
such a detailed indictment?

01:34:06.183 --> 01:34:07.768
He was no longer a government employee,

01:34:07.851 --> 01:34:10.020
yet he appears to have had
unlimited access

01:34:10.103 --> 01:34:11.605
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:14.441
Might Mr. Nichols
have given him access to the file?

01:34:14.525 --> 01:34:16.652
Or someone else at the AEC?

01:34:16.735 --> 01:34:19.446
That's a very serious accusation, Senator.

01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:21.114
Is it your intention to suggest

01:34:21.198 --> 01:34:23.867
that Dr. Oppenheimer
is disloyal to the United States?

01:34:24.451 --> 01:34:26.537
I've always assumed, and still assume,

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.039
that he's loyal to the United States.

01:34:29.122 --> 01:34:30.165
I believe this.

01:34:30.249 --> 01:34:33.627
And I shall believe it until I see
very conclusive proof to the opposite.

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:37.714
[Robb] Do you, or do you not, believe
that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

01:34:46.598 --> 01:34:49.685
[Hornig] And if I may, when Hitler
blew his brains out in that bunker,

01:34:49.768 --> 01:34:53.021
it is my humble opinion that
there is no need for that bomb to be seen

01:34:53.105 --> 01:34:54.606
anywhere except for that test site.

01:34:54.690 --> 01:34:55.566
[scattered applause]

01:34:55.649 --> 01:34:58.235
[Lilli] We at least
have to take a moment to think about

01:34:58.318 --> 01:35:01.405
whether the means
justify the ends any longer, because...

01:35:04.116 --> 01:35:06.285
Germany is about to surrender.

01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:08.328
[members cheering, applauding]

01:35:08.412 --> 01:35:12.416
It's no longer the enemy
who are the greatest threat to mankind.

01:35:12.499 --> 01:35:13.499
It's our work.

01:35:16.086 --> 01:35:18.505
Hitler is dead, it's true.

01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:22.009
But the Japanese fight on.

01:35:22.092 --> 01:35:23.844
Their defeat seems assured.

01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:26.555
Not if you're a GI preparing to invade.

01:35:28.098 --> 01:35:29.182
We can end this war.

01:35:29.266 --> 01:35:32.603
But how do we justify using this weapon
on human beings?

01:35:32.686 --> 01:35:33.896
[scattered applause]

01:35:35.898 --> 01:35:38.734
We're theorists, yes?

01:35:40.068 --> 01:35:44.197
We imagine a future,
and our imaginings horrify us.

01:35:45.574 --> 01:35:47.910
But they won't fear it
until they understand it,

01:35:47.993 --> 01:35:50.662
and they won't understand it
until they've used it.

01:35:50.746 --> 01:35:54.583
When the world learns the terrible secret
of Los Alamos,

01:35:54.666 --> 01:35:58.086
our work here will ensure a peace
mankind has never seen.

01:35:58.170 --> 01:36:01.298
A peace based
on the kind of international cooperation

01:36:01.381 --> 01:36:03.508
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

01:36:08.722 --> 01:36:11.558
- [Oppenheimer] Progress?
- Two years and a billion dollars' worth?

01:36:12.476 --> 01:36:14.144
Well, hard to put a price on it.

01:36:14.227 --> 01:36:15.896
Not really. Just add up the bills.

01:36:15.979 --> 01:36:20.233
"Rural free deliveries."
Eighty babies delivered the first year.

01:36:20.317 --> 01:36:22.903
This year we've had ten a month.

01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:25.864
Birth control is a little out
of my jurisdiction, General.

01:36:26.365 --> 01:36:27.485
- Clearly.
- [Kitty] General.

01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:28.617
Kiddo.

01:36:33.622 --> 01:36:36.667
Head down, every... Fuchs. Head down.

01:36:43.674 --> 01:36:45.550
That's the one. [grunts]

01:36:45.634 --> 01:36:48.136
Two viable bombs. I need a date.

01:36:51.181 --> 01:36:52.391
September.

01:36:52.474 --> 01:36:53.517
July.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.394
That's the sweet spot, gentlemen.

01:36:56.186 --> 01:36:57.729
August.

01:36:57.813 --> 01:36:59.356
July.

01:36:59.439 --> 01:37:02.484
Test in July. But I need my brother.

01:37:06.822 --> 01:37:09.408
Frank knows the desert,
he's left politics behind,

01:37:09.491 --> 01:37:11.702
he's been working with Lawrence
for two years now.

01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:20.377
What do we call the test?

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.340
"Batter my heart,
three person'd God."

01:37:25.424 --> 01:37:26.425
What?

01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:29.011
Trinity.

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:39.247
[Robb] You insisted on bringing
on your brother Frank,

01:37:39.271 --> 01:37:40.397
a known communist.

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:42.107
Former communist.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.109
You brought a known former communist

01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:47.946
onto America's most secret
and important defense project.

01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:51.283
I knew my brother could be trusted.
Absolutely.

01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:54.619
And you felt your judgment was sound
on who on the team could be trusted.

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:58.415
Fuchs, head down.
Okay, everybody ready.

01:38:08.133 --> 01:38:09.384
I hope you learned something.

01:38:09.468 --> 01:38:11.845
Yeah, we learned
we're gonna need to be a lot further away.

01:38:11.928 --> 01:38:13.305
Well, figure it out. Fast.

01:38:13.388 --> 01:38:16.391
We leave for Washington in the morning.
We're gonna give them a date.

01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:21.229
[elevator bell dings]

01:38:21.313 --> 01:38:22.522
[chattering]

01:38:22.606 --> 01:38:24.566
[phone ringing]

01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:25.650
[service bell dinging]

01:38:31.615 --> 01:38:33.325
You're a long way from Chicago, Leo.

01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:36.328
If we don't act now, they're going
to use this thing against Japan.

01:38:36.912 --> 01:38:39.831
We booked a meeting with Truman,
but somebody killed it.

01:38:39.915 --> 01:38:42.250
You're meeting the secretary of war.

01:38:42.334 --> 01:38:43.877
Just because we're building it

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.754
doesn't mean
we get to decide how it's used.

01:38:46.630 --> 01:38:48.715
History will judge us, Robert.

01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:51.551
In Chicago,
we put together a petition.

01:38:52.344 --> 01:38:53.887
I'm not getting into that.

01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:55.555
[clipboard clatters]

01:38:59.309 --> 01:39:01.079
Just tell me your concerns
and I'll relay them.

01:39:01.103 --> 01:39:02.145
My concerns?

01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:05.607
Germany's defeated.
Japan's not going to hold out alone.

01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:07.901
How could you know that?
You got us into this.

01:39:07.984 --> 01:39:11.404
You and Einstein with your letter
to Roosevelt saying we could build a bomb.

01:39:11.488 --> 01:39:12.405
Against Germany.

01:39:12.489 --> 01:39:15.367
That's not how weapons manufacture
works, Szilard.

01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:16.761
[Szilard] Oppie, you have to help.

01:39:16.785 --> 01:39:18.596
Fermi's in the meeting.
Lawrence is in the meeting.

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:21.832
They're not you.
You're the great salesman of science.

01:39:21.915 --> 01:39:24.126
You can convince anyone of anything.

01:39:25.085 --> 01:39:26.086
Even yourself.

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:27.921
Excuse me.

01:39:29.422 --> 01:39:32.634
The firestorm in Tokyo
killed 100,000 people.

01:39:32.717 --> 01:39:34.177
Mostly civilians.

01:39:35.428 --> 01:39:38.849
I worry about an America where we
do these things and no one protests.

01:39:38.932 --> 01:39:42.269
Pearl Harbor and three years
of brutal conflict in the Pacific

01:39:42.352 --> 01:39:44.604
bought us a lot of latitude
with the American public.

01:39:45.188 --> 01:39:47.149
[Stimson]
Enough to unleash the atomic bomb?

01:39:47.232 --> 01:39:50.485
[Fermi] The A-bomb might not cause
as much damage as the Tokyo bombings.

01:39:50.569 --> 01:39:52.028
What are we estimating?

01:39:52.112 --> 01:39:56.908
In a medium-sized city,
20,000 or 30,000 dead.

01:39:56.992 --> 01:39:59.035
Yes, but don't underestimate

01:39:59.119 --> 01:40:02.539
the psychological impact
of an atomic explosion.

01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:06.418
A pillar of fire 10,000 feet tall.

01:40:07.127 --> 01:40:10.213
Deadly neutron effects for a mile.
In all directions.

01:40:10.297 --> 01:40:13.175
From one single device.

01:40:13.258 --> 01:40:15.427
Dropped from a barely noticed B-29,

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:20.682
the atomic bomb will be
a terrible revelation of divine power.

01:40:21.308 --> 01:40:23.935
If that's true, it would be definitive.

01:40:24.019 --> 01:40:26.021
World War II would be over.

01:40:26.104 --> 01:40:27.647
Our boys would come home.

01:40:27.731 --> 01:40:28.857
Military targets?

01:40:30.192 --> 01:40:32.194
Uh... There aren't any big enough.

01:40:32.277 --> 01:40:35.197
Perhaps a vital war plant

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.866
with workers housed nearby?

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:41.119
And we could issue a warning
to reduce civilian casualties.

01:40:41.203 --> 01:40:43.121
They'd send everything they have
up against us,

01:40:43.205 --> 01:40:44.873
and I'd be up in that plane.

01:40:44.956 --> 01:40:48.168
But if we announce it
and it fails to go off,

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:50.837
we'd scupper any chance
of a Japanese surrender.

01:40:50.921 --> 01:40:55.342
Is there no way to demonstrate
a bomb to Japan to provoke surrender?

01:40:55.425 --> 01:40:59.554
We intend to demonstrate it
in the most unambiguous terms. Twice.

01:40:59.638 --> 01:41:01.848
Once, to show the weapon's power,

01:41:01.932 --> 01:41:05.352
and a second to show that we can
keep doing this until they surrender.

01:41:05.435 --> 01:41:08.813
We have a list of 12 cities
to choose from...

01:41:08.897 --> 01:41:10.815
Sorry, 11.

01:41:10.899 --> 01:41:12.776
I've taken Kyoto off the list

01:41:12.859 --> 01:41:16.404
due to its cultural significance
to the Japanese people.

01:41:16.488 --> 01:41:18.698
Also, my wife and I honeymooned there.

01:41:19.199 --> 01:41:20.492
It's a magnificent city.

01:41:24.162 --> 01:41:25.956
Let me make this simple for you,
gentlemen.

01:41:26.039 --> 01:41:28.500
According to my intelligence,
which I cannot share with you,

01:41:28.583 --> 01:41:32.671
the Japanese people will not surrender,
under any circumstances,

01:41:32.754 --> 01:41:36.049
short of a successful
and total invasion of the home islands.

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:39.386
Many lives will be lost,
American and Japanese.

01:41:39.469 --> 01:41:43.390
The use of the atomic bomb
on Japanese cities will save lives.

01:41:43.473 --> 01:41:45.392
If we retain moral advantage.

01:41:46.059 --> 01:41:47.227
How so?

01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:49.538
Well, if we use this weapon
without informing our allies,

01:41:49.562 --> 01:41:52.440
they'll see it as a threat,
and we'll be in an arms race.

01:41:52.524 --> 01:41:54.442
How open can we be
with the Soviets?

01:41:54.526 --> 01:41:58.571
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets
from becoming part of the atomic world.

01:41:58.655 --> 01:42:00.657
We've been told
they have no uranium.

01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:03.702
You've been misinformed.
A Russian bomb is a matter of time.

01:42:03.785 --> 01:42:07.247
The program needs to continue
at full pace after the war.

01:42:08.039 --> 01:42:09.874
Secretary Stimson, if I may,

01:42:09.958 --> 01:42:13.920
not all scientists
on the project are in agreement.

01:42:14.004 --> 01:42:17.590
In fact, this might be a moment
to consider other opinions. If you talk...

01:42:17.674 --> 01:42:20.343
The Manhattan Project
has been plagued from the start

01:42:20.427 --> 01:42:23.805
by certain scientists
of doubtful discretion

01:42:23.888 --> 01:42:25.307
and uncertain loyalty.

01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:27.392
One of them just tried to meet
with the president.

01:42:27.475 --> 01:42:30.562
Now, we need these men,
but as soon as it's practical,

01:42:30.645 --> 01:42:32.939
we should sever any such scientists
from the program.

01:42:33.023 --> 01:42:34.274
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

01:42:35.859 --> 01:42:37.539
[Marshall]
If a Russian bomb is inevitable,

01:42:38.236 --> 01:42:41.281
perhaps we should invite
their top scientists to Trinity?

01:42:41.364 --> 01:42:44.951
President Truman has no intention
of raising expectations

01:42:45.035 --> 01:42:47.704
that Stalin be included
in the atomic project.

01:42:47.787 --> 01:42:49.247
Informing him of our breakthrough

01:42:49.331 --> 01:42:51.249
and presenting it
as a means to win the war

01:42:51.333 --> 01:42:53.126
need not make unkeepable promises.

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:55.337
But the Potsdam peace conference in July

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:58.757
will be President Truman's last chance
to have that conversation.

01:42:59.466 --> 01:43:01.301
Can you give us a working bomb by then?

01:43:02.677 --> 01:43:05.889
Absolutely. We will test fire
before the conference.

01:43:10.769 --> 01:43:16.983
Ground Zero, observation posts
at 10,000 yards north, south and west.

01:43:17.067 --> 01:43:18.068
Where do we trigger from?

01:43:18.151 --> 01:43:20.236
South, 10,000.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.573
And Base Camp is ten miles south here.

01:43:23.656 --> 01:43:28.912
And there's a further observation post
on... on that hill 20 miles away.

01:43:28.995 --> 01:43:31.915
What's that, Frank?
Trigger lines already went in.

01:43:31.998 --> 01:43:35.460
The Air Force requested
a line of lights for their B-29.

01:43:35.543 --> 01:43:37.879
What B-29? Our bomb's on the tower.

01:43:37.962 --> 01:43:41.049
They wanna use the test
to confirm a safe operating distance.

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:43.843
- That's risky.
- Not as risky as dropping one over Japan

01:43:43.927 --> 01:43:45.946
and hoping that we were right
about the blast radius.

01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:48.139
Don't let them slow us down.
We're firing on the 15th.

01:43:48.223 --> 01:43:50.517
- The 15th? That's not...
- [Groves] The 15th.

01:43:52.227 --> 01:43:53.228
The 15th.

01:43:54.604 --> 01:43:56.624
[Oppenheimer] So I'll be here
at South Observation point

01:43:56.648 --> 01:43:58.942
with Frank and Kistiakowsky.

01:43:59.025 --> 01:44:02.779
You'll all be assigned
to Base Camp, West Observation,

01:44:02.862 --> 01:44:04.447
or Far Observation.

01:44:14.374 --> 01:44:18.294
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Careful with the knife. There, carefully.

01:44:19.796 --> 01:44:23.842
- Are those safe distances?
- They're based on your calculations.

01:44:23.925 --> 01:44:26.469
Time to stand behind your science, Hans.
Literally.

01:44:50.076 --> 01:44:51.119
Yeah.

01:44:56.416 --> 01:44:58.084
What about the radiation cloud?

01:44:58.168 --> 01:45:01.296
Without high winds, it should settle
within two to three miles.

01:45:01.379 --> 01:45:03.590
Evacuation measures are in place.
[inhales]

01:45:03.673 --> 01:45:06.468
But we need good weather for visibility,
so it has to be fine.

01:45:07.927 --> 01:45:09.262
Everybody out.

01:45:19.439 --> 01:45:21.399
We go on the night of the 15th.

01:45:21.483 --> 01:45:25.445
It's a hard deadline,
so if anyone has anything, speak now.

01:45:25.528 --> 01:45:27.697
Little, little more. Okay, stop, stop.

01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:31.576
Everybody, mattresses.
Put the mattress underneath.

01:45:48.843 --> 01:45:51.346
Could use a final implosion test.

01:45:53.389 --> 01:45:55.683
- It couldn't hurt.
- Do it.

01:45:56.935 --> 01:45:59.145
Is there anything else that might stop us?

01:45:59.229 --> 01:46:00.438
[thunderclap]

01:46:02.732 --> 01:46:05.109
[sheets flapping]

01:46:34.013 --> 01:46:35.557
It's happening, isn't it?

01:46:37.725 --> 01:46:39.143
I'll send a message.

01:46:39.894 --> 01:46:41.312
If it's gone our way...

01:46:42.939 --> 01:46:43.982
take in the sheets.

01:46:48.152 --> 01:46:49.195
Robert.

01:46:52.407 --> 01:46:53.449
Break a leg.

01:47:06.796 --> 01:47:07.797
Okay.

01:47:59.932 --> 01:48:03.102
[Fermi] Oppie's taken
a very modest three kilotons.

01:48:03.186 --> 01:48:05.438
- Teller's in with 45.
- [Rabi] Twenty.

01:48:05.521 --> 01:48:07.774
20,000 tons of TNT.

01:48:07.857 --> 01:48:11.152
And does anyone want the side action
on atmospheric ignition?

01:48:11.235 --> 01:48:13.112
[laughter]

01:48:13.905 --> 01:48:17.075
- Are you saying we'll have to delay?
- I'm saying it would be prudent.

01:48:17.158 --> 01:48:18.951
This weather,
has it reached the site?

01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:23.998
[phone ringing]

01:48:24.082 --> 01:48:26.250
Bethe is calling to tell you
the implosion test failed.

01:48:26.334 --> 01:48:28.878
Hello, Hans. Yes, he's here.

01:48:30.171 --> 01:48:31.172
Yes.

01:48:32.590 --> 01:48:33.651
[handset settles in cradle]

01:48:33.675 --> 01:48:35.301
- Is he wrong?
- No.

01:48:35.385 --> 01:48:37.136
-No?

01:48:38.137 --> 01:48:40.598
- So we're about to fire a dud?
- No.

01:48:40.682 --> 01:48:44.060
- Explain.
- Well, I can't. I just... I just know.

01:48:44.143 --> 01:48:45.853
I know the implosion lenses will work.

01:48:45.937 --> 01:48:48.377
If we fire these detonators
and they don't trigger a reaction,

01:48:48.439 --> 01:48:52.068
two years' worth of plutonium
will be scattered across White Sands.

01:48:52.151 --> 01:48:54.779
A month of my salary
against ten bucks says it lights.

01:48:55.571 --> 01:48:56.571
Jesus.

01:49:03.788 --> 01:49:05.891
[weatherman] The wind's picking up
at Zero, not the rain.

01:49:05.915 --> 01:49:06.999
Lightning circling.

01:49:07.083 --> 01:49:08.876
You think it might be time
to tell your men

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.629
to get away from the steel tower
with the atomic bomb?

01:49:11.713 --> 01:49:14.841
[laughter]

01:49:14.924 --> 01:49:17.552
- Let's get to South Observation.
- Pull 'em out.

01:49:17.635 --> 01:49:19.721
[Oppenheimer]
We can make our determination there.

01:49:21.639 --> 01:49:22.849
[thunderclap]

01:49:24.892 --> 01:49:27.019
[Oppenheimer]
The team hasn't slept in two nights.

01:49:27.103 --> 01:49:30.440
If we stand down, make the bomb safe,
we won't be back here for weeks.

01:49:30.523 --> 01:49:34.235
Then we'll miss Potsdam.
I gotta get word to Truman by 7:00.

01:49:34.318 --> 01:49:36.279
Our window's closing.
What is this doing?

01:49:36.362 --> 01:49:37.739
Raining, blowing, lightning.

01:49:37.822 --> 01:49:39.991
- For how long, damn it?
- It's holdin' strong.

01:49:40.074 --> 01:49:42.243
- It'll break before dawn.
- How could you know that?

01:49:42.326 --> 01:49:44.328
I know this desert.
Storm cools overnight.

01:49:44.412 --> 01:49:46.456
Just before dawn, the storm breaks.

01:49:46.539 --> 01:49:48.708
He could be right,
but schedule as late as possible.

01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:50.042
5:30.

01:49:50.126 --> 01:49:52.462
Sign your forecast.
If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

01:49:52.545 --> 01:49:54.756
- Frank, tell them all, 5:30.
- 5:30.

01:49:54.839 --> 01:49:56.007
- 5-30.
- 5:30.

01:49:58.676 --> 01:50:00.386
Three years,

01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:01.804
4,000 people,

01:50:01.888 --> 01:50:03.598
two billion dollars.

01:50:03.681 --> 01:50:05.975
Well, if it doesn't go off,

01:50:06.058 --> 01:50:07.351
we're both finished.

01:50:08.227 --> 01:50:10.188
[thunder rumbling]

01:50:10.271 --> 01:50:12.899
I'm betting on three kilotons.

01:50:12.982 --> 01:50:14.817
Anything less,
they won't get what it is.

01:50:15.818 --> 01:50:19.155
What did Fermi mean
by "atmospheric ignition"?

01:50:19.238 --> 01:50:20.281
Well, we had a moment

01:50:20.364 --> 01:50:24.452
where it looked like the chain reaction
from an atomic device might never stop.

01:50:25.286 --> 01:50:27.371
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

01:50:27.455 --> 01:50:29.916
Why is Fermi still taking side bets on it?

01:50:30.625 --> 01:50:32.585
Call it gallows humor.

01:50:35.421 --> 01:50:40.051
Wait, are we saying there's a chance
that when we push that button,

01:50:40.134 --> 01:50:41.469
we destroy the world?

01:50:41.552 --> 01:50:45.264
Nothing in our research over three years
supports that conclusion.

01:50:45.348 --> 01:50:48.100
Except as the most remote possibility.

01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:51.020
- How remote?
- Chances are near zero.

01:50:52.605 --> 01:50:53.606
Near zero.

01:50:54.899 --> 01:50:57.235
What do you want from theory alone?

01:50:57.318 --> 01:50:58.319
[scoffs]

01:50:59.070 --> 01:51:00.947
Zero would be nice.

01:51:04.367 --> 01:51:10.331
In exactly one hour, 58 minutes,
we'll know.

01:51:17.129 --> 01:51:18.256
It's letting up.

01:51:31.227 --> 01:51:33.479
The arming party's left Zero,
they're heading this way.

01:51:33.563 --> 01:51:34.563
Throwing the switches.

01:51:34.605 --> 01:51:37.859
Turn the cars.
Ready for emergency evacuation.

01:51:37.942 --> 01:51:39.944
[wind howling]

01:51:55.585 --> 01:51:56.937
[soldier] Take your welder's glass.

01:51:56.961 --> 01:51:58.504
Everybody, take your places.

01:51:59.171 --> 01:52:01.007
Everybody take a welder's glass!

01:52:02.758 --> 01:52:04.594
Everybody take a welder's glass.

01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:56.187
[timer ticking]

01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:57.480
Twenty minutes.

01:53:01.484 --> 01:53:02.610
[Fermi] Twenty minutes.

01:53:13.788 --> 01:53:15.122
[Feynman] That's 20.

01:53:18.334 --> 01:53:19.710
On the leg, please.

01:53:21.295 --> 01:53:23.130
- Feynman.
- No.

01:53:23.214 --> 01:53:25.883
- For your eyes, sir.
- The glass stops the UV.

01:53:25.967 --> 01:53:27.510
And what stops the glass?

01:53:29.261 --> 01:53:31.764
I'm gonna head to Base Camp.
Best of luck.

01:53:32.473 --> 01:53:33.933
Robert...

01:53:35.142 --> 01:53:36.602
try not to blow up the world.

01:53:48.489 --> 01:53:49.657
Watch that needle.

01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:53.202
If the detonators don't charge,
or the voltage drops below one volt,

01:53:53.285 --> 01:53:54.787
you hit that button, you abort.

01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:56.455
Understood?

01:53:56.539 --> 01:53:57.707
Understood.

01:54:05.089 --> 01:54:07.425
[soldier on loudspeaker]
Two minutes to detonation.

01:54:07.508 --> 01:54:09.427
Everybody down.

01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:13.597
Do not turn around until you see light
reflected on the hills.

01:54:13.681 --> 01:54:16.600
Then look at the explosion
only through your welder's glass.

01:54:16.684 --> 01:54:18.894
[on loudspeaker]
Ninety seconds to detonation.

01:54:19.562 --> 01:54:20.855
[static on radio]

01:54:20.938 --> 01:54:23.691
[on radio]
Eighty seconds to detonation.

01:54:23.774 --> 01:54:25.151
Is it rubbed in?

01:54:25.901 --> 01:54:26.902
Yeah.

01:54:33.784 --> 01:54:36.704
[on radio]
Sixty seconds to detonation.

01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:53.721
These things are hard on your heart.

01:54:53.804 --> 01:54:55.084
[on loudspeaker] Thirty seconds.

01:54:58.059 --> 01:54:59.518
[light buzzes]

01:55:00.561 --> 01:55:01.812
Detonator's charged.

01:55:12.156 --> 01:55:16.577
[on loudspeaker] 77, 76, 15...

01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:23.042
14, 13, 12, 11...

01:55:23.542 --> 01:55:24.710
Ten...

01:55:24.794 --> 01:55:26.087
[detonator hums]

01:55:28.255 --> 01:55:29.423
eight...

01:55:30.216 --> 01:55:31.425
seven...

SIX...

01:55:43.145 --> 01:55:44.313
two...

01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:47.024
one.

01:55:50.694 --> 01:55:52.363
[Oppenheimer breathing deeply]

01:56:00.538 --> 01:56:01.914

[Oppenheimer] âAnd now I am become Death.â

01:57:24.622 --> 01:57:26.248

[shock wave thunders]

[shock wave thunders]

[shock wave thunders]

01:57:57.446 --> 01:57:58.864
[objects rattling]

01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:00.741
It worked.

01:58:08.082 --> 01:58:10.501
[scattered laughter]

01:58:10.584 --> 01:58:12.211

[Kistiakowsky cheers]

01:58:36.443 --> 01:58:38.362
- You owe me ten dollars!
- Oh!

01:58:38.445 --> 01:58:40.531
[both laughing]

01:58:40.614 --> 01:58:41.740
Come on!

01:58:41.824 --> 01:58:44.285
I... I'm good for it, Kisty. [laughs]

01:58:44.368 --> 01:58:45.452
You are. [laughs]

01:58:46.203 --> 01:58:48.330
Yes, you are! [laughs]

01:58:48.414 --> 01:58:50.874

[chattering]

01:59:16.483 --> 01:59:18.902
We did it! Well done.

01:59:25.034 --> 01:59:26.744
[Groves] Get me Potsdam right away.

01:59:38.255 --> 01:59:40.924
- Get a message to Kitty.
- We can't say anything.

01:59:41.008 --> 01:59:42.301
Tell her to take in the sheets.

01:59:52.353 --> 01:59:54.355
- [baby screaming]
- [phone ringing]

01:59:56.899 --> 01:59:58.025
Shh.

01:59:58.108 --> 01:59:59.693
- Hello?
- [Charlotte] Hi. Kitty?

01:59:59.777 --> 02:00:02.905
What... What? Charlotte.
Charlotte, go ahead, go ahead.

02:00:02.988 --> 02:00:07.284
Oh, um, well, I don't know, he just said
to tell you to "bring in the sheets."

02:00:10.204 --> 02:00:11.205
Kitty?

02:00:12.915 --> 02:00:15.376
Kitty? Kitty, are you still there?

02:00:22.549 --> 02:00:25.594
If they detonate it too high in the air,
the blast won't be as powerful.

02:00:25.677 --> 02:00:28.097
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer,

02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:29.473
we'll take it from here.

02:00:40.067 --> 02:00:42.444
Did Truman brief Stalin at Potsdam?

02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:45.572
A brief would be an overstatement.

02:00:45.656 --> 02:00:49.368
He referred to a powerful new weapon.

02:00:50.035 --> 02:00:54.832
Stalin hoped we'd use it
against Japan.

02:00:56.083 --> 02:00:57.084
That's it?

02:00:57.751 --> 02:00:59.711
Robert, we've given them an ace,

02:00:59.795 --> 02:01:01.296
it's for them to play the hand.

02:01:03.298 --> 02:01:04.716
You're aiming for the 6th?

02:01:05.342 --> 02:01:07.678
Well, it's up to the CO
in the Pacific.

02:01:09.221 --> 02:01:10.848
Should I come with you
to Washington?

02:01:12.641 --> 02:01:13.767
What for?

02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:17.813
Well, you'll keep me informed.

02:01:19.148 --> 02:01:20.149
Of course.

02:01:22.401 --> 02:01:23.569
As best I can.

02:01:23.652 --> 02:01:26.864
- [truck engine starts]

02:01:28.615 --> 02:01:30.409
[chains rattling]

02:01:41.753 --> 02:01:44.423
Would the Japanese surrender
if they knew what was coming?

02:01:45.674 --> 02:01:46.884
I don't know.

02:01:49.636 --> 02:01:51.638
[Teller] Have you seen Szilard's petition?

02:01:51.722 --> 02:01:54.099
What the hell does Szilard know
about the Japanese?

02:01:54.183 --> 02:01:55.517
You're not signing it, are you?

02:01:56.518 --> 02:01:58.770
Many people have. A lot of people have.

02:01:58.854 --> 02:02:00.022
Edward,

02:02:01.482 --> 02:02:03.358
the fact that we built this bomb

02:02:03.442 --> 02:02:06.069
does not give us any more right
or responsibility

02:02:06.153 --> 02:02:08.363
to decide how it's used than anyone else.

02:02:08.447 --> 02:02:10.491
But we're the only people
who know about it.

02:02:11.074 --> 02:02:14.036
I've told Stimson the various opinions
of the community.

02:02:14.119 --> 02:02:15.204
But what's your opinion?

02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:18.040
Once it's used...

02:02:19.333 --> 02:02:22.878
nuclear war, perhaps all war...

02:02:24.463 --> 02:02:25.923
becomes unthinkable.

02:02:26.507 --> 02:02:28.634
Until somebody builds a bigger bomb.

02:02:49.613 --> 02:02:51.198
I thought they would call.

02:02:51.281 --> 02:02:52.741
It's only the 5th.

02:02:55.244 --> 02:02:56.912
In Japan, it's the 6th.

02:03:09.967 --> 02:03:10.968
Charlotte.

02:03:13.595 --> 02:03:15.055
Try Groves.

02:03:16.098 --> 02:03:17.099
Anything?

02:03:19.226 --> 02:03:20.769
Charlotte?

02:03:20.852 --> 02:03:22.212
[Charlotte] Truman's on the radio.

02:03:23.355 --> 02:03:25.274
[Truman on radio] Sixteen hours ago,

02:03:26.191 --> 02:03:31.321
an American airplane
dropped one bomb on Hiroshima...

02:03:31.405 --> 02:03:32.906
[feedback squealing]

02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:36.118
[on loudspeaker] ...and destroyed
ifs usefulness to the enemy.

02:03:36.201 --> 02:03:38.203
[soldiers cheering]

02:03:38.287 --> 02:03:44.001
The bomb had more power
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

02:03:46.253 --> 02:03:48.171
It is an atomic bomb.

02:03:48.255 --> 02:03:50.924
- [truck horns honking]
- [soldiers cheering]

02:03:51.008 --> 02:03:55.637
It is a harnessing
of the basic power of the universe.

02:03:57.848 --> 02:03:58.888
[Charlotte] Groves on one.

02:03:58.932 --> 02:04:00.892
[Truman] We are now prepared to destroy,

02:04:00.976 --> 02:04:04.438
more rapidly and completely,
the Japanese...

02:04:04.521 --> 02:04:06.273
[clears throat] General?

02:04:06.356 --> 02:04:09.151
[Groves] I'm very proud of you
and all of your people.

02:04:09.234 --> 02:04:10.736
It went all right?

02:04:10.819 --> 02:04:13.113
Apparently,
it went with a tremendous bang.

02:04:14.364 --> 02:04:18.160
Well, everyone here
is feeling reasonably good about it.

02:04:20.078 --> 02:04:21.538
It's been a long road.

02:04:21.622 --> 02:04:24.207
I Think one of the wisest things
I ever did

02:04:24.291 --> 02:04:26.543
was when I selected the director
of Los Alamos.

02:04:27.419 --> 02:04:29.671
- [horn honking]
- [cheering]

02:04:29.755 --> 02:04:33.759
[Truman] We have spent
more than two billion dollars

02:04:33.842 --> 02:04:37.554
on the greatest scientific gamble
in history,

02:04:38.221 --> 02:04:40.098
and we have won.

02:04:40.974 --> 02:04:43.435
[cheering]

02:04:44.645 --> 02:04:48.231
[all] Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:04:48.315 --> 02:04:51.860
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:04:51.943 --> 02:04:55.280
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:04:55.364 --> 02:04:58.408
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:04:58.492 --> 02:05:01.411
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:05:01.495 --> 02:05:04.373
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:05:04.456 --> 02:05:06.833
[cheering, applauding]

02:05:06.917 --> 02:05:09.127
[feet stamping]

02:05:12.005 --> 02:05:14.007
[stamping intensifies]

02:05:30.982 --> 02:05:33.985
[cheering, whistling]

02:05:38.407 --> 02:05:39.616
[whooping]

02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:09.479
The world...

02:06:11.356 --> 02:06:12.566
will remember this day.

02:06:12.649 --> 02:06:15.026
[cheering]

02:06:23.618 --> 02:06:25.829
[rumbling]

02:06:32.002 --> 02:06:33.503
It's too soon to...

02:06:34.129 --> 02:06:37.883
It's too soon to determine
what the results of the bombing are.

02:06:40.969 --> 02:06:42.763
But I'll bet the Japanese didn't like it.

02:06:42.846 --> 02:06:44.014
[cheering]

02:06:51.646 --> 02:06:53.148
[person screaming]

02:06:54.858 --> 02:06:57.152
[no audible dialogue]

02:06:58.862 --> 02:07:01.031
[no audible dialogue]

02:07:03.658 --> 02:07:05.202
I'm so proud.

02:07:06.286 --> 02:07:08.205
So proud of what you have accomplished.

02:07:08.288 --> 02:07:09.790
[no audible dialogue]

02:07:15.879 --> 02:07:18.465
I just wish we had it in time
to use against the Germans.

02:07:18.548 --> 02:07:20.091
[no audible dialogue]

02:07:41.196 --> 02:07:43.824
- [laughing, distorted]
- [crowd cheering]

02:07:48.745 --> 02:07:51.164
[laughing]

02:08:06.805 --> 02:08:08.723
[sobbing]

02:08:08.807 --> 02:08:11.017
[scream, distorted]

02:08:29.035 --> 02:08:32.038
[sobbing]

02:08:32.122 --> 02:08:33.748
[laughter]

02:08:37.168 --> 02:08:39.170
[distorted wailing continues]

02:09:03.778 --> 02:09:05.780
[footsteps approaching]

02:09:08.408 --> 02:09:09.743
Dr. Oppenheimer?

02:09:10.869 --> 02:09:12.037
Dr. Oppenheimer?

02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:13.121
[chuckles]

02:09:13.204 --> 02:09:14.289
Nice picture.

02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:16.750
President Truman will see you now.

02:09:31.056 --> 02:09:33.808
Dr. Oppenheimer. It's an honor.

02:09:33.892 --> 02:09:35.769
- Mr. President.
- Please.

02:09:35.852 --> 02:09:37.020
Thank you.

02:09:37.646 --> 02:09:38.772
Secretary Byrnes.

02:09:41.441 --> 02:09:44.152
How's it feel to be the most famous man
in the world?

02:09:45.278 --> 02:09:47.948
You helped save a lot of American lives.

02:09:48.615 --> 02:09:52.911
- What we did at Hiroshima was a...
- And Nagasaki.

02:09:53.745 --> 02:09:54.996
Well, obviously.

02:09:55.872 --> 02:09:58.959
Your invention
let us bring our boys home.

02:09:59.042 --> 02:10:01.169
Well, it was hardly...

02:10:01.252 --> 02:10:02.253
my invention.

02:10:02.337 --> 02:10:04.464
It was you on the cover of Time.

02:10:04.547 --> 02:10:07.509
[Truman, Byrnes laughing]

02:10:07.592 --> 02:10:11.262
Jim tells me you're concerned
about an arms race with the Soviets.

02:10:11.346 --> 02:10:12.347
Oh, yes, uh...

02:10:13.932 --> 02:10:15.225
Well, um...

02:10:15.308 --> 02:10:16.643
It's that, uh,

02:10:16.726 --> 02:10:19.813
now is our chance to secure...

02:10:20.730 --> 02:10:23.566
international cooperation on...
[clears throat] ...atomic energy

02:10:23.650 --> 02:10:25.819
a-a-and I'm concerned...

02:10:25.902 --> 02:10:28.780
Do you know when the Soviets
are gonna have the bomb?

02:10:28.863 --> 02:10:30.699
I don't think I could give a precise...

02:10:30.782 --> 02:10:32.033
Never.

02:10:32.867 --> 02:10:34.411
Never.

02:10:34.494 --> 02:10:37.789
Mr. President,
the Russians have good physicists

02:10:37.872 --> 02:10:40.417
- a-a-and abundant resources.
- Abundant?

02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:41.501
- [Truman chuckles]
- Yes.

02:10:42.252 --> 02:10:44.295
- Don't think so.
- [chuckles]

02:10:44.379 --> 02:10:47.924
Well, they'll put
everything they have in...

02:10:51.761 --> 02:10:56.516
I hear you're leaving Los Alamos.
[sniffles]

02:10:56.599 --> 02:10:57.851
What should we do with it?

02:10:57.934 --> 02:11:00.061
Give it back to the Indians.

02:11:07.736 --> 02:11:10.989
Um, Dr. Oppenheimer,

02:11:11.072 --> 02:11:14.200
if what you say about the Soviets is true,

02:11:14.284 --> 02:11:18.371
we have to build up Los Alamos,
not shut it down.

02:11:22.083 --> 02:11:23.668
Mr. President...

02:11:24.878 --> 02:11:26.004
Um...

02:11:29.090 --> 02:11:32.802
I feel that I have blood on my hands.

02:11:52.530 --> 02:11:57.786
You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki

02:11:57.869 --> 02:12:00.789
gives a shit who built the bomb?

02:12:04.125 --> 02:12:06.503
They care who dropped it.

02:12:07.295 --> 02:12:08.296
I did.

02:12:11.216 --> 02:12:13.676
Hiroshima isn't about you.

02:12:20.141 --> 02:12:21.434
Dr. Oppenheimer.

02:12:25.230 --> 02:12:26.231
[clears throat]

02:12:33.071 --> 02:12:35.281
Don't let that crybaby
back in here.

02:12:40.912 --> 02:12:43.957
[Strauss] Robert saw that hand-wringing
got him nowhere.

02:12:44.791 --> 02:12:46.126
By the time I met him,

02:12:46.209 --> 02:12:49.838
he'd fully embraced
his "father of the bomb" reputation.

02:12:49.921 --> 02:12:52.257
And he used his profile
to influence policy.

02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:53.925
[chattering]

02:12:59.305 --> 02:13:00.306
[camera shutter clicks]

02:13:01.182 --> 02:13:03.184
[Robb]
Doctor, in the years following the war,

02:13:03.268 --> 02:13:05.353
would you say
that you exerted a great influence

02:13:05.436 --> 02:13:07.313
on the atomic policies of the USA?

02:13:07.397 --> 02:13:09.941
[Oppenheimer]
! think "greatâ would be an overstatement.

02:13:10.024 --> 02:13:11.919
[Robb] Really?
If we look at the issue of isotopes,

02:13:11.943 --> 02:13:15.572
were you not personally responsible for
destroying all opposition to their export?

02:13:15.655 --> 02:13:18.074
- You could use a bottle of beer...
- [gallery laughing]

02:13:18.158 --> 02:13:19.358
when making atomic weapons.

02:13:19.409 --> 02:13:20.410
In fact, you do.

02:13:20.493 --> 02:13:21.870
I was the spokesman,

02:13:21.953 --> 02:13:24.455
but the opinion among scientists
was unanimous.

02:13:24.539 --> 02:13:27.625
All along with McCarthy on the rise,
he knew he was vulnerable.

02:13:28.501 --> 02:13:32.172
His brother was blacklisted
by every university in the country.

02:13:33.673 --> 02:13:36.801
Lomanitz wound up working
the railroad, laying track.

02:13:38.511 --> 02:13:40.763
And Chevalier went into exile.

02:13:42.599 --> 02:13:46.477
But none of that stopped Robert
from pushing the GAC

02:13:46.561 --> 02:13:48.980
to recommend arms control
instead of the H-bomb.

02:13:51.316 --> 02:13:54.569
He was devastated when Truman
rejected their recommendation.

02:13:56.696 --> 02:13:58.364
I miss Richard more than I can bear.

02:13:58.448 --> 02:14:00.450
I know, Ruth, I know.

02:14:00.533 --> 02:14:03.620
Part of me's glad he didn't live to see
where this is all going.

02:14:06.873 --> 02:14:08.791
Here comes the birthday boy.

02:14:08.875 --> 02:14:10.001
To gloat.

02:14:10.084 --> 02:14:11.794
Have fun.

02:14:11.878 --> 02:14:13.838
Robert, uh, my son and his fiancÃ©e

02:14:13.922 --> 02:14:16.317
are desperate to meet
the father of the atomic bomb, and so...

02:14:16.341 --> 02:14:18.426
Well... good day.

02:14:25.475 --> 02:14:26.768
Is this a bad time?

02:14:27.435 --> 02:14:28.645
What do you think, Lewis?

02:14:29.229 --> 02:14:31.356
Well, I think it must have been
a blow for you.

02:14:31.439 --> 02:14:32.482
For the world.

02:14:34.108 --> 02:14:37.111
The world? What does Fuchs mean
to the rest of the world?

02:14:38.655 --> 02:14:40.073
Fuchs?

02:14:40.156 --> 02:14:41.532
Klaus Fuchs?

02:14:43.201 --> 02:14:45.411
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

02:14:48.623 --> 02:14:50.667
Klaus Fuchs, the British scientist

02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:53.294
that you put onto the implosion team
at Los Alamos...

02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:59.175
turns out he was spying for the Soviets
the whole time.

02:14:59.259 --> 02:15:00.468
I'm sorry.

02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:08.935
[Strauss]
After the truth about Fuchs came out.,

02:15:09.018 --> 02:15:11.020
the FBI stepped up surveillance on him.

02:15:11.104 --> 02:15:13.690
He knew his phone was tapped,

02:15:13.773 --> 02:15:15.566
he was followed everywhere,

02:15:16.359 --> 02:15:17.986
his trash picked through.

02:15:21.197 --> 02:15:25.410
- But never stopped speaking his mind.
- A man of conviction.

02:15:25.493 --> 02:15:28.413
And maybe he thought fame
could actually protect him.

02:15:30.665 --> 02:15:33.543
When Eisenhower took office,
he saw one more chance.

02:15:35.086 --> 02:15:36.087
He took it.

02:15:36.170 --> 02:15:42.885
America and Russia may be likened
to two scorpions in a bottle,

02:15:42.969 --> 02:15:49.225
each capable of killing the other,
but only at the risk of his own life.

02:15:49.809 --> 02:15:51.936
Now, there are various aspects
of this policy...

02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:57.025
(Strauss) Lot of scientists blame me,
but how was I supposed to protect him?

02:15:57.108 --> 02:16:00.528
Are too secret for discussion,
candor is the only remedy.

02:16:00.611 --> 02:16:04.198
Officials in Washington need to start
leveling with the American people.

02:16:04.282 --> 02:16:05.992
[murmuring]

02:16:06.075 --> 02:16:08.745
That was the last straw
for Robert's enemies.

02:16:08.828 --> 02:16:10.830
So he had to lose his security clearance?

02:16:10.913 --> 02:16:13.499
- And with it, his credibility.
- [knocks on window]

02:16:13.583 --> 02:16:15.835
But how could they do it?

02:16:15.918 --> 02:16:19.005
He was a war hero.
He'd already told everyone about his past.

02:16:19.088 --> 02:16:21.299
Borden dredged it all up.

02:16:21.382 --> 02:16:24.552
How could Borden get access
to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

02:16:24.635 --> 02:16:28.431
- Could it have been Nichols?
- No, I can't imagine he'd do that.

02:16:28.514 --> 02:16:30.516
But whoever did unleashed a firestorm

02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:34.979
that burned a path from the White House
back to my desk at the AEC.

02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:37.106
You see him in there, right?

02:16:37.857 --> 02:16:40.151
I've worked my whole life to get here,

02:16:40.943 --> 02:16:43.154
Cabinet of the United States of America,

02:16:43.237 --> 02:16:46.783
and now, in front of the entire country,
they're gonna put me back in my place.

02:16:48.618 --> 02:16:50.286
A lowly shoe salesman.

02:16:50.995 --> 02:16:53.122
Lewis, we can win this thing.

02:16:53.206 --> 02:16:56.292
I-1 think we can get the Senate
to grasp that you did your duty,

02:16:56.376 --> 02:16:58.002
painful though it was.

02:16:58.086 --> 02:17:00.546
- Now, will Hill's testimony back us up?
- Hill will be fine.

02:17:00.630 --> 02:17:01.631
I don't really know him,

02:17:01.714 --> 02:17:04.008
but he was one of Szilard's boys
in Chicago,

02:17:04.092 --> 02:17:05.593
and they never forgave Robert

02:17:05.676 --> 02:17:07.970
for not supporting the petition
against bombing Japan.

02:17:08.054 --> 02:17:09.138
[projector clicks]

02:17:09.222 --> 02:17:12.683
[Morrison] This was taken
31 days after the bombing.

02:17:13.601 --> 02:17:17.897
Virtually everyone in the street
for nearly a mile around,

02:17:18.606 --> 02:17:21.776
was instantly and seriously burned.

02:17:21.859 --> 02:17:22.944
[audience gasping]

02:17:23.027 --> 02:17:27.782
[Morrison] The Japanese spoke of people
who wore striped clothing

02:17:27.865 --> 02:17:30.493
upon whom, the skin was burned in stripes.

02:17:31.661 --> 02:17:34.205
There were many
who thought themselves lucky,

02:17:34.288 --> 02:17:38.167
who climbed out of the ruins
of their homes, only slightly injured.

02:17:39.919 --> 02:17:41.462
But they died anyway.

02:17:42.422 --> 02:17:46.759
They died days or weeks later
from the radium-like rays

02:17:46.843 --> 02:17:50.721
emitted in great numbers
at the moment of the explosion.

02:17:52.056 --> 02:17:54.142
Did you read
this crap in the papers?

02:17:54.225 --> 02:17:56.227
A British physicist is saying

02:17:56.310 --> 02:17:59.230
the atomic bombings
were not the last act of World War II,

02:17:59.313 --> 02:18:02.191
but the first act of this cold war
with Russia.

02:18:02.275 --> 02:18:03.693
Which physicist?

02:18:03.776 --> 02:18:06.446
I think you knew him.
Patrick Blackett.

02:18:07.947 --> 02:18:09.240
[scoffs]

02:18:09.323 --> 02:18:10.825
He may not be wrong.

02:18:10.908 --> 02:18:12.368
Stimson is now telling me

02:18:12.452 --> 02:18:15.621
we bombed an enemy
that was essentially defeated.

02:18:15.705 --> 02:18:18.207
Robert, you've all the influence now.

02:18:19.041 --> 02:18:20.585
Please.

02:18:20.668 --> 02:18:22.962
Urge them to continue my research
on the Super.

02:18:23.045 --> 02:18:25.173
I neither can nor will, Edward.

02:18:25.256 --> 02:18:26.591
Why not?

02:18:26.674 --> 02:18:28.193
It's not the right use of our resources.

02:18:28.217 --> 02:18:30.303
Is that what you really believe?

02:18:31.095 --> 02:18:35.057
J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

02:18:36.392 --> 02:18:38.019
Nobody knows what you believe.

02:18:39.228 --> 02:18:41.022
Do you? Hmm?

02:18:41.522 --> 02:18:43.983
[Groves] One final time,
our program director,

02:18:44.066 --> 02:18:45.735
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

02:18:47.403 --> 02:18:49.614
[Oppenheimer]
I hope that, in years to come,

02:18:49.697 --> 02:18:52.241
you will look back on your work
here with pride.

02:18:53.034 --> 02:18:57.330
But today that pride must be tempered
with a profound concern.

02:18:59.165 --> 02:19:02.793
If atomic weapons are to be added
to the arsenals of a warring world,

02:19:04.253 --> 02:19:08.508
then the day will come when people
will curse the name of Los Alamos.

02:19:12.762 --> 02:19:15.348
Sorry, Admiral. Stopped off to get this.

02:19:16.516 --> 02:19:18.476
It seems pretty favorable.

02:19:19.268 --> 02:19:21.729
There's Oppenheimer. What's the caption?

02:19:21.812 --> 02:19:24.607
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer,
Strauss fought...

02:19:26.442 --> 02:19:27.693
and the US won."

02:19:28.861 --> 02:19:29.862
That'll work.

02:19:29.946 --> 02:19:32.365
Those were your words from the other day.

02:19:32.448 --> 02:19:33.699
We needed to pivot.

02:19:34.325 --> 02:19:36.911
But how would you know what
Time magazine's gonna write?

02:19:36.994 --> 02:19:38.579
Henry Luce is a friend.

02:19:46.546 --> 02:19:48.756
You sat here
and let me tell you how it's done,

02:19:49.507 --> 02:19:51.634
but you've been far ahead all along.

02:19:51.717 --> 02:19:54.053
Survival in Washington

02:19:54.929 --> 02:19:57.139
is about knowing how to get things done.

02:19:57.640 --> 02:19:58.641
Right.

02:20:00.768 --> 02:20:02.603
What was it you said about Borden?

02:20:02.687 --> 02:20:04.772
"Why get caught
holding the knife yourself?"

02:20:06.899 --> 02:20:09.944
I'm beginning to think Borden
was holding the knife for you.

02:20:12.446 --> 02:20:16.659
It's gonna come down to how much influence
Borden's been able to exert on Teller.

02:20:16.742 --> 02:20:17.785
[Kitty laughing]

02:20:17.868 --> 02:20:19.263
[attorney]
Did I say something funny?

02:20:19.287 --> 02:20:23.874
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden"
when we all know that it's Strauss.

02:20:23.958 --> 02:20:26.419
Lewis brought me to Princeton, Kitty.

02:20:26.502 --> 02:20:29.213
And then you humiliated him
in front of Congress.

02:20:29.297 --> 02:20:31.799
- But more useful than a sandwich.
- [gallery laughing]

02:20:35.052 --> 02:20:36.053
How'd I do?

02:20:37.305 --> 02:20:39.098
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

02:20:39.181 --> 02:20:40.725
That was six years ago.

02:20:40.808 --> 02:20:44.353
You know the truly vindictive,
patient as saints.

02:20:44.437 --> 02:20:47.106
Strauss has been perfectly clear
that he is neutral.

02:20:47.189 --> 02:20:50.651
- [glass shatters]
- Wake up! It is Strauss!

02:20:50.735 --> 02:20:53.696
It's always been Strauss, and you know it.

02:20:53.779 --> 02:20:55.406
Why won't you fight him?

02:20:56.115 --> 02:20:57.283
Christ's sake.

02:20:58.659 --> 02:21:02.455
It wasn't Nichols, or Hoover,
or one of Truman's guys.

02:21:02.538 --> 02:21:04.915
It was you. You gave the file to Borden.

02:21:04.999 --> 02:21:07.293
You set him on Oppenheimer.
You convinced him to...

02:21:07.376 --> 02:21:11.797
Borden didn't take any convincing.

02:21:11.881 --> 02:21:13.716
Take your time, use the entire file.

02:21:13.799 --> 02:21:16.135
Write up your conclusions,
send them to the FBI.

02:21:16.218 --> 02:21:20.556
The material is obviously extensive,
but there's nothing new here.

02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:22.725
[Strauss] Your conclusions will be.

02:21:22.808 --> 02:21:24.852
And they'll have to be answered.

02:21:24.935 --> 02:21:26.687
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

02:21:26.771 --> 02:21:30.149
Oppenheimer's too slippery
for that self-promoting clown.

02:21:30.232 --> 02:21:33.027
I've talked it over with Hoover,
he'll hold McCarthy at bay

02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:34.779
while you do this with the AEC.

02:21:34.862 --> 02:21:35.988
A trial.

02:21:36.072 --> 02:21:37.365
No. No trial.

02:21:37.448 --> 02:21:40.201
You can't give Oppenheimer a platform.

02:21:40.284 --> 02:21:42.119
You can't martyr him.

02:21:42.203 --> 02:21:45.456
We need a systematic destruction
of Oppenheimer's credibility

02:21:45.539 --> 02:21:48.876
So he can never again speak
on matters of national security.

02:21:49.669 --> 02:21:50.670
Then what?

02:21:52.338 --> 02:21:55.633
A shabby little room,
far from the limelight.

02:21:55.716 --> 02:21:57.259
[chattering]

02:22:01.430 --> 02:22:03.474
[Strauss]
A simple, bureaucratic procedure.

02:22:03.557 --> 02:22:05.893
His Q clearance is up for renewal.

02:22:05.976 --> 02:22:08.604
You send your accusations to the FBI...

02:22:10.898 --> 02:22:13.984
Hoover sends them to the AEC,
you're forced to act.

02:22:15.027 --> 02:22:16.278
You write up an indictment.

02:22:16.362 --> 02:22:20.324
You tell Oppenheimer his security
clearance is not being renewed.

02:22:20.408 --> 02:22:22.368
But offer him the chance to appeal.

02:22:22.451 --> 02:22:24.745
As you can see, Robert,
it's not yet signed.

02:22:24.829 --> 02:22:27.164
- May I keep this?
- No.

02:22:27.248 --> 02:22:30.960
If you do decide to appeal,
they'll have to send you a copy.

02:22:31.043 --> 02:22:34.672
When he appeals, and trust me, he will,

02:22:34.755 --> 02:22:36.757
- I appoint a board.
- [chattering]

02:22:36.841 --> 02:22:39.552
They will, of course, have counsel.

02:22:39.635 --> 02:22:41.303
- [Nichols] Prosecutor?
- In all but name.

02:22:41.387 --> 02:22:43.305
- Who?
- Roger Robb.

02:22:43.389 --> 02:22:44.390
Ouch.

02:22:44.473 --> 02:22:47.685
Robb will have security clearance
to examine Oppenheimer's file.

02:22:47.768 --> 02:22:49.103
As will the Gray board.

02:22:49.186 --> 02:22:50.438
Defense counsel will not.

02:22:51.731 --> 02:22:53.023
A closed hearing.

02:22:53.107 --> 02:22:57.278
"The so-called and derogatory information
in your indictment of me..."

02:22:57.361 --> 02:23:00.906
No audience.
No reporters. No burden of proof.

02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:02.992
No burden of proof?

02:23:04.618 --> 02:23:05.786
We're not convicting.

02:23:06.871 --> 02:23:08.497
We're just denying.

02:23:14.295 --> 02:23:16.255
What is it you said?

02:23:17.131 --> 02:23:20.468
"This is just how the game is played."

02:23:21.177 --> 02:23:22.928
Well, forgive my naivete.

02:23:23.596 --> 02:23:27.266
Amateurs seek the sun... get eaten.

02:23:28.601 --> 02:23:31.645
Power stays in the shadows.

02:23:31.729 --> 02:23:34.690
But, sir, you're out of the shadows now.

02:23:34.774 --> 02:23:36.734
Yeah, that's why this has to work.

02:23:36.817 --> 02:23:37.985
Well...

02:23:39.695 --> 02:23:42.364
Teller's testifying this morning.
That'll help.

02:23:42.448 --> 02:23:43.949
And then...

02:23:44.033 --> 02:23:45.409
Hill is in the afternoon.

02:23:45.493 --> 02:23:47.119
Hill is gonna help us too.

02:23:50.206 --> 02:23:52.833
[Strauss] As you can see, Robert,
it's not yet signed.

02:23:53.501 --> 02:23:55.169
- May I keep this?
- [Nichols] No.

02:23:57.671 --> 02:24:02.635
If you do decide to appeal,
then they'll have to send you a copy.

02:24:06.055 --> 02:24:08.140
Take my car and driver. I insist.

02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:14.980
I'll have to consult my lawyers, Lewis.

02:24:15.064 --> 02:24:17.775
Of course. But don't take too long.

02:24:17.858 --> 02:24:19.902
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

02:24:26.158 --> 02:24:28.369
I'm sorry it's come to this, Robert.

02:24:28.452 --> 02:24:29.912
I think it's wrong.

02:24:42.967 --> 02:24:46.428
[Oppenheimer] Nichols wants me to fight
so he can get it all on the record.

02:24:46.512 --> 02:24:48.264
Strauss wants me to walk away.

02:24:48.347 --> 02:24:53.018
Strauss knows that you can't do that.
You'd be accepting the charges.

02:24:53.686 --> 02:24:55.229
You'll lose your job.

02:24:55.312 --> 02:24:58.232
You will lose your reputation.
We'll lose our house.

02:24:58.315 --> 02:24:59.984
Robert, we have to fight.

02:25:03.070 --> 02:25:05.155
As AEC counsel,
I can't represent you.

02:25:05.239 --> 02:25:06.782
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

02:25:07.366 --> 02:25:09.577
- He's good.
- The best, but...

02:25:10.578 --> 02:25:11.704
I have to warn you...

02:25:13.372 --> 02:25:15.416
this won't be a fair fight.

02:25:15.499 --> 02:25:18.043
During your interview
with Boris Pash in 1943,

02:25:18.127 --> 02:25:19.753
did you refer to microfilm?

02:25:19.837 --> 02:25:23.007
- No.
- Tab 11, page one, paragraph three.

02:25:23.090 --> 02:25:24.526
You never said, "Man of the consulate

02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:26.510
expert in the use of microfilm."

02:25:26.594 --> 02:25:27.696
- [Garrison] I'm sorry.
- No.

02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:29.948
I would like to know what document
Mr. Robb is quoting from

02:25:29.972 --> 02:25:31.932
and if we might be furnished with a copy.

02:25:32.016 --> 02:25:33.809
The document is classified, Mr. Garrison.

02:25:33.893 --> 02:25:36.061
I think we should get back
to firsthand information.

02:25:36.145 --> 02:25:38.814
- This is firsthand.
- How so, Roger?

02:25:40.774 --> 02:25:42.334
There was a recording of the interview.

02:25:46.947 --> 02:25:49.867
[Garrison] You let my client sit here
and potentially perjure himself

02:25:49.950 --> 02:25:52.411
and all this time, you had a recording?

02:25:52.494 --> 02:25:55.122
Nobody told your client
to misrepresent his former answers.

02:25:55.205 --> 02:25:57.333
Misrepres...
It was 12 years ago.

02:25:57.416 --> 02:25:58.667
Can we hear this recording?

02:25:58.751 --> 02:26:00.228
You don't have the clearance,
Mr. Garrison.

02:26:00.252 --> 02:26:03.255
- But you're reading it into the record.
- Please, please.

02:26:03.339 --> 02:26:07.176
Is this proceeding interested
in entrapment or in truth?

02:26:07.259 --> 02:26:11.096
If it's truth, where's the disclosure?
Where's the witness list?

02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:13.891
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a trial,
as you're well aware.

02:26:13.974 --> 02:26:18.145
Evidentiary rules do not apply.
We are dealing with national security.

02:26:18.228 --> 02:26:19.468
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

02:26:19.521 --> 02:26:22.900
I fail to see how national security
prevents the prosecution

02:26:22.983 --> 02:26:25.962
- from providing us a list of witnesses.
- Perhaps we are in need of a brief recess.

02:26:25.986 --> 02:26:28.030
[Oppenheimer]
Gentlemen, you have my words.

02:26:28.113 --> 02:26:30.950
If you say they're from a transcript,
then I'll accept it.

02:26:31.033 --> 02:26:33.744
I've already explained
I made up a cock-and-bull story.

02:26:33.827 --> 02:26:36.914
But why would anyone
make up such an elaborate story?

02:26:36.997 --> 02:26:38.457
Because I was an idiot.

02:26:39.166 --> 02:26:40.793
Why lie?

02:26:40.876 --> 02:26:44.797
Well, clearly with the intention
of not revealing who the intermediary was.

02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:47.424
Your friend, Haakon Chevalier,
the communist?

02:26:47.508 --> 02:26:48.759
Is he still your friend?

02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:50.803
Yes.

02:26:54.056 --> 02:26:56.183
[Garrison] Dr. Rabi, thank you for coming.

02:26:56.266 --> 02:26:58.119
Do you know who else
the prosecution has called?

02:26:58.143 --> 02:27:00.354
Teller, obviously.

02:27:01.355 --> 02:27:03.691
- They've asked Lawrence.
- What did he say?

02:27:03.774 --> 02:27:07.069
- He wasn't going to help them, but...
- But?

02:27:07.653 --> 02:27:12.116
Strauss told him that you and Ruth Tolman
have been having an affair for years.

02:27:12.199 --> 02:27:14.576
The whole time you lived with them
in Pasadena.

02:27:14.660 --> 02:27:18.038
He convinced Lawrence
that Richard died of a broken heart.

02:27:18.122 --> 02:27:19.957
- That's absurd.
- What part?

02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:21.834
The broken heart.

02:27:21.917 --> 02:27:22.960
Richard never found out.

02:27:24.336 --> 02:27:25.671
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

02:27:25.754 --> 02:27:26.880
I don't know.

02:27:27.798 --> 02:27:32.511
[Garrison] Dr. Rabi, what governmental
positions do you currently hold?

02:27:32.594 --> 02:27:36.473
I am the chairman of
the General Advisory Committee to the AEC,

02:27:36.557 --> 02:27:38.350
succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

02:27:38.434 --> 02:27:40.561
And how long have you known
Dr. Oppenheimer?

02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:43.522
Since 1928. I...

02:27:43.605 --> 02:27:45.107
I know him quite well.

02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:49.737
Well enough to speak to the bearing
of his loyalty and character?

02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:53.240
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man
of upstanding character.

02:27:53.866 --> 02:27:57.619
And he is loyal to the United States,
to his friends,

02:27:57.703 --> 02:27:59.955
to the institutions of which he is part.

02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:03.042
Eat.

02:28:05.919 --> 02:28:07.921
- [door opens]
- [footsteps approaching]

02:28:22.061 --> 02:28:24.313
- [Oppenheimer] What was that?
- Nothing to worry about.

02:28:27.566 --> 02:28:29.485
[Robb] After the Russian A-bomb test,

02:28:29.568 --> 02:28:32.196
did Dr. Lawrence come to see you
about the hydrogen bomb?

02:28:32.279 --> 02:28:33.864
You'd be better off asking him.

02:28:33.947 --> 02:28:35.491
Well, I fully intend to.

02:28:36.325 --> 02:28:40.245
Would you say that Dr. Oppenheimer
was unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?

02:28:40.329 --> 02:28:43.332
No, he thought that a fusion program

02:28:43.415 --> 02:28:46.168
would come at the expense
of our awfully good fission program.

02:28:46.251 --> 02:28:50.172
- But that proved not to be the case.
- In the event, both could be done.

02:28:50.255 --> 02:28:52.925
Suppose that this board
did not feel satisfied that,

02:28:53.008 --> 02:28:57.012
in his testimony here,
Dr. Oppenheimer had been wholly truthful.

02:28:57.096 --> 02:28:59.240
What would you say whether or not
he should be cleared?

02:28:59.264 --> 02:29:01.558
Why go through all this against a man

02:29:01.642 --> 02:29:03.685
who has accomplished
what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

02:29:03.769 --> 02:29:05.312
Look at his record.

02:29:05.395 --> 02:29:07.648
We have an A-bomb
and a whole series of it.

02:29:07.731 --> 02:29:09.566
We have a whole series of Super bombs.

02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:12.194
What more do you want? Mermaids?

02:29:12.736 --> 02:29:16.323
[Teller] But I've known Secretary Strauss
for many years,

02:29:16.406 --> 02:29:19.868
and I feel it a necessity
to express the warm support

02:29:19.952 --> 02:29:22.371
for science and scientists
Lewis has shown.

02:29:22.454 --> 02:29:25.332
We'll break now,
unless there's any immediate business.

02:29:25.415 --> 02:29:28.210
[Strauss]
Senator, I'd like to once again request

02:29:28.293 --> 02:29:31.004
that we're furnished
with a list of witnesses.

02:29:31.088 --> 02:29:32.798
And I will remind the nominee

02:29:32.881 --> 02:29:35.509
that we don't always have
that information in advance.

02:29:35.592 --> 02:29:38.679
We do know that Dr. Hill
will be here after lunch.

02:29:38.762 --> 02:29:41.515
Mr. Chairman,
our next scheduled witness, Dr. Lawrence,

02:29:41.598 --> 02:29:44.393
has apparently come down with colitis.

02:29:47.729 --> 02:29:50.107
So we'll proceed
with William Borden instead.

02:29:51.066 --> 02:29:53.819
Mr. Borden, welcome. Please take a seat.

02:29:55.154 --> 02:29:59.867
Mr. Borden, during your investigation
into Dr. Oppenheimer,

02:29:59.950 --> 02:30:02.911
- did you reach certain conclusions?
- 1 did.

02:30:02.995 --> 02:30:05.581
And did there come a time
when you expressed those conclusions

02:30:05.664 --> 02:30:09.084
in a letter to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

02:30:09.168 --> 02:30:11.461
- That is correct.
- Prior to the writing of the letter,

02:30:11.545 --> 02:30:13.898
did you discuss the writing of the letter
with anybody attached

02:30:13.922 --> 02:30:15.591
to the Atomic Energy Commission?

02:30:15.674 --> 02:30:17.843
- 1 did not.
- [Robb] Do you have a copy of the letter?

02:30:17.926 --> 02:30:18.969
I have one in front of me.

02:30:19.052 --> 02:30:21.346
Would you please be so kind
as to read it, sir?

02:30:22.014 --> 02:30:24.850
"Dear Mr. Hoover,
the purpose of this letter is to state"...

02:30:24.933 --> 02:30:27.728
[Garrison]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, if I could have a...

02:30:27.811 --> 02:30:31.064
What is the purpose of the delay?
He's simply gonna read the letter.

02:30:31.148 --> 02:30:34.401
[chuckles] Mr. Chairman, this is
the first I've seen of this letter,

02:30:34.484 --> 02:30:37.446
and I see statements here, at least one,

02:30:37.529 --> 02:30:40.091
of a kind that I don't think anyone
would like to see go into the record.

02:30:40.115 --> 02:30:42.743
These are accusations
that have not previously been made.

02:30:42.826 --> 02:30:44.721
That are not part of the indictment
from Nichols.

02:30:44.745 --> 02:30:47.080
Accusations of a kind
that I don't think belong here.

02:30:47.164 --> 02:30:49.249
The witness wrote this letter
on his own initiative,

02:30:49.333 --> 02:30:51.653
laying out evidence
that has already been before the board.

02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:53.378
His conclusions are valid testimony,

02:30:53.462 --> 02:30:56.715
just like the positive conclusions
of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

02:30:56.798 --> 02:30:58.342
It cuts both ways.

02:30:58.425 --> 02:31:00.585
How long has counsel
been in possession of this letter?

02:31:00.636 --> 02:31:04.556
I don't think I should be subject
to cross-examination by you, Mr. Garrison.

02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:07.726
[Gray] Mr. Garrison, given that we
on the board have all read the letter,

02:31:07.809 --> 02:31:10.145
wouldn't it be better
to have it in the record?

02:31:10.229 --> 02:31:11.772
Let's proceed.

02:31:13.690 --> 02:31:15.317
[Borden] "Dear Mr. Hoover,

02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:18.445
the purpose of this letter
is to state my opinion

02:31:18.528 --> 02:31:22.699
based upon years of study
of the available classified evidence,

02:31:22.783 --> 02:31:24.785
that more probably than not

02:31:24.868 --> 02:31:29.706
J. Robert Oppenheimer
is an agent of the Soviet Union.

02:31:29.790 --> 02:31:32.209
The following conclusions are justified.

02:31:32.292 --> 02:31:36.630
One, between 1929 and 1942,
more probably than not,

02:31:36.713 --> 02:31:40.550
J. Robert Oppenheimer
was a sufficiently hardened communist,

02:31:40.634 --> 02:31:43.011
that he volunteered information
to the Soviets.

02:31:43.095 --> 02:31:45.430
Two, more probably than not,

02:31:45.514 --> 02:31:49.142
he has since been functioning
as an espionage agent.

02:31:49.810 --> 02:31:52.312
Three, more probably than not,

02:31:52.396 --> 02:31:54.982
he has since acted
under a Soviet directive

02:31:55.065 --> 02:31:57.859
in influencing
United States military policy"...

02:31:57.943 --> 02:32:00.195
- I'm sorry, Robert.
- "atomic energy, intelligence"...

02:32:00.279 --> 02:32:05.158
Is anyone ever going to tell the truth
about what's happening here?

02:32:05.242 --> 02:32:08.078
[chairman]
We will now hear from Dr. David Hill.

02:32:08.161 --> 02:32:09.579
[shutters clicking]

02:32:14.835 --> 02:32:15.836
[shutter clicks]

02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:21.383
Dr. Hill, would you care
to make a statement?

02:32:23.385 --> 02:32:24.386
Thank you.

02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:28.473
I've been asked to testify
about Lewis Strauss.

02:32:28.557 --> 02:32:33.812
A man who has given years of service
in high positions of government

02:32:33.895 --> 02:32:38.650
and who is known to be earnest,
hardworking and intelligent.

02:32:39.818 --> 02:32:42.321
The views I have to express are my own,

02:32:42.404 --> 02:32:45.157
but I believe that much I have to say
will help to indicate

02:32:45.240 --> 02:32:48.702
why most of the scientists in this country

02:32:48.785 --> 02:32:53.582
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss
completely out of government.

02:32:53.665 --> 02:32:55.667
[gallery murmuring]

02:32:55.751 --> 02:32:59.671
You're referring to the hostility
of certain scientists

02:32:59.755 --> 02:33:03.467
directed toward Mr. Strauss
because of his commitment to security,

02:33:03.550 --> 02:33:06.261
as demonstrated in the Oppenheimer affair?

02:33:08.722 --> 02:33:09.723
No.

02:33:10.515 --> 02:33:15.062
Because of the personal vindictiveness
he demonstrated against Dr. Oppenheimer.

02:33:15.145 --> 02:33:16.730
[murmuring intensifies]

02:33:16.813 --> 02:33:18.690
- [chairman] Order.
- [gavel rapping]

02:33:18.774 --> 02:33:20.025
Order.

02:33:20.609 --> 02:33:24.112
It appears to most scientists
around this country

02:33:25.405 --> 02:33:28.241
that Robert Oppenheimer
is now being pilloried

02:33:28.325 --> 02:33:32.746
and put through an ordeal
because he expressed his honest opinions.

02:33:32.829 --> 02:33:36.041
Dr. Bush, I thought I was performing
a service to my country

02:33:36.124 --> 02:33:37.250
when hearing this case.

02:33:37.334 --> 02:33:41.838
No board in this country
should sit in judgment of a man

02:33:41.922 --> 02:33:44.007
because he expressed strong opinions.

02:33:44.091 --> 02:33:46.760
If you wanna try that case,
you should try me.

02:33:47.260 --> 02:33:50.472
Excuse me, gentlemen, if I become stirred.

02:33:51.348 --> 02:33:52.349
But I am.

02:33:52.933 --> 02:33:56.812
Dr. Hill, we've already heard that
Mr. Strauss did not bring the charges,

02:33:56.895 --> 02:33:59.856
or participate in the hearings
against Dr. Oppenheimer.

02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:04.611
The Oppenheimer matter
was initiated and carried through

02:34:04.694 --> 02:34:07.155
largely through the animus
of Lewis Strauss.

02:34:07.239 --> 02:34:08.615
[gallery murmuring]

02:34:08.698 --> 02:34:11.576
Oppenheimer made mincemeat
out of Strauss's position

02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:13.703
on the shipment of isotopes to Norway,

02:34:13.787 --> 02:34:17.290
and Strauss never forgave him
this public humiliation.

02:34:17.958 --> 02:34:21.211
Another controversy between them centered
around their differences in judgment

02:34:21.294 --> 02:34:24.381
on how the H-bomb
would contribute to national security.

02:34:24.464 --> 02:34:26.925
Strauss turned
to the personnel security system

02:34:27.008 --> 02:34:30.595
in order to destroy
Oppenheimer's effectiveness.

02:34:30.679 --> 02:34:33.557
And Strauss was able
to find a few ambitious men

02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:36.393
who also disagreed
with Oppenheimer's positions

02:34:36.476 --> 02:34:39.855
and envied him
his prestige in government circles.

02:34:39.938 --> 02:34:44.025
I've always assumed, and still assume,
that he's loyal to the United States.

02:34:44.651 --> 02:34:45.652
I believe this.

02:34:45.735 --> 02:34:49.156
And I shall believe it until I see
very conclusive proof to the opposite.

02:34:49.239 --> 02:34:52.951
Do you, or do you not, believe that
Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:58.123
In a great number of cases,

02:34:58.206 --> 02:35:01.543
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer
act in a way which was, to me,

02:35:01.626 --> 02:35:03.545
exceedingly hard to understand.

02:35:03.628 --> 02:35:06.214
I thoroughly disagreed with him
in numerous issues,

02:35:06.298 --> 02:35:09.718
and his actions, frankly,
appeared to me confused and complicated.

02:35:09.801 --> 02:35:11.511
To this extent, I feel,

02:35:11.595 --> 02:35:14.556
I want to see the vital interests
of this country

02:35:14.639 --> 02:35:16.725
in hands which I understand better,

02:35:16.808 --> 02:35:18.643
and therefore trust more.

02:35:19.478 --> 02:35:21.229
- Thank you, Doctor.
- [Robb] Thank you.

02:35:24.983 --> 02:35:26.067
I'm sorry.

02:35:28.862 --> 02:35:31.114
[Kitty] You shook his fucking hand?

02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:33.992
Oh, I would have spit in his face.

02:35:34.075 --> 02:35:35.994
Not sure the board
would have appreciated that.

02:35:36.077 --> 02:35:37.954
Is it not gentlemanly enough for you?

02:35:38.038 --> 02:35:40.624
I think you're all being
too goddamn gentlemanly.

02:35:40.707 --> 02:35:42.626
Gray must see what Robb is doing.

02:35:42.709 --> 02:35:44.544
Why doesn't he just shut him down?

02:35:44.628 --> 02:35:47.214
And you shaking Teller's hand.

02:35:47.297 --> 02:35:50.342
You need to stop playing the martyr.

02:35:51.134 --> 02:35:56.097
Under the current AEC guidelines,
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

02:36:02.103 --> 02:36:06.650
Under my interpretation
of the Atomic Energy Act,

02:36:06.733 --> 02:36:11.321
which did not exist
when I hired Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942,

02:36:12.614 --> 02:36:18.119
I would not clear him today
if I were on the commission.

02:36:18.203 --> 02:36:19.805
[Robb]
Good, thank you, General, that is all.

02:36:19.829 --> 02:36:22.332
But I don't think
I'd clear any of those guys.

02:36:22.415 --> 02:36:23.416
That's all.

02:36:26.503 --> 02:36:28.630
[Garrison]
Dr. Oppenheimer had no responsibility

02:36:28.713 --> 02:36:31.216
in the selection or the clearance
of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

02:36:31.299 --> 02:36:32.551
No. None at all.

02:36:32.634 --> 02:36:35.804
And you wouldn't want to leave this board
with any suggestion today

02:36:35.887 --> 02:36:39.015
that you're here questioning
his basic loyalty to the United States

02:36:39.099 --> 02:36:40.600
and the operation of Los Alamos.

02:36:40.684 --> 02:36:42.018
By no means.

02:36:42.102 --> 02:36:45.021
I hope I didn't lead anyone
to believe otherwise for an instant.

02:36:46.314 --> 02:36:47.524
[Gray] Thank you, General.

02:36:56.908 --> 02:36:58.618
[door opens]

02:37:05.041 --> 02:37:07.168
Okay. We shouldn't keep them waiting.

02:37:07.252 --> 02:37:08.253
She'll be here.

02:37:08.753 --> 02:37:10.046
Do you even want her here?

02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:12.549
Only a fool or an adolescent

02:37:12.632 --> 02:37:14.676
presumes to know
someone else's relationship,

02:37:14.759 --> 02:37:16.678
and you're neither, Lloyd.

02:37:16.761 --> 02:37:18.346
- [door opens]
- [footsteps approaching]

02:37:19.389 --> 02:37:22.142
Kitty and I, we're grown-ups.

02:37:23.226 --> 02:37:25.312
We've walked through fire together.

02:37:25.895 --> 02:37:27.147
She'll do fine.

02:37:28.064 --> 02:37:32.235
[Garrison] Would you describe your views
on communism as pro, anti, neutral?

02:37:32.319 --> 02:37:33.462
[Kitty] Very strongly against.

02:37:33.486 --> 02:37:38.033
I've had nothing to do with communism
since 1936, since...

02:37:39.159 --> 02:37:40.994
since before I met Robert.

02:37:42.787 --> 02:37:43.913
That's all.

02:37:44.998 --> 02:37:46.809
[Hill]
The record demonstrates that Oppenheimer

02:37:46.833 --> 02:37:50.045
was not interrogated
by impartial and disinterested counsel

02:37:50.128 --> 02:37:51.129
for the Gray board.

02:37:51.212 --> 02:37:53.048
He was interrogated by a prosecutor

02:37:53.131 --> 02:37:55.842
who used all the tricks
of a rather ingenious legal background.

02:37:55.925 --> 02:38:00.263
You are charging now that
the Gray board permitted a prosecution.

02:38:01.014 --> 02:38:03.099
If I were on the Gray board,

02:38:03.183 --> 02:38:06.519
I would have protested against the tactics
of the man who served, in fact,

02:38:06.603 --> 02:38:08.063
as the prosecuting counsel.

02:38:08.146 --> 02:38:09.981
A man appointed, not by the board...

02:38:11.274 --> 02:38:12.567
but by Lewis Strauss.

02:38:13.443 --> 02:38:14.694
[gallery murmuring]

02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:16.320
Who was this?

02:38:17.906 --> 02:38:19.574
I'm sorry?

02:38:19.658 --> 02:38:20.825
[McGee] Who was this?

02:38:20.909 --> 02:38:22.160
Uh, Roger Robb.

02:38:22.827 --> 02:38:24.162
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

02:38:28.667 --> 02:38:30.835
Did you have
a Communist Party membership card?

02:38:32.671 --> 02:38:33.838
I'm...

02:38:33.922 --> 02:38:34.923
I'm not sure.

02:38:35.006 --> 02:38:36.216
Not sure?

02:38:38.927 --> 02:38:40.053
Well...

02:38:43.098 --> 02:38:44.099
Well?

02:38:53.358 --> 02:38:56.361
I mean, presumably,
the act of joining the Party

02:38:56.444 --> 02:38:59.656
required sending some money
and receiving a card, no?

02:39:02.617 --> 02:39:03.618
Yeah.

02:39:07.372 --> 02:39:08.915
[sighs]

02:39:09.666 --> 02:39:10.834
Sorry.

02:39:11.876 --> 02:39:13.211
[Robb] Yeah.

02:39:15.255 --> 02:39:18.591
It's just it was all so very long ago,
Mr. Robb, wasn't it?

02:39:18.675 --> 02:39:20.361
- Not really.
- Long enough to have forgotten.

02:39:20.385 --> 02:39:23.572
- Did you return the card or rip it up?
- The card whose existence I've forgotten?

02:39:23.596 --> 02:39:26.558
- Your Communist Party membership card.
- Haven't the slightest idea.

02:39:29.394 --> 02:39:33.815
Can a distinction be made between
Soviet communism and communism?

02:39:33.898 --> 02:39:37.026
In the days when I was a member,
I thought they were definitely two things.

02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:40.155
I thought that the Communist Party
of the United States

02:39:40.238 --> 02:39:42.699
was concerned with our domestic problems.

02:39:42.782 --> 02:39:43.950
I now no longer believe this.

02:39:44.033 --> 02:39:46.595
I believe the thing's linked together
and spread all over the world,

02:39:46.619 --> 02:39:50.331
and I have believed this
since I left the Party, 16 years ago.

02:39:50.415 --> 02:39:52.917
- But...
- 17 years ago. My mistake.

02:39:53.501 --> 02:39:54.919
- But you sai...
- Sorry, 18.

02:39:56.337 --> 02:39:57.630
18 years ago.

02:39:58.882 --> 02:40:01.760
Are you familiar with the fact
your husband was making contributions

02:40:01.843 --> 02:40:04.012
to the Spanish Civil War as late as 19427

02:40:04.095 --> 02:40:06.389
I knew that Robert
gave money from time to time.

02:40:06.473 --> 02:40:08.993
Did you know this money
was going into Communist Party channels?

02:40:09.017 --> 02:40:11.060
- Don't you mean "through"?
- Pardon?

02:40:11.144 --> 02:40:13.646
I think you mean "through
Communist Party channels," don't you?

02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:15.315
- Yes!
- Yes?

02:40:15.398 --> 02:40:17.442
- Yes!
- Yes.

02:40:17.525 --> 02:40:20.528
Then would it be fair to say
that this meant that by 1942,

02:40:20.612 --> 02:40:24.491
your husband had not stopped having
anything to do with the Communist Party?

02:40:24.574 --> 02:40:27.636
You don't have to answer that yes or no.
You can answer that any way you wish.

02:40:27.660 --> 02:40:29.370
I know that, thank you.

02:40:29.454 --> 02:40:31.206
It's your question.

02:40:31.289 --> 02:40:32.749
It's not properly phrased.

02:40:32.832 --> 02:40:34.560
- Do you understand what I'm getting at?
- 1 do.

02:40:34.584 --> 02:40:37.545
- Then why don't you answer it that way?
- 'Cause I don't like your phrase.

02:40:37.629 --> 02:40:39.523
"Having anything to do
with the Communist Party."

02:40:39.547 --> 02:40:42.675
Because Robert never had anything to do
with the Communist Party as such.

02:40:42.759 --> 02:40:45.094
I know he gave money to Spanish refugees.

02:40:45.178 --> 02:40:48.348
I know he took an intellectual interest
in communist ideas...

02:40:48.431 --> 02:40:50.183
Are there two types of communists?

02:40:50.266 --> 02:40:52.977
Intellectual communists
and your plain, old, regular commie?

02:40:53.061 --> 02:40:54.187
[laughs]

02:40:54.270 --> 02:40:55.897
Well, I couldn't answer that one.

02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:58.525
[Evans chuckles] I couldn't either.

02:41:05.448 --> 02:41:06.699
Good evening.

02:41:06.783 --> 02:41:08.117
Robert, you can't win this thing.

02:41:08.201 --> 02:41:10.495
It's a kangaroo court
with a predetermined outcome.

02:41:10.578 --> 02:41:14.499
- Why put yourself through more of it?
- I have my reasons.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:17.168
All right.

02:41:17.252 --> 02:41:18.461
Good night.

02:41:18.545 --> 02:41:19.796
[car door closes]

02:41:23.174 --> 02:41:24.509
He has a point.

02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:27.595
I'm not sure you understand, Albert.

02:41:27.679 --> 02:41:28.721
No?

02:41:29.305 --> 02:41:31.933
I left my country never to return.

02:41:32.892 --> 02:41:34.978
You served your country well.

02:41:35.061 --> 02:41:37.939
If this is the reward
she offers you, then...

02:41:38.898 --> 02:41:41.234
perhaps you should turn your back on her.

02:41:42.277 --> 02:41:44.320
Damn it, I happen to love this country.

02:41:45.113 --> 02:41:47.407
Then tell them to go to hell.

02:41:47.490 --> 02:41:48.950
Interestingly enough,

02:41:49.033 --> 02:41:51.452
this is no longer a confirmation hearing,

02:41:51.536 --> 02:41:54.330
it's now a trial about a trial!

02:41:56.124 --> 02:41:59.043
It's not good he's telling everyone
you initiated the hearings.

02:41:59.127 --> 02:42:01.170
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

02:42:01.254 --> 02:42:04.757
He certainly can't prove
that I gave the file to Borden.

02:42:04.841 --> 02:42:07.886
We're not in court, sir.
There's no burden of proof.

02:42:07.969 --> 02:42:09.679
Right. They're not convicting...

02:42:10.597 --> 02:42:11.598
just denying.

02:42:12.515 --> 02:42:15.435
But why would Hill come here
to tear me down? What's his angle?

02:42:15.518 --> 02:42:18.313
Do people need a reason
to do the right thing?

02:42:18.396 --> 02:42:19.314
As he sees it.

02:42:19.397 --> 02:42:22.692
I told you, Oppenheimer poisoned
the scientists against me,

02:42:22.775 --> 02:42:24.152
right from that first meeting.

02:42:24.235 --> 02:42:27.238
I don't know what Oppenheimer
said to him that day,

02:42:27.322 --> 02:42:30.199
but Einstein wouldn't even meet my eye.

02:42:30.283 --> 02:42:31.618
[no audible dialogue]

02:42:31.701 --> 02:42:34.537
[Strauss] Oppenheimer knows
how to manipulate his own.

02:42:34.621 --> 02:42:38.374
And at Los Alamos,
he preyed on the naivete of scientists

02:42:38.458 --> 02:42:40.627
who thought they'd get a say
in how we used their work.

02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:42.921
Don't ever think
he was that naive himself.

02:42:43.671 --> 02:42:45.048
[Robb] Doctor.

02:42:45.131 --> 02:42:49.928
During your work on the hydrogen bomb,
were you deterred by any moral qualms?

02:42:50.762 --> 02:42:51.971
Yes, of course.

02:42:52.055 --> 02:42:53.935
But you still got on with your work,
didn't you?

02:42:53.973 --> 02:42:58.144
Yes, because this was work of exploration.
It was not the preparation of a weapon.

02:42:58.227 --> 02:43:00.313
You mean it was more of
an academic excursion?

02:43:00.396 --> 02:43:03.399
No, it is not an academic thing
whether you can build a hydrogen bomb.

02:43:03.483 --> 02:43:04.752
It's a matter of life and death.

02:43:04.776 --> 02:43:05.985
By 1942,

02:43:06.069 --> 02:43:08.380
you were actively pushing the development
of the hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

02:43:08.404 --> 02:43:11.574
Pushing's not the right word.
Supporting it and working on it, yes.

02:43:11.658 --> 02:43:14.035
So when did these moral qualms
become so strong

02:43:14.118 --> 02:43:17.121
that you actively opposed the development
of the hydrogen bomb?

02:43:17.205 --> 02:43:19.958
When it was suggested
that it be the policy of the United States

02:43:20.041 --> 02:43:22.877
to make these things at all cost,
without regard to the balance

02:43:22.961 --> 02:43:26.464
between these weapons
and atomic weapons as part of our arsenal.

02:43:27.924 --> 02:43:30.009
What do moral qualms have to do with that?

02:43:30.718 --> 02:43:33.554
- What do moral qualms have to do with it?
- Yes.

02:43:33.638 --> 02:43:35.723
Oppenheimer wanted to own the atomic bomb.

02:43:35.807 --> 02:43:37.767
He wanted to be the man
who moved the Earth.

02:43:37.850 --> 02:43:42.313
He talks about putting
the nuclear genie back in the bottle.

02:43:42.397 --> 02:43:45.900
Well, I'm here to tell you
that I know J. Robert Oppenheimer,

02:43:45.984 --> 02:43:49.195
and if he could do it all over,
he'd do it all the same.

02:43:49.278 --> 02:43:52.991
You know he's never once said
that he regrets Hiroshima?

02:43:53.074 --> 02:43:55.827
He'd do it all over. Why?

02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:59.706
Because it made him
the most important man who ever lived.

02:43:59.789 --> 02:44:03.543
[stammering]
Well, we've freely used the atomic bomb...

02:44:03.626 --> 02:44:05.729
[Robb] In fact, Doctor,
you assisted in selecting the target

02:44:05.753 --> 02:44:07.922
to drop the atomic bomb on Japan,
didn't you?

02:44:08.006 --> 02:44:09.882
- Yes.
- [Robb] Then you knew, did you not,

02:44:09.966 --> 02:44:12.277
that by dropping that atomic bomb
on the target you selected,

02:44:12.301 --> 02:44:15.221
that thousands of civilians would be
killed or injured, is that correct?

02:44:15.304 --> 02:44:17.473
- Yes, not as many as turned out...
- [feet stamping]

02:44:17.557 --> 02:44:20.059
Oh. Well, how many
were killed or injured?

02:44:20.143 --> 02:44:21.227
70,000.

02:44:21.310 --> 02:44:22.687
70,000 at both Hiroshima and...

02:44:22.770 --> 02:44:24.522
110,000 at both.

02:44:24.605 --> 02:44:26.190
[Robb] On the day of each bombing?

02:44:27.734 --> 02:44:29.986
- Yes.
- And in the weeks and years that followed?

02:44:30.069 --> 02:44:33.322
It has been put at somewhere
between 50,000 and 100,000.

02:44:33.406 --> 02:44:35.491
- 220,000 dead, at least.
- [Oppenheimer] Yes.

02:44:35.575 --> 02:44:37.118
Any moral scruples about that?

02:44:39.037 --> 02:44:40.038
Terrible ones.

02:44:40.121 --> 02:44:43.916
Yet you testified in here that the bombing
of Hiroshima was very successful.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:47.045
- Technically successful.
- Oh! Technically, it was very successful.

02:44:47.128 --> 02:44:49.505
And it is also alleged
to have helped end the war.

02:44:49.589 --> 02:44:52.709
Would you have been supportive of the
dropping of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

02:44:52.759 --> 02:44:55.136
- That would make no sense at all.
- Why?

02:44:55.219 --> 02:44:57.055
[stammering] The target is too small.

02:44:57.138 --> 02:44:59.640
Well, supposing there had been
a target in Japan big enough

02:44:59.724 --> 02:45:01.100
for a thermonuclear weapon,

02:45:01.184 --> 02:45:02.786
would you have been opposed
to the dropping of it?

02:45:02.810 --> 02:45:04.580
This was not a problem
with which I was confronted...

02:45:04.604 --> 02:45:06.084
I'm confronting you with it now, sir.

02:45:06.147 --> 02:45:07.815
It was all part of his plan.

02:45:07.899 --> 02:45:11.736
He wanted the glorious, insincere guilt
of the self-important

02:45:11.819 --> 02:45:13.780
to wear like a fucking crown.

02:45:13.863 --> 02:45:19.368
Say, "No, we cannot go down this road,"
even as he knew we'd have to.

02:45:19.452 --> 02:45:21.132
Would you have been opposed
to the dropping

02:45:21.204 --> 02:45:23.599
of a thermonuclear weapon on Japan
because of moral scruples?

02:45:23.623 --> 02:45:25.059
- Yes, I believe I would, sir.
- [feet stamping]

02:45:25.083 --> 02:45:26.143
Did you oppose the dropping

02:45:26.167 --> 02:45:28.878
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima
because of moral scruples?

02:45:28.961 --> 02:45:30.880
- We set forth our arg...
- No, you.

02:45:30.963 --> 02:45:32.673
- I'm asking you. You!
- I set...

02:45:32.757 --> 02:45:35.051
I set forth our arguments
against dropping it,

02:45:35.134 --> 02:45:36.904
- but I did not endorse them.
- [stamping intensifies]

02:45:36.928 --> 02:45:40.056
You mean after working night and day
for three years building the bomb,

02:45:40.139 --> 02:45:42.100
you then argued against the use of it.
[laughs]

02:45:42.183 --> 02:45:45.895
I was asked by the secretary of war
what the views of scientists were.

02:45:45.978 --> 02:45:48.189
I gave him the views against
and the views for.

02:45:48.272 --> 02:45:50.691
You supported the dropping
of the atom bomb on Japan.

02:45:50.775 --> 02:45:53.277
- What do you mean, "support"?
- [Robb] You supported it.

02:45:53.361 --> 02:45:55.822
- You helped pick the target, didn't you?
- I did my job.

02:45:55.905 --> 02:45:58.282
I was not in a policy-making position
at Los Alamos.

02:45:58.366 --> 02:46:00.326
I would have done anything
I was asked to do.

02:46:00.409 --> 02:46:02.829
Then you would have built
the H-bomb too, wouldn't you?

02:46:02.912 --> 02:46:04.956
- 1 couldn't.
- 1 didn't ask you that, Doctor.

02:46:05.039 --> 02:46:06.374
And the GAC report,

02:46:06.457 --> 02:46:09.043
which you co-authored
after the Soviet atomic test,

02:46:09.127 --> 02:46:12.588
- said a Super bomb should never be built.
- [stamping intensifies]

02:46:12.672 --> 02:46:14.108
What we meant... What I meant was...

02:46:14.132 --> 02:46:15.967
- What you? Who? Who?
- What I meant...

02:46:17.885 --> 02:46:20.763
And wouldn't the Russians
do anything to increase their strength?

02:46:20.847 --> 02:46:23.391
- [stamping stops]
- If we did it, they would have to do it.

02:46:23.474 --> 02:46:27.728
Our efforts would only fuel their efforts,
just as it had with the atomic bomb.

02:46:27.812 --> 02:46:30.815
"Just as it had with the atomic bomb,"
exactly!

02:46:31.524 --> 02:46:35.778
No moral scruples in 1945, plenty in 1949.

02:46:40.074 --> 02:46:41.242
[Gray] Dr. Oppenheimer...

02:46:43.452 --> 02:46:46.205
when did
your strong moral convictions develop

02:46:46.289 --> 02:46:48.082
with respect to the hydrogen bomb?

02:46:55.923 --> 02:46:57.758
When it became clear to me...

02:46:59.218 --> 02:47:02.263
that we would tend
to use any weapon we had.

02:47:05.308 --> 02:47:07.518
[Strauss]
J. Robert Oppenheimer the Martyr.

02:47:07.602 --> 02:47:10.146
I gave him exactly what he wanted.

02:47:10.730 --> 02:47:14.358
To be remembered for Trinity,
not Hiroshima.

02:47:15.109 --> 02:47:17.236
Not Nagasaki.

02:47:20.198 --> 02:47:21.949
He should be thanking me.

02:47:22.992 --> 02:47:24.285
Well, he's not.

02:47:27.705 --> 02:47:29.123
Do we still have enough votes,

02:47:29.207 --> 02:47:31.125
or is the crowning moment of my career

02:47:31.209 --> 02:47:34.295
about to become
the most public humiliation of my life?

02:47:35.213 --> 02:47:38.841
Full Senate's about to vote.
You'll scrape through.

02:47:38.925 --> 02:47:40.509
Great, then gather the fucking press.

02:47:41.093 --> 02:47:42.470
[Gray] Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

02:47:42.553 --> 02:47:45.556
This board,
having heard testimony from you

02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:48.851
and many of your current
and former colleagues,

02:47:48.935 --> 02:47:53.022
has come to the unanimous conclusion
that you are a loyal citizen.

02:47:55.274 --> 02:48:00.488
However, in the light
of your continuing associations

02:48:00.571 --> 02:48:04.033
and disregard for the security apparatus
of this country,

02:48:04.116 --> 02:48:07.578
together with your somewhat
disturbing conduct

02:48:07.662 --> 02:48:09.580
on the hydrogen bomb program,

02:48:09.664 --> 02:48:11.332
and the regrettable lack of candor

02:48:11.415 --> 02:48:14.293
in certain of your responses
to this board,

02:48:14.377 --> 02:48:17.213
we have voted two-to-one

02:48:17.296 --> 02:48:20.341
to deny the renewal
of your security clearance.

02:48:20.424 --> 02:48:23.386
A full written opinion,
with a dissent from Mr. Evans,

02:48:23.469 --> 02:48:26.639
will be issued to the AEC
in the coming days.

02:48:26.722 --> 02:48:27.932
That is all.

02:48:32.353 --> 02:48:33.854
Gordon.

02:48:33.938 --> 02:48:35.481
[indistinct]

02:48:38.651 --> 02:48:40.152
[Kitty on phone] Robert.

02:48:40.987 --> 02:48:42.029
Robert.

02:48:45.157 --> 02:48:46.450
Don't, uh...

02:48:49.287 --> 02:48:50.788
Don't take in the sheets.

02:48:52.415 --> 02:48:54.333
[reporters clamoring]

02:48:56.210 --> 02:48:58.313
- [reporter] Sir.
- [Senate aide] Two minutes. Two minutes.

02:48:58.337 --> 02:49:00.172
You'll get your shot.

02:49:00.881 --> 02:49:02.466
[clamoring continues]

02:49:03.884 --> 02:49:05.052
[Strauss] Is it official?

02:49:07.346 --> 02:49:11.058
[Senate aide] Well, there were a couple
of unexpected holdouts.

02:49:16.314 --> 02:49:18.357
I'm denied. Yeah?

02:49:19.150 --> 02:49:20.818
- I'm afraid so, sir.
- All right.

02:49:28.492 --> 02:49:29.660
Who were the holdouts?

02:49:29.744 --> 02:49:32.538
Um... There were three,

02:49:32.621 --> 02:49:35.041
led by the junior senator
from Massachusetts.

02:49:35.124 --> 02:49:37.251
Young guy trying to make
a name for himself,

02:49:37.335 --> 02:49:39.587
didn't like what you did to Oppenheimer.

02:49:39.670 --> 02:49:40.671
What's his name?

02:49:41.589 --> 02:49:44.675
Uh, Kennedy. John F. Kennedy.

02:49:48.512 --> 02:49:49.680
Kitty?

02:49:55.936 --> 02:49:59.315
Did you think that if you let them
tar and feather you,

02:49:59.398 --> 02:50:01.525
that the world would forgive you?

02:50:05.404 --> 02:50:06.906
It won't.

02:50:09.241 --> 02:50:10.451
We'll see.

02:50:20.503 --> 02:50:21.962
Goddamn it.

02:50:23.839 --> 02:50:24.882
[muttering]

02:50:24.965 --> 02:50:26.884
You told me I'd be okay.

02:50:26.967 --> 02:50:29.261
Yeah, well,
I didn't have all the facts, did I?

02:50:29.345 --> 02:50:30.388
Here's a fact.

02:50:30.471 --> 02:50:32.640
President Eisenhower
pinned the Medal of Freedom

02:50:32.723 --> 02:50:34.141
on my chest last year,

02:50:34.225 --> 02:50:36.685
'cause I've always done
what's right for this country.

02:50:36.769 --> 02:50:39.063
They don't want me in the Cabinet room?

02:50:39.146 --> 02:50:41.607
Oh, that's... That's fine.

02:50:41.690 --> 02:50:43.984
Maybe they should just invite
Oppenheimer instead.

02:50:44.068 --> 02:50:45.986
Maybe they will.

02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:49.990
I told you, he turned the scientists
against me one by one,

02:50:50.074 --> 02:50:51.242
starting with Einstein.

02:50:51.325 --> 02:50:53.702
I told you about Einstein.
I saw him by the pond.

02:50:53.786 --> 02:50:55.121
You did, but you know, sir,

02:50:55.204 --> 02:50:59.083
since nobody really knows
what they said to each other that day,

02:50:59.166 --> 02:51:02.711
is it possible
they didn't talk about you at all?

02:51:02.795 --> 02:51:05.047
Is it possible they
spoke about something...

02:51:06.215 --> 02:51:07.633
more important?

02:51:07.716 --> 02:51:09.593
- [reporter] Mr. Strauss!
- [all clamoring]

02:51:09.677 --> 02:51:11.220
[camera shutters clicking]

02:51:18.477 --> 02:51:20.187
Oh! [chuckles]

02:51:22.565 --> 02:51:23.732
Thank you. [chuckles]

02:51:23.816 --> 02:51:25.192
Albert.

02:51:26.444 --> 02:51:28.404
- Ah...
- [clears throat]

02:51:28.487 --> 02:51:30.030
The man of the moment.

02:51:34.118 --> 02:51:37.371
You once held a reception for me.

02:51:37.455 --> 02:51:40.875
- In Berkeley. You gave me an award, mmm?
- Yes.

02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:45.171
You all thought
that I had lost the ability to understand

02:51:45.254 --> 02:51:47.089
what I'd started.

02:51:47.173 --> 02:51:50.718
So, the award really wasn't for me.

02:51:50.801 --> 02:51:53.137
It was for all of you, hmm?

02:51:54.889 --> 02:51:56.265
Now it's your turn

02:51:57.099 --> 02:52:01.520
to deal with the consequences
of your achievement.

02:52:02.688 --> 02:52:04.231
And one day,

02:52:04.315 --> 02:52:06.317
when they've punished you enough...

02:52:08.277 --> 02:52:11.822
they'll serve you salmon and potato salad.

02:52:16.285 --> 02:52:17.453
Make speeches...

02:52:17.536 --> 02:52:19.205
[no audible dialogue]

02:52:19.288 --> 02:52:20.748
give you a medal.

02:52:22.750 --> 02:52:24.168
Hello, Frank.

02:52:24.251 --> 02:52:25.586
You're happy, I'm happy.

02:52:32.843 --> 02:52:35.513
[Einstein] Pat you on the back,
tell you all is forgiven.

02:52:37.389 --> 02:52:38.390
Just remember...

02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:42.102
it won't be for you.

02:52:47.316 --> 02:52:48.651
It be for therm.

02:53:02.164 --> 02:53:03.457
Albert.

02:53:05.209 --> 02:53:08.587
When I came to you
with those calculations,

02:53:08.671 --> 02:53:12.383
we thought we might start
a chain reaction that would

02:53:12.466 --> 02:53:14.301
destroy the entire world?

02:53:15.219 --> 02:53:18.764
Mmm. I remember it well.
What of it?

02:53:22.726 --> 02:53:24.270
I believe we did.

02:53:27.439 --> 02:53:28.816
[feet stamping]

02:53:36.949 --> 02:53:38.867
[stamping continues]
