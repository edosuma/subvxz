but, then... I'm screwed.

20:19.574 --> 20:21.074
You're gonna hate me forever.

20:21.076 --> 20:23.810
Yeah, we want you to feel
that way 'cause you've been

20:23.812 --> 20:26.379
working your ass off all day
to make things right.

20:26.381 --> 20:28.581
It turns out the only thing
that makes you a good dad

20:28.583 --> 20:31.317
- is being a guilty dad.
- Yeah.

20:31.319 --> 20:33.519
And that's the true meaning
of Father's Day.

20:33.537 --> 20:36.538
- No!!
- That's just a character flaw!

20:36.540 --> 20:39.941
Noticing my flaws
and my strengths.

20:39.943 --> 20:42.210
Is... that the true meaning
of Father's Day?

20:42.212 --> 20:44.546
Dad, I'll explain it all in
the back of that guy's pickup.

20:44.548 --> 20:46.981
Or better yet ...
why don't you drive?

20:46.983 --> 20:48.483
<i>You know what, guys?</i>

20:48.485 --> 20:51.386
<i>This is easily one
of my favorite Father's Days.</i>

20:51.388 --> 20:52.720
<i>And Christmases.</i>

20:52.722 --> 20:55.123
<i>Did you guys know
it was Christmas?</i>

20:55.125 --> 20:57.091
