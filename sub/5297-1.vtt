04:42.660 --> 04:43.980
Dewey. Elise.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.940
Sorry to break up charm school.

04:46.940 --> 04:49.180
What the hell is that beast still
doing on the D16?

04:50.140 --> 04:51.780
I told you I need that track clear.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.660
Relax, Manny, w're just about to move that.

04:54.700 --> 04:55.700
Like hell you are, my ass.

04:56.180 --> 05:00.700
We have 150 schools students coming on a
field trip on D16, I need that track clear.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.180
D-10's clear, you can set it there.

05:06.860 --> 05:08.300
Okay, you know your lines.

05:10.380 --> 05:13.260
Welcome to the Railroad safety campaign.

05:13.380 --> 05:16.620
We're a program made to educate people like
yourself

05:16.740 --> 05:18.740
about railway safety.

05:18.780 --> 05:19.820
Hey, settle down.

05:20.460 --> 05:21.380
Let's have a show of hands.

05:21.820 --> 05:23.180
Who has ridden a train before?

05:24.900 --> 05:27.220
All right.
All aboard.

05:31.420 --> 05:32.780
So, what's our day?

05:33.820 --> 05:35.340
They got us going on light power

05:35.460 --> 05:40.060
Supposed to pick up 25 cars just passed
Stanton and straight shot to Wilkinson.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.300
Any slow orders?

05:41.780 --> 05:42.740
No.

05:42.860 --> 05:43.820
Are you sure?

05:44.660 --> 05:46.220
Maybe hot I didn't red?

05:47.260 --> 05:49.260
No. No slow orders.

05:50.540 --> 05:51.620
All right.

05:57.340 --> 05:59.060
Dewey, what the hell's
taking you so long?

05:59.540 --> 06:04.300
It's 39 cars, the thing's a half a mile
long, for Christ's sake.

06:08.380 --> 06:10.020
Elise, channel up.

06:11.180 --> 06:12.300
Starts, Dewey.

06:12.780 --> 06:13.580
Do you believe this shit?

06:16.740 --> 06:19.220
Hey, hold up, you forgot to tie in the
air at this point.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.660
Yeah, so?

06:20.940 --> 06:22.900
So, you don't have any air brakes.

06:22.980 --> 06:26.340
Tie the hose once we park
for Inspection.

06:26.540 --> 06:27.580
OK.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.140
I only got one rule.

06:40.620 --> 06:41.700
One rule only.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.140
If you're gonna do something, do it right.

06:43.220 --> 06:45.140
If you do not know how to do it,
you ask me. All right?

06:46.020 --> 06:47.540
Likewise, if you need anything from me
speak up

06:47.580 --> 06:49.940
because ... you're the conductor.

06:50.060 --> 06:51.780
Once we get our freight,
it's your train.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.420
I'm just the guy driving it.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.900
How long you been out of training?

06:55.940 --> 06:56.940
About four months.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.380
- Four months?
- Yeah. Wow.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.580
Full on, you're our
best rookie.

07:01.660 --> 07:03.980
- How long you been railroading?
- 28 years.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.380
November 13, 1981. 28 years.

07:07.140 --> 07:08.460
What did you do before that?
Oh...

07:10.100 --> 07:11.540
I do not know. Bunch of different jobs.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.180
No railroad.
Nah, just uh...

07:15.500 --> 07:16.940
I did something different.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.500
Something different?

07:19.900 --> 07:21.620
What do you mean, something better?

07:21.820 --> 07:22.860
Something ...

07:23.460 --> 07:25.180
- Just different?
- Different.

07:31.140 --> 07:34.380
Dewey, don't want to rush you?
I'd like to eat lunch at some point.

08:00.420 --> 08:01.380
Yes.
Hey.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.580
Your lawyer just called.

08:03.780 --> 08:04.820
You got a break.

08:04.940 --> 08:06.540
The hearing was moved up to this morning.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.660
Looks like we're going home.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.220
That's great, but ...

08:16.060 --> 08:18.420
Did you tell them I was working?
I can't come in.

08:18.460 --> 08:20.780
Yes, yes, yes.
He said no problem.

08:20.780 --> 08:23.060
- It's looking good.
- All right.

08:25.260 --> 08:28.740
Call me an hour to see what's happening.
- I will, Give me a call.

08:30.460 --> 08:31.900
You're ready to pull out or what?

08:32.460 --> 08:33.740
Coming.

08:34.860 --> 08:35.940
All right.

08:36.299 --> 08:37.860
We're leaving.

08:44.660 --> 08:46.100
What's our fuel guages?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.700
- Fuel guage?
- 2900.

08:48.740 --> 08:49.740
2900?

08:50.420 --> 08:52.740
Parking brake released.

08:52.780 --> 08:53.900
Good, good, good.

08:53.980 --> 08:55.340
Bulletins updated.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.740
Revision done, reserves as well.

08:57.740 --> 08:58.700
We are ready to go.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.100
Good. All right.

09:16.260 --> 09:19.500
29 cars, there are 10 to go, you're good.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.220
29 so far ...

09:30.060 --> 09:31.380
Dewey.

09:31.980 --> 09:32.940
Dewey?

09:33.540 --> 09:35.060
Hold your horses.

09:36.700 --> 09:37.740
What's wrong?

09:37.860 --> 09:39.860
The damn switch is not pulled.

09:40.060 --> 09:41.900
Track's not for D16.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.500
What's up?
What's your stopping distance?

09:43.820 --> 09:46.220
At least 20 cars to a stop.
Damn it!

09:46.300 --> 09:48.300
Can we back up, we still
have a little time.

09:50.820 --> 09:52.140
Off.

09:52.260 --> 09:53.820
Do not leave that cab, man.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.900
Don't worry, I'll set the independent.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.340
Dewey!

10:06.540 --> 10:08.100
Come on, come back.

10:08.420 --> 10:09.340
Dewey!

10:09.460 --> 10:10.580
Better get back on.

10:10.700 --> 10:12.300
I'm on it, I'm on it.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.100
Damn!

10:32.940 --> 10:34.020
Shit.

10:39.580 --> 10:41.500
You better get back on on, dickhead.

10:55.420 --> 10:56.460
Shit!

11:05.700 --> 11:06.940
I'm an idiot.

11:07.140 --> 11:08.300
An idiot.

11:15.180 --> 11:16.740
God damn it!

11:17.980 --> 11:19.620
Now, what the hell do we do?

11:36.020 --> 11:37.380
Nicole's birthday.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.340
Shoo
t.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.300
Ooh, you're trouble.

11:53.780 --> 11:57.060
Don't talk about it.
Put your sister on the phone, please.

11:58.860 --> 12:00.220
Dad.

12:01.460 --> 12:02.820
She doesn't want to talk with you.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.980
What? Listen ... just tell her that I didn't
forgot what day it is ...

12:07.220 --> 12:08.940
Just ... I was running late.

12:08.980 --> 12:10.700
She's gotta date tonight.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.500
With who?

12:14.340 --> 12:15.580
Just put your sister on the phone.

12:15.620 --> 12:16.820
Wait, here she is.

12:24.420 --> 12:25.460
Nikki.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.660
Nikki.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.740
- Hello.
- Listen, Just, I ...

12:31.420 --> 12:33.260
Eh, look, I didn't forget... I

12:51.660 --> 12:54.380
Frank, the coaches are already there.
What's wrong?

12:54.500 --> 12:57.260
No, it's no problem...
except, you got it backwards.

12:57.740 --> 13:00.980
Turntable house goes on my end,
you're on the ballast.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.420
On my end.

13:02.540 --> 13:05.500
Other than that, no problem.
No problem at all.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.020
Like I told you,

13:17.100 --> 13:19.700
if you do not know something,
just ask, that's all.

13:20.940 --> 13:22.020
Got it.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.660
I hope so.

13:26.540 --> 13:27.700
Whatever.

13:28.660 --> 13:29.700
Excuse me?

13:30.260 --> 13:34.100
Shit, let's make the new guy
prove himself bullshit.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.420
Gotta tell you, I heard it before.
It gets old really fast.

13:37.460 --> 13:40.060
Well, that's how it is at
the retirement home.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.300
The company wants to get rid
of us old heads,

13:46.340 --> 13:48.300
They give all the jobs to you new guys.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.100
You, yellow vests.

13:50.540 --> 13:52.820
I not trying to take anything
from anybody.

13:52.940 --> 13:54.060
As reassuring as that is,

13:55.420 --> 13:57.540
a lot of guys don't see it that way.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.220
I'm here. I'm walking in right now.

14:22.340 --> 14:25.380
I got a car full of donuts for those kids.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.500
Coaster, what train?

14:27.500 --> 14:28.620
Connie.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.780
How the hell did this happen?

14:30.820 --> 14:32.460
- It got away.
- It GOT away from you?

14:32.860 --> 14:34.700
It's a train, Dewey, not a chipmonk.

14:34.780 --> 14:37.180
I had to get off to throw a switch.

14:37.260 --> 14:38.540
You got off the cab?

14:38.620 --> 14:40.540
Ya. It's gets worse ...
Uh ...

14:41.500 --> 14:44.580
Air brakes weren't tied on.
They aren't tied on, still.

14:44.940 --> 14:49.580
We've gotta unmanned train rolling into
opposing traffic, with no airbrakes?

14:49.580 --> 14:50.660
That's what you to tell me?

14:50.700 --> 14:51.660
I set the independent brakes.

14:51.700 --> 14:52.540
That'll for sure stop it.

14:52.620 --> 14:53.620
How fast is it going?

14:53.780 --> 14:54.940
No more than 10 miles per.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.340
OK, go jump on the highway
and go after it.

14:57.820 --> 15:00.140
- Now!
- Okay. Ballbuster.

15:08.460 --> 15:09.620
Call the field trip.

15:09.740 --> 15:13.580
I do not care where they are on the mainline,
we need to get them to the nearsest siding.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.340
Train Campaign, Train Campaign
this is dispatch, do you copy?

15:20.100 --> 15:22.700
Train Campaign. Answering dispatch,
how can I help you? Over.

15:22.780 --> 15:26.140
Campaign, this is Fuller. There is an
unauthorized activity on your track.

15:26.180 --> 15:29.100
We you to divert to a siding at Portfield.

15:30.380 --> 15:31.500
Dispatch, please repeat.

15:32.780 --> 15:33.660
Please repeat, over.

15:33.740 --> 15:37.180
What time is train time?

15:37.260 --> 15:39.100
Anytime.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.780
Divert to a siding at Portfield.
Do you copy?

15:41.900 --> 15:44.780
I copy. I'll divert to a siding
at Portfield? Over.

15:50.060 --> 15:52.300
Get me Triple 7's cargo information.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.540
I have to call corporate and report this.

15:54.940 --> 15:57.260
Now, Dewey said he aplied the independents

15:57.340 --> 16:00.420
So, the friction should stop the damn
thing that after a few miles.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.100
But, we need to alert every northbound
train on the the main line.

16:03.140 --> 16:05.580
The first 20 miles of track take priority.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.300
I don't care if you're talking about
spot welding or

16:10.380 --> 16:14.340
ground operations in Afghanistan.

16:14.380 --> 16:16.340
- It's all about precision.
- Right.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.300
Thanks.

16:17.420 --> 16:19.220
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.340
Hello?

16:21.460 --> 16:22.580
Ned, where are you?

16:22.700 --> 16:25.740
Oh, Connie, hey. Um. I'm just
driving in now.

16:25.940 --> 16:26.900
I gotta go.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.300
Well, how far are you from milepost 5?

16:28.380 --> 16:30.740
Roughly, 6 minutes.
Traffic, contingent.

16:30.780 --> 16:33.180
Great, I need you to haul ass over there
to throw a siding switch.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.380
Because we have a coaster.

16:34.420 --> 16:35.820
A coaster? Really?

16:35.940 --> 16:38.700
Yep, it should be at milepost 5
in 15 minutes.

16:38.820 --> 16:42.660
Enough time to go to the switch,
get it off the mainline and onto that siding.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.660
- You want me to climb on board and stop it?

16:44.780 --> 16:46.900
What? No, no, no.
We got two arses on their way on the road

16:46.900 --> 16:48.300
you just throw that switch, Ned.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.180
Roger, that.

16:50.060 --> 16:51.980
Can always count on him,
to be late.

16:52.820 --> 16:54.060
I'll see you later.

16:54.540 --> 16:55.500
See ya.

17:08.579 --> 17:10.780
What do we do when we get to
a railroad crossing?

17:10.819 --> 17:12.619
Stop! Look! And, Listen!

17:13.380 --> 17:14.339
I can't hear you!

17:14.420 --> 17:16.180
Stop! Look! And, Listen!

17:38.140 --> 17:39.180
Stanton you know?

17:40.260 --> 17:41.700
Yes. Ever.

17:42.740 --> 17:45.060
My whole family's from Stanton.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.220
You married?

17:49.420 --> 17:50.380
Yes.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.060
Well, sorta. It's a long story.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.620
Got a long day.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.220
How about you, Frank?

18:03.380 --> 18:04.820
It's a short story.

18:04.980 --> 18:06.020
Once.

18:06.060 --> 18:07.940
I have two beautiful daugthers. Though

18:07.980 --> 18:09.420
The 18 and 19 years.

18:10.020 --> 18:12.140
Both waitressing trying to work their way to college.

18:12.220 --> 18:13.660
- Yes?
- Yes.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.100
Where at?

18:15.180 --> 18:16.460
Hooters.

18:18.260 --> 18:19.340
Hooters.

18:19.660 --> 18:20.860
The so is called.

18:21.740 --> 18:24.540
That's right, Hooters.
Clear that grin off your face.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.460
- I am a fan.
- Yes.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.780
You're blushing.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.420
I'm used to it.

18:34.020 --> 18:35.300
I'm used to it.

18:42.460 --> 18:44.380
Connie, a call on line 2.

18:46.580 --> 18:48.300
This is Connie Fuller at xxx yard.

18:49.380 --> 18:50.420
On hold.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.420
Did I hear, you gotta coaster?

18:56.460 --> 18:58.300
Yeah, that sorta thing happens,
We're on it.

18:58.340 --> 19:00.300
You want a triple relay?

19:00.660 --> 19:03.500
Listen, I need to speak to
Mr. Darby, directly.

19:05.420 --> 19:07.340
I see. Um, can you
have him call me, then?

19:08.660 --> 19:11.540
No, I'm about to release it myself...

19:13.420 --> 19:14.620
Who the hell are you?

19:14.900 --> 19:16.620
I'm here for the railway
safety campaign.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.380
Scott Werner, the regional authority.

19:18.460 --> 19:21.740
Federal Safety Inspector. I'm supposed
to give a presentation to the children ...

19:21.820 --> 19:22.860
Awesome.
Bunny!

19:22.980 --> 19:24.900
Bunny!
Can you help me out here?

19:25.140 --> 19:26.340
You see this guy right there?

19:26.420 --> 19:28.980
- He's gonna tell you what track. Okay?
- Thank you for your alignment

19:28.980 --> 19:31.420
Thanks, beautiful.
- I'm glad you liked it. Great.

19:50.620 --> 19:53.300
Shit. Where the hell is this thing?

19:54.460 --> 19:56.860
Hazardous Material

20:00.300 --> 20:01.380
Bunny!

20:01.460 --> 20:05.580
I need to know exactly what's in cars
7 to 10. Get a hold of the shipper, please.

20:13.180 --> 20:14.540
Kiddin me.

20:21.820 --> 20:24.300
- Where's the train?
- What doesit look like the God damned train is?

20:24.420 --> 20:25.460
I do not know where it is

20:25.620 --> 20:27.540
You think I hid
in my back pocket?

20:27.540 --> 20:28.940
- You said ...
- Give me a Connie.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.660
- You're a jackassl.
- Its Ned.

20:30.740 --> 20:33.820
- I do not know anything.
- You two have given it in the bar.

20:34.420 --> 20:36.980
Shut the fuck up.
I had to pull the emergency line.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.140
Connie, its Ned.

20:38.220 --> 20:39.380
Did you throw that switch yet?

20:39.500 --> 20:41.780
Yes, 6 minutes ago.
But your train is not here.

20:41.820 --> 20:44.100
I thought it might be going a little
slower than you guessed.

20:44.220 --> 20:47.180
But these two numbnuts that you sent, just
showed up and haven't seen it either.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.700
Are you saying our train has
already passed?

20:48.740 --> 20:50.540
Yes ma'am, that would be my guess.

20:51.060 --> 20:52.820
It's not a coaster, that train
is under power.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.380
That would be my guess, too.

20:54.980 --> 20:56.380
Put Dewey on the phone.

20:56.660 --> 20:58.380
Sure.
He wants to talk with you, asshole.

20:58.980 --> 21:01.660
- I need you to rally
every cell in that brain of yours.

21:01.780 --> 21:02.820
When you applied the independent

21:02.900 --> 21:05.300
was the trottle in the
forward position?

21:05.340 --> 21:07.140
Yeah, I had to get it moving.

21:07.220 --> 21:10.300
In what position was the
trottle set?

21:10.340 --> 21:12.420
Damn it, Dewey, in what position?

21:13.580 --> 21:17.420
Connie, the trottle was in notch 8,
full power.

21:17.420 --> 21:19.820
OK, it was 39 cars.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.180
OK. Take the southbound track...

21:27.380 --> 21:30.540
Catch up, see if it's still going
slow enough for one of your...

21:30.740 --> 21:31.900
You've got until ...

21:32.020 --> 21:34.380
milepost 13, where the track splits.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.020
Let me talk to Ned, again.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.300
Nice job, asshole.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.780
Ned, I want to go back to your car
and follow the main line, okay?

21:46.820 --> 21:48.220
I want to somebody on that train.

21:48.260 --> 21:50.060
You've got it. Roger, that.

22:00.980 --> 22:01.860
Do not you hear.

22:01.940 --> 22:05.300
The railway is safe.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.020
Yes!

23:01.100 --> 23:02.220
You're good.

23:04.260 --> 23:05.900
Keep it coming, you've got 10 yards.

23:08.580 --> 23:09.620
20 feet.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.060
Slow 'er down.

23:13.180 --> 23:14.420
All right, you're good.

23:29.580 --> 23:30.860
Yeah, what's going on?

23:31.500 --> 23:32.780
Got a minute?

23:37.460 --> 23:39.500
I thought he said it was looking good.

23:39.860 --> 23:41.020
That's what he thought.

23:41.220 --> 23:44.300
Turns out the judge they
assigned was a real hardass.

23:44.900 --> 23:45.860
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Look.

23:45.900 --> 23:48.500
The restraining order is being
continued for another 30 days.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.900
30 days?
What am I supposed to do for 30 days?

23:51.020 --> 23:54.380
- Stay away from my kid?
And, then, there's a hearing after that, I guess.

23:56.380 --> 23:58.100
What's taking you so long, Will?

23:58.980 --> 24:00.980
Call that lawyer and you tell
him to stick it up his ass ...

24:01.020 --> 24:02.700
Will, pick up the radio.
I gotta go.

24:03.300 --> 24:06.260
Will pick up the radio.
Over.

24:07.620 --> 24:08.780
Are you there?

24:09.300 --> 24:11.460
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Get off the phone,

24:11.540 --> 24:13.140
Knock off the handbrakes.
Get up here.

24:13.220 --> 24:14.620
Time to go.
We got work to do.

24:14.900 --> 24:15.980
Copy.

24:27.380 --> 24:30.540
No, it's definitely under power,
we're not sure of the exact speed, yet.

24:30.580 --> 24:33.660
Why don't all these trains have some
kind of dead man brake.

24:33.740 --> 24:36.780
There's a rod the engineer has to hit per-
iodically or airbrakes automatically applied.

24:36.820 --> 24:39.780
Unfortunately, this trains airbrakes
were disconnected.

24:39.860 --> 24:42.660
Sir, I would gladly explain the particulars
of locomotive operation to you

24:42.860 --> 24:44.860
if we had time, but right now

24:44.940 --> 24:48.020
I really need your assistance to post two
officers at all crossings.

24:48.060 --> 24:49.180
One question.

24:49.940 --> 24:51.660
How do you all plan to stop him?

24:52.540 --> 24:54.260
We're working on it.

24:56.380 --> 24:58.220
Go, go, go. Switch coming up.

25:06.900 --> 25:09.780
- Are you sure that you can do this?
- Get me along side the cab.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.180
- Get along side of it.
- I'm trying.

25:22.100 --> 25:23.340
Go, go, go.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.540
There's little.

25:35.540 --> 25:37.180
You got it. Go, go.

25:40.140 --> 25:41.220
Dewey ...

25:41.580 --> 25:42.940
It's too fast, speed up.

25:43.220 --> 25:45.060
Come on, give it up.
Jump, jump.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.380
Come on, man, do it!

25:56.860 --> 25:58.300
Danny, take care!

26:03.540 --> 26:05.220
Now what the hell are we doing?

26:19.620 --> 26:21.740
How many cars we supposed
to cut in?

26:23.660 --> 26:24.500
20. Why?

26:25.100 --> 26:26.220
20 cars. OK.

26:26.620 --> 26:28.340
See the switch there, up ahead of us?

26:28.940 --> 26:29.980
- The switch over there.
- Yes.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.180
Look in the mirror.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.820
You see the one behind us?

26:34.300 --> 26:36.140
Way back there, you see it?

26:36.300 --> 26:39.100
That's exactly 21 cars
between the two stands.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.740
Do not ask me where I know.

26:40.820 --> 26:44.780
So, why is it that there's still more
than 4 and a half more cars yet to clear?

26:47.820 --> 26:48.980
Because ...

26:49.420 --> 26:51.180
- Excuse me?
- Because I ...

26:51.340 --> 26:54.300
- Because I cut too many cars.
- Too many cars?

26:55.340 --> 26:59.060
Maybe if you we're not on my ass, all the
time, I'd be able to think straight.

26:59.220 --> 27:02.100
- What do you mean, maybe it's my fault?
- I have done this to exercise.

27:02.100 --> 27:04.140
I'm just saying we should do the job.

27:07.020 --> 27:08.780
If you were ready,
you would not put 5 more.

27:08.780 --> 27:10.020
It was your fault.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.020
I had my training, all right?

27:12.140 --> 27:14.340
Yes, but we're in the real world,
this ain't training.

27:14.540 --> 27:17.300
In training they just give you an "F".
Out here, you get killed.

27:17.740 --> 27:18.940
I screwed up, OK?

27:19.140 --> 27:21.140
Stop. Roll back and I'll
cut the extra cars.

27:21.180 --> 27:22.300
What? Roll back?

27:23.660 --> 27:26.580
Oh, Lord, we can't stop out
here on the main.

27:26.620 --> 27:29.220
We can't go miles on
the Main Line, and then stop.

27:29.260 --> 27:32.780
You don't take accounts this size, that
distance in reverse.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.100
Then, let's turn in, the next siding.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.900
Next siding is not for 10 miles.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.020
If you do that, we'll be late.
I don't want to be late.

27:41.420 --> 27:44.860
- We have the green light.
- Green light, my ass.

27:45.260 --> 27:47.460
What do you mean, my ass.
You're a Colson.

27:47.660 --> 27:48.300
What does that mean?

27:48.420 --> 27:50.820
- Ask your uncle.
- It's my uncle?

27:50.940 --> 27:54.900
- No, it's about five cars in addition.
- A time to stop and cut them loose?

27:55.500 --> 27:57.540
You're the engineer, but it's
God damned my train.

27:57.620 --> 27:59.260
- Yes, it's your train.
- I am wretched chief of the train.

27:59.300 --> 28:00.900
- That's true.
- 1206, check in.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.540
Well, you sure, I'll green
sheet your ass.

28:02.540 --> 28:03.500
The so think?

28:03.620 --> 28:05.900
1206, this is the dispatcher.
What's your location? Over.

28:06.940 --> 28:08.100
- Is something funny?
- No.

28:08.500 --> 28:11.340
- Then why are you laughing?
- Because it's funny.

28:11.540 --> 28:12.780
You're a funny guy.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.820
Well trained, but funny.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.140
Yes, there are 1206.

28:17.700 --> 28:19.420
We're 60 miles from Wilkinson.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.420
At 40 minutes out of Fuller yard.

28:21.540 --> 28:22.780
Negative, 1206.

28:22.860 --> 28:25.180
Pull your train to the next siding,
until further instructed. Over.

28:25.220 --> 28:26.420
What's up?

28:26.540 --> 28:30.020
There's another man's train out of
Fuller, on the Northbound track. Over.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.060
On our track!?

28:34.020 --> 28:35.180
A coaster?

28:35.260 --> 28:38.420
We don't have all the details yet. Just
proceed to the next siding, hold tight. Over.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.940
Next siding is not for ten miles.

28:41.500 --> 28:42.700
Control to 1206.

28:42.860 --> 28:45.420
Get to that siding and sit tight,
'til we give you the all clear. Over.

28:45.580 --> 28:46.700
Affirmative.

28:50.060 --> 28:51.660
It's coming right at us.

29:00.300 --> 29:04.060
More word on that runaway freight train
in rural Pennsylvania.

29:04.180 --> 29:06.260
The train, AWVR 777,

29:06.380 --> 29:08.460
Otherwise known as the "Triple 7"

29:08.660 --> 29:10.700
left Fuller yard
in northern Pennsylvania

29:10.700 --> 29:12.620
sometime before 8 A.M. this morning.

29:12.780 --> 29:14.340
And, no one on board.

29:14.540 --> 29:16.540
Live, local, late breaking...

29:16.620 --> 29:19.220
The engineer, they say, made an error
in controlling the train.

29:19.700 --> 29:23.060
Before leaving the locomotive, he attempted
to apply the independent brakes.

29:23.260 --> 29:25.260
And then, by the time he
realized his mistake,

29:25.460 --> 29:27.980
the train was going too fast
for him to climb back on.

29:28.140 --> 29:31.140
We're being told now by a spokesman for
the Public Utilities Commission,

29:31.220 --> 29:33.820
that this employee will
be held accountable.

29:42.660 --> 29:43.900
- Connie.
- Yes.

29:43.980 --> 29:46.380
Headquarters on the phone.
It's Galvin.

29:53.700 --> 29:54.740
Mr Galvin, how are you?

29:54.860 --> 29:57.940
- God damn it, how could this happen?
- It was an unfortunate combination of

29:58.020 --> 30:00.500
human error and bad luck.

30:00.820 --> 30:01.660
Luck?

30:01.780 --> 30:03.900
I was a yardmaster for 10 years,
Ms Hooper

30:03.940 --> 30:06.060
Luck has no
business in a rail yard.

30:06.380 --> 30:07.980
What are you worried about,
in terms of cargo?

30:08.100 --> 30:10.020
Well, obviously the diesel fuel is a concern.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.740
I said, cargo.

30:12.140 --> 30:15.980
OK, well, cars 7-10 and 16-19 have a
chemical called molten phenol

30:15.980 --> 30:19.820
and we're still trying to connect with the
shipper to determine exactly what that is.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.620
It's used in the manufacture of glue.

30:21.660 --> 30:23.180
Can you hold on one moment?

30:24.420 --> 30:26.620
- You know what is phenol?
- Yes.

30:29.140 --> 30:31.620
Uh... Mr Galvin, we have a
FRS inspector with us.

30:31.900 --> 30:33.420
I can put you on speakerphone?

30:36.940 --> 30:38.420
Region 2 Federal Safety Inspector,

30:38.540 --> 30:41.100
- Scott Werner. How can I help you?
- Please tell me what you know about molten phenol.

30:43.020 --> 30:44.380
Well, look, it's serious stuff.

30:45.780 --> 30:47.460
Um, very toxic, highly combustible.

30:47.500 --> 30:48.660
Well, that's terrific.

30:48.700 --> 30:52.340
Hooper, get state police back on the line,
make sure they have a HAZMAT team briefed and ready?

30:52.740 --> 30:55.220
And, asked them to put a spotter chopper over triple 7.

30:55.340 --> 30:56.780
I take it you sided all rail
traffic?

30:56.860 --> 30:58.860
On our end, yes.
Bruster's notifying his own.

30:58.980 --> 31:01.660
Sir, how are we going to handle this?

31:01.740 --> 31:05.580
I mean, this train is on route to pass
through some highly populated areas.

31:05.700 --> 31:08.860
We have a strategy call in ... about 2 minutes.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.420
- All right, I'll be ready.
- You will not be on the call, Ms. Hooper.

31:13.180 --> 31:15.100
- Excuse me?
- You will be advised.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.020
We now coordinate with local authorities.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.300
God knows, we have more than 100
crossings that need to be secured.

31:20.660 --> 31:23.780
173. Railroad crossings.

31:24.020 --> 31:27.020
Between here and AWVR substation
in Bruster.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.500
Listen ... Mr Galvin,

31:30.540 --> 31:34.100
this train is half a mile long
and it's traveling at speed

31:34.220 --> 31:36.620
into population,
with 8 freight cars

31:36.700 --> 31:39.980
of hazardous chemicals
and 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel.

31:40.140 --> 31:42.540
So, we're not just talking a train here,

31:42.940 --> 31:44.660
we're talking about a missile

31:44.860 --> 31:46.580
the size of the Chrysler building.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.260
So, what is your point, Miss Hooper?

31:48.300 --> 31:50.220
My point is, after it crosses into Finley,

31:50.260 --> 31:51.860
are about 12 miles of vacant farmland.

31:51.980 --> 31:55.420
But after that, it's nothing but
town after town.

31:55.460 --> 31:56.580
All the way to Stanton.

31:56.660 --> 31:58.100
We have a very limited window here.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.620
So, what are suggesting that
we do, derail it?

32:01.380 --> 32:02.860
Yes, sir, I am.

32:03.100 --> 32:04.460
While we still can.

32:11.340 --> 32:14.220
Mr Galvin, I understand that's going
to cost the company a lot of money.

32:14.420 --> 32:15.620
Do you think!?

32:15.860 --> 32:18.940
Miss Hooper, we are not intentionally
going to destroy one of our own trains.

32:19.220 --> 32:20.940
Not when we can still stop it.

32:21.060 --> 32:22.420
We can avoid more losses.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.740
I'm going to extend to you, my last ounce
of goodwill, pretend this conversation never happened.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.620
As if I'm worried about my job.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.620
Findlay
Northern Pennsylvania.

32:40.540 --> 32:41.420
Ma'am,

32:41.500 --> 32:43.020
please stay in your van.

32:43.060 --> 32:43.980
Let's go.

32:44.100 --> 32:45.260
Please, remain in the van.

32:45.340 --> 32:47.940
You can tell us what's going on.
All crossings are closed off for 20 miles.

32:48.020 --> 32:49.940
Ma'am, for your safety,
you please get back into your van.

32:49.980 --> 32:52.060
I'm not getting back into the vehicle,
we need to know what's going on.

33:12.980 --> 33:14.540
Get out of there. Train's coming.

33:30.780 --> 33:31.980
Off the line.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.739
1206 to dispatch.
Over.

34:17.420 --> 34:18.380
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

34:18.460 --> 34:20.179
We're not going to fit in that siding,
that's the problem.

34:20.300 --> 34:22.020
1206 to dispatch.
Over.

34:22.780 --> 34:24.020
1206, you in the siding yet.

34:24.620 --> 34:25.659
What's your location?

34:25.739 --> 34:27.580
We're not going to make it.

34:27.659 --> 34:29.580
Can't do it.
Too much train.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.460
I'm going to need you to realign the
switch so we can proceed to the next siding.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.060
1206, you have to get off the main.
Over.

34:35.219 --> 34:37.260
I understand. But you have to
understand this. We're not going to fit.

34:37.300 --> 34:38.219
I'll hold.

34:38.420 --> 34:39.580
1206, stand by.

34:39.659 --> 34:42.179
That siding is a good 3,000 feet,
head to head.

34:42.659 --> 34:43.699
Check your timetable.

34:43.820 --> 34:46.340
It's going to tell you the siding
is 4,111 feet.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.940
But that's the signal to the signal.

34:48.980 --> 34:51.500
In reality, it's more like 2,500 feet.

34:51.580 --> 34:53.820
You add those five cars
that YOU picked up.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.900
- We can fit.
- No, we won't fit.

34:57.139 --> 34:58.020
Dispatch, this is 1206.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.420
Can you tell us where the nearest
rip track is?

35:00.460 --> 35:02.340
1206, there's one in 6.2 miles.

35:02.380 --> 35:03.660
How fast are you going?

35:03.860 --> 35:05.300
55 miles an hour.

35:05.460 --> 35:07.340
1206, go faster. Over.

35:07.460 --> 35:08.780
Why, is that coaster still
on the main?

35:08.860 --> 35:12.340
1206, Triple 7 is not a coaster.
I repeat, is not a coaster.

35:12.420 --> 35:13.380
Over.

35:14.060 --> 35:15.500
You telling me it's under power?

35:15.660 --> 35:17.300
Get in the God damned siding.

35:18.660 --> 35:20.460
1206, stand by.

35:25.660 --> 35:28.980
1206, if you're going for it, that rip
track is confirm vacant.

35:29.420 --> 35:32.180
It's your call, Frank. We need to
throw the switch, if you're staying on.

35:32.220 --> 35:34.300
We're both staying on,
pull the brake, Frank.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.100
Pull the brake,.
I know what what the hell I'm doing.

35:37.180 --> 35:38.660
Bullshit, you're gonna get us killed.
Hey!

35:39.500 --> 35:40.940
1206, I need an answer.

35:43.140 --> 35:44.940
Realign it ... the switch.
Over.

36:05.300 --> 36:06.540
Train was just going, no one in it.
It just took off.

36:07.420 --> 36:10.100
They were yelling over the radio, earlier.
There was a runaway train coming through.

36:10.220 --> 36:13.940
Could be coming to our town next. And, the
high school is right next to those train tracks.

36:14.060 --> 36:17.220
Just a few moments ago, this train came
barreling down these tracks.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.780
Looking at the numbers?
Should 777 derail,

36:21.660 --> 36:23.260
we're looking at a major disaster.

36:23.660 --> 36:25.620
If one of those Phenol vapor cars blew...

36:25.660 --> 36:27.580
can easily decimate an entire town.

36:27.660 --> 36:29.700
That train is carrying eight of them.

36:31.900 --> 36:35.380
Environmental liability, track damage,
car and locomotive loss.

36:36.500 --> 36:39.980
We're looking at a projected cost,
easily over a $100 million.

36:40.180 --> 36:41.980
And the resulting stock devaluation?

36:42.060 --> 36:44.180
Our projections indicate,
it could be ... in the

36:45.100 --> 36:46.700
30-40 % range.

36:47.540 --> 36:49.740
I say we vote for Mr Galvin's option.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.420
I've already prepared for a
substation at Bruster,

36:53.500 --> 36:54.940
They just need a go-ahead.

36:55.140 --> 36:56.300
You have it.

36:58.980 --> 37:00.780
Okay, everybody out.

37:01.580 --> 37:04.820
Hoffman, you stay here, Baker, get me
a track schematic Fuller to Stanton.

37:18.940 --> 37:20.100
This is Owen.

37:20.580 --> 37:23.740
71, 70, 71, that's
with a gun.

37:27.060 --> 37:29.340
- So the red means ...
- Triple 7 blew through a signal.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.700
Everything in red means trouble
on the Main line.

37:31.740 --> 37:32.980
That's a lot of red.

37:33.060 --> 37:35.260
Connie, Mr Galvin on line 2.

37:38.060 --> 37:39.180
This is Connie Hooper.

37:39.860 --> 37:42.180
Have all the mainline crossings
been closed?

37:42.380 --> 37:44.860
Yes, we have coordinated with PSP.

37:44.940 --> 37:46.300
You have established strategy in place?

37:46.340 --> 37:47.660
It's already under way.

37:58.220 --> 37:59.460
By the activity going
on behind me,

37:59.540 --> 38:02.900
it is evident that a plan to
stop the runaway train is under way.

38:03.580 --> 38:06.660
But for now,
nobody at AWVR is commenting.

38:10.700 --> 38:15.180
We just witnessed AWVR employee, Ryan
Scott, boarding a rescue helicopter.

38:15.780 --> 38:19.620
He is a 22 year old Marine vet,
who just returned from Afghanistan.

38:24.980 --> 38:27.780
- I now need a police escort, now.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.140
It says here you're a welder?

38:31.220 --> 38:34.020
Lead Welder!
Dude, I do got a lot of time.

38:34.220 --> 38:36.500
Look, you can call my yard,
and ask for Connie Hooper.

38:41.020 --> 38:42.380
Connie sent you?

38:42.460 --> 38:44.580
That's what I said.
I need your help.

38:53.780 --> 38:56.460
1206, this is dispatch.
1206, we ran the math.

38:56.780 --> 38:58.380
1206, if you were over 2,000,
you wouldn't have fit.

38:58.820 --> 39:00.020
Good call.
Over.

39:01.180 --> 39:03.660
Thanks, but need to know
where that train is.

39:03.820 --> 39:05.220
How far away is it?

39:05.300 --> 39:07.220
1206, we're not exactly sure.

39:07.500 --> 39:10.100
You're not sure?
Find out!

39:13.260 --> 39:16.340
I'm flying above central
Pennsylvania.

39:16.620 --> 39:19.380
In what emergency responders want to
close all activities along the line.

39:19.460 --> 39:22.700
And possibly evacuate all homes within
a mile radius of the track.

39:22.780 --> 39:26.180
There's thousands of gallons of fuel
on board, which is highly flammable.

39:26.260 --> 39:28.180
We're still awaiting word on that.

39:36.620 --> 39:38.700
This is Galvin's strategy!?

39:44.940 --> 39:46.980
Seems to be a locomotive in front

39:47.060 --> 39:48.740
in an attempt to slow it down.

39:51.620 --> 39:53.980
Now we're getting a chopper
and Ryan Scott.

39:54.060 --> 39:56.940
The company still refuses
to comment.

40:08.660 --> 40:11.540
We just learned that 26 year
rail company veteran,

40:11.660 --> 40:15.180
Judd Stewart, is at the controls of the
engine trying to stop the runaway train.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.700
This one is your plan?
A guy hanging from the helicopter?

40:53.580 --> 40:54.740
Still hauling at 55.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.940
Get her down to 40 and keep braking.

41:32.860 --> 41:33.900
Shit.

41:46.900 --> 41:50.620
That's it, keep slowing. Get her
down to 40, and we'll send our boy down.

42:04.540 --> 42:05.780
Unbelievable.

42:05.820 --> 42:06.940
Do it!

42:07.380 --> 42:08.340
Come on.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.380
Incredibly dangerous maneuver.

42:22.780 --> 42:24.620
Do it! Do it again!

42:34.500 --> 42:36.300
I'm under 40, is he on yet?

42:39.540 --> 42:40.460
Come on!

42:59.100 --> 43:01.380
Looks like Ryan is injured.

43:01.460 --> 43:02.540
He missed.

43:02.820 --> 43:03.660
Come on.

43:03.780 --> 43:06.900
Just keep braking. Try to slow.
Try to get 777 off the Main.

43:08.780 --> 43:10.220
Switch has been thrown.

43:20.660 --> 43:22.220
Slow down to hell.

43:27.180 --> 43:29.500
Slow down, slow down,
it's going too fast.

43:46.700 --> 43:48.020
Okay, okay.

44:05.420 --> 44:06.740
Holy shit.

44:08.300 --> 44:09.620
Maybe it derailed.

44:11.660 --> 44:13.860
Wow, I can't believe how
horrendous that was.

44:15.380 --> 44:17.500
Oh, my God, Galvin you asshole.

44:42.460 --> 44:43.820
Fuller yard. Fuller yard.

44:43.900 --> 44:44.860
This is 1206.

44:44.940 --> 44:48.300
We're passing milepost 5-2,
heading north on Main run.

44:48.780 --> 44:50.060
1206, who am I speaking with?

44:50.140 --> 44:51.660
Frank Barnes, the engineer.

44:51.860 --> 44:53.500
This is Connie Hooper, Yardmaster
at Fuller.

44:53.580 --> 44:55.500
Why are you still on the main line?

44:55.820 --> 44:59.060
We were directed to a siding that's a
no go. We're heading to a rip track.

44:59.220 --> 45:01.260
I just passed milepost 5-0.

45:01.460 --> 45:04.340
We need to know the location of your
yard's train.

45:04.380 --> 45:06.980
It just passed milepost 47.

45:08.020 --> 45:09.060
Holy shit.

45:17.420 --> 45:20.380
They tried to side it when it jumped the
switch and derailed the lash-up.

45:20.460 --> 45:21.540
Lash-up?

45:21.780 --> 45:22.980
Who was driving?

45:23.740 --> 45:26.140
Company employee for 26 years,
Judd Stewart was killed today

45:26.220 --> 45:28.340
trying to stop the train
in central Pennsylvania.

45:28.820 --> 45:29.980
Judd Stewart.

45:30.860 --> 45:32.100
Stewart?

45:32.780 --> 45:34.100
You said, Stewart?

45:34.500 --> 45:36.700
Judd Stewart, an engineer from Bruster.

45:41.780 --> 45:43.020
You know him?

45:51.380 --> 45:52.620
What's you power at the point?

45:54.380 --> 45:55.340
5,000 horses. She's not a hot shot,

45:55.620 --> 45:58.980
but, she's a ... still got some
life left in her. Over.

45:59.260 --> 46:00.300
Give her all you got.

46:00.420 --> 46:02.340
Tell Galvin we got two guys on
the Main line, about to

46:02.420 --> 46:04.060
to play chicken with our our train.

46:11.940 --> 46:13.740
We tried to stop him.
We blew it.

46:13.940 --> 46:15.300
That train's gotta go down.

46:15.420 --> 46:18.060
- The only question is how to minimizedamage.
- Be quiet.

46:18.180 --> 46:20.860
We just learned, there is yet another
train on this track.

46:20.900 --> 46:22.980
Headed directly at the runaway.

46:23.060 --> 46:24.260
What the hell is that?

46:24.780 --> 46:27.780
We got to learn about it on ...
damn TV?

46:42.860 --> 46:44.860
Nicole, Nicole, listen, don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

46:44.900 --> 46:46.300
Dad, am busy, okay?

46:46.620 --> 46:47.940
Well. I just wanted to ...

46:48.020 --> 46:49.940
- Dad ...
- I just wanted to say that I love you.

46:49.980 --> 46:51.180
Okay, fine.

46:51.300 --> 46:54.060
- Dad, what's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing, I just ...

46:56.780 --> 46:58.340
Dad, what's wrong?

46:58.780 --> 47:00.500
Tell your sister
I love you both.

47:00.540 --> 47:01.740
Okay? I gotta go.

47:03.220 --> 47:04.540
What's happening?

47:15.660 --> 47:17.300
1206, how you holding up?

47:17.420 --> 47:19.500
I'm about a half a mile from that
rip track. Over.

47:19.700 --> 47:22.220
Chances are, you're gonna see
the triple 7, any minute.

47:22.860 --> 47:24.140
Affirmative.

47:37.540 --> 47:38.780
Why are you braking?

47:38.940 --> 47:41.820
Trust me. If we head in this hot,
We'll tear right off the track.

47:43.980 --> 47:45.020
Jeez.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.140
Get her down to 40 and brace yourself.

47:55.780 --> 47:58.300
You need to get at least 10 cars
into the siding.

48:04.620 --> 48:05.780
Yes!

48:40.900 --> 48:43.340
1206. 1206.

48:44.940 --> 48:45.980
I'm at 1206. Go.

48:46.860 --> 48:48.300
They're evacuating Arklow.

48:48.980 --> 48:50.300
They're going to derail the train.

48:50.620 --> 48:51.660
What are they using?

48:51.740 --> 48:53.140
Standard dynamite.

48:54.540 --> 48:56.100
Going to derail her.

49:00.900 --> 49:02.020
What are you doing?

49:02.220 --> 49:04.700
I got a look at that last car coupler.
It was open.

49:05.500 --> 49:08.860
If we take off right now, we can get back
on the Main. Chase it down in reverse.

49:08.940 --> 49:09.980
Woah, wait a minute.

49:10.100 --> 49:13.180
No way to stop that kind of power.
Grab it by the tail. Boom!

49:13.260 --> 49:14.220
Gun it in the opposite direction.

49:14.300 --> 49:16.820
You heard what they said, if that goes
down we'll be a wreck on a wreck.

49:17.860 --> 49:18.940
Doesn't matter.

49:19.900 --> 49:21.500
Good chance the derailer won't work.

49:21.620 --> 49:23.820
It's called a derailer
for Christ's sake.

49:23.900 --> 49:26.140
A train of this size,
going that fast

49:26.140 --> 49:28.340
- It will vaporize anything that gets inits way.
- Bullshit!

49:28.420 --> 49:30.620
- They wouldn't use it.
- They're wrong, all right?

49:30.740 --> 49:32.060
They're wrong.

49:32.540 --> 49:33.620
Are you in or are you not?

49:33.700 --> 49:35.900
If you want to get yourself killed,
you do it alone.

49:36.060 --> 49:38.060
You know what? Ask your wife what she feels.

49:38.500 --> 49:39.660
Wait.

49:43.580 --> 49:47.260
If you are right and the derailer fails,
what are the odds it makes it to Stanton?

49:47.420 --> 49:49.260
You saw the train. What do you think?

50:14.300 --> 50:16.540
1206, this is Connie Hooper,
Are you there?

50:18.820 --> 50:20.020
1206, Over.

50:20.260 --> 50:21.700
I wanted to see how you boys
are doing.

50:24.580 --> 50:26.700
We're doing about 60 miles
an hour, Connie.

50:27.940 --> 50:30.260
Sorry ... I don't understand.

50:30.340 --> 50:31.980
We're going after your train.

50:32.700 --> 50:34.060
1206, I'm not hearing you.

50:34.060 --> 50:35.420
The rear knuckle was left open, so

50:35.540 --> 50:38.420
if we can catch up,
we can tie it on our locomotive.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.940
Try and slow down triple 7.

50:40.220 --> 50:42.260
- Frank, you can't.
- We've already are.

50:42.340 --> 50:44.180
One derailer's not going to cut it,
Connie.

50:44.260 --> 50:46.100
Who said anything about the derailer?

50:46.580 --> 50:50.500
Dispatch. He said they were to evacuate
Arklow. Two plus two is four.

50:51.940 --> 50:54.060
- It's Ned, says he's still following.
- No, tell him we'll call him back.

50:54.180 --> 50:55.500
Get me to Galvin, now!

50:56.100 --> 50:59.340
Frank, that train carrying 30,000
gallons of toxic chemicals.

50:59.540 --> 51:00.580
They had a window before.

51:00.700 --> 51:03.020
But that train's going into
populated areas.

51:03.100 --> 51:04.540
There's no way they derail, now.

51:06.860 --> 51:08.180
Are you sure about that?

51:09.900 --> 51:13.180
- Look, let me make some calls.
- Make some calls, please!

51:22.780 --> 51:24.100
What do you think?
You think he can catch up?

51:24.860 --> 51:26.220
Well, possibly.

51:26.300 --> 51:29.780
But even if they do, we're talking about
coupling at 10 times the normal speed.

51:29.980 --> 51:31.100
In reverse...

51:31.580 --> 51:33.260
I thought you were in favor of derailment.

51:33.340 --> 51:34.940
Yeah, yeah, when they were in the
middle of nowhere.

51:34.980 --> 51:36.700
Not now, when its just
town after town out there.

51:36.780 --> 51:38.500
Mr. Galvin says he'll have
to call you back.

51:39.140 --> 51:40.820
This is Connie Hooper for Mr. Galvin.

51:40.900 --> 51:42.340
Mr. Galvin has a meeting.

51:42.460 --> 51:45.620
Then maybe you can tell me. Is the company
planning on derailing Triple 7?

51:45.660 --> 51:48.100
Last I heard, Galvin was
dead-set against it.

51:48.220 --> 51:51.180
Sorry, I'd like to help, but can't.

51:51.260 --> 51:53.860
No, of course you're not at liberty to.

51:54.140 --> 51:55.500
Frank's right.

52:02.780 --> 52:04.820
How fast do you think is a single
engine like this?

52:05.580 --> 52:06.940
- Unattached?
- Yeah.

52:06.940 --> 52:09.220
50, 55

52:09.900 --> 52:11.380
But, that was going forward.

52:11.420 --> 52:13.060
1206, you there?

52:13.540 --> 52:15.220
This is 1206, Over.

52:15.300 --> 52:16.260
Frank, you're right.

52:16.340 --> 52:17.860
About the derailment ...

52:18.820 --> 52:20.740
They're planning an attempt
outside of Arklow.

52:23.620 --> 52:27.100
Tell them idiots it ain't gonna work.
That portable derailer is worthless.

52:27.100 --> 52:28.420
She already told us.

52:29.500 --> 52:33.020
Frank, this is Oscar Galvin,
v.p. of operations.

52:33.220 --> 52:35.860
Patched in at his request, open mike.

52:36.500 --> 52:38.780
Yeah, we are derailing Triple 7, Frank.

52:39.180 --> 52:40.220
It's a done decision.

52:40.540 --> 52:42.820
Like it or not, it's
our best option at this stage.

52:43.220 --> 52:45.140
Less collateral damage in Arklow.

52:45.540 --> 52:49.260
It's already being evacuated. And, we can't
let Triple 7 make it to Stanton.

52:49.940 --> 52:53.580
Look, Mr Galvin, with all due respect,
I've been railroading for 28 years.

52:54.300 --> 52:56.740
I'm telling you we got a real chance
to stop this thing.

52:56.860 --> 52:57.980
No, we already tried.

52:58.380 --> 52:59.900
That was from the front.

52:59.940 --> 53:01.460
We're long hood, lean back.

53:01.660 --> 53:02.900
It's a different situation.

53:03.140 --> 53:04.700
We got more control now.

53:07.220 --> 53:09.940
What if I cancel the derailer,
and you fail, Frank? Huh...

53:10.780 --> 53:14.140
The train will be doing 70 MPH
into that elevated "S" curve at Stanton.

53:14.140 --> 53:15.940
The damage will be 100 times worse.

53:16.060 --> 53:18.140
Right, I'm just telling you,

53:18.540 --> 53:20.700
the portable derailer is worthless.

53:20.860 --> 53:23.740
You got too much train travelling
entirely too fast.

53:24.300 --> 53:27.180
Maybe 1206 should just stay on
it as a back up.

53:27.220 --> 53:31.020
But, I am not jeopardizing more
personnel and more property,

53:31.100 --> 53:34.100
just because some engineer
wants to play hero.

53:34.340 --> 53:35.540
End of discussion.

53:36.020 --> 53:38.780
That train is our property,
it's our decision.

53:40.060 --> 53:42.820
Now, you stop your pursuit
or I will fire you.

53:44.860 --> 53:46.180
You already did.

53:49.820 --> 53:51.460
Already did what?

53:52.860 --> 53:54.340
You've already fired me.

53:55.580 --> 53:57.980
I received my 90 days notice
in the mail,

53:58.460 --> 54:00.220
72 days ago.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.460
Forced early retirement, half benefits.

54:10.420 --> 54:13.820
So you're gonna risk your life for us,
with three weeks left?

54:15.740 --> 54:17.020
Not for you ...

54:18.740 --> 54:20.380
I'm not doing it for you.

54:21.500 --> 54:22.460
Frank ...

54:23.060 --> 54:24.260
Give me that.

54:28.220 --> 54:30.980
Mr Galvin, this is Will Colson,
your conductor.

54:34.180 --> 54:36.100
I'm letting you know,
we're gonna run this bitch down.

54:37.180 --> 54:40.620
Maybe you didn't hear what I just said,
Colson. I will fire you!

54:42.260 --> 54:43.620
That's too bad.

54:44.700 --> 54:46.460
I was just starting to like his job.

54:48.620 --> 54:50.020
Damn it, you listen to me.

54:50.300 --> 54:52.340
Son of a bitch, you will be fired.

54:52.380 --> 54:54.380
You're breaking up.
Sorry ...

55:00.500 --> 55:03.460
- This garbage, is not ...
- I think they're gone.

55:06.620 --> 55:08.540
Well, this is your headache, now, Hooper.

55:08.740 --> 55:12.500
Now, you get them off the Main or
consider yourself shitcanned, too.

55:14.420 --> 55:15.460
I like that.

55:16.420 --> 55:18.340
Bring up the slides of Arklow.

55:18.740 --> 55:22.380
Take a look behind me and see emergency
evacuation efforts are currently in effect

55:22.460 --> 55:24.860
right here in the tiny town of Arklow.

55:36.300 --> 55:38.780
1206 to Fuller yard.
Connie, are you there? Over.

55:38.900 --> 55:42.460
- Frank ... I'm real sorry about Galvin.
- It's okay. Listen, listen.

55:42.540 --> 55:44.460
- Is he off?
- Yeah, he's gone

55:44.500 --> 55:45.620
OK, listen up.

55:45.700 --> 55:47.420
I want you to do us a favor.

55:47.540 --> 55:51.460
I need you to keep us posted on the speed
and location of Triple 7.

55:51.580 --> 55:53.100
Location and speed.
Over.

55:55.500 --> 55:56.540
Connie?

55:58.900 --> 56:02.140
Frank, Triple 7 is 9 miles out of
Arklow. You got some catching up to do.

56:02.220 --> 56:03.460
9 miles out of Arklow.

56:18.820 --> 56:21.220
- What did you say your wife's first name?
- Darcy.

56:21.380 --> 56:23.620
So, what's the long story
you didn't want to make long?

56:26.500 --> 56:28.700
I came home from work
two weeks ago, and she's uh ...

56:29.020 --> 56:31.900
texting on the phone.
I asked her who and she told me, nobody.

56:33.220 --> 56:34.780
I said "let me see the phone"
and she says, no.

56:34.780 --> 56:36.100
And, this goes on...

56:36.500 --> 56:38.020
- Five, six times ...
- Wait, wait, you're losing me.

56:38.220 --> 56:41.580
- She's texting? - There's this guy
we both went to school with.

56:41.660 --> 56:43.700
He's a cop. He's a PA state trooper.

56:43.820 --> 56:45.980
He's always had a thing for Darcy,
since we met.

56:46.460 --> 56:47.540
1206, where are you?

56:47.620 --> 56:51.620
1206, here Connie.
I just passed milepost 57.

56:51.700 --> 56:53.540
You are about a mile and a half behind.

56:55.620 --> 56:57.460
How far out of Arklow is Triple 7?

56:57.540 --> 56:59.900
7 1/2 miles, it picked upspeed.
You better step on it.

57:00.340 --> 57:03.580
I'm stepping on it. In and around it,
through it, Connie. Thank you. Over.

57:04.900 --> 57:09.180
And the phone messages continued and
each time she continued to deny.

57:09.500 --> 57:12.140
She starts to walk away. I grab for it.

57:12.860 --> 57:14.620
- Did you hit her?
- No, no.

57:16.540 --> 57:18.980
I mean, I scared her but
I didn't hurt her.

57:21.020 --> 57:23.780
Well, anyway, I drive to this guys house,
to talk,

57:23.780 --> 57:25.260
that among men, in my car.

57:25.340 --> 57:28.340
He started to tell me that I got it
all wrong. They're just friends

57:28.740 --> 57:30.820
and he stops when he sees

57:31.900 --> 57:33.660
the gun I got sitting on the ...
- Oooh!

57:35.900 --> 57:39.100
She's my wife, you find another friend.

57:39.180 --> 57:41.420
- You pulled a gun on a cop?
- Frank?

57:41.980 --> 57:44.740
Frank, Triple 7 has just passed
milepost 61.

57:46.100 --> 57:47.300
Thank you, Connie.

57:47.380 --> 57:49.300
- Want to hear the kicker?
- Yes, I do.

57:50.260 --> 57:53.500
It wasn't even him that was texting her.
It was my sister-in-law.

57:54.820 --> 57:57.700
Hey, by the time I got home,
his buddy is waiting for me.

57:57.740 --> 58:00.500
Just waiting to serve me
with a restraining order.

58:02.620 --> 58:04.540
Darcy wouldn't even looked at me.

58:07.420 --> 58:09.420
So, now I'm living with my brother.

58:09.980 --> 58:13.460
There was a hearing today. The judge
ordered a 30 day extension.

58:16.420 --> 58:18.580
It's like, one day, everything is going
Okay, and then...

58:19.620 --> 58:22.500
the next, it's all falling apart
faster than you can put it back together.

58:22.540 --> 58:24.580
Yeah ... never too late, though.

58:34.220 --> 58:38.420
The plan to derail this 39 car
runaway train is just minutes away now.

58:38.780 --> 58:42.980
...tremendous amount of activity going on.
Will this train be able to be stopped.

58:46.300 --> 58:50.420
1206, Connie, just passed
milepost 62. Milepost 62. Over.

58:50.500 --> 58:52.340
There's still a mile gap,
maybe more.

58:52.420 --> 58:54.060
We are gaining on him, Frank.

58:54.540 --> 58:55.740
Hold on tight.

59:01.260 --> 59:02.980
Just want to shot trains.

59:03.180 --> 59:06.540
Okay, we go
Come, Be ready. It's moment of truth.

59:06.620 --> 59:08.660
Just north of Arklow.

59:11.140 --> 59:13.940
OK, Remember, it's a Red button!

59:18.940 --> 59:19.900
Now!

59:22.580 --> 59:25.460
Open fire! Open fire!
Damn!

59:25.500 --> 59:26.980
Open fire!

59:27.260 --> 59:31.740
We were aiming at the same level, by firing
shotgun rounds at the fuel stop safety switch.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.660
And So ... some shots were fired.

59:33.740 --> 59:36.500
That safety switch is a mighty small target

59:36.620 --> 59:38.980
and, it's right nex to a fuel tank.

59:43.900 --> 59:45.580
We're not going to catch him before Arklow.

59:45.580 --> 59:47.260
Frank, you're closing the gap.

59:47.380 --> 59:50.780
You should cut your speed, allow
yourself some stopping distance, just in case.

59:51.220 --> 59:54.060
No can do, Connie.
If we slow down now, we'll never catch him.

59:54.100 --> 59:55.420
Not before Stanton.
Over.

59:55.420 --> 59:56.540
It's your call.

59:57.340 --> 59:58.940
However, we have now also learned,

59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.580
that two railroad employees

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:04.820
are now in pursuit of train 777
in a single locomotive.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.740
It is unclear what's their plan ...

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.260
Connie Hooper for you.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.860
Did I or did I not tell you
to get 1206 off the Main?

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.940
I asked them nicely.
...This is impossible!

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.460
- You're 100 % sure that derailer won'twork?
- Yes. 100 %.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.500
- Now
- Which one is it?

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.860
- 50-50.
- 25.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:31.580
And if it does?

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.540
If does ... then we're
a wreck on a wreck.

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.420
I'am with engineer Jim Deveroux.
The train is getting close.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:41.500
How will this derailer work?

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.900
Well, basically, it works like a ramp.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:48.380
Train comes along, this piece here,
will lift the flange

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:50.020
and and pull it outside the rail.

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:53.900
That will cause the train
to flip over on its right hand side.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.980
Son of a bitch won't even know...

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.860
What ... What in the hell was that?

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:37.860
That ... was 10 million pounds of train,
Mr Galvin.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:40.220
And, this is the sound of me
saving your ass.

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.260
Frank, do you copy?

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.540
- Frank?
- 1206. Over.

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.580
You were right.

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.780
Jesus Christ!

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.940
Bringing you live coverage right now of
what could very well result

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:06.740
in one of the worst disasters in the
history of the state of Pennsylvania.

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.660
The particulars are still
being examined, but

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.380
authorities are far more focused

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.980
on the potential destruction that would
result if train 777

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.620
were to derail in Stanton.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.860
What did you mean
about being married once?

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.700
Alice, my wife ...she died of cancer.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:29.100
- Four years ago.
- Sorry.

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.740
Me too ...

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.860
Me too.

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.500
Every night I come home,

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.620
tell her about my day ...

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.180
where I had been ...

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.060
what I hauled.

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.460
Who annoyed me.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.300
- You can offend someone?
- You'd be amazed.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.260
You should call your wife.

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.980
I would but ... but it's her day off.
She's probably sleeping.

01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.900
Don't make excuses. Wake her up.

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.060
I called her for the past 2 weeks,
but she never called me back.

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:06.660
She won't. You got to call her,
that's how it works.

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:08.500
You quit too easy.

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:15.660
Stanton, Pennsylvania.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:16.820
Darcy!

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.100
Darcy.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:23.340
I've been calling...
and calling.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.420
What is wrong?

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.340
As we told you earlier today,

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:31.780
those emergency evacuations
began early this morning.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.020
As they try to move people out of
harms way.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.980
Yeah, I know, I'm watching TV.

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:45.820
Arklow, Pennnsylvannia

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:02.020
Two railroad employees are presently in
pursuit of Train 777

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:03.460
in a single locomotive.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.980
No one seems exactly clear on what their
plans are to catch up with that train.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.500
We just learned the railroad employee,
Frank Barnes,

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.020
a 28 year veteran of the
the train company responsible

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.580
for the runaway

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.100
and Will Colson, a conductor,

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.620
Are now on board other ...

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.180
Yes, we're on our way.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:27.300
And get this. They were travelling
at speeds up to 70 MPH ... in reverse.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.860
Triple 7 is now just
miles away

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.300
the more populated town of Stanton.

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.060
Let's go, boys!

01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:01.260
You're getting close, gap is but a mile
and Triple 7 is 10 miles to Stanton.

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.340
Now, listen, Frank.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:04.460
I got a guy here named Werner from
the FRA...

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.260
Now, I'm inclined to divert your
judgement here, but he ...

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.260
All right. Put him on.
We can use all the help that we can get.

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.860
Press this and hold to talk.

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:18.380
It's about slowing down Triple 7,
once you've tied on. I know...

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.940
I know conventional wisdon says to just
gun it in the opposite direction.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.860
But, you'll have a better shot

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.380
alternating full trottle
with dynamic braking.

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.980
Yeah. But we can't afford
to lose counter-trust.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:32.940
What you'll lose in counter-trust
will compensate for in traction force.

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.860
Are you sure about that?

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.140
Well, it's more of a hunch based on
some quick calculations.

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:41.860
It's a hunch!?

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.940
We're going 70 MPH and
he gives us a hunch.

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:47.980
Okay, thank you.
Put Connie back on, please.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.340
- It's me, Frank. - Yeah, Connie,
this guy know what he's talking about?

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:55.140
In a perfect world ...

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:57.900
Yes. I would says, yes.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.700
In a perfect world, okay.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:03.060
We now have more now on that runaway
freight train in rural Pennsylvania,

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.900
we've been advised of an ambitous plan
to bring it to a stop.

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.540
A single locomotive moves in from behind

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.260
catches up... hooks up

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.940
and then brakes
in an effort to slow it down.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.180
We passed milepost 76, Connie.
Over.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:20.060
- You're only half mile away.
- Half mile. Over.

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.660
Frank, running in reverse,
how are you going to gauge our gap distance?

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.820
I'll go out there and signal you by hand.

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.660
- At 70 MPH?
- I ask you, you need help?

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.140
All right.

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.700
Radio and hand signs to communicate.
Okay?

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.180
- Now, be careful.
- I will.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.700
- And, oh, take that vest off.
- Why?

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.460
Just take it off. I do not want to look out
this window and see a yellow vest. Freak me out.

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:06.460
Come on, answer.

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.300
Come on.

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.580
- Leave me a message...
- Damn.

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.300
Come on, Frank.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:20.820
Trying. Over.

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.140
All right, here she comes.

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.220
3 cars?

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.180
Three cars, steady. Copy.

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.420
All right. Steady! Steady!

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.020
Two cars?

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:54.420
Yeah, two cars. Steady.
Steady on one.

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.220
Keep it coming. Keep it coming.

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.980
Keep it coming!

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.020
Steady! ... Steady!

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.500
Plan go into operation

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:13.860
Will Colson is tring to hook up 1206 with
Triple 7. Coulson, the conductor...

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.060
It seems something is terribly wrong.

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.020
Will, what was that?

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.180
Lost brake fluid.

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:34.020
Are we tied on?

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.020
Will, what's going on?

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:42.220
Right now we are looking at live
pictures of this rescue operation

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.779
Are we tied on?

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:47.220
No, fricking thing didn't work.
I'll try again.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.819
Will, use hand signals.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.460
Are we tied on?

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.700
We're good, we're good.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.300
Shit!

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.620
Frank, I fell hook.

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:15.620
Repeat. What?

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.180
Are we tied in..

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.660
The locking hook pin didn't fall.

01:09:19.939 --> 01:09:20.899
What?

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.580
Pin didn't fall.
It's not a locked-in.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.220
Okay, well, look.

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:29.580
Try to get down to see what
you can do. Be careful.

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.180
Be careful.

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:40.979
Will.

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.859
Not slowing down, it's
gaining right speed now.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.460
He's reaching down
trying to couple...

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.540
Will, can you read me?

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.300
He's gone.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.940
Will Colson is down.
We do not see him.

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.340
Helicopter 43, can you zoom in

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.380
do not see that conductor, Colson.

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:25.900
Come on, baby.

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.220
Will, can you read me?

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.540
Will!

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:47.500
Chopper 43, zoom in.
There is Will Colson.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:56.060
Looks like Will Colson is in trouble.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:58.940
Shit.

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.780
Will.

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:07.660
We are now being told, that the
connection has been made.

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.980
It looks as though this train is
now attached to 1206.

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.340
1206 is successfuly attached
to the Triple 7.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.980
It looks like Will Colson is injured.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:20.620
All right?

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.060
I'm great.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.260
Don't touch that, don't touch that.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.780
Just wrap it up with this.
Wrap it real tight. All around.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.940
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, great.

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:41.060
Colson has caught up to the runaway train
and .....

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:41.940
Let's go, Darcy.

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.580
But the train continues to speed in
excess of 75 miles an hour.

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.260
Heading to Stanton.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.420
Connie, how far got?

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.980
How far is Stanton?
Over.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.180
4 miles. You guys are doing great.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.500
But, you're cutting it close, though.
How's Will?

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.780
He's, uh ...
He's different. Over.

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:04.020
Done.

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.540
You ready for a little tug-of-war?

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:10.780
Let s do it.

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.180
Match our speed with theirs ...

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:31.860
- Frank Roth.
- I know. Only scratches, that's all.

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.020
Scratches.

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:43.180
Here in Stanton, the evacuation procedures
continue for the entire town.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:47.580
This is the town where the that main line
train track turns into an elevated curve.

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.540
They say there is virtually no chance that
this speeding, out of control train

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.980
Will make it through that curve.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.660
Please slow down.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:02.780
But I'll do.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:04.700
Shit.

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:07.180
Now the dynamics.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:09.580
Open easily.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.980
Christ, slowing down.
Seems to be working.

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:26.580
Come on, Frank.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:28.020
Come on, baby.

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:34.940
What's the speed?

01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.380
We're under 50.

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.100
Connie, how far away?

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.980
3 miles. We have men on the
ground ready to hop on board.

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:44.060
- As soon as you guys get it under control.
- Tell them to be ready to hop. Over.

01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:53.300
Shit!

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.340
- What is it?
- Gaining speed.

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.140
The systems is too heavy.
Being dragged.

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:15.900
Connie!

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:17.700
I'm here, Frank.

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:19.620
We're going to be coming in too hot.

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:21.620
I do not know.

01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.740
Limit on that curve that is 15.
I do not know if you can take it much faster.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.060
Maybe 20, 25, max.

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.420
We may not have a choice.

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.620
Just tell them it's going
to be real hot.

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.580
What about the braking
of the freight cars?

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.260
Good, good.

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.380
- All right, I'm on it.
- No, no. Sit down. No, no.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.980
I've got it. Sit tight. Sit tight.
I'll go.

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:50.660
No, no, come on. You better stay here
and I go out.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.500
Just keep it at 4.

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:54.980
- You, all right? Take it easy.
- Yeah.

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:58.460
Hold that dynamic out, 4,
4, with the trottle combined.

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.420
Hold it up at 4, how you run the
clock out, doesn't matter.

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:04.380
Hey, don't get sentimental on me.

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.700
Makes me think I'm gonna die.
Just hold it at 4.

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.740
Come on, Frank.

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.700
WAVR officials have no comment.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.900
Barnes is attempting to manually
brake the last car.

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.580
Actually, Barnes is
on the train

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:47.700
leaping over cars.

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.460
Let's go, Frank.

01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:59.980
Looks like Triple 7 is slowing down.

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:08.620
Come on Dad, Kill it.

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.860
Will, how fast are you going?

01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:18.140
34.

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:22.540
We're dropping, 33 ...

01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.100
Think it'll work?

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:30.300
Theoretically.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:33.420
Provided, that locomotive's independent
brake holds up.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.540
We continue to bring you live coverage of
this breaking news event from the town of Stanton.

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:47.500
Emergency officials have created
this perimeter ...

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:56.060
Please evacuate the building,
immediately.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.180
Damn!

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.620
Frank.

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:36.980
Yeah, yeah, I hear you, I hear you.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.060
We just lost our brakes.

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.420
- They lost their brakes. High flames ...
- Shit.

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:55.740
Frank, Frank, you all right?

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:58.060
I'm here, Will, what happened?

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.740
We're picking up speed, again.

01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.580
Can you still slow him down?

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.300
We're almost at the curve.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.540
Frank, our engine block's overheated.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:14.980
I don't think those handbrakes are
going to stop it, going too fast.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.860
Just hang on to the independent.

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:18.980
I'll tell you when.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.900
Elevated and strictly class 2
speed restricted to 15 miles per hour.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:46.740
Impact with three of these buildings
directly below will be unavoidable..

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:50.300
..As will contact with all of the
fuel storage tanks situated here.

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.620
Will.

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:53.180
Will?

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.420
Okay, okay, but we take speed again.

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:10.060
Will!

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.940
We're coming into the curve!

01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:14.660
Get ready!

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:28.780
Will!

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.620
Get on the independent!

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:33.500
The independentele is hard to get.

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:41.980
We're going to jump right off.

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.780
We have no choice.

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:54.020
Will!

01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:55.380
Hang on!

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.460
Try, try again.

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:07.660
Now!

01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:34.460
Frank, you all right?

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:35.540
We made it!

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.020
We made it!
Through the turn!

01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:42.140
Triple 7 did it. It made it through
the Staton curve.

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:46.060
Triple 7 is through the Stanton curve,
but, by no means out of trouble.

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:50.580
Triple 7 is gaining speed, it is
out of control, and has to derail.

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:53.940
Frank Barnes and Will Colson will be
the victims of the

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.620
biggest rail disaster
the history of the north-east.

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:01.420
It looks like Frank Barnes is
making an all out effort...

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:07.180
This is a remarkable effort, now, to
get to the front of Triple 7.

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:13.500
Frank!

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.740
Frank, we're 60 and we're gonna
hit 80 in no time.

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.020
He's not going to make it.

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.580
It looks like the gap between cars
has stopped him.

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.540
Come on, Dad.

01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:31.580
But the train continues to speed
in excess of 75 miles an hour.

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:32.540
Frank.

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:34.300
Frank!

01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:36.860
Will! We got a problem here!

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.580
I do not think I can make it!

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.220
Oh, God!

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.780
Who's that?

01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:58.820
Unbelievable!

01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.180
Unbelievable.

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:05.260
Hello.

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:06.460
Ned, it's Connie.

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.620
I'm a little busy right now, Connie.
I'll Call you back.

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.460
Come on!

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:40.980
Jump into the back of the car!

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:44.700
Hop into the back of the truck!

01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:45.980
Connie!

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:47.980
Connie, is that truck for us?

01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.100
Yes it is, Will. You can do this.

01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:52.260
Come on, you can do this.

01:22:58.460 --> 01:22:59.500
Come on.

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:16.220
It looks like he's trying to synchronize
with the speed of the train.

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:20.140
Jump, you pussy!
Jump in the back!

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:31.860
Yes!

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.860
Look at what's happening now.
The red pick-up...

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.220
racing toward the end of the train.

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.220
Come on!

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:53.660
Frank!

01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:58.140
Go, Go, Go!

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.540
Go, go, go!

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.460
Go, go!

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:16.340
Now WIll is running out of parallel road

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:17.740
Come on, Will.

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:18.900
Come on, Come on!

01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:41.260
Come on!

01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:43.860
God damn it, over shot it.

01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:47.900
Come on.

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:50.660
Come on, damn! Do it!

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:53.260
Come on, jump!

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.100
Do it! Jump!

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:14.460
Yes!

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.380
Yes!

01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.780
Yes!

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:30.900
Oh, God!

01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:39.260
Colson, successfully making it in to
the cab, now he controls.

01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:04.060
Job of reporting 43 to you,
this remarkable aftermath.

01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.700
We're talking about the heroic work
of two men...

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:08.540
Frank Barnes and Will Colson.

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:12.460
Southern Pennsylvania
will always indebted to them.

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.260
Missed Call
Darcy.

01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.260
We did It.

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.580
I knew that when there's a job here we do it.

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.180
Good accuracy.

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.660
Good job, kid.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.900
- Ned! - Ned!
- You!

01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:40.420
Ned, were you worried?

01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:42.900
If I worried?
No, not really.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:44.780
It's all about precision.

01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:45.980
I was and she says she ...

01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.300
- Your flowers are going corporate, you know
- Yes?

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.020
Debt of gratitude ... blah, blah, blah.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.260
Same here.

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.100
They are pretty good, actually.

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.620
Yes, it did.

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:01.060
What was your first reaction when you
realized what was happening?

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.300
I felt I was in my comfort zone.

01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:06.260
- Mine was about my job?
- So was mine, didn't want to leave it.

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.660
- You'd be stupid enough to do it.
- Yeah. That's what I told them.

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.140
So, they better think about giving
me a medal, too.

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.780
- But me?
- What about you?

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.340
Do you have any better of an idea
as to how this happened?

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:35.540
- Do you want to you know how it happened?
- Thank you very much evry body ...You had an experience.

01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:38.420
Sir?

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:40.140
I wonder if you can help me.

01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:43.980
- Connie?
- I can't decide which one of you I'm going to kiss first.

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:45.140
Me!

01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:48.580
Problem solved.

01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:51.540
- Get him, Connie.
- Okay, bring it on.

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.080
Your Daughters?

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.300
Chopper 43,...
Over, and out.
