WEBVTT

00:04.030 --> 00:06.800
("Body and Soul"
by Benny Goodman playing)

00:11.137 --> 00:12.706
(car horn honks)

00:14.507 --> 00:17.643
Extree, extree!
Japanese surrender!

00:17.677 --> 00:20.646
Read all about it!
Extree, extree!

00:20.680 --> 00:21.948
I love this program.

00:21.981 --> 00:24.117
Yeah, it's really authentic.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.452
You can even smell
the automotive exhaust.

00:26.485 --> 00:29.122
I hope the safety settings
cover lead poisoning.

00:29.155 --> 00:32.792
So, listen, I keep asking
about our trip,

00:32.826 --> 00:35.328
and you keep
dodging the subject.

00:35.361 --> 00:39.465
Yeah. It's just gonna
be tough right now.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.867
Kel, come on, you have
the vacation time.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.668
Just take it. You haven't
been off in six months.

00:42.702 --> 00:44.670
We're about to enter
an unexplored region of space.

00:44.704 --> 00:46.806
It's not the right time
for me to say,

00:46.840 --> 00:48.641
"Okay, I'm taking
two weeks off. Bye."

00:48.674 --> 00:50.543
"It's not the right time."
You know, you could be

00:50.576 --> 00:52.645
saying that until you're 90
if you don't find some balance.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.714
-(chuckles)
-What?

00:54.748 --> 00:55.815
What's funny?

00:55.849 --> 00:57.984
It's nothing, it's just...

00:58.017 --> 01:00.720
I've been on the other end
of this conversation.

01:01.855 --> 01:03.923
Kel, are we okay?

01:05.859 --> 01:07.426
I don't know.

01:08.895 --> 01:11.831
What do you want out of this?
For us?

01:11.865 --> 01:15.902
To keep growing.
Getting closer.

01:15.935 --> 01:18.571
Maybe, someday, get married.

01:20.406 --> 01:22.341
Is that not what you want?

01:22.375 --> 01:26.079
I've been married.
I'm in no rush to do it again.

01:26.112 --> 01:28.581
And with this job, it makes
the whole idea even worse.

01:28.614 --> 01:30.850
Well, you know,
I have a job, too,

01:30.884 --> 01:32.585
and I feel like I make it work.

01:32.618 --> 01:34.888
-Yeah, but...
-What?

01:34.921 --> 01:36.756
It's not important.

01:36.790 --> 01:38.858
-No, you can say it.
-Say what?

01:38.892 --> 01:41.360
I'm a teacher. You're the
commander of a starship.

01:41.394 --> 01:42.695
Your job is more demanding.

01:42.728 --> 01:43.897
I didn't say that.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.598
No, but you were thinking it.

01:45.631 --> 01:47.433
Let me tell you something:
You ever...

01:47.466 --> 01:49.268
break two kids up
during a loogie fight?

01:49.302 --> 01:51.404
It's way worse than any Krill
battle you've ever been in.

01:51.437 --> 01:52.738
I did not imply in any way

01:52.772 --> 01:54.273
that my job
was more important than yours.

01:54.307 --> 01:55.741
You've said little things
in the past

01:55.775 --> 01:57.110
without even realizing it.

01:57.143 --> 01:59.112
Well, I apologize if I have,

01:59.145 --> 02:00.880
but I don't think that at all.

02:00.914 --> 02:03.049
I have a lot of respect
for what you do.

02:03.082 --> 02:04.951
It's just not what you
and your ex-husband do.

02:04.984 --> 02:07.620
What? What does Ed
have to do with this?

02:09.622 --> 02:11.791
(exhales) Okay, look,
forget I brought it up.

02:11.825 --> 02:14.794
Let's just take that trip, huh?
We need it.

02:17.931 --> 02:20.900
Cassius, I...

02:20.934 --> 02:22.735
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.637
Oh, come on,
don't overreact to this.

02:24.670 --> 02:25.905
I'm not.

02:25.939 --> 02:28.641
I just feel like
we want different things.

02:28.674 --> 02:31.410
You want a marriage,
a family, me working less.

02:31.444 --> 02:33.746
And I get that, I really do.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.915
It's just not what I want.

02:35.949 --> 02:38.617
-(comm chimes)
-ED: Mercer to Grayson.

02:39.853 --> 02:41.420
Go ahead.

02:41.454 --> 02:43.589
ED:
We're approaching Moclus.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.624
On my way.

02:45.658 --> 02:46.792
I have to go.

02:46.826 --> 02:48.661
Can we talk about this later?

02:48.694 --> 02:51.264
(sighs)
I don't want to lead you on.

02:51.297 --> 02:52.798
It's not fair to you.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.302
I'm just...

02:56.335 --> 02:58.271
I can't see you.

02:58.304 --> 03:00.139
I'm sorry.

03:12.185 --> 03:14.153
*

03:36.342 --> 03:38.711
ED:
Captain Rechik,
welcome to the Orville.

03:38.744 --> 03:40.313
We're looking forward
to meeting your engineer.

03:40.346 --> 03:41.814
And we want to thank you

03:41.847 --> 03:43.316
for loaning him to us
for this upgrade.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.051
No thanks are necessary.

03:45.084 --> 03:47.887
He is gathering his equipment
and can begin work immediately.

03:55.761 --> 03:57.063
Locar.

03:58.764 --> 04:00.533
It is good to see you again.

04:00.566 --> 04:02.735
If you are ready
to begin the upgrade,

04:02.768 --> 04:04.703
Lieutenant Keyali
will show you to engineering.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.540
I will be there shortly.

04:07.573 --> 04:09.608
After you.

04:12.278 --> 04:15.748
Locar is one of the finest
engineers on Moclus.

04:15.781 --> 04:17.050
You are fortunate.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.551
We feel lucky to have him.

04:18.584 --> 04:21.754
If you will excuse me,
I must return to my vessel

04:21.787 --> 04:23.422
to make preparations
for the test.

04:23.456 --> 04:25.058
Let us know
if there's anything you need.

04:27.293 --> 04:29.262
Bortus.

04:30.796 --> 04:32.431
How do you know that guy?

04:32.465 --> 04:35.268
He was once my kodashik.

04:36.435 --> 04:39.905
What you would call
an "old boyfriend."

04:49.582 --> 04:51.584
*

05:20.779 --> 05:22.781
*

05:54.880 --> 05:56.882
*

06:02.721 --> 06:04.957
We must reconfigure
the deflector core

06:04.990 --> 06:08.861
to accommodate the addition of
a fifth graviton generator here.

06:08.894 --> 06:11.997
Regulations say the core
can only handle four generators.

06:12.031 --> 06:14.700
Yes. I helped write
those regulations.

06:14.733 --> 06:18.171
Well, all right, then.
Let's get to it.

06:19.738 --> 06:22.508
If everything is satisfactory,

06:22.541 --> 06:24.143
I will leave you to your work.

06:24.177 --> 06:26.712
The engineering staff
appears quite competent.

06:26.745 --> 06:29.382
I hope, while I am here,

06:29.415 --> 06:31.817
that you and I will have
a chance to talk.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.652
It is unlikely.

06:33.686 --> 06:35.354
I have many responsibilities.

06:35.388 --> 06:36.589
You will excuse me.

06:40.593 --> 06:43.496
Well, like he said,
I'm around if you need anything.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.164
I will require assistance

06:45.198 --> 06:48.067
with your security interfaces
during the upgrade.

06:48.101 --> 06:50.736
Yeah, we thought you might.
I'll be down here for the test

06:50.769 --> 06:51.870
so you don't hit any firewalls.

06:51.904 --> 06:53.539
Very well.

06:53.572 --> 06:56.209
Sounds like you're
a pretty big deal back home.

06:56.242 --> 06:57.710
Yes.

06:57.743 --> 07:00.679
(chuckles) Okay.
I like the honesty.

07:00.713 --> 07:03.082
By the way, I think we got
your food synthesizer

07:03.116 --> 07:04.583
all set up for Moclan cuisine,

07:04.617 --> 07:06.352
but let me know
if we missed anything.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.721
I once saw Bortus
eat a fork on a dare,

07:08.754 --> 07:10.523
so I'm ready for any request.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.591
I am sure it is sufficient.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.562
I'll see you in the morning.

07:25.804 --> 07:27.806
*

07:35.080 --> 07:38.717
So... did you see Locar today?

07:38.751 --> 07:40.453
I did.

07:40.486 --> 07:42.054
And what did you talk about?

07:42.087 --> 07:44.723
We discussed his mission.

07:44.757 --> 07:46.625
Is that all?

07:46.659 --> 07:47.793
Yes.

07:47.826 --> 07:48.827
Who's Locar?

07:51.096 --> 07:53.732
He is a Moclan engineer.

07:53.766 --> 07:57.470
-Who once had a relationship
with Bortus.
-Klyden.

07:57.503 --> 08:00.573
There is no reason
to hide anything from Topa.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.241
Or from each other.

08:02.275 --> 08:03.742
I am not hiding anything.

08:03.776 --> 08:05.611
It ended many years ago.

08:05.644 --> 08:07.280
What is a relationship?

08:07.313 --> 08:10.583
It is what comes
before the egg.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.185
(door chimes)

08:19.792 --> 08:21.260
Locar.

08:21.294 --> 08:23.296
I hope I am not disturbing you.

08:23.329 --> 08:24.930
What do you want?

08:24.963 --> 08:29.101
Bortus, do not be rude.
Come in.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.837
I am Klyden, Bortus's mate.

08:31.870 --> 08:33.506
It is good to meet you.

08:33.539 --> 08:35.841
Perhaps you would like
to join us for dinner.

08:35.874 --> 08:37.776
That is not convenient.

08:37.810 --> 08:40.513
Nonsense. Sit down.

08:40.546 --> 08:42.215
Thank you.

08:45.651 --> 08:48.354
This is our son, Topa.

08:48.387 --> 08:50.122
Hello, Topa.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.291
Did you and my papa make an egg?

08:52.325 --> 08:53.792
We did not.

08:53.826 --> 08:56.795
You are my only egg, Topa.

08:56.829 --> 08:59.131
Do you have a mate
of your own, Locar?

08:59.164 --> 09:02.801
I do not.
My work demands much of my time.

09:02.835 --> 09:05.671
It must be very difficult.

09:09.675 --> 09:13.979
I want you to know that I will
do my best on the upgrade.

09:14.012 --> 09:17.383
And I hope
that we may be friends.

09:17.416 --> 09:18.684
(coughs)

09:24.857 --> 09:26.859
*

09:32.398 --> 09:34.199
We're ready
when you are, Commander.

09:34.233 --> 09:36.369
Just another
few minutes, Captain.

09:36.402 --> 09:38.537
Emitter levels are stable. Good.

09:38.571 --> 09:40.506
Hey, guys, I brought us
some good-luck cupcakes.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.040
Oh, my God, Jenny,
those look amazing.

09:42.074 --> 09:44.710
Yeah, see, look, they have
little Orvilles on them.

09:44.743 --> 09:47.012
Uh-oh.
Tractor beam activated.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.582
It's pulling us in.
Oh, no!

09:49.615 --> 09:51.584
The field strength is up
over 60%.

09:51.617 --> 09:53.018
What's the phase differential?

09:53.051 --> 09:54.387
.40 radians.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.689
Well within operational limits.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.557
-Locar, cupcake?
-No.

09:58.591 --> 10:01.026
-You sure?
-I have given you my answer.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.595
Okay.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.566
Your ex seems like
a pretty nice guy, Bortus.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.568
(groans)

10:09.602 --> 10:12.237
May I ask why
you terminated your coupling?

10:12.271 --> 10:14.373
We were incompatible.

10:14.407 --> 10:16.942
When Moclans break up, is there,
like, all that stabbing,

10:16.975 --> 10:18.577
like with the divorce?

10:18.611 --> 10:20.713
No. Each Moclan extracts a tooth

10:20.746 --> 10:22.548
and leaves it
with his former mate.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.883
Yeah. I knew it had to be
something like that.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.385
Do you still have the tooth?

10:26.419 --> 10:28.754
No. It is given
to the next mate.

10:28.787 --> 10:30.723
Uh, let me guess.
He eats it.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.892
-That is correct.
-Yes! Man, I'm getting
so good at this.

10:33.926 --> 10:37.062
-(comm beeps)
-JOHN: Lamarr to bridge.
We're good to go down here.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.231
All right. Lieutenant,
hail the Moclan ship.

10:39.264 --> 10:43.235
Captain Rechik, we're ready
to begin the deflector test.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.571
Very well, Captain.
We are ready.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.239
Bridge to engineering.

10:47.272 --> 10:50.776
-Raise deflectors.
-Aye, sir. Deflectors up.

10:50.809 --> 10:52.578
Look.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.580
JOHN:
Damn.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.582
I've never seen
the field output that high.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.584
I told you it would work.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.419
Nice going.

11:00.453 --> 11:01.987
JOHN:
We'll see.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.756
Ensign, reconfigure the buffers
to compensate

11:03.789 --> 11:05.791
-for the higher output.
-Aye, sir.

11:05.824 --> 11:08.794
-All right, Captain.
Let 'er rip.
-Acknowledged.

11:08.827 --> 11:11.830
Lieutenant Malloy, begin
standard evasive maneuvers.

11:11.864 --> 11:13.265
Aye, sir.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.300
*

11:32.885 --> 11:34.453
Malloy, don't be cocky.

11:34.487 --> 11:36.121
They have to hit us
for the test to work.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.890
Yes, sir.
Dumbing it down.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.536
-Deflectors down to 94%.
-Not bad.

11:50.569 --> 11:53.672
Mercer to Rechik.
Give us a little more.

11:53.706 --> 11:55.173
With pleasure, Captain.

11:59.845 --> 12:02.147
Recalibrating.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.982
Security protocols have engaged.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.217
I got you. Don't worry.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.820
All clear.

12:07.853 --> 12:10.022
LOCAR (over comm):
Deflectors at 86%.

12:14.593 --> 12:16.695
*

12:18.697 --> 12:20.499
That was a torpedo.

12:20.533 --> 12:24.002
Hey, guys, no torpedoes, okay?
We said no torpedoes.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.738
RECHIK (over comm):
My apologies, Captain.

12:25.771 --> 12:26.905
We said no torpedoes, right?

12:26.939 --> 12:28.006
I was right there
when we said it.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.041
You were right there.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.082
Uh, hang on.

12:37.115 --> 12:39.685
The starboard emitter array
is losing power. It's buckling.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.420
It will reset automatically.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.690
It's dropping fast.

12:44.723 --> 12:47.225
Yaphit, reroute auxiliary power
to the starboard array.

12:47.259 --> 12:49.061
Doing it now.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.897
(sighs) It's still dropping.

12:51.930 --> 12:53.566
I'm gonna tell the bridge
to abort.

12:53.599 --> 12:54.700
No! It will reset.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.570
Locar, we got 300 people
on this ship.

12:57.603 --> 12:59.772
We're not gonna blow 'em up
over some test.

12:59.805 --> 13:01.206
Bridge, initiate shutdown.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.442
Wait. Stop. Look.

13:03.476 --> 13:05.611
-KELLY: Lamarr, what is it?
-Stand by.

13:09.615 --> 13:10.883
Well, I'll be damned.

13:10.916 --> 13:14.086
The emitters have reset.

13:14.119 --> 13:16.054
Engineering to bridge.

13:16.088 --> 13:18.957
I think we can officially call
the deflector upgrade

13:18.991 --> 13:20.993
a big success.

13:22.294 --> 13:25.731
I believe I will try a cupcake.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.000
(laughs)

13:42.481 --> 13:45.117
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.286
Hey. Any updates
on the deflector...

13:48.320 --> 13:49.622
What is that?

13:49.655 --> 13:52.625
It's a cookie bouquet...
from Cassius.

13:52.658 --> 13:55.628
Is it, like, an anniversary
or something?

13:55.661 --> 13:58.430
No, I, uh...
I broke up with him.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.632
Oh, no.

13:59.665 --> 14:01.934
Wow, that was really convincing.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.602
Uh, sorry,
I didn't mean that to...

14:03.636 --> 14:05.137
It's okay, you don't have
to pretend to be sad.

14:05.170 --> 14:08.340
Uh, no, I-I really am genuinely
sorry, Kel. That sucks.

14:08.373 --> 14:09.675
Are you okay?

14:09.708 --> 14:11.777
I'm fine. It's...

14:11.810 --> 14:13.512
It's been coming for a while.

14:13.546 --> 14:15.280
May I?

14:15.313 --> 14:17.449
Go ahead.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.984
Hmm.

14:20.152 --> 14:22.120
You know, I may be biased here,

14:22.154 --> 14:24.289
but I think you made
the right call.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.024
I mean, if you guys wanted
to get married,

14:26.058 --> 14:27.359
that would've been awkward
because,

14:27.392 --> 14:28.961
as captain of the ship,
I would've had

14:28.994 --> 14:30.495
to perform the ceremony.

14:30.529 --> 14:32.297
Yeah, I'm really tired of people

14:32.330 --> 14:33.799
talking about me
getting married.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.168
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

14:37.736 --> 14:39.838
Sir, we have an update
on the modifications.

14:39.872 --> 14:41.173
Excellent. What is it?

14:41.206 --> 14:42.841
Locar and Chief Lamarr
are prepared

14:42.875 --> 14:44.677
to finalize the upgrade
on your order.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.812
It will take
approximately 48 hours.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.547
That's great. Tell them
they can start right away.

14:48.581 --> 14:50.883
Aye, sir.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.687
Wow, these are actually
really good.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.555
-Take it.
-Seriously?

14:56.589 --> 14:58.356
Yeah.

15:10.603 --> 15:12.905
Hello.

15:12.938 --> 15:15.007
Locar.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.009
What are you doing
in my quarters?

15:17.042 --> 15:19.712
I must speak with you.

15:32.424 --> 15:35.193
Look, I don't know how
they do things on Moclan ships,

15:35.227 --> 15:36.695
but we don't just barge

15:36.729 --> 15:38.731
into someone's quarters
without asking.

15:38.764 --> 15:41.399
I am very sorry to intrude
on your privacy,

15:41.433 --> 15:44.737
but what I have to say
cannot be said in public.

15:44.770 --> 15:46.404
What is it?

15:46.438 --> 15:50.208
It is... not easy.

15:50.242 --> 15:52.711
Lieutenant...

15:52.745 --> 15:55.280
I am attracted to you.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.383
Okay.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.053
I have made you uncomfortable.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.555
No, just...

16:03.588 --> 16:07.059
confused more than
uncomfortable.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.894
I thought...

16:08.927 --> 16:12.130
I mean, Moclans
are an all-male species.

16:13.465 --> 16:16.568
There are some... like me...

16:16.601 --> 16:19.271
who are drawn to females.

16:21.306 --> 16:23.608
It is forbidden
to express these feelings.

16:23.642 --> 16:26.745
To be found out would mean
a lifetime of imprisonment.

16:26.779 --> 16:28.814
Have you ever told anyone?

16:28.847 --> 16:31.083
Only a very few.

16:31.116 --> 16:34.753
And only if...

16:34.787 --> 16:38.456
if I believe the feelings
are reciprocated.

16:39.792 --> 16:43.128
Locar, I don't even know you.

16:43.161 --> 16:44.596
I mean, we just met.

16:44.629 --> 16:47.265
I am a fool.
Please forgive me.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.834
Well, no, you're not a...

16:48.867 --> 16:51.136
It's just...

16:51.169 --> 16:53.505
This is a lot to lay on someone.

16:53.538 --> 16:54.840
That's all.

16:56.809 --> 16:59.044
Good night, Lieutenant.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.981
(door whooshes shut)

17:06.151 --> 17:08.153
(exhales)

17:10.022 --> 17:12.124
He's sending messages to my comm
literally by the hour.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.491
It's out of control.

17:13.525 --> 17:14.793
Ugh, that's got to be
so frustrating.

17:14.827 --> 17:16.528
-What do they say?
-He wants to talk.

17:16.561 --> 17:17.662
But there's nothing
to talk about.

17:17.696 --> 17:19.464
Well, you just got
to stay strong.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.466
-He says he wants closure.
-Yeah, right.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.201
-He doesn't want closure.
-No. No, see, that's something

17:23.235 --> 17:24.970
guys say when they want
to get you in a room

17:25.003 --> 17:26.638
so they can try and talk you
into getting back together.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.541
Exactly, and in my mind,
you know, I'm-I'm just done.

17:29.574 --> 17:30.709
-I'm out.
-Yeah.

17:30.743 --> 17:31.977
But the messages keep coming.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.645
And I'm like, "Enough,"
you know.

17:33.678 --> 17:34.980
"I-I feel horrible
that you're upset,

17:35.013 --> 17:36.715
but I have to move on."

17:36.749 --> 17:39.551
Ugh. God, men are the worst.
I'm angry just hearing that.

17:39.584 --> 17:42.054
-(comm chimes)
-Oh, look, here's another one.

17:42.087 --> 17:44.656
"The day I met you
was the day time began."

17:44.689 --> 17:49.361
Oof. Yeah, definitely
do not respond. Mm-mm.

17:49.394 --> 17:51.329
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

17:51.363 --> 17:52.697
No, it's all good.

17:52.731 --> 17:55.200
We were just checking out
the Ed-Kelly show.

17:55.233 --> 17:57.569
JOHN:
Yeah. Word is
she and Cassius are done.

17:57.602 --> 17:59.337
Oh, wow. How'd he take it?

17:59.371 --> 18:01.339
Oh, apparently, not so good.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.408
You know, there's something
seriously wrong with all of us

18:03.441 --> 18:05.177
when the most stable
relationship on the Orville

18:05.210 --> 18:06.678
is Isaac's.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.414
Yeah, man, what's your secret?

18:09.447 --> 18:11.083
Dr. Finn has cautioned me
against speaking

18:11.116 --> 18:12.684
too openly about our coupling.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.020
-Did something happen?
-GORDON: Oh, yeah.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.755
He was going around the ship
asking everybody

18:16.789 --> 18:19.024
what sexual positions
are most pleasurable

18:19.057 --> 18:20.692
to biological life-forms.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.428
I was merely attempting
to provide Dr. Finn

18:23.461 --> 18:26.198
with the most dutifully
calibrated coital experience.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.533
Yeah, no, that's what
women want: dutiful coitus.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.602
Hey. I'm trying to eat here.

18:30.635 --> 18:33.705
-Why don't they just
get back together?
-(scoffs) Good luck.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.407
I mean, I know I haven't
been here that long,

18:35.440 --> 18:36.541
but look at them. (laughs)

18:36.574 --> 18:39.945
You can tell they still
love each other.

18:39.978 --> 18:43.048
It's... very complicated
with those two.

18:43.081 --> 18:46.551
I guess, but I don't know.

18:46.584 --> 18:49.554
The galaxy is full
of so many unhappy people.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.924
Why ignore something good?

19:07.840 --> 19:09.741
Hi.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.576
Hello.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.478
How's the upgrade coming?

19:13.511 --> 19:16.748
It will be completed
within 12 hours.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.650
Great.

19:18.683 --> 19:21.753
How did you know I was here?

19:21.786 --> 19:24.789
I'm chief of security.
I know where everybody is.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.129
Will you go back to Moclus
after you're done?

19:31.163 --> 19:33.298
Yes.

19:33.331 --> 19:35.500
It's got to be hard...

19:35.533 --> 19:38.636
living there...
feeling the way you do.

19:41.974 --> 19:46.511
For a long time,
I had no one to tell.

19:46.544 --> 19:48.280
I tried to hide it,

19:48.313 --> 19:53.118
not only from others
but from myself.

19:53.151 --> 19:56.621
Had I not left Moclus,
that would still be so.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.692
I'm assuming...
your family doesn't know.

20:00.725 --> 20:03.962
The shame would be theirs
as well.

20:03.996 --> 20:05.964
They would be ruined.

20:05.998 --> 20:08.500
Tough crowd on your planet.

20:08.533 --> 20:14.072
On Moclus, mediocrity is the
only behavior above suspicion.

20:15.373 --> 20:16.841
For you...

20:16.875 --> 20:20.178
it must also be...

20:20.212 --> 20:22.147
difficult.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.883
A Xelayan serving
in the military?

20:24.917 --> 20:27.052
It's a little different.

20:27.085 --> 20:29.721
I come from a long line
of Xelayans who served.

20:29.754 --> 20:31.656
My family's a bunch
of black sheep.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.759
But on this ship, you are alone.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.498
Want to go for a walk?

20:40.532 --> 20:42.901
If we are seen...

20:42.935 --> 20:44.536
We won't be.

20:44.569 --> 20:46.771
We'll be on Earth.

21:06.058 --> 21:08.626
(swing music plays)

21:12.230 --> 21:14.232
(car motor rumbling)

21:17.569 --> 21:19.904
LOCAR:
What is this place?

21:19.938 --> 21:22.740
It's a historical program
Commander Grayson showed me.

21:22.774 --> 21:26.578
New York City, 1945.

21:26.611 --> 21:29.047
What is its purpose?

21:29.081 --> 21:31.783
Recreation. Some of the humans
use these programs

21:31.816 --> 21:34.752
to stay connected
to their home planet.

21:35.954 --> 21:37.922
Who are you?

21:37.956 --> 21:39.724
I am Locar.

21:39.757 --> 21:40.792
What's wrong with your head?

21:40.825 --> 21:43.461
-I am a Moclan.
-Oh.

21:43.495 --> 21:46.064
This is Betty.
I got her for Christmas.

21:46.098 --> 21:47.599
That is not my concern.

21:47.632 --> 21:50.568
-MOTHER: Elizabeth!
-Coming, Mommy!

21:50.602 --> 21:51.569
Bye.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.238
(laughs)

21:53.271 --> 21:56.574
Bye. Strange program.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.577
Commander Grayson says
it makes her feel less isolated.

21:59.611 --> 22:02.247
You come in here, you hang
with some friendly people,

22:02.280 --> 22:04.316
you lose yourself
in another time...

22:04.349 --> 22:06.451
you almost forget
you're in space.

22:06.484 --> 22:08.786
(laughter nearby)

22:13.291 --> 22:14.926
What are they doing?

22:14.959 --> 22:17.495
TALLA:
Dancing.

22:17.529 --> 22:19.264
That is dancing?

22:19.297 --> 22:21.933
Yeah. Why?
What's dancing like on Moclus?

22:21.966 --> 22:26.004
It is much less... restrained.

22:26.038 --> 22:28.706
Here, let me show you.

22:29.974 --> 22:33.445
I used to date a human,
believe it or not.

22:33.478 --> 22:36.848
Just go with the music
and move your feet slowly.

22:36.881 --> 22:41.286
Step toward me... step back...

22:41.319 --> 22:43.621
side, together.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.990
(laughs) Try again.

22:46.024 --> 22:48.793
-Toward me... back.
-* There'll be bluebirds

22:48.826 --> 22:51.796
-Side... together.
-* Over...

22:51.829 --> 22:53.665
It is very uneventful.

22:53.698 --> 22:55.900
Okay, give me your hand.

22:57.669 --> 23:00.872
Now wrap your arm
around my back.

23:00.905 --> 23:02.540
There you go.

23:02.574 --> 23:05.377
It's about subtlety.

23:05.410 --> 23:09.147
Little nonverbal moves
your partner responds to.

23:09.181 --> 23:10.648
Try leading.

23:10.682 --> 23:12.984
"Leading"?

23:13.017 --> 23:16.688
Use physical communication to
tell me how you want me to move.

23:16.721 --> 23:20.158
* Tomorrow

23:20.192 --> 23:22.827
* When the world is free

23:22.860 --> 23:25.997
*

23:26.030 --> 23:28.666
Was I wrong to do that?

23:28.700 --> 23:31.569
* The shepherd will tend
his sheep *

23:31.603 --> 23:36.708
* The valley will bloom again

23:36.741 --> 23:40.378
* And Johnny will go
to sleep... *

23:40.412 --> 23:42.680
KELLY (over comm):
Grayson to Keyali.

23:42.714 --> 23:44.382
Keyali here. Go ahead.

23:44.416 --> 23:46.718
Can you come
to my quarters, please?

23:46.751 --> 23:48.019
Uh, yes.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.921
I'm on my way.

23:50.955 --> 23:52.190
I'll be back.

23:52.224 --> 23:53.858
Enjoy the city.

23:53.891 --> 23:56.528
* The White Cliffs of Dover

23:56.561 --> 23:59.564
* Tomorrow

23:59.597 --> 24:04.068
* Just you wait and see.

24:04.102 --> 24:06.638
*

24:23.321 --> 24:25.757
(door whooshes open)

24:31.095 --> 24:33.097
(song ends)

24:34.132 --> 24:37.602
I know what you are.

24:52.684 --> 24:54.085
Hey. What's up?

24:54.118 --> 24:56.421
Can you please do
something about this?

24:56.454 --> 24:57.822
Oh, my God.

24:57.855 --> 25:00.758
(laughs):
Hey, hey! It's a party, man.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.594
Let's keep it going,
fill the room.

25:02.627 --> 25:03.928
Cassius sent it over.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.663
What's this "it" crap, man?

25:05.697 --> 25:06.664
It's a he.

25:06.698 --> 25:07.932
Sorry. He.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.501
It's a Katrudian.

25:09.534 --> 25:11.603
I know. How did he
get him on board?

25:11.636 --> 25:12.770
There was a Katrudian
who came in

25:12.804 --> 25:14.506
with the botanical team
the other day.

25:14.539 --> 25:16.674
Clearance checked out.
Must've been this guy.

25:16.708 --> 25:18.843
Yeah, Cassius and I go way back.

25:18.876 --> 25:21.613
My kids were in his
biohistory class on Antares Two.

25:21.646 --> 25:24.682
I owed him a couple of favors.
Surprise!

25:24.716 --> 25:26.451
-Okay, this has to stop.
-Come on, Kelly,

25:26.484 --> 25:27.819
he wants you back.

25:27.852 --> 25:29.687
Stop being such a dum-dum

25:29.721 --> 25:31.623
and just give him
another chance.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.491
Dude, I don't know you,
and my personal life

25:33.525 --> 25:35.293
is none of your business.

25:35.327 --> 25:37.529
-Talla, will you please
get him out of here?
-Will do.

25:37.562 --> 25:39.797
By the way, no offense, but...

25:39.831 --> 25:42.334
(whispers):
fire your decorator.

25:47.739 --> 25:50.508
Sorry, that took longer
than I thought.

25:54.078 --> 25:57.014
Locar?

25:59.016 --> 26:01.986
What is the location
of engineer Locar?

26:02.019 --> 26:03.988
COMPUTER:
Engineer Locar

26:04.021 --> 26:06.190
-is not aboard the Orville.
-Did he take a shuttle

26:06.224 --> 26:08.726
-back to his own ship?
-There is no record

26:08.760 --> 26:11.195
of a shuttle departure.

26:11.229 --> 26:13.231
Access playback
for current program

26:13.265 --> 26:16.534
beginning at time index 1701.7.

26:16.568 --> 26:18.670
Security code Keyali-alpha-3-0.

26:18.703 --> 26:20.505
Commencing playback.

26:20.538 --> 26:25.243
* There'll be bluebirds over

26:26.544 --> 26:28.680
* The White Cliffs

26:28.713 --> 26:30.214
-(door whooshes open)
-* Of Dover

26:31.616 --> 26:35.052
(buzzing, crackling)

26:36.621 --> 26:38.923
(distorted):
I know what you are.

26:38.956 --> 26:41.693
Identify the individual
in the doorway.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.561
COMPUTER:
Unable to resolve distortion.

26:43.595 --> 26:45.597
The file is corrupted.

26:57.775 --> 26:59.777
*

27:03.748 --> 27:05.917
(distorted):
I know what you are.

27:08.820 --> 27:11.623
How was the killer able
to shut off the safeties

27:11.656 --> 27:13.057
in the simulator?

27:13.090 --> 27:15.593
We do not know.
However, we have determined

27:15.627 --> 27:18.229
that the weapon used
was also simulated.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.631
It's the perfect murder.

27:19.664 --> 27:21.599
A holographic weapon
that vaporizes its target

27:21.633 --> 27:24.235
and then vanishes.
And no body.

27:24.268 --> 27:25.570
TALLA:
It doesn't make any sense.

27:25.603 --> 27:27.104
Who would want to kill him?

27:27.138 --> 27:29.273
Isaac and I are trying
to clean up the image.

27:29.307 --> 27:31.743
Locar was highly regarded
on my ship.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.479
-It must have been
one of your crew.
-Oh, now, hang on a second.

27:34.512 --> 27:35.913
Before we start making
accusations,

27:35.947 --> 27:37.281
let's get the facts.

27:37.315 --> 27:38.650
Bortus, you knew him.
Did he have

27:38.683 --> 27:40.518
any enemies
that you can think of?

27:41.619 --> 27:43.421
No. I can think of no one

27:43.455 --> 27:45.256
who thought ill of him.

27:45.289 --> 27:47.091
Were there any problems
with the engineering staff?

27:47.124 --> 27:48.760
Anyone he rubbed the wrong way?

27:48.793 --> 27:50.294
-Not that I saw.
-What was he doing

27:50.328 --> 27:51.663
in the simulator
in the first place?

27:53.164 --> 27:55.600
(clears throat softly)
I took him there.

27:55.633 --> 27:56.968
What for?

27:58.536 --> 28:01.639
Locar expressed
a desire to see me.

28:01.673 --> 28:03.508
Romantically.

28:03.541 --> 28:04.942
What?

28:04.976 --> 28:06.478
That is preposterous!

28:06.511 --> 28:07.679
You are a female!

28:07.712 --> 28:10.448
Why would he wish
to mate with you?

28:10.482 --> 28:13.618
He was... attracted to women.

28:13.651 --> 28:14.786
RECHIK:
Captain, I will not sit here

28:14.819 --> 28:16.854
and listen to these lies.

28:16.888 --> 28:17.989
It's the truth.

28:18.022 --> 28:20.825
Did you... reciprocate?

28:21.559 --> 28:23.127
(sighs)

28:23.160 --> 28:24.796
What did you do to him?

28:24.829 --> 28:27.632
-What do you mean, "do to him"?
-Captain Rechik...

28:27.665 --> 28:28.966
He would not have engaged

28:29.000 --> 28:30.535
in such deviant behavior
on his own!

28:30.568 --> 28:33.337
The only thing I did
was accept him for who he was.

28:33.371 --> 28:35.373
-Another lie!
-Captain, if you'll
take your seat...

28:35.407 --> 28:36.974
If you people weren't such
a bunch of closed-minded,

28:37.008 --> 28:38.376
-bigoted pieces...
-That's enough!

28:38.410 --> 28:39.744
-Commander, they...
-Lieutenant!

28:41.012 --> 28:42.346
Wait in my office.

28:42.380 --> 28:43.681
That's an order.

28:52.424 --> 28:54.559
Captain, my apologies.

28:54.592 --> 28:57.194
I promise you
we will find whoever did this.

28:57.228 --> 29:00.398
Let us hope the killer
is brought to justice.

29:05.437 --> 29:06.871
(door whooshes shut)

29:17.114 --> 29:19.717
*

29:19.751 --> 29:21.519
Look, I understand
he confided in you,

29:21.553 --> 29:23.855
but if you were gonna pursue
a relationship with this guy,

29:23.888 --> 29:25.523
you might have given us
a heads-up.

29:25.557 --> 29:27.191
Captain, with all due respect,

29:27.224 --> 29:29.427
my personal life is
no one's business but my own.

29:29.461 --> 29:32.263
Except when it affects the
smooth operation of this ship.

29:32.296 --> 29:33.865
ED:
Look, nobody's saying
this isn't messed up,

29:33.898 --> 29:36.400
and we're not trying to go
all HR on you here.

29:36.434 --> 29:38.369
We're just saying
you should have told us,

29:38.402 --> 29:40.938
so that we could have helped
prepare you and this ship

29:40.972 --> 29:42.406
for any fallout.

29:43.808 --> 29:46.210
I'm sorry if I caused
a problem, sir.

29:46.243 --> 29:47.945
Now let me fix it.

29:47.979 --> 29:49.747
I can find the murderer.

29:51.282 --> 29:53.785
I'm thinking I should put
someone else in charge.

29:53.818 --> 29:55.286
Why?

29:55.319 --> 29:57.221
Your personal involvement
with Locar...

29:57.254 --> 29:59.390
Will in no way affect
my job performance.

29:59.423 --> 30:01.593
Nobody gets away with murder
on my watch.

30:01.626 --> 30:03.728
All right.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.664
I'll hold you to that.
Dismissed.

30:07.965 --> 30:10.267
*

30:19.511 --> 30:21.579
Excuse me? Commander?

30:21.613 --> 30:23.247
You have a minute?

30:23.280 --> 30:25.416
What do you want?

30:25.449 --> 30:27.084
I just wanted to make sure

30:27.118 --> 30:30.755
that there wasn't
any awkwardness between us.

30:30.788 --> 30:33.090
I mean,
we work closely together.

30:33.124 --> 30:35.426
You have been a selfish fool.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.094
How?

30:37.128 --> 30:39.597
You encouraged
a dangerous impulse.

30:39.631 --> 30:41.599
I didn't make him do anything.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.467
He came to me.

30:46.203 --> 30:47.639
(Bortus sighs)

30:48.640 --> 30:50.474
Did you know?

30:51.976 --> 30:55.446
You do not understand
the Moclan way.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.182
To you, he was a...

30:58.215 --> 30:59.951
curiosity.

30:59.984 --> 31:02.520
That's a load of crap, Bortus.

31:02.554 --> 31:04.021
I felt something for him.

31:04.055 --> 31:06.057
Was what you felt
worth his death?

31:07.725 --> 31:10.127
You know, you're right.

31:10.161 --> 31:12.163
I don't understand
the Moclan way.

31:12.196 --> 31:14.298
I don't understand
a screwed-up culture

31:14.331 --> 31:16.167
that keeps people
from being who they are

31:16.200 --> 31:18.035
under threat of personal ruin.

31:18.069 --> 31:20.805
That will be all, Lieutenant.

31:20.838 --> 31:24.141
I thought you'd be more evolved.

31:24.175 --> 31:26.711
Especially given what
they did to your daughter.

31:26.744 --> 31:28.145
I said...!

31:28.179 --> 31:31.583
That will be all.

31:33.184 --> 31:35.519
*

31:40.725 --> 31:42.560
(sighs)

31:45.196 --> 31:48.566
The distortion is integrated
into the playback layers,

31:48.600 --> 31:50.534
but I cannot determine
which one.

31:50.568 --> 31:53.070
Hmm. What if we
rebuild the image,

31:53.104 --> 31:54.672
add a layer at a time?

31:54.706 --> 31:57.575
There is a danger that it
could delete the source data.

31:57.609 --> 32:00.077
However, if you wish,
I will attempt it.

32:00.111 --> 32:02.546
What the hell?
Might as well roll the dice.

32:02.580 --> 32:03.715
We're stumped, anyway.

32:05.249 --> 32:07.619
(beeping, whirring, clicking)

32:09.721 --> 32:12.523
I have found the layer
containing the distortion.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.558
I will stabilize it.

32:21.766 --> 32:24.035
(buzzing, crackling)

32:24.068 --> 32:27.404
*

32:34.779 --> 32:36.981
Oh, my God.

32:47.091 --> 32:49.093
*

32:50.762 --> 32:53.765
I did not kill Locar.
I swear it.

32:53.798 --> 32:55.399
But you were in the simulator.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.601
-Yes.
-Why were you there?

32:57.635 --> 32:59.403
I followed you.

32:59.436 --> 33:02.406
I could see what was happening.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.608
I told him I would not be silent

33:04.642 --> 33:06.911
while he debased
our way of life.

33:06.944 --> 33:10.114
-But then I left.
-You said all this,

33:10.147 --> 33:12.784
-but you didn't kill him?
-That is correct.

33:12.817 --> 33:14.085
Well, then what
were you gonna do?

33:14.118 --> 33:15.586
I was going to turn him in

33:15.619 --> 33:18.322
to the authorities on Moclus.

33:24.662 --> 33:28.099
Bortus, you don't have to stay
if this is too painful.

33:28.132 --> 33:30.334
My duty comes first, Captain.

33:30.367 --> 33:32.503
All right.
So, what do you think?

33:32.536 --> 33:34.271
Records show that Klyden
has some training

33:34.305 --> 33:36.173
in the fundamentals
of engineering. Not a lot,

33:36.207 --> 33:37.608
but he could have masked
the playback

33:37.641 --> 33:38.810
if he'd done his homework.

33:38.843 --> 33:41.112
He had the means, motive,
and opportunity.

33:41.145 --> 33:43.614
And he has a prior history
of violence on this ship.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.116
Sorry, Bortus.

33:45.149 --> 33:46.650
I understand, Commander.

33:48.485 --> 33:49.687
What is it, Talla?

33:49.721 --> 33:52.489
I'd be happier
if he'd confessed.

33:52.523 --> 33:56.127
Well, for now
he's our only suspect.

33:56.160 --> 34:00.364
Captain, may I have a word
with Klyden alone?

34:08.840 --> 34:10.474
Did you kill him?

34:10.507 --> 34:13.010
No. I promise you I did not.

34:13.044 --> 34:14.712
He disgusted you.

34:14.746 --> 34:16.147
Of course!

34:16.180 --> 34:19.550
Any Moclan would be disgusted
by what he is.

34:19.583 --> 34:21.185
Even you.

34:21.218 --> 34:23.554
My thoughts are irrelevant.

34:24.856 --> 34:27.424
However, I believe you.

34:29.393 --> 34:33.164
Topa will be returning home
from school soon.

34:33.197 --> 34:36.000
You should prepare his snack.

34:36.033 --> 34:38.535
Very well.

34:38.569 --> 34:40.738
What should I tell him?

34:40.772 --> 34:43.207
Tell him I love him.

34:44.441 --> 34:47.111
*

34:48.780 --> 34:51.382
(door whooshes open)

34:51.415 --> 34:52.516
(door whooshes shut)

34:52.549 --> 34:54.585
(sighs)

34:54.618 --> 34:57.588
-How are you holding up?
-All I can say is,

34:57.621 --> 35:00.191
thank God the captain kept me
on this investigation.

35:00.224 --> 35:02.259
I haven't had time
to process anything else.

35:02.293 --> 35:04.228
I mean, this has to be
the most insane thing

35:04.261 --> 35:05.729
that's ever happened
on this ship.

35:05.763 --> 35:08.232
One time I almost died
'cause I humped a statue.

35:08.265 --> 35:10.601
-Isaac once cut my leg off.
-The captain and commander,

35:10.634 --> 35:13.871
-they got put in a zoo.
-And Bortus almost crashed
the ship 'cause of porn.

35:13.905 --> 35:15.873
I see.

35:15.907 --> 35:18.075
I don't know, I can't seem
to lock into anyone

35:18.109 --> 35:19.610
on board
who would have a motive.

35:19.643 --> 35:22.546
The only possibility
is Klyden, and...

35:22.579 --> 35:24.548
it smells funny.

35:24.581 --> 35:27.751
He turned off the safeties,
he used a holographic weapon

35:27.785 --> 35:30.221
so there'd be no trace, and he
covered up all the evidence.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.389
So why is he admitting
to being there at all?

35:32.423 --> 35:35.226
You know, there is one thing
that's been bugging me a little.

35:35.259 --> 35:36.760
I wasn't even gonna bring it up.

35:36.794 --> 35:38.129
What is it?

35:38.162 --> 35:40.564
Clearing up the distortion
in the playback,

35:40.597 --> 35:43.267
-it wasn't that hard.
-What do you mean?

35:43.300 --> 35:44.936
Well, there are
a bunch more roadblocks

35:44.969 --> 35:47.604
that could have been there,
but... they weren't.

35:47.638 --> 35:50.908
Well, maybe he didn't have time
or wasn't experienced enough.

35:50.942 --> 35:53.945
I mean, you said his knowledge
of engineering was rudimentary.

35:55.612 --> 35:58.649
Or maybe someone wanted you
to clear it up.

35:58.682 --> 36:00.952
Wanted us to think
Klyden had done it.

36:00.985 --> 36:03.287
Who?

36:03.320 --> 36:05.656
*

36:05.689 --> 36:07.791
(chimes)

36:11.195 --> 36:12.964
Hey.

36:12.997 --> 36:15.599
Sorry to disturb you.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.768
It is all right.

36:17.801 --> 36:21.338
What is the status
of your investigation?

36:21.372 --> 36:23.474
I wish
I had better news for you,

36:23.507 --> 36:26.143
but Klyden
is still the main suspect.

36:27.144 --> 36:29.113
Look, Commander,

36:29.146 --> 36:30.848
I owe you an apology.

36:30.882 --> 36:33.650
You're my superior officer,
and...

36:33.684 --> 36:37.288
I was disrespectful
and insensitive.

36:37.321 --> 36:39.891
And I'm really sorry.

36:41.893 --> 36:44.862
When I was younger,

36:44.896 --> 36:47.899
I served in the Moclan fleet.

36:49.833 --> 36:52.669
Locar and I met
while on the same ship.

36:52.703 --> 36:55.672
The attraction was immediate.

36:55.706 --> 36:57.641
From the day of our gomaskah,

36:57.674 --> 37:01.345
I thought I would be with him
for the rest of my life.

37:01.378 --> 37:02.813
What happened?

37:02.846 --> 37:06.717
Our ship was docked
at Theta Draconis IV.

37:06.750 --> 37:09.720
As I was
the most junior officer,

37:09.753 --> 37:11.222
I stood watch while most

37:11.255 --> 37:12.723
of the crew, including Locar,

37:12.756 --> 37:14.525
took shore leave.

37:14.558 --> 37:16.827
The captain was sympathetic

37:16.860 --> 37:19.030
and took two hours of my watch

37:19.063 --> 37:21.999
so I could visit the planet.

37:22.033 --> 37:26.503
I decided to surprise Locar.

37:26.537 --> 37:30.674
It was there that I found him
with a Thetan woman.

37:30.707 --> 37:33.510
I knew it was wrong, but...

37:33.544 --> 37:34.745
I loved him

37:34.778 --> 37:37.514
and I did not want
to see him destroyed.

37:37.548 --> 37:39.783
So you've known this whole time.

37:41.919 --> 37:45.356
And there's no room
for compassion

37:45.389 --> 37:47.691
or understanding on your planet?

37:47.724 --> 37:50.194
For generations,
my people struggled

37:50.227 --> 37:52.396
to survive on a desolate world.

37:52.429 --> 37:55.032
It was only our culture,
our traditions

37:55.066 --> 37:56.100
that sustained us.

37:56.133 --> 37:58.035
It is who we are.

37:58.069 --> 38:00.537
Man, if I had to live on Moclus,

38:00.571 --> 38:02.706
I'd probably kill myself.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.441
Then you would shame
not only yourself

38:04.475 --> 38:06.110
but your family as well.

38:06.143 --> 38:08.879
All would be banished
from Moclus.

38:08.912 --> 38:13.417
On my world, suicide is
an unforgivable crime.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.722
Commander,

38:18.755 --> 38:21.825
I don't think Locar is dead.

38:35.306 --> 38:38.109
Captain, I believe
what we are looking at

38:38.142 --> 38:39.643
is a simulation.

38:39.676 --> 38:41.245
Th-That's impossible.

38:41.278 --> 38:43.080
The computer verified it
as authentic playback.

38:43.114 --> 38:45.282
We are dealing with one
of the most brilliant engineers

38:45.316 --> 38:46.650
in the Union.

38:46.683 --> 38:49.753
I think he found a way
to fool our computer.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.455
Nobody was murdered here.

38:51.488 --> 38:53.457
Why would Locar go through
all this trouble

38:53.490 --> 38:54.758
to fake his own death?

38:54.791 --> 38:56.260
Because he knew his time was up,

38:56.293 --> 38:58.262
that Klyden was going
to expose him.

38:58.295 --> 38:59.496
His life was over,

38:59.530 --> 39:00.998
and the only way out
he could see

39:01.032 --> 39:02.599
was suicide.

39:02.633 --> 39:03.767
But on Moclus,

39:03.800 --> 39:06.603
suicide means banishment
of all family,

39:06.637 --> 39:09.506
and he didn't want them
to have to pay for his...

39:11.642 --> 39:14.145
...for his sins.

39:14.178 --> 39:16.647
Since Klyden was the one
who was going to ruin him,

39:16.680 --> 39:18.182
he made the perfect scapegoat.

39:18.215 --> 39:20.684
A guilt-free frame job
and a clear conscience.

39:20.717 --> 39:23.487
Right now, all of this
is just speculation.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.655
There's no proof.

39:24.688 --> 39:26.957
Unless Locar turns up alive.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.325
So where is he?

39:28.359 --> 39:29.960
Still somewhere on board
the Orville.

39:29.993 --> 39:31.995
Permission to begin search,
Captain.

39:32.029 --> 39:33.364
Go to it.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.535
Your comscanners
are gonna be useless.

39:38.569 --> 39:40.704
He's already found a way
to mask his biosigns,

39:40.737 --> 39:42.539
so you got your eyes
and that's it.

39:42.573 --> 39:45.542
And, remember, this is one
of the most brilliant engineers

39:45.576 --> 39:47.544
in the Union,
and he doesn't want to be found.

39:47.578 --> 39:48.545
All right?

39:48.579 --> 39:50.881
Let's go.

39:50.914 --> 39:53.384
*

40:20.377 --> 40:23.046
Check the upper corridor
and the launch port.

40:40.397 --> 40:42.399
(soft rustle)

40:46.970 --> 40:49.973
You're here, aren't you?

40:54.745 --> 40:56.547
A personal cloak.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.549
Nothing so complex.

40:58.582 --> 41:01.385
By reducing the field radius,

41:01.418 --> 41:04.788
your shuttle's cloaking device
can be focused like a lens.

41:04.821 --> 41:06.723
What was your plan,

41:06.757 --> 41:09.126
to slip away
at the next outpost?

41:10.594 --> 41:12.563
My brother says,

41:12.596 --> 41:14.798
"No friendship is complete

41:14.831 --> 41:18.602
until your friend
turns to you in despair."

41:18.635 --> 41:21.272
I turn to you now.

41:21.305 --> 41:23.274
Leave me.

41:23.307 --> 41:25.276
Please.

41:27.178 --> 41:29.146
I can't do that.

41:29.180 --> 41:31.248
Then you have betrayed me.

41:31.282 --> 41:33.417
If you knew the truth,

41:33.450 --> 41:37.421
why did you not keep silent
and let me disappear in peace?

41:37.454 --> 41:38.422
I would have.

41:38.455 --> 41:40.090
I want to.

41:40.123 --> 41:42.826
But there's an innocent man
in the brig right now.

41:42.859 --> 41:44.295
Innocent?

41:44.328 --> 41:47.631
His heart is full of hatred,
cowardice.

41:47.664 --> 41:49.633
There is no innocence there.

41:49.666 --> 41:53.604
I can't let him go to prison
for a crime he didn't commit.

41:53.637 --> 41:56.607
But there is another choice.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.775
Request asylum
aboard the Orville.

41:58.809 --> 42:00.811
The captain will grant it.

42:02.145 --> 42:05.616
More hiding.

42:05.649 --> 42:09.119
More lies.

42:09.152 --> 42:11.121
No.

42:11.154 --> 42:13.790
I will go home.

42:13.824 --> 42:16.460
I will face them.

42:16.493 --> 42:19.663
And if I am condemned,

42:19.696 --> 42:21.632
it will be on your conscience,

42:21.665 --> 42:24.167
Talla Keyali.

42:26.169 --> 42:29.973
Please believe me.

42:30.006 --> 42:32.743
I do care about you.

42:33.744 --> 42:36.547
Take me to my ship.

42:38.249 --> 42:40.751
*

43:05.376 --> 43:07.611
*

43:16.620 --> 43:20.357
(sips, exhales)

43:20.391 --> 43:23.193
You know, the more I learn
about the Moclans,

43:23.226 --> 43:25.696
the more I see
that our differences

43:25.729 --> 43:27.531
go right to the core
of our values.

43:27.564 --> 43:28.865
I agree,

43:28.899 --> 43:30.867
but the Union needs them.

43:30.901 --> 43:32.569
Yeah.

43:32.603 --> 43:36.440
But how long can an alliance
with a culture like that last?

43:41.244 --> 43:43.213
(sighs)

43:43.246 --> 43:45.782
I'll see you later.

43:51.655 --> 43:53.089
(sighs)

43:54.090 --> 43:55.559
Hi there.

43:55.592 --> 43:56.727
Hi.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.395
I...

43:58.429 --> 44:01.798
noticed you haven't responded
to my messages.

44:01.832 --> 44:04.568
I didn't think
it was appropriate.

44:04.601 --> 44:06.903
Yeah, Groogen told me
what happened.

44:06.937 --> 44:08.605
-Groogen?
-The plant.

44:08.639 --> 44:09.973
Oh, right.

44:10.006 --> 44:11.642
Right.

44:11.675 --> 44:14.611
Kel,

44:14.645 --> 44:17.147
are you still in love with Ed?

44:18.281 --> 44:20.751
I'm...

44:20.784 --> 44:22.753
I'm always gonna have love
for Ed.

44:22.786 --> 44:24.455
He's part of my life.

44:24.488 --> 44:27.758
That wasn't exactly my question.

44:27.791 --> 44:30.293
It's the only way
I know how to answer.

44:30.327 --> 44:33.597
I'm gonna put in for a transfer.

44:33.630 --> 44:36.099
I have a standing offer
from the USS Watson

44:36.132 --> 44:38.301
to head up
their educational program.

44:38.335 --> 44:39.603
That's amazing.

44:39.636 --> 44:41.638
They're a lucky ship.

44:42.673 --> 44:44.975
It's been...

44:45.008 --> 44:48.011
a pleasure serving with you.

45:12.569 --> 45:15.138
Lieutenant,

45:15.171 --> 45:17.708
I wanted to thank you
for what you did.

45:17.741 --> 45:20.711
Bortus told me
to put my faith in you.

45:20.744 --> 45:22.679
He was correct.

45:22.713 --> 45:25.649
I was just doing my job.

45:25.682 --> 45:27.150
If you had not done your job,

45:27.183 --> 45:29.185
I would have gone to prison.

45:29.219 --> 45:31.688
I owe you a debt.

45:31.722 --> 45:33.990
You want to repay me,

45:34.024 --> 45:36.359
here's how.

45:36.393 --> 45:38.662
When you see me in the corridor,

45:38.695 --> 45:41.164
walk the other way.

45:41.197 --> 45:43.700
I do not understand.

45:43.734 --> 45:46.703
Locar didn't hurt you.

45:46.737 --> 45:49.205
He didn't hurt anyone.

45:49.239 --> 45:52.208
All he wanted was love.

45:52.242 --> 45:54.711
And yet, because of you,

45:54.745 --> 45:57.213
his life is over,

45:57.247 --> 46:02.686
for no reason
except your own prejudice.

46:02.719 --> 46:05.922
So, as far as I'm concerned,

46:05.956 --> 46:09.726
you can go straight to hell.

46:10.561 --> 46:13.430
* Tomorrow

46:13.464 --> 46:17.033
* Just you wait and see

46:17.067 --> 46:19.369
(door whooshes open)

46:19.402 --> 46:21.938
-* There'll be love
-(door whooshes shut)

46:21.972 --> 46:25.442
-* And laughter
-(sniffles)

46:25.476 --> 46:30.246
* And peace ever after

46:30.280 --> 46:33.617
* Tomorrow

46:33.650 --> 46:38.589
* When the world is free

46:38.622 --> 46:40.457
*

46:40.491 --> 46:45.261
* The shepherd
will tend his sheep *

46:45.295 --> 46:49.399
* The valley will bloom again

46:49.432 --> 46:54.905
* And Johnny will go to sleep

46:54.938 --> 46:59.743
* In his own little room again

46:59.776 --> 47:04.915
* There'll be bluebirds over

47:04.948 --> 47:10.153
* The White Cliffs of Dover

47:10.186 --> 47:13.089
* Tomorrow

47:13.123 --> 47:18.762
* Just you wait and see.

47:18.795 --> 47:20.997
*

48:22.693 --> 48:24.695
