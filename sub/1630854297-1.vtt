WEBVTT

00:08.976 --> 00:10.911
Did you know last year
had the most cops killed

00:11.011 --> 00:13.381
in the line of duty
since 9/11?

00:13.481 --> 00:15.649
Thanks for the
doom and gloom update.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.385
DISPATCH (over radio):
2-9 Charlie, you have a 10-52

00:17.485 --> 00:19.520
possible domestic at

00:19.620 --> 00:21.489
555 Christopher Street.

00:21.589 --> 00:22.690
That's right around the corner.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.093
Central, show 2-9 Charlie
responding.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.494
You got any more
good news?

00:26.594 --> 00:27.761
Doesn't look like it.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.164
You calling me a liar?!
(grunting)

00:30.264 --> 00:31.932
Whoa, hey, whoa! Hey! Police!

00:32.032 --> 00:33.367
Get off of her!

00:33.467 --> 00:35.303
(overlapping shouting)
Stop fighting me.

00:35.403 --> 00:36.837
(siren chirps)

00:36.937 --> 00:37.871
Son of a bitch!

00:37.971 --> 00:39.173
Hey!

00:39.273 --> 00:41.309
(grunting)

00:43.043 --> 00:44.112
Stop resisting!

00:44.212 --> 00:45.513
(shouting)
Enough.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.515
Keep her back.
Screw you, jerk-off.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.250
(panting)
Calm down. Take a breath.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.584
I didn't do anything!

00:50.684 --> 00:52.920
How about resisting arrest?
Gun. I got a gun.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.189
I'm sure you got a permit
for this, right?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.557
Man, I ain't got
to say anything.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.927
Okay. Get him out of here.
(Andre groans)

01:00.027 --> 01:01.529
You okay?

01:04.398 --> 01:05.799
(gallery murmuring)

01:06.834 --> 01:08.369
Your Honor,
may we approach?

01:08.469 --> 01:10.338
Approach.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.543
Your Honor, my witness, Marina
Parks, did not show up today.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.077
She's not returning
any phone calls.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.413
I'd like to suggest
an adjournment, so that...

01:19.513 --> 01:21.249
My client is entitled
to a speedy trial.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.083
...so that I may
locate her.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.120
We have reason to believe that
your client is the reason why

01:26.220 --> 01:27.721
my witness
did not show today.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.423
Yeah? And I have reason
to believe

01:29.523 --> 01:31.259
that your witness is a liar.
Ladies,

01:31.359 --> 01:33.394
do you have proof
of your accusations?

01:33.494 --> 01:34.962
No, Your Honor, but given...
I'll give you

01:35.062 --> 01:38.332
until this time Monday morning
to get Ms. Parks here.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.101
Your Honor...
Step back.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.538
The jurors are excused
for the day.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.540
This court
will reconvene

01:46.640 --> 01:48.876
9:00 a.m. Monday.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.244
(gavel bangs)

01:50.344 --> 01:52.313
She's not answering
our calls or texts.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.847
I'm gonna go over there
and check it out.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.716
Call Danny,
have him meet you, okay?

01:55.816 --> 01:58.051
That's his precinct.
Okay, I will.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.354
Hi, Jack. Bye, Jack.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.789
Anthony.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.261
You've been hard
to get ahold of lately.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.197
Ugh, I've been
so busy.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.531
I called and texted.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.433
Well, I'm in trial, Jack.

02:12.533 --> 02:13.867
Uh, do you remember
that pinball game

02:13.967 --> 02:15.603
that you used to
win at every night

02:15.703 --> 02:17.238
at that dive bar
in college?

02:17.338 --> 02:20.374
Uh, Striker Extreme?

02:20.474 --> 02:23.611
They have one at this
little place on Third...

02:23.711 --> 02:25.646
I have a million things
going on, Jack.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.748
(stammers) Uh...
Okay, but, actually,

02:27.848 --> 02:29.617
th-there is something that
I need to talk to you about.

02:29.717 --> 02:30.651
Um...
(sighs)

02:30.751 --> 02:31.952
It's about your run.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.522
Um, so can I take you
to lunch or dinner?

02:34.622 --> 02:37.024
I have no idea
what's on the schedule.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.760
Can I text you when I get back
to the office?

02:45.533 --> 02:47.235
Cap.
Oh, yeah.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.102
You're welcome
to have a seat.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.374
This have anything to do
with the DV arrest just now?

02:53.474 --> 02:54.375
No.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.410
Uh...

02:56.510 --> 02:58.379
Look, I know

02:58.479 --> 03:00.781
Espinoza had a certain way

03:00.881 --> 03:02.350
of managing the house.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.085
I have a different skill set,
different priorities.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.020
He decided that he was willing
to look the other way

03:07.120 --> 03:10.190
regarding certain things, and,
uh, I'm not willing to do that.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.459
What're you getting at?

03:11.559 --> 03:13.261
You're husband and wife.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.828
You work at the same precinct.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.430
There's no official
written guideline...
No,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.766
but it's not done, ever.
You know that.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.469
Well, we don't ride together.

03:21.569 --> 03:24.805
Yeah, but you often end up
responding to the same calls,

03:24.905 --> 03:26.106
like you did this morning.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.708
And which was handled
by the book.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.410
And resulted in a gun collar.

03:29.510 --> 03:33.347
Look, I don't want to be seen
as showing favoritism,

03:33.447 --> 03:34.948
and letting you guys
both work

03:35.048 --> 03:37.117
in the same house is just--
it's frowned upon,

03:37.217 --> 03:38.886
so...

03:38.986 --> 03:41.589
I'm gonna need one of you
to transfer.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.425
You've been captain, what,

03:44.525 --> 03:46.093
like, five, six days?

03:46.193 --> 03:47.461
Uh, two weeks.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.097
And separating us
is your top priority?

03:51.499 --> 03:53.066
Careful, Officer Janko.

03:53.166 --> 03:56.136
Okay, um, what do you
want us to do?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.838
By the end of tour today,

03:57.938 --> 04:00.341
I would like to know which one
of you would like to transfer.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.642
By the end of tour today...

04:01.742 --> 04:03.511
Dismissed.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.614
Eddie.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.185
People talk about
the lack of sleep,

04:12.286 --> 04:14.054
or the hunt for good child care.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.956
I'm-I'm not worried
about any of that.

04:16.056 --> 04:19.327
I'm more focused on what's
gonna happen when she's older.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.628
Well, don't rush it.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.563
There's plenty of time
between now and then.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.632
No, I-I mean,
I can't imagine

04:24.732 --> 04:26.700
letting her go
anywhere without me.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.869
I mean, how am I gonna
protect her from this world?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.704
Especially knowing
what we know.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.140
Well, by that time,
we'll have a 24-hour detail

04:33.240 --> 04:35.142
to protect her,
and we'll put one of those chips

04:35.242 --> 04:37.678
in her phone so we can keep
track of her 24 hours a day.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.179
Is that what you did
with Jack and Sean?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.148
Yeah, but they figured it out
and turned the thing off.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.016
Smart boys.
(laughs)

04:43.116 --> 04:45.218
Hey, Danny, Maria.
Hey. You, uh, have any luck

04:45.319 --> 04:46.620
finding Erin's witness?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.155
Not answering the phone
or the door.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.157
All right, well, maybe we can
get the super to let us in.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.592
Guess we can try.

04:51.692 --> 04:52.793
Eh, why not?
(truck door opens)

04:52.893 --> 04:54.795
What're you guys doing here?

04:54.895 --> 04:57.230
Hey. We could say
the same thing about you.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.632
I got a C.I. here.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.067
She called, scared,
said she's nervous

05:00.167 --> 05:01.802
that someone found out
she's working with us.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.937
Is her name Marina Parks?
Yeah. How do you know that?

05:04.037 --> 05:06.674
She was supposed to testify
this morning. Never showed up.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.410
Okay, well, now we better get
the super to let us in.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.679
(woman screams)

05:15.716 --> 05:17.618
Oh, boy.
You got that? I'm going up.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.652
Yeah. Go.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.654
On your back.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.893
DANNY:
She's gone.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.765
I think we found Erin's witness.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.133
"Soplona."

05:33.233 --> 05:34.935
Snitch.
Yeah.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.871
Snitch.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.945
* *

06:12.940 --> 06:14.608
(door opens)

06:22.082 --> 06:23.584
(sighs)

06:23.684 --> 06:25.318
So...

06:26.353 --> 06:27.888
Without further ado.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.724
What do you want first,
the bad news or the worse news?

06:30.824 --> 06:31.792
Straight up.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.661
Last quarter
set a record

06:33.761 --> 06:36.697
for the highest attrition
in department history.

06:36.797 --> 06:40.734
Guys cramming through the exits
in unprecedented numbers.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.338
But, boss, these things
are cyclical.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.608
What goes up, must come down.

06:47.708 --> 06:51.111
But you said a record,
most in NYPD history?

06:51.211 --> 06:53.447
Since they kept records,
anyway, yeah.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.319
There's been a change
in the ceremony renaming

06:59.419 --> 07:02.690
that Flatbush park
for the fallen firefighter.

07:02.790 --> 07:06.126
The change being
you've been disinvited.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.728
They give a reason?

07:07.828 --> 07:11.198
Officially, it was reframed
as FDNY only.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.567
So, the mayor's disinvited, too?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.969
Unofficially,
they felt that your presence

07:16.069 --> 07:17.437
might politicize the event.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.541
But the mayor,
who is actually a politician...

07:20.641 --> 07:22.109
Don't look for logic.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.512
(sighs)

07:26.046 --> 07:27.715
And the worse news?

07:28.949 --> 07:31.318
No, this is more
"sticks and stones,"

07:31.418 --> 07:32.853
and I wouldn't even bring it up,

07:32.953 --> 07:34.321
except the Post and the News
are gonna run it

07:34.421 --> 07:35.889
on tomorrow's...
Let's have it.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.760
A Hudson University/WNYR
poll shows that

07:39.860 --> 07:43.030
elected and appointed New York
City officials are lagging

07:43.130 --> 07:45.733
behind sports and media figures
in key areas,

07:45.833 --> 07:49.269
including leadership
and transparency.

07:49.369 --> 07:50.738
Including me.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.840
It's the whole basket,
you're not singled out.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.142
Oh.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.310
Who won?

07:57.410 --> 08:00.648
Well... Tom Hanks.

08:01.782 --> 08:02.983
Sure.

08:04.918 --> 08:08.188
(sighs) So...

08:08.288 --> 08:11.291
we got here slowly, but...

08:11.391 --> 08:12.760
then very fast.

08:12.860 --> 08:16.229
Where leaders are assumed
to be liars

08:16.329 --> 08:18.431
and institutions, by nature,

08:18.532 --> 08:20.968
are corrupt.

08:21.068 --> 08:24.504
And if anyone does reach out
across the aisle,

08:24.605 --> 08:26.974
it's probably just
to punch you in the nose.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.382
WWTRD.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.252
Excuse me?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.254
WWTRD?

08:41.354 --> 08:44.157
What would Teddy Roosevelt do?

08:44.257 --> 08:47.260
Oh, come on, give me a break.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.598
I'd love to,
but I'm-I'm dead serious.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.335
(sighs)

09:01.041 --> 09:02.876
(sighs)

09:04.678 --> 09:07.147
(elevator bell dings)
Marina Parks was dead on impact.

09:07.247 --> 09:10.150
Anthony and Joe went up to
the roof as soon as it happened,

09:10.250 --> 09:11.685
but they couldn't
find anyone.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.821
Building was connected
to half a dozen other roofs.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.823
He would've had no problem
making his getaway.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.691
Do we have anything
on cameras?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.292
Most of the cameras
didn't work.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.128
Signs of a struggle
in the apartment.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.730
Any witnesses?

09:22.830 --> 09:24.765
No one's come forward yet,
but we're still canvassing.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.567
Clearly, Mano Sangriento
is sending a message.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.670
Without her,
I have no case.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.606
Unless we could prove
that Munoz ordered the hit.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.675
Can you do that by Monday?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.911
I could try.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.456
I don't want to leave the 2-9.

09:49.556 --> 09:52.359
That's why I'm gonna ask
to be transferred.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.795
No. I want to work
wherever you work.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.064
Eddie, we can't work together
our whole career.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.298
Why not?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.599
You really need me
to answer that

09:59.700 --> 10:00.668
based off our meeting
this morning?

10:00.768 --> 10:01.969
I'm gonna
go in there

10:02.069 --> 10:04.137
and ask to be transferred,
all right?

10:04.237 --> 10:05.873
BADILLO:
Hey,

10:05.973 --> 10:07.340
Sarge, Eddie.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.910
We got another domestic
at the Castillo apartment.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.713
Go. Everything's gonna be fine.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.587
What made you
pick this place?

10:20.688 --> 10:21.889
What, you don't like it?

10:21.989 --> 10:23.223
It's a little
out of the way.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.026
Exactly. It's private.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.662
Since when do you care
about private dinners?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.163
Ah.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.899
Got it.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.566
Now that you're
gonna run for D.A.,

10:33.667 --> 10:35.368
you don't want any speculation
about your dinner dates,

10:35.468 --> 10:36.369
is that it?

10:36.469 --> 10:37.805
No.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.508
Maybe.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.043
Ever since I decided to run,

10:43.143 --> 10:45.378
I'm hyper aware
that everything I do

10:45.478 --> 10:46.780
will be under a microscope.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.116
And that includes
your relationship with me.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.284
I am sure I will be
asked questions

10:51.384 --> 10:52.820
about my personal life.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.521
And it's better if I'm
not in the picture?

10:54.621 --> 10:56.790
I would think you
wouldn't want your life

10:56.890 --> 10:58.425
under a microscope either.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.227
So, I should fade
into the woodwork?

11:00.327 --> 11:02.529
I didn't say that.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.431
But I

11:04.531 --> 11:07.567
assumed that's why
you wanted to speak.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.903
(chuckles) To be...
to be told to back off?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.539
You said it had to do
with my run,

11:12.639 --> 11:13.741
so I just assumed that...

11:13.841 --> 11:16.209
Yeah, and you assumed wrong.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.745
God, you know,

11:17.845 --> 11:20.547
sometimes I wonder about
how little you know me,

11:20.647 --> 11:23.150
not 25-year-old me,

11:23.250 --> 11:25.552
but me now.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.654
I'm not the same person.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.090
I didn't mean to insult you.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.425
What I...

11:32.525 --> 11:33.927
wanted to discuss was that

11:34.027 --> 11:36.563
I have someone
I want you to meet.

11:36.663 --> 11:39.432
Uh... Warren Bradford.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.901
He is

11:41.001 --> 11:43.103
someone who admires you
and your principles,

11:43.203 --> 11:45.038
and he wants
to support your run.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.406
How?

11:46.506 --> 11:49.009
With a $3 million contribution
to your campaign.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.245
Which exceeds
the contribution limits.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.782
Not if he creates a PAC
to help you get elected.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.317
In exchange for what?

11:57.417 --> 12:00.087
Frank and honest conversation.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.222
Not everyone

12:02.322 --> 12:04.691
has ulterior motives, Erin.

12:04.792 --> 12:05.993
He is the real deal.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.928
Jack, three million...
You know what?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.963
Just tell me if you're
willing to meet him,

12:10.063 --> 12:12.165
and I will make
the introduction,

12:12.265 --> 12:13.700
and I'll disappear.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.869
Last thing I want to be
is a liability.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.712
Police. Open up!

12:25.813 --> 12:27.714
She's not answering.

12:27.815 --> 12:30.250
Dispatch said
she called from here.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.953
Maybe the super
knows where she is.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.488
SOFIA: Help me! Help me!
ANDRE: Get in the car!

12:35.588 --> 12:36.556
SOFIA:
Somebody help me!

12:36.656 --> 12:38.892
(gunshots)

12:42.595 --> 12:43.997
JANKO:
2-9 Charlie,

12:44.097 --> 12:45.999
we got shots fired at this
location. Possible female

12:46.099 --> 12:47.835
abducted in a black
two-door coupe

12:47.935 --> 12:50.170
with New York plates,
heading north on Broadway.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.341
Come on!

12:54.441 --> 12:55.408
What?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.044
He slashed our tires.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.946
Damn it.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.355
Andre Castillo
was released?

13:08.455 --> 13:10.123
I have a million things
going on here, Jamie.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.458
We arrested him.
I know.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.493
On a domestic
violence charge.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.195
And possession
of a gun.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.629
Unloaded.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.331
Oh, because the guys
with unloaded guns

13:18.431 --> 13:19.666
have no intention
of using them, right?

13:19.766 --> 13:21.534
What do you want,
Jamie?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.536
If you're here to complain
about bail reform, get in line.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.372
Did you know that,
because you guys released him,

13:25.472 --> 13:27.374
he went back out,
with a loaded gun,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.642
and shot at two officers,
including Eddie...

13:29.742 --> 13:30.978
Wait, what?
...and then

13:31.078 --> 13:32.612
abducted his wife.
Is she okay?

13:32.712 --> 13:34.614
They're fine.
Erin, but that's not the point.

13:34.714 --> 13:35.983
The point is
he got released

13:36.083 --> 13:37.250
without so much as a heads-up.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.286
Jamie, I understand
why you're upset,

13:39.386 --> 13:41.288
but I'm in the middle
of a trial right now,

13:41.388 --> 13:42.822
and I just lost my only witness.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.591
If you're gonna release
violent criminals,

13:44.691 --> 13:46.426
maybe we could at least
give the victims a warning.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.694
I didn't even handle this case,

13:47.794 --> 13:49.596
not that that
should even matter.

13:49.696 --> 13:52.732
Right, so that's-that's just
all there is to it, is that it?

13:53.867 --> 13:55.468
New York bail laws

13:55.568 --> 13:57.337
do not allow judges

13:57.437 --> 13:59.873
to determine
if the defendant is dangerous,

13:59.973 --> 14:01.841
and you are the last person I
should have to explain that to.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.743
Why should I bother
arresting them anymore,

14:03.843 --> 14:05.845
Erin, if they're just gonna go
right back out and do it again

14:05.946 --> 14:07.981
because this building is
a revolving door for criminals.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.717
You know what? I expect this
from Danny, not from you.

14:10.817 --> 14:13.286
Because why? I'm the quiet one?
I'm the careful one?

14:13.386 --> 14:14.955
The one that'll just
stand by and watch

14:15.055 --> 14:16.756
as the whole justice system
falls apart?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.458
Because what's the point
in getting upset

14:18.558 --> 14:20.961
if there's just no one to blame?

14:21.895 --> 14:24.364
Maybe I don't want to be
the quiet one anymore.

14:37.644 --> 14:38.545
Hi.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.280
Hi.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.915
Are we allowed to talk
in such a public space,

14:42.015 --> 14:44.584
or should I have brought
a disguise?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.187
I made a lot
of assumptions, Jack,

14:47.287 --> 14:48.321
and I'm sorry.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.457
It's an occupational hazard.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.926
I get that you want to

14:53.026 --> 14:54.861
curate your public persona

14:54.962 --> 14:56.896
for the D.A. run,

14:56.997 --> 14:59.232
but what exactly
are you so afraid of?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.401
That I have
some hidden

15:01.501 --> 15:03.470
secrets that are gonna
make you look bad?

15:03.570 --> 15:04.871
O-Or is it that
you don't want

15:04.972 --> 15:06.873
to be publicly linked
to your ex-husband?

15:08.608 --> 15:11.011
I don't, I don't know.
Maybe both.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.612
I mean,
you and I

15:12.712 --> 15:15.515
are in limbo, Jack.
We date, we fool around,

15:15.615 --> 15:16.984
but we're not committed
to each other, and...

15:17.084 --> 15:20.253
I asked you to move in.
You said no.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.689
I-I've been
taking your lead.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.657
You made it clear
that you had reservations

15:24.757 --> 15:26.526
about taking
the next step.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.995
That's on you,
not me.

15:28.095 --> 15:31.431
I guess I'm just still
trying to figure out...

15:32.765 --> 15:35.702
...what I want the narrative
of my personal life to be.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.437
And those questions
will be asked

15:37.537 --> 15:40.540
when the press
dive into the past,

15:40.640 --> 15:43.143
and I'm just not ready
for that yet.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.745
(sighs) Okay.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.548
Okay. Um...

15:48.648 --> 15:51.018
But you don't need
to decide that

15:51.118 --> 15:52.919
right now, right?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.454
Right.

15:54.554 --> 15:58.025
So, we can have clandestine
meetings until you decide.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.394
Might be kind of hot.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.132
And as far as
Warren Bradford goes,

16:05.232 --> 16:06.666
there are no strings attached.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.701
I-I'm just happy
to make the introduction.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.403
I got to go.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.839
I have a deposition
in ten minutes.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.807
All right?

16:14.907 --> 16:16.376
I'll call you.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.033
Your Eminence.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.135
Commissioner.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.337
We are going out.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.638
Since when?

16:45.738 --> 16:48.208
Since I ask,
and you owe me a favor.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.609
Now, go change your clothes.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.944
I don't owe you a thing,
and-and change into what?

16:52.045 --> 16:54.047
Regular clothes,
no cross, no collar,

16:54.147 --> 16:57.750
just two guys out on the town
having a good time.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.986
But I already have
my evening planned.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.522
You have absolutely nothing
on your schedule

17:02.622 --> 17:05.092
till a park dedication
in Flatbush

17:05.192 --> 17:06.626
tomorrow morning.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.528
What's this all about, Frank?

17:08.628 --> 17:10.730
(sighs)

17:12.465 --> 17:14.367
(sighs)

17:14.467 --> 17:16.536
What's it all about?

17:16.636 --> 17:19.472
It's about two leaders
who've lost their flocks.

17:19.572 --> 17:20.973
I haven't lost my flock.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.076
We both have.

17:24.077 --> 17:24.844
But, I guess,

17:24.944 --> 17:27.180
we both loom so large,

17:27.280 --> 17:30.383
nobody's been able to get up
the guts to tell us that.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.552
I don't need anybody
to tell me that.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.854
Yeah, you do,

17:34.954 --> 17:37.324
and so do I.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.658
Let's go.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.327
Go where?
Out.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.595
To the precincts and churches,

17:42.695 --> 17:44.063
the jails, the shelters.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.233
Just the way Teddy Roosevelt
and Jacob Riis

17:46.333 --> 17:48.168
used to do back in the day.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.372
(sighs)

17:52.472 --> 17:54.107
Kevin,

17:54.207 --> 17:56.409
please.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.146
I need your company.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.218
Your detail or mine?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.687
No details, just you and me.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.922
Well, I don't drive anymore,
and, quite frankly,

18:10.022 --> 18:11.391
I'm not aware of your skills.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.660
Well, we're gonna take
the subways,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.195
just like our flocks.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.130
Well, with all due respect
to your cops,

18:17.230 --> 18:19.332
I'm not riding
the subway at night.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.068
And, yes,
that is a deal breaker.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.603
Okay, we'll hail cabs.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.005
I have Uber on my phone.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.409
(sighs) Riis and Roosevelt
did not have cell phones,

18:29.509 --> 18:30.643
so neither will we.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.379
Well, what if something happens?

18:32.479 --> 18:33.813
(taps fingers)

18:33.913 --> 18:36.249
You bring the rosary,
I'll bring the gun.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.888
MUNOZ (over recording):
What do I want you
to do about it?

18:41.988 --> 18:43.556
I want you to kill the bitch.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.724
CASTILLO (over recording):
Consider it done.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.793
Got this from
a jailhouse phone call

18:46.893 --> 18:48.995
that Munoz made
from Rikers,

18:49.095 --> 18:50.930
ordering the hit
on Erin's witness.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.732
Any idea who
he was talking to?

18:52.832 --> 18:55.635
Phone records indicate it was
Andre Castillo, his enforcer.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.937
Let's see what
Castillo's been up to.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.939
BAEZ:
Here we go.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.410
He was recently arrested

19:03.510 --> 19:05.545
on a domestic violence charge.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.879
When was the complaint made?

19:06.979 --> 19:09.382
Yesterday.
Yesterday? Is he still in?

19:09.482 --> 19:10.683
He was ROR'd.

19:10.783 --> 19:11.984
Oh, great.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.453
BAEZ:
And the first thing he did

19:13.553 --> 19:14.721
was abduct his wife.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.224
Arresting officer,
Jamison Reagan.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.059
Want to set out to Rikers
and have a chat with him?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.594
Yeah.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.330
(phone rings)

19:23.430 --> 19:24.831
Hey, Danny, what's up?

19:24.931 --> 19:27.066
You're working a case
against an Andre Castillo?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.301
Yeah. Why?

19:28.401 --> 19:29.669
I like him for a homicide
that I'm working.

19:29.769 --> 19:30.970
I'm coming from
his place right now.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.772
I don't think
he's been back there,

19:32.872 --> 19:34.207
but the super just told me
he keeps a boat

19:34.307 --> 19:36.409
at the Queens Boat Basin.
I'm headed there now.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.945
Okay, I'll meet you there
with Joe.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.592
(indistinct chatter nearby)

19:52.692 --> 19:54.661
ANDRE:
Now! Do what I say.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.529
Stop arguing.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.097
Get in the back!
Central 29 Sergeant,

19:58.197 --> 19:59.532
upgrade that 85

19:59.632 --> 20:00.933
to a forthwith,
and if you got any Harbor units

20:01.033 --> 20:02.369
in the area,
have them come over.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.371
Go under!

20:04.471 --> 20:06.205
Do it or else!

20:26.626 --> 20:27.860
Gun!

20:28.461 --> 20:29.762
(gunshot)
(grunts)

20:30.630 --> 20:31.731
(grunts)

20:31.831 --> 20:33.132
Jamie! Jamie!

20:34.100 --> 20:35.802
(gunshots)

20:39.038 --> 20:41.007
(grunts)

20:44.277 --> 20:45.778
Let me see. Let me see.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.916
10-13. 10-13.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.519
Officer shot.
Queens Boat Basin.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.086
We can't wait for a bus.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.088
It's under the vest.
Come on, help me get him up.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.690
Come on. Come on!

20:57.790 --> 21:00.092
Jamie, you keep fighting,
you hear me?

21:00.192 --> 21:02.194
We got it from here.
Look at me, Jamie.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.330
Danny...

21:03.430 --> 21:04.631
Keep fighting.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.132
Hey, you take care
of him, all right?

21:06.232 --> 21:07.400
That's my brother,
you hear me?

21:07.500 --> 21:08.435
I know.
Take care of him.

21:08.535 --> 21:09.902
Wait right here.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.214
(elevator bell dings)

21:22.315 --> 21:24.317
J-Jam-Jamie.
Where is-- Where's Jamie?

21:24.417 --> 21:26.052
Where's Jamie?
Mrs. Reagan.

21:26.152 --> 21:27.554
Yes, I'm his wife.
Don't worry.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.422
Why don't you have a seat?
We're taking good care of him.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.823
No, no. Where is he?
Where is he?
It's okay.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.725
This is my brother's stuff,
let me take that.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.126
Okay. Okay?

21:34.226 --> 21:35.662
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.
Jamie!

21:35.762 --> 21:37.964
Jamie! Jamie!
We're doing everything we can,

21:38.064 --> 21:39.899
but you can't come in.
You got to fight, Jamie,
you got to fight!

21:39.999 --> 21:41.734
NURSE:
As soon as he's stabilized...

21:41.834 --> 21:43.470
You can't leave me!
I got her.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.104
You can't leave me alone, Jamie.
Don't you dare

21:45.204 --> 21:46.305
leave me alone, okay?

21:46.406 --> 21:48.941
(crying)
Come on.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.209
It's okay.

21:50.309 --> 21:54.213
(indistinct chatter)

21:54.313 --> 21:56.616
All right.
Thank you.

21:58.585 --> 22:01.087
Still no word.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.089
You get in touch
with Dad yet?

22:03.189 --> 22:05.324
No. He's off the radar.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.394
Baker doesn't even know
where he is.

22:07.494 --> 22:10.196
And his cell phone just keeps
going to voice mail.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.499
Great.

22:17.236 --> 22:20.507
Roosevelt and Riis
walked down these streets alone

22:20.607 --> 22:24.243
to see what was real,
and what was ass-covering.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.745
And did they find
the real problems?

22:25.845 --> 22:28.781
Yeah, and they actually
did something about 'em.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.282
Boy, those were the days, huh?

22:30.383 --> 22:32.251
Yeah.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.587
(engines revving)
(cheering)

22:44.564 --> 22:48.468
Is that precinct closed
for vacation?

22:48.568 --> 22:50.803
(cheering continues)

22:53.573 --> 22:55.908
No such thing.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.613
I'm sorry, Frank.
That's got to hurt.

23:04.651 --> 23:07.587
Maybe we need
a new sheriff in town.

23:09.656 --> 23:13.392
Now, come on, don't go
all wobbly on me.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.570
(clears throat)

23:23.670 --> 23:26.005
What can I do for you,
young fella?

23:26.105 --> 23:27.774
How about doing
your job, Sergeant?

23:27.874 --> 23:30.042
There's a biker gang
right out front.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.377
I know that.

23:31.478 --> 23:32.612
But they're breaking
all kinds of laws.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.346
Are you a resident
of this block?

23:34.447 --> 23:36.048
Does that matter?

23:36.148 --> 23:37.650
It does if you want to file
a noise complaint.

23:37.750 --> 23:38.885
They're blocking traffic

23:38.985 --> 23:40.553
and they're menacing
pedestrians.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.954
Any casualties out there?

23:42.054 --> 23:44.123
That's not the point.
It kind of is.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.526
See, they usually just stay
for a couple stoplight cycles

23:46.626 --> 23:47.860
and move on.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.328
They don't seem to be
going anywhere.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.630
We don't want to risk
getting shot at,

23:50.730 --> 23:52.331
or, God forbid,
fire our own weapons

23:52.431 --> 23:53.966
on some idiots pulling wheelies.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.502
Pops,

23:55.602 --> 23:58.838
it's a jungle out there,
and that's that.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.746
That your own
personal battle plan,

24:06.846 --> 24:09.081
or did it come from upstairs?

24:09.181 --> 24:11.618
Commissioner Reagan.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.686
Good guess, Sergeant.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.489
It's-- It's, um...

24:16.589 --> 24:19.592
Free pass, I swear.

24:19.692 --> 24:20.993
The honest answer.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.963
It's kind of the way
of the world now, sir.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.200
My friend and I are doing
a little recon.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.403
Nowadays they call that
a "listening tour."

24:31.504 --> 24:32.672
I was never here.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.542
Copy that, sir.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.111
Stay safe, Sergeant.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.581
If that is not redundant.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.953
Tell me he's okay.

24:50.056 --> 24:52.592
He got hit below the vest.
(sighs)

24:54.093 --> 24:55.227
Oh, my God.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.796
Sorry to hear that.
Is he gonna be okay?

24:56.896 --> 24:59.031
Don't know. Waiting on word
from the doc.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.868
Andre Castillo shot him.
ERIN:
Castillo?

25:01.968 --> 25:02.935
He was ROR'd.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.871
Jamie came in to
complain about it.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.807
So if Castillo isn't released,
Jamie isn't shot.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.876
Come on, you don't
know that.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.478
He got shot trying
to protect us.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.115
Ms. Reagan.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.885
Just say it.

25:18.985 --> 25:22.088
There's one bullet
lodged near his spine.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.691
Can you remove it?

25:24.791 --> 25:26.425
We're getting him ready
to operate right now.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.427
But he's gonna be okay, right?

25:28.527 --> 25:29.696
He's lost a lot of blood,

25:29.796 --> 25:32.198
and the bullet is
very close to the spine.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.637
Meaning what?

25:37.737 --> 25:39.105
Meaning that even if
I can successfully remove it,

25:39.205 --> 25:42.508
there's always a possibility
that he'll be paralyzed.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.510
(weakly):
what?

25:44.611 --> 25:47.113
Do you want a priest
to see him?

25:47.213 --> 25:49.348
What the hell are we
talking about here, Doc?

25:49.448 --> 25:51.417
I'm only asking
if you want one.

25:51.517 --> 25:55.788
What we want is for you
to fix him up... right.

26:09.501 --> 26:12.972
I think the way it works is
you gotta put some money in

26:13.072 --> 26:15.141
in order to get something out.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.609
I don't even want anything.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.077
I just wanted
something to do

26:18.177 --> 26:21.047
instead of sit around
and wait.
You do realize

26:21.147 --> 26:23.449
that the only person
responsible for this

26:23.549 --> 26:24.784
is the shooter, right?

26:24.884 --> 26:27.153
Says the guy who storms
into my office

26:27.253 --> 26:30.456
every other week to complain
about the justice system.

26:30.556 --> 26:31.624
Well, you're my sister.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.425
Who else am I gonna
complain to?

26:33.525 --> 26:35.662
You didn't see how angry
Jamie was

26:35.762 --> 26:37.196
when he came in to see me.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.264
I can imagine.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.599
It's called letting off steam.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.269
You should try it sometime.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.205
What is that supposed to mean?

26:46.305 --> 26:47.707
(sighs)

26:47.807 --> 26:50.209
You remember family fun nights
when we were kids?

26:51.010 --> 26:53.579
Yeah. Game nights
were my favorite. Why?

26:53.680 --> 26:55.514
You remember because
you always won.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.117
So much so that
I asked Mom

26:58.217 --> 27:01.988
to remove game night
from the fun night rotation.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.422
She said no.

27:03.522 --> 27:07.126
She said it was important
for your sister, you,

27:07.226 --> 27:08.761
living in a house
full of guys,

27:08.861 --> 27:10.462
to win sometime.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.264
But more importantly,

27:12.364 --> 27:14.734
to be able to let off steam.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.436
I didn't know that.

27:17.536 --> 27:18.938
Mm.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.107
She was right, of course.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.211
Even though she probably
was just trying to keep

27:25.311 --> 27:28.681
all the high school boys from
chasing you around all the time.

27:42.929 --> 27:45.631
Well, this one's
your nickel, so...

27:45.732 --> 27:48.701
Following the mass on Sunday,

27:48.801 --> 27:52.504
this church will be
completely closed down

27:52.604 --> 27:55.207
after 123 years.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.309
Sold off for parts.

27:58.677 --> 28:02.481
Because?
The neighborhood changed.

28:02.581 --> 28:03.983
The faithful got priced out,

28:04.083 --> 28:05.551
and the newcomers
didn't join up.

28:05.651 --> 28:08.520
I've ordered the doors
to be open 24/7

28:08.620 --> 28:09.722
so that everybody
could gather

28:09.822 --> 28:11.323
and pay their final respects.

28:11.423 --> 28:16.462
Well, Kevin, Friday night's
not exactly prime time

28:16.562 --> 28:18.630
for churchgoing, so...

28:18.731 --> 28:22.634
(scoffs) If this was a bar,
we'd say... (clears throat)

28:22.735 --> 28:25.237
"It's dead here.
Let's go someplace else."

28:38.217 --> 28:39.351
Damn.

28:41.888 --> 28:44.824
The chalice is gone.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.160
That chalice was smuggled
out of Warsaw

28:48.260 --> 28:51.030
during a German invasion,
found its way here.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.533
Solid gold, with emeralds
and diamonds.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.069
Not to mention priceless.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.306
(gasps softly)

29:00.406 --> 29:03.910
The donation box
for the votive candles.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.045
There was never more than
20 bucks in there.

29:06.145 --> 29:09.248
(sighs)
But it's not just
the amount.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.084
No, it isn't.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.057
Kevin, I'm gonna
call it in.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.927
Is there a phone
in the sacristy?

29:29.869 --> 29:30.870
Kevin?

29:30.970 --> 29:34.240
Please don't call it in, Frank.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.541
Why not?

29:35.641 --> 29:37.643
Because I asked.

29:37.743 --> 29:39.245
You gotta make
a police report.

29:39.345 --> 29:43.082
Look, you said that
we both lost our flocks.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.852
Well, my flock is
based in faith.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.888
And calling the police would be
an act of good citizenship,

29:48.988 --> 29:51.390
yeah, but it would not be
an act of faith.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.425
Then what is the act of faith?

29:53.525 --> 29:55.862
To pray for the sinner.

29:55.962 --> 29:57.663
Pray that a crisis of
conscience compels them

29:57.763 --> 29:59.631
to bring the chalice back.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.700
Or that somebody
close to him

30:01.800 --> 30:02.869
brings it to bear.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.237
Kevin, you think
some irate dad

30:05.337 --> 30:08.908
is gonna haul his kid in
and make him fess up?

30:09.008 --> 30:10.409
What world are you living in?

30:10.509 --> 30:13.212
The same one I have
always lived in.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.783
Well, I have seen too much

30:17.884 --> 30:20.319
to believe in that world
anymore. (sighs)

30:20.419 --> 30:24.256
Yeah, we both have
a lot of work to do.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.063
* *

30:41.107 --> 30:42.541
He's out of surgery.

30:42.641 --> 30:45.377
We were able to remove
the bullet, and he's stable.

30:46.445 --> 30:47.579
Thank God.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.981
What about his spine?

30:49.081 --> 30:51.317
We won't know if there's
any spinal damage

30:51.417 --> 30:52.584
until he wakes up.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.852
For now, he's resting
comfortably.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.687
When can I see him?

30:55.787 --> 30:58.557
I'll send a nurse to get you
as soon as he's brought to ICU.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.494
Thank you, Doctor.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.596
I'll be back when he wakes up.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.498
Don't even think about
telling me to back off.

31:06.598 --> 31:08.834
Wouldn't dream of it, Nephew.

31:09.735 --> 31:12.271
He docked the boat at the marina
in Flushing Meadows

31:12.371 --> 31:13.739
and got into a Toyota Camry.

31:13.839 --> 31:15.574
We think he's heading
to a printing factory

31:15.674 --> 31:17.576
he used to work at.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.078
It's at 600 Messerole.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.879
Copy that. On our way.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.551
You okay?

31:26.986 --> 31:27.920
Yeah.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.255
You sure you're okay?

31:29.355 --> 31:33.993
Yeah. It's just earlier today,
in the waiting room.

31:34.093 --> 31:37.863
Uh, I was thinking that
it must be...

31:37.964 --> 31:40.799
eerie for you guys,
because of how my dad died.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.403
Not eerie. Scary.

31:46.973 --> 31:51.177
Look, how do you learn
to let go?

31:51.277 --> 31:55.681
How do you all continue on
being cops and doing the job?

31:55.781 --> 31:57.984
How do you move on
from that?

31:58.084 --> 32:00.719
I just...

32:00.819 --> 32:05.992
I do the job, but...
I do it with him.

32:07.426 --> 32:11.697
He's... he's always there.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.801
And here and here.

32:17.936 --> 32:22.408
He's never not with us,
if that makes sense.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.543
Yeah.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.114
It does.

32:28.214 --> 32:29.615
(sirens whooping)

32:29.715 --> 32:31.717
We got Castillo's car.

32:31.817 --> 32:34.620
He left it here approximately
at 3:15 today.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.488
How do you know it's his?

32:36.588 --> 32:38.890
'Cause he left
another message for us.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.097
Do we know where he is?

32:45.197 --> 32:46.365
We got a location for him.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.499
Danny's on his way
over there now.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.301
Had a conference
with Judge Hall.

32:49.401 --> 32:52.204
She's gonna allow Marina Parks'
grand jury testimony

32:52.304 --> 32:53.772
in the Munoz trial.

32:53.872 --> 32:55.674
That's great news.
And after that trial,

32:55.774 --> 32:59.145
we're gonna get Munoz indicted
for Sofia's murder.

32:59.245 --> 33:02.514
And with any luck we'll have
Andre Castillo in custody

33:02.614 --> 33:04.150
for her murder by then, too.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.984
Nice work, Anthony.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.122
Oh, no.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.458
I see those wheels turning.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.492
What are you thinking about?

33:13.592 --> 33:16.095
Family fun night.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.896
Come again?

33:17.996 --> 33:20.132
Long story.

33:20.232 --> 33:21.267
You okay?

33:21.367 --> 33:22.868
I will be.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.874
* *

33:45.357 --> 33:47.126
* *

33:57.736 --> 33:59.938
(grunting)

34:00.038 --> 34:01.340
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.609
Cuff him.
Yep.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.113
(grunting)

34:08.214 --> 34:10.116
Come on.

34:12.618 --> 34:13.985
Get him out of here.

34:14.086 --> 34:16.655
Now!
(spits)

34:16.755 --> 34:19.024
OFFICER: Suspect
is apprehended!

34:20.192 --> 34:22.094
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?

34:22.194 --> 34:24.530
We do it by the book, okay?
Why?

34:24.630 --> 34:25.797
What do you mean why?

34:25.897 --> 34:26.998
Why?

34:27.099 --> 34:29.468
'Cause that's what
Jamie would do.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.738
That's what your
old man would do.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.706
So that's what we do.

34:35.507 --> 34:38.810
Come on. Come on.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.812
(elevator bell dings)

34:42.248 --> 34:43.949
Hey, hi.

34:44.049 --> 34:45.884
Captain.

34:45.984 --> 34:48.620
I, uh, I wanted to
come over

34:48.720 --> 34:51.623
and stop by in person
and see how you're doing.

34:51.723 --> 34:55.227
Oh, he's just getting
some tests.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.662
We're holding up okay.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.765
Yeah? Good.
Good news, good news.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.170
You doing--
You doing some reading?

35:04.270 --> 35:08.039
I've read every magazine
in this place twice.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.909
So I-I...
Now I officially know

35:11.009 --> 35:15.681
the haircut that I'm not
allowed to get after 40.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.383
Apparently, women over 40,

35:17.483 --> 35:20.286
they can't wear miniskirts,
or fishnet stockings either.

35:20.386 --> 35:23.355
I should start now,
while I still can.

35:23.455 --> 35:27.193
They never write those articles
for men over 40.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.928
I guess they get to wear
whatever they want, huh?

35:30.028 --> 35:31.197
Right.

35:31.297 --> 35:34.966
Anyways, uh, I'm really
glad to know

35:35.066 --> 35:38.036
that the surgery went well.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.906
The whole house is
rooting for him.

35:42.408 --> 35:44.376
Thanks.

35:46.445 --> 35:52.083
If-if you need anything,
you just let me know.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.389
Actually, there is something
you can do for me.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.291
Yeah, anything.
Anything.

36:00.926 --> 36:04.796
You can keep Jamie
and I together at the 2-9,

36:04.896 --> 36:06.398
because that's where
we belong.

36:06.498 --> 36:12.204
Eddie, that was not a
personal decision, it was...

36:12.304 --> 36:13.672
It's personal to me.

36:13.772 --> 36:17.209
I need to be in the same house
as my husband,

36:17.309 --> 36:19.578
because I need to be
the first person to know

36:19.678 --> 36:21.380
if something bad
happens to him,

36:21.480 --> 36:22.981
like it did this week.

36:23.081 --> 36:26.352
I need to be the first person
by his side.

36:26.452 --> 36:29.688
I don't want to hear about
rules and regulations,

36:29.788 --> 36:31.590
because there aren't any.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.360
It's at your discretion.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.798
So, yeah, that's something
you can do for me.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.169
(busy chatter)

36:45.571 --> 36:46.538
How's he doing?

36:46.638 --> 36:48.206
Well, we all took turns

36:48.307 --> 36:49.140
going in to see him

36:49.241 --> 36:50.842
before we got kicked out.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.211
He's gonna be okay.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.480
Good to hear.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.682
Yeah.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.850
I was surprised
when I got your call.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.051
Well, you know me.
I can never let

37:00.151 --> 37:02.388
a challenge pass me by.
(chuckles)

37:02.488 --> 37:05.557
Nothing fancy, just a
burger/beer kind of place.

37:05.657 --> 37:09.094
Well, I could use a burger
and a beer. Thank you.

37:10.262 --> 37:11.963
You do realize I'm not
gonna let you win.

37:12.063 --> 37:15.033
Since when have you ever
let me win at anything?

37:15.133 --> 37:17.836
The first time we met.
The intramural basketball game.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.539
Uh, no, I creamed you
fair and square.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.308
Yeah, but I didn't care
about the game,

37:22.408 --> 37:23.509
I just wanted a date.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.143
You twisted your ankle
that night.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.846
Yeah. And that was
just a ploy.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.115
Is that what's happening
right now?

37:30.215 --> 37:32.451
Maybe.

37:32.551 --> 37:35.086
Is it working?
Maybe.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.357
You got any quarters?

37:38.457 --> 37:40.191
Maybe.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.761
Oh.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.863
Game on.

37:47.799 --> 37:48.834
Oh, the ankle.

37:48.934 --> 37:52.070
(laughs)
Still hurts so bad.

37:52.170 --> 37:54.706
Remember how to...?
Even after all these years.
Uh-huh.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.742
All right, what are we
playing for?

37:56.842 --> 37:59.778
(whispers indistinctly)

38:01.413 --> 38:02.881
Okay.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.550
(bells ringing)

38:04.650 --> 38:06.752
Yeah!
Look at you go.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.693
DANNY:
Look at that.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.562
He's already milking it
for all it's worth.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.063
You better believe it.

38:18.163 --> 38:19.931
How long you gonna
make Eddie do all the work?

38:20.031 --> 38:21.733
Oh, as long as possible.

38:21.833 --> 38:22.901
(scoffs)
We're parked out back.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.169
You guys ready to go?

38:24.269 --> 38:25.637
Yeah. You guys didn't
tell anyone

38:25.737 --> 38:28.073
outside the family
I'm being discharged, right?

38:28.173 --> 38:30.175
JANKO:
That's what you asked for.
Yeah. Thanks.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.077
I just want to slide
under the radar.

38:32.177 --> 38:33.712
So now you want to go back
to being the quiet one.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.313
Is that what that is? Okay.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.615
Let's go.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.384
You know, if you really want
to be the quiet one,

38:38.484 --> 38:40.285
you should probably stop,
I don't know,

38:40.386 --> 38:42.120
jumping in front
of bullets maybe.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.655
(chuckles)
I think I liked you guys better

38:43.755 --> 38:45.524
when you weren't sure
if I was gonna make it.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.993
(quiet chatter)

38:48.093 --> 38:50.362
WOMAN:
All right.

39:02.273 --> 39:03.442
(applause)

39:09.114 --> 39:12.951
(cheering swells)

39:13.051 --> 39:15.887
(all cheering, whistling)

39:22.060 --> 39:23.829
(cheering, whooping)

39:48.153 --> 39:50.321
And, God bless him,
the archbishop goes

39:50.422 --> 39:52.758
all Bing Crosby
in Going My Way,

39:52.858 --> 39:56.695
and wants to wait for the perp
to turn himself in.

39:56.795 --> 39:57.963
(laughter)

39:58.063 --> 39:59.397
Well, this one's answer
to everything is,

39:59.498 --> 40:00.866
"Quick, call the cops."

40:00.966 --> 40:02.901
(laughter)
Well, good on you.

40:03.001 --> 40:03.969
Yeah, I'm with you, too.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.403
The world needs more of that.

40:05.504 --> 40:06.705
Not the world I live in.

40:06.805 --> 40:09.274
Me neither, sorry to say.
Mm-hmm.

40:09.374 --> 40:11.910
Jamison?
Stuck in the middle?

40:12.010 --> 40:14.045
In a perfect world,
I'm with you, but

40:14.145 --> 40:16.948
lying on the pavement with
a bullet in me, I'm with them.

40:18.283 --> 40:19.851
So did he turn himself in?

40:19.951 --> 40:22.087
Not as of yet,
but the pastor of the church

40:22.187 --> 40:23.855
wisely switched out
the gold chalice

40:23.955 --> 40:27.192
for a cheap tin one,
so the loss is still spiritual,

40:27.292 --> 40:28.860
but it's not financial.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.663
Your Eminence, it's a great
honor to have you here today.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.465
Well, thank you, Henry.

40:33.565 --> 40:36.334
Your son is a little loose
with the guff, though.

40:37.368 --> 40:38.970
That's how he breaks in
the rookies.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.639
And how am I a rookie?

40:40.739 --> 40:42.207
First time at the table.

40:42.307 --> 40:45.276
It's true.
They bust chops.

40:45.376 --> 40:46.478
Even when you're lying
in a hospital bed

40:46.578 --> 40:47.579
with a bullet wound.

40:47.679 --> 40:48.714
That's true, except

40:48.814 --> 40:50.181
I'm gonna
go easy on you today

40:50.281 --> 40:52.250
because I'm hoping to
get myself into heaven.

40:52.350 --> 40:54.219
I wish you good luck
with that.
Thank you.

40:54.319 --> 40:56.988
The line forms behind me.

40:58.089 --> 41:00.458
But it's an honor
to have you.

41:01.627 --> 41:05.163
And it's a great joy
to have you.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.366
Pop.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.536
Hear, hear.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.170
Second that.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.674
Third.
Fourth.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.375
Truly.

41:19.745 --> 41:21.847
Okay, so can we eat?

41:21.947 --> 41:23.014
Yeah.
DANNY: Yeah.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.449
Who's saying grace?

41:24.550 --> 41:26.151
I thought you were all
hot to get to heaven.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.787
I am. It'd just be more official
if you said it, though.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.355
(chuckles)

41:30.455 --> 41:31.790
Oh, yeah. If you said grace
it'd be awesome.

41:31.890 --> 41:33.525
It'd be like going to
a Stones tribute concert,

41:33.625 --> 41:35.060
and then in the middle
of the show,

41:35.160 --> 41:36.494
Keith and Mick just
walk out on stage.

41:36.595 --> 41:37.763
It'd be amazing.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.098
(all chuckling)

41:40.198 --> 41:42.400
He's kind of the black sheep.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.369
What about the rest of them?

41:45.771 --> 41:48.607
We're lambs.
(laughter)

41:48.707 --> 41:50.041
They're the lambs.

41:50.141 --> 41:51.610
In the name of the Father,

41:51.710 --> 41:53.812
and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

41:53.912 --> 41:56.848
ALL:
Bless us, O Lord,
and these thy gifts,

41:56.948 --> 41:58.917
which we are about
to receive from thy bounty,

41:59.017 --> 42:01.753
through Christ our Lord, amen.
