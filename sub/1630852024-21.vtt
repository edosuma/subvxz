00:02.437 --> 00:04.526
[Jughead] This may be
the last article I ever write.

00:04.569 --> 00:07.529
Either I might not be here
tomorrow or the town
might not be,

00:07.572 --> 00:10.097
or both of us might be gone.

00:10.140 --> 00:13.013
Our villain's name is
Percival Pickens.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.580
He's an immortal,
inter-dimensional sorcerer

00:15.624 --> 00:17.930
whose power is growing
by the hour.

00:17.974 --> 00:20.455
He wants to claim Riverdale
or destroy it,

00:20.498 --> 00:25.460
depending on the outcome
of a war that we're literally
pre-destined to lose.

00:25.503 --> 00:29.290
In advance of our battle,
Percival shut down
the town's borders.

00:29.333 --> 00:34.034
to keep people from leaving,
yes, but mostly to keep help
from arriving...

00:35.339 --> 00:38.299
but the truth was,
no one was coming.

00:38.342 --> 00:42.085
No one knew what was happening
outside of the town.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.957
Riverdale was a sealed-off
ecosystem.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.133
We were on our own.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.788
Not that we were giving up.

00:49.832 --> 00:53.227
We had Archie Andrews
who'd served two tours
of duty in the US Army,

00:53.270 --> 00:56.143
leading us,
planning our counter-offensive.

00:57.361 --> 00:58.971
Step one:

00:59.015 --> 01:00.973
Mitigate the sources
of Percival's power.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.280
It turns out,

01:03.324 --> 01:05.152
Pop's had been built
over a Hellmouth,

01:05.195 --> 01:07.328
which, ever since we moved
the diner, "uncorking it"

01:07.371 --> 01:10.113
has been feeding
Percival's strength.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.637
So we had to seal
and sanctify the Hellmouth

01:12.681 --> 01:16.119
with, in this case,
a sacred object
like the Holy Grail

01:16.163 --> 01:18.600
to catch the escaping darkness.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.779
Step two: Raid his outposts.

01:23.822 --> 01:27.130
Though, on this front,
Percival was a step
ahead of us.

01:27.174 --> 01:30.177
Yeah, he's cleared out
his whole shop.

01:30.220 --> 01:34.006
All those weapons
he's been collecting,
they're gone, Arch.

01:34.050 --> 01:37.140
Probably he's armed his troops
with him.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.534
-Yeah, but who are his troops?
-No clue.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.319
What do you want us to do?

01:42.363 --> 01:45.627
Burn it down.
So he can't use it
as a safe house.

01:46.236 --> 01:47.150
Copy.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.334
You're up.
Archie says torch it.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.075
With pleasure.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.306
[Jughead] We were preparing
for combat as best we could,

02:12.349 --> 02:14.960
given the horrific blow
we'd already been dealt.

02:15.004 --> 02:18.747
Tom Keller, Frank Andrews
and Alice Cooper
had been decapitated

02:18.790 --> 02:20.183
as prisoners of war.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.751
That bastard.

02:22.794 --> 02:24.274
He did it out of spite.

02:24.318 --> 02:27.799
To knock us off our heels
to win this stupid war of his.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.497
What are we supposed to do now?

02:29.540 --> 02:31.194
I just got you back,

02:31.238 --> 02:32.587
and now he executes Mom?

02:32.630 --> 02:35.242
He chops off her head
like a barbarian.

02:35.285 --> 02:36.765
It's horrible, Betty, I know.

02:36.808 --> 02:40.899
-But if it's any
comfort, I know--
-Don't.

02:40.943 --> 02:44.425
If you say,
"She's in a better place,"
I swear I will lose it.

02:44.468 --> 02:47.384
[sighs] Okay. I won't say it.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.691
But, Betty, please try not
to let this rage consume you--

02:49.734 --> 02:51.475
All I have is rage!

02:51.519 --> 02:53.173
Polly, I just want Mom back.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.218
Not in heaven
or wherever the hell she is.

02:55.262 --> 02:58.090
-Just here! With us!
-She will be soon.

02:58.134 --> 03:01.659
Cheryl will be able to
resurrect Mom and the others
with her Phoenix powers.

03:01.703 --> 03:04.009
How? We don't have
their bodies.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.837
She can't do anything
without them.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.362
Well, have faith, Betty.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.102
Oh, screw faith.

03:13.149 --> 03:14.716
I... I just can't believe it.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.197
I can't believe my dad...

03:18.589 --> 03:21.331
He was under
Percival's control,
he didn't deserve--

03:21.375 --> 03:22.680
Of course not, Kevin.

03:24.552 --> 03:25.857
It's still not over.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.424
[knocking on door]

03:27.468 --> 03:28.817
It's okay.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.253
We thought after everything
you've been through,

03:30.297 --> 03:31.820
you could use
a little extra support.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.390
-Hey.
-Oh.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.827
I slipped back in right before
the borders closed.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.307
I'm so sorry, Kev.

03:43.658 --> 03:47.314
Archie, I got your message.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.143
How are you doing?

03:51.187 --> 03:54.364
I couldn't sleep.
Can't keep any food down.

03:54.408 --> 03:58.368
I meant, how are you doing
about your Uncle Frank?

04:02.067 --> 04:03.330
Frank was a soldier,

04:04.418 --> 04:06.420
he knew the risks of war.

04:06.463 --> 04:10.467
If he were still here,
he'd be telling me to focus
on the living, the fight.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.993
Okay, then. How can I help?

04:15.037 --> 04:18.258
I've got Cheryl and Heather
looking for a spell
to block the energy

04:18.301 --> 04:20.303
Percival might be absorbing
from the comet.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.697
Percival doesn't need to get
any stronger, that's for sure.

04:22.740 --> 04:26.396
I sent word to him,
and he agreed to a meeting
at the Babylonium.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.443
To establish some rules
of engagement.

04:29.486 --> 04:32.272
If you're willing,
I'd love for you
to come with me.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.490
I'm going to need
an expert negotiator,

04:33.534 --> 04:35.362
and there is no better
dealmaker than you.

04:35.405 --> 04:40.541
[chuckles] Of course, Archie.
When do we go?

04:40.584 --> 04:42.107
Right after we meet up
with the others.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.807
[Betty] This is a mistake.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.374
You're walking into
the lion's den.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.941
We have to do it.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.943
We're not just setting
parameters for the war.

04:51.987 --> 04:54.990
We're trying to get Alice,
Frank and Tom back.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.339
Negotiate their return.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.862
Would Percival
really allow that?

04:57.906 --> 05:00.387
And what crazy demands
would he make in return?

05:00.430 --> 05:02.214
-Baby Anthony--
-Hell, no.

05:02.258 --> 05:04.173
We're not going there, Toni.

05:04.216 --> 05:08.177
But there are a few things
we should discuss offering him.

05:08.220 --> 05:11.441
Like, maybe...
half of Riverdale.

05:11.485 --> 05:12.834
What?

05:12.877 --> 05:14.966
And go back to a Northside
and Southside again? No.

05:15.010 --> 05:18.535
At the risk of sounding like
a broken record,
Percival is but one.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.102
Let me go all super-nova
on his ass

05:20.145 --> 05:21.321
and burn him
off the face of the earth

05:21.364 --> 05:23.148
like the pimple he is. Please.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.063
It's too risky, Cheryl.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.761
I've seen the future,

05:26.804 --> 05:30.547
a possible future.
We are trying to avoid
the apocalypse.

05:30.591 --> 05:33.115
You going nuclear
on Percival might be
the very thing

05:33.158 --> 05:34.464
that destroys Riverdale.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.423
Look, I'll get us
the best deal that I can,

05:36.466 --> 05:39.556
but we have to assume
that Percival
is going to demand

05:39.600 --> 05:43.299
our complete
and immediate surrender.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.083
Are we willing to go there?

05:46.389 --> 05:49.479
And, if not, are we ready
to say goodbye

05:49.523 --> 05:51.873
to those we've lost? For good?

05:58.793 --> 06:00.664
Hey, guys, um...

06:00.708 --> 06:05.408
look, I didn't want to say this
in front of everyone, but, um,

06:05.452 --> 06:08.150
you know how I saw
all of those different
scenarios play out

06:08.193 --> 06:10.457
when I was looking for a way
to beat Percival?

06:10.500 --> 06:14.112
Yeah. Only two out
of 1,000 plus were
successful, right?

06:14.156 --> 06:16.637
Well, one of them
involved the two of you

06:16.680 --> 06:18.378
going to the Babylonium
and meeting with Percival.

06:19.988 --> 06:23.731
And what exactly did we do
in that scenario?

06:23.774 --> 06:27.430
[Tabitha] Percival's immortal
but not invulnerable.

06:27.474 --> 06:31.303
So you shot him point blank.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.133
Twyla Twyst.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.442
I'm confused.

06:39.486 --> 06:43.098
No disrespect but didn't
all the Ghoulies die?

06:43.141 --> 06:44.316
Who are these people?

06:46.580 --> 06:48.886
Take a closer look, doll face.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.888
They're your friends
and neighbors

06:50.932 --> 06:53.021
under our control.

06:57.895 --> 07:01.421
Maybe you shouldn't have
blown up his ghost train,
ya think?

07:03.771 --> 07:07.035
Ms. Lodge, you should know
that I have filters
in my nostrils,

07:07.078 --> 07:09.341
and my body is coated
in a special sealant.

07:09.385 --> 07:12.083
So any kind of venomous
attack by you will fail.

07:12.127 --> 07:15.478
Luckily, I'm just here
to negotiate a way out
of this mess.

07:15.522 --> 07:16.871
Hm.

07:16.914 --> 07:20.048
And the first thing we want
is... our dead back.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.310
In exchange for what?

07:24.052 --> 07:26.881
Me. I'll be your prisoner.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.230
You can do whatever
you want to me.

07:28.273 --> 07:29.840
Starve me. Chain me up.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.668
-Sounds great.
-[Archie] Force me
out of the final battle.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.541
And need I remind you,
Archie's still invulnerable,

07:34.584 --> 07:37.195
so that's got to be
worth something to you.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.371
Do you know what this is?

07:39.415 --> 07:43.550
This is a mace
forged in the fiery pits
of Asgard,

07:43.593 --> 07:47.162
strong enough
to break anything,
even forged skin.

07:47.205 --> 07:48.424
Like the daggers of Megiddo.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.514
I call it my great equalizer.

07:51.558 --> 07:55.475
And it's the reason
I don't have to make deals
with any of you.

07:55.518 --> 07:58.173
What if we split Riverdale
in half,

07:58.216 --> 08:00.436
along the former Northside
Southside line?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.090
Mmm.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.353
My dear Ms. Lodge,
here's what I want.

08:04.396 --> 08:05.615
It's what I've wanted
from the beginning.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.749
My revenge on your friends.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.142
And the town of Riverdale
under my complete control,

08:11.186 --> 08:12.883
why would I accept
anything else?

08:12.927 --> 08:14.494
So, surrender.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.496
Turn over your property,
revoke your town's charter

08:16.539 --> 08:19.107
and pledge
your undying allegiance to me

08:19.150 --> 08:20.543
on your knees.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.632
Yeah, we talked about that.
All of us.

08:23.415 --> 08:24.634
And we are not surrendering.

08:25.722 --> 08:26.941
I tried.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.509
You know, Percival,
before you came along,

08:29.552 --> 08:34.470
Riverdale had another
great tormentor... my father.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.429
He spent years
trying to destroy this town,

08:37.473 --> 08:40.302
but ultimately,
I put a hit on him.

08:40.345 --> 08:43.348
My only regret is that
I didn't kill him myself.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.528
Oops. Hm.

08:50.181 --> 08:54.185
[inhales] The time
for negotiation is over.

08:54.229 --> 08:58.407
We shall meet again tonight
for the final act.

08:59.756 --> 09:02.629
8:30 at the Chock'lit Shoppe
work for you?

09:02.672 --> 09:04.587
Wherever that is these days.

09:04.631 --> 09:08.025
For war or your surrender.
But be assured.

09:08.069 --> 09:13.291
If you submit to my authority,
I shall be merciful
and generous.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.773
To that end, take your dead.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.514
Mourn them, bury them.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.082
Perhaps this gesture will prove
that not everything

09:21.125 --> 09:23.258
need be bloodshed
and destruction.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.740
[Jughead] Confused
and suspicious,

09:26.783 --> 09:29.612
Veronica and Archie headed back
down to the casino floor...

09:29.656 --> 09:33.485
where, sure enough,
three caskets were
waiting for them.

09:35.444 --> 09:36.619
Are you getting soft
on me, Boss?

09:38.012 --> 09:39.709
Why give them what they want?

09:39.753 --> 09:42.277
Oh, Twyla. How little you know
of true warfare.

09:42.320 --> 09:47.717
Mr. Andrews and his meddlesome
associates scuttled
my plans for the dead.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.719
It's only right
that I pay them back in kind.

09:54.550 --> 09:57.640
[Jughead] Archie and Veronica
brought the dead
back to the El Royale...

09:58.685 --> 10:00.338
back to their loved ones.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.123
Cheryl, are you sure
this is going to work?

10:02.776 --> 10:04.255
It should.

10:04.299 --> 10:07.563
But I need to conjure
my Phoenix powers in the mines.

10:07.607 --> 10:11.349
Otherwise, everything here
will be toast.

10:11.393 --> 10:12.481
-Guys--
-Wait.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.615
I want to see my mom.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.007
If Cheryl's spell doesn't work,

10:17.051 --> 10:19.531
I want to feel like
I at least got to say goodbye.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.323
[tense music playing]

10:28.366 --> 10:29.629
[coffin slams shut]

10:32.022 --> 10:33.763
Bee, what is that?

10:35.852 --> 10:36.810
Is it not her?

10:40.770 --> 10:41.728
[gasps]

10:42.729 --> 10:43.773
No, it's her.

10:43.817 --> 10:44.774
What is it then?

10:45.993 --> 10:47.168
Her head's missing.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.305
Oh, my God.

10:58.745 --> 10:59.833
Cheryl...

11:01.748 --> 11:04.664
The bodies need to be whole.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.755
Or the resurrection won't work.

11:08.798 --> 11:12.323
[Jughead] It was
psychological warfare
at its most diabolical.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.412
Percival was twisting
the knife,

11:14.456 --> 11:15.805
making us relive the death

11:15.849 --> 11:18.199
of our loved ones
all over again.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.602
Are you sure
you don't want one?

11:31.865 --> 11:33.780
Jughead, you need
to leave Riverdale.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.783
Like, right now.

11:36.826 --> 11:40.482
You don't survive
the final battle
or did you forget?

11:40.525 --> 11:41.701
No, I didn't forget.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.964
But as you said,

11:44.007 --> 11:45.792
if there's even
an outside chance
that we beat Percival,

11:45.835 --> 11:47.968
then my mental abilities
are going to be key.

11:48.011 --> 11:50.971
You can open up a portal
to literally anywhere.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.320
Tabitha...

11:54.017 --> 11:55.279
I'm not going to leave you

11:56.106 --> 11:57.673
or anyone else.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.763
I came back from the dead
for this.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.548
And if it means
going up against Percival
mano-a-mano,

12:03.592 --> 12:04.941
then I'm going to do it.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.252
I knew you'd say that.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.863
And you said that
in every scenario

12:15.299 --> 12:16.605
that I visited.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.173
But I couldn't...

12:22.219 --> 12:24.395
-I had to try.
-I know.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.486
That's why I love you.

12:32.447 --> 12:33.578
I love you, too.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.975
[Jughead] Meanwhile,
unbeknownst to us,

12:39.019 --> 12:41.848
Percival was preparing
to launch a ghoulish
stealth attack

12:41.891 --> 12:45.242
in direct violation
of his agreed upon
terms with Archie.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.853
[chanting in Latin]

13:00.736 --> 13:03.130
So, Arch, what's your plan?

13:03.173 --> 13:05.349
How's this battle
going to go down?

13:05.393 --> 13:07.917
Given everything, Reg,
I think we should
leave the houses.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.355
We're sitting ducks out here.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.271
So you're saying
we bail and run?

13:14.881 --> 13:17.971
Not run. Hide.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.974
In Fox Forest. Let Percival
and his army come to us.

13:21.017 --> 13:24.412
Will that work? I mean,
with how powerful he is.

13:24.455 --> 13:25.848
He's got magic.
We've got Cheryl.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.937
He's got telepathy.
We've got Jughead.

13:27.981 --> 13:30.026
The rest of us?
We get down and dirty.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.636
And we take out his troops.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.335
Smart.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.816
Hey, bro, can you grab me
another brewski?

13:39.209 --> 13:40.820
Yeah, sure. I'll be right back.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.825
[ominous music plays]

13:47.348 --> 13:48.958
[dog growling]

13:53.006 --> 13:54.485
I'm sorry, Polly.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.444
I know that you mean well,
I just can't...

13:57.271 --> 13:58.925
I just want to be alone, okay?

14:01.623 --> 14:02.885
Yes. I love you too.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.757
Okay, bye.

14:07.672 --> 14:08.891
[objects shattering]

14:12.634 --> 14:13.896
[knocking on door]

14:18.292 --> 14:19.902
Who's there?

14:19.946 --> 14:22.339
[Abuelita] It's me,
mi nieta, tu abuelite...

14:23.471 --> 14:25.299
[in English]
Can I please come inside?

14:29.085 --> 14:31.914
Cheryl, I've checked various
astronomical texts

14:31.958 --> 14:34.264
for any and all references
to Bailey's Comet.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.398
And we have been making
an incorrect assumption
about it.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.009
Pray tell, what do you mean?

14:40.053 --> 14:42.403
[Jason] Cher-Cher.
Want to play?

14:44.100 --> 14:48.017
Jay-Jay, Heather and I are
a little busy right now,

14:48.061 --> 14:49.932
but maybe later?

14:49.976 --> 14:52.761
Why are you always
so mean to me?

14:54.458 --> 14:55.851
[Cheryl] Mean to you?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.723
-Jay-Jay--
-Cheryl, something's wrong.

14:59.550 --> 15:00.943
-[groans]
-[screaming]

15:00.987 --> 15:02.510
Go, go, go!

15:06.122 --> 15:07.036
[Archie] Reg?

15:08.037 --> 15:09.647
[bottles clinking]

15:10.910 --> 15:11.736
Bingo?

15:11.780 --> 15:13.608
[Reggie] You know what, bro?

15:13.651 --> 15:16.611
-[groans]
-You're not that smart.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.009
-This is one of Percival's
magic daggers.
-[gasping]

15:23.923 --> 15:25.925
[groaning]

15:25.968 --> 15:26.969
[rummaging]

15:35.935 --> 15:36.936
Hey!

15:38.111 --> 15:38.981
[panting]

15:40.374 --> 15:41.505
Glen?

15:41.549 --> 15:43.725
[whirring]

15:43.768 --> 15:46.423
[woman]
Please, mi nieta,let me in.

15:46.467 --> 15:49.165
[Veronica] Abuelita,
why didn't you call
to say you were coming?

15:49.209 --> 15:51.472
Because I want this
to be a surprise.

15:52.603 --> 15:53.778
[gun fires]

15:59.175 --> 16:00.046
[Veronica yelps]

16:10.273 --> 16:12.101
What? What is it?

16:13.320 --> 16:15.017
Something's wrong.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.977
My sense of the divine
is tingling.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.109
-What?
-It's a heightened awareness.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.024
I'm Riverdale's
guardian angel, Jug.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.548
And one of the souls
of the town is dying.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.769
[both grunting]

16:30.859 --> 16:32.513
[breathing heavily]

16:35.559 --> 16:38.214
[Abuelita] You killed my son!
Murderer!

16:38.258 --> 16:39.520
[gunshot]

16:40.390 --> 16:41.652
[Jason] Marco...

16:43.785 --> 16:45.134
Come on, Cher-Cher.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.006
[Cheryl] Polo.

16:54.622 --> 16:55.971
[sputters]

16:56.015 --> 16:57.059
-[grunts]
-[whirring]

17:06.155 --> 17:07.069
Come get some.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.728
[glass shattering]

17:24.217 --> 17:27.524
[Abuelita] You're going
to burn in hell for everything
that you've done.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.924
Abuelita,I don't know
what you've heard,

17:35.967 --> 17:38.753
but before you do anything
you regret, let me explain.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.980
I'll start with the neurotoxin
I coated the doorknob with.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.113
[exhales] It won't kill you,

17:52.375 --> 17:55.074
but it has paralyzed you.

17:55.117 --> 17:58.164
Don't worry, the effects
of it should wear off soon.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.688
Archie?

18:01.428 --> 18:03.125
[grunting]

18:10.263 --> 18:11.177
[both grunting]

18:15.268 --> 18:17.574
[groaning]

18:20.534 --> 18:21.665
[groans]

18:23.580 --> 18:24.929
[groaning]

18:30.587 --> 18:32.633
-Marco...
-[Cheryl] Polo.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.898
Jason, this isn't you.

18:36.941 --> 18:39.292
You're being controlled
by an evil sorcerer.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.164
We're playing a game.

18:42.991 --> 18:45.167
[Cheryl] Jay, I'm so sorry.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.300
I never should have
brought you back to life.

18:47.778 --> 18:48.953
It was a mistake.

18:53.393 --> 18:54.655
Please forgive me.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.223
[crying]

18:57.266 --> 18:58.615
[screaming]

19:05.274 --> 19:07.146
Archie! Oh, my God.

19:08.669 --> 19:12.020
Tabitha... am I dying again?

19:12.716 --> 19:13.935
Not if we can help it.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.383
I don't know what happened,
mi nieta.

19:28.732 --> 19:31.431
I just heard this voice inside
that told me

19:31.474 --> 19:35.913
that I should come here
and punish you,

19:35.957 --> 19:38.612
for killing Heraldo, your papa.

19:39.961 --> 19:44.313
Then I don't remember
what happened after that.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.228
It's not your fault, Abuelita.

19:47.969 --> 19:52.408
I believe a very bad person
sent you here to hurt me.

19:52.452 --> 19:55.368
I was getting anxious,
so I thought I'd come
and check on you.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.981
What... what happened here?

20:03.419 --> 20:05.595
I'm not really sure.

20:05.639 --> 20:09.860
I think it was Percival
who launched some kind
of crazy stealth attack

20:09.904 --> 20:11.384
using my old boss, Glen

20:11.427 --> 20:15.692
as some stitched-together,
patchwork man.

20:17.346 --> 20:20.393
His body parts are twitching
in the garage.

20:23.526 --> 20:27.400
Heather, I feel terrible
that my brother
did this to you.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.532
Sabrina was right.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.099
I shouldn't have
resurrected him.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.971
Don't apologize.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.670
Your brother was clearly
possessed by Percival.

20:37.323 --> 20:38.324
It wasn't his fault.

20:40.195 --> 20:45.809
Before Jay-Jay pierced you
with an arrow,

20:45.853 --> 20:49.900
I believe you were about
to tell me something
about the comet?

20:49.944 --> 20:54.340
Oh. Merciful Hecate, yes.

20:54.383 --> 20:55.732
[Archie] This is unbelievable.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.561
All my stab wounds are gone.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.520
Or does it make complete sense?

21:00.563 --> 21:02.652
Bingo has healing properties,

21:02.696 --> 21:04.915
as does his saliva, clearly.

21:04.959 --> 21:08.963
Ergo, him licking you
regenerated all of that
torn tissue.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.878
Healed your wounds.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.577
How ya feeling, Reg?

21:14.621 --> 21:16.318
I'm so sorry, bro.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.364
I don't know what happened.

21:18.407 --> 21:22.106
I was with my dad and suddenly
I heard Percival's voice
in my head,

21:22.150 --> 21:26.850
telling me to find out
what your plan was
and to then kill you.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.551
Toni, what's up?

21:31.594 --> 21:33.422
Fangs, Kevin,
Moose and I came up
with a plan.

21:34.554 --> 21:35.903
A crazy-ass plan.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.084
There's a saying
we Serpents have.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.868
Always kill a baby snake
in its egg

21:44.912 --> 21:46.522
so it doesn't grow up
to bite you.

21:46.566 --> 21:49.177
That's exactly what Percival's
trying to do with Baby Anthony.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.222
The only true threat
to someone who's immortal

21:51.266 --> 21:53.399
is someone else
who's also immortal.

21:53.442 --> 21:57.098
Anthony can hold someone
like Percival in checkmate
for centuries, if need be.

21:57.141 --> 21:59.056
Even as everyone else
dies out around them.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.928
The last man standing
is the winner.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.539
Okay, what are you
thinking, Toni?

22:03.583 --> 22:05.715
Simple. We kick some
Ghoulie ass.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.849
The Serpents and I break
into the Babylonium
with Baby Anthony,

22:08.892 --> 22:11.678
who Percival is terrified of.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.332
We bust up his army.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.898
And then we look for
those missing heads.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.161
I mean, we know
they've got to be
in there somewhere.

22:17.205 --> 22:19.250
And then Baby Anthony
can take out Percival.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.384
I... hear you.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.908
But Toni, Anthony's a baby.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.780
Right now he is.

22:26.823 --> 22:30.218
But we've had the privilege
of seeing Baby Anthony
in the future,

22:30.261 --> 22:32.394
and he's a warrior, Archie.

22:32.438 --> 22:35.179
So what if Tabitha
speeds up time?

22:35.223 --> 22:37.051
Just for Baby Anthony?

22:37.094 --> 22:38.095
Ages him up.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.575
We would miss his childhood,

22:39.619 --> 22:42.404
but that's a sacrifice
I'm willing to make.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.145
Percival would never
see him coming.

22:44.188 --> 22:47.627
Damn, that's some
Looperlevel crap.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.977
In Rivervale, I created
a time-loop.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.414
I might be able to create
a time-bubble
around Baby Anthony,

22:52.458 --> 22:55.983
in which I accelerate
his and only his aging.

22:56.026 --> 22:58.377
I mean, it could actually work.

23:01.945 --> 23:04.295
[electrical buzzing]

23:14.915 --> 23:16.046
Did it work?

23:18.484 --> 23:20.224
It did.

23:20.268 --> 23:23.837
Anthony... are you
in there, son?

23:25.621 --> 23:28.058
Yeah... I'm here.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.933
So are we kicking
Percival's ass, or what?

23:36.458 --> 23:37.285
Yeah.

23:38.286 --> 23:39.592
I got the weapon for it.

23:41.376 --> 23:43.509
Percival's dagger.
If it'll hurt me,
it'll hurt him.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.469
[Fangs] Serpents, remember,

23:47.513 --> 23:51.255
we're not trying
to kill the Ghoulies,
just subdue them.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.475
They're our neighbors.
They're being mind-controlled.

23:53.519 --> 23:57.044
We seize command of the casino
and clear a path to Percival.

23:57.087 --> 23:59.133
-Got it?
-[all] Yeah!

23:59.176 --> 24:01.135
[Jughead] You've seen
all the scenarios
play out, Tabitha.

24:01.178 --> 24:04.921
Do you really think
this Serpent surprise attack
is gonna work?

24:04.965 --> 24:08.490
I mean, the Battle
of the Babylonium
is one of two possible ways

24:08.534 --> 24:09.796
we beat Percival.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.886
So maybe, maybe not.

24:12.929 --> 24:15.584
Like they say,
hope for the best,

24:15.628 --> 24:17.456
prepare for the worst.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.980
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you
about that.

24:21.721 --> 24:26.595
Whatever happens to me,
don't mourn, okay?

24:26.639 --> 24:29.468
I want you to chase
your dreams.
Live your life.

24:29.511 --> 24:32.514
Jughead, how can you be
so casual about this?

24:32.558 --> 24:35.212
I am choosing to look at it
like this.

24:35.256 --> 24:37.388
I've lived a wonderful life.

24:37.432 --> 24:40.827
I've fallen in love.
I published a book.

24:40.870 --> 24:42.350
I've gone
to an alternate universe

24:42.393 --> 24:44.570
and met other versions
of myself.

24:44.613 --> 24:46.528
There's not many people
that can say that
they've done that.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.356
Alternate universes...

24:48.399 --> 24:50.010
Oh, my God,
I don't believe this.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.229
Jughead, you need
to open up another portal.
To Rivervale.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.493
-Like, right now.
-Back to River-- Why?

24:54.536 --> 24:58.192
Yes. All of those scenarios
in which we lost
against Percival,

24:58.235 --> 25:00.542
those happened in Riverdale,

25:00.586 --> 25:04.111
but we have access
to an alternate universe now.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.766
I have some maje tea to spill
about Bailey's Comet, Archie.

25:06.809 --> 25:10.073
Did you find a spell to keep
Percival from absorbing
more power from it?

25:10.117 --> 25:12.554
No, but that may be moot
at this point.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.774
Turns out Bailey's Comet
isn't arriving tonight.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.993
It's passing over Riverdale
tomorrow night.

25:17.037 --> 25:18.952
What? Percival's been
talking about,

25:18.995 --> 25:21.650
how this comet will give him
the ultimate advantage.

25:21.694 --> 25:23.652
Well, we've set up
Nana's telescope,

25:23.696 --> 25:26.612
so once it's dark out,
we'll be able to track
its progress in real time.

25:27.264 --> 25:28.657
Okay, cool.

25:28.701 --> 25:30.441
And with any luck,
Toni and the Serpents

25:30.485 --> 25:32.661
will have ended things
before the zero hour.

25:32.705 --> 25:33.532
Yep.

25:43.237 --> 25:45.369
[indistinct chatter]

25:45.413 --> 25:47.763
I'm worried about
the army, Boss.

25:47.807 --> 25:48.938
What is that, my dear?

25:48.982 --> 25:50.070
You're controlling them.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.202
But they're newbies.

25:52.246 --> 25:53.987
Oh, Twyla.

25:54.030 --> 25:57.381
As if my victory hinges
on those feeble misfits
down there.

25:57.425 --> 26:02.125
That band of Ghoulie-surrogates
are simply shields
to be shattered.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.563
Cannon fodder.
Pawns to be sacrificed.

26:05.433 --> 26:06.608
As are you, for that matter.

26:08.349 --> 26:10.046
You're really messed up
in the head, you know that?

26:10.090 --> 26:11.570
[banging on door]

26:13.702 --> 26:16.662
Why don't you go
and investigate that,
Twyla, my love?

26:16.705 --> 26:19.926
See what Big Bad Wolf
is banging on my door?

26:19.969 --> 26:21.318
[banging continues]

26:27.542 --> 26:29.022
Don't open that door!

26:31.111 --> 26:33.200
[all clamoring]

26:35.942 --> 26:37.160
Topaz...

26:38.684 --> 26:40.337
Don't even try it, bitch!

26:41.991 --> 26:43.471
[screaming]

26:52.132 --> 26:53.394
[gun cocking]

26:54.090 --> 26:55.265
-[gun fires]
-[groans]

26:57.790 --> 26:58.747
And who are you supposed to be?

27:00.357 --> 27:02.098
I'm your match.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.665
I'm the guy that kills you.

27:03.709 --> 27:04.666
I don't think so.

27:04.710 --> 27:05.711
[gun fires]

27:09.062 --> 27:11.673
[scoffing] Now do you know
who I am?

27:13.849 --> 27:16.417
-Anthony.
-That's right.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.724
Like you,
that gun won't kill me.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.682
But this blade
will hurt you plenty.

27:29.082 --> 27:31.127
[speaking Latin]

27:43.966 --> 27:46.229
I just got word
from inside the Babylonium.

27:46.273 --> 27:50.277
The good news is,
Toni and the Serpents took
the Ghoulies off the board.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.105
Bracing for the other shoe...

27:52.148 --> 27:54.890
Percival escaped
and trapped them
inside the building

27:54.934 --> 27:57.153
with some kind of
sealing spell.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.851
[sighs] And there she drops.

27:58.894 --> 28:00.287
My God, is everyone okay?

28:00.330 --> 28:01.767
[Archie] Kevin's injured,

28:01.810 --> 28:03.769
but they think they've got
the bleeding under control.

28:03.812 --> 28:07.686
And any sign
of the missing craniums?

28:07.729 --> 28:11.080
Not yet, but they're turning
the place upside down.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.299
[footsteps approaching]

28:14.214 --> 28:15.563
Where the hell
have you guys been?

28:16.303 --> 28:17.565
Our parallel universe.

28:18.871 --> 28:21.438
And we have a plan.

28:21.482 --> 28:23.571
So Jughead opened up a portal
to Rivervale,

28:23.614 --> 28:28.402
and I went through
and started exploring
different future scenarios.

28:28.445 --> 28:30.752
-Did we win in those?
-Our odds were better.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.363
In Rivervale,
we had a fighting chance,
at least.

28:33.407 --> 28:37.541
Okay, not that I want
to hear the answer,
but why is that, exactly?

28:37.585 --> 28:39.500
The energies
are different there.

28:39.543 --> 28:42.024
The supernatural exists there.

28:42.068 --> 28:45.375
These different variables
affect all probable outcomes.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.160
I knew I shouldn't have asked.

28:47.203 --> 28:50.554
We have an idea, though,
that might beat Percival.
It's a long-shot.

28:50.598 --> 28:51.860
But for it to work,

28:51.904 --> 28:54.471
the final battle
has to take place at Pop's...

28:54.515 --> 28:56.647
at the diner's
original location.

28:56.691 --> 28:58.258
How would that happen?

28:58.301 --> 28:59.825
Well, we'd need
to move the diner
back to where it was.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.261
That would take days.

29:01.304 --> 29:03.306
We have two hours
until this battle.

29:03.350 --> 29:06.745
Well, the same way
I was able to speed up time
for Baby Anthony,

29:06.788 --> 29:10.052
I might be able to speed up
us moving Pop's.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.491
[Jughead] Which is what
Tabitha did.

29:15.275 --> 29:16.755
She formed a time bubble

29:16.798 --> 29:19.453
around all of us
at the El Royale.

29:19.496 --> 29:22.935
While some of us
loaded out the gym,
the diner was rebuilt,

29:22.978 --> 29:25.546
matching the original exactly.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.896
Then everything was moved back
into place,

29:27.940 --> 29:30.856
brick by brick, piece by piece.

29:30.899 --> 29:34.990
Man, even in hyper-speed,
moving blows.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.253
[Jughead] Once everything
was back where it belonged,

29:37.297 --> 29:42.781
we all went to our respective
houses to rest,
regroup and recharge.

29:42.824 --> 29:45.827
And then,
it was the appointed hour.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.698
Time for our final stand.

29:48.177 --> 29:49.918
[crackling]

29:52.051 --> 29:53.922
[Percival] What an interesting
choice of weapon.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.927
Oh. And you brought
reinforcements.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.537
Good.

30:00.581 --> 30:03.236
I always knew
it would come down
to you and your cohorts.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.411
Where's your back-up?

30:05.238 --> 30:07.066
Comet's a day away.

30:07.109 --> 30:10.373
Yeah, but it's been
bolstering me for weeks.

30:10.417 --> 30:13.376
[both grunting]

30:27.564 --> 30:29.479
[grunting continues]

30:31.090 --> 30:32.918
First the end
of Archie Andrews.

30:32.961 --> 30:35.921
Then the end of Riverdale,
as you've known it.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.792
And I'm so glad
your friends will...

30:38.967 --> 30:39.968
Wait, where's...

30:41.970 --> 30:42.971
Where did they go?

30:43.015 --> 30:43.972
[groans]

30:46.192 --> 30:49.978
As far as this being
the end of Riverdale,
I wouldn't hold your breath.

31:08.170 --> 31:09.650
This is our town, bitch.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.961
You're outnumbered, Percival.
You've lost.

31:18.311 --> 31:21.705
Now... will you surrender?

31:22.532 --> 31:23.925
[Percival laughs maliciously]

31:26.188 --> 31:27.059
Never.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.887
I never surrender.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.063
I'm a magic man, Mr. Andrews.

31:31.106 --> 31:34.414
And I've always got
another trick up my sleeve.

31:34.457 --> 31:36.895
And I'll be bathing
in your blood by morning.

31:37.808 --> 31:40.768
[chanting in Latin]

31:50.952 --> 31:52.954
[Jughead] Percival turned
our powers against us.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.043
He poisoned Veronica.

31:55.087 --> 31:55.957
Excuse me.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.437
[Betty] Archie?

31:57.480 --> 31:58.655
-[Jughead] He blinded Betty.
-[Cheryl] Veronica?

31:58.699 --> 32:00.527
[Jughead] He froze Cheryl.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.094
[laughs wickedly]

32:02.137 --> 32:03.704
[Jughead] He turned Archie
into an iron statue,

32:03.747 --> 32:05.924
and Reggie
into a life-size dummy.

32:07.273 --> 32:08.404
Where are you guys?

32:11.103 --> 32:13.409
[Jughead] And then,
it was just me.

32:13.453 --> 32:14.628
[Betty] Guys?

32:19.546 --> 32:20.851
[bell chiming]

32:27.032 --> 32:27.902
Ah.

32:29.077 --> 32:30.078
Mr. Jones.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.909
The last line of defense.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.564
[Jughead] And our ghosts
are here to bear witness.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.657
Good of you to dress
for the occasion.

32:47.487 --> 32:49.576
And what do we have here?

32:49.619 --> 32:51.099
I was thinking,
let's play a game.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.104
Winner... takes the soul
of Riverdale.

32:57.018 --> 33:01.501
And the loser...
gets lobotomized.

33:01.544 --> 33:02.981
You know, I've been
looking forward to this.

33:04.504 --> 33:07.420
A test of our mental prowess.

33:08.464 --> 33:10.945
I must say,
I admire your hubris.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.643
And while your
psychic abilities
have been impressive,

33:15.080 --> 33:17.386
you'll never break
into my mind.

33:17.430 --> 33:18.518
We'll see about that.

33:19.910 --> 33:21.825
I'm a believer
in beginner's luck.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.090
May the best man win.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.788
And may the other's memories
and cognitive abilities

33:27.831 --> 33:30.008
be shredded
like so much cabbage.

33:35.752 --> 33:37.015
[thunderclap]

34:03.171 --> 34:04.825
[lock clicks open]

34:04.868 --> 34:06.087
[ominous music playing]

34:10.352 --> 34:11.614
[music increases in tempo]

34:30.546 --> 34:33.158
Damn. That was easy for you,
wasn't it?

34:33.201 --> 34:38.293
Well, I have broken
into your mind before,
if you remember.

34:38.337 --> 34:41.122
Oh, I remember.
That's how we came up
with this plan.

34:43.342 --> 34:44.691
Plan?

34:44.734 --> 34:47.128
Well, "plan." "Trick."
"Trap." Take your pick.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.305
We beat you.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.090
While you were in here
inside my mind,

34:52.133 --> 34:54.222
you left your body vulnerable
to my friends.

34:54.266 --> 34:57.269
[scoffs] Mr. Jones.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.749
All of your friends
are incapacitated.

35:00.576 --> 35:02.274
And didn't Ms. Tate tell you,

35:02.317 --> 35:05.146
you cannot and will not beat me
in Riverdale...

35:05.538 --> 35:06.713
ever.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.149
I know.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.369
But these are
different friends.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.980
And you're not in Riverdale
anymore, Percy.

35:21.249 --> 35:25.035
So, how do those
stab wounds feel?

35:25.514 --> 35:27.864
Hm. [groans]

35:40.355 --> 35:41.356
How?

35:42.618 --> 35:44.664
I defeated them already.

35:44.707 --> 35:47.188
Oh, no,
these are different friends.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.277
These are my Rivervale friends.

35:49.321 --> 35:52.324
It's confusing, I know,
but when you stepped
through the doors of Pop's,

35:52.367 --> 35:54.195
you walked through
one of my portals

35:55.414 --> 35:57.329
into Rivervale's Pop's.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.592
[breathing weakly]
Doesn't matter.

35:59.635 --> 36:04.074
Doesn't matter who they are,
or where I am,
you can't kill me.

36:05.815 --> 36:06.903
I'm immortal.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.819
Right now you are.

36:09.863 --> 36:14.041
But 440 years ago,
before you made your deal
with the Devil,

36:15.260 --> 36:19.438
-you were very, very mortal.
-[chuckles softly]

36:19.481 --> 36:20.308
[Tabitha] Mm!

36:23.398 --> 36:24.356
[bell chiming]

36:25.748 --> 36:26.880
[grunts]

36:26.923 --> 36:28.925
[Tabitha] Welcome back to 1580.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.318
[Mr. Cypher] Ms. Tate...

36:30.362 --> 36:32.102
what have you brought me
this fine evening?

36:32.146 --> 36:34.017
[Tabitha] Mr. Cypher,
an old friend.

36:34.061 --> 36:38.892
We softened him up a bit,
but he's still dying
to reconnect with you.

36:41.373 --> 36:45.333
If I'm not immortal,
then I haven't sold you
my soul yet, have I?

36:47.205 --> 36:51.557
In fact, this contract,
which exists in perpetuity,

36:51.600 --> 36:55.387
in all continuities,
into the past
as well as the future,

36:56.126 --> 36:57.345
suggests otherwise.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.175
Oh, don't look at me.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.351
I'm terrible
with time paradoxes.

37:03.395 --> 37:06.702
But maybe, that's just
how things roll in Rivervale.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.271
If I can't have Riverdale,
then no one will.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.316
Okay.

37:12.534 --> 37:15.233
[muttering in Latin]

37:15.276 --> 37:18.018
Mr. Cypher, get him
the hell out of here.

37:18.888 --> 37:20.150
You know, I believe I will.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.287
[chuckles softly]

37:32.380 --> 37:33.381
[bell chiming]

37:40.736 --> 37:42.999
So... it's over?

37:44.349 --> 37:46.002
It's over.

37:46.046 --> 37:48.353
We did it. We... we beat him.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.186
[laughing]

37:58.667 --> 38:00.365
[indistinct shouting]

38:04.499 --> 38:07.807
[Jughead] But there was still
important work to be done.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.766
After Percival's death,
the casino was
no longer sealed.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.508
More good news...

38:13.552 --> 38:15.293
Toni and Fangs
found the missing heads.

38:15.336 --> 38:18.339
They were, naturally,
in a fridge

38:18.383 --> 38:20.036
in the Babylonium's kitchen.

38:23.736 --> 38:25.825
Betty supervised Dr. Curdle

38:25.868 --> 38:28.349
as he re-attached the heads
to the corpses'
respective bodies.

38:30.003 --> 38:33.485
At which point,
Cheryl brought our loved
ones back to life.

38:33.528 --> 38:36.270
And then she returned
to Thornhill.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.316
There was one last surprise
waiting for her.

38:39.665 --> 38:40.840
Heather.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.235
Oh, no.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.629
What's the matter?

38:47.673 --> 38:49.762
There's something
very, very wrong.

38:50.806 --> 38:51.981
It's the comet.

38:52.025 --> 38:54.375
It's fine. No, it's fine.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.682
Percival is toast,

38:56.725 --> 38:59.467
and the comet is going to pass
over Riverdale, no biggie.

38:59.511 --> 39:01.164
But that's just it, Cheryl.

39:02.383 --> 39:03.471
You'd better see for yourself.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.312
[Tabitha] How are you feeling?

39:19.182 --> 39:20.314
A little foggy.

39:21.663 --> 39:23.230
Truthfully, just relieved.

39:24.449 --> 39:25.754
[sighs]

39:25.798 --> 39:27.321
Uh, I am confused, though.

39:28.191 --> 39:29.671
You saw what happened to me

39:29.715 --> 39:33.153
in every one of your
time-traveling
scenarios, right?

39:33.196 --> 39:35.547
I died. It was a fixed point.

39:38.680 --> 39:39.812
Why am I still here?

39:41.117 --> 39:42.945
I'm not sure.

39:42.989 --> 39:45.600
I know that's not
a great answer, Jug,

39:45.644 --> 39:51.476
but I was only
exploring scenarios
in Riverdale, not Rivervale.

39:52.651 --> 39:56.394
Maybe something shifted
between universes.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.135
Yeah, I guess we'll never know.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.531
[Jughead] Similar scenes
were playing out across town.

40:05.707 --> 40:07.448
Everything was
a jumble of emotions.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.190
Shock and gratitude
that we'd survived.

40:11.670 --> 40:14.063
But with so many questions
hanging in the air.

40:15.282 --> 40:17.066
Like, what happens now?

40:19.504 --> 40:21.244
How do we rebuild?

40:21.288 --> 40:22.420
How do we start over?

40:24.813 --> 40:27.033
Would our powers last forever?

40:27.076 --> 40:29.165
Would the dead remain alive?

40:29.209 --> 40:32.560
Was the threat really,
truly over?

40:32.604 --> 40:33.605
[Cheryl] Archie?

40:34.910 --> 40:37.522
Cheryl? What now?

40:37.565 --> 40:39.480
Rally the troops tout-suite.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.526
Turns out, it's not over yet.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.270
Riverdaliens, we have one last
cataclysm to face.

40:47.314 --> 40:51.449
Bailey's Comet is not
simply going to pass over
Riverdale tomorrow night.

40:51.492 --> 40:53.494
We think Percival
did something to it

40:53.538 --> 40:56.454
because now the comet
is headed straight for us.

40:57.977 --> 41:01.763
[muttering in Latin]

41:01.807 --> 41:04.026
[Cheryl] Based on Heather's
latest calculations,

41:04.070 --> 41:06.681
Bailey's Comet is going
to crash into Riverdale
in less than 24 hours.

41:06.725 --> 41:09.162
And it is going to be
an extinction-level event,

41:09.205 --> 41:10.946
killing everyone
and everything.

41:13.079 --> 41:14.515
Oh, my God.

41:14.559 --> 41:17.344
If I can't have Riverdale,
then no one will.

41:17.387 --> 41:19.607
That's the destruction
I saw in the future.

41:22.697 --> 41:25.352
Not fallout from the war
with Percival...

41:26.788 --> 41:29.269
from... the comet.
