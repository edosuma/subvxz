I'm gonna use this barn
as a deprogramming center,

08:22.210 --> 08:24.629
I went to several years
of NYU,

08:24.629 --> 08:25.880
and then she ghosts me?

08:25.880 --> 08:27.590
Also this town is the worst.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.634
I couldn't find a single

08:34.681 --> 08:36.141

08:36.141 --> 08:38.143

mean nothing to her?

08:38.143 --> 08:40.145
- St. Ends...

08:40.145 --> 08:41.604
what does that mean?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.440

of the "best friends" tattoos

to learn something bad

08:46.901 --> 08:48.069

09:18.767 --> 09:20.852

find out for yourself.

I wonder if there's anything
in those blackmail folders.

Why?

I thought your magazine
was no blackmail.

can be used as blackmail,

for some sort of secret pain

09:46.044 --> 09:48.129

09:48.129 --> 09:49.839
I gave her nothing.

to set a boundary

she is obsessed with my body.
