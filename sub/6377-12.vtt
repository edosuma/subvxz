00:07.717 --> 00:10.584
You know that old leatherjacket
I wear sometimes?

00:10.761 --> 00:12.547
The brown one?

00:13.306 --> 00:15.968
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.

00:16.434 --> 00:18.720
I told him it was lucky.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.722
It ain't.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.607
But he don't know that.

00:26.277 --> 00:29.394
Sookie will get the house...

00:29.572 --> 00:31.608
...my bank account.

00:33.618 --> 00:36.030
But I want you to have my truck.

00:37.455 --> 00:40.367
-Really?
-You've been a good friend, Rene.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.533
Hell, thanks, man.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.627
I'm giving it back, though,
soon as they let you go.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.504
They ain't never letting me go, Rene.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.217
There's something inside of me
that's just....

00:55.598 --> 00:57.930
-lt's wrong.
-Oh, come on, now.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.263
Ain't like you went
and killed a bunch of innocent women.

01:03.356 --> 01:05.893
-What?
-They were fangbangers.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.479
If you hadn't done it,
it was just a matter of time--

01:08.653 --> 01:13.773
-You calling my grandma a fangbanger?
-No. Now, don't get your back all up, you.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.408
I'm just saying
you must have had your reasons, that's all.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.569
There ain't no good reason for what I did.

01:20.873 --> 01:24.115
-Man, suppose you're right.
-l'm going in, whether you like it or not.

01:24.293 --> 01:27.251
-He's my brother.
-He's only allowed one visitor at a time.

01:27.421 --> 01:31.755
Either let me by or throw me in there
with him, but I'm gonna see my brother.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.632
Jason.

01:34.178 --> 01:37.670
-l'm sorry, Sookie. I'm so sorry.
-You have nothing to be sorry for.

01:37.848 --> 01:41.136
| just wish I got here before you confessed
to something you didn't do.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.722
I don't even remember doing any of it.

01:45.606 --> 01:49.064
-| just know I did.
-Jason, you need to shut up, okay?

01:49.235 --> 01:53.023
Because I'm real close
to finding out who the real killer is.

03:24.163 --> 03:25.369
His name's Drew Marshall.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.451
He had a sister named Cindy,
and I think he killed her.

03:28.626 --> 03:31.959
Strangled herjust like Maudette
and Dawn and Amy.

03:34.215 --> 03:37.628
If she knows all this, then how come
she hasn't gone to the cops?

03:37.802 --> 03:38.791
I tried that.

03:38.969 --> 03:42.382
So far the cops have done diddlysquat
to protect me and my family.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.012
Besides, I don't have evidence.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.549
I don't even know
what Drew Marshall looks like.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.809
So you can't really be sure he's the killer.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.183
I've seen what's inside his head.

03:51.357 --> 03:53.473
I never believed that about her,
but it's true.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.812
There 's all kinds of strangeness
in this world.

03:55.986 --> 03:59.149
Sookie, I know you wanna help me...

03:59.490 --> 04:02.277
...but that's only because
you can't accept the truth.

04:02.785 --> 04:05.492
I'm a murderer, and I'm going to hell...

04:05.663 --> 04:07.779
-...plain and simple.
-You aren't hearing me.

04:07.957 --> 04:10.824
I think I know who the killer is.
All we gotta do is find him.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.537
Andy.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.581
Listen to me. Don't be stupid.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.666
-Andy!
-What's your problem?

04:16.841 --> 04:19.002
Make her go away.

04:19.552 --> 04:21.463
-Am | your fucking butler?
-Jason.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.344
Please, just get her out of here.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.674
All right, you heard him. Zoo's closed.

04:27.852 --> 04:30.844
Did you get the fax from the Bunkie police
about Drew Marshall...

04:31.021 --> 04:33.273
...the man who's probably the real killer?

04:33.441 --> 04:36.524
Never heard of no fax from no Bunkie P.D.
or Drew whoever...

04:36.694 --> 04:38.184
...but I'll tell you one thing:

04:38.362 --> 04:40.523
The real killer is right there
where he belongs.

04:40.698 --> 04:44.611
You are one hell of a sorry excuse for a cop
and a human being, Andy Bellefleur.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.528
And it's just a matter of time
before everyone knows it.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.249
Hi, I'm Tara.

06:00.486 --> 06:03.728
-Oh, good morning.
-Good morning.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.947
Thought you might be hungry.

06:07.117 --> 06:10.905
Okay, this isn't food. This is a sculpture.

06:11.247 --> 06:13.613
And this place....

06:13.791 --> 06:16.407
You're not really just a social worker,
are you?

06:16.585 --> 06:18.917
I'm a lot of things, just like you.

06:19.088 --> 06:21.579
-Coffee?
-Sure.

06:22.383 --> 06:26.217
I mean, you're notjust
a drunk-driving bartender, are you?

06:26.387 --> 06:31.552
You're also intelligent, resourceful, strong.
A survivor.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.888
I don't feel like any of those things
right now.

06:35.479 --> 06:39.813
I didn't just wreck my car,
| totaled my whole life.

06:39.984 --> 06:41.724
All of it.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.602
Well, I suppose that's one way
of looking at it.

06:45.030 --> 06:48.067
Personally,
I see your situation as an opportunity.

06:49.535 --> 06:53.073
| just got a fake exorcism and a DUI.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.831
I probably lost my job, all of my friends...

06:58.085 --> 07:00.167
...and my mother disowned me.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.170
I'm sorry,
but I don't get how that's an opportunity.

07:03.340 --> 07:07.253
Maybe life has just cleared out all the things
that weren't working for you.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.168
Now you've got room to rebuild...

07:09.346 --> 07:12.179
...decide exactly what you want your life
to look like...

07:12.349 --> 07:13.680
...and make that happen.

07:17.021 --> 07:19.182
What do you want, Tara?

07:19.356 --> 07:21.096
What do you want your life to be?

07:23.861 --> 07:25.647
I don't know.

07:26.155 --> 07:29.613
I guess I've never really let myself
want anything.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.447
Oh, that breaks my heart.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.539
Yeah, well, there are people
a lot worse off than me, I'm sure.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.041
I should probably let you get back
to helping them...

07:41.211 --> 07:44.669
...instead of watching me cry
all over your nice breakfast.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.796
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.379
And I promise to pay back the bail
as soon as I can--

07:49.553 --> 07:50.963
Tara, sit down.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.130
You haven't touched your food,
your dress isn't dry...

07:54.308 --> 07:56.970
...and I think we both know
you've got nowhere to go.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.220
Please.

08:04.234 --> 08:09.649
I know it's hard for you to trust me,
but I really dojust wanna help.

08:09.823 --> 08:13.486
Even if that means just giving you a place
to stay until you figure things out.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.949
-Why would you do that?
-Because it's what I do.

08:17.623 --> 08:20.365
It's what I want my life to be,
helping people.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.203
Not because I feel sorry for you...

08:22.378 --> 08:24.664
...and not because I want anything back
from you.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.706
-Then why?
-Because you deserve a chance.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.841
And I'm in a position to give you one.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.402
Fine, you wanna end this? That's fine.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.280
The least you could do is call
and tell me where you are...

08:54.451 --> 08:56.703
...so I can stop worrying about you.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.532
Thanks a lot. I'll talk to you later. Bye.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.117
-Sookie, what are you doing here?
-|'ve got the lunch shift.

09:04.294 --> 09:08.287
Yeah, but with everything going on with
Jason, I figured you'd take the day off.

09:08.465 --> 09:12.128
I'm not staying home and hiding, having
people think I'm ashamed of my brother.

09:12.302 --> 09:16.261
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money
I can get to hire a private investigator.

09:16.432 --> 09:17.922
Drew Marshall is in this town.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.807
Who knows how many times
he's sat in one of these booths...

09:20.978 --> 09:24.311
...looks me right in the eye,
and ordered a burger and fries?

09:24.481 --> 09:25.766
Wouldn't you have heard him?

09:25.941 --> 09:28.853
Wouldn't you have smelled him?
I ain't a shortwave radio.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.564
I spend most of my time
trying not to listen to people.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.105
-Sorry, I didn't mean--
-|t's okay.

09:35.451 --> 09:36.657
I'd better start my prep.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.784
You can only have five minutes with him.
Five minutes.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.791
-Mr. Stackhouse?
-Yeah?

09:45.961 --> 09:50.330
-My name is Orry Dawson.
-Oh, I told them I don't need no lawyer.

09:54.636 --> 09:55.716
I'm not a lawyer.

09:55.888 --> 09:58.675
I'm here on behalf
of the Fellowship of the Sun.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.261
What, that anti-vampire church?

10:02.436 --> 10:04.176
We are a religious organization...

10:04.354 --> 10:08.267
...dedicated to the preservation
and salvation of the human race.

10:08.442 --> 10:12.685
Oh, good,
because I thought you just hated vampires.

10:12.863 --> 10:16.026
And | used to,
but then I got to know one...

10:16.200 --> 10:18.987
...and he was a pretty decent guy.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.776
Until I got him killed.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.368
You see, that's where you're wrong.

10:25.542 --> 10:31.128
What you did,
it was a service to your race and to Jesus.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.290
-And you should be proud of that.
-Yeah.

10:34.468 --> 10:38.177
You know, last year there were over 800
reported vampire-related attacks...

10:38.347 --> 10:43.057
...in Louisiana alone,
and the law won't do nothing about it.

10:43.227 --> 10:46.890
They are too busy respecting those fiends
and their civil rights.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.396
Well, what about our rights?

10:49.566 --> 10:52.228
Our rights to be safe
in our own neighborhoods...

10:52.402 --> 10:54.563
...our right to our own blood.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.820
I don't know nothing about that.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.407
Look...

11:01.078 --> 11:02.864
...officially...

11:03.705 --> 11:05.741
...the Church can't condone
what you did.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.703
You took the lives of four women...

11:08.877 --> 11:11.960
...women who had tainted themselves
and their race...

11:12.130 --> 11:14.917
...but still, human women.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.757
Hey.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.551
But we do recognize...

11:23.725 --> 11:27.343
...that even though your methods
may have been flawed...

11:27.521 --> 11:30.934
...your intentions were pure.

11:34.570 --> 11:38.734
-I got no idea what you're talking about.
-That's smart.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.276
Don't admit to anything.

11:44.955 --> 11:48.698
The Church has started up a fund
for your defense.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.295
In the meantime...

11:55.966 --> 11:58.082
...here's something
to help you pass the time.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.301
You are a brave soldier,
Jason Stackhouse.

12:04.474 --> 12:09.719
-Okay.
-God loves you. You will be saved.

13:32.229 --> 13:36.347
I didn't mean to interrupt.
l was looking for Maryann.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.516
She'll be right back.

13:38.694 --> 13:39.729
You must be Tara.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.231
Come on in.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.404
-l'm Eggs.
-Eggs?

13:48.578 --> 13:51.365
Yeah, well, it's actually Benedict.
Benedict Talley, so....

13:51.540 --> 13:53.576
Eggs Benedict.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.367
-Yeah.
-Oh, shit.

13:56.545 --> 13:59.537
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.
My name's screwed up too.

14:00.132 --> 14:03.169
Tara's a pretty name. Suits you.

14:05.595 --> 14:09.929
Maryann didn't tell me
she had a boyfriend.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.886
Oh, no, no, no.

14:12.060 --> 14:16.019
I'm just staying here
till I get back on my feet, just like you.

14:16.189 --> 14:20.603
So collecting stray black people,
that some kind of hobby of hers?

14:21.611 --> 14:23.602
She was right about you, you are funny.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.896
Oh, yeah?
What else she tell you about me?

14:26.074 --> 14:31.114
Oh, she said you crashed your car
with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.

14:32.456 --> 14:35.619
Yeah. It was vodka.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.044
Really cheap vodka.

14:38.545 --> 14:43.255
Hey, I'm notjudging you, believe me.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.375
When Maryann found me, lwas....

14:48.388 --> 14:51.801
Well, let'sjust say
l was a hell of a lot worse off than you.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.426
She's a miracle worker. You'll see.

14:56.605 --> 14:59.312
Yeah, well,
I won't be sticking around that long.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.150
That's too bad.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.854
Well....

15:08.033 --> 15:09.819
My mama...

15:10.327 --> 15:13.285
...when she thought
something was too good to be true...

15:13.455 --> 15:15.320
...she'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat."

15:16.792 --> 15:19.329
That's exactly what this is.

15:21.379 --> 15:24.997
You know, it took me a long time
to stop looking over my shoulder too.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.424
But there are good people in this world.

15:28.595 --> 15:33.055
Sometimes good shit happens.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.162
Treating him
like he don't remember doing it...

16:43.336 --> 16:44.997
...like he had amnesia or something.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.252
-Hey, Sookie.
-He knows.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.914
-Hey.
-I ain't buying it.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.753
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?

16:50.927 --> 16:53.839
He's just sitting there,
looking like a dog that lost his bone.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.135
And then he says:

16:57.309 --> 17:02.224
"I did it. I killed those women.
You were right all along."

17:02.397 --> 17:04.683
He didn't exactly say that.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.939
Should've seen the look in his eye.

17:07.110 --> 17:10.523
Ice-cold,
like he was talking about roadkill.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.066
Excuse me.

17:13.366 --> 17:17.029
Well, thank God you got him,
Detective Bellefleur.

17:17.204 --> 17:22.039
Can I buy you a beer,
show my appreciation?

17:22.459 --> 17:25.951
That's alright, Rosie,
l was just doing my job.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.707
Whole family full of freaks and killers.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.794
Ought to be ashamed to show her face
after what her brother did.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.836
Sleazy little man-slut Jason Stackhouse,
a goddamn murderer.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.300
I'd pay good money
to watch that boy fry.

17:38.475 --> 17:39.965
He was so cute for a murderer.

17:40.143 --> 17:43.055
Wonder why he never hit on me.
Guess I'm lucky.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.970
She knew about him all along.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.809
Hey, what's going on?

17:46.983 --> 17:49.690
You're right,
I shouldn't have come in today.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.568
-Go to my trailer and lie down.
-I need to get out of here.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.900
Sookie, it's not safe.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.817
I'm just gonna drive around.
I'll keep my doors locked.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.076
-I won't even get out of the car.
-No,SooMe.

18:00.247 --> 18:03.865
I need some time alone. l'm....
I gotta get these thoughts out of my head.

18:04.042 --> 18:07.159
All right. All right, all right. Yeah.
I got your tables.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.369
Thank you, Sam.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.254
For everything.

18:12.425 --> 18:16.418
I don’t wanna go to the can right now.
I'm gonna see where this goes.

18:33.655 --> 18:37.239
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.

18:42.664 --> 18:47.078
Shoot! Darn it! Son of a mother-- Fudge!

18:50.297 --> 18:52.003
SooMe.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.672
Everything all right?

18:55.135 --> 18:59.048
Just a little car trouble, that's all.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.337
Want me to take a look?

19:07.897 --> 19:10.889
Well, don't tell nobody,
but I don't know much about cars.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.230
-Sorry.
-Thanks for trying.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.233
I guess I should call a tow.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.822
Well, why don't you let me
give you a ride home.

19:19.993 --> 19:23.485
I'll get my buddy Hank down at Auto Haven
to take a look on my way back.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.532
I can't be alone.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.746
Course you can't.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.757
How about I give you a ride,
stay with you till Sam gets off?

19:37.927 --> 19:40.088
-I couldn't put you out like that.
-No,no,no.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.805
Your brother's been real good to me.

19:43.975 --> 19:47.718
-Least I could do.
-That's so kind of you, Rene.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.930
Hey, Sookie, Rene.

19:52.442 --> 19:56.776
| just wanna say, I told Andy,
I've known killers, and Jason ain't one.

19:57.947 --> 20:01.439
-Thank you, Terry.
-Nobody ever listens to me.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.073
But they should.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.286
Ready?

20:34.442 --> 20:37.809
I can't believe Jason gave you his truck.
He loves this truck.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.602
I know, right?

20:39.781 --> 20:42.773
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.903
Buckle up, now.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.492
Thanks.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.503
Is it really true?
You can hear what I'm thinking right now?

21:00.677 --> 21:03.510
What do I think about?
Think about nothing, nothing, nothing.

21:03.930 --> 21:04.965
Think about nothing.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.847
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.099
Trust me, everyone's tried it around me.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.511
Sooner or later,
you'll think about something.

21:13.481 --> 21:18.350
You know, what's kind of funny
is that your thoughts don't have an accent.

21:21.865 --> 21:24.698
That must be hard on you,
living with that.

21:25.535 --> 21:28.993
It is hard, sometimes.

21:30.165 --> 21:33.282
You have no idea how sick
and twisted some people are.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.371
Oh, Lord, I can believe that. Yes, ma'am.

21:35.545 --> 21:38.753
It's one thing
when they think horrible stuff about me.

21:38.923 --> 21:42.791
I mean, I'm kind of used to it.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.551
But, well, when it's about my brother....

21:50.852 --> 21:53.059
He's all I've got left.

21:53.938 --> 21:57.522
I mean, I've lost everyone.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.192
Thanks.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.956
You know, I've lost people too.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.877
It don't ever get any easier...

22:20.256 --> 22:22.463
...but you find ways to cope.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.943
Coby, Lisa.

22:45.323 --> 22:48.690
I thought I told you kids
to take out the garbage.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.952
What the hell are you watching?

22:54.916 --> 22:58.124
Oh, my Lord. Where'd you get this?

22:58.962 --> 23:00.452
Coby.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.288
Lisa, you answer me right now.

23:03.466 --> 23:07.209
lt's Rene's. We found it in the garage.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.132
Go to your room.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.739
lt's hotter in here than hell on a Sunday.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.620
Yeah, Gran used to
leave the windows open all day...

23:36.791 --> 23:40.375
...but I haven't felt safe doing that
in a while.

23:40.795 --> 23:45.038
-Have a seat. l'll fix us some iced teas.
-Sounds good.

24:15.204 --> 24:19.322
These fuckers' palates
are as backwoods as their brains.

24:21.210 --> 24:26.079
-Sam, Rene left his vest.
-Put it in lost and found.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.929
Hey, where's Sookie? Did you see her?

24:43.107 --> 24:44.563
-Yep.
-Where'd she go?

24:44.734 --> 24:49.023
She left with Rene
about 20, 23 minutes ago.

24:51.866 --> 24:54.983
-Rene, you take it sweet?
-Yes, ma'am.

24:56.412 --> 24:57.401
You scared me.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.366
Did I?

25:01.584 --> 25:03.085
Sorry about that.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.914
Don’t think about it.
Blood, blood, blood. So much.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.750
She wasn't supposed to be here. Shut up!

25:07.924 --> 25:10.586
-Rene?
-How come Sookie ain't here?

25:13.096 --> 25:14.882
You weren't supposed to be here.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.761
SooMe.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.721
You all right?

25:23.606 --> 25:27.849
I'm so jumpy these days.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.067
-Let me help you with that.
-No.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.437
I'm gonna go get a mop.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.286
What do you think you're doing?

25:48.464 --> 25:49.544
Stay away.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.175
You're not gonna shoot me.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.763
Told you.

25:59.934 --> 26:03.927
She deserves it, needs it, wants to die.
That's why she fucks them fangers.

26:08.317 --> 26:11.150
Fuck. Goddamn it!

26:16.451 --> 26:18.942
Get back here, you fucking bitch!

26:25.251 --> 26:28.163
-Dang it.
-Ain't nothing that'll cover what you done.

26:29.547 --> 26:33.256
You watching me now? You freak.

26:34.761 --> 26:35.921
SooMe!

26:38.181 --> 26:40.172
But you're the freak, Cindy.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.635
You're the damn freak.
Fucking freak. Fuck!

26:42.810 --> 26:45.677
Spread your legs for a dead man?
Mama would roll in her grave.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.470
Get the fuck out of here.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.399
SooMe!

26:52.945 --> 26:54.981
Sookie, I'm gonna get you, you bitch!

26:55.698 --> 27:00.158
No, no. What are you doing?
Get away from me! No!

27:05.124 --> 27:06.864
Get out! Fuck!

27:10.880 --> 27:12.711
I can feel you in my head.

27:13.633 --> 27:14.873
I thought you were Jason.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.877
Die, fang-fucker!

27:31.526 --> 27:34.233
Stay the fuck out of my head! Fuck!

27:53.047 --> 27:54.787
SooMe!

27:55.216 --> 27:57.047
SooMe!

28:35.923 --> 28:37.959
SooMe.

28:39.302 --> 28:42.419
Come on, Sookie, let's be--
Let's be friends.

28:42.597 --> 28:44.133
I'm sorry.

28:44.307 --> 28:46.548
I didn't mean to scare you.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.759
Sookie, l was just playing.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.269
Sookie? Seriously, I was just kidding.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.813
You fucking hear me,
you ﬁlthy fucking cunt?

29:01.991 --> 29:06.826
I'm gonna tear out your goddamn throat
with my hands and fuck your dead face.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.869
Shit. Goddamn it, I must have lost her.

29:13.044 --> 29:16.081
Could be hiding in the woods.
I'd better go back and check. Shit.

29:30.186 --> 29:34.520
Mind-reading,
vampire-fucking freak bitch!

29:44.825 --> 29:47.988
You think you're so smart?
You smart now?

30:01.842 --> 30:04.504
Fucking with me.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.463
Fuck.

30:09.892 --> 30:12.224
What the fuck are you?

30:12.770 --> 30:14.385
What the fuck?

30:18.150 --> 30:19.890
SooMe.

30:24.907 --> 30:29.025
Fuck you, you fucking freak fuck!

30:29.203 --> 30:34.072
Fucking sick fuck.
Die, you fucking freak of nature!

30:36.711 --> 30:38.417
Die!

30:42.925 --> 30:44.005
Fucking bitch.

31:01.277 --> 31:02.938
SooMe.

31:37.480 --> 31:41.974
I am sorry.

31:42.151 --> 31:43.641
No.

31:44.612 --> 31:47.729
-No, Bill, please.
-We gotta get him out of the light.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.348
SooMe?

32:26.153 --> 32:28.269
Tara.

32:29.490 --> 32:33.028
You look so pretty.

32:33.911 --> 32:37.495
Like someone turned a light on
under your skin.

32:38.958 --> 32:42.325
Hospital gave her pain meds.
She's a little loopy.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.746
Didn't you listen
when I said I'd lose my shit...

32:46.924 --> 32:48.710
...if anything ever happened to you?

32:49.385 --> 32:51.876
Don't lose your shit.

32:52.805 --> 32:55.046
I'm fine.

32:56.767 --> 32:59.600
Did Sam tell you...

33:00.229 --> 33:02.060
...that he saved my life?

33:07.903 --> 33:12.237
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.

33:13.951 --> 33:17.364
Oh, shit. I'm gonna need
some of them drugs they gave you.

33:19.915 --> 33:22.327
Hey, you guys, we should let her rest.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.037
Sam...

33:24.461 --> 33:29.171
...you need to let people see
the real you...

33:29.341 --> 33:34.210
...because you're kind and brave.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.674
There's nothing there not to love.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.552
Right back at you.

34:08.464 --> 34:11.547
All right, then. Thanks.

34:13.469 --> 34:17.883
-DA's dropping the charges.
-No. No fucking way. He confessed.

34:18.057 --> 34:22.676
The marks on Amy Burley's neck
match Rene's belt.

34:22.853 --> 34:23.888
Or Drew Marshall.

34:24.063 --> 34:27.476
Whatever the hell his name is,
he near about put Sookie in a body bag.

34:27.650 --> 34:29.561
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.066
That's horseshit!

34:32.238 --> 34:35.776
Get ahold of yourself, Andy.
I don't need you screwing things up worse.

34:35.950 --> 34:39.989
-So, what, we're just gonna let him go?
-Not "we."

34:40.162 --> 34:42.869
You brought him in. You let him go.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.996
Right now, Andy.

34:57.721 --> 35:00.053
Oh, hey, Andy.

35:00.224 --> 35:04.593
Is there some way I can get a magazine?
This shit's putting me to sleep.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.186
-What are you doing?
-Get out of here.

35:08.357 --> 35:11.724
-What?
-You heard me, get the fuck out of here.

35:14.738 --> 35:18.196
-ls this some kind of trick or something?
-No, you stupid shit.

35:18.367 --> 35:22.201
It ain't a trick. It's a fucking miracle.

35:24.373 --> 35:29.367
Oh, sweet Jesus, please forgive me.
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.

35:29.795 --> 35:33.788
-Course you didn't.
-I brought him around my kids.

35:33.966 --> 35:38.551
I slept in the bed with him every night,
and all that time it was nothing but lies.

35:39.763 --> 35:43.255
I mean, his name, his accent....

35:43.434 --> 35:46.141
God, you think you know someone.

35:47.146 --> 35:50.730
-How could I not know?
-None of us did.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.639
Don't blame yourself, honey.

35:52.818 --> 35:57.232
I can't help it.
I told you to stay out of my thoughts.

35:57.573 --> 35:59.655
Isn't that why you didn't listen in
on Rene?

36:01.910 --> 36:07.405
It's like he kept that part of himself
locked away...

36:07.583 --> 36:12.498
...in some dark corner of his mind.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.411
Oh, God.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.751
SooMe.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.417
I'm so sorry.

36:23.724 --> 36:26.682
I want you to promise me something,
okay?

36:26.852 --> 36:27.887
Okay.

36:28.062 --> 36:31.179
Someday, if I ever find another man...

36:31.357 --> 36:35.726
...I want you to look inside his head
and tell me everything that's in there.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.069
Arlene, it doesn't really work that way.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.275
Just promise me, okay?

36:42.242 --> 36:45.700
Because I have the worst taste in men.

36:51.502 --> 36:53.743
ls Bill gonna be okay?

36:59.301 --> 37:01.087
I don't think so.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.050
No.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.890
Oh, honey.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.394
Oh, sweet baby.

37:16.610 --> 37:19.477
Well, I'm gonna head on over to the bar.

37:20.030 --> 37:24.490
Make sure Terry ain't PTSD'ing
all over my clam chowder.

37:24.660 --> 37:28.244
Hey, thanks, Lafayette.
Appreciate you holding down the fort.

37:28.414 --> 37:29.620
Oh, no worries, boyfriend.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.621
I'm gonna hit your ass up
for a raise...

37:31.792 --> 37:35.000
...as soon as they pull them stitches
out your forehead.

37:35.504 --> 37:37.369
Call me later, T.

37:44.138 --> 37:46.003
Where have you been?

37:47.266 --> 37:49.678
I left you like five messages.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.517
I didn't get any messages.

37:52.688 --> 37:54.098
What?

37:54.773 --> 37:58.857
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
Sookie almost died.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.814
And she would have
if you hadn't have been there...

38:02.448 --> 38:04.313
...so I'm glad you were, okay?

38:05.325 --> 38:06.576
Yeah.

38:06.743 --> 38:09.530
l was worried about you.

38:10.289 --> 38:14.498
I'm sure you were.
You worry about everybody.

38:15.377 --> 38:19.040
Because Sookie's right,
you're an amazing guy.

38:21.717 --> 38:24.379
You deserve to get everything you want.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.923
And so do |.

38:29.224 --> 38:30.839
What does that mean?

38:31.018 --> 38:34.556
-Take good care of her.
-Wait, Tara....

38:36.773 --> 38:40.891
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.
Sam, this is Maryann.

38:41.487 --> 38:44.524
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.654
You ready to go?

38:50.746 --> 38:55.786
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Did you think I wasn't gonna find you?

38:55.959 --> 38:58.746
You silly, silly dog.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.712
I should've known.

39:06.178 --> 39:09.887
Because there were things
he liked to do in bed...

39:10.307 --> 39:12.514
...that no normal man ever does.

39:15.562 --> 39:16.893
Jason.

39:20.150 --> 39:22.266
I've never been happier to see you
in my life.

39:22.444 --> 39:25.231
That's nice, but, sweetie,
I'm black and blue all over...

39:25.405 --> 39:26.941
...and you're squeezing me.

39:27.115 --> 39:29.242
Oh, sorry.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.033
Shit.

39:32.204 --> 39:34.866
Look what that son of a bitch did to you.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.035
I can't believe I gave him my truck.

39:38.502 --> 39:43.212
If he was still alive right now,
I'd fucking kill him again.

39:43.632 --> 39:44.792
Excuse me.

39:50.639 --> 39:53.802
-Me and my mouth.
-She'll be all right.

39:53.976 --> 39:55.807
Eventually.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.435
You know, I was sitting in that jail...

40:02.609 --> 40:05.601
...and | just kept thinking
about all the stupid stuff I'd done.

40:05.779 --> 40:07.110
That must have kept you busy.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.651
And I know it seems
like all I ever think about is myself...

40:10.826 --> 40:13.238
...and drinking and chasing women.

40:13.412 --> 40:16.119
But that's only because
I thought that's all l was good at.

40:16.290 --> 40:18.326
That's not true.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.742
You were good at football.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.877
Not good enough for a scholarship.

40:25.591 --> 40:29.425
I ain't never been good enough for anything
oranybody.

40:30.012 --> 40:31.502
Well, except maybe Amy.

40:34.224 --> 40:36.556
But she's gone, so....

40:37.352 --> 40:40.185
So I was in there, waiting to die too...

40:40.355 --> 40:44.348
...and I realized
my life wasn't worth nothing.

40:44.860 --> 40:47.101
I've never done nothing
worth being proud of.

40:48.030 --> 40:50.737
-All I could think to do was to end it.
-Jason--

40:50.907 --> 40:55.867
No, it's okay,
because then something happened.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.872
Sook...

40:58.874 --> 41:00.830
...l was saved.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.866
l was given a second chance.

41:03.045 --> 41:05.787
And now I know
that all this bad stuff that happened...

41:05.964 --> 41:07.875
...it happened for a reason.

41:08.050 --> 41:10.166
What's that?

41:10.844 --> 41:14.712
I ain't sure yet, but I do know I'm meant
to do something important with my life.

41:14.890 --> 41:19.224
And as soon as | find out what that is,
I ain't gonna fuck it up.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.727
-That's good, I guess.
-Yeah.

41:30.238 --> 41:31.523
I love you, Sook.

41:32.991 --> 41:36.575
And I'm gonna take good care of you
from now on, I promise.

41:36.745 --> 41:40.158
How about you just take care
of yourself...

41:40.582 --> 41:41.947
...and stay out of trouble.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.207
No, you don't have to worry
about me no more.

41:46.755 --> 41:48.336
I'm good.

41:53.970 --> 41:58.134
Why is all the fucking garbage
on the side of the garbage can?

41:58.308 --> 42:03.769
Nasty motherfuckers.
Got no goddamned home-training.

42:05.774 --> 42:07.605
You motherfucking...

42:08.318 --> 42:09.728
Shit.

42:09.903 --> 42:11.518
Oh, my God.

42:12.114 --> 42:14.981
Daddy. Oh, Daddy, [missed you.

42:15.158 --> 42:17.274
I found you, I found you.

42:17.452 --> 42:20.569
They said you were dead,
but I knew you weren't.

42:21.373 --> 42:22.954
on, Daddy.

42:23.125 --> 42:26.583
Hold me close.
You won't ever go away again, will you?

42:38.098 --> 42:42.387
-You're alive.
-Well, technically, no.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.968
But I am healed.

42:49.609 --> 42:50.985
l fed.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.562
Would you like to come in?

42:56.158 --> 42:57.739
Yes.

43:22.559 --> 43:24.174
No.

43:24.978 --> 43:27.310
Without my blood,
it'll take weeks for you to heal.

43:27.773 --> 43:29.855
I don't care.

43:30.025 --> 43:35.361
After everything,
I just need to feel human right now.

43:37.783 --> 43:39.319
I failed you.

43:39.868 --> 43:43.861
You were willing to sacrifice yourself
to save me.

43:44.039 --> 43:45.529
But if I had just been--

43:46.041 --> 43:48.999
My life is too short for all that.

44:19.658 --> 44:22.741
Yesterday the Vermont supreme court
ruled that limiting marriage...

44:22.911 --> 44:26.324
...between only human men and women
is unconstitutional...

44:26.498 --> 44:29.365
...effectively legalizing vampire marriage
in the state.

44:29.543 --> 44:31.204
Courthouses still be staying open...

44:31.378 --> 44:34.040
...to accommodate hundreds of couples
all over America.

44:34.214 --> 44:36.330
Oh, my God, Sookie,
you know what this means?

44:36.508 --> 44:38.544
Now you and Bill can get married.

44:38.718 --> 44:43.428
Stop it, Arlene. This isn't Vermont.

44:43.598 --> 44:46.590
Besides, he hasn't even asked me yet...

44:46.768 --> 44:49.350
...and I don't know what I'd say if he did.

44:49.521 --> 44:51.853
I think you should marry Bill.

44:52.023 --> 44:54.981
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.
It won't even break the bank.

44:55.151 --> 44:59.110
All you need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood,
seeing as how they don't eat or drink.

44:59.281 --> 45:03.274
Bet there's even a vampire band
and vampire wedding decorations.

45:03.451 --> 45:04.782
Put Arlene's party to shame.

45:09.708 --> 45:12.620
You know,
you're about as subtle as a flying brick.

45:13.962 --> 45:15.702
Maryann says if you want something...

45:15.881 --> 45:18.247
...you don't wait for it to come,
you demand it.

45:18.425 --> 45:20.632
Do me a favor,
don't quote Maryann to me.

45:21.344 --> 45:24.177
Well, excuse me for giving a damn.

45:25.640 --> 45:28.507
You heard from your cousin,
by any chance?

45:28.685 --> 45:31.142
Because I'm about to give away his job.

45:31.313 --> 45:34.020
But one time Lafayette went to Marthaville
for the night.

45:34.190 --> 45:37.318
He ended up go-go dancing in Palm Beach
for like eight months.

45:37.485 --> 45:38.736
Fantastic.

45:41.615 --> 45:43.105
Okay.

45:48.705 --> 45:52.994
People disappear all the time,
but they're never really gone.

45:53.376 --> 45:56.493
The good parts of them always stay put.

45:59.341 --> 46:02.833
I hope you're right about that, Terry.

46:04.012 --> 46:06.674
Your hair's like a sunset
after a bomb went off.

46:08.475 --> 46:10.011
Pretty.

46:15.815 --> 46:22.061
And God said, "Let there be light,"
and there was light.

46:22.238 --> 46:27.358
And even though we stand
in darkness today, we shall not fear...

46:27.535 --> 46:31.869
...for God has given us
the ultimate weapon...

46:32.040 --> 46:35.828
...the ultimate salvation:

46:36.252 --> 46:38.243
The sun.

46:38.630 --> 46:45.377
And he has placed in front of us
a daunting but righteous task.

46:47.055 --> 46:48.386
We will not falter.

46:50.058 --> 46:52.265
We will not rest...

46:52.435 --> 46:56.019
...until we have brought
God's holy light down...

46:56.189 --> 47:00.353
...on each and every
bloodsucking abomination.

47:02.612 --> 47:05.274
-Hallelujah, brother!
-Hallelujah!

47:05.448 --> 47:07.404
-Amen.
-Praise Jesus!

47:11.204 --> 47:13.069
Amen.

47:16.835 --> 47:18.416
Time to pack it up, Andy.

47:18.586 --> 47:21.828
My family used to own
this whole damn town...

47:22.007 --> 47:24.248
”theland
this rat hole stands on included.

47:24.426 --> 47:26.257
You don't own this rat hole no more...

47:26.428 --> 47:28.589
-...so I'm cutting you off.
-Join the club.

47:28.763 --> 47:31.550
One minute you're a hero,
next you can't get a fucking drink.

47:31.725 --> 47:36.094
Well, I ain't never seen a bird fly so high
it don't have to come down sometime.

47:48.783 --> 47:51.115
-What's that for?
-|t's your pity party.

47:51.286 --> 47:54.278
Only one you're getting from me,
so suck it up.

47:55.874 --> 47:57.910
-Thanks.
-Don't thank me.

47:58.084 --> 48:01.292
It's just easier for me not to hate you.
Hating takes a lot of energy.

48:01.463 --> 48:04.330
I'm saving mine up
for all the good shit that's coming my way.

48:04.507 --> 48:07.465
Because I am a good person,
and I deserve good shit in my life.

48:07.635 --> 48:10.297
Yeah, yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.

48:18.021 --> 48:20.728
Thank you, Sookie.
Hey, where's Vampire Bill at tonight?

48:20.899 --> 48:23.936
Is he out celebrating
at some sort of vampire party?

48:24.861 --> 48:28.479
Actually,
we're celebrating together later.

48:29.449 --> 48:32.532
Well, just tell him congratulations
from me.

48:32.702 --> 48:34.784
I mean, I don't care what nobody says...

48:34.954 --> 48:38.822
...ifl met a nice vampire girl,
I'd be proud to have her on my arm.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.912
I'd love to see your mama's face
if you brought her for dinner.

48:42.087 --> 48:43.372
Yeah, me too.

48:43.546 --> 48:47.164
You know, yeah, I mean-- Well,
does Bill know anybody my age?

48:48.843 --> 48:50.174
Seriously.

49:01.147 --> 49:02.808
Hi, Daddy.

49:06.569 --> 49:07.945
What is this?

49:08.113 --> 49:11.526
There are favors and there are favors.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.486
She is extremely annoying.

49:16.037 --> 49:19.245
-You can't do this. We had a deal.
-Well, now the terms have changed.

49:19.415 --> 49:22.657
She's yours.
Unless you wanna give me Sookie.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.384
It's just a suggestion.

49:31.219 --> 49:34.211
Though a few nights with this one
may change your mind.

49:36.933 --> 49:38.844
Good luck.

49:47.485 --> 49:51.148
So who's good to eat around here?

50:00.707 --> 50:04.120
He ain't listening to me. Good luck.

50:06.754 --> 50:09.086
We're closing. Give me your keys.

50:09.257 --> 50:11.919
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.

50:12.093 --> 50:16.757
I'm a failure, a pathetic fucking loser,
and everybody knows it, just like she said.

50:16.931 --> 50:18.546
Bet she's real happy with herself.

50:18.725 --> 50:22.183
It don't ever make me happy
to see someone in pain.

50:23.438 --> 50:26.601
I'm gonna call your sister
to come pick you up...

50:27.442 --> 50:28.773
...Detective Bellefleur.

51:04.646 --> 51:05.681
Where's my car?

51:05.855 --> 51:08.642
Andy, the only thing you're driving tonight
is us crazy.

51:08.816 --> 51:11.728
Portia said she's on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.

51:11.903 --> 51:14.269
I don't have them. Left them in the car.

51:14.447 --> 51:16.984
Right here, underneath this light.

51:17.158 --> 51:21.242
-Some son of a bitch stole my car.
-You sure this is where you parked it?

51:21.412 --> 51:24.324
This whole town's gone to shit.

51:24.499 --> 51:28.412
Nobody used to go murdering each other,
stealing cars.

51:28.586 --> 51:31.919
That's what happens
when you don't let a good cop do his job.

51:32.423 --> 51:33.629
Ain't that it over there?

51:37.178 --> 51:38.509
That ain't where I parked.

51:41.349 --> 51:42.680
What the hell?

51:51.901 --> 51:54.688
That ain't mine, I swear.
