WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:07.000
<i>I had to fight
and kick and scratch
for everything that I have.</i>

00:07.000 --> 00:10.689
<i>And that's how I've supported
my family for years.</i>

00:12.862 --> 00:16.000
<i>I've lost quite a bit
in life just because
of my background</i>

00:16.000 --> 00:17.931
<i>and my family situation.</i>

00:17.931 --> 00:21.172
<i>That's why I'm gonna
make this mining thing
pay off for me in spades.</i>

00:21.172 --> 00:23.827
<i>I haven't wasted years
of my life for nothing.</i>

00:25.827 --> 00:28.241
<i>The Kellys,
they're not real gold miners.</i>

00:28.241 --> 00:32.241
<i>They're</i>[bleep] <i>crooks
and scam artists.</i>

00:32.241 --> 00:35.517
<i>Shawn's just pissed off
it didn't take me
three generations</i>

00:35.517 --> 00:38.620
of my family to get
to Shawn's spot.

00:38.620 --> 00:41.206
He's making
poor life choices right now,

00:41.206 --> 00:43.379
and he's
with the wrong [bleep] guy.

00:44.517 --> 00:46.827
I don't want any problems.
I just want to go mining.

00:46.827 --> 00:49.275
These
think
they own the ocean.

00:50.931 --> 00:52.448
Come on, Shawn.

00:53.965 --> 00:57.068
I'm gonna go over there
and I'm gonna rip him off
that [bleep] barge,

00:57.068 --> 00:59.965
and I'm gonna put my
fist right down right
six inches

00:59.965 --> 01:02.620
into his [bleep] skull.

01:02.620 --> 01:04.206
<i>You know, you got
to be ready to fight</i>

01:04.206 --> 01:08.172
and defend at a drop of a half
for what you have
and what you want to keep.

01:08.172 --> 01:09.620
- Come on.
- I'll [bleep] you up.

01:09.620 --> 01:11.103
Get the [bleep] away from me.

01:11.103 --> 01:12.275
Go.

01:38.137 --> 01:41.000
God, this stuff
looks amazing.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.689
Oh, it just keeps coming up
bucket after bucket,
beautiful looking material.

01:48.689 --> 01:53.793
<i>Shawn Pomrenke
has got his operation
right where he wants it.</i>

01:53.793 --> 01:56.758
This stuff looks really good.

01:56.758 --> 02:00.068
<i>Milking a hot
pay streak on the Tomcod.</i>

02:03.137 --> 02:04.241
Hey, Cody...

02:13.413 --> 02:16.275
The season's had some
rough patches for sure.

02:16.275 --> 02:21.000
The equipment,
the weather, most of all,
dealing with Kris Kelly.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.655
<i>But everything's
clicking now.</i>

02:23.655 --> 02:26.413
<i>I got the Christine Rose
and the Myrtle on
a pay streak</i>

02:26.413 --> 02:28.896
<i>that we got on the last
time out.</i>

02:28.896 --> 02:32.068
<i>I'm aiming
for 3,000 ounces this year.</i>

02:32.068 --> 02:35.413
If it keeps going like this,
we'll pull it off for sure.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.827
I think if we just keep
plugging away here

02:39.827 --> 02:41.034
and doing what we're doing,

02:41.034 --> 02:42.931
we're gonna hit that one
hot spot

02:42.931 --> 02:47.517
where we load
a thousand ounces
in the box in a day.

02:47.517 --> 02:50.655
I mean, that's what keeps us
going here anyway.

02:52.068 --> 02:53.551
We're making gold!

02:59.275 --> 03:01.551
<i>Back at the harbor...</i>

03:01.551 --> 03:04.586
There's a million ways
to figure out how to do this.

03:04.586 --> 03:08.310
But only one way
to succeed,
and that's to get gold.

03:08.310 --> 03:11.379
<i>Kris Kelly's
unleashing a secret weapon.</i>

03:16.517 --> 03:18.551
Sounds like money, baby.

03:20.689 --> 03:22.793
Go get some gold.

03:22.793 --> 03:25.344
Bam, we're ready
to go to work.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.655
So far, this summer's
been a disaster.

03:28.655 --> 03:30.965
<i>The Mistress has been
a nightmare.</i>

03:30.965 --> 03:33.482
I owe 125,000
at the end of the month.

03:33.482 --> 03:36.896
And Shawn Pomrenke
has been up my ass
the whole season.

03:36.896 --> 03:40.137
<i>But now I got
a brand-new excavator
on there, and it's way bigger.</i>

03:40.137 --> 03:42.068
We're gonna kill
it the rest of the way.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.655
Hey, get on the boat.

03:47.655 --> 03:48.931
<i>We're going
to get out there.</i>

03:48.931 --> 03:50.793
<i>We're gonna make
a lot of gold
and going right back</i>

03:50.793 --> 03:53.310
<i>to the same spot
we left off on last time.</i>

03:53.310 --> 03:55.000
<i>We really need that
right now.</i>

03:55.000 --> 03:58.413
And I hope that
the Christine Rose
didn't take my spot

03:58.413 --> 04:00.034
then we were gone.

04:00.034 --> 04:02.137
<i>James is gonna
get the Mistress positioned,</i>

04:02.137 --> 04:04.344
<i>and I'm going to get
the rest of the parts
for the Reaper</i>

04:04.344 --> 04:06.068
<i>for our two-pronged assault.</i>

04:06.068 --> 04:09.620
Finally, the full potential
of Reaper Nation
will be realized.

04:14.758 --> 04:16.482
Security, security, security.

04:16.482 --> 04:20.000
This is the Mistress
exiting the south wall
and exiting the harbor.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.482
Any concerning traffic
on 16 and 19?

04:24.103 --> 04:26.758
What I'm going to do
is I'm going to get
this back on spot.

04:26.758 --> 04:29.310
Hopefully, our ground
that we were on wasn't
touched

04:29.310 --> 04:31.655
by the Christine Rose
or the Myrtle.

04:31.655 --> 04:34.482
Hopefully, they just
kind of went about
their own business

04:34.482 --> 04:36.517
and didn't [bleep] up
our gold patch.

04:43.103 --> 04:46.655
Well, they are [bleep] close.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.965
If they're not on our spot,
I'd be amazed.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.275
Both the Myrtle Irene
and the Christine Rose.

04:55.275 --> 04:56.586
Doesn't surprise me.

04:56.586 --> 04:57.793
I drop a good buoy.

04:57.793 --> 04:58.965
I got good gold.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.241
They want it.

05:01.655 --> 05:04.310
All right, So I'm looking
at my GPS coordinates.

05:05.241 --> 05:07.517
It looks like
they're right on our spot.

05:07.517 --> 05:09.931
slimy bastards.

05:09.931 --> 05:11.379
In this game,
you're supposed
to at least

05:11.379 --> 05:12.448
have a little bit of ethics.

05:12.448 --> 05:14.206
But they [bleep] lack 'em.

05:14.206 --> 05:15.965
They just think it's funny.

05:15.965 --> 05:18.862
They're like, "Ha, ha, ha.
You had a [bleep] breakdown.

05:18.862 --> 05:20.965
We're going to go jump
your buoy and get your gold."

05:20.965 --> 05:24.137
chicken
thing to do.

05:24.137 --> 05:25.724
Kick somebody
when they're down.

05:25.724 --> 05:27.689
You don't jump
somebody else's buoy.

05:28.655 --> 05:30.000
But...

05:33.965 --> 05:38.448
All right, so the Rose
and the Myrtle like
to jump buoys.

05:38.448 --> 05:40.620
So I'm just going
to split the gap.

05:40.620 --> 05:43.000
Go right in between
nice and easy.

05:51.379 --> 05:53.172
I was here first.

05:53.172 --> 05:54.517
They don't have ethics.

05:54.517 --> 05:56.000
'em both.

06:03.034 --> 06:05.206
Get out of my [bleep] gold.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.620
As far as the risk goes,
it's probably just
gonna piss 'em off

06:11.620 --> 06:14.793
but I guess I don't really
give a [bleep] anymore.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.275
Here they come again.

06:18.275 --> 06:20.827
Kellys are moving
in on me again.

06:27.310 --> 06:28.517
I'm gonna go over there

06:28.517 --> 06:30.413
and I'm gonna rip him off
that [bleep] barge,

06:30.413 --> 06:33.448
and I'm going to put
my fist right down
right [bleep] six inches

06:33.448 --> 06:35.000
into his [bleep] skull.

06:38.103 --> 06:40.689
Oh, dude,
it looks like I just pissed
in their Cheerios.

06:40.689 --> 06:42.172
This is [bleep] great.

06:46.931 --> 06:48.896
They're way down there.

06:48.896 --> 06:51.413
He [bleep] comes
in down there,
we move down here,

06:51.413 --> 06:52.896
he [bleep] moves down here.

06:52.896 --> 06:55.137
He's just
following us around.

06:55.137 --> 06:58.206
And I've had it up
to here with him.

07:07.241 --> 07:10.896
Now while Kelly's come in,
moved in between
me and Cody,

07:10.896 --> 07:13.172
and they're illegal
as [bleep].

07:13.172 --> 07:16.379
And now Cody wants
to move that direction
and he can't because

07:16.379 --> 07:20.379
Kris Kelly is there doing
his stupid [bleep].

07:22.000 --> 07:23.172
What are we going to do here?

07:23.172 --> 07:25.827
You want me to just
move away from him
and keep digging

07:25.827 --> 07:28.793
or just keep digging
and [bleep] him or what?

07:29.724 --> 07:30.862
Well,
what we don't want...

07:30.862 --> 07:32.137
I don't...

07:32.137 --> 07:34.344
I don't know.

07:34.344 --> 07:39.413
I don't want to risk
losing or getting in
trouble over these idiots.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
So I don't know.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
We got to
figure something out.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.827
<i>But Kelly has been
swooping in everywhere
we've been working.</i>

07:47.827 --> 07:50.724
But this last stunt,
it's the worst one yet.

07:51.482 --> 07:52.931
<i>We can't work like this.</i>

07:52.931 --> 07:55.379
<i>This can't continue.</i>

07:55.379 --> 07:58.482
The situation has to be
dealt with once and for all.

08:02.310 --> 08:05.965
So I decided
to just let them know
I was here,

08:05.965 --> 08:08.448
split the dredges,
say [bleep] you, whatever.

08:08.448 --> 08:09.758
Don't give a [bleep].

08:09.758 --> 08:12.655
We're on our boy like
dead nuts.

08:12.655 --> 08:14.241
And I'm gonna
check the ground,

08:14.241 --> 08:15.551
make sure
they didn't disturb it.

08:17.724 --> 08:19.172
Come on.

08:40.344 --> 08:41.931
She's smoking.

08:43.068 --> 08:44.344
Something went wrong.

08:44.344 --> 08:46.620
See what the
just happened.

08:56.551 --> 08:58.448
<i>Back in Nome.</i>

08:58.448 --> 09:01.724
<i>Heading to the dredge,
so I'm excited.</i>

09:01.724 --> 09:06.344
I'm going out
for my second time
dredging on a dredge.

09:09.344 --> 09:11.379
She's going
to be my tender.

09:11.379 --> 09:16.275
<i>Emily Riedel's
latest protege is about
to get thrown to the wolves.</i>

09:16.275 --> 09:18.241
Today, now is
the ultimate test.

09:18.241 --> 09:19.862
I'm going to leave
you alone while...

09:19.862 --> 09:23.862
while Rick's diving,
but you'll be fine.

09:23.862 --> 09:25.724
- Knock on wood.
- Yeah.

09:25.724 --> 09:27.896
<i>I'm trying to get
250 ounces this summer,</i>

09:27.896 --> 09:31.068
and I need a trusted
friend up here to help me
run the operation.

09:31.068 --> 09:32.965
And Jane is it.

09:32.965 --> 09:35.137
<i>We're meeting
our goals so far.</i>

09:35.137 --> 09:36.724
<i>We've got over 80 ounces.</i>

09:36.724 --> 09:40.275
<i>But I also need to make sure
that Jane can handle
the boat on her own.</i>

09:40.275 --> 09:41.827
Today,
we're going to find out.

09:41.827 --> 09:43.896
It's just like unexpected
things that happen.

09:43.896 --> 09:47.068
If Rick is down there
and you see a killer
whale, let Rick know.

09:48.310 --> 09:50.517
If I have rock jam, you know,
I'll show you the protocol.

09:50.517 --> 09:51.689
Oh, yeah.

09:52.965 --> 09:54.344
Oh, you'll see.

09:57.758 --> 09:59.344
Today is my birthday.

09:59.344 --> 10:00.482
Gonna start a shift.

10:00.482 --> 10:01.551
We're back on the water.

10:01.551 --> 10:05.103
It might not be like
the party I always have.

10:05.103 --> 10:07.448
But it could be really cool
if we get lots of gold.

10:08.758 --> 10:10.793
Got some spandex
on too that are gold.

10:13.758 --> 10:15.344
Maybe I'm a good luck charm.

10:27.758 --> 10:28.793
Okay.

10:33.206 --> 10:34.379
Okay.

10:34.379 --> 10:36.344
Doing a communication check.

10:39.310 --> 10:40.413
Uh, yeah.

10:40.413 --> 10:42.206
Here, you want to put this on?
You can hear him.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.310
Okay.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.034
That way,
Rick's always in your head.

10:49.586 --> 10:51.655
He's excited.

10:51.655 --> 10:54.241
All right, now go up there,
and get him in the water.

10:59.758 --> 11:01.137
Yee-haw!

11:03.896 --> 11:05.344
Big bubbles.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.724
Oh.

11:22.827 --> 11:24.000
How's it looking down there?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.172
See any gold?

11:32.310 --> 11:33.586
Seeing sand.

11:36.551 --> 11:38.068
You're at like 1 o'clock.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.310
One o'clock.
Uno o'clock.

11:49.551 --> 11:51.379
One.

11:53.344 --> 11:54.379
Well, 1 o'clock.

11:57.034 --> 11:58.068
Hey, Rick.

11:58.068 --> 11:59.896
Now it looks like
you're at 2 o'clock.

12:02.172 --> 12:03.310
Made it.

12:06.413 --> 12:08.793
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

12:16.137 --> 12:17.689
Emily said idle down.

12:21.448 --> 12:22.517
Right.

12:28.137 --> 12:29.517
This is for the rock jam?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.379
Hey, how are you doing, Rick?

12:38.827 --> 12:40.206
He's getting cold.

12:40.206 --> 12:41.344
All right.
Come on.

12:42.724 --> 12:43.896
Yeah.

12:43.896 --> 12:46.068
You want to do this
as quickly as possible

12:46.068 --> 12:48.103
because the diver
is getting cold.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.103
Okay.

12:53.137 --> 12:55.241
Yeah, I do.
Let me get into it.

13:06.931 --> 13:08.137
Okay.

13:22.206 --> 13:23.689
Tell him yes.

13:23.689 --> 13:26.137
Yeah, it was a big rock,
but we got it out.

13:30.344 --> 13:33.172
So, like,
mentally wasn't like, there.

13:34.448 --> 13:36.379
Mentally prep myself.

13:36.379 --> 13:38.896
Everything happened
so quick in second.

13:38.896 --> 13:41.379
Trying to learn as everything
just happens like chaotically.

13:41.379 --> 13:44.689
I just feel like
I need to write
some stuff down

13:44.689 --> 13:45.862
'cause Emily wants to leave

13:45.862 --> 13:49.586
when I'm actually
not ready to take over yet.

13:59.137 --> 14:01.448
Do all these things
as quickly as possible.

14:01.448 --> 14:02.862
Don't [bleep] up.

14:05.241 --> 14:07.344
Looks like I might be
crying on my birthday.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.000
You know,
this is [bleep].

14:18.000 --> 14:19.655
I want it to work out
right now.

14:19.655 --> 14:23.379
Right [bleep] now,
I want it to work out.

14:23.379 --> 14:28.724
<i>Kris Kelly seemed
slightly perturbed by news
that The Mistress is down.</i>

14:28.724 --> 14:32.689
Everything is
that close from being ready.

14:32.689 --> 14:35.896
So I just got the call
The Mistress
has broken down again.

14:35.896 --> 14:40.413
<i>Can I get one day,
just one day where
everything's working smooth?</i>

14:40.413 --> 14:42.758
<i>That's not too much
to ask for, is it?</i>

14:42.758 --> 14:44.034
Is it?

14:44.034 --> 14:46.103
My deal with James
was that I wasn't even
supposed to be

14:46.103 --> 14:47.689
working on this [bleep] thing.

14:47.689 --> 14:49.137
James was supposed
to take it.

14:49.137 --> 14:51.034
We were supposed
to get a crew taken care
of with him,

14:51.034 --> 14:52.310
run 24 hours a day.

14:52.310 --> 14:54.896
I wasn't even supposed
to be on that boat.

14:54.896 --> 14:56.482
Supposed to just pay me.

14:56.482 --> 14:59.551
And here we are,
where I got to
personally stand

14:59.551 --> 15:02.965
to hold everyone's hand
and everything we need to do.

15:06.241 --> 15:08.000
<i>I'm on my way out
to the Mistress</i>

15:08.000 --> 15:11.034
and I see the Myrtle Irene
and the Christine Rose.

15:11.034 --> 15:13.034
Shawn
and his [bleep].

15:21.344 --> 15:25.896
Shawn is right next
to us again,
pushing it on us.

15:25.896 --> 15:27.000
We got to get going.

15:33.344 --> 15:36.827
One of the nuts off
the electrical connections
came off.

15:36.827 --> 15:39.655
I don't know
if that's the actual issue.

15:39.655 --> 15:42.034
So I'm gonna go
through everything,

15:42.034 --> 15:45.241
snug everything up
and pray it works.

15:47.551 --> 15:49.275
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

15:49.275 --> 15:52.137
Let's get this going,
Shawn's closing in on us.

15:52.137 --> 15:55.068
We need to get an on call
mechanic that's with us.

15:55.068 --> 15:56.758
That is a deckhand
for next year.

15:56.758 --> 15:57.862
Yeah.

15:57.862 --> 15:59.758
This is bull [bleep],
you know?

16:05.172 --> 16:06.517
There it is.

16:06.517 --> 16:08.517
Prime
the water pump, please.

16:12.482 --> 16:16.931
I need something to just
get my
so oily and greasy.

16:21.068 --> 16:22.275
Go do it.

16:22.275 --> 16:23.551
Do that damn thing.

16:25.448 --> 16:28.620
Please, Lord,
bless my excavator today.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.724
Help us out.
Let us take care
of our families.

16:30.724 --> 16:31.965
Amen.

16:35.517 --> 16:36.655
Oh, my God.

16:36.655 --> 16:38.068
The excavator
sounds amazing now.

16:38.068 --> 16:39.862
He fixed it.
He fixed it.

16:46.793 --> 16:50.413
I don't even notice
how hard it is to dig
with this excavator.

16:50.413 --> 16:52.000
She digs well.

16:55.620 --> 16:58.655
Okay,
we're up and running
and everything's going good.

16:58.655 --> 17:00.517
We're going to see
how long this lasts for.

17:00.517 --> 17:05.206
But right now, I think
we are going to be
able to run 24 hours a day,

17:05.206 --> 17:09.344
not having any problems
for at least a month.

17:09.344 --> 17:12.896
If I see one
problem this month,
I'm gonna lose it.

17:17.793 --> 17:19.172
<i>12 miles east...</i>

17:21.000 --> 17:22.310
Finally.

17:23.655 --> 17:24.896
Getting close.

17:26.137 --> 17:27.931
<i>After a slow
start to the season,</i>

17:27.931 --> 17:33.517
<i>Vernon Adkison is hoping
to finally unleash his newly
assembled A-team.</i>

17:33.517 --> 17:35.206
I'm good
to get back out here.

17:35.206 --> 17:38.344
It looks like a very
good day out here.

17:38.344 --> 17:39.724
Nice and calm.

17:39.724 --> 17:42.000
So now it's time
we get some gold.

17:44.862 --> 17:47.517
I'm aiming
for 300 ounces this summer.

17:47.517 --> 17:51.034
But so far, it's just been
300 pains in the ass.

17:51.034 --> 17:54.068
<i>Everything that could
go wrong has gone wrong.</i>

17:54.068 --> 17:56.482
<i>We're on the best claim
on the Bering Sea.</i>

17:56.482 --> 17:57.965
<i>I'm convinced of that.</i>

17:57.965 --> 17:59.689
<i>Now we need to get on track</i>

17:59.689 --> 18:01.448
<i>and kill it the rest
of the way.</i>

18:01.448 --> 18:05.413
And today, that means
getting strong dabs
out of both of my aces.

18:07.965 --> 18:09.034
All right.

18:09.034 --> 18:10.275
You ready?

18:10.275 --> 18:13.034
Let's get him dressed out
and get him in the water.

18:13.034 --> 18:15.034
First up is Gary Simpson.

18:15.034 --> 18:17.310
<i>We can't afford any more
rock jams,</i>

18:17.310 --> 18:20.931
<i>equipment breakdowns,
bad ground.</i>

18:20.931 --> 18:24.137
We just need gold,
gold, gold, and more gold.

18:26.344 --> 18:27.655
Let's get some gold.

18:27.655 --> 18:29.620
Can you get the zipper?

18:29.620 --> 18:30.724
- Yep.
- Hey.

18:30.724 --> 18:31.862
You got to lay off
the chicken.

18:31.862 --> 18:33.000
Tell me about it.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.517
I've been laying
on my ass way too long,

18:34.517 --> 18:35.896
gained 15 pounds
waiting to go down.

18:35.896 --> 18:38.241
It's a good thing
I got a 65 pound
weight belt on.

18:41.586 --> 18:42.620
How you doing?

19:12.034 --> 19:15.310
It's about damn time
we finally got back
in the water.

19:15.310 --> 19:17.689
Maybe take some gold
home with us tonight.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.655
Been a long dry spell.

19:20.655 --> 19:23.689
But that's no...

19:23.689 --> 19:26.620
no, that's part of the game.

19:26.620 --> 19:30.172
But we still got time
to make a decent season
out of it.

19:35.482 --> 19:38.206
The marine growth
on top those rocks,

19:38.206 --> 19:42.137
some places it looks good,
some places it looks bad.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.862
Do you think that area
has been worked?

19:51.206 --> 19:53.275
That's some...
that's some bad gumbo.

19:59.965 --> 20:02.137
Well, I mean, if it's ever
been worked,

20:02.137 --> 20:04.379
it's same difference as
if it was worked yesterday.

20:08.310 --> 20:12.275
Just punch
another hole around
there someplace close.

20:20.241 --> 20:23.310
Those rocks
are looking better now.

20:30.793 --> 20:34.482
Just when you get down
to the clay, let us know
if you see any gold.

20:42.310 --> 20:43.724
Why is it low?

20:44.172 --> 20:45.448
Bryan?

20:45.448 --> 20:46.586
Yeah.

20:46.586 --> 20:48.000
What's going on with this?

20:54.275 --> 20:55.448
Yo, Gary.

21:00.689 --> 21:04.482
Try to get your breathing
stabilized and under control.

21:04.482 --> 21:05.862
Take it easy.

21:08.448 --> 21:11.310
There's something
wrong with the system.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.379
We got an air leak.

21:29.379 --> 21:31.068
Put your hand right here.

21:31.068 --> 21:32.965
Looks like
it's coming out both sides.

21:44.310 --> 21:46.000
Yeah,
it's going back up.

21:48.379 --> 21:52.689
I swear, this summer
is gonna break me
mentally and financially

21:52.689 --> 21:54.793
if we don't start getting
some friggin' gold.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.137
So what are you seeing, Gary?

22:01.275 --> 22:03.344
You're still not seeing
any gold, right?

22:23.275 --> 22:24.931
That's terrific, Gary.

22:28.413 --> 22:30.103
Put it in the box, baby.

22:49.137 --> 22:50.655
Everything is good up here.

22:50.655 --> 22:52.275
Your PSI is like 82.

22:52.275 --> 22:54.517
And the hot water is 100.

22:58.620 --> 23:02.241
<i>The newest
Eroica team members
taking the reigns topside.</i>

23:03.103 --> 23:05.103
<i>How's it looking down there?</i>

23:06.413 --> 23:09.137
<i>I think there's gold
underneth this stuff.</i>

23:11.275 --> 23:15.275
<i>But so far,
the results have only
been plain jane.</i>

23:15.275 --> 23:17.068
Rick's not really
having a good day.

23:17.068 --> 23:19.241
I think we're all not
having a good day.

23:19.241 --> 23:21.000
Maybe the tides will change.

23:23.310 --> 23:25.620
<i>Oh, you got to be kidding me.</i>

23:26.172 --> 23:27.275
<i>What's up?</i>

23:35.413 --> 23:36.413
<i>Roger that.</i>

23:40.517 --> 23:43.034
<i>Jane knew
nothing about this business
coming into it.</i>

23:43.034 --> 23:44.551
<i>But Jane's got balls.</i>

23:44.551 --> 23:46.344
<i>She's the one for the job.</i>

23:46.344 --> 23:47.827
She is hilarious.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.275
She's got a great attitude.

23:49.275 --> 23:52.275
<i>And she's learning really fast
which is exactly what we need.</i>

23:52.275 --> 23:55.206
I'm gonna push her
a bit harder just to see
how far she's come.

23:56.275 --> 23:57.344
Hi.

23:58.344 --> 24:00.758
Hey, Jane-O.

24:00.758 --> 24:03.172
Alex and I are going
to head over take care
of some stuff

24:03.172 --> 24:06.000
and leave you with
el boat-arino.

24:06.517 --> 24:07.655
Okay.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.034
You got everything?

24:09.034 --> 24:11.965
Well, I'm ready to try.

24:11.965 --> 24:13.034
You can do it.

24:13.034 --> 24:15.551
- I'll do my best.
- You got it.

24:18.793 --> 24:21.137
Yeah. No, dude,
I have full confidence.

24:21.137 --> 24:23.172
You got it.

24:23.172 --> 24:26.482
<i>The only way I'll know
if Jane's is ready to handle
topside by herself</i>

24:26.482 --> 24:27.965
<i>is if I leave her alone
out here.</i>

24:27.965 --> 24:29.068
It's risky.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.241
We're gonna have
a diver down.

24:30.241 --> 24:32.379
This is like a real-life
situation here that

24:32.379 --> 24:34.068
she's got to handle
by herself.

24:34.068 --> 24:36.724
<i>And if something happens,
you know, it could be
a life or death situation.</i>

24:36.724 --> 24:38.793
But she's a frontier woman
to the bone,

24:38.793 --> 24:41.413
and she knows how to handle
this type of situation.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.758
All right, have fun.

24:42.758 --> 24:45.206
Make good choices.

24:45.206 --> 24:49.724
Hey, I think it's time
to bring out the golden
spandex for good luck.

24:55.689 --> 24:56.862
Emily's off the boats.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.965
It's just Rick and me
for the first time.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.241
I'm a little nervous.

25:00.241 --> 25:04.413
But I want to be nervous
because I don't want
be overconfident

25:04.413 --> 25:07.068
because this is like
dealing with a man's life
down there.

25:07.068 --> 25:08.241
You know?

25:15.517 --> 25:16.931
Gonna do my best.

25:20.379 --> 25:21.758
Looking good.

25:48.896 --> 25:50.448
How's it looking
down there, Rick?

25:56.793 --> 25:58.137
I'm excited for that.

25:59.965 --> 26:02.241
<i>Do you see any gold yet
down there, Rick?</i>

26:05.689 --> 26:07.000
No pressure.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.827
It's just my birthday,
I just wanted gold
for my birthday.

26:16.862 --> 26:18.965
I'll be waiting.

26:21.655 --> 26:23.241
Psycho for gold.

26:26.517 --> 26:30.103
I'd like a nugget that's,
like, the size of, like,
a loaf of bread.

26:42.758 --> 26:44.448
Well he just said
he likes crumbly.

26:44.448 --> 26:45.724
He's seeing crumbly.

27:01.551 --> 27:02.689
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:06.965 --> 27:08.379
Whoo!

27:08.379 --> 27:10.379
Oh, my God.
That's a game changer.

27:12.275 --> 27:14.586
Whoo-hoo!
It is worth after all.

27:21.620 --> 27:23.172
<i>I mean, look at that.</i>

27:23.172 --> 27:25.068
I can't see it,
but I'm hearing it, loving it.

27:26.241 --> 27:27.655
Rick, I want a nugget
for my birthday,

27:27.655 --> 27:29.241
is it happening down there?

27:32.551 --> 27:34.103
But I want a nugget!

27:35.068 --> 27:36.379
Nuggy-nuggy-nuggy,
coming your way.

27:38.103 --> 27:40.482
I was worried,
I painted my nails gold

27:40.482 --> 27:42.655
and I have spandex on
for my birthday.

27:42.655 --> 27:44.655
I was worried
it'd be a jinx,

27:44.655 --> 27:46.379
'cause this morning
didn't go too well.

27:46.379 --> 27:48.931
Switched the spot,
now he's kicking butt,

27:48.931 --> 27:51.793
and taking names. Yeah.

27:51.793 --> 27:53.034
Kicking names
and taking butt.

27:53.034 --> 27:54.689
Nope.
Did it right the first time.

27:55.827 --> 27:57.137
I'm just excited.

28:05.827 --> 28:07.655
This is going way better
than I expected.

28:13.586 --> 28:15.000
<i>Ten miles west...</i>

28:23.034 --> 28:24.482
Really pisses me off.

28:24.482 --> 28:29.448
I was having a good day,
and then Kris Kelly
going to get

28:29.448 --> 28:31.827
bitch slapped
is what's going to happen.

28:33.344 --> 28:37.379
I got way too many years
invested into this
and way too much time

28:37.379 --> 28:41.344
and way too much money
and way too many people
that count on me

28:41.344 --> 28:45.344
to risk it over
Kris Kelly's stupid antics.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.206
I just got
the excavator up and running.

28:51.206 --> 28:53.586
Everything's going
really nice right now.

28:53.586 --> 28:54.965
So here we go.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.275
Hello?

29:00.275 --> 29:02.206
Hey, is this James?

29:02.206 --> 29:03.724
No, this is Kris.

29:04.103 --> 29:05.344
It's Shawn.

29:07.517 --> 29:09.068
What are you up to?

29:09.068 --> 29:12.586
You know
you're violating
the DEC permits

29:12.586 --> 29:15.689
by coming this close to me.

29:15.689 --> 29:19.172
No, dude,
our boat was here
before you even got out here.

29:19.172 --> 29:20.275
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:20.275 --> 29:21.655
<i>Do you know the rules?</i>

29:21.655 --> 29:23.896
Do you know the regulations?

29:23.896 --> 29:25.862
Okay, that's enough
of that conversation.

29:31.896 --> 29:34.034
<i>We were already
mining here before.</i>

29:35.172 --> 29:36.655
Hung up on me.

29:36.655 --> 29:38.862
He's a chicken
little [bleep].

29:40.896 --> 29:42.310
I don't know.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.000
Details.

29:45.137 --> 29:48.137
If brains
were dynamite,

29:48.137 --> 29:51.241
Kris Kelly wouldn't have
enough to blow
his [bleep] nose.

29:52.931 --> 29:54.206
[bleep] this guy.

29:54.206 --> 29:55.793
We were [bleep] here first.

29:55.793 --> 29:58.551
I've got that video of him
working right next to me, too.

29:58.551 --> 30:00.965
Everybody keeps telling me
to go to the Coast Guard

30:00.965 --> 30:05.137
and tell the DNR that
he was illegally mining
next to us.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.689
We were a half mile
down to the east,

30:08.689 --> 30:12.000
Kris comes in with
The Mistress, jumps on us.

30:13.517 --> 30:15.068
So, we move back down here,

30:15.068 --> 30:18.034
he comes back down here,
jumps on us down here.

30:18.034 --> 30:20.206
What he's doing ain't
cool,

30:20.206 --> 30:22.000
it ain't legal,
it ain't right.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.068
So what Shawn's
trying to do right now,

30:24.068 --> 30:26.896
he's trying to work
backwards and trying
to cut me off from my line.

30:26.896 --> 30:28.517
So I'm going to keep
working the way

30:28.517 --> 30:31.137
I was working anyways
'cause that's where
we're going.

30:31.137 --> 30:33.758
I mean,
he got [bleep] down there
all the way

30:33.758 --> 30:37.896
down to there to mine,
and he's got to back
right into us.

30:37.896 --> 30:40.448
You know, miners have
an etiquette where,
you know,

30:40.448 --> 30:42.689
if you see one person
on a line getting gold,

30:42.689 --> 30:44.275
you don't try to block
them off.

30:44.275 --> 30:47.241
Shawn doesn't
have any etiquette at all.

30:47.241 --> 30:49.620
You know,
he's actually a [bleep].

30:51.448 --> 30:53.379
All right,
you little [bleep].

30:55.103 --> 30:56.448
He just wants to block me.

30:58.241 --> 31:00.172
Here we go,
it's probably a text
message from him.

31:00.172 --> 31:02.172
It is a text message from him.

31:02.172 --> 31:04.758
I just sent him a couple
of nice messages saying,

31:04.758 --> 31:06.482
"Hey, think about
what you're doing.

31:06.482 --> 31:08.413
Don't [bleep] this up
for everybody."

31:08.413 --> 31:10.827
I will get you kicked off
the claim because

31:10.827 --> 31:14.655
you and I both know
you're not on the APMA.

31:14.655 --> 31:16.620
That's delusional.

31:16.620 --> 31:18.620
You know,
who does that, anyway?

31:18.620 --> 31:23.103
Hopefully, he uses his head
and [bleep] pulls out of here.

31:23.724 --> 31:24.862
And you know what?

31:24.862 --> 31:26.931
When people try
to threaten you
on text messages,

31:26.931 --> 31:28.206
you don't reply.

31:28.206 --> 31:31.000
You just let them
just sit there and stew.

31:38.241 --> 31:40.241
Go [bleep] yourself.

31:40.241 --> 31:41.793
All right,
you little [bleep].

31:41.793 --> 31:43.034
That's it.

31:47.793 --> 31:50.413
He's just trying to bluff me
right now, dude.

31:50.413 --> 31:51.620
Listen to this.

31:51.620 --> 31:54.172
I have the police
waiting at the dock.

31:54.172 --> 31:57.689
James is the only guy
on the boat that
can be on there.

31:57.689 --> 32:01.068
If you keep pushing it,
I will shut you down.

32:01.068 --> 32:03.931
He's just
threatening me right now.

32:07.379 --> 32:09.931
So now he's telling me
he doesn't want to come here.

32:09.931 --> 32:12.448
"We have already mined
the [bleep] out of that area.

32:12.448 --> 32:17.034
Don't be an [bleep] idiot
and [bleep] this up
for everyone.

32:17.034 --> 32:18.862
Stay away and think about it."

32:18.862 --> 32:20.655
Of course, he wants to go
where I'm going.

32:20.655 --> 32:23.206
We wouldn't be parked
here for two days
if there wasn't gold.

32:23.206 --> 32:24.275
And he knows it.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.172
He knows we're trying
to defend our area,

32:26.172 --> 32:29.206
and I'm gonna keep
going there mining.

32:29.206 --> 32:32.586
He can take that barge
and ram it right up
his [bleep] ass.

32:32.586 --> 32:36.241
I'm trying to [bleep] talk
some sense into Kris Kelly,

32:36.241 --> 32:38.655
but he's so [bleep] stupid.

32:38.655 --> 32:41.310
Shawn's just pissed off
it didn't take me

32:41.310 --> 32:45.034
three generations of my family
to get to Shawn's spot.

32:45.034 --> 32:47.586
So you know what?
I know it's a piss off,
you know?

32:47.586 --> 32:50.275
But whatever,
I'm here and I'm not
going anywhere.

32:50.275 --> 32:51.379
Oh, maybe.

32:51.379 --> 32:54.206
Hopefully,
he has enough [bleep]...

32:54.206 --> 32:57.586
enough common sense
to [bleep] go, "All right.

32:57.586 --> 33:01.482
He's right."
He knows that I am.

33:02.793 --> 33:05.862
Man, Shawn's
a petty [bleep], huh?

33:05.862 --> 33:07.310
him.

33:20.862 --> 33:22.344
Why did we stop digging?

33:27.137 --> 33:28.793
Why did we stop digging?

33:42.310 --> 33:43.827
Bad time to break down.

33:43.827 --> 33:45.586
Shawn's moving in on us.

33:48.793 --> 33:50.172
It looks like
he's shut down

33:50.172 --> 33:52.482
and either he read
my messages

33:52.482 --> 33:55.068
and is taking my advice
or he broke down.

33:55.068 --> 33:56.482
I don't know what...

33:56.482 --> 33:58.793
what's going on,
but hopefully

33:59.965 --> 34:04.620
he's using his little
tiny piss ass brain

34:04.620 --> 34:06.586
to [bleep] make
a good decision.

34:08.379 --> 34:09.896
But I doubt it.

34:28.620 --> 34:29.827
What's the matter?

34:38.517 --> 34:40.344
Fuel injector again.

34:43.862 --> 34:45.482
It doesn't stop.
I swear to God.

34:45.482 --> 34:46.655
It doesn't stop.

34:46.655 --> 34:48.724
<i>Just when I think
everything is going right,</i>

34:48.724 --> 34:51.000
<i>then everything takes
a</i>[bleep] <i>on me.</i>

34:51.931 --> 34:54.413
Red toolkit as well!

34:57.517 --> 34:58.620
<i>We can't be
broken down.</i>

34:58.620 --> 35:00.827
Not now.
Not this time.

35:00.827 --> 35:03.551
James, I hope
we get this fixed right away.

35:03.551 --> 35:05.000
Shawn's closing in on us.

35:06.482 --> 35:08.241
Now we look like
we're broken down.

35:08.241 --> 35:10.448
Hey, Mike.

35:10.448 --> 35:12.206
Keep the water plant going.

35:12.206 --> 35:13.379
You told me to turn it off.

35:13.379 --> 35:14.689
Well, keep it going.

35:16.827 --> 35:17.862
No.

35:17.862 --> 35:19.551
No?

35:19.551 --> 35:20.827
They already shut it down.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.793
Hey, Mike.

35:22.793 --> 35:24.448
Well, dude, we could have
made it look like

35:24.448 --> 35:26.241
we were still working,
you know?

35:26.241 --> 35:28.758
I just wanted
the water off,
not the shaker.

35:32.448 --> 35:34.172
Now the piranhas
are coming.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.310
Yeah. Shawn's trying to tell
me he dug here years ago

35:39.310 --> 35:41.206
and emptied this
whole place out.

35:41.206 --> 35:44.862
He just wants us to move,
and he jumps in
and steals our gold.

35:46.172 --> 35:47.551
[bleep] him twice.

35:49.310 --> 35:51.241
So what are we going
to do to fix this?

35:53.379 --> 35:56.620
I'm going to tighten
up all the electrical
connections again.

35:57.896 --> 35:59.655
Just the same thing
as before?

35:59.655 --> 36:01.000
Mm-hmm.

36:02.172 --> 36:04.103
Yeah,
it keeps going loose, huh?

36:04.103 --> 36:06.482
That's so weird.

36:06.482 --> 36:10.034
Well, even if we have
to tighten it up every hour
and a half for five minutes,

36:10.034 --> 36:11.931
you know, it won't be
the end of the world.

36:11.931 --> 36:13.551
Okay, we'll go start it.

36:19.103 --> 36:20.310
Come on.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.517
We literally got
to get going here.

36:29.482 --> 36:30.793
What do you think?

36:31.931 --> 36:33.000
No good?

36:39.655 --> 36:41.827
So bad injector, huh?

36:46.137 --> 36:47.413
So we're screwed.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.172
I'm going to get Diesel
Don out here,

36:49.172 --> 36:51.793
and I'm going to beg him
to get this fixed immediately.

36:51.793 --> 36:53.275
<i>It is a bit overwhelming.</i>

36:53.275 --> 36:54.793
<i>Shawn is bearing down on us.</i>

36:54.793 --> 36:57.034
I owe a ton of money
at the end of the month.

36:57.034 --> 36:59.793
This whole operation
is going down in flames.

37:08.862 --> 37:11.103
Here, read these messages
from Shawn.

37:11.931 --> 37:13.586
I'm not replying back
to them.

37:13.586 --> 37:15.275
Go ahead and read them.

37:15.275 --> 37:18.620
As soon as you do,
I'll go take it off
to go to go get on Don.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.137
I don't know
what's up with that dude.

37:20.137 --> 37:21.482
He's delusional.

37:21.482 --> 37:23.620
Doesn't matter
if you're on the boat.

37:23.620 --> 37:26.241
I am on the paperwork.

37:26.241 --> 37:27.896
Anybody else can be on this.

37:27.896 --> 37:29.896
Don't worry, buddy.
Yeah, yeah. I know.

37:29.896 --> 37:31.482
He's whacked in the head.

37:31.482 --> 37:32.689
Whack, dude.

37:32.689 --> 37:34.586
Doesn't matter.
I know I'm on the bit.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.586
And he can't say
because I am on that.

37:36.586 --> 37:38.482
I know you are.
Okay, I'm going.

37:41.034 --> 37:42.620
Take half off one.

37:42.620 --> 37:44.551
Hey, cast off.
Cast off two.

37:45.551 --> 37:47.000
Hey, we'll be right back.

37:52.620 --> 37:54.896
The situation is intense.

37:54.896 --> 37:59.206
We're rushing back to town
right now to get my mechanic.

37:59.206 --> 38:03.310
Right now, I got Shawn
being a [bleep] head,
trying to close in on me.

38:03.310 --> 38:06.586
They tried to tell me that
I'm not supposed to be
there legally.

38:06.586 --> 38:08.482
Shawn right now
is delusional,

38:08.482 --> 38:10.827
I think he better get
on some head meds
or something.

38:10.827 --> 38:12.482
I don't know
what's up with him.

38:14.517 --> 38:16.275
I'm gonna ask my brother
to come out with me.

38:16.275 --> 38:19.482
And if it's going to turn
into a fight

38:19.482 --> 38:22.172
and he's a good person
to have in your corner.

38:22.172 --> 38:24.172
If it's going to get
into some pirate [bleep],

38:24.172 --> 38:26.689
you've got to have
one of your best
people with you.

38:26.689 --> 38:28.724
If you're not ready
to fight it out

38:28.724 --> 38:31.344
and to fight
for what you have,

38:31.344 --> 38:33.793
you're not going
to make it as a miner.

38:33.793 --> 38:36.068
You know,
mining is a tough industry.

38:36.068 --> 38:37.965
Everybody's trying
to [bleep] you over.

38:37.965 --> 38:40.103
Everybody's your competition.

38:40.103 --> 38:42.137
Nobody wants
to really help you.

38:42.137 --> 38:43.827
In the end, it's all on you.

38:43.827 --> 38:47.586
Your drive,
your make it or break it.

38:47.586 --> 38:50.827
<i>You know, got to be ready
to fight and defend
at a drop of a hat</i>

38:50.827 --> 38:52.793
<i>what you have
and what you want to keep.</i>

38:54.793 --> 39:00.482
<i>As the war
between Kris and Shawn
rages on, two miles east...</i>

39:11.241 --> 39:15.551
<i>The first half
of Vernon Adkison's A-team
is scoring big.</i>

39:27.172 --> 39:30.448
I'll tell you what,
on that suit of yours,
I was thinking about,

39:30.448 --> 39:34.275
we ought to get a magic
marker and draw you in a...

39:34.275 --> 39:36.206
a tie.

39:36.206 --> 39:38.275
Like, I mean,
that's your office suit

39:38.275 --> 39:41.896
and you're in your office
and you really ought
to have a tie.

39:45.689 --> 39:48.862
This season has been rough,
to put it mildly.

39:48.862 --> 39:50.862
<i>But finally,
there's some hope.</i>

39:50.862 --> 39:54.655
<i>I've got the band
back together with Gary
and Bryan both diving,</i>

39:54.655 --> 39:56.413
<i>and we're on the gold.</i>

39:56.413 --> 40:02.551
I need them to crush it today
and really every last day
for the rest of the summer.

40:02.551 --> 40:05.103
All right, Gary,
you got your time, man.

40:11.758 --> 40:13.172
It's been a while.

40:13.172 --> 40:14.482
Going back in.

40:16.172 --> 40:18.448
That's it. I'm feeling good.
No problem.

40:18.448 --> 40:20.103
I'm going to get some gold.

40:20.103 --> 40:22.793
<i>Gary just got in a good dive.</i>

40:22.793 --> 40:25.310
And so now
we'll send Bryan down

40:25.310 --> 40:27.448
<i>and he'll take it up
with Gary up top.</i>

40:27.448 --> 40:31.862
And hopefully, we'll get into
some really good ground
before it's over with.

40:31.862 --> 40:33.034
Okay.

40:33.034 --> 40:34.655
<i>I've was seeing quite
a bit of gold down there.</i>

40:34.655 --> 40:37.068
So we're on a good spot.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.551
Just got
to keep on following through.

40:52.827 --> 40:54.862
We got another diver down.

41:06.862 --> 41:08.275
Hey, Bryan.

41:08.275 --> 41:09.896
How did the material look?

41:24.827 --> 41:26.413
Well, keep plugging away.

41:26.413 --> 41:29.724
We'll hit a streak
before it's over with,
then we can follow it.

41:29.724 --> 41:31.206
You know,
you start getting greedy

41:31.206 --> 41:34.103
and jump around
all over the place,

41:34.103 --> 41:36.310
that's how you end up
worse off.

42:00.724 --> 42:04.137
Okay. Well,
I'll leave you alone
and let you get back to work.

42:09.517 --> 42:13.344
We've got some gold,
but we'll see how it goes.

42:13.344 --> 42:17.793
Both aces, both diving,
both on the gold.

42:17.793 --> 42:19.517
First time for the season.

42:19.517 --> 42:22.344
<i>It's about damn time
and not a moment too soon.</i>

42:22.344 --> 42:25.551
This could be exactly
what we need
to turn our season around.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.206
We'll make some gold today.

42:35.206 --> 42:37.241
And we're doing
better than last time.

42:37.241 --> 42:39.620
That's for damn sure.

42:51.103 --> 42:52.655
Are you still happy
down there?

42:52.655 --> 42:54.034
Oh, [bleep] yeah.

42:57.724 --> 42:59.931
<i>On the Greenhorn's
first day tending,</i>

42:59.931 --> 43:03.724
<i>gold is getting delivered
to the Jane station.</i>

43:03.724 --> 43:07.482
Oh, wow, what a best birthday.
I did not expect.

43:12.241 --> 43:13.931
You cannot leave
any gold behind.

43:13.931 --> 43:15.103
That would be gross.

43:19.206 --> 43:23.241
Emily is gonna be super stoked
on what Rick
is hitting down there.

43:23.241 --> 43:25.689
He is like going on and on.

43:29.551 --> 43:32.034
A lot of "yeah, baby,"
a lot of "[bleep] yeah."

43:32.034 --> 43:34.689
A lot of like,
"I'm getting gold
out of this crack."

43:34.689 --> 43:37.000
A lot of it's kind of sexual.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.448
But I don't frickin' care.

43:39.448 --> 43:42.965
It's cold outside,
but I did wear my gold spandex

43:42.965 --> 43:47.172
'cause I thought maybe
it'd be a good luck charm,
and they were.

43:47.172 --> 43:49.034
Now I have to wear them.

43:49.034 --> 43:50.482
Also, Rick said show me
your [bleep].

43:50.482 --> 43:52.551
And I'm not going to do that
because I'm very married.

43:52.551 --> 43:55.275
But I can show him
my gold spandex.

43:58.793 --> 44:00.482
Hey, Emily's back.

44:03.827 --> 44:05.862
Emily's going to be stoked.

44:05.862 --> 44:07.793
I think you're going
to be happy.

44:07.793 --> 44:09.034
Yeah.

44:10.379 --> 44:11.896
<i>Really good.</i>

44:11.896 --> 44:16.448
<i>Exactly as soon as you left,
it's just really
taking off like...</i>

44:17.655 --> 44:18.965
...he just...
just kept talking to me.

44:20.724 --> 44:23.275
Well, I took my pants off.

44:23.275 --> 44:25.448
We found gold in the pan.

44:25.448 --> 44:29.379
Anytime it's crumbly
and he had a really good time
getting gold out of crack.

44:29.379 --> 44:31.655
So, really getting gold
out of crack.

44:33.655 --> 44:34.931
Oh. Thanks.

44:36.344 --> 44:38.310
Go to the ladder.

44:38.310 --> 44:41.068
Okay. Ooh.

44:41.068 --> 44:43.344
Ricks coming up to the...

44:43.344 --> 44:45.517
said he had something
to show me.

44:45.517 --> 44:46.931
Whoa.

44:51.344 --> 44:53.000
Whoa!

44:53.000 --> 44:55.137
Holy cow.

44:55.137 --> 44:57.172
Oh, my God.

44:57.172 --> 44:58.965
awesome.

44:58.965 --> 45:00.517
Gold!

45:00.517 --> 45:01.827
Good job.

45:01.827 --> 45:04.000
Can finally look at the
sluice box.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.655
Ricky popped up
and gave me some gold.

45:06.655 --> 45:08.689
It is a pretty one.

45:09.827 --> 45:11.172
Kind of
crushing it down there.

45:11.172 --> 45:13.344
He is crushing it down there.

45:13.344 --> 45:14.862
So, this is really exciting.

45:16.896 --> 45:18.689
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, dang.

45:18.689 --> 45:21.137
- Well...
- No. It's good up in here.

45:21.137 --> 45:23.000
Look, a lot of big flakes, too.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.793
Yeah.

45:24.793 --> 45:28.068
My eyes are blinded
by all the gold.

45:28.068 --> 45:29.689
Left Jane out here.

45:29.689 --> 45:32.000
Got on some good gold, so.
Good day.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.793
It's good to have
Jane out here.

45:33.793 --> 45:35.586
My first time here alone.

45:35.586 --> 45:37.103
It's really fun.

45:37.103 --> 45:39.275
I made Emily some money.

45:50.827 --> 45:52.379
Oh.

45:52.379 --> 45:53.482
- Clutsy.
- Yeah.

45:53.482 --> 45:54.758
That's why I say
it's great with you.

45:54.758 --> 45:56.275
God.

45:56.275 --> 45:57.724
Happy birthday, Jane.

45:57.724 --> 45:58.931
It's a party.

46:04.862 --> 46:06.344
Back in the harbor right now.

46:06.344 --> 46:07.448
I already called Don.

46:07.448 --> 46:09.655
He's seeing if he can
get out of work early.

46:09.655 --> 46:12.827
I called Andy,
Andy's gonna come down here
and we're gonna get out there.

46:12.827 --> 46:15.896
We're gonna fix the [bleep],
keep mining
like nothing's happening.

46:17.241 --> 46:19.344
<i>I got to get
the excavator fixed.</i>

46:19.344 --> 46:21.586
I got to get back
to mining ASAP.

46:21.586 --> 46:23.068
We got to get
Shawn away from us.

46:24.344 --> 46:26.000
<i>Shawn is just a footnote.</i>

46:26.000 --> 46:27.689
Shawn is just the competition.

46:27.689 --> 46:29.586
Shawn is just trying
to stop me.

46:29.586 --> 46:31.172
He can go [bleep] himself.

46:34.172 --> 46:36.586
I'm not even gonna
let that [bleep] bother me.

46:37.827 --> 46:38.896
Mind over matter.

46:38.896 --> 46:40.827
I don't mind
'cause he doesn't matter.

46:49.241 --> 46:52.034
<i>My brother called me
and said, "Come on down
on the barge</i>

46:52.034 --> 46:54.724
<i>that he's having some issues
with Shawn."</i>

46:55.793 --> 46:57.241
So here I am.

46:57.241 --> 46:58.793
Let the games begin.

47:04.862 --> 47:06.931
- I'm ready.
- Okay, good.

47:06.931 --> 47:08.862
Just a little problem today
on the ocean.

47:08.862 --> 47:10.241
Nothing big.

47:10.241 --> 47:12.551
Just Shawn trying to bully me.

47:12.551 --> 47:13.931
Oh, we can deal with that.

47:13.931 --> 47:16.068
Yeah. No, I know.
I'm not worried about it.

47:16.068 --> 47:17.413
That's the easy part.

47:18.965 --> 47:21.310
Here we go.
The cavalry has arrived.

47:25.724 --> 47:27.482
- Thank you, Don, for coming.
- Yep.

47:27.482 --> 47:29.137
It's an emergency.

47:29.137 --> 47:32.103
Shawn trying to close in on me
and threaten me with
the police and everything.

47:32.103 --> 47:33.413
The police.

47:33.413 --> 47:36.517
You know, he's a
cop calling peace of [bleep].

47:40.379 --> 47:42.000
No, 'cause he...
'Cause I broke down.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.034
And he thinks that
he can legally move
in right next to me.

47:47.034 --> 47:49.137
Don, check. Andy, check.

47:49.137 --> 47:51.344
Time to get back there
and get this going.

48:01.896 --> 48:03.620
See how close everybody is.

48:03.620 --> 48:04.965
Yeah.

48:13.034 --> 48:14.344
Stand by with the back.

48:14.344 --> 48:15.827
Stand by with the front.

48:19.413 --> 48:20.862
Okay, we're here.

48:22.413 --> 48:23.827
Hey, Don's the most important.

48:23.827 --> 48:26.206
Get him up on that barge.

48:26.206 --> 48:27.310
Come on, Grandpa.

48:27.310 --> 48:29.241
Hey, don't you show
respect to Don.

48:30.862 --> 48:33.103
Not even elders.
Don's the man.

48:33.103 --> 48:35.241
He's gonna
save my day right now.

48:36.931 --> 48:40.034
I need Don to fix this thing
like he's a Jedi mechanic.

48:40.034 --> 48:41.310
I need him right now.

48:41.310 --> 48:42.965
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

48:48.448 --> 48:50.034
Hey, Don.

48:50.034 --> 48:52.310
See how you see
a little trough in there?

48:52.310 --> 48:55.241
That's where it'll leak out
from there.

48:55.241 --> 48:58.448
I need Don's expertise
to really fix this injector.

48:58.448 --> 49:00.068
I've done everything I can.

49:00.068 --> 49:01.379
I don't know what I'm doing.

49:01.379 --> 49:02.793
I tried.

49:02.793 --> 49:05.413
I need him to fix it
so I can get back
on this gold.

49:05.413 --> 49:06.517
<i>We're in a hot spot.</i>

49:06.517 --> 49:08.275
<i>Shawn's trying to push us off.</i>

49:08.275 --> 49:10.724
him.
"Oh, I'm Shawn Steyn Cranky.

49:10.724 --> 49:12.448
This is my gold
I dug here before."

49:12.448 --> 49:14.000
Go [bleep] yourself.

49:18.275 --> 49:19.344
Let's start it up.

49:20.517 --> 49:22.000
Start it up.

49:33.034 --> 49:34.344
No.

49:35.896 --> 49:38.241
No, it didn't work.
Still says injector.

49:40.310 --> 49:41.448
Well...

49:50.103 --> 49:53.000
Our status is right now
is Don's having
a little trouble

49:53.000 --> 49:55.517
to fix everything
and I hope he gets it working.

49:55.517 --> 49:57.862
'Cause we're on the best gold
we've been on for the season,

49:57.862 --> 49:59.172
and I really need this
to pay out.

49:59.172 --> 50:00.896
I need this boat
to work right now.

50:02.724 --> 50:04.793
I am so sick of
this [bleep] thing.

50:18.482 --> 50:21.448
Hey Bryan, what's that ground
looking like?

50:25.103 --> 50:28.241
<i>After 6 hours
with a pair of aces
under the water.</i>

50:28.241 --> 50:32.448
<i>Vernon Adkinson's team
may have run
the gold well dry.</i>

50:36.137 --> 50:37.379
Hey, Bryan.

50:48.724 --> 50:52.344
There's an old saying
that I think it's dead
on for gold mining.

50:52.344 --> 50:55.034
Don't let perfect
be the enemy of good.

50:56.517 --> 50:58.000
<i>Was today perfect?</i>

50:58.000 --> 50:59.241
<i>Not entirely.</i>

50:59.241 --> 51:00.758
<i>But was it good?</i>

51:00.758 --> 51:03.034
Hell yeah. It was very good.

51:03.034 --> 51:06.103
I'll take days like this
until the cows come home.

51:07.275 --> 51:08.827
That was a good day's work.

51:08.827 --> 51:10.620
I'm satisfied.

51:10.620 --> 51:12.275
<i>We got out here.</i>

51:12.275 --> 51:14.241
<i>We got back in operation.</i>

51:14.241 --> 51:18.896
<i>We worked out a few wrinkles,
and we did put gold
in the box.</i>

51:18.896 --> 51:23.517
We've explored all around
a 55 foot radius of the boat.

51:23.517 --> 51:26.965
So tomorrow we'll come back,
try a different area.

51:26.965 --> 51:29.172
Saw gold.

51:29.172 --> 51:30.724
This is what we needed.

51:30.724 --> 51:32.724
The gold ship
is dialed in now.

51:32.724 --> 51:35.000
Not how you start,
but how you finish.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.655
We're set to finish strong.

51:37.862 --> 51:39.206
Anchor's up.

51:39.206 --> 51:40.689
Okay.

51:40.689 --> 51:41.965
Here we go.

51:43.103 --> 51:46.862
<i>Good day's work.
That's a golden dream.</i>

51:46.862 --> 51:49.034
While Vernon
calls it a day.

51:52.655 --> 51:54.379
<i>Ten miles west...</i>

52:00.000 --> 52:03.896
Sick and tired of dealing
with these [bleep] idiots.

52:08.206 --> 52:10.275
I'm gonna have Cody
go talk to him.

52:10.275 --> 52:14.206
Because if I go over there,
I might end up
choke slamming Kris Kelly.

52:14.206 --> 52:17.172
And I don't need
to go to jail or [bleep].

52:18.482 --> 52:20.344
I've got enough
to worry about.

52:21.689 --> 52:23.482
Hey, Cody,
you got your ears on?

52:23.482 --> 52:25.034
<i>Yeah.</i>

52:26.724 --> 52:29.827
Why don't you go over
and talk to the guys
and tell 'em that I...

52:29.827 --> 52:33.103
I... I'm gonna call
the DEC tomorrow

52:33.103 --> 52:35.827
if they don't back [bleep] up
and get away from me.

52:35.827 --> 52:40.517
<i>I've had about enough of it,
and they need to back
away from me and you.</i>

52:40.517 --> 52:43.034
<i>Or they're gonna
be in a world of hurt.</i>

52:58.896 --> 53:03.551
Well, swing by their
and say, "Hey, Shawn's calling
the DEC

53:03.551 --> 53:05.586
<i>'cause you guys
keep violating the permits.</i>

53:05.586 --> 53:08.172
So, you guys better
figure it out.

53:08.172 --> 53:10.034
Figure it out quick."

53:10.034 --> 53:12.896
Yeah, they're out
of their element now
and they need to back off.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.965
<i>Cody is gonna
go talk to 'em.</i>

53:16.965 --> 53:20.275
This is gonna come to a head,
and it could get
ugly out here.

53:20.275 --> 53:21.655
Real ugly.

53:21.655 --> 53:25.310
Kris Kelly, you better
wise up
and better wise up quick.

53:25.310 --> 53:27.689
<i>Otherwise, I'm gonna break
hell upon him.</i>

53:29.103 --> 53:30.862
<i>Over at the mistress...</i>

53:33.137 --> 53:35.275
<i>We're back up
and running.</i>

53:36.793 --> 53:38.034
Yeah!

53:38.034 --> 53:39.517
We're ready.

53:39.517 --> 53:41.379
Let's [bleep] go to work.

53:41.379 --> 53:43.241
Start this bitch up.

53:43.241 --> 53:45.758
We will not be stopped.

53:45.758 --> 53:47.793
Finally, we're all systems go.

53:47.793 --> 53:49.344
<i>Sometimes when you're down like this,</i>

53:49.344 --> 53:52.482
<i>it can cause your team
to lose focus and lose faith.</i>

53:52.482 --> 53:54.206
<i>So, I got to get
James pumped up</i>

53:54.206 --> 53:57.034
'cause we need that box
to be absolutely loaded.

53:57.034 --> 53:59.206
Old man,
your times are great.

53:59.206 --> 54:00.448
you're [bleep] your buckets.

54:00.448 --> 54:02.655
You've tripled the amount
of material you're running.

54:02.655 --> 54:03.758
Easy.

54:03.758 --> 54:05.344
- You're on [bleep] fire today.
- Oh.

54:05.344 --> 54:08.068
- You're doing
an amazing job, James.
- I want more. I want more.

54:08.068 --> 54:09.931
- Just in case I don't tell you
that enough.
- I want more.

54:09.931 --> 54:11.000
I am... I am done.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.689
We've got gold stacking up
in the box.

54:12.689 --> 54:14.310
Everything is [bleep] awesome.

54:19.827 --> 54:20.896
Watch this.

54:20.896 --> 54:22.655
They're gonna slam into us.

54:38.689 --> 54:41.344
We... we're literally here
the last couple of days.

55:10.758 --> 55:12.034
There's really nothing.

55:16.862 --> 55:18.862
We were out here
a couple of days ago

55:18.862 --> 55:21.827
before anybody
got out here, dude.

55:21.827 --> 55:23.310
We really have been.

55:26.689 --> 55:29.068
Well, I don't know.
I'm really trying
to be courteous.

55:29.068 --> 55:31.827
I'm really trying
to make it work, Cody,
I don't want to piss you off.

55:37.137 --> 55:38.413
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

55:38.413 --> 55:40.827
We've been trying to mine here
for the last couple of days.

55:40.827 --> 55:43.068
We just came right back
to our spot again.

55:43.068 --> 55:45.620
I'm trying to do
my best, buddy. I am.

55:47.758 --> 55:49.068
I'm not a snake.

55:49.068 --> 55:51.758
I swear to God,
I'm not trying to
cause problems.

55:56.620 --> 55:58.724
I'm... We're not trying
to be like that.

55:58.724 --> 56:00.724
We really aren't.

56:00.724 --> 56:02.965
I'm gonna...
From now on, we'll...

56:05.862 --> 56:07.517
Okay, we will.

56:07.517 --> 56:08.793
Okay.

56:08.793 --> 56:10.344
Ah, we will. I promise.

56:12.068 --> 56:14.172
But we're still not moving.

56:14.172 --> 56:15.896
- We're still not moving.
- Okay.

56:15.896 --> 56:17.206
Yeah.
We're staying right here.

56:17.206 --> 56:18.931
I don't give two [bleep].

56:18.931 --> 56:20.448
Okay, let's go.
Get in this thing.

56:20.448 --> 56:22.724
Start running material.

56:22.724 --> 56:24.241
We're not moving.
We've got...

56:24.241 --> 56:27.068
I've got just as much right
to be here as everybody else.

56:27.068 --> 56:28.620
<i>Screw them.</i>

56:28.620 --> 56:30.965
Yeah,
turn the wash plant on.

56:43.103 --> 56:46.931
And now he's going
right behind me to jump
on my line to keep going.

56:51.758 --> 56:53.034
Take video of that.

56:53.034 --> 56:54.275
You know, that's illegal.

56:54.275 --> 56:55.758
You know what?

56:55.758 --> 56:58.379
Everybody's just trying
to push me around out here.

57:00.344 --> 57:02.586
They're not allowed
to mine that close to me.

57:04.103 --> 57:06.620
And he was at the front,
then he moves to the back.

57:06.620 --> 57:08.137
This is

57:08.137 --> 57:10.689
- I'll be see them right...
- This is [bleep].

57:15.620 --> 57:18.689
So, Cody comes over
and tells me I'm a snake.

57:18.689 --> 57:21.000
And then
he does the snake move.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.482
We... he was way
the [bleep] over there.

57:23.482 --> 57:25.310
He dropped back on our line.

57:25.310 --> 57:28.241
Then he... came all the way
to us and then hopped us.

57:28.241 --> 57:30.862
That's against
the [bleep] law.

57:30.862 --> 57:32.482
They pulled
the same [bleep] to us

57:32.482 --> 57:34.793
a couple of ice seasons ago.

57:34.793 --> 57:36.517
We dropped on a good spot.

57:36.517 --> 57:38.344
Shawn moved up
right next to us.

57:38.344 --> 57:41.482
And he got in my face
like... like a little punk coward.

57:41.482 --> 57:43.137
Did you guys
come find us?

57:43.137 --> 57:45.103
- I got my...
- Did you find this?

57:45.103 --> 57:46.655
- No.
- Did you find it?

57:46.655 --> 57:48.896
- Hey, dude, I did...
- Did you find it?

57:48.896 --> 57:50.344
Did you find? Oh, wait.

57:50.344 --> 57:52.172
What are you gonna do,
you [bleep] idiot?

57:52.172 --> 57:54.793
- Hit me then. Go for it.
- I'm scared of you.

57:54.793 --> 57:56.068
- Yeah. You better be.
- Yeah.

57:56.068 --> 57:58.793
I'm [bleep] scared of you.
You [bleep].

58:01.965 --> 58:04.275
I don't want any problems.
I just want to go mining.

58:04.275 --> 58:07.517
These [bleep] think
they own the ocean.

58:07.517 --> 58:08.758
This is all [bleep].

58:08.758 --> 58:10.413
them all.

58:18.931 --> 58:20.965
So,
what's the story there, Bryan?

58:20.965 --> 58:22.758
Oh, we got
some weight to this one.
Looks good.

58:22.758 --> 58:24.620
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, this one helps.

58:24.620 --> 58:25.931
- Oh, yeah.
- That looks good.

58:25.931 --> 58:28.103
All right. That's some...
that's some color right there.

58:28.103 --> 58:29.206
All right.

58:29.206 --> 58:31.000
After a summer
filled with crap,

58:31.000 --> 58:35.137
we're finally starting
to see the kind of gold
I was expecting to see.

58:35.137 --> 58:39.482
<i>It took us a bit,
but now we've got
the A-Team back together.</i>

58:39.482 --> 58:43.965
The gold ship is dialed in,
and we're
a gold getting machine.

58:43.965 --> 58:45.448
- Welcome back, Gary.
- Thank you.

58:45.448 --> 58:48.137
I mean, from the look
of that gold... Yeah.

58:48.137 --> 58:49.862
- Welcome back.
- Looks good. Yeah. Looks good.

58:49.862 --> 58:52.551
I mean, I think Bryan
might be picking up his game.

58:52.551 --> 58:54.034
- So, if you're back in.
- Bryan, yeah.

58:54.034 --> 58:55.275
- Yeah.
- That's good. That's okay.

58:55.275 --> 58:57.172
You know,
that's good.
I mean, the two of you...

58:57.172 --> 58:59.241
Yeah, that's...
that's working out
real good for me.

58:59.241 --> 59:01.655
- A little bit of competition
going on there.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

59:01.655 --> 59:03.413
Go, bring it on,
Bryan. Let's pour it up.

59:03.413 --> 59:04.965
All right.

59:08.689 --> 59:10.724
One, two, three...

59:10.724 --> 59:11.862
- Three.
- All right.

59:11.862 --> 59:13.793
Five.

59:13.793 --> 59:15.000
- Whoo!

59:15.000 --> 59:16.275
- Seven.
- Seven.

59:16.275 --> 59:17.862
Almost 7.7.

59:17.862 --> 59:22.103
<i>7.7 ounces
is worth over $13,000.</i>

59:22.103 --> 59:26.482
<i>Not a jackpot,
but the best output
the gold ship's seen in weeks.</i>

59:26.482 --> 59:29.448
- Wow. Oh, yeah.
Now we're talking.
- Yes.

59:29.448 --> 59:31.241
Would I have preferred
20 ounces?

59:31.241 --> 59:34.137
Yes, of course.
But this is a healthy pour.

59:34.137 --> 59:36.896
<i>This puts us on track
for the rest of the season.</i>

59:36.896 --> 59:39.275
Now let's kick it
into overdrive.

59:39.275 --> 59:42.000
- Good to get Gary back.
That's for sure.
- Yeah, yeah.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.310
My gold doggy.

59:44.310 --> 59:46.724
Mustache Gary.

59:46.724 --> 59:48.172
If it wasn't
for that mustache,

59:48.172 --> 59:49.758
I might give you
a little smooch.

59:49.758 --> 59:52.034
Oh, we can do that.
Give me some, anyway.

59:52.034 --> 59:54.000
- It's looking good.
- That's looking great.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.896
- Yeah, yeah.
- We got a good team.

59:55.896 --> 59:57.103
Yeah.

59:57.103 --> 59:58.724
The rig
is working real good.

59:58.724 --> 1:00:00.655
Putting it all together.

1:00:00.655 --> 1:00:03.793
I'd say, yeah, we're hitting
on all cylinders right now.

1:00:05.103 --> 1:00:06.586
<i>Jag it and bag it.</i>

1:00:08.965 --> 1:00:10.620
<i>On the outskirts of Nome...</i>

1:00:12.793 --> 1:00:15.137
Don't fear.
The fishanator is here.

1:00:15.137 --> 1:00:18.655
<i>The birthday festivities
are already off the hook.</i>

1:00:18.655 --> 1:00:20.758
Once I get
my lines sorted out,

1:00:20.758 --> 1:00:23.724
I'm a real threat
to the fishing population.

1:00:23.724 --> 1:00:25.379
Whoo! Whoo!

1:00:27.068 --> 1:00:29.034
You see how far that went?

1:00:29.034 --> 1:00:31.586
Jane's my lady and I
want her to have

1:00:31.586 --> 1:00:34.172
the full Nome
birthday experience.

1:00:34.172 --> 1:00:37.068
<i>I already gave Jane
a sweet nugget
for her hard work,</i>

1:00:37.068 --> 1:00:41.103
<i>but we got to do something
more like Jane's style here.</i>

1:00:41.103 --> 1:00:44.724
So, we got drinking,
fishing and a beach bonfire.

1:00:44.724 --> 1:00:46.655
I did see a fish out there.

1:00:46.655 --> 1:00:51.344
We're here to catch fish
for Jane's birthday bonfire.

1:00:51.344 --> 1:00:53.241
One of us knows how to fish.

1:00:53.241 --> 1:00:56.655
It's not me, but, you know,
I'm just along for the ride.

1:00:56.655 --> 1:00:57.896
But Jane really likes it.

1:00:57.896 --> 1:00:59.103
And it's her birthday.

1:00:59.103 --> 1:01:01.241
I really like fishing.
I like eating fish.

1:01:01.241 --> 1:01:04.034
It looks like my ideal way
of spending my birthday.

1:01:04.034 --> 1:01:05.206
I don't know if it's Emily's.

1:01:05.206 --> 1:01:07.344
I've gotten worse
since last time.

1:01:07.344 --> 1:01:08.724
I don't know
how that happened.

1:01:08.724 --> 1:01:10.620
But when she catches a fish,
she'll love it.

1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:12.344
Ooh, right there.

1:01:12.344 --> 1:01:13.896
Oh, oh.

1:01:13.896 --> 1:01:15.344
We've got a fish.

1:01:15.344 --> 1:01:17.068
- Finally.
- Come on, fishy.

1:01:17.068 --> 1:01:18.379
Come on.

1:01:18.379 --> 1:01:20.137
Oh, yeah. You got them.

1:01:20.137 --> 1:01:22.620
Oh, my gosh.
That's a perfect size.

1:01:22.620 --> 1:01:23.862
Sorry, fish.

1:01:23.862 --> 1:01:26.586
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh.

1:01:26.586 --> 1:01:28.344
We got him...
we want him dead right away.

1:01:28.344 --> 1:01:29.551
That's how it's caught.

1:01:29.551 --> 1:01:31.103
Look, the other side
will be beautiful. See.

1:01:31.103 --> 1:01:33.517
- Nice.
- That's it.
Oh, my gosh. That's it.

1:01:33.517 --> 1:01:34.931
See...

1:01:36.344 --> 1:01:38.551
Just they don't like to die.

1:01:38.551 --> 1:01:40.448
I think it's dead now.

1:01:40.448 --> 1:01:43.551
I just feel like I just met
you all over again, Jane.

1:01:43.551 --> 1:01:44.862
Getting out my aggression.

1:01:46.724 --> 1:01:49.206
I like murdered its face,
and it's still moving around.

1:01:49.206 --> 1:01:51.000
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:52.206
Thank you, fish.

1:01:55.965 --> 1:01:57.448
That really
should have got it here.

1:01:57.448 --> 1:01:58.586
Got away.

1:01:58.586 --> 1:01:59.827
Where's that knife of yours?

1:01:59.827 --> 1:02:01.310
Sometimes I feel like
a serial killer.

1:02:02.517 --> 1:02:04.793
I wonder why.
That's a good birthday fish.

1:02:04.793 --> 1:02:06.655
- It is.
- Nice fat trout.

1:02:06.655 --> 1:02:07.862
This is awesome.

1:02:10.586 --> 1:02:12.482
Jane,
you're a barbarian.

1:02:12.482 --> 1:02:14.206
That's the biggest
grayling I've ever caught.

1:02:15.655 --> 1:02:17.000
You got the grayling?

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.586
Grayling.

1:02:18.586 --> 1:02:19.965
It'll be tasty.

1:02:19.965 --> 1:02:22.448
Now, we got
one nice fat trout.

1:02:22.448 --> 1:02:24.344
Jane showed off her skills

1:02:24.344 --> 1:02:25.758
as a fisher lady.

1:02:25.758 --> 1:02:27.793
<i>And I think it's gonna be
a good bonfire.</i>

1:02:27.793 --> 1:02:29.724
She says her birthdays
are always epic,

1:02:29.724 --> 1:02:31.793
so that's what we're trying
to accomplish here.

1:02:31.793 --> 1:02:35.724
We got gold, we got fish,
and we're gonna have
a bonfire.

1:02:35.724 --> 1:02:37.793
It's my birthday.
And my birthday
is actually awesome,

1:02:37.793 --> 1:02:40.379
even though
it's kind of bad weather.

1:02:40.379 --> 1:02:41.586
But yeah, we're stoked.

1:02:41.586 --> 1:02:43.172
I mean, I'm stoked.

1:02:43.172 --> 1:02:44.862
Emily's gonna be stoked
when we eat the fish.

1:02:44.862 --> 1:02:46.448
I'm gonna
cook it up all nice.

1:02:46.448 --> 1:02:47.862
You got blood
on your face.

1:02:47.862 --> 1:02:49.206
That's hardcore.

1:02:49.206 --> 1:02:50.551
Oh, my God.

1:02:51.620 --> 1:02:52.758
I look horrible.

1:02:52.758 --> 1:02:55.172
My mom's gonna freak out
when she watches the episode.

1:02:56.448 --> 1:02:57.931
Shall we go
cook this fish?

1:02:57.931 --> 1:02:59.517
What's for dinner?

1:02:59.517 --> 1:03:00.896
Whoo!

1:03:04.551 --> 1:03:06.068
<i>Ten miles west...</i>

1:03:12.241 --> 1:03:14.206
<i>Cody, you got me?</i>

1:03:16.931 --> 1:03:20.517
How did your conversation
go with those morons?

1:03:39.620 --> 1:03:41.310
Yeah, I am, too.

1:03:41.310 --> 1:03:45.655
I'm about ready to just wait
at the harbor
for them to come in.

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.103
I've given these guys
chance after chance
after chance.

1:03:50.103 --> 1:03:51.689
I've tried to be calm.

1:03:51.689 --> 1:03:53.448
I've tried to be patient.

1:03:53.448 --> 1:03:56.862
<i>But when you interfere
with how we make
a living as gold miners,</i>

1:03:56.862 --> 1:03:58.344
<i>there's a limit.</i>

1:03:58.344 --> 1:04:01.758
Kris and his band of idiots
have just about reached
that with me.

1:04:03.172 --> 1:04:05.862
I'm about sick
and tired of Kris Kelly.

1:04:05.862 --> 1:04:08.620
He's gonna get a rude awakening.

1:04:11.241 --> 1:04:12.965
<i>Over at the mistress...</i>

1:04:20.758 --> 1:04:22.344
Oh, yeah.

1:04:25.310 --> 1:04:29.137
<i>Captain Kris
is enjoying the benefits
of staying his ground.</i>

1:04:31.724 --> 1:04:33.482
- It's still looking...
- Looking amazing.

1:04:33.482 --> 1:04:35.586
I mean, look,
we already got gold buildup.

1:04:35.586 --> 1:04:37.793
The buildups,
real buildups this time.

1:04:37.793 --> 1:04:39.862
This whole trough
is filled with gold.

1:04:39.862 --> 1:04:42.344
Look there,
there's a chunk of gold
in there.

1:04:42.344 --> 1:04:44.000
- More gold.
- That's all the way across?

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.793
That's all the way across.

1:04:45.793 --> 1:04:47.103
We're not leaving this spot.

1:04:47.103 --> 1:04:48.344
We're gonna have
to fight for it.

1:04:48.344 --> 1:04:50.241
They're just trying
to muscle us in right now.

1:04:50.241 --> 1:04:51.827
The gold is smoking here.

1:04:51.827 --> 1:04:53.620
The box is loaded.

1:04:53.620 --> 1:04:56.620
<i>This is what I've been waiting
for all season.</i>

1:04:56.620 --> 1:04:58.896
No one's getting us
off of here.

1:04:58.896 --> 1:05:00.586
Hey, Don, I really do...

1:05:00.586 --> 1:05:02.413
really appreciate
everything you do.

1:05:02.413 --> 1:05:04.482
Make some money, dude.
Make some money.

1:05:04.482 --> 1:05:05.793
<i>Now that
everything's working,</i>

1:05:05.793 --> 1:05:07.862
<i>Andy's going to take Don
back to town.</i>

1:05:07.862 --> 1:05:09.517
<i>Hopefully we can get both boats,</i>

1:05:09.517 --> 1:05:12.551
<i>The Reaper and the Mistress
on the water both
making money.</i>

1:05:12.551 --> 1:05:14.241
It's all coming together.

1:05:17.034 --> 1:05:18.896
Thank God I'm up and running.

1:05:18.896 --> 1:05:20.448
Everything's going good.

1:05:20.448 --> 1:05:22.379
I need to stay
on this momentum.

1:05:23.551 --> 1:05:24.724
<i>The crew's doing a great job.</i>

1:05:24.724 --> 1:05:27.137
<i>Everybody's working together
like a family.</i>

1:05:27.137 --> 1:05:29.068
That no matter
how hard it gets,

1:05:29.068 --> 1:05:33.620
we're all gonna stick together
and make sure
we finish this season strong.

1:05:33.620 --> 1:05:35.827
<i>We will not be stopped.</i>

1:05:46.344 --> 1:05:49.551
<i>We're in some good
looking material right now.</i>

1:05:49.551 --> 1:05:52.034
The kind dreams
are made out of.

1:05:52.034 --> 1:05:58.206
Things are going smooth,
and Myrtle's running
like fine wine.

1:05:58.206 --> 1:06:02.103
<i>The season has been
pretty rocky with numb nuts
on the Mistress.</i>

1:06:02.103 --> 1:06:03.965
But we're on
a good pay streak now.

1:06:03.965 --> 1:06:08.413
Despite all the distractions
and everything
that's been going on.

1:06:08.413 --> 1:06:10.448
It's turning yellow.

1:06:10.448 --> 1:06:12.586
We just need
to get more hours on it.

1:06:12.586 --> 1:06:14.275
You can see it.

1:06:15.758 --> 1:06:17.000
It's in there.

1:06:18.551 --> 1:06:20.724
<i>We're on probably
the best gold of the season.</i>

1:06:20.724 --> 1:06:23.482
That's why I can't deal
with all Kris' [bleep].

1:06:23.482 --> 1:06:25.965
<i>Our focus needs to be
on getting the gold.</i>

1:06:25.965 --> 1:06:28.103
Not dealing with
that whiny little [bleep].

1:06:37.275 --> 1:06:38.448
Anyway...

1:06:45.517 --> 1:06:47.724
Oh, we'll wait
at the [bleep] dock and...

1:06:47.724 --> 1:06:52.448
and wait until he's climbing
up the ladder
and then [bleep] grab him.

1:07:50.379 --> 1:07:52.310
<i>Off the coast of Nome...</i>

1:07:58.965 --> 1:08:01.137
You know what else
goes with a gas fire?

1:08:01.137 --> 1:08:02.379
Champagne.

1:08:02.379 --> 1:08:04.172
Everything goes
with a gas fire.

1:08:04.172 --> 1:08:05.758
Hmm.

1:08:07.931 --> 1:08:09.275
If it goes.

1:08:10.517 --> 1:08:11.620
Oh, there it goes.

1:08:11.620 --> 1:08:12.931
Oh.

1:08:12.931 --> 1:08:14.413
There's the fire.

1:08:14.413 --> 1:08:16.241
I think it's ready
to cook the fish on.

1:08:16.241 --> 1:08:17.620
Oh, yeah.
Let's put fish right on.

1:08:17.620 --> 1:08:19.551
Got to be ready in 30 seconds.

1:08:19.551 --> 1:08:20.862
This is nice.

1:08:20.862 --> 1:08:22.517
All right.
I got you some balloons.

1:08:22.517 --> 1:08:23.620
Is that cup cakes?

1:08:23.620 --> 1:08:24.724
I've got a pinata.

1:08:24.724 --> 1:08:26.758
What's in it? Gold?

1:08:26.758 --> 1:08:28.724
- Gold?
- Why not gold?

1:08:28.724 --> 1:08:30.137
- I mean...
- Really, Emily?

1:08:30.137 --> 1:08:31.344
There's no gold in it?

1:08:33.137 --> 1:08:34.586
You're having
a fun birthday so far?

1:08:34.586 --> 1:08:36.586
Yes. I'm having a blast.

1:08:41.482 --> 1:08:43.172
The cook needs champagne.

1:08:43.172 --> 1:08:44.620
Oh!

1:08:48.724 --> 1:08:51.379
This fish
is definitely very done.

1:08:51.379 --> 1:08:53.586
Doesn't look pretty,
but it'll taste pretty.

1:08:57.931 --> 1:08:59.689
- Good?
- Mm-hmm.

1:09:03.413 --> 1:09:05.482
Mmm. That's sandy but good.

1:09:05.482 --> 1:09:06.896
I'm also eating my hair.

1:09:08.482 --> 1:09:10.068
It's good
to have you up here.

1:09:10.068 --> 1:09:11.586
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1:09:11.586 --> 1:09:13.344
Definitely made life easier.

1:09:13.344 --> 1:09:15.517
Speaking of which,
I got a birthday present
for you.

1:09:15.517 --> 1:09:17.275
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

1:09:17.275 --> 1:09:21.551
I have no idea
what my birthday gift is
because it's Nome,

1:09:21.551 --> 1:09:23.413
and it's not like
there's a lot of
shopping around here.

1:09:24.724 --> 1:09:25.931
Happy birthday.

1:09:25.931 --> 1:09:27.310
No way.

1:09:27.310 --> 1:09:29.551
How do I not lose these
and lose everything?

1:09:29.551 --> 1:09:31.620
Oh, my God. Thank you.

1:09:31.620 --> 1:09:33.896
- That's so sweet of you.
- Yeah. Happy birthday.

1:09:33.896 --> 1:09:36.206
That's actually, um,
the nicest
birthday present ever.

1:09:36.206 --> 1:09:38.931
Oh. Just do a toast.
It's your birthday.

1:09:40.758 --> 1:09:44.034
- All right. Cheers.
Happy birthday.
- Oh. Thank you.

1:09:44.034 --> 1:09:46.068
Also, I'm pregnant.

1:09:46.068 --> 1:09:47.310
What?

1:09:48.586 --> 1:09:50.103
- No way, Emily.
- Yeah.

1:09:50.103 --> 1:09:52.758
So, it's why I'm drinking tea.
That's sad.

1:09:52.758 --> 1:09:55.241
- Oh. I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

1:09:56.896 --> 1:09:58.034
Oh, my goodness.

1:09:58.034 --> 1:10:00.172
Surprise. I'm pregnant.

1:10:00.172 --> 1:10:02.448
<i>I guess it's time
to let the cat out of the bag.</i>

1:10:02.448 --> 1:10:05.172
Or the kitten, so to speak.

1:10:05.172 --> 1:10:07.068
Yeah. I'm gonna need
some extra help on the boat

1:10:07.068 --> 1:10:09.620
'cause I'm not able to spend
as much time out there.

1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:11.379
- That's awesome.
- Oh.

1:10:14.689 --> 1:10:16.241
Oh, don't be... No, no.
Don't be emotional.

1:10:16.241 --> 1:10:17.724
Where's the cupcakes?

1:10:17.724 --> 1:10:20.172
You're eating for two,
and I'm drinking for two.

1:10:20.172 --> 1:10:22.965
<i>This is why
getting gold is so important.</i>

1:10:22.965 --> 1:10:24.551
Because I'm trying
to build a legacy here.

1:10:24.551 --> 1:10:26.275
It's not just
about me anymore.

1:10:26.275 --> 1:10:30.448
<i>Now I've got a husband
and a baby coming
and a family to provide for.</i>

1:10:30.448 --> 1:10:33.896
So, it's crucial that we have
a super profitable summer

1:10:33.896 --> 1:10:37.379
and that I have people
to help me out on the road
when I can't be there.

1:10:37.379 --> 1:10:38.793
Yo, it's pinata time.

1:10:38.793 --> 1:10:40.068
All right, now, swing.

1:10:40.068 --> 1:10:41.379
There you go.

1:10:43.862 --> 1:10:45.068
You can't tell me
you're pregnant

1:10:45.068 --> 1:10:46.448
then make me play this game.

1:10:50.965 --> 1:10:52.344
Oh, my God.

1:10:52.344 --> 1:10:54.241
That's not a pinata.

1:10:54.241 --> 1:10:55.413
You're pregnant.

1:10:55.413 --> 1:10:56.931
I'm not coming next to you.

1:10:56.931 --> 1:10:58.655
That's an abomination.

1:11:12.586 --> 1:11:16.103
Another day on the water,
should be going home.

1:11:16.103 --> 1:11:18.137
Spending some time
with my son.

1:11:18.137 --> 1:11:20.137
But here I am...

1:11:25.241 --> 1:11:27.620
...thinking about
strangling Kris Kelly.

1:11:29.586 --> 1:11:33.827
<i>I want to see him face to face
and see what he has
to say face to face.</i>

1:11:33.827 --> 1:11:35.620
'Cause he's always
got something to say

1:11:35.620 --> 1:11:39.310
when he's on a different boat
or 50 feet away.

1:11:39.310 --> 1:11:42.000
He's making
poor life choices right now

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.482
and he's
with the wrong [bleep] guy.

1:11:44.482 --> 1:11:47.517
Welcome to the Reaper Nation.

1:11:47.517 --> 1:11:50.000
The best ride in Nome.

1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.758
Fire her up.

1:11:52.758 --> 1:11:56.310
Aside from all
the problems that I've had,
it's been a great day,

1:11:56.310 --> 1:11:59.068
we got gold 'cause
that's our
main concern.

1:11:59.068 --> 1:12:01.103
Everything else
is just a bonus.

1:12:01.103 --> 1:12:02.758
<i>You know,
my team worked great.</i>

1:12:02.758 --> 1:12:04.068
<i>Don saved my life.</i>

1:12:04.068 --> 1:12:07.068
<i>We're getting gold.
Everything is</i>[bleep] <i>great.</i>

1:12:07.068 --> 1:12:09.000
They've [bleep] up
the way we're digging.

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.655
And our cuts.
They're [bleep]...

1:12:10.655 --> 1:12:12.758
they're
costing me money.

1:12:12.758 --> 1:12:15.689
And I don't have time
for Kris

1:12:15.689 --> 1:12:17.896
Kelly's antics
and bul [bleep].

1:12:20.172 --> 1:12:23.586
<i>I'm seeing
the best pocket
we've ever seen on this barge.</i>

1:12:23.586 --> 1:12:25.413
It's looking pretty nice.

1:12:25.413 --> 1:12:27.413
It's looking very nice.

1:12:27.413 --> 1:12:29.068
There's a lot of gold
in there.

1:12:29.068 --> 1:12:30.310
A lot of gold.

1:12:30.310 --> 1:12:32.275
Our best day of mining yet.

1:12:35.275 --> 1:12:39.793
Been out here
almost half my life working
to get where I'm at,

1:12:39.793 --> 1:12:44.344
not to have
some little weasely
ass named Kris Kelly come

1:12:44.344 --> 1:12:48.724
and [bleep] it up
by pulling stupid [bleep].

1:12:48.724 --> 1:12:51.827
There's all kinds of
ground to mine.

1:12:51.827 --> 1:12:54.413
But he's got to come
sit on top of us.

1:12:54.413 --> 1:12:58.344
Every [bleep] trip out.
You're gonna
put everything

1:12:58.344 --> 1:13:00.793
I've worked
my whole life for on the line

1:13:00.793 --> 1:13:04.068
because of
some little stupid

1:13:04.068 --> 1:13:06.448
that can't go
find his own [bleep].

1:13:06.448 --> 1:13:09.758
He's got to come jump on us
and [bleep] and mine

1:13:09.758 --> 1:13:11.586
right on our ass.

1:13:11.586 --> 1:13:13.000
No.

1:13:15.448 --> 1:13:18.000
You have a great night, too.
Don't let anything break down.

1:13:19.793 --> 1:13:21.862
<i>This is how
it's got to be from now on.</i>

1:13:21.862 --> 1:13:23.103
Work hard all day long.

1:13:23.103 --> 1:13:24.655
All my equipment runs.

1:13:24.655 --> 1:13:26.965
Night crew comes in.
They do their part.

1:13:26.965 --> 1:13:29.862
Double the gold
every single day.

1:13:29.862 --> 1:13:32.896
I've had [bleep] enough.

1:13:32.896 --> 1:13:36.000
I've had it [bleep] up
till here with Kris Kelly.

1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:41.068
He's been [bleep] around
and [bleep] around
for [bleep] years

1:13:41.068 --> 1:13:42.275
and I've let it go.

1:13:42.275 --> 1:13:45.448
But now the
he's pulling [bleep] matters.

1:13:45.448 --> 1:13:47.517
And I'm [bleep] tired of it.

1:13:47.517 --> 1:13:50.379
And we're gonna have
a little talk here.

1:13:50.379 --> 1:13:51.965
In just a [bleep] minute.

1:13:51.965 --> 1:13:53.931
<i>It was a long day.</i>

1:13:53.931 --> 1:13:55.448
Let me tell you that.

1:13:55.448 --> 1:13:57.689
I am so glad
for it to be over.

1:13:57.689 --> 1:14:01.551
Feels like I worked
like 20 hours today
for some reason.

1:14:01.551 --> 1:14:03.241
<i>Either he's gonna wise up</i>

1:14:03.241 --> 1:14:05.517
or I'm gonna
beat his ass.

1:14:05.517 --> 1:14:07.172
One of the two.

1:14:07.172 --> 1:14:08.586
Good job, everybody.

1:14:08.586 --> 1:14:10.758
You know, you guys
are some down [bleep].

1:14:10.758 --> 1:14:12.413
Good job.
James, you killed it today.

1:14:12.413 --> 1:14:14.620
Your best day yet.

1:14:14.620 --> 1:14:18.000
He's got a [bleep] mouth
when he's sitting
on a [bleep] another boat.

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.551
He can talk. Talk.

1:14:19.551 --> 1:14:22.379
But let's see
if he can walk the walk now.

1:14:24.413 --> 1:14:27.103
'Cause I'll take him,
Jesse and Andy,

1:14:27.103 --> 1:14:30.000
and [bleep] beat all three
of their asses
at the same time.

1:14:32.275 --> 1:14:33.931
I've had enough of it.

1:15:01.275 --> 1:15:03.275
I had about enough
of these [bleep].

1:15:05.206 --> 1:15:06.896
I'm done with them.

1:15:24.862 --> 1:15:28.310
Oh, you come on down here,
you fat [bleep].

1:15:33.448 --> 1:15:35.862
Andy, you come out
on the claim again,

1:15:35.862 --> 1:15:38.068
I'm gonna
call the police.

1:15:38.068 --> 1:15:39.655
No, [bleep] off, dude.

1:15:39.655 --> 1:15:42.344
No, you [bleep],
you dumb [bleep].

1:15:45.931 --> 1:15:48.413
What are you gonna
do?

1:15:48.413 --> 1:15:52.000
Get the
out of my face.

1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:53.793
Now, what are you gonna do?

1:15:53.793 --> 1:15:55.137
Come on.

1:16:17.241 --> 1:16:18.620
What is it?

1:16:23.724 --> 1:16:26.586
You know,
there were a lot of
shipwrecks along this coast.

1:16:26.586 --> 1:16:28.758
I don't know.
Maybe the Vikings
were up there.

1:16:28.758 --> 1:16:30.655
Maybe that was
one of their war horns.

1:16:30.655 --> 1:16:32.310
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:16:32.310 --> 1:16:34.793
Keep looking.
Maybe you'll find
the rest of it.

1:16:34.793 --> 1:16:37.137
Then we'll know
what's for dinner.

1:16:39.724 --> 1:16:41.034
Yeah, that's for sure.

1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:46.724
I found an old
sheriff's badge.

1:16:46.724 --> 1:16:48.068
Yeah.

1:16:48.068 --> 1:16:50.896
Never can tell
what you're gonna find
down there.

1:16:52.551 --> 1:16:54.689
That's probably
worth some money, so...

1:16:54.689 --> 1:16:57.068
Stick it in your boots.
Bring it up when you come.

1:16:59.275 --> 1:17:01.000
<i>All right. Good man.</i>

1:17:04.586 --> 1:17:06.724
What are you
gonna [bleep] do?

1:17:06.724 --> 1:17:10.586
Get the
out of my face.

1:17:10.586 --> 1:17:12.000
Yeah. What are you gonna do?

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:13.103
Come on.

1:17:13.103 --> 1:17:14.206
you up.

1:17:14.206 --> 1:17:15.482
Get the [bleep] away from me.

1:17:15.482 --> 1:17:17.034
What's going on?
I'm coming.

1:17:21.827 --> 1:17:22.931
Yeah.

1:17:25.896 --> 1:17:27.620
- Come on.
- You're done.

1:17:27.620 --> 1:17:29.068
Come on, [bleep].

1:17:29.068 --> 1:17:30.310
Oh, your [bleep] done.

1:17:30.310 --> 1:17:31.551
Yeah, fine.

1:17:31.551 --> 1:17:32.793
You stupid [bleep].

1:17:32.793 --> 1:17:34.620
Stupid [bleep] Come on.

1:17:34.620 --> 1:17:36.448
- Come on, Shawn.
- Oh, fine.

1:17:36.448 --> 1:17:38.689
Yeah, baby. [bleep].
It's go time.

1:17:38.689 --> 1:17:40.275
- What?
- You're gonna [bleep] hit me?

1:17:40.275 --> 1:17:41.379
Oh, yeah, dude.

1:17:41.379 --> 1:17:42.482
You're gonna [bleep] hit me?

1:17:42.482 --> 1:17:44.620
Yeah. What are you gonna do?

1:17:44.620 --> 1:17:45.793
