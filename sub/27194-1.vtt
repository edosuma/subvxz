We'll just get some Chinese.

even printed them.

sitting there.

- Did that work?
- No!

But it might if I keep trying.

07:24.019 --> 07:25.351
I don't know, Krissie. This is
getting serious.

07:25.428 --> 07:26.427
I've always slept well.

deep sleep.

07:29.007 --> 07:30.449

07:30.525 --> 07:32.692
And I have tried everything.

07:32.769 --> 07:34.602
Okay, how about
acupuncture?

07:34.680 --> 07:36.680
Acupuncture, acupressure,
hypnosis.

07:36.682 --> 07:37.847
- Drugs.
- Doxepin.

07:37.849 --> 07:40.107
Doxylamine. Diphenhydramine.

07:40.185 --> 07:41.518
Quazepam. Zolpidem.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.852
That's a lot of drugs.

07:42.854 --> 07:44.354
Krissie, what am I
going to do?

07:44.356 --> 07:46.690
I don't know, and to be honest,
your timing really sucks.

This is Josh's mother's fault.

07:55.124 --> 07:57.701

started when she decided

07:57.703 --> 07:58.977
to turn our wedding
into the New Year's Eve

07:59.054 --> 08:00.979
social event of the year.

08:01.056 --> 08:02.147

a big wedding.

08:02.224 --> 08:03.297
And if anyone
can pull it off...

08:03.375 --> 08:05.800
It should be me, I know.

08:05.877 --> 08:07.319

if I don't get any sleep,

08:07.395 --> 08:08.970

Mr. Ballsack again.

God. Though to be fair,

08:32.996 --> 08:34.087

- What's she got in her hand?
- No, no...

20:13.938 --> 20:14.828
- [all scream]
- It's just a shoe.

20:16.532 --> 20:18.883
[classical music playing]

20:18.960 --> 20:20.051
[phone rings]

20:24.131 --> 20:26.373
Hi, this is Blushing Bride.
How may we help you?

20:26.451 --> 20:30.286
Yes, madam. She is here.

20:30.288 --> 20:32.730
Yes, madam,
a little mad, perhaps.

20:34.141 --> 20:36.125
Okay.

20:36.127 --> 20:36.901
But will you be here soon?

20:36.978 --> 20:39.812
You're where? Oh, God.

20:42.650 --> 20:44.891
Fiona, I'm so sorry.

20:44.969 --> 20:46.986
Thank you so much
for bailing me out.

20:47.062 --> 20:48.821
Did you see
any nice dresses?

20:55.162 --> 20:55.869
Good talk.

20:58.649 --> 21:00.541
All right, that's it.

21:03.412 --> 21:04.920
[Christmas rock music playing]

21:16.667 --> 21:18.851
[indistinct chatter]

21:27.512 --> 21:28.736
[sniffs]

21:32.350 --> 21:34.016
Hi, one second.

21:34.018 --> 21:36.109
So if you get him to move
by Friday, paint them,

21:36.187 --> 21:37.778
have them to me
by Saturday afternoon.

21:37.855 --> 21:38.871
Think about it.
Boom, what do you want?

21:42.193 --> 21:44.785
Oh, yeah.

21:44.862 --> 21:47.696
My head still hurts.
Lucy? Lily?

21:47.698 --> 21:49.698
It's Lizzie. Vodka, please.

21:49.700 --> 21:50.799
Your name's Lizzie Vodka Please?

21:53.371 --> 21:54.461
Tough crowd. Okay.

21:54.539 --> 21:56.722
Ouch.

21:56.799 --> 22:00.133
So, Lizzie Not Vodka Please,

22:00.211 --> 22:01.544
is this a coincidence
you're in my bar?

22:01.546 --> 22:04.396
Here? Now that is funny.

22:04.473 --> 22:06.732
No, you told me
where you worked in the car

22:06.809 --> 22:08.884
the night we...

22:08.886 --> 22:10.811
- Slept together?
- Right.

22:10.888 --> 22:12.054
So apart from that night,
I haven't slept

22:12.056 --> 22:13.331
for more than two hours
in the last month,

22:13.407 --> 22:16.334
and I have tried everything
but nothing has worked.

22:16.410 --> 22:19.061
So the only possible conclusion
that I can come up with

22:19.063 --> 22:19.995
is that maybe...

22:22.233 --> 22:23.507
I only slept like that
because you were there.

22:23.584 --> 22:25.084
[laughs]

22:25.160 --> 22:28.420
You serious? That's ridiculous.
Why would I make you sleep?

22:28.497 --> 22:31.015
I don't know.
But you slept too.

22:31.092 --> 22:32.508
Do you normally
sleep like that?

22:33.928 --> 22:35.335
You don't, do you?
I knew it.

22:35.413 --> 22:38.171
Why else would you be jogging
at 3:00 in the morning?

22:38.249 --> 22:40.841
Why would you look like that
or work in a place like this?

22:40.918 --> 22:43.527
- Whoa, that's offensive.
- That was mean. I'm sorry.

22:43.604 --> 22:46.179
Maybe I was sleeping
because you ran me over

22:46.257 --> 22:47.756
- and knocked me unconscious--
- [Lizzie] Okay!

22:47.758 --> 22:51.610
You literally ran into my car.
That has nothing to do with it.

22:51.687 --> 22:53.537
It's beside the point.
We slept. We slept.

22:53.614 --> 22:54.279
And afterward,
didn't it feel amazing?

22:54.356 --> 22:55.931
Like you were alive?

22:55.933 --> 22:58.525
No, actually, it felt real weird
and I didn't feel like myself.

22:58.603 --> 23:01.027
Okay, well, not for me,
because when I haven't slept,

23:01.105 --> 23:02.529
I'm a nightmare.

23:02.607 --> 23:04.106
But when I have, I'm nice.

23:04.108 --> 23:06.867
I'm organized.
I am good at my job,

23:06.944 --> 23:08.201
which is what I want to be
all the time,

23:08.279 --> 23:09.795
but especially right now.

23:09.872 --> 23:10.704
- Because it's Christmas?
- Yes.

23:10.781 --> 23:12.038
But, no, not like that,

23:12.116 --> 23:14.374
because Christmas is my busiest
time of the year.

23:14.452 --> 23:16.376
And on top of that,

23:16.454 --> 23:17.895
I'm getting married
on New Year's Eve,

23:17.972 --> 23:20.139
which means I have
all of that to plan,

23:20.215 --> 23:21.899
which is impossible
when I'm like this.

23:21.976 --> 23:23.383
So, Billy, I guess
what I'm trying to ask is...

23:23.461 --> 23:24.518
oh, God.

23:27.222 --> 23:27.855
Will you please try
to sleep with me again?

23:32.803 --> 23:34.486
Are you a cop?

23:34.563 --> 23:36.822
What? No, why would I
be a cop?

23:36.899 --> 23:38.082
Okay, I'm sorry.
You're...

23:38.159 --> 23:39.900
I'm catching up.

23:39.977 --> 23:40.976
You're asking me
to sleep with you

23:40.978 --> 23:42.920
because you're getting married?

23:42.997 --> 23:44.980
- Yes.
- But with no sex.

23:44.982 --> 23:46.757
- No. No, ugh! Please.
- Bye-bye.

23:46.834 --> 23:48.575
[Lizzie]
Dude, just hear me out, okay?

23:48.653 --> 23:51.320
If it works, and if I actually
get some sleep,

23:51.322 --> 23:52.763
maybe that'll be a habit
and maybe I'll be cured.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.599
Lizzie, I'm sorry, I don't know
what type of meds you're on.

23:55.676 --> 23:58.827
- I'm not gonna sleep with you.
- Please! What if I paid you?

23:58.829 --> 24:01.421
What if we came up with some
kind of financial agreement--

24:01.499 --> 24:03.682
I'm not that type of girl.
I'm very sorry.

24:03.759 --> 24:05.091
I'm not going
to sleep with you.

24:05.169 --> 24:07.019
That is bananas.
What can I get you?

24:07.095 --> 24:09.021
Another beer? You look good.
You do something with your hair?

24:09.097 --> 24:11.840
- All right, I'll get you a beer.
- Call if you change your mind.

24:11.842 --> 24:13.676
- Anytime.
- Okay.

24:13.678 --> 24:15.194
You don't have to worry
about waking me up.

24:15.270 --> 24:16.862
Sounds good. Oh, I'll take care
of this one.

24:16.939 --> 24:17.621
Don't you worry.

24:24.355 --> 24:25.963
And her fiancé
is okay with that?

24:26.040 --> 24:28.190
I have no idea,
but this girl's a nutjob.

24:28.192 --> 24:29.633
[laughs]

24:29.710 --> 24:31.860
You and your schemes.

24:31.862 --> 24:33.471
No, no, not a scheme.
Not a scheme.

24:33.547 --> 24:34.805
Well, maybe it should be.

24:34.882 --> 24:36.307
No, Andy, she's crazy.

24:36.383 --> 24:39.643
You were the one who told me,
enough with the crazy chicks.

24:39.720 --> 24:41.386
Okay, well, yeah, I agree,
it's a little weird that,

24:41.463 --> 24:42.313
you know, she thinks
you made her sleep.

24:42.389 --> 24:44.982
But she seems
a little desperate.

24:45.059 --> 24:46.542
So? I know a lot
of desperate girls.

24:46.544 --> 24:48.486
Not desperate girls
offering money,

24:48.562 --> 24:50.562
which you can use
to open up Billy's Bar,

24:50.639 --> 24:52.731
which is your lifelong dream.

24:52.808 --> 24:54.399
Are you not getting
any of this?

24:54.476 --> 24:55.659
What are you-- ?

24:55.736 --> 24:56.827
Really, Billy?

25:02.317 --> 25:04.059
[honks horn]

25:04.061 --> 25:05.661
[scooter ignition turns off]

25:14.496 --> 25:16.013
- Ah!
- No! Asshole!

25:17.742 --> 25:19.183
Oh, my God!

25:19.260 --> 25:20.518
You should have seen
your face.

25:20.594 --> 25:24.263
You got to relax.
Well, I guess you don't know me.

25:24.339 --> 25:25.597
I could be a horrible person.

25:25.674 --> 25:27.099
I mean, you're not, right?

25:27.175 --> 25:29.268
Although you do drive that.

25:29.344 --> 25:30.602
I guess you're not
the brightest spark.

25:30.679 --> 25:33.197
Um, cars crash too.

25:33.274 --> 25:35.424
But, no, I'm not
a horrible person.

25:35.426 --> 25:37.684
- I got a few speeding tickets--
- Yeah, I know.

25:37.762 --> 25:39.762
I had a friend run
a background check on you.

25:39.764 --> 25:40.153
Oh, so you're
the horrible person.

25:42.024 --> 25:43.282
All right, let's just...

25:43.358 --> 25:45.934
let's just go over
what we agreed to on the phone.

25:45.936 --> 25:47.619
- Sure.
- If this works,

25:47.696 --> 25:49.362
which we both know
it almost certainly won't,

25:49.440 --> 25:52.032
then I'm going to sleep with you
until your wedding day.

25:52.109 --> 25:53.366
- December 31st.
- And in return,

25:53.444 --> 25:54.943
you're going to loan me
the money to start my bar.

25:54.945 --> 25:57.629
In exchange for 10%
of your new business venture,

25:57.706 --> 25:59.448
subject to a fully signed and
ratified contract.

25:59.450 --> 26:03.452
In anticipation, I had my lawyer
draw something up.

26:03.454 --> 26:04.061
Here you go.

26:06.048 --> 26:06.897
- Wow.
- What?

26:08.459 --> 26:11.143
Nothing. You're just a very
determined person.

26:11.219 --> 26:12.477
All this planning
is kind of scaring me.

26:12.554 --> 26:17.316
Okay, solving problems
and making plans isn't scary.

26:17.392 --> 26:19.301
It's grown-up.

26:19.303 --> 26:20.469
If you find growing up
threatening,

26:20.471 --> 26:22.971
then I feel sorry for you.

26:22.973 --> 26:24.415
Well, I feel sorry
for your fiancé.

26:24.491 --> 26:26.750
- Speaking of--
- Josh?

26:26.827 --> 26:28.902
Yeah. He's a lovely
and very trusting man

26:28.979 --> 26:31.146
who would agree with me.

26:31.148 --> 26:32.981
Although he is a surgeon
who works strange hours,

26:32.983 --> 26:34.333
so he will never need to know.

26:34.409 --> 26:37.077
Wow, that's beautiful.
Are those your wedding vows?

26:37.154 --> 26:38.670
Oh, yeah.
They are, actually.

26:42.509 --> 26:45.510
Okay, well, let's just see
if this crazy idea works.

26:47.589 --> 26:49.164
Seriously?

26:49.166 --> 26:50.015
Yeah.

26:53.170 --> 26:54.019
[sighs]

26:56.340 --> 26:57.522
How close do you think-- ?

26:57.599 --> 26:59.766
Yeah, I don't think we need
to be close at all.

26:59.844 --> 27:00.776
Just how we were last time.

27:03.939 --> 27:05.772
Well, do you want a drink?

27:05.850 --> 27:07.349
I made my own
sloe gin.

27:07.351 --> 27:08.684
No, thank you.
I'm good.

27:08.686 --> 27:10.202
Don't mind if I do.

27:13.190 --> 27:13.914
[Billy sighs]

27:19.287 --> 27:20.712
[sighs]

27:36.380 --> 27:37.988
- It's not working, is it?
- Nope.

27:38.065 --> 27:39.323
Oh, well.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.233
"Oh, well"?

27:41.309 --> 27:42.567
Well, if you relax,
maybe it would work.

27:42.644 --> 27:45.829
Oh, right, because nothing
is ever your fault.

27:48.392 --> 27:50.000
You know what?
You're right. It is my fault.

27:50.077 --> 27:52.318
Normally I can
satisfy a woman,

27:52.396 --> 27:54.004
but I'm getting
a little bit older.

27:54.081 --> 27:56.340
It's a little bit embarrassing,
to be honest.

27:56.417 --> 28:00.493
Well, Billy, if you can't
satisfy me, then it is all over.

28:00.571 --> 28:02.754
Well, I will do my best,
Your Highness.

28:06.744 --> 28:07.926
Good night.

28:08.003 --> 28:08.844
Good night.

28:23.594 --> 28:24.443
[cell phone vibrating]

28:30.951 --> 28:33.359
Oh, my God. It worked.

28:33.437 --> 28:34.861
It worked.

28:34.939 --> 28:36.329
Billy.

28:37.791 --> 28:39.291
- Billy.
- Aah!

28:39.367 --> 28:40.834
It's okay.

28:42.947 --> 28:44.780
I slept. We slept.
It worked.

28:44.782 --> 28:45.881
It did.

28:47.284 --> 28:48.133
It did. Why?

28:48.210 --> 28:51.544
I have no idea,
but it worked.

28:51.622 --> 28:53.564
Can you just never wake me up
like that again, please?

28:53.640 --> 28:57.125
Okay, can you just move
your little scooter thingy.

28:57.127 --> 28:58.293
[sighs]

28:58.295 --> 29:00.462
Let's go.

29:00.464 --> 29:01.964
[Revered Peter laughing]

29:01.966 --> 29:04.516
So will you be using traditional
vows or writing your own?

29:04.593 --> 29:06.818
- Writing our own. Right, honey?
- Yes.

29:06.895 --> 29:08.579
Actually, I've been researching
a few options.

29:08.655 --> 29:11.081
Hold on.
Hold your horses.

29:11.158 --> 29:12.732
Some people find it more
pleasant

29:12.810 --> 29:14.918
to hear each other's vows
as surprise.

29:14.995 --> 29:16.736
Oh, no, we don't like
surprises.

29:16.814 --> 29:18.830
- Oh, yeah.
- We like plans.

29:18.907 --> 29:20.257
We like plans, yeah.
I mean, it wasn't raining

29:20.334 --> 29:21.708
when Noah built the arc,
am I right?

29:23.487 --> 29:24.336
Delightful.

29:24.412 --> 29:26.746
[laughs]

29:26.824 --> 29:29.157
So let me get this straight.
You're like a gigolo,

29:29.159 --> 29:30.267
but without the sex.
I get it.

29:30.344 --> 29:31.751
Yeah, well, I don't get it.

29:31.829 --> 29:34.938
I mean, I haven't been able
to sleep properly in years.

29:35.015 --> 29:37.090
Decades, actually.
Now, all of a sudden, I can.

29:37.167 --> 29:38.776
And on top of that,

29:38.852 --> 29:40.093
Andy's bullying me
into borrowing money,

29:40.170 --> 29:41.353
rushing me to open
my own bar...

29:41.429 --> 29:43.021
Dude, she offered you money,

29:43.098 --> 29:45.449
and you've talked about opening
your own place for 10 years.

29:45.526 --> 29:49.177
It's hardly rushing.
And this spot is perfect.

29:49.179 --> 29:52.956
So, look, calm down.
You've slipped. You're paranoid.

29:53.033 --> 29:55.033
You're right.
You're right, 100%.

29:55.110 --> 29:56.293
It's so much easier
to think clearly when I'm tired.

29:58.689 --> 29:59.538
That's not good, is it?

29:59.614 --> 30:01.690
No, it's not good.

30:01.692 --> 30:03.133
This is a really bad idea,
Lizzie.

30:03.210 --> 30:04.876
Like, literally the worst idea
I have ever heard.

30:04.953 --> 30:08.305
It's really, really bad.
I just need you to know that.

30:08.382 --> 30:10.048
- Yeah, thanks.
- And even if it works now,

30:10.125 --> 30:11.475
what happens
after you're married?

30:11.552 --> 30:13.960
Are you just going to keep
sleeping with this other guy?

30:14.038 --> 30:15.704
Like, are you and Josh
just going to end up

30:15.706 --> 30:18.040
in some weird kind of threesome
with this other guy, like,

30:18.042 --> 30:20.058
curled up in a cot
beside your bed?

30:20.135 --> 30:22.044
What are you even
talking about?

30:22.046 --> 30:23.712
No, no, this is just
the wedding pressure

30:23.714 --> 30:24.971
causing me not to sleep, okay?

30:25.049 --> 30:26.472
Come on.

30:26.550 --> 30:27.883
And if you're wrong?

30:27.885 --> 30:30.052
If this barman
turns out to be

30:30.054 --> 30:30.494
the only person
you can sleep with?

30:30.571 --> 30:32.830
Then I...

30:47.571 --> 30:49.179
This girl is nuts.

30:52.242 --> 30:53.333
[grunts]

30:53.410 --> 30:54.426
[phone line rings]

31:00.342 --> 31:01.583
- [yells]
- Aah!

31:01.585 --> 31:03.768
- [laughs]
- Asshole.

31:03.845 --> 31:05.186
Come on, let's go.

31:07.107 --> 31:08.940
Give me a sec.

31:09.017 --> 31:12.777
All right, had my lawyers look
it over. Seems good to me.

31:12.854 --> 31:13.778
- You have lawyers?
- Yes, I have lawyers.

31:13.855 --> 31:15.855
I have good lawyers.

31:15.933 --> 31:17.875
Actually, I have
great lawyers.

31:17.951 --> 31:19.784
Billy, I'm only
in my second semester.

31:19.861 --> 31:21.620
Whatever, that's fine.
What do you think?

31:21.696 --> 31:23.438
Yeah, this is a really
good deal for you.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.381
I mean, she's crazy.

31:24.458 --> 31:26.049
Yeah.

31:26.126 --> 31:28.886
So anyway,
I was thinking of names.

31:28.962 --> 31:30.203
And what do you think
about, like, Bartini's?

31:30.280 --> 31:32.447
- [laughs]
- Barcelona?

31:32.449 --> 31:33.557
Billy's Bar?

31:33.634 --> 31:34.799
Sure. Whatever you want.

31:34.876 --> 31:36.301
Let's sleep.

31:36.378 --> 31:38.228
Bar and Away.

31:38.305 --> 31:39.804
Bar-B-Cue's good too.

31:39.881 --> 31:41.456
Billy's Bar.

31:41.458 --> 31:42.474
Nice ring.

31:52.302 --> 31:53.985
Listen, do you think we have
to be in here for this to work?

31:56.398 --> 31:58.248
Are you serious?
Where are we?

31:58.325 --> 32:00.066
Really?

32:00.144 --> 32:01.476
I'm not going anywhere
I might know anyone.

32:01.478 --> 32:04.404
Fine. They're going to think
we're having an affair.

32:04.481 --> 32:07.073
Only if we behave
like we are.

32:07.151 --> 32:08.425
How do you behave
like you're having an affair?

32:08.502 --> 32:09.927
- I don't know. I never had one.
- Me neither.

32:10.003 --> 32:13.246
Please. Let's just pretend
like we're an ordinary couple.

32:13.323 --> 32:15.173
Well, you did book it
for today, right?

32:15.250 --> 32:16.749
Yeah, could have sworn
I did, honey.

32:16.827 --> 32:18.326
Well, that wouldn't be the first
time you screwed that up.

32:18.328 --> 32:20.086
I'm sorry, dear.

32:20.164 --> 32:21.939
Let me get your name.

32:22.015 --> 32:24.349
Sure, it's Mr. and Mrs.
Wilp... son.

32:26.170 --> 32:27.519
Wilpson?

32:27.595 --> 32:29.762
Yes. Wilpson.
You got it.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.675
W-I-L-P-S-O-N.

32:33.677 --> 32:35.026
- [typing]
- Wilpson.

32:37.347 --> 32:39.347
[computer beeps]

32:39.349 --> 32:41.441
I'm afraid I can't find it.

32:41.518 --> 32:43.794
- I...
- Well, what a surprise.

32:43.870 --> 32:46.371
That is so strange.

32:46.448 --> 32:47.965
Do you have any rooms available
for tonight?

32:48.041 --> 32:50.875
Yes. King?

32:50.952 --> 32:51.951
Actually, do you have
two twins?

32:52.029 --> 32:53.619
Sorry, he snores.

32:53.697 --> 32:54.454
- I don't snore.
- Hmm, and lies.

32:54.531 --> 32:55.973
I...

32:56.049 --> 32:56.974
Sorry, only kings left.

32:57.050 --> 32:58.533
Okay.

32:58.535 --> 32:59.959
Room 532.

33:00.037 --> 33:01.294
Thank you very much.

33:01.371 --> 33:02.595
Oh, Billy.

33:05.726 --> 33:06.984
Sorry, dear.

33:07.060 --> 33:10.545
Treat them mean, keep them keen.
Know what I mean?

33:10.547 --> 33:11.655
Exactly.

33:14.901 --> 33:16.234
Well, that came
quite naturally to you.

33:16.311 --> 33:19.904
Made it much easier being
with you, Mr. "Wilpson"?

33:19.981 --> 33:20.813
Is that it?

33:20.891 --> 33:22.157
[door closes]

33:24.911 --> 33:27.245
Okay.

33:27.322 --> 33:28.580
I mean, who needs
that many cushions?

33:28.656 --> 33:31.583
They're not cushions.
They're called throw pillows.

33:31.659 --> 33:32.342
And, honestly, you can never
have too many.

33:34.071 --> 33:36.680
Oh! Do you want a beer?

33:36.757 --> 33:38.664
Do you know how expensive
mini bars are?

33:38.742 --> 33:40.008
Yeah. But I'm not paying.

33:42.003 --> 33:43.178
[bottle hisses open]

33:49.436 --> 33:50.977
[sighs]

34:01.431 --> 34:04.374
So, what are we thinking?
We thinking lights on? Off?

34:04.451 --> 34:05.825
- On.
- On.

34:08.121 --> 34:08.995
- [snaps fingers]
- That was a test. You passed.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.040
That's perfect.

34:15.795 --> 34:16.878
[sighs]

34:22.119 --> 34:23.301
Jeez.

34:23.378 --> 34:25.286
Sorry, sorry.

34:25.289 --> 34:26.554
So aggressive.

[snores]

34:34.130 --> 34:35.797
No. Mm-mm.

34:35.799 --> 34:36.898
I thought I was
a snorer.

34:57.337 --> 34:58.503
- Yes!
- Aah!

34:58.580 --> 35:00.764
- Sorry.
- Jeez!

35:00.841 --> 35:03.174
- Psycho. What is that about?
- I'm sorry.

35:03.251 --> 35:04.601
I told you not to wake me up
like that again.

35:06.346 --> 35:07.329
We slept.

35:07.331 --> 35:08.939
[sighs]

35:09.015 --> 35:11.257
Yes.

35:11.335 --> 35:13.001
All right, I got to go.
I got to go.

35:13.003 --> 35:15.019
You go to--

35:15.096 --> 35:16.613
Are we going to order
some breakfast?

35:16.690 --> 35:17.772
Don't even think about it.

35:19.676 --> 35:20.951
[playing jazzy music]

35:23.363 --> 35:25.438
What do you think?

35:25.515 --> 35:27.273
- I like it.
- Me too.

35:27.351 --> 35:28.032
Okay, let's try another one.

35:30.278 --> 35:31.795
Sign that lease, baby.

35:31.872 --> 35:33.855
[laughs]
Here's the keys!

35:33.857 --> 35:35.690
Yes. Let's do this.

35:35.692 --> 35:36.782
- One more!
- What?

35:36.860 --> 35:37.876
[laughs]

35:40.697 --> 35:41.546
Thank you.

35:49.706 --> 35:50.221
- [yelps]
- [laughs]

35:53.801 --> 35:55.318
And has your father decided
whether he's coming or not?

35:55.395 --> 35:58.971
His last e-mail said he would,
but you know him.

35:59.049 --> 36:01.316

but I do.

Hey, Billy, so I'm in charge
of this huge Christmas...

36:39.681 --> 36:41.256
party tonight,
and I was wondering

36:41.258 --> 36:45.109
if we could get together in the
afternoon for, like, a quickie?

36:45.186 --> 36:46.277
At yours.

36:46.354 --> 36:48.020
Um...

36:48.098 --> 36:49.689
uh, yeah.

36:49.766 --> 36:52.375
Yeah, I can do that.

36:52.452 --> 36:53.710
Where did you
get this thing?

- I saw someone throwing it away.
- Oh, I wonder why.

a good Christmas tree?

it could be cool.

Really cool.

this time.

37:34.811 --> 37:37.479
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

37:37.481 --> 37:38.830
- Oh!
- Come here.

37:38.906 --> 37:40.415
I'm going to catch you.

- Who, Viv?

- No, she likes girls.
- Not Vivian. Lizzie.

37:48.658 --> 37:50.825
Oh. No. She likes sleep.

37:50.827 --> 37:51.843
Do you like her?

37:51.919 --> 37:53.419
No.

37:53.497 --> 37:54.662
Is she attractive?

37:54.664 --> 37:56.756
I mean, yeah.

37:56.833 --> 37:59.276
- Then why don't you like her?
- Because she's engaged, Andy.

37:59.352 --> 38:01.686
That doesn't answer
the question.

38:01.763 --> 38:03.338

- I can't!

38:12.682 --> 38:14.032
Okay, so maybe
it happened again.

38:14.108 --> 38:16.960
- Well, there you go.
- I looked it up on the Internet.

38:17.037 --> 38:18.353
That only happens
from rapid eye movement sleep.

38:18.355 --> 38:21.706
I'm only getting REM sleep
when I'm next to her.

38:21.783 --> 38:23.875
So you get a boner
because she gives you REM sleep?

38:23.951 --> 38:26.136
Yes. Exactly.

38:26.212 --> 38:27.695
Makes sense, right?

38:27.697 --> 38:28.471
Are you kidding me?

getting out of hand?

even more than you do.

in a pod.

38:49.719 --> 38:52.495
Exactly. And Billy is none
of those things.

38:52.572 --> 38:53.813
Okay.

38:53.890 --> 38:56.482
Well, I'm glad
you feel that way,

38:56.560 --> 38:57.834
because I've been there,
remember?

38:57.911 --> 39:01.654
Emily dumped my sorry ass
when we were engaged,

39:01.731 --> 39:03.006
and it was not pretty,
and I would just, like,

39:03.083 --> 39:04.156
hate for that
to happen to you.

39:04.234 --> 39:06.009
Krissie, I hear you.

39:06.086 --> 39:07.752
And I know this is
an odd situation.

39:07.829 --> 39:09.070
But not sleeping
is really bad.

39:09.072 --> 39:10.162
You know that, right?

39:10.240 --> 39:11.831
Yeah, I actually do know.
I looked it up.

39:11.908 --> 39:13.241

your immune system

39:13.243 --> 39:15.743

you'll have Alzheimer's.

It, like, doubles your risk
of cancer, which is insane.

39:18.415 --> 39:19.839
Exactly. See?
So there you go.

39:19.916 --> 39:22.433
I mean, all of that should
be way more concerning to you

39:22.510 --> 39:23.585
than what I'm doing
about it,

39:23.587 --> 39:25.103
which, by the way,
is working wonders.

39:25.179 --> 39:27.864
I mean, not only do I feel and
look a thousand times better,

39:27.941 --> 39:30.608
but you and I are crushing
these Christmas parties.

39:30.685 --> 39:33.111
Yeah, we are.
It's, like, really impressive.

39:33.187 --> 39:34.278
- Yeah!
- And your wedding planning

39:34.355 --> 39:36.039
- is back on track.
- Yes!

39:36.116 --> 39:37.523
And I haven't killed my future
mother-in-law yet.

39:37.601 --> 39:41.044
So you should be looking
for someone to sleep with too.

39:41.121 --> 39:42.770
Okay, okay, so when
is your next sleep sesh?

39:42.772 --> 39:44.381
Tomorrow morning.

39:44.457 --> 39:45.940
I need a quick one before
I choose wedding place settings.

39:45.942 --> 39:48.443
But he's being Santa at his
goddaughter's school play,

39:48.445 --> 39:50.369
so I'm just going to go there
and drag him out.

39:50.447 --> 39:53.890
So that means you're going
to be meeting his friends.

39:53.967 --> 39:56.134
I mean, I don't know.
It's...

39:56.210 --> 39:57.560
It's not a big deal, okay?

39:57.637 --> 39:59.720
It's not like I'm going to go
and hang out with them.

40:01.791 --> 40:02.473
[camera shutters click]

40:04.794 --> 40:05.551
I cannot believe
she made me dress like this.

40:05.629 --> 40:06.886
- You look awesome.
- Sorry.

40:06.963 --> 40:10.131
She can be very persuasive.
But you do look dope.

40:10.133 --> 40:14.244
Elf! Little Charlie here wants
us to take a picture together.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.303
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

40:15.305 --> 40:17.155
Sure.

40:17.231 --> 40:19.749
Sorry. I just didn't think
that we'd be here this long.

40:22.570 --> 40:23.903
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Thank you.

40:23.980 --> 40:25.663
Ooh, can I have
some pictures too?

40:25.740 --> 40:27.924
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:28.001 --> 40:29.759
Can you sit
on Uncle Billy's lap?

40:31.488 --> 40:33.337
Oh, I don't...

40:33.414 --> 40:35.339
- Please?
- How do you say no to that?

40:35.416 --> 40:36.174
She's going to go
very far.

40:36.250 --> 40:37.842
Anything you want, kid.

40:37.919 --> 40:40.011
Ho, ho, ho.

40:40.087 --> 40:43.347
So, Lizzie, Billy says
you're getting married.

40:43.424 --> 40:45.591
Yes, I am.
In two weeks, actually.

40:45.669 --> 40:47.835
Super stressful.

40:47.837 --> 40:49.779
I have so much to do,
as I'm sure you know.

40:49.856 --> 40:51.597
Oh, no, no. We don't know.
We're not married.

40:51.675 --> 40:52.523
Oh. That's cool.

40:52.600 --> 40:55.267
So weddings just
aren't your thing?

40:55.345 --> 40:56.619
No, we'd love a nice wedding,

40:56.696 --> 41:00.364
it's just Rosie surprised us
by coming along,

41:00.441 --> 41:01.699
then... well,
you know what they say.

41:01.776 --> 41:03.626
Man plans and God laughs.

41:03.703 --> 41:04.794
Never heard that before.

41:04.871 --> 41:07.522
And, luckily, you don't
need a certificate

41:07.524 --> 41:08.948
to have the S-E-X anymore,
right?

41:09.025 --> 41:10.374
- Right.
- Oh, no.

41:10.451 --> 41:10.875
What's the S-E-X?

41:13.029 --> 41:14.862
[laughs]
Baby...

41:14.864 --> 41:17.122
Nothing. I'm so sorry.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.051
Why do you need
a certificate for it, then?

41:20.127 --> 41:21.219
No, sweetheart, you don't.
That's the point.

41:21.295 --> 41:22.870
[Rosie] Billy, have you had
the S-E-X too?

41:22.872 --> 41:24.630
Lizzie? Lizzie.

41:24.708 --> 41:26.649
[Rosie]
Why not?

41:26.726 --> 41:29.393
Yeah, it is you.
Simon. Simon Mousley.

41:29.470 --> 41:31.379
I play golf with Josh.
I beat him. I'm that guy.

41:31.381 --> 41:33.490
He owes me money.

41:33.566 --> 41:36.976
Yeah. Oh, my God.
Simon, how could I...?

41:37.053 --> 41:38.569
- Hi.
- I love this outfit.

41:38.646 --> 41:40.238
Everything, top to bottom.

41:40.314 --> 41:41.664
Yeah, it's crazy.
It's so good, right?

41:41.741 --> 41:44.817
I know. What are you doing here?

41:44.894 --> 41:47.245
Oh, ugh,
my nephew goes here,

41:47.321 --> 41:49.580
and I just couldn't think
of an excuse to get out of it.

41:49.657 --> 41:51.174
So are these guys
your friends?

41:51.251 --> 41:54.068
Um...

41:54.070 --> 41:57.071
No, actually.
I'm just organizing the event.

41:57.073 --> 41:59.907
Yeah, I'm an event planner.

41:59.909 --> 42:01.743
So just doing
this charity thing.

42:01.745 --> 42:03.594
You know, like giving back
to the community.

42:03.671 --> 42:05.522
Actually, when I got here
it was a really big mess.

42:05.598 --> 42:07.749
I mean, they're very
disorganized.

42:07.751 --> 42:08.858
I mean, I know they're not
professionals, but really.

42:08.935 --> 42:10.418
It's no excuse.

42:10.420 --> 42:11.694
- Just here, just helping out.
- Good for you.

42:11.771 --> 42:14.513
And I just can't wait to tell
Josh I ran into you--

42:14.591 --> 42:17.200
No! No, no, no.
Don't tell Josh, please,

42:17.277 --> 42:18.535
because it's actually a secret.

42:18.611 --> 42:20.611
He thinks I'm doing
way too much for free,

42:20.688 --> 42:22.688
and I promised him
that I would cut back.

42:22.766 --> 42:26.100
So let's just keep it between
you and me.

42:26.102 --> 42:28.119
- Locked. Thrown. Got it.
- Awesome. Great.

42:28.195 --> 42:29.437
Good to see you.
Merry Christmas.

42:29.439 --> 42:30.788
Merry Christmas.

42:30.865 --> 42:33.866
- See you at the wedding.
- You will see me at the wedding.

42:33.943 --> 42:34.959
- See you.
- Oh, my God. Bye.

42:42.619 --> 42:44.209
I'm sorry.

42:44.287 --> 42:46.062
No, it's all good.

42:46.139 --> 42:47.288
You know, we'll just go do
that sleeping thing.

42:47.290 --> 42:50.716
Us disorganized amateurs.

42:50.794 --> 42:52.018
They're real tired.

42:53.980 --> 42:55.405
Bye, friends.

42:55.481 --> 42:56.856
[Rosie]
Bye.

43:03.656 --> 43:06.082
You're not still mad at me,
are you?

43:06.159 --> 43:07.733
No, no.
Look, it's all good.

43:07.811 --> 43:10.235
But just so you know,

43:10.313 --> 43:11.754
not everyone loves planning
as much as you do.

43:11.831 --> 43:14.239
Some people like things
a little bit freer,

43:14.317 --> 43:15.983
where they can have this thing
called fun.

43:15.985 --> 43:17.985
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
I just--

43:17.987 --> 43:19.929
What I meant was,

43:20.006 --> 43:21.922
a little organization
can be a good thing.

43:23.676 --> 43:26.010
God!

43:26.087 --> 43:28.179
I just want this sleeping
problem to be over.

43:28.255 --> 43:30.440
Listen, you can't blame that
on being tired.

43:30.516 --> 43:32.275
Yes, I can, because it affects
everything.

43:32.352 --> 43:36.428
I guess it just doesn't
bother you as much.

43:36.506 --> 43:37.947
Just because I handle things
differently

43:38.024 --> 43:38.856
doesn't mean I'm not
bothered by it.

43:38.933 --> 43:40.450
Okay, well, go on, then.

43:40.526 --> 43:41.934
Why aren't you
trying everything

43:42.011 --> 43:43.861
to figure out
why you can't sleep?

43:43.938 --> 43:45.437
- I know why I can't sleep
- Okay.

43:45.515 --> 43:46.848
Do you want to tell me?

43:46.850 --> 43:48.032
- No, it's stupid.
- Come on, Billy.

43:51.037 --> 43:51.952
Okay, sure, yeah.

43:56.542 --> 43:58.283
I'm 13 years old.
I go to bed one night.

43:58.361 --> 43:59.802
Just a normal night.

43:59.879 --> 44:02.363
And I wake up in the morning,

44:02.365 --> 44:04.790
and I see my mom crying

44:04.868 --> 44:07.218
because my dad
had disappeared.

44:07.294 --> 44:09.595
Like, totally gone.

44:12.225 --> 44:16.135
Turns out he had another girl
that he decided to live with.

44:16.212 --> 44:18.562
He did call me months later,
months later,

44:18.639 --> 44:20.548
to try and apologize,

44:20.550 --> 44:21.382
but I'm not going
to talk to him again.

44:21.384 --> 44:22.325
So...

44:27.481 --> 44:29.407
that's why I can't sleep.

44:29.483 --> 44:31.000
Because who knows what might
happen when I do.

44:32.745 --> 44:33.953
Boy, that...

44:36.157 --> 44:37.899
I'm so sorry.

44:37.901 --> 44:38.958
Yeah, well,
I told you it was stupid, so...

44:40.403 --> 44:41.252
good night.

44:46.759 --> 44:48.743
[Billy sighs]

44:48.745 --> 44:49.593
I don't think
it's stupid at all.

44:52.506 --> 44:54.682
For what it's worth,
I get it.

44:57.253 --> 44:58.310
My dad was never
really there for me either.

45:01.941 --> 45:03.515
Yeah, he's a pilot.

45:03.593 --> 45:06.369
Great at being up in the air,

45:06.446 --> 45:10.281
but not so good
at being on the ground.

45:10.357 --> 45:14.210
I thought that I would
see a lot more of him

45:14.287 --> 45:15.269
after my mom died,

45:15.271 --> 45:18.122
but, no.

45:18.199 --> 45:21.884
I mean, he always makes these
big promises to come visit me,

45:21.961 --> 45:24.036
but...

45:24.113 --> 45:26.222
anyway...

45:26.299 --> 45:28.282
I guess that's why
I like making plans

45:28.284 --> 45:30.226
and sticking to them.

45:33.456 --> 45:34.305
Yeah, it's odd.

45:39.312 --> 45:40.811
Good night.

45:42.298 --> 45:42.855
Good night.

is my favorite.

46:09.492 --> 46:10.582
You don't like it?

46:10.660 --> 46:12.101
Hmm?

46:12.178 --> 46:13.752
Oh, yeah.

46:13.830 --> 46:15.179
No, they're...
they're lovely.

46:19.018 --> 46:20.610
Are you feeling
a bit tired again?

46:20.686 --> 46:23.020
No, no, no. I'm fine.

46:23.097 --> 46:26.765
Just looking at all of this,
and...

46:26.843 --> 46:27.950
And?

Thinking how wonderful
it all is.

It is wonderful,
isn't it?

You know, when Mr. Wright and I
got married,

46:40.023 --> 46:41.539
we couldn't afford
all of this.

46:41.615 --> 46:42.857
We had paper plates.

50:04.393 --> 50:06.560
Well, hello.

50:06.562 --> 50:08.671
I-- I didn't think
you'd want to see me.

50:08.748 --> 50:11.915
Are you kidding? I'm delighted.
Didn't think you'd slum it here.

50:11.992 --> 50:12.916
What? I always love
to party on--

50:12.993 --> 50:14.585
Wait, where the hell
are we again?

50:14.661 --> 50:16.754
[laughs]

50:16.830 --> 50:18.497
No, I'm joking, I'm joking.

50:18.574 --> 50:20.074
Seriously, this place is--
I mean, it's legit.

50:20.076 --> 50:23.352
Well, you might make some money
on your investment after all.

50:23.429 --> 50:24.928
No, I still have faith in you
to screw it up.

50:25.005 --> 50:26.838
Fair. That's fair.

50:26.916 --> 50:28.357
I just--
I got to give it to you, okay?

50:28.434 --> 50:32.086
I really need your addresses,

50:32.088 --> 50:33.362
because I want to invite you all
to the wedding.

50:33.439 --> 50:36.440
- And Rosie too.
- Wow, thank you. We'd love to.

50:36.517 --> 50:37.516
- Yeah?
- All right. Yeah, yeah.

50:37.593 --> 50:39.851
- Nice.
- So, bachelorette,

50:39.929 --> 50:40.703
you going to sing us
a song?

50:40.780 --> 50:42.187
Song? No, no, no.

50:42.265 --> 50:44.782
Yes!

50:44.858 --> 50:45.766
That's a great idea.
Are you kidding me?

50:45.768 --> 50:47.451
- No.
- [Billy] Oh, I'm sorry,

50:47.528 --> 50:49.787
did you not plan to sing,
so I guess you can't?

50:49.863 --> 50:52.697
Suzanne, we ready to rock?

50:52.775 --> 50:54.958
- Yes! You're doing it.
- No! Billy!

50:55.035 --> 50:56.460
Think of it as
my wedding gift to you.

50:56.537 --> 50:59.613
- Don't leave me up here alone.
- I'm not. I'll stay here.

50:59.615 --> 51:01.390
Oh, it's perfect.
You know this one?

51:01.467 --> 51:03.467
I actually do this song.
You know this song?

51:03.544 --> 51:04.709
Yeah, but I'm not a singer.

But Vivian needs you
by the bar.

52:59.402 --> 53:00.843
- Oh, uh...
- Yeah, of course. Go, go, go.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.011
Yeah, I'll just-- Sorry.

53:05.074 --> 53:07.424
Oh, Lizzie, this is Nic.

53:07.501 --> 53:09.018
Nicola, this is Lizzie.

53:09.094 --> 53:11.520
- Hey. It's nice to meet you.
- Hi. You too.

53:11.597 --> 53:12.763
I've heard all about you.

53:12.839 --> 53:14.506
Great.

53:14.583 --> 53:16.750
Um...

53:16.752 --> 53:18.752
I'm sorry about...

53:18.754 --> 53:21.422
I'll see if I can find you
some penis-shaped ice cubes

53:21.424 --> 53:23.257
or something.

53:23.259 --> 53:25.442
Your bachelorette.

53:25.519 --> 53:27.594
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

53:27.596 --> 53:29.029
Please, that'd be great.

53:34.937 --> 53:36.361
- [laughs]
- A shot for the rock star.

53:36.439 --> 53:38.038
Okay.

53:39.866 --> 53:41.458
Let's do this.

53:41.535 --> 53:42.709
[all]
Cheers.

53:44.780 --> 53:45.554
[Kristina]
Oh, wow, girl.

53:45.631 --> 53:47.205
[laughter]

53:47.283 --> 53:49.132
So good.

53:49.209 --> 53:51.452
I'm getting married,
so let's have another.

[toilet flushes]

53:57.884 --> 53:59.401
[sighs]

54:04.967 --> 54:06.817
I'm sorry.
It was my bachelorette party.

54:06.893 --> 54:09.245
But people get drunk
on their bachelorette parties.

54:09.321 --> 54:10.895
You got drunk
on your bachelor night.

54:10.973 --> 54:12.990
Not that drunk.

54:13.066 --> 54:14.750
Not my problem you don't like
to lose control.

54:14.827 --> 54:15.742
What is that
supposed to mean?

54:17.329 --> 54:19.088
I'm sorry.

54:19.164 --> 54:20.756
I'm just... I'm just tired.

54:20.833 --> 54:21.757
Okay?

54:24.745 --> 54:25.928
[sighs]

54:32.661 --> 54:34.103
Sorry I'm late.
We're off to a great start.

54:34.179 --> 54:36.830
Drinks are pouring out,
money's pouring in.

54:36.832 --> 54:37.922
Congratulations.
That sounds awesome.

54:38.000 --> 54:38.932
Yeah.

54:40.853 --> 54:45.114
So it was really nice
meeting your... new girlfriend?

54:45.190 --> 54:48.008
Ex, actually.
She dumped me.

54:48.010 --> 54:49.952
But we're giving it
another shot.

54:50.029 --> 54:51.770
Right.

54:51.847 --> 54:52.788
Well, I'm happy
for you.

54:52.865 --> 54:54.681
And me.

54:54.683 --> 54:57.034
I feel much better
about sleeping with you

54:57.110 --> 54:58.961
now that you're seeing
somebody else.

55:00.372 --> 55:01.955
Awesome.

55:05.878 --> 55:07.127
Thank you.

55:09.865 --> 55:10.973
Talk to me.
What'd you think of the bar?

55:11.050 --> 55:13.809
- Any feedback?
- Really. I thought it was good.

55:13.886 --> 55:15.126
I mean, once you iron out
the kinks,

55:15.204 --> 55:17.479
it's going to be great.

55:17.556 --> 55:19.148
Oh, yeah? What kinks?

55:19.224 --> 55:22.133
Well, I mean, the service
was a little bumpy.

55:22.211 --> 55:23.301
Music was all over the place.

55:23.379 --> 55:24.378
Champagne was kind of warm.

55:24.380 --> 55:25.729
No, no, that didn't seem
to stop you

55:25.806 --> 55:28.215
when you tried to get the entire
bar to do the Macarena.

55:28.217 --> 55:29.550
[laughs]
Relax.

55:29.552 --> 55:32.494
I mean, you asked.
I was just pointing things out.

55:32.571 --> 55:33.978
Yeah, well,
maybe I shouldn't have.

55:34.056 --> 55:35.572
- [cell phone vibrates]
- Glad you're a silent partner.

55:35.649 --> 55:37.574
Silent doesn't mean dumb.

55:37.651 --> 55:39.226
Hello?

55:39.228 --> 55:40.744
Hey, babe.

55:43.415 --> 55:46.175
At home? Yeah, of course.

55:46.251 --> 55:47.843
Why aren't you at work?

55:47.920 --> 55:49.011
[whispering]
Wait, he's at your house?

55:49.088 --> 55:50.662
Cycling.

55:50.739 --> 55:51.996
- Yeah, I...
- Who cycles?

55:52.074 --> 55:53.682
No, I can't hear you
ringing the doorbell.

55:53.759 --> 55:57.502
That's weird. Why don't you try
ringing that again.

55:57.580 --> 55:58.854
- [stammering]
- Still can't hear it ringing.

56:00.249 --> 56:02.507
[mouthing]

56:02.585 --> 56:03.842
I can't come down
right now, because I'm...

56:03.919 --> 56:06.362
- [whispering] Help me.
- [whispering] Just hang up.

56:06.438 --> 56:08.088
[both mouthing]

56:08.090 --> 56:10.440
Because I'm in the bath.

56:10.517 --> 56:11.182
- What?
- Yeah. Just soaking it up.

56:11.260 --> 56:12.859
Um...

56:15.355 --> 56:18.765
Yeah, no, you're
absolutely right.

56:18.767 --> 56:21.359
I'm in the Hotel Racine,
Room 532.

56:21.437 --> 56:22.694
No, no.

56:22.771 --> 56:24.454
Okay, bye.

56:24.531 --> 56:26.048
He's coming over.

56:26.125 --> 56:28.442
- He's...
- Stop. What are you doing?

56:28.444 --> 56:30.368
- What do you think I'm doing?
- You can't go, okay?

56:30.446 --> 56:32.888
He's not going to believe it
if it just comes from me.

56:32.965 --> 56:35.465
Oh, right, because he's going
to believe me.

56:35.542 --> 56:37.041
I don't know, maybe.
I mean, look, if you stay,

56:37.119 --> 56:39.210
it proves you've got
nothing to hide, okay?

56:39.288 --> 56:40.637
It's so ridiculous,
he's got to believe us.

56:40.714 --> 56:41.880
- Does he got a gun?
- No!

56:41.957 --> 56:43.974
- [sighs]
- Yes.

56:44.050 --> 56:45.292
But he only uses it
for skeet shooting.

56:45.294 --> 56:48.145
Oh, skeet shooting.
I'm fine, then.

56:48.221 --> 56:49.312
- I'm out of here.
- Oh, my God, stop. Don't go.

56:49.389 --> 56:50.797
Oh, my God,
what if he shoots me?

56:50.799 --> 56:53.467
Frankly, you deserve it,
if only for answering the phone.

56:53.469 --> 56:55.560
- Josh!
- Aah! How the hell?

56:55.638 --> 56:56.319
I don't know, dude.
Maybe I got suspicious

56:56.396 --> 56:57.487
and used Find my Phone.

56:57.564 --> 57:00.474
No, Josh, just stop.
Let me explain, okay?

57:00.476 --> 57:01.642
- It's not what you think.
- Of course it's not.

57:01.644 --> 57:03.735
Men and women meet secretly
in hotel rooms

57:03.812 --> 57:05.495
for all sorts of things.

57:05.572 --> 57:07.147
I just can't think
of any offhand.

57:07.149 --> 57:09.258
Oh, yeah, here's one:
banging each other senseless.

57:09.334 --> 57:10.575
That is quite popular.

57:10.653 --> 57:12.669
No, no. Okay, look.

57:12.746 --> 57:14.930
Billy makes me sleep.

57:15.007 --> 57:16.490
- What?
- It's true. It's true.

57:16.492 --> 57:19.268
I can't sleep either, and then
one night I went for a run

57:19.344 --> 57:22.086
- and she ran me over--
- No, he ran in front of me

57:22.164 --> 57:23.497
and I hit him,
so I drove us to the hospital.

57:23.499 --> 57:25.515
- That's what happened.
- She ran me over, and then--

57:25.592 --> 57:28.685
Anyway, that's when we found out
when we're next to each other,

57:28.762 --> 57:30.187
- we can sleep.
- Yes, exactly.

57:30.263 --> 57:32.172
Which is all we do, okay?

57:32.174 --> 57:33.607
We get together
and we sleep.

57:37.846 --> 57:39.621
Are you being serious
right now?

57:39.698 --> 57:41.198
- You expect me to believe this?
- [both] Yes!

57:41.274 --> 57:44.275
Oh, if you shout it together
like that in unison, of course.

57:44.353 --> 57:45.777
No, it's true, Josh.

57:45.854 --> 57:48.538
Okay, look, I know I should
have told you, I know that.

57:48.615 --> 57:50.114
But I didn't want you
to worry.

57:50.192 --> 57:52.134
I didn't want you to think that
anything was wrong. It's not.

57:52.211 --> 57:56.530
Okay? I was just so desperate
to get some sleep

57:56.532 --> 57:58.307
so that I could wake up each day
and stay focused

57:58.383 --> 58:01.718
on organizing us
an amazing wedding.

58:01.795 --> 58:02.978
Oh, I see, so you were
doing it for us.

58:03.055 --> 58:04.796
Yes, exactly.

58:04.873 --> 58:06.297
I mean, I know
that sounds crazy,

58:06.375 --> 58:09.651
but you can't really believe
that I would want to be here.

58:09.728 --> 58:11.228
Right? With that guy.
Come on.

58:11.304 --> 58:14.656
[Billy]
Yeah, and I can assure you

58:14.733 --> 58:15.732
that I'm not at all
interested in her.

58:17.886 --> 58:19.402
That's not to say
that I can't see

58:19.479 --> 58:22.146
why she would
be attractive to you.

58:22.224 --> 58:23.165
She just doesn't do it for me,
you know.

58:23.242 --> 58:25.058
She's not my type.

58:25.060 --> 58:27.503
Because I'm not some ditzy
aerobics instructor.

58:27.579 --> 58:28.670
It's Zumba, and I'm not into
control freaks

58:28.747 --> 58:30.321
who lose their mind
when a plan changes.

58:30.399 --> 58:33.157
Yeah, I'm not into lazy slobs
who still think farting's funny.

58:33.235 --> 58:35.660
Farting is funny. Who doesn't
think farting is funny?

58:35.738 --> 58:36.169
Okay, okay, that's enough.

58:38.407 --> 58:39.848
I'm not saying
I believe you.

58:39.925 --> 58:43.410
But go on, then.
Prove it.

58:43.412 --> 58:45.579
Prove what?

58:45.581 --> 58:48.098
Prove that even though you say
you don't like each other,

58:48.174 --> 58:49.750
that you make each other sleep.

58:49.752 --> 58:51.418
- Okay, fine. We will.
- Great. Go on. then.

58:51.420 --> 58:52.252
You good?

58:52.254 --> 58:54.512
Sure.

58:54.590 --> 58:56.089
Okay, I have a question, though.

58:56.091 --> 58:59.593
How are you going to know we're
not pretending to be asleep?

58:59.595 --> 59:01.111
- Lizzie--
- I just want to know the plan.

59:01.187 --> 59:02.687
That's a good point.

59:02.765 --> 59:03.780
Because...

59:07.436 --> 59:08.544
I am going to take you both
back to my friend

59:08.620 --> 59:11.438
at the sleep clinic
and have you monitored.

59:11.440 --> 59:12.697
That's a great idea.

59:12.775 --> 59:15.275
Wait, what the hell's
a sleep clinic?

59:15.277 --> 59:16.626
What the hell's
a sleep clinic?

59:16.703 --> 59:20.447
It's actually very legit,
and you're coming with us.

59:20.449 --> 59:22.040
- No, I'm not going.
- Yeah, you are.

59:22.117 --> 59:23.392
- No, I'm not.
- Actually, you're coming.

59:23.468 --> 59:26.228
Okay, listen, you guys expect me
to take the night off

59:26.305 --> 59:27.971
from my new bar
at Christmastime

59:28.048 --> 59:29.122
so we can go to a clinic

59:29.124 --> 59:31.124
to prove that we make each other
sleep?

59:31.126 --> 59:33.143
- Yes!
- Yes!

59:33.219 --> 59:34.903
When you shout it
together like that, then...

59:39.468 --> 59:40.066
I'll make some calls.

I'm sorry for all of this.

01:00:02.658 --> 01:00:03.915
It's fine.

01:00:03.992 --> 01:00:05.992
Jeez, you never told me
he looked like that. Wow.

What is he,
a Chippendale?

01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:12.107
If I were any dumber,
I'd think you're jealous

01:00:12.184 --> 01:00:13.942
that I'm getting back together
with Nicola.

01:00:14.019 --> 01:00:15.277
Trust me, you couldn't be
any dumber.

(Scoffing)

01:00:16.855 --> 01:00:18.188
Okay, all done.

01:00:18.264 --> 01:00:22.342
I've never tested two people
at the same time before.

What if we can't sleep?

Then Josh will conclude that
we've been screwing each other.

01:00:40.286 --> 01:00:41.862
My life is over.

01:00:41.864 --> 01:00:43.530

- I'll take this, yeah.

01:08:53.354 --> 01:08:54.629
Okay.

01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:59.134
Hey, just one more thing.

01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:03.363
I was thinking about your dad
leaving,

01:09:03.365 --> 01:09:05.788
and that wasn't your fault.

01:09:05.867 --> 01:09:06.474
You know that, right?

01:09:08.036 --> 01:09:10.310
Yeah.

01:09:10.388 --> 01:09:12.630
No. Really.
It wasn't, Billy.

01:09:12.707 --> 01:09:15.707
He may have screwed up,
but you're not like him.

01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:16.309
You're an amazing guy.

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:18.987
And, unlike him...

01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:22.991
I bet you'd be
an incredible dad.

01:09:28.481 --> 01:09:30.055
Uh, yeah, I'm going to get
back to work.

01:09:30.058 --> 01:09:30.823
Yeah.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.339
All right.
Take care of that pillow.

01:09:38.416 --> 01:09:40.082
Don't drool on that.

01:09:40.158 --> 01:09:41.325
You dick.

01:09:41.403 --> 01:09:42.001
[laughs]

01:09:44.087 --> 01:09:45.345
Bye.

01:09:45.423 --> 01:09:49.242
[door opens and closes]

01:09:49.243 --> 01:09:51.019
[sighs]

01:09:51.095 --> 01:09:52.578
Billy.

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.580
Oh! Whoopsie.

01:09:54.582 --> 01:09:56.432
- Who's next?
- Billy!

01:09:56.509 --> 01:09:59.194
Come on, who wants some shots?
It's New Year's Eve tomorrow.

01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:01.029
You want one? Yeah, I do!

01:10:01.105 --> 01:10:01.938
- Whoo!
- [glass shatters]

01:10:03.758 --> 01:10:05.182
Okay, I can do that better.

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.442
Watch this.

01:10:06.519 --> 01:10:07.777
Whoo!

01:10:09.188 --> 01:10:10.872
Andy?

01:10:10.949 --> 01:10:12.040
We need help.

01:10:19.699 --> 01:10:21.774
Oh.

01:10:21.776 --> 01:10:22.884
Those go on the upstairs
balcony.

01:10:30.952 --> 01:10:32.009
Lizzie.

01:10:34.622 --> 01:10:36.714
Here.

01:10:36.791 --> 01:10:38.566
Okay, let's go over
the plan, shall we?

01:10:38.643 --> 01:10:40.643
Shower now.
Hair starts at 10:00.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.627
Makeup at 11:00.
Dress on at 12:00.

01:10:41.629 --> 01:10:42.853
And pictures at 12:30.

01:10:44.299 --> 01:10:45.481
[sighs]

01:10:45.558 --> 01:10:46.816
Sounds good.

01:10:46.892 --> 01:10:48.301
We're doing it.

01:10:48.303 --> 01:10:50.152
Let's do it.

01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:51.362
[groans]

01:11:26.007 --> 01:11:27.840
Whoa. What are you doing?

01:11:27.842 --> 01:11:30.176
Hey, where'd you come from?

01:11:30.178 --> 01:11:33.771
I slept on the floor after
we carried you home last night.

01:11:33.848 --> 01:11:35.515
Thought I'd keep Andy company

01:11:35.517 --> 01:11:36.516
in case you try to fight
anyone again.

01:11:36.518 --> 01:11:38.293
Oh.

01:11:38.369 --> 01:11:39.943
What are you doing?

01:11:40.021 --> 01:11:41.537
I'm cleaning up my act.

01:11:41.614 --> 01:11:43.781
- [laughs]
- Right.

01:11:43.858 --> 01:11:45.967
Very literal.

01:11:46.044 --> 01:11:47.451
Are you sure you need
to pour it all away?

01:11:47.529 --> 01:11:49.304
No. Good point.

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:50.921
Here, take it.

01:11:53.217 --> 01:11:53.975
Thank you.

01:11:54.052 --> 01:11:55.459
I'm sorry.

01:11:55.537 --> 01:11:59.129
You trusted me, you left
your job, and I let you down.

01:11:59.207 --> 01:12:00.556
- I won't do it again.
- It's okay.

01:12:00.633 --> 01:12:02.141
That's what friends are for.

01:12:04.712 --> 01:12:06.487
Look, there's something
I need to do,

01:12:06.564 --> 01:12:08.731
so just take everything I got,

01:12:08.808 --> 01:12:10.140
especially the tequila
and the vodka.

01:12:10.218 --> 01:12:12.160
I heard that!

01:12:16.724 --> 01:12:17.990
[phone line ringing]

01:12:21.896 --> 01:12:23.245
Dad.

01:12:23.322 --> 01:12:25.122
Hey, it's Billy.

01:12:31.072 --> 01:12:32.463
I know, I know. It's...

01:12:35.334 --> 01:12:37.352
Yeah.

01:12:37.428 --> 01:12:39.261
It's nice to hear
your voice.

01:12:45.678 --> 01:12:47.103
Where's my princess?

01:12:48.756 --> 01:12:49.755
Dad?

01:12:49.757 --> 01:12:51.515
Lizzie?

01:12:51.593 --> 01:12:53.534
Oh!

01:12:53.611 --> 01:12:56.095
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm late.

01:12:56.097 --> 01:12:57.930
Look at you.

01:12:57.932 --> 01:13:00.875
Oh! Short story long:
a guy got sick in Dubai,

01:13:00.952 --> 01:13:02.025
I had to take his route
to Paris,

01:13:02.103 --> 01:13:04.270
I missed my connection
in Amsterdam.

01:13:04.272 --> 01:13:06.047
It's okay.
It's so good to see you.

01:13:06.124 --> 01:13:07.865
[sighs]

01:13:07.942 --> 01:13:09.275
Hey, babe,
are you showered yet?

01:13:09.277 --> 01:13:11.368
Yeah, I hit the hot spots.

01:13:11.446 --> 01:13:13.554
Knock, knock.

01:13:13.631 --> 01:13:16.057
- Uncle Billy!
- [Billy] Yay!

01:13:16.134 --> 01:13:18.208
Hey, are we going
to this wedding, or what?

01:13:18.286 --> 01:13:19.710
- Sure.
- Great. But first,

01:13:19.787 --> 01:13:22.379
Gemma, I'm sorry for being
grumpy on Christmas Day.

01:13:22.457 --> 01:13:23.806
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

01:13:23.883 --> 01:13:27.551
Rosie, I'm sorry for being
grumpy on Christmas Day.

01:13:27.629 --> 01:13:28.961
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

01:13:28.963 --> 01:13:30.238
You can bring
your baseball game.

01:13:30.314 --> 01:13:31.555
We'll play it in the car.
All right?

01:13:31.633 --> 01:13:32.523
Andy...

01:13:34.802 --> 01:13:35.901
thanks for being
such a good friend.

01:13:37.655 --> 01:13:38.821
It's all good.

01:13:38.898 --> 01:13:41.824
Great. Now, do you have
a suit I can borrow?

01:13:41.901 --> 01:13:44.477
I knew it.
I knew that's what--

01:13:44.479 --> 01:13:45.870
You need something,
didn't you?

01:13:53.078 --> 01:13:54.670
[indistinct chatter]

01:14:04.207 --> 01:14:06.149
Wow.

01:14:06.225 --> 01:14:07.892
Oh, man. That's nice.

01:14:10.971 --> 01:14:13.214
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:15.474
I just think my hangover
is finally kicking in.

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:17.809
Hey.

01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:19.311
Are you the guys from the...

01:14:19.389 --> 01:14:19.887
Lizzie's friends.

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:22.723
It's you guys.

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:23.908
- Is that Santa?
- No. Wrong guy.

01:14:23.984 --> 01:14:25.668
You're Santa, aren't you?

01:14:25.745 --> 01:14:27.319
- No.
- Santa would do that.

01:14:27.397 --> 01:14:28.171
It is you.

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:32.066
Santa!

01:14:32.068 --> 01:14:33.584
I am so sorry.

01:14:33.661 --> 01:14:35.069
I completely forgot.

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:37.013
Do not tell Josh.

01:14:37.089 --> 01:14:37.796
My man.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:48.507
I can't do this.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

01:14:48.585 --> 01:14:50.100
- You stay. I got to go.
- Where are you going?

01:14:50.177 --> 01:14:52.177
- Got to go home.
- [Andy grunts]

01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:54.146
Are you crazy?
That's so far.

01:14:58.261 --> 01:14:59.202
[Lizzie's dad]
So the turbulence gets worse,

01:14:59.278 --> 01:15:00.536
and the passengers
are freaking out.

01:15:00.613 --> 01:15:02.763
I mean, screaming, crying,
throwing up. I think,

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:05.875
"I got to calm them down.
I know, I'll tell them a joke."

01:15:05.952 --> 01:15:07.359
So I get on the intercom
and I go,

01:15:07.437 --> 01:15:10.213
"Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

01:15:10.289 --> 01:15:12.623
"A man goes to a zoo.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:15.610
The zoo is so bad that it only
has one dog."

01:15:15.612 --> 01:15:17.553
Know what kind it was?

01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:19.555
Lizzie?

01:15:19.632 --> 01:15:20.798
What kind do you
think it was?

01:15:22.285 --> 01:15:23.375
What what was?

01:15:23.453 --> 01:15:25.377
The dog.

01:15:25.455 --> 01:15:27.221
What dog?

01:15:29.049 --> 01:15:31.976
Oh, we're here.

01:15:32.052 --> 01:15:33.236
Let's get you hitched.

01:15:33.312 --> 01:15:34.061
Okay.

01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:36.405
[exhales]

01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:40.317
[bells tolling]

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:47.733
[car door closes]

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.477
Lizzie, you look wonderful.

01:15:49.479 --> 01:15:50.586
You ready for this?

01:15:57.670 --> 01:15:59.595
Excellent.
Okay, let's go.

01:16:01.824 --> 01:16:03.424
["Bridal Chorus" playing]

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:49.203
Now before we begin,
it is my obligation

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:52.540
to ask if there's anyone present
who knows of any legal reason

01:16:52.542 --> 01:16:55.934
why these two should not be wed
in holy matrimony?

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:02.316
Okay, let's begin.

01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:06.220
Joshua George Wright,

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:09.981
do you give yourself to
Elizabeth Jasmine Skye Hinnell

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:11.392
to be her husband,

01:17:11.394 --> 01:17:13.318
to love her, care for her,

01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:16.731
honor and protect her
as long as you both shall live?

01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:17.748
I do.

01:17:19.585 --> 01:17:22.086
Elizabeth Jasmine
Skye Hinnell,

01:17:22.162 --> 01:17:24.680
do you give yourself
to Joshua George Wright,

01:17:24.757 --> 01:17:27.074
- to be his wife...
- [camera clicks]

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:28.759
...to love him, care for him,

01:17:28.836 --> 01:17:30.411
honor and protect him

01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:31.595
as long as you both
shall live?

01:17:46.946 --> 01:17:48.529
Uh, Lizzie?

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.282
Lizzie?

01:17:52.359 --> 01:17:53.826
[whispering]
Lizzie?

01:17:55.195 --> 01:17:55.869
Lizzie?

01:17:57.607 --> 01:17:59.865
Lizzie? Lizzie?

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:00.883
[gasps]

01:18:03.036 --> 01:18:04.553
Oh, wow, did I just...?

01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:06.055
[clears throat]

01:18:06.132 --> 01:18:07.281
Yeah, I did.

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:08.707
Uh...

01:18:08.785 --> 01:18:11.894
sorry, I just haven't
been sleeping well.

01:18:11.971 --> 01:18:13.804
Overexcited, I guess.
Please, continue.

01:18:13.881 --> 01:18:16.473
[laughs]

01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:18.793
Elizabeth Jasmine
Skye Hinnell,

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:20.978
- do you give yourself to-- ?
- Hold on.

01:18:21.054 --> 01:18:23.388
What do you mean
you haven't been sleeping well?

01:18:23.466 --> 01:18:24.573
I thought you've been
sleeping fine.

01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:25.741
You said it was velvety.

01:18:25.818 --> 01:18:27.893
Josh, please, not now.

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:29.153
Not now?

01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:31.572
You just nodded off
in the middle of our vows.

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:36.401
Lizzie, have you been
faking it?

01:18:36.479 --> 01:18:39.371
No! No.

01:18:41.241 --> 01:18:41.874
Well, maybe.

01:18:44.077 --> 01:18:45.094
[sighs]

01:18:45.171 --> 01:18:46.912
Yes.

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:48.764
- Mm.
- I'm so sorry, Josh.

01:18:48.841 --> 01:18:49.598
I really...

01:18:49.675 --> 01:18:51.508
[sighs]

01:18:51.585 --> 01:18:52.593
...I wanted to tell you.

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:55.938
Oh, God, I should
have told you.

01:18:56.015 --> 01:18:59.257
Okay, and what else
haven't you been telling me?

01:18:59.335 --> 01:19:00.851
I mean, this may not be
the right time to ask this,

01:19:00.928 --> 01:19:03.687
or maybe this is exactly
the right time to ask this.

01:19:06.099 --> 01:19:08.284
Do you love me?

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.177
Do you really love me
and want to marry me?

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:12.863
Josh, honey,
that's enough.

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.198
No, Mom.

01:19:14.274 --> 01:19:16.292
This isn't just about today.

01:19:16.368 --> 01:19:17.367
This is about the rest
of our lives.

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.298
Lizzie, I love you more than
anything in the world,

01:19:22.374 --> 01:19:23.858
and I want to be with you
forever.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:27.953
But if you're not sure
about wanting to be with me,

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:29.463
then I think I deserve
to know the truth.

01:19:33.369 --> 01:19:34.643
It's okay.

01:19:36.222 --> 01:19:37.429
I...

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:41.058
I don't know, Josh.

01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:48.649
I really thought I did.

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:54.071
But then this whole sleeping
thing happened, and...

01:19:58.728 --> 01:19:59.952
I guess the honest answer is,
no.

01:20:02.732 --> 01:20:03.339
[Lizzie]
I'm so sorry.

01:20:03.415 --> 01:20:05.674
This is not your fault.

01:20:05.751 --> 01:20:07.492
You did nothing wrong.
You're amazing.

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:09.737
You're so amazing.

01:20:09.739 --> 01:20:10.846
[laughs]
Okay.

01:20:15.745 --> 01:20:17.520
This wasn't really
the plan, huh?

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:22.015
No. It really wasn't.

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:25.978
I'm sorry.

01:20:31.518 --> 01:20:32.851
Oh, hey, no, no, no.

01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:34.537
No, I-- Let me just--

01:20:34.613 --> 01:20:37.522
- It's okay.
- It's stuck.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.524
Yeah, I can't get it off.

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:41.118
You'll give it to me later.

01:20:41.194 --> 01:20:42.545
I'm sorry.

01:20:48.127 --> 01:20:49.552
Krissy, you were right.

01:20:49.628 --> 01:20:51.036
However much it hurt,

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:53.948
it's so much better that Emily
called off the wedding

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:55.724
before you found out

01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:56.633
she wanted to do something else
with her life.

01:20:56.710 --> 01:20:59.286
Yeah.

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:00.788
Like have sex with men.

01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:02.398
What?

01:21:02.474 --> 01:21:04.716
Yeah, she's...

01:21:04.794 --> 01:21:06.902
dating some farmer
named Brian.

01:21:06.979 --> 01:21:09.980
Really? Wow, I did not
see that coming.

01:21:10.057 --> 01:21:11.389
I mean, are you sure?
Because I feel--

01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:13.242
I just feel like you're getting
a little distracted.

01:21:16.488 --> 01:21:17.805
You're right.

01:21:17.807 --> 01:21:19.748
Yeah.

01:21:19.825 --> 01:21:20.975
I'm so sorry
for the wasted trip, Dad.

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:22.585
Oh, honey.

01:21:22.661 --> 01:21:24.661
And the dog,
it was a shih tzu.

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:27.998
Yes, it was.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.878
Fiona, I'm sorry.

01:21:35.825 --> 01:21:37.215
I really wish
I'd left you in jail.

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:42.179
Yeah...

01:21:45.668 --> 01:21:47.109
I'm sorry.

01:21:47.186 --> 01:21:48.936
It's okay.

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:00.122
Home, I think.

01:22:00.199 --> 01:22:02.124
