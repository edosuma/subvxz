SENTINEL ( beeping ): Warning. Sentinel shield has been damaged.

01:05.744 --> 01:09.111
One more direct hit, and we could be the grand finale.

01:09.211 --> 01:12.611
Yes. Better stow the spare weapons and ammo in the hold.

01:12.711 --> 01:15.078
Underneath the armored flooring.

Moderate. Waspinator in pain, but still functional.

01:40.616 --> 01:44.150
Not you, imbecile. The computer!

Megatron! Electrical fire on the lower deck!

02:00.052 --> 02:02.919
This is your roving robot reporter.

02:03.019 --> 02:06.353
Eh, you want the bad news or the worse news?

02:08.720 --> 02:12.488
Oh, what is this? Program will not respond!

02:12.588 --> 02:16.255
Waspinator does not understand.

02:18.522 --> 02:21.456
I'll bet Waspinator seldom does.

02:21.555 --> 02:25.490
But try not to let it depress you, bug face.

02:29.724 --> 02:32.258

02:34.724 --> 02:38.026
The last hit breached the outer wall in Vector 7.

02:38.126 --> 02:41.025
And this was only the bad news?

02:41.126 --> 02:43.860
Yeah, the worse news is,

02:43.960 --> 02:45.626
it knocked out all the surveillance sensors

02:45.726 --> 02:47.427
along the southwest perimeter.

02:47.527 --> 02:49.560
Man, we might as well put up a sign saying,

02:49.660 --> 02:52.561
"Welcome Predacons. Enter here."

02:52.660 --> 02:57.628
Hm. With any luck, they're having problems of their own.

02:57.728 --> 03:01.329
( coughing )

03:01.429 --> 03:04.296
Go find out what's keeping Waspinator.

03:04.397 --> 03:06.864
( thunder crashes )

03:06.964 --> 03:08.930
So there you are.

03:09.031 --> 03:13.264
Yes. Here I am, at very long last.

03:13.364 --> 03:15.098
What happened to your voice?

03:15.198 --> 03:18.699
Allow me to present myself.

03:18.799 --> 03:23.733
Air Commander Starscream of the Decepticon battle fleet.

( thunder crashes )

03:26.134 --> 03:28.267
( dramatic theme playing )

03:30.968 --> 03:35.001
I-- I saw it myself. The entity came out of the computer.

03:35.101 --> 03:37.235
But you're ancient history.

03:37.335 --> 03:41.069
Ancient, yes. History, no.

03:41.169 --> 03:42.870
What's he talking about?

03:42.970 --> 03:45.870
The Decepticons were our ancestors.

03:45.970 --> 03:48.537
For centuries, they warred with the Autobots.

03:48.637 --> 03:51.437
The ancient ancestors of the Maximals.

03:51.537 --> 03:54.505
That war was lost, alas.

03:54.605 --> 03:56.304
And you were destroyed.

03:56.405 --> 03:59.472
It's written in the chronicles of Cybertron.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.472
Ah, so it was believed.

04:02.572 --> 04:06.874
I fell defending my leader, Galvatron,

04:06.974 --> 04:09.707
against the most powerful enemy of all.

04:09.807 --> 04:13.141
The giant Transformer Unicron.

04:13.241 --> 04:15.875
( dramatic theme playing )

04:15.975 --> 04:18.909
My exostructure was destroyed,

04:19.008 --> 04:23.143
but miraculously my spark endured,

04:23.243 --> 04:26.576
drifting helplessly through the depths of space,

04:26.676 --> 04:29.810
beyond the reach of time itself.

04:29.910 --> 04:31.878
Hm.

04:31.978 --> 04:35.412
And now that you're here, Air Commander,

04:35.512 --> 04:37.211
what do you want?

04:37.311 --> 04:42.679
Uh, why, to pledge allegiance to the glorious Megatron!

04:42.780 --> 04:46.347
And fight as your loyal lieutenant.

04:46.447 --> 04:49.580
Well, ahem, you'll forgive the glorious Megatron

04:49.680 --> 04:52.448
for not melting into a puddle of gratitude.

04:52.548 --> 04:56.281
Tell me, why should I trust you?

04:56.381 --> 05:00.816
Because I can show you how to crush the Maximals

05:00.916 --> 05:05.450
and win the beast wars once and for all.

05:05.550 --> 05:08.450
Hm.

05:08.550 --> 05:10.550
( dramatic theme playing )

05:12.751 --> 05:15.018
That's one thing about an energon storm.

05:15.118 --> 05:17.218
Doesn't do much for the view.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.352
And speaking of view,

05:20.452 --> 05:22.819
someone's gettin' a scanner full right now!

05:22.919 --> 05:24.986
Cheetor, maximize!

05:33.854 --> 05:37.555
We can repair it, but it's going to take time.

05:37.655 --> 05:39.055
CHEETOR (over comm link ): Yo, big bot.

05:39.156 --> 05:42.356
We were starring in someone's home video.

05:42.456 --> 05:45.623
Three guesses who was watchin' the movie.

05:46.689 --> 05:49.157
( beeping )

05:51.357 --> 05:55.992
My spark saw the damage before entering this body.

05:56.092 --> 05:59.892
It's the perfect opportunity to attack!

05:59.992 --> 06:02.359
But that's what they'll be waiting for.

06:02.459 --> 06:03.959
Exactly!

06:04.060 --> 06:07.527
Er, Starscream, perhaps the centuries of weightlessness

06:07.627 --> 06:10.627
have taken a toll on your neurological circuitry.

06:10.727 --> 06:14.394
While they're busy guarding the southwest,

06:14.494 --> 06:16.162
we strike here.

06:16.262 --> 06:21.129
Right through the gun points on the northeast wall.

06:21.229 --> 06:23.129
( suspenseful theme playing )

06:24.430 --> 06:26.063
What?

06:26.163 --> 06:28.097
They're attacking the other side!

06:28.197 --> 06:33.397
Hello, boys. Just happened to be in the neighborhood.

06:33.497 --> 06:36.064
So we thought we'd drop in.

06:36.165 --> 06:37.999
( grunts )

06:38.098 --> 06:41.199
Optimus, maximize!

06:41.299 --> 06:43.299
( grunts )

06:43.399 --> 06:45.766
( roars )

06:45.866 --> 06:48.367
Taken unawares. I'm a fool!

06:48.467 --> 06:51.567
At long last, Primal, we agree on something.

06:53.801 --> 06:56.401
( machines shorting out )

06:56.501 --> 06:58.501
( growling )

06:59.902 --> 07:03.203
Don't you know gate-crashing is just plain rude?

07:03.302 --> 07:05.236
Next time, try knockin'.

07:13.938 --> 07:15.337
Wha--? Huh?

07:17.172 --> 07:19.572
( growls )

07:19.672 --> 07:22.705
Since when did buzz brain learn that move?

07:22.806 --> 07:26.239
Since his exostructure was commandeered

07:26.339 --> 07:30.140
by the spark of Air Commander Starscream!

07:32.107 --> 07:35.774
Grr. Starscream? Impossible.

07:35.874 --> 07:37.775
( groans )

07:37.875 --> 07:39.642
We must pay attention, Dinobot.

07:39.742 --> 07:43.009
Otherwise, dearie me, look what happens.

07:46.277 --> 07:47.910
We've got to get out of here.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.410
Regroup and recover.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.044
What, and leave the place to the Preds?

07:52.144 --> 07:55.311
There's no choice, Rattrap. On my signal.

07:55.411 --> 07:57.045
Yeah, right.

07:57.145 --> 08:00.212
Like this rat needs instructions on leavin' a sinkin' ship.

08:02.379 --> 08:03.779
( grunts )

08:05.046 --> 08:08.914
Maximals! Full retreat!

08:09.014 --> 08:10.613
( groans )

08:12.914 --> 08:14.414
( cackles )

08:14.514 --> 08:16.648
Maximum burn.

08:17.614 --> 08:18.948
( grunts )

08:21.248 --> 08:24.283
Something tells me this isn't just a fire drill.

08:24.383 --> 08:27.316
I better find Tigatron.

08:30.451 --> 08:32.117
Victory!

08:32.217 --> 08:36.951
The Maximal base is mine. Yes.

08:37.051 --> 08:38.218
But what do we do now?

08:38.318 --> 08:41.718
If we're here, then our base is unprotected.

08:41.819 --> 08:44.920
MEGATRON: First we conquered. Now we divide.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.953
Tarantulas, Terrorsaur, you'll return with me.

08:48.053 --> 08:50.854
Scorponok and Blackarachnia will remain behind

08:50.954 --> 08:53.821
under the command of Starscream.

08:53.921 --> 08:57.855
Starscream? How come he gets promoted?

08:57.955 --> 08:59.322
( clears throat )

09:00.355 --> 09:02.055
( choking )

09:02.155 --> 09:05.356
Thus you are rewarded for your loyal service.

09:05.457 --> 09:08.924
And thus you are encouraged to keep your beak shut.

09:09.024 --> 09:10.224
( Terrorsaur grunts )

09:10.324 --> 09:14.791
I'm just grateful I had a chance to help.

09:14.891 --> 09:18.225
Yeah, I'll bet.

09:19.958 --> 09:23.725
We are well-pleased with Starscream so far,

09:23.826 --> 09:26.560
but watch him. Closely.

09:28.326 --> 09:30.327
( suspenseful theme playing )

09:36.228 --> 09:37.695
I bet one of them's in my room right now

09:37.795 --> 09:40.029
goin' through my stuff.

09:40.129 --> 09:42.962
Eh, don't take this the wrong way there, kitty cat,

09:43.062 --> 09:47.297
but under the circumstances, go tell someone who cares.

09:47.397 --> 09:49.263
( sighs )

09:49.363 --> 09:51.330
He'll make a full recovery.

09:51.430 --> 09:53.797
That's one less concern, at any rate.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.131
( growling )

09:55.231 --> 09:59.765
You should've stayed. Fought to the bitter end.

09:59.865 --> 10:02.799
And it would have been bitter, Dinobot.

10:02.899 --> 10:04.566
But there's no time for this.

10:04.666 --> 10:08.700
Apparently, Waspinator is Starscream, or he thinks he is.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.967
Either way, it's become a major problem.

10:11.067 --> 10:12.634
Especially since the files on him

10:12.733 --> 10:15.301
were classified by the Maximal elders.

10:15.401 --> 10:17.035
Fools!

10:17.135 --> 10:18.302
( snorts )

10:18.402 --> 10:23.036
Fortunately, I have long studied military history.

10:23.136 --> 10:24.069
OPTIMUS: Go on.

10:24.169 --> 10:27.070
Starscream was deceitful and scheming.

10:27.169 --> 10:31.337
The most notorious traitor of all.

10:31.437 --> 10:35.604
And now he's back and pledging his loyalty to Megatron.

10:35.704 --> 10:38.205
Hm.

10:44.139 --> 10:48.340
News update from your spy in the sky.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.474
Half the Preds just left the base.

10:50.574 --> 10:53.907
And guess who's in charge?

10:58.975 --> 11:02.843
Perhaps I'm being too oversensitive, Blackarachnia,

11:02.943 --> 11:05.809
but is there something you're not telling me?

11:05.909 --> 11:08.844
More like something you're not telling us.

11:08.944 --> 11:10.376
Such as?

11:10.477 --> 11:12.077
I scanned your file.

11:12.177 --> 11:15.244
You didn't get blasted to scrap metal by Unicron.

11:15.344 --> 11:19.712
You got blasted by Galvatron, after you betrayed him.

11:19.812 --> 11:23.745
Galvatron was a fool! I deserve to lead!

11:23.846 --> 11:26.813
So you know my little secret.

11:26.913 --> 11:28.580
Then the question remains,

11:28.680 --> 11:31.481
why did you not expose me to Megatron?

11:31.581 --> 11:35.681
Well, I thought you might make me a better offer.

11:38.181 --> 11:39.315
( chuckles )

11:39.415 --> 11:42.815
Greed and self-interest, eh? Excellent.

11:42.915 --> 11:46.716
I believe I discern a protégée.

11:46.816 --> 11:50.250
Starscream, the Maximals are approaching!

11:52.750 --> 11:54.750
( ominous theme playing )

12:09.553 --> 12:11.221
Starscream.

12:15.054 --> 12:18.322
We come to surrender.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.125
( grunts )

12:40.225 --> 12:41.725
Would you lie down?

12:41.825 --> 12:43.626
And groan, for cryin' out loud.

12:43.726 --> 12:46.060
You're supposed to be half-dead.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.026
Arrgh. If you don't shut up, rodent,

12:49.126 --> 12:52.227
you shall be my role model.

12:52.327 --> 12:54.161
Oh, yeah? You and whose--

12:54.261 --> 12:55.894
( Tigatron snarls, Rattrap gasps )

12:55.994 --> 12:58.361
All right, all right, I'm shuttin' up.

12:58.461 --> 13:03.696
If it ain't the dinosaurs up your nose, it's the felines.

13:03.796 --> 13:09.997
Surrender? Really. It seems too convenient.

13:10.097 --> 13:15.731
We have no choice. Dinobot's taken heavy damage.

13:15.831 --> 13:18.798
And you need access to the CR chamber.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.965
How nice for you.

13:21.065 --> 13:22.966
But what's in it for me?

13:23.066 --> 13:27.333
( sighing ): We'll... We'll do whatever you want.

13:28.833 --> 13:31.766
I accept. Bring him forward.

13:31.867 --> 13:34.834
Lesson one. Always show compassion.

13:34.934 --> 13:38.869
It's a useful cover for your true motives.

13:42.503 --> 13:45.769
Good. Now you reap the appropriate reward

13:45.870 --> 13:48.337
for your trust and good faith.

13:48.437 --> 13:49.803
Disarm him!

13:49.903 --> 13:51.303
Force him to transform

13:51.403 --> 13:56.037
and then chain him in the hold or somewhere.

13:56.137 --> 13:58.705
Attention, fools.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.838
The raptor and the ape are my prisoners.

14:01.938 --> 14:06.539
They will be destroyed unless you carry out my command.

14:06.639 --> 14:08.840
We had an agreement, Starscream.

14:08.939 --> 14:10.773
And now we have another one.

14:10.874 --> 14:14.174
If you wish to save the lives of your comrades,

14:14.274 --> 14:17.774
you will attack the Predacon base.

14:17.875 --> 14:20.108
The Pred base? What is this?

14:20.208 --> 14:22.475
It's called treachery.

14:22.575 --> 14:23.775
( grunts )

14:23.876 --> 14:25.409
( gasps then screams )

14:28.109 --> 14:29.710
( Scorponok grunts )

14:29.810 --> 14:34.143
You-- You're nothin' but a schemin' snake in the grass!

14:34.244 --> 14:37.345
Flattery will get you flattened, vermin.

14:37.445 --> 14:39.845
Obey me!

14:42.279 --> 14:44.979
We don't have a choice.

14:45.079 --> 14:46.980
( dramatic theme playing )

14:47.080 --> 14:48.880
( Optimus' chains clanking )

14:48.980 --> 14:49.913
( grunting )

14:50.013 --> 14:53.747
Betrayed, shackled and caged.

14:53.847 --> 14:57.281
In other words, so far, so good.

14:57.381 --> 14:59.082
( grunts )

15:00.781 --> 15:04.749
( grunting )

15:07.383 --> 15:09.717
Optimus, maximize!

15:26.986 --> 15:31.887
Lesson two. They're always more gullible than you'd hope.

15:31.987 --> 15:33.454
OPTIMUS: Lesson three.

15:33.554 --> 15:37.455
Disregard lessons one and two.

15:37.555 --> 15:38.921
( both grunt )

15:40.255 --> 15:42.389
He's no match for the two of us.

15:42.488 --> 15:44.756
Destroy him!

15:44.855 --> 15:46.456
( grunts )

15:46.556 --> 15:49.156
How about we make this a double date?

15:49.257 --> 15:51.891
( dramatic rock theme playing )

15:51.991 --> 15:55.690
Maximize!

15:56.891 --> 15:59.458
Very impressive, Optimus Primal.

15:59.558 --> 16:04.192
But I still have my wits and my superior speed.

16:05.526 --> 16:09.693
Thanks for the help. Remind me to return the favor.

16:12.426 --> 16:15.027
Optimus to Rhinox. Come in.

16:15.127 --> 16:16.628
( static )

16:16.728 --> 16:19.828
( sighing ): Too much interference. I have to get closer.

16:19.928 --> 16:21.395
Prime jets on!

16:24.462 --> 16:25.695
Hm.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.531
( suspenseful theme playing )

16:47.699 --> 16:48.933
( gasps )

16:54.034 --> 16:55.535
( gasps )

17:03.736 --> 17:06.303
( both shouting ): Rhinox!

17:12.170 --> 17:14.437
( both screaming)

17:16.337 --> 17:19.604
This is suicide. We gotta pull back.

17:25.373 --> 17:27.506
( Cheetor and Rattrap panting )

17:28.773 --> 17:30.706
STARSCREAM: No! Attack! What?

17:32.340 --> 17:34.674
That's an order!

17:36.174 --> 17:37.941
I have to tell you, Starscream,

17:38.041 --> 17:41.441
you're giving space debris a very bad name.

17:41.542 --> 17:45.209
Primal, you begin to irritate me!

17:45.309 --> 17:47.142
Big bot! All right!

17:47.242 --> 17:50.910
I'd say it's tramplin' time!

17:51.010 --> 17:52.010
( whirs )

17:52.110 --> 17:54.343
No. Leave him to me.

17:54.443 --> 17:55.911
He's mine.

17:56.011 --> 17:58.011
( dramatic rock theme playing )

18:07.346 --> 18:09.213
( screams )

18:12.680 --> 18:15.347
( groans )

18:18.581 --> 18:19.482
( grunts )

18:19.581 --> 18:21.448
Starscream and Blackarachnia.

18:21.549 --> 18:25.182
I'll have both their treacherous hides. Yes.

18:25.283 --> 18:28.349
I'll melt them down and use them for aluminum siding.

18:28.449 --> 18:29.816
Oh, yes, indeed!

18:29.917 --> 18:31.217
( growls )

18:31.317 --> 18:33.317
( dramatic rock theme playing )

18:42.485 --> 18:47.020
Oh, Optimus, my friend. We've been impetuous.

18:47.119 --> 18:50.353
Surely we can work something out.

18:50.453 --> 18:54.254
Blackarachnia, destroy him, and we can still triumph.

18:54.353 --> 18:56.488
Together!

18:56.588 --> 18:59.555
Are all your dreams in Technicolor?

19:00.888 --> 19:02.922
Energon.

19:06.389 --> 19:08.822
You've betrayed me!

19:08.923 --> 19:11.256
I studied with the master.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.559
Hasta la vista, Starscream.

19:21.659 --> 19:23.659
( screaming )

19:38.827 --> 19:44.129
Now Waspinator has a headache in his whole body.

19:44.229 --> 19:45.329
( groaning )

19:45.429 --> 19:47.162
It was the only way.

19:47.262 --> 19:49.263
I had to play along with Starscream

19:49.363 --> 19:52.363
to find out his true intentions.

19:52.463 --> 19:57.298
Hm. You're smooth, Blackarachnia. Very smooth.

19:57.398 --> 20:03.032
It does not inspire confidence. No.

20:03.132 --> 20:04.365
( chuckles )

20:04.465 --> 20:07.666
Neighbors. Invite 'em in and look what happens.

20:07.766 --> 20:12.034
Oh, well. Home, sweet home.

20:12.134 --> 20:14.700
Cheetor, planning to help with the cleanup?

20:14.800 --> 20:18.135
Eh, just checkin' for new constellations.

20:18.234 --> 20:21.268
Twinkle, twinkle, little Starscream.

20:24.268 --> 20:26.203
STARSCREAM: I'll be back!

20:26.303 --> 20:28.770
Even if it takes a thousand years,

20:28.870 --> 20:33.304
I'll be revenged on you all!

20:38.938 --> 20:40.971
( dramatic rock theme playing )
