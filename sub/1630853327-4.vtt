[cell door opens]

21:39.631 --> 21:40.757
[door closes]

21:49.641 --> 21:52.269
Each one of you gets nine grand a day.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.396
It's nine for a reason.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.398
Over ten gets reported.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.859
Exchange your cash for chips,

21:59.234 --> 22:02.946
you know, lose a few hands
at the game of your choice,

22:03.030 --> 22:06.199
and then cash out your cut,
one grand each.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.701
You dumb-asses got it?

22:08.452 --> 22:11.872
If there's one thing I can do well, boss,
it's lose at cards.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.206
-[murmuring]
-[laughing]

22:14.333 --> 22:17.044
Now, guys like you

22:17.127 --> 22:20.130
coming in with wads of cash
gets noticed.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.923
So, y'all need to have a story.

22:22.007 --> 22:26.803
For instance: "Oh, well,
I won it playing bingo at the VFW,"

22:26.928 --> 22:30.098
or "Old Auntie Dipshit
just left me a whole bundle

22:30.182 --> 22:31.892
and she dropped dead" and yada yada.

22:31.975 --> 22:35.812
I don't care what your fucking story is,
but you better fucking have one ready.

22:35.896 --> 22:39.232
And don't go buying any outboard motors.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.859
Not until next month.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.527
Are we clear?

22:47.240 --> 22:48.075
One second.

22:58.835 --> 22:59.669
All good?

23:01.046 --> 23:02.089
All good.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.931
I thought you told them
to wear their Sunday best.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.102
Well, you're looking at it.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.062
[soft scoff]

23:20.190 --> 23:21.024
No.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.573
We need folks we can trust.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.702
What, you telling me
you can't trust your own brother?

23:32.786 --> 23:34.037
I don't want him in this.

23:34.496 --> 23:35.831
We need bodies.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.418
Look, I'll keep my eye on him.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.211
I promise.

23:51.847 --> 23:52.764
[scoffs]

23:53.098 --> 23:55.976
[Ruth] All right!
Y'all get in a fucking line.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.186
[engine starts]

24:03.150 --> 24:05.527
[Charlotte]
These just came in for you to sign.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.113
Oh, just add them to the pile.

24:11.908 --> 24:12.784
Uh, Charlotte?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.496
I know how worried you are
about your Dad.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.123
If there's anything I can do...

24:19.708 --> 24:20.584
Thanks.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.841
How much do you know?

24:28.800 --> 24:29.759
Everything?

24:34.222 --> 24:36.224
Erin must never know.

24:37.142 --> 24:40.979
There will be consequences for anyone
who speaks truth to my daughter.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.439
Do you understand?

24:42.522 --> 24:43.607
[door shuts nearby]

24:45.317 --> 24:46.818
[voice trembles] I understand.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.035
And?

24:56.536 --> 24:58.079
So far, so good. [sighs]

24:58.163 --> 24:59.831
Ruth's got a team in place.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.666
And you're sure that she's up to it?

25:02.584 --> 25:03.919
Ruth? Oh, I trust her.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.170
Based on what?

25:06.671 --> 25:10.842
Based on the fact that Marty trusts her,
and she's devoted to him.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.095
And what if she's not devoted enough?

25:18.225 --> 25:20.185
Cross that bridge if we come to it.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.612
[dealer] All right, bet's closed.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.698
-Nineteen red.
-[woman groans]

25:33.823 --> 25:35.116
-[dealer] Sorry, folks.
-[man] Oh.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.336
-[dealer] And the dealer has a queen.
-Agh!

25:46.419 --> 25:48.755
-[dealer] Sorry, folks.
-[man] Oh, hell. I'm out.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.227
[dealer] Sixteen.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.356
-Bust. Sorry, sir.
-Ahh!

26:14.114 --> 26:15.824
-[door opens]
-[clears throat]

26:16.950 --> 26:18.118
-Hi there.
-Hi.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.005
I already fed him. He looked hungry.

26:30.338 --> 26:31.339
Thank you.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.676
Yeah, we're all about compliance here
at the Missouri Belle.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.803
On that note, do you have--

26:36.886 --> 26:40.557
Last night's take as well as midday counts
from the last hour.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.309
Thank you.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.399
[Maya sighs]

26:52.193 --> 26:54.696
So Marty's out of town.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.364
Yep.

26:59.743 --> 27:00.869
Where again?

27:01.369 --> 27:02.621
Kansas City.

27:04.539 --> 27:05.957
You hear from him?

27:08.001 --> 27:08.960
No.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.758
[Maya unzips bag]

27:20.055 --> 27:20.889
Hmm.

27:23.767 --> 27:24.684
What?

27:24.851 --> 27:28.980
There's a spike in this morning's numbers
compared to yesterday's.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.357
Oh, it's summer.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.692
Lake's always crazy busy in the summer.

27:32.942 --> 27:34.694
You'd think so, but...

27:35.320 --> 27:38.198
foot traffic appears
to be roughly the same.

27:39.532 --> 27:43.828
In fact, there were 5% fewer gamblers
on the floor this morning.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.625
Well, a lot of rich folks come here
for the summer.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.252
And rich folks love to gamble,
and they got the cash to do it.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.088
-[laughs]
-[clears throat]

27:55.590 --> 27:56.966
I'm gonna walk the floor.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.803
-I'll come with you.
-Not necessary.

28:11.481 --> 28:13.483
[Ben sighs]

28:18.655 --> 28:20.198
You're Ben Davis.

28:20.907 --> 28:22.242
Wendy Byrde's brother.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.289
When were you gonna show me your badge?

28:28.373 --> 28:31.459
Well, I considered this
a casual conversation.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.504
You don't strike me as a casual person.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.966
All right then, on the record...

28:39.134 --> 28:40.510
What are you doing here?

28:41.511 --> 28:43.304
Gambling. It's a casino.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.806
Your sister's casino.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.517
Kind of a win-win, wouldn't you say?

28:52.147 --> 28:54.023
What do you do for a living?

28:54.315 --> 28:55.900
Substitute teacher.

28:57.318 --> 28:59.154
I didn't know that paid so well.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.698
Pays for shit.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.451
I got a rich sister.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.874
Your brother-in-law still out sick?

29:12.417 --> 29:13.668
He's not sick.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.086
He's in Kansas City.

29:16.713 --> 29:17.589
[Maya] Hmm.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.340
Excuse me.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.929
I'm gonna have to ask you
not to disturb the players.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.226
[Maya] I'll see you tomorrow.

29:32.645 --> 29:33.730
And the next day.

29:35.857 --> 29:36.816
And the next.

[Marty] <i>It's, like, totally fixed.</i>

30:10.183 --> 30:12.227
I watched this guy,
number one on the leaderboard.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.270
I mean, his game play is awesome.

30:14.395 --> 30:17.440
And the only way he could keep winning
was to drop more quarters.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.525
Can you believe that?

30:18.608 --> 30:21.486
You can't just get good enough
and play through on one quarter.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.863
The only way you can win
is if you've got enough money--

30:23.947 --> 30:26.157
God damn it, Marty, we don't have
enough money for food,

30:26.241 --> 30:27.659

30:48.805 --> 30:50.265
What the fuck do you want?

30:50.723 --> 30:52.267
Tell me what you want.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.352
All right, I got a question for you.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.396
You want to break me?

30:56.771 --> 30:58.064
Is that what you want?

30:59.649 --> 31:02.026
You want me to tell you the truth?
You want me to confess?

31:02.110 --> 31:05.071
I don't trust my wife, and I fear you.

31:05.154 --> 31:07.407
You scare the fucking shit out of me.
The both of you do,

31:07.490 --> 31:09.576
with your fucking plans
about a legitimate casino.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.995
I've been against that since day one.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.963
And you want to know what else?

31:24.048 --> 31:25.341
I'm rooting for the other guy.

31:25.425 --> 31:29.053
I pray to God you lose your war,
and they chop your fucking head off.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.933
-That's a start.
-What?

-[lights buzzing]
-[footsteps retreating]

31:36.895 --> 31:38.021
Fuck you!

31:53.411 --> 31:54.245
Hi.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.541
Oh, thank you.

32:00.501 --> 32:01.836
Oh, God, thank you.

32:08.009 --> 32:08.927
What?

32:10.219 --> 32:12.597
-What is it? Spit it out.
-Um...

32:14.390 --> 32:15.683
[sighs]

32:15.808 --> 32:17.769
Um, it's about Helen.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.065
She knows that I know about Dad.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.567
And I'm-- I'm really sorry.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.319
I meant to keep it all a secret.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.115
Oh, it's all right.

32:32.742 --> 32:36.162
You wouldn't be the first person to be
outfoxed by Helen Pierce, so do not...

32:36.537 --> 32:38.039
do not beat yourself up.

32:40.249 --> 32:43.920
You know, there are times when you,
you just have to say to yourself...

32:45.046 --> 32:48.341
"I fucked up," and then--
and then you have to move on.

32:48.925 --> 32:51.094
God knows I have, more than you ever will.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.267
[doorbell rings]

33:01.729 --> 33:03.189
[Maya] <i>Do you know this man?</i>

33:09.028 --> 33:09.946
No.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.117
His name is Jorge Mendoza.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.745
He's a known operative
for the Navarro drug cartel.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.290
He was in the crowd
the night Marty disappeared.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.086
Marty's in Kansas City. [laughs]

33:25.169 --> 33:26.796
When was the last time
you spoke with him?

33:26.879 --> 33:27.964
The other night.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.008
Well...

33:30.633 --> 33:32.844
We had a little fight.
We haven't spoken since.

33:32.927 --> 33:35.930
So then you can't say for certain
he's in Kansas City.

33:39.475 --> 33:40.810
I suppose I can't.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.439
Wendy, it's my opinion

33:44.856 --> 33:48.693
and that of the Bureau, for that matter,
that your husband is in grave danger.

33:50.653 --> 33:51.612
Go on.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.699
We think Mendoza
abducted Marty that night.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.745
Took him to Mexico on a private jet.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.290
That's the cartel's MO.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.460
They're most likely torturing him.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.005
Maybe it's a loyalty test.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.635
Navarro's in the middle of a big war.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.221
There's a lot of tension down there.

34:18.473 --> 34:19.766
Whatever the reason...

34:21.350 --> 34:22.477
I'm sorry to say,

34:23.644 --> 34:26.230
I'm not sure if you'll
see your husband again.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.944
Then what is it you think
you can do for me?

34:33.154 --> 34:36.616
If a cartel kidnaps an American citizen
on US soil,

34:37.116 --> 34:39.577
we have cause to act on Mexican soil.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.748
We can go after him.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.626
We can go after Omar Navarro.

-There's never been a fucking problem.
-Tell us exactly what happened.

your daily bank transfers and...

Yes, like I've been doing
every fucking day

without a red fucking flag.

-[Helen] Why this account?
-I don't fucking know! I don't know!

37:21.822 --> 37:25.117
-What the fuck is a red flag anyway?
-It means that the account's frozen

37:25.201 --> 37:28.537
'cause the feds might think
that there's a crime being committed.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.456
-Like by me.
-You said you could handle things--

37:30.539 --> 37:33.334
I did what he taught me.
It's not my fucking fault!

You ever get the call about me...

38:27.138 --> 38:28.180
you'd let me know.

Yes.

get out of town.

39:51.972 --> 39:53.682
That's what my sister said.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.102
And her husband.

39:58.020 --> 39:58.979
Yeah.

39:59.563 --> 40:01.440
Things are gonna get ugly here.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.151
"Ugly" is my middle name.

40:09.448 --> 40:11.200
Actually, it's Jude.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.495
After St. Jude...

40:16.288 --> 40:19.125
patron saint of hopeless cases.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.045
-[bottles clink]
-Thanks, Mom and Dad.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.518
[clears throat] I'm, uh...

40:42.148 --> 40:45.443
I'm sorry my family put you
in their world of shit.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.279
[chuckles]

40:50.823 --> 40:54.785
I was in a world of shit
long before I met them.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.830
Well, I'm still sorry.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.376
And I'm not going anywhere
until I know you're safe.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.273
See you tomorrow, Jude.

41:35.034 --> 41:38.037
[heavy metal music continues blaring]

41:47.963 --> 41:49.965
[music fading out]

42:00.392 --> 42:02.394
[ventilator hissing]

42:03.938 --> 42:06.565
-[keys jingling]
-[cell door opens]

42:17.034 --> 42:19.370
[panting]

42:24.750 --> 42:26.502
[Navarro sighs]

42:26.627 --> 42:27.586
Where is my money?

42:29.463 --> 42:31.465
[panting]

42:38.931 --> 42:41.183
-You made them launder without me.
-Yes.

42:45.145 --> 42:47.147
And now you need to fix it.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.325
[typing]

43:03.622 --> 43:04.915
You have a red flag

43:05.499 --> 43:07.668
on a Panamanian deposit account.

43:08.627 --> 43:09.837
<i>That happens.</i>

43:10.254 --> 43:12.548
[typing rapidly]
All you have to do is you have to...

43:13.424 --> 43:15.134
clone the frozen assets,

43:17.261 --> 43:21.307
using a pre-authorized access code.

43:22.516 --> 43:23.559
And then,

43:23.642 --> 43:26.979
you have to redirect the deposit history

43:27.062 --> 43:28.564
in order to hide...

43:29.732 --> 43:30.899
the inter-bank transfer.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.903
You change the passcode twice

43:35.946 --> 43:39.366
so that you circumvent
the automated security checks.

43:40.951 --> 43:42.244
And then you're done.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.340
[sighs]

44:05.267 --> 44:06.602
[man] Get up. Get up.

44:06.685 --> 44:08.479
No, I did it. I did it!

44:08.562 --> 44:09.897
I did it, you fuck!

44:10.606 --> 44:13.942
I just fucking did it!
I did it, motherfucker!

44:14.026 --> 44:16.862
I fixed it! I won, motherfucker!

44:16.945 --> 44:19.782
<i>Hey! Look at me, fuckhead!</i>

44:20.240 --> 44:21.200
<i>Hey!</i>

44:29.208 --> 44:31.210
[bugs chirring]

45:02.032 --> 45:03.867
-Hi.
-I'm sorry.

45:04.034 --> 45:06.161
I didn't-- I didn't want to disturb you.

45:06.787 --> 45:07.996
It's all right.

45:08.580 --> 45:10.708
-Don't stay up too late.
-I won't.

45:11.917 --> 45:13.001
Are you okay?

45:14.753 --> 45:15.713
Yeah.

45:17.589 --> 45:19.049
-Good night.
-Night.

46:36.919 --> 46:37.878
Wen...

46:40.714 --> 46:41.757
Hey.

46:46.929 --> 46:48.680
-Shh.
-[sniffling]

47:33.642 --> 47:34.852
I know what I want.

47:35.727 --> 47:36.937
[Navarro] What is that?

47:38.397 --> 47:41.900
I want to launder
only when I say that it's safe.

47:42.276 --> 47:43.986
And when's that gonna be?

47:47.447 --> 47:49.533
When I compromise an FBI agent.

47:56.123 --> 47:57.499
"Compromise."

47:58.876 --> 47:59.960
I'll turn her.

48:01.837 --> 48:04.214
In a matter of months,
she's gonna be working for me.

48:04.965 --> 48:06.258
And then we're all safe.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.346
And is that it?

48:13.849 --> 48:15.267
Is that all you want, Marty?

48:27.946 --> 48:29.197
How about you thank me?

48:33.452 --> 48:35.203
How about you say thank you to me?

48:38.206 --> 48:39.374
Can you do that?

48:48.008 --> 48:49.217
[laughs]

48:52.137 --> 48:54.181
[clears throat, sniffles]

48:57.309 --> 48:58.435
[Marty sighs]

49:14.201 --> 49:16.536
[vehicle approaching]

49:58.537 --> 50:00.539
