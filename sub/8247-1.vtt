04:06.920 --> 04:09.520
This, it was given me to know:

04:10.280 --> 04:15.760
that many worlds have been enslaved
by the Beast and his army, the Slayers.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.440
And this, too, was given me to know:

04:20.160 --> 04:24.400
that the Beast would come to our world,
the world of Krull...

04:24.720 --> 04:28.120
...and his Black Fortress would be seen
in the land...

04:28.880 --> 04:32.920
...that the smoke of burning villages
would darken the sky...

04:33.320 --> 04:37.640
...and the cries of the dying echo
through deserted valleys.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.960
But one thing I cannot know:

04:42.120 --> 04:44.520
whether the prophecy be true...

04:45.080 --> 04:48.560
...that a girl of ancient name
shall become queen...

04:49.160 --> 04:54.600
...that she shall choose a king, and that
together they shall rule our world...

04:55.160 --> 04:59.400
...and that their son shall rule the galaxy.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.880
Father!

05:19.040 --> 05:21.160
Colwyn should have been here by now.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.880
He may be forced to travel
through the forests on the stone country.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.960
All the passes and roads
are held by the Slayers.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.200
Colwyn may not get through.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.080
That would please you?

05:32.160 --> 05:33.520
I sent men to help!

05:34.080 --> 05:37.480
But I see no reason for an alliance
with our ancient enemies.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.640
Father, the invaders
are destroying our world.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.720
We must have the alliance.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.880
Only if we're united,
do we stand a chance against them.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.760
Then, I'll make a treaty with King Turold.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.040
It's not necessary for you to marry his son.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.840
It's the only way to guarantee the alliance.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.920
The marriage is my choice.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.280
If it were anyone but Turold's son...

06:02.800 --> 06:04.520
Colwyn is a great fighter.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.880
Good fighters make bad husbands.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.000
Perhaps.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.240
Horsemen approaching!

06:51.120 --> 06:52.520
Open the gate!

07:06.840 --> 07:10.080
We sent to you for help. None came.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.160
Twenty men were despatched to you.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.320
We've lost 300 getting here.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.600
I didn't choose this marriage, Turold.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.360
Nor did I, Eirig!

07:19.600 --> 07:23.760
I chose it! Your daughter chose it!
It'll be done!

07:24.200 --> 07:27.680
And you'll lead this army with mine
against the Slayers?

07:27.840 --> 07:30.320
Whatever army I have,
I'll lead against them...

07:30.400 --> 07:33.200
...until I've won or I'm dead.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.640
I have chosen well.

07:58.840 --> 07:59.880
So have I.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.800
Your journey was hard?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.120
But necessary.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.280
- May already be too late.
- It's not too late.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.240
Is this where the...

08:18.440 --> 08:19.560
...ceremony will be?

08:20.840 --> 08:22.280
Tonight at moonrise.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.480
My father says that good fighters
make bad husbands.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.280
- That depends.
- On what?

08:32.400 --> 08:35.440
On whether you expect a husband
to follow you around...

08:35.600 --> 08:37.480
...jump every time you clap your hands.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.200
Wouldn't you jump for me?

08:41.080 --> 08:44.520
No, of course not.
You're a warrior.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.120
From this day, my kingdom is no more.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.720
Nor mine.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.840
A single kingdom under our children.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.320
Agreed.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.600
I give fire to water.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.880
It will not return, except from the hand
of the woman I choose as my wife.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.080
I take fire from water.

11:10.240 --> 11:13.200
I give it only to the man
whom I choose as my husband.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.800
Take the fire from my hand.

11:33.840 --> 11:34.800
Slayers!

11:34.840 --> 11:36.800
Slayers!
- Slayers!

11:37.840 --> 11:39.200
Slayers are coming!

11:43.720 --> 11:45.440
Call the roll, guards!

11:45.640 --> 11:47.000
- Slayers!
- Arm yourselves!

11:47.120 --> 11:50.080
- We'll fight together.
- No. Is there a safe way out of the castle?

11:50.120 --> 11:52.520
- An underground passage.
- Go!

12:04.160 --> 12:05.680
My place is with you!

12:06.000 --> 12:07.960
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.040
Then go.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.920
Colwyn, hurry back to me.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.120
Everyone in the centre of the room,
get back!

13:06.640 --> 13:07.600
Take it!

13:46.080 --> 13:46.960
Here!

14:39.600 --> 14:40.640
Colwyn!

14:42.880 --> 14:43.840
Lyssa!

14:48.160 --> 14:49.760
Colwyn!

14:50.400 --> 14:51.360
Help!

14:51.440 --> 14:52.360
Colwyn!

14:53.640 --> 14:54.560
Father!

14:55.520 --> 14:57.400
Colwyn!

17:15.920 --> 17:16.680
Lyssa!

17:16.800 --> 17:17.880
She's alive.

17:18.359 --> 17:19.280
Where?

17:19.560 --> 17:20.640
Stay still!

17:21.200 --> 17:22.200
Where?

17:22.400 --> 17:24.480
For now, beyond your reach.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.520
Who are you?

17:31.160 --> 17:32.280
I am Ynyr.

17:34.360 --> 17:35.440
The Old One.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.520
Well...

17:38.320 --> 17:39.520
...not as old as all that.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.320
You've come down
from the Granite Mountains.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.280
Yes.
I am needed now.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.320
Father!

18:04.840 --> 18:06.720
There's no time now for grief!

18:11.200 --> 18:15.200
You haven't lost a father
and a bride on the same day.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.880
Nor have I become king on that day!

18:19.800 --> 18:21.440
I have no kingdom!

18:22.240 --> 18:24.640
Your kingdom may be greater
than you know.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.560
I give it to you, old man,
and welcome to it.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.000
I came to find a king...

18:32.320 --> 18:34.480
...and I find a boy instead.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.280
Lyssa?

18:46.800 --> 18:49.240
They will hold her in the Black Fortress.

18:55.280 --> 18:56.840
Can you lead me to it?

18:57.240 --> 18:58.680
You must have help.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.600
I'll find men on the way.

19:02.840 --> 19:06.240
In the Fortress,
you will face more than the Slayers.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.840
You will face the Beast,
who is their leader.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.560
He can be killed.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.440
Perhaps.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.080
But no man has ever seen him and lived.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.640
You will need more than men and swords.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.200
You will need the power of the Glaive.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.360
The Glaive is nothing
but an ancient symbol.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.120
It doesn't really exist.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.320
It exists,
up there.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.520
In a cave on the highest peak.

19:49.240 --> 19:53.680
Without the Glaive,
you will never be able to reach Lyssa.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.560
I need weapons, not symbols.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.680
Once, the Glaive was
a very powerful weapon.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.640
It can be so again.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.000
But only in the hands of the right man.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.280
For only the right man
can retrieve the Glaive.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.120
Am I that man?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.520
I wish I knew.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.960
I cannot go with you.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.680
Don't worry. If it's there,
I'll come back with it.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.920
If you do not come back with it...

20:27.040 --> 20:28.960
...you'll not come back at all.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.400
You have been brought here for a marriage.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.480
I am the king you will choose.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.120
Do not use it until you need it.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.800
- How will I know when?
- You'll know.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.600
If you lead me to the Black Fortress,
I'll use it soon enough.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.400
That will not be so easy.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.840
At each sunrise, the Black Fortress moves.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.880
Sometimes it is in the mountains,
sometimes in the desert...

26:38.960 --> 26:40.480
...sometimes in the sea.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.440
Never the same place twice.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.080
But you told me you knew where to find it!

26:47.800 --> 26:50.600
There are kingly virtues other than bravery.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.120
Courtesy is one of them!

26:56.400 --> 26:57.760
I'm sorry.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.000
It's the thought of Lyssa there.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.440
Yes...

27:08.000 --> 27:09.440
Yes.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.080
Well, I, too, was young...

27:13.440 --> 27:14.400
...once.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.280
I, too, loved as you do.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.920
But your love will be...

27:25.120 --> 27:26.560
...luckier than mine.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.240
What I told you is that I knew
how to find the Fortress...

27:32.280 --> 27:36.360
...and that is by seeking the vision
of the blind Emerald Seer.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.120
But his place isn't known either.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.360
It is known to me.
It is a day's journey from here. Come.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.240
Help!

28:30.880 --> 28:33.520
Help! I'm drowning!

28:35.080 --> 28:37.520
This might have been quicksand!

28:39.280 --> 28:43.080
I might have been sucked to my death
while you stood there gawking!

28:45.880 --> 28:47.320
Where is this place?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.160
A forest near the Granite Mountains.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.680
Blast! 1,000 miles off course.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.560
Well, I was rushed.

28:57.840 --> 29:01.200
There was a difference of opinion
concerning a gooseberry pie.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.680
The man
left it sitting on his windowsill.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.080
- What did he expect?
- Perhaps he expected to eat it.

29:10.480 --> 29:14.240
For that rudeness, lout,
I think I'll turn you into a bat.

29:15.320 --> 29:20.160
Might teach you some manners
to hang upside down for an hour or two.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.520
The Hill People lack the power to do harm.

29:23.880 --> 29:27.200
We shall see about that, old man.
We'll see about that!

29:28.160 --> 29:31.640
No, that's a recipe for hot fudge sauce.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.360
Oh well, it'll have to be a goose.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.240
Fat and ugly.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.080
Very fat. Very ugly.

29:53.760 --> 29:58.360
From that, you see what I could've done
to you if I were a vengeful man.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.840
You may leave me now.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.240
Dear, dear. Let me see now...

30:18.880 --> 30:21.520
The forest is not safe,
you'd best travel with us.

30:21.600 --> 30:25.680
Me, travel with you?
Do you know who I am?

30:26.320 --> 30:27.040
No.

30:27.160 --> 30:32.880
I am Ergo the Magnificent.
Short in stature, tall in power...

30:33.080 --> 30:35.840
...narrow of purpose and wide of vision.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.600
And I do not travel with peasants
and beggars. Goodbye.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.000
Wait! Wait for me!

31:08.760 --> 31:12.080
I've just remembered
I have urgent business in this direction.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.360
What business?

31:15.320 --> 31:16.760
Staying alive.

31:48.480 --> 31:52.640
I will allow you to go
wherever you please within these walls.

31:53.440 --> 31:58.720
For this is the palace from which you
will rule this world and countless others.

32:00.880 --> 32:05.120
You cannot escape me.
You will be my queen.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.640
You're no great chooser of roads, old man.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.520
This way will save us half a day's travel.

32:57.480 --> 32:58.600
Robbers.

32:59.600 --> 33:02.120
They're men, we don't know yet
whether they're robbers.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.160
Faces that ugly
could only belong to robbers.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.720
Don't worry. I'll turn them all into pigs.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.680
You're surrounded by a hundred men!

33:32.920 --> 33:34.560
A hundred is not enough!

33:37.280 --> 33:40.440
Well, what have we here? A fighter!

33:43.440 --> 33:45.400
Besides, you're short about 90 men.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.680
Let's just kill them and be done with it.

33:47.840 --> 33:51.760
Soft, Rhun! I don't kill men
without good reason.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.800
Nor do I. And be thankful for it.

34:01.520 --> 34:02.960
You're escaped prisoners.

34:03.040 --> 34:07.960
Every one. Thieves, bandits,
fighters and brawlers.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.520
Desperate men.

34:10.679 --> 34:13.280
- As desperate as you'll ever see.
- Good.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.360
Those are the kind of men I need.

34:16.719 --> 34:17.840
You need?

34:19.800 --> 34:23.280
Well, see, these men
follow no man but me...

34:24.000 --> 34:25.639
...and I follow no man at all.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.440
- Would you follow a king?
- A king?

34:30.639 --> 34:34.639
Many lunatics wandering
through the countryside claiming to be kings, huh?

34:37.440 --> 34:40.080
Would you follow a king
to the Black Fortress?

34:40.360 --> 34:42.159
Now I know you're a lunatic.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.719
I wouldn't follow my own father
to the Black Fortress.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.800
- If he could find it!
- Not that he'd be foolish enough to do such a thing.

34:47.880 --> 34:51.440
Is it foolish to defend your world?
To fight for your homes and families?

34:51.520 --> 34:54.400
If the invaders conquer,
you'll be slaves with the rest of us.

34:54.480 --> 34:57.120
Noble sentiments, but we fight for profit.

34:57.200 --> 35:00.880
- You know what I mean?
- But the profit's freedom. And fame.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.120
Freedom?
But we have it.

35:04.200 --> 35:07.000
And fame, nah,
it's an empty purse.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.480
Count it, go broke...

35:10.120 --> 35:12.160
...eat it, go hungry...

35:12.600 --> 35:14.200
...seek it and go mad.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.080
That is true.

35:16.720 --> 35:20.360
But this fame and this freedom
you could leave to your sons.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.160
How did you know I had sons?

35:31.240 --> 35:34.400
If the Slayers conquer Krull,
your sons will be enslaved.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.520
Forever.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.600
I have no sons,
but I will go with you.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.360
The boy shames you all.

35:58.800 --> 36:02.440
Only the king and the lord marshal
have the keys to these manacles.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.680
- You don't look like a lord marshal.
- No.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.840
You look about the right age
to be Turold's son.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.600
The exact age.

36:13.160 --> 36:16.040
Torquil, you're growing old.
Your brain's softening.

36:16.880 --> 36:19.040
Nine men like you are worth an army.

36:33.080 --> 36:36.840
If we succeed, unlock them.
Otherwise, I'll die with them.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.600
Well, you heard him! We're now an army!

36:43.640 --> 36:45.000
An unpaid army.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.560
You got a problem, Rhun?

36:46.720 --> 36:49.840
Can't a man even talk to himself
without being interrupted?

36:50.240 --> 36:51.120
Let's go!

36:51.200 --> 36:54.200
- Come along!
- Nennog! Move!

37:03.320 --> 37:04.680
Gooseberries!

37:31.120 --> 37:32.040
Ergo!

37:33.240 --> 37:34.480
Ynyr, help!

38:00.200 --> 38:03.520
Horrible! Horrible!
There was a terrible creature over there.

38:03.720 --> 38:06.440
And over there,
a creature with only one eye.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.560
- One eye?
- A Cyclops.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.880
He was aiming a spear straight at me.

38:11.520 --> 38:15.320
Had that been so, you would now be dead.
He was aiming at a Slayer...

38:15.440 --> 38:18.320
...for they have ancient hatred
between them.

38:19.800 --> 38:22.240
Long ago, his ancestors...

38:22.640 --> 38:24.640
...lived in a world far from Krull.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.320
And had...

38:29.320 --> 38:31.680
...two eyes like other men.

38:33.040 --> 38:36.760
Then they made a bargain with the Beast
who is the leader of the Slayers.

38:36.880 --> 38:40.280
They gave up one of their eyes
in exchange for the power...

38:41.160 --> 38:44.240
...to see into the future.
But they were cheated.

38:45.680 --> 38:48.560
For the only future
they are permitted to see...

38:49.520 --> 38:51.280
...is the time of their own death.

38:51.320 --> 38:55.880
They're sad, solitary creatures,
born to know...

38:57.760 --> 38:59.440
...the day they will die.

39:00.200 --> 39:03.200
Today would have been my day,
if it hadn't been for him.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.120
Up you go.

39:13.640 --> 39:16.280
We three will go on.
The rest will remain here.

39:16.360 --> 39:20.320
We four will go on. I'm not staying behind
with these criminals!

39:21.600 --> 39:23.120
We four will go.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.480
He marches us
towards a solid face of rock.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.200
The man has raisins in his braincase.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.880
I recognise an old friend.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.720
Mad. They're all mad!

41:23.160 --> 41:25.320
We seek the Black Fortress.

41:27.440 --> 41:31.040
Such a vision will be opposed.
Who seeks it?

41:31.440 --> 41:32.840
The new king.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.280
With an old voice?

41:35.920 --> 41:37.680
You know the voice?

41:40.480 --> 41:41.920
Yes, my friend.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.080
We're trying to find the-

41:54.440 --> 41:56.840
I will seek the Fortress for you.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.000
- Got any sugarballs?
- No.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.320
- Gumdrops?
- No.

42:34.480 --> 42:37.440
What kind of boy are you?
Boys always have candy.

42:40.040 --> 42:41.680
I have a cinnamon bar.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.320
Share and share alike.

42:48.920 --> 42:51.200
I am Ergo the Magnificent.

42:51.720 --> 42:56.240
Short in stature, tall in power,
narrow of purpose and wide of vision.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.240
That is very impressive.

42:58.720 --> 42:59.960
I should hope so.

43:00.080 --> 43:01.120
I'm Titch.

43:01.440 --> 43:04.000
That's not impressive,
but adequate, adequate.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.280
Black Fortress.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.720
Where is it?

44:12.600 --> 44:14.040
Are you all right?

44:14.800 --> 44:15.760
Yes.

44:17.040 --> 44:21.360
The Beast does not like
curious Seers poking into his affairs.

44:22.120 --> 44:25.120
His power is too great
for you to overcome?

44:25.520 --> 44:29.560
Yes, here. But there is one place
where his power cannot reach.

44:30.640 --> 44:31.800
The Emerald Temple.

44:31.920 --> 44:35.080
Yes. In that place,
he cannot oppose my vision.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.680
Will you travel there with us?

44:37.840 --> 44:40.920
It is in the Great Swamp,
a treacherous place.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.160
Our need is great.

45:15.120 --> 45:20.520
The Temple is at the centre of the Swamp,
where three trees grow as one.

45:21.680 --> 45:24.320
How can anything grow in that place?
It smells of death.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.680
Death and power are close cousins.

45:27.160 --> 45:29.640
Don't think I like your relatives, old man.

45:43.000 --> 45:43.560
Kegan.

45:45.920 --> 45:47.120
Have a look.

45:47.480 --> 45:49.160
The profit of this journey.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.880
They worth a fortune.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.920
Maybe.
To someone who's very nearsighted.

45:58.240 --> 45:59.120
What?

46:02.320 --> 46:03.960
But they were emeralds!

46:04.280 --> 46:05.880
Hey, Rhun, emeralds.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.200
I swear it! They were emeralds!

46:12.320 --> 46:16.800
Rocks in our pockets and gravestones
above our heads is all we'll get from this journey.

46:48.520 --> 46:50.280
Slayers!
Slayers!

46:50.360 --> 46:52.160
- From the lake!
- Take cover!

46:52.280 --> 46:54.240
- Over here!
- Get down.

46:58.520 --> 46:59.680
- Get down there!

46:59.800 --> 47:00.800
Come on, over here!

47:00.960 --> 47:01.920
- On the other side!

47:03.360 --> 47:04.600
- Move, move!

47:06.240 --> 47:07.520
- Get over here!

47:09.080 --> 47:10.600
Quick, over there!

47:12.760 --> 47:13.800
- Keep them away!
- Aye!

48:21.600 --> 48:22.680
Colwyn!

48:25.760 --> 48:26.960
Over here!

48:37.440 --> 48:40.320
That's the second time
you've saved my life.

48:40.760 --> 48:43.200
- I am Ergo.
- The Magnificent.

48:49.040 --> 48:50.560
Hasn't he got a name?

48:50.840 --> 48:52.320
His name is Rell.

48:52.480 --> 48:55.960
He visits the Seer sometimes.
He doesn't speak much.

48:56.040 --> 49:00.040
So I've noticed. Except to be sarcastic
to people who wish to be friends.

49:00.360 --> 49:03.560
Or jest
with those who already are his friends.

49:04.000 --> 49:09.160
My name is no jest, beanpole.
It's all very well to have a short name when you're 20 feet tall...

49:09.280 --> 49:12.360
...but small people need large names
to give them weight.

49:12.680 --> 49:18.200
Your actions give you weight, my friend.
I saw you save the boy from a spear.

49:18.360 --> 49:21.320
Well, that's what friends are supposed
to do for each other.

49:21.600 --> 49:22.680
Quite so.

49:22.840 --> 49:25.120
You've been with us for a long way now.

49:25.280 --> 49:29.120
Since the beginning.
When I learned that the Old One had come down...

49:29.280 --> 49:31.360
...I knew that the time had come.

49:32.280 --> 49:35.320
Join us, then.
All men need company.

49:36.160 --> 49:37.120
Yes.

49:38.320 --> 49:39.480
All men.

49:50.320 --> 49:51.440
That way.

49:53.720 --> 49:57.400
If I had my wish,
I'd be out of this gloomy place right away.

49:58.080 --> 50:02.440
If I really had my wish,
I'd be sitting on top of a gooseberry pie...

50:02.560 --> 50:04.440
...as big as a mountain.

50:04.640 --> 50:08.080
No, that's a bit greedy.
I'll settle for one as big as a house.

50:08.160 --> 50:09.720
I'd wish for a puppy.

50:09.920 --> 50:13.640
Only one puppy? If you're wishing,
why not wish for 100?

50:13.920 --> 50:14.880
I only want one.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.160
That's a foolish wish.
And you, Rell, what would you wish for?

50:19.520 --> 50:20.560
Ignorance.

50:51.120 --> 50:52.000
No!

51:25.800 --> 51:26.960
- Nennog!
- Help!

51:27.080 --> 51:28.160
Help him!

51:28.400 --> 51:29.920
The ground. It's sinking!

51:30.040 --> 51:32.240
It is the power
of the Beast.

51:32.560 --> 51:35.640
- Link up! Make a chain!
- Help! Get me out!

51:35.760 --> 51:37.360
Rhun, get hold of him!

51:38.400 --> 51:39.640
- Hurry, hurry!

51:48.760 --> 51:50.160
- Hang on!
- Pull!

51:52.680 --> 51:54.240
Give me the axe!

51:57.120 --> 51:58.000
Here!

52:00.800 --> 52:01.760
Pull!

52:05.280 --> 52:06.320
Pull!

52:12.960 --> 52:14.720
I'm slipping in!

52:15.920 --> 52:16.920
Pull it!

52:17.120 --> 52:17.840
Hold on! Hold on!

52:25.480 --> 52:26.480
Menno!

52:31.160 --> 52:32.200
Help me!

52:41.400 --> 52:42.880
Get me out! Help me!

52:42.960 --> 52:43.880
Hang on, Menno!

52:55.840 --> 52:58.640
Menno! Keep still!
- Don't struggle!

53:01.280 --> 53:02.240
- Reach
- Hold on!

53:02.480 --> 53:03.520
Reach!

53:05.200 --> 53:06.760
Keep still, Menno!

53:06.880 --> 53:08.320
Don't struggle!
- Stretch!

53:12.200 --> 53:13.120
Pull!

53:13.760 --> 53:14.280
Pull!

53:15.360 --> 53:15.840
Pull!

53:17.840 --> 53:18.400
Pull!

53:19.440 --> 53:20.000
Pull!

53:27.840 --> 53:28.960
Menno!

54:03.280 --> 54:05.040
Is that you, Titch?

54:23.240 --> 54:25.640
- How far to the Temple?
- Not far now.

54:28.960 --> 54:31.440
Oswyn, stay here and
make sure we're not being followed.

54:31.440 --> 54:31.840
- Right.

54:31.840 --> 54:34.080
- I will stay.
- Be careful.

54:43.520 --> 54:44.720
Thank you.

54:46.920 --> 54:49.440
I'll lead the Seer.
Titch, you go ahead.

54:49.960 --> 54:51.680
Thank you, brother.

55:02.400 --> 55:06.080
I'll lead the Seer.
You go ahead with Titch.

55:27.680 --> 55:29.080
- This way?
- No.

55:31.160 --> 55:32.240
You sure?

55:35.040 --> 55:36.760
I recognise this tree.

55:41.040 --> 55:43.000
I recognise the place now.

56:18.160 --> 56:20.080
We're in sight of the trees, brother.

56:20.160 --> 56:23.200
He who seeks the knowledge
must lead me.

56:23.960 --> 56:25.920
No one else may approach.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.560
Here is the knowledge you seek!

57:31.480 --> 57:33.120
- Come on!
- This way, this way!

57:39.600 --> 57:41.400
- Hurry!
- What's going on?

57:46.600 --> 57:49.320
The Beast has many weapons.
This was one of them.

57:51.920 --> 57:53.360
The Changeling.

57:58.040 --> 57:59.520
How did you know?

57:59.720 --> 58:02.240
I found the Seer's body in the quicksand.

58:06.760 --> 58:08.400
He gave his life for us.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.080
He was my only family.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.600
We're your family now.

58:29.440 --> 58:32.040
Now we have no way
to find the Black Fortress.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.760
There is one who might help.

58:36.880 --> 58:37.840
Who?

58:38.800 --> 58:40.280
The Widow of the Web.

58:40.640 --> 58:44.040
That creature helps no one.
And none who go there return.

58:44.240 --> 58:47.120
- She has great powers.
- Yeah, to kill.

58:47.920 --> 58:52.440
She may not kill me,
for I know her name.

58:53.960 --> 58:55.440
Her name is Death.

58:56.480 --> 59:01.120
She had another name once.
An ancient and powerful name.

59:08.920 --> 59:13.520
We all risk our lives on this journey,
my risk is no greater than yours.

59:19.440 --> 59:20.680
I must try.

59:53.520 --> 59:55.040
Where are my papers?

59:56.400 --> 59:59.880
Blast, I really must get organised
one of these days.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.240
Puppy!

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.240
Where's Ergo?

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.280
He's...

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.360
He'll be back soon.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.600
From here, I go on alone.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.080
- I'm going with you.
- No.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.120
If two approach,
she would certainly kill both.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.840
Alone, I may have a chance.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.920
Each to his fate, Colwyn.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.600
Yeah.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.560
Yes,
each to his fate.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.720
If I'm not back by morning...

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.560
...you'll know mine.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.720
We stay here.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.200
I still say it was a foolish wish.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.120
We have no food,
and the men are too tired to hunt.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.160
- Hey, Kegan.
- Hello.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.320
Doesn't one of your wives
live in a village near here?

01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:00.000
Lona. No.
No, she moved down to the river.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.560
How many wives does he have?

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.120
About seven or eight, at the last count.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.600
Well, he's a travelling man, you see?

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.920
He covers a lot of ground.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.480
Merith.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.560
She lives in a village
at the edge of the giant trees.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.600
Can she cook?

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.560
It's not her strongest point,
but here, I tell you.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.680
Hey, just have her bring provisions, aye?
Magnificence there reckons he can cook.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.280
We'll soon see.
- Oh yeah?

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.480
Plenty more if you're still hungry.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.640
Out of my way. Let me get at it.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.800
- Well?
- Well, what?

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.160
Who's the girl there?

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.720
Her village was burned.
She'd nowhere to go, so I took her in.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.360
Look at her one more time,
and I'll throw her out!

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.040
Merith!
Oh, my sweet.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.920
She doesn't hold a candle to you.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.120
- She's not even pretty.
- Yeah?

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.640
Now, look, petal,
"faithful" is my middle name.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.800
You must eat something.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.600
I'm not hungry.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.400
Please,
for me.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.120
Thank you.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.880
What troubles you?

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:12.000
You have chosen a paltry kingdom
on an insignificant planet.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.520
And love.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.120
Love is fleeting.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.880
Power is eternal.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.800
Such is my power.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.640
It can be yours.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.120
I don't want your power.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.120
Do not let my form frighten you...

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.200
...Lyssa.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:50.400
I can assume any form I wish.
Any form you wish.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.680
There's no love in that form.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.640
And you think there's love
in your boy king?

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.200
I've not held a man in my arms
since my lover left.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.520
This is a lie!

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.040
I know how painful it is
to be far from your lover.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.520
He will betray you.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.360
Comfort me for one night.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.680
He will not.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.440
I can't betray my bride.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.120
Then he will die.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.600
Let me comfort you.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:26.000
I can't accept comfort when she has none.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.280
You will not then?

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.800
I cannot.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.120
My master said:
"Make him betray her. If not, kill him."

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:46.560
Yes, he is my master. These talons
were a heartbeat away from your throat.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.360
I could have killed you in an instant.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.200
But, in the hour I knew you, I loved you.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.800
It is you who are betrayed!

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.840
Power is fleeting. Love is eternal.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.120
Remember me.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.720
- This way, this way!

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:07.680
- What is it?
- Come on!

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.240
Consider this power:
If you consent to be my queen...

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.600
...I will halt the attacks of the Slayers.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.520
It is in your power
to stop the killing and burning.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:24.279
Each hour you delay,
more innocent people will be killed.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.960
Think on it.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.120
Hurry, Colwyn.

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:07.319
I seek the Widow!

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.319
Enter here and die.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.040
Lyssa!

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.360
Lyssa!

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.880
Who speaks that name?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.960
It is I, Ynyr!

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.080
I give you
this time.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.120
Lyssa.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.560
I was young when I last heard that name.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.040
I was young when I last spoke it to you.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.000
And my face
was as beautiful as my name.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.120
And I loved you, Lyssa,
with all my heart.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.720
But you would not stay with me.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:02.240
- There were responsibilities, duty...
- Ambition.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.320
You had a son.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.520
We had a son.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.360
But you said nothing.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.480
Where is he?

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.560
I killed him when he was born.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.920
And this is my punishment.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:30.880
My son?

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.760
Since I could not kill you,
my rage needed a victim.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.760
I know you can never forgive me.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.600
I cannot forgive myself.
I have already forgiven you.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.040
You can never forgive a woman
who has killed your son.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.480
If I had not...

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.160
...could I see you now as I saw you then?

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.600
And allow me to see through your eyes.

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.080
How could I have left you?

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.960
Your vision is your gift to me.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.600
And your vision could be your gift to me.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.480
- What can I see for you?
- The Black Fortress, where does it rise?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.120
Tomorrow...

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.880
...in the Iron Desert.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.880
But the knowledge is useless to you,
for you cannot leave here.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.960
No man has ever escaped the Web.

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.840
There is a young girl being held
in the Fortress.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.880
A young girl with your name.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.800
A young man seeks her.

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.160
A young man...

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.800
...the age I was when...

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.800
...you and I met.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.400
When you and I loved.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.840
What you ask is beyond my power.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.960
It can be turned only once.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.800
That is the Lure of the Web.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:40.680
Then the second Lyssa will share your fate.
She will die, grown old and lonely.

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:46.800
She will die in a place of darkness.
This whole world will be a place of darkness!

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.400
These are the sands of my life.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:03.160
Accept them and the spider
will have no power to harm you.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.400
But your own life runs out with the sand.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.360
What about your life?

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.800
I give it to the girl who bears my name.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.280
I... cannot...
stop the sand.

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:28.560
You cannot stop time.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.440
Go now.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.240
Save the other Lyssa.

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.080
At sunrise...

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.960
At sunrise...

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.840
...the Black Fortress will appear...

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.480
...in the Iron Desert.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.600
It will remain there until
sunrise of the following day.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.240
You must...

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.880
You must reach it.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.520
We'll reach it.
You'll be with us.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.640
No.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.840
No, my...

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.760
...race is run.

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.840
Use your power wisely.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.440
Do not squander it.

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.640
I learned the power from you.
I won't forget.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:00.680
We'll bury him here.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.080
The Iron Desert's 1,000 leagues from here.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.600
Fire mares.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.840
Fire mares can travel
1,000 leagues in a day.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.320
There's time,
if we move quickly.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.440
That's it. Drive them back!

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.360
The grey is the leader!

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.040
Hold him!

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:05.800
Come on! Come on!

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.000
- Come on!

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.560
I've got you.

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.200
Gentle as a baby!

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.080
Torquil!

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:34.520
Saddle the others, quickly!
- Right!

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:48.400
Come on, hold still!
Stand still, you beast!

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.120
Take good care of him.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.080
- Why doesn't he come?
- It's his time to die.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.280
If he's going to die anyway,
why doesn't he come with us?

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:12.400
No.
He must stay here and accept his fate.

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:16.320
If he opposes it,
he'll bring great pain on himself.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.080
Steady! I must remain here.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.080
Is it time?

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.400
You've done enough, Rell.
Stay here.

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.000
Each to his fate.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.720
Each to his fate.

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:40.680
Rell, I'll ride with you.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.160
I have to stay here, my friend.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.680
We had no time.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.280
- Let's go.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:54.520
- Come on!

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.360
Hold on!

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.680
There it is!

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:40.080
Yeah, and only madmen would want
to get this close to it.

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:42.560
We're going to get a lot closer.

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.640
And quickly,
it's almost dawn.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.440
We must get inside
before the twin suns rise.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:38.840
Rhun, get back!

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.280
I was wrong.

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:56.000
The journey was worthwhile.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.400
Finish it-

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.320
- We'll have to rush them.
- No, wait!

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.160
We'll be picked off as soon as we move.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.440
Colwyn, look.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.640
Follow him!

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:48.360
Come on!

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.880
Kegan!
Mind the boy!

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.040
Wait...

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.160
Torquil!

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.760
Get your axe in the opening!

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.200
It's no use.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.680
This is my time.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.680
Torquil!

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.680
Keep moving!

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.840
Which way?

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.080
Look out!

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.000
Kegan!

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.720
- My travelling days are over, my friend.
- No, we'll get you out of here.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:34:59.240
No, no...

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.800
No, here's where I stay.

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.600
Tell Merith
I loved her.

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:19.760
Lead on.

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.480
I can't hold him!

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:49.960
Torquil!

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.520
Throw us a rope!

01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:02.880
Slayers!

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:04.560
I'm going down.

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:09.360
Go!

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.680
Get back!

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:14.680
- Come out!
- No, wait!

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.920
There is nothing we can do.
Get out!

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.520
From here, I must go on alone.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.320
Go where? There's no way in.

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.240
There is one way.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:26.800
Bardolph.

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:14.080
We must find the others, Ergo.

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:28.800
Torquil!

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:29.760
Bardolph!

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.040
Bardolph!

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.600
They've stopped.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:29.920
No! Bardolph, let it go!

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:34.200
Look out!

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:55.480
Torquil!

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.160
- Lyssa!
- Colwyn!

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.760
Not here, Colwyn. He's too powerful.

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.880
You must fight him away from the centre.

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:44.320
The Glaive is gone.
I have no way to fight him.

01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:52.240
Colwyn, it's not the Glaive, it's you.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.440
No, Lyssa, it's us.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.800
It's us he can't defeat.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.560
It will not return to me except from
the hand of the woman I choose as my wife.

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:05.320
I give it only to the man
whom I choose as my husband.

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:09.680
Take the fire from my hand.

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.440
We have to find the others. Come on!

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.160
I won't leave you, Ergo.

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:19.760
Colwyn!

01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.160
- Bardolph?
- Look, over here!

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.400
That's Ergo. He may still be alive.

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.960
Let's get out of here.

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.720
He risked his life to save us.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:43.160
We can't leave him here if
there's even a chance he's still alive.

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:12.000
Come on, we're getting out of here.
Come on, come on.

01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.880
Stand back!

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:05.280
Oswyn.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.360
Help them down.

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:48.200
Ergo! Ergo!

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:50.560
He'll be all right.

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:54.120
- You are his queen?
- Yes.

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.240
- Then we've won.
- Yes.

01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:00.080
Oh, boy! I should have stuck to puppies!

01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.160
I think...

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.960
...it's time we unlock those manacles.

01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:12.440
Well...

01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:18.280
...I thought I'd keep them
as a memento of our journey.

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.160
Well,
the key's yours.

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:24.320
Only the king and his lord marshal
carry this key.

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:26.080
That's right.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:37.600
A girl of ancient name shall become queen.

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:42.600
She shall choose a king,
and together they shall rule our world...

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:46.000
...and their son shall rule the galaxy.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.160
