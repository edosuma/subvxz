WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:07.218
Captain's log, star date 41309.5.

00:07.385 --> 00:09.598
We are orbiting Persephone V,

00:09.808 --> 00:13.024
where I have been sent to confer
with Admiral Mark Jameson

00:13.191 --> 00:15.990
in regard to
an extraordinary situation.

00:16.157 --> 00:20.542
Starfleet received this subspace
transmission two days ago, Admiral.

00:20.709 --> 00:23.424
- Let's see it, Captain.
- On viewer.

00:28.561 --> 00:31.444
I am Karnas, Governor of Mordan IV.

00:31.611 --> 00:33.532
A dissident group of terrorists

00:33.699 --> 00:37.751
have taken Federation Ambassador
Hawkins and his staff hostage.

00:37.918 --> 00:40.173
They will not discuss terms
with me.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.640
This is a crisis I cannot resolve.

00:43.807 --> 00:47.315
The terrorists are demanding
a Federation negotiator.

00:47.483 --> 00:49.863
I feel there is only one negotiator

00:50.030 --> 00:52.995
with the skills
to resolve the situation.

00:53.163 --> 00:58.134
The lives of the hostages depends on
Starfleet bringing this man here.

00:59.136 --> 01:03.354
Cmdr Mark Jameson.
Admiral Jameson.

01:03.521 --> 01:07.239
The terrorists have given you
six Earth days to deliver him,

01:07.406 --> 01:10.831
or the hostages will die.

01:11.916 --> 01:15.300
Starfleet cannot understand
why this crisis has developed.

01:15.467 --> 01:18.850
Mordan IV has finally gained peace
after decades of civil war.

01:19.602 --> 01:23.152
- 40 years of civil war, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

01:23.612 --> 01:27.413
Karnas was largely responsible for
the planet's unification and peace.

01:27.580 --> 01:32.216
Why should he now be unable
to deal with this rebellious faction?

01:32.675 --> 01:38.397
45 years ago I negotiated a hostage
situation on Mordan, Captain.

01:38.564 --> 01:43.201
Karnas was a young man then,...
but so was l.

01:43.368 --> 01:46.668
He seems to feel
that I can handle things again.

01:46.835 --> 01:50.468
I'm to take you to Mordan IV
as soon as you're ready, Admiral.

01:51.388 --> 01:55.481
My wife and I will beam aboard
at 1500 hours, Captain.

01:55.982 --> 01:58.655
- Acknowledge.
- Received and acknowledged, sir.

01:58.780 --> 01:59.616
Picard out.

02:00.368 --> 02:01.955
Nearly 1500 now, sir.

02:03.792 --> 02:07.343
Well, Number One, let's go
and welcome the Admiral aboard.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.954 --> 02:24.008
Welcome aboard, Admiral. This is
my Executive Officer, Cmdr Riker.

02:24.176 --> 02:25.971
My pleasure, sir. Ma'am.

02:26.681 --> 02:28.268
My wife, Anne.

02:29.063 --> 02:33.782
Captain, there are certain details
of this mission you should understand

02:33.950 --> 02:34.993
before we begin.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.792
- Yes, sir.
- I am not just an adviser.

02:38.418 --> 02:39.964
On any assignment I accompany,

02:40.130 --> 02:43.264
Starfleet has designated me
Senior Mission Officer.

02:43.722 --> 02:47.022
I control the away team and all
its actions. Is that understood?

02:48.150 --> 02:53.329
Of course, Captain, you command
the ship, but the mission is mine.

02:53.496 --> 02:56.044
I trust you are in full agreement?

02:58.551 --> 03:00.973
Yes, sir. Of course.

03:21.649 --> 03:24.739
Space, the final frontier.

03:26.452 --> 03:30.378
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:30.544 --> 03:34.638
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

03:36.476 --> 03:40.151
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

03:41.070 --> 03:44.746
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.912
Message coming in from Mordan, sir.

04:58.957 --> 05:01.170
Put it on the screen, Mr. Data.

05:02.547 --> 05:06.848
Mordan IV to Enterprise. This is
Karnas. I will speak to the Captain.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.480
I am Capt Picard,
commanding the Enterprise.

05:10.646 --> 05:12.817
Is Admiral Jameson on board?

05:13.904 --> 05:15.991
He's here, beside my First Officer.

05:16.158 --> 05:17.620
Do you wish to speak to him now?

05:19.248 --> 05:22.671
So, Jameson,
I see time has not been kind.

05:23.214 --> 05:25.677
It seldom is, Karnas.

05:25.844 --> 05:28.767
But we could save a good deal of it,

05:28.934 --> 05:31.397
if you'll outline
the terrorists' demands.

05:31.564 --> 05:34.905
They insist all discussions
will take place here on Mordan.

05:35.072 --> 05:39.121
They refuse to speak to me,
only to a Federation mediator.

05:39.288 --> 05:41.836
They say
they will brook no excuses.

05:42.002 --> 05:48.474
If there are any offered, the
hostages will die... unpleasantly.

05:48.642 --> 05:51.481
I believe them.
So should you, Admiral.

05:53.067 --> 05:57.952
Tell them... I accept the conditions
of negotiation.

05:58.745 --> 06:00.583
I will do so immediately.

06:03.338 --> 06:06.386
He doesn't seem to know much
about the situation.

06:06.761 --> 06:08.348
Wrong, Number One.

06:09.475 --> 06:14.695
He told me that the terrorists are
desperate enough to kill if crossed.

06:15.863 --> 06:20.332
They are willing to talk,
one on one, but not to him.

06:20.999 --> 06:22.168
Counsellor?

06:22.336 --> 06:25.842
From his body language,
as well as his words and tone,

06:26.176 --> 06:29.182
I'd judge that
what Karnas said was honest.

06:30.393 --> 06:32.857
But I sensed a holding back.

06:33.483 --> 06:37.115
Perhaps he knows more about them
than he's prepared to admit.

06:37.282 --> 06:42.334
Possible, but I suspect
it's closer to the mark if we said

06:42.501 --> 06:47.762
he doesn't want to admit failure
of his own efforts to negotiate.

06:47.929 --> 06:51.103
- He is a proud man.
- That could be.

06:51.270 --> 06:55.695
Karnas has established himself
as a powerful man on Mordan.

06:55.862 --> 06:59.578
Suddenly, in this situation,
his power is useless.

06:59.744 --> 07:03.628
Sickbay to bridge.
I'm ready for Admiral Jameson now.

07:03.795 --> 07:05.423
In a few moments, Doctor.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.345
Ready for what, Captain?

07:08.513 --> 07:12.437
It's just a routine medical checkup.
Ship's regulations.

07:21.623 --> 07:26.007
I don't understand how Karnas knew
that you were still... available.

07:26.174 --> 07:29.890
- Still alive, you mean?
- You could've been dead.

07:30.308 --> 07:32.729
Quite right, Commander, but I am not,

07:32.896 --> 07:35.943
and I imagine Ambassador Hawkins
has told him that.

07:36.110 --> 07:39.994
I briefed the Ambassador about
Mordan before he took up residence.

07:40.996 --> 07:44.043
Karnas has a problem
he thinks you can resolve.

07:44.211 --> 07:49.096
What do the terrorists need that
Karnas can't, or won't, give them?

07:49.471 --> 07:51.434
Mordan's had peace for five years.

07:51.893 --> 07:53.982
They're finally at
a state of productivity

07:54.147 --> 07:57.947
which satisfies their planetary
needs, but no more than that.

07:58.114 --> 08:01.706
Perhaps the dissidents feel
the Federation could provide more.

08:02.038 --> 08:05.546
I have negotiated many treaties
on many planets.

08:06.256 --> 08:10.724
Peace, or the appearance of it,
is often a prelude to war.

08:11.307 --> 08:15.775
Admiral, are you suggesting
the terrorists want arms and weapons?

08:15.942 --> 08:21.412
They may. I am suggesting that Karnas
is the last man to give them weapons.

08:21.579 --> 08:26.464
I see. You believe that Karnas
would not negotiate on that point,

08:26.630 --> 08:30.473
and so the terrorists demanded
an outside negotiator.

08:30.638 --> 08:34.355
I know Karnas. He is a warrior.
He lives for challenge.

08:34.520 --> 08:38.822
These people have insulted his honour
by taking the embassy staff hostage.

08:39.405 --> 08:44.751
I'll negotiate, but I'll have to be
very careful in dealing with Karnas.

08:44.918 --> 08:47.340
He'll want revenge for that insult.

08:58.655 --> 09:04.624
Well, it's about time.
Couldn't get away from the bridge?

09:04.792 --> 09:08.299
Didn't want to.
Feels good to be on one again.

09:10.429 --> 09:13.685
I'm glad, Mark.
You want me to help you up?

09:24.959 --> 09:26.962
You're stronger today.

09:28.298 --> 09:30.303
I'm fine. I feel like a kid again.

09:32.725 --> 09:35.481
This ship is magnificent.

09:35.647 --> 09:38.110
It even has family quarters.

09:38.694 --> 09:42.285
Pity we didn't have them
20, 30 years ago.

09:42.453 --> 09:46.335
We could have been together
almost all of your career.

09:52.264 --> 09:55.729
- Mark? I'll get sickbay.
- No.

09:57.107 --> 09:59.570
There's no need.
It's... happened before.

10:01.699 --> 10:04.664
When? You haven't said anything.

10:04.831 --> 10:07.671
It'll pass. Just give me a moment.

10:09.925 --> 10:12.931
See, I'm... better. It's going away.

10:14.977 --> 10:17.774
What is it? Did the doctors know?

10:17.941 --> 10:23.452
Just body changes. Last checkup
they said I'd have to expect it.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.922
You're sure? Don't lie to me.

10:29.924 --> 10:31.302
I'm sure.

10:37.565 --> 10:41.239
All the medical information the
Admiral provided is satisfactory.

10:41.406 --> 10:44.078
- Excellent, Doctor.
- Except for one thing.

10:44.747 --> 10:48.754
The test results he gave aren't
two days old, they're two months old.

10:49.339 --> 10:53.556
The medical records coder includes
the date within the file number.

10:53.723 --> 10:56.020
He lied to me and I don't know why.

10:57.898 --> 11:01.614
He is 85 years old.
For some, memory starts to fail.

11:01.781 --> 11:06.916
He suffers from Iverson's disease.
That affects the body, not the mind.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.339
No, I have a gut feeling
he's hiding something.

11:10.632 --> 11:13.346
That is an observation
I would expect from Troi.

11:17.396 --> 11:18.440
Doctor...

11:21.990 --> 11:24.160
I do respect your opinion,...

11:24.954 --> 11:28.586
..and I'll want you on the bridge
for a few days.

11:28.752 --> 11:32.176
The Admiral must remain in the best
of health for these negotiations,

11:33.178 --> 11:35.350
and he might require your services.

11:42.156 --> 11:44.452
Admiral, we're approaching
the Idini star cluster.

11:44.619 --> 11:48.251
Would you like to take the conn
as we make transit?

11:48.418 --> 11:51.257
Thank you, Captain. I would.

12:28.207 --> 12:31.966
Well, Admiral, quite a
little surprise you've pulled on us.

12:33.092 --> 12:34.680
Yes, quite.

12:35.598 --> 12:37.018
Neglected to mention...

12:38.019 --> 12:42.111
I began some new therapy before
l... left. Seems to be working.

12:42.946 --> 12:47.121
I haven't felt this good
since the last time I was in space.

12:47.289 --> 12:54.052
All I needed to get me up was the
thought of commanding a ship again.

12:54.218 --> 12:56.724
Admiral,
you only have the conn temporarily.

12:57.392 --> 13:00.065
A figure of speech. She's your ship.

13:00.190 --> 13:03.864
I'll just keep an eye on her
for a while.

13:17.433 --> 13:20.105
The Admiral displayed
a remarkable improvement.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.612
No one recovers
from Iverson’s disease.

13:23.780 --> 13:26.869
There's no cure,
and it's never gone into remission.

13:27.036 --> 13:30.376
I know of no therapy
that would produce such results.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.923
- How do you account for it?
- I can't.

13:33.090 --> 13:36.931
The Admiral has been confined
to his chair for four years now

13:37.141 --> 13:38.727
because of Iverson’s.

13:38.893 --> 13:42.736
By all the medical facts we know,
he should never have walked again.

13:43.528 --> 13:46.910
- Look into it, Doctor, thoroughly.
- Yes, sir.

13:47.996 --> 13:51.169
The terrorists have given you
six Earth days to deliver him,...

13:51.879 --> 13:54.926
..or the hostages will die.

13:58.851 --> 14:02.734
I don't know how much more
you think you can get from that tape.

14:06.075 --> 14:08.747
- My God! What's happened?
- It's the new therapy I'm taking.

14:08.914 --> 14:11.126
It's... working, Annie.

14:12.170 --> 14:13.297
Darling!

14:21.189 --> 14:25.154
I told you I just needed
to get back in space again.

14:26.742 --> 14:31.418
- You really are looking much better.
- It's the new treatment.

14:31.585 --> 14:34.550
No,... come here.

14:35.134 --> 14:37.138
I hope you're heading
for the bedroom.

14:37.305 --> 14:38.766
You stop it.

14:40.770 --> 14:45.363
Darling, you look like you looked
20 years ago.

14:46.072 --> 14:47.617
You flatter me.

14:47.785 --> 14:50.583
Now, you tell me
what the hell is going on.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.171
I don't know.

14:56.260 --> 14:59.726
Sickbay, medical emergency
in the Admiral's quarters.

15:05.028 --> 15:08.494
I found chemical substances
in his blood and tissue samples,

15:08.660 --> 15:11.374
but none of them
are in our pharmacopoeia.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.589
I'm still working on alien references
to such substances.

15:14.756 --> 15:19.391
But he's certainly ingested something
that's strongly affecting his body.

15:19.557 --> 15:20.392
Specifics, Doctor.

15:20.559 --> 15:24.819
I can't give specifics
until I do a lot more tests.

15:24.985 --> 15:28.952
- What do you have?
- His red cell count's running riot.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.875
The cellular structure of his body
is changing,

15:32.042 --> 15:35.131
but we don't know
what it's changing to.

15:35.298 --> 15:36.634
His DNA is skewed.

15:36.802 --> 15:40.267
Don't ask me how,
but he even looks younger.

15:40.642 --> 15:45.068
And, Captain, there are absolutely
no traces of Iverson’s disease.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.407
You said there was no cure.

15:47.574 --> 15:49.494
None that we know of.

15:50.246 --> 15:53.711
Whatever these substances are doing,
at least they've done that.

15:53.878 --> 15:58.388
But how or why?
It's too early to say.

15:59.807 --> 16:04.232
Get me some answers, Doctor.
As soon as possible.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.445
Yes, sir.

16:13.210 --> 16:13.878
Captain.

16:14.045 --> 16:18.136
Mrs. Jameson, I have to ask
the Admiral some questions.

16:18.595 --> 16:20.182
Ask away.

16:23.773 --> 16:26.069
There's nothing to hide now.

16:30.327 --> 16:35.295
Sir, in addition to your rank, you
are particularly valuable just now.

16:35.922 --> 16:38.260
Starfleet has a right
to some answers.

16:38.886 --> 16:44.231
I've planned this for a long time,
ever since I learned I had Iverson’s.

16:44.398 --> 16:48.573
- Since it put me in that chair.
- What did you do?

16:49.116 --> 16:53.332
There's a planet
in the Cerebus system: Cerebus II.

16:53.499 --> 16:56.590
They have a process
that rejuvenates the body,

16:56.756 --> 16:58.426
gives you your youth back.

16:58.594 --> 17:00.849
I've heard that story. It's a myth.

17:01.015 --> 17:04.439
It's true, Picard. I'm living proof.

17:05.107 --> 17:11.244
It's dangerous. The mortality
rate is high, and it's very painful.

17:11.411 --> 17:15.462
Aliens are seldom allowed to obtain
the process, but I managed it.

17:15.628 --> 17:19.011
I negotiated a treaty
for Cerebus Il some years ago,

17:19.178 --> 17:23.560
and they felt obligated
to honour my request for the process.

17:23.728 --> 17:26.777
Obviously it works rapidly,
but how does it work?

17:26.944 --> 17:28.613
The herb and drug combinations

17:28.781 --> 17:32.746
are self-administered slowly
over a period of two years.

17:33.414 --> 17:37.506
Every response is different
depending on a being's DNA.

17:37.673 --> 17:43.394
I got enough for both of us, but I
had to test it. I couldn't risk you.

17:43.811 --> 17:48.362
If I died, well, I was half a man,
so what did it matter?

17:49.030 --> 17:53.247
- It would matter to me.
- I was starting to change.

17:53.414 --> 17:57.673
It... was almost undetectable,
but the improvement was there.

17:57.840 --> 18:02.516
Then when this hostage crisis came
up, I knew I had to be at my peak.

18:03.018 --> 18:06.733
I couldn't wait
for the drug to work naturally...

18:06.899 --> 18:09.864
- So you took the whole dose?
- Both of them.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.620
And look at me, Annie.

18:12.787 --> 18:16.628
I'm strong. I'm alert. Fit.
I'm fitter than you are, Picard.

18:16.794 --> 18:18.716
I'm getting younger.

18:26.064 --> 18:30.991
The only question I have is why
you thought it necessary to be young

18:31.158 --> 18:33.120
to negotiate the hostages' release.

18:33.287 --> 18:35.959
Even willing
to put your life at risk for it.

18:42.306 --> 18:45.561
I'll be on the bridge, Admiral,
if you want to talk further.

18:54.873 --> 18:57.796
Why didn't you tell me, Mark?

18:57.963 --> 19:00.843
We've always been honest
with each other until now.

19:01.761 --> 19:03.307
I did it for us.

19:05.437 --> 19:08.109
I'm sure you believed that,

19:08.234 --> 19:12.701
until you had a chance to lead
a mission, and to command again.

19:12.868 --> 19:17.627
Then you just upended the bottle,
or whatever it was,

19:17.794 --> 19:19.757
and damn everything.

19:19.923 --> 19:22.930
Did you think about me at all?

19:23.097 --> 19:26.979
I obtained enough of the dosage
for both of us.

19:27.147 --> 19:29.903
But you never asked if I wanted it.

19:30.070 --> 19:31.865
It's just like you

19:32.032 --> 19:35.706
to assume that what you felt
was right was the answer.

19:35.873 --> 19:38.169
It was the right answer for me.

19:38.337 --> 19:40.925
It was killing you,
caring for an invalid.

19:41.134 --> 19:44.767
What good was l?
We can be together again.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.186
Let me go.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.775
I can get you
another supply of the drug.

20:11.822 --> 20:18.837
Cmdr Data, I wish to open
a communication frequency to Karnas.

20:19.003 --> 20:21.967
- Aye, sir.
- One moment.

20:22.134 --> 20:26.603
Admiral, this is Picard. May I know
the reason for this communication?

20:26.769 --> 20:32.113
Karnas must have tried to negotiate
before he was forced to call on me.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.536
I want all the information
he has access to.

20:35.704 --> 20:40.379
You said Karnas was proud, and
probably sensitive to his failure.

20:40.547 --> 20:42.467
Is it wise to press him?

20:42.635 --> 20:44.597
I am the negotiator.

20:44.765 --> 20:49.357
Karnas will have to cooperate
with me, and damn his sensitivities.

20:49.524 --> 20:52.363
Then may I suggest a secured channel,
Admiral?

20:52.947 --> 20:56.914
A sensible precaution, Picard.
Make it so.

20:58.208 --> 21:00.421
- Make it so.
- Aye, sir.

21:01.256 --> 21:03.845
Frequency open and secured.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.979
- Karnas.
- What is it, Admiral?

21:08.146 --> 21:12.822
We're on a secured channel, Karnas.
You can talk freely.

21:12.989 --> 21:15.953
Who's behind this thing?
You said dissidents.

21:16.120 --> 21:21.840
Yes, political opponents who feel
the Federation will disavow me

21:22.007 --> 21:24.888
if they stir up enough trouble here.

21:25.305 --> 21:27.768
Then who is it? Ardan? Gilnor?

21:27.935 --> 21:31.736
They're dead, Jameson.
A long time now.

21:31.902 --> 21:34.866
A long time
I thought you were dead, too.

21:35.534 --> 21:38.207
I almost died
a few times on missions,

21:38.332 --> 21:40.336
but I always survived somehow.

21:40.503 --> 21:45.764
Yes. Now you're returning to Mordan
to negotiate for hostages again.

21:46.432 --> 21:50.481
It's almost as though the 45 years
in between never happened.

21:54.031 --> 21:56.118
You've never forgiven me.

21:56.285 --> 21:59.626
Of course I have. It was years ago.

22:01.922 --> 22:04.761
There are no dissidents, are there?

22:04.928 --> 22:08.102
No terrorists.
You have the hostages.

22:08.643 --> 22:13.821
And if I have... ?
You're coming to Mordan,

22:13.988 --> 22:16.660
and you're going to negotiate
for their lives.

22:16.827 --> 22:20.126
And I'm going to ask
a very, very high price.

22:20.293 --> 22:24.551
- What if I refuse?
- Then the hostages will die.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.473
You've seen
how my executioners work.

22:27.641 --> 22:31.941
They are still as efficient as they
were, perhaps even more skilled now.

22:33.653 --> 22:38.998
You'll come,... even if you don't
have much honour left.

22:50.395 --> 22:55.907
Conn, are we still on schedule
to arrive at Mordan in 38 hours?

22:56.074 --> 22:58.245
Aye, sir, we're at warp four.

22:58.411 --> 23:03.965
I want to jump to warp eight, so we
arrive ahead of our announced ETA.

23:04.132 --> 23:08.474
It'll throw Karnas off balance, and
we can catch him before he's ready.

23:08.641 --> 23:10.186
Ready for what exactly?

23:10.354 --> 23:15.281
I believe Karnas has the hostages
and there never were any dissidents.

23:15.447 --> 23:17.743
Why have you come to that conclusion?

23:17.910 --> 23:19.664
I'm not at liberty to say,

23:19.831 --> 23:23.088
but negotiations
are no longer the answer.

23:23.255 --> 23:27.680
Isn't the most important thing
the hostages' lives?

23:27.848 --> 23:29.350
And you agree, Riker?

23:29.517 --> 23:31.313
- I do.
- Good.

23:31.480 --> 23:35.487
Because I plan to lead the away team
on an armed mission

23:35.655 --> 23:37.659
to get them out of there.

23:43.755 --> 23:48.181
Cmdr Data, bring up the plans I
requested on the view screen, please.

23:48.348 --> 23:49.183
Aye, sir.

23:49.350 --> 23:53.734
Most of Mordan's principal city
was devastated during the war.

23:54.234 --> 23:57.741
What was left consisted largely
of a network of underground tunnels.

23:57.908 --> 24:04.422
A rats' maze. When they rebuilt the
city, they built over the tunnels.

24:05.383 --> 24:06.217
I have it, sir.

24:12.063 --> 24:15.152
Sir, where do these tunnels
come into the picture?

24:15.319 --> 24:17.783
It's where Karnas
held his hostages before,

24:17.950 --> 24:21.456
and where I believe he has them now.

24:21.623 --> 24:23.503
Wouldn't that be too obvious?

24:23.670 --> 24:26.884
Karnas is a dogged strategist,
not a brilliant one.

24:27.051 --> 24:29.389
He sticks to what works.

24:29.557 --> 24:33.481
He will kill the hostages
if we do not get them out.

24:33.649 --> 24:36.863
Therefore this armed raid
is the only option?

24:37.030 --> 24:38.283
You don't agree?

24:38.450 --> 24:40.370
With respect, I would point out

24:40.537 --> 24:43.251
that no one else
has heard Karnas's demands.

24:43.418 --> 24:47.134
The Federation might view them
differently if they knew of them.

24:47.301 --> 24:52.645
Starfleet has given me command
of the away team, Picard,

24:52.812 --> 24:56.236
and I intend to use them
as I see fit.

24:59.952 --> 25:03.709
Our anniversary is next week.
Our 50th.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.718
In his heart, he's still
the same man you married.

25:08.219 --> 25:09.304
That's true.

25:09.472 --> 25:13.479
He still cares for you, despite
the physical changes he's undergoing.

25:14.273 --> 25:19.367
But he's getting younger, and I'm...
Well, look at me.

25:20.494 --> 25:22.540
Why did he do this?

25:22.916 --> 25:25.713
Because there are lives at stake,
Mrs. Jameson.

25:25.880 --> 25:29.470
Well, what about our lives,
his and mine?

25:29.638 --> 25:34.439
I was looking forward to time
together, finally. Our retirement.

25:34.940 --> 25:39.658
Now he's young again,
and has his life to live over.

25:42.204 --> 25:46.046
- Doctor, she has to know.
- Know what?

25:51.182 --> 25:53.937
- Your husband...
- What is it?

25:54.104 --> 25:56.401
He's not stabilizing.

25:56.568 --> 25:59.282
He may not have
that life to live over.

26:20.242 --> 26:22.663
We'll be at Mordan in three hours.

26:26.128 --> 26:28.216
I couldn't sleep, either.

26:29.301 --> 26:31.305
I never could before a mission.

26:32.599 --> 26:37.735
I always wound up in the observation
lounge, staring out, thinking.

26:38.445 --> 26:40.783
Perhaps in this case,... rethinking.

26:54.562 --> 26:59.237
Why is this so important? Why did you
risk your life to lead it?

26:59.405 --> 27:01.910
I want to save lives, Captain.

27:02.535 --> 27:06.168
Noble sentiments,
but that's too easy an answer.

27:06.336 --> 27:07.546
You've been here before.

27:07.714 --> 27:11.011
You negotiated a release
of the hostages with Karnas before.

27:11.763 --> 27:14.770
Why is it now your answer
is an armed raid?

27:15.522 --> 27:18.193
It's my away team
you're sending in there.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.994
There's something you're not saying.
I have a right to know.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.127
Do you know the background?

27:29.466 --> 27:31.136
The Mordanites
had some sophistication,

27:31.302 --> 27:35.228
but were still ruled
by family tribal units.

27:36.730 --> 27:41.491
Karnas's father was the ruling
chief of one of the families.

27:41.657 --> 27:44.204
Another tribe had him assassinated.

27:45.541 --> 27:49.966
Karnas seized the passengers of
a star liner and held them hostage,

27:50.133 --> 27:52.847
demanding that Starfleet
provide him with weapons

27:53.014 --> 27:55.226
that would enable him
to defeat his rivals.

27:56.605 --> 27:58.400
That's the official record.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.654
Officially,

28:02.199 --> 28:06.709
the story is that after
two other mediators were murdered,

28:08.630 --> 28:14.057
I went in and negotiated with
Karnas to bring out the hostages.

28:15.268 --> 28:17.397
Are you saying that's not the truth?

28:17.564 --> 28:23.117
It wasn't my... golden oratory
that saved them, Captain.

28:25.539 --> 28:28.254
I gave Karnas the weapons he wanted.

28:30.299 --> 28:31.718
You did what?

28:31.885 --> 28:34.683
I gave the same weapons
to his rivals.

28:34.849 --> 28:37.145
My interpretation
of the Prime Directive.

28:37.313 --> 28:41.822
Let them solve their problems
with those arms on an equal basis.

28:46.081 --> 28:50.339
And that decision plunged them
into 40 years of civil war.

28:50.506 --> 28:55.559
I didn't know that would happen.
I thought it'd be over in a year.

28:55.726 --> 28:58.648
How would I know
it would take four decades?

28:59.442 --> 29:05.454
But l... falsified the records
to Starfleet.

29:06.331 --> 29:09.420
I lived with that on my soul.

29:09.588 --> 29:11.257
63 people came away safe,

29:11.424 --> 29:15.266
but millions died on Mordan
because I delivered those weapons.

29:17.604 --> 29:21.027
Karnas could have worked for peace
instead of fighting.

29:21.194 --> 29:25.953
- It's not all on your head.
- But I started it. I lit the match.

29:26.120 --> 29:30.171
Now finally I can vindicate myself,
if only in a small way.

29:30.338 --> 29:35.014
I came to negotiate,
but that isn't what Karnas wants.

29:35.181 --> 29:40.859
Revenge. That's why he demanded you
when he knew you were still alive.

29:41.402 --> 29:43.783
I'm not going to give it to him.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.997
I will do
what I should have done last time.

29:47.331 --> 29:51.799
We're taking the hostages out
by force, if necessary. No deals.

29:59.231 --> 30:02.154
- Prepare to energize, Chief.
- Belay that.

30:02.319 --> 30:04.992
Admiral, your proper place
is on the bridge.

30:05.159 --> 30:07.664
I will remind you one more time,
Picard.

30:08.458 --> 30:12.049
I am the Senior Mission Commander
and I am leading this team.

30:13.008 --> 30:14.763
Sir?

30:14.929 --> 30:18.186
The Admiral is correct, Number One.
He has that right.

30:18.979 --> 30:23.529
But I am the Captain of this ship,
and I have a right to accompany him.

30:27.915 --> 30:32.005
Riker, you're in command
of the Enterprise. Energize.

30:58.727 --> 31:00.020
Yes. Perfect.

31:00.188 --> 31:03.821
We are in the M-4 tunnel, directly
under the Governor's residence.

31:03.988 --> 31:08.706
M-4 is a subsidiary tunnel, but
it links with several main ones.

31:08.873 --> 31:12.546
Sorry, sir. That does not correspond
with the information in my tricoder.

31:12.714 --> 31:16.931
It is incorrect. I know the tunnels
like the back of my hand.

31:17.098 --> 31:19.394
Keep scanning
for signs of human life forms.

31:19.561 --> 31:23.861
Karnas held the hostages in these
tunnels before. He'll do it again.

31:33.799 --> 31:38.725
Captain, the Admiral
is definitely incorrect.

31:38.892 --> 31:43.068
Our tunnel schematics show this
was sealed off two years ago.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.487
No doubt you're right.

31:44.654 --> 31:49.998
But 45 years ago, I'm sure it joined
the tunnels the Admiral remembers.

31:58.014 --> 31:59.601
Damn.

32:01.773 --> 32:06.741
This is steel plast, sir.
Fairly recent installation.

32:06.908 --> 32:10.373
This is the most direct route.
Set phasers to cut through it.

32:36.009 --> 32:39.808
If you have the coordinates where the
hostages are, we could beam there.

32:40.602 --> 32:42.731
Karnas may not have them together.

32:42.898 --> 32:46.989
There's no substitute, Lieutenant,
for a personal reconnoiter.

32:59.390 --> 33:02.145
Admiral, there's
an infrared light signal ahead.

33:02.312 --> 33:06.738
Steady beam, across the tunnel,
chest-high. Another at waist level.

33:07.197 --> 33:09.869
- An alarm trigger or...
- Reset phasers to stun.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.041
Take cover!

33:23.188 --> 33:23.940
Look out!

33:36.089 --> 33:37.551
Their phasers are set on kill.

33:37.719 --> 33:40.642
Thank you, Mr. Data.
I have heard the sound before.

33:58.135 --> 34:00.682
- Is he hit?
- No sign of a wound.

34:03.939 --> 34:06.319
Enterprise, this is Picard.
Six to beam up, now!

34:22.393 --> 34:23.145
The Admiral?

34:23.312 --> 34:26.443
Sickbay. "Not good"
is a galactic understatement.

34:26.610 --> 34:29.658
Sir? Karnas again. On screen.

34:30.827 --> 34:35.337
There has been an armed intrusion
in the tunnels beneath the city.

34:35.503 --> 34:39.177
That smells of Jameson.
Where is he?

34:40.723 --> 34:45.482
This is Picard. I'm sorry to inform
you, the Admiral is critically ill.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.237
That is not my concern.

34:48.405 --> 34:52.705
Sick or well, you have ten minutes
to beam him down.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.963
- Sickbay to bridge.
- Picard.

34:57.130 --> 35:00.011
Dr. Crusher requests your presence
immediately, sir.

35:00.888 --> 35:02.475
I'm on my way.

35:06.108 --> 35:07.276
Sickbay.

35:09.072 --> 35:10.909
What is it, Doctor?

35:11.828 --> 35:14.208
I think you'd better see
for yourself.

35:28.445 --> 35:32.161
- I have to get to Karnas.
- I can't allow it.

35:32.704 --> 35:37.714
It's my last option. The raid failed.
All I have to bargain with is myself.

35:38.590 --> 35:41.012
- Bridge to Picard.
- Picard here.

35:41.179 --> 35:42.891
A new message from Karnas, sir.

35:43.350 --> 35:46.774
We deliver Jameson in five minutes,
or a hostage dies.

35:46.940 --> 35:50.073
15 minutes after that, another.

35:50.239 --> 35:54.498
He promises the method of execution
will be most painful.

35:55.166 --> 36:00.218
Let me go. If I give myself over
to him, he'll let the hostages go.

36:00.385 --> 36:02.389
It's me he wants.

36:02.807 --> 36:04.727
It means
almost certain death for you.

36:05.979 --> 36:09.028
My life for how many hostages? 20?

36:10.406 --> 36:11.951
Let me go.

36:19.466 --> 36:22.806
Inform Karnas we'll be beaming down
in under five minutes.

36:23.140 --> 36:26.981
- Did you say "we", sir?
- You have your orders.

36:28.443 --> 36:30.446
Aye, sir.

36:41.720 --> 36:45.478
Who are you? I want Jameson.

36:46.730 --> 36:51.238
Karnas,...
this is Admiral Mark Jameson.

36:59.171 --> 37:05.059
This... charade
will accomplish nothing, Picard.

37:05.226 --> 37:08.817
Beam down Jameson
and the hostages will be freed.

37:08.983 --> 37:13.075
Continue this and they will die.
And you with them.

37:13.243 --> 37:19.213
Peretor Karnas, you always were
stubborn. I thought you wanted me.

37:19.380 --> 37:22.678
I'm here. Release the hostages now.

37:22.845 --> 37:27.313
Peretor was my old title.
Why do you call me that?

37:27.480 --> 37:31.112
I warn you, Picard.
This trick is going on too far.

37:31.279 --> 37:34.744
He has been coached
for some devious reason.

37:35.537 --> 37:38.293
If this farce does not stop
immediately,

37:38.460 --> 37:41.926
you and the hostages
will be put to death.

37:43.137 --> 37:43.762
Doctor!

37:47.521 --> 37:50.109
I am waiting for an explanation,
Captain.

37:50.276 --> 37:52.322
He is the Admiral!

37:52.489 --> 37:56.330
He took an overdose
of an alien de-ageing drug.

37:56.496 --> 38:01.257
He... wanted to face you
with strength again, on even terms.

38:01.799 --> 38:06.726
- This is what the drug has done.
- This story is unbelievable!

38:06.893 --> 38:11.529
Jameson is a man
of more than 80 years, not this!

38:11.695 --> 38:15.035
I want that old man, Picard.

38:15.202 --> 38:19.169
I want to show him this world
he helped to make.

38:19.336 --> 38:24.846
The scars on old soldiers' bodies.
The graveyards of our young dead.

38:25.013 --> 38:28.229
The wasted cities
that we are still rebuilding.

38:29.983 --> 38:33.698
And all of it caused by him.

38:33.865 --> 38:38.792
It was you who demanded the weapons
to avenge your father's death.

38:38.959 --> 38:42.300
But Jameson didn't give weapons
to only us.

38:42.466 --> 38:45.890
If he had, we would have
quickly beaten our enemies

38:46.056 --> 38:48.729
and there would have been peace
long ago.

38:49.272 --> 38:52.445
I want him to pay for that, Picard.

38:55.200 --> 38:58.499
I think Mrs. Jameson
should beam down now.

38:59.417 --> 39:03.050
Enterprise, this is Picard. Have
Mrs. Jameson prepare to beam down.

39:03.217 --> 39:08.019
We have brought visual records we
made of the Admiral's deterioration.

39:08.186 --> 39:10.649
- Look at them.
- Don't waste my time.

39:10.815 --> 39:11.859
Just a few moments.

39:13.196 --> 39:16.495
- You saw the Admiral en route here?
- Yes.

39:16.662 --> 39:18.164
- And recognized him?
- Yes.

39:18.331 --> 39:19.708
Is this who you saw?

39:21.505 --> 39:25.220
- This is the man I want!
- He's here, Karnas. Look.

39:38.999 --> 39:41.754
Once he took the compound,
there was no way to stop it.

40:00.585 --> 40:03.048
You'll have to deal with me, Karnas.

40:03.214 --> 40:05.720
Whatever you wanted from Jameson
isn't possible now.

40:05.887 --> 40:09.686
And you wanted revenge.
You blamed your war on him.

40:10.062 --> 40:14.905
No doubt he had a lot to do with it,
but you used the weapons.

40:15.072 --> 40:19.413
You could've tried for negotiations
for peace on your planet long ago.

40:19.581 --> 40:21.126
Instead, you chose to fight.

40:21.293 --> 40:24.800
How many of those 40 years of war
are on your head?

40:24.966 --> 40:28.265
Jameson must pay.
I've sworn it to my people.

40:28.432 --> 40:33.860
45 years ago he made the wrong
decision. He wanted to right it,

40:34.821 --> 40:36.825
to atone for what he did.

40:37.660 --> 40:42.920
Now all he can do
is give himself up to you.

40:43.087 --> 40:45.300
He brought this retribution
on himself.

40:45.467 --> 40:47.263
No. I don't believe you.

40:47.431 --> 40:50.769
You're shielding Jameson on the ship.
This tale is to save his life.

40:52.314 --> 40:58.870
Peretor Karnas,... there were
only two of us in the meeting.

40:59.037 --> 41:01.584
You didn't even trust
your lieutenants there.

41:02.461 --> 41:08.056
You told me that old Peretor Sain had
ordered your father's assassination.

41:08.849 --> 41:12.648
You told me that you wanted arms
to destroy him.

41:12.815 --> 41:19.829
Peace... wasn't on your mind.
All you wanted was revenge.

41:19.996 --> 41:22.167
And I gave you the weapons
to do it.

41:24.047 --> 41:26.051
Jameson told you this.

41:27.929 --> 41:31.269
If it is you, show me the scar.

41:33.065 --> 41:38.075
There! The blood cut you gave me
to seal our bargain.

41:41.624 --> 41:43.837
It is you.

41:44.923 --> 41:49.223
Somehow... it is you.

41:57.281 --> 41:59.870
Then die by your own weapon!

42:04.796 --> 42:10.141
No. No, my revenge will be
in seeing you live like this.

42:19.409 --> 42:21.079
Such pain.

42:21.872 --> 42:26.591
His cells are being forced to go
younger. They can't take the stress.

42:26.758 --> 42:30.766
It's like they're imploding.
I can't give him anything to stop it.

42:30.933 --> 42:32.520
Can you ease the pain?

42:34.941 --> 42:37.364
Mark, can you hear me?

42:38.783 --> 42:40.117
Yes.

42:41.204 --> 42:43.416
I will always love you.

42:45.213 --> 42:47.968
Annie with the golden hair.

42:49.888 --> 42:53.729
Flatterer. It's grey now.

42:58.030 --> 43:00.326
I see only the gold.

43:19.114 --> 43:20.911
Rest, Jameson.

43:22.622 --> 43:28.635
Your long night,... and mine,...
are over.

43:32.684 --> 43:36.442
The hostages will be freed
immediately, Captain.

43:37.569 --> 43:42.162
I'm... prepared to be... cooperative.

43:51.222 --> 43:54.938
The hostages have been freed
by Karnas, unharmed.

43:55.106 --> 43:58.779
The body of Admiral Mark Jameson
has been buried on Mordan,

43:58.946 --> 44:02.830
at the request of his widow,
and by the permission of Karnas.

44:05.334 --> 44:09.342
The quest for youth, Number One...
So futile.

44:10.596 --> 44:13.183
Age and wisdom have their graces too.

44:13.809 --> 44:18.486
I wonder if one doesn't have to have
age and wisdom to appreciate that.

44:19.739 --> 44:22.201
I hope not, Number One.

44:22.995 --> 44:24.999
Mr. La Forge,
prepare to take us out of orbit.

44:25.500 --> 44:30.845
- Set course for Isis III.
- Aye, sir. Leaving orbit.
