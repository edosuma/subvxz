00:10.319 --> 00:14.260
New message. 9:03am.

00:14.284 --> 00:17.072
I won't have you talking to me
like that. Not in my own home.

00:17.096 --> 00:20.096
You come back now, say you're sorry,
 or don't come back at all!

00:21.640 --> 00:24.640
End of message.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.952
You've made your point, OK?

00:27.976 --> 00:30.320
Let's just put it behind us.

00:30.344 --> 00:33.344
We both said things we didn't mean.

00:34.444 --> 00:37.104
And me and your dad just want you
to come home now.

00:37.128 --> 00:40.128
End of message.

00:40.264 --> 00:43.264
Tonia, where are you?

00:43.528 --> 00:46.528
You're scaring us.
We just want to know you're safe.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.600
Yeah? Give us a call.
Will you do that?

00:52.040 --> 00:55.040
End of message.

00:56.328 --> 00:59.328
We want you home.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.424
We're both worried sick.

01:01.448 --> 01:03.536
Just come home.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.560
End of message.

01:08.808 --> 01:11.808
Darling, we want you to come home.

01:19.048 --> 01:22.048
We love you so much.

01:25.512 --> 01:28.512
Tonia, please come home, baby.

03:11.368 --> 03:14.368
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh!

03:14.824 --> 03:17.040
Argh!

03:17.064 --> 03:18.704
Got something for you.Ah!

03:18.728 --> 03:20.944
All the sentences you didn't like?

03:20.968 --> 03:22.352
There were a lot of them.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.376
Are you here to pick a prime
minister, or deal with your son?

03:26.664 --> 03:29.664
How is he?

03:32.360 --> 03:33.940
OK.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.964
Sorry.

03:37.032 --> 03:40.032
Morning.

04:12.744 --> 04:15.344
You wouldn't have a clue, would you,
 what it was like back then?

04:15.368 --> 04:17.392
What it meant to be a reporter?

04:17.416 --> 04:20.416
My parents were journalists.
They met on the news floor.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.664
When I was a little girl,
they'd bring me in

04:23.688 --> 04:26.688
to the old Fleet Street offices
of The Daily Telegraph.

04:27.656 --> 04:30.656
I knew straight away,
this is where I belong.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.264
Everyone smoked back then.

04:33.288 --> 04:36.288
Ashtrays and typewriters.

04:55.816 --> 04:58.816
Say something, someone.

05:01.256 --> 05:04.256
Say you're sad.

05:04.328 --> 05:07.328
Say it's for the best.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.400
Say it's wrong!

05:12.904 --> 05:15.904
In this room, not a word.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.896
Pfft!

05:18.920 --> 05:21.584
I'll say something.

05:21.608 --> 05:24.608
Maggie...I want you to stay.

05:25.512 --> 05:28.512
In here, you matter.
Out there, you won't.

05:30.376 --> 05:32.720
All you have to do, once in a while,
is toe the line.

05:32.744 --> 05:34.960
You don't want me to stay.

05:34.984 --> 05:37.984
You just don't want to tell
your father I'm gone. Hm!

05:39.848 --> 05:42.848
Maggie, please!

05:45.800 --> 05:48.144
You believed in this paper once.

05:48.168 --> 05:50.320
I believed in something.

05:50.344 --> 05:53.344
It just wasn't you.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.792
I held his hand.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.672
He would've recoiled, ordinarily,

06:42.696 --> 06:45.696
from any kind of intimacy.

06:47.176 --> 06:50.096
Doesn't seeing him like that
make you wonder

06:50.120 --> 06:52.592
whether it's time to move on
with your life?

06:52.616 --> 06:55.616
By move on, you mean remarry?

06:57.736 --> 07:00.736
What else?

07:02.408 --> 07:05.408
Alex?Yes?No, no, don't do that.

07:05.608 --> 07:08.608
Um...if you follow me,
let's go and...

07:09.004 --> 07:12.004
Come with me, I'll show you
what I want.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.480
We'll bring you more
on that rapidly-developing story

07:16.616 --> 07:18.000
just as soon as we have it.

07:18.024 --> 07:20.816
But now, with the Prime Minister
considering a date

07:20.840 --> 07:22.420
for the general election,

07:22.444 --> 07:25.444
we go live to our political editor,
who is at Westminster.

07:26.088 --> 07:29.088
We're hearing that
the PM spoke to his Cabinet...

07:29.164 --> 07:32.164
The Prime Minister has requested
that we enter through the back.

07:33.256 --> 07:35.472
But the opposition leader,
Angela Howard,

07:35.496 --> 07:38.496
says it's time the country
had a change, and...

07:47.400 --> 07:50.400
Thank you.

07:52.456 --> 07:55.456
Hello.Hello, sir. Follow me.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.976
Thank you.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.592
Prime Minister.Max.
How are you?Well.

08:04.616 --> 08:06.704
Prime Minister.

08:06.728 --> 08:08.944
I'm sorry for the wait.

08:08.968 --> 08:10.992
No, not at all.

08:11.016 --> 08:13.616
I'm curious, Prime Minister,
what...what is this?

08:13.640 --> 08:16.640
What are these? I haven't seen them
before. What are they?

08:16.712 --> 08:18.736
Shortbread.Short-bread?

08:18.760 --> 08:21.296
Scottish biscuits.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.984
Are they supposed to look this pale?

08:24.008 --> 08:27.008
That's the idea, yes.Yeah.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.232
They're baked at low temperature.

08:29.256 --> 08:32.256
Ah! Yeah, I've had fruit cake here.

08:33.288 --> 08:36.288
With three different
prime ministers.

08:37.895 --> 08:40.304
In the run-up to five
general elections.

08:40.328 --> 08:42.096
This will make six.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.120
I always thought fruit cake was such
 a quaint British tradition.

08:54.472 --> 08:56.304
Shall I call for some cake?

08:56.328 --> 08:59.328
No, no. That wasn't a request.
This is...

09:05.928 --> 09:08.928
Shortbread.

09:13.672 --> 09:16.672
So, my friend, give me a date.

09:27.944 --> 09:30.032
There's bread there, as well.

09:30.056 --> 09:33.056
There you go.

10:01.928 --> 10:04.336
Took me four years

10:04.360 --> 10:06.512
to get from there to here.

10:06.536 --> 10:08.624
I had a career,

10:08.648 --> 10:11.504
a house, a wife.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.528
Friends, golf clubs.

10:15.176 --> 10:17.328
Sorry.

10:17.352 --> 10:18.992
My fault.

10:19.016 --> 10:20.592
Most of it.

10:20.616 --> 10:23.616
Sorry anyway.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.480
What about you?

10:28.808 --> 10:30.384
Me?

10:30.408 --> 10:31.984
Why are you here?

10:32.008 --> 10:35.008
What have you been told?

10:55.816 --> 10:57.456
It's not my fault! He's...

10:57.480 --> 10:59.056
It doesn't matter whose fault it is!

10:59.080 --> 11:02.080
It doesn't matter whose
fault it is!It's not my fault!

11:37.544 --> 11:40.016
Tonia, where are you?
You're scaring us!

11:40.040 --> 11:41.808
We just want to know you're safe.

11:41.832 --> 11:44.832
Give us a call. Will you do that?

12:29.576 --> 12:32.576
Keep your desk tidy!

12:58.056 --> 13:00.336
Hey, my son!

13:00.360 --> 13:02.704
Come here, come here, come here.

13:02.728 --> 13:04.880
Look at you!

13:04.904 --> 13:06.736
You look good.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.760
Are you going to show me?
Sure. That's why we're here.

13:14.696 --> 13:17.616
Is something bothering you?

13:17.640 --> 13:19.792
Can I ask why?

13:19.816 --> 13:21.584
Sure. Why what?

13:21.608 --> 13:24.608
Why did you took Lauren to see
the Prime Minister?

13:24.872 --> 13:27.472
Oh, well, three of us
would have been too many.

13:27.496 --> 13:30.496
Main news floor.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.640
Hm.

13:39.848 --> 13:42.848
Wow! Changed a lot.

13:43.048 --> 13:46.048
Very...precise.

13:58.280 --> 14:01.280
OK, everyone, please, just pretend
I'm not here, all right?

14:03.464 --> 14:06.464
Just carry on with your work.
Do what you do.

14:19.848 --> 14:22.256
Hey, I'm Max.
Charlie.Charlie.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.280
You're not in trouble, sit down.
You're fine.

14:26.376 --> 14:28.016
So, this is your desk?

14:28.040 --> 14:31.040
Er...yes.
No, well, I've been moved here.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.240
Ah! OK.
So you're not a journalist?

14:35.400 --> 14:38.400
He's an intern.

14:38.664 --> 14:41.664
OK. So, the desk became free,
you're making good use of it, right?

14:42.504 --> 14:45.504
Yes, sir.That's good, that's good.
That's very good. Good.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.304
Whose desk was that?

15:04.328 --> 15:07.328
Maggie Barns.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.064
Where is she?

15:10.088 --> 15:11.856
She left.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.544
And he needed a desk, so...That's
not the reason he's sitting there.

15:14.568 --> 15:16.720
You didn't want me to ask about
Maggie.

15:16.744 --> 15:19.280
We're in the run-up
to a general election

15:19.304 --> 15:22.224
and now we have lost
our most trusted,

15:22.248 --> 15:25.248
experienced and popular
political correspondent!

15:26.024 --> 15:29.024
Well, she was disloyal.

15:33.448 --> 15:36.448
We are all capable of disloyalty

15:37.928 --> 15:40.928
if we're not managed properly.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.640
It's for you.

16:18.952 --> 16:21.952
Please, you'd be doing me a favour.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.992
How's that?

16:27.016 --> 16:29.424
If you accept it,
I'll have made a gift.

16:29.448 --> 16:32.448
But if I keep it, I'll have made
something completely useless.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.912
Well, if you put it like that,
you made a gift.

16:57.608 --> 16:59.696
Static.
Rolling when we get into it.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.744
We all right for sound? Great.

17:01.768 --> 17:04.560
OK, so first positions, please,
and then tracking

17:04.584 --> 17:07.584
when we get started. Hold on.

17:07.976 --> 17:09.551
Good afternoon, sir.

17:09.576 --> 17:12.496
Yeah, hello.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.992
This is our flagship
current affairs show?

17:15.016 --> 17:17.104
Yes. Yes, it is.OK.

17:17.127 --> 17:20.127
Our viewer expects the interviewee
to be under pressure.

17:21.352 --> 17:23.887
Yes.
Would you like to see the questions?

17:23.912 --> 17:26.912
No, it's not about the questions,
it's about the chairs.

17:27.816 --> 17:30.416
I need two chairs
with no...no backward tilt.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.440
Make them feel uneasy
as soon as they sit down.

17:33.832 --> 17:36.112
All right, closer, closer. Closer!

17:36.136 --> 17:38.928
I got it.

17:38.952 --> 17:41.232
No, no. OK, screw them down.

17:41.256 --> 17:43.344
I don't want them to be able
to push back.OK. Chippy?

17:43.368 --> 17:45.072
And they can't choose
their own position.

17:45.096 --> 17:46.864
They're not in control here.

17:46.888 --> 17:49.360
They haven't said a word
and they're already off-balance.

17:49.384 --> 17:51.216
Now, I'm the viewer.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.776
I'm watching these two disagree.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.400
They're leaning forward
because they can't lean back.

17:56.424 --> 17:58.832
Right? They're in each other's space
   and I'm, like,

17:58.856 --> 18:01.856
"Are they going to fight,
or what? What's going on?"

18:02.760 --> 18:05.552
Caden?

18:05.576 --> 18:06.832
Great. Thank you very much.

18:06.856 --> 18:09.200
Ben, new position,
but just hold for now.

18:09.224 --> 18:11.248
Stay with them on...

18:11.272 --> 18:14.272
You pop up a second.
Are we all right for sound?Yeah.

18:20.424 --> 18:23.424
Did you take care of that situation
with your mother?

18:24.712 --> 18:27.712
Not yet, no.

18:31.176 --> 18:34.176
Sure.You see, he didn't lean
forward, so he looks timid.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.440
If he had leaned forward,
he'd appear to be aggressive.

18:37.576 --> 18:39.664
Aggressive.
So there's no neutral position.

18:39.688 --> 18:41.392
Neutral is no good.OK.

18:41.416 --> 18:43.504
Neutral is no good.
Can everyone to say that?

18:43.528 --> 18:45.872
The whole group. Neutral is no good.

18:45.896 --> 18:47.600
Neutral is no good!

18:47.624 --> 18:49.780
Neutral is no good!

18:49.804 --> 18:51.696
Neutral is no good!

18:51.720 --> 18:53.872
Neutral is no good!

18:53.896 --> 18:56.048
Neutral is no good!

18:56.072 --> 18:59.072
Neutral is definitely
not...not good.

18:59.208 --> 19:02.208
Thank you.

19:03.176 --> 19:06.176
Kathryn?

19:10.664 --> 19:12.816
Some of the staff have brought it
to my attention

19:12.840 --> 19:15.840
that one of the clients might be
getting a little too close to you.

19:17.644 --> 19:20.304
Close?

19:20.328 --> 19:23.328
The two of you smoke together
almost every day.

19:25.192 --> 19:27.216
I see.

19:27.240 --> 19:30.032
Look, I don't want to sound...
No, I'm embarrassed, that's all.

19:30.056 --> 19:33.056
That wasn't my...
I'm sure it wasn't.

19:35.944 --> 19:37.712
We all care a great deal.

19:37.736 --> 19:40.736
It won't happen again.

19:42.216 --> 19:45.216
They're complex characters.

19:46.568 --> 19:49.168
Damaged.

19:49.192 --> 19:51.792
Even if they don't seem it.

19:51.816 --> 19:54.816
Yes.

21:35.048 --> 21:38.048
Your son specifically
requested this table.

21:40.104 --> 21:43.104
Thank you.

22:00.648 --> 22:02.864
Oh!

22:02.888 --> 22:05.620
Oh!

22:05.644 --> 22:07.856
Are you well?

22:07.880 --> 22:09.456
Yes.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.480
And you?Yes.

22:14.728 --> 22:16.180
Mum, before we start...

22:16.204 --> 22:19.204
Is there a reason you asked me
to lunch?

22:51.080 --> 22:53.552
A rival paper are going to
run a story.

22:53.576 --> 22:54.704
What story?

22:54.728 --> 22:57.712
That you're romantically involved
with a homeless man.

22:57.736 --> 23:00.736
His name's Scott.

23:00.936 --> 23:03.152
They're trying to
embarrass our family.

23:03.176 --> 23:05.136
Well, I'm not embarrassed.

23:05.160 --> 23:08.144
I work there.
This man's interesting.

23:08.168 --> 23:10.320
He's kind.

23:10.344 --> 23:12.560
And I like him.
You can't say you like him.

23:12.584 --> 23:15.584
Why not?

23:15.724 --> 23:18.724
When you find someone in this world,
who you like, you say you like them.

23:21.096 --> 23:22.736
Mum...This is nonsense.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.680
Is it?Are you going to ask?
Your father would have.

23:25.704 --> 23:28.704
He'd say, "Kathryn, are you
fucking him?"

23:31.848 --> 23:34.576
You can't do it, can you?

23:34.600 --> 23:37.600
Only the sad part is you consider
that's a failure.

23:42.472 --> 23:43.792
Can you smoke in here?

23:43.816 --> 23:46.032
No. Mum - you can't smoke.

23:46.056 --> 23:48.144
Well, I'm going to smoke.
Mum - this is serious.

23:48.168 --> 23:51.168
What is the point of having a
private room if you can't do as you
please?

23:51.496 --> 23:54.496
I thought you were going to quit.
I'm not having this
conversation with you.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.592
I'm proposing
we run our own pre-emptive

23:56.616 --> 23:58.192
story about volunteering.

23:58.216 --> 24:01.216
Our own story?Show how friendly
you are with all of them.

24:01.288 --> 24:04.144
Men and women.Young and old?
Something like that.

24:04.168 --> 24:07.088
No. I refuse.How can you refuse?

24:07.112 --> 24:10.112
Because when somebody asks you to do
something ridiculous, you refuse.

24:11.848 --> 24:14.848
Tell your father - I refuse.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.096
I can't...

24:18.120 --> 24:21.120
tell him that.

24:24.008 --> 24:27.008
Tell him you succeeded.

24:27.272 --> 24:29.424
You met your mum.

24:29.448 --> 24:32.448
You had an enjoyable lunch...

24:33.096 --> 24:36.096
..and not hidden away in
some secret room.

24:54.280 --> 24:57.280
Would you throw this away, please?
Certainly, madam.

24:57.736 --> 25:00.736
Was something wrong?No, nothing.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.664
In fact,

25:03.688 --> 25:06.688
why don't you take off your jacket?

25:10.728 --> 25:13.728
And your tie.

25:20.264 --> 25:23.264
Could you hang those up, please?
Of course.

25:23.528 --> 25:26.528
Thank you.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.440
We're going to start again.
I'm going to enjoy a glass of wine.

25:35.496 --> 25:38.496
And I'm going to listen to you talk
about your life. Not your work.

25:40.488 --> 25:43.488
I want to know what's
going on with you.

25:44.008 --> 25:47.008
Girlfriends. Lovers.

25:47.404 --> 25:50.064
Hobbies. Holidays. Movies. Anything.

25:50.088 --> 25:53.088
But not your work.

26:30.728 --> 26:33.728
Do you remember?

26:34.312 --> 26:37.312
When I lost you at the beach?

26:47.816 --> 26:50.816
Caden?

26:52.040 --> 26:55.040
Caden, where are you?

26:57.096 --> 26:59.824
And when I found you,

26:59.848 --> 27:02.848
you were on the sands.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.904
Holding a dying seal.

27:05.928 --> 27:08.928
Caden?

27:09.004 --> 27:11.856
I told you there was nothing we
could do.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.880
We should go back inland
and tell someone.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.320
But you said we should stay.

27:21.608 --> 27:24.608
You didn't want it to die alone.

27:28.456 --> 27:31.456
So we stayed

27:32.296 --> 27:35.296
and we talked and talked...

27:37.992 --> 27:40.992
..so it could hear that it wasn't
alone...

27:43.688 --> 27:46.688
..and you held it in your arms.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.360
And when we ran out of things to
say...

27:52.584 --> 27:55.584
...you started to sing.

28:30.728 --> 28:33.728
# Hold me now

28:34.444 --> 28:37.444
# Hold me now

28:39.240 --> 28:42.240
# In your arms

28:44.232 --> 28:47.232
# Now and every day. #

28:59.016 --> 29:02.016
I was so proud of you.

29:10.728 --> 29:13.728
Well, that was a long time ago.

29:19.944 --> 29:22.944
Not so long ago.

29:26.152 --> 29:29.152
Find a spot over here, maybe.OK.

29:34.728 --> 29:37.728
Something was bothering me
about this story.

29:39.272 --> 29:42.128
The victim was a private
investigator.

29:42.152 --> 29:45.152
His computers were stolen.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.912
When I asked the lead detective...
Who?

29:48.936 --> 29:51.936
Yorke.He's a smart guy.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.360
He says it was a robbery gone wrong.

29:59.496 --> 30:02.496
Too smart to say that.

30:02.824 --> 30:05.824
I took the story to Caden.
Asked if I could dig around.

30:06.472 --> 30:09.472
You know what he says?
He says it was a robbery gone wrong.

30:12.364 --> 30:15.364
He knew about the case?
Even knew to use the same lie.

30:19.272 --> 30:21.744
Tell me why?
Why should I get involved,

30:21.768 --> 30:24.768
when I'm happily retired?

30:27.656 --> 30:30.656
There was a woman at a bus stop,
early one morning.

30:31.048 --> 30:33.648
An alcoholic.

30:33.672 --> 30:36.336
A policeman sees her.
But he doesn't call an ambulance.

30:36.360 --> 30:38.512
He tips off a journalist.

30:38.536 --> 30:41.536
They show up, pay the officer,
photograph the woman.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.720
She's the wife of a politician.

30:48.136 --> 30:51.136
And we all go on,
about our business,

30:51.912 --> 30:54.912
like that's just the way it is.

31:32.360 --> 31:35.360
The kitchen can get a little lively.
It's like student halls.

31:37.288 --> 31:40.288
That's the idea of this place -
a halfway house.

31:41.128 --> 31:44.128
Halfway between being on the street
and being independent.

31:46.248 --> 31:49.248
No-one steals,
but milk in the fridge is fair game.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.400
Is it not rude of me,
turning up like this?

31:59.816 --> 32:01.648
No.

32:01.672 --> 32:03.312
I'm glad you're here.

32:03.336 --> 32:06.336
Just...I wish it wasn't for a
reason.

32:11.404 --> 32:14.404
What is the reason?

32:15.048 --> 32:18.048
Did you sell the story
of our friendship to a newspaper?

32:20.680 --> 32:23.344
What is the story of our friendship?

32:23.368 --> 32:26.368
That we're inappropriately close.

32:28.296 --> 32:30.512
Inappropriate?

32:30.536 --> 32:33.200
There are photographs.

32:33.224 --> 32:36.224
Of us?On the roof.

32:36.616 --> 32:39.616
Even if we were...inappropriate,
which we're not - who would care?

32:41.864 --> 32:44.864
You're not aware of who
I was previously married to?

32:45.320 --> 32:48.304
I'm not angry. But don't lie to me.

32:48.328 --> 32:51.328
I've never lied to you.

32:53.448 --> 32:56.448
I'm not surprised you were married
to someone famous.

32:57.484 --> 32:59.380
Or important.

32:59.404 --> 33:01.936
But I don't know anything about it.

33:01.960 --> 33:04.960
And I didn't sell a story to
a newspaper.

33:07.656 --> 33:10.656
I'm not offended you asked, because
you don't believe that I did.

33:15.848 --> 33:18.848
No.

33:22.120 --> 33:25.120
And you're using
it as a reason to come round here.

33:26.984 --> 33:29.984
Because you wanted to see me.

33:34.792 --> 33:37.792
The first thing they suggest we do,
when we move in here,

33:38.376 --> 33:41.376
is create a daily routine.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.960
Our life.

33:45.484 --> 33:48.484
Hour by hour.

33:50.536 --> 33:53.536
One of the skills you lose on the
street is the ability to structure
time.

33:56.616 --> 33:59.152
I wake up at 6am.

33:59.176 --> 34:01.264
Every morning.

34:01.288 --> 34:04.016
Seven days a week, without fail.

34:04.040 --> 34:07.040
Even though I have no job to go to.

34:07.496 --> 34:10.351
I exercise for 30 minutes.

34:10.376 --> 34:12.400
Push-ups. Sit-ups.

34:12.424 --> 34:13.871
I count them.

34:13.896 --> 34:16.304
I log them.

34:16.328 --> 34:18.800
I clean the shower room.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.527
I shower.

34:20.552 --> 34:21.871
I make the bed.

34:21.896 --> 34:24.896
And so on, the entire day.

34:26.696 --> 34:29.696
Nowhere have I allocated any time

34:30.728 --> 34:33.728
to betraying the only friend
I have in the world.

34:35.335 --> 34:37.936
And nowhere does it say

34:37.960 --> 34:40.431
that I try to kiss her,

34:40.456 --> 34:43.456
even if that feels like something
I want to do.

34:56.072 --> 34:59.072
I'm very proud to be your friend.

35:03.244 --> 35:06.244
So who were you married to?

35:12.648 --> 35:14.416
Third floor.

35:14.440 --> 35:17.440
Good afternoon Mr Finch.
This way, please.Thank you.

35:18.728 --> 35:19.984
Hello.

35:20.008 --> 35:21.712
Angela Howard! We finally meet.

35:21.736 --> 35:23.184
Thank you for taking the time.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.808
Now of course, of course.
Strange, isn't it?

35:25.832 --> 35:28.832
We've only seen each other
in passing at galas and parties.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.376
With a glance and a hello.

35:31.400 --> 35:34.400
Mmm. Well, I'm excited to
hear you talk.

35:35.688 --> 35:38.688
I'm excited to finally have an
audience with you.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.400
No-one left behind. Mmm?

35:43.496 --> 35:46.496
No-one left behind.

35:47.336 --> 35:50.336
No-one left behind.

35:51.048 --> 35:54.048
Angela Howard.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.648
What, what is that?

36:01.672 --> 36:04.672
The building over there.
What, is it? The funny one.

36:05.832 --> 36:06.832
That one.

36:06.856 --> 36:09.072
Riverfront Plaza.
Luxury apartment development.

36:09.096 --> 36:12.096
Not given planning
permission by anyone at this table.

36:12.168 --> 36:15.168
No, because none of you are in
power.

36:15.752 --> 36:18.752
Would you have turned it down? Hmm?

36:21.004 --> 36:24.004
Yes? No?

36:24.844 --> 36:27.700
It's been nicknamed. The Battery.

36:27.724 --> 36:30.724
The Battery?Mmm.

36:30.984 --> 36:32.816
Yeah. Was that the intention?

36:32.840 --> 36:35.840
Oh, I don't think so, no.No.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.680
All those years.
Planning. Designing. Committees.

36:40.328 --> 36:43.328
Brainstorming - The Plaza.
Luxury living.

36:43.976 --> 36:46.976
A kid on the street says, "Daddy,
look at that - it's a battery".

36:48.648 --> 36:51.648
And the kid is right.And it sticks.
    Uh-huh.

36:53.320 --> 36:56.320
You can't outspend the truth.

36:56.968 --> 36:59.968
I have some friends who would
argue that point.

37:02.536 --> 37:05.536
We have strict campaign
spending limits here.

37:07.208 --> 37:09.424
Do you play by the rules?

37:09.448 --> 37:11.792
I don't plan on breaking any.

37:11.816 --> 37:13.456
I do plan on changing them.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.480
Yeah, well, you've gotta win first.
That's right, I do.Yeah.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.112
So your campaign won't be
about money?

37:20.136 --> 37:21.968
Or lying.

37:21.992 --> 37:23.760
I won't tell a single lie.

37:23.784 --> 37:26.784
No money? No lies? What's left?

37:30.312 --> 37:33.312
The truth.

37:34.216 --> 37:37.216
That better be some truth.

37:39.080 --> 37:42.064
All right,
if that's what you've got.

37:42.088 --> 37:45.088
Give it to me. Let me have it.

37:54.056 --> 37:57.056
I can hear them.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.728
You can hear them?

37:59.752 --> 38:02.160
Out there.

38:02.184 --> 38:05.184
Their pain. I can feel it.

38:06.280 --> 38:09.280
I can speak to it.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.560
Maybe you can.

38:19.272 --> 38:22.272
Maybe you can. Maybe you can.

38:23.944 --> 38:25.776
Actually, Mrs Howard -

38:25.800 --> 38:28.784
ladies and gents, if you wouldn't
mind, I do have a few questions.

38:28.808 --> 38:31.216
Yes, anything. Anything at all.

38:31.240 --> 38:34.240
Thank you. About your media policy.

38:43.084 --> 38:46.084
Can she win?
She'd need all our support.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.840
And even then?I'm not so sure.

38:53.448 --> 38:56.448
She's got something.Mmm.

38:59.208 --> 39:02.208
She'd give us anything we wanted.

39:13.928 --> 39:16.928
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:30.184 --> 39:33.184
Just drop me off here.

39:47.404 --> 39:50.404
You know, it occurs to me...

39:51.240 --> 39:54.240
..I haven't seen your new place.

39:55.656 --> 39:57.680
Why, you...you want to come up?

39:57.704 --> 40:00.704
Yeah. Yeah.
I'd like to see where you live.

40:02.440 --> 40:05.440
OK.

40:23.176 --> 40:26.176
Penthouse.

40:55.176 --> 40:58.176
Uh-huh.

41:04.456 --> 41:07.456
Yep.

41:11.496 --> 41:14.496
Is this wheatgrass? Yeah.

41:15.208 --> 41:18.208
It needs a haircut.

41:19.176 --> 41:22.176
Nice. Hah!

41:24.168 --> 41:27.168
Have you ever eaten beef tartare?

41:28.008 --> 41:29.776
I've had it with you, I'm sure.
You know.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.464
On the menu they say,
"served with accoutrements".

41:32.488 --> 41:35.488
Yes.Bowls of pepper and salt.

41:35.688 --> 41:38.480
Capers. Horseradish.
I know what accoutrements are.

41:38.504 --> 41:41.504
Have you ever heard the word
used in another context?

41:41.640 --> 41:43.408
I don't know.

41:43.432 --> 41:46.032
Yeah? Well, think about it.

41:46.056 --> 41:49.056
Take a moment.Maybe.When?

41:49.960 --> 41:52.960
No. Probably not.Right.
Well, it's a little pompous.

41:53.160 --> 41:56.160
A little awkward. As a word.

41:56.360 --> 41:59.360
When else would it be
the right word to use?

42:02.248 --> 42:05.248
You don't like the apartment?

42:07.564 --> 42:10.564
Why do we make a mistake?

42:11.404 --> 42:13.360
Why do WE, or why do I?

42:13.384 --> 42:15.664
A person, any person.
Why would a person make a mistake?

42:15.688 --> 42:17.840
Lots of reasons.

42:17.864 --> 42:20.272
In my experience, there aren't
a lot of reasons.

42:20.296 --> 42:23.296
Lack of information?
Stupidity? Clumsiness?

42:25.416 --> 42:28.416
Or is it protest?

42:29.640 --> 42:32.112
What am I protesting against?

42:32.136 --> 42:35.056
Honestly, I don't know.
That's why I'm asking you.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.300
It puzzles me.

42:37.324 --> 42:39.664
I think about it.
And I think about it.

42:39.688 --> 42:41.904
I come up with nothing.

42:41.928 --> 42:44.656
That's because there is nothing.

42:44.680 --> 42:46.512
Really?

42:46.536 --> 42:49.536
And don't tell me what you think
I want to hear.

42:56.712 --> 42:59.712
The questions I asked.
We never ask for anything.

43:01.192 --> 43:04.192
We put ourselves in a position
and it's offered to us.

43:04.648 --> 43:07.120
Yes, I've heard you say that
many times before.

43:07.144 --> 43:09.744
And yet here we are.
So you must have wanted this.

43:09.768 --> 43:11.344
This must have been your intention.

43:11.368 --> 43:14.368
For the two of us
to be standing here, face-to-face.

43:15.400 --> 43:18.192
OK, so go ahead.

43:18.216 --> 43:21.216
Tell me what you want to say.
Talk to me.

43:25.768 --> 43:28.768
It's all right. Go ahead.

43:31.464 --> 43:34.464
No?

43:37.736 --> 43:40.736
You tried. It's all right.

43:43.240 --> 43:46.240
Please.

43:56.424 --> 43:59.424
You can't do it, can you?

44:03.592 --> 44:06.592
Why do you make it so hard?

44:54.856 --> 44:57.856
I'm dying.

44:58.056 --> 45:00.464
Cancer.

45:00.488 --> 45:03.488
Don't say anything.
That's not why I'm here.

45:05.288 --> 45:08.288
I want to help you
with this investigation.

45:08.744 --> 45:11.744
But I want you to understand
it will be my last.

45:15.272 --> 45:18.272
So it can't be about a few private
detectives.

45:19.880 --> 45:22.880
We go for the top.

45:23.016 --> 45:24.592
We go for Caden.

45:24.616 --> 45:27.472
We go for Max.

45:27.496 --> 45:30.496
We make a difference.

45:31.720 --> 45:34.720
Are you prepared to do that?

45:36.008 --> 45:37.264
I am.

45:37.288 --> 45:40.288
Hmm!

45:44.136 --> 45:47.136
Penthouse.

46:41.416 --> 46:44.416
I need you to pretend
that you know nothing about sex.

46:46.536 --> 46:49.536
You want me to pretend I'm a virgin?

46:50.568 --> 46:53.104
No.

46:53.128 --> 46:56.128
I need you to pretend you know
nothing about your body.

46:56.392 --> 46:58.224
Or mine.

46:58.248 --> 47:01.248
No knowledge of any kind.

47:02.536 --> 47:05.536
Let me put it another way.

47:07.016 --> 47:10.016
Take off your dress.

47:10.856 --> 47:13.856
No. I say, "Take off your dress".
You say, "What is a dress?"

47:16.684 --> 47:19.540
Take off your dress.
I'm sorry, sir, what is a dress?

47:19.564 --> 47:22.564
No. You should use your ordinary
voice.

47:23.848 --> 47:26.704
Let's try again.

47:26.728 --> 47:29.728
Take off your dress.

47:30.696 --> 47:33.696
What is a dress?Good.

47:36.008 --> 47:39.008
Your dress is the material
covering your body.

47:39.400 --> 47:42.400
What is my body?

47:55.976 --> 47:58.976
This is your body.

48:00.456 --> 48:03.456
Find your dress.

48:03.848 --> 48:06.848
Now take it off.

48:17.480 --> 48:19.632
Take off your panties.

48:19.656 --> 48:22.656
What are my panties?

48:23.048 --> 48:26.048
The material covering your cunt.

48:27.976 --> 48:30.976
What is my cunt?

48:31.048 --> 48:34.048
The slit between your legs.

48:36.040 --> 48:39.040
You mean this?

48:41.032 --> 48:43.312
That slit is called your mouth.

48:43.336 --> 48:46.336
Does my cunt have these?

48:46.536 --> 48:48.496
Yes.

48:48.520 --> 48:51.520
Find your other set of lips.

49:01.768 --> 49:04.768
I found them.

49:08.616 --> 49:11.616
Are they moist?What is moist?

49:29.032 --> 49:32.032
Are they moist?Yes.

49:32.872 --> 49:35.600
Don't tell me
what you think I want to hear.

49:35.624 --> 49:37.712
Never tell me
what you think I want to hear.

49:37.736 --> 49:40.720
Are they moist?

49:40.744 --> 49:43.744
No.

50:02.248 --> 50:03.888
What do you see?

50:03.912 --> 50:06.912
I don't know.You see a man.

50:08.200 --> 50:11.200
What is a man?THIS IS A MAN!

50:11.656 --> 50:14.064
This is a man.

50:14.088 --> 50:16.496
This is a man.

50:16.520 --> 50:19.520
This is a man.

50:19.976 --> 50:22.976
What do you feel?
I don't know the word.

50:24.648 --> 50:27.648
Pleasure?What is pleasure?

50:28.040 --> 50:31.040
The opposite of pain.

51:52.136 --> 51:55.136
Accoutrements!

51:57.768 --> 52:00.768
Accoutrements!

52:11.656 --> 52:13.936
Fuck you! Accoutrements!

52:13.960 --> 52:16.960
Accoutrements!

53:37.160 --> 53:39.056
I see my friend.

53:39.080 --> 53:41.424
I see my friend.

53:41.448 --> 53:44.448
Hello.

53:57.896 --> 54:00.896
Penthouse.

54:11.848 --> 54:14.848
Caden.

54:16.008 --> 54:19.008
Caden!

54:20.680 --> 54:23.680
Caden!

54:31.624 --> 54:34.624
I'm Caden's mother!

55:19.880 --> 55:22.880
He'll survive.

55:25.128 --> 55:27.024
How can you know that?

55:27.048 --> 55:30.048
Because he was born fighting.

55:32.104 --> 55:35.104
I watched him arrive into this world
  more dead than alive.

55:37.608 --> 55:40.608
His umbilical cord around his neck.

55:40.936 --> 55:43.936
Skin was blue.

55:46.184 --> 55:49.184
But he hung on.

55:49.256 --> 55:51.472
Only you could speak about
the birth of my child

55:51.496 --> 55:54.288
as though I weren't there.

55:54.312 --> 55:57.312
You were there...
but you didn't see.

55:58.408 --> 55:59.984
You're right.

56:00.008 --> 56:03.008
I couldn't see.

56:04.424 --> 56:07.424
There were doctors and
nurses huddled around him.

56:11.464 --> 56:14.464
But I didn't need to see.

56:15.624 --> 56:18.624
I knew.

56:19.848 --> 56:22.848
When they handed him to me...

56:25.608 --> 56:28.608
..the most beautiful,
fragile little boy...

56:32.648 --> 56:34.736
..barely ready for this world.

56:34.760 --> 56:37.760
Yes. Yes, yes, yes...

56:38.216 --> 56:41.216
When you stepped forward
to take him from me...

56:45.192 --> 56:48.192
..I had an instinct...

56:51.336 --> 56:54.336
..not to let him go.

57:38.120 --> 57:41.120
Oh, my God.
