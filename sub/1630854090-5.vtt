WEBVTT

00:19.541 --> 00:21.666
-Hey.
-<i>And how are you this morning?</i>

00:21.750 --> 00:24.125
Freaking out. I said I'd meet you.
Where are you?

00:24.208 --> 00:28.166
-Sadly, uh, I can't make it today.
-<i>Seriously?</i>

00:28.250 --> 00:31.208
Look, I can't keep finding excuses
to leave school.

00:31.291 --> 00:34.083
Don't stress. We'll work something out.

00:34.166 --> 00:36.083
-<i>Talk soon.</i>

00:43.666 --> 00:44.791
He's not coming.

00:53.625 --> 00:54.833
What did he say?

00:55.458 --> 00:57.125
-"We'll work something out."
-Ah.

00:57.208 --> 01:00.250
-I think he knows what we're up to.
-It wouldn't surprise me.

01:00.333 --> 01:03.083
Bavani is convinced
he's got spies everywhere.

01:03.166 --> 01:05.125
I trust every soldier here.

01:05.208 --> 01:09.583
Six more fairies drained.
In six different regions of Solaria.

01:10.666 --> 01:12.708
You think he's stalling for time.

01:14.625 --> 01:17.750
<i>Every day out in the world,</i>
<i>he's gathering strength.</i>

01:17.833 --> 01:23.166
<i>With more Blood Witches. More magic.</i>
<i>He'll be stronger than me soon.</i>

01:24.958 --> 01:28.333
<i>We just have to hope we can stop him</i>
<i>before he's stronger than Bloom.</i>

02:18.291 --> 02:22.125
It's the third time he's flaked.
I don't get why it's not working.

02:22.875 --> 02:26.666
Maybe because Rosalind
is always, like, ten meters away?

02:26.750 --> 02:29.958
Or maybe because he has no real incentive
to sit down with you?

02:30.041 --> 02:31.875
And it's always on your turf.

02:31.958 --> 02:35.000
Oh, you're the Dragon Flame,
the destroyer of worlds!

02:35.083 --> 02:40.166
Okay, I'm hearing a lot of naysaying.
I wanna hear more yea-saying, please.

02:40.250 --> 02:42.500
I just hate seeing Rosalind
use you as bait.

02:42.583 --> 02:45.666
Ooh! Unappealing bait. Mortifying.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.875
It was my idea, and I know
Sebastian wants to sit down with me.

02:48.958 --> 02:51.541
Look, best case scenario, we capture him.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.375
Worst case, we'll get answers.

02:53.458 --> 02:55.458
Is that the worst case you can think of?

02:55.541 --> 02:57.166
I finished cleaning the bathrooms

02:57.250 --> 02:59.916
and even helped Doris prep for tonight,
all before lunch.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.416
I was hoping, once I've had my checkup
at the greenhouse,

03:03.500 --> 03:05.500
I could maybe have the afternoon off.

03:05.583 --> 03:08.958
So, you get a break
while the students study their magic?

03:10.208 --> 03:12.125
Be grateful you're still here.

03:12.708 --> 03:15.583
Come to my office.
I'll find you something to do.

03:21.291 --> 03:24.791
Sebastian stole Musa's magic,
and he'll know how to get it back.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.375
That's the only thing that matters.

03:36.458 --> 03:37.708
Looking for this?

03:37.791 --> 03:41.208
Not one to be nosy, but I'm fairly certain
this is a Solarian seal.

03:41.291 --> 03:42.958
It's from the royal archives.

03:43.625 --> 03:46.041
I, uh, wrote to my mum
a couple of days ago

03:46.125 --> 03:48.375
asking for forgiveness and a favor.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.500
Looks like it worked.

03:50.583 --> 03:51.583
I'm intrigued.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.291
Seriously? I'm an orphaned,
magicless fairy

03:57.375 --> 03:59.791
relegated to chore duties
to stay at this school.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.958
A little secret might brighten my day.

04:04.541 --> 04:06.500
I will text you later. I promise.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.000
-We can trust her, you know?
-She's Beatrix.

04:14.583 --> 04:17.333
-You trust Rosalind.
-You both have terrible judgment.

04:17.416 --> 04:20.458
Except Rosalind has literally
been on our side since day one.

04:21.291 --> 04:24.458
I know you love dunking on me
for being close with her,

04:24.541 --> 04:28.958
but if I weren't, do you two think Musa
would be able to stay at this school?

04:29.041 --> 04:31.125
Are those absolutely necessary?

04:31.208 --> 04:34.416
Yeah. These scraper scars are so small,
I can barely see them.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.500
Whoever treated you was a master.

04:37.583 --> 04:40.416
Or mistress. No, that sounded wrong.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.541
You've done a lovely job, Terra..

04:42.625 --> 04:45.208
-Flora and I were just talking about it
-Yeah.

04:47.125 --> 04:51.458
-Oh. Hi, boys. What can we do for you?
-We are out of willow bark at the Bastion.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.041
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Flora's hogging all the herbs.

04:54.125 --> 04:56.958
She's testing a remedy
for Blood Witch mind control.

04:57.041 --> 05:00.666
I just hate the idea they can take over
someone's body, their agency.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.333
-She's a free spirit, folks.
-Yes, this much I know.

05:04.166 --> 05:06.083
Bleurgh! Can you not, in front of me?

05:06.166 --> 05:08.125
There is nothing to not, Terra.

05:08.208 --> 05:11.500
I already told you,
we're just friends, not soulmates.

05:12.458 --> 05:15.666
Speaking of,
how are things on love island?

05:15.750 --> 05:17.041
Uh…

05:17.916 --> 05:19.000
Uh…

05:19.083 --> 05:22.125
Not the reaction I was expecting.
I heard there was an epic kiss.

05:22.208 --> 05:25.583
And then epic silence.
Apparently, she's got some project.

05:25.666 --> 05:29.291
-Aisha gets tunnel vision sometimes.
-We'll tell her you're outside the tunnel.

05:29.375 --> 05:33.041
Now, if you'll excuse us, Musa's got
some magic rehab exercises to do.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.750
Uh, actually, Silva was asking for Musa.

05:36.833 --> 05:39.708
He needs another debrief
about what happened at the lodge.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.166
Okay.

05:55.375 --> 05:58.583
You haven't told anyone
what I told you, right?

05:58.666 --> 06:00.125
No, of course not, Terra.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.375
It's for you to tell,
whenever you're ready.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.083
<i> What does Silva need?</i>

06:05.166 --> 06:08.708
Nothing. I just thought
you could use a save.

06:10.416 --> 06:15.125
I've seen you in there every day
doing some, like, breathing exercises.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.416
She got you doing yoga shit.

06:18.125 --> 06:22.708
She calls it "Terra-robics."
She thinks I can down-dog my powers back.

06:25.125 --> 06:28.041
Well, thanks. Uh, that's twice.

06:29.291 --> 06:32.291
I never got to thank you
for bringing me back to the school.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.666
I can barely remember anything.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.291
Uh, yeah, you were out cold.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.875
I chucked you over my shoulder
and got the fuck out.

06:40.958 --> 06:42.000
You chucked me?

06:42.083 --> 06:46.250
Sorry. I'll be more delicate next time
I'm saving your ass from fucking monsters.

06:49.083 --> 06:51.125
Anyway, I've gotta train.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.125
Let me know if you need another save.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.583
Actually, can I come?

06:58.083 --> 06:59.750
I'm meant to check in with Rosalind,

06:59.833 --> 07:02.750
but if I can convince her
that I'm helping the Specialists…

07:03.250 --> 07:05.333
Nice. Yeah, you can help me spar.

07:05.916 --> 07:06.791
Okay.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.250
How was training today?

07:17.500 --> 07:19.333
I bailed.

07:21.541 --> 07:22.958
I wasn't really in the mood.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.166
Well maybe it's not a bad idea
to stay active.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.541
Keep your mind off things.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.375
Silva told me
the sting was a bust this morning.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.333
That sucks.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.083
Yeah.

07:44.833 --> 07:47.333
I think I have
to offer Sebastian something,

07:47.416 --> 07:48.416
like a bribe.

07:52.083 --> 07:54.791
-What could you offer?
-Mm. Uh.

07:55.791 --> 07:58.583
Other than the ability
to annihilate the Otherworld,

07:58.666 --> 08:00.708
maybe… cool shoes?

08:04.916 --> 08:06.291
What about the book?

08:07.166 --> 08:10.791
The Blood Witch book. Remember?
You went to my house to get the text.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.750
-Yes.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.666
-Of course I remember that day.

08:17.416 --> 08:18.625
Because of the mission.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.291
The only memorable thing
that happened that day.

08:22.375 --> 08:25.166
<i>-Mm.
</i>

08:25.250 --> 08:27.625
-I guess the fire was a close second.

08:28.833 --> 08:30.833
-Seriously?

08:32.250 --> 08:35.291
Why? Did something else happen between us?

08:40.166 --> 08:42.166
I… Honestly, I can't remember.

08:47.583 --> 08:48.875
Mm-hmm.

08:48.958 --> 08:51.000
That seems… seems familiar.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.958
-You might have to jog my memory more.
-Mm. Mm-hmm.

09:10.083 --> 09:13.875
You can't keep ignoring what happened
to Andreas by focusing on me.

09:18.583 --> 09:20.833
-Are you sure?

09:27.583 --> 09:28.666
I've gotta run.

09:29.708 --> 09:30.833
Guard duty.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Text you later, okay?

09:53.583 --> 09:55.666
-How's he doing?
-Not fine.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.333
No matter how much he pretends.

09:58.166 --> 10:02.125
Does Grey do that?
The whole "I'm fine" act.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.625
Honestly, I'm probably
more closed off than he is.

10:12.166 --> 10:13.375
Where's he been lately?

10:15.458 --> 10:17.875
We just have
too much important stuff to handle.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.041
Sebastian. Musa.

10:20.708 --> 10:21.916
I have to refocus.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.125
Well, Sky has a suggestion on that front.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.500
I'm gonna offer Sebastian
the Blood Witch book.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.458
Or, hear me out,

10:32.083 --> 10:34.375
you don't sit down
with a diabolical Blood Witch

10:34.458 --> 10:37.375
and give him a book
that obviously contains evil secrets,

10:37.458 --> 10:39.458
and we get Musa's magic back ourselves.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.041
Wanna see something cool?

10:44.166 --> 10:46.833
-It's a convergence crystal.
-Okay.

10:46.916 --> 10:50.500
You act like I come from a place where
that doesn't sound ridiculous.

10:50.583 --> 10:55.083
It lets fairies combine magic.
It's a relic. Super rare.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.666
Perks of being suitemates with a princess.

10:57.750 --> 11:01.041
Here's the theory.
Fairy magic is like a battery.

11:01.833 --> 11:06.041
Scrapers drain us till the battery's dead,
but a dead battery is still a battery.

11:06.708 --> 11:10.625
Musa is still a fairy.
We just need to… jump-start her.

11:12.291 --> 11:13.583
Is it dangerous?

11:14.166 --> 11:16.416
To be honest, yes,
but no more than your plan.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.958
-My plan only puts me in danger, so--
-I messed up at the pub, Bloom.

11:20.958 --> 11:24.333
I was off with Grey, and left you
dealing with everyone by yourself.

11:24.416 --> 11:27.125
But I'm back now. I got this.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.000
I don't want you mixed up with Sebastian.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.750
I know how he tried
to get under your skin.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.500
He has other tricks up his sleeve.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.041
Please! Please! Please!
Please! Andreas, don't!

11:53.333 --> 11:55.375
<i>Do what you have to.</i>
<i>Do what you have to.</i>

11:57.250 --> 11:58.416
I'm sorry.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.333
Go back to your fucking dorm.

12:16.375 --> 12:17.458
It's00 a.m.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.541
Look, guys, come on.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.541
It's not funny.

13:29.416 --> 13:30.958
It's a beautiful stone.

13:31.583 --> 13:32.916
It just arrived.

13:34.291 --> 13:37.708
From a quarry in Eraklyon
near where he grew up.

13:38.833 --> 13:39.666
It's simple,

13:39.750 --> 13:43.166
but "miserable, sentimental fuckwit"
wouldn't fit.

13:48.541 --> 13:50.291
He would've thought that was funny.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.375
You really cared about him.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.166
-You seem surprised.

13:56.250 --> 14:00.958
I guess I just thought you'd have
a Rosalind-style outlook on death.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.916
-Something cold and unemotional.
-You'd think.

14:05.833 --> 14:08.000
I've buried a lot of friends in my life.

14:09.083 --> 14:13.583
I can get over deaths
that serve a greater purpose,

14:13.666 --> 14:15.375
but something like this?

14:17.791 --> 14:18.916
It's just shit.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.125
I'm sorry.

14:24.791 --> 14:27.375
-If you wanna skip training this morning--
-No.

14:28.666 --> 14:30.041
I need you in top form.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.625
Sebastian has already taken
one person I care about.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.916
I won't let him take another.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.625
-Stella, you're not pulling.
-Terra, they'll be here soon.

14:47.916 --> 14:48.875
Redecorating?

14:48.958 --> 14:52.458
Sorry. We needed a bit more space
for Musa's convergence ceremony.

14:52.541 --> 14:54.291
My con-what ceremony?

14:54.875 --> 14:56.458
Actually, before we, um…

14:56.541 --> 14:58.375
…before we start that,

14:58.458 --> 15:01.583
uh, we haven't all been
in the same room for a few days.

15:01.666 --> 15:03.541
Now that we are, I've got an announcement.

15:03.625 --> 15:04.958
It's nothing bad or weird.

15:05.041 --> 15:07.583
I mean, maybe it is weird.
I don't think it's weird.

15:07.666 --> 15:10.708
Uh, also, like, it's, um…
it's not a big deal.

15:10.791 --> 15:13.708
It is a big deal to me,
but I don't need a celebration or a cake.

15:13.791 --> 15:15.916
Not that you'd get a cake. Um…

15:18.125 --> 15:19.541
Uh

15:19.625 --> 15:21.750
So, um…

15:23.750 --> 15:24.833
I'm gay.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.833
There's a part of me
that's always known that I was gay,

15:28.916 --> 15:32.625
and now I'm sharing
that part of me with you.

15:32.708 --> 15:35.250
Uh, so kindly adjust
your perceptions of me accordingly.

15:35.333 --> 15:39.541
Uh… cool, okay,
so, um, I need to move this carpet,

15:39.625 --> 15:41.875
so if someone could give me a hand
that'd be really good.

15:42.750 --> 15:43.583
Terra.

15:54.625 --> 15:55.958
Oh.

15:56.541 --> 15:58.583
This is really nice, actually.

16:00.583 --> 16:05.208
I suppose, you know, this means
we're your official wing-women now.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.583
Yeah, we're gonna snag you a lady.

16:07.666 --> 16:11.583
Oh, snagging a lady's a heteronormative
paradigm I'm not certain I ascribe to.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.208
Really? I'm sure you already
have your eye on someone.

16:14.291 --> 16:15.208
Do we know her?

16:15.291 --> 16:16.291
-Who?
-We need popcorn.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.375
-Do we know her?
-I will need approval.

16:18.458 --> 16:21.416
We're forgetting why we're here.
This isn't a coming-out party.

16:21.500 --> 16:25.416
This is a Musa-and-her-magic party,
so let's all maybe just start on that.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.041
A Musa-and-her-what party? Uh… can…

16:28.125 --> 16:31.375
Can we just track back?
What's… what's the party for me?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.666
Well, this carpet isn't gonna move itself.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.583
Got it. Yeah, course.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.958
-Yes?

16:47.875 --> 16:49.291
Sky, how are you?

16:49.375 --> 16:52.041
-A little tired from my night shift, but--
-Clearly.

16:53.541 --> 16:56.583
Saul put you on guard duty
because he said we could trust you.

16:56.666 --> 17:00.125
Well, you can trust me.
So, what's going on?

17:00.958 --> 17:04.208
We think somebody may have
broken into the East Wing last night.

17:04.291 --> 17:07.875
My office door was jimmied
and files were out of place.

17:07.958 --> 17:12.375
Files that contained troop movements
and asset lists.

17:12.458 --> 17:14.833
Information the Blood Witches
would kill for.

17:14.916 --> 17:16.958
Only they didn't need to kill.

17:17.625 --> 17:22.000
They just needed to sneak past
our loyal but sleepy guard.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.500
You think a Blood Witch
broke into the East Wing?

17:25.583 --> 17:29.791
Yes. It appears we have a mole.
What did you see last night?

17:29.875 --> 17:31.708
I didn't see anything, I swear.

17:31.791 --> 17:33.208
Mm.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.333
Love to take your word for it, but--

17:36.416 --> 17:38.583
Rosalind, if he says
he didn't see anything,

17:38.666 --> 17:40.166
he didn't see anything.

17:42.708 --> 17:44.916
Thank you, Sky. You're dismissed.

17:56.583 --> 17:59.791
Not looking a gift horse
in the mouth or anything, but…

17:59.875 --> 18:02.541
…how dangerous do you expect
this little exercise to be?

18:02.625 --> 18:04.000
I won't sugarcoat this.

18:04.083 --> 18:09.000
We're mainlining raw magic here,
so, yeah, it's risky, but…

18:10.041 --> 18:11.250
I have faith in us.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.000
Let's do this.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.208
Oh!

18:14.291 --> 18:18.500
Fair warning. I am trying something new.
Bit of mineral magic, so no judgment.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.833
All right. Now, let's do this.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.333
All right, everyone. Now pull it in.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.416
Okay, Musa.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.916
Open yourself up to magic, like normal.

19:28.708 --> 19:32.083
The rest of us,
open yourselves up to Musa.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.875
Should I be feeling something?

19:46.375 --> 19:47.291
Yeah.

19:48.291 --> 19:49.458
Is everyone focusing?

19:49.541 --> 19:50.833
-Mm!
-Mm-hmm.

19:51.625 --> 19:52.625
Try again.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.666
Nope. Still nothing.

20:05.041 --> 20:07.250
I think, maybe, we don't have
quite enough power.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.708
The Dragon Flame?

20:12.375 --> 20:13.250
Are you sure?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.458
-Only if you can control it.
-I can.

20:24.875 --> 20:25.916
Everybody ready?

20:28.041 --> 20:30.000
Okay.

20:46.958 --> 20:48.375
Okay, Musa, let's try again.

21:03.208 --> 21:04.875
It's working, right?

21:04.958 --> 21:07.708
Something's working.
I can feel my magic. It's powerful.

21:09.666 --> 21:11.125
Same. I've never felt like this.

21:13.458 --> 21:17.000
Ready? I'm gonna give it
one more little push.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.291
Hang on.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.625
-Musa, we're so close. We can do this.
-Hang on.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.541
Just concentrate, Musa. I promise.

21:22.625 --> 21:23.916
I said stop!

21:27.875 --> 21:29.083
What happened?

21:31.083 --> 21:33.750
-It wasn't working.
-It was working.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.791
Musa! What's wrong?

21:39.166 --> 21:41.458
-Why are you still holding onto magic?
-I'm not.

21:41.541 --> 21:43.416
-Bloom, are you?
-No.

21:45.666 --> 21:47.083
Oh. Okay.

21:47.791 --> 21:49.375
Good. Bit worried there.

21:49.458 --> 21:51.500
-I'm gonna find Musa.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.625
It was a good idea, Aisha. It was.

22:06.791 --> 22:08.041
Can I text Sebastian now?

22:08.875 --> 22:11.250
I'll get information about Musa
and I'll come home. Promise.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.666
How will you get that book
without Rosalind knowing?

22:13.750 --> 22:16.916
Stella thinks we can trust Beatrix now.
I guess we'll find out.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.958
Hello, this is Beatrix
from the Alfea college.

22:20.041 --> 22:21.375
We're updating our records

22:21.458 --> 22:24.125
and want to confirm
Luke's birthday and home address.

22:24.625 --> 22:25.875
Kill me now.

22:25.958 --> 22:27.583
Lovely. Thank you.

22:29.583 --> 22:31.291
Rosalind's on mole patrol,

22:31.375 --> 22:34.416
so I'm double-checking the records
of every student at Alfea.

22:34.916 --> 22:38.083
I've made a hundred phone calls so far.
Only a hundred to go.

22:38.166 --> 22:39.458
Sounds dreadful.

22:40.416 --> 22:42.833
-Shall I help?
-What do you want?

22:43.416 --> 22:46.666
Just… shut up and move over.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.625
It's poetic.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.833
Last year, I was the one
everyone was concerned about.

23:00.416 --> 23:03.000
I was powerful. People were scared of me.

23:04.791 --> 23:08.541
Now I'm groveling at Rosalind's feet
for menial tasks just to stay involved.

23:08.625 --> 23:10.875
You know it doesn't hurt to play the game.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.458
You should see the letter
I wrote to my mum.

23:14.541 --> 23:16.666
I wish it had been
as dignified as groveling.

23:16.750 --> 23:20.000
I thought you said that letter
was for that little package Aisha wanted.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.833
Yeah, I mean, it was mostly, but…

23:25.083 --> 23:26.125
…I don't know.

23:26.875 --> 23:29.000
Maybe I'm just sick of being frozen out.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.958
Being a good little princess
is the one tactic I haven't tried yet.

23:33.041 --> 23:34.583
Somebody misses her privilege.

23:40.375 --> 23:45.208
Okay, um, so… I do have a favor to ask.

23:48.791 --> 23:51.041
Do you still have access
to Rosalind's office?

23:51.625 --> 23:55.166
Once Beatrix has updated
the electronic records,

23:55.250 --> 23:59.500
I can then cross-reference them
with the admissions paperwork.

23:59.583 --> 24:00.666
A good plan.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.000
Yes, which is why
this seems a bit excessive.

24:03.083 --> 24:06.416
The moment we start asking questions,
our mole will break cover and run.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.166
I'm just ensuring they don't get very far.

24:09.250 --> 24:12.041
I fear we will alarm
the students, Rosalind.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.833
You're full of opinions, Saul.

24:13.916 --> 24:17.291
I speak my mind. I am not Andreas.

24:17.375 --> 24:19.208
And I'm not Farah.

24:21.375 --> 24:25.458
If you want to make yourself useful,
go and find that delinquent you raised.

24:25.541 --> 24:28.750
See if you can get some information
out of his head about the break in.

24:28.833 --> 24:30.166
If you don't, I will.

24:30.708 --> 24:34.416
I just hope that when I finish,
he can still form sentences.

24:35.791 --> 24:36.958
<i>No promises.</i>

24:43.458 --> 24:44.708
May I help you?

24:45.666 --> 24:46.750
Stella has class.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.500
I'm bringing the book out to Bloom.

24:50.875 --> 24:52.625
-Do you have it?
-Strange.

24:53.500 --> 24:55.750
I thought you'd apologize
for killing my dad.

24:55.833 --> 24:57.541
He was my dad, Beatrix.

24:58.791 --> 25:00.458
And he was gonna kill Silva.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.291
I had no choice.

25:04.083 --> 25:05.500
And you know I had no choice.

25:14.916 --> 25:18.708
And because of that, everyone else
is gonna let you off the hook.

25:24.291 --> 25:25.666
I won't.

25:54.875 --> 25:57.791
Beatrix actually came through.
Maybe she has changed.

25:57.875 --> 25:59.125
I wouldn't count on it.

25:59.916 --> 26:02.041
Why'd you ask Sebastian
to meet in the First World?

26:03.291 --> 26:05.625
He seems to like it, given his whole vibe.

26:09.458 --> 26:10.416
I should go.

26:10.500 --> 26:11.375
Yeah.

26:19.041 --> 26:21.041
-I'll text you when…

26:38.416 --> 26:39.500
It's solid.

26:42.875 --> 26:46.375
Well, it's a good thing
we got that kiss in.

26:49.250 --> 26:51.625
Bloom, I'll support you
no matter what you do, but--

26:51.708 --> 26:53.750
-You don't want me to go.
-I didn't say that--

26:53.833 --> 26:57.916
You didn't say anything. The one benefit
of you never talking about your problems.

26:59.708 --> 27:01.541
I'm stronger than him, Sky.

27:02.375 --> 27:03.666
I'm much stronger.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.083
You have nothing to worry about.

27:09.208 --> 27:12.375
You know why I don't talk about
all my problems with you, Bloom?

27:14.416 --> 27:16.041
It's 'cause you're the solution.

27:35.583 --> 27:36.791
I got this.

27:41.583 --> 27:42.583
I promise.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.625
<i> Don't be so weak.</i>

27:49.708 --> 27:52.708
One, you're a girl,
so I'm not gonna go all out.

27:52.791 --> 27:54.125
Misogynistic.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.541
Ow!

28:01.625 --> 28:05.541
Two, cool moves aside,
you're not a Specialist

28:05.625 --> 28:06.583
You could get hurt.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.375
Bit more valid.

28:14.416 --> 28:17.833
Three, there's something else
behind this aggression.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.791
I'm not sure what it is.

28:31.125 --> 28:33.125
Musa, there you are.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.250
Never mind.

28:36.166 --> 28:37.125
I know what it is.

28:37.208 --> 28:40.291
This is weird.
Riven, can you give us a moment?

28:43.916 --> 28:45.000
What are you…

28:48.625 --> 28:50.666
I don't have anything else to say.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.750
Okay. Well, I do.

28:53.333 --> 28:57.083
I'm tired of talking, and trying,
and Terra-robics. I'm done.

28:57.166 --> 28:59.750
We've had one setback.
You can't just give up.

29:01.583 --> 29:03.583
I'm happy you're living your truth.

29:03.666 --> 29:05.916
It doesn't make you the expert
on everyone else's.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.333
So, can you please
just mind your own business?

29:09.625 --> 29:10.916
Not about this, no.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.208
So you can whine
and call me overbearing and annoying,

29:14.291 --> 29:15.458
but I'm not gonna stop.

29:15.541 --> 29:17.583
Not until you get your magic back. Musa!

29:22.833 --> 29:26.416
-What the hell?
-Oi, Terra. This seems a bit much.

29:26.500 --> 29:30.625
No, I… I didn't do it on purpose.
There's something wrong with my magic.

29:30.708 --> 29:32.750
It's a side effect of the ceremony.

29:32.833 --> 29:34.250
Because we didn't complete it,

29:34.333 --> 29:36.416
our magic is still connected
to the crystal.

29:36.916 --> 29:39.458
We're basically
low-key channeling, constantly.

29:39.541 --> 29:42.125
Yeah, you're right.
I feel it. It's right there.

29:42.208 --> 29:45.291
Makes sense why Terra lost control.
So, what do we do?

29:45.375 --> 29:46.750
-Well, I--

29:49.666 --> 29:50.625
What?

29:51.125 --> 29:53.458
Grey, sorry.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.416
I didn't think…

29:55.500 --> 29:58.833
I'd just pop over unannounced
like a creeper, yeah. My bad.

29:58.916 --> 30:01.375
Um, I kinda need to talk to you.

30:03.416 --> 30:05.625
Can we go somewhere a little more private?

30:05.708 --> 30:08.916
Actually, no, we can't. Not now.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.208
I'm sorry. I'll text you later, though.

30:14.041 --> 30:15.041
Did I fuck up?

30:15.125 --> 30:16.791
Oh, God no, Grey.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.875
We just have a few crises here and…

30:22.791 --> 30:24.625
I promise, you're fine.

30:25.208 --> 30:27.458
Please just come and find me
when you can, yeah?

30:28.416 --> 30:29.416
I will.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.041
What was that?

30:38.333 --> 30:41.583
The solution to one of our crises.
Thanks for that.

30:50.041 --> 30:51.750
If you let him in a bit more,

30:51.833 --> 30:53.916
he'll understand
why you need to shut him out.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.833
-Boyfriend 101.
-Grey will be fine, and we will be too.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.166
Here. Channel your magic.

31:07.541 --> 31:09.541
-How do you feel?
-Normal.

31:09.625 --> 31:13.333
Exactly. We just have to discharge
our magic into the crystal.

31:13.416 --> 31:17.666
-So it's sorted.
-Not yet. I have to call Bloom.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.375
Coffee? Something to eat?

31:50.625 --> 31:53.375
Yeah. I ordered a chicken-fried steak.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.916
What the fuck is a chicken-fried steak?

32:02.291 --> 32:03.333
Thank you.

32:03.833 --> 32:06.291
When I said let's meet in the First World,

32:06.375 --> 32:10.000
I assumed you'd choose some place
that's more, uh, clandestine,

32:10.083 --> 32:12.833
like an underground parking garage.

32:12.916 --> 32:13.916
Boring.

32:14.625 --> 32:16.500
No, I love First World kitsch.

32:17.083 --> 32:19.750
Can't get more First World kitsch
than an American diner.

32:21.625 --> 32:22.833
Also, uh…

32:24.333 --> 32:25.708
I've got trust issues.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.208
-What are you doing?
-You should hate me, Bloom.

32:35.291 --> 32:38.458
I stole your friend's magic,
I made your boyfriend kill his dad,

32:38.541 --> 32:41.750
I am a scourge to fairykind,
yet here you are.

32:42.708 --> 32:44.125
Make that make sense.

32:47.125 --> 32:48.250
I do hate you.

32:48.958 --> 32:51.625
I wish you were rotting
in a Solarian prison for life.

32:51.708 --> 32:54.291
I sure hope for everyone's sake
there's a "but" coming.

32:58.791 --> 33:02.208
I'm pretty sure you're the only one
who can get my friend's magic back.

33:14.250 --> 33:15.833
And what's that worth to you?

33:23.541 --> 33:25.791
Creepy old book for a lifetime of magic.

33:26.291 --> 33:28.166
Wonder who's getting
the raw end of that deal.

33:31.750 --> 33:33.333
You can't get it back, can you?

33:36.250 --> 33:37.375
Hm?

33:37.875 --> 33:40.625
Counteroffer. Give me the book
and I'll tell you how.

33:40.708 --> 33:42.500
Knowledge for knowledge. Seem fair?

33:43.291 --> 33:44.250
I will say this.

33:44.333 --> 33:48.041
Of all the information I have,
that is probably the least interesting.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.541
I know a lot of shit, Bloom.

33:52.166 --> 33:54.458
A lot of shit about you.

33:56.666 --> 33:58.666
Sure you don't wanna know that instead?

34:03.166 --> 34:05.166
Tell me how to get her magic back.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.166
Selfless.

34:09.416 --> 34:10.458
I'm impressed.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.708
Funny thing is

34:13.625 --> 34:15.416
all your answers are in here.

34:18.333 --> 34:19.416
You can read it?

34:20.000 --> 34:20.958
Of course.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.583
Oh, right, yeah. I pretended I couldn't.

34:24.375 --> 34:25.666
That was fun.

34:26.166 --> 34:29.083
No, this is actually my dad's book.

34:29.166 --> 34:31.375
Well, it was, before he died.

34:32.125 --> 34:34.250
He used to collect Blood Witch relics.

34:34.333 --> 34:37.041
We had so much cool shit around the house.

34:38.166 --> 34:39.708
Shame it got vaporized.

34:42.625 --> 34:45.583
-You're from Aster Dell.
-I am.

34:46.416 --> 34:47.625
It's how I know about you.

34:49.375 --> 34:51.875
My dad was obsessed with the Dragon Flame.

34:53.541 --> 34:58.666
But that's not what we're talking about.
No, we're talking about Musa's magic.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.833
Two ways to get it back.

35:05.416 --> 35:08.125
Option one, reverse the process.

35:08.208 --> 35:10.333
Basically, get a scraper
to take it from me

35:10.416 --> 35:11.541
and give it back to her.

35:12.583 --> 35:14.416
It'd take a lot for me to agree to that.

35:15.125 --> 35:16.125
Option two.

35:17.375 --> 35:18.375
Kill me.

35:19.666 --> 35:21.791
Then everyone gets their magic back.

35:23.041 --> 35:25.958
Why does that feel like information
you wouldn't want me to have?

35:26.041 --> 35:27.166
We had a deal.

35:29.500 --> 35:30.583
Also…

35:32.458 --> 35:34.541
are you really willing to kill me, Bloom?

35:41.250 --> 35:43.041
Seems we're at an impasse, then.

35:47.666 --> 35:49.333
Pleasure doing business with you.

35:51.125 --> 35:52.416
Anything else?

35:58.583 --> 35:59.916
No, that's it.

36:05.083 --> 36:07.750
-<i>Do not sit down with him.</i>
-Too late. I already did.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.791
Oh. And?

36:10.791 --> 36:13.500
Well, he told me
how to get Musa's magic back.

36:13.583 --> 36:16.000
Either he gives it back or we kill him.

36:16.791 --> 36:17.791
Not ideal.

36:18.583 --> 36:19.708
But at least we know.

36:20.416 --> 36:21.833
<i>Are you on your way back?</i>

36:21.916 --> 36:24.375
I wonder if there's something else
I can give him.

36:24.458 --> 36:26.458
Your magic is supercharged right now.

36:26.541 --> 36:27.416
What?

36:27.500 --> 36:30.916
The convergence ceremony messed with it.
It happened to all of us.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.833
Get back here and discharge it
so you don't lose control.

36:33.916 --> 36:35.708
I was just in there, Aisha. I'm fine.

36:35.791 --> 36:39.000
<i>-I can handle my magic.</i>
-Just come home, please.

36:40.250 --> 36:42.333
I'm fine. Promise.

36:47.166 --> 36:48.666
We've got a problem.

36:52.750 --> 36:53.916
Let's take a walk.

36:55.625 --> 36:57.625
Uh… I'll get the bill.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.041
You were drunk, weren't you?

37:06.791 --> 37:07.875
Last night.

37:08.708 --> 37:10.250
That's why you don't remember.

37:11.750 --> 37:14.458
Apparently, Grey found me
passed out in the East Wing.

37:16.375 --> 37:17.833
So, are you gonna lecture me?

37:18.583 --> 37:19.583
No.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.875
You know, when I thought
I'd killed Andreas,

37:24.958 --> 37:26.958
I got drunk for two years straight.

37:28.541 --> 37:29.541
Yeah.

37:30.583 --> 37:32.041
You were just a baby then.

37:33.083 --> 37:36.833
But then you got older,
and I realized I had a job to do.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.916
I'm still here, Sky.
Still trying to do that job.

37:43.750 --> 37:45.333
Look, I can't train.

37:46.291 --> 37:49.708
-Every time I pick up my sword, I am--
-Back there. I know.

37:49.791 --> 37:51.708
It will pass.

37:51.791 --> 37:54.541
It's gonna take time
and it's not gonna to be easy,

37:54.625 --> 37:56.916
but when you need to fight,
you will fight.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.583
-You'll push through. It's what we do.

38:02.791 --> 38:07.583
I was so, so nearly there with Andreas.

38:08.333 --> 38:09.666
I thought there'd be…

38:11.500 --> 38:12.916
some kind of redemption.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.291
I might have a future with him.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.125
You see, that's your problem.

38:21.416 --> 38:23.250
You try to predict your future.

38:24.291 --> 38:25.708
We're soldiers, Sky.

38:26.416 --> 38:28.500
-We don't get to do that.

38:29.416 --> 38:31.208
I'm sorry, Silva. That's fucked up.

38:31.291 --> 38:35.791
Yes, life's fucked up. And guess what?
It doesn't give a shit about your plans.

38:36.291 --> 38:39.875
But if you can come to terms with that,
you become unshakable.

38:40.541 --> 38:43.125
All the great fighters
are unshakable, Sky.

38:44.750 --> 38:48.625
So, I just… go through life
in a constant state of uncertainty?

38:50.416 --> 38:51.791
Readiness.

38:52.958 --> 38:54.708
You see, that may work for you.

38:57.541 --> 38:59.666
I'm not sure that's the life I wanna live.

39:06.250 --> 39:07.708
Oi! Get a bloody room.

39:07.791 --> 39:08.875
Fuck off, Craig.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.000
They hate us, don't they?

39:14.083 --> 39:15.291
Well, of course they do.

39:16.041 --> 39:19.791
We're sitting in the middle of the track.
It's obnoxious.

39:22.375 --> 39:23.208
What?

39:25.416 --> 39:28.458
It's just that I can see
that they hate us,

39:28.958 --> 39:32.083
but you have no idea how nice it is
that I can't hear it.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.375
Terra is on her way back.

39:42.583 --> 39:47.000
She's not kidding, you know.
She won't stop until you get it back.

39:48.250 --> 39:50.208
What am I supposed to do about it?

39:51.583 --> 39:52.625
Tell her the truth.

39:53.583 --> 39:55.666
-What do you mean?
-Come on, Musa.

39:57.041 --> 39:58.541
I know what happened.

40:00.333 --> 40:02.041
I lied before.

40:03.041 --> 40:04.458
You weren't unconscious.

40:07.791 --> 40:10.333
I got there a few seconds
before you were attacked.

40:11.416 --> 40:12.625
I saw you come out.

40:14.208 --> 40:16.875
I saw you… give it up.

40:24.750 --> 40:28.375
Look, I would've stopped you,
but I got attacked myself,

40:28.458 --> 40:32.291
and by the time I fought them off,
it was over.

40:36.666 --> 40:38.875
You have no idea how hard it's been.

40:39.375 --> 40:42.375
-My whole life, I've--
-Of course I don't.

40:42.458 --> 40:43.875
Nobody does.

40:44.875 --> 40:46.458
Your life is your life.

40:47.666 --> 40:49.458
You can live it how you want.

40:49.541 --> 40:51.166
Fuck everybody else.

40:52.958 --> 40:54.250
The thing is

40:55.458 --> 40:57.750
I'm pretty sure
people will understand that.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.041
I don't know if they will.

41:04.625 --> 41:06.708
-Ready for extraction?
-Don't tell anyone.

41:06.791 --> 41:10.041
We'd better hurry.
Got a bit of a situation with Bloom.

41:10.541 --> 41:12.916
They're in the First World.
I just don't know where.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.791
-And what would you like me to do?
-Find her.

41:15.875 --> 41:17.375
Stop her, maybe.

41:17.458 --> 41:20.125
Probably a bit late for that,
don't you think?

41:21.250 --> 41:24.250
Well, we have to try.
If she loses her temper, she could--

41:24.333 --> 41:26.041
She'll kill him, yes.

41:27.458 --> 41:31.375
-The Otherworld will be a better place.
-You want her to lose control.

41:31.958 --> 41:36.083
Did you think Beatrix could take something
from my office without my knowing?

41:37.583 --> 41:38.875
Or would?

41:39.500 --> 41:40.666
Of course she told you.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.458
The convergence crystal was a good idea.

41:44.375 --> 41:48.291
If Bloom keeps her cool,
I'll give that pathway a look.

41:49.291 --> 41:51.625
But something tells me I won't need to.

41:52.291 --> 41:53.583
Bloom isn't a killer.

41:53.666 --> 41:55.916
I suppose we'll see about that.

41:59.916 --> 42:02.250
Less kitschy. More ominous.

42:04.250 --> 42:06.166
The question is, for whom?

42:07.125 --> 42:08.208
You or me?

42:13.750 --> 42:15.708
I don't wanna play games anymore.

42:15.791 --> 42:17.708
Does that mean
we're, uh, dropping

42:17.791 --> 42:21.375
the whole "I want
my friend's magic back" bit?

42:23.875 --> 42:26.125
Is that the only way they'd let you come?

42:26.208 --> 42:29.500
If, uh,
you pretended this was about her?

42:31.125 --> 42:35.500
Oh. Relax. I mean,
I'm not saying you don't care, but…

42:36.666 --> 42:38.166
we're all selfish, Bloom.

42:39.625 --> 42:40.958
You wanna know about you.

42:43.458 --> 42:44.750
And I could tell you.

42:47.833 --> 42:49.083
What do you want?

42:51.375 --> 42:52.833
For the great mystery?

42:54.458 --> 42:55.541
The holy grail?

42:56.916 --> 42:57.916
Easy.

42:58.833 --> 43:00.083
The Dragon Flame.

43:02.583 --> 43:05.916
Give it to me,
and I'll tell you where you came from.

43:07.458 --> 43:11.375
Plus, I won't need any other magic,
so I can give the rest back.

43:12.541 --> 43:13.791
Wins all round.

43:16.666 --> 43:18.166
And what would you do with it?

43:18.250 --> 43:20.875
Right the wrongs of Aster Dell.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.416
But I'm not gonna, like, kill all fairies
or…

43:25.500 --> 43:26.708
…destroy the Otherworld.

43:26.791 --> 43:30.375
I have zero interest
in using the Dragon Flame to start a war.

43:30.458 --> 43:32.458
That is Rosalind's thing.

43:33.125 --> 43:34.666
Rosalind doesn't want a war.

43:34.750 --> 43:37.083
That is all she has ever wanted.

43:38.291 --> 43:39.958
My dad was the same way too.

43:40.041 --> 43:42.166
Fucked-up peas in a pod.

43:43.541 --> 43:46.708
-They knew each other?
-Opposite sides, of course.

43:46.791 --> 43:49.541
Zealots obsessed with an ancient war.

43:50.416 --> 43:52.916
The Dragon Flame was the trump card.

43:53.708 --> 43:55.791
You were the trump card.

43:56.666 --> 43:59.500
And unfortunately
for every single family in Aster Dell,

43:59.583 --> 44:01.250
my dad found you first,

44:01.333 --> 44:03.125
he brought you home and…

44:04.041 --> 44:05.458
you know the rest.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.041
You mean your dad kidnapped me?

44:11.125 --> 44:15.458
No, I didn't misspeak.
He didn't kidnap you.

44:17.250 --> 44:19.083
He found you, Bloom.

44:19.166 --> 44:21.333
And what does that mean, Sebastian?

44:22.750 --> 44:23.833
Where did he find me?

44:23.916 --> 44:25.583
Okay, I'm sorry, the deal was

44:25.666 --> 44:28.833
you give me the Dragon Flame,
I give you your answers.

44:30.625 --> 44:31.750
Last chance.

44:47.708 --> 44:49.000
It's never gonna happen.

44:51.958 --> 44:53.541
Fair enough.

44:55.333 --> 44:58.208
But I'd hate for you
to go away empty-handed,

44:58.291 --> 45:01.750
so I will leave you with one juicy nugget.

45:02.708 --> 45:05.666
Not the secret you want.
The secret you need.

45:06.958 --> 45:10.125
Remember when I told you
I'd figure out what happened to Dowling?

45:13.500 --> 45:14.500
She's dead.

45:17.166 --> 45:18.666
Rosalind killed her.

45:19.958 --> 45:20.875
What?

45:22.291 --> 45:23.541
Unexpected.

45:23.625 --> 45:25.458
The info, not the action.

45:25.541 --> 45:27.958
The action is very Rosalind.

45:28.041 --> 45:30.083
-That's not possible.
-Really?

45:31.125 --> 45:32.541
-You don't think so?
-No.

45:32.625 --> 45:34.083
In the back of your mind,

45:34.166 --> 45:37.375
you can't imagine
that exact thing happening?

45:39.250 --> 45:41.000
You can dig her up if you'd like.

45:41.875 --> 45:43.041
She's buried in the graveyard,

45:43.125 --> 45:46.458
been there all year while you and Rosalind
were becoming besties.

45:48.875 --> 45:50.000
Sorry about that.

45:54.541 --> 45:56.083
Should have stuck with me.

46:09.958 --> 46:12.166
Luke, what's up, man?

46:12.916 --> 46:16.416
I know this seems a little bit sketch,
but, um, I really need a favor.

46:16.500 --> 46:18.708
I've got some weird family situation,

46:18.791 --> 46:21.625
and, um, I know that Rosalind
sealed the barriers,

46:21.708 --> 46:24.000
but I gotta get out of here.

46:24.083 --> 46:26.083
Is there any way past?

46:26.166 --> 46:27.416
Not that I know of.

46:27.500 --> 46:28.333
Don't worry.

46:28.416 --> 46:31.208
I knew it was a long shot anyway,
but thank you, yeah?

46:45.083 --> 46:47.958
You told us to call
if anybody tried to get past the barrier.

46:48.541 --> 46:49.541
<i>What is it?</i>

46:51.416 --> 46:53.500
And I'm just confirming our instructions.

46:53.583 --> 46:55.333
-<i>And?</i>
So we're all good.

47:01.500 --> 47:02.750
I trusted you.

47:04.041 --> 47:07.500
-I cannot believe you told Rosalind.
-You said it. You have to play the game.

47:07.583 --> 47:10.833
-Don't. This is not the same.

47:10.916 --> 47:12.541
You're right. It's not.

47:12.625 --> 47:15.291
If you don't play the game,
mummy doesn't talk to you.

47:15.375 --> 47:19.125
If I don't, Rosalind kicks me out.
Do you know where I go then? No?

47:19.208 --> 47:20.458
Me fucking neither.

47:21.958 --> 47:23.958
-Beatrix--
-I have nothing, Stella.

47:25.375 --> 47:26.833
Nothing and nobody.

47:27.666 --> 47:31.416
So do not be surprised when I do
whatever it takes to survive from here on.

47:37.166 --> 47:39.583
Aisha, hey. Um, did Bloom call?

47:39.666 --> 47:41.708
<i>Yeah. Rosalind killed Dowling.</i>

47:46.500 --> 47:49.083
-How did she sound when you talked to her?
-On edge.

47:49.166 --> 47:52.875
I told her she had to come to us first,
that we had to discharge her magic

47:52.958 --> 47:55.208
and we'd figure out
what to do about Rosalind, but…

47:56.166 --> 47:57.166
But what?

47:57.916 --> 48:00.416
Rosalind said
she's gonna meet Bloom at the portal.

48:11.958 --> 48:12.791
Rosalind.

48:15.791 --> 48:17.583
I take it you knew where I was.

48:18.375 --> 48:20.291
-Your friends told me.
-Mm.

48:22.666 --> 48:24.500
Glad to see you're in one piece.

48:25.416 --> 48:26.791
Were you worried?

48:27.583 --> 48:29.000
Not for a second.

48:29.083 --> 48:29.958
Mm.

48:32.416 --> 48:36.041
Is our friend, the Blood Witch,
in one piece as well?

48:36.875 --> 48:38.125
He is, yeah.

48:39.625 --> 48:41.541
I'm impressed with your restraint.

48:44.458 --> 48:47.541
Well, it's not easy sometimes, so…

48:50.541 --> 48:52.458
Sorry I didn't tell you where I was going.

48:53.166 --> 48:56.791
It was the savvy move.
He might have sensed something.

48:58.166 --> 48:59.875
Then the game would've been up.

49:02.833 --> 49:04.250
How did it go?

49:04.333 --> 49:06.916
I think he really believes
that I'll turn on you.

49:07.416 --> 49:09.500
Good. Good.

49:10.666 --> 49:14.125
My worry was you wouldn't be convincing,
but it seems I taught you well.

49:16.083 --> 49:18.416
You're more like me than I thought.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Does that bother you for some reason?

49:24.958 --> 49:26.416
That we might be similar?

49:31.416 --> 49:32.916
You seem different.

49:34.166 --> 49:35.208
Why is that?

49:39.333 --> 49:42.375
Did Sebastian tell you something
that's upset you?

49:44.875 --> 49:45.875
About me?

49:53.625 --> 49:54.541
Was it here?

49:58.000 --> 49:59.166
Did you kill her here?

50:02.833 --> 50:04.250
A little to your right.

50:07.083 --> 50:08.291
You're a monster!

50:12.291 --> 50:13.916
Oh, grow up.

50:14.500 --> 50:16.000
It hurts! It hurts!

50:16.625 --> 50:19.458
-I wanted to do this together.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.541
Plan A was glorious.

50:23.708 --> 50:28.291
Just the two of us powerful fairies
side by side.

50:29.083 --> 50:31.291
An example to the Otherworld.

50:32.083 --> 50:33.708
I'm nothing like you.

50:33.791 --> 50:35.125
You're right.

50:35.208 --> 50:37.791
So Plan B will be a little different.

50:50.750 --> 50:54.250
Did you realize, if you're in suspension,

50:54.833 --> 50:58.500
I can still channel
the Dragon Flame from you?

51:00.041 --> 51:02.583
Everything I wanted to do together,

51:02.666 --> 51:05.583
I can do alone.

51:05.666 --> 51:07.250
The uncomfortable truth is,

51:08.625 --> 51:11.541
if you really want to change the world
for the better,

51:12.458 --> 51:14.500
you have to be capable of anything.

51:15.583 --> 51:17.750
Sad you haven't got it in you.

51:19.208 --> 51:22.875
If you feel any better,
Farah was weak too.

51:48.708 --> 51:50.041
On second thoughts,

51:52.333 --> 51:53.666
maybe I was wrong.

52:15.416 --> 52:16.791
Bloom, what did you do?

52:38.291 --> 52:39.541
I lost control.
