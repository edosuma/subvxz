{\an3}Wait, what about that arrow
in Harvey's head?

18:30.042 --> 18:32.744
{\an1}- Oh, uhh,
that was Kratz.

18:32.811 --> 18:37.049
- Ugh, typical Kratz.

18:37.115 --> 18:40.452
{\an3}If only I'd have been there
to limit their portions.

18:40.519 --> 18:42.654
Or recommend
a healthy alternative.

18:42.721 --> 18:45.424
{\an1}- Hey, on the bright side,
no more life debt!

18:45.491 --> 18:47.326
{\an1}You can go
back to your family!

18:47.392 --> 18:50.829
{\an3}- I can't go back to my family
a failure.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.498
[sobs]
- Ugh.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.666
- Hey, can we go home now?

18:54.733 --> 18:56.768
- Buzz off!
Can't you see I'm mourning?

18:56.835 --> 18:59.238
- Geez Louise.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.206
- I'm a failure, Fee!

19:01.273 --> 19:03.742
[sobs]

19:03.809 --> 19:05.177
Why?

19:05.244 --> 19:06.178
- Foo, stop it.

19:06.245 --> 19:09.181
{\an1}- [groans]

19:09.248 --> 19:10.849
{\an3}- Foo!

19:10.916 --> 19:12.084
- I'm sorry, Harvey.

19:12.150 --> 19:17.256
I can't help it.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.857
{\an3}- Guh!
They're not dead!

19:18.924 --> 19:21.793
{\an3}- Uh. mo,
we're definitely dead!

19:21.860 --> 19:23.362
{\an3}Look!

19:23.428 --> 19:25.597
It's called rigor mortis.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.834
{\an1}- But if they're not alive,
that can only mean...

19:28.901 --> 19:30.335
They're zombies.

19:30.402 --> 19:31.803
both: Wait, what?!

19:31.870 --> 19:35.173
- [yells]

19:35.240 --> 19:36.341
- Fee, what should we do?

19:36.408 --> 19:38.277
- I don't know.
- Run!

19:38.343 --> 19:42.748
- [yells]

19:42.814 --> 19:44.616
- Rooter!
We're not zombies!

19:44.683 --> 19:46.485
We're not gonna eat
anyone's brains!

19:46.552 --> 19:49.254
- That's exactly what a zombie
would say!

19:49.321 --> 19:52.057
What the--who left this
sandwich here?!

19:52.124 --> 19:53.592
- Sorry, Foo.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.928
I didn't think this was
going to get so out of hand.

19:55.994 --> 19:56.929
Think we lost him, though.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.030
- No you didn't.

19:58.096 --> 20:01.633
[both scream]

20:01.700 --> 20:03.368
- Okay, Rooter.

20:03.435 --> 20:05.537
Let's just calm down--
Oh my!

20:05.604 --> 20:06.972
- Oh!

20:07.039 --> 20:08.574
[both grunt]

20:08.640 --> 20:12.210
{\an3}- The only way to kill a zombie
is to pop their heads!

20:12.277 --> 20:14.212
{\an1}- I guess we're gonna die now
for real.

20:14.279 --> 20:16.048
- I'll miss you, Harvey!

20:16.114 --> 20:17.349
- I'll miss you too, buddy!

20:17.416 --> 20:19.484
- Should we kiss good-bye?

20:19.551 --> 20:20.886
- I don't think we have to.

20:20.953 --> 20:24.890
{\an3}- Okay.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.559
- I--I can't.

20:27.626 --> 20:31.530
Even if you are zombies,
I can't hurt me friends.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.065
Go on!
Get out of here!

20:33.131 --> 20:36.168
Just don't eat the brains
of anyone I like.

20:36.234 --> 20:37.536
Kratz is fine.

20:37.603 --> 20:41.039
- Rooter!
We're not zombies! See?

20:41.106 --> 20:42.307
- We just pretended to be dead

20:42.374 --> 20:44.242
so you could go
see your family again.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.845
- You guys were trying
to help me out?

20:46.912 --> 20:49.915
- I'm just grateful you didn't
actually kill us.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.416
- Heh heh, yeah.

20:51.483 --> 20:53.919
Wait a second.
You almost died.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.955
{\an3}By not popping your heads,
I saved you!

20:57.022 --> 20:57.990
From meself!

20:58.056 --> 21:00.759
The life debt is repaid!

21:00.826 --> 21:01.994
{\an1}- It is?
Okay.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.061
{\an1}Yeah!
It is!

21:03.128 --> 21:04.863
{\an3}- Yay!

21:04.930 --> 21:08.033
- I feel like a heavy burden's
been lifted off me shoulders!

21:08.100 --> 21:11.370
And now my shoulder's
gettin' mad gains!

21:11.436 --> 21:13.672
- Congratulations, son!
- Dad!

21:13.739 --> 21:15.440
{\an3}- I know we weren't supposed to
see you ever again,

21:15.507 --> 21:17.843
{\an3}but I couldn't stand being
away from my boy.

21:17.909 --> 21:22.014
So, we've been tracking you
all day!

21:22.080 --> 21:23.415
- Nice camouflage, fam.

21:23.482 --> 21:24.916
- We watched as you saved
your friends,

21:24.983 --> 21:27.586
repaid a life debt,
and hunted zombies!

21:27.653 --> 21:29.187
I couldn't be more proud of ya.

21:29.254 --> 21:30.689
- Thanks, Dad.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.859
But I'm glad to be back
with my family, debt-free.

21:33.925 --> 21:37.162
Turns out living a life
of servitude isn't easy.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.064
- Heh, I know what you mean.

21:39.131 --> 21:43.835
But it also has its own rewards.

21:43.902 --> 21:44.703
All right, everyone!

21:44.770 --> 21:46.071
Let's head to home base

21:46.138 --> 21:48.306
and have some celebratory
family lunges, eh?

21:48.373 --> 21:52.344
[all cheer]

21:52.411 --> 21:54.980
- I sure do love
a good resolution.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.748
- Me too!

21:56.815 --> 22:00.786
{\an1}- 'Sup, nerds?
[chuckles]
