<i>There can be
no beginning without an end.</i>

00:58.990 --> 01:01.526

and understand</i>

01:01.559 --> 01:04.663

evaporated.</i>

01:16.909 --> 01:20.178
"Everything else
is masturbation."

01:21.412 --> 01:23.115
It just ends there.

01:25.784 --> 01:28.520
Yeah, I...
I need to find an ending.

01:28.553 --> 01:30.088
You hate it, that's okay.
It's all right.

01:30.121 --> 01:31.924
No! I didn't say that
I hate it! I don't hate it!

01:31.957 --> 01:33.925
No, you think it's too, like,
esoteric or abstract.

01:33.959 --> 01:35.361
Oh, honey, you're
putting words in my mouth.

01:35.394 --> 01:37.228
- Fancy words.
- I didn't say that!

01:37.261 --> 01:38.963
It's all right.

01:38.996 --> 01:39.965
What are you doing?

01:39.998 --> 01:41.200
Nothing, I'll just put it
where it belongs.

01:41.233 --> 01:42.767
What are you doing?

01:42.800 --> 01:44.502
What do you think?
It's trash.

01:44.535 --> 01:46.371
They're not gonna
fucking get it anyway

01:46.404 --> 01:48.373
because anytime
I try to do anything

01:48.406 --> 01:50.275
with any semblance
of substance,

01:50.308 --> 01:51.943
critics misrepresent it
completely,

01:51.977 --> 01:55.781
or members of my audience...
It's lost on them.

01:55.814 --> 01:57.817
It's like, you know,
it's the final issue.

01:57.850 --> 02:01.187
I'm trying to put a little bit
of medicine in the sugar,

02:01.219 --> 02:02.520
but nowadays
everybody just wants

02:02.553 --> 02:04.856
all fucking sugar
all the time.

02:04.889 --> 02:07.559
It's good, babe.
It's good.

02:08.226 --> 02:09.661
Like, good, real good?

02:09.695 --> 02:10.963
And you know
that it's good,

02:10.995 --> 02:13.599
but you're just spinning
right now, like you do.

02:13.631 --> 02:16.268
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay? So close your eyes.

02:17.935 --> 02:19.371
Close 'em and zip it.

02:19.405 --> 02:20.673
- Close your mouth.
- Mmm-hmm.

02:20.706 --> 02:22.208
Breathe through
your nose.

02:27.379 --> 02:28.915
Open.

02:30.381 --> 02:32.283
Feel better?

02:32.316 --> 02:34.386
- A little bit. Thank you.
- Welcome.

02:34.419 --> 02:36.020
And I know
I'm being dumb.

02:36.054 --> 02:39.225
I just feel like
this final issue of the comic

02:39.257 --> 02:40.692
could be, you know,

02:40.726 --> 02:41.927
my last chance
to show the critics

02:41.959 --> 02:45.397
that it actually
means something, you know?

02:45.430 --> 02:46.965
It's not just all the hype.

02:47.532 --> 02:49.768
I know. And it will.

02:54.540 --> 02:55.573
Thank you.

02:55.607 --> 02:56.976
Babe, is that all
you're bringing?

02:57.008 --> 02:58.410
'Cause, like,
I could've packed for you.

02:58.443 --> 02:59.644
I could've helped you.

02:59.678 --> 03:01.213
Yeah. It's, like,

03:01.245 --> 03:02.915
I don't need to change
my underwear every day.

03:02.947 --> 03:05.650
No,
no, that's...

03:05.684 --> 03:09.221
Um, we could also just shorten
the trip by flying.

03:09.254 --> 03:11.690
This is a road trip
that will be really fun

03:11.722 --> 03:13.691
and really informative
for my book,

03:13.725 --> 03:15.394
and I appreciate
your patience.

03:15.427 --> 03:16.728
That was more like...

03:16.762 --> 03:18.030
You know,
when I sold it to the team,

03:18.062 --> 03:20.198
I was talking more about,
like, finding the people

03:20.232 --> 03:23.235
in places that inspire
the number one R-rated comic

03:23.268 --> 03:24.537
in the genre.

03:24.570 --> 03:27.739
Okay, I'm literally
going to smack you.

03:27.773 --> 03:29.341
- Mmm-hmm.
- I said be supportive,

03:29.374 --> 03:30.508
not be sarcastic.

03:30.542 --> 03:32.378
You stop giving
me suggestions

03:32.411 --> 03:35.347
and focus
on planning our vacation

03:35.380 --> 03:36.649
for when you're
out of a job.

03:36.681 --> 03:38.483
- Oh, perfect, I did.
- Yeah?

03:38.517 --> 03:39.685
Vacation time awaits,
right now.

03:39.718 --> 03:40.752
- Yeah?
- Yeah,

03:40.786 --> 03:42.588
we get out of the house,
hit the road,

03:42.620 --> 03:43.988
- look at the scenery...
- Mmm. Yeah?

03:44.022 --> 03:45.558
You know? Yeah.
Do some, like,

03:45.590 --> 03:47.091
kinky stuff in the back
while they drive...

03:47.125 --> 03:48.794
Yeah, but this isn't
our vacation, honey,

03:48.827 --> 03:50.496
I don't want, um,
Ezra and Aurora there.

03:50.529 --> 03:51.930
Oh, I thought
this was the vacation.

03:51.964 --> 03:53.165
No, no, no, no, no,
I want something nice just us.

03:53.197 --> 03:55.300
Oh, we'll get some time
in the motel on the road.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.635
We'll see
if the bed springs work.

03:57.668 --> 04:00.106
They're here.

04:00.839 --> 04:02.041
A romantic getaway

04:02.073 --> 04:05.077
with your business partner
and assistant.

04:05.109 --> 04:08.346
Come on, hubba-hubba!
"Hubba-hubba"?

04:08.380 --> 04:09.548
We should
probably get out there.

04:09.581 --> 04:10.782
- We gotta break this up.
- Ooh, bless him.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.320
- Let's do it!
- Yeah, let's go!

04:19.991 --> 04:21.091
<i>So, the Slasherman,</i>

04:21.125 --> 04:22.962
<i>he's actually based
on a real guy.</i>

04:22.995 --> 04:24.430
<i>Some of our listeners
may remember, is that right?</i>

04:24.462 --> 04:25.864
<i>Inspired. Inspired by</i>

04:25.897 --> 04:27.499
<i>the I-90 murderer,
that's right.</i>

04:27.533 --> 04:30.836
<i>That's right. From 1987-91,</i>

04:30.868 --> 04:33.037
<i>there were
six vicious murders,</i>

04:33.070 --> 04:34.739
<i>there were over
a dozen disappearances.</i>

04:34.772 --> 04:37.775
<i>All within the same
200-mile stretch of I-90.</i>

04:37.808 --> 04:39.410
<i>You know, our hero</i>

04:39.444 --> 04:42.848
<i>is the serial killer himself.</i>

04:42.880 --> 04:45.683
<i>That kind of protagonist,
that kind of character</i>

04:45.716 --> 04:47.820
<i>needs a special
kind of ending. So, I...</i>

04:47.853 --> 04:49.288
<i>For the final issue,
I'm gonna be honest</i>

04:49.320 --> 04:53.091
<i>with you and your listeners,
I haven't found my ending yet.</i>

06:39.531 --> 06:40.733
Okay, itinerary.

06:40.765 --> 06:42.467
We, uh...
First up on the docket,

06:42.500 --> 06:45.703
we have, um...
Oh, Jesus Christ.

06:45.736 --> 06:48.673
- Fuckin' hell, Aurora.
- Um, we have, uh...

06:48.707 --> 06:51.209
Put eyes
on the road. Please.

06:51.243 --> 06:52.711
- Yep, got it.
- Want me to do it?

06:52.743 --> 06:54.178
Nope, it's good.
Got it. Um...

06:54.212 --> 06:55.913
It's a test,
this is a test.

06:55.947 --> 06:57.149
All my assistants
have to do this.

06:57.182 --> 06:58.717
- Uh, so we got a...
- 'Kay, listen up.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.519
We got a quick pit stop
in McBain,

07:00.551 --> 07:03.821
and then, um,
we are headed,

07:03.854 --> 07:06.457
uh, to that... To that
radio show with the guy

07:06.490 --> 07:07.959
who would
not stop, uh,

07:07.993 --> 07:09.528
harassing me about
getting an interview.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.762
He sounds like
a real fanboy.

07:10.796 --> 07:11.997
I think he's gonna be
pretty psyched

07:12.029 --> 07:13.498
to see you
and me, Todd.

07:13.531 --> 07:15.067
Yeah, both of us, huh?

07:15.099 --> 07:16.367
Uh, well, I don't know.

07:16.401 --> 07:18.671
You know, he might...
He might wanna be psyched

07:18.704 --> 07:20.105
to hear, uh,
the story of

07:20.137 --> 07:22.306
a successful independent
comic book publisher.

07:22.339 --> 07:24.709
Oh, I thought you said
he might talk to you.

07:24.743 --> 07:27.312
Oh, fucking guy.

07:27.344 --> 07:29.947
Finish your fucking comic.
How about that?

07:29.981 --> 07:31.850
You come off a little
bit as like a huckster

07:31.882 --> 07:33.084
when you...
When you start.

07:33.118 --> 07:34.653
"I'm the investor,
I'm the...

07:34.685 --> 07:36.954
- I know you meant that...
- "...small business owner."

07:36.988 --> 07:38.891
You meant that
as an insult,

07:38.923 --> 07:40.659
except for huckster's
the nicest thing

07:40.692 --> 07:42.026
anyone's said about me
in months.

07:42.060 --> 07:44.296
What else
you got there, Aurora?

07:44.329 --> 07:46.799
So, then we just have
that one comic signing

07:46.832 --> 07:49.201
at that store
Mangopolis in Albany,

07:49.233 --> 07:51.402
and then we're off to the
Big Apple for the convention.

07:51.435 --> 07:52.370
That's a big one.

07:52.404 --> 07:53.772
How 'bout accommodations,
are we stayin'?

07:53.805 --> 07:55.207
I emailed you
three weeks ago.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.942
- It's fine, Ezra, it's fine.
- Okay, all right, all right.

07:56.974 --> 07:59.410
I learned to stop opening
your emails ages ago.

07:59.444 --> 08:00.546
Oh, for fuck's sake.

08:00.579 --> 08:03.148
We are staying
in all motels,

08:03.180 --> 08:05.116
they're all rural,
and they're all real.

08:05.149 --> 08:07.351
- Four, five stars?
- Stars?

08:07.385 --> 08:09.755
Like
a solid two-and-a-half.

08:09.788 --> 08:11.090
Stars?
Okay, there's no stars,

08:11.123 --> 08:13.224
no diamonds.
This is on the potato system.

08:13.257 --> 08:15.793
It's just three solid
fuckin' old potatoes.

08:15.827 --> 08:17.129
And they all have
the recurring theme of

08:17.161 --> 08:19.464
- 21st century western decay.
- Oh, my God.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.599
And thank you, Aurora,
for arranging that.

08:21.632 --> 08:23.067
I really appreciate it.

08:23.101 --> 08:24.870
I'm hoping this fucking
book research was worth it...

08:30.909 --> 08:32.376
What the fuck
was he doing?

08:32.409 --> 08:34.712
For Christ's sake,
don't do that again.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.081
You know what...

08:36.113 --> 08:37.849
I'm so sorry! I...

08:37.881 --> 08:39.951
I got it, I got it.
Stay right here.

08:39.984 --> 08:41.320
Motherfucker, I'm gonna
go have a word with him.

08:41.352 --> 08:42.953
No, no, no, no, babe.
Don't, please.

08:42.988 --> 08:44.455
I'm sorry. No.
It was my fault.

08:44.488 --> 08:45.858
- Kick his ass, Todd.
- No,

08:45.891 --> 08:46.992
don't go out there.
People have guns here, okay?

08:47.025 --> 08:48.227
We're not getting
out of the car!

08:48.259 --> 08:49.360
He could be crazy.
He didn't even try to stop.

08:49.393 --> 08:50.828
Yeah, well,
they don't fuckin' know

08:50.862 --> 08:53.065
how to drive, either?
Come on. Jesus.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.402
- Everyone's okay?
- Yeah.

09:00.238 --> 09:02.474
Okay.

09:07.211 --> 09:08.412
Do you
want me to drive?

09:08.445 --> 09:10.516
No, it's fine.
I just...

09:34.605 --> 09:35.773
Okay!

09:35.806 --> 09:37.942
All righty,
boys, lady.

09:41.278 --> 09:45.717
Whoo! Holy fuck!
Where the fuck are we?

09:49.621 --> 09:51.323
Oh, hey, bud.

09:53.757 --> 09:56.161
Toilets are
for paying customers only.

09:56.194 --> 09:57.796
Uh, we are lookin'
for gas,

09:57.829 --> 09:59.131
we have money,
that's no problem.

09:59.164 --> 10:02.234
Um... Do these things
have fuel in them though?

10:04.502 --> 10:06.839
Uh...

10:06.872 --> 10:08.373
- Okay, cool!
- All right.

10:08.406 --> 10:10.909
- You wanna... Thank you.
- Good.

10:10.941 --> 10:12.411
Well, this may be
a terrible idea,

10:12.444 --> 10:15.147
but I think I may have just
found my first interviewee.

10:15.180 --> 10:17.449
- All rural, all real.
- Yeah.

10:17.482 --> 10:19.651
Safe word is "help."

10:19.684 --> 10:23.956
Hey, um, wondering if I could
ask you a few questions?

10:23.988 --> 10:26.123
Are you familiar
with the I-90 killer?

10:26.156 --> 10:28.860
Do you have meth?

10:28.893 --> 10:30.728
Um, oh, yeah,
another terrible idea,

10:30.762 --> 10:32.430
I'm gonna go around to
the back of this gas station,

10:32.464 --> 10:34.967
hopefully just pee,
not get murdered.

10:34.999 --> 10:38.236
Or, you know, contract
some terrible disease.

10:38.270 --> 10:41.139
But if I do, lovely
working with you all.

10:41.171 --> 10:42.440
- Goodbye forever!
- <i>Adios!</i>

10:42.474 --> 10:45.176
So, um... So you're
from around here, yeah?

10:46.844 --> 10:48.546
An odd bird, isn't he?

10:49.446 --> 10:52.650
Holy! Shit.

10:53.584 --> 10:55.653
I didn't know places
like this still existed.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.124
Uh, what do they even
fuckin' sell here?

10:59.156 --> 11:00.626
Uh, pickled eggs.

11:00.658 --> 11:01.692
Yeah, but I mean...

11:01.725 --> 11:02.760
I meant...
Let me rephrase that.

11:02.794 --> 11:05.030
What do people actually buy
from here in the last...

11:05.063 --> 11:07.032
Nothing, apparently.

11:07.065 --> 11:08.633
Um, is any of this, uh,

11:08.666 --> 11:11.069
getting your creative juices
flowing, you know?

11:11.102 --> 11:12.271
All right,
give it a rest.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.238
This could be the scene
of a massacre, yes.

11:14.272 --> 11:15.840
Final issue startin' to

11:15.873 --> 11:17.408
fuckin' get into
your head now?

11:18.609 --> 11:20.645
- No. It's...
- It's my fuckin' job, man.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.714
It's coming, all right?
That's the whole point of me

11:22.747 --> 11:24.716
designing, you know, the
fuckin' road trip, all right?

11:24.748 --> 11:27.752
It just, like, tingle
stimulate some inspiration.

11:27.786 --> 11:30.488
Final issue inspiration
is the objective right now.

11:30.522 --> 11:35.060
Or conversely, it doesn't have
to be the last issue, buddy.

11:35.093 --> 11:36.560
It's the last...
We've talked about it, man.

11:36.594 --> 11:39.498
I'm fuckin'... I can't...
It's not healthy, you know?

11:39.531 --> 11:43.001
You don't have to wake up
in cold sweats and...

11:43.033 --> 11:44.335
Whatever it takes.

11:44.368 --> 11:45.937
I wish I wanted to eat
some of this food

11:45.970 --> 11:47.171
so I could make you
pay for it.

11:47.204 --> 11:48.906
No, none...
None of this is edible.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.242
Um...

11:50.275 --> 11:54.746
Oh, my God.
Look at this fuckin' thing.

11:54.778 --> 11:58.182
<i>Janked?</i> The fuck
is this supposed to be?

11:58.215 --> 12:01.118
Looks to me like just
a sold-out rack of <i>Slasherman.</i>

12:01.151 --> 12:02.421
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

12:02.454 --> 12:04.289
Oh, you know I'm thinkin'
what you're thinking, buddy.

12:04.321 --> 12:05.690
I think it's time
for a refill.

12:05.724 --> 12:08.960
Fuckin' right, it is.
We got a trunk full of 'em.

12:10.161 --> 12:13.632
Or we could maybe do that
the next town over.

12:13.665 --> 12:16.233
This is kind of...
It's a little bit much...

12:16.267 --> 12:17.536
- Nah, c'mon.
- ...for them, no?

12:17.569 --> 12:19.271
McBain & McBain.

12:19.304 --> 12:21.373
He lived here
when you were a kid.

12:21.406 --> 12:23.175
Even if you don't remember
those years,

12:23.208 --> 12:26.478
you still have every right
to explore this story.

12:26.511 --> 12:29.147
I would say
this rack would look better

12:29.180 --> 12:32.284
with our comics on it
than in its current state.

12:53.704 --> 12:56.541
- Hey! Jesus Christ!
- Oh! Shit!

12:57.175 --> 12:58.477
Oh, my God!

12:58.509 --> 13:00.411
You scared
the shit out of me.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.314
I'm sorry.
I was in the bathroom

13:02.347 --> 13:03.682
and then I was, like...

13:03.714 --> 13:04.583
Have you been in there?

13:04.616 --> 13:05.884
- It's fucking disgusting!
- Yeah, it...

13:05.916 --> 13:07.051
And I come out here
and like...

13:07.084 --> 13:08.453
What is this?
Why is this here, you know?

13:08.485 --> 13:10.121
- Like, that's somebody's pet!
- The smell, it's...

13:10.155 --> 13:11.289
Somebody's pet
is just lying here dead.

13:11.321 --> 13:12.590
And I don't get it!
I'm, like...

13:12.623 --> 13:13.791
You know what? Let's just not
keep looking at it.

13:13.825 --> 13:15.594
- I can't... Sorry.
- I don't what I'm...

13:15.627 --> 13:17.529
- Yeah.
- I look like I'm fucking crazy

13:17.561 --> 13:19.430
'cause I'm out here and I'm
drawing this fucking dog.

13:20.598 --> 13:23.135
Ezra told me that if I have
any ideas that could be used

13:23.167 --> 13:24.469
for the final issue,
then I should draw them.

13:24.502 --> 13:25.570
And I want
to prove to him

13:25.603 --> 13:26.838
that I'm more than
an assistant.

13:26.871 --> 13:27.906
I'm a good artist.

13:27.939 --> 13:29.507
But I have this thing
where if it's in my head,

13:29.541 --> 13:31.675
and I see that something's
just like fucking awful,

13:31.709 --> 13:34.012
I can't get it out of my head
unless I draw it

13:34.045 --> 13:35.914
and so, like,
I'm...

13:35.946 --> 13:37.381
I look fucking insane.

13:37.415 --> 13:39.550
No, no, you don't,
you don't. No, no.

13:39.584 --> 13:41.420
Todd does exactly
the same thing

13:41.453 --> 13:42.821
and way weirder shit.

13:42.853 --> 13:46.590
I'm sorry. Yeah,
are these for your book or...

13:46.623 --> 13:49.594
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, it's, uh...

13:49.627 --> 13:51.762
It's gonna be a book
eventually.

13:51.796 --> 13:53.732
Todd's told me a bit
about it. I don't...

13:53.765 --> 13:54.833
I don't know very much,

13:54.866 --> 13:55.834
- but, like...
- Yeah.

13:55.867 --> 13:57.269
It sounds like it's
gonna be amazing.

13:57.301 --> 13:58.603
Thank you. Yeah.

13:58.636 --> 14:00.372
It's like the true story
behind Slasherman,

14:00.405 --> 14:02.440
or something, right?

14:02.474 --> 14:03.541
- Todd tell you that?
- Am I wrong?

14:03.575 --> 14:06.044
Well, no, it's not...

14:06.076 --> 14:08.712
It's about Slasherman, but
it's... Peripherally, it's...

14:08.746 --> 14:10.982
It's, um, focusing
on the victims. Um...

14:11.015 --> 14:12.150
Oh! Okay, yeah.

14:12.182 --> 14:14.552
It's about giving a voice
to those who, um,

14:15.752 --> 14:18.790
- no longer have a voice.
- Fuckin' right.

14:18.823 --> 14:21.226
Yeah, so Todd did
the initial research

14:21.258 --> 14:23.995
and, um, now I'm going
a little bit deeper.

14:25.129 --> 14:26.330
Is that one
of them? Or...

14:26.363 --> 14:28.700
Yeah, this is
Henry Dunn.

14:28.733 --> 14:31.103
He lived around here
two decades ago.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.570
<i>Couple months
after he was murdered,</i>

14:32.603 --> 14:35.474
<i>his family just kept getting
these cryptic phone calls</i>

14:35.507 --> 14:37.508
for about a year or two.

14:37.541 --> 14:40.811
This is Ginny Adams,
she was seven years old.

14:40.844 --> 14:41.945
Oh, my God.

14:41.979 --> 14:44.048
<i>Last seen
walking home from school.</i>

14:44.081 --> 14:46.784
This is Victim Zero.
Belinda Cooksey.

14:46.818 --> 14:49.888
She was murdered
over Christmas dinner.

14:49.921 --> 14:53.291
She was a single mother,
active in her church.

14:53.324 --> 14:55.694
Why is it weird
that she's smiling?

14:58.729 --> 15:01.565
She looks helpless,
you know, 'cause...

15:01.599 --> 15:04.703
You know something
that she doesn't.

15:05.936 --> 15:08.039
She's about to be murdered...

15:09.239 --> 15:10.374
horribly.

15:10.407 --> 15:13.244
And she's
just helpless

15:13.277 --> 15:15.046
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

15:15.079 --> 15:16.348
Yeah.

15:18.148 --> 15:19.684
It's on the house.

15:21.219 --> 15:23.387
Guess everything's
comin' up me today.

15:25.924 --> 15:28.694
Can you get the fuck
outta my store, please?

15:36.800 --> 15:38.502
Good evening,
Jefferson County,

15:38.536 --> 15:42.339
you're listening to
WMXV The Eagle!

15:42.373 --> 15:45.176
I'm Gary Ressin and this
is <i>Heartland at Night.</i>

15:45.209 --> 15:48.412
Tonight, we have a one hour
special treat lined up for you

15:48.445 --> 15:50.882
as I'm joined by none other
than Todd Walkley,

15:50.915 --> 15:53.517
brainchild behind one of
the most successful

15:53.550 --> 15:56.454
R-rated comics ever,
<i>Slasherman.</i>

15:56.487 --> 15:57.656
How's life treating one of

15:57.689 --> 15:59.525
today's hottest
comic creators?

16:00.090 --> 16:01.493
Uh, great, great.

16:01.526 --> 16:02.993
You know,
we're just road trippin',

16:03.026 --> 16:05.095
um, getting ready to,
you know,

16:05.128 --> 16:06.197
try to promote <i>Slasherman.</i>

16:06.230 --> 16:08.532
I'm workin'
on the final issue, uh...

16:08.565 --> 16:10.067
Glad to be staying
in Jefferson County,

16:10.100 --> 16:12.336
found a great place to stay.

16:12.369 --> 16:14.104
Can't say enough
about my lodging

16:14.137 --> 16:15.440
at the Comfy Suites.

16:15.473 --> 16:17.209
It's pretty cool.
Good stuff.

16:17.242 --> 16:18.410
So, the Slasherman,

16:18.443 --> 16:20.111
he's actually based
on a real guy.

16:20.143 --> 16:21.779
Some of our listeners may
remember, isn't that right?

16:21.813 --> 16:24.049
From 1987-91,

16:24.081 --> 16:27.351
<i>you saw a string of six
particularly vicious murders,</i>

16:27.384 --> 16:28.986
<i>over a dozen disappearances,</i>

16:29.020 --> 16:32.023
<i>all in a 200-mile stretch
of the I-90.</i>

16:32.055 --> 16:33.123
<i>And in many of these cases,</i>

16:33.156 --> 16:35.859
<i>the victim's families received
suspicious phone calls.</i>

16:35.892 --> 16:38.128
<i>The killer
mutilated his victims,</i>

16:38.161 --> 16:40.364
<i>turning their bodies into
what I think looked like</i>

16:40.397 --> 16:41.766
<i>grotesque sculptures.</i>

16:41.799 --> 16:44.002
<i>The police never found
a witness or suspect,</i>

16:44.035 --> 16:45.270
<i>he just disappeared.</i>

16:45.302 --> 16:46.937
<i>These are the very qualities</i>

16:46.970 --> 16:50.541
<i>that lift these folks up
from men to myth.</i>

16:50.575 --> 16:52.042
<i>For some, frankly,</i>

16:52.075 --> 16:55.412
<i>heroes or heroic-like figures
in that they're untouchable.</i>

16:55.445 --> 16:56.880
<i>That kind of protagonist,</i>

16:56.914 --> 16:59.651
that kind of character needs
a special kind of ending.

16:59.684 --> 17:01.386
So I... For the
final issue,

17:01.419 --> 17:03.355
I'm gonna be honest
with you and your listeners,

17:03.387 --> 17:05.523
I haven't found
my ending yet.

17:06.523 --> 17:07.659
<i>And I presume
you must feel</i>

17:07.691 --> 17:09.526
<i>a certain sense of
responsibility then</i>

17:09.559 --> 17:11.796
<i>to get the I-90 story right.</i>

17:12.729 --> 17:13.931
<i>I'm not sure
what you mean.</i>

17:13.964 --> 17:15.367
I mean, I was just
going off a quote I have

17:15.400 --> 17:16.801
from <i>The Atlantic</i> here,

17:17.535 --> 17:19.003
"But every page drips with

17:19.036 --> 17:21.538
"Walkley's tired brand of
senseless violence

17:21.571 --> 17:24.175
"and morally bankrupt
teen angst.

17:24.208 --> 17:27.278
<i>"Slasherman</i> is nothing more
than yet another toxic element

17:27.311 --> 17:30.882
"of a dangerous culture
than lionizes male violence."

17:30.914 --> 17:34.018
Mmm-hmm. All the things
that are going on

17:34.052 --> 17:37.522
<i>with our culture
and my comic book's a problem.</i>

17:38.221 --> 17:40.091
Just got those in today.

17:41.526 --> 17:43.295
The guy who makes 'em
came by to fill up

17:43.327 --> 17:44.796
and just
gave 'em to me.

17:45.863 --> 17:47.931
<i>But is there
a legitimate concern</i>

17:47.965 --> 17:51.770
the cultural toxicity could
push the already unstable,

17:51.803 --> 17:53.371
those just looking
for a reason

17:53.403 --> 17:54.805
over the edge
into violence?

17:54.838 --> 17:57.341
I mean, crazy folks
are always gonna come up

17:57.374 --> 17:58.843
with an excuse
for their actions.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.744
In this case, he's not
killing for no reason,

18:00.777 --> 18:02.747
I don't suspect.
I think he's got a purpose.

18:02.779 --> 18:04.848
I think he's got
his purpose.

18:04.882 --> 18:07.619
I believe he thought
he was creating art.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.586
<i>And artists often do what?</i>

18:09.620 --> 18:12.357
<i>They think they need
to suffer their work.</i>

18:12.390 --> 18:14.325
<i>He thought
that as a true artist,</i>

18:14.359 --> 18:17.195
<i>he needed to
make others suffer.</i>

18:18.830 --> 18:20.365
<i>Instead of inflicting pain
on himself,</i>

18:20.398 --> 18:22.267
<i>he thought he should seek...</i>

18:24.401 --> 18:26.171
<i>the infliction of pain
on others.</i>

18:27.771 --> 18:31.608
<i>And, um, like so many
that rise and fall,</i>

18:31.642 --> 18:33.911
<i>he eventually
ran out of inspiration.</i>

18:35.145 --> 18:37.281
Art. Inspiration?

18:38.415 --> 18:39.784
Yeah.

18:42.519 --> 18:44.555
I have a picture
here, folks.

18:45.155 --> 18:47.291
This is...

18:47.325 --> 18:49.594
this was, Ginny Adams.

18:49.626 --> 18:51.128
Her and I
were really close,

18:51.161 --> 18:54.031
and then she disappeared
walkin' home from school

18:54.065 --> 18:56.133
right along I-90.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.776
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

19:05.809 --> 19:07.077
You know what
keeps me up at night

19:07.111 --> 19:08.747
all these years later?

19:08.779 --> 19:09.881
Just thinkin' about
what would have been

19:09.913 --> 19:11.615
going through her mind
right at the end.

19:11.649 --> 19:15.253
Right in that moment
she realized what was coming.

19:15.286 --> 19:16.688
Her mother
hanged herself.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.923
She couldn't take not knowing
who did it or why...

19:19.957 --> 19:21.059
Probably, never know,
you know,

19:21.092 --> 19:22.761
it could've been anyone
for any reason.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.829
Could've been your hero.

19:24.862 --> 19:27.098
That's not what I meant
by "hero." Hero is a...

19:27.131 --> 19:29.633
I could've said "protagonist,"
"main character."

19:29.667 --> 19:31.703
<i>It's a writer term.
Don't... That's what I meant.</i>

19:31.736 --> 19:32.804
<i>Well, I'm sure if you have</i>

19:32.836 --> 19:34.171
<i>no personal connection
to any of this,</i>

19:34.205 --> 19:35.874
<i>feel free to just pull
this stuff out of your ass.</i>

19:35.907 --> 19:38.643
<i>I mean a machete,
a Mack truck.</i>

19:38.676 --> 19:41.079
<i>Some type of vintage
welder's mask, come on.</i>

19:44.047 --> 19:45.182
<i>I mean,
the welder's mask</i>

19:45.216 --> 19:46.517
<i>was something
that connected to me.</i>

19:46.551 --> 19:48.386
<i>All right? It's a comic book.</i>

19:48.419 --> 19:49.554
A damn successful one, too,

19:49.586 --> 19:50.821
and if you don't enjoy it,
that's your choice.

19:50.854 --> 19:52.289
I'm glad I got you
some ratings though.

19:52.323 --> 19:53.624
That's...
That's cool for you.

19:55.258 --> 19:56.527
Okay.

19:56.561 --> 19:58.530
Oh, hold on there,
Mr. Walkley.

19:58.563 --> 19:59.797
Can't have you
leaving just yet.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.933
One more moment
of your time, all right?

20:01.966 --> 20:04.401
Now we got a call
from your first fan.

20:05.569 --> 20:08.373
Belinda Cooksey,
you're on the air.

20:10.874 --> 20:12.109
Hello?

20:15.078 --> 20:16.480
Hello?

20:16.514 --> 20:17.815
<i>One.</i>

20:19.049 --> 20:20.251
<i>Twelve.</i>

20:21.184 --> 20:22.686
<i>Eighteen.</i>

20:24.221 --> 20:25.656
<i>One.</i>

20:27.491 --> 20:28.926
<i>Twelve.</i>

20:29.526 --> 20:30.796
<i>Eighteen.</i>

20:32.363 --> 20:33.664
<i>One.</i>

20:34.931 --> 20:36.133
<i>Twelve.</i>

20:38.199 --> 20:38.269
<i>Eighteen.</i>

20:48.813 --> 20:50.348
Okay,
here's the thing.

20:50.381 --> 20:52.484
With cats,
I never have to know

20:52.517 --> 20:53.918
the temperature
of their feces.

20:53.950 --> 20:56.320
That is why cats
are the superior animal.

20:56.353 --> 20:57.354
And, okay...

20:57.389 --> 20:59.858
And you care about that
because, what reason?

20:59.891 --> 21:01.758
Because
I don't wanna...

21:01.792 --> 21:04.562
- Okay, cats' litterboxes...
- That's such a small little thing to nitpick about.

21:04.594 --> 21:05.662
I don't have to know.

21:05.696 --> 21:06.764
That's your deal-breaker?

21:06.796 --> 21:07.899
Cats are warm.

21:07.931 --> 21:08.999
Dogs are
unconditionally loving.

21:09.033 --> 21:10.267
You just don't
want to like them.

21:10.301 --> 21:11.503
They will never
hurt you intentionally.

21:12.870 --> 21:13.938
It's just because

21:13.970 --> 21:15.205
everybody likes dogs,
I think, and...

21:15.238 --> 21:16.440
- Cats are...
- You just don't wanna

21:16.473 --> 21:17.508
fit in with...

21:17.542 --> 21:18.877
- Adam!
- Yes.

21:18.910 --> 21:20.678
It smells
like weed again!

21:20.710 --> 21:22.046
You hate dogs!
You hate me!

21:22.078 --> 21:23.313
Yes, it does
smell like weed.

21:23.346 --> 21:24.382
Is that okay?

21:24.414 --> 21:25.816
Do you hate
sunshine and children, too?

21:31.922 --> 21:33.223
All right, there we go.

21:33.257 --> 21:34.592
Everybody good?

21:34.624 --> 21:37.295
Yeah, I almost
got my seatbelt on.

21:38.028 --> 21:39.329
- Got it?
- Yeah.

21:39.363 --> 21:42.868
Okay. Well, too bad.
She's lying, we're out.

21:45.199 --> 21:45.769
Here we come!

21:45.803 --> 21:47.071
That was a nice place,
eh, Hannah?

21:47.103 --> 21:48.940
- Oh, yeah, so nice!
- How was the couch?

22:10.361 --> 22:11.729
Light it up.

22:12.496 --> 22:13.665
Light it up!

22:13.698 --> 22:14.732
You're having a little,

22:14.765 --> 22:15.900
I don't know why
you're saying no.

22:15.932 --> 22:17.801
No! Excuse me,
no, no. I'm not, no!

22:17.834 --> 22:19.103
Meg's getting high!

22:19.135 --> 22:21.104
- No! I am not getting high.
- Meg's getting high!

22:21.138 --> 22:22.607
- Meg's getting high tonight!
- No, I'm not!

22:22.640 --> 22:24.441
Oh, my God,
don't be a child.

22:24.475 --> 22:25.543
Pass it to Meg.

22:25.575 --> 22:27.312
- No, I don't want it, no!
- Yes!

22:27.344 --> 22:30.081
I rolled this
especially for you, on your...

22:30.113 --> 22:31.882
Don't! It's not
a fucking candle!

22:31.915 --> 22:33.183
Did you...

22:34.084 --> 22:35.186
Oh, my God!

22:35.219 --> 22:36.420
You're fucked.

22:36.453 --> 22:38.455
Megan, do you ever get tired
of being such a fucking nerd?

22:38.488 --> 22:39.757
Excuse me...

22:39.789 --> 22:41.758
Hey, you cannot talk to me
like that on my birth...

22:47.731 --> 22:48.766
Fuck.

22:48.798 --> 22:49.968
What happened?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.035
It sounded like
we ran into something,

22:51.067 --> 22:52.202
but you weren't
on the shoulder though.

22:52.236 --> 22:53.403
And you didn't...
The wheel didn't get caught

22:53.437 --> 22:54.472
on the shoulder,
we didn't...

22:54.505 --> 22:55.540
What are you talking...

22:55.573 --> 22:56.608
...hit like
a rock or some shit?

22:56.641 --> 22:57.675
Why are you
narrating this?

22:57.708 --> 22:58.810
The car didn't
just stop!

22:58.843 --> 23:00.143
Is that
an engine problem? Is that...

23:00.177 --> 23:01.145
"Is that..." Do I look like
a fucking car expert to you?

23:01.178 --> 23:02.246
I don't know!
I don't know!

23:02.278 --> 23:03.680
Guys! We are in
the middle of nowhere,

23:03.713 --> 23:05.248
- we need to figure this out!
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

23:05.282 --> 23:07.051
Who's getting out? Are you...
Is anyone gonna get out?

23:08.251 --> 23:09.686
It's my fucking birthday,
I'm not getting out!

23:09.719 --> 23:11.922
- Just, fucking...
- Fuck you guys.

23:11.956 --> 23:14.225
I'll fucking do it
if you want me to.

23:19.462 --> 23:20.864
Fuck!

23:22.365 --> 23:23.468
Fuck!

23:27.537 --> 23:29.074
Fucking car is fucked.

23:32.476 --> 23:34.379
Come on, you fucking...

23:43.453 --> 23:44.655
Don't you
have a spare?

23:46.590 --> 23:48.860
Do you know how
to change a fucking tire?

23:52.196 --> 23:53.631
Hey! Hey,
someone's coming!

23:53.663 --> 23:55.432
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck, yes!

23:55.466 --> 23:56.568
Hey, we're over here!

24:03.140 --> 24:04.575
Hey! Hey!

24:07.844 --> 24:09.046
Oh, my God!

24:13.784 --> 24:15.253
Oh, my God!

24:25.362 --> 24:26.698
Hi.

24:26.730 --> 24:28.365
Why isn't he getting out?

24:43.146 --> 24:44.581
- What the fuck?
- Huh?

24:48.818 --> 24:51.155
Holy shit.

24:51.988 --> 24:53.924
Hi!

24:53.958 --> 24:55.994
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

24:56.594 --> 24:57.495
Um...

24:57.528 --> 24:59.830
Thank you! Thank you
for stopping for us

24:59.863 --> 25:02.999
but I just called my friend
and he's coming,

25:03.033 --> 25:06.603
so we're gonna be okay!
But thank you!

25:06.636 --> 25:08.539
Yeah.
We're good!

25:11.741 --> 25:14.045
Phones
don't work out here!

25:14.978 --> 25:17.014
No, no, no!
Ours works!

25:17.046 --> 25:18.149
Ours is working!

25:18.181 --> 25:19.349
You need one of these!

25:19.382 --> 25:21.619
She's gonna call right now
again, see?

25:21.651 --> 25:22.819
Yeah, man, we're...

25:22.853 --> 25:23.955
- Thank you so much...
- It's fine.

25:23.988 --> 25:25.856
- ...but we're good!
- Thank you!

25:25.890 --> 25:27.190
I'm calling again.
I'm calling again.

25:27.223 --> 25:29.493
Seriously, man.
We're really good. Thanks.

25:29.526 --> 25:31.296
Let's get back in
and fucking lock the car.

25:38.469 --> 25:41.171
Oh, my God,
what the fuck is going on?

25:41.205 --> 25:43.541
He's not fucking
gone yet. What the fuck!

25:43.574 --> 25:44.976
Why is he not going?

25:45.008 --> 25:46.209
He might
know someone in the area!

25:46.242 --> 25:48.378
He had
a fucking mask on!

26:17.775 --> 26:19.710
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

26:31.521 --> 26:33.323
Oh, my God!

26:50.841 --> 26:52.977
Please, no!
No, please!

26:55.312 --> 26:56.514
Oh, my God. Help me!

27:40.824 --> 27:44.094
<i>One. Twelve.</i>

27:45.028 --> 27:46.597
<i>Eighteen.</i>

27:48.598 --> 27:50.100
<i>One.</i>

27:51.834 --> 27:53.171
<i>Twelve.</i>

27:54.138 --> 27:55.573
<i>Eighteen.</i>

27:57.307 --> 27:58.375
<i>One.</i>

27:59.509 --> 28:00.577
<i>Twelve.</i>

28:01.511 --> 28:03.113
<i>Eighteen.</i>

28:07.151 --> 28:10.388
"I am he that liveth,
and was dead,

28:10.421 --> 28:13.391
"and, behold,
I am alive forevermore.

28:14.424 --> 28:18.328
"Amen, and have the keys
of hell and of death."

28:22.399 --> 28:23.534
...a lot of respect.

28:23.566 --> 28:25.236
No...
Yeah, absolutely.

28:25.268 --> 28:27.137
It's about...

28:27.171 --> 28:29.340
It's about
remembering him.

28:29.373 --> 28:31.808
Yes. That's the whole point.
I...

28:32.809 --> 28:33.877
Okay.

28:35.411 --> 28:37.882
Yes! Okay, I... I look forward
to meeting you.

28:37.914 --> 28:42.119
Um... And thank you so much,
this means the world to me.

28:42.619 --> 28:45.222
Okay. Okay. Bye.

28:47.524 --> 28:50.393
That, um, that was
Henry Dunn's sister,

28:50.427 --> 28:54.165
and she agreed to me
interviewing her in New York.

28:55.098 --> 28:56.400
Awesome.

28:56.767 --> 28:58.568
Wow. Wow.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.505
- It's a big deal. Um...
- Yeah.

29:01.537 --> 29:02.538
It's a big deal.

29:02.573 --> 29:05.508
No, I've just been writing
to her and I was afraid

29:05.542 --> 29:06.644
that she was just
going to shut me down,

29:06.677 --> 29:09.480
thinking I was trying
to exploit her, but...

29:09.513 --> 29:11.882
Yeah... Just don't tell her
you're with me.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.118
I feel like

29:15.151 --> 29:16.319
you should have
got an interview

29:16.353 --> 29:18.823
with Reston yesterday,
too, he's...

29:18.855 --> 29:20.724
in a similar camp,
you know?

29:21.392 --> 29:23.995
Close to the victim

29:24.027 --> 29:26.262
and really pissed at me,
but, like,

29:26.296 --> 29:28.199
he's got insight,
you know?

29:29.065 --> 29:30.233
If that's
the perspective that...

29:30.267 --> 29:32.169
Are you kidding me
right now?

29:32.201 --> 29:35.373
It's probably
aligned perspective, right?

29:35.405 --> 29:37.575
They've got...
were close to it...

29:37.607 --> 29:39.809
I come in here,
I have the best news

29:39.843 --> 29:41.612
I've had in like, months.

29:41.644 --> 29:42.946
- I mean, I've been...
- I know.

29:42.979 --> 29:44.114
You've been
working hard.

29:44.148 --> 29:45.449
Yes, I've been working
really hard

29:45.481 --> 29:47.084
and you literally make this
about your interview?

29:47.116 --> 29:48.418
Which, yes,
was fucked up,

29:48.451 --> 29:50.453
but how you could
draw parallel

29:50.487 --> 29:51.654
between the two of them
like that?

29:51.688 --> 29:54.325
They're both
close to the incidents.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.659
And they both have
a feeling about it.

29:56.692 --> 30:00.631
They're probably not
a fucking fan of my franchise.

30:00.663 --> 30:03.401
This book isn't
about you, so...

30:04.267 --> 30:05.737
Nah, kind of.

30:06.769 --> 30:08.405
Kind of is, isn't it?

30:10.140 --> 30:11.409
All the things
in the world

30:11.441 --> 30:12.642
that you chose
to write about,

30:12.676 --> 30:14.912
and the biggest fuckin'
critique about my work

30:14.944 --> 30:16.780
you've chosen
to hone in on?

30:16.814 --> 30:19.382
You shut your eyes to that,
you just...

30:19.415 --> 30:21.651
I'm doing my job!
But like I said in there

30:21.684 --> 30:23.386
it's not...
I'm not a nonfiction writer,

30:23.420 --> 30:25.189
I don't have to...
Every moviemaker,

30:25.221 --> 30:26.423
everybody that
makes a movie

30:26.457 --> 30:27.858
or draws a fucking
cartoon has to...

30:27.891 --> 30:29.226
Okay, but don't talk, please
don't talk to me like I'm him.

30:29.258 --> 30:30.594
Okay, I'm not interviewing
you, it's not fair.

30:30.626 --> 30:31.961
Well, it's kind of
blurring together.

30:31.995 --> 30:33.531
- It's blurring together?
- Yeah. You're a little bit...

30:33.564 --> 30:35.298
So, I'm like one
of your fans,

30:35.332 --> 30:36.633
I'm like one of your fans,
or like...

30:36.667 --> 30:37.701
What? No.

30:37.734 --> 30:39.403
He wasn't my fucking fan,
was he?

30:39.436 --> 30:40.971
- Here's what really bugs me.
- Tell me what bugs you.

30:41.004 --> 30:42.305
What really bugs me
is everyone

30:42.338 --> 30:44.140
talks about <i>Slasherman.</i>
Everyone talks about the murders,

30:44.173 --> 30:45.142
Here we go, uh-huh.

30:45.174 --> 30:47.377
nobody ever talks
about the victims,

30:47.411 --> 30:48.612
and those are the people
that matter!

30:48.644 --> 30:50.580
This guy, whether
he's a fucking pig, demon,

30:50.613 --> 30:53.284
piece of shit,
he went and did something,

30:53.316 --> 30:54.684
and now people
are examining that,

30:54.718 --> 30:56.786
people who... if things
happen to, sorry,

30:56.819 --> 30:58.755
I know I couldn't say this
in public, I'm not, like,

30:58.788 --> 31:01.459
I know it's an un... It's an
unpleasant thing to say,

31:01.491 --> 31:02.625
but let's not pretend...

31:02.659 --> 31:03.928
But you don't really
believe that.

31:03.960 --> 31:05.563
- I believe that people...
- I don't think you be...

31:05.595 --> 31:08.531
...watch and make things that
are compelling for a reason,

31:08.565 --> 31:10.500
not just a list of people
that things happen to.

31:10.534 --> 31:13.437
I'm highlighting
who this monster killed.

31:13.469 --> 31:15.338
- That's what I'm doing.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:15.372 --> 31:17.341
I'm not attacking you.

31:35.392 --> 31:37.294
Derek, what are
you telling me?

31:37.326 --> 31:39.497
What, you
can't find them?

31:39.529 --> 31:41.565
We shipped them
three weeks ago.

31:41.597 --> 31:43.901
Fuck, sorry,
Derek from Mangopolis

31:43.933 --> 31:46.836
seems to have misplaced our
box full of comics.

31:46.870 --> 31:50.040
What does it look like?
It's a fucking cardboard box.

31:50.073 --> 31:51.374
It's fine, though.

31:51.408 --> 31:53.776
I'm losing, Derek,
can you hear me? Derek?

31:53.809 --> 31:54.878
Fuck you!

31:54.911 --> 31:55.912
Maybe we don't go.

31:55.946 --> 31:58.182
- I fucking hate this guy.
- Hey, it's okay.

31:58.215 --> 32:00.151
Whoa, what the fuck's
all this?

32:00.183 --> 32:02.353
Hmm?

32:02.385 --> 32:05.088
Some kind of traffic stop,
is it an accident?

32:14.797 --> 32:16.433
Come on,
come on, come on.

32:26.809 --> 32:27.811
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

32:37.220 --> 32:39.155
Put that tarp down,
what the fuck!

32:39.189 --> 32:42.493
Get going,
move, now, go!

32:42.526 --> 32:44.594
I told you no pictures
till the road's cleared.

32:44.628 --> 32:46.664
Move, move, move, move!

32:49.333 --> 32:51.802
No partners,
no groups, please.

32:51.834 --> 32:54.337
We'll sign posters,
we'll sign pictures,

32:54.371 --> 32:58.475
we'll sign T-shirts,
we will not sign weapons.

32:58.507 --> 33:01.312
You saw
what those people looked like.

33:01.344 --> 33:02.947
Like the triptych,
am I right?

33:02.979 --> 33:04.180
- Yes.
- Don't.

33:04.213 --> 33:05.481
Wait, what do you mean
the triptych?

33:05.515 --> 33:07.218
- Nothing, that's...
- Sorry, what's the...

33:07.250 --> 33:10.120
I mean...
this is nothing to you?

33:12.221 --> 33:13.356
- Okay, let's...
- Todd!

33:13.390 --> 33:14.892
He's jumping
to conclusions, okay?

33:14.924 --> 33:16.092
That doesn't mean...

33:16.125 --> 33:17.427
He's just seeing
something

33:17.460 --> 33:19.162
- that isn't there, possibly.
- Really?

33:19.196 --> 33:21.198
I've drawn what,
a thousand kills?

33:21.230 --> 33:22.700
And once in a while,
one of them might

33:22.732 --> 33:24.567
match up with
something that happens

33:24.601 --> 33:26.904
in this fucking
crazy country.

33:26.937 --> 33:28.506
<i>What do you wanna know?</i>

33:30.774 --> 33:33.077
All kinds of bad things
happen to people.

33:33.110 --> 33:34.645
Bad men,
dead women.

33:36.145 --> 33:37.313
Belinda Cooksey,

33:37.346 --> 33:38.815
<i>she had a son who saw
everything that night</i>

33:38.848 --> 33:41.718
<i>and he was fucking
catatonic after that.</i>

33:42.619 --> 33:44.054
<i>Put in the foster care system,</i>

33:44.086 --> 33:45.823
<i>and no one around here
saw him after that.</i>

33:46.456 --> 33:48.792
Jesus Christ.

33:48.825 --> 33:52.763
Uh... Did you
fucking make this yourself?

33:52.796 --> 33:54.731
<i>Slasherman's</i> like,
my life...

33:54.765 --> 33:58.502
- My religion, I find it...
- inspiring.

33:58.535 --> 33:59.737
Look inside.

34:02.139 --> 34:03.540
Oh, my God.

34:03.573 --> 34:06.844
It's Slasherman's
truck with his kill studio.

34:33.703 --> 34:34.772
Yeah?

34:35.172 --> 34:36.172
<i>Three.</i>

34:37.274 --> 34:38.375
<i>Twelve.</i>

34:38.408 --> 34:39.543
Who is this?

34:39.576 --> 34:41.178
- <i>Four.</i>
- Huh, who the fuck are you?

34:41.210 --> 34:42.312
What?

34:42.346 --> 34:43.781
- <i>Three.</i>
- Who the fuck are you?

34:45.947 --> 34:47.050
Man, fuck this.

34:49.018 --> 34:50.020
Oh.

35:10.674 --> 35:13.777
It's the same voice from
the Reston phone call shit

35:13.810 --> 35:15.446
with the numbers.
It was the same...

35:15.478 --> 35:17.114
I'm not tripping, man.

35:17.147 --> 35:19.882
How the fuck did this person
get your number?

35:19.915 --> 35:21.951
He got it, all right?
It's the same fucking voice.

35:21.984 --> 35:24.053
It's probably
not that hard, honestly.

35:24.087 --> 35:25.489
And then, somebody lays

35:25.522 --> 35:26.824
the triptych out
all nice for us...

35:26.857 --> 35:28.325
Exactly,
so that's why...

35:28.357 --> 35:29.692
Let's go to the
fucking cops, man.

35:29.725 --> 35:32.028
- We need to call the cops.
- Go and... Tell them what?

35:32.062 --> 35:33.764
All right, that there's
a killer running around,

35:33.797 --> 35:35.666
re-creating murders
from my comics?

35:35.698 --> 35:37.100
And that we just happen
to have a binder

35:37.134 --> 35:38.102
of all the murder victims,

35:38.134 --> 35:39.636
like, I don't fucking
think so, dude.

35:39.669 --> 35:41.839
All right.
I don't understand...

35:43.272 --> 35:44.707
...what harm
it would do if...

35:44.741 --> 35:46.310
I don't wanna go
to the cops,

35:46.343 --> 35:47.911
I wanna go away
from the cops.

35:47.944 --> 35:48.978
We go to the cops,

35:49.011 --> 35:51.582
we tell them someone
cut your fucking hand,

35:51.614 --> 35:53.817
we tell them
about the phone calls.

35:53.850 --> 35:55.819
We tell them that
the crime scene looks

35:55.852 --> 35:58.355
very fucking familiar to us,
we just do it.

35:58.388 --> 36:00.123
In the morning,
we go to the cops.

36:00.156 --> 36:01.225
I don't know, man.

36:01.257 --> 36:02.326
Okay?

36:02.359 --> 36:03.494
I'll think about it.

36:03.527 --> 36:04.895
Okay?

36:04.928 --> 36:07.797
- All right, all right.
- All right, okay.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.225
Hey, how's your hand?

36:36.259 --> 36:37.327
Oh, my God,
I'm so, fuck...

36:37.359 --> 36:38.394
No, that's fine,
that's fine.

36:38.428 --> 36:39.663
- Cool, that's fine.
- I'm so sorry,

36:39.696 --> 36:42.165
I didn't mean to startle you,
I'm just, uh...

36:43.466 --> 36:44.734
- Yeah, uh...
- How's it going?

36:44.768 --> 36:46.103
It's okay.
Can I get you anything?

36:46.136 --> 36:48.906
No I'm, I'm great, great.
How are you?

36:48.939 --> 36:52.975
Um, I'm good,
yeah, I'm, um...

36:53.009 --> 36:54.044
And how are you?

36:54.076 --> 36:57.480
I'm, uh, yeah,
I don't know. Really?

36:57.513 --> 36:58.614
Just a little
freaked out.

36:58.647 --> 37:00.483
I'm sorry.
I was just, like,

37:00.517 --> 37:01.951
a lot of, um...

37:01.984 --> 37:03.953
It was just really horrible,
what we saw,

37:03.986 --> 37:05.922
and I'm just like,
kind of trying to...

37:05.955 --> 37:06.923
Yeah, I know.

37:06.957 --> 37:08.859
...deal with it a little bit,
but I'm okay.

37:08.892 --> 37:11.962
I'm just gonna...
I'll just probably go draw.

37:11.995 --> 37:14.064
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go do the same.

37:14.096 --> 37:15.865
Yeah, draw, draw.
Just kind of...

37:15.899 --> 37:18.734
- Yeah. Draw this shit out.
- Forget about it.

37:18.768 --> 37:21.805
Uh... But call me or text me
if you need anything.

37:21.837 --> 37:23.473
And I'll... Fuck!

37:23.506 --> 37:24.741
Jesus Christ.

37:26.375 --> 37:29.113
Phew!
This fucking day.

37:33.382 --> 37:34.718
All right, so...

37:34.750 --> 37:36.687
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Be careful.

37:36.719 --> 37:38.388
- Goodnight.
- Thanks, night.

38:04.180 --> 38:05.448
Hey.

38:05.482 --> 38:07.317
What...

38:07.350 --> 38:10.120
What's going on with you?

38:10.152 --> 38:11.788
Uh, me? I'm fine.

38:11.821 --> 38:12.890
- Fine?
- Chilling, yeah.

38:12.922 --> 38:14.957
Yeah? Really?
Because you don't...

38:14.991 --> 38:17.161
You don't really
seem so fine.

38:19.663 --> 38:21.265
A little edgy, maybe.

38:23.033 --> 38:24.969
Yeah, I'm having
a hard time, babe.

38:26.236 --> 38:28.272
I don't know.

38:28.305 --> 38:30.774
I don't really know
what's happening and...

38:34.544 --> 38:36.013
Um, but...

38:38.147 --> 38:40.917
I'm sorry about earlier,
you know,

38:40.951 --> 38:43.086
what's important to you
is important to me.

38:43.118 --> 38:46.256
Truly I, I lost sight of that,
I recognize that

38:46.288 --> 38:49.292
and I'm sorry.
Okay?

38:49.326 --> 38:50.160
It's gonna get better,

38:50.192 --> 38:51.594
we'll be done
with this whole thing,

38:51.627 --> 38:53.029
get the fuck out of here

38:53.062 --> 38:55.464
- and go home, you know.
- Yes. Yeah.

38:55.497 --> 38:57.934
And I promise
it'll get better, okay?

38:59.669 --> 39:00.904
Okay.

39:00.937 --> 39:03.507
All right.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.108
I'm gonna go in,
you wanna come in?

39:05.140 --> 39:07.209
Uh, no. I still got
a little work to do.

39:07.243 --> 39:09.145
- I'll be in in a little bit.
- Sure.

39:11.214 --> 39:12.516
I love you.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.852
Three, four...

39:50.319 --> 39:51.921
Three, 12...

39:59.428 --> 40:01.297
Uh, three...

40:03.533 --> 40:04.535
Three...

40:06.535 --> 40:07.570
Twelve...

40:13.877 --> 40:15.911
"And she shall then continue

40:15.944 --> 40:18.582
"in the blood
of her purifying."

40:45.774 --> 40:47.810
- Nice.
- What do you mean "nice"?

40:47.843 --> 40:48.878
Hour-and-a-half late?

40:48.911 --> 40:50.446
Do you have any idea

40:50.480 --> 40:51.882
how many fucking hours I've
been putting in this place?

40:51.915 --> 40:53.315
Do you have any idea
how many fucking hours

40:53.348 --> 40:56.219
I've just been standing here
waiting for you as per usual?

41:01.491 --> 41:03.994
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's what I thought...

41:15.705 --> 41:17.306
- Guess what though?
- What?

41:17.339 --> 41:18.874
Got a puppy for us.

41:18.908 --> 41:20.143
No, you didn't.

41:20.176 --> 41:21.678
- Yeah, I swear to God.
- Are you lying?

41:21.710 --> 41:22.745
Give me a kiss.
Yeah, no, really...

41:22.779 --> 41:24.515
- Why?
- It's like...

41:25.781 --> 41:27.151
You're trying to
make me feel better.

41:28.417 --> 41:30.686
Okay, I didn't get
a puppy. I got a gerbil.

41:30.719 --> 41:31.955
Oh!

44:08.176 --> 44:12.748
Yeah, um,
Aurora works for me.

44:15.285 --> 44:17.520
She's terrific. She's...

44:18.221 --> 44:20.657
Was, um, really helpful

44:20.689 --> 44:24.894
in a whole number of things,
uh, namely...

44:24.928 --> 44:26.663
With your comic book.

44:29.564 --> 44:30.633
Yeah.

44:30.667 --> 44:32.502
<i>Slasherman.</i>

44:35.738 --> 44:36.640
Were you with him?

44:36.672 --> 44:38.440
- I was passed out.
- You were passed out.

44:38.473 --> 44:40.509
She texted me,
I was passed out.

44:41.977 --> 44:43.145
You know
what she looked like...

44:43.178 --> 44:44.546
- Oh.
- ...when we found her?

44:44.580 --> 44:46.815
- I don't wanna, come on.
- No, you're gonna have to look

44:46.848 --> 44:48.184
because...

44:49.185 --> 44:52.089
Well, actually,
what we found of her.

44:52.989 --> 44:54.324
Oh, God.

45:00.696 --> 45:01.731
Ezra.

45:06.502 --> 45:07.837
Todd drew this.

45:09.839 --> 45:11.507
Todd drew it.

45:13.743 --> 45:14.978
And you let him do it.

45:15.011 --> 45:17.814
No, he didn't do this.

45:18.747 --> 45:20.149
He drew this.

45:21.750 --> 45:23.120
<i>Somebody did this.</i>

45:24.620 --> 45:27.357
You seen this
particular comic before?

45:31.227 --> 45:34.163
No. No.

45:34.196 --> 45:36.666
No? You read
a lot of their comics?

45:39.569 --> 45:41.103
Kathy, do you like
their comics?

45:41.136 --> 45:42.439
I don't. It's not...

45:42.471 --> 45:44.640
It's not really my thing.

45:44.674 --> 45:46.310
It's not your thing.

45:47.009 --> 45:50.781
'Cause it's really
gory shit.

45:51.881 --> 45:53.549
It's all
tortured women

45:53.582 --> 45:57.186
and bisections
and disemboweling and...

45:57.919 --> 46:00.189
Who comes up
with this stuff?

46:04.993 --> 46:07.430
- Todd.
- Todd.

46:09.297 --> 46:11.567
Our friend is dead

46:11.600 --> 46:15.338
because what came out
of your fucked-up head.

46:16.239 --> 46:18.308
That was in your head.

46:19.908 --> 46:21.277
<i>Girls...</i>

46:21.977 --> 46:23.446
<i>mutilated,</i>

46:24.247 --> 46:26.515
<i>bound up and tortured.</i>

46:29.185 --> 46:30.786
You know what?
That's why you can't come up

46:30.819 --> 46:32.622
with an ending
to your book.

46:34.457 --> 46:36.426
You have nothing to say.

46:37.093 --> 46:39.295
You legitimize
violence.

46:39.328 --> 46:41.565
You fetishize evil.

46:42.631 --> 46:45.234
And my life is in danger
because of it.

46:49.439 --> 46:51.074
Motel surveillance
cameras

46:51.107 --> 46:52.909
corroborate your story.
You're free to go.

46:54.509 --> 46:56.178
<i>We have to call
her parents.</i>

46:56.212 --> 46:57.347
<i>You're right.</i>

46:57.379 --> 46:59.715
<i>No, I just have
a fucking heart.</i>

47:00.882 --> 47:02.852
<i>Even if you
didn't kill this girl,</i>

47:03.752 --> 47:05.421
in the eyes of everything
I hold dear,

47:05.455 --> 47:07.623
you may as well have.

47:07.656 --> 47:09.992
<i>Your minds are all over
this mess.</i>

47:39.321 --> 47:40.756
You were supposed to go
this way.

47:40.790 --> 47:44.094
The other stop sign,
no, we were supposed to go left.

47:44.127 --> 47:45.762
Honey, slow down.

47:47.629 --> 47:49.665
No,
what are you talking about?

48:21.163 --> 48:22.565
What?

48:24.901 --> 48:25.935
What?

48:28.770 --> 48:29.605
What is it?

48:29.638 --> 48:30.906
Oh, my God.

48:30.939 --> 48:31.907
Fuckin' him.

48:33.176 --> 48:36.011
<i>Four. Eight. 35.</i>

48:36.044 --> 48:37.079
Is it
the fucking numbers?

48:37.113 --> 48:38.381
What do you mean?

48:38.413 --> 48:39.915
Those numbers
at the fucking radio station.

48:39.948 --> 48:41.383
- Four, eight, 35. Hold on.
- And then he called him again

48:41.417 --> 48:43.119
- at the fucking comics shop.
- What? What?

48:43.152 --> 48:44.254
Let me find it,
wait a second.

48:44.286 --> 48:45.421
Is it...
It's Bible shit?

48:45.453 --> 48:46.890
Why the fuck are you
reading a Bible?

48:46.922 --> 48:48.625
Because I found it before,
okay? Last couple ones.

48:48.658 --> 48:50.226
Why did...
Oh, my God.

48:50.259 --> 48:51.361
I think
there's a pattern here,

48:51.393 --> 48:52.828
hold on a second.
Four, eight, 35.

48:53.728 --> 48:54.964
He called us
from her phone.

48:54.997 --> 48:55.830
Four, eight, 35.

48:55.864 --> 48:57.466
He called us
from her fucking phone.

48:57.500 --> 49:00.136
Four, eight, 35.
There's no fucking 35.

49:00.169 --> 49:02.004
What?

49:02.872 --> 49:05.375
- What?
- What? What is it?

49:06.509 --> 49:08.178
- It's the fucking com...
- What?

49:08.210 --> 49:09.478
Year, issue, page,
it's the comics.

49:09.511 --> 49:12.114
- It's the comics.
- A year issue page?

49:12.147 --> 49:13.182
Remember,
at the radio station,

49:13.216 --> 49:16.252
he called, right?
And he said 1-12-18.

49:16.285 --> 49:18.321
Year, issue, page.

49:18.353 --> 49:21.491
- Year one, uh, issue 12, page 18.
- Okay.

49:21.524 --> 49:23.692
Take a look, take a look,
take a look. 1-12-18.

49:23.725 --> 49:25.727
- Oh, my God.
- What? What, what?

49:25.761 --> 49:26.829
What is it,
what is it?

49:26.861 --> 49:28.096
There's
the fucking triptych.

49:28.129 --> 49:29.298
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

49:29.332 --> 49:34.437
Um, the next one, the next one
was, uh, 3-12-4.

49:34.469 --> 49:37.739
Three... Year 3,
Issue 12, Page 4.

49:37.772 --> 49:39.942
Fucking, it's "The Gift."
God damn it.

49:39.975 --> 49:41.443
No, no, no, no.

49:41.477 --> 49:42.712
He's been telling us!

49:42.745 --> 49:44.013
He's been fucking telling us
what he's gonna do.

49:44.046 --> 49:45.281
He just called, when he called
and he said four...

49:45.314 --> 49:47.350
What'd I say
when he called? Four, uh...

49:47.382 --> 49:49.585
Uh, 4-8-35.

49:49.618 --> 49:51.520
Page 35 on, uh, year...

49:51.553 --> 49:55.257
Year 4, Issue 8.
4-8-35.

49:55.290 --> 49:56.325
All right, I mean...

49:56.359 --> 49:57.527
It's the fucking
"Wish You Were Here"

49:57.560 --> 49:58.761
thing with
the dead family, is the...

49:58.794 --> 50:00.096
Oh, no,
no, no, no.

50:00.129 --> 50:01.264
It's the fucking family...

50:01.297 --> 50:02.465
They aren't
all the fucking...

50:02.497 --> 50:04.633
There's a fucking family
ahead of us!

50:06.301 --> 50:07.769
It means he's fucking
watching us.

50:07.803 --> 50:09.005
Where the
fuck is he?

50:09.038 --> 50:11.373
We have to fucking warn them.

50:11.406 --> 50:13.408
Hey! Pull over!

50:13.442 --> 50:15.712
- Stop!
- Pull over! Pull over!

50:15.745 --> 50:18.013
- What do you want?
- Pull over! Pull over!

50:18.047 --> 50:20.183
- We'll call 911.
- Get the fuck away from us!

50:20.216 --> 50:21.918
It's not safe!
Pull over!

50:21.951 --> 50:23.152
Get outta here!

50:23.185 --> 50:24.587
Call 911! Call 911!

50:24.620 --> 50:27.489
Fuck, where the fuck
is this guy?

50:27.522 --> 50:29.858
Fuck!

50:31.294 --> 50:33.763
Oh, shit.

50:37.466 --> 50:38.835
Okay, we gotta go,
we gotta go.

50:38.868 --> 50:41.371
No, no. We have to help them.
We have to fucking help them.

50:41.404 --> 50:43.607
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck.

50:47.475 --> 50:48.877
That's fucking him.

50:48.910 --> 50:50.646
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, my God, he's got a gun!

50:50.680 --> 50:52.147
- Gun, he's got a gun.
- He's got a fucking gun.

50:52.181 --> 50:54.517
Call 911, call 911.
Tell a cop.

50:54.549 --> 50:56.518
- He's got a fucking gun.
- I'm calling.

50:56.551 --> 50:58.553
Fuck.
No, no, no, no.

50:58.587 --> 51:00.857
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm on Interstate 90,

51:00.890 --> 51:01.790
outside of McBain...

51:03.759 --> 51:04.861
All right,
there's a family,

51:04.893 --> 51:05.995
he's fucking shooting
a family.

51:06.027 --> 51:08.096
- Oh, my God.
- 90, Interstate 90.

51:08.129 --> 51:10.365
He's got a fucking gun.
We've got to fucking go.

51:10.399 --> 51:12.002
What the fuck
is he doing?

51:12.600 --> 51:14.136
Fucking shit!

51:14.169 --> 51:15.671
We should
fucking help them.

51:15.705 --> 51:17.973
Run! Now!

51:18.006 --> 51:20.409
He's fucking shooting!

51:20.442 --> 51:22.210
He's fucking shooting them!

51:22.243 --> 51:23.680
Fuck,
no, no, no!

51:23.712 --> 51:25.714
Oh, my God,
we gotta go, we gotta go!

51:25.747 --> 51:26.982
He's shooting, all right?
Just get here now!

51:27.015 --> 51:28.283
- No, no, no.
- Save somebody...

51:28.317 --> 51:30.520
There's a kid
in the back seat!

51:30.553 --> 51:32.321
He just shot a fucking kid!

51:32.355 --> 51:34.090
Get out of here.
No, no, no, no.

51:38.928 --> 51:42.964
Go, go, go, go, go.
No, no, no, no. Go, go, go.

51:47.268 --> 51:49.004
Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

52:09.892 --> 52:11.227
Ow... Oh, Kath.

52:12.460 --> 52:13.729
Kath. Oh!

52:16.031 --> 52:17.033
Fuck.

52:19.167 --> 52:20.769
Kathy. Baby.

52:22.303 --> 52:25.007
Hey. Ah...

52:26.609 --> 52:28.944
Sweetheart...
Come on, sweetheart. Hey.

52:29.879 --> 52:32.647
No. No, no, no, no.
Hey. Fuck off.

52:32.681 --> 52:34.083
Fucking get away
from her.

52:34.116 --> 52:35.118
No, no.

52:36.285 --> 52:38.254
Take me, take me, no.

52:38.286 --> 52:40.323
Babe. Babe. Babe.

52:42.123 --> 52:43.125
Kathy.

52:44.393 --> 52:45.628
Oh...

52:46.227 --> 52:47.229
Kathy.

52:48.029 --> 52:49.798
Ah... Kath.

52:50.332 --> 52:51.567
Hey.

53:24.399 --> 53:26.201
Hey, Kathy.

53:34.643 --> 53:37.980
Shh, shh. Okay.

53:38.013 --> 53:39.982
We'll figure it out, okay?
You got me, I'm right here.

53:40.015 --> 53:41.250
How are we
gonna figure it out?

53:41.283 --> 53:42.485
I'm right here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

53:42.518 --> 53:43.619
Why... Why am I...

53:43.652 --> 53:44.787
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

53:44.819 --> 53:46.922
I'm gonna get you
out of here, sweetheart.

53:46.955 --> 53:48.356
Oh, God!

53:50.459 --> 53:52.395
Oh, God. Ezra.
Oh, oh...

54:25.194 --> 54:26.196
It's not...

54:30.565 --> 54:33.368
Okay, okay.
We're okay.

54:34.136 --> 54:36.572
What are you doing?

54:36.605 --> 54:37.873
We gotta get the fuck
out of here.

54:37.906 --> 54:39.609
- Stop, just stop.
- Hey...

54:39.642 --> 54:40.942
Listen to me,
just listen to me.

54:40.975 --> 54:42.344
Don't fucking give up
on me right now, okay.

54:42.377 --> 54:43.712
Listen to me.

54:43.745 --> 54:45.680
- We're not okay.
- Hey, don't do that...

54:45.714 --> 54:47.717
He is going to kill us.

54:47.750 --> 54:49.285
Don't you fucking
say that right now.

54:49.317 --> 54:50.919
- Listen. Listen to me.
- Don't give up on me

54:50.953 --> 54:53.189
- right now, okay.
- Listen to me.

54:53.221 --> 54:55.457
Okay, listen to me.

54:57.026 --> 54:59.995
This is it.
It's over.

55:00.696 --> 55:02.531
- It's over.
- No.

55:02.564 --> 55:04.833
- Yeah, I, I...
- Mmm-mmm.

55:04.866 --> 55:08.337
Please just stop,
stop, stop!

55:09.638 --> 55:11.674
I'm so sorry,
sweetheart.

55:11.707 --> 55:14.544
It's okay.
It's okay.

55:14.576 --> 55:16.678
It's okay.

55:16.712 --> 55:19.215
I don't want
the end of my life

55:20.616 --> 55:24.853
to be panic and fear,
I don't.

55:25.821 --> 55:28.290
And...

55:28.323 --> 55:30.292
And it doesn't have to be.

55:31.593 --> 55:34.229
- Because you are with me.
- Mmm-hmm.

55:34.263 --> 55:37.100
And I love you
and we're together.

55:38.366 --> 55:40.835
- Hey.
- I love you.

55:40.868 --> 55:42.404
- Fuck that. All right?
- No.

55:42.437 --> 55:43.472
Nobody's taking you.

55:43.506 --> 55:45.908
All right, and you hear me?
Look at me, look at me.

55:45.940 --> 55:47.609
Take a deep breath, okay?

55:47.643 --> 55:51.480
In...
and out.

55:51.513 --> 55:54.216
And out.

55:54.248 --> 55:56.252
Now.

55:57.453 --> 55:59.788
You gotta get home.
You don't wanna die, right?

55:59.821 --> 56:01.156
- I don't wanna...
- You don't wanna die.

56:01.189 --> 56:03.825
- I don't wanna die.
- So don't, all right?

56:03.859 --> 56:05.694
That's all it is,
there's no choice.

56:05.727 --> 56:08.697
But I can't let you
fucking die. I won't.

56:08.730 --> 56:10.132
Okay, you live.

56:10.966 --> 56:12.567
Look at me, you live.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.236
Okay? Get up.
Up with me.

56:14.268 --> 56:16.571
Come on. Come on.

56:17.872 --> 56:20.776
All right, here we go,
here we go.

57:05.020 --> 57:08.056
Run, Kath.
Run, run, run!

57:08.690 --> 57:10.560
Go. Go.

57:11.759 --> 57:13.528
Don't... no.

57:19.701 --> 57:22.205
Run, Kath. Don't stop.

57:25.841 --> 57:27.210
Kathy!

57:28.343 --> 57:30.480
Kath! Kath!

57:31.145 --> 57:32.147
Kath!

57:33.948 --> 57:36.084
Kath! Kath!

57:36.118 --> 57:38.921
Fuck! Kathy.

57:39.821 --> 57:42.524
God,
get the fuck off me.

57:45.560 --> 57:49.064
Five. 12. 35.

57:57.906 --> 58:00.276
Why, you sick
motherfucker?

58:15.857 --> 58:17.493
I can't wait
to show you.

58:19.495 --> 58:21.096
Help!

58:21.562 --> 58:23.732
Help me, please!

58:23.765 --> 58:25.433
Help!

58:25.466 --> 58:26.901
Help me!

58:26.935 --> 58:29.337
Someone,
please help!

58:43.218 --> 58:44.920
Please!

58:55.531 --> 58:56.532
Fuck.

59:03.205 --> 59:04.273
Kath!

59:13.649 --> 59:15.317
Kath!

59:15.783 --> 59:17.252
Kathy...

59:19.453 --> 59:20.555
Kath?

59:23.491 --> 59:24.493
Kath?

59:26.227 --> 59:30.632
Kathy. Fuck, where are you?
Where are you?

59:41.210 --> 59:43.412
I won't scream for you.

59:44.111 --> 59:46.081
I will not scream...

59:47.783 --> 59:49.785
Fuck you!

59:51.520 --> 59:52.655
Kath!

59:58.359 --> 59:59.361
What...

01:00:01.997 --> 01:00:03.933

Five, five, five...

01:00:10.205 --> 01:00:11.507
No.

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.409
No, no, no. Fuck.

01:00:13.442 --> 01:00:16.312
34. No. No!

01:00:16.777 --> 01:00:18.547

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:08:38.345 --> 01:08:39.613
No, no, no.

01:08:40.148 --> 01:08:42.084
I got you.

01:08:42.983 --> 01:08:44.218
No, no.

01:09:32.267 --> 01:09:33.602
Our ending.

01:09:53.987 --> 01:09:55.890
I was going
to kill you, too, that night.

01:10:00.894 --> 01:10:03.297
But there was something
about that drawing.

01:10:03.331 --> 01:10:06.034
No one had ever
drawn me before.

01:10:17.644 --> 01:10:20.681
But you...
You saw something.

01:10:22.282 --> 01:10:23.218
You saw what I did

01:10:23.251 --> 01:10:25.354
and you saw that it was
fucking beautiful.

01:10:28.523 --> 01:10:29.892
Hmm?

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.962
You showed me
I could be something.

01:10:34.996 --> 01:10:38.000
You showed me
who I'm supposed to be.

01:10:47.942 --> 01:10:51.113
I've been reading your comic,
since the beginning.

01:10:53.614 --> 01:10:56.117
I knew as soon
as I saw it...

01:10:57.285 --> 01:10:59.086
You were keeping
my work alive.

01:11:01.688 --> 01:11:06.260
And I didn't feel
the need to kill anymore.

01:11:07.694 --> 01:11:11.765
But when I found out our
work was coming to a close

01:11:11.799 --> 01:11:15.203
and you hadn't
found an ending yet,

01:11:15.236 --> 01:11:16.738
I knew you needed me.

01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:22.310
So here it is.

01:11:24.178 --> 01:11:26.747
Our final... issue.

01:11:30.218 --> 01:11:31.720
Isn't it beautiful?

01:11:34.087 --> 01:11:37.058
True art is created
by inflicting pain on others.

01:11:37.724 --> 01:11:39.428
You showed me that.

01:11:41.828 --> 01:11:43.764
I inspired you.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.903
And now
you've inspired me.

01:11:51.238 --> 01:11:54.942
Together, we will inspire
so many more

01:11:54.975 --> 01:11:57.411
and they will never forget
what we've done here.

01:11:59.112 --> 01:12:00.281
Kill me...

01:12:01.549 --> 01:12:03.952
so the world
can see our ending,

01:12:06.254 --> 01:12:08.457
and know our story.

01:12:18.131 --> 01:12:19.300
Kill me.

01:12:38.586 --> 01:12:41.056
And together
we will kill the world.

01:12:44.325 --> 01:12:45.794
Help me.

01:14:08.943 --> 01:14:10.912
Fuck your ending.

01:15:17.411 --> 01:15:20.181
<i>There can be
no beginning without an end.</i>

01:15:22.582 --> 01:15:26.553
<i>There can be no darkness
without color and light.</i>

01:15:26.586 --> 01:15:27.921
<i>There can be no accidents</i>

01:15:27.955 --> 01:15:30.192
<i>without there first
being a design.</i>

01:15:31.024 --> 01:15:33.094
<i>Enter truth, cold-hearted,</i>

01:15:33.126 --> 01:15:35.529
<i>unforgiving, and specific.</i>

01:15:37.665 --> 01:15:39.434
<i>The closer
you look at anything,</i>

01:15:39.466 --> 01:15:40.969
<i>the less you will see.</i>

01:15:41.001 --> 01:15:43.303
<i>Eventually something
you know and understand</i>

01:15:43.336 --> 01:15:46.307
<i>becomes an expanding
myriad possibilities.</i>

01:15:49.042 --> 01:15:51.246
<i>Its original purpose
and reason</i>

01:15:51.278 --> 01:15:54.081
<i>all but completely evaporated.</i>

01:15:58.385 --> 01:16:00.455
<i>Truth is
the forced perspective</i>

01:16:00.487 --> 01:16:03.524
<i>that mutates
the abstract into reality.</i>

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:07.194
<i>Real art is born of truth.</i>
