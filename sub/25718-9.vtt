BASED ON THE WEBCOMINC
<i>MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY</i> BY KI MAENG-GI

02:17.428 --> 02:20.265
Why didn't you call me?
Have you been waiting long?

02:21.057 --> 02:22.767
-No.
-Let's go in.

02:31.901 --> 02:36.406
In a month, rent and half of utilities
are due. If you can't pay, you move out.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.659
I only accept money, not stuff.
We'll buy our own food, okay?

02:40.285 --> 02:42.579
-Okay.
-All right, then.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.916
I'll sleep here. You can sleep there.

02:47.959 --> 02:48.918
I'll sleep there.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.340
Sure, that's fine.
Now, here's some important stuff.

02:55.091 --> 02:58.344
Make sure all windows are open
before you use the vacuum cleaner.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.848
And separate the recyclables carefully.
It's important.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.228
The top shelves are mine.
The bottom is yours.

03:07.812 --> 03:10.064
If you must use my shelf,
label your container.

03:10.899 --> 03:11.858
And...

03:14.068 --> 03:15.653
What? What is it?

03:15.737 --> 03:18.364
Nothing. You're a bit different
from what people say.

03:19.866 --> 03:20.700
In what sense?

03:21.951 --> 03:23.494
You're a real nag.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.916
You'll also have to watch your mouth.

03:31.419 --> 03:34.339
Give me that.
Because my place isn't that spacious,

03:34.422 --> 03:36.507
you should lay it out like this.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.135
Then fold it like this.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.554
After that, all you have to do is this.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.097
You saw what I did, right?

03:44.182 --> 03:45.183
What else?

03:51.105 --> 03:54.359
Don't you think that guy likes Mi-rae?

03:54.442 --> 03:55.276
What?

03:56.486 --> 03:58.529
Now that she's pretty,
guys swarm around her.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.783
What? Who? That jerk?

04:02.575 --> 04:04.827
Why are you calling him a jerk?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.622
He's in Mi-rae's department.
I heard he's a TA.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.208
It doesn't matter. All men are animals.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.545
A TA should focus on guiding students.
How dare he have a crush on her?

04:14.629 --> 04:17.632
He's someone's beloved son.
Why are you talking ill of him?

04:17.714 --> 04:20.426
I'd love to have a son-in-law like him.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.054
A son-in-law? Did you say "son-in-law"?

04:23.137 --> 04:25.098
Mi-rae is too young to get married.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.224
She's still a kid!

04:27.558 --> 04:30.019
Okay, I heard you. Just drive carefully.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.437
Goodness.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.275
Where does he live?

04:36.526 --> 04:37.443
Close to Mi-rae's?

04:39.237 --> 04:40.613
Oh, dear.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.331
Who is it?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.250
Hey, Mi-rae.

04:54.752 --> 04:58.089
My mom wanted me to give you this.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.467
-Your mom?
-Yes.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.679
Take the containers. Come in.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.895
Make sure you tell your mom
that I thanked her.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.272
Okay.

05:15.523 --> 05:19.193
-You should put everything in the fridge.
-Oh, right.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.237
Let's see.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.579
Hey, what are you doing here?

05:29.662 --> 05:31.122
I live here now.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.418
What?

05:41.007 --> 05:44.135
I posted about looking for a roommate,
and he showed up.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.553
He practically begged me.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.223
You're at the age,
dying to live on your own.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.852
You must've wanted to move out
to be like a cool guy like me, right?

05:55.021 --> 05:56.981
My, these side dishes look amazing.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.447
Kyung-seok moved out of his parents'?

06:04.822 --> 06:09.035
Yes, I was so surprised, too. I was
definitely not expecting to see him there.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.620
There must've been a reason.

06:11.996 --> 06:15.416
I wonder
if the talk Ms. Na had with him went well.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.836
It bothers me
that he moved out right after that.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.421
Are you worried?

06:21.255 --> 06:23.091
A little, I guess.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.885
About yourself or him?

06:25.968 --> 06:27.678
About me? Why?

06:27.762 --> 06:31.349
Now that he lives so close by,
you might fall for him. Are you worried?

06:31.432 --> 06:33.184
What are you talking about?

06:34.060 --> 06:38.439
I think that something big will happen
between you two in the near future.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.651
-Are you writing a novel or what?
-What? It's possible.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.236
Kyung-seok's nice to you.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.987
Stop writing stories.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.032
-You should've majored in literature.
-What?

06:48.116 --> 06:50.118
Eat up. This is really delicious.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.788
I cooked a special meal today
to celebrate your moving in.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.208
-You should cook your meals from tomorrow.
-Okay.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.209
Let's eat.

07:01.921 --> 07:05.591
Mi-rae's mother is a great cook.
This is really delicious.

07:06.175 --> 07:09.762
-How do you know her parents?
-I ran into them a couple of times.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.056
How many times exactly?

07:12.765 --> 07:13.599
What?

07:17.395 --> 07:20.148
-What about your breakfast tomorrow?
-I rarely eat breakfast.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.485
Have you ever worked?

07:25.778 --> 07:26.612
No.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.450
You'll have to turn into
an adult starting from tomorrow.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.994
Reality strikes you once you move out.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.135
<i>Turn right.</i>

07:50.511 --> 07:52.763
<i>You've gone off-course.</i>
<i>You'll be redirected.</i>

07:52.847 --> 07:54.599
DO KYUNG-SEOK

07:59.395 --> 08:02.982
I'm sorry. Today's my first day,
so I'm kind of lost.

08:03.065 --> 08:06.110
No, it's okay. I'm not bothered by you.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.112
Just focus on driving safely.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.156
Okay. Thank you.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.884
I wonder if Ms. Na called
because she knew.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.682
You startled me.

08:38.683 --> 08:39.559
Sorry.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.812
Is recycling your responsibility?

08:42.647 --> 08:43.731
Yes.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.296
Can you wait a little?
I'm not done.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.673
Okay.

09:23.354 --> 09:27.149
Who throws away cans like that?
You know nothing about it.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.288
Are you okay?

09:42.873 --> 09:43.749
Yes.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.002
I'm fine.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.675
Are you hurt? Come over here.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.135
No, it's okay.

09:55.761 --> 09:56.846
Let me see.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.975
I'm really okay.

10:13.571 --> 10:14.655
I'll see you.

10:19.535 --> 10:20.745
See you again.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.204
<i>"See you again"?</i>

10:22.955 --> 10:25.458
<i>Do I need to see him every day now?</i>

10:31.714 --> 10:33.591
-Goodnight.
-You're sleeping already?

10:33.674 --> 10:35.551
I need to leave early in the morning.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.180
You should sleep, too.
You'll have to face reality tomorrow.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.544
Let me see.

11:52.628 --> 11:53.879
I'm really okay.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.580
Hey.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.374
The hot water won't turn on.

12:30.708 --> 12:31.584
<i>Hot water?</i>

12:32.209 --> 12:36.130
<i>I haven't used it yet,</i>
<i>but I'm sure there's a button.</i>

12:36.547 --> 12:39.717
But you're a man.
I'm surprised you shower with hot water.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.473
Gosh, I'm about to faint.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.682
He can't be human.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.395
-No, you should go to him and say hello.
-No.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.189
My gosh.

What are you doing here?

15:02.651 --> 15:04.028
I was waiting for you.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.158
<i>He waited...</i>

15:10.492 --> 15:11.452
<i>for me?</i>

15:13.954 --> 15:17.583
-How did you know we'd come?
-I never saw you pass by.

15:35.559 --> 15:38.145
-The weather's so nice.
-The fine dust level is bad.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.484
It's really bad today.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.406
Why did you move into Woo-young's place?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.533
Didn't you move out to live alone?

15:51.617 --> 15:54.328
It's cheap there.
I don't have money right now.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.164
Didn't your dad offer to pay for you?

16:01.377 --> 16:02.336
Did you run away?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.922
Why would I? I'm not a kid.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.385
Does your mother know about this?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.470
I didn't tell her yet.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.224
Our bus is here.

16:24.942 --> 16:25.901
Hurry up.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.196
I'm sorry.

16:30.864 --> 16:31.699
You go first.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.828
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.719
Is he mad at us?

16:51.802 --> 16:54.722
So why did you have to ask details
about his private life?

16:54.805 --> 16:57.391
We're friends.
You can ask a friend that much.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.351
You asked him
if Ms. Na knew about it.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.647
It doesn't look like he did it
for a good reason, right?

17:04.231 --> 17:05.065
Right.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.205
<i>You face reality once you move out.</i>

17:31.050 --> 17:33.135
Why does he want the study guide from me?

17:33.218 --> 17:35.596
-Who?
-Jang Won-ho.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.100
Gosh, why is he talking so nicely
all of a sudden?

17:41.435 --> 17:43.896
<i>Ji-hyo, do you have a study guide</i>
<i>for the finals?</i>

17:44.480 --> 17:46.023
<i>Would you share it with me?</i>

17:47.232 --> 17:50.652
I guess he's trying to hit on me now
because it doesn't work on you.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.036
I've got you a new cup of coffee.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.413
-You're here.
-Here you go.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.040
Sung-woon.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.084
Check this out.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.252
Here.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.379
HYUN SUA

18:09.505 --> 18:10.839
Here.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.678
It's the picture that I took, right?
She changed her profile.

18:16.762 --> 18:20.057
How do you notice
even her newly updated profile picture?

18:23.727 --> 18:24.895
That's impressive.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.565
Didn't you say you'd get flicked
ten times in the forehead

18:28.649 --> 18:31.276
if she changed her profile
to this picture?

18:31.860 --> 18:37.574
I mean, she shouldn't be giving you
empty hope like this.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.659
This isn't right.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.327
Okay, get ready.

18:40.410 --> 18:43.122
Come on. You're in a good mood today.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.249
-So let it slide this one time.
-Okay.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.712
-One.
-Bring it on.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.882
-Two.
-You're good at it.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.425
Right?

18:56.009 --> 18:56.885
Three.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.221
Awesome.

19:00.597 --> 19:01.640
Sung-woon?

19:02.266 --> 19:04.226
Sung-woon.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.231
Hi, Sua.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.399
Hello.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.484
Can I come over to your house?

19:13.527 --> 19:17.072
Well, it's pretty late
when I go home after my part-time work.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.491
Is that right? How about weekends then?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.619
I have to go to my parents' house
on weekends.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.581
-You mean, Dogok-dong?
-Right.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.416
Do you live with your grandparents?

19:27.708 --> 19:30.043
When you live with
a lot of family members,

19:30.127 --> 19:32.713
it makes you dream of living alone.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.345
My grandparents passed away.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.060
I'll take care of it myself.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.952
You've become very curious about me.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.582
Well, yes. You can tell me
if you're struggling with anything.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.125
I could help you with it.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.669
Okay.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.547
My class is starting soon.
I have to go. See you later.

20:15.672 --> 20:16.506
Bye.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.517
Should I eat spicy stir-fried pork
or omelet rice?

20:27.601 --> 20:28.810
I'll have pork cutlet.

20:29.186 --> 20:32.689
-Spicy stir-fried pork or omelet rice?
-I said I'll have pork cutlet.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.566
-I had it yesterday.
-Pork cutlet.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.026
-Let's go.
-Pork cutlet.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.948
-Hello?
-Have you had lunch?

21:24.408 --> 21:25.284
No.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.577
Come to the faculty cafeteria.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.831
<i>Never mind if you don't want a free meal.</i>

21:47.389 --> 21:50.517
We were having naengmyeon,

21:50.600 --> 21:52.936
and he gave me his egg.

21:53.103 --> 21:57.566
The toppings matter because it's too bland
to eat just the noodles, you know.

21:57.649 --> 22:01.820
Among all the toppings, the half-cut egg
is so precious that you wouldn't share it.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.072
You know what's surprising?

22:05.282 --> 22:06.616
He gave me the pear too.

22:08.785 --> 22:11.204
He knows very well
how to get to your heart.

22:11.288 --> 22:15.876
He meant that I didn't need to lose weight
and that I was cute just the way I was.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.087
Did you kiss each other?

22:21.798 --> 22:23.091
Did you hold hands?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.428
He's conservative,
so he isn't good at it.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.721
Hey.

22:29.806 --> 22:32.059
Those men become open-minded
to their girlfriends.

22:32.142 --> 22:33.643
What are you talking about?

22:33.727 --> 22:35.395
Be quiet. Others might hear you.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.272
Jung-yeob.

22:38.774 --> 22:39.608
Oh, hey.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.319
Let's eat together here.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.405
Ye-na is here, so people won't suspect us.

22:47.657 --> 22:51.286
I'm good at keeping secrets,
so you don't need to worry.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.080
I'm not worried.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.166
-Enjoy your food, then.
-Won't you eat with us?

22:56.750 --> 22:59.044
I'll eat with those guys.

22:59.544 --> 23:00.670
I'll call you later.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.761
Ye-na.

23:17.104 --> 23:20.273
By the way, why do you keep
your relationship from others?

23:21.024 --> 23:22.609
It's no good to make it public.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.236
We'll only be gossiped about.

23:24.903 --> 23:25.737
Did he say that?

23:26.947 --> 23:30.158
Well, I think the same.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.918
Why aren't there any campus couples
in our department?

23:40.001 --> 23:42.629
Maybe it's just that we don't know.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.674
Hi.

23:45.882 --> 23:47.300
-Hello.
-Hello.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.678
-Are you going to have lunch?
-Yes.

23:50.303 --> 23:52.639
I see. Enjoy your lunch.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.849
-Okay.
-Thanks.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.358
You can call me
when you want to grab a drink.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.529
I'm a huge fan of yours.

24:31.011 --> 24:34.389
You can be hungrier and crave more
when you have no money.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.642
-Did you get a part-time job?
-Not yet.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.145
Post an ad on a job-hunting website.
It won't take long.

24:42.522 --> 24:47.402
Or look for private tutoring or teaching
at institutions. They pay you more.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.029
It's easy for us to get one.

24:49.112 --> 24:54.451
If not, look for a modeling job.
It's more than 10,000 won per hour.

24:54.534 --> 24:57.329
The workplaces need to be close
to your house and school.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.080
You can save time and transportation fees.

24:59.873 --> 25:03.335
And... If they often hire a new person,
the work must be tough there.

25:03.418 --> 25:06.922
It means their part-timers often run away.
And what else?

25:07.881 --> 25:11.593
Ask me if something's strange.
I know a lot because I've done all kinds.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.473
I have to go prepare for my next class.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.726
Take your time and eat slowly.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.781
Do you live with Woo-young?

25:34.199 --> 25:35.909
I've heard you two talk.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.578
I eat here to avoid the kids.

25:40.830 --> 25:44.042
I've done a shameful thing.
I deserve a beating from my junior.

25:44.584 --> 25:47.212
I've abused my power
just because I'm a senior.

25:47.837 --> 25:48.713
Sorry about that.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.634
You should be apologizing to Mi-rae,
not me.

25:52.717 --> 25:53.677
What?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.429
Right, I should apologize to her, too.

25:57.097 --> 25:59.975
I've been looking for her
so I could apologize.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.352
But it's not easy to find her.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.563
Do you know where she is?

26:07.357 --> 26:08.858
Do it properly.

26:10.610 --> 26:13.905
Right, I should.
I've done a terrible thing to her.

26:18.868 --> 26:21.246
Can I introduce you
to a good part-time job?

26:22.872 --> 26:25.584
-I'll go first.
-Oh, okay.

26:30.505 --> 26:33.675
What's up with that punk?
Does he like Mi-rae?

26:34.843 --> 26:37.554
He's hot enough to go out with Sua.
What a lunatic.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.807
Gosh, it's hard to maintain relationships.

26:47.772 --> 26:48.815
What's wrong?

26:50.817 --> 26:51.985
Kim Chan-woo?

26:52.068 --> 26:53.153
That Kim Chan-woo?

26:53.236 --> 26:55.739
-What does he want?
-Did something else happen?

26:56.323 --> 26:57.157
No.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.326
Then why, out of the blue?

26:59.909 --> 27:02.037
-Shall I answer it for you?
-No, it's okay.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.334
Are you still scared of that jerk?

27:08.501 --> 27:09.419
Hey.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.715
We avoid poop because it's gross,
not because it's scary.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.224
What's wrong?

27:25.352 --> 27:27.020
Is that the poop?

27:28.813 --> 27:30.106
What does he want?

27:33.985 --> 27:36.488
Hey, Mi-rae. How have you been?

27:39.783 --> 27:42.410
Can we go somewhere quiet
and talk for a moment?

27:42.494 --> 27:43.828
What is this about?

27:45.914 --> 27:48.458
I need to apologize to her
about something.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.467
My friend can come too, right?

27:57.550 --> 27:58.551
What?

27:58.635 --> 28:01.096
I hate even the thought
of being alone with you.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.891
Right, you must feel that way.
I understand.

28:07.143 --> 28:09.312
Can I get you a cold drink?

28:10.105 --> 28:10.980
No, thanks.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.565
Oh, okay.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.824
Hit me and swear at me.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.992
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.495
Violence is the best way
to punish violence.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.872
Why are you being like this suddenly?

28:28.998 --> 28:32.752
You may not believe me,
but I've been very distressed.

28:33.336 --> 28:36.214
I'm a senior,
but I made fun of a freshman's looks.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.884
Sua rejected me but I took it out on you.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.054
I'm really sorry.

28:43.638 --> 28:47.225
Punch me all you want and forgive me.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.151
Forget it, if you regret what you did.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.153
-Hey.
-Does that mean you forgive me?

28:58.236 --> 28:59.446
Get up, please.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.408
Thanks.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.035
-Let's get on good terms.
-All right.

29:07.036 --> 29:10.623
-Just don't do things like that again.
-Of course, I won't. Never.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.251
Mi-rae was really hurt by what happened.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.920
Be grateful
that she's accepting your apology.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.256
Yes, of course. I am grateful.

29:19.632 --> 29:20.467
Then...

29:21.384 --> 29:22.302
I'm off.

29:22.886 --> 29:23.928
All right, bye.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.312
What's with him now?

29:33.897 --> 29:36.065
I guess he wanted to apologize to me.

29:41.863 --> 29:44.866
Who's that midget?
Who does she think she is?

29:45.116 --> 29:46.826
Is your dad a congressman too?

29:49.621 --> 29:50.747
Gosh, my knees.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.051
You must be busy.
What brings you all the way here?

30:03.134 --> 30:07.055
I have too much on my mind. I came here
for your words of encouragement.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.184
I'm not sure how helpful I can be
but I'll do my best.

30:19.776 --> 30:20.610
Then I shall...

30:20.693 --> 30:24.155
I'll always think of you
as well in my prayers.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.657
Thank you.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.965
What's the matter? Any problem?

30:42.048 --> 30:43.800
Kyung-seok moved out.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.927
What is the matter with him?

30:47.345 --> 30:49.305
He met Hye-sung.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.892
He's mad at me for fooling him
when his mom never cheated on me.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.856
So what? Is he staying with her now?

30:57.939 --> 31:01.526
No, he's with Yoo-jin now.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.070
Then he'll come back home soon.

31:05.196 --> 31:09.367
The bar went out of business. He's trying
to see when he can move back home.

31:09.450 --> 31:13.371
You won't find anything like this.
It's in a great location too.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.333
-Oh, I'll show you over there too.
-Okay.

31:20.044 --> 31:20.920
Hey!

31:25.800 --> 31:28.970
For this, you need someone
who's older and experienced. Why me?

31:29.053 --> 31:31.890
My mom just knows how to spend,
not something like this.

31:32.140 --> 31:35.894
She opened it for me when I knew nothing
about business. Can't you tell?

31:40.273 --> 31:43.192
For the premium,
we're thinking 80 million won.

31:43.276 --> 31:46.654
80 million? I paid 100 million
when I got this space.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.073
The business has been very slow.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.910
Not easy to find someone
who's willing to pay this much.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.581
It's because he doesn't know
how to run it.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.416
Other businesses
in the area are doing well.

31:58.499 --> 32:02.253
It was renovated only a few months ago.
How could you ask for 20 less?

32:02.337 --> 32:04.756
Please be considerate
of how much we'd be losing.

32:08.635 --> 32:11.763
Then let's settle at 90. I can't pay more.

32:11.888 --> 32:12.764
Let's do that.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.851
Are you out of your mind?

32:18.519 --> 32:21.940
If it's less than that, I'll get
kicked out. My dad will beat me up.

32:27.737 --> 32:32.241
It all comes down to money. They can't do
anything if we cut off financial support.

32:32.325 --> 32:35.620
Right? He'll come back home
and beg me, right?

32:35.703 --> 32:37.246
Don't even give tuition fees.

32:38.957 --> 32:43.127
He can figure out a way to support
himself, but not for a long time.

32:43.711 --> 32:46.255
You must be firm and strict
at times like this.

32:46.547 --> 32:48.549
If you go easy on him, it never ends.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.927
I certainly won't go easy on him.

32:51.010 --> 32:53.513
No parent can win against their children,

32:53.596 --> 32:56.975
but children can't win against
their parents either. You know that?

33:07.610 --> 33:10.071
Make sure you button up your lab coats.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.823
And tie your hair back, too.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.867
Tie your hair back. You, too.

33:14.951 --> 33:16.494
It's for your safety.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.997
Why did you submit your report
a week late?

33:19.330 --> 33:20.456
Because of him!

33:21.541 --> 33:25.128
Can we move along already?
He's such a nag.

33:25.211 --> 33:29.132
I wonder if he also nags people around.
If he does, he probably has no friends.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.842
Thanks for not being meaner.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.428
I have no friends. How did you know?

33:33.970 --> 33:35.221
No, don't mind us.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.514
We were just kidding.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.224
We must follow the protocol.

33:40.476 --> 33:42.812
I don't think you're a nag.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.773
I think you must be popular
among your friends.

33:50.945 --> 33:53.614
Oh, really? Thanks.

34:06.627 --> 34:07.670
So what is it?

34:11.007 --> 34:12.425
I have a crush on Woo-young.

34:12.507 --> 34:13.551
-What?
-What?

34:13.634 --> 34:14.886
I want to date him.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.638
I have no idea
how to make that happen.

34:18.347 --> 34:19.849
Give me some advice, girls.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.062
Oh, my goodness.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.063
Yoon-byul, this is crazy.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.733
You're so cute.

34:28.815 --> 34:30.525
Do you really have a crush on him?

34:30.610 --> 34:32.527
Have you ever seen her cracking jokes?

34:33.571 --> 34:34.781
How did that happen?

34:37.241 --> 34:41.204
I've been watching him. I have a lot
to learn from him, and he's sensible.

34:41.788 --> 34:45.083
He's a great role model.
Plus, he's handsome, too.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.376
What should we do?

34:47.460 --> 34:49.629
But how can you say that to his face?

34:50.338 --> 34:53.591
Why can't I? As far as I know,
he's not seeing anyone.

34:55.217 --> 34:56.886
Right, he is single,

34:57.470 --> 35:01.140
but all of his ex-girlfriends were
drop-dead gorgeous.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.558
-Seriously?
-So what?

35:02.642 --> 35:04.185
Yoon-byul is pretty too.

35:04.268 --> 35:06.687
I just wish she was a bit more feminine.

35:06.771 --> 35:10.233
I know, right? Grow your hair out
and put on some makeup.

35:10.858 --> 35:15.029
I like your tomboy style,
but I don't think that's Woo-young's type.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.781
What's wrong with my style?

35:18.241 --> 35:19.158
You are pretty.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.704
-Hello.
-Hello.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.624
It's been a while, girls.

35:27.875 --> 35:30.419
Do you know any good part-time positions?

35:30.503 --> 35:32.421
Why are you asking that suddenly?

35:32.964 --> 35:35.174
I'm helping Kyung-seok
find a part-time job.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.177
Why would you do that for Kyung-seok?

35:39.178 --> 35:40.763
Kyung-seok and I are close.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.348
You guys are close?

35:42.431 --> 35:44.058
"After a storm comes a calm."

35:44.142 --> 35:47.562
I apologized and reconciled with him,
and now we're very close.

35:51.607 --> 35:54.193
-Gosh, we're friends.
-You're quite strong.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.571
Hey. Do you have part-time jobs?

35:57.280 --> 35:58.114
-No.
-No.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.575
You guys have so much to learn.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.036
You should learn from Kyung-seok.

36:04.453 --> 36:05.538
Let's learn from him.

36:05.621 --> 36:07.748
How am I going to get him a part-time job?

36:08.332 --> 36:11.502
Gosh, he just shows up out of nowhere
and talks nonsense.

36:13.504 --> 36:15.381
Yoo-jin put his bar up for sale.

36:15.965 --> 36:18.676
Really? Then what's going to happen
to his bar?

36:18.759 --> 36:21.512
It'll have a different owner.

36:21.637 --> 36:23.472
He'll be selling it to someone else.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.391
Then what about Yoo-jin?

36:25.474 --> 36:28.978
He's completely bankrupt,
so he's going to go back home.

36:30.938 --> 36:31.772
I see.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.402
I'll help you out.

36:38.571 --> 36:39.906
Goodness, thank you.

36:39.989 --> 36:42.241
It's really hot.
You should drink some water.

36:43.242 --> 36:44.869
-You're always nice.
-Not at all.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.579
Woo-young is so sweet.

36:47.997 --> 36:51.167
Yoo-jin's two years older than Woo-young.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.669
But Woo-young seems way older.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.630
-Should I take it over there?
-Yes.

37:04.805 --> 37:06.515
TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY: 50,000 WON

37:06.641 --> 37:08.434
CURRENT BALANCE: 800 WON

37:08.517 --> 37:09.894
800 won.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.531
Can I sit next to you?

37:24.992 --> 37:26.327
Do whatever you want.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.884
That's our homework for General Physics.

37:42.885 --> 37:44.262
It's due today.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.597
Some questions were pretty hard to solve.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.182
Are you stuck on any?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.183
Not really.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.604
Everyone's saying
the questions are hard.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.026
You solved this one.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.028
Can you teach me how?

38:22.925 --> 38:24.260
Do you get it now?

38:24.343 --> 38:27.096
I had a hard time solving this question.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.306
Thanks.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.147
Mi-rae.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.607
You're here.

38:38.691 --> 38:41.027
Hey.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.488
-Hey, Mi-rae.
-Hi.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.158
Sit here.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.328
What?

38:50.411 --> 38:51.537
What's wrong?

38:53.289 --> 38:54.332
No, it's nothing.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.430
-Are you doing homework for Physics?
-Yes.

39:09.847 --> 39:10.681
It's nothing.

39:12.475 --> 39:15.186
Hey, Kyung-seok.
Did you move away from home?

39:15.811 --> 39:17.605
-Yes.
-Really?

39:18.647 --> 39:21.525
Gosh, I thought Chan-woo was
talking nonsense.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.694
Did you ask him to find a job for you?

39:24.195 --> 39:25.029
No.

39:25.112 --> 39:27.740
Come on, why would he ask him
to look for a job?

39:27.823 --> 39:29.116
Plus, why would he work?

39:29.950 --> 39:31.827
-I do need a part-time job.
-Why?

39:32.495 --> 39:33.329
I need money.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.831
Don't you get money from your dad?

39:36.957 --> 39:37.792
No.

39:40.086 --> 39:40.961
Really?

39:43.672 --> 39:46.175
<i>Please don't tell anyone</i>
<i>that you live near my place.</i>

39:47.009 --> 39:48.719
Sua, you moved out as well.

39:50.346 --> 39:51.180
Really?

39:52.640 --> 39:54.975
I recently started living by myself.

39:55.518 --> 39:56.435
Since when?

39:57.186 --> 39:59.647
It's been a while. It's really fun.

40:00.022 --> 40:01.023
Don't you agree?

40:02.358 --> 40:05.027
Are you guys living together?

40:05.694 --> 40:07.738
-What?
-I'm wondering the same thing.

40:08.155 --> 40:11.534
You are both from rich families
and moved out at a similar time.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.247
-I smell something fishy.
-Hey.

40:16.330 --> 40:18.249
You're really talking nonsense.

40:18.332 --> 40:20.000
It's not entirely impossible.

40:20.584 --> 40:24.255
Kyung-seok and Sua are living
in a parallel universe.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.383
You look good together.
Why don't you just date?

40:27.466 --> 40:29.135
Date each other.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.261
Hey.

40:31.137 --> 40:32.638
You better watch what you say.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.809
I'll watch what I say.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.743
-Get me a designer handbag for women.
-For women?

40:55.327 --> 40:57.788
It's for Kyung-hee,
so get the trendiest one.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.000
Price doesn't matter,
so get me the best one.

41:03.210 --> 41:05.671
He's going to give Kyung-hee
a designer handbag?

41:11.927 --> 41:15.014
These two are the most expensive products
in our store.

41:15.097 --> 41:19.518
This product has been purchased
by the top Korean celebrities.

41:19.602 --> 41:20.519
There's only one left.

41:20.603 --> 41:24.148
This one's a limited edition
and only five were imported.

41:24.231 --> 41:25.941
It's a popular item in Hollywood.

41:26.025 --> 41:30.237
Many female idols wanted this,
but they all gave up because of the price.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.280
I see.

41:32.823 --> 41:35.409
I guess this will be better
for a 17-year-old.

41:36.202 --> 41:37.786
A 17-year-old?

41:39.163 --> 41:41.165
She's so pretty.

41:41.248 --> 41:42.625
Is she a celebrity?

41:43.125 --> 41:44.793
She looks so elegant.

41:46.795 --> 41:49.590
-I look forward to working with you.
-Me too.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.510
She's the CEO of Kelun.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.471
They'll be doing a collaboration
with our brand.

41:56.055 --> 41:57.932
Please send my regards to your CEO.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.559
Okay, I will. We should get going now.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.327
What's up with with this weather?

42:19.453 --> 42:20.287
Let's go.

42:21.664 --> 42:22.998
-Actually...
-Yes?

42:23.082 --> 42:25.834
I'd like one
that will suit a middle-aged woman.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.379
I'll introduce some other products.

42:33.300 --> 42:37.012
You don't have anything else scheduled
for the day. Do you want to go home?

42:39.431 --> 42:40.474
Just a moment.

42:49.858 --> 42:51.110
Hey, Ms. Na.

42:51.193 --> 42:53.737
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if we could meet up for a while.</i>

42:54.405 --> 42:55.823
<i>I have something to ask you.</i>

42:55.906 --> 42:59.326
I'll go to your neighborhood.
Just tell me your address.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.413
Okay, I'll see you later.

43:03.289 --> 43:04.164
Bye.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.798
You already hired someone?

43:15.718 --> 43:16.760
Okay.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.598
Have you still not found a job?

43:22.224 --> 43:23.100
No.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.853
Why don't you apply where I work?

43:26.812 --> 43:29.648
It's located near our school
and the owner's really kind.

43:31.442 --> 43:32.484
How much is the pay?

43:34.570 --> 43:38.157
If the owner likes you, he pays you more
than the minimum wage.

43:42.870 --> 43:45.247
Isn't he Kyung-seok
from the Chemistry department?

43:46.040 --> 43:47.708
Will he be working here?

43:49.293 --> 43:51.754
To be honest,
we don't need to hire anymore.

43:52.212 --> 43:54.632
-Do you know how to make a latte?
-No.

43:56.258 --> 43:59.094
Then have you ever worked
as a waiter before?

43:59.178 --> 44:02.598
No. I've only waited tables
at the school festival.

44:09.605 --> 44:13.692
There won't be much to learn. You'll just
have to stay as handsome as you are now.

44:14.943 --> 44:16.945
Sua asked me for a special favor.

44:18.781 --> 44:21.450
You can come to work with Sua
starting tomorrow.

44:22.451 --> 44:23.410
Okay.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.371
Thank you, sir.

44:25.954 --> 44:26.914
This is great news.

44:28.624 --> 44:29.625
Yes.

44:32.795 --> 44:36.131
Hey, I think one of us will end up
getting fired.

44:37.633 --> 44:39.051
It'll probably be me.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.388
Our manager always hires people
based on their looks.

44:43.472 --> 44:45.265
It sucks to be ugly.

44:45.349 --> 44:46.850
I agree.

44:46.934 --> 44:49.311
See? He's calling me already.

44:51.271 --> 44:52.606
This is so annoying.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.152
Where are you?

44:57.403 --> 44:59.863
I have something to say,
so please come upstairs.

45:01.824 --> 45:03.200
-Sir.
-Yes?

45:03.283 --> 45:05.703
I'm sorry. I don't think I can work here.

45:05.786 --> 45:07.746
-What?
-Bye.

45:08.330 --> 45:09.373
Wait.

45:14.336 --> 45:17.089
Good-looking punks are always so rude.

45:22.302 --> 45:23.387
You wanted to see me?

45:23.470 --> 45:26.807
I just wanted to tell you
that you're doing a great job.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.560
-Keep up the good work.
-Pardon?

45:29.852 --> 45:31.353
Get back to work.

45:32.688 --> 45:34.064
Kyung-seok.

45:35.357 --> 45:36.525
What's wrong?

45:37.109 --> 45:40.738
Didn't you know
that someone would lose their job

45:41.447 --> 45:42.281
if I got hired?

45:45.492 --> 45:46.368
What do you mean?

45:48.203 --> 45:50.664
I only did it to help you.

45:52.541 --> 45:53.500
Thank you.

45:54.334 --> 45:55.961
You don't have to care about me.

45:56.545 --> 45:57.588
Kyung-seok.

46:00.215 --> 46:01.717
You're so mean, you know that?

46:01.800 --> 46:03.510
Is this my fault, too?

46:06.388 --> 46:08.390
I just don't want to harm others.

46:09.349 --> 46:10.392
Bye.

46:31.914 --> 46:33.582
Do Kyung-seok.

46:34.875 --> 46:35.709
Me?

46:39.505 --> 46:40.631
Were you waiting for me?

46:40.714 --> 46:42.007
What?

46:43.467 --> 46:44.343
No.

46:45.135 --> 46:46.011
Never.

46:53.352 --> 46:56.939
I'm meeting someone here.

46:58.273 --> 46:59.149
Who?

47:01.235 --> 47:02.152
Woo-young?

47:03.195 --> 47:05.113
-What?
-Are you meeting him alone?

47:05.197 --> 47:06.365
No.

47:08.450 --> 47:09.701
Do you like him?

47:12.371 --> 47:13.288
Do you?

47:16.959 --> 47:19.419
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

47:22.923 --> 47:24.591
Why can't you answer?

47:24.675 --> 47:25.968
Do you like Woo-young?

47:26.051 --> 47:29.721
Hey, be quiet.
It's just that I'm flustered.

47:29.805 --> 47:31.139
You aren't saying no.

47:32.558 --> 47:34.560
No, I don't like him, satisfied?

47:36.937 --> 47:37.813
Okay.

47:40.357 --> 47:42.067
What if someone hears it?

47:42.150 --> 47:45.279
Why do you care about that?
You said you don't like him.

47:45.988 --> 47:48.407
Hey, you might not understand,

47:48.490 --> 47:51.285
but people usually care about rumors.

47:55.247 --> 47:56.206
Ms. Na.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.125
You're here.

48:04.006 --> 48:05.257
Were you waiting for her?

48:05.883 --> 48:06.842
That's right.

48:08.302 --> 48:09.219
What about you?

48:10.804 --> 48:11.930
I live nearby here.

48:12.639 --> 48:13.599
What?

48:15.809 --> 48:17.019
Well, right.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.980
He moved to this neighborhood recently.

48:21.982 --> 48:23.025
I see.

48:26.486 --> 48:27.738
How is it?

48:28.363 --> 48:29.990
It must not be comfortable.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.118
It's manageable.

48:33.702 --> 48:34.620
I see.

48:36.204 --> 48:38.790
Let's grab a meal together soon.

48:41.793 --> 48:42.669
Let's go, Mi-rae.

48:43.253 --> 48:44.379
Okay.

48:48.133 --> 48:49.134
Buy me a meal today.

48:52.471 --> 48:53.347
What?

48:54.598 --> 48:55.974
If you don't mind.

48:57.184 --> 48:58.685
Of course, you can join us.

48:59.478 --> 49:00.354
You want to?

49:12.950 --> 49:15.661
You wouldn't even try this
when you were young.

49:20.958 --> 49:24.086
You might get an upset stomach.
Eat slowly.

49:36.807 --> 49:38.392
Why did you want to see Mi-rae?

49:41.895 --> 49:42.771
Well...

49:43.897 --> 49:45.816
You know, Mi-rae likes perfume.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.402
We're like a mentor and mentee.

49:49.486 --> 49:50.320
That's right.

49:52.489 --> 49:53.907
How are you feeling?

49:54.658 --> 49:56.243
I'm all better now.

50:06.336 --> 50:10.048
-Can I order something else?
-Of course. What do you want?

50:12.259 --> 50:13.093
Soju.

50:14.428 --> 50:15.804
Soju?

50:15.887 --> 50:17.389
Yes, or soju bomb.

50:20.892 --> 50:21.727
Shall we?

50:22.769 --> 50:23.854
Excuse me.

50:24.521 --> 50:27.065
Can we have a bottle of soju
and two bottles of beer?

50:54.968 --> 50:56.053
Cheers.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.524
<i>He must get his drinking skill from her.</i>

51:23.330 --> 51:25.415
This is for me?

51:26.249 --> 51:30.128
The most expensive bag in the store.
Don't brag about it too much though.

51:34.007 --> 51:36.259
Put your computer back in your room.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.803
Really?

51:42.599 --> 51:44.935
I'm telling you this just in case.

51:45.310 --> 51:47.771
Tell me if you get a call from that woman.

51:48.563 --> 51:49.898
Don't ever meet her.

52:11.878 --> 52:14.047
I'm glad you and Mi-rae are neighbors.

52:15.715 --> 52:16.842
Do you live alone?

52:17.384 --> 52:19.219
No, I have a roommate.

52:19.302 --> 52:20.428
Is that right?

52:24.057 --> 52:25.851
Aren't you going to ask me...

52:26.685 --> 52:27.769
why I moved out?

52:29.396 --> 52:30.397
Actually,

52:31.231 --> 52:35.068
I knew about it
because your father came to see me.

52:38.196 --> 52:41.283
I was worried and curious.

52:42.909 --> 52:44.035
But...

52:44.953 --> 52:46.538
I couldn't call you.

52:49.249 --> 52:50.167
Why?

52:52.502 --> 52:54.629
I thought you might not like it.

53:08.101 --> 53:09.769
You can really hold your alcohol.

53:14.774 --> 53:18.111
Kyung-seok is famous at school
for being able to hold his liquor.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.739
-Really?
-Yes.

53:21.823 --> 53:22.949
I guess...

53:24.534 --> 53:26.203
I get that from you.

53:40.383 --> 53:42.302
Why don't we call it a day after this one?

53:42.385 --> 53:45.722
You shouldn't drink too much
on a school night.

53:50.352 --> 53:52.312
We already drank too much.

54:02.489 --> 54:04.449
I'll treat you to delicious food again.

54:05.825 --> 54:07.077
Thank you.

54:10.038 --> 54:11.081
Ms. Na.

54:14.167 --> 54:16.962
Woo-young.
Do you live in this neighborhood too?

54:20.131 --> 54:21.383
He's my roommate.

54:23.426 --> 54:24.594
Really?

54:25.470 --> 54:26.638
That's good.

54:32.310 --> 54:36.106
Actually, Kyung-seok is my son.

54:38.191 --> 54:39.776
Oh, I see.

54:41.903 --> 54:42.988
How do you know him?

54:45.407 --> 54:47.826
Professor Park in your department is
fond of him.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.953
I know him very well.

54:50.620 --> 54:52.497
Why don't you come to see our place?

54:53.957 --> 54:54.833
May I?

54:54.916 --> 54:57.294
Of course.
I bought a bottle of soju for him.

54:58.461 --> 55:01.256
My gosh, we already drank a little bit.

55:01.339 --> 55:03.550
Then go for a second round at our place.

55:07.554 --> 55:09.639
I don't want to impose.

55:10.223 --> 55:11.474
Not at all. Let's go.

55:12.058 --> 55:14.894
Then shall I come in
for just a few minutes?

55:14.978 --> 55:16.438
Mi-rae, you should join us.

55:17.188 --> 55:18.273
This way, please.

55:24.487 --> 55:25.697
I'll just go home.

55:25.780 --> 55:27.699
Why? Come with us.

55:35.623 --> 55:38.001
Your place is very neat and cozy.

55:38.418 --> 55:40.837
Kyung-seok doesn't have a bed, though.

55:40.920 --> 55:41.796
Not a big deal.

55:42.422 --> 55:43.923
Please take good care of him.

55:44.924 --> 55:46.301
Feel free to come by.

55:46.885 --> 55:49.554
Next time, I'll bring good food with me.

55:49.637 --> 55:50.722
Thanks for today.

55:50.805 --> 55:52.682
No problem.
I didn't even do anything.

55:53.600 --> 55:54.934
Then... Cheers, everyone.

56:00.690 --> 56:01.941
Isn't that your third one?

56:06.071 --> 56:06.988
You can drink more?

56:08.031 --> 56:08.948
Yes.

56:09.532 --> 56:11.284
Mi-rae, are you really all right?

56:11.368 --> 56:12.994
Yes, I'm totally fine.

56:13.995 --> 56:16.456
Please feel free
to speak casually to me, Ms. Na.

56:16.539 --> 56:17.957
I'm his friend.

56:20.085 --> 56:22.420
-Can I?
-Of course.

56:23.588 --> 56:25.090
I'm happy that you seem close.

56:26.800 --> 56:27.634
Do we?

56:32.263 --> 56:33.390
Are you seeing anyone?

56:34.974 --> 56:36.893
-No.
-Do you have a crush on anyone?

56:41.773 --> 56:43.066
He probably does.

56:44.609 --> 56:45.568
Really?

56:47.237 --> 56:49.280
-Who is it?
-What are you talking about?

56:49.864 --> 56:50.740
Who is this girl?

56:50.824 --> 56:52.283
Is she first year or older?

56:52.367 --> 56:53.701
I never said anything.

56:54.494 --> 56:55.620
You're not denying it.

56:59.290 --> 57:02.001
-I don't have a crush.
-I guess you can't lie.

57:02.419 --> 57:04.254
You couldn't lie
when you were a kid.

57:05.755 --> 57:07.340
Think whatever you want.

57:14.305 --> 57:15.807
Why did you down it like that?

57:17.183 --> 57:20.520
<i>Ms. Na must be the happiest person</i>
<i>at this moment.</i>

57:21.771 --> 57:24.649
<i>Actually, Kyung-seok could be as well.</i>

57:28.987 --> 57:30.155
What are you...

57:31.072 --> 57:32.157
doing here?

57:32.740 --> 57:33.867
You're all grown up now.

57:36.077 --> 57:38.079
<i>Even until just a little while ago,</i>

57:39.164 --> 57:43.209
<i>they probably couldn't even imagine</i>
<i>chatting with each other like this.</i>

57:45.378 --> 57:47.088
<i>We all change,</i>

57:47.797 --> 57:49.507
<i>and so do our relationships.</i>

57:58.975 --> 58:00.393
<i>And I had no idea...</i>

58:02.645 --> 58:05.773
<i>that I'd meet the person</i>
<i>who saved my life when I was younger</i>

58:05.899 --> 58:08.276
<i>again like this.</i>

58:09.903 --> 58:11.404
It has nothing to do with you.

58:12.780 --> 58:15.283
<i>I also didn't know that I'd be able to...</i>

58:15.366 --> 58:18.369
<i>call the handsome guy, Kyung-seok,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>

58:18.453 --> 58:20.997
I'm no longer an outcast.
I have a friend now.

58:21.456 --> 58:22.290
What?

58:23.416 --> 58:24.375
I have you.

58:26.252 --> 58:28.379
<i>No matter how insignificant the change is,</i>

58:28.755 --> 58:31.424
<i>and although we can't even imagine</i>
<i>its consequences...</i>

58:32.800 --> 58:34.928
-You two look so much alike.
-You think so?

58:35.220 --> 58:38.306
<i>...if it's a heartwarming change</i>
<i>like this, it'll be so nice.</i>

58:40.767 --> 58:43.603
<i>Others' happiness can give me</i>
<i>this much joy.</i>

58:44.646 --> 58:46.356
<i>I felt it for the very first time.</i>

58:52.487 --> 58:53.363
Mi-rae.

58:54.072 --> 58:55.031
-Mi-rae.
-Mi-rae.

58:55.114 --> 58:56.241
What should we do?

58:56.324 --> 58:57.450
-Mi-rae.
-Mi-rae.

58:57.534 --> 58:58.701
Gosh.

59:00.912 --> 59:03.122
I'm all right. I'm really okay.

59:03.206 --> 59:05.750
I should take her home. Let me carry her.

59:05.833 --> 59:07.252
No, I'll carry her.

59:08.002 --> 59:09.128
I'm really okay.

59:09.212 --> 59:12.090
-I'll do it. Put her on my back.
-No, I'll carry her.

59:12.465 --> 59:14.050
-Gosh.
-I'm really all right.

59:14.133 --> 59:16.261
Kyung-seok, you should carry her.

59:16.427 --> 59:17.470
Woo-young, help me.

59:17.554 --> 59:19.681
-Oh, okay.
-Mi-rae, I'll help you up.

59:20.723 --> 59:22.308
-I'm okay, though.
-There.

59:24.352 --> 59:26.271
Don't worry.
We'll get her home safely.

59:26.854 --> 59:28.147
Okay.

59:30.149 --> 59:31.109
Are you all right?

59:31.818 --> 59:32.777
Oh, boy.

59:33.861 --> 59:35.280
Yes, I'm fine.

59:35.363 --> 59:36.447
She's not fine.

59:36.531 --> 59:38.449
-I'll get going.
-Get home safely.

59:38.533 --> 59:40.493
-Make sure she gets home safely.
-Bye.

59:41.494 --> 59:42.453
Be careful.

59:42.537 --> 59:44.998
Get home safely. Hey, be careful.

59:48.835 --> 59:50.628
What's wrong? What happened to her?

59:50.712 --> 59:53.798
-She passed out after three shots of soju.
-What?

59:55.967 --> 59:57.510
Hello.

59:58.011 --> 1:00:00.054
Aren't you her friend who came with her
to the event?

1:00:00.138 --> 1:00:02.265
-Yes, I am.
-Where's her bed?

1:00:02.432 --> 1:00:03.808
Here, this one.

1:00:06.102 --> 1:00:07.395
What happened?

1:00:08.104 --> 1:00:09.105
Be careful.

1:00:11.232 --> 1:00:12.400
She'll be okay, right?

1:00:13.318 --> 1:00:16.863
Of course, she'll be fine.
Thank you so much.

1:00:19.866 --> 1:00:22.118
-I'll see you around.
-Oh, thank you.

1:00:25.413 --> 1:00:26.539
Bye.

1:00:37.050 --> 1:00:38.885
-Get home safely.
-I will.

1:00:39.385 --> 1:00:40.970
I'm so happy for them.

1:00:42.722 --> 1:00:44.057
What a relief.

1:00:50.730 --> 1:00:52.523
You could've moved into my place.

1:00:55.234 --> 1:00:56.402
You must be uncomfortable

1:00:57.403 --> 1:01:00.073
since we've been living separately
for too long.

1:01:03.576 --> 1:01:04.827
It's not that.

1:01:07.205 --> 1:01:08.790
I wanted to live independently.

1:01:11.584 --> 1:01:12.752
You need some money?

1:01:15.088 --> 1:01:17.131
No, it's okay.

1:01:21.177 --> 1:01:24.347
Buy a hangover recovery drink
for Mi-rae tomorrow morning.

1:01:26.808 --> 1:01:28.351
I don't have any change. Here.

1:01:46.953 --> 1:01:48.579
Can I give you a hug?

1:01:53.710 --> 1:01:54.544
Yes.

1:02:34.375 --> 1:02:35.918
You should come over sometime.

1:02:37.128 --> 1:02:38.004
Okay.

1:03:28.221 --> 1:03:29.305
Hello.

1:03:30.264 --> 1:03:32.391
-I'd like a transit pass, please.
-Sure.

1:03:39.649 --> 1:03:42.193
HANGOVER CHASER

1:03:42.276 --> 1:03:43.486
I'd like this, too.

1:03:44.195 --> 1:03:45.071
Sure.

1:04:08.594 --> 1:04:09.762
Are you up?

1:04:11.305 --> 1:04:12.682
Do you remember anything?

1:04:14.016 --> 1:04:14.892
About what?

1:04:14.976 --> 1:04:16.811
Kyung-seok carried you on his back.

1:04:18.104 --> 1:04:18.938
What?

1:04:19.897 --> 1:04:21.148
Ms. Na came, too.

1:04:24.402 --> 1:04:26.654
They met up to reconcile.

1:04:26.737 --> 1:04:28.906
Why did you have to tag along
and ruin it all?

1:04:29.156 --> 1:04:30.533
What happened?

1:04:31.367 --> 1:04:32.201
I don't know.

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:36.163
I have class, so I have to leave now.

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:39.500
I made hangover soup for you.
Have some.

1:04:45.464 --> 1:04:49.510
Gosh, I should've stopped
after my second shot.

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:08.613
Hi.

1:05:12.909 --> 1:05:14.702
HANGOVER CHASER

1:05:15.661 --> 1:05:16.537
I'm fine.

1:05:16.621 --> 1:05:19.916
You can't be. Isn't three shots of soju
your drinking limit?

1:05:27.548 --> 1:05:28.591
Take it.

1:05:56.494 --> 1:05:57.578
Is your stomach okay?

1:05:59.789 --> 1:06:02.792
Yes, I think I feel better now.

1:06:05.962 --> 1:06:08.589
Don't worry.
You didn't make any drunken mistakes.

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:12.593
What are you talking about?
I heard you carried me home.

1:06:12.677 --> 1:06:13.678
What about it?

1:06:14.261 --> 1:06:16.305
I'm sorry for the trouble.

1:06:18.099 --> 1:06:21.268
Don't ever drink more than three shots
when I'm not around.

1:06:22.395 --> 1:06:23.229
What?

1:06:26.023 --> 1:06:28.192
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

1:06:57.763 --> 1:06:58.931
Are you her boyfriend?

1:06:59.015 --> 1:07:00.016
-Yes.
-No.

1:07:00.099 --> 1:07:02.268
<i>Why is he being like this?</i>
<i>He's leading me on.</i>

1:07:02.351 --> 1:07:04.895
Oh, I see Mi-rae and Woo-young over there.

1:07:04.979 --> 1:07:06.480
You're the prettiest girl.

1:07:06.564 --> 1:07:08.024
Don't you want a boyfriend?

1:07:08.107 --> 1:07:10.609
-I can make it to the interview.
-They need more workers?

1:07:10.693 --> 1:07:13.237
Are you doing a facial mask
for your part-time job?

1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:14.822
You and Mi-rae work together?

1:07:14.905 --> 1:07:16.907
-Have you cried tears of joy?
-What?

1:07:16.991 --> 1:07:20.119
I'm not sure if it's enough to cry.
I'm happy we met again.

1:07:20.202 --> 1:07:22.788
Do they need another part-timer
by any chance?

1:07:22.872 --> 1:07:24.582
I like Kyung-seok.
