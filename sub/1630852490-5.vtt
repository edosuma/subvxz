DISCLAIMER: All places, characters, firms,

00:45.240 --> 00:46.340
Let's start

00:49.380 --> 00:50.510
a rumor we're dating.

00:51.750 --> 00:52.950
If it's not outrageous, Reporter Mo won't...

00:52.950 --> 00:54.880
...write an article about us.

00:55.220 --> 00:56.820
So use me.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.990
That was what I wanted to ask you.

01:02.660 --> 01:04.660
How anti-climactic.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.660
Even after I called, I hesitated several times.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.200
But

01:12.030 --> 01:13.770
I have a clear reason for this.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.440
Why are you doing this?

01:17.340 --> 01:18.440
Revenge.

01:19.170 --> 01:21.010
He did that to me, too.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.080
He said he was proving I didn't even have

01:25.250 --> 01:26.580
1% potential.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.840
Ironically, I'm the only anomaly

01:28.870 --> 01:30.500
in that jerk's project.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.050
But that jerk

01:33.520 --> 01:35.360
still hasn't snapped out of it.

01:35.789 --> 01:38.360
They've focused everything on going public.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.729
Let's put a scratch on their major goods.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.300
That's suicide.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.870
You know,

01:46.470 --> 01:48.500
I'm not that easily breakable.

01:49.970 --> 01:52.110
I'll say it's groundless.

01:52.340 --> 01:53.410
Of course.

01:55.180 --> 01:57.680
Thank you. Again.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.930
Whoa! No way!

02:10.930 --> 02:12.460
Did he really say he'd do it?

02:12.830 --> 02:13.260
Yes.

02:13.260 --> 02:14.260
Jenna.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.800
Will it really be okay?

02:17.870 --> 02:19.500
It'll just be a day's happening.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.500
We just

02:21.340 --> 02:22.640
have to get Reporter Mo's attention.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.840
What about Ji-han?

02:23.910 --> 02:26.040
The scandal will hurt his image.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.880
Let's do it.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.780
We don't have the luxury to consider others.

02:30.610 --> 02:31.610
Let's do it.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.920
What should we do now?

02:33.180 --> 02:35.020
I can't get used to that.

02:37.050 --> 02:38.650
Tip Reporter Mo off.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.860
The bait is ready.

02:40.860 --> 02:41.620
Stop it.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.060
Why are you being so juvenile?

02:43.060 --> 02:45.660
A battle of a man's pride is that juvenile.

02:45.790 --> 02:46.900
Are you

02:47.200 --> 02:49.060
doing this to help Cotton Candy?

02:49.060 --> 02:50.430
Because of Jenna?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.930
Is this you taking care of your team?

02:52.930 --> 02:54.540
Why are you suddenly fighting for justice?

02:55.500 --> 02:57.170
Are you bored just doing a unit?

03:06.580 --> 03:07.820
What was it like for you?

03:09.350 --> 03:10.820
Kids like us,

03:12.450 --> 03:15.120
we all had desperate times.

03:18.230 --> 03:20.300
It wasn't about making it to the finish line.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.660
It was hoping for someone

03:24.900 --> 03:27.100
to hold your hand just this once.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.040
I've done that many times.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.740
Justice?

03:35.740 --> 03:36.680
Help?

03:38.250 --> 03:39.750
It's not that.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.190
It's because I could see myself in them.

03:49.290 --> 03:50.970
Me, who was so desperate

03:55.100 --> 03:56.829
that I was scared out of my wits.

04:02.570 --> 04:09.280

04:26.090 --> 04:27.530
The girl is a failed...

04:27.530 --> 04:28.360
I mean,

04:28.360 --> 04:30.770
a leader of some idol group.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.450
They're meeting tomorrow.

04:32.630 --> 04:36.140
If you give me compensation, I'll tell you where.

04:36.340 --> 04:37.740
The girl is an idol singer?

04:37.740 --> 04:38.540
Who?

04:38.540 --> 04:41.140
If I tell you that first...

04:42.580 --> 04:45.480
Kim Jenna, the leader of Cotton Candy.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.450
There's a group called that?

04:52.850 --> 04:54.920
Yes! There is!

04:54.920 --> 04:56.890
It's a failed idol group!

04:56.890 --> 04:59.830
It's crap that a top idol is dating a failed idol!

04:59.830 --> 05:01.960
Go stop my idol!

05:07.540 --> 05:09.740
Have you changed your mind yet?

05:10.010 --> 05:11.740
Let's do this before I change my mind.

05:11.940 --> 05:13.110
See you there.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.220
Sunglasses...

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
Yes?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Yes.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.680
Why aren't they picking up?

06:36.830 --> 06:39.190
Wow, he's so excited.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.800
Huh? Jenna's here.

06:46.230 --> 06:47.230
Huh?

07:01.020 --> 07:04.150
You're at the perfect angle for the paparazzi.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.590
When is the rooster coming?

07:12.690 --> 07:13.600
Huh?

07:13.830 --> 07:14.830
He's here.

07:17.430 --> 07:18.600
He didn't run.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.540
I guess he's a better person than I thought.

07:42.490 --> 07:43.590
Kim Jenna!

07:48.930 --> 07:49.970
Who's that?

07:51.330 --> 07:52.270
What the?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.970
What's that jerk doing here?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.440
How did he know to come?

08:07.920 --> 08:10.290
What do we do?

08:10.290 --> 08:12.150
Go to the rooster, quick!

08:17.690 --> 08:19.030
Kim Jenna!

08:37.750 --> 08:39.350
Why, why, why?

08:39.350 --> 08:41.679
Why is she going that way?

08:42.820 --> 08:44.290
I live only for today.

08:44.290 --> 08:45.970
I don't have a tomorrow.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.390
So this saying was the trend once.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.660
"I'm the crazy witch

08:52.930 --> 08:54.030
around here."

08:56.970 --> 08:59.000
Huh? What are you doing?

09:04.010 --> 09:04.940
I'm sorry.

09:31.330 --> 09:32.530
Are you crazy?

09:41.710 --> 09:43.280
What are you doing?

09:44.510 --> 09:45.510
First,

09:45.780 --> 09:47.350
let's get out of here.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.450
You can't let Seo Ji-han just stand there.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.030
Ji-han!

10:04.070 --> 10:04.900
What are you doing here?

10:04.900 --> 10:06.500
I told you to wait in the car.

10:07.070 --> 10:08.800
I was late because of the director.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.870
Oh! Ji-han!

10:10.870 --> 10:12.810
You waited so long because of me, right?

10:12.810 --> 10:14.940
- I'm so sorry.
- What a load of baloney!

10:15.210 --> 10:17.850
What is Jenna thinking?

10:20.520 --> 10:22.180
Go, go.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.120
Go straight.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.940
For us to be a scandal and make the news,

10:40.940 --> 10:42.100
we both are unqualified.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.010
The people don't care about my managing skills.

10:45.010 --> 10:47.110
They care less about you.

10:52.150 --> 10:53.180
But you...

10:53.850 --> 10:55.580
You did that as an improvisation?

10:56.420 --> 10:58.350
How lower are you going to sink?

10:58.950 --> 11:01.120
I'm going to sink as low as I can.

11:01.120 --> 11:01.660
What?

11:01.660 --> 11:03.460
Both of us our unqualified,

11:03.690 --> 11:05.590
but there was one other person there.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.400
He is qualified more than enough.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.530
What are you talking about?

11:08.530 --> 11:11.300
I'm going to say it's a love triangle.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.800
The agency's CEO, a failed idol singer,

11:14.800 --> 11:17.410
and Starpeace's leading star.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.940
Wouldn't Reporter Mo risk his life for a scoop?

11:20.940 --> 11:22.380
You think he'll believe that?

11:22.380 --> 11:24.080
This isn't a game where the truth is important.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.710
You'll make a fool of yourself.

11:25.880 --> 11:26.920
That's good, too.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.250
You're making a mistake.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.550
Let's say I'm making a deal.

11:31.390 --> 11:32.590
There's one day left.

11:33.350 --> 11:34.890
Make your decision until tomorrow.

11:35.620 --> 11:37.590
Mars's fans will kill you.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.660
We've been dead for a long time.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.080
Didn't you know?

12:06.520 --> 12:07.790
Reporter Mo.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.320
What kind of nonsense is that?

12:09.320 --> 12:10.600
Dating?

12:10.990 --> 12:13.860
CEO Cha has been in Korea for just 2 weeks.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.500
Of course.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.070
Ji-han?

12:17.800 --> 12:21.000
He's busy preparing for the unit with Ray.

12:22.870 --> 12:23.870
Yes.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.080
I guess you didn't know.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.480
Seeing she hasn't called you even now

12:32.650 --> 12:34.380
means she played you like a fool.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.820
She doesn't even need your agreement.

12:40.090 --> 12:41.620
How did Starpeace's leading star

12:41.620 --> 12:44.530
play into that woman's hands?

12:46.590 --> 12:47.960
You see?

12:49.160 --> 12:51.330
You can't change much

12:52.170 --> 12:54.030
with foolish bravery.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.910
Give me a good reason why I should

12:59.910 --> 13:01.810
clean the mess you made.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.580
Hey, kid.

13:07.650 --> 13:09.420
I didn't hate your mom.

13:10.690 --> 13:14.460
I hated your mom becoming my mother.

13:16.190 --> 13:17.760
You get what I'm saying?

13:21.860 --> 13:23.730
Draw a line between

13:27.970 --> 13:29.340
public and private matters.

13:29.340 --> 13:30.470
I can't believe

13:33.470 --> 13:35.940
that's still a public matter to you.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.930
Seriously.

13:55.630 --> 13:58.230
I can't keep up with Jenna.

13:58.230 --> 13:59.370
Right?

13:59.570 --> 14:00.840
She said it's a love triangle.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.300
How did she even come up with that?

14:03.300 --> 14:04.210
Amazing.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.840
Totally.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.340
Reporter Mo can't help but eat it up.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.580
Let's

14:13.880 --> 14:15.650
plan the next move.

14:15.650 --> 14:18.220
There's no way the agency will give up the house.

14:19.790 --> 14:23.050
Let's pick songs in our album and remake them.

14:23.220 --> 14:24.830
With the beat that's trending these days.

14:24.830 --> 14:25.990
Remake?

14:26.560 --> 14:27.800
Remake our own songs?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.330
I second that!

14:29.330 --> 14:33.100
Honestly, our concept doesn't match us.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.620
Into my small world

14:36.620 --> 14:39.370
You came like a big gift

14:39.370 --> 14:40.780
What's this?

14:41.210 --> 14:42.980
Seriously,

14:42.980 --> 14:45.450
you know who looked most ridiculous doing this?

14:45.450 --> 14:46.780
-  You.
- You.

14:47.350 --> 14:48.620
Elle!

14:48.620 --> 14:50.690
Oh! Right.

14:53.590 --> 14:54.590
By the way,

14:55.160 --> 14:57.820
Elle knows the current situation, right?

15:03.430 --> 15:04.400
Shouldn't you

15:04.400 --> 15:06.370
have told me first?

15:09.840 --> 15:11.740
I was going to call you.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.480
Before you did that to CEO Cha,

15:18.810 --> 15:20.750
you should've asked me first.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.480
There wasn't time.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.280
You used me in a nasty way.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.320
You told me to use you.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.460
I didn't say stab me in the back!

15:33.630 --> 15:35.400
I thought you were my colleague.

15:36.930 --> 15:38.530
I thought we were one team.

15:41.370 --> 15:42.500
Seo Ji-han.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.670
How can we be one team?

15:47.310 --> 15:49.510
You really think that's possible?

15:50.380 --> 15:51.380
Oh...

15:51.680 --> 15:52.750
So you don't feel

15:52.850 --> 15:56.280
any guilt backing me into a corner?

15:57.950 --> 15:59.150
Kim Jenna.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.790
I apparently judged you wrong.

16:04.590 --> 16:05.790
You are

16:06.890 --> 16:07.930
the worst.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.570
I'm not going to go to the end.

16:13.170 --> 16:15.140
If it doesn't work, I'm going to quit.

16:18.940 --> 16:20.340
Still.

16:20.610 --> 16:21.680
You're the worst.

16:33.150 --> 16:34.690
- Hi, Bbiyong.
- Hi.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.820
So you still haven't heard the song?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.760
I'm not waiting for your decision.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.030
It passed the blind test. It was unanimous.

16:46.270 --> 16:47.440
Also,

16:49.100 --> 16:50.840
so you'd have some affection,

16:50.840 --> 16:52.270
Dan sang the guide.

16:52.270 --> 16:54.040
Okay. I'll listen to it.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.380
Universe (Dan's guide)

17:08.780 --> 17:12.490
I dreamt that the two of us flew the skies

17:12.490 --> 17:15.540
It might not be a dream Babe

17:15.630 --> 17:18.170
Still, you're the worst.

17:18.190 --> 17:20.190
We can fly, stepping on a cloud

17:20.210 --> 17:22.210
Carrying you, I fly far away

17:22.240 --> 17:25.460
Baby, I have no limits

17:26.500 --> 17:28.840
Go high, Go higher

17:28.860 --> 17:30.860
The whole world

17:30.890 --> 17:35.020
Is a lighthouse that shines our way

17:35.050 --> 17:37.050
Life is so sweet

17:37.070 --> 17:39.070
Us together

17:39.100 --> 17:42.090
Just being with you

17:42.110 --> 17:44.110
One of a kind on Earth

17:44.140 --> 17:47.010
You’re the only one, my treasure

17:47.010 --> 17:51.140
Wherever we go

17:51.140 --> 17:55.240
Past the clouds and into space

17:55.510 --> 17:56.680
Forever

17:58.470 --> 18:00.480
Why am I thinking about her?

18:00.980 --> 18:02.500
It's an old soul.

18:03.210 --> 18:04.210
Yes.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.720
What about you?

18:08.980 --> 18:10.750
What kind of music do you want to do?

18:17.210 --> 18:18.960
When I was really young,

18:20.260 --> 18:22.560
I heard this song by chance.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.130
My heart suddenly pounded

18:27.170 --> 18:29.640
and I was reminded of good memories.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.070
That song was just like...

18:33.070 --> 18:34.070
BGM.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.410
Right. Background music.

18:38.780 --> 18:41.620
It felt like the world I was living in

18:41.780 --> 18:44.220
revolved around me.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.650
Like I was the star.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.420
It gave me that feeling.

18:49.820 --> 18:51.180
That's excessive.

18:54.030 --> 18:55.600
Whether it's because you were happy

18:55.900 --> 18:57.430
or comforted

18:58.030 --> 18:59.370
or excited

18:59.970 --> 19:01.400
or you just fell in love,

19:02.900 --> 19:05.640
everyone has a moment

19:05.640 --> 19:08.640
that made their hearts flutter.

19:09.810 --> 19:11.250
A good song

19:12.050 --> 19:14.350
makes you think of those good moments.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.490
Makes you think of good moments...

19:21.220 --> 19:23.620
I have a lot of good moments!

19:24.590 --> 19:26.030
Unbelievable.

19:27.330 --> 19:28.860
Sir!

19:29.000 --> 19:32.300
Why in the world are you doing this?

19:36.900 --> 19:38.170
Yes?

19:44.350 --> 19:46.550
What are you doing there?

19:46.550 --> 19:47.720
Director Yoon!

19:47.720 --> 19:48.620
Before you disband,

19:48.620 --> 19:52.190
all of Cotton Candy's profit for the next 3 months

19:52.190 --> 19:54.520
will be divided between the agency 50:50.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.220
As per the contract.

19:56.690 --> 19:59.030
We didn't do that until now.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.560
Your CEO Ma perks have expired.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.360
You can use the agency's lodging,

20:03.360 --> 20:05.040
but you have to pay rent.

20:05.170 --> 20:08.740
Set the price at market value, Director Yoon.

20:09.370 --> 20:10.830
What a cheap move!

20:13.540 --> 20:15.680
There will be no support from the agency.

20:16.610 --> 20:20.450
If you slander or compromise the agency,

20:21.080 --> 20:23.650
you'll have to compensate for damages.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.620
Specify it in an annex agreement, Director.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.520
Sir.

20:29.790 --> 20:32.130
Do you really have to go so far?

20:32.630 --> 20:33.790
Director Yoon.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.300
Go and take care of it.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.900
Thank you.

20:40.170 --> 20:42.070
Kim Jenna, stay here for a moment.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.240
He looks like he'll strangle her.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.140
Won't she be in danger?

20:48.140 --> 20:50.010
You think he's a psychopath?

20:50.210 --> 20:51.350
What about me?

20:51.650 --> 20:53.110
Don't I look dangerous?

20:53.610 --> 20:54.750
Seriously.

20:54.750 --> 20:57.150
I get KRW 200,000 for dancing one night.

20:57.150 --> 21:00.290
But this successful agency wants half of that?

21:00.290 --> 21:01.890
To get a snack?

21:01.890 --> 21:04.160
It's unbelievable, the more I think about it.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.160
Hyun-ji.

21:05.530 --> 21:06.890
I'm sorry.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.370
You think you won?

21:13.070 --> 21:14.200
Keep this in mind.

21:16.170 --> 21:18.410
Because of your petty bravado,

21:18.410 --> 21:22.580
Cotton Candy has now made Starpeace its enemy.

21:25.580 --> 21:26.580
Sir.

21:27.550 --> 21:28.550
Do you know?

21:29.580 --> 21:32.720
That you're the only one reacting to our struggles

21:33.190 --> 21:34.890
for the past several years?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.790
Why are you so reckless?

21:39.790 --> 21:41.600
The result is obvious.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.300
I want to see if we really have no potential.

21:45.870 --> 21:47.940
That way, I can give up fair and square.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.540
Everything up until now was not enough?

21:51.810 --> 21:52.810
This

21:53.040 --> 21:55.180
isn't convinced yet.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.720
I see

22:02.750 --> 22:05.390
you'll need my assistance more than ever.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.690
So that heart

22:08.660 --> 22:10.790
will burst with conviction.

22:17.530 --> 22:19.530
Huh? Long time no see, Jenna.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.470
Yes, hello, Bbiyong.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.270
I'll be going now.

22:25.270 --> 22:26.310
You do that.

22:32.610 --> 22:34.680
Oh, Ji-han

22:35.120 --> 22:36.850
also okayed the song.

22:36.850 --> 22:38.090
Jeez.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.390
He's so picky.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.790
We did it! We did it!

22:50.460 --> 22:51.730
Shh!

22:54.240 --> 22:55.970
Yesterday and today

22:55.970 --> 22:59.570
The days are too short

22:59.570 --> 23:01.210
What the?

23:01.210 --> 23:02.810
Will tomorrow be different?

23:02.810 --> 23:07.210
Will the day I long for come?

23:07.210 --> 23:10.080
Shadows are drawn

23:10.080 --> 23:13.520
So I can't see the sky

23:13.520 --> 23:18.690
Will the day come when I blossom?

23:19.030 --> 23:21.230
The dream that was my everything

23:21.230 --> 23:24.870
I remember that thrill

23:24.870 --> 23:27.100
Don't let it hide you

23:27.100 --> 23:30.870
I leave my confined self behind

23:30.870 --> 23:33.170
Dark night blues

23:33.170 --> 23:37.240
Riding out the storm, I bloom

23:37.240 --> 23:42.350
When my time comes again

23:54.800 --> 23:57.360
When the darkness falls

23:57.360 --> 24:00.870
Even if I'm alone at night

24:00.870 --> 24:03.140
It'll be okay

24:03.140 --> 24:06.440
Even if I spend many nights crying

24:06.440 --> 24:09.410
It'll be dazzling

24:09.410 --> 24:11.350
Shine on my days

24:11.350 --> 24:13.280
Radiantly

24:13.280 --> 24:18.490
When the season I've been waiting for comes

24:24.290 --> 24:26.590
It's such a relief, right?

24:28.600 --> 24:29.600
Elle.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.720
What are you doing?

24:32.770 --> 24:33.770
You leaving?

24:33.930 --> 24:35.140
Are you leaving?

24:35.140 --> 24:36.200
I said it was the last time.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.310
CEO Cha gave his permission.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.440
All we have to do is stick to the plan.

24:39.440 --> 24:40.640
The plan?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.080
Is that even a plan?

24:45.710 --> 24:47.620
Becoming No.1 in a music show and disbanding.

24:49.650 --> 24:50.650
Fine.

24:50.880 --> 24:51.880
Listen up.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.850
Even if I do become No.1,

24:54.260 --> 24:56.290
I won't do it under Cotton Candy's name.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.290
You got it?

25:00.060 --> 25:01.460
Good luck.

25:04.570 --> 25:05.700
Bye.

25:09.470 --> 25:10.840
We don't have much time

25:10.840 --> 25:12.540
so I can't afford to try to stop you.

25:14.110 --> 25:15.740
If that's what you believe, then go.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.980
I hope you're successful.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.280
I mean it.

25:21.350 --> 25:22.620
Jenna.

25:22.780 --> 25:24.150
Thanks for everything.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.030
Elle!

25:35.260 --> 25:36.260
Elle.

26:24.210 --> 26:25.750
I told you once.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.850
That I support you no matter what.

26:32.520 --> 26:33.920
It's the same this time.

26:35.590 --> 26:37.060
These last few days,

26:37.490 --> 26:39.560
Elle wasn't with us.

26:40.660 --> 26:43.060
We all knew that,

26:43.360 --> 26:45.200
but we all ignored it.

26:46.130 --> 26:47.270
This time,

26:47.970 --> 26:50.340
we all knew we really

26:51.340 --> 26:52.940
couldn't stop Elle.

27:05.450 --> 27:07.820
You guys put yourselves in Jenna's shoes.

27:07.820 --> 27:09.990
What will be your best move?

27:11.360 --> 27:12.530
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

27:12.530 --> 27:13.590
The first album.

27:13.930 --> 27:15.300
A remake of the first album.

27:16.030 --> 27:17.200
- A remake?
- A remake?

27:17.200 --> 27:18.130
No.

27:18.130 --> 27:19.470
I won't do a remake.

27:19.470 --> 27:20.070
- What?
- What?

27:20.070 --> 27:20.930
Then what?

27:20.930 --> 27:23.000
We have a new song.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.300
- A new song?
- A new song?

27:24.670 --> 27:25.970
I'm sure they'll do a remake.

27:25.970 --> 27:27.940
But still, they won't be able to finish the songs

27:27.940 --> 27:29.740
with a high level of completion in time.

27:29.740 --> 27:31.510
Right. Plus they have no money.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.950
They'll use old songs.

27:34.850 --> 27:35.980
Asst. Manager Lee.

27:36.850 --> 27:38.350
What if it's a single?

27:38.450 --> 27:39.420
A single?

27:39.420 --> 27:40.350
Yeah.

27:40.650 --> 27:41.720
A digital single.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.430
Just one song as a digital single?

27:44.830 --> 27:45.960
I see.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.860
- That's it.
- Okay.

27:48.130 --> 27:49.130
Great!

27:49.660 --> 27:51.300
Let's focus our energy.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.000
Let's go all in!

27:53.830 --> 27:55.240
Okay, good.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.470
Let's do this!

27:56.470 --> 27:57.910
They can't use remake songs

27:58.010 --> 27:59.640
if we seize copyrights to the original songs?

27:59.640 --> 28:00.540
Yes.

28:00.540 --> 28:03.100
Find all the copyright holders of their 1st album

28:03.100 --> 28:04.410
and take action.

28:06.210 --> 28:07.650
Move now! Quick! Quick!

28:07.650 --> 28:08.850
Take care of it now! Quickly!

28:08.850 --> 28:09.850
Yes, Sir.

28:33.370 --> 28:34.370
It's good.

28:36.080 --> 28:36.810
So.

28:36.810 --> 28:39.480
You want trap beat as the base?

28:39.610 --> 28:40.050
Yeah.

28:40.050 --> 28:41.050
This

28:41.120 --> 28:43.380
is so different from your team's concept.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.720
Our first album didn't suit us.

28:47.660 --> 28:48.590
Hey.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.790
Why me?

28:49.790 --> 28:51.530
Frankly, in your situation,

28:51.530 --> 28:54.460
you can't afford a high level producer like me.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.800
If anyone says they'll do it,

28:57.800 --> 28:59.470
you should thank them.

28:59.870 --> 29:01.340
But you point me out?

29:02.340 --> 29:03.870
Because of our situation,

29:04.470 --> 29:06.440
we need a high level producer.

29:08.410 --> 29:09.410
And,

29:11.580 --> 29:12.980
for some reason,

29:14.050 --> 29:15.420
I thought you'd help us.

29:17.420 --> 29:19.850
Don't bet your life on uncertainties.

29:20.250 --> 29:23.020
You know I have no compassion.

29:23.020 --> 29:24.020
What's more,

29:24.260 --> 29:26.460
I'm Starpeace's leading producer.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.030
Technically,

29:28.200 --> 29:29.360
you and I

29:29.860 --> 29:30.830
are enemies.

29:40.740 --> 29:42.510
After turning you down yesterday,

29:42.810 --> 29:44.340
I felt bad.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.070
That's a pity.

29:47.450 --> 29:49.350
I understand your situation,

29:49.850 --> 29:52.650
but I have a lot of songs to work on.

29:53.220 --> 29:55.120
If you listen to it once...

29:55.120 --> 29:56.120
No.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.330
I won't be able to do it, so I won't listen.

30:02.430 --> 30:04.800
I felt apologetic toward CEO Ma.

30:08.770 --> 30:10.600
Okay, let's do it.

30:11.610 --> 30:15.380
Since you started it, go out with a bang.

30:16.940 --> 30:17.940
Thanks.

30:18.110 --> 30:19.850
Cheer up.

30:20.150 --> 30:23.250
I thought it weird that you guys never made it.

30:24.220 --> 30:25.340
Let's do this.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.330
But I heard Elle left the team.

30:32.830 --> 30:33.830
Yeah.

30:34.230 --> 30:35.600
So the vocals will be a bit...

30:35.600 --> 30:36.600
It's okay.

30:36.860 --> 30:38.930
I'll make it so it fits the four of you.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.500
Thanks, Bbiyong.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.130
You're new here?

31:08.860 --> 31:10.530
I'm the manager of the men's quarters.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.370
I'm studying for law school.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.370
Sure.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.600
If there's any inconvenience, just tell me.

31:17.900 --> 31:20.510
You know the rules on using the bathroom?

31:20.510 --> 31:21.410
Yes.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.240
Good.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.850
We sometimes get cockroaches.

31:27.250 --> 31:28.750
Don't scream.

31:28.750 --> 31:29.920
Just come and tell me.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.390
Then I'll come here

31:31.390 --> 31:33.920
and beat it dead with one whack.

31:34.420 --> 31:35.460
And over there...

31:38.290 --> 31:39.650
Nice to meet you.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.430
Did Bbiyong really take it?

31:45.870 --> 31:46.700
Yeah.

31:48.070 --> 31:49.440
That snaky dog?

31:49.770 --> 31:52.640
When he never said hi, treating us like dirt?

31:52.640 --> 31:54.910
I guess he was a good person.

31:55.110 --> 31:56.510
We got it all wrong.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.110
What about Stella?

31:58.680 --> 32:00.550
She's out earning rent.

32:00.550 --> 32:01.750
We have to give the agency 50%,

32:01.750 --> 32:03.480
then give the rest for rent.

32:04.220 --> 32:06.420
There can't be a more vicious person

32:06.420 --> 32:08.190
than that jerk.

32:08.190 --> 32:09.520
Should I kill him?

32:09.620 --> 32:11.530
No, reel it in.

32:12.090 --> 32:13.830
When will our song be ready?

32:13.830 --> 32:15.160
He knows we have a tight schedule.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.800
He'll get it done as soon as possible.

32:18.400 --> 32:19.330
Great.

32:19.330 --> 32:20.200
Then

32:20.200 --> 32:21.770
shall we start the visual concept work?

32:21.770 --> 32:22.770
No.

32:23.070 --> 32:24.400
There's something more important.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.940
Create a video account.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.280
Use the name Cotton Candy.

32:28.710 --> 32:29.740
And...

32:29.980 --> 32:31.280
- And?
- And?

32:31.850 --> 32:33.510
- Bust it out.
- Bust it out?

32:33.750 --> 32:34.950
Bust what out?

32:38.520 --> 32:39.450
Hello.

32:39.450 --> 32:40.290
Hello.

32:40.290 --> 32:41.320
Hi.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.490
This isn't good.

32:42.490 --> 32:43.490
What?

32:44.460 --> 32:47.430
Meeting the boss in the bathroom is awkward.

32:47.690 --> 32:51.000
Well, you're the one always complaining.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.070
What's wrong with your lips?

32:54.840 --> 32:56.040
My lips?

32:56.040 --> 32:57.500
Why do you think?

32:58.210 --> 33:00.740
Perhaps I kissed someone really hard.

33:00.970 --> 33:02.840
How dare you say that!

33:04.850 --> 33:06.650
Why are you getting mad at me?

33:06.980 --> 33:09.220
I should be the one getting mad.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.550
These lips? I'll explain.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.290
I haven't been able to sleep,

33:13.290 --> 33:14.450
cleaning up your messes.

33:14.450 --> 33:16.190
So I got cold sores on my lips.

33:16.360 --> 33:17.790
My lips are getting busted up,

33:17.790 --> 33:18.630
but you've forgotten all about it.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.430
Just going around la-di-da.

33:20.830 --> 33:21.830
Also,

33:21.830 --> 33:23.760
let's say I really did kiss someone.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.230
Is that something to berate me about?

33:26.930 --> 33:29.070
Don't joke about those things at work.

33:29.270 --> 33:31.470
This isn't a Buddhist temple in the Joseon Era.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.370
why can't I say "kiss?"

33:33.740 --> 33:34.710
A remake?

33:34.710 --> 33:35.480
Yes.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.340
That's their only option.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.380
I was quick to block all the sound sources,

33:39.380 --> 33:41.180
taking preemptive actions,

33:41.180 --> 33:42.650
so you can be as you are now.

33:42.850 --> 33:44.280
Just la-di-da.

33:44.280 --> 33:46.650
You keep saying that. What do you mean?

33:46.650 --> 33:47.720
You curious?

33:48.050 --> 33:49.220
If you are,

33:49.520 --> 33:50.790
give me four dollars.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.660
They have a song.

33:55.130 --> 33:56.430
What are you talking about?

33:58.930 --> 34:00.470
A new song.

34:00.470 --> 34:01.830
Kim Jenna has it.

34:08.340 --> 34:09.409
Well...

34:20.650 --> 34:21.650
Bbiyong.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.620
How about putting in a more groovy vibe?

34:24.889 --> 34:27.060
More groovy?

34:41.139 --> 34:42.409
It...

34:43.139 --> 34:44.639
It seems a little bland.

34:47.580 --> 34:48.880
More pizzazz?

34:48.880 --> 34:49.880
Yeah.

35:02.830 --> 35:03.700
Sounds good.

35:03.700 --> 35:04.730
Like this.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.700
I also want the synth to build up gradually.

35:07.700 --> 35:10.440
Put in a strong kick before the drop

35:10.440 --> 35:11.910
and a bang like an explosion.

35:11.910 --> 35:15.640
During the build up, pull the other sounds back,

35:15.640 --> 35:17.610
then add one by one, raising the tension,

35:17.610 --> 35:19.180
then before the drop, whip it all up,

35:19.180 --> 35:20.250
shout it all out,

35:20.250 --> 35:24.150
then with the drop, I want a full explosion.

35:24.150 --> 35:25.190
Sounds good.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.260
Okay.

35:29.890 --> 35:33.230
If you knew that, you should've told me!

35:33.230 --> 35:35.560
It's doesn't call for a company-wide response.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.830
Sir!

35:36.830 --> 35:38.570
Sir?

35:38.730 --> 35:40.430
- Umm...
- What?

35:40.430 --> 35:41.900
You have to see this.

35:42.570 --> 35:46.670
So we've decided to do this crazy thing.

35:46.740 --> 35:49.640
Although no one believes in or roots for us...

35:49.640 --> 35:51.180
Especially our agency!

35:51.180 --> 35:52.450
Director Yoon.

35:53.180 --> 35:54.950
We've decided to give it a go.

35:55.820 --> 35:59.390
Pray for us that everything we face on the way

35:59.390 --> 36:00.290
will only make us stronger.

36:00.290 --> 36:04.490
We'll update our situation like a daily vlog.

36:04.490 --> 36:08.500
Each vlog will probably be a short soap opera,

36:09.860 --> 36:12.370
so you won't want to miss the next one.

36:13.800 --> 36:14.800
I hope.

36:15.770 --> 36:18.240
Here's the first notice.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.910
We're looking for the 26 people.

36:20.910 --> 36:24.210
2016, on the day Cotton Candy debuted,

36:22.410 --> 36:24.710
Failed to log-in long term
Due to long-term failure in logging in,
you must pass a verification process.

36:24.410 --> 36:26.310
you became our first fans.

36:24.710 --> 36:28.110
Long-term no log-in verification process

36:26.750 --> 36:28.750
You loved us unconditionally.

36:28.880 --> 36:31.480
Website manager: Absent
Members: 26 / Visitors: 1

36:29.420 --> 36:31.420
But in the end, we betrayed you.

36:31.420 --> 36:33.650
We are looking for those 26 fans called "Candies."

36:34.390 --> 36:36.760
Give us a chance to repay your kindness,

36:36.760 --> 36:38.660
please.

36:41.090 --> 36:45.100
So there's no need for a company-wide response?

36:45.600 --> 36:48.000
Jenna is really clever.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.300
She started with a narrative.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.900
People will be interested.

36:50.900 --> 36:52.540
People love a good story.

36:52.540 --> 36:55.510
Persecution, victim, expendables...

36:55.510 --> 36:58.080
People will feel that it's unfair.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.880
They'll be quick to sympathize.

37:00.880 --> 37:04.520
If they succeed, isn't it good for us, too?

37:04.520 --> 37:05.790
What if they don't?

37:06.290 --> 37:07.620
What if they don't?

37:07.620 --> 37:09.460
They cause all the trouble they can

37:09.860 --> 37:11.890
and create all sorts of malicious gossip...

37:12.530 --> 37:13.530
Oh!

37:15.000 --> 37:16.900
We'll get caught on the tip of Reporter Mo's pen.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.630
How fortunate for us!

37:22.940 --> 37:24.970
But in the end, we betrayed you.

37:24.970 --> 37:27.340
We are looking for those 26 fans called "Candies."

37:28.270 --> 37:29.580
Give us a chance...

37:29.580 --> 37:32.450
I guess Jenna is really going to do it.

37:33.010 --> 37:34.710
How did the CEO allow this?

37:34.710 --> 37:37.750
It seems you weren't really needed.

37:38.950 --> 37:40.630
Do you feel better now?

37:46.160 --> 37:49.760
Pray for us that everything we face on the way

37:49.760 --> 37:50.800
will only make us stronger.

37:50.800 --> 37:54.800
We'll update our situation like a daily vlog.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.870
That was close!

37:57.870 --> 37:58.970
You're going home now?

38:02.610 --> 38:04.040
Why didn't you tell me?

38:04.780 --> 38:05.980
That you're an idol singer?

38:06.180 --> 38:08.650
I thought you were different.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.720
People say celebrities have a different mold.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.350
They weren't wrong.

38:12.520 --> 38:13.920
Great.

38:14.290 --> 38:15.590
Crazy bastard.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.630
Sing a song for me one day!

38:19.790 --> 38:20.690
Huh?

38:40.410 --> 38:41.690
Taking medicine?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.350
Yeah.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.550
I have a slight cold.

38:46.620 --> 38:49.320
How do we get more views?

38:49.760 --> 38:51.120
Are you going to work?

38:51.460 --> 38:52.460
Yeah.

38:52.590 --> 38:55.200
They won't take 50% of delivering chickens, right?

38:55.460 --> 38:58.570
They might say you're doing it thanks to them.

38:59.130 --> 39:00.130
Oh, right.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.970
The song will come out today, right?

39:01.970 --> 39:03.070
What did Bbiyong say?

39:03.070 --> 39:04.300
Did he say it's good?

39:04.400 --> 39:05.670
He said come to the studio first.

39:05.940 --> 39:07.410
He was very confident.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.310
This is brilliant.

39:13.880 --> 39:14.880
It's my mom.

39:16.050 --> 39:18.490
It's still a storm front over there.

39:18.850 --> 39:21.450
No. I'm at the dorm.

39:23.690 --> 39:24.990
Mom.

39:25.330 --> 39:27.260
We need the car.

39:27.630 --> 39:28.630
Mom!

39:35.770 --> 39:37.840
My mom told me to bring the car

39:37.840 --> 39:39.410
or go to a TV show audition.

39:43.580 --> 39:44.780
I'm heading out.

39:44.780 --> 39:45.550
Okay, fight on!

39:45.550 --> 39:46.550
Thanks!

39:48.280 --> 39:50.520
Hey, should we keep writing comments?

40:02.230 --> 40:05.730
Honey, honey, I love you

40:05.730 --> 40:10.300
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, baby

40:10.300 --> 40:14.170
When all is said and done, I love you so much

40:14.170 --> 40:18.080
- Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, baby
- He must be mad.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.880
Focus on driving, please.

40:20.310 --> 40:21.180
Okay.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.650
Seriously,

40:23.720 --> 40:26.290
if the two of you scowl so much,

40:26.290 --> 40:28.450
what will the foundation think?

40:28.450 --> 40:30.660
Won't they think you came reluctantly?

40:31.960 --> 40:33.430
By the way,

40:33.430 --> 40:36.560
you don't look that disgruntled about this charity.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.300
Disgruntled? Why would I be?

40:38.300 --> 40:39.670
Because it's a charity.

40:39.670 --> 40:40.670
Bingo!

40:40.830 --> 40:44.900
Charity, charity, it's charity

40:44.900 --> 40:47.710
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, baby

41:00.820 --> 41:02.090
Twelfth floor.

41:07.590 --> 41:08.860
First floor.

41:15.370 --> 41:18.470
I'm so grateful you suggested this first.

41:18.570 --> 41:20.770
The kids will love it.

41:22.140 --> 41:22.880
Tenth floor.

41:22.880 --> 41:23.810
Wait!

41:23.810 --> 41:25.880
Wait! Wait! Wait!

41:26.050 --> 41:28.780
Oh, what a coincidence!

41:28.780 --> 41:30.350
Hi, Ji-han.

41:30.350 --> 41:31.380
How did you know where to find us?

41:31.380 --> 41:32.550
The doors are closing.

41:32.550 --> 41:34.290
Hello. You're CEO Cha Jae-hyuk, right?

41:34.290 --> 41:36.790
I'm Mo Ga-jin at IssueN24.

41:36.790 --> 41:38.590
Yes, I'm Cha Jae-hyuk.

41:38.590 --> 41:40.430
We only need photos. Why'd you come?

41:40.430 --> 41:43.100
Since you're not disclosing the event.

41:43.500 --> 41:46.070
A charity event for the underprivileged.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.430
This year's the third time, right?

41:47.430 --> 41:48.400
There was a press release.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.540
Stop asking when you already know.

41:49.540 --> 41:53.440
- Seventh floor.
- The members take turns choosing the recipients.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.310
- The planning is good.
- Seventh floor.

41:55.310 --> 41:57.380
There's no reason not to disclose the event.

41:57.380 --> 41:58.580
It's to protect the recipients

41:58.580 --> 42:01.580
- and for me not to have so much work.
- Oh, no! I have to get on!

42:01.580 --> 42:03.180
Come on, Director Yoon!

42:03.180 --> 42:04.350
Open up, open up!

42:04.350 --> 42:05.750
Reporters.

42:05.950 --> 42:07.650
The doors are closing.

42:11.560 --> 42:12.890
Tenth floor.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.430
Here we are.

42:17.930 --> 42:18.970
The doors are closing.

42:18.970 --> 42:20.130
Go on ahead.

42:25.510 --> 42:27.240
Twelfth floor.

42:31.880 --> 42:33.010
Good.

42:33.210 --> 42:34.850
I was going to call you.

42:36.320 --> 42:39.120
Earning money to eat is more urgent.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.850
What's urgent is the rent.

42:41.050 --> 42:42.520
My stomach can bear it,

42:42.520 --> 42:44.290
but the landlord is merciless.

42:47.490 --> 42:49.000
I think I'll get caught in the inspection

42:49.000 --> 42:50.460
for putting such a low price on it.

42:50.460 --> 42:51.860
If it's a problem, raise it.

42:51.860 --> 42:54.000
Don't show off with something so petty.

42:55.970 --> 42:57.770
You won't back down at all.

43:00.870 --> 43:02.010
Don't touch me.

43:02.010 --> 43:04.480
Then did you smack my lips with my permission?

43:05.240 --> 43:06.250
That's...

43:06.250 --> 43:07.410
I apologized...

43:07.410 --> 43:08.720
No, you didn't.

43:09.950 --> 43:11.680
Come to the office by two on Wednesday.

43:11.820 --> 43:12.620
What?

43:12.620 --> 43:13.620
Hand.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.030
Wednesday 2 PM, Office

43:25.470 --> 43:27.570
What are you doing? The chicken's getting cold.

43:27.570 --> 43:28.570
Go.

43:32.870 --> 43:34.710
The doors are closing.

43:45.950 --> 43:48.290
Wednesday 2 PM, Office

43:56.930 --> 43:57.860
I'm a bit angry.

43:57.860 --> 43:58.670
What are you doing?

43:58.670 --> 44:00.730
I let you exploit me to this extent.

44:01.070 --> 44:02.740
But you're still carrying a bag of chickens.

44:02.740 --> 44:03.900
Seo Ji-han.

44:04.600 --> 44:05.910
Are you picking a fight with me?

44:05.910 --> 44:07.310
Ji-han!

44:07.740 --> 44:09.210
Ji-han!

44:10.910 --> 44:12.780
Ji-han!

44:12.780 --> 44:14.210
Ji-han!

44:14.710 --> 44:17.420
I distinctly saw him come here.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.520
Ji-han!

44:21.520 --> 44:24.860
I have a few things to ask you.

44:26.090 --> 44:27.430
You're not here?

44:31.830 --> 44:34.570
I distinctly saw him come here.

44:40.140 --> 44:41.810
Ji-han!

44:44.710 --> 44:46.550
Ji-han!

44:54.750 --> 44:57.560
Are you in here?

45:01.790 --> 45:03.060
What are you doing?

45:04.530 --> 45:05.970
That's the women's restroom.

45:05.970 --> 45:08.030
Oh, uh...

45:08.030 --> 45:10.900
I was seeing if Seo Ji-han was hiding here.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.370
I'm also looking for Ji-han,

45:13.610 --> 45:15.640
but he's not so senseless to hide

45:15.640 --> 45:17.040
in the women's restroom.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.840
Right.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.980
I guess I went too far.

45:21.710 --> 45:22.980
But CEO Cha.

45:23.180 --> 45:24.550
That day in the park...

45:24.550 --> 45:26.720
What happened with that woman?

45:27.420 --> 45:28.350
Oh.

45:28.350 --> 45:30.720
I was there by chance.

45:31.690 --> 45:33.360
Director Yoon didn't know.

45:33.360 --> 45:35.760
That you and that woman...

45:36.500 --> 45:37.700
did that.

45:38.030 --> 45:39.400
You're not dating, are you?

45:39.400 --> 45:41.900
Director Yoon said no.

45:42.130 --> 45:44.770
It looked like she was hitting on you.

45:44.770 --> 45:48.640
Don't worry. I'm not going to write about it.

45:48.640 --> 45:50.340
It's not news-worthy.

45:50.340 --> 45:52.250
Thank you.

45:52.250 --> 45:54.580
But after that, I got curious about Cotton Candy

45:54.580 --> 45:56.280
so I looked them up.

45:56.480 --> 45:58.650
They were Starpeace's first group.

45:58.850 --> 46:01.950
It was the late CEO Ma's first project,

46:01.950 --> 46:03.860
but the response wasn't good.

46:03.860 --> 46:07.530
They made their own channel recently.

46:07.530 --> 46:08.930
They said

46:08.930 --> 46:12.230
they'll become No.1 in a music show and disband.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.570
If you're interviewing me,

46:14.770 --> 46:16.400
talk with Director Yoon.

46:16.400 --> 46:18.300
That's not it.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.700
I'm telling you to be careful.

46:21.730 --> 46:22.280
What?

46:22.280 --> 46:24.640
There are a lot of kids like that in show biz.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.710
They're ruined with no future,

46:26.710 --> 46:27.970
but they're celebrities,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.220
so their heads are up in the clouds.

46:30.780 --> 46:34.350
You came from the States, so you don't know.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.330
"He'll bite if I dangle something in front of him."

46:36.350 --> 46:37.830
They think that and approach you.

46:37.870 --> 46:40.410
You're their CEO so you're accessible.

46:40.560 --> 46:42.700
If they put their mind to it, it's easy.

46:43.090 --> 46:44.090
Jeez.

46:44.330 --> 46:46.200
I'm sorry if I offended you.

46:46.230 --> 46:48.630
Since you say you're not dating her.

46:48.760 --> 46:50.970
I couldn't understand what happened that day.

46:50.970 --> 46:52.860
So I had many thoughts.

46:53.070 --> 46:55.840
To be frank,

46:57.060 --> 46:59.190
I hope they get what they want.

46:59.700 --> 47:03.280
That way, my material sees the light of day.

47:03.300 --> 47:04.220
Material?

47:04.220 --> 47:05.530
Unfortunately,

47:05.920 --> 47:08.450
that day I had my camera with me.

47:08.450 --> 47:09.270
Reporter Mo!

47:09.270 --> 47:10.150
Oh.

47:10.830 --> 47:13.290
Don't worry. I won't be using it.

47:13.480 --> 47:14.490
Unless they become popular.

47:14.490 --> 47:15.240
Reporter Mo!

47:15.240 --> 47:17.350
Oh, Director Yoon! I was looking for you.

47:17.350 --> 47:19.530
What are you so curious about? Huh?

47:20.060 --> 47:21.850
Why did you leave my side?

47:21.850 --> 47:24.500
I said I was looking for you.

48:05.490 --> 48:06.490
Hey!

48:06.910 --> 48:08.310
Have you still not come to your senses?

48:08.310 --> 48:09.520
Why were you silent?

48:09.540 --> 48:09.990
What?

48:09.990 --> 48:12.450
Jenna was being treated as a hustler. You let him!

48:12.450 --> 48:14.460
Who let this happen in the first place?

48:14.460 --> 48:15.740
You're an adult!

48:19.780 --> 48:21.270
You're an adult.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.380
You should've done something.

49:23.180 --> 49:24.180
Bbiyong.

49:24.470 --> 49:26.720
Did it come out well? How is it? Do you like it?

49:27.120 --> 49:28.860
Take a breath first.

49:29.320 --> 49:31.620
You should like it, not me.

49:35.670 --> 49:36.670
Listen.

49:56.690 --> 49:58.610
Why? You don't like it?

49:58.940 --> 49:59.940
Bbiyong.

50:00.100 --> 50:01.780
- Why is...
- That concept

50:01.890 --> 50:03.620
isn't right for your group.

50:04.910 --> 50:06.430
I thought hard.

50:06.900 --> 50:09.030
You are sugar pop material.

50:17.030 --> 50:17.800
Bbiyong.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.450
I thought really hard.

50:19.450 --> 50:20.220
Hey.

50:20.290 --> 50:23.620
We're not just a business relationship.

50:24.550 --> 50:26.950
Since I said I'll produce your song,

50:27.060 --> 50:29.460
you and I are in this together.

50:29.730 --> 50:30.850
It's my job to help you

50:30.870 --> 50:32.570
do better what you do best.

50:34.260 --> 50:35.260
I know.

50:36.080 --> 50:37.080
But...

50:43.900 --> 50:44.900
Okay.

50:46.570 --> 50:47.690
I'll re-do it.

50:51.160 --> 50:52.160
I'm sorry.

50:54.590 --> 50:56.760
I guess I was taking the easy path.

50:58.280 --> 50:59.280
I admit it.

50:59.580 --> 51:00.940
I'll do it again.

51:17.480 --> 51:18.480
What's this?

51:19.500 --> 51:21.720
Du-ho's favorite thing.

51:22.220 --> 51:23.130
What?

51:23.130 --> 51:24.570
You didn't send it to his hometown?

51:25.380 --> 51:28.000
I was going to hold onto it a bit longer.

51:28.850 --> 51:30.780
I'll send it when it hurts less.

51:36.530 --> 51:37.530
This

51:38.210 --> 51:40.350
is a memento left by his mother.

51:44.830 --> 51:46.840
Wow, this still exists?

51:48.560 --> 51:49.560
This

51:50.190 --> 51:52.190
is a gift his mom's first love

51:52.210 --> 51:53.860
gave her.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.400
In high school,

51:56.440 --> 51:59.130
whenever a song he liked came on the radio,

51:59.130 --> 52:01.100
he recorded it and gave it to her.

52:01.900 --> 52:02.970
That's incredible.

52:05.670 --> 52:06.670
So

52:06.720 --> 52:09.520
his mom kept what her first love gave her?

52:11.430 --> 52:13.230
That's so romantic.

52:13.460 --> 52:14.460
Right?

52:14.880 --> 52:16.750
That's why they're together.

52:17.500 --> 52:18.500
What?

52:19.320 --> 52:21.050
When Du-ho was in junior high,

52:21.050 --> 52:23.780
she met her first love by chance.

52:24.330 --> 52:26.450
She had an affair, and ran away with him.

52:29.410 --> 52:30.410
What?

52:32.480 --> 52:33.770
You said it was a memento.

52:33.770 --> 52:34.770
Yeah.

52:35.340 --> 52:36.730
Du-ho said that

52:37.340 --> 52:39.120
he considers her dead.

52:41.150 --> 52:42.830
Why are you so surprised?

52:43.240 --> 52:45.460
A lot of people have affairs.

52:46.550 --> 52:50.420
My dad also had an affair and left.

52:50.930 --> 52:53.000
My mom and that woman's husband

52:53.390 --> 52:55.390
went around together trying to catch them,

52:55.390 --> 52:57.020
then fell in love and left, too.

52:57.490 --> 53:00.940
Is that why you were at the orphanage?

53:02.440 --> 53:03.440
Yeah.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.320
My mom left me there.

53:09.300 --> 53:12.370
Only my grandma went through so much to find me.

53:13.790 --> 53:14.790
Then

53:15.260 --> 53:17.270
when you met Jenna...

53:19.340 --> 53:21.070
That was when I was older.

53:22.130 --> 53:24.580
My grandma found me and raised me.

53:24.790 --> 53:26.610
Then she got sick and

53:26.730 --> 53:28.940
entrusted me to the orphanage.

53:30.010 --> 53:31.430
That's when I met her.

53:33.940 --> 53:35.860
Let's listen to it.

53:37.620 --> 53:39.300
Don't speak like that.

53:39.780 --> 53:40.780
Huh?

53:41.300 --> 53:43.770
Don't speak as if you're okay with it.

53:45.620 --> 53:47.460
You're not okay with it.

53:48.450 --> 53:49.450
So...

53:50.800 --> 53:52.480
Don't speak like that.

53:58.970 --> 54:00.250
It's about here.

54:01.140 --> 54:02.140
Right here.

54:03.210 --> 54:05.190
When I wasn't okay with it,

54:07.370 --> 54:09.220
I sang this with Du-ho.

54:10.510 --> 54:17.500
Even though I loved you, I was still lonely

54:17.830 --> 54:24.200
Inconsolable sadness made me choke up

54:24.560 --> 54:31.480
Like a doll in a dark corner of a room

54:31.840 --> 54:38.160
I blankly look out the window

54:38.530 --> 54:45.300
Just as it was the first time I saw you

54:45.770 --> 54:52.130
I wanted you to stay in my heart

54:52.740 --> 54:59.540
But we each dreamt of a different kind of love

54:59.990 --> 55:06.220
So I couldn't get close to your heart

55:07.610 --> 55:10.490
Although I loved you, nothing changed

55:10.490 --> 55:12.240
It only felt cruel that the weight

55:12.240 --> 55:14.040
of our hearts were different

55:14.040 --> 55:15.630
I'm going to let you go with a smile

55:15.630 --> 55:17.670
I thought I'd feel lighthearted

55:17.740 --> 55:20.810
But why is my heart heavy with so many thoughts?

55:21.210 --> 55:25.060
That mountain, sky and sunset are always there

55:25.400 --> 55:27.460
at my window

55:28.110 --> 55:34.650
Red lips bump together, bruising, turning black

55:35.340 --> 55:41.630
I'm in sad love as you drift away

55:42.040 --> 55:48.910
I feel small, and turn to walk away

55:46.180 --> 55:48.820
Sunshine Mental Health Clinic

55:49.180 --> 55:55.130
Now there is no more sadness

55:56.210 --> 56:01.920
I now know your heart

56:03.150 --> 56:08.990
Don't say you had loved me

56:10.220 --> 56:15.740
Show me your smile until the end

56:33.390 --> 56:34.920
I wanted to be successful.

56:36.720 --> 56:39.190
I wanted my name to be really famous.

56:39.730 --> 56:42.350
So that they'd come find me, begging.

56:43.080 --> 56:46.480
Saying they're sorry, that they were wrong.

56:49.470 --> 56:52.760
If they begged me to give them money,

56:56.000 --> 56:57.500
I'd say, "Get lost!"

56:59.970 --> 57:01.110
Get lost!

57:02.190 --> 57:04.880
Get lost! All of you, get lost!

57:19.750 --> 57:21.750
Your call cannot go through.

57:21.780 --> 57:23.780
Please leave a message...

57:25.980 --> 57:28.370
How is the song coming along?

57:28.800 --> 57:30.540
When will you be finished?

57:33.030 --> 57:34.430
Is he still not done?

57:35.620 --> 57:37.490
He said it'll be done today.

57:37.900 --> 57:39.290
But he's not picking up.

57:39.990 --> 57:41.680
He canceled so many times already.

57:42.270 --> 57:44.280
It'll be a problem if there's too much delay.

57:44.800 --> 57:47.210
Let's go through the visual concept references

57:47.210 --> 57:48.570
and analyze them.

57:49.490 --> 57:50.490
Okay.

57:52.330 --> 57:53.330
Yes?

57:58.080 --> 57:59.080
You're here.

57:59.110 --> 58:00.100
I'll be brief.

58:00.100 --> 58:01.890
- The reason I asked you to come...
- Sir...

58:07.520 --> 58:09.640
About the incident of kissing you...

58:09.820 --> 58:11.620
I thought I had apologized.

58:12.910 --> 58:14.490
It's a bit late, but I'm sorry.

58:15.620 --> 58:17.660
Aren't you going to apologize for threatening me?

58:19.280 --> 58:20.280
No.

58:20.300 --> 58:21.940
Unbelievable.

58:23.970 --> 58:25.330
I saw your video.

58:25.470 --> 58:27.270
That's why I called you in.

58:27.530 --> 58:29.410
I now realize

58:30.040 --> 58:31.430
what you really want.

58:32.640 --> 58:34.520
I'll say the sincerity in your video

58:34.980 --> 58:36.320
moved me.

58:37.020 --> 58:37.910
What?

58:39.060 --> 58:42.260
Director Yoon said there can't be a precedent.

58:42.350 --> 58:44.530
But I made a decision at my own discretion.

58:51.220 --> 58:53.420

58:58.940 --> 59:00.050
You did a lot

59:00.130 --> 59:02.250
as the leader, so you get KRW 100 million.

59:02.250 --> 59:05.510
A total of KRW 300 mil. will be paid as severance.

59:06.250 --> 59:08.440
It's an unprecedented amount...

59:12.040 --> 59:13.290
What the heck are you doing?

59:13.310 --> 59:14.210
You are...

59:14.210 --> 59:16.690
- You don't even understand my good will!
- ...lousy!

59:17.010 --> 59:20.210
You're a really lousy person!

59:27.360 --> 59:28.360
Kim Jenna.

59:28.590 --> 59:29.590
Kim Jenna.

59:29.830 --> 59:31.100
Kim Jenna!

59:36.030 --> 59:39.570
I know what I did to you was lousy, too.

59:39.570 --> 59:42.010
But we have nothing!

59:42.140 --> 59:44.510
We don't want to be lousy!

59:44.640 --> 59:46.380
But there was no other choice.

59:46.380 --> 59:47.680
But you...

59:47.780 --> 59:50.620
You have a lot.

59:50.850 --> 59:52.750
You don't have to be so lousy.

59:52.750 --> 59:53.520
Kim Jenna.

59:53.520 --> 59:56.020
We just want a very small opportunity!

59:56.020 --> 59:57.890
This isn't such a simple matter!

59:57.890 --> 1:00:01.260
You can make it into a simple matter!

1:00:05.930 --> 1:00:08.170
What we really want?

1:00:08.430 --> 1:00:09.940
You think it was money?

1:00:10.270 --> 1:00:12.370
You think we put on a show just to get

1:00:12.370 --> 1:00:14.310
one more penny from the agency?

1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:20.950
Just wait and see.

1:00:21.350 --> 1:00:23.020
See how we pull this off.

1:00:30.390 --> 1:00:31.490
Also,

1:00:32.220 --> 1:00:34.190
what Reporter Mo said was bull crap.

1:00:42.230 --> 1:00:42.730
I got it! I got it! I got it!

1:00:42.730 --> 1:00:43.940
Wait! Wait! Wait!

1:00:46.540 --> 1:00:47.980
Get some practice.

1:00:48.870 --> 1:00:50.670
Cotton Candy Kim Jenna

1:00:51.740 --> 1:00:53.250
She's calling again?

1:00:53.250 --> 1:00:54.950
The headache of a job you had.

1:00:54.950 --> 1:00:55.910
Is that over?

1:00:55.910 --> 1:00:56.850
Yeah...

1:00:57.280 --> 1:00:57.850
No.

1:00:57.850 --> 1:00:58.970
Crazy bastard.

1:00:59.150 --> 1:01:01.350
Are you saying yes or no?

1:01:01.350 --> 1:01:02.350
Let's see.

1:01:02.690 --> 1:01:04.490
The time of the dog and wolf

1:01:04.490 --> 1:01:06.220
is continuing like the white night.

1:01:07.830 --> 1:01:10.400
What if they take it to someone else?

1:01:10.730 --> 1:01:11.630
Them?

1:01:11.630 --> 1:01:12.500
Hey.

1:01:12.500 --> 1:01:13.800
You think they're idiots?

1:01:13.970 --> 1:01:15.900
They won't kick away good fortune.

1:01:21.070 --> 1:01:22.370
Seriously.

1:01:24.310 --> 1:01:25.380
Lousy?

1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:29.110
Me?

1:01:29.550 --> 1:01:30.650
Also,

1:01:30.650 --> 1:01:32.050
what Reporter Mo said was bull crap.

1:01:32.050 --> 1:01:35.990
You came from the States, so you don't know.

1:01:35.990 --> 1:01:37.920
"He'll bite if I dangle something in front of him."

1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:39.720
They think that and approach you.

1:01:47.770 --> 1:01:48.370
Kim Jenna

1:01:50.410 --> 1:01:52.300
The line is busy...

1:01:57.140 --> 1:01:59.080
The line is busy...

1:02:02.810 --> 1:02:05.850
Your call cannot go through...

1:02:08.450 --> 1:02:13.050
What Reporter Mo said...

1:02:19.260 --> 1:02:19.830
Starpeace Bbiyong

1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:24.540
Yes, Sir?

1:02:24.540 --> 1:02:26.220
Where are you right now?

1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:28.440
I have to talk to you about Cotton Candy.

1:02:32.810 --> 1:02:35.410
CEO Cha

1:02:33.580 --> 1:02:36.520
I know what Reporter Mo said was bull crap.

1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:38.780
The severance

1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:41.120
was not because of the bull crap.

1:02:44.690 --> 1:02:45.990
Hyun-ji!

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:47.660
Jenna!

1:02:48.730 --> 1:02:50.330
What brings you here?

1:02:51.230 --> 1:02:55.000
I got frustrated because he keeps making excuses.

1:02:55.100 --> 1:02:57.740
He needs to get a taste of my fire.

1:02:58.540 --> 1:02:59.270
Let's go.

1:02:59.270 --> 1:03:00.470
Wait for me.

1:03:02.310 --> 1:03:03.380
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1:03:03.380 --> 1:03:05.140
- Whoa.
- Your back!

1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:06.580
Bbiyong.

1:03:08.110 --> 1:03:09.380
What the?

1:03:09.380 --> 1:03:11.350
You didn't pick up because you were gaming?

1:03:20.090 --> 1:03:21.160
What's this?

1:03:21.290 --> 1:03:23.860
This is what we usually do.

1:03:24.130 --> 1:03:25.100
Bbiyong.

1:03:25.330 --> 1:03:26.670
Just keep listening.

1:03:26.670 --> 1:03:28.030
I tweaked it.

1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:29.400
It'll be different.

1:03:33.770 --> 1:03:34.810
Bbiyong.

1:03:37.510 --> 1:03:38.440
Jenna.

1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:41.150
I was up all night, and thought a lot about it.

1:03:41.780 --> 1:03:44.750
No matter what, this is right for you.

1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:46.650
Don't you know changing your concept on a whim

1:03:46.650 --> 1:03:48.330
is extremely dangerous?

1:03:52.690 --> 1:03:53.810
I'll re-do it.

1:04:02.770 --> 1:04:04.200
Let's draw the line here.

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.000
I'm sorry.

1:04:09.740 --> 1:04:10.740
It's okay.

1:04:11.110 --> 1:04:11.980
I'll do it again.

1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:12.980
No.

1:04:13.810 --> 1:04:15.150
It's stressful for you

1:04:15.780 --> 1:04:17.280
and we have no time.

1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:20.520
It's not stressful for me.

1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:21.350
Hey.

1:04:21.750 --> 1:04:23.820
You need the Bbiyong premium.

1:04:23.820 --> 1:04:25.660
I'll give up that premium.

1:04:27.490 --> 1:04:29.060
Thanks for everything.

1:04:31.860 --> 1:04:32.860
Let's go.

1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:36.330
You're still such a shrew.

1:04:43.270 --> 1:04:44.210
What?

1:04:44.540 --> 1:04:46.680
You can give up my premium?

1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:49.250
That ridiculous pride hasn't died down yet?

1:04:51.450 --> 1:04:52.280
Hey.

1:04:52.850 --> 1:04:54.990
This is why you can't make it.

1:04:55.220 --> 1:04:56.660
That zombie pride.

1:04:57.720 --> 1:04:58.990
Have you lost your mind?

1:04:58.990 --> 1:05:01.730
What? No.1 on a music show and disband?

1:05:01.730 --> 1:05:02.730
Jeez.

1:05:02.730 --> 1:05:04.400
Are you an attention seeker?

1:05:04.600 --> 1:05:05.680
CEO Ma will be so ashamed

1:05:05.710 --> 1:05:06.940
he'll jump out of his grave.

1:05:06.970 --> 1:05:07.700
Hey!

1:05:07.700 --> 1:05:09.470
So stop.

1:05:09.900 --> 1:05:12.300
Don't disgrace the name of Starpeace.

1:05:13.770 --> 1:05:14.610
Hey.

1:05:15.140 --> 1:05:17.780
You shouldn't hit a rock with an egg.

1:05:18.710 --> 1:05:20.050
With an egg,

1:05:20.550 --> 1:05:21.850
you should make fried eggs.

1:05:28.150 --> 1:05:29.050
Bbiyong.

1:05:29.890 --> 1:05:31.460
Why are you doing this?

1:05:31.790 --> 1:05:33.430
You don't have to go so far.

1:05:33.430 --> 1:05:35.090
He's showing his true colors.

1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:36.800
I told you.

1:05:37.430 --> 1:05:39.730
This jerk looked down on us so much.

1:05:40.670 --> 1:05:41.630
Hey.

1:05:42.300 --> 1:05:44.040
Bbiyong or Bbong or whatever.

1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:44.740
You cow!

1:05:44.740 --> 1:05:46.300
Hey, Bong Chung-bong!

1:05:46.500 --> 1:05:48.940
Snap out of it!

1:05:49.440 --> 1:05:51.880
We're the beginning of Starpeace.

1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:56.280
I know when you used to totter around penniless.

1:05:56.280 --> 1:05:57.920
How dare you act so haughty?

1:05:58.550 --> 1:06:01.820
You slandered Troy to get into Starpeace.

1:06:01.820 --> 1:06:03.690
You were caught up in plagiarism disputes.

1:06:04.090 --> 1:06:06.190
Banging out plagiarized songs, Bong?

1:06:06.190 --> 1:06:07.330
You hussy!

1:06:07.330 --> 1:06:08.160
You insane?

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:09.130
Bbiyong.

1:06:09.830 --> 1:06:11.930
Go on! Hit me!

1:06:11.930 --> 1:06:14.000
Hit me, you douchebag!

1:06:14.200 --> 1:06:16.370
So I can get a settlement and buy me some snacks.

1:06:16.370 --> 1:06:18.540
Should I pay half of my settlement to the agency?

1:06:18.540 --> 1:06:19.400
Executive Bong Chung-bong?

1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:20.370
I said shut up!

1:06:20.370 --> 1:06:21.770
- Bbiyong!
- Stop it!

1:06:23.140 --> 1:06:25.140
What are you doing?

1:06:27.580 --> 1:06:29.280
You plagiarizing trash.

1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:30.580
Why you...

1:06:30.580 --> 1:06:32.420
I said stop it!

1:06:36.420 --> 1:06:37.420
Sir.

1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:40.530
You two, leave.

1:06:42.860 --> 1:06:44.540
You told me to do it.

1:06:49.570 --> 1:06:50.840
I don't believe this.

1:06:52.270 --> 1:06:55.310
Now you act like a good CEO?

1:06:59.510 --> 1:07:00.580
He told you?

1:07:01.810 --> 1:07:03.150
He told you to do it?

1:07:03.780 --> 1:07:04.850
Yeah.

1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:08.450
He told me to drag it out, then finish you.

1:07:09.050 --> 1:07:11.860
That was the agency's strategy, Sir.

1:07:12.460 --> 1:07:15.360
I just did what you told me to.

1:07:16.060 --> 1:07:17.930
Why are you making me out to be the bad guy?

1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:20.000
Finish us?

1:07:20.770 --> 1:07:22.030
What does he mean?

1:07:22.370 --> 1:07:24.170
Was he trying to kill us?

1:07:26.970 --> 1:07:28.410
I see

1:07:28.570 --> 1:07:31.280
you'll need my assistance more than ever.

1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:33.550
So that heart

1:07:34.550 --> 1:07:36.680
will burst with conviction.

1:07:36.980 --> 1:07:37.980
Assistance.

1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:41.790
So my heart will burst.

1:08:10.580 --> 1:08:13.180
IDOL
[IDOL: The Coup]

1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:15.950
Won't it be meaningful if you do the producing?

1:08:15.950 --> 1:08:17.060
We need more than meaning.

1:08:17.060 --> 1:08:17.720
It's been a long time.

1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:19.390
I guess I really did make it.

1:08:19.390 --> 1:08:20.290
Come back.

1:08:20.290 --> 1:08:21.189
We need you.

1:08:21.189 --> 1:08:22.689
Not that way.

1:08:22.689 --> 1:08:24.800
They can't even start a rumor.

1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:27.000
They're not even recyclable trash.

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:28.290
That's their plan.

1:08:28.290 --> 1:08:29.310
You think I'll get dragged into it?

1:08:29.330 --> 1:08:30.970
"Just come at us. We'll crush you."

1:08:30.970 --> 1:08:32.140
They're all like that.

1:08:32.140 --> 1:08:33.170
The agency said they want

1:08:33.170 --> 1:08:35.470
us to collab with Mars in the charity event.

1:08:35.470 --> 1:08:37.479
My wish was that you get ruined.

1:08:37.479 --> 1:08:38.279
Why would I help you?

1:08:38.279 --> 1:08:40.510
Your wish already came to pass a long time ago.

1:08:40.510 --> 1:08:42.380
Shut your mouth and get out.
