how far down does it go?

( chitters )

00:48.791 --> 00:52.375
Yeah right, "all the way."

00:53.250 --> 00:54.458
All right, Pieper.

Oof!

03:53.375 --> 03:54.208
Oh.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.166
Hey, wait!

04:13.208 --> 04:17.041
Man I forgot how beautiful
this place could be.

04:17.041 --> 04:19.000
The 99 Caverns.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.541
Slugball games.

04:20.541 --> 04:22.333
Undercorn fritters.

04:22.333 --> 04:25.583
Laying around the hideout!

04:25.583 --> 04:27.458
Home.

04:29.916 --> 04:31.833
The Eastern Caverns were great.

04:31.833 --> 04:33.291
But...

04:33.291 --> 04:35.708
I think we could all benefit
from a little less stress.

04:35.708 --> 04:38.500
And a 99 Caverns
with no Dr. Blakk

04:38.500 --> 04:42.541
and no ghouled slugs is just
the place to start!

04:42.541 --> 04:44.375
Pah! Nonsense.

04:44.375 --> 04:47.750
Heroes like Pronto thrive
on stress!

04:47.750 --> 04:51.416
The scent of perspiration
is the scent of glory!

04:51.416 --> 04:52.666
And Pronto is -

04:52.666 --> 04:54.083
( huge inhale )

04:54.083 --> 04:54.833
( gags )

04:54.833 --> 04:56.041
Ugh.

04:56.041 --> 04:58.416
-wreathed in glory!

04:58.416 --> 05:00.250
That's it! I'm leaving!

05:00.250 --> 05:02.500
And I'm never coming back!

05:02.500 --> 05:05.875
Oh come now, it
is not that bad!

05:05.875 --> 05:08.416
I don't think it's you,
Pronto.

05:08.416 --> 05:11.833
Does the town seem
a little empty?

05:11.833 --> 05:14.375
More like totally empty.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.875
Except for the King of Sling!

05:16.875 --> 05:18.291
The Shane Gang!

05:18.291 --> 05:20.208
Oh am I glad to see you.

05:20.208 --> 05:21.291
What's going on?

05:21.291 --> 05:23.958
Everything's outta control,
man!

05:23.958 --> 05:25.375
( chirping loudly )

05:25.375 --> 05:27.708
Woah. That is a ton of slugs.

05:27.708 --> 05:30.541
( chirping loudly )

05:30.541 --> 05:32.333
King -- what happened?

05:32.333 --> 05:34.916
We left you and The Shadow Clan
in charge.

05:34.916 --> 05:36.500
The Shadow Clan
is the problem!

05:36.500 --> 05:37.208
Huh?

05:37.208 --> 05:38.333
What've they done?

05:38.333 --> 05:39.666
What haven't they done?

05:39.666 --> 05:40.833
Most folks are more afraid

05:40.833 --> 05:43.208
a' those creepy,
Bug People than ever!

05:43.208 --> 05:46.083
And they don't like rockabilly
music, man!

05:46.083 --> 05:49.250
Ohhh, you do not wanna know.

05:49.250 --> 05:49.958
Oh.

05:49.958 --> 05:50.708
( clears throat )

05:50.708 --> 05:52.541
Of course, hehe.

05:52.541 --> 05:54.750
Koo-koooo.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.708
I don't like the sound of this,
bro.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.250
If the Shadow Clan are
getting confrontational,

05:59.250 --> 06:00.791
what're we gonna do?

06:00.791 --> 06:02.458
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

06:02.458 --> 06:03.916
I know The Shadow Clan.

06:03.916 --> 06:06.875
I don't think they'd do anything
hurtful on purpose.

06:06.875 --> 06:07.583
King.

06:07.583 --> 06:08.500
Explain what happened?

06:08.500 --> 06:10.500
From the beginning
this time.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.250
( sighs )

06:11.250 --> 06:12.750
Okay.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.375
Well things went downhill-
-as soon as you left.

06:24.625 --> 06:25.791
Turns out team building
with them

06:25.791 --> 06:28.375
was much harder than I thought.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.208
Happy to be teaming up,
partner!

06:30.208 --> 06:31.333
Hug it out, bubba.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.500
Talk about a frosty reception.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.708
Ooh, personal bubble.

06:34.708 --> 06:36.916
Understand.

06:36.916 --> 06:38.791
I tried working with them...

06:38.791 --> 06:40.416
...but the Shadow Clan
have their own ideas

06:40.416 --> 06:42.791
about keeping the caverns safe.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.583
I tried to warn them
they were upsetting folks.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.541
But they're all about
protecting the slugs,

06:48.541 --> 06:49.666
even over people.

06:49.666 --> 06:50.958
Oh floppers.

06:50.958 --> 06:52.375
( chirping )

06:52.375 --> 06:53.916
They keep gathering up
slugs and bringing them here.

06:53.916 --> 06:55.500
No one knows why.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.083
It's creepy!

06:57.083 --> 06:59.541
Guys, this much slug energy
in one place

06:59.541 --> 07:02.375
could cause imbalances
in the 99.

07:02.375 --> 07:04.291
Watch your step everybody.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.208
Yes, we do not want
any...WAHH!

07:07.208 --> 07:09.541
( screeching )

07:10.791 --> 07:12.666
( chokes )

07:12.666 --> 07:13.375
PLEH!

07:13.375 --> 07:14.250
Augh!

07:15.333 --> 07:16.458
( angry chirping )

07:16.458 --> 07:17.958
Ehh, sorry!

07:17.958 --> 07:19.000
Huh?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
( chirps )

07:20.000 --> 07:21.500
Oh!

07:21.500 --> 07:23.791
( chirp )

07:23.791 --> 07:24.708
Oh, ohhh!

07:24.708 --> 07:27.250
Ahaha!

07:27.250 --> 07:29.333
Ooookay.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.208
I guess we should do...

07:31.208 --> 07:33.833
something about this?

07:33.833 --> 07:35.250
Uhh.

07:35.250 --> 07:39.291
( laughs )

07:39.291 --> 07:40.958
C'mon guys!

07:40.958 --> 07:43.333
Slug-slug-slug!

07:43.333 --> 07:44.291
This way!

07:44.291 --> 07:45.458
Too many of them!

07:45.458 --> 07:48.000
Yeah slugs, yeah. Go.

07:49.083 --> 07:50.541
Huh?

07:54.208 --> 07:54.791
( chirps )

07:54.791 --> 07:56.125
Huh?

07:59.208 --> 08:02.375
Welcome home, Eli Shane.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.250
Oh, no way man!

08:03.250 --> 08:04.458
( nervous laugh )

08:04.458 --> 08:06.750
( chirps )

08:06.750 --> 08:11.583
Have you ever experienced
so much slug energy?

08:11.583 --> 08:13.791
No, I can't say I have.

08:13.791 --> 08:17.875
But I'm concerned that this
many slugs is bad for the town!

08:17.875 --> 08:19.625
It could cause
energy imbalances,

08:19.625 --> 08:22.041
making it difficult for
the people who live here.

08:22.041 --> 08:25.250
Slugs are needed here
near the Great Abyss.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.458
Humans are not.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.416
We have worked together before

08:29.416 --> 08:31.041
and you know I'm aware
of how important

08:31.041 --> 08:32.832
the slugs are to Slugterra.

08:32.832 --> 08:36.125
But either you stop this...

08:36.125 --> 08:39.000
or I will.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.750
We once told you we had
the same goal

08:41.750 --> 08:43.875
as The Son of Shane.

08:43.875 --> 08:48.500
And now it appears...
we were mistaken.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.666
What?!

08:49.666 --> 08:53.333
Those who place themselves
above the slugs,

08:53.333 --> 08:56.625
invite disaster.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.000
Wait!

09:02.583 --> 09:05.333
Sooooo, how'd it go?

09:05.333 --> 09:07.375
Not good.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.500
Looks like we're going to have
to handle this ourselves.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.416
( distant singing)

09:11.416 --> 09:12.875
That sound...

09:12.875 --> 09:14.375
...where is it coming from?

09:14.375 --> 09:15.875
( gasp )

09:18.791 --> 09:20.125
Huh?

09:20.125 --> 09:23.208
( singing )

09:23.208 --> 09:25.708
Take them somewhere safe, girl.

09:35.541 --> 09:38.583
( chirping )

09:38.583 --> 09:39.458
Woahh!

09:39.458 --> 09:46.041
( chirping )

09:48.291 --> 09:51.125
That was amazing!

09:53.500 --> 09:54.541
( chirps )

09:54.541 --> 09:56.291
What kind of slug is that?

09:56.291 --> 09:57.375
( sniffs )

09:57.375 --> 10:00.375
Just who do you
think you are?

10:00.375 --> 10:01.875
I'm Tad.

10:01.875 --> 10:04.750
And uh...I don't really know
what kind of a slug she is.

10:04.750 --> 10:05.875
Ugh!

10:05.875 --> 10:07.125
I'm Eli.

10:07.125 --> 10:11.250
This is Trixie, Kord and
the charmer is Pronto.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.083
Heh.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.541
Nice to meet you.

10:13.541 --> 10:16.041
Pfffft!

10:16.041 --> 10:18.333
Are you the sheriff
or something?

10:18.333 --> 10:19.500
Something.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.458
He's the Shane!

10:21.458 --> 10:22.958
Thanks, we owe you.

10:22.958 --> 10:24.666
You just saved us days
of work.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.708
I was just trying to help.

10:26.708 --> 10:28.250
Ah yes, yes, good good good.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.916
Now if you'll excuse us,
we're very busy.

10:30.916 --> 10:32.125
Lots to do.

10:32.125 --> 10:34.916
Hero stuff, you - you wouldn't
understand.

10:34.916 --> 10:37.583
So, uh, what cavern
do you come from?

10:37.583 --> 10:38.791
Ah, yes.

10:38.791 --> 10:40.125
Um.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.541
I'm from, uh...

10:41.541 --> 10:42.416
( chuckles )

10:42.416 --> 10:44.750
...not from around here.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.750
Maybe from somewhere...

10:46.750 --> 10:48.833
...surface-y?

10:48.833 --> 10:51.166
Oh, um...I, uh.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.583
Heh.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.750
Not a lot of clothes like
yours around these parts.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.416
You know about the surface?

10:57.416 --> 10:59.416
I'm kinda from there too.

10:59.416 --> 11:01.000
I've only been down here
a few days.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.125
( sniffs )

11:02.125 --> 11:03.625
Best not to talk
about the surface.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.750
Most people will think
you're crazy.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.250
I think I am crazy.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.291
I mean there's this whole
other world beneath our feet!

11:10.291 --> 11:14.958
Well just between us...
I know, right?!

11:14.958 --> 11:17.250
How did you find
your way here?

11:17.250 --> 11:18.625
It was me!

11:18.625 --> 11:20.166
I did it all myself, y'hear?

11:20.166 --> 11:22.500
( cheer )

11:22.500 --> 11:26.083
Ah, this probably isn't the best
place for this conversation.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.375
Where are you headed, Tad?

11:28.375 --> 11:29.958
I have no idea.

11:29.958 --> 11:32.208
Which way are you going?

11:34.458 --> 11:35.416
When I was little...

11:35.416 --> 11:37.541
...I rescued Piper from a cat.

11:37.541 --> 11:40.000
I nursed her back to health,
and then...

11:40.000 --> 11:42.291
I started wondering where
she came from.

11:42.291 --> 11:43.666
( yawns )

11:43.666 --> 11:46.250
What was it like for you
on the surface Eli?

11:46.250 --> 11:49.791
Ah, for a long time it was
pretty good.

11:49.791 --> 11:53.500
And then...not that great.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.041
When I was ten my mother
had to leave

11:55.041 --> 11:59.208
and I went to live
with my uncle.

11:59.208 --> 12:02.833
I haven't seen or heard
from her since.

12:02.833 --> 12:04.125
( sad chirp )

12:04.125 --> 12:05.375
Wow.

12:05.375 --> 12:08.666
Eli never talks about
the surface.

12:08.666 --> 12:12.458
Well, for me it
was mostly bad.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.708
I have no need to go
back up there.

12:14.708 --> 12:17.791
How exactly did you get
down here?

12:17.791 --> 12:20.500
Pieper helped me map all
sorts of underground tunnels...

12:20.500 --> 12:21.833
...for years I mapped them

12:21.833 --> 12:24.291
and eventually we found
our way here.

12:24.291 --> 12:27.000
Ooooh-hoo-hoo!...

12:27.000 --> 12:28.416
How does it work?

12:28.416 --> 12:30.375
Well, it doesn't really work
anymore,

12:30.375 --> 12:32.000
not way down here.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.458
You can have it
if you want it.

12:33.458 --> 12:34.916
Oooh-hoo-hoo!

12:34.916 --> 12:36.791
( gasps )

12:36.791 --> 12:39.000
Pieper's the only slug
I've ever known.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.750
But you all have so many.

12:40.750 --> 12:41.750
Pffft.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.583
It's this world
that's impressive.

12:43.583 --> 12:46.666
I'd love to know as much
about slugs as you do.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.000
Then I'll have to
teach you.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.083
You mean it? Really?

12:50.083 --> 12:52.625
Sure. We can start first
thing tomorrow.

12:52.625 --> 12:55.250
Wow. Thanks!

12:56.833 --> 12:59.083
Surface-brothers.

13:02.541 --> 13:05.750
Slug energy has an affect
on everything in Slugterra

13:05.750 --> 13:08.958
and is essential to the health
of the 99 caverns.

13:08.958 --> 13:11.041
There is a "fragile balance"
in Slugterra

13:11.041 --> 13:13.875
that must be maintained.

13:13.875 --> 13:16.458
And too many slugs can be
a bad thing?

13:16.458 --> 13:18.375
Well, no not really.

13:18.375 --> 13:22.250
More like too much of
a good thing.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.166
Okay, here's how you meet
a slug.

13:24.166 --> 13:27.541
Is there anyone down there,
up for some fun?

13:27.541 --> 13:29.083
( chirps )

13:29.083 --> 13:31.458
Wanna ride with
the Shane Gang?

13:31.458 --> 13:33.083
( chirps )

13:34.125 --> 13:34.916
( chuckles )

13:34.916 --> 13:36.000
Guess he does.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.458
Never forget,
they're not just ammo,

13:38.458 --> 13:39.791
they're your friends.

13:39.791 --> 13:43.000
And if you're really good,
they'll be your family.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.291
Hi there, buddy.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.083
Want to help me show my friend
what a Tazerling does?

13:47.125 --> 13:48.625
( chirps )

13:56.791 --> 13:58.291
Wow!

13:58.291 --> 13:59.708
Can I try?

13:59.708 --> 14:01.208
Give it a shot.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.625
Uhh, is there anyone down there,
up for some fun?

14:06.625 --> 14:09.083
( chirps )

14:09.083 --> 14:10.375
Don't chase it.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.250
Let it come to you.

14:13.791 --> 14:15.333
Hey! I'm Tad!

14:15.333 --> 14:20.166
I like popcorn, scary movies
and rainy days?

14:20.166 --> 14:21.458
( chuckles )

14:21.458 --> 14:23.458
( laughs )

14:23.458 --> 14:24.416
( chirps )

14:24.416 --> 14:25.291
Oh!

14:25.291 --> 14:26.583
( chirps )

14:26.583 --> 14:27.916
I got one!

14:27.916 --> 14:31.250
Wow! That was...really good.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.458
What kind is this?

14:32.458 --> 14:33.666
A Hop Rock.

14:33.666 --> 14:36.875
The slug version of
a firecracker.

14:36.875 --> 14:37.833
What was that?

14:37.833 --> 14:39.208
Trouble!

14:42.916 --> 14:43.541
Please!

14:43.541 --> 14:45.083
You can't do this!

14:45.083 --> 14:46.333
Uh uh uh!

14:46.333 --> 14:49.250
You 'aught-never told us
what to do, mister.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.291
Yeah.

14:50.291 --> 14:53.583
We don't likes knowing
what to do!

14:56.250 --> 14:57.625
These two aren't
the brightest,

14:57.625 --> 14:59.125
but they can still be dangerous.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.791
We've gotta stop 'em.

15:00.791 --> 15:02.500
Yeah. We do.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.125
( chirps )

15:05.125 --> 15:06.666
( excited chirping )

15:08.625 --> 15:10.583
Please! You can't do this!

15:10.583 --> 15:12.125
Now sir.

15:12.125 --> 15:15.125
Me and My brother was raised
to believe we can do anything

15:15.125 --> 15:18.041
we put our minds to.

15:18.041 --> 15:22.666
Every accomplishment starts
with the decision to try!

15:22.666 --> 15:24.250
Augh!

15:24.250 --> 15:27.625
But the gold is for the Building
Society to build an orphanage!

15:27.625 --> 15:29.041
Oh ho ho!

15:29.041 --> 15:32.416
I believe you mean it was
for building an orphanage.

15:32.416 --> 15:35.375
Besides, we grew up
without an orphanage!

15:35.375 --> 15:38.916
Yeah, alls we had
was parents!

15:38.916 --> 15:41.875
( laugh )

15:41.875 --> 15:43.791
And we turned out just fine.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.875
( laugh )

16:05.125 --> 16:07.375
Hey! It's some kid!

16:13.708 --> 16:15.166
Oh no!

16:18.666 --> 16:19.625
Hah!

16:19.625 --> 16:21.250
Ugh!

16:24.250 --> 16:25.250
( chirps )

16:34.458 --> 16:35.625
Uh-oh!

16:38.333 --> 16:39.708
( chirp )

16:50.458 --> 16:52.708
Hang on, Eli!

16:52.708 --> 16:54.541
( chirping )

16:58.583 --> 16:59.541
( determined chirp )

17:01.750 --> 17:02.791
Hiyah! Come on!

17:02.791 --> 17:04.208
Yeah!

17:07.165 --> 17:10.375
( straining )

17:10.375 --> 17:12.333
( laughs )

17:12.333 --> 17:15.540
This is one of the easiest
scores we ever had!

17:15.540 --> 17:17.958
We oughtta rob orphans
more often!

17:17.958 --> 17:21.875
Yeah, the trick is finding
the ones with the money!

17:21.875 --> 17:22.915
( chuckles )

17:25.790 --> 17:27.250
All right, Tad!

17:31.708 --> 17:32.791
Woah!

17:36.125 --> 17:37.666
Agh!

17:37.666 --> 17:38.666
WAHHHH!

17:38.666 --> 17:41.708
( straining )

17:41.708 --> 17:45.041
Augh!

17:45.041 --> 17:46.083
Whoah!

17:50.541 --> 17:51.666
( panting )

18:00.000 --> 18:02.083
It's that kid again!

18:02.083 --> 18:04.666
What's he care
about orphans for?

18:16.791 --> 18:17.833
( gasp )

18:23.416 --> 18:24.833
( gasp )

18:24.833 --> 18:26.791
Don't chase it.

18:26.791 --> 18:28.750
Let it come to you...

18:31.125 --> 18:32.208
HIYAH!

18:36.208 --> 18:36.958
Haha!

18:36.958 --> 18:37.958
Woo-hoo!

18:41.875 --> 18:44.583
( straining )

18:46.416 --> 18:47.791
Ha-ha!

18:47.791 --> 18:49.000
He's runnin!

18:49.000 --> 18:49.916
Heh heh!

18:49.916 --> 18:51.333
What an amateur!

18:55.500 --> 18:56.291
( gasps )

18:56.291 --> 18:57.250
Oh boy...

19:04.500 --> 19:06.833
( laughing )

19:06.833 --> 19:09.166
WHOOOOOOO!!!

19:09.166 --> 19:10.041
Woah!

19:14.958 --> 19:17.291
( straining )

19:17.291 --> 19:18.750
Woohoooo!

19:18.750 --> 19:19.750
Augh!

19:20.791 --> 19:24.583
( grunts )

19:24.583 --> 19:25.750
( startled grunts )

19:29.250 --> 19:31.333
AHHHH!!!

19:36.916 --> 19:38.958
I hope you know
what you're doing, Tad.

19:38.958 --> 19:40.958
I hope you know what
you're doing, Pieper.

19:50.083 --> 19:51.166
Ugh!

19:51.166 --> 19:53.833
AHHHH!!!

19:53.833 --> 19:55.041
C'mon, Tad!

19:58.041 --> 20:01.083
All right, Burpy,
if you say so!

20:01.083 --> 20:04.083
AHHHH!!!

20:17.916 --> 20:19.125
GAH!

20:20.125 --> 20:20.958
Ugh!

20:20.958 --> 20:23.666
( pants )

20:24.416 --> 20:25.708
Good work.

20:25.708 --> 20:28.166
You definitely have a knack
for slug-slinging.

20:29.666 --> 20:30.875
( chirps )

20:32.875 --> 20:33.791
Thank you.

20:33.791 --> 20:35.250
Thank you both!

20:35.250 --> 20:37.583
I don't know what those poor
children would have done!

20:37.583 --> 20:38.458
It was our -

20:38.458 --> 20:40.875
Hello!?

20:42.750 --> 20:46.083
( panicked grunts )

20:46.083 --> 20:47.291
C'mon!

20:47.291 --> 20:50.666
We're hanging on by
our fingernails here!

20:50.666 --> 20:51.291
AH!

20:51.291 --> 20:53.291
We'll do anything!

20:53.291 --> 20:55.208
Anything, hmm?

20:56.958 --> 21:04.000
( grunt and strain )

21:04.000 --> 21:06.166
( laugh )

21:08.166 --> 21:10.625
Shouldn't they be back
by now?

21:10.625 --> 21:12.125
Hmm, perhaps not.

21:12.125 --> 21:15.166
That Tad needs a lot
of schooling.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.708
Wait. I'm getting something
about a slugfight

21:18.708 --> 21:21.041
in Splinterback Cavern

21:21.041 --> 21:22.833
- reports are just
coming in.

21:22.833 --> 21:25.875
Or we can just tell you
about it.

21:25.875 --> 21:26.875
Brooo!

21:26.875 --> 21:29.708
You got Tazerling
and a Hop Rock?

21:29.708 --> 21:33.000
Did Locke and Lode try to rob
the Building Society again?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.333
Yeahhh. I have no idea why
Locke and Lode

21:35.333 --> 21:37.750
are always picking
on the orphans.

21:37.750 --> 21:38.958
No kidding!

21:38.958 --> 21:40.791
I have something to say.

21:40.791 --> 21:44.583
I know we normally discuss
this sort of thing beforehand.

21:44.583 --> 21:48.500
But after what I saw today,

21:48.500 --> 21:50.541
I'm convinced.

21:56.083 --> 21:57.083
Wow.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.291
Hey!

21:58.291 --> 22:00.875
How come no one ever gave Pronto
a bandolier?

22:00.875 --> 22:02.000
Aww,

22:02.000 --> 22:03.416
( chuckles )
Pronto.

22:03.416 --> 22:08.041
Tad. Welcome to The Shane Gang.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.208
I-I-I don't know what
to say...

22:10.208 --> 22:12.791
Say yes.

22:18.750 --> 22:21.166
Welcome to the team, bro!

22:21.166 --> 22:22.791
Pfffft, whatever.

22:22.791 --> 22:25.166
( laughs )

22:29.666 --> 22:36.750
( snores softly )

22:36.750 --> 22:38.791
Mmmhmmmm...

22:38.791 --> 22:39.916
TEN HUT!

22:39.916 --> 22:40.750
AHH!

22:40.750 --> 22:41.458
( screech )

22:41.458 --> 22:43.000
Rise and shine newbie!

22:43.000 --> 22:48.500
It is time for the first step
in becoming my "Pronto-gé".

22:48.500 --> 22:49.875
Ugh, huh?

22:49.875 --> 22:50.833
What?

22:50.833 --> 22:52.458
My Pronto-gé!

22:52.458 --> 22:55.166
I'm going to teach you
everything I know,

22:55.166 --> 22:59.250
so someday, when you ride
triumphantly into battle,

22:59.250 --> 23:03.791
everyone will stop,
gaze upon you, and say,

23:03.791 --> 23:07.666
"well, he's no Pronto,
but he'll do".

23:07.666 --> 23:10.166
( chokes and coughs )

23:10.166 --> 23:11.041
Augh!

23:11.041 --> 23:13.833
Heh, my Flatulorhinkus, Stinky,

23:13.833 --> 23:17.083
must have been playing
in my boots again.

23:17.083 --> 23:17.875
Nuh uh.

23:17.875 --> 23:19.208
( groans )

23:19.208 --> 23:21.375
Morning guys, it's time to -

23:21.375 --> 23:22.208
Whoa!

23:22.208 --> 23:23.583
( coughs )

23:23.583 --> 23:25.416
What crawled in here
and died?

23:25.416 --> 23:26.833
I know that stench!

23:26.833 --> 23:29.875
Pronto unleashed the boot
beasts again.

23:29.875 --> 23:30.583
Woah!

23:30.583 --> 23:31.958
( coughs )

23:31.958 --> 23:34.291
Pronto, what are
you doing?!

23:34.291 --> 23:36.083
I am teaching young Tad

23:36.083 --> 23:39.958
how to become a great
warrior like Pronto!

23:39.958 --> 23:43.750
Ugh, and you started
with gas warfare?

23:43.750 --> 23:46.333
( chuckles )

23:46.333 --> 23:49.000
Hey Tad, you up
for a little target practice?

23:49.000 --> 23:50.166
Outside?

23:50.166 --> 23:52.000
Don't have to ask me twice.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.875
C'mon guys,
let's get out of here.

23:54.875 --> 23:57.291
Hey! Wait!

23:57.291 --> 23:59.958
What about my boots?!

24:01.416 --> 24:02.791
After your performance
yesterday,

24:02.791 --> 24:05.666
I know you got some serious
slug-slinging skills.

24:05.666 --> 24:06.541
Thanks.

24:06.541 --> 24:08.375
But all I did was aim and fire.

24:08.375 --> 24:09.666
The slugs did all the work.

24:09.666 --> 24:10.458
( laughs )

24:10.458 --> 24:11.791
True.

24:11.791 --> 24:13.541
But following the Code and
bonding with your slugs

24:13.541 --> 24:16.458
is what makes a good slinger
great!

24:16.458 --> 24:20.208
( dazed chirping )

24:20.208 --> 24:21.458
( chuckles )

24:21.458 --> 24:23.083
Hey, Pieper - knock it off!

24:23.083 --> 24:25.458
( chirp )

24:25.458 --> 24:27.000
( grunts )

24:27.000 --> 24:30.458
Sorry, she's not used
to being around other slugs.

24:30.458 --> 24:33.291
Well, you're both part of
the Shane Gang now.

24:33.291 --> 24:34.458
Right guys?

24:34.458 --> 24:35.291
Mmhmm!

24:35.291 --> 24:38.416
( laugh )

24:38.416 --> 24:40.416
Okay, let's get started.

24:40.416 --> 24:41.333
Trixie?

24:41.333 --> 24:43.416
Ready when you are,
Eli!

24:43.416 --> 24:45.083
All right, Burpy.

24:47.291 --> 24:48.416
PULL!

24:59.916 --> 25:02.458
Woah, cool!

25:05.583 --> 25:06.500
( chirps )

25:06.500 --> 25:08.750
Wow, what was that!

25:08.750 --> 25:10.791
It's called Slug Fu.

25:10.791 --> 25:13.041
Something I learned
in the Eastern Caverns.

25:13.041 --> 25:14.750
Can you teach me
to do that?

25:14.750 --> 25:17.541
Slow down, let's stick
to basics for now.

25:17.541 --> 25:20.250
Try knocking that can off
the post.

25:24.291 --> 25:25.208
( chuckles )

25:25.208 --> 25:26.875
( chirps )

25:26.875 --> 25:27.875
Huh?

25:27.875 --> 25:29.375
( worried chirp )

25:29.375 --> 25:31.125
( screeches )

25:31.125 --> 25:32.166
Oh boy...

25:32.166 --> 25:33.333
HAHA!

25:33.333 --> 25:35.041
Sling and a miss!

25:35.041 --> 25:36.500
Hehehe!

25:36.500 --> 25:38.625
...okay I'm done.

25:38.625 --> 25:40.083
You okay, Sparcx?

25:40.083 --> 25:41.208
Uh huh!

25:41.208 --> 25:43.375
Hmm. Needs work...

25:43.375 --> 25:44.916
But you've got it right,

25:44.916 --> 25:47.625
giving your slugs names is the
best way to bond with them.

25:47.625 --> 25:50.166
Around here, we're just one
big, happy family --

25:50.166 --> 25:51.458
( giggle and chirp )

25:51.458 --> 25:53.750
Come back here
with my boots!

25:53.750 --> 25:56.041
Every family's got a Pronto.

25:56.041 --> 25:58.125
Look Eli, I know I can
do better.

25:58.125 --> 25:59.708
Let me try again with Pieper.

25:59.708 --> 26:01.833
But not with that dinky
slingshot.

26:01.833 --> 26:04.958
Tad needs a decent blaster,
with an accelerator.

26:04.958 --> 26:06.666
( grunt )

26:06.666 --> 26:10.250
Let's see what you can do
with a real slingin' iron.

26:10.250 --> 26:12.250
Woah!

26:12.250 --> 26:13.833
My old blaster.

26:13.833 --> 26:14.958
Seriously?

26:14.958 --> 26:16.416
And I can use it?

26:16.416 --> 26:17.625
You can have it.

26:17.625 --> 26:19.125
Surface Brothers, right?

26:19.125 --> 26:21.958
Heh, I don't know
what to say.

26:21.958 --> 26:23.166
Don't say anything.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.291
Just show us
what you can do.

26:29.916 --> 26:32.291
( deep breath
then exhales )

26:37.750 --> 26:39.583
Hey, don't sweat it...

26:46.916 --> 26:49.250
Just when I was about
to write the kid off,

26:49.250 --> 26:51.791
he pulls off a sweet shot
like that.

26:51.791 --> 26:55.125
Yeah, looks like we might have
another slug slingin' savant

26:55.125 --> 26:57.625
from the surface,
just like Eli.

26:57.625 --> 26:58.625
( chirps )

26:58.625 --> 27:01.166
Alright, let's step it up
a notch.

28:10.041 --> 28:12.541
( fart )

28:44.625 --> 28:47.250
Now that's what I call
a good day of training.

28:47.250 --> 28:50.250
Not to brag, but you kinda
remind me of me,

28:50.250 --> 28:51.958
when I first started.

28:51.958 --> 28:53.875
Bro, that was a total brag.

28:53.875 --> 28:55.666
But you're right:

28:55.666 --> 28:58.041
You and the kid here
are definitely surface brothers

28:58.041 --> 29:00.708
from another mother.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.583
Whoa, cool mecha?

29:02.583 --> 29:03.750
It's yours!

29:03.750 --> 29:05.875
Go on, give it a test ride.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.208
( laughs )

29:07.208 --> 29:09.250
This is all like a dream -

29:09.250 --> 29:11.625
I've never felt like I belonged
anywhere before

29:11.625 --> 29:13.666
and now I'm finally down
in Slugterra,

29:13.666 --> 29:15.416
slug-slinging with
the Shane Gang!

29:15.416 --> 29:16.958
( chuckles )

29:16.958 --> 29:18.416
If he's going to be
in the Shane Gang,

29:18.416 --> 29:20.416
he'll need a bit more experience
in the field.

29:20.416 --> 29:23.750
Well luckily experience is
something we're never short of

29:23.750 --> 29:25.291
in the 99 Caverns.

29:25.291 --> 29:26.708
Take a look at this.

29:26.708 --> 29:29.291
Slugs, slugs, slugs!

29:29.291 --> 29:32.208
Don't you weep,
we got 'em cheap!

29:32.208 --> 29:35.125
Come to the giant discount
Slug-a-Palooza

29:35.125 --> 29:37.291
in Antimony Cavern.

29:37.291 --> 29:41.708
We will Slugggg Youuuuuu
Sillyyyyyyyy!

29:41.708 --> 29:44.208
Discount Slug-a-Palooza?

29:44.208 --> 29:45.750
Sounds kinda fishy.

29:45.750 --> 29:48.000
Yeah, and those slugs
didn't exactly look thrilled

29:48.000 --> 29:49.958
to be part of the deal.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.791
I say we go check it out.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.250
Good idea.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.291
A low key mission like this
is exactly what Tad needs

29:55.291 --> 29:57.208
to get warmed up.

29:58.708 --> 30:01.833
Hey, kid - you up
for a little road trip?

30:01.833 --> 30:03.416
Oh, yeah!

30:09.291 --> 30:10.875
( laugh )

30:10.875 --> 30:11.833
Ha ha ha!

30:11.833 --> 30:13.375
So, newbie -

30:13.375 --> 30:17.250
I can see that my training
has paid off so far.

30:17.250 --> 30:21.000
Uh, hehe, yeah, sure!

30:21.000 --> 30:23.750
Oh yeah, Pronto,
you've been a great teacher.

30:23.750 --> 30:24.750
What's next?

30:24.750 --> 30:28.041
Ahh, my specialty -
tracking!

30:28.041 --> 30:31.500
This cavern we seek is in
unfamiliar territory.

30:31.500 --> 30:35.500
Therefore I, Pronto,
will use my superior skills

30:35.500 --> 30:38.125
to find our destination.

30:38.125 --> 30:40.916
And what skills are those,
you might ask?

30:40.916 --> 30:42.500
Nobody asked.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.208
They are, in this order - -

30:45.208 --> 30:47.666
an intuitive sense of direction,

30:47.666 --> 30:52.208
a laser-like focus and,
most importantly of all,

30:52.208 --> 30:54.250
keen eyesight -

30:55.958 --> 30:57.041
AHHHHH!

30:57.041 --> 30:59.083
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMIIIING!

30:59.083 --> 31:00.416
Hang on, Pronto!

31:00.416 --> 31:02.375
AHHHHH!

31:02.375 --> 31:03.291
Eh-?

31:03.291 --> 31:04.416
Uh oh.

31:04.416 --> 31:06.333
Agh!

31:06.333 --> 31:07.000
( gasps )

31:07.000 --> 31:08.375
Don't worry, buddy.

31:08.375 --> 31:09.875
I got you.

31:09.875 --> 31:12.333
( gasps )

31:12.333 --> 31:14.208
Thank you!

31:16.000 --> 31:19.791
Ahh... I see Antimony cavern!

31:19.791 --> 31:25.125
Once again, Pronto's superior
tracking skills have prevailed!

31:25.125 --> 31:28.041
Okay, let's see what
this is all about --

31:28.041 --> 31:31.500
slugs and money
never mix.

31:35.666 --> 31:36.750
( whimper )

31:36.750 --> 31:37.833
These poor slugs.

31:37.833 --> 31:40.708
I don't like the looks of this,
one bit.

31:40.708 --> 31:41.750
( whimper )

31:41.750 --> 31:43.750
( chuckles )

31:48.750 --> 31:51.166
Wah!

31:51.166 --> 31:52.583
( sad chirp )

31:52.583 --> 31:54.333
These poor slugs.

31:54.333 --> 31:55.958
Can you believe this?

31:55.958 --> 31:57.250
If you ask me,

31:57.250 --> 31:59.625
it looks like an accident
waiting to happen.

32:03.625 --> 32:05.375
( whimper )

32:05.375 --> 32:07.250
This place is a mess.

32:07.250 --> 32:10.166
Who could be responsible
for a circus like this?

32:10.166 --> 32:11.750
Circus?

32:11.750 --> 32:15.000
This is a business,
not a circus.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.958
Circuses make me
wanna puke!

32:18.958 --> 32:19.833
Well, well.

32:19.833 --> 32:23.083
If it isn't the "Scrap Force".

32:23.083 --> 32:25.583
It isn't the Scrap Force!

32:25.583 --> 32:28.250
The scrap yard is
for amateurs.

32:28.250 --> 32:32.958
We have our sights set
for bigger and better things.

32:32.958 --> 32:36.375
Henceforth, we shall be
known as...

32:36.375 --> 32:38.958
The Tough Guys!

32:41.041 --> 32:42.041
Ugh...

32:42.041 --> 32:43.291
( laughs )

32:43.291 --> 32:43.958
Uh...

32:43.958 --> 32:44.666
uh...

32:44.666 --> 32:45.541
uh...

32:45.541 --> 32:46.916
Uhh, The Tough Guys! Brilliant!

32:46.916 --> 32:48.000
Nice going, boss!

32:48.000 --> 32:50.708
Wait... that was my name.

32:50.708 --> 32:53.041
I don't care what you call
yourselves, Ember.

32:53.041 --> 32:55.375
But I do care about these slugs
you're mistreating.

32:55.375 --> 32:57.791
You need to shut this down,
now!

32:57.791 --> 32:59.416
( laughs )

32:59.416 --> 33:02.041
I take orders from no man-

33:02.041 --> 33:05.291
And especially no Shane!

33:05.291 --> 33:07.250
Do I look like I need
your help?

33:07.250 --> 33:08.541
Sorry, boss.

33:08.541 --> 33:11.958
-and especially no Shane!

33:11.958 --> 33:13.125
Huh?

33:13.125 --> 33:15.875
I am a businessman,
pure and simple.

33:15.875 --> 33:16.500
( chuckles )

33:16.500 --> 33:17.875
I'll get rich -

33:17.875 --> 33:22.000
and nobody's going to stand
in my way while I do it!

33:22.000 --> 33:23.708
Don't even think about it,
Ember.

33:23.708 --> 33:25.416
There's innocent people around.

33:25.416 --> 33:28.166
Oh, boo-hoo.

33:28.166 --> 33:32.375
Your goody-goody attitude
makes me want to puke!

33:32.375 --> 33:35.041
You know, he has that
'puke' thing.

33:35.041 --> 33:36.541
Maybe we should, like,
ugh...

33:36.541 --> 33:39.500
hiccup or get twitchy eyes
or something.

33:39.500 --> 33:43.000
Guah... that's the dumbest thing
I ever heard.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.541
Discount slugs
are the future!

33:45.541 --> 33:49.208
I mean it, Ember -
shut it down, now!

33:49.208 --> 33:52.250
I'll do nothing
of the sort.

33:52.250 --> 33:54.625
( hiss )

33:54.625 --> 33:56.291
Oh man...

33:57.625 --> 33:58.958
Egh, don't look now,

33:58.958 --> 34:01.416
but we got some party crashers
in the house.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.833
( hiss )

34:04.833 --> 34:06.041
( yelps )

34:06.041 --> 34:07.958
Ugh, I don't like the looks
of this, boss.

34:07.958 --> 34:08.916
What do we do?

34:08.916 --> 34:12.333
Stand firm!

34:12.333 --> 34:14.541
Where'd those creepy things
come from?

34:14.541 --> 34:17.791
The Shadow Clan has a way of
popping in unexpected.

34:17.791 --> 34:20.166
Question is,
what do they want?

34:20.166 --> 34:23.416
I'd better find out
before this gets ugly.

34:23.416 --> 34:26.791
So, uh, nice night, huh?

34:26.791 --> 34:30.708
Son of the Shane,
leave this place.

34:30.708 --> 34:32.833
You know our purpose.

34:32.833 --> 34:36.541
We will do what we must
to protect the slugs.

34:36.541 --> 34:37.833
And I must do what I must

34:37.833 --> 34:40.541
to protect all the inhabitants
of Slugterra.

34:40.541 --> 34:42.416
Let me negotiate
with Boss Ember.

34:42.416 --> 34:44.125
I can end this peacefully.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.250
No, Eli Shane.

34:46.250 --> 34:50.750
Let me say it so all
shall comprehend.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.166
What's the big one saying?

34:52.166 --> 34:53.375
Who knows?

34:53.375 --> 34:56.208
The Shadow language
is incomprehensible.

34:56.208 --> 35:01.208
Those who harm slugs,
will PERISH!

35:01.208 --> 35:02.041
( gasps )

35:02.041 --> 35:02.916
( whimpers )

35:02.916 --> 35:05.083
( screams )

35:06.666 --> 35:08.125
I sure understood that.

35:08.125 --> 35:11.208
Wait... you just
spoke our language?

35:11.208 --> 35:14.541
We speak for the slugs!

35:16.875 --> 35:18.083
( screams )

35:19.833 --> 35:21.791
Return fire!

35:23.083 --> 35:23.916
( gasps )

35:23.916 --> 35:24.875
( shrieks )

35:30.333 --> 35:32.416
Trix, Kord, take the flanks!

35:32.416 --> 35:33.166
Right!

35:33.166 --> 35:34.333
On it!

35:38.458 --> 35:39.583
AHH!

35:44.916 --> 35:45.875
Uggghhh!

35:45.875 --> 35:46.791
( chirps )

35:46.791 --> 35:48.541
( scream )

35:58.375 --> 35:59.208
( chirps )

36:07.083 --> 36:08.458
This is getting out of hand.

36:12.875 --> 36:13.583
( grunts )

36:13.583 --> 36:14.875
Stop!

36:14.875 --> 36:18.083
Stand down, or perish!

36:18.083 --> 36:19.625
You can't do this!

36:19.625 --> 36:21.666
We protect the slugs.

36:21.666 --> 36:24.458
This matter is not your concern.

36:24.458 --> 36:25.791
Yes, it is.

36:25.791 --> 36:27.250
You know me -

36:27.250 --> 36:29.541
and you know I care about
the slugs as much as you do.

36:29.541 --> 36:32.208
But I also have innocent people
to worry about.

36:32.208 --> 36:33.375
Let me handle this.

36:33.375 --> 36:34.333
Please.

36:34.333 --> 36:35.791
For a friend.

36:35.791 --> 36:40.000
You are no friend,
Eli Shane.

36:43.083 --> 36:45.750
( laughs )

36:45.750 --> 36:46.583
( hisses )

36:49.666 --> 36:50.541
No!

36:53.333 --> 36:54.666
( screech )

36:54.666 --> 36:58.750
Okay, kid, make sure you stick
close to Pronto.

36:58.750 --> 36:59.458
Yeah, yeah.

36:59.458 --> 37:00.875
I got this, Pronto.

37:00.875 --> 37:02.250
Guah!

37:02.250 --> 37:03.750
My blaster!

37:08.791 --> 37:10.083
Ahh, Tad!

37:14.500 --> 37:17.458
Wuaaaahhhhhhh!

37:17.458 --> 37:18.916
I never saw that coming.

37:18.916 --> 37:20.250
Of course you didn't!

37:20.250 --> 37:22.250
Now, no more rookie mistakes!

37:22.250 --> 37:23.125
Hmm?

37:23.125 --> 37:24.791
( chirps )

37:24.791 --> 37:26.916
Thanks, Pieper.

37:26.916 --> 37:30.416
We need to work together,
like we used to.

37:30.416 --> 37:31.708
Trust me.

37:33.041 --> 37:35.625
Don't worry, I got this.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.666
Tad, no!

37:47.416 --> 37:48.125
Eli!

37:48.125 --> 37:49.250
Bro!

37:49.250 --> 37:50.708
Eli?

37:51.750 --> 37:52.750
( hisses )

37:52.750 --> 37:54.916
Oh man, I messed
up didn't I?

37:54.916 --> 37:56.166
I know you're trying to help,

37:56.166 --> 37:58.125
but Pronto has a duty
to tell you,

37:58.125 --> 38:00.541
with one hundred
percent certainty,

38:00.541 --> 38:03.583
YOU'RE NOT HELPING!

38:03.583 --> 38:06.125
It's okay kid,
we're not mad-

38:06.125 --> 38:08.375
-but we're afraid somebody
else will be!

38:08.375 --> 38:11.666
( hiss )

38:11.666 --> 38:12.416
Yeah!

38:12.416 --> 38:13.625
Woo-hoo-hoo!

38:13.625 --> 38:14.916
Yes!

38:14.916 --> 38:16.875
He-he, it makes me want
to hiccup!

38:16.875 --> 38:18.500
( laughs )

38:18.500 --> 38:19.875
Good one Mongo!

38:19.875 --> 38:20.666
What?!

38:20.666 --> 38:22.000
Oh, come on!

38:22.000 --> 38:24.083
Keep fighting!

38:25.625 --> 38:27.416
( chuckles )

38:29.166 --> 38:30.833
Watch out!

38:30.833 --> 38:33.083
Ugh.

38:33.083 --> 38:34.166
Betrayer!

38:34.166 --> 38:35.875
No, it's not like that...

38:35.875 --> 38:39.291
Step aside,
Eli Shane!

38:39.291 --> 38:40.375
Wuah!

38:40.375 --> 38:41.625
Guah, ugh!

38:43.875 --> 38:44.791
Ugh, ugh...

38:45.708 --> 38:47.041
Ngah, ugh.

38:47.041 --> 38:47.791
Guah!

38:47.791 --> 38:48.500
Ugh!

38:48.500 --> 38:49.500
Huh?

38:49.500 --> 38:50.333
Guah!

38:52.916 --> 38:53.625
Ugh!

38:53.625 --> 38:55.166
Guah!

38:55.166 --> 38:57.375
You know what, I think I've
had just about enough of this.

38:57.375 --> 38:58.625
Burpy, Joules!

38:58.625 --> 38:59.708
Come on, fellas,

39:02.333 --> 39:03.708
you know the drill!

39:11.791 --> 39:12.791
Ugh!

39:17.208 --> 39:18.166
Fall back!

39:18.166 --> 39:19.291
Retreat!

39:19.291 --> 39:20.916
What about the slugs?

39:20.916 --> 39:23.458
Leave them, we can find more.

39:23.458 --> 39:26.333
This is not over Shane!

39:26.333 --> 39:27.625
Come on guys!

39:27.625 --> 39:29.166
Stop, in the name of-

39:29.166 --> 39:31.875
( hiss )

39:31.875 --> 39:32.875
Don't shoot!

39:32.875 --> 39:34.416
We're not going to fight you!

39:34.416 --> 39:36.166
Guys, stand down.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.375
See? We mean no harm.

39:38.375 --> 39:40.500
The harm has come.

39:40.500 --> 39:43.125
Your intent is clear.

39:43.125 --> 39:44.500
Next time,

39:44.500 --> 39:48.833
you shall see the error
of your misjudgment.

39:48.833 --> 39:52.333
Wait, I can explain...

39:52.333 --> 39:54.750
Well, nice going.

39:54.750 --> 40:00.541
You just made the enemy
of our enemy, our enemy!

40:00.541 --> 40:02.250
We all make mistakes.

40:02.250 --> 40:04.916
So - no hard feelings?

40:04.916 --> 40:06.375
No hard feelings...

40:06.375 --> 40:09.708
except between us
and the Shadow Clan now.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.083
( sighs )

40:11.083 --> 40:12.625
You guys head back
to the hideout,

40:12.625 --> 40:15.291
I have to make things right
with the Shadow Clan...

40:15.291 --> 40:17.208
Wish me luck.

40:25.291 --> 40:26.208
Kord.

40:26.208 --> 40:27.625
Eli.

40:27.625 --> 40:30.208
I thought I asked you to
go back to the hideout?

40:30.208 --> 40:31.791
Yeah, sorry bro.

40:31.791 --> 40:35.166
No way I was gonna let you make
this trip all by your lonesome.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.125
Way too dangerous.

40:37.125 --> 40:38.500
What about the others?

40:38.500 --> 40:40.000
Headed back to the hideout.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.125
Hopefully, Trixie and Pronto
can keep Tad out of trouble

40:42.125 --> 40:43.708
until we get back.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.666
Hey, what's your gut-feeling?

40:45.666 --> 40:47.291
About Tad, I mean.

40:47.291 --> 40:48.375
Well, uh...

40:48.375 --> 40:49.708
He made a mistake today,

40:49.708 --> 40:53.041
but he's got that certain...
something.

40:53.041 --> 40:54.208
Huh.

40:54.208 --> 40:57.000
I'd say that's worth taking
a chance on.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.875
Yeah, me too.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.916
( hiss )

41:00.916 --> 41:01.958
Ewwwggghhh...

41:01.958 --> 41:04.291
This place gives me
major willies.

41:04.291 --> 41:06.416
How long until we find
the Shadow Clan?

41:06.416 --> 41:11.333
Well, you know the Shadow Clan,
they kinda find you.

41:11.333 --> 41:15.333
( hiss )

41:15.333 --> 41:18.291
Man, I hate when they do that!

41:18.291 --> 41:20.708
You are foolish to come here.

41:20.708 --> 41:22.041
I had to,

41:22.041 --> 41:24.416
I wanted to apologize
for what happened earlier.

41:24.416 --> 41:26.041
My friend Tad is new
around here.

41:26.041 --> 41:29.166
Your friend's mistake
matters little.

41:29.166 --> 41:31.791
When you left for
the Eastern Caverns,

41:31.791 --> 41:34.958
you abandoned the 99 Caverns.

41:34.958 --> 41:38.291
You forsook the precious slugs.

41:38.291 --> 41:40.458
I made sure the caverns
were protected,

41:40.458 --> 41:42.875
leaving them in your
temporary care.

41:42.875 --> 41:45.500
And now I'm back,
just as I'd promised.

41:45.500 --> 41:49.208
The 99 no longer have need
of a Shane.

41:49.208 --> 41:51.791
We will protect.

41:51.791 --> 41:54.375
Yeah, well, yelling "PERISH"
and shooting up the town

41:54.375 --> 41:57.000
isn't exactly the way to win
hearts and minds.

41:57.000 --> 42:05.916
Those who place themselves above
the slugs, invite disaster.

42:05.916 --> 42:09.958
Okay, I'm no diplomat, but
I don't think that went so well.

42:09.958 --> 42:11.333
It didn't.

42:11.333 --> 42:15.208
I gotta say, coming home
hasn't been what I expected.

42:15.208 --> 42:17.916
Especially after today's mess.

42:17.916 --> 42:20.125
Yeah -- here's hoping
that today's mess

42:20.125 --> 42:23.458
isn't a sign of an even
bigger mess to come.

42:25.583 --> 42:26.416
Yes...

42:26.416 --> 42:27.291
Yes...

42:27.291 --> 42:28.333
No!

42:28.333 --> 42:29.791
Dirt between the crevices.

42:29.791 --> 42:31.208
Uneven polish.

42:31.208 --> 42:32.708
Unacceptable!

42:32.708 --> 42:36.625
Pronto must be able to see
his handsome face in the shine!

42:36.625 --> 42:37.541
( chuckles )

42:37.541 --> 42:38.875
What's wrong, Pronto,

42:38.875 --> 42:41.291
Tad finally had enough of your
"mentoring"?

42:41.291 --> 42:42.125
Pfft!

42:42.125 --> 42:44.291
How can Pronto be the mentor

42:44.291 --> 42:46.541
of someone who isn't even
around to be...

42:46.541 --> 42:48.791
uh... mentee'd?

42:48.791 --> 42:51.458
Ah, I haven't seen him
since we got back.

42:51.458 --> 42:52.250
What do you mean?

42:52.250 --> 42:54.291
Hey, has anybody seen Tad?

42:54.291 --> 42:56.166
His mecha is missing!

42:56.166 --> 42:59.375
Okay, that's kinda weird.

42:59.375 --> 43:01.291
Eh, he probably just went out
for a night ride

43:01.291 --> 43:02.583
to clear his head.

43:02.583 --> 43:05.083
After a day like today,
I would too.

43:05.083 --> 43:08.833
Hmm, I hope it is something
that simple...

43:08.833 --> 43:10.875
...the Caverns can be
treacherous for someone

43:10.875 --> 43:14.625
as inexperienced as Tad.

43:14.625 --> 43:16.916
I'm sure he can
take care of himself.

43:16.916 --> 43:20.666
After all, how much trouble
could he possibly get into?

43:26.916 --> 43:32.000
( excited chirping )

43:32.000 --> 43:34.708
( giggles )

43:34.708 --> 43:35.625
Huh?

43:35.625 --> 43:37.166
Ugh!

43:37.166 --> 43:42.500
( synchronized grunting )

43:44.333 --> 43:45.250
Whu?

43:45.250 --> 43:46.791
Huh?

43:46.791 --> 43:52.291
( synchronized grunting )

43:52.291 --> 43:53.291
( giggling )

43:55.666 --> 44:04.500
( synchronized grunting )

44:06.000 --> 44:08.750
Gunderson flying
in for the shot...

44:08.750 --> 44:10.291
...and pow!

44:10.291 --> 44:11.541
A real good smack
from Krimlick!

44:11.541 --> 44:12.291
Nooooo!

44:12.291 --> 44:13.083
Yes!

44:13.083 --> 44:14.666
Still no word from Tad.

44:14.666 --> 44:15.416
( blows raspberry )

44:15.416 --> 44:17.083
Should we be worried?

44:17.083 --> 44:19.833
What if the shadow clan found
him after our fight.

44:19.833 --> 44:23.958
One must always worry when the
shadow clan is near.

44:23.958 --> 44:28.541
That is why Pronto avoids
every shadow he sees.

44:32.958 --> 44:33.750
Hey!

44:33.750 --> 44:34.916
Stop following me around.

44:34.916 --> 44:36.916
I know what you are up to!

44:36.916 --> 44:39.083
I don't think the Shadow Clan
is involved, Pronto.

44:39.083 --> 44:41.333
Tad's probably out practicing
his slug-slinging.

44:41.333 --> 44:44.625
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

44:44.625 --> 44:48.083
Slugs are disappearing all
across the 99 Caverns.

44:48.083 --> 44:49.375
Huh?

44:49.375 --> 44:50.833
Residents are reporting an
absence of slugs in

44:50.833 --> 44:53.708
Rocklock Cavern, Chillbore
Cavern, Dead Drop Cavern...

44:53.708 --> 44:55.291
Oh no.

44:55.291 --> 44:57.875
Even the famous Grenukes are
missing above Quiet Lawn Cavern.

44:57.875 --> 45:00.333
It's fantastic.

45:00.333 --> 45:02.708
We can make all the noise
we want now!

45:02.708 --> 45:03.833
Wooo!

45:05.625 --> 45:09.708
Well Bob, looks like those
slugouts have caused slugs to...

45:09.708 --> 45:11.083
bug out.

45:11.083 --> 45:12.250
( chuckles )

45:12.250 --> 45:13.916
Good one, Blast.

45:13.916 --> 45:17.375
First Tad goes missing,
now the slugs?

45:17.375 --> 45:19.291
What's going on?

45:19.291 --> 45:20.958
I don't know.

45:20.958 --> 45:22.458
But whatever it is...

45:22.458 --> 45:24.500
this can't be good.

45:36.541 --> 45:40.083
How far down do you think
it goes?

45:40.083 --> 45:41.916
( laughs )

45:50.125 --> 45:51.625
Hgnh.

46:24.666 --> 46:27.916
Let's track the slugs down
before any more trouble pops up.

46:27.916 --> 46:30.583
Ahhh! Did someone say "track?"

46:30.583 --> 46:31.916
Have no fear.

46:31.916 --> 46:35.208
Pronto the Magnificent
will lead us to the slugs

46:35.208 --> 46:39.166
using his keen tracking methods.

46:39.166 --> 46:41.166
Ya-ha!

46:43.458 --> 46:44.333
( sniffs )

46:44.333 --> 46:46.541
This way.

46:47.750 --> 46:49.791
Sluuuuugs?

46:49.791 --> 46:52.333
Where are youuuu?

46:52.333 --> 46:53.875
Hello?

46:53.875 --> 46:55.500
Anyone?

46:55.500 --> 46:58.750
Where are you slugs?

46:58.750 --> 47:04.625
( synchronized grunting )

47:07.375 --> 47:09.583
Your songs are
building quite a...

47:09.583 --> 47:10.666
...following

47:10.666 --> 47:12.833
( chuckles )

47:15.333 --> 47:19.291
( synchronized grunting )

47:21.083 --> 47:23.083
Great work Pieper,

47:23.083 --> 47:26.250
but these recruits alone
won't be enough.

47:26.250 --> 47:28.833
( synchronized grunting )

47:28.833 --> 47:30.875
We've got the slugs...

47:30.875 --> 47:33.583
Now all we need is
some slingers.

47:33.583 --> 47:34.958
I'll be back soon,

47:34.958 --> 47:36.791
keep an eye on the place
while I'm gone.

47:36.791 --> 47:37.958
Uh-huh.

47:39.375 --> 47:41.875
The slugs are nowhere
to be found.

47:41.875 --> 47:46.750
And if Pronto, the greatest
tracker in the Eastern Caverns,

47:46.750 --> 47:48.291
cannot find them --

47:48.291 --> 47:52.166
then they are truly impossible
to find.

47:52.166 --> 47:54.750
Whoa, look at this?

47:54.750 --> 47:57.291
All the plants are pointing
in the same direction,

47:57.291 --> 47:59.916
like something was dragged
through here.

47:59.916 --> 48:01.416
Perhaps some device

48:01.416 --> 48:06.166
that hinders Pronto's keen
tracking methods.

48:06.166 --> 48:07.791
Yeah, that could be it.

48:07.791 --> 48:08.666
Or...

48:08.666 --> 48:10.500
it's a super slug stampede.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.041
Ha-ha!

48:12.041 --> 48:16.958
You see, Pronto's keen tracking
methods have done it again!

48:16.958 --> 48:19.166
Okay...

48:19.166 --> 48:20.500
I don't get it,

48:20.500 --> 48:23.791
what could be causing this
million mollusk march?

48:23.791 --> 48:25.125
I don't know.

48:25.125 --> 48:27.541
Let's follow them and find
out where they're going.

48:34.708 --> 48:36.291
Keep looking, Mongo.

48:36.291 --> 48:38.833
There's got to be a slug
around here somewhere.

48:38.833 --> 48:42.083
You stooges make me
wanna puke!

48:42.083 --> 48:46.166
It'd take an army of slugs
to pay the Shane Gang back.

48:46.166 --> 48:48.166
Maybe I can help with that.

48:49.375 --> 48:50.666
You again?

48:50.666 --> 48:54.083
Didn't you learn anything
last time?

48:54.083 --> 48:56.583
Plenty, but I'm not here
to fight.

48:56.583 --> 48:58.541
I'm here to offer you
a job.

48:59.708 --> 49:04.458
( laughing )

49:04.458 --> 49:05.416
When do we start?

49:05.416 --> 49:06.750
( chuckles )

49:06.750 --> 49:07.583
Oh...

49:07.583 --> 49:08.416
( nervous chuckles )

49:08.416 --> 49:10.083
sorry.

49:10.083 --> 49:11.875
Work for you?

49:11.875 --> 49:14.166
How about this instead?

49:14.166 --> 49:17.375
We'll take your slugs,
and your ride,

49:17.375 --> 49:22.333
then send you crawling back
to Eli Shane.

49:26.041 --> 49:28.041
( laughs )

49:28.041 --> 49:30.166
Let's play for keeps.

49:30.166 --> 49:32.041
( growls and grunts )

49:32.041 --> 49:33.208
Ghouls?!

49:33.208 --> 49:34.333
You got that right.

49:34.333 --> 49:36.708
Any last words?

49:36.708 --> 49:39.833
( synchronized grunting )

49:39.833 --> 49:41.625
Blakk's old stronghold.

49:41.625 --> 49:44.000
This ain't lookin' good, guys.

49:47.166 --> 49:50.833
The slugs are going right
into the building.

49:50.833 --> 49:52.250
What is that?

49:52.250 --> 49:54.458
It sounds familiar.

49:54.458 --> 49:55.833
Uh-huh.

49:55.833 --> 49:57.166
( grunt )

49:58.500 --> 49:59.666
Huh?

49:59.666 --> 50:00.333
Hup!

50:00.333 --> 50:01.083
Woah.

50:01.083 --> 50:02.083
Huh?

50:02.083 --> 50:05.958
( synchronized grunting )

50:05.958 --> 50:09.458
Wait, what's happening?

50:09.458 --> 50:10.791
Whatever it is,

50:10.791 --> 50:14.250
it seems to be calling the slugs
to Blakk's place.

50:14.250 --> 50:15.708
Hmm?

50:15.708 --> 50:16.958
Hiiiii!

50:16.958 --> 50:18.166
Ahh.

50:18.166 --> 50:19.583
Strange,

50:19.583 --> 50:22.083
it doesn't seem to be effecting
the Megamorphs though.

50:22.083 --> 50:24.458
Something is not right.

50:24.458 --> 50:28.458
Pronto the magnificent will go
to the slugs rescue.

50:28.458 --> 50:29.958
Hold on, Pronto.

50:29.958 --> 50:31.541
We don't know what
we're dealing with yet.

50:31.541 --> 50:33.625
We're not gonna rush
into anything.

50:33.625 --> 50:36.541
Okay. Follow me.

50:39.250 --> 50:41.500
( growls )

50:41.500 --> 50:43.833
Where did you get that?

50:43.833 --> 50:47.000
You'll have to join me
if you want to find out.

50:47.000 --> 50:47.958
( chuckles )

50:47.958 --> 50:49.750
In case you didn't notice,

50:49.750 --> 50:54.625
there's five of us
and only one of you.

50:54.625 --> 50:56.625
That makes our odds...

50:56.625 --> 50:57.750
dughm?

50:57.750 --> 50:58.375
Uhh...

50:58.375 --> 50:59.333
Uh, five to one.

50:59.333 --> 51:01.500
Yeah...

51:01.500 --> 51:03.250
That's good right?

51:03.250 --> 51:05.500
Yeeeaaahhh.

51:05.500 --> 51:06.958
Take your best shot.

51:15.083 --> 51:16.166
Ugh!

51:16.166 --> 51:17.125
Uggghhh.

51:17.125 --> 51:20.083
Those were the boss'
top slugs!

51:20.083 --> 51:21.083
( chirps )

51:21.083 --> 51:22.333
How are those
odds looking now?

51:22.333 --> 51:26.333
So you're better, big deal!

51:26.333 --> 51:28.375
You make me puke.

51:28.375 --> 51:30.875
I can provide everything
you need

51:30.875 --> 51:33.000
to get even with the Shane Gang.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.583
( growls )

51:34.583 --> 51:35.708
Huh?!

51:35.708 --> 51:37.916
No way!

51:37.916 --> 51:39.666
There's more
where these came from.

51:39.666 --> 51:41.166
Lots more.

51:41.166 --> 51:45.083
All you have to do is work
for me.

51:45.083 --> 51:46.916
( chuckles )

51:46.916 --> 51:49.208
Keep talking.

51:49.208 --> 51:56.000
( synchronized grunting )

51:56.000 --> 51:57.666
( straining )

51:59.625 --> 52:01.333
Guaaahhhh!

52:01.333 --> 52:02.333
Uggghhh!

52:02.333 --> 52:03.458
Uhhhhh!

52:03.458 --> 52:04.416
Uogh.

52:04.416 --> 52:06.208
Trixie, any ideas?

52:06.208 --> 52:07.791
Just one.

52:14.708 --> 52:15.375
( laughs )

52:15.375 --> 52:16.750
Nice one.

52:19.500 --> 52:21.708
Heh-uh!

52:21.708 --> 52:24.458
Ahh!

52:24.458 --> 52:27.291
( nervous panting )

52:27.291 --> 52:29.958
Uagh!

52:29.958 --> 52:31.583
Ugh!

52:33.416 --> 52:34.750
( screams )

52:34.750 --> 52:37.333
( echoing scream )

52:37.333 --> 52:38.500
Huh?

52:38.500 --> 52:40.375
Hmm...

52:40.375 --> 52:43.583
I warned you about
following me.

52:43.583 --> 52:46.416
Pronto! Shhhhh.

52:46.416 --> 52:47.333
Uhhh....

52:47.333 --> 52:48.333
( clears throat )

52:48.333 --> 52:49.500
Umm, sorry.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.083
Uh, false alarm.

52:51.083 --> 52:55.000
( synchronized grunting )

52:55.000 --> 52:57.708
I don't like where
this is headed.

52:59.708 --> 53:01.625
( straining )

53:03.166 --> 53:05.208
Oh no.

53:05.208 --> 53:09.916
Blakk's ghouling stuff has
been repaired.

53:09.916 --> 53:13.375
And the slugs are acting
like they want to be ghouled.

53:14.833 --> 53:17.250
Do not worry,
my slimy friends,

53:17.250 --> 53:21.500
for Pronto shall set you free!

53:21.500 --> 53:24.666
Uh...

53:24.666 --> 53:25.833
Hello?

53:25.833 --> 53:27.500
Pronto set you free?

53:27.500 --> 53:29.041
Huh?

53:32.250 --> 53:33.541
( growls )

53:33.541 --> 53:34.500
No!

53:34.500 --> 53:36.333
Why would they just
sit there?

53:36.333 --> 53:38.583
It's like they want
to be ghouled.

53:38.583 --> 53:41.916
That... or something is
controlling them.

53:45.625 --> 53:46.833
( screaming song )

53:46.833 --> 53:47.958
Ugghh!

53:47.958 --> 53:50.000
Uggghhh!

53:50.000 --> 53:53.958
Umm...are you feeling okay?

53:53.958 --> 53:55.000
Ugh!

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Ugh!

53:56.000 --> 53:57.250
Ugh!

53:57.250 --> 54:00.208
What the heck is going
on here, man?

54:00.208 --> 54:01.500
Uh-uh.

54:01.500 --> 54:02.666
Gah!

54:02.666 --> 54:03.750
GAH!

54:03.750 --> 54:08.541
Ah-ha! You are the cause
of this!

54:08.541 --> 54:10.500
( blows raspberry )

54:10.500 --> 54:12.833
( screaming song )

54:12.833 --> 54:14.166
( chirp )

54:14.166 --> 54:19.083
Pronto the Magnificent
to the rescue!

54:22.000 --> 54:22.916
Huh?

54:22.916 --> 54:24.791
( frightened chirping )

54:24.791 --> 54:27.500
Ahh, ugh, uhhhhh...

54:27.500 --> 54:28.916
What happened?

54:28.916 --> 54:32.875
Pronto saved the day once again,
is what happened.

54:32.875 --> 54:34.458
Once again?

54:34.458 --> 54:37.208
When exactly was
the other time?

54:37.208 --> 54:38.541
Pfffttt.

54:38.541 --> 54:42.333
You were all taken out
by the song of that slug!

54:42.333 --> 54:44.125
( giggles )

54:44.125 --> 54:45.333
Pieper?

54:45.333 --> 54:46.791
( growls )

54:46.791 --> 54:48.000
( growls )

54:48.000 --> 54:50.250
Why didn't she affect Pronto?

54:50.250 --> 54:54.375
I guess molenoids are
impervious to "Pieper's charms".

54:54.375 --> 54:55.500
Ju- Wha-

54:55.500 --> 54:58.833
Only because
we have so much charisma,

54:58.833 --> 55:02.250
that no other creatures
can charm us.

55:02.250 --> 55:04.291
Yeah, uhh, I'll accept that.

55:04.291 --> 55:07.416
But right now those slugs are
still under Pieper's control.

55:07.416 --> 55:10.000
Let's focus on the generator
and shut it down.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.666
This time, for good.

55:11.666 --> 55:13.666
That's not going to happen.

55:16.166 --> 55:17.625
Tad?

55:17.625 --> 55:19.041
Are you alright?

55:19.041 --> 55:20.166
( laughs )

55:20.166 --> 55:22.000
I'm better than ever.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.250
Oookkkaaayyy...

55:24.250 --> 55:30.291
( laughs )

55:30.291 --> 55:31.791
( gasps )

55:31.791 --> 55:34.000
I even have my own team now.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.958
Yeah, and he's the toughest
tough guy around.

55:37.958 --> 55:39.125
Grah!

55:40.500 --> 55:43.208
Watch out!

55:43.208 --> 55:47.416
( chirping )

55:47.416 --> 55:48.791
Don't worry, Pieper.

55:48.791 --> 55:51.458
These trespassers will be off
the family estate

55:51.458 --> 55:53.375
any minute now.

55:53.375 --> 55:57.125
Family? What's he talking about?

55:57.125 --> 55:58.625
Don't tell me...

55:58.625 --> 55:59.875
Exactly.

55:59.875 --> 56:03.541
I'm picking up where my feeble
father left off.

56:03.541 --> 56:06.958
Ehhh, Pronto does
not understand.

56:06.958 --> 56:10.458
Can't you tell by the smell,
Molenoid?

56:10.458 --> 56:12.666
( sniff )

56:12.666 --> 56:14.916
Ohhhhhh...

56:14.916 --> 56:16.541
Oh no.

56:16.541 --> 56:18.416
You're Dr. Blakk's son!

56:18.416 --> 56:22.000
Thaddeus D. Blakk,
at your service.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.041
Or should I say...

56:24.041 --> 56:25.500
...your demise.

56:25.500 --> 56:27.291
Tad, we trusted you!

56:27.291 --> 56:31.041
Well, I think I made my
reservations quite clear.

56:31.041 --> 56:32.416
How have you done all this?

56:32.416 --> 56:33.750
Fixing the Ghouling Generator

56:33.750 --> 56:35.875
would have taken more
than a few days.

56:35.875 --> 56:37.125
( laughs )

56:37.125 --> 56:39.666
I may have underestimated
the amount of time

56:39.666 --> 56:41.500
I've been in Slugterra.

56:41.500 --> 56:44.125
So you've been planning
this all along?

56:44.125 --> 56:47.583
Yeah, and once Pieper and I had
everything up and running

56:47.583 --> 56:51.666
I realized I was only missing
one crucial element.

56:51.666 --> 56:53.250
Slugs.

56:53.250 --> 56:55.625
And you were kind enough
to teach me everything

56:55.625 --> 56:57.708
I needed to know, Eli.

56:57.708 --> 57:00.041
I'm glad we met, Shane.

57:00.041 --> 57:02.625
Well Tad, you leave me
no choice.

57:02.625 --> 57:05.458
You are officially out of
the Shane Gang.

57:05.458 --> 57:07.750
Yes! Finally!!

57:07.750 --> 57:09.041
Fire!

57:10.541 --> 57:12.833
Take cover!

57:12.833 --> 57:14.791
Eli! Get down!

57:18.291 --> 57:19.333
No.

57:27.208 --> 57:28.125
Guah!

57:29.916 --> 57:30.583
Guh!

57:30.583 --> 57:32.166
Ugh!

57:32.166 --> 57:33.125
Huh?

57:33.125 --> 57:35.500
Was he always able
to do that?

57:35.500 --> 57:37.291
I dunno.

57:37.291 --> 57:38.583
Heh!

57:38.583 --> 57:39.875
Huh?

57:42.208 --> 57:42.958
Guah!

57:42.958 --> 57:43.916
Ugh!

57:43.916 --> 57:44.625
Geh!

57:44.625 --> 57:45.708
Ugh!

57:45.708 --> 57:46.500
( happy growl )

57:46.500 --> 57:48.125
Good job, buddy.

57:48.125 --> 57:50.958
( synchronize grunts )

57:50.958 --> 57:53.708
Ugh, they're getting a lot of
new ammo.

57:56.166 --> 57:58.500
We have to stop them from
ghouling any more slugs.

57:58.500 --> 58:01.125
Kord... Use Rookie
to get us some cover.

58:01.125 --> 58:02.541
You got it!

58:02.541 --> 58:04.291
Ready to fly, little guy?

58:04.291 --> 58:05.166
( chirps )

58:13.083 --> 58:15.250
Trixie, shut it down.

58:16.708 --> 58:17.708
( chirps )

58:17.708 --> 58:19.041
Ugh!

58:21.166 --> 58:22.041
Ha-ha!

58:26.583 --> 58:27.458
Ugh!

58:36.541 --> 58:37.583
What's going on?

58:37.583 --> 58:38.375
What happened?

58:38.375 --> 58:39.958
( coughs )

58:39.958 --> 58:43.291
That Xmetter slug
has frazzled our blasters!

58:43.291 --> 58:46.333
Clever Shane, but not
clever enough.

58:46.333 --> 58:48.875
There's a reset
override in the central core.

58:48.875 --> 58:51.958
Keep them busy.

58:51.958 --> 58:53.666
Lil Blakk is headed
to the core.

58:53.666 --> 58:55.000
I'm going after him.

58:55.000 --> 58:55.833
( chirps )

58:55.833 --> 58:56.958
Not yet.

58:56.958 --> 58:58.166
Hold on.

58:58.166 --> 59:01.125
( coughs )

59:01.125 --> 59:03.125
( panting )

59:03.125 --> 59:04.583
It's the Shane!

59:04.583 --> 59:06.166
Blast him!

59:06.166 --> 59:07.208
Ugh!

59:07.208 --> 59:09.750
Hey, my shooter's
not shooting.

59:09.750 --> 59:10.958
Ngh.

59:10.958 --> 59:11.958
Ugh!

59:11.958 --> 59:13.541
( blows raspberry )

59:13.541 --> 59:14.625
Now!

59:15.916 --> 59:17.875
Uggghhh!

59:17.875 --> 59:19.666
Ka-b-b-b-b-boom!

59:19.666 --> 59:20.666
Ha-ha!

59:27.375 --> 59:28.750
Woah.

59:32.125 --> 59:35.000
You shouldn't have come
down here, Eli.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
It doesn't have to be this way,
Tad.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.916
You don't have to follow
in your father's footsteps.

59:39.916 --> 59:42.458
Hah! You're one to talk, Shane.

59:42.458 --> 59:45.625
How long have you been following
in your father's footsteps.

59:48.500 --> 59:49.125
Huh?

59:50.083 --> 59:50.916
Hu-woah!

59:52.125 --> 59:53.500
Wo-wo-woooaaahhh!

59:53.500 --> 59:54.208
Heh!

59:54.208 --> 59:55.333
Ugh!

59:55.333 --> 59:58.416
Agh, forgot about the slingshot.

59:58.416 --> 01:00:00.625
( panting )

01:00:00.625 --> 01:00:02.125
Ugh!

01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:04.333
Duah, how are we supposed
to be the Shanes

01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:06.541
without our blasters boss?

01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:09.541
It's still 5 to 3 odds!

01:00:09.541 --> 01:00:11.958
Ha-ha, Right!

01:00:11.958 --> 01:00:14.250
Ahhh, which one are we?

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:18.375
Think about it really hard.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:23.250
We've got to get
the slugs out of there.

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:26.250
( straining )

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:28.833
What you're trying to do
won't work, Tad.

01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:30.958
Ghouled slugs answer
to no one.

01:00:30.958 --> 01:00:33.416
Not even Dr. Blakk
could control them.

01:00:33.416 --> 01:00:35.250
My father was a fool.

01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:44.500
Ugh!

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.458
It's coming back to life.

01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:50.958
Well, let's hope our blasters
don't take much longer to reset.

01:00:50.958 --> 01:00:53.166
I know how you're feeling,
Tad.

01:00:53.166 --> 01:00:55.541
I know what it's like to lose
a father.

01:00:55.541 --> 01:00:57.875
You know nothing about
how I feel!

01:01:00.541 --> 01:01:01.166
Huah!

01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:01.875
Ugh!

01:01:03.458 --> 01:01:04.291
Huh?

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:06.375
Uh-oh.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.666
Huah!

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:09.833
Ugh!

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.291
Goodbye, Eli Shane.

01:01:15.208 --> 01:01:16.333
( giggles )

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:19.541
Huah!

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:22.875
( harsh screeching )

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.166
Ugh!

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:31.125
Haha!

01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:33.083
Use 'em or lose 'em.

01:01:33.083 --> 01:01:34.666
Slug 'em!

01:01:53.333 --> 01:01:54.500
Oh no.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.666
( panicked breathing )

01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:58.750
( chirping )

01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:02.750
Once I found out who I was,

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:05.791
I couldn't bear living
on the surface.

01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:08.333
I came here to claim
my inheritance,

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:11.041
and then I hear that
my dear old dad

01:02:11.041 --> 01:02:14.375
was beaten by a kid
my own age!

01:02:14.375 --> 01:02:16.041
Pathetic.

01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:16.916
( scared chirps )

01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:17.958
Woah!

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:21.166
( panting )

01:02:21.166 --> 01:02:22.250
This isn't good.

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:24.166
We'll have to shut it
down topside.

01:02:24.166 --> 01:02:25.583
Uh-huh.

01:02:28.041 --> 01:02:29.583
What happened down there?

01:02:29.583 --> 01:02:30.916
Ugh!

01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:33.666
Let's just say someone
has daddy issues.

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:36.000
Tad disabled the shutoff
valve in the core.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.583
We'll have to find
another way.

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:43.833
( groan )

01:02:43.833 --> 01:02:45.333
No more playing the odds.

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:53.291
It's time to stack the deck.

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:54.791
( laughs )

01:03:00.083 --> 01:03:03.166
Even the mighty Shane Gang
can't trump six gattlers

01:03:03.166 --> 01:03:05.791
and an army of ghouls!

01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:07.875
Tad, you can't control
the ghouls.

01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:10.000
They'll be the end
of everything!

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.416
You just don't get it,
do yah?

01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:15.166
Ready to take this to
the next level Pieper?

01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:24.583
Oh no, his gattler's got
an accelerator.

01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:39.333
Pieper just went megamorph!

01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:40.333
( laughs )

01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:42.166
Show them what you can do,
girl!

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.791
Agh!

01:03:57.041 --> 01:04:00.166
I am not the Blakk
you defeated, Shane.

01:04:00.166 --> 01:04:01.666
Pieper and I can control
the ghouls

01:04:01.666 --> 01:04:04.000
in a way my father never could!

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:04.708
So.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:05.375
Many.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:06.708
Ghouls!

01:04:06.708 --> 01:04:09.375
Eli, please tell me
you have a plan?

01:04:09.375 --> 01:04:11.458
We gotta' get them away
from all this ghoul ammo.

01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:13.291
On my mark, follow my lead.

01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:15.041
It's just like you said Eli,

01:04:15.041 --> 01:04:17.666
my slugs are part
of the gang now.

01:04:17.666 --> 01:04:20.166
One big, happy family.

01:04:20.166 --> 01:04:20.958
( laughs )

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:22.541
So happy.

01:04:22.541 --> 01:04:23.708
( laughs )

01:04:23.708 --> 01:04:25.208
Scatter!

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.208
( panting )

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:41.208
Oh-h-h yeah!

01:04:42.125 --> 01:04:44.666
Eat my stank!

01:04:46.541 --> 01:04:48.958
Dugh-ugh, nooooo!

01:04:58.125 --> 01:04:58.958
Huah!

01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:11.583
Alright, that should buy us
some time.

01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:18.375
Yes, a chances to re-lax--
oh-uh--

01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:19.125
Oh!

01:05:21.958 --> 01:05:24.750
How great is this, Straggus?

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.708
Our own gattlers, a load of
ghouled slugs,

01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:31.166
and target practice
on the Shane Gang.

01:05:31.166 --> 01:05:34.375
I hate everything,
but I love this!

01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:35.791
( laughs )

01:05:36.708 --> 01:05:38.291
( laughs )

01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:42.833
You got a lot of your old man
in you, Junior.

01:05:42.833 --> 01:05:45.833
I am nobody's "junior,"
Ember.

01:05:45.833 --> 01:05:46.625
Got it?

01:05:46.625 --> 01:05:48.041
( squeaks )

01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:49.041
Good.

01:05:49.041 --> 01:05:50.416
Now, back to work.

01:05:52.291 --> 01:05:53.958
( growls )

01:05:53.958 --> 01:05:55.875
Ugh!

01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:57.416
Without some better cover,

01:05:57.416 --> 01:05:59.416
we're gonna be pounded
into dust.

01:05:59.416 --> 01:06:00.833
Then we better make some.

01:06:00.833 --> 01:06:02.916
You ready to cause some damage,
little buddy?

01:06:02.916 --> 01:06:03.708
Uh-huh.

01:06:03.708 --> 01:06:04.583
Hup!

01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:06.208
And I'm gonna need Bludgeon too.

01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:07.958
( chirps )

01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:22.416
Eli, you know that's coming
down on us, right?

01:06:22.416 --> 01:06:23.416
Yep.

01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:24.708
Just checking.

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:27.833
( grunt )

01:06:27.833 --> 01:06:28.958
( laughs )

01:06:28.958 --> 01:06:30.625
I never doubted you.

01:06:33.875 --> 01:06:34.500
( growls )

01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:38.083
Waaahhh!

01:06:38.083 --> 01:06:38.833
( gasps )

01:06:40.125 --> 01:06:41.250
( pants )

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:42.041
( growls )

01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:44.083
Nyah!

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:44.875
Uggghhh!

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:45.791
Trixie!

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:47.750
Augh!

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:49.750
( maniacally laughs )

01:06:51.416 --> 01:06:52.166
Agh!!

01:06:52.166 --> 01:06:53.416
( coughs )

01:06:55.166 --> 01:06:57.458
She's gonna get blown to bits!

01:07:01.375 --> 01:07:02.750
Waaaahhhh!!!

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:03.708
Ugh!

01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:04.833
Ugh.

01:07:04.833 --> 01:07:05.916
Thanks, pal.

01:07:05.916 --> 01:07:08.791
Ahhh, all part of
the wonderfulness

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:13.791
that is Pronto
the-uhhh--

01:07:13.791 --> 01:07:16.333
Trixie, are you okay?

01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:18.708
I can fight.

01:07:18.708 --> 01:07:21.375
Why don't you go make
some more friends, Pieper?

01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:22.458
( chirps )

01:07:27.708 --> 01:07:30.916
( sings )

01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:32.500
Gotta hand it to Lil' Blakk,

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.666
his dad could never pull off
that kind of control

01:07:34.666 --> 01:07:36.666
over ghouled slugs.

01:07:36.666 --> 01:07:40.291
Yeah, good thing I didn't'
teach him everything I know.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.583
Uuuggghhh!

01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:01.500
Good job, Burpy.

01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:04.125
Why is this taking so long?!

01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:06.625
That Shane Gang ain't easy
to exterminate.

01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:08.208
Trust us, we've tried...

01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:10.083
a lot.

01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:12.166
Well, let's see how my old
gang likes it

01:08:12.166 --> 01:08:15.041
when we turn up the volume,
eh Pieper?

01:08:18.541 --> 01:08:20.375
( sings )

01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:21.207
Guaaahhh!!!

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:22.332
Guuhh-uggghhh!

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:24.541
Geh-gugh-uggghhh!

01:08:24.541 --> 01:08:27.707
It's shooting...through
to my bones.

01:08:27.707 --> 01:08:29.082
Can't...move...

01:08:29.082 --> 01:08:30.625
Of course, pronto feels fine.

01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:33.875
But then again, Molenoid
toughness is legendary in--

01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:36.000
Finish 'em off.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.375
I've got slugs to ghoul.

01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:40.457
With pleasure.

01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:45.291
Great work, Pieper.

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:47.457
( panting )

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:51.791
Tough to be tough when
you're not as tough as the...

01:08:51.791 --> 01:08:53.125
uh, Tough Guys.

01:08:53.125 --> 01:08:54.707
What's the matter Ember?

01:08:54.707 --> 01:08:55.832
Not slinger enough...

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:57.041
to beat me...

01:08:57.041 --> 01:08:58.416
in a fair fight?

01:08:58.416 --> 01:08:59.832
Yeah, that sounds about right.

01:08:59.832 --> 01:09:02.957
Just for that, you don't get
to waste anybody.

01:09:02.957 --> 01:09:06.332
But I love wasting people.

01:09:06.332 --> 01:09:12.541
This makes me so happy
I could puke!

01:09:12.541 --> 01:09:14.416
( fart )

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.416
What?

01:09:16.416 --> 01:09:19.416
So long, Shane Gang...

01:09:19.416 --> 01:09:21.041
( distant screams )

01:09:21.041 --> 01:09:22.416
What's that noise?

01:09:23.875 --> 01:09:24.875
Uggghhh!

01:09:24.875 --> 01:09:26.250
Huh?

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:27.791
( hiss )

01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:29.916
Shadow Clan!

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:35.666
Those miserable slug-huggers
scare the puke out of me!

01:09:35.666 --> 01:09:37.582
What are the Shadow Clan
doing here?

01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:40.625
Must've been drawn here by
the all the ghouled slug energy.

01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:41.707
Guah!

01:09:41.707 --> 01:09:43.166
But they're still on OUR side,
right?

01:09:43.166 --> 01:09:45.541
Cause that was really close.

01:09:45.541 --> 01:09:49.750
( raspy hissing )

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.416
Hold on.

01:09:51.416 --> 01:09:54.500
( raspy hiss )... is going
on here, Son of Shane?

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.833
I was fooled.

01:09:55.833 --> 01:09:58.291
Tad is really Dr. Blakk's
son and he wants to get

01:09:58.291 --> 01:10:01.333
into the family business of
ghouling slugs.

01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:06.666
Those who harm slugs
will parish!

01:10:06.666 --> 01:10:07.708
Wait!

01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:08.833
With all those gattlers
and ghouls,

01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:10.791
a frontal attack
will take too long.

01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:13.208
Meanwhile, they keep
ghouling more slugs.

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:15.833
If one slinger could make it
past their defenses...

01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:17.500
Wonder who that could be?

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:20.250
Get me inside and I'll cut off
their ghoul supply.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.958
But how are you going to get
past those gattlers?

01:10:22.958 --> 01:10:25.666
I'll figure it out
when I get there.

01:10:25.666 --> 01:10:27.375
( disconcertingly chuckles )

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:30.916
The Shadow Clan
will draw the slug fire.

01:10:30.916 --> 01:10:33.625
Protect the Shane.

01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:34.750
Uh-huh!

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:38.375
Heh-guah!

01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:39.125
Hegh-ugh.

01:10:39.125 --> 01:10:40.125
Ugh.

01:10:40.125 --> 01:10:42.041
That Shane's brain
went floppers.

01:10:42.041 --> 01:10:45.000
Maybe, but he's got
a lot of guts.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.791
Oh yes he does...

01:10:46.791 --> 01:10:50.291
till we splatter them
all over this cavern.

01:10:50.291 --> 01:10:51.583
( growling )

01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:52.375
Huah.

01:10:52.375 --> 01:10:53.375
Ugh.

01:10:57.666 --> 01:11:00.625
( pants )

01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:02.875
Ugh.

01:11:02.875 --> 01:11:03.875
Huh?

01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:06.583
Trixie! Go!

01:11:13.166 --> 01:11:15.458
C'mon, show yourself, hero!

01:11:17.125 --> 01:11:19.708
( grunts )

01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:25.166
( grunts )

01:11:25.166 --> 01:11:27.750
Were we supposed
to close that?

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.791
Eh, he's junior's
problem now.

01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:35.625
( psychotically laughs )

01:11:37.875 --> 01:11:39.333
Okay, Eli's in.

01:11:39.333 --> 01:11:42.041
Now let's figure out our end
of the plan.

01:11:42.041 --> 01:11:49.166
Those who harm slugs
will parish!

01:11:49.166 --> 01:11:51.833
The language barrier's
gonna be an issue.

01:11:56.416 --> 01:11:57.833
( laughs )

01:11:57.833 --> 01:12:01.000
You don't have to be like
your father, you know.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.666
You have nothing to prove
to anyone.

01:12:03.666 --> 01:12:06.083
I could say the same to you,
"Shane."

01:12:15.583 --> 01:12:20.583
( sings )

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.791
You can't out sling me, Tad.

01:12:27.791 --> 01:12:31.750
Oh, I know that,
but my question is...

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:35.083
Why would you bring a
blaster to a gattler fight?

01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:40.208
Ugh!

01:12:40.208 --> 01:12:41.708
How's it going, Kord?

01:12:41.708 --> 01:12:47.625
You TEL-E-PORT closer and
CLOSER and we will COVER YOU.

01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:49.166
UNDERSTAND?

01:12:49.166 --> 01:12:54.666
Those who harm slugs
will perish!

01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:55.708
Do not fear.

01:12:55.708 --> 01:12:57.791
If they can learn
our language,

01:12:57.791 --> 01:12:59.916
Pronto can learn theirs.

01:12:59.916 --> 01:13:01.166
( clears throat )

01:13:01.166 --> 01:13:03.916
( raspy hisses )

01:13:03.916 --> 01:13:06.916
( deeply inhales )

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:08.333
Okay? We good?

01:13:08.333 --> 01:13:09.708
( raspy hisses )

01:13:09.708 --> 01:13:12.625
Ugh. Must have been my accent.

01:13:12.625 --> 01:13:14.666
Let's keep it simple.

01:13:14.666 --> 01:13:20.916
I sling a Dirt Urchin, then you
sling a Hop Rock, and...

01:13:20.916 --> 01:13:22.708
Needlesploder!

01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:25.458
( raspy hissing )

01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:27.000
You think he got it?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.708
Let's find out.

01:13:34.291 --> 01:13:35.500
Ugh, look out!

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.875
Needlesploder!

01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:40.291
Wuaggghhh!

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.833
Yeah-he-he-hah!

01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:43.375
Score!

01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:45.541
Oh yeah, up high!

01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:48.541
Okay, we'll work
on that later.

01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:51.000
Let's kick some
Tough Guy tail!

01:13:59.708 --> 01:14:00.916
Eugh!

01:14:00.916 --> 01:14:02.916
Why don't they give up?

01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:05.666
They just keep comin'!

01:14:05.666 --> 01:14:10.166
Yeah, those hero types are
real puke makers that way.

01:14:10.166 --> 01:14:12.250
Gonna beat'em like a drum,
right boss?

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.208
( laughs )

01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:14.875
Uh, boss?

01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:16.541
Keep up the good work, boys!

01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:21.916
Come on out, Eli.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:24.166
You can't hide forever.

01:14:24.166 --> 01:14:26.666
Ugh!

01:14:26.666 --> 01:14:28.541
Uh-don't shoot!

01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:30.000
Why shouldn't I, huh?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.916
The Shane is running
around in here.

01:14:31.916 --> 01:14:33.583
What part of "finish them off"

01:14:33.583 --> 01:14:36.541
was too complicated for that
wart-filled brain of yours?

01:14:36.541 --> 01:14:40.041
Uh, I sense this is
a trick question?

01:14:40.041 --> 01:14:41.958
Listen carefully.

01:14:41.958 --> 01:14:44.250
If they manage to take
the power core offline,

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.708
then I take you offline...

01:14:46.708 --> 01:14:47.916
( growls )

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:49.500
...permanently.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:53.625
A little too much like
your old man... Junior.

01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:55.833
( chirps )

01:14:55.833 --> 01:14:59.875
( sings )

01:14:59.875 --> 01:15:01.000
( blows raspberry )

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:05.000
( growls )

01:15:10.041 --> 01:15:12.083
( growls )

01:15:12.083 --> 01:15:13.791
Huh?

01:15:13.791 --> 01:15:15.166
Wuuuoah!

01:15:15.166 --> 01:15:18.833
Awww, my gattler's broke!

01:15:18.833 --> 01:15:21.208
We don't need no
stinkin' gattlers!

01:15:21.208 --> 01:15:22.875
We're the Tough Guys!

01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:24.208
Yeah!

01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:28.333
We're the baddest slug slingers
in the 99 caverns!

01:15:28.333 --> 01:15:31.500
CHARGE!!!

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.250
Oh crud.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.750
( coughs )

01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:40.083
( wheezes )

01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:42.541
You mean, you guys are the worst
slug slingers

01:15:42.541 --> 01:15:44.750
in the 99 caverns.

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.791
Uh, yeah.

01:15:49.458 --> 01:15:51.500
The ghouling core's
gonna be underneath.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.125
Anybody see an access hatch?

01:15:58.291 --> 01:16:00.125
...or we could just make
our own.

01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:05.833
What's wrong Eli,
running out of slugs?

01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:09.333
Burpy, I hope you're okay.

01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:12.875
( growling )

01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:14.000
( laughs )

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.875
( growling )

01:16:17.666 --> 01:16:19.291
( chirps )

01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:22.625
( growls )

01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:24.833
Agh!

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:28.750
( laughing )

01:16:37.708 --> 01:16:39.500
Burpy, you're alright!

01:16:44.541 --> 01:16:46.000
Ahhhhh!

01:17:01.708 --> 01:17:04.333
Give 'em everything ya got.

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:05.791
Fire!

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:11.125
Remember us?!

01:17:11.125 --> 01:17:14.583
That ugly toad makes
Pronto want to puke.

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:15.958
Really?

01:17:15.958 --> 01:17:17.291
What?

01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:22.000
Time's up, Eli!

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.250
I have all the ghouled slugs
I need

01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:27.541
to rule the 99 caverns
and beyond.

01:17:27.541 --> 01:17:29.875
You rely too much
on the dark water.

01:17:29.875 --> 01:17:31.916
Your father made
the same mistake.

01:17:31.916 --> 01:17:33.541
I am not my father!

01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:34.833
You got that right.

01:17:34.833 --> 01:17:36.625
He was a genius.

01:17:36.625 --> 01:17:38.458
Glad I'm not facing him.

01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:42.291
I will prove to everyone that
I am twice the genius he was!

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.416
I'm not so sure about that.

01:17:44.416 --> 01:17:46.208
Wave "Hello" to Burpy.

01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:47.166
Huh?

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:49.500
Ugh!

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.333
Ahhhhh!

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:52.333
( chirps )

01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:53.333
Thanks, buddy.

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:54.666
What would I do without yah?

01:17:56.208 --> 01:17:58.583
Umm, where'd he go?

01:17:58.583 --> 01:18:00.416
Boss Ember's right in front
of the valve

01:18:00.416 --> 01:18:02.208
controlling the dark water.

01:18:02.208 --> 01:18:05.666
We need a direct hit if we want
any hope of taking it offline.

01:18:05.666 --> 01:18:08.541
This is a shot only Pronto
can make.

01:18:08.541 --> 01:18:11.500
And I am the only me
I know.

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.083
( chirps )

01:18:13.083 --> 01:18:14.541
Stand aside!

01:18:14.541 --> 01:18:17.041
Pronto, that's a one
in a million shot.

01:18:17.041 --> 01:18:20.458
Good thing that one in a million
is my speciality.

01:18:25.833 --> 01:18:26.791
Huh?

01:18:26.791 --> 01:18:29.041
Sling and a miss,
Molenoid!

01:18:29.041 --> 01:18:30.291
( clears throat )

01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:33.166
Yes, uh, now that I have
taken my practice shot,

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:34.125
heh-heh...

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:35.958
anybody have a Speedstinger?

01:18:35.958 --> 01:18:37.416
( laughs )

01:18:37.416 --> 01:18:38.541
Run!

01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:42.250
( chirps )

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.208
There you are, Pipes.

01:18:43.208 --> 01:18:44.500
Just in time.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.250
Ahhhhh!

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:45.833
Huh?

01:18:45.833 --> 01:18:46.500
Eugh!

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:47.250
Ugh!

01:18:51.791 --> 01:18:52.791
Okay...

01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:54.666
The fifth time is always
the charm.

01:18:54.666 --> 01:18:55.416
( laughs )

01:18:55.416 --> 01:18:57.333
You are such a bad shot,

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.625
I can not even puke anymore.

01:18:59.625 --> 01:19:01.250
( dry heaves )

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.291
See? Nothing.

01:19:03.291 --> 01:19:04.875
Oh yeah, well-oh-oh-ohhhh!

01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:06.458
Hey! Wait!

01:19:07.208 --> 01:19:09.041
Ahhhhh!

01:19:09.041 --> 01:19:11.375
Geroni-mole!

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.166
AUGH!

01:19:16.166 --> 01:19:18.083
I wish I'd thought of that.

01:19:19.541 --> 01:19:20.416
No!

01:19:21.833 --> 01:19:22.500
Wah-wuh-oh.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.500
Hey! Watch it!

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.333
Hey-ho-ho.

01:19:24.333 --> 01:19:25.041
Hah. You missed me!

01:19:25.041 --> 01:19:25.833
Wah-oah.

01:19:25.833 --> 01:19:26.416
Woah.

01:19:26.416 --> 01:19:28.000
Ugh.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.541
Ha-ha. You see, you feel for
Pronto's clever trap and...

01:19:31.541 --> 01:19:34.041
uh, did his work for him,
hehe!

01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:36.166
Great job guys, now
let's get out of here

01:19:36.166 --> 01:19:38.458
before the whole
place collapses.

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:43.000
Uh oh. Every slime
bag for himself!

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.291
( pants )

01:19:44.291 --> 01:19:45.291
Uh!

01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:49.458
Those who harm slugs
will perish!

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:51.750
Oh. Hi.

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:53.750
I admire your work
with the slugs.

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:54.708
Big Fan.

01:19:54.708 --> 01:19:55.291
Ahh!

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:56.416
Ugh!!!

01:19:59.791 --> 01:20:01.250
It's over, Tad.

01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:04.958
Hold it right there or I'll
squish your favorite slug!

01:20:04.958 --> 01:20:06.958
Maybe? Maybe not?

01:20:06.958 --> 01:20:08.250
Bake him, Burpy!

01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.500
Graaaahhhh!

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.541
Looks like your plans
are falling apart,

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:14.416
along with everything else
around here, "junior."

01:20:14.416 --> 01:20:18.833
No wonder my father
hated you!

01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:21.708
The dark water shockwaves
are building!

01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:25.125
Ugh-guh.

01:20:25.125 --> 01:20:26.333
Haaahhh.

01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:34.083
( grunts )

01:20:34.083 --> 01:20:35.291
Yaaaah!!!!

01:20:35.291 --> 01:20:36.583
Ugh!!!!

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:39.000
You're going down Shane,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.583
even if it's the
last thing I do!

01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:44.083
Ugh-guah-ugh.

01:20:44.083 --> 01:20:46.458
Gahhhhh!

01:20:46.458 --> 01:20:47.541
NOOO!

01:20:48.708 --> 01:20:49.541
Eguh-ugh.

01:20:49.541 --> 01:20:50.708
Uggghhh.

01:20:54.125 --> 01:20:56.333
I got you, Tad.

01:20:56.333 --> 01:20:59.791
You just can't help yourself,
can you, Eli?

01:20:59.791 --> 01:21:01.250
Always a hero.

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:03.791
( raspy hisses )

01:21:05.916 --> 01:21:09.125
( raspy hisses )

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:13.041
Dugh-ahhhhh!

01:21:13.041 --> 01:21:14.250
Shaaannneee!

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:15.791
UGH!

01:21:17.041 --> 01:21:18.333
( chirps )

01:21:25.166 --> 01:21:28.750
Uh, thanks.

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:31.583
You know, we are getting
pretty good

01:21:31.583 --> 01:21:34.083
at knocking people down holes.

01:21:34.083 --> 01:21:37.416
Yeah. Just not getting them
back out.

01:21:44.416 --> 01:21:46.541
Thank you for coming
to our aid.

01:21:46.541 --> 01:21:49.791
We came for the slugs.

01:21:49.791 --> 01:21:53.458
And now we must attend
to the ghouls.

01:21:53.458 --> 01:21:55.416
It was a mistake trusting Tad,

01:21:55.416 --> 01:21:57.583
but I promise we'll
work hard to regain the trust

01:21:57.583 --> 01:21:59.083
of the Shadow Clan.

01:21:59.083 --> 01:22:04.458
The Shadow Clan will be your
allies again, Son of Shane.

01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:09.125
But, our trust will be hard
to win back.

01:22:17.875 --> 01:22:20.791
Pronto, can you help me
with something?

01:22:20.791 --> 01:22:22.000
What thing?

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.208
You know, that thing
we talked about?

01:22:25.208 --> 01:22:27.000
I know of no thing.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I think you do!

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.750
Just get over here already.

01:22:33.666 --> 01:22:35.083
Hello again.

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:41.250
Son of Shane, I have a message
from your father.

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:42.875
My dad?

01:22:42.875 --> 01:22:44.416
Okay.

01:22:46.791 --> 01:22:48.166
Thank you.

01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:01.083
Oh, I hate this part.

01:23:01.083 --> 01:23:02.041
Ugh!

01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:04.583
Dad?

01:23:04.583 --> 01:23:06.791
Eli, if you're hearing this
message it means that

01:23:06.791 --> 01:23:09.208
something incredible
has happened.

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.333
What?

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:12.250
You turned 16!

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:14.333
Happy Birthday son!

01:23:14.333 --> 01:23:15.291
Huh?

01:23:15.291 --> 01:23:16.083
I missed it.

01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:17.666
I missed my own birthday.

01:23:17.666 --> 01:23:19.541
I made this because
I'm pretty sure

01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:22.041
I won't be there
for your 16th.

01:23:22.041 --> 01:23:23.375
Even though I'm not there,

01:23:23.375 --> 01:23:25.333
I want you to know
that I love you,

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.250
and I'm very proud of you.

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:29.541
You've still got so much
ahead of you,

01:23:29.541 --> 01:23:33.291
so relax, and have some fun
on your birthday.

01:23:33.291 --> 01:23:36.583
Goodbye son.

01:23:36.583 --> 01:23:38.166
Bye dad.

01:23:38.166 --> 01:23:40.125
I really miss you.

01:23:40.125 --> 01:23:41.375
You heard?

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:51.333
Thanks guys.

01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:54.000
( singing ) For he's a jolly
good fellow, for he's...

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.541
a jolly... good...

01:23:56.541 --> 01:23:59.291
What?! I thought we were doing
the thing?

01:23:59.291 --> 01:24:02.041
Alright, you heard my dad.

01:24:02.041 --> 01:24:03.375
Let's have some cake.

01:24:03.375 --> 01:24:05.458
( laughing )

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:06.958
Oh yeah. I love cake.

01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:08.583
My favorite's chocolate.

01:24:18.958 --> 01:24:24.416
( sings )

01:24:24.416 --> 01:24:25.041
Huh?

01:24:25.041 --> 01:24:25.791
Guah!

01:24:25.791 --> 01:24:27.125
Huah-ugh-ugh.

01:24:48.791 --> 01:24:50.375
( chirping )

01:24:50.375 --> 01:24:53.458
No need for such a sad song,
Pipes.

01:24:53.458 --> 01:24:55.666
It's gonna be all right.
