06:24.091 --> 06:26.457
jack, if Semco moves
one goddamn point up...

06:26.527 --> 06:28.461
it's four million in margin
we're liable for.

06:28.529 --> 06:31.794
It'll slide down. What about Bressler?
Didn't they position with us?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.462
No? Sullivan?

06:34.535 --> 06:37.163
It's like we got the goddamn clap
all of a sudden.

06:37.238 --> 06:39.206
Whiskey, rocks, and a club soda.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.207
- Hi. How you doin'?
- How are you?

06:41.275 --> 06:44.039
Marcus will stand by us
if we lose a point or two.

06:44.111 --> 06:47.137
He said he's thinking about it.
Semco's still trading.

06:47.214 --> 06:51.014
- He said he didn't know.
- He said he didn't know?

06:51.085 --> 06:53.144
jesus, that son of a bitch!

06:53.220 --> 06:55.279
We started him.
He owes us!

06:56.357 --> 06:58.985
Come on. Table.

06:59.060 --> 06:59.193
So, the guy says to me, the horse

06:59.193 --> 07:02.185
So, the guy says to me, the horse
was gelded light. What do I know?

07:02.263 --> 07:05.494
He said the horse was gelded light.
I'm thinkin' to myself--

07:09.036 --> 07:11.596
- Mr. Casey, telephone call.
- Thank you.

07:14.842 --> 07:16.275
Excuse me.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.083

Okay, thank you.

07:40.968 --> 07:43.732
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

07:45.039 --> 07:48.304
The buyout took place.
Semco just closed at 30.

08:13.401 --> 08:14.834
Mom?

08:20.007 --> 08:22.237
Dad?

08:27.448 --> 08:30.849
- What is it, Son?
- Dad...

08:30.918 --> 08:33.977
we've had some trouble.

08:34.054 --> 08:38.515
See, we had this deal
that was goin', and...

08:38.592 --> 08:41.924
we were sellin'
very heavily on margin.

08:41.996 --> 08:44.829
We didn't expect
this buyout to happen...

08:44.899 --> 08:49.268
- which, unfortunately, it did, and--
- How bad is it, Son?

08:51.739 --> 08:52.865
Bad.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.010
I lost it all.

09:00.614 --> 09:01.979
Everything.

09:03.818 --> 09:08.619
And you and Mom--your savings.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.028
Oh,jesus.

09:24.638 --> 09:29.337
Hey. We're Caseys.
We can take a punch, right?

09:30.744 --> 09:32.234
There'll be other days, Son.

09:36.650 --> 09:38.083
I was just gonna make a sandwich.

09:38.152 --> 09:42.054
Nice roast beef,
salt and pepper, mayonnaise.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.889

- No. No, I can't. Thanks.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.452
Come on. Your mother'll be
right back from the beauty parlor.

09:49.530 --> 09:51.464
She'll be mad if you leave
without seeing her.

09:51.532 --> 09:54.933
No, I got a taxi waitin',
and I got some other people--

09:55.002 --> 09:57.232
I got some things-- I can't.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.368
Don't you worry about us, Son.

10:09.183 --> 10:13.051
You're gonna take a minute,
catch your breath, get right back.

10:13.120 --> 10:16.886
- Right?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.761
Won't change your mind?

10:22.897 --> 10:24.831
No, I gotta go.

10:51.926 --> 10:54.019
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.

10:58.032 --> 11:01.399
Falcons leading six to nothing,
and it's the Wildcats'ball now...

11:01.468 --> 11:04.494
on their own 20-yard line
as Norm Shuter, the quarterback...

11:04.572 --> 11:06.767
spinning and handing off
to Carnie Foster.

11:06.840 --> 11:10.640
He's loose at the 25, 30, 35--
he may go all the way--

11:10.711 --> 11:12.770

and this game is all tied up--

11:26.493 --> 11:29.792
six and six, Wildcats and Falcons.

13:24.511 --> 13:25.944

14:35.349 --> 14:38.147

14:38.218 --> 14:39.947
That's right, the mayor.

14:40.020 --> 14:43.922

He's a ballet dancer.

14:54.234 --> 14:56.702
Really!
That's Teddy Bear and Airborne.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.830
Airborne over there was gonna
be the middleweight champion.

14:59.907 --> 15:02.341
Teddy Bear's just saving up
to go back to college.

15:03.310 --> 15:06.905
Educated and Dedicated.
They used to be college professors.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.175
The rest of'em around here

Come and go's.

15:17.624 --> 15:20.422
Don't worry.
I'll hack it.

15:28.268 --> 15:30.429
They harpooned you again, Peewee.

15:30.504 --> 15:32.631

Yeah, my father's in the air force.
He's a jet pilot.

15:53.527 --> 15:56.963
- Yeah? No kiddin'?
- Yeah. He won a medal once.

15:57.030 --> 16:00.363
Yeah, for savin' his buddies in a
plane crash. They went down in the war.

16:00.434 --> 16:03.130
His arms were all burned
and his hair too.

16:03.203 --> 16:06.604
That's why he doesn't have eyebrows.
They never grew back.

16:07.407 --> 16:09.204
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

16:11.111 --> 16:15.275
So, if you're gonna work here,
you're gonna need some wheels.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.750
Tell you what,

brand-new tires...

16:21.288 --> 16:23.950

16:32.833 --> 16:34.824

16:38.305 --> 16:40.933
Five down, five a week...

16:41.008 --> 16:42.976
till you pay me 5 5.

16:43.043 --> 16:47.810
- You just said 50!
- On time payments, you pay interest.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.815
I know that much.

17:00.327 --> 17:03.728
- My man, it's a mean machine.
- Yo, look, don't touch.

17:03.797 --> 17:05.458
Okay, man.
I won't touch your bike.

17:05.531 --> 17:08.160
What you doin' with these
chicken bones around your neck?

17:08.234 --> 17:10.863
Man, be more respectful
of your African heritage.

17:15.175 --> 17:19.373
Youngblood, I want coffee.
I want it light.

17:19.445 --> 17:20.970
I want it sweet.

17:21.048 --> 17:23.608

- Okay, okay!

17:27.020 --> 17:28.715
Money, money, money.

17:29.823 --> 17:32.849
He makes all that money
bein' a messenger?

17:32.926 --> 17:35.895
Yeah, well, he's not too particular
what he carries...

17:36.697 --> 17:39.131
and for who.

17:43.370 --> 17:45.838
It's gonna be a good day today.

17:48.709 --> 17:50.870
Spider. Do me a favor,

17:50.944 --> 17:52.377

18:55.842 --> 18:59.005
- Hi there.
- Hi. I'm busy right now.

18:59.079 --> 19:01.809
You're busy right now?
Oh, really?

20:33.073 --> 20:35.701
Aw. Poor baby.

20:36.977 --> 20:39.002
You think you're so tough.

21:48.915 --> 21:51.850
Can I get anything else
for you, dearie?

21:51.918 --> 21:54.318
I had five bucks, and I don't know
what I did with it.

21:54.387 --> 21:56.878
- Hey,joey.
- Yeah, what is it?

21:56.957 --> 22:00.825
- Another bum-- no money.
- No, I did have it. I swear to God.

22:00.894 --> 22:05.593
- I've heard that before.
- Where the hell did I put it?

22:07.367 --> 22:10.825
I gave him a five,
I put five in my pocket--

22:16.443 --> 22:19.173
- Hey, Pete.
- What's your name?

22:19.246 --> 22:21.339
What's it to you, huh?

22:24.017 --> 22:27.919
I just want to know who
I'm loaning five bucks to.

22:37.197 --> 22:41.531
- Where you from, Terri?
- DC.

22:51.778 --> 22:53.211
Thanks.

22:55.382 --> 22:56.815
Thank you.

23:15.502 --> 23:18.869
- Three.
- Five.

23:29.316 --> 23:30.749
That's too much.

23:32.919 --> 23:35.387
Five... or get out.

23:48.768 --> 23:52.704
Okay. We'll take 'em.
Five thousand.

23:53.573 --> 23:55.507
Come on, come on.

23:55.575 --> 23:57.008
Take it.

24:16.596 --> 24:18.860
No, I haven't seen him for a while.

24:18.932 --> 24:21.765
Yeah, I know.
It's business before pleasure, baby.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.928
- I gotta go now.
- Catch you later.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.437
Bye.

24:30.777 --> 24:32.711
Hey, Gypsy.
What's happenin'?

24:32.779 --> 24:34.610
- What is this?
- Huh?

24:34.681 --> 24:39.414
You deliver short,
hustle my customers for yourself?

24:39.486 --> 24:43.320
- What you talkin' about, man?
- You don't work for me no more.

24:44.624 --> 24:47.252
Go back to bumpin' envelopes.

24:48.161 --> 24:49.287
Disappear.

24:51.731 --> 24:54.291
The street is
free enterprise, Gypsy.

24:55.301 --> 24:56.734
You work your side...

24:56.803 --> 24:58.737
I work mine.

25:16.923 --> 25:18.515
Come on, man!

25:40.880 --> 25:43.747
Emilio, let me have a hot dog
with everything on it...

25:43.817 --> 25:47.116
and a vegetarian
for my friend here.

25:47.187 --> 25:49.519
It's ''cherridy,'' man.
Beautiful.

25:49.589 --> 25:52.490
Look at the wheels.
They're new.

25:52.559 --> 25:54.993
Yeah, well, almost new.

25:55.061 --> 25:58.861
And dig, man, it's got two sections--
got your hot dogs, got your ices.

26:00.467 --> 26:03.698
The umbrella, I'd get rid of that.
I'd put my own, you know.

26:03.770 --> 26:06.568
Thank you.
''Hector's Hot Dogs.''

26:06.639 --> 26:08.800
- Uh-huh.
- So, what do you think, man?

26:08.875 --> 26:10.968
You know what I think?

26:12.445 --> 26:16.404
I think you're gonna get flat feet
standin' in one place.

26:16.483 --> 26:19.509
Ah, there's no future on a bike.
You fall, you get hurt...

26:19.586 --> 26:22.146
you can't work, no money.

26:23.256 --> 26:25.850
Look, I want something
to look forward to.

26:26.926 --> 26:29.019
Can't stay on a bike forever, man.

26:35.401 --> 26:37.460
Seventh Avenue, two of'em, Shortstop.
Go ahead.

26:37.537 --> 26:40.267
I'm telling you, they would never
kick a door down, not my guys.

26:40.340 --> 26:41.773
Apache, Midway. Go.

26:42.675 --> 26:44.302
Whoa.

26:44.377 --> 26:46.538
Excuse me.
You dropped somethin'.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.275
Thanks.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.248
All right!

29:08.821 --> 29:12.154
Come on. Come on, fellas.
Back to work.

29:26.639 --> 29:30.075
Anyway, I see interest rates
going down.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.737
The Fed is expanding the money supply,
so I would...

29:32.812 --> 29:36.680
move to decrease our cash position,
increase stock equity.

29:36.749 --> 29:39.013
Yeah, but not yet.

29:39.085 --> 29:41.246
Interest rates'll bump
a few more points first, man.

29:41.321 --> 29:45.690
I'd buy high tech-- I BM, Teledyne.
What?

29:45.758 --> 29:48.022
That's what old man Anderson said.

29:48.094 --> 29:51.291
I wasn't sure. Now I am.

29:54.067 --> 29:56.535
Listen,jack.

29:58.004 --> 30:00.734
I wanna be straight with you.
Anderson wants to back us.

30:00.807 --> 30:04.641
But it's you they really want.
I'm just part of the package.

30:04.711 --> 30:07.236
I mean, not that I'm not good.

30:07.313 --> 30:11.079
I make that jerk Anderson
look like a hero.

30:11.150 --> 30:13.084
But I don't have half
of what you have.

30:15.888 --> 30:17.981
You had the touch,jack.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.657
Anyway, he'll back us 1 00%%.

30:25.732 --> 30:28.895
I spoke to the lawyers, Burke and Blum.
They're the best.

30:28.968 --> 30:33.132
Two years, three years tops,
we buy out Anderson's interest.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.401
jack, we'd be back
in business our way.

30:35.475 --> 30:39.571
Gabe, I'm happy for ya. I am.
But... I can't.

30:39.645 --> 30:44.207
- What do you mean, can't?
- Look, you're my friend. The best.

30:44.283 --> 30:47.150
I know you want it to be like it was,
but it's not for me.

30:48.154 --> 30:49.416
Not now.

30:49.489 --> 30:53.118
You're telling me that driving a bike
and delivering junk, that's for you?

30:53.192 --> 30:55.592
I don't believe it,jack.
I don't.

31:03.102 --> 31:06.560
- If not now,jack, when?
- Gabe, don't you understand?

31:06.639 --> 31:08.106
I don't have it anymore.

31:16.916 --> 31:19.111
I don't have the nerve.

31:21.521 --> 31:26.254
Okay... you see, that was my--

31:26.325 --> 31:28.259
That's what drove me.

31:29.862 --> 31:31.853
And it went that day.

31:32.932 --> 31:36.732
I don't know where it went,
you know, but it's gone.

31:43.476 --> 31:45.808
You see, now all I'm
responsible for is me.

31:45.878 --> 31:49.211
Okay? I pick up here, I deliver there.
It's simple.

31:49.282 --> 31:52.046
Nobody worries, nobody gets hurt.

31:52.118 --> 31:55.747
I pay my rent...
I got a couple extra bucks.

31:55.822 --> 31:58.086
If I need more,
I work a few more runs.

32:03.095 --> 32:06.826
And... when I'm on the street,
I feel good, man.

32:06.899 --> 32:08.833
I feel good.

32:08.901 --> 32:12.132
I feel... exhilarated.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.873
I go as fast as I like--
faster than anyone.

32:15.942 --> 32:18.069
A street sign says ''One Way, East,''
I go west.

32:18.144 --> 32:20.078
They can't touch me.

32:21.547 --> 32:25.381
When I'm on a bike, I forget about--

32:25.451 --> 32:26.850
Well, I don't know.

32:31.290 --> 32:34.350
- Hey, no, no, no.
- No, I got it. I got it.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.265
Thanks for the coffee.

32:53.145 --> 32:56.171
Hey, what's that mean
right there,jack?

32:56.249 --> 32:59.116
- Collateral.
- Right. What's ''collateral'' mean?

33:00.686 --> 33:03.314
What's this? ''Loan application.''
What are you doin'?

33:04.190 --> 33:07.887
I'm borrowing some money--
you know, for the cart.

33:11.430 --> 33:12.863
So?

33:14.267 --> 33:17.293
- So, what?
- So, what does ''collateral'' mean?

33:17.370 --> 33:20.271
It means you ain't gettin' no loan.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.307
What it means is you've
gotta have capital goods.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.971
- Capital goods?
- Yeah.

33:27.046 --> 33:30.015
Something that is worth the same amount
or more than the principal.

33:30.082 --> 33:32.778
The principal is the amount of money
that you want to borrow.

33:32.852 --> 33:36.310
- Seven grand.
- Right. You got something worth $7,000?

33:36.389 --> 33:39.790
Oh, yeah.
His pretty ass on the street!

33:39.859 --> 33:41.292
Let me get this straight.

33:41.360 --> 33:46.127
You mean I gotta have something worth
seven Gs if I wanna borrow seven Gs?

33:46.198 --> 33:48.132
- Right.
- Shit, if I had something...

33:48.200 --> 33:51.135
worth seven grand, what the hell
would I need to ask the bank for?

33:51.203 --> 33:53.865
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

33:53.940 --> 33:55.464
Don't you understand, brother...

33:55.541 --> 33:58.203
that you's a spick... a beaner?

33:58.277 --> 34:01.144
I mean, ain't gonna be
no white shirt and tie for you.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.181
It takes it to get it.

34:03.249 --> 34:07.049
The man says, ''If you don't have it,
then you ain't gonna get it.''

34:07.119 --> 34:10.384
It ain't the man that steals
your future. It's your bitterness.

34:10.456 --> 34:13.857
Oh, I guess I'm just
a dumb ol' uptown nigger.

34:13.926 --> 34:16.621
I don't know nothin' about
whatjack here knows, right?

34:16.696 --> 34:20.188
- Right.
- Well, if that's the case...

34:20.266 --> 34:23.030
and jack is so smart,
then what's he doin' here?

34:24.704 --> 34:27.571
Hey, Voodoo, you got
something to say to me?

34:28.808 --> 34:32.039
I say you full of shit,jack.

34:32.777 --> 34:36.214
I say he'll beat your ass on any street,
any day of the week.

34:36.282 --> 34:39.877
Oh, yeah? Well, where did you hear this?
I wanna know how you knew that.

34:39.952 --> 34:43.409
Because your big mouth would
catch too much wind, that's why.

34:46.058 --> 34:47.992
All right, flyboy.

34:51.697 --> 34:53.324
Money talks...

34:55.134 --> 34:56.761
and bullshit walks.

34:57.803 --> 35:00.363
Check it out.
It's on the table, man.

35:00.439 --> 35:02.634
- Hey, I'll take some of that.
- Yeah!

35:04.844 --> 35:07.005
Hey, Voodoo, we down.

35:07.079 --> 35:09.707
- Hey, where you going,jack?
- Look, Hector.

35:10.483 --> 35:13.941
This is a job, okay? It's not a game.
I got deliveries to make.

35:14.020 --> 35:16.250
Hey, but the fellas,
they got the money down on you.

35:21.494 --> 35:25.362
I got a cheese sandwich and a coffee.
Give the change to Bernadette.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.668
Hey, watch it!

36:41.941 --> 36:43.875
Yo! One side!

36:54.620 --> 36:57.384
What's the matter with you? What are
you doing riding on the sidewalk?

36:57.456 --> 36:59.822
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you doing?

37:02.027 --> 37:04.291
Wait a second!
I gotta get this stuff picked up!

39:37.182 --> 39:39.207
I'm tellin' you,jack,
forget about it.

39:39.285 --> 39:41.378
You're messin' with something
you don't know nothin' about.

39:41.453 --> 39:46.015
All I'm sayin' is...
he could've avoided him.

39:46.091 --> 39:48.457
He could've. I was there.
He ran him down for nothin'.

39:48.527 --> 39:50.461
Not just for nothin'.

39:52.698 --> 39:56.134
Voodoo was known to carry product
for some people.

39:56.201 --> 39:59.796
- Yeah, to Gypsy.
- I don't know who.

40:01.674 --> 40:04.905
- He doesn't know who.
- The brothers know who.

40:04.977 --> 40:07.036
I don't wanna know who.

40:09.982 --> 40:13.975
Voodoo stepped into that meat grinder
because he wanted the fast money.

40:14.053 --> 40:15.884
He volunteered.

40:18.357 --> 40:20.825
just be happy
it wasn't a closer race...

40:21.660 --> 40:23.594
or there would've been
two funerals.

40:24.530 --> 40:25.861
Dig?

40:41.280 --> 40:42.542
Yeah, Quicksilver.

40:42.614 --> 40:46.072
Oh, yeah, sure.
She's still with us.

40:46.151 --> 40:50.485
Right. Uh-huh.
You got it. Terri.

40:50.556 --> 40:53.923
- What?
- Terri, you got a command performance.

40:53.993 --> 40:56.655
2829 Grand.

40:56.729 --> 40:59.562
- What's ''a command performance''?
- That means you did a good job.

40:59.631 --> 41:02.930
They asked for you by name.

41:36.201 --> 41:39.602
- Come here.
- I can't. I'm workin'.

41:39.671 --> 41:41.662
Yeah. 2829 Grand.

41:41.740 --> 41:43.833
- Yeah.
- That's me. Come here.

41:54.753 --> 41:56.414
You know where this is?

42:00.859 --> 42:02.850
You didn't look at the address.

42:04.897 --> 42:07.866
- 21 West Eighty-eighth Street.
- Know where that is?

42:07.933 --> 42:11.130
Yeah, it's off the park.
What do you need me for? You got a car.

42:11.203 --> 42:13.603
You wanna conduct an interview,
or do you wanna work?

42:14.907 --> 42:17.307
- I was just--
- Look, Terri.

42:17.376 --> 42:19.674
I'll find someone else.
Give it back.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.737
No, that's all right.
I'll do it. I'm sorry.

42:28.954 --> 42:31.548
I'll call you from time to time.

42:32.724 --> 42:35.454
I call... you come.

46:18.150 --> 46:20.084
Thank you, Maria.

46:21.687 --> 46:24.247
- So?
- So, it's all there.

46:25.023 --> 46:26.422
All right.

46:27.993 --> 46:31.258
Wait a minute.
You don't have the money yet.

46:32.030 --> 46:35.693
All you got there is
a neatly typed loan application.

46:35.767 --> 46:39.032
What I got here is a chance--
a chance at somethin' better.

46:40.138 --> 46:42.368
Yeah, we'll see.

46:42.441 --> 46:44.375
- Friday, huh?
- Yeah.

46:45.444 --> 46:47.571
jack, I'm telling you,
this is just the beginning.

46:48.613 --> 46:50.638
This cart is just number one.

46:50.716 --> 46:54.812
I'm gonna work hard,
I'm gonna watch the money.

46:54.886 --> 46:58.413
Pretty soon two,
then three, then four.

46:58.490 --> 47:00.219
Who knows? Five, six.

47:02.127 --> 47:04.493
You're gonna see ''Hector.''

47:05.964 --> 47:07.397
That's my dream.

47:10.302 --> 47:14.329
You know, Hector, sometimes things
don't work out the way you plan.

47:14.406 --> 47:17.341
I mean, they can backfire on you--

47:17.409 --> 47:19.639
knock you lower
than where you started.

47:19.711 --> 47:22.908
jack, when you come from around here,
ain't no place to go but up.

47:24.316 --> 47:27.410
jesus, man, you are
one optimistic Mexican.

47:43.635 --> 47:45.603
Listen, Hec...

47:45.670 --> 47:48.036
when you go to see
the loan officer on Friday...

47:48.106 --> 47:52.133
wear something nice,
like a suit.

47:55.514 --> 47:59.006
Dress like a winner... be a winner.

47:59.084 --> 48:00.847
Right.

48:14.199 --> 48:17.362
- Hi,jack.
- Hello, Pat. I got a pickup for Macy.

48:19.805 --> 48:21.067
Thank you.

48:32.818 --> 48:34.513
Uh-huh.

48:40.525 --> 48:43.551
Five, four, three, two, one.

49:06.284 --> 49:09.014
Hey, what the hell are you doin'?
Hey, you moron!

49:18.463 --> 49:21.023
- You okay? Let me see that.
- No sweat. I'm okay.

49:21.099 --> 49:22.623
Let me see it. Come on.

49:24.569 --> 49:26.036
Whoa.

49:26.104 --> 49:27.537
All right.

49:29.674 --> 49:34.077
Here, look. Put this around-- Yeah.
just hold it there, okay?

49:38.116 --> 49:40.584
- So, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

49:45.290 --> 49:47.918
- Who's gonna fix your bike?
- I'll take care of it.

49:47.993 --> 49:50.325
- You know how to reset a wheel?
- Yeah.

49:54.032 --> 49:57.763
- No.
- Don't have a bike, you don't work.

49:58.603 --> 50:01.197
You don't work, you don't get paid.
There's no workman's comp.

50:01.273 --> 50:04.709
I don't need a lecture.
I'll take care of it.

50:04.776 --> 50:07.904
Thank you very much.
I appreciate what you've done. Okay?

50:10.015 --> 50:12.381
What are you doin'?
I told you I'd take care of it.

50:12.450 --> 50:14.384
Come on, tough guy.

50:37.475 --> 50:41.707
- How come it's so empty in here?
- Less to miss.

50:54.359 --> 50:56.452
This is you, isn't it?

50:57.596 --> 51:00.394
Hector said you were some kind
of big head honcho once.

51:00.465 --> 51:03.491
- No one knew what you were.
- Is that what Hector said?

51:03.568 --> 51:06.833
Well, you know Hector.
He likes myths.

51:08.206 --> 51:10.299
What he doesn't find, he invents.

51:12.978 --> 51:14.411
Were you?

51:16.181 --> 51:18.479
- Was I what?
- Were you rich?

51:23.221 --> 51:25.246
You look like you were.

51:25.323 --> 51:28.315
Oh, yeah?
What does rich look like?

51:31.730 --> 51:34.221
Suntan at Christmastime.

51:34.299 --> 51:37.894
Yeah, always smiling 'cause
there's nothin' ever to worry about.

51:37.969 --> 51:41.871
You know, like on TV on those
commercials. They're always smiling.

51:44.843 --> 51:48.370
- What happened to all of it?
- To all of what?

51:48.446 --> 51:51.176
- To all that money.
- Nothing happened to it.

51:51.249 --> 51:53.342
The money's still there.
It just belongs to somebody else now.

51:57.589 --> 52:00.080
If I had it, I'd never lose it.
No way.

52:01.826 --> 52:03.259
You can lose anything in life.

52:05.397 --> 52:06.830
Well...

52:08.700 --> 52:11.225
there you go.

52:11.302 --> 52:12.735
Thanks.

52:15.340 --> 52:19.606
- So, you making any money?
- I'm doing all right.

52:19.678 --> 52:22.476
Yeah, well, the reason I ask is...

52:22.547 --> 52:25.141
being a messenger isn't
for everybody, you know.

52:25.216 --> 52:27.343
I'm doin' fine.

52:27.419 --> 52:28.852
Okay.

52:29.954 --> 52:32.252
It's just that...

52:32.323 --> 52:35.224
there are other jobs that'd be
a little easier on the bones--

52:35.293 --> 52:36.851
say, waitressing.

52:36.928 --> 52:40.091
I don't like waiting on people.
I don't like touching their food.

52:42.901 --> 52:47.167
Look, Terri.
Let me try to explain this, okay?

52:47.939 --> 52:50.908
There are people out there
who use messengers...

52:50.975 --> 52:54.376
to do their dirty work.

52:54.446 --> 52:57.745
You know? So, it's our ass
instead of theirs.

52:57.816 --> 53:02.753
- You know what I'm talkin' about?
- Yeah, I do. It's cool.

53:03.922 --> 53:05.822
Okay.

53:11.830 --> 53:14.094
What are you doin'?

53:14.165 --> 53:16.429
- I'm oiling my chain.
- Why?

53:17.502 --> 53:19.697
- Make it go faster.
- It does?

53:21.906 --> 53:24.704
- You livin' with your folks?
- No, I live with a friend of mine--

53:27.746 --> 53:29.179
a girlfriend of mine.

53:31.416 --> 53:34.442
- Your family here in the city?
- Yeah.

53:34.519 --> 53:38.478
No, actually, my parents like to travel.
They're in Vegas right now.

53:38.556 --> 53:43.823
- Oh, yeah? Vacation?
- No. They work there. They're singers.

53:45.196 --> 53:47.858
I don't know if you heard of'em.
They're pretty famous.

53:47.932 --> 53:52.699
They open for Frank Sinatra's act.
They're very close with Frank.

53:52.771 --> 53:54.466
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

53:54.539 --> 53:59.408
A lot of people don't know this, but
Frank is a profoundly religious man.

53:59.477 --> 54:01.536
I should know.
He's my godfather.

54:01.613 --> 54:04.776
Of course, I don't remember a lot
of him. I was a baby and everything.

54:04.849 --> 54:07.340
But he sends me birthday cards
and Christmas cards.

54:08.153 --> 54:09.711
He's a good man.

54:09.788 --> 54:13.224
I know a lot of famous people.
Let's see. Who do I know?

54:13.291 --> 54:16.988
Wayne Newton, Bobby Hackett--
they're all friends of my dad.

54:17.061 --> 54:18.995
Yeah, I think you mean
Buddy Hackett.

54:21.065 --> 54:25.559
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Buddy Hackett.
I get so confused sometimes.

54:25.637 --> 54:28.731
- Bobby, Buddy, you know.
- Yeah, yeah.

54:32.010 --> 54:35.571
- Don't they worry about you?
- No, they trust me.

54:35.647 --> 54:38.377
They know I'm okay.

54:39.384 --> 54:41.818
- How'd you do that?
- It's magic, you know?

54:41.886 --> 54:44.582
Unbelievable.
Ladies and gentlemen...

54:44.656 --> 54:48.820
for the first time ever,
a full 360--

54:51.029 --> 54:55.022
Hi, Rand.
Terri, this is my friend, Rand.

54:56.267 --> 54:58.633
- Rand, this is Terri.
- Hi.

55:02.307 --> 55:04.571
- Thanks.
- Okay.

55:07.645 --> 55:09.044
See ya later.

55:16.454 --> 55:18.922
How's it goin'?

55:18.990 --> 55:21.959
- So, now I'm your friend.
- What?

55:22.026 --> 55:24.995
That's what you said--
''This is my friend, Rand.''

55:27.498 --> 55:29.432
Gonna screw her?

55:30.969 --> 55:33.062
Tough day in dance city?

55:45.650 --> 55:47.845
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

55:47.919 --> 55:50.615
I use my lock
on my rear wheel, you know?

55:50.688 --> 55:54.146
Listen,jack, you're always workin'
on that bike. Have a look at it.

55:54.225 --> 55:57.626
- Quick release, huh?
- Right. Make things a lot easier on yourself.

55:59.898 --> 56:02.298
Yeah, well, it's nice.

56:13.745 --> 56:15.144
Oh, shit.

56:16.781 --> 56:18.043
Oh,jesus!

56:24.555 --> 56:27.217
just thought I'd come by
for you guys to wish me luck.

56:28.226 --> 56:30.524
Hey, Hector, are you gonna
audition for the Four Tops?

56:30.595 --> 56:33.826
- Hey, funny.
- Hey, Hec, what is this?

56:33.898 --> 56:36.799
- What are you doin'?
- What? What's the matter?

56:37.635 --> 56:40.502
- The tux. Why are you wearin' a tux?
- You told me to.

56:41.439 --> 56:44.806
No. I told you
to wear a tux?

56:44.876 --> 56:47.208
You said wear somethin' nice.
A suit, you said.

56:47.278 --> 56:50.338
- Yeah. A suit.
- So, I ain't got no suit.

56:51.683 --> 56:54.914
- So, buy one. Borrow one.
- From who? What money?

56:56.888 --> 57:00.517
Hey,jack, look, I blow 1 00 bucks
on a suit, and what do I got?

57:00.591 --> 57:04.083
I got a crummy suit that Pee-Wee Herman
wouldn't wear to his own funeral.

57:04.162 --> 57:08.622
But for 40 bucks, I got
the best tux Hernando had, man.

57:08.700 --> 57:11.225
- Hernando?
- Hernando.

57:11.302 --> 57:13.532
Go ahead, feel it.
Come on. Touch it.

57:13.604 --> 57:18.132
Feel the fabric. This is linen.
This is a 250 set of threads.

57:19.143 --> 57:21.441
- So many ruffles.
- Yeah.

57:25.450 --> 57:27.782
Did I screw up?
Did I do something wrong?

57:27.852 --> 57:30.343
No, no. Look--

57:31.622 --> 57:33.613
Say you came from
a wedding, okay?

57:33.691 --> 57:37.024
Say you came straight
from a wedding right to the bank.

57:37.095 --> 57:40.121
- Yeah, but I--
-just do it, okay?

57:40.198 --> 57:41.688
Okay.

57:45.470 --> 57:46.903
Hey, Hec.

57:50.408 --> 57:53.605
- Good luck.
- Yeah, knock 'em dead, Hector.

57:53.678 --> 57:55.168
Thanks,jack.

57:57.215 --> 57:58.705
Go get 'em.

58:01.586 --> 58:04.214
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Move!

58:05.223 --> 58:07.748
All right, you bastard.

58:09.027 --> 58:10.517
Okay.

58:12.130 --> 58:14.530
- Hi, Dad.
-jackie. Here you are.

58:14.599 --> 58:16.658
I thought maybe
you got held up.

58:16.734 --> 58:18.964
You came all the way
on that thing?

58:19.037 --> 58:21.028
Yeah. So, what's
the damage here?

58:21.105 --> 58:23.767
- What, all the way from the city?
- Yeah.

58:23.841 --> 58:26.002
Why didn't you call me up? I would've
gone and picked you up.

58:26.077 --> 58:27.635
It's all right.
I like to ride.

58:27.712 --> 58:29.703
So, the alternator shot, or what?

58:29.781 --> 58:32.682
Plymouths are a pain in the ass.
Everything is ass-backwards.

58:32.750 --> 58:35.583
- Here, let me give you a hand.
- You got grease on your hand now.

58:35.653 --> 58:38.121
- Right now.
- It's okay. It's all right.

58:39.424 --> 58:40.914
Dinner's ready.

58:41.926 --> 58:43.917
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi,jackie.

58:43.995 --> 58:45.792
Mar, we'll be in in a minute,
all right?

58:45.863 --> 58:47.854
Well,just don't make it too long.

58:58.042 --> 59:00.033
Where's the paper?

59:00.111 --> 59:02.443
It's right there on the chair.

59:11.422 --> 59:13.890
So, how do you like Notre Dame?

59:15.693 --> 59:17.183
I like Notre Dame.

59:21.099 --> 59:23.090
That's The Wall StreetJournal.

59:23.167 --> 59:26.898
- Yeah, I know what it is.
- So, don't you wanna look?

59:31.375 --> 59:33.673
- I gotta go.
- Where are you going?

59:33.744 --> 59:35.177
I don't wanna start anything.

59:35.246 --> 59:38.306
What am I supposed to do
to make you realize?

59:38.382 --> 59:39.815
There's nothin' to talk about.

59:39.884 --> 59:43.251
The hell there isn't anything to talk ab
There's something to talk about.

59:43.321 --> 59:45.084
I'm your father.
I say there is, damn it.

59:45.156 --> 59:47.818
Okay? You wanna talk?
Let's talk, huh?

59:47.892 --> 59:50.725
Let's talk about you workin'
a double shift at the garage.

59:50.795 --> 59:53.662
Let's talk about you fixin'
these junk cars...

59:53.731 --> 59:55.562
in the yard on weekends.

59:55.633 --> 59:58.500
Let's talk about you and Mom not being
able to take a vacation.

59:58.569 --> 01:00:00.560
- You wanna talk.
- That's not the issue.

01:00:00.638 --> 01:00:03.072
We are talking
about your future.

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:05.769
You are smart.
You have brains.

01:00:05.843 --> 01:00:08.038
You're throwin' it away
on that goddamn bicycle.

01:00:08.112 --> 01:00:12.139
What about your future, Dad?
Huh? You and Mom.

01:00:17.622 --> 01:00:19.283
What--

01:00:19.357 --> 01:00:22.793
Mar, what am I supposed to do to get
through to that thick skull of his?

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.624
What? just tell me. Please.

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:35.598
- You remember that day, Dad?
- What day?

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:38.733
I said to you, ''Dad, I lost it all.''

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:40.606
Why are we bringing this up?

01:00:40.678 --> 01:00:44.444
You know what he says to me? He says,
''We Caseys, we can take a punch.''

01:00:44.515 --> 01:00:46.415
That's right. We can.
We can take a punch.

01:00:46.484 --> 01:00:48.475
And then you wanted
to make me a sandwich!

01:00:50.288 --> 01:00:54.952
I tell you I've lost everything you and Mom
have, and you're worried if I'm hungry or not.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.431
You know, I went out
to the cab and--

01:01:13.344 --> 01:01:15.335
I thought about what you said.

01:01:17.615 --> 01:01:19.606
And I guess I really--

01:01:20.918 --> 01:01:22.909
I really wanted to believe it.

01:01:27.358 --> 01:01:29.349
You didn't hear me
come back in, did you?

01:01:34.999 --> 01:01:37.024
You were sitting right there,
all slumped over.

01:01:42.006 --> 01:01:43.997
And you know,
in my whole life...

01:01:45.042 --> 01:01:48.307
I never saw you cry,
not once, until that day.

01:01:52.416 --> 01:01:54.441
I gotta go finish
Sweeney's car.

01:01:57.288 --> 01:01:59.279
I don't understand you, Son.

01:01:59.357 --> 01:02:01.450
You make me so damn mad.

01:02:13.137 --> 01:02:15.970
You ever try
eatin' one of these things?

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.567
- They're terrible.
- You wanna try another bank?

01:02:21.579 --> 01:02:24.207
Wouldn't do no good.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:25.544
Would it?

01:02:32.023 --> 01:02:34.116
You know, I've been on both sides.

01:02:34.191 --> 01:02:36.182
Being a messenger
is not so bad.

01:02:37.995 --> 01:02:41.021
I ain't going back
to riding no bike,jack.

01:02:45.369 --> 01:02:48.930
Hey, and besides, we have
our own lending institutions...

01:02:49.006 --> 01:02:50.940
here in the neighborhood.

01:02:54.478 --> 01:02:57.606
They'll bleed you. That's crazy, man.
They break peoples' legs.

01:02:57.682 --> 01:02:59.877
You been watchin'
too many movies.

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:02.748
They don't do that no more.

01:03:05.189 --> 01:03:06.679
Not all the time.

01:03:10.361 --> 01:03:12.454
I gotta get outta here.
I gotta return this monkey suit...

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:15.294
or else they're gonna
stick me for another day.

01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:42.481
Thank you.

01:03:51.168 --> 01:03:52.760
Excuse me.

01:03:57.007 --> 01:03:59.635
- Hi. You dressed up.
- Yeah. I'm glad you came.

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:01.268
Yeah, can we go now?

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:05.307
- Hello.
- You look beautiful.

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:07.647
Thank you.
Hi, sweetie.

01:04:07.718 --> 01:04:09.845
Ax and Rolf, this is jack Casey.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.184
- Hi.
-jack is a stockbroker.

01:04:12.256 --> 01:04:14.087
- Really?
- I was--

01:04:14.158 --> 01:04:16.149
A very successful stockbroker.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:18.195
I peeked at your clippings.

01:04:18.262 --> 01:04:20.822
Clippings. My God, a celebrity.

01:04:20.898 --> 01:04:22.957
In three years on the floor...

01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:25.024
jack grossed $30 million.

01:04:25.102 --> 01:04:26.933
My, my.

01:04:27.004 --> 01:04:29.165
It was some kind of record,
wasn't it,jack?

01:04:30.474 --> 01:04:32.738
Yeah, yeah.
I set another record.

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:35.677
I lost it all in 2 4 hours--
right down the toilet.

01:04:35.746 --> 01:04:37.236
Excuse me.

01:04:41.218 --> 01:04:42.708
Was it something I said?

01:04:46.223 --> 01:04:48.214
You guys go ahead.
Go on.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:53.420
I want you to come with us.

01:04:54.632 --> 01:04:57.795
Come on. I want you
to be their friend too.

01:04:57.868 --> 01:04:59.392
- Come with us.
- I can't leave it.

01:05:00.171 --> 01:05:02.366
- Leave it.
- It'll get ripped off.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.204
I need my bike.
I'm a bicycle messenger.

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:10.304
- It's just a job-- a job for kids.
- It's my life.

01:05:12.049 --> 01:05:13.482
It's a waste of a life.

01:05:19.924 --> 01:05:21.186
Leave it.

01:05:22.893 --> 01:05:24.326
I don't want to.

01:05:27.832 --> 01:05:29.322
All right.

01:06:03.601 --> 01:06:05.865
Oh, shit.

01:06:09.573 --> 01:06:11.564
- Hey.
- Hey, what's doin',jack?

01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:23.813
I forgot--

01:06:24.955 --> 01:06:26.946
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

01:06:36.967 --> 01:06:38.992
That'll do it for you?

01:06:50.047 --> 01:06:52.072
Man, things just don't
work that way.

01:07:02.326 --> 01:07:05.386
Look. Even here
they check references.

01:07:07.364 --> 01:07:10.765
Look, Hector...
I been thinkin'...

01:07:10.834 --> 01:07:13.598
and, you know--

01:07:13.671 --> 01:07:16.504
What'd you say?

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:18.565
You don't need him.

01:07:18.642 --> 01:07:21.372
jack, come on.
What are you talkin' about?

01:07:21.445 --> 01:07:25.108
I've been noticing a trend
in the market, in the stock market...

01:07:25.182 --> 01:07:27.173
and I see some leverage.

01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:29.242
- I was a trader.
- Yeah, and?

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.255
I was one of the best, and...

01:07:32.323 --> 01:07:34.314
I could take your money in
for you.

01:07:36.527 --> 01:07:38.757
And we could lose, huh?

01:07:39.997 --> 01:07:43.160
- We could, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

01:07:44.034 --> 01:07:45.524
Hey.

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.173
But we could win, too, huh?

01:07:52.009 --> 01:07:54.068
- Right?
- Yeah, we could.

01:07:55.412 --> 01:07:57.403
All right.

01:08:10.394 --> 01:08:11.827
We could win.

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:26.633
jesus Christ.

01:09:00.611 --> 01:09:02.044
I dropped my stuff.

01:09:03.947 --> 01:09:06.040
What are you doin' here?

01:09:06.116 --> 01:09:08.948
Could you help me out?
I would've called you, but--

01:09:09.019 --> 01:09:11.749
- I don't have a phone.
- You're right.

01:09:13.457 --> 01:09:14.890
No, I don't need that.

01:09:19.395 --> 01:09:22.296
I need a place to crash tonight, and
it's just gonna be for tonight.

01:09:22.366 --> 01:09:26.131
I don't wanna make any waves
between you and your girlfriend.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:29.171
I noticed you had a big place, and I was
just gonna take a space in the corner.

01:09:29.238 --> 01:09:32.402
I'll be out before you wake up
in the morning, I promise.

01:09:32.475 --> 01:09:35.774
I got kicked out of my girlfriend's
apartment, so I thought that--

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.151
I guess you can sleep
on the couch.

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:28.621
There's some blankets in the chest.

01:10:28.699 --> 01:10:30.894
That's okay.
I brought my sleeping bag.

01:10:48.152 --> 01:10:49.585
Where's your girlfriend?

01:11:20.017 --> 01:11:22.008
There's a pay phone on the corner.

01:11:22.085 --> 01:11:24.918
Why don't you go downstairs
and call your mother and father?

01:11:24.988 --> 01:11:28.287
- What?
- Vegas. Isn't that where you said they were?

01:11:30.928 --> 01:11:32.520
I don't wanna bother them.

01:11:33.997 --> 01:11:37.194
No, wait. I'm sure,
if you called them, you know...

01:11:37.267 --> 01:11:39.258
told them you were in a jam,
they'd help you out.

01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:41.327
Parents are like that.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.431
- So?
- So, what?

01:11:45.509 --> 01:11:48.069
So, are you going
to call them?

01:11:48.145 --> 01:11:50.613
I told you, they're busy.

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:52.444
Oh, yeah.

01:11:52.516 --> 01:11:55.576
Yeah, yeah. They're busy in Vegas
singing with Frank.

01:11:55.652 --> 01:11:57.415
Right.

01:11:59.456 --> 01:12:01.424
They're not in Vegas,
are they, Terri?

01:12:01.491 --> 01:12:03.356
Who are you, Dick Tracy?

01:12:03.427 --> 01:12:06.362
If you don't want me to stay here,
just say so. I got other friends.

01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:08.990
Cut the bullshit,
would you, Terri?

01:12:09.066 --> 01:12:10.966
I mean--

01:12:11.034 --> 01:12:13.093
You tell Hector
that you're from Chicago...

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:16.333
your father is some kind of
a jet pilot war hero.

01:12:16.406 --> 01:12:20.137
Then you turn around and tell me they're
singin' in Vegas with Frank Sinatra?

01:12:20.978 --> 01:12:23.845
So, what is it with you?
Why did you lie to me?

01:12:23.914 --> 01:12:27.008
What about you, huh? What are you,
some big man stockbroker...

01:12:27.084 --> 01:12:29.075
with millions of dollars
on Wall Street...

01:12:29.152 --> 01:12:33.919
and pictures of expensive vacations
and fancy girlfriends, huh?

01:12:33.991 --> 01:12:36.016
Or is itjack
the bicycle messenger...

01:12:36.093 --> 01:12:39.756
living in some warehouse
like a stray cat?

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:41.764
What about that one, huh?

01:12:41.832 --> 01:12:44.027
You don't know what you're talkin' about
so do me a favor.

01:12:44.101 --> 01:12:46.092
Go downstairs,
call up mommy and daddy...

01:12:46.169 --> 01:12:48.831
and go back to wherever it is
you ran away from, all right?

01:13:00.884 --> 01:13:03.819
I wish that I could, but...

01:13:03.887 --> 01:13:06.355
there isn't gonna be anyone there
to take the call.

01:13:12.496 --> 01:13:16.455
You're supposed to have all these brains.
You're supposed to be really smart.

01:13:16.533 --> 01:13:18.023
You're dumb.

01:13:18.101 --> 01:13:21.195
You see, you have all these choices
that you can make.

01:13:22.906 --> 01:13:24.897
I don't have any choices.

01:13:27.577 --> 01:13:29.568
I'm sorry that I bothered you.

01:13:40.223 --> 01:13:42.783
Hey. Where you goin', hothead? Huh?

01:13:46.129 --> 01:13:47.619
Look--

01:13:49.099 --> 01:13:51.090
I thought you needed
a place to stay.

01:13:55.906 --> 01:13:58.204
So, stay, all right?

01:13:59.876 --> 01:14:01.867
I want you to stay.

01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:07.806
Okay?

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.010
Okay.

01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:15.180
Come on.

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:38.397
Here. Watch my bike.

01:16:41.638 --> 01:16:42.935
Good luck.

01:17:16.373 --> 01:17:20.104
Hey, Dave. Look, could you
get Chip for me?

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:33.248
Mr. Casey, wonderful
to see you again.

01:17:33.323 --> 01:17:36.588
- Good to see you.
- It's been a long time, huh?

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:39.060
- What can I do for you?
- I need to get on the floor.

01:17:39.129 --> 01:17:41.996
- Can you help me out?
- Sure.

01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:15.489
So, what do you like today?

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:18.728
I'm gonna spread out, I guess,
try to build up some momentum.

01:18:18.802 --> 01:18:21.134
I'm lookin' for lightning to strike.

01:18:21.204 --> 01:18:23.729
You can make that happen,
Mr. Casey. I remember.

01:18:25.008 --> 01:18:27.306
Look, if it's okay, I'd like
to handle the phones for you.

01:18:27.377 --> 01:18:29.470
- Oh, thank you, Chip, but--
- Really. I'd like to.

01:18:29.546 --> 01:18:32.538
- Like old times, huh?
- Okay. Okay, thanks.

01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:44.117
Call Ds 45!

01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:49.296
Forty-fives at nine!

01:18:57.307 --> 01:18:58.899
I'm out.

01:19:04.414 --> 01:19:06.712
Ds-- 30, 3 5.

01:19:06.783 --> 01:19:09.149
I've got the March 40s
at three quarters.

01:19:09.219 --> 01:19:12.518
Buy! Buy! Buy!

01:19:27.671 --> 01:19:29.662
Twenty-five, thirty.

01:19:49.626 --> 01:19:52.356
Okay. Okay, mama.

01:19:55.098 --> 01:19:57.726
I gotta go. Bye-bye.

01:19:57.801 --> 01:19:59.792
Hey,jack, it's Maria.
They got her at the hospital.

01:19:59.869 --> 01:20:01.860
My mother, she's babblin'
I don't know what.

01:20:01.938 --> 01:20:04.270
I'm sorry. I gotta leave you
to do this alone.

01:20:05.608 --> 01:20:07.974
- Look, I'm havin' kind of a rough time.
- Hey.

01:20:08.044 --> 01:20:11.878
Hey, hey. What do you think--
boy or a girl?

01:20:23.226 --> 01:20:26.662
I need you to float me.
The market closes in three hours.

01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:28.595
For Chrissake,jack, let's not
jump before we look.

01:20:28.665 --> 01:20:30.895
The market's a mess.
It's like a gang war out there.

01:20:30.967 --> 01:20:32.958
Even Marcus is holding tight.

01:20:33.036 --> 01:20:36.028
- You said to me, ''If not now, when?''
- I know what I said!

01:20:37.841 --> 01:20:41.333
But not now. Besides, it'll take time
to put this together.

01:20:41.411 --> 01:20:42.901
Listen to me.

01:20:44.414 --> 01:20:48.851
I'm in it already. Okay?
I used up what I had.

01:20:48.918 --> 01:20:50.510
I'm down, but I'm not out.

01:20:52.722 --> 01:20:56.419
- Why didn't you come talk to me?
- I'm talkin' to you now.

01:21:00.864 --> 01:21:03.458
- I need 1 5 grand.
- Fifteen grand?

01:21:03.533 --> 01:21:06.593
What are you gonna do with 1 5 grand?
That's not money. That's nothin'.

01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:09.467
You wanna get back in,
let's do it right. Let's go for it.

01:21:09.539 --> 01:21:11.769
Back in business again, you and me.
We'll make a plan.

01:21:11.841 --> 01:21:14.309
But not this way,jack.

01:21:15.512 --> 01:21:18.538
I don't know
how I got here, okay?

01:21:18.615 --> 01:21:22.107
But I'm here, and this is it.
Right now. This is the time.

01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:28.382
This isn't about business,
is it?

01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:36.221
Okay.

01:21:36.299 --> 01:21:38.290
I guess I got 1 5 grand.

01:21:38.368 --> 01:21:42.168
I think you should know
I have nothing,just a feeling.

01:21:42.238 --> 01:21:44.399
What are you trying to do,
talk me out of it?

01:21:44.474 --> 01:21:46.942
Ceil, I want you
to put me on the floor.

01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:49.376
Open an account
forjack Casey.

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:52.643
Yeah, that's right--
''Smilin'''jack Casey.

01:21:58.488 --> 01:22:00.479
Raydon.

01:22:00.557 --> 01:22:03.390
Six and a quarter, up three-eighths.
29,000 traded.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.950
How about Bell Tech?

01:22:05.795 --> 01:22:08.696
Four and a half, up a half.
That's 40,000 traded.

01:22:08.765 --> 01:22:11.097
What do you smell?

01:22:11.167 --> 01:22:13.795
I like Zenon.

01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:17.397
Two and three quarters. Holding.
Only 1 5,000 traded.

01:22:18.341 --> 01:22:20.571
It's been weak all month,
and they're open down this morning.

01:22:20.643 --> 01:22:22.634
- It's a dog.
- Let's see.

01:22:24.547 --> 01:22:28.415
Zenon call Ds, 30s.
I'm a seller at two and three quarters.

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:30.783
- At three quarters.
- I'll buy five.

01:22:30.854 --> 01:22:32.253
- Sold!
- Sold!

01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:35.257
Take five,jack.
I'm out! I'm out!

01:22:41.831 --> 01:22:44.891
I'll sell the 30s in Zenon
at two and a half.

01:22:45.969 --> 01:22:48.961
- I'll buy 1 5.
- Sold!

01:22:49.739 --> 01:22:51.707
Why is he buying that junk?

01:22:59.782 --> 01:23:01.977
- I'm gonna sell 'em down to two.
- I'll buy 20.

01:23:45.361 --> 01:23:48.228
jack, I'm sorry, man,
but this is not the day.

01:23:48.298 --> 01:23:50.289
Get out. Take the loss
while you still got something.

01:23:50.366 --> 01:23:53.961
- I'm staying with it.
- It's down to one and a quarter.

01:23:54.037 --> 01:23:56.835
-jack, get out. It's a mistake.
- I'm stayin' with it!

01:24:00.376 --> 01:24:03.311
Get me out.
Out! Out! Out!

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.711
jack, it's up to two.

01:24:25.435 --> 01:24:29.667
- Two and a quarter.
- All right. Here we go.

01:24:29.739 --> 01:24:34.073
- Two and a half.
- That's right, baby. That's right.

01:24:34.143 --> 01:24:36.907
We got ten at a quarter.
Come on, come on.

01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:39.414
Buyers everywhere.
Bid for 1 ,000!

01:24:44.387 --> 01:24:47.879
- Two and three quarters,jack!
- Come on! Come on!

01:24:56.165 --> 01:24:58.156
- Three and a quarter!
- All right!

01:24:58.234 --> 01:25:01.032
Four bid on the 30s!

01:25:03.573 --> 01:25:06.838
-jack, it's up to four!
- Sell it. I'm out.

01:25:06.909 --> 01:25:09.104
What? It's on a roll.
Lightning is striking twice.

01:25:09.178 --> 01:25:11.169
It already has.
Sell it out at four.

01:25:11.247 --> 01:25:13.078
You got it.

01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:15.344
jesus! I was having such
a good time, I forgot to buy in.

01:25:25.328 --> 01:25:27.592
That leaves 38 grand
for you, pal.

01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:29.859
Listen, take a vacation.

01:25:29.932 --> 01:25:32.730
Go down to the islands.
Do some marlin fishing.

01:25:32.802 --> 01:25:34.793
And then you and me,
we gotta talk.

01:25:34.871 --> 01:25:37.066
So who should I make
this one out to?

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.801
- Him.
- My father.

01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:45.444
- I thought onlyjews did guilt.
- You do. We do shame.

01:25:53.723 --> 01:25:55.953
- Hey.
- Huh? Hey.

01:25:56.025 --> 01:25:58.016
- How's mama?
- Mama ain't mama yet, man.

01:25:58.094 --> 01:26:00.790
She's been in there
for, like, eight hours.

01:26:00.863 --> 01:26:02.854
Like, what time you got?

01:26:02.932 --> 01:26:05.799
Hector, there's a clock right there.
It's 9:00.

01:26:05.868 --> 01:26:07.859
- Come here. Come here.
- Hey, hey. It's okay.

01:26:07.937 --> 01:26:10.167
I know you did
your best in there.

01:26:11.908 --> 01:26:14.308
Why don't you just stick around
and wait for the baby?

01:26:15.144 --> 01:26:17.135
Open it.

01:26:20.316 --> 01:26:23.581
There's a $1 7 0 broker's fee.
I deducted it.

01:26:25.321 --> 01:26:29.155
- But I saw your face this morning, and you--
- I had a better second half.

01:26:30.626 --> 01:26:32.617
- Mr. Rodriquez?
- Yes?

01:26:32.695 --> 01:26:35.823
It's a boy.
Eight pounds, six ounces.

01:26:35.898 --> 01:26:37.525
It's a boy.
It's a boy!

01:26:41.170 --> 01:26:43.365
Wonderful!

01:26:43.439 --> 01:26:45.999
It's a beautiful boy.

01:27:02.191 --> 01:27:03.818
Come here.

01:27:22.345 --> 01:27:24.575
Hey, Terri.

01:27:24.647 --> 01:27:26.080
Not for nothin'...

01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:29.741
but what's it gonna cost you?

01:27:46.969 --> 01:27:48.561
Get in.

01:27:51.507 --> 01:27:55.204
- I ain't workin' for you no more.
- Whoa.

01:27:55.278 --> 01:27:57.872
I don't talk business
in the street.

01:27:57.947 --> 01:27:59.437
Get in.

01:28:10.359 --> 01:28:12.350
Wanna go to a little party?

01:28:12.428 --> 01:28:15.226
What do you mean, a party?
What kind of party?

01:28:19.035 --> 01:28:22.971
What do you care?
You'll get paid for your time.

01:28:25.541 --> 01:28:28.601
Let me out of the car.
Let me out of the goddamn car.

01:28:28.678 --> 01:28:32.273
Stop this goddamn car!
What the hell are you doing to me?

01:28:32.348 --> 01:28:34.213
Stop! Let me outta here!

01:28:34.283 --> 01:28:36.808
Let me out! Help!

01:28:36.886 --> 01:28:40.344
What... is this?

01:28:40.423 --> 01:28:44.052
I carried your shit for you,
and I don't see anything...

01:28:44.126 --> 01:28:46.219
but I'm no whore.

01:28:46.295 --> 01:28:48.286
Don't mess with me.

01:28:48.364 --> 01:28:50.161
Please.

01:28:50.233 --> 01:28:52.929
Don't mess with me.

01:28:53.002 --> 01:28:54.230
Don't.

01:30:24.293 --> 01:30:25.783
Okay.

01:30:26.762 --> 01:30:28.753
Okay, okay.

01:30:49.418 --> 01:30:51.716
Cool it. Cool it.

01:30:57.093 --> 01:30:58.890
It's okay. It's okay.

01:31:08.938 --> 01:31:10.929
You okay?

01:31:20.349 --> 01:31:23.841
You stay with us. We won't
let him get to you.

01:31:23.919 --> 01:31:26.945
I think Apache should tail him.
Keep an eye on him.

01:31:27.023 --> 01:31:29.014
What do you think, huh?

01:31:33.896 --> 01:31:35.386
Yeah.

01:31:49.011 --> 01:31:51.502
- He's comin', man.
- Good work, Apache.

01:32:44.467 --> 01:32:45.900
Gypsy!

01:32:45.968 --> 01:32:49.301
You don't mess
with her no more!

01:33:18.067 --> 01:33:20.763
Terri, no! Come back!
Get back here!

01:35:08.611 --> 01:35:10.772
What happened?
What happened to you?

01:35:10.846 --> 01:35:12.837
He had a gun,
and he shot Airborne.

01:35:12.915 --> 01:35:16.043
- Who shot Airborne?
- The Gypsy. He shot him.

01:35:16.118 --> 01:35:17.983
All right.

01:35:32.568 --> 01:35:36.937
Let's just get outta here.
I just wanna go away. Please? Okay?

01:35:37.006 --> 01:35:39.201
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to take the keys.

01:35:39.275 --> 01:35:42.642
I want you to go inside, lock the door
and don't let anybody in.

01:35:42.711 --> 01:35:45.578
You hear me?
Don't let anybody in.

01:35:45.648 --> 01:35:48.640
What are you gonna do?
Huh? What?

01:35:48.717 --> 01:35:51.379
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:35:51.453 --> 01:35:54.911
Maybe he'll follow me. Maybe I can
get him away from here.

01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:58.721
Look, you got to just stay here,
all right? just stay here.

01:36:00.863 --> 01:36:04.560
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I can walk.

01:37:06.295 --> 01:37:09.059
Come on! Come on!

01:41:53.482 --> 01:41:54.972
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:41:55.050 --> 01:41:58.019
- Boy, you look great.
- Thanks. How did it go?

01:41:58.086 --> 01:42:00.714
Great. I got a couple
of real good offers.

01:42:00.789 --> 01:42:02.723
Oh, great. That's good.

01:42:02.791 --> 01:42:05.089
- You wanna get something to eat?
- Yeah.

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.458
Okay. How'd it go for you?

01:42:07.529 --> 01:42:11.260
Well, I'm gonna be
a paramedic.

01:42:11.333 --> 01:42:14.268
Yeah, it's this trainee program.
It's for six months...

01:42:14.336 --> 01:42:17.362
and I get to learn how to save people,
and I drive an ambulance.

01:42:17.439 --> 01:42:18.929
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:42:19.007 --> 01:42:21.134
It sounds great. A paramedic.

01:42:21.209 --> 01:42:25.009
- You've had experience with accidents.
- I'm very serious about this.

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.014
- I think it sounds great.
- Yeah.

01:42:27.082 --> 01:42:29.778
So, what do you say--
pizza, Chinese? What?

01:42:29.851 --> 01:42:31.785
- Pizza. Definitely pizza.
- Yeah?

01:42:31.853 --> 01:42:33.980
'Cause I was thinkin'
that Chinese might be good.

01:42:34.056 --> 01:42:36.854
Yeah, well, I really
wanted pizza.

01:42:36.925 --> 01:42:39.655
- Okay, yeah. That sounds good.
- No, you want Chinese, we'll go for Chinese.

01:42:39.728 --> 01:42:41.787
- No, I like-- Pizza sounds good.
- No, I like Chinese food.

01:42:41.863 --> 01:42:45.799
- I just have a little allergy.
- Wait. I know the perfect place.
