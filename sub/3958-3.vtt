00:01.002 --> 00:05.822
I hate this place. There's Stacey Stringfellow's
gang. You're in with them and you're in.

00:05.913 --> 00:10.613
All right, little girl?
All right, therapy Liam?

00:10.687 --> 00:13.526
He's an evil genius.

00:13.527 --> 00:17.527
Rae Earl has a magic fanny!

00:23.127 --> 00:26.767
Dear Diary, sometimes you have
to make big decisions.

00:26.877 --> 00:29.036
Sometimes you have to make
difficult decisions.

00:29.037 --> 00:33.037
I had to break up with Finn
before we went any further,

00:33.437 --> 00:36.596
before breaking up would be so
painful that we wouldn't be able to be

00:36.597 --> 00:38.436
around each other any more.
Here's your jacket.

00:38.437 --> 00:40.396
What's going on?

00:40.397 --> 00:42.996
I just...

00:42.997 --> 00:46.196
I just want to be friends,
I don't want to go out.

00:46.197 --> 00:49.036
What do you mean? Since when?

00:49.037 --> 00:52.116
That's my decision. I'm sorry.

00:52.117 --> 00:56.117
No, Rae, what have I done?! Rae?!

There y'are.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.596
I don't know what I'm more upset
about.

01:18.597 --> 01:22.597
Having to give your Bowie back, or...

01:26.357 --> 01:28.836
That's a lie.

01:28.837 --> 01:32.837
I do know.

01:35.557 --> 01:39.557
Rae, I can't be friends with you
right now, I just can't.

01:40.877 --> 01:42.196
Look...

01:42.197 --> 01:46.197
It's my decision.

01:48.757 --> 01:50.731
I'm sorry.

02:28.434 --> 02:32.233
Monday, the 30th of September, 1996.

02:32.234 --> 02:36.234
You ever see those people at school
or college who are always deep in a book?

02:36.514 --> 02:40.433
It's not so much that they love reading,
it's because when you're on your own,

02:40.434 --> 02:43.393
it's too embarrassing
to sit and do nothing.

02:43.394 --> 02:47.394
You've got to look busy, like you don't
care that no-one wants to talk to you.

02:52.834 --> 02:56.753
The funny thing is that at college,
if your thing is looking sad

02:56.754 --> 03:00.754
and contracting hepatitis,
there's a place for you.

03:01.314 --> 03:04.793
If your thing is playing old
computer games and seeing who can be

03:04.794 --> 03:08.794
the first to complete Golden Axe 100
times, then there's a place for you.

03:11.914 --> 03:15.914
If your thing is being popular,
cool and getting attention off boys,

03:16.434 --> 03:18.833
there's a place for you.

03:18.834 --> 03:21.913
But I was now the crazy girl
who set the fire alarm off.

03:21.914 --> 03:25.914
So for me - and for a few others -
there was no place.

03:36.034 --> 03:39.073
The worst thing was that it
was my own fault

03:39.074 --> 03:40.833
I was alone. I had friends already,

03:40.834 --> 03:43.073
but I couldn't be around them
much at the moment.

03:43.074 --> 03:47.074
No matter how lonely I got,
I had to give him space.

03:49.474 --> 03:51.154
It was the least I could do.

03:54.874 --> 03:58.273
There was one thing that got me
through the day, though.

03:58.274 --> 03:59.473
Food.

03:59.474 --> 04:03.474
It may shock you to hear this,
but I love food.

04:06.194 --> 04:10.194
I love how melting cheese bubbles
and browns like yellow lava.

04:12.914 --> 04:16.153
I love having a fried egg
and saving the yolk until last,

04:16.154 --> 04:19.593
popping its golden bubble with the
corner of my toast.

04:19.594 --> 04:23.594
I love when chocolate cake is
so sticky that it gums up your mouth

04:24.434 --> 04:26.354
and crawls down your throat.

04:27.994 --> 04:31.994
And when I'm hungry, like right now,
I love it even more.

04:32.194 --> 04:36.194
But right here, right now, just
water.

04:39.434 --> 04:43.434
At college, there's only one place
you can go if you want some privacy.

04:46.674 --> 04:50.674
And for what I was doing,
I needed privacy.

05:06.714 --> 05:08.394
Oh, my God!

05:12.714 --> 05:16.633
Mum? Mum?

05:16.634 --> 05:20.634
Rae.

05:23.874 --> 05:27.874
What is going on?
I have joined the SPG, love.

05:27.914 --> 05:30.433
The Stamford Pregnancy Group.

05:30.434 --> 05:33.193
We just hang out, you know, discuss
pregnancy things.

05:33.194 --> 05:37.194
Right, so it's necessary for you to
pump your vaginas in the air, is it?

05:38.594 --> 05:42.594
Oi! Where are you going with those?

05:42.834 --> 05:46.834
If I can't smoke, you can't smoke.

05:48.074 --> 05:50.753
What are they doing here?

05:50.754 --> 05:53.873
They needed somewhere to
do their pelvic floor exercise class,

05:53.874 --> 05:57.874
so I suggested they come here.
Is that OK?

05:58.474 --> 05:59.514
POP!

06:00.714 --> 06:02.313
Yeah, that's fine with me.

06:02.314 --> 06:05.513
Since I'm being so cool about all
this,

06:05.514 --> 06:07.953
would it be all right if
you gave me 15 quid?

06:07.954 --> 06:09.913
No.

06:09.914 --> 06:11.913
But it's for an album

06:11.914 --> 06:13.073
that I really want... No.

06:13.074 --> 06:15.193
..by a band that I really...

06:15.194 --> 06:17.473
Do you speak English, Rae? No.

06:17.474 --> 06:21.113
Nein, non, negative, no.
Not gonna happen.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.794
I've just spent my last 25 quid
signing up to the SPG.

06:31.994 --> 06:34.393
Rae, please. I just want to say...
Archie,

06:34.394 --> 06:38.193
I don't want to speak to you.

06:38.194 --> 06:41.954
Here. I got you something.

06:45.354 --> 06:49.033
I can't believe you would
join in with those wankers.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.153
You're supposed to be my friend.

06:51.154 --> 06:54.073
Do you know how horrible it is to
have someone slag you off like that?

06:54.074 --> 06:56.313
Yeah, I know, I know.

06:56.314 --> 07:00.314
I can't be friends with someone
who's as much of a phoney as you are.

07:00.794 --> 07:03.953
Rae...

07:03.954 --> 07:06.193
It was getting to the stage
where I couldn't bear

07:06.194 --> 07:09.313
to be on my own any more.
That's the thing about loneliness.

07:09.314 --> 07:12.793
It creeps and it grows inside you
like a deep silence.

07:12.794 --> 07:14.353
I had to find someone.

07:14.354 --> 07:18.273
Maybe I could grab Chloe when she
wasn't around Finn and just hang out.

07:18.274 --> 07:22.274
But it looked like she had found
a place to fit in, too.

07:25.474 --> 07:27.754
Why couldn't I?

07:45.834 --> 07:48.313
Oh, here she is! Listen, Psycho.

07:48.314 --> 07:51.273
Oh, shit! I was wondering if you
could set the fire alarm off round
about half-two-ish?

07:51.274 --> 07:54.633
I've got a PE exam
I could do with avoiding.

07:54.634 --> 07:56.393
What's in the bag?

07:56.394 --> 07:59.393
Full of medication? No.

07:59.394 --> 08:01.473
Let us have a look, then.
No, please, don't.

08:01.474 --> 08:03.553
Why don't you just get
the fuck off her, Simmy?

08:03.554 --> 08:05.993
What? "What?"

08:05.994 --> 08:08.953
Oh, yeah, it's easy picking
on girls, innit?

08:08.954 --> 08:12.273
Yeah, I notice you don't pick on lads
any more, since you got your arse kicked

08:12.274 --> 08:13.833
by Dom Yeates' brother.

08:13.834 --> 08:15.913
Whatever, Stacey!
I'm only having a laugh!

08:15.914 --> 08:17.433
Well, it doesn't look like it!

08:17.434 --> 08:21.434
So, why don't you take your tiny penis
and your tiny testicles and piss off?

08:29.754 --> 08:31.153
You all right?

08:31.154 --> 08:34.273
Er... yeah, thanks.

08:34.274 --> 08:37.232
You're Chloe's mate, aren't you?

08:37.234 --> 08:41.234
Yeah.

08:42.234 --> 08:45.193
Have they said they don't mind me
hanging out with them? Yes.

08:45.194 --> 08:46.734
Will you stop asking me that?

08:48.314 --> 08:51.913
Don't be nervous, but you need to
get in with them, Rae. So that way,

08:51.914 --> 08:53.673
we can hang out more, too.

08:53.674 --> 08:56.353
Well, is there anything
I should know?

08:56.354 --> 08:58.473
Tell me a bit about them all.

08:58.474 --> 08:59.953
Right, OK, then.

08:59.954 --> 09:01.633
OK, imagine a ladder.

09:01.634 --> 09:05.634
At the bottom of the ladder
there's me, Chloe.

09:08.234 --> 09:12.234
I'm single, I enjoy Italian food,
tennis and singing in the shower.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.713
You're at the bottom of the ladder?

09:16.714 --> 09:19.554
Yeah, well, give me a chance, Rae.
I've only been in the gang a week.

09:20.594 --> 09:24.594
So next up... is Lois.

09:25.314 --> 09:28.073
Lois is very sweet,
she's just not the brightest.

09:28.074 --> 09:30.473
She says she's got this
secret boyfriend.

09:30.474 --> 09:31.913
No-one's ever seen him.

09:31.914 --> 09:35.914
There's a very strong possibility
that he's imaginary.

09:36.114 --> 09:37.593
Vicky, you've met before.

09:37.594 --> 09:39.713
She can be a bit of a bitch
if she doesn't know you.

09:39.714 --> 09:41.273
She's got this skin condition

09:41.274 --> 09:43.553
and she had a proper bad flare-up
a couple of days ago,

09:43.554 --> 09:46.153
so don't mention anything.

09:46.154 --> 09:49.593
Then there's Amy. She's quiet,
a little scary.

09:49.594 --> 09:53.594
And then of course, top of the
ladder, there's Stacey herself.

09:59.194 --> 10:03.194
She likes tarot cards,
dancing and the Backstreet Boys.

10:04.514 --> 10:07.193
Backstreet Boys?

10:07.194 --> 10:09.473
She's 16 years old.

10:09.474 --> 10:12.193
Come on then, let it all out of your
system before we get in there.

10:12.194 --> 10:15.513
Right. Backstreet Boys make me want
to scald my inner thighs

10:15.514 --> 10:18.233
with the hottest substance known to
man - strawberry jam Pop-Tarts.

10:18.234 --> 10:20.713
They make me want to spend months
learning how to drive,

10:20.714 --> 10:23.993
then years of working hard, saving
up all my money so I can buy a Land Rover

10:23.994 --> 10:25.233
and run them all down.

10:25.234 --> 10:28.633
They are everything that is
wrong with the world.

10:28.634 --> 10:32.313
They are destroying music.

10:32.314 --> 10:35.153
Are you done?

10:35.154 --> 10:37.433
Yeah.

10:37.434 --> 10:41.313
One last thing. Don't mention
to Vicky that Lois

10:41.314 --> 10:44.753
talked to her ex-boyfriend's brother
Paul at Tina Mocock's party back in March

10:44.754 --> 10:46.513
when Stacey specifically
asked her not to...

10:46.514 --> 10:47.793
..cos she
knew he had this weird crush

10:47.794 --> 10:49.513
on her sister Yasmina who's got
issues.

10:49.514 --> 10:53.514
She doesn't want Vicky getting all
hysterical. Have you got that, Rae?

10:56.514 --> 10:59.867
Rae? Let's do this.

11:19.403 --> 11:20.442
So, Rae!

11:20.443 --> 11:22.922
What kind of stuff are you into?

11:22.923 --> 11:26.242
Oh, I don't know, erm...

11:26.243 --> 11:30.243
arguing with my mum,
drinking cider...

11:30.803 --> 11:32.602
Oh! Music.

11:32.603 --> 11:36.162
We talk more about fashion,
don't we? But we all like music.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.442
Like Lois cried when she found
out that Tupac died.

11:39.443 --> 11:40.802
Didn't you, Lois?

11:40.803 --> 11:44.803
But I'm the only one who really listens to,
like, a wide variety of music, really.

11:45.603 --> 11:47.443
What do you think
of the Backstreet Boys?

11:50.723 --> 11:52.762
I've never really heard
any of their stuff.

11:52.763 --> 11:54.682
You've never heard Backstreet Boys?!

11:54.683 --> 11:56.842
No.

11:56.843 --> 11:57.922
That's unbelievable!

11:57.923 --> 12:00.522
So, what fashion are you into?

12:00.523 --> 12:02.402
Just whatever. Labels?

12:02.403 --> 12:05.282
Yep.

12:05.283 --> 12:06.882
It's all about Morton at the moment.

12:06.883 --> 12:10.122
Oh, it's all Morton. I love Morton.

12:10.123 --> 12:14.123
So, erm... why aren't you wearing
any labels today?

12:17.923 --> 12:20.722
Lois, how are things going
with your mystery boyfriend?

12:20.723 --> 12:23.402
We spent last night kissing.

12:23.403 --> 12:26.802
He's quite shy, so I guess I don't
want to rush him. Anyway,

12:26.803 --> 12:29.562
I think I'm really falling for him.

12:29.563 --> 12:31.643
Don't commit to anything
until you've seen his penis.

12:32.523 --> 12:35.002
Trust me.

12:35.003 --> 12:36.522
Chloe, did you get that bottle
of water I asked you for?

12:36.523 --> 12:39.962
Yeah, yeah, I did, actually.

12:39.963 --> 12:42.242
There you go. Thanks.

12:42.243 --> 12:45.403
Oh... oh, it's not sparkling.

12:46.923 --> 12:48.522
Sorry.

12:48.523 --> 12:52.523
It's all right. Never mind.

12:54.283 --> 12:58.283
Oh! Before I forget, I've got my
invites for my birthday on Saturday.

12:58.923 --> 13:02.602
Amy, Lois,

13:02.603 --> 13:05.882
Vicks and Chlo.

13:05.883 --> 13:09.883
Now, I haven't decided on a venue
yet, so I ask that you all remain patient.

13:11.483 --> 13:13.442
Right, let's bounce, bitches.

13:13.443 --> 13:14.883
See you later, Rae.

13:18.003 --> 13:22.003
I needed a fresh approach, or I was
going to be a loner for ever.

13:23.843 --> 13:27.843
Maybe I was wrong about the reason
loners read so much at college.

13:28.163 --> 13:30.762
Maybe they actually want to escape
reality for a while,

13:30.763 --> 13:33.363
disappear into a different world.

13:35.363 --> 13:38.562
Agh!

13:38.563 --> 13:42.563
That's for my brother, you pig!

13:48.563 --> 13:52.563
Oi, oi!

13:52.763 --> 13:54.962
Ah, The Tempest.

13:54.963 --> 13:56.642
It's crap, isn't it? Is it?

13:56.643 --> 13:59.202
I like Caliban.

13:59.203 --> 14:01.042
He's a freak.

14:01.043 --> 14:05.043
An outsider, but deep down,
he's very poetic.

14:06.563 --> 14:07.762
Remind you of anyone?

14:07.763 --> 14:11.763
Ah!

14:12.323 --> 14:15.842
Did I see you hanging around with
Amy Malone earlier?

14:15.843 --> 14:16.882
Not really.

14:16.883 --> 14:19.562
Is she single?

14:19.563 --> 14:21.162
I don't know.

14:21.163 --> 14:23.202
Find out for me.

14:23.203 --> 14:26.242
She's got amazing calves.
I love calves.

14:26.243 --> 14:30.242
Good for you.
It's nice to have an interest.

14:30.243 --> 14:32.362
Where's your lunch?
Oh, I'm not hungry.

14:32.363 --> 14:36.363
Have one of my hot dogs.
I've already eaten.

14:37.083 --> 14:39.082
I thought you said you're not hungry?

14:39.083 --> 14:43.083
I'm not hungry,
because I've already eaten.

14:46.203 --> 14:50.203
You can't eat in front of people,
can you?

14:53.163 --> 14:54.203
What?

14:55.723 --> 14:59.002
Why would I not be
able to eat in front of people?

14:59.003 --> 15:00.682
I can eat in front of people.

15:00.683 --> 15:03.642
So...

15:03.643 --> 15:07.643
..eat.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.042
I don't have to prove anything
to you.

15:12.043 --> 15:15.002
Don't get annoyed with me,
just because I'm right.

15:15.003 --> 15:18.082
You're not right.
And I'm not annoyed.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.843
You look annoyed. Yeah,
that's because you're annoying.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.562
There is one place at college you
can go for a bit of privacy,

15:26.563 --> 15:30.563
because Liam was right.
Outside of hospital, I've not eaten

15:30.643 --> 15:33.802
in front of another human being
for eight years.

15:33.803 --> 15:36.643
Well, except my mum -
but she's not really human.

15:44.723 --> 15:47.562
It makes being at college even
more difficult,

15:47.563 --> 15:51.563
but I guess it is one bonus
of being alone all the time.

15:58.163 --> 16:01.802
Oh, what the hell?

16:01.803 --> 16:04.682
Rae! Jesus!

16:04.683 --> 16:07.762
Sorry, did I scare you?!

16:07.763 --> 16:08.842
What's going on?

16:08.843 --> 16:11.322
I'm just sorting out a jumble sale
for the SPG.

16:11.323 --> 16:15.323
No-one else had any space,
so I volunteered our house.

16:16.123 --> 16:17.842
It smells like dead bodies.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.762
Yeah, well, there's a strong chance
that people have died

16:20.763 --> 16:22.282
wearing some of these clothes.

16:22.283 --> 16:26.042
I'd definitely stay away
from the pyjamas, anyway.

16:26.043 --> 16:30.043
Mum? Have you thought any
more about that Â£15?

16:31.003 --> 16:35.003
Yeah. I've thought about how much
there's no chance I'm giving it to you.

16:40.683 --> 16:44.683
If I had any chance of getting in with
the girls, I had to do some research.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.642
Archie, I told you... Rae.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.642
# Didn't mean to make you sad

17:00.643 --> 17:04.041
# Didn't mean to make you cry

17:04.042 --> 17:06.402
# Didn't mean to let you down

17:06.403 --> 17:08.202
# Dark without you by my side

17:08.203 --> 17:11.321
# In the shadows
In the night

17:11.323 --> 17:13.482
# Dark without your shining light

17:13.483 --> 17:17.483
# My Rae of sunshine shining bright

17:18.843 --> 17:22.843
# My Rae makes everything all right

17:24.083 --> 17:26.521
# I'm sorry that I made you sad

17:26.522 --> 17:29.122
# Sorry that I made you cry

17:29.123 --> 17:31.202
# I'm sorry that I let you down

17:31.203 --> 17:33.282
# I want you back here by my side

17:33.283 --> 17:37.283
# My Rae of sunshine shining bright

17:38.483 --> 17:42.483
# My Rae makes everything
all right. #

17:49.563 --> 17:52.402
Bravo! Very good, Archie.

17:52.403 --> 17:56.403
Thank you, Mrs Bouchtat, Mr Bouchtat.

17:57.883 --> 17:59.002
I'm so sorry.

17:59.003 --> 18:01.322
I've been trying to think of ways
that I could make it up to you.

18:01.323 --> 18:05.323
Archie, you can make it up to me
by not being so fake any more.

18:07.243 --> 18:11.002
Because I can't be mates with
someone who's like that.

18:11.003 --> 18:14.122
Just be yourself.

18:14.123 --> 18:16.482
Can you do that?

18:16.483 --> 18:19.562
Yeah.

18:19.563 --> 18:21.322
Promise me.

18:21.323 --> 18:25.323
Promise.

18:52.603 --> 18:54.522
Rae, come here.

18:54.523 --> 18:57.922
We're all just talking about what
we're going to do for Stacey's birthday.

18:57.923 --> 19:00.202
Yeah, you know, bowling's fine,
but the shoes are gross.

19:00.203 --> 19:01.562
But they spray them.

19:01.563 --> 19:05.563
The spray smells worse than the
actual... Rae, is that a Morton top?

19:07.163 --> 19:11.163
This? Is it?

19:12.043 --> 19:14.842
Oh, yeah. Where d'you get it from?

19:14.843 --> 19:17.082
Morton. How much was it?

19:17.083 --> 19:18.922
I didn't want to look.
You know what it's like.

19:18.923 --> 19:20.843
Just close my eyes,
hand over the money.

19:22.963 --> 19:25.642
Rae, we're all going to go over
to mine tonight.

19:25.643 --> 19:29.643
Fancy it?
Yeah. I could get down with that.

19:33.243 --> 19:36.242
Dear Diary, I am officially a girl.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.722
I mean, yeah, I'm not denying the
existence of my vagina

19:38.723 --> 19:42.723
for the past 16 years, but this was
it. Talking about hair, clothes, boys,

19:44.163 --> 19:48.163
what products to use to make
your skin soft, I felt like I was involved

19:48.283 --> 19:52.283
in something that was making me feel
feminine for the first time in my life.

19:52.963 --> 19:54.042
So, where's Vicky?

19:54.043 --> 19:55.882
She's at the opticians.

19:55.883 --> 19:58.922
That's not true, Lois.
She told me not to say.

19:58.923 --> 20:01.962
Look, she's at a specialist
about her skin.

20:01.963 --> 20:03.802
D'you know, it's gotten so
bad recently.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.282
She should just use some cream or
something, like...

20:06.283 --> 20:07.802
something with steroids in it.

20:07.803 --> 20:09.842
I think she uses something already...

20:09.843 --> 20:13.042
Yeah, well she should stop using
so much foundation, too.

20:13.043 --> 20:17.043
I know she wants to hide her skin,
but it doesn't. And it makes it worse.

20:17.363 --> 20:20.643
Pretty soon, she's going to be
putting it on with a trowel.

20:22.443 --> 20:24.682
Oh, someone should say something.

20:24.683 --> 20:28.683
Tell us about your love life, Rae.
Who are you seeing at the moment?

20:33.723 --> 20:36.442
Oh, cool, the Chinese is here.
Will you go and get it?

20:36.443 --> 20:37.602
Is it my turn?

20:37.603 --> 20:39.802
I don't know, we don't do turns,
silly!

20:39.803 --> 20:42.242
Oh, all right, then.

20:42.243 --> 20:46.243
And will you pay for mine as well?
I'll give you the cash back at college.

20:49.443 --> 20:53.443
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

20:54.483 --> 20:58.483
Oh, by the way,
Rae's just broke up with Finn Nelson.

20:59.643 --> 21:01.442
You broke up with him?

21:01.443 --> 21:03.762
You broke up with Finn Nelson? Yeah.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.922
Is it true you got caught doing
stuff in the toilets?

21:05.923 --> 21:07.362
No.

21:07.363 --> 21:10.602
Why did you break up with him?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.562
Well, I just wanted to be friends.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.722
That's so cool, Rae.

21:14.723 --> 21:17.322
Stacey went out with Finn, too,
but he broke up with her.

21:17.323 --> 21:21.042
Yeah, only because he found out
I was going to finish with him.

21:21.043 --> 21:22.842
That is the only reason.

21:22.843 --> 21:25.402
Oh, look who came free with the
Chinese!

21:25.403 --> 21:27.242
Oh, hi, Vicks. Hiya.

21:27.243 --> 21:29.482
Hi. How was the opticians?

21:29.483 --> 21:32.762
Er, good, yeah. I don't need to wear
glasses so, er, that's cool.

21:32.763 --> 21:35.682
Oh, that is cool.

21:35.683 --> 21:38.082
So, what tests did you do?

21:38.083 --> 21:42.083
Erm, just standard eye tests.
The letter one.

21:42.163 --> 21:44.483
Oh, yeah, I know the letter one.

21:48.203 --> 21:50.602
Help yourself, Rae, there's tons.

21:50.603 --> 21:54.603
Oh, erm...

21:54.683 --> 21:56.282
..no.

21:56.283 --> 22:00.283
Seriously. You don't have to be
so polite.

22:01.843 --> 22:05.682
No, I'm not. Erm...

22:05.683 --> 22:07.522
..I'm allergic to soy.

22:07.523 --> 22:11.523
So, er, what have I missed, anyway?
Not much.

22:12.363 --> 22:13.802
Oh, Rae got a cool Morton top.

22:13.803 --> 22:17.803
What? Yeah.

22:18.083 --> 22:21.562
No. No. That isn't.

22:21.563 --> 22:24.242
Oh...

22:24.243 --> 22:25.802
it's fake.

22:25.803 --> 22:28.082
Oh, my God! What?!

22:28.083 --> 22:30.442
Hang on a minute, maybe it's just
a... you know,

22:30.443 --> 22:32.202
a label you've never seen before.

22:32.203 --> 22:35.602
No, look. It says Mooton!

22:35.603 --> 22:38.682
It does, it says Mooton!

22:38.683 --> 22:40.762
I thought you bought it, Rae.

22:40.763 --> 22:43.002
Yeah, I did buy it. Where from?

22:43.003 --> 22:47.003
The Asian guy on the market that
sells Adididas trainers?

22:51.963 --> 22:55.963
I'm, erm... I'm just going to go
to the toilet.

22:58.883 --> 23:02.883
Don't cry. Just don't cry.

23:03.163 --> 23:07.163
Don't cry.

23:09.563 --> 23:13.563
Rae? It's Stace. Can I come in?

23:23.923 --> 23:25.722
Rae.

23:25.723 --> 23:29.723
You do know it was your label we
were laughing at, don't you? It's not you.

23:32.283 --> 23:34.362
Mooton.

23:34.363 --> 23:38.363
That is pretty funny.

23:38.843 --> 23:42.442
Look. I have something for you.

23:42.443 --> 23:46.443
It's an invite to my birthday on
Saturday.

23:46.881 --> 23:49.562
It's been really cool getting to
know you these past couple of days,

23:49.563 --> 23:53.563
so it'd mean a lot to me
if you were there.

23:55.243 --> 23:56.727
Great!

24:13.383 --> 24:17.383
Thursday, the 3rd of October, 1996.

24:28.455 --> 24:32.455
Did I mention how much I loved
hanging around with the girlies?

24:35.015 --> 24:38.614
Oh, Chloe, will you go and get me
some crisps out the vending machine?

24:38.615 --> 24:40.814
Cos I feel like I'm going to be
really hungry later on.

24:40.815 --> 24:44.815
Yeah.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.654
I need to talk to you
guys about something.

24:47.655 --> 24:49.894
I was with my boyfriend last night.
Did you shag him?

24:49.895 --> 24:53.895
No, we just kissed again.

24:54.735 --> 24:58.334
I want him to grab me a little,
touch me a bit.

24:58.335 --> 25:00.894
Do you know what I mean?
You want him to finger you.

25:00.895 --> 25:02.974
Oh!

25:02.975 --> 25:06.094
Is that too much to ask?
Do you think it's me?

25:06.095 --> 25:08.014
Do you think he just doesn't
fancy me?

25:08.015 --> 25:11.694
Lois, you're so good looking.

25:11.695 --> 25:15.695
Just give him some time. Like
you said, he might be quite shy.

25:16.495 --> 25:20.495
Yeah, maybe. Aw, thanks, Rae.

25:21.775 --> 25:23.134
I'll see you guys later.

25:23.135 --> 25:27.135
Bye. See you.

25:28.215 --> 25:29.614
You shouldn't encourage her, Rae.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.134
Lois is so desperate to have a
boyfriend

25:32.135 --> 25:33.854
that she's even started to
create fictional problems.

25:33.855 --> 25:35.854
I find it so sad.

25:35.855 --> 25:37.934
Her problem is that her
standards are way too high,

25:37.935 --> 25:39.334
and if she dropped them,

25:39.335 --> 25:41.174
she could probably get herself
a real-life boyfriend.

25:41.175 --> 25:42.535
Someone should say something.

25:48.615 --> 25:50.694
What is this music?

25:50.695 --> 25:53.774
Er, Mr Wendal by Arrested
Development. I hate it.

25:53.775 --> 25:56.454
Go and put something else on, Rae.
Something good.

25:56.455 --> 25:57.494
This music's doing my head in.

25:57.495 --> 25:59.254
Archie, put summat decent
on the jukebox.

25:59.255 --> 26:01.734
I'll do it.

26:01.735 --> 26:03.054
OK.

26:03.055 --> 26:05.254
No, I want Archie to do it.

26:05.255 --> 26:07.814
He knows his music.
I know my music.

26:07.815 --> 26:11.815
If you don't like what I put on,
I'll give you your 20p back.

26:32.735 --> 26:36.735
Tune. I love this song!

26:44.015 --> 26:45.735
Yeah, we practised this.

26:47.335 --> 26:49.055
Two, three, four...

26:51.335 --> 26:54.414
Well done!

26:54.415 --> 26:58.415
Dear Diary, because I was living
off chocolate bars and crisps at college,

26:58.895 --> 27:01.694
my consumption levels from Mum's
cupboard had skyrocketed.

27:01.695 --> 27:05.134
Fortunately, she had so
much food in the house that she'd...

27:05.135 --> 27:08.975
Oh, no.

27:17.495 --> 27:21.495
I'll deal with you in a minute.

27:21.775 --> 27:23.534
I thought this was going on.

27:23.535 --> 27:25.974
I've been going through the bins.

27:25.975 --> 27:29.975
Do you know what I found?

27:31.215 --> 27:35.215
This. Tell me what you see, Rae.

27:36.375 --> 27:38.094
Seven walnuts?

27:38.095 --> 27:41.254
Correct. Seven walnuts.

27:41.255 --> 27:45.255
Now, where's the sodding whips
that were attached to them?

27:46.055 --> 27:50.055
I... This cupboard is out of bounds.

27:50.775 --> 27:53.574
But... I'm locking it.

27:53.575 --> 27:57.575
Now, go.

28:00.815 --> 28:01.974
Karim!

28:01.975 --> 28:04.094
So what if my mum was locking
the cupboard

28:04.095 --> 28:05.854
and I couldn't eat in the canteen?

28:05.855 --> 28:07.814
I could get by on stocking up from
the vending machine

28:07.815 --> 28:11.815
during break.

28:17.015 --> 28:20.134
Hiya, Rae.
Are you coming to the Common Room?

28:20.135 --> 28:22.614
Yeah, sounds good.

28:22.615 --> 28:26.615
I was starting to see a major
drawback of being popular.

28:47.015 --> 28:51.015
Are you coming? What?

28:51.735 --> 28:54.294
Oh, shit!

28:54.295 --> 28:57.854
It's not about being angry with
yourself

28:57.855 --> 29:01.855
for getting anxious, it's
about finding a way to relax.

29:02.855 --> 29:05.094
So today, I'd like to work on some
techniques

29:05.095 --> 29:08.534
that hopefully will go some way
to achieving that.

29:08.535 --> 29:10.894
But before, I'd like to ask the group

29:10.895 --> 29:14.895
if they'd like to share
any of the ways in which they relax.

29:16.215 --> 29:20.215
Well, I meditate.
Every morning for 30 minutes.

29:21.215 --> 29:23.934
And then every evening
for 20 minutes.

29:23.935 --> 29:26.334
I also do Pilates and yoga.

29:26.335 --> 29:29.454
I'm also doing a course in
aromatherapy, it's amazing.

29:29.455 --> 29:31.455
You can't help but relax
when you smell chamomile!

29:33.855 --> 29:37.855
I like watching the ducks, er, feeding
the ducks. I find ducks very relaxing.

29:41.175 --> 29:44.894
Well, that's great,
Dan, thank you.

29:44.895 --> 29:48.814
Er, Rae.
I hope you don't mind me sharing,

29:48.815 --> 29:52.815
but the other day you were talking
about how important music is to you.

29:53.655 --> 29:56.534
Yeah, I like music.

29:56.535 --> 29:59.375
If I feel anxious or worried,
I'll just stick on a...

30:01.935 --> 30:05.934
Rae?

30:05.935 --> 30:07.854
Hiya.

30:07.855 --> 30:10.374
Rae?

30:10.375 --> 30:12.934
Can you hear me?

30:12.935 --> 30:14.935
What happened? You fainted.

30:17.055 --> 30:20.614
How many fingers? Three.

30:20.615 --> 30:24.174
Who's the Prime Minister?
John Major.

30:24.175 --> 30:28.175
Sad... but true.

30:28.655 --> 30:31.894
Please tell me you're not on some
crazy diet where you starve yourself.

30:31.895 --> 30:33.494
I'm not on a diet.

30:33.495 --> 30:37.495
Rae, don't fuck around with
things like this.

30:37.855 --> 30:41.855
You should know better than
anyone what the consequences can be.

30:44.735 --> 30:47.814
I don't want to come to this office
and get a phone call

30:47.815 --> 30:51.815
that's telling me that you're in
some... I am not on a diet. I swear.

30:54.095 --> 30:56.214
I swear.

30:56.215 --> 30:57.734
Whatever it is you're doing, Rae,

30:57.735 --> 31:01.575
just promise me that you'll look
after yourself.

31:37.655 --> 31:41.655
Are you all right, Stace?

31:43.135 --> 31:45.174
What you doing, Rae?

31:45.175 --> 31:47.334
I'm just checking out the books.

31:47.335 --> 31:50.974
What's in your hand?

31:50.975 --> 31:53.694
Nothing.

31:53.695 --> 31:57.695
Let me see.

31:59.135 --> 32:03.135
It's just a packet of crisps.

32:05.095 --> 32:09.095
Why are you eating a packet of
crisps up here on your own?

32:14.575 --> 32:18.575
Are we friends, Rae?

32:20.255 --> 32:21.454
Of course we're friends.

32:21.455 --> 32:24.574
You're supposed to be able to
tell your friends anything.

32:24.575 --> 32:28.575
So tell me what's going on.

32:34.815 --> 32:38.815
I just can't eat in front of people.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.894
Why not?

32:42.895 --> 32:46.895
Well, because if I eat unhealthy
food then people will think,

32:49.135 --> 32:51.894
"Oh, look at that fat cow,
no wonder she got to that size."

32:51.895 --> 32:55.895
And if I eat healthy food,
then they think,

32:56.695 --> 32:58.334
"Well, who are you trying to kid,
love?

32:58.335 --> 33:00.774
"You didn't get to that
size by eating salads."

33:00.775 --> 33:04.214
No-one would say anything to you.

33:04.215 --> 33:05.814
Not while I was around.

33:05.815 --> 33:09.815
They might not say it,
but they'll think it.

33:11.895 --> 33:15.895
Trust me. I can see it behind
their eyes.

33:17.215 --> 33:21.215
You know,
I used to think that I loved food.

33:22.495 --> 33:24.094
But I don't.

33:24.095 --> 33:28.095
I fucking hate it.

33:29.095 --> 33:33.095
Rae...

33:38.655 --> 33:41.174
Oh, and by the way, I've decided
that we're going to go...

33:41.175 --> 33:44.094
'I've never opened up to
someone like that before,

33:44.095 --> 33:47.374
'I couldn't talk to Liam about it,
or Kester about it,

33:47.375 --> 33:51.375
'so why could I talk to Stacey?
I didn't even know her.

33:52.935 --> 33:56.414
'I guess some people just have
something about them.'

33:56.415 --> 34:00.014
Oh, no, Lucy Clegg. Has to be.

34:00.015 --> 34:02.974
She wears a baseball cap, for God's
sake, she's a 16-year-old girl.

34:02.975 --> 34:06.494
I still think it's Sarah Holden.
I don't want to play this game.

34:06.495 --> 34:10.333
You're such a wimp, Lois.
Rae, what about you?

34:10.335 --> 34:11.813
What?

34:11.815 --> 34:14.014
Who's the biggest loser in college?

34:14.014 --> 34:15.614
Oh, I don't know.

34:15.614 --> 34:19.614
Sarah Holden has skid marks
in her knickers. Skid marks!

34:20.094 --> 34:22.853
Eurgh! Seriously, I was almost sick!

34:22.855 --> 34:25.014
Eww! Oh, come on, Rae,

34:25.014 --> 34:26.893
who do you think?
I honestly don't know.

34:26.895 --> 34:28.333
Rae!

34:28.335 --> 34:32.054
Well, Linda Carver's
a bit of a loser, I guess.

34:32.054 --> 34:36.054
Her glasses are bulletproof.
She's always walking round, reading.

34:37.975 --> 34:39.014
Why?

34:39.014 --> 34:40.734
Rae...

34:40.735 --> 34:43.614
What is that interesting that you
have to read about it,

34:43.614 --> 34:47.014
every second of every day?
It's just weird.

34:47.014 --> 34:51.014
I mean, come on. Get a fucking grip.

35:01.375 --> 35:05.375
Oh, my God.

35:05.575 --> 35:09.454
Oh, my God! This is too much.

35:09.455 --> 35:13.455
I can't believe you just did that,
Rae. Did you see her face?

35:14.815 --> 35:16.800
Jesus, Rae.

35:27.897 --> 35:29.717
What's going on?

35:29.793 --> 35:33.793
Rae, come and sit down.

35:34.033 --> 35:38.033
I've already apologised to Karim and
I wanted to say sorry to you, too.

35:39.153 --> 35:41.792
For losing the plot yesterday.

35:41.793 --> 35:45.793
I've been very stressed,
running around after that SPG lot.

35:45.913 --> 35:49.152
I didn't once get invited to any
event that I wasn't bloody hosting.

35:49.153 --> 35:53.153
So, I quit,
got my subscription money back.

35:54.033 --> 35:55.512
Here.

35:55.513 --> 35:58.992
It's the money for that pop album
you wanted.

35:58.993 --> 36:00.992
Is this a trap?

36:00.993 --> 36:04.993
No! Just take the money, Rae.

36:16.033 --> 36:17.832
Check out what I got from Morton.

36:17.833 --> 36:21.232
Nice!

36:21.233 --> 36:25.233
Think it's this way, come on.

36:25.273 --> 36:26.472
Oh, my God.

36:26.473 --> 36:30.473
Archie!

36:34.633 --> 36:36.712
Looks like she wasn't making it up.

36:36.713 --> 36:40.713
Excuse me a second,
just going to go say hello to Arch.

36:45.433 --> 36:47.712
What the fuck are you doing?

36:47.713 --> 36:51.713
I can explain. OK, go for it.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.232
All right, I can't explain.

36:55.233 --> 36:57.832
You are leading her on exactly
the same as what you did to me.

36:57.833 --> 37:00.552
I know, but what... Bu-bu-bu!

37:00.553 --> 37:04.553
You said... No! You promised that
you were going to stop being fake.

37:05.753 --> 37:08.152
I need to stop being fake?!

37:08.153 --> 37:10.792
Have you looked in a mirror lately?

37:10.793 --> 37:13.233
Rae!

37:16.193 --> 37:20.193
We are so far from fucking done.

37:26.232 --> 37:28.272
So where's this bar?
I could really do with a drink.

37:28.273 --> 37:32.273
It's not a bar, it's a restaurant.

37:43.793 --> 37:47.793
Um, can I have
the four cheeses pizza?

37:59.793 --> 38:03.672
Rae?

38:03.673 --> 38:05.432
Um...

38:05.433 --> 38:08.512
Maybe I'll just have
a small Margherita pizza, please.

38:08.513 --> 38:11.712
See.

38:11.713 --> 38:13.112
Cheers, everyone.

38:13.113 --> 38:17.113
Cheers.

38:19.553 --> 38:23.553
So I said, "Listen, no-one cares
about biology apart from you..."

38:24.673 --> 38:28.673
"..and that is only because you get
paid to teach it.".

38:31.153 --> 38:32.192
Chlo?

38:32.193 --> 38:36.193
Could you go and can get me
some spare napkins?

38:36.953 --> 38:39.832
Why me?

38:39.833 --> 38:42.632
I don't know, I was...

38:42.633 --> 38:46.633
I was only asking a favour.

38:48.233 --> 38:50.912
Yeah.

38:50.913 --> 38:53.912
Thanks.

38:53.913 --> 38:57.913
I might as well tell you guys now, because
it's out. I'm going out with Archie.

38:59.993 --> 39:01.632
From second year.

39:01.633 --> 39:02.952
Archie Archie?!

39:02.953 --> 39:04.912
Yeah. He's fit.

39:04.913 --> 39:08.913
I know and... we've just told each
other that we love each other.

39:12.113 --> 39:14.832
Babe, are you all right?

39:14.833 --> 39:18.833
I'm... I'm just so happy.

39:23.873 --> 39:26.553
I'm going for a slash.

39:29.713 --> 39:33.713
Guys, is Amy serious about wearing
that trackie top on a night out?!

39:34.553 --> 39:38.553
I mean, I know she's got this whole
keeping her street cred thing

39:38.673 --> 39:41.592
going on, but seriously,
she just looks rough.

39:41.593 --> 39:45.552
Someone should say something.

39:45.553 --> 39:48.392
'That's when I realised
these girls weren't friends,

39:48.393 --> 39:52.393
'Stacey just wanted people around
who had vulnerabilities
that she could exploit

39:53.593 --> 39:56.472
'to make herself feel better.

39:56.473 --> 39:57.792
'That's why I was there.'

39:57.793 --> 40:01.793
Oh, my God, Rae - nice bracelet.

40:02.993 --> 40:06.192
'And to be honest,
I wasn't much better.

40:06.193 --> 40:08.752
'I was a phoney.

40:08.753 --> 40:12.753
'Just like Archie.'

40:16.273 --> 40:20.272
Oh, thank you.

40:20.273 --> 40:24.273
Thanks.

40:27.473 --> 40:30.352
Fuck it.

40:30.353 --> 40:31.592
Rae, where are you going?

40:31.593 --> 40:34.712
I don't want to be here.

40:34.713 --> 40:35.832
What do you mean?

40:35.833 --> 40:37.872
I don't want to be around you.

40:37.873 --> 40:40.352
I've got nothing against
the rest of you.

40:40.353 --> 40:42.872
What did you just say?

40:42.873 --> 40:44.832
You're mean.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.232
And you're not a nice person.

40:46.233 --> 40:48.752
You manipulate everybody.

40:48.753 --> 40:49.872
No.

40:49.873 --> 40:53.392
I'll tell you what this is about,
Rae!

40:53.393 --> 40:54.752
This isn't about me,

40:54.753 --> 40:58.753
this is about the fact that you
can't eat in front of people.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.032
See you later, Chlo.

41:23.033 --> 41:24.273
Later, girls.

41:45.953 --> 41:49.432
Oh, there she is.

41:49.433 --> 41:52.712
Be not afeared,
the isle is full of noises.

41:52.713 --> 41:56.713
Sounds and sweet airs that give
delight and hurt not.

41:57.713 --> 42:01.713
Why, thank you. Ha-ha.

42:03.753 --> 42:04.792
What are you up to?

42:04.793 --> 42:08.793
Eating chips and drinking beer. My
very own patented relaxation method.

43:02.193 --> 43:04.632
I don't know why you
hang around with her, Chloe.

43:04.633 --> 43:07.232
She's so horrible to you.

43:07.233 --> 43:08.632
Yeah.

43:08.633 --> 43:11.152
I've never seen you like this
before.

43:11.153 --> 43:15.153
I've never seen you take
orders off anyone.

43:16.233 --> 43:19.832
Oh, no. What are you doing here?

43:19.833 --> 43:22.672
Chloe, I said we weren't
hanging around with her, ever.

43:22.673 --> 43:25.712
I don't care how long
you've known her.

43:25.713 --> 43:28.672
I'm sorry, Rae.

43:28.673 --> 43:30.712
Go on, Rae.

43:30.713 --> 43:33.032
Piss off!

43:33.033 --> 43:34.392
Actually, Stacey.

43:34.393 --> 43:37.472
I'm apologising for not doing this
sooner.

43:37.473 --> 43:38.632
Doing what sooner?

43:38.633 --> 43:42.472
Telling you to piss off.

43:42.473 --> 43:44.672
I had to gather my evidence first.

43:44.673 --> 43:45.992
What are you talking about?

43:45.993 --> 43:49.272
Well, on Wednesday,
you said of Vicky, and I quote,

43:49.273 --> 43:53.152
"She needs to stop putting
so much foundation on.

43:53.153 --> 43:57.153
"I know she wants to hide her skin,
but it doesn't, it just makes it worse.

43:57.313 --> 43:59.512
"Pretty soon she'll be putting
it on with a trowel.

43:59.513 --> 44:01.472
"Someone should say something."

44:01.473 --> 44:03.632
I didn't say that.

44:03.633 --> 44:07.633
On Thursday, you said of Lois, "Lois
is so desperate to have a boyfriend,

44:08.873 --> 44:11.992
"she's even started to create
fictional problems.

44:11.993 --> 44:13.832
"I find it so sad.

44:13.833 --> 44:16.192
"Do you know, her problem has always
been

44:16.193 --> 44:17.952
"that her standards are way too high.

44:17.953 --> 44:21.792
"If she dropped them, then she
might have a real-life boyfriend.

44:21.793 --> 44:23.792
"Someone should say something."

44:23.793 --> 44:25.552
I didn't say that, Lois.

44:25.553 --> 44:29.553
On Saturday, you said of Amy...
I didn't say anything, Chloe.

44:29.753 --> 44:32.792
You've got no proof of any of this.

44:32.793 --> 44:35.392
Do you know, I thought you
might say that.

44:35.393 --> 44:39.393
So I took the liberty of recording
everything you said at your birthday.

44:42.873 --> 44:46.873
'Guys, is Amy serious about wearing
that trackie top on a night out?

44:48.753 --> 44:52.272
'I mean, I know she's got this whole
keeping the street cred thing

44:52.273 --> 44:54.912
'going on, but seriously,
she just looks rough.

44:54.913 --> 44:57.273
'Someone should say something.'

44:58.313 --> 45:00.712
Someone is saying something, Stacey.

45:00.713 --> 45:03.192
I'm saying something. Amy...

45:03.193 --> 45:04.552
Don't bother.

45:04.553 --> 45:08.553
I'm saying you're a bitch
and it's just come right back

45:09.313 --> 45:10.592
and bit you on the arse.

45:10.593 --> 45:12.352
Right?

45:12.353 --> 45:14.473
Now, piss off.

45:28.473 --> 45:31.672
It turned out Stacey's vulnerability
was that she just

45:31.673 --> 45:33.032
wasn't as clever as Chloe.

45:33.033 --> 45:37.033
In the game of bitches,
there was only one queen bitch.

45:40.073 --> 45:44.073
But at least Chloe was honest.

45:45.233 --> 45:47.752
Even if it hurt.

45:47.753 --> 45:49.352
Well?

45:49.353 --> 45:50.672
What?

45:50.673 --> 45:54.673
Are you going to do the right thing?

45:55.513 --> 45:58.072
Stay out of it, Rae.

45:58.073 --> 45:59.632
No.

45:59.633 --> 46:02.432
No, I'm not going to stay out of it.

46:02.433 --> 46:03.712
I'm an honest person.

46:03.713 --> 46:05.672
I'm not going to let this happen.

46:05.673 --> 46:08.152
It's none of your business, Rae.

46:08.153 --> 46:09.952
I mean it.

46:09.953 --> 46:13.953
Break-up with her, or else.

46:14.073 --> 46:15.432
Or else what?

46:15.433 --> 46:17.272
Be quiet.

46:17.273 --> 46:21.273
Hiya, boo-boo.

46:21.953 --> 46:23.152
What's going on?

46:23.153 --> 46:25.672
Arch?

46:25.673 --> 46:29.673
Nothing. Tell me.

46:34.753 --> 46:38.153
Archie is gay, Lois.

46:41.513 --> 46:44.032
What?

46:44.033 --> 46:47.592
Archie?

46:47.593 --> 46:51.232
Rae...

46:51.233 --> 46:53.073
Oh, my God.
