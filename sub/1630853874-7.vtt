00:12.345 --> 00:14.055
If my mom knew
I was out on a weekday,

00:14.139 --> 00:15.306
she'd ground me till summer.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.225
-Your mom scares me.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.519
That's why I didn't tell my mom
where I'm going today.

00:19.602 --> 00:22.856
Good, because I am definitely not allowed
to be on a date right now.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.275
Which this is, right?

00:25.358 --> 00:27.527
-Yeah, obviously.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.363
Okay, on three, say where your mom
thinks you are right now.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.740
One, two, three…

00:31.823 --> 00:32.866
Debate practice.

00:32.949 --> 00:36.119
-Whoa! You do debate too?
-Only since the first grade.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.705
Huh. Then I guess you and I
have a little showdown coming up

00:38.788 --> 00:40.373
at the Valley Regional Debate Tournament.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.501
2V2 public forum.
I look forward to cross-firing you.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.961
<i>Oh, snap!</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:47.839
<i>That was the hottest thing</i>
<i>a guy had ever said to Devi.</i>

00:47.922 --> 00:51.885
<i>And yet, there was one little thing</i>
<i>that was still bothering her.</i>

00:51.968 --> 00:54.095
Hey, so can I ask you a question?

00:55.680 --> 00:56.639
Why did you ghost me?

00:57.932 --> 00:59.934
Look, I'm sorry. That was shitty of me.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.729
But after that party,
I kinda started to wonder

01:02.812 --> 01:05.940
if I should really be hitting on a girl
who was just crying over another guy.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.984
Uh, I was only crying for,
like, six minutes.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.779
-But I see your point.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.907
You should know though, I'm over Paxton.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.201
I actually like someone else.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.375
-It's me, right?
-Yeah.

01:32.675 --> 01:34.427
Good morning,
you beautiful bitches.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.304
Wow, someone's in a chipper mood.

01:36.387 --> 01:40.558
Yes, I am because a talent agent
just emailed me about auditioning for her.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.393
-Congrats!
-That's awesome!

01:42.477 --> 01:45.188
Thanks! Seems like the commercials I did
really showcased my craft.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.816
Do you need some privacy
on your Jolly Roger?

01:47.899 --> 01:50.527
Set your sails for Captain Joe's Blinds.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.737
Thar she blinds!

01:52.821 --> 01:53.905
All sales are final.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.615
Can anyone help me tape it this weekend?

01:55.698 --> 01:57.951
Sorry, El. Devi and I
have our debate tournament.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.161
Mmm. That's okay. I'll have Trent do it.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.413
Wait. So, Devi, are you excited

02:02.497 --> 02:04.499
to go up against Des
at the tournament this weekend?

02:04.582 --> 02:05.959
That's kind of spicy, huh?

02:06.042 --> 02:07.919
I know, right? We're gonna go at it.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.337
And then, we're gonna go at it,

02:09.420 --> 02:11.214
for a couple of minutes
until our moms pick us up.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.632
Do they suspect anything yet?

02:12.715 --> 02:15.218
Nope. That's the best part
of our moms being friends.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.679
We've been hanging out for weeks,
and they don't have a clue.

02:17.762 --> 02:21.850
Ugh! There's nothing sexier
than a secret <i>liaison</i> <i>dangereux.</i>

02:21.933 --> 02:26.354
<i> Little did they know, there was</i>
<i>another </i>liaison dangereux <i>in their midst,</i>

02:26.437 --> 02:28.940
<i>who were finally ready to go </i>publique.

02:29.023 --> 02:31.442
There is something
that Aneesa and I would like to announce.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.278
We are together.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.698
What? How? When? Why?
Well, I know why. You guys are both hot.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.617
Well, we kinda kissed
a while ago.

02:39.701 --> 02:40.743
You did?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.370
Yeah. We both had crushes in secret,

02:42.453 --> 02:44.455
but decided to make it official
at the coffeehouse.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.374
Holy crap, you guys. This is so exciting.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.086
-Ah!

02:51.004 --> 02:55.049
-Hey, so what should we do tonight?
-I don't know. Hook up in your garage?

02:55.133 --> 02:58.178
Yeah, but we always do that.
Don't you get bored doing the same thing?

02:58.261 --> 03:00.346
I mean, what if we mix it up a little?

03:00.430 --> 03:02.640
Like, what if we went
to an art gallery or something?

03:02.724 --> 03:03.933
Would we get drunk before?

03:04.017 --> 03:06.269
Oh my God, that's such a good idea.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.230
Never mind. Let's just meet at my place.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.442
You should write movies, Paxton.
You're, like, so hilarious.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.575
Look at us, we're offish.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.619
Yo, Sherman Oaks,
hot couple alert.

03:22.702 --> 03:26.122
I know. Watch out, school,
Aneeola is here.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.042
Hmm. That sounds like a body part.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.668
What about Fabees?

03:31.377 --> 03:32.837
No, that sounds like Febreze.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.923
How about just Fabiola and Aneesa?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.592
-Oh.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.387
-Um, were you going for a hug or a kiss?
-I don't know. What were you doing?

03:41.471 --> 03:44.682
Like, are we PDA people or not?
Or like what's our goodbye ritual?

03:44.766 --> 03:47.644
-You know what, let's not overthink this.
-Yeah.

03:48.144 --> 03:48.978
Uh--

03:52.440 --> 03:54.359
-I'll see you later!
-Yep. Yep. Sorry.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.737
Des, Devi! Dinner in five!

03:59.197 --> 04:01.491
Hmm? Hey! Are you nuts?

04:01.574 --> 04:02.867
What if our moms catch us?

04:02.951 --> 04:04.953
How are we supposed to make out
if we're decapitated?

04:05.036 --> 04:06.913
-Maybe they'll bury our heads together?

04:08.498 --> 04:11.376
"Easy practice sesh
at Sherman Oaks High"?

04:11.459 --> 04:15.088
Hey, are you calling our debate tournament
an easy practice sesh?

04:15.171 --> 04:17.632
Oh. Um, sorry. That's just how they put it
on the team calendar.

04:17.715 --> 04:20.426
Wait, so you guys think
you're gonna just show up and destroy us

04:20.510 --> 04:22.804
because you're
from a fancy private school?

04:22.887 --> 04:26.808
No. I mean, do we think
we have a good chance at winning?

04:26.891 --> 04:29.435
Yeah, but only because we always do.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.728
We've come close a few times.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.773
Well, that's because we usually send
our freshmen to compete against you.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.275
You do? Huh.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.360
I guess that's why we've never met before

04:37.443 --> 04:39.821
and why I thought everyone
at your school was strangely small.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.365
But this time,
we're bringing our senior squad.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.449
So you and I can hang out.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.160
Wait, are you mad?

04:46.244 --> 04:47.912
I'm not trying to be insulting.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.956
It's just Hartman Hill
is nationally ranked,

04:50.039 --> 04:51.791
and we mostly compete against colleges.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.669
So what? Our school's
had four people audition for <i>The Voice.</i>

04:54.752 --> 04:56.087
And only two of them are now dead.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.339
Look, we have an unfair advantage.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.425
Our school just has
more resources than yours.

05:00.508 --> 05:03.803
The real problem is how underfunded
the public school system is.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.389
My school's doing just fine,
thank you.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.599
Look, I really didn't mean to offend you.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.268
Uh-- Well, I'm not offended.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.352
You should be offended

05:11.436 --> 05:14.063
by how badly you're gonna get crushed
at tomorrow's tournament.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.858
Okay. I look forward to it.

05:16.941 --> 05:17.817
Hmm.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.987
Kamala, you're gonna love this.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.198
It says sexy 'cause, you know.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.742
There's my label maker

05:25.825 --> 05:28.161
and what's left
of my expensive label tape,

05:28.244 --> 05:30.288
but yes, you are very sexy.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.040
-Mmm.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.166
What's all this gear?

05:33.249 --> 05:36.085
You got tape. You got trash bags.
What, you burying a body?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.546
Am I dating a future true crime star?

05:38.629 --> 05:40.923
No, I told my aunt
that I would help organize

05:41.007 --> 05:42.258
some of my grandmother's things.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.969
Yesterday, a pile of her boxes
from India toppled over

05:45.053 --> 05:47.096
and trapped her
for like 12 hours.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.892
Well, don't worry, she's fine. She said
it was the best sleep she's had in years.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.852
I'd ask you to come, but you know.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.562
Yeah. Granny hates me.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.772
I get it. No worries.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.816
I have to judge a debate tournament
at the school today anyways,

05:58.900 --> 06:01.319
and those kids hate me slightly less.

06:01.402 --> 06:04.113
Mmm, sounds like we both have
thrilling Saturdays lined up.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.698
Yeah, why are we so boring?

06:05.782 --> 06:09.952
You know what? We should make up
for it tomorrow with a little bit of…

06:12.580 --> 06:15.708
And when I said that we were gonna
destroy Hartman Hill, Des laughed.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.544
Ergo, he thinks he's gonna win.
So we have to beat them.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.214
Although, I'd rather you not entangle
my academic pursuits

06:21.297 --> 06:22.799
in whatever kink this is for you,

06:22.882 --> 06:25.843
I'm gonna have to side with your
<i>Love Island-</i>looking boyfriend on this one.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.845
-Hartman Hill's gonna crush us.
-What?

06:27.929 --> 06:31.349
Yeah. I heard that their new coach
is the computer that won <i>Jeopardy.</i>

06:31.432 --> 06:33.142
Ben, since when do you just give up?

06:33.226 --> 06:36.229
Look, I'm trying not to get so hung up
on what other people are doing.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.398
Whatever.
We still have to try to beat them.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.984
How? Hartman Hill has LexisNexis Premium.
That means no commercials.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.445
Yeah. The only periodical
we have in our library

06:44.529 --> 06:45.947
is a free neighborhood paper.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.323
<i>Sherman Oaks Tootler.</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:50.368
The one that always arrives soaked
no matter what the weather is?

06:50.451 --> 06:53.704
Yep. This one from December's headline
is about a guy named Pete Flume

06:53.788 --> 06:56.416
who put up so many Christmas lights,
it blacked out his neighborhood.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.625
Hard-hitting stuff.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.546
Mr. Flume says, "It is my sacrosanct duty

07:01.629 --> 07:03.756
to infuse my neighborhood
with Christmas cheer."

07:03.840 --> 07:07.927
"And yes, that starts with a 20-foot-tall,
topless Mrs. Claus."

07:08.010 --> 07:10.096
Mmm. That should help us in the debate.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.766
<i> Organized debate</i>

07:14.434 --> 07:18.896
can be traced all the way back
to the bosom of democracy.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.064
He said bosom.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.066
There, philosophers and politicians

07:22.150 --> 07:25.027
would joust not with swords
but with their tongues.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.529
He said tongues.

07:26.612 --> 07:32.326
And they would assemble for such debates
atop a hill known as the Pnyx.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.912
-He said--
-Okay, let's get this tournament going.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.207
Teams, you can see your room assignments
on the board. Good luck.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.711
And, Eric, you're not even in debate.
You should be in Saturday detention. Go.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.968
So, looks like we're
on opposite sides of the bracket.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.679
I guess we'll have to wait till the finals
to squash you ding-dongs.

07:51.762 --> 07:55.099
It'd be awesome if you made the finals.
We'll see how things go.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.477
I'm telling you how it'll go.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.395
Badly for you, goodly for me.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.106
But we'll still make out later, right?

08:02.815 --> 08:05.193
Stop trying to flirt with me.
We're mortal enemies today.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.529
-And yes, we can make out later.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.866
Resolved, that performance-enhancing drugs
should be allowed in sports.

08:11.949 --> 08:14.577
Let's see what
the human body can do, baby.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.999
It's clear that two-day shipping
is a very real threat to our society.

08:21.417 --> 08:26.380
So for the sake of our children,
we must do more vertical farming.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.886
All right. Camera, ready. Action.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.514
I'm Eleanor Wong, and I'm 5'5",

08:34.597 --> 08:37.433
and I'll be doing Jennifer Lopez's speech
from <i>Hustlers</i>.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.393
-Cut.
-What do you mean, "cut"?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.811
I haven't even started.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.980
Sorry, I just feel
like it's missing something.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.482
Yeah, the whole monologue.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.235
No, that's not it. I'm worried
it's not gonna pop, you know?

08:47.318 --> 08:49.779
You need to be memorable
if this agent is gonna sign you.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.657
Is that why you brought a stripper pole?

08:52.740 --> 08:54.784
She's not even stripping
during the speech!

08:54.867 --> 08:57.578
-I'm just trying to get levels.
-Sorry I dragged you here.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.955
Thought this would be more fun.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.999
Oh, I'm having fun.
I love watching people fight.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.794
-I'm a big UFC fan.
-Let me explain my vision, okay?

09:04.877 --> 09:07.630
Babe, I'm just talking about
some subtle ambiance. Let me show you.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.840
Imagine doing your monologue,

09:09.924 --> 09:12.260
ripping those lines straight out
of your mouth hole.

09:12.343 --> 09:15.721
And just as your speech
climaxes super hard,

09:16.430 --> 09:17.473
this happens.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.601
Are you kidding me?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.186
Oh shit. I'm so sorry!

09:22.270 --> 09:25.147
The guy behind Baskin-Robbins assured me
these were the ones for pussies.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.817
-Eleanor! Wait!

09:30.027 --> 09:31.779
Oh shit.

09:32.947 --> 09:37.827
And we have our finalists!
Congrats to Sherman Oaks and Hartman Hill.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.038
And to the other teams,

09:41.122 --> 09:44.542
just remember there is no such thing
as losing, only learning.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.462
I've actually lost every competition
I've ever entered.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.797
Hey, David.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.465
Don't be insufferable about this,

09:51.549 --> 09:53.718
but you may have been right
to think that we can win.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.928
Yeah, I know, right? We've been on fire.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.472
I mean, aside from
their beautifully tailored blazers,

09:58.556 --> 10:00.975
what do they have that we don't?
Absolutely no--

10:01.058 --> 10:04.854
A team of paralegals
and a fancy-looking omniscient computer.

10:04.937 --> 10:08.441
That's the computer that won <i>Jeopardy.</i>
We're so screwed!

10:08.524 --> 10:10.735
Okay, let's get to our final topic.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.988
Is the privatization
of outer space a just cause?

10:14.071 --> 10:17.783
Sherman Oaks, you won the coin toss.
Which side will you argue?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.744
<i>Aw, shit. Which one's easier?</i>

10:20.536 --> 10:22.121
<i>Look at them, so comfortable.</i>

10:22.705 --> 10:24.206
<i>Pits as dry as the Sahara.</i>

10:24.790 --> 10:26.834
<i>Is this a trap? What do we do?</i>

10:26.917 --> 10:28.336
Uh, affirmative.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.421
Hartman Hill, you will argue the negative.

10:31.756 --> 10:35.551
Uh, unless the school burns down.
Everybody out, single file.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.304
Okay. Very quickly,
but respect each other's bodies.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.016
Okay, I'm assuming this goes in the trash?

10:42.099 --> 10:44.935
No, that's a definite keeper.
<i>-Mami,</i> you got to get rid of some things.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.563
You've only lived here a year
and have more things than Devi and I.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.858
I can't help that I have an eye
for incredible treasures.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.943
Like this bag of wrapping paper scraps?

10:53.027 --> 10:55.988
That's the perfect shape if I wanted
to give someone a straw as a gift.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.990
Kamala, you should take
your grandmother inside,

10:58.074 --> 10:59.617
and put away things from the keep pile.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.078
Rhyah and I will stay out here
and continue sorting.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.746
Okay. Come, <i>Pati.</i>

11:04.455 --> 11:05.998
Okay.

11:06.082 --> 11:09.168
Oh. What's this wheelchair?

11:09.752 --> 11:13.172
Um, that was actually Devi's.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.090
What?

11:14.882 --> 11:15.716
What happened?

11:17.718 --> 11:20.262
Oh, well, um…

11:20.930 --> 11:23.182
When Mohan died,
it was really hard on Devi,

11:23.265 --> 11:26.352
and, um, this really wild thing happened

11:26.435 --> 11:29.605
where she temporarily lost feeling
in her legs.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.400
Oh no! That must have been so scary.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.943
Hmm, yeah, it was terrifying.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.822
Last couple of years have been
a bit of a roller-coaster ride for us.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.325
-You wanna talk about it?
-I don't know.

11:41.409 --> 11:46.372
You know, she's… she's just been angry,
and she's acted out a lot.

11:46.455 --> 11:49.083
And she even got suspended from school.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.251
Oh God.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.421
Yeah, but she's doing so much better.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.424
I'm sorry you've had
such struggles, Nalini.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.134
I can't imagine how hard it's been.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.344
Thank you.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.763
And Des has just always been so easy.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.268
I need to remember
to feel gratitude about that.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.186
Thank you.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.110
Ugh! I can't believe my boyfriend
is an arsonist.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.738
This is actually good.
We needed a beat anyway.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.741
There is no way Hartman Hill's allowed
to have paralegals, right?

12:21.824 --> 12:24.994
I mean, there's nothing in the rule book
against it. So it's technically legal.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.873
<i>Hey, congrats on getting</i>
<i>to the finals, killer!</i>

12:28.956 --> 12:31.375
<i>My team went on a matcha run.</i>
<i>Can I grab you something?</i>

12:31.459 --> 12:33.085
Hartman Hill is getting matcha.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.296
They're so relaxed,
they need an energy boost?

12:35.379 --> 12:36.797
And he called you "killer."

12:36.881 --> 12:38.966
It's what my grandmother's
kickboxing coach calls her,

12:39.049 --> 12:40.468
and she does the class seated.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.179
<i> Devi knew</i>
<i>that Des was trying to be nice,</i>

12:43.262 --> 12:46.474
<i>but it was infuriating</i>
<i>how unthreatened he was.</i>

12:46.557 --> 12:49.226
<i>The only thing separating</i>
<i>his team from hers was money,</i>

12:49.810 --> 12:53.022
<i>which paid for professionals</i>
<i>to do all their research,</i>

12:53.105 --> 12:56.942
<i>research that was sitting</i>
<i>in the school completely unguarded.</i>

12:57.026 --> 12:59.111
<i>No, Devi, that's cheating.</i>

12:59.695 --> 13:02.448
<i>But then again,</i>
<i>weren't they kind of cheating?</i>

13:02.531 --> 13:06.952
<i>This was an unfair playing field,</i>
<i>and perhaps it was time to level it.</i>

13:07.036 --> 13:11.165
-Man, she is going off. You okay?

13:11.749 --> 13:14.502
No, I'm not okay. I'm thriving.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.296
What? But you guys are in a fight.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.089
Nah, that's just what El and I do.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.675
We rile each other up,
and then we love each other down.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.428
If you tried to dick tap me right now,
you'd probably break your hand.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.471
Okay.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.973
Honestly, being in a relationship
this passionate,

13:28.474 --> 13:30.267
it's like the best high I've ever had.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.978
And I've been struck
by lightning.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.189
I don't know, man, seems like a lot.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.315
Oh, you do you.

13:37.358 --> 13:40.569
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Daddy's gotta go get scolded.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.176
Hey! Devi, what are you doing in here?

14:04.802 --> 14:07.388
Oh, um, I was just, uh…

14:07.471 --> 14:10.224
seeing if any students
needed to be saved from the fire.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.018
Nope. All good.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.603
Let's debate, bro.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.193
Aneesa, what are you doing here?

14:21.277 --> 14:23.863
I'm here to be a good girlfriend.
Look, I made you a sign.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.448
Oh. Thank you.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.994
No, no, I hold it. This is what
girlfriends do at football games.

14:30.077 --> 14:30.953
Oh.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.413
So when do you go out there?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.164
I don't. I'm just an alternate.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.500
So I sit here
unless someone calls out sick.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.211
Oh. Okay.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.464
Cool. Guess I'll just sit over here then.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.758
Well, I definitely didn't move it.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.051
Hey, we're missing a binder.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.263
Uh, I didn't touch it.
It was probably the new paralegal.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.599
I saw her order
a Bloody Mary at breakfast.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.480
Tell you what, I think that fire
kind of ruined the flow of things.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.567
So in the interest of keeping things fair,

15:01.650 --> 15:04.653
I think Sherman Oaks and Hartman Hill
should switch sides.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.196
Uh-- Objection, Your Honor.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.449
To what? To fairness, Devi?

15:09.116 --> 15:10.367
Um, no.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.286
That's what I thought.

15:12.995 --> 15:13.829
Let's begin.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.082
Okay, now here's a box that's a keeper.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.836
Look at all these old photos
and several rolling pins,

15:20.920 --> 15:22.296
but mostly photos.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.715
Oh, look there's you.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.342
Oh, and <i>Tata.</i>

15:27.051 --> 15:28.928
This is when we used to have
ice cream Sundays,

15:29.011 --> 15:31.555
which was when all we would eat
on Sunday was ice cream.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.765
I always got very sick.

15:32.848 --> 15:36.894
I remember. I was the one who had
to feed you clear<i> rasam</i> the next day.

15:36.977 --> 15:40.648
Oh, I miss <i>Tata.</i>
He was so much fun.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.525
Yes, sometimes a little too fun.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.277
I loved your grandfather,

15:45.361 --> 15:47.947
but he was more of a dreamer than a doer.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.116
How so?

15:51.200 --> 15:55.704
He never liked any job that he had,
so he frequently had no job at all.

15:55.788 --> 15:59.041
And I had to make what little
we did have stretch a long way.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.210
Why do you think I save all this stuff?

16:01.919 --> 16:03.295
<i>Pati,</i> I had no idea.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.800
But it does give a whole new meaning
to this shoebox filled with loose sporks.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.095
<i>Kanna,</i> this is what scares me
about Manish.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.682
That you will have to be a parent to him,
like I was to my husband.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.976
I look at Manish
with his high-top sneakers

16:17.059 --> 16:19.061
and sparkly men's earrings,

16:19.144 --> 16:20.646
and I don't see a grown-up.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.856
I don't see someone
who can make sacrifices

16:22.940 --> 16:24.316
for you and your family.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.570
<i>Pati,</i> I know you're trying to protect me.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.572
But Manish is not <i>Tata.</i>

16:30.656 --> 16:34.034
And one day,
I hope he'll get to prove that to you.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.872
And that's time.
Let's move on to closing statements.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.749
Hartman Hill, you're up first.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.752
Our planet
becomes less habitable by the day,

16:43.836 --> 16:46.797
so private space exploration
is imperative to human survival.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.883
As a local venture capitalist stated
in a recent <i>LA Times </i>op-ed,

16:49.967 --> 16:51.844
"It is our sacrosanct duty…"

16:51.927 --> 16:53.554
He said stank doodie.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.597
Eric, go to detention!

16:56.181 --> 16:57.933
<i>Wait, Eric was right.</i>

16:58.017 --> 16:59.685
<i>Not about the stank part.</i>

16:59.768 --> 17:01.979
<i>Des did say "sacrosanct duty."</i>

17:02.062 --> 17:04.231
<i>Why did that phrase sound so familiar?</i>

17:04.314 --> 17:06.734
"It is our sacrosanct duty
as private companies

17:06.817 --> 17:08.485
to ensure the future of our species."

17:08.569 --> 17:11.363
"So those beautiful twinkling lights
in the sky

17:11.447 --> 17:13.949
can still represent hope."

17:14.033 --> 17:15.909
-Thank you.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.787
Sherman Oaks, you're up.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.915
Before I begin, what was the name

17:21.999 --> 17:23.792
of the venture capitalist
who wrote that op-ed?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.045
Oh, uh, yeah, Peter Flume.

17:26.128 --> 17:29.048
-Hell yeah. I need the <i>Tootler.</i>
-What?

17:29.131 --> 17:30.507
The<i> Sherman Oaks Tootler</i>.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.385
-I wrapped my sandwich in it.
-Oh my God.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.099
I'd like to introduce into evidence

17:39.183 --> 17:42.019
the December 9th edition
of the <i>Sherman Oaks Tootler.</i>

17:42.603 --> 17:45.439
Turns out your boy
is a resident of Sherman Oaks,

17:45.939 --> 17:48.484
and his mansion's pervy Christmas display

17:48.567 --> 17:52.821
was so big
that it cut power to a local hospital.

17:54.031 --> 17:58.577
My fellow humans, guys like this
don't care about anyone else.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.289
Privatization makes the world
a crappier, more unjust place.

18:02.372 --> 18:07.961
No matter if it's in
space exploration or in education.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.256
Let's go!

18:12.049 --> 18:14.093
Okay. It's unanimous.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.762
With that closing statement,
Sherman Oaks is the winner.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.472
-Yes!

18:18.555 --> 18:21.892
-Way to go!

18:23.894 --> 18:27.898
And, Ms. Vishwakumar,
if you could just hang back for a second.

18:28.690 --> 18:29.525
Mmm.

18:30.859 --> 18:34.279
Amazing job, babe. You looked like
you could have subbed in at any moment.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.366
Well, I'm glad I didn't.
I hate public speaking.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.493
I don't know why
I signed up for debate.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.289
Oh! Ahh! My incisors.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.708
Damn. What's going on with us?
Why are we so awkward?

18:46.792 --> 18:48.877
I don't know. I really like you.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.420
I really like you too.

18:50.504 --> 18:54.049
I think it's probably always weird
when you go from friends to girlfriends.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.426
But we'll get there.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.304
Yeah, in… in no time,
we're going to be PDAing so hard,

18:59.388 --> 19:00.722
people will be like, "Get a room."

19:04.685 --> 19:05.686
Congrats on the win.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.481
Hey, look what I found in the trash.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.776
Hartman Hill's missing binder.
It's weird, huh?

19:13.360 --> 19:14.862
Super weird.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.989
Why'd they throw it away?

19:17.072 --> 19:19.825
You know what,
rich people just don't value property

19:19.908 --> 19:21.034
the same way you and I do--

19:21.118 --> 19:23.036
Devi, stop it. I know you cheated.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.290
And the sad thing is,
you didn't even have to.

19:26.373 --> 19:30.085
Uh-- I did it in the name of justice.
Did you not see their paralegals?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.461
I'm basically Jean Valjean.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.714
Yeah, well,
then I'm a better singing Russell Crowe

19:33.797 --> 19:35.465
because now I gotta take you to prison,

19:35.549 --> 19:39.178
aka your house, aka the place
where everyone hates me already.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.972
So this is just fantastic.
Get your bag. Let's go.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.813
So, what are your plans after graduation?

19:50.397 --> 19:52.441
Oh, um, I hadn't really thought about it.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.235
I bet there'll be, like,
a graduation party that night,

19:55.319 --> 19:56.612
so I'll probably go to that.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.823
I meant, like,
do you want to go to college--

19:59.907 --> 20:00.991
Quiet on set, people!

20:01.074 --> 20:02.910
Eleanor and I have come to a compromise,

20:02.993 --> 20:04.828
which is that we think
Eleanor's way is best.

20:04.912 --> 20:09.082
All right, babe.
Lights, camera, cell phone.

20:09.750 --> 20:14.213
I'm Eleanor Wong. I'm 5'5",
and this is Jennifer Lopez in <i>Hustlers.</i>

20:15.047 --> 20:15.881
Look, baby.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.218
We gotta start thinking
like these Wall Street guys.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.053
You see what they did to this country?

20:21.136 --> 20:23.472
They stole from everybody.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.933
Hardworking people lost everything.

20:26.516 --> 20:29.102
You ever think about when they come
into the club?

20:29.186 --> 20:30.395
That's stolen money.

20:30.979 --> 20:31.855
Eff these guys.

20:36.068 --> 20:36.944
Cut!

20:39.488 --> 20:42.616
You killed it, babe! These agents
are gonna sign the shit out of you.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.993
And I can't believe you used
my mom's stripper pole.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.287
It was perfect. Thank you for pushing me.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.331
You make me better.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.499
You make me better.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.551
-Hold on.
-Seriously?

21:01.635 --> 21:02.636
Oh boy.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.473
Manish? What a pleasant surprise
you did not clear with me beforehand.

21:06.556 --> 21:09.351
Yeah. Hello, everyone. Sorry to interrupt.
I'll just cut to the chase.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.062
I caught Devi cheating
in the debate tournament today.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.481
I'm… I'm sorry. She did what?

21:14.564 --> 21:16.024
Oh, that is serious.

21:16.942 --> 21:20.696
It seems like it's a family moment.
I'll just go back into the garage.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.782
Devi, how could you?

21:23.865 --> 21:26.451
So, what does this mean?
Is she suspended again?

21:26.535 --> 21:28.870
I decided not to inform the principal.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.748
Seems like something
you'd rather handle in-house.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.542
Thank you, Manish.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.420
-Up to your room.
-Okay.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.548
Couldn't you get into trouble
for not reporting this?

21:39.631 --> 21:41.967
Maybe, but I know how hard Devi works,

21:42.050 --> 21:45.804
and I don't want to mess up her future
because of one stupid mistake.

21:45.887 --> 21:49.516
Anyway, sorry about all this,
and I promise not to bother you again.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.226
Wait, please come inside.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.646
-Is this a trap?
-Please do it before she changes her mind.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.523
Okay. Whoa, you got a tight grip.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.858
Pardon me.

21:57.941 --> 21:59.401
Oh boy. Uh…

21:59.484 --> 22:01.361
Manish, I owe you an apology.

22:01.945 --> 22:05.365
I thought you were nothing more
than an immature, bumbling hooligan.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.160
-I mean, I'm a full-time teacher.
-Anyway, I was wrong.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.955
Despite what your haircut says about you,
you are a grown-up.

22:12.039 --> 22:15.459
You were tough on Devi today,
but you also protected her.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.377
That's what family does.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.922
So I'm happy for Kamala
to be with someone like you.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.677
Although, I would like you to learn
something more about your culture.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.347
Perhaps I can be your tutor.
Would you like that?

22:28.430 --> 22:30.724
He would love that.
Thank you, <i>Pati.</i>

22:30.807 --> 22:31.892
Good.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.936
Hey! Devi? Are you up there?

22:35.437 --> 22:37.647
Yeah. Come in.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.360
Hey, my mom asked me to bring takeout.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.196
While they were fighting
over spring rolls, I snuck upstairs.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.323
Damn. Well played, dude.

22:46.406 --> 22:49.159
If anyone deserves a "Damn.
Well played, dude," it's you.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.202
You clobbered us.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.329
Technically, yes.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.458
But I also may have cheated,
but in a way that didn't even help us,

22:56.541 --> 22:57.793
so you can't be that mad.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.127
Uh, you've lost me.

23:00.003 --> 23:03.799
-I'm the reason your binder went missing.
-Oh man. That was you?

23:03.882 --> 23:05.884
Parker fired one
of our paralegals for that.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.345
I'm sorry,
but how else are we supposed to compete

23:08.428 --> 23:11.056
with your paralegals
and the fricking <i>Jeopardy</i> computer?

23:12.474 --> 23:16.269
Yikes. Look, I'm not psyched
you stole our research, but frankly,

23:16.353 --> 23:19.773
I don't blame you guys for trying to give
yourselves an edge. That's what we do.

23:19.856 --> 23:23.819
Like, for instance,
we might take a normal desktop computer

23:23.902 --> 23:27.406
and put a screen saver on it
so it looks like the one from<i> Jeopardy</i>.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.991
No! I asked that computer
for an autograph.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.494
Look, I'll be honest.

23:33.161 --> 23:35.205
-I'm intimidated by you.
-Hmm?

23:35.288 --> 23:39.000
I don't think I've ever dated someone
as smart as me or maybe even smarter.

23:40.919 --> 23:41.837
I think I like it.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.256
Well, I like it too.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.758
-Being smarter than you.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.219
Devi,
why am I hearing voices up there?

23:49.302 --> 23:51.388
You better not be listening to a podcast!

23:52.013 --> 23:53.807
Okay, you got to get out of here.

23:53.890 --> 23:57.185
But maybe you could throw
a spring roll up the stairs?

23:57.936 --> 23:59.020
You got it.
