WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.459
Previously on "Graves"...

00:07.460 --> 00:09.999
Do what's right tomorrow
at the Treadwell parole thing.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.464
This guy's mother shouldn't die

00:11.465 --> 00:13.999
thinking that what he did
was in any way her fault.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.999
Martin Treadwell has
been granted a weekend furlough.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.999
I can't talk now, Jonathan.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.276
It'll only take a second.

00:20.277 --> 00:23.999
The RPAC conference is gonna
honor you, Mr. President.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.999
- What do you mean "family"?
- I'm pregnant.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.999
- Chuy, I'm out.
- Yeah?

00:29.000 --> 00:30.999
The best fucking agent that ever lived

00:31.000 --> 00:31.999
got you your own show.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.999
My mom always loved you, sir.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.999
She worked the Graves
For President office

00:36.000 --> 00:37.335
and worked door-to-door.

00:37.336 --> 00:38.999
You need to learn to pivot,

00:39.000 --> 00:40.999
direct him away from those cliffs

00:41.000 --> 00:42.999
he's so hell-bent on going over.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.589
The risks that I've taken
for you, the lies that I've told!

00:46.590 --> 00:48.040
I quit.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.999
Then I graduated summa cum laude,

00:51.000 --> 00:51.999
president of Hasty Pudding.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.999
Of course, you might have read that.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.530
The three and a half years
I spent at Harvard...

00:56.531 --> 00:57.999
I graduated a semester early...

00:58.000 --> 01:00.304
were truly invaluable.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.999
Harvard pretty boy, huh?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.713
I can't take credit for my looks, sir.

01:05.714 --> 01:08.000
What can I say,
God gave with both hands.

01:11.000 --> 01:11.999
I don't like you.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.999
I don't need you to like me, sir.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.710
My job is to assist.

01:15.711 --> 01:17.488
I do, however, have every confidence

01:17.489 --> 01:18.999
once you see what I bring to the table,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
you'll feel differently.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.999
No, no, I won't.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.999
Go easy on Eric, darling.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.999
He was Dick Cheney's
body man for three years

01:29.000 --> 01:31.999
and his recommendation for Eric
used the word "superstar".

01:32.000 --> 01:33.621
Thank you, ma'am.

01:33.622 --> 01:37.999
- Maggie, what's all this?
- You know what this is.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.999
My campaign and our appearances...

01:40.000 --> 01:40.999
you have to have your detail back.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.999
It's not up for discussion.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.999
And you know what? I have
some good news, honey.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.999
RPAC summit is inviting
you back again this year.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.999
And again, I'm not going to attend.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.999
Except, boss, this time
we need you to accept.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.999
They're giving you
the Reagan Award, sir,

01:56.000 --> 01:57.999
honoring your
transformational presidency.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.999
Who cares? They gave that award
to Dan Quayle, didn't they?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.999
Well, it's not about any award.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.497
I need you there. I'm gonna announce
my Senate candidacy at RPAC.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.999
Margaret Graves For Senate
is officially a go.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.999
The attendee list is huge.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.999
The Kochs, Adelson, Whitaker,
the Bushes, the governor...

02:19.000 --> 02:21.999
Okay, so because they're
honoring the former president,

02:22.000 --> 02:23.978
the summit is coming
here to Santa Fe. So...

02:23.979 --> 02:25.999
So they're basically
handing Margaret the platform.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.999
It's the party showing full support.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.999
It's a new chapter, angel.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.999
Oh, yes, yes. New chapter.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.999
I need to get out a bit.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.999
We'll start with Mr. Graves'
favorite spot for a bite.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.999
Plaza Coffee Shop, I believe.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.999
Then, depending on
your energy level, sir,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.999
a walk around the square
for some exercise...

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Do not hurt him.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.618 --> 03:42.999
Quickly, let's go.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.755
Hello, Mother.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
I've been waiting a long time for this.

04:14.766 --> 04:16.493
A long time.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.999
Let me explain something to you, okay?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.999
If Google has a right to read my emails

04:27.000 --> 04:28.999
and the NSA has a right
to tap my phones,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.999
then I feel like I should have a right
to walk around with my junk out

04:32.000 --> 04:33.999
because privacy is dead.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.999
Look, you and I got lucky
and fell out of a vagina

04:36.000 --> 04:37.999
on the right side of the border.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.999
That can't be the only way to decide

04:40.000 --> 04:40.999
who gets to be a citizen here.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.999
It's like people with fair trade coffee

04:44.000 --> 04:45.999
would rather fight a war on Christmas

04:46.000 --> 04:47.999
than a war on ISIS.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.340
It's like I always say,

04:49.341 --> 04:51.999
people are only as stupid as their vote.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.999
Medicare is no different
from hookers in Reno.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.999
They both want to suck you dry.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.999
I'm gonna come over there

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
and beat the truth into you.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.999
- You belong here, Jeremy.
- Oh, you're too kind.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.999
Your own half-hour show. Nothing fancy.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.487
We'll shoot it on the set at
our affiliate in Albuquerque.

05:13.488 --> 05:15.999
We guarantee you one show
per week, all right?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.340
That's Saturdays at 6:00 P.M.

05:17.341 --> 05:18.999
But, you know, the way you're
blowing up shit these days,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.999
we'll probably end up with three
or four prime-time slots.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.999
Just keep that shit
and the anger flowing.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.999
Yeah, well, you're not gonna
have to worry about that, Doug.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.297
I'm basically like a bottomless
well of acerbic observation.

05:30.298 --> 05:32.631
Also, just to be up front,

05:32.632 --> 05:34.999
you are gonna be asked
about your mother and father.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.999
I'm not gonna lie to you, I mean,
that's part of the whole appeal.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.999
That's part of your brand, you know?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.999
Bitter former first son giving us

05:42.000 --> 05:44.505
a warts-and-all look into
his family and the world.

05:45.439 --> 05:47.999
Hey, fuck 'em if they
can't take a joke, right?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.952
So, I'm out of here.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.479
I'm packing up and I'm
leaving next week.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.479
Where you going?

06:01.047 --> 06:02.871
Guess I'll know when I get there.

06:03.884 --> 06:06.479
I'm Eric, President
Graves' new assistant.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.479
Wait, so Isaiah's gone for good?

06:09.480 --> 06:11.480
Who? Never heard of him.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.479
Well, that sucks.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.965
I guess I shouldn't be
that surprised by it,

06:17.966 --> 06:20.479
but still.

06:21.417 --> 06:22.479
You upset about it?

06:22.480 --> 06:24.841
No, don't be ridiculous.

06:24.842 --> 06:28.480
I never wanted that kid.
Don't want this kid either.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.479
Hold on a sec.

06:31.204 --> 06:33.479
I've been reading your book.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.834
Sort of borrowed it from Isaiah,

06:35.835 --> 06:37.879
and I actually think I get it now.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.479
That kid was like your own
Frankenstein's monster.

06:40.480 --> 06:45.110
I mean, here you said, "Politics is
not much different than the movies.

06:45.135 --> 06:49.505
You and your spouse are cast in the roles
the electorate expect to see you in.

06:49.506 --> 06:51.745
Image is the beginning of your message.

06:51.746 --> 06:53.131
It's your brand."

06:53.132 --> 06:55.479
Unfortunate, but true.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.479
No, that's unfortunate. Period.

06:59.109 --> 07:02.072
Look, I've been loving
what you've been doing

07:02.221 --> 07:05.085
and it's been pretty fucking
amazing being a part of it,

07:05.974 --> 07:08.973
but, man, you've been so busy

07:08.998 --> 07:10.969
trying to fix the world
that you fucked up,

07:11.023 --> 07:13.022
you forgot that there
are people that live in it.

07:13.023 --> 07:15.620
So as far as Isaiah goes,
look back to who he was

07:15.621 --> 07:17.022
when he first started working for you.

07:17.023 --> 07:20.022
You broke him and broken people run.

07:20.023 --> 07:23.022
Of all the people that you feel
you may owe an apology to,

07:23.023 --> 07:25.022
he just might be at
the top of your list.

07:26.023 --> 07:28.023
It's been real.

07:32.023 --> 07:34.022
Interesting girl.

07:34.023 --> 07:37.617
I did my second dissertation on
variances of Stockholm syndrome.

07:37.618 --> 07:40.022
- You're fired.
- What?

07:40.023 --> 07:42.023
Fired.

07:45.023 --> 07:48.022
It's really happening, guys.

07:48.023 --> 07:50.022
You bet your Jimmy Choos it's happening.

07:50.023 --> 07:53.022
Now, if we're serious on making
the announcement at RPAC,

07:53.023 --> 07:55.022
there's very little time, not to mention

07:55.023 --> 07:58.022
the recent polls that just came
in are lower than expected.

07:58.023 --> 08:01.022
I don't understand. I've always
polled so well with the public.

08:01.023 --> 08:04.022
Of course you do. Don't let
this one bring you down.

08:04.023 --> 08:06.562
People are fickle. They just
want to get to know you again.

08:06.563 --> 08:07.850
I hope so.

08:07.851 --> 08:10.022
Well, we need to land on your
message, like, yesterday.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.022
"Moving America forward for New Mexico."

08:13.348 --> 08:15.022
What the hell does that mean?

08:15.023 --> 08:17.417
We tested it. People think
they know what it means.

08:17.693 --> 08:19.507
Don't forget your meeting
with Chet Whitaker

08:19.532 --> 08:21.022
downtown in a couple of hours.

08:21.023 --> 08:23.022
He's not a done deal...

08:23.023 --> 08:25.022
publically undecided as to
where he's putting his money.

08:25.023 --> 08:27.715
He's already met with Nash.
He wants to see you dance.

08:27.716 --> 08:31.022
Come on, Whitaker's an old
establishment money guy.

08:31.023 --> 08:33.392
He can't possibly take Nash seriously.

08:33.393 --> 08:37.022
Well, whether he does or not, he sees
you as the wife, not the candidate.

08:37.023 --> 08:39.022
And why aren't we discussing
Jonathan Dalton?

08:39.023 --> 08:41.022
There's no reason two fat cows
shouldn't be milked.

08:41.023 --> 08:45.599
Not yet. I just... we need to
be careful and considered.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.022
Anyway, welcome, y'all.

08:48.023 --> 08:51.022
Come on over here
and tell me your names.

08:51.023 --> 08:52.257
I'm Margaret.

09:06.607 --> 09:08.023
Oh, boy.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.022
God damn it.

09:28.023 --> 09:30.022
It's okay. I've got
another one in the oven.

09:33.023 --> 09:36.022
Hey, no worries. It's okay, babe.

09:36.023 --> 09:38.022
Yeah.

09:38.023 --> 09:40.022
Um, listen, babe,

09:40.023 --> 09:43.022
I love your positivity,

09:43.023 --> 09:47.022
but isn't there anything that would

09:47.023 --> 09:51.022
or could make you,
I don't know, unhappy?

09:51.023 --> 09:54.022
'Cause there's always
some bad with the good.

09:54.023 --> 09:57.022
You know, something
to bitch about, right?

09:57.023 --> 09:59.022
No, not really.

10:01.023 --> 10:03.023
Excuse me.

10:11.023 --> 10:13.022
- Hey, bro.
- False alarm.

10:13.372 --> 10:15.022
Chuy!

10:15.023 --> 10:18.022
Oh, my gosh. What a surprise!

10:18.023 --> 10:21.022
Oh, are you gonna stay for dinner?

10:21.023 --> 10:23.022
Company! I love it.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.022
Oh!

10:25.023 --> 10:28.022
And we might be able to
feed you like proper hosts.

10:28.023 --> 10:30.355
Say a little prayer.

10:43.023 --> 10:46.022
Holy shit.

10:46.023 --> 10:47.023
Hey, babe.

11:15.023 --> 11:17.311
I don't believe it.

11:18.023 --> 11:20.022
You... well, you're...

11:20.023 --> 11:22.022
Yes, Mrs. Miller, I'm...

11:22.023 --> 11:24.022
No, you don't have to say who you are.

11:24.023 --> 11:25.022
I know who you are.

11:25.023 --> 11:27.023
Oh, my God.

11:31.543 --> 11:33.542
Unbelievable.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.750
Nobody's gonna goddamn believe this.

11:40.769 --> 11:42.022
Sorry.

11:42.023 --> 11:44.022
Listen, my accountant talked to me

11:44.023 --> 11:48.022
and he said that Isaiah had asked him

11:48.023 --> 11:50.022
to send his check here.

11:50.023 --> 11:51.741
So, what, you brought it yourself?

11:51.781 --> 11:55.022
I had to come over to Prescott
anyway to talk with the governor.

11:55.023 --> 11:57.022
Of course, the governor.
'Cause you're you.

11:57.023 --> 12:01.022
Wow, okay. So, this is
where I raised Isaiah.

12:01.023 --> 12:04.022
- Uh-huh.
- And these are pictures of him here.

12:04.023 --> 12:07.022
- Yeah.
- I was in labor for 40 frickin' hours.

12:07.023 --> 12:09.022
His head was as big as a kettlebell.

12:09.023 --> 12:11.022
- Ouch.
- Yes.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.742
Would you like to sit and have a Fresca?

12:12.743 --> 12:16.022
- Yes. Sure. Fine.
- You're so handsome.

12:16.023 --> 12:18.599
Um, just sit... you can sit there.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.022
- Thank you.
- Okay.

12:20.023 --> 12:22.525
Comfortable? There.

12:23.622 --> 12:25.022
You know, I thought 1,000 times

12:25.023 --> 12:27.022
about what I would say to you

12:27.023 --> 12:29.022
if I ever got the chance.

12:29.023 --> 12:31.022
You know, I was in my twenties
when you first ran for president.

12:31.023 --> 12:35.022
- Oh.
- And then I heard you speak.

12:35.023 --> 12:38.022
The moment I heard you speak, I knew.

12:38.023 --> 12:41.022
I understood what you stood for,

12:41.023 --> 12:43.022
what you were gonna do for us.

12:43.023 --> 12:47.022
So that's when I knew I had
to help spread your word.

12:47.561 --> 12:50.022
You know? Presidents matter.

12:50.023 --> 12:53.022
It's what I always tell Isaiah.
Presidents, they matter.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.458
Absolutely.

12:55.023 --> 12:58.022
Sorry, too much information.

12:58.023 --> 12:59.486
What the hell?

12:59.487 --> 13:02.022
Oh, okay.

13:02.023 --> 13:04.399
- So let me have it.
- I'm sorry?

13:04.424 --> 13:06.022
My kid is...

13:06.023 --> 13:08.022
- he's professional to a fault.
- Mm-hmm.

13:08.023 --> 13:12.022
Comes home from the job
that I dreamt for him

13:12.023 --> 13:13.407
since before he was born

13:13.408 --> 13:16.022
without that job and doesn't say why.

13:16.023 --> 13:18.022
It's complicated.

13:18.023 --> 13:22.229
I mean, Isaiah has really high values.

13:23.023 --> 13:28.022
He also has a lot of unmet expectations.

13:28.023 --> 13:29.278
You know, President,

13:30.023 --> 13:33.668
I've known some real
shitty men in my life.

13:33.693 --> 13:35.693
All of them, actually.

13:37.023 --> 13:38.640
So you see, that's why...

13:38.665 --> 13:40.663
that's why I felt real lucky

13:41.876 --> 13:46.876
when my kid had someone
like you to look up to.

13:54.023 --> 13:56.022
- I should go.
- Oh, don't go.

13:56.023 --> 13:58.022
I'm sorry. I talked this whole time.

13:58.023 --> 14:00.022
Can I get you something to eat?
Are you hungry?

14:00.023 --> 14:02.022
No, no, no, I'm fine.

14:02.023 --> 14:03.649
Yeah, you want to know where he is.

14:11.023 --> 14:13.022
- Tasha?
- No way.

14:13.023 --> 14:15.022
Is it okay that I'm calling?

14:15.023 --> 14:18.022
Totally. I'm just surprised.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.022
I mean, good surprised. I just...

14:21.023 --> 14:24.550
don't usually hear from my one-night
mental hospital stands again.

14:24.551 --> 14:27.022
I know, it's so crazy.
Even without all the lithium,

14:27.023 --> 14:29.022
I can't stop thinking about you.
I don't know what to say.

14:29.023 --> 14:31.022
Conversely, I like being thought of.

14:31.023 --> 14:34.022
I just had this insane morning.

14:34.023 --> 14:36.728
I just got off a plane and the most
amazing fucking thing happened.

14:36.753 --> 14:40.022
I got offered a job.
Don't be weirded out, okay?

14:40.023 --> 14:42.022
Trust me, I don't weird out easily.

14:42.023 --> 14:44.022
It's just that you were the
first person I wanted to call

14:44.023 --> 14:47.022
when I got out of the meeting,
which is kind of a big deal for me

14:47.023 --> 14:51.022
since I haven't wanted to share
anything with anyone ever.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.022
So...

14:52.023 --> 14:54.022
- Wait, can you hold on just one second?
- Yeah.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.355
Liv?

14:56.023 --> 14:58.022
I can't move, Jeremy.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.022
I can't leave this room maybe ever.

15:00.023 --> 15:03.022
What the fuck are you talking about?

15:03.023 --> 15:04.458
Jeremy.

15:06.889 --> 15:07.888
Help.

15:08.023 --> 15:10.022
Olivia, where the fuck are you?

15:11.023 --> 15:14.022
The Yuletide candle line. Heaven.

15:14.023 --> 15:17.466
You know, the dripless tapered sugar
cookie candle's our best seller?

15:17.467 --> 15:20.022
It's just like sitting
in Grandma's kitchen.

15:20.023 --> 15:22.022
All right, you have a wonderful day

15:22.023 --> 15:24.415
and just remember, if you ain't buying,

15:24.416 --> 15:26.023
Santa's crying.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.802
You're screwed.

15:31.023 --> 15:33.022
Very funny.

15:33.023 --> 15:35.750
Esther, I'm gonna take
my break a little early, okay?

15:35.775 --> 15:38.022
Take the hat off, will you, please?

15:38.023 --> 15:40.280
This is not happening.

15:42.023 --> 15:44.405
A year and change
from now you're in Washington.

15:44.406 --> 15:47.022
What's your vision?

15:47.023 --> 15:50.022
I'd like to give New Mexicans
back a sense of pride.

15:50.023 --> 15:52.022
Pride of ownership in their lives.

15:52.023 --> 15:54.022
Get them back working.

15:54.023 --> 15:56.022
Give them incentives to dream bigger

15:56.023 --> 15:57.716
for themselves and their children.

15:57.717 --> 16:01.470
Look, Margaret, this is what I need.

16:01.495 --> 16:04.022
I've got three factories in Vietnam.

16:04.023 --> 16:06.022
The tariffs are busting my ass.

16:06.023 --> 16:08.022
I need a better trade deal.

16:08.023 --> 16:11.022
I own mines in North Dakota and...

16:11.023 --> 16:13.022
With all due respect, Mr. Whitaker,

16:13.023 --> 16:16.022
I wouldn't be running in order
to be your errand girl.

16:16.023 --> 16:19.022
Look, I'm not asking you
to compromise your ideals.

16:19.023 --> 16:21.508
Your opponent, Thomas Nash,

16:21.509 --> 16:25.022
he will, but I'm gonna
pay to have your ear.

16:25.023 --> 16:27.739
Well, I'm not too sure
I'm interested, Mr. Whitaker,

16:27.740 --> 16:31.022
because this run,
it's not about all that.

16:31.023 --> 16:34.022
It's about me for once. My ideas.

16:34.023 --> 16:38.022
Things I have to say since
before I even met Richard.

16:38.023 --> 16:40.022
Don't be coy with me, Margaret.

16:40.299 --> 16:43.022
You've watched this game
played long enough.

16:43.023 --> 16:44.457
You know how this works.

16:48.023 --> 16:50.521
Thank you for letting me
bend your ear, Mr. Whitaker.

16:50.522 --> 16:54.023
I appreciate your time.
I have to think about this.

17:00.688 --> 17:02.289
What are you doing here?

17:02.676 --> 17:04.021
I mean, I know I left in a hurry

17:04.022 --> 17:06.021
without the prerequisite
two weeks' notice,

17:06.022 --> 17:10.022
but I seriously didn't think
I could stand one more day.

17:13.022 --> 17:18.021
Sammy wanted me to give you this
autobiography she borrowed.

17:18.022 --> 17:21.627
There's also your last check in there.

17:22.778 --> 17:26.021
The US Postal Service
stop operating in Arizona?

17:26.022 --> 17:28.021
Is that what you call gratitude?

17:28.022 --> 17:31.022
I mean, God damn it,
Isaiah, I'm standing here

17:31.023 --> 17:32.623
in the middle of this
fucking parking lot,

17:32.624 --> 17:35.594
and I don't stand in the
middle of parking lots.

17:37.876 --> 17:39.306
You know what?

17:40.170 --> 17:42.023
Fuck this.

17:44.023 --> 17:45.464
No, no, wait. Wait, sir.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.088
It's just... I just...

17:49.729 --> 17:51.728
I don't know.

17:52.023 --> 17:53.684
Well, what's this?

17:53.685 --> 17:55.022
It's part-time.

17:55.023 --> 17:57.022
I have a meeting with
John McCain's office

17:57.023 --> 17:58.463
later today, actually,

17:58.464 --> 18:00.022
before everyone shuts
down for the holiday.

18:00.023 --> 18:01.594
McCain?

18:03.023 --> 18:05.022
Is that your version of a good move?

18:05.023 --> 18:07.022
Yes, sir, it is.

18:07.023 --> 18:08.531
He's still very relevant,

18:08.532 --> 18:11.022
and in my mind he embraces
a brand of conservatism

18:11.023 --> 18:13.022
that I really subscribe to.

18:13.023 --> 18:14.351
It's very sensible.

18:14.376 --> 18:17.793
You know that book you love so much?

18:17.818 --> 18:21.817
There's a story that I didn't include.

18:21.842 --> 18:24.841
It's when I was a young kid.

18:24.866 --> 18:26.224
Really a boy.

18:26.249 --> 18:29.826
I went riding one night on my horse.

18:31.023 --> 18:33.578
She was my first horse. A mare.

18:34.023 --> 18:37.022
She was beautiful.
I raised her from a colt.

18:37.023 --> 18:40.022
We were riding down a dry creek bed

18:40.023 --> 18:41.706
and she stumbled.

18:41.731 --> 18:43.730
I thought she broke her leg.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.022
I jumped off. I looked at her.

18:46.023 --> 18:48.051
Ankle was twisted.

18:48.896 --> 18:50.895
I wanted to save her.

18:51.409 --> 18:55.022
So we walked back to the ranch.

18:55.023 --> 18:57.022
She limped all the way.

18:57.023 --> 18:59.022
I wanted to put her in the stall

18:59.023 --> 19:03.022
and raise her up to get the
weight off that foot to help her,

19:03.552 --> 19:06.023
but my dad heard us come in.

19:06.809 --> 19:08.808
He came to the barn,

19:09.023 --> 19:11.282
took one look at that ankle,

19:12.023 --> 19:13.457
shot her.

19:14.881 --> 19:17.282
Put her out of her misery.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.023
I couldn't save her.

19:22.428 --> 19:25.022
That was the first time I really knew

19:25.023 --> 19:28.023
that I had let somebody down.

19:29.623 --> 19:30.622
Your father.

19:31.473 --> 19:35.022
No. Jesus! The horse!

19:35.023 --> 19:37.022
Oh, right, yeah, of course. The horse.

19:37.023 --> 19:40.022
Oh, Isaiah.

19:40.574 --> 19:43.023
God, you're a thrill a minute.

19:45.023 --> 19:50.023
Sometimes, Isaiah,
the wounds are all we are.

19:53.023 --> 19:55.023
Don't make me yours.

19:58.576 --> 19:59.575
You know, kid,

20:00.527 --> 20:03.023
I didn't write the world.

20:14.023 --> 20:16.023
Oh, fuck!

20:17.447 --> 20:19.022
Liv? Olivia!

20:19.023 --> 20:21.023
I'm in here.

20:22.531 --> 20:24.023
Shit.

20:26.842 --> 20:28.022
I didn't burn the chicken.

20:28.548 --> 20:31.602
What? Okay, great.
Yeah, I'm proud of you.

20:31.603 --> 20:33.022
- Are you hurt?
- No.

20:33.023 --> 20:36.022
- What the fuck?
- I didn't burn the chicken.

20:36.023 --> 20:39.022
Fuck the chicken! There's a
dead man in the living room!

20:39.023 --> 20:41.022
Okay, I...

20:41.023 --> 20:42.567
I've got to get you out of here.

20:42.568 --> 20:44.022
I've got to make it look
like you were never here.

20:44.023 --> 20:46.587
So you just...
you just stay there, okay?

20:46.588 --> 20:49.867
And give me the mitts.
Give me the mitts.

20:51.023 --> 20:53.023
- Give me the other mitt!
- Okay, I'm sorry!

20:56.023 --> 20:58.710
You owe me so fucking big for this.

21:00.023 --> 21:03.022
- I got the bag. Did you touch anything?
- Everything.

21:09.023 --> 21:12.022
All right, let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Get the chicken.

21:12.023 --> 21:13.022
You're doing great. We got to go.

21:13.023 --> 21:16.022
Wait. Wait, wait. His phone.

21:19.023 --> 21:21.022
Jeremy.

21:21.023 --> 21:24.023
I know, but sometimes our best
work never gets saved.

21:33.347 --> 21:36.022
Thank you so much for taking
the time, Mr. Spindell.

21:36.023 --> 21:39.664
It's all good. Apologies for
Senator McCain not being here,

21:39.665 --> 21:41.517
but, you know, last minute shit.

21:41.518 --> 21:43.424
Oh, yeah, of course.
I would never expect...

21:43.425 --> 21:46.022
Well, anyway, since we've all got
lives, I'll make this quick.

21:46.023 --> 21:50.022
The senator received a phone call from
Richard Graves about an hour ago.

21:50.430 --> 21:52.022
Oh?

21:52.023 --> 21:54.537
Yeah, the former president gave you
a pretty stellar recommendation.

21:54.538 --> 21:58.022
Said that the senator
should just hire you

21:58.023 --> 21:59.558
because he will not find someone better.

21:59.583 --> 22:02.022
Said you're a superstar.

22:02.023 --> 22:04.599
And then he added something about
interviews being for pussies.

22:04.624 --> 22:05.434
I know.

22:05.459 --> 22:08.047
Anyway, so, the job's yours
if you want it.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.023
Okay, thank you.

22:18.023 --> 22:19.275
I got you.

22:20.023 --> 22:23.023
It's just you and me. I got you, okay?

22:24.842 --> 22:26.842
Oh, boy.

22:45.023 --> 22:47.023
Here we go.

22:50.023 --> 22:51.023
Oh, boy. Here we go.

22:54.269 --> 22:56.022
- Hey.
- Yeah?

22:56.360 --> 22:58.163
Will you stay with me?

22:58.652 --> 23:00.022
My meds are about to kick in.

23:00.023 --> 23:02.534
Yeah, sure. You just rest, okay?

23:02.535 --> 23:04.022
I'm gonna be right over there, okay?

23:04.023 --> 23:06.022
Here's your bear thing.

23:06.023 --> 23:08.023
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:43.023 --> 23:45.439
Hey, Milly. Milly.

23:46.023 --> 23:48.022
Is Samantha gone for the night?

23:48.023 --> 23:50.731
She quit, hon. This was her last day.

23:50.732 --> 23:52.022
Anything besides coffee?

23:52.023 --> 23:54.023
No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

24:21.023 --> 24:23.022
What the hell are you doing here?

24:23.023 --> 24:28.022
Well, you forgot to sign my check, sir.

24:28.023 --> 24:30.023
It's unsigned.

24:33.877 --> 24:37.876
Look, I know you called Senator McCain.

24:38.023 --> 24:41.022
And the whole time
I was in that interview,

24:41.023 --> 24:44.022
I was just thinking is sensible

24:44.023 --> 24:46.371
really the right fit for me anymore?

24:46.396 --> 24:49.022
I mean, what you said
about not writing the world

24:49.023 --> 24:50.481
and all we've been through together?

24:50.506 --> 24:53.022
I mean, honestly, I've done more
living in the last few months...

24:53.023 --> 24:55.022
Jesus, will you get to the point?

24:55.023 --> 24:57.782
Just ask for your job back already.

24:57.783 --> 24:59.022
I'd like to come back.

24:59.023 --> 25:01.848
I mean, I know I owe
Mrs. Graves an apology,

25:01.849 --> 25:04.022
and I understand if it's too late, sir,

25:04.023 --> 25:08.022
but if there could be just a
little less yelling in general,

25:08.023 --> 25:09.426
fewer attacks on my manhood,

25:09.427 --> 25:11.079
maybe a smidgen of respect?

25:11.537 --> 25:13.536
That's what I'm trying to teach you.

25:13.943 --> 25:16.532
Stand up, be a man.

25:16.656 --> 25:17.966
- Okay?
- Okay.

25:18.023 --> 25:22.022
So, get the bill and we'll
get the hell out of here.

25:22.023 --> 25:23.687
Yes, sir.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.022
Very good. Hello.

25:26.023 --> 25:28.022
I'm Thomas Nash.

25:28.023 --> 25:32.127
You might know me as New Mexico's
number one veterinarian.

25:32.152 --> 25:35.818
Now I want to turn my attention
to my two-legged friends.

25:35.843 --> 25:37.553
That's you, New Mexico.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.365
Because I know what you need...

25:39.432 --> 25:42.022
a real conservative who will cut taxes,

25:42.023 --> 25:45.736
rein in spending,
protect religious freedom

25:45.737 --> 25:49.022
by pushing to defund Planned Parenthood,

25:49.023 --> 25:50.408
and secure our border.

25:50.409 --> 25:52.022
Do the right thing, friends,

25:52.023 --> 25:55.022
and vote Thomas Nash for Senate.

25:55.772 --> 25:59.022
Don't let this little guy down, okay?

26:03.023 --> 26:05.022
I don't know what to tell you, Margaret.

26:05.023 --> 26:07.022
The man saves puppies.

26:07.023 --> 26:09.022
The man is an oil slick, Chet.

26:09.023 --> 26:11.022
He will promise you the sun,
moon, and the stars,

26:11.023 --> 26:13.022
and then he'll slide
right out from under you,

26:13.023 --> 26:16.022
leaving you covered in the
muck of his terrible policies.

26:16.023 --> 26:19.022
Now, I won't make empty promises to you

26:19.023 --> 26:21.022
because that's not
the way I do business,

26:21.023 --> 26:25.022
but my door will always be open if
and when you'd like to be heard.

26:25.023 --> 26:28.023
So, you want my support?

26:30.023 --> 26:33.022
No, darlin', I want your fucking check.

26:46.023 --> 26:48.022
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.022
Very nice, sweetheart.

26:50.023 --> 26:52.022
Mrs. Graves, before we sit down,

26:52.023 --> 26:55.696
I just want to apologize
for the other evening.

26:55.721 --> 26:57.720
Darlin', we're all pivoting.

26:58.023 --> 27:00.723
Glad you're here. Have a seat.

27:00.748 --> 27:02.245
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

27:15.023 --> 27:17.022
Oh, Ramona, what a beautiful table.

27:17.023 --> 27:19.022
Thank you, Mrs. Graves.

27:19.023 --> 27:21.022
I think you have one
extra place setting.

27:21.023 --> 27:23.023
Livy's not coming tonight.

27:28.023 --> 27:29.022
Olivia?

27:29.023 --> 27:32.219
I'm so happy you're here.

27:32.244 --> 27:34.014
What happened to...

27:34.330 --> 27:35.619
Oh, it didn't work out.

27:35.644 --> 27:37.584
Well, I'm starving. Let's have a seat.

27:53.023 --> 27:55.022
I'm glad we're all here.

27:55.023 --> 27:57.022
And I want you to know

27:57.023 --> 28:00.022
that I love each and every one of you.

28:00.023 --> 28:01.615
I love you.

28:14.341 --> 28:16.022
All right, everybody, cheers.

28:16.023 --> 28:18.022
Cheers.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.822
Ah!

28:51.823 --> 28:52.822
Isaiah Miller.

28:52.823 --> 28:55.822
Hey, this is Erin York with "USA Today."

28:55.823 --> 28:59.822
We met a little while ago at that
Chamber of Commerce reception in DC.

28:59.823 --> 29:01.822
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember. Hi, Erin.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.822
We'd love to give
former President Graves

29:03.823 --> 29:06.382
the opportunity to comment
on a story we're writing.

29:06.383 --> 29:07.822
Okay.

29:07.823 --> 29:10.822
Regarding the affair between
his wife Margaret Graves

29:10.823 --> 29:12.823
and Jonathon Dalton when she
was in the White House.

29:13.823 --> 29:14.823
What?

29:15.305 --> 29:21.192
