HEY, SWEETHEART.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

00:03.937 --> 00:05.606
(Casey)
I HAD A ROUGH DAY
HERE IN HAITI.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.341
I WAS WALKING
DOWN THE STREET,

00:07.375 --> 00:09.310
AND A BABY BAT
FLEW INTO MY MOUTH.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.512
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
FOR YOU

00:11.545 --> 00:13.314
THAT I PLANNED
A VERY SEXY CHAT TONIGHT.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.283
YOU LIKE THE MOVIE
VARSITY BLUES, RIGHT?

00:15.316 --> 00:16.484
I'M AN AMERICAN MALE

00:16.517 --> 00:18.752
BETWEEN THE AGE
OF 6 AND 93, YEAH.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.621
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE WHIPPED CREAM BIKINI?

00:20.654 --> 00:23.157
I REMEMBER IT.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.292
OH. OH!

00:24.325 --> 00:25.826
VERY COOL, I SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

00:25.859 --> 00:29.297
WELL, I'M GONNA GO GET PREPARED.
SEE YOU SOON.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.165
DON'T FORGET
THE CHERRIES.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.200
BABE?

00:32.233 --> 00:33.101
YEAH?

00:33.134 --> 00:34.602
ARE YOU READY
TO GET YOUR MIND BLOWN?

00:34.635 --> 00:36.104
BLOW IT.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.172
READY OR NOT,
HERE I COME.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.174
OH!

00:40.208 --> 00:41.575
WHAT'S UP
WITH THE ONE-PIECE?

00:41.609 --> 00:42.576
HMM?

00:42.610 --> 00:44.312
IT'S JUST PRETTY MODEST,

00:44.345 --> 00:45.813
BABE, I STARTED
WITH A STRING BIKINI,

00:45.846 --> 00:47.515
BUT I THOUGHT THAT
LOOKED SKANKY, OKAY?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.183
YEAH, THE WHOLE POINT
IS BE SKANKY.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.751
WELL, I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHO'S WATCHING THIS, YOU KNOW,

00:50.784 --> 00:53.787
THE NSA, THAT HOT
EDWARD SNOWDEN GUY.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.356
I DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE ON, LIKE, WIKILEAKS.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.657
IT JUST KINDA LOOKS
LIKE A BATHING SUIT

00:56.690 --> 00:57.658
MY GRANDMA MIGHT WEAR.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.593
GRANDMA WITH BENEFITS,
MAYBE?

00:59.627 --> 01:02.296
YOU ARE CONFUSING
MY "B" RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

01:02.330 --> 01:03.697
WELL, THIS IS NOT GONNA
CONFUSE YOUR "B."

01:03.731 --> 01:05.699
THE CROTCH
IS MADE OUT OF TAFFY.

01:05.733 --> 01:06.934
OKAY.

01:06.967 --> 01:09.203

WHERE I HID THE GUMMY BEAR.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.539
GIRL, YOU SURE

01:11.572 --> 01:13.507

01:47.208 --> 01:48.809

01:48.842 --> 01:51.245

MY NAME IS DR. L.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.414
BIG L BROUGHT DOUGHNUTS

01:53.447 --> 01:54.915
NOPE, NOT BIG L.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.451
I'M A TINY, DAINTY WOMAN,

02:03.291 --> 02:04.858

02:11.499 --> 02:13.267

02:13.301 --> 02:14.835
OR YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU COULD DO IT BY YOURSELF,

02:14.868 --> 02:17.438
AND THEN I COULD GO REST,
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY

02:17.471 --> 02:19.773
HURT MY TRICEP YESTERDAY
TRYING TO CUT A STEAK.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.875
WHY AM I GETTING THE STUFF

02:21.909 --> 02:23.811
LOOK,

AN AWESOME OFFICE,

02:27.348 --> 02:29.317
EXCEPT THIS ONE IS MINE.
OKAY.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.818
ALL RIGHT,
LET ME JUST CHECK SOMETHING.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.486
THANK YOU SO--
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.488
I REALLY WANT
TO HELP YOU.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.590
OH, SHOOT!

02:36.624 --> 02:39.260
I AM BUSY ALL DAY
NOT GIVING A DAMN!

02:39.293 --> 02:42.296
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M JUST BOOKED ALL WEEK

02:42.330 --> 02:44.232
NOT CARING ABOUT THIS.
[chuckles]

02:44.265 --> 02:47.435
YEAH, THAT JUST CONTINUES
ALL THE WAY TO 2060.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.436
THAT'S REALLY CUTE.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.603
HERE'S A TIP, THOUGH.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.671
DON'T TRY TO OUT-CUTE

02:50.704 --> 02:51.805
THE CUTEST PERSON
IN THIS OFFICE.

02:51.839 --> 02:55.343
ARE YOU CUTER THAN THIS?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.845
I WUV HUGS.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.382
I HATED THAT.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.616
I HATED THAT.
THAT WAS DISGUSTING.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.285
JEREMY?
JEREMY.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.220
YOU ARE MANAGING PARTNER,
WHICH UNTIL THIS MOMENT,

03:06.254 --> 03:07.221
I DID NOT
CARE ABOUT AT ALL.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.522
GOOD MORNING.

GOOD MORNING,

03:13.026 --> 03:14.295
NO, NOPE.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.930
WHY WOULD I FIRE THE BEST THING
TO EVER HAPPEN TO THIS PRACTICE?

03:16.964 --> 03:20.468
OKAY, HE STOLE MY OFFICE,
AND HE MADE ME FEEL UNCOOL.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.302
WELL,
THAT'S HIS OFFICE NOW.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.403
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
GONE A YEAR,

03:22.436 --> 03:24.972
BUT YOU GOT BACK FROM CLUB MED
EIGHT MONTHS EARLY.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.007
IT WAS A SERVICE TRIP
TO THE WORST PLACE IN THE WORLD.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.942
THE WORST PLACE IN THE WORLD
IS FENWAY PARK.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.011
LOOK, I LET PAUL
MOVE INTO MY APARTMENT

03:31.044 --> 03:32.580
WHEN CHRISTINA AND I
MOVED TO JERSEY,

03:32.613 --> 03:33.814
BUT NOW WE'RE BROKEN UP.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.549
YOU DON'T SEE ME
ASKING FOR MY APARTMENT BACK.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.717
YOU SHOULD!

03:36.750 --> 03:38.686
HE'S PROBABLY HAVING
COCAINE SNOWBALL PARTIES

03:38.719 --> 03:39.953
WITH MODELS IN THERE.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.855
UGH!
THE REASON I HIRED PAUL

03:41.889 --> 03:44.892
IS BECAUSE HE'S A GOOD DOCTOR
AND THE PATIENTS ALL LOVE HIM.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.695
HE WAS FEATURED ON THE COVER
OF NEW YORK MAGAZINE.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.562
SO WHAT?

03:48.596 --> 03:50.264
I WAS PROFILED

03:50.298 --> 03:51.699

HE COSIGNED YOUR LOAN?

04:02.410 --> 04:03.944
THAT'S ENOUGH, OKAY?

04:03.977 --> 04:05.546
YOU DID NOT EVEN
LOOK UP FROM YOUR SUDOKU

04:05.579 --> 04:06.547
WHEN I WENT TO HAITI.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.382
DR. L,
IT'S THE HOSPITAL.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.617
EVA CASTILLO

04:11.051 --> 04:13.053

SHE'S MY PATIENT.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.422

TA-DA.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.582

04:41.615 --> 04:44.918

WHERE OLD COMPUTERS GO TO DIE.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.388
NO, THIS IS A FIXER-UPPER

04:47.421 --> 04:49.490

04:52.025 --> 04:54.395
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS, YOU
DON'T HAVE ANY AT THE MOMENT.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.864

05:11.612 --> 05:12.780
NO, I'M NOT DOING THAT.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.716
I'M GONNA RUN TO THE POST OFFICE
BY MYSELF.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.885
I'M GONNA DO MY OWN BUSINESS,

SOMETIMES, I WILL MAIL
AN EMPTY BOX JUST TO SEE HER,

05:31.098 --> 05:33.066

I'M IN LOVE WITH HER.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.514
THIS IS CLEARLY

JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE WIVES

06:38.799 --> 06:40.734

15:19.619 --> 15:21.088
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.489
THIS SECRET,
IT'S A REAL SECRET.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.656
IT'S NOT LIKE
ONE OF THOSE LAME SECRETS

15:23.690 --> 15:24.724
YOU WERE TELLING ME
LAST NIGHT.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.026
WAIT, I DIDN'T TELL YOU
THAT I SLEPT

15:26.059 --> 15:27.594
WITH HILLARY CLINTON,
DID I?

15:27.627 --> 15:28.628
DID YOU?

15:28.661 --> 15:30.330
NO!

15:30.363 --> 15:33.300
HILLARY IS HAPPILY MARRIED
TO HER HUSBAND, BILL CLINTON.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.405
(Danny)
HEY.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.439
DANNY.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.974
YOU AND ME GOT
A PROBLEM, BUDDY.

15:41.008 --> 15:41.841
WE DO?

15:41.874 --> 15:44.044
IF YOU THREW UP
ON MY COUCH LAST NIGHT,

15:44.077 --> 15:45.345
'CAUSE YOU WERE WASTED.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.679
YEAH.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.415

15:55.288 --> 15:56.256
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.324
IT'S GONNA HELP
WITH THE HANGOVER.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.758
IT'S A CASTELLANO SPECIAL
SECRET.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.460
I DON'T DO THIS FOR EVERYONE.
YOU'RE FAMILY NOW.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.362
THIS IS THE SECRET
BREAKFAST SANDWICH.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.031
OKAY.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.299
YOU KNOW WHAT, I--

16:08.368 --> 16:10.370
AH, YOU QUIT.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.340
I-I QUIT THE PRACTICE.
I, UH--

16:13.373 --> 16:17.177
I JOINED THE ARMY,
AND I CAN'T WORK THERE

16:17.210 --> 16:18.411
AND WORK HERE
AT THE SAME TIME, SO--

16:18.445 --> 16:19.346
YOU JOINED THE ARMY?

16:19.379 --> 16:21.348
YEAH, YEAH.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.119
[clears throat]
HOLD ON A SEC.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.722
WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

16:29.756 --> 16:31.391
I'M WALKING HIM TO THE ARMY.
WHA--YEAH.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.160
(Paul)
EVERYTHING'S NORMAL.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.061
EVERYTHING'S NORMAL?

16:34.094 --> 16:36.263
THIS IS A PATRIOT,
AND HE NEEDS TO LEAVE.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.431
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO THE TWO OF YOU IN PRIVATE.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.466
RIGHT NOW.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.401
OKAY.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.669
(Danny)
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.338
YOU TOOK HIM TO THE BAR,
YOU GOT HIM DRUNK,

16:45.372 --> 16:46.273
HIS INHIBITIONS
WENT DOWN...

16:46.306 --> 16:47.274
THAT'S TRUE.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.741
AND YOU HAD SEX
WITH HIM.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.377
I'M SORRY.
WHA--

16:50.410 --> 16:51.778
YOU HAD SEX WITH PAUL.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.281
SEX WITH MINDY?
NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.449
RIGHT?
OH. [laughs]

16:56.483 --> 16:57.617
NO.
YEAH.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.119
CAUGHT YOU.
WAS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.287
IT WAS OBVIOUS.
OH!

17:00.320 --> 17:01.654
DANNY, YOU GOT US.
YUP.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.190
I HAD SEX WITH MINDY.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.291
G--

17:04.324 --> 17:06.426
WE--WE MADE LOVE
LAST NIGHT.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.360
MADE LO--
OKAY, THAT'S--

17:07.394 --> 17:08.828
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
THAT'S--

17:08.861 --> 17:12.165
BUT DON'T BLAME HER.
I WAS SO WASTED.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.433
I MEAN, NORMALLY,
I WOULD NEVER--

17:13.466 --> 17:15.168
I GET IT.
NO, IT SUCKS FOR ME,

17:15.202 --> 17:16.303
'CAUSE HE GAVE ME HPV.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.370
WELL,
EVERYONE HAS HPV.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.471
75% OF PEOPLE HAVE IT.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.474
YOU'RE ENGAGED, MINDY!
YOU'RE ENGAGED.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.410
EVERYONE'S MAKING FUN
OF MY SO-CALLED LOSER FRIENDS.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.178
AT LEAST THEY KNOW TO LOOK OUT
FOR A WOMAN LIKE YOU.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.180
THEY KNOW TO WATCH OUT.
WELL, DANNY, COME ON.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.415
EX-SQUEEZE ME?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.383
OKAY, THERE'S A WORD
FOR WOMEN LIKE YOU, RIGHT?

17:30.417 --> 17:32.119
NO, WE DON'T--
A WORD WOULD DESCRIBE A WOMAN

17:32.152 --> 17:33.320
YOU'D SAY OF A LOOSE--
OH, DON'T YOU EVEN DARE.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.354
DANNY, WE DON'T NEED
TO NAME-CALL, OKAY?

17:34.387 --> 17:35.422
LOOSE QUALITY
IN A SEXUAL FASHION.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.457
NO, NAME-CALLING, MAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

17:37.490 --> 17:38.591
DANNY, NO, NO, NO!
PLEASE, SAY IT.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.759
YOU ARE A--
I DARE YOU TO SAY--

17:39.792 --> 17:40.860
ALL RIGHT,
I SLEPT WITH CHRISTINA.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.162
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.396
I DIDN'T SLEEP WITH MINDY.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.533
I GOT DRUNK, SHE SHOWED UP,
AND I HAD SEX WITH CHRISTINA.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.336
W--
CHRISTINA?

17:49.369 --> 17:51.404
I'M SORRY.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.240
CHRISTINA CHRISTINA?

17:53.273 --> 17:54.241
THAT ONE, YEAH.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.375
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:55.408 --> 17:57.377
ABSOLUTELY.
OKAY.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.411
OH!
OH, MY GOD!

18:02.582 --> 18:03.550
YOU WANNA SEE AN ANIMAL? I'LL
SHOW YOU AN ANIMAL RIGHT NOW.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.617
OKAY, NOW, WE'RE GOING!
OH!

18:04.651 --> 18:06.353
COME HERE, COME HERE!
COME HERE!

18:06.386 --> 18:07.687
OKAY.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

18:07.720 --> 18:09.189
GET HIM!
WATCH HIM! WATCH HIM!

18:09.222 --> 18:10.457
WHAT IS GOING ON?
I DON'T WANT TO GET KICKED!

18:10.490 --> 18:12.192
I DON'T WANT TO GET KICKED!
TAKE HIM! TAKE HIM!

18:12.225 --> 18:13.660
COME HERE!
IT'S THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE!

18:13.693 --> 18:15.262
SHH!
TAKE HIM!

18:15.295 --> 18:16.596
OKAY, I WANT HIM FIRED.
FIRE HIM.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.730
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
OKAY, I CANNOT FIRE HIM.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.632
HE'S A GODSEND--YOU DON'T
RETURN GIFTS FROM HEAVEN.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.301
HE SLEPT WITH CHRISTINA.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

18:21.334 --> 18:22.302
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

18:22.335 --> 18:23.670
I DID,
I SLEPT WITH CHRISTINA.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.838
YEAH, HE DID.
IN THAT CASE, BE A GENTLEMAN.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.474
CALL HIM A WELSHMAN
AND MOVE ON.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.576
WAIT A MINUTE, GUYS,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIRE HIM?

18:29.609 --> 18:32.179
HOW CAN I FIRE HIM, DANNY?
HE'S GREAT FOR THE PRACTICE.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.646
WELL, I QUIT.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.216
DANNY, DON'T DO THAT.
DR. C, NO.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.151
YOU CAN'T--
WE ARE ALL FRIENDS, DANNY.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.852
WE ARE NOT FRIENDS.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.721
I KNOW
WHERE MY REAL FRIENDS ARE.

18:41.754 --> 18:42.822
OH, DR. C--

18:42.855 --> 18:44.557
PLEASE.
OH, DON'T GO.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.560
(Morgan)
DON'T LEAVE.
I NEED YOU.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.697
[basketball bouncing]

18:50.730 --> 18:51.698
(Tom)
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

18:51.731 --> 18:54.601
TOM, TAKE IT ALL THE WAY.
TAKE IT, TAKE IT.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.635
TEEN WOLF!

18:55.668 --> 18:57.337
AH!
I--FOULED, HE FOULED ME.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.438
DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH YOU.
DANNY!

18:58.471 --> 18:59.539
(Tom)
OFFENSIVE FOUL.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.208
COME HERE.
HOLD ON A SEC.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.309
HEY.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.376
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HEY.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.777
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
NO, NO WOMEN.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.714
NO, Y- M- C-A.
"CHRISTIAN MEN."

19:07.747 --> 19:08.615
MM-HMM.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.550
THE "M" IS UNCONDITIONAL,
BUT NOT "Y"?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.584
(both)
YEAH.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.186
OR "C"?

19:14.687 --> 19:16.223
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU--
DON'T SAY--

19:16.256 --> 19:17.089
[whispering]
HE'S JEWISH.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.491
YEAH, WHY ARE YOU HERE
CAUSING TROUBLE?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.193
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.694
OKAY, I NEED YOU
TO COME BACK TO WORK.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.496
NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S A HOSTILE PLACE.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.898
RIGHT HERE WITH THESE GUYS,
THIS IS A SAFE ENVIRONMENT.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.367
YEAH, YEAH, IT IS.
[whistles]

19:27.400 --> 19:29.269
MAN, YOU ARE COVERED
IN SWEAT.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.970
YOU GOT--YOUR BODY'S TRYING
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.004
SORRY.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.673
I KNOW THAT YOU THINK
THESE GUYS ARE HELPING YOU,

19:33.706 --> 19:34.841
BUT THEY'RE JUST
A BUNCH OF LOSERS

19:34.874 --> 19:36.376
WHO ARE WALLOWING
IN THEIR MISERY.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.544
THEY'RE NOT
GETTING OVER ANYTHING.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.279
HE'S OBVIOUSLY
STILL OBSESSED WITH ME.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.813
NO, I'M STILL OBSESSED
WITH THE WOMAN AFTER YOU.

19:40.847 --> 19:41.948
YOU KNOW,
THE ONE I MARRIED?

19:41.981 --> 19:43.616
YEAH, THAT ONE.
OKAY, WHATEVER.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.252
THESE GUYS ARE NEVER
GONNA GET OVER HEARTBREAK,

19:45.285 --> 19:47.620
BUT YOU CAN.
PAUL DID YOU THAT FAVOR.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.389
PAUL?
OKAY, ARE YOU STILL DRUNK?

19:49.422 --> 19:50.623
SHE ONLY SLEPT WITH PAUL
BECAUSE SHE KNEW

19:50.657 --> 19:51.658
THAT IT WOULD HURT
YOUR FEELINGS!

19:51.691 --> 19:52.859
SHE'S STILL OBSESSED
WITH YOU.

19:52.892 --> 19:53.860
SHE'S THE ONE WALLOWING--

19:53.893 --> 19:55.895
IS THAT
KRIS HUMPHRIES?

19:55.928 --> 19:58.231
YEAH, SHH.
HE'S IN THE GANG.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.332
CAN YOU INTRODUCE--

19:59.366 --> 20:00.667
JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE,
OKAY?

20:00.700 --> 20:01.668
HE'S GOING THROUGH
A HARD TIME.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.902
OKAY!
PLEASE, JUST COME BACK.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.437
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS--

20:04.471 --> 20:06.373
I WAS THINKING OF MAYBE
DOING SOME TRAVELING.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.740
YOU HATE EVERYWHERE.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.876
I WAS GONNA BUY
A ONE-WAY TICKET TO ARIZONA

20:09.909 --> 20:12.545
AND HAVE SWEET REVENGE SEX
WITH PAUL'S MOTHER.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.914
THAT'S HORRIFYING.
WHY A ONE-WAY TICKET?

20:14.947 --> 20:17.717
BECAUSE SHE'D BE SO GRATEFUL,
SHE'LL PAY FOR MY TICKET HOME.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.420
ARE YOU COMING BACK TO WORK
OR NOT?

20:20.453 --> 20:21.688
UH...

20:21.721 --> 20:22.955
GO.
GO, DANNY.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.691
YOU'RE READY FOR THIS.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.027
YOU DON'T BE LIKE ME, SITTING
AT HOME ALONE SATURDAY NIGHTS

20:28.060 --> 20:30.697
WATCHING TRASHY
REALITY TV SHOWS.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.432
I'M NOT GONNA NAME
WHICH ONES.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.267
TRUST ME, BRO,
YOU'RE BETTER OFF OVER THERE.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.735
MAN, BRING IT IN.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.705
MINDY, BACK UP.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.972
(Kris)
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.608
THANKS, MAN. I LOVE YOU, MAN.
I LOVE YOU TOO.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.509
I LOVE YOU TOO.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.644
HEY, HOW 'BOUT THIS?
I MAKE THIS SHOT,

20:44.677 --> 20:46.879
DANNY STAYS.
CHECK IT OUT, EVERYBODY.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.648
HERE WE GO!

20:50.750 --> 20:51.884
DIDN'T MAKE THE SHOT.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.320
BYE, DANNY.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.454
SEE YOU LATER, BUDDY.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.655
SEE YOU, BUDDY.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.658
(Paul)
"HELLO, GOOD FRIENDS, AND MINDY.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.627
"I WOULD LIKE
THIS RECORDED MESSAGE

21:00.660 --> 21:03.730
"TO STAND
AS MY FORMAL RESIGNATION.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.865
"I COULD NEVER ALLOW DANNY
TO QUIT

21:05.898 --> 21:08.435
"ON ACCOUNT
OF MY SEXUAL INDISCRETION.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.671
"AND OF COURSE, DANNY,
BEING PROUD AND STRONG,

21:11.704 --> 21:13.673
"WOULD NEVER WORK
ALONGSIDE A MAN

"WHO HAD SEX WITH HIS WIFE.

"I'M A SEX THERAPIST,
SO THE SEX WAS EXTRAORDINARY.

"I'LL MISS YOU ALL,

"I THINK HER HAIRCUT LOOKS NICE,

"AND WHILE I DON'T THINK WE'LL
EVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN--

"WE DON'T REALLY RUN
IN THE SAME CIRCLES--

I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST."

21:34.627 --> 21:36.663

GO TO BED.
