11:49.926 --> 11:54.452
HOW WOULD THEY KNOW THAT?
I'M NOT--I'M NOT REALLY A COP.

11:54.452 --> 11:58.108
WELL, THEN YOU'LL BE FINE.

11:58.108 --> 12:03.374
BESIDES, THEY GOT REAL EXCELLENT
MEDICAL FACILITIES HERE.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.035
[sighs]

12:34.144 --> 12:35.624
GRACE?

12:35.624 --> 12:37.234
SORRY.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.410
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

12:39.410 --> 12:43.980
NO. I WAS--I WAS THINKING ABOUT
JANE. I HOPE HE'S ALL RIGHT.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.940
HE'LL BE FINE.
MAYBE HE'LL LEARN SOMETHING.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.943
HI. ARE YOU GAIL?

12:49.943 --> 12:52.119
YES.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.642
IS YOUR MOM HERE?

12:53.642 --> 12:56.950
YES.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.603
ARE YOU FROM THE POLICE?

12:58.603 --> 13:01.955
YES, WE ARE.
CAN YOU TAKE US TO YOUR MOM?

13:01.955 --> 13:04.871
ARE YOU GONNA
BRING MY DADDY HOME?

13:04.871 --> 13:08.222
NO, SWEETIE, I'M SORRY.
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

13:14.968 --> 13:17.884
[shouting indistinctly]

13:21.278 --> 13:23.628
[man] WHAT?

13:27.284 --> 13:32.202
[indistinct conversations stop]

13:32.202 --> 13:33.769
SHH.

13:33.769 --> 13:36.206
GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.947
MORNING, PIG.

13:37.947 --> 13:41.690
[laughter]

13:41.690 --> 13:43.648
THANK YOU FOR RAISING
THAT ISSUE.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.520
LET ME ADDRESS THAT.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.045
YOU BELIEVE ME TO BE A POLICEMAN
OF SOME KIND. THAT IS NOT TRUE.

13:49.045 --> 13:51.308
I AM NOT A POLICEMAN,
NOR HAVE I EVER BEEN ONE.

13:51.308 --> 13:55.356
I DO WORK WITH THE POLICE. I USE
MY SKILLS TO CATCH MURDERERS,

13:55.356 --> 13:57.358
THOUGH RARELY DO I DEAL

13:57.358 --> 13:59.751
WITH PROFESSIONALS
SUCH AS YOURSELVES.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.405
WHAT SKILLS?

14:01.405 --> 14:04.234
MM. PEOPLE SKILLS.

14:04.234 --> 14:07.455
YOU SHOW ME YOUR SKILLS,
LITTLE BROTHER. [sniffs]

14:07.455 --> 14:08.673
YOU...

14:08.673 --> 14:10.414
YOU...

14:10.414 --> 14:13.200
ARE THE SHOT-CALLER IN HERE.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.552
YOU COME FROM THE BAY AREA.

14:17.552 --> 14:20.903
YOU LIKE TO SNIFF SOME KIND
OF GLUE OR SOLVENT TO GET HIGH.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.906
YOU WISH YOU COULD QUIT,
BECAUSE YOU THINK IT MAKES YOU

14:23.906 --> 14:26.430
LOOK WEAK
IN FRONT OF YOUR PEERS.IS THAT RIGHT? [sniffs]

14:26.430 --> 14:28.432
YES, BUT YOU NEEDN'T WORRY,

14:28.432 --> 14:30.434
BECAUSE THE WAY YOU ARE
WHEN YOU GET HIGH

14:30.434 --> 14:32.523
MAKES EVERYBODY
EVEN MORE SCARED OF YOU, RIGHT?

14:32.523 --> 14:35.483
[man] HELL YEAH, MAN.
YEAH.[men laughing,
speaking indistinctly]

14:35.483 --> 14:37.398
[man] FOR SURE.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.924
I DON'T THINK
I LIKE YOU MUCH.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.274
IF YOU STOP SEEING THE WORLD
IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU LIKE

14:44.274 --> 14:46.276
AND WHAT YOU DISLIKE
AND SAW THINGS

14:46.276 --> 14:48.713
FOR WHAT THEY TRULY ARE
IN THEMSELVES,

14:48.713 --> 14:51.891
YOU WOULD FIND A GREAT DEAL
MORE PEACE IN YOUR LIFE.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.198
AND I CAN HELP YOU
WITH THAT IF YOU WANT.I, UH--

14:55.198 --> 14:57.897
THINK ABOUT IT.
WHERE'S THE PHONE IN HERE?

14:57.897 --> 15:00.334
I NEED TO MAKE A CALL.OVER THERE.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.814
THANKS.

15:02.814 --> 15:05.469
[men mutter and laugh][Lisbon] THIS IS NICE.
THANK YOU.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.384
MM.DID YOU MAKE THESE?

15:07.384 --> 15:09.473
WE BOTH DID.MMM.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.475
WE'RE KEEPING OURSELVES BUSY.DELICIOUS.

15:11.475 --> 15:14.565
YOUR SHOW'S IN THE VCR, BABY,
IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT A WHILE.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.480
OKAY.

15:19.788 --> 15:22.312
WE'RE SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS,
DONNA.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.314
IT'S HARD.[pouring liquid]

15:24.314 --> 15:26.621
IT'S HARD.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.623
JUST WHEN THINGS
WERE GETTING BETTER.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.494
THINGS WERE GOING BADLY?

15:30.494 --> 15:32.496
UM, YOU KNOW,

15:32.496 --> 15:34.629
MARRIAGE STUFF.

15:34.629 --> 15:37.371
ME AND KIRBY HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
SINCE JUNIOR HIGH.

15:37.371 --> 15:40.765
PEOPLE CHANGE
WHEN THEY GROW UP.HOW SO?

15:40.765 --> 15:44.465
UM, WE KIND OF DRIFTED,
I GUESS.

15:44.465 --> 15:48.251
MY FAMILY, THE GERBERS--
WE'RE VERY CLOSE.

15:48.251 --> 15:51.689
IT CAN BE TOO MUCH WHAT WITH US
LIVING HERE TOGETHER AND ALL.

15:51.689 --> 15:55.824
KIRBY GOT TO FEELING KIND OF
SQUASHED UP AGAINST 'EM.

15:55.824 --> 15:58.435
HE WAS A LONE WOLF TYPE.

15:58.435 --> 16:02.135
LIKED TO BE IN THE WOODS
ON HIS OWN, YOU KNOW?

16:02.135 --> 16:04.659
WAS THERE ANYONE IN PARTICULAR
HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH

16:04.659 --> 16:07.227
OR WHO HAD A PROBLEM WITH HIM?

16:07.227 --> 16:08.706
NO.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.447
NO, JUST ME.

16:10.447 --> 16:14.016
AND LIKE I SAY, WE'D BEEN
DOING BETTER RECENTLY.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.018
HE WAS BEING
MORE HONEST WITH ME,

16:16.018 --> 16:18.934
OPENING UP
ABOUT HIS FEELINGS.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.936
YOU KNOW HOW MEN CAN BE.

16:20.936 --> 16:24.679
YES, WE DO.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.072
MONEY PROBLEMS?

16:26.072 --> 16:29.466
NO, MA'AM.
KIRBY WAS A SKILLED WELDER.

16:29.466 --> 16:33.253
[voice breaking] ALWAYS A GOOD
PROVIDER AND PROUD OF IT.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.864
AND THEN YOU HAVE
THE OIL MONEY COMING IN.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.520
YES, MA'AM.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.436
HOW MUCH DO YOU STAND
TO GAIN?

16:42.436 --> 16:44.438
UM, THEY SAY EACH
OF US YOUNGER COUSINS

16:44.438 --> 16:48.833
WILL GET AROUND
$80,000 A YEAR.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.010
I HAVE TO POINT THIS OUT
TO YOU, DONNA.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.055
THAT GIVES YOU
STRONG MOTIVE HERE.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.536
KIRBY WAS ENTITLED
TO HALF YOUR MONEY.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.233
IF YOUR MARRIAGE
WAS IN TROUBLE,

16:57.233 --> 16:59.670
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU PRETTY
UNHAPPY, WOULDN'T IT?

16:59.670 --> 17:01.977
OUR MARRIAGE
WASN'T IN TROUBLE.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.371
THE CORONER TELLS US THERE
WERE MANY UNHEALED BRUISES

17:04.371 --> 17:06.416
AND CONTUSIONS ON HIS BODY,

17:06.416 --> 17:08.375
WHICH SUGGESTS AROUND
THREE WEEKS BEFORE HIS DEATH,

17:08.375 --> 17:10.638
KIRBY WAS PRETTY BADLY
BEATEN UP.

17:10.638 --> 17:13.467
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

17:15.599 --> 17:19.386
[Patrick] NEXT TIME YOU FEEL
THE URGE TO GET HIGH,

17:19.386 --> 17:23.520
MAYBE YOU'LL SEE
YOUR MOTHER'S SMILING FACE.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.088
MAYBE YOU'LL ALREADY FEEL

17:26.088 --> 17:29.918
WARM, SAFE AND HAPPY.

17:29.918 --> 17:33.269
MAYBE YOU'LL REALIZE THAT HIGH
FEELING YOU GET FROM DRUGS

17:33.269 --> 17:35.010
IS AN ILLUSION,

17:35.010 --> 17:38.796
NOTHING MORE THAN CHEMICALS
MOVING AROUND IN YOUR BRAIN.

17:38.796 --> 17:41.712
[woman] INMATE JANE. INMATE
JANE TO THE VISITING ROOM.

17:41.712 --> 17:44.411
INMATE JANE
TO THE VISITING ROOM.

17:44.411 --> 17:47.631
[sniffs]MORE LATER.

17:47.631 --> 17:51.157
YOU ARE DOING GREAT.

17:54.247 --> 17:57.119
[buzzer sounds]

18:09.827 --> 18:12.265
THAT'S THE CASE PAPERWORK
SO FAR.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.223
THAT'S A COPY
OF THE VICTIM'S NOTEBOOK.MM.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.312
AND THOSE ARE
SOME SUDOKU PUZZLES.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.882
STILL LIKE LUSCOM FOR IT?

18:20.882 --> 18:22.666
YEAH, HE'S GOT
ATTITUDE AND MOTIVE.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.930
BUT THE CORONER SAYS
KIRBY HINES WAS BADLY BEATEN UP

18:25.930 --> 18:28.803
ABOUT A MONTH AGO, AT WHICH TIME
LUSCOM WAS IN CUSTODY

18:28.803 --> 18:32.415
ON A D.U.I.
AND RESISTING ARREST BEEF.COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF
LUSCOM'S FRIENDS THAT DID IT.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.287
YEAH, ONLY HINES
NEVER REPORTED A BEATING,

18:34.287 --> 18:37.942
DIDN'T GO TO A HOSPITAL, AND HIS
WIFE DENIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF IT.

18:37.942 --> 18:40.858
[raps table]YOU THINK KIRBY AND HIS WIFE
COULD HAVE KEPT QUIET

18:40.858 --> 18:43.992
ABOUT THE BEATING
'CAUSE IT WAS A FAMILY MATTER?YEAH. LISBON'S WITH
THE FATHER-IN-LAW NOW.

18:43.992 --> 18:47.604
KIRBY TOOK A BEATIN' LAST MONTH?
I DON'T RECALL THAT.

18:47.604 --> 18:50.303
FROM THE WAY DONNA REACTED
WHEN I ASKED HER ABOUT IT,

18:50.303 --> 18:51.956
IT SEEMED TO BE
A FAMILY MATTER.

18:51.956 --> 18:54.307
MAYBE YOU OR YOUR SON RODDY
GOT INVOLVED

18:54.307 --> 18:58.180
IN DONNA'S MARITAL PROBLEMS?[chuckles] NO.
NO, MA'AM, THAT'S WAY OFF.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.400
WELL, HEY, BABY CAKES.HI.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.099
YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU SICK OR SOMETHING?DO I LOOK SICK?

19:04.099 --> 19:06.406
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
WALKING AROUND IN SWEATS,

19:06.406 --> 19:08.799
NO MAKEUP, YOUR HAIR
ALL UP LIKE THAT.WELL, EXCUSE ME.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.367
MY STEPDAUGHTER'S
HUSBAND JUST DIED.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.587
I'M GRIEVING.THAT'S COOL. THAT'S COOL.

19:13.587 --> 19:17.634
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?OH, THIS IS AGENT LISBON
FROM CBI, COME ABOUT POOR KIRBY.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.288
MY WIFE SANDRINE.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.464
HMM. I NEED TO GO
TO THE MALL.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.466
WHAT'S YOUR THEORY,
SANDRINE?

19:23.466 --> 19:25.512
WHO KILLED KIRBY?

19:25.512 --> 19:28.341
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
DO I HAVE TO HAVE AN ANSWER?

19:28.341 --> 19:31.300
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
YOU GUYS' JOB.WORTH ASKING.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.693
I'LL BE HONEST.
I'M SORRY KIRBY'S DEAD,

19:32.693 --> 19:35.130
BUT I'M NOT SORRY

19:35.130 --> 19:39.047
MY DAUGHTER ISN'T MARRIED
TO A LOSER ANYMORE.IN WHAT WAY WAS HE A LOSER?

19:39.047 --> 19:41.092
HE WAS A BUZZKILL.

19:41.092 --> 19:44.095
THE GERBER FAMILY'S MOVING ON
UP, AND KIRBY DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

19:44.095 --> 19:46.097
HE LIKED BEING POOR
AND WHATEVER.

19:46.097 --> 19:49.318
NO VISION. DONNA DESERVES
MORE THAN THAT. RIGHT, SAND?

19:49.318 --> 19:51.320
MM-HMM. SHE'S A TREASURE.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.322
[chuckles]

19:54.976 --> 19:57.892
AGENT BOSCO, A WORD?

19:57.892 --> 19:59.763
SURE.

19:59.763 --> 20:02.288
I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY,
SO I WON'T TAKE UP YOUR TIME

20:02.288 --> 20:06.030
SHOOTING THE BREEZE, BEATING
AROUND THE BUSH AND ALL.THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.642
[Cho] WE WANT TO TALK
ABOUT JANE.LOOK, WE KNOW THAT JANE
CROSSED THE LINE,

20:08.642 --> 20:10.687
BUT YOU HELP US OUT HERE
AND, UH,

20:10.687 --> 20:12.994
WE'LL BE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL.
WE'LL OWE YOU BIG-TIME.

20:12.994 --> 20:16.476
[drops papers]OH, OKAY. I SEE.

20:16.476 --> 20:23.265
SO LET'S SAY I, UH, REACH OUT
FOR YOU TO DO SOME STUFF.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.398
WHAT KIND OF STUFF?

20:25.398 --> 20:27.922
WELL, THE KIND OF STUFF THAT
NEEDS TO GET DONE SOMETIMES,

20:27.922 --> 20:29.793
YOU KNOW,
TO TAKE THE BAD GUYS DOWN,

20:29.793 --> 20:31.708
KEEP THE GOOD GUYS
WALKING AROUND.

20:31.708 --> 20:35.756
NOTHING ILLEGAL. MAYBE A LITTLE
RULE BENDING ON THE DOWN LOW.

20:35.756 --> 20:38.280
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.109
SEE, THAT'S MY EXACT POINT.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.503
THERE IS A PROBLEM.

20:43.503 --> 20:46.723
THERE'S NO RULE BENDING
IN THE CBI.

20:46.723 --> 20:51.206
YOU TWO GUYS ARE GOOD AGENTS,
BUT JANE HAS CORRUPTED YOU.NO, HE HASN'T.

20:51.206 --> 20:55.819
SO YOU WERE READY TO BEND
THE RULES BEFORE HE GOT HERE?

20:55.819 --> 20:59.083
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.NICE TALKING TO YOU.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.740
"VULTURES!!!" "VULTURES!!!"

21:03.740 --> 21:05.742
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

21:05.742 --> 21:07.918
[sniffs]WHO ARE JAY AND MARTIN?

21:07.918 --> 21:10.878
YOU KNOW, VULTURES PEE ON
THEIR LEGS TO COOL THEMSELVES.

21:10.878 --> 21:13.489
[sniffs]HMM. IS THAT RIGHT?

21:13.489 --> 21:15.230
[sniffs]

21:15.230 --> 21:18.973
YES, OF COURSE.

21:18.973 --> 21:22.411
WHAT DOES "VULTURES!!!" MEAN?VULTURES ARE BIRDS.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.586
NO KIDDING.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.414
Hines was a bird-watcher.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.373
THAT'S WHY HE HAD BINOCULARS.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.462
HE SAW JAYS AND MARTINS

21:29.462 --> 21:31.899
AND VULTURES.

21:31.899 --> 21:34.554
GOT IT. GOOD.
SO THAT'S A DEAD-END.NO, ON THE CONTRARY,
IT'S A BREAKTHROUGH.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.904
I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH RODDY GERBER.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.733
I GOTTA ASK HIM
SOME QUESTIONS.WELL, RIGSBY'S
GONE TO MEET HIM.

21:39.733 --> 21:43.650
TELL ME, AND I'LL TELL RIGSBY
WHAT TO ASK HIM.OH, NOW WHERE IS THE FUN
IN THAT FOR ME?

21:43.650 --> 21:45.956
Can't you bring Gerber
in here?NO.

21:45.956 --> 21:48.437
OKAY, NO PROBLEM.
I'LL SORT IT OUT.

21:48.437 --> 21:51.353
I'll call you back.WAIT. YOU...

21:56.532 --> 21:59.361
[cell phone chirps]HEY, JAILY.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.798
UH, LISTEN, I JUST WANT
TO GIVE YOU THE HEADS-UP.

22:01.798 --> 22:04.410
I HAVE A VERY STRONG FEELING
RODDY GERBER IS GONNA BE

22:04.410 --> 22:06.412
HOSTILE AND AGGRESSIVE
TOWARDS YOU,

22:06.412 --> 22:09.328
SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BE
VERY CAREFUL WITH HIM.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.025
DON'T WORRY. I THINK
I CAN HANDLE RODDY GERBER.

22:11.025 --> 22:13.810
Well, I'm just warning you.

22:13.810 --> 22:17.031
APPARENTLY,
HE'S A VERY TOUGH GUY.YEAH, WELL, I'D LIKE
TO SEE HIM TRY SOMETHING.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.989
WE'LL SEE HOW TOUGH HE IS.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.252
WHATEVER.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.476
Roddy Gerber?

22:27.476 --> 22:29.652
YEAH, WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

22:29.652 --> 22:33.482
AGENT RIGSBY, CBI.
I'M ON MY WAY TO YOUR LOCATION.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.832
I have a couple of questions
I'd like to ask you first...

22:35.832 --> 22:37.356
discreetly.YEAH?

22:37.356 --> 22:40.315
I'VE HEARD FROM A COUPLE
OF RELIABLE SOURCES

22:40.315 --> 22:42.622
THAT YOU AND KIRBY HINES
WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR,

22:42.622 --> 22:46.452
uh, some kind of
sexual relationship.

22:46.452 --> 22:49.803
THAT'S A DAMN LIE.Are you sure, Roddy?

22:49.803 --> 22:52.936
LYING TO A CBI AGENT IS
A VERY SERIOUS OFFENSE.

22:52.936 --> 22:55.330
I WAS IN THE MARINE CORPS.

22:55.330 --> 22:58.377
OH, REALLY? WELL,
THAT SAYS IT ALL. I'M EX-ARMY.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.248
MARINE CORPS SUCK EGGS.

23:00.248 --> 23:03.033
But, hey, no point in arguing
over the phone.

23:03.033 --> 23:05.384
WE'LL SORT THIS OUT WHEN
I GET OUT TO YOUR LOCATION.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.778
SEMPER FI, SISSY BRITCHES.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.481
[engine turns off]

23:17.700 --> 23:21.312
RODDY GERBER?
AGENT RIGSBY, CBI.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.278
[buzzer sounds]

23:35.762 --> 23:39.330
RODDY.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.768
HEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

23:43.552 --> 23:46.250
[chuckles]

23:48.601 --> 23:50.690
[dominoes click]

23:50.690 --> 23:52.735
SO, RODDY,
TELL ME ABOUT THE VULTURES.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.911
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.913
SURE YOU DO.

23:56.913 --> 23:59.220
I DON'T LIKE YOUR TONE.

23:59.220 --> 24:02.484
MAN, WE TALKING
OR WE PLAYING? COME ON.

24:02.484 --> 24:05.444
KIRBY FOUND TURKEY VULTURES
NESTING ON YOUR LAND, DIDN'T HE?

24:05.444 --> 24:07.271
NO, HE DIDN'T.

24:07.271 --> 24:11.319
TURKEY VULTURES ARE DYING OUT
BECAUSE OF A LOSS OF HABITAT.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.147
THEY'RE A PROTECTED SPECIES.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.192
IS THAT RIGHT?

24:15.192 --> 24:16.890
YEAH, IT IS.SERIOUSLY NOW, YOU'RE
DISRESPECTING THE GAME.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.457
[click]

24:18.457 --> 24:21.329
THANK YOU.ONE MOMENT. THEY'RE PROTECTED,

24:21.329 --> 24:23.766
WHICH MEANS IF THEY'RE
NESTING ON YOUR LAND,

24:23.766 --> 24:27.378
YOU CAN'T DRILL FOR THE OIL,
AND YOU DON'T GET RICH.

24:27.378 --> 24:29.206
[click]THAT RIGHT?

24:29.206 --> 24:30.773
YES, IT IS.

24:30.773 --> 24:32.645
SO WHEN KIRBY
TELLS YOU ABOUT THE NEST,

24:32.645 --> 24:34.864
YOU TELL KIRBY TO SHOW YOU
WHERE THE NEST IS

24:34.864 --> 24:36.866
SO THAT YOU CAN DESTROY IT.NO.

24:36.866 --> 24:39.913
ONLY KIRBY DOESN'T WANT TO TELL
YOU, SO YOU BEAT HIM UP A LITTLE

24:39.913 --> 24:42.785
UNTIL HE DOES TELL YOU.
THEN YOU GO AND YOU SHOOT

24:42.785 --> 24:45.179
THE VULTURES,
AND YOU DESTROY THE NEST.NO.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.311
BAD LUCK TO KILL LARGE BIRDS
UNLESS YOU EAT 'EM.

24:47.311 --> 24:49.618
YOU DIDN'T EAT 'EM, DID YOU?HELL NO!

24:49.618 --> 24:53.274
HA! BUT YOU ADMIT
YOU SHOT 'EM, THOUGH.THEY'RE VULTURES, MAN!

24:53.274 --> 24:55.494
YOU THINK I'M GONNA GIVE UP
A MILLION BUCKS

24:55.494 --> 24:58.148
OVER A COUPLE UGLY MOTHERS
WHO EAT DEAD PEOPLE?

24:58.148 --> 25:00.107
NO FRICKIN' WAY.

25:00.107 --> 25:02.109
SO YOU SHOT 'EM.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.241
YEAH, I DID.

25:04.241 --> 25:06.113
ANYBODY WOULD.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.941
I CAN'T DISAGREE.

25:07.941 --> 25:09.769
AND KIRBY?

25:09.769 --> 25:11.292
NO, NOT ME.

25:11.292 --> 25:15.339
I KICKED HIS ASS, YEAH.
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

25:15.339 --> 25:18.473
NO NEED. WHAT THE HELL'S
HE GONNA DO TO ME?

25:18.473 --> 25:21.520
YOU SWEAR ON YOUR MOTHER'S GRAVE
YOU DIDN'T KILL KIRBY?

25:21.520 --> 25:26.481
I SWEAR ON MY MOM'S GRAVE
I DIDN'T KILL KIRBY.

25:28.178 --> 25:31.094
INTERESTING.

25:31.094 --> 25:34.228
NO, NO, NO. I THINK YOU SHOULD
TAKE LEAD. IT'S A FEMALE THING.

25:34.228 --> 25:37.187
NO, IT'S NOT. SHE'S FEMALE,
THAT'S ALL. HE'S NOT.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.842
YOU SHOULD TAKE LEAD.WHY ME?

25:39.842 --> 25:42.018
YOU'RE ALWAYS BEING,
YOU KNOW, TOO DIRECT.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.630
SHE WON'T BE OFFENDED.WHO WON'T BE OFFENDED?

25:44.630 --> 25:47.154
NOTHING. WELL...

25:47.154 --> 25:50.984
UH, WE WERE THINKING...

25:50.984 --> 25:53.856
THINKING'S GOOD.

25:53.856 --> 25:56.990
ABOUT?WE WENT TO BOSCO AND ASKED HIM
TO GIVE JANE A BREAK,

25:56.990 --> 25:59.253
BUT HE WOULDN'T.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.516
SO WE WERE THINKING MAYBE
IF YOU WENT AND ASKED BOSCO

26:01.516 --> 26:03.953
TO LET JANE GO
AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO YOU,

26:03.953 --> 26:06.608
BETWEEN FRIENDS, HE'D DO IT.WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

26:06.608 --> 26:09.306
WELL, YOU KNOW...IT'S OBVIOUS.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.221
HE HAS A THING FOR YOU--
SEXUAL THING.WE'RE NOT SAYING YOU HAD
AN AFFAIR OR ANYTHING,

26:11.221 --> 26:13.659
IT'S JUST THAT--HE LIKES YOU A LOT, IT SEEMS--

26:13.659 --> 26:16.444
THE WAY HE LOOKS
AT YOU SOMETIMES.

26:16.444 --> 26:20.056
YOU'RE MISTAKEN. BOSCO HAS
NO PARTICULAR LIKING FOR ME,

26:20.056 --> 26:23.016
AND EVEN IF HE DID, I WOULDN'T
USE IT AS LEVERAGE FOR JANE.

26:23.016 --> 26:26.149
WHY NOT?BECAUSE THE LAW IS THE LAW.

26:26.149 --> 26:29.370
JANE BROKE THE LAW, AND NOW HE'S
GOT TO PAY THE CONSEQUENCES.

26:29.370 --> 26:33.461
[cell phone rings]

26:33.461 --> 26:37.204
OH, HI, JANE.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.119
[sadly]
I NEED YOU TO COME VISIT ME.

26:39.119 --> 26:40.947
WHY? WE'RE BUSY.

26:40.947 --> 26:43.123
PLEASE, LISBON?
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

26:43.123 --> 26:46.343
I NEED TO SEE YOU.
ALSO A BLUEBERRY MUFFIN.

27:04.231 --> 27:05.798
[grunts]

27:05.798 --> 27:08.452
LOOKS LIKE CRANBERRY.

27:08.452 --> 27:12.108
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY BLUEBERRY.
WHAT'S UP?

27:14.894 --> 27:17.461
[lowers voice]
RODDY GERBER'S INNOCENT.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.202
[lowers voice]
THAT'S IT?

27:19.202 --> 27:21.248
PRETTY MUCH. WELL, NO.

27:21.248 --> 27:24.251
RODDY BEAT UP KIRBY
SO HE'D TELL HIM

27:24.251 --> 27:26.166
WHERE THE, UH, PROTECTED
VULTURES WERE NESTING

27:26.166 --> 27:29.082
SO RODDY COULD KILL THEM, BUT HE
SAYS HE DIDN'T KILL KIRBY,

27:29.082 --> 27:31.650
AND I BELIEVE HIM.
HE SWORE ON HIS MOTHER'S GRAVE.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.173
THAT'S INTERESTING,

27:33.173 --> 27:35.871
BUT YOU COULD HAVE
TOLD ME THAT ON THE PHONE.

27:35.871 --> 27:39.266
I NEEDED A VISITOR SO I COULD
GET INTO THE VISITORS ROOM.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.616
HOW I WISH I HAD MY GUN.

27:41.616 --> 27:44.184
HEY, CRIME-FIGHTING'S HARD.
SUCK IT UP.

27:44.184 --> 27:46.708
[whispering] LOOK,
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.276
DOOLEY GERBER?I NEED TO ASK HIM A QUESTION.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.757
WHAT QUESTION?ANY QUESTION.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.063
CAN YOU KEEP THE GUARD OFF ME?
COULD YOU, PLEASE?

27:54.063 --> 27:55.151
HEY.

27:55.151 --> 27:57.676
[normal voice] IT'S OKAY.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.201
[normal voice]
DOOLEY, YOU CAN TELL ME.

28:01.201 --> 28:04.160
THE TRUTH IS YOU KILLED YOUR
SON-IN-LAW. ISN'T THAT TRUE?

28:04.160 --> 28:07.207
AND WHO ARE YOU NOW?

28:07.207 --> 28:09.078
THAT'S A VERY GOOD ANSWER.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.950
THANK YOU.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.086
SO?

28:17.086 --> 28:18.392
WHAT'D YOU LEARN?

28:18.392 --> 28:21.090
WELL, THAT WAS
JUST A CONTROL QUESTION.

28:21.090 --> 28:24.833
THE NEXT QUESTION I ASK HIM
IS THE CRITICAL ONE.YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T NEED MY GUN.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.835
I CAN JUST HIT YOU
WITH MY CHAIR.

28:26.835 --> 28:29.838
I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT'S BOLTED
TO THE FLOOR. [chuckles]

28:29.838 --> 28:31.840
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU?

28:31.840 --> 28:33.799
YOU COULD GET
A PRISON SENTENCE.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.931
I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU'RE KEEPING ME IN JAIL

28:35.931 --> 28:38.064
IN THE HOPES THAT YOU
WILL TEACH ME A LESSON.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.109
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

28:40.109 --> 28:43.243
I AM NOT KEEPING YOU IN JAIL.
THE LAW IS KEEPING YOU IN JAIL.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.288
THE LAW,
AS PLAYED BY SAM BOSCO,

28:45.288 --> 28:48.161
AND YOU CAN MAKE SAM BOSCO DO
ANYTHING WHENEVER YOU LIKE.

28:48.161 --> 28:51.251
RIGHT. BECAUSE HE'S
SO IN LOVE WITH ME,

28:51.251 --> 28:53.209
I CAN MAKE HIM DO WHATEVER.

28:53.209 --> 28:55.385
YES.

28:55.385 --> 28:58.606
NO. NO, I WAS ONLY SAYING THAT
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT RIGSBY

28:58.606 --> 29:00.608
AND THE GUYS
WERE JUST SAYING.

29:00.608 --> 29:04.394
IT'S TOTAL NONSENSE. SAM BOSCO
IS A HAPPILY MARRIED MAN.

29:04.394 --> 29:07.223
HE HASN'T THE FAINTEST
INTEREST IN ME THAT WAY.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.225
I HAVE NO INFLUENCE
OVER HIM WHATSOEVER.

29:09.225 --> 29:12.054
THE GUYS NOTICED IT, TOO?
I'M IMPRESSED.

29:12.054 --> 29:14.622
HE'S VERY RECESSIVE
IN HIS PASSIONS.

29:14.622 --> 29:17.190
HARD TO SPOT THAT
HE'D KILL AND DIE FOR YOU.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.583
TRUST ME,
YOU ARE WAY OFF.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.585
INTERESTING PUZZLE
YOU PRESENT.

29:21.585 --> 29:25.633
LIES AND TRUTH
ALL MIXED TOGETHER.

29:25.633 --> 29:29.419
LOOK, I HOPE WE CAN GET YOU
OUT OF THIS MESS.

29:29.419 --> 29:33.206
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE
THAT I DO HOPE THAT

29:33.206 --> 29:35.208
YOU LEARN A LESSON
FROM THIS.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.210
THERE ARE REAL BOUNDARIES
IN LIFE.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.255
THESE ARE REAL PRISON WALLS.

OKAY, LEAVE HIM HERE.

I DREAMT THAT JANE
ESCAPED THE COUNTY JAIL.

34:10.352 --> 34:13.094
I DREAMT THAT THE SHERIFF,
THE A.G. AND THE DISTRICT SUPER

34:13.094 --> 34:14.965
ALL CALLED TO YELL AT ME.

34:14.965 --> 34:18.708
NOW YOU'RE GONNA
WAKE ME UP, YES?

34:18.708 --> 34:21.407
I'M SORRY, SIR.
I HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR HIM.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.409
HE IS BEYOND OUT OF LINE.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.411
HE'S BLOWN IT, ALL RIGHT.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.456
WE HAVE AN A.P.B. OUT,

34:27.456 --> 34:30.329

PERSUADE HIM TO COME IN QUIETLY.

NOBODY WANTS HIM TO GET HURT.CONTACT HIM HOW?
PERSUADE HIM HOW?

34:35.334 --> 34:37.466
YOU TWO ARE CLOSE.
HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.816
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.WHAT IS IT FUNNY?

34:39.816 --> 34:42.689
IT JUST IS.[cell phone rings]

34:49.609 --> 34:52.307
IF YOU SEND THE SHERIFF OVER,
I'LL HAVE KIRBY'S KILLER

34:57.747 --> 34:59.749
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

34:59.749 --> 35:02.535
YOU SAID YOU HAD
KIRBY'S KILLER.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.580
NOT YET, BUT I LIKE
TO BE AN OPTIMIST.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.366
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE MAKINGS
OF A CUP OF TEA, WOULD YOU?

35:07.366 --> 35:09.933
THANK YOU.

35:09.933 --> 35:10.804
YOU'RE WELCOME.

35:10.804 --> 35:13.589

SO LISTEN, UH, RODDY TOLD ME
ABOUT THE VULTURES

35:17.115 --> 35:21.075
AND WHAT HE DID TO KIRBY. HOW
DID YOU COPE WITH THAT, DONNA--

BEATEN BY YOUR BROTHER?

WITH WHO?

35:28.778 --> 35:30.911
MYSELF, MY FAMILY.

35:30.911 --> 35:33.870
KIRBY WAS A GOOD MAN,
AND I LET HIM DOWN.OH, HON.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.959
NO. NO, DADDY, IT'S TRUE.
I LET THE MONEY BLIND ME.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.179
WE ALL DID.

35:38.179 --> 35:41.791
EXCUSE ME.
I GOT STUFF TO DO.OH, PLEASE DON'T GO,
SANDRINE.

35:41.791 --> 35:44.490
I WAS JUST GONNA SAY
HOW FUNNY IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE

35:44.490 --> 35:47.754
A BIG FAMILY FIGHT,
IT CAN CLARIFY A SITUATION.

35:47.754 --> 35:50.235
DO YOU THINK
THAT HAPPENED AT ALL?I WISH.

35:50.235 --> 35:52.280
MAYBE KIRBY FOUND CLARITY.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.240
MAYBE KIRBY REALIZED
HOW, UH, IMPORTANT IT WAS

35:55.240 --> 35:57.242
FOR HIM TO BE TRUTHFUL.

35:57.242 --> 36:00.288
WHEN WE FOUND POOR KIRBY,

36:00.288 --> 36:02.769
HE HAD SOME FLECKS
OF GLITTER ON HIS FACE.

36:02.769 --> 36:05.424
AND WHEN I SAW YOU, DOOLEY,
AT THE PRISON,

36:05.424 --> 36:08.470
YOU HAD SOME GLITTER
ON YOUR FACE, TOO,

36:08.470 --> 36:11.386
WHICH MEANS YOU AND KIRBY
WERE IN CLOSE CONTACT

36:11.386 --> 36:14.868
TO THE SAME WOMAN--A WOMAN
WHO LIKES TO WEAR GLITTER.

36:14.868 --> 36:17.087
THAT WOULD BE YOU, SANDRINE.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.266
YOU'RE STUPID.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.702
OFTEN.

36:22.702 --> 36:27.446
BUT I NOW ALSO SEE THAT
NEITHER DOOLEY NOR DONNA

36:27.446 --> 36:31.493
HAD ANY NOTION OF THIS
CONNECTION BETWEEN YOU AND HE,

36:31.493 --> 36:34.931
WHICH MEANS KIRBY
WAS VERY CONSIDERATE...

36:34.931 --> 36:37.760
WHAT?CONSIDERATE ENOUGH TO WARN YOU
BEFORE HE CAME CLEAN

36:37.760 --> 36:39.675
ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR.

36:39.675 --> 36:42.852
[chuckles] OH, BABY, I SWEAR
ON MY LIFE THERE WAS NO AFFAIR.

36:42.852 --> 36:45.333
SURE THERE WAS. YOU WERE
BORED AND FRUSTRATED.

36:45.333 --> 36:48.380
HE WAS AVAILABLE.NO, NO, NO.

36:48.380 --> 36:51.165
KIRBY SOON FOUND OUT
WHAT KIND OF WOMAN YOU ARE,

36:51.165 --> 36:54.299
AND HE BROKE IT OFF, YES?
HE WANTED TO GET OUT

36:54.299 --> 36:57.302
OF SUTTER VALLEY. HE WANTED TO
START A NEW LIFE WITH HIS WIFE,

36:57.302 --> 36:58.564
THE WOMAN THAT
HE ACTUALLY DID LOVE.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.522
BUT FIRST HE FELT COMPELLED

37:00.522 --> 37:04.265
TO HAVE TO TELL
EVERYBODY THE TRUTH, THE FOOL.

37:04.265 --> 37:07.834
HE WAS GONNA RUIN YOUR LIFE
OVER WHAT--SOME BIRDS?

37:07.834 --> 37:10.010
FOR A BEATING THAT
HE POSSIBLY DESERVED?

37:10.010 --> 37:12.795
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
YOU BEGGED HIM NOT TO TELL.

37:12.795 --> 37:15.842
YOU BEGGED HIM,
AND HE JUST WOULDN'T LISTEN.

37:15.842 --> 37:18.410
THIS IS ALL A LIE.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.064
THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

37:21.064 --> 37:26.505
YEAH, YOU HAD TO KILL HIM
RIGHT THERE AND THEN.NO! NO! IT'S A LIE.
IT'S A LIE.

37:26.505 --> 37:29.943
I'M SORRY, SANDRINE, BUT WE HAVE
CONCLUSIVE FORENSIC EVIDENCE

37:29.943 --> 37:32.032
FROM OUR BOYS AT THE CRIME LAB.

37:32.032 --> 37:35.905
THE GLITTER ON KIRBY'S FACE
COVERED IN YOUR D.N.A.--COVERED.

37:35.905 --> 37:38.865
AND D.N.A. DOESN'T LIE.

37:38.865 --> 37:42.695
[voice trembling] I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT CAME FROM,

37:42.695 --> 37:44.044
'CAUSE IT WASN'T ME.

37:44.044 --> 37:45.959
POLICE ARE ON THEIR WAY,
SANDRINE.

37:45.959 --> 37:48.918
I WOULD BE HONEST
WITH YOUR FAMILY,

37:48.918 --> 37:51.791
'CAUSE YOU MAY NOT SEE THEM
FOR A WHILE.[siren wailing]

37:53.880 --> 37:55.185
SANDRINE.

37:55.185 --> 37:57.231
SANDRINE. SANDRINE!

37:57.231 --> 38:00.060
OH, PLEASE!TELL ME THAT IT ISN'T TRUE.
JUST TELL ME.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.845
HE MADE ME DO IT.[gasps]

38:02.845 --> 38:05.848
HE MADE YOU DO IT, HUH?NO, HE--HE MADE ME DO IT!

38:05.848 --> 38:08.198
[Patrick] SHE'LL--
SHE'LL HAVE HER PUNISHMENT.NOT ENOUGH!

38:08.198 --> 38:09.591
AAH! OHH.

38:09.591 --> 38:12.202
[siren bleeps]

38:15.684 --> 38:18.600
[voice amplified] PATRICK JANE,
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.472
COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP.

38:23.953 --> 38:26.173
UH, YES, IT'S ME
THEY'RE AFTER, NOT YOU.

38:26.173 --> 38:29.829
AND THERE IS
NO D.N.A. EVIDENCE EITHER.

38:29.829 --> 38:33.093
THAT SCIENTIFIC, FORENSIC STUFF,
IT'S--IT'S ALL VERY OVERRATED.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.791
THANK YOU FOR THE TEA.BUT WE--

38:35.791 --> 38:38.838
NO TAKE-BACKS.BUT YOU JUST--

38:38.838 --> 38:40.709
AH, AH. WHOOP.

38:42.842 --> 38:44.931
I'M COMING!

38:51.546 --> 38:53.983
OW.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.942
BYE.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.770
[police radio chatter]

38:57.770 --> 38:59.772
THANK YOU.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.643
WHOOPS.

39:05.952 --> 39:08.955
SO...

39:08.955 --> 39:11.827
SO...

39:11.827 --> 39:14.830
JANE GOT A CONFESSION
FROM SANDRINE GERBER.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.745
CASE CLOSED.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.008
YEAH, THE A.G.
LIKELY WON'T MAKE IT STICK,

39:19.008 --> 39:23.273
WHAT WITH HIS KEY WITNESS
BEING IN JAIL HIMSELF--

39:23.273 --> 39:27.887
IN FOR A GOOD, LONG SPELL ONCE
YOU ADD IN THE ESCAPE CHARGES.

39:27.887 --> 39:30.716
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.935
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD
TEACH JANE A LESSON.

39:32.935 --> 39:36.374
I THOUGHT HE'D BACK DOWN
OR APOLOGIZE, BUT HE DIDN'T,

39:36.374 --> 39:39.768
AND NOW IT'S GONE TOO FAR.
YOU GOTTA LET HIM GO.

39:39.768 --> 39:42.641
IF YOU DROP THE CHARGES,
THE A.G. WON'T CHASE IT.

39:42.641 --> 39:48.473
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT?

39:48.473 --> 39:51.737
DON'T MAKE ME GO THERE,
SAM.

39:54.740 --> 39:57.395
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
EXACTLY?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.832
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

39:59.832 --> 40:03.749
I'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

40:06.969 --> 40:09.407
YOU'D GO THERE?

40:09.407 --> 40:11.191
REALLY?

40:11.191 --> 40:13.236
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

40:13.236 --> 40:16.283
BELIEVE ME. HERE I AM.

40:20.592 --> 40:23.421
YOU WOULD RUIN OUR LIVES,

40:23.421 --> 40:25.379
OURCAREERS,

40:25.379 --> 40:27.512
OVER JANE?

40:27.512 --> 40:29.905
DOES HE MEAN
THAT MUCH TO YOU?

40:29.905 --> 40:31.994
HE CLOSES CASES.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.954
"HE CLOSES CASES."

40:34.954 --> 40:36.825
IS THAT ALL IT IS?

40:42.222 --> 40:45.355
I'M TELLING YOU IF YOU DON'T
LET JANE GO, I'LL TALK.

40:45.355 --> 40:48.837
THAT'S ALL.

40:48.837 --> 40:52.754
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

40:59.935 --> 41:01.937
YEAH, OKAY, YOU DID GOOD.

41:01.937 --> 41:04.331
BUT THERE'S TWO THINGS
PUZZLING ME.YEAH?

41:04.331 --> 41:06.333
HOW DID YOU GET
OUT OF JAIL,

41:06.333 --> 41:08.814
AND HOW DID YOU GET
A CHANGE OF CLOTHES?

41:08.814 --> 41:10.772
AH, WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION.

41:10.772 --> 41:12.992
IT WAS VERY... HEY, LISBON.HEY.

41:12.992 --> 41:14.950
SIMPLE.SO THEY LET YOU OUT, THEN?

41:14.950 --> 41:18.824
YES, UH, THEY DID.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

41:18.824 --> 41:20.303
SO MODEST.

41:20.303 --> 41:22.871
AH, RIGHT.
BOSCO'S SO IN LOVE WITH ME,

41:22.871 --> 41:25.004
HE'LL DO WHATEVER I SAY.

41:25.004 --> 41:28.660
YES. YEAH,
IT'S A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED.

41:28.660 --> 41:31.706
HE DOES LOVE YOU.
HOW COULD HE NOT?

41:31.706 --> 41:35.710
BUT HE'S NOT THE TYPE TO BEND
HIS PRINCIPLES OVER LOVE.

41:35.710 --> 41:38.626
SO I FIGURE
IT'S SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE.

41:38.626 --> 41:40.976
YOU MUST HAVE
SOMETHING ON HIM.YOU THINK?

41:40.976 --> 41:45.067
YES, SOMETHING HE DID WRONG,

41:45.067 --> 41:47.461
SOMETHING VERY BAD
THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT.

41:47.461 --> 41:49.898
NOW HE'S NOT THE TYPE
TO STEAL OR DO DRUGS,

41:49.898 --> 41:52.814
SO MY GUESS--HE HURT SOMEONE.

41:54.773 --> 41:56.601
HE KILLED 'EM.

41:56.601 --> 41:59.125
HE KILLED A BAD GUY THAT HE
COULDN'T CATCH ANY OTHER WAY.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.605
NO.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.781
YES, AND YOU
HELPED HIM DO IT.

42:02.781 --> 42:05.784
NO--YOU FOUND OUT
AFTER THE FACT,

42:05.784 --> 42:09.439
AND YOU...
LET HIM OFF THE HOOK

42:09.439 --> 42:12.181
BECAUSE THE BAD GUY
DESERVED IT.

42:12.181 --> 42:14.444
NO.

42:14.444 --> 42:17.970
I'M TOUCHED THAT YOU WOULD
RISK YOUR CAREER OVER ME.

42:17.970 --> 42:19.972
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

42:19.972 --> 42:23.062
IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU ARE,

42:23.062 --> 42:26.152
IT WOULD MEAN I BROKE
THE TRUST OF SOMEBODY

42:26.152 --> 42:28.850
I RESPECT AND ADMIRE
FOR YOUR SAKE.

42:28.850 --> 42:31.287
IF IT IS TRUE,
I WOULD HOPE IN THE FUTURE

42:31.287 --> 42:34.029
YOU'D BE A LITTLE BIT MORE
MATURE AND RESPONSIBLE

42:34.029 --> 42:35.857
IN YOUR BEHAVIOR.

42:35.857 --> 42:38.947
I'M GRATEFUL AND ALL THAT,
BUT LET'S NOT GO CRAZY HERE.

42:38.947 --> 42:41.167
I SHOULD HAVE
LET YOU ROT IN JAIL.

42:48.696 --> 42:51.481
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
