WEBVTT

00:18.561 --> 00:19.395
NINE YEARS EARLIER

00:19.478 --> 00:21.021
<i>After storing your belongings,</i>

00:21.105 --> 00:23.983
<i>all are invited to join us</i>

00:24.066 --> 00:27.528
<i>for a tropical drink.</i>

00:32.283 --> 00:33.200
That's it.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.124
-What the hell?
-Sorry! Sorry.

00:50.092 --> 00:51.177
Sorry.

00:51.635 --> 00:54.638
Now that you've seen it,
you'll have to die.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.182
You're in my cabin.

00:56.265 --> 01:00.352
You took away my dignity,
and now you want to take my cabin?

01:01.103 --> 01:03.397
I'm not wrong. Here.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.530
All checked.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.032
Here.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.075
Mr. and Mrs. Silva.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.162
It makes sense. Silva is a rare surname in Brazil.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.079
Really rare.

01:19.163 --> 01:21.415
Other rare surnames like Santos...

01:21.665 --> 01:23.501
-Sousa.
-...Oliveira,

01:24.126 --> 01:27.254
you may put them together.
They are related or married.

01:27.338 --> 01:28.589
And I'm not married.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.841
Write it down there I'm single.

01:31.175 --> 01:32.092
I'm single, too.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.679
It's not about her, it's not personal.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.389
It's just that right now,

01:37.473 --> 01:39.683
-I'm...
-Single, got it.

01:39.809 --> 01:44.939
It's just that we have no vacancies.
We're fully booked.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.398
What's the solution, then?

01:46.565 --> 01:48.692
Flip a coin,
the loser swims back to shore?

01:48.859 --> 01:52.947
I think the only solution now
is to share the cabin.

01:54.406 --> 01:58.035
Dear, here's what you're gonna do.
You'll find a room for me

01:58.118 --> 02:00.955
and another for her,
even if you have to sleep with the captain.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.290
Or my name is not Carlos Augusto da Silva.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.920
Don't sweat it. Relax.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.505
We've got champagne coming.

02:09.839 --> 02:14.468
The good stuff. The night will be great.
And the room is amazing.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.351
That's not gonna happen.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.019
Not at all.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.732
This cruise is gonna be unforgettable.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.151
Sure. I'm paying for it
in 10 installments.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.655
I just don't want to pressure you.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.991
I can sleep on the couch.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.075
I got it.

02:38.200 --> 02:42.788
We don't have to fuck because I broke up
with my boyfriend, I saw you naked,

02:42.872 --> 02:45.374
and we're sharing the same room
for seven days.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.042
Right.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.587
Let's get this straight.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.423
So, Mr. Silva,

02:53.507 --> 02:55.134
I'm tired of being well-behaved.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.346
I want it.

02:59.847 --> 03:00.806
Me, too.

03:01.599 --> 03:02.558
Mrs. Silva.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.297
We're getting a divorce.

03:38.469 --> 03:39.470
Seriously?

03:39.553 --> 03:41.639
How come? Just out of the blue?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.265
It's a friendly divorce.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.225
We'll all still be friends.

03:45.309 --> 03:48.187
-Yes, soccer on Sunday.
-Cards on Thursday.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.313
Why get a divorce?

03:49.897 --> 03:54.735
We're selling this place for a good price
and then we'll each get a smaller place.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.948
You'll really regret

03:59.031 --> 04:01.951
selling this great apartment
at Ocean Waves.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.703
We can't get a divorce
if we don't do that.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.705
The solution is selling this place.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.999
I'm appalled.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.251
Let's open that bottle to clear the...

04:11.335 --> 04:12.378
That's for decoration.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.297
Guys,

04:15.381 --> 04:19.176
we realized we'll be happier on our own.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.220
-That's all. Right, Caco?
-But...

04:21.303 --> 04:25.015
Every married person thinks so.
It's just an illusion.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.767
It's the seven-year itch.

04:29.061 --> 04:33.732
When we went through it,
I wanted to stab Guilherme everyday.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.240
What about New Year's Eve in Angra?

04:41.532 --> 04:42.700
It's no big deal.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.160
Camila can go if she wants to.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.954
Same for me, if Caco wants to go…

04:47.371 --> 04:49.081
-No big deal.
-Not at all.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.044
<i>Ana...</i>

04:54.253 --> 04:57.798
Don't you dare take Caco to Angra
instead of me.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.299
You know what's gonna happen?

04:59.383 --> 05:03.762
He and Guilherme will stay on the couch
playing video games all night.

05:03.929 --> 05:07.141
I go out and come back,
and he's still on the couch.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.977
He's such a wimp. Also,

05:10.227 --> 05:13.230
it's contagious. You'd better veto him.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.691
No problem, darling. I'll take care of it.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.192
-Okay?
<i>-Okay.</i>

05:17.276 --> 05:18.986
-Take care, bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

05:19.069 --> 05:21.572
Guilherme, don't you invite Camila.
She's insufferable.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.951
I can't even play video games
in my underwear.

05:26.035 --> 05:31.081
She's always having vendors over,
and I have to stay in my room.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.583
Her sour mood is contagious.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.667
She can give it to Ana.

05:33.751 --> 05:38.964
You get me because you said you and Ana
only have sex in special occasions.

05:39.048 --> 05:42.134
-Sex after marriage is crap.
<i>-Caco.</i>

05:42.384 --> 05:45.637
Guilherme is trying to tell you
that you're on speakerphone.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.599
Hello?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.060
You're breaking up.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.186
Holy fuck!

05:52.269 --> 05:53.812
<i>It's still on, Caco.</i>

05:53.896 --> 05:55.355
Shit.

05:56.899 --> 05:58.108
You know what?

05:58.192 --> 05:59.985
I'm not in the mood for dinner anymore.

06:00.069 --> 06:01.445
It'll help you relax.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.238
-Let's go home!
-I'm hungry.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.531
-Now.
-Oh, God.

06:09.912 --> 06:13.999
OCEAN WAVES APARTMENT COMPLEX

06:18.253 --> 06:19.463
Jandira.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.513
Good morning, Camila.

06:27.596 --> 06:28.764
Morning, Mrs. Camila.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.390
Woke up early?

06:30.933 --> 06:32.101
It's not 10:00 a.m. yet.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.603
I know, but I woke up feeling so grateful

06:34.686 --> 06:37.773
for this dear and wonderful person,

06:38.107 --> 06:39.191
Mrs. Jandira.

06:40.109 --> 06:43.362
I decided to make her a full breakfast
as a surprise.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.696
You're right.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.615
Because, Jandira,

06:46.698 --> 06:49.868
all these years here
were really hard for you.

06:50.369 --> 06:54.248
Caco's countless dirty underwear
tossed around the house.

06:54.414 --> 06:59.211
And all that hair, beard and pubic hair
clogging the sink.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.213
You're the one who takes it out.

07:01.296 --> 07:04.424
No woman can stand it. That's why

07:04.508 --> 07:07.636
I think Caco won't mind

07:07.719 --> 07:10.389
adding a special treat to this breakfast.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.932
It's already complete.

07:12.015 --> 07:15.561
The French biscuits he keeps
in the kitchen cabinet,

07:15.644 --> 07:17.646
waiting for a special occasion.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.398
Can you imagine a better occasion

07:19.481 --> 07:21.692
than our dear Jandira's breakfast?

07:21.775 --> 07:22.985
She doesn't like sweets.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.946
-Well, she's going to try them.
-All right.

07:26.029 --> 07:29.616
They're delicious with salted butter,
like a sandwich.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.369
Yeah, Camila, you're right.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.746
Mrs. Jandira deserves the best.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.750
So you won't mind if we gift her

07:39.001 --> 07:41.503
your coffee machine. It's yours, okay?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.088
A gift from us.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.466
You're getting a divorce, right?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.055
Can I talk to you?

07:52.139 --> 07:53.515
-Sure.
-Please.

07:58.896 --> 08:02.274
Are you crazy? You know I can't live
without my espresso.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.734
You drink too much coffee.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.320
Sell your game console
and buy me another machine.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.198
Camila, our divorce
was supposed to be friendly.

08:09.281 --> 08:10.282
I remember.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.659
Caco, I work a lot.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.370
I really need Jandira's help.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.873
Don't you think I've lost enough?

08:19.291 --> 08:21.126
How are you going to pay her
if you are unemployed?

08:21.585 --> 08:22.711
What about you?

08:23.253 --> 08:28.217
When we split up, I'll have more meetings
and triple my income.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.635
-Triple?
-Yes.

08:29.718 --> 08:33.222
Who's going to buy silly makeup
in such an economic crisis?

08:33.347 --> 08:36.558
Silly makeup has paid
for half our bills all this time.

08:36.642 --> 08:39.311
Now it's my fault Petrosil didn't pay me.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.648
It's not. But spending all day
on the couch is.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.567
I spend my day making phone calls,

08:45.651 --> 08:50.656
sending e-mails, spending my savings
because you need expensive Wi-Fi,

08:50.739 --> 08:52.282
rosé in the fridge...

08:52.366 --> 08:54.660
I work here, what did you expect?

08:54.743 --> 08:56.703
That I serve Kool-Aid, and fax people?

08:57.037 --> 08:59.665
You use the same Internet
to play video games.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.375
Excuse me, guys.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.920
Please, don't fight over me.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.090
I don't want to work for either of you.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.925
-Wait.
-Come on.

09:10.008 --> 09:14.763
I really like you, guys,
don't take it personally.

09:15.264 --> 09:19.059
But at this point in my life, I've decided

09:19.685 --> 09:20.686
to reduce my stress.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.647
-Okay...
-There's no stress here.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.275
-It's just a conversation.
-Yeah.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.444
A divorce? Without stress?

09:32.114 --> 09:33.699
Thank you for the gifts.

09:41.123 --> 09:41.957
It's my vendor.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.458
Let her in.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.715
Either you change clothes

09:49.923 --> 09:52.968
or go to your room.
That look is killing the ambience.

09:54.011 --> 09:54.845
Please.

09:57.556 --> 10:00.517
My New Fabulous.

10:01.143 --> 10:05.689
<i>Summer the whole year</i>

10:05.772 --> 10:08.150
<i>Make your face look fresh</i>

10:10.068 --> 10:12.404
<i>My New Fabulous is</i>
<i>the best cosmetics brand.</i>

10:12.487 --> 10:14.406
<i>For women and men like you and me.</i>

10:14.489 --> 10:16.616
<i>You can join us, too.</i>

10:19.536 --> 10:21.955
Welcome to My New Fabulous!

10:22.122 --> 10:23.707
My New...

10:23.790 --> 10:24.833
Fabulous.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.418
-Fa...
-Fa...

10:26.585 --> 10:27.419
-Fa...
-Fa...

10:27.502 --> 10:28.795
-...bulous.
-...bulous.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.130
-Fabulous.
-Fabulous.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.423
-Perfect.
-Thank you.

10:31.506 --> 10:36.636
Look, My New Fabulous will change
your life, as well as many women's lives.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.514
Financial independence,
being your own boss.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.767
I got a feeling this is gonna work.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.686
My husband said it's a scam.
We even had a fight.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.772
Always trust your intuition.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.775
Excuse me, Camila. Hi. Good afternoon.
I gotta leave.

10:49.858 --> 10:50.859
Sure, honey.

10:59.117 --> 10:59.993
He doesn't work?

11:00.077 --> 11:00.952
He doesn't need to.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.454
How wonderful.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.126
Hi. Is this a bad time?

11:08.418 --> 11:10.212
No, I was leaving anyway.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.297
Look, it's gonna be great.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.550
It will work fine.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.012
What?

11:19.096 --> 11:20.847
-Is Caco here?
-No.

11:22.974 --> 11:23.850
What is it?

11:24.393 --> 11:26.686
Do you remember the old tenant in 504?

11:26.770 --> 11:29.231
-The one who floats in the pool.
-Yes. He died.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.148
He drowned?

11:30.232 --> 11:32.109
No, he choked on a steak.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.235
Oh, my God!

11:33.318 --> 11:35.737
-Yeah, it's really bad.
-Yikes.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.825
Now his apartment is vacant. Guess what?

11:40.367 --> 11:41.785
Did he die in the apartment?

11:41.868 --> 11:42.744
Yes!

11:43.870 --> 11:46.873
Rent will get really cheap.

11:46.957 --> 11:50.794
Life is giving you the opportunity
to stay at Ocean Waves.

12:25.412 --> 12:29.124
You know what Nicole Kidman did
after breaking up with Tom Cruise?

12:29.207 --> 12:30.083
No, what?

12:30.709 --> 12:32.502
She won the Oscar!

12:33.920 --> 12:35.338
Let's go!

12:56.568 --> 12:59.154
<i>Smile, you are in the Barra.</i>

12:59.237 --> 13:02.491
Imagine having
that apartment just for myself.

13:02.657 --> 13:07.454
I'll have my My New Fabulous meetings
without Caco interrupting.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.873
I'll be able to drop by
your place unannounced.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.583
You already do that.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.961
Now I feel like I'm moving on.

13:15.045 --> 13:18.131
I just have to sell the apartment,
pay the debts,

13:18.215 --> 13:20.383
and I won't even leave this place.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.933
Why do you have the keys?

13:29.684 --> 13:34.606
I've been a voluntary apartment manager
for over 10 years. I'm in charge.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.236
Get ready! Guilherme?

13:39.778 --> 13:41.530
What are you doing here?

13:42.113 --> 13:44.324
Same thing as you, probably.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.043
Oh, Ana,

13:55.293 --> 13:58.171
you didn't tell me
the neighbor was so close.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.881
I can see what he's eating.

14:00.549 --> 14:03.260
No walking around naked, I guess.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.136
It's west-facing.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.721
-Yeah.
-Hot.

14:06.805 --> 14:10.559
Air conditioning on all day.
Electricity bill will be sky high.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.395
-Really high.
-Living room is small.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.439
What fits here? One, two, three…

14:16.523 --> 14:17.857
Three people, tops.

14:17.941 --> 14:21.319
It's really small, huh?
No room for the projector.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.656
Can't watch a movie, play video games.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.616
-It echoes in here.
-Yeah.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.412
This is bad.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.205
It's hollow.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.006
<i>Smile, you are...</i>

14:42.215 --> 14:43.675
It's a real find!

14:44.092 --> 14:45.677
Inside the complex.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.138
-I loved it!
-I told you.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.181
You'll be my guarantor, right?

14:50.265 --> 14:52.642
You'll be my guarantor, right?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.185
Yeah...

14:54.644 --> 14:56.104
See you at the card game.

15:02.611 --> 15:05.780
-Clean run!
-Look at that!

15:05.864 --> 15:08.325
Honey, I think that wasn't for real

15:08.408 --> 15:10.327
because it wasn't well shuffled.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.787
Of course it was for real. He won.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.665
No, Ana is right, it wasn't for real.

15:15.749 --> 15:20.587
It's like that Colombian expression,
"Fair games, great friendships."

15:20.795 --> 15:22.505
Yeah, exactly.

15:22.631 --> 15:25.175
That's why we need to talk to you.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.886
First of all, I want to say

15:27.969 --> 15:30.847
that nothing will change between us.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.516
Our friendship is the same.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.561
The same. Cards on Thursday,
soccer on Sunday.

15:36.645 --> 15:37.771
Guys, all right.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.273
You don't wanna be our guarantors, right?

15:40.357 --> 15:42.651
-Guarantor?
-No way.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.528
God forbid.
I wasn't guarantor for my sister.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.280
-No way.
-Then what?

15:48.531 --> 15:51.701
In the last resident association meeting,

15:51.785 --> 15:55.038
we talked about your overdue fees.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.081
No.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.500
Come on. We're a few days late.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.877
They're six months overdue.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.588
-Caco.
-Plus interest and fines.

16:03.672 --> 16:04.839
Caco.

16:05.423 --> 16:09.636
Guilherme, you know our situation.
After selling this place, we'll pay.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.555
Also, my compensation is coming.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.474
Sure, that's what I told them.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.644
But they still want to sue you guys.

16:17.727 --> 16:18.978
And in that case,

16:19.062 --> 16:23.066
you won't be able to sell this place
before paying the debt.

16:23.149 --> 16:26.986
Also, the apartment could go
up for auction and you might lose it.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.571
I can't believe that.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.950
-No, no.
-Calm down.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.702
We will help you out.

16:33.785 --> 16:37.205
Yes, we can pay your debt.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.415
What?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.963
This is so touching. Really?

16:45.046 --> 16:46.047
Come on, man.

16:46.131 --> 16:49.217
I don't know how to thank you.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.052
-Thank you so much.
-Come on.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.264
After paying the debt,

16:54.389 --> 16:56.599
-you sell the apartment to us.
-Perfect.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.184
I thought of a price.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.020
Take a look.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.617
What is this?

17:14.784 --> 17:17.996
Guilherme, that's not 10%
of the apartment's real value.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.914
Between 10% and nothing...

17:19.998 --> 17:21.040
Are you crazy?

17:21.124 --> 17:24.419
It's a very generous offer,
but, no, thank you.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.629
-Thank you, guys.
-Come on, guys,

17:26.713 --> 17:29.966
I didn't want you to leave Ocean Waves.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.971
Ask them to wait a bit longer.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.098
I really tried.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.642
I tried, but you know how it works.

17:39.851 --> 17:43.563
I'm a volunteer, I'm not really in charge.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.528
Unfortunately, it's not up to me.

17:50.904 --> 17:53.114
No loans to people with bad credit.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.073
What?

17:54.157 --> 17:57.744
And you can't use the apartment
as collateral as it's not fully paid off.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.038
It belongs to the building company.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.624
Hold up, bad credit?

18:02.707 --> 18:05.168
Is that because of the overdue condo fees?

18:06.252 --> 18:07.378
One moment.

18:10.757 --> 18:11.883
The system is down.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.135
Excuse me, one minute.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.768
PLATINUM BANK

18:23.019 --> 18:25.647
You're really concerned
about how we got bad credit?

18:25.730 --> 18:28.149
Who's gonna lend us money?

18:28.233 --> 18:31.694
So you're fine with our best friends
making a profit of us?

18:31.778 --> 18:35.240
Of course not, Caco,
but we need to focus on the apartment.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.161
Camila, don't look at me like that.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.122
You need to swallow your pride.

18:43.206 --> 18:46.251
My parents are retired, not rich.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.922
You've had bad credit for a while.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.633
It wasn't the condo fees.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.927
You have unpaid purchases.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.721
Like a plank machine?

18:58.805 --> 19:00.890
I haven't seen that in ages.

19:00.974 --> 19:04.310
Jandira uses it as an ironing board,
since he never used it.

19:04.394 --> 19:07.105
Many clients are waiting
for Petrosil's compensation.

19:07.272 --> 19:11.609
If that's a common issue,
you guys have a solution, right?

19:11.776 --> 19:16.072
I recommend asking
a close relative for a loan.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.533
Let's go, Camila.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.328
What's a bank for, then?

19:22.412 --> 19:25.206
Let me just say one thing.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.709
My compensation is about to come.

19:27.792 --> 19:31.004
I'll remember how you treat
Plus Gold Diamond clients.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.632
Come on.

19:37.385 --> 19:41.514
Come on, Camila. Stop insisting.
I won't ask my parents for a loan.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.182
Silly pride.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.204
<i>Good morning, Ocean Waves.</i>

20:05.288 --> 20:07.874
<i>No clouds in the sky today.</i>

20:07.957 --> 20:10.835
RESIDENT ASSOCIATION MEETING
ALL RESIDENTS INVITED

20:12.086 --> 20:13.838
BUDGET AND PENDING PAYMENTS

20:13.922 --> 20:15.423
RESIDENTS

20:15.506 --> 20:16.716
THIS FRIDAY

20:45.703 --> 20:46.537
Caco...

20:47.330 --> 20:48.915
Go sleep in the other room.

20:50.667 --> 20:51.626
In the office?

20:53.211 --> 20:54.754
Let's make it clear.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.631
We'll have to live together.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.133
But we're separated, right?

21:00.843 --> 21:02.887
I'll have to sleep on that tiny couch?

21:03.179 --> 21:07.600
"Amazing couch, really comfortable
for when your mother comes visit us."

21:08.226 --> 21:09.519
That's what you said.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.106
Don't forget to take your charger.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.015
Can't you do at least one thing I ask?

22:06.743 --> 22:07.577
Hey.

22:08.953 --> 22:11.080
Don't forget, we're the Silvas.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.292
Give me some space.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.591
Hug me.

22:26.471 --> 22:27.722
Nothing can take us down.
