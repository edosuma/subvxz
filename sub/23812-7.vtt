00:06.073 --> 00:09.575
Welcome to the Astorian
Fish Gut Grab.

00:11.012 --> 00:13.879
Every year, I bring good
luck to our fishing season

00:13.981 --> 00:19.018
by searching for a worm in a
tub of disgusting fish guts.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.455
Oh, that's why it smells
like an ocean's butt!

00:24.558 --> 00:26.759
The king always pukes
before he finds the worm.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.594
It's hilarious!

00:29.730 --> 00:32.430
I'm sure you'll all
eager to watch me barf.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.907
But it doesn't matter
what you want.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.368
I'm the king.

00:36.470 --> 00:40.406
So I'll be digging a gummy
worm out of pudding instead.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.176
No puking?

00:44.278 --> 00:46.412
Of course this happens
the year I show up.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.615
Take these guts away and
fetch my pudding tub.

00:50.785 --> 00:53.485
If he's not heaving,
this giant's leaving.

00:53.587 --> 00:54.820
Me too.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.100
The new combat cards are coming
out today at the Tasty Trunk.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.223
Combat cards?

00:58.325 --> 00:59.836
The last time you guys
played that game,

00:59.860 --> 01:00.900
you got into a huge fight.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.194
Yeah, I heard about that.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.730
The back of the castle still
has a Warwick-shaped hole.

01:05.900 --> 01:09.635
My bones healed, and
so did our friendship.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.670
See, our mistake was playing
against each other,

01:11.772 --> 01:13.372
so we agreed to never
do that again.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.075
More than agree, we
made a Phoenix swear.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.709
Phoenix swear!

01:17.812 --> 01:19.611
Swear, swear, swear, swear.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.849
Do you Phoenix swear
never to do that again?

01:25.453 --> 01:26.685
Come on, Friend.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.388
Let's go enjoy an afternoon
destroying other people.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.191
Ooh, we can take the shortcut
through the Warwick-shaped hole.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.828
Ah!

01:35.930 --> 01:37.830
The pudding has arrived.

01:37.932 --> 01:40.165
Behold the sweet
and delicious...

01:40.267 --> 01:42.134
rice pudding?

01:42.236 --> 01:45.137
That's like the fish
guts of pudding.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.572
Princess?!

01:46.674 --> 01:49.341
I need you to dig through
this yucky pudding.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.144
I can't put my hands
in that pudding.

01:52.246 --> 01:55.080
Of course not. You
need a pudding straw.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.715
If I dig through
that slimy stuff,

01:56.817 --> 02:00.853
I could lose my pixie ring.
Arc, that cannot happen!

02:04.325 --> 02:06.091
Are you asking me to
hold your magic ring?

02:06.193 --> 02:08.660
Because, uh, yeah!

02:08.762 --> 02:10.963
Princess?

02:11.065 --> 02:13.098
Oh, no. It's happening.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.468
What is wrong with you people?

02:21.008 --> 02:22.341
There's no time to explain.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.243
But whatever you do,
don't use the ring.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.244
Got it?

02:25.346 --> 02:27.379
Got it. Just go.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.381
Well, well, well.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.483
What do we have...

02:30.551 --> 02:31.984
Don't even think about it!

of the newest line
of combat cards.

03:47.161 --> 03:50.696
But we have a very
special surprise.

03:52.766 --> 03:57.035
One of these packs contains
the exclusive, unbeatable,

03:57.137 --> 03:59.705
two-handed Sir Gareth card.

03:59.807 --> 04:00.939
Wow!

04:01.041 --> 04:02.140
Yeah, I know.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.409
Back in the day, I used one
hand for slaying dragons

04:04.511 --> 04:06.778
and one hand for
fighting off the ladies.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.685
An unbeatable combat card?

04:13.787 --> 04:16.355
Prudie, if one of us gets
that, we could actually win.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.790
Oh, man. I just know
we're gonna get it!

04:18.892 --> 04:20.125
I got it!

04:25.599 --> 04:27.833
Look, it's Sir Gareth
before life broke him!

04:29.703 --> 04:31.903
And before Tammy the Tiny
yanked his hair out.

04:32.006 --> 04:34.906
It took me 10 years to grow it.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.609
And it took her 10 seconds
to rip it from my scalp.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.482
Buttercup, can I
please hold the card?

04:43.584 --> 04:47.352
No! You cannot hold anything.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.154
You'll get your loser
juice all over it.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.692
- What about me?
- You are even jucier.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.628
Now scram!

04:59.566 --> 05:01.166
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

05:01.268 --> 05:04.236
Prudie got a new vest.
It's adorable!

05:04.338 --> 05:08.407
No, Prudence and Warwick can't
keep their eyes off this card.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.542
You think so?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.416
Don't you remember the last time

05:17.518 --> 05:19.251
those two played each
other in combat cards?

05:19.353 --> 05:20.519
No.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.487
But I remember to not
look up when it's raining

05:22.589 --> 05:24.022
so water doesn't get up my nose.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.659
They got into a fight.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.628
We can use this card to
get them fighting again

05:29.730 --> 05:31.930
and split the Phoenix
Squad apart.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.201
- No, no, no, it's a good thing.
- Oh, then yay!

05:39.139 --> 05:41.106
I can't find the worm!

05:42.776 --> 05:45.944
And this pudding's
so warm and chunky!

05:48.582 --> 05:50.749
I see why this is so funny now.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.318
Hey, everyone, look!
She's gonna barf!

05:56.256 --> 05:57.789
What is wrong with you people?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.729
If you press the ring,
Ciara will be mad.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.791
But if you don't press the
ring, you'll never know

06:05.833 --> 06:07.999
what awesome thing
you could turn into.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.935
I say, tisn't it obvious,

06:10.037 --> 06:12.237
you silly bloke?

06:12.339 --> 06:14.272
Whoa, the ring's so powerful,

06:14.375 --> 06:17.542
it gave my imagination
a fancy accent.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.678
Oh, indeedly do.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.614
Now, if the ring turns
the princess into Ciara,

06:22.716 --> 06:24.683
- it'll turn...
- Me into a prince.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.618
Oh, that's using
your bean, old boy.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.154
Now, push that
rrring like a boss!

06:30.758 --> 06:32.958
You really think I
should do it, Your...

06:33.060 --> 06:34.993
Handsome Highness?

06:35.963 --> 06:37.340
How could listening
to me go wrong?

06:37.364 --> 06:38.930
I'm imaginary!

06:41.468 --> 06:43.135
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.811
What the heck? I'm a monster!

06:54.782 --> 06:59.184
Very funny, ring. Now it's
time to prince it up.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.857
The ring's not working?

07:07.060 --> 07:08.060

07:52.172 --> 07:54.940
What? No! No, no, it's me!

07:55.042 --> 07:56.975
Remember, Arc? The one
that knows your secret

07:57.077 --> 07:59.077
and... has a tail?

08:01.281 --> 08:04.382
You used the ring? How
could you be so selfish?

08:04.485 --> 08:06.551
I asked you to do
one thing for me.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.286
I know.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.222
But then I did something
for me instead.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.858
The ring has a security feature.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.260
If anyone besides me uses it,

08:15.362 --> 08:17.829
it stops working and
turns them into a...

08:17.931 --> 08:19.498
I want to say monkey pig.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.767
Why didn't you tell
me this would happen?

08:22.870 --> 08:25.203
Remember when I told you I
didn't have time to explain?

08:25.305 --> 08:27.405
That's part I didn't
have time to explain!

08:28.775 --> 08:30.909
Oh, so this is your fault.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.546
Without the ring, I
can't become Ciara.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.847
I'll never be able to go
to knight school again.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.352
Ah, hello? Slightly
worse problem.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.855
My ring came from the
Pixie Crystal River.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.257
Maybe someone there can help.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.791
I know how to get there.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.304
I passed through on
my way from Seagate.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.729
Oh, no, I'm oinking.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.077
Let's get to the river, and
maybe someone can fix my ring.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.568
Uh, and fix me?

08:56.670 --> 08:58.136
Yeah, sure... if we have time.

Gareth combat card!

09:07.848 --> 09:09.247
Buttercup, you let her hold it?

09:09.349 --> 09:11.182
We're using it to get
you two to fight.

09:11.285 --> 09:14.085
Fight your way out of
the slump you're in!

09:15.322 --> 09:16.788
That's probably what
I meant to say.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.859
So Buttercup asked me to decide

09:20.961 --> 09:22.594
which one of you to
give this card to.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.895
I'll take it!

09:23.997 --> 09:26.965
Ooh, this is so hard.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.300
No, it's not! Give it to me.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.769
Or better yet, give it to me.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.070
Wait a second.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.073
We made a Phoenix swear
not to fight each other.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.474
Yeah, you're right.

09:36.577 --> 09:41.112
Ooh, a Phoenix swear? That
sounds super unbreakable.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.448
So I guess I'll have to
find a different home

09:43.550 --> 09:44.616
for this little guy,

09:44.718 --> 09:48.286
since none of you will
ever, ever, ever want it.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.223
Let's get out of here.

09:52.326 --> 09:53.570
Our Phoenix swear
is more important

09:53.594 --> 09:55.827
than some amazing,
life-changing card.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.164
I mean, who needs that card when
I can have nothing instead?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.115
It's beautiful.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.916
My tail?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.684
Yeah, I'm starting
to think so, too.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.923
Okay, we have to convince
the Pixie Queen to help us

10:25.025 --> 10:26.358
or we're stuck
like this forever.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.525
Okay.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.565
Greetings, human travelers.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.500
What was that? Hold on.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.939
Oh my stars and moonbeams!

10:41.041 --> 10:43.742
Welcome to the Pixie
Crystal River,

10:43.844 --> 10:46.745
Astorian Princess and her...

10:46.847 --> 10:48.546
pet.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.653
- I am not her pet.
- Sorry.

10:54.755 --> 10:58.123
He thinks he's people. Who's
my little monkey pig?

10:58.225 --> 11:01.593
Oh, you are! You are!

11:01.695 --> 11:04.062
Pixie Queen, we've come
to beg for your help.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.597
There's no begging here.

11:05.699 --> 11:09.434
We only accept smiles,
hugs, and laughter.

11:18.679 --> 11:19.978
Ah, thank you.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.813
This selfish fleabag
broke my ring.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.416
Hey, I do not have fleas!

11:26.353 --> 11:27.752
Dang it, I have fleas.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.990
Once I repair your
ring's crystal,

11:32.092 --> 11:36.094
you'll be as pretty
as a princess.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.063
And you?

11:38.165 --> 11:39.864
Well, miracles happen.

11:42.536 --> 11:45.336
Your Highness, Arc and
I are so grateful.

11:45.439 --> 11:48.273
Did you just call him Arc?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.041
I heard Horatio.

11:50.143 --> 11:53.144
Horatio, the handsome
and loyal pet.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.514
Talking about how
handsome you are?

11:56.616 --> 11:58.283
Definitely Arc.

11:58.385 --> 12:02.654
- Wait, you know him?
- Oh, I know him all right.

12:02.756 --> 12:06.491
Arc, you mess with the pixies,
you get the sparkles!

12:11.631 --> 12:13.665
You know, a regular
person would've said,

12:13.767 --> 12:15.567
I know the Pixie Queen...
she hates me!

12:15.669 --> 12:18.236
I know the Pixie Queen.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.205
- She hates me.
- Too late!

Ow, ow! These sparkles sting!

12:32.719 --> 12:34.486
What exactly did you do to anger

12:34.588 --> 12:37.222
the sweetest creature
in the universe?

12:37.324 --> 12:40.291
My gosh, you're so nice.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.726
I'll tell you what he did.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.529
When Arc came here,

12:44.631 --> 12:47.198
we fed him our entire
crop of tiny raspberries.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.400
It was one thimble!

12:49.503 --> 12:51.836
How did I know it took
three years to grow?

12:52.839 --> 12:54.506
In return for his feast,

12:54.608 --> 12:56.241
he promised to bring
back a champion

12:56.343 --> 12:59.677
strong enough to lift a log
that fell on our village.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.981
Long story short, no champion.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.083
And the raspberry
festival was canceled.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.387
Well, in my defense, I found
an ogre and was gonna ask him.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.889
But he was headed
to knight school,

13:10.991 --> 13:14.025
so I forgot about you and
decided to follow my dreams.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.461
Is this helping?

13:17.764 --> 13:19.798
Yes, it is helping.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.735
Helping me to remember
how much I hate you!

13:24.938 --> 13:27.305
But are you going to help me?

13:27.407 --> 13:29.974
That's a big, sparkly no.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.611
So I'll never be Ciara again?

13:33.713 --> 13:36.381
I'm gonna be a monster
for the rest of my life?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.950

Oh, hello, Sage.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.842
Warwick, what a
wonderful surprise.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.344
- What can I do for you?
- Oh, nothing.

14:06.446 --> 14:10.148
I just want to talk about life,
the weather, and, you know...

14:10.250 --> 14:12.183
The all-powerful Sir
Gareth combat card?

14:12.285 --> 14:13.918
Yes, I need it in my life.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.821
This is for you.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.258
Cobra venom?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.026
My favorite perfume!

14:23.563 --> 14:24.729
You know, this makes me think

14:24.831 --> 14:26.531
you deserve that
Sir Gareth card.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.866
Thank you so much, Sage.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.668
Just do me a favor and
don't tell Prudence.

14:30.770 --> 14:33.271
Don't tell her what?
That you betrayed her?

14:33.373 --> 14:34.706
Yeah, don't tell her that.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.977
Hey, is that for Sage?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.112
Heh! No.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.449
It literally says "For Sage."

14:44.551 --> 14:46.885
Ah... oh, does it?

14:46.987 --> 14:47.852
I... yeah.

14:47.954 --> 14:49.854
Sage, this must be for you.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.859
Ooh, a pocket mace. You get me.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.763
You know, maybe you
deserve that card.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.999
You broke our Phoenix swear.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.834
So? You did the same thing.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.169
Yeah, but I didn't think
you'd find out about it.

15:06.973 --> 15:10.642
I am shocked to see such loyal
squad mates fighting like this.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.477
That sneak doesn't
deserve the card.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.679
- Give it to me.
- No, give it to me.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.115
Well, there's only one
way to settle this...

15:17.217 --> 15:20.718
A nice, friendly game
of combat cards.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.553
Or a not-so-friendly game!

15:26.559 --> 15:28.593
You're going down, Giant.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.029
I can't wait to slap
the magic out of you.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.404
I don't know why you're crying.

15:39.506 --> 15:40.939
If I can't turn back into Ciara,

15:41.041 --> 15:43.241
then my knight school
dreams are over.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.878
So are mine!

15:46.980 --> 15:49.747
There isn't a hole in
the armor for my tail.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.851
I've had enough of
your snort crying.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.054
I'm going home. It's
the pink house.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.256
The one that's
still under a log!

15:59.960 --> 16:01.326
Wait.

16:01.428 --> 16:05.596
Your Majesty, if I remove the
log, will you fix the ring?

16:05.699 --> 16:06.998
Um, I've spent all summer

16:07.100 --> 16:09.100
sharing a toilet with
a chipmunk, so no.

16:11.504 --> 16:15.773
I know my fate is sealed.
Please, help my friend.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.143
Very well.

16:19.245 --> 16:23.081
Save our village and I'll
restore the princess's ring.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.621
Arc, are you sure about this?

16:30.724 --> 16:32.623
Yeah, it's the least I could do.

16:32.726 --> 16:33.970
Besides, with my
monster strength,

16:33.994 --> 16:35.793
this is gonna be super easy.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.600
Uh oh!

16:42.702 --> 16:45.436

17:04.858 --> 17:06.491
Make monster noises
and scare them away.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.492
I don't make monster noises.

17:13.299 --> 17:16.800
The dragonflies left.
Nice work, Porkchop!

17:20.006 --> 17:22.807

Warwick-shaped hole!

18:48.394 --> 18:52.763
A warwick-shaped hole? Does
this seem familiar to you?

18:52.866 --> 18:54.198
This is how you were holding me

18:54.300 --> 18:56.467
the last time you threw
me through a wall.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.104
We've lost our minds again.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.006

19:02.108 --> 19:03.908
This combat's over, Sage.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.476
Oh, we're friends.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.944
We won't hurt each other.

19:07.046 --> 19:09.480
That's what you dum
dums sound like.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.716
Well, at least I can sell
that card for, like,

19:11.818 --> 19:12.950
a billion gold coins.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.919
No, you can't. I gave
that card to Sir Gareth!

19:15.021 --> 19:16.021
What?

19:16.089 --> 19:17.788
He traded me for a
Buttercup card.

19:17.891 --> 19:20.491
He said it was one of a kind!

19:21.594 --> 19:25.796
Ah, look at those hands...
and my luxurious dreadlocks.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.932
I bet this was when I
still had my spleen.

19:33.039 --> 19:36.407
Arc, if that thing
doesn't fry you, I will!

19:39.512 --> 19:42.346
Ugh, the dragon bug's gonna
roast me like a marshmallow

19:42.448 --> 19:44.882
and I still have
pudding in my pits!

19:44.984 --> 19:46.284
The pudding, that's it!

19:46.386 --> 19:48.586
You are not eating pit pudding.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.087
Dragonflies love sweets.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.456
Use the gummy worm to draw it
away and I'll lift the log.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.725
How do you know I still
have the gummy worm?

19:54.827 --> 19:56.093

shampoo, by the way.

nummy gummy worm!

20:15.048 --> 20:16.914
Go, Arc! Now's your chance!

20:25.925 --> 20:27.558
Hey!

20:27.660 --> 20:29.327

Princess, thank you.

Arc, you're not
completely horrible.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.372
Aww.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.175
I'm so happy, my
tail is wagging.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.910
A deal is a deal.

20:46.012 --> 20:49.480
Princess, I've
repaired your ring.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.815
Thank you.

20:50.917 --> 20:54.685
Your Majesty, what Arc just
did was incredibly unselfish.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.065
That should count for something.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.955
You're right, it should.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.291
But it doesn't. Buh bye!

21:05.098 --> 21:07.965
Yes, pixies, I know Arc
saved our village.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.533
No, he broke his promise.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.503
Well, that language
is inappropriate!

21:14.007 --> 21:15.773
Fine!

21:17.543 --> 21:20.711
It's the feeling of the pixie
community that you deserve

21:20.813 --> 21:23.981
to be returned back to normal.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.151
Please note this decision
was not unanimous.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.986
Thank you so much!

21:29.088 --> 21:30.521
Is there anything
else we can do?

21:30.623 --> 21:32.623
Yes. Go away!

21:37.830 --> 21:41.299
I'm Ciara again! And
you're not a monkey pig!

21:43.102 --> 21:45.069
Hello, beautiful nose.

21:45.171 --> 21:47.171
Hello, beautiful tail-free butt!

21:49.242 --> 21:51.542
I am so glad everything's
back to normal.

21:51.644 --> 21:52.410
Me too.

21:52.512 --> 21:56.580
Oh, no, I'm still oinking.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.817
We are not going back there.
