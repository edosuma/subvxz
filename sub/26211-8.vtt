24:27.533 --> 24:30.033
- Yep, copy.
Thanks for working hard today.

24:30.066 --> 24:32.266
- (BLEEP), calling me off.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.066
- Hey, bro,
I just sent Rhylee down

24:34.100 --> 24:36.033
'cause she's on night.
Is that okay?

24:36.066 --> 24:38.033
- I don't know, man.
You deal with her.

24:38.066 --> 24:39.734
I'm done.
- Mmm.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.734
- Mommy...

24:46.533 --> 24:48.533
- Um,
I have never cooked a pig.

24:50.033 --> 24:51.700
[cheers and applause]
- Thank you.

24:51.734 --> 24:53.567
- Pig roast, and he nailed it.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.033
He nailed it.

24:55.066 --> 24:56.533
- What do we got, Seanna?

24:56.567 --> 24:59.500
Are you sending a taxi?
- Affirmative.

24:59.533 --> 25:01.200
Chandler, Chandler, Lee.
- Go ahead.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.033
- We'll start making
our transfers.

25:03.066 --> 25:05.200
I know you guys haven't
been to that dock before.

25:05.233 --> 25:06.667
I still have to assume that

25:06.700 --> 25:08.700
my team is going to
execute things properly,

25:08.734 --> 25:11.166
even though I've seen them
make mistakes in the past.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.100
But it's dark out now,
and for Chandler,

25:13.133 --> 25:15.600
as far as I'm concerned,
prove it or lose it.

25:24.166 --> 25:25.567
- Copy that.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.200
- So,
because it's so dark now,

25:27.233 --> 25:29.166
we're not gonna
go back on the tender.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.700
We've arranged a taxi.
- Okay.

25:31.734 --> 25:34.100
- Caroline, Caroline, Lee.
- Yes, sir?

25:34.133 --> 25:35.567
- It might be
a good idea to...

25:38.700 --> 25:40.100
- Copy that.

25:40.133 --> 25:43.133
[indistinct chatter]

25:44.300 --> 25:46.333
- The dog is eating our food.
- Get out of here.

25:46.367 --> 25:48.200
Sh--.

25:48.233 --> 25:49.633
- I gotta get a picture
of that sunset--

25:49.667 --> 25:51.100
or, moonrise.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.734
[shutter clicks]
Tahitian moon.

25:52.767 --> 25:55.100
- You won't fall.
Uh-oh.

25:55.133 --> 25:56.734
- You guys just hold on.

26:00.734 --> 26:02.533
- [sighs]

26:02.567 --> 26:05.066
- Rhylee did a good job putting
the Jet Skis away today.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.700
- Yeah? Good.
- Yep.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.166
- Caroline, Caroline.
You all set?

26:10.200 --> 26:12.100
- I'm all set.
- Okay.

26:12.133 --> 26:14.166
We'll be receiving them
shortly.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.633
- The (BLEEP)?

26:15.667 --> 26:17.300
- Hey, Captain Lee!

26:17.333 --> 26:19.133
- Sorry about
the inconvenience.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.033
It was all in the
interest of safety.

26:21.066 --> 26:23.000
[glasses shattering]

26:23.033 --> 26:24.266
- Sh--.
[groans]

26:24.300 --> 26:26.000
(BLEEP)

26:26.033 --> 26:27.266
- We thoroughly enjoyed it.
Thank you.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.266
- We had a blast.
Sherry had a accident.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.734
- Sherry slipped a little bit.

26:30.767 --> 26:33.133
- I got dropped.
- You got dropped?

26:33.166 --> 26:34.567
That means you must
have been carried,

26:34.600 --> 26:36.200
and not successfully.

26:36.233 --> 26:39.000
- No, this is day two of
not-such-a-good-day for me.

26:39.033 --> 26:40.600
- Cap, I'm gonna need a second.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.400
We have some champagne
waiting for you.

26:42.433 --> 26:44.233
- Okay, let's go upstairs.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.033
- Go ahead.

26:51.166 --> 26:53.633
- Here, come back down.
- Let's go the other way.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.266
[cries]

26:57.300 --> 27:00.734
- What?
- [crying]

27:00.767 --> 27:02.000
- There's broken glass
everywhere?

27:02.033 --> 27:05.200
- [crying]
- Sh--.

27:05.233 --> 27:08.233
[tense music]

27:09.633 --> 27:11.200
- Cap, Cap, do you hear me?

27:11.233 --> 27:14.200
- Jesus Christ.
What the (BLEEP) is going on?

27:14.233 --> 27:15.667
- [crying]
- It's okay.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.333
It's okay.
It's okay.

27:17.367 --> 27:19.433
- [exhales]
(BLEEP)

27:19.467 --> 27:21.734
- Let me see.
Where--oh, right there?

27:21.767 --> 27:23.266
- Yeah, we got it out.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.667
- Cool.
- That's called a battle wound.

27:25.700 --> 27:27.266
- Yeah, I don't even
have one of those.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.066
How does that happen?

27:29.100 --> 27:31.400
I mean, it's just the
ultimate cluster(BLEEP).

27:31.433 --> 27:33.033
Give me five.
Give me a fist bump.

27:33.066 --> 27:34.300
All right, good job, buddy.

27:34.333 --> 27:36.166
- That little boy
just stepped on it.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.066
Do you have Band-Aids in there?
- Great, ----ing awesome.

27:38.100 --> 27:40.100
Yeah.
Ugh, (BLEEP).

27:40.133 --> 27:41.367
- Where is the deckhands?

27:41.400 --> 27:43.033
- Chandler needs
his hours of rest.

27:43.066 --> 27:46.000
- I'm not prepared for this.

27:46.033 --> 27:47.266
[table creaks]

27:47.300 --> 27:48.767
Oh!

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Don't chop your fingers off.
I can't lose you.

27:51.033 --> 27:52.734
- [laughs]
- I don't know how this...

27:52.767 --> 27:54.333
[chair rattles]
Done.

27:54.367 --> 27:57.100
- What do we have left?
Crew and equipment?

27:57.133 --> 27:58.367
- All the equipment, yeah.
- Okay.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.433
- Master Pearson
and Lady Tiernan's

28:00.467 --> 28:02.033
mandatory lifejackets.

28:02.066 --> 28:03.700
You wear that one.
I'll wear this one.

28:03.734 --> 28:07.367
Once again, just 'Siah and I
doing all the work.

28:07.400 --> 28:10.700
There is no fair reason why

28:10.734 --> 28:14.467
there's not a deck team member,
at least one, here helping us.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.633
Thank you.
Okay.

28:17.667 --> 28:19.100
Yes.

28:19.133 --> 28:20.367
Okay, easy does it.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.000
- Let's get the
drinks rolling.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.266
Drambuie? What else?
[laughter]

28:23.300 --> 28:25.033
What do you need?
[laughs]

28:25.066 --> 28:28.233
- I'll take a tequila,
club soda, and lime, please.

28:28.266 --> 28:29.767
- Sorry, I...
[groans]

28:30.000 --> 28:32.367
- It's okay.
Take care of the guests.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.767
Chandler will take care
of cleaning up, so...

28:35.000 --> 28:36.233
Get them whatever they need.
Relax.

28:36.266 --> 28:38.500
- [coughs] I feel sick.
I'm getting sick.

28:38.533 --> 28:41.200
- Relax.

28:41.233 --> 28:43.500
- [coughs]
- Coming up...

28:43.533 --> 28:45.100
- Yo, did you just
take that ice cream?

28:45.133 --> 28:46.367
- Ice cream's
not happening yet, buddy,

28:46.400 --> 28:48.000
'cause you're still working.

28:48.033 --> 28:49.266
- What the (BLEEP)
are you doing?

28:49.300 --> 28:51.000
I'm a big boy.

28:51.033 --> 28:52.333
- You're a big boy, and
you will get your ice cream.

28:56.734 --> 28:57.367
- I'm sorry, I...

28:57.367 --> 28:57.633
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's okay.

28:59.133 --> 29:00.700
Take care of the guests.

29:00.734 --> 29:02.500
Chandler will take care
of cleaning up, so...

29:02.533 --> 29:04.200
Get them whatever they need.
- [coughs]

29:04.233 --> 29:05.533
I feel sick.
I'm getting sick.

29:05.567 --> 29:07.333
- Relax.

29:07.367 --> 29:09.000
Take a deep breath.
Everything's fine.

29:09.033 --> 29:10.266
- Thanks.
- Give them their drinks.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.133
We're good.

29:12.166 --> 29:13.467
- Someone broke a ----ing glass
and he stepped on it.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.333
- Ooh.
- I don't know what happened.

29:15.367 --> 29:17.066
- I'm so sorry.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.367
- We're tough.
The Jasuwans are tough people.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.533
- I really felt
like an asshole,

29:21.567 --> 29:24.300
but knowing little
Pearson cut his foot

29:24.333 --> 29:27.300
on champagne glass
that I dropped--

29:27.333 --> 29:28.767
I feel terrible.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.233
You okay?
- Yes.

29:30.266 --> 29:31.500
- I'm really sorry.

29:31.533 --> 29:33.133
You're cool though, right?
You're good?

29:33.166 --> 29:35.133
[smooches]
Thanks for being so cool.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.166
Can I get you Band-Aids?

29:37.200 --> 29:39.066
- No, maybe some cocktails.

29:39.100 --> 29:41.233
- Yes, absolutely.
What can I get for everyone?

29:41.266 --> 29:44.233
I still have some champagne.
I can try getting on that.

29:44.266 --> 29:45.533
- Yeah, we'll just
have some champagne.

29:45.567 --> 29:47.333
Fill up whatever you got.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.133
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.166
- Yeah, the bandage?
- I have everything.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.100
- First aid?
Oh wow, you do, okay.

29:55.133 --> 29:57.533
Perfect. Right on.
- Okay, cool.

29:57.567 --> 29:59.200
- All right,
we're gonna do this.

29:59.233 --> 30:00.600
- This woman needs
a tequila shot!

30:00.633 --> 30:03.066
- I need a tequila, stat!
- On the double!

30:03.100 --> 30:04.467
- I got blood
all over my dress.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.266
It's like a $300 dress.

30:06.300 --> 30:07.767
It's not your mama's moo-moo.
It's, like, $350.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.533
- But why did--but why
didn't they do this for me?

30:10.567 --> 30:12.166
- I've gotta get Kate
in the back.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.433
- I'm getting in.

30:13.467 --> 30:16.333
I am starving,
I am exhausted,

30:16.367 --> 30:18.433
and I am angry.

30:18.467 --> 30:21.767
[tense music]

30:22.000 --> 30:24.600
- [grunts]
- Good job, Josiah.

30:24.633 --> 30:26.767
- Remember I said,
can I get a Prosecco, since...

30:27.367 --> 30:29.233
- I do remember.
- We just got back.

30:29.266 --> 30:31.100
How can I help you?
- Oh, Kate, yes.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.500
- I would love
another drink, please.

30:32.533 --> 30:34.400
- Tequila with
lime juice, yeah?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.433
- Any margarita you wanna make
is gonna be phenomenal.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.000
- Prosecco.

30:38.033 --> 30:39.200
- We've been, like,
waiting a while.

30:39.233 --> 30:40.500
- We'll get them right now.

30:43.266 --> 30:45.400
- [clears throat]
- I'm grabbing the tequila...

30:45.433 --> 30:47.567
- Can you hit the tea kettle
while you're there?

30:47.600 --> 30:49.433
- Hi!
- I'm injured.

30:49.467 --> 30:51.233
- Oh, no!

30:51.266 --> 30:53.400
- Chandler dropped me
on this slimy rock.

30:53.433 --> 30:55.300
- [gasps]
Chandler dropped you?

30:55.333 --> 30:57.333
- He didn't even say sorry.
- Chandler didn't say sorry?

30:57.367 --> 30:59.266
- No.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.200
- I'm getting some ice
for Sherry's leg.

31:01.233 --> 31:03.233
- Has she not been given
medical attention

31:03.266 --> 31:06.266
by anybody on the deck crew?
- It doesn't feel very cold,

31:06.300 --> 31:08.133
but it'll...
- It will get cold.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.100
- Chief stew's doing the
heavy lifting at the beach.

31:10.133 --> 31:13.066
It's nuts, but I'll just
keep making the drinks.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.333
Oh, my goodness.
So cute.

31:15.367 --> 31:17.200
- Say good night-night.
- Good night, guys.

31:17.233 --> 31:18.667
- Good job.
[indistinct chatter]

31:18.700 --> 31:21.433
- It's a big one.
It took a while, but it's good.

31:23.700 --> 31:26.333
I'm just so happy
the guests are safe--

31:26.367 --> 31:28.467
at least 90% of them.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.100
- 80%.

31:30.133 --> 31:31.367
- Oh,
did we get another injury?

31:31.400 --> 31:33.133
- The little boy cut...
- What happened?

31:33.166 --> 31:35.567
- I dropped a champagne glass
and he walked on it.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.500
- Flesh wounds...

31:37.533 --> 31:41.266
are not five star.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.266
- Yeah.
- I need to take a little--

31:43.300 --> 31:44.533
I can't talk about it
right now.

31:44.567 --> 31:46.433
Will you go flip laundry?
- Sure.

31:46.467 --> 31:49.266
At this point in the game,
I'm overwhelmed.

31:49.300 --> 31:51.567
[sighs]
I'm miserable on this boat.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.200
- How you guys doing?
You okay for drinks?

31:53.233 --> 31:54.400
- A couple more waters.

31:54.433 --> 31:55.667
- And a Crown and ginger
for you, yes?

31:55.700 --> 31:57.433
- Thank you, Josiah.
- No worries.

31:57.467 --> 32:00.100
- Chandler, maybe help her
downstairs a little bit?

32:00.133 --> 32:01.600
- No, please, I'm fine.
- You okay?

32:01.633 --> 32:04.266
- Yeah, I just wish
you'd said you were sorry

32:04.300 --> 32:05.533
for what you did.
- I am sorry.

32:05.567 --> 32:07.200
- I know, but you didn't.

32:07.233 --> 32:08.500
- I'm sorry.
It was a hectic morning for me.

32:08.533 --> 32:10.300
It's no excuse.
- No.

32:10.333 --> 32:12.567
It's like, no one came
and put antiseptic on me,

32:12.600 --> 32:14.533
like, Albert did.

32:14.567 --> 32:17.667
He, like, bandaged up my leg,
and took care of here and here

32:17.700 --> 32:19.567
and it's like, I don't know.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.266
- I...
[stammers]

32:21.300 --> 32:23.066
I hear you.
- I'm gonna go ice my hand.

32:23.100 --> 32:24.667
How do we get down?
- Right here, that way.

32:24.700 --> 32:26.433
- I'll show you, Mom.
I got you.

32:26.467 --> 32:28.500
- Thank you.
- Good night.

32:28.533 --> 32:31.133
- [sighs]

32:31.166 --> 32:33.100
- It's been one of them days.

32:33.133 --> 32:35.133
- It's chaos.
