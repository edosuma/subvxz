WEBVTT

00:10.087 --> 00:11.645
Well, that's our show for today.

00:11.807 --> 00:13.718
But before we close,
I'd like to invite you all

00:13.887 --> 00:16.924
to join us here at KACL
in wishing a fond farewell

00:17.087 --> 00:22.366
to our Happy Chef, Leo Pascale,
as he bubble-wraps his crepe pan

00:22.527 --> 00:24.961
and heads south
towards sunny Santa Fe.

00:25.327 --> 00:29.400
Leo, you stirred us
with your passion...

00:29.607 --> 00:33.236
...melted us with your charm,
added spice to our lives.

00:33.407 --> 00:37.446
Now, as you whisk yourself away...

00:37.647 --> 00:42.038
...let's not say goodbye,
but rather tartare for now.

00:43.887 --> 00:47.243
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.

00:47.407 --> 00:51.844
Well, at least you stopped short
of saying, "I'll be fricasseeing you."

00:52.727 --> 00:53.921
You ready to go to Leo's party?

00:54.087 --> 00:55.998
Oh, dear God,
there is nothing I detest more

00:56.167 --> 00:58.522
than a KACL goodbye party.

00:58.687 --> 01:00.040
They're all the same.

01:00.207 --> 01:03.244
Twist-top wine and a bunch of people
standing around awkwardly,

01:03.407 --> 01:06.240
trying to summon up some affection
for someone they hardly even know.

01:06.407 --> 01:08.159
It always ends up
reeking of insincerity.

01:08.367 --> 01:12.326
What are we gonna do, doc?
He's leaving us.

01:12.487 --> 01:16.639
- Bulldog and Leo were tight.
- Well, Bulldog certainly is.

01:16.967 --> 01:20.846
I love that guy, man.
He'd give me all his leftovers.

01:21.047 --> 01:24.164
I warned Leo, you keep feeding him,
he'll keep coming back.

01:24.367 --> 01:26.961
- Are you going to the party?
- Actually, I think I'm gonna pass.

01:27.127 --> 01:29.595
Come on. Doc, you gotta at least
have a drink, give him a hug.

01:29.807 --> 01:31.445
That is precisely
what I'm trying to avoid.

01:31.607 --> 01:33.165
When did we become
a society of huggers?

01:33.367 --> 01:36.598
Oh, we hug for everything nowadays.
I mean, "Hello." Hug.

01:36.767 --> 01:39.645
"Congratulations." Hug.
"Nice haircut." Hug.

01:40.247 --> 01:41.396
It's absurd.

01:41.607 --> 01:43.996
I mean, if we want to express
some real emotion for someone,

01:44.167 --> 01:46.158
- where is there left to go?
- I've had good luck

01:46.327 --> 01:47.919
with the storage closet.

01:49.207 --> 01:51.198
You know, I think you're
way too uptight about this.

01:51.367 --> 01:52.686
No, no, no, I see the doc's point.

01:52.847 --> 01:55.042
We all have different ways
of saying goodbye.

01:55.207 --> 02:00.076
Me, I prefer this method.
Get out! Come on! I got a show to do.

02:01.607 --> 02:03.598
Well, I think hugging
is very healthy.

02:03.807 --> 02:06.116
I read somewhere
that if you have physical contact

02:06.287 --> 02:09.085
on a regular basis,
it can actually extend your life.

02:09.287 --> 02:12.563
Well, in that case,
you should outlive Styrofoam.

02:16.767 --> 02:19.645
- Frasier, you made it.
- Well, Leo, you know I wouldn't miss

02:19.807 --> 02:24.517
- saying goodbye to you for the world.
ROZ: We're gonna miss you so much.

02:24.727 --> 02:28.402
We sure are. Oh, what the heck.

02:30.247 --> 02:34.479
You have no idea
how hard this is for me.

02:41.527 --> 02:42.801
FRASIER:
Thank you.

02:43.767 --> 02:46.235
I must say, Niles,
that is a striking tie you're wearing.

02:46.407 --> 02:47.999
Thank you. It was a gift from Maris.

02:48.207 --> 02:49.959
She had it made for me
to commemorate the end

02:50.127 --> 02:52.038
of that dreadful winter
she had her obesity scare.

02:52.207 --> 02:54.084
FRASIER:
Oh, yes.

02:54.847 --> 02:57.486
I remember her struggle
to lose that holiday pound.

02:57.647 --> 02:59.603
NILES:
Yes.

03:01.567 --> 03:04.559
After she'd restored her figure,
she had Yoshi set fire

03:04.727 --> 03:07.366
to a hippopotamus topiary
she felt had taunted her.

03:07.567 --> 03:08.966
Yeah.

03:09.167 --> 03:11.397
Then, as a visual reminder
never to let herself go again,

03:11.567 --> 03:15.845
she had this tie made for me out
of the legs of her fat pants. Thank you.

03:16.327 --> 03:19.285
You know, I would think
wearing a tie that Maris gave you

03:19.447 --> 03:21.722
might make you feel
a little bit melancholy.

03:22.007 --> 03:24.805
On the contrary. I have
every reason to believe Maris and I

03:24.967 --> 03:27.162
- may be on the road to reconciliation.
- Really?

03:27.327 --> 03:28.646
- We met for lunch today.
- Mm-hm.

03:28.807 --> 03:31.241
I told her I couldn't stand
being in separation limbo any more,

03:31.447 --> 03:33.039
and unless she wanted
the marriage to end,

03:33.207 --> 03:35.767
- we simply had to get into counselling.
- And she agreed?

03:35.967 --> 03:38.606
Her exact words were
"I'll think about it,"

03:38.767 --> 03:40.917
but I saw a twinkle
in her eye I have not seen

03:41.087 --> 03:44.796
since the neighbour children
discovered our new electric fence.

03:46.287 --> 03:49.006
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

03:49.207 --> 03:52.119
- The foam is a tad listless today.
- Yes. I can tell without looking

03:52.287 --> 03:55.359
they've got Chad
back on steamer duty.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.165
You are good.

03:57.367 --> 04:00.439
- Excuse me, Dr Niles Crane?
- I am.

04:00.607 --> 04:01.960
- Here.
NILES: Oh.

04:03.247 --> 04:04.805
Who's sending me this?

04:04.967 --> 04:07.197
"Notice. Petition...

04:07.367 --> 04:11.406
...for divorce."
- Sorry, man. Cool tie.

04:13.087 --> 04:17.079
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh... It's all right.

04:17.247 --> 04:21.286
Would have been nice if we'd given
therapy a try, but so be it.

04:21.487 --> 04:23.443
It's little consolation,
but you're to be applauded

04:23.607 --> 04:25.802
for how you're handling this.
A lesser man would panic.

04:26.007 --> 04:28.362
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I'll get her back.

04:29.327 --> 04:31.204
You have too much dignity
to let yourself beg.

04:31.407 --> 04:33.682
Please give me my phone back.
Please. Please.

04:33.847 --> 04:36.077
FRASIER:
Stop. Stop. Stop it!

04:36.287 --> 04:38.084
Listen, I know you're upset now,
but remember

04:38.247 --> 04:40.886
why you left Maris in the first place.
You were tired of grovelling.

04:41.087 --> 04:43.043
Yes, but I'm rested now.

04:45.407 --> 04:46.635
Fine.

04:47.367 --> 04:49.323
Go ahead
and toddle on back to Maris.

04:49.527 --> 04:51.802
Let her grind you under her boot heel
for another 12 years,

04:51.967 --> 04:53.878
rob you of whatever self-respect
you've retained.

04:54.047 --> 04:56.845
Then we can have
this conversation all over again!

04:58.007 --> 05:01.443
- I was unhappy, wasn't I?
- You were miserable.

05:03.007 --> 05:04.884
I'm sorry.

05:05.047 --> 05:09.643
It's just a lot to take in.
Twelve years of my life, gone.

05:09.807 --> 05:13.641
Oh, don't think of it as a loss,
but rather an opportunity for growth.

05:13.807 --> 05:16.002
- It's not an ending, it's...
- Frasier.

05:16.167 --> 05:18.237
No offence, but I'm familiar
with all the platitudes.

05:18.407 --> 05:21.956
I've just been served divorce papers.
I need a little time to let it sink in.

05:22.127 --> 05:24.721
If you don't mind, maybe we could
not talk about it for a while.

05:24.887 --> 05:27.003
- Of course.
- Hi. Can I get you guys anything?

05:27.167 --> 05:30.239
No, thank you.
We've already been served.

05:33.287 --> 05:35.039
Sorry.

05:40.447 --> 05:41.721
[DOOR HANDLE JOSTLING]

05:44.207 --> 05:46.801
- Oh, you're back.
- Yeah, I never should have left.

05:46.967 --> 05:48.719
The park was a disaster.

05:48.887 --> 05:52.118
You remember that outfit Mrs Foster
knitted Eddie for Christmas?

05:52.287 --> 05:53.720
Well, I bumped into her
in the lobby,

05:53.887 --> 05:55.718
and she said she was gonna
be going to the park.

05:55.887 --> 05:58.037
And I thought it would be rude
if I didn't at least have him

05:58.207 --> 06:00.118
wear it one time, you know?

06:00.287 --> 06:02.084
Eddie, get in here.

06:10.007 --> 06:13.044
Look at the poor guy.
He's humiliated.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.838
And then, of course,
she didn't even show up.

06:16.047 --> 06:19.323
But you know who was there? Duke.
And two guys from the old precinct.

06:19.487 --> 06:22.126
"Glad to see you've got something
to do, now that you're retired."

06:22.287 --> 06:26.485
"Hey, Marty, if I buy you some wool,
would you knit something for me?"

06:26.687 --> 06:27.961
Well, it could have been worse.

06:28.127 --> 06:31.119
You could have been wearing
the hat she made for you.

06:31.287 --> 06:33.198
DAPHNE:
Oh, dear.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.880
Would you take that off him?
He just looks so pathetic.

06:37.247 --> 06:39.363
DAPHNE:
Oh, come here, you poor little fella.

06:39.527 --> 06:41.119
- What's in the box?
- Oh, nothing.

06:41.287 --> 06:43.562
Just some old stuff
I was taking down to the storage bin.

06:43.727 --> 06:46.799
- Great. Why don't you take this with it.
- Yeah, just set that on top.

06:46.967 --> 06:49.481
No, no, it'll fall off if I do.

06:49.687 --> 06:51.962
Hey, this is my stuff.

06:52.167 --> 06:54.123
- It's a box of junk.
- It's not junk.

06:54.287 --> 06:58.041
Oh, rubbish. It's a bunch of useless
gadgets you haven't used in years.

06:58.207 --> 07:02.519
Like this remote control
to God knows what. Useless.

07:02.727 --> 07:04.319
Just like this, whatever it is.

07:04.527 --> 07:08.759
That's a Steam Master 2000,
like on TV. "Live life wrinkle-free."

07:08.927 --> 07:13.125
It even comes with an attachment
that cooks Chinese vegetables.

07:13.327 --> 07:14.476
[DOORBELL RINGS]

07:14.647 --> 07:17.241
It's Niles. I'm taking him to lunch
to get his mind off his troubles.

07:17.447 --> 07:20.484
- Something we shouldn't talk about?
- No reason we shouldn't talk about it.

07:20.687 --> 07:23.155
I don't think he's ready
to talk about it, so we're not.

07:23.367 --> 07:27.565
NILES: Would you mind not talking
about it a little less loudly?

07:29.247 --> 07:30.919
FRASIER: Niles.
- Afternoon, all.

07:31.087 --> 07:32.236
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hi, Niles.

07:32.447 --> 07:36.201
I appreciate your concern, but I'm
really doing quite well with all of this.

07:36.367 --> 07:38.278
- Everything's gonna be fine.
MARTIN: That's good.

07:38.447 --> 07:40.039
I just hope you got a good
divorce lawyer.

07:40.207 --> 07:42.198
You've been married a long time,
you gotta make sure

07:42.367 --> 07:43.356
you get your fair share.

07:43.567 --> 07:45.797
Well, according to the terms
of our prenuptial agreement,

07:45.967 --> 07:48.640
I believe I'm wearing my fair share.

07:48.847 --> 07:50.200
Well, take a tip from your old man.

07:50.367 --> 07:51.800
You get over there
and take possession

07:51.967 --> 07:55.118
of your personal belongings before
they box them up and toss them out.

07:55.327 --> 07:58.046
When will you just admit
that this junk belongs in a dustbin?

07:58.247 --> 08:00.681
You know, I was on a case once
where the wife constantly nagged

08:00.847 --> 08:03.236
the husband like this. "You never
put anything in the garbage.

08:03.407 --> 08:04.886
Why don't you put anything
in the garbage?"

08:05.047 --> 08:09.598
- Well, he should've listened to her.
- He did. That's where we found her.

08:12.047 --> 08:15.801
You know, I think Daphne's fighting an
uphill battle with this project of hers.

08:17.927 --> 08:20.361
- What's that?
- It's a journal.

08:20.527 --> 08:22.802
Look at this.

08:23.287 --> 08:24.800
Isn't that Mother's handwriting?

08:24.967 --> 08:28.516
These must be notes
from one of her research projects.

08:29.687 --> 08:33.361
"It's hard to imagine two male siblings
who could be more different

08:33.527 --> 08:34.846
than Frasier and Niles."

08:35.047 --> 08:36.799
Good heavens, it's about us.

08:37.006 --> 08:38.440
"Though both are highly intelligent,

08:38.607 --> 08:40.438
Frasier is clearly
the more dominant of the two,

08:40.607 --> 08:44.600
while Niles remains
extremely passive." Fascinating.

08:46.007 --> 08:48.760
"Frasier never seems to get
enough at mealtime.

08:48.967 --> 08:50.798
He's nearly twice the size of Niles,
and often,

08:50.967 --> 08:54.482
when he thinks I'm not looking,
steals his brother's food."

08:57.167 --> 08:59.840
"What Niles lacks in assertiveness,
he makes up for

09:00.007 --> 09:03.920
in an abnormally fussy
grooming regimen."

09:05.527 --> 09:08.405
"Frasier is exhibiting
clearly antisocial tendencies.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.922
In fact, he is extremely
uncomfortable with touch,

09:11.087 --> 09:13.043
seeming to recoil
from all human contact."

09:13.207 --> 09:14.196
Where does it say that?

09:14.367 --> 09:17.279
All right, I added "extremely,"
but it's right there.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.644
Good Lord.

09:20.807 --> 09:22.445
This cuts rather close to the bone.

09:22.607 --> 09:25.326
Just yesterday Roz was accusing me
of the same thing.

09:25.487 --> 09:28.957
I always thought it was just
an aversion to social hugging,

09:29.127 --> 09:31.197
but apparently
it goes deeper than that.

09:31.367 --> 09:35.599
You know, maybe this is something
I should work on. What do you think?

09:38.767 --> 09:40.564
Niles.

09:40.727 --> 09:44.242
"April 3rd. Niles remains
as docile as ever.

09:44.407 --> 09:47.046
He constantly allows himself
to be cowed and dominated,

09:47.207 --> 09:49.641
especially by females."

09:49.807 --> 09:53.482
Well, you shouldn't let that upset you.
You've broken that pattern.

09:53.647 --> 09:57.242
You could've knuckled under and gone
grovelling back to Maris, but you didn't.

09:57.407 --> 10:02.401
You know, Niles, I don't think
I've ever been more proud of you.

10:08.327 --> 10:11.046
- Oh, Frasier, this is awful.
- Well, pardon me for trying.

10:11.207 --> 10:13.004
I am new at it.

10:13.687 --> 10:16.281
No, no, no, you don't understand.
I did go grovelling back.

10:16.487 --> 10:17.476
What?

10:17.647 --> 10:19.285
I sent the divorce papers
back unsigned,

10:19.447 --> 10:21.278
along with a letter begging her
to take me back.

10:21.447 --> 10:23.165
- Oh, Niles, you didn't.
- Of course I did.

10:23.327 --> 10:25.795
You read the journal. It's who I am.

10:26.687 --> 10:28.678
- Well, how did she respond?
- Well, she hasn't yet.

10:28.847 --> 10:30.439
I just messengered it
to her this morning.

10:30.607 --> 10:33.326
It's her spa day.
She won't be home until...

10:36.167 --> 10:37.919
I still have time
to get that letter back.

10:38.087 --> 10:40.282
- I'm going with you.
- You're a good brother.

10:40.447 --> 10:42.642
This may be my last chance
to prove once and for all

10:42.807 --> 10:44.206
that I'm not the sort of man who...

10:44.807 --> 10:45.796
Whatever Mother said.

10:46.007 --> 10:48.919
Constantly allows himself to be cowed
and dominated, especially by females.

10:49.087 --> 10:51.806
- I might've known you'd memorize it.
- I'm sorry.

10:53.287 --> 10:55.005
You're right, that was harsh.
Come here.

10:55.167 --> 10:57.442
Oh, get away from me.

11:03.607 --> 11:06.485

those beasts and make our escape.

half of one of Maris' green pills
