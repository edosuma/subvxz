00:26.722 --> 00:28.898
As it is, Monsieur 98
is coming soon

00:28.898 --> 00:30.856
to work out an arrangement
with anyone that has

00:30.856 --> 00:33.033
the organization
and the police protection

00:33.033 --> 00:35.209
to move the junk
into the neighborhoods.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.515
Everyone down on
the fucking floor right now!

00:39.039 --> 00:40.431

all of the cops.

00:43.521 --> 00:45.915

your cops under control,

your black ass that I will.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.556

about a huge shipment of heroin.

01:18.556 --> 01:20.210

01:24.997 --> 01:28.088

about the heroin shipment?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.437
He didn't know
anything about it.

01:32.135 --> 01:33.484

Resignations.

01:33.484 --> 01:35.443

who shot up my club.

01:35.443 --> 01:38.489

- Carvens Aldridge

06:21.206 --> 06:23.121
is a genius young artist
from Harlem

06:23.121 --> 06:25.515
who came up through
the HARYOU program.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.734

he's leading the start

Harlem Renaissance.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.434
Yeah, it is.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.305
Just what this city
could use right now.

06:33.305 --> 06:37.135

paintings, dance, and poetry.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.615
Couldn't agree more.

06:38.615 --> 06:41.096
He had a horrible drug problem
and overcame it.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.664
He's been free of heroin
for almost two years.

06:45.622 --> 06:48.451
That's great.

06:48.451 --> 06:49.713
I hope you don't mind--

06:49.713 --> 06:53.413
I commissioned
a painting from him.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.806
Of course.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.460
Thank you.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.941

will inspire other artists

- Where are the children?

07:55.344 --> 07:58.347
I, um, sent them up
to your sister's.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.305

- What happened?

08:00.305 --> 08:01.698

11:09.886 --> 11:12.672

12:25.222 --> 12:27.050
Oh, I wanna hear
all about your trip,

12:27.050 --> 12:28.573
but I'm terribly late
for a meeting.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.488

tonight?

12:30.488 --> 12:32.403
Of course.

12:32.403 --> 12:34.057
He's out, per usual.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.146
He'll be so excited
you're back.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.322
I must've sent Margaret
20 postcards from Africa.

12:38.322 --> 12:39.802
I hope some have arrived
by now.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.325
I know they have.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.066
That's all
she talks about on the phone.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.894
Oh, good.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.983
She used to go on about
baking pies and climbing trees.

12:46.983 --> 12:49.812
And now, it is all about,
"I wanna go to Africa,"

12:49.812 --> 12:51.292
like Elise.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.773
It was like nothing
I've ever experienced.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.687
You look different.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.646
Something in your eyes.

12:58.734 --> 12:59.909
I'm jet-lagged.

12:59.909 --> 13:00.997
No, that's not it.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.651
It's the trip.

13:02.651 --> 13:07.264
You've expanded your horizons.
I can feel it.

13:07.264 --> 13:09.266
I want to hear every bit
about it when I get back.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.051
Oh, by the way...

13:14.054 --> 13:15.664
you got some mail yourself
while you were gone.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.448
I did?

13:17.448 --> 13:18.710
No return address.

13:18.710 --> 13:19.929
I noticed that, too.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.671
Six letters,
all in the same hand.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.891
Methinks you have
a secret admirer.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.854
Not so secret.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.508
Omar.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.819
Bring it up!

13:41.516 --> 13:43.039
Hurry up!

13:43.039 --> 13:45.302
Mr. Russo called.

13:45.302 --> 13:46.869
He can't meet you tomorrow

13:46.869 --> 13:48.958
'cause he's having
emergency gallbladder surgery.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.744
- Bullshit.
- He owes you money?

13:52.744 --> 13:54.529
You're a fast learner.

13:57.053 --> 14:00.491

14:11.894 --> 14:14.592
Yeah.
Belonged to my grandma.

14:14.592 --> 14:17.508
She loved Paris
just like you.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.771
Went there on her honeymoon
with my grandad.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.338
He got it for her.

14:21.338 --> 14:25.386
18-karat gold,
real diamonds.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.692
My grandad--
He might have been a bastard,

14:27.692 --> 14:31.261
but he wasn't
a cheap bastard.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.872
I can't accept this.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.786
Sure, ya can.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.788
It's a family heirloom.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.921

14:57.374 --> 14:59.072

14:59.072 --> 15:00.943
my father's aware
of the threat against me.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.205
They're not gonna touch me.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.207
Well, we don't know that
for sure.

15:04.207 --> 15:06.035

You've been kind,
but I'm begging you.

15:15.566 --> 15:18.178

16:47.136 --> 16:51.314
We would require all the money
up front again. I'm sorry.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.925
It's not a problem.
I got a rich partner.

- Police captain in my pocket.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.582
When I was living
on the streets,

17:41.582 --> 17:45.281
I used to draw abstract images
on anything I could find.

17:45.281 --> 17:49.111
You know, pieces of paper,
a sidewalk, a wall.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.939
What did you use for paint?

17:50.939 --> 17:52.375
Whatever I could find.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.247
You know, there was always
something around.

17:54.247 --> 17:55.639
If there wasn't,

17:55.639 --> 18:00.427
I'd use my own blood,
or dirt.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.081
Wow.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.736
And that's when you discovered
you loved painting?

18:05.736 --> 18:08.913
I used my imagination
to survive.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.785
You see, when I was high,

18:10.785 --> 18:13.004
I saw all these
beautiful colors.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.745
I went to a better place
in my head

18:14.745 --> 18:17.139
and wanted to capture that,
you know?

18:17.139 --> 18:20.273
But then you kicked heroin.

18:20.273 --> 18:24.407
And those images went away,
and I stopped painting.

18:24.407 --> 18:27.410
But something amazing happened.

18:27.410 --> 18:32.763
As I started to see life
the way it-- it really was,

18:32.763 --> 18:37.159
I started painting that,
you know?

18:37.159 --> 18:42.338
I wanted to find the beauty
in what's real.

18:42.338 --> 18:47.126
Your images of Harlem
are just breathtaking.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.692
That is why they say
you're starting

18:48.692 --> 18:51.130
a New Harlem Renaissance
in art.

18:53.697 --> 18:59.138
I'm just happy to be alive,
you know?

18:59.138 --> 19:03.533
Besides,
the Harlem Renaissance died.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.448
And you can't bring back
the dead.

19:05.448 --> 19:08.973
But you can start
something new.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.498
How's it going
with the painting?

19:11.498 --> 19:14.283
Oh, it's--
it's not finished yet.

19:14.283 --> 19:15.980
I hope you and your husband
like it.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.634
Oh, we are so excited.

19:17.634 --> 19:20.202
The moment it's done,
I'll bring him right over.

19:22.509 --> 19:25.033
You know, it's ironic.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.296
I used to buy my heroin
from his people.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.733
And now
he's paying me to paint.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.652
My husband and I
are so proud of you.

19:35.652 --> 19:38.307
And we consider it an honor
to both support you

19:38.307 --> 19:40.527
and hang one of your works
in our home.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.921
I...

19:43.921 --> 19:48.187
I've been thinking about
this idea for a long time.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.451
I-I really think
it's some of my best work.

19:55.629 --> 19:56.891
It's simple.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.719
I'm gonna need
your police officers

19:58.719 --> 20:00.547
to secure the Harbor
when the shipment comes in.

20:00.547 --> 20:04.333
You've got your nerve.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.206
It's an easy assignment.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.252
They come in, you keep
everybody back. That's it.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.167
Then you flood Harlem
with your narcotics.

20:15.301 --> 20:18.695
Heroin is a fact of life,

20:18.695 --> 20:20.262
Captain,
whether I bring it in or not.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.699
But the result
is still the same.

20:22.699 --> 20:26.137
Do you know how many Negroes
in Harlem die because of dope?

20:26.137 --> 20:28.357
Thousands every year.

20:28.357 --> 20:31.142
Not to mention the rise in crime
from burglaries and killings

20:31.142 --> 20:32.927
from junkies just trying
to finance their next fix.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.929
- That's not my problem.
- It's <i>my</i> problem.

20:36.670 --> 20:40.369
Drugs are crippling
this city,

20:40.369 --> 20:42.241
creating an endless cycle
of hopelessness.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.286
I didn't create heroin,
Captain Fields,

20:44.286 --> 20:46.070
or the desire for it.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.898
It's the junkie
who makes the choice.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.813
So you take
no responsibility?

20:49.813 --> 20:52.642
You claim you want to uplift
the community and help people.

20:52.642 --> 20:55.123
I send kids in Harlem to school
to educate them

20:55.123 --> 20:57.821
so that they never make
the choice to use drugs.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.562
Can you say the same thing
about Colombo

20:59.562 --> 21:01.129
or any of
the other mob bosses?

21:01.129 --> 21:04.132
Maybe you do that just
to soothe your conscience.

21:04.132 --> 21:07.918
You know, a few good deeds
don't wipe your soul clean.

21:07.918 --> 21:10.834
Before me, you were
on the Italians' pad.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.488
You took their money.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.925
Maybe you need to take
a look in the mirror.

21:14.925 --> 21:17.145
You know what? I don't want
to have to get you fired.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.582
You gonna do what I say?

21:19.582 --> 21:20.888
Mm-hmm.

21:22.237 --> 21:23.804
But this is the last time

21:23.804 --> 21:26.110
I do any bidding for you
or the Italians.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.677
Just secure the Harbor.

21:41.474 --> 21:45.304
I'm telling you, Del,
never felt better in my life.

21:45.304 --> 21:50.134
Marina and I danced and danced
two, three hours. Mm.

21:50.134 --> 21:53.355
Then I took her
back to my place.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.835
And?

21:54.835 --> 21:56.619
What do you mean, "and"?

21:56.619 --> 21:57.968
You know "and."

22:00.057 --> 22:01.450
And then some.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.799
- Come on. Oh, man.
- Yeah.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.366
Man, I hope you put a rubber
on that thing.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.672
One of you is enough.

22:05.672 --> 22:08.022
The point is,
I was dead tired.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.632
And the cocaine
picked me up.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.982
You know, Bumpy
don't allow drugs.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.333
I know, but this shit
ain't like duji, man.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.205
And if this Colombo motherfucker
landed the duji,

22:17.205 --> 22:19.381
then we need to find
something else to sell.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.992
Only rich white folks
buy that shit.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.516
Hm.

22:23.516 --> 22:26.693
Only rich white folks
can afford that shit.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.564
You see any rich crackers
walkin' around here?

22:28.564 --> 22:30.349
Look, let's just run
the idea by Bumpy.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.828
No, I can't
let you do that.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.352
Why? Huh?
'Cause it's my idea?

22:33.352 --> 22:35.092
Because I know Bumpy better
than you.

22:35.092 --> 22:36.398
What pisses him off.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.486
What's that?

22:37.486 --> 22:39.358
The lack
of "due diligence."

22:39.358 --> 22:40.837
Where's the market
for this?

22:40.837 --> 22:42.535
'Cause it sure ain't Harlem.

22:42.535 --> 22:46.103
And where would you get a steady
supply even if there was one?

22:46.103 --> 22:48.410
You just can't go to Bumpy
squawking nonsense.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.846
Okay. Fine.

22:49.846 --> 22:53.023
I'll do my motherfucking
due diligence.

22:53.023 --> 22:55.417
You just wish
it was your idea.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.865
Elise. Uh...

23:08.865 --> 23:10.214
I didn't think you'd come.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.956
I wasn't going to.

23:12.956 --> 23:15.698
But then you said you wanted to
join Malcolm's new organization.

23:15.698 --> 23:18.701
I understand he has plans
for a new mosque

23:18.701 --> 23:22.052
and alliances
with African leaders.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.446
I humbly submit I'd like
to be a part of that.

23:24.446 --> 23:27.623
Do you understand
how delusional you sound?

23:27.623 --> 23:29.712
You tried to kill him.

23:29.712 --> 23:30.800
What makes you think
he'd welcome you

23:30.800 --> 23:32.323
into his house of worship?

23:32.323 --> 23:35.631
He might not,
and I'd have to accept that.

23:35.631 --> 23:40.157
But more than Malcolm's
approval, I want yours.

23:40.157 --> 23:42.464
You're a grown man.
You can do as you please.

23:42.464 --> 23:46.990
I'm here to take responsibility
for my actions--

23:46.990 --> 23:50.472
toward him and toward you.

23:50.472 --> 23:54.607
You said vile, heartbreaking
things when you rejected me.

23:54.607 --> 23:58.349
Your pretty letters
can't change that.

23:58.349 --> 23:59.786
As I said in those letters,

23:59.786 --> 24:01.483
I was acting out of fear
and jealousy.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.267
I don't need to replay this.
I shouldn't have come here.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.095
You came because you still
have feelings for me.

24:05.095 --> 24:06.619
- That's a lie.
<i>- Is</i> it?

24:06.619 --> 24:10.013
To be honest, I wish
my father had killed you.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.276
Well, I praise Allah
he didn't.

24:12.276 --> 24:13.582
Otherwise my house
would've gone

24:13.582 --> 24:15.323
to my little brother
in Chicago.

24:17.107 --> 24:19.327
- Oh, that's not fair!
- I know.

24:19.327 --> 24:22.025
- He doesn't deserve it.
- No. You can't make me laugh.

24:24.027 --> 24:26.290
I'm sorry.

24:26.290 --> 24:29.293
Truly, Elise.

24:37.301 --> 24:40.479
Just think about my words.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.628
How is this plan going to work?

24:59.628 --> 25:05.199
We'll have police protection at
the Harbor both here and here.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.679
My fishing boats will come in
at night,

25:06.679 --> 25:09.638
so nobody's gonna see them.

25:09.638 --> 25:12.728
These waters are strong.
Your boats are small.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.730
My men are used
to negotiating the Atlantic.

25:14.730 --> 25:17.341
The Hudson River is not
gonna be any problem.

25:17.341 --> 25:20.519
Can your fishing boats
handle 3,000 kilos of heroin?

25:20.519 --> 25:23.347
My men have transported guns, artillery,

25:23.347 --> 25:25.567
even human beings
in boats like these.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.091
They'll meet your steamship
from Marseilles

25:28.091 --> 25:31.399
at about
20 nautical miles out.

25:31.399 --> 25:34.663
We have radar, so Coast Guard
will be nowhere near.

25:34.663 --> 25:37.710
This plan is safe,
and it will work.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.581
This is all good.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.540
But, uh, my bosses insist

25:41.540 --> 25:44.543
I meet with the Italians
to see what they have to say.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.241
The Italians will never pay
for the duji up front.

25:47.241 --> 25:48.895
You know that, right?

25:48.895 --> 25:53.203
Maybe, but I must first
hear them out of respect.

25:53.203 --> 25:56.685
Whoever controls the heroin,
controls Harlem.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.426
That has to be us.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.950
Whatever Colombo says,
we'll do better.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.430
You know me.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.867
I paid up front last time.
I'll do it again.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.956
Agreed.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.784
I respect your offer.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.570
But I must hear him out.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.746
It's just business,
as you know.

26:19.926 --> 26:22.450
So you two motherfuckers are
gonna stick together on this?

26:22.450 --> 26:25.888
Bumpy has offered to pay
the full price up front.

26:25.888 --> 26:27.890
Well, the Families have been
doing business

26:27.890 --> 26:30.110
with the Corsicans
for decades.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.721
We've never paid
more than half.

26:32.721 --> 26:37.247
I'm afraid Bumpy Johnson
has changed all that.

26:37.247 --> 26:38.945
Ah.

26:41.121 --> 26:44.733
You tell your bosses that
if they sell to Johnson,

26:44.733 --> 26:47.649
they're gonna have a problem
not just with me,

26:47.649 --> 26:50.130
but all Five Families.

26:50.130 --> 26:53.916
Listen, the men I work for
are businessmen.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.353
We don't get involved
in such things.

26:56.353 --> 26:59.269
Oh, yeah? Well, I think
you're pretty involved.

26:59.269 --> 27:02.011
Work it out
with Bumpy Johnson, not me.

27:02.011 --> 27:05.319
You do realize I take this
as a sign of disrespect?

27:05.319 --> 27:07.495
His offer is better.

27:07.495 --> 27:10.498
If you beat his offer,
there will be no problem.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.456
Oh.

27:12.456 --> 27:17.200
You mean if I bend over
and let you fuck me in the ass?

27:17.200 --> 27:20.203
What would you do
in my place?

27:20.203 --> 27:21.814
Listen to reason.

27:21.814 --> 27:26.035
There was a man you used
to work for, Jean Jehan.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.863
You remember him?

27:27.863 --> 27:31.345
Bumpy Johnson put a bullet
in his head.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.652
Can you trust him not to do
the same to you

27:33.652 --> 27:35.654
if he doesn't get his way?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.307
I trust Bumpy Johnson.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.005
I'm not sure
that isn't a mistake.

27:39.005 --> 27:43.749
But what will it take to make
you trust me just the same?

27:47.100 --> 27:49.058
A better offer.

27:50.538 --> 27:53.062
Then that's
what you'll get.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.812
Hmm.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.859
He wants to join
Malcolm's new mosque.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.599
Be a part of
the political struggle

28:08.599 --> 28:11.254
as well
as the spiritual one.

28:11.254 --> 28:12.865
I don't believe it.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.607
Do you still have feelings
for him?

28:16.607 --> 28:18.522
No. Not at all.

28:18.522 --> 28:22.352
Listen. Sometimes
the heart is irrational.

28:22.352 --> 28:24.615
I don't have feelings.

28:26.443 --> 28:30.447
In my opinion, Black men
have had it really rough.

28:30.447 --> 28:32.754
They're often misguided.

28:32.754 --> 28:36.279
I sometimes think they need,
how should I put it,

28:36.279 --> 28:38.847
extra special care.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.457
You didn't have that problem
with Malcolm.

28:40.457 --> 28:43.243
Didn't I?

28:43.243 --> 28:45.724
You should have seen the way
he courted me.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.203
It was ridiculous.

28:47.203 --> 28:50.380
He was awkward, standoffish,

28:50.380 --> 28:53.253
in a word-- lost.

28:55.081 --> 28:56.865
He asked me to marry him
over the phone.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.388
- No.
- It's true.

29:00.869 --> 29:04.438
Yes, but Omar...

29:04.438 --> 29:08.355
Omar tried to do
something unforgivable.

29:10.531 --> 29:13.229
All I know is, there are
too many Black Muslims

29:13.229 --> 29:16.406
who despise Malcolm because
of lies they've been told.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.800
When Malcolm has
their best interests at heart.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.802
And Omar fell right
into that trap.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.064
Exactly.

29:22.064 --> 29:25.067
And maybe he's come
to his senses.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.590
People can change.

29:26.590 --> 29:27.983
They can.

29:27.983 --> 29:29.245
But he's lost my trust.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.899
Then he has to get it back.

29:30.899 --> 29:32.727
- How?
- Not words.

29:34.947 --> 29:36.600
Deeds.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.517
Yeah.

29:47.655 --> 29:50.005
Yesterday was amazing.

29:50.005 --> 29:51.093
Mm.

29:51.093 --> 29:52.486
Mm-hmm.

29:52.486 --> 29:53.487
You want a cigarette?

29:53.487 --> 29:55.402
Nah. Nah.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.493
You know
what I would like?

29:59.493 --> 30:00.929
Hmm?

30:00.929 --> 30:04.324
I would like some more
of that shit.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.805
What shit?

30:06.805 --> 30:08.458
You know.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.679
<i>Cocaína.</i>

30:11.679 --> 30:16.989
Ay, papi, I wish I had some,
but that's impossible to find.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.381
Where'd you get it?

30:18.381 --> 30:20.993
I don't remember.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.951
What, it just fell
into your lap?

30:22.951 --> 30:25.301
Yeah.
Something like that.

30:25.301 --> 30:29.828
So tell me more about your job
at the extermination company.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.133
I asked you
a simple question

30:31.133 --> 30:33.266
and you're acting
all jinky and shit.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.575
Who'd you get
the cocaine from?

30:41.927 --> 30:45.887
I got it from a guy
who hangs out here sometimes.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.497
He works for Jose Battle.

30:47.497 --> 30:51.719
And? He has a name?

30:51.719 --> 30:54.374
- Reuben.
- Reuben.

30:54.374 --> 30:58.247
But, Nat, he tried to date me
until I found out

30:58.247 --> 30:59.727
he was a gangster.

30:59.727 --> 31:02.904
And I don't go with gangsters,
you know?

31:02.904 --> 31:05.428
And he's very jealous.

31:11.347 --> 31:12.914
<i>Amorcito.</i>

31:20.008 --> 31:22.706
No gangster could ever be
good enough for you.

31:26.580 --> 31:30.192
Maybe you could tell me
what he looks like.

31:39.419 --> 31:42.944
So, the word is out on the
streets that dope's coming.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.642
Junkies are goin' crazy!

31:45.642 --> 31:48.123
- That right?
- Yeah.

31:48.123 --> 31:49.385
We better cut that shit thin,

31:49.385 --> 31:51.735
or else
we're gonna sell out fast.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.918
You ever remember
your dreams?

31:59.918 --> 32:02.094
My dreams?

32:02.094 --> 32:04.226
Only when I dream
about the war.

32:04.226 --> 32:06.750
I got the same one
every time.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.578
The Battle of Chosin.

32:08.578 --> 32:11.059
Lost a lot of men
that day.

32:11.059 --> 32:14.497
I been told
I sometimes shout out.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.412
Why are you asking me that?

32:16.412 --> 32:19.981
Been having a lot
of dreams lately.

32:19.981 --> 32:23.637
Sometimes about Elise.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.639
Hey there, little one.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.990
I'm high, Daddy.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.296
Leave me alone.

32:32.037 --> 32:35.605
Sometimes
about junkies.

32:35.605 --> 32:36.998
Well, them junkies
are about

32:36.998 --> 32:39.435
to make all your dreams
come true.

32:39.435 --> 32:42.177
We'll be having the Italians
eating out of our hands.

32:42.177 --> 32:45.441
Speak of the devil.

32:45.441 --> 32:47.313
What the fuck?!

32:47.313 --> 32:48.967
Table for three?

32:48.967 --> 32:51.882
Oh, sister, we're just
gonna drop in on a friend.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.449
Uh, you mind if I sit?

32:53.449 --> 32:55.930
<i>♪ My life won't ever
be the same ♪</i>

32:58.019 --> 33:00.979
<i>♪ Tell me, what's the use,
what's the use? ♪</i>

33:00.979 --> 33:05.461
I'm the type of guy that likes
to deliver bad news in person.

33:05.461 --> 33:07.159
I'm the type of guy
who likes to hear it, quick.

33:07.159 --> 33:09.335
Yeah, real fast.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.514
You won't be participating
in the next shipment.

33:17.212 --> 33:19.171
Says who?

33:19.171 --> 33:22.391
The Corsicans have agreed
to make me their sole buyer

33:22.391 --> 33:25.829
at the usual rate--
half up front, half later.

33:25.829 --> 33:27.701
Monsieur 98 already accepted
my offer.

33:27.701 --> 33:30.573
Yeah.

33:30.573 --> 33:32.575
I went over his head.

33:37.885 --> 33:39.321
Take a look.

33:45.501 --> 33:46.850
- Ugh!
- Oh!

33:46.850 --> 33:48.635
Fuckin' fuckin' fuck!

33:50.941 --> 33:55.207
So, you see, if you want
to sell any dope,

33:55.207 --> 33:56.599
you're gonna have
to buy from me

33:56.599 --> 33:59.907
like every other motherfucker
in this town.

33:59.907 --> 34:01.865
Retail.

34:01.865 --> 34:04.781
On my terms.

34:04.781 --> 34:07.697
Or-- I don't know--

34:07.697 --> 34:11.266
maybe I won't sell
to you at all.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.007
Enjoy your meal.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.752
Motherfucker!

34:35.595 --> 34:37.249
Haven't seen that
in a while.

34:39.990 --> 34:41.427
I was just thinking
how much I've changed

34:41.427 --> 34:43.081
since I wore this uniform.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.038
Mm.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.565
In Africa
I wore my own clothes,

34:49.565 --> 34:51.393
and I met
with world leaders

34:51.393 --> 34:54.396
and they respected me as a woman
who could be a leader herself.

34:54.396 --> 34:56.790
That is wonderful.

35:00.185 --> 35:03.318
Did I tell you in Ghana
I met a black woman

35:03.318 --> 35:05.407
who had one of the highest
positions in government?

35:05.407 --> 35:06.974
Susanna Al-Hassan.

35:06.974 --> 35:09.455
She and President Nkrumah
did everything together.

35:09.455 --> 35:11.413
Oh, that's inspiring.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.502
You know the feeling, Mayme,

35:13.502 --> 35:16.288
'cause of the work you're doing
in politics for HARYOU.

35:16.288 --> 35:17.941
I want to do the same
for Malcolm.

35:17.941 --> 35:21.162
I am so happy that Malcolm
sees you as so capable

35:21.162 --> 35:24.426
he can trust you with all
the things he's dealing with.

35:24.426 --> 35:25.601
Which is why I feel
a responsibility

35:25.601 --> 35:27.777
to protect him,
if I can.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.388
Like my father's doing.

35:31.564 --> 35:34.436
Omar wants to work
for Malcolm,

35:34.436 --> 35:39.180
and even if he's sincere,
my feelings get in the way.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.487
Well, no one reads people
better than your father.

35:41.487 --> 35:42.836
And if you are anything
like him,

35:42.836 --> 35:45.534
you'll be able to tell
if he's sincere.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.710
You have that gift.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.799
It is your birthright.

35:49.799 --> 35:50.844
Use it.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.543
Hm.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.338
Did you get word
to my father?

36:08.731 --> 36:11.081
Yeah, yeah.

36:11.081 --> 36:14.302
Well, what'd he say?

36:14.302 --> 36:16.304
He wants to play it safe.

36:16.304 --> 36:17.827
He doesn't wanna take
any chances.

36:17.827 --> 36:20.482
He wants me
to look after you.

36:20.482 --> 36:23.398
You're lying.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.095
Excuse me?

36:25.095 --> 36:26.923
Well, who'd you talk to?
How'd you get word?

36:26.923 --> 36:28.055
Through his Jew lawyer.

36:28.055 --> 36:29.056
- Goldman?
- Yeah.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.231
That's not his name.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.667
Oh, whatever.
I talked to him.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.104
Don't bullshit me.
I know how to read people.

36:34.104 --> 36:37.195
Look...

36:37.195 --> 36:42.330
if I let you go and something
happens to you, I'm dead.

36:42.330 --> 36:44.332
I can't do what you ask, Stella,

36:44.332 --> 36:46.378
so shut the fuck up about it
and make the best of things!

36:46.378 --> 36:48.249
You're so full of shit!

36:50.338 --> 36:54.037
You wanna go to Paris...

36:54.037 --> 36:57.040
this is as close
as you're gonna get.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.522
You know, when your boss
gives you a gift,

37:00.522 --> 37:03.525
it's wise to accept it.

37:03.525 --> 37:06.354
I'm trying
to be friendly here!

37:06.354 --> 37:08.051
I let you go where you want,
do what you want.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.445
But never alone! There's
always someone fucking with me,

37:10.445 --> 37:11.968
and it's driving me insane!

37:11.968 --> 37:13.753
Then maybe you shouldn't have
called the Feds

37:13.753 --> 37:16.886
in the first place.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.715
You did this to yourself,
Stella, not me.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.199
Answer the fucking phone!

37:36.123 --> 37:38.908
Colombo's gonna come to you
to protect his shipment.

37:38.908 --> 37:40.475
He already has.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.782
He wants me to turn
a blind eye, just like you.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.262
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll triple it.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.785
What, so you can just
steal it from him?

37:45.785 --> 37:47.917
That's <i>my</i> concern.

37:47.917 --> 37:51.617
Either way, the dope
is coming into this community.

37:51.617 --> 37:55.011
It will kill and leave
destruction in its wake.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.753
Crime will rise,
along with despair

37:57.753 --> 37:59.755
and a never-ending
cycle of pain.

37:59.755 --> 38:03.106
Dope addiction is gonna be here
long after you and I are gone.

38:03.106 --> 38:04.760
Just tell me
what his plan is.

38:13.465 --> 38:16.685
I was first in my class.
Did you know that?

38:16.685 --> 38:18.165
I figured as much.

38:18.165 --> 38:20.515
And one of only
three black cadets.

38:20.515 --> 38:24.519
They treated us like the academy
was forced to hire us.

38:24.519 --> 38:27.653
Like we were unqualified.

38:27.653 --> 38:30.699
And I spent my entire life
proving them wrong.

38:30.699 --> 38:32.440
What do you care what those
white motherfuckers think?

38:32.440 --> 38:34.181
It matters what I think
of myself.

38:37.489 --> 38:39.708
And if I don't do
what you ask,

38:39.708 --> 38:43.451
you will expose me as the fraud
that I am and get me fired.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.235
And if I don't help
the Italians,

38:45.235 --> 38:47.977
they'll do the same,
or worse.

38:47.977 --> 38:50.850
If I'm in control of the dope,
then I got leverage over them.

38:50.850 --> 38:51.981
They can't touch you.

38:51.981 --> 38:53.505
Well,
that won't be necessary.

38:55.855 --> 38:57.813
- I'm resigning.
- What do you mean?

38:57.813 --> 38:59.380
Now I'm no use to either
one of you,

38:59.380 --> 39:00.903
and you both can go
straight to hell.

39:00.903 --> 39:02.209
You would throw away
your whole career?

39:02.209 --> 39:03.732
Everything that
you've worked for?

39:03.732 --> 39:05.517
That's right.

39:05.517 --> 39:08.824
My conscience won't allow me
to be a party to this evil.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.242
<i>¿Quién es Reuben?</i>

39:46.384 --> 39:48.603
Reuben?

39:48.603 --> 39:50.083
Who the fuck are you?

39:50.083 --> 39:52.564
My name's Nat Pettigrew.

39:52.564 --> 39:55.262
I hear you have something
I'm very interested in.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.959
I only want to buy
a little bit.

39:56.959 --> 39:59.440
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

40:03.096 --> 40:04.750
I work for Bumpy Johnson.

40:07.448 --> 40:09.537
Shit.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.800
Why didn't you
fucking say so, man?

40:11.800 --> 40:14.237
My man.

40:14.237 --> 40:17.589
I wanna start off small.
Maybe you can sell me a key.

40:17.589 --> 40:18.894
A key?

40:18.894 --> 40:21.331
Mm-hmm.

40:21.331 --> 40:23.812
You know how hard it is
to get this shit, man?

40:23.812 --> 40:27.425
The leaf is grown in Peru.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.906
Then it's processed in Chile,
then off to Cuba,

40:30.906 --> 40:35.258
then on a boat or a plane
to Miami, then Harlem.

40:35.258 --> 40:38.740
We deal in ounces,
<i>hermano,</i> not keys.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.481
How much is an ounce?

40:40.481 --> 40:41.787
$3,000.

40:41.787 --> 40:44.616
$3-- Are you out
your fuckin' mind?!

40:44.616 --> 40:47.009
That's the price, amigo.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.620
Take it or leave it.

40:52.972 --> 40:54.147
Okay. Alright.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.975
I'll take an ounce.

40:55.975 --> 40:58.368
You're in luck.

40:58.368 --> 41:00.588
I just had a Pan Am stewardess
put two ounces

41:00.588 --> 41:03.765
in her panties,
just yesterday.

41:03.765 --> 41:07.160
Meet me at Mount Morris,
135th Street entrance,

41:07.160 --> 41:09.423
10:00 tonight, okay?

41:10.990 --> 41:12.644
Mount Morris. Okay.

41:12.644 --> 41:14.820
Okay. Okay.

41:16.691 --> 41:18.954
By the way,
who gave you my name?

41:18.954 --> 41:21.348
You know, not too many people
deal in this stuff,

41:21.348 --> 41:22.697
and now I see why.

41:22.697 --> 41:24.003
$3,000 a fuckin' ounce?

41:24.003 --> 41:27.528
Specifically,
who told you about me?

41:27.528 --> 41:29.312
I don't know, man.

41:29.312 --> 41:31.314
Maybe it was one
of the bartenders here.

41:31.314 --> 41:32.838
Hmm.

41:32.838 --> 41:35.318
Alright.

41:35.318 --> 41:38.496
<i>- Salud.
- Salud.</i>

41:51.596 --> 41:55.425
It's, uh, j-just such
an honor to meet you.

41:55.425 --> 41:59.386
My wife's talked a lot
about your work, and about you.

41:59.386 --> 42:01.257
When Mayme gave me
this commission,

42:01.257 --> 42:03.695
I was flabbergasted.

42:03.695 --> 42:06.045
Everybody in Harlem knows
Bumpy Johnson.

42:06.045 --> 42:09.570
You know, some fear you,
some see you as their savior.

42:09.570 --> 42:11.877
I'm neither of those things.

42:11.877 --> 42:15.358
What he is
is a very busy husband.

42:15.358 --> 42:18.753
Carvens, why don't you show us
what you have so far?

42:18.753 --> 42:20.538
Okay, uh, okay.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.583
It's not finished yet.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.455
Uh, I still have
some background to do.

42:28.284 --> 42:30.460
I hope you like it.

42:30.460 --> 42:33.986
I do think it's the best work
I've ever done.

42:54.789 --> 43:00.099
I-I hope you don't mind,
but this is how I see you.

43:00.099 --> 43:02.754
A-- A man
of many contradictions.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.059
You know, good and evil.

43:04.059 --> 43:06.322
You think
my husband is evil?

43:06.322 --> 43:09.325
I see duality in every person,
even myself.

43:09.325 --> 43:10.718
When I was a drug addict,

43:10.718 --> 43:12.415
I did things to myself
and others

43:12.415 --> 43:14.461
that I would consider evil.

43:14.461 --> 43:17.769
And as a supplier of drugs,
I'm sure you feel the same way.

43:19.335 --> 43:21.163
Go fuck yourself!

43:21.163 --> 43:22.991
How dare you?!

43:22.991 --> 43:25.080
We paid money for this shit?

43:25.080 --> 43:27.082
For this insult?

43:31.521 --> 43:35.003
You don't know shit about me

43:35.003 --> 43:38.180
and I could give a fuck
about your two-bit psychology.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.797
I grew up
with chumps like you.

43:45.797 --> 43:48.582
You blame me
for <i>your</i> weakness.

43:50.715 --> 43:53.892
You blame drugs,
you blame society.

43:57.156 --> 43:59.114
Look at yourself.

44:01.464 --> 44:07.253
You ain't nothing but
a fucking talentless junkie.

44:10.169 --> 44:12.606
Pay him the rest of his money.
I'm out of here.

44:16.349 --> 44:18.525
I'm sorry.

44:19.744 --> 44:22.616
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

44:56.041 --> 44:59.000
Thank you
for meeting with me.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.654
<i>I</i> should be thanking <i>you.</i>

45:03.570 --> 45:06.616
I'm still not sure
if I can trust you, Omar.

45:06.616 --> 45:08.401
I can understand that.

45:08.401 --> 45:10.011
What I've written
are just words.

45:10.011 --> 45:12.448
They can only do so much.

45:12.448 --> 45:16.844
You need to see those words
in action.

45:16.844 --> 45:20.065
That's true, but words
are also important.

45:22.589 --> 45:26.898
I wish I could put into words
all that I'm feeling,

45:26.898 --> 45:30.118
but I'm afraid I can't.

45:30.118 --> 45:32.251
You see,
I have to admit something.

45:32.251 --> 45:33.600
Putting you to the test
is one thing.

45:33.600 --> 45:37.038
And I intend to do that.

45:37.038 --> 45:39.780
But I have to put myself
to the test, too.

45:39.780 --> 45:41.651
In what way?

45:41.651 --> 45:44.611
I loved you once.

45:44.611 --> 45:47.614
I believed in you.

45:47.614 --> 45:51.139
I thought the feelings
in my heart were real.

45:51.139 --> 45:53.228
When you imagine a life
with someone,

45:53.228 --> 45:56.231
you create a future
in your mind.

45:56.231 --> 45:57.580
And even
if those feelings die,

45:57.580 --> 45:59.931
that future
still lives on somewhere.

45:59.931 --> 46:03.151
In mine, too, Elise.

46:03.151 --> 46:04.587
I didn't dare mention that.

46:04.587 --> 46:07.503
What are you
really after, Omar?

46:07.503 --> 46:11.594
Me or the cause?

46:14.815 --> 46:18.384
I believe in what Malcolm
is doing with all my heart.

46:20.952 --> 46:22.475
But I'm not gonna lie to you, Elise.

46:22.475 --> 46:24.825
I still love you.
I do.

46:24.825 --> 46:28.133
I can't help it.

46:28.133 --> 46:30.483
This isn't about us.

46:30.483 --> 46:32.833
It can't ever be.

46:32.833 --> 46:35.270
This is about the cause.

46:35.270 --> 46:38.534
This is about Malcolm
and his mission.

46:38.534 --> 46:39.797
About the fate
of our people.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.102
About justice
and equality.

46:41.102 --> 46:42.495
This is about everything
that is

46:42.495 --> 46:43.801
so much more important
than you or me.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.672
Do you understand that?
I do.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.940
What's that?

46:52.940 --> 46:55.377
The Holy Quran.

46:55.377 --> 46:57.815
I'm gonna make you swear
on it.

46:57.815 --> 47:00.687
I want you to swear that
you will never do anything

47:00.687 --> 47:02.428
to harm Malcolm.

47:06.432 --> 47:11.350
I swear before Allah,
and on pain of death.

47:13.352 --> 47:15.397
Now it's your turn.

47:15.397 --> 47:17.835
Swear you don't love me anymore.

47:22.187 --> 47:24.058
I'm not ready
for that just yet.

47:40.727 --> 47:42.424
Pettigrew.

47:42.424 --> 47:43.904
Sorry I'm late.

47:43.904 --> 47:46.428
Hey.
You got the stuff?

47:46.428 --> 47:48.213
You got the money?

47:48.213 --> 47:50.345
Yeah, I got the money, man.
I got the money right here.

47:50.345 --> 47:52.217
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:52.217 --> 47:54.088
- Lemme see the coke.
- It's in the car.

47:54.088 --> 47:56.569
Alright, well,
then go get it.

47:56.569 --> 47:58.005
- Okay.
- Yeah.

47:58.005 --> 48:00.355
Alright.

48:00.355 --> 48:03.358
You know, I got somebody
I want you to meet.

48:03.358 --> 48:06.405
Whoa.
What the fuck you doing, man?

48:06.405 --> 48:08.537
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

48:08.537 --> 48:09.887
What's she doing here?

48:09.887 --> 48:11.192
I found out
how you got my name.

48:11.192 --> 48:13.542
Come on, man.
Let her go, man.

48:13.542 --> 48:14.761
Go ahead and tell him.

48:14.761 --> 48:15.936
Tell him!

48:15.936 --> 48:17.938
He's my husband.

48:17.938 --> 48:21.376
Okay, l-listen, I-I didn't
know that was your wife, okay?

48:21.376 --> 48:22.638
Reuben, I just want
to do business--

48:22.638 --> 48:24.466
You're gonna gimme
that fuckin' 3 grand

48:24.466 --> 48:26.642
or I'm gonna kill her.

48:26.642 --> 48:29.384
That's the price you owe me
for fucking my wife, yeah?

48:29.384 --> 48:31.038
What the fuck you doing, man?

48:31.038 --> 48:33.736
I'll blow this fucking <i>puta's</i>
head off in three seconds.

48:33.736 --> 48:35.477
Three...

48:35.477 --> 48:37.218
two...

48:37.218 --> 48:39.264
one--
Whoa, whoa! Okay, okay.

48:39.264 --> 48:40.961
Here. Alright?

48:40.961 --> 48:42.963
You want the money,
take the money.

48:42.963 --> 48:44.225
Now let her go.
Come on.

48:44.225 --> 48:45.748
- Let her go?
- Yeah. Let her go.

48:45.748 --> 48:46.967
- So you can fuck her again?
- Come on.

48:46.967 --> 48:48.447
I don't think so.

48:48.447 --> 48:49.839
- Now, I know you're packin'.
- Come on, man.

48:49.839 --> 48:51.232
Toss over your piece, yeah?

48:51.232 --> 48:52.930
Alright.
I'm gonna reach for it, okay?

48:52.930 --> 48:54.801
Don't do nothing stupid, man, alright?

48:55.845 --> 48:57.064
Fuck! Aah!

49:02.635 --> 49:04.115
Hey.

49:04.115 --> 49:05.159
You okay?

49:05.159 --> 49:06.334
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

49:06.334 --> 49:07.683
- Yeah.
- Come on. Get up.

49:14.125 --> 49:16.431
Now what are you doing?

49:20.827 --> 49:22.524
Goddamn.

49:24.874 --> 49:26.964
Look at that.

49:26.964 --> 49:28.574
It's beautiful.

49:31.838 --> 49:35.146
I guess we both lied
to each other.

49:35.146 --> 49:37.278
You didn't tell me
you had a husband,

49:37.278 --> 49:40.542
and I told you
I wasn't a gangster.

49:40.542 --> 49:41.674
Adiós, chica.

50:07.787 --> 50:09.702
So now you're gonna
fix yourself some booze?

50:09.702 --> 50:11.747
- You gonna start drinking again?
- I don't wanna hear it, alright?

50:11.747 --> 50:14.054
What you did to that boy's
painting was wrong.

50:14.054 --> 50:15.577
What has gotten into you?

50:15.577 --> 50:18.058
He was insulting me!

50:18.058 --> 50:19.755
He is an artist!

50:19.755 --> 50:22.541
It is how he sees you.

50:22.541 --> 50:26.153
And I am beginning to think
he is not far from right.

50:26.153 --> 50:28.851
What's
that supposed to mean?

50:28.851 --> 50:30.549
I think you know.

50:32.551 --> 50:35.380
You don't want me to be
in the heroin business?

50:35.380 --> 50:36.946
Is that it?

50:36.946 --> 50:39.601
It's not good for you,
for your-- for your--

50:39.601 --> 50:41.212
for your image,

50:41.212 --> 50:46.695
for your political
work?

50:47.957 --> 50:51.961
No, it is not good for me.

50:51.961 --> 50:55.052
It is not good for anything
but money!

50:55.052 --> 50:58.055
Well,
so now you get your wish.

50:58.055 --> 51:00.448
I lost the duji to Colombo.

51:00.448 --> 51:02.711
Now if I wanna sell it,
I got to buy it from him.

51:02.711 --> 51:07.412
Like-- Like I did
when I was a nobody.

51:07.412 --> 51:09.109
A nothing.

51:12.678 --> 51:14.288
I mean...

51:19.076 --> 51:22.818
Drug addicts are addicted
to dope.

51:22.818 --> 51:26.213
And drug dealers are addicted
to selling it.

51:32.828 --> 51:35.396
Okay, Ronnie, you got
two keys coming your way.

51:35.396 --> 51:39.226
You put 50% down,
rest is on commission.

51:39.226 --> 51:41.141
You got it, boss.

51:41.141 --> 51:43.622
Anybody hear from
Bumpy Johnson yet?

51:43.622 --> 51:46.233
Not yet.
The other Black gangs in Harlem

51:46.233 --> 51:48.757
are already puttin' in
orders without him.

51:48.757 --> 51:50.803
None of his men
have approached you?

51:50.803 --> 51:52.587
Nah.

51:52.587 --> 51:53.849
Strange.

51:56.069 --> 51:59.116
Without heroin, all of his
businesses will start to fail.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.682
He's too smart
for that shit.

52:00.682 --> 52:02.423
Who needs
Bumpy Fuckin' Johnson?

52:02.423 --> 52:04.599
Word's out on the street
about this dope.

52:04.599 --> 52:07.298
Junkies are crawling
all over themselves to get it.
