CHRIS ROCK:
Out of all the girls
I liked growing up,

00:06.540 --> 00:07.775
the one that got to me
the most...

00:07.808 --> 00:09.710
...was Tasha.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.412
Boy, you so crazy.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.581
She was cute,
she liked my jokes,

00:13.614 --> 00:15.549
but the most important thing
about her

00:15.583 --> 00:17.585
was that she was
the girl next door.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.752
I'll see you later.

00:18.786 --> 00:19.887
Yeah, see you.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.623
Like real estate,
Tasha's biggest selling point

00:22.656 --> 00:25.293
was location,
location, location.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.828
I think I'm going to get Tasha
to be my girlfriend.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.330
Wow, what a coincidence.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.065
How's that?
I think I'm gonna get

00:31.099 --> 00:32.666
Janet Jackson
to be my girlfriend,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.368
and once we both achieve
the impossible,

00:34.402 --> 00:35.803
we can go
on a double date.

00:35.836 --> 00:36.804
We'll go
to the Playboy Mansion.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.806
And the girls will leave
with Pauly Shore.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.541
I'm serious, man, I
don't care what it takes.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.675
I'm going to get her.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.677
That line was spoken
by many people,

00:43.711 --> 00:44.878
most notably O.J. Simpson.

00:44.912 --> 00:47.681
I mean, I don't know why I've
been running all around town

00:47.715 --> 00:49.683
when there's a girl right
next door ready to be plucked.

00:49.717 --> 00:50.851
What if she doesn't want you
to pluck her?

00:50.884 --> 00:51.752
Somebody's got
to pluck her.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.454
What if somebody else
already plucked her?

00:53.487 --> 00:54.488
I don't care
who's plucked her.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.124
She's gonna get
plucked by me.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.758
I wish there was
somebody I could pluck.

00:57.791 --> 01:01.095
Thank goodness these guys
are good with enunciation.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.596
I don't know why
I waited so long.

01:02.630 --> 01:03.664
I don't know,
maybe there's a reason

01:03.697 --> 01:04.465
you haven't gotten
with her.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.766
Maybe you're just
not supposed to be

01:05.799 --> 01:07.201
together.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.202
That's impossible.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.203
All right?

01:09.237 --> 01:11.572
She kissed me
on New Year's Eve.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.606
We were together
for Easter.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.508
She even got jealous
when I kissed that other girl

01:14.542 --> 01:16.810
while we were playing
spin the bottle.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.780
As far as I'm concerned,
all the signs are saying "go."

01:19.813 --> 01:21.349
But they don't say where to.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.550
What if she says no?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.318
Then I'll be
back here with you,

01:24.352 --> 01:27.355
but I'm going to have her
in my life or out.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.424
Oh, I can't imagine
how this might turn out.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.207
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.364
Tasha, wait up.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.200
Since Tasha was
right next door,

02:12.233 --> 02:14.868
it was easy to find
the right time to make my move.

02:14.902 --> 02:15.869
Hey, Chris.

02:15.903 --> 02:16.904
Look at you,
looking all cute.

02:16.937 --> 02:20.174
What you got, some girl
you're trying to impress?

02:20.208 --> 02:21.642
Yeah... you.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.611
:
Boy, you so crazy.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.313
Oh, I'm crazy all right.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.648
Tasha, I'm not crazy.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.184
I'm serious.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.419
* I just lose my nerve...

02:31.452 --> 02:32.853
I want to say
something to you,

02:32.886 --> 02:34.522
but I want to make it
very, very clear.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.523
Okay.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.690
What is it?

02:36.724 --> 02:37.891
I want you to be
my girlfriend.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.661
I'm already your
girl friend.

02:40.694 --> 02:44.865
No, not in like a friend who
just so happens to be a girl

02:44.898 --> 02:46.800
or like "Hey, girlfriend."

02:46.834 --> 02:50.838
No, I want you
to be my girlfriend.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.406
One word,
not two.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.374
Girlfriend,
as in

02:53.407 --> 02:55.709
"Chris and Tasha
are boyfriend and girlfriend."

02:55.743 --> 02:58.546
You want me to be
your girlfriend?

02:58.579 --> 02:59.780
Exactly.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.216
Hmm...

03:02.250 --> 03:03.951
Let me think about it.

03:03.984 --> 03:07.488
I'd have a much better chance
if she didn't think about it.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.957
Superior Court of New Jersey?

03:09.990 --> 03:11.892
While I was getting things
out in the open,

03:11.925 --> 03:15.996
my mother found a skeleton
in the closet.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.400
Julius... married...
Tawny... what?!

03:19.433 --> 03:20.901
Can't nobody stand you

03:20.934 --> 03:22.770
'cause you're a liar
and you won't shut up.

03:22.803 --> 03:23.937
Shut don't go
up, prices do,

03:23.971 --> 03:25.773
so take my advice
and shut up, too.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.007
You shut up,
I grow up.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.609
Every time I see your face,
I throw up.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.578
Shut up.
The Junior Varsity
Sugar Hill Gang.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.812
Will both of
you shut up?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.247
I swear.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.282
That doesn't rhyme.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.285
Y'all couldn't be quiet
if somebody paid you.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.786
I could.
No, you couldn't.

03:38.819 --> 03:39.953
You couldn't shut up
to save your life.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.822
Quiet! Here.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.024
Here's your allowance
for this week.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.493
Okay?

03:45.526 --> 03:47.595
The next one that talks
loses theirs.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.762
Winner gets it all.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.972
While Drew and Tonya
were keeping their mouths shut,

03:59.006 --> 04:01.575
back at school
I was waiting for the word.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.478
And then I said that would
involve kissing and touching--

04:04.512 --> 04:05.679
well, I ran it down.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.316
Oh, man, you are going
to be so in there.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.750
I can't believe
you ran it down.

04:09.783 --> 04:10.784
I would have just ran.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.085
What'd she say?

04:12.119 --> 04:14.588
She said she'll think
about it.
Well, what
does that mean?

04:14.622 --> 04:16.957
It means
"Let me check every option,

04:16.990 --> 04:18.792
"see if I can get
someone I want,

04:18.826 --> 04:20.694
and if not,
I'll go out with you."

04:20.728 --> 04:24.398
And when she said every option,
she meant every option.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.434
She checked blind guys.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.001
Do you have
a girlfriend?

04:28.035 --> 04:29.337
Yeah, girl.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.039
What are you, blind?

04:32.072 --> 04:33.341
She checked dangerous guys.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.742
Do you have
a girlfriend?

04:34.775 --> 04:35.809
Yeah, he does.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.711
Now, give me your money.
Don't move.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.547
She even checked guys
who were girls.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.882
Do you have a girlfriend?

04:41.915 --> 04:45.419
I'm my own girlfriend.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.388
While I was waiting
to get my woman,

04:47.421 --> 04:49.523
my father's woman was waiting
to get him.

04:49.557 --> 04:50.891
Hey, baby.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.894
Why didn't you tell me you
were married to someone else?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.633
Huh?
Now would be
a good time to run.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.436
Don't "huh?" me.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.405
Tawny Reynolds?

05:04.438 --> 05:06.073
Does the name ring a bell?

05:06.106 --> 05:07.875
You better say something.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.377
She might have a gun.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.378
Yeah.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.613
Um...

05:13.647 --> 05:15.916
It was a long time ago.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.018
It was a long time
before I even met you.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.455
I was 17 in
Atlantic City,

05:21.489 --> 05:23.657
and we were drunk.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.493
We got married.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.127
Four days later,
we were divorced.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.030
Story of Britney Spears' life.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.366
Well, not according to this.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.637
"Complaint for divorce"?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.707
:
That's crazy, huh?

05:39.740 --> 05:42.376
I mean, because how could
somebody divorce you

05:42.410 --> 05:44.812
unless you're
married to them?

05:44.845 --> 05:47.114
This has got to be a mistake.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.549
What marriage isn't?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.518
You know, Julius...

05:50.551 --> 05:53.153
you know how much
a lightbulb costs per watt.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.756
How can you
not know

05:55.789 --> 05:58.859
that you have another wife?!

05:58.892 --> 06:00.994
Because those things
are less complicated.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.163
I do not have another wife.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.665
Yes, you do!

06:04.698 --> 06:07.801
Look, look, look, it
says so right there!

06:07.835 --> 06:08.802
You know what?

06:08.836 --> 06:10.438
What I want
to know is:

06:10.471 --> 06:12.806
if she's your wife,
then what am I?

06:12.840 --> 06:13.807
You're my wife.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.009
No!

06:16.043 --> 06:18.412
I'm your concubine!

06:18.446 --> 06:19.480
This is silly.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.082
Is she white?

06:22.115 --> 06:23.116
What?

06:23.150 --> 06:24.117
No.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.118
Can she get
the house?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.987
Rochelle...
Is she white?

06:27.020 --> 06:27.988
Stop it.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.122
Do you have a
kid with her?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.123
Is she white?

06:30.157 --> 06:31.124
No.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.493
Is the kid
light

06:32.526 --> 06:33.961
No.
Ha!

06:33.994 --> 06:36.664
So you admit that
you have a kid!

06:36.697 --> 06:39.066
Oh, God, I'm
going to be sick!

06:39.099 --> 06:40.668
There is no kid.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.703
How do you know, Julius?

06:42.736 --> 06:45.205
You didn't even know
that you didn't have a divorce!

06:45.238 --> 06:46.974
Oh, my God.

06:47.007 --> 06:50.010
W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-What's going
to happen to this family

06:50.043 --> 06:53.146
if it turns out
there's another one?

06:53.180 --> 06:57.985
Kids, I'd like to introduce you
to your new mother Tawny

06:58.018 --> 07:00.588
and your new brother Julian.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.957
Girl, you just wasted
$2.17 worth of white meat.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.659
JULIUS:
My boy.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.132
What am I going to
say to my children?

07:12.165 --> 07:13.767
The kids are going
to be all right.

07:13.801 --> 07:14.768
Look, look...

07:14.802 --> 07:17.104
Oh... don't touch me!

07:17.137 --> 07:19.139
We'll leave them
out of this.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.642
Listen, I-I'm gonna
sign these papers

07:21.675 --> 07:23.777
and take these to
the courtroom myself

07:23.811 --> 07:24.778
and get this
straightened out.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.747
You do that.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.148
Because if you don't
straighten out

07:28.181 --> 07:29.917
what's going on
in these papers,

07:29.950 --> 07:31.585
you're going
to get a set of papers

07:31.619 --> 07:34.454
that look just like them.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.893
And she better
not be white.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.832
While my father tried
to explain

07:44.865 --> 07:46.166
why he had two women,

07:46.199 --> 07:49.069
I wanted to find out
if I had one.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.571
Hey, Chris.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.040
Oh, hey, Tasha, listen about
what I said yesterday...

07:53.073 --> 07:54.241
I thought about it.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.242
Yes.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.944
Yes, what?
Yes,

07:56.977 --> 07:58.145
I will be your girlfriend.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.014
And I get to
touch you?
Yes.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.183
In an 8:00 p.m. sitcom
kind of way.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.285
And I get to kiss you?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.655
Yes.
Ask for more, ask for more!

08:07.688 --> 08:08.889
In front of other people--

08:08.922 --> 08:10.691
not just strangers,
even people we know?

08:10.724 --> 08:12.192
Yes.
And if anybody
asks me,

08:12.225 --> 08:16.697
I can say, "Yes, Tasha
is my girlfriend"?

08:16.730 --> 08:18.198
Yes.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.267
All right.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.935
I need you
to sign this.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.037
I need your
thumbprint there.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.676
All right, now,
turn that around.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.811
Smile.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.047
Thank you.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.115
Who's this?

08:35.148 --> 08:36.917
She's notary public.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.319
There.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.320
Here you go.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.055
It's official, Chris.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.558
Tasha is your girlfriend.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.629
Somebody record this

08:48.662 --> 08:51.098
so she can't lie
and say it didn't happen.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.305
After years of walking
out my door feeling down,

08:58.338 --> 08:59.840
with Tasha right next door,

08:59.873 --> 09:01.274
I was walking out
and getting felt up.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.343
Happy anniversary.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.045
Anniversary?

09:05.078 --> 09:07.080
Yes, we've been
together a week.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.349
Here, I made you this bookmark
with our names on it.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.686
Oh... thanks.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.789
So what'd you get me?

09:15.823 --> 09:18.291
A big box of nothing.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.127
Nothing.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.329
I didn't know we celebrated
one-week anniversaries.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.298
Oh... that's okay.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.834
What she really meant was...

09:26.867 --> 09:28.602
MAN:
Oh, my God.

09:28.636 --> 09:32.372
This is the worst catastrophe.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.008
CHRIS ROCK:
I found out pretty quickly
that getting a girlfriend

09:35.042 --> 09:37.277
was a lot easier
than keeping her happy.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.980
Hey, you want to get together
later and watch some videos?

09:40.013 --> 09:42.683
I loved watching videos
with Tasha.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.985
* I got a paper and pencil

09:45.018 --> 09:47.855
* Thinking of rhymes
like mental... *

09:47.888 --> 09:49.757
Nah, that's okay.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.892
I also learned that before
we did what I liked to do,

09:51.925 --> 09:54.327
we had to something
she liked to do.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.230
Come here, girl, you
know I'm just playing.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.666
I got a surprise
for you later.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.400
You do.
What is it?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.002
It's a surprise to me, too.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.737
Well, I wanted to
wait until later,

10:03.771 --> 10:06.173
but, you know, after I
get home from school,

10:06.206 --> 10:07.675
I wanted to
celebrate with you.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.308
I'll bring your
present then.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.342
Good one.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.911
Ooh, and then we can go
to Mr. Woo's

10:10.944 --> 10:12.345
and get some Chinese food.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.380
Oh, and then I can tell you

10:13.413 --> 10:15.849
all about what this crazy girl
said to me at school

10:15.883 --> 10:17.084
and then we can talk
about what we're...

10:17.117 --> 10:18.385
Another thing I learned quickly

10:18.418 --> 10:22.422
is that, much like Bin Laden,
girlfriends like to make plans,

10:22.455 --> 10:25.826
and those plans
did not include Greg.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.395
Hey, what happened
to you yesterday?

10:28.428 --> 10:29.930
We were supposed to
go see Lethal Weapon.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.364
Oh, I was out with Tasha.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.265
Oh.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.034
Well, do you want
to go see it today?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.302
I can't.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.269
Why, you got
to go to work?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.038
No, me and Tasha
are going down to Al B Square

10:38.071 --> 10:39.406
to get matching
T-shirts made.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.473
More like matching blouses.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.943
Then we're going to the
photo booth to get pictures

10:42.976 --> 10:44.111
and then we're gonna get
something to eat.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.046
I knew this was
going to happen.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.715
What?
Don't you see?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.082
She's taking
over your life.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.084
She's got you running
around in matching clothes.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.720
It's like you're a
life-size Ken doll.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.722
I have one thing Ken doesn't.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.723
So what?

10:55.756 --> 10:56.356
Okay, I got
a girlfriend.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.390
What are you, jealous?

10:57.424 --> 10:58.826
Of course, I'm jealous.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.694
But this isn't about
me; it's about you.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.162
I thought you were
gonna be so in there.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.697
Turns out you can't
get out of there.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.132
It's like you're a
puppet and she's got

11:05.165 --> 11:06.867
her hand stuck
up your...
Hey.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.206
She did?

11:13.240 --> 11:14.474
Yeah.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.676
Twice.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.713
Meanwhile, Drew and Tonya

11:19.747 --> 11:22.349
continued their war
of no words.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.424
Drew went to the Ike Turner
School of Sign Language.

11:31.458 --> 11:35.362
To save his marriage,
my father had to get a divorce.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.767
How could you not know
that you're not divorced?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.769
I signed the papers
and sent them back to her.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.737
How was I supposed to know
she didn't file them?

11:43.771 --> 11:45.172
Because you didn't get
your final decree.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.874
I didn't know I needed
a final decree.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.742
Well, you
should have.

11:48.776 --> 11:49.843
Who knows what this woman

11:49.877 --> 11:51.278
might have been
doing in your name?

11:51.311 --> 11:52.780
She could have been
holding up banks,

11:52.813 --> 11:54.081
taking out loans.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.115
Invading Iraq?

11:55.148 --> 11:56.116
Did you have

11:56.149 --> 11:57.517
any kids with her?
No.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.119
Is she white?

11:59.152 --> 12:00.954
No, she is not white.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.990
Hmm.
Listen,

12:03.023 --> 12:05.793
let me throw a hypothetical
situation at you.

12:05.826 --> 12:06.927
This should be good.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.095
Say there
was a person

12:08.128 --> 12:09.296
who thought he
was divorced...

12:09.329 --> 12:10.497
A person?

12:10.530 --> 12:13.033
A person...
and that person

12:13.066 --> 12:15.002
went and got married again
and had some kids.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.504
Then, he got some papers
that said he was still married

12:17.537 --> 12:19.272
to another person.
Hypothetically.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.274
Hypothetically.
Well,

12:21.308 --> 12:24.978
that person could be arrested
and hypothetically sent to jail

12:25.012 --> 12:26.013
as a bigamist.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.547
Or just move to Utah.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.350
Does this mean that person's
current marriage is not valid?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.552
Hypothetically, no,

12:32.585 --> 12:35.856
but between you, me
and your hypothetical friend,

12:35.889 --> 12:38.291
as long as he
files these papers

12:38.325 --> 12:39.526
and gets his final decree

12:39.559 --> 12:42.162
and everyone here stays lazy,
he'll be fine.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.197
That's good news.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.465
Hypothetically.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.500
Mm-hmm.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.536
Can I ask you
a hypothetical question?

12:49.569 --> 12:50.838
Yeah.

12:50.871 --> 12:51.972
Is she white?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.809
No, she is not white.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.545
We'll mail the divorce decree
in a few days.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.317
When a guy has a girlfriend,
he wants to get her alone.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.552
You want to get
together tonight

13:05.585 --> 13:06.820
and watch some videos?

13:06.854 --> 13:08.088
But when a girl
has a boyfriend,

13:08.121 --> 13:09.422
she wants to show him around.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.858
Can we go
to Yvette's first?

13:10.891 --> 13:13.260
I want you to meet her
and Angela.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.561
When I got with Tasha,

13:14.594 --> 13:16.429
I thought I couldn't
get enough of her.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.965
So, we watching
videos tonight?

13:17.998 --> 13:19.432
Can I bring Rene
and Tina?

13:19.466 --> 13:22.836
What I found out
was I could barely get to her.

13:22.870 --> 13:26.273
While my father was waiting
for his final decree,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.575
my mother was acting
like it was over.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.544
Hey, baby.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.946
Does your wife know

13:32.980 --> 13:35.382
that you're hugging
up to another woman?

13:36.950 --> 13:37.918
What are you doing?

13:37.951 --> 13:39.352
Looking for
apartments.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.022
The kids and I need a place
that we can call our own.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.523
Rochelle, this
is your place.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.992
Really?

13:45.025 --> 13:47.260
Well, how do I know that
if you die right now,

13:47.294 --> 13:48.561
some white woman
wouldn't come

13:48.595 --> 13:50.931
and take your Social
Security, the house,

13:50.964 --> 13:53.233
the car, and me and the
kids be on the street?

13:53.266 --> 13:55.002
Who does she think he is,
James Brown?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.104
Look, I filed
the papers.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.205
This should all be over soon.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.206
Well, until then,

13:59.239 --> 14:00.440
you can sleep on the couch.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.047
After a few days of no luck
with getting it on,

14:07.080 --> 14:08.916
I decided to take a day off.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.918
Hey, you want to go
see Lethal Weapon?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.285
You're kidding me,
right?

14:12.319 --> 14:13.353
When?

14:13.386 --> 14:14.521
Now.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.956
Don't you have
to go meet more

14:15.989 --> 14:17.024
of Tasha's girlfriends?

14:17.057 --> 14:19.326
Nah, man, I'm
done with that.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.529
So, uh, you guys
check out any videos?

14:22.562 --> 14:23.663
I wish.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.099
Look, until we start doing
something that I want to do,

14:26.133 --> 14:27.968
I'm gonna do stuff
that I want to do.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.636
I'm gonna call Doc
and tell him I'm gonna

14:29.669 --> 14:31.071
come in tomorrow
instead of today.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.373
Surprise!

14:33.406 --> 14:34.541
Hey, honey.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.575
Hey, Greg.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.643
What are you doing here?

14:36.676 --> 14:39.312
I was thinking we could go
to the movies, you know,

14:39.346 --> 14:40.914
maybe see Fatal Attraction
with Yvette and Rhonda.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.950
I got to work.

14:42.983 --> 14:43.850
No, you don't.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.285
I told Doc you weren't
coming in today

14:45.318 --> 14:46.653
because I had plans.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.255
What? You can't just go
to my job

14:48.288 --> 14:49.656
and tell them I'm not coming in.

14:49.689 --> 14:50.958
Why not?

14:50.991 --> 14:52.692
'Cause I can't just go
to your school

14:52.725 --> 14:54.627
and say, "She's not coming in
because I got plans."

14:54.661 --> 14:56.329
What are you
trying to say?

14:56.363 --> 14:58.465
Why is it that whenever I want
to do something,

14:58.498 --> 15:00.533
it has to wait till tomorrow,
but whenever you want

15:00.567 --> 15:02.402
to do something,
it has to happen right now?

15:02.435 --> 15:04.471
What does that have
to do with anything?

15:04.504 --> 15:07.107
Welcome to Women's Logic 101.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.042
I just don't want you
running my life.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.510
You're the
one who said

15:10.543 --> 15:12.545
you wanted me to be
your girlfriend.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.081
Well, maybe I
was better off alone.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.949
Are you saying you're
breaking up with me?

15:15.983 --> 15:17.617
Let me make this
perfectly clear.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.419
Yes.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.654
I want to break up with you.

15:21.688 --> 15:22.522
What?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.324
You think you can
just say good-bye,

15:24.357 --> 15:25.658
walk away and
it's over?

15:25.692 --> 15:26.659
Yeah.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.228
Watch.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.929
Bye.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.336
The best thing
about the girl next door

15:36.369 --> 15:37.971
is she's right next door.

15:38.005 --> 15:41.608
And the worst thing
is that she's right next door.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.676
I will not be ignored, Chris.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.679
I'm lucky I don't
have a pet rabbit.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.719
CHRIS ROCK:
Since I was playing the game
of love,

15:52.752 --> 15:54.654
I decided to get advice
from a real player.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.223
No, you got to move.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.424
Why?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.426
She lives
right next door, Chris.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.627
Where are you gonna go?

16:00.660 --> 16:02.195
You'll never get
away from her.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.463
We broke up.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.664
You broke up.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.499
That's like
telling the IRS

16:06.533 --> 16:07.734
you don't owe them any money.

16:07.767 --> 16:11.038
It ain't over
till they say it's over.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.372
Ask Wesley Snipes.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.773
I can't move.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.542
Well, you better
get back together.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.310
See, I don't
get this.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.745
How is it that she's
the one acting crazy

16:18.778 --> 16:20.513
and I have to be the one
to work things out?

16:20.547 --> 16:23.150
Because she started
acting crazy first.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.385
She's using your
reason against you.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.520
You know that makes
no sense, right?

16:27.554 --> 16:30.390
Welcome to Women's Logic 201.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.792
Before I had a chance
to confront my problem,

16:32.825 --> 16:35.028
my problem confronted me.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.496
Hey, Chris.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.797
ROCHELLE:
Where have you been?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.166
JULIUS:
You invited Tasha
over for dinner,

16:39.199 --> 16:40.800
and you got the girl
waiting on you?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.235
Well, if anybody
knows what it's like

16:42.269 --> 16:44.104
to have a girl waiting
on them, you do.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.538
Tasha, can I talk to you
for a minute?

16:45.572 --> 16:46.739
Sure, honey.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.077
And by "minute",
I mean "never again."

16:50.110 --> 16:51.711
Tasha, go home.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.113
It's over.

16:53.146 --> 16:56.083
I put the last few weeks
of my life into you,

16:56.116 --> 16:58.118
and I'm not gonna let you
throw it all away

16:58.151 --> 16:59.219
over a little fight.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.088
I just said it's over.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.822
You wanted me, you got me.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.492
You're my boyfriend
until I say you're not.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.626
Got that?

17:06.659 --> 17:09.362
And that is a love TKO.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.465
What's going on
with you and Tasha?

17:12.499 --> 17:14.101
I tried to break
up with her,

17:14.134 --> 17:14.767
but she wouldn't
let me.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.503
Well, there's
no such thing

17:16.536 --> 17:18.105
as trying to break
up with somebody.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.839
That's like being
a little pregnant.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.741
Either you're broken
up or you're not.

17:21.774 --> 17:24.177
But if you do want to
break up with her,

17:24.211 --> 17:25.312
let her know that.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.747
If you don't, make
sure she knows that.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.749
Don't have her
running around here

17:29.782 --> 17:31.784
thinking you're together
and you're not.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.321
One minute y'all having
a little fight,

17:34.354 --> 17:36.123
and the next thing you know,

17:36.156 --> 17:37.424
you're married with
a wife and kids

17:37.457 --> 17:39.092
and she's trying to
take your house.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.430
It seemed like my problems
were just beginning,

17:43.463 --> 17:46.065
but my father's
were finally ending.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.668
I got the final divorce papers.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.470
Really?

17:50.503 --> 17:52.839
Baby, I'm sorry for putting you
through all of this.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.675
You're the only woman
in the world I want to be with.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.210
Mm-hmm.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.413
And I was wondering...

18:00.447 --> 18:02.215
will you marry me?

18:02.249 --> 18:04.717
You're not married to
anyone else, are you?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.119
No, I'm not.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.856
Then, yes, I'll
marry you.

18:09.889 --> 18:13.460
* Glory halle-stupid!

18:13.493 --> 18:16.529
Yeah, bobbas, uh, yeah.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.799
Now, do you, Julius,
take Rochelle

18:19.832 --> 18:22.669
to be your...

18:22.702 --> 18:24.737
rhinestone rock star monster
of a doll baby bobba?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.773
I do.

18:26.806 --> 18:31.411
And Rochelle, do
you take Julius

18:31.444 --> 18:35.615
to be your rhinestone
rock star monster of a man?

18:35.648 --> 18:37.150
I do.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.851
With all the powers
invested

18:38.885 --> 18:41.821
in me and the blasters
of the universe,

18:41.854 --> 18:43.723
along with the mother ship
connection...

18:45.192 --> 18:48.728
...I now pronounce you...

18:48.761 --> 18:50.930
man...

18:50.963 --> 18:52.832
and wifey.

18:52.865 --> 18:53.933
Now...

18:53.966 --> 18:55.702
go funk her up.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.671
He said "funk", kids,
with an "N."

18:59.872 --> 19:01.374
Funk her up.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.376
* Do you want
to get funked up? *

19:03.410 --> 19:06.379
* Funk, yeah, funk her up

19:06.413 --> 19:08.715
* Don't you want
to get funked up? *

19:08.748 --> 19:11.251
While Bootsy and my parents
got funky,

19:11.284 --> 19:14.254
Drew decided to play dirty.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.788
Oh, my God, Drew!

19:15.822 --> 19:16.923
What happened?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.925
"Oh, my God, Drew,
what happened!"

19:18.958 --> 19:21.228
Ketchup-- I win.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.263
Cheater!

19:23.296 --> 19:25.665
After everything
I'd been through with Tasha

19:25.698 --> 19:28.968
and as crazy as she acted,
she really did have a point.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.338
Breaking up over one fight
wasn't worth it.

19:31.371 --> 19:34.807
And if she didn't think it
was over, then it wasn't over.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.909
Oh, Chris.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.378
Hey.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.380
I was mad earlier.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.548
I noticed.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.683
It's not that I want
to break up with you.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.319
I just think we need
to get clear about some things.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.787
Like what?

19:47.820 --> 19:48.855
First of all,

19:48.888 --> 19:51.458
you cannot cancel my work
so we can go hang out.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.925
Okay.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.927
And I'm sorry
that I overreacted.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.397
I'm new to this
relationship stuff.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.932
Okay.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.668
Good.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.403
What's wrong?

20:03.436 --> 20:06.839
I am breaking up with you.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.842
I thought you said
that we were still together.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.011
Until I said we
were breaking up.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.946
We're breaking up.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.986
See ya, wouldn't want to be ya.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.488
Me, either.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.824
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:24.857 --> 20:28.461
