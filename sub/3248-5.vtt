00:01.120 --> 00:03.076
Doctor, it's Martha.

00:04.160 --> 00:05.878
And I'm bringing you back to Earth.

00:06.280 --> 00:09.033
52 deaths at the exact
same moment worldwide.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.633
They were all inside their cars.

00:10.720 --> 00:11.994
They were all fitted with Atmos.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.753
Atmos can be threaded through
any and every make of car.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.149
Get back.

00:16.239 --> 00:19.596
They've got poisonous gas
in every car on Earth.

00:19.960 --> 00:20.949
Sontaran!

00:21.040 --> 00:23.508
General Staal,
of the 1 Oth Sontaran fleet.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.792
- Oh, this is Ross. Say hello, Ross.
- Afternoon, sir.

00:32.479 --> 00:33.993
What is that?

00:34.080 --> 00:36.958
Soon, that will be you.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.475
Now we begin.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.949
Martha, tell Colonel Mace
it's the Sontarans.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.553
They're in the file. Code Red Sontarans.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.949
But if they're inside the factory,
tell them not to start shooting.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.268
UNIT will get massacred.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.112
Code Red Sontaran. Gotcha.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.270
- Found anything yet?
- Nothing to report.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.828
Prepare the subjugation of Earth.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.151
- Sontar-ha!
Sontar-ha!

00:58.600 --> 01:00.079
Doctor!

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.840 --> 01:40.796
Doctor! Doctor!

01:43.720 --> 01:45.199
It won't open!

01:51.280 --> 01:54.113
Well, don't just stand there.
Get him out.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.992
All soldiers to a door.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.038
Make the factory secure,
and take positions on the ground floor!

02:00.120 --> 02:02.793
Wicowsky, take the soldiers
into the factory.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.599
Make the area secure.
Seal off doors and windows.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.478
We've tried everything!
It just won't stop!

02:10.919 --> 02:11.909
What have we got?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.558
Atmos is running wild, sir.

02:13.640 --> 02:17.155
It can't be stopped. It's everywhere.
The whole planet.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.269
Thanks.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.669
- I can't believe you've got an axe.
- Burglars.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.069
Get inside the house. Just try
to close off the doors and windows.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.038
Doctor, this is all I could find
that hasn't got Atmos.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.270
- Donna, are you coming?
- Yeah.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.271
Donna, don't go!

02:49.360 --> 02:51.157
Look what happens every time
that Doctor appears.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.309
Stay with us, please.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.549
- You go, my darling.
- Dad!

02:53.640 --> 02:55.437
Don't listen to her!

02:55.600 --> 02:58.876
You go with the Doctor! That's my girl!

03:01.440 --> 03:02.714
Bye!

03:42.960 --> 03:45.633
Success. The operative has
the necessary information.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.473
Good work, for a female.
Now she must be protected.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.869
I will prepare an attack squad.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.997
This is it, isn't it?

03:55.680 --> 03:57.352
Oh, man, this is war!

03:57.440 --> 03:59.158
And how does it feel, boy?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.639
Magnificent.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.632
<i>The government has declared
a state of emergency.</i>

04:04.720 --> 04:09.475
<i>People are being told to stay away from
all cars with Atmos devices attached.</i>

04:09.560 --> 04:11.835
<i>The gas appears to be toxic.</i>

04:11.920 --> 04:15.230
<i>We are warning anyone and everyone,
stay away from the cars.</i>

04:15.320 --> 04:17.754
<i>Repeat, stay away from your cars.</i>

04:24.320 --> 04:26.072
Ross, look after yourself.
Get inside the building.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.434
Will do.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.153
Greyhound 40, this is Trap One.

04:29.240 --> 04:32.312
I've just returned the Doctor to base,
safe and sound. Over.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.356
Trap One, received. Over.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.115
Sir, a message from the Doctor.
He says Code Red Sontaran.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.630
All troops, Code Red Sontaran.
Code Red Sontaran.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.069
The air is disgusting.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.116
It's not so bad for me.
Go on, get inside the Tardis.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.760
Oh! I've never given you a key.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.070
Keep that. Go on, that's yours.
Quite a big moment, really.

04:52.160 --> 04:55.994
Yeah, maybe we'll get sentimental after
the world's finished choking to death.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.399
Good idea.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.799
Where are you going?

04:58.880 --> 05:00.518
To stop a war!

05:16.480 --> 05:17.469
Fine then, here I am!

05:17.560 --> 05:20.632
Good. Whatever you do, Colonel Mace,
do not engage the Sontarans in battle.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.358
There is nothing they like better
than a war.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.510
- Just leave this to me.
- And what are you going to do?

05:24.600 --> 05:28.275
I've got the Tardis.
I'm going to get on board their ship.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.474
Come on.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.477
Ready for transport.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.438
The spoils of war!

06:16.200 --> 06:19.715
The Doctor's infamous vessel
in Sontaran hands.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.118
It's time I made a move, sir.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.633
I have soldiers of my own.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.029
I'll tell them of the honour
and the glory, sir.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.918
I'll tell them the planetfall is coming.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.068
He is behaving
exactly as predicted, sir.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.391
None of the humans can guess
our true purpose.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.556
But where's the Tardis?

06:45.640 --> 06:47.551
Taste that, in the air.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.954
Blah, blah, that sort of metal tang.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.638
Teleport exchange.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.359
It's the Sontarans. They've taken it.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.028
I'm stuck on Earth, like...

07:02.480 --> 07:05.199
Like an ordinary person, like a human.
How rubbish is that?

07:05.280 --> 07:07.475
Sorry, no offence, but, come on!

07:07.560 --> 07:09.869
- So, what do we do?
- Well...

07:10.720 --> 07:13.678
I mean, it's shielded,
they could never detect it.

07:15.840 --> 07:16.875
What?

07:16.960 --> 07:18.871
I was just wondering,
have you phoned your family and Tom?

07:18.960 --> 07:20.029
No. What for?

07:20.120 --> 07:22.395
The gas. Tell them to stay inside.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.111
Course I will, yeah,
but what about Donna?

07:26.200 --> 07:27.235
I mean, where's she?

07:27.320 --> 07:29.754
Oh, she's gone home.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.951
She's not like you. She's not a soldier.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.270
<i>Right, so, avanti!</i>

07:44.720 --> 07:46.039
Leave it!

07:46.480 --> 07:47.799
Turn away!

07:48.600 --> 07:50.556
Civilisation is falling.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.995
But it's all over the news, sir.
It's everywhere.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.877
Paris and New York...

07:56.400 --> 07:58.834
It's time I told you. All of you!

07:59.160 --> 08:01.390
It's time I revealed what
our work has been for.

08:01.920 --> 08:02.989
Change of plan!

08:03.080 --> 08:04.672
Good to have you
fighting alongside us, Doctor.

08:04.760 --> 08:05.909
Not fighting.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.116
I'm not-fighting, as in
not-hyphen-fighting. Got it?

08:08.200 --> 08:10.634
Now, does anyone know
what this gas is yet?

08:10.720 --> 08:11.835
We're working on it.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.595
It's harmful, but not lethal
until it reaches 80 % density.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.513
We're having the first reports of deaths
from the centre of Tokyo city.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.919
Who are you?

08:20.000 --> 08:20.989
Captain Marion Price, sir.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.957
Oh, put your hand down. Don't salute.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.917
Jodrell Bank's traced
the signal, Doctor,

08:25.000 --> 08:26.672
coming from 5,000 miles
above the Earth.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.797
We're guessing that's what
triggered the cars.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.399
The Sontaran ship.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.914
NATO's gone to DEFCON 1.
We're preparing a strike.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.433
You can't do that. Nuclear missiles
won't even scratch the surface.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.509
Let me talk to the Sontarans.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.716
You're not authorised to speak
on behalf of the Earth.

08:39.799 --> 08:42.234
I've got that authority.
I earned that a long time ago.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.799
Calling the Sontaran command ship,

08:43.880 --> 08:47.156
under Jurisdiction 2 of
the Intergalactic Rules of Engagement.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.958
This is the Doctor.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.874
Doctor, I'm here! Can you hear me?

08:52.960 --> 08:55.679
Doctor, breathing your last?

08:55.960 --> 08:58.349
My God, they're like trolls.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.590
Yeah, loving the diplomacy, mate.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.353
So, tell me, General Staal,

09:04.440 --> 09:06.078
since when did you lot become cowards?

09:06.160 --> 09:08.071
<i>How dare you?</i>

09:08.160 --> 09:09.513
Oh, that's diplomacy.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.875
<i>Doctor, you impugn my honour!</i>

09:11.960 --> 09:14.394
Yeah, I'm really glad
you didn't say "belittle"

09:14.480 --> 09:16.118
'cause then I'd have a field day.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.829
But poison gas? That's the weapon of
a coward and you know it.

09:19.920 --> 09:23.196
Staal, you could blast this planet
out of the sky,

09:23.280 --> 09:25.953
and yet you're sitting up above
watching it die.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.029
<i>Where's the fight in that?</i>

09:27.120 --> 09:28.872
Where's the honour?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.838
Or, are you lot planning something else?

09:32.480 --> 09:34.198
<i>'Cause this isn't normal
Sontaran warfare.</i>

09:34.280 --> 09:35.679
<i>What are you lot up to?</i>

09:35.760 --> 09:39.799
A general would be unwise to reveal
his strategy to the opposing forces.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.475
Ah, the war's not going so well, then.
Losing, are we?

09:43.560 --> 09:46.279
- Such a suggestion is impossible!
- What war?

09:46.360 --> 09:49.079
The war between the Sontarans
and the Rutans.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.392
It's been raging, far out in the stars,
for 50,000 years.

09:53.480 --> 09:57.598
50,000 years of bloodshed, and for what?

09:57.680 --> 09:59.079
For victory.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.868
Sontar-ha! Sontara-ha!

10:01.960 --> 10:06.511
<i>Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha!
Sontar-ha! Sontara-ha!</i>

10:06.600 --> 10:08.238
Give me a break.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.478
<i>Boys and girls!</i>

10:10.880 --> 10:13.440
Doctor, I would seriously recommend
that this dialogue

10:13.520 --> 10:16.432
is handled by
official Earth representation.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.509
Finished?

10:17.600 --> 10:21.388
<i>You will not be so quick to ridicule
when you see our prize.</i>

10:21.640 --> 10:22.868
<i>Behold!</i>

10:23.480 --> 10:27.758
We are the first Sontarans in history
to capture a Tardis.

10:28.080 --> 10:33.108
Well, as prizes go, that's noble.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.708
<i>As they say in Latin, dona nobis pacem.</i>

10:37.880 --> 10:40.348
That's me. I'm here!

10:40.440 --> 10:42.795
<i>Did you never wonder about its design?
It's a phone box.</i>

10:42.880 --> 10:45.917
<i>It contains a phone,
a telephonic device for communication.</i>

10:46.000 --> 10:47.752
Sort of symbolic.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.912
<i>Like, if only we could communicate,
you and I.</i>

10:51.000 --> 10:53.468
<i>All you have communicated
is your distress, Doctor...</i>

10:53.560 --> 10:54.959
Oh, my God!

10:56.680 --> 10:59.035
Big mistake, though, showing it to me.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.439
But who do I phone?

11:00.520 --> 11:01.714
'Cause I've got a remote control.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.349
Cease transmission!

11:03.760 --> 11:04.795
Doctor, what number are you on?

11:07.520 --> 11:08.953
You haven't even got a number!

11:09.040 --> 11:13.033
Remove the box from the war room,
beyond the transmission field.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.550
Oh, well, that achieved nothing.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.596
Oh, you'd be surprised.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.833
But what do I do?

11:25.280 --> 11:27.396
All this stuff we've been building.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.792
All this invention,
where's it been heading?

11:32.000 --> 11:36.073
Gravity densifiers, hydroponics,
atmospheric conversion, eco-shells,

11:36.160 --> 11:39.038
more than enough to build
a brand new world.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.680
Luke, we haven't got time for this.
I've got to find my parents.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.433
Oh, but this isn't just theory.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.791
I'm talking planetfall, for all of us.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.348
A brand new start
for a brand new human race.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.589
Look.

11:55.040 --> 12:00.068
A new world, far out, beyond
Alpha Geminorum just waiting for us.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.720
Its official designation is Castor 36.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.429
I think of it as Earth-point-2.

12:07.800 --> 12:11.998
I did wonder about Rattigan's World,
but we can take a vote on that.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.877
What the hell are you on about?

12:13.960 --> 12:14.949
This is where we're going.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.156
I have partners
willing to take us there.

12:17.240 --> 12:20.357
Oh, he's lost it.
I haven't got time for this.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.670
Excuse me, I haven't finished.
Where are you going?

12:22.760 --> 12:24.637
- To find my brother.
- I didn't say you could leave.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.756
I told him to put Atmos in his car.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.671
I've got to go and help him.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.512
Stay where you are!

12:31.200 --> 12:32.428
What do you think you're doing?

12:32.520 --> 12:34.431
Luke, put that down.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.554
But...

12:37.480 --> 12:39.789
I did this for you. Don't you see?

12:39.880 --> 12:43.316
We've spent all our lives excluded,
the clever ones.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.314
They laughed at us and pulled us down,

12:46.400 --> 12:49.039
those ordinary people out there,
those cattle.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.676
This is our chance to leave them behind.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.875
You mean you want them dead?

12:54.960 --> 12:57.155
And I choose you to survive.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.273
With planetfall, we can start again.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.790
We can build and breed.
We can prosper. We can do anything!

13:05.880 --> 13:07.199
We're going to breed?

13:07.280 --> 13:08.872
I've designed a mating program.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.234
I've planned the whole thing.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.117
Well, then, shoot me.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.239
Stay where you are.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.038
Stay where you are, I said.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.669
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are! That's an order!

13:26.800 --> 13:28.153
Castor 36?

13:31.160 --> 13:32.832
You're just sick.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.590
I guess that just proves it.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.677
I'm cleverer than you!

13:41.040 --> 13:43.315
I'm cleverer than everyone!
Do you hear me?

13:43.400 --> 13:44.799
I'm clever!

13:44.920 --> 13:48.515
<i>The United Nations has issued
a directive worldwide,</i>

13:48.600 --> 13:51.831
<i>telling urban populations
to stay indoors.</i>

13:52.240 --> 13:56.916
<i>Those in rural areas are being ordered
to stay away from all major cities.</i>

13:57.200 --> 13:59.156
<i>There are reports from
every country in Europe</i>

13:59.240 --> 14:02.550
<i>of thousands of people walking
across country to escape.</i>

14:02.640 --> 14:07.589
<i>And on the Eastern Seaboard of America,
it's said to be reminiscent of Dunkirk,</i>

14:07.680 --> 14:10.797
<i>with boats taking refugees
out into the Atlantic.</i>

14:11.160 --> 14:15.119
<i>With the freeways blocked by Atmos cars,
populations of major cities</i>

14:15.200 --> 14:18.795
<i>are now walking across open country
to escape the fumes.</i>

14:18.960 --> 14:21.679
<i>It is being likened to
a Biblical plague.</i>

14:21.760 --> 14:24.433
<i>Some are calling this the End of Days.</i>

14:31.920 --> 14:33.956
<i>Mum, you all right?</i>

14:34.040 --> 14:36.110
Donna! Where are you, sweetheart?

14:36.200 --> 14:38.873
- Is that her?
- Oh, just finish the job.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.875
Your granddad's sealing us in.
He's sealing the windows.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.869
Our own house, and we're sealed in.

14:45.960 --> 14:50.158
All those things they said about
pollution and ozone and carbon,

14:50.240 --> 14:52.708
they're really happening, aren't they?

14:52.800 --> 14:55.951
There's people working on it, Mum.
They're gonna fix it, I promise.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.871
<i>Oh, like you'd know. You're so clever.</i>

14:57.960 --> 14:59.393
Oh, don't start.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.993
<i>Please, don't.</i>

15:01.240 --> 15:02.593
I'm sorry.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.475
I wish you were here.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.358
Oh, come on, Sylvia.
Look, that doesn't help.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.271
<i>Donna, where are you?</i>

15:11.800 --> 15:15.190
It's sort of hard to say. You all right?

15:15.280 --> 15:18.158
Yeah, fighting fit, yeah.
Is he with you, the Doctor?

15:18.240 --> 15:20.196
Oh, the Doctor.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.309
No.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.514
I'm all on my own.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.558
Look, you promised he was going to
look after you.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.312
He will, Gramps.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.119
There's something he needs me to do.
I just don't know what.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.474
Well, I mean,
the whole place is covered,

15:33.560 --> 15:36.950
the whole of London, they're saying,
and now the whole world.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.350
It's the scale of it, Donna.
I mean, how can one man stop all that?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.476
Trust me, he can do it.

15:43.080 --> 15:47.039
Yeah, well, if he doesn't, you tell him
he'll have to answer to me.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.788
I will.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.270
Just as soon as I see him.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.353
I'll tell him.

16:21.040 --> 16:25.670
Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons,
nitrogen oxides, but 10 % unidentified.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.069
Some sort of artificial heavy element
we can't trace.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.149
You ever seen anything like it?

16:29.240 --> 16:30.753
Must be something
the Sontarans invented.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.559
This isn't just poison.
They need this gas for something else.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.437
- What could that be?
- Launch grid online and active.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.954
Positions, ladies and gentlemen.
DEFCON 1 initiatives in progress.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.871
What? I told you not to launch!

16:39.960 --> 16:43.794
The gas is at 60 % density.
80 % and people start dying, Doctor.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.677
We've got no choice.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.438
Launching in 60,

16:48.560 --> 16:54.430
59, 58, 57, 56...

16:54.880 --> 17:00.159
Worldwide nuclear grid now coordinating
in 54, 53...

17:00.560 --> 17:04.712
Ha! The planet is going nuclear!
I admire them.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.156
The bravery of idiots
is bravery, nonetheless.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.795
The operative is in place, sir.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.917
Commander Skorr,
is the attack squad ready?

17:14.160 --> 17:16.913
Ready and eager for battle, sir.
We've been watching for long enough.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.148
It'll be good to taste blood.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.472
You're making a mistake, Colonel.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.436
For once, I hope the Sontarans are
ahead of you.

17:24.520 --> 17:29.196
North America, online.
United Kingdom, online.

17:29.280 --> 17:33.478
France, online. India, online,

17:33.560 --> 17:39.954
Pakistan, online. China, online.
North Korea, online.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.554
All systems locked and coordinated.

17:42.960 --> 17:48.671
Launching in 10, 9, 8, 7,

17:48.760 --> 17:50.352
6, 5...

17:50.440 --> 17:51.429
God save us.

17:51.520 --> 17:56.389
...4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.630
What is it? What happened?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.950
Did we launch? Well, did we?

18:10.040 --> 18:11.553
Negative, sir.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.275
The launch codes have been wiped, sir.
It must be the Sontarans.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.112
Can we override it?

18:16.400 --> 18:18.960
- Trying it now, sir.
- Missiles wouldn't even dent that ship,

18:19.040 --> 18:21.838
so why are the Sontarans
so keen to stop you?

18:21.920 --> 18:23.273
Any ideas?

18:23.760 --> 18:25.478
How should I know?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.670
Now, protect the operative.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.272
Stinking out there.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.871
Shh! Keep it down, lads.

18:55.280 --> 18:56.713
Enemy within! At arms!

18:56.800 --> 18:59.109
Greyhound 40 declaring
absolute emergency.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.749
Sontarans within factory grounds.
East corridor, grid 6.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.396
Absolute emergency. Declaring Code Red.
All troops, Code Red.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.357
Get them out of there.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.517
All troops, open fire.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.109
The guns aren't working.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.351
Inform all troops,
standard weapons do not work.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.400
Tell the Doctor
it's that Cordolaine signal.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.755
<i>He's the only one who can stop them.</i>

19:38.440 --> 19:40.556
Greyhound 40, report. Over.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.871
<i>Greyhound 40, report.</i>

19:46.360 --> 19:48.191
Greyhound 40, report.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.113
He wasn't Greyhound 40.
His name was Ross.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.436
Now listen to me,
and get them out of there!

20:01.080 --> 20:03.878
Trap One, to all stations. Retreat.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.198
Order imperative. Immediate retreat.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.552
Retreat! Retreat!

20:21.880 --> 20:23.871
Reporting for duty, sir.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.274
This is too easy.

20:30.360 --> 20:33.079
They're running like slimebait
from a speelfox.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.995
This isn't war! This is sport!

20:56.760 --> 20:58.352
They've taken the factory.

20:58.440 --> 21:02.035
Why? They don't need it.
Why attack now? What are they up to?

21:02.120 --> 21:04.509
At times like this,
I could do with the Brigadier.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.589
No offence.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.558
None taken. Sir Alistair's a fine man,
if not the best.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.074
Unfortunately, he's stranded in Peru.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.151
Launch grid back online.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.952
They're inside the system, sir.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.190
It's coming from within UNIT itself.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.714
Trace it. Find out where
it's coming from, and quickly.

21:25.800 --> 21:26.789
Gas levels?

21:26.880 --> 21:30.509
66 % in major population areas,
and rising.

21:31.560 --> 21:35.269
<i>Commander Skorr reports victory,
with many glorious deaths.</i>

21:36.960 --> 21:39.872
Sorry to report, sir, I've failed.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.274
They wouldn't come.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.636
The students, they didn't have
the imagination to believe.

21:46.720 --> 21:47.914
A pity.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.555
We've lost our target practice.

21:52.720 --> 21:53.755
What do you mean?

21:53.840 --> 21:58.197
Upon arrival on board this ship,
your students would have been shot down.

21:58.440 --> 22:01.477
Perhaps they were more clever
than you thought.

22:03.360 --> 22:06.079
- You promised.
- There was no planetfall.

22:06.560 --> 22:09.233
Castor 36, indeed!

22:09.320 --> 22:12.756
We only needed you for installation
of the Atmos system.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.910
No, but I'm on your side.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.595
I did everything you wanted.

22:19.320 --> 22:22.312
And it's not "Atmos system".
That's a tautology. It's just "Atmos".

22:22.400 --> 22:23.833
Execute him!

22:25.880 --> 22:27.632
A coward's retreat.

22:28.240 --> 22:31.277
Now close all teleport links to Earth.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.713
Isolate them as they perish!

22:48.920 --> 22:51.639
Why are they defending the factory
only after we're inside?

22:51.720 --> 22:53.995
Because they wanted UNIT here.

22:54.480 --> 22:58.519
You gave them something they needed,
something now hidden inside the factory,

22:58.600 --> 22:59.589
something precious.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.238
Then we've got to recover it.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.151
This Cordolaine signal thing,
how does it work?

23:03.240 --> 23:05.071
It's the bullets.
It causes expansion of the copper shell.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.388
Understood. I'm on it.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.995
For the billionth time,
you can't fight Sontarans!

23:13.800 --> 23:14.789
A phone. Have you got a phone?

23:16.320 --> 23:17.958
I need your mobile, quickly, hurry up.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.758
What's happened? Where are you?

23:28.840 --> 23:30.956
Still on Earth, but don't worry,
I've got my secret weapon.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.109
- And what's that?
- You.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.998
Hmm, somehow that's not making me happy.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.715
Can't you just zap us down to Earth
with that remote thing?

23:37.800 --> 23:39.392
Yeah, I haven't got a remote, though.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.391
I really should,
but I need you on that ship.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.913
That's why I made them move the Tardis.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.230
I'm sorry, but you've got to go outside.

23:45.320 --> 23:46.639
But there's Sonterruns out there.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.631
Sontarans. But they'll be
on battle stations right now.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.597
They don't exactly walk about
having coffee.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.716
<i>I can talk you through it.</i>

23:52.800 --> 23:54.518
But what if they find me?

23:54.600 --> 23:57.114
I know, and I wouldn't ask,
but there's nothing else I can do.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.714
The whole planet is choking, Donna.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.079
What do you need me to do?

24:04.160 --> 24:06.116
<i>The Sontarans are inside the factory,
which means they've got</i>

24:06.200 --> 24:08.077
<i>a teleport link with the ship,
and they'll have deadlocked it.</i>

24:08.160 --> 24:09.479
I need you to reopen the link.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.675
I can't even mend a fuse.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.751
Donna, stop talking about yourself
like that.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.956
You can do this, I promise.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.669
There's a Sonterrun. A Sontaran.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.113
Did he see you?

24:30.200 --> 24:31.235
No, he's got his back to me.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.151
Right, Donna, listen.
On the back of his neck, on his collar,

24:33.240 --> 24:35.470
there's a sort of plug, like a hole,
the Probic Vent.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.755
<i>One blow to the Probic Vent
knocks them out.</i>

24:37.840 --> 24:39.114
But he's going to kill me.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.715
I'm sorry. I swear, I'm so sorry,
but you've got to try.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.918
Back of the neck.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.593
Now then, you've got to find the
external junction feed to the teleport.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.477
What does it look like?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.790
Uh, circular panel on the wall,
big symbol on the front,

25:21.880 --> 25:24.189
like a letter "T" with
a horizontal line through it.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.316
<i>Or two "F"s back to back.</i>

25:26.680 --> 25:28.477
Oh, well, there's a door.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.549
Should be a switch by the side.

25:29.640 --> 25:30.789
Yeah, there is.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.440
But it's Sontaran-shaped,
you need three fingers.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.589
You've got three fingers.

25:34.680 --> 25:35.999
Oh, yeah.

25:44.320 --> 25:45.639
<i>I'm through.</i>

25:45.720 --> 25:48.029
Oh, you are brilliant, you are.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.674
Shut up.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.197
Right, "T" with a line through it.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.830
Gotta go. Keep the line open.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.078
I said, you don't stand a chance!

26:00.160 --> 26:02.469
Positions. That means everyone.

26:06.800 --> 26:07.915
You're not going without me.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.831
Wouldn't dream of it.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.750
Latest firing stock.
What do you think, Doctor?

26:36.840 --> 26:38.068
Are you my mummy?

26:38.160 --> 26:40.230
If you could concentrate...

26:40.320 --> 26:43.357
Bullets with a rad-steel coating,
no copper surface,

26:43.440 --> 26:45.351
should overcome the Cordolaine signal.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.158
But the Sontarans have got lasers.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.834
You can't even see in this fog.
The night-vision doesn't work.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.229
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you for your lack of faith.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.675
But this time I'm not listening.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.237
Attention, all troops.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.914
Sontarans might think of us
as primitive,

27:01.000 --> 27:04.310
as does every passing species
with an axe to grind.

27:04.520 --> 27:08.195
They make a mockery of our weapons,
our soldiers, our ideals.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.679
But no more.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.990
From this point on, it stops.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.357
From this point on,
the people of Earth fight back.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.589
And we show them.

27:16.680 --> 27:20.036
We show the warriors of Sontar
what the human race can do.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.588
Trap One to Hawk Major, go, go, go!

27:31.560 --> 27:34.028
It's working. The area's clearing.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.672
Engines to maximum!

27:38.880 --> 27:40.552
<i>It's the Valiant.</i>

27:46.000 --> 27:49.390
<i>UNIT carrier ship Valiant
reporting for duty, Doctor,</i>

27:49.520 --> 27:52.717
with engines strong enough
to clear away the fog.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.115
That's brilliant!

28:07.200 --> 28:08.918
Getting a taste for it, Doctor?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.752
No, not at all. Not me.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.277
<i>Valiant, fire at will.</i>

28:37.440 --> 28:39.271
East and north secure. Doctor?

28:39.360 --> 28:41.476
Donna, hold on, I'm coming.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.508
Shouldn't we follow the Colonel?

28:43.600 --> 28:46.717
Ah, you and me, Martha Jones,
just like old times.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.870
Alien technology, this way!

28:55.080 --> 28:57.992
The honour of battle. The glory!

29:07.200 --> 29:09.156
No Sontarans down here.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.596
They can't resist a battle.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.119
Here we go.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.034
Oh, Martha, I'm so sorry.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.479
Still alive.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.194
- Am I supposed to be impressed?
- Wish you carried a gun now?

29:44.280 --> 29:45.508
Not at all.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.398
I've been stopping the nuclear launch
all this time.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.391
Doing exactly what I wanted.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.755
I needed to stop the missiles
just as much as the Sontarans.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.149
I'm not having Earth start an
interstellar war. You're a triple agent.

29:55.240 --> 29:58.038
- When did you know?
- About you? Oh, right from the start.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.314
Reduced iris contraction,

29:59.400 --> 30:01.072
slight thinning of the hair follicles
on the left temple,

30:01.160 --> 30:03.230
and frankly, you smell.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.151
You might as well have worn a T-shirt
saying "clone",

30:05.240 --> 30:08.118
although maybe not
in front of Captain Jack.

30:09.080 --> 30:13.073
You remember him, don't you?
'Cause you've got all her memories.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.994
That's why the Sontarans
had to protect her,

30:16.080 --> 30:18.071
to keep you inside UNIT.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.519
Martha Jones is keeping you alive.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.752
All right, all right, I'm here,
I'm here, I've got you, I've got you.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.354
There was this thing, Doctor,
this alien, with this head...

30:34.040 --> 30:35.473
Blimey, I'm busy.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.279
- Got it?
- Yes. Now hurry up.

30:38.520 --> 30:39.509
<i>Take off the covering.</i>

30:39.600 --> 30:42.353
All the blue switches inside,
flick them up, like a fuse box.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.749
And that should get
the teleport working.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.671
Oh, my God!

30:48.120 --> 30:49.155
That's me.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.837
You will face me, sir.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.953
Wonderful.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.629
Don't touch me.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.392
It's not my fault.

31:12.480 --> 31:15.995
The Sontarans created you,
but you had all my memories.

31:16.080 --> 31:20.710
You've got a brother, sister,
mother and father.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.759
If you don't help me,
they're going to die.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.597
- You love them?
- Yes.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.279
Remember that?

31:28.360 --> 31:30.032
The gas! Tell us about the gas!

31:30.120 --> 31:31.348
He's the enemy!

31:31.440 --> 31:34.318
Then tell me.
It's not just poison. What's it for?

31:34.400 --> 31:35.958
Martha, please!

31:40.120 --> 31:42.156
Caesofine concentrate.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.515
It's one part Bosteen,
two parts Probic 5.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.909
Clonefeed! It's clonefeed!

31:49.080 --> 31:50.069
What's clonefeed?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.833
Like amniotic fluid for Sontarans.
That's why they're not invading.

31:52.920 --> 31:56.390
They're converting the atmosphere,
changing the planet into a clone world.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.789
Earth becomes a very big hatchery
'cause the Sontarans are clones.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.518
That's how they reproduce.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.956
Give them a planet this big,
they'll create billions of new soldiers.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.395
The gas isn't poison, it's food!

32:08.160 --> 32:11.232
My heart, it's getting slower.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.191
There's nothing I can do.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.510
In your mind, you've got so many plans.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.477
There's so much that you want to do.

32:18.560 --> 32:19.788
And I will.

32:19.880 --> 32:22.189
Never do tomorrow what you can do today,
my mum says.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.078
'Cause you never know
how long you've got.

32:27.240 --> 32:30.835
Martha Jones, all that life.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.799
Doctor!

33:06.640 --> 33:08.437
Blue switches done.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.878
But they've found me.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.429
Now!

33:19.480 --> 33:21.755
Have I ever told you
how much I hate you?

33:21.840 --> 33:23.558
Hold on! Hold on!
Get off me! Get off me!

33:23.640 --> 33:25.358
Got to bring the Tardis down.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.472
Right. Now, Martha, are you coming?

33:31.560 --> 33:33.596
What about this nuclear-launch thing?

33:33.680 --> 33:37.514
Keep pressing "N". Want to keep
those missiles on the ground.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.874
There's two of them.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.712
Yeah. Long story.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.949
Here we go! The old team back together!
Well, the new team.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.275
We're not going back on that ship!

33:49.360 --> 33:53.717
No, no, no, I need to get the teleport
working so that we can get to...

33:55.000 --> 33:57.912
Here. The Rattigan Academy, owned by...

33:58.000 --> 33:59.956
Don't tell anyone what I did.
It wasn't my fault.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.234
The Sontarans lied to me. They...

34:01.320 --> 34:03.311
If I see one more gun...

34:08.400 --> 34:11.551
You know, that coat sort of works.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.757
I feel like a kid in my dad's clothes.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.308
Oh, well, if you're calling him Dad,
you're definitely getting over him.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.911
The human female on board ship.
It could only be the Doctor's work,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.911
and all the teleport systems
have been deadlocked open.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.913
No matter.
Increase the Atmos devices to maximum.

34:28.159 --> 34:29.513
Choke them.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.956
Behold, the clone world is born.

34:51.320 --> 34:54.471
Ah, my little girl.
Come on, we'll be all right.

34:55.639 --> 34:58.791
We'll be all right. Donna said so.
She promised.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.633
Come on, darling. It's all right.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.597
That's why the Sontarans wanted
to stop the missiles.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.636
They were holding back.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.273
Because the caesofine gas is volatile,

35:09.360 --> 35:11.396
that's why they had to use you
to stop the nuclear attack.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.277
Ground-to-air engagement
could've sparked off the whole thing.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.679
What, like set fire to the atmosphere?

35:14.760 --> 35:17.433
Yeah, they need all the gas intact
to breed their clone army.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.875
And all the time, we had Luke here,
in his dream factory.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.188
Planning a little trip, were we?

35:21.280 --> 35:22.474
They promised me a new world.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.711
And you were building equipment,
ready to terraform El Mondo Luko,

35:25.800 --> 35:29.475
so that humans could live there
and breathe the air with this.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.116
An atmospheric converter.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.195
Prepare to launch clone pods.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.592
We will breed across
the surface of the Earth

35:40.720 --> 35:42.597
for the glory of Sontar!

35:54.040 --> 35:55.473
That's London.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.357
You can't even see it.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.473
My family's in there.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.959
If I can get this on
the right setting...

36:02.040 --> 36:04.235
Doctor, hold on.
You said the atmosphere would ignite.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.197
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

36:21.560 --> 36:24.597
Please, please, please, please,
please, please.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.991
General Staal, sir...

36:42.240 --> 36:43.912
What's happening?

37:45.040 --> 37:46.519
He's a genius.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.713
Just brilliant.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.631
Now we're in trouble.

37:51.920 --> 37:56.152
It seems we must revert to basic
Sontaran stratagem 1.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.196
We will ravage this planet.

37:58.280 --> 38:03.035
Prepare weapons, wipe them out!
Every last stinking human beast!

38:05.480 --> 38:08.677
Right. So, Donna,
thank you for everything.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.476
Martha, you, too. Oh...

38:14.640 --> 38:16.153
So many times.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.600
Luke, do something clever
with your life.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.519
You're saying goodbye.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.830
Sontarans are never defeated.

38:26.920 --> 38:28.911
They'll be getting ready for war.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.073
And well, you know, I've recalibrated
this for Sontaran air, so...

38:34.720 --> 38:36.915
You're going to ignite them?

38:39.480 --> 38:41.198
You'll kill yourself.

38:41.280 --> 38:45.558
Just send that thing up on its own.
I don't know. Put it on a delay.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.354
I can't.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.354
Why not?

38:53.600 --> 38:55.909
I've got to give them a choice.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.113
Oh, excellent!

39:23.120 --> 39:25.315
General Staal, you know what this is.

39:25.400 --> 39:29.234
But there's one more option.
You can go. Just leave.

39:29.880 --> 39:32.110
Sontaran High Command need never know
what happened here.

39:32.200 --> 39:36.239
Your stratagem would be wise
if Sontarans feared death,

39:36.320 --> 39:37.719
but we do not.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.074
At arms!

39:43.880 --> 39:46.030
I'll do it, Staal.
If it saves the Earth, I'll do it.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.111
A warrior doesn't talk. He acts.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.872
I am giving you the chance to leave.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.996
And miss the glory of this moment?

39:52.080 --> 39:54.640
<i>All weapons targeting Earth, sir.
Firing in 20.</i>

39:54.720 --> 39:56.631
- I'm warning you!
- And I salute you!

39:56.720 --> 39:57.994
Take aim!

39:58.080 --> 40:00.548
Shoot me, I'm still going to press this.
You'll die, Staal.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.153
Knowing that you died, too.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.229
<i>Firing in 15.</i>

40:03.320 --> 40:04.992
For the glory of Sontar!

40:05.080 --> 40:11.997
Sontar-ha!

40:15.080 --> 40:17.435
Sontar-ha!

40:17.520 --> 40:19.476
I'll do it! I'll do it!

40:21.720 --> 40:24.188
- What are you doing?
- Something clever.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.515
Sontar-ha!

40:26.600 --> 40:32.755
<i>...nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
three, two...</i>

40:32.840 --> 40:34.398
Sontar-ha!

40:34.480 --> 40:35.708
<i>...one.</i>

41:17.040 --> 41:18.758
- Morning.
- Morning.

41:18.840 --> 41:22.230
Walked all the way.
Won't catch me driving.

41:25.720 --> 41:29.474
The streets are half empty.
People still aren't driving.

41:29.600 --> 41:33.388
There's kids on bikes
all over the place. It's wonderful.

41:33.480 --> 41:37.189
Unpack that, love.
I'm going to see if Suzette's all right.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.668
I won't tell her. Best not.

41:46.840 --> 41:49.912
Just keep it as our little secret, eh?

41:50.000 --> 41:51.149
Yeah.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.312
And you go with him,
that wonderful Doctor.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.636
You go and see the stars.

42:02.840 --> 42:06.310
And then bring a bit of them back
for your old gramps.

42:23.280 --> 42:24.599
Love you.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.433
How were they?

42:38.560 --> 42:39.709
Oh...

42:41.320 --> 42:42.878
Same old stuff.

42:44.880 --> 42:45.995
They're fine.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.230
So, you gonna come with us?

42:48.320 --> 42:50.629
We're not exactly short of space.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.632
Oh, I have missed all this,
but, you know...

42:54.520 --> 42:57.273
I'm good here, back at home.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.800
And I'm better for having been away.

43:00.880 --> 43:03.189
Besides, someone needs me.

43:03.280 --> 43:06.431
Never mind the universe, I've got
a great big world of my own now.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.319
What? What?

43:14.920 --> 43:16.478
Doctor, don't you dare!

43:16.560 --> 43:18.915
No, no, I didn't touch anything!

43:19.000 --> 43:21.230
We're in flight! It's not me!

43:22.000 --> 43:23.399
Where are we going?

43:23.480 --> 43:25.755
I don't know. It's out of control!

43:29.480 --> 43:31.277
Doctor, just listen to me!

43:31.360 --> 43:34.158
You take me home!
Take me home right now!

43:46.120 --> 43:47.997
Where did she come from?

43:48.080 --> 43:49.354
From me.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.159
From you?

43:51.560 --> 43:52.675
How?

43:55.200 --> 43:56.428
Well...

43:58.000 --> 44:00.150
I'd like to see you try that.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.558
She's my daughter.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.439
Hello, Dad.
