WEBVTT

03:12.985 --> 03:14.771
First time in India, Miss Quested?

03:15.612 --> 03:17.273
First time out of England.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.030
I envy you. New horizons.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.449
Those are the Marabar Caves...

03:26.623 --> 03:28.614
...about 20 miles from you
at Chandrapore.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.162
I see.

03:31.336 --> 03:35.125
Mrs. Moore returns on the Rawalpindi
on May the 12th...

03:35.299 --> 03:37.961
...and your return is open.
That is correct?

03:39.303 --> 03:41.715
I'll be staying on, probably.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.803
If you decide to return with Mrs. Moore,
then let us know as soon as possible.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.887
I will.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.804
Now, labels, stickers, your ticket...

03:51.982 --> 03:54.064
...Mrs. Moore's ticket.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.815
You should have
an interesting voyage.

03:58.989 --> 04:02.482
The viceroy's on board.
Tends to liven things up.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.095
I do think it's too bad of Ronny
not to be here to meet us.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.930
Well, it is nearly a thousand miles.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.436
Oh, but we've come 5000 miles
to meet him.

06:03.155 --> 06:06.113
"No more than two annas each."

06:07.242 --> 06:08.653
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.869
Now, Victoria Station.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.212
Oh, dear.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.797
Don't worry.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.303
Mrs. Moore?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.305
Yes?

06:32.476 --> 06:36.686
I'm Mrs. Turton.
My husband's the collector.

06:36.855 --> 06:40.473
Oh, we gave our tickets
to the Indian gentleman.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.688
The chief administrator
of Chandrapore.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.648
Ronny's but a sahib.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.859
You must be Adela.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.694
Yes.

06:49.868 --> 06:53.202
Please forgive us, Mrs. Turton.
We've had a very trying day.

06:53.371 --> 06:57.114
We just wanted to welcome you
to the fold and to say-- We're off.

06:57.292 --> 07:00.159
We must have a drink or something
later when you've recovered.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.873
Goodbye.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.973
I believe you and Ronny met
in the Lake District, Miss Quested.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.857
Yes, we did.

07:24.027 --> 07:27.361
You must forgive me. We have
very few secrets in Chandrapore...

07:27.531 --> 07:29.898
...and I'm an incurable romantic.

07:33.537 --> 07:37.451
Miss Quested was with her aunt,
and I was with Ronny.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.250
You know, Mrs. Moore,
Ronny is doing splendidly.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.035
You'll be proud of him.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.250
I'll second that.
He's become a proper sahib.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.296
Just the type we want,
if I might say so.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.657
You know, Mr. Turton,
when we get settled in...

08:13.827 --> 08:16.239
...we look forward to meeting
some of the Indians...

08:16.413 --> 08:18.620
...you've come across socially
as friends.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.868
Well, as a matter of fact,
we don't come across them socially.

08:24.045 --> 08:28.084
They're full of all the virtues,
no doubt, but we don't.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.083
East is East, Mrs. Moore.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.424
It's a question of culture.

08:45.734 --> 08:49.272
Could Ronny
really have become a sahib?

08:50.697 --> 08:52.654
He could.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.941
But that's why you've come here.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.736
You'll find out soon enough.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.407
She's a dreadful woman.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.292
Yes.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.456
We'd better go to sleep, my dear.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.409
Hello, Mother.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.411
Where's Adela?

10:23.581 --> 10:24.912
Here.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.708
I can't believe it.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.500
Anthony.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.176
Anthony will see to the baggage.

10:42.350 --> 10:46.469
Forgive me, but I'm part
of the reception committee.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.937
Mr. Turton, it's a pleasure
to have you back in Asia.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.860
- Welcome back.
- Thank you very much.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.576
- How's it going?
- It's great to see you.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.738
- Thanks.
- Absolutely.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.622
Nice to have you back.

11:27.145 --> 11:30.012
Sorry to desert you, but we had
to welcome the great man back.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.727
I had no idea he was so important.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.357
You hadn't?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.629
Look out. Look out!

12:12.941 --> 12:16.024
- That was Turton.
- Turton?

12:20.490 --> 12:21.980
McBryde.

12:22.158 --> 12:26.026
When he first came out, Hamidullah
said he was quite a good fellow.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.916
But they all become
exactly the same.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.453
I give any Englishman two years.

12:35.630 --> 12:38.167
The women are worse.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.173
I give them six months.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.754
Ronny, is that a body?

13:23.928 --> 13:27.091
Yes. I'm sorry.
We'll soon be out of this.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.735
Why do we spend so much time
discussing the English?

13:49.913 --> 13:52.075
Because we admire them,
doctor sahib.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.659
That is the trouble.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.502
Tomorrow night.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.520
English.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.339
Here we are, then.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.891
Very nice, dear.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.687
Are those the Marabar Hills?

15:02.860 --> 15:04.521
That's right.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.858
- With the caves?
- I suppose so.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.114
Look, you've got
a very busy day tomorrow.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.902
Then we have a show at the club.
Come on. Let's have tea.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.661
Yes.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.829
Good night, Mother.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.585
Yes?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.500
Good night, dear.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.260
Good night.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.416
Having listened very carefully
to the evidence, I find you guilty...

16:08.593 --> 16:11.676
...of cheating under Section 415
of the Indian penal code...

16:11.846 --> 16:15.384
...and sentence you
to two months' hard labor.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.425
You may take the prisoner down.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.856
Well, how did it all go?

16:29.030 --> 16:30.737
We must have seen everything.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.569
Yes. The church, the hospital...

16:33.743 --> 16:35.905
...the war memorial, the barracks.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.820
Mr. Hadley was most thorough.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.489
Splendid. And now
you're off to the club.

16:53.763 --> 16:54.844
Cucumber.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.882
My dear...

16:59.060 --> 17:03.019
...life rarely gives us what we want at
the moment we consider appropriate.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.439
Adventures do occur...

17:06.608 --> 17:08.270
...but not punctually.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.458
Doctor sahib, when are we
going to get you married?

17:32.635 --> 17:35.297
I have enough responsibilities,
aunfle.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.633
We ask the poor fellow to dinner.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.471
We avail ourselves of his professional
skills, and you always bring up--

17:41.644 --> 17:45.308
It is the least I can do.
This should put a stop to the trouble.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.438
And, begum sahibah...

17:47.608 --> 17:50.646
...I beg you once more
not to drink water out of a tap.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.484
Please to boil it. Boil it, boil it.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.648
And now we can eat. Selim?

18:01.372 --> 18:04.831
Why must you always bring up
this question of marriage?

18:05.001 --> 18:07.083
He sends the children
nearly all his salary...

18:07.253 --> 18:10.496
...and lives like a low-grade clerk.
What more do you require of him?

18:15.803 --> 18:20.013
This chitlhljust arrived for you
from Major Callendar.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.688
I have to report
to his bungalow posthaste.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.027
And my bicycle has a puncture.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.704
The major sahib
left half an hour ago.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.618
And left no message?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.537
No message.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.672
Mrs. Leslie, it is a tonga.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.554
- Come.
- Splendid.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.393
Oh, I suppose this is all right.

19:07.563 --> 19:11.431
My dear, never look a gift horse in
the mouth, particularly in this country.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.312
The club.

19:14.237 --> 19:17.400
Club, tonga wallah. Club.
Why doesn't the fool move?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.235
I pay you tomorrow.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.080
Will you please--?

21:25.868 --> 21:29.782
Madam, this is a mosque.
You have no right here.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.663
You should have
taken off your shoes.

21:31.832 --> 21:35.951
But I have taken off my shoes.
I left them outside.

21:38.631 --> 21:42.465
Then I ask your pardon.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.255
- Let me go.
- Madam.

21:52.895 --> 21:55.307
I am right, am I not?

21:55.481 --> 21:57.768
If I remove my shoes, I am allowed?

21:57.942 --> 22:00.934
Of course, but so few ladies
take the trouble...

22:01.112 --> 22:03.319
...especially if thinking
no one is here to see.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.314
God is here.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.568
God is here.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.663
That is very fine.
May I know your name?

22:14.834 --> 22:17.041
Mrs. Moore.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.626
I came from the club.

22:28.597 --> 22:32.841
They're doing a rather tiresome
musical play I'd seen in London.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.180
It was very hot.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.095
I think you ought not to walk alone,
Mrs. Moore.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.809
There are bad characters about...

22:38.983 --> 22:41.941
...and leopards may come
from the Marabar Hills. Snakes also.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.647
You walk alone.

22:44.447 --> 22:47.280
I come here quite often.
I'm used to it.

22:47.450 --> 22:48.861
Used to snakes?

22:49.035 --> 22:53.324
I am a doctor, you see.
Snakes don't dare bite me.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.451
Please.

22:59.128 --> 23:03.622
Mrs. Moore, I think
you are newly arrived in India.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.131
Yes. How did you know?

23:06.302 --> 23:08.464
By the way you address me.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.173
Look.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.432
Sometimes I have seen
a dead body float past...

23:18.606 --> 23:20.438
...from Benares...

23:20.608 --> 23:22.645
...but not very often.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.150
- There are crocodiles.
- Crocodiles?

23:25.321 --> 23:27.312
How terrible.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.490
What a terrible river.

23:32.953 --> 23:35.490
What a wonderful river.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.085
Please, may I ask you
a question now?

23:39.251 --> 23:40.912
Why do you come to India?

23:41.087 --> 23:44.296
I come to visit my son.
He's the city magistrate.

23:44.465 --> 23:48.003
Oh, no, excuse me.
Our city magistrate is Mr. Heaslop.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.418
He is my son, all the same.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.803
I was married twice.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.010
And your first husband died?

23:55.184 --> 23:58.267
He did. And so did my second.

23:59.355 --> 24:02.188
Then we are in the same box.

24:02.358 --> 24:05.441
And is the city magistrate
the entire of your family now?

24:05.611 --> 24:10.856
No. I have a daughter in England
by my second husband.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.570
Stella. She is an artist.

24:15.955 --> 24:20.665
Mrs. Moore, like yourself,
I have also a son and a daughter.

24:20.835 --> 24:23.247
Is not this the same box
with a vengeance?

24:23.420 --> 24:26.037
But not called
Ronny and Stella, surely.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.296
No, indeed.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.504
Akbar and Jamila.
They live with my wife's mother.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.510
And your wife?

24:33.514 --> 24:35.425
In giving me a son, she died.

24:39.353 --> 24:42.061
You have the most kind face...

24:42.231 --> 24:44.222
...of any English lady I have met.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.733
I think I'd better go back now.

25:03.085 --> 25:06.749
And...now.

25:22.438 --> 25:25.146
I wish I were a member.
I could have asked you in.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.434
Indians are not allowed.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.780
Good night.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.918
There you are.
What have you been up to?

25:55.095 --> 25:57.257
I'll tell you about it later.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.342
I had a small adventure...

25:59.516 --> 26:02.975
...and saw the moon in the Ganges.

26:12.613 --> 26:15.105
Mrs. Moore, Miss Quested,
have a drink.

26:15.282 --> 26:18.024
- Have two drinks.
- That's very kind.

26:18.202 --> 26:21.786
My wife's on-stage, and Ronny's still
holding the fort for Major Callendar...

26:21.956 --> 26:23.367
...who's off with an appendix.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.282
His wretched Indian assistant
didn't turn up in time.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.417
I got my own back.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.669
I'm sorry about the show.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.705
But what else can we do
for you ladies?

26:33.384 --> 26:37.844
Mr. Turton, I'm longing to see
something of the real India.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.633
Fielding. How's one to see
the real India?

26:42.810 --> 26:45.097
Try seeing Indians.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.762
- Who was that?
- Our schoolmaster.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.101
Government College.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.312
As if one could avoid seeing them.

26:51.485 --> 26:54.352
Well, I've scarcely spoken
to an Indian since we landed.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.020
Lucky you.

26:56.865 --> 27:00.324
I tell you what, if you really want
to meet some of our Aryan brothers...

27:00.494 --> 27:02.235
...how about a bridge party?

27:03.205 --> 27:05.617
- Not the game.
- No.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.579
A party to bridge the gulf
between East and West.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.868
We can produce
almost any type you like:

27:11.046 --> 27:14.914
Hindus, Muslims,
Sikhs, even a Parsee.

28:25.287 --> 28:28.405
And you?
You've never been up for English tea.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.747
To work, Molly. To work.

28:34.797 --> 28:38.006
I never thought so many would turn up.
They hate it as much as we do.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.758
Oh, good afternoon.
Very nice of you to come.

29:24.012 --> 29:27.380
Would you please tell these ladies
I wish we could speak their language?

29:27.558 --> 29:29.549
Perhaps we speak yours a little.

29:29.726 --> 29:32.764
Why, fancy, she understands.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.267
Piccadilly. Hyde Park Corner.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.024
Yes, indeed.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.604
Thornton Road.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.155
Marble Arch.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.028
She knows Paris also.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.236
They passed Paris on the way,
no doubt.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.174
My only consolation...

30:00.340 --> 30:02.422
...is that Mrs. Turton...

30:02.593 --> 30:06.427
...will soon be retired to a villa
in Tunbridge Wells.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.851
Who is that man talking to Adela?

30:18.817 --> 30:21.775
Oh, that's Fielding.
Runs Government College.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.902
I don't understand
people inviting guests...

30:27.075 --> 30:29.407
...and not treating them properly.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.278
You and Mr. Turton
are the only people...

30:32.456 --> 30:35.289
...who've made any attempt
to be friendly.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.700
It makes me quite ashamed.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.415
It's awkward, I agree,
here at the club.

30:40.589 --> 30:43.297
I envy you being with Indians.

30:43.467 --> 30:44.502
I tell you what.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.759
If you and Mrs. Moore would care
to meet one, it's easily arranged.

30:47.930 --> 30:51.139
I'd love to. I'm sure she would too.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.640
We've an old Hindu professor
down at the college...

30:53.810 --> 30:56.768
...who'll tell you all about reincarnation
and destiny.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.521
He might even be persuaded
to sing.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.647
I'd like that.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.808
Tell me, do you know a Dr. Aziz?

31:02.986 --> 31:05.318
I know of him.
I've never actually met.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.730
Mrs. Moore says he's charming.

31:07.908 --> 31:10.366
- Good. We'll invite him too.
- Good.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.364
Oh, dear.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.624
This is for Mrs. Turton.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.128
This is one of the most
unnatural affairs...

31:27.302 --> 31:28.963
...I have ever attended.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.629
Of course it's unnatural.
Now you see.

31:31.807 --> 31:36.096
I do not see why you all behave
so unpleasantly to these people.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.261
We're not out hereto be pleasant.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.567
Ronny, what do you mean?

31:43.402 --> 31:45.518
India isn't a drawing room.

31:45.696 --> 31:48.734
We're out hereto do justice
and to keep the peace.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.365
I'm not a missionary
or a sentimental socialist.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.867
I'm just a member
of the civil service.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.493
As simple as that?

31:55.664 --> 31:57.996
What do you and Adela
want me to do?

31:58.166 --> 31:59.748
Sacrifice my career?

31:59.918 --> 32:02.831
Lose the power I have for doing good
in this benighted country?

32:03.005 --> 32:04.791
Good?

32:04.965 --> 32:06.672
You're speaking about power.

32:06.842 --> 32:10.380
The whole of this entertainment
is an exercise in power...

32:10.554 --> 32:14.263
...and the subtle pleasures
of personal superiority.

32:23.984 --> 32:28.774
God has put us on earth
to love and help our fellow men.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.689
Yes, Mother.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.586
Mr. Fielding?

33:15.911 --> 33:18.403
- Mr. Fielding?
- Oh, hello.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.911
Is that Dr. Aziz?

33:20.749 --> 33:23.582
Yes. I'm afraid I'm early.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.083
That's fine.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.245
I won't be a jiffy.
Please make yourself at home.

33:28.423 --> 33:31.165
May I really, Mr. Fielding?

33:31.343 --> 33:33.300
It's very good of you.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.365
- Mr. Fielding?
- Yes?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.951
Ihavelong
been wanting to meet you.

34:03.125 --> 34:06.117
I have heard many times
about your kind heart...

34:06.294 --> 34:07.955
...and your sociability.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.121
My dear fellow.

34:11.675 --> 34:14.632
And I have seen you in the bazaar.

34:47.793 --> 34:50.456
- I say, Mr. Fielding?
- Yes?

34:50.630 --> 34:53.588
Before you come out,
guess what I look like.

34:53.759 --> 34:57.844
Well, let's see.
You're about 5 foot, 9 inches tall.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.675
Jolly good.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.386
Well, I can see that much
through the glass.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.344
Blast it.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.730
Anything wrong?

35:09.900 --> 35:12.767
I've just broken my back-collar stud.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.059
Take mine.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.353
Have you a spare one?

35:16.531 --> 35:18.522
Yes. Yes, one minute.

35:18.700 --> 35:22.068
- Not if you're wearing it.
- No, no, here in my pocket.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.366
Nobody carries a spare stud
in his pocket.

35:25.540 --> 35:29.374
I always, in case of emergency.

35:30.712 --> 35:31.918
Here it is.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.209
Many thanks.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.670
- Oh, and how do you do?
- How do you do?

35:37.844 --> 35:40.802
Sit down while I finish,
if you don't mind unconventionality.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.883
No, not at all.

35:48.230 --> 35:51.723
I always thought Englishmen
kept their rooms so tidy.

35:51.900 --> 35:55.393
Everything arranged coldly on shelves
is what I thought.

35:59.241 --> 36:02.950
There are two English ladies
coming to tea to meet you.

36:03.119 --> 36:05.247
Oh, I think you know one of them.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.745
- I know no English ladies.
- Not Mrs. Moore?

36:09.292 --> 36:12.375
- Mrs. Moore?
- And Miss Quested, her companion.

36:12.546 --> 36:14.628
Oh, is she an old lady?

36:14.798 --> 36:17.460
She's a young lady,
and she wants to see India.

36:21.096 --> 36:24.009
They're here,
or will be in a few seconds.

36:27.936 --> 36:31.395
I've also asked our professor
of philosophy, Narayan Godbole.

36:31.565 --> 36:34.557
Oh, the inscrutable Brahman.

36:34.734 --> 36:38.147
I beg goodness his food will be
all right. He's orthodox, you know.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.783
How kind of you to ask us
to come here today.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.330
Must have been a small audience hall
in the old days.

36:54.504 --> 36:57.087
Mrs. Moore, do you remember
the tank in our mosque'?

36:57.257 --> 37:00.670
- Idoindeed.
- Please, come and see.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.551
By a skillful arrangement
of our emperors...

37:03.722 --> 37:06.384
...the same water
comes and fills this tank.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.515
My ancestors loved water.

37:08.685 --> 37:09.971
We came out of the desert...

37:10.145 --> 37:12.762
...over the Himalayas
from Persia and Afghanistan.

37:12.939 --> 37:16.523
And wherever we went, we created
fountains and gardens and--

37:18.820 --> 37:20.857
Godbole. You know Dr. Aziz.

37:21.031 --> 37:23.989
And here are our new visitors,
Mrs. Moore, Miss Quested.

37:24.159 --> 37:25.320
Professor Godbole.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.109
We didn't realize you were here.

37:27.287 --> 37:30.120
The sun will soon be driving us
all into the shade...

37:30.290 --> 37:32.657
...and I was enjoying the water.

37:34.377 --> 37:38.837
Now, Mrs. Moore, would you like
to have our tea served inside or out?

37:44.471 --> 37:49.341
Dr. Aziz, I wonder if you could explain
a disappointment we had this morning.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.680
Yes. I'm afraid
we may have given some offense.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.346
Oh, that is impossible.
May I know the facts?

37:55.523 --> 37:56.558
Yes.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.223
An Indian lady and gentleman...

37:58.401 --> 38:00.608
...who we met at the club party
the other day...

38:00.779 --> 38:03.862
...were to collect us in their carriage
this morning at 9.

38:04.032 --> 38:07.195
We waited and waited.
They never came.

38:07.369 --> 38:09.861
They even put off going to Delhi
to entertain us.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.905
- I wouldn't worry about it anyway.
- Well, it is very worrying.

38:13.083 --> 38:16.201
I think, perhaps, young lady,
they grow ashamed of their house...

38:16.378 --> 38:18.210
...and that is why they did not send.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.371
That's very possible.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.209
I do so hate mysteries.

38:22.384 --> 38:24.216
We English do.

38:24.386 --> 38:28.380
I rather like mysteries,
but I do dislike muddles.

38:28.556 --> 38:31.890
You know, I think of mystery as only
a high-sounding term for a muddle.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.518
The professor, Aziz and I
know that India's a muddle.

38:34.688 --> 38:36.725
Agreed, I'm sorry to say.

38:37.482 --> 38:40.349
There will be no muddle when
you come to visit me at my house.

38:40.527 --> 38:42.859
Oh, that would be very nice.
Yes, Adela?

38:43.029 --> 38:46.863
Yes, indeed. Do please
give me your address, Dr. Aziz.

38:48.702 --> 38:50.238
- Yes?
- One moment.

38:50.412 --> 38:51.868
I have a better idea.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.951
Let me invite you all to a picnic
at the Marabar Caves.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.958
Ladies, this will be
a most magnificent outing.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.085
One is transported
by mountain railway...

39:00.255 --> 39:02.121
...2000 feet above the plain.

39:02.298 --> 39:05.461
And the caves, Mrs. Moore,
are a wonder of India.

39:05.635 --> 39:06.921
Yes, professor?

39:07.095 --> 39:08.961
They have a reputation.

39:12.392 --> 39:15.259
Doctor, how many caves are there?

39:15.937 --> 39:17.723
I'm not exactly sure.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.434
Unfortunately,
I've never been there myself.

39:21.443 --> 39:22.933
My dear chap.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.194
Professor Godbole,
have you seen the caves?

39:27.073 --> 39:29.110
Oh, yes.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.284
Could you tell us something
about them?

39:34.622 --> 39:35.783
With pleasure.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.627
Only a few have been opened.

39:42.797 --> 39:45.129
Perhaps seven or eight.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.298
And?

39:48.762 --> 39:51.424
There is an entrance
which you enter.

39:51.598 --> 39:54.260
And through this entrance,
manmade...

39:54.434 --> 39:57.017
...there is a circular chamber.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.144
Big?

39:59.981 --> 40:01.346
Not big.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.310
Immensely holy, no doubt.

40:03.485 --> 40:06.227
- Oh, no, no.
- Ornamented in some way?

40:07.697 --> 40:09.404
They are all the same:

40:09.574 --> 40:12.236
Empty and dark.

40:18.458 --> 40:21.996
Well, there must be something
to account for their reputation.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.373
Indeed.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.057
Well, well.

40:34.224 --> 40:38.593
Mr. Fielding, I should like to see
something of the college.

40:38.770 --> 40:43.105
Don't you come, Adela.
I know you hate institutions.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.270
You know, Miss Quested...

40:50.448 --> 40:52.530
...when I first saw Mrs. Moore...

40:52.700 --> 40:55.158
...it was in the moonlight.

40:55.328 --> 40:57.615
I thought she was a ghost.

40:58.414 --> 41:01.156
- A very old soul.
- An old soul?

41:01.334 --> 41:04.452
Professor Godbole is using
the expression in its Hindu sense.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.166
Someone who has been here
many times before.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.001
Mrs. Moore, a reincarnation?

41:09.175 --> 41:10.791
Quite so.

41:12.053 --> 41:14.795
- Please go on, professor.
- Yes.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.510
It is philosophy
of some complication.

41:17.684 --> 41:18.970
But in simple terms?

41:19.144 --> 41:23.388
In simple terms, Miss Quested,
life is a wheel with many spokes.

41:23.565 --> 41:27.308
A continuous cycle of life, birth...

41:27.485 --> 41:29.567
...death and rebirth...

41:29.737 --> 41:32.946
...until we attain nirvana.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.613
I have contrived a dance
based on this philosophy.

41:36.786 --> 41:38.743
- Do you dance, professor?
- Oh, yes.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.290
Adela.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.163
Oh, Ronny, you're early.

41:42.333 --> 41:45.291
Let me introduce to you Professor
Godbole, and this-- And that--

41:45.461 --> 41:47.748
What happened to Fielding?
Where's my mother?

41:47.922 --> 41:49.583
And what on earth are you doing?

41:49.757 --> 41:52.590
They're seeing the college,
and we're eating water chestnuts.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.593
- Have one.
- No, thank you. We're leaving at once.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.798
- But we can't leave like this.
- It's perfectly all right.

42:00.602 --> 42:03.469
Bearer? Bearer!

42:21.706 --> 42:24.744
You can take it from me,
that picnic will never come off.

42:25.710 --> 42:29.078
Just like that fiasco this morning.
He'll forget he ever invited you.

42:29.255 --> 42:30.290
I think you're wrong.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.376
Notice the collar
climbing up his neck?

42:32.550 --> 42:35.463
I like Dr. AZiZ.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.141
Aziz was dressed in his Sunday best
from head to foot...

42:43.311 --> 42:45.473
...but he'd forgotten
his back-collar stud.

42:45.647 --> 42:47.479
And there you have the Indian
all over.

42:47.649 --> 42:50.516
I'll wager he's forgotten the caves
are miles from the station.

42:50.693 --> 42:53.185
- Have you been to them?
- I know about them, naturally.

42:53.363 --> 42:54.398
Naturally.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.280
I really cannot have
this quarreling and tiresomeness.

42:57.450 --> 42:58.485
Sorry.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.491
I don't know why I get so het up.

43:07.794 --> 43:10.286
Actually, I was taking us all
to see a game of polo.

43:10.463 --> 43:11.828
Should be good.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.873
Not for me, dear. I'm going to rest.

43:15.051 --> 43:17.839
You and Adela can watch the polo.

43:35.071 --> 43:37.859
- Ronny.
- Yes?

43:38.491 --> 43:41.700
- I want to say something.
- Yes?

43:42.120 --> 43:44.327
Something important.

43:51.546 --> 43:55.881
Ronny, I've finally decided
we're not going to be married.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.509
- You never said we would be married.
- No.

44:09.022 --> 44:11.639
But you were quite right to come out.
It was a good idea.

44:20.033 --> 44:22.900
We're being awfully English
about this, aren't we?

44:23.369 --> 44:24.951
I suppose that's all right.

44:26.205 --> 44:29.448
As we are English,
yes, I suppose it is.

44:38.301 --> 44:40.508
Let's go for a little drive.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.385
Oughtn't we get back
to the bungalow?

44:42.555 --> 44:43.761
Why?

44:44.432 --> 44:47.925
I think we should tell your mother,
talk about what we're going to do.

44:48.102 --> 44:50.264
If you don't mind,
let's leave it a day or two.

44:50.438 --> 44:52.600
I don't want to upset her
any more than I have.

44:52.774 --> 44:55.482
And besides,
you're going on that expedition.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.605
Yes.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.857
And why did you undertake
such an extravagance?

45:04.035 --> 45:05.992
To avoid asking them to my house.

45:06.162 --> 45:08.369
Which you had already done.

45:09.457 --> 45:12.791
Now we must all put our shoulders
to the wheel.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.373
My wife will supply plates,
knives and forks.

45:16.547 --> 45:19.130
And then there's the question
of alcohol.

45:19.300 --> 45:22.338
Whiskey sodas for Mr. Fielding,
ports for the ladies.

45:23.471 --> 45:26.805
And food.
The English are big eaters.

45:26.974 --> 45:29.887
- And Professor Godbole?
- He eats more than the English.

45:30.061 --> 45:32.302
And nothing but vegetables,
fruits and rice.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.062
And only if cooked by a Brahman.

45:34.232 --> 45:37.520
If there is a slice of beef
in the vicinity, he'll certainly throw up.

45:37.693 --> 45:40.230
The English can eat mutton.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.399
Even ham.

45:42.573 --> 45:46.111
Ham?
Are you suggesting I offer ham?

45:46.285 --> 45:47.662
Enough, enough.

45:48.788 --> 45:52.247
Now, English ladies cannot sit on the
ground, not even on a Persian carpet.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.829
You must take chairs and tables.

45:55.002 --> 45:56.413
So you will need servants.

45:56.587 --> 46:00.376
Then there is the question of transport
after the train journey.

46:00.550 --> 46:03.759
The caves are a considerable distance
from the station.

46:03.928 --> 46:07.512
I've just been to the station.
The train leaves before dawn.

46:07.682 --> 46:10.515
Then you must take precaution
against lack of punctuality.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.844
Better spend the night there.

46:21.404 --> 46:23.361
- What was that?
- Nothing.

46:23.531 --> 46:25.522
It always happens
before the hot weather.

46:25.700 --> 46:28.613
Generally with dust and thunder.
Coffee?

46:28.786 --> 46:30.777
No, thank you. I'm off to bed.

46:32.415 --> 46:35.373
Mother, I know I made myself
rather ridiculous this afternoon...

46:35.543 --> 46:38.706
...but the truth is I wasn't
quite sure of myself, and I'm sorry.

46:40.381 --> 46:43.419
Very nicely said. Thank you, dear.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.669
I have no earthly right
to tell either of you...

46:46.846 --> 46:48.507
...what you can or cannot do.

46:48.681 --> 46:51.514
See India if you like,
and as you like.

46:54.061 --> 46:57.725
Sometimes I think too much fuss
is made about marriage.

46:57.899 --> 47:02.234
Century after century
of carnal embracement...

47:02.403 --> 47:05.566
...and we're still no nearer
understanding one another.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.481
Good night.

53:06.392 --> 53:09.475
Adela, are you all right?

53:10.229 --> 53:12.095
Yes, of course.

53:14.358 --> 53:17.476
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing.

53:20.489 --> 53:23.481
I want to take back
what I said at the polo.

53:24.285 --> 53:28.074
Oh, Ronny, I'm such a fool.

53:48.475 --> 53:52.469
It's a funny thing.
I don't feel a bit excited.

53:53.063 --> 53:55.179
Well, nothing's really changed,
has it?

53:55.357 --> 53:57.644
I feel perfectly ordinary.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.647
It's much the best feeling to have.

54:03.324 --> 54:05.065
I suppose so.

54:08.829 --> 54:11.161
I'm sorry to have been so difficult.

54:11.332 --> 54:13.164
Oh, I shouldn't worry.

54:13.667 --> 54:16.659
It's partly to do with this country...

54:17.504 --> 54:20.997
...and the odd surroundings.

54:21.300 --> 54:26.841
Do you mean that my bothers
are to do with India?

54:27.681 --> 54:32.926
India forces one
to come face to face with oneself.

54:33.896 --> 54:36.479
It can be rather disturbing.

54:39.485 --> 54:41.067
Odd.

54:41.737 --> 54:45.196
It must be very cold in England.

54:50.996 --> 54:53.078
Now we must go back...

54:53.248 --> 54:55.626
...and you must dance with Ronny.

54:55.793 --> 54:59.707
Apart from anything else,
it will serve as a notice of intent.

55:05.386 --> 55:06.922
Hello.

56:56.497 --> 56:58.113
Hassan.

57:50.884 --> 57:52.420
It's going to be hot.

57:52.594 --> 57:55.086
Your famous hot weather.

57:55.264 --> 57:57.722
- Mother?
- You two go ahead.

58:07.067 --> 58:09.559
Congratulations.
We've just heard the good news.

58:09.736 --> 58:12.865
- Allow me to shake your hand.
- Thank you very much, sir.

58:44.313 --> 58:48.307
- Mr. Fielding. I'm Dr. Lal.
- Yes. How do you do?

58:48.483 --> 58:51.145
Just making check on doctor sahib.

58:51.570 --> 58:54.278
- Major Callendar's orders.
- And?

58:54.448 --> 58:57.281
A slight fever perhaps.
Change of season.

58:57.784 --> 58:59.366
You must get well quickly.

58:59.536 --> 59:03.154
Yes. There is talk
of cholera in the city.

59:03.332 --> 59:05.824
There is always talk of cholera
in the city.

59:06.001 --> 59:08.288
Hello. Can I come in?

59:08.795 --> 59:13.130
Mr. Fielding. Yes, please come in.

59:18.055 --> 59:21.548
- Hamidullah.
- Mr. Fielding, how nice of you to come.

59:24.645 --> 59:25.885
And how is the patient?

59:26.438 --> 59:29.726
It is very good of Mr. Fielding
to condescend to visit our friend.

59:29.900 --> 59:31.061
We're all deeply touched.

59:31.235 --> 59:33.943
Don't talk to him like that.
He does not want it.

59:35.280 --> 59:38.318
And he does not need three chairs.
He's not three Englishmen.

59:42.871 --> 59:44.828
Well, are you ill or aren't you?

59:45.916 --> 59:48.499
No doubt Major Callendar
told you I'm shamming.

59:48.669 --> 59:50.125
Well, are you?

59:52.172 --> 59:55.915
The hot weather is coming.
I have a fever.

59:57.135 --> 01:00:00.503
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down, all of you.

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:05.265
Mr. Fielding, excuse.
A question, please.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.721
Carry on.

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:08.056
Nothing personal.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:11.473
Personally, we are all delighted
that you should be here.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.233
But how is England justified
in holding India?

01:00:14.695 --> 01:00:17.687
- Unfair political question.
- No,no.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:20.193
Personally, I'm out here
because I need a job.

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.529
Qualified Indians also need a job.

01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:24.785
I got in first.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.248
And I'm delighted to be here.

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:31.625
That's my answer,
and that's my only excuse.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:33.752
And those
who are not delighted to be here?

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.378
Chuck them out.

01:00:37.426 --> 01:00:39.212
Indians are also saying that.

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:57.059
Mr. Fielding?

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:02.239
What are you doing out here?

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:04.366
Please come back.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.739
Of course.

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:18.088
Here you see
the celebrated hospitality of the East.

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:21.584
Look. Look at the mess.

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:24.257
Look at the flies.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.722
Look at the plaster
coming off the wall.

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:28.724
Oh, please.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:30.931
Here is my home...

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:33.729
...where you come
to be insulted by my friends.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.606
That was fair enough.

01:01:35.776 --> 01:01:38.143
And you'd better get back into bed.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.903
- And then you will have to be off.
- You should rest.

01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:43.565
I can rest all day, thanks to Dr. Lal.

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:45.779
Major Callendar's spy.

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:47.488
I suppose you know that.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:51.075
Major Callendar doesn't trust anyone,
English or Indian.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:52.831
That's his character.

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:57.290
I wish you weren't under him,
but you are and that's that.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.297
There we are.

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:02.628
Try sleeping for a bit.

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:04.419
- Before you go--
- Yes?

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:07.463
Will you please open that drawer
under the clock?

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.851
There's a gray cardboard folder.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:16.730
That's right. Open it.

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.647
She was my wife.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:34.247
You are the first Englishman
she has ever come before.

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:39.089
Now put her away.

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:42.999
I don't know why you pay me
this great compliment...

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:44.507
...but I do appreciate it.

01:02:45.137 --> 01:02:46.719
Oh, it is nothing.

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:51.007
She was not a highly
educated woman, or even beautiful...

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.175
...but I loved her.

01:02:53.562 --> 01:02:56.725
Now put her away.
You would have seen her anyhow.

01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:58.688
You would have allowed me
to see?

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:00.099
Why not?

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:03.736
I believe in the purdah, but I would
have told her you were my brother.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:07.155
- Would she have believed you?
- Of course not.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.528
Put her away. She's dead.

01:03:13.165 --> 01:03:16.374
I showed her to you
because I have nothing else to show.

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:25.544
Mr. Fielding.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.385
Why are you not married?

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:32.465
The lady I liked wouldn't marry me.
That's the main point.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:36.431
That was a long time ago,
before the war.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.439
- You haven't any children?
- None.

01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:44.102
Excuse the following question.
Have you any illegitimate children?

01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:45.735
No.

01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:49.065
- Then your name will die entirely out.
- Right.

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:54.445
This is what an Oriental
will never understand.

01:03:54.623 --> 01:03:57.581
There are far too many children
anyway.

01:03:58.627 --> 01:04:00.743
- Why don't you marry Miss Quested?
- Good Lord.

01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:02.628
But she's very nice.

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:04.583
I can't marry her even if I wanted to.

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:07.796
She has just become engaged
to the city magistrate.

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:13.131
So no Miss Quested
for Mr. Fielding.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:18.094
However, she's not beautiful
and she has practically no breasts.

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:20.182
For a magistrate
they may be sufficient...

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:23.691
...but for you I will arrange a lady
with breasts like Bombay mangoes.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.851
No, you won't.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.770
You must not tell Major Callendar...

01:04:27.948 --> 01:04:30.610
...but last year I took sick leave
and I went to Calcutta.

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:31.819
There are girls there--

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:34.906
I shall tell Major Callendar
you've made a remarkable recovery.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.320
I have.

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:38.364
Please tell your chap
to bring my horse.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:39.953
He doesn't understand my Urdu.

01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:42.288
I told him not to.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.169
But now I will release you.

01:04:45.966 --> 01:04:47.252
Hassan.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:54.053
By the way,
about this Marabar expedition--

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.760
It's gonna cost an awful lot.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:58.221
Would you like me to help you
call it off?

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.599
No, no.
Arrangements are almost complete.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.935
I shall know exact date tomorrow.

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:07.022
Well, good. Don't leave it too long.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.001
Hassan.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:56.032
You've come after all. I was afraid--
How kind. How very kind.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:06:00.366
I'm sorry, Dr. Aziz, but I've never been
at my best at this time of the morning.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:04.534
- We're here, anyway.
- Yes. Excuse me. Please come.

01:06:19.059 --> 01:06:20.299
This isn't all for us?

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:24.015
Oh, for this great occasion,
I've had help from all my friends.

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.226
I think you will not need
your servant.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:29.020
No, indeed.

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:31.561
And then we shall all be Muslims
together.

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:34.355
Anthony. I don't like him at all.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:35.567
Anthony.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.078
You can go now.
We won't need you anymore.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:39.905
Master told me to stay.

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:42.742
Mistress tells you to go.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:47.288
Master says,
"Keep near ladies all morning."

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:49.798
Please go.

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:10.766
What's that for'?

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:13.527
A surprise. You will see.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:16.314
Come, come, come. Please come.

01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:21.819
You are traveling purdah.
You will like that?

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:25.489
- It will certainly be a new experience.
- Yes.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.292
Where's Mr. Fielding?

01:07:29.587 --> 01:07:33.706
He'll be here.
Englishmen never miss trains.

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:55.068
Mr. Fielding. Mr. Fielding.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:57.320
I'm most awfully sorry, Aziz.

01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:02.326
Oh, Mr. Fielding.
You have destroyed me.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:05.487
It was Godbole's prayers.
They went on forever.

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:06.700
Jump on! Jump!

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.162
- No,no!
- I must have you.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.713
I'm sorry, Aziz,
but it really is no good.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.080
We'll join you.

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:16.999
Somehow.

01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:20.176
Mrs. Moore, our expedition is a ruin.

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:24.340
Nonsense.
We shall now all be Muslims together.

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:25.970
Dear, dear Mrs. Moore.

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:30.809
Go back to your carriage, Dr. Aziz.
You make me quite giddy.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:36.685
Poor Aziz.
We must try and get hold of a car.

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:38.729
Can you think of anyone?

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:41.698
Is anything the matter?

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:44.986
- You saw the gate shut against us?
- Yes.

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:47.700
Today is Tuesday.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:48.863
Go on.

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:51.203
Not a wise day
to undertake such a journey.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:54.335
Extremely inauspicious,
Mr. Fielding.

01:08:54.506 --> 01:08:56.212
Godbole.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.807
I wouldn't have missed this
for anything.

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:17.350
Memsahib.

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:20.066
- Thank you. Yes.
- Tea coming.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:23.649
He's a relief after Anthony.

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:26.285
Rather a strange place
to do the cooking.

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:35.081
I feel rather embarrassed
when people I dislike are good to me.

01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:37.917
And I really don't care
for Mrs. Callendar.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:41.550
But she's visiting a clinic, she says
the road goes up to below the caves.

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:45.053
We better leave in half an hour.
Would you care for a coffee?

01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:40.859
- Miss Quested.
- Oh, no.

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.524
Is Mrs. Moore awake?

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:51.203
Yes, but please, go in.

01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:54.785
Don't worry, Miss Quested. Look!

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:57.917
I am Douglas Fairbanks.

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:04.833
Tell me, dear.
What's going on out there?

01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:11.306
Mrs. Moore, we are almost there.

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.433
I will now explain to you
about the ladder.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.685
It is to be your big surprise.

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:42.059
You cannot imagine
how you honor me.

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:48.441
I feel that I am journeying
back into my past...

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.072
...and that I'm a Mogul emperor.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:07.584
Sometimes I shut my eyes...

01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:11.878
...and dream
I have splendid clothes again...

01:13:12.472 --> 01:13:15.806
...and that I'm riding into battle
behind Alamgir.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.637
He, too, rode an elephant.

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:11.812
Horrid, stuffy place, really.

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:13.855
Everything is very well arranged.

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:16.445
And here, ladies, is your port.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:24.408
The best caves are higher up,
under the Kawa Dol...

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.087
...but we start in this one.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:30.751
The guide says
everyone to go in quietly.

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:32.131
All sounds make an echo...

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:35.384
...and many sounds
create inharmonious effect.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.763
I do hope I shall be all right.

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:40.890
In my early days
with Ronny's father...

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:44.519
...I made rather a fool of myself
in the chamber of horrors.

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:47.101
Horrors? What horrors?

01:14:47.275 --> 01:14:49.312
The waxwork museum.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.898
He was a very conventional young man,
which made it all rather worse.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:57.357
- This was not Stella's father?
- No,no.

01:14:57.535 --> 01:15:00.653
He was very unconventional.

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:03.325
My goodness me.

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:12.129
Come. Hassan, Abdul, Selim.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:55.897
Kawa Dol.

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:31.807
Mrs. Moore.

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:37.184
Please, please.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:32.330
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Yes.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.868
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:39.833
Godbole never mentioned the echo.

01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:43.962
No. And far too many people.

01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:48.217
- Would you like something to drink?
- Oh, thank you.

01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:54.260
I suppose“.

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:56.930
...like many old people...

01:18:57.108 --> 01:18:59.065
...I sometimes think...

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:02.068
...we are merely passing figures...

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.863
...in a godless universe.

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:08.900
Get me some water.

01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:18.247
- There you are.
- Thank you, my dear.

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:21.382
I didn't know you'd gone.

01:19:21.549 --> 01:19:23.256
There, now.

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:29.004
We should be thinking of moving on
before the sun gets too high.

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.636
Do forgive me, Dr. Aziz.

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.928
I'm rather tired,
so I think I'll stay here.

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:37.641
I've never been a good walker...

01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:40.182
...and you two will get on much better
without me.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.643
Dear Mrs. Moore, nothing to forgive.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:47.314
You're right. It is quite a big climb.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:49.524
And I'm glad you're not coming...

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:53.536
...because you're treating rne
with true frankness, as a friend.

01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:56.531
I am your friend.

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:59.667
- So may I make a suggestion?
- Of course.

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:02.204
Don't take quite so many people
with you this time.

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:06.124
I think you'll find it more convenient.
It does get rather crowded.

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:08.543
Exactly. Exactly.

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:11.053
We shall take just the guide, right?

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:12.600
Quite right.

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:14.973
And enjoy yourselves.

01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:08.941
It's almost a mirage.

01:21:15.955 --> 01:21:17.946
Dr. Aziz.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.782
May I ask you something
rather personal?

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.748
- You were married, weren't you?
- Yes, indeed.

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:34.212
Did you love your wife
when you married her?

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:39.513
We never set eyes on each other
until the day we were married.

01:21:39.687 --> 01:21:42.145
It was all arranged by our families.

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:44.305
I only saw her face in a photograph.

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:49.314
What about love?

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:54.577
We were a man and a woman...

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:57.284
...and we were young.

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:03.642
Dr. Aziz...

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.137
...did you have more than one wife?

01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:10.817
One. One, in my case.

01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:23.075
I'll be back in a moment.

01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:18.690
Miss Quested?

01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:44.719
Miss Quested?

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:00.314
Miss Quested?

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:10.996
Miss Quested?

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:33.974
What's happened?

01:26:34.147 --> 01:26:38.641
- Elephant taking bath, memsahib.
- Something else.

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:10.469
Miss Quested!

01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:14.135
Miss Quested!

01:27:15.898 --> 01:27:18.230
Miss Quested!

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:30.158
Miss Quested?

01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:35.285
Fool.

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:03.745
- Morning, Mrs. Moore.
- Mr. Fielding.

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:07.586
So sorry about this morning.
Everything going well?

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:11.339
Have you seen Miss Quested
and Dr. Aziz?

01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:13.925
No, I've just walked up
from the road.

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:18.138
I'm dying for a drink.
Be with you in a moment.

01:29:23.734 --> 01:29:25.145
Good Lord.

01:29:32.576 --> 01:29:36.319
Oh, Mr. Fielding,
I'm so glad you're here.

01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:39.659
Oh, I was coming over to you.
Nothing wrong?

01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:41.574
Not exactly.

01:29:41.752 --> 01:29:44.210
They went off with the guide
an hour ago.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.620
More, in fact, and somehow--

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:49.756
I don't know this place,
but I'm sure they'll be back soon.

01:29:49.926 --> 01:29:53.669
Fielding! Fielding!

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:59.637
Fielding.

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:03.763
- Fielding, I've so wanted you.
- Where is Miss Quested?

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:07.308
- What is it?
- She-- She went down the road.

01:30:07.486 --> 01:30:11.320
I think she met Mrs. Callendar.
It looked like her car.

01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:14.608
Of course it was her car.
She drove me here.

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:19.278
Why did Miss Quested go off
with Mrs. Callendar?

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:20.946
I don't know.

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:24.662
But, Dr. Aziz,
when did you part with her?

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:28.750
- I don't understand.
- Nor do I. I--

01:30:28.924 --> 01:30:31.461
I went around the corner
to have a cigarette.

01:30:31.635 --> 01:30:33.091
And?

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:36.629
When I came back, the guide couldn't
remember which cave she'd gone into.

01:30:36.807 --> 01:30:39.344
So I looked in all the caves,
and when I came out of--

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.927
I think it was the third cave.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:48.520
--I saw these, and-- And then--

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:51.856
Why, I think it was then I--
I heard the car.

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:55.193
So I ran over to the edge
and I saw Miss Quested getting in.

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:59.361
And then she drove away
with Mrs. Callendar.

01:31:00.122 --> 01:31:01.704
That's all.

01:31:03.375 --> 01:31:05.286
And these.

01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:11.213
I think we'd all better go back.

01:31:12.717 --> 01:31:18.178
Mrs. Moore,
our great day is in tatters.

01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:22.269
I will never forgive myself.

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:30.850
Aziz is an innocent.

01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:35.897
- Something else must have happened.
- Of course something else happened.

01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:39.783
This is a dangerous place
for new arrivals.

01:31:45.167 --> 01:31:48.751
I can't get my clothes off.

01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:55.333
Calm down, dear.
Do your best to relax.

01:32:10.442 --> 01:32:15.937
You'll be better very soon now.

01:32:28.627 --> 01:32:30.538
After we've seen off Mrs. Moore...

01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:34.455
...like it or not, I'm gonna take you
back for a good, stiff drink.

01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:38.877
Here we are.
Good Lord. Quite a crowd.

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:02.324
Dr. Aziz, it is my painful duty
to arrest you.

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:06.658
- What on earth are you talking about?
- Sir, I'm instructed not to say.

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:08.913
Don't answer like that.
Produce your warrant.

01:33:09.084 --> 01:33:13.669
Sir, excuse me. No warrant is required
under these particular circumstances.

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:16.337
Please refer to
Superintendent McBryde.

01:33:16.508 --> 01:33:18.169
We certainly will.

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:20.755
Come on, old chap.
Some ridiculous mistake.

01:33:21.721 --> 01:33:26.261
Dr. Aziz, will you please come?
A closed conveyance is in the yard.

01:33:30.397 --> 01:33:34.356
For God's sake.
Never, never act the criminal.

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:37.860
McBryde's a decent fellow.
We'll see him together.

01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:40.942
But my children, my name.

01:33:41.116 --> 01:33:43.574
Nothing of the sort.
We're coming, Mr. Haq.

01:33:43.743 --> 01:33:46.735
- What is it?
- Come, I've got a car waiting outside.

01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:48.654
- But that is--
- Come.

01:33:48.832 --> 01:33:51.290
That's Mr. Fieldings
and Dr. Aziz's compartment.

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:53.791
Come along. I'll explain everything
as soon as we--

01:33:53.962 --> 01:33:56.078
I can't possibly leave
without speaking to him.

01:33:56.256 --> 01:33:58.543
Please come along, Mother.
I know what I'm doing.

01:33:58.717 --> 01:34:01.425
Make way, please.
Make way, please.

01:34:05.598 --> 01:34:07.054
Come on.

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:10.972
Take my arm. I'll see you through.

01:34:24.868 --> 01:34:26.700
Fielding.

01:34:27.746 --> 01:34:30.158
Fielding, I want a word with you.

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:36.748
Please, please don't leave me.

01:34:36.921 --> 01:34:41.131
I have to go. I'll be with you
as soon as I possibly can.

01:35:03.782 --> 01:35:06.524
- Please, Mother, come along.
- I will not.

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:12.537
Something very terrible
is happening.

01:35:27.013 --> 01:35:31.223
- Absolutely impossible. Grotesque.
- I'm afraid not.

01:35:31.393 --> 01:35:33.680
But who brings this
infamous charge?

01:35:33.853 --> 01:35:38.438
Mrs. Callendar, who witnessed
the poor girl's flight down the ravine...

01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:41.312
...and the victim herself.

01:35:41.486 --> 01:35:44.774
Miss Quested accuses Dr. Aziz
of attempted rape?

01:35:44.948 --> 01:35:46.484
- Yes.
- Then she's mad.

01:35:47.033 --> 01:35:49.149
I cannot pass that remark.

01:35:49.869 --> 01:35:51.826
I'm sorry, sir...

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:55.956
...but the charge must rest
on some dreadful misunderstanding.

01:35:56.126 --> 01:35:57.662
Five minutes will clear it up.

01:35:57.836 --> 01:36:00.669
It does indeed rest
on a misunderstanding.

01:36:00.839 --> 01:36:03.126
I've had 25 years' experience
in this country...

01:36:03.299 --> 01:36:05.506
...and I've never known anything
but disaster...

01:36:05.677 --> 01:36:10.467
...when English and Indians
attempt to be intimate.

01:36:49.888 --> 01:36:53.802
Oh, I hate these damned festivals.
I'll be glad when it's over.

01:36:54.184 --> 01:36:57.176
Always have a feeling
they might go over the top.

01:36:57.937 --> 01:36:59.553
You have a visitor.

01:37:07.322 --> 01:37:10.781
Think I'll be off. See you tonight.

01:37:12.577 --> 01:37:16.036
She hit him with these.

01:37:17.332 --> 01:37:19.448
That's how she escaped.

01:37:19.626 --> 01:37:23.244
If he had assaulted her, he'd scarcely
bring the evidence back with him.

01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:27.255
- Doesn't surprise me.
- I don't follow.

01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:30.550
When you think of crime,
you think of English crime.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.180
The psychology's different here,
and particularly in regard to women.

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:37.682
I've been going through his wallet.

01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:43.351
Here's a letter from a friend
who apparently keeps a brothel.

01:37:44.275 --> 01:37:46.312
I don't want to hear
his private letters.

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:50.111
It'll have to be quoted in court
as bearing on his morals.

01:37:50.281 --> 01:37:53.774
Our respectable young doctor
was fixing up to see tarts in Calcutta.

01:37:53.952 --> 01:37:55.283
Oh, come on.

01:37:55.453 --> 01:37:59.572
You may have the right to throw
stones at a man for that, but I haven't.

01:38:08.091 --> 01:38:10.423
- Tell them to wait.
- Sir?

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.800
Aye, it starts already.

01:38:12.971 --> 01:38:15.963
Vakil Hamidullah and Mahmoud Ali.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:18.268
Legal advisers to the prisoner.

01:38:18.434 --> 01:38:20.095
Where is Miss Quested now?

01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:23.183
Staying with the Callendars
until she's out of danger.

01:38:23.356 --> 01:38:24.471
What danger?

01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:28.141
She has a fever, but much worse...

01:38:28.319 --> 01:38:31.732
...literally hundreds of cactus spines
are embedded in her arms and legs.

01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:35.240
Till they're removed, there's a danger
of them entering the bloodstream.

01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:36.650
Yes.

01:38:36.828 --> 01:38:40.071
Her scramble down that ravine,
it was so precipitant...

01:38:40.248 --> 01:38:44.162
...it started a small avalanche of stones
which stopped Mrs. Callendar's car.

01:38:44.335 --> 01:38:47.669
Now, she hooted,
thinking work was going on above...

01:38:47.839 --> 01:38:49.546
...and then she saw her.

01:38:49.716 --> 01:38:52.549
She had got among some cactuses
and was beginning to panic.

01:38:57.682 --> 01:39:00.674
I suppose there's no possibility
of my seeing Miss Quested.

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:03.014
She's in no state to see anyone.

01:39:03.187 --> 01:39:06.851
Callendar's placed her under sedation
and proposes to keep her for days.

01:39:07.025 --> 01:39:11.770
- He's worried about shock.
- I see, but afterwards?

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:14.813
Why on earth do you want
to see her?

01:39:15.908 --> 01:39:21.119
I want to ask her if she's certain,
dead certain, that it was Aziz.

01:39:21.289 --> 01:39:22.905
Callendar could ask her that.

01:39:23.833 --> 01:39:26.916
I want someone who believes in him
to ask her.

01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:29.953
What difference would that make?

01:39:30.131 --> 01:39:32.964
She's surrounded by people
who don't trust Indians.

01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:40.597
Look, I don't want to be an alarmist,
but in my opinion...

01:39:40.767 --> 01:39:43.976
...the situation is going to become
very nasty in the next few weeks.

01:39:44.145 --> 01:39:45.886
I would think so.

01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:48.392
May I see Aziz?

01:39:49.484 --> 01:39:51.691
Only on a magistrate's order.

01:39:51.861 --> 01:39:56.071
- To whom do I apply?
- The city magistrate.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:04.576
Nothing else excepting clothes, sir,
but these were under the bed.

01:40:09.087 --> 01:40:11.829
- Very useful, Haq.
- Thank you, sir.

01:40:12.006 --> 01:40:14.247
And there is also that.

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:24.932
- That's his wife.
- How do you know that?

01:40:25.478 --> 01:40:28.641
He showed me that photograph.
She's dead.

01:40:31.317 --> 01:40:32.432
I see.

01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:36.103
Well, I must press on with a report.

01:40:36.781 --> 01:40:38.818
I hope to see you at the club
on Saturday.

01:40:38.991 --> 01:40:41.608
I believe Turton wants us all there.

01:40:54.757 --> 01:40:57.795
You are very good to greet us
in this public fashion, Mr. Fielding.

01:40:57.969 --> 01:40:59.130
Oh, for goodness' sake.

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:01.715
Did Mr. McBryde say anything
when my card came in?

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.630
- No.
- I'm wanting bail.

01:41:03.808 --> 01:41:05.640
Do you think my application
annoyed him?

01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:08.677
He wasn't annoyed, and if he was,
what does it matter?

01:41:08.855 --> 01:41:10.892
I might prejudice him against Aziz.

01:41:11.065 --> 01:41:14.103
Nonsense.
This is no way to be thinking.

01:41:14.277 --> 01:41:17.486
Aziz is innocent, and everything we do
must be based on that.

01:41:17.655 --> 01:41:21.489
Mr. Fielding, are you on our side
against your own people?

01:41:22.076 --> 01:41:24.158
It would seem so.

01:41:24.579 --> 01:41:26.490
I think we'd better go
somewhere else.

01:41:32.712 --> 01:41:35.670
We've been thinking about who
should be counsel for defense.

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.422
You, surely.

01:41:37.592 --> 01:41:41.881
We need someone from a distance,
someone who cannot be intimidated.

01:41:42.388 --> 01:41:47.098
- Have you heard of Amritrao?
- Amritrao? The Calcutta man?

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:48.679
A high reputation.

01:41:48.853 --> 01:41:52.016
Notoriously anti-British.
Freedom movement.

01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:54.022
- That worries me.
- Why?

01:41:54.192 --> 01:41:57.059
Amritrao would be regarded
as a political challenge.

01:41:57.236 --> 01:42:00.695
When I saw my friend's private papers
carried in just now...

01:42:00.865 --> 01:42:02.902
...in the arms of that
police inspector...

01:42:03.075 --> 01:42:05.533
...I said, "Amritrao is the man
to clear this up."

01:42:05.703 --> 01:42:07.569
Let's not go too fast.

01:42:07.747 --> 01:42:10.580
We're bound to win.
There's nothing else we can do.

01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:13.037
She'll never be able to
substantiate the charges.

01:42:19.383 --> 01:42:23.092
She's been complaining
about an echo in her head.

01:42:24.138 --> 01:42:28.177
- What about the echo?
- She can't get rid of it.

01:42:29.227 --> 01:42:32.060
I don't suppose she ever will.

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:37.527
Back in a moment.

01:42:43.241 --> 01:42:44.982
Mother, that was unkind.

01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:47.742
Unkind? Unkind?

01:42:47.912 --> 01:42:50.745
What about poor Dr. Aziz
and those terrible police?

01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:54.950
- Mother, quiet, please.
- I won't be quiet.

01:42:55.127 --> 01:42:56.743
Aziz is certainly innocent.

01:42:59.549 --> 01:43:00.755
You don't know that.

01:43:00.925 --> 01:43:03.337
I know about people's characters,
as you call them.

01:43:03.511 --> 01:43:05.343
It's not the sort of thing he would do.

01:43:05.805 --> 01:43:08.797
Whatever you think, the case
has got to come before a magistrate.

01:43:08.975 --> 01:43:12.263
It really must.
The machinery has started.

01:43:13.855 --> 01:43:15.391
Yes.

01:43:15.565 --> 01:43:20.856
She has started the machinery.
It will work to its end.

01:43:30.204 --> 01:43:33.071
- Godbole.
- I see you are in a hurry.

01:43:33.249 --> 01:43:35.616
Yes, I've got to get out
and go back into town.

01:43:35.793 --> 01:43:38.785
May I speak to you
just for a moment?

01:43:38.963 --> 01:43:42.172
Yes, come in,
if you don't mind me changing.

01:43:47.263 --> 01:43:50.255
I wanted to apologize
for this morning.

01:43:50.433 --> 01:43:52.390
Oh, it's all right.

01:43:53.895 --> 01:43:56.478
I hope the expedition
was successful.

01:43:56.647 --> 01:43:59.309
- The news hasn't reached you, then.
- Oh, yes.

01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:02.350
No, a dreadful thing has happened.
Aziz has been arrested.

01:44:02.528 --> 01:44:04.565
Oh, yes, that is all
around the college.

01:44:06.115 --> 01:44:09.153
An expedition where that occurs
can hardly be called successful.

01:44:10.828 --> 01:44:14.116
- I cannot say. I was not there.
- No.

01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:19.831
I must not detain you,
but I have a private difficulty...

01:44:20.004 --> 01:44:22.996
...on which I require your help.

01:44:23.174 --> 01:44:25.541
I'm leaving your service shortly,
as you know.

01:44:25.718 --> 01:44:26.753
Indeed.

01:44:26.928 --> 01:44:29.010
I'm returning to the place
of my childhood...

01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:31.592
...to take charge of education there.

01:44:31.766 --> 01:44:33.677
I want to start a school...

01:44:33.851 --> 01:44:37.310
...that will be as much like this
as possible.

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:38.845
Well?

01:44:39.023 --> 01:44:40.980
The point on which I
desire your advice...

01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:44.063
...is what name should be given
to the school.

01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:47.615
A name for the school?

01:44:47.782 --> 01:44:49.864
A suitable title.

01:44:51.786 --> 01:44:54.653
Godbole, have you grasped
that Aziz is in prison?

01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:56.036
Yes, yes.

01:44:56.207 --> 01:44:58.073
I meant that when you are
less worried...

01:44:58.250 --> 01:45:00.958
...you might think the matter over.

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:04.871
I had thought,
with your permission...

01:45:05.049 --> 01:45:08.383
...of the Richard Fielding
High School.

01:45:08.594 --> 01:45:12.804
But failing that,
the King Emperor George V.

01:45:12.974 --> 01:45:15.841
Godbole, let me ask you something.

01:45:16.018 --> 01:45:18.134
I was under the impression
that you liked Aziz.

01:45:18.312 --> 01:45:19.723
Most certainly.

01:45:19.897 --> 01:45:23.185
Then how can you be so indifferent?
Don't you care what happens to him?

01:45:23.359 --> 01:45:26.442
Yes, yes, but it is of no consequence
if I care or do not care.

01:45:26.612 --> 01:45:28.899
The outcome is already decided.

01:45:29.073 --> 01:45:31.690
- Destiny. Karma.
- Just so.

01:45:31.867 --> 01:45:35.952
Mr. Fielding, we are all part
of a pattern we cannot perceive.

01:45:36.122 --> 01:45:37.157
No doubt.

01:45:37.331 --> 01:45:40.574
Why did Mrs. Moore
bring Miss Quested to Chandrapore?

01:45:40.751 --> 01:45:43.004
To marry the city magistrate.

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:48.836
Yes, or to go to the Marabar
with Dr. Aziz.

01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:52.128
Or perhaps to meet you.

01:45:52.304 --> 01:45:54.170
Very beguiling, but at this moment...

01:45:54.348 --> 01:45:57.010
...my only interest
is to do something for Aziz.

01:45:57.184 --> 01:46:00.267
Excuse me, but nothing you do
will change the outcome.

01:46:00.438 --> 01:46:03.021
So do nothing.
Is that your philosophy?

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:05.932
My philosophy is,
"You can do what you like...

01:46:06.110 --> 01:46:09.068
...but the outcome will be the same."

01:46:33.387 --> 01:46:35.253
Did you get bail?

01:46:35.431 --> 01:46:38.469
They're afraid your presence
might incite further trouble.

01:46:38.642 --> 01:46:40.383
Even riots.

01:46:44.482 --> 01:46:47.474
We've just received a telegram
from Calcutta.

01:46:47.651 --> 01:46:49.062
From Calcutta?

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:54.606
- Amritrao is going to defend you.
- Amritrao?

01:46:54.784 --> 01:46:57.651
Read. Read.

01:47:01.624 --> 01:47:07.540
- What is disbursement?
- Fee. He will not accept a fee.

01:47:38.369 --> 01:47:41.157
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:47:43.124 --> 01:47:45.365
There's not the least cause for alarm.

01:47:45.543 --> 01:47:48.706
I want everything to go on
precisely as usual...

01:47:48.879 --> 01:47:51.997
...so don't start carrying arms about.

01:47:52.174 --> 01:47:54.632
Ladies, don't go out any more
than you can help...

01:47:54.802 --> 01:47:56.793
...and don't talk
before your servants.

01:47:56.971 --> 01:48:01.431
Remember, one isolated Indian
has attempted--

01:48:01.851 --> 01:48:04.468
Has been charged
with an attempted crime...

01:48:04.645 --> 01:48:07.433
...and he will be brought to trial.

01:48:08.732 --> 01:48:11.394
Hadley, those drums
are merely the festival, of course.

01:48:11.569 --> 01:48:15.813
Yes, indeed, and no doubt they'll be
banging away throughout the night.

01:48:17.575 --> 01:48:20.283
Apologies, collector sahib,
everyone.

01:48:20.452 --> 01:48:23.911
Heaslop's just behind me, and I want
to say a word before he comes in.

01:48:24.081 --> 01:48:27.870
- Of course.
- He needs all our support.

01:48:28.043 --> 01:48:31.035
Fact is, he blames himself
for allowing such an expedition.

01:48:31.213 --> 01:48:33.591
As indeed do I,
for giving the wretch leave.

01:48:33.757 --> 01:48:37.796
Then there's his mother. It's been an
unsettling experience for an old lady.

01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:41.338
The good news is that the victim
herself has greatly improved and--

01:48:41.515 --> 01:48:44.849
Heaslop, come along in.
Good to have you with us.

01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:47.730
For goodness' sake,
do sit down, please.

01:48:47.897 --> 01:48:49.979
Up here, Ronny.
Come and join us up here.

01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:53.562
Thank you, sir.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

01:48:53.736 --> 01:48:55.352
Please do sit down.

01:48:56.488 --> 01:48:58.525
Some of us never got up.

01:48:58.699 --> 01:49:01.487
We were delighted to hear the major's
report on Miss Quested.

01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:04.743
Thank you, sir. I didn't mean to
interrupt the meeting in this way.

01:49:04.914 --> 01:49:09.408
Not at all. I was saying before
you arrived that you'd refused bail.

01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:15.956
I was about to add that there's
a certain member here present...

01:49:16.133 --> 01:49:19.501
...who is known to be in contact
with the prisoner's defense.

01:49:20.638 --> 01:49:22.800
I'd like to say one can't
run with the hare...

01:49:22.973 --> 01:49:27.308
...and hunt with the hounds.
At least not in this country.

01:49:30.898 --> 01:49:35.017
- I would like to say something, sir.
- Please do.

01:49:35.861 --> 01:49:41.447
I believe Dr. Aziz is innocent.
I shall await the verdict of the court.

01:49:41.617 --> 01:49:43.324
If he is found guilty...

01:49:43.494 --> 01:49:46.657
...I shall resign from the college
and leave India.

01:49:47.122 --> 01:49:49.739
I resign from the club now.

01:50:05.015 --> 01:50:07.848
She's old. We mustn't forget that.

01:50:08.602 --> 01:50:11.094
Old people never take things
as one expects.

01:50:12.523 --> 01:50:17.142
They can cause
a great deal of trouble.

01:50:35.879 --> 01:50:37.745
Are you all right, Mother?

01:50:37.923 --> 01:50:40.836
Just-- Just having a little rest.

01:50:41.010 --> 01:50:42.626
It's very hot.

01:50:42.803 --> 01:50:45.716
Yes, it is, and I do wish
I could persuade you...

01:50:45.889 --> 01:50:48.472
...not to undertake such a journey
at this time of year.

01:50:48.642 --> 01:50:52.727
At least stay until the monsoon.
It's very close now.

01:50:53.230 --> 01:50:57.565
So much to do.
So little time to do it.

01:50:57.735 --> 01:50:59.726
To do what, Mother?

01:51:00.612 --> 01:51:04.071
Settle things up. See Stella.

01:51:05.576 --> 01:51:10.036
Get away from all this muddle
and fuss into some cave of my own.

01:51:10.205 --> 01:51:12.617
Some shelf.

01:51:12.791 --> 01:51:16.329
Quite so, but meanwhile,
the trial is coming on.

01:51:17.921 --> 01:51:20.959
I've told you before, I don't want
to have anything to do with it.

01:51:21.133 --> 01:51:23.465
The fact remains that you are
an important witness.

01:51:23.635 --> 01:51:27.594
You dropped off after the first cave
and let Adela go on with him alone.

01:51:27.765 --> 01:51:30.006
And no one blames you, Mother.

01:51:30.184 --> 01:51:32.846
He managed the whole thing
by cramming in villagers...

01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:36.684
...and frightening you with that echo.
Mumbo jumbo, but very effective.

01:51:36.857 --> 01:51:39.315
You will never understand
the nature of that place...

01:51:39.485 --> 01:51:42.898
...nor will anyone else in that
ridiculous court of yours.

01:51:43.072 --> 01:51:46.815
- I don't wish to discuss it further.
- Very well, Mother.

01:51:46.992 --> 01:51:49.450
Will you at least stay
for our marriage?

01:51:50.496 --> 01:51:54.455
- You are getting married?
- Of course. Why do you ask?

01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:59.586
I wondered.
All this rubbish about love.

01:51:59.755 --> 01:52:03.669
Love in a church, love in a cave,
as if there were the least difference.

01:52:04.968 --> 01:52:09.053
And I held up from my business
over such trifles.

01:52:09.223 --> 01:52:11.305
I don't understand you.

01:52:11.475 --> 01:52:15.343
I've never understood you,
any more than you've understood rne.

01:52:17.856 --> 01:52:19.972
And what of Adela?

01:52:21.944 --> 01:52:27.940
- I like Adela. She has character.
- Then don't you want to help her?

01:52:29.326 --> 01:52:33.661
Nothing I can say or do
will make the least difference.

01:52:33.831 --> 01:52:37.995
If that is really how you feel, Mother,
then you must go.

01:52:50.264 --> 01:52:51.971
Goodbye.

01:54:09.801 --> 01:54:14.261
You mustn't upset yourself, my dear.
The verdiot's a foregone conclusion.

01:54:14.431 --> 01:54:17.264
It isn't that. I'm all right, really.

01:54:17.434 --> 01:54:20.301
You almost certainly won't be called
until tomorrow.

01:54:20.479 --> 01:54:22.641
McBryde'll take up
most of the morning.

01:54:22.814 --> 01:54:25.772
Then there's Amritrao,
who'll be up to all his tricks...

01:54:25.943 --> 01:54:27.900
...playing to the Indian gallery.

01:55:13.532 --> 01:55:15.148
Jusfice!

01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:29.670
Release him!

01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:49.181
Come along, dear. We're there.

01:57:26.164 --> 01:57:28.280
What are you doing here?

01:57:28.458 --> 01:57:30.620
I'm an interested party, Mrs. Turton.

01:57:30.794 --> 01:57:34.788
- I've handed over to my deputy.
- And who is your deputy?

01:57:47.811 --> 01:57:50.052
Das is a good man, Mrs. Turton.

01:57:58.071 --> 01:58:00.312
Thank you, sir.

01:58:00.490 --> 01:58:02.652
On April the 3rd of this year...

01:58:02.826 --> 01:58:06.114
...Miss Quested
and her friend Mrs. Moore...

01:58:06.288 --> 01:58:08.074
...were invited to a tea party...

01:58:08.248 --> 01:58:10.831
...at the house of the principal
of Government College.

01:58:11.793 --> 01:58:15.661
It was here that prisoner
first met Miss Quested...

01:58:15.839 --> 01:58:18.672
...a young girl fresh from England.

01:58:18.842 --> 01:58:20.298
Until this unfortunate party...

01:58:20.469 --> 01:58:24.258
...the prisoner had never before been
in close proximity to an English girl.

01:58:24.431 --> 01:58:27.093
In consideration
of the ladies present...

01:58:27.267 --> 01:58:30.760
...I will merely allude to the fact
the prisoner is a widower...

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:32.519
...now living alone...

01:58:32.689 --> 01:58:36.023
...and in the course of our evidence,
I shall be providing ample proof...

01:58:36.193 --> 01:58:38.230
...of his state of mind.

01:58:39.070 --> 01:58:42.028
Now, before taking you through
the history of this appalling crime...

01:58:42.199 --> 01:58:46.363
...I want to state what I believe to be
a universal truth.

01:58:46.953 --> 01:58:52.539
The darker races
are attracted to the fairer...

01:58:52.918 --> 01:58:55.876
...but not vice versa.

01:58:56.463 --> 01:59:00.707
Even when the lady is less attractive
than the gentleman?

01:59:01.885 --> 01:59:02.966
Order.

01:59:03.553 --> 01:59:08.798
Order! Order! Order!

02:00:33.143 --> 02:00:37.637
I must warn members of the public
and certain members of the defense...

02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:41.148
...that the insulting behavior
and rowdiness...

02:00:41.318 --> 02:00:43.855
...which marred
yesterday's proceedings...

02:00:44.029 --> 02:00:46.737
...will not be tolerated.

02:00:46.907 --> 02:00:48.739
Well said, Das. Quite right.

02:00:50.368 --> 02:00:53.281
- Mr. McBryde?
- Thank you.

02:00:53.788 --> 02:00:56.371
I shall begin, sir, by reminding you
of my contention...

02:00:56.541 --> 02:00:59.124
...that prisoner proposed
the expedition to the caves...

02:00:59.294 --> 02:01:03.128
...with the premeditated intention
of making advances to Miss Quested.

02:01:04.382 --> 02:01:07.841
I've made it my business to visit
the Marabar during the last few days.

02:01:08.011 --> 02:01:11.925
It's an inaccessible, barren place,
entailing, as you've heard...

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:14.760
...considerable planning
and expense to get there.

02:01:14.935 --> 02:01:16.721
The caves themselves...

02:01:16.895 --> 02:01:20.388
...are dark, featureless
and without interest...

02:01:20.565 --> 02:01:23.227
...except for a strange echo.

02:01:24.194 --> 02:01:27.528
A curious place
for such an elaborate picnic.

02:01:27.822 --> 02:01:31.190
The servants were all supplied
by prisoner's Indian friends...

02:01:31.368 --> 02:01:33.860
...with the one exception
of the witness Anthony.

02:01:34.829 --> 02:01:38.117
Anthony had received explicit
instructions from Mr. Heaslop...

02:01:38.291 --> 02:01:43.707
...to stay with the ladies at all times,
yet he remained behind.

02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:45.625
Yesterday, you heard him admit...

02:01:45.799 --> 02:01:48.882
...that he had accepted money
from the prisoner...

02:01:49.052 --> 02:01:52.044
...minutes before the departure
of the train.

02:01:52.514 --> 02:01:55.381
And that brought us to Mr. Fielding.

02:01:56.309 --> 02:01:59.643
We are asked to believe that he was
prevented from catching the train...

02:01:59.813 --> 02:02:02.896
...because another friend
of the prisoner's, Professor Godbole...

02:02:03.066 --> 02:02:05.603
...was saying his prayers.

02:02:06.778 --> 02:02:08.644
Prayers.

02:02:09.072 --> 02:02:11.985
After a most unpleasant altercation,
I withdrew my hypothesis...

02:02:12.158 --> 02:02:16.072
...that similar persuasion had
contributed towards this religious zeal.

02:02:16.246 --> 02:02:18.533
I object, sir.

02:02:18.707 --> 02:02:21.540
Mr. McBryde is quite blatantly
using this opportunity...

02:02:21.710 --> 02:02:23.417
...to repeat the slander.

02:02:24.254 --> 02:02:25.415
Objection sustained.

02:02:29.759 --> 02:02:31.716
Order!

02:02:32.262 --> 02:02:33.627
Order!

02:02:35.849 --> 02:02:37.886
Order!

02:02:42.731 --> 02:02:47.100
Prisoner had yet to rid himself
of a third impediment.

02:02:47.277 --> 02:02:49.484
The lady in question...

02:02:49.654 --> 02:02:53.864
...suffered from what is known
in medical parlance as claustrophobia.

02:02:54.701 --> 02:02:57.489
Prisoner achieved his objective
by entering the first cave...

02:02:57.662 --> 02:03:00.780
...with Miss Quested and the guide,
leaving this elderly lady in the rear...

02:03:00.957 --> 02:03:04.700
...where she was crushed and
crowded by servants and villagers.

02:03:04.878 --> 02:03:05.993
Mrs. Moore.

02:03:07.172 --> 02:03:08.879
- He's speaking of Mrs. Moore.
- Quiet!

02:03:09.049 --> 02:03:11.962
Are you accusing my client of
attempted murder as well as rape?

02:03:12.135 --> 02:03:14.752
Who is this lady he is
talking about? I don't understand.

02:03:14.929 --> 02:03:16.966
The lady I met in the mosque.
Mrs. Moore.

02:03:17.849 --> 02:03:20.466
Mrs. Moore?

02:03:20.643 --> 02:03:22.509
You speak of Mrs. Moore?

02:03:22.687 --> 02:03:24.974
I don't propose to call her.

02:03:25.148 --> 02:03:27.856
You don't propose to call her
because you can't.

02:03:28.068 --> 02:03:31.151
She was smuggled out of the country
because she was on our side.

02:03:31.321 --> 02:03:32.903
She would've proved his innocence.

02:03:33.073 --> 02:03:35.815
You could have called her yourself.
Neither side called her.

02:03:35.992 --> 02:03:39.826
- Neither may quote her as evidence.
- But she was kept from us.

02:03:40.705 --> 02:03:43.493
This is English justice?

02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:45.991
This is your British raj?

02:03:46.169 --> 02:03:49.161
Just give us back Mrs. Moore
for five minutes.

02:03:49.798 --> 02:03:51.505
If the point is of any interest...

02:03:51.674 --> 02:03:56.009
...my mother should be reaching Aden
at noon today, their time.

02:03:56.179 --> 02:03:59.262
- Banished. By you.
- Please. Please.

02:03:59.432 --> 02:04:03.926
- This is no way to defend your case.
- I'm not defending a case.

02:04:04.104 --> 02:04:07.688
And you are not trying one.
We are both slaves!

02:04:07.857 --> 02:04:10.645
Mr. Mahmoud Ali,
unless you sit down...

02:04:10.819 --> 02:04:12.856
...I shall have to
exercise my authority.

02:04:13.029 --> 02:04:16.693
Do so. This trial is a farce.

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:20.116
I'm going. I've ruined my career.

02:04:20.286 --> 02:04:23.028
Mrs. Moore.
Where are you, Mrs. Moore?

02:04:23.206 --> 02:04:26.289
- We want Mrs. Moore! Mrs. Moore.
- Mrs. Moore.

02:04:26.459 --> 02:04:29.121
- Mrs. Moore.
- Order!

02:04:29.295 --> 02:04:32.629
- Order.
- Farewell, my friend!

02:04:41.558 --> 02:04:44.266
They have taken Mrs. Moore.

02:04:47.230 --> 02:04:48.812
Mrs. Moore.

02:04:48.982 --> 02:04:50.893
Mrs. Moore!

02:04:51.067 --> 02:04:52.933
Mrs. Moore.

02:04:53.111 --> 02:04:54.317
Mrs. Moore!

02:04:54.487 --> 02:04:55.727
Mrs. Moore!

02:04:55.905 --> 02:04:56.986
Mrs. Moore!

02:04:57.157 --> 02:04:58.488
Mrs. Moore!

02:04:58.658 --> 02:04:59.898
Mrs. Moore!

02:05:00.076 --> 02:05:01.066
Mrs. Moore!

02:05:01.244 --> 02:05:02.359
Mrs. Moore!

02:05:02.537 --> 02:05:03.868
Mrs. Moore!

02:05:04.038 --> 02:05:05.654
Mrs. Moore!

02:05:05.832 --> 02:05:06.867
Mrs. Moore!

02:05:07.041 --> 02:05:08.327
Mrs. Moore!

02:05:08.501 --> 02:05:10.993
Isn't it strange?

02:05:11.671 --> 02:05:13.662
Rather wonderful.

02:05:14.549 --> 02:05:18.133
- I knew they'd try something like this.
- Quiet, please.

02:05:18.303 --> 02:05:19.464
Poor old Das.

02:05:19.637 --> 02:05:21.423
Quiet.

02:05:21.931 --> 02:05:23.092
Order.

02:05:31.983 --> 02:05:34.315
I apologize for my colleague.

02:05:34.485 --> 02:05:36.567
He is an intimate friend
of our client...

02:05:36.738 --> 02:05:38.775
...and his feelings
have carried him away.

02:05:38.948 --> 02:05:41.531
Mr. Mahmoud Ali
will have to apologize in person.

02:05:41.701 --> 02:05:43.487
Exactly, sir. He must.

02:05:43.661 --> 02:05:48.371
I must repeat that, as a witness,
Mrs. Moore does not exist.

02:05:48.541 --> 02:05:52.409
Neither you, Mr. Amritrao,
nor, Mr. McBryde, you...

02:05:52.587 --> 02:05:55.454
...have any right to surmise
what that lady would have said.

02:05:56.591 --> 02:06:00.960
She is not here, and consequently,
she can say nothing.

02:06:02.639 --> 02:06:05.927
"Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:09.764
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayer.

02:06:09.938 --> 02:06:12.396
We therefore
commit her body to the deep...

02:06:12.565 --> 02:06:15.227
...to be turned into corruption...

02:06:15.401 --> 02:06:18.143
...looking for the resurrection
of the body...

02:06:18.321 --> 02:06:20.403
...when the sea
shall give up her dead."

02:06:30.333 --> 02:06:33.200
"I heard a voice
from heaven saying unto me:

02:06:33.378 --> 02:06:37.542
'Blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord."'

02:06:42.512 --> 02:06:46.551
I now call upon Miss Quested.

02:07:23.094 --> 02:07:25.631
Mrs. Moore!

02:07:26.556 --> 02:07:29.389
Mrs. Moore!

02:07:29.559 --> 02:07:32.392
Mrs. Moore!

02:07:32.812 --> 02:07:35.679
Mrs. Moore!

02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:38.898
Mrs. Moore!

02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:52.286
Place your hand on the book.

02:07:57.086 --> 02:07:58.918
And nothing but the truth.

02:08:00.798 --> 02:08:04.257
Quiet, please. Silence.

02:08:07.096 --> 02:08:08.598
Now, Miss Quested...

02:08:10.391 --> 02:08:12.257
...I would like to take you back...

02:08:12.435 --> 02:08:15.097
...to the moment
when you came out of that first cave...

02:08:15.271 --> 02:08:19.265
...and found
Mrs. Moore collapsed in her chair.

02:08:19.442 --> 02:08:21.604
- Are you with me?
- Yes.

02:08:21.778 --> 02:08:25.066
Did she offer any explanation?

02:08:25.365 --> 02:08:29.450
She said she was upset by the echo
and that she was tired.

02:08:29.619 --> 02:08:31.735
Taking advantage
of her distress and fatigue...

02:08:31.913 --> 02:08:35.122
...prisoner instructed the villagers
and servants to remain behind...

02:08:35.291 --> 02:08:39.000
...and took you off alone
with the guide?

02:08:39.629 --> 02:08:42.121
Yes,
but it was at Mrs. Moore's suggestion.

02:08:42.632 --> 02:08:44.794
I don't quite follow.

02:08:44.967 --> 02:08:48.176
She'd been worried by the crowd
and the stuffiness.

02:08:48.346 --> 02:08:51.839
And was concerned that you might be
subjected to the same ordeal?

02:08:53.059 --> 02:08:54.299
No.

02:08:54.477 --> 02:08:58.061
She wanted us to enjoy ourselves.
She said so.

02:08:58.231 --> 02:08:59.721
She likes Dr. Aziz.

02:09:02.276 --> 02:09:05.234
Yes,
I think I understand the situation.

02:09:05.405 --> 02:09:08.989
Yesterday, Mr. Fielding
said that Mrs. Moore...

02:09:09.158 --> 02:09:11.320
...was what he described as
"charmed" by him.

02:09:11.494 --> 02:09:13.656
It was more than that.

02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:15.036
She liked him.

02:09:15.206 --> 02:09:18.289
Nevertheless, she'd only met him on
two occasions before the crime.

02:09:18.459 --> 02:09:20.917
- Yes.
- So it might have possibly been...

02:09:21.087 --> 02:09:23.328
...a rather impetuous assessment?

02:09:23.965 --> 02:09:26.673
Possibly. She's like that.

02:09:28.177 --> 02:09:29.918
Miss Quested,
you heard this morning...

02:09:30.096 --> 02:09:32.838
...the slur cast on British justice
by the defense.

02:09:33.015 --> 02:09:36.508
It is most important that you tell
the absolute truth of what took place...

02:09:36.686 --> 02:09:40.020
-...painful as it may be.
- I was brought up to tell the truth.

02:09:41.232 --> 02:09:43.018
Of course.

02:09:49.866 --> 02:09:50.947
I'm sorry.

02:09:52.076 --> 02:09:54.192
That's quite all right.

02:09:57.206 --> 02:09:58.913
Now, Miss Quested...

02:10:00.209 --> 02:10:06.125
...you went off up the slope
with the prisoner and the guide?

02:10:06.299 --> 02:10:08.006
Yes.

02:10:08.593 --> 02:10:10.425
Take your time...

02:10:11.262 --> 02:10:14.220
...and cast your mind back.

02:10:21.898 --> 02:10:23.730
Miss Quested?

02:10:26.152 --> 02:10:28.143
Miss Quested?

02:10:28.821 --> 02:10:32.109
We were going up the slope.
ls something wrong?

02:10:34.076 --> 02:10:36.738
I think it may have
partly been my fault.

02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:39.411
Why?

02:10:39.582 --> 02:10:42.950
We'd stopped to look out
over the plain.

02:10:43.252 --> 02:10:44.754
I could hardly see Chandrapore...

02:10:44.921 --> 02:10:47.504
...except through
Mr. Heaslop's binoculars.

02:10:49.592 --> 02:10:51.924
I asked Dr. Aziz...

02:10:52.094 --> 02:10:55.257
...if he loved his wife
when he married her.

02:10:55.973 --> 02:10:57.475
I shouldn't have done that.

02:10:58.267 --> 02:10:59.598
Then why did you do it?

02:11:04.065 --> 02:11:06.727
I was thinking of my own marriage.

02:11:06.901 --> 02:11:10.439
Mr. Heaslop and I
had only just become engaged.

02:11:10.780 --> 02:11:15.525
Seeing Chandrapore so far away...

02:11:17.328 --> 02:11:18.818
...I realized I didn't love him.

02:11:22.375 --> 02:11:24.662
Quiet, please. Quiet.

02:11:42.979 --> 02:11:44.765
Miss Quested...

02:11:44.939 --> 02:11:47.727
...you and the prisoner
continued up to the caves.

02:11:48.693 --> 02:11:50.775
- Yes.
- Where was the guide?

02:11:50.945 --> 02:11:53.357
- He'd gone on ahead.
- Sent on ahead?

02:11:53.531 --> 02:11:56.649
No, he was waiting for us
further along the ledge.

02:11:56.826 --> 02:12:00.160
But when you arrived at the caves,
prisoner left to speak to the guide?

02:12:01.455 --> 02:12:03.196
I don't know
if he spoke to him or not.

02:12:03.374 --> 02:12:06.116
Well, he left you
and went off in his direction?

02:12:06.294 --> 02:12:08.080
Yes.

02:12:08.254 --> 02:12:10.291
And what did you do?

02:12:10.631 --> 02:12:11.666
I waited.

02:12:13.884 --> 02:12:16.012
<i>You said just now:</i>

02:12:16.679 --> 02:12:18.670
<i>"I think it may have been
partly my fault."</i>

02:12:18.848 --> 02:12:20.384
<i>Why?</i>

02:12:21.392 --> 02:12:23.053
<i>I had asked him about love.</i>

02:12:23.227 --> 02:12:27.221
<i>And had thereby
introduced a feeling of intimacy?</i>

02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:29.856
<i>That is what I meant.</i>

02:12:31.736 --> 02:12:33.522
Thank you.

02:12:34.363 --> 02:12:35.524
Mr. McBryde?

02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:45.080
Please tell the court
exactly what happened.

02:12:49.128 --> 02:12:51.119
I lit a match.

02:12:59.555 --> 02:13:01.717
Miss Quested!

02:13:03.893 --> 02:13:06.009
Miss Quested!

02:13:25.039 --> 02:13:26.575
Miss Quested?

02:13:29.835 --> 02:13:32.998
And the prisoner followed you.

02:13:36.008 --> 02:13:39.501
Miss Quested,
the prisoner followed you, didn't he?

02:13:44.475 --> 02:13:46.216
Could I please have a minute...

02:13:46.394 --> 02:13:48.260
...before I reply to that,
Mr. McBryde?

02:13:48.437 --> 02:13:50.178
Certainly.

02:14:00.324 --> 02:14:01.860
I'm...

02:14:05.121 --> 02:14:08.955
I'm not quite sure.

02:14:10.626 --> 02:14:12.663
I beg your pardon?

02:14:13.379 --> 02:14:16.792
You were in the cave,
and the prisoner followed you.

02:14:23.472 --> 02:14:25.463
Well, what do you mean, please?

02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:29.593
- No.
- What is that? What are you saying?

02:14:32.064 --> 02:14:35.602
- I'm afraid I have made a mistake.
- What nature of mistake?

02:14:37.570 --> 02:14:39.982
Dr. Aziz...

02:14:40.322 --> 02:14:42.484
...never followed me into the cave.

02:14:44.076 --> 02:14:45.532
Oh, Miss Quested, let us go on.

02:14:45.703 --> 02:14:49.662
I will read the deposition you signed
when you arrived with Mrs. Callendar.

02:14:49.832 --> 02:14:53.416
Mr. McBryde, you cannot go on.
I was speaking to the witness.

02:14:53.586 --> 02:14:56.328
And the public will be silent.

02:14:57.673 --> 02:15:00.335
Miss Quested,
address your remarks to me.

02:15:00.509 --> 02:15:03.843
And remember, you speak on oath,
Miss Quested.

02:15:04.638 --> 02:15:05.844
Dr. Aziz--

02:15:06.015 --> 02:15:08.507
I stop these proceedings
on medical grounds.

02:15:08.684 --> 02:15:11.051
Quiet. Please sit down.

02:15:16.025 --> 02:15:18.016
You withdraw the accusation,
Miss Quested?

02:15:19.195 --> 02:15:21.027
Answer me.

02:15:21.405 --> 02:15:23.066
I withdraw everything.

02:15:27.286 --> 02:15:30.699
Order. Order.

02:15:31.874 --> 02:15:34.286
Quiet!

02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:38.044
The prisoner is released
without one stain on his character.

02:15:47.056 --> 02:15:50.139
Dr. Aziz is free!

02:16:09.119 --> 02:16:10.280
Are you mad?

02:16:11.747 --> 02:16:12.828
No.

02:18:00.105 --> 02:18:02.096
Bitch.

02:18:04.026 --> 02:18:07.189
- We won!
- Dr. Aziz!

02:18:09.365 --> 02:18:12.198
What do you think
you've been doing?

02:18:22.628 --> 02:18:24.209
Miss Quested?

02:18:29.550 --> 02:18:31.838
Where are you going?

02:18:32.012 --> 02:18:35.471
- I don't know.
- You can't wander about like this.

02:18:35.641 --> 02:18:37.928
Who did you come with?

02:18:38.559 --> 02:18:40.722
- I shall walk.
- What madness.

02:18:40.896 --> 02:18:43.513
This could turn into a riot.

02:18:44.191 --> 02:18:47.855
We'll find my carriage. It's closed.

02:18:59.623 --> 02:19:00.737
Richard!

02:19:00.915 --> 02:19:03.123
- Aziz!
- Richard!

02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:11.924
- I'm coming back.
- Stay with him. Please.

02:19:12.093 --> 02:19:15.587
I can't leave you here.
Anything could happen.

02:19:32.281 --> 02:19:33.941
- There we are.
- Congratulations, sir.

02:19:34.116 --> 02:19:37.154
- We were waiting for you, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

02:19:37.326 --> 02:19:40.945
- Make way, please. Thank you.
- Sir? Sir?

02:19:41.623 --> 02:19:43.614
Where shall he take you?

02:19:44.168 --> 02:19:47.081
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

02:19:49.548 --> 02:19:51.255
Get in.

02:20:02.811 --> 02:20:06.850
- That was Mr. Fielding.
- And Mrs. Moore.

02:20:07.024 --> 02:20:08.810
Mrs. Moore!

02:20:08.984 --> 02:20:13.649
Mrs. Moore! Mrs. Moore!

02:20:18.035 --> 02:20:22.620
Why did you make such a charge
if you were going to withdraw it'?

02:20:25.375 --> 02:20:27.332
I ought to feel grateful to you,
I suppose.

02:20:27.503 --> 02:20:29.835
I don't expect gratitude.

02:20:35.636 --> 02:20:38.253
Did you do it out of pity?

02:20:41.183 --> 02:20:42.173
My echo's gone.

02:20:44.311 --> 02:20:48.396
I call the noise in my head my echo.
I've had it since the cave.

02:20:52.861 --> 02:20:55.569
Might the whole thing have been
an hallucination?

02:20:59.785 --> 02:21:04.450
I have a hunch
that poor old McBryde exorcised you.

02:21:04.623 --> 02:21:08.742
He took you back, step by logical step,
into that cave...

02:21:08.919 --> 02:21:12.037
...and you broke down
quite suddenly.

02:21:12.214 --> 02:21:14.205
I thought you meant
I'd seen a ghost.

02:21:14.383 --> 02:21:16.340
No, no.

02:21:17.594 --> 02:21:19.460
Mrs. Moore believes in ghosts.

02:21:19.638 --> 02:21:22.221
- Well, she's an old lady.
- What?

02:21:22.391 --> 02:21:25.383
No, I only meant
that it's difficult as we get older...

02:21:25.561 --> 02:21:27.893
...not to believe
that the dead live again.

02:21:30.274 --> 02:21:32.891
Because the dead don't live again.

02:21:33.569 --> 02:21:35.731
I fear not.

02:21:37.406 --> 02:21:39.397
So do I.

02:21:42.786 --> 02:21:44.368
Ra nj it?

02:21:44.538 --> 02:21:48.031
He must have gone to the tamasha,
but I can make some tea.

02:21:48.208 --> 02:21:50.370
Oh, forgive me a moment.

02:22:00.512 --> 02:22:02.423
Oh, dear.

02:22:23.327 --> 02:22:26.945
"Annie Blair, fellow passenger."

02:22:35.631 --> 02:22:38.293
I shall never see her again.

02:23:06.495 --> 02:23:09.328
- Godbole.
- The boys said you were back.

02:23:09.498 --> 02:23:11.705
- Yes.
- I'm leaving for Kashmir...

02:23:11.875 --> 02:23:15.163
...early tomorrow morning
to take up my duties...

02:23:15.337 --> 02:23:17.704
...as minister of education.

02:23:17.881 --> 02:23:20.339
I came to say goodbye.

02:23:21.009 --> 02:23:22.750
Yes?

02:23:23.679 --> 02:23:26.922
- Come in.
- Thank you. Thank you.

02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:30.341
Miss Quested.

02:23:31.728 --> 02:23:34.766
Please,
I want to give you my address...

02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:37.602
...and extend an open invitation
for you to visit me.

02:23:37.776 --> 02:23:40.188
Have you seen the Himalayas,
Mr. Fielding?

02:23:40.362 --> 02:23:42.023
No.

02:23:45.867 --> 02:23:47.574
Miss Quested's just had
some bad news.

02:23:47.744 --> 02:23:49.906
Oh, I am sorry.

02:23:56.878 --> 02:23:58.130
Mrs. Moore.

02:23:58.964 --> 02:24:00.546
Yes.

02:24:06.555 --> 02:24:09.718
- Addressed to you.
- Yes.

02:24:10.559 --> 02:24:14.143
- Why did this lady send to you?
- I don't know.

02:24:14.313 --> 02:24:17.806
- Mr. Fielding, I would venture to say--
- Godbole, under the circumstances...

02:24:17.983 --> 02:24:20.896
...I don't think
we should pursue the matter further.

02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:25.438
I'm sorry, Godbole,
but Miss Quested's extremely upset.

02:24:25.615 --> 02:24:27.401
Of course. Of course.
Nevertheless, I--

02:24:27.576 --> 02:24:30.944
I presumably came up
in a casual shipboard conversation.

02:24:31.121 --> 02:24:33.909
No doubt Heaslop will be
hearing from the company.

02:24:35.042 --> 02:24:38.455
- I see.
- I shan't tell Aziz until tomorrow.

02:24:38.628 --> 02:24:41.165
Hamidullah is bound to put on
a celebration tonight...

02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:43.547
...and it'll only upset him.

02:24:43.717 --> 02:24:45.628
Oh, and have you heard
about the damages?

02:24:46.094 --> 02:24:47.175
Damages?

02:24:47.346 --> 02:24:52.432
Amritrao is asking
20,000 rupees damages from...

02:24:53.101 --> 02:24:54.762
Twenty thousand?

02:24:55.812 --> 02:24:57.644
And costs.

02:25:01.610 --> 02:25:05.604
Who could have foretold that Aziz
would be saved by his enemy?

02:25:05.781 --> 02:25:08.398
What now, Mr. Fielding?

02:25:45.987 --> 02:25:48.695
- Aziz?
- Come in.

02:25:52.828 --> 02:25:57.197
Well, what a wonderful day for you.

02:25:57.541 --> 02:26:00.750
I am an Indian at last.

02:26:04.506 --> 02:26:06.372
Where did you take her?

02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:11.172
I took her back to the college.

02:26:12.431 --> 02:26:13.967
Why?

02:26:14.141 --> 02:26:16.803
After this morning,
she had nowhere else to go.

02:26:16.977 --> 02:26:18.217
No?

02:26:18.395 --> 02:26:21.513
Heaslop? The Turtons?

02:26:21.690 --> 02:26:25.183
She had the entire British raj
behind her, pushing her on.

02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:27.226
But when she saw she was wrong,
she stopped...

02:26:27.404 --> 02:26:29.691
...and sent the whole thing
to smithereens.

02:26:29.865 --> 02:26:32.106
I wouldn't have had the courage.

02:26:39.082 --> 02:26:41.369
Do you mind if I sit?

02:26:42.210 --> 02:26:43.917
Please.

02:26:49.217 --> 02:26:50.594
What are you going to do now?

02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:54.469
Hamidullah's giving me a victory party
with fireworks and music.

02:26:54.639 --> 02:26:58.928
Good. But I meant later,
now this dreadful business is over.

02:26:59.102 --> 02:27:01.480
I shall look for another job...

02:27:01.646 --> 02:27:05.685
...hundreds of miles from here,
in an Indian state.

02:27:05.859 --> 02:27:09.227
Out of British India. And you?

02:27:10.238 --> 02:27:12.650
I shall probably go to England
for a long leave.

02:27:15.076 --> 02:27:17.568
Will you and she
be going back on the same boat?

02:27:18.580 --> 02:27:20.287
No.

02:27:20.457 --> 02:27:23.495
I couldn't possibly get away
before the end of next term.

02:27:23.668 --> 02:27:26.786
Miss Quested's going
as soon as she can get a passage.

02:27:27.756 --> 02:27:29.542
I see.

02:27:34.971 --> 02:27:36.052
Look.

02:27:36.223 --> 02:27:38.089
I'm looking.

02:27:38.266 --> 02:27:42.726
Godbole tells me that Amritrao
is asking 20,000 rupees damages.

02:27:42.896 --> 02:27:44.682
And costs.

02:27:44.856 --> 02:27:48.440
I'd hate to see her getting
the worst of both worlds. It'll ruin her.

02:27:48.610 --> 02:27:50.396
And me?

02:27:50.570 --> 02:27:52.186
Pflson?

02:27:52.364 --> 02:27:55.527
My private letters read out in court?

02:27:55.700 --> 02:27:59.284
My wife's photograph taken to
the police to be fingered by McBryde.

02:27:59.454 --> 02:28:02.196
All because a young girl
fresh from England got too much sun?

02:28:02.374 --> 02:28:04.081
I know.

02:28:04.251 --> 02:28:06.663
And I know
what you're going to ask next.

02:28:07.754 --> 02:28:13.921
You're going to ask me
to let her off paying 20,000 rupees.

02:28:14.094 --> 02:28:15.801
Right?

02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:19.547
Then, if I agree...

02:28:19.724 --> 02:28:21.977
...the English will be able to say:

02:28:22.143 --> 02:28:25.477
"Here is an Indian
that almost behaved like a gentleman.

02:28:25.647 --> 02:28:28.560
But for the color of his face,
we might even let him join the club."

02:28:29.442 --> 02:28:32.104
Is that why you came here
to see me?

02:28:34.114 --> 02:28:35.570
Answer me.

02:28:37.784 --> 02:28:41.197
In the end,
you English always stick together.

02:28:41.705 --> 02:28:44.163
I want to have nothing more
to do with any of you.

02:28:45.125 --> 02:28:46.911
Any of you.

02:28:47.669 --> 02:28:51.207
You can go back to the college
and tell her to keep the money.

02:28:51.381 --> 02:28:53.793
Tell her to use it
to buy herself a husband.

02:28:53.967 --> 02:28:55.332
Tell her--

02:28:57.095 --> 02:28:58.677
Look.

02:29:23.496 --> 02:29:24.907
Are you coming with me?

02:29:25.832 --> 02:29:27.448
I don't think so.

02:30:22.347 --> 02:30:26.932
Aziz! Aziz! Aziz!

02:32:12.665 --> 02:32:15.373
This is a great honor, professor.

02:32:16.002 --> 02:32:19.120
- Anything wrong?
- No,no.

02:32:23.051 --> 02:32:27.386
They arrive at the state guesthouse
this afternoon.

02:32:27.931 --> 02:32:30.468
How long have you known
they were coming?

02:32:30.767 --> 02:32:32.349
One month.

02:32:32.519 --> 02:32:35.637
- Possibly two.
- And why did you not tell me?

02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:39.598
One cannot tell anyone anything
unless they are ready to hear it.

02:32:40.068 --> 02:32:41.775
And what does that mean?

02:32:42.237 --> 02:32:45.400
Mr. Fielding wrote you letters
from London and Bombay.

02:32:45.573 --> 02:32:46.779
You tore them up.

02:32:47.408 --> 02:32:49.149
I did.

02:32:49.327 --> 02:32:50.567
That is my point.

02:32:54.290 --> 02:32:57.908
"My dear Aziz,
I have some news for you.

02:32:58.086 --> 02:33:00.498
I am going to marry
someone whom you know."

02:33:00.672 --> 02:33:02.504
The end of a foolish experiment.

02:33:03.716 --> 02:33:06.583
I've made a new life for myself
up here.

02:33:06.761 --> 02:33:08.343
Away from the English.

02:33:08.513 --> 02:33:11.847
I shall be going to the guesthouse
to greet them.

02:33:12.016 --> 02:33:14.474
But my religious duties...

02:33:14.644 --> 02:33:19.559
...will be claiming my full attention
for the next three days.

02:33:20.149 --> 02:33:23.437
He's come all this way to find you.

02:33:24.279 --> 02:33:28.022
Can you not let bygones be bygones
and show them around?

02:33:28.199 --> 02:33:31.362
Sorry, Godbole, but I've had enough
of showing Miss Quested India.

02:33:42.797 --> 02:33:44.959
Stop. Let's stop for a moment.

02:34:41.648 --> 02:34:43.355
We must be getting on.

02:35:56.264 --> 02:35:58.301
Houseboat, sahib.

02:36:00.143 --> 02:36:02.009
Hello?

02:36:03.521 --> 02:36:05.432
Aziz?

02:36:25.043 --> 02:36:27.751
Well, here you are at last.

02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:30.537
I've been
looking for you everywhere.

02:36:41.309 --> 02:36:43.141
Your children?

02:36:43.644 --> 02:36:45.305
Yes.

02:36:45.980 --> 02:36:48.563
I suppose Godbole told you
I was here.

02:36:48.733 --> 02:36:51.316
The minister of education
never tells anyone anything...

02:36:51.486 --> 02:36:52.942
...unless he has to.

02:36:53.112 --> 02:36:56.696
His only piece of information was
that the King George V High School...

02:36:56.866 --> 02:36:58.948
...was destined not to be.

02:36:59.118 --> 02:37:01.655
I was supposed to inspect it.

02:37:01.829 --> 02:37:04.742
Anyhow, here I am.

02:37:07.752 --> 02:37:10.870
I've been visiting schools
all over the country.

02:37:11.047 --> 02:37:13.163
We called in at Chandrapore.

02:37:14.092 --> 02:37:16.925
Your bungalow's been
turned into a shop.

02:37:17.095 --> 02:37:18.711
Turt0n's retired.

02:37:18.888 --> 02:37:21.175
Callendar's been given the push.

02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:24.387
And Hamidullah sends his salaams.

02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:27.052
It was he who told me
you'd moved up here.

02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:30.348
So I wrote, care of Godbole.

02:37:31.692 --> 02:37:33.524
Why didn't you answer my letters?

02:37:33.694 --> 02:37:35.560
You married my enemy.

02:37:35.738 --> 02:37:37.854
Stole my money.

02:37:41.744 --> 02:37:43.860
Aziz, I'm going to surprise you.

02:37:46.833 --> 02:37:48.198
What do you mean?

02:37:48.376 --> 02:37:50.743
My wife is Mrs. Moore's daughter.

02:37:54.507 --> 02:37:57.295
- Stella?
- Stella.

02:37:57.468 --> 02:38:00.426
Miss Quested introduced us.

02:38:10.731 --> 02:38:13.189
What a blunder.

02:38:14.443 --> 02:38:15.478
Where is she?

02:38:15.653 --> 02:38:18.896
I left her at the guesthouse.
You'll meet her tomorrow.

02:38:19.073 --> 02:38:20.905
She mustn't do too much just now.

02:38:23.786 --> 02:38:25.902
She's carrying your child?

02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:27.115
Yes.

02:38:28.916 --> 02:38:32.250
So, after all,
your name will not die out.

02:38:32.795 --> 02:38:34.877
That's right.

02:38:38.885 --> 02:38:41.126
Mrs. Moore.

02:38:42.555 --> 02:38:44.512
Mrs. Moore!

02:39:10.917 --> 02:39:12.453
<i>And Stella believes...</i>

02:39:12.627 --> 02:39:15.836
<i>...the evil of the Marabar
has been wiped out...</i>

02:39:16.005 --> 02:39:18.372
...and <i>so</i> do I.

02:39:21.594 --> 02:39:25.087
<i>Dear Miss Quested...</i>

02:39:26.807 --> 02:39:29.469
<i>...tonight is the festival of light...</i>

02:39:29.644 --> 02:39:33.308
...and <i>I'm writing this
to ask you to forgive me.</i>

02:39:33.481 --> 02:39:38.817
<i>It has taken all this time for me
to appreciate your courage.</i>

02:39:39.195 --> 02:39:40.856
<i>Because of you...</i>

02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:45.365
<i>...I'm happy here with my children,
instead of in prison.</i>

02:39:45.534 --> 02:39:51.155
<i>And because of you,
I want to do kind actions all round.</i>

02:39:54.335 --> 02:39:58.829
<i>Richard and Stella left this morning.</i>

02:40:27.201 --> 02:40:28.862
Goodbye.

02:41:07.616 --> 02:41:11.075
<i>I do not think
I will ever see them again.</i>
