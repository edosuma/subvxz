WEBVTT

00:04.457 --> 00:05.975
What do you mean
"cause undetermined"?

00:06.136 --> 00:07.685
It's a homicide!

00:07.687 --> 00:09.253
You know what,
the only thing undetermined

00:09.255 --> 00:11.255
is how you even got your job
in the first place.

00:11.257 --> 00:12.590
Yeah, that's right.

00:12.592 --> 00:13.975
Making friends
again, Reagan?

00:13.977 --> 00:15.510
Sarge...
Don't sit down, let's go.

00:15.512 --> 00:17.011
We got a shooting
on 118th and Broadway.

00:17.013 --> 00:18.096
Possible gang related.

00:18.098 --> 00:19.063
So I'm riding with you?

00:19.065 --> 00:20.481
What happened to, uh, Mac?

00:20.483 --> 00:23.467
She's testifying at the Adamo
trial for the next two days.

00:23.469 --> 00:24.969
Why didn't they ask me
to testify?

00:24.971 --> 00:26.521
Well,
it might have something to do

00:26.523 --> 00:28.439
with the defense's claim
that you intimidated a suspect

00:28.441 --> 00:30.575
into making a false confession.

00:30.577 --> 00:31.642
I did?

00:31.644 --> 00:33.411
You need to work on
your social skills.

00:33.413 --> 00:34.862
I do?

00:38.535 --> 00:40.084
Hey, how'd your case go?

00:40.086 --> 00:40.969
We won.

00:40.971 --> 00:42.870
Congratulations.
Thank you.

00:42.872 --> 00:44.822
So, what's your record
so far this year?

00:44.824 --> 00:48.426
Uh, 12 convictions
and one mistrial.

00:48.428 --> 00:50.261
Wow.

00:50.263 --> 00:51.495
What do you think
makes you so good?

00:51.497 --> 00:52.997
Oh, I don't know.

00:52.999 --> 00:54.298
Practice?

00:54.300 --> 00:56.017
Yeah,
I've definitely gotten better

00:56.019 --> 00:57.468
with the more trials I've done.

00:57.470 --> 01:01.472
Sort of like... driving.

01:01.474 --> 01:03.841
You know,
the more you practice,

01:03.843 --> 01:05.810
the better
driver you become.

01:06.862 --> 01:07.862
Okay, Nicky,

01:07.864 --> 01:10.481
I am sorry
that I have not been

01:10.483 --> 01:12.867
practicing with you,
but we have plenty of time.

01:12.869 --> 01:14.185
You keep saying that.

01:14.187 --> 01:15.870
We have more than a month.

01:15.872 --> 01:17.872
No, it's less than that.

01:17.874 --> 01:20.491
Okay, well, isn't your dad
taking you driving this weekend?

01:20.493 --> 01:22.543
No, he's going away now.

01:22.545 --> 01:24.212
Of course he is.

01:24.214 --> 01:25.747
Maybe you just
don't want me to drive.

01:25.749 --> 01:27.865
That is not fair.

01:27.867 --> 01:30.718
No, Mom, what's not fair
is that I'm supposed to take

01:30.720 --> 01:32.837
my driving test and there's
no way I'm going to pass

01:32.839 --> 01:34.222
because you said
that you'd teach me,

01:34.224 --> 01:36.307
and you haven't even
taken me out once.

01:42.347 --> 01:44.148
Tell me that's not
the shooting victim.

01:44.150 --> 01:46.401
Ten years old, Devon Williams.

01:46.403 --> 01:47.969
What's the story?

01:47.971 --> 01:49.737
He has a gunshot wound
to his shoulder.

01:49.739 --> 01:51.039
He's in shock;
lost a lot of blood.

01:51.041 --> 01:52.907
Where you taking him?
St. Vic's.

01:52.909 --> 01:54.058
What about the parents?

01:54.060 --> 01:55.226
The mom's right there.

01:55.228 --> 01:56.611
Ma'am, I'm Detective Reagan.

01:56.613 --> 02:00.198
Look, do you have any idea
who would do this to your boy?

02:00.200 --> 02:02.834
Ma'am, please,
anything you tell us can help.

02:02.836 --> 02:05.369
I can't help your son
unless you help me, all right?

02:05.371 --> 02:06.838
Can you tell me anything?

02:06.840 --> 02:08.723
I don't know.

02:08.725 --> 02:10.842
I don't know.

02:10.844 --> 02:12.176
Hey, get her on the bus,
all right?

02:12.178 --> 02:13.577
Go on.

02:13.579 --> 02:16.097
We'll find out who did this.

02:20.803 --> 02:23.587
Anybody see what happened?

02:23.589 --> 02:25.440
Huh?

02:25.442 --> 02:28.392
Nobody saw nothing, huh?

02:28.394 --> 02:29.444
Hey.

02:29.446 --> 02:31.095
Hey, you.

02:31.097 --> 02:32.596
Come on, a ten-year-old
kid gets shot on the stoop

02:32.598 --> 02:34.115
and nobody saw
it happen?

02:34.117 --> 02:35.700
what about you? Hey.

02:35.702 --> 02:37.535
Get out of my face.
Hey!

02:37.537 --> 02:40.037
Hey, Danny, Danny, Danny,
come on, Danny.

02:41.657 --> 02:44.408
Move on.

02:47.796 --> 02:49.046
Doing okay, Reagan?

02:49.048 --> 02:52.449
Who the hell
shoots a ten-year-old kid?

02:52.451 --> 02:57.054
<i>People say New York</i>
<i>is a tough city.</i>

02:57.056 --> 03:01.292
But it's also a place
where dreams come true.

03:01.294 --> 03:03.127
Our city was built by immigrants

03:03.129 --> 03:04.729
who came here
with nothing more

03:04.731 --> 03:06.647
than a wish for a better life

03:06.649 --> 03:11.802
and a willingness to work hard
to that end.

03:11.804 --> 03:17.158
New York has always embraced
music and culture,

03:17.160 --> 03:19.310
and the musicians here tonight

03:19.312 --> 03:21.696
represent the finest in their
field from all over the world,

03:21.698 --> 03:23.948
so I think
it is entirely appropriate

03:23.950 --> 03:25.833
that the last stop

03:25.835 --> 03:29.837
on their American tour...
is New York City.

03:29.839 --> 03:31.756
Hear, hear!
Welcome.

03:38.830 --> 03:40.831
That was lovely,
Frank, as usual.

03:40.833 --> 03:42.600
Thank you so much
for doing this for me.

03:42.602 --> 03:45.052
Oh, I know better than
to say no to you, Joyce.

03:45.054 --> 03:46.437
Mm, good.

03:46.439 --> 03:48.222
I'll remember that.

03:51.777 --> 03:53.060
How much longer?

03:53.062 --> 03:54.695
Just shake some more hands,
take some photos

03:54.697 --> 03:55.696
and you're out of here.

03:55.698 --> 03:56.697
In minutes.

03:56.699 --> 03:58.533
15, 20 tops.

03:58.535 --> 04:00.484
Ten, and you have a deal.

04:04.656 --> 04:05.806
Excuse me.

04:07.576 --> 04:09.860
I'm Isabelle Nassar.

04:09.862 --> 04:11.212
How do you do?
Frank Reagan.

04:11.214 --> 04:12.880
Yes, I know.

04:12.882 --> 04:14.215
You're the
Commissioner of Police.

04:14.217 --> 04:16.000
Yes.

04:16.002 --> 04:17.385
I enjoyed your solo.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.303
Thank you.

04:19.305 --> 04:22.340
What you've said...
it was beautiful.

04:22.342 --> 04:25.176
Well, thank you very much.

04:25.178 --> 04:27.478
I guess you're going back
to Turkey tomorrow.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.482
I can't go home.

04:32.884 --> 04:35.236
As soon as I set foot
in my country...

04:35.238 --> 04:36.887
I'm going to be killed.

We just received this
from the mayor.

05:31.589 --> 05:34.039
"As you have

"I will defer to you in dealing
with the State Department.

05:38.879 --> 05:40.145
It's all yours, Frank."

05:40.147 --> 05:42.348
Nice.

05:42.350 --> 05:43.682
I'm staying for this.

05:45.102 --> 05:46.051
Let's have her.

05:47.220 --> 05:49.271
Baker.

05:49.273 --> 05:50.489
Don't pick a fight.

05:55.829 --> 05:57.530
Commissioner.

05:57.532 --> 05:59.748
Deputy Secretary
Carmen Castillo, this is...

05:59.750 --> 06:02.368
The reason why I had to take
a 6:00 a.m. flight

06:02.370 --> 06:04.253
this morning from Washington.

06:04.255 --> 06:06.121
I requested a
one-on-one meeting.

06:06.123 --> 06:08.740
Mr. Moore is my
Deputy Commissioner

06:08.742 --> 06:10.543
of Public Information.

06:10.545 --> 06:11.927
The press is all over this.

06:11.929 --> 06:13.078
This is my building.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.515
When we have a meeting
in your office,

06:16.517 --> 06:18.017
you can exclude him.

06:18.019 --> 06:20.636
Well, the press should never
have been informed.

06:20.638 --> 06:22.938
My sources say the story
came out of DC.

06:22.940 --> 06:25.257
Well, there wouldn't be a story

06:25.259 --> 06:27.776
if you had followed proper
protocol, stayed out of it

06:27.778 --> 06:30.229
and contacted
us immediately.

06:30.231 --> 06:32.615
My protocol is to provide
necessary protection

06:32.617 --> 06:34.433
to persons seeking asylum,

06:34.435 --> 06:36.702
then notify the proper agency.

06:40.907 --> 06:42.207
Where is she?

06:42.209 --> 06:43.609
In a safe house.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.943
I'd like to see her.

06:45.996 --> 06:48.780
Isabelle Nassar
cannot ask for asylum,

06:48.782 --> 06:50.949
because she had sex
with an American.

06:52.469 --> 06:54.286
We don't know what she did.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.639
What we do know is she snuck out
of her hotel

06:56.641 --> 06:58.790
to meet with a young American
conductor

06:58.792 --> 07:03.228
and her chaperone reported it to
her family in Turkey.

07:04.097 --> 07:06.398
This is in Turkish.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.933
It's the story of
a 17-year-old girl

07:07.935 --> 07:09.968
who was killed by her father

07:09.970 --> 07:11.820
because she kissed a boy
in public.

07:11.822 --> 07:14.139
Those laws have been changed.

07:14.141 --> 07:15.407
The customs haven't.

07:15.409 --> 07:18.861
That father is
Isabelle Nassar's uncle.

07:18.863 --> 07:21.280
And Isabelle's own father
testified

07:21.282 --> 07:24.650
at the trial that his niece
deserved to die

07:24.652 --> 07:27.453
because
she brought shame on the family.

07:27.455 --> 07:29.505
Her uncle was acquitted.

07:31.341 --> 07:33.659
You're an expert
in, uh, Turkish affairs?

07:33.661 --> 07:34.927
I'm a cop.

07:34.929 --> 07:36.428
I've been a cop all my life.

07:36.430 --> 07:38.664
I know when someone's
telling the truth.

07:38.666 --> 07:43.969
her fear is genuine
and the threat is real.

07:43.971 --> 07:47.056
This woman is the responsibility
of the State Department.

07:47.058 --> 07:49.675
Well, we can both agree on that.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.009
Great.

07:51.011 --> 07:55.180
You turn her over,
and then stay out of it.

07:56.533 --> 07:58.651
Oh, boy.

08:02.188 --> 08:04.206
<i>I was sitting with Devon</i>

08:04.208 --> 08:07.159
and I heard a pop-pop.

08:07.161 --> 08:09.194
I didn't even know what it was
until I saw blood

08:09.196 --> 08:10.462
on Devon's shirt.

08:10.464 --> 08:13.332
I want to move but I
don't have that kind of money.

08:13.334 --> 08:15.534
I mean, that neighborhood,
that building,

08:15.536 --> 08:17.920
there's always drug dealers
hanging around outside.

08:17.922 --> 08:20.506
You believe one of
them was responsible?

08:20.508 --> 08:22.758
All I know is the cops
were there two weeks ago

08:22.760 --> 08:24.343
when they arrested a couple of
them gang bangers,

08:24.345 --> 08:27.262
but I saw one of them this
morning, back on the street.

08:27.264 --> 08:29.231
So you tell me,
how's that work?

08:29.233 --> 08:31.049
Ms. Williams, we're sorry.

08:31.051 --> 08:34.720
Sometimes
these things happen.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.822
But the cops aren't the ones
who shot your boy.

08:36.823 --> 08:38.573
We catch this guy,

08:38.576 --> 08:40.558
he's gonna go away
for a long time.

08:49.235 --> 08:50.869
You know, when I
saw you this morning,

08:50.871 --> 08:53.372
I got the impression
you knew something.

08:55.875 --> 08:59.261
I think you think it's one of
those gang bangers, don't you?

09:02.298 --> 09:03.799
Okay.

09:03.801 --> 09:06.018
So why don't you help us out
and give us a name

09:06.020 --> 09:07.419
so we can find him.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.975
I only know his street name:

09:12.977 --> 09:14.359
Tiny Martinez.

09:14.361 --> 09:16.812
This Tiny Martinez...

09:16.814 --> 09:20.098
you're pretty sure he's
the guy that did it?

09:20.100 --> 09:23.986
All I know is our block
is run by the Saints.

09:23.988 --> 09:25.204
Tiny's in the Double-Treys.

09:25.206 --> 09:27.406
When he started trying
to sell in our building,

09:27.408 --> 09:29.941
the gangs started
hating on each other.

09:29.943 --> 09:33.128
I don't think it's a coincidence
I saw Tiny this morning.

09:33.130 --> 09:35.047
You think he was
looking for revenge?

09:35.049 --> 09:37.666
I don't know what
makes someone fire a gun

09:37.668 --> 09:40.002
into a street
full of people.

09:40.004 --> 09:42.788
Or maybe you don't even need
a reason to fire a gun up here,

09:42.790 --> 09:45.123
'cause there's never any cops
around anyway.

09:54.168 --> 09:55.267
No, no, no, no, no--

09:55.269 --> 09:56.735
remember you look in
your mirror, behind you,

09:56.737 --> 09:58.904
make sure that
nobody's coming,

09:58.906 --> 10:01.356
and then slowly take your foot
off the brake

10:01.358 --> 10:03.325
and gently
put pressure on the gas.

10:05.311 --> 10:07.412
Okay, gently...
I said gently.

10:07.414 --> 10:09.114
Okay, okay, relax.

10:13.086 --> 10:14.486
All right,
you're doing good.

10:14.488 --> 10:16.789
Just make sure you keep
looking in your mirrors.

10:19.509 --> 10:21.093
Okay, what's this guy doing?

10:21.095 --> 10:23.412
There's not even
a passenger in his car.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.513
Give him a minute.

10:24.515 --> 10:26.331
What is he doing?
Come on.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.467
Let's go! Come on!

10:28.469 --> 10:30.669
Mom, what are you doing?

10:30.671 --> 10:31.804
He's probably
texting or something.

10:31.806 --> 10:33.305
Honestly, people need
to pay more attention

10:33.307 --> 10:34.439
when they're driving.

10:34.441 --> 10:36.225
Why don't you
just go around him.

10:38.595 --> 10:39.778
Nicky, you're going too slow.

10:39.780 --> 10:41.346
Get back in you lane.

10:41.348 --> 10:42.848
I'm doing fine.
Just stop it.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.199
You're making me nervous.
No, there's a car coming at you.

10:44.201 --> 10:45.450
You're not doing fine.

10:45.452 --> 10:46.869
Get back
in your lane.

10:51.742 --> 10:53.125
Are you kidding me?

10:53.127 --> 10:54.743
Really? Really?

10:54.745 --> 10:56.378
Mom... relax.

10:56.380 --> 10:59.498
Go around
if you're in such a rush.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.083
Go!

11:03.052 --> 11:04.753
I didn't say to pull over.

11:04.755 --> 11:06.805
You're fine-- just
keep going straight.

11:06.807 --> 11:08.373
You know what? I ca...

11:08.375 --> 11:09.541
Okay, all right. What...

11:09.543 --> 11:11.510
How do you stop this thing?

11:11.512 --> 11:12.845
Stop...

11:12.847 --> 11:13.979
Okay, you're fi...

11:13.981 --> 11:15.764
Mom, would you
just stop?!

11:15.766 --> 11:17.316
I can't do this.

11:17.318 --> 11:19.184
What do you mean you can't do it?
You're doing fine.

11:19.186 --> 11:20.652
I can't drive with you.

11:20.654 --> 11:22.688
You can't drive with me?
What do you mean?

11:22.690 --> 11:24.156
I mean I can't drive with you.

11:24.158 --> 11:25.240
You're just impossible.

11:25.242 --> 11:27.559
Forget it.

11:27.561 --> 11:28.744
Okay.

11:31.531 --> 11:32.865
<i>Guy walking into the park,</i>

11:32.867 --> 11:34.950
orange hoodie--
that's Tiny.

11:34.952 --> 11:37.402
What does Narcotics
know about Tiny?

11:37.404 --> 11:38.737
He's smart.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.839
He's never been caught
with any felony weight.

11:40.841 --> 11:43.675
He's always been able to ditch it;
and he's got a good lawyer.

11:43.677 --> 11:45.294
We've been watching him
for a couple of months now.

11:45.296 --> 11:48.463
He always has one of his
guys make the actual transaction.

11:48.465 --> 11:50.182
Okay, this guy Tiny,
he usually packing?

11:50.184 --> 11:52.467
We have a credible CI
tell us he's carrying

11:52.469 --> 11:54.937
a nine-millimeter on him today.
Same caliber that hit Devon.

11:54.939 --> 11:57.055
Exactly. So what the hell
are we waiting for?

11:57.057 --> 11:59.090
Hold on, Danny.
For all we know,

11:59.092 --> 12:00.759
all these guys
are carrying.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.861
No Lone Ranger
stuff, <i>capisce?</i>

12:02.863 --> 12:05.280
Got it.
No "I" in "team," Sarge.

12:05.282 --> 12:06.315
My team is ready.

12:06.317 --> 12:08.266
Okay. So on three, then?

12:08.268 --> 12:09.117
Let's do it.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.569
Good. Three.

12:12.956 --> 12:13.939
Whoop, whoop!

12:13.941 --> 12:16.375
Hold it!

12:16.377 --> 12:18.427
Move! Police! Hold it!

12:18.429 --> 12:20.379
Police!

12:20.381 --> 12:21.413
Hold it!

12:23.750 --> 12:25.300
Hey!

12:25.302 --> 12:27.536
He dropped the gun!
Get the gun!

12:33.059 --> 12:34.476
Hey!

12:34.478 --> 12:36.378
Hold it!

12:39.732 --> 12:41.717
Come here!

12:42.652 --> 12:44.135
Let me see your hands.

12:44.137 --> 12:46.972
My leg!
Shut up!

12:46.974 --> 12:48.139
I'm hurt, man.

12:48.141 --> 12:49.908
He threw me
down the stairs, sir.

12:49.910 --> 12:51.526
I didn't throw him
down the stairs, Sergeant.

12:51.528 --> 12:52.744
Oh, my leg, man!

12:52.746 --> 12:54.112
Shut up!

12:54.114 --> 12:55.914
Call for a bus.

12:55.916 --> 12:57.616
Oh, my leg! It hurts, man!

12:57.618 --> 12:59.534
I didn't throw him
down the stairs.

12:59.536 --> 13:02.287
Believe me, if I did,
I'd tell you.

13:04.874 --> 13:07.259
I should have never
left the hotel.

13:07.261 --> 13:09.294
I'm sorry
about all this.

13:09.296 --> 13:13.298
I didn't mean to put you
in a difficult situation.

13:13.300 --> 13:16.802
Don't worry about me--
I got pretty broad shoulders.

13:18.638 --> 13:22.357
I approached you because
I could see you were a good man.

13:22.359 --> 13:24.359
You could have pushed me off

13:24.361 --> 13:26.395
onto someone else,
but you didn't.

13:26.397 --> 13:28.346
No, I didn't.

13:30.216 --> 13:31.984
How you holding up?

13:31.986 --> 13:35.988
That woman
from the State Department...

13:35.990 --> 13:39.691
kept asking me for...

13:39.693 --> 13:41.827
proof...

13:41.829 --> 13:44.029
evidence, witnesses

13:44.031 --> 13:46.631
to support my claims.

13:46.633 --> 13:49.301
I don't have
any of those things.

13:50.186 --> 13:52.220
I just...

13:52.222 --> 13:55.007
know my father.

13:57.343 --> 13:59.761
He is a man of...

13:59.763 --> 14:02.647
great faith...

14:02.649 --> 14:07.552
and protecting the family name
is more important to him

14:07.554 --> 14:09.571
than anything.

14:09.573 --> 14:12.107
Well, I'm a man of faith...

14:13.776 --> 14:16.078
...and I can't imagine
anything more important

14:16.080 --> 14:18.497
than protecting my kids.

14:18.499 --> 14:20.615
I brought shame.

14:22.201 --> 14:23.902
And in my family...

14:23.904 --> 14:25.871
that is unforgivable.

14:25.873 --> 14:29.908
I don't expect you
to understand.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.177
I don't understand.

14:32.179 --> 14:34.379
But I believe you.

14:40.436 --> 14:43.188
Isabelle...

14:43.190 --> 14:47.275
this decision will ultimately
rest with the State Department,

14:47.277 --> 14:49.361
but I promise you...

14:49.363 --> 14:53.982
I will do everything I can
to keep you safe.

15:02.825 --> 15:04.076
Hey, hold on.

15:04.078 --> 15:05.293
Hold on.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.079
Hold on a second, guys.
Hey.

15:07.081 --> 15:09.331
I want to show
you something.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.216
This look familiar?

15:11.218 --> 15:13.502
I think you dropped it
on your little run.

15:13.504 --> 15:15.921
If you say so, man.
Look, I don't care what you did.

15:15.923 --> 15:17.956
I don't even care
what you plan on doing.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.242
All I care about is finding out
who shot Devon Williams.

15:20.244 --> 15:22.010
I don't know.
You're gonna

15:22.012 --> 15:23.979
lie to me?
Just like you're lying

15:23.981 --> 15:25.397
about your little injury here?

15:25.399 --> 15:28.433
Just you lying about giving
a crap what happens here?

15:28.435 --> 15:30.936
I'm gonna ask you one more time:
Who the hell shot that kid?

15:30.938 --> 15:32.070
Off him, Detective.

15:32.072 --> 15:34.139
Come on! Get him
out of here!

15:38.161 --> 15:40.028
Sarge, I know what you're
gonna say, all right?

15:40.030 --> 15:41.530
No, you have no idea
what I'm gonna say.

15:41.532 --> 15:43.398
He's a scumbag, and he's lying.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.367
And the patrol guide
doesn't make exceptions

15:45.369 --> 15:46.701
for scumbags like him.

15:46.703 --> 15:48.170
Come on, we got
a ten-year-old kid

15:48.172 --> 15:50.038
lying in a hospital bed
and he knows something!

15:50.040 --> 15:51.957
And on top of that,
I got a Narcotics sergeant

15:51.959 --> 15:53.175
telling me I can't
control my guys.

15:53.177 --> 15:55.624
And a hothead like
you puts his guys in danger.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.430
Look, that guy got
what he deserved, okay?

15:57.431 --> 16:00.048
Last week you got into it
with IA; week before that,

16:00.050 --> 16:01.800
it was Adamo's
defense attorney;

16:01.802 --> 16:03.635
this morning it was
the M.E.'s Office; and now this.

16:03.637 --> 16:06.521
Now what?!
I'm doing my job here, Sarge!

16:06.523 --> 16:08.023
You know what,
you just bought yourself

16:08.025 --> 16:10.392
some sensitivity training,
starting tomorrow!

16:11.227 --> 16:13.695
I need to work this case.

16:13.697 --> 16:15.780
You know what you need to work?

16:15.782 --> 16:18.533
Your freakin' anger management.

16:33.761 --> 16:37.147
See, I was going to give
this guy a summons, right?

16:37.149 --> 16:39.566
Then he starts
with the attitude.

16:39.568 --> 16:41.051
So I arrested him.

16:41.053 --> 16:43.737
You know, I-I'm just...
really tired of going

16:43.739 --> 16:45.889
into neighborhoods
trying to help people

16:45.891 --> 16:47.574
and getting treated
like I'm the enemy.

16:47.576 --> 16:51.494
And is the answer to treat the
people who live there like the enemy?

16:51.496 --> 16:53.363
No.

16:53.365 --> 16:55.832
Maybe if he knew why you were there,
in the neighborhood,

16:55.834 --> 16:57.784
he might support
what you're trying to do.

16:57.786 --> 17:00.370
Or maybe he just might try
to blow your brains out.

17:01.707 --> 17:02.906
We don't...

17:02.908 --> 17:04.840
we don't interrupt
like that... here.

17:04.843 --> 17:07.210
Oh. Forgive me.

17:07.212 --> 17:09.296
Our responsibility
as cops

17:09.298 --> 17:11.247
is to...

17:11.249 --> 17:12.582
Yes?

17:12.584 --> 17:15.084
Yeah, uh, are you a cop?

17:15.803 --> 17:17.587
I was speaking for the group.

17:17.589 --> 17:18.771
Oh, right.

17:18.773 --> 17:20.973
It is our
responsibility

17:20.976 --> 17:24.227
to try to understand the culture
of the communities we work in.

17:24.229 --> 17:25.362
What about when it's the culture

17:25.364 --> 17:26.863
of the community
to hate the police?

17:26.865 --> 17:28.648
Yeah.
I mean,

17:28.650 --> 17:30.533
how many of you
have been spit at?

17:30.535 --> 17:32.936
Yeah.
Or cursed at?

17:32.938 --> 17:34.070
Or how about
getting pegged

17:34.072 --> 17:35.906
with garbage?

17:35.908 --> 17:38.458
Then your job is
to try and change that.

17:40.245 --> 17:41.294
Mm-hmm?

17:41.296 --> 17:44.280
Yeah, how do you propose
we change that, Doc?

17:44.282 --> 17:46.333
Maybe, uh, the cops

17:46.335 --> 17:47.801
and gangbangers all get together

17:47.803 --> 17:51.087
and hold hands and sing songs
in the streets or something?

17:53.842 --> 17:55.508
It doesn't really work that way.

17:55.510 --> 17:58.561
But... then again, you
wouldn't know that, would you,

17:58.563 --> 18:00.647
because... you're not a cop.

18:00.649 --> 18:02.966
Detective Reagan, is there something
you want to contribute,

18:02.968 --> 18:04.484
besides some levity?

18:05.770 --> 18:07.136
No.

18:07.138 --> 18:09.072
Why don't you tell us
what gets under your skin.

18:09.074 --> 18:10.941
Hmm...

18:10.943 --> 18:12.409
Not much.

18:12.411 --> 18:14.744
Something that makes you
feel stressed.

18:14.746 --> 18:18.665
No, I don't feel any stress.

18:18.667 --> 18:19.699
You're a major-case detective--

18:19.701 --> 18:21.418
you have the most
stressful job there is.

18:21.420 --> 18:22.919
You're damn right.

18:22.921 --> 18:26.089
Why don't you tell us
why you're here.

18:26.091 --> 18:28.992
I have no idea why I'm here.

18:28.994 --> 18:32.829
Okay. You can start by sharing
why you're angry.

18:32.831 --> 18:34.180
I told you I'm not angry.

18:34.182 --> 18:35.598
If you don't learn
how to control your anger,

18:35.600 --> 18:37.017
your anger will control you.

18:37.019 --> 18:39.803
Put it on a bumper sticker, Doc.

18:39.805 --> 18:43.006
So, you're angry because...
you don't want to be here?

18:43.008 --> 18:44.357
I'm not angry.

18:44.359 --> 18:46.009
I'm frustrated.

18:46.011 --> 18:47.560
Because the fact is,

18:47.562 --> 18:49.345
I shouldn't be here;
I should be out trying

18:49.347 --> 18:50.897
to solve the case
of a ten-year-old kid

18:50.899 --> 18:52.782
who was shot
in front of his own home.

18:52.784 --> 18:54.851
But instead,
I got to sit around here

18:54.853 --> 18:57.487
talking about my feelings
in a circle with you,

18:57.489 --> 18:59.139
a guy who's never
spent five minutes

18:59.141 --> 19:01.491
on the job, but yet, somehow,
you think you're qualified

19:01.493 --> 19:03.743
to tell us
how we should do ours!

19:03.745 --> 19:05.862
At least you're not angry.

19:08.082 --> 19:11.418
<i>The Turkish government</i>

19:11.420 --> 19:14.037
is demanding
that she be sent back.

19:14.039 --> 19:16.589
Turkey has a
strategic geographic

19:16.591 --> 19:18.008
significance for us.

19:18.010 --> 19:20.477
And the State Department cannot
afford to strain relations

19:20.479 --> 19:22.012
with them at this time.

19:22.014 --> 19:24.230
We're talking
about someone's life here.

19:24.232 --> 19:26.049
Turkish law was amended,
Commissioner.

19:26.051 --> 19:28.318
They now allow
for stiffer prison sentences

19:28.320 --> 19:30.537
for men who kill

19:30.539 --> 19:32.772
their female relatives
for transgressions.

19:32.774 --> 19:36.109
Honor killings have increased
tenfold in the last six years.

19:36.111 --> 19:39.662
Those laws were only changed
to placate a UN sanction.

19:39.664 --> 19:41.664
The State Department
isn't in the business

19:41.666 --> 19:44.117
of interpreting other countries'
laws and customs.

19:44.119 --> 19:45.752
Well, shouldn't you be
in the business

19:45.754 --> 19:47.904
of protecting a woman
whose life is in danger?

19:47.906 --> 19:50.006
We have no
proof of that.

19:50.008 --> 19:53.376
So far, the news story
is limited to the affair

19:53.378 --> 19:56.429
and her desire to stay here.

19:56.431 --> 19:59.849
It's in everyone's best interest
if it just stays that way.

19:59.851 --> 20:01.885
Except hers.

20:03.888 --> 20:06.189
After seeing her...

20:06.191 --> 20:08.257
I agree with you.

20:08.259 --> 20:10.360
Her fear is real.

20:10.362 --> 20:12.779
But what happens
when she goes back...

20:12.781 --> 20:14.597
is unknowable.

20:14.599 --> 20:17.117
I'm not asking you
to rewrite policy;

20:17.119 --> 20:19.769
I'm asking you to safe a life.

20:19.771 --> 20:22.405
I only wish I could.

20:22.407 --> 20:24.440
I'm scheduling
a press conference

20:24.442 --> 20:26.126
for later this afternoon.

20:26.128 --> 20:28.711
I expect you to be there
standing behind me...

20:28.713 --> 20:30.914
in support.

20:51.301 --> 20:53.570
♪

21:05.482 --> 21:08.868
Absolutely amazing
the damage this thing can do.

21:08.870 --> 21:10.787
This little piece
of hardware here

21:10.789 --> 21:13.173
is gonna cost you
25 years to life

21:13.175 --> 21:16.176
if ballistics match the bullet
that hit Devon Williams.

21:16.178 --> 21:17.677
I didn't shoot Devon.

21:17.679 --> 21:18.711
Who did?

21:19.880 --> 21:22.465
Come on, tough guy,
he said, "Who did?"

21:23.467 --> 21:24.434
Danny...

21:25.519 --> 21:27.770
Does this have something to do
with Saints territory?

21:27.772 --> 21:29.305
You don't know what
you're talking about.

21:29.307 --> 21:31.674
Yeah, I do.
Is it a turf war or not?

21:31.676 --> 21:33.026
It's getting
a little hot in here--

21:33.028 --> 21:35.028
you think you can, uh,
do something about that?

21:37.849 --> 21:42.318
Look, ordinarily, a smart-ass crack
like that would really piss me off,

21:42.320 --> 21:45.021
but as you can see,
I'm not angry, right?

21:45.023 --> 21:47.006
Mm.
Right.

21:47.008 --> 21:48.291
But I do want you
to know something.

21:48.293 --> 21:50.410
I know where you deal
and I know where you live,

21:50.412 --> 21:52.462
in fact, I even know where
your girlfriend lives,

21:52.464 --> 21:54.631
and I'm gonna be shadowing
you everywhere you go.

21:54.633 --> 21:56.032
And when I get the chance,

21:56.034 --> 21:57.967
I'm gonna lock you up,
and I don't give a damn

21:57.969 --> 21:59.836
if the charges stick or not,
I'm just gonna

21:59.838 --> 22:01.921
lock you up again and
again and again and again!

22:01.923 --> 22:03.556
Until you cooperate.

22:04.542 --> 22:06.342
You a crazy dude, huh?

22:10.514 --> 22:11.681
I didn't even do nothing, man.

22:11.683 --> 22:13.016
Yeah.

22:13.018 --> 22:14.383
But you know something,

22:14.385 --> 22:16.519
and that's just as bad.

22:16.521 --> 22:17.887
Okay, you live at

22:17.889 --> 22:19.906
26291 East...

22:19.908 --> 22:21.658
A'ight, man, a'ight.

22:21.660 --> 22:23.443
I'll talk deal,
but not with him.

22:23.445 --> 22:25.578
Get me somebody
from the DA's Office.

22:26.780 --> 22:27.897
All right.

22:27.899 --> 22:29.866
Yeah.

22:30.668 --> 22:32.168
<i>In the DA's Office,</i>

22:32.170 --> 22:35.238
we call it "refugee roulette."

22:35.240 --> 22:36.906
The asylum outcome

22:36.908 --> 22:38.341
depends on the
immigration judge

22:38.343 --> 22:39.842
that has been
assigned to the case.

22:39.844 --> 22:42.845
I think the Deputy Secretary
is sympathetic.

22:42.847 --> 22:44.347
You're telling me
it's out of her hands.

22:44.349 --> 22:46.182
Without any new evidence,

22:46.184 --> 22:49.552
if the judge has signed off
on it, it's a done deal.

22:51.605 --> 22:52.939
You want a drink?

22:52.941 --> 22:54.691
No.

22:54.693 --> 22:56.592
So, it's probably
not a good time

22:56.594 --> 22:58.761
to ask for some advice.

22:59.647 --> 23:01.981
No, it's a good time. What?

23:01.983 --> 23:04.150
I promised Nicky
that I would

23:04.152 --> 23:05.568
teach her how to drive,

23:05.570 --> 23:07.487
but then I got
busy and forgot,

23:07.489 --> 23:09.789
and the test is less
than a month away.

23:09.791 --> 23:12.441
I gave her her first lesson.

23:12.443 --> 23:13.710
How'd it go?

23:13.712 --> 23:15.378
It was a disaster.

23:15.380 --> 23:17.046
She thinks that
I'm a terrible driver.

23:17.048 --> 23:18.447
Well, you are.

23:18.449 --> 23:20.283
No, I'm not.

23:20.285 --> 23:22.285
I'm a very careful
and skilled...

23:22.287 --> 23:23.303
Litigator.

23:23.305 --> 23:24.754
As for driving, you have

23:24.756 --> 23:26.923
no patience,
you yell at other drivers

23:26.925 --> 23:28.091
like they can hear you,

23:28.093 --> 23:29.726
you use the horn liberally...

23:29.728 --> 23:32.228
Well, that's what
it's there for, to warn people.

23:32.230 --> 23:33.263
That Erin's coming?

23:33.265 --> 23:34.731
That's funny.

23:34.733 --> 23:36.683
I'm not a terrible driver.

23:36.685 --> 23:37.817
Don't feel bad.

23:39.237 --> 23:40.970
None of the Reagans can drive.

23:40.972 --> 23:42.689
I haven't driven in five years.

23:42.691 --> 23:44.023
Pop gave up his license.

23:44.025 --> 23:45.491
Danny can drive...

23:45.493 --> 23:46.659
Oh.
...but only at

23:46.661 --> 23:48.111
100 miles an hour.

23:48.113 --> 23:50.680
Actually, there is one Reagan
who can drive.

23:50.682 --> 23:51.748
e patient one.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.032
Jamie.

23:53.034 --> 23:55.034
He went back and forth
from Harvard all the time.

23:55.036 --> 23:56.502
Without incident.

23:56.504 --> 23:57.787
Oh, I got to go.

23:57.789 --> 23:58.838
What?

23:58.840 --> 23:59.789
I'm late for a plea bargain.

23:59.791 --> 24:01.291
Bye.

24:06.013 --> 24:08.381
Even if ballistics
don't match

24:08.383 --> 24:09.966
the bullet that hit Devon,

24:09.968 --> 24:11.167
with your record,

24:11.169 --> 24:12.885
I can get you
in for five,

24:12.887 --> 24:14.837
for possession of
an illegal firearm.

24:14.839 --> 24:15.972
No way.

24:15.974 --> 24:17.874
In your last
court appearance,

24:17.876 --> 24:21.694
you used Alan Zuckerman
as your attorney of record.

24:21.696 --> 24:25.948
That must put you back,
what, 400 an hour?

24:25.950 --> 24:29.485
But he is one of the best
defense attorneys I know.

24:29.487 --> 24:31.154
You should call him,

24:31.156 --> 24:33.790
ask him if Erin Reagan can
get you a five-year sentence

24:33.792 --> 24:34.991
for possession.

24:34.993 --> 24:36.659
He'll tell you.

24:36.661 --> 24:38.995
And then we can talk.

24:38.997 --> 24:40.863
Hold up.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.866
What you offering?

24:43.868 --> 24:45.418
It depends on what you've got.

24:45.420 --> 24:46.969
Like something substantial
enough to break open

24:46.971 --> 24:48.588
the Devon Williams case, maybe.

24:48.590 --> 24:50.340
Then I'll reduce
your felony

24:50.342 --> 24:52.091
to a misdemeanor,
recommend a year.

24:52.093 --> 24:53.976
No. No time.

24:53.978 --> 24:55.311
One year community service,

24:55.313 --> 24:56.679
three year probation.

24:56.681 --> 24:59.098
One year probation,
no community service.

25:00.601 --> 25:02.068
Yes, community service.

25:02.070 --> 25:04.604
Three year probation;
it's mandatory.

25:04.606 --> 25:06.856
No more negotiations,
you take it or leave it.

25:10.911 --> 25:13.079
The Devon shooting was a hit.

25:13.081 --> 25:14.730
A hit?

25:14.732 --> 25:17.583
Who'd put out a hit
on a ten-year-old kid?

25:17.585 --> 25:19.001
Word is Devon wasn't the target.

25:19.003 --> 25:20.069
So who was?

25:20.071 --> 25:21.337
One of your gangbanging
buddies, what?

25:21.339 --> 25:24.207
His mother-- Letitia.

25:30.881 --> 25:32.632
Isabelle Nassar,
the Turkish national

25:32.634 --> 25:34.884
who requested
permanent residence

25:34.886 --> 25:36.519
while on a stop
here in New York

25:36.521 --> 25:38.604
during a musical
tour of the U.S.,

25:38.606 --> 25:41.391
has been found ineligible for
asylum in the United States,

25:41.393 --> 25:44.861
in accordance
with the Refugee Act of 1980,

25:44.863 --> 25:47.697
which regulates asylum policy.

25:47.699 --> 25:49.365
This decision fr
the State Department

25:49.367 --> 25:51.234
has been finalized by
an immigration judge

25:51.236 --> 25:56.155
and removal procedures
will begin immediately.

26:12.164 --> 26:14.615
I've been thinking about
this whole driving thing.

26:14.617 --> 26:15.966
Forget it.

26:15.968 --> 26:17.585
I take the subway
everywhere I go, anyway.

26:17.587 --> 26:19.720
It's not like I really
need my license.

26:19.722 --> 26:21.288
No, everyone should
have a license,

26:21.290 --> 26:23.841
and I'm sorry I didn't spend
more time teaching you.

26:23.843 --> 26:25.559
It's really no big deal.

26:25.561 --> 26:30.397
But I've decided
I'm not going to teach you.

26:30.399 --> 26:31.849
I think it
would be better

26:31.851 --> 26:34.468
if Jamie showed you
how to drive.

26:35.471 --> 26:36.637
Really?

26:36.639 --> 26:39.473
Okay, you don't need
to look so excited.

26:39.475 --> 26:41.642
Oh, I mean, sorry, I...

26:41.644 --> 26:44.528
I'm just happy to have
some extra driving time.

26:44.530 --> 26:46.280
Okay, you can talk to him

26:46.282 --> 26:47.781
about when you're
free for...

26:50.252 --> 26:52.152
...for lessons.

26:52.154 --> 26:54.505
And I am a good driver.

26:55.624 --> 26:57.258
I am.

26:57.260 --> 26:59.159
Behind enemy lines in a tank,

26:59.161 --> 27:01.178
for sure I'd want you to be
the one behind the wheel.

27:01.180 --> 27:03.964
Ha, ha, ha.

27:03.966 --> 27:06.884
The stress manifests
itself in many ways,

27:06.886 --> 27:10.638
whether it's drinking or
flying off the handle

27:10.640 --> 27:12.506
at our loved ones,

27:12.508 --> 27:13.674
taking our anger out on them--

27:13.676 --> 27:17.844
bottom line,
we all need ways to decompress.

27:17.846 --> 27:21.682
So, let's go around and share
our coping mechanisms.

27:24.552 --> 27:27.988
We'll start with you,
Detective Reagan.

27:27.990 --> 27:32.693
I don't really have any
mechanisms, Doc, I just cope.

27:32.695 --> 27:34.411
So what do you do
with all your anger?

27:34.413 --> 27:37.214
Why is anger such a problem?

27:37.216 --> 27:38.966
I mean, seriously,
when did anger

27:38.968 --> 27:40.668
become such a bad thing
in this world?

27:40.670 --> 27:42.886
Anger is not a problem;
it's what you do with it.

27:42.888 --> 27:44.004
Oh.

27:44.006 --> 27:45.139
Now, you've never
roughed someone up

27:45.141 --> 27:46.873
because you think
they have information

27:46.875 --> 27:48.759
to help you close a case?

27:48.761 --> 27:51.044
You never had to be pulled

27:51.046 --> 27:53.647
off a perp to stop you
from doing some real damage?

27:53.649 --> 27:56.233
You know, sometimes,
we do what we got to do

27:56.235 --> 27:57.768
to get the job done.

27:59.437 --> 28:03.157
You ever lose your temper
with your wife or your kids?

28:03.159 --> 28:04.274
Don't bring my family into this.

28:04.276 --> 28:05.693
I would love to
leave everyone's

28:05.695 --> 28:07.578
family out of this.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.246
But the truth is
they live this job

28:09.248 --> 28:10.781
almost as much as you do.

28:10.783 --> 28:12.950
Because you can tell me

28:12.952 --> 28:15.285
all you want how much
you don't get angry,

28:15.287 --> 28:17.070
or don't bring the
job home with you,

28:17.072 --> 28:19.573
but you're lying to
yourself if you believe that.

28:19.575 --> 28:20.624
Hey, let me tell you something.

28:20.626 --> 28:21.759
You'd be angry, too,

28:21.761 --> 28:24.261
if you had to see the stuff
we saw every day.

28:24.263 --> 28:25.963
And I'll tell you
something else.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.966
If I ever got killed, murdered,

28:28.968 --> 28:31.101
like an animal in the street,

28:31.103 --> 28:32.186
I hope the detective
investigating

28:32.188 --> 28:33.687
is mad as hell, too.

28:33.689 --> 28:35.389
You know why?

28:35.391 --> 28:37.524
'Cause that's the guy
who's gonna stay up at night,

28:37.526 --> 28:39.760
sleepless, wondering
if he missed something.

28:39.762 --> 28:42.429
That's the guy who's gonna
eat, drink and sleep the case

28:42.431 --> 28:43.930
until it's solved.

28:44.816 --> 28:47.234
You know how I know that?

28:47.236 --> 28:49.119
'Cause I'm that guy.

28:50.822 --> 28:52.322
I do what I gotta do.

28:52.324 --> 28:53.624
Okay, Doc?

28:53.626 --> 28:54.742
Okay.

28:54.744 --> 28:56.410
As long as you understand

28:56.412 --> 28:58.879
that I have been sitting
in this chair long enough

28:58.881 --> 29:02.883
to know that, eventually,
that's also the guy that breaks.

29:02.885 --> 29:06.336
The guy that ends up
back here, in front of me,

29:06.338 --> 29:09.089
wondering how his
life fell apart.

29:17.415 --> 29:18.932
Sorry to have
to ask you this,

29:18.934 --> 29:20.517
but do you have
any involvement

29:20.519 --> 29:22.269
in drugs in any way?

29:22.271 --> 29:23.404
No.

29:23.406 --> 29:24.605
Are you involved

29:24.607 --> 29:25.972
with anyone else who might be?

29:25.974 --> 29:27.775
What's this about?
I told you those gangbangers

29:27.777 --> 29:29.993
were fighting about drugs;
I got nothing to do with that.

29:29.995 --> 29:31.829
We know you told us that,
but we also have reason

29:31.831 --> 29:33.947
to believe that the bullet
that hit your son Devon

29:33.949 --> 29:35.582
was actually intended for you.

29:36.501 --> 29:38.035
For me?

29:38.037 --> 29:40.370
Who'd want me dead?

29:40.372 --> 29:41.672
Is there an ex-boyfriend

29:41.674 --> 29:43.507
or an ex-husband in the picture?

29:43.509 --> 29:44.675
All right, hold...

29:44.677 --> 29:46.460
Devon was shot because of me?

29:46.462 --> 29:47.878
What about Devon's father?

29:47.880 --> 29:49.546
What's your relationship
like with him?

29:49.548 --> 29:52.633
He, um, he was angry
he lost custody,

29:52.635 --> 29:55.052
but I don't need to worry
about him; he's in prison.

29:55.054 --> 29:55.969
He's in prison?

29:55.971 --> 29:57.337
Yeah.
For what?

29:57.339 --> 29:59.189
He got drunk one night,
got into a bar fight

29:59.191 --> 30:00.557
with some guy, guy hit his head.

30:00.559 --> 30:03.444
Darryl got charged
with manslaughter.

30:03.446 --> 30:05.863
Uh-huh.
And you filed for divorce

30:05.865 --> 30:06.897
since he's been locked up?

30:06.899 --> 30:08.866
That drove him crazy.

30:08.868 --> 30:10.451
That, and the fact that

30:10.453 --> 30:12.286
I wasn't bringing Devon
up there to see his daddy

30:12.288 --> 30:13.487
behind bars.

30:13.489 --> 30:15.205
But I'll tell you
something, Detective--

30:15.207 --> 30:16.323
I'll be the one behind bars

30:16.325 --> 30:18.041
if anything else
happens to Devon,

30:18.043 --> 30:21.161
'cause I will kill
whoever's responsible.

30:31.389 --> 30:32.923
Pass the potatoes--
not the healthy ones.

30:32.925 --> 30:34.925
You can have mine;
I'm saving room for dessert.

30:34.927 --> 30:37.728
So, do you want to talk
about how your group is going?

30:41.549 --> 30:42.649
What group?

30:42.651 --> 30:44.434
Don't listen to her.

30:44.436 --> 30:46.403
Danny's C.O.
is having him go

30:46.405 --> 30:47.721
to anger management.

30:47.723 --> 30:49.439
Seriously?

30:49.441 --> 30:50.390
Really!

30:51.726 --> 30:53.193
- Anger what?
- They teach you

30:53.195 --> 30:54.561
how not to get mad.

30:54.563 --> 30:56.163
But Dad doesn't get mad.

30:56.165 --> 30:57.247
He gets even.

30:57.249 --> 30:58.999
Change the subject, please.

30:59.001 --> 31:01.034
Listen, this is
your group here, too.

31:01.036 --> 31:02.419
Mm-hmm.
You know, this is

31:02.421 --> 31:04.671
your numero uno,
and you should maybe hear

31:04.673 --> 31:06.039
what they have to say, too.

31:06.041 --> 31:07.407
You know, Danny,

31:07.409 --> 31:09.259
come to think of it,
I've never

31:09.261 --> 31:12.212
seen you lose your temper
with Linda or the kids.

31:12.214 --> 31:14.047
No, I do.
No, you don't, Dad,

31:14.049 --> 31:15.265
You never yell.

31:15.267 --> 31:16.850
Yeah, well, I-I really do.

31:16.852 --> 31:18.218
I've actually

31:18.220 --> 31:20.971
never seen you get mad
at your family.

31:20.973 --> 31:22.773
Only your siblings.

31:22.775 --> 31:24.274
Well, Sis,

31:24.276 --> 31:25.859
you know, if I've lost
my temper with you,

31:25.861 --> 31:27.444
you probably deserved it.

31:27.446 --> 31:28.612
Whoo...!

31:28.614 --> 31:31.031
And you, too,
you buttinsky.

31:32.535 --> 31:34.201
Now, can we change
the subject, please?

31:34.203 --> 31:35.786
Thank you.

31:35.788 --> 31:37.237
Uh...

31:37.239 --> 31:38.405
Grandpa, I watched

31:38.407 --> 31:39.656
that press conference.

31:39.658 --> 31:40.958
I can't believe
you didn't say anything.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.292
The decision is final.

31:42.294 --> 31:43.610
So they're just
gonna send her back

31:43.612 --> 31:45.946
where she might get killed
because she went on a date?

31:45.948 --> 31:47.548
It's not as simple as that.

31:47.550 --> 31:49.633
Why not?
It's not his call.

31:49.635 --> 31:52.219
Yeah, well, I've never
seen that stop you before.

31:55.289 --> 31:57.290
The law is very clear.

31:57.292 --> 31:59.893
To grant asylum,
the petitioner must prove

31:59.895 --> 32:01.845
that their life is
in imminent danger.

32:01.847 --> 32:03.564
But her life is in danger.

32:03.566 --> 32:04.765
She needs proof.

32:04.767 --> 32:06.567
History isn't proof enough?

32:06.569 --> 32:08.301
No.

32:08.303 --> 32:10.153
But it looked like you agreed
with that lady.

32:10.155 --> 32:12.973
Well, that's what it was
supposed to look like.

32:12.975 --> 32:14.741
But why?
Because there is

32:14.743 --> 32:16.944
a chain of command,
and in this matter

32:16.946 --> 32:19.496
the State Department
is at the top.

32:19.498 --> 32:20.497
It's not fair.

32:20.499 --> 32:22.115
Nicky, I can't tell you

32:22.117 --> 32:24.918
how many times I've had
to stand behind the mayor

32:24.920 --> 32:26.152
and keep my mouth shut.

32:26.154 --> 32:27.921
Sometimes, that's the job.

32:27.923 --> 32:29.172
Grandpa, you have
to do something.

32:29.174 --> 32:31.041
I mean, this woman could die.

32:31.043 --> 32:33.961
I know you--
y-you never give up.

32:37.098 --> 32:39.266
Doesn't that make you angry?

32:39.268 --> 32:41.268
Yes, it does.

32:53.147 --> 32:54.347
<i>Okay.</i>

32:54.349 --> 32:55.532
All right, thank you.

32:55.534 --> 32:58.018
Ready to take a ride?

32:58.020 --> 32:59.369
We're not taking a road trip.

32:59.371 --> 33:00.687
What are you talking about?

33:00.689 --> 33:02.322
He was released a week ago.

33:02.324 --> 33:03.857
Devon's father
was released from prison?

33:03.859 --> 33:05.191
Why wasn't it in the system?

33:05.193 --> 33:06.627
A bureaucratic oversight.

33:06.629 --> 33:07.744
Now, that's a shocker.

33:07.746 --> 33:09.413
Great. Reagan.

33:09.415 --> 33:10.964
What?

33:10.966 --> 33:12.132
Where?

33:12.134 --> 33:13.717
All right.

33:13.719 --> 33:15.136
Devon's father
just snatched him up

33:15.137 --> 33:17.420
from the hospital.

33:30.155 --> 33:31.087
What else, Sarge?

33:31.088 --> 33:32.420
I talked to his P.O.

33:32.422 --> 33:33.821
The address he gave us
is vacant.

33:33.823 --> 33:35.707
Okay, but does he have
any other family

33:35.709 --> 33:37.709
besides his ex-wife in the area?

33:37.711 --> 33:39.594
His father died when he was in
prison, but he owned a bungalow

33:39.596 --> 33:41.463
on Candlewood Lake
in Connecticut.

33:42.831 --> 33:43.848
Candlewood Lake in Connecticut.

33:43.850 --> 33:45.833
That seems like a good place
to lay low.

33:45.835 --> 33:47.835
Yep.
If he was gonna rent a car,

33:47.837 --> 33:49.938
he'd need a credit card and
a license, right? So that's out.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.639
Uh, there's a train
to Danbury,

33:51.641 --> 33:53.475
but that don't leave
till 2:00 p.m.

33:53.477 --> 33:55.276
I'm checking buses right now.

33:56.346 --> 33:57.645
Next bus for Danbury

33:57.647 --> 33:59.197
leaves in 20 minutes, Sarge.

33:59.199 --> 34:01.366
Let's go.

34:08.690 --> 34:10.324
Now, that's good.

34:10.327 --> 34:12.327
Thank you.
Doesn't taste like

34:12.329 --> 34:14.529
they burnt the beans,
like so much of the coffee

34:14.531 --> 34:15.964
you get in the city these days.

34:15.966 --> 34:17.665
I'm glad you like it.

34:17.667 --> 34:19.000
Mmm, mmm.

34:19.002 --> 34:20.585
In my experience,

34:20.587 --> 34:23.505
guys who don't like small talk
are generally bad at making...

34:23.507 --> 34:25.724
Small talk.
Yes.

34:27.059 --> 34:29.893
Can't get nothing past you.
Never could.

34:29.896 --> 34:32.112
I saw the press conference.

34:37.719 --> 34:41.272
Frank, what can I do for you?

34:41.274 --> 34:43.056
Isabelle Nassar.

34:43.059 --> 34:45.110
What about her?
I want to know

34:45.112 --> 34:46.494
what you think of her--

34:46.496 --> 34:49.496
her character, her talent,
her potential.

34:49.498 --> 34:52.751
Unvarnished,
stays right in this room.

35:16.442 --> 35:18.343
Stop!

35:18.345 --> 35:20.111
Police! Hold it!

35:21.147 --> 35:22.730
Hey!

35:22.732 --> 35:24.315
Hey!

35:24.317 --> 35:25.583
Stop this bus!

35:27.320 --> 35:29.937
Stop the bus!

35:31.474 --> 35:33.408
Open the door!

35:33.410 --> 35:35.043
Come on!

35:35.944 --> 35:37.612
Police.

35:39.081 --> 35:42.167
Everybody stay seated,
be calm.

35:42.751 --> 35:44.135
Stand back!

35:45.639 --> 35:47.305
Take it easy.

35:47.307 --> 35:49.557
Just take it easy, all right?

35:49.559 --> 35:53.144
Why don't you put
that gun down, Darryl, okay?

35:53.146 --> 35:54.345
You put your gun down first!

35:54.347 --> 35:57.348
- I can't do that.
- Go.

35:57.350 --> 35:59.350
I swear, I'll use it. I will.

35:59.352 --> 36:01.969
Just take a breath,
all right? Go.

36:01.971 --> 36:03.488
I know you're angry.

36:03.490 --> 36:05.406
All right?
I know how you feel.

36:05.408 --> 36:07.475
Yeah, you know...
you know how I feel?

36:07.477 --> 36:08.610
Yeah, I do.

36:08.612 --> 36:10.645
I got two boys of my own.

36:10.647 --> 36:12.980
Believe me, if anybody tried
to keep me from them,

36:12.982 --> 36:14.699
I would be pissed off, too.

36:14.701 --> 36:16.701
You're damn straight. No one!

36:16.703 --> 36:20.004
No one is gonna tell me
that I can't see my son!

36:20.006 --> 36:21.789
That's right.
That's right

36:21.791 --> 36:22.874
'cause you're his father.

36:22.876 --> 36:23.925
I'm with you on that, okay?

36:23.927 --> 36:25.260
You got to take care of him

36:25.262 --> 36:26.878
'cause that's
what fathers do, right?

36:26.880 --> 36:28.213
That's right.

36:28.215 --> 36:30.882
Okay, okay, but here's
the problem, Darryl.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.600
Here's the problem.

36:32.602 --> 36:34.769
You got to get control
of your anger

36:34.771 --> 36:36.721
before your anger
takes control of you.

36:36.723 --> 36:38.506
Okay?

36:38.508 --> 36:40.475
I need you to think
about what you're doing here.

36:40.477 --> 36:42.527
I'm trying to get
my son out of here.

36:42.529 --> 36:44.229
Can you understand that?

36:44.231 --> 36:45.864
Course I understand that.

36:45.866 --> 36:47.448
I just need to get away
from here.

36:47.450 --> 36:48.983
That's not gonna
happen today,

36:48.985 --> 36:52.487
okay? We got a dozen cops
around this bus

36:52.489 --> 36:54.021
who do not want to
see anyone get hurt.

36:54.023 --> 36:56.541
I do not want to see anyone
get hurt and guess what--

36:56.543 --> 36:59.627
I don't think you want to see
anyone get hurt either.

36:59.629 --> 37:00.962
Am I right?

37:02.331 --> 37:03.915
Especially not Devon.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.251
I'm trying to help my son,

37:06.253 --> 37:08.219
and you all won't let me do it.

37:08.221 --> 37:12.473
Look, it's time
we focused on him, okay?

37:12.475 --> 37:14.342
Your boy
needs help.

37:14.344 --> 37:16.844
He needs to be back
in the hospital,

37:16.846 --> 37:18.513
all right?
And there's only one person

37:18.515 --> 37:20.548
who has the power
to make that decision--

37:20.550 --> 37:22.400
that's his father.

37:23.819 --> 37:26.738
So why don't you think
about your boy and let me

37:26.740 --> 37:27.855
take him to a safe place?

37:27.857 --> 37:30.491
Let me get him back
to the hospital, okay?

37:42.738 --> 37:45.173
Go on.
No.

37:45.175 --> 37:48.259
Go on, <i>papi.</i>
No!

37:48.261 --> 37:50.261
It's gonna be okay.

37:50.263 --> 37:51.412
Darryl.

37:52.598 --> 37:54.582
I'll give you a second
with your boy

37:54.584 --> 37:56.134
if you give me that gun.

38:00.806 --> 38:03.891
Okay.
Listen, it's gonna be okay.

38:03.893 --> 38:05.109
I love you.

38:05.111 --> 38:07.228
It's gonna be okay.

38:07.230 --> 38:10.398
Okay? It's gonna
be okay, <i>papi.</i>

38:19.792 --> 38:22.827
Come in.

38:22.829 --> 38:25.713
Doc...

38:25.715 --> 38:27.048
Hey.

38:29.134 --> 38:32.587
You know, your... your
required sessions are over.

38:32.589 --> 38:35.256
Yeah, I know that.

38:35.258 --> 38:36.924
You okay?

38:36.926 --> 38:39.844
Yeah, I, um...

38:39.846 --> 38:42.797
I know you think I have
a problem with anger, Doc,

38:42.799 --> 38:45.400
and, uh...

38:45.402 --> 38:47.235
I guess you're right.

38:48.737 --> 38:50.471
Though I also

38:50.473 --> 38:54.308
have a problem
with people not being angry...

38:54.310 --> 38:57.111
not being angry
at senseless violence

38:57.113 --> 39:00.114
and our kids getting shot down
in the street.

39:00.116 --> 39:02.650
Like that ten-year-old boy
who got shot outside his home?

39:02.652 --> 39:05.286
Yeah.

39:05.288 --> 39:06.821
It got to you, didn't it?

39:07.656 --> 39:09.824
Yeah.

39:09.826 --> 39:11.926
What do you do
with all that anger?

39:11.928 --> 39:14.879
I just put it
into catching the bad guys.

39:15.814 --> 39:18.016
But that doesn't make it
any easier.

39:18.851 --> 39:21.001
No.

39:21.003 --> 39:23.771
I looked up your file.

39:23.773 --> 39:26.007
Two tours in Fallujah,

39:26.009 --> 39:27.809
a brother who was killed
in the line of duty.

39:27.811 --> 39:30.111
Yeah, look, Doc, I-I...

39:30.113 --> 39:32.730
I didn't really come
to rehash all that stuff.

39:32.732 --> 39:35.683
I, um...

39:35.685 --> 39:39.037
I just wanted to say I know
there's a lot of guys who do,

39:39.039 --> 39:42.356
but I don't bring
the job home with me.

39:42.358 --> 39:44.208
I don't yell

39:44.210 --> 39:46.327
at my wife and kids.
I don't even let them know

39:46.329 --> 39:49.831
half of what goes on with me.

39:49.833 --> 39:52.216
And that's how it's gonna stay.

39:55.421 --> 39:59.424
And I have no doubt
you're a good dad

39:59.426 --> 40:01.041
and a good husband,

40:01.043 --> 40:03.061
but how do you plan
to keep it all

40:03.063 --> 40:05.212
from eventually
catching up with you?

40:12.489 --> 40:15.389
I don't know.

40:28.554 --> 40:31.456
Well, this is a nice surprise.

40:33.460 --> 40:35.042
Wait...

40:35.044 --> 40:36.844
you're taking Nicky
driving in the city?

40:36.846 --> 40:38.078
What are you thinking?

40:38.080 --> 40:40.014
I was thinking that every driver
should have the pleasure

40:40.016 --> 40:42.583
of driving over the most
beautiful bridge in the world.

40:47.039 --> 40:48.606
I don't know about this.

40:48.608 --> 40:52.193
This is just... You sure
you know what you're doing?

40:53.028 --> 40:55.029
Yep.

40:55.031 --> 40:57.031
And no backseat driving.
Especially from you.

40:57.033 --> 40:58.483
What is that supposed to mean?

40:58.485 --> 40:59.784
Oh, you forgot about the time

40:59.786 --> 41:01.569
when you dented
the back of Dad's car

41:01.571 --> 41:03.821
by backing into your
ex-boyfriend's car?

41:03.823 --> 41:05.773
On purpose.
It was not on purpose.

41:05.775 --> 41:07.625
And then she made me
lie about it,

41:07.627 --> 41:09.160
tell Dad that
it was a stray baseball.

41:09.162 --> 41:10.161
Hey!

41:10.163 --> 41:11.445
Okay, whenever
you're ready, Nicky.

41:11.447 --> 41:13.631
And the time that you got
pulled over for speeding.

41:13.633 --> 41:15.333
I was only going
50 miles per hour.

41:15.335 --> 41:17.418
In a 20-mile-an-hour zone.

41:17.420 --> 41:18.719
Mom, I never knew.

41:18.721 --> 41:19.837
<i>You know what, Jamie?</i>

41:19.839 --> 41:21.622
<i>I have a lot</i>
<i>of ammunition on you,</i>

41:21.624 --> 41:23.341
<i>so you better...</i>

41:31.817 --> 41:34.101
Someone once said that New York

41:34.103 --> 41:37.021
was a place
where dreams come true.

41:37.023 --> 41:38.940
Well, no more so than today.

41:38.942 --> 41:40.358
I'm very happy to announce

41:40.360 --> 41:43.744
that Isabelle Nassar
has been granted a work visa

41:43.746 --> 41:47.281
as a result of a job offer
from the New York Philharmonic.

41:48.042 --> 41:51.761
This gracious offer will
allow Miss Nassar to remain

41:51.763 --> 41:55.381
in the United States and was
made possible by a grant from

41:55.383 --> 41:56.966
the Manhattan Arts Foundation.

41:56.968 --> 42:01.420
I would like to introduce
their president, Joyce Powers.

42:05.859 --> 42:07.926
Thank you so much
to Miss Castillo

42:07.928 --> 42:09.895
and the State Department

42:09.897 --> 42:12.615
for expediting this visa
for Miss Nassar,

42:12.617 --> 42:15.985
a very gifted cellist and
a remarkable young woman,

42:15.987 --> 42:17.637
not only for her
exceptional talent,

42:17.639 --> 42:23.108
but her determination
to make our city her home.

42:23.110 --> 42:27.496
I would like to introduce you
to this extraordinary talent,

42:27.498 --> 42:29.966
Miss Isabelle Nassar.
