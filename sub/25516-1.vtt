00:48.738 --> 00:52.569
There are more
neurons in the human brain,

00:52.604 --> 00:55.779
than stars in the
Milky Way Galaxy.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.681
Pretty fucking cool right?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.479
The fact that all
of energy and matter

01:05.513 --> 01:08.344
exploded from the
center of the universe

01:08.378 --> 01:10.898
and created a pale blue dot

01:12.348 --> 01:17.974
where living, thinking, beings
evolved, with consciousness.

01:22.461 --> 01:27.363
Yet, somehow, that
very consciousness,

01:27.397 --> 01:35.397
our consciousness,
destroys everything.

01:41.066 --> 01:43.896
The battle's aftermath.

01:43.931 --> 01:46.934
The entirety of greed
and hatred and pain

01:46.968 --> 01:49.764
are created in one place
and one place alone,

01:51.318 --> 01:52.319
the human brain.

01:56.254 --> 01:58.635
But what if it didn't
have to be that way?

01:58.670 --> 02:04.158
What if we could
reprogram the human brain?

02:09.783 --> 02:13.063
Last year, I hacked the
NSA surveillance program,

02:13.098 --> 02:14.996
freed a few thousand
zoo animals,

02:15.031 --> 02:18.276
and sucker punched
Cheklovia's nuclear program,

02:20.001 --> 02:24.074
but honestly none of it made
that much of a difference.

02:25.421 --> 02:30.150
I realized that my
hacks were not gonna fix

02:30.184 --> 02:34.050
the real problem,
the human problem.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.781
So, I have a new plan.

02:42.748 --> 02:44.129
To fix human kind.

02:49.238 --> 02:51.688
I'm gonna hack the human mind.

02:56.417 --> 02:59.386
Yeah, that's cool
man, except that we don't have

02:59.420 --> 03:03.252
a proper power source,
hardware, or software.

03:03.286 --> 03:06.082
What about that impossible
to get neural transmitter?

03:06.116 --> 03:07.956
Can you just leave me
alone for like two minutes

03:07.980 --> 03:09.844
so I can have some
peace and quiet?

03:09.879 --> 03:11.363
And go where man?

03:11.398 --> 03:13.779
Did you know that there are
more neurons in the human brain

03:13.814 --> 03:15.505
than stars in the
Milky Way Gala...

04:10.871 --> 04:12.044
Bottles.

04:13.356 --> 04:16.255
600 million plastic
bottles discarded everyday.

04:17.671 --> 04:20.639
Average .4 ounce weight
multiply it by 600 million

04:20.673 --> 04:25.230
equals 260 million
pounds of plastic bottles

04:25.265 --> 04:27.508
thrown away everyday.

04:29.165 --> 04:30.856
What if people knew?

04:30.891 --> 04:32.306
Make it a jam?

04:32.341 --> 04:33.790
They still won't give a shit.

04:41.384 --> 04:42.868
Do we ever get laid man?

04:46.147 --> 04:48.460
You know what really
gets girls wet?

04:48.495 --> 04:49.979
Statistics about bottles.

04:51.394 --> 04:52.913
Since you seem to
be a total wack job,

04:52.947 --> 04:54.511
I'm just wondering if I'll
ever actually get a chance

04:54.535 --> 04:57.227
to see a vagina or if we're
just completely hopeless?

04:58.712 --> 05:00.610
By the way, your
metrics were off.

05:00.645 --> 05:02.336
Tangential growth
counts for 14%,

05:02.371 --> 05:04.165
that's 1.4 billion
bottles a day.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.134
Billion bottles.

05:07.168 --> 05:08.963
Billion bottles.

05:27.223 --> 05:30.226
So, you gonna jack the city's
power supply like I suggested?

05:32.815 --> 05:33.436
Too scared?

05:33.471 --> 05:34.471
No.

05:36.508 --> 05:39.408
Mason, talking to me
is like talking to God.

05:39.442 --> 05:40.823
Complete transparency.

05:41.893 --> 05:42.893
You don't exist.

05:43.722 --> 05:44.722
Bullshit.

05:46.104 --> 05:48.313
I have complete
control over my life.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.348
Bullshit.

05:51.489 --> 05:52.697
I'm not fucking crazy.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.250
Bullshit.

05:56.321 --> 05:57.840
I don't need a reason, okay?

05:59.842 --> 06:01.153
We need that power, Mason,

06:02.327 --> 06:03.615
corporate competition
is hot on our tail.

06:03.639 --> 06:04.433
What are you saying?

06:04.467 --> 06:06.262
Our tail?

06:06.296 --> 06:07.884
You chose the alias, foxy boy.

06:09.092 --> 06:11.198
Come on, keep walking.

06:11.232 --> 06:12.348
I took care of the competition.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.615
And now we need to step it up.

06:14.650 --> 06:16.479
I don't steal from
innocent people, okay.

06:16.514 --> 06:18.136
Innocent?

06:18.170 --> 06:19.344
Who's innocent?

06:19.379 --> 06:20.966
- It's not right.
- Fuck right.

06:22.278 --> 06:23.278
I'm right.

06:24.453 --> 06:26.316
I never said it
wasn't a good idea.

06:27.594 --> 06:28.595
It's a great idea.

06:33.289 --> 06:34.808
Technically I
think it's my idea.

06:34.842 --> 06:36.982
Okay, let's not go crazy.

07:40.011 --> 07:46.880
Mr. Vix, dude, the Uncanny
Douche video, amazing!

07:46.914 --> 07:48.778
Thank you, most love yet.

07:48.813 --> 07:49.813
Care for a snack?

07:53.093 --> 07:54.750
That's not why
we're here, Mason.

07:54.784 --> 07:55.751
I'm good, thank you.

07:55.785 --> 07:56.890
Have you seen Zip?

07:58.754 --> 08:00.376
Sun Moon is looking for you.

08:00.410 --> 08:01.998
Yeah?

08:02.033 --> 08:03.068
Alright, thanks.

08:11.905 --> 08:14.010
Society is just an agreement.

08:14.045 --> 08:16.323
Money, just an agreement.

08:17.635 --> 08:20.914
This place is about
creating your own agreement.

08:28.024 --> 08:29.024
Sun Moon.

08:30.371 --> 08:31.371
Enter.

08:42.383 --> 08:43.764
Have a seat, my friend.

08:45.214 --> 08:46.974
We got to find Zip, Mason.

08:47.009 --> 08:48.434
Yeah thanks, brother,
but I gotta find Zip,

08:48.458 --> 08:50.184
- get some code...
- Sit.

09:01.057 --> 09:02.369
Looking for that thing?

09:08.375 --> 09:10.342
Mason, we are focused okay.

09:10.377 --> 09:11.447
We have things to do.

09:14.484 --> 09:16.417
I just need to amp up a little.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.814
So, what's up?

09:38.439 --> 09:39.751
Nicola is dead.

09:43.168 --> 09:44.168
No.

09:46.793 --> 09:47.966
What happened?

09:50.831 --> 09:51.831
You know.

09:52.971 --> 09:54.455
No, I don't know.

09:54.490 --> 09:55.940
You know I haven't done anything

09:55.974 --> 09:57.389
since the first time, right?

09:59.806 --> 10:00.806
I know.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.053
I don't even know
what she was working on.

10:07.848 --> 10:10.886
A headset to map the human mind.

10:15.822 --> 10:16.650
Wow.

10:16.685 --> 10:17.685
It's pretty dope.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.493
What, you want me
to get it for you?

10:32.528 --> 10:34.323
I want you to
keep your eyes open.

10:35.738 --> 10:38.327
Apparently she was
working with a partner,

10:38.361 --> 10:41.399
named Eden or some
shit like that.

10:43.608 --> 10:44.608
Eden?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.578
Was supposed to be
some sort of legend,

10:50.028 --> 10:54.515
but started tooling
himself and got lost.

10:56.621 --> 10:58.968
Experimenting on himself, huh?

10:59.003 --> 11:00.660
Oh, you know how
that story goes.

11:02.696 --> 11:03.696
Right?

11:11.740 --> 11:14.984
If you hear anything,
you let me know.

11:19.161 --> 11:20.161
Yeah.

11:22.164 --> 11:23.164
Vix.

11:28.170 --> 11:32.899
Whatever you're working
on, the fix is in here.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.907
- Information is bliss.
- Information is bliss.

11:45.566 --> 11:47.189
I think I'm in love.

11:48.777 --> 11:50.019
Hi.

11:50.054 --> 11:53.057
Hey Vix, we're about
to have a jam session.

11:54.058 --> 11:55.058
You dig?

13:41.475 --> 13:43.063
Hey, have you seen Zip?

13:50.174 --> 13:52.521
Zip, yo man, I'm
here for my code.

13:53.729 --> 13:55.455
You know he
doesn't have it, man.

13:56.421 --> 13:57.421
He better.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.701
Hey, come on man, you
said you'd have it today.

14:00.736 --> 14:03.014
We knew this was
gonna happen, man.

14:03.049 --> 14:04.498
Shut up.

14:05.361 --> 14:06.811
Zip, come on, let me in.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.158
He's a fucking junkie, man.

14:09.193 --> 14:10.513
He's the best coder in the city.

14:10.539 --> 14:11.896
We should have written
that shit ourselves.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.404
It would've taken me months.

14:15.061 --> 14:16.269
He fucked us, man.

14:17.339 --> 14:18.996
Now we need to
escalate on this guy.

14:20.445 --> 14:21.446
What do you know?

14:22.792 --> 14:24.656
I know we resold Chinese
electronics on eBay

14:24.691 --> 14:27.142
and jerked off into a Petri
dish to pay him for it.

14:33.734 --> 14:35.495
Goddammit.

14:35.529 --> 14:38.843
Zip, you said you would
have it for me today, man.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.924
- Come on, Zip.
- There we go.

14:39.948 --> 14:41.087
Come on.

14:41.121 --> 14:43.779
You said you
would have it today.

14:48.611 --> 14:50.199
What the fuck?

14:50.234 --> 14:51.718
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

14:51.752 --> 14:52.752
What?

14:53.927 --> 14:56.136
You're not gonna do anything?

14:56.171 --> 14:57.793
I'm just gonna wait it out.

14:57.827 --> 14:59.588
Figure out this
plastic bottle jam.

15:01.348 --> 15:02.418
You're gonna wait?

15:05.214 --> 15:06.595
This is the exact problem.

15:07.492 --> 15:08.493
What is?

15:08.528 --> 15:09.943
This.

15:09.978 --> 15:12.428
Every little bump derails us
on some small time distraction.

15:12.463 --> 15:14.327
Plastic is a big
fucking problem.

15:14.361 --> 15:16.985
Are you fucking talking
about plastic again?

15:17.019 --> 15:19.021
I will hemorrhage in
your fucking brain.

15:20.989 --> 15:21.989
Focus!

15:23.992 --> 15:25.510
It is not the root problem.

15:27.547 --> 15:28.858
Isn't this why we're here?

15:31.689 --> 15:32.689
Mason.

15:35.072 --> 15:38.868
We can change the entire world.

15:41.492 --> 15:45.565
Well what do you want me to do?

15:45.599 --> 15:48.464
I want us to get
what we are here for.

15:50.432 --> 15:51.719
I can't just break down the door

15:51.743 --> 15:52.893
and put him in a to go baggy.

15:52.917 --> 15:54.643
Of course you can!

15:54.677 --> 15:57.680
- There are rules, okay?
- Fuck rules, man!

15:57.715 --> 15:58.923
There are no rules.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.245
Since when do you
listen to rules?

16:00.269 --> 16:01.167
Don't you know anything?

16:01.201 --> 16:02.858
Nobody breaks Sun Moon's code.

16:02.892 --> 16:05.723
Oh, so he's the daddy
you wish we always had?

16:08.208 --> 16:09.451
You know nothing about me.

16:09.485 --> 16:11.384
I know everything about you.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.697
You don't exist.

16:16.596 --> 16:17.607
Then who the fuck
you talking to?

16:17.631 --> 16:19.357
A mental projection!

16:19.392 --> 16:22.360
A freak disconnect in my brain!

16:26.675 --> 16:29.160
That's what you think of me?

16:32.922 --> 16:34.683
You're really something,
man, you know that.

16:36.271 --> 16:38.376
I don't know what
to think, okay?

16:39.515 --> 16:40.896
I've manifested a...

16:42.863 --> 16:43.863
A what?

16:45.176 --> 16:46.591
Go, say it, a what?

16:49.353 --> 16:53.150
A part of myself
from some dark matter,

16:53.184 --> 16:57.602
and obviously it means
you're here for a reason.

17:08.372 --> 17:12.617
Mason, society's
rules are vapor.

17:13.617 --> 17:14.757
They mean nothing.

17:19.244 --> 17:21.763
Do you want to save the world?

17:23.249 --> 17:24.491
Boom.

17:24.526 --> 17:25.251
Boom.

17:25.527 --> 17:26.631
Boom.

17:26.838 --> 17:27.838
Boom.

17:29.117 --> 17:30.117
Boom.

17:46.479 --> 17:47.479
Zip!

17:52.623 --> 17:53.623
Zip.

18:04.669 --> 18:06.671
You didn't even knock.

18:11.987 --> 18:13.195
Hey, come on.

18:14.162 --> 18:15.991
Come on, Zip.

18:16.025 --> 18:17.025
Hey.

18:26.174 --> 18:29.073
Come on, there we
go, easy does it.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.143
Dude.

19:07.076 --> 19:08.250
He still alive?

19:10.390 --> 19:11.978
Yeah, he's alive.

19:15.878 --> 19:17.880
Wish I could lend
a hand, but you know.

19:19.399 --> 19:21.332
Oh, shit!

19:21.367 --> 19:23.886
Shit shit shit, stop screaming!

19:23.921 --> 19:26.061
I'm coming towards the light!

19:26.095 --> 19:28.236
I'm coming towards the light!

19:28.270 --> 19:30.203
Stop squirming, stop
it, stop it I'll help you!

19:30.238 --> 19:32.516
Hey, hey, hey Zip!
Shut the fuck up.

19:32.550 --> 19:35.864
Zip, Zip.

19:35.898 --> 19:38.660
I took it off, all right?

19:42.388 --> 19:43.492
Vix?

19:43.527 --> 19:48.221
Man, I thought I was dead, man.

19:49.395 --> 19:50.879
No, no, you're good, bro.

19:53.571 --> 19:55.159
What the hell am
I doing in this bag?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.988
Bet you never
thought you'd say that.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.061
Don't waste time
on this asshole.

20:01.096 --> 20:02.856
Look, I need my code.

20:05.376 --> 20:09.587
Oh, I'm sorry man,
moms took my computer.

20:09.622 --> 20:11.762
Do not let this
guy fuck with us.

20:11.796 --> 20:12.590
You fucking with me?

20:12.625 --> 20:14.005
No, no man.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.040
Mmm-hmm.

20:21.289 --> 20:23.498
He's not gonna deliver
until we escalate.

20:23.532 --> 20:25.441
Zip, man don't make me an
asshole, I need this code.

20:25.465 --> 20:27.226
Man, come on, man, look at me.

20:28.365 --> 20:29.745
I said escalate, Mason!

20:29.780 --> 20:31.299
Hey, don't fuck with me, man!

20:32.403 --> 20:34.612
I can't sit still that long.

20:34.647 --> 20:36.511
You better have
that shit backed up,

20:36.545 --> 20:39.203
tell me your mom didn't
recycle 10 grand.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.860
I'm gonna tell
Sun Moon, that you...

20:40.894 --> 20:43.034
You ain't saying shit, alright?!

20:43.069 --> 20:45.796
I need this code!
And I need more cash, man!

20:45.830 --> 20:46.762
Fuck him up, Mason!

20:46.797 --> 20:47.729
Don't fuck with me, man!

20:47.763 --> 20:49.109
Hey, come on, Vix, Vix, Vix.

20:49.144 --> 20:50.673
- Do it Mason!
- Don't fuck with me, man!

20:50.697 --> 20:51.940
Hey, Vix!

20:51.974 --> 20:53.158
Come on man, this
ain't like you, man.

20:53.182 --> 20:55.737
It's like me, motherfucker!

20:55.771 --> 20:56.945
Ah!

20:56.979 --> 20:58.705
Did you just flick me?

20:58.740 --> 21:00.224
- Yeah.
- Did you just flick him?

21:00.259 --> 21:01.329
What the fuck was that?

21:01.363 --> 21:02.675
Hit the motherfucker
in the face.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.333
Hit him!

21:05.367 --> 21:06.334
Oh.

21:06.368 --> 21:08.612
- My God.
- Come on Mason, harder!

21:08.646 --> 21:09.820
Harder, man!

21:09.854 --> 21:14.721
Fucking harder!

21:36.605 --> 21:40.160
Okay, okay, okay,
alright, okay, okay!

21:41.127 --> 21:42.508
Okay, I have it.

21:42.542 --> 21:44.337
- You got it?
- I'll fucking finish it.

21:44.372 --> 21:46.512
Yeah, you didn't have to
punch me in the fucking face.

21:46.546 --> 21:48.997
- Where is it?
- It's here!

21:49.031 --> 21:49.963
It's here!

21:49.998 --> 21:51.009
You don't want to hurt this!

21:51.033 --> 21:52.483
Can you do it on my machine?

21:53.450 --> 21:54.450
Yeah.

21:55.417 --> 21:56.729
And how much have you got done?

21:58.247 --> 21:59.525
I haven't started.

21:59.559 --> 22:01.354
- Fuck, man!
- Okay.

22:01.389 --> 22:03.494
How long is it gonna take?

22:03.529 --> 22:04.737
A few hours?

22:04.771 --> 22:05.771
Few hours.

22:09.811 --> 22:10.812
You're not lying to me?

22:10.846 --> 22:13.470
No, no, no man, I got you bro.

22:13.504 --> 22:14.678
I got you this time.

22:19.061 --> 22:21.685
I got my eye on
you motherfucker.

22:21.719 --> 22:23.238
You'll live in that trash bag.

22:26.931 --> 22:28.001
Later, sucker!

22:42.430 --> 22:43.752
That's how you
greet new neighbors?

22:43.776 --> 22:45.502
Shopping cart ambush?

22:47.435 --> 22:48.781
Oh shit, you're bleeding.

22:50.023 --> 22:51.922
Oh, no biggie.

22:51.956 --> 22:53.372
This girl is unbelievable.

22:56.098 --> 22:57.652
Who's your friend?

22:57.686 --> 22:58.686
Hi.

23:01.449 --> 23:02.967
Welcome to the neighborhood.

23:07.282 --> 23:08.870
You're Mr. Vix, right?

23:10.181 --> 23:12.805
I've seen you
before, dummy, at HQ,

23:14.634 --> 23:17.706
but what's with the stupid mask?

23:17.741 --> 23:19.259
Valid point.

23:19.294 --> 23:23.160
And why do you always
seem to breaking things?

23:23.194 --> 23:25.542
Can't you make
something for once?

23:27.095 --> 23:29.718
I make things.

23:29.753 --> 23:30.547
Oh!

23:30.581 --> 23:31.581
Like what?

23:32.307 --> 23:33.791
Yeah, Mason, like what?

23:39.107 --> 23:40.705
Well, sometimes you
have to destroy systems

23:40.729 --> 23:42.075
in order to build new ones.

23:44.181 --> 23:45.562
You want help with your bag?

23:45.596 --> 23:46.804
No!

23:46.839 --> 23:50.636
No, I couldn't ask after
all that ambush thing.

23:53.535 --> 23:54.709
I didn't get your name.

23:55.744 --> 23:57.159
Sawyer.

23:57.194 --> 23:58.437
What's yours?

23:58.471 --> 23:59.759
Doesn't fucking
matter, she's the one.

23:59.783 --> 24:01.440
Wrap this shit up.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.579
Mason.

24:02.924 --> 24:03.924
Mason.

24:06.306 --> 24:07.306
Well.

24:09.344 --> 24:11.242
See you around, Mason.

24:11.277 --> 24:13.037
Invite her inside
you fucking pussy.

24:13.072 --> 24:14.072
Okay.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.286
Go make something, Mason!

24:21.701 --> 24:22.701
Bye.

24:24.532 --> 24:25.671
Bye.

24:25.705 --> 24:26.913
You suck at life.

24:28.743 --> 24:29.847
Hey, sweetie, wait up!

24:30.710 --> 24:31.987
Come here!

24:32.022 --> 24:34.265
Come on what do you like
to do, roller skate?

25:48.719 --> 25:50.376
If you added up the signals

25:50.410 --> 25:53.482
from the entire telecommunication
system on earth,

25:53.517 --> 25:57.866
it would not equal the complexity
of a single human brain.

25:59.247 --> 26:01.214
The only hope of rewriting
a system so complex

26:01.249 --> 26:03.009
is to fully understand
its structure.

26:03.044 --> 26:06.668
Crap, ugh this
sequence is insane.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.742
Zip here is finishing
a code that will allow us

26:11.777 --> 26:16.575
to map the entire human brain,
learn from that code and...

26:19.439 --> 26:20.648
Rewrite that code.

26:21.683 --> 26:22.683
Nice, dude.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.758
Soon, I will be able
to enhance and/or delete

26:27.793 --> 26:31.003
every deficiency of the
human brain with updates,

26:31.037 --> 26:32.832
like computer software.

26:32.867 --> 26:34.361
How are you gonna
spread those upgrades?

26:34.385 --> 26:35.386
You know how.

26:35.421 --> 26:36.560
You're a mad man.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.699
The point is...

26:37.734 --> 26:40.944
We'll rewrite humanity
on our own terms.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.601
My terms.

26:53.473 --> 26:54.647
You know what we need.

26:56.304 --> 26:57.304
Nicola's headset.

27:00.446 --> 27:03.932
I'll just borrow an EEG 10
from some lab and modify it.

27:07.798 --> 27:09.179
Borrow an EEG 10?

27:10.594 --> 27:12.182
Yeah.

27:12.216 --> 27:13.216
Eden.

27:14.218 --> 27:15.668
- What?
- You heard me.

27:17.359 --> 27:20.915
- Eden's just a myth.
- Tell that to Nicola.

27:20.949 --> 27:22.824
Nicola was selfish, it
could have been anybody.

27:22.848 --> 27:24.228
- Selfish?
- Yeah.

27:25.402 --> 27:27.335
Nicola was a fucking genius,

27:27.369 --> 27:28.992
you have no idea what
was motivating her.

27:29.026 --> 27:30.306
You say that like you knew her.

27:30.338 --> 27:31.822
I did.

27:31.857 --> 27:34.791
Whether you like it or not,
your history is my history.

27:38.311 --> 27:40.037
I'm losing my fucking mind.

27:41.383 --> 27:42.868
Nicola's headset is key.

27:43.834 --> 27:45.111
You borrow some EEG 10

27:45.146 --> 27:47.148
and they'll be on you
like pigs in shit.

27:47.182 --> 27:48.736
Even if this guy is real

27:48.770 --> 27:51.152
no one has any clue
where he is, okay?

27:52.705 --> 27:57.192
Mason, fear and morality
and every other human concept

27:57.227 --> 27:58.884
in the world will
become irrelevant

27:58.918 --> 28:00.195
once we have that headset.

28:02.301 --> 28:04.406
If there's anyone that
can do it, it's us.

28:06.408 --> 28:07.408
Donezo!

28:24.392 --> 28:26.463
Zip!

28:26.497 --> 28:28.223
I love you, man!

28:28.258 --> 28:29.846
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

28:31.019 --> 28:33.435
Yo, who you been
talking to, man?

28:34.851 --> 28:36.093
Me, dickhead.

28:36.128 --> 28:39.648
Honestly, my
imaginary projection.

28:42.479 --> 28:44.723
Oh word, okay, what's his name?

28:44.757 --> 28:47.656
- Finn.
- Finn and Mason?

28:47.691 --> 28:50.142
Sounds like a shitty
clothing store.

28:53.870 --> 28:54.802
I got something else for you.

28:54.836 --> 28:56.320
Oh, yeah what's that?

28:56.355 --> 28:58.771
Ooh, you're gonna owe
me big time for this one.

28:58.806 --> 29:00.255
What is it?

29:00.290 --> 29:04.743
I set up Eden's shop,
and I dropped a GPS tag.

29:09.644 --> 29:10.818
I'm gonna need a mask.

29:13.959 --> 29:15.098
Weird looking.

29:19.447 --> 29:20.966
You look like a child.

29:25.349 --> 29:28.007
I can't be seen
with you like this.

29:28.042 --> 29:30.596
I can't be seen with
you anyway, but.

29:30.630 --> 29:31.666
I like it.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.875
Fuck you.

29:33.910 --> 29:34.980
Fucking weirdo.

29:35.877 --> 29:37.810
No you're the fucking weirdo.

29:37.845 --> 29:39.018
We're both fucking weirdos.

29:39.053 --> 29:40.779
Let's take over
the world together.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.298
This is in your mind.

29:45.438 --> 29:47.544
I just want you to
feel right, you know.

29:53.550 --> 29:54.550
Yes.

30:38.284 --> 30:39.872
Freeze, motherfucker!

30:39.907 --> 30:41.874
Dammit, Finn!

30:41.909 --> 30:44.704
I fucking love this place.

30:44.739 --> 30:45.739
Hello!

30:46.637 --> 30:48.191
Hello!

30:48.225 --> 30:50.193
Are you not entertained?

30:53.817 --> 30:57.165
You think it's true what
they're saying about this guy?

30:57.200 --> 31:00.824
Hard to say, my man,
hard to fucking say.

31:00.859 --> 31:01.859
Pretty messed up.

31:02.964 --> 31:04.690
I've seen worse.

31:04.724 --> 31:07.313
Oh, have you?

31:07.348 --> 31:08.142
Don't presume to know
everything there is

31:08.176 --> 31:09.798
to know about me, Mason.

31:10.972 --> 31:13.733
Just don't fuck with
me in here, all right?

31:13.768 --> 31:15.666
I'm on your team, my man.

31:15.701 --> 31:18.117
There is no fucking
that I am not a part of.

31:31.993 --> 31:32.993
Shit.

31:36.411 --> 31:37.411
Think he saw us?

31:40.691 --> 31:42.210
Huh?

31:42.245 --> 31:45.317
Well he's in a nuclear bunker

31:46.283 --> 31:47.906
so I don't think
he gives a fuck.

31:49.528 --> 31:50.528
Oh, shit.

31:52.048 --> 31:54.705
Don't worry,
man, you can crack it.

31:54.740 --> 31:57.398
Zip didn't say anything
about a door with no handle.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.992
You're nervous.

32:05.026 --> 32:06.648
Of course I'm fucking nervous.

32:07.580 --> 32:09.858
You curse when you get nervous.

32:09.893 --> 32:11.860
You heard what he
said about this guy.

32:14.277 --> 32:15.726
Yeah, no, you're right,

32:15.761 --> 32:17.797
we should go home and
get the fuck out of here.

32:17.832 --> 32:19.178
Finn!

32:19.213 --> 32:21.042
I need your help on this.

32:21.077 --> 32:22.975
Sorry!

32:23.010 --> 32:24.563
Have fun!

32:24.597 --> 32:25.597
Finn!

32:26.806 --> 32:28.291
I need your help.

32:28.325 --> 32:29.325
There you go.

32:33.158 --> 32:35.505
Have you ever tried to
go somewhere I wasn't?

32:41.097 --> 32:42.097
All the time.

32:43.168 --> 32:44.203
Has it ever worked?

32:48.035 --> 32:49.035
No.

32:51.935 --> 32:52.935
Can you try?

32:54.420 --> 32:55.732
Huh?

32:55.766 --> 32:56.766
Can you try?

33:00.116 --> 33:02.359
I think that's more
on you, than it is me.

33:04.844 --> 33:05.844
Okay.

33:08.607 --> 33:09.607
Okay what?

33:10.816 --> 33:11.816
Let's do it.

33:13.957 --> 33:14.957
Okay.

33:16.339 --> 33:17.339
Let's do it!

33:19.342 --> 33:20.342
Let's do what?

33:21.654 --> 33:22.862
Transcendence, man.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.935
You're out of your fucking mind.

33:26.970 --> 33:29.386
No, you're out of my mind.

33:35.392 --> 33:36.497
Okay, what do we do?

33:39.534 --> 33:41.812
Well we know from quantum
physics that time and space

33:41.847 --> 33:43.711
are only relative
to our perspective.

33:45.092 --> 33:47.128
We need to see
that room so wholly

33:47.163 --> 33:51.719
in our mind's eye you'll
actually be there.

33:53.617 --> 33:58.622
Okay.

34:00.383 --> 34:06.078
The room is square,
20 feet by 20 feet.

34:06.113 --> 34:07.183
The walls are silver.

34:09.116 --> 34:10.978
In the center of
the room is a chair.

34:12.739 --> 34:16.433
Inside that chair is
a guy called Eden.

34:22.750 --> 34:23.750
Holy shit.

34:28.273 --> 34:29.273
Finn?!

34:30.654 --> 34:32.242
- Mason.
- Finn?!

34:34.141 --> 34:36.246
- I'm inside.
- No?!

34:37.799 --> 34:38.799
What's happening?

34:44.668 --> 34:45.668
Shit.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.091
Looks like he's
digitizing his brain.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.746
Shit!

34:54.782 --> 34:55.782
Is he asleep?

34:56.922 --> 34:57.922
Catatonic.

34:59.027 --> 35:00.419
Shit, this is the
last puzzle piece!

35:00.443 --> 35:01.375
Is there a door?

35:01.409 --> 35:02.479
An alarm?

35:07.312 --> 35:08.554
No, there's no way out.

35:09.659 --> 35:10.981
It must be voice
activated or something.

35:11.005 --> 35:12.005
Think!

35:14.146 --> 35:15.596
This is our last chance, man.

35:23.983 --> 35:24.983
Mason?

35:26.054 --> 35:27.054
Yeah?

35:33.131 --> 35:35.788
What's to say I
can't project you here?

35:42.105 --> 35:43.105
Nothing.

35:49.285 --> 35:51.563
Apart from the fact that
I'm made of physical matter

35:51.597 --> 35:54.013
and that would be
physically impossible.

36:01.331 --> 36:02.331
Finn?

36:05.680 --> 36:06.680
Finn?

36:35.400 --> 36:36.400
Open the door.

36:41.095 --> 36:42.476
I said open the door!

36:44.650 --> 36:46.963
I'm gonna skin you
alive, you little rodent.

36:49.586 --> 36:51.830
Say the code and open the door

36:51.864 --> 36:53.280
or I will break your machine.

36:58.940 --> 36:59.940
Reckoning.

37:13.161 --> 37:14.542
You killed Nicola.

37:29.695 --> 37:33.354
If I ever see you again,
I'm gonna kill you.

38:08.976 --> 38:10.391
Hey, it's Zip,

38:10.426 --> 38:14.568
I'm not picking up my phone
ever so leave a message.

38:14.602 --> 38:19.158
Yo Zip, man, give me a call,
alright, some shit went down.

38:20.643 --> 38:21.643
Okay.

38:22.921 --> 38:23.921
Mason.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.480
Mason.

38:34.035 --> 38:35.416
Mason, Mason.

38:35.451 --> 38:36.279
Where are you?

38:36.314 --> 38:37.314
Mason.

38:49.292 --> 38:50.292
Hi.

38:55.402 --> 38:57.162
Is someone day tripping?

39:00.199 --> 39:01.199
Must be good.

39:07.724 --> 39:11.141
This area just
needed a little life.

39:15.663 --> 39:17.182
Sorry, I just...

39:20.461 --> 39:22.912
Want to see something cool?

40:13.411 --> 40:15.067
Jammers and germs.

40:18.001 --> 40:20.487
It's time to change the world.

40:28.046 --> 40:29.703
By decoding the human brain

40:29.737 --> 40:34.224
and all of it's beautiful,
terrible intricacy.

40:36.330 --> 40:38.159
I hope to discover
what might just be

40:40.161 --> 40:41.715
the spark of consciousness.

40:44.303 --> 40:45.581
The spark of life.

41:52.682 --> 41:53.682
Mason.

42:02.278 --> 42:03.278
Come here.

42:05.592 --> 42:06.592
This way.

42:10.769 --> 42:13.013
Want to see something cool?

42:17.258 --> 42:22.160
Okay, so, your brain is made
of over 80 billion neurons,

42:22.194 --> 42:23.989
none of which give
a damn about you.

42:25.163 --> 42:27.924
Now they work just like
an on and off switch.

42:29.063 --> 42:30.651
So the zillion dollar question

42:30.686 --> 42:33.274
is why did these
signals originate?

42:35.691 --> 42:39.522
No one knows, so that's
what I want to find out.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.420
So by finding out the
code of consciousness,

42:41.455 --> 42:43.630
I'll be able to find
out the original spark.

42:45.735 --> 42:47.185
Original spark of what?

42:49.843 --> 42:50.843
Of life.

42:52.949 --> 42:53.949
Wow.

42:57.402 --> 42:58.955
That's what I'm gonna rewrite.

43:00.957 --> 43:02.200
Rewrite?

43:02.234 --> 43:03.234
Yeah.

43:04.892 --> 43:06.514
Why?

43:06.549 --> 43:09.172
Because human beings are
programmed to destroy everything.

43:10.933 --> 43:13.487
- And create.
- By destruction.

43:16.870 --> 43:20.805
I know it sounds crazy, but
I've thought this through.

43:20.839 --> 43:22.738
But what if we're
flawed for a reason.

43:22.772 --> 43:24.015
We're just outdated.

43:24.049 --> 43:26.638
You realize you would
be playing God right?

43:30.987 --> 43:32.713
I've had a long
day and I don't...

43:32.748 --> 43:35.371
- Answer the question.
- I just want to fix people.

43:38.167 --> 43:41.377
But what if I don't
want my mind rewritten?

43:42.516 --> 43:43.976
What if I want to figure
life out for myself?

43:44.000 --> 43:46.554
That sounds like
a human deficiency.

43:46.589 --> 43:47.670
Free will is a deficiency?

43:47.694 --> 43:49.592
No it's not that, it's...

43:49.627 --> 43:51.456
The brain is
programmed in a very...

43:54.701 --> 43:56.254
I know what I'm doing, okay?

44:06.022 --> 44:07.022
Mason.

44:10.164 --> 44:11.407
Anyone who thinks they know

44:11.441 --> 44:14.824
the answer to life
is full of shit.

44:24.731 --> 44:25.870
I got to go.

44:59.179 --> 45:00.179
Amazing.

45:04.287 --> 45:06.289
Do you think this is it?

45:15.505 --> 45:16.714
It's the Ichor.

45:19.095 --> 45:20.856
The blood of the gods.

45:24.376 --> 45:25.376
Consciousness.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.972
Finn, wait.

45:34.007 --> 45:35.008
Finn, don't.

45:37.148 --> 45:38.148
Finn!

45:39.046 --> 45:40.046
Finn!

45:40.807 --> 45:41.807
Finn!

46:20.294 --> 46:21.294
It's gone.

46:30.857 --> 46:31.857
Mason.

46:33.721 --> 46:34.721
What?

46:42.592 --> 46:43.697
I can feel.

46:53.051 --> 46:54.881
I can feel everything.

47:28.776 --> 47:30.675
Sun Moon.

47:33.229 --> 47:36.474
So you know nothing
about this tracker?

47:40.788 --> 47:47.761
I told you, people
here do as they please.

47:47.795 --> 47:49.004
That's the whole idea.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.388
That's a beautiful way to live.

47:54.423 --> 47:58.185
Do what you please, as
long as no one gets hurt.

48:02.293 --> 48:03.950
Well I did get hurt.

48:06.987 --> 48:08.644
What do you want?

48:11.681 --> 48:15.513
I'm deeply troubled
that you don't see

48:15.547 --> 48:17.273
the irony in your own existence.

48:17.308 --> 48:25.308
You had something here, and
yet besides a few bent rules,

48:27.180 --> 48:34.187
you cling to the human law
like a pet on a long leash.

48:36.810 --> 48:39.330
Where is the revolution?

48:39.364 --> 48:42.298
Where is the reckoning?

48:46.164 --> 48:47.164
Poor man.

48:50.099 --> 48:54.690
Life itself is the reckoning.

49:03.009 --> 49:10.533
Maybe that's why my little
toy elicits such physical pain.

49:39.079 --> 49:41.116
Tell me what you want.

49:41.150 --> 49:45.327
I want you realize that
your life is meaningless

49:46.914 --> 49:51.057
and I want to know who
wears the vermin mask.

49:57.270 --> 49:58.270
Ah.

49:59.513 --> 50:00.513
You know him.

50:07.245 --> 50:08.281
Where can I find him?

50:25.160 --> 50:26.540
Tell me his name.

50:26.575 --> 50:28.577
I don't know his name.

50:35.929 --> 50:38.794
Tell me, his name.

50:52.601 --> 50:54.534
Fuck you!

51:35.989 --> 51:37.094
He's a ghost.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.340
No one knows where he is.

51:50.279 --> 51:55.250
Then it seems you no
longer have any value to me.

52:02.429 --> 52:04.949
The reckoning then.

52:31.355 --> 52:32.770
Dammit.

52:34.427 --> 52:35.807
I want food, Mason.

52:37.499 --> 52:38.534
I need food.

52:40.571 --> 52:41.744
I want a pizza.

52:43.746 --> 52:45.310
Yeah, well I've told
you we can't go anywhere

52:45.334 --> 52:47.612
until I figure out
what's going on.

52:47.647 --> 52:49.925
Mason, I don't
think you understand,

52:49.959 --> 52:51.823
I'm the hungriest man alive.

52:52.997 --> 52:54.216
Do you not care
what's happening here?

52:54.240 --> 52:55.240
I do not.

52:56.242 --> 52:57.760
We can fix it later.

52:57.795 --> 52:59.221
You have seen all the crazy
shit that's gone on, right?

52:59.245 --> 53:00.246
Yes.

53:00.280 --> 53:01.557
And now I feel...

53:03.283 --> 53:07.287
I feel like I'm going
to murder someone

53:07.322 --> 53:08.564
if I don't get some food.

53:09.979 --> 53:11.094
This whole thing is your idea

53:11.118 --> 53:13.224
so no we're not going anywhere.

53:14.639 --> 53:16.572
This piece of shit, I
think the Q chip is fried.

53:23.648 --> 53:25.029
I want girls, Mason.

53:26.582 --> 53:27.928
I want all of the girls.

53:29.896 --> 53:32.899
I want to explode inside every
single girl on this planet.

53:35.798 --> 53:38.076
Oh shit, what am I doing?

53:39.388 --> 53:41.356
- I'm going out now.
- No, you're not.

53:42.564 --> 53:45.360
I deserve it after
all I've gone through.

53:45.394 --> 53:46.602
You've gone through?

53:46.637 --> 53:48.121
You haven't felt
any of this shit.

53:49.881 --> 53:51.469
The rules have changed, Mason.

53:53.437 --> 53:55.577
What the fuck?

53:56.474 --> 53:57.855
Equal partners, my man.

53:57.889 --> 53:58.994
That's the haps.

54:03.550 --> 54:05.380
I am losing my mind.

54:06.829 --> 54:10.764
I have physically manifested
a projection from my mind.

54:13.974 --> 54:14.974
Your mind?

54:15.873 --> 54:16.805
- Yeah.
- Your mind?

54:16.839 --> 54:17.737
That's what you think?

54:17.771 --> 54:18.771
Yeah, my mind.

54:21.430 --> 54:24.399
That is exactly
the fucking problem!

54:24.433 --> 54:25.433
What is?

54:30.059 --> 54:34.167
You think I'm just like a
part of your fucking brain?

54:34.201 --> 54:35.099
Right?

54:35.133 --> 54:37.515
Like a synaptic mishap?

54:37.550 --> 54:39.310
That's what you think,
you're the genius,

54:39.345 --> 54:41.219
you're all that matters, is
that what you fucking think?

54:41.243 --> 54:43.521
I'm just trying to fix it, okay?

54:45.799 --> 54:47.663
I cannot believe
how selfish you are.

54:49.182 --> 54:51.011
- Selfish?
- Yeah.

54:51.046 --> 54:53.324
Selfish!

54:53.359 --> 54:54.739
You think I'm fucking selfish?

54:54.774 --> 54:55.774
Yeah.

54:56.741 --> 55:00.469
I am your fucking
self, you fucking idiot!

55:00.504 --> 55:03.852
I spent my entire life
on that project of yours!

55:03.886 --> 55:06.130
And now you're alive!

55:06.164 --> 55:08.960
You touched the fucking space
goo and now you're alive!

55:08.995 --> 55:11.411
That could have been
the physical embodiment

55:11.446 --> 55:14.483
of consciousness,
essentially a God,

55:14.518 --> 55:16.899
and if you've broken it
or altered it somehow,

55:16.934 --> 55:19.902
who knows what's happening
to our existence, okay?

55:19.937 --> 55:21.801
Can you get that
into your shit brain!

55:36.436 --> 55:42.131
I don't know what happened
to me or how I became real,

55:44.755 --> 55:49.760
but if this is what
broken feels like, fuck!

55:52.072 --> 55:54.247
Why would anybody want to fixed?

55:56.180 --> 55:57.871
You're the genius, Mason.

55:59.321 --> 56:00.322
You'll figure it out.

56:01.288 --> 56:02.082
Finn, Finn!

56:02.117 --> 56:03.325
Finn, wait!

56:03.360 --> 56:07.467
- Let go of me.
- You can't go.

56:08.261 --> 56:10.125
I can do whatever
the fuck I want.

56:18.444 --> 56:19.444
Wow.

56:39.326 --> 56:40.326
Hello!

56:45.056 --> 56:46.541
I'm fucking alive!

56:57.068 --> 56:58.068
Fuck.

57:00.244 --> 57:01.244
Fuck me.

58:20.255 --> 58:25.260
I'll take the purple one.

58:25.847 --> 58:26.848
Good choice.

58:39.446 --> 58:40.758
That's purple.

01:01:08.147 --> 01:01:10.390
- I need a dose.
- Mr. Vix!

01:01:23.231 --> 01:01:26.061
Have you seen a guy called Finn?

01:01:43.665 --> 01:01:44.665
Yo!

01:01:45.598 --> 01:01:46.598
Yo!

01:01:48.152 --> 01:01:49.152
Yo.

01:01:50.258 --> 01:01:51.258
Mason?

01:01:52.985 --> 01:01:54.952
I just had my first dream.

01:01:57.368 --> 01:01:59.129
Did you not just
feel what happened?

01:02:02.028 --> 01:02:03.478
What?

01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:07.724
We were glitching?

01:02:08.966 --> 01:02:10.968
Is that what that was?

01:02:16.111 --> 01:02:17.837
What the fuck, man?

01:02:19.287 --> 01:02:21.254
The map is fragmenting,
the processor is fried,

01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:22.473
and you're lying here
as high as a kite.

01:02:22.497 --> 01:02:23.670
We have to fix this!

01:02:25.396 --> 01:02:26.777
I'm taking a little break.

01:02:28.883 --> 01:02:30.677
We were just fucking glitching.

01:02:33.888 --> 01:02:37.270
Look, Eden's lab, the
Q chip is still there.

01:02:37.305 --> 01:02:38.513
Mason.

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:39.801
I smashed the computer but
most of the hardware must be...

01:02:39.825 --> 01:02:40.825
Mason!

01:02:44.243 --> 01:02:46.590
I'm not going back down there.

01:02:47.902 --> 01:02:48.902
We have to.

01:02:52.872 --> 01:02:56.117
No, we don't.

01:02:59.016 --> 01:03:00.466
We don't have a choice, Finn.

01:03:02.744 --> 01:03:06.403
There's always a choice, Mason,
you know that by now right?

01:03:09.855 --> 01:03:11.408
We can make any choice we want.

01:03:12.858 --> 01:03:17.828
We could just stop
all this crazy shit

01:03:18.725 --> 01:03:20.141
and just live our fucking lives.

01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:22.590
What?

01:03:27.389 --> 01:03:28.459
I've been thinking.

01:03:33.913 --> 01:03:35.087
None of this matters.

01:03:38.055 --> 01:03:39.263
None of it's worth it.

01:03:40.955 --> 01:03:41.852
You know what I mean?

01:03:41.887 --> 01:03:45.614
People, they aren't worth it.

01:03:47.996 --> 01:03:49.170
What are you saying?

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:58.006
There's just,
there's more to life.

01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:00.871
I mean, there's so much, fuck,

01:04:00.906 --> 01:04:02.839
look, there's so
much more to life.

01:04:04.564 --> 01:04:05.738
Like enjoying yourself.

01:04:12.331 --> 01:04:14.022
Fuck saving the world.

01:04:25.447 --> 01:04:26.793
What the fuck?

01:04:28.934 --> 01:04:29.934
Guys, stop!

01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:31.453
Ah!

01:04:31.488 --> 01:04:32.385
Please!

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.628
You're trying to sedate me?

01:04:33.662 --> 01:04:34.905
Huh?

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.814
You're fucking trying to
sedate me, motherfucker?

01:04:36.838 --> 01:04:39.772
You're trying to fucking
sedate me, motherfucker!

01:04:39.806 --> 01:04:41.532
With a fucking needle!

01:04:41.567 --> 01:04:42.637
What are you doing!?

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:43.914
I did it for us!

01:04:43.949 --> 01:04:44.742
I did it for us!
The fuck you did it for us!

01:04:44.777 --> 01:04:45.985
I did it for us!

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:46.813
You did what for
us motherfucker?!

01:04:46.848 --> 01:04:48.263
I did it for us!

01:04:49.782 --> 01:04:52.474
I need to fix this, please,
I really need to fix this.

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:57.030
I need to fix us.

01:05:13.771 --> 01:05:16.982
That's what this has
been all about hasn't it?

01:05:21.124 --> 01:05:23.022
You're not trying
to save the world,

01:05:24.506 --> 01:05:29.201
you're just trying to fix
your crazy fucking brain.

01:05:31.686 --> 01:05:36.691
No, no.

01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:42.869
There have been
others, haven't there?

01:05:50.256 --> 01:05:54.433
You are the human problem.

01:06:07.998 --> 01:06:08.998
Fuck.

01:07:08.334 --> 01:07:11.717
Neurochemicals spill and flood,

01:07:11.751 --> 01:07:15.341
trillions of synapses
fire in sync in chaos.

01:07:17.619 --> 01:07:20.553
You're an animal, at the mercy

01:07:20.588 --> 01:07:24.143
of your unforgiving,
unrelenting brain.

01:07:26.732 --> 01:07:31.668
Every moment and every second,
every ounce of sensation

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.810
is felt one place
and one place only.

01:07:38.882 --> 01:07:40.539
Right up here.

01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:46.371
This is God.

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:49.858
This is who you pray to.

01:07:52.344 --> 01:07:53.862
This is whose mercy you're at.

01:07:56.486 --> 01:08:01.422
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:08:03.355 --> 01:08:08.360
- Want to go again?
- Yes.

01:08:24.617 --> 01:08:25.791
Oh, what the fuck?

01:08:25.825 --> 01:08:26.825
You okay?

01:08:32.487 --> 01:08:33.832
What the fuck?

01:08:41.462 --> 01:08:42.462
Fuck you.

01:08:48.054 --> 01:08:51.541
Aren't you curious
how I found you?

01:08:55.027 --> 01:08:56.201
My friends are coming.

01:09:00.032 --> 01:09:03.863
It wasn't your hacker friend
if that's what you think.

01:09:03.898 --> 01:09:04.898
What was his name?

01:09:07.591 --> 01:09:11.560
Sun Moon.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.356
So very brave.

01:09:17.082 --> 01:09:18.671
Fuck you!

01:09:18.706 --> 01:09:19.706
Fuck you!

01:09:33.272 --> 01:09:35.964
What can I do to help?

01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:43.212
Tell me, do you believe
mankind to be a vile creature?

01:09:49.287 --> 01:09:52.947
You have the headset, what
more do you want from me?

01:09:55.156 --> 01:09:59.954
I want to know, what we are?

01:10:12.863 --> 01:10:15.107
I don't know what we are.

01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:19.491
And therein lies
the human problem.

01:10:22.908 --> 01:10:25.635
We don't know what we
are and in an effort

01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:30.674
to answer that question we
destroy everything around us.

01:10:35.714 --> 01:10:36.818
Can you imagine?

01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:40.270
A world without human beings?

01:10:44.861 --> 01:10:45.861
You can't.

01:10:46.759 --> 01:10:47.759
Oh I can.

01:10:49.797 --> 01:10:52.351
You can't because my
machine is broken, you freak.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:55.848
If you're referring
to the broken processor,

01:10:55.872 --> 01:10:58.357
I have since replaced
it with mine.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:02.879
With a single mental virus,

01:11:04.329 --> 01:11:09.057
I will recreate the garden
before the filth of mankind.

01:11:12.095 --> 01:11:15.271
Tell me, how does
it feel to know

01:11:17.342 --> 01:11:19.033
that your mind will be my map?

01:11:47.268 --> 01:11:50.064
Finn, what the fuck is going on?

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:51.134
Finn?

01:11:51.168 --> 01:11:52.515
Finn, let me help you!

01:11:59.867 --> 01:12:00.902
Someone will kill you.

01:12:00.937 --> 01:12:04.734
No, I will die by my own hands.

01:12:10.981 --> 01:12:15.503
The loneliest man
that ever lived.

01:12:32.589 --> 01:12:33.383
Shit!

01:12:33.418 --> 01:12:34.418
Shit!

01:12:47.915 --> 01:12:48.847
Mason!

01:12:48.881 --> 01:12:50.400
Mason, are you okay?

01:12:50.435 --> 01:12:51.677
Scissors?

01:12:51.712 --> 01:12:52.575
Scissors!

01:12:52.609 --> 01:12:53.609
Top.

01:13:09.557 --> 01:13:10.557
Headset!

01:13:11.766 --> 01:13:12.766
Go!

01:13:33.857 --> 01:13:35.963
Oh, god!

01:13:35.997 --> 01:13:37.343
What can I do?

01:13:56.708 --> 01:13:59.055
You are the human problem.

01:14:00.539 --> 01:14:01.539
Mason.

01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:05.268
I'm the human problem.

01:14:05.302 --> 01:14:06.302
Mason!

01:14:13.794 --> 01:14:15.174
What was happening back there?

01:14:15.209 --> 01:14:16.313
Who was that?

01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:21.077
What was he doing to you?

01:14:22.009 --> 01:14:23.009
He was...

01:14:25.081 --> 01:14:28.843
Was he uploading your mind?

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:37.265
My mind.

01:14:38.543 --> 01:14:43.548
He has my mind.

01:14:47.552 --> 01:14:49.899
He has my mind!

01:14:49.933 --> 01:14:50.831
What are you talking about?

01:14:50.865 --> 01:14:52.349
I must, I need to fix us!

01:14:52.384 --> 01:14:53.384
Who?

01:14:54.662 --> 01:14:56.043
Everything!

01:14:56.077 --> 01:14:57.251
Everything what?

01:14:57.285 --> 01:15:00.254
- The human problem!
- You can't fix people!

01:15:01.738 --> 01:15:04.361
No machine is gonna save us.

01:15:07.088 --> 01:15:09.194
We are the solution.

01:15:12.059 --> 01:15:13.992
The solution is within.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.973
He needs me.

01:15:30.802 --> 01:15:31.802
Who?

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.700
Mason, who?

01:15:40.915 --> 01:15:43.815
Sawyer, I can't
let you get hurt.

01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:51.063
What are you doing?

01:15:56.275 --> 01:15:57.518
I can help you!

01:16:14.466 --> 01:16:15.466
Mason!

01:16:18.435 --> 01:16:21.093
You don't have to do this alone.

01:16:22.508 --> 01:16:23.508
Mason!

01:16:56.370 --> 01:17:00.477
Well, kids, we're live.

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:02.894
My name is Mason.

01:17:04.689 --> 01:17:06.898
Tonight I'll be performing
my last ever jam.

01:17:08.693 --> 01:17:12.973
Breaking into my own lab,
to save my best friend.

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:20.877
If I don't make it, burn
333 Willow to the ground.

01:18:58.457 --> 01:19:01.150
Where's my fucking friend!

01:19:01.184 --> 01:19:04.360
- Where's my headset?
- In fucking pieces, you shit!

01:19:05.533 --> 01:19:08.191
Then the last
moments of your life

01:19:08.226 --> 01:19:09.745
will be filled with agony.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:47.852
Finn, wait.

01:19:52.408 --> 01:19:53.478
Finn, please!

01:19:54.341 --> 01:19:57.585
Finn, look, I'm sorry!

01:19:58.828 --> 01:20:00.278
God!

01:20:00.312 --> 01:20:01.312
Oh, God!

01:20:11.185 --> 01:20:15.189
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please.

01:20:21.057 --> 01:20:22.714
Please you don't
have to do this!

01:20:22.748 --> 01:20:24.371
You don't have to do this, Finn!

01:20:36.521 --> 01:20:37.521
I'm sorry.

01:20:39.938 --> 01:20:43.010
With your mind I
will live forever.

01:20:44.529 --> 01:20:50.569
With your mind I
will kill mankind.

01:21:56.256 --> 01:22:00.950
Finn, I'm sorry for everything.

01:22:03.988 --> 01:22:07.301
I'm sorry I was...
Never a true friend.

01:24:23.713 --> 01:24:24.713
Mason!

01:24:33.482 --> 01:24:34.482
Wow.

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.281
We did it.

01:25:08.793 --> 01:25:11.106
How did I ever get so lucky?

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:12.900
Vix?

01:25:12.935 --> 01:25:13.935
You good?

01:25:14.626 --> 01:25:16.076
Check this out.

01:25:17.974 --> 01:25:20.529
Vix, we're here for you, Vix.

01:25:23.394 --> 01:25:24.981
Got you, brother.
