00:24.875 --> 00:28.125
If this is about Winky's Cantina,
I didn't have anything to do with it.

00:28.208 --> 00:30.416
[man 2] It's not about Winky's Cantina.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.375

00:35.541 --> 00:37.083

00:47.625 --> 00:50.250
"Bubblicious Watermelon Wave."
What do you say?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.375
There is no other kind.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.041
If you think I'm gonna rat somebody out
for Bubblicious,

01:01.125 --> 01:03.000

You got a long way to go, son.

01:19.666 --> 01:22.166
There's an upside
to sleeping so close to your toilet.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.000
I get it. You're glib.

01:24.833 --> 01:26.583
Well, I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

01:26.666 --> 01:29.875
My name is Donald Fitzroy,

You're gonna commute my sentence?

01:32.333 --> 01:33.750
-[Fitzroy] Yes.
-Just like that?

When I get out of this chair
and walk out of this prison,

01:36.083 --> 01:36.916
you'll walk with me.

Who are you,

01:39.625 --> 01:41.250
No offense,
I thought you'd look different.

01:41.333 --> 01:42.583
I may be. We'll see.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.458
What's the catch?

You work for us.

01:47.958 --> 01:50.291
-[Gentry] Who's "us"?
-The CIA.

01:50.875 --> 01:52.666
We're gonna train you to kill bad guys.

01:53.166 --> 01:56.250
And since you've already killed one,
it shouldn't be too difficult.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.791
What makes you think I wanna do it again?

01:58.875 --> 02:00.625
You seem like the type.

02:02.416 --> 02:05.625
You'd be part of an elite unit,
the Sierra program.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.791
You would exist in the gray.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Disposable?

02:11.666 --> 02:14.625
I've studied your case.
I know why you pulled that trigger.

02:14.708 --> 02:16.708
I would've done the same thing myself.

02:17.291 --> 02:21.500
Now, I'm here to help you become
a value-add instead of a value lost.

02:21.583 --> 02:24.541
So why don't you take all the pain
or whatever the hell got you here,

02:24.625 --> 02:27.166
turn it around, and make it useful?

02:31.541 --> 02:33.250
How long do I gotta work for you?

02:34.125 --> 02:36.875

We need him eliminated before

05:45.875 --> 05:46.708
[Six] Understood.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.250
Please explain to me
why I'm talking to a Sierra agent

in our circle of trust.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.083
We're Romeo.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.208
He said he was Sierra.

12:42.291 --> 12:44.083
That wasn't in the mission folder.

12:44.708 --> 12:46.083
He knew who I was.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.125
[agent] Maybe he had access
to stolen intel.

12:50.875 --> 12:52.333
I'm Sierra. There is no intel.

[Dawson] No joy. I repeat, no joy.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.458
[Denny] This is why I wanted
the Sierra program made extinct.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.041
I want nothing left from that old regime.

That doesn't qualify as an explanation.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.541
[Six] Maybe on a secure line.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.208
I need a status report.

Insecure line.

14:19.583 --> 14:22.041
Did the target say anything to you?

14:22.125 --> 14:23.083
Well, he was dead,

14:23.666 --> 14:25.958
so, you know, no.

14:26.041 --> 14:29.708
What about pocket litter?
Did you get anything off his body?

14:32.333 --> 14:36.000
Six, did he have anything on his person

14:36.750 --> 14:40.791
that you now have
that you'd like to give to me?

14:42.000 --> 14:42.833
Who was he?

14:44.041 --> 14:45.083
A bad guy.

at the opera house.

1:11:18.833 --> 1:11:20.583
We're going to prison for this.

1:11:20.666 --> 1:11:22.583
Keep any more cops out of that square.

1:11:22.666 --> 1:11:25.041
We're killing cops now?

1:12:24.750 --> 1:12:28.625
Would someone mind shooting
the man handcuffed to the bench?

1:12:28.708 --> 1:12:30.000
[mercenary] We can't get to him.

1:12:31.166 --> 1:12:32.583

1:13:49.500 --> 1:13:51.416
The relay antenna must have snapped off.

1:13:53.416 --> 1:13:54.500
Well, get it back on

1:18:20.750 --> 1:18:24.291
This is quite possibly
the most spectacular failure

1:18:24.916 --> 1:18:26.875
in the history of covert ops.

1:18:28.791 --> 1:18:32.541
This will be taught in schools
as the primary example

No change, Lone Wolf.

1:19:14.791 --> 1:19:16.541
I mean, my ego's a little bruised.

1:19:17.041 --> 1:19:19.708
I would like the opportunity
to save you at some point.

1:19:20.833 --> 1:19:23.125
Not that I want you to be in danger
so I can save you.

1:19:23.208 --> 1:19:25.875
-You said they have a girl.
-Yeah.

1:19:26.500 --> 1:19:27.458

Can you please get us a doctor?
My husband's injured.

You know, you have ten fingers.

1:20:22.083 --> 1:20:24.833
Yeah, and a few cans of pepper spray
in my eyes.

1:20:24.916 --> 1:20:29.583
And you can't all caps on this thing.
You have to control shift. It's a process.

1:20:32.791 --> 1:20:33.708

She's in Croatia.

1:20:35.666 --> 1:20:37.208
I mean, I can see that.

1:20:38.291 --> 1:20:39.666
It's not in Croatian.

1:20:40.166 --> 1:20:42.625

[Lone Wolf] That's him,
the man from the square.

1:23:39.416 --> 1:23:40.625
[Six] You were in my shot.

1:23:41.208 --> 1:23:42.958
You gave me an empty gun?

1:23:43.791 --> 1:23:45.625
-[Six] The shells were coming, okay?
-Huh?

1:23:45.708 --> 1:23:47.916
The shells were coming.
You… You ran away too fast.

1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.333
[Miranda] Then you need to say,
"Hey, wait! That's empty."

1:23:50.416 --> 1:23:51.375
No, it's assumed.

1:23:51.458 --> 1:23:54.333
I assumed it's loaded,
so I ran after the guy.

1:23:54.416 --> 1:23:56.875
-Who throws a loaded gun?
-I asked for a loaded gun.

1:23:56.958 --> 1:24:00.666

Are you coming?

[growls, sighs]

1:24:02.625 --> 1:24:04.666
I'm gonna bleed out
while we have this conversation.

Can we just unpack this somewhere else?

[Denny, over phone]
Jesus Christ, Suzanne!

1:24:14.458 --> 1:24:15.291
I warned you.

1:24:15.375 --> 1:24:17.375
When I said, "Sit on Lloyd,"
I meant sit on him,

1:24:17.458 --> 1:24:18.625
not "torch half of Europe."

1:24:18.708 --> 1:24:20.833
-He is unsittable.
-Do you have the drive?

1:24:20.916 --> 1:24:22.583
Not in possession. No, it's en route.

1:24:22.666 --> 1:24:23.625
What about Six?

1:24:23.708 --> 1:24:25.625
Bleeding and MIA.

1:24:26.291 --> 1:24:28.750
-Have you heard from the old man?
-No, not yet.

1:24:28.833 --> 1:24:32.875
Doesn't mean he doesn't know.
"Prague on fire" is hard to keep a lid on.

1:24:32.958 --> 1:24:34.125
What are you gonna tell him?

1:24:34.208 --> 1:24:35.541
The truth, Suzanne.

1:24:35.625 --> 1:24:37.458
That you hired Lloyd Hansen?

1:24:37.541 --> 1:24:39.875
That truth or some other truth?

1:24:39.958 --> 1:24:41.625

Amateur.

1:25:23.375 --> 1:25:24.541
Why'd you go to prison?

1:25:25.416 --> 1:25:26.458
Why do you ask?

1:25:26.958 --> 1:25:28.000
'Cause I wanna know.

1:25:29.125 --> 1:25:31.250
[Six] Will it affect
whether you help me or not?

1:25:31.333 --> 1:25:32.291
[Miranda] Maybe.

1:25:32.375 --> 1:25:33.500
That's fair enough.

1:25:35.083 --> 1:25:36.875
What is this, puppy mouthwash?

1:25:38.625 --> 1:25:39.500
[grunts]

1:25:40.583 --> 1:25:41.708
Okay.

1:25:43.208 --> 1:25:44.166
[panting]

1:25:47.375 --> 1:25:48.375
[groans]

1:25:49.041 --> 1:25:50.958
Well… [sniffs]

1:25:52.375 --> 1:25:55.666
…my father fancied himself
a real macho man.

1:25:58.166 --> 1:26:03.958
And he was hell-bent on turning me
and my brother into the same.

1:26:08.666 --> 1:26:11.750
Unfortunately, his methods
were a little unsound,

1:26:13.208 --> 1:26:14.208
and, uh…

1:26:15.916 --> 1:26:20.125
he started laying into my brother so hard

1:26:21.291 --> 1:26:22.833
that at a certain point,

1:26:23.916 --> 1:26:26.416
it was clear
it was either gonna be my brother or him.

1:26:26.708 --> 1:26:28.291
[muffled shouting and thuds]

1:26:28.375 --> 1:26:29.291
So…

1:26:30.500 --> 1:26:32.125
[man, shouting]
You think you can do it without me?

1:26:32.208 --> 1:26:33.625
You can't!

1:26:35.166 --> 1:26:36.708
I decided it would be him.

1:26:37.625 --> 1:26:39.625
[soft pensive music plays]

1:26:41.208 --> 1:26:44.125
I thought, "How noble of me,"

1:26:45.208 --> 1:26:49.125
and, uh,
everyone else thought I should be in jail.

1:26:53.791 --> 1:26:56.208
And that's the way it was
until Fitzroy found me.

1:26:59.541 --> 1:27:01.541
-[clicks]
-[air hisses]

1:27:05.541 --> 1:27:06.458

1:27:08.208 --> 1:27:09.750
[exhales]

1:27:11.708 --> 1:27:12.583
That's better.

1:27:18.125 --> 1:27:19.291
So what do you say?

1:27:22.666 --> 1:27:24.125
We gonna do this or not?

1:27:24.916 --> 1:27:26.916
[helicopter passing overhead]

1:27:31.625 --> 1:27:33.041
He's coming for us, isn't he?

1:27:34.041 --> 1:27:37.500
If he can walk, honey, it'll be
through those double doors over there.

1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000
[menacing instrumental theme plays]

1:27:48.708 --> 1:27:51.250
-[typing]
-[pilot] Vehicle on approach.

1:27:51.333 --> 1:27:52.250
Let him in.

1:27:58.125 --> 1:27:59.208
Alpha one, clear.

1:28:08.291 --> 1:28:10.291
Bravo un, rien à signaler.

1:28:13.333 --> 1:28:14.583
Charles trois, clear.

1:28:20.791 --> 1:28:22.375
[Lloyd] You know what I love about you?

1:28:22.458 --> 1:28:26.041
You look like you've been hit by a bus,
but it only adds to your mystique.

1:28:28.500 --> 1:28:29.500
[exhales]

1:28:31.500 --> 1:28:32.500
Yahtzee.

1:28:34.333 --> 1:28:36.333
[helicopter blades thumping]

1:28:38.375 --> 1:28:40.083
Secteur cinq, RAS.

1:28:42.208 --> 1:28:43.708
-Alors ?
-[mercenary] Tout est en place.

1:28:43.791 --> 1:28:46.000
-Eh, à cause de--
-[Six] You guys looking for me?

1:28:47.291 --> 1:28:48.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:28:48.541 --> 1:28:49.625
Bouge pas ! Bouge pas !

1:28:49.708 --> 1:28:50.791
À genoux !

1:28:50.875 --> 1:28:52.416
All right, all right, you got me.

1:28:52.500 --> 1:28:54.750
-[mercenary] Mets-toi à genoux !
-Quick question.

1:28:55.708 --> 1:28:56.916
You a 42 regular?

1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:59.666
-[silenced gunshots]
-[grunting]

1:29:03.875 --> 1:29:06.291
[Miranda] If you're gonna take his gun,
make sure it's loaded.

1:29:14.625 --> 1:29:15.708
I get the big one.

1:29:19.916 --> 1:29:20.750
It's loading.

1:29:23.458 --> 1:29:26.458
Tell me, Suzanne, is there any other part
of your job that I can do for you?

1:29:26.541 --> 1:29:29.125
Failing upwards
does not qualify as success.

1:29:29.208 --> 1:29:31.458
No, success qualifies as success.

1:29:31.541 --> 1:29:34.791
Do you consider putting a bullet
in the girl upstairs a success?

1:29:34.875 --> 1:29:37.708
'Cause I'm struggling to see
how you're gonna get out of all this.

1:29:37.791 --> 1:29:40.041
You wanna make an omelet,
you gotta kill some people.

1:29:40.708 --> 1:29:41.708
You're killing a girl?

1:29:46.750 --> 1:29:49.583
You know, in English,
we call this a happy ending.

1:29:49.666 --> 1:29:53.416
However, if you say one more word,
you may not see it that way.

1:29:53.500 --> 1:29:57.041
Suzanne, please pay my Tamil friend
and send him on his way.

1:29:57.125 --> 1:29:58.666
Who's on the east perimeter?

1:29:59.166 --> 1:30:00.166
[tech 2] Unit five.

1:30:01.333 --> 1:30:02.250
Where are they?

1:30:02.333 --> 1:30:03.875
They were there two minutes ago.

1:30:06.875 --> 1:30:07.791
Get the genny up.

1:30:15.208 --> 1:30:16.875
[booming]

1:30:27.250 --> 1:30:28.250
Lock everything down.

1:30:28.833 --> 1:30:30.208
All units to the courtyard.

1:30:31.833 --> 1:30:33.958
And do not pay this asshole.

1:30:34.041 --> 1:30:35.708
[rapid gunfire outside]

1:30:40.583 --> 1:30:43.375

Intrusion. Intrusion.

1:30:53.083 --> 1:30:54.166
[Claire] What's happening?

1:30:54.250 --> 1:30:55.916
I told you to stay over there, please.

1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:57.458
-[Claire] What's going on?
-[gunfire]

1:30:57.541 --> 1:30:58.916
Under the bed, quick!

1:31:29.708 --> 1:31:30.541
Fitz.

1:31:30.625 --> 1:31:32.375
Get me eyes on the bridge.

1:31:32.458 --> 1:31:33.916
[rocket fires, whistles]

1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:34.916
[man] Ahh!

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.291
[laughs appreciatively]

1:31:47.416 --> 1:31:49.500
He's trying to draw us away. Shit!

1:31:50.083 --> 1:31:50.958
You able?

1:31:51.583 --> 1:31:55.208
Well, I can walk, but, uh, missing a wing.

1:31:57.083 --> 1:31:59.166
-Can you wiggle your finger?
-With this wing.

1:32:00.250 --> 1:32:02.000
[Six] That'll do. You okay?

1:32:04.541 --> 1:32:06.000
Took you long enough.

1:32:06.875 --> 1:32:10.500
-Sorry about that. My flight was delayed.
-[Fitzroy] I knew you'd catch another one.

1:32:10.583 --> 1:32:12.041
[floorboards creaking]

1:32:14.375 --> 1:32:15.916

You ready?

1:32:29.541 --> 1:32:31.500
[Miranda panting]

1:32:48.916 --> 1:32:50.000
He's in the house.

1:32:53.083 --> 1:32:54.416
Morons!

1:33:02.541 --> 1:33:04.750
-Put a gun on that door.
-[man 2] Roger that.

1:33:05.958 --> 1:33:08.041
-[tech 2] Check the network.
-[tech] It's unresponsive.

1:33:10.375 --> 1:33:12.083
[tech 2] Get the cameras back on.

1:33:14.958 --> 1:33:16.791
I had to reboot the system.

1:33:16.875 --> 1:33:19.000
-[tech] Mine is not rebooting.

1:33:41.416 --> 1:33:43.416
[men yelling in the distance]

1:33:44.208 --> 1:33:45.875
Do you have a plan, or are we improvising?

1:33:45.958 --> 1:33:48.125
Yeah, I got a plan.
You got your swim trunks?

-[Fitzroy grunts]

1:33:53.208 --> 1:33:54.208
[Fitzroy] Go, go, go.

1:33:55.333 --> 1:33:58.000
-Down. Down low.
-[Claire gasps]

1:33:58.083 --> 1:34:01.250
You're making me destroy
a historic building here!

1:34:01.333 --> 1:34:03.000
All right. Let's get ready to jump.

1:34:03.083 --> 1:34:05.625
-I'm gonna have to take the stairs.
-What are you talking about?

1:34:05.708 --> 1:34:06.958
[wheezes]

1:34:07.041 --> 1:34:08.708
-[Claire sobbing]
-[Fitzroy] Not good.

1:34:08.791 --> 1:34:11.125
-What the hell is that?
-What do you think it is?

-Go, Six. Get her out of here.

[Fitzroy] Take the gun.
Give me the grenade.

-Let me see it. Put some pressure on it.
-[Fitzroy mutters]

1:34:28.125 --> 1:34:30.583
Get the damn gun out of my face.
Shut up. I need to think.

1:34:30.666 --> 1:34:32.125
You don't have time to think.

1:34:32.208 --> 1:34:33.875
Six, look at me. Look at me.

1:34:33.958 --> 1:34:34.875
I'm out.

1:34:34.958 --> 1:34:36.125
Get her gone.

1:34:37.291 --> 1:34:40.958
Take this. Give me a hand grenade.
You understand me? Go!

[Claire whimpers]

1:34:47.166 --> 1:34:49.333
-Come on.
-You go with Six, baby.

1:34:49.416 --> 1:34:51.666
-[Six] We go in three, two, one.
-[Claire] No, wait!

-He's bleeding. Oh, my God!
-[Six] Come on.

1:34:55.041 --> 1:34:56.583
-I love you. Go with Six.
-No!

1:34:56.666 --> 1:34:58.750
-Not you too!
-Go, go, go, go. Take her.

1:34:58.833 --> 1:35:00.958
-It's okay.
-[Claire] No. Six, stop!

1:35:01.041 --> 1:35:02.750
Stop it! Stop!

1:35:03.500 --> 1:35:04.750
[Claire sobbing] Six, please!

1:35:05.458 --> 1:35:06.916
Oh, for Chrissakes.

1:35:48.625 --> 1:35:49.625
[Lloyd] Roll him.

-You douche.

1:37:23.333 --> 1:37:24.250
Take it.

1:37:25.041 --> 1:37:26.916
I don't care about the money anymore.

1:37:28.833 --> 1:37:31.458
These are not honorable people. Take it.

[shouts] Shoot him!

1:38:27.458 --> 1:38:30.125
[grunts, gasps] Wait. Please don't shoot.

1:38:31.041 --> 1:38:33.916
Look what you did to my hand.
Give me that, you little shit.

1:39:27.541 --> 1:39:30.416
Now you pick those feet up,
or you're gonna get dead real quick.

1:39:43.708 --> 1:39:44.875
[panting] Now, listen.

1:39:46.166 --> 1:39:48.666
You shut up, and you don't move.

[Claire] Six!

1:40:27.541 --> 1:40:30.000
[Lloyd] Now, I'm gonna stop you
right there, cupcake.

1:40:30.583 --> 1:40:31.916
What do you say we wrap this up?

1:40:32.500 --> 1:40:33.791
I mean, I'm having a blast,

1:40:34.375 --> 1:40:36.833
but it's way past the kid's bedtime,
don't you think?

1:40:37.458 --> 1:40:40.708
Keep him talking. I have line of sight.

1:40:41.291 --> 1:40:45.625
You're gonna throw me that gun,
or the little one gets a new face.

1:40:46.583 --> 1:40:49.291
If your strategy relies
on whether or not I'll kill a child,

1:40:49.375 --> 1:40:50.791
you need a new strategy.

1:40:51.791 --> 1:40:53.416
[screams]

1:40:53.500 --> 1:40:56.666
[Claire sobbing]

1:41:00.291 --> 1:41:02.750
Cute. I meant with the bullets.
