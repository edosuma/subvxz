PROBABLY THINKS
A RESCUE MISSION'S TOO RISKY.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.591
THE POSITION AND SIZE
OF THEIR MILITIA
MAY BE OVERWHELMING.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.628
- HE'S WORRIED ABOUT CASUALTIES.
- 4-1 AIN'T GOOD CALCULUS.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.497
YEAH, ONLY HE DOESN'T KNOW
YOU AND I ARE ROLLING
AS A TWO-PIECE.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.300
WHICH IS EVEN MORE REASON
TO SET UP THE WHEEL AND DEAL.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.136
WHICH YOU CAN'T DO WITHOUT
A SIGN-OFF FROM WASHINGTON.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.840
WHO SAYS THAT NOW?

12:52.873 --> 12:58.345
WE'RE NOT WAITING ON SOME
PENCIL NECK TO COME AROUND
AND PART THE RED SEA.

12:58.378 --> 13:02.182
I GOT INTEL TO PRINT US UP
A TRANSFER DOC FOR
SIMON DASHA JUST IN CASE.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.584
IS THAT GONNA FLY
AT A C.I.A. SUMMER CAMP?

13:04.617 --> 13:07.087
LONG ENOUGH TO GET OUR
BARGAINING CHIP IN HAND.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.490
BY THE TIME THEY REALIZE
IT'S FORGED, WE'LL HAVE DASHA
BACK IN HIS CELL.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.759
SO BE IT.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.028
[ Krinsman ]
IF YOUR MAN HAD PULLED
OFF THIS MISSION--

13:15.062 --> 13:18.665
MY MAN WAS SENT IN--
BUT IF HE HAD SUCCEEDED,
I WOULDN'T HAVE THE FALLOUT.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.868
MR. KRINSMAN,
I CONCERN MYSELF WITH SHOOTERS,
NOT POLITICS.

13:20.901 --> 13:24.337
AND I HAVE A MAN
THAT'S IN THE HANDS OF A MILITIA
THAT WANTS TO BARTER.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.139
PART OF THE QUID PRO QUO
INVOLVES THE UNITED STATES...

13:26.173 --> 13:29.276
WITHDRAWING FROM
THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.279
BOTH SIDES KNOW THAT
WON'T HAPPEN, WHICH IS WHY
I NEED SIMON DASHA RELEASED.

13:32.312 --> 13:37.017
I'VE GOT TWO MEN
ON THE WAY DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S A BIT PREMATURE.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.720
- FAT'S IN THE FIRE, SIR.
- C.I.A. HASN'T EVEN
DOWNLOADED DASHA YET.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.857
HE HASN'T TALKED IN SIX MONTHS.
HE AIN'T GONNA TALK.
HE'S A CLOSED BOOK.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.726
THERE'S A "SELL BY" DATE
FOR TERRORISTS?

13:46.759 --> 13:50.630
LOOK. I KNOW YOU
FEEL BURNED BY THAT
LATIN-AMERICAN THING.

13:50.663 --> 13:54.301
BUT HERE'S MY APPEAL.
TAKE IT OUT ON MY CAREER.
NOT ON MY MAN.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.837
COLONEL, I'M TRYING TO
PUT THIS NICE. WHAT YOU DESIRE
AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.806
THEN HOW DO I
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

13:59.839 --> 14:03.543
I WILL NOT AUTHORIZE
THE RELEASE OF A MAN
THAT DEPRAVED.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.646
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
THAT EVIL CAN COME BACK
AND BITE US ALL.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.848
THEN DON'T RELEASE HIM
PERMANENTLY.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.018
WHAT?

14:11.051 --> 14:14.087
GIVE HIM A FURLOUGH.
LET ME USE HIM AS A DECOY
TO GET MY MAN BACK.

14:14.121 --> 14:17.657
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
I'M LISTENING
FOR YOUR OBJECTIONS.

14:17.690 --> 14:21.061
WHAT IF HE GETS AWAY?
I TRUST THAT MY MEN WILL
SEE TO IT THAT HE DOESN'T.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.830
I NEED SOMETHING
MORE THAN FAITH.
MR. KRINSMAN,

14:23.863 --> 14:27.000
RIGHT NOW THIS SITUATION
IS CONTAINED--
NO ONE KNOWS.

14:27.034 --> 14:30.837
IF WE DON'T AT LEAST APPEAR TO
PLAY BALL WITH THIS GROUP,
THAT TAPE GOES PUBLIC.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.441
IT'S NOT US. IT'S THEM
THAT BROUGHT IT PUBLIC.
THINGS GET HOT FOR US ALL.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.710
THEN WE PLAY CATCH-UP.
YOUR BOSS AND THE MAN
THAT SITS IN THE CHAIR...

14:37.744 --> 14:40.047
AT THE WHITE HOUSE IS GONNA
HAVE TO REACT TO SAVE FACE.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.582
NOW'S THE TIME
TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE.
MY WAY DON'T WORK,

14:42.615 --> 14:46.053
YOU GOT YOUR EXCUSE
YOU'RE ITCHING FOR
TO CAN MY ASS.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.756
YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF GALL, FELLA.
THEY'VE GOT MY FRIEND, SIR.

14:49.789 --> 14:53.060
I'M PERFECTLY CONTENT
TO HAVE YOU AS AN ENEMY.
LET'S PLAY THAT LATER.

14:53.093 --> 14:56.396

IS MY WAY WILL WORK.

AND GIVE ME THE BUCKET.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.619
DON'T YOU CALL ME
THAT AGAIN.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.991
HE'S BEGGING ME
FOR FOOD.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.926

16:21.414 --> 16:24.017

WOULD'VE WORKED.
I'M SURE IT WOULD'VE.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.953

WHERE THE GOOD LORD FLUNG IT.

WELCOME TO FACILITY 17.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.166
LET'S HEAR IT.
THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN PLAN.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.301
KRINSMAN CONFIRMED THE DEAL.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.372
AND WHEN DASHA FOUND OUT YOU
SPECIAL FORCES TYPE WAS COMING
FOR HIM, HE STARTED TALKING.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.374
AND HE'S SINGING
LIKE JULIE ANDREWS.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.409
HOW THE HELL DID HE KNOW
WE WERE COMING?

16:49.442 --> 16:53.080
I'M NOT AT ALL SURE THAT
THAT'S NOT ABOVE YOUR PAY GRADE.

16:55.615 --> 17:00.087
BUT HE'S NOT MOVING ONE INCH
UNTIL WE GET EVERY PIECE OF
INFORMATION THAT HE'LL DISCLOSE.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.190

WERE PLAYING PATTY-CAKE
WITH HIM FOR SIX MONTHS.

17:03.223 --> 17:06.059
NOW HE WANTS TO SING
'CAUSE HE'S AFRAID OF
THE SPECIAL FORCES?

17:06.093 --> 17:09.529

A MORE RESPECTFUL MANNER.

17:09.562 --> 17:13.066

YOU SCREWED US!

17:27.147 --> 17:29.549

17:29.582 --> 17:32.185

OF MY MEN PICKING UP DASHA
TO GET HIM TO TALK.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.187
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
THE POINT IS...

17:34.221 --> 17:38.258

NEEDS TO GO DOWN NOW, NOW, NOW!

17:38.291 --> 17:41.928

WILL ENGAGE IN HIGH-LEVEL TALKS.

HAVE HIM. HOW'S CHATTING

FOR SENDING ME THIS BREAD.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.160

- THERE'S WISDOM TO BE FOUND

- YOU KNOW THE KORAN.
- WANT TO TALK
RELIGION, DIMA?

TO TALK RELIGION WITH YOU.

DO WE TRUST CHARLOTTE?
WELL, UP TO THIS POINT,
NOTHING SHE SAID HAS BEEN WRONG.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.661

IS PUT YOU FRONT AND CENTER
OF THIS WHOLE MESS.

19:21.694 --> 19:25.198
WELL, IF HER FRIEND,
MR. CHAMBERS, CAN KEEP ME
OUT OF JAIL, THEN I VOTE FOR IT.

19:25.232 --> 19:28.301

19:28.335 --> 19:30.503

19:30.537 --> 19:33.373

WANT ME, AND IT SEEMS THEY DO,

OH, NO. DON'T TELL ME.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.686

- WHAT IS TRUE?

25:01.701 --> 25:05.672

TOO POLITE TO ASK.
