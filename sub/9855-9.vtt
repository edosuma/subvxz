00:18.626 --> 00:20.093
Hey!

00:47.739 --> 00:49.406
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:49.441 --> 00:51.342
Do you want a coffee?

00:51.376 --> 00:55.913
No. I need to get moving
as quickly as possible.

00:55.947 --> 00:58.015
What do you need them to think?

01:00.685 --> 01:02.820
That there is no pressure
on Dimitrov at all.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.254
Will they believe that?

01:04.289 --> 01:05.254
No.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.191
Never.

01:07.225 --> 01:08.325
But they will believe

01:08.360 --> 01:09.393
that I am looking for him

01:09.427 --> 01:10.761
in the wrong place.

01:10.795 --> 01:11.895
Is he still in Moscow?

01:11.930 --> 01:15.299
No, he's about
190 kilometers south, near Tula.

01:15.419 --> 01:17.901
Where do you want him
to think you are?

01:17.936 --> 01:21.238
He has a rather
large presence in Poland,

01:21.272 --> 01:23.007
so it's logical
for me to be there,

01:23.041 --> 01:25.709
and I have numerous
contacts in Warsaw

01:25.744 --> 01:27.878
who will help sell the ruse.

01:27.912 --> 01:29.213
Would you actually go there?

01:29.247 --> 01:30.180
Yes, of course,

01:30.215 --> 01:31.782
and then I will go underground,

01:31.816 --> 01:35.819
but anyone who is watching me
would believe I am still there.

01:35.854 --> 01:39.290
So, I will say we spoke,

01:39.324 --> 01:40.691
that you are going to Warsaw

01:40.725 --> 01:42.293
and to follow...

01:42.327 --> 01:44.228
Yeah, but be careful.

01:44.262 --> 01:46.964
Small talk.

01:46.998 --> 01:49.366
Just a couple having breakfast.

01:49.401 --> 01:50.467
Talk about the...

01:50.502 --> 01:52.534
Michel, we know how
to talk to each other.

01:54.039 --> 01:55.806
Of course.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.908
But you must explain

01:57.943 --> 02:00.211
that you are moving
to the Amsterdam apartment,

02:00.245 --> 02:01.712
that you are leaving
the French flat empty.

02:01.746 --> 02:04.882
How will we know if it works?

02:04.916 --> 02:06.350
It will.

02:06.384 --> 02:07.869
What if it doesn't?

02:07.989 --> 02:09.419
It will.

02:19.364 --> 02:21.065
Shari isn't there.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.101
She never came home.

02:24.135 --> 02:25.903
Do you have
any idea where she went?

02:25.937 --> 02:28.772
Said she was going by you.

02:30.875 --> 02:33.243
Well, if... if you see her,

02:33.278 --> 02:34.745
would you tell her
that I came by?

02:34.779 --> 02:36.380
Sure.

02:46.558 --> 02:48.425
Hey. Hi.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.361
What did you do?

02:50.395 --> 02:52.262
Excuse me?

02:52.297 --> 02:54.098
A number of my files
were raided last night.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.366
Your files?

02:55.400 --> 02:57.001
My computer files!

02:57.035 --> 02:58.302
I was hacked.

02:58.336 --> 03:00.304
They went through everything.

03:00.338 --> 03:01.906
My new device plans,
my scangen files,

03:01.940 --> 03:05.042
my personal files, everything.

03:05.076 --> 03:06.176
Why are you mad at me?

03:06.211 --> 03:08.412
Because I traced them, Eva.

03:08.446 --> 03:11.015
The attack came from Italy...

03:11.049 --> 03:12.883
From the Italian police.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.432
Hey, garbage guy!

03:28.466 --> 03:30.234
Hey!

03:30.268 --> 03:31.969
Anybody in there?

03:33.071 --> 03:34.138
Yeah.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.073
Are you the garbage guy?
You the cleaner?

03:36.107 --> 03:39.476
When the carnival's open.
Sometimes.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.245
Oh, well, that's nice,

03:41.279 --> 03:44.915
because, uh, some bad stuff
happened last night.

03:44.950 --> 03:46.217
What bad stuff?

03:46.251 --> 03:49.386
Someone knocked over
the porta-johns.

03:49.421 --> 03:50.821
All of 'em!

03:50.855 --> 03:51.989
It's a big mess.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.525
I mean, there's two types
of people in this world,

03:54.559 --> 03:55.526
right?

03:55.560 --> 03:58.929
Those that knock
the porta-johns over,

03:58.963 --> 04:01.899
and those that gotta
pick this crap up.

04:01.933 --> 04:03.367
Guess which type you are.

04:03.401 --> 04:04.602
Yeah, I'll get it,

04:04.636 --> 04:06.036
I'll get it.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.037
Are you American?

04:07.072 --> 04:08.072
What?

04:08.106 --> 04:09.373
Are you deaf?

04:09.407 --> 04:11.075
What I said was

04:11.109 --> 04:13.243
"Are you American?"

04:13.278 --> 04:15.857
You sound American to me.

04:15.977 --> 04:17.947
Yeah, I'm from all over.
I'm a mutt.

04:17.983 --> 04:20.451
Okay, mutt. All right.

04:20.485 --> 04:23.387
Start cleaning this crap up!

04:23.421 --> 04:26.957
Stinky poo-poo! Everywhere!

04:26.992 --> 04:29.526
I can smell it from here!

04:37.068 --> 04:38.602
<i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>- Who is this?</i>

04:38.637 --> 04:40.638
Who is this?

04:40.672 --> 04:42.106
Inspector Seeger.

04:42.140 --> 04:43.140
Whom am I speaking to, please?

04:43.174 --> 04:44.508
Did you say "Inspector"?

04:44.542 --> 04:46.210
Yes, sir.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.144
What do you do?

04:47.178 --> 04:48.946
What do I do?
I work for the ICC.

04:48.980 --> 04:51.148
The criminal court?

04:51.182 --> 04:53.617
And, uh, can I
look that up somewhere?

04:53.652 --> 04:54.551
<i>Excuse me?</i>

04:54.586 --> 04:55.753
Verify it.

04:55.787 --> 04:57.554
Well, you can look at
the name plate on my desk.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.123
What time?

04:59.157 --> 05:00.958
What department
do you work for?

05:00.992 --> 05:02.993
North Holland.
The Netherlands.

05:03.028 --> 05:05.095
Yeah, well, how about this,
Inspector North Holland?

05:05.130 --> 05:06.563
How about you tell me
why the hell you're calling me?

05:06.598 --> 05:08.098
Oh.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.366
Of course.

05:09.401 --> 05:10.901
Rude of me.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.371
Because I'm standing over
a dead woman in an alley

05:14.406 --> 05:18.342
and yours is the last number
she dialed on her cell phone.

05:25.363 --> 05:28.877

05:59.597 --> 06:02.532
Anne-Marie!

06:03.734 --> 06:07.337
Anne-Marie,
answer your bloody phone!

06:11.542 --> 06:12.305
McConnell.

06:12.425 --> 06:13.886
Oui, bonjour.
Vous parlez Francais?

06:14.006 --> 06:16.780
Only enough to order
over-priced wine.

06:16.814 --> 06:17.697
Excusez-moi?

06:17.817 --> 06:18.839
No Francais.

06:18.959 --> 06:22.019
Okay, I'm looking for
Detective Sergeant San?

06:22.139 --> 06:24.054
Anne-Marie? She's not here.
What do you need?

06:24.531 --> 06:26.165
<i>I have been expecting a report</i>

06:26.285 --> 06:27.827
from the arrests she made
the other night.

06:27.947 --> 06:28.863
And you're a cop?

06:28.983 --> 06:31.572
Yes, from her old unit in Lyon.

06:31.607 --> 06:33.041
Listen, we have
two men in holding

06:33.075 --> 06:34.776
we must release soon
without reports.

06:34.810 --> 06:37.412
I'm sure she'll be in any time.

06:37.446 --> 06:38.846
What's your name?

06:38.881 --> 06:39.714
<i>Tell her it's Pare...</i>

06:39.748 --> 06:41.916
Francois Pare from Lyon.

06:41.950 --> 06:43.484
She has the number.
It's her old desk.

06:43.519 --> 06:45.953
All right, mate. Cheers.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.722
See here?

06:47.756 --> 06:49.123
This is the I.P. address

06:49.158 --> 06:50.792
of the computer
that hacked mine.

06:50.826 --> 06:52.694
It's based in Rome.

06:52.728 --> 06:54.095
How close can you trace it?

06:54.129 --> 06:55.897
How close?

06:55.931 --> 06:57.932
Yeah. Can you locate
the actual computer?

06:57.966 --> 06:59.033
Why?

06:59.068 --> 07:00.068
So I know who it was

07:00.102 --> 07:02.036
before I call
and scream at someone.

07:03.906 --> 07:05.740
So you're saying you have
no idea who did this?

07:05.774 --> 07:08.943
Yeah, I'm saying
that I have no idea.

07:08.977 --> 07:10.011
Because remember, you said

07:10.045 --> 07:11.479
you were going to
tell them about me?

07:11.513 --> 07:13.448
I also remember
that I told you, Sebastian,

07:13.482 --> 07:15.468
that I was joking, remember?

07:15.588 --> 07:17.151
I don't know
how close I can get

07:17.186 --> 07:18.453
to the specific computer.

07:18.487 --> 07:19.320
Every time I try,

07:19.355 --> 07:21.122
I get kicked
out of their system.

07:21.156 --> 07:24.492
It's like it's just waiting
for me to retaliate.

07:24.526 --> 07:26.861
So how can that be?

07:26.895 --> 07:28.496
Somehow, they have
all of my information,

07:28.530 --> 07:30.965
and are set up specifically
to track my usage.

07:30.999 --> 07:34.002
They can shadow me almost
anywhere on the web.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.023
I'll handle it.

07:39.258 --> 07:41.257
They have
personal information, Eva.

07:43.162 --> 07:45.664
Very personal.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.633
Yeah.

07:48.668 --> 07:51.069
I got it.
I said I'll handle it.

07:54.106 --> 07:55.240
Berger.

07:55.274 --> 07:58.143
Sebastian, I need
your help with something.

08:04.350 --> 08:06.651
Good morning.

08:06.686 --> 08:09.230
Good morning. Breakfast?

08:09.350 --> 08:11.489
Just a cup of tea.

08:11.524 --> 08:12.744
Did you sleep well?

08:13.356 --> 08:14.518
I'm sorry?

08:14.638 --> 08:15.783
Did you sleep well?

08:15.903 --> 08:18.049
Yes. I slept fine.

08:18.169 --> 08:19.664
I did not.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.499
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.101
Do you know why?

08:23.135 --> 08:24.669
No.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.104
It's because
I saw Dorn yesterday.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.174
Did you?

08:29.208 --> 08:31.543
Yeah.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.510
He found Dimitrov.
He's going to Poland.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.313
Poland?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.649
Outside Warsaw.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.585
That's where he believes
he can catch him.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.053
That's great news.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.455
I know.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.590
When will he be going?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.259
Today.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.561
Good.

08:53.299 --> 08:57.168
This is almost over, Rebecca.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.638
It's almost over.

09:02.408 --> 09:05.076
Yes...

09:09.482 --> 09:12.317
Wow, that sounds hot.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.719
Everything sounds hot to you.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.221
I don't mean like that.

09:16.255 --> 09:17.575
I mean, it sounds like
you're pissed off.

09:17.695 --> 09:18.490
Well, I am pissed off

09:18.524 --> 09:20.157
because nobody at my old office

09:20.277 --> 09:21.459
ever answers the phone.

09:21.493 --> 09:22.794
What is it

09:22.828 --> 09:24.496
with everyone and
their old offices today?

09:24.530 --> 09:25.930
What do you mean?

09:25.965 --> 09:29.274
One of Anne-Marie's mates
from Lyon called earlier

09:29.394 --> 09:31.569
about some arrest report
she never did.

09:32.445 --> 09:34.345
That doesn't sound
like Anne-Marie.

09:34.465 --> 09:35.006
I know.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.644
Have you talked to her at all?

09:36.764 --> 09:38.084
She wasn't here yesterday,

09:38.119 --> 09:39.319
and I haven't seen her today.

09:39.353 --> 09:41.335
No. Maybe Hickman knows
where she is.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.417
They spend a lot
of time together.

09:43.537 --> 09:44.840
Where is he?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.036
Sebastian went
to meet him somewhere,

09:47.156 --> 09:48.295
with the scangen.

09:48.329 --> 09:49.296
A crime scene?

09:49.330 --> 09:50.564
I guess so.

09:50.598 --> 09:52.596
How come no one ever
tells me anything?

09:52.716 --> 09:53.851
All I know for sure

09:53.885 --> 09:57.187
is that there's a dead woman.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.990
And if it's who I think it is,

10:00.025 --> 10:01.659
it's not going to be
from natural causes.

10:01.693 --> 10:04.695
Who do you think it is?

10:04.729 --> 10:06.196
Someone I know...

10:06.231 --> 10:09.199
intimately.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.801
Oh, sorry.

10:10.835 --> 10:12.236
But how do you...

10:12.270 --> 10:14.071
Whether it is her, or it isn't,

10:14.105 --> 10:15.672
I asked you to come here

10:15.707 --> 10:17.808
because I want to help these
folks have every advantage

10:17.842 --> 10:19.410
in figuring out who did this.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.444
Sure.

10:20.478 --> 10:22.379
I can't imagine
the North Holland P.D.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.848
Has a whole heck of
a lot of resources.

10:24.883 --> 10:26.016
Do you have any idea

10:26.051 --> 10:27.217
who might have
wanted to hurt her?

10:27.252 --> 10:29.753
Not yet.

10:31.373 --> 10:32.573
You've got everything you need?

10:32.607 --> 10:33.841
Yeah.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.910
Are you sure you want to come
back with me to Amsterdam?

10:35.944 --> 10:37.211
I'm sure.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.713
I'm bored of waiting around
here for you to come home.

10:39.748 --> 10:41.949
Let's go, then.

10:54.629 --> 10:55.830
Are you Hickman?

10:56.424 --> 10:57.657
Inspector Seeger?

10:57.777 --> 11:00.101
Arabela, please.

11:00.852 --> 11:01.698
Arabela,

11:01.818 --> 11:03.571
this is Sebastian Berger.

11:03.605 --> 11:04.972
Nice to meet you.

11:05.006 --> 11:06.841
I work with Sebastian
at the ICC.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.876
Sebastian brought along

11:08.910 --> 11:10.745
some very special
investigative equipment.

11:10.779 --> 11:12.113
It might be helpful.

11:12.147 --> 11:13.438
Helpful?

11:13.558 --> 11:15.336
Evidence identification
and collection.

11:15.456 --> 11:16.650
We don't need any help.

11:16.685 --> 11:18.386
Well, you never know, right?

11:18.420 --> 11:19.120
Wrong.

11:19.154 --> 11:20.654
This way, please.

11:37.039 --> 11:38.639
Do you know this woman?

11:42.477 --> 11:43.778
Oh, my God.

11:45.580 --> 11:49.450
She's not...

11:49.484 --> 11:50.618
It's not who I thought
it was going to be.

11:50.652 --> 11:52.486
But you do know her?

11:52.521 --> 11:54.560
She's pretty disfigured,
but yeah.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.856
Yes or no?

11:55.891 --> 11:59.427
Yes. Her name is Anika.

11:59.461 --> 12:02.196
She's a bank manager
in Amsterdam.

12:04.093 --> 12:05.200
<i>Do you recognize her?</i>

12:05.320 --> 12:07.071
 I doubt her mother <i>
</i> would recognize her.<i></i>

12:07.521 --> 12:08.953
I hope she doesn't have to.

12:09.073 --> 12:10.873
It's the bank manager.

12:10.908 --> 12:12.041
From the robbery.

12:12.076 --> 12:13.676
The one that outed you
as a cop?

12:13.711 --> 12:15.144
- Yeah.
- Really?

12:15.179 --> 12:17.680
I would have never...
are you sure?

12:17.715 --> 12:18.815
Yeah, it's her.

12:18.849 --> 12:20.583
It's Anika.

12:20.617 --> 12:21.718
Why would she call you?

12:22.300 --> 12:25.054
That's the same thing
I was going to ask.

12:25.089 --> 12:26.522
A 10-second call

12:26.557 --> 12:30.660
was the last thing on her cell.

12:30.694 --> 12:32.729
A 10-second call to you.

12:34.865 --> 12:35.865
Give us a minute.

12:39.837 --> 12:42.171
I'm sorry, was that a question?

12:42.206 --> 12:43.573
Is it true?

12:43.607 --> 12:44.774
You already know it is.

12:44.808 --> 12:46.909
If you're going to try
to catch someone in a lie,

12:46.944 --> 12:48.745
ask the question
before you give them the answer.

12:48.779 --> 12:50.113
Okay...

12:50.147 --> 12:51.714
What did she want?

12:51.749 --> 12:54.517
10 seconds
doesn't mean we talked,

12:54.551 --> 12:55.852
only that she dialed my phone.

12:55.886 --> 12:57.487
You're saying
the call didn't connect?

12:57.521 --> 13:00.023
I'm saying you have
no evidence that it did.

13:00.057 --> 13:02.792
"This is Hickman.
I'll call you back."

13:02.826 --> 13:04.193
Come again?

13:04.228 --> 13:06.462
Your no-frills
outgoing message

13:06.497 --> 13:08.064
takes less than two seconds.

13:08.098 --> 13:10.800
That leaves
an eight-second window.

13:10.834 --> 13:13.670
A hang-up would have resulted
in a three-second call.

13:13.704 --> 13:15.438
That's not evidence.

13:15.472 --> 13:17.473
True.

13:17.508 --> 13:19.976
But her cellular provider
already verified

13:20.010 --> 13:20.843
the call went through.

13:20.878 --> 13:22.612
There you go.

13:22.646 --> 13:23.446
I had a feeling you had more.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.981
A connection was made.

13:25.015 --> 13:26.783
It's still not proof
that we talked.

13:26.817 --> 13:27.817
Are you saying you didn't?

13:27.851 --> 13:28.818
That's private.

13:28.852 --> 13:30.653
I'm sorry?

13:30.688 --> 13:32.221
What we talked about

13:32.256 --> 13:34.490
has to do with
an ongoing investigation.

13:34.525 --> 13:35.692
Into what?

13:35.726 --> 13:37.460
Sorry.

13:37.494 --> 13:38.728
That's unfortunate.

13:38.762 --> 13:40.196
No, what's unfortunate is

13:40.230 --> 13:42.165
that you think I had something
to do with this murder.

13:42.199 --> 13:44.067
I don't believe
I ever said that.

13:44.101 --> 13:46.636
You know what,
I just got tired of your game.

13:48.444 --> 13:51.207
I'm not finished.

13:51.241 --> 13:52.809
I only came here

13:52.843 --> 13:56.746
because I thought your victim
was someone that I'm close to.

13:56.780 --> 13:58.614
That does not describe
me and Anika.

13:58.649 --> 13:59.682
I have nothing else for you.

13:59.717 --> 14:01.818
How long has the other woman
been missing?

14:01.852 --> 14:03.519
I didn't say she was missing.

14:03.554 --> 14:07.757
No, but I told you I was
standing over a dead woman.

14:07.791 --> 14:10.793
If you thought it was
the person you're close to,

14:10.828 --> 14:12.528
she must be missing.

14:12.563 --> 14:14.931
Two missing women,
with you in common.

14:14.965 --> 14:16.632
That's unfortunate.

14:16.667 --> 14:20.536
If you're going to arrest me,
then why don't you do that?

14:20.571 --> 14:22.839
Otherwise, I'm going to back
my office at The Hague.

14:22.873 --> 14:23.706
Okay.

14:23.741 --> 14:25.208
Okay?

14:25.242 --> 14:26.442
Carl Hickman,

14:26.477 --> 14:29.476
you're under arrest for
the murder of Anika Hauten.

14:39.890 --> 14:40.857
Yes?

14:40.891 --> 14:42.125
Louis?

14:42.159 --> 14:43.159
<i>It's done.</i>

14:43.193 --> 14:44.961
They will think
you are going to Poland.

14:44.995 --> 14:47.630
I'm on my way
to the airport now.

14:47.664 --> 14:48.765
<i>We're on the train.</i>

14:48.799 --> 14:51.167
We're going
to Amsterdam together.

14:51.201 --> 14:52.268
For now.

14:52.302 --> 14:53.870
I'm sorry?

14:53.904 --> 14:55.838
Good luck, Dorn,

14:55.873 --> 14:58.141
and thank you for
taking this for us...

14:58.175 --> 14:59.142
For Etienne.

14:59.176 --> 15:02.145
Don't thank me
until I've succeeded.

15:02.179 --> 15:04.080
I have faith.

15:04.114 --> 15:06.082
Let's hope it's not misplaced.

15:06.116 --> 15:07.216
<i>It's not.</i>

15:07.251 --> 15:09.319
I will tell her.

15:09.353 --> 15:10.286
Call me when you can.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.021
I'll call you when I get back.

15:15.192 --> 15:16.759
He sends you love.

15:16.794 --> 15:18.161
Will he be all right?

15:18.195 --> 15:20.563
What do you
want me to tell you,

15:20.597 --> 15:21.864
the truth?

15:21.899 --> 15:23.733
Yes.

15:23.767 --> 15:25.268
You want the truth,

15:25.302 --> 15:27.804
but you lied to him
this morning.

15:27.838 --> 15:29.872
I lied?

15:29.907 --> 15:31.240
Yeah.

15:31.275 --> 15:32.275
You told him

15:32.309 --> 15:33.976
that we know how to
talk to each other.

15:34.011 --> 15:35.311
But we don't.

15:36.747 --> 15:39.982
Not anymore.

15:41.785 --> 15:44.253
You're not
going to believe this.

15:44.288 --> 15:45.622
What's up?

15:45.656 --> 15:47.857
Hickman asked me to go
to a crime scene with him,

15:47.891 --> 15:49.225
to gather some evidence.

15:49.259 --> 15:50.226
Is that a case for us?

15:50.260 --> 15:52.362
No. It's a single murder.

15:52.396 --> 15:54.330
How is Hickman involved?

15:54.365 --> 15:56.265
They arrested him for it.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.266
You're kidding.

15:57.301 --> 15:58.968
They arrested
Hickman for murder?

15:59.002 --> 16:00.637
The victim
is that bank manager,

16:00.671 --> 16:02.939
the one that outed him as a cop
during the robbery.

16:02.973 --> 16:04.173
Is that why
they think he did it?

16:04.208 --> 16:06.809
I'm not sure
the detective even knew that.

16:06.844 --> 16:07.944
All she said was

16:07.978 --> 16:09.045
that the bank manager

16:09.079 --> 16:10.713
made a phone call to Hickman
before she died.

16:10.748 --> 16:12.215
That doesn't seem like
a whole lot of evidence.

16:12.249 --> 16:15.284
No.

16:15.319 --> 16:16.619
Wasn't the woman
at the bank blonde?

16:16.653 --> 16:17.820
- Yeah.
- Very blonde.

16:17.855 --> 16:19.155
Well, this woman had dark hair.

16:19.189 --> 16:20.189
She dyed it?

16:20.224 --> 16:21.257
Apparently, but...

16:21.291 --> 16:22.992
how would Hickman know that?

16:23.026 --> 16:25.061
He recognized
the body straight away.

16:25.095 --> 16:27.930
The hair colour didn't even
seem to surprise him.

16:27.965 --> 16:29.032
And why would she call him?

16:31.435 --> 16:34.237
Major Daniel.

16:34.271 --> 16:36.205
<i>It's Eva.</i>
<i>When does your train arrive?</i>

16:36.240 --> 16:37.674
About an hour.

16:37.708 --> 16:39.175
Why?

16:39.209 --> 16:41.110
<i>Hickman has been arrested.</i>

16:41.145 --> 16:42.011
What?

16:42.046 --> 16:44.047
<i>Yeah. Arrested.</i>

16:44.081 --> 16:46.015
- When?
<i>- Just now.</i>

16:46.050 --> 16:50.086
I'll be there as soon as I can.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.822
What is it?

16:53.698 --> 16:56.159
I won't be able to go

16:56.193 --> 16:58.530
to the Amsterdam apartment
with you.

17:02.933 --> 17:04.133
Is that supposed to be
a surprise?

17:04.167 --> 17:05.768
Oh, please.

17:05.803 --> 17:10.039
Could you just, once,
be understanding?

17:10.074 --> 17:11.174
For once?

17:11.208 --> 17:14.109
Yeah.

17:14.144 --> 17:16.145
Hickman has been arrested...

17:16.180 --> 17:17.747
I don't...
I don't care.

17:18.252 --> 17:20.349
Well, I do.
I have to.

17:20.384 --> 17:22.285
Fine.

17:22.319 --> 17:23.319
I'm going back to Paris.

17:23.354 --> 17:24.242
Excuse me?

17:24.363 --> 17:25.662
On the next train back.

17:25.781 --> 17:27.752
Our flat is still bugged.

17:27.873 --> 17:29.225
Well, if they want to
listen to me pack,

17:29.259 --> 17:30.326
they can listen.

17:30.361 --> 17:33.896
We said we are going
to Amsterdam together.

17:33.931 --> 17:36.733
We've said many things
many times, Louis.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.968
The plans always change,

17:39.003 --> 17:40.003
and always end

17:40.037 --> 17:43.136
with me in that apartment,
alone.

17:43.607 --> 17:45.942
If they've been listening,
they know that, too.

17:45.976 --> 17:47.677
This will not
seem odd to them in the least.

17:47.712 --> 17:50.413
This is my job, all right?
My job!

17:51.182 --> 17:53.650
What? What!

17:55.453 --> 18:01.603
What do you want me to do,

17:57.283 --> 17:59.055
just ignore it?

17:59.090 --> 18:01.483
All I ever asked
was for a little balance.

18:01.603 --> 18:02.659
Balance.

18:02.693 --> 18:04.828
Yes.

18:04.862 --> 18:06.663
That's not the reason
why you hate me.

18:06.697 --> 18:07.831
I don't hate you.

18:07.865 --> 18:09.199
Yes, you do.

18:09.233 --> 18:12.135
You blame me for Etienne.

18:12.169 --> 18:13.670
Oh, please.

18:13.704 --> 18:16.206
You think I don't see it
in your eyes

18:16.240 --> 18:17.707
every time you look at me?

18:17.742 --> 18:18.575
I've never blamed you.

18:20.611 --> 18:22.045
Do you remember

18:22.079 --> 18:26.449
this morning I told you
I didn't sleep well?

18:26.484 --> 18:28.368
The truth is

18:28.488 --> 18:33.089
I haven't slept well once
since that night.

18:33.124 --> 18:35.458
I have the same dream.

18:35.493 --> 18:36.860
I come home,

18:36.894 --> 18:40.864
our house is burning,

18:40.898 --> 18:43.566
and you are on the ground,

18:43.601 --> 18:47.537
with Etienne in your arms.

18:47.571 --> 18:50.507
And you keep saying
something to me,

18:50.541 --> 18:53.643
over and over.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.882
Do you remember...

18:58.916 --> 19:01.718
what you said to me that night?

19:09.527 --> 19:10.894
"What did you do?"

19:10.928 --> 19:13.763
What did I do?

19:13.798 --> 19:16.499
What did I do?

19:16.534 --> 19:18.968
So, you can leave me
in this hell,

19:19.003 --> 19:21.938
you can divorce me if you want.

19:21.973 --> 19:24.207
You can get on with your life

19:24.241 --> 19:27.210
if you want.

19:27.244 --> 19:31.114
Just don't tell me
it's because of my team,

19:31.148 --> 19:33.616
or my job.

19:48.799 --> 19:51.234
Not only do I work for the ICC,

19:51.268 --> 19:54.537
I'm a former NYPD detective.

19:54.572 --> 19:55.538
Do you really believe

19:55.573 --> 19:57.807
that I murdered this woman?

19:59.744 --> 20:02.045
I want to show you some things,

20:02.079 --> 20:03.680
and when I'm finished,

20:03.714 --> 20:05.648
I'm going to ask you
one question.

20:05.683 --> 20:07.150
One?

20:07.184 --> 20:09.586
One.

20:09.620 --> 20:11.621
A few weeks ago,

20:11.656 --> 20:14.090
you were a hostage
in a bank robbery,

20:14.125 --> 20:15.191
during which

20:15.226 --> 20:16.760
my homicide victim...

20:16.794 --> 20:17.894
a fellow hostage...

20:17.928 --> 20:20.730
informed the robbers
that you are an officer

20:20.765 --> 20:22.232
and put you in grave danger.

20:22.266 --> 20:25.068
The robbers then found
a hypodermic kit on you,

20:25.102 --> 20:28.571
exposing you as a drug abuser.

20:29.740 --> 20:32.575
My victim then filed
an official statement

20:32.610 --> 20:34.978
with Amsterdam Chief Helstrom

20:35.012 --> 20:38.081
and, apparently, also
with your boss at The Hague,

20:38.115 --> 20:40.583
Major Daniel,

20:40.618 --> 20:42.585
attesting to your drug use.

20:42.620 --> 20:45.180
I can't imagine
this went well for you.

20:47.024 --> 20:48.992
A week later,

20:49.026 --> 20:50.500
after the robbery,

20:50.620 --> 20:53.863
my victim reported 100,000 Euro

20:53.898 --> 20:55.365
missing from the vault,

20:55.399 --> 20:57.867
despite the fact
that every other witness

20:57.902 --> 21:00.770
reported the perpetrators
never took any money

21:00.805 --> 21:02.639
and none was found on them

21:02.673 --> 21:05.275
during their arrest.

21:05.309 --> 21:06.376
After that,

21:06.410 --> 21:10.880
you went to my victim's flat
for six minutes.

21:10.915 --> 21:13.116
Then you left.

21:13.150 --> 21:14.718
She exited

21:14.752 --> 21:17.187
a few minutes later
in a great hurry

21:17.221 --> 21:18.788
with two bags,

21:18.823 --> 21:21.992
one of which was found
at the murder scene.

21:22.026 --> 21:24.227
She went to the bank,

21:24.261 --> 21:25.395
where she was
no longer employed,

21:25.429 --> 21:28.298
illegally accessed
their computer systems

21:28.332 --> 21:30.867
and closed an account,

21:30.901 --> 21:34.037
an account held by
a traveling carnival,

21:34.071 --> 21:35.638
which winters
outside of Amsterdam,

21:35.673 --> 21:38.108
where you work and live.

21:38.142 --> 21:41.044
The 10-second phone call
she made to you

21:41.078 --> 21:45.181
was 15 minutes
after closing this account.

21:46.450 --> 21:48.385
She was then found
beaten to death

21:48.419 --> 21:53.356
with what my examiner is calling
tremendous rage

21:53.391 --> 21:56.226
by a person who knew her,

21:56.260 --> 21:58.695
and you refuse to tell me

21:58.729 --> 22:01.264
what the phone call
she made to you was about.

22:01.298 --> 22:06.269
Finally, while you were with me
at the homicide scene,

22:06.303 --> 22:07.671
my colleagues found,

22:07.705 --> 22:10.774
behind the trailer
you reside in,

22:10.808 --> 22:13.743
the other piece of luggage
she left with.

22:13.778 --> 22:15.412
It had a compartment
ripped out of it

22:15.446 --> 22:17.147
at some point.

22:17.181 --> 22:18.181
I don't know what was in it,

22:18.215 --> 22:22.452
but 100,000 Euro
is a pretty good guess.

22:22.486 --> 22:24.387
Are you finished?

22:24.422 --> 22:26.690
Yes.

22:26.724 --> 22:28.992
What's your question?

22:30.795 --> 22:32.295
What would you do
if you were me?

22:36.467 --> 22:38.935
I'd lock me up.

22:42.546 --> 22:44.321
Do we know anything new.

22:44.338 --> 22:45.805
We waited for you.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.328
Where is Anne-Marie?

22:47.448 --> 22:48.508
We don't know.

22:48.542 --> 22:49.576
She never came in.

22:49.610 --> 22:50.577
One of her old colleagues says

22:50.611 --> 22:51.644
they're waiting for
a report from her

22:51.679 --> 22:53.413
on some prisoners.

22:55.609 --> 22:56.403
Major Daniel?

22:56.523 --> 22:57.217
Yeah.

22:57.251 --> 22:58.418
I'm Commander Bergen.

22:58.452 --> 22:59.686
They told me you were coming.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.387
Hi.

23:01.422 --> 23:02.388
Where is Hickman?

23:02.423 --> 23:03.490
He's fine.

23:03.524 --> 23:05.325
Why don't we talk in my office?

23:05.359 --> 23:07.560
Come on.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.229
All right.

23:10.264 --> 23:14.501
A 20-year homicide detective
murders an acquaintance,

23:14.535 --> 23:18.571
leaving behind a Mountain
of circumstantial evidence,

23:18.606 --> 23:20.573
and then props the perfect piece
of physical evidence

23:20.608 --> 23:21.975
against the back wall
of his home.

23:22.009 --> 23:24.511
So, you don't think I did it?

23:24.545 --> 23:25.578
Not anymore.

23:25.613 --> 23:26.846
Well then, what the hell
am I doing here?

23:26.881 --> 23:30.750
My boss doesn't quite
understand the concept.

23:30.785 --> 23:35.221
I need something to change
my commander's mind.

23:35.341 --> 23:36.222
What can I do?

23:36.257 --> 23:37.657
Tell me about the phone call,

23:37.691 --> 23:40.727
or the investigation
it was about.

23:40.761 --> 23:44.631
Give me a logical explanation
for any of this.

23:48.936 --> 23:49.969
I'm sorry.

23:50.004 --> 23:51.971
You'd rather go to jail

23:52.006 --> 23:53.440
than tell me
about your investigation?

23:53.474 --> 23:55.742
If those are my only choices.

23:55.776 --> 23:58.378
I need to get out
of here, inspector.

23:58.412 --> 24:00.980
I told you, there's a woman.

24:01.015 --> 24:02.382
The missing woman?

24:02.416 --> 24:03.450
Apparently so.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.385
Inspector?

24:05.419 --> 24:06.719
Can you bring your files?

24:06.754 --> 24:07.720
Now?

24:07.755 --> 24:09.055
Yes, sir.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.028
I'll be back.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.329
I'll be waiting.

24:51.565 --> 24:53.333
It's almost all circumstantial.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.468
Yeah, but that's a lot
of bloody circumstance.

24:55.503 --> 24:56.703
Did Hickman know

24:56.737 --> 24:58.304
that the bank manager
made an official statement

24:58.339 --> 24:59.072
about his drug use?

24:59.106 --> 25:00.140
Yes.

25:00.174 --> 25:01.608
How did he find out
about the statement?

25:01.642 --> 25:03.042
I told him.

25:03.077 --> 25:04.377
He asked me.
I told him.

25:04.412 --> 25:05.345
You told him?

25:05.379 --> 25:07.347
Yes.

25:07.381 --> 25:08.348
You didn't think

25:08.382 --> 25:09.716
it could possibly
make him angry with her?

25:09.750 --> 25:11.299
No. I don't lie.

25:11.419 --> 25:13.970
Not to my team,
not to Detective Hickman.

25:14.090 --> 25:16.289
Sorry, this is all too perfect.

25:16.409 --> 25:17.724
I don't disagree.

25:17.758 --> 25:18.992
Eva and Sebastian,

25:19.026 --> 25:21.094
go back to the scene,
take your scangen,

25:21.128 --> 25:22.929
see what you find.

25:22.963 --> 25:24.364
Okay.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.899
Tommy,

25:25.933 --> 25:27.367
go to the morgue,

25:27.401 --> 25:28.968
take a look at the body.

25:29.003 --> 25:30.537
I love a good autopsy
in the morning.

25:30.571 --> 25:31.905
I'll take you.

25:31.939 --> 25:34.504
I'm going there anyway to check
with the medical examiner.

25:53.694 --> 25:56.029
When was the last time
you saw her?

25:56.063 --> 25:57.464
Leaving the scene

25:57.498 --> 25:58.998
to take the rescued women
to a shelter in calais.

25:59.033 --> 26:00.900
And then?

26:00.935 --> 26:03.636
<i>Then I assumed she would</i>
<i>go back home to Amsterdam.</i>

26:03.671 --> 26:05.071
My investigator says

26:05.106 --> 26:07.507
she was supposed to
send you reports?

26:07.541 --> 26:08.775
And if we don't get them soon,

26:08.809 --> 26:10.443
we'll have to
let the prisoners go.

26:10.478 --> 26:12.512
Okay, listen to me,

26:12.546 --> 26:13.847
if you hear anything
from Anne-Marie,

26:13.881 --> 26:16.049
please let me know immediately.

26:16.083 --> 26:17.450
Yes, of course.

26:17.485 --> 26:20.086
Thank you.

26:25.426 --> 26:26.826
Okay, here we go.

26:31.699 --> 26:33.199
What?

26:35.069 --> 26:37.103
It's not working properly.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.505
What does that mean?

26:38.539 --> 26:39.806
No...

26:40.941 --> 26:43.176
No, no, no, no...

26:43.210 --> 26:44.410
What is it?

26:44.445 --> 26:45.912
It's infected.

26:45.946 --> 26:47.847
The code seems to be
eating itself!

26:47.882 --> 26:50.517
- What?
- Damn it!

26:50.551 --> 26:52.919
The whole scangen program
seems to be affected.

26:54.722 --> 26:55.889
I need to get
back to the office

26:55.923 --> 26:56.856
to access my back-ups!

26:56.891 --> 26:57.891
How could that happen?

26:57.925 --> 27:00.093
I told you, I was hacked...

27:00.127 --> 27:01.694
From Rome.

27:04.762 --> 27:05.836
As you can see,

27:05.956 --> 27:07.259
there is a tremendous amount

27:07.379 --> 27:09.102
of blunt-force trauma
about the face.

27:09.136 --> 27:10.770
Any idea of the weapon used?

27:10.805 --> 27:13.173
We haven't been able
to locate any residue

27:13.207 --> 27:14.607
to get a material sample.

27:14.642 --> 27:16.042
You won't find
any weapon residue.

27:16.077 --> 27:16.976
Why not?

27:17.011 --> 27:18.578
Because that was done
with fists.

27:18.612 --> 27:20.847
Are you sure?

27:20.881 --> 27:22.148
I was a bare knuckle fighter.

27:22.183 --> 27:23.750
I am very sure.

27:25.219 --> 27:26.219
Is this possible?

27:26.253 --> 27:28.655
The killer would have to
be very powerful.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.889
But it's possible?

27:29.924 --> 27:30.857
Oh, definitely.

27:30.891 --> 27:32.725
Here's what else
I'm sure about.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.194
These wounds exclude Hickman.

27:34.228 --> 27:35.795
How?

27:35.830 --> 27:37.230
Whoever did that,

27:37.264 --> 27:39.165
did it with two hands.

27:42.937 --> 27:46.039
Left and right.

27:46.073 --> 27:48.041
In case you haven't noticed,

27:48.075 --> 27:48.908
Hickman can't pick his nose

27:48.943 --> 27:50.076
with his right hand,

27:50.111 --> 27:51.678
much less punch someone
hard enough to do that.

27:51.712 --> 27:54.714
What about these gashes?

27:54.749 --> 27:56.015
If it was done with fists...

27:56.050 --> 27:58.651
A ring.

27:58.686 --> 28:00.019
A big one.

28:05.593 --> 28:06.693
A ring with an initial.

28:09.897 --> 28:13.266
Well, he'll be busy
for a bit, then.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.201
When he does get back,

28:15.236 --> 28:18.772
we've got something
very special planned for him.

28:18.806 --> 28:20.640
Yes, "we."

28:20.674 --> 28:23.510
Me and his little friend here.

28:23.544 --> 28:25.178
Mm-hmm.

28:26.180 --> 28:27.213
Aw...

28:30.824 --> 28:31.948
Yes sir,

28:32.068 --> 28:34.162
I'm very sure and the coroner
agrees with me.

28:34.034 --> 28:36.536
The blows were clearly struck
with both hands.

28:36.570 --> 28:37.537
Inspector Seeger?

28:37.571 --> 28:38.705
Yes, sir?

28:38.739 --> 28:41.436
We've located information
on the victim's family.

28:41.556 --> 28:42.075
You have?

28:42.109 --> 28:43.076
They're local,

28:43.110 --> 28:44.043
and we'll need them
to come down

28:44.078 --> 28:45.545
to make a positive
identification.

28:45.579 --> 28:46.946
Of course.

28:46.981 --> 28:48.948
Will you be making
the death notification,

28:48.983 --> 28:50.741
or would you like us
to handle it?

28:50.861 --> 28:51.985
No, I'll go.

28:52.019 --> 28:53.519
Okay.

28:56.257 --> 28:58.558
Least favourite
part of the job.

28:58.592 --> 29:00.360
I never met a cop
who didn't hate it.

29:00.394 --> 29:03.063
But, you know, as bad as it is

29:03.097 --> 29:06.966
to notify a family
someone isn't coming home,

29:07.001 --> 29:08.401
it doesn't bother me as much

29:08.436 --> 29:10.926
as the unidentified
bodies we get.

29:11.972 --> 29:13.273
This one, for example.

29:13.307 --> 29:15.141
Car accident.

29:15.176 --> 29:16.943
Body burnt up.

29:16.977 --> 29:18.011
Vehicle burnt up.

29:18.045 --> 29:20.380
No plates, no VIN?

29:20.414 --> 29:21.381
Coroner is hoping

29:21.415 --> 29:23.950
dental records
or DNA will help.

29:23.984 --> 29:27.454
Imagine waiting for
someone to come home

29:27.488 --> 29:28.321
who never does,

29:28.355 --> 29:30.223
and you'll never know why.

29:33.461 --> 29:35.195
I'll go with you if you want,

29:35.229 --> 29:36.463
to notify
the other victim's family.

29:36.497 --> 29:38.965
I'd appreciate that.

30:09.997 --> 30:12.032
They're releasing you.

30:12.066 --> 30:13.166
Why?

30:13.200 --> 30:14.367
Tommy proved

30:14.402 --> 30:16.169
that the victim was beaten
with two hands.

30:16.203 --> 30:18.505
First time
this ever helped out.

30:18.539 --> 30:20.173
The killer was wearing a ring.

30:20.207 --> 30:22.042
Monogrammed.

30:22.076 --> 30:23.176
With the letter "G."

30:23.210 --> 30:24.677
Son of a bitch.

30:24.712 --> 30:26.312
I think we need to talk.

30:26.347 --> 30:28.114
Not in this building.

31:41.322 --> 31:44.057
When?

31:44.091 --> 31:45.825
Good.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.527
Good.

31:47.561 --> 31:50.330
The police let him go.

31:50.364 --> 31:53.478
Let's go make a homecoming.

31:56.837 --> 31:57.804
Carl!

31:57.838 --> 31:58.805
I have to go, Louis.

31:58.839 --> 32:00.092
Someone I know
may be in trouble.

32:00.212 --> 32:01.146
From Phillip Genovese?

32:01.266 --> 32:03.610
At the carnival?

32:03.644 --> 32:05.378
What did you say?

32:05.413 --> 32:08.214
How do you know
the name Genovese?

32:08.249 --> 32:09.982
That's the guy
who hurt you, yes?

32:10.102 --> 32:11.037
Was it Anne-Marie?

32:11.157 --> 32:12.152
Anne-Marie?

32:12.186 --> 32:13.653
Yes, did she tell you
about him?

32:13.688 --> 32:15.355
She knows?
That's why she's gone?

32:15.389 --> 32:16.556
Oh, God, no, Louis.

32:16.590 --> 32:18.458
I asked her to run his name
months ago.

32:18.492 --> 32:21.227
Where she is today
has nothing to do with that.

32:21.262 --> 32:22.362
Well, she never betrayed you.

32:22.396 --> 32:23.663
Good, so how do you know?

32:23.698 --> 32:25.598
Louis, how do you...

32:30.171 --> 32:31.337
You knew the day
you came to the carnival.

32:31.372 --> 32:34.341
You left people behind
in New York,

32:34.375 --> 32:36.242
people who care about you.

32:36.277 --> 32:37.811
They called me
when you moved here.

32:40.448 --> 32:41.381
How long were you watching me?

32:41.415 --> 32:44.117
I just checked in
from time to time.

32:44.151 --> 32:45.151
You spied on me.

32:45.186 --> 32:45.885
As a friend.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.253
That's not good enough.

32:47.288 --> 32:48.421
You're probably right.

32:48.456 --> 32:50.590
I'm not talking about this
right now.

32:50.624 --> 32:51.591
Where are you going?

32:51.625 --> 32:53.760
I'm going to a carnival,

32:53.794 --> 32:57.263
because Genovese
is my mess to clean up!

32:57.298 --> 32:58.798
I can't let you do that, Carl.

32:58.833 --> 32:59.733
Excuse me?

32:59.767 --> 33:01.601
You are a member of my team.

33:01.635 --> 33:03.570
I can't let you become
a vigilante.

33:03.604 --> 33:05.338
You know what, you're right.

33:05.373 --> 33:06.606
Yes, I am.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.475
I quit.

33:14.901 --> 33:16.793
- No...
- Sebastian?

33:16.828 --> 33:18.328
It's all gone.

33:18.363 --> 33:19.468
What is gone?

33:19.588 --> 33:20.206
All of my work.

33:20.326 --> 33:21.946
My back-up files,
it's all gone.

33:22.066 --> 33:23.367
How?

33:25.604 --> 33:26.771
What am I going to do now?

33:26.805 --> 33:30.208
Sebastian, I need you
to pull yourself together.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.075
Can you do that?

33:45.123 --> 33:47.458
Major said
to get back here fast.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.493
Yeah, well, he's in
with Sebastian now.

33:49.528 --> 33:50.528
Where's Hickman?

33:50.562 --> 33:52.063
Major says he quit.

33:52.097 --> 33:53.531
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

33:53.565 --> 33:54.532
I hope that isn't my fault.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.000
It's not.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.699
But I need your help.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.744
Zatrzymaj!

34:09.781 --> 34:11.482
Prosze zatrzymaj!

34:13.252 --> 34:16.020
If you don't want
to be involved, I understand.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.188
Are you kidding?

34:18.223 --> 34:21.559
I don't get to do something
like this too often.

34:22.694 --> 34:24.161
Good. Let's get ready.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.280
Major Daniel.

34:42.313 --> 34:43.414
Louis, thank God.

34:43.447 --> 34:44.549
Dorn?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.050
<i>It was a set-up, Louis!</i>

34:46.083 --> 34:47.652
The whole thing.
They knew I was coming.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.054
<i>They must have known</i>
<i>that we discovered their bugs.</i>

34:50.088 --> 34:52.056
You and Rebecca
have to go underground.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.625
<i>Get out of</i>
<i>your Amsterdam apartment</i>

34:54.659 --> 34:55.592
and find somewhere else
to stay.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.196
But Dorn,
she went back to Paris!

35:00.199 --> 35:01.632
Shari?

35:05.304 --> 35:08.439
Oh, my God.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.921
Genovese!

35:59.258 --> 36:01.893
I'm here!

36:03.795 --> 36:06.531
I got a pathetic story for you.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.272
<i>You know our Dutch bank broad?</i>

36:09.392 --> 36:10.657
<i>Anika?</i>

36:12.638 --> 36:14.806
<i>She wouldn't cop to</i>

36:14.840 --> 36:16.641
<i>who had her close down</i>
<i>my bank account,</i>

36:16.675 --> 36:20.611
<i>but I knew that she didn't</i>
<i>do that on her own.</i>

36:20.646 --> 36:23.614
You didn't have to kill her!

36:23.649 --> 36:25.149
<i>That's beside the point.</i>

36:25.184 --> 36:30.488
<i>She's not the first chippy</i>
<i>that needed a broken nose</i>

36:30.522 --> 36:32.623
<i>before they start talking.</i>

36:32.658 --> 36:35.593
<i>I punched her once...</i>

36:35.627 --> 36:38.229
<i>And she told me everything.</i>

36:38.263 --> 36:39.530
<i>Everything.</i>

36:39.565 --> 36:41.732
<i>She robbed the bank,</i>

36:41.767 --> 36:42.934
<i>she said</i>
<i>I could have the money.</i>

36:42.968 --> 36:45.169
<i>And then you know what?</i>
<i>You know what she did?</i>

36:45.204 --> 36:47.171
<i>She sold you out.</i>

36:47.206 --> 36:49.640
<i>She said, "It's Hickman.</i>

36:49.675 --> 36:52.310
<i>His name is Carl Hickman!"</i>

36:52.344 --> 36:53.911
I couldn't wait
for you to find out!

36:53.946 --> 36:55.480
I wanted you to know.

36:56.849 --> 36:58.049
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

36:58.083 --> 37:00.351
<i>I didn't have a clue</i>
<i>who Carl Hickman was, man.</i>

37:00.385 --> 37:01.519
<i>I mean, I know now.</i>

37:01.553 --> 37:03.435
<i>You traveled halfway</i>
<i>around the world,</i>

37:03.555 --> 37:04.222
<i>to come and get me</i>

37:04.256 --> 37:07.191
<i>in that crappy, dump trailer,</i>

37:07.226 --> 37:09.327
<i>but I swear to God,</i>
<i>I had to search you, man.</i>

37:09.361 --> 37:11.179
<i>I didn't have a clue.</i>

37:11.794 --> 37:13.554
<i>And you know what?</i>

37:13.674 --> 37:16.207
<i>Given our "history" together,</i>
<i>Carl,</i>

37:16.327 --> 37:17.702
<i>that is pathetic.</i>

37:18.737 --> 37:22.406
Did you actually
come by yourself?

37:22.441 --> 37:23.341
Where's Shari?

37:23.375 --> 37:26.210
That's pretty ballsy

37:26.245 --> 37:28.479
for a one-armed carnie
crap scooper.

37:28.514 --> 37:30.915
This is between me and you!

37:30.949 --> 37:31.949
No, that changed

37:31.984 --> 37:33.718
when you sacrificed
little Anika.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.287
Leave Shari out of it.

37:36.321 --> 37:38.389
She's not a part of it!

37:40.592 --> 37:41.959
She is now, Sport.

37:41.994 --> 37:43.561
Come on!

37:43.595 --> 37:45.363
And face me,

37:45.397 --> 37:47.865
you son of a bitch!

37:56.809 --> 37:58.276
It's more like
a son of a whore,

37:58.310 --> 37:59.710
but that was an honest mistake.

37:59.745 --> 38:02.480
Did you bring
any kids with you?

38:02.514 --> 38:04.682
Ah, you got me with that one.

38:11.490 --> 38:15.293
A revolver, really?

38:15.327 --> 38:16.494
Carl?

38:16.528 --> 38:19.797
You really think six bullets
is enough to come at me?

38:19.832 --> 38:22.767
It only takes one.

38:22.801 --> 38:23.734
Shut up.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.806
Stop talking.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.377
I know you probably
can't see this right now

38:33.412 --> 38:34.946
'cause you're also blurry-eyed,

38:34.980 --> 38:36.247
but this gun here,

38:36.281 --> 38:39.016
this is the one that I used
to kill the fortune teller.

38:39.051 --> 38:40.952
There's one shot left
in the chamber.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.020
Oh. Oh, and before I forget.

38:43.055 --> 38:46.858
She'd left a message
for the police,

38:46.892 --> 38:49.694
telling them that
when you got back from jail,

38:49.728 --> 38:51.462
you were all crazy.

38:51.496 --> 38:54.832
You were all, like,
wild-eyed and crazy.

38:54.867 --> 38:56.667
It was just crazy!

39:03.876 --> 39:06.711
Know how I got her to do that?

39:06.745 --> 39:10.047
She was a lot stronger
than that little Dutch girl,

39:10.082 --> 39:11.015
I'll tell you that,

39:11.049 --> 39:13.684
but in this case...

39:13.719 --> 39:14.986
Not such a good idea for her.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.571
So...

39:33.605 --> 39:36.107
You are going to get discovered
sooner or later,

39:36.141 --> 39:38.109
and you got a lot of
explaining to do, right?

39:38.143 --> 39:40.912
Um...

39:40.946 --> 39:42.880
This right here...

39:44.683 --> 39:45.716
Just...

39:45.751 --> 39:50.521
Smells of sort of
murder-suicide, doesn't it?

39:50.556 --> 39:53.524
It does.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.760
But you're gonna have to drag
little miss fortune teller

39:55.794 --> 39:57.462
over there to the gun,

39:57.496 --> 39:59.897
you have shown a lot of
determination in the past.

39:59.932 --> 40:02.133
In fact...

40:03.735 --> 40:05.837
Let me help you.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.371
Little Anika,

40:07.406 --> 40:11.742
she told me about
another one of your issues.

40:11.777 --> 40:15.780
Now, this could be stronger
than you're used to,

40:15.814 --> 40:17.381
but maybe not.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.382
Either way,

40:18.417 --> 40:19.784
it's going to help
take the edge off

40:19.818 --> 40:20.952
what you gotta do.

40:28.193 --> 40:29.160
You know,

40:29.194 --> 40:31.696
I thought about
just killing you,

40:31.730 --> 40:33.998
but I kind of did that already,

40:34.032 --> 40:34.932
in New York,

40:34.967 --> 40:36.868
didn't I?

40:36.902 --> 40:38.936
I mean, what could be worse

40:38.971 --> 40:41.038
than leaving you
to live your life

40:41.073 --> 40:42.140
the way you're living it now?

40:42.174 --> 40:45.076
Twice.
