<i>Amy: Previously on "Heartland:"</i>

00:04.462 --> 00:06.339
- I've got a horse I want
you to look at.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.466
(Loud whinny)
- Whoa!

00:08.508 --> 00:10.301
Val: His name's Flame.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.594
(Flame snorts)

00:11.636 --> 00:13.513
- I'm impressed.
- Thanks.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.639
- I'd like you to keep
training with him,

00:14.681 --> 00:16.683
and who knows?

00:16.725 --> 00:19.310
Maybe you'll be the one to ride
him in the Okotoks show.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.146
Mitch: Nice seein' ya,
I'll see you around.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.731
Ty: Okay, all right, see 'ya.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.566
- Could you believe that?!

00:24.607 --> 00:27.318
Acting like that, after what
he put Lou through.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.778
- (Val chuckles)

00:28.820 --> 00:30.697
What do you say, are you in?

00:30.739 --> 00:32.406
- I'm in. (Sighs)

00:35.326 --> 00:36.578
(Ducks quack)

00:40.290 --> 00:41.750
(Spartan nickers)

00:45.587 --> 00:48.298
(Remi barks)

00:48.340 --> 00:50.508
(Hooves thud, horses whinny)

00:51.384 --> 00:53.678
Amy: Hup! Hup!

00:53.720 --> 00:55.597
Chh! Chh! Chh! Chh! Chh!

00:58.683 --> 01:01.353
(Whistles) Come on, come on!

01:01.394 --> 01:02.437
(Whistles)

01:06.232 --> 01:07.525
(Hooves thud)

01:08.902 --> 01:11.613
(Horse whinnies, Amy whistles)

01:11.654 --> 01:13.448
(Whistles) Come on, Remi!

01:17.243 --> 01:18.453
(Gate clangs)

01:20.413 --> 01:22.874
- I am so sorry I'm late!

01:22.916 --> 01:24.918
Hi, sweetheart!

01:24.959 --> 01:27.712
- It's okay.
- Oh! It's not okay.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.756
It's your first day
back at work.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.716
- Well, if I leave right now,
I'll be fine.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.636
Although I'd much rather
stay here with you two.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.429
How am I gonna get through
a whole day

01:36.471 --> 01:38.515
without seeing this pretty
little face, huh?

01:38.556 --> 01:40.100
Or this one.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.644
Call if you need anything, okay?
- Okay.

01:42.686 --> 01:43.937
- There's beet and blueberry
puree in the fridge

01:43.978 --> 01:45.230
for her lunch.
- Okay.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.148
- And if you run out,
there's more in the freezer.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.650
- Got it.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.943
- But don't defrost it
in the microwave--

01:49.984 --> 01:51.736
- Ty...
- Okay.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.655
Send me pictures if she does
anything really cute.

01:53.697 --> 01:54.906
Or even mildly cute, or--
- You are--

01:54.948 --> 01:56.866
I will! (Laughs)

01:56.908 --> 01:59.494
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.329
- (Sighs)

02:03.039 --> 02:05.834
- No Lou, like I said,
you're good to go.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.252
The dude ranch is going
to be all--

02:08.294 --> 02:10.588
Yeah, okay, no worries.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.425
Good, I love you, bye.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.553
Oh... oh no.
- Yeah, let me guess,

02:16.594 --> 02:18.930
you haven't started cleaning up
the dude ranch yet.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.599
- No, Lou's got three guests
booked next week.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.686
- Yeah well, I guess you've got
a busy day ahead of you.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.312
- What's with the flowers?

02:26.354 --> 02:28.398
- Delivered here for Lisa.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.693
- From who?
- I don't know.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.362
- Well, it's not her birthday,
it's not a special occasion.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.448
You're not curious?

02:36.489 --> 02:38.199
- No.

02:40.785 --> 02:43.705
- What're you doing?
- I'll put it back.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.793
- Oh! French.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.588
Signed by... Fernand.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.381
Fer- (imitates French accent)
"Fernand."

02:53.423 --> 02:55.383
Does that name mean
anything to you?

02:55.425 --> 02:57.761
- No...

02:57.802 --> 02:59.554
Gimme that!

02:59.596 --> 03:01.765
Don't you have work to do
at the dude ranch?!

03:01.806 --> 03:03.516
- Yeah.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.769
- Well then, I suggest
you go do it.

03:05.810 --> 03:15.570
**

03:15.612 --> 03:16.738
(Door shuts)

03:17.864 --> 03:18.990
Arghh!

03:19.032 --> 03:21.242
(Car door shuts)

03:22.702 --> 03:24.412
- Agh.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.999
(Sighs heavily)

03:28.041 --> 03:30.627
(Sheets rustle)

03:30.669 --> 03:31.670
(Squawking sound, Tim gasps)

03:31.711 --> 03:33.588
(Squawks, sheet rustles)

03:35.632 --> 03:37.425
(Squawking, chittering)

03:39.844 --> 03:41.763
(Chittering)

03:44.099 --> 03:45.767
(Screeches loudly)

03:46.935 --> 03:48.770
(Door slams)

03:48.812 --> 03:51.439
(Squawking)

03:54.651 --> 03:55.777
(Wind rustles)

03:59.823 --> 04:01.783
(Hooves thud)

04:03.201 --> 04:06.746
(Horse snorts, pants)

04:06.788 --> 04:09.708
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hey.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.543
- So where do you want
to go today?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.503
- Change of plans, I don't...

04:13.545 --> 04:15.547
really feel like going out
for a ride today.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.298
- Oh, are-are you okay?

04:17.339 --> 04:19.676
- Yeah, yeah, I've just got
a lot on my mind.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.553
- Is it Val Stanton?

04:21.594 --> 04:24.222
I'd be a stress case too
if I had to jump her horse.

04:24.264 --> 04:28.018
She's extremely intense.
- No, it's not Val.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.811
- Okay, so what's going on?

04:32.856 --> 04:36.151
- (Sighs heavily)

04:36.192 --> 04:37.652
(Paper rustles)

04:42.073 --> 04:43.908
My brother sent this to me
a few days ago,

04:43.950 --> 04:46.703
I guess he's had it for a while.

04:46.745 --> 04:50.165
He was waiting until I was old
enough to read it.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.000
That guy in the photo -

04:53.835 --> 04:58.048
he's a drunk driver that killed
my parents 14-years-ago.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.467
His name's Charles Thackery.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.928
- Georgie...

05:03.970 --> 05:07.557
I don't even know what to say.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.100
- I looked him up online
yesterday,

05:09.142 --> 05:11.144
and I found some stuff.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.813
- What?
- His address.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.066
He lives just outside Hudson;
I'm gonna go see him.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.901
- I don't think that's such
a good idea.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.695
- No, I-I already made up
my mind.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.614
I'm gonna go see him
later today.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.116
I need to see him
with my own eyes.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.785
(Horse snorts)

05:31.206 --> 05:41.424
**

05:41.424 --> 05:46.846
**

05:46.888 --> 05:50.892
* And at the break of day
you sank into the dream *

05:53.853 --> 05:55.021
* You dreamer *

05:55.063 --> 05:57.941
* Oh oh oh oh *

05:57.982 --> 05:59.901
* You dreamer *

06:02.153 --> 06:07.075
* You dreamer *

06:12.706 --> 06:14.082
(Hooves clomp)

06:16.209 --> 06:17.919
(Truck rumbles)

06:23.967 --> 06:25.218
Lisa: Okay, so Mr. Davidson's
gonna come

06:25.260 --> 06:27.595
and pick up Midnight tomorrow,
let's have him all cleaned up,

06:27.637 --> 06:29.806
and the papers ready to go.
- Mhmm.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.142
- Thank you.
Jack: Morning!

06:32.183 --> 06:35.103
- Wow!
- Delivery for Lisa Stillman.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.730
- Well, that's a lovely
surprise,

06:36.771 --> 06:38.106
You didn't have to buy me
flowers!

06:38.148 --> 06:40.692
- Well, I didn't,
they're not from me.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.777
- Oh well, who are they from?

06:42.819 --> 06:44.946
- I don't know.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.407
- Let's see... oh.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.909
Oh, it's Fernand,
he's a local from Toulon,

06:49.951 --> 06:51.786
We talked investments
last time I was there,

06:51.828 --> 06:53.747
that's very sweet of him.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.124
- Very thoughtful of...
whatever you said his name was.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.626
- Fernand.
- Yeah, him.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.254
So that's all I came by for,

07:01.296 --> 07:03.298
so we'll see you
at the ranch for dinner.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.342
- Oh, you know what?
I don't think I can come.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.719
it's-it's-it's...
foaling season,

07:07.761 --> 07:09.095
and everything's so crazy here.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.889
- Well, shouldn't I be
giving you a hand?

07:10.930 --> 07:12.265
- No, no, no, no, I mean look,

07:12.307 --> 07:15.268
we've got-no, it's fine,
and I have to go.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.895
I'm sorry.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.646
(Sighs)

07:21.066 --> 07:23.902
Pete!
Pete: Yes, Ms. Stillman?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.988
(SUV rumbles)

07:30.283 --> 07:33.870
Jade: I don't know...
this doesn't feel right.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.747
- You didn't have to come
with me.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.957
- Yeah, like I was gonna let
you do this alone?

07:37.999 --> 07:40.794
- (Sighs) I just want
to see him, that's all.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.129
- Okay well, you've gotta have
something to say

07:43.171 --> 07:44.964
when he answers the door,
and I don't think

07:45.006 --> 07:47.008
"hey, aren't you the guy
who killed my parents"

07:47.050 --> 07:48.927
is gonna go over very well.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.179
- I'll just tell him I have
the wrong house or something.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.849
- Okay...

07:57.102 --> 07:59.020
- Be right back.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.023
(SUV door slams)

08:03.149 --> 08:05.860
(Footsteps thud)

08:09.823 --> 08:11.616
(Knocks)

08:16.913 --> 08:18.873
(Door creaks open)

08:19.749 --> 08:21.668
- Hey there.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.132
Can I do something for you?

08:27.173 --> 08:29.300
- Who is it, Charles?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.094
- I don't know.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.221
- Sorry, wrong-wrong house!

08:36.265 --> 08:38.643
(Charles and his wife laugh)

08:40.895 --> 08:42.897
- What happened?
(Engine turns, tires screech)

08:42.938 --> 08:44.065
- Georgie!

08:45.358 --> 08:47.027
(Engine revs)
Georgie, slow down!

08:47.068 --> 08:48.987
(Splintering)
Georgie!

08:49.029 --> 08:51.031
Charles: Hey!

08:51.072 --> 08:52.949
(Revving, tires screech)
Jade: What are you doing?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.743
- Hey, stop!

08:54.784 --> 08:56.661
(Revving)

08:58.705 --> 09:00.331
(Birds chirp)

09:00.373 --> 09:02.375
- Who's this guy?
Cass: He's a stray.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.086
Someone brought him in
a few days ago.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.963
I only thought I should play
with him because you know,

09:07.005 --> 09:08.423
it's important for his
adolescent development.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.216
- Right, that's a relief,

09:10.258 --> 09:11.843
'cause for a second there
I thought you were playing

09:11.885 --> 09:14.429
with him because he's
absolutely adorable.

09:14.471 --> 09:18.141
- Hardly, I see a lot of so
called adorable animals here,

09:18.183 --> 09:21.728
trust me, I am immune
to melting into a puddle.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.563
Come here.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.024
- You know, Cass,
you could always adopt him.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.942
I think you and Caleb would
make great pet owners.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.028
- I don't know...

09:30.070 --> 09:31.446
maybe one day.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.032
Now is definitely
not the right time.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.368
- I get it, puppies
are a huge commitment.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.911
It's like having a kid.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.871
It's not something
you wanna rush into.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.373
- Right.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.208
Exactly.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.585
(Puppy whines)

09:48.963 --> 09:51.049
(Knocking)
Caleb: Hey Amy, you home?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.551
- Caleb, shh! She's sleeping.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.513
- I'm sorry, I just came
to drop something off.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.473
- Oh, you didn't have
to do that.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.934
- Cass picked it out,
I hope she likes it.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.477
- Oh, she's gonna love it,
thank you.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.104
- You're welcome.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.022
- Well, I should get going.
- Actually, um...

10:06.064 --> 10:08.608
I really hate to ask,
but I promised Georgie

10:08.650 --> 10:10.568
I would do a schooling session
with her this morning,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.862
and my dad was gonna look
after Lyndy,

10:12.904 --> 10:14.322
but then he got stuck
at the dude ranch,

10:14.364 --> 10:16.116
and I was thinking...

10:16.157 --> 10:17.200
- Yeah, for sure.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.285
- It would just be for
half an hour or so.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.246
- There's nothing I'd rather do
than hang out

10:21.287 --> 10:22.914
with my favourite
miniature cowgirl.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.374
- I just put her down
for her nap

10:24.416 --> 10:26.292
so she shouldn't wake up,
but if she does,

10:26.334 --> 10:28.253
just text me,
I'll be right outside.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.839
- Okay, I got this. Relax.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.132
(Door opens)

10:32.173 --> 10:33.675
(Tupperware thunks)

10:36.136 --> 10:37.429
(Sniffs deeply)

10:37.470 --> 10:39.681
(Lyndy cries)

10:40.807 --> 10:42.183
- Amy?

10:43.476 --> 10:44.644
(Lyndy wails)

10:49.274 --> 10:52.027
(Crying)

10:55.155 --> 10:56.364
(Truck rumbles)

10:56.406 --> 11:00.035
- All right, I'm here,
what's this big emergency?

11:02.495 --> 11:05.040
- There's a skunk in that cabin.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.336
- A skunk?

11:09.377 --> 11:13.298
I just drove all the way
from Calgary for a skunk?

11:13.340 --> 11:15.133
You realize I don't work
here anymore?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.552
- And you do realize
that we paid you

11:17.594 --> 11:20.430
to winterize the dude ranch,
and you cashed the cheque.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.682
But if you had've done
the job correctly,

11:22.724 --> 11:24.267
the skunk never would've
gotten inside.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.102
So I figured the least
you'd wanna do

11:26.144 --> 11:29.189
is come out here and help me.
- Jack could help you.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.107
That's not why you called me,
so tell me why I'm here.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.486
- Allow me to repeat myself,
we paid you to do a job

11:34.527 --> 11:37.155
you didn't do.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.406
- Call a pest control company.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.450
- I'm not paying another guy
$300 bucks

11:40.492 --> 11:43.244
to fix your mistakes!

11:43.286 --> 11:45.413
Now let's do this.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.499
I don't have all day.
Close that.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.001
- (Frustrated exhale)

11:50.043 --> 11:51.252
(Slams)

11:52.379 --> 11:56.216
(Flame snorts)

11:56.257 --> 11:57.550
(Clatters)

11:57.592 --> 12:00.220
(Frustrated sigh)

12:00.261 --> 12:01.930
(Clatters)

12:03.223 --> 12:05.809
(Flame snorts)

12:05.850 --> 12:06.976
- That was terrible.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.937
- Your head doesn't seem
like it's in it today.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.563
Is everything okay?

12:10.605 --> 12:12.607
- Yeah, of course.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.109
- The jumps are higher
than you're used to,

12:14.150 --> 12:15.485
do you want me to lower them?

12:15.527 --> 12:18.071
- No, I've jumped these
high oxers before.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.407
- Okay, so what's
holding you back?

12:20.448 --> 12:23.660
- It's not me, it's Flame. He
just needs some time to adjust.

12:23.702 --> 12:27.455
- Well, nobody said this was
gonna be easy, right?

12:27.497 --> 12:29.082
I should go relieve Caleb
anyway,

12:29.124 --> 12:30.458
why don't we try
again tomorrow.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.794
- Thanks, Amy.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.464
(Sighs heavily)

12:36.506 --> 12:38.299
- So what's your deal?

12:38.341 --> 12:40.218
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.220
You know, I'm bettin' since
Amy is your mom,

12:42.262 --> 12:46.141
probably not gonna be into
the whole rodeo queen deal.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.143
Yeah, not for you.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.145
Championship barrel racer?

12:50.186 --> 12:53.023
I could see that,
the next Jade Virani.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.399
Those are some big cowgirl
boots to fill,

12:54.441 --> 12:57.527
but... I'd put my money
on you any day, kid.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.362
(Laughs)

12:59.404 --> 13:02.407
(Lyndy coos)

13:02.449 --> 13:05.076
- (Laughs)

13:05.118 --> 13:07.203
(Thuds)

13:07.245 --> 13:08.705
Mitch: Marshmallows?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.999
Have you done this before?
- What? They love these.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.168
If you don't have anything
good to say,

13:13.209 --> 13:14.544
don't say anything at all.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.088
- Look, you know, I didn't have
to come here today, right?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.423
- I'm well aware of that.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.176
And your fancy new job
in Calgary.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.511
How's the corporate world
treating you?

13:23.553 --> 13:26.222
- It's good... it's really-
it's really good.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.391
It couldn't be better.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.518
- Is it casual Friday?
- (Scoffs)

13:30.560 --> 13:33.104
- Lou's doing great,
by the way.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.647
Her Maggie's franchise
is about to take off

13:34.689 --> 13:37.108
thanks to a new investor.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.486
- Yeah, I know, Peter.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.364
- No, not Peter,
she turned Peter down.

13:43.698 --> 13:48.286
Not that you'd care, based on
your little disappearing act.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.205
(Trap clatters)

13:51.831 --> 13:52.999
- I think we are all set here.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.251
We'll just come back tomorrow,
and see if it worked.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.628
- Oh, I'd love to come
back tomorrow,

13:56.670 --> 13:58.672
but I think I already
have plans.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.591
- Yeah, you do, you're trapping
a skunk.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.219
Dress appropriately.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.223
- (Sighs)

14:09.516 --> 14:11.518
(Jeep rumbles)

14:12.727 --> 14:15.188
- (Sighs heavily)

14:15.230 --> 14:16.648
(Door slams)

14:16.690 --> 14:18.733
What're you doing here?

14:18.775 --> 14:20.735
- I was worried about you.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.529
- Jade, please don't make
a big deal out of this.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.239
- I'm pretty sure tracking down
the drunk driver

14:24.280 --> 14:26.324
who killed your biological
parents is like,

14:26.366 --> 14:27.617
the definition of a big deal.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.453
- It's done, so why do we have
to keep dwelling on it?

14:30.495 --> 14:33.206
And Lou's truck is fine,
there's not a scratch on it,

14:33.248 --> 14:35.291
so it's like it never
even happened.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.419
- Georgie, this isn't
the type of thing

14:37.460 --> 14:39.713
that you can just pretend
didn't happen.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.756
I think you should talk
to somebody about it.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.800
Your parents, or Jack.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.761
- No! And you promised
you wouldn't say anything.

14:46.803 --> 14:50.098
- I know, I just...
- A promise is a promise.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.436
- (Sighs)

14:54.477 --> 14:56.312
Georgie: You're not gonna kill
the skunk, are you?

14:56.354 --> 14:58.982
- Strictly a relocation
operation.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.192
<i>(Knocking)</i>

15:01.234 --> 15:03.903
- Oh! Right in the middle
of dinner.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.697
- You better stock up
on tomato juice.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.615
- Actually, that's an old
wives' tale.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.367
We get calls at the clinic
all the time

15:09.409 --> 15:10.952
when pets get skunked.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.288
We recommend just bathing them
in diluted peroxide.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.748
- Good advice.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.417
- So, we all remember
Constable Jones.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.753
- I'm sorry to interrupt
your dinner folks,

15:19.794 --> 15:22.339
but uh, there's a bit
of a situation.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.507
Amy: What kind of situation?

15:24.549 --> 15:25.800
- There's been a complaint
from a property owner

15:25.842 --> 15:28.261
just outside Hudson.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.222
He says that an SUV caused
some damage on his acreage.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.891
Now, we ran the plates,

15:32.932 --> 15:37.354
and the vehicle's registered
to Lou Fleming Morris.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.230
- I didn't mean to.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.523
I accidentally took
a wrong turn,

15:40.565 --> 15:42.609
and ended up at this
guy's place.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.861
I must've hit something
on my way out.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.197
It was an accident.
- Why didn't you say anything?

15:47.238 --> 15:48.698
- I don't know, I wasn't
thinking.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.408
Jack: I'll say you weren't.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.659
- The guy who made the
complaint said

15:51.701 --> 15:55.163
there were two girls in the
SUV. Both with brown hair.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.542
- I was there.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.211
- This has nothing to do
with Jade, though.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.796
- Georgie...

16:02.837 --> 16:05.215
- It was my fault,
I was driving. I'm sorry.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.676
I'll pay for the damages
I've caused.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.678
- All right then, I'll uh...

16:09.719 --> 16:11.763
I'll explain the situation
to the property owner,

16:11.805 --> 16:14.224
and see what he says.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.850
We'll talk in the morning?
- Yeah.

16:15.892 --> 16:18.353
Thanks, sorry about that.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.562
I'll see you out.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.356
(Sighs)

16:23.900 --> 16:25.985
(Police car rumbles away)

16:26.027 --> 16:28.613
Jack: Well, that wasn't
too pleasant.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.365
Are you sure you told him
everything?

16:32.742 --> 16:35.537
- Not everything.
- Jade, don't.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.331
- Georgie, is there something
that you're not telling us?

16:40.166 --> 16:42.043
- The property owner...

16:43.294 --> 16:45.463
his name's Charles Thackery.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.298
Amy: How do you know him?

16:47.340 --> 16:48.550
- I-I don't know him.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.053
- Show them the article.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.398
(Paper rustles)

17:08.862 --> 17:10.446
- Where'd you get this?

17:10.488 --> 17:12.323
- My brother sent it to me.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.075
- What's it say, Jack?

17:14.117 --> 17:18.413
- It appears Mr. Thackery
is the drunk driver that...

17:19.705 --> 17:22.083
who killed Georgie's parents.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.421
**

17:33.636 --> 17:35.597
(Knocking)

17:35.638 --> 17:36.431
- Come in.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.728
- I'm gonna turn in
for the night.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.355
- Jack, I...

17:44.522 --> 17:47.317
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

17:47.359 --> 17:49.569
- It's okay.

17:51.029 --> 17:54.199
I can't imagine what
it was like for you

17:54.240 --> 17:56.117
to read that article.

17:56.159 --> 17:59.287
- I promise I'll never try
and contact Charles ever again,

17:59.329 --> 18:00.955
I swear.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.041
- You just get some rest.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.793
Your dad's flying in
from Vancouver

18:04.834 --> 18:07.087
first thing in the morning.
- You called him?

18:07.128 --> 18:09.923
- He's your dad, Georgie,
of course I called him,

18:09.964 --> 18:13.385
he's worried about you,
so is your mom.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.387
- They don't need to be.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.013
It was a stupid mistake,

18:17.055 --> 18:18.890
I wanna forget it ever
happened.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.142
- I understand why you might
feel that way,

18:21.184 --> 18:24.938
but you can't put the genie
back in the bottle now,

18:24.979 --> 18:28.400
you're gonna have to deal
with this.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.320
You all right?

18:35.699 --> 18:37.659
Okay, good night.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.287
(Door creaks shut)

18:44.624 --> 18:46.626
- (Sighs heavily)

18:48.962 --> 18:50.463
- You know, before she came
to Heartland,

18:50.505 --> 18:52.424
Georgie was in the foster
system.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.676
That couldn't have been
what her parents wanted.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.720
- Well, her parents probably
didn't have a legal will.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.888
- Neither do we.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.016
- Yeah, but we got
plenty of family,

19:01.057 --> 19:02.142
if anything ever happened
to us,

19:02.183 --> 19:04.394
Lyndy would have lots of people
to look after her.

19:04.436 --> 19:08.356
- I'm sure that's what her
parents thought, too.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.650
- You're right.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.069
We'll make an appointment
with a lawyer... soon.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.613
Like, tomorrow.
- (Laughs)

19:15.655 --> 19:17.407
So then, who are we
going to appoint

19:17.449 --> 19:19.325
as our legal guardians?

19:21.786 --> 19:24.497
- Uh, I don't know,
maybe Jack and Lisa?

19:24.539 --> 19:28.793
- Grandpa's not exactly
as young as he used to be.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.503
- Well, there's always
Tim and Casey.

19:30.545 --> 19:33.131
Or your sister.
- Hmm...

19:33.173 --> 19:37.093
- Yeah, but she's kind of all
over the map these days.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.888
- What about Caleb
and Cassandra?

19:41.514 --> 19:44.100
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.436
Caleb was over here today,
he helped me look after Lyndy

19:46.478 --> 19:48.104
when I was out coaching Georgie.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.856
He was really great
with her Ty,

19:49.898 --> 19:52.150
it was pretty cute.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.985
- Well, there is a big
difference between babysitting

19:54.027 --> 19:56.488
and raising a child.
- (Half laughs)

19:56.529 --> 19:57.947
- Just today at work
Cass was saying

19:57.989 --> 20:00.116
that they're not ready
to adopt a puppy,

20:00.158 --> 20:02.369
so I'm thinking a kid's
out of the question.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.788
- Yeah, I see your point.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.331
- We don't have
to decide tonight,

20:06.373 --> 20:08.291
we can sleep on it, you know?

20:08.333 --> 20:09.834
- Okay.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.878
(Lyndy cries)

20:11.920 --> 20:13.838
(Amy laughs)

20:13.880 --> 20:15.507
If only sleep were an option.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.301
- Hey, I've got it, I got it.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.761
(Amy sighs)

20:23.682 --> 20:25.850
(Drill whirs)

20:25.892 --> 20:27.769
(Truck rumbles)

20:31.773 --> 20:34.025
- Hello there.
- Howdy.

20:34.067 --> 20:37.237
- You must be Charles Thackery?
- I am.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.989
- My name's Jack Bartlett.
- Nice to meet you, Jack.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.617
- Well, it seems my great
granddaughter

20:42.659 --> 20:45.995
paid you a visit yesterday.
- Look...

20:46.037 --> 20:48.081
I think I'd rather let
the police deal with this.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.958
- And that's your right,
I suppose,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.669
but I'm hoping you'll change
your mind.

20:52.711 --> 20:53.837
- I don't think so.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.673
- Well, just let me explain.

20:56.715 --> 21:01.094
Our family adopted Georgie
about five years back.

21:01.136 --> 21:04.973
Her birth parents
are Matt and Mary Crawley.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.688
- I think you should go.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.314
(Coughs) No, I-I...

21:15.025 --> 21:16.985
please.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.705
(Truck door slams)

21:28.747 --> 21:30.999
(Truck starts, rumbles away)

21:32.709 --> 21:33.960
(Sighs heavily)

21:34.002 --> 21:35.337
Peter: Knock, knock.

21:36.546 --> 21:40.258
- Oh! Dad!
- Hey...

21:40.300 --> 21:42.594
So I talked to Constable Jones
this morning.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.888
Apparently Charles is...

21:44.929 --> 21:47.098
gonna drop the complaint
about the property damage.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.516
- Really? Why?

21:48.558 --> 21:49.934
- I don't know, he didn't say.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.227
- That's good,

21:51.269 --> 21:52.937
I mean, I know you're probably
still gonna ground me,

21:52.979 --> 21:54.439
but at least the police
aren't involved anymore.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.107
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

21:56.149 --> 21:59.903
I didn't come here to punish
you, you realize that, right?

21:59.944 --> 22:02.405
I came here to make sure
you're okay, sweetheart.

22:02.447 --> 22:03.656
- I'm fine.

22:03.698 --> 22:05.742
You didn't have to come
all the way from Vancouver

22:05.784 --> 22:08.995
just to check on me.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.747
- I know that you didn't
know your birth parents,

22:10.789 --> 22:12.832
but it must've come
as quite a shock

22:12.874 --> 22:14.709
to read that article, right?

22:14.751 --> 22:17.253
- I'm late for my shift, so if
I'm not grounded, then...

22:17.295 --> 22:18.672
- No, you're not grounded.
- Okay.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.215
- I'll give you a ride.
- I can drive myself.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.966
- Wait- oh right, I forgot.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.385
- Yeah, see 'ya.

22:25.679 --> 22:28.598
(Birds chirp, horse whinnies)

22:28.640 --> 22:31.643
- Gait looks pretty good.
- Yeah.

22:31.685 --> 22:33.853
- Thank you so much for
lending a hand today,

22:33.895 --> 22:36.773
it's been so crazy around here,
I need all the help I can get.

22:36.815 --> 22:39.275
- You know I'm more than happy
to pitch in.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.111
Besides, I wanted to give
Peter and Georgie

22:41.152 --> 22:42.737
a little time on their own.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.197
- Oh yeah, how is Georgie?

22:44.239 --> 22:46.616
- Oh, I think she'll be okay,
at least now that Peter's here.

22:46.658 --> 22:48.076
- Sure.
Man: Lisa!

22:48.118 --> 22:50.620
- Oh, shoot!

22:50.662 --> 22:52.664
Shoot!

22:52.706 --> 22:54.124
- Who's that?
- Mr. Davidson.

22:54.165 --> 22:58.044
He's picking up a horse,
but he's two hours early.

22:58.086 --> 23:00.088
Lisa: Hi!
Mr. Davidson: Hey.

23:01.548 --> 23:04.592
(Cell phone rings)

23:15.812 --> 23:17.772
- Hah! It worked!

23:19.024 --> 23:20.900
I mean-I mean,
of course it worked.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.902
- Yeah... great. It worked.

23:22.944 --> 23:24.904
Now what are we gonna do?
If we get near the thing,

23:24.946 --> 23:26.322
it's just gonna spray us.

23:26.364 --> 23:29.159
- You just uh...
you cover the...

23:29.200 --> 23:30.785
cage with a blanket.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.292
(Skunk hisses, screeches)

23:37.334 --> 23:41.046
Both: Ugh! Oh! Ewww!
Oh! Ohhhh!

23:41.087 --> 23:43.423
- (Coughs) Oh ho!
Oh, that is nasty.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.425
- Yeah well, it's on the
blanket and not on us.

23:45.467 --> 23:48.219
So stop being a baby,
get in there and get the cage.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.472
- What?! Ohhh!

23:51.598 --> 23:53.975
Okay... (coughs)

23:54.017 --> 23:56.895
All right well, where are we
gonna put this thing?

23:56.936 --> 23:58.271
- "We?" We're not going
to put it anywhere.

23:58.313 --> 24:00.148
You are gonna take it out
to the wildlife reserve

24:00.190 --> 24:01.691
and you're gonna set it free.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.026
- Oh! Wait! Oh-
(Skunk sprays)

24:03.068 --> 24:04.402
(Coughs) And you're not
coming with me?!

24:04.444 --> 24:06.905
- I have plans, I've got a date
with my youngest granddaughter.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.656
Bring the cage back
when you're done.

24:08.698 --> 24:10.700
- Tim- oh- (coughs, gags)

24:10.742 --> 24:12.077
Oh! Ti-- (Gags)

24:12.118 --> 24:13.620
(Retches)

24:14.871 --> 24:17.791
- Hey, Jack.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.292
- Peter!
- Hey.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.169
- Sorry, good to see you!

24:21.211 --> 24:22.921
- Yeah, you too.
- How'd it go with Georgie?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.839
- Uh...

24:24.881 --> 24:26.174
Yeah, not too good, honestly.

24:26.216 --> 24:27.926
She told me I should've
stayed in Vancouver.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.303
- I'm sure she'll come around.

24:30.345 --> 24:32.389
Tim: General!
Nice of you to drop in,

24:32.430 --> 24:34.182
and help with your
daughter's crisis.

24:34.224 --> 24:36.309
- Really not in the mood,
Tim, honestly.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.770
- You stink.

24:38.812 --> 24:42.607
- It's not that bad.
- It ain't good.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.150
- Honey, where's Lyndy?

24:44.192 --> 24:45.652
I thought I was gonna take
care of her

24:45.694 --> 24:47.237
while you coached Georgie.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.322
- She's just napping, and
Georgie's not back yet, anyway.

24:49.364 --> 24:52.283
You smell worse than a bag
of dirty diapers!

24:52.325 --> 24:55.370
- I got a skunk out
of a dude ranch cabin,

24:55.412 --> 24:57.205
and saved 300 bucks, okay?

24:59.207 --> 25:01.710
Any luck finding anything
out about Fernand?

25:01.751 --> 25:03.545
- Fernand?

25:03.586 --> 25:04.838
- (Sighs)

25:04.879 --> 25:08.133
- Fernand's a French guy.
He sent flowers to Lisa.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.468
- You're making it sound
way worse than it is.

25:10.510 --> 25:14.180
Hey, the flowers were just
a thank you gift.

25:14.222 --> 25:15.890
- For what?

25:15.932 --> 25:18.059
- I don't know, it's none
of my business.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.020
And it's none of yours, either!

25:20.061 --> 25:21.813
- You know, Jack, you can look
people up on the internet

25:21.855 --> 25:23.565
these days, and find out
all about them.

25:23.606 --> 25:26.234
And Peter has a laptop,
you should look up Fernand.

25:26.276 --> 25:28.445
- No, no, I don't think so.
- Look up Fernand, just do it!

25:28.486 --> 25:31.448
- No. No, he does... no.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.950
And you need more than just
a first name to do a search.

25:33.992 --> 25:36.077
You can't just search
"Fernand."

25:36.119 --> 25:38.455
Jack: LeForte.

25:38.496 --> 25:41.207
Fernand LeForte, with an "e."

25:41.249 --> 25:44.586
In Toulon, France,
is that enough to go on?

25:45.879 --> 25:49.299
- Yeah, no yeah, sure, we can...

25:49.341 --> 25:51.426
yeah, that's totally enough.

25:51.468 --> 25:53.345
- LeForte.
- Yep, I got it, Tim.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.096
- With an "e."
- Thank you.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.598
(Sighs, keys click)

25:58.224 --> 26:00.393
(Computer beeps)

26:00.435 --> 26:02.937
Oh, hmm, yep,
there we go, uh...

26:05.315 --> 26:08.818
it looks like Fernand here
is a real estate agent.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.738
- Yeah, the world's best
looking real estate agent.

26:11.780 --> 26:14.324
- What?
(Lyndy grunts)

26:14.366 --> 26:16.326
- I'll-I'll do that,
I'll look after her.

26:16.368 --> 26:18.703
- Yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm... joining you.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.039
- Wait--

26:21.081 --> 26:22.916
(Sighs heavily)

26:22.957 --> 26:24.959
<i>(Knock on door)</i>

26:35.220 --> 26:37.347
- I'd like to talk to Georgie.

26:37.389 --> 26:39.933
**

26:44.229 --> 26:46.648
- Just hold on now.

26:49.109 --> 26:52.070
I'm not sure you should be here.

26:52.112 --> 26:55.323
- Look, I'm sorry about before.

26:55.365 --> 26:58.034
But I just want a chance
to make amends with Georgie,

26:58.076 --> 27:00.245
Or... or at least try.

27:02.414 --> 27:05.959
Okay, look.

27:06.001 --> 27:09.254
That's how you get
in touch with me.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.840
- I'm not making any promises.

27:15.927 --> 27:17.178
- Yep.

27:18.471 --> 27:20.348
(Keys jingle)

27:27.564 --> 27:30.859
- I'm gonna make some more
coffee, Jack, you want some?

27:32.902 --> 27:34.696
- You need to see this.

27:36.948 --> 27:38.408
- Where'd you get that?

27:38.450 --> 27:41.786
- From Charles,
he was just at the door.

27:43.204 --> 27:46.458
- What'd he want?
- To meet with Georgie.

27:46.499 --> 27:49.794
He said he wants to make amends.

27:53.965 --> 27:55.342
Ty: What's going on in here?

27:55.383 --> 27:57.927
- Hey! Well, Cass was talking
about this little guy so much,

27:57.969 --> 28:00.347
I decided to come see what
all the fuss was about.

28:00.388 --> 28:03.266
- If it's not too late,
we'd really like to adopt him.

28:03.308 --> 28:05.560
- Please tell me
it's not too late.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.354
- It's not too late.

28:07.395 --> 28:09.314
- Oh my God, that's so great!
Yeah!

28:09.356 --> 28:10.607
You're coming home with us,
Jasper!

28:10.648 --> 28:13.276
Yes, you are! We're-- um...

28:13.318 --> 28:15.445
We-uh, we named him Jasper.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.155
- It's a good name,
it suits him.

28:17.197 --> 28:19.908
- (Laughs) Thanks, um...

28:19.949 --> 28:21.951
Okay, well, I have to go.

28:21.993 --> 28:24.287
I have a vet call,
but I won't be too long.

28:24.329 --> 28:25.747
- All right, well,
take your time.

28:25.789 --> 28:27.248
We'll just be here getting
to know each other.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.542
- Okay, bye.

28:29.584 --> 28:31.628
- Bye.
- Bye!

28:31.670 --> 28:33.254
- Bye, bye, mamma!
- Bye.

28:33.296 --> 28:36.132
(Both chuckle)

28:36.174 --> 28:39.135
(Flame pants)

28:39.177 --> 28:41.971
(Squeals, whinnies)
Georgie: Hey! Easy.

28:42.013 --> 28:43.390
(Flame whinnies)

28:45.558 --> 28:47.769
(Hooves thud)

28:52.148 --> 28:53.650
(Clatters, Georgie groans)

28:53.692 --> 28:56.653
- Okay Georgie, bring it in.
- I wanna go again.

28:56.695 --> 28:59.072
- We haven't made much
progress since yesterday.

28:59.114 --> 29:01.533
Maybe we should wait until you
have a little less on your mind.

29:01.574 --> 29:04.744
- I wish everyone would stop
assuming I'm a wreck!

29:04.786 --> 29:07.288
I can do the jumps, we just
need to school Flame harder.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.874
- Georgie,
Flame can make these jumps.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.334
And so can you.

29:11.376 --> 29:13.086
But something's holding
you back.

29:13.128 --> 29:16.631
- I'm not the problem,
Flame is, anyone can see that.

29:16.673 --> 29:19.134
I've got some homework to do,
I'm going back to the house.

29:22.345 --> 29:24.222
- Hey.

29:24.264 --> 29:26.474
(Flame nickers)

29:33.440 --> 29:35.900

**

30:21.571 --> 30:23.198
- (Sighs heavily)

30:26.242 --> 30:29.454
- Hey Tim, I dropped that
skunk off at the...

30:29.496 --> 30:31.122
wildlife reserve.

30:31.164 --> 30:33.249
I put the cage over
by your truck.

30:33.291 --> 30:35.460
The duvet is there as well,
but honestly,

30:35.502 --> 30:37.212
you're gonna wanna throw
that thing out,

30:37.253 --> 30:39.673
it stinks to high heaven.
- Good job.

30:39.714 --> 30:41.341
- Look, maybe you could do me
a favour too,

30:41.383 --> 30:44.094
and not mention to Lou
that I was here.

30:44.135 --> 30:46.471
I'd rather let
sleeping dogs lie.

30:49.766 --> 30:51.559
- You know, just 'cause things
went south with you and Lou

30:51.601 --> 30:54.229
didn't mean you had
to quit your job.

30:55.563 --> 30:58.650
- Well, it was just...
it was time to move on.

30:58.692 --> 31:00.610
So I moved on.

31:00.652 --> 31:03.238
- Hmm, too bad.

31:05.532 --> 31:08.410
Jack really liked having
you around.

31:12.205 --> 31:14.874
Thanks for your help, Trooper.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.511
(Crickets chirp)

31:31.349 --> 31:33.101

32:29.908 --> 32:32.994
What are you doing up?
- Can't sleep.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.372

32:41.920 --> 32:43.546
Tell me something,
when was the last time you had

32:43.588 --> 32:46.675
a good night's rest?

32:46.716 --> 32:49.094
- I don't know.

32:52.722 --> 32:54.516
I just keep thinking...

32:55.809 --> 32:58.603
about how different
things could be.

33:00.772 --> 33:05.193
If he didn't decide to drink
and drive that day.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.364

33:11.658 --> 33:14.244
So...

33:14.285 --> 33:17.539
Charles actually came by
the ranch earlier.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.792
Now I've been debating whether
or not to even say

33:20.834 --> 33:23.962
anything to you about this,
but...

33:24.004 --> 33:27.966
he wants to know if you'll give
him a chance to make amends.

33:28.008 --> 33:30.635
Now, you 100%
don't have to do that.

33:32.595 --> 33:36.307
I mean, I'm not even sure how
I feel about you doing it.

33:36.349 --> 33:37.225
But I do know...

33:38.727 --> 33:42.939
that sometimes in order
to get past something,

33:42.981 --> 33:46.735
the best thing to do
is just to face it head on.

33:46.776 --> 33:49.654
But it's your call, sweetheart.

33:49.696 --> 33:53.241
Okay? Whatever you want
to do is fine.

33:59.414 --> 34:00.874
- It's definitely not
going to be Tim.

34:00.915 --> 34:03.376
- I agree.
He is an amazing grandfather,

34:03.418 --> 34:06.254
but he's not the right choice
for the legal guardian.

34:06.296 --> 34:08.505
- So we've ruled out Jack
and Tim now.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.176
- So I guess that leaves Lou.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.344
- Yep.

34:13.386 --> 34:16.348
Although...
- What?

34:16.389 --> 34:17.974
- Something happened
yesterday at work,

34:18.016 --> 34:21.811
and I'm starting to lean
in a different direction.

34:21.853 --> 34:24.606
(Lyndy coos)

34:24.647 --> 34:27.108
Lisa: You seem very
quiet today.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.904
- Oh, well...

34:30.945 --> 34:33.656
there's something I need
to get off my chest, I guess.

34:33.697 --> 34:36.659
- Okay.

34:36.701 --> 34:41.039
- I have been trying real hard
not to let the fact

34:41.081 --> 34:45.835
that another man bought flowers
for my wife bother me,

34:45.877 --> 34:48.170
but I am failing miserably.

34:48.213 --> 34:51.591
- (Laughs)
- Now...

34:51.632 --> 34:54.844
I know that may seem petty
and jealous,

34:54.886 --> 34:56.679
but I'm hoping you'll cut me
some slack,

34:56.721 --> 35:00.141
since I don't think you've been
completely honest with me.

35:02.686 --> 35:04.396
- (Sighs)

35:06.856 --> 35:10.360
- I am broke.

35:10.402 --> 35:11.778
- What?

35:11.820 --> 35:14.989
- Not totally,
but very nearly.

35:15.031 --> 35:18.702
And I'm having a hard time
keeping my business afloat.

35:18.743 --> 35:20.537
People just aren't buying
expensive horses

35:20.578 --> 35:22.664
like they used to, so...

35:23.957 --> 35:27.043
My accountant has suggested
that I lay off

35:27.085 --> 35:29.921
some of my trainers
and my stable hands,

35:29.963 --> 35:32.716
and I don't want to, I can't!

35:32.757 --> 35:34.342
They have mortgages,
and they have families,

35:34.384 --> 35:36.386
and I- so...

35:36.428 --> 35:38.513
- So you're selling your house
in France,

35:38.555 --> 35:41.057
and he's your real estate agent.

35:41.099 --> 35:43.810
- He sent me the flowers
because he was hoping

35:43.852 --> 35:45.687
for a big, fat commission.

35:45.729 --> 35:47.105
- Oh!
- That's it!

35:47.147 --> 35:49.607
- But why didn't you tell me
this in the first place?

35:49.649 --> 35:51.985
- Well...

35:52.027 --> 35:55.447
I-it's difficult to talk
about money with you,

35:56.781 --> 35:59.576
I feel like it's an elephant
in the room,

35:59.617 --> 36:01.494
and you know what,
it doesn't even matter

36:01.536 --> 36:03.580
because I'm not selling
the house,

36:03.621 --> 36:05.582
I'm going to rent it instead,

36:05.623 --> 36:07.083
And I'm gonna use all
the rental money

36:07.125 --> 36:09.127
to keep the lights on here,

36:09.169 --> 36:11.755
and so really,
nothing's changing.

36:11.796 --> 36:12.839
- Well, that's not true,

36:12.881 --> 36:15.842
you can't live in a house
that's rented out.

36:15.884 --> 36:19.095
and I know how much your time
in France means to you.

36:19.137 --> 36:22.557
- Well, I'm not expecting a lot
of sympathy from people

36:22.599 --> 36:26.603
that I have to rent my house
in France, boo hoo!

36:26.644 --> 36:28.897
Cry me a river, right?

36:28.938 --> 36:31.858
- Times are tough for a lot
of people right now.

36:33.276 --> 36:35.779
Well, the very fact that you're
keeping your business going,

36:35.820 --> 36:38.573
and all your staff employed

36:38.615 --> 36:40.575
doesn't make me feel
sympathy for you,

36:40.617 --> 36:42.410
it makes me feel proud.

36:45.455 --> 36:47.624
- Thank you.

36:47.665 --> 36:48.875
(Sighs)

36:52.962 --> 36:55.423
- Okay, yeah I will, Lou.

36:55.465 --> 36:57.342
I promise.

36:57.384 --> 36:59.302
Okay, I love you too.

36:59.344 --> 37:01.346
Bye.

37:01.388 --> 37:04.516
- Okay, are you ready?

37:06.101 --> 37:08.478
Listen, you don't have
to go downstairs

37:08.520 --> 37:11.231
if you don't want to,
you know that, right?

37:12.524 --> 37:13.942
- No, I... I'm ready.

37:16.069 --> 37:18.279
- Okay.

37:22.242 --> 37:24.911
(Floorboard creaks,
readying exhale)

37:25.995 --> 37:27.789
- (Sighs)

37:29.624 --> 37:43.054
**

37:43.096 --> 37:45.473
(Peter sighs)

37:45.515 --> 37:47.308
- Hello, Georgie.

37:58.862 --> 38:02.032
- I uh, I don't really know
where to begin.

38:02.073 --> 38:03.825
Um... um...

38:05.785 --> 38:07.996
I'm not here to make excuses.

38:11.249 --> 38:14.961
I was 19-years-old
when I got into my car drunk.

38:15.003 --> 38:16.796
Old enough to know better.

38:17.881 --> 38:19.591
And uh...

38:21.343 --> 38:24.346
I'm sure the two years
I spent in jail

38:27.265 --> 38:29.601
don't seem like enough to you.

38:31.061 --> 38:32.687
And you're right.

38:33.897 --> 38:35.482
I deserved worse.

38:36.858 --> 38:40.528
But I'm not the same person
I was 14-years-ago.

38:43.990 --> 38:46.034
And I know...

38:48.203 --> 38:51.623
what I took away from you and
your brother is unforgivable,

38:58.338 --> 39:01.549
but I want you to know
how sorry I am.

39:05.637 --> 39:08.014
- Was that your kid?

39:08.056 --> 39:11.518
The one I saw
when I came to your door?

39:12.977 --> 39:13.520
- Yeah.

39:16.481 --> 39:18.400
That's my daughter.

39:19.818 --> 39:22.696
She's 14-months-old,
her name is Jillian.

39:23.947 --> 39:25.740
- That's a pretty name.

39:27.992 --> 39:30.704
- Thank you.

39:30.745 --> 39:33.998
- I guess I was just a little
older than Jillian when my...

39:35.709 --> 39:38.086
when I lost my parents.

39:41.756 --> 39:44.926
I don't remember
my life with them in it.

39:46.845 --> 39:49.139
I only remember my life
without them,

39:49.180 --> 39:50.557
and it was...

39:51.808 --> 39:54.936
it was pretty bad
before I came here.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.774
- (Sighs heavily)

40:01.776 --> 40:05.071
- I can't forgive you for
something I don't remember,

40:09.909 --> 40:13.455
but you can make me
a promise instead.

40:16.791 --> 40:19.794
- (Deep, tearful breath)
Yeah, all right.

40:22.297 --> 40:26.134
- Promise you'll tell Jillian
you love her, every day.

40:29.054 --> 40:31.765
even when she stains the carpet
with her grape juice,

40:31.806 --> 40:34.100
or puts in the dry wall
because she did three

40:34.142 --> 40:35.643
cartwheels in a row.

40:39.022 --> 40:41.483
And when she's a teenager,

40:42.942 --> 40:45.695
be the kind of dad that'll...

40:45.737 --> 40:47.614
fly in from anywhere,

40:48.782 --> 40:50.367
just to be there for her.

40:50.408 --> 40:54.496
Even when she pretends she
doesn't want him there.

40:56.122 --> 40:58.667
Because the truth is...

40:58.708 --> 41:00.794
she needs him,

41:02.671 --> 41:05.006
and she loves him,

41:07.801 --> 41:10.011
even though she doesn't
say it enough.

41:14.766 --> 41:15.850
(Sighs)

41:19.145 --> 41:20.480
- I...

41:21.731 --> 41:23.858
I promise.

41:26.695 --> 41:28.988
- (Sighs)

41:29.030 --> 41:41.793
**

41:41.835 --> 41:44.129
(Sighs)

41:44.170 --> 41:47.090
- So you're probably wondering
what all this is about.

41:47.132 --> 41:48.591
- We wanted to ask you
something.

41:48.633 --> 41:50.343
- You see, Amy and I

41:50.385 --> 41:52.012
are putting together a will
right now,

41:52.053 --> 41:54.347
- And we need to appoint
a legal guardian

41:54.389 --> 41:57.392
for our daughter just in case
anything should happen to us.

41:57.434 --> 41:58.977
- So we were hoping that
you two would agree

41:59.019 --> 42:02.063
to be Lyndy's guardians.

42:02.105 --> 42:04.482
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah, definitely.

42:04.524 --> 42:06.484
- Not that anything would ever
happen to you guys.

42:06.526 --> 42:08.361
- Of course not,
but if it ever did,

42:08.403 --> 42:10.155
we'd love her like she was
our own daughter.

42:10.196 --> 42:12.907
- Yeah.
(Lydny coos)

42:12.949 --> 42:15.035
- Aw, you hear that?
Did you hear that?

42:15.076 --> 42:17.245
- Thanks, Caleb.
(Lyndy laughs)

42:19.456 --> 42:22.125
- Yep, that's right, Lou.

42:22.167 --> 42:27.005
I saved us 300 bucks getting
rid of that skunk on my own.

42:27.047 --> 42:30.717
Nope! No, it doesn't smell
like skunk in here.

42:32.093 --> 42:34.262
Well, I covered it with
a blanket over the cage

42:34.304 --> 42:35.722
before it sprayed.

42:37.474 --> 42:39.601
Just the one from the bed.

42:41.227 --> 42:44.856
Duvet, blanket,
whatever you wanna call it.

42:44.898 --> 42:47.317
Yeah, I can replace it.

42:47.359 --> 42:49.402
(Laughs) $600?

42:49.444 --> 42:52.822
No, I'm not replacing
the whole bed.

42:52.864 --> 42:56.368
$600 for the duvet?!

42:56.409 --> 42:58.203
* If you don't let go *

43:00.997 --> 43:03.124
* You're never gonna know *

43:05.085 --> 43:06.961
* Don't be sad *

43:09.130 --> 43:11.299
* And never look back *

43:12.967 --> 43:15.637
* If you don't let go *

43:17.430 --> 43:20.266
* You're never gonna know *

43:21.476 --> 43:23.645
* Don't be sad *

43:25.480 --> 43:28.149
* And never look back *

43:32.070 --> 43:34.239
(Hooves thud, Flame snorts)
