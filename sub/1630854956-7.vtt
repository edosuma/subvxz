WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:06.040
In recent weeks we have all seen things
that should not be.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.880
And yet are.

00:09.960 --> 00:14.680
Something that has "weaponized"
the seas against us.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.320
That what's happening in the sea
is in some way

00:19.560 --> 00:22.040
is a reaction
to what we have done to it.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.120
This could be a very dangerous road
to be going down.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.160
We don't have time for caution.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.200
This new intelligence,
could I ask what you are calling it?

00:33.440 --> 00:36.760
For the time being
I have taken to calling them: the yrr.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.520
We picked up the same signal.
In the Artic Ocean.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.680
I can't guarantee,
we will make it back alive, so...

01:30.240 --> 01:34.120
The sounds we picked up
were concentrated in the Arctic

01:34.280 --> 01:36.000
and the Antarctic.

01:36.600 --> 01:40.520
Logic dictates that a person, or animal,

01:40.680 --> 01:45.160
is more likely to send messages
from the places they frequent the most.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.480
And I think we can
assume the same for the Yrr.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.680
Are you suggesting that the Yrr
have some sort of home?

01:53.840 --> 01:56.840
I don't think we have enough information
to make that assumption.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.760
We can assume that the Yrr,

01:58.920 --> 02:02.360
just like any highly evolved marine
species, have a breeding ground.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.760
And if they do,
it's probably not a single site.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.040
It's probably several,
to ensure their survival.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.720
Which you believe would also be
in the Arctic or Antarctic?

02:11.160 --> 02:12.560
We do.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.960
If there is a breeding ground,

02:15.120 --> 02:17.200
we expect it would require
high ambient pressure

02:17.440 --> 02:20.160
that would be essential
to their reproductive biology.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.400
My guess,

02:22.560 --> 02:24.360
from what we've seen here to date,

02:24.520 --> 02:28.320
is that it would be a minimum of five
to five-point-five kilometers down.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.880
Okay, Charlie. You're up.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.720
Given the decline in sea ice,
several areas in the Arctic have become

02:38.960 --> 02:40.720
more accessible from the world above.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.280
One of these areas is the Molloy Deep,

02:45.880 --> 02:50.160
which is just over
five-point-five kilometers in depth,

02:50.400 --> 02:54.200
and is one of the areas
where Sam picked up the most signals.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.120
The Yrr could have been
living at these ocean depths

02:58.360 --> 03:01.720
for tens, even hundreds
of millions of years.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.800
Undisturbed and unknown.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.800
You think we should plot a course
to the Molloy Deep?

03:08.040 --> 03:09.400
We do.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.520
The ice tends to scatter
and absorb sound.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.160
We need to run a test to see
if our equipment is strong enough

03:14.320 --> 03:15.760
to broadcast through it.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.840
We should start seeing some ice
when we enter the Arctic Ocean.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.680
We can run the tests then.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.440
We can take the HOV out
for a test run at the same time.

03:26.680 --> 03:30.040
Before we meet this thing,
we better be ready for it.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.080
In addition to the interviews
with all on board,

03:41.240 --> 03:43.760
you will be keeping
written logs as well?

03:43.920 --> 03:44.920
Yes.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.600
And I'll upload all the interviews
at the end of the day to your server.

03:48.760 --> 03:53.560
Along with the next-of-kin, emergency
contact details of all onboard.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.240
I'm sure their families
will appreciate it.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.720
I'll upload the written logs
at the same time.

03:59.960 --> 04:04.920
I hope I will never need them,
but in the event you don't return...

04:06.200 --> 04:08.240
The record of Dr. Johanson's mission

04:08.840 --> 04:11.240
and all who joined it must be preserved.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.680
For the information it contains,
and the history we create.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.960
We have cameras on the main deck,
engine room, hangar,

04:27.120 --> 04:29.320
anywhere on the ship there's activity,

04:29.480 --> 04:32.640
so we can keep an eye on
what's going on during deployments,

04:32.800 --> 04:34.480
catch any problems before they happen.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.720
If you wanna take a look at the footage,

04:37.320 --> 04:39.880
if you wanna use it in your reports,
you clear it with me.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.040
I will.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.160
Please.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.720
If you want to film the crew,
you ask me.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.360
You want to film in a cabin, the galley,

04:54.520 --> 04:57.200
elsewhere on the ship, you ask me.

04:57.800 --> 04:58.840
Yes, sir.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.960
We're charting the course...

05:01.120 --> 05:02.840
Life on a ship's a fishbowl,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.720
even without cameras
poking into everyone's business.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.560
-Understood?
-Understood.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.000
Mr. Kofi, seventy-nine degrees,
eight-point-one two minutes north,

05:15.160 --> 05:18.000
zero two degrees
forty-nine-point-zero east.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.680
-Roger that, Captain.
-One question.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.080
When am I getting an interview with you?

05:25.640 --> 05:29.520
-As soon as I find a moment.
-And when exactly will that be?

05:29.760 --> 05:32.720
-Maybe tomorrow I'll find some time.
-I'll hold you to that.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.680
-And it's "Yes, Captain," not "sir."
-Yes, Captain.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.400
We established that
the signal we picked up

05:40.560 --> 05:43.040
is likely to have come
from an "intelligence."

05:43.200 --> 05:44.680
The challenge now

05:44.920 --> 05:47.000
is to let them know we can hear them.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.200
And, if they respond,

05:49.440 --> 05:52.120
to create the building blocks
by which we can communicate.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.400
But, given the increasing severity
of the attacks,

05:57.120 --> 06:00.440
there's a pretty good chance
we'll die before we get to do that.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.480
-Can you try and be a bit less...
-What?

06:07.080 --> 06:10.160
-Defeatist?
-Why sugarcoat it?

06:10.320 --> 06:14.360
Maybe say something like:
"The mission isn't without its dangers

06:14.520 --> 06:16.600
and we're working incredibly hard
to ensure..."

06:16.840 --> 06:21.280
Why don't you write the lines,
and we'll say them for you?

06:21.880 --> 06:23.520
It's supposed to be natural.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.000
I was being natural.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.520
We know that the Yrr are
somehow altering the morphology

06:36.680 --> 06:38.520
and behavior of the species they enter.

06:39.320 --> 06:42.080
We think it must be something
to do with the nervous system.

06:42.680 --> 06:46.320
First thing we need to do is
run an analysis of the nervous tissue

06:46.560 --> 06:49.960
of the mussels, the whale, the lobsters
and crabs infected by the Yrr.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.880
And if you're right,
that the Yrr are altering

06:53.040 --> 06:55.640
the species they enter
to make them attack?

06:57.320 --> 06:59.560
Then we figure out a way
to reverse the process.

07:03.320 --> 07:07.040
I did my underwater vehicle training
two years ago, on an old rescue sub.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.040
Fundamentals are the same, this one
just has a few more bells and whistles,

07:11.800 --> 07:13.640
courtesy of Mifune Enterprises.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.320
-So why you?
-Why me what?

07:18.920 --> 07:20.920
Why do you get to make the movie?

07:21.320 --> 07:22.800
I volunteered.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.720
So you know,
I look better from the left.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.880
I'll keep that in mind.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.600
Can we get back to this?

07:46.040 --> 07:47.880
See if there's any leftovers
in the galley.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.080
Sure, I'll head down below.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.560
-I'll take a look.
-Thanks.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.360
What's that?

08:07.880 --> 08:10.040
Engineering, what's with the PS?

08:10.920 --> 08:14.520
Generator output shows okay.
Supplies all look fine.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.040
Is Riku coming?

09:45.480 --> 09:47.760
He's a little under the weather.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.960
CÃ©cile's given him
something to calm his stomach.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.840
You get used to the rolling sensation.
Takes time though.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.600
-You're okay?
-Me?

10:00.720 --> 10:03.120
I'm fine. Iron stomach.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.640
When I was in high school,
I worked in a Japanese theme park.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.880
The money was not great,
but the rides were free.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.720
And I learned
if I wanted to have any fun,

10:14.880 --> 10:16.880
I'd have to get over
the motion sickness.

10:18.440 --> 10:22.080
I also learned to get over
the terrible theme-park food.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.120
To be honest,
when I first saw your ICPO presentation,

10:31.280 --> 10:33.280
I thought you were all mad.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.760
An intelligent life force,
living in the ocean all this time?

10:38.120 --> 10:39.840
So why'd you come?

10:40.440 --> 10:41.920
Mr. Mifune.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.600
He convinced me.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.640
And I've learned
not to doubt his instincts.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.040
-How long have you worked for him?
-Fourteen years.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.840
I heard a talk he gave at my university

10:53.000 --> 10:55.400
about how renewables
would power the world of tomorrow.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.360
His companies were already pivoting,

10:57.520 --> 11:01.080
well ahead of the other energy giants,
well ahead of everyone.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.840
I introduced myself to him and I said,
"When I graduate, I'll work for you."

11:05.360 --> 11:07.000
That I wanted to be at the forefront,

11:07.160 --> 11:09.360
not the rearguard,
of any profession I chose.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.800
So if it turns out he's right,
that you are right...

11:14.040 --> 11:15.080
I want to be here for it.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.480
I think we need
a better name for the Yrr.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.960
If we find them, and tell the world
what we've discovered,

11:27.200 --> 11:29.280
it's got to be something
people can remember.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.920
Something they can pronounce.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.560
I think we've got
more important things to worry about.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.680
The world's just changed.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.840
Tell me,
what's more important than that?

12:00.920 --> 12:02.840
Now that we've isolated
the cross-section

12:03.000 --> 12:04.760
of the messages we picked up,

12:04.920 --> 12:09.040
the next step is to broadcast
those messages back to the Yrr.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Then we add a spike of our own:

12:16.920 --> 12:19.040
the cry of a human baby.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.880
A small but distinct
change in the signal,

12:24.040 --> 12:26.680
so they know we're not just
playing their signal back.

12:32.120 --> 12:38.120
Now, if we get anything back,
and it includes our spike,

12:39.880 --> 12:41.880
we'll know that they heard us.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.440
-You see the area which is glowing?
-Yes.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.400
It indicates
an abnormally high level of glutamate,

12:50.560 --> 12:55.360
which suggests the Yrr are going after
the NMDA receptors on the nerve cells.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.520
-NMDA?
-N-methyl-D-aspartate.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.640
NMDA receptors regulate behavior.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.480
Think of them as satellite dishes
which communicate with every corner

13:05.720 --> 13:08.360
of the nervous system,
informing the body on how to react.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.040
Excuse me.

13:11.320 --> 13:16.160
Glutamate.
That's an NMDA receptor stimulant.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.320
Which, if we're right,
the Yrr are somehow

13:19.560 --> 13:22.440
injecting into the species
to take control of them,

13:22.680 --> 13:26.480
like a puppeteer
pulling the strings of its puppets.

13:28.040 --> 13:32.000
Or an army, marching to its orders.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.440
-I heard you're going out on a dive.
-While Sam is running her comms test.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.760
Captain wants to make sure
this thing actually floats.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.400
-Is that fresh?
-I just made it.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.600
We need to make sure
it can dive to the depth

14:00.760 --> 14:02.560
where you think
this thing might be living.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.480
Is anyone going with you?

14:09.240 --> 14:11.040
At the moment, I'm going alone.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.160
-Didn't you say you just made this?
-Yes.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.760
-I didn't say it was good.
-Aren't you a scientist?

14:19.920 --> 14:23.400
-You measure things...
-That's chemistry. I'm a biologist.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.160
There are a lot of people on board
who can make coffee.

14:27.320 --> 14:31.880
Last I checked, I was the only other
person here with any training in an HOV.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.280
You told me
you trained on a busted-up rescue sub.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.680
Well...

14:36.840 --> 14:40.040
All the more reason to come with you.
I can learn something new.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.040
Okay.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.640
But when we get back...

14:54.720 --> 14:56.000
I'll...

14:56.160 --> 14:59.040
-You can teach me how to make coffee.
-Yes.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.200
Dead slow ahead, Mr. Kofi,
then stop engines.

15:35.720 --> 15:39.200
Comms, start broadcast.
I repeat, start broadcast.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.400
Here we go.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.800
-Ready?
-Ready.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.000
All systems go, ready for descent.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.400
Watch your head.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.960
Requesting connection, HOV to bridge.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.720
-Roger that.
-All set.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.320
Go with engine one, two, three, five.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.040
Eighty percent.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.920
Releasing into the pool.

17:08.880 --> 17:12.000
-Venting air from tank.
-Opening lower doors.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.640
-Mind if I watch?
-Fine with me.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.120
-Captain?
-Watch, yes. Film, no.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.160
You're going to have to
talk to me sometime.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.880
-Later.
-When?

17:32.120 --> 17:33.520
Later.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.160
Leveling off at fifteen hundred meters.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.400
What's that?

18:43.120 --> 18:44.600
I have no idea.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.400
-Can you see anything?
-No.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.280
-Comms?
-We've picked up something on the sonar.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.240
-A mass of some kind.
-We'll take a look.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.200
We got something.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.080
The others should hear this.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.320
Bridge,
our CO2 scrubber fans have failed.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.840
We're running out of fresh air.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.520
Switching to backup.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.560
Bridge, do you copy?

20:37.280 --> 20:39.120
Bridge, do you copy that?

20:41.280 --> 20:43.160
Luther, do you see anything?

20:44.040 --> 20:45.160
Anything?

20:47.200 --> 20:50.120
-Luther, do you copy?
-What's going on?

20:50.360 --> 20:53.000
Sam and Leon picked up a signal
coming in at the same time

20:53.160 --> 20:55.120
we picked up something on the sonar.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.080
They have any idea what it is?

20:57.320 --> 20:59.680
No, but whatever it is,
it's getting closer.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.160
-We need to abort.
-Not yet.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.600
I think there's something out there.
Kill the lights.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.960
HOV, do you have a visual?

21:31.440 --> 21:33.760
-Do you copy?
-Jasper.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.360
Call them back.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.800
Now.

21:38.520 --> 21:40.120
Luther, return to ship.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.640
I repeat, return to ship.

21:53.240 --> 21:54.320
Luther.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.240
-Luther, do you copy?
-Captain, we've lost contact.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.600
Tell Sam and Leon to stop broadcasting.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.920
Comms, cease broadcast.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.280
I repeat, cease broadcast.

22:09.520 --> 22:10.680
We cut the broadcast,

22:10.920 --> 22:12.680
but the signal's still coming in.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.600
Sorry, fuck this.
We're getting out of here.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.240
...on final approach.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.480
Okay, copy that.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.000
-Open the lower doors.
-Open lower doors.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.760
-HOV coming back on board.
-Close the lower doors.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.600
Closing lower doors.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.000
HOV is back on board.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.560
Is the signal you received
the same as you sent out?

24:08.720 --> 24:12.760
It's been modulated and compressed,
but yes, it's the same.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.480
Except for the baby's cry.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.920
-Which has been changed.
-Why?

24:23.960 --> 24:27.160
To show us that whoever,
or whatever, sent the message

24:27.400 --> 24:31.480
understands what we did,
and is replying in kind.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.880
-We have contact?
-We do.

25:06.560 --> 25:10.680
-Thank you, Sara.
-What are you working on?

25:10.840 --> 25:12.880
I was thinking about what you said

25:13.040 --> 25:16.000
about an army
marching to the orders of the Yrr.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.640
If we are right
that the Yrr are using glutamate

25:20.800 --> 25:23.560
to stimulate the nervous system
of the animals they take over,

25:23.720 --> 25:27.680
I was wondering if we can find something
to depress it, you know?

25:40.440 --> 25:44.320
-Are these your children?
-Yes. That was last summer.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.680
-They're beautiful.
-Thank you.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.440
Do you have children?

25:54.160 --> 25:55.280
No.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.400
I... I've thought about it.

26:01.680 --> 26:02.720
But to be honest,

26:04.080 --> 26:05.960
even if we survive this,

26:06.200 --> 26:09.960
I think I'd really need to consider
whether I'd want to bring a child...

26:11.000 --> 26:13.920
into whatever kind of world
this will be.

26:14.640 --> 26:19.560
I couldn't imagine myself as a mother.
It was my ex-husband that wanted them.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.840
But then, they come along,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.880
and you can't believe
how much you love them.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.760
I remember, when Isabelle was little,

26:30.400 --> 26:34.040
standing underneath the climbing frame
as she went higher and higher,

26:34.720 --> 26:38.080
terrified she'd fall,
getting ready to catch her.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.800
What nobody tells you,

26:42.800 --> 26:45.160
what no one even thinks to mention,

26:46.040 --> 26:47.520
is the fear.

26:49.280 --> 26:53.560
You're afraid for them in a way
that you could never be for yourself.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.560
And that you would do anything
to protect them.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.480
We heard from the captain
right before we lost communication.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.560
You didn't see anything?

27:07.720 --> 27:10.000
-Charlie said she did.
-Did she say what it was?

27:10.240 --> 27:12.480
Just that there was something out there.

27:13.080 --> 27:16.800
This far north, the water,
the ice, plays tricks with the light.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.600
-You want my opinion?
-Depends.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.640
If you want to see something,
you see something.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.200
Particularly if you have imagination.

27:25.440 --> 27:29.120
Like Charlie, the lot of you,
must have in spades,

27:29.280 --> 27:31.720
to dream up something like the Yrr.

27:35.560 --> 27:38.880
-So why did you come along?
-To see if you were right.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.880
Does this mean
I'm good for the rest of the trip?

27:43.040 --> 27:44.880
I promise nothing.

27:50.760 --> 27:56.280
Each line represents the wavelengths
of the messages we received.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.320
Now, I can stretch

28:01.240 --> 28:03.320
or shrink each line

28:05.440 --> 28:10.880
to create an image which I can send out
once the captain gives us the go-ahead.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.360
And I'm betting
the Yrr will be able to understand.

29:11.520 --> 29:12.800
Captain?

29:29.280 --> 29:30.760
Put her on the table.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.080
What is this?

29:46.040 --> 29:47.800
Cerebrospinal fluid.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.280
It means there could be a tear or hole

29:50.440 --> 29:52.960
in the membranes
surrounding the brain or spinal cord.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.160
She must have fallen, hit her head.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.960
We need to slow her heart rate,

29:57.120 --> 29:59.720
reduce her blood pressure,
stop any cranial swelling.

29:59.880 --> 30:04.080
In the cabinet there are some sedatives:
Pentobarbital, Thiopental.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.760
Can you get me some ice
and cooling blankets?

30:07.680 --> 30:09.800
Can you prepare a drip
while I administer?

30:09.960 --> 30:10.960
Yes.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.240
Okay.

30:28.640 --> 30:32.560
When the power surged,
there was a blast of sound.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.960
Low-frequency,
below the lower limit of audibility,

30:36.120 --> 30:38.200
so you wouldn't have heard it.

30:38.360 --> 30:42.000
Was it the same as the blast of sound
that came in before?

30:42.640 --> 30:46.160
-Yes, but it was much stronger.
-And do we know what produced it?

30:46.320 --> 30:51.520
No, but I'm pretty sure
it emanated from inside the ship.

30:53.880 --> 30:57.040
-Inside the ship?
-This time, yes.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.760
Can you send what you have on it?

31:03.920 --> 31:06.920
So we'll run a check
and see if we can locate the source.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.640
-Now.
-Sure.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.680
How's Alicia?

31:18.720 --> 31:22.400
-She is stable.
-Is she going to pull through?

31:23.200 --> 31:25.840
It's just too early to tell.

31:42.880 --> 31:47.080
I need to know if anything we're doing
could be producing an acoustic signal.

31:47.240 --> 31:51.040
-Nothing from Engineering.
-Picked up anything?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.480
Nothing, Captain.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.160
-No gear faults?
-No faults, Captain.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.920
-Are the ballast tanks trimmed?
-They are.

32:38.280 --> 32:42.160
-What's that on her arm?
-I don't know, it just appeared.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.760
On her arms, legs.

32:43.920 --> 32:48.200
I thought they might be blood clots, but
there is no discoloration of the skin.

32:48.440 --> 32:52.080
It could be a sign of some internal
trauma to her nervous system.

32:52.240 --> 32:56.200
Trauma to the nervous system
doesn't manifest in that way, does it?

32:56.760 --> 32:59.880
It doesn't. But I don't think
we can rule anything out.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.680
I think we should do a lumbar puncture

33:03.920 --> 33:06.200
so we can examine
the fluid in her spinal column.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.320
You can do that on board?

33:11.080 --> 33:13.360
It's pretty straight-forward.

33:24.160 --> 33:28.200
But I need you to hold her steady
during the procedure.

33:28.360 --> 33:29.840
Fine with me.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.400
Sure.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.800
Okay.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.240
Okay.

34:39.680 --> 34:40.880
It's okay.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.360
Done.

35:10.200 --> 35:14.240
-I never thought I'd get to see this.
-The Arctic?

35:14.480 --> 35:17.960
The Arctic, or anywhere
a hundred miles away from home.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.320
I dreamt about it.

35:23.400 --> 35:28.880
Imagined myself on a ship like this,
looking at an ocean I had never seen.

35:30.560 --> 35:33.800
Being afraid, someone getting hurt...

35:35.640 --> 35:37.320
wasn't part of the dream.

35:40.800 --> 35:44.480
I spent a lot of time
on research vessels when I was a child.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.480
With my parents.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.280
Where?

35:49.640 --> 35:51.600
Mostly south of the Equator.

35:52.480 --> 35:55.640
New Zealand, Mauritius, Cape Verde.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.360
This your first trip this far north?

36:00.560 --> 36:01.760
This far north, yes.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.120
In the Arctic, no.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.200
They woke me up one night.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.560
A storm.

36:16.720 --> 36:20.440
My... My mother told me
everything was going to be okay.

36:21.960 --> 36:26.000
Put me on a lifeboat with some others,
told me to wait for them there, but...

36:29.600 --> 36:31.200
They never came.

36:36.560 --> 36:40.520
Everybody thinks
I should hate the ocean,

36:41.240 --> 36:43.480
be afraid to go anywhere near it.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.200
But it makes me feel closer to them.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.120
Makes me feel like they're there,

36:51.560 --> 36:53.040
keeping me safe.

37:10.240 --> 37:13.160
The slide on the right
is an image of Alicia's nerve cells,

37:13.400 --> 37:15.000
taken from her spinal fluid.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.680
The cells are normal. Healthy.

37:17.840 --> 37:22.120
The nerve cells on the left are from the
same sample, and are badly damaged.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.320
Do you know what caused it?

37:25.240 --> 37:26.920
You see the white threads?

37:27.080 --> 37:30.800
It's the same substance we found
inside the animals infected by the Yrr.

37:31.640 --> 37:34.600
We think the substance
tried to fuse with some of her cells,

37:34.760 --> 37:36.920
the same way it did with them.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.560
The Yrr is inside of her?

37:38.720 --> 37:40.960
The Yrr, or the substance it produces

37:41.120 --> 37:44.040
to take over the nervous system
of the species it enters.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.720
Which means she must have
come into contact with them.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.560
It does, yes.

37:48.720 --> 37:52.200
When we were coming back in the HOV,
I thought I saw something.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.320
-What did you see?
-I don't know.

37:54.560 --> 37:58.160
But whatever it was that was out there,
I think it followed us back inside.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.680
If it did,
it could still be on the ship.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.280
We need to secure the hangar.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.400
We need to run some tests,

38:07.560 --> 38:10.000
make sure we don't put
anyone else's life in danger

38:10.160 --> 38:12.760
until we can figure out
what this thing is.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.560
Everybody on board
signed on for this mission

39:14.720 --> 39:16.760
knowing they might not return.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.200
Yeah.

39:21.640 --> 39:25.720
When I was in the Navy, every sailor
had his list of superstitions.

39:25.880 --> 39:28.440
Always step onto the boat
with your right foot.

39:28.600 --> 39:32.000
Never start a voyage on a Friday,
or change a boat's name.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.880
Never say goodbye when departing.

39:39.680 --> 39:43.800
You know, we all think
we can see the world clearly as it is.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.320
But we don't.

39:46.480 --> 39:50.240
We see the world as we need to see it
to make our lives livable.

39:52.320 --> 39:56.200
Never say goodbye,
and there will be no goodbye.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.680
That's what gets us through.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.120
How is she?

40:07.360 --> 40:09.560
She is in stable condition.

40:09.720 --> 40:13.600
However, treatment here on board
has its limitations.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.200
Does she have a family?

40:15.800 --> 40:18.240
Her mother is listed as her next of kin.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.280
If we can get her
to a hospital in Ravenna...

40:21.520 --> 40:24.560
Crabs are coming ashore
all over the Adriatic region.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.560
Ravenna is also affected.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.760
We will tell her mother
there has been an accident,

40:36.920 --> 40:39.320
but her daughter
is receiving medical care

40:39.560 --> 40:42.280
and will return to Italy as soon
as it is safe for her to travel.

40:43.360 --> 40:45.720
We will allow this one exception.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.200
The communication black-out
remains in effect.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.160
When we broadcast messages
out into space,

41:06.320 --> 41:08.200
we include images of ourselves.

41:11.440 --> 41:15.720
So I thought, why not
send out something about us and the Yrr.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.760
How the sea gave birth to us both.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.640
Evolution.

41:23.800 --> 41:26.840
As I prefer to call it: A common past.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.160
Okay, let's do it.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.440
Sure.

43:13.160 --> 43:14.760
Need a break?

43:14.920 --> 43:17.200
-Couldn't sleep?
-No.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.240
Here.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.320
Let me know if you hear anything.

43:23.760 --> 43:24.760
Yeah.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.040
I'll be right outside.

44:16.760 --> 44:17.960
Sam.
