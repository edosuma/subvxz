The Land Before Time XIV

00:38.680 --> 00:42.800
Journey of the Brave (2016)

00:42.920 --> 00:46.920
NARRATOR: <i>Long, long ago,</i>
<i>in the Land Before Time,</i>

00:47.880 --> 00:50.520
<i>great beasts ruled the world.</i>

00:52.640 --> 00:55.240
<i>These mighty beasts</i>
<i>were the dinosaurs.</i>

00:58.720 --> 01:02.200
<i>Yes, it was a place of wonder,</i>

01:03.680 --> 01:05.519
<i>but also filled with danger...</i>

01:05.600 --> 01:07.480
(ROARS)

01:07.680 --> 01:09.480
<i>...where survival was uncertain</i>

01:10.360 --> 01:13.040
<i>and families were sometimes</i>
<i>torn apart.</i>

01:19.280 --> 01:20.240
(CROAKS)

01:22.080 --> 01:25.720
<i>Which is how the young</i>
<i>Longneck named Littlefoot</i>

01:26.720 --> 01:30.720
<i>came to live with his grandmother,</i>
<i>grandfather,</i>

01:31.360 --> 01:33.680
<i>and his close friends</i>

01:33.760 --> 01:36.720
<i>in the beautiful Great Valley.</i>

01:43.960 --> 01:49.560
<i>The perils of the world had</i>
<i>claimed his mother and</i>
<i>separated him from his father.</i>

01:51.680 --> 01:55.040
<i>Then, a miraculous day came.</i>

01:55.560 --> 01:59.360
<i>Littlefoot and his father,</i>
<i>Bron, were reunited.</i>

02:01.640 --> 02:03.840
<i>During the time they were apart,</i>

02:03.920 --> 02:08.039
<i>Bron had become</i>
<i>the leader of a large migrating herd.</i>

02:08.759 --> 02:12.240
<i>This meant he couldn't stay</i>
<i>with Littlefoot in the Great Valley.</i>

02:14.600 --> 02:16.480
<i>Bron wanted his son to join him,</i>

02:17.400 --> 02:19.640
<i>and Littlefoot wanted</i>
<i>to be with his father,</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:22.320
<i>but he also didn't want</i>
<i>to leave his home.</i>

02:26.680 --> 02:30.840
<i>So Littlefoot made the tough decision</i>
<i>to stay with his grandfather,</i>

02:30.920 --> 02:33.080
<i>grandmother and friends.</i>

02:37.560 --> 02:39.480
<i>Now each year,</i>

02:39.560 --> 02:42.960
<i>when the Season of New Growth</i>
<i>follows the Cold Time,</i>

02:43.040 --> 02:46.240
<i>and the warm sunshine</i>
<i>falls softly on the Great Valley,</i>

02:48.120 --> 02:51.120
<i>Littlefoot looks forward</i>
<i>to a visit from his father,</i>

02:51.400 --> 02:55.240
<i>leading the great herd</i>
<i>on their yearly migration.</i>

02:58.760 --> 03:02.360
<i>It's a reunion he dreams</i>
<i>about all year long.</i>

03:09.680 --> 03:12.160
<i>And it will be happening today.</i>

03:14.280 --> 03:15.240
(GASPS)

03:16.440 --> 03:18.120
Today's the day!

03:23.040 --> 03:24.560

You can't find me!

(ROARING)

03:43.240 --> 03:44.480
(GIGGLES)

03:45.760 --> 03:48.600
Come on, Littlefoot,
we're playing hide
from the Sharptooth!

03:48.680 --> 03:49.760
Come and play!

03:50.400 --> 03:53.200
Can't, Ruby!
My dad's coming today!

03:56.320 --> 03:58.160
Mr. Threehorn,
is Cera around?

03:58.240 --> 04:00.080
She's gone
to the swimming hole.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.640
What's the hurry?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.920
Today's the day
my dad comes back!

04:16.279 --> 04:19.399
(SINGING) <i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Today's the day</i>

04:19.519 --> 04:23.000
<i>My dad's coming home</i>
<i>from far away</i>

04:23.040 --> 04:26.880
<i>We'll race and we'll run</i>
<i>and we'll laugh and play</i>

04:26.960 --> 04:29.600
<i>I feel so happy that I gotta say</i>

04:30.720 --> 04:34.040
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Today is the day</i>

04:40.680 --> 04:44.080
<i>Yep, yep, yep</i>
<i>The time is near</i>

04:44.160 --> 04:47.240
<i>Our brothers and sisters</i>
<i>will soon be here</i>

04:47.320 --> 04:51.000
<i>I will teach them to swim</i>
<i>and to be your friend</i>

04:51.400 --> 04:52.360
(GASPS)

04:52.440 --> 04:55.200
You will teach them
to stay away from your rear end.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.400
Yeah.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.520
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Today is the day</i>

04:59.600 --> 05:01.200
PETRIE: Hey, guys!

05:02.080 --> 05:04.080
<i>It spring! It spring</i>

05:04.160 --> 05:07.800
<i>And me feel like flying</i>

05:09.880 --> 05:13.280
<i>In spring no one be</i>
<i>grumpy or grouch</i>

<i>When me up in the air and skying</i>

05:22.200 --> 05:25.040
Oh! Hey! Oh! Wait! Ohh!

05:25.880 --> 05:27.280
Whoa!

05:27.440 --> 05:28.680
(SPLASHES)

05:30.400 --> 05:31.560
Ouch.

05:32.160 --> 05:35.120
You just barely missed
the hatchlings, Petrie!

05:35.200 --> 05:37.720
Oh, Petrie real sorry.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.600
They're not born yet,
they can't hear you.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.640
No listen to her.

05:45.840 --> 05:46.920
Ahh!

05:49.880 --> 05:51.160
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

05:51.240 --> 05:53.880
Hey, guys,
you know what day
today is?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.200
I do!

05:57.040 --> 05:59.800
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Today's the day</i>

06:00.040 --> 06:03.360
<i>When I'm gonna</i>
<i>blow that rock away</i>

06:03.520 --> 06:07.000
<i>I'll hit it so hard</i>
<i>it'll break in two</i>

06:07.520 --> 06:10.600
<i>You'll be amazed</i>
<i>at what I can do</i>

06:11.240 --> 06:12.920
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

06:13.280 --> 06:14.960
Okay. Get ready!

06:16.360 --> 06:17.720
(GRUNTS)
(THUDS)

06:22.320 --> 06:23.480
What did I tell you?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.440
<i>I moved the rock</i>

06:25.680 --> 06:27.200
<i>We are very, very glad</i>

06:27.400 --> 06:28.880
<i>Me fly so high</i>

06:51.280 --> 06:52.600
(CRACKING)
(GASPING)

06:52.680 --> 06:54.120
The eggs.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.600
(CRACKING)

06:59.600 --> 07:01.000
Ohh!

07:01.840 --> 07:03.480
(CHIRPING)

07:03.760 --> 07:05.880
(CHUCKLES)
Hello, little guy.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.320
Hey.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.760
(LAUGHING)
He got you, Petrie!

07:11.040 --> 07:12.440
He sure do.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.760
(ALL LAUGH)

07:15.880 --> 07:17.360
(CHIRPING)

07:19.760 --> 07:21.200
So cute.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.480
I am Ducky,
your sister.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.200
(CHIRPING)

07:25.880 --> 07:28.360
And this is Spike,
your adopteded brother.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.800
(MOANS PLEASANTLY)

07:33.160 --> 07:36.440
And me Petrie,
your adopteded brother's...

07:36.480 --> 07:38.280
Uh...

07:38.360 --> 07:40.280
Me just Petrie.
(LAUGHS)

07:40.400 --> 07:41.360

07:54.440 --> 07:55.680
(CHIRPING)

07:57.920 --> 08:00.240
(LOUD FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

08:05.280 --> 08:07.120
Grandpa! Grandma!

08:09.080 --> 08:10.520
Look, it's the hatchlings!

08:11.960 --> 08:13.360
(MOANS)

08:14.440 --> 08:17.600
Ah. What a special today
this is.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.520
Today! I forgot.
Today's the day my dad comes back!

08:23.000 --> 08:24.360
Great!
Special day!

08:24.720 --> 08:27.240
We are so happy for you,
yes, we are.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.960
Can we go watch
for him?

08:30.080 --> 08:33.039
(LAUGHS) I thought
you might want to.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.679
Come, Littlefoot.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.360
Now, Grandpa,
keep an eye on the ice.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.040
It's still slippery.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.720
We will, Grandma.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.480
Come on.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.800
We're lucky to live
in such bounty, Littlefoot.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.840
Not many of our kind do.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.480
There they are!
My dad's herd!

09:13.240 --> 09:14.600
You're right, Littlefoot.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.960
But where's my dad?
I don't see him.

09:20.920 --> 09:24.680
That is strange.
Bron is always
at the head of the herd.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.960
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.560
WILD ARMS: Help!

09:29.640 --> 09:31.520
Help!

09:32.640 --> 09:34.360
Help!

09:34.520 --> 09:35.640
Who's that?

09:35.680 --> 09:37.200
We'd better
take a look.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.960
(SCREAMING)

09:46.040 --> 09:47.800
Help!
Oh, I'm safe.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.440
Am I really here?

09:49.520 --> 09:51.000
Somebody pinch me,
please.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.720
No! Not you!
No. Not you. (LAUGHS)

09:55.800 --> 09:57.200
I'll pinch myself.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.160
Ow! Ouch.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.480
Why did I do that?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.240
And you are?

10:03.840 --> 10:06.800
I, uh... Well, everybody
calls me Wild Arms,

10:06.880 --> 10:08.960
though I never really figured out why.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.560
Oh. (LAUGHS)
That makes so much sense now!

10:15.720 --> 10:17.080
What happened, Wild Arms?

10:17.400 --> 10:19.280
Aw, I mean what didn't happen?

10:19.360 --> 10:21.480
The earth shook
and spit liquid fire.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.200
And the heat...
Like you've never seen before!

10:25.320 --> 10:27.360
But, it's too upsetting
to talk about.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.560
But if you must know,
it all started with a horrible boom!

10:33.160 --> 10:34.840
<i>The Fire Mountain exploded.</i>

10:34.880 --> 10:38.480
<i>It just blew its top.</i>
<i>Fire everywhere you looked.</i>

10:39.760 --> 10:41.040
<i>There was no escape.</i>

10:43.880 --> 10:46.680
<i>And the Longnecks, oh,</i>
<i>they were hit the hardest.</i>

10:48.000 --> 10:51.840
<i>Let me tell you,</i>
<i>their leader was brave.</i>

10:53.120 --> 10:54.680
<i>He wouldn't leave</i>
<i>any of us behind,</i>

10:55.200 --> 10:57.000
<i>even though he was in danger.</i>

10:58.120 --> 11:02.000
<i>I only escaped thanks</i>
<i>to my superior grace and agility.</i>

11:05.080 --> 11:06.840
The leader is my dad.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.280
Who?

11:08.480 --> 11:09.600
Bron.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.480
Oh, yes, yes, that's him!

11:12.560 --> 11:13.920
Bron!

11:14.360 --> 11:16.080
What a brave Longneck he was.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.080
Ooh.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.360
Er... Is.
Uh, is!

11:20.440 --> 11:23.240
'Cause he's still is...
He still is... I'm sure.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.080
What happened to him?

11:25.680 --> 11:28.440
I don't know. I lost sight of him
at the Fire Mountain.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.120
He's in trouble?

11:30.200 --> 11:32.720
Grandpa, we have to help him.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.480
Littlefoot...

11:35.240 --> 11:37.200
Will you take us back there?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.520
You know the way.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.760
So, you want me to take you

11:42.880 --> 11:43.960
across the earthbreak,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.440
through the Land of the
Feather-Head Sharptooth,

11:46.560 --> 11:48.040
along the moving water

11:48.120 --> 11:51.440
back to the same Fire Mountain
that I just escaped from?

11:52.320 --> 11:55.120
How foolish do you think I look?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.960
Let me put it another way.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.240
The answer is no!

12:05.080 --> 12:08.880
Please. That's my dad.
He needs our help.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.360
He's right, Littlefoot.
We can't do it.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.240
But...

12:14.360 --> 12:16.160
You'll go, won't you?

12:23.920 --> 12:27.800
I'm sorry, Littlefoot.
It's too dangerous now.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.920
We must wait for the mountain
to stop spitting rocks.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.360
Bron wouldn't want us to get hurt.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.840
But my dad needs us now!

12:37.440 --> 12:40.880
Your father is very strong and wise.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.080
He's lived through
many earthshakes.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.640
I'm sure he's on his way
here right now.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.720
Where are you, Dad?

13:09.400 --> 13:10.920
CERA: There you are.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.240
We couldn't
find you anywhere.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.240
We all worry about you.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.680
We are sorry
about your father.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.120
Yes, we are.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.360
Yes, we sorry.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.280
Thanks.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.960
I think he's in trouble.
He needs me.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.640
What can you do?

13:29.120 --> 13:30.840
I'm going
to the Fire Mountain.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.160
I'm going to help him.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.600
(LAUGHING)
Oh, that funny,

13:36.680 --> 13:39.920
Petrie thought you say
you going to Fire Mountain.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.160
I... I did say that.
I'm going.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.800
No seem funny now.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.040
What are you talking about?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.040
You don't even know
how to get there.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.400
Wild Arms said how.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.800
Across the earthbreak,
through the Land of the
Feather-Head Sharpteeth

13:55.880 --> 13:58.200
and along the moving
water to the Fire Mountain.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.240
If you think
we're going to the
Fire Mountain...

14:02.320 --> 14:05.080
I don't.
He's my father.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.200
