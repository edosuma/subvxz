00:09.290 --> 00:12.070
You sure your mom won't mind
us hanging out at your place?

00:12.100 --> 00:13.240
Oh, not at all.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.240
She has an open door policy.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.260
What's going on?

00:23.530 --> 00:25.130
Whoa!

00:28.500 --> 00:30.400
I got it! I got it.

00:33.270 --> 00:34.410
What?

00:34.440 --> 00:38.110
Wow, you have a bouncy house!

00:38.140 --> 00:40.250
My mom won't even let me jump on the bed.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.280
Whee!

00:44.150 --> 00:45.180
Hey, Mom.

00:45.220 --> 00:47.450
Hi, sweetie!

00:47.490 --> 00:51.190
Mom, you told me you were working
at a birthday party today,

00:51.220 --> 00:53.560
but why is it at our house?

00:53.590 --> 00:57.100
Because I realized I could
charge twice as much this way.

00:57.130 --> 00:58.400
And I'm not "Mom,"

00:58.430 --> 01:00.570
I'm Princess Eczema!

01:03.470 --> 01:06.380
Uh, why are you named after a skin disease?

01:06.410 --> 01:09.110
Because skin diseases all sound magical.

01:09.150 --> 01:10.310
Okay, girls,

01:10.350 --> 01:12.180
time for the pony rides

01:12.220 --> 01:15.320
in the mystical garden of Rosacea!

01:17.390 --> 01:19.120
Ponies?

01:19.160 --> 01:21.490
Please tell me
the mystical garden of Rosacea

01:21.530 --> 01:24.300
is in the backyard, and not my bedroom.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.400
Stop crying.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.440
That tooth was gonna come out anyway.

02:32.540 --> 02:35.180
Oh! Gorgeous!

02:35.210 --> 02:36.410
Thank you.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.250
I have been told that I have
perfect bone structure.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.120
Not your face, the artwork on it.

02:43.150 --> 02:44.250
Can I show this to my mom?

02:44.290 --> 02:46.120
I want this exact bed spread.

02:47.220 --> 02:49.260
Wait a minute.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.420
This, this use of color,

02:51.460 --> 02:53.330
the flowing brush strokes...

02:53.360 --> 02:55.130
Who painted this?

02:55.160 --> 02:56.300
The court Jester.

02:59.600 --> 03:03.140
That's no court Jester, that, that's Zanko!

03:03.170 --> 03:05.270
I think I read something about Zanko once.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.410
"Zanko was considered of his generation

03:07.440 --> 03:10.080
"until he lost fell on hard times,

03:10.120 --> 03:11.220
"and disappeared from the art scene

03:11.250 --> 03:12.480
"to become a birthday
party face-painter,

03:12.520 --> 03:14.250
"citation needed."

03:14.290 --> 03:16.250
Ooh!
Citation found!

03:18.390 --> 03:21.090
Ooh! It's been
I ate my cake. Ince

03:21.130 --> 03:22.390
I can get back in the bouncy house!

03:22.430 --> 03:23.560
Whee!

03:26.100 --> 03:27.430
Zanko was my inspiration.

03:27.470 --> 03:31.240
If it weren't for him, I
probably wouldn't be an artist!

03:31.270 --> 03:32.440
Then what are you waiting for?

03:32.470 --> 03:34.270
Go introduce yourself.

03:34.310 --> 03:37.540
Me? Talk to Zanko?
I'm not worthy.

03:41.150 --> 03:43.450
He's making a hot Fudge
sundae in his pocket.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.320
I think you're worthy.

03:46.420 --> 03:47.560
I'll bring him over.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.460
Uh, Chyna, no!
I can't!

03:49.490 --> 03:52.200
It's okay.
I've gotta get out of here!

04:05.110 --> 04:06.410
Help!

04:06.450 --> 04:08.110
The kingdom of Psoriasis

04:08.150 --> 04:10.180
is collapsing around me!

04:17.260 --> 04:18.490
Surprise!

04:18.529 --> 04:21.190
You knew it was my birthday?

04:22.200 --> 04:25.460
Uh, of course!
Happy Birthday!

04:27.130 --> 04:29.300
Wait, there should be cake.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.470
Where's the cake?

04:32.440 --> 04:35.080
I'll find it.

04:35.110 --> 04:37.540
Actually, Fletcher,
the surprise is for you.

04:37.580 --> 04:39.480
It's time to meet your hero.

04:39.510 --> 04:43.080
Aquaman is here?
In the Ant Farm?

04:43.120 --> 04:44.350
You got Aquaman?

04:44.390 --> 04:46.420
Aquaman is not here.

04:46.450 --> 04:48.420
And why is he your hero?

04:48.460 --> 04:51.190
Unless a crime is committed
underwater, he can't do anything.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.500
Fletcher, meet Zanko.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.370
Zanko?

04:58.400 --> 05:00.400
Uh, these days, most people call me,

05:00.440 --> 05:02.370
"Hey, put your clothes on!

05:02.400 --> 05:04.370
"That fountain's
not for bathing!"

05:06.140 --> 05:08.480
I was just showing Zanko
some of your paintings.

05:08.510 --> 05:13.180
Oh! Yeah, you know,
this is a true work of art.

05:13.220 --> 05:14.480
And if it were hanging in my house,

05:14.520 --> 05:16.420
I would stare at it for hours and hours.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.520
But...I do not
have a house.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.090
Well, offer it to him.

05:25.130 --> 05:27.090
I can't offer him my house.

05:27.130 --> 05:29.530
My parents just
re-did the kitchen.

05:29.570 --> 05:32.270
Not your house, your painting!

05:32.300 --> 05:34.440
Look, he inspired you,

05:34.470 --> 05:37.110
maybe you can inspire him.

05:37.140 --> 05:38.570
Cake?

05:42.510 --> 05:43.510
It would be an honor knowing

05:43.550 --> 05:45.480
that Zanko had one of my paintings.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.250
Zanko?
Hmm?

05:48.280 --> 05:50.220
Would you like to have my...
Socks?

05:50.250 --> 05:51.420
I, uh...

05:53.390 --> 05:55.290
No, painting.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.360
Oh! Um, sure.

05:58.390 --> 06:00.490
That, uh, that would be good, too.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.300
I found the cake!

06:04.330 --> 06:06.370
It's not the greatest cake, but...

06:06.400 --> 06:11.100
It was sweet of you
to wish me a "good year."

06:19.350 --> 06:21.180
Hi, Mrs. Parks.

06:21.220 --> 06:22.420
I'm here about that ad you
posted on the school website

06:22.450 --> 06:24.050
about the princess job opening.

06:24.090 --> 06:25.290
Good.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.460
I really need help entertaining these kids.

06:27.490 --> 06:31.530
They don't seem to like my newest
game, "Sit Down and Be Quiet!"

06:33.230 --> 06:34.400
Well, as you can see,

06:34.430 --> 06:37.200
I'm everything you could
want in a princess.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.370
Pretty, beautiful, and gorgeous!

06:40.400 --> 06:43.270
Well, actually, I do have
one other applicant.

06:44.210 --> 06:46.110
Hi, I'm Paisley!

06:47.580 --> 06:50.150
You know what's totally wild?

06:50.180 --> 06:53.120
I have a friend who looks exactly like you!

06:54.420 --> 06:58.220
Paisley, I'm Lexi.

06:58.260 --> 07:00.560
Oh, my gosh!
Her name is Lexi, too!

07:02.160 --> 07:04.190
Okay, I have an idea.

07:04.230 --> 07:06.100
You two can both work my next party

07:06.130 --> 07:07.300
and I'll see who does a better job.

07:07.330 --> 07:09.400
Fine. But not only
am I gonna gonna win,

07:09.430 --> 07:11.370
I'm gonna crush you.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.400
Wow, that's totally something
my friend Lexi would say!

07:20.080 --> 07:22.380
Olive, what happened to your face?

07:23.310 --> 07:25.150
I washed it.

07:25.180 --> 07:28.150
But it used to be so beautiful.

07:28.180 --> 07:31.190
And now it's...
Ugh, I can't even look at it.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.320
Well, at least my face isn't
black and blue like yours.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.460
Mine's not black and blue.
Not yet.

07:41.430 --> 07:44.430
Guys!
I have exciting news!

07:44.470 --> 07:46.400
And no, it has nothing to do with Aquaman.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.400
Zanko is unveiling a brand new painting

07:50.440 --> 07:52.510
at the Bay View Gallery tonight!

07:52.540 --> 07:55.480
Really? Wow!

07:55.510 --> 07:57.540
Uh, I wonder if there's a
picture on the gallery website.

07:57.580 --> 08:00.450
Oh, man, your artwork
must have inspired him!

08:00.480 --> 08:02.520
This is unbelievable...

08:02.550 --> 08:04.520
I know.
And I hate to mention it,

08:04.550 --> 08:06.220
but none of this would have happened

08:06.250 --> 08:08.190
if I hadn't brought Zanko to you.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.290
Zanko ripped me off.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.260
Yeah, you're welcome...
Wait, what?

08:12.290 --> 08:15.360
He took my painting and is
claiming that it's his.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.130
He signed his name on my work.

08:18.170 --> 08:19.270
Thanks a lot, Chyna.

08:23.270 --> 08:27.210
And just to be clear, I wasn't really thanking you.
I'm actually quite upset.

08:41.539 --> 08:43.470
Thanks for coming to back me up, Olive.

08:43.510 --> 08:45.240
Back you up?

08:45.280 --> 08:46.380
I only came because this place

08:46.410 --> 08:48.580
is next to the city's
best Udon noodle house.

08:48.610 --> 08:50.280
Look, I'm a baby bird.

08:56.390 --> 08:57.560
Oh, there he is!

08:57.590 --> 09:01.030
So, how should we play this?
Good cop, bad cop?

09:01.940 --> 09:03.230
Tall cop, short cop?

09:03.890 --> 09:05.360
Happy cop, sad cop?

09:05.400 --> 09:08.330
Mmm-mmm.
How about...

09:08.370 --> 09:10.300
You go over there and talk to him...
Okay.

09:10.340 --> 09:12.270
While I stay here and eat soup.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.640
All right.
Working cop, lazy cop it is.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.480
It's a beautiful painting.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.180
Thank you.

09:24.220 --> 09:25.320
Too bad you didn't paint it.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.620
Fletcher did.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.490
Zanko doesn't know
what you're talking about.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.560
Don't play games with us!

09:32.590 --> 09:35.290
I should take this bowl of hot soup
and throw it right in your face!

09:37.460 --> 09:39.630
But I can't, it's too good.

09:39.670 --> 09:42.270
Zanko suggests you try their Bibimbap.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.400
They make their own Hoisin sauce.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.170
Really? That sounds good.
But they don't go

09:47.210 --> 09:48.370
too heavy on the sesame oil, do they?

09:48.410 --> 09:52.180
No, no, no, just a splash...
Enough about the soups.

09:52.210 --> 09:54.310
You stole Fletcher's art
and put your name on it.

09:54.350 --> 09:58.290
How dare you accuse Zanko of stealing?

09:58.320 --> 10:00.620
Because Zanko is guilty of stealing.

10:00.660 --> 10:03.520
Chyna was there and Chyna knows the truth.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.330
Why is Chyna talking in the third person?

10:07.500 --> 10:09.460
Olive thinks it sounds cool.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.600
Security, throw them out!

10:11.630 --> 10:13.400
Hey!

10:13.440 --> 10:15.400
Stealing an art piece, that happens,

10:15.440 --> 10:17.640
but you do not mess with a girl's soup!

10:23.680 --> 10:26.550
So, on a scale of one to ten,

10:26.580 --> 10:28.520
how pretty do you think I am?

10:29.650 --> 10:32.290
Ew! What is that thing?

10:32.320 --> 10:34.490
A frog.
Greg brings it everywhere.

10:36.520 --> 10:40.630
If you're a real princess, kiss
it and turn it into a prince.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.660
Kiss it! Kiss it!

10:43.700 --> 10:45.600
Kiss it! Kiss it!

10:45.630 --> 10:47.570
Kiss it! Kiss it!

10:47.600 --> 10:50.570
There's no way I'm kissing
that disgusting ball of slime!

10:50.600 --> 10:52.370
Can I see him?

10:53.740 --> 10:56.680
Aw! Hi, little guy!

10:56.710 --> 10:57.710
Oops!

10:59.310 --> 11:01.450
It jumped out the door!
Come back!

11:06.520 --> 11:08.490
You made a real prince,

11:08.520 --> 11:10.520
and he brought pizza.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.290
You're the best princess ever!

11:16.430 --> 11:17.530
Come on!

11:17.560 --> 11:19.700
What kind of prince drives a moped?

11:26.440 --> 11:28.410
I'm so sorry, Fletcher.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.240
We couldn't get your painting back.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.380
What?

11:31.410 --> 11:33.510
But the gallery opening is tonight.

11:33.550 --> 11:35.650
He's going to sell my painting
and it will be gone forever.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.250
Wait, it gets worse.

11:39.590 --> 11:41.290
He took my soup!

11:43.290 --> 11:45.420
Don't worry, I have an idea.

11:46.430 --> 11:47.660
A way we can get it back.

11:47.690 --> 11:49.530
But wouldn't my soup be cold by now?

11:49.560 --> 11:50.660
Not the soup.

11:53.300 --> 11:56.400
I was thinking we could
steal your painting back.

11:56.440 --> 11:59.310
And I know just the team
of experts for the job.

12:50.390 --> 12:53.390
And great friend.
Polite, funny, stunningly beautiful,

12:53.430 --> 12:54.590
lover of animals, deep sleeper,

12:54.630 --> 12:57.390
knows how to microwave
popcorn to maximum poppage

12:57.430 --> 12:58.700
without burning a single kernel...

12:58.730 --> 13:00.360
Okay, we're done.

13:10.350 --> 13:12.280
Thank you all for coming to see.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.590
Zanko's latest masterpiece, entitled...

13:16.450 --> 13:17.590
"Zanko's Latest Masterpiece!"

13:27.260 --> 13:29.530
Okay, switch places with me.

13:29.570 --> 13:31.470
You wanna be the mermaid?

13:31.500 --> 13:33.370
No. I want to be Aquaman,

13:33.400 --> 13:35.410
but that's the next best thing.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.450
I can't find my mommy!

13:42.480 --> 13:45.280
It's okay, little girl.
Calm down.

13:45.320 --> 13:49.190
Now, tell me what your mommy
looks like and I'll go find her.

13:49.220 --> 13:52.390
I have to warn you, I've never
had much luck finding women.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.360
She has purple hair,

13:56.630 --> 13:58.630
a gold tooth,

13:58.670 --> 14:00.570
and a glass eye.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.440
Okay.

14:06.170 --> 14:09.180
You just wait right here
and I'll go find your mommy.

14:09.210 --> 14:13.350
Please hurry.
I miss her so much!

14:13.380 --> 14:14.450
Come on, come on.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.420
I am digging the little girl voice.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.290
Angus! Come on.
Oh!

14:25.330 --> 14:27.630
Okay, I'm shutting down
the security cameras.

14:29.500 --> 14:33.430
Mr. and Mrs. Angus Chestnut
have tied the knot.

14:33.470 --> 14:35.200
That is not the code we discussed.

14:36.540 --> 14:39.500
Copy. Mr. and Mrs.
Fletcher Quimby are walking down the aisle.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.470
That is not the code we discussed.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.480
No one's looking. Now's our chance
to get over to the air vent.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.280
Okay, okay.

15:00.660 --> 15:03.460
Commence Operation What's That Smell?

15:03.500 --> 15:05.370
"Operation What's That Smell"?

15:05.400 --> 15:09.100
The moldy sandwich we found at
the bottom of Angus' locker?

15:09.140 --> 15:11.370
Did you pay any attention
during the code meeting?

15:22.150 --> 15:23.280
What are you doing?

15:24.550 --> 15:27.290
Uh, taking turns.
It's only fair.

15:30.390 --> 15:33.200
What's that smell?

15:35.170 --> 15:38.200
Okay, for once, it's not me.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.570
Okay, time to intercept Zanko's call.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.340
Maintenance, here.

15:46.580 --> 15:49.280
There is a horrible stench in the gallery,

15:49.310 --> 15:51.580
and Zanko needs it fixed immediately!

15:51.620 --> 15:56.190
I'll, uh, have someone from the Horrible
Stench Department to check it out.

15:58.360 --> 15:59.590
Wow.

15:59.620 --> 16:02.260
I am digging the deep voice, too.

16:08.460 --> 16:12.200
Uh, Apparently, it's pretty bad.

16:12.230 --> 16:13.570
They sent a guy in a hazmat suit,

16:13.600 --> 16:16.440
and a wolf suit.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.540
Okay,

16:20.580 --> 16:23.250
we need to clear the room.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.550
I'm gonna need everybody

16:24.580 --> 16:28.380
to run out of here in a screaming panic.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.490
If I've learned one thing,

16:31.520 --> 16:34.390
it's that people always do
the opposite of what I say.

16:34.430 --> 16:36.260
Ah!
That's why I would never say,

16:36.290 --> 16:39.460
"Please leave in a calm
and orderly fashion."

16:39.500 --> 16:41.360
No! No!

16:46.500 --> 16:48.600
Here's your balloon animal.
It's a...

16:49.470 --> 16:50.540
Earthworm!

16:52.440 --> 16:54.180
I asked for a pony.

16:55.450 --> 16:57.610
Well, you don't always get what you want.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.420
I asked for a real pony when I was six,

17:00.450 --> 17:02.280
and I got one, so...

17:03.350 --> 17:04.450
Bad example.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.560
I can try to make a pony!

17:11.359 --> 17:13.500
Ooh! Wow!

17:15.470 --> 17:17.569
Here you go!

17:17.599 --> 17:20.300
Just watch out for the
balloon pony droppings.

17:26.150 --> 17:27.550
Whoa!

17:33.390 --> 17:34.550
It's not funny!

17:36.390 --> 17:38.420
Don't worry.

17:38.460 --> 17:42.160
Just grab onto the ladder and I'll
pull you into my balloon-copter.

17:46.470 --> 17:48.330
There's the painting.
Come on, let's get it.

17:49.300 --> 17:52.240
Wait! We're in lock down.

17:52.270 --> 17:55.210
There is probably an invisible laser net.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.580
Luckily, I have a dancer's body.

18:14.290 --> 18:15.590
There are no lasers.

18:17.560 --> 18:21.370
Time to disable the locking
mechanism on the glass case.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.570
All I have to do is, bypass the...

18:25.300 --> 18:27.370
Look who I found!

18:29.310 --> 18:30.610
Wow, you're good!

18:31.540 --> 18:33.310
What are you doing?

18:33.340 --> 18:34.440
Um...

18:35.350 --> 18:37.380
I'm Ted, the new guy.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.550
Go ahead and take
the rest of the night off.

18:40.490 --> 18:43.490
Awesome! Thanks, Ted!

18:43.520 --> 18:45.560
<i>Angus, hurry up</i>
<i>and unlock the glass case!</i>

18:46.530 --> 18:49.160
Hey, wait.

18:49.190 --> 18:50.330
I'm Ted, the new guy.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.560
Run!

18:51.600 --> 18:53.260
Something's wrong.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.570
Angus isn't responding.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.500
All right.

18:56.530 --> 18:59.640
I'm going to have to break
the glass with my Taekwon...

19:00.440 --> 19:01.570
Doh!

19:04.380 --> 19:05.540
Wait a second.

19:05.580 --> 19:07.280
Maybe I can break it.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.080
If I hit the right resonance frequency,

19:09.110 --> 19:10.250
I could shatter the glass.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.360
I'm sorry, Wacky.
Let me try another frequency.

19:30.230 --> 19:31.430
Ooh, yes!
Yes!

19:31.470 --> 19:35.440
What do you think you are doing?

19:35.470 --> 19:38.440
Abort the mission!
Ants on the run!

19:38.470 --> 19:41.240
Security?
Grab them!

19:48.280 --> 19:50.150
They can't see us, let's go!

19:55.260 --> 19:56.520
Ow!

19:56.560 --> 20:00.400
This feather is ironically heavy!

20:01.360 --> 20:02.560
Quick, run!

20:10.370 --> 20:11.470
There.

20:11.510 --> 20:14.540
Your masterpiece is back where it belongs.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.340
I just wish we could have stayed

20:16.380 --> 20:18.210
to see the look on Zanko's face

20:18.250 --> 20:21.280
when he noticed the painting was gone.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.620
Oh, he'll never know it's missing.

20:23.650 --> 20:25.490
What do you mean?

20:25.520 --> 20:28.160
Before I ran out,

20:28.190 --> 20:30.520
<i>like all great art thieves,</i> <i>I replaced
the painting</i> <i>with a perfect replica.</i>

20:31.490 --> 20:32.630
Oops.

20:34.660 --> 20:38.330
<i>That way,</i> <i>Zanko will think we
failed,</i> <i>and never come after us.</i>

20:46.510 --> 20:49.610
So you gave Zanko another
one of your paintings?

20:49.650 --> 20:51.580
Nope, forgery.

20:53.350 --> 20:54.550
Done by you.

20:54.580 --> 20:56.450
Which makes it another original.

20:57.450 --> 20:59.490
Oh. I didn't
think of that.

21:02.530 --> 21:04.430
I guess we'll have to reassemble the team.

21:15.370 --> 21:17.310
Okay, we're done.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.350
All right, kids, it's time to vote.

21:23.380 --> 21:25.380
Who likes Princess Paisley best?

21:27.180 --> 21:28.280
Who likes Princess Lexi?

21:32.320 --> 21:34.320
You remind me of my friend.

21:36.260 --> 21:39.200
I don't understand.

21:39.230 --> 21:42.200
I mean, I've been terrible at everything.

21:42.230 --> 21:43.570
Yeah, but that's what makes you funny.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.440
There's nothing funny
about being good at your job.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.170
Congratulations, Lexi.

21:49.210 --> 21:52.210
You will be working
the next birthday party.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.240
Greg's.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.550
He wants a princess at his party?

21:57.580 --> 21:59.210
Not exactly.

22:03.490 --> 22:07.360
This is the Goliath
Bird-eating Spider.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.190
Did you say
"Bird-eating?"

22:10.230 --> 22:12.130
Eat her! Eat her!

22:12.160 --> 22:13.560
Eat her! Eat her!

22:13.600 --> 22:15.460
Eat her! Eat her!

22:15.500 --> 22:19.340
Eat her! Eat her!
Eat her! Eat her!
