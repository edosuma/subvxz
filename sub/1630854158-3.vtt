00:19.595 --> 00:21.562
♪

00:28.678 --> 00:32.756
I am so excited for
the scout jamboree this weekend.

00:32.758 --> 00:35.534
Dad, hand over the family bugle!

00:35.536 --> 00:36.869
Here she is!

00:36.871 --> 00:38.929
Old Blowy.

00:38.931 --> 00:40.113

-(fanfare playing)
-Hmm?

00:43.026 --> 00:45.026
What? You're not a boy!

00:45.028 --> 00:46.937
You can't join
the Boy Explorers!

00:46.939 --> 00:48.863
And that's a flugelhorn!

00:48.865 --> 00:51.032
Yes. It's the hardest horn.

00:51.034 --> 00:53.034
And, FYI, I did join.

00:53.036 --> 00:55.612
And I already have
three badges--

00:55.614 --> 00:56.889
environmentalism,

00:56.891 --> 00:57.964
badge-receiving,

00:57.966 --> 00:59.892
and sibling rivalry.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.560
Come on, you two...

<i> MALE HACKER (distorted):</i>
<i>Attention, corporate overlords,</i>

01:03.972 --> 01:06.381
<i> we are Pseudo-nonymous,</i>

01:06.383 --> 01:09.459
<i> and we have taken over</i>

01:09.461 --> 01:12.629
We are the anarchist collective
of nameless hacktivists

01:12.631 --> 01:15.632
who published the internal
emails of Waffle House

01:15.634 --> 01:19.244
and brought Home Depot's
"Find a store near you" feature

01:19.246 --> 01:21.138
to its knees.

01:21.140 --> 01:25.233
FEMALE HACKER:
Now we have hacked into
the Disney Corporation's servers

01:25.235 --> 01:29.254
and seized hundreds of hours
of never-before-aired footage

01:29.256 --> 01:32.257
from the television show
<i> The Simpsons.</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:34.742
Stories so ill-conceived,

01:34.744 --> 01:36.244
so idiotic

01:36.246 --> 01:38.322
that their exposure
would destroy

01:38.324 --> 01:41.433
the value
of the very I.P. itself.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.604
Until we are paid a ransom
of $20 million in Bitcoin,

01:45.606 --> 01:48.832
we will air
these show-destroying scenes

01:48.834 --> 01:50.109
one after another,

01:50.111 --> 01:52.236
starting now.

01:54.857 --> 01:57.116
No, no, it can't be true!

01:57.118 --> 01:58.951
It is true, Carl.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.027
There never was a Lenny.

02:01.029 --> 02:04.698
So Lenny was just a figment
of my imagination?

02:04.700 --> 02:06.291
I... I made him up?

02:06.293 --> 02:08.443
Yeah, your psyche
created "Lenny"

02:08.445 --> 02:10.963
to help you deal
with a terrible trauma there.

02:10.965 --> 02:14.633
-What trauma?
-Finding out your previous
best friend wasn't real.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.301
It's kind of a thing with you.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.638
Huh. Hey, I haven't seen you
in here before.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.365
I'm Carl. What's your name?

02:21.367 --> 02:23.124
Nice to meet you, Steven.

02:23.126 --> 02:25.093
Aw, crap, here we go again.

02:26.205 --> 02:28.814
Now you see
we mean business, Disney.

02:28.816 --> 02:32.559
You will submit $20 million
in Bitcoin to our crypto wallet

02:32.561 --> 02:34.711
at the following address.

02:34.713 --> 02:36.062
Until the payment arrives,

02:36.064 --> 02:38.732
we will keep playing
these nonsensical clips

02:38.734 --> 02:41.034
no one was ever meant to see.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.979
What's his name?

02:44.981 --> 02:46.165
Number Eight.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.575
I mean, Santa's Little Helper.

02:48.577 --> 02:50.002

02:50.004 --> 02:53.154
Greetings,
lamewads from the past!

02:53.156 --> 02:56.491
I have come back in time to
reveal the events of the future,

02:56.493 --> 02:59.160
so that you can amaze the world

02:59.162 --> 03:03.256
with your uncannily accurate
predictions!

03:03.258 --> 03:05.350
Less yelling, more foretelling.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.594
My first shocking prediction is,

03:07.596 --> 03:09.079
in 2016,

03:09.081 --> 03:12.632
the Nobel Prize in Economics
will go to...

03:12.634 --> 03:14.601
Bengt R. Holmström!

03:14.603 --> 03:17.103
Why would anyone care
if we predicted that?

03:17.105 --> 03:18.363
I don't know, but they will.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.106
Do you have anything
a little more...

03:20.108 --> 03:22.092
oh, impressive?

03:22.094 --> 03:23.685
Donald Trump
is gonna be president.

03:23.687 --> 03:26.538
(screams) Less impressive!
Less impressive!

03:26.540 --> 03:29.766
Okay, let's see. You're gonna
want to mention gas hoarding,

03:29.768 --> 03:30.876
pandemics,

03:30.878 --> 03:33.954
Germany beats Brazil
in the 2014 World Cup,

03:33.956 --> 03:35.196
Disney buys Fox.

03:35.198 --> 03:37.031
And then they both go under?!

03:37.033 --> 03:39.443
No, they're both absorbed
by Panda Express.

03:39.445 --> 03:42.054
Pretty much everything now
is Panda Express.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.538
-That makes sense.
-I get it.

03:43.540 --> 03:45.557
Ooh! Orange chicken.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.880
Arr.

03:52.882 --> 03:54.958
Yarr.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.401
Aye.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.694
-Yarr!
-Aye!

03:58.888 --> 04:00.480
(gulping)

04:00.482 --> 04:01.573
Yarr?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.033
(chuckles):
Aye.

04:06.396 --> 04:07.988
Yarr!

04:07.990 --> 04:09.331
Aye!

04:12.419 --> 04:13.660
Aye?

04:13.662 --> 04:15.570
Yarr.

04:15.572 --> 04:16.663
Aye?

04:16.665 --> 04:17.673
Yarr!

04:19.260 --> 04:20.259
Aye?

04:20.261 --> 04:21.167
Yarr!

04:21.169 --> 04:23.987
-Aye! Aye!
-Yarr! Yarr!

04:23.989 --> 04:25.222
-Aye!
-Yarr!

04:26.767 --> 04:28.267
Aye!

04:29.011 --> 04:30.160
(sighs):
Aye!

04:30.162 --> 04:31.828
(sighs):
Yarr.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.163
Yarr.

04:34.424 --> 04:38.068
<i> -Yarr, yarr, yarr, yarr...!</i>
<i> -Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye,</i>
<i> aye, aye, aye, aye, aye!</i>

04:42.007 --> 04:44.449
Till the morrow, chums!

04:44.451 --> 04:45.525
(groans)

04:45.527 --> 04:48.120
-(children laughing)
-(humming happily)

04:49.681 --> 04:51.531
(groans)

04:51.533 --> 04:53.366
WOMAN (New York accent):
Is that you, babe?

04:53.368 --> 04:55.685
(New York accent):
Yeah, yeah, I'm home.

04:55.687 --> 04:58.446
-Daddy! Daddy! How was school?
-Hey.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.632
It ain't school for Daddy,
sweetheart.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.858
It's work.

05:01.860 --> 05:05.045
Soul-sucking, grueling work.

05:05.047 --> 05:06.454
Then why don't you quit?

05:06.456 --> 05:09.032
Always with the quitting,
this one.

05:09.034 --> 05:11.493
I can't do that, Doreen!

05:11.495 --> 05:15.981
The police department
needs someone inside the school!

05:15.983 --> 05:17.983
So why's it got to be you?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.059
Look at me, Didi.

05:19.061 --> 05:21.061
I'm the only 36-year-old

05:21.063 --> 05:23.063
who can pass for ten!

05:23.065 --> 05:25.065
How 'bout passing
for a good father?

05:25.067 --> 05:26.566
The kids hardly know you.

05:26.568 --> 05:29.661
You're out every afternoon
till 3:00 p.m.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.721
4:00 if there's chess club.

05:31.723 --> 05:32.998
You think I want to be there?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.649
Martin likes chess!

05:34.651 --> 05:36.168
Not me!

05:37.412 --> 05:41.823
I don't know where Martin ends
and my Reggie begins!

05:41.825 --> 05:43.967
(crying)

05:48.757 --> 05:50.682
Aw, maybe you're right.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.517
Maybe I am in too deep.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.854
It's just, when I was diagnosed
with... this,

05:55.856 --> 05:58.248
I said,
"I'm not gonna let it beat me.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.266
I'm gonna use it for good!"

06:00.268 --> 06:02.861
I'm doing good, aren't I?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.029
You are, Reg.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.923
You're a great role model
for your kids.

06:06.925 --> 06:08.867
All three of 'em.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.760
(gasps)
You mean...?

06:10.762 --> 06:11.853
I do.

06:12.764 --> 06:15.098
(distorted): They still
haven't paid the ransom.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.525
Did they not see
the nonsense we just released?

06:17.527 --> 06:19.603
How is Martin Prince
an adult cop?

06:19.605 --> 06:21.880
(distorted):
Well, maybe I overestimated

06:21.882 --> 06:23.957
how much
Disney cares about Lenny.

06:23.959 --> 06:25.717
No, it's not your fault.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.220
You're the finest
digital terrorist I know.

06:28.222 --> 06:31.965
Your malware shut down the
Portland Airport for two weeks.

06:31.967 --> 06:35.135
(chuckles)
Everyone missed Thanksgiving.

06:35.137 --> 06:37.396
It's sweet you remembered.

06:37.398 --> 06:40.957
Aw, you're sweet, too.
(chuckles)

06:40.959 --> 06:42.734
We should probably get back
to...

06:42.736 --> 06:44.719
(non-distorted):
blackmailing
the major corporation.

06:44.721 --> 06:47.981
Wait! Why did the voice-changing
app switch off?

06:47.983 --> 06:51.392
(non-distorted British voice):
Bollocks. I didn't upgrade
to the premium edition,

06:51.394 --> 06:53.970
and the free trial period
ran out, I'm afraid.

06:53.972 --> 06:55.747
I am so daft.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.398
Oh, my God, you're British?

06:57.400 --> 07:00.994
That must be delightful
for your wife or girlfriend.

07:00.996 --> 07:02.570
Oh, no, I'm painfully single.

07:02.572 --> 07:05.090
Nary a romantic appointment
in my "shed-you-ul."

07:05.092 --> 07:07.000
Say that last part again.

07:07.002 --> 07:09.261
You mean... "shed-you-ul"?

07:09.263 --> 07:12.097
(sultrily):
Shed-you-ul.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.057
MALE HACKER:
Shed-you-ul.

07:17.996 --> 07:19.921
-(moaning)
-(masks clacking)

07:19.923 --> 07:21.331
Oh! We're back on! We're live!

07:21.333 --> 07:23.382
Well, I-I suppose we should
threaten them some more.

07:23.384 --> 07:26.945
How about I just run another
batch of show-ruining clips

07:26.947 --> 07:28.171
so we can...

07:28.173 --> 07:30.097
Topple the capitalist system

07:30.099 --> 07:31.766
and its bought-and-paid-for...

07:31.768 --> 07:34.536
Political enablers.

07:36.698 --> 07:38.031
(speaking French)

07:38.033 --> 07:39.166
(chuckles)

07:41.444 --> 07:43.670
<i> OPERATOR:</i>
<i> Do you speak English?</i>

07:49.194 --> 07:52.220
We're trapped!
Someone get help!

07:57.644 --> 08:00.870
<i> I can't help</i>
<i> if I can't understand you.</i>

08:00.872 --> 08:03.106
Won't anyone do something?!

08:17.998 --> 08:20.665
<i> (groans) Never mind.</i>

08:23.152 --> 08:24.728
Let me get this straight.

08:24.730 --> 08:28.673
You mowed down all that corn
to build a football field,

08:28.675 --> 08:31.843
hoping it would lure
the ghosts of former players

08:31.845 --> 08:33.903
down from football heaven?

08:33.905 --> 08:36.264
Uh-huh. And look!

08:38.167 --> 08:41.186
Hey, I don't recognize
any of these guys.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.930
Why are there two 50-yard lines?

08:43.932 --> 08:45.190
Aw, damn it!

08:45.192 --> 08:47.317
I built a Canadian field!

08:48.253 --> 08:49.753
Oh. Sorry, hoser.

08:49.755 --> 08:50.695
My bad, eh?

08:50.697 --> 08:53.180
Hey, nice rouge there, Gordo.

08:53.182 --> 08:55.182
Hey, Homer!
Throw you a Hail Mary?

08:55.184 --> 08:57.410
Shut up, Flutie.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.766
Uh, yes. (clears throat)
The day is Sol, uh, 150.

09:02.768 --> 09:04.859
I am stranded on Mars.

09:04.861 --> 09:09.030
I suspect my fellow astronauts
left me behind on purpose,

09:09.032 --> 09:10.774
as from the bathroom

09:10.776 --> 09:12.776
I did hear the giggling
and the shushing

09:12.778 --> 09:16.279
and the "Blast off quick
before he's done tinkling."

09:16.281 --> 09:19.799
I have a mere three days
of air and water remaining.

09:19.801 --> 09:22.227
There is no hope.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.229
Unless
I glayvenate the hydrogen,

09:24.231 --> 09:25.730
flavenize the oxygen,

09:25.732 --> 09:28.491
and, yes, yes,
poopulate the soil!

09:28.493 --> 09:31.628
It was a simple matter
of applying pseudoscience

09:31.630 --> 09:35.481
and phantasmagorical engineering
to the problem. Yes.

09:35.483 --> 09:38.392
Oh, yes, I also cloned myself
for company.

09:38.394 --> 09:40.561
And my fellow Frinks
have built us all

09:40.563 --> 09:42.396
an escape rocket.
Isn't that wonderful?

09:42.398 --> 09:45.417
(clones laughing, chattering)

09:45.419 --> 09:46.976
Leaving!

09:46.978 --> 09:48.753
(gasps)

09:48.755 --> 09:51.047
Aw, flayvin me in the glayvin!

09:52.984 --> 09:54.408
Hello. This is Homer Simpson.

09:54.410 --> 09:56.428
From the bottom of my heart,
I apologize

09:56.430 --> 09:59.672
to the great, great,
great people of Finland

09:59.674 --> 10:00.748
for what I said.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.750
I have done many, many,

10:02.752 --> 10:04.844
many, many,<i> many</i> episodes,

10:04.846 --> 10:06.830
and in one of those-- just one--

10:06.832 --> 10:08.589
I mixed you up with Norway.

10:08.591 --> 10:13.094
And I have so, so, so,<i> so,</i>
so much love and respect for...

10:13.096 --> 10:15.004
I think "Finns"
is what you're called.

10:15.006 --> 10:16.764
And if I ever-- I mean ever--

10:16.766 --> 10:18.524
ever, ever,<i> ever</i> thought

10:18.526 --> 10:20.360
that an innocent slip
of the tongue

10:20.362 --> 10:21.953
is something
that an entire nation

10:21.955 --> 10:23.270
could get worked up about,

10:23.272 --> 10:25.515
I would've kept my mouth shut.

10:25.517 --> 10:29.294
And the scary, scary, scary,
oh-so-scary lawyers

10:29.296 --> 10:31.630
of the giant, giant--
I mean giant--

10:31.632 --> 10:35.191
so, so giant,
scary corporation I work for

10:35.193 --> 10:37.802
would not have had to draft
this statement.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.195
God bless you

10:39.197 --> 10:41.973
and all the peoples
of South America,

10:41.975 --> 10:44.701
for you are a-- What?

10:44.703 --> 10:46.961
What do you mean
I have to record it again?

10:46.963 --> 10:48.146
What did I say?

10:54.637 --> 10:57.213
You're chewing too loud.

10:57.215 --> 10:59.899
From now on,
only two chews per bite.

10:59.901 --> 11:02.643
One, two, swallow.
One, two, swallow.

11:02.645 --> 11:07.207
I think I've misplaced
my appetite, mother.

11:09.169 --> 11:13.129
I need to see you right now.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.160
I deserve this.

11:19.162 --> 11:21.388
I deserve to feel like a man.

11:22.498 --> 11:26.184
Only with you
do I truly feel alive.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.687
I made this just for you.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.022
Thank you, Mother.

11:31.024 --> 11:35.585
Anything for my son.
I am so proud of you.

11:35.587 --> 11:38.196
Oh, Mommy.
I can't wait another second.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.864
You know I need it.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.117
(sultry music playing)

11:59.961 --> 12:01.836
I almost forgot
to give you this.

12:01.838 --> 12:03.680
Leave it on the dresser.

12:07.210 --> 12:09.894
If only that were
my real mother.

12:09.896 --> 12:14.274
(groans)
If only that were my real son.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.570
(Homer humming happily)

12:18.572 --> 12:20.572
I don't mean to be
unneighborly, but, uh,

12:20.574 --> 12:23.466
you wouldn't know what happened
to my old nostril skirt?

12:23.468 --> 12:27.320
Mustache you say?
Hmm, let me think.

12:27.322 --> 12:30.749
Stroking this goatee
I've always had.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.417
Stroking, stroking...

12:32.419 --> 12:36.087
That's it.
Boys, we're Jewish now.

12:41.002 --> 12:42.761
Mmm.
(swallows)

12:42.763 --> 12:44.929
From bun to pickle,
a masterpiece.

12:44.931 --> 12:49.434
The exquisite flavor is matched
only by the peerless mouthfeel.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.827
Five stars.

12:50.829 --> 12:53.329
Bravo, Harvey Comics, bravo.

12:53.331 --> 12:55.832
A stunning addition
to the Casper-verse.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.758
No notes. Ten stars.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.261
With this level of
sour cream in your blood,

13:00.263 --> 13:03.189
your brain is completely
starved of oxygen.

13:03.191 --> 13:05.508
Consequently, you're a moron.

13:05.510 --> 13:09.028
A perfect explanation.
Succinct and devastating.

13:09.030 --> 13:10.789
Infinite stars!

13:10.791 --> 13:15.460
Best. Diagnosis. Ev--
(groaning)

13:20.783 --> 13:21.966
Give me a beer, pally.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.968
Hey, I know you, don't I?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.529
Nah, must be thinking
of someone else, slim.

13:26.531 --> 13:29.790
No, I've definitely seen
you around town.

13:29.792 --> 13:30.975
Sign here, chief.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.793
Here's your passport, gorgeous.

13:32.795 --> 13:34.720
Brake pads are shot, tough guy.

13:34.722 --> 13:36.130
Want that toasted, honcho?

13:36.132 --> 13:37.890
Found your car keys, big shot.

13:37.892 --> 13:39.317
Those were all you!

13:39.319 --> 13:41.152
I don't know
what to tell you, slick.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.488
Just got that sort of face.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.660
ALL:
Pally-pally-pally-pally-pally-

13:48.662 --> 13:53.581

-You're more beautiful!

14:02.825 --> 14:04.233
Oh. Oh, dear.

14:04.235 --> 14:07.403
The world has seen
our exquisite symmetrical faces.

14:07.405 --> 14:10.664
Then they've also seen
that we're... in love?

14:10.666 --> 14:11.908
My God. Yes.

14:11.910 --> 14:13.834
Yes, that's what it is,
isn't it?

14:13.836 --> 14:15.595
It is. (stammers)
It is stunning.

15:36.085 --> 15:38.085

No, Clancy,
I swear to you it's not true.

Luann, how could you?!

16:19.887 --> 16:21.554
I'm not hers either.

It was a different time.

16:46.097 --> 16:49.732
Back then, we solved things
with huge lies.
