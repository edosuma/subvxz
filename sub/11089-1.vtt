00:20.600 --> 00:27.760
The Swedish intelligence service has
no agents who are licensed to kill.

00:27.880 --> 00:32.840
It must not happen under any
circumstances.

00:32.960 --> 00:39.560
Except in self-defense
or if it is in the Nation's interest.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.320
You had a bad dream again.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.280
Did I wake you?

01:07.080 --> 01:08.120
No.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.120
Why can't you tell me
where you're going?

01:26.680 --> 01:29.400
Because I won't lie to you.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.400
Don't then ...

01:32.480 --> 01:33.840
tell me the truth.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.520
I'm coming back.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.280
Four months later.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.560
Uzbekistan, on the border
of Afghanistan.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.120
Denisov, Denisov...

03:53.280 --> 03:55.280
I know when someone is bluffing.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.360
It's just what you think.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.960
I see it in your eyes.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.400
As my mom used to say,

04:06.880 --> 04:08.480
"If you trust women,"

04:08.600 --> 04:10.120
"you die poor."

04:10.800 --> 04:12.240
"If you trust men,"

04:13.120 --> 04:14.680
"you die young."

04:15.840 --> 04:18.440
Your mother was a wise woman.

04:23.160 --> 04:27.560
You bastard ...
What a hell of luck you have!

04:28.760 --> 04:32.400
Mr. Green has taught me
everything I know.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.440
Mr. Green, Mr. Dollar.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.280
Mr. Green is a good man.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.640
We're set.
We go tomorrow.

04:40.760 --> 04:45.320
That's good ... This fucking place
is starting to get on my nerves.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.880
Cheers!

06:20.600 --> 06:22.720
Krutov, take out the goods.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.280
Follow me.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.000
How many do you have?

06:51.600 --> 06:54.760
As agreed. 200 pieces.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.960
If you have the correct coordinates,

06:59.080 --> 07:03.720
you can hit an American
in the head 80-kilometers away.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.480
Take them away.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.920
Come on.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.520
Help.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.800
- Denisov, is that your real name?
- Yes.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.720
Yeah? You know what this is?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.560
Face against the truck!

08:41.520 --> 08:43.159
Bandits!

09:44.720 --> 09:46.760
Chaka.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.840
There is one guy who's missing,
the driver Sergei.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.480
So where is my money?

10:02.320 --> 10:04.440
The driver's missing.
Find him!

10:55.160 --> 10:57.480
After him!

11:47.440 --> 11:50.960
English subtitles by pixel

12:03.080 --> 12:07.400
Military Intelligence and
Security...Stockholm.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.720
So an unknown group,

12:11.840 --> 12:15.800
turns out to be Europe's most
wanted weapons smuggling organization.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.720
And 200 Sky Shadow mortars go missing.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.560
Is that what I'm supposed to think?

12:23.400 --> 12:24.720
That's what happened.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.840
Your mission was...

12:29.960 --> 12:33.280
to watch over the Swedish-made

12:33.400 --> 12:36.160
GPS guided shells,

12:36.280 --> 12:38.480
so they would not fall
into the wrong hands.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.560
And yet they have disappeared
and you don't know where.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.520
That's not really what happened is it?

12:45.640 --> 12:48.120
Hamilton's mission was

12:48.240 --> 12:51.360
to map the networks
dealing with weapons.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.440
It may be that that was
the mission you gave him,

12:53.560 --> 12:56.400
but for the last 3 months
I have been the operational commander.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.160
And still I have not been
informed of these networks.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.240
Dimitri and the one who was to buy them
were killed in the attack.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.120
Then, perhaps your
mapping was not so good.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.160
Gentlemen.

13:18.520 --> 13:22.040
He's new ... and has to show off.

13:23.320 --> 13:27.560
Between us ...
What is your take on this group?

13:28.160 --> 13:31.120
Well-organized. Professionals.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.120
The man I had taken
out had a watch on...

13:35.121 --> 13:37.040
a Luminox.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.780
They seemed to be U.S.

13:39.781 --> 13:41.600
Special soldiers, most
likely Navy Seals.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.000
- Americans!
- Maybe.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.840
Awubere, Ethiopia.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.400
See, it comes up like that.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.960
Press F... Send, OK?

14:04.080 --> 14:06.000
Right now I'm going to
get the coordinates

14:06.001 --> 14:07.920
from my buddy, ok?
You hang on to that.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.360
You got the coordinates?

14:30.080 --> 14:31.300
- Are these the correct
GPS coordinates?

14:31.301 --> 14:32.520
- Uh huh.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.400
- It's densely populated.
- We're set to go.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.640
That's his home. The hit was
supposed to happen with Sidalman.

14:36.760 --> 14:37.880
Change in plans.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.560
Come on man...
Samata Rahim has two children ...

14:46.000 --> 14:49.600
No way ...
I do not murder children ...

14:50.840 --> 14:53.040
- They'll take all the blame.
You're not doing anything.

14:53.041 --> 14:55.240
- I just instructed him how
to use the coordinates.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.200
And? ... Lee, This is no
time to question orders.

15:06.440 --> 15:10.280
Abdullah whatever your fuckin' name is.
Here are the coordinates.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.000
Wait here.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.800
- Hey!
- Hey Benjamin,

16:18.960 --> 16:21.000
- Everything ok?
- Yeah.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.820
Oh, it shall be so
nice to get home.

16:22.821 --> 16:24.520
I have to fix some
presents to the kids.

16:24.640 --> 16:25.920
- Remind me to pick up
something at the airport.

16:25.921 --> 16:27.200
- No problem.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.840
Jesus ...

16:37.400 --> 16:38.280
Get out of the car!

16:38.400 --> 16:40.600
- You're not gonna warn him.
- Get out of the goddam car!

16:46.520 --> 16:48.160
Now what?

16:48.280 --> 16:50.680
You going to hide? We'll find you!

16:50.800 --> 16:53.880
You know you can't disappear.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.880
Now give me the gun.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.120
- Back off!
- Jesus!

16:58.240 --> 17:01.400
Or the next shot goes
right between the eyes.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.040
Lagerbäck, get over here.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.240
Come on, now!

17:09.880 --> 17:12.760
Ok.
- Drive!

17:13.560 --> 17:14.560
I said drive!

17:44.520 --> 17:45.280
I'm sorry.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.600
But it was not my intention
to drag you into this.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.320
Drag me into what?

17:56.480 --> 17:57.640
We worked together for a month,

17:57.760 --> 18:00.320
all of a sudden you pull a gun like
a maniac. What's going on?

18:00.800 --> 18:01.680
Lagerbäck ...

18:04.080 --> 18:06.280
You've been technical
advisor for Sectragon,

18:06.880 --> 18:09.040
who in turn have been
training terrorists.

18:10.760 --> 18:11.880
What are you talking about?

18:12.680 --> 18:14.920
Sectragon will come after me
with everything they got.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.360
So that's what you need me
for, I'm, I'm your hostage?

18:18.480 --> 18:19.080
No!

18:19.200 --> 18:21.520
But for your own safety, I
can't tell you any more.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.840
Now I'm going to Djibouti.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.360
From there you can get a safe
way back home to Sweden.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.720
We can work something out.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.840
You can take my money ...
You can have the money!

19:21.640 --> 19:22.720
What did he say? What's happening?

19:27.160 --> 19:28.800
Sweden ... I am a Swedish citizen

19:28.920 --> 19:31.920
You are on the wrong side of
the border, this is Somalia!

19:48.720 --> 19:51.360
Söder Hospital. Stockholm.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.040
I hope you won't have
to come in tonight.

20:02.480 --> 20:03.800
Bye, see you!

20:10.640 --> 20:11.640
Is it him?

20:12.920 --> 20:15.040
- Mmm.
- Good luck.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.240
What do you want?

20:41.320 --> 20:42.400
To see you.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.360
After four months?

20:48.760 --> 20:50.000
Forget it.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.360
You're right.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.480
I haven't told you who I am.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.760
What I'm doing.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.200
Why I disappear.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.120
But I never told you lies.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.560
No, but ...

21:08.840 --> 21:10.360
for four months.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.920
I'll try to explain,

21:13.360 --> 21:14.520
if you're willing to listen.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.240
You have lived as Russian

21:40.520 --> 21:42.080
with weapons smugglers?

21:46.200 --> 21:47.440
You're a spy.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.760
I'm an intelligence officer.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.320
Yes

21:56.360 --> 21:57.880
I thought you were cheating on
your wife or something like that.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.280
I've thought about you
every day since I left.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.840
I understand if you can't
handle it anymore.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.880
If you don't want to see me.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.240
But I wanted to see you.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.640
When I was over there,

22:30.200 --> 22:31.560
this time, it ...

22:35.160 --> 22:36.400
it made me think.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.360
About what?

22:38.840 --> 22:40.480
That I want to change my life.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.000
What would you change it to?

22:42.120 --> 22:44.040
I want to live my life with you.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.360
That's what I want to do.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.280
I've done the other.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.920
Let's go home.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.320
We have a problem in Somalia.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.040
We are waiting for the go-ahead
from the government,

24:10.160 --> 24:12.040
about how it should be handled.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.120
I will arrange it so that
you get all the info.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.600
It might be a link to Afghanistan.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.720
Get ready to go again.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.600
Are you having me followed?

24:23.920 --> 24:25.000
No.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.720
<i>- It's not someone I recognize.
- I'll check it out.</i>

24:29.000 --> 24:32.200
And I'll check out Mary as well.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.560
She was the last one you
were with before you left Sweden.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.120
How the hell do you know about that?

24:38.720 --> 24:42.320
- Do you think that she's involved?
- What do you think?

24:43.440 --> 24:44.560
I think you're wrong.

24:44.680 --> 24:45.760
I'm coming.

24:45.880 --> 24:46.920
Be careful.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.320
Bye.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.480
I'm on call.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.080
I have an emergency surgery,
so I have to go into ...

24:57.560 --> 24:58.480
Ok.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.320
You stay here!

25:02.840 --> 25:04.360
I'm going to make breakfast later.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.920
Prime Minister's Office. Stockholm.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.560
So we don't know where Lagerbäck is?

30:09.680 --> 30:11.640
Or whether he's alive?

30:13.880 --> 30:15.520
Have you gotten any
new information?

30:16.200 --> 30:18.720
Yes. Lagerbäck is in Somalia.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.760
Imprisoned.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.880
- Imprisoned?
Yes.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.040
Yep.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.320
Clas Olofsson.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.280
What was Lagerbäck
doing in Ethiopia?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.920
Lagerbäck was there
on a personal trip.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.600
He disappeared on the
border with Somalia.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.560
Isn't that an extremely
dangerous region

30:40.561 --> 30:42.400
to choose as a
private destination?

30:42.520 --> 30:45.160
We have no further details about
his captivity at the moment.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.480
Do you think that his work with you on

30:47.600 --> 30:50.000
advanced high-tech weapons
may have something

30:50.120 --> 30:52.000
- to do with his disappearance?
- No. I don't think so.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.280
But that's a suspicion that's
just hard to ignore.

30:54.400 --> 30:57.480
You as deputy director at the
North Fors, should really know

30:57.600 --> 30:59.360
what he was doing there.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.320
Martin Lagerbäck worked with education.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.240
All of us at the North Fors Industries
hope that the government

31:06.800 --> 31:09.760
do their utmost so that he may soon
be reunited with his family.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.640
Do you think, Prime Minister, that this

31:12.760 --> 31:15.560
can get in the way of the
coming peace conference?

31:15.680 --> 31:19.040
This, among other things, Ethiopia's
prime minister, Josef Bekele

31:19.160 --> 31:21.200
- will be there?
- Fire!

31:23.040 --> 31:25.760
The conference is an
opportunity for Josef Bekele

31:25.920 --> 31:27.880
and the other parties to
create stability in

31:28.000 --> 31:28.880
the region.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.760
Will you, as Minister, now take a
closer look at your appointments

31:32.920 --> 31:34.420
since North Fors
Industries is involved,

31:34.421 --> 31:35.920
in order to see if
there are links

31:36.040 --> 31:39.040
- to the countries in the region?
- Hmm, uh, no.

31:39.640 --> 31:43.520
Since Lagerbäcks disappearance has
nothing to do with business.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.520
- So ...
- That's not what I asked.

31:45.640 --> 31:50.480
Will the government not investigate
North Fors' denial that Lagerbäck

31:50.600 --> 31:52.320
was there in Ethiopia on business
at their expense?

31:52.440 --> 31:55.120
The idea that Sweden would be involved

31:55.240 --> 31:58.920
in the handling of weapons
in the region is ridiculous.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.840
Sweden has never

32:01.000 --> 32:04.760
and will never approve weapons
to warring countries.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.560
So you think we should
employ a security company?

32:29.680 --> 32:32.120
A private army to rescue Lagerbäck?

32:32.240 --> 32:35.000
Mmm. Well no, not us, but
North Fors Industries.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.120
Clas Olofsson contacted me
and suggested this idea.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.600
How would it really take place?

32:41.280 --> 32:42.480
Sara ...

32:43.080 --> 32:45.600
let Sectragon take care of this.
They are pros.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.880
Two years ago,

32:49.040 --> 32:51.480
Sectragon saved

32:51.600 --> 32:54.160
six Dutch aid workers in Colombia,

32:54.280 --> 32:58.600
and last year there were two
French doctors in Mogadishu.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.640
I want a Swedish person.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.280
Someone with experience
in situations like this.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.640
Yes.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.040
The killer has taken some photographs.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.120
Probably someone from
Poland who contacted her.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.560
I believe that the killer is
trying to lead us astray.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.000
Maria had awakened.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.080
She was called to come in,

33:30.200 --> 33:32.000
at 23:45.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.720
Why would she make her
bed before she left?

33:35.240 --> 33:37.880
Yes, perhaps she had not gone.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.360
What?
- No no.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.040
The doctor on duty sleeps when she can.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.520
How did she afford this apartment?

33:48.920 --> 33:50.320
The doctor on duty,

33:50.760 --> 33:54.400
You know ... "Go to work, get a life."

34:13.600 --> 34:15.520
Your plane leaves in about two hours.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.880
Read, then we'll go over the details.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.239
What do the police think?

34:25.800 --> 34:29.239
You made it look like the
killer has links to Poland.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.840
The apartment is clean,
the murder weapon is gone

34:31.960 --> 34:34.280
there is no incriminating evidence.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.080
Mary was innocent.

34:46.199 --> 34:49.600
You can't do this, unless
you can get past this.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.920
Samata Rahim.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.880
Somalian exiled politician.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.760
He was killed in a
bomb attack yesterday.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.240
No one has accepted the blame.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.120
Take a look.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.800
Martin Lagerbäck.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.200
Employed by North Fors Industries.

35:19.240 --> 35:23.280
He specializes in GPS and
laser-guided weapons.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.080
He was taken by Somali militia.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.920
North Fors has appointed

35:30.080 --> 35:31.760
Sectragon to free him.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.680
I am convinced

35:34.800 --> 35:38.880
that these Sky Shadow weapons
that disappeared in Afghanistan

35:39.480 --> 35:41.360
are now located in Somalia.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.920
You should be with

35:44.040 --> 35:45.800
Lagerbäck when he's released,

35:46.560 --> 35:48.560
and make sure he comes home to Sweden.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.400
You fly to Djibouti.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.240
I need a few hours in Beirut.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.160
If I do this, then I do it my way.

35:58.280 --> 36:00.060
Get home Lagerbäck, no detours.

36:00.061 --> 36:01.840
It was Mansfield's
security requirements.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.320
Keep him away from me.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.880
He's not going to be happy
with that, landing in Beirut.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.240
Beirut. Lebanon.

36:38.920 --> 36:42.160
- Mona, looking great!
- You look tired.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.480
I need a back door.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.400
I have a contact in Somalia.
His name is Chad.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.880
- Tareq you're still hanging around.
- Mr. Hamilton.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.080
Carl ...

36:56.080 --> 36:59.800
Is this about the terror attack in
Ethiopia, using Swedish weapons?

37:01.240 --> 37:03.520
We might be small, but
we are not blind.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.360
Terrorists with high-tech
weapons is not a good sign.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.880
Terrorists?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.600
Well, everything about this
points to Al-Shabab in Somalia.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.080
Apparently you know more than I do.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.520
That's not good.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.240
Don't worry.

37:20.680 --> 37:24.040
You're here as an observer and
asking me for a back door.

37:24.840 --> 37:27.280
Is there anything else I
shouldn't worry about?

37:30.120 --> 37:32.080
I'll get in contact if necessary.

37:33.320 --> 37:34.560
I have a plane to catch.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.240
Somalia.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.200
- Hamilton?
- Rob Hart?

38:07.880 --> 38:11.000
Okay, three things.
Firstly, you're under my command.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.320
Secondly, you're here
just as an observer.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.760
And thirdly ... hey!

38:15.520 --> 38:18.480
Thirdly, we will do our job ...
whatever happens.

38:19.440 --> 38:20.920
And that is?
- Complete the mission

38:21.480 --> 38:23.840
- You understand?
- Absolutely.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.840
Miller, make sure he's
dressed for the occasion.

38:27.880 --> 38:28.800
Follow me.

38:51.520 --> 38:54.320
In case things get serious.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.520
Make sure he stays up front boss.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.680
- What do you have?
- The usual.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.320
- Nothing unusual?
No!

39:43.560 --> 39:44.640
Go ahead.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.960
- Go.
- Close the door.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.400
With me. Keys. Ok, keep focused!

40:10.520 --> 40:11.920
Let's go!

40:30.920 --> 40:32.200
Hurry up!

40:34.680 --> 40:35.640
Come on!

40:36.840 --> 40:38.040
Move!

40:48.680 --> 40:49.520
Put it down!

40:52.400 --> 40:53.960
Come on, come on!

41:26.360 --> 41:27.280
Go!

41:51.360 --> 41:52.560
Drop the gun!

41:58.280 --> 41:59.600
Where is he?

42:09.000 --> 42:10.120
It's him.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.160
Who are you?

42:14.040 --> 42:15.240
Where's the American?

42:16.640 --> 42:17.440
Hey.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.080
Hey, we're done here!

42:24.600 --> 42:26.560
You say nothing! You understand?

42:31.240 --> 42:32.080
Ok.

42:50.680 --> 42:53.080
- Drop the gun.
- Gun Down!

42:53.200 --> 42:54.280
Put down your weapon.

44:24.920 --> 44:27.760
What? You thought we wouldn't find you?

44:27.880 --> 44:30.160
Let me make something perfectly clear.

44:30.280 --> 44:32.800
You're a fucking traitor!

44:40.040 --> 44:41.440
What are you going to do to me now?

44:41.560 --> 44:42.720
Who are you?

44:47.440 --> 44:50.080
- Drink!
- You're Swedish ...

44:51.320 --> 44:53.680
Drink! You're dehydrated.

44:55.320 --> 44:58.040
There's going to be many questions
asked when you return to Sweden.

44:58.720 --> 45:01.520
You have not been in Ethiopia to work,
do you understand what I'm saying?

45:01.640 --> 45:03.040
- I know, I know ...
- Listen!

45:03.280 --> 45:07.080
It looks like you're involved
with stolen weapons for North Fors.

45:08.360 --> 45:11.720
- I didn't know. I just trained them.
- Who's "them?"

45:12.600 --> 45:13.840
Sectragon.

45:15.240 --> 45:18.240
Two days ago Sky Shadow shell
struck a target in Ethiopia,

45:18.840 --> 45:20.840
it was fired from Somalia.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.000
Oh fuck ...

45:26.120 --> 45:28.200
Then it's true, what he said.

45:29.800 --> 45:30.720
Who?

45:32.080 --> 45:33.200
Benjamin Lee.

45:35.280 --> 45:36.660
- The man who sat in
the cell next to you?

45:36.661 --> 45:38.040
- Yes.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.360
He worked for Sectragon,

45:39.480 --> 45:41.160
He ran off to tell
the authorities that

45:41.161 --> 45:42.840
they have trained
terrorists in Somalia.

45:48.080 --> 45:48.920
Ok.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.360
What's going to happen now?

45:53.160 --> 45:54.040
We're going home.

46:05.360 --> 46:06.480
Where are we taking them?

46:06.600 --> 46:09.200
You go with Miller, Miller
take him to the hotel.

46:09.640 --> 46:10.920
Come on we're moving out!

46:11.880 --> 46:13.280
What about Lagerbäck?

46:14.360 --> 46:17.680
You've done your bit.
Lagerbäck will be home in a few days.

46:18.720 --> 46:21.400
Ok.
Hey!

46:23.240 --> 46:24.880
You forgetting something?

46:49.800 --> 46:53.280
Sectragon Headquarters. Dallas.

46:53.680 --> 46:54.600
Yes.

46:56.160 --> 46:57.080
Hello?

46:57.520 --> 47:00.160
Smith? It's Hart here sir ...

47:00.280 --> 47:01.880
Hold on sir ...

47:04.720 --> 47:05.600
Sir!

47:21.640 --> 47:23.360
The prison extraction is complete.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.320
The Swede and Lee are out.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.840
- Has anyone else talked to him?
- No sir!

47:30.960 --> 47:32.440
The helo's coming in now.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.000
Yes sir!

48:04.080 --> 48:06.160
- Well, do you know what to do?
- Yes sir!

48:15.240 --> 48:16.280
Take care of it.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.640
- Take care of him.
Ok.

49:22.120 --> 49:24.520
Sectragon Headquarters, Dallas.

49:24.640 --> 49:28.160
We require freedom of movement.

49:29.160 --> 49:31.640
There is an individual
we need to retrieve.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.040
Without creating any problems.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.720
Can that be arranged?

49:37.320 --> 49:38.720
What did you have in mind?

49:41.000 --> 49:43.120
I would like to see
his name on the list.

49:55.920 --> 49:57.920
What did you do for Sectragon?

50:03.120 --> 50:04.040
Trust me.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.680
Or I leave you out here, your choice.

50:09.520 --> 50:10.960
My field was information.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.240
Intelligence service.

50:14.480 --> 50:17.160
Black operations. Who the hell are you?

50:18.480 --> 50:21.000
I'm a Commander in the Swedish
Intelligence Service.

50:23.680 --> 50:26.160
What do you know about the
missing shells in Afghanistan?

50:30.880 --> 50:32.200
Take me to Sweden with you,

50:32.320 --> 50:33.760
and I'll tell you all I know.

50:33.880 --> 50:36.240
One was used to take out an exiled

50:36.360 --> 50:38.240
Somalian politician in Ethiopia.

50:39.760 --> 50:41.080
Samata Rahim.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.040
I tried to stop that.

50:46.760 --> 50:47.720
That's why I'm here.

50:50.160 --> 50:52.880
Why is Sectragon supplying
terrorists in Somalia?

50:54.640 --> 50:56.720
They are prepared to go all the way.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.720
By any means necessary if they have to.

51:03.280 --> 51:04.640
I'm not saying another word.

51:06.920 --> 51:08.840
Either you take me to
Sweden with you ...

51:10.960 --> 51:14.160
Or you leave me here. Your choice.

51:16.440 --> 51:17.560
We'll protect you.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.120
You stay put.

51:38.880 --> 51:40.960
Mr. Hamilton? I'm Chad.

51:41.760 --> 51:42.840
Mona sends her regards.

51:43.160 --> 51:44.120
So walk with me.

51:49.400 --> 51:51.360
Lee, this is Chad.

51:52.160 --> 51:53.200
You go with him.

51:59.240 --> 52:00.640
We'll meet later in Amman.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.560
Stockholm.

52:11.840 --> 52:15.480
The Government has been able to get
kidnapped Martin Lagerbäck home.

52:15.600 --> 52:17.400
He was been imprisoned in Somalia.

52:17.520 --> 52:20.560
And the militant
Islamist group Al-Shabab

52:20.680 --> 52:23.760
took credit today for the
murder of the exiled Somali

52:23.880 --> 52:27.200
politician Samata Rahim and his family.

52:27.320 --> 52:30.640
The Ethiopian intelligence service
thinks the strike took place

52:30.760 --> 52:33.640
with a Swedish GPS guided
shell known as a Sky Shadow.

52:33.760 --> 52:37.520
U.S. military leaders think the
development in the area is disturbing.

52:37.840 --> 52:41.200
Both Al Qaeda and Al-Shabab
have strong roots in Somalia.

52:41.400 --> 52:44.080
And they now have high-tech weapons

52:44.240 --> 52:46.560
and knowledge of how to use them.

52:46.680 --> 52:48.980
This implies a changing power
shift, according to the

52:48.981 --> 52:51.280
African Foreign Ministry
expert, Jan Erik Ramfors.

53:01.600 --> 53:03.440
I want you to get to
the bottom of this.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.240
I want you to investigate

53:06.360 --> 53:09.920
all business that North Fors
Industries has been involved in

53:10.040 --> 53:11.360
in recent years.

53:11.361 --> 53:12.680
I want to know exactly
how this happened.

53:13.840 --> 53:16.480
Do you think Clas Olofsson
knows something we don't?

53:16.600 --> 53:18.520
He was very relaxed about
getting home Lagerbäck.

53:22.320 --> 53:26.120
If it turns out that there
have been any illegalities

53:26.680 --> 53:29.200
I don't want to find
out about it on TV.

53:29.520 --> 53:30.520
Yes.

53:44.440 --> 53:45.400
Hello?

53:48.240 --> 53:49.280
Hello?

53:50.280 --> 53:50.960
Hi

53:51.680 --> 53:55.000
Hey, I'm Anna Rune from the police.

53:55.120 --> 53:57.480
Yes, I wonder if you ...

53:58.240 --> 53:59.960
recognize this woman?

54:02.080 --> 54:05.400
Yes, she was here, with some man...
They sat there.

54:06.760 --> 54:08.920
Okay, this man had ...

54:09.040 --> 54:11.360
Amman, Jordan.

55:26.480 --> 55:28.800
- Aren't we supposed to meet tomorrow?
- Yes.

55:30.560 --> 55:31.840
But Tareq has some questions.

55:33.040 --> 55:35.160
- Tareq?
- Who is Benjamin Lee?

55:35.560 --> 55:37.000
He worked for Sectragon.

55:37.120 --> 55:39.720
He has information regarding
Swedish security.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.640
He works for them?

55:42.840 --> 55:45.600
So how come he's listed as
a terrorist in the U.S.?

55:49.720 --> 55:53.200
Anyone that helps Benjamin Lee
will be tagged as a terrorist.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.040
Sectragon has contacts,
that's why he's on that list.

56:00.840 --> 56:03.240
The purpose of that list is
to scare people like you.

56:05.440 --> 56:06.440
Do you remember Chad?

56:07.360 --> 56:07.960
Yea.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.240
The guy who helped you in Somalia.

56:11.040 --> 56:12.080
He's missing.

56:12.440 --> 56:14.280
If Chad talks, Mr. Hamilton,

56:14.440 --> 56:15.800
it's not going to be about you.

56:16.400 --> 56:19.240
The PLO must be out of this.

56:20.480 --> 56:22.800
We will trade Lee for Chad.

56:23.520 --> 56:24.520
Tareq, please.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.240
Can I have a moment alone with Mona?

56:30.960 --> 56:32.120
Don't discuss it any further.

56:33.120 --> 56:34.760
This is none of our business.

56:34.880 --> 56:37.000
Ok, Tareq. I will handle this.

56:38.200 --> 56:40.720
I hope we finish this
soon, Mr. Hamilton.

56:42.640 --> 56:44.280
- Bye.
- Bye.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.840
Are you aware that you have provoked
the largest private army in the world?

56:53.600 --> 56:54.960
Well, it crossed my mind.

56:56.640 --> 57:00.440
I could not find any information
to link him to Sectragon, so

57:00.560 --> 57:02.280
Tareq is right.

57:02.440 --> 57:04.440
This is none of our
business and the PLO

57:04.441 --> 57:06.440
must not be associated
with terrorists.

57:07.320 --> 57:08.560
He is not a terrorist.

57:09.240 --> 57:11.560
Do you think I'd be here if
I didn't believe in him?

57:14.440 --> 57:15.960
They're not going to
leave you, you know?

57:17.480 --> 57:19.440
They're going to come after
you when this is over.

57:23.280 --> 57:26.000
You know I've been in this
business for over 20 years now,

57:26.680 --> 57:28.320
Statistically, my time is up.

57:33.480 --> 57:36.080
I need your contacts to get
Lee out of the country.

57:40.240 --> 57:41.920
I need you to trust me.

57:45.800 --> 57:46.880
I do.

57:51.840 --> 57:54.600
Somalia.

58:08.160 --> 58:09.760
Gonzalez ... Up!

58:14.040 --> 58:15.080
You've got a sister,

58:15.800 --> 58:17.200
talk or she'll be here next.

58:20.600 --> 58:21.840
In Amman ...

58:22.360 --> 58:23.320
With who?

58:27.200 --> 58:28.120
With who?

58:35.600 --> 58:37.560
Think about your sister ...
Here with me.

58:41.720 --> 58:43.400
Who's your contact in Amman?

58:46.200 --> 58:47.360
Mona ...

58:47.520 --> 58:50.000
Mona Al-Fatha. And a man.

58:58.440 --> 59:01.520
Amman, Jordan.

59:25.600 --> 59:27.280
Salam Aleikum.

59:30.960 --> 59:34.000
Where is Lee. You take me to him.

59:47.480 --> 59:49.920
- Another time.
- You failed before.

59:51.600 --> 59:54.200
The border between
Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.

59:56.360 --> 59:57.400
It was you.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.720
When I'm finished with Lee,

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.840
I'm coming for you.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.720
As God wants.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.840
Hello.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880
You got him?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.800
I can take out Hamilton, repeat,
I can take out Hamilton.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.680
No, he'll lead us to Lee.
We'll take him out later.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.680
Hello.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.320
Call me Tareq.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.520
Sniper to the right on the roof. Go!

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.440
Tareq hurry to the car! Quick!

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.920
The car Tareq!

01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.440
Tareq!

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.680
What about Lee?

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.800
Did you get him?

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.320
Did you get him?

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.320
Tareq.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.160
I'm sorry.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.280
If people are going to sacrifice
their lives for you...

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.840
I want to know why.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.600
Why is my friend dead?

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.120
I said, answer me! What do you know?

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.080
Don't do it.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.200
Don't do it.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.880
I hope he's worth it.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.080
Wait here.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.120
Sit.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.240
May God have mercy on his soul.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.360
Keep an eye on them.
I'll be right back.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.040
I really appreciate all
the help you've given me.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.440
I used my friendship with
Mona to save your life.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.000
So now, I want you

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.520
tell me everything you know.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.160
War is extremely profitable for
an organization like Sectragon.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.520
Pentagon has fed over $10 billion
to private contractors in Iraq.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.160
The world is waiting for
Al-Shabab to strike again.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.560
And I know when and
where that'll happen.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.280
Hart's team will carry
out the operation.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.400
But Al-Shabab will get the blame.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.840
What will they do?

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.240
I'll give you more information
when I'm in safety.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.520
You are on the CIA's terrorist list.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.480
Sectragon has contacts in the CIA.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.000
- What can I do?

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:14.160
- Demand to speak to our
extra trial Prime Minister.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.720
That's your only chance to get
through to the right people.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.600
Ok.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.320
The airport is under surveillance.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.800
So we take you to Damascus.
You fly from there.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.760
Abu Omar, give me
something to cover him.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.840
Stockholm's archipelago.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.880
Mr. Lee ... Welcome.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.440
Your business is
finished now, Hamilton.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.320
This way please.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:18.840
I've already told you sir,

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.960
Only if I can speak directly
with the prime minister

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:26.160
will I speak about any information
concerning Sectragon.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.520
I don't think your negotiation
tactics serves you well,

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.399
beacause it's only a
matter of time before the

01:08:35.401 --> 01:08:37.840
CIA finds out that you
in Swedish custody.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.319
You remember that!

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.640
There was one thing, she
called me later in the night.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
She had forgotten her computer
and wanted me to look after it.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.319
- Do you have it here?
- Yes, come here.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.399
Ehm, this is the man who
was there with Mary.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.840
We have two witnesses
who can verify it.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.359
I want to know if I can publish
this picture in the press?

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.840
- Wait for a bit.
- Why?

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.640
Ehh ... There's something
I have to check.

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:22.359
Check what?

01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:26.520
Was I unclear? Was there anything
I said you don't understand?

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.560
- You know who it is don't you?
- Back off for now, back off.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.120
North Fors Industries, Stockholm.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.000
The Foreign Ministry
has not approved any

01:09:45.001 --> 01:09:46.720
end-user certificates that
have not been correct.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.600
There are no "hidden appointments"

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.359
no bribes ... No smuggling that
can be connected to North Fors.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.960
There's just one small detail that
will show up during an investigation.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.760
What?

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.460
That it was you who
pushed through the Sky

01:10:01.461 --> 01:10:03.240
Shadow agreement with
Hungary a year ago.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.000
Yes, but it was completely by the book.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.320
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.840
And now they are gone.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.560
And you have not been paid.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.760
And now they are being used
by Al-Shabab in Somalia.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.920
But, but wait a minute, what
the hell are you saying now?

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.360
What? Claas, what the hell?

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.760
Swedish intelligence has
a man in their custody.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.280
He knows all about this.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.280
- Yes, and, and who is it?
- His name is Benjamin Lee.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.880
And he's going to tell
everything he knows.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.280
So Benjamin Lee will need guarantees
from the Swedish government.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.260
- He wants a new
identity and protection.

01:10:43.261 --> 01:10:45.120
- Mmmm.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.000
And he will only talk directly
with you, personally.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.800
Well that's not a problem.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.600
Well unfortunately,

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.400
the U.S. has listed him as a terrorist.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.280
Benjamin Lee knows,

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.680
how step by step they are
setting the stage for a war in

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.920
Horn of Africa.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.120
But these claims come from a terrorist.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.400
Is there any evidence?

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.920
No!

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.680
- Benjamin Lee is credible.
- So, he's credible?

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:19.000
Are we suppossed to ignore
information that comes from the CIA?

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.400
Sectragon is planning an assassination

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.560
where the blame is
placed on terrorists.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.120
When it happens, a war in
the region is inevitable.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.640
Get him to talk.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.320
On Tuesday, Joseph Bekele will
be at the peace conference.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.400
I want to know everything
that Benjamin Lee knows.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.320
According to sources in
American military leadership

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.920
there is a planned a series of
military exercises in Somalia.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.560
Ethiopia's prime minister, Josef Bekele

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.580
who has worked for a
peaceful development

01:11:53.581 --> 01:11:55.480
between countries in
the Horn of Africa,

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.840
is worried about the
future of the region,

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.560
and fears new violence
between countries.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.060
And we continue now
with new information

01:12:03.061 --> 01:12:04.720
about the murder of
Dr. Maria Solska.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.560
According to a police spokesman,
certain evidence has been found

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.080
that shows there's a link to Poland

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.720
where Maria Solska had
visited 11 times in recent years.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.600
Carl!

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.760
I want you to talk to Lee.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.320
My new boss says I'm finished with it.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.760
You're the only one who
can get him to talk.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.040
You are the only one Benjamin trusts.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.080
There was another person who
trusted me, but she's dead now.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.280
Let Maria Solska go.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.680
It was an accident.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.920
That was no fucking
accident, it was a reflex.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.560
You know that as well.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.520
I've been training to
master it for 20 years.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.920
It has saved my life many times.

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:46.320
It only took a split second ...
I killed Mary.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.120
You're wrong.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.760
Tomorrow ...

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.320
I'm turning myself in.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.960
You stand outside the system,

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.080
and there's a good reason for it.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.680
You should protect the nation's
interests, when necessary.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.480
I am trained to kill in
the nation's interest.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.880
But I can't.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.640
I can't anymore.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.680
I loved her.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.600
Do you understand?

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.520
Mary's death was perhaps ...
a reflex as you say.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:37.840
But the same reflex saved
Benjamin Lee's life.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.680
So I ask you

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.840
talk to Lee.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.120
<i>Do it before going to the police.</i>

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.960
You're too late.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.960
I already told them
everything about the attack.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.640
Who have you told?

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.680
Who?

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.680
Benjamin Lee is gone.

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.960
Here's what we'll do, I
will meet you and Vernman

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:03.240
We have a leak ... Otherwise Sectragon
would never have found him.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.920
We must get him back.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.160
No. I'll handle this.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.440
I do this my way now.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.920
Carl, you work for me.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.000
You'll hear from me.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.160
You can't do this alone.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.880
I'm not alone.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.520
Can you explain to me how the hell

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.160
Sectragon could find him here?

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.000
How do you know it was them?

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.400
Who else could it be?

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.360
The monitoring files are gone.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.000
Damn.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:42.480
Thanks.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.440
Thomas, can I have a word with you?

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.240
Benjamin Lee is gone. He may be dead.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.440
Three Swedish soldiers responsible
for his safety were killed.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.280
Someone leaked where he was.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.160
Well.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.080
No, but what ...

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.920
It was only you and I
who knew where he was.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.640
But my god Sara, are you accusing me?

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.320
Benjamin Lee is a wanted
terrorist, that's all we know.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.360
How do we know for sure that someone
from our own Intelligence Service

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.880
didn't do it?

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:20.680
Or, or if it was

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.540
Benjamin Lee who killed
our men and then ran ...

01:18:22.541 --> 01:18:24.280
We don't know this.

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.480
No.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.000
But I'll figure it out now.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.400
Thank you for helping me.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.320
I'm doing this for Tareq.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.040
- So, this is where you hide out?
- Yea.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.280
See that?

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.880
There.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.760
That's Hart.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.400
Yea, but how did he find Lee?

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.920
Is there a leak?

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.200
Yea, apparently.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.800
But I never heard a
word about an attack.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.400
- Yea, but he's lying.
- He had to survive.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.000
And as soon as Hart realizes
this, he will kill him.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.480
So we go for Hart.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.320
He will lead the way to Lee.

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.240
Did you know her?

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.960
Yea ... she was murdered.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.400
Who did it?

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.640
So what happened?

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.640
Maria Solska?

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.240
Is she involved with this?

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.720
Did she work for Sectragon?

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.080
No.

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.240
Was it your fault?

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.280
I slit her throat.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.080
Can I trust you?

01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.360
What?

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.320
If we meet Hart and it
comes to combat ...

01:21:03.321 --> 01:21:05.040
Can I trust you?

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.360
"I've been doing this for
almost 20 years now."

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.160
"Statistically, my time is up,"

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.440
- You said that to me back
in Amman, didn't you?

01:21:16.441 --> 01:21:17.960
- Yes, I did.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.920
So, is that what you prefer?

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.800
A bullet from Hart?

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.720
But this doesn't work for me, Carl.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.040
You know ...

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.040
I started to imagine
a life with her ...

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.280
A life?

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.680
You mean like just an ordinary life?

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.200
- Like, a life.
- Carl!

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.400
You are who you are, why
can't you just accept it?

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.000
She was innocent.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.520
Well she was not the only one.

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:14.360
And right now Carl, the only
thing I want to know is

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.120
I can trust you or not.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.360
- Do you understand?
Yes

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.320
You can trust me.

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:34.800
I'm at home, we need
to know what you know.

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.080
So call me.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.800
Hello! I am looking for Carl Hamilton.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.520
What is it?

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:50.320
That's a very vague
answer to my question

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.560
Johanna ... Yes, come in..

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.280
- Is Carl at home?
- No.

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.680
You can speak with me, I'm his father.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.640
What has the boy done now?

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.240
You are not his dad.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.760
How did you track him?

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.200
Through you.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.320
I talked with your boss,

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.800
and then came to visit him
when we met yesterday.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.320
The reason for the meeting
was initiated by you.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.480
I saw you.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.520
I was just waiting for you to show up.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.120
Carl has killed a woman, do you
think it's right to protect him?

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.880
If this did happen,

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.600
Hamilton

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.640
is one of our most valuable assets.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.200
So now I ask you, and I ask only once

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.440
forget about this little crusade ...

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.400
So you think I should just drop it?

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.600
One time I said, not two!

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.640
Shall we go?

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.120
Sectragon Headquarters, Dallas.

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.840
Lee has been talking.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.240
And the damage?

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.040
- Relatively small.
- Do what you have to.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:18.080
And if it involves the
Swedish Prime Minister?

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.640
Josef Bekele will die ...
Just not how we planned it.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.280
But his death will have
exactly the same impact.

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:31.080
You see, flexibility is the
cornerstone of our profession.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.160
If we remain flexible,
we maintain control.

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.840
- Control?
- Al-Shabab will take the blame.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.360
And the new Ethiopian
government will join us

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.640
in the war against terror.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:47.120
Stockholm.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.520
Hi!
- Good morning.

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.980
- I called earlier and
made a reservation.

01:24:55.981 --> 01:24:57.320
- Yes.

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.400
Is this a room with a
view of the bridge?

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.440
Absolutely sir, we
arranged that for you.

01:25:05.441 --> 01:25:07.360
It's room 5083.

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.560
Welcome Mr. Lee.

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:40.800
Let's check the timings.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.240
All set and clear.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.800
Blue Lexus.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:55.440
Boom.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.520
We're good to go.

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.440
- Saliva and DNA on this?
- Yea.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.800
Good.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.240
Hey!

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.440
It's too big, it'll take
out half the hotel.

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.280
No, there's a construction
flaw in the belt.

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.000
Parts of his head and
torso will remain intact.

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:33.720
The belt sir.

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.360
Hart. Hart, wuts you doing?

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.400
- Hart, please, listen to me.
- We are at war.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.920
You remember that?

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.700
- Please ...

01:26:47.701 --> 01:26:49.640
- Josef Bekele will die,
for the greater good.

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:54.320
For the world to see what happens
when terrorism takes a foothold.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.520
You brought this on yourself.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:03.120
You'll take out two heads of state,
before you blow up yourself up.

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.280
You didn't see that coming, did you?

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.480
When you turned yourself against us.

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.040
Who the hell are you?

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:32.360
Wait ...

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:38.920
Have you ever used weapons?

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.040
Have you killed anyone?

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.880
Sixteen people died on the border
between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.160
A family was wiped out
by a Sky Shadow mortar

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.600
in Somalia.

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.520
You murdered them.

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.040
You didn't press the button

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.440
but you murdered them.

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:03.120
Benjamin Lee explained everything to me
before Hart kidnapped him.

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.480
If you do not turn yourself in...
And tell everything

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.880
I'll come back. I promise!

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.320
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.320
- Hart! We have to meet.
- What happened?

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.560
A man came into my office
and threatened to kill me.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.220
- He knew everything.

01:28:40.221 --> 01:28:42.120
- Listen, you keep your
shit together, you hear me?

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.880
- Meet me at the lay by in the woods.
- Ok.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.400
They took the bait.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.640
Thank you Mr. Bekele
for coming to Sweden.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.160
It is my pleasure.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:46.480
I'm sorry.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.800
- What did he know?
- He knew about you kidnapping Lee.

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.000
- When did it happen?
- About 30 minutes ago ...

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.480
- Miller.
- Yes sir.

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.120
- Are we alone?
- No, Hamilton is following.

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.160
The package is on time for delivery.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:08.240
Get back to the hotel Clarion now!

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.040
Sure. He's a dead man.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.040
Out!

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:23.400
Problem solved ... Let's go!

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.120
Go!

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.720
I go for sniper

01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.200
you take the other one.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:31.880
Son of a bitch!

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:44.120
Ten minutes.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.920
Get up! Get up!

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.160
Drop it, or I'll cut her throat.

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.880
- Shoot him ...
- Shut the fuck up!

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.680
- Shoot him!
- Drop it, or she's dead.

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.280
It's good,

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.600
I'm ok.

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.040
It went right through, right through.

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:23.640
You will be fine.

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.280
We gotta go! Gotta go!

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.920
We know that Swedish weapons were used.

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.000
North Fors Industries,

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.640
are involved ...

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.040
and Sectragon carried
the operation out.

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.480
Sectragon?

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:03.800
Carl,

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.160
you know where he is and
he thinks you're dead.

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.840
You must see a doctor.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.440
You know what to do.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:15.680
Miller, come in.

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.080
Miller!

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.800
Miller, come in.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:29.560
Wait ...

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.200
Carl, please come back.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.200
- Heard anything?
No

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:03.840
Shit.

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:05.560
How long?

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.720
Four minutes.

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.120
This number will blow the bridge

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.800
then you've got one hour to
get to the assembly point.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.920
- Let's do this!
- Good luck! - Yes sir.

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.200
Let's Rock!

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.360
I blow up Lee ...

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.320
we both die.

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:49.720
Is that what you want?

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:53.560
Mona Al-Fatha,

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.800
she was in a car outside.

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:57.880
We have her.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.760
I make a call ...

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.400
you have her, I walk ...
Problem solved.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.480
I mean what I say.

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.040
Now I need my telephone ...

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.240
Do it.

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:15.960
Make the call.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.080
Careful ...

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.920
Room 5083.

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:51.160
Everything is there.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.800
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to talk to you.

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.800
I'll talk with you when
you are sentenced ...

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.360
It's not going to happen.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.680
Maria died ... because I am who I am.

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:33.840
I'm not going to be judged.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.320
But I will live with this ...

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:39.480
the rest of my life.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.320
It is in the national interest

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.480
that it is a well-kept secret.

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:46.920
Yes.

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.840
It is fact in the nation's interest.

01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:56.440
I'm here

01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:59.480
to ask you to let it go.

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:09.960
Wait ...

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:14.680
here.

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.080
It's yours.

01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:59.000
