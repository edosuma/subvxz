WEBVTT

00:52.152 --> 00:53.218
<i>Amen.</i>

00:55.122 --> 00:57.489
Dear lord, our father in heaven.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.392
You are the physician
of our souls.

01:00.394 --> 01:05.831
We beseech thee, protect
this young woman's soul...

01:08.969 --> 01:11.236
our lord and savior...

01:15.075 --> 01:19.110
<i>Vanquish this diabolic being.</i>

01:19.112 --> 01:21.646
Protect this young woman,
body and soul,

01:21.648 --> 01:25.016
from all spiritual poison.

01:25.018 --> 01:28.753
<i>In the name of Jesus Christ,
our lord and savior...</i>

01:30.691 --> 01:36.027
young woman...

01:36.029 --> 01:38.296
Hello, gorgeous.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.613
Hello, Ava.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.348
I'm father merino.

03:03.350 --> 03:07.085
Your parents asked me
to be here to help.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.757
Boy it's nice to,
to see the real you.

03:14.695 --> 03:18.196
You see, I've been here
for a while...

03:18.198 --> 03:20.599
But it wasn't you
that I was talking with.

03:22.536 --> 03:29.741
I-it was an ancient,
malicious entity,

03:29.743 --> 03:31.543
and it's gone now.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.279
It's not possible.

03:34.281 --> 03:35.714
No, no.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.584
This is a joke, right?

03:39.586 --> 03:41.219
This is... this is a joke.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.088
I know you're frightened

03:43.090 --> 03:48.159
and exhausted and confused,
but it's not a joke.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.763
You've been being controlled
by a spirit

03:51.765 --> 03:53.531
that was not your own.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.704
Okay, okay.

04:00.774 --> 04:01.973
Let's pray.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.444
Dear father in heaven.

04:06.446 --> 04:11.916
Thank you for returning Ava,
to this life.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.994
How are you feeling, Ava?

04:22.996 --> 04:24.829
There she is.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.866
Hey Ava, you look great.
Hope you're hungry.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.467
Cut it out.

04:29.469 --> 04:32.337
What? She looks great.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.449
How long has it been?

04:44.451 --> 04:47.452
It's been a month, Ava.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.089
Did anyone call in sick for me?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.458
Uh...

04:53.460 --> 04:54.526
I doubt it.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.666
More lo mein?

05:01.668 --> 05:03.835
No, I'm good, thanks.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.003
Ava.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.672
This thing that managed to get
inside of you

05:07.674 --> 05:11.476
should be a real wake-up call.

05:11.478 --> 05:15.814
Are you, uh, are you still
smoking marijuana?

05:17.350 --> 05:20.018
Are you seriously blaming me
for getting possessed?

05:20.020 --> 05:23.288
I mean, it's
a gateway drug, okay?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.527
<i>I wish you would let us
put you in a hotel.</i>

05:29.529 --> 05:31.062
Your father's right, darling.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.198
You really can't live like this.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.766
I didn't have time to clean.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.901
Oh Ava, it's a dump.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.704
It doesn't matter
how much you clean it up.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.940
Well, we're gonna
come back and check on you.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.608
Whatever, just call first.

05:43.610 --> 05:44.676
Uh-huh.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.009
Oh, sweetie.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.647
I guess the district attorney,

06:22.649 --> 06:26.417
uh, has several videos
like this.

06:26.419 --> 06:30.655
And you're up for indictment
for multiple charges.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.924
Wait, what other charges?

06:32.926 --> 06:34.092
What other charges?

06:34.094 --> 06:39.330
Ava, you...
Property damage, assault,

06:39.332 --> 06:42.667
indecent exposure,
two counts of possession...

06:44.638 --> 06:46.237
Narcotics.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.409
I mean, we're talking about
serious jail time here.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.445
Jail?

06:54.447 --> 06:56.347
Bloody maniac,
running through the streets,

06:56.349 --> 07:00.685
like, hurting people
usually go to jail.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.187
Yeah.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.122
Your... your... your parents
are lobbying to put you

07:04.124 --> 07:07.025
in some kind of
residential facility.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.793
But I don't belong
in a facility.

07:08.795 --> 07:12.096
No, you don't,
you don't belong in a facility.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.333
There is a third option
and it's called, uh,

07:15.335 --> 07:17.836
spirit possession anonymous.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.504
It's funded by the government.

07:19.506 --> 07:23.341
It's in association
with the church, go figure.

07:23.343 --> 07:26.377
And you go
through the treatment and...

07:26.379 --> 07:29.047
And they erase all the charges.

07:30.884 --> 07:34.986
One thing, you are required
to study this handbook

07:34.988 --> 07:38.656
so you're prepared
for the first day.

07:38.658 --> 07:42.527
It's kind of, uh, like aa
for people like you.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.535
Okay, yeah,
I'll go with option three.

07:50.537 --> 07:53.404
Okay, I'm gonna
inform the judge right now.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.140
I think you made a fantastic
decision, sweetheart.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.500
Hello?

09:15.288 --> 09:17.522
<i>Hey Carl, it's me.</i>

09:19.159 --> 09:23.995
<i>I'd love to hear your voice.
I really miss you.</i>

09:23.997 --> 09:26.164
Please call me back
as soon as you get this.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.341
How 'bout tomorrow?

09:38.678 --> 09:40.611
Okay, just let him know
I'm feeling better

09:40.613 --> 09:43.081
and I can come back to work.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.351
<i>Okay.</i>

10:06.373 --> 10:11.142
"To Conrad.
Thirty years of wedded bliss."

10:11.144 --> 10:12.877
Who's Conrad?

10:14.214 --> 10:15.480
<i>Hello?</i>

10:15.482 --> 10:17.148
<i>Hey, how's it goin'?</i>

10:17.150 --> 10:19.784
<i>Uh... are you better now?</i>

10:19.786 --> 10:21.519
<i>I guess so.</i>

10:21.521 --> 10:23.688
<i>Sarah says hi.</i>

10:23.690 --> 10:25.857
Hi, Sarah.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.859
Do you guys maybe want to
hang out later?

10:27.861 --> 10:30.128
She wants to hang out.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.162
Um...

10:31.164 --> 10:34.966
<i>Sarah asks if it's safe.</i>

10:34.968 --> 10:36.200
Tell Sarah to wear a raincoat

10:36.202 --> 10:38.903
'cause I've got pea soup
spraying out of my butt.

10:38.905 --> 10:41.339
That's an exorcist reference.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.976
<i>Yeah, I know, it was funny.</i>

10:44.978 --> 10:46.577
<i>She sounds normal.</i>

10:46.579 --> 10:47.578
<i>Okay.</i>

10:47.580 --> 10:49.080
<i>We'll text you.</i>

11:17.777 --> 11:18.943
Cheers!

11:19.946 --> 11:25.016
So... was it
kinda like being pregnant?

11:25.018 --> 11:27.618
'Cause you had this thing
inside of you.

11:27.620 --> 11:31.289
I pictured that as being
a more beautiful experience.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.590
W-what are you gonna do

11:32.592 --> 11:35.793
about picking up
the pieces of your life?

11:35.795 --> 11:37.128
My life's not really in pieces.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.798
I just have
a few things to sort out.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.367
It'll be back to normal
next week.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.969
Totally.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.037
Yeah.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.541
Whoo.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.077
So what's up with
Roxanne's birthday party?

11:53.079 --> 11:54.479
Did it change?

11:55.815 --> 12:00.952
Um, well, you're sort of
not invited anymore.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.888
People are just
really freaked out still.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.056
Yeah.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.724
And you sort of
acted like a mega-bitch

12:06.726 --> 12:08.159
while you were possessed.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.161
And a slut.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.797
W-which is fine,

12:12.799 --> 12:17.935
but you did sleep with
Roxanne's boyfriend.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.637
Does Carl know?

12:19.639 --> 12:22.140
I don't know the detail...
I just heard.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.043
Ava...

12:29.682 --> 12:30.815
What is it?

12:31.851 --> 12:33.217
Do you hear that?

12:35.188 --> 12:36.320
Hear what?

12:50.870 --> 12:51.950
Something's wrong with her.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.340
Fuck, I knew
we shouldn't have come here!

13:01.347 --> 13:04.081
Ava, are you okay?

13:06.452 --> 13:08.519
What just happened, Ava?

13:08.521 --> 13:10.254
Nothing. I-I-I...

13:11.457 --> 13:15.026
I-I just drank that too fast.

13:15.028 --> 13:18.129
You guys should just go
'cause you're gonna be late.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.897
Are you upset?

13:19.899 --> 13:22.800
No, no, I just,
I have a lot of stuff to do

13:22.802 --> 13:27.104
and, uh, pieces of my life
to pick up and whatnot.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.907
Okay.

13:29.909 --> 13:32.743
Well, we'll give Roxanne
a kiss for you.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.645
Oh, I'm sure she'll love that.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.187
Oh, shit!

14:43.549 --> 14:44.682
Shh!

15:08.775 --> 15:10.508
Shh!

15:10.510 --> 15:12.610
Uh... did I...?

15:12.612 --> 15:14.412
No, I'm sorry, Darlene.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.415
You can try again, okay?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.350
Alright, that's it for today.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.752
Louie, Casey, get her
out of this thing please.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.157
I really apologize...

15:26.159 --> 15:27.658
Don't ever come late again.

15:28.661 --> 15:29.727
I'm sorry.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.366
Alright, let's go get your files

15:35.368 --> 15:37.668
so you can be prepared
for the next time.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.270
What was that necklace?

15:39.272 --> 15:42.039
If you read the manual,
you'd know.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.175
It's a spirit steeper,
you put it on

15:44.177 --> 15:45.609
and the last spirit
that possessed you

15:45.611 --> 15:47.111
is invited back.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.813
We record everything
on that camera there,

15:48.815 --> 15:51.048
and we chart your progress.

15:55.355 --> 15:59.023
If you can remove
the spirit steeper on your own,

15:59.025 --> 16:00.124
while possessed,

16:00.126 --> 16:02.226
then you've
completed the training.

16:02.228 --> 16:05.329
If I have to remove it
for you, then...

16:05.331 --> 16:06.997
The therapy continues.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.866
There's also a lot of homework.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.735
You're gonna have some pretty
uncomfortable conversations

16:10.737 --> 16:12.370
with your family
and your friends.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.538
Yeah, I think
I already stumbled into those.

16:16.175 --> 16:21.078
You need to look for clues,
piece together lost memories.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.014
What is all this stuff?

16:24.016 --> 16:28.753
Old cases... files on everyone,
even before I worked here.

16:28.755 --> 16:32.323
Dates back to 1982, I think.

16:37.597 --> 16:41.365
This is your priest report on
your uninvited spiritual guest.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.535
People you hurt or injured
while you were possessed.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.337
You're gonna need to make
amends with them.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.072
Does it say why it chose me?

16:48.074 --> 16:50.374
No, it doesn't.

16:50.376 --> 16:53.711
The goal is not
to determine why.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.013
Is it possible, my demon...

16:56.015 --> 16:58.215
We don't use the "d" word here.

16:58.217 --> 17:00.418
Did you even look at the manual?

17:00.420 --> 17:03.554
I'm sorry. Yeah,
I flipped through it.

17:03.556 --> 17:08.592
Is it possible it's my fault?

17:08.594 --> 17:09.859
Well, it could be random,

17:09.862 --> 17:12.530
or karmic,
or induced by a third party.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.266
But more important
than placing blame

17:15.268 --> 17:17.801
is preventing it
from happening again.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.271
I've been seeing...

17:22.608 --> 17:27.377
Crazy visions.
Like waking nightmares.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.946
That's the spirit.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.187
It's trying to come back.

17:47.967 --> 17:52.837
"Naphula is a
six-foot-one-inch tall succubus,"

17:52.839 --> 17:56.373
"a feline hybrid
of a dragon, bird and goat."

17:59.579 --> 18:02.680
"He is depicted carrying a drum.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.716
The sound of the drums
signals his approach."

18:14.861 --> 18:16.527
That's her.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.662
Hi.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.265
I know who you are.

18:23.135 --> 18:24.502
Demon! No.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.837
Be gone! Go away!

18:26.839 --> 18:29.440
I'm better now! Be gone!

18:31.377 --> 18:33.210
I-I'm... I'm
happy to take the time,

18:33.212 --> 18:35.513
just keep your distance.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.148
The cops brought you in
for a psych evaluation.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.150
They said
they wanted you sedated.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.220
You'd been jumping over cars
causing accidents.

18:43.222 --> 18:46.524
But when I went to administer
the benzodiazepine,

18:46.526 --> 18:49.393
you broke though the cuffs
on the stretcher,

18:49.395 --> 18:51.462
and you chewed
right through my finger.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.732
Specifically?

18:56.369 --> 18:57.868
You shoved your tongue
down my throat

18:57.870 --> 19:00.504
and smashed my head
into the ATM three times.

19:00.506 --> 19:01.906
I'm sorry.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.744
Did I...

19:06.746 --> 19:08.879
Say anything?

19:08.881 --> 19:11.882
Yeah, you did actually.

19:11.884 --> 19:15.819
"<i> Ad miseriam esurio</i> ."
Over and over.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.054
I looked it up

19:17.056 --> 19:17.821
because it was ringing
through my head for days,

19:17.823 --> 19:19.657
driving me crazy.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.058
It's Latin.

19:21.060 --> 19:24.295
It means "for your misery,
I hunger."

19:25.364 --> 19:27.097
<i>Hey Carl, it's me...</i>

19:27.099 --> 19:28.699
<i>Again.</i>

19:28.701 --> 19:32.870
<i>Uh, I guess you're upset at me.</i>

19:32.872 --> 19:36.240
I am so, so sorry...

19:36.242 --> 19:37.241
<i>Hello.</i>

19:37.243 --> 19:40.377
Hey. Hi.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.779
You're there.

19:41.781 --> 19:46.116
<i>Yeah.
Look, please stop calling me.</i>

19:46.118 --> 19:48.352
Wait Carl, I'm better now.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.354
Can we please just meet
and talk about this?

19:50.356 --> 19:51.522
<i>No. I don't,</i>

19:51.524 --> 19:53.357
<i>I don't want to see you anymore.</i>

19:53.359 --> 19:55.859
<i>Look, we broke up.</i>

19:55.861 --> 19:57.528
But...

19:57.530 --> 19:59.463
<i>I-I get that you
don't remember, but it's over.</i>

20:02.101 --> 20:05.703
Ava, honestly, forget about him.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.039
If a demon isn't an excuse
for a little indiscretion,

20:09.041 --> 20:10.441
I don't know what is.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.777
Ooh.
"Say goodbye to split ends."

20:13.779 --> 20:17.047
What if my possession
wasn't an excuse, though.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.283
What if it's bad Karma,
like mom said.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.918
Mom has her own issues.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.320
They have nothing to do
with you.

20:23.322 --> 20:24.788
She just thinks they do.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.961
Hi everybody, my name's Ava.

20:30.963 --> 20:34.898
My uninvited spiritual guest
possessed me for 28 days

20:34.900 --> 20:37.401
and was exorcised on Tuesday.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.902
Tell us its name.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.007
Naphula, the anointed.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.112
In the grand scheme
of the 36 legions of hell,

20:48.114 --> 20:53.450
he's sort of the, uh,
entitled, arrogant rich kid.

20:53.452 --> 20:58.656
He likes to come up
for joyrides in human bodies.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.091
And he carries a drum...

21:02.361 --> 21:04.862
That he beats as he approaches.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.464
Mine was drekavac, the cursed.

21:07.466 --> 21:09.533
He's from the souls
of murdered babies.

21:09.535 --> 21:12.803
My evil spirit's orivus,
he made me eat my dog.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.873
Guys...
Let's let Ava talk, okay?

21:17.710 --> 21:20.444
I found this in my couch,

21:20.446 --> 21:23.280
and I don't know
how it go there.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.582
Oh, that could be
a good place to start.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.688
"To Conrad.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.690
For thirty years
of wedded bliss."

21:32.692 --> 21:35.359
Do you know who this Conrad is?

21:35.361 --> 21:36.860
No.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.029
This is a cheri Cher watch.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.331
There's a store in Soho.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.535
Abaddon, the annihilator
shoplifted from there.

21:44.537 --> 21:47.604
That's my demon's name.
The "d" word, Hazel.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.474
Such a pointless rule.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.875
Hazel!

21:51.877 --> 21:54.311
Don't make this any more
serious than it already is.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.247
Anything else?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.586
There was a...

22:02.588 --> 22:06.323
A little blood on the floor
in my living room.

22:06.325 --> 22:10.027
But I don't know
whose blood it is.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.528
Probably your own.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.230
It could be animal blood.

22:13.232 --> 22:14.531
Did you have any pets?

22:14.533 --> 22:17.701
Louie, haven't we
talked about this?

22:17.703 --> 22:20.304
Barnabas is in
a better place now.

22:30.382 --> 22:31.515
Hey, new girl.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.785
Got the hots for Tony yet?

22:34.787 --> 22:37.688
Mmm, not really my type.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.090
What's going on
between you and him?

22:40.092 --> 22:41.225
He caught me sneaking in there

22:41.227 --> 22:44.061
a couple weeks ago
so I'm on thin ice.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.462
Or whatever.

22:45.464 --> 22:46.697
You broke into the church?

22:46.699 --> 22:49.867
Yeah,
I want that amulet he's got.

22:49.869 --> 22:50.968
The spirit steeper?

22:50.970 --> 22:54.538
But why? Is it worth a lot?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.140
Probably.

22:56.142 --> 22:58.375
I would use it
to get my demon back.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.945
Why would you wanna do that?

23:01.947 --> 23:04.448
There was
a connection between us.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.884
And I think
it was special for him too.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.118
I was the first girl.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.721
Abaddon, the annihilator
had ever been inside of.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.990
In that way.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.292
And he's got this sexy scar
on the side of his cheek

23:15.294 --> 23:17.561
from when an archangel
slashed him.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.899
Anyway, I gotta go.
I'll see you at the next one.

23:21.901 --> 23:22.966
Alright.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.828
You didn't have to help.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.663
Don't you have
a giant wedding to plan?

23:52.665 --> 23:55.632
Oh, uh, we pushed back the date.

23:55.634 --> 23:56.834
Not because of
what happened to you,

23:56.836 --> 23:59.403
we just needed more time.

24:01.373 --> 24:02.506
Look what I got...

24:02.508 --> 24:04.508
To replace
the one grandpa gave me.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.444
It's exactly the same, right?

24:08.514 --> 24:11.849
Oh. It got destroyed?

24:11.851 --> 24:13.617
No, it went missing.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.620
I remember
not being able to find it.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.456
It's one of
the last memories I had...

24:19.458 --> 24:21.191
Before the demon.

24:23.829 --> 24:24.895
Ava?

24:26.065 --> 24:27.564
You okay?

24:29.969 --> 24:30.968
What's wrong?

24:30.970 --> 24:32.703
I'm okay.

24:32.705 --> 24:33.770
I'm okay.

24:35.708 --> 24:36.907
Whoa, whoa!

24:36.909 --> 24:40.811
Okay, okay, alright.
I got her, I got her.

24:40.813 --> 24:41.812
Okay.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.046
Let's get her in your bed.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.055
<i>Why are you
acting like this is your fault?</i>

24:52.057 --> 24:56.393
<i>She's not your responsibility.</i>

24:56.395 --> 25:00.197
<i>It's just that
things are different now.</i>

25:00.199 --> 25:02.199
<i>Exactly.
And if we're not careful,</i>

25:02.201 --> 25:04.334
<i>she's going to find out
what happened.</i>

25:14.280 --> 25:15.545
<i>You know, I gotta say,</i>

25:15.547 --> 25:17.581
<i>I'm with mom and dad
on this one.</i>

25:18.717 --> 25:20.517
<i>She's not fit
to take care of herself.</i>

25:20.519 --> 25:22.085
<i>She needs to go away
for a while,</i>

25:22.087 --> 25:23.620
<i>get some proper care.</i>

25:23.622 --> 25:25.789
<i>You need to stop
calling them mom and dad.</i>

25:25.791 --> 25:28.425
I'm part of the family now.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.496
Just... We're not married yet.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.300
Well, we might as well be,
after what I did.

25:47.046 --> 25:50.547
Hey, Ava. How ya feeling?

25:50.549 --> 25:52.649
A little better, thanks.

25:52.651 --> 25:55.052
These came for you
while you were asleep.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.988
Maybe you've got
a secret admirer.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.758
They're from my boss.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.061
A bunch of the bands
I represent signed it.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.929
They want me to come back.

26:05.931 --> 26:08.799
See? Things are gonna
get back to normal in no time.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.039
Where's Hank?

26:19.511 --> 26:21.078
Someone needs to
check on the girls backstage,

26:21.080 --> 26:22.579
I'll be back in a minute.

26:24.516 --> 26:27.017
Ava, no way!

26:27.019 --> 26:28.018
You're looking good.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.019
Thanks.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.020
How's it been going?

26:30.022 --> 26:31.021
It's going good.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.123
Apparently,
you've got a new single.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.524
<i>Duke, we're ready!</i>

26:36.862 --> 26:37.928
Go see.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.902
<i>La, la, la, la, la...</i>

27:55.374 --> 27:57.074
<i>La, la, la, la, la...</i>

27:57.076 --> 27:58.775
Ava, Ava.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.480
Ava.

28:05.584 --> 28:06.716
Jesus, Ava,

28:06.718 --> 28:09.286
I'm-I'm sorry if the song
upset you, but...

28:09.288 --> 28:12.355
You're not really
releasing that, are you?

28:12.357 --> 28:13.423
It's clearly a hit.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.893
It's not funny.
It really happened.

28:16.895 --> 28:19.362
Maybe the lyrics are a metaphor.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.131
Yeah, it's like poetic license.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.133
Shut up, Hank.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.602
He looks like a sex offender
in that outfit.

28:29.308 --> 28:30.874
You know what, little Dukie,

28:30.876 --> 28:33.710
I found you, I signed you,

28:33.712 --> 28:35.712
and I decide what sounds
like a single.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.214
And it's not this.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.615
Maybe it's not time
for you to come back

28:38.617 --> 28:40.951
and start making decisions
just yet.

28:47.793 --> 28:50.127
Thanks for the
get-well-soon card, assholes.

28:59.004 --> 29:00.604
Hi, I found a cheri Cher watch

29:00.606 --> 29:02.572
I'd like to return to the owner.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.008
There's an inscription on it.

29:05.010 --> 29:07.144
It says, um, "to Conrad."

29:07.146 --> 29:09.513
Thirty years of wedded bliss."

29:11.583 --> 29:12.682
Okay.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.540
Hi, I'm supposed to
meet with Ben.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.008
Ben just stepped in the back
for a moment.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.075
He'll be right out.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.245
Have I been here before?

29:44.550 --> 29:46.082
I don't know.

29:47.486 --> 29:52.122
I'm sorry, um, perhaps you'd
like to join our mailing list.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.430
You sure you don't recognize me?

30:02.167 --> 30:03.633
Should I?

30:03.635 --> 30:04.634
No, no, no.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.769
Not if you don't.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.650
Ava. Yes. Ben?

30:20.652 --> 30:22.219
Thank you for
going through all the trouble

30:22.221 --> 30:25.488
with calling the store
and coming here.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.724
It's a damn good watch.

30:27.726 --> 30:29.893
Where did you find it?

30:29.895 --> 30:32.862
On the street outside
of my building.

30:32.864 --> 30:34.998
So you've never met my father?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.166
Your father?

30:36.168 --> 30:37.434
Conrad.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.568
Oh.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.437
This was a gift
from my mother to him.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.906
She passed away a few years ago.

30:42.908 --> 30:44.708
That's why
the store contacted me.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.243
Well I'd really
like to meet Conrad,

30:46.245 --> 30:47.744
if at all possible.

30:47.746 --> 30:50.513
He's away on business, a lot.

30:50.515 --> 30:51.615
What kind of business?

30:52.718 --> 30:55.185
Art, among other things.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.120
He owns this gallery with me.

31:10.435 --> 31:12.535
I-I-I should really get going.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.437
It was really nice to meet you.

31:31.923 --> 31:33.990
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

31:33.992 --> 31:35.458
Nothing anymore.

31:35.460 --> 31:36.726
I was fired.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.961
Ooh.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.665
Are you a bad girl?

31:42.934 --> 31:45.168
You need to learn to be
a little more cutthroat.

31:46.104 --> 31:48.305
Well, when I was possessed,
I cut some throats.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.008
Snarl.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.378
Stretch out your facial muscles.

31:57.349 --> 32:00.617
Remember, when you
face the dark spirits,

32:00.619 --> 32:03.019
they must also face you.

32:03.021 --> 32:04.521
<i>She is a riot, man.</i>

32:04.523 --> 32:08.425
She is a real riot.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.526
Told you.

32:09.528 --> 32:10.627
No, really.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.529
Ava, please not here.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.964
I was possessed.

32:14.966 --> 32:17.701
You all have a target
on your back, people.

32:17.703 --> 32:21.004
Once you've been possessed,
you are ten times more likely

32:21.006 --> 32:24.174
to be repossessed, revisited.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.242
So let's not make it
easy for 'em, shall we.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.681
More angry. Do not let them
take you over.

32:31.683 --> 32:35.518
It's your body, claim
possession, claim ownership,

32:35.520 --> 32:38.455
claim the right
to your existence.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.123
Hazel, hit the goddamn thing!

32:40.125 --> 32:42.192
Come on, harder! Two hands, go.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.293
Two hands.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.195
Come on, Hazel. Come on, Hazel!

32:45.197 --> 32:47.564
That was embarrassing.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.733
Fastest date in history.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.602
Well, if he can't accept
my inner demons, then fuck him.

32:54.239 --> 32:55.305
Totally.

33:32.577 --> 33:33.576
Hi, Ava.

33:33.578 --> 33:35.412
Hi, mom.
I told you to call first.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.614
You're not
supposed to be drinking.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.516
Haven't you heard,
I can handle my spirits.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.451
Oh, you think it's funny?

33:42.354 --> 33:43.853
What are you,
some kind of expert.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.222
How can you possibly know
what this has been like for me?

33:46.224 --> 33:48.191
I just know, okay?

33:48.193 --> 33:51.027
I've had my share
of difficulties.

33:51.029 --> 33:56.032
Zinc, one a day, with meals.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.301
Here's your calcium.

33:58.303 --> 34:01.271
Something happened here that
you guys aren't telling me.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.374
I found blood
under the rug over there.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.876
Someone tried to cover it up.

34:06.878 --> 34:10.213
Well, you hurt yourself,
we cleaned it up. So?

34:10.215 --> 34:12.382
Part of my therapy is I have to
confront all of the bad things

34:12.384 --> 34:13.750
that I did head on.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.820
I hope you're not spilling
your guts to those hippies.

34:18.255 --> 34:19.621
Those hippies
are the only people

34:19.623 --> 34:21.357
helping me recover.

34:22.427 --> 34:26.129
Trust me when I say

34:26.130 --> 34:29.232
you don't want to know any more.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.900
Just leave it alone.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.841
Ginseng...

34:41.079 --> 34:44.179
Hey Tony,
you said the possession

34:44.181 --> 34:47.516
could be induced
by a third party.

34:47.518 --> 34:48.585
How?

34:49.521 --> 34:51.454
What did you mean by that?

34:51.456 --> 34:53.989
By invoking runic
or psychokinetic energy.

34:53.992 --> 34:56.659
Maleficium or Vamachara.

34:56.661 --> 34:57.760
What's that?

34:58.797 --> 34:59.996
Black magic.

35:02.634 --> 35:06.469
Truth is we don't know
exactly how it works.

35:06.471 --> 35:09.005
It's like breaking and entering.

35:09.007 --> 35:12.242
Spectral doorways open,
the barrier's weakened.

35:14.012 --> 35:15.745
Spirit slips in.

35:17.315 --> 35:18.314
The whole point
of what we do here

35:18.316 --> 35:21.117
is to make you possession-proof.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.519
Lay the right
foundational bricks

35:22.521 --> 35:27.257
so that no one or no thing
can ever get in again.

35:58.256 --> 35:59.656
Remember me, doll-face?

35:59.658 --> 36:02.358
You chewed my ear
like a little rat.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.660
Well you danced
with the wrong matador,

36:03.662 --> 36:06.596
'cause I will carve out
your fuckin' eyes.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.364
Now I want my money.

36:08.366 --> 36:09.532
Plus interest.

36:09.534 --> 36:12.502
Plus damages. Plus fuck you.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.003
I don't remember.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.439
I'm sorry.
Oh, you don't remember?

36:16.441 --> 36:20.510
You don't remember Noelle
with your titties in her face?

36:20.512 --> 36:23.513
Now I don't care
if you're a girl or a boy

36:23.515 --> 36:26.849
or a pig or a dog
or a monkey vegetarian,

36:26.851 --> 36:28.384
or an episcopalian.

36:28.386 --> 36:31.788
If you're with one of Escobar's
girls, you gotta pay...

36:34.059 --> 36:36.092
One way or another.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.862
Now open up your wallet
and show me your money.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.433
And your jewelry too.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.538
Ow, ow, ow.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.321
Come on, Darlene, you can do it.

37:05.323 --> 37:07.090
I mean, what are the odds

37:07.092 --> 37:09.692
that two twin sisters
both get possessed.

37:13.131 --> 37:15.431
Maybe it's genetic?
I heard that can happen.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.468
What are you doing Saturday?

37:18.470 --> 37:19.836
Do you wanna hang out?

37:19.838 --> 37:21.738
Sure.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.739
Fight it.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.173
Fight this spirit, fight it.

37:28.513 --> 37:29.579
C'mon.

37:31.316 --> 37:34.017
C'mon. Fight it. You can do it.

37:34.019 --> 37:35.585
I know you can do it!

37:41.860 --> 37:42.859
That a girl!

37:47.499 --> 37:48.531
You did it.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.266
Give me this.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.237
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

37:59.511 --> 38:02.311
Cut my hand
as a warning, I guess.

38:02.313 --> 38:03.813
And ran off.

38:03.815 --> 38:07.016
Sounds like he was
some sort of pimp or something,

38:07.018 --> 38:08.518
which explains why he's not
on the list of people

38:08.520 --> 38:10.953
pressing charges against you.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.356
Did he tell you the name
of the woman?

38:13.358 --> 38:15.825
Yeah, Noelle.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.627
Maybe she's a prostitute.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.729
You're gonna have to
talk to Noelle.

38:19.731 --> 38:21.631
You're gonna have to
meet her in person.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.700
How am I supposed to find her?

38:23.702 --> 38:26.803
There's nothing easy
about this process, Ava.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.171
Some of these people have been
coming here for years

38:28.173 --> 38:30.606
with little or no progress.

38:32.043 --> 38:34.577
You know what Hazel would say?

38:35.480 --> 38:36.846
You keep us chasing the past,

38:36.848 --> 38:38.181
so that you can
keep this place filled up,

38:38.183 --> 38:39.515
so you've got a job.

38:39.517 --> 38:42.018
That sound's like
something Hazel would say.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.753
What do you say?

38:43.755 --> 38:44.987
I'd say...

38:44.989 --> 38:47.190
Did I really do something
when I was possessed

38:47.192 --> 38:49.759
that your average scumbag
hasn't already done?

38:51.596 --> 38:54.197
That's a pretty
bleak outlook, Ava.

38:54.199 --> 38:55.832
You may want to
change your perspective.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.619
I got you a little present.

39:18.423 --> 39:22.024
Oh, that's nice.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.494
Thanks for the Jade elephant.
That's...

39:27.031 --> 39:28.698
J.J...

39:28.700 --> 39:29.866
What do you,
want do you want from me?

39:29.868 --> 39:31.234
What do you, what do you...

39:31.236 --> 39:33.302
What do you want me to do?

39:33.304 --> 39:34.470
You got a guy in city hall

39:34.472 --> 39:36.272
who can like track down people?

39:38.042 --> 39:39.976
Yes.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.778
How about a prostitute?

39:43.314 --> 39:45.448
Wait, a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

39:45.450 --> 39:47.784
Are you, are you trying to
get me a prostitute right now?

39:47.786 --> 39:50.286
No, it's part of my therapy.

39:51.756 --> 39:53.556
Is that two separate
thoughts there?

39:53.558 --> 39:57.326
I gotta find people
and talk to them, make amends.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.295
You want me to track down
a prostitute for you?

39:59.297 --> 40:00.663
Yes, please.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.900
I like where this is going.

40:06.504 --> 40:07.503
Hello?

40:07.505 --> 40:09.005
<i>Hi, this is Ben Branson.</i>

40:09.007 --> 40:11.007
- Oh, hi.
<i>- Could I ask you to, um,</i>

40:11.009 --> 40:13.276
<i>come out for a drink with me,
as a thank you?</i>

40:13.278 --> 40:14.977
<i>Conrad would say
that's the decent thing to do</i>

40:14.979 --> 40:16.612
<i>for returning his watch.</i>

40:16.614 --> 40:18.181
Yeah, sure.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.487
<i>I thought we were
going out for a drink.</i>

40:26.858 --> 40:28.758
More fitting gift,

40:28.760 --> 40:30.860
would be letting you chose
whatever you like.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.428
Are you serious?

40:33.665 --> 40:35.198
You can take any piece you want.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.935
Unless you don't like anything.

40:50.181 --> 40:51.547
I like this one.

40:53.518 --> 40:56.219
This is one of my favorites.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.521
Leda and the swan.

40:58.523 --> 41:00.456
That's a swan?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.859
It's actually
the Greek god Zeus.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.861
He took the form of a swan

41:04.863 --> 41:08.231
in order to seduce
a woman named Leda.

41:08.233 --> 41:09.732
I thought it was an angel.

41:11.369 --> 41:13.436
Greek gods are
kind of like fallen angels.

41:16.407 --> 41:18.341
Is this Conrad?

41:18.343 --> 41:19.408
Yes.

41:22.513 --> 41:24.547
I don't think
I could work for my family.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.082
I can relate.

41:26.084 --> 41:27.917
I love that Conrad travels.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.553
Let's me run this place
the way I want.

41:30.555 --> 41:32.388
That's good...

41:32.390 --> 41:33.723
That you know what you want.

41:38.563 --> 41:42.098
Sorry, it's my lawyer calling.

41:45.203 --> 41:46.335
J.J.?

41:46.337 --> 41:47.436
<i>What's up, kiddo?</i>

41:47.438 --> 41:48.871
<i>Uh, I have a lead</i>

41:48.873 --> 41:51.741
<i>on that Noelle woman
you're looking for.</i>

41:51.743 --> 41:52.875
You have a number?

41:52.877 --> 41:54.543
<i>Uh, no, I have an address,</i>

41:54.545 --> 41:57.713
and I hear she's only there
for another hour.

41:57.715 --> 41:58.714
Tonight?

41:58.716 --> 42:00.716
Yeah, tonight. What? Come on.

42:00.718 --> 42:02.084
Oh, shit.

42:02.086 --> 42:03.519
Ben, I'm so sorry I have to go.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.921
It was nice to see you again.

42:04.923 --> 42:06.122
But...

42:40.792 --> 42:41.991
Your loss, baby.

42:41.993 --> 42:43.059
You'll be back.

42:44.996 --> 42:46.896
Take a look at that guy.

42:49.167 --> 42:50.566
Take a look at this bitch.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.635
There's that crazy bitch
that chewed up Escobar.

42:52.637 --> 42:54.570
Hey, is one of you Noelle?

43:04.515 --> 43:05.781
You remember me?

43:05.783 --> 43:07.950
How could I forget.
What do you want?

43:07.952 --> 43:09.785
You're gonna have to pay first.

43:09.787 --> 43:11.420
I'm talkin' Benjamins.

43:12.490 --> 43:14.790
Can we talk somewhere?

43:14.792 --> 43:15.858
Yeah.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.529
Welcome back to hotel Noelle.

43:22.166 --> 43:24.367
Oh, wow.

43:24.369 --> 43:25.801
This is nice.

43:25.803 --> 43:28.371
So I-I don't remember
the night we met.

43:28.373 --> 43:31.507
No, no, no, no, no.
I just wanna talk.

43:31.509 --> 43:33.509
I don't say no to money, honey,

43:33.511 --> 43:35.845
but I ain't no psychoanalyst.

43:35.847 --> 43:37.480
Listen, I'll be
out of your way in five minutes.

43:37.482 --> 43:40.783
I just need to know
what happened that night.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.319
You really
don't remember anything.

43:43.321 --> 43:46.555
No. I was possessed...

43:46.557 --> 43:48.524
By a demon.

43:48.526 --> 43:51.360
Holy fuck. Is that contagious?

43:51.362 --> 43:52.862
I don't think so.

43:52.864 --> 43:55.331
Good. 'Cause I've got enough
problems without that shit.

43:55.333 --> 43:56.866
Okay, well, I just need to know

43:56.868 --> 44:01.137
how I found you,
what I said to you.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.738
Yeah,
I was in here with some guy,

44:02.740 --> 44:04.840
and you showed up
and climbed in.

44:04.842 --> 44:06.375
You stripped down
to your underwear

44:06.377 --> 44:09.045
and next thing I know
we were all going at it.

44:09.047 --> 44:13.349
I saw you earlier, you were like
following him, I think.

44:13.351 --> 44:17.686
I figured you were his wife
or girlfriend or something.

44:17.688 --> 44:22.224
I've seen people play
all sorts of kinky games.

44:22.226 --> 44:23.692
So we knew each other?

44:23.694 --> 44:25.694
Definitely.

44:25.696 --> 44:27.730
He really liked you.

44:27.732 --> 44:30.166
His name wasn't Conrad, was it?

44:30.168 --> 44:33.869
I don't do names, baby.

44:33.871 --> 44:34.937
Okay.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.374
I'm gonna give you my number.

44:38.376 --> 44:40.443
If you can please
try to find out

44:40.445 --> 44:45.214
any more information
on the guy, call me.

44:46.217 --> 44:48.117
Oh fuck, it's Escobar!

44:48.119 --> 44:49.452
Get your little ass out here!

44:49.454 --> 44:51.854
I swear to god,
she made, she made me!

44:51.856 --> 44:53.222
Now let me get this straight.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.790
You come to my Chuck e cheese

44:54.792 --> 44:57.126
and you throw your own
goddamn pizza party?

44:57.128 --> 45:00.096
I told you Escobar's girls
are off limits to you bitch.

45:00.098 --> 45:02.098
Do you have a death wish?

45:02.100 --> 45:03.766
Now if I catch you
around here again,

45:03.768 --> 45:06.268
I will snuff out
your little light.

45:12.710 --> 45:16.245
I know how it feels, Ava.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.980
All my friends hate me now too.

45:20.451 --> 45:23.886
Except Eliza,
who I saved from a rapist.

45:23.888 --> 45:27.890
I beat the shit out of him
with supernatural strength?

45:27.892 --> 45:30.726
That's fucking awesome.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.061
Wow.

45:32.063 --> 45:34.497
I don't think mine did
anything heroic like that.

45:34.499 --> 45:38.000
Oh, yeah, and I was
way more effective at PR.

45:38.002 --> 45:39.168
I got a raise,

45:39.170 --> 45:41.337
the clients said
I was more fun to be around.

45:41.339 --> 45:43.672
I mean, eventually I got fired

45:43.674 --> 45:46.609
for ripping
my co-worker's hair out.

45:46.611 --> 45:50.279
But what if you could
control a demon?

45:50.281 --> 45:54.016
You know,
like training an animal,

45:54.018 --> 45:57.520
like how people can learn
to fly in their dreams.

45:57.522 --> 45:59.155
I guess
that would be pretty cool.

46:01.192 --> 46:02.424
Yeah.

46:04.829 --> 46:08.497
Hey, wanna do something crazy?

46:14.939 --> 46:17.806
Look, there's only three
of these stores in New York.

46:17.808 --> 46:19.842
Tony sent my photo
to all of them,

46:19.844 --> 46:22.678
so they won't sell to me.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.180
There's some
black magic website,

46:24.182 --> 46:27.116
but I hate shopping online.

46:27.118 --> 46:28.117
So, all I have to do

46:28.119 --> 46:29.552
is buy this spell for you?

46:31.122 --> 46:32.521
And perform it.

46:34.025 --> 46:36.325
I can't perform my own spell.

46:36.327 --> 46:38.260
What makes you think
I can even do that?

46:39.530 --> 46:40.796
You've been possessed before.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.765
What makes you think
I would do that?

46:44.402 --> 46:46.035
You're my friend.

46:48.906 --> 46:50.573
You do realize
that if we break Tony's rules,

46:50.575 --> 46:52.408
we could get
in a lot of trouble.

46:53.477 --> 46:56.378
Have Tony's rules
helped you at all?

46:56.380 --> 46:58.247
Have you had any results
from his therapy?

47:16.901 --> 47:18.867
- Hello.
- Hi.

47:18.869 --> 47:22.871
I-I'm here to pick up
a demonium invitabo spell.

47:22.873 --> 47:25.574
Mm-hmm. First time?

47:27.712 --> 47:29.111
Yeah.

47:29.113 --> 47:33.382
I should warn you,
it'll change you.

47:33.384 --> 47:36.018
Oh, no, I've been
possessed before.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.087
I meant invocation.

47:38.089 --> 47:39.888
The spell.

47:39.890 --> 47:44.093
Forces like these,
they leave their mark.

47:46.230 --> 47:48.530
The instructions are inside,

47:48.532 --> 47:51.867
all the ingredients for
the potion, the incantation.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.670
Do you need a ceremonial cloak,
or do you have your own?

47:57.241 --> 47:58.540
What's that?

47:58.542 --> 48:00.876
That's just the frog.

48:00.878 --> 48:03.879
It's supposed to be sedated.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.282
You need to sacrifice it.

48:06.284 --> 48:08.417
I have to sacrifice it?

48:08.419 --> 48:09.718
Oh, Jesus.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.388
I just hope there are
no more surprises.

48:12.390 --> 48:14.556
Good luck with that.

48:18.729 --> 48:21.397
Okay. So, almost done.

48:21.399 --> 48:22.765
You just have to

48:22.767 --> 48:26.602
"burn an item
that belonged to the host,"

48:26.604 --> 48:29.305
that's me, "...Since childhood"

48:29.307 --> 48:30.339
and read this...

48:30.341 --> 48:34.143
Aw, I had one of these.

48:34.145 --> 48:36.011
Are you sure you want me to...

48:36.013 --> 48:37.913
Yeah, yeah. It's worth it.

48:40.351 --> 48:41.417
Yeah, and you know,

48:41.419 --> 48:43.519
give it a couple hours,
at least,

48:43.521 --> 48:44.920
before you call the priest...

48:44.922 --> 48:47.856
So we can have a little fun.

48:47.858 --> 48:48.924
Okay.

48:51.962 --> 48:53.028
Here we go:

48:58.302 --> 49:03.505
"<i> Abyssus abyssum invocat-</i>"

49:03.507 --> 49:10.045
<i>saeternum-
Terra es, terram ibis-</i>

49:10.047 --> 49:14.717
<i>ecce quomodo moritur,</i>

49:14.719 --> 49:19.888
<i>hoc sustinate damnosa
hereditas...</i>

49:25.796 --> 49:28.197
Hazel!

49:28.199 --> 49:29.565
Are you okay?

49:34.705 --> 49:36.071
Hazel, is it working?

49:46.150 --> 49:47.249
What have I done?

49:47.251 --> 49:50.352
Oh. Oh, my god,
please don't hurt me.

49:50.354 --> 49:51.353
Please don't hurt me.

49:51.355 --> 49:53.255
Please don't hurt me, please...

49:53.257 --> 49:55.691
You're... you're really hot,
really hot.

49:55.693 --> 49:56.692
You're really hot.

49:56.694 --> 49:59.261
And... and...

49:59.263 --> 50:02.264
You're...

50:02.266 --> 50:03.832
You're really pretty.

50:07.371 --> 50:09.605
That's the spirit.

50:21.285 --> 50:22.451
Oh!

50:30.861 --> 50:32.261
Oh shit!

50:46.043 --> 50:47.109
Oh, my god, what happened?

50:47.111 --> 50:49.044
Jesus,
what the fuck is wrong with her?

50:49.046 --> 50:50.546
I think she wanted
your soda or something.

50:50.548 --> 50:52.548
Psycho bitch bit my arm.

50:52.550 --> 50:53.715
Or maybe she had rabies.

50:53.717 --> 50:54.983
Where did she go?

50:54.985 --> 50:57.553
She fucking climbed
that building over there.

51:03.060 --> 51:06.495
<i>Hi, father, it's Ava.</i>

51:06.497 --> 51:09.565
Sorry to call so late,
but a friend of mine,

51:09.567 --> 51:13.001
a girl named Hazel,
might show up on your radar.

51:13.003 --> 51:14.503
She's possessed.

51:14.505 --> 51:16.572
Uh, please call me
if you hear anything.

51:22.413 --> 51:24.246
Hey.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.116
What are you doing here?

51:28.118 --> 51:31.253
You're on our mailing list.

51:31.255 --> 51:33.355
Oh, right.

51:33.357 --> 51:34.923
You forgot this...

51:38.429 --> 51:39.862
Do you wanna come inside?

51:55.012 --> 51:58.981
Do you want to talk about why
you left in such a hurry?

51:58.983 --> 52:00.082
No.

52:03.687 --> 52:06.088
I'll just, um, leave this here.

52:09.894 --> 52:12.294
Do you want me to leave?

52:12.296 --> 52:13.362
No.

52:18.068 --> 52:21.103
What...
What happened to your head?

53:53.731 --> 53:55.030
What's wrong?

54:00.337 --> 54:02.938
<i>I didn't put you here, Alice.</i>

54:02.940 --> 54:05.007
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

54:05.009 --> 54:07.743
<i>Why won't you talk to me,
I'm your mother.</i>

54:07.745 --> 54:08.744
<i>I have nothing to talk about.</i>

54:08.746 --> 54:10.479
I have to come clean
about something.

54:12.683 --> 54:14.983
What? I, um...

54:21.191 --> 54:23.225
I lied about
where I found the watch.

54:26.797 --> 54:28.530
It was in my apartment.

54:31.969 --> 54:36.772
Conrad was here,
and you do know him.

54:40.277 --> 54:41.743
This is awkward.

54:53.390 --> 54:54.389
What?

54:54.391 --> 54:56.391
My friend's in the hospital.

55:19.249 --> 55:20.248
The church will cover the costs

55:20.250 --> 55:21.516
for any broken equipment.

55:21.518 --> 55:23.018
We have insurance for that.

55:23.020 --> 55:25.320
We're gonna take her
to a residential facility.

55:25.322 --> 55:26.988
Ava, thank you
for coming so quickly.

55:26.990 --> 55:28.924
She's been asking for you
desperately.

55:28.926 --> 55:30.358
They're about to take her away.

55:30.360 --> 55:32.027
Where? Someplace where

55:32.029 --> 55:34.596
she won't be a danger to
herself or anyone else.

55:34.598 --> 55:37.766
You should speak to her,
but... go in alone.

55:39.269 --> 55:40.736
God bless.

55:41.772 --> 55:43.238
I'll be right back.

55:55.753 --> 55:57.619
Hi, Hazel.

55:57.621 --> 56:00.088
Ava, I'm so sorry.

56:00.090 --> 56:02.524
I- I hope you're not in trouble,

56:04.928 --> 56:07.529
but it was so worth it.

56:07.531 --> 56:11.066
I mean, I remember
everything this time.

56:11.068 --> 56:14.870
Like, every little detail.
I jumped off your roof.

56:14.872 --> 56:16.705
You? You mean, Abaddon...

56:16.707 --> 56:19.574
No, it was both of us.

56:19.576 --> 56:20.609
We were one.

56:20.611 --> 56:23.044
I mean, it wasn't a battle.

56:23.046 --> 56:27.582
I wasn't fighting him
and he wasn't controlling me.

56:27.584 --> 56:31.720
I made him stronger,
and he made me stronger,

56:31.722 --> 56:35.223
and it was better
than the best heroin,

56:35.225 --> 56:36.725
the best ecstasy,

56:36.727 --> 56:38.226
better than any dick
I've ever had.

56:38.228 --> 56:39.327
Hazel, I-I don't
need to know that...

56:39.329 --> 56:40.595
Yes, you do.

56:40.597 --> 56:41.830
That's why I wanted to see you,
to tell you,

56:41.832 --> 56:44.499
because you believe me.

56:44.501 --> 56:47.169
Sure demons are dark,
but they're just our shadows.

56:47.171 --> 56:50.138
Like black matter
or like a doughnut hole,

56:50.140 --> 56:51.940
like negative space.

56:51.942 --> 56:53.275
Nothing makes you more complete

56:53.277 --> 56:56.344
than total union
with your shadow.

57:10.794 --> 57:15.530
Tony, I, uh, I really
don't feel ready for this.

57:15.532 --> 57:19.034
Nobody passes the first time.

57:19.036 --> 57:23.705
It's all just part of
the training process.

57:23.707 --> 57:25.140
When you learn how to ski,

57:25.142 --> 57:27.943
you don't expect to make it
down the black diamond trail

57:27.945 --> 57:29.344
the first try, right?

57:29.346 --> 57:32.314
So, this is gonna be
your bunny slope.

57:32.316 --> 57:33.615
I don't ski.

57:35.686 --> 57:36.852
You're gonna be fine.

57:42.192 --> 57:45.193
What, what?

57:45.195 --> 57:46.428
What have you done?

57:49.299 --> 57:51.299
You got a thaumaturgic
mark on your skin.

57:51.301 --> 57:52.500
Right on your neck.

57:52.502 --> 57:54.836
What? Shit.

57:54.838 --> 57:57.339
What does it mean?

57:57.341 --> 57:58.373
It means you've appealed

57:58.375 --> 58:00.575
to a left-handed
mode of witchery.

58:03.380 --> 58:05.881
It also means
I can't help you anymore.

58:05.883 --> 58:09.017
Oh, come on, Tony. I'm so close.

58:09.019 --> 58:12.020
These dark powers
that you're just playing with,

58:12.022 --> 58:15.557
once they mark you,
they weaken you.

58:15.559 --> 58:17.926
Any form of magic,
no matter what the intention,

58:17.928 --> 58:21.129
can invite evil inside.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.868
All the progress,
all the work we've done...

58:26.870 --> 58:28.003
It's for nothing.

58:29.773 --> 58:31.539
Wow, once a week.

58:31.541 --> 58:33.608
I don't even know
if any of this is gonna work,

58:33.610 --> 58:34.876
but let's try... Excuse me.

58:34.878 --> 58:37.712
We'll make it... What is this?

58:37.714 --> 58:39.381
Excuse me...

58:39.383 --> 58:40.916
What is this thing on my neck?

58:40.918 --> 58:42.517
You've got these things
all over you.

58:42.519 --> 58:45.720
I told you...
Some spells leave a mark.

58:45.722 --> 58:47.522
I thought you meant
metaphorically.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.524
Like, like visiting
the Grand Canyon

58:49.526 --> 58:52.193
or walking in on your dad naked.

58:52.195 --> 58:53.862
I meant the high cost

58:53.864 --> 58:57.532
that must be paid
for summoning such powers.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.868
But this was just
for a friend though.

58:59.870 --> 59:02.237
You summoned the demon.

59:02.239 --> 59:06.741
You awoke the darkness.
You have the mark.

59:06.743 --> 59:08.710
Excuse me, I'm with someone.

59:10.047 --> 59:13.381
She's crazy. She's crazy.

59:16.553 --> 59:19.721
The judge knows
you were kicked out of group.

59:19.723 --> 59:21.389
I don't see any other choice.

59:21.391 --> 59:23.758
The only alternative is jail.

59:23.760 --> 59:26.628
This is best for you, Ava.

59:26.630 --> 59:28.129
Everyone
who goes into these places

59:28.131 --> 59:29.831
comes out ever crazier.

59:29.833 --> 59:33.134
You were kicked out of demon aa.

59:33.136 --> 59:35.070
It doesn't get much crazier.

59:35.072 --> 59:37.672
It's quiet, it's tranquil...

59:37.674 --> 59:39.341
It's in the Adirondacks.

59:39.343 --> 59:41.076
It's where you should have gone
in the first place,

59:41.078 --> 59:44.179
but he wouldn't listen to me.

59:44.181 --> 59:45.480
J.J. Must have other ideas.

59:45.482 --> 59:47.148
Well, J.J.'S been let go.

59:47.150 --> 59:48.650
What? We didn't like the way

59:48.652 --> 59:50.685
he handled certain things,
so we let him go.

59:50.687 --> 59:52.754
He enabled you
to look up some prostitute,

59:52.756 --> 59:54.155
and you got attacked...

59:54.157 --> 59:55.690
He was helping me.

59:55.692 --> 59:57.425
That was part of my therapy...

59:57.427 --> 59:59.394
Well, that's some therapy.

01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:04.933
Oh, my god,
who would have thought

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:09.804
our family would be
so vulnerable to demons.

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:13.441
Honey, you have to go away.

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:30.959
Hello?

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.527
Hey, it's Noelle.

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:33.862
<i>Hey, Noelle.</i>

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.030
What'd you find out.

01:00:35.032 --> 01:00:37.332
<i>I got a name for you.</i>

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.367
Car's downstairs.
You almost packed?

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.568
<i>One of the girls took that guy</i>

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.003
<i>you were looking for</i>

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:44.672
to a room where they had to
put down a credit card.

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:45.740
What's his name?

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:47.542
Was it Conrad Branson?

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:48.543
<i>I'm not telling you anything</i>

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:50.912
until you give me more money.

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:52.881
You know where to find me.

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:54.582
Okay, okay I'll figure it out.

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.451
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:08.029
You know the prostitute?

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:10.665
The one J.J. Helped me find?

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.534
I need to see her, tonight.

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:13.601
Why?

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.205
I can't tell you.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:18.873
What?

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.109
Please, I have to see her.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.846
Please.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.081
Alright, listen.

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:28.683
I'll cover for ya.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:32.120
I'll say that you, you ran away.

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:35.857
Thanks, dad,
but I have to pay her.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:37.358
Can I borrow 200 bucks?

01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:26.574
Oh, shit.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.611
No way. No way.

01:02:29.613 --> 01:02:33.081
What the hell you do?
You killed Noelle dead.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.482
What, no.

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.284
Somebody did, bitch.

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:38.853
I've got some scripture wisdom
for your white ass.

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:41.656
An eye for an eye.
You know about that bitch?

01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:44.592
I'm gonna take it out on you.
You're gonna pay.

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.194
Escobar...

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:48.163
I've had a really bad month.

01:02:48.165 --> 01:02:50.999
You do not want to
fuck with me right now.

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:53.768
Okay. Escobar can turn
the other cheek.

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:58.239
There's no need for trouble.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.681
Are you okay?

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:08.750
Oh, my god. Ben.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.320
Oh, my god.

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:14.656
Are you following me?

01:03:14.658 --> 01:03:16.858
What? I'm trying to protect you.

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:20.361
Ava!

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:21.963
I saved your fuckin' life
back there.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.064
Why were you even there?

01:03:23.066 --> 01:03:26.868
Ava, Ava, please. Listen to me.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:29.170
When you told me that Conrad
was in your apartment,

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:31.406
I realized you're in danger.

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:37.579
He does a lot of
illegal business.

01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:41.182
Someone must have wanted you
out of the picture.

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:42.250
What?

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:51.159
Ava, he kills people,
for a living, for money.

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:55.129
Why would
someone want to kill me?

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:58.733
I don't know.

01:03:58.735 --> 01:04:01.369
But maybe if we can
figure out where he went

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:03.538
after he left your apartment
that night...

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.373
I can't, I...

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:08.042
What, you can't remember?

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:09.110
I don't know.

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:15.550
Let me protect you.

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:18.052
I don't know if you can.

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:19.654
I'm sorry.

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:49.150
Look, J.J. You're the only
person I can trust right now.

01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:51.686
Everyone's gonna think
I killed Noelle.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:55.790
If I go home,
they're gonna send me away.

01:04:58.428 --> 01:05:00.395
You did the right thing coming
here.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:05.566
It's the first smart thing
you did all day.

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:10.505
Thanks for helping me.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:13.107
You know
that your parents, uh...

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:14.342
They fired me.

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:17.078
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.181
Ugh, fucking hell.

01:05:20.183 --> 01:05:21.516
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:25.019
First things first,
you need some rest.

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:27.855
I got a spot for you, come on.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.094
God, what are you
doing here so late anyways?

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.862
Um, some of us work.

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:40.935
The couch is yours.

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:47.008
Just make yourself at home.

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:48.676
Thanks, J.J.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.611
I gotta make some phone calls.

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:53.614
Good night.

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:13.534
<i>He may present
a sacrifice of burnt offerings</i>

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.870
<i>and if the new vessel
is without blemish,</i>

01:06:15.872 --> 01:06:17.405
<i>he will accept it...</i>

01:06:20.377 --> 01:06:21.809
Reflect my bear.

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:26.814
<i>We have to tell her,</i>

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.317
<i>she has to understand why...</i>

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:50.905
The night before the exorcism...

01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:52.940
That is my bear...

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:54.442
It's you they want...

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:57.044
It always was.

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.555
Thanks, J.J.

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:09.190
I'm here to help. What?

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:12.026
What the hell
were you thinking, running away?

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.428
Are you alright?

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:15.763
Someone's trying to kill me.

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:17.398
She's clearly delirious.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.033
I mean, we better call Zephyr

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:22.203
and have them send
some orderlies over to help us.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:23.404
It might look bad

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:26.040
dragging her out of here
like a mental patient.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.675
I can drive her myself.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.382
I'll make sure she gets
to Zephyr place tonight.

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:07.582
Where are we going?

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.887
What is this,
what are you doing?

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:16.756
Roger. Hello?

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.868
It's just you and me now.

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.502
Uh...

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:29.871
Hey, hey.

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:31.606
Ugh, no.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:38.645
It was you.

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:40.281
You're the guy with Noelle.

01:08:41.518 --> 01:08:43.484
So good.

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:45.786
Oh, my god, we had sex!

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:48.456
Yeah. It was so intense.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:52.627
Oh, my god, get off me! Hey.

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:56.964
Hey. I have feelings for you.

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:03.136
Ha. I do.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.205
What?

01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:11.511
Yeah. It was a funny story.

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:14.649
We ran into each other
in that whore's minivan.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:19.252
Uh! I was a nervous wreck!

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:23.691
I just hated myself, a mess.

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:26.594
Then I hired Conrad
to knock you off.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:35.736
You can imagine my surprise

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:39.640
when we found you alive
and Conrad dead.

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:59.360
It was the demon.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:00.995
It saved you.

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:04.765
It saved me too.

01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:07.435
Roger...

01:10:08.471 --> 01:10:09.937
Yeah?

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:14.141
I don't feel anything for you.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.046
How can you say that...

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.417
After what I did?

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.494
And that's when I realized,

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:44.632
it's deeper than anything
I ever felt for Jillian.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.735
What we have is truly special.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:52.707
That wasn't me.

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:54.608
That was the demon

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:07.188
then how do we
get the demon back?

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:08.823
There is one way...

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.126
It's in there.

01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:08.349
There you go.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.862
This is it.

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:25.032
Put it on.

01:13:39.482 --> 01:13:40.548
Put it on!

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.394
You're so fucking hot.

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:31.799
Why do you
want me so bad, Roger?

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.335
Fuck yeah.

01:14:34.337 --> 01:14:37.438
Same as any of those
other women of the night?

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:44.378
Tell me about
the hookers, Roger.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.547
You're
so much better than they are.

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:54.889
Oh, yeah.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:07.534
Tell me what happened to Noelle.

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:13.374
Tell me, Roger, and I'll give
you everything you want.

01:15:13.376 --> 01:15:15.242
She didn't matter.

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:17.278
I fucked her.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.646
I killed her.

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:22.116
She didn't mean a thing.

01:15:23.386 --> 01:15:24.485
Take it.

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:05.919
Well, you've proved me wrong.

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:10.057
Well done.

01:17:12.895 --> 01:17:15.295
Thanks, Tony.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:18.032
What about that mark on my neck?

01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:20.000
Uh, I wouldn't
worry about that now.

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:23.804
It's just one of many scars.

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:26.040
Will I ever know why?

01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:27.674
The possession.

01:17:27.676 --> 01:17:29.309
What brought it on?

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:32.646
Ava, you just
defeated your demon.

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:35.315
Be happy.

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:40.754
We don't use the "d" word.

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.407
Maybe you should
move in with me for a bit.

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:03.777
I've got room now.

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:06.713
You know, Jillian,
I'm really sorry.

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:10.417
I guess Roger
had everyone fooled.

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:13.720
You were never
really fooled by him.

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.589
It's my fault.

01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:18.892
I invited him into our lives.

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:21.528
Finally,
it's not my fault for once.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:29.436
I'm not used to being
the one comforting you.

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:04.738
You ready to pop that?

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:16.083
I'm bill.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.651
I- I don't know
exactly why I'm here,

01:19:17.653 --> 01:19:19.186
I mean, it's been
a rough six weeks.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:20.521
It's been tough.

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:25.692
I held up a-a 7-11
in Newark and, and here I am.

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:26.927
And... And now I got a record,

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:28.829
and I don't even remember
doin' it.

01:19:28.831 --> 01:19:30.297
It's weird,
it made me feel younger.

01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:33.100
It made me feel younger,
and I miss this little fucker.

01:19:39.842 --> 01:19:42.176
Hey, Ava.

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:43.777
Good job today.

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:45.946
I'll, uh, see you tomorrow.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:48.782
Bye, captain. I'll lock up.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:24.952
Fucking hell.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:51.044
<i>This thing that managed
to get inside of you</i>

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:53.780
<i>should be a real wake-up call.</i>

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:55.215
<i>Mom has her own issues.</i>

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:57.451
<i>They have nothing
to do with you.</i>

01:20:57.453 --> 01:20:58.785
<i>She just thinks they do.</i>

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:04.057
<i>Trust me,
you don't wanna know any more.</i>

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:05.525
<i>Just leave it alone.</i>

01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:11.365
<i>How can you possibly know
what this has been like for me?</i>

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:13.000
<i>I just know.</i>

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.439
<i>Who would have thought</i>

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:23.210
<i>our family would be
so vulnerable to demons.</i>

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:24.378
<i>Maybe it's genetic?</i>

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.479
<i>I heard that could happen.</i>

01:21:25.481 --> 01:21:26.747
<i>Look what I got.</i>

01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:28.448
<i>To replace the one
grandpa gave me.</i>

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:30.751
<i>Any form of magic,
no matter what the intention,</i>

01:21:30.753 --> 01:21:33.387
<i>can invite evil inside.</i>

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:36.056
<i>You summoned the demon,
you woke the darkness,</i>

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:37.791
<i>you have the mark.</i>
