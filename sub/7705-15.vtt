WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:09.008
- Watch out for that table.
- Uh-huh, I see it.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.709
Gee, I don't know how
your mother is gonna get

00:10.711 --> 00:13.445
all this stuff in that little,
little apartment?

00:13.447 --> 00:16.215
Well, you've never seen
the inside of her handbag.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.883
Heavy?

00:17.885 --> 00:22.454
Yes, but no heavier than other
boxes you've watched us carry.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.822
Would you mind
licking this stamp?

00:23.824 --> 00:26.525
Can't you lick
that yourself?

00:26.527 --> 00:28.460
Not with chocolate
on my tongue.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.895
Where'd you get
the chocolate?

00:29.897 --> 00:31.730
It's the funniest thing.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.566
I found a whole box
in the back of your closet.

00:36.537 --> 00:40.239
I was going to give that
to Kate for Valentine's Day.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.708
Oh, Willie, that's sweet.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.644
- He ate the whole box.
- I'm sorry.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.347
You've no respect
for personal property.

00:48.349 --> 00:51.183
You walk in anytime,
you take my candy..

00:51.185 --> 00:52.918
I said I was sorry.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.221
Whining's not gonna
bring it back.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.090
Willie,
it's-it's-it's alright.

00:58.092 --> 01:02.327
Maybe he forgot the.. He did.
He forgot the second layer.

01:02.329 --> 01:04.797
Right. I only licked those.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.835
Great. Now nobody can eat them.

01:12.373 --> 01:15.574
[theme music]

01:42.403 --> 01:45.604
[music continues]

02:18.239 --> 02:19.838
Brian, give that to me.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.674
I'll put it over here with the
rest of grandma's things.

02:22.676 --> 02:26.645
Kate, am I mistaken
or is that a cat stretcher?

02:28.249 --> 02:30.649
- It's an oar.
- Or what?

02:32.286 --> 02:34.486
Mom, why does grandma
keep an old oar?

02:34.488 --> 02:38.357
Oh, well, when grandpa was
courting grandma, he took her..

02:38.359 --> 02:40.359
...canoeing down
the Missouri River.

02:40.361 --> 02:43.529
Then why would they need
a cat stretcher?

02:43.531 --> 02:48.500
ALF, why are you sending
a ham to Sally Field?

02:48.502 --> 02:51.270
It's my valentine to her.

02:51.272 --> 02:56.041
I don't think we should send
any more meats to celebrities.

02:56.043 --> 02:58.177
Anyone could send shrimp.

03:00.114 --> 03:03.882
Am I wearing a sign
that says kick me?

03:03.884 --> 03:06.185
No, but that
can be arranged.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.853
Willie, get the staple gun.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.288
Ha!

03:09.290 --> 03:11.390
I am in no mood for you.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.859
What a coincidence.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.828
- What's the matter, mom?
- I'm just furious.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.364
They haven't finished
painting my apartment yet.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.866
I can't move in until tomorrow

03:20.868 --> 03:23.068
so I'll have to stay here
for tonight.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.871
What's the good news?

03:25.873 --> 03:28.574
Send that thing
to its room.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.976
You're off my ham list, lady.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.015
Okay, you can come in now.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.018
They've put
the chicken in the yard.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.087
Mom, what-what-what
are you doing?

03:42.089 --> 03:44.923
This guy, my new neighbor,
he insisted on coming along

03:44.925 --> 03:46.925
with me to help me move things.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.728
Well, mom, he's not gonna
believe that we have a chicken.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.931
Well, fine. Tell him the truth.
We have an alien.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.335
Get in that henhouse!
Shoo! Shoo!

03:56.337 --> 03:57.836
[clucking]

04:02.076 --> 04:03.408
High fescue!

04:03.410 --> 04:05.611
I'm Willie Tanner.
Nice to meet you, High.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.279
Oh, no, that's what
your grass is.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.047
High fescue.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.350
Oh. Oh, yeah, that's the name
of the grass.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.618
We-we planted last year.

04:12.620 --> 04:16.688
I thought your name
was "High Fescue."

04:16.690 --> 04:18.557
No, no, no.
That would be silly.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.459
My name is Whizzer Deaver.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.527
[laughs]

04:22.529 --> 04:24.529
It really is.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.632
Oh. And this is
my daughter, Kate.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.899
- Hi, Kate.
- How do you do?

04:27.901 --> 04:29.768
- Her son, Brian.
- Say hi, Bri.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.970
- Hi, Whizzer.
- Hi.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.273
I hope you don't mind that I'm
helping your mother get settled.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.574
Oh, no, no, not at all.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.977
And do you mind
if I move in with her?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.112
I mind.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.080
How 'bout if I get
some of these boxes

04:42.082 --> 04:43.415
and get out of here?

04:43.417 --> 04:44.983
It was nice
meeting all of you.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.985
I hope to see you
at the wedding.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.657
Oh, mom, he is really darling.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.058
What a nice guy.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.327
Dorothy, where did
you ever find him?

04:55.329 --> 04:57.462
- Under my sink.
- Dorothy!

04:57.464 --> 04:58.997
He was fixing
my garbage disposal.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.066
I haven't been able
to shake him since.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.203
Does Bob Hope
still have teeth?

05:06.340 --> 05:08.640
ALF, forget it.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.975
You're right.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.678
A man his age
shouldn't be eating pork.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.687
And the bartender said
"I was talking to the duck."

05:21.689 --> 05:24.656
Oh, gee, Whizzer, you got
a great sense of humor.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.425
Most people don't
get that joke.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.826
Dorothy didn't.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.861
I got it. I just
didn't think it was funny.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.197
I know, and I wanted to
make it up to you.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.366
I hope you won't
think me presumptuous.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.704
Well, If that means pushy,
then yes, I do.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.273
Well, in that case,
these are for you.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.041
Oh, how lovely.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.043
Not that I wouldn't
have taken them, but I--

05:45.045 --> 05:46.945
Then I'll give them to you.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.182
Why don't we
divide them up?

05:50.184 --> 05:51.917
I'll put them in water.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.354
What's left to be moved?

05:55.356 --> 05:58.190
What? Oh.
My suitcase here

05:58.192 --> 06:00.359
and just those
things over there.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.794
Ah, whose clarinet?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.730
I used to fool around
with one of these things.

06:04.732 --> 06:08.066
Well, just don't fool around
with this one, okay?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.901
This belonged
to my husband.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.572
Hey, I can dig it.
A man's axe is sacred.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.341
"Whizzer Deaver
and the Whizztones."

06:16.343 --> 06:17.676
- 'Right.'
- Ha!

06:17.678 --> 06:20.078
You used to play in that
club on Juniper Street?

06:20.080 --> 06:23.081
- What was the name of that?
- Club Juniper.

06:23.083 --> 06:27.319
This is one of the greatest
clarinetists who ever lived.

06:27.321 --> 06:29.154
Well, I was no Steve Allen.

06:29.156 --> 06:32.357
Gee, I wish I could hear you
play sometime, Whizzer.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.925
Hey, I'll dig out my clarinet

06:33.927 --> 06:35.761
I'll bring Dorothy
over some night

06:35.763 --> 06:38.363
and we'll have
a little jam session.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.431
What night?

06:39.433 --> 06:40.932
- Tonight.
- I'm busy.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.902
Doing what, mom?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.937
Well, we have to
divide the flowers..

06:45.939 --> 06:48.006
(ALF)
'Ha!'

06:48.008 --> 06:51.176
And then we're going to
butcher the chicken!

06:59.052 --> 07:03.388
We have got to go to
a hockey game sometime.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.190
I'll look into
season tickets.

07:05.192 --> 07:09.394
Seriously, I caught the game
on the tube last night.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.062
Fantastic!

07:11.064 --> 07:13.632
Skating,
shooting the puck

07:13.634 --> 07:15.934
hitting each other
with sticks.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.136
It's just like klane ball.

07:18.138 --> 07:21.706
Except in klane ball,
there's no skating or puck.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.647
A pickle. You?

07:28.649 --> 07:29.981
No, thank you.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.652
I meant, did you do this?

07:33.654 --> 07:34.886
Yeah.

07:37.424 --> 07:41.493
Your ham came back.
Insufficient postage.

07:41.495 --> 07:44.896
How much does it cost
to mail a ham in this state?

07:44.898 --> 07:47.098
ALF, you sent it
fourth class.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.168
So? On Melmac,
we had first class

07:50.170 --> 07:54.239
second class,
fish and ham.

07:54.241 --> 07:58.009
I think we lost fish and ham
when the postage rates went up.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.913
Oh, mom, uh,
Whizzer called.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.683
Alright, Whizzerman!

08:04.685 --> 08:07.752
Hello, to most of you.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.521
I wouldn't take that, Willie.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.493
Mom, what if I had you
and Whizzer over for dinner?

08:14.495 --> 08:16.361
Very casual. Just pot luck.

08:16.363 --> 08:19.030
Honey, Mr. Deaver
is a nice guy.

08:19.032 --> 08:23.435
But I am not, repeat not
interested in a relationship.

08:23.437 --> 08:26.371
Dorothy, I'd like to say
something about this

08:26.373 --> 08:28.173
and I don't mean
to be too critical

08:28.175 --> 08:31.443
but you're saving
yourself for a corpse.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.779
- ALF!!
- Well, she is.

08:34.781 --> 08:37.048
And I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

08:37.050 --> 08:40.619
- What do you mean?
- I talked to Sparky.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.221
You talked to my husband?

08:43.223 --> 08:47.292
I guess I never mentioned
my ability to contact the dead.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.228
I think we would've
remembered that.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.864
Everyone on Melmac could do it.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.300
Sometimes we'd just
sit around after dinner

08:55.302 --> 08:59.804
and if there was nothing good
on TV, we'd chat with the dead.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.210
You never talked to Sparky.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.413
You don't believe me?
Then, I'll prove it.

09:08.415 --> 09:13.718
Sparky's favorite food was
French toast with gravy, right?

09:13.720 --> 09:17.022
- Did you tell him that?
- No.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.225
And you didn't tell me that
Sparky called her Dodo either.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.662
- Uh, Dodo?
- Yep.

09:23.664 --> 09:28.833
He always said "I hope my Dodo
finds somebody else."

09:28.835 --> 09:32.003
Oh yeah, he also thought
the funeral was very tasteful.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.441
ALF, this really
isn't very funny.

09:36.443 --> 09:41.112
Just wait a minute. I want to
know how ALF knows all this.

09:41.114 --> 09:44.215
I told you.
I talked to him.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.885
Alright. Alright.
Then prove it.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.754
- 'Oh, mom!'
- Please.

09:49.756 --> 09:53.892
- Let-let me talk to him.
- When?

09:53.894 --> 09:57.562
- Now. Tonight.
- Well, it's been a while.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.864
I mean, I can't
guarantee anything.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.967
The smog here is so thick.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.435
- Oh, oh. Excuses..
- Oh, yeah, sure.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.970
Then you wouln't be able to
I suppose.

10:04.972 --> 10:09.975
Alright!
We'll chat with the dead.

10:09.977 --> 10:13.044
Except if there's something
good on TV tonight.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.485
Are you sure this is
alright to wear to a seance?

10:20.487 --> 10:22.120
It looks fine.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.623
Maybe you should
tuck your blouse in.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.125
What difference does
it make what you wear?

10:30.330 --> 10:33.164
I guess it does
make a difference.

10:33.166 --> 10:37.102
Dorothy, they may be dead
but they're not blind.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.404
That is my scarf.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.072
And my earring.

10:41.074 --> 10:45.644
There are no possessions
in the realm of the dead.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.179
Come on, come on,
let's get this over with.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.015
Keep your shirt on.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.150
You haven't talked
to the guy in ten years.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.152
Two more minutes
won't kill you.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.355
Oh, I went
to three stores, ALF.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.191
Everybody was out
of black candles.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.861
What is this,
National Seance Day?

11:02.863 --> 11:05.030
Alright,
these will have to do.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.798
- Isn't that our goldfish bowl?
- Yeah.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.367
- Where's our goldfish?
- He's fine.

11:09.369 --> 11:13.338
Oh, by the way,
nobody flush the toilet.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.874
Our goldfish bowl
is on the table

11:15.876 --> 11:17.609
and our goldfish
is in the toilet.

11:17.611 --> 11:20.211
Obviously, you know
what you are doing.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.514
Thank you.
Alright, folks, sit down.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.518
Uh, where is Brian?

11:26.520 --> 11:27.886
[toilet flushing]

11:27.888 --> 11:31.122
Uh-oh.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.558
Small price to pay
for contacting the dead.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.961
Let's move on.
Someone wanna hit those lights?

11:36.963 --> 11:38.463
Yeah.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.133
[rattling]

11:48.241 --> 11:53.878
Incidentally, I'll be the
only one asking questions.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.415
- Why you?
- What did I just say?

11:57.417 --> 12:00.985
Now, if you'll all join hands
and close your eyes.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.923
All the way, Willie.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.092
I'm sorry.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.461
I'm going into
a trance now.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.498
[braying]

12:19.439 --> 12:20.772
[exhaling]

12:20.774 --> 12:24.109
You don't have to
make rude noises.

That's alright,
I don't mind.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.950
Come on, come on.
Get on with this.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.952
I'm nervous
enough already.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.754
We're moving on.

12:36.857 --> 12:40.658
Hello. Hello.

12:41.795 --> 12:46.197
I'm trying to reach Sparky..

12:46.199 --> 12:48.800
What was your
last name again?

12:48.802 --> 12:50.535
Halligan.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.504
Halligan.

12:53.740 --> 12:57.041
Sparky, come in.

12:57.043 --> 13:00.779
It's me, Gordon.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.681
Gordon Shumway.

13:05.652 --> 13:09.254
(Sparky)
'Gordon? Is that you?'

13:09.256 --> 13:11.322
I don't believe this.

13:12.492 --> 13:17.495
Sparky. Yo, what's
the good word?

13:17.497 --> 13:21.366
(Sparky)
'Can't complain.
Death's been good to me.'

13:22.636 --> 13:25.970
Oh, my God.
That sounds just like him.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.706
It sounds like Teddy Ruxpin.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.410
That's what dad
sounded like.

13:32.412 --> 13:38.850
Sparky, I'm sitting right here
next to the widow Halligan.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.985
(Sparky)
'My little Dodo?'

13:40.987 --> 13:43.488
Sparky? Sparky?
Is this really you?

13:43.490 --> 13:48.026
Quiet. Can we let the deceased
get a word in edgewise?

13:48.028 --> 13:52.764
Sparky, talk to Dorothy.

13:52.766 --> 13:56.034
Give us a sign.

13:56.036 --> 13:59.103
[bowling ball

14:00.774 --> 14:02.507
He left the seven.

14:03.610 --> 14:07.312
That's Sparky, then.
He always left the seven.

14:07.314 --> 14:11.316
Oh, sweetheart,
it's you, it's you.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.051
He's up there.

14:13.053 --> 14:16.054
It's you, it's you.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.555
Mom, let's not
be too hasty.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.725
I believe your
father was talking.

14:20.727 --> 14:24.896
We only have a few
seconds left, Sparky.

14:24.898 --> 14:30.635
Tell Dodo what you told me
the other day.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.673
(Sparky's)
'Dodo, if you should meet
a man you like'

14:35.675 --> 14:37.642
'well, go for it.'

14:39.246 --> 14:43.348
Oh, Sparky,
I-I-I don't know what to say.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.383
'As I was saying..'

[tape recorder rewinding]

14:48.755 --> 14:49.854

14:49.856 --> 14:52.590
Uh-uh, it means
the seance is over.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.526
Hit the lights!
Break out the refreshments!

14:55.528 --> 15:00.198
And no questions, please.
I'm still in a trance.

15:00.200 --> 15:04.669
You're going to be in a coma
if this is what I think it is.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.372
This is my new
tape recorder.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.008
- Tape recorder?
- Wait, I can explain.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.910
So can I. You're a fraud.

15:11.912 --> 15:15.680
Alright, ALF. Out with it!
And we want the truth!

15:15.682 --> 15:21.085
The truth is not all
of what you just saw is real.

15:21.087 --> 15:24.589
Oh, well,
this-this wire is real.

15:25.959 --> 15:29.727
This is a real fine hole
in our dining room table.

15:29.729 --> 15:32.397
Where was I supposed
to put the flashlight?

15:32.399 --> 15:35.566
By the way,
did that work for you?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.869
Brian, you had better
leave the room

15:37.871 --> 15:40.805
there is going to be some
swearing now.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.907
I wanna hear the swearing.

15:42.909 --> 15:45.743
- We're not going to swear.
- I am!

15:45.745 --> 15:47.812
Count me in.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.581
Come on, Brian,
I think we better go.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.318
- I'm going with you.
- Stay where you are.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.919
Just a minute,
you little creep.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.487
I would like to know something.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.123
Where did you get all this
information about my life?

15:59.125 --> 16:01.292
- Promise you won't hit me.
- Yes!

16:01.294 --> 16:03.361
Easy.
I went through your things.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.265
Well, I mean, I thought
it would make you feel better

16:07.267 --> 16:09.167
about going out
with the Whizzer.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.502
Whizzer? Whizzer?

16:11.504 --> 16:14.505
Look, I've had it
up to here with Whizzer!

16:14.507 --> 16:16.474
Just let me tell
you something, buster.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.177
I don't need any help
from you or anybody else

16:19.179 --> 16:22.113

my life, okay?

16:22.115 --> 16:23.748
Now, when one of
you has time

16:23.750 --> 16:26.117
one of you can give me
a ride to my apartment.

16:26.119 --> 16:30.822
No, mom. Wait, wait, wait!
You are in big trouble.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.258
You know, for what you paid,
you could've gotten

16:34.260 --> 16:36.027
a better tape recorder.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.395
It was on sale!

16:38.698 --> 16:42.367

What about those refreshments?

- Brilliant.

Yeah, the wife and I
are lookin' for a new place.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.206
Oh, what kind of square footage
have you got here?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.408
I don't know.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.876
Mind if I measure?

17:25.745 --> 17:29.347
Now is not really a good time.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.383
Oh. Uh, when would be
a good time then?

17:34.687 --> 17:38.089
Two years from now
when my lease is up.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.657
Good enough.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.341
Oh.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.845
What in the world..

18:04.717 --> 18:06.551
Oh, no, no!

18:06.553 --> 18:08.586
Whoa! What a rough trip.

18:08.588 --> 18:12.090
It's like being
sent "ham class."

18:12.092 --> 18:14.192
Just get out of here!

18:14.194 --> 18:15.726
Dorothy, please.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.862
I came all the way
over here to talk to you.

18:19.065 --> 18:22.900
Lucky for you, I haven't
unpacked the knives yet.

18:22.902 --> 18:27.205
Alright. I admit that the seance
was a cruel trick

18:27.207 --> 18:29.040
but I did it all for you.

18:29.042 --> 18:33.044
Oh, fine, you humiliated me
for my benefit. Thank you.

18:33.046 --> 18:36.747
No. I didn't count
on humiliation.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.483
That was sort of a bonus.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.286
I know those knives
are here somewhere.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.654
Hey, look, look.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.124
I know how you must've
felt about Sparky.

18:46.126 --> 18:49.327
It's not easy to lose
something you love.

18:49.329 --> 18:53.097
I know. I lost my whole world.

18:53.099 --> 18:58.469
But at some point, we just have
to turn the page and move on.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.406
You know something,
you're in the wrong game.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.509
You should be a shrink.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.177
Actually I'm only
three hours short

19:06.179 --> 19:08.513
of my masters in psychology.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.984
Well, don't try any
of that stuff with me!

19:14.687 --> 19:16.487
You know, I think what's
really bugging you

19:16.489 --> 19:18.656
is that I'm onto something.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.424
I think I've hit a nerve.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.594
Well, thank you very much
for the speech

19:23.596 --> 19:25.096
you can run along now.

19:25.098 --> 19:28.499
I'm sure you'll have
no problem catching a cab.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.035
[doorbell rings]

19:31.037 --> 19:32.136
I'll get that.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.972
You're busy being defensive.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.707
You get down!

- Oh!
- You'll shut up!

- No!

'Or a flashlight.'

Shh!

19:51.858 --> 19:54.392
Hi. Hi!

19:54.394 --> 19:55.560
- Hi, Dorothy.
- Hi.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.661
Happy Valentine's Day!

19:56.663 --> 19:59.897
Happy Val..
Oh, what's that?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.499
Don't worry.
It's nothing romantic.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.467
You left your knives
in the truck.

20:03.469 --> 20:07.538
Oh! Oh, what good timing.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.410
Well, I guess
I'll be going.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.645
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:14.647 --> 20:18.149
Unless you'd like to
come in for a minute.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.084
What?

20:20.086 --> 20:23.754
I just said, unless you'd like
to come in for a minute.

20:23.756 --> 20:27.258
- What do you want moved?
- Nothing, nothing.

20:27.260 --> 20:31.662
I just thought you might
want to come in for a minute.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.731
Okay, but I don't
have a stopwatch.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.400
You'll have to tell me
when my minute is up.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.269
Don't worry about it.

20:38.271 --> 20:41.272
What's this? I don't remember
bringing that one in.

20:41.274 --> 20:44.108
Oh, that. That's an old fur.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.110
A ratty old fur.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.279
I'll probably leave
it for goodwill.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.249
Or else I'll have a hat
and gloves made out of it.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.453

20:55.455 --> 20:57.121
...of a much nicer building.

I don't guess you'll
be doing any naked cooking.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.863
- I don't get it.
- What do you mean?

21:05.865 --> 21:10.201
What-what is it exactly
that you want from me?

21:10.203 --> 21:12.203
I don't want anything from you.

21:12.205 --> 21:13.971
I just like you, that's all.

21:15.708 --> 21:19.043
Look, if you ever need anything,
I'm right down the hall..

21:31.991 --> 21:34.659
Look, I just want to say
something, okay?

21:34.661 --> 21:36.260
- Shoot.
- 'Good.'

21:36.262 --> 21:40.097
I'm sorry. I'm sorry that
I've been a little distant.

21:40.099 --> 21:43.734
Abrasive.
Distant, I meant distant.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.002
No, abrasive. You're right.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.671
- I was abrasive.
- Abrasive, yeah.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.839
See, it's just that..

21:48.841 --> 21:50.741

letting go, you understand?

21:50.743 --> 21:51.976

21:51.978 --> 21:54.512
My husband was my whole life.

21:54.514 --> 21:57.682
And I'm, uh, I'm beginning
to realize that..

21:57.684 --> 22:00.284
...it's getting
to be the time

22:00.286 --> 22:02.353
where I should
turn the page..

22:03.790 --> 22:05.823
Well, I'm a pretty good
page turner

22:05.825 --> 22:07.658
if you ever need any help.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.697
I just don't know
where to start. I..

22:12.699 --> 22:14.031
Well, we could eat.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.802
All I have unpacked
is soy sauce.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.970
Great! I'll get the glasses.

22:19.972 --> 22:23.274
Or we could go
to a restaurant.

22:23.276 --> 22:26.043
Yeah, that's good, that's good.
We could do that.

22:30.983 --> 22:37.288
Listen, I really don't think I
have much use for this anymore.

22:37.290 --> 22:39.323
Would you like me
to sell it for you?

22:39.325 --> 22:44.362
No. No, I was hoping maybe
you'd play it for me sometime.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.098
I'd love to.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.137
Goodbye, and thanks.

to an empty room.

23:10.757 --> 23:14.258
Well, that's great, mom.
Congratulations.

23:14.260 --> 23:17.194
Okay, I will.
We'll see you soon then.

Bye-bye.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.033
No kidding.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.435
He took her to
the club Lucerne.

23:24.437 --> 23:25.669
Now, they're out bowling.

23:25.671 --> 23:26.871
That's terrific.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.939
I wonder what made her
change her mind?

23:28.941 --> 23:30.508
- ALF.
- ALF?

23:30.510 --> 23:31.776
I don't get it, either.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.011
All she said was,
"Tell ALF, thanks."

23:34.013 --> 23:36.447
You know, I haven't
seen him around

23:36.449 --> 23:38.449
all night tonight, have you?

23:38.451 --> 23:39.750
