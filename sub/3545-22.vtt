00:00.208 --> 00:02.041
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:02.125 --> 00:06.792
My electronic monitoring device.
I'm on house arrest.

00:07.041 --> 00:10.667
<i>- Investigations began.</i>
- I need you to check into someone else.

00:10.750 --> 00:12.542
There's this plumber I know.

00:12.625 --> 00:16.834
<i>- Boundaries were pushed.</i>
<i>- You won't regret taking this journey.</i>

00:16.917 --> 00:19.834
<i>- And the news...</i>
- Peterson called me into his office.

00:20.083 --> 00:25.125
<i>- ...went from bad...</i>
- He's holding the promotion for Duggan.

00:25.208 --> 00:27.834
<i>- ...to worse.</i>
- I'm pregnant and it might be yours.

00:33.417 --> 00:36.166
<i>Edie Britt's favorite moment</i>
<i>of every day</i>

00:36.250 --> 00:40.041
<i>was her arrival at the construction site</i>
<i>of her new home,</i>

00:40.125 --> 00:43.542
<i>because she knew</i>
<i>what was about to happen.</i>

00:43.625 --> 00:49.000
<i>Her sudden appearance was always sure</i>
<i>to generate a few appreciative glances,</i>

00:49.083 --> 00:51.875
<i>a few lascivious looks,</i>

00:51.959 --> 00:54.834
<i>and some downright ogling.</i>

00:54.917 --> 00:59.458
<i>Sadly for Edie, the one man</i>
<i>she wanted most to notice her...</i>

01:02.125 --> 01:04.667
<i>...paid her no attention at all.</i>

01:05.792 --> 01:09.208
<i>Yes, Edie needed attention</i>
<i>to feel good about herself.</i>

01:09.291 --> 01:12.041
<i>And she was determined to get it.</i>

01:12.125 --> 01:15.709
Miss Britt,
you look extra beautiful today.

01:15.792 --> 01:17.875
Cyrus, you're so sweet.

01:17.959 --> 01:23.500
So anyhow, I was wondering if maybe

01:23.583 --> 01:27.458
I could take you out
to dinner some time.

01:27.542 --> 01:31.625
Oh, honey,
you are so far out of your league

01:31.709 --> 01:36.750
that you are playing
a completely different sport.

01:46.375 --> 01:49.583
- Hey there.
- Hey, Edie. What's up?

01:49.667 --> 01:53.959
- Nice ensemble. You busy?
- No, not really.

01:54.041 --> 01:57.333
Good. I bought fresh donuts
for my construction workers

01:57.417 --> 02:00.250
and as you can see,
I bought a few too many.

02:00.333 --> 02:02.333
So I thought you and I could...

02:03.500 --> 02:06.291
- Susan.
- Hey there, Edie.

02:06.375 --> 02:10.792
- What are you...
- Mike and I got back together.

02:10.875 --> 02:13.625
- Super.
- I knew you'd be happy for us.

02:13.709 --> 02:16.458
- So what's going on?
- Edie was about to...

02:16.542 --> 02:18.291
Free donuts. Want 'em or not?

02:18.375 --> 02:20.625
How sweet. Thanks.

02:20.709 --> 02:23.709
Why don't you go put these on a plate?

02:27.208 --> 02:29.667
And save me one with sprinkles.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.333
I cannot believe
you are still coming onto him.

02:32.417 --> 02:35.959
You said you were finished.
You thought he was a murderer.

02:36.041 --> 02:38.250
And that was your cue
to come and flirt?

02:38.333 --> 02:40.667
You wasted your time and your donuts.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.959
Not if you choke on them.

02:44.041 --> 02:47.125
- Thanks, Edie. The donuts look great.
- Pleasure.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.250
See you.

02:51.792 --> 02:55.542
I'm gonna run home and get some milk
to go with those donuts.

02:55.625 --> 02:59.625
Hey. It's a shame you've got to keep
running back and forth.

02:59.709 --> 03:02.166
I can't have donuts and juice.

03:02.250 --> 03:06.000
No, I mean, we should move in together.

03:07.166 --> 03:12.291
- Come on. What do you say?
- I say...

03:14.250 --> 03:17.458
Hold that thought.
Edie. Stop.

03:17.542 --> 03:21.375
- Hang on.
- What now?

03:21.458 --> 03:27.041
I was just rude back there,
gloating and everything. I apologize.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.875
Thank you, Susan.
That's very big of you.

03:29.959 --> 03:35.000
And on a completely unrelated topic,
Mike and I are moving in together. Bye.

03:36.500 --> 03:41.417
<i>Yes, Edie Britt needed the attention</i>
<i>of men to feel good about herself.</i>

03:43.250 --> 03:46.208
Hey, Cyrus. You have lunch plans?

03:46.291 --> 03:47.542
No.

03:47.625 --> 03:51.583
<i>And even she was amazed at how far</i>
<i>she was willing to go to get it.</i>

03:51.667 --> 03:53.917
Ellsberg Hotel, half an hour.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.834
Welcome to the majors.

04:43.333 --> 04:48.417
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Mullins</i>
<i>were finally leaving Wisteria Lane.</i>

04:48.500 --> 04:52.166
<i>In the past year, their street</i>
<i>had played host to arson,</i>

04:52.250 --> 04:54.959
<i>violence, blackmail, and murder.</i>

04:55.041 --> 04:58.834
<i>Fearing they too would be infected</i>
<i>by this moral decay,</i>

04:58.917 --> 05:02.291
<i>the Mullins felt</i>
<i>it was time to say goodbye.</i>

05:04.500 --> 05:06.917
<i>Strangely enough,</i>
<i>none of their neighbors</i>

05:07.000 --> 05:10.375
<i>seemed to notice</i>
<i>they were moving out.</i>

05:13.375 --> 05:17.792
Hey. I thought you might be thirsty.

05:17.875 --> 05:20.875
No, I'm good.

05:20.959 --> 05:23.125
So how's your roommate doing?

05:23.208 --> 05:25.125
He's hanging in there.

05:25.208 --> 05:29.291
Yeah. Well, I had to tell him some news

05:29.375 --> 05:31.875
that was a little bit upsetting for him.

05:31.959 --> 05:33.792
- No kidding.
- Excuse me?

05:33.875 --> 05:36.333
John's not good enough
to raise a child?

05:36.417 --> 05:39.291
- That kid could be his.
- It's a complicated situation.

05:39.375 --> 05:42.041
Seems pretty simple to me.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.542
You're an unfeeling bitch.

05:55.583 --> 05:58.041
Why did you hit the lawn boy?

06:00.959 --> 06:04.542
If you saw what he did to our begonias,
you'd slap him too.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.208
*WELCOME BACK DUGGAN!

06:17.625 --> 06:20.125
I can't tell from this.

06:22.417 --> 06:25.834
- Hey.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

06:25.917 --> 06:29.542
Duggan's coming back to work.
I thought I'd do something special.

06:29.625 --> 06:33.208
This has nothing to do with
you checking up on me and Annabel?

06:33.291 --> 06:34.375
What?

06:34.458 --> 06:36.875
Yesterday you brought
pictures of the kids.

06:36.959 --> 06:39.333
The day before that you brought me soup.

06:39.417 --> 06:42.500
Lynette, honey, it's got to stop.

06:43.667 --> 06:46.041
Tom.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.875
I don't care about you
working with Annabel.

06:48.959 --> 06:52.208
I told you that. This is for Duggan.
He had a heart attack.

06:52.291 --> 06:55.250
- I don't care about Annabel.
- Hey, Lynette.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.417
Speak of the devil.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.542
And I mean that.

07:09.166 --> 07:13.083
Well, you're becoming a regular fixture
around here, aren't you?

07:13.166 --> 07:16.417
Yeah. I wanted to do
something nice for Duggan.

07:16.500 --> 07:20.750
I suppose filling his bloodstream with
butter fat might be considered nice.

07:20.834 --> 07:24.375
Actually, it's fruit juice sweetened.
Can I cut you...

07:25.458 --> 07:27.166
a piece?

07:28.458 --> 07:31.917
Everyone,
I need to see you right now.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.542
OK, listen up.
I just spoke with Tim Duggan's wife.

07:35.625 --> 07:38.959
It looks like he's not going to be
returning to work after all.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.166
He had a relapse last night,

07:41.250 --> 07:43.625
which puts us in a very tight spot.

07:43.709 --> 07:47.208
But we're gonna work together
as a team and do what we need to do.

07:47.291 --> 07:49.458
Jerry, take the Hollister account,

07:49.542 --> 07:51.458
Suzanne, Paradise Springs,

07:51.542 --> 07:55.333
and, Annabel, take the lead
on the Traveler's Hotel chain.

07:55.417 --> 07:59.083
- You leave for Hawaii in three days.
- I can't do Travelers by myself.

07:59.166 --> 08:00.959
Not if they're moving into print.

08:01.041 --> 08:03.125
Well, choose someone to take with you.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.625
OK.

08:05.709 --> 08:09.417
I choose Tom.

08:15.667 --> 08:19.834
Let's see. I've beaten you at bridge
and mahjong and hearts.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.667
This is your last chance
to redeem yourself.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.208
Stop it. You're gonna make me laugh.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.959
OK, I'll be good.

08:39.417 --> 08:41.959
- Miss it, miss it, miss it.
- Bree.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.625
Come on. I'm allowed to psych you out.

08:54.625 --> 08:57.333
OK. Time's up. Take your best shot.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.959
I'm not ready yet.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.458
- Hurry up. There are people waiting.
- One more minute.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.667
- Come on, take your...
- Don't do that.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.125
George.

09:16.291 --> 09:18.750
Do you have an erection?

09:20.458 --> 09:22.417
I'm sorry.

09:23.625 --> 09:26.542
- What on earth?
- You were blowing on my ear.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.500
- I was teasing you.
- Exactly.

09:30.875 --> 09:34.375
You have got to get rid of it.
There are children present.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.667
- How?
- I don't know.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.542
- Think of something unpleasant.
- Like what?

09:39.625 --> 09:44.583
Like famine or disease or hoboes.
Whatever. Just hurry.

09:47.333 --> 09:51.000
You can't be mad about it.
It's not something men can control.

09:51.083 --> 09:54.625
I thought Rex's dislike of you
was paranoid.

09:54.709 --> 09:56.959
But you had feelings for me all along.

09:57.041 --> 09:59.417
God, this is just such a betrayal.

09:59.500 --> 10:03.792
Come on, Bree. The only thing
I'm guilty of is loving you in silence.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.750
You shouldn't be doing that.
I'm married.

10:06.834 --> 10:09.875
To a selfish liar
who betrayed you with a hooker.

10:09.959 --> 10:13.917
I told you that in confidence.
How dare you throw it back in my face?

10:14.000 --> 10:17.917
So you're ending our friendship,
after everything I've done for you?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.041
What is that supposed to mean?

10:21.333 --> 10:24.166
Nothing. It didn't mean anything.

10:25.792 --> 10:29.333
George. I do love you. As a friend.

10:29.417 --> 10:32.917
I wish you could love me the same way
back, but since you can't...

10:35.333 --> 10:37.375
goodbye.

10:44.500 --> 10:49.000
<i>Later that day, Edie Britt</i>
<i>witnessed something disturbing.</i>

10:53.041 --> 10:56.959
<i>Something she was determined</i>
<i>to put a stop to.</i>

10:57.041 --> 10:59.709
- Is Susan coming?
- She said she might be late.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.917
They've started moving
Mike's things to her house.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.792
- Already?
- Good for her.

11:05.875 --> 11:09.583
Yeah. It's nice to see Susan
so happy again.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.333
Yeah, I'm happy for Susan.

11:12.417 --> 11:15.667
But don't you think she and Mike
are moving a little fast?

11:15.750 --> 11:19.375
Two days ago she thought he was
a murderer and now they're moving in?

11:19.458 --> 11:22.041
But she found out
it was in self-defense.

11:22.125 --> 11:25.000
- They've cleared everything up.
- Good point.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.792
- Mike's a decent guy.
- Yeah, that's true.

11:27.875 --> 11:30.959
Of course,
there was the gunshot wound.

11:31.041 --> 11:34.166
That's right. Did he ever explain that?

11:34.250 --> 11:37.834
No. And I know guns,
and that wound was not self-inflicted.

11:40.625 --> 11:43.333
What about Mrs. Huber's
bloodstained jewelry?

11:43.417 --> 11:47.875
Yeah. That didn't walk
into Mike's garage by itself.

11:47.959 --> 11:49.709
Maybe this is a mistake.

11:49.792 --> 11:53.583
If there's one thing I've learned,
men can't be trusted.

11:53.667 --> 11:57.375
Hold it. Are you saying
that we should put a stop to this?

11:58.458 --> 12:02.375
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to sit her down and share our concerns.

12:03.417 --> 12:07.000
- Yeah, we could do that.
- Yeah.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.792
Edie, do you want to be a part of it?

12:09.875 --> 12:12.667
Normally I prefer not to get involved.

12:15.291 --> 12:16.834
But...

12:17.875 --> 12:21.333
if there's any way
that I could help Susan.

12:25.625 --> 12:29.583
- We need to talk.
- OK.

12:31.333 --> 12:37.041
When I was packing up your stuff in
your bedroom I found a box of bullets.

12:39.542 --> 12:45.125
Look, I feel bad about Deirdre and you
must want to find out who killed her

12:45.208 --> 12:48.041
but we can't have this stuff
hanging over us.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.250
You've got to get rid of it. All of it.

12:50.333 --> 12:53.917
The file, the map, the gun.
Especially the gun.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.959
Leave this to the police.
They're the professionals.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.834
What can I say?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.875
It seems like a reasonable request.

13:06.959 --> 13:11.875
Really? Well, that was easy.

13:13.917 --> 13:18.125
Maybe after lunch we could talk about
your leather beanbag chair.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.250
"I realize now
that I've treated you badly."

13:40.333 --> 13:42.750
"I'm the one who needs
to get help, not you."

13:42.834 --> 13:46.291
"So I have to go away.
Mrs. Tillman will look out for you."

13:46.375 --> 13:50.583
I don't consider it a burden.
You know you're welcome here.

13:50.667 --> 13:54.625
"I've left you some things.
I hope you can take comfort in them."

13:54.709 --> 13:56.333
"I got you a new mitt."

13:56.417 --> 14:00.917
"Work on your curve ball while I'm gone.
I love you. Dad."

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
I don't understand. Why wouldn't
he come see me? Why just run away?

14:05.083 --> 14:09.083
Your father's been very troubled.
I'm sure he did what he felt was best.

14:13.291 --> 14:15.625
And he wants me
to take comfort in this junk?

14:15.709 --> 14:18.208
I hate baseball.
You'd think he'd know that.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.375
Zach.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.667
*ZACH, I DIDN'T LEAVE YOU.

14:51.750 --> 14:54.750
*MEET ME AT THE BASEBALL FIELD.
THURSDAY AT MIDNIGHT. DAD.

15:03.709 --> 15:05.959
- Susan's coming.
- OK.

15:06.041 --> 15:09.333
OK, guys.
Interventions are never pretty.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.750
Stay strong
'cause she's probably gonna cry.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.083
<i>Bonjour.</i>

15:26.875 --> 15:31.792
Hi. I didn't know that the cooking
lesson was gonna be a group activity.

15:31.875 --> 15:34.542
Well, the more the merrier, right?

15:34.625 --> 15:36.875
As long as no one makes fun
of my crepes.

15:40.792 --> 15:44.417
How come I'm the only one
wearing an apron?

15:44.500 --> 15:46.542
It seems like we're ganging up on you

15:46.625 --> 15:52.542
but you were moving so fast we thought
a sort of intervention was necessary.

15:53.583 --> 15:57.709
I know it's tough to hear.
None of us wanted to do this.

16:06.417 --> 16:11.375
I appreciate what you guys
are trying to do. I really do.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.750
I'm not gonna change my mind.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.125
In my life, I've been hurt a lot.

16:19.041 --> 16:22.208
Karl and...

16:23.375 --> 16:25.959
Well, it's just taught me to be cynical

16:26.041 --> 16:29.500
and expect the absolute worst
from people.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.583
I don't want to live like that any more,

16:33.667 --> 16:36.208
and when Mike asked me
to move in with him,

16:36.291 --> 16:41.208
I was just happy, you know,
just ridiculously happy.

16:41.291 --> 16:45.417
I still am.
And I want to go with that feeling.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.750
I love him and... I love him.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.875
So I'm gonna expect the best from Mike

16:51.959 --> 16:54.625
and I know that he is gonna
deliver that in return.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.625
- OK?
- Honey.

17:04.208 --> 17:07.875
This is the worst intervention
I have ever been to.

17:15.875 --> 17:19.959
This is fun.
It's forever since we had lunch.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.542
Well, as happy as I am to see you,
I actually have an agenda.

17:25.625 --> 17:29.583
I ran into someone last week
who said you guys are looking to hire.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.917
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.083
Are you thinking of coming back?
Because say the word...

17:35.166 --> 17:38.875
No, not me.
I was actually thinking more about Tom.

17:38.959 --> 17:41.333
Tom.

17:41.417 --> 17:44.792
Yeah, he's been thinking about
making a move for a while.

17:44.875 --> 17:48.000
He feels like he's done
everything he can where he is now.

17:49.917 --> 17:53.375
Well, Tom's certainly solid.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.875
He's more than solid.
Tom's ideas are spectacular.

17:57.959 --> 18:03.250
He's passionate about his work. His
visual instincts are off the chart.

18:03.333 --> 18:07.875
- Is he as good as you?
- He's apples, I'm oranges.

18:07.959 --> 18:10.291
We excel in different areas.

18:10.375 --> 18:13.083
Trust me, you should give Tom a look.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.208
I don't need apples.

18:15.291 --> 18:17.709
I need someone like you.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.375
Cutthroat. Ruthless.

18:20.458 --> 18:25.041
Geez, Nat. You make me sound like
some kind of shark.

18:26.542 --> 18:28.625
OK.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.792
You know, actually

18:32.875 --> 18:35.583
If that's the kind of exec
you're looking for...

18:35.667 --> 18:37.792
You got a shark for me?

18:37.875 --> 18:41.166
Yes. A very pretty shark.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.542
So here's what I'm thinking.

19:48.625 --> 19:53.250
I'm gonna see if Dr. Morrison at the
Lipstone Clinic can come in and consult.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.959
You want to bring someone else in?

19:56.041 --> 19:59.709
Your body isn't responding
to the medication the way it should.

19:59.792 --> 20:02.792
The tests we've run
have all come back negative so I...

20:04.250 --> 20:07.500
I just want to be on the safe side.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.208
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.166
I don't know why

20:23.250 --> 20:27.166
but I have this overwhelming feeling
that you're gonna be just fine.

20:28.083 --> 20:31.375
Lee Craig has the biggest ego
of any doctor I know.

20:31.458 --> 20:35.625
If he wants to consult with someone,
that means he's stumped.

20:36.792 --> 20:39.417
- Which means I'm screwed.
- Don't say that.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.959
Damn it, Bree, do you understand
what's going on here?

20:43.041 --> 20:45.625
I could die.

20:49.917 --> 20:53.083
- So could I.
- What?

20:53.166 --> 20:56.333
I could walk across the street tomorrow
and be hit by a car.

21:01.792 --> 21:04.333
What in God's name is your point?

21:05.333 --> 21:10.250
All I'm saying
is that we're both gonna die eventually.

21:10.333 --> 21:14.750
In the time that we have left,
whether it's two days or two decades,

21:14.834 --> 21:17.125
I think we should
be nice to each other.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.542
You're right.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.333
Miss Tillman.

21:31.417 --> 21:34.959
Paul Young's been missing for a couple
of days. Have you seen him?

21:35.041 --> 21:37.458
Why ask me?

21:37.542 --> 21:42.125
I saw him leave a box on your doorstep.
And I've seen Zach over here.

21:42.208 --> 21:45.250
If I did know where Mr. Young was,
why would I tell you?

21:47.583 --> 21:52.500
Look, the police think I killed
your sister and I'm sure you do too.

21:52.583 --> 21:54.291
But I had nothing to do with it.

21:54.375 --> 21:57.375
And you think Paul Young did.

21:58.458 --> 22:00.458
No, that's not what I was saying.

22:00.542 --> 22:03.458
You gotta admit, it's a neat theory.

22:04.667 --> 22:07.083
Care for a snack?

22:09.750 --> 22:11.583
So it's not such a stretch.

22:11.667 --> 22:13.875
I wonder if Paul
avenged his wife's death

22:13.959 --> 22:18.083
by killing Martha
for blackmailing them.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.625
But perhaps I'm alone in that.

22:21.709 --> 22:26.667
- You're not.
- Aren't you sweet? Tea?

22:26.750 --> 22:28.166
Thanks.

22:28.250 --> 22:32.125
Does this say anything about why
she was blackmailing the Youngs?

22:34.709 --> 22:36.291
Not specifically.

22:36.375 --> 22:41.125
But I got the definite impression
that it involved a murder,

22:41.208 --> 22:44.583
now here you are
saying your friend was murdered.

22:48.750 --> 22:52.083
Any reason you haven't
shown these to the police?

22:53.583 --> 22:56.542
Are you in favor of the death penalty?

22:56.625 --> 22:59.542
Yeah.

22:59.625 --> 23:03.375
So am I. We had it in Utah.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.875
Not in this state, though.

23:07.834 --> 23:11.750
A shame, don't you agree?

23:14.250 --> 23:16.458
Yeah, I do.

23:19.625 --> 23:22.667
I like you so much, Mr. Delfino.

23:25.875 --> 23:27.917
Do you know where Paul Young is?

23:29.583 --> 23:32.333
I'm afraid not.

23:34.583 --> 23:37.709
But I know where he'll be
on Thursday night.

23:48.542 --> 23:51.542
<i>That afternoon,</i>
<i>while retrieving her mail,</i>

23:51.625 --> 23:56.667
<i>Gabrielle was surprised to finally learn</i>
<i>the truth behind her pregnancy.</i>

24:00.792 --> 24:03.417
<i>Very surprised.</i>

24:03.500 --> 24:06.291
Babe, you want to go online
and check out strollers?

24:09.542 --> 24:11.291
What's going on?

24:11.375 --> 24:16.208
I just want to say goodbye,
because I'm leaving you.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.625
What?

24:19.709 --> 24:21.792
Our health insurance sent us a letter.

24:21.875 --> 24:24.291
Someone ordered
a year's worth of my pills.

24:24.375 --> 24:28.417
Apparently our policy
doesn't cover drugs bought by the kilo.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.625
I told you it was Mama.

24:30.709 --> 24:35.750
The prescription was dated. Juanita was
in a coma when this claim was filed.

24:35.834 --> 24:37.458
You did this. Not your mother.

24:37.542 --> 24:41.083
At least be man enough to own up to it.
She would have been.

24:47.875 --> 24:50.375
- Stop.
- Pregnant, caveman. Remember?

24:53.041 --> 24:55.417
- Where are you going?
- Away.

24:56.417 --> 24:59.542
I'm going to jail.
I'll be gone tomorrow.

24:59.625 --> 25:02.667
I know.
That's why I only packed one bag.

25:02.750 --> 25:06.959
What about the baby, Gabrielle?
What about my baby?

25:07.041 --> 25:10.542
- Your baby?
- Fine. Our baby.

25:10.625 --> 25:14.834
We're a family now. This baby needs
its mother and its father.

25:14.917 --> 25:19.542
Carlos.
Who ever said you were the father?

25:39.959 --> 25:42.125
Hey.

25:45.125 --> 25:46.375
Hey.

25:47.625 --> 25:50.458
Hey. What the hell are you doing?

25:51.291 --> 25:53.208
Damn felon.

26:07.834 --> 26:11.583
<i>All units, code D16-30.</i>
<i>Suspect is in violation of house arrest.</i>

26:11.667 --> 26:15.709
- <i>Heading west on Park Boulevard.</i>
- This is unit 14. We're on our way.

26:15.792 --> 26:19.917
- Looks like the Feds have a runner.
- Let's go.

26:34.291 --> 26:38.041
- Is John here?
- If I say no will you slap me again?

26:39.500 --> 26:41.583
He's working. Why?

26:41.667 --> 26:44.375
I just left my husband.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.792
Hang on.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.250
Think just because you mow my lawn,
you can bang my wife?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.834
Hey. What's going on?

28:04.917 --> 28:07.375
Tom, I have had the craziest day.

28:07.458 --> 28:11.458
This morning the guys from Mitchell
and Kerns call me and offer me a job.

28:11.542 --> 28:15.333
- Are you gonna take it?
- I told Peterson about it.

28:15.417 --> 28:19.250
He just upped their offer.
He just made me vice president.

28:21.208 --> 28:24.959
- Of what?
- Tom. The firm.

28:25.041 --> 28:27.834
He gave me Duggan's old job.
Isn't that wild?

28:28.792 --> 28:31.750
I gotta go tell Scotty.
I'll see you later.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.792
Tom, I was just coming to find you.

28:40.959 --> 28:44.875
What the hell, Dan?
I mean, what the hell?

28:44.959 --> 28:47.041
You promoted Annabel over me?

28:47.125 --> 28:50.875
She got another job offer.
I couldn't afford to lose her. Not now.

28:50.959 --> 28:54.709
Well, guess what. You lose me.
'Cause I quit.

28:54.792 --> 28:58.041
- Tom, don't overreact.
- No. The first time you passed me by

28:58.125 --> 29:02.709
I took it like a good soldier.
But I have already been doing the job.

29:02.792 --> 29:05.250
And then you just hand it to Annabel?

29:05.333 --> 29:07.667
OK. You made your point.

29:09.125 --> 29:13.125
You make crappy decisions on
a daily basis, Dan, I gotta tell you.

29:13.208 --> 29:16.917
- But this one, this is the stupidest.
- Hey, watch yourself.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.083
You have been running this company
into the ground.

29:20.166 --> 29:21.875
I'm getting out easy.

29:21.959 --> 29:25.333
All right. You want to know why
I gave that promotion to Annabel?

29:25.417 --> 29:27.834
Why she got the nod instead of you?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
It was Lynette.

29:32.583 --> 29:35.083
- What?
- She went to my wife and begged her

29:35.166 --> 29:36.959
to get me to kill your promotion.

29:37.041 --> 29:41.125
She said that if you start traveling
more, it's gonna hurt your family.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.083
She did that?

29:43.166 --> 29:45.709
Now I feel like a chump
for trying to help you.

29:45.792 --> 29:48.250
I guess it was one
of my crappy decisions.

29:48.333 --> 29:51.500
Have your desk cleaned out by tonight.

29:57.250 --> 29:59.834
You gonna tell us
what you got against this kid?

29:59.917 --> 30:02.792
It's between him and me. And my wife.

30:02.875 --> 30:06.458
Is that what this is about?
You doing his wife?

30:06.542 --> 30:09.375
No. I'm gay.

30:11.375 --> 30:13.417
- You're gay?
- What?

30:13.500 --> 30:15.625
I'm gay.

30:15.709 --> 30:17.917
This is not happening again.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.375
What do you mean, again?

30:22.542 --> 30:24.834
I want a lawyer.

30:39.166 --> 30:41.375
George.

30:41.458 --> 30:43.709
Hi. What are you doing here?

30:43.792 --> 30:46.542
I'm shopping. Obviously.

30:46.625 --> 30:49.291
You live on the other side of town.

30:49.375 --> 30:52.458
My friend had an operation.
I'm buying her some things.

30:52.542 --> 30:56.500
Oh. That's very nice of you.

30:56.583 --> 31:00.041
Wait. Bree.
I have to tell you something.

31:03.083 --> 31:04.792
Well?

31:04.875 --> 31:08.625
You need to tell Rex to be more discreet

31:08.709 --> 31:12.500
when it comes to
discussing your love life.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.834
- I'm sorry?
- I don't want to say anything more.

31:16.917 --> 31:20.709
You just really need to tell him that.

31:20.792 --> 31:23.959
Wait a minute.
What in the world are you talking about?

31:26.125 --> 31:29.750
I was at the hospital visiting my friend
who had had this operation.

31:29.834 --> 31:32.417
I overheard two doctors

31:32.500 --> 31:36.875
talking about Rex's fondness for S&M.

31:43.667 --> 31:45.875
You heard that?

31:45.959 --> 31:50.917
Apparently he told them
he has a box of toys

31:51.000 --> 31:56.291
and he gets you to do
very inappropriate things.

31:59.333 --> 32:00.917
I see.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.041
This is none of my business
and I would have never brought this up

32:05.125 --> 32:08.166
but to hear those two men
laughing about you...

32:08.250 --> 32:10.542
I just thought you should know.

32:11.834 --> 32:15.166
Thank you for telling me
but I think I gotta go.

32:36.291 --> 32:38.333
Hey, got some more boxes.

32:42.709 --> 32:45.166
That's your answer to everything
these days.

32:45.250 --> 32:47.333
What do you want to do for dinner?

32:47.417 --> 32:51.458
I can't.
I just got an emergency phone call.

32:51.542 --> 32:53.834
- Busted water main.
- OK.

32:53.917 --> 32:55.959
I'll keep it warm for you.

32:56.041 --> 32:58.792
I'm afraid
I'm gonna be too late for dinner.

32:58.875 --> 33:00.917
I wasn't talking about dinner.

33:15.709 --> 33:18.500
- Need some help?
- No.

33:18.583 --> 33:20.375
No, I got it.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.166
I got it.

33:23.083 --> 33:26.500
So if you have a plumbing emergency,
shouldn't you get going?

33:26.583 --> 33:29.208
I'm just part of the relief crew.

33:29.291 --> 33:32.417
Well, I'll just get back to work.

33:39.792 --> 33:43.542
Mum, stalking? Are we really doing this?

33:43.625 --> 33:46.458
You just made a huge deal
about how much you trust him.

33:46.542 --> 33:49.834
That was before I found
Mrs. Huber's journal in his truck.

33:51.417 --> 33:53.667
So what's in it?

33:53.750 --> 33:57.500
It's not about what's in it, it's about
the fact that he had it at all.

33:57.583 --> 34:02.041
I'd bet you anything he's not going on
a plumbing job and we're gonna find out.

34:04.875 --> 34:10.125
Mum, if you don't trust him,
why are you moving in with him?

34:12.625 --> 34:16.041
I don't have time to explain
adult relationships to you.

34:16.125 --> 34:18.000
Duck down.

34:22.417 --> 34:25.208
- I think you lost him.
- He's six cars up.

34:25.291 --> 34:27.542
We have to stay back or he'll see us.

34:27.625 --> 34:31.750
OK, great, but we can't see him either.
Mum, you're not great at this.

34:31.834 --> 34:35.834
Yeah? When your father was cheating
on me I used to follow him all the time.

34:35.917 --> 34:38.542
I know my stuff.

34:38.625 --> 34:40.542
There he is.

34:43.834 --> 34:46.709
What's Mike doing?
Who's he pulling up to?

34:46.792 --> 34:49.583
I don't know
but I'm gonna find out.

34:49.667 --> 34:51.458
Wait here.

34:51.542 --> 34:53.709
And lock the doors.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.250
What the hell are you up to?
My God.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
OK.

35:14.291 --> 35:16.792
Bye.

35:19.834 --> 35:24.667
- Was that your wife?
- If it was, would I be here with you?

35:32.834 --> 35:35.917
- It wasn't Mike, was it?
- No.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.291
No, it wasn't.

35:38.375 --> 35:40.750
They're charging you with a hate crime?

35:42.709 --> 35:45.583
Do you remember when
our cable guy was beaten up?

35:47.750 --> 35:50.041
That was me.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.125
I thought you were cheating with him.

35:54.208 --> 35:56.458
With our gay cable guy?

35:56.542 --> 35:58.542
I didn't know he was gay.

35:58.625 --> 36:01.458
I didn't know Justin was either.

36:01.542 --> 36:05.333
Now the cops think
I'm some kind of serial gay basher.

36:05.458 --> 36:07.834
- Well, you sort of are.
- You provoked me.

36:12.917 --> 36:15.875
You were pretending to have an affair
just to punish me.

36:17.458 --> 36:21.083
Well, obviously.

36:23.166 --> 36:25.291
So now I need you to lie again.

36:26.375 --> 36:29.291
I need you to tell the cops
you were having an affair

36:29.375 --> 36:32.583
and that I just beat up the wrong guy.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.834
Guys.

36:35.917 --> 36:37.834
I am not lying for you, Carlos.

36:38.792 --> 36:43.625
Gabby, if this charge sticks,
I get sent away for eight years.

36:43.709 --> 36:45.458
Am I supposed to be impressed?

36:45.542 --> 36:47.875
Because of your stunt with my pills,

36:47.959 --> 36:50.875
I've lost my freedom
for the next 18 years.

36:53.291 --> 36:56.291
Gabby, please don't do this.

36:56.375 --> 37:00.000
Gabby, don't walk away.

37:02.792 --> 37:04.375
Gabby.

37:07.208 --> 37:10.542
OK, next time I won't bring my daughter
to stalk my boyfriend.

37:10.625 --> 37:13.125
It was a slight error in judgment.

37:14.208 --> 37:18.250
Honey, please don't give me
the silent treatment.

37:18.333 --> 37:20.709
I'm not.

37:20.792 --> 37:24.709
- Did you say you read this?
- Part of it. Why?

37:27.125 --> 37:30.375
Mrs. Huber was blackmailing Zach's mum.

37:46.792 --> 37:48.709
Zach?

38:19.667 --> 38:21.375
What are you doing up?

38:22.667 --> 38:27.709
I couldn't sleep
so I was just sitting here.

38:27.792 --> 38:29.500
Thinking.

38:31.834 --> 38:33.458
About what?

38:36.583 --> 38:39.291
Do you really want to know?

38:39.375 --> 38:44.792
Bree, I'm not feeling too hot right now
so just tell me.

38:44.875 --> 38:46.917
What's up?

38:48.375 --> 38:51.750
I was thinking that
the biggest mistake of my entire life

38:51.875 --> 38:53.583
was agreeing to marry you.

38:58.125 --> 39:01.333
Let me guess. I've done something wrong.

39:03.583 --> 39:06.834
Forcing me to share in
your depraved pastime wasn't enough,

39:06.917 --> 39:09.875
you had to share my humiliation
with your co-workers?

39:11.250 --> 39:12.959
- What?
- Rex.

39:13.041 --> 39:15.792
Everybody is talking about our sex life.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.792
Every sordid little detail,

39:17.875 --> 39:20.625
right down to that
box of perversions in the closet.

39:20.709 --> 39:23.333
I never said anything to anyone.
I swear to God.

39:23.417 --> 39:25.291
- You're a liar.
- Who told you this?

39:25.375 --> 39:29.000
- Doesn't matter.
- It does. I never said anything.

39:29.083 --> 39:31.542
How do people know?
I wouldn't say anything.

39:31.625 --> 39:33.875
Why would I talk about
what we do in bed?

39:33.959 --> 39:36.500
I don't know, Rex.
Maybe you were bragging.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.583
Or maybe you just subconsciously
wanted to hurt me.

39:39.667 --> 39:43.166
Well, congratulations. You did it.
I am officially destroyed.

39:43.250 --> 39:46.583
- I didn't say anything.
- I don't believe you.

39:55.291 --> 39:58.333
Rex? What? What is it?

40:00.542 --> 40:03.375
I think I'm having a heart attack.

40:05.542 --> 40:08.458
No, you're not.

40:08.542 --> 40:11.291
Bree, you're gonna have to take me
to the hospital.

40:16.250 --> 40:20.583
All right. You go downstairs

40:20.667 --> 40:24.000
and I will be...
I'll be right there.

40:42.750 --> 40:45.417
Daddy? What are you doing?

40:46.667 --> 40:50.542
I'm waiting for your mother
to take me to the Emergency Room.

40:50.625 --> 40:54.208
- What's wrong?
- I'm having a heart attack.

40:54.291 --> 40:56.583
My God. Where is she?

40:56.667 --> 40:59.875
That's a good question.

41:01.750 --> 41:07.125
- Daddy's having a heart attack.
- I know. I'm taking him to hospital.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.250
Well, when?

41:12.208 --> 41:14.000
When I finish making the bed.

41:15.083 --> 41:16.333
What?

41:16.417 --> 41:21.125
I never leave the house
with an unmade bed. You know that.

41:21.208 --> 41:23.959
But Daddy needs to go to the hospital.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.083
There. Now we can go.

41:40.583 --> 41:43.500
<i>Nothing is forever.</i>

41:43.583 --> 41:48.291
<i>And the time comes when we all must</i>
<i>say goodbye to the world we knew.</i>

41:52.250 --> 41:55.875
<i>Goodbye to everything</i>
<i>we had taken for granted.</i>

42:01.500 --> 42:05.250
<i>Goodbye to those</i>
<i>we thought would never abandon us.</i>

42:11.041 --> 42:14.083
<i>And when these changes finally do occur,</i>

42:16.250 --> 42:18.750
<i>when the familiar has departed,</i>

42:18.834 --> 42:22.333
<i>and the unfamiliar has taken its place,</i>

42:24.625 --> 42:27.834
<i>all any of us can really do</i>

42:27.917 --> 42:30.125
<i>is to say hello...</i>

42:31.333 --> 42:32.792
<i>and welcome.</i>
