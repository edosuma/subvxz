00:00.180 --> 00:05.018
[indistinct chatter]

00:06.351 --> 00:07.550
[clears throat] Um...

00:08.052 --> 00:10.720
Thank you all very much
for this going away party.

00:10.722 --> 00:14.115
It's very unnecessary,
and a little awkward.

00:15.023 --> 00:17.760
I'd just like to propose
a toast to my man.

00:17.762 --> 00:20.830
I'm sorry, did you bring
champagne for one person?

00:20.832 --> 00:24.150
In a way, this is a
celebration of us reuniting.

00:24.152 --> 00:25.401
No, no, I am celebrating

00:25.403 --> 00:26.769
never having to work with Jeff again.

00:26.771 --> 00:27.803
Not you two reuniting.

00:27.805 --> 00:30.065
Frankly, think this is a mismatch.

00:30.341 --> 00:32.552
I'll miss your candor, Dina.

00:32.977 --> 00:37.163
Hey, why don't we all go around
and tell our favorite Jeff story?

00:37.165 --> 00:40.283
Okay, I want to go first.
Jeff, I remember once,

00:40.285 --> 00:42.285
you brought a ham sandwich,

00:42.287 --> 00:45.171
and I was like, typical Jeff.

00:45.890 --> 00:47.323
I remember when we bonded

00:47.325 --> 00:49.125
over having seen "The Danish Girl."

00:49.127 --> 00:50.893
I've never seen "The Danish Girl."

00:50.895 --> 00:52.962
That wasn't... Oh.

00:52.964 --> 00:55.164
That was, that was Dale. I'm sorry.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.772
I remember when I let you

00:56.773 --> 00:59.268
borrow my air mattress
for your camping trip.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.386
Remember that?

01:00.388 --> 01:02.305
I'm going to need that back, actually.

01:02.307 --> 01:05.174
- Of course, thank you, ASAP.
- Yeah, great.

01:05.176 --> 01:07.532
Even though we never actually dated,

01:07.812 --> 01:10.279
I spent several months
telling people we did.

01:10.716 --> 01:15.057
And I created these intricate
memories of our relationship

01:15.453 --> 01:17.113
that feel completely real.

01:17.522 --> 01:20.823
And I have these vivid memories

01:20.825 --> 01:24.137
of your body on top of me.

01:24.963 --> 01:26.721
Your tongue in my mouth.

01:27.298 --> 01:29.858
Your hands on my breasts.

01:31.287 --> 01:32.511
That kind of thing.

01:33.121 --> 01:37.473
Whoo, what a trip down memory lane, huh?

01:37.475 --> 01:41.077
Jeff, you are always welcome at Cloud 9.

01:41.079 --> 01:44.096
In fact, our café is very
popular with the unemployed.

01:44.098 --> 01:46.182
Oh, uh, I'm not unemployed.

01:46.184 --> 01:49.118
I took a job as a manager with Target.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.366
Although at Target,
we call it a store lead.

01:53.091 --> 01:55.524
- You're at Target.
- Yes, the one on Forest Park.

01:55.526 --> 01:58.094
So uh, hope you're ready
for some competition.

01:58.096 --> 02:00.296
- Okay, I mean, bring it on.
- Oh, yeah?

02:00.298 --> 02:01.931
- Yeah.
- All right.

02:01.933 --> 02:03.849
I'll clean your clock
with arm and hammer.

02:03.851 --> 02:05.901
- You know?
- [Both laughing]

02:05.903 --> 02:07.348
- [grunts]
- Oh.

02:07.582 --> 02:09.437
- Jeff, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.974
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- It's okay.

02:11.976 --> 02:13.376
- Just got me in the...
- I'm sorry.

02:13.378 --> 02:14.303
Throat a little bit.

Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

02:20.271 --> 02:22.338
I can't believe Jeff is going to Target.

02:23.116 --> 02:24.686
So what if Jeff works to Target?

02:24.687 --> 02:25.846
What is the big deal?

02:26.190 --> 02:28.483
Jeff has seen Cloud 9 from the inside.

02:28.484 --> 02:30.682
He knows all our secrets.
It's like in football,

02:30.683 --> 02:32.616
when they trade
a player to another team,

02:32.618 --> 02:34.498
and then that player knows
how to beat his old team.

02:34.522 --> 02:37.143
Yeah, but don't they do that
all the time in football?

02:37.269 --> 02:38.407
Like, isn't that like, a thing?

02:38.409 --> 02:41.448
Amy, don't talk sports.
You're embarrassing yourself.

02:42.247 --> 02:45.792
It's newly renovated, but it
still has its original molding,

02:45.793 --> 02:48.151
and it's in walking distance
to the farmer's market.

02:48.153 --> 02:50.102
That place looks great.
You should take it.

02:50.104 --> 02:52.405
It just feels a little small,

02:52.407 --> 02:54.323
or claustrophobic, or something.

02:54.325 --> 02:56.459
Well, I mean, we're not going
to find something perfect.

02:56.461 --> 02:58.728
I mean, you said the
last one was too loud.

02:58.730 --> 03:00.429
The one before that was on a slant,

03:00.431 --> 03:02.999
and the one before that
had a weird curry smell.

03:03.001 --> 03:05.501
And I actually like curry,
but that was a bad curry.

03:05.503 --> 03:08.371
And the scary part is,
like, what's it covering?

03:08.373 --> 03:10.673
- What aren't you smelling?
- Just think.

03:10.675 --> 03:13.438
You'll get to wake up
to stuff like that every day.

03:14.002 --> 03:16.112
Okay, you remember the guy
from the pet store?

03:16.114 --> 03:17.847
- Uh, no.
- You remember.

03:17.849 --> 03:21.417
- The guy from the pet store.
- Oh, yeah, continue.

03:21.419 --> 03:22.752
We're meeting for lunch today,

03:22.753 --> 03:24.626
and he's bringing a friend.

03:26.958 --> 03:29.266
Oh, oh, oh, you mean, for me?

03:29.875 --> 03:31.844
No, no, no. No, no.

03:31.846 --> 03:33.952
Ah, come on, I really like this guy.

03:34.152 --> 03:35.685
He makes me feel like...

03:36.701 --> 03:38.932
Have you ever fired a gun into the sky?

03:39.771 --> 03:41.737
Well I mean, I guess if you really...

03:41.739 --> 03:43.139
I've already told him
how desperate you are,

03:43.141 --> 03:45.341
and he says his friend is fine with it.

03:45.343 --> 03:48.358
How nice. Um, you know what, Dina,

03:48.359 --> 03:49.572
actually, I think I'm going to pass.

03:49.666 --> 03:51.578
I made myself a PB&J for lunch

03:51.579 --> 03:54.116
that I have been looking
forward to all morning.

03:54.118 --> 03:57.286
So maybe next time,

03:57.288 --> 03:59.422
if there's, you know,

03:59.696 --> 04:00.523
[stammers]

04:03.444 --> 04:05.061
Oh, oh, hi, yeah, um,

04:05.063 --> 04:07.697
I want to buy a dog with
a birthmark around its eye,

04:07.699 --> 04:09.674
but in the shape of a blue cloud.

04:10.335 --> 04:12.928
Well, your website says
you have all breeds.

04:13.171 --> 04:15.408
Well, that's misleading,
don't you think?

04:15.740 --> 04:17.125
Well, I do!

04:18.409 --> 04:21.843
Sorry, dealing with some
false advertising there.

04:21.937 --> 04:23.849
- What's up?
- Look, I need to talk to you.

04:23.850 --> 04:26.015
Uh, my living expenses
are about to go up

04:26.017 --> 04:27.617
- now that Jonah's moving out.
- Okay.

04:27.619 --> 04:30.671
And um, well, I've been
working here for a while,

04:31.373 --> 04:32.846
and I'm a hard worker.

04:33.253 --> 04:34.889
Er, I'm a worker.

04:34.890 --> 04:36.948
Garrett, I'm sorry, I can't
deal with this right now.

04:36.949 --> 04:39.637
I am in the dance off
of my life with Target.

04:40.064 --> 04:41.726
- Sorry.
- Hmm.

04:42.433 --> 04:44.367
Uh, well, you know, Jeff
offered me a job at Target

04:44.369 --> 04:47.303
- for a dollar more an hour.
- He what?

04:47.305 --> 04:49.345
But you don't have to worry about it.

04:49.774 --> 04:52.579
Because I told him that you
would probably match it.

04:52.944 --> 04:56.112
- That bald little weasel!
- What?

04:56.114 --> 04:58.164
What are you, wait, whoa, wait, hold on.

04:58.166 --> 05:00.249
Not enough that he's trying
to steal our secrets.

05:00.251 --> 05:03.185
But then he comes after
my second coolest employee?

05:03.187 --> 05:05.805
- Oh, I don't think so.
- You don't need to do...

05:05.807 --> 05:07.384
Who's the first coolest employee?

05:07.385 --> 05:11.227
Oh, Hi Jeff, it's Glenn
Sturgis from Cloud 9.

05:11.229 --> 05:15.164
We need to talk face to face,
at your earliest convenience.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.875
Okay, bye-bye.

05:18.870 --> 05:20.994
He doesn't know who he's dealing with.

05:23.007 --> 05:23.689
Oh.

05:26.110 --> 05:27.546
Pistachio shells.

05:30.581 --> 05:34.050
♪ Where you shouldn't
have been messing ♪

05:34.052 --> 05:37.486
♪ And now someone else
is getting all your ♪

05:37.488 --> 05:40.939
Wow, he is so hot. Is he a model?

05:40.940 --> 05:42.457
He's a lawyer, but I think he used to be

05:42.460 --> 05:44.827
a skydiving instructor, and he
does a lot of charity work.

05:44.829 --> 05:46.429
- That's perfect.
- Who is this?

05:46.431 --> 05:49.282
Oh, Dina's setting me up
with her boyfriend's friend.

05:49.767 --> 05:53.536
- Holy [bleep].
- I know, right?

05:53.538 --> 05:56.972
- You're all like, lucky bitch.
- Well, I mean,

05:56.974 --> 05:59.508
- now I wish I was going.
- Okay, Amy's in.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.392
Justine, you can eat lunch
alone, like always.

06:01.441 --> 06:03.085
What? Thanks a lot, Amy.

06:03.086 --> 06:05.131
I'm so sorry, I didn't
mean for that to happen.

06:05.133 --> 06:06.483
Okay, Justine, you're back in.

06:06.484 --> 06:08.118
No, no, now it's just getting confusing,

06:08.119 --> 06:10.051
going back and forth, so I'll just go.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.536
You know, just to make it easy.

06:14.006 --> 06:15.771
- You sure?
- Oh, my God, yes.

06:15.911 --> 06:19.629
Well, what looks good?

06:21.132 --> 06:22.255
[clears throat]

06:23.434 --> 06:25.234
So that picture you showed me.

06:25.236 --> 06:27.269
That wasn't a black and white filter?

06:27.271 --> 06:29.345
Oh, no. He's old.

06:35.507 --> 06:40.011
Hey, Jeff, the man in red!
What are you doing here?

06:40.012 --> 06:41.579
Uh, I got a meeting with Glenn.

06:41.581 --> 06:43.494
Oh, okay, okay. Well hold up, man.

06:43.534 --> 06:45.850
Jeez, it has been forever
since we had a chat.

06:45.852 --> 06:47.185
- Yes.
- You watch the show

06:47.187 --> 06:48.836
- last night?
- Uh, what show?

06:48.838 --> 06:50.154
I don't know, any of them.
I like them all.

06:50.156 --> 06:52.118
Hey, you like chicken wings, right?

06:52.119 --> 06:53.730
- Not really.
- Well, that's great.

06:53.731 --> 06:55.287
Because I'm going to
take you to lunch to a place

06:55.288 --> 06:56.849
that does not sell them. Let's go.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.815
I cannot do that now,
but thank you for the invite.

06:58.816 --> 07:00.736
Do me a favor, just text me
the name of the restaurant.

07:00.737 --> 07:02.015
I'm always looking for a new spot.

07:02.016 --> 07:03.881
Okay, well hey, don't worry
about what Glenn says.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.178
'Cause, you know,
typical Glenn. [Laughs]

07:07.669 --> 07:09.965
So how do the
two of you know each other?

07:10.667 --> 07:12.970
His older sister babysat me.

07:18.985 --> 07:20.718
[whispering] What does that mean?

07:21.557 --> 07:25.516
There, see, plenty of space.
You got room for the couch,

07:25.594 --> 07:27.094
and there's the coffee table,

07:27.096 --> 07:28.616
and here's your beat up bookcase.

07:28.633 --> 07:30.867
That's not beat up.
That's reclaimed wood.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.565
Uh, well, the point is, everything fits.

07:33.745 --> 07:36.370
- Mmm, it does feel spacious.
- Yeah.

07:36.371 --> 07:39.723
But it's misleading.
We don't just live like this.

07:39.725 --> 07:42.359
We live like this.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.407
What is happening?
I don't think I live like that.

07:44.408 --> 07:46.842
Two-dimensionally, this is fine.

07:47.977 --> 07:49.282
We need to go 3-D.

07:50.019 --> 07:51.501
You can't just imagine?

07:52.209 --> 07:54.193
- 3-D.
- 3-D.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.470
Thank you for coming in, Jeff.

08:02.014 --> 08:03.530
That's more comfortable.

08:03.532 --> 08:05.699
Um, I wanted to have
a sit down with you,

08:05.701 --> 08:08.268
so that we could go over
the rules of the game.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.537
- What game?
- Okay, look.

08:10.539 --> 08:12.914
Let's not insult each other, all right?

08:13.008 --> 08:15.394
If you respect me, I'll respect you.

08:15.464 --> 08:18.591
But if you start trying
to pooch my people,

08:18.864 --> 08:20.399
then we are going to have a problem.

08:20.446 --> 08:21.979
Pooch? Did you mean "poach"?

08:21.980 --> 08:24.661
- Don't play dumb with me!
- Okay, Glenn.

08:24.661 --> 08:26.682
Not sure what you're trying to do,
but you don't have to intimidate me.

08:26.683 --> 08:28.700
No, you don't tell me what to do, okay?

08:28.701 --> 08:30.635
Because you're not my boss anymore.

08:31.002 --> 08:33.136
You're just another schmo, like me,

08:33.138 --> 08:35.263
down here in the dirt
with the rest of us.

08:35.316 --> 08:36.058
Yeah.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.942
[gruff voice] You don't like it, do you?

08:39.038 --> 08:41.105
[gruff voice] Down here in the dirt.

08:41.160 --> 08:42.873
Well here, let me clean you up.

08:43.178 --> 08:45.585
- What, don't do that.
- Well, then stop

08:45.586 --> 08:47.148
trying to steal my people.

08:47.150 --> 08:49.091
Hey, I'm not trying to steal
your people. Stop spraying me

08:49.092 --> 08:51.004
- with the bottle.
- Liar, liar.

08:51.005 --> 08:53.081
Stop spraying me with
the bottle, I'm not lying!

08:53.304 --> 08:54.294
Mmm.

08:55.717 --> 08:56.725
One more time.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.029
Spray me one more time.

09:05.416 --> 09:07.954
You want to poach? Let's poach.

09:09.197 --> 09:10.888
What, no, I don't want to poach.

09:10.889 --> 09:12.573
That's what this was all about.

09:12.628 --> 09:15.149
Were you even listening
to what I was saying?

09:15.251 --> 09:17.433
It's interesting, because
when they were young,

09:17.434 --> 09:20.432
it was Loraine who wanted
to be the geologist,

09:20.510 --> 09:22.692
and Edwin who wanted to be the lawyer.

09:22.879 --> 09:26.011
Wow, well, a lot can
change over 30 years.

09:26.773 --> 09:28.088
[chuckles]

09:28.089 --> 09:30.190
Oh, look, they have
the same beverage rep we do.

09:30.283 --> 09:31.786
You know, that's funny,
I always thought his district

09:31.787 --> 09:33.163
went west from the store, and not east.

09:33.164 --> 09:34.637
But what do you know? East.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.979
[laughs] I love your stories.

09:37.021 --> 09:38.406
Aww. [Laughs]

09:40.156 --> 09:43.108
You know what, I actually
have to talk to that guy.

09:43.852 --> 09:46.327
- Can't it wait?
- No, it can't.

09:46.329 --> 09:47.962
You know how I am with beverages.

09:47.964 --> 09:48.852
Excuse me.

09:51.233 --> 09:53.806
She's coo-coo for liquids. [Laughs]

09:54.468 --> 09:56.470
Hi, hey, excuse me, uh, my name is Amy.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.062
I work at Cloud 9,
I'm on a terrible date

09:58.063 --> 10:00.592
with a grandfather, so I just
need to look like I'm talking

10:00.593 --> 10:02.704
to you about some business.
Can you help me?

10:02.705 --> 10:04.707
Yeah, should I just nod a lot,

10:04.708 --> 10:06.266
like you're saying
something really important?

10:06.267 --> 10:08.296
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nodding would be great.

10:08.297 --> 10:11.237
Wow, that's a very
insightful point you're making

10:11.238 --> 10:13.217
about the uh, beverages.

10:13.599 --> 10:16.497
Um, and now, I am pointing,

10:16.957 --> 10:19.004
because we are in a disagreement.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.796
Oof, she is really laying into him.

10:22.708 --> 10:25.034
Sorry, Walter, she can be
a bit of a handful.

10:25.035 --> 10:26.834
- [laughs]
- [purrs suggestively]

10:26.835 --> 10:29.960

Yeah, great.

10:44.247 --> 10:45.583
Still don't understand why Glenn wants

10:45.584 --> 10:47.665
a living room display set up
in the middle of everything.

10:47.666 --> 10:49.602
I don't know, the guy's falling apart.

10:50.196 --> 10:52.547
[exhales] Okay, well.

10:53.265 --> 10:54.595
This still works for me.

10:55.033 --> 10:58.893
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's Sunday, we're relaxing.

10:58.894 --> 11:00.132
- Yeah.
- Wait.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.415
- Where am I putting my coffee?
- Uh, well,

11:03.416 --> 11:06.798
I'm just spitballing here,
but maybe the coffee table?

11:06.799 --> 11:09.200
Yeah, but then I'm always
leaning over to get the coffee.

11:09.201 --> 11:10.362
You know? And then, if I want to

11:10.363 --> 11:12.983
- put my feet up, I kick it over.
- Right.

11:12.984 --> 11:14.905
We're going to need
an end table right here.

11:14.906 --> 11:17.255
Okay, good, yeah,
we will get an end table.

11:17.256 --> 11:18.800
Well, you can't just get one end table.

11:18.801 --> 11:21.403
You need another one
to match for the other side.

11:21.700 --> 11:25.016
Mm-hmm, uh, well then,
two end tables coming up.

11:26.902 --> 11:28.560
Do we have enough
seating for game night?

11:28.561 --> 11:29.296
I'm on it.

11:30.459 --> 11:32.254
Oh, this is a pleasant surprise.

11:32.255 --> 11:34.253
- Not now, Mateo.
- Excuse me?

11:34.254 --> 11:36.078
Attention, everyone.

11:36.079 --> 11:37.720
Who here would like to come with me,

11:37.721 --> 11:40.929
- and join the Target family?
- Jeff, what are you doing?

11:40.930 --> 11:43.589
No, no, no, you leave my people alone.

11:43.590 --> 11:45.035
Or you'll do what? I told you,

11:45.036 --> 11:46.356
if I want your people, I'll take them.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.920
You hate most of the
people who work here.

11:47.921 --> 11:48.635
You talk about it all the time.

11:48.636 --> 11:50.125
Yes, I'm mainly doing it out of spite.

11:50.219 --> 11:53.145
- Who wants to join?
- No one wants to join you!

11:53.146 --> 11:56.618
We're loyal to Cloud 9 here.
Nobody likes Target.

11:56.915 --> 11:57.862
I love Target.

11:57.863 --> 12:00.706
I like to call it "Tarzhay,"
like it's fancy.

12:00.707 --> 12:03.001
Listen, Target is a better store.

- They treat their people better.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.557

12:11.558 --> 12:13.606
It's generally just a very cool store.

12:13.730 --> 12:15.371
Good arguments on both sides.

12:15.372 --> 12:18.509
Why don't we all just go home,
and think about it overnight?

12:18.595 --> 12:19.677
I'll go with you, Jeff.

12:20.005 --> 12:22.178
And I promise to keep it professional.

12:22.514 --> 12:24.725
Well, technically,
it was always professional,

12:24.726 --> 12:26.594
except for in your,
you know what, whatever, fine.

12:26.595 --> 12:29.093
Sandra, he doesn't really want you.

12:29.312 --> 12:32.047
He's just upset because
Garrett wouldn't go with him.

12:32.125 --> 12:35.105
Yeah, that's right.
And I'm staying, Jeff.

12:35.106 --> 12:37.571
- So, sorry.
- Ha, you just lost Garrett.

12:37.572 --> 12:39.777
- Enjoy your Garrett-less store.
- Fine.

12:39.778 --> 12:42.653
- He's incompetent, anyhow.
- Hold up, I'm not incompetent.

12:42.654 --> 12:45.264
- I just don't try.
- Get out of my store.

12:46.014 --> 12:48.272
- You are banned from Cloud 9.
- Are you...

12:48.273 --> 12:51.433
- Stop pushing me, Glenn.
- No, I'm throwing you,

12:51.434 --> 12:52.997
- take that, ow!
- Oh!

12:52.998 --> 12:55.120
Yeah, don't, hey, this is abuse!

12:58.118 --> 13:01.011

Oh, uh,

13:01.737 --> 13:04.690
Glenn asked us to put together
a living room display, so...

13:04.824 --> 13:07.001
He said it was a priority.

13:07.729 --> 13:09.695
Glenn asked you to do a display?

13:09.697 --> 13:11.942
Why would he ask you and not me?

13:13.048 --> 13:13.958
I don't know.

13:14.705 --> 13:15.935
- He just did.
- Yeah.

13:17.391 --> 13:20.273
You don't think Glenn's mad
at me because of Jeff, do you?

13:20.275 --> 13:21.707
- Oh...
- Yeah.

13:21.959 --> 13:24.026
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's probably it.

- [laughs]

13:34.973 --> 13:36.727
You sure you're not into him?

13:37.244 --> 13:38.757
- He seems wise.
- Ah.

13:38.757 --> 13:40.390
Like the kind of guy
that has a lot of information

13:40.392 --> 13:42.526
- about the early days of cars.
- Oh, ha, okay.

13:42.528 --> 13:44.261
You've got jokes. Well,

13:44.263 --> 13:46.925
I am upset about how much movie
tickets cost me these days,

13:46.926 --> 13:49.433
so maybe I could take advantage
of his senior discount.

13:49.435 --> 13:50.600
Well, if you're not going to go for him,

13:50.602 --> 13:52.436
- I might take a shot.
- [Laughs]

13:52.438 --> 13:54.638
- Don't laugh, they're watching.
- Oh!

13:55.031 --> 13:57.383
Um, what do we talk about now?

13:58.043 --> 14:00.210
If Jeff is going to pooch our people,

14:00.212 --> 14:02.923
well I say let's see how
he likes it when we pooch his.

14:02.924 --> 14:04.848
Yeah, I'll show him how incompetent I am

14:04.850 --> 14:07.122
- at taking his employees.
- What?

14:07.611 --> 14:09.086
Well, Jeff said that
I was being incompetent,

14:09.088 --> 14:10.353
so it was kind of like wordplay.

14:10.355 --> 14:12.055
Man, never mind, sorry. Forcing it.

14:12.057 --> 14:14.224
All right, well, let's see who's going

14:14.226 --> 14:16.059
to want to leave this dump.

14:17.454 --> 14:19.409
Wow, it's really nice in here.

14:20.232 --> 14:22.709
Wow, the red's so lively.
It really pops.

I just don't understand
how someone can hate the sun.

14:26.405 --> 14:28.371
Well, I mean, no, I don't hate the sun.

14:28.373 --> 14:31.508
I just find it really annoying.
I do hate the beach, though.

14:31.510 --> 14:32.909
Because my parents took me

14:32.911 --> 14:35.127
on this god-awful trip
to the Gulf Coast...

14:35.631 --> 14:37.747
Come on, you are missing the whole date.

14:37.749 --> 14:40.331
And we are on a time crunch.
Walter can't drive at night.

14:40.332 --> 14:43.157
Right, sure. So, um, next time,

14:43.889 --> 14:46.323
less diet, more regular. Got it?

14:46.325 --> 14:48.305
Got it, got it, I don't know
why it took me so long

14:48.306 --> 14:50.610
to understand that very simple point.

14:52.664 --> 14:55.382
You're welcome, now let's
get back to the table.

15:17.689 --> 15:19.185
feel cramped. I mean, we have, like,

15:19.186 --> 15:20.674
five ottomans, a million chairs,

15:20.676 --> 15:22.626
a steamer trunk.
I mean, there's wicker balls.

15:22.628 --> 15:24.361
You brought in a mannequin
for some reason.

15:24.363 --> 15:25.760
That's supposed to represent a guest.

15:25.761 --> 15:27.414
Dude, what is going on?

15:27.416 --> 15:29.432
Do you want to move in together, or not?

15:29.434 --> 15:32.966
Of course I do.
I'm the one who suggested it.

15:32.967 --> 15:34.571
Right, but is it because you wanted to,

15:34.573 --> 15:36.406
or because you felt bad
about the Amy stuff?

15:36.408 --> 15:39.399
Because, if so,
you know, that's, that's dumb.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.674
That was part of it, okay?

15:41.980 --> 15:43.430
You could have mentioned this to me

15:43.432 --> 15:46.198
before we brought in the
entire furniture department.

15:46.722 --> 15:47.351
Well.

15:48.687 --> 15:50.187
Earl did most of the work.

15:51.039 --> 15:53.140
Did you know that Cloud 9 employees

15:53.141 --> 15:56.591
get a 5% discount
on anything in the store?

15:56.895 --> 15:59.080
Cool, ours is actually higher than that.

15:59.598 --> 16:01.685
Well, yeah, but if you worked there,

16:01.900 --> 16:03.633
you'd have a shorter commute.

16:03.635 --> 16:05.852
Um, you don't know where I live.

16:05.854 --> 16:08.305
Well, you can tell me

16:15.514 --> 16:17.681
Isn't that the store
where they found a foot?

16:18.043 --> 16:20.450
Yeah, it's one of the Cloud 9 stores

16:20.452 --> 16:21.820
where a foot was found, yes.

16:21.821 --> 16:23.653

pay you more here at Target,

that you can't put a price on.

16:28.243 --> 16:31.025
- Making it rain!
- Like that.

16:31.463 --> 16:32.862
Can't put a price on that.

- Okay, look, I know that's

17:11.119 --> 17:14.492
not true, because I've seen you

- [grunts]
- Smack it,

18:23.223 --> 18:25.758
- and see what happens.
- No, don't...

18:25.759 --> 18:28.424
- It comes apart.
- [Both laugh]

18:28.425 --> 18:30.440
- It's a...
- Let's move in together.

18:33.233 --> 18:36.501
- Jonah, you don't have to...
- No, I mean it, I mean it.

18:36.502 --> 18:39.587
I want to.
I would like to live with you.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.658
I, literally, I just told that guy

18:43.660 --> 18:45.327
that he could move in with me.

18:47.247 --> 18:49.214
- That guy?
- Mm-hmm.

18:49.216 --> 18:51.039
I knew it, I always
lose out to that guy.

18:51.040 --> 18:51.911
[laughs]

18:53.086 --> 18:55.131
Hey, this is nice.

18:55.672 --> 18:58.340
Well, I'm trying to get
back on Glenn's good side.

18:58.342 --> 19:00.058
I love the fact that
you quit your job for me,

19:00.060 --> 19:01.676
but I just wish you hadn't told everyone

19:01.678 --> 19:04.131
- that you got a job at Target.
- I just couldn't...

19:04.514 --> 19:07.015
Admit to everybody around here
that I'm unemployed.

19:07.017 --> 19:09.517
I mean, people think of me
as this powerful guy

19:09.519 --> 19:11.403
who's got it all going on,
and I just don't want

19:11.405 --> 19:14.376
- to let everybody down.
- So you don't work at Target?

19:15.242 --> 19:18.894
No, but um, I'm in the mix.

19:20.364 --> 19:21.164
Cool.

19:22.032 --> 19:23.302
I got to go find Glenn.

19:26.086 --> 19:29.754
We might as well accept,
we work in an inferior store.

19:29.756 --> 19:31.341
With inferior benefits.

19:32.303 --> 19:33.884
And inferior popcorn.

19:34.461 --> 19:36.795
- We don't even have popcorn.
- Oh, shut up.

19:37.179 --> 19:39.793
Hey, sorry, you can't eat
food on the display furniture.

19:39.794 --> 19:43.101
Oh, hey, Owen, it's okay.
These are my Cloud 9 friends.

19:43.103 --> 19:46.107
- Well, Cloud 9 friend and boss.
- Oh, this is Glenn.

19:47.391 --> 19:50.416
- You, you talk about me?
- Of course I do.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.843
Oh, I'm just so surprised.

19:53.230 --> 19:55.830
Just that, she never
talks about you guys at all.

19:55.831 --> 19:57.700
Not at all. I mean, I didn't even know

19:57.701 --> 19:59.190
she worked here until today.

20:00.070 --> 20:01.486
- Okay.
- Hey, Owen,

20:01.488 --> 20:03.826
does she ever talk about me?
I'm Garrett.

20:06.149 --> 20:07.734
Yeah. [Chuckles awkwardly]

20:08.495 --> 20:10.766
Hey, what do you think of Jeff?

20:11.415 --> 20:12.871
- Jeff who?
- [laughs]

20:13.164 --> 20:15.043
Exactly, Jeff who.

20:16.002 --> 20:17.469
So I just got a text from Hank.

20:17.471 --> 20:21.256
- Apparently, Walter is into you.
- Oh, cool.

20:21.258 --> 20:22.674
Yeah, he thinks you had
a great connection.

20:22.676 --> 20:24.092
I knew you two would hit it off.

20:24.094 --> 20:25.677
Anyway, he wants you to give him a call,

20:25.679 --> 20:27.429
but if you get his voice-mail,
don't leave a message

20:27.431 --> 20:28.976
because he doesn't know
how to retrieve them.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.433
Meanwhile, Hank and I
are meeting up again tonight.

20:31.435 --> 20:33.485
Do you want me to describe
the sex to you tomorrow,

20:33.486 --> 20:34.757
or show you a QuickTime?

20:34.758 --> 20:36.688
Uh, yeah, no, that sounds great.

20:36.689 --> 20:38.261
Really? I'll send you a file.

20:39.109 --> 20:41.326
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

20:41.328 --> 20:44.724
- Hi, what are you doing here?
- Oh, um,

20:44.881 --> 20:47.906
- your store is on my route.
- Yeah, no, I know,

20:47.907 --> 20:49.861
but don't we usually get
deliveries on Tuesdays?

20:49.862 --> 20:53.899
Um, that is 100 percent true.
But, uh, my boss called,

20:53.900 --> 20:55.544
and he said hey,
can you switch things up

20:55.545 --> 20:57.175
- and go by there today.
- Oh.

20:57.177 --> 20:59.001
And, you know, he's my boss, so.

20:59.596 --> 21:00.437
So.

21:01.431 --> 21:02.447
Here I am.

21:03.850 --> 21:04.988
Here you are.
