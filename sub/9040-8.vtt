WEBVTT

00:04.333 --> 00:06.033
- HEY, THE GEARS
ARE STRIPPED HERE.

00:06.033 --> 00:09.767
YOU LET THE KIDS PLAY
WITH THIS?

00:09.767 --> 00:12.200
- YEAH. YEAH, THE KIDS
DID THAT, DAD.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.633
IT HAD, UH, NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU

00:13.633 --> 00:17.767
PLOPPING YOUR JUMBO CAN
IN THERE EVERY DAY.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.500
- AHH, THERE WE GO.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.200
- YEAH, THERE'S A GIFT FOR ME--

00:22.200 --> 00:25.333
TWO BUSHELS OF NOSE HAIR.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.500
- HEY.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.800
- HEY. HEY.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.967
- HI.
- THIS IS ERICA.

00:31.967 --> 00:35.833
- WELL, HELLO THERE.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.167
- UNCLE ROBERT!
UNCLE ROBBIE!

00:37.167 --> 00:40.733
- HEY, YOU LITTLE MONKEYS.
HI.

00:40.733 --> 00:41.967
SAY HELLO TO ERICA.

00:41.967 --> 00:43.633
- I'VE HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

00:43.633 --> 00:46.267
YOU MUST BE ALLY, AND...

00:46.267 --> 00:49.433
THIS MUST BE GEOFFREY
AND MICHAEL.

00:49.433 --> 00:51.167
ROBERT TOLD ME
ABOUT THE FRECKLE PATTERNS.

00:51.167 --> 00:53.267
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S
AN EASIER WAY TO TELL.

00:53.267 --> 00:57.000
GEOFFREY, RAISE YOUR HAND.
THAT'S GEOFFREY.

00:59.367 --> 01:01.333
- ACTUALLY, WE WERE ON OUR WAY
TO GO BOWLING,

01:01.333 --> 01:03.000
BUT ERICA WANTED
TO MEET THE KIDS.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.733
- HI.
- HEY, DEB.

01:04.733 --> 01:05.767
THIS IS ERICA.

01:05.767 --> 01:07.000
- OH, HI.
- HI.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.333
- I'M MARIE,
ROBERT'S MOTHER.

01:08.333 --> 01:09.867
ARE YOU TWO DATING?

01:09.867 --> 01:11.300
- MA.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.767
- WELL, WE JUST MET
LAST WEEK.

01:12.767 --> 01:14.167
- AT EMERSON SAVINGS.

01:14.167 --> 01:15.500
- WOW, OPEN
A CHECKING ACCOUNT,

01:15.500 --> 01:17.800
GET A FREE GIRL.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.900
I'M GOING DOWN THERE.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.267
[laughter]

01:20.267 --> 01:21.600
- SORRY,
I WAS THE LAST ONE.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.500
- [laughs]

01:23.500 --> 01:25.700
THIS ONE'S GOT
A SENSE OF HUMOR.

01:25.700 --> 01:29.100
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU COME
TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY SATURDAY?

01:29.100 --> 01:30.533
- WELL--

01:30.533 --> 01:31.933
- COME ON,
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

01:31.933 --> 01:33.767
I-I GET TO SAY
WHO'S INVITED

01:33.767 --> 01:36.700
AND...WHO'S NOT.

01:38.933 --> 01:43.000
- JUST SAY THE WORD,
FRANK.

01:44.167 --> 01:45.800
- I'M FIVE.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.100
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

01:47.100 --> 01:49.233
- 22.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.667
- THAT'S OLD.

01:59.567 --> 02:00.567
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON, ERICA.

02:01.533 --> 02:03.033
I WANT TO GET
TO THE LANES EARLY.

02:03.033 --> 02:04.633
THEY ONLY HAVE ONE PAIR
OF SIZE 18 SHOES.

02:04.633 --> 02:06.000
- OKAY.
- BYE!

02:06.000 --> 02:07.200
- IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU ALL.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.367
- TAKE IT EASY.
- NICE MEETING YOU.

02:08.367 --> 02:09.933
BYE.
- HAVE FUN.

02:09.933 --> 02:11.700
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LET'S GO.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.333
- 22?

02:13.333 --> 02:15.467
- HOT DAMN.
- OH.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.333
I DON'T LIKE THAT,
FRANK.

02:21.333 --> 02:22.700
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.300
- WHAT THE HELL'S NOT RIGHT
ABOUT IT?

02:24.300 --> 02:25.967
- WELL, 'CAUSE SHE'S
MUCH TOO YOUNG.

02:25.967 --> 02:27.133
- THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT RIGHT!

02:27.133 --> 02:29.867
- OH.
[scoffs]

02:29.867 --> 02:31.167
STOP IT.

02:31.167 --> 02:32.600
YOUNG WOMEN
GO AFTER OLDER MEN

02:32.600 --> 02:34.600
FOR ONE THING--
SHE'S A GOLD DIGGER.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.400
- MOM, IT'S ROBERT.
COME ON.

02:37.400 --> 02:41.167
WHAT'S SHE AFTER,
HIS VAPORIZER?

02:41.167 --> 02:42.833
- BUT I'M JUST CONCERNED
WITH MY SON,

02:42.833 --> 02:45.800
AND HE'S NOT HELPING BY INVITING
THAT GIRL TO OUR HOUSE.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.000
- AW, COME ON, MARIE.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.433
FIRST, HE SNAGS
THAT ITALIAN NUMBER,

02:49.433 --> 02:50.767
NOW THIS.

02:50.767 --> 02:55.067
ROBERT'S FINALLY DOING STUFF
I CAN BE PROUD OF.

02:55.067 --> 02:57.433
- I'M GOING TO HAVE
A WORD WITH HIM.

02:57.433 --> 02:58.967
- MOM, THEY'RE JUST--
THEY'RE GOING BOWLING.

02:58.967 --> 03:00.200
ALL RIGHT, JUST RELAX.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.700
- OH, PLEASE.
WHY AM I TALKING TO MEN?

03:01.700 --> 03:04.367
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING,
RIGHT, DEBRA?

03:04.367 --> 03:05.800
- WELL, ACTUALLY, MARIE,

03:05.800 --> 03:07.667
I THINK ROBERT SHOULD DO
WHATEVER MAKES HIM HAPPY.

03:07.667 --> 03:11.167
- YEAH,
WHATEVER MAKES HIM HAPPY.

03:11.167 --> 03:14.300
- WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.133
- EVERYBODY SLEEPING?

03:21.133 --> 03:23.267
- ROBERT IS A JERK.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.467
- HUH?

03:26.467 --> 03:30.600
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S DATING A 22-YEAR-OLD.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.133
- WHAT?
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED TO

03:32.133 --> 03:34.233
"WHATEVER MAKES HIM HAPPY"?

03:34.233 --> 03:37.367
- I WAS LYING!

03:39.100 --> 03:42.367
ANYWAY,
THAT'S NOT REAL HAPPINESS.

03:42.367 --> 03:45.700
- I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK IT MIGHT BE.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.100
- COME ON, RAY.

03:47.100 --> 03:50.233
WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT?

03:50.233 --> 03:52.567
- I--
MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE TO TALK.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.733
MAYBE THEY'RE THE--
THEY'RE THE KIND OF COUPLE

03:54.733 --> 03:58.167
THAT DOESN'T HAVE
TO TALK CONSTANTLY.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.733
- I'M SERIOUS, RAY.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.567
- [sighs]

04:11.000 --> 04:13.100
- DO YOU REMEMBER ROBERT'S
FIRST YEAR ON THE FORCE?

04:13.100 --> 04:16.033
REMEMBER WHEN HE HELPED DELIVER
A BABY IN THE BACK OF THAT CAB?

04:16.033 --> 04:17.500
THAT COULD BE ERICA!

04:17.500 --> 04:18.700
- WELL, THAT--

04:18.700 --> 04:20.867
THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT THEY CAN TALK ABOUT.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.467
- NO.

04:22.467 --> 04:25.300
HE CAN'T POSSIBLY BE SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP.

04:25.300 --> 04:26.533
HE'S USING HER.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.500
- HEY, IF THIS BOTHERS YOU
SO MUCH,

04:28.500 --> 04:30.200
WHY DIDN'T YOU SPEAK UP
EARLIER WITH MY MOM?

04:30.200 --> 04:33.533
- BECAUSE IT'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS!

04:33.533 --> 04:36.667
I DON'T WANT TO BE
LIKE YOUR MOTHER!

04:38.600 --> 04:40.733
I'M--I'M SORRY.

04:40.733 --> 04:43.167
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

04:43.167 --> 04:46.467
- TELL THAT TO THE VEIN
IN YOUR HEAD.

04:54.633 --> 04:57.233
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

04:57.233 --> 04:58.333
- IF I SAY YES,

04:58.333 --> 05:01.467
DO YOU STILL
HAVE TO TELL ME?

05:06.867 --> 05:10.233
- I-I THINK THAT ROBERT IS
AFRAID OF INTIMACY,

05:10.233 --> 05:11.733
SO HE GETS INVOLVED
IN A RELATIONSHIP

05:11.733 --> 05:14.300
THAT IS DOOMED
FROM THE BEGINNING.

05:14.300 --> 05:17.433
- YEAH,
BUT WHAT A WAY TO GO.

05:18.633 --> 05:20.633
HEY, COME ON.
NO, MY THING.

05:20.633 --> 05:22.667
- OH, YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S FUNNY, DON'T YOU?

05:22.667 --> 05:25.733
[mockingly]
"WHAT A WAY TO GO."

05:33.433 --> 05:36.733
[sighs]

05:36.733 --> 05:38.467
- HEY.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.200
YOU KNOW,
I REALLY HAVEN'T TOLD YOU

05:40.200 --> 05:43.300
HOW GOOD
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING LATELY.

05:45.367 --> 05:46.967
- WHAT?

05:46.967 --> 05:48.733
- REALLY, THOUGH.

05:48.733 --> 05:51.867
YOU'RE LIKE A--
YOU'RE LIKE A HOT CHICK.

05:51.867 --> 05:54.100
- OH, MY GOD, IS THAT WHAT
YOU THINK THIS IS ABOUT?

05:54.100 --> 05:55.733
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT HOW YOUNG I LOOK?

05:55.733 --> 05:57.467
NO, I AM TALKING
ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG HERE,

05:57.467 --> 05:59.467
A BASIC SENSE
OF DECENCY.

05:59.467 --> 06:01.433
- OKAY,
BUT YOU DO LOOK HOT.

06:01.433 --> 06:04.567
- OH, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.767
- CAN I HAVE THE REMOTE?

06:20.533 --> 06:22.767
OH, YOU'RE HERE.
I CHECKED YOUR APARTMENT.

06:22.767 --> 06:25.800
- YEAH, MA WANTED ME
TO GET AN OLIVE PLATE

06:25.800 --> 06:27.733
FOR DAD'S PARTY.

06:27.733 --> 06:29.333
- WOW, OLIVES.

06:29.333 --> 06:32.133
THIS THING'S GOING TO ROCK.

06:33.733 --> 06:35.400
HEY, SO HOW'S IT GOING
WITH YOU AND ERICA?

06:35.400 --> 06:38.100
- OKAY, I GUESS.
- YEAH, GOOD.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.100
SHE SEEMS TO LIKE YOU.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.233
- YEAH, HOW ABOUT THAT?

06:41.233 --> 06:43.833
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

06:43.833 --> 06:45.600
WELL, IS IT SERIOUS?

06:45.600 --> 06:46.667
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.100
WE'VE ONLY GONE OUT
A FEW TIMES.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.433
- YEAH.

06:49.433 --> 06:51.167
YOU THINK IT'S GOING
TO GET SERIOUS?

06:51.167 --> 06:52.533
- WHO KNOWS?
WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN,

06:52.533 --> 06:54.233
THAT'S ALL.
- WELL, GOOD.

06:54.233 --> 06:56.200
YOU KNOW WHAT
MIGHT BE THE MOST FUN?

06:56.200 --> 06:59.700
BREAKING UP WITH HER.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.667
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:01.667 --> 07:03.733
- LISTEN, IF YOU'RE JUST
HAVING FUN WITH HER,

07:03.733 --> 07:05.500
YOU SHOULDN'T BRING HER
AROUND HERE.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.000
I MEAN, THIS IS WHERE
FUN GOES TO DIE.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.100
- WHAT?
WE HAD FUN HERE.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.300
SHE MADE DAD LAUGH.

07:16.300 --> 07:19.167
- YEAH,
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN GAS.

07:19.167 --> 07:20.500
- YEAH, WELL,
IF IT WAS GAS,

07:20.500 --> 07:24.000
HE NEVER WOULD STOP LAUGHING.
[chuckles]

07:27.100 --> 07:30.233
- LOOK--

07:30.233 --> 07:33.200
IT'S MAKING MY LIFE HELL,
ALL RIGHT?

07:33.200 --> 07:35.467
- MAKING YOUR LIFE HELL?
HOW?

07:35.467 --> 07:40.333
- YOU DATING A YOUNGER GIRL

07:40.333 --> 07:42.033
AFFECTS OTHER PEOPLE,

07:42.033 --> 07:47.400
ESPECIALLY OLDER PEOPLE,
LIKE THE ONE I'M MARRIED TO.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.800
- DEBRA'S NOT OLD.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.233
- SHE IS WHEN ERICA'S
IN THE ROOM.

07:51.233 --> 07:53.267
- YEAH, BUT DEBRA SEEMED
TO LIKE ERICA.

07:53.267 --> 07:55.100
- YEAH, YEAH.
SHE DID, DIDN'T SHE?

07:55.100 --> 07:58.100
SHE WAS PLEASANT,
ENJOYABLE TO BE AROUND.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.300
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, ROBERT,

07:59.300 --> 08:00.633
THERE'S TWO DEBRAS.

08:00.633 --> 08:02.333
THAT'S RIGHT.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.700
THERE'S THE DEBRA
THAT YOU SEE

08:03.700 --> 08:05.433
THAT DOESN'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH IT.

08:05.433 --> 08:06.667
THEN WHEN EVERYBODY LEAVES,

08:06.667 --> 08:09.233
THERE'S THE DEBRA
THAT I SEE--

08:09.233 --> 08:12.367
DARTH DEBRA.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.600
- YEAH, BUT SHE DOESN'T
SEEM SO--

08:18.600 --> 08:20.600
- HEY, HEY, REMEMBER WHEN
YOU BROKE UP WITH AMY?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.367
- YEAH, SHE GOT MAD AT ME,
AND THEN IT WAS OVER.

08:22.367 --> 08:25.000
- OVER FOR YOU
BECAUSE YOU LEFT.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.800
I'M JUST NOW GETTING
MY HEARING BACK.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.033
- REALLY?

08:31.033 --> 08:32.367
- YES, YES.

08:32.367 --> 08:35.800
AND THEN YOU BRING
A 22-YEAR-OLD AROUND.

08:35.800 --> 08:39.133
I'M GOING TO BE
A LONELY, DEAF, SEX BEGGAR.

08:45.467 --> 08:47.833
- SO YOU'RE SERIOUS?

08:47.833 --> 08:49.500
THERE'S TWO DEBRAS?

08:49.500 --> 08:51.233
- YEP.

08:51.233 --> 08:54.367
AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM
CAN COOK.

08:58.733 --> 09:01.267
SO LOOK, I MEAN--

09:01.267 --> 09:03.500
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
JUST BE COOL.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.567
I MEAN, HAVE FUN,
BUT...

09:06.567 --> 09:10.500
JUST HAVE IT
AWAY FROM HERE.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.533
- ALL RIGHT, RAYMOND.
I-I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

09:12.533 --> 09:14.700
- THANK YOU, MAN.
THANK YOU.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.033
HEY, IF IT WAS UP TO ME,

09:16.033 --> 09:17.300
YOU COULD PARADE HER
AROUND HERE NAKED.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.433
I WOULDN'T SAY, "BOO."

09:22.200 --> 09:23.433
I WOULDN'T MIND
AT ALL--

09:23.433 --> 09:26.567
- I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND.
- OKAY.

09:29.367 --> 09:31.700
- FRANK,
DON'T EAT THAT CAKE.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.333
- WHAT? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU YELLING ABOUT?

09:33.333 --> 09:35.200
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

09:35.200 --> 09:36.800
THAT'S FOR THE PARTY.

09:36.800 --> 09:37.967
- IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

09:37.967 --> 09:41.700
LOOK AT THE NAME THERE.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.900
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.

09:44.900 --> 09:47.000
- ROBERT.
- HEY, RAYMOND.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.567
I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER ERICA.

09:48.567 --> 09:51.633
- YEAH, I SURE DO,
THE BOWLER.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.967
- HI, RAY.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.533
- HELLO THERE, ERICA.

09:54.533 --> 09:58.300
SO, UH,
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.233
- OH, HELLO, ERICA.

10:05.233 --> 10:07.233
I'M SO GLAD
YOU COULD MAKE IT.

10:07.233 --> 10:11.533
WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING
TO DRINK, MAYBE SOME MILK?

10:11.533 --> 10:13.300
- OH, NO, THANKS.
I'M FINE.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.767
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD.
THAT'S FROM ME AND ERICA.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.567
- WHY, THANK YOU, ERICA.

10:18.567 --> 10:21.533
THIS IS VERY THOUGHTFUL
OF YOU.

10:21.533 --> 10:24.767
-[speaking loudly]
FRANK, IT'S TIME TO SIT.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.567
I MADE YOU A CAKE.

10:27.567 --> 10:31.033
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME HELP
GETTING INTO YOUR SEAT?

10:31.967 --> 10:33.300
- [laughs]

10:33.300 --> 10:34.767
MY WIFE MAKES A JOKE.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.000
HERE, ERICA, COME.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.133
YOU CAN SIT
BY THE MAN OF THE HOUR.

10:41.567 --> 10:43.800
- WHAT THE HELL, MAN?
DEBRA'S GOING TO BE RIGHT BACK.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.133
- AW, COME ON, RAYMOND.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.533
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR STORY,
TWO DEBRAS.

10:47.533 --> 10:49.867
ALL I SEE IS
ONE JEALOUS BROTHER.

10:49.867 --> 10:51.433
- WHAT?
I'M NOT JEALOUS OF YOU.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?
I WAS TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

10:53.367 --> 10:54.667
- WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE TRUTH.

10:54.667 --> 10:56.433
I HAPPEN TO BE GOING OUT
WITH A WONDERFUL,

10:56.433 --> 11:00.533
TERRIFIC YOUNG WOMAN
AND NA-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.733
- HEY, HI, ERICA.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.567
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HOW ARE YOU?

11:06.567 --> 11:08.133
- HI, DEBRA. FINE.
HOW ARE YOU?

11:08.133 --> 11:09.333
- I'M GOOD, THANKS.
HEY, ROBERT.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.167
- HEY, DEB.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.300
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

11:16.333 --> 11:17.767
- I'M NOT SITTING
NEXT TO THEM.

11:17.767 --> 11:21.633
I DON'T NEED TO WATCH ROBERT
CUT HER MEAT.

11:21.633 --> 11:24.300
- ERICA, WHAT IS THAT
HEAVENLY SCENT YOU'RE WEARING?

11:24.300 --> 11:26.167
LET ME GUESS WHAT IT IS.

11:26.167 --> 11:27.333
- ALL RIGHT, FRANK.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.267
WE DON'T SNIFF THE GUESTS.

11:30.267 --> 11:31.700
- I'M HAVING A CONVERSATION.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.100
- OH, YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.433
- AND YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING ME.

11:34.433 --> 11:38.633
PEOPLE THINK I'M WITH YOU.

11:38.633 --> 11:39.900
- YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

11:39.900 --> 11:42.333
- THERE'S A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.067
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, FRANK.

11:44.067 --> 11:48.033
YOU ARE NOW OFFICIALLY
A DIRTY OLD MAN.

11:48.033 --> 11:49.333
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH THAT?

11:49.333 --> 11:50.800
- YOU DON'T DESERVE MY FOOD.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.967
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
I STAY AROUND HERE FOR?

11:52.967 --> 11:54.167
I'LL GO TO THE LODGE!

11:54.167 --> 11:55.800
- GOOD! GO!
- I'M GOING!

11:55.800 --> 11:58.133
- GOOD!
- GOOD-BYE!

11:58.133 --> 11:59.667
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
ERICA.

12:07.800 --> 12:08.867
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, MA?

12:08.867 --> 12:10.667
WE CAN EAT THAT.

12:10.667 --> 12:14.833
- YOU?
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.667
- OH, MY GOD,
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.767
MAYBE I SHOULD GO.
- NO, NO, DON'T.

12:18.767 --> 12:20.333
IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU'RE HERE, RIGHT?

12:20.333 --> 12:23.100
- SURE.
NO, IT'S NOT YOU, ERICA.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.067
WELL, SHOOT,
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD

12:25.067 --> 12:27.133
TO GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.333
- HEY, HERE'S AN IDEA.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.167
WE CAN ALL GO OUT TO DINNER.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.200
- UM--
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.867
- YEAH.
HEY, WE'LL GO TO NEMO'S.

12:33.867 --> 12:35.000
- YOU LIKE NEMO'S,
DEBRA?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.233
- SURE.
- GREAT.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.600
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GET THE CAR.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.067
- OKAY.

12:39.067 --> 12:40.367
- HEY, UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:40.367 --> 12:42.000
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO
WITHOUT ME?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.800
'CAUSE I'M--I'M REALLY NOT
FEELING GOOD HERE.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.700
- OKAY, WELL, COME ON, DEBRA,
LET'S GO.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.633
- OKAY.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.533
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, RAY?

12:50.533 --> 12:52.100
YOU HAVE, LIKE,
A SORE THROAT OR SOMETHING?

12:52.100 --> 12:53.933
- I GOT--IT'S PROBABLY--
- GET IN THE CAR!

12:53.933 --> 12:55.033
- AAH, AAH, AAH.

12:55.033 --> 12:56.833
ROBERT!
ROBERT, LOOK!

12:56.833 --> 12:58.767
LOOK! LOOK!

13:03.667 --> 13:05.600
- SEE, IT'S A NICE PLACE,
RIGHT?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.533
NO PARENTS.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.067
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LOOK,

13:10.067 --> 13:11.800
WHY DON'T WE ALL
CHECK OUT THE MENUS?

13:11.800 --> 13:14.800
AND IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GOING TO HIT THE BATHROOM.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.100
- OH, YEAH.
ME TOO.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.667
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.400
WELL, YOU DIDN'T LET ME
GO WHEN WE WERE AT THE HOUSE.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.533
- RAY.
- I HAVE TO GO.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.200
- ROBERT'S REALLY SWEET, HUH?

13:36.200 --> 13:38.333
- MM-HMM.

13:41.267 --> 13:43.167
- SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU AND RAY BEEN MARRIED?

13:43.167 --> 13:46.600
- OH, GOSH,
GOING ON 11 YEARS.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.667
- WOW.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.267
THAT'S GREAT.

13:51.267 --> 13:54.400
- YEP,
I'M A LUCKY WOMAN.

13:59.067 --> 14:01.733
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

14:01.733 --> 14:03.433
IT'S JUST THAT
YOU'VE BEEN SO NICE TO ME,

14:03.433 --> 14:06.833
AND YOU'RE SO EXPERIENCED.

14:06.833 --> 14:10.367
- THANK YOU.

14:10.367 --> 14:13.533
- SO...ROBERT'S MOTHER.

14:13.533 --> 14:14.967
SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME,
DOES SHE?

14:14.967 --> 14:16.867
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
SURE, SHE DOES.

14:16.867 --> 14:18.733
- NO.
I CAN TELL.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.633
IT'S BECAUSE
I'M TOO YOUNG, RIGHT?

14:21.633 --> 14:22.700
- UH--

14:22.700 --> 14:24.767
- SEE, THAT'S WHY
I LIKE ROBERT

14:24.767 --> 14:27.333
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY AGE.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.533
- YEAH, ROBERT'S TERRIFIC
THAT WAY.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.700
- I HOPE HE REALLY IS
BECAUSE, YOU SEE,

14:35.700 --> 14:37.967
ACTUALLY...

14:37.967 --> 14:40.100
I'M 19.

14:41.967 --> 14:45.067
- WHAT?

14:45.067 --> 14:48.667
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS INSANE.

14:48.667 --> 14:49.867
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:49.867 --> 14:51.533
- I MEAN, YOU'RE BARELY
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

14:51.533 --> 14:54.533
YOU ARE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL,
AREN'T YOU?

14:54.533 --> 14:56.233
- WELL, YEAH,
FOR OVER A YEAR.

14:56.233 --> 14:58.333
- OH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

14:58.333 --> 15:01.300
SORRY, IT'S JUST THAT--

15:01.300 --> 15:04.400
MY GOD,
YOU'RE A TEENAGER!

15:09.433 --> 15:13.600
- ALL RIGHT,
LET THE FUN BEGIN.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.300
I'M SO HUNGRY,
I'M GOING TO ORDER

15:15.300 --> 15:17.300
A PIZZA TOPPED
WITH ANOTHER PIZZA.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.200
[chuckles]
RIGHT?

15:22.233 --> 15:24.833
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

15:24.833 --> 15:27.367
- FINE.

15:27.367 --> 15:29.500
- ERICA?

15:29.500 --> 15:31.433
- UM, I'M NOT REALLY HUNGRY.

15:31.433 --> 15:33.033
- HEY, I'M NOT HUNGRY EITHER.
LET'S JUST GO.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.633
YOU WANT TO GO?
- YEP.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.800
- WAIT, ERICA, DON'T LET
MY PARENTS RUIN YOUR EVENING.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.733
- IT'S NOT YOUR PARENTS.

15:40.733 --> 15:41.867
- WHAT IS IT?

15:41.867 --> 15:44.033
IS IT RAYMOND?

15:44.033 --> 15:45.600
- NO.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.033
- UM, ERICA'S
JUST A LITTLE UPSET

15:48.033 --> 15:49.833
BECAUSE, UM,

15:49.833 --> 15:53.000
SHE'S AFRAID TO TELL YOU
THAT SHE'S 19.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.200
- [gagging]

16:17.867 --> 16:19.500
- YOU'RE 19?

16:19.500 --> 16:21.733
- OH, MAN.

16:21.733 --> 16:24.567
THAT IS SHOCKING.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.467
- I'M SORRY, ROBERT.
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.

16:26.467 --> 16:29.633
BUT I WAS AFRAID THAT
YOU WOULDN'T GO OUT WITH ME.

16:29.633 --> 16:32.533
- 19?

16:32.533 --> 16:35.200
- THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.833
- COME ON, SO INSTEAD
OF A 13-YEAR DIFFERENCE,

16:37.833 --> 16:40.567
IT'S 16, BUT IT'S STILL
JUST A NUMBER.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.700
- WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE.
16 YEARS?

16:42.700 --> 16:45.067
THAT WOULD MAKE ROBERT 35.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.733
- RIGHT.

16:46.733 --> 16:49.033
- [laughs]

16:49.033 --> 16:52.167
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

16:53.567 --> 16:55.500
- WHAT?

16:57.767 --> 17:01.667
ROBERT, YOU'RE NOT 35?

17:01.667 --> 17:03.033
- I'M 40.

17:03.033 --> 17:04.733
- ROBERT.
- 3.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.667
- 43.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.267
- OH.

17:10.267 --> 17:11.700
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
BUT, ERICA, YOU KNOW,

17:11.700 --> 17:14.867
LIKE YOU SAID,
IT'S JUST A NUMBER, RIGHT?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.433
- YEAH,

17:16.433 --> 17:19.567
BUT THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.

17:21.233 --> 17:23.367
- 35?
HOW OLD DID HE SAY I WAS?

17:23.367 --> 17:26.333
- RAY, NOT NOW.
- 37.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.800
- YOU MADE ME
OLDER THAN YOU?

17:28.800 --> 17:30.267
- I THINK I'D BETTER GO.

17:30.267 --> 17:33.333
- W-W--
NO, WAIT.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.767
ERICA,
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

17:34.767 --> 17:36.767
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:36.767 --> 17:38.400
I'LL CALL YOU, ROBERT.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.767
- HEY, I'M YOUNGER THAN HIM.

17:39.767 --> 17:43.200
I'M HIS YOUNGER BROTHER.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.700
- I'LL BE SURPRISED
IF SHE CALLS.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.367
- SORRY, ROBERT.

17:51.367 --> 17:53.500
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU ENJOYED THAT.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.800
- ENJOYED WHAT?
- DESTROYING MY RELATIONSHIP.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.533
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY
ADD TWO NUMBERS SO FAST.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.800
- THAT WASN'T
A RELATIONSHIP.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.367
THAT WAS TWO PEOPLE
LYING ABOUT THEIR AGE.

18:06.367 --> 18:08.600
- AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM
HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT

18:08.600 --> 18:10.767
UNTIL YOU BUTTED IN.

18:10.767 --> 18:12.233
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT, RAY.

18:12.233 --> 18:15.333
SHE IS THREATENED
BY YOUNGER WOMEN.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.667
- RAY TOLD YOU THAT?

18:16.667 --> 18:19.300
- NO WAY.
NO WAY.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.533
- WELL, I AM NOT THREATENED
BY YOUNGER WOMEN.

18:22.533 --> 18:23.567
WHY SHOULD I BE?

18:23.567 --> 18:25.100
I HAPPEN TO BE
AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.600
- AMEN TO THAT.
- I AM EXTREMELY WELL-READ.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.867
I AM A GOOD CONVERSATIONALIST.
- HALLELUJAH.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.967
- I'M PROUD OF MY AGE,
AND I HAVE NEVER LIED ABOUT IT.

18:30.967 --> 18:32.467
- NO REASON TO.
- SHUT UP, RAY.

18:32.467 --> 18:33.967
- ALL RIGHT.

18:33.967 --> 18:35.467
- SO WHAT IS IT NOW,

18:35.467 --> 18:37.133
MEN HAVE TO DATE WOMEN
20 YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEY ARE?

18:37.133 --> 18:39.567
IF RAY DIES TOMORROW, I HAVE
TO START DATING 60-YEAR-OLDS?

18:39.567 --> 18:44.267
- WHOA, I'M DYING TOMORROW?
- WE'LL SEE.

18:44.267 --> 18:47.733
AND FACE IT, ROBERT,
YOU'RE MIDDLE-AGED. HMM?

18:47.733 --> 18:49.333
DID SHE REALLY
MAKE YOU FEEL YOUNGER?

18:49.333 --> 18:51.967
- YES, SHE DID,
AND I LIKED BEING WITH HER.

18:51.967 --> 18:53.733
WHENEVER WE'D GO OUT,
WE'D GET IN THE CAR,

18:53.733 --> 18:55.167
AND IT FELT GREAT.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.900
SHE'D PUT ON THE RADIO,
AND SHE'D TUNE IN

18:56.900 --> 18:59.033
TO ONE OF HER STATIONS
WITH THAT REALLY JAMMIN' MUSIC.

18:59.033 --> 19:00.600
- OH, AND YOU LIKED THAT?
YOU LIKED THE JAMMIN'?

19:00.600 --> 19:03.133
- ACTUALLY, IT WAS
A LITTLE LOUD FOR ME,

19:03.133 --> 19:04.600
BUT THAT WAS
A BAD EXAMPLE.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.867
- OKAY, FINE, GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.

19:06.867 --> 19:10.200
I'M WAITING FOR THE PART
WHERE YOU'RE YOUNGER.

19:13.133 --> 19:16.800
LOOK, ROBERT,
I KNOW YOU GET LONELY,

19:16.800 --> 19:19.700
BUT DIDN'T YOU FEEL
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE

19:19.700 --> 19:22.633
BEING WITH THAT GIRL?

19:24.800 --> 19:27.033
- SHE LIKED ME.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.533
IT WAS FLATTERING.

19:29.533 --> 19:32.600
SHE WANTED TO TALK TO ME
FOR HOURS.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.000
THE TRUTH IS,
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE

19:34.000 --> 19:37.300
ENOUGH PHONE STAMINA
FOR HER.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.933
DID YOU--DID YOU SEE THE WAY
SHE LOOKED AT ME

19:47.933 --> 19:50.367
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT
I WAS 43?

19:50.367 --> 19:53.500
LIKE I JUST SAT UP
OUT OF A COFFIN.

19:56.533 --> 19:59.533
- THAT GIRL WAS LESS
THAN HALF OUR AGE.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.833
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH WITH THE NUMBERS ALREADY.

20:01.833 --> 20:05.133
YOU'RE KILLING ME!

20:05.133 --> 20:07.800
- DID SHE REALLY THINK
I WAS OLDER THAN YOU?

20:07.800 --> 20:10.700
- DIDN'T BAT AN EYE.

20:14.033 --> 20:15.233
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

20:15.233 --> 20:19.467
LET'S JUST ORDER,
ALL RIGHT?

20:19.467 --> 20:23.333
LET'S GET THE PIZZA
WITH SAUSAGE AND ONIONS.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.433
- ONIONS?
WHAT TIME IS IT?

20:25.433 --> 20:29.967
OH, NO, I CAN'T DO ONIONS
AFTER 8:00.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.600
- IT'S OKAY.
I GOT THE TUMS.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.333
- OH, TUMS ARE GOOD.
THEY HAVE CALCIUM.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.833
