WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:05.471
ALL RIGHT.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.307
WHAT, WHAT
IS THIS?

00:07.373 --> 00:09.576
CHICKEN LEG, CHICKEN...

00:09.643 --> 00:12.212
I ORDERED CHICKEN WINGS,
NOT CHICKEN LEGS.

00:12.278 --> 00:16.416
WELL, NEITHER DID MAX,
BUT THAT'S WHAT GOD GAVE HER.

00:17.383 --> 00:19.252
LET ME STIR THAT FOR YOU.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.994
HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.

00:28.061 --> 00:30.897
BUT I WAS DETAINED BY
AN AMOROUS METER MAID.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.366
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO
REFUSE A PHONE NUMBER

00:33.433 --> 00:34.868
WHEN IT'S WRITTEN

00:34.935 --> 00:37.270
ON THE BACK OF
YOUR PARKING TICKET.

00:37.337 --> 00:40.206
SO THEY'RE GIVING OUT
TICKETS FOR UGLY NOW, HUH?

00:40.273 --> 00:42.876
OH, POOR MAXINE.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.177
JUST JEALOUS

00:44.244 --> 00:46.547
BECAUSE THE LAST
PHONE NUMBER SHE GOT

00:46.613 --> 00:49.149
WAS TO A PAY PHONE
AT RIKERS.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.417
WHEN DID YOU CUT OFF
THE GUYS AT ATTICA?

00:51.484 --> 00:52.986
( laughing )

00:53.053 --> 00:54.487
WAIT, WAIT. HOLD UP.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.924
IF MAX HASN'T GONE OUT ON A DATE
IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS

00:57.991 --> 01:00.126
IT'S BECAUSE
SHE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT.

01:00.193 --> 01:01.735
THANK YOU, KHADIJAH.

01:01.802 --> 01:03.336
'COURSE IF SHE DID FEEL LIKE IT

01:03.403 --> 01:05.405
IT WOULDN'T MATTER
'CAUSE NOBODY CALLS.

01:05.471 --> 01:08.608
I DON'T NEED NOBODY
TO CALL ME.

01:08.675 --> 01:11.778
I CAN GET AS MANY NUMBERS
AS I WANT WHENEVER I WANT.

01:11.845 --> 01:12.946
UH‐UH.

01:13.013 --> 01:14.815
BATHROOMS WALLS
DO NOT COUNT.

01:14.881 --> 01:17.518
I ALREADY GOT
YOUR NUMBER, KYLE.

01:19.385 --> 01:21.888
LOOK, PICK ANY MAN IN HERE‐‐

01:21.955 --> 01:23.624
I'LL GET THE DIGITS.

01:23.690 --> 01:25.526
OH, JUST PAVING
YOUR OWN ROAD

01:25.592 --> 01:27.293
TO HUMILIATION,
AREN'T YOU?

01:27.360 --> 01:28.629
ALL RIGHT.

01:28.695 --> 01:30.030
UH...

01:31.297 --> 01:32.498
HUH...

01:32.566 --> 01:34.568
THE WAITER‐‐
JUNIOR RIGHT THERE.

01:35.902 --> 01:37.838
PEEP THE TECHNIQUE.

01:41.141 --> 01:42.743
OH.

01:47.981 --> 01:49.883
YEAH, UM,
MAX IS THE NAME.

01:49.950 --> 01:51.451
NICE APRON.

01:51.518 --> 01:53.119
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU

01:53.186 --> 01:54.588
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE NUMBER

01:54.655 --> 01:56.723
AND, UH,
I'LL CALL YOU SOMETIME.

01:56.790 --> 01:58.424
SORRY, BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED.

01:58.491 --> 02:00.060
OH, YOU MARRIED?

02:00.126 --> 02:00.767
NO.

02:00.834 --> 02:01.635
GAY?

02:01.702 --> 02:02.536
NO.

02:02.603 --> 02:03.369
NO PHONE?

02:03.436 --> 02:04.404
EXCUSE ME.

02:04.470 --> 02:05.906
THOSE FOLKS ARE WAITING

02:05.972 --> 02:07.307
FOR THEIR GAZPACHO.

02:18.552 --> 02:20.320
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

I DON'T WANT HIM OFFENDED
BY THIS VIOLENCE.

03:04.270 --> 03:06.607
SYNCLAIRE, HE'S TAKING
THE SUBWAY OVER.

03:06.673 --> 03:09.810
IF HE MAKES IT HERE IN ONE PIECE
I'M SURE HE'LL BE RELIEVED

03:09.876 --> 03:12.078
TO SEE CHARLES BRONSON'S
ANGELIC FACE.

03:13.079 --> 03:15.215

JUMPING THE BROOM

ON THE SUBWAY.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.294
WELL, THANK
YOU, REVEREND

03:28.361 --> 03:29.796
AND WE'RE
REALLY HONORED

03:29.863 --> 03:32.132
THAT YOU AGREED TO
PERFORM THE CEREMONY.

03:32.198 --> 03:35.168
WELL, AS MOSES SAID
TO THE BURNING BUSH

03:35.235 --> 03:37.470
"IT'S GOING TO BE HOT!"

03:37.538 --> 03:38.805
YOU SEE? YES.

03:38.872 --> 03:40.440
I'M GOING
TO HAVE A SEAT.

03:40.507 --> 03:43.644
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
THE WEDDING DATE AND THE VOWS

03:43.710 --> 03:45.812
AND, OF COURSE, THE EXAM.

03:45.879 --> 03:48.148
OH, EXAM... WELL, UH...

03:48.214 --> 03:50.416
I JUST HAD A PHYSICAL.

03:50.483 --> 03:53.654
MM‐MM. AND THE DOCTOR SAID
THAT HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYONE

03:53.720 --> 03:55.522
AT MY FITNESS LEVEL
MORE FIT THAN I AM.

03:55.589 --> 03:57.090

03:57.157 --> 03:58.592
NO, SYNCLAIRE.

03:58.659 --> 04:01.401
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WRITTEN
COMPATIBILITY TEST.

04:01.467 --> 04:02.936
OH, COME ON, REVEREND.

04:03.003 --> 04:04.671
YOU KNOW THAT
SYNCLAIRE AND I

04:04.738 --> 04:07.440
ARE MORE COMPATIBLE THAN
CORN DOGS AND COOL WHIP.

04:08.509 --> 04:11.011
IT MAKES A NICE
LITTLE PICK‐ME‐UP.

04:11.077 --> 04:13.046
WELL, YOU SEE, SON,
IT'S NOT UP TO ME.

04:13.113 --> 04:15.882
THE CHURCH REQUIRES THAT
ALL COUPLES PASS THIS TEST

04:15.949 --> 04:17.817
BEFORE I'M ALLOWED
TO MARRY THEM.

04:17.884 --> 04:19.720
WELL, I'M SURE
WE'LL PASS THE TEST

04:19.786 --> 04:21.755
JUST LIKE YOU
AND MRS. TAYLOR DID.

04:21.822 --> 04:25.325
WELL, THIS EXAM WASN'T AROUND
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED.

04:25.391 --> 04:28.094
WE HAD A MUCH MORE
DIFFICULT TEST.

04:28.161 --> 04:29.730
OH, WHAT WAS THAT?

04:29.796 --> 04:30.731
WELL, SYNCLAIRE...

04:30.797 --> 04:31.732
( chuckling )

04:31.798 --> 04:34.534
ME AND THE MISSUS MET
IN 1978.

04:34.601 --> 04:37.403
YOU SEE, SHE DUG BARRY WHITE

04:37.470 --> 04:40.406
AND I GROOVED
TO BARRY GIBB.

04:40.473 --> 04:42.408
YEAH.

04:42.475 --> 04:45.779
DIDN'T EVER THINK THAT
WE'D SEE EYE TO EYE.

04:45.846 --> 04:47.548
THEN CAME SALVATION‐‐

04:47.614 --> 04:49.516
THE WALKMAN...

04:49.583 --> 04:51.317
AND HIS AND HER HEADPHONES.

I TELL YOU,
THE LORD AND THE JAPANESE

04:55.388 --> 04:57.791
WORK IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

04:57.858 --> 04:59.492
WELL, WELL...

04:59.560 --> 05:00.801
ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.268
HERE'S THE DEAL.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.104
THE WAITER'S NAME
IS TIM MATTHEWS.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.707
LAST TWO YEARS,
HE'S DATED FIVE WOMEN

05:06.773 --> 05:09.075
AND THERE IS NO HISTORY
OF MENTAL ILLNESS IN HIS FAMILY.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.779
WELL, HONEY,
THERE GO YOUR CHANCES.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.482
YOU ARE BUGGIN'.
HE'S NOT EVEN YOUR TYPE.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.051
WHO SAID THIS IS ABOUT HIM?

05:18.118 --> 05:20.020
MAXINE SHAW
DOES NOT ACCEPT DEFEAT‐‐

05:20.086 --> 05:23.156
NOT IN THE COURTROOM
AND CERTAINLY NOT IN A BARROOM.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.225
TO ME, REJECTION IS
ABOUT AS NATURAL

05:25.291 --> 05:27.794
AS THAT THING
ON REGINE'S HEAD.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.400
JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T GROW IT

05:34.467 --> 05:37.270
DOESN'T MAKE IT
ANY LESS NATURAL.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.040
SYNCLAIRE, YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:40.106 --> 05:42.042
YOU USED OUR SPECIAL
EMERGENCY PAGE.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.844
I THOUGHT
WE WERE ONLY USING THAT

05:43.910 --> 05:45.211
IN CASE OF NUCLEAR ATTACK

05:45.278 --> 05:48.081
OR IF YOU GOT YOUR HEAD
STUCK IN THE BANISTER AGAIN.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.416
WE HAVE TO STUDY
FOR REVEREND TAYLOR'S TEST.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.119
I BORROWED ALL REGINE'S
RELATIONSHIP BOOKS. COME ON.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.389
SYNCLAIRE, IT'S NOT THE KIND
OF TEST YOU STUDY FOR.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.559
THEN WHY IS THERE
A SAMPLE TEST IN HERE?

05:58.625 --> 06:00.734
LOOK AT THIS‐‐
QUESTION NUMBER ONE:

06:00.801 --> 06:02.836
WE'RE EMBROILED
IN A HEATED DEBATE

06:02.903 --> 06:04.705
OVER A DEEP
PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUE.

06:04.771 --> 06:06.239
WHAT DO WE DO?

06:06.306 --> 06:07.741
GO.

06:07.808 --> 06:09.976
AGREE THAT THE FIRST
LIONEL JEFFERSON

06:10.043 --> 06:12.713
WAS THE BEST AND PRESS ON.

06:12.779 --> 06:14.380
AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED

06:14.447 --> 06:17.651
THERE ARE ONLY THREE
COMPATIBILITY QUESTIONS

06:17.718 --> 06:19.052
THAT TRULY MATTER.

06:19.119 --> 06:22.055
DO YOU LOVE REGINE?

06:24.024 --> 06:27.427
WOULD YOU DIE
FOR REGINE?

06:27.493 --> 06:29.262
IF YOU DID DIE

06:29.329 --> 06:34.367
WOULD REGINE BE TAKEN
CARE OF FINANCIALLY?

06:40.273 --> 06:44.511
AND WOULD SHE RECEIVE
PSYCHOTHERAPY...

06:44.578 --> 06:48.582
TO KEEP HER FROM TALKING
TO MANNEQUINS?

06:49.816 --> 06:50.917
COME ON,
SYNCLAIRE.

06:50.984 --> 06:53.286
THIS TEST
IS A GIMME.

06:53.353 --> 06:55.856
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS AS SMOOTH
AS GRANDPA JONES' MOONSHINE.

06:55.922 --> 06:57.924
UH, SMOOTHER, ACTUALLY.

06:57.991 --> 07:00.527
YOU NEVER MADE ME COUGH.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.235
WELL, I THINK
WE SHOULD STUDY.

07:02.302 --> 07:03.604
RIGHT, KHADIJAH?

07:03.670 --> 07:04.905
I DON'T KNOW.

07:04.971 --> 07:07.373
I'M STILL WORKING ON
THAT LIONEL JEFFERSON THING.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.442
THE SECOND ONE COULDN'T ACT

07:09.510 --> 07:11.444
BUT THE FIRST ONE
HAD THAT FUNKY 'FRO.

07:13.346 --> 07:16.683
ALL RIGHT, OBIE,
TIME FOR CHAPTER 27.

07:16.750 --> 07:19.385
"THE HONEYMOON'S OVER,
THE SCRATCHING BEGINS."

07:19.452 --> 07:21.021
COME ON, SYNCLAIRE.

07:21.087 --> 07:22.956
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS
FOR TWO DAYS.

07:23.023 --> 07:25.926
YESTERDAY I SPENT
THREE HOURS BEING QUIZZED

07:25.992 --> 07:29.395
ON THE FATHER'S ROLE IN
BREAST‐FEEDING IN PUBLIC.

07:29.462 --> 07:32.432
I MEAN, AT THIS POINT,
I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY MYSELF.

07:32.498 --> 07:35.068
LET'S TAKE A BREAK, OKAY?

07:35.135 --> 07:37.070
YES, YES, MY DARLING.

07:37.137 --> 07:38.404
HI, PEOPLE.

07:42.776 --> 07:45.078
MAX, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO EAT WITH US

07:45.145 --> 07:47.147
BUT BY THE LOOKS
OF THAT DRESS

07:47.213 --> 07:49.415
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO PICK SOMETHING UP.

07:49.482 --> 07:51.852
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

07:51.918 --> 07:53.920
( chuckling )

07:56.089 --> 07:57.624
ALL RIGHT.

08:03.069 --> 08:04.337
MAX...

08:04.404 --> 08:07.207
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT GUY'S WORTH YOUR

08:07.273 --> 08:09.475
"PEEL ME LIKE
A BANANA" DRESS?

08:09.543 --> 08:10.844
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING:

08:10.911 --> 08:16.116
"TANTALIZING IS THE TAPEWORM
THAT SCORNS THE BELLY."

08:20.954 --> 08:23.790
MAX ONLY WANTS HIM
BECAUSE SHE CAN'T HAVE HIM.

08:23.857 --> 08:25.458
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

08:25.526 --> 08:27.794
TIM IS A MAN
ON HIS WAY UP.

08:27.861 --> 08:31.532
AS SOON AS THE FRY COOK DIES,
HE'S THE MAN.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.366
HELLO, TIM.

08:33.433 --> 08:34.400
OH, HI.

08:34.467 --> 08:35.902
UH... UH...

08:35.969 --> 08:37.236
MAX. MAX. MAX. MAX.

08:37.303 --> 08:38.270
RIGHT.

08:38.337 --> 08:39.740
MAX.

08:39.806 --> 08:41.808
UH, WHAT CAN
I GET FOR YOU?

08:41.875 --> 08:44.911
OKAY, I WILL HAVE
A CHEESEBURGER

08:44.978 --> 08:47.113
AND YOUR PHONE NUMBER.

08:47.180 --> 08:49.883
OKAY, WE GOT
ONE CHEESEBURGER...

08:49.950 --> 08:52.318
AND ONE NO CHANCE.

08:56.056 --> 08:57.323
HEY, LOOK, COME ON.

08:57.390 --> 08:59.459
LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE

08:59.526 --> 09:00.767
ALL RIGHT?

09:00.834 --> 09:02.969
I'M A LAWYER,
I LOOK LIKE THIS

09:03.036 --> 09:04.905
I'M AVAILABLE.

09:04.971 --> 09:07.340
DO THE RIGHT THING, MAN.

09:07.407 --> 09:09.743
NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU'RE
JUST A LITTLE BIT

09:09.810 --> 09:11.211
TOO AGGRESSIVE FOR ME.

09:11.277 --> 09:12.378
TOO AGGRESSIVE?

09:12.445 --> 09:14.380
YEAH.

09:14.447 --> 09:16.650
WELL, I CAN BE
VERY LAID BACK

09:16.717 --> 09:18.752
UH, VERY CASUAL.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.623
LET'S GO DANCING.
I'LL LET YOU LEAD.

09:22.689 --> 09:24.290
SURE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

09:24.357 --> 09:25.559
YOU CAN WATCH ME...

09:25.626 --> 09:27.060
DO "THE RUNNING MAN."

09:30.463 --> 09:34.367
NOW HOMER WILL SCRAPE
GUM FROM UNDER A TABLE

09:34.434 --> 09:36.970
BUT HE WON'T
GO OUT WITH YOU.

09:38.972 --> 09:41.274
I LIKE HIM.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.151
OH, CHECK THIS OUT.

09:51.217 --> 09:54.187
THEY GOT RELIGIOUS
ARCHIE COMICS NOW...

09:54.254 --> 09:57.223
AND JUGHEAD'S PASSING OUT
THE COMMUNION

09:57.290 --> 09:59.459
AND I'LL BE DAMNED...

10:01.101 --> 10:03.303
( quietly ):
I'LL BE DAMNED IF BIG ETHYL

10:03.369 --> 10:04.871
AIN'T LEADING THE CHOIR.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.773
OH, HELLO, MRS. TAYLOR.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.908
HELLO, DEAR.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.076
MY HUSBAND ASKED
ME TO TELL YOU

10:10.143 --> 10:12.078
IT'S GOING TO BE
A FEW MORE MOMENTS.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.446
HE'S BAPTIZING
QUINTUPLETS

10:13.514 --> 10:14.815
AND RAN OUT OF WATER.

10:15.916 --> 10:16.917
OOH, <i>ARCHIE.</i>

10:16.983 --> 10:18.852
ISN'T IT INSPIRING
HOW MOOSE

10:18.919 --> 10:21.522
FINDS THE MISSING
COLLECTION BASKETS?

10:23.990 --> 10:28.629
EH, WHAT'S A COMIC BOOK
WITHOUT SUSPENSE?

10:28.695 --> 10:31.131
YOU SHOULD BE STUDYING ANYWAY.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.899
SYNCLAIRE, MY BRAIN IS FULL.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.570
NOW I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE
YOUR MENOPAUSE, MY MENOPAUSE

10:36.637 --> 10:38.705
AND HOW TO KEEP
THE PILLOW TALK ALIVE

10:38.772 --> 10:42.408
IF WE BOTH GET STRUCK
DEAF OR DUMB.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.678
BUT, OBIE, WHAT IF THERE'S
A HIDDEN FLAW

10:44.745 --> 10:45.979
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP?

10:46.046 --> 10:49.983
SYNCLAIRE, IF I'M UNDERSTANDING
YOU CORRECTLY‐‐

10:50.050 --> 10:52.085
WHICH IS NEVER A GIVEN‐‐

10:52.152 --> 10:53.253
UM...

10:53.319 --> 10:54.988
YOU'RE HAVING DOUBTS
ABOUT US?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.489
MAYBE I'D BE MORE CONFIDENT

10:56.557 --> 10:58.859
IF YOU TOOK THIS TEST
AS SERIOUSLY AS I DO.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.702
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU HAD MORE
FAITH IN OUR RELATIONSHIP

11:01.768 --> 11:03.937
YOU WOULDN'T TAKE
THIS TEST SO SERIOUSLY.

11:04.004 --> 11:06.172
AHH, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:06.239 --> 11:08.542
YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK

11:08.609 --> 11:10.644
TO READING YOUR COMIC BOOK

11:10.711 --> 11:13.814
AND FIND OUT IF BETTY
GETS MARRIED TO PIGPEN.

11:15.415 --> 11:17.918
PIGPEN'S A "PEANUT"...

11:19.219 --> 11:20.654
NOT AN <i>ARCHIE.</i>

11:20.721 --> 11:23.590
WELL, IF THERE'S
A SECTION ON THIS TEST

11:23.657 --> 11:26.026
CALLED "WHO GIVES
A RAT'S BUTT?"

11:26.092 --> 11:29.062
I'M SURE WE'LL PASS
WITH FLYING COLORS.

11:29.129 --> 11:31.031
YOU WANT TO
GO THERE, HUH?

11:31.097 --> 11:34.334
OH... I'M ALREADY THERE,
JUST HOPING YOU WON'T SHOW UP.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.969
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

11:36.036 --> 11:36.970
LET ME TELL YOU...

11:37.037 --> 11:39.272
WELL, WELL, WELL.

11:39.339 --> 11:41.274
HOW'S THE HAPPY COUPLE?

11:41.341 --> 11:42.643
READY TO TAKE THE TEST?

11:42.709 --> 11:44.811
YES. VERY READY.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.980
YEP, I'M TWICE
AS READY AS SHE IS.

11:47.047 --> 11:49.583
COME ON. LET'S GO.

11:54.313 --> 11:58.424
"THE COUPLE'S CUMULATIVE TOTAL
OF .008

11:58.491 --> 12:00.393
"WAS THE LOWEST
RECORDED SCORE

12:00.460 --> 12:02.569
SINCE THE INCEPTION
OF THE EXAM."

12:02.636 --> 12:04.605
I‐I‐I CAN'T EVEN
FATHOM THIS.

12:04.671 --> 12:07.974
I MEAN, YOU TWO PRACTICALLY
HAVE THE SAME MIND.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.810
SYNCLAIRE, JUST YESTERDAY

12:09.876 --> 12:13.947
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE
HUNGRY FOR CHINESE OR ITALIAN

12:14.014 --> 12:15.415
AND OVERTON WALKS IN

12:15.481 --> 12:19.419
TALKING ABOUT RESERVATIONS
AT KUNG PAO CORLEONE'S.

12:22.055 --> 12:24.958
WAIT, WAIT, LET'S JUST
SURVEY THE DATA, SHALL WE?

12:25.025 --> 12:26.627
NOW, THE FIRST QUESTION WAS

12:26.693 --> 12:28.595
"IF YOU FOUND OUT

12:28.662 --> 12:30.163
"YOUR SPOUSE WAS
HAVING AN AFFAIR

12:30.230 --> 12:31.532
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?"

12:31.598 --> 12:32.833
SYNCLAIRE ANSWERED

12:32.899 --> 12:34.701
"HOPE HE WOULDN'T
RUSH HOME

12:34.768 --> 12:37.971
AS TO NOT INTERRUPT MY
TIME WITH THE GARDENER."

12:38.038 --> 12:39.105
DOH...

12:40.240 --> 12:41.975
OVERTON'S ANSWER WAS

12:42.042 --> 12:46.079
"VIDEOTAPE IT AND SUE
HER CHEATING BUTT."

12:46.146 --> 12:48.281
OBIE, THE ONLY WAY

12:48.348 --> 12:49.783
I'D HAVE AN AFFAIR
WITH THE GARDENER

12:49.850 --> 12:51.785
IS IF YOU WERE
THE GARDENER

12:51.852 --> 12:55.288
AND YOU WERE MARRIED
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

12:55.355 --> 12:57.423
AND IF I WAS
THE GARDENER

12:57.490 --> 12:58.892
I'D DIVORCE MY WIFE

12:58.959 --> 13:00.967
AND MAKE AN HONEST
WOMAN OF YOU.

13:01.034 --> 13:02.669
I'M SORRY.

13:02.736 --> 13:04.705
I'M SORRY, TOO, OKAY?

13:08.141 --> 13:10.577
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
ABOUT REVEREND TAYLOR?

13:10.644 --> 13:11.812
DON'T LOSE HOPE, BABY.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.747
HE'LL LET US TAKE
THE EXAM AGAIN.

13:13.814 --> 13:16.282
ALL WE GOT TO DO IS
EXPLAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

13:16.349 --> 13:17.618
I DON'T KNOW, OVERTON.

13:17.684 --> 13:19.452
I DON'T EVEN THINK
A MAN OF GOD

13:19.520 --> 13:21.855
COULD FORGIVE YOUR
ANSWER TO NUMBER 14.

13:24.057 --> 13:25.425
OH, SNAP, WE REALLY
ARE COMPATIBLE.

13:25.491 --> 13:28.995
I SAID, "BURN DOWN YOUR HOUSE
AND BLOW UP YOUR CAR" TOO.

13:45.946 --> 13:47.948
( screams )

13:49.315 --> 13:51.885
HEY, GIRL,
LOOK WHO'S CHECKING OUT A BOOK

13:51.952 --> 13:54.054
FROM MY SELF‐HELP SECTION.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.557
"WHERE'S WALDO
AND WHY CAN'T HE COMMIT?"

13:57.924 --> 14:01.467
MAX, THOSE BOOKS ARE
FOR DYSFUNCTIONAL LOSERS.

14:01.535 --> 14:03.203
N‐NO OFFENSE, REGINE.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.271
ALL RIGHT!

14:05.338 --> 14:07.040
THIS WHOLE THING
WITH THE WAITER TIM

14:07.107 --> 14:09.576
IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!

14:09.643 --> 14:11.011
I MEAN... GOSH, I MEAN

14:11.077 --> 14:13.446
WHERE'S HE GET OFF
CALLING ME AGGRESSIVE?

14:13.514 --> 14:16.016
HE'S LUCKY I DIDN'T THROW HIM
IN A HEADLOCK.

14:16.082 --> 14:19.285
YOU KNOW, MAX, AS MUCH
AS I ENJOY SEEING YOU IN PAIN

14:19.352 --> 14:23.489
IT IS STARTING TO BORE ME,
SO I'M ABOUT TO GIVE YOU

14:23.557 --> 14:26.527
REGINE'S SUREFIRE
HOOK‐UP STRATEGY.

14:26.593 --> 14:28.294
WELL, I MUST BE DESPERATE

14:28.361 --> 14:30.764
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO LISTEN TO YOU.

14:30.831 --> 14:33.867
YOU SEE, LADIES,
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF MEN.

14:33.934 --> 14:36.703
THE FIRST TYPE WANTS YOU
TO TAKE CHARGE.

14:36.770 --> 14:38.939
THEY ARE SO AFRAID OF REJECTION

14:39.005 --> 14:41.875
THAT THEY WAIT UNTIL YOU
MAKE THE EFFORT.

14:41.942 --> 14:44.578
YEAH, YEAH, THE WIMPS
AND THE LOSERS‐‐ GO ON.

14:44.645 --> 14:47.147
THE SECOND TYPE ARE HUNTERS.

14:47.213 --> 14:50.183
THEY ARE IN IT
FOR THE CHALLENGE.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.919
JERKS AND THE MORONS ARE.

14:52.986 --> 14:55.989
IF YOU PURSUE A HUNTER

14:56.056 --> 14:58.191
THE CHASE IS OVER.

14:58.258 --> 15:00.360
YOU ASKING
FOR TIM'S PHONE NUMBER

15:00.426 --> 15:03.069
IS LIKE A DEER WALKING UP
TO A HUNTER

15:03.136 --> 15:06.139
AND NIBBLING ON THE BARREL
OF HIS RIFLE.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.542
REGINE, I DON'T THINK

15:08.609 --> 15:11.411
YOUR TIGER BEAT WISDOM
IS GOING TO HELP MAX.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.748
SHE AND THE WAITER TIM
ARE NOT MEANT FOR EACH OTHER.

15:14.815 --> 15:16.316
SHUT UP, KHADIJAH.

15:16.382 --> 15:18.218
GO AHEAD, REGINE.

15:18.284 --> 15:21.154
YOU HAVE GOT TO LET
THE WAITER TIM

15:21.221 --> 15:25.559
SEE THE RESERVED, SENSITIVE,
FEMININE SIDE OF YOU.

15:25.626 --> 15:28.662
SHE MEANS IF YOU BELCH,
DON'T IDENTIFY THE SMELL.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.232
I'M GOING TO GO DOWN
THERE RIGHT NOW

15:32.298 --> 15:35.101
AND SHOW THAT JACKASS JUST
HOW SENSITIVE I CAN BE.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.770
COME ON, REGINE,
LET'S GO.

15:36.837 --> 15:41.808
MAXINE, WHEN YOU CLIMB UP
THE MOUNTAIN TO TALK TO THE GURU

15:41.875 --> 15:45.211
SHE DOES NOT CLIMB BACK DOWN
WITH YOU.

15:49.750 --> 15:51.251
HERE HE COMES.

15:52.686 --> 15:55.589
JUST WATCH MY SENSITIVE SIDE.

15:55.656 --> 15:57.090
OKAY...

15:57.157 --> 15:59.593
OH, IT'S... <i>YOU.</i>

15:59.660 --> 16:00.967
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

16:01.034 --> 16:02.202
MANY CHOICES, WAITER.

16:02.268 --> 16:03.604
WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND?

16:04.771 --> 16:06.106
( gasps )

16:06.172 --> 16:07.407
DID YOU FEEL THAT?

16:07.473 --> 16:08.909
A WARM FEELING

16:08.975 --> 16:10.511
JUST PASSED BETWEEN US.

16:10.577 --> 16:12.979
IS IT ME? IS IT YOU?
COULD IT BE US?

16:13.046 --> 16:15.849
LADY, DON'T MAKE ME
MOVE OUT OF NEW YORK, OKAY?

16:16.917 --> 16:18.519
WELL, FOLKS

16:18.585 --> 16:21.154
THOSE HOT WINGS ARE
REALLY STARTING TO KICK IN.

16:21.221 --> 16:23.423
I'LL BE BACK IN ABOUT FIVE.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.960
MAX, NOW LISTEN...

16:27.027 --> 16:28.895
I CONSIDER US TO BE FAM.

16:28.962 --> 16:31.364
SO I FEEL AS THOUGH
I CAN TELL YOU THAT

16:31.431 --> 16:34.300
YOU'RE MAKING A COMPLETE ASS
OUT OF YOURSELF.

16:34.367 --> 16:37.370
NOW, COME ON, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE, PLEASE?

16:37.437 --> 16:38.572
YEAH, YEAH

16:38.639 --> 16:41.207
KHADIJAH, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD LEAVE.

16:41.274 --> 16:43.476
THIS AIN'T GOING
TO BE PRETTY.

16:43.544 --> 16:44.410

17:57.323 --> 17:59.459
OKAY.

17:59.526 --> 18:00.934
I'LL CALL YOU.

18:01.001 --> 18:02.268
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

18:02.335 --> 18:03.970
NOW, BLOW IT OUT
YOUR BUS BOX.

18:04.037 --> 18:05.639
I DON'T GO FOR
DESPERATE MEN.

18:07.841 --> 18:09.275
COME ON, KHADIJAH.

18:09.342 --> 18:11.411
LET'S GET UP
ON OUT OF HERE.

18:18.418 --> 18:20.186
HELLO, REVEREND.

18:20.253 --> 18:21.555
I‐I'M SORRY WE'RE EARLY.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.757
WE WERE REALLY ANXIOUS
TO TALK TO YOU.

18:23.824 --> 18:25.491
OH, DON'T YOU FRET, SYNCLAIRE.

18:25.559 --> 18:26.760
I DON'T THINK SATAN

18:26.827 --> 18:28.862
COULD HAVE TAKEN
TOO MUCH MORE.

18:28.929 --> 18:31.798
WHOA‐HO‐HO‐HO‐HO!

18:31.865 --> 18:33.734
UH, UH, REVEREND

18:33.800 --> 18:35.001
ABOUT THE EXAM.

18:35.068 --> 18:37.337
I KNOW WE DIDN'T EXACTLY
IMPRESS THE CHURCH

18:37.403 --> 18:38.539
WITH OUR STORY.

18:38.605 --> 18:40.240
"IMPRESS THE CHURCH"?

18:40.306 --> 18:42.275
SON, YOU SIGNED YOUR NAME

18:42.342 --> 18:45.211
OVERTON
"BETTER DEAD THAN WED" JONES.

18:45.278 --> 18:47.581
WELL, SIR, THERE'S
A PERFECTLY GOOD REASON

18:47.648 --> 18:49.850
FOR OVERTON'S
NOT‐SO‐FUNNY NOM DE PLUME.

18:49.916 --> 18:51.718
LET ME HAZARD A GUESS.

18:51.785 --> 18:54.621
YOU TWO HAD A SPAT
BEFORE THE EXAM

18:54.688 --> 18:58.892
AND THEN TURNED ON EACH OTHER
LIKE CAIN TURNED ON ABEL.

18:58.959 --> 19:00.226
I KNEW YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

19:00.293 --> 19:02.536
SO, IF YOU JUST LET US
TAKE THE EXAM AGAIN

19:02.603 --> 19:05.071
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
WE'LL ALL BE DODGING RICE.

19:05.138 --> 19:07.908
OVERTON, SYNCLAIRE, I'D
LOVE TO MARRY YOU TWO

19:07.974 --> 19:09.510
BUT THE FACT
IS I CAN'T.

19:09.576 --> 19:11.745
YOU SEE, THE BISHOP,
WELL, HE'S, UH...

19:11.812 --> 19:15.115
A REAL STICKLER
ON CHURCH POLICY, YOU SEE

19:15.181 --> 19:19.019
AND BESIDES, HE HOLDS
THE MORTGAGE ON OUR HOME.

19:19.085 --> 19:21.655
SYNCLAIRE'S COUNTING
ON YOU MARRYING US

19:21.722 --> 19:25.526
AND IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO HER,
THEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

19:25.592 --> 19:30.063
I‐I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU, SON,
BUT MY HANDS ARE TIED. I...

19:30.130 --> 19:32.398
OH! THERE
ARE OUR TWO LOVEBIRDS.

19:32.465 --> 19:36.302
NOW, YOU BE SURE AND GET ME
THAT ORGAN MUSIC EARLY.

19:36.369 --> 19:39.640
I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG,
BUT I CAN POUND OUT

19:39.706 --> 19:43.677
A PRETTY ROUSING VERSION
OF "BOOGIE OOGIE OOGIE."

19:43.744 --> 19:46.580
UH, HOW'S YOUR
VERSION OF "TAPS"?

19:46.647 --> 19:47.681
WHAT?

19:47.748 --> 19:49.249
THE REVEREND CAN'T MARRY US

19:49.315 --> 19:51.552
BECAUSE WE FAILED
THE COMPATIBILITY TEST.

19:51.618 --> 19:52.653
YOU TWO FAILED?

19:52.719 --> 19:53.920
NOW, THIS JUST PROVES

19:53.987 --> 19:56.356
WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING
ALL ALONG, LESLIE.

19:56.422 --> 19:58.158
THAT TEST IS A CROCK.

19:58.224 --> 19:59.492
YOU KNOW THE BISHOP

19:59.560 --> 20:02.168
IS A FERVENT BELIEVER
IN THAT THERE TEST.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.204
WELL, I'M NOT LISTENING
TO THE BISHOP

20:04.270 --> 20:05.772
TILL HE FIXES OUR TOILET.

20:05.839 --> 20:07.307
CAN'T THEY TAKE IT AGAIN?

20:07.373 --> 20:08.441
NOBODY WILL KNOW.

20:08.509 --> 20:11.077
I WON'T SAY BOO.

20:11.144 --> 20:13.446
LOOK, DON'T YOU TELL ME
HOW TO DO MY JOB.

20:13.514 --> 20:15.516
I DON'T TELL YOU
HOW TO PLAY

20:15.582 --> 20:17.050
THAT RAGGEDY ORGAN
OF YOURS.

20:17.117 --> 20:18.318
IT'S NOT HALF AS RAGGEDY

20:18.384 --> 20:20.654
AS THAT COUCH YOU'LL
BE SLEEPING ON TONIGHT.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.122
EXCUSE ME.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.224
I DON'T WANT TO
SPEAK OUT OF TURN

20:24.290 --> 20:27.561
BUT SEEMS TO ME IF
YOU ALL TOOK THAT
TEST RIGHT NOW

20:27.628 --> 20:29.896
I DON'T THINK YOU'D
MAKE THE HONOR ROLL.

20:29.963 --> 20:32.098
POINT TAKEN.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.535
HOWEVER, THE ARGUMENT
BETWEEN YOU TWO

20:34.601 --> 20:35.869
DOES CONCERN ME.

20:35.936 --> 20:38.772
THEN AGAIN, THE ARGUMENT
BETWEEN MY WIFE AND ME

20:38.839 --> 20:40.373
CONCERNS ME A LITTLE MORE.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.475
ANYONE WHO DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN HELL

20:42.543 --> 20:44.077
HASN'T SLEPT ON THAT COUCH.

20:44.144 --> 20:45.178
YOU AND THE MISSUS

20:45.245 --> 20:47.180
STILL LOVE EACH OTHER,
DON'T YOU?

20:47.247 --> 20:50.584
OH, I WAS JUST KIDDING
ABOUT THE COUCH.

20:50.651 --> 20:52.853
YOU CAN SLEEP IN THE TUB.

20:54.555 --> 20:55.756
ALL RIGHT.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.123
IF YOU TWO
WILL ENROLL

20:57.190 --> 20:59.192
IN A LITTLE PREMARITAL
COUNSELING

20:59.259 --> 21:02.468
WELL, UH, I'LL FIND A WAY
TO LET YOU RETAKE THE TEST.

21:02.536 --> 21:03.804
Synclaire:
OH, REALLY?

21:03.870 --> 21:05.405
IT IS FREE, RIGHT?

21:05.471 --> 21:06.640
OH, ABSOLUTELY FREE.

21:06.707 --> 21:09.009
YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT
WITH A HOLY STICK.

21:09.075 --> 21:10.210
Synclaire:
AMEN.

21:10.276 --> 21:12.178
OH, OBIE, I'M SO HAPPY.

21:12.245 --> 21:15.048
THEY REMIND YOU
OF US WHEN WE
WERE STARTING OUT.

21:15.115 --> 21:16.249
FULL OF LIFE.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.718
YOU'D BETTER BELIEVE IT.

21:17.784 --> 21:20.587
READY TO GRAB THE
WORLD BY THE TAIL.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.323
AND NOT GIVE IN TO
THE PLEASURES OF THE FLESH

21:23.389 --> 21:25.191
UNTIL THAT MAGICAL
WEDDING NIGHT.

21:25.258 --> 21:27.160
OH, WILL YOU LOOK
AT THE TIME?

21:27.227 --> 21:28.695
WE'VE REALLY
GOT TO GO.

21:28.762 --> 21:30.163
WE'LL SEE YOU.

21:40.741 --> 21:44.745
