CRYSTAD
Jason.

33:14.284 --> 33:18.778
Jason. You changed my life.
You know that?

33:21.958 --> 33:24.449
You woke me up to a whole other world.

33:25.795 --> 33:28.958
A world I never would have seen
if it weren't for you.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.548
Crystal?

33:32.969 --> 33:34.880
If you ever loved me--

33:50.195 --> 33:52.231
Dog damn, Jason. You're burning up.

33:52.405 --> 33:56.694
That means it's working.
Panther magic's taking hold of you.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.488
Ain't that great?

33:59.663 --> 34:01.028
I'm dying.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.664
I'm fucking dying.

34:09.339 --> 34:12.502
You was always wondering
what your purpose was in life.

34:12.676 --> 34:15.042
Well, this is it right here.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.547
To save our people from going extinct.

34:20.517 --> 34:23.850
Oh, Jesus. Help me.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.602
Our girls ain't getting
pregnant much anymore.

34:28.191 --> 34:32.355
Some do, but cubs either come out dead
or they die soon thereafter.

34:33.363 --> 34:35.604
The ones that live
ain't much to brag about.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.531
Hey, Crystal. Look at me.

34:39.703 --> 34:41.034
I'm sick, baby.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.705
You ain't sick.

34:42.872 --> 34:44.703
I need a doctor.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.250
You're being reborn.

34:48.128 --> 34:49.709
As one of us.

34:51.381 --> 34:53.292
As our new Ghost Daddy.

35:02.392 --> 35:04.474
I need you to take this, okay?

35:04.644 --> 35:08.262
-What is it? Medicine?
-Uh-huh.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.277
Thank you.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.565
-|t's Mexican Viagra.
-What the fuck?

35:19.743 --> 35:23.577
Not that you need it, butjust in case.

35:23.747 --> 35:26.910
Well, it never worked on Felton, anyway.
Heh,heh.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.931
SOOKIE:
Hey, Tara.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.266
TARA: I need a favor, Sook.
-Okay.

35:52.067 --> 35:56.310
I need you to talk to Eric Northman
and beg him to forgive Lafayette.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.149
-Forgive him for what?
-He'l| know.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.655
Well, what if he doesn't?

36:01.576 --> 36:04.238
I went with Lafayette and Jesus
to this Wicca circle...

36:04.412 --> 36:06.824
...that Holly and them are in,
and Eric attacked us...

36:07.040 --> 36:09.747
...and one of the witches
cast a spell to make him leave.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.624
Do you know what kind of spell?

36:11.795 --> 36:14.787
No. And why do | get the feeling
you're more upset about Eric...

36:14.964 --> 36:18.297
...than to the leader, who he bit?
Or me, who he tried to?

36:18.468 --> 36:20.959
-Oh, my God.
-So can you just try to square things...

36:21.137 --> 36:24.129
...between Lafayette and Eric
so Lafayette doesn't end up dead...

36:24.307 --> 36:27.674
...in that dungeon in the basement
of Fangtasia? Again.

36:27.852 --> 36:33.017
Tara, I'm pretty sure Lafayette doesn't
have anything to fear from Eric right now.

36:35.485 --> 36:39.444
But I'll be happy to talk to him
it! run into him.

36:39.614 --> 36:43.027
If? He bought your house.
He has a cubby in it.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.785
Yeah, but I haven't seen him.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.571
I mean, since Pam told me
he's gone missing.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.740
Missing? Fuck.

36:51.918 --> 36:57.288
Well, hello, stranger.
When did you get back into town?

36:57.507 --> 36:59.543
Yesterday.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.254
Where have you been for the last year?

37:02.429 --> 37:05.637
Well, my tables ain't gonna wait
themselves, so....

37:07.100 --> 37:09.056
Join me in a shot of tequila?

37:09.227 --> 37:10.728
-Hell, yeah.
-Yeah?

37:10.895 --> 37:12.396
Yeah.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.062
Here's to old friends.

37:24.743 --> 37:28.406
-To old friends.
-Which I'm assuming we still are.

37:28.830 --> 37:32.118
Othen/vise, I wouldn't even bother
asking you, what the fuck?

37:32.375 --> 37:36.209
I need a little more information
to know what you're talking about.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.244
| tell you I'm a shifter,
you leave town.

37:39.007 --> 37:41.419
I don't mind sharing with you,
but that fucking hurt.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.504
That's not why I left.

37:43.678 --> 37:47.591
l was just following your advice.
You said I could start a brand new life.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.722
I never said any such thing.

37:50.727 --> 37:52.467
Because that ain't true.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.931
The life we got is the life we got.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.267
The jury's still out on that for me.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.694
-You still hate me for being a shifter?
-Mm.

38:05.742 --> 38:08.233
-I never hated you for anything.
-Yeah.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.026
l was just traumatized.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.786
You okay now?

38:14.125 --> 38:15.581
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

38:15.752 --> 38:17.492
Yeah. I'm good.

38:17.670 --> 38:20.332
You got a place to stay?
I got a unit open.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.755
I'm just here for a few days.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.919
-Can stay at my place.
-Wow. Um....

38:28.765 --> 38:30.926
-That's really nice.
-Well?

38:31.434 --> 38:35.427
But I'm seeing somebody, Sam.

38:35.605 --> 38:37.812
Back in New Orleans.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.268
Okay. Okay.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.526
-Wasn't insinuating.
-Mm-hm.

38:43.696 --> 38:46.733
I'm seeing somebody too.
It's very early stages.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.611
Yeah, well....

38:49.452 --> 38:51.784
Do her a favor
and stop flirting with me.

38:51.955 --> 38:53.946
Because you hate it so much.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.788
-You're bad, Sam Merlotte.
-Yes, I am bad.

38:59.629 --> 39:02.371
Hey, Tara, Sam.
You guys seen Lafayette?

39:02.590 --> 39:04.330
He's in the kitchen.

39:04.509 --> 39:08.969
-No, he's not.
-Fuck. Bye, Sam.

39:10.473 --> 39:13.215
JESUS: I checked here to make sure
he didn't do anything stupid.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.680
-Shit! His car is gone!
-Motherfucker.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.847
Terry told me he paid him $100,
$100 to cover his shift tonight.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.640
-Thought you would talk him out of it!
-I thought I did!

39:22.819 --> 39:25.526
Take my car. I got something
in the trunk we're gonna need.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.813
He's only got 15 minutes on us, tops.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.606
[CAR ENGINE STARTS]

39:30.243 --> 39:31.483
Motherfucker.

39:48.177 --> 39:51.340
ANSWERING MACHINE: At the tone,
please record your voice message.

39:52.265 --> 39:55.007
Eric, this is the second message
I've left you.

39:59.272 --> 40:01.433
I want you to call me back now.

40:02.859 --> 40:06.772
And to avoid any confusion,
that is a command from your king.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.532
l have a proposal for you.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.041
Okay.

40:22.962 --> 40:26.796
I believe you and l have a very functional
and successful business relationship.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.547
So do |.

40:28.718 --> 40:33.052
And unless I'm mistaken,
that relationship is also friendly.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.804
-Genuinely friendly.
-I agree.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.761
Okay. Thank you.

40:37.936 --> 40:41.724
Now, I completely understand
the concept of not rocking the boat.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.729
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

40:43.900 --> 40:47.734
But, on the other hand,
I think it doesn't make much sense...

40:47.904 --> 40:50.395
...to not go after something one wants...

40:50.573 --> 40:54.737
...when that something
happens to be seemingly unattached.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.445
I do believe you are blushing.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.954
Well, here's the thing, Bill.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.912
There are about three guys in this whole
town that I ever considered dating.

41:04.087 --> 41:05.918
And I did. I dated all three of them.

41:06.089 --> 41:09.752
One turned out to be gay,
one is a secret racist...

41:09.926 --> 41:12.963
...and the other one is seriously
undenNhelming in the sack.

41:13.137 --> 41:17.346
Now, you are the smartest,
most powerful man I know...

41:17.517 --> 41:20.429
...and I am the smartest,
most powerful woman I know.

41:20.603 --> 41:24.437
So I propose we try--
The operative word being "try"--

41:24.607 --> 41:30.102
To add sex to that equation,
knowing that we are both adults...

41:30.279 --> 41:31.860
...and if it doesn't work out...

41:32.031 --> 41:35.444
...it doesn't have to impact
our professional friendship.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.034
Well, you really have
thought all this out.

41:45.795 --> 41:47.535
What do you say?

41:51.134 --> 41:52.874
I can never love you.

41:59.475 --> 42:03.309
One needs a young heart to take the leap
that love requires of us...

42:05.148 --> 42:08.686
...and my heart, like every other
part of me, is no longer young.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.351
I can accept that.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.318
Check, please.

42:16.659 --> 42:18.650
JESSICA:
I think he really likes it.

42:18.828 --> 42:21.160
It's kind of dirty, isn't it?

42:21.330 --> 42:23.321
No, no. That's just age.

42:23.499 --> 42:26.081
You know, that doll's been
in my family for a long time.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.205
-|t's kind of like an heirloom.
-Ohh.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.040
Well, you should keep it then.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.500
No, I owe your baby a gift.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.382
Please, I want you to have it,
and look, he loves it.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.420
Thank you, Jessica. We appreciate it.

42:42.810 --> 42:46.553
Nice, sturdy doll like that.
He can't do too much damage to it.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.782
How long you gonna keep
wearing that thing?

43:03.956 --> 43:05.696
Hey, can we talk? In private?

43:06.876 --> 43:08.537
Talk.

43:10.546 --> 43:14.130
-Got some pretty interesting news, Sam.
-Okay.

43:14.717 --> 43:20.713
Well, Maxine's house might be sitting
on a fuckload of natural gas.

43:20.890 --> 43:23.973
Ohh. Good for Maxine.

43:24.143 --> 43:27.226
Yeah, but the good part is
she don't even know about it.

43:29.899 --> 43:31.059
How do you know?

43:31.234 --> 43:33.816
Prospector come to the house,
talked to me.

43:33.986 --> 43:37.570
-And I didn't even tell her.
-Why not? She's got a right to know.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.277
Not if we're gonna buy
the house out from underneath her.

43:40.576 --> 43:43.113
I bet you we can get it cheap.
She got money problems.

43:43.287 --> 43:45.323
Spends it all on mail-order dolls.

43:45.998 --> 43:48.159
You want to buy Maxine's house?

43:48.376 --> 43:52.585
Yeah. Yeah, you and me, and then we
could split all the natural gas money.

43:52.755 --> 43:54.916
I'm not gonna let you
do that to Maxine.

43:55.591 --> 43:57.968
What? What? Hey.

43:58.928 --> 44:01.920
Hey. You're choosing Maxine
over your own flesh and blood?

44:02.098 --> 44:05.465
No, I'm choosing right over wrong.
Speaking of wrong, Tommy...

44:05.643 --> 44:08.430
...there's something wrong
with you if you would consider...

44:08.604 --> 44:11.596
...doing this to someone
who's been nothing but generous to you.

44:11.774 --> 44:14.607
She don't care about me.
Maxine just wants another Hoyt.

44:14.777 --> 44:17.189
Hoyt is a good man
who would never steal...

44:17.405 --> 44:19.817
...no matter what.
You're not even in Hoyt's league.

44:19.991 --> 44:23.108
