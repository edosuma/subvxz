33:20.540 --> 33:21.791
I MEAN,
THIS GUY DOESN'T SHOW UP.

33:21.875 --> 33:22.959
SO NOW YOU CAN'T PAY THAT GUY.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.294

WITH THE JEANS?

39:17.146 --> 39:18.982
‐ IT'S JUST
A SIDE BUSINESS, MAN.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.067
‐ WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOU?

39:21.150 --> 39:27.073
WHO IS THIS GUY
THEY ARRESTED YOU WITH?

39:27.156 --> 39:30.577

39:55.685 --> 39:57.061
‐ YEAH.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.313

39:58.396 --> 39:59.731
‐ WELL, LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.441
YOU JUST GOT YOURSELF
A SHINY NEW NICKNAME.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.787

IT IS A GOOD STORY.

40:14.871 --> 40:15.997
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

40:16.080 --> 40:17.540

40:36.976 --> 40:41.105
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN RAT OUT HIS

40:41.189 --> 40:44.275
RESPECT, MAN.

40:45.693 --> 40:46.945
[music stops]

WAS LIFTED OFF THE PORT.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.994
WHICH MAKES IT
CUSTOMS' PROBLEM, NOT MINE.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.746
CONGRATULATIONS, JAKES.

40:56.829 --> 41:00.333
YOU ARE NOW THE PROUD OWNER
OF 12,000 KNOCKOFF LEVI'S...

41:00.416 --> 41:01.542
[laughter]

41:01.626 --> 41:04.170
COURTESY OF YOUR
NEW BESTEST BUDDY MIKE.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.798

41:13.721 --> 41:15.473
‐ SO WE'RE SURE
THAT THEY HAVE FELIX'S FAMILY.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.016
‐ YEAH.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.394
FELIX PANICKED WHEN THE LAWYER
ASKED HIM ABOUT MIKE.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.770
SAID HE WAS
HIS BROTHER‐IN‐LAW.

41:20.853 --> 41:23.439
‐ HE SAID WHAT?
‐ YEAH. BUT WE GOT LUCKY.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.191
FELIX DOES HAVE
A BROTHER‐IN‐LAW

41:25.274 --> 41:27.193
WITH A PASSING RESEMBLANCE
TO MIKE.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.696
BY WHICH I MEAN HE'S WHITE.
‐ FRANKIE BOUT.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.197
‐ WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR HEIGHT.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.032
HE'S GOT A SCAR
ABOVE HIS LEFT EYE,

41:33.116 --> 41:35.159
AND IF IT COMES UP, YOU'VE LOST
A HELL OF A LOT OF WEIGHT.

41:35.243 --> 41:39.080
‐ OTHER THAN THAT,
HE'S A PERFECT MATCH.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.081
[whispering]
ONE MINUTE.

41:40.164 --> 41:43.001
MIKE, COME ON.

41:45.420 --> 41:48.381
SO HOW'S YOUR NEW JOB
SO FAR, HUH?

41:48.464 --> 41:50.008
‐ OH, WELL, IT'S GREAT.

41:50.008 --> 41:53.052
CLEANED SOME DISHES,
LEARNED HOW TO SURF.

41:53.136 --> 41:56.264
SO WHAT EXACTLY
IS GONNA HAPPEN HERE?

41:56.347 --> 41:58.725
‐ KIDNAPPING A FAMILY
IS MESSY, MIKE.

41:58.808 --> 42:00.184
ALL RIGHT,
THEY'RE BAILING YOU OUT

42:00.268 --> 42:01.978
BECAUSE THEY WANT ASSURANCE
THAT FELIX WON'T TALK.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.229
THEY THINK YOU'RE FAMILY.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.731
THEY GET YOU TO DO
SOMETHING ILLEGAL.

42:04.814 --> 42:06.190
THEN IF FELIX TALKS TO US,
THEY TURN YOU IN.

42:06.274 --> 42:07.275
‐ ILLEGAL.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.402
‐ YEAH.

42:09.485 --> 42:12.321
UH, WE'VE SEEN THEM
DO THIS BEFORE.

42:12.405 --> 42:15.033
THEY'RE GONNA ASK YOU
TO KILL SOMEONE...

42:15.116 --> 42:16.367
MIKE.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.703
NOW ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS GET A NAME, OKAY?

42:18.786 --> 42:19.996
YOU COME BACK TO US,
THAT'S IT.

42:20.079 --> 42:21.372
WE GOT A GUY
OVER AT THE PAPER,

42:21.456 --> 42:24.917
HE'LL PLAY BALL
WITH A HOMICIDE STORY, AN OBIT.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.544
THEY THINK THE GUY'S DEAD,
THEY LET THE FAMILY GO.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.135
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

42:34.218 --> 42:38.181
‐ YEAH, BUT IF I DON'T,
WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT FAMILY?

42:40.600 --> 42:42.935
[sighs]

42:43.019 --> 42:45.521
‐ ALL RIGHT.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.356
ALL RIGHT, WE GOTTA ASSUME
THESE RUSSIAN PRICKS

42:47.440 --> 42:49.067
HAVE THE SAME INTEL WE DO.

42:49.150 --> 42:50.485
YOU GOT EXACTLY ONE HOUR
TO BECOME THIS GUY.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.028
YOUR NAME'S FRANKIE BOUT.
YOU GOT IT, MIKE?

42:52.111 --> 42:53.780
‐ FRANKIE BOUT.
‐ YEAH.

42:53.863 --> 42:55.990
YOUR WIFE'S NAME IS KATERINA.
SHE'S FELIX'S WIFE'S SISTER.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.325
HER NAME IS IRINA.
‐ WAIT, WAIT.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.452
WAIT, MY WIFE IS KATERINA
OR FELIX'S?

42:59.535 --> 43:01.079
‐ YOURS.

43:01.162 --> 43:02.455
WRITE IT DOWN.
‐ SURE.

43:02.538 --> 43:03.664
‐ YOU EVER BEEN TO CHI TOWN?

43:03.748 --> 43:04.916
‐ I DROVE THERE ONCE
IN COLLEGE.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.167
‐ ALL RIGHT, WELL,
NOW YOU'RE FROM THERE.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.544
SO JUST REMEMBER WRIGLEYVILLE,
SEARS TOWER, MAGIC MILE.

43:08.628 --> 43:11.089

43:12.590 --> 43:14.342

SHE'S A YEAR YOUNGER THAN ME.

43:14.425 --> 43:15.968
‐ GOOD MAN.

DAMN IT! I KNOW THAT.

43:22.809 --> 43:24.060
I KNOW THAT.

43:24.143 --> 43:25.728

43:25.812 --> 43:28.606

SUSPICION NARCO POSSESSION.

43:28.689 --> 43:30.024
ARRESTING OFFICER
NOTED TRACK MARKS.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.275
THIS GUY'S A JUNKIE?

43:31.359 --> 43:32.735
CHARLIE,
WE NEED A MAKEUP JOB.

43:32.819 --> 43:34.112
‐ WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
HE COULD'VE GOTTEN HIGH?

43:34.195 --> 43:36.280
‐ UH, 11:30.

43:36.364 --> 43:40.034
‐ YOU SHOOT UP HERE, 'CAUSE
YOUR WATCH'LL COVER THESE UP.

43:40.034 --> 43:41.869
YOU HAVEN'T HAD A HIT
IN 14 HOURS.

43:41.953 --> 43:43.955
YOU'RE IN WITHDRAWAL,
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE SHAKY.

43:44.038 --> 43:45.998
SEE? YOU'RE A NATURAL.
‐ [laughs]

43:47.458 --> 43:50.002
‐ ALL RIGHT, SO I GOT A PAIR

43:50.002 --> 43:51.796

43:51.879 --> 43:53.506
AND A WALLET FOR ONE
FRANKIE BOUT.

43:53.589 --> 43:55.424
IT'S GOT THE PLASTIC,
MONEY, I. D., WHATEVER.

43:55.508 --> 43:56.676
‐ NO, NO, NO.

43:56.759 --> 43:57.969
THIS GUY DOESN'T HAVE
A GOLD CARD.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.095
AND THE ONLY THING HE'S DOING
WITH A LIBRARY CARD

43:59.178 --> 44:00.930
IS CHOPPING HIS H.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.390
THIS THING IS BRAND‐NEW.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.684
JOHNNY, GO...TOSS IT AROUND
IN THE SAND OR SOMETHING.

44:04.767 --> 44:06.018
‐ YOU SE‐‐
‐ KICK IT.

44:06.102 --> 44:09.063
ALL RIGHT, FRANKIE BOUT,
THIS IS YOUR TRANSMITTER, OKAY?

44:09.147 --> 44:10.314
NOW WE CAN HEAR YOU,
BUT YOU CAN'T HEAR US.

44:10.398 --> 44:11.732
VERY IMPORTANT.

44:11.816 --> 44:12.984
IF THEY SWEEP YOU,
PRESS THIS BUTTON.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.735
CUTS THE TRANSMISSION.
PUSH IT AGAIN TO RESTART.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.529
YOU GOT IT?
‐ YEAH.

44:19.699 --> 44:20.950
YOU'RE TRACKING ME, RIGHT?

44:21.033 --> 44:22.827

TOO HARD TO CLOAK.

44:22.910 --> 44:25.121
BUT WE'VE GOT YOUR AUDIO.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.956
‐ JUST GIVE US AS MUCH INFO
ABOUT YOUR 20 AS YOU CAN

44:27.039 --> 44:28.291
WITHOUT TIPPING HIM OFF.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

44:28.374 --> 44:29.458
‐ YES, SIR.
‐ MIKE, LOOK AT ME.

44:29.542 --> 44:31.460
COME HERE.

44:31.544 --> 44:33.796
OUR GUY HAD A Y‐SHAPED SCAR
ABOVE HIS LEFT EYE.

44:35.131 --> 44:38.009
JUST PRETEND THAT FELIX
CAME TO YOU TONIGHT

44:38.092 --> 44:42.889
AND SAID, "THEY TOOK MY KIDS.
THEY TOOK MY WIFE.

44:42.972 --> 44:45.349
YOU GOTTA HELP ME."

44:45.433 --> 44:47.143
YOU CAN DO THIS.

44:47.226 --> 44:50.062
I LIKE THE SCAR.

44:50.146 --> 44:51.230
YOU LOOK TOUGH.

44:53.316 --> 44:54.233
‐ WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
JOHNNY, LET ME SEE THAT.

44:54.317 --> 44:55.443
COME ON, MAN.

44:55.526 --> 44:56.694
GUY CARRIES THIS
IN HIS POCKET.

44:56.777 --> 44:57.987
HE DOESN'T DRAG IT
BEHIND HIS CAR.

44:58.070 --> 44:59.322
‐ IT'S DARK OUT THERE, BRO.

44:59.405 --> 45:01.824
WHAT YOU WANT?

45:03.242 --> 45:05.620

45:23.012 --> 45:26.432
‐ BOUT, FRANKIE.

45:30.019 --> 45:32.021
SIGN.

45:32.021 --> 45:33.814
‐ [sniffles, clears throat]

45:53.584 --> 45:56.128
YOU SURF?

45:56.212 --> 45:57.630
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.840
IT KICKS ASS.

46:03.135 --> 46:04.262
‐ MR. BOUT,
RAISE YOUR ARMS, PLEASE.

46:07.431 --> 46:10.017
‐ HE JUST STOPPED TRANSMITTING.
‐ THEY'RE SWEEPING HIM.

46:10.017 --> 46:12.019
[wand warbles]

46:12.103 --> 46:13.729
‐ THANK YOU.

46:13.813 --> 46:15.606
‐ OKAY, WE GOT HIM BACK.

46:15.690 --> 46:16.607
Nayfeld [on radio]:
YOU SPEAK RUSSIAN?

46:16.691 --> 46:17.984
‐ NO, THAT'S MY WIFE.

46:17.984 --> 46:20.069
THE ONLY I UNDERSTAND IN RUSSIAN
IS "NOT TONIGHT."

46:20.152 --> 46:21.487
‐ [laughing]
MY MAN.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.909
‐ THEY'RE MOVING.

46:31.122 --> 46:32.248
‐ I'M GOING IN ON THIS.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.000
‐ NO, YOU'RE NOT.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.668

IN MOTION.

46:35.751 --> 46:36.961
GET OUTTA HERE.

46:37.044 --> 46:38.421

46:38.504 --> 46:40.631
‐ YEAH, YOU COULD.

46:40.715 --> 46:41.966
BUT I DON'T WANT
AN AGENT OUT THERE

46:41.966 --> 46:44.635
LOOKING FOR REVENGE
AND NEITHER DOES YOUR BOSS.

46:44.719 --> 46:47.263

48:00.127 --> 48:02.004
‐ YEAH. HMM.

48:02.088 --> 48:03.589

48:03.672 --> 48:04.965
COFFEE, WATER?

48:05.049 --> 48:06.967
‐ NO, THANKS.
I'M FINE.

48:07.051 --> 48:09.762
‐ BENJI,

48:15.351 --> 48:16.894
YOU DROP A FEW POUNDS
RECENTLY?

48:16.977 --> 48:20.022
‐ IT'S A JUICE CLEANSE.
‐ [laughing]

48:20.106 --> 48:21.399
IS THAT THE ONE
WHERE YOU SKIP THE CARBS

48:21.482 --> 48:23.901
AND SHOOT UP ON SMACK?

48:23.984 --> 48:26.404
[laughter]

48:26.487 --> 48:29.073

48:31.033 --> 48:33.411
‐ YOU'RE RIGHT.

48:33.494 --> 48:36.330
FELIX'S WIFE AND KIDS
SHOULD GO HOME.

48:36.414 --> 48:38.082
‐ ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

48:38.165 --> 48:40.084

48:40.167 --> 48:42.002
FORGET IT.
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

48:42.086 --> 48:43.629
‐ WE'RE LOSING HIM.
‐ PULL HIM BACK, MIKEY.

48:43.712 --> 48:44.964
PULL HIM BACK.

48:44.964 --> 48:46.799
‐ WHATEVER YOU NEED ME TO DO,
I CAN DO‐‐I CAN!

48:46.882 --> 48:48.968
‐ NO, YOU CAN'T!
'CAUSE YOU'RE GODDAMN JUNKIE.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.010

48:51.679 --> 48:53.013
AND BLOWING THIS BACK
IN MY FACE.

48:53.097 --> 48:54.098
‐ COME ON, WHAT,
DO YOU WANT ME TO KILL SOMEBODY?

48:54.181 --> 48:55.850
I CAN KILL SOMEBODY.
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.726

48:57.810 --> 48:59.228
YOU KILLED SOMEONE?

48:59.311 --> 49:00.771
‐ YEAH.

49:00.855 --> 49:02.064
‐ WHERE'S HE GOING WITH THIS?

49:02.148 --> 49:03.149
‐ I WISH I KNEW, BOSS.

49:03.232 --> 49:04.859
‐ WELL, IF YOU LET IRINA
AND THE KIDS GO,

49:04.942 --> 49:06.068
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

49:06.152 --> 49:07.987
‐ I WANT YOU TO THINK
VERY CAREFULLY

49:07.987 --> 49:10.197
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
TO ME NEXT, FRANKIE.

49:10.281 --> 49:12.032
I'VE GOT FRIENDS
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.659
I CAN CHECK DETAILS.

49:13.742 --> 49:16.203
IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME,
I'M GOING TO KNOW.

49:16.287 --> 49:18.497
YOU SIT.

49:24.420 --> 49:28.841
WHO'D YOU KILL?

49:28.924 --> 49:31.385

HE WAS SITTING ON THE TOILET.

49:31.469 --> 49:34.680
[laughter]

49:34.763 --> 49:36.307

MIKEY, NICE!

49:36.390 --> 49:37.683

49:37.766 --> 49:39.101
THE KID'S GONNA
GET HIMSELF KILLED.

49:39.185 --> 49:40.144
‐ OKAY, I NEED
A COLD CASE REPORT

49:40.227 --> 49:41.604
ENTERED INTO NCIC.

49:41.687 --> 49:42.813
THIS IS GONNA BE
AN UNSOLVED HOMICIDE,

49:42.897 --> 49:43.981
LOS ANGELES, TWO YEARS AGO.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.441

49:45.524 --> 49:46.901
‐ NO, NO, NO.
JOHNNY, HE'S SURFING.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.027
‐ WHERE DID THIS GO DOWN?

49:48.027 --> 49:50.613
‐ LOS ANGELES,
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

49:50.696 --> 49:51.739
‐ WHAT ARE YOU,
A MIND READER NOW?

49:51.822 --> 49:53.616
SOMEBODY CLUE ME IN.

‐ I'D KILL HIM.
‐ [scoffs]

50:02.500 --> 50:04.376
‐ I WOULD.
‐ EXACTLY, MAN.

50:04.460 --> 50:06.754
SO I LET HIM GET IN THERE
AND GET SETTLED.

50:06.837 --> 50:07.963
I WALK OVER TO THE DOOR.

50:08.047 --> 50:12.510
I KICK IT IN, BAM.
POP HIM IN THE CHEST.

50:12.593 --> 50:14.011
TWICE.

50:14.011 --> 50:17.056
‐ WHO'S GOING TO FIGHT
WITH PANTS AROUND THEIR ANKLES?

50:17.139 --> 50:19.308
‐ [laughing]
‐ MY MAN.

50:23.646 --> 50:26.106
‐ I NEED TO CHECK
