01:17.995 --> 01:20.987
<i>People do not give it credence
that a young girl could leave home</i>

01:21.123 --> 01:24.115
<i>and go off in the wintertime
to avenge her father's blood.</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:26.495
<i>But it did happen.</i>

01:26.628 --> 01:30.166
<i>I was just 14 years of age when
a coward by the name of Tom Chaney</i>

01:30.299 --> 01:31.835
<i>shot my father down</i>

01:31.967 --> 01:34.379
<i>and robbed him of his life and his horse</i>

01:34.511 --> 01:38.345
<i>and two California gold pieces
that he carried in his trouser band.</i>

01:39.516 --> 01:41.177
<i>Chaney was a hired man</i>

01:41.310 --> 01:43.266
<i>and Papa had taken him
up to Fort Smith</i>

01:43.353 --> 01:46.516
<i>to help lead back a string of
Mustang ponies he'd bought.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:51.024
<i>In town,
Chaney had fallen to drink and cards</i>

01:51.361 --> 01:53.352
<i>and lost all his money.</i>

01:53.822 --> 01:56.188
<i>He got it into his head
he was being cheated</i>

01:56.325 --> 01:59.533
<i>and went back to the boarding house
for his Henry rifle.</i>

01:59.661 --> 02:03.495
<i>When Papa tried to intervene,
Chaney shot him.</i>

02:05.417 --> 02:06.873
<i>Chaney fled.</i>

02:10.672 --> 02:12.378
<i>He could have walked his horse,</i>

02:12.507 --> 02:16.216
<i>for not a soul in that city
could be bothered to give chase.</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:20.804
<i>No doubt Chaney fancied himself
scot-free.</i>

02:22.726 --> 02:24.387
<i>But he was wrong.</i>

02:24.728 --> 02:28.220
<i>You must pay for everything
in this world, one way and another.</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:32.895
<i>There is nothing free,
except the grace of God.</i>

03:00.055 --> 03:01.545
All right!

03:22.411 --> 03:23.776
Is that the man?

03:24.788 --> 03:25.868
That is my father.

03:25.956 --> 03:30.120
If you would like to kiss him,
it would be all right.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.410
He's gone home. Praise the Lord.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.708
Why is it so much?

03:36.258 --> 03:39.045
The quality of the cask et
and of the embalming.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.590
The lifelike appearance
requires time and art.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.594
And the chemicals come dear.
The particulars are in your bill.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.644
If you'd like to kiss him,
it would be all right.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.688
Thank you. The spirit has flown.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.561
Your wire said $50.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.484
You did not specify
that he was to be shipped.

03:58.572 --> 04:02.030
Well, $60 is every cent we have.
It leaves nothing for our board.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.699
Yarnell, you can see to the body's
transport to the train station

04:04.786 --> 04:06.993
and accompany it home.
I will have to sleep here tonight.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.696
I still have to collect father's things
and see to some other business.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.328
Your mama didn't say nothing
about you seeing to no business here.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.790
It is business Mama doesn't know about.
It's all right, Yarnell. I dismiss you.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.042
- I'm not sure...
- Tell Mama not to sign anything

04:18.133 --> 04:21.250
until I return home and see that Papa
is buried in his Mason's apron.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.716
Your terms are agreeable
if I may pass the night here.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.967
Here? Among these people?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.554
These people?

04:30.645 --> 04:32.476
I'm expecting three more souls.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.813
Sullivan, Smith,

04:35.776 --> 04:37.391
and H is Tongue In The Rain.

04:37.486 --> 04:41.570
Ladies and gentlemen,
beware and train up your children

04:41.656 --> 04:43.146
in the way that they should go.

04:43.825 --> 04:47.363
You see what has become of me
because of drink.

04:47.788 --> 04:53.249
I killed a man in a trifling quarrel
over a pocket-knife.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.869
If I had have received good instruction
as a child...

04:56.963 --> 05:00.251
- Can you point out the sheriff?
- Him with the mustaches.

05:00.342 --> 05:03.129
...I would be with
my wife and children today.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.336
I do not know
what is to become of them.

05:06.014 --> 05:10.257
But I hope and pray
that you will not slight them

05:10.560 --> 05:15.145
and compel them
to go into low company.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.022
Stop whimpering, boy!

05:23.406 --> 05:28.321
Well, I killed the wrong man
is the which-of-why I'm here.

05:30.121 --> 05:33.113
Had I killed the man I meant to,
I don't believe I'd have been convicted.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.499
I see men out there in that crowd
is worse than me.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.163
Okay.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.839
Before I am hanged,
I would like to say...

05:58.900 --> 06:00.481
No, we ain't arrested him.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.527
Ain't caught up to him.
He lit out for the Territory.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.022
I would think that he's throwed in
with Lucky Ned Pepper,

06:07.117 --> 06:10.530
whose gang robbed a mail hack
yesterday on the Poteau River.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.618
Why are you not looking for him?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.697
I have no authority in the Indian Nation.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.874
Tom Chaney is the business
of the U.S. Marshals now.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.205
- When will they arrest him?
- Not soon, I'm afraid.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.380
The marshals are not well staffed,
and I'll tell you frankly,

06:23.550 --> 06:27.134
Chaney is at the end of a long list
of fugitives and malefactors.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.428
Could I hire a marshal
to pursue Tom Chaney?

06:30.974 --> 06:33.465
You have a lot of experience
with bounty hunters, do you?

06:33.643 --> 06:36.305
That is a silly question.
I am here to settle my father's affairs.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.887
- All alone?
- I am the person for it.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.391
Mama was never any good at sums
and she could hardly spell "cat".

06:42.485 --> 06:44.316
I intend to see Papa's killer hanged.

06:44.404 --> 06:48.397
Well, nothing prevents you from offering
a reward and so informing the marshals.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.903
It would have to be real money, though,
to be persuasive.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.030
Chaney is across the river
in the Choctaw Nation.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.453
I will see to the money.
Who's the best marshal?

06:56.499 --> 06:58.330
I would have to weigh that.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.534
William Waters is the best tracker.

07:00.629 --> 07:04.213
He's half Comanche and it is something
to see him cut for sign.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.756
The meanest is Rooster Cogburn.

07:07.052 --> 07:11.170
He is a pitiless man, double tough,
and fear don't enter into his thinking.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.255
He loves to pull a cork.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.266
The best is probably L.T. Quinn.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.348
He brings his prisoners in alive.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.521
He may let one slip by now and again

07:21.608 --> 07:25.851
but he believes that even the worst
of men is entitled to a fair shake.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.270
Where can I find this Rooster?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.694
The jakes is occupied.

07:31.785 --> 07:35.619
I know it is occupied, Mr. Cogburn.
As I said, I have business with you.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.700
I have prior business.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.036
You have been at it for quite some time,
Mr. Cogburn.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.543
There is no clock on my business!

07:43.630 --> 07:46.542
To hell with you!
How did you stalk me here?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.878
The sheriff told me to look in the saloon.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.802
In the saloon, they referred me here.
We must talk.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.884
Women ain't allowed in the saloon.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.217
I was not there as a customer.
I am 14 years old.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.225
Well, the jakes is occupied.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.811
Will be for some time.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.815
Good evening.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.584
If you would like to sleep in a coffin,
it would be all right.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.194
How much are you paying for cotton?

08:52.991 --> 08:56.575
Nine and a half for low middling
and ten for ordinary.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.489
We got most of ours out early.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.580
Sold it to the Woodson Brothers
in Little Rock for 11 cents.

09:02.751 --> 09:06.790
Then I suggest you take the balance
of it to the Woodson Brothers.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.129
We took the balance to Woodson.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.920
We got ten and a half.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.294
Why did you come here to tell me this?

09:16.431 --> 09:18.513
I thought we might shop around up here
next year,

09:18.641 --> 09:21.633
but I guess we're doing all right
in Little Rock.

09:21.770 --> 09:22.976
I'm Mattie Ross.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.937
Daughter of Frank Ross.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.354
A tragic thing.

09:30.487 --> 09:34.526
May I say your father impressed me
with his manly qualities.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.615
He was a close trader
but he acted the gentleman.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.198
Well, I propose to sell those ponies
back to you that my father bought.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.946
That, I fear, is out of the question.

09:43.041 --> 09:46.158
I will see that they're shipped to you
at my earliest convenience.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.875
We don't want the ponies now.
We don't need 'em.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.289
Well, that hardly concerns me.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.336
Your father bought the ponies
and paid for them

09:51.466 --> 09:54.173
and there is an end of it.
I have the bill of sale.

09:54.469 --> 09:58.132
And I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse
that was stolen from your stable.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.015
You'll have to take that up
with the man who stole the horse.

10:03.144 --> 10:06.978
Tom Chaney stole the horse while
it was in your care. You are responsible.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.722
I admire your sand

10:09.859 --> 10:12.646
but I believe you will find
I'm not liable for such claims.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.353
You were the custodian.
If you were a bank and were robbed,

10:15.490 --> 10:17.697
you could not simply tell the depositors
to go hang.

10:17.826 --> 10:22.195
I do not entertain hypotheticals.
The world as it is is vexing enough.

10:23.164 --> 10:27.999
Secondly, your valuation of the horse
is high by about $200. How old are you?

10:28.086 --> 10:30.293
If anything, my price is low.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.995
Judy is a fine racing mare.

10:32.507 --> 10:35.749
I've seen her jump an eight-rail fence
with a heavy rider. I'm 14.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.342
Well, that's all very interesting.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.509
The ponies are yours. Take them.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.511
Your father's horse was stolen
by a murderous criminal.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.309
I had provided reasonable protection
for the creature

10:47.397 --> 10:49.228
as per our implicit agreement.

10:49.732 --> 10:53.224
My watchman had his teeth knocked out
and can take only soup.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.652
- I will take it to law.
- You have no case.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.821
Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle,
Arkansas may think otherwise,

10:58.908 --> 11:02.400
as might a jury, petitioned by
a widow and three small children.

11:05.415 --> 11:09.579
I will pay $200 to your father's estate

11:09.711 --> 11:11.997
when I have in my hand
a letter from your lawyer

11:12.088 --> 11:15.501
absolving me of all liability from
the beginning of the world to date...

11:15.592 --> 11:17.173
I will take $200 for Judy,

11:17.260 --> 11:21.253
plus $ 100 for the ponies and $25
for the gray horse that Tom Chaney left.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.425
He was easily worth $40.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.423
That is $325 total.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.180
The ponies have no part in it.
I will not buy them.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.387
Then the price for Judy is $325.

11:30.940 --> 11:35.024
I would not pay $325
for a winged Pegasus!

11:35.111 --> 11:37.602
As for the gray horse,
it does not belong to you.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.029
The gray horse was lent to Tom Chaney
by my father.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.276
Chaney only had the use of him.

11:43.286 --> 11:47.620
I will pay $225 and keep the gray horse.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.456
- I don't want the ponies.
- I cannot accept that.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.205
There will be no settlement after I leave
this office. It will go to law.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.287
All right, this is my last offer.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.626
$250.

11:57.759 --> 12:01.047
For that I get the release
previously discussed

12:01.137 --> 12:03.378
and I keep your father's saddle.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.384
The gray horse is not yours to sell.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.807
The saddle is not for sale. I will keep it.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.722
Lawyer Daggett will prove ownership
of the gray horse.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.473
He will come after you
with a writ of replevin.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.895
- A what?
- A writ of replevin.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.440
All right, now listen very carefully,
as I will not bargain further.

12:16.611 --> 12:20.320
I will take the ponies back,
and the gray horse, which is mine,

12:20.448 --> 12:24.316
and settle for $300.

12:24.410 --> 12:28.779
Now, you must take that or leave it
and I do not much care which it is.

12:31.292 --> 12:35.456
Lawyer Daggett would not wish me
to consider anything under $325.

12:36.130 --> 12:40.840
But I will settle for $320
if I am given the $20 in advance.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.758
Now, here is what I have to say
about that saddle.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.181
<i>Frank Ross's daughter.</i>

12:52.689 --> 12:55.146
Oh, my poor child.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.145
My poor child.

12:59.195 --> 13:03.188
Are you gonna be stayin' with us or are
you hurrying back home to your mama?

13:03.324 --> 13:05.531
I'll stay here if you can have me.

13:05.660 --> 13:09.994
I just spent last night at the undertaker's
in the company of three corpses.

13:10.164 --> 13:13.998
I felt like Ezekiel
in the Valley of the Dry Bones.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.533
Well, God bless you.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.879
You'll be rooming with Grandma Turner.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.043
We've had to double up,

13:21.175 --> 13:24.338
what with all the people in town
come to see the hanging.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.464
This was in your poor father's room.

13:29.809 --> 13:34.223
That is everything.
There are no light fingers in this house.

13:42.572 --> 13:46.406
If you need something
for to tote the gun around,

13:46.534 --> 13:49.901
I can give you
an empty flour sack for a nickel.

14:19.567 --> 14:23.276
...I could get him to talk sense
about what he found up there.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.441
And we were close enough
that Deputy Marshal Potter and me

14:26.574 --> 14:29.566
thought we'd better ride over ourselves
and investigate.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.281
What did you see when you arrived?

14:32.413 --> 14:36.372
Old woman was out in the yard, dead,

14:36.459 --> 14:38.620
with blowflies on her face.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.124
The old man was inside with
his breast blown open by a scattergun

14:42.256 --> 14:44.121
and his feet burned.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.207
He was still alive but just was.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.294
Said it was them two Wharton boys
done it. Rode up drunk...

14:49.430 --> 14:53.639
- Objection. Hearsay.
- Dying declaration, Your Honor.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.134
Objection's overruled.
Proceed, Mr. Cogburn.

14:56.813 --> 15:00.055
Them two Wharton boys,
that'd be Odus and C C,

15:00.149 --> 15:03.141
throwed down on him
and asked him where his money was.

15:03.277 --> 15:07.566
When he wouldn't tell 'em,
they lit pine knots, held them to his feet.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.232
He told them
the money was in a fruit jar,

15:11.327 --> 15:14.490
under a gray rock
at the corner of the smokehouse.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.409
- And then?
- Well, he died on us.

15:17.500 --> 15:21.163
- Passed away in considerable pain.
- What did you do then?

15:21.295 --> 15:24.332
Me and Marshal Potter
went out to the smokehouse.

15:24.465 --> 15:28.003
And that rock had been moved and
the jar with the money in it was gone.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.003
- Objection. Speculative.
- Sustained.

15:31.139 --> 15:34.757
You found a flat gray rock in the corner
of the smokehouse

15:34.851 --> 15:36.432
with a hollowed-out space beneath it...

15:36.519 --> 15:40.103
If the prosecutor's going to give
evidence, I suggest he be sworn.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.931
Mr. Cogburn, what did you find,
if anything,

15:43.025 --> 15:44.686
in the corner of that smokehouse?

15:44.819 --> 15:45.899
Found a flat gray rock

15:45.987 --> 15:48.444
with a hollowed-out space
under it and nothing there.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.612
- Then what did you...
- No jar or nothing.

15:50.700 --> 15:54.613
- What did you do then?
- Well, rode up to the Whartons'

15:54.704 --> 15:56.786
near where the North Fork
strikes the Canadian.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.455
- What did you find?
- Branch of the Canadian.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.498
I had my glass.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.536
We spotted them two boys
and their old daddy, Aaron,

16:04.672 --> 16:06.879
down the creek bank with some hogs.

16:07.675 --> 16:12.044
They'd killed a shoat, had a fire built
under a wash pot for scalding water.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.546
- What did you do?
- Announced we was U.S. Marshals.

16:14.682 --> 16:18.675
I hollered out to Aaron
that we needed to talk to his two boys.

16:19.729 --> 16:23.893
He raised an axe and commenced to
cussing us and blackguarding this court.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.561
What did you do then?

16:26.903 --> 16:30.566
Backed away from the axe
and tried to talk some sense into him.

16:32.742 --> 16:36.109
While this was going on, CC,
he edges over to the wash pot there,

16:36.204 --> 16:39.367
behind the steam,
and picks up a shotgun.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.323
Potter seen him, but it was too late.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.540
CC Wharton pulled down on Potter
with one barrel

16:46.631 --> 16:49.714
and turned to do the same for me
and I shot him.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.502
The old man raised the axe
and I shot him.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.838
Odus lit out and I shot him.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.721
CC Wharton and Aaron Wharton
were dead when they hit the ground.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.555
Odus was just winged.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.937
Did you find the jar with the $ 120 in it?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.984
- Leading.
- Sustained.

17:11.072 --> 17:14.906
- What happened then?
- I found the jar with $ 120 in it.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.821
What became of Odus Wharton?

17:18.162 --> 17:20.073
There he sits.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.789
You may ask, Mr. Goudy.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.867
Thank you, Mr. Barlow.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.424
Mr. Cogburn,

17:41.519 --> 17:45.808
in your four years as U.S. Marshal,
how many men have you shot?

17:47.441 --> 17:49.102
I never shot nobody I didn't have to.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.775
Well, that was not the question.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.102
How many?

17:54.490 --> 17:55.775
Shot or killed?

17:55.866 --> 17:59.779
Let us restrict it to "killed" so that
we may have a manageable figure.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.533
About 12, 15.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.532
Stopping men in flight,
defending myself, et cetera.

18:05.876 --> 18:09.289
Around 12, he says, or 15.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.880
So many you cannot keep
a precise count.

18:12.967 --> 18:16.835
I have examined the records
and can supply the accurate figure.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.598
I believe them two Wharton boys
makes it 23.

18:22.685 --> 18:26.098
And how many members
of this one family,

18:26.188 --> 18:28.144
the Wharton family, have you killed?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.522
Immediate or...

18:30.610 --> 18:33.022
Did you also shoot
Dub Wharton, brother,

18:33.112 --> 18:34.943
and Clete Wharton, half-brother?

18:36.032 --> 18:40.116
Clete was selling ardent spirits to the
Cherokee. Come at me with a kingbolt.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.487
A kingbolt?

18:42.246 --> 18:49.038
You were armed and he advanced upon
you with nothing more than a kingbolt?

18:49.420 --> 18:50.580
From a wagon tongue?

18:50.671 --> 18:53.538
I've seen men badly tore up
with nothing bigger than a kingbolt.

18:53.633 --> 18:57.091
- I defended myself.
- Returning to the other encounter,

18:57.178 --> 19:00.136
with Aaron Wharton
and his two remaining sons.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.965
You sprang from cover
with your revolver in hand.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.891
- I did.
- Loaded and cocked?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.636
If it ain't loaded and cocked,
it don't shoot.

19:09.148 --> 19:13.733
And like his son, Aaron Wharton
advanced against an armed man?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.064
He was armed, he had an axe raised!

19:16.155 --> 19:19.022
I believe you testified you backed away
from Aaron Wharton?

19:19.116 --> 19:21.482
- That's right.
- Which direction were you going?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.868
I always go backwards
when I'm backing up.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.870
Very amusing.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.373
Now, he advanced upon you much
in the manner of Clete Wharton,

19:33.464 --> 19:36.251
menacing you with that little old kingbolt

19:36.342 --> 19:38.503
or rolled-up newspaper,
or whatever it was.

19:38.594 --> 19:42.507
Yes, sir. He commenced to cussing
and laying about with threats.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.010
And you were backing away?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.846
How many steps
before the shooting started?

19:50.731 --> 19:52.312
Seven, eight steps.

19:52.400 --> 19:57.019
So, Aaron Wharton, keeping pace,
advancing away from his campfire,

19:57.530 --> 19:59.862
seven, eight steps.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.282
What would that be, 15, 20 feet?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.318
I suppose.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.576
Will you explain to this jury,
Mr. Cogburn,

20:08.666 --> 20:12.284
why Mr. Wharton was found
immediately by his wash pot,

20:12.378 --> 20:15.620
one arm in the fire,
his sleeve and hand smoldering?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.580
Did you move the body
after you shot him?

20:17.675 --> 20:19.131
Why would I do that?

20:19.301 --> 20:21.587
You did not drag the body
over to the fire, fling his arm in?

20:21.679 --> 20:22.714
No, sir.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.887
Two witnesses
who arrived on the scene

20:24.974 --> 20:27.090
will testify to the location of the body.

20:27.184 --> 20:30.142
You do not remember moving the body!

20:30.229 --> 20:33.437
So it was a cold-blooded bushwhack,

20:33.524 --> 20:35.856
while poor Mr. Wharton
was tending to his campfire.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.604
Objection!

20:37.945 --> 20:42.109
If that's where the body was, I might
have moved him. I do not remember.

20:42.408 --> 20:45.491
Why would you move the body,
Mr. Cogburn?

20:45.703 --> 20:49.241
Them hogs rooting around,
they might have moved him.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.369
I do not remember.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.745
Pencil-neck son of a bitch.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.046
Rooster Cogburn?

20:59.133 --> 21:01.044
- What is it?
- I'd like to talk to you a minute.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.591
What is it?

21:03.554 --> 21:06.421
They tell me you're a man with true grit.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.680
What do you want, girl?
Speak up, it's suppertime.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.432
Let me do that.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.479
Your makings are too dry.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.478
I'm looking for the man who shot
and killed my father, Frank Ross,

21:18.569 --> 21:20.025
in front of the Monarch Boarding House.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.152
The man's name is Tom Chaney.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.857
They say he's over in Indian Territory
and I need somebody to go after him.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.775
What's your name, girl?

21:28.287 --> 21:31.700
My name is Mattie Ross.
We're located in Yell County.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.702
My mother is at home looking
after my sister Victoria

21:33.793 --> 21:34.873
and my brother Little Frank.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.418
Best go home to them.
They will need help with the churning.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.371
There is a fugitive warrant
out for Chaney.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.127
The government will pay you $2
for bringing him in

21:42.218 --> 21:44.425
plus 10 cents a mile for each of you.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.673
On top of that,
I will pay you a $50 reward.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.889
What are you?

21:51.268 --> 21:53.304
What've you got there in your poke?

21:55.022 --> 21:58.059
My God, a Colt's Dragoon.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.898
You're no bigger than a corn nubbin.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.976
What're you doing
with a pistol like that?

22:02.071 --> 22:04.733
- I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it.
- Kill Tom Chaney?

22:04.824 --> 22:06.485
If the law fails to do so.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.942
That piece will do the job for you,
if you find a high stump to rest it on

22:10.037 --> 22:11.493
and a wall to put behind you.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.824
Nobody here knew my father

22:12.915 --> 22:15.702
and I'm afraid nothing is going to be
done about Chaney except I do it.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.998
My brother is a child and my mother
is indecisive and hobbled by grief.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.164
I don't believe you have $50.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.591
I have a contract with Colonel Stonehill
which he will make payment on

22:25.678 --> 22:29.091
tomorrow or the next day
once a lawyer countersigns.

22:31.475 --> 22:35.263
I don't believe in fairy tales or sermons
or stories about money, baby sister.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.515
But thanks for the cigarette.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.435
Isn't your mama
expecting you home, dear?

23:22.526 --> 23:24.858
My business is not yet finished.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.024
Mrs. Floyd, have any rooms opened up?

23:28.449 --> 23:31.782
Grandma Turner is...
The bed is quite narrow.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.826
The second-floor back did open up

23:34.914 --> 23:38.406
but that gentleman on the porch
has just taken it.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.450
But don't worry yourself, dear.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.911
You're not disturbing Grandma Turner.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.791
My name is LaBoeuf.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.135
I've just come from Yell County.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.638
We have no rodeo clowns
in Yell County.

24:40.938 --> 24:43.771
A saucy line will not get you far with me.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.306
I saw your mother yesterday morning.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.729
She said for you to come right on home.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.028
What was your business there?

25:02.084 --> 25:04.416
This is a man I think you know.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.666
You called him Tom Chaney, I believe.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.294
Though, in the months I've been
tracking him, he has used the names

25:11.385 --> 25:15.094
Theron Chelmsford,
John Todd Andersen, and others.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.677
He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana,
and Pine Bluff, Arkansas,

25:18.767 --> 25:21.053
before turning up at your father's place.

25:21.145 --> 25:24.979
Why did you not catch him in Pine Bluff,
Arkansas, or Monroe, Louisiana?

25:25.941 --> 25:27.351
He is a crafty one.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.642
I thought him slow-witted, myself.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.026
That was his act.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.196
It was a good one.
Are you some kind of law?

25:35.576 --> 25:37.112
That's right.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.077
I'm a Texas Ranger.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.199
That may make you a big noise
in that state.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.494
In Arkansas, you should mind
that your Texas trappings and title

25:48.589 --> 25:50.420
do not make you an object of fun.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.215
Why have you been ineffectually
pursuing Chaney?

25:55.679 --> 25:59.217
He shot and killed a state senator
named Bibbs in Waco, Texas.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.136
The Bibbs family put out a reward.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.638
How came Chaney
to shoot a state senator?

26:03.729 --> 26:05.594
My understanding is
there was an argument about a dog.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.680
Do you know anything about
the whereabouts of Chaney?

26:08.233 --> 26:11.316
He is in the Territory, and I hold out
little hope for you earning your bounty.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.860
- Why is that?
- My man will beat you to it.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.563
I have hired a deputy marshal,
the toughest one they have.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.398
And he's familiar
with the Lucky Ned Pepper gang

26:18.494 --> 26:19.904
they say Chaney's tied up with.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.990
Well, I will throw in
with you and your marshal.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.162
No.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.992
- Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.
- It'll be to our mutual advantage.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.250
Your marshal, I presume,
knows the Territory. I know Chaney.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.751
It is at least a two-man job
taking him alive.

26:34.176 --> 26:37.384
When Chaney is taken,
he's coming back to Fort Smith to hang.

26:37.471 --> 26:40.554
I'm not having him go to Texas
to hang for shooting some senator.

26:40.641 --> 26:42.973
It is not important where he hangs, is it?

26:43.060 --> 26:45.597
It is to me. Is it to you?

26:45.687 --> 26:49.145
It means a great deal of money to me.
It's been many months' work.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.316
I'm sorry that you are paid piecework
and not on wages,

26:52.820 --> 26:55.937
and that you have been eluded
the winter long by a halfwit.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.567
You give out very little sugar
with your pronouncements.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.870
While I sat there watching you,
I gave some thought to stealing a kiss,

27:04.957 --> 27:08.370
though you are very young and sick
and unattractive to boot.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.827
But now I have a mind to give you
five or six good licks with my belt.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.751
One would be as unpleasant
as the other.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.131
If you wet your comb,
it might tame that cowlick.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.803
<i>Mattie, I wish you would leave
these matters entirely to me,</i>

27:24.893 --> 27:27.885
<i>or at the very least, do me
the courtesy of consulting me</i>

27:27.980 --> 27:29.720
<i>before entering such agreements.</i>

27:30.023 --> 27:31.263
<i>I am not scolding you</i>

27:31.358 --> 27:35.647
<i>but I am saying your headstrong ways
will lead you into a tight corner one day.</i>

27:36.530 --> 27:39.488
<i>I trust the enclosed document
will let you conclude your business</i>

27:39.575 --> 27:41.566
<i>and return to Yell County.</i>

27:42.202 --> 27:44.443
<i>Yours, J. Noble Daggett.</i>

27:44.621 --> 27:47.203
I was as bad yesterday
as you look today.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.535
I was forced to share a bed
with Grandma Turner.

27:50.544 --> 27:53.627
I am not acquainted
with Grandma Turner.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.250
If she is a resident of this city,

27:55.340 --> 27:58.423
it does not surprise me
that she carries disease.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.132
This malarial place
has ruined my health,

28:03.223 --> 28:05.214
as it has my finances.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.764
I owe you money.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.342
You have not traded poorly.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.223
Certainly not!

28:11.064 --> 28:14.807
I am paying you for a horse
I do not possess

28:14.902 --> 28:18.110
and have bought back
a string of useless ponies

28:18.197 --> 28:20.028
which I cannot sell again.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.697
- You're forgetting the gray horse.
- Crow bait!

28:22.784 --> 28:24.615
You are looking at the thing
in the wrong light.

28:24.703 --> 28:28.116
I am looking at it
in the light of God's eternal truth.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.868
Your illness is putting you
down in the dumps.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.041
You will soon find a good buyer
for the ponies.

28:33.128 --> 28:36.370
I have a tentative offer of $ 10 per head

28:37.174 --> 28:39.586
from the Pfitzer Soap Works
of Little Rock.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.668
It would be a shame to destroy
such spirited horseflesh.

28:42.763 --> 28:46.255
So it would.
I am confident the deal will fall through.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.802
Look here. I need a pony.
And I will pay $ 10 for one of them.

28:52.022 --> 28:55.810
No, that's the lot price. No, no...
Wait a minute.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.066
Are we trading again?

29:00.530 --> 29:02.395
This one's beautiful.

29:20.342 --> 29:23.254
He don't know he got a rider.
You too light.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.086
Easy, boy.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.847
He think he got a horsefly on him.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.927
He's very spirited.
I'll call him Little Blackie.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.558
That's a good name.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.520
What does he like for a treat?

29:39.611 --> 29:41.772
Well, ma'am, he's a horse.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.770
So he likes apples.

29:45.409 --> 29:48.025
- Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.
- No, ma'am.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.611
I ain't supposed to utter your name!

29:52.916 --> 29:54.497
See? Sleep.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.792
That is fine. I will wake him.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.878
Marshal Cogburn?

30:01.967 --> 30:03.707
It is I, Mattie Ross, your employer.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.007
- How long till you are ready to go?
- Go where?

30:08.098 --> 30:10.214
Into the Indian Territory,
in pursuit of Tom Chaney.

30:12.644 --> 30:16.228
You're the bereaved girl
with stories of El Dorado.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.480
How much money you got there?

30:19.568 --> 30:22.731
I said $50 to retrieve Chaney.
You did not believe me?

30:23.322 --> 30:25.313
I did not know.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.693
You are a hard one to figure.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.524
How long for you
to make ready to depart?

30:29.619 --> 30:31.780
Well, hold on, sis.

30:33.165 --> 30:36.657
I remember your offer
but I do not remember agreeing to it.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.084
If I'm to go up against Ned Pepper,

30:40.839 --> 30:44.377
I will need $ 100.
That much I can tell you. $ 100.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.587
To retrieve your man, $ 100.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.010
I will take that $50 in advance.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.264
There will be expenses.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.436
You are trying to take advantage of me.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.514
I'm giving you the children's rate.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.266
I'm not a sharper.

31:02.361 --> 31:06.024
I'm an old man sleeping in a rope bed
in a room behind a Chinese grocery.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.235
- I have nothing.
- You want to be kept in whiskey.

31:09.826 --> 31:12.659
I don't need to buy that. I confiscate it.

31:13.163 --> 31:14.699
I'm an officer of the court.

31:15.332 --> 31:16.617
Thank you.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.699
$ 100, that's the rate.

31:19.211 --> 31:22.169
I shall not niggle.
Can we depart this afternoon?

31:23.131 --> 31:24.871
We?

31:25.342 --> 31:27.549
You are not going. That is no part of it.

31:27.636 --> 31:31.003
You have misjudged me if you think
I am silly enough to give you $50

31:31.098 --> 31:32.258
and watch you simply ride off.

31:32.349 --> 31:33.930
I'm a bonded U.S. Marshal.

31:34.017 --> 31:36.724
That weighs but little with me.
I will see the thing done.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.473
Goddamn ducks.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.305
I can't go after Ned Pepper
and a band of hard men

31:41.400 --> 31:44.358
- and look after a baby at the same time.
- I am not a baby.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.309
I won't be stopping at boarding houses

31:46.405 --> 31:49.147
where there's warm beds
and hot grub on the table.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.323
I'll be traveling fast and eating light.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.777
What little sleeping is done
will take place on the ground.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.907
I have slept out at night before.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.157
Papa took me and Little Frank coon
hunting last summer on the Petit Jean.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.417
We were in the woods all night.

32:02.504 --> 32:05.462
We sat around a big fire
and Yarnell told ghost stories.

32:05.549 --> 32:06.584
We had a good time.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.462
Coon hunting?

32:10.011 --> 32:11.501
This ain't no coon hunt.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.302
It is the same idea as a coon hunt.

32:13.390 --> 32:14.926
It don't come within 40 miles
of being a coon hunt.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.098
You're just tryin' to make your work
sound harder than it is.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.425
Here is the money.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.726
I aim to get Tom Chaney

32:19.813 --> 32:22.179
and if you are not game
I will find somebody who is game.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.935
All I've heard out of you so far is talk.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.686
I know you can drink whiskey and snore

32:25.777 --> 32:27.642
and spit and wallow in filth
and bemoan your station.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.273
The rest has been braggadocio.

32:29.489 --> 32:32.151
They told me you had grit
and that is why I came to you.

32:32.242 --> 32:33.322
I'm not paying for talk.

32:33.410 --> 32:36.447
I can get all the talk I need and more
at the Monarch Boarding House.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.873
Leave your money.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.917
Meet me here at 7: 00
tomorrow morning.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.087
We'll begin our coon hunt.

32:55.724 --> 32:57.305
<i>Dearest Mother,</i>

32:58.435 --> 33:00.767
<i>I'm about to embark
on a great adventure.</i>

33:02.272 --> 33:04.263
<i>I have learned that Tom Chaney
has fled into the wild</i>

33:04.357 --> 33:07.144
<i>and I shall assist the authorities
in pursuit.</i>

33:07.235 --> 33:09.817
<i>You know that Papa would want me
to be firm in the right,</i>

33:09.905 --> 33:11.861
<i>as he always was.</i>

33:12.616 --> 33:14.607
<i>So do not fear on my account.</i>

33:15.285 --> 33:17.526
<i>Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,</i>

33:17.621 --> 33:19.737
<i>I shall fear no evil.</i>

33:19.831 --> 33:23.323
<i>The author of all things watches
over me and I have a fine horse.</i>

33:24.294 --> 33:27.411
<i>Kiss Little Frankie for me
and pinch Violet's cheek.</i>

33:27.506 --> 33:29.963
<i>Papa's death will soon be avenged.</i>

33:32.636 --> 33:34.968
<i>I am off for the Choctaw Nation.</i>

33:41.853 --> 33:43.218
Where is Marshal Cogburn?

33:43.313 --> 33:45.770
Went away. Left this.

33:50.487 --> 33:54.230
<i>Here inside is a train ticket
for your return home. Use it.</i>

33:54.324 --> 33:58.567
<i>By the time you read this, I will be
across the river in the Indian Nation.</i>

33:58.662 --> 34:02.826
<i>Pursuit would be futile.
I will return with your man Chaney.</i>

34:02.916 --> 34:05.703
<i>Leave me to my work.
Reuben Cogburn.</i>

34:14.511 --> 34:15.921
Is that Marshal Cogburn?

34:16.012 --> 34:18.424
- That is the man.
- Who's he with?

34:18.515 --> 34:19.971
I do not know.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.844
Take me across.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.808
So, you're the runaway.

34:23.895 --> 34:27.012
Marshal told me you'd show up.
I'm to present you to the sheriff.

34:27.107 --> 34:30.395
That is a story. Let go of my horse.
I have business across the river.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.402
If you don't turn around
and take me across,

34:34.489 --> 34:37.401
you may find yourself in court
where you don't want to be.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.198
I have a good lawyer.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.408
Hey!

34:49.963 --> 34:51.954
Go, Little Blackie! Come on!

36:04.746 --> 36:06.532
That is quite a horse.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.868
I will give you $ 10 for him.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.619
From the money you stole from me?

36:10.710 --> 36:13.076
That was not stolen.
I'm out for your man.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.786
I was to accompany you.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.380
If I do not, there is no agreement
and my money was stolen.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.708
Marshal, put this child back on the ferry.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.676
It's a long road, and time is a-wasting.

36:21.763 --> 36:25.221
If I go back, it is to the U.S. Marshals
Office to report the theft of my money.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.596
And futile, Marshal Cogburn,
"Pursuit would be futile,"

36:28.687 --> 36:30.678
is not spelt F-U-D-E-L.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.739
It is time for your spanking.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.993
Now you will do as the grown-ups say

36:48.039 --> 36:51.281
or I will get myself a birch switch
and stripe your leg!

36:55.004 --> 36:57.165
Are you going to let him do this,
Marshal?

37:00.927 --> 37:03.134
No, I don't believe I will.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.884
- Put your switch away, LaBoeuf.
- I aim to finish what I started.

37:07.267 --> 37:11.351
That will be the biggest mistake you
ever made, you Texas brush-popper.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.196
Hoorawed by a little girl.

37:40.049 --> 37:42.165
I am not accustomed to so large a fire.

37:43.595 --> 37:48.430
In Texas, we will make do with
a fire of little more than twigs

37:50.602 --> 37:54.060
or buffalo chips,
to heat the night's ration of beans.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.684
And it is Ranger policy

37:56.775 --> 38:00.233
never to make your camp
in the same place as your cookfire.

38:00.320 --> 38:04.029
Very imprudent to make your presence
known in unsettled country.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.079
How do you know
Bagby will have intelligence?

38:13.583 --> 38:14.993
He has a store.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.917
That makes him an authority
on movements in the Territory?

38:18.046 --> 38:20.037
We have entered a wild place.

38:20.465 --> 38:23.878
And anyone coming in,
wanting any kind of supply,

38:24.594 --> 38:26.425
cannot pick and choose his portal.

38:28.765 --> 38:29.925
That is a piece of foolishness.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.507
All the snakes are asleep
this time of year.

38:32.602 --> 38:35.639
- They have been known to wake up.
- Let me have a rope, too.

38:35.730 --> 38:39.598
A snake would not bother you.
You are too little and bony.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.477
You should fetch water for the morning
and put it by the fire.

38:43.571 --> 38:46.529
- The creek's gonna ice over tonight.
- I'm not going down there again.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.652
If you want any more water,
you could fetch it yourself.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.610
You're lucky to be traveling in a place
where a spring is so handy.

38:52.288 --> 38:56.201
In my country, you can ride for days
and see no groundwater.

38:56.292 --> 38:59.204
I have lapped filthy water
from a hoofprint

38:59.295 --> 39:00.580
and was glad to have it.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.005
If I ever meet one of you Texas waddies

39:04.092 --> 39:06.504
who says he has never drank water
out of a horse track,

39:06.594 --> 39:09.210
I think I'll shake his hand
and give him a Daniel Webster cigar.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.261
You do not believe it?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.886
I believed it the first 25 times I heard it.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.968
Maybe... Maybe it is true.

39:17.981 --> 39:20.814
Maybe lapping water off the ground
is Ranger policy.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.892
You are getting ready
to show your ignorance now, Cogburn.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.729
I don't mind a little personal chaffing

39:26.823 --> 39:30.031
but I won't hear anything against
the Ranger troop from a man like you.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.203
How long you boys
been mounted on sheep down there?

39:36.291 --> 39:38.247
My white Appaloosa
will still be galloping

39:38.334 --> 39:41.076
when that big American stud of yours
is winded and collapsed.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.751
Now make another joke about it.

39:43.006 --> 39:45.748
You're only trying to put on a show
for this girl Mattie

39:45.842 --> 39:47.798
with what you must think
is a keen tongue.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.925
This is like women talking.

39:50.013 --> 39:51.128
Yes, that is the way.

39:51.598 --> 39:53.714
Make me out foolish in this girl's eyes.

39:54.392 --> 39:57.179
I think she has you pretty well figured.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.143
Would you two like to hear the story
of The Midnight Caller?

40:08.990 --> 40:10.651
One of you is gonna have
to be The Caller.

40:10.742 --> 40:11.777
And I will tell you what to say.

40:12.577 --> 40:15.364
And I will do all the other parts myself.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.264
- Good morning, Marshal.
- Morning.

40:41.356 --> 40:42.971
Where is Mr. LaBoeuf?

40:43.066 --> 40:46.058
Down by the creek,
performing his necessaries.

40:46.444 --> 40:50.312
Marshal Cogburn, I welcome the chance
for a private parley.

40:50.406 --> 40:54.570
I gather that you and Mr. LaBoeuf
have come to some sort of agreement.

40:54.661 --> 40:57.494
And as your employer, I believe
I have the right to know the particulars.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.617
The particulars is that we bring Chaney

41:00.708 --> 41:02.824
down to the magistrate
in San Saba, Texas,

41:02.919 --> 41:06.832
where they have a considerable reward
on offer, which we split.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.668
I did not want him brought to Texas,

41:09.759 --> 41:12.876
to have a Texas punishment
administered for a Texas crime.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.711
That was not our agreement.

41:14.806 --> 41:17.513
What you want is to have him
caught and punished.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.842
I want him to know that he is being
punished for killing my father.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.474
You can let him know that.
You can tell him to his face.

41:23.564 --> 41:26.852
You can spit on him
and make him eat sand out of the road.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.524
I will hold him down.

41:28.611 --> 41:32.524
If you want, I'll flay the flesh
off the soles of his feet

41:32.615 --> 41:35.231
and find you an Indian pepper
you can rub into the wound.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.032
Isn't that a $ 100 value?

41:37.120 --> 41:39.202
No, it is not.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.030
When I have bought and paid
for something, I will have my way.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.366
Why do you think I'm paying you
if not to have my way?

41:44.460 --> 41:48.999
It's time for you to learn you cannot have
your way in every little particular.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.590
If you find I fail to satisfy your terms,

41:52.677 --> 41:55.339
I will return your money
at the end of this expedition.

41:55.430 --> 41:57.421
Little Blackie and I are riding back
to the U.S. Marshals Office.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.301
- This is fraud.
- God damn it!

41:59.809 --> 42:02.642
- What's going on?
- This is a business conversation.

42:02.729 --> 42:03.844
Is that what you call it?

42:03.938 --> 42:06.725
It sounds to me like you're still being
hoorawed by a little girl.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.522
- Did you say hoorawed?
- That was the word.

42:08.609 --> 42:09.849
There is no hoorawing in it.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.480
My agreement
with the marshal antedates yours.

42:11.571 --> 42:14.483
- It has the force of law.
- The force of law?

42:14.699 --> 42:16.906
This man is a notorious thumper.

42:16.993 --> 42:20.360
He rode by the light of the moon
with Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson.

42:20.455 --> 42:22.696
Them men was patriots, Texas trash!

42:22.957 --> 42:24.822
They murdered women and children
in Lawrence, Kansas.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.828
That's a goddamn lie!

42:27.420 --> 42:28.705
What army was you in, mister?

42:28.796 --> 42:31.412
I was at Shreveport,
first with Kirby Smith...

42:31.507 --> 42:33.748
Yeah? What side was you on?

42:33.843 --> 42:35.799
I was in the army of Northern Virginia,
Cogburn,

42:35.887 --> 42:37.593
and I don't have to hang my head
when I say it.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.921
If you had served
with Captain Quantrill...

42:40.016 --> 42:41.096
Captain?

42:41.851 --> 42:44.092
Captain Quantrill indeed!

42:44.187 --> 42:47.554
- Best let this go, LaBoeuf.
- Captain of what?

42:51.277 --> 42:54.485
Good, then. There's not sufficient
dollars in the state of Texas

42:54.572 --> 42:57.109
to make it worth my while
and listen to your opinions.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.782
- Our agreement is nullified.
- That suits me.

43:00.328 --> 43:03.570
- It's each man for himself.
- Congratulations, Cogburn.

43:04.207 --> 43:06.869
You've graduated
from marauder to wet nurse.

43:17.011 --> 43:19.468
We don't need him, do we, Marshal?

43:21.724 --> 43:23.715
We'll miss his Sharps carbine.

43:24.685 --> 43:27.017
It's apt to get lively out here.

43:49.752 --> 43:50.867
Hey!

43:53.631 --> 43:54.837
Go!

44:01.889 --> 44:03.595
Stay here, sister.

44:03.683 --> 44:05.344
I will see Bagby.

44:27.582 --> 44:28.992
Has Chaney been here?

44:29.083 --> 44:32.450
No. Coke Hayes was, two days ago.

44:32.545 --> 44:36.003
Coke runs with Lucky Ned.
He bought supplies with this.

44:39.468 --> 44:41.129
This is Papa's gold piece.

44:41.387 --> 44:42.877
Tom Chaney, here we come.

44:42.972 --> 44:45.679
It's not the world's only
California gold piece.

44:45.975 --> 44:48.466
- They are rare here.
- They are rare.

44:49.312 --> 44:50.973
But if it is Chaney's,

44:51.314 --> 44:54.397
it could just as easily mean that
Lucky Ned and his gang fell upon him,

44:54.483 --> 44:56.348
as that he fell in with them.

44:56.444 --> 44:58.150
Chaney could be a corpse.

44:58.487 --> 45:01.479
That would be a bitter disappointment,
Marshal. What do we do?

45:01.574 --> 45:02.984
Pursue.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.613
Ned is unfinished business
for the marshals, anyhow,

45:05.703 --> 45:07.568
and when we have him
we'll also have Chaney

45:07.663 --> 45:09.654
or learn the whereabouts
of his body.

45:10.333 --> 45:11.914
Bagby didn't know which way they went,

45:12.001 --> 45:13.707
but now that we know
they come through here,

45:13.794 --> 45:16.035
they couldn't be going
but one of two ways,

45:16.631 --> 45:19.589
heading north towards
the Winding Stair Mountains,

45:19.675 --> 45:21.586
or pushing further west.

45:21.844 --> 45:23.960
I suspect north. More to rob.

45:24.222 --> 45:27.385
I bought an eating place
called The Green Frog,

45:27.475 --> 45:29.841
started calling myself Burroughs.

45:29.936 --> 45:31.801
But my drinking picked up

45:31.896 --> 45:35.809
and my wife did not care for
the company of my river friends.

45:35.900 --> 45:37.856
She decided to go back
to her first husband.

45:37.944 --> 45:40.686
He was a clerk in a hardware store.

45:42.031 --> 45:44.898
She said, "Goodbye, Reuben.

45:44.992 --> 45:47.825
"A love of decency
does not abide in you."

45:48.788 --> 45:51.495
There's your divorced woman
talking about decency.

45:51.791 --> 45:54.123
I told her, "Goodbye, Nola.

45:54.210 --> 45:57.953
"I hope that little nail-selling bastard
keeps you happy this time."

45:58.047 --> 45:59.912
She took my boy with her, too.

46:01.175 --> 46:03.837
He never cared for me anyway.

46:04.971 --> 46:07.678
I guess I did speak awful rough to him.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.931
I did not mean anything by it.

46:11.435 --> 46:14.518
You would not want to see
a clumsier child than Horace.

46:16.148 --> 46:18.184
I'll bet he broke 40 cups.

46:47.013 --> 46:48.423
Is it Chaney?

46:49.265 --> 46:51.631
I would not recognize
the soles of his feet.

46:52.059 --> 46:55.051
Well, you'll have to clamber up
and look.

46:56.063 --> 46:58.019
I'm too old and too fat.

46:58.274 --> 47:00.936
The Green Frog had one billiard table,

47:01.694 --> 47:05.437
served ladies and men both,
mostly men.

47:05.531 --> 47:09.570
I tried running it myself for a while
but couldn't keep good help.

47:09.994 --> 47:12.610
And I never did learn how to buy meat.

47:13.622 --> 47:15.078
Is that him?

47:15.624 --> 47:16.830
I believe not.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.574
Well, cut him down.

47:19.170 --> 47:21.582
- Why?
- I might know him.

47:25.259 --> 47:28.626
That was when I went out
to the Staked Plains of Texas,

47:28.929 --> 47:32.763
shooting buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe
and a Flathead Indian named Olly.

47:33.267 --> 47:37.385
The Mormons had run Shaftoe
out of Great Salt Lake City.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.016
Don't ask me what for.

47:39.106 --> 47:41.973
Call it a misunderstanding
and leave it go at that.

47:44.236 --> 47:48.605
Well, the big shaggies
is about all gone now.

47:48.741 --> 47:50.481
Damned shame.

47:51.202 --> 47:54.660
I'd give $3 right now
for a pickled buffalo tongue.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.706
Why did they hang him so high?

47:59.794 --> 48:01.534
I do not know.

48:02.296 --> 48:04.787
Possibly in the belief
it'd make him more dead.

48:19.438 --> 48:20.803
I do not know this man.

49:00.729 --> 49:03.562
Why is he taking the hanged man?
Did he know him?

49:04.150 --> 49:05.856
He did not.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.191
But it is a dead body.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.770
Possibly worth something in trade.

49:11.198 --> 49:13.280
Well, my second wife, Edna,

49:13.367 --> 49:16.029
she got the notion
she wanted me to be a lawyer.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.612
<i>Bought this heavy book called
Daniels on Negotiable Instruments</i>

49:19.707 --> 49:21.698
and set me to reading it.

49:22.501 --> 49:24.708
Never could get a grip on it.

49:24.795 --> 49:28.037
I was happy enough to set it aside
and leave Texas.

49:29.008 --> 49:31.294
There ain't six trees
between there and Canada,

49:31.385 --> 49:34.252
and nothing else grows
but has stickers on it.

49:34.388 --> 49:36.219
That's...

49:37.892 --> 49:39.428
I knew it.

49:39.518 --> 49:41.884
- Knew what?
- We're being followed.

49:42.855 --> 49:46.894
I asked that Indian to signal with a shot
if someone was on our trail.

49:48.444 --> 49:49.854
Should we be concerned, Marshal?

49:49.945 --> 49:54.063
No. It's Mr. LaBoeuf,
using us as bird dogs

49:54.158 --> 49:56.740
in hopes of cutting in
once we've flushed the prey.

49:57.703 --> 50:00.866
Well, perhaps we could double back
over our tracks,

50:00.956 --> 50:02.742
and confuse the trail in a clever way.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.449
No, we will wait right here,

50:06.754 --> 50:11.088
offer our friend a warm hello,
and ask him where he is going.

51:06.814 --> 51:08.600
You are not LaBoeuf.

51:09.984 --> 51:12.145
My name is Forster.

51:13.153 --> 51:16.771
I practice dentistry in the Nation.

51:17.074 --> 51:20.908
Also, veterinary arts and medicine

51:21.287 --> 51:24.620
on those humans that will sit still for it.

51:25.708 --> 51:27.619
You have your work cut out
for you there.

51:30.212 --> 51:35.206
Traded for him with an Indian,
who said he came by him honestly.

51:35.926 --> 51:40.886
I gave up two dental mirrors
and a bottle of expectorant.

51:43.392 --> 51:47.135
Do either of you need medical attention?

51:47.313 --> 51:48.348
No.

51:49.607 --> 51:52.019
It's fixing to get cold.

51:52.109 --> 51:53.974
Do you know of anywhere
to take shelter?

51:54.820 --> 51:56.856
I have my bearskin.

52:01.785 --> 52:05.573
You might want to head over
to the Original Greaser Bob's.

52:06.749 --> 52:11.618
He notched a dugout into a hollow
along the Carrillon River.

52:12.379 --> 52:17.123
If you ride the river,
you won't fail to see it.

52:17.718 --> 52:21.427
Greaser Bob, the Original Greaser Bob,

52:22.014 --> 52:25.381
is hunting north of the Picketwire

52:25.476 --> 52:28.468
and would not begrudge its use.

52:29.438 --> 52:32.771
- Much obliged.
- I have taken his teeth.

52:34.151 --> 52:38.485
I will entertain an offer
for the rest of him.

52:47.289 --> 52:49.075
Take my jack et.

52:50.125 --> 52:52.116
Creep up onto the roof.

52:53.587 --> 52:56.920
If they're unfriendly,
I'll give you a sign to damp the chimney.

53:21.740 --> 53:22.820
Who is out there?

53:23.784 --> 53:25.570
We're looking for shelter.

53:25.953 --> 53:28.035
No room for you here. Ride on.

53:30.958 --> 53:33.370
- Who all's in there?
- Ride on.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.784
I'm a Federal officer! Who's in there?

54:16.879 --> 54:19.370
A Methodist and a son of a bitch!

54:19.798 --> 54:21.709
This is Rooster Cogburn.

54:22.176 --> 54:25.794
Columbus Potter and five other
marshals is out here with me.

54:26.180 --> 54:28.216
We've got a buck et of coal oil.

54:28.307 --> 54:30.969
In one minute,
we will burn you out from both ends.

54:31.059 --> 54:32.799
There's only two of you.

54:32.895 --> 54:34.886
Go ahead and bet your life on it.

54:35.564 --> 54:36.804
How many of you's in there?

54:36.899 --> 54:40.391
Just the two of us,
but my partner's hit and he can't walk.

54:42.446 --> 54:43.856
Is that Emmett Quincy?

55:03.550 --> 55:07.042
You said it was a man on the roof.
I thought it was Potter.

55:07.262 --> 55:10.629
You was always dumb, Quincy,
and remain true to form.

55:11.141 --> 55:13.052
This here's an awful lot of sofky.

55:14.520 --> 55:16.260
You boys looking for company?

55:17.147 --> 55:21.060
That is our supper and breakfast both.
I like a big breakfast.

55:22.569 --> 55:26.027
Sofky always cooks up bigger
than you think.

55:26.114 --> 55:28.446
And a good store of whiskey here
as well.

55:29.117 --> 55:31.824
What are you boys up to,
outside of cooking banquets?

55:31.912 --> 55:33.243
We was just having our supper.

55:33.872 --> 55:36.454
We didn't know who was outside,
weather like this.

55:36.542 --> 55:39.909
It might have been some crazy man.
Anyone could say he is a marshal.

55:40.045 --> 55:41.251
My leg hurts.

55:41.672 --> 55:43.253
I'll bet it does.

55:48.262 --> 55:51.095
When was the last time
you seen your old pard Ned Pepper?

55:52.057 --> 55:54.264
I do not know him. Who is he?

55:54.601 --> 55:56.842
I'm surprised you don't remember him.

55:56.937 --> 56:00.600
He's a skinny fellow, nervous and quick.
His lip's all messed up.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.353
That don't bring anybody to mind.

56:03.443 --> 56:07.857
There is a new boy
that might be running with Ned.

56:08.448 --> 56:11.690
He's got a powder mark on his face,
a black place.

56:12.119 --> 56:15.611
He calls himself Chaney.
Or Chelmsford sometimes.

56:16.456 --> 56:18.287
Carries a Henry rifle.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.115
That don't bring anybody to mind.

56:20.335 --> 56:22.826
Black mark, I would remember that.

56:23.297 --> 56:26.539
You don't remember nothing
I want to know, do you, Quincy?

56:27.384 --> 56:28.965
What do you know, Moon?

56:29.052 --> 56:31.384
We don't know those boys
you're looking for.

56:31.471 --> 56:33.462
I don't know those boys.

56:34.474 --> 56:36.465
I always try to help out the law.

56:37.311 --> 56:39.267
By the time we get to Fort Smith,

56:39.354 --> 56:42.562
that leg will be swelled up
tight as Dick's hatband.

56:42.649 --> 56:45.812
It will be mortified and they will cut it off.

56:46.111 --> 56:48.227
And then if you live,
that'll get you two or three years

56:48.322 --> 56:50.187
in the Federal house
up in Detroit, there.

56:50.282 --> 56:51.317
You're trying to get at me.

56:51.408 --> 56:54.195
They'll teach you
how to read and write up there

56:54.828 --> 56:56.739
but the rest won't be so good.

56:56.830 --> 56:59.446
Them boys, they can be hard on a gimp.

56:59.541 --> 57:00.826
You are trying to get at me.

57:01.084 --> 57:04.542
Now, you give me
some good information on Ned,

57:04.963 --> 57:06.794
I'll take you down
to Bagby's store tomorrow

57:06.882 --> 57:08.838
and get that ball taken out of your leg.

57:09.009 --> 57:11.421
Then I'll give you three days
to clear the Territory.

57:11.511 --> 57:13.297
We don't know those boys
you're looking for.

57:15.474 --> 57:16.714
It ain't his leg.

57:16.808 --> 57:18.799
- I was...
- Don't go flapping your mouth, Moon.

57:18.894 --> 57:20.976
- It's best you'd let me do the talking.
- I was saying...

57:21.063 --> 57:23.099
We are weary trappers.

57:24.274 --> 57:26.014
Who worked you over
with the ugly stick?

57:26.401 --> 57:29.108
The man Chaney with the marked face
killed my father.

57:29.488 --> 57:31.979
He was a whiskey drinker like you
and it led to killing in the end.

57:33.825 --> 57:36.282
If you answer the marshal's questions,
he will help you.

57:36.370 --> 57:38.361
I have a good lawyer at home
and he will help you, too.

57:39.581 --> 57:42.744
I am puzzled by this. Why is she here?

57:43.251 --> 57:44.741
Don't you go jawing
with these people, Moon.

57:44.836 --> 57:46.246
Don't you go jawing with that runt.

57:46.338 --> 57:50.081
I don't like you. I hope you go to jail.
My lawyer will not help you.

57:50.217 --> 57:52.128
My leg is giving me fits.

57:52.260 --> 57:54.672
A young fellow like you
don't want to lose his leg.

57:55.138 --> 57:57.174
- We seen...
- He's trying to get at you.

57:57.265 --> 57:59.722
- With the truth.
- We seen Ned and Hayes two days ago.

57:59.810 --> 58:02.051
Don't you act the fool!
If you blow, I will kill you!

58:02.145 --> 58:05.558
I'm played out. I need a doctor!
We met Ned and Hayes two days ago.

58:21.039 --> 58:22.700
God damn it!

58:29.840 --> 58:32.957
Oh, Lord, I am dying.

58:35.512 --> 58:37.673
Do something. Help me.

58:38.140 --> 58:40.131
I can do nothing for you, son.

58:40.600 --> 58:42.807
Your pard has killed you
and I have done for him.

58:43.270 --> 58:45.261
Don't leave me lying here.

58:45.605 --> 58:47.596
Don't let the wolves rip me up.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.514
I'll see you're buried right.

58:49.609 --> 58:51.895
Tell me about Ned.
Where did you see him?

58:52.738 --> 58:55.070
Two days ago. Bagby's store.

58:56.408 --> 59:00.572
They are coming here tonight
to get remounts, and sofky.

59:01.413 --> 59:04.200
They just robbed the Katy Flyer
at Wagoner's Switch.

59:05.417 --> 59:06.702
I'm gone.

59:09.254 --> 59:12.337
Send the news to my brother,
George Garrett.

59:12.716 --> 59:16.174
He is a Methodist circuit rider
in South Texas.

59:16.928 --> 59:18.714
Shall I tell him you was outlawed up?

59:18.805 --> 59:21.797
It don't matter.
He knows I'm on the scout.

59:24.102 --> 59:27.390
I will meet him later,
walking the streets of glory.

59:28.940 --> 59:30.976
Well, don't be looking for Quincy.

59:43.622 --> 59:45.112
What do we do when they get here?

59:45.207 --> 59:48.699
They ride up. What we want
is to get them all in the dugout.

59:49.669 --> 59:52.786
I'll kill the last one that goes in,
then we'll have them in a barrel.

59:53.131 --> 59:54.792
You will shoot him in the back?

59:54.883 --> 59:57.340
It'll give them to know
our intentions are serious.

59:57.969 --> 1:00:01.928
Then I'll call down,
see if they'll be taken alive.

1:00:02.849 --> 1:00:06.012
If they won't,
I'll shoot them as they come out.

1:00:07.896 --> 1:00:09.727
I'm hopeful
that three of their party being dead

1:00:09.815 --> 1:00:11.555
will take the starch out of them.

1:00:13.985 --> 1:00:15.976
You display great poise.

1:00:18.490 --> 1:00:20.776
It's just a turkey shoot.

1:00:22.494 --> 1:00:28.581
There was one time, in New Mexico,
we was being pursued by seven men.

1:00:29.459 --> 1:00:31.916
I turned Bo around
and taking them reins in my teeth

1:00:32.003 --> 1:00:33.243
rode right at them boys,

1:00:33.338 --> 1:00:36.045
firing them two Navy sixes
I carry on my saddle.

1:00:37.134 --> 1:00:40.922
Well, I guess they was all married men
who loved their families

1:00:41.012 --> 1:00:42.968
as they scattered and run for home.

1:00:43.515 --> 1:00:45.972
- Well, that is hard to believe.
- What is?

1:00:46.184 --> 1:00:49.392
- One man riding at seven.
- It's true.

1:00:49.771 --> 1:00:51.932
You go for a man hard enough
and fast enough,

1:00:52.023 --> 1:00:54.480
he don't have time to think about
how many is with him.

1:00:54.568 --> 1:00:56.559
He thinks about hisself,

1:00:56.653 --> 1:01:00.020
how he might get clear of that wrath
that's about to set down on him.

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:02.025
Why were they pursuing you?

1:01:05.370 --> 1:01:06.951
I robbed a high-interest bank.

1:01:08.165 --> 1:01:10.156
You can't rob a thief, can you?

1:01:10.917 --> 1:01:13.624
Never robbed a citizen.
Never took a man's watch.

1:01:13.712 --> 1:01:15.373
It is all stealing.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:18.129
That's the position they took
in New Mexico.

1:01:30.228 --> 1:01:32.014
One man.

1:01:32.856 --> 1:01:35.097
I did not figure them to send a scout.

1:01:53.919 --> 1:01:55.284
Damn.

1:01:58.089 --> 1:01:59.329
Hello?

1:01:59.424 --> 1:02:01.665
It is LaBoeuf.

1:02:07.098 --> 1:02:08.679
We have to warn him, Marshal.

1:02:16.775 --> 1:02:18.766
Too late.

1:02:46.638 --> 1:02:47.969
Texas Ranger.

1:02:48.431 --> 1:02:49.796
What do we do, Marshal?

1:02:50.267 --> 1:02:52.428
We sit. What does he do?

1:03:11.913 --> 1:03:14.495
Him in the woolly chaps is Lucky Ned.

1:03:25.135 --> 1:03:26.841
Well, that's that.

1:04:20.065 --> 1:04:21.555
Well, that didn't pan out.

1:04:28.656 --> 1:04:31.568
You managed to put a kink
in my rope, pardner.

1:04:32.911 --> 1:04:36.244
- I'm severely injured.
- Yes, you got drug some.

1:04:36.748 --> 1:04:39.581
Also shot by a rifle.

1:04:39.667 --> 1:04:43.660
That's quite possible. The scheme
did not develop as I had planned.

1:04:45.006 --> 1:04:48.214
You've been shot in the shoulder,
but the bullet passed through.

1:04:48.301 --> 1:04:49.882
What happened to your mouth?

1:04:50.053 --> 1:04:52.465
I believe I bit myself.

1:04:52.555 --> 1:04:54.216
A couple of teeth loose and...

1:04:54.724 --> 1:04:58.262
Oh, yeah,
the tongue is bit almost through.

1:04:58.478 --> 1:05:01.470
Do you want to see if it will knit
or should I just yank it free?

1:05:01.606 --> 1:05:05.019
I know a teamster who bit his tongue off,
being thrown from a horse.

1:05:05.110 --> 1:05:07.852
After a time he learned to make himself
more or less understood.

1:05:07.946 --> 1:05:09.311
I'll just yank it free.

1:05:10.532 --> 1:05:12.022
What? What's that, now?

1:05:12.117 --> 1:05:13.903
- Knit.
- What's that now?

1:05:13.993 --> 1:05:15.824
Knit. It will knit.

1:05:16.121 --> 1:05:20.285
Very well.
It's impossible to bind a tongue wound.

1:05:20.750 --> 1:05:23.332
Too bad, we just run across
a doctor of sorts.

1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:24.705
- Marshal?
- But I do not know

1:05:24.796 --> 1:05:25.831
where he was headed.

1:05:25.922 --> 1:05:28.083
I saw him, too.
It's how I came to be here.

1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:30.756
Neither of these men are Chaney.

1:05:31.094 --> 1:05:32.925
I know, and I know them both.

1:05:33.847 --> 1:05:38.716
That ugly one is Coke Hayes.
Him uglier still is Clement Parmalee.

1:05:39.602 --> 1:05:42.890
Parmalee and his brothers have a silver
claim in the Winding Stair Mountains

1:05:42.981 --> 1:05:45.472
and I bet that's where
Lucky Ned's gang is waiting.

1:05:45.775 --> 1:05:48.767
We'll sleep here, follow in the morning.

1:05:48.862 --> 1:05:51.023
We promised to bury
the poor soul inside.

1:05:51.281 --> 1:05:53.021
Ground is too hard.

1:05:53.199 --> 1:05:54.860
If them men wanted a decent burial,

1:05:54.951 --> 1:05:57.442
they should have got themselves killed
in summer.

1:06:01.583 --> 1:06:03.699
Sleep well, Little Blackie.

1:06:03.793 --> 1:06:06.876
I have a notion that tomorrow
we will reach our object.

1:06:07.130 --> 1:06:09.212
We are hot on the trail.

1:06:09.299 --> 1:06:13.167
It seems that we will overtake Tom
Chaney in the Winding Stair Mountains.

1:06:13.261 --> 1:06:15.798
I would not want to be in his shoes.

1:06:24.898 --> 1:06:28.311
As I understand it, Chaney,
or Chelmsford,

1:06:28.401 --> 1:06:32.064
as he called himself in Texas,
shot the Senator's dog.

1:06:32.739 --> 1:06:36.231
When the Senator remonstrated,
Chelmsford shot him as well.

1:06:36.493 --> 1:06:38.984
Now, you could argue
that the shooting of the dog

1:06:39.078 --> 1:06:41.535
<i>was merely an instance
of malum prohibitum,</i>

1:06:41.623 --> 1:06:45.366
<i>but the shooting of a senator is
indubitably an instance of malum in se.</i>

1:06:45.752 --> 1:06:47.242
Malla-men what?

1:06:47.337 --> 1:06:48.998
<i>Malum in se.</i>

1:06:49.130 --> 1:06:52.247
The distinction is between an act
that is wrong in itself,

1:06:52.342 --> 1:06:56.460
and an act that is wrong only according
to our laws and mores. It is Latin.

1:06:58.223 --> 1:07:03.183
I'm struck that LaBoeuf
has been shot, trampled,

1:07:03.269 --> 1:07:05.260
and nearly severed his tongue

1:07:06.356 --> 1:07:10.690
and not only does he not cease to talk,
but he spills the banks of English.

1:07:15.406 --> 1:07:18.239
I was within 300 yards
of Chelmsford once.

1:07:19.869 --> 1:07:21.700
The closest I have been.

1:07:22.413 --> 1:07:24.745
With the Sharps carbine,
that is within range.

1:07:25.542 --> 1:07:26.952
But I was mounted,

1:07:27.043 --> 1:07:31.833
and had the choice of firing offhand,
or dismounting to shoot from rest,

1:07:31.965 --> 1:07:34.798
which would allow Chelmsford
to augment the distance.

1:07:36.511 --> 1:07:38.502
I fired mounted

1:07:40.056 --> 1:07:42.047
and fired wide.

1:07:46.062 --> 1:07:50.556
You could not hit a man at 300 yards
if your gun was resting on Gibraltar.

1:07:51.401 --> 1:07:54.814
The Sharps carbine is an instrument
of uncanny power and precision.

1:07:54.904 --> 1:07:57.896
I have no doubt that the gun is sound.

1:07:59.158 --> 1:08:01.149
<i>My clothes is all ragged</i>

1:08:01.244 --> 1:08:03.656
<i>My language is rough</i>

1:08:03.955 --> 1:08:07.994
<i>My bread is corn dodgers,
both solid and tough</i>

1:08:08.835 --> 1:08:12.999
<i>And yet I am happy,
and live at my ease</i>

1:08:13.089 --> 1:08:17.503
<i>On sorghum molasses,
and bacon and cheese</i>

1:08:18.052 --> 1:08:20.384
<i>Greer County Bachelor, that was.</i>

1:08:22.765 --> 1:08:24.471
I do not believe he slept.

1:08:32.900 --> 1:08:35.016
Fort Smith is a healthy distance,
LaBoeuf,

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:38.274
but I would encourage the creature
you ride to head thither.

1:08:38.865 --> 1:08:41.732
Out here, a one-armed man
looks like easy prey.

1:08:42.952 --> 1:08:46.945
And a one-eyed man who can't shoot?
Why don't you turn back, Cogburn?

1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:48.826
I'll do fine.

1:08:48.916 --> 1:08:51.453
I know where the Parmalee claim is.

1:08:51.544 --> 1:08:55.503
I am uninjured and well-provisioned
and we agreed to separate.

1:08:56.132 --> 1:08:58.589
In conscience,
you cannot cite our agreement.

1:08:58.676 --> 1:09:01.964
- You're the one who shot me.
- Mr. LaBoeuf has a point, Marshal.

1:09:02.263 --> 1:09:05.551
It is an unfair leg-up in any competition
to shoot your opposite number.

1:09:05.642 --> 1:09:09.134
God damn it! I do not accept it
as a given that I did shoot LaBoeuf.

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:10.889
There were plenty of guns going off.

1:09:10.980 --> 1:09:13.596
I heard the rifle and I felt the ball.

1:09:13.691 --> 1:09:15.227
You missed your shot, Cogburn,
admit it.

1:09:15.318 --> 1:09:16.603
Missed my shot?

1:09:16.694 --> 1:09:20.607
You are more handicapped
without the eye than I without the arm.

1:09:21.157 --> 1:09:23.944
I can hit a gnat's eye at 90 yards.

1:09:35.129 --> 1:09:37.791
That Chinaman is running them
cheap shells on me again.

1:09:37.882 --> 1:09:40.794
I thought you were gonna say
the sun was in your eyes.

1:09:41.135 --> 1:09:43.592
That is to say, your eye.

1:10:28.558 --> 1:10:30.389
Two at one time!

1:10:45.199 --> 1:10:47.861
I will chuck one high. Hold fire.

1:10:56.586 --> 1:10:58.577
- There.
- There?

1:10:59.088 --> 1:11:01.044
- My bullet.
- Your bullet?

1:11:01.132 --> 1:11:04.044
If you hit what you aim at,
explain my shoulder!

1:11:04.135 --> 1:11:05.841
Gentlemen, shooting cornbread
out here on the prairie

1:11:05.928 --> 1:11:07.759
is getting us no closer
to the Ned Pepper gang.

1:11:07.847 --> 1:11:10.463
One more. This will prove it.

1:11:10.558 --> 1:11:11.889
Please hold fire.

1:12:37.228 --> 1:12:39.219
Find our way back!

1:12:39.313 --> 1:12:41.770
Very few fiddle tunes I have not heard.

1:12:42.483 --> 1:12:45.065
Once heard,
they're locked into my mind forever.

1:12:54.245 --> 1:12:55.781
Lucky Ned?

1:13:06.674 --> 1:13:08.665
Lucky Ned!

1:13:10.845 --> 1:13:13.336
Very good, Cogburn. Now what?

1:13:19.937 --> 1:13:21.518
Oh, God damn it.

1:13:22.356 --> 1:13:24.813
Cogburn does not want me
eating out of his store.

1:13:25.234 --> 1:13:27.976
That is silly. You have not eaten all day,
and it is my store, not his.

1:13:28.070 --> 1:13:30.061
Let him starve!

1:13:31.657 --> 1:13:36.401
He does not track!
He does not shoot, except at foodstuffs!

1:13:36.495 --> 1:13:39.453
- That was your initiative.
- He does not contribute.

1:13:39.624 --> 1:13:43.287
He's a man
who walks in front of bullets!

1:13:43.377 --> 1:13:45.993
Mr. LaBoeuf drew single-handed upon
the Lucky Ned Pepper gang

1:13:46.088 --> 1:13:47.919
while we fired safely from cover.

1:13:48.007 --> 1:13:49.122
We?

1:13:49.216 --> 1:13:52.674
It is unfair to indict a man when his jaw
is swollen and tongue mangled

1:13:52.762 --> 1:13:54.878
and who is therefore unable
to rise to his own defense!

1:13:54.972 --> 1:13:56.963
I can speak for myself.

1:13:57.058 --> 1:14:00.516
I am hardly obliged to answer
the ravings of a drunkard.

1:14:00.603 --> 1:14:01.718
It is beneath me.

1:14:03.439 --> 1:14:05.646
I shall make my own camp elsewhere.

1:14:08.235 --> 1:14:11.147
It is you who have nothing
to offer, Cogburn.

1:14:11.238 --> 1:14:12.728
A sad picture indeed.

1:14:13.407 --> 1:14:16.365
This is no longer a manhunt.
It is a debauch.

1:14:17.244 --> 1:14:20.702
The Texas Ranger presses on alone.

1:14:23.584 --> 1:14:25.575
Take the girl. I bow out.

1:14:28.881 --> 1:14:30.496
A fine thing to decide
once you brought her

1:14:30.591 --> 1:14:32.172
into the middle of the Choctaw Nation.

1:14:32.259 --> 1:14:33.920
I bow out! I wash my hands!

1:14:34.011 --> 1:14:35.967
Gentlemen,
we cannot fall out in this fashion.

1:14:36.347 --> 1:14:38.838
Not so close to our goal,
with Tom Chaney nearly in hand.

1:14:38.933 --> 1:14:39.968
In hand?

1:14:41.519 --> 1:14:43.430
If he is not in a shallow grave

1:14:43.521 --> 1:14:46.729
somewhere between here
and Fort Smith, he is gone!

1:14:47.566 --> 1:14:48.726
Long gone!

1:14:49.276 --> 1:14:52.234
Thanks to Mr. LaBoeuf,
we missed our shot.

1:14:52.613 --> 1:14:55.275
We've barked, and the birds have flown!

1:14:55.366 --> 1:14:56.981
Gone, gone, gone!

1:14:57.451 --> 1:14:59.737
Lucky Ned and his cohort gone.

1:14:59.829 --> 1:15:01.490
Your $50 gone!

1:15:01.580 --> 1:15:04.538
Gone the whiskey, seized in evidence!

1:15:05.626 --> 1:15:08.459
The trail is cold, if there ever was one.

1:15:10.965 --> 1:15:12.375
I'm...

1:15:12.466 --> 1:15:17.301
I'm a foolish old man who has
been drawn into a wild-goose chase

1:15:17.763 --> 1:15:21.551
by a harpy in trousers
and a nincompoop!

1:15:22.435 --> 1:15:28.055
Well, Mr. LaBoeuf, he can wander the
Choctaw Nation for as long as he likes.

1:15:28.149 --> 1:15:31.061
Perhaps the local Indians
will take him in

1:15:31.152 --> 1:15:33.814
and honor his gibberings
by making him chief!

1:15:35.239 --> 1:15:37.525
You, sister, may go where you like.

1:15:38.492 --> 1:15:40.528
Our engagement is terminated.

1:15:42.997 --> 1:15:44.487
I bow out.

1:15:52.465 --> 1:15:55.502
- I am going with you.
- That is not possible.

1:15:56.052 --> 1:15:57.838
Have I held you back?

1:15:58.679 --> 1:16:01.591
I have a Colt's Dragoon revolver
which I know how to use,

1:16:01.682 --> 1:16:04.094
and I will be no more of a burden to you
than I was to the marshal.

1:16:04.185 --> 1:16:08.895
That is not my worry. You've earned
your spurs. That is clear enough.

1:16:09.774 --> 1:16:12.607
You've been a regular old hand
on the trail.

1:16:14.111 --> 1:16:15.442
But Cogburn is right,

1:16:15.529 --> 1:16:18.612
even if I would not give him
the satisfaction of conceding it.

1:16:20.367 --> 1:16:22.198
The trail is cold

1:16:23.454 --> 1:16:27.413
and I am considerably diminished.

1:16:28.084 --> 1:16:29.164
How can you give up now

1:16:29.251 --> 1:16:31.242
after the many months
you've dedicated to finding Chaney?

1:16:32.588 --> 1:16:34.874
You have shown great determination.

1:16:36.133 --> 1:16:38.044
I misjudged you.

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:43.588
I picked the wrong man.

1:16:46.894 --> 1:16:50.728
I would go on in your company
if there were a clear way to go.

1:16:52.316 --> 1:16:54.307
But we'd be striking out blindly.

1:16:55.986 --> 1:16:57.442
Chelmsford's gone.

1:16:58.906 --> 1:17:00.897
We chased him right off the map.

1:17:02.409 --> 1:17:04.320
There's nothing for it.

1:17:08.207 --> 1:17:10.118
I'm bound for Texas.

1:17:11.293 --> 1:17:12.578
Time for you to go home, too.

1:17:14.046 --> 1:17:15.707
The marshal, when he sobers,

1:17:17.842 --> 1:17:18.922
is your way back.

1:17:19.218 --> 1:17:22.051
I will not go back.
Not without Chaney, dead or alive.

1:17:25.683 --> 1:17:27.674
I misjudged you as well.

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:32.261
I extend my hand.

1:17:32.773 --> 1:17:34.764
Mr. LaBoeuf, please.

1:19:37.106 --> 1:19:38.266
I know you.

1:19:41.860 --> 1:19:45.444
Your name is Mattie.
You're little Mattie the bookkeeper.

1:19:47.408 --> 1:19:48.614
Isn't that something?

1:19:48.701 --> 1:19:50.692
Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney.

1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:56.196
- What are you doing out here?
- Come to fetch some water.

1:19:56.625 --> 1:19:58.707
I mean, what are you doing
in these mountains here?

1:19:58.794 --> 1:20:00.455
I have not been formally deputized

1:20:00.546 --> 1:20:02.537
but I'm acting as an agent
for Marshal Reuben Cogburn

1:20:02.631 --> 1:20:03.996
and Judge Parker's court.

1:20:10.139 --> 1:20:12.551
I have come to take you back
to Fort Smith.

1:20:18.230 --> 1:20:20.562
Well, I will not go. How do you like that?

1:20:21.442 --> 1:20:23.774
There is a posse of officers up there
who will force you to go.

1:20:24.403 --> 1:20:27.236
That is interesting news.
How many is up there?

1:20:27.906 --> 1:20:31.398
Right around 50. And they're all
well-armed and they mean business.

1:20:32.077 --> 1:20:33.817
What I want you to do now
is come on across the creek

1:20:33.912 --> 1:20:35.743
and walk in front of me up that hill.

1:20:36.415 --> 1:20:39.703
I think I will oblige the officers
to come after me.

1:20:40.252 --> 1:20:42.413
Well, if you refuse to go,
I will have to shoot you.

1:20:44.381 --> 1:20:46.918
Well, then, you had better
cock your piece.

1:20:48.594 --> 1:20:50.255
All the way back.

1:20:51.013 --> 1:20:53.129
- Till it locks.
- I know how to do it.

1:20:54.016 --> 1:20:56.723
- You will not go with me?
- No, it's just the other way around.

1:20:56.810 --> 1:20:58.266
You're going with me.

1:21:08.906 --> 1:21:12.114
- I did not think you would do it.
- Well, what do you think now?

1:21:12.284 --> 1:21:14.024
One of my short ribs is broken.

1:21:14.119 --> 1:21:17.031
You killed my father
when he was trying to help you.

1:21:17.122 --> 1:21:19.829
I have one of the gold pieces you stole
from him. Now give me the other.

1:21:19.917 --> 1:21:21.532
- Nothing's gone right for me.
- Mattie!

1:21:21.627 --> 1:21:24.209
- I'm down here.
- Now I'm shot by a child.

1:21:24.296 --> 1:21:25.911
Chaney is taken into custody.

1:21:32.471 --> 1:21:34.211
- Help me!
- Mattie!

1:21:37.309 --> 1:21:38.424
Marshal!

1:21:44.817 --> 1:21:46.648
Take them horses you got and move!

1:21:52.491 --> 1:21:54.982
Tom, you get on up that hill.
Don't you stop.

1:21:58.831 --> 1:22:01.948
- Who all's down there?
- Marshal Cogburn and 50 more officers.

1:22:08.507 --> 1:22:10.919
You tell me another lie
and I'll stove your head in.

1:22:11.635 --> 1:22:12.715
Just the marshal.

1:22:14.555 --> 1:22:15.965
Rooster.

1:22:18.016 --> 1:22:21.008
Cogburn! You hear me?

1:22:24.314 --> 1:22:26.305
You answer me, Rooster!

1:22:27.151 --> 1:22:30.063
I will kill this girl. You know I will do it.

1:22:31.864 --> 1:22:35.152
The girl is nothing to me!
She's a runaway from Arkansas!

1:22:35.576 --> 1:22:39.319
That is all very well.
Do you advise that I kill her?

1:22:42.207 --> 1:22:46.917
Do what you think is best, Ned!
She's nothing to me but a lost child.

1:22:49.047 --> 1:22:50.628
Think it over first.

1:22:51.300 --> 1:22:53.632
I have already thought it over.

1:22:53.719 --> 1:22:55.550
You get mounted double fast!

1:22:55.637 --> 1:23:00.427
If I see you riding over that bald ridge
to the northwest, I will spare the girl.

1:23:01.268 --> 1:23:02.383
You have five minutes!

1:23:02.478 --> 1:23:05.470
There will be a party of marshals
here soon, Ned!

1:23:05.564 --> 1:23:09.728
Let me have the girl and Chaney,
and I will mislead them for six hours.

1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:13.022
Too thin, Rooster. Too thin!

1:23:13.697 --> 1:23:16.530
Your five minutes is running!
No more talk.

1:23:20.412 --> 1:23:21.652
Get on up that hill!

1:23:24.708 --> 1:23:25.743
Quiet there.

1:23:33.133 --> 1:23:37.467
- Farrell, see to Tom's wound.
- Can I have some of that bacon?

1:23:37.638 --> 1:23:40.380
You help yourself.
Have some of the coffee.

1:23:40.641 --> 1:23:42.882
I do not drink coffee. I'm 14.

1:23:43.852 --> 1:23:46.810
Well, we do not have buttermilk
and we do not have bread.

1:23:47.147 --> 1:23:49.308
- We are poorly supplied.
- Where is she?

1:23:49.399 --> 1:23:51.856
- What are you doing here?
- I ought to wring your scrawny neck.

1:23:51.944 --> 1:23:53.309
You let that go.

1:23:55.489 --> 1:23:56.695
What happened, huh?

1:23:56.907 --> 1:23:58.898
I will tell you and you will see
that I am in the right.

1:23:59.451 --> 1:24:01.567
Tom Chaney there
shot my father to death in Fort Smith,

1:24:01.662 --> 1:24:04.119
and robbed him of two gold pieces
and stole his mare.

1:24:04.456 --> 1:24:07.368
I was informed Rooster Cogburn had
grit and I hired him to find the murderer.

1:24:08.126 --> 1:24:10.287
A few minutes ago, I came upon
Chaney watering the horses.

1:24:10.420 --> 1:24:12.911
He would not be taken in charge
and I shot him.

1:24:13.090 --> 1:24:16.127
If I had killed him, I would not be
now in this fix. My revolver misfired.

1:24:17.803 --> 1:24:21.295
It will do it.
It will embarrass you every time.

1:24:22.391 --> 1:24:24.882
Most girls like to play pretties,
but you like guns, do you?

1:24:25.143 --> 1:24:26.758
I do not care a thing in the world
about guns.

1:24:26.853 --> 1:24:28.059
If I did, I would have one that worked.

1:24:28.146 --> 1:24:29.852
I was shot from ambush, Ned.

1:24:29.982 --> 1:24:33.270
My horses was blowing
and making noise. That officer got me.

1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:35.521
How can you sit there
and tell such a big story?

1:24:35.904 --> 1:24:38.316
That pit is 100 feet deep
and I will throw you in it.

1:24:38.574 --> 1:24:41.486
I'll leave you to scream and rot!
How do you like that?

1:24:41.577 --> 1:24:43.488
No, you won't.
This man will not let you have your way.

1:24:43.579 --> 1:24:46.070
He is your boss
and you have to do as he tells you.

1:24:46.164 --> 1:24:48.496
Well, nothing's going my way.

1:24:49.084 --> 1:24:51.166
Was that Rooster waylaid us
night before last?

1:24:51.503 --> 1:24:52.913
It was Marshal Cogburn and myself.

1:24:53.505 --> 1:24:56.838
You and Cogburn. Quite the posse.

1:25:15.402 --> 1:25:18.314
- Let us move, Ned.
- In good time, Doctor.

1:25:18.405 --> 1:25:19.895
What happened to Quincy and The Kid?

1:25:22.409 --> 1:25:24.070
They are both dead.

1:25:25.037 --> 1:25:27.744
I was in the very middle of it.
It was a terrible thing to see.

1:25:27.873 --> 1:25:30.865
Please, let us move, Ned.
The marshal's gone.

1:25:31.418 --> 1:25:34.581
- Do you need a good lawyer?
- I need a good judge.

1:25:35.714 --> 1:25:38.877
What happened to Coke Hayes,
the old fellow shot off his horse?

1:25:39.134 --> 1:25:43.218
Dead as well.
His depredations have come to an end.

1:25:43.805 --> 1:25:46.296
Your friend Rooster
does not collect many prisoners.

1:25:46.391 --> 1:25:48.302
He is not my friend.

1:25:50.145 --> 1:25:52.227
He's abandoned me
to a congress of louts.

1:25:52.731 --> 1:25:54.972
You do not varnish your opinion.

1:25:55.442 --> 1:25:56.522
Are we off?

1:25:56.610 --> 1:25:59.067
Let us cut up the winnings
from the Katy Flyer.

1:25:59.237 --> 1:26:01.068
There'll be time for that
at The Old Place.

1:26:01.156 --> 1:26:03.898
- I will mount the bay.
- I have other plans for you.

1:26:03.992 --> 1:26:06.358
- Must I double-mount with the doctor?
- No.

1:26:06.453 --> 1:26:09.286
No, too chancy with two men up
if it comes to a race.

1:26:09.956 --> 1:26:11.571
Tom, you wait here with the girl.

1:26:11.917 --> 1:26:14.579
When we reach Ma's house,
I'll send Carroll back with a fresh mount.

1:26:14.961 --> 1:26:18.294
You will be out by dark,
and we will meet you at The Old Place.

1:26:18.423 --> 1:26:19.629
I do not like that.

1:26:20.008 --> 1:26:22.966
Let me ride with you, Ned,
just out of here anyway.

1:26:23.095 --> 1:26:25.632
- We're short a horse.
- Marshals will come swarming.

1:26:25.764 --> 1:26:28.972
Hours, if they come here at all.
They'll think that we've all gone.

1:26:29.101 --> 1:26:31.683
I am not staying here by myself
with Tom Chaney.

1:26:31.937 --> 1:26:34.269
- That's the way I will have it.
- He will kill me.

1:26:34.773 --> 1:26:36.309
You heard him say it.
He's killed my father

1:26:36.441 --> 1:26:37.851
and now you will let him kill me.

1:26:37.943 --> 1:26:39.649
He will do no such thing.

1:26:39.778 --> 1:26:43.771
Tom, you know the crossing at Cypress
Forks, near the log meeting house?

1:26:44.491 --> 1:26:47.153
When you are mounted,
you take the girl and leave her there.

1:26:47.285 --> 1:26:48.866
Do you understand, Tom?

1:26:48.954 --> 1:26:52.617
Any harm comes to that child,
you do not get paid.

1:26:55.127 --> 1:26:57.960
Harold, let me ride up with you.

1:26:58.964 --> 1:26:59.953
Farrell!

1:27:00.048 --> 1:27:03.632
I will pay you $50 out of my winnings.
I am not heavy.

1:27:04.219 --> 1:27:07.131
Do the calf again, Harold!

1:27:33.498 --> 1:27:35.659
Everything is against me.

1:27:36.001 --> 1:27:37.992
You have no reason to whine.

1:27:38.670 --> 1:27:41.252
If you act as the bandit chief instructed,
and no harm comes to me,

1:27:41.339 --> 1:27:43.204
you will get your winnings
at The Old Place.

1:27:43.341 --> 1:27:46.833
Lucky Ned has left me, knowing I am
sure to be caught when I leave on foot.

1:27:47.929 --> 1:27:51.092
I must think over my position
and how I may improve it.

1:27:51.683 --> 1:27:53.344
Where is the second
California gold piece?

1:27:56.354 --> 1:27:58.686
- What have you done with Papa's mare?
- Keep still.

1:27:59.900 --> 1:28:01.356
Are you thinking about The Old Place?

1:28:01.860 --> 1:28:05.102
Look here, if you let me go,
I will swear to it in an affidavit

1:28:05.197 --> 1:28:07.563
and once you are brought to justice
it may go easier on you.

1:28:10.869 --> 1:28:13.030
I tell you, I can do better than that.

1:28:19.211 --> 1:28:21.042
I need no affidavit.

1:28:26.885 --> 1:28:28.591
All I need is your silence.

1:28:33.475 --> 1:28:35.887
Your father was a busybody like you.

1:28:36.061 --> 1:28:40.555
In honesty, I do not regret shooting him.
He thought Tom Chaney was small.

1:28:41.399 --> 1:28:46.063
And you, you would give me an affidavit.
You're all against me. Every...

1:28:52.786 --> 1:28:54.071
So that is Chelmsford.

1:28:55.956 --> 1:28:58.072
Strange to be so close to him at last.

1:28:58.625 --> 1:29:01.332
Mr. LaBoeuf.
How is it that you are here?

1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:04.912
I heard a shot
and went down to the river.

1:29:05.757 --> 1:29:09.841
Cogburn outlined a plan.
Mind your footing, there's a pit there.

1:29:10.929 --> 1:29:13.762
His part, I fear, is rash.

1:29:16.268 --> 1:29:18.600
He returns for Lucky Ned.

1:29:35.620 --> 1:29:39.033
Well, Rooster, will you give us the road?

1:29:40.208 --> 1:29:42.039
One against four? It is ill-advised.

1:29:42.627 --> 1:29:44.037
He would not be dissuaded.

1:29:44.212 --> 1:29:45.292
Hello, Ned.

1:29:45.547 --> 1:29:47.538
How many men is with the girl?

1:29:47.632 --> 1:29:50.465
Just Chaney. Our agreement is in force.

1:29:51.511 --> 1:29:53.968
She was in excellent health
when last I saw her.

1:29:55.390 --> 1:29:58.848
Farrell, I want you and your brother
to stand clear.

1:29:59.811 --> 1:30:03.850
You as well, Doctor.
I have no interest in you today.

1:30:05.066 --> 1:30:09.480
What is your intention, Rooster?
You think one on four is a dogfall?

1:30:10.238 --> 1:30:12.650
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.

1:30:13.158 --> 1:30:17.401
Or see you hanged in Fort Smith
at Judge Parker's convenience.

1:30:18.330 --> 1:30:19.991
Which will you have?

1:30:20.707 --> 1:30:24.370
I call that bold talk
for a one-eyed fat man!

1:30:29.215 --> 1:30:31.376
Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!

1:30:47.067 --> 1:30:50.525
- Shoot them, Mr. LaBoeuf.
- Too far. Moving too fast.

1:31:32.487 --> 1:31:33.727
Well, Rooster,

1:31:35.448 --> 1:31:37.234
I am shot to pieces.

1:31:38.743 --> 1:31:42.486
It seems neither of us
is to see Judge Parker.

1:31:51.464 --> 1:31:52.749
Oh, Lord.

1:32:06.104 --> 1:32:09.847
Some bully shot!
That was 400 yards, at least.

1:32:10.942 --> 1:32:14.605
Well, the Sharps carbine is a...

1:32:29.627 --> 1:32:31.367
Stand up, Tom Chaney.

1:33:09.250 --> 1:33:11.036
Mr. LaBoeuf.

1:33:14.839 --> 1:33:16.045
Are you alive?

1:34:29.164 --> 1:34:31.120
Mr. LaBoeuf!

1:34:35.670 --> 1:34:37.501
Mr. LaBoeuf!

1:34:39.090 --> 1:34:40.500
Mr. LaBoeuf!

1:34:43.761 --> 1:34:45.342
Are you there?

1:34:45.930 --> 1:34:48.387
- I'm here!
- Can you clamber out?

1:34:48.474 --> 1:34:49.759
I cannot.

1:34:50.018 --> 1:34:52.179
- There are snakes.
- They awake?

1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:53.680
Yes.

1:35:07.035 --> 1:35:08.275
I am bit!

1:35:18.463 --> 1:35:20.954
- Does Mr. LaBoeuf survive?
- He does.

1:35:21.132 --> 1:35:24.465
Even a blow to the head could silence
him for only a few short minutes.

1:35:24.552 --> 1:35:26.292
Where are you bit?

1:35:31.476 --> 1:35:32.682
Look away now.

1:35:59.587 --> 1:36:01.919
I have her. Up with us!

1:36:09.180 --> 1:36:11.045
We're up, Mr. LaBoeuf. Take her.

1:36:12.934 --> 1:36:14.595
She's snakebit.

1:36:17.021 --> 1:36:20.354
We're off.
I'll send help for you as soon as I can.

1:36:20.858 --> 1:36:21.938
Don't wander off.

1:36:23.027 --> 1:36:24.892
We are not leaving him.

1:36:25.196 --> 1:36:27.938
I must get you to a doc, sis,
or you're not gonna make it.

1:36:28.783 --> 1:36:30.398
I'm in your debt for that shot, pard.

1:36:30.618 --> 1:36:32.279
Never doubt the Texas Ranger.

1:36:32.704 --> 1:36:34.035
Go on!

1:36:35.456 --> 1:36:36.696
Ever stalwart.

1:37:39.729 --> 1:37:42.812
We must stop.
Little Blackie is played out.

1:37:43.775 --> 1:37:45.390
We have miles yet.

1:37:46.819 --> 1:37:48.275
Come on, you!

1:37:48.905 --> 1:37:49.940
No!

1:37:52.450 --> 1:37:54.441
That's it. Come on, now!

1:37:55.078 --> 1:37:56.739
No, stop!

1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:19.010
He's getting away.

1:38:19.268 --> 1:38:21.133
Who's getting away, sis?

1:38:22.105 --> 1:38:23.470
Chaney.

1:38:58.474 --> 1:39:00.214
No. No!

1:39:00.351 --> 1:39:02.012
No, no, no!

1:39:03.688 --> 1:39:05.303
No, no!

1:39:10.820 --> 1:39:12.151
No!

1:40:39.450 --> 1:40:41.156
I've grown old.

1:41:03.015 --> 1:41:05.301
<i>A quarter century is a long time.</i>

1:41:20.658 --> 1:41:24.367
<i>By the time we reached Bagby's store,
my hand had turned black.</i>

1:41:25.162 --> 1:41:27.699
<i>I was not awake when I lost the arm.</i>

1:41:30.793 --> 1:41:34.752
<i>The marshal had stayed with me,
I was told, till I was out of danger.</i>

1:41:34.839 --> 1:41:37.376
<i>But he departed before I came round.</i>

1:41:37.883 --> 1:41:40.920
<i>Once home, I wrote him
with an invitation to come by</i>

1:41:41.012 --> 1:41:43.879
<i>the next time he found himself
near Yell County</i>

1:41:44.015 --> 1:41:46.631
<i>and collect the $50 I still owed him.</i>

1:41:47.643 --> 1:41:51.227
<i>I did not hear back from Marshal
Cogburn and he did not appear.</i>

1:41:53.482 --> 1:41:57.350
<i>Then one day I received a note from
the marshal with a flyer enclosed.</i>

1:41:59.363 --> 1:42:02.105
<i>He said he was traveling
with a Wild West show,</i>

1:42:02.241 --> 1:42:04.653
<i>getting older and fatter.</i>

1:42:04.744 --> 1:42:07.201
<i>Would I like to come visit him
when the show came to Memphis</i>

1:42:07.330 --> 1:42:09.696
<i>and swap stories with an old trail mate?</i>

1:42:11.083 --> 1:42:14.246
<i>He would understand
if the journey were too long.</i>

1:42:17.506 --> 1:42:19.713
<i>Brief though his note was,</i>

1:42:20.217 --> 1:42:22.208
<i>it was rife with misspellings.</i>

1:42:23.387 --> 1:42:24.843
Yessum?

1:42:24.930 --> 1:42:26.670
I am Cole Younger.

1:42:27.058 --> 1:42:29.049
This is Mr. James.

1:42:30.186 --> 1:42:33.053
It grieves me to tell you
that you have missed Rooster.

1:42:34.231 --> 1:42:36.187
He passed away three days ago

1:42:36.275 --> 1:42:38.732
when the Show was in Jonesboro,
Arkansas.

1:42:39.403 --> 1:42:42.065
Buried him there
in the Confederate cemetery.

1:42:43.616 --> 1:42:47.359
Reuben had a complaint
what he referred to as "night hoss"

1:42:47.620 --> 1:42:50.612
and I believe the warm weather
was too much for him.

1:42:52.458 --> 1:42:54.699
We had some lively times.

1:42:56.379 --> 1:42:58.791
What was the nature
of your acquaintance?

1:43:00.383 --> 1:43:02.374
I knew the marshal long ago.

1:43:02.968 --> 1:43:05.801
We too had lively times.

1:43:08.140 --> 1:43:09.255
Thank you, Mr. Younger.

1:43:12.228 --> 1:43:13.559
Keep your seat, trash.

1:43:15.940 --> 1:43:19.808
<i>I had the body removed to our plot
and I have visited it over the years.</i>

1:43:24.907 --> 1:43:27.398
<i>No doubt people talk about that.</i>

1:43:27.493 --> 1:43:30.530
<i>They say,
"Well, she hardly knew the man.</i>

1:43:30.621 --> 1:43:32.828
<i>"Isn't she a cranky old maid?"</i>

1:43:33.958 --> 1:43:36.165
<i>It is true, I have not married.</i>

1:43:36.293 --> 1:43:38.124
<i>I never had time to fool with it.</i>

1:43:41.507 --> 1:43:44.749
<i>I heard nothing more
of the Tex as officer LaBoeuf.</i>

1:43:44.969 --> 1:43:47.802
<i>If he is yet alive,
I would be pleased to hear from him.</i>

1:43:48.764 --> 1:43:50.720
<i>I judge he would be in his 70s now,</i>

1:43:50.808 --> 1:43:52.673
<i>and nearer 80 than 70.</i>

1:43:53.811 --> 1:43:56.678
<i>I expect some of the starch
has gone out of that cowlick.</i>

1:43:58.983 --> 1:44:01.144
<i>Time just gets away from us.</i>

1:44:10.145 --> 1:45:02.145
