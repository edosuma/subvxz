WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:03.371
(Mindy)
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING

00:03.404 --> 00:05.273
THAT, IN THE MOST ROMANTIC CITY
IN THE WORLD,

00:05.306 --> 00:06.240
I JUST HAPPENED
TO HAVE FOUND

00:06.274 --> 00:09.077
THE MOST ROMANTIC BOYFRIEND
IN THE WORLD,

00:09.110 --> 00:10.578
AND EVERY DATE
IS FULL OF SURPRISES.

00:10.611 --> 00:13.114
DANNY, HOW CAN SOMETHING
AS DISGUSTING AS AN APPLE

00:13.147 --> 00:15.249
MAKE SOMETHING AS DELICIOUS
AS APPLE PIE?

00:15.283 --> 00:17.485
MINDY, I HAVE SOMETHING
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ASK YOU.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.821
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME MORE APPLE PIE?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.223
[gasps]

00:22.256 --> 00:23.557
THAT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN WHAT I THOUGHT

00:23.591 --> 00:24.625
YOU WERE GONNA ASK.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.394
COME HERE.
I KNEW YOU'D LIKE IT.

00:28.429 --> 00:29.697
HEY.
HEY.

00:32.233 --> 00:35.136
OH, MY GOD.
DANNY.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.271
I LOVE IT.
YEAH?

00:37.305 --> 00:40.174
DID YOU ALSO HAPPEN TO REMEMBER
MY NOSE HAIR TRIMMER?

00:42.443 --> 00:43.411
LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.846
I'LL BE OUT IN 20.
OKAY.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.415
[trimmer buzzes]

00:47.448 --> 00:49.083
(Mindy)
BUT PERHAPS MOST SURPRISING,

00:49.117 --> 00:52.253
NOT ALL SURPRISES
ARE EQUALLY ROMANTIC.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.355
OH, MY GOD,
DANNY, THIS IS HEAVEN.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.257
[both moaning]

00:56.290 --> 00:57.825
WAIT.
DANNY.

00:57.858 --> 00:58.826
DANNY, THAT
DOESN'T GO THERE.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.329
OH, MY GOD,
DANNY!

01:01.362 --> 01:02.863
I SLIPPED.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.866
[upbeat music]

01:05.899 --> 01:14.108
*

01:17.845 --> 01:19.680
WHY IS IT SO HARD
TO BELIEVE ME?

01:19.713 --> 01:21.449
BECAUSE SLIPPING IS LIKE,
"WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.184
WHAT HAPPENED?"
NOT "WHOA, WHOA, OH, YEAH."

01:23.217 --> 01:24.352
OKAY, YOU'RE
TWISTING MY SOUNDS.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.387
BESIDES, YOU WEREN'T
WHERE I WAS, OKAY?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.222
YOU DIDN'T SEE
HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.523
DANNY, THIS IS
NOT BENGHAZI.

01:29.557 --> 01:30.591
WELL, SURE
FEELS LIKE IT.

01:30.624 --> 01:31.592
NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SYMPATHIZE

01:31.625 --> 01:34.295
WITH HILLARY
ABOUT ANYTHING.
WHO IS HILLARY?

01:34.328 --> 01:36.197
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
JUST MAKING THESE PEOPLE UP.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.666
OKAY, SO YOU'RE INNOCENT?
YOU HAD NO INTENT?

01:38.699 --> 01:40.901
OF COURSE NO INTENT.
I'M CATHOLIC.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.303
EVEN IF I THINK
ABOUT THAT--

01:42.336 --> 01:44.138
THEY PROMOTE YOU
TO CARDINAL?
HEY, HEY.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.339
THAT IS ALL OVER.
IT'S OVER.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.474
POPE FRANK
IS ON THE CASE.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.376
HE--

01:48.409 --> 01:51.912
MORGAN, WE'RE JUST IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.415
OKAY, THEN THESE COBWEBS
CAN JUST CLEAN THEMSELVES.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.749
GET OUT OF HERE.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.785
WE'RE HAVING
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.
THANK YOU.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.753
CAN WE PLEASE JUST GO
TALK ABOUT THIS IN YOUR OFFICE?

01:59.787 --> 02:01.155
PLEASE?
I DON'T KNOW, DANNY.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.790
BECAUSE MY OFFICE
ONLY HAS ONE ENTRANCE,

02:02.823 --> 02:04.692
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR YOU ANYMORE.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.727
WHAT?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.397
I WAS JUST WALKING
TO THE SUBWAY,

02:09.430 --> 02:11.399
AND THIS SCOUT WAS LIKE,
"GIRL, YOU SHOULD MODEL."

02:11.432 --> 02:12.700
I'M LIKE, "I ALREADY
HAVE A JOB."

02:12.733 --> 02:14.535
THAT'S SO WEIRD.
THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.404
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

02:16.437 --> 02:18.272
DR. REED, IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SIT OVER HERE

02:18.306 --> 02:20.874
AND EAT BREAKFAST WITH US
AND SHARE OUR WEEKEND STORIES,

02:20.908 --> 02:22.042
YOU GOT
ANOTHER THING COMING.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.512
YOU'RE NOT STILL MAD AT ME
FOR DATING LAUREN, ARE YOU?

02:24.545 --> 02:26.180
YOU MEAN
STEALING LAUREN?

02:26.214 --> 02:28.349
SORRY, I'M #TEAMPETER.
UH-HUH.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.418
THE WHOLE OFFICE
IS #TEAMPETER,

02:30.451 --> 02:31.452
AND WE GOT MERCH.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.654
WE GOT A WEBSITE.
WE HAVE A MASCOT.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.190
I'M GLAD TO SEE
#TEAMPETER'S ASSEMBLED.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.325
I AM FURIOUS.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.328
LAST NIGHT, I GRADUATED
FROM NURSE PRACTITIONER SCHOOL.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.562
NONE OF YOU CAME.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.264
IT WAS SAD
AS HELL.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.698
MORGAN BOUGHT
AN EXTRA WHEEL OF BRIE

02:44.732 --> 02:46.400
JUST FOR YOU, DR. L.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.602
AW, THAT'S SO NICE.
IT REALLY
SET ME BACK.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.904
CAN I STILL HAVE IT?
ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS THE CRUST.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.306
PUT IT IN MY OFFICE.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.374
MORGAN, I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T GO.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.410
IT'S JUST THAT DANNY AND I
HAD A DATE LAST NIGHT.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.578
YOU'VE CHANGED.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.813
YOU ALWAYS PROMISED ME YOU'D
NEVER BE ONE OF THOSE GIRLS

02:59.847 --> 03:01.849
WHO DITCHES THEIR BEST FRIEND
THE MINUTE THEY GET A BOYFRIEND.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.251
I WOULD NEVER PROMISE THAT.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.184
ALL I'VE WANTED IN MY LIFE IS

03:04.218 --> 03:05.819
TO ABANDON ALL MY FRIENDS
FOR A BOYFRIEND.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.589
CALM DOWN.
MORGAN, I'M SORRY
THAT I COULD NOT ATTEND.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.758
BUT IN MY DEFENSE, I THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS GONNA BE THERE.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.759
WELL, I DIDN'T COME
'CAUSE I THOUGHT

03:11.792 --> 03:12.760
HE WAS GONNA BE THERE.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.328
ME TOO.
THAT'S MY EXCUSE TOO.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.929
I'M REALLY CAUGHT UP
IN THEIR BEEF.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.431
YOU JUST SAID IT WAS
'CAUSE OF YOUR BOYFRIEND.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.400
NO, IT'S BECAUSE
OF THEIR EMOTIONAL ISSUES

03:19.433 --> 03:20.801
THAT I DIDN'T GO.
FELT UNCOMFORTABLE.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.636
GREAT, NOW THE WHOLE
OFFICE HATES ME.

03:22.670 --> 03:23.971
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.873
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
MY HEART HAS BEEN RIPPED OUT

03:25.906 --> 03:27.441
THROUGH MY EARS
AND THERE IS BLOOD

03:27.475 --> 03:29.510
SPURTING ALL OVER
INNOCENT TAMARA.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.679
THAT'S NOT SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

03:31.712 --> 03:33.314
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S FINE.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.783
BE TEAM PETER.
I DON'T NEED FRIENDS.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.252
I SPENT ALL OF FORM THREE
LOCKED IN A CUPBOARD.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.488
EXCUSE ME.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.822
(Mindy)
PETER...

03:41.855 --> 03:44.325
YOU KNOW KNOW A LOT
ABOUT SKEEVY GUY STUFF, RIGHT?

03:44.358 --> 03:45.526
I DO FOLLOW
THE INTERNET CHAT ROOMS

03:45.559 --> 03:47.328
UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT
SHUTS THEM DOWN.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.397
PERFECT, YOU'RE MY MOST
PERVERTED FRIEND.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.664
BE HONEST WITH ME.

03:50.698 --> 03:54.302
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN WITH A GIRL IN BED

03:54.335 --> 03:57.271
AND THEN
ACCIDENTALLY SLIPPED?

03:57.305 --> 03:58.138
NOPE.
DANNY'S LYING.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.007
WHAT? DANNY?
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DANNY.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.776
NO MAN IN THE HISTORY
OF TIME HAS EVER BEEN IN BED

04:02.810 --> 04:06.046
AND "SLIPPED"
AND NOT BEEN LYING.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.080
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

04:07.114 --> 04:09.317
WHAT'S THE MOST VALUABLE
THING IN THE WORLD TO YOU,

04:09.350 --> 04:11.319
THE THING THAT YOU TREASURE
ABOVE ALL ELSE?

04:11.352 --> 04:13.287
MY SIGNED PHOTO
OF KRIS JENNER.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.822
DO YOU EVER NOT KNOW
EXACTLY WHERE THAT IS

04:14.855 --> 04:16.424
OR EXACTLY WHAT'S DOING?

04:16.457 --> 04:19.593
NO, THAT THING'S LOCKED
BEHIND PLATE GLASS IN MY--

04:19.627 --> 04:21.562
THAT SON OF A--

04:21.595 --> 04:25.366
HEY, DANNY.
HEY.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.467
HEY.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.404
WOW, IS THAT
A SMILE I SEE?

04:30.438 --> 04:31.572
I THOUGHT I SAW
THE LAST OF THOSE.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.973
WELL, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT,

04:33.006 --> 04:34.942
AND I REALLY WANT
TO BELIEVE YOU.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.076
THEN BELIEVE ME.
JUST BELIEVE ME.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.345
I BELIEVE YOU
ALL THE TIME.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.846
I BELIEVE
THAT YOU FLOSS.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.314
I BELIEVE
THAT YOUR GYM IS CLOSED

04:40.348 --> 04:42.383
FOR A MULTI-YEAR REMODEL.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.951
THAT'S SWEET.
YEAH.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.353
YOU'RE SWEET.
THANKS.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.355
WHICH IS WHY
I WILL BELIEVE YOU...
GREAT.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.324
IF YOU SWEAR TO GOD
THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.693
OH, LET'S LEAVE GOD
OUT OF THIS.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.328
HE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT US.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.464
I TOLD HIM
YOU WERE MY ASSISTANT.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.433
OKAY, I'M--
I'M GONNA LEVEL WITH YOU.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.934
YEAH, LEVEL AWAY,
PERVERT.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.937
OKAY, HERE IT GOES.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.473
MY EYES
HAVE GOTTEN BAD,

05:05.506 --> 05:07.508
REALLY BAD,
AND IN THE DARK,

05:07.541 --> 05:09.777
I-I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.580
IT'S JUST A BIG--
BIG JUMBLE OF PARTS.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.081
DANNY, WHY DIDN'T
YOU JUST TELL ME?

05:14.114 --> 05:16.350
WELL, BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS
GIVE ME A HARD TIME

05:16.384 --> 05:17.785
ABOUT BEING OLD.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.487
IF YOU GO BLIND,
I'M GONNA GET SO FAT.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.754
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.456
LET'S JUST FORGET ABOUT IT
AND MOVE PAST IT.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.091
IF I DON'T SEE EVER AGAIN,
I DON'T SEE.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.126
OH, MY SWEET DANNY.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.695
WE'RE GONNA GO
TO THE OPHTHALMOLOGIST.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.463
WE'RE GONNA GO SEE
COLIN RIGHT NOW.
NOW?

05:29.497 --> 05:31.131
(Colin)
FANTASTIC NEWS, DANNY.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.101
YOU ARE NOT GOING BLIND.
YOUR EYES ARE FINE.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.068
COLIN, AS A DOCTOR,

05:35.102 --> 05:37.438
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU ARE WRONG.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.640
AS AN EYE DOCTOR,
I HAVE TO TELL YOU I AM RIGHT.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.375
OKAY, OKAY,
DON'T PHONE THIS IN, MAN.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.644
COME ON, LET'S--
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.584
DANNY, MINDY,
I AM SO GLAD

05:50.618 --> 05:52.853
I STEPPED AWAY
FROM MY SON'S SECOND BIRTHDAY

05:52.886 --> 05:57.425
TO WADE INTO WHAT IS CLEARLY
A RELATIONSHIP ISSUE.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.892
I'M GONNA GO.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.762
COLIN, COLIN,
I'M SO SORRY.
SORRY, COLIN.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.664
DID YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS
CALEB'S SECOND BIRTHDAY?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.466
YOU THINK I WANT TO HURT CALEB?
I LOVE CALEB.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.067
OKAY, FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.001
I DID IT ON PURPOSE.
I DID.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.405
I KNEW IT,
YOU STUPID SNEAK.
STOP, STOP.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.407
I ASSUMED YOU'D DONE
IT BEFORE, OKAY?
WHAT?

06:13.441 --> 06:14.642
YEAH, YOU'RE ALWAYS
BRAGGING ABOUT

06:14.675 --> 06:15.843
YOU'RE SO CRAZY
IN THE SACK.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.445
I JUST ASSUMED
YOU'D DONE IT BEFORE

06:17.478 --> 06:19.680
WITH YOUR LONG LIST
OF COMPANIONS.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.114
IS THAT WHAT
YOU THINK OF ME?

06:21.148 --> 06:22.916
THAT I'M JUST SOME, LIKE,
GORGEOUS, HIGH-CLASS PROSTITUTE?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.618
LOOK, I'VE SEEN
YOUR CABLE BILL, ALL RIGHT?

06:24.652 --> 06:26.654
YOU'RE NOT PAY-PER-VIEWING
BOXING MATCHES.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.723
I'M SORRY.
THAT IS ANIME PORNOGRAPHY,

06:29.757 --> 06:31.091
OKAY, WHICH IS
A VICTIMLESS CRIME.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.159
THE ONLY VICTIMS
ARE THE ANIMATORS.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.794
THEY PAY THEM NEXT
TO NOTHING IN KOREA.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.162
WHAT?
DOESN'T MATTER.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.865
I WILL NOT BE SLUT-SHAMED
IN AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST OFFICE.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.767
I'M GONNA LEAVE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:39.800 --> 06:43.036
DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET ANY IDEAS.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.840
OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
MINDY.

06:50.778 --> 06:51.812
(Mindy)
OH, COOKIE DOUGH,

06:51.845 --> 06:53.981
PLEASE SOLVE MY PROBLEMS.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.016
(Peter)
OH, MINDY.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.985
STRESS EATING
COOKIE DOUGH?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.621
WAS I RIGHT
ABOUT DANNY?
YES.

07:00.654 --> 07:01.855
AND THE WORST PART
IS, PETER,

07:01.889 --> 07:04.792
HE THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING
I HAD DONE THOUSANDS OF TIMES,

07:04.825 --> 07:06.594
LIKE JAYWALKING
OR LYING UNDER OATH.

07:06.627 --> 07:07.895
IS THAT
WHAT HE THINKS OF ME?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.863
WELL, I MEAN, ALL YOUR SHORTS
DO SAY "PORN STAR"

07:09.897 --> 07:10.864
ACROSS THE BACK.

07:10.898 --> 07:11.699
BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.001
LOOK, I KNOW
THAT I TALK THIS BIG TALK,

07:14.034 --> 07:15.869
BUT REALLY, I'M A PRUDE.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.538
A PRUDE THAT SLAYS DUDES
LIKE WHOA,

07:17.571 --> 07:18.606
BUT STILL.
MM-HMM.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.840
DANNY'S SO SEXUALLY EXPERIENCED.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.675
HE'S BEEN
WITH A TON OF WOMEN,

07:21.709 --> 07:23.544
AND I'M WORRIED
I'M BORING IN BED.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.946
IS THAT A BIG PROBLEM?
NO, STOP IT.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.147
NOT AT ALL.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.882
IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.551
I ALMOST BROKE UP
WITH THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS

07:30.584 --> 07:32.052
BECAUSE MY WATER BED
MADE HER SEASICK.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.987
I WOULD BREAK UP WITH YOU
FOR HAVING A WATER BED.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.889
LOOK, DANNY
LOVES YOU, OKAY?

07:35.923 --> 07:37.124
HE JUST EXPECTS YOU
TO KNOW EVERYTHING

07:37.157 --> 07:39.927
BECAUSE YOU'RE OLD.
HOT AS HELL.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.795
WELL, THERE'S PLENTY OF
OTHER STUFF YOU COULD DO

07:41.829 --> 07:42.830
THAT I'VE SEEN ONLINE,

07:42.863 --> 07:46.667
AWFUL, NASTY,
DEPRAVED STUFF.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.968
I COULD TEACH YOU.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.803
IF I WANTED TO HAVE
A HANDS-ON SEXUAL EDUCATION,

07:49.837 --> 07:50.871
I'D GO BACK
TO COMPUTER CAMP.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.506
I MEANT I COULD TALK YOU
THROUGH IT,

07:52.540 --> 07:54.141
DISPENSE MY KNOWLEDGE.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.643
I WILL WARN YOU,
THOUGH.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.845
MY COURSE IS GRADED
ON A CURVE.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.146
OH, MAN,
THAT WAS SO COOL.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.180
YEAH.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.820
[serene banjo playing]

08:06.854 --> 08:11.692
* HELLO, DARKNESS,
MY OLD FRIEND *

08:11.725 --> 08:14.127
* I'VE COME TO TALK
WITH YOU AGAIN *

08:14.161 --> 08:16.129
* AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN

08:16.163 --> 08:19.533
OH, A PERSON,
LIKE IN THE PICTURE.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.602
I'M ACTUALLY JUST WAITING
FOR EVERYBODY TO LEAVE.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.970
I DIDN'T WANT TO RUN INTO PETER
IN THE ELEVATOR

08:23.003 --> 08:23.971
AND START A ROW.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.040
NOW IT'S JUST ME
AND THE GREAT AMERICAN SONGBOOK.

08:27.074 --> 08:30.243
* WAY DOWN UPON

08:30.277 --> 08:32.913
* THE SWANEE RIVER
HUSH, HUSH, HUSH, STOP, STOP.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.648
* LONG--

08:34.682 --> 08:36.283
DR. REED, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT

08:36.316 --> 08:37.284
WITH ME TOMORROW NIGHT?

08:37.317 --> 08:38.586
YOU'D HAVE DINNER
WITH ME

08:38.619 --> 08:40.688
EVEN THOUGH
I'M THE OFFICE PARIAH?

08:40.721 --> 08:41.789
NOTHING WOULD
MAKE ME HAPPIER.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.023
OH, I KNOW
THIS GREAT PLACE.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.292
THE WAITRESSES WEAR
HOCKEY JERSEYS AND NO PANTS.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.861
THAT'S SO LOVELY, MORGAN.
I'LL PICK THE PLACE.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.763
BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
INVITING ME.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.098
AND NOW THAT I'M
A NURSE PRACTITIONER,

08:51.131 --> 08:52.666
IT'S ALSO MY TREAT.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.234
OH.

08:54.267 --> 08:57.237
JUST HAVE TO STOP AT
THE PAWNSHOP ON THE WAY.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.906
I'LL PAY.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.309
WELCOME TO PETER PRENTICE'S
BANGING IN BED BOOTY CAMP.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.977
FOR TONIGHT'S
DEMONSTRATION,

09:04.011 --> 09:05.312
I WILL BE PLAYING
THE PART OF DANNY,

09:05.345 --> 09:07.314
AND THE PART OF MINDY
WILL BE PLAYED BY--

09:07.347 --> 09:10.083
IF YOU SAY CEE LO GREEN,
I WILL KILL YOU.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.318
BRIAN THE SKELETON.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.820
OH, I GET IT.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.122
'CAUSE I'M SO SKINNY,
I'M LIKE A SKELETON.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.323
YEAH.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.692
SO WE'LL START
WITH THE BASICS,

09:18.726 --> 09:21.862
JUST A LITTLE
"HAVE YOU EVER?"

09:21.895 --> 09:23.931
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
HMM?
OF COURSE.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.899
HAVE YOU DONE THIS?
NO.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.069
NO.
NO.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.271
HOW IS IT EVEN SEXUAL?
OKAY.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.008
NO.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.110
I CALL THIS
THE NECK TIE.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.680
LET IT DROP,
AND THEN IT'S AN ASCOT.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.048
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT IS THAT?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.784
IT'S CALLED A BAGPIPE.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.953
MINDY, HELP.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.220
OH.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.090
DON'T GET SCARED, THE HIP IS
SUPPOSED TO POP OUT.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.692
STOP, STOP, STOP,
I'M JUST GONNA DO

09:51.725 --> 09:53.093
THE OTHER THING
THAT DANNY WANTS TO DO.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.127
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT

09:54.161 --> 09:56.096
AND YOU THINK IS EMPOWERING
FOR FEMINIST REASONS.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.798
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

09:57.831 --> 09:58.666
I'M GONNA DO IT,

09:58.699 --> 10:00.167
BECAUSE DANNY
IS AN AMAZING BOYFRIEND

10:00.200 --> 10:01.635
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE HIM.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.737
SO WHAT IF HE WANTS TO GO
TO FIFTH BASE?

10:03.771 --> 10:04.905
MAYBE I'LL LOVE IT.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.206
NO.
YOU WON'T.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.946
HEY, BUDDY.
YO.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.048
COOL GLASSES.
OH, THANK YOU.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.950
GOT THEM
AT THE SALVATION ARMY.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.952
ABOUT TO THROW THEM OUT.
I SAID, "I'LL TAKE THOSE."

10:18.986 --> 10:20.788
SO I GOT YOU A LITTLE
SOMETHING-SOMETHING

10:20.821 --> 10:23.891
FOR GRADUATING AND BECOMING
A NURSE PRACTITIONER.

10:23.924 --> 10:27.427
THE PHOTO OF YOU AND YOUR DAD
YOU KEEP ON YOUR DESK?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.096
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.364
THANK YOU.
YEAH.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.067
LOOK AT THOSE TWO LITTLE RASCALS
STARING AT ME.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.335
HEY, I'M SO SORRY
THAT I MISSED

10:35.368 --> 10:36.436
YOUR GRADUATION PARTY.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.905
IT WAS A GREAT PARTY.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.007
HAD THREE LARGE PIZZAS.
WENT DOWN TO THE DOCK.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.710
NO ONE SHOWED UP.
THE SEAGULLS WERE HAPPY.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.945
I THINK I JUST GOT
WRAPPED UP WITH MY BOYFRIEND,

10:44.978 --> 10:47.080
AND I FORGOT THE RELATIONSHIP
THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT,

10:47.114 --> 10:50.150
THAT OF A CASUAL
WORK ACQUAINTANCE.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.451
WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.953
TELL ME
EVERYTHING.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.289
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?
WHO HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.958
MY BOYFRIEND
THAT I MENTIONED.

10:57.991 --> 10:58.959
DUH, MY BEST FRIEND.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.894
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO KNOW.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.830
NOW THAT YOU'RE
A NURSE PRACTITIONER...
YEAH.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.431
YOU CAN PRESCRIBE
MEDICINE, RIGHT?

11:04.464 --> 11:05.866
OH, YEAH.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.768
NOW I'M JUST ANOTHER
DRUG DEALER FOR UNCLE SAM.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.369
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE,

11:09.402 --> 11:11.004
AM I RIGHT?
THAT'S A GREAT OBSERVATION.

11:11.038 --> 11:11.872
THANK YOU.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.741
I HAVE A LOT OF THEM,
BUT I DON'T EVEN

11:13.774 --> 11:14.942
HAVE A PEN
TO WRITE THEM DOWN.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.343
HEY, I NEED YOU
TO PRESCRIBE ME SOMETHING.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.012
I'M ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING
THAT I CANNOT BE AWAKE FOR,

11:19.046 --> 11:21.048
BUT I ALSO LEGALLY
CAN'T BE ASLEEP FOR.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.349
SO YOU'RE USING ME.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.884
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I EXPECTED MORE

11:23.917 --> 11:25.352
FROM MY DOG'S
GODMOTHER.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.987
MORGAN, COME ON
AND HELP ME!
OW!

11:27.020 --> 11:28.288
OKAY? IF YOU KNEW WHAT
I WAS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH,

11:28.321 --> 11:29.189
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.959
YOU KNOW I CAN'T PRESCRIBE IT
FOR MYSELF.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.327
OKAY, FINE.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.898
I'LL WRITE YOU A PRESCRIPTION
FOR A VERY STRONG SEDATIVE.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.733
I TAKE IT WHENEVER
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SCARY,

11:39.767 --> 11:43.403
LIKE WATCH A SCARY MOVIE
OR IF I HEAR A SCARY STORY

11:43.436 --> 11:45.305
OR, YOU KNOW...

11:45.338 --> 11:46.907
[speaking gibberish]

11:46.940 --> 11:49.042
ET CETERA,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.812
YOU CAN SAY IT
BOTH WAYS.
ALL RIGHT.

11:56.784 --> 11:57.885
HEY, WHAT YOU WATCHING?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.486
THE HISTORY CHANNEL'S
COUNTING DOWN

11:59.519 --> 12:02.089
HITLER'S 20 WACKIEST--

12:02.122 --> 12:04.091
WHOA.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.861
WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING
YOUR GRANDMA'S BATHROBE?

12:07.895 --> 12:08.996
I LOVE NANA'S BATHROBE,

12:09.029 --> 12:11.999
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
PROBABLY LIKE THIS

12:12.032 --> 12:13.433
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.202
AND YOU'RE SUCH
A GOOD BOYFRIEND

12:15.235 --> 12:17.871
THAT I THOUGHT TONIGHT
WE COULD DO THINGS

12:17.905 --> 12:19.973
THE WAY YOU LIKE.

12:22.109 --> 12:25.078
SCOTCH.
YEAH, A LITTLE SCOTCH.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.880
OKAY.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.548
[coughs]

12:28.581 --> 12:32.285
YOU OKAY?
MMM, YUCK.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.487
YOU KNOW WHAT GOES
REALLY WELL WITH SCOTCH?

12:34.521 --> 12:36.489
LET ME PUT ON
SOME THE BLUES.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.925
BLUES?
MM-HMM.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.492
OKAY, SURE.
I'LL PUT ON BLUES.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.161
YOU ALWAYS COMPLAIN
YOU DON'T RELATE

12:41.194 --> 12:42.863
TO THEIR
ETHNIC STRUGGLES.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.297
I THINK YOU'VE PROBABLY
GOTTEN ME CONFUSED

12:44.331 --> 12:46.199
WITH SOMEONE ELSE,
BECAUSE I HAVE GONE ON RECORD

12:46.233 --> 12:47.935
TO SAY HOW MUCH
I LOVE THE BLUES.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.803
[singing hoarsely]

12:49.837 --> 12:51.839
I LOVE THAT KIND OF STUFF,
JUST LIKE REAL COMPLAINY-LIKE.

12:51.872 --> 12:52.873
IT'S GOOD.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.574
I LIKE IT BETTER
THAN TAYLOR SWIFT.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.977
* ONE SUMMER
OH, MY EARS!

12:57.010 --> 12:57.978
WHAT?

12:58.011 --> 12:59.813
ARE LOVING IT.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.281
OKAY, WHAT'S
GOING ON?
WHAT?

13:01.314 --> 13:02.816
I LOVE SCOTCH
AND I LOVE THE BLUES.

13:02.850 --> 13:03.884
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU DON'T.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.853
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:05.886 --> 13:08.188
WAIT, IS THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT
I SAID IN THE EYE DOCTOR?

13:08.221 --> 13:09.522
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ONE OF

13:09.556 --> 13:11.291
THESE SEXUALLY
FREAKY-DEAKY PEOPLE.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.159
I DON'T THINK
YOU ARE, OKAY?

13:12.192 --> 13:14.862
THE OTHER NIGHT,
YES, I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.864
THE GIANTS WON.
I USED MY PIZZA STONE.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.832
YOU WERE WEARING
THOSE SEXY STOCKINGS.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.200
MY COMPRESSION SOCKS.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.302
THE POINT IS, WE DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT STUFF.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.104
IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE IT
WITH SO MANY GIRLS

13:24.137 --> 13:25.005
AND NOW IT'S
BORING TO YOU

13:25.038 --> 13:26.439
AND YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING EVEN WEIRDER?

13:26.473 --> 13:29.576
I WILL NOT LET YOU PEE ON ME.
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING AT ALL.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.478
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
WHEN I'M WITH YOU, IT'S ENOUGH.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.980
COOL.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.614
THAT'S NICE.
YOU KNOW?

13:34.647 --> 13:37.384
WE DON'T NEED ALL THOSE,
FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS,

13:37.417 --> 13:38.518
FIREWORKS.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.889
I MEAN, WE ARE
VERY, VERY, VERY,

13:41.922 --> 13:43.924
VERY COMFORTABLE TOGETHER,
LIKE AN OLD SHOE.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.293
I'M AN OLD SHOE.
YEAH, LIKE WHAT
NURSES WEAR.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.196
LIKE WHAT BEVERLY
WOULD WEAR.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.532
ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GET
THIS NIGHTTIME ROUTINE GOING.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.002
THESE CHOMPERS AREN'T GONNA
WATER PICK THEMSELVES.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.140
[sighs]

14:00.173 --> 14:01.141
(Jeremy)
OH, MORGAN,

14:01.174 --> 14:02.642
I'M SO DESPERATELY LONELY.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.545
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF I'VE PAID
TOO HIGH A PRICE FOR LOVE.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.547
I KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.017
I MEAN, TAMARA AND I CAN'T WALK
THROUGH HARLEM TOGETHER,

14:10.050 --> 14:11.651
'CAUSE WE'RE IN A LIMO.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.886
WHAT?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.487
I'M OUT OF MONEY.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.889
WHAT THE HELL IS HE
DOING HERE?

14:15.923 --> 14:18.926
LET ME EXPLAIN.
LET ME EXPLAIN.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.995
I INVITED BOTH
OF YOU HERE BECAUSE I--

14:22.029 --> 14:23.496
ARE YOU TRYING
TO PARENT TRAP US?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.032
ARE YOU THE LINDSAY LOHAN--

14:25.065 --> 14:26.900
I SAID
LET ME EXPLAIN.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.201
BUT THAT'S
EXACTLY RIGHT.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.903
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF HOW
I WOULD'VE EXPLAINED IT.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.071
OKAY, PLEASE,
ENOUGH FIGHTING.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.306
EVERYONE'S SICK OF IT.
SIT DOWN.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.274
SIT DOWN.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.243
THE THREE OF US
ARE GONNA BE AT THIS TABLE.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.578
WE'RE GONNA CRACK OPEN
A NICE OLD BOTTLE

14:38.611 --> 14:40.513
OF RED KETCHUP,

14:40.547 --> 14:42.482
AND WE'RE GONNA DUMP IT
ON OUR FRIES,

14:42.515 --> 14:44.684
AND WE'RE GONNA CHOW DOWN,
AND WE'RE GONNA EAT.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.486
AND WE'RE GONNA GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS,

14:46.519 --> 14:48.388
AND I'M GONNA MEDIATE,
AND I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE--

14:48.421 --> 14:51.258
EXCUSE ME.
DR. L'S TEXTING ME.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.629
DR. PRENTICE, DR. REED,
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.031
[phone blips]

15:02.970 --> 15:05.338
[phone blips]

15:05.372 --> 15:07.174
OH, MY GOD.

15:07.207 --> 15:10.143
I MISS
AND LOVE YOU TOO.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.679
EXCLAM, EXCLAM,
EXCLAM, EXCLAM.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.214
[phone blips]

15:14.247 --> 15:16.216
[chuckles]

15:19.586 --> 15:21.521
[laughs]

15:21.554 --> 15:24.657
I'VE ACTUALLY WRITTEN YOU
AN APOLOGY POEM.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.260
IT'S CALLED
MASTER AND APPRENTICE.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.261
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HEAR IT?

15:28.295 --> 15:29.596
I WOULD LOVE TO

15:29.629 --> 15:31.298
TAKE THAT POEM
AND SHOVE IT DOWN YOUR THROAT

15:31.331 --> 15:33.033
AND THEN GIVE YOU THE FINGER
THROUGH YOUR BELLY BUTTON.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.667
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:34.701 --> 15:37.070
I DIDN'T STEAL LAUREN.
SHE LEFT YOU.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.438
YOU KNOW WHY?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.507
'CAUSE YOU'RE OVER 30,
YET YOU HAVE FOUR ROOMMATES,

15:40.540 --> 15:43.110
TWO PAIR OF UNDERPANTS,
AND NO TOOTHBRUSH.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.577
YOU WERE THE ONE
THAT GOT HER THINKING

15:44.611 --> 15:45.578
THOSE THINGS WERE BAD.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.614
WELL, YOUR FACE
IS BAD.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.086
OH, MY FACE!

15:53.120 --> 15:54.587
MORGAN, HE'S ON FIRE.
MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!

15:54.621 --> 15:56.389
OH, MY GOD!

15:56.423 --> 15:59.426
DANNY, I AGREED TO GO
ON VACATION WITH MORGAN, OKAY?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.228
WHY DON'T YOU COOL IT
ON THE DRINKS, ALL RIGHT?

16:01.261 --> 16:02.562
YOU'RE BEING
REAL FUNNY TONIGHT.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.431
YEAH, I FEEL HILARIOUS.
COME HERE.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.665
COME HERE,
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU LAUGH.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.267
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU LAUGH
ALL NIGHT.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.635
HOLD ON A SEC,
I'M STILL WORKING MY EARS.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.738
[echoing]
WOW, IT'S GONNA BE
A TWO SWABBER.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.540
HUH?
HUH?

16:13.573 --> 16:14.541
WHAT?

16:14.574 --> 16:17.744
OH, BOY.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.413
OKAY.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.416
[playful music]

16:23.450 --> 16:24.484
*

16:24.517 --> 16:26.153
DANNY, DANNY.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.421
DANNY, SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD
IS HAPPENING, DANNY.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.123
DANNY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:30.157 --> 16:32.425
NOTHING.
I JUST MISSED YOU A LOT.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.027
HEY.

16:34.061 --> 16:37.064
AND I'M FEELING
SUPER HORNY.
YOU OKAY?

16:37.097 --> 16:38.765
OH.
OH, GOD.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.533
[chuckles]

16:40.567 --> 16:42.769
MINDY.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.304
MIN.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.705
[shouts]
OH, MY GOD, MINDY.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.576
I'M DETECTIVE
OLIVIA PENDERGHAST.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.445
MA'AM, WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU WERE ROOFIE'D

16:52.479 --> 16:55.415
WITH INTENT
BY THIS MAN.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.318
WAIT A MINUTE, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE FROM HOSPITAL BILLING.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.519
OKAY, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.787
HE IS MY BOYFRIEND.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.789
IT'S ALWAYS THE ONES
YOU TRUST.
NO, NO.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.258
HE DID NOT ROOFIE ME.
I ROOFIE'D MYSELF.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.160
WHAT?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.695
ARE YOU SURE?
YOU WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE?

17:08.728 --> 17:11.331
'CAUSE I THINK
IT WAS THIS GUY.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.499
NO, I'M SORRY.
HE'S INNOCENT.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.734
YOU MAKE ME SICK.

17:14.767 --> 17:15.535
IT'S SCUM LIKE YOU

17:15.568 --> 17:18.505
THAT MAKE ME
DRINK MYSELF TO SLEEP.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.607
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
IT WASN'T SO BAD.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.609
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
OKAY, WAIT.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.411
NOW I'M GONNA BE
IN THE POLICE BLOTTER.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.513
THAT'S YOUR THING.
OKAY, I'M
SO SORRY, DANNY.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.680
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:27.714 --> 17:28.748
NO!

17:28.781 --> 17:29.749
OH, MY GOD.

17:29.782 --> 17:30.750
WHOA, WHOA, DANNY.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.452
YOUR SEX PUT HER
IN THE HOSPITAL.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.753
WHAT ARE YOU PACKING, BWABY?

17:33.786 --> 17:35.588
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU TOLD PETE THIS?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.190
I TOLD HIM BECAUSE
I WAS VERY STRESSED OUT

17:37.224 --> 17:38.258
ABOUT OUR SITUATION.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.560
HE OFFERED TO--
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EYEBROWS?

17:40.593 --> 17:41.728
ASK JEREMY.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.530
IT WASN'T ENOUGH
HE TOOK LAUREN FROM ME.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.532
HE HAD TO TAKE THE ONLY STRAIGHT
HAIRS ON MY BODY AS WELL.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.799
YOU GOT PLENTY
ON YOUR BACK, YOU--

17:46.833 --> 17:48.735
THOSE ARE STRAIGHT!
THOSE ARE STRAIGHT!

17:48.768 --> 17:50.537
THE ONES ON MY BACK
ARE CURLED!

17:50.570 --> 17:51.338
OKAY, OKAY.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.839
YOU GUYS ARE BEING
CRAZY DRAMATIC.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.507
THIS IS COMING FROM
THE MOST DRAMATIC PERSON HERE.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.209
REMEMBER WHEN I ALMOST JUMPED
OFF THAT LOW BRIDGE

17:56.243 --> 17:57.377
BECAUSE I DIDN'T AGREE
WITH THE AMERICAN IDOL RESULTS?

17:57.410 --> 18:00.180
CLAY AIKEN.
THIS FEUD IS LAME,
AND IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.215
YEAH, YOU GUYS AREN'T EVEN
FAMOUS ENOUGH TO BE IN A FEUD.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.717
YOU'RE JUST TWO BASICS
HAVING A BITCH FEST.
YES.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.453
OKAY, COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S DO IT.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.854
BURY THE HATCHET.
COME ON.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.289
WHAT DO YOU SAY, PETER?

18:09.322 --> 18:11.258
SHOULD WE FORGE
A DETENTE DE GUERRE?

18:11.291 --> 18:12.459
AT WORK,
WE WILL NOT FIGHT,

18:12.492 --> 18:14.294
BUT OUTSIDE OF WORK,
WE'LL FIGHT CONSTANTLY.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.528
AND WILL YOU PLEASE
SAY ONE SENTENCE

18:15.562 --> 18:16.563
LIKE A HUMAN BEING?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.798
INDUBITABLY.
DAMN IT.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.868
I LOOK LIKE SKELETOR.

18:21.901 --> 18:25.205
WHAT'S GOING ON?
BABE, PLEASE
LET ME EXPLAIN.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.540
BABE, JUST LET ME EXPLAIN
THE DETAILS OF OUR VACATION,

18:27.574 --> 18:30.677
WHICH IS GONNA BE AMAZING.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.215
HEY, I BOUGHT A SODA,
AND TWO CAME OUT.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.616
WERE YOU NOT
GONNA GET ME ONE?

18:36.649 --> 18:38.751
YEAH, NO, I WAS.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.287
MINDY, WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE NOT

18:40.320 --> 18:41.554
SEXUALLY ADVANCED
ENOUGH FOR ME?

18:41.588 --> 18:43.523
BECAUSE YOU CALLED ME
AN OLD SHOE,

18:43.556 --> 18:45.192
AND YOU'RE BASICALLY
LIKE JAMES CAAN

18:45.225 --> 18:46.226
AT THE PLAYBOY MANSION.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.427
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
NO MORE LIES.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.861
YOU WANT THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT?

18:48.895 --> 18:50.630
HAVE I GIVEN YOU
THE IMPRESSION THAT I DON'T?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.532
OKAY, HERE'S
THE REAL TRUTH.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.301
DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING,

18:54.334 --> 18:55.502
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE ANYTHING.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.605
I JUST TRIED SOMETHING,
ALL RIGHT?

18:58.638 --> 19:01.674
THAT'S IT.

19:01.708 --> 19:05.212
BECAUSE AMERICA WAS BUILT
ON TRYING THINGS.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.214
OKAY.
NO, NO, NO,
THIS IS GOOD.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.282
WHEN THE PIONEERS
WENT OUT WEST

19:09.316 --> 19:10.683
ON THE WAGON TRAIN,

19:10.717 --> 19:12.419
THEY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE GONNA FIND,

19:12.452 --> 19:14.854
BEARS, SCORPIONS,
BUT THEY JUST TRIED IT OUT.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.423
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY FOUND.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.858
WEED.
NO, NOT WEED.
GOLD, THE GRAND CANYON.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.360
I MEAN, CALIFORNIA,
NO, THANKS,

19:20.393 --> 19:21.628
BUT THE SAN DIEGO
ZOO'S NICE.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.396
IN AMERICA,
YOU JUST GO FOR IT.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.864
YOU JUST GO FOR IT,
AND, YEAH,

19:24.897 --> 19:26.233
SOMETIMES YOU PAY
THE PRICE,

19:26.266 --> 19:27.834
BUT OTHER TIMES--

19:27.867 --> 19:29.802
OTHER TIMES,
JACKPOT.

19:29.836 --> 19:33.506
OKAY, I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS,
HOW THIS IS THE REAL TRUTH.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.407
BECAUSE IT IS.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.709
SOMETIMES A GUY
JUST HAS TO TRY SOMETHING.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.446
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THIS BEFORE?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.348
'CAUSE I'D NEVER
DONE IT BEFORE.

19:41.381 --> 19:44.284
NEITHER HAVE I.
YOU HAVEN'T?

19:44.317 --> 19:48.355
NO.
OH, WELL...

19:48.388 --> 19:49.989
THAT'S GOOD.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.758
SEE THAT, BIG GUY?
WE CAN WORK WITH THAT.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.560
OKAY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO CLEAR ME WITH GOD.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.794
I'M FINE.
GOD'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.297
HEY, TAKE IT EASY.
SHE'S TAKEN.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.698
JUST KIDDING.
JUST KIDDING.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.333
SO WE GOOD?
WE ARE.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.734
JUST IF YOU WANT
TO TRY SOMETHING FREAKY,

20:01.768 --> 20:02.835
JUST RUN IT
BY ME FIRST.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.238
YES, I PROMISE.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.839
YOU EVER HAVE SEX
IN A HOSPITAL BED?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.308
DANNY, SOMEONE COULD
WALK IN.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.642
I SHOULD'VE JUST
STARTED KISSING YOU.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.411
ASKING SUCKS.
DAMN IT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.612
YEAH.
NO, NO.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.614
THE MOMENT'S--
YEAH, IT'S RUINED.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.916
LET'S DRINK OUR SODAS
AND WATCH COLBERT.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.217
OKAY.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.355
MORGAN, PETER AND I HAVE BEEN
DOING SOME THINKING.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.357
YOU'RE GONNA
SHARE LAUREN.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.693
WEEKDAYS, WEEKENDS.
THIS IS A GOOD PLAN.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.527
NO.
GOD, NO, NO.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.562
NO, NO, WE JUST
CAME HERE TO SAY,

20:29.596 --> 20:30.430
IN THE MIDST
OF OUR FEUD,

20:30.463 --> 20:32.365
WE DID NEGLECT
TO GIVE YOU PROPER DUE

20:32.399 --> 20:34.000
FOR YOUR NEW DEGREE.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.603
WE GOT YOU SOMETHING.
IT'S FROM THE HEART.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.975
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.478
DO YOU HAVE, LIKE,
A GIFT RECEIPT?

20:45.512 --> 20:48.281
GIFT RECEIPT?
I MEAN, YOUR--IT'S--
YOUR NAME'S ON IT.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.449
IT'S MONOGRAMMED.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.551
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOOKERS
WITH AN S.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.586
WE GAVE IT A SHOT.
IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.587
I WILL WEAR IT
WITH PRIDE.

20:54.621 --> 20:55.922
AWESOME.
AT HOME.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.724
YOU GUYS,
I LOVE IT.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.326
I LOVE IT.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.995
(Mindy)
OOH, OUR FIRST FREAKY
CONSENSUAL ADVENTURE.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.431
YEAH.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.306
AH!

21:13.340 --> 21:14.574
[groans]

21:14.607 --> 21:16.075
YOU BIT MY TONGUE.
I'M SO SORRY.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.578
THE WHIPPED CREAM
JUST TASTED SO DELICIOUS.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.813
OW, MINDY, GOD.
OW!

21:20.847 --> 21:22.915
GOD, MINDY,
GET OFF MY HAND!

21:22.949 --> 21:24.551
NO!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:24.584 --> 21:25.552
OW!

21:25.585 --> 21:27.554
MINDY, LET GO.
LET GO OF MY HAND.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.555
OW!

21:28.588 --> 21:29.622
DANNY, IT JUST TASTES
SO GOOD.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.491
I'M SO SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.593
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WE JUST ATE.
