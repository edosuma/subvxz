00:04.671 --> 00:09.593
As one age passes into memory,
another finds its beginnings.

00:16.434 --> 00:18.602
Out of the ashes of the Breaking,

00:18.686 --> 00:23.940
surviving factions of female Aes Sedai
emerged into a new world.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.193
They met under common cause,

00:27.277 --> 00:30.114
to protect the world
from further devastation.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.409
While male Aes Sedai
continued their descent

00:34.493 --> 00:36.369
into madness and destruction,

00:36.454 --> 00:41.082
the island of Tar Valon was chosen,
and the White Tower was born,

00:42.250 --> 00:46.881
a base dedicated to progress,
research and training.

00:49.716 --> 00:54.804
Here, those with the natural ability
to channel are welcomed as novices

00:54.889 --> 00:56.347
to begin their training.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.851
From novice-hood, years may pass

00:59.935 --> 01:03.314
before a sacred serpent ring
is placed on one's finger,

01:03.396 --> 01:06.233
raising her to the level of Accepted.

01:06.650 --> 01:11.989
And long after, when deemed ready,
the Accepted take the Three Oaths

01:12.072 --> 01:14.950
and are raised to wear the shawl
as Aes Sedai.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.871
Those lucky enough to get called
to the shawl will choose their Ajah,

01:19.954 --> 01:24.001
of seven factions,
each with their own specific purpose.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.212
Warriors standing ready.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.799
Healers of all things living.

01:29.882 --> 01:32.134
Keepers of the past.

01:32.218 --> 01:34.385
Seekers of justice.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.388
Law-focused diplomats.

01:36.472 --> 01:39.098
Pursuers of truth and reason.

01:39.891 --> 01:43.478
And those dedicated to preventing
the wrong and dangerous use

01:43.561 --> 01:44.646
of the One Power.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.864
The Hall of the Tower
is our central council,

01:53.948 --> 01:57.075
represented by three sitters
from each Ajah.

01:59.161 --> 02:02.873
Here, we vote and deliberate
over important matters.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.378
On the throne, the Amyrlin Seat.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.840
Here, I was sworn in

02:10.923 --> 02:14.551
as the Watcher of the Seals,
the Flame of Tar Valon.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.135
Chosen for life.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.560
It was no accident that
we chose the island of Tar Valon

02:22.643 --> 02:25.228
in plain view of Dragonmount.

02:26.479 --> 02:30.067
It's a message, spoken to all generations.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.694
A reminder of the past,

02:32.777 --> 02:36.990
a warning that
the Dragon Reborn will come...

02:37.074 --> 02:38.283
one day.
