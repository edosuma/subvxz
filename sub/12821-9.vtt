WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.740
<i>Previously on "zero hour"...</i>

00:01.775 --> 00:03.380
I am gonna find
the true cross

00:03.415 --> 00:04.540
And I'm gonna destroy it.

00:04.575 --> 00:05.745
Come with me.

00:05.780 --> 00:07.580
I'm confident to have
the cross in my possession

00:07.615 --> 00:09.145
Within the week.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.425
I've seen things, dad-

00:10.460 --> 00:12.700
A nazi officer
with my face.

00:12.735 --> 00:14.905
He looked exactly like me.

00:14.940 --> 00:16.825
I dream about a man
with a gun.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.940
The location of the cross
must be secret.

00:18.975 --> 00:21.820
I will not put it
in the mud.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.785
Don't do this. Please.

00:23.820 --> 00:28.460
I always imagined I'd be buried
in a grave on a hilltop.

00:28.495 --> 00:31.300
this is our answer-
the location of the cross.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.340
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.677
I have. That's theo.

00:35.712 --> 00:37.980
That's my husband.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.200
<i>8 is forever a line</i>

00:48.235 --> 00:50.525
<i>Without end.</i>

00:50.560 --> 00:54.480
<i>The worst sort of murder
is that of a friend.</i>

01:02.640 --> 01:06.205
commander dietrich
was a good man.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.880
We therefore commit his body
to the sea,

01:08.915 --> 01:11.520
Looking for
the general resurrection

01:11.555 --> 01:13.325
In the last days

01:13.360 --> 01:15.300
And the life of the world
to come

01:15.335 --> 01:17.240
Through
our lord jesus christ-

01:19.400 --> 01:21.165
At ease! At ease!

01:21.200 --> 01:23.965
It's only st. Elmo's fire.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.680
Electrical phenomena
from the storm.

01:25.715 --> 01:28.197
Perhaps it's a sign
from above

01:28.232 --> 01:30.680
That we're on
the wrong path.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.405
We should move on.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.400
You can't stop a burial
mid-rights, sir.

01:34.435 --> 01:36.005
It's bad luck
for the dead.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.285
The storm does not afford us
much time.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.800
We come to the faroes
with a far higher agenda.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.140
This was made in 1938-

01:54.175 --> 01:56.365
No gps, no google maps.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.520
Everything the apostles needed
to find the cross

01:59.555 --> 02:01.325
Has to be in here.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.120
And all it's telling us is-

02:04.155 --> 02:05.805
The faroe islands.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.240
The thing about
these puzzles is,

02:08.275 --> 02:10.616
There's always
enough information.

02:10.651 --> 02:12.960
We've just got to learn
how to see it.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.240
It's just an air pocket.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.645
Yeah, I know.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.400
You know, for once I'm not
thinking about turbulence.

02:26.435 --> 02:28.560
I keep thinking about
the footage of theo.

02:28.595 --> 02:30.977
I see his face,

02:31.012 --> 02:33.325
I know it's him...

02:33.360 --> 02:35.240
But you don't believe it?

02:36.240 --> 02:38.520
I'll believe it
when I see it,

02:38.555 --> 02:40.840
When I see him.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.960
Theo, you here?

02:54.840 --> 02:57.600
Oh, are you working?
I can come back later.

02:57.635 --> 02:58.760
No, no, no, no.
Come here. Come here.

02:58.795 --> 03:00.085
Hi. Mm.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.480
Check this out.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.325
Okay.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.805
This plant

03:04.840 --> 03:07.540
And this plant
are exactly the same.

03:07.575 --> 03:10.240
They can replicate
on their own.

03:10.275 --> 03:13.357
Vegetative propagation.

03:13.392 --> 03:15.936
It is as old as time...

03:15.971 --> 03:18.480
But it still amazes me.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.160
As you do me.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.640
Where'd that come from?

03:31.200 --> 03:33.085
You remember
that conversation

03:33.120 --> 03:36.240
That we had
on the way back from laos?

03:38.960 --> 03:40.520
It's all right.

03:40.555 --> 03:42.085
Really.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.645
I've made my peace
with it.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.960
If your heart is set
on not having a kid...

03:48.880 --> 03:51.085
I'm good with it.

03:51.120 --> 03:56.400
<i>But what if I'm not
good with it anymore?</i>

03:58.120 --> 03:59.740
Wait. What?

03:59.775 --> 04:01.127
You're not...

04:01.162 --> 04:02.445
I think-

04:02.480 --> 04:05.480
I-I don't think,
I-I know...

04:05.515 --> 04:07.577
I want to have kids.

04:07.612 --> 04:09.640
And now it's plural?

04:09.675 --> 04:11.560
In for a penny.

04:11.595 --> 04:12.525
Oh!

04:12.560 --> 04:14.680
I... You...

04:14.715 --> 04:17.279
You.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.079
You better hold
your horses.

04:21.115 --> 04:23.200
You're gonna miss
your flight.

04:23.235 --> 04:25.165
Oh.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.085
Moscow is gonna suck
right now.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.480
But just think about
how good it's gonna be

04:30.515 --> 04:32.737
When you get back.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.960
It's gonna be good.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.285
Five years in the care
of the pyrates

04:46.320 --> 04:49.960
Have done interesting stuff
to you, molars.

04:49.995 --> 04:51.365
How so?

04:51.400 --> 04:53.765
You were a man of science,

04:53.800 --> 04:56.200
Someone
who'd have no interest

04:56.235 --> 04:58.897
In supernatural mumbo jumbos

04:58.932 --> 05:01.560
Like this cross business.

05:01.595 --> 05:03.045
And yet,

05:03.080 --> 05:05.280
The closer
we get to finding it

05:05.315 --> 05:07.245
The more alive
you become.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.680
Or perhaps it's because
you're hoping your wife

05:09.715 --> 05:12.817
Will meet us there
and save you.

05:12.852 --> 05:15.920
My hopes died
a long time ago.

05:15.955 --> 05:17.200
You made sure of that.

05:17.235 --> 05:19.085
How about now?

05:19.120 --> 05:21.600
She boarded a flight
to the faroes

05:21.635 --> 05:24.080
Not six hours ago
with hank galliston,

05:24.115 --> 05:26.160
A man who means nothing
to you,

05:26.195 --> 05:28.080
But the world to me.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.805
How is it two men

05:32.840 --> 05:37.480
Can be so inextricably linked
through time...

05:37.515 --> 05:40.805
Together 75 years ago

05:40.840 --> 05:43.920
In an effort
to hide the cross,

05:43.955 --> 05:47.000
And now
racing simultaneously

05:47.035 --> 05:48.845
To get it?

05:48.880 --> 05:51.120
Well, you see things
I don't.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.440
There's a higher power
working.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.485
he hasn't
returned any of my calls.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.440
We've raised him too long,
loved him too much

06:03.475 --> 06:05.165
To lose him now.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.000
We raised him to have
a mind of his own, rose,

06:07.035 --> 06:08.605
To question everything.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.660
Now he's questioning us,
as he should.

06:10.695 --> 06:12.680
But if we don't tell him
the truth,

06:12.715 --> 06:13.925
He'll keep asking

06:13.960 --> 06:15.680
Until he finds someone
who will.

06:15.715 --> 06:17.365
The only thing more dangerous

06:17.400 --> 06:19.280
Than hank finding out
who he really is

06:19.315 --> 06:22.497
Is someone else
finding out.

06:22.532 --> 06:25.645
All right.
I'll talk to him.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.520
We just have to figure out
where he is.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.560
Hey, we're on the ground
in the faroes. How are you?

06:37.595 --> 06:38.685
fine.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.925
Back in the office.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.820
You're not gonna believe this,
but apparently

06:41.855 --> 06:45.541
We publish some sort of magazine. Listen,
We need a lead on where in the islands

06:45.576 --> 06:47.568
The shepherds could have buried
the cross.

06:47.603 --> 06:49.801
Can you look
in sturm's journals, letters,

06:49.836 --> 06:51.965
Anything that can tie him
to this place?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.800
Yeah, and-and check in
with your nazi friend.

06:53.835 --> 06:55.325
Yeah, you know
what's weird about that?

06:55.360 --> 06:57.800
Weirder than the fact that
we have a nazi friend?

06:57.835 --> 07:00.120
Listen, guys,
you gotta do this fast.

07:00.155 --> 07:01.725
You're not
starting to believe

07:01.760 --> 07:03.360
This end-of-the-world stuff,
are you?

07:04.840 --> 07:06.980
Just find me a lead.

07:07.015 --> 07:09.085
Talk to you later.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.485
this is where we split up.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.560
Than look for
someone's missing husband.

07:14.595 --> 07:16.560
Okay. Well, thanks, beck.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.245
Hey, I truly hope
you find him.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.280
Yeah, I hope you find
what you're looking for, too.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.540
We better get inside.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.760
A storm is coming.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.080
Vincent has company
in the faroes-

07:43.115 --> 07:44.160
Hank galliston.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.925
The magazine man,
"modern skeptic."

07:47.960 --> 07:51.760
Galliston has his wife back,
yet still he pursues vincent.

07:51.795 --> 07:54.760
Or perhaps it's something else
he seeks.

07:54.795 --> 07:57.640
Progress report, ms. Lynch.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.220
This disappoints me.

08:06.255 --> 08:08.165
The money we've spent,

08:08.200 --> 08:12.880
The efforts we've made
on six continents...

08:12.915 --> 08:15.885
How is it we're still
not ready?

08:15.920 --> 08:19.320
Today is the day
the cross will be found.

08:19.355 --> 08:23.480
Our lord expects us
to be prepared.

08:23.515 --> 08:26.045
The code...

08:26.080 --> 08:28.800
His code, is an elusive one.

08:28.835 --> 08:30.045
Figure it out.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.280
Act like the end of the world
is tomorrow,

08:33.315 --> 08:39.120
Because it just may be.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.045
It's riley. How far away
is the team?

08:59.080 --> 09:02.080
That's too long.
Vincent could be gone by-

09:02.115 --> 09:04.365
Sir, I have reason to believe

09:04.400 --> 09:06.200
That there is
a hostage on board.

09:06.235 --> 09:07.405
We can't afford-

09:07.440 --> 09:09.280
Look, we can't lose him a-

09:10.200 --> 09:12.120
You son of a bitch.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.440
The submarine's log
tells us they moored

09:17.475 --> 09:19.965
50 meters off the coast.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.880
So we look for a shoreline
with deep enough waters

09:22.915 --> 09:26.445
To accommodate
a submarine's draft.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.640
So they must have chosen
the windward side...

09:29.675 --> 09:31.977
With accessible shoreline

09:32.012 --> 09:34.280
To safely unload
the cross.

09:35.680 --> 09:39.880
A combination of which
there are very few

09:39.915 --> 09:41.440
In the faroes.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.045
<i>"despite the weather,</i>

09:46.080 --> 09:48.920
<i>"we are tasked with carrying on
with our part of the mission.</i>

09:48.955 --> 09:50.925
<i>"but sturm is in a different
sort of mood now,</i>

09:50.960 --> 09:54.560
<i>"as if he no longer trusts us
to undertake this holy mission.</i>

09:54.595 --> 09:56.245
<i>"he's taken a single man</i>

09:56.280 --> 09:58.045
<i>"and begun moving
his precious cargo</i>

09:58.080 --> 10:03.200
<i>"a place only a madman
would attempt in this storm.</i>

10:03.235 --> 10:04.765
<i>"but such is sturm's heart.</i>

10:04.800 --> 10:11.040
<i>And that his struggle tonight
is only between he and god."</i>

10:13.560 --> 10:15.405
holy mary, mother of god,

10:15.440 --> 10:17.640
Pray for us sinners now
and the hour of our death.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.125
Hail mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.880
Pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

10:26.915 --> 10:28.800
You're scared?

10:30.240 --> 10:32.085
'cause we're close.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.565
How do you know we're close

10:33.600 --> 10:35.200
When you don't even know
where we're headed?

10:35.235 --> 10:36.640
Can't you feel it?

10:37.760 --> 10:38.965
Yeah, I'm scared...

10:39.000 --> 10:40.765
Of god, of what they say,

10:40.800 --> 10:45.160
That somehow you and the cross
will bring the apocalypse.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.760
And I'm scared
of losing you.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.160
I don't believe
in a god

11:00.195 --> 11:02.760
That would do that.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.605
But...

11:05.640 --> 11:08.640
You do believe in god?

11:16.080 --> 11:20.640
I believe that there are things
beyond our comprehension,

11:20.675 --> 11:22.645
That math and science
have proved

11:22.680 --> 11:27.360
That we can't possibly perceive
everything that's out there.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.840
Is one of those things
a higher power,

11:31.875 --> 11:33.405
A god?

11:33.440 --> 11:36.640
I don't know.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.765
Yeah.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.965
you're here, aren't you?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.645
That depends on where here is.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.600
I wonder if you know why
you're really drawn here.

11:49.635 --> 11:51.937
Is it the cross
or something more,

11:51.972 --> 11:54.205
Something deep beneath
our psyche

11:54.240 --> 11:57.120
That compels us in ways
we don't even know?

11:57.155 --> 11:59.325
In my case,
what would that be?

11:59.360 --> 12:02.180
To atone for your sins.
That's why you come here.

12:02.215 --> 12:05.187
To meet the judgment
that you know you deserve.

12:05.222 --> 12:08.160
Sounds like your wheels
are coming loose, vincent.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.520
What about a wager then,

12:12.555 --> 12:14.525
That you and I,

12:14.560 --> 12:16.860
Without even trying,
end up

12:16.895 --> 12:19.160
At the location
of the cross?

12:19.195 --> 12:21.720
And this time, brother,

12:21.755 --> 12:23.520
<i>I kill you.</i>

12:55.360 --> 12:58.240
we really have to
stop meeting like this.

12:58.275 --> 12:59.805
People will start talking.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.925
oh, trust me.
They already do.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.440
Why is it always
about korbin sturm?

13:05.475 --> 13:06.845
I, uh...

13:06.880 --> 13:10.240
I have plenty of information
about other nazis, you know?

13:10.275 --> 13:11.325
Oh, yeah?

13:11.360 --> 13:14.560
Sturm's all the nazi we can
handle at the moment, thanks.

13:14.595 --> 13:17.760
We're just trying to find out
if there's any connection

13:17.795 --> 13:18.880
In his family
to the faroe islands.

13:18.915 --> 13:21.120
Oh, not that I know of.

13:21.155 --> 13:22.605
But what I gather,

13:22.640 --> 13:25.920
He arrived there
by submarine,

13:25.955 --> 13:29.200
A submarine
later lost at sea.

13:29.235 --> 13:30.837
Unh, unh, unh.

13:30.872 --> 13:32.405
Not so fast.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.240
What are you chasing?

13:34.275 --> 13:36.040
It's just for an article

13:36.075 --> 13:37.485
For the magazine.

13:37.520 --> 13:41.440
Well, first you two come
sniffing around about sturm,

13:41.475 --> 13:43.837
Then your boss,
sturm's shadow,

13:43.872 --> 13:46.200
Double walks through my doors.

13:46.235 --> 13:48.125
If I were a gambling man,

13:48.160 --> 13:52.480
I'd wager something's...
Afoot.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.440
Is this a crew photo
from the submarine?

14:02.840 --> 14:05.080
U-215, yes.

14:05.115 --> 14:07.080
Arron.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.240
Well, things just took
a massive right turn.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.680
Yes, it certainly did.

14:24.920 --> 14:30.200
Why don't you tell me
what's really going on here?

14:34.960 --> 14:36.400
we're gonna be pushing off.

14:36.435 --> 14:38.000
Good.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.880
Oh, my god.

15:10.915 --> 15:13.005
Oh, my god.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.840
Oh, my god. Theo, baby.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.960
We have to go.
We have to get off.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.280
What are you doing?
We need to move.

15:31.315 --> 15:33.437
I, uh...

15:33.472 --> 15:35.525
I can't.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.480
Yes, you can.
I'll protect you.

15:37.515 --> 15:39.040
No.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.360
I'm not going with you.

15:48.660 --> 15:50.105
I-I can't go with you,
rebecca.

15:50.140 --> 15:51.340
What are you-
what are you talking about?

15:51.375 --> 15:53.340
This is the place
I belong now.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.825
No, no, no.

15:54.860 --> 15:56.140
I don't care what they've
threatened you with-

15:56.175 --> 15:58.340
I'm telling you
it's okay.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.557
It's okay.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.740
I belong here.

16:04.820 --> 16:05.900
Don't say that, baby-

16:07.740 --> 16:09.505
Listen to me, rebecca,

16:09.540 --> 16:11.293
I can't go with you,
but you've gotta leave.

16:11.303 --> 16:11.420
Wait.

16:11.455 --> 16:13.060
This is the place
I belong.

16:13.095 --> 16:14.660
No. No, theo. No!

16:18.340 --> 16:20.240
Somebody!

16:20.275 --> 16:21.667
Help!

16:21.702 --> 16:23.141
Help!

16:23.176 --> 16:25.158
Help me!

16:25.193 --> 16:27.140
Help! Help!

16:27.175 --> 16:29.780
hey!

17:12.660 --> 17:14.060
10 yellows,

17:14.095 --> 17:15.460
3 blue...

17:16.819 --> 17:17.819
5 green.

17:19.300 --> 17:20.585
Got nothing.

17:20.619 --> 17:22.665
What the hell
am I looking for?

17:22.700 --> 17:25.420
Something happened
down at the harbor.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.220
Beck, are you okay?

17:29.255 --> 17:31.105
theo... He's alive.

17:31.140 --> 17:32.900
They've done something
to him.

17:32.935 --> 17:34.660
What are you
talking about?

17:34.695 --> 17:35.785
What did you see?

17:35.820 --> 17:38.585
The only thing I saw...

17:38.620 --> 17:41.380
Was a different man
where my husband used to be.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.780
So what are we
talking about here,

17:45.815 --> 17:48.100
Uh, time travel?

17:49.380 --> 17:50.660
I don't really think
we're talking about anything.

17:53.220 --> 17:56.660
There's a fine line
between coincidence

17:56.695 --> 17:57.945
And conspiracy.

17:57.980 --> 18:00.945
Now I've shown you mine.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.500
I think it's time
you show me yours.

18:03.535 --> 18:05.177
Yeah, you know,
as journalists,

18:05.212 --> 18:06.820
We're not so much
with the showing.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.580
Have you ever heard of
verscharfte vernehmung?

18:11.615 --> 18:15.057
It's german for
"enhanced interrogation."

18:15.092 --> 18:18.500
A form of torture
that would leave no marks,

18:18.535 --> 18:21.237
And hence save nazi officers

18:21.272 --> 18:23.905
From suspicion of impropriety.

18:23.940 --> 18:26.700
Not that I would endorse
such behavior.

18:26.735 --> 18:29.460
Certainly not in front
of all these...

18:29.495 --> 18:32.780
Young,
very observant people.

18:32.815 --> 18:35.585
What are you hiding?

18:35.620 --> 18:37.380
Mr. Blanks, we appreciate
you coming by.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.825
Know that next time we meet,

18:41.860 --> 18:44.660
I will seek payment
for my services,

18:44.695 --> 18:47.020
One way or another.

19:17.580 --> 19:20.340
Where did you get
these numbers?

19:20.375 --> 19:22.477
I was trying
to find a pattern

19:22.512 --> 19:24.580
Inside
our little friend here.

19:24.615 --> 19:26.265
I counted the veins, but-

19:26.300 --> 19:27.380
These are
the most crucial numbers

19:27.415 --> 19:28.825
In christian numerology.

19:28.860 --> 19:32.065
3 is the number
of nails on the cross.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.400
5 is the number of wounds
christ sustained.

19:35.435 --> 19:38.700
72 is the number
of thorns in the crown.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.580
The design in here
is a passionflower.

19:43.615 --> 19:46.105
A passionflower?

19:46.140 --> 19:48.560
A plant with 3 stigma,
5 anthers,

19:48.595 --> 19:50.945
72 radial filaments,
and 10 petals.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.540
The shepherds taught us
it grew out of the ground

19:52.575 --> 19:54.797
In the exact place
christ was crucified,

19:54.832 --> 19:57.020
Which was impossible,
because passionflowers

19:57.055 --> 19:59.900
Didn't grow in that part
of the world.

19:59.935 --> 20:02.540
It was a miracle.

20:04.740 --> 20:05.860
Hopefully,
this is another one.

20:05.895 --> 20:07.157
Arron, you have
a location for me?

20:07.192 --> 20:08.366
We got a lot more
than that, hank.

20:08.401 --> 20:09.540
Apparently, you're not
the only one

20:09.575 --> 20:10.785
With a history twin.

20:10.820 --> 20:13.460
Your buddy vincent,
he's got one, too.

20:13.495 --> 20:15.065
Wait. What?

20:15.100 --> 20:16.340
I don't know how,
but the commandant

20:16.375 --> 20:17.797
Of sturm's sub, he's a-

20:17.832 --> 20:19.185
He's a dead ringer for him.

20:19.220 --> 20:21.305
What the hell
is going on here?

20:21.340 --> 20:23.780
I was hoping
you could tell me because...

20:23.815 --> 20:25.185
You, vincent, the cross...

20:25.220 --> 20:28.000
I mean, history is
literally repeating itself.

20:28.035 --> 20:30.780
Now sturm and that guy
were at sea for a year

20:30.815 --> 20:32.545
Leading up to 1938,

20:32.580 --> 20:35.340
Supposedly doing some kind
of naval surveys in the north

20:35.375 --> 20:37.460
Along the coastlines of ireland,
the orkneys,

20:37.495 --> 20:39.817
And, get this,
the faroe islands,

20:39.852 --> 20:42.105
Where they did extensive
land surveys

20:42.140 --> 20:44.000
Of the northernmost tip
of the main island.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.860
They were calling it
scouts for locations

20:45.895 --> 20:47.065
To hide naval bases.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.745
Yeah.
Probably hiding something else.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.940
Listen, e-mail me the surveys
as soon as you can.

20:52.975 --> 20:54.865
I can't talk to you.

20:54.900 --> 20:57.500
I answered only to tell you
to stop.

20:57.535 --> 20:59.265
We're going after the cross.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.300
I swear to you that the pyrates
will never get it.

21:02.335 --> 21:05.537
Because you intend
to destroy it?

21:05.572 --> 21:08.676
If it averts the end times,
yes.

21:08.711 --> 21:11.145
If it keeps hank alive,
yes.

21:11.180 --> 21:13.580
I'm not afraid of you,
father.

21:13.615 --> 21:14.700
And why should you be?

21:14.735 --> 21:16.665
I'm just a man.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.820
God is the one
you should fear.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.000
I didn't ask for this.

21:24.035 --> 21:26.465
Neither did judas,

21:26.500 --> 21:30.020
And we all know how history
has portrayed him.

21:30.055 --> 21:32.220
Don't do this to me,
father.

21:32.255 --> 21:33.665
Please.

21:33.700 --> 21:36.500
You know what must be done.

21:36.535 --> 21:39.057
Serve god...

21:39.092 --> 21:41.580
Not man.

21:57.170 --> 21:58.575
You all right?

21:58.610 --> 22:00.370
Yeah, just needed some air.

22:00.405 --> 22:03.175
how are we doing?

22:03.210 --> 22:06.570
Heading out.
North end of the island.

22:06.605 --> 22:07.847
What's there?

22:07.882 --> 22:09.055
I don't know.

22:09.090 --> 22:11.890
We gotta follow these maps
that arron sent us.

22:11.925 --> 22:14.530
Maybe something
marking the ground.

22:14.565 --> 22:16.127
A passionflower?

22:16.162 --> 22:17.655
Not this far north.

22:17.690 --> 22:19.255
They can't grow
in this climate.

22:19.290 --> 22:21.250
You saying you don't
believe in miracles?

22:21.285 --> 22:23.175
I'm saying that I was married
to a man

22:23.210 --> 22:27.410
Who knew a whole lot more
about plants than any of us.

22:27.445 --> 22:29.970
And that must be
why they needed him.

22:30.005 --> 22:30.810
I'm going with you.

22:30.845 --> 22:32.055
Beck...

22:32.090 --> 22:34.410
Vincent's going to
the same place you are, right?

22:34.445 --> 22:35.495
Seems like it.

22:35.530 --> 22:37.530
Well, why don't we
get there first?

22:37.565 --> 22:39.530
And this time,
I'll be ready for him.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.895
By this holy water,

22:53.930 --> 22:57.615
And by your precious blood,

22:57.650 --> 23:00.650
Wash away all my sins,
oh, lord.

23:11.130 --> 23:14.630
You know what st. Teresa
of avila said?

23:14.665 --> 23:18.095
"from my long experience,
I've learned

23:18.130 --> 23:22.610
There's nothing like holy water
to put devils to flight."

23:22.645 --> 23:25.610
Unfortunately,
our devils in the faroes

23:25.645 --> 23:27.655
Are still on the ground.

23:27.690 --> 23:30.290
There was an exchange
of gunfire,

23:30.325 --> 23:31.375
Bringing a lot of...

23:31.410 --> 23:33.330
Unwanted attention
to the ship.

23:33.365 --> 23:37.775
Can't have that, can we?

23:37.810 --> 23:39.730
Perhaps in
our good christian reticence,

23:39.765 --> 23:42.090
We've been playing too...

23:42.125 --> 23:44.530
Diplomatically.

23:45.930 --> 23:48.695
Galliston's magazine
is here in new york.

23:48.730 --> 23:51.450
And I believe the two reporters
who came to see us

23:51.485 --> 23:54.290
Are there.

23:57.090 --> 23:58.895
I'll bring some men.

23:58.930 --> 24:03.410
Actually, I think it's time
I got my hands dirty, too.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.655
hello?

24:08.690 --> 24:10.450
rachel. It's hank's father.

24:10.485 --> 24:12.447
Oh. Hi, mr. Galliston.

24:12.482 --> 24:14.026
I need to speak to hank.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.535
He's not answering his cell.

24:15.570 --> 24:16.690
Do you know
where I can find him?

24:16.725 --> 24:19.215
I'm sorry. I-I don't.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.070
Look, I know
he's upset with us

24:21.105 --> 24:22.855
And I know
you're loyal to him,

24:22.890 --> 24:25.050
But I have some
very important information

24:25.085 --> 24:26.175
That he's been looking for.

24:26.210 --> 24:28.850
Well, if you want,
you can leave a message,

24:28.885 --> 24:30.255
And I'll give it to him
if he calls.

24:30.290 --> 24:32.690
Oh, rachel, hank was
right about one thing-

24:32.725 --> 24:33.970
You are a terrible liar.

24:34.005 --> 24:36.455
Mr. Galliston,

24:36.490 --> 24:38.455
What is this about?

24:38.490 --> 24:40.330
The more you know,
the more danger you'll be in.

24:40.365 --> 24:42.610
Tell him to call me.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.215
Tidal charts from 1938.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.050
The night the submarine
was here...

24:56.085 --> 24:58.575
Ultra low tide.

24:58.610 --> 25:00.370
This bay would have been
the only place deep enough

25:00.405 --> 25:02.410
With realistic access
to the shoreline

25:02.445 --> 25:03.730
To bury the cross.

25:05.210 --> 25:07.290
Then this is it.

25:27.170 --> 25:28.375
on the map here...

25:28.410 --> 25:30.415
<i>There's "passionblomst kapel"?</i>

25:30.450 --> 25:32.930
What does that mean,
peace corps girl?

25:32.965 --> 25:34.095
Well, there's one way

25:34.130 --> 25:36.890
A passionflower
could survive out here,

25:36.925 --> 25:39.650
And that's if
it isn't a flower at all.

25:39.685 --> 25:43.050
Passionflower chapel
is a church.

25:45.770 --> 25:48.050
You mind me asking you
a personal question, beck?

25:49.330 --> 25:50.735
We're all friends here.

25:50.770 --> 25:52.810
Well, I mean, as much
as a bunch of people

25:52.845 --> 25:55.295
Who don't trust each other
can be.

25:55.330 --> 25:57.410
You've been along
for the ride this whole time.

25:57.445 --> 25:59.490
But, you know,
you've never once talked about

25:59.525 --> 26:01.930
What you think's going on...

26:01.965 --> 26:03.975
What you believe.

26:04.010 --> 26:06.970
I mean, do you support
what we're doing?

26:07.005 --> 26:09.455
Do you fear it?

26:09.490 --> 26:11.335
I fear this weather.

26:11.370 --> 26:14.250
If you don't want to answer
the question, fine. I get it.

26:14.285 --> 26:15.855
No, I'll answer
the question

26:15.890 --> 26:18.650
As soon as I figure out
what you're trying to find out.

26:18.685 --> 26:20.947
You worried about
whose side I'm on?

26:20.982 --> 26:23.175
No, I'm not worried
about anything.

26:23.210 --> 26:26.130
<i>I'm just curious
why you're not curious.</i>

26:26.165 --> 26:28.735
I don't share my opinion

26:28.770 --> 26:30.935
Because it really
doesn't matter.

26:30.970 --> 26:33.670
I know what I believe,
I know my faith,

26:33.705 --> 26:36.370
And I also know
that I have no business

26:36.405 --> 26:38.810
In trying to sell it
to anybody.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.370
Hank!

27:00.470 --> 27:02.150
Hey, ray, you know
there's two massive storms

27:02.185 --> 27:04.550
Colliding over the faroes
as we speak?

27:04.585 --> 27:08.275
You don't think
that there's...

27:08.310 --> 27:10.790
Someone trying
to tell us something?

27:10.825 --> 27:12.075
Yeah. Me.

27:12.110 --> 27:18.310
Does that mean you're no longer
taking visitors?

27:18.345 --> 27:19.715
Ms. Lynch.

27:19.750 --> 27:21.635
Our interview last week-

27:21.670 --> 27:23.750
I was intrigued
why you didn't follow up.

27:23.785 --> 27:26.567
Um, well, uh,
you were expansive.

27:26.602 --> 27:29.315
We didn't need
anything else.

27:29.350 --> 27:32.350
Uh, if you guys don't mind,
we are closed, so...

27:32.385 --> 27:33.795
Bigfoot.

27:33.830 --> 27:35.475
The loch ness monster.

27:35.510 --> 27:40.910
Does "modern skeptic" group
the bible in that same category,

27:40.945 --> 27:43.487
Wild yarns
that can't be substantiated?

27:43.522 --> 27:46.030
Our policy is just to keep
an open mind

27:46.065 --> 27:48.047
And always look for proof.

27:48.082 --> 27:49.995
And what is proof to you?

27:50.030 --> 27:52.610
Is a footprint proof
someone larger

27:52.645 --> 27:55.155
And more powerful
than you exists?

27:55.190 --> 27:58.110
I'm not sure how
you want us to respond to that.

27:58.145 --> 28:01.030
Is that why your boss
is in the faroe islands...

28:01.065 --> 28:03.527
looking for proof?

28:03.562 --> 28:05.955
mr. Galliston...

28:05.990 --> 28:09.350
I thought it would be better
if we talked in person.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.550
Melanie.

28:14.990 --> 28:17.350
You don't remember me,
do you?

28:18.710 --> 28:22.670
Of course not.
You were just a young girl.

28:26.630 --> 28:29.315
James.

28:29.350 --> 28:31.875
After all these years.

28:31.910 --> 28:34.830
We all believed
that you were dead,

28:34.865 --> 28:37.750
And yet... Here you are,
resurrected.

28:39.110 --> 28:42.475
The lord works
in mysterious ways.

28:42.510 --> 28:47.710
But it's not the lord's work
that you need right now.

28:47.745 --> 28:49.070
It's mine.

28:54.430 --> 28:56.390
I can't go on, sir!

28:56.425 --> 28:58.067
Not now, man!

28:58.102 --> 28:59.710
We're too close.

29:04.550 --> 29:07.550
Get out
the ground-penetrating radar.

29:17.510 --> 29:19.395
You murdered me

29:19.430 --> 29:23.030
<i>So you alone could choose
where to bury the cross.</i>

29:23.065 --> 29:26.630
<i>I will unearth the secret
you held so dear</i>

29:26.665 --> 29:31.270
<i>And bury you in its place.</i>

30:21.510 --> 30:22.790
Hank.

30:29.830 --> 30:31.275
What if...

30:31.310 --> 30:35.035
What if this...

30:35.070 --> 30:37.030
What if this is the end?

30:38.550 --> 30:41.955
It could be a beginning.

30:41.990 --> 30:44.630
We can't live our lives
in fear, laila.

30:44.665 --> 30:46.387
How can you not fear?

30:46.422 --> 30:48.075
What if all of this-

30:48.110 --> 30:49.635
The weather,
that-that sign out there-

30:49.670 --> 30:53.230
What if all of this
is just him telling us to stop?

30:53.265 --> 30:54.470
What happened
out there on the road-

30:54.505 --> 30:55.847
That was a sign.

30:55.882 --> 30:57.155
A literal sign-

30:57.190 --> 30:59.550
Made of metal,
torn off by the wind.

30:59.585 --> 31:01.110
how do you know that?

31:06.310 --> 31:08.830
I don't think
this is the place.

31:08.865 --> 31:11.075
You don't?

31:11.110 --> 31:13.030
Then explain this.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.470
"true cross."

31:35.630 --> 31:38.310
You think they've been here?

31:38.345 --> 31:39.470
You tell me.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.315
No tire tracks.

31:42.350 --> 31:45.190
Door doesn't look like
it's been opened in a while.

31:45.225 --> 31:48.567
Either we're still
ahead of them...

31:48.602 --> 31:51.910
Or we're looking
in the wrong place.

32:09.230 --> 32:11.030
I don't think so.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.035
Mr. Vincent!

32:33.070 --> 32:35.150
I think we got something!

32:37.030 --> 32:39.910
Now you said,
according to the manuscript...

32:39.945 --> 32:41.275
It was in a crate

32:41.310 --> 32:43.670
Twice as long
as it was high.

32:43.705 --> 32:45.315
If I'm not mistaken,

32:45.350 --> 32:48.550
You're looking
at the true cross of christ.

32:56.610 --> 32:59.815
Pious men
designed this plan.

32:59.850 --> 33:02.850
They wanted us
to get to this moment.

33:05.090 --> 33:06.810
Here we go.

33:22.050 --> 33:24.930
Guess it's time to see the world
the way he did.

33:42.050 --> 33:44.135
The soil's almost frozen.

33:44.170 --> 33:46.530
Perhaps that's why
he chose this location-

33:46.565 --> 33:47.930
The permafrost.

33:50.370 --> 33:52.010
Would be a way
to preserve it.

33:57.050 --> 33:59.810
We're gonna need
more than one.

33:59.845 --> 34:01.410
Sure.

34:17.250 --> 34:19.610
Is that...

34:28.250 --> 34:30.090
Let's find the edges.

35:07.970 --> 35:09.655
<i>"cor fidelis"?</i>

35:09.690 --> 35:11.650
<i>It was supposed to be
"crux fidelis."</i>

35:11.685 --> 35:14.095
True cross.

35:14.130 --> 35:16.610
<i>"c. Fidelis" didn't mean
"true cross."</i>

35:16.645 --> 35:19.535
It meant "true heart."

35:19.570 --> 35:22.630
<i>"here lies
the noblest companion</i>

35:22.665 --> 35:25.655
<i>"a man could ever have.</i>

35:25.690 --> 35:29.535
<i>"a man nobler than me,</i>

35:29.570 --> 35:32.970
<i>"that deserves more
than what this earth</i>

35:33.005 --> 35:36.335
<i>"and misguided people
did to him.</i>

35:36.370 --> 35:39.330
<i>May he be in the kingdom
of god forever more."</i>

35:40.650 --> 35:44.450
<i>"I would sacrifice
my own soul to make it so."</i>

35:47.370 --> 35:49.255
<i>"may he rest here</i>

35:49.290 --> 35:52.970
<i>In the mariner's grave
he always coveted"...</i>

35:56.770 --> 36:01.215
<i>"in this high perch
over the sea...</i>

36:01.250 --> 36:05.570
<i>And be in the palm
of god's hand for eternity."</i>

36:12.010 --> 36:14.090
Got the hammer?

36:58.130 --> 37:01.090
It's a sign.

37:01.125 --> 37:04.170
Hank.

37:05.250 --> 37:06.930
Don't do this.

37:09.570 --> 37:12.770
You ready?

37:39.730 --> 37:42.650
It must have rotted
over time.

37:42.685 --> 37:45.010
The bugs got to it.

37:45.045 --> 37:46.850
nobody move!

37:50.130 --> 37:51.215
Theo!

37:51.250 --> 37:54.175
Unh-unh, lady!
You do not talk to him!

37:54.210 --> 37:56.890
Hold on. It's over. Its over.
There's nothing there.

38:01.650 --> 38:04.370
It's far from over.

38:04.405 --> 38:07.090
Bring up the bugs.

38:09.450 --> 38:10.930
Now.
