I'm telling you, Clover,

00:42.125 --> 00:43.752
you've got my parents all wrong.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.672
They're really into
this whole parenting thing.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.257
Really? Have they correctly remembered
your name yet?

00:49.341 --> 00:51.385
Stop it! You're harshing my chi's!

00:51.468 --> 00:53.679
[screaming]

00:54.054 --> 00:57.057
Get behind me. It could be someone here
to hurt you, King Julien.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.058
What?

00:58.642 --> 01:01.186
No one hurts my King Julien! Attack!

01:01.269 --> 01:03.313
Mort, no! It's too dangerous!

01:03.397 --> 01:04.648
Let's not be hasty.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.358
Do what you need to do, buddy.

That's a-- [coughs] Smell. Wow.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.956
[both retching]

01:21.040 --> 01:21.957
[both] Oh, wow.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.710
I think I'm going to be sick! [gulps]

01:24.793 --> 01:26.628
Not on the royal floor, you're not!

01:26.712 --> 01:27.963

[Clover] Okay, little whatever you are,

01:43.228 --> 01:45.230
you are trespassing on royal property,

01:45.313 --> 01:47.315
which is punishable by a little hi-yah!

01:47.399 --> 01:48.776
And some... [shrieks]

01:48.859 --> 01:50.986
-With an extra helping of cha-cha!

01:51.070 --> 01:53.154

Ever! [exclaims]

02:19.347 --> 02:21.100
Are we interrupting something?

02:21.182 --> 02:24.185
Looks like
a corporate Christmas party in here.

02:24.311 --> 02:28.231
Mommy! Daddy! There you are. [laughing]

02:28.315 --> 02:29.608
Heh, he, ha, ha!

02:29.691 --> 02:31.068
[grunts]

02:32.111 --> 02:34.529
Your Majesties, stay back.
There's an intruder.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.491
Oh, boo! You've spoiled the surprise.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.408
[both] Surprise?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.119
Wait, you know "it"?

02:40.201 --> 02:42.746
Of course,
you poor objectionable creature.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.832
"It" is Julien's brother.

02:44.915 --> 02:45.791
Eh...

02:45.874 --> 02:46.917
My who, what now?

02:47.001 --> 02:51.046
Sweetheart, don't you remember
our conversation in the family bed?

02:51.130 --> 02:52.756
I want a little brother!

02:52.840 --> 02:54.341
I want a little brother!

02:54.424 --> 02:55.884
Me, me, me! Want, want, want!

02:55.968 --> 02:57.427
I'm running away!

02:58.553 --> 02:59.387
Uh!

03:00.472 --> 03:03.684
Mark, the king has run away.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.770
Good doggy just wants a bone. [stammering]

03:06.854 --> 03:10.732
Huh? It wasn't a dream?
This is really happening? [screams]

03:10.816 --> 03:13.192
Yes, I do remember that now.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.945
Are you telling me...

03:15.362 --> 03:17.572
I have a brother?

03:17.656 --> 03:19.033
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

03:19.116 --> 03:22.577
You can't just ask for a brother
and then get one the next day.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.830
Uh, hello, baby patch, Clover.

03:24.913 --> 03:28.375
No, darling, we bought him on sale.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.960
He's an aye-aye.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.419
They're part vermin.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.754
Isn't that adorable?

03:32.838 --> 03:35.966
Apparently, their nests
are constantly raided by foosa

03:36.050 --> 03:37.843
so you can always pick them up cheap,

03:37.926 --> 03:39.720
in case you want a sister too.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.304
Snap! There it is.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.182
Totally not weird explanation.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.851
So, brother...

03:45.934 --> 03:47.019
You got a name?

03:47.102 --> 03:48.645
Uh-huh. It... It is Brodney.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.981
Rodney! I love that name!

03:51.065 --> 03:53.441
That is so a name my brother would have.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.820
No, it's not Rodney. It's-It's Brodney.

03:56.904 --> 04:00.574
Eh...
Pretty sure it's pronounced "Rodney."

04:00.657 --> 04:03.160
No. It is... It's Brodney. [stammering]

04:03.243 --> 04:05.537
"B" plus the sound "Rodney".

04:06.788 --> 04:07.956
Brodney.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.668
Pretty sure. Huh?

04:11.752 --> 04:14.088
King Julien,
we don't know anything about him.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.506
Except that he...
Oh. Not aga-- Oh...

04:16.590 --> 04:17.632
[whispers] Smells.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.593
It doesn't matter, Clover.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.429
My parents have gifted me a brother.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.849
And if there's one thing I know
above all others, it's this.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.017
I love gifts!

04:27.101 --> 04:28.018
I do!

04:28.102 --> 04:29.310
I love them.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.105
Thank you, Mommy.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.440
Thank you, Daddy. [exclaims]

04:33.607 --> 04:38.237
-It finally feels like a real family.
-[Brodney whimpering]

04:38.319 --> 04:41.240
So, Brodney, tell me about your kingdom.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.325
Um... It's a sulfur bog that, you know,

04:44.409 --> 04:47.704
is pretty much on fire year round.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.791
Um... Sounds shteamy. [chuckles]

04:50.874 --> 04:53.961
Bet you and your friends
have had some  hot  times.

04:54.044 --> 04:54.962
[laughs]

04:55.045 --> 04:58.173
Uh, yeah, I don't really have any friends.

04:58.257 --> 05:01.135
Everyone who isn't on fire

05:01.218 --> 05:03.762
pretty much avoids me.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.307
Well, who needs friends
when you've got me, Brother?

05:07.557 --> 05:08.809
Good, you're here.

05:09.726 --> 05:13.105
I want my sleeping quarters
totally hauled over.

05:13.188 --> 05:16.817
This is a brother room now, which means...

05:17.317 --> 05:19.987
pillow fights, chair forts,
and lots of wrestling.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.446
How did this happen?

05:21.529 --> 05:23.323
You were watching his parents.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.741
All I do is watch them!

05:24.825 --> 05:27.244
They're always ringing that bell
like demented inf--

05:27.327 --> 05:28.620
Did you hear that? Was that a bell?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.330
I'm coming, Your Majesties!

05:30.413 --> 05:31.873
[screams and crashes]

05:31.957 --> 05:35.877
It's always the ones who seem so strong
that break the quickest, eh?

05:35.961 --> 05:37.212
[Julien laughing]

05:37.296 --> 05:39.338
Let's start, peoples.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.967
Ted, you have a degree in interior design.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.260
I do not, sir.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.886
Excellent. Pitch me your take.

05:44.970 --> 05:48.682
Well, I think brothers and bunk beds
always go well together.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.434
Hm... Amazing!

05:51.852 --> 05:53.103
I call top bunk.

05:53.478 --> 05:57.316
Now, time to teach you how brothers roll.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.193
[sniffles]

05:59.276 --> 06:00.819
[dance music playing]

06:01.236 --> 06:02.196
[Julien] Aha-ha!

06:02.279 --> 06:05.866
First thing you gotta know
is that your big brother, King Julien,

06:05.949 --> 06:07.826
-is all about the booty.
-[crowd cheering]

06:07.909 --> 06:08.785
Check it.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.787
Your booty is your power, Brother.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.873
[grunts] And when you roll with me,

06:12.956 --> 06:15.500
that booty's got to... [humming]

06:15.583 --> 06:17.085
Roar!

06:17.961 --> 06:19.004
You try.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.673
[flinching]

06:21.756 --> 06:24.134
[crowd chanting]
Brodney! Brodney! Brodney!

06:24.592 --> 06:26.011
[screaming]

06:27.804 --> 06:28.930
[explodes]

06:29.848 --> 06:31.058
Huh?

06:31.850 --> 06:34.561
Ha! That's right, you losers better run,

06:34.644 --> 06:37.564
'cause the brothers are in the house.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.817
Way to clear that dance floor
like a boss, Brodney.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.028
I think I pulled a hammy.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.571
[groans]

06:46.240 --> 06:50.451
[Mort]  King Julien never congratulates me
when I spray my musk.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.288
Besides being eaten by foosa,

06:53.372 --> 06:56.457
a lemur's second greatest skill
is tramping.

06:56.541 --> 07:00.670
My kingdom boasts some of the greatest
artisan trampers around.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.298
-Give it a shot, Brother.
-Eh, eh...

07:03.382 --> 07:06.385
Come on,
you gotta get the full experience.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.426
[Brodney] I'm not...

07:08.887 --> 07:10.389
[screaming]

07:10.471 --> 07:11.973
[explodes]

07:13.600 --> 07:15.060
[Brodney groaning]

07:15.143 --> 07:16.811
[whooping]

07:16.895 --> 07:18.813
You were awesome!

07:18.897 --> 07:22.150
[groans] I think my legs are shattered.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.195
Eh, rub some dirt on 'em, you'll be fine.

07:26.529 --> 07:30.491
[Mort]  King Julien never rubs dirt on me
when my body is broken.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.245
[Julien] Please.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.163
What's the matter, Brother?

07:35.247 --> 07:36.915
Don't you like the lemur ladies?

07:36.998 --> 07:38.833
[giggling]

07:38.917 --> 07:42.087
Uh, I don't really like being wet.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.048
Oh, come on, it's a Jacuzzi, man.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.300
They're fierce.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.676
-Rawr!
-[giggling]

07:48.760 --> 07:49.970
[snarling]

07:52.847 --> 07:54.474
[screaming]

07:55.183 --> 07:56.017
Move!

07:56.101 --> 07:58.437
-I'm out of here.
-[laughing]

07:58.937 --> 08:01.940
I think I swallowed my tongue. [chokes]

08:02.023 --> 08:03.442
Oh, you've got another one.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.860
Did you see the way those ladies reacted

08:05.986 --> 08:08.029
to the way you got your freak on?

08:08.113 --> 08:09.239
They love you, man.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.407
So gangster!

08:12.784 --> 08:16.913
[Mort]  King Julien never calls me gangster
when I freak ladies out.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.669
[sighs]

08:22.752 --> 08:25.005
That was a great day.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.008
Just how I always pictured my life
with a brother.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.843
Lots of screaming and pain.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.594
The stuff family is made of.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.347
[Brodney] I wanna go home.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.556
[laughs] Good one, Brother.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.184
You... You're kidding, right?

08:37.267 --> 08:39.227
When your parents bought me,

08:39.311 --> 08:41.229
I thought it would be different.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.232
That I'd finally be accepted somewhere.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.443
But I'm still a loser.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.652
Hey, hey, stop it.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.695
You are not a loser.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.572
Yes, you have all the characteristics
of a loser,

08:51.656 --> 08:53.367
but now that you are royal,

08:53.450 --> 08:55.076
people have to ignore that.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.328
It's like a law or something.

08:56.411 --> 08:59.039
Yeah, but that's the problem.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.499
I'm not a royal.

09:00.581 --> 09:03.502
Oh, oh. And everyone knows it.

09:03.584 --> 09:04.585
[sighing]

09:06.171 --> 09:07.339
Thank you for coming.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.091
This is a very serious matter,

09:10.509 --> 09:11.510
and I want--

09:11.592 --> 09:12.927
Maurice, what are you doing?

09:13.011 --> 09:15.013
Oh, he's eating our nits.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.057
The kingdom is simply infested.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.642
King's advisor to nit gobbler. [munching]

09:19.726 --> 09:22.312
Rather throw myself
in the mouth of a foosa.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.189
-All eating is on hold!
-[retches]

09:24.272 --> 09:25.357
This is important.

09:25.440 --> 09:29.319
Now, who here thinks Brodney is a loser?

09:29.444 --> 09:30.945
[stammering]

09:32.447 --> 09:33.448
Oh, oh, oh!

09:33.532 --> 09:34.699
Really? Wait.

09:34.782 --> 09:35.825
Mom, Dad?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.160
You didn't raise your hand.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.663
Sorry, dear, were we supposed to be
paying attention?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.707
Hey, I think I speak for everyone

09:42.790 --> 09:45.001
when I say this dork has gotta go!

09:45.085 --> 09:46.920
-Ow!
-No! He's my little brother

09:47.003 --> 09:48.547
and, well, he's mine.

09:48.629 --> 09:49.923
And I want him to be royal.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.426
Your Majesty, you can't just
make someone royal.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.052
-[Maurice spits]
-Can you?

09:54.719 --> 09:55.887
I know a way.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.973
Maurice, what are we looking for?

09:59.057 --> 10:02.352
Over the years, as various laws
were made by the Julien Kings,

10:02.436 --> 10:04.104
they were written down in these books.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.064
If there is a way to make Brodney royal,

10:06.147 --> 10:07.482
we'll find it here.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.609
Then work those stumpy fingers, peoples,

10:09.692 --> 10:10.902
-we're in crisis mode.
-Huh? [grunts]

10:13.447 --> 10:15.365
Uncle King Julien
sure had a lot of enemies

10:15.449 --> 10:17.158
who mysteriously fell prey

10:17.242 --> 10:19.660
to something called
"the pit of ultimate suckage."

10:19.744 --> 10:22.372
Yes. Uncle did love his pits.

10:22.581 --> 10:23.706
Look at this.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.210
On rare occasions, when two lemurs
wish to become brothers,

10:27.294 --> 10:30.338
they can take part in something called
a brother marriage

10:30.422 --> 10:31.881
or "brarriage."

10:31.965 --> 10:34.384
Oh, that sounds so progressive.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.595
So, if King Julien brarries Brodney,

10:36.677 --> 10:39.097
Brodney will officially become
his brother by blood.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.974
And since His Majesty's blood is royal...

10:41.057 --> 10:43.143
Brodney's becomes royal as well.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.978
[scoffs] Keep tryin', Maurice,

10:45.061 --> 10:46.605
'cause there's no way

10:46.687 --> 10:50.358
my King Julien is brarrying that dork.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.903
I now pronounce you brother and brother.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.072
You may... You know what,
I'm not really sure.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.824
-[laughing]
-[crowd cheering]

10:59.159 --> 11:02.870
You both have some final documents to sign
to make your brarriage official.

11:02.954 --> 11:06.458
I can't believe this is real. [laughs]

11:06.541 --> 11:09.836
I'm roy... alty.

11:11.796 --> 11:12.631
[slurping]

11:12.713 --> 11:14.341
There, you are officially--

11:15.049 --> 11:18.178
Um, Brodney,
is this your correct birthday?

11:18.637 --> 11:19.638
Uh-huh.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.849
And Your Majesty,
your birthday date is correct?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.225
Yeah, sure, who keeps score?

11:24.351 --> 11:25.310
What's wrong?

11:25.393 --> 11:28.813
According to this,
Brodney was born before the king.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.440
He's not a little brother,

11:30.524 --> 11:31.732
he's a big brother.

11:31.816 --> 11:32.651
Great!

11:32.733 --> 11:35.362
Does that mean I get to wear
Brodney's clothes when I grow up?

11:35.445 --> 11:36.904
King Julien, you don't understand.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.407
If Brodney is older, according to law,

11:39.491 --> 11:40.741
he's now the king.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.410
-Hm?
-Oh!

11:42.701 --> 11:43.786
Oh...

11:43.870 --> 11:45.205
[dully] Oh...

11:45.288 --> 11:48.916
I said I wanted a little brother.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.461
Do you even know how old I am?

11:51.545 --> 11:52.920
Is that something we should know?

11:53.004 --> 11:55.173
Oh, so many rules to this...

11:55.756 --> 11:56.841
Parenting!

11:56.924 --> 11:58.343
It's called parenting!

11:58.885 --> 12:01.804
Uh... I don't even want to be king.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.641
Responsibility, it makes me...

12:04.765 --> 12:06.560
[stammering] Uh-oh.

12:06.643 --> 12:07.852
Whoa, whoa!

12:07.935 --> 12:09.229
[everyone screaming]

12:09.312 --> 12:11.105
It's okay, buddy.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.607
We're gonna figure this out.

12:12.691 --> 12:15.151
I just want to be brothers. Oh!

12:15.235 --> 12:17.111
Can't I turn it down?

12:17.195 --> 12:20.323
[gasps] Yes! Brodney can abdicate,
Your Majesty. Quit!

12:20.407 --> 12:21.949
Just like Uncle King Julien did?

12:22.033 --> 12:22.909
It's perfect!

12:22.992 --> 12:24.285
Except it won't work.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.705
We outlawed being able
to give up the crown.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.290
What? Why would we do something so stupid?

12:29.708 --> 12:31.084
I am all in.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.419
Eh, it's just a vacation.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.045
A few months or six.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.380
You're in good hands.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.257
Get a colored pencil, Maurice.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.966
I've got some ideas.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.009
Eh...

12:40.093 --> 12:41.886
What if he married a commoner?

12:41.969 --> 12:42.803
A what-ener?

12:42.887 --> 12:45.806
Someone of poor quality and mongrel blood,

12:45.890 --> 12:47.016
like Clover.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.351
Argh!

12:50.144 --> 12:51.938
So, if I married Clover--

12:52.021 --> 12:52.855
[Clover] Not gonna happen.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.858
Or someone else with bad blood...

12:55.942 --> 12:58.445
Ah-- I can't be king?

12:58.528 --> 13:01.989
A royal must marry royalty
or they can't ascend the throne.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.701
Your mother almost made that mistake.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.579
I was young and fell in love
with a gibbon.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.372
He was a wonderful dancer.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.041
When he wasn't throwing his own poo.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.419
Then what are we waiting for?

13:14.502 --> 13:16.170
Let's find you a bride!

13:17.004 --> 13:18.965
So what's this all about, Mort?

13:19.048 --> 13:21.134
Your flyer was pretty vague.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.052
"Single lemur seeks..."

13:23.136 --> 13:26.013
And then it's just a bunch of wet spots
that look like tears.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.308
I have recently lost someone.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.393
I'm searching for his replacement.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.478
Let me guess.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.479
King Julien?

13:32.562 --> 13:33.938
I see you knew him.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.065
-Well, I knew he was an idiot.
-Get out!

13:36.149 --> 13:39.611
When I saw your flyer, it was like wow!

13:40.069 --> 13:41.613
Finally someone to scream

13:41.696 --> 13:43.448
"we're all gonna die" with.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.783
[excitedly] Oh, oh, oh!

13:44.865 --> 13:45.908
Can we do it right now?

13:45.992 --> 13:46.909
Oy vey.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.244
I know what you're thinking.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.537
Why Pancho?

13:49.621 --> 13:51.080
Answer, who knows.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.749
Am I boring? Sure.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.584
Social skills? None.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.795
But I'm loyal if you feed me
and I will never leave you

13:56.877 --> 13:58.421
because, well, I need the food.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.506
Tempting.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.424
But before I make any decision,

14:01.508 --> 14:03.301
I need to see your feet.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.218
Whoa!

14:04.302 --> 14:07.221
All right. Full disclosure,
the right one's a little infected.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.390
Eh...

14:09.474 --> 14:11.476
I've never been on a date before.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.560
What do I say?

14:12.644 --> 14:16.272
I mean, do I tell them
how short my lifespan is? Oh!

14:16.439 --> 14:18.399
I've never touched a female.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.151
Do I draw blood first?

14:20.234 --> 14:23.488
I mean, you know,
is it rude to ask to see their claws

14:23.571 --> 14:26.366
before we get serious? Gah!

14:26.449 --> 14:27.534
You know, Brodney,

14:27.617 --> 14:29.994
you are so amazing without words,

14:30.077 --> 14:31.830
I say, why talk?

14:31.912 --> 14:33.456
Ladies love mystery,

14:33.540 --> 14:36.042
especially when it doesn't speak.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.753
And if you get nervous,
just excuse yourself to the bathroom.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.297
Spraying your musk on a date
is a real mood killer.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.590
Trust me.

14:42.923 --> 14:46.636
Ooh, I like your hair. [giggling]

14:46.886 --> 14:48.596
You're like ugly hot.

14:48.680 --> 14:52.099
I can't wait to show you around
the club scene.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.602
-Party!
-[squealing]

14:55.353 --> 14:58.565
Ah, you're a squealer. [chuckles]

14:58.648 --> 14:59.940
I like that.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.526
Hmm...

15:01.609 --> 15:05.279
Todd has really taken a shine to you.

15:05.363 --> 15:09.784
It's usually weeks
before he'll climb up on somebody.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.745
[chuckles] Todd!

15:11.828 --> 15:14.748
Say something to the nice royal.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.791
Will you be my daddy?

15:16.875 --> 15:17.834
Whoo-hoo!

15:17.917 --> 15:20.378
I think we have a done deal here.

15:20.461 --> 15:23.047
What do you have to say
to that, Butterfish?

15:23.506 --> 15:26.885
How much longer this gonna take, baby?
I still gotta get to work.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.516
I'm a handful.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.768
[farts]

15:35.435 --> 15:36.895
[farts]

15:37.687 --> 15:39.898
[continues farting]

15:41.190 --> 15:43.276
That's it? Where's the rest?

15:43.359 --> 15:44.944
"Eaten or married."

15:45.027 --> 15:46.237
Sorry, Your Majesty.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.447
How's it going?

15:47.530 --> 15:49.616
Have you found an undesirable yet?

15:49.699 --> 15:50.700
[sighs]

15:50.784 --> 15:54.078
I thought having a brother
would finally make us a real family.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.664
Instead, I've lost everything.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.251
Enjoy the throne.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.002
-I sure did.
-Eh...

16:02.086 --> 16:03.713
Julien, please...

16:04.798 --> 16:06.382
I'm still your brother.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.760
Still friends, right?

16:08.843 --> 16:10.720
Oh, of course, Brodney.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.347
The only thing changed by you being king

16:13.431 --> 16:16.309
is my life not having meaning anymore.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.518
No biggie.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.770
[sighs]

16:20.939 --> 16:21.940
Your Majesty...

16:22.022 --> 16:23.691
-Son...
-Don't look at me!

16:23.775 --> 16:26.152
I am hideous without my crown.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.363
Everyone can see my receding fur line,

16:29.447 --> 16:31.532
which is no doubt inherited!

16:32.700 --> 16:33.868
What have we done, Barty?

16:33.952 --> 16:36.871
If only this were still the days
of your brother's reign.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.957
Back then, anything
that threatened the king

16:39.039 --> 16:41.668
had a nasty way of just disappearing.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.086
Hang on, I'm...

16:45.087 --> 16:46.255
What?

16:47.882 --> 16:48.883
-King Julien?
-Your Majesty?

16:48.967 --> 16:51.970
[Julien] There's no one here
by that title. Go away!

16:52.971 --> 16:53.930
What are you doing?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.515
The right thing.

16:55.598 --> 16:59.226
I'm supporting my brother and my family
by leaving.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.228
How is that the right thing?

17:01.312 --> 17:05.650
Please, Maurice, everyone knows
what a great king I've been.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.109
The bar is too high.

17:07.193 --> 17:10.279
Brodney will always feel inferior
if I stay.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.573
I'll be fine. Going back to my roots.

17:12.657 --> 17:13.867
The party prince.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.243
This booty has been away too long.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.788
Um, you still party all the time.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.040
[shouts]

17:21.123 --> 17:23.001
Your Majesty, are you all right?

17:23.083 --> 17:24.585
Stop calling me that.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.086
Just let me go.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.881
You're leaving?

17:28.548 --> 17:29.549
Mort? What are you...

17:29.632 --> 17:31.300
[shushing] No words.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.677
I tried to replace you,

17:32.760 --> 17:35.847
but you can't just make someone
what you want them to be.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.765
So I am leaving, too.

17:37.849 --> 17:40.393
I believe they call that "shwarma".

17:40.476 --> 17:42.979
-You're thinking of "karma", Mort.
-[Mort shushes]

17:43.062 --> 17:43.938
No words.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.481
I want to remember--

17:45.565 --> 17:46.691
Where's your crown?

17:46.774 --> 17:47.984
The king's brarriage brackfired.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.318
I mean, it backfired.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.404
Rod... Brodney's the king now. Wait, what?

17:51.487 --> 17:55.491
Turns out my younger brother
is older than he looks.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.826
We've tried to find a way--

17:56.910 --> 17:58.703
I can get you your crown back.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.246
[both] What, say what, what now?

18:00.329 --> 18:02.289
Mort, you gorgeous little imp!

18:02.373 --> 18:03.374
Tell me how!

18:03.457 --> 18:04.792
Tell me! Do it!

18:04.876 --> 18:07.837
[shouting] Come on! Right now! Tell me!

18:07.921 --> 18:12.132
[giggling] Does this mean you missed me
and want me back?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.801
-Ow!
-Don't push it.

18:13.885 --> 18:16.971
Mommy, Daddy, I have great news!

18:17.055 --> 18:18.472
Where's Brodney?

18:18.556 --> 18:19.849
He's gone, sweetheart.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.517
Come over here and have some lunch.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.978
-I think we're eating clams.
-[squeaking]

18:24.062 --> 18:26.647
Are clams able to run like that?

18:26.731 --> 18:29.442
[chuckling] I don't know.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.070
Why do you have my crown?

18:32.152 --> 18:34.447
What have you done to Brodney?

18:34.530 --> 18:36.449
Please, it was nothing barbaric.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.577
We simply handled the problem
the way your uncle would have.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.747
We had him thrown
into the pit of ultimate suckage.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.582
You're welcome.

18:44.665 --> 18:45.499
[screaming]

18:45.583 --> 18:48.210
Do they let just anyone have a baby?

18:48.294 --> 18:49.420
Isn't there a test?

18:49.503 --> 18:51.714
[Brodney screaming]

18:51.798 --> 18:52.632
Brodney!

18:52.757 --> 18:54.508
Hold on. I'm coming, Brother!

18:54.592 --> 18:56.052
[exclaiming]

18:59.013 --> 19:00.723
Brodney, where are you?

19:00.807 --> 19:04.143
Send up a stink trail or something,
so I can find-- Whoa!

19:04.226 --> 19:05.103
[screams]

19:06.854 --> 19:07.688
Hm...

19:08.439 --> 19:09.273
Huh?

19:10.733 --> 19:12.151
Brodney?

19:12.902 --> 19:15.279
Brodney, we have to get out of here.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.824
Uh-uh. I'm staying.

19:17.907 --> 19:22.369
Mom and Dad said you didn't want me
around anymore.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.371
I thought we were brothers.

19:24.956 --> 19:25.957
Friends.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.041
We are.

19:27.125 --> 19:30.753
Unfortunately, you were purchased
by really messed up parents.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.088
It's my fault.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.673
I wanted a little brother

19:33.756 --> 19:36.300
who'd look up to me
and complete my family.

19:36.383 --> 19:39.386
But you got me instead.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.681
Yeah! And I'm happy I did.

19:41.764 --> 19:44.600
You're the best older brother
I never wanted.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.144
And I don't want to lose you.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.561
-So, let's go.
-[growling]

19:47.645 --> 19:48.479
[Brodney screaming]

19:49.897 --> 19:51.482
What is that?

19:51.565 --> 19:55.903
I think it's the "suckage" part
in "the pit of ultimate suckage."

19:55.987 --> 19:57.279
Brodney-- Ow!

19:57.363 --> 19:58.405
No pressure.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.283
But I could really use
some help right now!

20:01.367 --> 20:03.577
[grunting] And there goes my liver.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.329
What do I do?

20:05.454 --> 20:07.331
I'm afraid!

20:07.414 --> 20:09.542
You're royalty, Brodney!

20:10.376 --> 20:12.378
Oof! And my brother!

20:12.461 --> 20:15.673
Ow! You have a vomit inducing musk gland!

20:16.382 --> 20:19.343
Come on, man. You've got this. Oh!

20:19.426 --> 20:21.721
-I believe in you.
-Okay.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.681
[screams and farts]

20:28.227 --> 20:29.436
[screams]

20:30.563 --> 20:31.480
[grunts]

20:32.065 --> 20:33.191
[tentacle retching]

20:40.406 --> 20:42.950
Wow. Didn't know tentacles could vomit.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.577
Learn somethin' every day.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.829
Yeah, I saved you.

20:46.913 --> 20:51.834
That's the second time
I've ever been glad to be me.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.502
Oh, what was the first?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.421
The day we got brarried.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.256
-[laughing]
-Aw.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.509
Your Majesty, there you are!

21:00.593 --> 21:02.720
Are you all right?
Your parents told us what they did.

21:02.803 --> 21:03.763
I'm fine.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.514
Thanks to my brother.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.141
Uh, did Mort come through?

21:07.225 --> 21:08.101
[Mort] Did I?

21:10.895 --> 21:13.231
A female aye-aye?

21:13.313 --> 21:16.234
That's right, buddy. [chuckling]

21:16.817 --> 21:18.611
-We're sure that's a girl, right?
-Mm-hmm.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.197
Hey, this doesn't change
anything, Brodney.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.865
We're still brothers.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.159
And if you want to remain king...

21:25.243 --> 21:27.828
Eh, the crown belongs to you.

21:27.912 --> 21:31.958
And besides, I've always imagined
myself a lover...

21:32.041 --> 21:34.085
[grunts] not a ruler.

21:34.168 --> 21:35.836
He, he, he.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.131
Hi.

21:39.215 --> 21:42.593
I'm Bronda.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.637
Oh...

21:44.720 --> 21:50.810
Is that pronounced "B"
plus the sound "Ronda"?

21:51.685 --> 21:54.105
[both screaming and farting]

21:54.396 --> 21:55.439
[both laughing]

21:55.522 --> 21:58.025
Aw. Isn't love creepy?

21:58.109 --> 22:00.236
Soon as they marry, you'll be king again.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.071
And no one had to die.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.697
Always a win in my book.

22:03.781 --> 22:06.325
Thanks Mom and Dad
for nearly getting me killed!

22:06.408 --> 22:07.493
[both] Mm-hmm.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.162
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.955
I know how badly you wanted parents

22:11.038 --> 22:13.707
that were loving, attentive,
not psychopaths.

22:13.791 --> 22:17.419
Eh... They could use some improvement.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.504
Improvement?

22:18.587 --> 22:21.299
Your Majesty, forgive me,
but they have failed.

22:21.381 --> 22:22.466
Fine.

22:22.549 --> 22:26.887
But what do you do when your parents
are the worst people you've ever met?

22:26.971 --> 22:29.598
I know a guy who could make 'em disappear.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.517
Real discrete. Ow!

22:31.600 --> 22:33.811
I am not killing my parents.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.730
But I can't live like this either.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.107
One way or the other,

22:38.191 --> 22:39.441
they have to go.
