[Moxy] We're gonna make
our dreams come true!

11:31.016 --> 11:34.351
Everything that comes
to Uglyville arrives here.

11:34.353 --> 11:36.754
So if we're going to find
the Big World,

11:36.756 --> 11:39.489
it's only logical
we start here.

11:39.491 --> 11:44.762
Okay, the Big World
and children do not exist.

11:44.764 --> 11:48.833
I just wanna have a look inside
that flower. Who's with me?

11:48.835 --> 11:49.968
[Wage] Don't do it.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.936
- I'm in!
- Me, too!

11:52.938 --> 11:54.339
- [Wage] Traitors.
- Eh?

11:58.110 --> 12:00.110
Come on. Come on over here.

12:00.112 --> 12:01.813
Hit me.

12:01.815 --> 12:04.614
- Just a quick look.
- And then we'll turn back.

12:04.616 --> 12:06.952
Yes! You guys are the ugliest.

12:07.286 --> 12:09.889
Now the only question is:
how do we get up there?

12:10.289 --> 12:12.956
- [Babo laughs]
- [Wage, Lucky Bat yelp]

12:12.958 --> 12:14.357
Hey!

12:14.359 --> 12:15.862
Whoa!

12:19.298 --> 12:21.298
Eh, I got nothing.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.033
Hmm. We need something

12:23.035 --> 12:24.902
that could grip onto the edge
nice and tight.

12:24.904 --> 12:27.406
Even then, it would still need
to hold all our weight.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.141
Huh?

12:29.675 --> 12:31.007
No, no. No.

12:31.009 --> 12:34.146
No!

12:36.415 --> 12:37.549
[grunts]

12:38.083 --> 12:42.221
[groans]
Anytime now, guys. Let's go.

12:44.690 --> 12:46.525
[gasps] Hmm.

12:48.594 --> 12:50.694
[all] Wow.

12:50.696 --> 12:53.731
[Wage]
Oh, good. A terrifying void.

12:53.733 --> 12:55.198
[Babo]
That's always a good sign.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.266
[Ugly Dog]
This is what the inside

12:56.268 --> 12:57.567
of a flower looks like?

12:57.569 --> 12:59.669
Yeah, dark and creepy.

12:59.671 --> 13:01.673
All right, that's it.
Let's go.

13:02.742 --> 13:04.942
[Babo] Anyone else going
to UglyDolls On Ice tonight?

13:04.944 --> 13:06.878
[Wage] Nah, I don't wanna miss

13:06.880 --> 13:09.849
this week's episode of
<i>Uglyville's Got No Talent.</i>

13:12.384 --> 13:14.286
Moxy?

13:15.687 --> 13:18.088
Let's just call it a day, huh?

13:18.090 --> 13:21.691
You guys,
this pipe goes somewhere.

13:21.693 --> 13:23.228
Say something to her.

13:24.196 --> 13:25.763
Um... [clears throat]

13:25.765 --> 13:30.235
Sometimes, the insides
of our dreams are hollow.

13:31.470 --> 13:34.239
- Like this pipe, for example.
- [scoffs]

13:36.408 --> 13:37.777
Hollow, huh?

13:40.045 --> 13:41.979
I guess a girl can dream.

13:41.981 --> 13:44.483
We'll just go on back
like a bunch of go-on-backers.

13:44.817 --> 13:47.150
I just gotta see
what it's like!

13:47.152 --> 13:50.122
I think we probably should
have expected her to do that.

13:51.223 --> 13:53.123
- Here we go.
- [Wage] Moxy. Moxy!

13:53.125 --> 13:54.926
Slow down. You're gonna slip.

13:54.928 --> 13:57.730
- It's dangerous!
- [panting]

14:01.166 --> 14:02.934
[Moxy] Almost there! Come on!

14:02.936 --> 14:05.738
[continues panting]

14:07.673 --> 14:09.742
Come on, guys! Come on!

14:13.478 --> 14:14.845
Um...

14:14.847 --> 14:15.982
I guess not.

14:16.615 --> 14:19.917
Guys. What if this is the way
to the Big World?

14:19.919 --> 14:22.152
But Ox says there is
no Big World and he...

14:22.154 --> 14:26.656
He didn't know there was something
else out there. But we do.

14:26.658 --> 14:30.928
This pipe? It's real,
and it has to lead somewhere.

14:30.930 --> 14:32.429
Maybe it's the Big World.

14:32.431 --> 14:35.032
If anyone can figure it out,
it's us.

14:35.034 --> 14:39.369
Lucky, what could make you wiser than
solving the ultimate unsolved mystery?

14:39.371 --> 14:41.939
Hello! Mystery ahead!

14:41.941 --> 14:43.841
And, Ugly Dog,
you're my best friend.

14:43.843 --> 14:45.542
Well, that's just hurtful.

14:45.544 --> 14:48.445
Are you really going
to let me go in alone?

14:48.447 --> 14:49.981
You ain't goin' alone.

14:49.983 --> 14:51.147
[Wage] Classic guilt trip.

14:51.149 --> 14:52.515
And when someone needs help,

14:52.517 --> 14:53.951
who y'all gonna call?

14:53.953 --> 14:56.152
Babo, that's who!

14:56.154 --> 14:58.722
I gotta say, she gets me.

14:58.724 --> 15:02.160
Hmm. I suppose a little
journey could be enlightening.

15:02.895 --> 15:04.127
This is ridiculous!

15:04.129 --> 15:05.362
Going into a creepy pipe

15:05.364 --> 15:06.864
that spells certain doom?

15:06.866 --> 15:08.966
No. No, thank you!

15:08.968 --> 15:10.400
Wage.

15:10.402 --> 15:12.202
Go ahead.
Give me your big sell, Moxy.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.804
Tell me that I have to go.

15:13.806 --> 15:15.740
It's my duty as a doll
to be a friend.

15:15.742 --> 15:18.575
Tell me that deep down I want
to know what's over there, too.

15:18.577 --> 15:20.143
Come on. Give me the pitch!

15:20.145 --> 15:21.846
If you don't come,

15:21.848 --> 15:23.246
you're going to have
to climb down that cliff

15:23.248 --> 15:25.651
all by yourself.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.186
Good pitch.

15:28.587 --> 15:31.554
Let's just let the record show
that I am against this.

15:31.556 --> 15:34.324
- [all cheer]
- Now, that's what I'm talking about, Wage.

15:34.326 --> 15:36.727
- [Babo straining]
- [Wage] Slow down, Blobby.

15:36.729 --> 15:38.865
- [Babo] It's Babo.
- [Wage] I know your name.

15:40.733 --> 15:42.699
[Moxy]
There are so many tunnels.

15:42.701 --> 15:44.501
[Ugly Dog] What
we really need is a light.

15:44.503 --> 15:46.202
[Babo] I have a flashlight!

15:46.204 --> 15:47.872
[Wage] So why have
we been walking in the dark

15:47.874 --> 15:49.506
for the last hour, then?

15:49.508 --> 15:51.174
[Babo]
I'm conserving the batteries

15:51.176 --> 15:53.144
until we really need it.

15:53.146 --> 15:55.079
[Wage] Good thinking. Let me
know when you come upon a time

15:55.081 --> 15:57.048
when you really need it.

15:57.050 --> 15:58.417
[Babo] You got it!

15:59.685 --> 16:01.451
- [sniffing]
- You smell anything?

16:01.453 --> 16:02.686
It's hard to say.

16:02.688 --> 16:05.457
It'd be easier
if I had a nose.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.925

Whoo-hoo!

25:15.908 --> 25:18.344
Come on, Moxy. Let's go home.

25:19.111 --> 25:21.513
[Babo] Do you want me
to carry you home, too?

25:23.015 --> 25:25.184
Okay, just let me know.

25:29.355 --> 25:33.624
[laughs] Bless their ugly
little hearts. Such a shame.

25:33.626 --> 25:35.294
It is kinda sad, though.

25:35.995 --> 25:39.796
Of course, "sad" in, like,
a totally, totally shameful way.

25:39.798 --> 25:40.933
Obviously.

25:59.051 --> 26:00.386
Moxy.

26:01.020 --> 26:04.021
You know what?
We're not going anywhere.

- What are you doing?

26:05.958 --> 26:07.157
Have you lost your mind?

26:07.159 --> 26:08.625
We don't belong here.

26:08.627 --> 26:10.227
We've come this far.

26:10.229 --> 26:11.962
Um... come again?

26:11.964 --> 26:14.231
We're gonna train
and go to the Big World.

26:14.233 --> 26:16.700
We're just as lovable
as any of you.

26:16.702 --> 26:19.872
And we're gonna
prove you wrong.

26:27.012 --> 26:29.848
Before we decide to do this,
shouldn't we tell Ox?

26:32.718 --> 26:34.985
Ox? Who is Ox?

26:34.987 --> 26:37.823
Well, he's the founder and mayor
of our town, where we live.

26:38.657 --> 26:43.327
So there's
a whole town of Uglies?

26:43.329 --> 26:45.564
It's called Uglyville.

26:45.898 --> 26:48.165
I guess they're
into literal naming.

26:48.167 --> 26:50.033
None of this matters. Okay?

26:50.035 --> 26:54.071
Only Pretty Dolls can run
the Gauntlet. Rules are rules.

26:54.073 --> 26:55.274

26:55.874 --> 26:58.175
- Uh...
- [robot] Did someone say "rules"?

26:58.177 --> 27:01.545
- It says right here in section 43...
- Oh! You know what? Stay here.

27:01.547 --> 27:03.213
- Seriously?
- [Lou] Yes.

27:03.215 --> 27:06.383
What kind of amazingly
benevolent leader would I be

27:06.385 --> 27:09.388
if I denied fellow dolls a
chance to fulfill their dreams?

27:09.855 --> 27:13.256
Mandy, show our special guests
their quarters.

27:13.258 --> 27:16.794
May I suggest
the Supply Suite.

27:16.796 --> 27:18.030
Sweet!

27:25.137 --> 27:29.441

get better than this.

27:35.981 --> 27:38.550
[Babo] Ha!
That's the name of our song.

27:41.954 --> 27:44.254
Find out everything you can
about their town

27:44.256 --> 27:45.956
and report back to me
tomorrow night.

27:45.958 --> 27:49.128
- Night? Like a date?
- No.

27:49.428 --> 27:53.800
But there is one more thing
I need you to do.

- Everything is so different here.
- [Wage] I'd say.

28:36.675 --> 28:40.644
[Babo] So you guys
actually live in these boxes?

28:40.646 --> 28:43.013
Not that they're bad boxes.

28:43.015 --> 28:46.483
They're all neat and organized
and straight...

28:46.485 --> 28:49.655
and symmetrical
and clean and...

28:50.355 --> 28:51.490
Whew.

28:51.858 --> 28:53.457
I'm okay.

29:02.568 --> 29:04.334
[Moxy] What is that?

29:04.336 --> 29:06.503
That would be the supply she...

29:06.505 --> 29:09.239
I mean suite.

29:09.241 --> 29:11.208

29:11.210 --> 29:12.578
[Moxy] I love it!

29:14.781 --> 29:18.048
- [Ugly Dog] Am I the only one seeing this?
- It's so industrial chic.

29:18.050 --> 29:22.552
"Industrial chic"? It's a shed.
I mean, there's boxes and a mop.

29:22.554 --> 29:25.555
Dibs on the mop
and the bucket of dirty water.

29:25.557 --> 29:28.358
- Check out my spare tire.
- It matches my other tire.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.594
- This place is perfect for us.
- Hey, hey, guys.

29:30.596 --> 29:32.028
I'm really glad
you like it and all.

29:32.030 --> 29:34.199
But I didn't get your names.

29:34.934 --> 29:36.868
- Sorry. I'm Moxy.
- Babo.

29:36.870 --> 29:38.502
- Lucky Bat.
- Wage.

29:38.504 --> 29:40.771
- Folks call me Ugly Dog.
- Because that's his name.

29:40.773 --> 29:44.174
- But those close to me call me Slick Dog.
- Which is not his name.

29:44.176 --> 29:46.443
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

29:46.445 --> 29:48.545
[exhales]

29:48.547 --> 29:51.548
So are you really here just
to train for the Big World?

29:51.550 --> 29:53.717
- Yup.
- You bet!

29:53.719 --> 29:57.087
And we're all gonna end up with
our own special kid to love.

29:57.089 --> 30:00.925
You do know that Lou is gonna
make it super hard, right?

30:00.927 --> 30:03.393
Well, I say bring it on,
Louis.

30:03.395 --> 30:04.864
He means well, of course.

30:05.765 --> 30:08.733
- Though he can be a bit judgmental.
- Ya think?

30:08.735 --> 30:11.434
Still, without
his constructive criticism,

30:11.436 --> 30:13.738
none of us
would ever get anywhere.

30:13.740 --> 30:15.238
So just stay on his good side.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.908
[grunt] Ow!

30:16.910 --> 30:19.609
Cool glasses.
I always wanted some specs.

30:19.611 --> 30:21.779
- Ooh, yeah! I feel smarter already!
- [Mandy] Excuse me!

30:21.781 --> 30:23.413
- No!
- Do I look wiser?

30:23.415 --> 30:26.251
- Oh, yeah!
- No! Please, just... Please!

30:26.485 --> 30:27.987
[all] Huh?

30:29.923 --> 30:31.323
We're sorry.

30:33.158 --> 30:34.794
Please don't say anything,
guys.

30:35.661 --> 30:37.229
Especially not to Lou.

30:37.596 --> 30:39.830
Lots of dolls
wear glasses in Uglyville.

30:39.832 --> 30:41.631
Even Five-Eyed Steve.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.768
This is
the Institute of Perfection,

30:43.770 --> 30:46.636
and Perfect Dolls
have perfect eyesight.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.574
- [grunt]
- [UglyDolls] Oh!

30:50.843 --> 30:53.412
Man, and I thought
I had issues.

30:53.846 --> 30:55.913
Do you feel
that electricity between us?

30:55.915 --> 30:57.815
Watch this.
She's gonna turn around.

30:57.817 --> 30:59.919
She's gonna turn around.

31:00.352 --> 31:03.353
She's doing the old
"don't turn around" move.

31:03.355 --> 31:06.458
Well, she didn't need glasses
to see through you.

31:09.461 --> 31:10.662
Whoa!

31:15.802 --> 31:17.034
- Hey, Mandy!

31:17.036 --> 31:18.335
Sorry.

31:18.337 --> 31:19.806
I think your glasses
look special.

31:20.105 --> 31:21.707
They make you who you are.

31:22.541 --> 31:24.107
Yeah, but...

31:41.060 --> 31:42.692

31:42.694 --> 31:44.494
Yeah, maybe someone
down there

31:44.496 --> 31:46.565
- can tell us where Uglyville is.

31:52.304 --> 31:54.306

Lowering, lowering, lowering.

31:54.673 --> 31:56.809
Creeping, creeping, creeping.

31:57.242 --> 31:58.675
Sneaking, sneaking...

31:58.677 --> 32:01.713
[Kitty] It's not sneaking
if you say it.

32:03.181 --> 32:04.316
Huh?

32:06.518 --> 32:07.653
Huh?

Go, go, go! Come on, Willard.
I got a lot of buttons riding on you.

32:42.889 --> 32:44.789
Come on!
Do it for Five-Eyed Steve!

32:44.791 --> 32:47.925
This place is definitely ugly,
that's for sure.

32:47.927 --> 32:49.426
Hey, Tuesday, jot that down.

32:49.428 --> 32:51.428
Yas! Lou's gonna be like,

32:51.430 --> 32:53.596
"You guys are
the awesome-est spies ever."

32:53.598 --> 32:56.133
And then he'll love me.

32:56.135 --> 32:59.904
And the winner is Wedgehead,
by a wedge.

32:59.906 --> 33:01.774
Thanks, Mayor Ox!

33:02.075 --> 33:03.774
[Tuesday]
Is that a bunny or something?

33:03.776 --> 33:06.643
Oh, I love bunnies.

33:06.645 --> 33:09.281
[sighs] No, that's Ox!

33:09.715 --> 33:12.118
And there he goes. Let's move!

33:14.453 --> 33:17.320
Get him into the bag, up the pipe,
and we're on our way back to Lou.

33:17.322 --> 33:20.557
- Easy-peasy. Any questions?
- Yes! As a matter of fact.

33:20.559 --> 33:23.259
- Are those my earrings?
- Yes. Any more questions?

33:23.261 --> 33:25.628
How could you take them
without asking me?

33:25.630 --> 33:27.566
It was super easy.

33:28.101 --> 33:31.938
Oh, no, no. Don't cry, Lydia.
It'll give you frown lines.

33:32.404 --> 33:34.404
Attagirl.
It's no big deal, right?

33:34.406 --> 33:36.943
I mean, it's not like
I borrowed your lip gloss.

33:37.977 --> 33:40.077
Wait, is that my lip gloss?

33:40.079 --> 33:44.481
Whoa, is that the time? Getting late.
Let's do this. Synchronize!

33:44.483 --> 33:48.020
- That's my watch!
- It is, but it looks better on me.

33:48.286 --> 33:49.321
Come on.

33:50.123 --> 33:53.760

34:08.808 --> 34:10.273
Ow!

[Ox] Oh, a little rabbit
in the sack, huh?

34:12.210 --> 34:13.344
[grunts]

34:14.147 --> 34:17.649
I'm a natural ear runner.
You'll never catch me...

[groans] Right in the buttons.

34:20.685 --> 34:23.121
- [grunts]
- [Lydia] Good thing for that random rake.

44:40.606 --> 44:41.806
- Ugh!
- Ooh!

44:41.808 --> 44:42.906
What is it?

44:42.908 --> 44:44.574
- O...
- M...

44:44.576 --> 44:45.845
Gosh.

44:50.282 --> 44:51.283
No way!

44:58.490 --> 44:59.589
[nervous laughter]

44:59.591 --> 45:01.291
What is this?

45:01.293 --> 45:02.860
Look at my bangs.

45:02.862 --> 45:04.461
- [gasps]
- Face it, doll.

45:04.463 --> 45:05.962
They look better on him.

45:05.964 --> 45:07.865
We're Pretty Dolls now.

45:07.867 --> 45:10.434
Well, you certainly are.

45:10.436 --> 45:14.004
- So you're happy for us?
- So happy.

45:14.006 --> 45:16.206
Why does he always
have to say it in that tone?

45:16.208 --> 45:19.676
- And yet so sad.
- There he goes again.

45:19.678 --> 45:21.711
You see, I'm afraid all your
hard work has been for nothing.

45:21.713 --> 45:22.880
What do you mean?

45:22.882 --> 45:24.648
No amount of makeup

45:24.650 --> 45:27.184
or fancy new clothes
or dollscaping...

45:27.186 --> 45:28.652
Excuse you?

45:28.654 --> 45:30.287
...can take away the fact
that deep down,

45:30.289 --> 45:32.322
you are UglyDolls.

45:32.324 --> 45:33.858
There's no changing that.

45:33.860 --> 45:35.726
UglyDolls can never
pass the Gauntlet.

45:35.728 --> 45:36.894
We don't believe you.

45:36.896 --> 45:38.328
You don't believe me?

45:38.330 --> 45:39.897
I suspected as much.

45:39.899 --> 45:42.735
But maybe you'll believe him.

45:43.335 --> 45:45.001
- [UglyDolls gasp]
- [Tuesday gasps]

45:45.003 --> 45:47.504
Hello? We kidnapped him.

45:47.506 --> 45:49.206
Oh, yeah.

45:49.208 --> 45:52.642
Ox? I... I don't understand.

45:52.644 --> 45:54.377
- Moxy.
- Ox. Wait.

45:54.379 --> 45:57.882
You won't believe this.
The Big World is real!

45:57.884 --> 45:59.184
I know.

45:59.551 --> 46:01.019
What?

46:02.054 --> 46:05.689
Come on, Ox. Relieve the poor
creatures of their confusion.

46:05.691 --> 46:08.024
Why don't you start
at the beginning.

46:08.026 --> 46:09.929
What's he talking about?

46:10.730 --> 46:15.534
Moxy, all I wanted to do was
protect you. But Lou's right.

46:16.335 --> 46:18.670
You're never gonna get
to the Big World.

46:19.605 --> 46:21.573
<i>Let me try to explain.</i>

46:22.341 --> 46:25.277
<i>It all began
in the Doll Factory.</i>

46:26.378 --> 46:29.883
<i>I don't know how,
but I ended up here at the Institute.</i>

46:31.316 --> 46:34.518
<i>Lou welcomed me
and we became close friends.</i>

46:34.520 --> 46:38.121
<i>And after I begged and begged,
he even let me train.</i>

46:38.123 --> 46:41.260
<i>I even felt like I might
have a shot at the Big World.</i>

46:43.763 --> 46:47.765
<i>I was messing it up for the others,
and they started to turn on me.</i>

46:47.767 --> 46:49.034
<i>I was scared.</i>

46:49.769 --> 46:53.773
<i>It was only Lou who saved me
by showing me a way out.</i>

46:54.741 --> 46:56.039
<i>I wandered into the dark,</i>

46:56.041 --> 46:58.041
<i>and that's when I discovered</i>

46:58.043 --> 46:59.946
<i>the ugly truth
about who we are</i>

47:00.546 --> 47:01.915
<i>and where we came from.</i>

47:05.551 --> 47:09.756
<i>We UglyDolls
are nothing but rubbish.</i>

47:11.256 --> 47:15.427
<i>The humans found us unlovable
and threw us away.</i>

47:18.297 --> 47:20.297
<i>I blocked the way
to Recycling</i>

47:20.299 --> 47:23.970
<i>so that outcast dolls
would be diverted to our cove.</i>

47:25.304 --> 47:27.304
We are rejects.

47:27.306 --> 47:29.807
- [UglyDolls gasp]
- No!

47:29.809 --> 47:31.976
[Ox] We belong in Uglyville

47:31.978 --> 47:34.311
where reject dolls
can live safe

47:34.313 --> 47:36.749
and free
of anyone else's judgment.

47:37.416 --> 47:38.849
[sniffling]

47:38.851 --> 47:41.618
Oh, Moxy, look at you.

47:41.620 --> 47:44.789
This is what I've been trying
to protect you from.

47:44.791 --> 47:48.293
But I realized you'd need to
hear it from your oldest friend.

47:48.995 --> 47:51.461
You don't belong
in the Big World.

47:51.463 --> 47:53.800
You don't belong anywhere.

47:54.266 --> 47:57.202
You shouldn't even exist.

48:00.138 --> 48:03.342
Moxy,
I'm so sorry I lied.

48:04.010 --> 48:05.878
So there's
no Big World for us?

48:06.779 --> 48:08.280
No kid waiting?

48:11.350 --> 48:13.185
I'm so sorry, everyone.

48:13.886 --> 48:17.153
This is all my fault.
I should never...

48:17.155 --> 48:18.221
[sobs]

48:18.223 --> 48:20.392
Moxy, wait! Wait!

48:23.562 --> 48:28.465
Now, Ox, I'm an amazingly magnanimous
guy, so I'll tell you what:

48:28.467 --> 48:30.166
Go back to Uglyville.

48:30.168 --> 48:33.037
Live your little ugly lives.
Never come back here.

48:33.039 --> 48:37.342
And if you do,
it's Recycling for everyone.

48:43.615 --> 48:47.486
I bet they'll be back.
That little pink one never gives up.

48:47.887 --> 48:51.256
Yes, well, neither do I.

49:01.533 --> 49:05.836
Extra! Extra! People of
Uglyville are revealed to be...

49:05.838 --> 49:07.237
"Rejects"?

49:07.239 --> 49:08.739
Who'd have thunk?

49:08.741 --> 49:10.941
We heard it straight
from Ox's mouth.

49:10.943 --> 49:14.277
Yep, it's time to wake up
and smell the ugly.

49:14.279 --> 49:16.381
Just the bag, please.

49:19.351 --> 49:20.452
[sighs]

49:22.287 --> 49:24.421
Whee!

49:24.423 --> 49:26.523
I've arrived!
I can't wait to learn

49:26.525 --> 49:29.261
about this magical place
and all my...

49:29.896 --> 49:31.931
Oh. [whimpers]

49:40.873 --> 49:42.773
[Ugly Dog] I wish I could say
it wasn't so.

49:42.775 --> 49:45.375
Things will never be
the same around here.

49:45.377 --> 49:48.445
Brother,
can you spare a button?

49:48.447 --> 49:50.647
- [button clinking]
- Hard times.

49:50.649 --> 49:52.819
Hard, hard times.

50:04.463 --> 50:05.898
[sniffles]

50:06.799 --> 50:09.334
[grunts]

50:21.413 --> 50:22.647
[sighs]

50:24.449 --> 50:25.985
[Moxy] Sorry, Uglyville.

50:27.954 --> 50:29.488
[sighs]

50:41.500 --> 50:42.833
Ugh!

50:42.835 --> 50:44.103
[sighs]

50:56.115 --> 50:59.216
[grunts]
Hey, yo. Wake up.

50:59.218 --> 51:01.886
Or don't. It doesn't matter.

51:01.888 --> 51:05.490
I wish I was sleeping. I don't know
why I'm up all early in the morning.

51:09.361 --> 51:11.396
I can't do this anymore.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.233
[Mandy]
Did that make you feel better?

51:16.235 --> 51:18.670
Mandy?
What are you doing here?

51:19.172 --> 51:22.740
Moxy, you have to go back
and complete the Gauntlet.

51:22.742 --> 51:25.745
- [sighs] There's no point.
- That's where you're wrong.

51:26.645 --> 51:30.247
All your life you knew the truth
and you never stopped believing.

51:30.249 --> 51:31.816
And you were right!

51:31.818 --> 51:34.185
I never would have had
the courage to come here

51:34.187 --> 51:35.720
if it weren't for you.

51:39.058 --> 51:40.758
[sighs]

51:40.760 --> 51:42.893
If you give up now
because you're not perfect,

51:42.895 --> 51:44.696
what hope
do the rest of us have?

51:45.097 --> 51:48.067
With five eyes or wedged heads
or glasses?

51:48.366 --> 51:50.366
You need to fight, Moxy.

51:50.368 --> 51:53.369
Show them it's our differences
that make us shine.

- [Moxy] Whoa!
- [Mandy] Hey!

55:24.517 --> 55:27.418
We are getting so good
at kidnapping, right?

55:27.420 --> 55:29.321
[Moxy] Let us out,
you beautiful monsters!

55:29.955 --> 55:31.791
- [gasps]
- [Moxy] Whoa!

55:34.493 --> 55:36.226
[Lydia]
Lou? What you doing here?

55:36.228 --> 55:38.495
You didn't think I was gonna
miss all the fun, did you?

55:38.497 --> 55:40.630
You did miss the whole climbing
down, kidnapping, dragging,

55:40.632 --> 55:42.332
climbing back up,
being tired part.

55:42.334 --> 55:45.302
I see you brought Mandy, too.
How delightful.

55:45.304 --> 55:47.570
But you told us to bring Moxy
back to you and...

55:47.572 --> 55:49.475
I came up
with a far better plan.

55:51.777 --> 55:54.978
What are you doing? You've
already crushed their spirits.

55:54.980 --> 55:56.947
Sure,
Uglyville may be crushed,

55:56.949 --> 56:00.284
but we both know
Moxy will never give up.

56:00.286 --> 56:03.520
Without you around,
the rest of them will stay away forever.

56:03.522 --> 56:06.256
The only reason I let you
stay in Perfection

56:06.258 --> 56:07.758
was to keep up appearances.

56:07.760 --> 56:09.526
Everybody says, "Oh, Lou,

56:09.528 --> 56:11.495
you're so nice!
You're the best!"

56:11.497 --> 56:13.766
Do you know how long I've
worked for that adulation?

56:14.433 --> 56:16.467
Those Pretty Dolls,
they're mine.

56:16.469 --> 56:18.001
They hang on my every word.

56:18.003 --> 56:19.803
And if you think
I'm gonna let you

56:19.805 --> 56:21.671
take that away from me,

56:21.673 --> 56:25.010
you're as empty-headed
as the rest of them.

- You're both ugly.

56:37.655 --> 56:40.623

belong in Recycling.

- You can't do this!

- Ugh.

57:31.443 --> 57:33.177
Wouldn't you hide too

if you were responsible
for all of this?

57:35.047 --> 57:37.447
Whoa!
It's not all her fault.

57:37.449 --> 57:41.620
I mean, I just went along with
it without so much as a bark.

57:41.921 --> 57:46.356
All I wanted to do was help her get
a look inside that magic flower.

57:46.358 --> 57:49.393
It all started
with the tea leaves.

57:49.395 --> 57:51.096
My tea leaves.

57:56.735 --> 58:01.071
Oh, yeah. I never tried
to talk to her out of it.

58:01.073 --> 58:04.141
I thought it was
a great idea all along.
