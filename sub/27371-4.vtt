the Trojan War,

the Trojan War was real.

For centuries,
the Bible's Old Testament

13:39.586 --> 13:41.252

that mentioned

13:41.254 --> 13:43.922
the mysterious Hittite people,

has revealed that the Hittites

13:46.326 --> 13:49.761
were actually a major player
in the ancient world.

13:49.763 --> 13:52.564
Between 1700 and 1200 BC,

13:52.566 --> 13:55.366
the time that the Trojan War
would have been happening,

13:55.368 --> 13:57.769
the Hittites controlled
massive swathes of land

13:57.771 --> 14:02.774
from the western coast of Turkey
to Syria and Lebanon.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.909
The Hittites are part of
what I call

14:04.911 --> 14:08.213
the G8 of the ancient world.
-Okay.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.148
The Hittite Empire
was basically everything

14:10.150 --> 14:12.050
that's in red on this map,

14:12.052 --> 14:15.920
and then the capital city
is right here, Hattusa,

14:15.922 --> 14:18.122
and Troy is over here.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.657
But the true power
of the Hittites

14:19.659 --> 14:21.860
was not the land
they conquered.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.896
It was the precious ancient
knowledge that they left behind.

The connections that we've got

14:34.374 --> 14:37.108
They hit
all of the tablets.

FOX: During excavations near the
location of the Hittite capital,

14:40.747 --> 14:42.814
archaeologists uncovered
a massive

14:42.816 --> 14:46.251
cache of over 25,000 clay
tablets

the oldest-known peace treaty

14:49.155 --> 14:54.359

14:56.396 --> 14:59.063

within 5 or 6 years or so,

14:59.065 --> 15:01.065

this was a treasure trove.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.067
Within that
period of time,

15:03.069 --> 15:07.538
they found tablets
mentioning things like Troy.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.676
In the Hittite text, there is
a place they call Wilusa.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.445
Wilusa is the Hittite
name for Troy

15:14.447 --> 15:18.016
because the original name
for Troy was Wilios.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.284
Mm.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.385
Doesn't Wilios sound a lot
like Wilusa?

15:20.387 --> 15:23.388
-Yeah.
-Yeah, so I kind of go, "Hmm."

15:23.390 --> 15:25.890
Now, let me add something else
into the equation here,

15:25.892 --> 15:28.526
and this is where
the Trojan War comes in.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.928
In the Hittite records,

15:29.930 --> 15:33.831
some of the tablets
that deal with Wilusa and Troy

15:33.833 --> 15:36.601
also talked about the Greeks,
and they talked about wars

15:36.603 --> 15:39.137
involving the Greeks
and the Trojans, and...

15:39.139 --> 15:40.505
-Ooh, that's exciting.
-Isn't it?

15:40.507 --> 15:41.773
-Yeah.
-I know. I know.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.008
Now, where it gets even
more interesting --

15:44.010 --> 15:47.345
There is a treaty between
one of the Hittite kings

15:47.347 --> 15:51.049
with a guy
named Alaksandu of Wilusa.

15:51.051 --> 15:54.385
So we already said another
name for Troy is Wilios.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.620
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.389
Paris, as in Paris
and Helen and all that,

15:58.391 --> 16:00.024
there's another name
for Paris, right?

16:00.026 --> 16:03.127
His name is Alexander.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.196

of the king of Troy,

16:05.198 --> 16:07.365
who Homer said abducted
the Greek queen Helen

16:07.367 --> 16:09.534
and ignited the Trojan War,

16:09.536 --> 16:14.806
was also given the name
Alexander as a child.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.874
CLINE: Let's see if I can
diagram this for you.

16:16.876 --> 16:19.978
We've got Paris, right?

16:19.980 --> 16:24.716
Alternate name for him
is Alexander.

16:24.718 --> 16:27.485
We've also got Troy.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.521
Alternate name for that
is Wilios.

16:30.523 --> 16:35.026
So if you've got Alexander
of Wilios from Homer,

16:35.028 --> 16:38.129
and you've got
Alaksandu of Wilusa,

16:38.131 --> 16:40.398
on the other hand,
from the Hittites...

16:40.400 --> 16:41.866
I like Occam's razor --

16:41.868 --> 16:44.135
"The simplest solution
is probably the most correct."

16:44.137 --> 16:46.838
I think that might be
the same guy.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.106
Yeah.

you could argue against it.

The key to uncovering the truth
about the Trojan War

20:34.467 --> 20:37.368
could be with one of the Greek's
greatest heroes --

20:37.370 --> 20:42.340
Achilles, a fearsome half-man,
half-god warrior

20:42.342 --> 20:45.743
who slays Trojans
by the dozens.

20:45.745 --> 20:49.247
"The Iliad" is the story
of the wrath of Achilles,

20:49.249 --> 20:51.515
and then there's passages
within "The Iliad"

20:51.517 --> 20:53.150

of where
Achilles might have been.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.821
Specific enough
where you go,

"Oh, this must be the place
because this is the only place

21:01.527 --> 21:04.996

he wrote in this passage"?

21:04.998 --> 21:07.064
Pretty much, right?

21:07.066 --> 21:09.767
Okay, so here we've got
a little passage of "Book II"

21:09.769 --> 21:11.435
of "The Iliad,"

21:11.437 --> 21:13.904
so, Achilles,
he's down by the beach.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.407
So we've got his horses
and the chariots.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.909
They are tethered, and
the horses are grazing on...

21:18.911 --> 21:20.711
And he's very specific
about this.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.980
The horses are eating this
really particular type

21:22.982 --> 21:25.783
of clover, which is
fed on freshwater marshes,

21:25.785 --> 21:27.718

21:27.720 --> 21:30.021
we've got a freshwater stream,
which runs down,

21:30.023 --> 21:31.656

22:29.415 --> 22:30.548
Something close.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.249
Actually, it's towards
the end of "The Iliad."

22:32.251 --> 22:34.685
Achilles' best friend,
and actually, we think,

22:34.687 --> 22:37.555
his lover, Patroclus,
dies in battle.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.390
Achilles is grieving,
and what he does is,

22:39.392 --> 22:42.193
he buries his lover here,

22:42.195 --> 22:44.795
and what Achilles requests
is that, when he dies,

22:44.797 --> 22:47.598
he's buried in the same
mound as Patroclus.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.900
In fact, actually, the ghost
of Patroclus

22:49.902 --> 22:51.435
comes back
to talk to Achilles,

22:51.437 --> 22:53.771
and he says, "Don't let us
be separated in death.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.005
We weren't
separated in life.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.141
Let's not be
separated in death."

22:57.143 --> 22:59.443
FOX: The belief that Achilles
was buried at this mound

22:59.445 --> 23:02.313
was so strong
that even one of the most famous

23:02.315 --> 23:04.315
and powerful kings
of the ancient world

23:04.317 --> 23:07.451
came here to pay his respects.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.954
Alexander the Great
comes to visit, right?

23:09.956 --> 23:14.325
He thinks it's Achilles' tomb,
so then they start to...

23:14.327 --> 23:16.026
You know, they have a whole
bunch of ceremonies around it.

23:16.028 --> 23:18.329
He and his lover, Hephaestion,

23:18.331 --> 23:20.731
they kind of celebrate
Achilles and Patroclus

23:20.733 --> 23:24.635
as kind of...
as parallels for themselves.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.137
When he leaves, in the years
that follow,

23:26.139 --> 23:27.738
they start building
the mound higher,

23:27.740 --> 23:29.473
so they actually
raised the mound

23:29.475 --> 23:31.275
another kind of 12 meters or so.

23:31.277 --> 23:32.576
It's like a tourist destination,
right?

23:32.578 --> 23:34.211
So Alexander is
the first tourist

23:34.213 --> 23:37.081
to come to pay
homage to Achilles.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.916
How many times
has it been excavated?

23:38.918 --> 23:39.984
Do you know?

23:39.986 --> 23:41.719
So it's never been
fully excavated,

23:41.721 --> 23:44.355
but we've had a couple of slices
kind of cut out of it,

23:44.357 --> 23:45.856
enough to know
what's going on.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.658
Is that a burial mound?

23:49.962 --> 23:51.462
-No, right?
-Okay.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.097
We know now,
through excavations,

23:53.099 --> 23:54.665
that it's
a settlement mound.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.967
That's where basically
people lived.

FOX: Although Achilles
isn't buried here,

23:59.138 --> 24:03.007

end with Alexander the Great.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.176

Roman emperors,

24:05.178 --> 24:07.611
powerful sultans

24:16.289 --> 24:17.555
Yeah.

There's really just a whole
landscape full of mounds

the tomb of Achilles.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.528
Why are there so many
potential tombs for him?

Different people want to claim
a link with the Homeric past

a powerful shared past.

If we can find Achilles' final
resting place,

24:34.941 --> 24:36.907

actually happened,

I talked to,

34:16.188 --> 34:18.221
Professor Eberhard Zangger,

34:18.223 --> 34:20.357
he would argue that,
collectively,

34:20.359 --> 34:23.927
those kingdoms have this
shared cultural identity.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.930
He would call that
a Luwian civilization,

34:26.932 --> 34:29.366
and Troy itself
is actually...

34:29.368 --> 34:32.269
As well as being the site of
the Trojans, it's a Luwian town.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.871
It's part of a Luwian kingdom.

34:36.442 --> 34:39.943
"Well, who are the Trojans?"
the Trojans were Luwians.

34:39.945 --> 34:43.046
That's why the Luwian seal is
there because it belonged there.

34:43.048 --> 34:44.381

34:44.383 --> 34:47.384

were a part of that.

So according to this theory,
during the 13th century BC,

34:51.590 --> 34:53.490
the time of the Trojan War,

34:53.492 --> 34:57.360
this area of the world was split

have to go, like, much grander.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.315
gain more wealth,

their large area of land,

35:27.526 --> 35:30.160
becoming an even more
powerful force,

35:30.162 --> 35:33.096
and the fear was that
they wouldn't stop there.

35:33.098 --> 35:36.733
So at the point that war is
breaking out, we can argue

35:36.735 --> 35:40.770
that there were really two
major superpowers, if you will,

35:40.772 --> 35:44.441
in the region at this time --
the Mycenaeans and the Luwians,

35:44.443 --> 35:47.677
and the Mycenaeans decide
that they might well

35:47.679 --> 35:49.880
be next on the hit list.

35:49.882 --> 35:52.516
They sail across the sea,

35:52.518 --> 35:55.452
begin attacking the Luwians
in their own territory,

35:55.454 --> 35:57.921
including, most famously,
Troy itself.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.856
Well, it seems like it was
a battle

35:59.858 --> 36:01.691
that was part of
a much larger one.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.059
Exactly.
Exactly.

36:03.061 --> 36:05.896
So no longer are we seeing Troy
as an isolated battle.

36:05.898 --> 36:10.066
Maybe it was actually a skirmish
in a much broader war

36:10.068 --> 36:12.802
that was being fought on
multiple fronts, World War Zero.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.172
Wow.

36:15.174 --> 36:18.008
That's so cool.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.911
So in that scenario,
Troy would have been a lot

36:20.913 --> 36:25.682
like the D-Day
of World War II.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.784
In essence, yeah.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.686
FOX: Up until this point
in the investigation,

36:29.688 --> 36:32.656
it's only been
about the Trojan War,

36:32.658 --> 36:34.991
that Troy could've just been
a smaller battle

36:34.993 --> 36:36.359
that was a part
of this huge war.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.729
This is something
that is revolutionary.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.766
If what was going on at Troy was
part of something much larger,

36:42.768 --> 36:45.368
what we would consider
a World War Zero,

36:45.370 --> 36:48.405
why do you think we have
only Homer's retelling?

36:48.407 --> 36:50.307
Right.
What's going on there?

36:50.309 --> 36:54.077
What happened after this
World War Zero scenario is,

36:54.079 --> 36:56.580
basically, there's a collapse
across the entire region.

36:56.582 --> 36:58.381
Civilizations are falling,

36:58.383 --> 37:01.551
and archaeologists
would call this episode

37:01.553 --> 37:02.953
the Bronze Age Collapse,

37:02.955 --> 37:05.689

the most dramatic events

37:05.691 --> 37:07.224
in the entire history
of this region.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.593
So we're really talking
about the Dark Age.

written records.

A hundred years after the
Trojan War would've happened,

37:30.282 --> 37:32.415
After this dark period ends,

37:32.417 --> 37:35.719
Homer rises to prominence
and writes "The Iliad."

37:35.721 --> 37:38.421
Was Homer a keeper
of this ancient knowledge,

37:38.423 --> 37:41.324
and that's why he's the first
and only person to commit

37:41.326 --> 37:44.294
this epic history
to written record?

37:44.296 --> 37:46.596
This, I think, seems probable

37:46.598 --> 37:48.665
because you have someone
hundreds of years later

37:48.667 --> 37:50.567
writing this epic poem
about it.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.068
It had to be...

37:52.070 --> 37:54.371
There had to be more because
like you said, and you noted,

37:54.373 --> 37:57.307
Troy was such a small town.

37:57.309 --> 38:01.211
So what was it about that
that was so impactful

38:01.213 --> 38:03.480

in "The Iliad," you know,

38:03.482 --> 38:06.583
all of the gods are involved
in what's going on,

38:06.585 --> 38:08.685

to something.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.387
It was worldwide.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.959
by this fight and this battle
that was going on.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.994
So, for me, this resonates
with me

38:17.996 --> 38:22.432

The opening is 20 feet, about
the width of a two-car garage.
