12:51.270 --> 12:53.372
- That
recent son of a bitch,

12:53.373 --> 12:55.841
didn't go down so easy.

12:55.842 --> 12:59.278
Now I've gotta do twice as good,

12:59.279 --> 13:00.811
on the next.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.284
And I'm right to keep going.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.784
To be the one,

13:07.286 --> 13:09.021
and only one,

13:09.022 --> 13:11.689
here in the asshole
of the world.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.128
Got nothing better to do.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.232
Solar panel inspect,

13:20.233 --> 13:23.169
check battery light
on sensor beacons,

13:23.170 --> 13:24.370
make some dinner,

13:24.371 --> 13:28.707
resupply bullets, 10
cases, 50 clips each,

13:28.708 --> 13:31.310
beans, 140 cans,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.512
tuna, 57 cans,

13:33.513 --> 13:35.546
peaches, 10 cans,

13:35.981 --> 13:38.482
water, still filtering.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.321
Call

13:43.589 --> 13:45.256
the assholes.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.268
They can keep coming,

13:56.269 --> 13:58.836
because here I'll sit.

14:04.343 --> 14:09.447
They deserve it,
they deserve it,

14:09.448 --> 14:11.515
they god damn

14:13.719 --> 14:15.186
deserve it.

21:34.493 --> 21:39.863
Another goes down, but
not nearly fast enough.

21:45.003 --> 21:48.974
It's a race, but what I need
to make it, is running out.

21:48.975 --> 21:53.412
Physical, mental, everything
is being exhausted right now.

21:53.413 --> 21:56.148
But the sense of
accomplishment is coming back.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.517
I know it's almost the end,

21:58.518 --> 22:00.852
each one does have its own way,

22:00.853 --> 22:04.423
its own trait,
maybe even emotion.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.758
I think it changes
a small piece of me,

22:06.759 --> 22:10.362
and so I can get on
with what I have,

22:10.363 --> 22:12.029
and be happy,

22:13.865 --> 22:15.232
or,

22:15.600 --> 22:17.901
a resemblance of that.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.006
Thought a lot about mom today,

22:21.007 --> 22:24.910
I wonder often how mad she
would be right at this moment,

22:24.911 --> 22:27.612
or could there be
any chance of pride,

22:27.613 --> 22:30.115
in those lists of emotions?

22:30.116 --> 22:31.616
I thought of you, mom.

22:31.617 --> 22:35.120
The air was the right
smell of something,

22:35.121 --> 22:38.924
some flower, I don't
know which one,

22:38.925 --> 22:40.392
but it's blooming,

22:40.393 --> 22:41.927
the perfect temperature,

22:41.928 --> 22:45.097
and the angle and
intensity of the sun,

22:45.098 --> 22:47.599
at just the right moment,

22:47.600 --> 22:51.703
and for 10 seconds, while we
were sitting in the backyard,

22:51.704 --> 22:55.439
watching Mira,
sniffing out chipmunks.

22:57.242 --> 23:00.244
You know, she's a great dog.

23:03.181 --> 23:05.450
If I could live
in those moments,

23:05.451 --> 23:07.152
I could leave here.

23:07.153 --> 23:10.387
Just one more left, mom.

23:14.826 --> 23:17.928
Everything will be right, pride,

23:18.363 --> 23:20.665
but that will be
the only emotion

23:20.666 --> 23:23.502
that you feel about me then.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.502
All will be healed,

23:25.837 --> 23:28.605
with the fullness of time.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.532
- I apologize.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.768
No, no, please refrain.
No, please, stop.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.171
Stop. Put it down.
Refrain. Refrain.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.872
Wait, no, please, refrain.

36:14.873 --> 36:18.342
Wait, stop, wait, wait.

36:18.343 --> 36:23.280
Wait, no need for such behavior.

36:23.281 --> 36:30.086
Please, stop, wait,
please, put it away,

36:31.522 --> 36:35.291
put, it, down.

36:46.971 --> 36:48.439
Thank you.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.772
Thank you.

36:50.208 --> 36:53.311
Please be seated, take comfort.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.946
I mean you no detriment.

36:54.947 --> 36:58.749
I apologize for the intrusion,

36:58.750 --> 37:04.387
but urgent matters must be
discussed at this present time.

37:07.825 --> 37:09.427
I apologize.

37:09.428 --> 37:13.262
- Would you prefer
this manner as orating?

37:27.111 --> 37:29.247
- Perhaps not.

37:29.248 --> 37:32.316
I remember you in the
days of your youth,

37:32.317 --> 37:35.620
before the instrument
was implanted in you.

37:35.621 --> 37:38.522
You were always the silent one.

37:38.523 --> 37:41.759
I was sent on the behalf

37:41.760 --> 37:43.860
of your adversaries.

37:44.562 --> 37:48.299
These assassinations
will gain you nothing.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.501
They're willing pardon your acts

37:50.502 --> 37:54.905
if you are willing to regain

37:54.906 --> 37:57.473
their trust,

37:58.709 --> 38:03.514
and cooperate by implanting
the recording device

38:03.515 --> 38:06.083
back into your retina.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.785
Wait, wait, wait.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.654
If I don't repeat myself,

38:09.655 --> 38:12.223
there is no reason for you to
use that weapon against me.

38:12.224 --> 38:13.724
I shall be brief.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.059
You know quite well

38:15.060 --> 38:19.195
that this dispute you
bear is utterly pathetic.

38:24.502 --> 38:28.504
More are coming.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.475
And others.

38:41.085 --> 38:44.188
Others who are willing
to take precautions

38:44.189 --> 38:46.722
for your murderous acts.

38:47.692 --> 38:51.529
They don't believe in the
wicked contingencies of man,

38:51.530 --> 38:55.933
wielding those primitive
weapons of violence.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.501
Don't fail to overlook

38:58.936 --> 39:03.274
they will use your own
devices against you.

39:03.275 --> 39:07.778
They shall decrease to
your manner of knowledge,

39:07.779 --> 39:11.015
and absorb that
irrelevant emotion,

39:11.016 --> 39:15.551
the one you creatures
call, anger.

39:19.123 --> 39:22.927
The last one has already
penetrated through

39:22.928 --> 39:25.963
your transmitting instruments.

39:25.964 --> 39:30.466
Are you still undergoing
technical difficulties?

39:39.577 --> 39:42.144
Cooperate,

39:42.146 --> 39:44.213
please.

39:45.049 --> 39:48.486
Their only desire is to
progress in knowledge,

39:48.487 --> 39:50.955
with no inconvenience.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.489
Stop this dispute.

39:53.991 --> 39:57.293
If you do terminate
the final one,

39:57.928 --> 39:59.996
what will you gain?

40:08.906 --> 40:10.940
What will you gain?

40:14.044 --> 40:16.012
Eternal ecstasy?

40:19.116 --> 40:23.319
Will you be reunited
with your loved ones?

40:25.022 --> 40:27.089
And rejoice?

40:49.547 --> 40:51.782
Can you return to
your past life,

40:51.783 --> 40:55.184
and forget all your
past struggles?

40:59.990 --> 41:01.557
And rejoice?

41:04.728 --> 41:09.498
Will all your journal
entries one day be fulfilled?

41:11.101 --> 41:13.502
You are fooling yourself.

41:14.438 --> 41:19.677
After all the wisdom and
strengths you've inherited,

41:19.678 --> 41:23.646
and blood is still
coursing in your veins.

41:24.615 --> 41:28.752
You can't go back,

41:28.753 --> 41:32.990
the scar in your mind,
and on your face,

41:32.991 --> 41:34.925
will never attract the eyes,

41:34.926 --> 41:38.327
especially the heart of another.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.100
No one will understand,

41:43.101 --> 41:46.604
nor tolerate your
past conflicts.

41:46.605 --> 41:50.107
No one, except, the ones

41:50.108 --> 41:53.509
that control your way of living.

41:55.646 --> 41:59.016
Government curiosity will
make your past procedures

41:59.017 --> 42:01.784
resemble a blissful paradise.

42:05.489 --> 42:07.558
You are forsaken
by your own world,

42:07.559 --> 42:09.727
but not by them.

42:09.728 --> 42:13.262
They will accept you.

42:22.306 --> 42:23.639
Please.

42:32.483 --> 42:34.550
You have no choice.

42:45.029 --> 42:49.400
Agree to re-implant the
transcription device,

42:49.401 --> 42:56.105
and allow uploading sessions,
only twice a year, not four.

43:00.277 --> 43:05.282
There have been several
advances in the procedure.

43:05.283 --> 43:10.086
Please, desist in
these assassinations.

43:16.126 --> 43:21.697
You can't stop progress.

44:01.672 --> 44:04.206
Oh yes, I nearly forgot.

44:06.143 --> 44:08.812
The geothermal sequencer
needs to be rewired

44:08.813 --> 44:11.847
to the mainframe and calibrated.

44:18.255 --> 44:19.588
Take care.

45:00.364 --> 45:05.134
- Taking
a day to enjoy the weather.

45:12.676 --> 45:17.413
No fun for my face but, it's
finally warming a little,

45:18.582 --> 45:21.550
and I don't want to miss it.

45:22.352 --> 45:26.755
My problems, yeah they're
always present of course,

45:29.426 --> 45:33.229
but for this exact moment,

45:34.732 --> 45:40.803
I am choosing a
deserved mental break.

45:41.872 --> 45:43.240
The start of spring,

45:43.241 --> 45:47.945
so the lingering light
bite of winter is here,

45:47.946 --> 45:50.280
but the snow is gone.

45:50.281 --> 45:53.682
And I hear the birds.

45:55.953 --> 45:57.686
I missed them.

46:01.024 --> 46:03.827
I missed the noises
that are all around,

46:03.828 --> 46:08.597
and comforting when the
winter weather finally breaks.

46:10.467 --> 46:14.970
Next up is green grass.

46:16.073 --> 46:19.141
Leaves, animals,

46:19.376 --> 46:21.645
I just hope I can enjoy that.

46:21.646 --> 46:25.848
Back to spring,
back to openness,

46:26.450 --> 46:27.816
back to

46:29.920 --> 46:32.888
other things in life besides

46:33.290 --> 46:37.693
focusing on justice.

46:42.166 --> 46:44.166
Can it ever happen?

46:49.106 --> 46:51.073
Can it ever happen?

46:55.445 --> 46:56.812
Yes,

46:58.415 --> 47:00.816
I like to believe it can.

53:47.591 --> 53:51.928
- If you
do terminate the final one,

53:51.929 --> 53:54.162
what will you gain?

54:00.370 --> 54:03.638
Can you return to
your past life?

54:04.374 --> 54:06.441
And rejoice?

54:13.550 --> 54:16.785
You can't go back.

54:25.895 --> 54:30.098
Will you be reunited
with your loved ones?

54:42.879 --> 54:46.950
Will you be reunited

54:46.951 --> 54:49.184
with your loved ones?

54:49.586 --> 54:53.156
That is his question to me.

54:53.157 --> 54:57.627
You are fooling yourself.

54:57.628 --> 54:59.529
But truthfully,

54:59.530 --> 55:03.398
I've asked myself
that a hundred times.

55:05.435 --> 55:07.068
I don't know.

55:12.742 --> 55:16.311
I've not known the answer,

55:16.946 --> 55:19.214
for a very long time.

55:24.654 --> 55:27.057
The scar in your mind,

55:27.058 --> 55:28.858
and on your face,

55:28.859 --> 55:31.895
will never attract the eyes,

55:31.896 --> 55:35.430
especially the heart of another.

55:36.099 --> 55:38.835
- My
hope comes and goes,

55:38.836 --> 55:41.104
as often as they do.

55:41.105 --> 55:45.173
I am fully aware,

55:47.310 --> 55:49.845
I'm not the same person.

55:56.986 --> 55:59.089
But is that terrible?

55:59.090 --> 56:02.390
Am I worse than I was?

56:03.326 --> 56:07.597
Or just different,
with all that I know,

56:07.598 --> 56:10.033
about the truth and the stars?

56:10.034 --> 56:14.369
But I have become better,

56:15.538 --> 56:17.305
because of it.

56:18.508 --> 56:22.412
Their blood may course
through my veins,

56:22.413 --> 56:24.547
but so does mine.

56:24.548 --> 56:30.186
It's still my brain that
moves my arms, my legs,

56:30.187 --> 56:33.955
gives my heart love,
as well as anger.

56:34.524 --> 56:39.996
There is nothing
irrelevant to emotion.

56:39.997 --> 56:43.333
Everything we do in
life is tied to it.

56:43.334 --> 56:47.003
It isn't learned,
it is part of us.

56:47.004 --> 56:50.807
It can build us up,
it can destroy us.

56:50.808 --> 56:53.910
It can do both,
with no intervention.

56:53.911 --> 56:58.481
It truly is
emotion that is driving
me to finish them off.

56:58.482 --> 57:01.117
No one will understand,

57:01.118 --> 57:05.021
nor tolerate your
past conflicts.

57:05.022 --> 57:08.124
- He
was wrong on one thing.

57:08.125 --> 57:10.794
It is not anger,

57:10.795 --> 57:13.062
it is not hope,

57:13.063 --> 57:16.299
it is for the love
i keep buried,

57:16.300 --> 57:20.570
love of nature, people,

57:20.571 --> 57:24.040
the spring blossoms that
are over my head now,

57:24.041 --> 57:26.176
to watch the sunset,

57:26.177 --> 57:30.780
and wonder, childlike, as to
where the sun goes each night,

57:30.781 --> 57:33.950
a pure passion to actually live,

57:33.951 --> 57:37.387
to go through life learning
about things around me,

57:37.388 --> 57:41.024
without needing to
know everything,

57:41.025 --> 57:43.124
or every outcome.

57:44.794 --> 57:48.630
What will you gain?

57:52.335 --> 57:54.636
What will you gain?

57:58.341 --> 58:01.578
The freedom from

58:01.579 --> 58:02.911
knowledge.

58:06.583 --> 58:10.019
Freedom to progress as I desire,

58:10.020 --> 58:12.422
not forced to progress.

58:12.423 --> 58:15.158
The choice to sleep
without memories,

58:15.159 --> 58:17.026
and wake without fear,

58:17.027 --> 58:22.599
the confidence that
what happens for me,

58:22.600 --> 58:24.499
and the future,

58:25.168 --> 58:30.071
it's driven by,

58:32.709 --> 58:34.075
me.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.109
- Hello?

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:40.680
Hello there.

01:08:41.082 --> 01:08:42.383
Hello?

01:08:42.984 --> 01:08:44.551
Hello there.

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:48.288
So,

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:52.595
what have you gained

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:55.598
from all this,

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:57.163
violence?

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:06.040
There are others coming.

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:14.180
You can't stop progress.
