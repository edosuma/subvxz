Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:24.474 --> 00:26.057
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST OPEN THE OVEN

00:26.125 --> 00:27.392
BEFORE YOU PICKED UP
THE TURKEY?

00:29.061 --> 00:30.845
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,

00:30.913 --> 00:32.314
<i>WHY DON'T YOU
OPEN THE OVEN</i>

00:32.381 --> 00:34.766
BEFORE I DUMP HOT TURKEY
JUICE ALL OVER YOUR PRIVATES?!

00:34.833 --> 00:37.652
I DO BELIEVE SOMEONE'S
FLIRTIN' WITH ME.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.754
OK. THANK YOU.

00:39.822 --> 00:42.290
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THAT'S IT.

00:42.358 --> 00:43.992
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

00:44.059 --> 00:46.695
THOSE YAMS ARE NOT
GONNA CANDY THEMSELVES.

00:46.762 --> 00:48.029
WOW, THIS IS AMAZING.

00:48.096 --> 00:49.096
YOU'RE COOKIN' A MEAL,

00:49.165 --> 00:51.199
AND THERE'S NO
SMOKE ALARMS GOIN' OFF,

00:51.267 --> 00:54.035
NO DOGS HOWLIN'
IN THE ALLEY.

00:54.102 --> 00:56.837
I KNOW! I'M JUST
AS SURPRISED AS YOU ARE!

00:56.905 --> 00:58.923
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT I'M
ACTUALLY GONNA PULL OFF

00:58.991 --> 01:01.592
A HOME-COOKED THANKSGIVING
DINNER FOR 10 PEOPLE?

01:01.660 --> 01:04.346
I MEAN, THAT BEATS
MY PREVIOUS RECORD BY...

01:04.413 --> 01:06.181
10!

01:07.483 --> 01:08.816
OH, GRAVY'S DONE.

01:08.884 --> 01:10.135
OH, SWEET!

01:10.202 --> 01:11.269
OFF, OFF, OFF!

01:11.337 --> 01:13.438
SORRY. I HEARD A BELL.
I'M LIKE A FIGHTER THAT WAY.

01:13.506 --> 01:15.407
<i>SO WHAT CAN I HAVE?</i>

01:15.475 --> 01:17.209
YOU CAN EAT ANYTHING
OVER HERE, ALL RIGHT?

01:17.276 --> 01:18.843
JUST GET SOMETHING
OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR.

01:18.911 --> 01:21.128
SO ANY WORD
FROM YOUR DAD UPSTATE?

01:21.196 --> 01:23.931
YES, UM... APPARENTLY HE HAD
A FIGHT WITH HIS COUSIN-IN-LAW,

01:23.999 --> 01:26.367
AND THEY HAVE TO EAT
THANKSGIVING DINNER IN SHIFTS.

01:26.435 --> 01:28.303
IT'S GONNA BE WEIRD

01:28.370 --> 01:30.971
HAVING OUR THANKSGIVING
WITHOUT HIM, RIGHT?

01:31.039 --> 01:32.123
YEAH, I'M REALLY
GONNA MISS THE SIGHT

01:32.190 --> 01:34.726
OF A 10-COURSE MEAL GETTIN'
CAUGHT IN THE MAN'S MUSTACHE.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.461
AH, LEFTOVER PIZZA,

01:37.529 --> 01:40.564
JUST UNDER
THE 5-DAY LIMIT.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.269
WAIT, WHOA. WHAT
ARE YOU DOING? NO.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.303
GONNA REHEAT PIZZA.

01:45.371 --> 01:47.338
THE BROCCOLI
IS COOKING IN THERE.

01:47.406 --> 01:49.623
SO? CAN'T I GRAB A RIDE
FOR 30 SECONDS?

01:49.691 --> 01:52.394
NO! THEN THE BROCCOLI'S
GONNA TASTE LIKE PEPPERONI!

01:52.461 --> 01:54.362
AND A PARADE WILL
BE THROWN IN YOUR HONOR.

01:54.429 --> 01:58.132
OK, HERE'S WHAT I NEED
YOU TO DO:

01:58.200 --> 01:59.800
FIRST, LEAVE.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.002
SECOND,
SET THE TABLE.

02:01.070 --> 02:02.303
YOU THINK
YOU CAN MANAGE THAT?

02:02.371 --> 02:03.671
WHAT'S THIS?

02:03.739 --> 02:04.705
THE SILVER PLACE
SETTINGS

02:04.773 --> 02:06.307
YOUR PARENTS GAVE US
FOR OUR WEDDING.

02:06.375 --> 02:07.258
WHY IS IT IN THIS?

02:07.410 --> 02:09.110
AM I TAKING THEM
ON VACATION?

02:09.176 --> 02:10.345
YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE.

02:10.413 --> 02:11.546
PLEASE, JUST GO.

02:11.613 --> 02:13.114
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME
SODAS OUT OF THE GARAGE.

02:22.041 --> 02:23.191
OH, WOW.

02:26.395 --> 02:27.929
I'M EATIN'
WITH THIS ONE.

02:37.106 --> 02:38.272
HELLO.

02:38.340 --> 02:40.625
FINALLY, SOMEBODY HOME.
HEY, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.410
ANY WAY I COULD
USE YOUR PHONE?

02:42.478 --> 02:44.629
UH... WHAT'S UP?

02:44.697 --> 02:46.264
MY CAR DIED A COUPLE
BLOCKS FROM HERE.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.765
ENGINE SEIZED UP.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.567
THAT'S ROUGH. I MEAN,
I'M NOT MUCH OF A CAR GUY,

02:49.635 --> 02:52.120
BUT I KNOW WHEN I SEIZE UP,
I NOT FEEL SO GOOD.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.124
SURE, COME ON IN.
THANKS, MAN.

02:56.191 --> 02:57.308
IT'S GETTIN'
COLD OUT THERE.

02:57.376 --> 02:59.010
I PICKED THE WRONG DAY
TO LOSE MY CHAPSTICK.

02:59.077 --> 03:00.612
OH, BEEN THERE.

03:00.679 --> 03:01.679
THAT'S WHY I KEEP MINE

03:01.747 --> 03:03.247
IN THE LITTLE POCKET
ABOVE THE BIG POCKET.

03:03.315 --> 03:04.315
THAT'S FOR CHAPSTICK.

03:04.383 --> 03:05.817
A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW THAT.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.418
PHONE'S RIGHT THERE.

03:07.486 --> 03:08.820
THANKS.

03:15.494 --> 03:17.094
WHOA! HELLO.

03:17.162 --> 03:18.229
AND YOU ARE?

03:18.296 --> 03:20.197
THAT GUY SAID
I COULD USE THE PHONE.

03:20.265 --> 03:21.900
OH, OK.

03:26.671 --> 03:29.057
DOUG? WHAT IS A MAN
WITH AN EYE PATCH

03:29.125 --> 03:30.375
DOING IN OUR KITCHEN?

03:30.443 --> 03:31.610
HIS CAR BROKE DOWN.

03:31.677 --> 03:33.911
AND YOU JUST
LET HIM IN HERE?

03:33.979 --> 03:34.679
YEAH, HE WAS STRANDED.

03:34.830 --> 03:35.764
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO DO?

03:35.831 --> 03:37.131
HAVE YOU EVER
MET THIS MAN BEFORE?

03:37.199 --> 03:38.433
NO.

03:38.501 --> 03:40.435
AND HAVE YOU SEEN THIS "CAR"
THAT SUPPOSEDLY BROKE DOWN?

03:40.503 --> 03:41.436
NO.

03:41.504 --> 03:43.104
COULD YOU OFFER ME
ANY ASSURANCE

03:43.172 --> 03:44.506
THAT WE'RE
NOT ABOUT TO DIE?

03:44.573 --> 03:47.475
WILL YOU RELAX?
IT'S FINE.

03:47.543 --> 03:49.727
I LET PEOPLE IN HERE
ALL THE TIME.

03:49.795 --> 03:52.580
OH! OK,
THAT'S A RELIEF.

03:52.648 --> 03:54.766
EXCUSE ME, WHAT'S
YOUR ADDRESS HERE?

03:54.833 --> 03:56.534
OH, IT'S 3121 ABERDEEN.

03:56.602 --> 03:57.769
THANKS.

03:57.836 --> 03:58.736
OW!

04:00.806 --> 04:03.541
YOU DON'T JUST GIVE
A STRANGER OUR ADDRESS.

04:03.609 --> 04:05.142
IT'S ON THE DOOR!

04:05.210 --> 04:08.245
IT'S NOT LIKE I GAVE HIM
MY PIN NUMBER.

04:08.313 --> 04:11.382
ACTUALLY, I DO USE THAT
AS MY PIN NUMBER.

04:11.450 --> 04:14.718
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST GET RID OF HIM, OK?

04:19.642 --> 04:21.993
OK, MY BUDDY'S
COMING TO PICK ME UP.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.144
UH, THERE'S A DINER
ON THE CORNER.

04:23.212 --> 04:24.879
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT FOR
YOUR BUDDY OVER THERE, OK?

04:24.946 --> 04:25.964
IT'S CLOSED.

04:26.031 --> 04:27.698
EVERYTHING AROUND HERE'S
CLOSED.

04:27.766 --> 04:28.600
YOU MIND
IF I WAIT HERE?

04:28.751 --> 04:30.568
SURE.

04:30.636 --> 04:33.938
I MEAN, OUTSIDE,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

04:34.006 --> 04:35.623
OK.

04:35.690 --> 04:37.358
INSIDE WOULD BE FINE
NORMALLY,

04:37.426 --> 04:38.926
BUT WE'RE GETTIN' READY
FOR COMPANY,

04:38.994 --> 04:40.128
AND WE'RE GONNA BE
VACUUMING.

04:40.195 --> 04:41.329
IT'S GONNA BE
REAL NOISY IN HERE.

04:41.397 --> 04:42.863
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT
BETTER OUT HERE.

04:42.931 --> 04:45.199
SO JUST MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE,

04:45.267 --> 04:46.383
ALTHOUGH I'D AVOID
THAT CHAIR

04:46.451 --> 04:49.220
UNLESS YOU LIKE GETTING POKED
BY SOMETHING COLD AND RUSTY.

04:51.056 --> 04:52.023
RIGHT.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.125
SO HOW LONG
TILL YOUR BUDDY GETS HERE?

04:54.192 --> 04:55.809
UH, WELL, HE'S COMING
FROM BALTIMORE,

04:55.877 --> 04:57.311
SO I GUESS
ABOUT 4 HOURS.

05:01.216 --> 05:02.884
OK, THEN.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.043
OK, HERE SHE IS!
HAPPY THANKSGIVING!

05:16.365 --> 05:17.431
YOO-HOO!

05:17.499 --> 05:19.967
HELLO! HI!

05:23.188 --> 05:24.122
RIGHT.

05:24.189 --> 05:25.323
WELL, I GOT MINE.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.358
WHAT ARE THE REST
OF YOU HAVIN'?

05:28.644 --> 05:30.344
ALL RIGHT, LET ME CARVE
THIS BAD BOY UP.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.346
OK, IN THE MEANTIME,
EVERYBODY SERVE YOURSELVES.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.748
I GOT
SOME STUFFING...

05:33.816 --> 05:35.149
ALL RIGHT.

05:35.217 --> 05:37.318
AND SOME
SWEET POTATOES.

05:37.386 --> 05:38.319
YOU GOT THAT?

05:38.387 --> 05:40.789
AND SOME FRESH
GREEN BEANS.

05:40.856 --> 05:43.591
SON OF AN ASS!

05:43.659 --> 05:45.342
OBVIOUSLY
NOT A BEAN GUY.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.912
NO, HE'S WATCHING THE
FOOTBALL GAME ON HIS LITTLE TV.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.615
THE MAN HAS
A SERIOUS GAMBLING PROBLEM.

05:53.001 --> 05:54.853
WELL, AS LONG AS HE'S
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.405
OK, EVERYBODY, IN THE
MEANTIME, HERE YOU GO.

05:57.473 --> 05:59.340
COME ON. SCOOP AND PASS.
SCOOP AND PASS!

05:59.408 --> 06:01.643
LET'S GO. MOVE IT ALONG.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.485
WOW,
HE LOOKS COLD.

06:10.552 --> 06:12.820
THEY SAY IT'S GONNA
GET BELOW 30 TONIGHT,

06:12.887 --> 06:14.788
NOT COUNTING WINDCHILL.

06:14.856 --> 06:17.508
IS THAT MAN
GOING TO FREEZE, DADDY?

06:17.576 --> 06:18.743
I DON'T KNOW, SON.

06:21.647 --> 06:24.482
NO! DON'T WORRY.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.916
I NOTICED
WHEN HE CAME INSIDE,

06:25.984 --> 06:28.185
HE HAD A WHOLE THERMAL THING
UNDERNEATH HIS CLOTHES.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.755
HE'S ACTUALLY WARMER OUT THERE
THAN WE ARE IN HERE.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.008
CARVE.

06:34.076 --> 06:35.326
OK, SO ENOUGH ABOUT HIM.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.561
LET'S ENJOY EACH OTHER'S
COMPANY, SHALL WE?

06:37.629 --> 06:39.831
YEAH. HEY, LET'S
CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

06:39.899 --> 06:43.034
UM, ANYONE SEEN THE NEW
WIM WENDERS FILM?

06:45.888 --> 06:48.105
<i>WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN
TALKING ABOUT THAT GUY.</i>

06:48.173 --> 06:50.324
MAN, HE GIVE ME
THE CREEPS.

06:50.392 --> 06:52.459
REALLY? I KIND OF THINK
HE'S CUTE.

06:52.528 --> 06:53.861
WHAT?!

06:53.929 --> 06:56.614
YEAH, WHEN I CAME IN, I SAW
THAT HE HAS A NICE SMILE,

06:56.681 --> 06:58.916
AND HIS EYE
IS SO BLUE.

07:00.885 --> 07:03.721
HEY, ANYONE SEE THE
THANKSGIVING PARADE THIS MORNING?

07:03.789 --> 07:05.056
SEE THAT ROCKETTE?

07:05.124 --> 07:07.391
SHE TOOK A NOSEDIVE RIGHT
OFF THE SIDE OF THE FLOAT.

07:07.459 --> 07:08.893
SO FUNNY.

07:08.961 --> 07:09.661
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

07:09.728 --> 07:10.845
I COULDN'T
STOP LAUGHING.

07:22.941 --> 07:25.109
HEY, TRY THE STUFFING.
NO RAISINS.

07:27.112 --> 07:28.079
WHAT?

07:28.147 --> 07:29.713
FIX THIS.
FIX WHAT?

07:29.781 --> 07:31.098
OK, IN CASE YOU
HAVEN'T NOTICED, IDIOT,

07:31.166 --> 07:33.500
EVERYBODY'S OBSESSED WITH
YOUR PORCH PAL OUT THERE.

07:33.568 --> 07:35.335
NOBODY'S EATING.
IT'S COMPLETELY AWKWARD.

07:35.403 --> 07:36.504
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO?

07:36.572 --> 07:37.505
THE GUY'S WAITING
FOR HIS BUDDY TO PICK HIM UP,

07:37.573 --> 07:38.973
HE'S GOT
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.743
THE ONLY OTHER OPTION IS
TO LET HIM WAIT INSIDE HERE.

07:41.810 --> 07:44.612
INSIDE? ARE YOU REALLY
THAT STUPID?

07:44.680 --> 07:46.847
<i>STUPID WITH KINDNESS.</i>

07:46.915 --> 07:49.250
DOUG, PLEASE, JUST
CLOSE THE CURTAINS THEN.

07:49.318 --> 07:51.068
I'M NOT DOING THAT.
IT'S RUDE.

07:51.136 --> 07:52.486
RUDE? OK, I'M SORRY.

07:52.554 --> 07:54.388
I GUESS I'M NOT UP TO SPEED
ON THE RULES OF ETIQUETTE

07:54.456 --> 07:57.424
INVOLVING
ONE-EYED PORCH PSYCHOS.

07:58.928 --> 08:00.678
NOW, LOOK,
I WORKED MY ASS OFF

08:00.746 --> 08:01.946
TO MAKE A NICE
THANKSGIVING MEAL,

08:02.013 --> 08:03.614
AND I WANT PEOPLE
TO ENJOY IT,

08:03.682 --> 08:05.015
SO YOU'RE GONNA
MARCH IN THERE,

08:05.083 --> 08:06.300
YOU'RE GONNA
CLOSE THE CURTAINS,

08:06.368 --> 08:07.468
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE A FUNNY JOKE

08:07.536 --> 08:08.636
TO GET EVERYBODY IN
A GOOD MOOD AGAIN, OK?

08:08.704 --> 08:09.870
NOW GO!

08:09.938 --> 08:11.739
FINE, BUT FOR THE RECORD,

08:11.807 --> 08:13.775
YOU'RE WAY SCARIER
THAN PATCHY.

08:16.295 --> 08:17.678
HEY, HOW'S IT GOIN'?

08:17.746 --> 08:18.813
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BRIGHT
IN HERE.

08:18.881 --> 08:21.115
GONNA CLOSE THE CURTAINS.

08:22.934 --> 08:24.218
HERE WE GO.

08:24.286 --> 08:25.720
ALL RIGHT.

08:25.788 --> 08:27.455
OK, THAT'S GOOD.

08:27.523 --> 08:30.925
AHEM,
HERE WE ARE.

08:30.993 --> 08:32.592
MIGHT AS WELL
GET THIS ONE, TOO.

08:32.660 --> 08:34.062
SURE.

08:34.129 --> 08:36.797
ALL RIGHT! WHO WANTS
SOME TURKEY NOW?

08:36.865 --> 08:38.698
SHOW OF DRUMSTICKS,
HUH?

08:47.259 --> 08:49.160
EVERYTHING IS SO DELICIOUS, CARRIE.

08:49.228 --> 08:50.294
IT'S SO GOOD.

08:50.362 --> 08:52.646
YEAH, AND FREE.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.366
YES, BUT TIPPING
IS APPRECIATED.

08:55.434 --> 08:56.901
PASS ME THE BROCCOLI,
PLEASE.

09:03.826 --> 09:07.295
WHAT A WONDERFULLY AWKWARD
THANKSGIVING YOU'VE CREATED.

09:07.363 --> 09:10.698
MAJOR! MAJOR, GET BACK TO THE TABLE!

09:10.765 --> 09:11.932
PLEASE DO SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR SON.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.401
HE JUST WANTS TO LOOK
AT THE FREAK OUTSIDE.

09:13.468 --> 09:14.702
WE ALL DO.

09:16.070 --> 09:17.371
JUST GET HIM
BACK HERE.

09:17.439 --> 09:19.440
MAJOR, YOU HEARD
YOUR MOTHER.

09:19.508 --> 09:20.341
MAJOR!

09:20.408 --> 09:22.910
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF THE PIRATE IS DEAD.

09:22.978 --> 09:24.662
HE'S NOT A PIRATE,
AND HE'S NOT DEAD.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.330
IS HE?

09:27.800 --> 09:31.435
OK, WHO'S READY FOR A SECOND
ROUND OF STUFFING? LOU?

09:31.503 --> 09:33.253
LOOK, IT'S NOT MY PLACE
TO SAY THIS,

09:33.322 --> 09:34.955
BUT HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
LETTING THAT MAN

09:35.023 --> 09:36.957
WAIT INSIDE THE HOUSE?

09:37.025 --> 09:38.259
INSIDE THE HOUSE.

09:38.327 --> 09:41.162
HUH. WHAT A KIND
AND GENEROUS THOUGHT.

09:42.481 --> 09:45.449
WE DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA, LOU.

09:45.517 --> 09:46.500
WHY NOT?

09:46.568 --> 09:47.935
WELL, BECAUSE WE'VE
NEVER MET THIS MAN BEFORE.

09:48.002 --> 09:49.570
FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE
COULD BE AN AX MURDERER.

09:49.638 --> 09:51.572
WHO NEEDS
ANOTHER ROLL?

09:51.639 --> 09:53.741
I WILL TAKE ONE,

09:53.808 --> 09:54.842
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

09:54.910 --> 09:56.177
I AGREE WITH YOU,
SISTER.

09:56.245 --> 09:57.328
YOU WORK
IN THE SUBWAY,

09:57.396 --> 09:58.563
YOU SEE
A LOT OF SICKOS,

09:58.630 --> 10:02.200
AND THIS GUY HAS MY
SPIDEY-SENSE TINGLING.

10:02.267 --> 10:03.968
REALLY?

10:04.035 --> 10:06.804
HE DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE A SICKO AT ALL TO ME,

10:06.871 --> 10:08.706
AND I'VE KNOWN
MY SHARE OF SICKOS.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.108
I STILL KEEP IN TOUCH
WITH SOME OF THEM.

10:11.176 --> 10:14.478
WELL, HOLLY, YOU MAKE
A PERSUASIVE CASE. YOU DO.

10:14.546 --> 10:17.248
UM, BUT WE'RE STILL
NOT GONNA LET HIM IN.

10:17.315 --> 10:19.834
OH! YOU FUMBLIN' BITCH!

10:19.902 --> 10:21.769
SORRY.

10:21.837 --> 10:23.370
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

10:24.940 --> 10:25.990
LISTEN, CAR,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

10:26.057 --> 10:27.624
I WOULDN'T LET A
RAGGEDY-LOOKING STRANGER

10:27.692 --> 10:29.160
IN MY HOUSE
ON THANKSGIVING.

10:29.227 --> 10:31.228
THANK YOU. SEE?
IT'S NOT JUST ME.

10:31.296 --> 10:33.063
LOU AND HOLLY,
THEY AGREE WITH ME.

10:33.131 --> 10:34.265
DEAC, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

10:34.332 --> 10:35.966
I MEAN, YOU'D BE OK
LETTING THIS GUY IN, RIGHT?

10:36.034 --> 10:37.451
WELL, IF HE WAS
A BROTHER I WOULD,

10:37.519 --> 10:39.753
BUT NOT THIS DUDE.

10:39.821 --> 10:41.972
ISN'T THAT
JUST A FORM OF RACISM?

10:42.040 --> 10:43.056
LOOK, I'M JUST LOOKING
AT THE FACTS.

10:43.124 --> 10:44.525
BLACK DUDE
MIGHT STEAL YOUR WALLET,

10:44.592 --> 10:46.027
BUT THE PSYCHOS
WHO CHOP UP FAMILIES?

10:46.094 --> 10:48.162
ALL WHITE BOYS.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.731
HONKIES! YES!

10:50.799 --> 10:52.400
ALL RIGHT,
THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS,

10:52.468 --> 10:53.834
I ASSUME THE BEST
ABOUT PEOPLE,

10:53.902 --> 10:55.236
YOU ASSUME THE WORST.

10:55.304 --> 10:57.838
YOU BUILD WALLS,
I BUILD BRIDGES.

10:59.608 --> 11:01.709
YOU COULDN'T BUILD
A TV STAND.

11:01.776 --> 11:03.944
THE INSTRUCTIONS
WERE IN JAPANESE.

11:04.012 --> 11:06.864
FACE IT, DOUG, YOU'RE
WAY OFF ON THIS ONE.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.449
I MEAN, DID YOU
GET A LOOK AT THIS GUY?

11:08.517 --> 11:11.118
I MEAN, THE WAY HE'S
DRESSED AND THE EYE PATCH?

11:11.185 --> 11:13.304
WHAT THE HELL DOES HIS EYE
PATCH HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

11:13.371 --> 11:15.907
MAYBE A MISSILE WAS HEADED
FOR AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

11:15.974 --> 11:17.742
AND HE THREW HIS EYE
IN THE WAY!

11:17.810 --> 11:20.211
IT WAS LIKE, ZZZ! "AAH!"

11:20.278 --> 11:21.478
MAN'S A HERO.

11:21.546 --> 11:23.831
I'M JUST SAYING A NORMAL
GUY WHO LOSES AN EYE,

11:23.898 --> 11:25.232
HE DOESN'T GO
WITH A PATCH.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.368
I MEAN, A GLASS EYE,
MAYBE,

11:27.436 --> 11:29.403
OR A PAIR
OF DARK RAY-BANS.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.372
I MEAN, YOU DON'T SEE
RAY CHARLES WALKING AROUND

11:31.440 --> 11:33.140
WEARING AN EYE PATCH,
DO YOU?

11:33.208 --> 11:35.143
ACTUALLY, HE WOULD
NEED 2 EYE PATCHES.

11:36.878 --> 11:38.929
THAT'S A BAD LOOK
RIGHT THERE.

11:38.997 --> 11:40.380
THINK ABOUT WHO WEARS
AN EYE PATCH-

11:40.448 --> 11:41.381
CAPTAIN HOOK,

11:41.449 --> 11:43.650
THE VILLAIN FROM
THE JAMES BOND MOVIE-

11:43.718 --> 11:45.119
ALL BAD GUYS.

11:45.187 --> 11:46.854
WHAT ABOUT BAZOOKA JOE?

11:46.921 --> 11:48.589
BAZOOKA JOE.
COULDN'T BE NICER.

11:48.657 --> 11:49.857
PLEASE! HAVE YOU READ
THOSE COMICS?

11:49.924 --> 11:51.225
HE'S VERY SARCASTIC.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.044
ALL RIGHT,
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

11:53.111 --> 11:55.413
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE GUY'S EYE PATCH.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.147
OK, MAYBE HE IS A NICE GUY

11:57.215 --> 11:59.366
WHO GOT A MISSILE
IN THE EYE, ALL RIGHT?

11:59.434 --> 12:01.068
BUT MAYBE HE'S NOT!

12:01.136 --> 12:04.171
AND IF THERE'S A 1% CHANCE THAT
HE COULD BE A DEMENTED KILLER,

12:04.239 --> 12:06.306
WHY SHOULD WE TAKE THE RISK?

12:06.374 --> 12:08.008
THE GUY IS FREEZING
OUT THERE, ALL RIGHT?

12:08.076 --> 12:09.476
<i>YOU WANT THE HEADLINE
IN THE POST TO READ TOMORROW,</i>

12:09.544 --> 12:12.646
"MAN DIES ON PORCH OF
HAPPY THANKSGIVING DINNER"?

12:12.714 --> 12:14.298
HOW ABOUT THIS
FOR A HEADLINE?

12:14.366 --> 12:16.567
"10 PEOPLE CARVED IN
THANKSGIVING MASSACRE."

12:16.635 --> 12:18.870
I MEAN,
IT WRITES ITSELF!

12:23.024 --> 12:24.291
OH, GOD, DO YOU
THINK HE HEARD US?

12:24.359 --> 12:28.479
EVEN SO, HOW WOULD HE KNOW
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HIM?

12:28.546 --> 12:31.482
MAYBE THE FACT THAT WE SAID
"EYE PATCH" ABOUT 600 TIMES.

12:34.936 --> 12:36.270
WHAT ARE YOU-
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

12:36.338 --> 12:37.605
I'M GONNA SEE
WHAT HE WANTS, OK?

12:37.673 --> 12:39.139
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
TO PRETEND WE'RE NOT HOME.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.874
ALL RIGHT, WELL, KEEP
THE CHAIN ON THE DOOR.

12:40.942 --> 12:43.244
YEAH, CAUSE' NO ONE CAN
GET THROUGH ONE OF THESE.

12:44.979 --> 12:46.046
YEAH?

12:46.114 --> 12:48.015
HEY, UH, ANY CHANCE
I COULD USE YOUR BATHROOM?

12:48.083 --> 12:49.383
OH, YEAH, SURE,
NO PROBLEM.

12:49.451 --> 12:51.135
ONE SECOND, PLEASE.
I'M IN MY BRA.

12:53.004 --> 12:55.406
OK, THIS IS
WHERE I DRAW THE LINE, OK?

12:55.473 --> 12:56.706
I'M NOT GONNA INSULT
THE MAN'S DIGNITY

12:56.774 --> 12:58.708
BY MAKING HIM TAKE A PEE
IN OUR BUSHES!

12:58.776 --> 13:00.577
WHY NOT? YOU DO.

13:00.645 --> 13:02.463
NOT IN THE FRONT!

13:02.531 --> 13:04.098
I'M LETTIN' HIM IN.

13:04.166 --> 13:04.865
OK, BUT WAIT A MINUTE.

13:04.933 --> 13:07.384
YOU FOLLOW HIM
UPSTAIRS,

13:07.452 --> 13:08.452
HE GOES TO THE BATHROOM,

13:08.520 --> 13:10.387
AND THEN HE'S RIGHT BACK
OUTSIDE, OK?

13:10.455 --> 13:12.856
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
KEEP EATING, LOOK NORMAL.

13:12.924 --> 13:13.924
HEY, MAN,
COME ON IN.

13:14.076 --> 13:15.142
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

13:15.210 --> 13:16.477
HEY, YOU GOT A NICE
LITTLE SETUP THERE, HUH?

13:16.545 --> 13:19.846
JUST SITTIN' THERE, WATCHIN'
THE PRETTY GIRLS WALK BY?

13:19.914 --> 13:21.298
IT'S AT THE TOP
OF THE STAIRS.

13:21.366 --> 13:22.466
GREAT.

13:22.534 --> 13:24.702
WHAT ARE YOU, BLIND?!

13:26.972 --> 13:29.573
UH... FOOTBALL REFEREE'S...

13:29.641 --> 13:30.974
BLIND.

13:31.042 --> 13:32.476
I LIKE YOUR COAT.

13:34.112 --> 13:36.763
I LIKE YOUR PANTS.
I'M HOLLY. HI!

13:36.831 --> 13:37.564
HI.

13:40.802 --> 13:42.303
OK. GO. GO!

13:42.370 --> 13:43.570
DEAC, YOU GO, TOO.
CHECK ON HIM.

13:43.638 --> 13:44.771
OK, OK.

13:49.311 --> 13:50.411
WHAT'S HE DOIN'?

13:52.147 --> 13:53.180
NUMBER ONE.

13:58.086 --> 14:00.020
JEEZ, WHAT'D HE HAVE,
A BIG GULP?

14:01.589 --> 14:04.091
NOW HE'S WASHIN' HIS HANDS.
HOW MANY PSYCHO KILLERS YOU KNOW

14:04.159 --> 14:05.492
WASH THEIR HANDS
AFTER THEY PEE?

14:05.560 --> 14:06.526
COULDN'T TELL YOU.

14:06.594 --> 14:07.761
HE'S COMIN'.

14:07.829 --> 14:09.363
UH, THERE. HOW'S THAT?

14:09.431 --> 14:10.531
IS THAT ANY BETTER?

14:10.598 --> 14:11.765
UH, UP A LITTLE
ON THE LEFT.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.134
ALL RIGHT,
THERE YOU GO.

14:13.201 --> 14:14.334
NOW, STOP WORRYIN'
ABOUT OUR PICTURES

14:14.402 --> 14:15.569
AND ENJOY
YOUR DINNER ALREADY.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.204
WELL, NOW I CAN.

14:25.780 --> 14:27.481
WELL,
THANKS A LOT.

14:27.549 --> 14:29.149
SORRY TO DISTURB
YOUR DINNER.

14:29.217 --> 14:30.868
WHAT? NO,
NO, NO, NO.

14:33.121 --> 14:34.688
HEY, MISTER. MISTER.

14:34.755 --> 14:36.056
MAJOR?
WHY DO YOU

14:36.124 --> 14:38.875
HAVE TO BE OUTSIDE?
ARE YOU A PIRATE?

14:38.943 --> 14:41.545
YES. YES,
I AM A PIRATE.

14:41.613 --> 14:44.515
I JUST CAME ASHORE FOR A
FEW DAYS TO FIX MY SHIP.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.217
CAN YOU FIX
MY GAME BOY?

14:46.284 --> 14:48.786
MAJOR, LEAVE THE MAN ALONE. HE'S...

14:48.853 --> 14:50.087
BUSY.

14:51.639 --> 14:52.673
LET ME SEE.

14:53.909 --> 14:55.409
OH, YOU MIGHT
JUST NEED TO POKE

14:55.476 --> 14:58.312
THE LITTLE RESET BUTTON
WITH SOMETHIN' SHARP.

14:58.379 --> 14:59.079
CA-

15:04.752 --> 15:06.687
THERE YOU GO.
GOOD AS NEW.

15:06.754 --> 15:07.855
THANKS.

15:12.844 --> 15:15.028
OK. WELL, I GUESS
I'LL GO BACK OUT THERE.

15:22.103 --> 15:23.904
ALL RIGHT, THIS
IS RIDICULOUS.

15:23.971 --> 15:25.906
THE GUY'S
OBVIOUSLY HARMLESS.

15:25.973 --> 15:27.541
YOU DON'T
KNOW THAT.

15:27.609 --> 15:29.760
HE JUST FIXED A CHILD'S GAME BOY
AND WASHED HIS HANDS AFTER MAKING.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.562
HOW MUCH PROOF
DO WE NEED?!

15:31.630 --> 15:33.613
HEY, NO AMOUNT OF PROOF
IS GONNA CHANGE MY GUT

15:33.681 --> 15:35.715
TELLIN' ME
THIS GUY ISN'T RIGHT.

15:35.783 --> 15:36.700
OH, WILL YOU
KNOCK IT OFF?

15:36.768 --> 15:38.068
IT'S NOT THIS GUY
YOU'RE SCARED OF.

15:38.136 --> 15:39.236
IT'S THE WHOLE WORLD!

15:39.303 --> 15:41.538
THAT'S WHY THE SUBWAY'S
A PERFECT JOB FOR YOU.

15:41.606 --> 15:43.173
YOU CAN HIDE IN YOUR
LITTLE GLASS BOOTH ALL DAY.

15:43.241 --> 15:44.608
DO THEY EVEN NEED
YOU, BY THE WAY,

15:44.676 --> 15:46.376
WITH THE WHOLE
METRO CARD THING?

15:46.444 --> 15:48.929
SHUT UP.
SHUT UP!

15:50.932 --> 15:52.366
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN'?

15:52.434 --> 15:53.467
YOU KNOW WHAT? IF WE'RE
NOT LETTING HIM IN HERE,

15:53.535 --> 15:54.668
I'M GOIN'
OUT THERE.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.053
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED

15:56.121 --> 15:57.087
ON THE FIRST THANKSGIVING. THE PILGRIMS

15:57.239 --> 15:58.706
DIDN'T KNOW THE
INDIANS, BUT THEY DECIDED

15:58.773 --> 16:01.007
TO TRUST THEM
AND BRING THEM FOOD.

16:01.075 --> 16:04.394
YES, AND THEN
THE INDIANS SCALPED THEM.

16:04.462 --> 16:07.681
I THINK YOU BOTH HAVE
THE STORY PRETTY WRONG.

16:07.748 --> 16:08.982
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE POINT IS,

16:09.050 --> 16:10.718
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA
DO THE RIGHT THING,

16:10.785 --> 16:12.986
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOIN'
- THE RIGHT THING.

16:13.054 --> 16:15.322
AND I DON'T CARE IF
I HAVE TO DO IT ALONE!

16:16.891 --> 16:18.425
DEAC, COULD YOU, UH, HELP
ME WITH THE DOOR HANDLES?

16:21.396 --> 16:22.362
THANK YOU!

16:23.831 --> 16:25.332
DO YOU WANT TO JUST GRAB MY JACKET? OH.

16:26.734 --> 16:27.667
YEAH.

16:27.735 --> 16:29.169
THANK YOU!

16:32.590 --> 16:34.392
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AGREE WITH DOUG.

16:34.459 --> 16:36.660
<i>I MEAN, IT REALLY IS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO,</i>

16:36.728 --> 16:40.864
AND I THINK WHEN YOU
HAVE A CHANCE TO DO...

16:40.932 --> 16:43.200
TO DO THE RIGHT THING,
YOU SHOULD DO IT. YOU KNOW?

16:43.268 --> 16:44.668
'CAUSE AT THE END
OF THE DAY,

16:44.736 --> 16:46.253
THE, UH...
THE RIGHT THING...

16:47.555 --> 16:49.256
IS RIGHT. OK.

16:51.159 --> 16:52.092
I'M JUST GONNA...

16:52.160 --> 16:54.228
TAKE THIS WINE
WITH ME, TOO.

16:54.295 --> 16:56.046
WE WANNA GO,
TOO, MAMA!

16:56.081 --> 16:58.365
YEAH! WE WANNA EAT
WITH THE PIRATE!

16:58.433 --> 16:59.666
NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

16:59.734 --> 17:01.368
DAD, CAN WE?

17:01.436 --> 17:04.371
UM... LOOK,
MAYBE IT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:04.439 --> 17:06.039
THAT MAN COULD BE DANGEROUS!

17:06.107 --> 17:08.208
I KNOW, BUT THEY'RE
JUST GONNA KEEP NAGGING.

17:11.112 --> 17:12.913
DEACON, THAT'S NOT
A GOOD ENOUGH REASON.

17:12.981 --> 17:14.481
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD
TAKE THEM OUT THERE. OK?

17:14.549 --> 17:16.550
I MEAN, LOOK, DO YOU WANT 'EM TO
GROW UP TO BE AFRAID OF THE WORLD?

17:16.617 --> 17:18.452
THEY COULD END UP
LIKE... LIKE...

17:18.519 --> 17:19.719
UHH...

17:23.308 --> 17:24.608
OK, COATS
AND MITTENS.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.377
YAY!
YAY!

17:26.444 --> 17:28.078
ALL RIGHT. BUT IF YOU GUYS GO OUTSIDE,

17:28.145 --> 17:31.298
YOU CAN SAY GOOD-BYE TO
DESSERTS. I'M SERIOUS.

17:33.968 --> 17:35.168
THEY'RE RIGHT.

17:36.604 --> 17:38.038
ALL OF THEM. I...

17:38.105 --> 17:40.207
<i>I AM AFRAID
OF THE WORLD.</i>

17:40.274 --> 17:43.510
I SIT BEHIND MY
BULLETPROOF GLASS EVERY DAY,

17:43.578 --> 17:47.180
ALL DAY, AND...
MY ONLY THOUGHT IS...

17:47.248 --> 17:50.016
<i>GOD, I HOPE THE GLASS
REALLY IS BULLETPROOF.</i>

17:53.120 --> 17:55.889
WELL, I'M THROUGH
LIVING IN FEAR!

17:55.956 --> 17:57.658
I'M GOING OUT THERE, DAMN IT!

18:00.895 --> 18:02.896
YOU'RE... COMING,
TOO, RIGHT, LOU?

18:04.899 --> 18:06.317
I HAVE TO FOLLOW
MY HEART.

18:06.384 --> 18:08.718
YEAH. FOLLOW YOUR
FRIGGIN' HEART, LOU.

18:11.072 --> 18:14.040
OH, COME ON, BABY!
GO! GO, GO, GO!

18:14.108 --> 18:16.760
NO ONE TO BEAT
BUT THE KICKER! GO!

18:16.828 --> 18:17.895
OH, MY GOD!

18:17.963 --> 18:20.497
HOW DO YOU GET TACKLED
BY A GUY FROM SWEDEN?!

18:25.236 --> 18:27.270
OHHH! GOD!

18:30.175 --> 18:31.175
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

18:32.944 --> 18:34.594
AHH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THEM. IT'S JUST YOU AND ME,

18:34.662 --> 18:36.396
DANNY BOY. WHAT DO YOU NEED? STUFFING?

18:36.464 --> 18:38.065
UH... BROCCOLI?

18:38.132 --> 18:40.034
NAH. JUST LOST A FORTUNE.

18:40.101 --> 18:41.902
NEED SOME AIR.

18:59.003 --> 19:00.537
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.457
LIVE AND LEARN, HUH? YEAH.

19:03.525 --> 19:05.992
UH, I... I HAVEN'T
SEEN 'EM FOR YEARS.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.061
UM... HI.

19:08.729 --> 19:12.766
I JUST WANTED TO TELL
YOU, MR. STRANGER...

19:12.833 --> 19:14.568
THAT I WAS THE,
UH, THE MAIN PERSON

19:14.636 --> 19:16.670
WHO DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO COME IN TONIGHT.

19:18.106 --> 19:21.375
I GUESS I'VE JUST NEVER
BEEN A... A TRUSTING PERSON.

19:21.443 --> 19:24.295
I'M ONE OF THOSE
FEW PEOPLE WHO, UM...

19:24.362 --> 19:26.930
ACTUALLY USES
THE ATM REARVIEW MIRROR.

19:28.733 --> 19:29.833
ANYWAY...

19:29.901 --> 19:32.185
IN THE TRUE SPIRIT
OF THANKSGIVING,

19:32.253 --> 19:34.455
<i>I'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU
INSIDE WITH US.</i>

19:35.657 --> 19:37.658
FOR THE REST OF OUR
DINNER, IF YOU'D LIKE.

19:39.427 --> 19:41.862
WELL, I... I DON'T,
UH... KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

19:41.929 --> 19:44.698
I MEAN... BEFORE
ANY OF YOU CAME OUT,

19:44.766 --> 19:46.900
I WAS THINKIN' ABOUT
HOW NICE YOU PEOPLE WERE...

19:46.968 --> 19:50.471
JUST TO LET A PERFECT STRANGER
USE YOUR PHONE AND YOUR BATHROOM

19:50.538 --> 19:52.373
AND TO WAIT OUT HERE
ON YOUR PORCH?

19:52.440 --> 19:54.975
I CERTAINLY NEVER
EXPECTED ANY OF THIS.

19:55.042 --> 19:58.545
I
- I'D JUST LOVE TO MAKE A TOAST TO YOU...

19:58.613 --> 20:00.146
A THANKSGIVING TOAST.

20:00.214 --> 20:01.115
THAT'D BE GREAT.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.600
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.968
WHOOPS. THERE'S MY
BUDDY'S CAR RIGHT NOW,

20:05.036 --> 20:06.503
STOPPIN' AT
THAT TRAFFIC LIGHT.

20:06.571 --> 20:08.288
I RECOGNIZE
THE BAD PAINT JOB.

20:09.590 --> 20:10.958
UH, WE GOT
A LONG DRIVE,

20:11.025 --> 20:12.759
SO IF I COULD JUST USE
YOUR BATHROOM ONE MORE TIME,

20:12.827 --> 20:14.260
THEN I'LL MAKE MY TOAST
AND BE ON MY WAY?

20:14.328 --> 20:15.929
OH. ABSOLUTELY.
SURE.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.731
I'LL GET THE WINE
POURED IN THE MEANTIME.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.099
CAN I HAVE SOME WINE?

20:19.167 --> 20:21.201
SURE YOU CAN...
IN ABOUT 14 YEARS.

20:26.407 --> 20:28.626
SEE? TURNS OUT
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

20:28.693 --> 20:31.462
AND YOU WANT TO HEAR
THE KICKER? JETS FAN. OH.

20:31.529 --> 20:33.696
HEY, HOLLY, DID YOU GET HIS NUMBER YET?

20:33.764 --> 20:35.432
UH, NO, NOT YET, BUT
WHEN HE COMES BACK OUT,

20:35.499 --> 20:38.102
IF YOU ALL COULD JUST TALK
AMONGST YOURSELVES... OHHH...

20:38.169 --> 20:39.569
YOU BAD GIRL.

20:39.637 --> 20:41.571
ALL I CAN SAY...
THIS HAS

20:41.639 --> 20:43.624
TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF
THE NICEST THANKSGIVINGS

20:43.691 --> 20:44.858
I'VE EVER HAD.

20:44.925 --> 20:46.242
OHHH...
OHHH...

20:47.595 --> 20:48.928
HEY, HERE COMES
HIS FRIEND.

20:48.996 --> 20:50.029
THE GUY
CAUGHT A BREAK.

20:50.097 --> 20:51.431
THERE'S A PARKING SPACE RIGHT IN FRONT.

21:09.283 --> 21:10.584
CRAP!

21:13.054 --> 21:15.222
HE GOT OUR SILVERWARE, OUR STEREO,

21:15.289 --> 21:17.708
HER PURSE, HER PURSE,
AND HIS LITTLE TV.

21:18.976 --> 21:21.044
TOLD YOU HE WOULDN'T KILL US.

21:26.584 --> 21:29.019
<i>I WILL WAIT FOR YOU.
I PROMISE.</i>

21:29.086 --> 21:31.872
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
UM...

21:32.940 --> 21:34.641
CAN I GET MY PURSE BACK?

21:35.305 --> 21:41.398
