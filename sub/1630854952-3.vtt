00:04.700 --> 00:06.528
I don't know,
I just never learned cursive.

00:06.528 --> 00:07.659
What? How?

00:07.659 --> 00:09.009
What does your signature
look like?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.488
- All caps.
- Wild.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.055
Come on, get out of there.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.120
Was I supposed to
leave it up there forever?

00:34.512 --> 00:38.081
I mean, I will, you know,
if you just tell me to.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.474
I'm an ally.

Noah's back in these streets.
Tony's back in these streets.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.717
The whole single squad
is back, baby.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.154
Whoa.

01:07.154 --> 01:09.895
But also, I am sorry
for y'all recent heartbreaks.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.419
No need to apologize.

01:11.419 --> 01:14.030
The past couple weeks have been
a little rough at home,

01:14.030 --> 01:15.205
but I recently realized something.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.207
You can't be sad at home

01:17.207 --> 01:18.991
if you're never at home
to get sad.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.732
So you're what?
Just out all day?

01:20.732 --> 01:23.257
Yeah, I'm not going back home
until I'm over Simone.

01:23.257 --> 01:25.041
What does your therapist
think about all of this?

01:25.041 --> 01:27.087
I'll catch him up next week
when I'm all better, bro.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.914
Okay, Noah. Do your thing.

01:28.914 --> 01:31.700
Anthony, how are you doing
since things ended with Talia?

01:31.700 --> 01:34.529
Oh, I'm good.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.574
He hasn't said a word about
the breakup to anyone.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.837
Look, Anthony and I,
we built different.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.143
We move on.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.579
I've seen him deal
with breakups before.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.451
If he says he's good,
he's good.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.714
Actual and factual.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.803
And you know who
you need to move on with?

01:47.803 --> 01:50.022
Neighbor bae.
- Okay, who's neighbor bae?

01:50.022 --> 01:51.763
Oh, this hot girl
who lives in their building.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.896
They've never talked to her.
They know nothing about her.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.985
That's a lie.
We know her and Anthony

01:55.985 --> 01:57.769
have undeniable chemistry.

02:03.601 --> 02:06.430
That's all that happened?
She waved?

02:06.430 --> 02:09.346
You had to be there.
It was a very sexual wave.

02:11.566 --> 02:15.222
So Fay, you're single,
and Anthony's single.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.614
Yeah, so?

02:16.614 --> 02:18.747
So you think you two
gonna ever, you know?

02:18.747 --> 02:21.228
Nicky, this is unlike you.
Let me take it from here.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.272
Y'all gonna [bleep]?

02:22.272 --> 02:23.447
Thanks, Wyatt.

02:23.447 --> 02:24.840
You guys need to chill.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.016
Being Anthony's rebound
would be way too messy.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.800
Plus, I'm still looking
for a rebound myself.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.106
Rebound?

02:30.106 --> 02:31.325
Are you telling me

02:31.325 --> 02:33.240
that you haven't had sex
since your divorce?

02:33.240 --> 02:35.198
Shh, keep it down.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.243
That is not
that big of a deal.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.287
How long you been divorced?

02:37.287 --> 02:39.289
- 18 months.
- Oh, my God!

02:39.289 --> 02:41.683
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

02:41.683 --> 02:43.815
With all the batteries
you been wasting? Damn.

02:43.815 --> 02:46.949
I know. It's terrible, but...

02:46.949 --> 02:49.473
I don't know. All the guys
I dated, they're just too nice.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.954
I had a really great time.
- I did, too,

02:51.954 --> 02:54.304
which is why I'm not
gonna kiss you or touch you

02:54.304 --> 02:57.177
or make any moves
because I respect you.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.614
You're not gonna like this,

02:59.614 --> 03:01.311
but you need the opposite
of a nice guy.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.617
You don't mean...

03:02.617 --> 03:04.488
Oh, yes.
I mean a jerk.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.011
Le douchebag.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.231
A purebred dog.

03:08.231 --> 03:09.841
I think you might be right.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.756
Damn.
- Yeah.

03:11.756 --> 03:14.672
Let's get you a big dog.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.199
Yo, Anthony,
what's wrong with you, man?

03:19.199 --> 03:20.548
Did you hear my question?

03:20.548 --> 03:22.680
Sorry. I was just responding
to a work email.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.465
What'd you ask?
- I said,

03:24.465 --> 03:26.249
you think LeBron James
is happy?

03:26.249 --> 03:28.860
Like truly happy?

03:28.860 --> 03:30.035
I do, actually.

03:30.035 --> 03:31.994
Cool.
Me too.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.996
Neighbor bae, neighbor bae,

03:33.996 --> 03:35.432
neighbor bae, neighbor bae.
- Chill. I see her.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.003
- Another sexual wave.
- Chill.

03:41.003 --> 03:41.960
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.135
What's up?

03:43.135 --> 03:44.528
I don't think
we've officially met.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.226
I'm Lanice.
- I'm Anthony.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.098
I'm Big Sherm.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.882
My roommate and I are
actually having a party

03:50.882 --> 03:52.884
at our place tonight.
You should come through.

03:52.884 --> 03:56.061
Uh, that sounds awesome,
but, um, I can't make it.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.324
I have work.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.891
Well, if you get done
with your work,

03:59.891 --> 04:00.849
maybe I'll see you.

04:06.724 --> 04:09.118
- Man, what--what was that for?
- You know what it was for.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.731
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, boo.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.255
Aw, hey, babe.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.082
Thank you so much for
letting me crash at your place.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.910
My apartment's plumbing
will be fixed in about a week,

04:18.910 --> 04:21.435
but I just can't stay
any longer with this fool.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.263
Call me fool one more time
and see what happens.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.394
Ain't nothing gonna happen,

04:24.394 --> 04:25.395
or it already
would've happened.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.396
Then say it again.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.529
Say fool one more time.

04:33.534 --> 04:36.232
Whatever.
I'ma get my bags.

04:36.232 --> 04:39.061
Holy [bleep].
That was wild.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.932
Yeah, you really saved me
by taking him in.

04:40.932 --> 04:43.065
Speaking of which, are you sure
that you want to take him in?

04:43.065 --> 04:45.763
Yeah, it's only for a week,
and he's my boyfriend.

04:45.763 --> 04:48.244
Well, living together
forces you to compromise,

04:48.244 --> 04:52.596
and you two, I'm sorry to say,
are very uncompromising people.

04:52.596 --> 04:53.989
Do you want me
to take him or not?

04:53.989 --> 04:55.773
I do. I do.
Forget everything I just said.

04:55.773 --> 04:56.905
Thank you.

04:56.905 --> 04:59.821
Michael, get your ass
down here! Damn!

05:03.215 --> 05:05.609
All settled in, my boo.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.045
Is it cool if
I play some video games?

05:07.045 --> 05:08.786
Oh, yeah, sure. I'm just
knocking out some work.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.788
Go play your little Nintendo.
- You're the best.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.094
No, you're the best.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.662
- No, you're the best.
- No, you're the best.

05:14.662 --> 05:17.317
No, you're the best.

05:19.362 --> 05:22.322
Uh-oh. What are you doing?
- Huh?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.281
Oh, it's a VR system,
so I just some space to play.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.631
Is that a problem?
- Oh, um...

05:27.631 --> 05:29.285
Of course not.

05:38.903 --> 05:41.123
Let's go!

05:41.123 --> 05:42.385
Flank him!

05:43.995 --> 05:46.389
I can't believe
you turned down Neighbor Bae

05:46.389 --> 05:48.391
after we finally learned
her real name.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.001
Yet you still call her
"Neighbor Bae."

05:50.001 --> 05:51.263
I don't use
anybody's real name

05:51.263 --> 05:52.395
the first year I meet them.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.396
I used to call you
"Veggie Burger."

05:53.396 --> 05:54.919
And I really
didn't like that.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.444
Look, I'm sorry,
but you can still go tonight.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.489
And be known as
the weird neighbor

05:59.489 --> 06:01.186
that shows up to a party
by himself?

06:01.186 --> 06:02.449
You'd really do that to me?

06:04.102 --> 06:05.843
Look, I can help you
with your work.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.845
I'm a quick study,
and I know numbers.

06:07.845 --> 06:11.632
5, 12, 3.1415926--
- You know what?

06:11.632 --> 06:13.068
I'm in.
- Really?

06:13.068 --> 06:15.679
- Yes.
- Hey, let's get it, Veggie B.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.464
- Hey.
- Veggie B, Veggie B, Veggie B.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.421
That's me.
both: Veggie B, Veggie B,

06:18.421 --> 06:19.596
Veggie B, that's me.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.000
- Yo.
- Yo.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.305
I'm done with work.
You still want to party?

06:33.305 --> 06:34.481
- Definitely.
- Cool.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.048
Let me call Noah and Wyatt.
- Word.

06:37.048 --> 06:40.225
- Yo.
- Yo.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.836
Party tonight
at Neighbor Bae's.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.141
Want to come?
- I'm in.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.100
As long as it's out,
you know I'm in.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.536
Can you pick me up
at Calabasas?

06:46.536 --> 06:48.277
You walked all the way
to Calabasas?

06:48.277 --> 06:49.844
You know it.

Hi-yah!

07:36.760 --> 07:39.067
My brother in arms,

07:39.067 --> 07:44.855
together, we will save Nebulon!

07:44.855 --> 07:46.727
Michael, please.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.164
Damn, wow. How'd I get
all the way over here?

07:49.164 --> 07:51.427
This really is
an immersive experience.

07:51.427 --> 07:56.084
Hey, do you mind being just
a little bit more quiet

07:56.084 --> 07:58.260
while you defend Newbulars?

07:58.260 --> 07:59.435
It's Nebulon, and the game is

07:59.435 --> 08:01.132
"Nebulon Nine:
The Last Nebuli."

08:01.132 --> 08:02.960
And it's awesome.
- Cool.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.962
Oh, I see.
You're annoyed.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.877
No, I'm not annoyed.

08:06.877 --> 08:10.925
Um, I think I'm trying to say
that the game is dumb,

08:10.925 --> 08:12.535
loud, and...
- Wow.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.276
I hate this part
of your personality.

08:14.276 --> 08:15.277
All right,
well, you know what?

08:15.277 --> 08:16.670
The only way to resolve this

08:16.670 --> 08:18.846
is for you to enter
"Nebulon Nine."

08:18.846 --> 08:20.195
Oh, no. I don't have time.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.326
- But, Nicole.
- What?

08:21.326 --> 08:23.503
The entire unified intergalactic

08:23.503 --> 08:25.548
tribunal diaspora
depends on you.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.768
They definitely don't.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.421
Just play the game,
and if you don't like it,

08:29.421 --> 08:31.206
I won't play it
for as long as I'm here.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.121
- Mm.
- Come on.

08:33.121 --> 08:37.604
Prepare for
intergalactic battle!

08:37.604 --> 08:40.563
Babe, you just united
the entire Rack-Nack Galaxy.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.696
That's so freakin' hot.
- Yeah?

08:42.696 --> 08:43.958
Oh, yeah.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.786
- Oh, come here.
- Oh, ooh.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.439
- I want to pick up your leg.
- Oh, yeah.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.659
- Oh, oh.
- Oh, yeah.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.401
Thanks for meeting me at such
a late hour at the last second

08:52.401 --> 08:53.707
around the corner
from our spot.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.447
I'm sorry I didn't respond
to your text

08:55.447 --> 08:56.536
until, like, 30 minutes ago.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.711
Oh, it's fine.
You're perfect.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.976
Nice and you're,
like... cool body.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.412
Thanks.

09:03.412 --> 09:06.067
Um, would you want
to get out of here, actually?

09:06.067 --> 09:07.677
For real?
Just like that?

09:07.677 --> 09:10.593
- Yeah. Is that weird?
- No, it's great.

09:10.593 --> 09:13.030
Almost too great.
Who put you up to this?

09:13.030 --> 09:14.249
What?

09:14.249 --> 09:15.206
It was my girlfriend,
wasn't it?

09:15.206 --> 09:16.512
You have a girlfriend?

09:16.512 --> 09:18.383
Uh-uh, you're not fooling me.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.647
You can tell Monica
I passed the test this time.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.214
What?

09:25.521 --> 09:27.610
I'm just gonna say it.
There are not enough chairs

09:27.610 --> 09:28.959
for the amount of people
in this party.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.395
Are you really already
complaining about a party

09:30.395 --> 09:31.919
that you begged me to go to?

09:31.919 --> 09:34.269
I'm just saying, people need
to have a place to sit.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.706
Okay, who wants a drink?

09:36.706 --> 09:37.620
Noah.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.665
What's up?
Y'all sleeping?

09:38.665 --> 09:41.624
No, you were sleeping,
standing up.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.670
Maybe you should go home.
- No.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.194
Home is where the heart is,
and right now, heart hurts.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.848
I'm out, baby.
I'ma take a nap.

09:47.848 --> 09:51.025
I mean, a lap.
I'ma take a lap.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.287
Should we be worried
about him?

09:52.287 --> 09:54.071
No. We worry about Noah
all the damn time.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.507
Let him figure this one out.

09:55.507 --> 09:56.683
So you guys just
gonna be weird

09:56.683 --> 09:58.206
and stand in the corner
all night?

09:58.206 --> 09:59.337
Well, we ain't
got a place to sit.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.252
I was actually about
to grab a drink.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.515
Can I get you one?
- I'll come with.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.825
It's happening.
It's actually happening, Wyatt.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.044
Why are you so surprised?

10:10.044 --> 10:11.088
I thought you said
that there was a vibe.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.221
I lied.
There was no vibe at all,

10:13.221 --> 10:16.877
but now, it's real.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.139
What's wrong?

10:18.139 --> 10:19.575
I was cleaning
my wedding ring earlier,

10:19.575 --> 10:21.098
and I forgot to put it back on.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.404
Okay, so what's the big deal?

10:22.404 --> 10:24.275
The big deal is that
all these single women

10:24.275 --> 10:25.625
are gonna think that
I'm back on the market.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.757
I have married swag,
and without the ring,

10:27.757 --> 10:28.889
it's just swag.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.238
You dramatic.
That ain't a thing.

10:30.238 --> 10:33.633
Hey. I'm Alexis.
What your name?

10:36.592 --> 10:41.249
- Rosé for the lady.
- Oh, thanks.

10:41.249 --> 10:42.424
Oh, what's this?

10:42.424 --> 10:43.773
One of those fake-ass
reality shows?

10:43.773 --> 10:46.123
"Immediately Married"
is not fake.

10:46.123 --> 10:47.734
They really get married immediately.

10:47.734 --> 10:51.476
Mm. Sounds horrible.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.696
I seem to remember
someone saying,

10:53.696 --> 10:56.612
"You can't make fun of it
until you try it."

10:56.612 --> 10:58.440
You talking about
the man in the mirror, huh?

10:58.440 --> 11:01.356
Yeah. I'm asking for him
to make a change.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.750
<i>To immediately have and hold</i>

11:03.750 --> 11:06.753
<i>through immediate sickness
and immediate health</i>

11:06.753 --> 11:08.755
<i>till death do you
immediately part.</i>

11:08.755 --> 11:12.497
<i>- I immediately do.
- I immediately do.</i>

11:12.497 --> 11:14.804
- I love this show.
<i>- Immediately.</i>

11:14.804 --> 11:17.851
I can't believe Pauline
wants five kids.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.287
Really? I think five is,

11:19.287 --> 11:20.767
like, the perfect
amount of kids.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.725
You can have a band.
You can have a basketball team.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.467
The Jackson Five,
that's five kids.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.338
How many kids you want?
- Two.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.776
I like things in twos,
like shoes, boobs,

11:29.776 --> 11:31.038
the Olsen Twins,

11:31.038 --> 11:32.735
the "Sister Act" movies.
- I guess that means

11:32.735 --> 11:35.085
we're on kind of
different pages here, huh?

11:35.085 --> 11:36.260
Yeah.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.873
How about this?

11:39.873 --> 11:41.526
Four kids.
- Four kids?

11:41.526 --> 11:44.791
All right, that's
two sets of two, okay?

11:44.791 --> 11:46.706
And if we want to do the band
or the basketball team,

11:46.706 --> 11:48.969
I can just hop in.
I can play hoop.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.535
I can play bass.
- Yeah.

11:50.535 --> 11:54.365
- I can be the fifth member.
- Two kids, two spare kids.

11:54.365 --> 11:57.629
I'm in.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.806
Can I get your number?

11:59.806 --> 12:02.373
I'm sorry, I'm married.

12:02.373 --> 12:05.507
Hey, what's your story?

12:05.507 --> 12:08.640
Look at my man, using
a tiny-ass table as a chair.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.426
It's a tragedy.
- Yo, Sherm.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.994
This is Lanice's roommate, CJ,
and her girlfriend Gabby.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.473
Hey. Nice to meet you, Sherm.

12:15.473 --> 12:18.694
CJ, nice to meet you.
So this is your place, huh?

12:18.694 --> 12:20.174
And you've never thrown
a party before.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.523
- What?
- Nothing.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.003
You need more chairs.
- A group of us

12:23.003 --> 12:24.874
are gonna hit up this
karaoke spot that's open 24/7

12:24.874 --> 12:26.310
'cause, you know,
I ain't going home.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.616
You want to roll?
- No, man.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.183
I'ma go home and sit down.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.358
All right, bet.
Peace, dude.

12:30.358 --> 12:31.794
Good night, y'all.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.189
I'm getting too much
attention without my ring.

12:35.189 --> 12:38.670
I got to get out of here.
- Hey. Hey.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.150
All right, man.
I'm down to roll.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.718
- Okay, I'll get Anthony.
- No. Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.764
Why y'all always got
to act so damn married?

12:44.764 --> 12:47.201
You don't interrupt a man
when he's in his element.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.550
I got this.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.770
<i>♪ Boy, are you trippin'</i>

13:10.311 --> 13:11.268
They gonna hook up.
We're good to go.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.443
Okay.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.537
Yo, can you believe
Noah is in Reno?

13:19.537 --> 13:22.802
<i>Seven! Yeah, this is way
better than being home!</i>

13:23.846 --> 13:25.500
Man, stop using
Noah's crazy ass

13:25.500 --> 13:27.632
to distract from telling me
what happened with Neighbor Bae

13:27.632 --> 13:29.025
last night.
Give me the juice.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.288
Oh, no, no, no.
I'd rather not talk about it.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.290
Oh, come on, man.
I don't need a full cup.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.291
Just give me one little

13:34.291 --> 13:36.032
spot of tea please.
- Fine.

13:36.032 --> 13:38.339
So things started out good.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.820
Party was winding down and then
she asked me to go to her room.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.259
<i>Then it was on.</i>
- My man.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.304
I just told you
it doesn't end well.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.176
I'm sorry.
I'm just invested in

13:49.176 --> 13:51.961
the ups and downs of the story.
Now, what went wrong?

13:51.961 --> 13:55.356
Well, eventually
as we were hooking up,

13:55.356 --> 13:58.228
the music switched to
a very particular song.

13:58.228 --> 14:02.754
<i>♪ Never thought
that we would ever be ♪</i>

14:02.754 --> 14:04.931
<i>♪ More than friends</i>

14:04.931 --> 14:06.280
Oh, no.
That's a breakup anthem.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.629
Well, I tried
to push through,

14:07.629 --> 14:09.761
but eventually the song
just got the best of me,

14:09.761 --> 14:11.372
and my emotions just came out.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.765
Oh, damn.
So you cried in front of her.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.855
No, no, I cried,

14:15.855 --> 14:18.814
but I didn't cry
in front of her.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.251
I--I don't understand.

14:21.251 --> 14:25.212
Okay. Um... ah.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.170
You know how
when you go to the bakery,

14:27.170 --> 14:28.911
you typically order
your pastries

14:28.911 --> 14:30.260
at the front counter?

14:30.260 --> 14:31.740
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, yeah, I know,

14:31.740 --> 14:33.742
but if the baker
really likes you,

14:33.742 --> 14:36.310
then sometimes, they'll invite
you to the kitchen.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.659
Hmm.

14:37.659 --> 14:40.923
To taste some
special pastries in the back.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.360
Oh. Oh. Oh.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.971
Oh.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.450
So you was eating
in the back of the bakery.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.931
Yes. I was eating
in the back of the bakery.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.455
Yeah.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.674
Wait a second.

14:52.674 --> 14:53.936
Does that mean...

14:53.936 --> 14:55.459
You cried
in the back of the bakery?

14:55.459 --> 14:56.765
You told everybody?

14:56.765 --> 14:58.332
You couldn't expect me
to keep this a secret.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.073
It's too good.
- Whatever.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.552
Can we please stop
talking about this now?

15:01.552 --> 15:03.859
No. I have so many more
follow-up questions.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.556
- Yeah.
- Same.

15:05.556 --> 15:08.211
Like what did she say and how
did this whole situation end?

15:08.211 --> 15:10.126
Well, I didn't
technically end it.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.127
- How?
- What?

15:11.127 --> 15:12.302
If I left the kitchen,

15:12.302 --> 15:14.130
she would have known
something was up.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.958
So you stayed
in the back of the bakery?

15:15.958 --> 15:17.568
Yes, I stayed
in the back of the bakery.

15:17.568 --> 15:18.874
And she didn't notice?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.484
I mean, I don't think
I would notice.

15:20.484 --> 15:21.964
There's no way to see
what's going on back there.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.531
You know what?
I'm actually surprised.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.925
I never took you for a "back
of the bakery" type of dude.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.057
- You guys aren't?
- Ooh, I only visit

15:28.057 --> 15:29.972
the back of the bakery
on special occasions,

15:29.972 --> 15:32.583
like birthdays,
the Queen's funeral...

15:32.583 --> 15:33.758
I don't want to get
too deep into

15:33.758 --> 15:35.325
my relationship with Kristen,

15:35.325 --> 15:37.893
but I will say I have never
cried while eating [bleep].

15:37.893 --> 15:40.330
Okay, we're done here.

15:41.766 --> 15:44.682
So Fay, how was your date
last night with the dog?

15:44.682 --> 15:45.857
Did you get some?

15:45.857 --> 15:47.859
Nope, he thought
it was a trap.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.862
Hey, just wanted to tell you
that the cab you recommended?

15:50.862 --> 15:52.516
Fantastic.
- Oh, the Argentinian?

15:52.516 --> 15:54.910
Yeah, it was delicious.
Full body.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.346
Excuse me.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.696
How would feel about going
on a date with my friend?

15:58.696 --> 15:59.828
- Nicky.
- What?

15:59.828 --> 16:01.525
- Sorry about her.
- No, it's cool.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.353
I would love to, but...
- You're married.

16:03.353 --> 16:06.704
No. I'm very single,
but I'm not from here.

16:06.704 --> 16:07.923
And I leave town tomorrow,

16:07.923 --> 16:09.751
and I don't think
I'll ever be coming back.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.622
- Really?
- Perfect.

16:13.276 --> 16:14.712
Just breathe. Listen to me.

16:14.712 --> 16:15.931
Take the next flight out.

16:15.931 --> 16:18.412
Call me when you land, okay?
Yup. Bye.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.109
Oh, fun story.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.676
My brother had
a nervous breakdown

16:21.676 --> 16:23.330
at the Grand Canyon.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.419
It be like that sometimes.

16:25.419 --> 16:28.117
Yo, this cheesesteak
is about to be banging.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.205
I ain't had a Steak-umm
in a minute.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.902
I know.
It's a classic, right?

16:30.902 --> 16:32.252
Chop up the meat, babe.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.688
Oh, no, you don't have
to chop up a Steak-umm.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.951
What? That's what makes
a cheesesteak a cheesesteak.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.257
You chop up the meat.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.345
No. What makes a cheesesteak
a cheesesteak

16:38.345 --> 16:40.042
is the cheese on the steak, okay?

16:40.042 --> 16:41.739
Who doesn't chop up
a Steak-umm?

16:41.739 --> 16:43.654
Okay, well,
now it's about to get silly,

16:43.654 --> 16:44.960
and we don't wanna have
a fight here.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.179
- No.
- And we know how to deal

16:46.179 --> 16:48.007
with it, so
we're just gonna do it my way.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.617
Absolutely not.
We'll do it my way.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.010
I would rather die.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.622
Okay.

16:54.622 --> 16:55.710
Compromise here.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.842
We'll just bust open
another pack.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.409
Make one your way,
make one my way.

16:59.409 --> 17:02.934
No, that's a waste of food
and money.

17:02.934 --> 17:06.068
- Money's meant to be spent.
- Do you not have savings?

17:06.068 --> 17:07.243
What?
Absolutely not.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.505
We could all die tomorrow.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.812
Cash is worthless
in the casket.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.031
Look it up.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.033
I can't marry someone
without savings.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.251
Marry? Who said anything
about marriage?

17:15.251 --> 17:17.166
I am never getting married.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.429
We just had a conversation
about having four kids.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.083
You can have four kids
and not be married.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.432
Just ask my buddy Pookie.

17:22.432 --> 17:23.825
Just chop up
the damn Steak-umm.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.087
Oh, now, we yellin', huh?

17:25.087 --> 17:28.047
We been yellin'.
You wanna know what else?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.571
"Nebulon Nine" sucks.

17:32.225 --> 17:35.358
Say that again,
and it's immediately over.

17:38.318 --> 17:41.277
"Nebulon Nine"...

17:41.277 --> 17:43.062
sucks!

17:44.541 --> 17:47.414
Wow.

17:47.414 --> 17:48.719
That's what's up.
- So that's what's up.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.637
Man, I'm sorry
for encouraging you

17:53.637 --> 17:54.725
and Neighbor Bae.
I feel like everything

17:54.725 --> 17:55.596
that's happened
has been my fault.

17:55.596 --> 17:56.858
No. None of it
was your fault.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.947
To be honest,
the breakup with Talia and I

17:58.947 --> 18:00.470
was a bit more complicated
than I let on.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.298
How so?

18:02.298 --> 18:04.170
Well, uh...

18:04.170 --> 18:06.955
she found out that
Fay had feelings for me,

18:06.955 --> 18:09.914
and then I admitted
that at a certain point,

18:09.914 --> 18:12.395
I had feelings for Fay too.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.918
Wow.

18:13.918 --> 18:16.356
Okay, so what's up?
You still got feelings for Fay?

18:16.356 --> 18:17.966
I think she's great,

18:17.966 --> 18:20.186
but my feelings were before
Talia and I got together,

18:20.186 --> 18:22.579
and honestly, going through
this situation, man,

18:22.579 --> 18:24.364
made me realize that

18:24.364 --> 18:29.151
getting involved with a friend
is just a bad idea.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.631
That's real.

18:30.631 --> 18:31.980
Well, hey, man,

18:31.980 --> 18:34.374
you know, you can always come
and talk to me.

18:34.374 --> 18:37.986
I appreciate that. Thanks.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.119
Oh, and just as a heads up,

18:40.119 --> 18:41.468
I'm gonna give this
about two weeks,

18:41.468 --> 18:43.644
but after that,

18:43.644 --> 18:45.167
I'm gonna roast you nonstop.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.996
Bro, you've already
roasted me so much.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.302
I know.

18:52.957 --> 18:55.830
- This was fun.
- It really was.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.789
So if I'm being honest,
I really want to hook up,

18:58.789 --> 19:00.443
but I'm not looking
for a commitment.

19:00.443 --> 19:04.839
I leave the city tonight,
so that sounds good to me.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.188
Great.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.499
- You're so sexy.
- You're so sexy.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.849
So...

19:14.849 --> 19:17.721
can I eat a little piece
of your skin?

19:17.721 --> 19:19.680
- What?
- I mean, not important skin.

19:19.680 --> 19:23.031
You know, just the extra stuff.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.860
Let me exfoliate you.
- Oh.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.602
Wait. He really said that?

19:28.602 --> 19:30.125
He really did.

19:30.125 --> 19:34.216
Oh, man.
People be cannibals out here.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.436
So how are you doing?

19:36.436 --> 19:38.220
Mm.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.657
You know, I actually wanna talk
to you about that.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.746
I've been holding in a lot.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.401
And then I talked to Sherm,
and it made me realize

19:45.401 --> 19:48.187
how much better it felt
to talk things out.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.755
So I thought
I should let you know

19:51.755 --> 19:55.019
that Talia and I broke up
because of you.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.282
What?

19:56.282 --> 19:58.066
She found out that
you had feelings for me,

19:58.066 --> 20:00.373
and then she asked me
if I had feelings for you.

20:00.373 --> 20:04.420
And I didn't want to lie,
so I told her that I used to.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.728
Then she ended things.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.208
Why would you tell me that?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.340
I thought it would be better
to be open and honest.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.689
For who?

20:12.689 --> 20:14.561
What, am I supposed
to feel bad now?

20:14.561 --> 20:15.779
No, no.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.041
Are you telling me
that you like me?

20:17.041 --> 20:19.348
I just didn't want things
to be weird.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.263
Well, they're weird now.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.491
Nicky, what you doing here?

20:31.491 --> 20:33.754
Michael and I broke up.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.973
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

20:35.973 --> 20:38.715
Yeah.
You were right.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.543
Neither of us was willing
to compromise.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.589
We're two
very hardheaded people,

20:42.589 --> 20:44.286
but we're both better off.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.810
Well, I'm glad then,
but why'd you come all the way

20:46.810 --> 20:48.377
over here to tell me that?
Oh, my God, no.

20:48.377 --> 20:49.596
Hey, what's up, bro?

20:49.596 --> 20:51.467
I'm just gonna set up
in the same room.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.078
I am so sorry, Wyatt.

20:54.078 --> 20:56.429
I just really wanted it
to work.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.605
I loved him living with you.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.956
I know, but you...

21:01.956 --> 21:03.436
you're gonna make it
through this.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.176
See you later.

21:05.176 --> 21:07.222
- Nicky, don't leave.
- Sorry.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.450
Oh. Hi.

21:17.450 --> 21:21.367
Hey.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.412
Did you cry in my...

21:23.412 --> 21:24.761
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:24.761 --> 21:26.894
<i>Not a doctor. Shh.</i>
