00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.610 --> 00:12.711
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.713 --> 00:14.980
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.982 --> 00:17.716
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.718 --> 00:20.052
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:20.054 --> 00:22.688
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.690 --> 00:25.557
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.559 --> 00:29.528
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.530 --> 00:33.565
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.567 --> 00:36.568
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.570 --> 00:38.237
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.239 --> 00:40.672
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.674 --> 00:43.075
¶ Sofia ¶

00:43.077 --> 00:45.577
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.579 --> 00:51.750
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:06.434 --> 01:08.167
Oh, this is so frustrating.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.202
I've been waiting
for this day all year,

01:10.204 --> 01:11.737
and now it's ruined!

01:11.739 --> 01:13.405
What's so special
about today?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.908
Tonight is
the Minotaur meteor shower.

01:15.910 --> 01:18.010
It's the biggest
meteor shower of the year.

01:18.012 --> 01:19.578
A meteor shower?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.780
You mean shooting stars?
Can I watch with you, Amber?

01:21.782 --> 01:23.749
Not unless these clouds
go away.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.051
What if we went sailing
to find clear skies?

01:26.053 --> 01:27.786
Look out
in the distance.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.755
Oh, the Cloudless Sea.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.757
Great idea, Sofia.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.392
The skies are
always clear there.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.694
- Let's go ask Mom.
- Oh, do we have to?

01:35.696 --> 01:38.397
Of course. I'm sure
she'll say yes.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.599
No. Absolutely not.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.569
- No?
- Told you so.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.604
No matter what I ask,
she always says no.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.040
Amber, wait.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.442
Mom, she really wants to see
the Minotaur meteor shower.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.145
It only comes
one night a year.

01:53.147 --> 01:56.048
I'm sorry, but
I can't let you go
on a sailing trip

01:56.050 --> 01:58.750
by yourselves
at night.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.986
But we're older now,
and much more experienced.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.821
We've been on
lots of adventures.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.224
I think we can handle
a little sailing trip.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.658
( laughs )

02:06.660 --> 02:08.794
You're not as grown up
as you think.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.063
- But Mom...
- I'm sorry Sofia.

02:11.065 --> 02:14.266
Amber's going to be
so disappointed.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.801
( sighs )

02:17.972 --> 02:19.905
She does this to me
all the time.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.607
Mom's just trying
to protect us.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.175
I don't need
protecting,

02:23.177 --> 02:25.110
and I'm tired of
being told what to do.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.645
She treats us
like children.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.480
Well, we are children.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.849
We're old enough to do
things without constant
mothering,

02:30.851 --> 02:33.785
especially from someone
who isn't even my real mother.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.854
But she is
your real mother,

02:35.856 --> 02:37.756
just like Dad
is my dad.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.024
- ( knocking on door )
- Amber.

02:39.026 --> 02:42.694
Oh! Girls,
I've been thinking.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.796
I was worried about
letting you go alone,

02:44.798 --> 02:48.100
but what if
I go with you?

02:48.102 --> 02:49.835
We could have
a nice day on the water.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.604
Then we could watch the meteor
shower when it gets dark.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.806
Great idea, Mom.
Right, Amber?

02:54.808 --> 02:57.075
All right,
if that's what it takes.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.580
( bell rings twice )

03:06.287 --> 03:08.787
There it is,
the Cloudless Sea.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.390
Oh, meteor shower,
here we come!

03:11.392 --> 03:12.457
( gasps )

03:14.228 --> 03:16.328
Sorry, girls,
change of plans. Hold on.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.796
Coming about.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.902
Wait. Where are
we going?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.571
That looks like
a ship in trouble.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.207
I see the ship,

03:28.209 --> 03:30.742
but I'm really not
seeing the trouble part.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.244
I think they're
stuck on a reef.

03:32.246 --> 03:35.247
Girls, what's the number one
rule of the sea?

03:35.249 --> 03:36.715
Always help
a ship in need.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.250
Very good, Sofia.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.552
But we don't know
they're in trouble.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.054
They're not sending
out a signal.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.189
It never hurts
to check.

03:44.191 --> 03:45.724
Sometimes people are
afraid to ask for help.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.493
Or maybe they don't
need help.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.362
MAN: Help! Ahoy there!

03:50.364 --> 03:51.763
Help!!

03:51.765 --> 03:53.565
Here, put your
life vests on.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.968
( bell rings twice )

03:57.938 --> 04:00.339
Ahoy there.
Are you in trouble?

04:00.341 --> 04:02.507
Can't you see?
We be stranded on a reef.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.009
Can we give you a tow?

04:04.011 --> 04:06.545
What? I already have
ten toes.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.779
I don't need any more.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.616
Mr. Captain, what
my mother meant was,

04:10.618 --> 04:13.051
can we pull
your ship free?

04:13.053 --> 04:15.787
Finally, a helpful idea.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.789
Sofia, take the wheel.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.425
I'll throw you a line.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.127
Mother, are you
sure about this?

04:22.129 --> 04:24.363
Amber, it's our duty
to help.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.598
We'll just pull them free
and be on our way.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.000
Catch.

04:29.303 --> 04:30.936
Now take the line,

04:30.938 --> 04:33.405
and attach it to
the cleat on the bow.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.906
The what on the where?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.308
What's she talking about?

04:36.310 --> 04:38.810
The cleat.
Up front... the bow.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.747
You heard the lady.
Tie it up there.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.715
Aye, aye, captain.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.828
Good. Now, as soon
as you're free,

04:56.830 --> 04:58.797
cast off the line.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.513
MAN: There she goes!
There she goes!

05:17.284 --> 05:19.685
Yes, you've got it.
Now cast the line.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.453
Crash the swine.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.854
Trash the grime.

05:22.856 --> 05:23.989
Blast the mine.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.525
Mom, I don't think
they've got it.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.261
Captain,
drive to port.
Drive to port.

05:29.263 --> 05:30.929
Stop talkin' gibberish.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.297
I can't understand ya.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.832
Turn left.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.876
Now look what ya done.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.311
You've wrecked our ship.

05:46.313 --> 05:49.381
Your ship is fine.
We are sinking.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.184
Well, you shoulda watched
where you were goin'.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.853
Girls, up here.
Be careful.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.888
Ya best come aboard,
me hearties.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.657
Mom, what should we do?

05:58.659 --> 06:00.325
We have no choice.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.361
We have to abandon ship.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.963
AMBER:
Unbelievable!

06:04.965 --> 06:07.065
This day
is totally ruined.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.700
Now our boat is sunk,
and I'll never get to see

06:08.702 --> 06:09.901
the meteor shower.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.070
All because we had to
stop and help

06:12.072 --> 06:13.739
a bunch of clumsy...

06:13.741 --> 06:17.242
Yes, indeed.
Pi-ra-tes.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.378
I think he means
pirates.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.480
Sofia, Amber,
get behind me.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.716
- Listen, Captain...
- Quivers.

06:24.718 --> 06:28.153
Captain Quivers,
we don't want to be in the way,

06:28.155 --> 06:31.890
so if you could just
sail us back to Enchancia.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.825
That won't be possible.

06:33.827 --> 06:37.062
But, Mr. Captain Quivers,
we rescued you.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.732
Nay. 'Twas we
rescued you.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.901
You're part of
me crew now,

06:42.903 --> 06:45.370
and pirate rule
number one says,

06:45.372 --> 06:46.905
nobody gets off
the ship

06:46.907 --> 06:49.741
till we find
the treasure
we seek.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.443
Uh-huh. And how long
will that take?

06:51.445 --> 06:54.913
Hard to say. We've only
been lookin' for 15 years.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.515
ALL: Fifteen years?!

06:56.517 --> 06:58.183
Off we go, boyos.

06:59.119 --> 07:02.087
Now soist the hails.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.957
Welcome aboard
the<i> Miss Fortune,</i> ladies.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.193
You be one of us now.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.362
( squawking )
<i> Miss Fortune.</i>

07:10.364 --> 07:12.397
<i> Miss Fortune.</i>
Ha ha.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.632
Don't worry, girls.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.967
I will find a way
to get us home.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.303
QUIVERS:
Anchors at bay!

07:22.609 --> 07:25.143
They don't seem
very good at this.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.317
Ready the net, boyos.

07:32.319 --> 07:35.120
Here she comes.

07:36.824 --> 07:40.425
( laughs )
That can't be good.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.961
They are the worst
sailors I've ever seen.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.231
Maybe that's how
we're going to get home.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.234
These pirates may not
know how to sail,
but we do.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.336
We'll get them
to their treasure,

07:51.338 --> 07:53.004
and then,
they'll take us home.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.440
That could take forever.
There's got to be
a better way.

07:55.442 --> 07:58.109
Come on, Amber.
Mom knows what she's doing.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.145
It was Mom who made us stop
and tow this ship

08:00.147 --> 08:02.147
off that reef.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.916
Amber, she was just trying
to help some sailors.

08:04.918 --> 08:08.119
These aren't sailors,
Sofia, they're pirates.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.155
Captain Quivers,

08:10.157 --> 08:11.823
tell me about
the treasure we're hunting.

08:11.825 --> 08:16.161
We seek the Golden Maiden
of the 17 Seas.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.196
And I think we can
help you find it.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.465
Well, we don't be
needing your help.

08:20.467 --> 08:23.134
MAN: Look out!

08:23.136 --> 08:25.203
Man in a barrel!

08:25.205 --> 08:27.005
I'll make you a deal.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.508
We help you find the treasure,
you take us home.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.176
My mom is
an excellent sailor.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.911
Are you sayin'
I am not?

08:35.449 --> 08:37.949
That's what
she's sayin'.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.318
( yells )

08:40.320 --> 08:43.154
Very well then.
It's a deal.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.656
Now cut me down,
ya scallywags!

08:44.658 --> 08:46.391
BOTH: Aye, aye, captain.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.231
Lower the mizzen
and hoist the main.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.200
Wait a minute.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.203
I be the captain,
and I be givin'
the orders 'round here.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.804
Be my guest.

08:59.806 --> 09:03.041
Uh, do exactly
what she said.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.143
So, Mr. Captain
Quivers,

09:05.145 --> 09:07.679
who is
this golden maiden?

09:07.681 --> 09:08.914
She be not a who.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.882
She be a what.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.818
She be an enchanted
figurehead.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.353
For the front
of the ship?

09:15.355 --> 09:19.190
Aye. Just say
your destination
in the maiden's ear,

09:19.192 --> 09:23.495
and she'll magically
guide your ship there.

09:23.497 --> 09:26.765
So, captain, how do you
hope to find the maiden?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.500
There be an ancient shanty

09:28.502 --> 09:31.670
that tells where to find
the Golden Maiden.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.105
It were passed down
through the generations

09:34.107 --> 09:37.008
from me
great-great-grandcap'n.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.743
So where's
the treasure then?

09:38.745 --> 09:40.445
That I cannot tell ya.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.715
But I can sing it.

09:43.717 --> 09:47.085
¶ There are many things
we don't do well ¶

09:47.087 --> 09:50.288
¶ Can't swab the deck
or ring a bell ¶

09:50.290 --> 09:53.458
¶ Or navigate
by stars at night ¶

09:53.460 --> 09:55.694
¶ And Wrongway
can't tell left from right ¶

09:55.696 --> 09:57.429
'Tis true.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.632
¶ But all our troubles
would be past ¶

10:00.634 --> 10:03.902
¶ If we could find
one golden lass ¶

10:03.904 --> 10:07.639
¶ To guide us
on our pirate quest ¶

10:07.641 --> 10:12.777
¶ And lead us
home at last ¶

10:13.714 --> 10:15.447
¶ We seek a lovely maid ¶

10:15.449 --> 10:17.282
¶ Golden locks
and eyes of jade ¶

10:17.284 --> 10:20.752
¶ Many years we've been
searching in vain ¶

10:20.754 --> 10:23.121
¶ Still we sail
across the waves ¶

10:23.123 --> 10:24.956
¶ For a treasure
that we crave ¶

10:24.958 --> 10:27.292
¶ When we find her,
we'll be never lost again ¶

10:27.294 --> 10:33.064
¶ When we find her,
we'll be never lost again ¶

10:35.068 --> 10:36.735
¶ Listen well
and I'll sing to you ¶

10:36.737 --> 10:39.170
¶ The very firstest
treasure clue ¶

10:39.172 --> 10:42.474
¶ Pass the snores
of Old Argyle ¶

10:42.476 --> 10:45.944
¶ Then steady on
and in a little while ¶

10:45.946 --> 10:48.313
¶ A bigger challenge
ye shall face ¶

10:48.315 --> 10:50.281
¶ The kind that sets
your heart to race ¶

10:50.283 --> 10:54.285
¶ Stick your courage
to the boards ¶

10:54.287 --> 10:57.856
¶ And sail through
the Sea of Lemming Hordes ¶

10:57.858 --> 10:59.958
¶ We seek a lovely maid ¶

10:59.960 --> 11:02.127
¶ Golden locks
and eyes of jade ¶

11:02.129 --> 11:05.330
¶ Many years we've been
searching in vain ¶

11:05.332 --> 11:07.766
¶ Still we sail
across the waves ¶

11:07.768 --> 11:09.801
¶ For a treasure
that we crave ¶

11:09.803 --> 11:13.605
¶ When we find her,
we'll be never lost again ¶

11:13.607 --> 11:18.276
¶ When we find her,
we'll be never lost again ¶

11:19.713 --> 11:21.312
¶ The next clue
is the hardest yet ¶

11:21.314 --> 11:23.314
¶ That leads you
to a fearsome threat ¶

11:23.316 --> 11:26.384
¶ Aim yer prow,
ye filthy rubes ¶

11:26.386 --> 11:30.522
¶ Right through the Stream
of Coating Floobs ¶

11:30.524 --> 11:33.224
¶ And closer now
yer treasure be ¶

11:33.226 --> 11:35.226
¶ Where the full
moon rises undersea ¶

11:35.228 --> 11:38.563
¶ In the weaving
part of the loom ¶

11:38.565 --> 11:42.300
¶ Yer treasure lies
within a watery tomb ¶

11:42.302 --> 11:44.369
¶ We seek a lovely maid ¶

11:44.371 --> 11:46.404
¶ Golden locks
and eyes of jade ¶

11:46.406 --> 11:50.141
¶ Many years we've been
searching in vain ¶

11:50.143 --> 11:52.143
¶ Still we sail
across the waves ¶

11:52.145 --> 11:54.379
¶ For a treasure
that we crave ¶

11:54.381 --> 11:58.183
¶ When we find her
we'll be never lost again ¶

11:58.185 --> 11:59.584
¶ When we find her
we'll be never lost again ¶

11:59.586 --> 12:01.152
¶ Tough tides will turn ¶

12:01.154 --> 12:03.354
¶ Other pirates
and ships be tossed ¶

12:03.356 --> 12:10.061
¶ We'll find her
and be never lost again ¶

12:10.063 --> 12:12.230
¶ Never lost again! ¶

12:12.232 --> 12:13.998
( pirates laughing )

12:14.000 --> 12:16.267
The words to the song
don't make any sense.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.436
Coating floobs?

12:18.438 --> 12:20.205
The weaving part
of the loom?

12:20.207 --> 12:22.440
I've never heard of
any of these places.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.109
Me neither.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.010
This is hopeless.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.078
We're never going
to get home.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.580
We have to find
another way.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.015
Let's just work on
figuring out the song's lyrics.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.852
They must be clues
to where the treasure's hidden.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.386
What about that boat?

12:35.388 --> 12:37.255
We could sneak off
when they're not looking.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.257
A rowboat?
I don't know, Amber.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.426
That doesn't look
too sturdy.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.627
Let's just stick
to the plan.

12:42.629 --> 12:45.230
The plan is going
to take forever.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.632
The meteor shower
will be over by then.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.467
Unless...

12:49.469 --> 12:53.104
There is something familiar
about the Snores of Argyle.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.207
- Really?
- You know how Captain Quivers
always mixes up his words?

12:56.209 --> 12:58.643
The Snores of Argyle
sounds just like

12:58.645 --> 13:00.445
the shores of
Shark Isle.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.280
I think he
mixed up the words.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.917
- There's Shark Isle
right now.
- What? Where?

13:05.919 --> 13:08.386
Well, blow me down
like a feather.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.957
There's my escape.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.663
Don't you think
we should get closer,

13:18.665 --> 13:21.166
and sail past the shore,
like the song says?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.334
Ya heard the lady.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.670
Turn this ship, um...

13:25.672 --> 13:27.172
Hard to port!

13:27.174 --> 13:29.340
ALL: Aye, aye...

13:30.310 --> 13:33.144
Port is left.
Starboard is right.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.746
Ho ho, right!

13:34.748 --> 13:36.147
No, left!

13:36.149 --> 13:39.751
Taught 'em everything
they know.

13:39.753 --> 13:43.354
( squawks )
That explains a lot.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.089
Let's work on
the next clue.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.425
Sing it for 'em
again, boyos.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.296
Oh, come on.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.764
¶ The wee lass
is gettin' away ¶

13:52.766 --> 13:54.465
¶ The wee lass
is gettin' away ¶

13:54.467 --> 13:55.934
Those be not the words.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.770
¶ Those be not the words ¶

13:58.772 --> 14:01.506
No, the wee lass
is gettin' away!

14:01.508 --> 14:04.142
Ah, the wee lass
<i> is</i> gettin' away.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.978
Bring her in,
boyos.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.714
There she goes!

14:12.853 --> 14:14.786
- Oh!
- Uh-oh.

14:14.788 --> 14:18.423
- Oh! Oh, no, no, no.
- Amber!

14:29.569 --> 14:32.403
Swab the deck,
ya lassies,

14:32.405 --> 14:34.038
or it's the brig
for ya.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.175
Amber, why didn't you
go with the plan like I asked?

14:37.177 --> 14:39.344
We were just starting
to gain the pirates' trust.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.713
Now I have to go
smooth things over.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.514
Captain,
you have to admit,

14:43.516 --> 14:45.583
we found the first clue
to the treasure.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.818
The shores of Shark Isle.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.821
And yer wee lass
tried to trick us.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.222
( thumping sounds )

14:51.224 --> 14:52.557
What was that?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.759
Amber, you have to
listen to Mom.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.195
Mom got us into
this trouble in
the first place.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.564
She's just trying
to take care of us.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.099
I can take care
of myself.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.734
Look out!

15:02.736 --> 15:04.602
Fly fish!

15:04.604 --> 15:06.271
Sofia, you were right.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.872
He's got the words
all wrong.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.408
It's not the Sea of
Lemming Hordes.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.578
It's the Sea of
Swimming Swords.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.916
QUIVERS:
Man your stations!

15:21.922 --> 15:23.454
Hit the deck!

15:23.456 --> 15:25.256
They be rippin'
the sails.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.725
I'll protect the sails.
Sofia, steer us out of here.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.761
Got it, Mom.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.334
- Amber, fend them off.
- Me?

15:38.905 --> 15:40.605
You're messing with
the wrong princess.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.440
( all yelling )

15:46.046 --> 15:48.613
Hold that line.
Heave the sail tight.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.881
Aye, aye, Captain Lady.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.420
Oh, they're gone.
I think we made it.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.222
We just completed
the first verse of
the treasure song.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.425
Sail past the
shores of Shark Isle,

16:00.427 --> 16:02.460
and through the Sea
of Swimming Swords.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.562
Wasn't that exciting,
you guys?

16:04.564 --> 16:06.831
About as exciting as
a cast asea walker.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.967
I think I've got
the next verse, too.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.568
The one about
coating floobs?

16:10.570 --> 16:14.339
Coating floobs
is really floating cubes.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.573
Icebergs.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.576
( gasps )
Of course. The Icy Sea.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.979
Steer north
by northwest.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.481
Aye, aye, Captain Mom.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.949
But what about
the meteor shower?

16:24.951 --> 16:26.484
Amber, you and I will go up
to the crow's nest

16:26.486 --> 16:28.286
to watch for icebergs.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.155
Sofia, stay on the wheel,
and follow our directions.

16:31.157 --> 16:34.592
Ahem. This still
be my ship,

16:34.594 --> 16:36.527
and I still
be givin' the orders.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.597
My apologies,
Captain Quivers.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.500
Would you rather navigate
the Icy Sea yourself?

16:42.502 --> 16:45.103
Uh-oh. Icy Sea.
Certain doom.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.537
( squawks )

16:46.539 --> 16:49.040
Um, please,
be my guest.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.109
And that's
an order.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.848
Keep a sharp eye out
for icebergs.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.617
If we hit one,
it could be bad.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.552
We wouldn't have to
go through any icebergs

17:01.554 --> 17:03.121
if you just listened to me.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.556
We could have escaped
in that rowboat.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.991
Amber, it wasn't safe.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.659
And we wouldn't be
stuck on this ship

17:08.661 --> 17:11.129
if you hadn't made us
stop and help these pirates.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.331
Okay, that might not
have been the best decision,

17:13.333 --> 17:15.633
but I'm doing
the best I can.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.236
Why didn't you just
let us go alone
in the first place?

17:18.238 --> 17:20.571
I was just thinking
of your safety, Amber.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.673
That's what moms do.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.576
Icebergs!
Dead ahead off the bow!

17:25.578 --> 17:26.778
Head to port.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.252
- Not good.
- You can say that again.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.486
Starboard!

17:40.860 --> 17:42.393
Port!

17:42.395 --> 17:44.729
QUIVERS:
Icebergs dead ahead.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.564
Starboard!

17:49.235 --> 17:50.835
Amber!

17:50.837 --> 17:53.604
Fancy girl overboard!

17:53.606 --> 17:55.740
Wait. Come back.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.608
Come back!

17:57.610 --> 18:00.411
- Amber.
- Mom?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.113
Mom!

18:03.783 --> 18:05.850
Here. Take my hand.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.721
I'm sorry, Mom.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.356
I didn't mean
to act that way.

18:12.358 --> 18:15.927
Sometimes I can
be so...

18:15.929 --> 18:17.462
selfish.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.863
I'm sorry.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.698
Oh, I know.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.300
And I'm glad you told me
how you really feel.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.303
You girls are growing
up so fast.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.438
I guess I need to learn
how to let you.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.807
Sorry I got us
stuck on an iceberg.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.542
Don't you worry.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.478
Sofia will turn
that ship around,

18:33.480 --> 18:35.913
and be back for us
in no time.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.882
Go back into
the icebergs?

18:37.884 --> 18:39.650
Not a chance!

18:39.652 --> 18:41.052
But my mom
and Amber
are stuck there.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.820
We have to
go get them.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.123
No more icebergs!

18:45.125 --> 18:47.291
Set sail for...

18:47.293 --> 18:48.826
What is the next clue,
little lady?

18:48.828 --> 18:50.928
Hmm.

18:50.930 --> 18:54.665
The next clue is to head for
the weaving part of the loom.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.101
You must know
where that is, right?

18:57.103 --> 19:00.905
Hm. Nobody said anything
about a pop quiz.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.441
I'm pretty sure
it's a constellation.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.577
But nobody knows the stars
better than my sister Amber.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.279
So if you want to figure out
the next clue,

19:08.281 --> 19:10.915
you have to help me
rescue her and my mom.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.784
They'll take us straight to
the Golden Maiden.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.486
Just saying.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.522
Oh, all right.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.157
Have it your way.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.791
And that's an order.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.828
- Bring her about.
- Aye, aye, princess.

19:25.932 --> 19:29.500
Mom, do parrots
live on icebergs?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.702
No. Wait, what?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.538
( squawking )

19:38.344 --> 19:40.945
( whistles )
Ahoy there.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.780
Prepare to be rescued.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.851
All right, let's find
the Golden Maiden.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.052
Sing it again, boys.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.787
( blows pitch pipe )

19:49.789 --> 19:51.789
¶ And closer now
your treasure be ¶

19:51.791 --> 19:53.691
¶ Where the full moon
rises undersea ¶

19:53.693 --> 19:57.061
¶ In the weaving part
of the loom ¶

19:57.063 --> 19:58.696
The weaving part
of the loom.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.798
Could that be
a constellation?

20:00.800 --> 20:04.035
No. There is no such thing
as the weaving part of the loom.

20:04.037 --> 20:07.705
Oh, but there is
an evening star of Khaldoun.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.540
Right there.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.875
Well done, Amber.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.577
We'll steer for
the Star of Khaldoun.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.582
The song says to go
through the whirly burly.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.150
What could that be?

20:19.152 --> 20:21.052
It's an actual
part of the ocean.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.354
It's called
the whirly burly.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.923
You got that part of the song
right, Captain Quivers.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.525
You hear that, mateys?

20:27.527 --> 20:29.260
We got it right.

20:29.262 --> 20:32.029
First time for
everything.
( squawks )

20:32.031 --> 20:34.565
But you may wish
you had been wrong.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.668
We're going to sail
right between the whirlpools,

20:37.670 --> 20:39.837
and the spinning currents
will shoot us out
the other side.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.138
We're gonna what now?

20:46.879 --> 20:48.679
Are you sure about this?

20:48.681 --> 20:51.782
Amber, are you sure that's
the evening star of Khaldoun?

20:51.784 --> 20:53.951
- Definitely.
- Then I'm sure, too.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.753
Steady as she goes!

20:58.124 --> 20:59.924
Tell me when
it's over.

21:23.249 --> 21:26.984
Oh, look. It's like the moon
is underwater.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.654
When the full moon
rises under the sea...

21:29.656 --> 21:32.990
The Golden Maiden
of the 17 Seas!

21:32.992 --> 21:37.061
At long last,
she be ours!

21:41.901 --> 21:43.968
QUIVERS: We'll never
be lost again.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.603
So do we still
have a deal?

21:45.605 --> 21:48.439
Indeed we do.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.509
Take us to Enhancia.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.511
Enchancia.

21:53.513 --> 21:56.213
Enchancia.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.850
Comin' about!

22:06.292 --> 22:10.027
Well, girls, that
was quite a day.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.962
I'm really glad
you came along, Mom.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.831
So am I.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.166
Amber, look.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.870
The Minotaur
meteor shower!

22:19.872 --> 22:22.473
Oh, I forgot
all about it.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.275
Wow, look at them all.

22:24.277 --> 22:26.177
Thanks, Mom.

22:26.179 --> 22:29.046
I didn't think this day
could get any better.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.781
I couldn't
agree more.
