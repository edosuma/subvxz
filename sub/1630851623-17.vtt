WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.829
I can't believe
this is happening.

00:05.309 --> 00:07.007
How are you here?

00:07.050 --> 00:09.661
Oh, I got in a little bit
of a fight,

00:09.705 --> 00:12.142
but don't worry, I'll heal.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.014
Hope, you're the Tribrid.
I didn't think anything

00:14.057 --> 00:16.625
could hurt you bad enough
to send you to Limbo,

00:16.668 --> 00:18.714
much less...I'm not dead, okay? I promise.

00:18.757 --> 00:22.370
I just... got my ass kicked
by a god to save our friends.

00:23.588 --> 00:25.503
Wh-Wh-Whoa, there are gods now?

00:25.547 --> 00:27.984
You missed a lot.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.682
I missed you.
We can talk about it after.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.162
After what?

00:44.740 --> 00:46.698
[boat bangs
against dock]

00:52.487 --> 00:54.097
This is why we can't
have nice things.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.317
Yeah, well, in his defense,
he just got back from ferrying

00:56.360 --> 00:58.101
my mom to Peace,
so it would've been nice

00:58.145 --> 00:59.363
if you'd takenthe time

00:59.407 --> 01:00.756
to show her around
a little.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.541
Then you have some
explaining to do.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.806
I don't think we'll have time.
The Ferryman controls Limbo,

01:07.850 --> 01:10.200
who belongs here and
who doesn't and for how long.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.723
And since you're immortal,

01:11.767 --> 01:13.943
I don't think
he's gonna let you stay.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.379
We met when I was in transition

01:15.423 --> 01:17.555
into the Tribrid.
He didn't mind me

01:17.599 --> 01:19.992
sticking around then.A lot's changed since then.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.298
Becoming the Tribrid
was your choice,

01:21.342 --> 01:23.605
and unfortunately for us,

01:23.648 --> 01:25.433
I don't think this is.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.096
â™ª

01:37.749 --> 01:39.751
[knocking]

01:41.449 --> 01:43.842
E, what are you doing?

01:43.886 --> 01:46.497
What does it look like
I'm doing?

01:46.541 --> 01:48.108
I'm getting ready to train.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.848
Not after what happened
last night.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.894
I'm feeling a lot better.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.417
You can't be using your powers
until we figure out

01:53.461 --> 01:55.027
what's wrong with you.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.986
MG, I think you're overreacting
a little bit.

02:03.210 --> 02:06.822
You just phased out of your
sneakers. [chuckles]
Okay.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.694
Maybe I'm
under-reacting.

02:09.738 --> 02:10.739
[sighs]

02:12.219 --> 02:15.222
The last time I got benched
because of an injury,

02:15.265 --> 02:17.311
I lost my entire future,

02:17.354 --> 02:19.487
not to mention
all of

02:19.530 --> 02:21.445
my friends.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.230
E, that was football.

02:23.273 --> 02:26.233
The game that we're playing
has much higher stakes,

02:26.276 --> 02:28.017
and I need youfor it

02:28.060 --> 02:29.540
at 100%, okay?

02:29.584 --> 02:32.630
LIZZIE: Then what's our plan
to get him there? Sorry,

02:32.674 --> 02:34.110
but also not sorry

02:34.154 --> 02:36.330
because vamp hearing
is kind of awesome.

02:36.373 --> 02:39.202
MG: Lizzie, I got this,
and you both

02:39.246 --> 02:40.943
should be resting.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.945
Even Hope is...LIZZIE: Vamp healing

02:42.988 --> 02:44.599
is even more awesome,
so while I'm glad

02:44.642 --> 02:46.122
Hope is getting
her beauty sleep,

02:46.166 --> 02:47.689
I am back in the game.

02:50.257 --> 02:53.477
And that game is apologizing

02:53.521 --> 02:55.697
for all of
the stupid things I did,

02:55.740 --> 02:58.265
including going after
a god without you.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.832
You must be pretty mad
at me, huh?

03:00.876 --> 03:02.965
Not at all.

03:03.008 --> 03:05.489
I don't buy it,
but it doesn't matter

03:05.533 --> 03:06.925
because my dad told me

03:06.969 --> 03:08.884
that the best way to make amends

03:08.927 --> 03:11.103
is to listen
to what people need,

03:11.147 --> 03:13.889
and here you are,
clearly in need of help

03:13.932 --> 03:15.064
fixing Ethan's powers.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.244
[chuckles]

03:21.288 --> 03:22.550
[chuckles]

03:24.552 --> 03:27.381
Look, I-I appreciate the offer,

03:27.424 --> 03:29.252
okay, but I'm gonna go
hit the books alone.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.080
Don't bother,

03:31.123 --> 03:32.908
because you know what all
those books are gonna tell you?

03:32.951 --> 03:34.257
Is that you need magic.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.606
And did I mention,

03:35.650 --> 03:37.521
as a Heretic,
I can do that, too?

03:38.914 --> 03:40.742
Do you actually think
that you can fix

03:40.785 --> 03:42.047
whatever's wrong
with me?

03:42.091 --> 03:43.571
I do.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.618
What say you, MG?

03:52.797 --> 03:54.277
BEN:
Thank you for coming.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.887
ALARIC: Well,
don't thank me yet.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.454
I'm probably not gonna
believe a word you say,

03:57.498 --> 03:59.456
not after you raised a god
you claimed to hate

03:59.500 --> 04:00.718
and then betrayed us.

04:00.762 --> 04:03.243
I do hate my father.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.679
I was a fool to think
I could save

04:04.722 --> 04:06.289
the school from his wrath,

04:06.333 --> 04:09.727
or free Jed from a curse
that he no longer views as such.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.207
Then why'd you do it?

04:12.861 --> 04:15.124
Love, I think.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.908
[sighs]

04:16.952 --> 04:18.606
Well...

04:18.649 --> 04:21.739
then that's the first thing
about you I understand.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.960
What do you want to talk about?

04:25.003 --> 04:26.744
A way to atone
for my mistakes.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.529
If...

04:28.572 --> 04:30.661
you even think that's possible.

04:30.705 --> 04:32.707
Given the conversations
I've been having

04:32.750 --> 04:34.361
with my daughter lately,

04:34.404 --> 04:37.189
I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.279
In that case, I'd like
to help you kill my father.

04:39.322 --> 04:42.107
Well, I'd like that, too.

04:42.151 --> 04:43.848
I assumed he
couldn't die, though,

04:43.892 --> 04:45.154
like you.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.243
That's not exactly true.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.594
Only a god can kill another god.

04:50.638 --> 04:53.945
Well, that sounds
awfully convenient.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.295
Perhaps a lie

04:55.338 --> 04:57.558
just to get you out
of this cell.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.386
Headmaster Saltzman,

04:59.429 --> 05:01.431
I had to find a reason
to trust you,

05:01.475 --> 05:04.782
as you must now find one
to trust me.

05:04.826 --> 05:08.308
But I wouldn't know
what that would be.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.701
Desperation.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.749
Think that should be
reason enough for both of us.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.056
And here I thought
I was hiding it so well.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.408
If you have a better plan,
pursue it,

05:21.451 --> 05:22.844
but my father is

05:22.887 --> 05:24.846
as predictable
as he is cruel.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.805
He will be back to get
what I suspect he wants.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.939
And what does he want this time?

05:33.985 --> 05:36.031
[rattling, thudding]

05:42.820 --> 05:44.213
[noise stops]

05:55.572 --> 05:57.400
[chuckles]

05:57.444 --> 05:59.707
[laughing]

05:59.750 --> 06:02.187
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:02.231 --> 06:03.711
You look ridiculous.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.669
So, you're

06:05.713 --> 06:07.062
the king of the gods,

06:07.105 --> 06:09.412
whose name escapes me
at the moment.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.632
Your simple tongue
may call me Ken.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.547
[chortles] Oh, dear.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.418
That's even sillier.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.159
My name...
Is Aurora

06:17.202 --> 06:19.030
de Martel.

06:19.074 --> 06:20.380
My bastard son,

06:20.423 --> 06:22.556
Ben, told me
quite a bit about you,

06:22.599 --> 06:25.210
including that we share
one thing in common.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.995
A flair for the dramatic?

06:27.038 --> 06:28.388
A desire to kill the Tribrid.

06:28.431 --> 06:31.347
Allow me
to simplify

06:31.391 --> 06:32.957
my request for
your much smaller brain.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.959
I understand
what you're asking,

06:35.003 --> 06:36.570
and yet I hesitate

06:36.613 --> 06:38.572
for a number of reasons,
including the fact

06:38.615 --> 06:40.791
that you are not
the first charismatic,

06:40.835 --> 06:44.099
power-hungry madman that
I've encountered in my life.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.497
You have never met
the likes of me,

06:50.540 --> 06:51.889
I assure you.

06:51.933 --> 06:54.065
So you don't intend
to manipulate

06:54.109 --> 06:56.111
or torture information
out of me, then?

07:00.332 --> 07:01.464
Actually,

07:01.508 --> 07:03.771
I was hoping
we could share a meal.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.428
Well, I am famished,
but I doubt

07:08.471 --> 07:11.213
anything on the menu
you have planned,

07:11.256 --> 07:12.432
or anything we'd discuss,

07:12.475 --> 07:14.608
would satisfy me.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.697
[gasps]
[grunting]

07:19.613 --> 07:22.746
Well, aren't you
full of surprises.

07:22.790 --> 07:25.009
Oh, you have no idea.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.501
You know me better than anyone,

07:38.545 --> 07:40.198
so you know that
I'm not gonna get wet

07:40.242 --> 07:41.417
just because
Jolly Roger

07:41.461 --> 07:43.288
asks me to go
for a swim.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.595
Uh, actually, I'm-I'm reasonably
certain he intends to stab you.

07:45.639 --> 07:46.857
HOPE:
Well, then let him try.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.859
I'll break every bone
in his body.

07:48.903 --> 07:49.947
[exhales]

07:51.558 --> 07:53.603
There's no beating The Ferryman,
Hope. Trust me, I've tried.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.039
I'm sorry,
are you on his side?

07:55.083 --> 07:56.258
I'm on your side,

07:56.301 --> 07:58.826
always, but using your fists

07:58.869 --> 08:00.262
to solve problems
is what got you

08:00.305 --> 08:01.524
into this mess
in the first place.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.352
Because knowing you
better than anybody,

08:03.395 --> 08:05.876
I'm willing to bet
you fought that god alone.

08:05.920 --> 08:09.010
Well, Lizzie helped.Yeah, but-- Sorry, just...

08:09.053 --> 08:11.447
People come to Limbo
to learn a lesson,

08:11.491 --> 08:13.449
not to repeat the same mistakes.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.756
So, if what I'm planning is
a mistake, then it won't work,

08:15.799 --> 08:17.453
right?
Uh,

08:17.497 --> 08:18.672
depends on wh-wh-what
you're planning.

08:27.028 --> 08:30.205
My plan is
to change the rules of Limbo.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.207
You with me or not?

08:32.250 --> 08:36.037
I mean, you just
reaped the Reaper, so...

08:36.080 --> 08:39.170
What'd you have in mind?To go home,

08:39.214 --> 08:41.608
but not before I figure out
a way to bring you with me.

08:41.651 --> 08:44.001
That way, I won't
have to fight alone.

08:44.045 --> 08:45.916
One condition.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.059
Let's go home.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.200
So, I don't know where
that scythe sent him,

09:09.244 --> 09:11.551
but The Ferryman is Death,
so we probably don't have long

09:11.594 --> 09:14.597
before he returns.
What's the plan, exactly?

09:14.641 --> 09:17.992
So, Limbo seems to mirror
our world, which should mean...

09:18.035 --> 09:21.082
that the weapons I stole
from the school are here.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.824
Uh, why do we need more weapons?

09:23.867 --> 09:26.740
Because scythes
are surprisingly unwieldy.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.524
If that's what The Ferryman uses
to send our souls

09:28.568 --> 09:30.004
wherever he wants,
then I'd rather he not

09:30.047 --> 09:31.527
have the option
and have one

09:31.571 --> 09:33.181
that I'm a little bit
more familiar with.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.052
Hm.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.750
Especially if what
you said was true.

09:39.970 --> 09:42.233
What? There's an axe
in there for you.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.758
Why did you steal weapons from
the school in the first place?

09:46.455 --> 09:48.326
I went after Ken

09:48.370 --> 09:50.459
without the Squad because
I didn't want to put their lives

09:50.502 --> 09:52.592
at risk after everything
I'd already put them through.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.117
And once

09:56.160 --> 09:58.685
I became the Tribrid,
killed you,

09:58.728 --> 10:00.208
my humanity shut off.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.862
I know.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.647
Dr. Saltzman told me
after you put him into a coma.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.781
I'm glad I missed that chapter.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.391
Me, too.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.480
I thought you
would've been mad,

10:11.523 --> 10:12.873
after everything
you had to give up.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.353
Ah, I'm always
on your side, remember?

10:18.226 --> 10:20.315
I'd do it all again.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.796
I know you better
than anyone, so...

10:22.839 --> 10:24.580
I'm assuming that means

10:24.624 --> 10:26.713
you bought Dr. Saltzman
back to life.

10:28.323 --> 10:31.631
Uh, it was more
of a team effort.

10:35.765 --> 10:38.246
That was quite refreshing.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.640
And this is positively

10:40.683 --> 10:43.425
gorgeous.It was less so
when we arrived,

10:43.468 --> 10:45.688
so I made these
flowers bloom,

10:45.732 --> 10:47.385
hoping you
would like them.

10:47.429 --> 10:50.258
You can make such things happen,
and you carried

10:50.301 --> 10:52.042
that giant
tin can here?

10:52.086 --> 10:55.785
I thought it a more fitting
setting for our discussion.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.439
Then the legends
must be true.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.441
You are extremely powerful.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.226
Now...

11:02.270 --> 11:04.489
let's work on that wardrobe,
shall we?

11:08.580 --> 11:11.888
Those garments are impractical
for battle.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.107
Not in the modern world,
darling.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.892
If it pleases you.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.600
So, what would please me
is to know

11:28.644 --> 11:30.646
why you wish to kill
the Tribrid.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.866
I am the most powerful being
in existence,

11:32.909 --> 11:35.651
so imagine my surprise

11:35.695 --> 11:37.348
when I was awoken

11:37.392 --> 11:40.090
and heard there was a girl
claiming that same title.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.570
I must crush her

11:41.613 --> 11:44.616
and prove otherwise.
Such is the way of gods.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.270
And you thought
you could crush her

11:46.314 --> 11:47.794
without my help, did you?

11:47.837 --> 11:50.753
I bested her thoroughly,
but she refuses to die.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.451
That sounds like her, all right.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.847
Is...

11:57.891 --> 12:00.415
something wrong?

12:00.458 --> 12:02.417
[sighs]

12:04.288 --> 12:06.551
I'm not sure yet.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.774
I am unaccustomed
to asking for help,

12:11.818 --> 12:13.254
Aurora de Martel,

12:13.297 --> 12:15.735
but you cannot imagine
what I have gone through,

12:15.778 --> 12:18.215
being imprisoned by
my own family for centuries.

12:18.259 --> 12:21.436
The loneliness of that,
the torture.

12:21.479 --> 12:25.266
The utter lack of love, which is
the very thing that fuels a god.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.528
Then returning

12:26.571 --> 12:28.182
to a world where
my betrayal continues.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.183
A world I do not

12:29.226 --> 12:32.316
understand, but must rule.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.800
I desperately need a guide.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.149
Perhaps...

12:41.499 --> 12:44.067
even someone to rule it with.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.896
[chuckles]

12:48.463 --> 12:50.813
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, shall we?

12:54.338 --> 12:57.472
But I don't have
to imagine such things,

12:57.515 --> 13:00.301
for I have experienced
them all myself.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.825
Does that mean you will help me?

13:02.869 --> 13:04.958
If so, merely name your price.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.266
MG:
He's cute,

13:09.310 --> 13:10.572
but I don't see
how this collar

13:10.615 --> 13:12.095
or this monster's
gonna help us

13:12.139 --> 13:13.793
with our Ethan problem.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.534
Well, the way I see it,
the Pukwudgie--

13:16.578 --> 13:17.840
which we should
probably give a name,

13:17.884 --> 13:19.450
so we don't have
to keep saying that--

13:19.494 --> 13:21.844
has the same powers
as Ethan, right?

13:21.888 --> 13:24.542
So, we can gather data
using this device,

13:24.586 --> 13:26.109
that I've magically enchanted.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.937
Hence why you needed my help.

13:27.981 --> 13:30.026
What kind of data?Every time

13:30.070 --> 13:31.854
the Pukwudgie--
there's that word again--

13:31.898 --> 13:34.988
phases, this collar
will track the distance

13:35.031 --> 13:36.903
and frequency of its jumps.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.948
That way,
we can know how far

13:38.992 --> 13:40.863
and how often
he uses his powers

13:40.907 --> 13:43.170
before he runs out of juice,
like Ethan.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.867
And, therefore,

13:44.911 --> 13:47.130
how long they both need to rest
in order to recover.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.916
Makes sense, but how do we
get him to phase?

13:49.959 --> 13:52.875
That's where you come in.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.486
Chuck this bad boy
as far as you can.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.793
Are you sure? I got a cannon.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.229
Good.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.101
Because the farther
you throw that ball,

14:01.144 --> 14:02.842
the farther this little guy's
gonna have to phase to get it.

14:02.885 --> 14:03.886
[whines]

14:03.930 --> 14:04.974
And then the quicker

14:05.018 --> 14:05.888
this experiment will be done.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.586
Sounds good to me.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.375
Wait, where
are you going?

14:14.418 --> 14:15.767
Won't it just fetch?

14:15.811 --> 14:17.508
It's not a trained dog, MG,

14:17.552 --> 14:18.901
but there's
a bright side,

14:18.945 --> 14:20.816
going after it will give us

14:20.860 --> 14:23.210
plenty of time to get to the
bottom of why you're mad at me.

14:23.253 --> 14:26.822
Lizzie, for the last time,
I am not mad at you.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.606
Tell that to the ball.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.132
Okay, fine, into the woods.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.524
That's the spirit.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.570
And in that same spirit,
I have compiled

14:35.613 --> 14:38.442
a comprehensive list of all the
reasons you might be mad at me,

14:38.486 --> 14:40.749
in ascending order
according to severity.

14:40.792 --> 14:43.143
LANDON:
Would you put that away?

14:43.186 --> 14:45.667
And let me do the talking.
Ted and I have developed

14:45.710 --> 14:47.190
a...

14:47.234 --> 14:48.713
rapport.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.933
Peace Facilitator seems
like a bit of a...

14:50.977 --> 14:52.369
odd career choice,

14:52.413 --> 14:54.328
since he's
The Necromancer again.

14:54.371 --> 14:55.895
Well, it wasn't
his choice.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.374
And if anyone knows what
it's like to come back

14:57.418 --> 14:59.550
from their trip
to the dark side...

15:01.944 --> 15:04.642
Yeah, really seems like
he's turned over a new leaf.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.296
[exhales]

15:06.340 --> 15:09.691
Yeah, on second thought,
maybe you should wait outside.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.301
NECROMANCER:
Hope

15:11.345 --> 15:13.521
Mikaelson!

15:13.564 --> 15:14.826
Or should I say

15:14.870 --> 15:16.567
the Tribrid?

15:16.611 --> 15:18.526
Oh...

15:18.569 --> 15:20.789
this is rich.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.966
What are you doing here?

15:24.010 --> 15:26.316
You wanted to do
the talking, didn't you?

15:26.360 --> 15:29.189
Right. Uh... I guess I should
start at the beginning.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.799
Save your breath.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.322
It doesn't matter why
either of you are here.

15:34.281 --> 15:37.110
Because I'm so glad you are.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.589
Oh, okay. Oh.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.635
I'll be glad
when we're not hugging.

15:40.678 --> 15:43.899
Oh, oh. Oh, it's quite
poetic, isn't it?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.901
Two lovebirds reunited
in death....

15:45.945 --> 15:47.685
Yes, and we'd like
to remain united,

15:47.729 --> 15:49.426
if you don't mind,
which is why we need...

15:49.470 --> 15:51.385
...only to be torn asunder again

15:51.428 --> 15:53.169
by my bloody hand.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.563
Maybe I should've
taken that axe.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.001
[Necromancer laughing]

16:08.358 --> 16:10.360
[laughs]

16:10.404 --> 16:12.449
[grunts]
Would you...

16:12.493 --> 16:14.190
stop that? [winces]

16:14.234 --> 16:15.844
Oh, I'm

16:15.887 --> 16:17.933
just getting
started. Now,

16:17.977 --> 16:19.587
where did you send Landon,
before I stick

16:19.630 --> 16:21.415
this somewhere that you
can't pull it out?

16:21.458 --> 16:23.547
I sent him back.Back where?

16:23.591 --> 16:25.071
Back to your world,

16:25.114 --> 16:26.594
or should I say,

16:26.637 --> 16:28.639
what used to be your world.

16:28.683 --> 16:29.684
[laughing]

16:29.727 --> 16:32.034
Why would you do that?

16:32.078 --> 16:35.516
Because I found
my groove

16:35.559 --> 16:37.822
in Limbo, baby.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.824
Very recently,

16:39.868 --> 16:43.698
I met the most gorgeous creature
I've ever seen.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.091
She was
the only woman capable

16:45.134 --> 16:47.919
of melting my
cold, black heart.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.183
Landon's mother.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.185
Ew.I sympathize.

16:52.228 --> 16:55.797
Speaking from my past encounters
with you and bloody Big Bird,

16:55.840 --> 16:57.277
I know how cloying

16:57.320 --> 16:58.756
true love can be.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.586
It just feels so different
on this side of the fence,

17:02.630 --> 17:03.805
where Seylah and I

17:03.848 --> 17:06.329
can put the romance

17:06.373 --> 17:08.853
in necromancy.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.641
You know she went
to Peace, right?

17:13.684 --> 17:16.122
Sorry, what was that now?

17:16.165 --> 17:18.602
Good, you don't.
Landon helped her cross over,

17:18.646 --> 17:21.040
and you helped him,
which is, I mean,

17:21.083 --> 17:23.303
why we came to see you
in the first place.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.956
[grunts]

17:25.000 --> 17:28.612
Do not toy with
my fledgling emotions.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.919
No. It simply can't be true.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.139
My plan was perfect.

17:33.182 --> 17:36.229
Remove that mopblock from
this plane, so he can't stand

17:36.272 --> 17:38.318
in the way of us
becoming relatives.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.015
My only regret

17:40.059 --> 17:43.105
was sending Landon back to you
'cause, as you said,

17:43.149 --> 17:44.367
ew.

17:44.411 --> 17:45.673
[laughs] But then
you turned up here,

17:45.716 --> 17:47.414
which means you're dead,

17:47.457 --> 17:50.286
and everything's
just clicked into place, so

17:50.330 --> 17:52.636
I wouldn't
look too smug

17:52.680 --> 17:55.509
because you're stuck
here in Limbo,

17:55.552 --> 17:57.598
and he's stuck there.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.991
[laughs]

18:00.035 --> 18:02.255
You should be able to sense
whether or not I'm dead, right?

18:02.298 --> 18:05.475
Being the almighty
Necromancer and all.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.090
[overlapping voices]

18:11.133 --> 18:13.701
[shudders]

18:13.744 --> 18:16.965
Blinded by feelings.

18:17.008 --> 18:20.577
You know, I'm feeling
something, too...

18:20.621 --> 18:22.492
gratitude

18:22.536 --> 18:25.539
because I no longer
need your help.

18:28.063 --> 18:31.371
Seylah!

18:31.414 --> 18:32.850
ALARIC:
I'll be damned.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.591
Thank you for
your expertise, as always,

18:34.635 --> 18:35.940
Professor Vardemus.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.900
Uh, I just have one more
question for you.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.163
What does Ben's plan
mean for himself?

18:41.207 --> 18:42.599
Because he seems
to think

18:42.643 --> 18:43.948
that his father's gonna
come back to the school

18:43.992 --> 18:45.385
and take another shot
at Hope.

18:45.428 --> 18:46.777
If he does,
we need to be ready.

18:48.257 --> 18:51.739
Because she's still recovering
from the first shot.

18:51.782 --> 18:53.567
Not that I'm secretly panicking

18:53.610 --> 18:56.309
about her refusal
to wake up or anything.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.876
Thanks, I think.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.056
[phone sets down
in cradle]

19:09.322 --> 19:10.932
[grunts]

19:26.121 --> 19:28.471
ALARIC:
Maybe I am losing my mind

19:28.515 --> 19:30.995
because I'm beginning
to believe that you

19:31.039 --> 19:32.910
were telling the truth.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.132
What convinced you?A phone call

19:37.176 --> 19:38.351
with Professor Vardemus.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.744
He thinks that
siphoning your magic

19:40.788 --> 19:43.573
and weaponizing it against
your father could work.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.620
Well, then,
what are we waiting for?

19:46.663 --> 19:48.448
Release me from this prison.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.058
He also thinks
it would kill you,

19:50.101 --> 19:52.495
given that that same magic
is what has allowed

19:52.539 --> 19:54.889
you to die and resurrect
in the past.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.630
If we were
to siphon it,

19:56.673 --> 19:58.240
there's a very good chance

19:58.284 --> 20:00.242
that every organ
in your body would fail.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.115
So, what I'm
waiting for

20:04.159 --> 20:07.249
is you to convince me

20:07.293 --> 20:09.251
that you didn't
already know that.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.515
AURORA:
You clearly see my problem.

20:12.559 --> 20:14.909
The Mikaelson family
abused me,

20:14.952 --> 20:16.650
warped my thinking.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.129
I've since
come to wonder

20:18.173 --> 20:19.740
if my beloved Tristan
had done the same.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.525
Am I trapped in an endless cycle
or simply being told

20:22.569 --> 20:24.875
to walk in a circle?
Either way, like you,

20:24.919 --> 20:26.007
I've lost everything.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.704
But unlike you,

20:27.748 --> 20:29.880
I now doubt that revenge
can restore it.

20:29.924 --> 20:33.144
And yet, I still hear the rage
in your voice.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.712
Confess it, Aurora.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.410
Smiting your enemies
will bring your mind

20:37.453 --> 20:39.150
peace and your brother justice,

20:39.194 --> 20:41.892
even if it does not
bring him back.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.461
But you can,
can't you?

20:45.505 --> 20:48.290
Smite them? Happily.No.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.987
Bring Tristan back.

20:53.513 --> 20:56.255
Return my brother to me,

20:56.298 --> 20:58.735
and I will help you
kill the Tribrid.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.433
That is my ask.

21:00.476 --> 21:03.087
A small one for such
a powerful god, I should think.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.268
You would be wrong.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.445
I cannot do that for you.

21:16.884 --> 21:19.800
Then I don't know the point
of this incessant journey

21:19.843 --> 21:22.281
I've been on, but I do know
that I will not help you.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.021
Because the many
partnerships in my life

21:24.065 --> 21:25.501
have only
given me hope,

21:25.545 --> 21:28.417
and then dashed it
before my eyes.

21:28.461 --> 21:31.290
So, if I'm meant to learn some
lesson, perhaps it's this...

21:33.988 --> 21:36.860
I'm doomed to be alone.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.781
LIZZIE:
Was that triggering?

21:44.825 --> 21:46.609
Not at all, like the other
hundred things

21:46.653 --> 21:48.002
you've asked me about.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.047
We're only on item 62.
Speaking of,

21:50.091 --> 21:52.180
I once told you
comic books

21:52.223 --> 21:53.529
were for people
with baby brains.

21:53.573 --> 21:54.922
I warned you

21:54.965 --> 21:56.445
that these are
in ascending order.

21:56.489 --> 21:59.013
It's all good,
but you know what isn't?

21:59.056 --> 22:01.972
I tossed that ball
into a super public space.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.325
Then let's just
cut to the chase.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.631
I tried
to kill Hope.

22:08.675 --> 22:09.763
But you didn't.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.547
Plus, you were grieving.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.723
And then she actually killed me,
and I lied to you about it.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.246
You were
sire-bonded.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.510
Then, making matters worse,

22:17.553 --> 22:19.076
I died with vampire blood

22:19.120 --> 22:20.774
I stole from the school
in my system.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.123
Turned me into a Heretic.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.081
It, uh, happens
to the best of us.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.735
Then what is it?

22:25.779 --> 22:27.346
I know you, Milton Greasley.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.086
Or maybe
you're just wrong.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.740
Or maybe you're
just being stubborn,

22:30.784 --> 22:32.220
and dragging this out,

22:32.263 --> 22:33.961
making me feel even worse
than I already do.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.615
I would never do that.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.878
But if you know me so well,
how could you make a list

22:37.921 --> 22:40.620
that long and still not know
what's bothering me?

22:40.663 --> 22:42.665
Much less do it
in the first place?

22:42.709 --> 22:44.580
So there is something.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.713
Right. Fine.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.192
But it's not what you think.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.107
So, let's just find
our missing monster

22:50.151 --> 22:51.631
and go home, okay?

22:53.502 --> 22:55.374
Our monster
isn't missing anymore.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.897
[both scream]

22:56.940 --> 22:58.420
He's a show dog.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.552
[woman screams]Super rare.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.292
[man screams][gasps]

23:01.336 --> 23:02.729
Do you want to compel them,
or should I?

23:06.167 --> 23:08.822
[chitters]

23:08.865 --> 23:09.953
[gasps]

23:09.997 --> 23:11.564
LIZZIE:
Good boy.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.392
That's how you play dead.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.306
MG:
Uh, Lizzie?

23:15.350 --> 23:17.744
I don't think he's playing.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.753
Oh, good.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.494
You're back.

23:28.537 --> 23:29.886
I'm sorry about all
the drama earlier.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.149
But I did bring this
as a peace offering.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.847
I mean,

23:33.890 --> 23:35.326
not "peace" with a capital "P."
I think we all know

23:35.370 --> 23:37.285
that's not gonna
happen. I just...

23:37.328 --> 23:40.375
I tend to get a little intense
when it comes to saving Landon.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.943
But it's not gonna be
a problem now.

23:42.986 --> 23:45.032
I'm ready to go home.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.948
[snarling]

23:55.477 --> 23:58.262
Landon? What happened?

23:58.306 --> 23:59.960
[snarls]

24:00.003 --> 24:01.527
I wasn't talking to you.

24:01.570 --> 24:03.354
If you want this, you're
gonna have to release him.

24:03.398 --> 24:04.573
I don't think he needs it.

24:04.617 --> 24:05.661
You also thought The Necromancer

24:05.705 --> 24:06.836
was gonna bring you back home.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.577
He did.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.666
Can I just...

24:10.710 --> 24:13.147
You're choking me.
[grunts]

24:13.190 --> 24:15.541
I have no idea why
The Ferryman brought me

24:15.584 --> 24:17.368
back to Limbo. It obviously
didn't work that way

24:17.412 --> 24:19.545
with Dr. Saltzman.
But I was at the school, Hope.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.547
I know what's
going on, and...

24:21.590 --> 24:24.375
I think I figured out the lesson
we're supposed to learn.

24:24.419 --> 24:25.681
Does that lesson

24:25.725 --> 24:27.291
involve us
leaving Limbo together?

24:29.119 --> 24:31.121
Then I don't want to hear it.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.384
I'm not giving up,
but if you are,

24:33.428 --> 24:34.821
just stay
out of my way

24:34.864 --> 24:35.778
until I can figure out
how to get us both

24:35.822 --> 24:37.084
out of here together.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.437
[growls]

24:44.439 --> 24:46.136
So much for being on my side.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.187
You know, I think you better
let me handle this one.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.321
[thunder rumbles]

24:58.322 --> 24:59.585
That's odd.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.500
There's hardly a cloud
in the sky.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.602
Why must you resist me?

25:16.645 --> 25:17.820
I mustn't.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.256
It's a choice.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.780
So make a different one.

25:20.823 --> 25:23.391
So you have come here
to threaten me, then?

25:23.434 --> 25:24.784
Took longer than I thought.

25:24.827 --> 25:27.047
You misunderstand me.
Which is my fault.

25:28.701 --> 25:31.530
And why I came to apologize.

25:31.573 --> 25:35.969
When I said I could not
return your brother to life,

25:36.012 --> 25:38.275
you assumed it was
beyond my power.

25:38.319 --> 25:41.104
I should have said "would not."

25:41.148 --> 25:42.410
What?

25:43.367 --> 25:45.065
Well, if you can do it,

25:45.108 --> 25:46.588
then why do you refuse?

25:46.632 --> 25:48.547
Gods are meant to rule men.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.810
And from what
you told me of Tristan,

25:50.853 --> 25:52.681
he does not deserve
to live again.

25:52.725 --> 25:55.597
You're a bloody hypocrite.

25:55.641 --> 26:00.254
Your own children have told me
of your cruelty and your malice.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.561
And you believe their stories?

26:02.604 --> 26:04.954
Well, not at first, of course.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.870
But then I experienced
Ben's memories--

26:07.914 --> 26:11.482
his pain and his suffering--
for myself.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.876
You're not the only one
with powers, you know.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.052
A vampire can see
into a person's mind.

26:16.096 --> 26:19.186
Then look into mine and judge
my story for yourself,

26:19.229 --> 26:21.971
as I have judged your brother
through yours.

26:23.277 --> 26:25.627
That kind of judgement,

26:25.671 --> 26:27.629
it's-it's frowned upon
these days.

26:27.673 --> 26:30.110
The modern world
is a more forgiving place.

26:30.153 --> 26:32.678
A pardon
for any transgression,

26:32.721 --> 26:34.288
therapy for any weakness.

26:34.331 --> 26:39.467
No black, no white, all grey.

26:40.686 --> 26:41.991
I'm not really sure

26:42.035 --> 26:43.732
of my place in it all anymore.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.473
Then witness my truth,

26:45.516 --> 26:47.606
and you will be certain
of where you stand.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.623
I told you to stay away.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.495
You aren't gonna ask me
what I saw in the real world?

27:07.538 --> 27:11.238
Not if you use it to try
and convince me what to do.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.066
Our friends need your help.

27:13.109 --> 27:16.722
The last time I helped them,
I died, became the Tribrid,

27:16.765 --> 27:20.029
killed Malivore,
and I became a monster myself.

27:20.073 --> 27:22.249
Just like the universe wanted.

27:22.292 --> 27:25.774
That's not your fate, Hope.

27:25.818 --> 27:28.429
I think that's the lesson
you came here to learn.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.126
And how am I supposed
to do that?

27:32.781 --> 27:36.263
One sentence or less.
I'm trying to get back to work.

27:39.483 --> 27:42.356
You have to go back without me.

27:53.541 --> 27:56.022
You can't ask me to accept that.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.501
Look, I know it's big,
but when I was at the school,

27:57.545 --> 27:59.547
I passed by
Dr. Saltzman's office.

27:59.590 --> 28:00.853
He was on the phone
with Vardemus.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.681
They think Ken is coming back.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.378
For you.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.640
Which is inconvenient,

28:05.684 --> 28:07.250
considering you're
unconscious and all.

28:07.294 --> 28:10.253
Well, then, he's
pretty dumb for a god.

28:10.297 --> 28:11.733
We all know he can't kill me.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.039
Well, it sounds like
he's gonna try.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.301
And the school
is preparing to fight him,

28:14.344 --> 28:16.433
once again, for you.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.652
Then they'll lose.

28:17.696 --> 28:21.047
Yeah. If you are not with them.

28:22.483 --> 28:25.878
Even if I were,

28:25.921 --> 28:27.880
then some of our friends
are gonna die.

28:29.272 --> 28:33.450
Which just means more death,
grief, loss,

28:33.494 --> 28:35.888
that I have to carry with me
for the rest of my life.

28:35.931 --> 28:38.629
We always thought
you were fated to die.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.414
I did.You're still alive.

28:40.457 --> 28:43.373
The Ferryman wouldn't be trying
to send you back if you weren't.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.550
That's the fate
you have to accept, Hope.

28:46.594 --> 28:48.465
To be the one who lives.

28:50.685 --> 28:53.296
I know that's harder.

28:53.340 --> 28:55.429
But you have to go back.

28:59.563 --> 29:02.784
So use this scythe
and please let me help...

29:05.395 --> 29:08.007
...one last time.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.401
ALARIC:
Here's what I don't understand.

29:11.445 --> 29:12.838
Just yesterday,
you sold us out

29:12.881 --> 29:14.361
to break an admittedly
crappy curse,

29:14.404 --> 29:18.844
but now you're willing
to die permanently?

29:20.367 --> 29:23.762
Every one of my countless
deaths has been for nothing.

29:25.720 --> 29:29.202
If this final one means
the end of my father...

29:30.725 --> 29:32.988
...that Jed could be safe?

29:33.032 --> 29:35.251
You got it bad for him, huh?

29:35.295 --> 29:38.733
[laughs softly]Look, you're new here.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.344
Martyrdom, it rarely
works out the way

29:41.388 --> 29:46.045
people who sacrifice themselves
expect it to, trust me.

29:46.088 --> 29:48.177
Says the man who's willing
to let his students

29:48.221 --> 29:51.311
do exactly that
in a fight they can't win?

29:51.354 --> 29:53.530
Because there is
a difference.

29:53.574 --> 29:58.187
In my experience, if something's
worth fighting for,

29:58.231 --> 30:01.234
there's always a chance
that you'll win.

30:01.277 --> 30:03.671
Well, that's optimistic.

30:03.714 --> 30:05.281
Or delusional.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.718
[chuckles]
Well, until recently,

30:07.762 --> 30:11.940
I-I was cynical
and disillusioned.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.637
Uh, the old me would definitely

30:13.681 --> 30:16.031
take you up
on your offer, but...

30:17.990 --> 30:20.775
...I'm beginning to like
the new me much better.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.950
[chuckles]

30:21.994 --> 30:23.343
Even if he's not

30:23.386 --> 30:25.911
so good at walking.

30:25.954 --> 30:29.349
So what does his pure heart
plan on doing with me?

30:29.392 --> 30:31.481
[exhales]
Oh, it's not that pure.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.570
Odds are,
you're still gonna die.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.659
But if you want to get
back at your father

30:35.703 --> 30:37.487
and atone...

30:44.059 --> 30:46.409
...stay alive.

30:46.453 --> 30:49.673
And use your power
to fight with us.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.809
HOPE:
So this is your fate.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.811
Convincing people to move on.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.335
It's usually to Peace,
not the real world.

30:59.379 --> 31:01.903
Yeah, you don't suck at it.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.166
[both laugh softly]

31:04.210 --> 31:05.907
But...

31:05.951 --> 31:08.692
that means you're gonna always
be the one left behind.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.433
Moral victory, at least.

31:13.697 --> 31:16.309
[exhales]

31:16.352 --> 31:19.486
We always thought our fates
were so similar.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.924
You'd always been told
what you're destined to be

31:22.968 --> 31:25.666
your entire life;
I've always had to wonder.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.541
I wish the answer
was being with you, but...

31:31.585 --> 31:33.500
â™ª I want to hold you...

31:33.543 --> 31:36.416
...if it can't be,
at least I know where I belong.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.679
â™ª I just want to hold you...

31:38.722 --> 31:41.334
You won't be alone
where you are.

31:41.377 --> 31:45.512
â™ª I want to hold...

31:45.555 --> 31:47.601
I'm good with it, Hope.

31:47.644 --> 31:50.386
â™ª You...

31:50.430 --> 31:52.171
I'm good.

31:52.214 --> 31:55.391
â™ª You say everyone seems happy

31:55.435 --> 31:57.611
â™ª Everyone except for you...

31:57.654 --> 31:59.482
Then one condition.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.702
It's your turn to stab me,
this time.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.704
â™ª I know it seems that way,
everybody got pain... â™ª

32:03.747 --> 32:06.707
Hope, I don't think I can.

32:06.750 --> 32:09.753
I didn't, either, but
it's like when we stepped

32:09.797 --> 32:11.277
into the Malivore pit.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.366
We'll do it together.

32:14.410 --> 32:15.803
[softly]:
Yeah.

32:15.846 --> 32:19.589
Then all you have to do
is hold on tight.

32:19.633 --> 32:22.636
â™ª You fight through

32:22.679 --> 32:25.987
â™ª I'll stand by you,
ours shall be the same... â™ª

32:26.031 --> 32:28.947
I will always love you.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.862
â™ª I want to hold you...

32:31.906 --> 32:33.995
I'll never forget you.

32:34.039 --> 32:37.042
â™ª Just want to hold you

32:37.085 --> 32:40.480
â™ª Your hand

32:40.523 --> 32:42.308
â™ª Reach out

32:42.351 --> 32:45.050
â™ª Your hand

32:45.093 --> 32:47.226
â™ª Reach out

32:47.269 --> 32:49.271
â™ª Your hand

32:49.315 --> 32:51.230
â™ª Reach out.

32:58.324 --> 33:01.980
I thought I was a brutish
and unreasonable tyrant.

33:02.023 --> 33:05.809
But compared to you,
I'm a bloody prince!

33:05.853 --> 33:07.855
LANDON: Trust me,
he can hear you.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.944
All of Limbo can hear you.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.776
Landon Kirby.
[chuckles]

33:15.819 --> 33:17.691
I was cursing
that slippery skeleton

33:17.734 --> 33:20.172
for whisking your mother
to Peace at your behest.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.609
But I suppose him
bringing you back here

33:22.652 --> 33:25.177
is of some consolation,
isn't it?

33:25.220 --> 33:26.961
Misery loves company.
Now get out of my way.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.442
You're not the only person
who has a bone to pick with him.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.444
Plenty to choose from, at least.

33:32.793 --> 33:34.621
I did what I told you I'd do.

33:34.664 --> 33:36.144
Hope's home. Now why
can't I be there with her?

33:36.188 --> 33:37.841
Why'd you break
your own damn rules?

33:46.285 --> 33:48.330
Is that what I think it is?

33:48.374 --> 33:50.158
Indeed.

33:50.202 --> 33:54.032
It's the contract that blasted
jinni made us sign.

33:54.075 --> 33:57.165
It seems some of the terms
have been altered.

33:57.209 --> 34:00.864
Which would explain
your unceremonious return.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.779
The Ferryman

34:02.823 --> 34:04.564
sent Zied to Peace.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.783
In exchange for the rights
to our souls

34:06.827 --> 34:09.134
in perpetuity?

34:09.177 --> 34:12.833
Ah! Read the
fine print.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.269
It's not our souls.

34:14.313 --> 34:15.879
It's yours.

34:19.144 --> 34:22.625
[cackling]

34:37.205 --> 34:38.946
MG:
I'm ready for this
day to be over.

34:40.948 --> 34:46.214
I went to bury the Pukwudgie,
and it dematerialized.

34:46.258 --> 34:48.869
It just disappeared
in my hands.

34:48.912 --> 34:50.653
But at least now I
don't have to hide

34:50.697 --> 34:52.394
the body from Pedro.

34:54.048 --> 34:56.616
You and I are both pretty good
at hiding things

34:56.659 --> 34:58.139
when the need arises.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.359
So, while we wait
to find out

35:00.402 --> 35:03.101
how similar Ethan's
body chemistry is

35:03.144 --> 35:05.668
to our former
four-legged friend,

35:05.712 --> 35:07.235
let's break the cycle.

35:08.584 --> 35:10.151
What were you gonna
say to me earlier?

35:10.195 --> 35:12.414
It's-it's nothing.

35:12.458 --> 35:13.894
Then I take it back.

35:13.937 --> 35:15.417
You suck at hiding things.

35:15.461 --> 35:17.811
I-I just...

35:19.769 --> 35:22.511
I'm not sure
that it's the right time,

35:22.555 --> 35:25.775
considering the circumstances.

35:25.819 --> 35:28.778
Is there ever a right time
around here?

35:29.910 --> 35:31.041
If there was,
we wouldn't be having

35:31.085 --> 35:33.000
this conversation right now.

35:36.873 --> 35:38.179
â™ª It's dark...

35:38.223 --> 35:39.833
Because honestly?

35:39.876 --> 35:43.228
It's the opposite of nothing.

35:43.271 --> 35:44.881
It's everything.

35:44.925 --> 35:48.102
That's what you are to me,
and I have been waiting years

35:48.146 --> 35:51.018
to tell you and I could spend
even more telling you why.

35:51.061 --> 35:54.587
But it seems that there's
always something in the way.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.719
Sebastian, Alyssa,

35:56.763 --> 35:58.765
Malivore, the-the Merge.

35:58.808 --> 36:00.201
All those things are gone now.

36:00.245 --> 36:01.681
Ethan isn't.

36:01.724 --> 36:03.639
And when your back
was against the wall,

36:03.683 --> 36:07.208
when you really needed someone,
you went to him.

36:07.252 --> 36:10.211
That's why you're mad?Not even.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.213
E's the best guy I know.

36:12.257 --> 36:15.695
I don't blame you or anything,
it just...

36:15.738 --> 36:17.523
it hurts.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.351
â™ª Weight is getting heavy...

36:19.394 --> 36:21.440
'Cause I kind of hoped
that it would be me.

36:21.483 --> 36:22.832
â™ª Wasn't meant to stand...

36:22.876 --> 36:24.356
Because it has...

36:24.399 --> 36:25.879
â™ª I turned this love...

36:25.922 --> 36:29.578
...and always will be you,
Lizzie Saltzman.

36:29.622 --> 36:32.712
And I don't even remember
anything on that list,

36:32.755 --> 36:35.367
any of the bad things
you've said or done.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.239
Because I love you...

36:38.283 --> 36:40.023
â™ª Happier with someone else...

36:40.067 --> 36:43.375
...with all of my heart
and all of my soul.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.681
â™ª Before I turn your heart...

36:45.725 --> 36:48.206
And that's all I got to say.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.208
[liquid burbling]

36:50.251 --> 36:53.428
â™ª So I can tear it all down...

36:53.472 --> 36:57.432
I'm guessing that's not good?

36:57.476 --> 36:58.955
Worse.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.263
My theory was right.

37:02.307 --> 37:05.223
The Pukwudgie's powers
are finite.

37:05.266 --> 37:06.920
Its life span only lasts

37:06.963 --> 37:10.184
as long as its powers do,
and the more it phases,

37:10.228 --> 37:11.881
the quicker it dies.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.407
All right, let's-let's not
get ahead of ourselves

37:15.450 --> 37:18.410
until we, until we test
Ethan's blood.

37:18.453 --> 37:20.673
MG.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.762
That was Ethan's blood.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.766
AURORA:
I've seen enough.

37:26.809 --> 37:29.508
[sniffles]
Please put me down.

37:32.424 --> 37:34.034
[crying softly]

37:34.077 --> 37:37.385
Your children lied to me.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.300
And to you.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.259
They painted
you as a coward

37:41.302 --> 37:43.086
and a tyrant but you're nothing
of the sort.

37:43.130 --> 37:46.089
I was a father.

37:46.133 --> 37:49.789
Determined to protect
his family from Malivore.

37:49.832 --> 37:52.618
At least, the ones he hadn't
already consumed.

37:52.661 --> 37:55.447
I was so intent on destroying
him that I was blind

37:55.490 --> 37:59.842
to the true enemy in
my midst: my daughter.

37:59.886 --> 38:03.498
Jen tricked me
and the rest of her siblings,

38:03.542 --> 38:06.109
and thus, I was imprisoned.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.981
Powerless to stop Malivore

38:08.024 --> 38:10.200
from ruining the world
I had conquered.

38:10.244 --> 38:12.855
To keep those
I loved safe.

38:12.899 --> 38:16.250
Now you understand why I will
not make that mistake again.

38:17.556 --> 38:20.167
[sniffles]
Nor will I.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.517
I now see
Tristan's actions--

38:22.561 --> 38:24.432
locking me away, his betrayals,
his manipulations--

38:24.476 --> 38:26.782
for what they were.

38:26.826 --> 38:29.785
As I've seen your story,
through your eyes.

38:29.829 --> 38:32.484
Does that mean you will help me
restore order to this world?

38:38.185 --> 38:39.926
[exhales]

38:41.580 --> 38:43.756
It's a confusing
place to be in, really.

38:46.149 --> 38:48.413
Is my mind sick,

38:48.456 --> 38:50.893
or is it just another
lie I've been told?

38:53.548 --> 38:55.594
Well, go on,
render your judgement.

38:55.637 --> 39:00.381
Our stories are so similar,

39:00.425 --> 39:02.252
to judge you
would be to judge myself,

39:02.296 --> 39:04.080
and even a god cannot do that.

39:04.124 --> 39:05.560
Then who judges the gods?

39:07.040 --> 39:08.781
In this moment,
that falls to you.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.001
I came back to this world

39:12.045 --> 39:15.614
with a simple want: revenge.

39:15.657 --> 39:18.399
When you've been lost in
the woods as long as I have,

39:18.443 --> 39:21.533
you must stop
walking in circles.

39:24.100 --> 39:29.758
The only way out is to choose
a path and walk boldly in it.

39:32.848 --> 39:36.461
I will help you
kill the Tribrid.

39:36.504 --> 39:38.201
May anyone who
think us wrong

39:38.245 --> 39:40.203
have the power to stop us.

39:40.247 --> 39:42.423
Trial by combat.

39:42.467 --> 39:43.946
For this is the way
of royalty

39:43.990 --> 39:45.470
and the gods.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.387
All that remains
to seal our union...

39:51.301 --> 39:52.694
...is a kiss.

39:58.352 --> 40:00.398
If you insist.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.708
ALARIC:
That's a bold move.

40:06.752 --> 40:09.668
BEN:
It must be bold if we intend
to defeat my father.

40:09.711 --> 40:12.845
Now move the phallus to C7.

40:12.888 --> 40:15.456
The rook is my daughter.

40:21.375 --> 40:24.160
Your very dead daughter.

40:24.204 --> 40:25.945
As are all the rest.

40:25.988 --> 40:27.990
Hundredth time's
the charm, right?

40:29.078 --> 40:30.776
Let's run it again.

40:31.864 --> 40:33.039
HOPE:
You're not using your queen.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.002
That's a big mistake.

40:40.046 --> 40:43.005
Everyone knows
she's the most dangerous piece.

40:43.049 --> 40:44.659
Well, she wasn't on the board...

40:45.791 --> 40:47.140
...until now.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.708
Ben's on our side, too.

40:49.751 --> 40:51.187
I think.

40:52.885 --> 40:55.148
And he was just leaving.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.807
I take it
this is going

41:01.850 --> 41:03.939
as well as it did the last time?

41:03.983 --> 41:07.377
Well, Ben has increased
our win probability to...

41:07.421 --> 41:09.075
five percent.

41:09.118 --> 41:10.468
[laughs softly]

41:10.511 --> 41:11.730
How'd you sleep?

41:11.773 --> 41:13.340
Mm, like the dead.

41:14.646 --> 41:16.125
Landon says hi.

41:16.169 --> 41:18.258
You were in Limbo?

41:18.301 --> 41:19.999
It's a long story.

41:20.042 --> 41:23.655
The moral of which is...

41:23.698 --> 41:26.919
that there are some battles
we can't win alone.

41:33.665 --> 41:35.841
It's good
to have you back, Hope.

41:37.886 --> 41:39.888
Your move.
