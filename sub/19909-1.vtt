01:06.960 --> 01:09.191
'My dear nephew...

01:10.440 --> 01:12.511
'...as your uncle and guardian,

01:12.640 --> 01:15.678
'my task is to inform you

01:15.800 --> 01:20.591
'that is now time for you
to return home to Bechuanaland.

01:21.560 --> 01:25.315
'To use the knowledge that you have
gained from your time in England

01:25.440 --> 01:28.558
'to ensure the advancement of our people,

01:28.680 --> 01:30.637
'our nation.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.800
'You left a boy,
now you must return a man.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.752
'Arrangements have begun.

01:37.880 --> 01:42.750
'I am filled with joy
for our reunion and our future.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.439
<i>'Pula.'</i>

01:58.720 --> 02:01.792
Seretse, are you okay? Teach him a lesson.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.354
You monkey!

02:22.720 --> 02:24.439
You didn't see that coming.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.759
- That was not a fair fight.
- You were too predictable.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.272
Come on. We'll be late for class.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.438
# I'm going nowhere, getting no place

02:37.600 --> 02:39.717
# Making no time with nobody

02:40.840 --> 02:42.115
# No, baby

02:42.240 --> 02:44.436
# Nobody, but you...

02:47.720 --> 02:49.120
Can you draw up my dress?

02:50.200 --> 02:51.953
I saw Teddy at the bus stop.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.316
He's been so down,
since you ended it with him.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.717
Oh, well, he knows it's for the best.
We wanted different things.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.198
Is that what you're wearing tonight?

03:00.320 --> 03:02.789
Muriel, I can't go
to the Missionary Society dance.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.759
- They're your friends, not mine.
- Oh, come on.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.918
'Indians will go to their beds
as subjects of the Queen,

03:09.120 --> 03:10.440
'and awake to a new day.'

03:10.600 --> 03:13.718
The next day they'll awake to wish
we were running the place again.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.760
Bye.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.318
- See you later.
- Are you going, Ruth?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.112
- Yes, Dad.
- What for?

03:25.240 --> 03:26.594
She's keeping me company.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.113
- Well, mind yourselves.
- Hmm, don't come back a missionary.

03:39.640 --> 03:44.999
Ah, Muriel! Thank you.
We are a little short this evening.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.351
Oh, I've brought my sister, Ruth.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.318
How nice of you to come.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.880
Oh!

03:52.000 --> 03:54.595
- Would you like to dance with me?
- Of course, Ade.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.399
It would never happen. It's futile.

03:59.689 --> 04:01.045
So, there'll be bloodshed.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.959
A fight doesn't always
have to be about violence.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.237
Understand the imperialist mind,

04:06.400 --> 04:07.880
and you can outmanoeuvre it.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.992
Isn't that why we are all here?

04:10.120 --> 04:13.875
There is an Africa that doesn't have
to be about white or black exclusion.

04:14.680 --> 04:18.310
An Africa that is about
unity, inclusion and equality.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.236
That's the original idealist!

04:25.080 --> 04:26.434
Would you like to dance?

04:27.720 --> 04:29.200
Thank you very much.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.192
What's this song supposed to be?

04:53.360 --> 04:55.750
I don't know,
but they are utterly butchering it.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.600
I've been trying to work out the melody
since they began.

04:59.985 --> 05:01.916
Sorry. I...

05:02.000 --> 05:05.437
I do love jazz, but I've never trusted
an Englishman to play it.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.193
Would you like to dance?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.671
Rather lively, wasn't it?

05:16.640 --> 05:18.871
It was good fun. Where's he from?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.957
Oh, everybody adores Seretse.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.679
He's over from Bechuanaland.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.395
- What's he studying?
- Law. Like the rest.

05:49.320 --> 05:53.917
Just looking at this claim. A small error,
if you could just do it again...

06:03.160 --> 06:04.514
Hmm.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.917
Oh, there's a parcel for you over there.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.993
Who is Mr Khama?

06:19.160 --> 06:20.435
Oh, my goodness.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.390
# I'm gone buzzin'...

06:24.560 --> 06:25.914
Ruth!

06:29.640 --> 06:32.758
He's invited me to a dance.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.756
He says he can get another ticket
if you'd like to take me.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.111
I wouldn't like to take you.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.551
I haven't danced like that
since I left home.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.831
Well, then I'm so pleased
we're doing this.

07:09.960 --> 07:13.590
I'm so pleased to have agreed to come to
a dance with a man I know nothing about!

07:16.840 --> 07:18.559
Who are you, Mr Khama?

07:19.240 --> 07:20.799
Well, I, uh...

07:21.560 --> 07:24.837
I grew up with my little sister, Naledi.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.874
Our mother and father died
when... I was three.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.354
Oh, that's...

07:30.520 --> 07:32.716
Oh, no, no, no.
We, we were raised by my uncle.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.912
He's like a father to us.
We've been very fortunate.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.357
How about you? If I...

07:40.520 --> 07:44.116
If I were to ask you to tell me something
about you I couldn't possibly guess?

07:45.400 --> 07:47.835
We were evacuated to the countryside,
Muriel and I,

07:47.960 --> 07:50.600
but I couldn't bear the boredom.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.599
So I asked them
to take me at Friston, the airfield.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.439
I drove the crash ambulance for them.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.871
Ferrying the injured fighter pilots.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.592
I looked it up, you know, your country.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.833
The size of France
and 121,000 inhabitants.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.191
And one of the poorest countries
in the world.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.674
Is that right?

08:21.960 --> 08:25.431
We asked for the protection
of Queen Victoria.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.195
And she agreed. Eventually.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.950
It was that, or face invasion
from a racialist South Africa.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.796
- Sounds like no choice at all.
- What is the saying?

08:36.919 --> 08:40.630
"No man is free,
who is not master of himself."

08:46.000 --> 08:47.753
I wish we could see the stars.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.716
They take your breath away
back in Bechuanaland.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.396
It never fails to astonish me.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.432
You are cold.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.913
We should stop here.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.990
My father, he wouldn't approve.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.672
I'm just two streets away.
Can we do this again?

09:34.200 --> 09:35.554
I mean, meet?

09:35.680 --> 09:37.239
Is that too forward of me?

09:37.360 --> 09:38.714
No.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.311
- No, it...
- What?

09:44.520 --> 09:45.795
Queen Victoria...

09:47.440 --> 09:50.751
The man who negotiated for
her protection of Bechuanaland...

09:52.560 --> 09:54.074
he was my grandfather.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.714
A king.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.553
I am his heir.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.232
For more than 20 years, my uncle
has been on the throne as regent

10:06.360 --> 10:08.352
preparing me to rule.

10:10.160 --> 10:13.153
My education is now complete,

10:13.280 --> 10:15.397
and it is time for me to return.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.957
Oh. I see.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.876
Thank you. Thank you for explaining.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.313
Not simply disappearing.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.919
I quite understand.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.919
I have had a wonderful evening.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.200
Ruth.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.431
No, I-I-I don't think you do understand.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.912
I don't know what happened tonight.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.795
But I do know that I would hate to walk
away from you here in this moment,

10:54.920 --> 10:56.957
knowing that I wouldn't see you again.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.360
Well, then you must.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.679
See me again, I mean.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.191
Uh, Mr Khama?

11:43.840 --> 11:45.240
Thank you.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.755
Father will hate him on sight.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.315
He's clever than him and he's black.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.991
- Oh!
- Yes, yes, yes!

12:11.560 --> 12:13.119
Have you ever been in love?

12:17.040 --> 12:18.394
No.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.109
And then Ruth Williams came along.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.034
Look, it's a coon.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.594
Out of the zoo for a night.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.080
- Scum!
- Ignore him.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.317
Look who's talking! Cheap slut!

12:37.600 --> 12:39.159
- That's enough.
- Yeah?

12:39.280 --> 12:41.556
- Seretse...
- Don't!

12:42.040 --> 12:44.600
- Ruth...
- Oi! Get your black hands off what's ours!

12:44.720 --> 12:46.074
I'm not yours!

12:47.760 --> 12:49.717
Stop it! Get off him.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.797
Seretse...

12:51.920 --> 12:53.400
Black bastard!

12:56.000 --> 12:59.914
Move back!

13:00.040 --> 13:01.360
Savage!

13:06.240 --> 13:07.560
Oh, Ruth.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.869
They're yobs.
You can't let them get to you.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.038
No, I'm not even giving them
a second thought.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.360
Then what is it?

13:26.840 --> 13:28.354
It scares me a bit.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.719
The way he makes me feel.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.195
Ruth, he has to go back
to his own country.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.754
I know.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.875
Just let me enjoy it while it lasts.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.798
- Am I late?
- No. No, not at all.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.274
Is something the matter?

14:08.080 --> 14:12.120
I have been... thinking
about my responsibilities

14:12.240 --> 14:14.391
back home in Bechuanaland.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.880
There is so much that I need to do there.

14:23.600 --> 14:27.640
But I know that I will never
achieve anything worthwhile...

14:29.080 --> 14:32.630
...if I leave my heart here.

14:34.360 --> 14:37.910
Uh, I'm not asking for an answer
this, this very second.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.200
All I, all I ask of you is that you...

14:42.200 --> 14:44.157
...go away and, and think about it,

14:44.280 --> 14:48.274
because, uh, there...
there is a lot to think about.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.832
And...

15:03.800 --> 15:05.996
I don't need to think about it.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.600
I know I love you.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.193
And I know what you're asking.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.519
What it means.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.314
And yes.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.079
Yes.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.714
Yes, Seretse, I will marry you.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.720
White? British? Oh, God.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.513
And she's a salesman's daughter!

15:39.640 --> 15:42.758
I don't care if her mother sells fish
in the market! I love her!

15:42.880 --> 15:45.440
Aren't you supposed
to ask for your uncle's consent

15:45.600 --> 15:47.000
before you ask for her hand?

15:47.160 --> 15:48.514
And your people?

16:02.760 --> 16:04.160
'Dear Uncle...

16:05.360 --> 16:07.750
'...I realise this won't please you.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.872
'You and the tribe won't like it.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.234
'I have asked an Englishwoman to marry me.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.640
'A white woman.'

16:24.160 --> 16:25.435
It will not happen.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.394
It will.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.311
What in God's name is wrong with you?

16:33.960 --> 16:36.316
At least Muriel
only wants to convert them!

16:38.320 --> 16:39.390
I've said yes.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.716
- She might change her mind, George.
- She won't!

16:43.560 --> 16:45.916
Mum, I've met the man
I want to spend my life with.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.760
And how many other wives
do you think he's already got, eh?

16:49.800 --> 16:52.360
- You disgust me.
- George, don't.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.352
You think about this, Ruth.

16:54.520 --> 16:58.912
You marry a black,
you make it impossible for us.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.072
For your mother, for Muriel.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.434
You may choose
a life of insults and shame...

17:07.560 --> 17:08.914
...but what about us?

17:10.599 --> 17:12.034
We've only ever loved you.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.520
Father...

17:15.359 --> 17:16.919
I can't see you again.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.434
Not if you choose him.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.354
This... is not how I wanted it to be.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.318
You separated from your family.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.273
I have fears, Ruth.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.790
Not just about this, but... my uncle.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.754
You can't take us all this way
to tell me you have fears!

17:46.880 --> 17:48.360
Not for me, for you!

17:48.520 --> 17:50.955
For everything
I am asking you to sacrifice.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.716
Can you... even imagine a life in Africa?

17:57.400 --> 17:58.754
Yes.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.358
We'll take it moment by moment, won't we?

18:07.600 --> 18:08.920
Together.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.875
Morning, ladies.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.390
An early tea break for you all.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.879
I need to speak to Miss Williams.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.999
Ruth, uh, there's a gentleman to see you.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.439
Good morning.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.398
I'll leave you to it.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.957
Sir Alistair Canning.

18:38.120 --> 18:41.511
I am the British Government
representative in southern Africa.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.235
And yet I find myself in London today.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.839
Because it is my duty to inform you

18:46.960 --> 18:49.395
that Mr Seretse Khama
has been gravely mistaken

18:49.560 --> 18:52.598
in believing he may take you as his wife.

18:53.520 --> 18:56.797
A marriage between you cannot take place.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.432
A chief cannot simply come to London,

18:59.600 --> 19:02.832
and pluck a girl out of a typing pool.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.360
I'm not a typist.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.153
Any union between you and Mr Khama
will have implications

19:10.280 --> 19:15.036
for the not-insignificant neighbouring
countries of Bechuanaland.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.429
Not least South Africa,

19:16.600 --> 19:21.629
the prime minister of which is currently
enshrining into law the policy of...

19:25.080 --> 19:26.639
The policy of apartheid.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.194
Do you know this word?

19:31.920 --> 19:33.240
No.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.119
No. Well, it is this...

19:38.360 --> 19:41.273
The black must live separately
from the white.

19:42.040 --> 19:46.034
He must attend
his own school, hospital, church,

19:46.200 --> 19:50.399
and he must never conjoin
with a white woman.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.874
Your entry in Africa with him

19:53.000 --> 19:57.756
would be seen as a flagrant disregard
for the current political climate.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.437
It would be an act more powerful
than your limited experience

20:02.600 --> 20:04.592
will allow you to comprehend.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.275
We have already heard the presidents
of South Africa, southwest Africa

20:09.400 --> 20:11.232
and the Rhodesias.

20:11.360 --> 20:15.149
Yet all demanding that
this marriage not take place.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.954
As a matter of diplomatic necessity.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.794
I take it you need no more from me

20:21.920 --> 20:24.230
to confirm that
you will not marry this man.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.831
I will confirm nothing of the kind.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.793
Have you no shame?

20:43.440 --> 20:46.638
The British administration may dictate
many things in my country,

20:46.760 --> 20:48.956
but they will not dictate who I marry.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.680
They are trying to define us,
based on their rules,

20:52.800 --> 20:55.031
their idea of the world,
and how they see it.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.317
Seretse, do you hear yourself?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.993
These men are at the very top
of government. They're powerful.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.629
- Muriel, stop interfering.
- Stop it! Both of you!

21:08.720 --> 21:10.234
Ruth...

21:11.320 --> 21:13.277
Father won't talk to you.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.040
You're called a whore in the street,
and now this.

21:16.920 --> 21:19.116
You know how much I love Seretse.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.196
But you don't have to do this.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.520
Muriel, I've never wanted anything
like I want this.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.400
Enter.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.234
Sir.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.920
Mr Khama.

21:54.360 --> 21:55.680
Good morning.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.434
Sir Alistair Canning.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.829
How do you do?

21:59.960 --> 22:03.636
I believe you've met my fiancÃ©e,
Ruth Williams.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.160
- Indeed.
- Sir.

22:05.880 --> 22:09.430
We are told you can provide us
with some information, Sir Alistair.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.159
Well, if I can,

22:12.000 --> 22:13.957
then I most certainly will.

22:14.760 --> 22:19.118
Who exactly has asked you to
interfere with my wish to marry?

22:20.360 --> 22:23.273
I will tell you... exactly.

22:25.240 --> 22:28.711
I received advice
from the Archbishop of Canterbury,

22:28.840 --> 22:32.834
who was instructed by the Secretary
of State for Commonwealth Affairs,

22:32.960 --> 22:37.398
who was himself instructed
by the solicitor, Douglas Buchanan,

22:38.320 --> 22:41.791
who was, in turn,
instructed by his client,

22:41.920 --> 22:44.992
your uncle, Tshekedi Khama.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.320
So, you see...

22:49.880 --> 22:52.952
...everyone here, and in southern Africa,

22:53.840 --> 22:58.232
is acting entirely according
to the wishes... of your uncle.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.880
I knew he wouldn't take it well,
that he'd be angry with me,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.310
but why is he allowing himself
to be used by them?

23:05.440 --> 23:07.750
It's only you and I
who want us to be together.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.280
No one else.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.075
You are the only one
I want to spend my life with.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.989
There's nothing in law
that says we cannot marry.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.713
Have you got the rings?

23:33.960 --> 23:36.839
It is with pleasure
I pronounce you man and wife.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.837
May I offer you my congratulations?

23:49.040 --> 23:50.918
Thank you so much.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.160
Mrs Khama...

24:52.680 --> 24:55.240
Mrs Khama, do you intend
to learn the native language?

24:55.400 --> 24:58.313
- I will try, yes.
- And I will give her plenty of help.

24:58.520 --> 25:02.594
Mr Khama, I hear your tribe are rebelling
against you bringing a white queen home,

25:02.720 --> 25:04.598
according to South Africa this morning.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.229
South Africa has her own agenda.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.431
Perhaps you should report on that.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.193
Thank you. That'll be all.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.194
Rebelling?

25:18.360 --> 25:21.080
It's exaggeration. It has to be.

25:23.200 --> 25:27.194
'Bechuanaland chief from the southern
African British protectorate...'

25:27.320 --> 25:30.358
'Office girl, Ruth Khama,
will travel to Africa...'

25:30.520 --> 25:33.160
'Bechuanaland will meet
their new queen...'

26:04.440 --> 26:08.070
Mrs Khama... welcome.

26:12.760 --> 26:15.116
Will your family be coming to visit?

26:16.654 --> 26:17.907
Sir.

26:23.800 --> 26:27.237
Sir Alistair Canning
wants to meet before I see my uncle.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.000
Good afternoon, sir.

27:12.960 --> 27:16.271
I have special dispensation as the king.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.676
But we use a different entrance.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.320
Mr and Mrs Khama.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.431
Welcome, Mrs Khama.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.353
Thank you.

27:40.520 --> 27:43.672
We didn't want to leave it too long
before Ruth could see her new home.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.711
What would you like to drink, Mrs Khama?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.593
Gin and lime would be lovely.

27:49.720 --> 27:51.837
We have lemonade for you, Mr Khama.

27:52.600 --> 27:56.230
You are aware of the prohibition
of alcohol for blacks in Bechuanaland?

27:58.840 --> 28:01.992
Well, if my husband is having lemonade,
then I will have lemonade.

28:03.520 --> 28:07.992
Ah, here he is! It's our new district
commissioner, Mr Rufus Lancaster.

28:08.200 --> 28:09.600
How do you do, Mr Khama?

28:09.720 --> 28:11.074
A pleasure.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.872
- Mrs Khama.
- How do you do?

28:15.280 --> 28:17.112
Let me pour you that lemonade.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.872
I've asked Mr Lancaster along

28:21.000 --> 28:23.231
to give you an assessment of affairs
in Serowe,

28:23.360 --> 28:27.240
in light of your meeting at the kgotla,
Mr Khama.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.596
You would like to tell me
how my people are feeling?

28:30.720 --> 28:34.509
80% of the people
support your uncle's refusal

28:34.640 --> 28:37.235
to accept your wife
as queen of your tribe.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.839
May I ask how you arrived
at that figure, Mr Lancaster?

28:42.960 --> 28:46.271
We are recommending that you resign
any claim to the chieftainship,

28:46.400 --> 28:49.313
and that you announce that fact
to your tribe with a meeting.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.274
The kgotla, Sir Alistair,

28:55.400 --> 28:58.120
is the place where
our tribal decisions are made,

28:58.240 --> 29:01.677
where every man has his say.

29:01.800 --> 29:06.397
There, and only there, can the support or
dissatisfaction of my people be measured.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.031
Where they will decide whether
they wish for me to remain king.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.671
I believe you call it democracy.

29:15.440 --> 29:19.036
Mr Khama, you understand
the risks you're taking.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.590
You're forcing the tribe to take sides.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.757
This could cause a dangerous divide.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.759
Make your country... ungovernable.

29:28.440 --> 29:32.116
And it would open up South Africa's
claim to annex Bechuanaland.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.270
Britain has long prevented it.

29:36.440 --> 29:38.159
But for how much longer?

29:39.880 --> 29:41.997
Lancaster just about got
through the evening

29:42.160 --> 29:44.755
without calling me an ungrateful nigger.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.559
Can they really hand over
an entire country just like that?

29:51.760 --> 29:53.114
They wouldn't risk it.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.518
Malan's regime has very little support
from the British public.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.119
But you're worried.

30:02.160 --> 30:05.710
You know, I've seen the news reels.
I know what's happening in South Africa.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.793
It's poison,
and it's already affecting you here.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.429
That sign outside.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.239
You have those in England too.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.635
I know.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.795
No blacks, no Irish, no dogs.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.871
But I didn't expect it
in your own country.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.560
Come.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.797
It's your first night in Bechuanaland.
I don't want you to be sad.

30:46.120 --> 30:50.160
Let us not allow
the ugliness of this world

30:50.280 --> 30:51.999
to take our joy away from us.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.915
Another!

31:25.360 --> 31:27.033
Oh...

31:27.200 --> 31:29.431
- Shh, shh.
- What?

31:29.600 --> 31:33.116
Can you hear that?
It's the music from the bar.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.439
Dance with me.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.237
Whoo! Oh!

31:48.960 --> 31:50.314
What...? Ah!

32:33.600 --> 32:35.034
My home.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.360
Our home.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.911
White woman.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.353
Is that your mother?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.720
Uh, no.
No, that is my Uncle Tshekedi's mother.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.720
That is me on the day he became a regent.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.357
Uncle... this is Ruth.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.716
I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.717
I will speak to my nephew alone.

34:40.880 --> 34:43.679
Refreshments will be provided
for her in the house.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.911
Over two decades of preparing you
to be our king,

34:55.080 --> 34:56.911
and this is how you face me.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.799
A white woman by your side.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.191
- Uncle...
- Are you trying to tear us apart?

35:10.440 --> 35:13.319
I am Naledi, Seretse's sister.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.639
Naledi.

35:15.760 --> 35:18.594
- Seretse's told me so much.
- Please don't.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.279
Why would you do this to us?

35:22.440 --> 35:24.193
To yourself?

35:24.320 --> 35:27.757
Be somewhere and be something
that makes no sense to you?

35:29.800 --> 35:31.598
Look at them.

35:31.720 --> 35:33.598
They are fighting because of you.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.440
I mean you no harm.

35:38.960 --> 35:44.115
Do you understand what mother,
<i>mother,</i> of our nation means?

35:49.080 --> 35:52.676
I married Seretse's uncle
knowing my responsibility.

35:53.840 --> 35:58.437
That one day Seretse's wife
would be chosen from our nation,

35:58.600 --> 36:00.432
and I would hand over to her.

36:01.160 --> 36:05.279
We have waited years for the day
we would see her rule by his side.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.315
Your first duty is to your people.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.920
Your nation.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.273
Seretse, you're a son to me.

36:16.520 --> 36:19.592
Please... be my son.

36:22.680 --> 36:26.560
I will entertain you in my home,
if that is my husband's wish.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.516
But don't insult us.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.199
It's...

36:32.160 --> 36:35.198
...audacious of you to come here,

36:35.360 --> 36:36.999
and present yourself married,

36:37.160 --> 36:39.629
as if it were your right to be our queen.

36:40.320 --> 36:43.358
Who do you think will accept you? The men?

36:45.240 --> 36:48.278
- I...
- Us? The women?

36:49.280 --> 36:51.590
To have a white woman who we must love

36:51.720 --> 36:54.633
and trust and respect as our sovereign?

36:59.520 --> 37:01.113
Whoo.

37:01.240 --> 37:04.233
You belong to the whites,
but they won't want you, either.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.873
You insult us all.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.159
Let him go.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.554
We need him more than you.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.989
You will obey me,
and you will divorce her!

37:26.320 --> 37:27.674
No, sir.

37:28.600 --> 37:29.875
I will not.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.238
Then listen to me, boy.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.236
You will stand up
in the kgotla tomorrow...

37:51.640 --> 37:53.836
...and you will renounce your birthright.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.871
And any right to the throne.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.238
We've misjudged this, haven't we?

38:58.520 --> 39:01.513
Would the British have accepted it

39:01.640 --> 39:06.556
if Princess Elizabeth had come here,
and taken one of us

39:06.680 --> 39:08.512
as her husband?

39:10.040 --> 39:12.839
A negro king of England. Can you imagine?

39:14.240 --> 39:16.311
She would have been refused!

39:17.120 --> 39:20.397
Every right on her claim to the throne
removed from her!

39:21.200 --> 39:23.840
Just as we must refuse my nephew here!

39:24.640 --> 39:28.077
If he does not divorce this white woman!

39:29.960 --> 39:33.397
Seretse... honour your people.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.276
Do not belittle your kingdom!

40:02.520 --> 40:08.676
Over there in the royal burial
ground lies my father...

40:09.960 --> 40:14.239
...his father and his father before him.

40:15.960 --> 40:19.237
If I had married a woman
of my uncle's choosing,

40:19.400 --> 40:23.189
he would, this day,
proudly be confirming me king,

40:23.320 --> 40:25.232
and the line of royal succession,

40:25.360 --> 40:26.714
centuries old,

40:26.840 --> 40:28.911
would remain unbroken.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.156
I am proud of my lineage,

40:32.280 --> 40:34.670
and I respect my uncle.

40:35.720 --> 40:40.351
But he does not have the right
to decide on my succession to the throne.

40:41.400 --> 40:44.552
I believe the people, and only the people,

40:45.400 --> 40:47.631
should have that right.

40:47.760 --> 40:51.515
My commitment to you has never diminished.

40:53.040 --> 40:56.112
But I am told that you no longer
wish for me to honour my duty

40:56.240 --> 40:57.879
to serve you as your king

40:58.000 --> 41:00.560
because of the colour of the wife
I have chosen.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.916
South Africa's racialist disease

41:05.080 --> 41:09.916
has infected
all our neighbouring countries and us.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.434
Look around you.

41:12.160 --> 41:15.073
Our schools, hospitals, churches

41:15.200 --> 41:18.796
all segregated in practice, if not in law.

41:19.360 --> 41:24.719
Are we now to uphold the abomination
that is apartheid in our own kgotla?

41:25.840 --> 41:30.153
The very same abomination that
has been oppressing us for decades?

41:30.920 --> 41:34.118
Is this to be the future for our Africa?

41:36.320 --> 41:39.631
We should not be fighting for segregation.

41:40.760 --> 41:43.434
We should be fighting for equality.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.240
That is where we should be
focusing our minds,

41:46.360 --> 41:50.673
not on the wife I have chosen,
who means you no harm,

41:50.800 --> 41:53.713
whose only apparent crime

41:53.840 --> 41:55.991
has been to fall in love with me!

41:57.320 --> 41:59.835
And mine to fall in love with her.

42:07.280 --> 42:10.159
I cannot serve you without her by my side.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.516
But I cannot force you to accept this.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.396
Africa can never be free,

42:18.560 --> 42:22.270
until all those who live in her,
white and black,

42:22.400 --> 42:28.192
recognise that race must have
no bearing on equality and justice.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.517
I am ready to serve you

42:31.640 --> 42:34.109
because I love my people.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.438
I love this land!

42:40.760 --> 42:42.558
But I love my wife.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.754
And I shall respect your will.

43:17.640 --> 43:20.030
Those who want Seretse as king,

43:20.160 --> 43:21.719
raise your hand.

43:52.760 --> 43:56.800
<i>Pula! Pula!</i>

43:56.920 --> 44:01.597
<i>Pula, pula, pula!</i>

44:01.720 --> 44:05.999
<i>Pula, pula, pula!</i>

44:11.160 --> 44:13.152
<i>Pula, pula, pula, pula.</i>

44:28.080 --> 44:30.549
Ma, what are they shouting?

44:31.200 --> 44:32.600
<i>Pula.</i>

44:33.160 --> 44:34.674
It means "rain".

44:35.760 --> 44:37.831
They're celebrating.

44:37.960 --> 44:41.112
<i>Pula, pula, pula!</i>

44:42.000 --> 44:44.276
Accept the vote and conclude the meeting.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.672
Uncle!

44:56.160 --> 44:57.594
Uncle!

44:58.600 --> 44:59.875
Uncle.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.913
The British are not your allies.

45:07.400 --> 45:10.677
I know exactly what I'm doing,
and why I'm doing it.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.200
Do you, Seretse?

45:13.240 --> 45:15.596
Do you think she is your ally?

45:15.720 --> 45:19.600
Your grandfather had no option,
but to allow outsiders to rule us,

45:19.760 --> 45:24.437
but you... you bring this one
to rule our tribe by choice.

45:24.600 --> 45:27.035
What you are doing
is demeaning to your own people.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.958
This has nothing to do with love!

45:30.960 --> 45:36.592
So next time you look in the mirror,
ask yourself this:

45:36.760 --> 45:41.198
Were you not a king,
would she ever even looked at you?

45:43.280 --> 45:46.193
Now she knows there's
no Buckingham Palace in Serowe,

45:46.320 --> 45:49.711
how long before the village dust
gets in her eyes?

45:57.160 --> 46:00.358
Now you will see how an empire
defends itself, Mr Khama.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.318
Where will he go?

46:57.240 --> 46:59.357
He will start a new settlement somewhere.

47:02.360 --> 47:04.352
It's our way to avoid conflict.

47:05.320 --> 47:07.596
We stay apart, but we stay at peace.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.275
'Let me show you the blood lilies.'

47:18.400 --> 47:21.438
- Something to discuss?
- Indeed.

47:21.600 --> 47:23.831
Come. We shall leave the men to it.

47:23.960 --> 47:27.954
My wife is capable of hearing what the
commissioner has to say, Mrs Lancaster.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.114
As you wish.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.150
Though what I have to say
she may not want to hear.

47:36.280 --> 47:37.600
Oh, but I do.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.354
There is going to be a delay

47:41.520 --> 47:44.592
in our acknowledgment
of your position as tribal chief.

47:45.880 --> 47:48.679
Your uncle is questioning your legitimacy.

47:48.800 --> 47:51.838
There is nothing to be questioned
in the decision of the kgotla.

47:51.960 --> 47:55.840
The approval of the kgotla
was for your position as chief,

47:55.960 --> 47:57.553
not the suitability of your wife.

47:57.680 --> 48:01.230
I made it quite clear that a vote
for me was also a vote for my wife.

48:01.360 --> 48:03.352
They knew what they were voting for.

48:03.520 --> 48:05.000
Did they?

48:06.040 --> 48:09.716
Mr Khama, Sir Alistair Canning
wants to be fair about this.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.915
It should reassure you to know
that he has appointed

48:13.080 --> 48:16.676
the Chief Justice of the High Commission
Territory, Sir Walter Harragin,

48:16.800 --> 48:18.359
to conduct an enquiry.

48:18.560 --> 48:21.234
Into what? My wife?

48:21.360 --> 48:24.592
An enquiry that will prove that
our marriage has riled South Africa?

48:24.760 --> 48:26.592
South Africa is not the issue.

48:26.720 --> 48:30.350
Sir Alistair looked me square in the eye
in London and said that it was.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.872
Well, then you clearly misunderstood.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.798
Seretse, do I look like a fool to you?

48:34.920 --> 48:36.274
Not in the slightest.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.435
Commissioner,
to keep up this false pretence

48:40.600 --> 48:44.116
that this is not about Great Britain's
fears of South Africa's discontent

48:44.240 --> 48:47.199
and what that might mean for you
and your government...

48:48.720 --> 48:50.120
...is very distasteful.

48:50.240 --> 48:55.360
Mr Khama, neither you or I are privy
to discussions of the British Cabinet.

48:57.440 --> 48:59.397
But one thing you can be sure of

48:59.560 --> 49:02.280
are the conversations
that I am having with your uncle.

49:03.800 --> 49:05.996
And it is he who demanded this enquiry.

49:14.880 --> 49:18.351
Hey. Ooh.

49:21.560 --> 49:24.758
Did I ever tell you I didn't
just marry you for your good looks?

49:26.920 --> 49:28.320
Liar.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.760
Malaria.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.791
Six cattle died here ten days ago.

51:03.800 --> 51:06.872
Then three white men came,
and started drilling with a machine.

51:08.160 --> 51:12.439
We thought they had come here to
help us find water, but they ignored us.

52:12.600 --> 52:15.798
I need help with some shopping.
Can you come?

52:20.000 --> 52:21.400
It's okay.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.551
Let's get you the things you need.

52:52.560 --> 52:54.074
Um...

53:00.000 --> 53:01.400
Cornflour.

53:05.240 --> 53:06.833
Cornflour, <i>mma.</i>

53:25.920 --> 53:27.320
I missed you.

53:40.960 --> 53:44.590
Kwashiorkor, malnutrition, malaria.

53:47.680 --> 53:50.195
The hospitals can't cope with the demands.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.599
So what can we do?

53:53.720 --> 53:57.839
We depend on the reports the district
commissioner sends to London.

53:57.960 --> 54:02.000
And they do nothing.
There's no money left after the war.

54:02.720 --> 54:05.394
They never gave us money before the war.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.995
We pay the taxes they demand,
and we get nothing.

54:23.600 --> 54:24.920
Mr Nash.

54:26.880 --> 54:29.076
What is keeping you here so long?

54:30.400 --> 54:32.596
It's a beautiful country.

54:33.680 --> 54:36.752
I should be flattered,
but I don't believe you.

54:39.760 --> 54:43.151
- The story?
- Oh, is that what I am? A story?

54:45.560 --> 54:47.279
It's okay. I'm not offended.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.153
I thought I'd catch the film.

54:50.520 --> 54:51.920
Only whites allowed I hear.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.072
And kings.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.795
- Even black ones.
- Why do you come?

54:58.080 --> 54:59.400
To something like this?

55:00.160 --> 55:03.358
There's not a black face in sight
outside of the waiters and maids.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.360
Defiance.

55:09.880 --> 55:13.191
The knowledge that one day
things will change because they have to.

55:14.240 --> 55:15.674
And it has to start somewhere.

55:17.600 --> 55:20.399
Mrs Khama... how nice to see you again.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.354
You too.

55:23.960 --> 55:25.314
Thank you, my love.

55:28.560 --> 55:31.155
I read something of yours
in "World Reporter".

55:31.280 --> 55:32.714
An old copy.

55:32.880 --> 55:36.590
About the Chinese civil war.
Was impressive.

55:36.760 --> 55:40.436
Hmm, it's true,
I'm just a burnt-out war correspondent

55:40.600 --> 55:42.319
trying to find another story.

55:42.880 --> 55:44.872
Well, there's one, right there.

55:45.880 --> 55:47.917
Drilling in the Naledi Valley.

55:48.800 --> 55:50.120
Mineral testing.

55:51.040 --> 55:54.272
What? Copper? Diamonds?

55:55.240 --> 55:56.754
I don't know,

55:56.920 --> 56:00.914
but I imagine it wouldn't be difficult
for someone like you to find out.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.956
The valley stretches across
into South Africa.

56:04.160 --> 56:07.597
It's been lucrative that side.
Now they've started exploring our side.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.200
Without our permission.

56:11.120 --> 56:12.839
But with the British Government's?

56:12.960 --> 56:14.314
Presumably.

56:16.720 --> 56:21.033
You know what a discovery
would mean to this country, to my people.

56:22.320 --> 56:24.277
It would change everything.

56:24.400 --> 56:26.232
But only if our interests are secured.

56:28.520 --> 56:30.591
I can do that if I'm ahead of the game.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.869
And if I have enough information.

56:37.680 --> 56:39.194
Enjoy the film.

56:59.440 --> 57:01.591
I have some rather good news for you.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.160
A word after the film.

57:06.800 --> 57:09.918
Mr Khama, don't you want
to hear the good news?

57:10.040 --> 57:11.759
We have tickets for you.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.034
Tickets?

57:14.720 --> 57:16.120
For what?

57:16.240 --> 57:20.678
The government want to rectify the matter
of your chieftainship face to face.

57:21.320 --> 57:22.595
In London.

57:24.600 --> 57:27.798
Dealing with such matters long distance,
it slows the process down,

57:27.920 --> 57:30.594
which isn't good for you, and your people.

57:32.920 --> 57:34.752
So we thought a month would suffice.

57:35.960 --> 57:37.280
Oh.

57:37.400 --> 57:39.551
It would give you, Mrs Khama,
an opportunity

57:39.680 --> 57:41.592
to see your friends, see your family.

57:50.600 --> 57:51.954
You shouldn't come.

57:53.120 --> 57:55.715
They want me here and you in London.

57:55.840 --> 57:57.991
That is why you must be here,
and me in London.

57:59.320 --> 58:02.552
I have to go back to resolve this.
We don't have a choice in that.

58:02.680 --> 58:05.593
But if you come with me,
they won't allow you back.

58:06.600 --> 58:09.832
Why else would they purchase you
a trip to visit your family?

58:09.960 --> 58:13.715
You can't just go.
Why would I be here by myself?

58:14.560 --> 58:18.349
Seretse, I gave up everything
to be with you, but I can't do this alone.

58:19.720 --> 58:23.157
I promise as long as I live
you will never be alone.

58:24.520 --> 58:26.239
But if you leave with me...

58:27.240 --> 58:30.995
...then I can never return because
they will force you to stay in England,

58:31.160 --> 58:32.719
and I will not return without you.

59:10.840 --> 59:12.194
What the devil is this?

59:13.600 --> 59:16.593
My people have decided
that my wife should stay.

59:17.720 --> 59:21.430
Tell your people to remove themselves
from this gate immediately.

59:21.600 --> 59:24.434
Unfortunately, in the absence
of your decision

59:24.600 --> 59:26.319
on my appointment as the king,

59:26.440 --> 59:28.750
I don't have any power over them.

59:37.520 --> 59:42.231
Mrs Khama, I strongly urge you
to reconsider and come with us.

59:43.200 --> 59:44.873
My husband has told you. He's...

59:46.200 --> 59:49.238
It's not within his power
to order these people to do anything,

59:49.360 --> 59:50.714
and as a woman...

59:52.440 --> 59:55.239
...well, I have no say
in the matter whatsoever.

59:55.400 --> 59:58.711
So, alas, I'm powerless to help you.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.274
- That was very good.
- Thank you.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.880
I'm ready, Commissioner.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.552
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.600
Enter.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.431
Ah, Mr Khama. Good afternoon.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.877
I'm grateful to you for returning
to London. Do please take a seat.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.439
I'm intrigued to know
why you've brought me all this way.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.239
The government summoned me here last week

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.431
upon receipt of the Harragin report.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.514
They have reviewed it and considered
the conflict between you and your uncle.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.837
And after taking all things into account,

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.758
we have concluded

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.958
that you should be exiled
from Bechuanaland

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.753
for a period of five years.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.551
Call it a period of reflection.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.276
After five years, we will, of course,
review the situation.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.716
But in the meantime,

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.959
we are able to offer you a position
in the administration of Jamaica.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.392
And we will, of course, make sure
we accommodate your dear wife.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.237
Jamaica is not my country.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.272
There are some similarities.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.593
I belong with my people.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.399
We will be imposing direct rule,

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.600
with the district commissioner, Rufus
Lancaster, acting as native authority.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.315
There will, of course,
be a tribal council,

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.550
so your people will have some sort of say

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.232
in our running of your affairs.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.556
I do understand
this is an awful lot to digest.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.319
I want to see the Harragin report.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.193
Not possible.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.671
It was an advisory paper, so
the government's not obliged to publish,

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.076
but I can tell you this:

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.396
The conclusion was

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.430
you are not
a fit and proper person to rule.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.193
Upon what basis?

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.152
That's confidential to the government.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.431
I have a right to know.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.717
Sir Walter has weighed the evidence.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.394
And you chose to agree.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.680
Mr Khama, I am the British Government's
representative in your country...

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.871
And yet you know nothing of it.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.279
You don't even live there.
You are based somewhere else entirely.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.598
Content with your government
to run our affairs from South Africa,

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.952
you move as closely with
Prime Minister Malan and his government,

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.436
as you do the British prime minster.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.117
And, yes, Sir Alistair,
I am questioning your motives.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.438
I do not make the decisions.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.320
You advise.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.592
And my advice... is always confidential.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:32.356
It's six o'clock, Sir Alistair.
Might I suggest a glass of sherry?

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.514
Splendid idea.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.796
The government
will release this white paper.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.435
It explains the situation
and your succession.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.831
It sets out in fairly plain English

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.034
that were it not for our intervention,
Bechuanaland would have been torn apart

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.396
by the rivalry between you and your uncle.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.040
That is an utter fabrication!

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.432
We are merely documenting
what your uncle has told us.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.999
Oh, gosh. Thanks very much.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.114
Sherry, Mr Khama?

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.674
Hello, Ruth.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.554
You're in hospital in Serowe.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.720
You have diphtheria,
but it is being treated.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.000
And, Ms Khama, the doctor here
has discovered you are with child.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.438
- But...
- My husband and I are concerned

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.434
that you should now get
the very best treatment available.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.116
So he is organising for you to go to
Cape Town and visit a gynaecologist.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.959
Dr Wessels.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.318
Oh, Ruth, you are awake.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.560
This chap I'm talking about
is the top man in Africa.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.799
It wouldn't be right
not to put my faith in the doctors here.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.552
Without wanting to alarm you,

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.879
death rates in childbirth,
for both mother and baby, in Serowe

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.878
are dangerously high.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.753
To stay here would be a serious risk.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.713
We do urge you to go to Cape Town.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.111
Well, perhaps Dr Wessels could come here.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.880
Dr Wessels does not travel
to his patients.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.600
Look, I know what you're doing.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.951
- And I don't like it.
- Mrs Khama...

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.550
I will ask you now both,
will you please leave?

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.275
Whatever your opinion of my husband,

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.399
I am here only as a woman,
who is also a mother.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.718
I'm thinking only of the survival
of yourself and that of your baby.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.116
You must give yourself
the very best chance.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.755
We know Africa, and you do not.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.754
I appreciate your thoughtfulness,
but I want to decide.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.111
- Mrs Khama, Ruth...
- That's enough!

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.878
Please... do as my sister asks.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.429
How dare you, girl.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.751
Who on earth do you think
you're addressing?

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:05.917
And who do you think <i>you're</i> addressing?

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.511
I am Naledi Khama,
from the royal family of the Bangwato.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.352
Granddaughter of Khama the Great,

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:16.560
and sister to the present king,
who will never be dethroned.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.795
Hello?

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.080
- My love?
- 'It's Ruth. Can you hear me?'

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.554
My love, I can hear you.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.912
Best news in the world, I am pregnant.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.799
- 'We are having a baby.'
- A baby.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.596
'I've been to the hospital and
Dr Moikangao says everything's good.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.154
'How about that?'

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.277
It's wo... it's wonderful news.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.758
'I cannot wait for you to come home.'

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.680
When are you coming back?

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.234
Ruth, something's...
something has happened.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:21.511
Uh... I-I had my meeting with Canning.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.754
I have been banished.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.553
'The Harragin report stated
that I am not fit to rule.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.520
I-I cannot come back for five years.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.520
This can't be happening.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.118
They are determined that we will
not be together in Bechuanaland.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.714
And if I return, they'll have
no reason to allow you back.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.237
'We were never supposed to be apart!
You promised me!

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:53.955
'You promised me
that everything would be all right!'

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.679
I know.

01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:59.000
I know. I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.996
Then find your way back to me, Seretse.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.992
'Find your way back.'

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.399
- 'I promise you I will.'
- Seretse...

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.314
Ruth... Ruth? Ruth! Ruth...

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.840
Seretse?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.390
Ruth! Ruth!

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.712
'In a countermove
to pressure the British Government,

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.232
'Seretse Khama, exiled Bechuanaland
chief, today appealed to the British public.

01:09:36.359 --> 01:09:38.033
'In a fighting address,

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.710
'the chief told the people of Britain
to hold its government to account.'

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.591
I do not believe the British public
will tolerate such injustice to me,

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.599
and, more importantly,
to my suffering people

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.599
who have always remained loyal
to the British crown.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:59.398
I ask my people now
to remain dignified and law-abiding,

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.160
whilst I seek justice for our nation,

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.717
and to be returned... to my country...

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.200
...and my wife.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.393
Mr Khama... Anthony Benn.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.874
You got my letter.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.880
Seretse, uh, Mr Benn is a friend of Joe's.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.360
We want to help.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.591
Fenner Brockway. May we?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.719
Uh, yes. Please.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.598
It's subterfuge. Propaganda.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.877
It's completely unprincipled.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.879
We are talking about an entire nation
who want their leader.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.550
While your government are concealing
their reasons for keeping me here,

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.991
they are allowing our lands
to be explored for minerals.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.597
- For diamonds.
- And you believe the two are connected.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.958
I don't know, but what happens
if they make a find?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.311
Mr Khama, you are a protectorate,

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.194
which differentiates you somewhat
from other colonies.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.791
Meaning the mineral rights should be
vested with the people of my country.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:11.392
Ordinarily, yes, but you have been
placed under direct rule.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.836
Your situation may have become vulnerable.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.920
My grandfather negotiated those rights.
I know they remain with us.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.350
You are vulnerable.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.160
What if the government acknowledged
our rights publicly in some way?

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.680
Or if I could get them on record

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.076
recognising the agreement
they have with us?

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.438
Well, that would be a great help,
and a miracle.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:39.156
I will look into the legalities
of your country's change in status.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.920
And the Harragin report?

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.952
We'll get a copy.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.554
You have my word.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.760
Seretse, please hold your people off.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.799
If the election brings new blood,
it could change everything.

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.517
How long can we rely on the good nature
of our people to stand by peacefully?

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.840
Tomorrow, Sir Alistair Canning
will announce to my people

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.271
the appointment of one of his
administration as the new native authority

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.754
to govern my people.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.996
Every district was alerted, sir.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.990
We were expecting 10,000 at this meeting.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.031
The tribe is refusing
to organise a council.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.918
Until their king... is returned.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.792
When a man tells a lie,

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.512
he loses his dignity.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.598
And so it is with a country.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.910
I'm calling
on the British Government today

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.720
to release the Harragin report.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.513
What are they hiding?

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.559
'...they did so
with only the slightest of...

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.431
'In a bid to show his support
for the exiled chief of Bechuanaland...'

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.791
'The leader of the opposition,
Mr Churchill, addressed Parliament.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.075
'Mr Churchill told the House
of his deeply held belief

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.318
'in the virtue of the Christian marriage,
which he described

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:16.229
'as a "scared bond
between a husband and his wife".

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.832
'Why are the Labour government keeping
this African chief and his woman apart?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.391
'Putting his opposition
to Khama's banishment on the record,

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.598
'Mr Churchill went on to announce
to the House his full intention

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.360
'of returning to the chief
and his wife their kingdom,

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.957
'when his Conservative Party
wins the forthcoming general election.'

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.670
The honourable gentleman
for Eton and Slough.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.117
We know these actions against Mr Khama

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:50.235
are effectively introducing the principle
of a colour bar to British politics,

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.591
separating black from white.

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.234
It is an utter betrayal,

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.398
both of myself, as your prime minister,
and of your government.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.353
The betrayal is of the British people,

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:06.230
and anyone who believed the Labour Party
is on the side of what is right and just.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.953
The world is watching.

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:11.511
The UN have a petition signed by
every prominent black leader in the US.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.395
America is sending funds to Mr Khama,

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:19.155
so that he can defend himself against us.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.754
It's... I mean, look at these.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.396
Never has a Labour government been
criticised this way by the negro press.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.593
We are on the eve of the election.
I am pleading with you.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.911
Send him home before Churchill does.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.999
It will be an almighty humiliation
if a Tory government

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.435
fulfils our responsibility!

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:38.435
I would like nothing more than to say to
hell with Malan and his damned apartheid,

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.435
but we need South Africa to protect us
from Stalin and his advance there.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.592
We all do! Including the...

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.991
...hypocritical Americans with
their Jim Crow laws lauding this over us!

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:53.757
- They're pointing out the facts.
- These are the facts! There's a Cold War.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.032
If I allow that chief,
or any black chief and his white queen,

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.793
to sleep in the same bed on African soil,

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.429
Malan will withdraw from the Commonwealth.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.876
He will utilise any favour
we show that couple

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.720
to whip up nationalist support
for a separate republic.

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:10.151
- He'll withdraw his uranium...
- This is how we justify our actions?

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.317
- An atomic bomb programme?
- And his gold!

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.319
If you don't care about the uranium,
think about our economy.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.432
How long can we sustain our currency

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.432
without Malan supplying our gold reserves?

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.434
Hmm? You count the months!

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.596
We have done a deal with the devil.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.830
'Twenty-four hours have passed
since the polling stations closed,

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.191
'and the last vote was cast.

saw the Conservatives

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.760
'triumphed by a tiny majority.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.270
'Nevertheless, the majority it was.'

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:32.600
Mr Khama. Good morning.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.160
Morning.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:38.032
Sir Winston Churchill will be
making his announcement

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.750
about your return to Bechuanaland
in the House of Commons this afternoon.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.872
He wished for me
to convey it to you first.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.393
I appreciate that.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.756
He's decided that five years' banishment

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.078
will cause unrest and uncertainty
in the protectorate,

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.999
and he wishes to bring an end
to such insecurity.

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.596
Consequently, he will be announcing
that your banishment...

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.354
...is for life.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:11.955
I beg your pardon?

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.390
Yes, on the occasion of our previous
meeting I was able to offer you a career

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.517
in the administration of Jamaica.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.197
Pity you did not accept. Under current
circumstances, I cannot repeat the offer.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.755
Nor, indeed, a posting to any other land.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:34.758
The prime minister
announced his intentions.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:40.957
He clearly stated that
he would allow me back home.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.596
Opposition is one thing, Mr Khama.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.356
The realities of government
are quite another. Good day.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.839
I want him to come back to me.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:22.392
Churchill promised. He promised.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.559
I believed him.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.074
Seretse says he'll write to Tshekedi,
and try and reconcile, but...

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.398
You have to be strong.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.511
You have a voice. Use it.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:45.311
Mr Churchill,
10,000 of my husband's people

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.275
fought the war for you,
and for the freedom of Britain.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.757
They answered your call
in your darkest hour.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.920
'Mr Churchill,
you have betrayed my husband,

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.073
'and each and every one
of those 10,000 men.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.831
'You have caused great hurt.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.920
'You have caused great anger
amongst a peaceful people.

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:08.113
'And Mr Churchill...

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.272
'...I'm with them.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.800
'And I will remain with them

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.991
'because this is my home.'

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.996
'A great event at Silverstone...'

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.432
'Uncle,

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:48.116
'our country is now completely
under the control of the British.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:53.594
'You taught me that the colonialist
strategy is to divide and rule,

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.276
'and that the only response
is to stand united.

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:02.036
'My exile leaves our country
divided and vulnerable.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.516
'Even as I write the British have
authorised test drilling on our lands.

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:13.560
'You know what it will mean to our country
if diamonds or other minerals are found.

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.232
'We must protect that wealth
for our people.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.595
'I need to come home to fulfil the role
for which you raised me.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.600
'To lead. To serve.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.310
'But I cannot do it without you.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:34.831
'If I can find a way to come back,

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:37.077
'will you agree to hear my plan?'

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.318
Mr Khama will never return
to Bechuanaland.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.789
The decision of my government
is absolute and final.

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.834
Control them, or I'll close the kgotla.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.680
Sir, you have pushed
the patience of the people too far.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.752
You can't close our kgotla

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.317
any more than I can close
your Houses of Parliament.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.720
Hey!

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.760
Hey!

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.113
Shh, shh.

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.714
Hello?

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:13.197
Here is your daughter.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.120
Can you hear her?

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.713
No.

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.039
'Hang on. Can you hear her?'

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.038
I-I can. I can hear her.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.678
But... she sounds... Is she all right?

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.119
'She's beautiful.'

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.594
But she's crying.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.996
Oh, I jabbed her, so she'd make a noise.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.239
Isn't she beautiful?

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.553
She's, she's beautiful.

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:49.234
I wish you could see her.

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.033
You must come to me.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.039
'Are we giving up?'

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.872
No. No, we are not.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.677
'But we've been separated for too long.'

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.757
I can't do this alone any more.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.872
And I need you.

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.591
'I need my family.'

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.719
'As soon as the baby's strong enough,
we'll come to you.'

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.557
My tickets have arrived.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.558
Would it be all right if I joined you?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.878
See, I don't know when I'll be back.

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.274
It's okay. Mmm.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.120
There.

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.360
Why are they here?

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.595
They are thanking you
for walking the road with them.

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.793
This song is about you.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.318
They are saying Seretse's wife
is as bright as the morning star.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.753
This way, Mr Khama.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:48.000
Oh... this is Daddy.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.313
There's someone else here to see you.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.198
Thank you for coming.

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.598
- Hello, Daddy.
- Ruth.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.960
This is Jacqueline.

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:53.156
# Sometimes I'm happy

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:58.230
# Sometimes I'm blue

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:02.832
â™ª My disposition... â™ª

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.237
- Mr Nash...
- Thank you for coming.

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:18.191
The story on the mining companies.
I thought you'd like to know.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.234
We need a bit more information,

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.920
but I'll say we'll be running with this
in about a week.

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:40.875
What?

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:45.995
Nash... he's doing a story.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.320
It's not confirmed, it's too soon, but...

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.200
...there has been a find.

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.629
Diamonds?

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.198
Yes.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.431
Just three diamonds, but...

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.953
But yes.

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.753
It's a beginning.

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.114
It could mean everything.

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:09.516
The British don't know about the find yet.

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.597
If I can get ahead...

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.593
...I know, I know I can get this right.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.909
The prime minister told this country

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.800
that he would allow
the King of Bangwato to return home.

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.595
After the election,
he banished him for life.

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.234
For good.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:34.517
Having deprived
the Bangwato people of their king,

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.236
can his Commonwealth
under-secretary, at the very least,

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:42.434
assure us that the Bangwato people
will still have a say

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.876
in the running of their own affairs?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:50.598
With particular reference to the use
of their land for mineral exploitation?

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:54.356
Let me make it clear that the dispute

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:57.280
is not between us and the Bangwato,

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.596
it is between the chief and his uncle.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:03.350
We have a responsibility
to keep this warring family apart.

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:07.350
With respect
to the Right Honourable Gentleman,

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:11.070
his answer had nothing to do
with the question I just asked.

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:14.756
Mr Chairman, the Honourable Gentleman
seems to be hounding me for an answer

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:18.351
- that I'm quite prepared to give.
- Yes? Go on.

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.759
Let me make an assurance

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.918
that no leases will be given
to any mining companies,

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:30.631
without the consent
of the Bangwato themselves.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.878
The report.

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:45.754
How did you get it?

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:50.834
Let's say not everyone is proud of what
their government does on their behalf.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:57.959
Harragin concludes
that you are a fit and proper person

01:33:58.160 --> 01:33:59.992
to succeed to the kingdom.

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.434
And that you, Ruth,

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.831
are acceptable to the Bangwato people.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.636
But that neither of you
are acceptable to South Africa.

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.360
It's your proof.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.270
Because my exile is now permanent,

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.838
I need to put our family affairs in order.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.151
As a consequence, I would like

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:37.034
to arrange a meeting with my uncle

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.277
in Bechuanaland,

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.110
and so I'm requesting permission
to travel.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.634
Well, Mr Khama,
I have looked at your request.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.440
And as a gesture of goodwill,

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:59.196
and to ensure that all can see
the sincerity of our efforts

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:03.872
to keep peace within your tribe...
I will allow it.

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:09.557
But only for a period of one week.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.993
By which point we expect you
to have dealt with whatever...

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:19.430
...family concerns
you may need to address.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.960
Thank you.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:30.436
How kind of you, Mr Roberts.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.876
I hope you know how appreciative we are.

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.991
We have a very difficult negotiation.

01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.993
Yes, Uncle.

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.151
This is Jacqueline.

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.160
She is a sweet one.

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:31.833
I was going to put her down, but I...

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.720
I think she'd rather be
in another mother's arms.

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:48.638
Yes, she's a sweet one.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:54.714
I have read your letter.

01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.636
And what are your thoughts, Uncle?

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:12.236
If we can agree now
to let go of our claims to the kingship,

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.829
we will be equal private citizens.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.994
Then my marriage can be of no concern
to South Africa, Great Britain or anyone.

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:23.437
Any disagreement between you and me
becomes a domestic squabble,

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.273
not an affair of state.

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.198
Then I will be allowed to return home.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.719
And we can start to rebuild.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.196
You're speaking of dismantling hundreds
and hundreds of years of tradition.

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.871
Uncle... you should read this.

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.637
You, me, our people...

01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:58.230
...we have been pawns
in somebody else's game.

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.360
They are coming.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.156
You may have convinced me, Seretse...

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.920
...but now you're going
to have to convince the people.

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.795
I believe that two days ago, Mr Khama,

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.593
you had a meeting with your uncle,

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.992
authorised by Mr Roberts
in the Commonwealth Office.

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.915
Mr Roberts will not be available
in the future to make such decisions.

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:53.318
I also know you want to discuss
the outcome of that meeting with me

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.909
for relay to the British Government.

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:59.713
Before you begin, let me be clear.

01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:04.438
There can and will be no circumstance

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.991
in which we will allow you
to return to Bechuanaland permanently.

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.597
No... circumstance?

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:20.160
Not even a hand-delivered copy
of the Harragin report to the press?

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:25.949
"Government lies to British public
for fear of South Africa in Khama affair."

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.959
There would be conditions.

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.754
I would have to discuss them
with the government.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:42.036
You should know this, Mr Khama...

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:47.320
I would personally demand that you
give up all claim to the chieftainship,

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.591
and that your uncle do the same.

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.320
Sir Alistair,

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.276
I don't have to do anything anymore.

01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.349
But... I will agree to that.

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:06.231
And... upon condition that
we continue direct rule from London.

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.034
I will agree to this, also.

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.990
Up to the point
where we will hold democratic elections,

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:17.157
and declare our independence.

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:23.596
Yes, well, an election process
is hardly on the agenda.

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.598
I suspect your government

01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:32.754
may take a slightly more
respectful position moving forward.

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:38.632
You will be aware of the recent
discovery of diamonds on our lands?

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.514
Yes, well...

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.514
Any resources Bechuanaland may have are...

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.390
...hardly relevant
to this issue, Mr Khama.

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:57.196
I hope you caught the news that
your Commonwealth under-secretary

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:00.760
confirmed to Parliament that my people

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:04.794
control all mineral resources
in Bechuanaland.

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.755
You need my husband, Sir Alistair.

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.875
May I offer you a sherry?

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.032
My uncle and I

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.634
are now at peace.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.831
The exile is over!

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.636
I have a new vision for our nation.

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.911
We are a people of tradition,
and rightly so.

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.955
But we need a change in Africa.

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.389
We need a change in Bechuanaland,
whether we like it or not.

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.600
Whether the colonial powers that be
like it or not.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:57.318
It is time for us to take a step
beyond royal succession,

01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:59.830
and into a democratic Bechuanaland.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:04.118
To create a new nation,

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:07.870
not to be ruled by royalty here,
or royalty in great Britain,

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:13.954
but a country to be led
by those who you choose.

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.398
No man is free...

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:23.998
...who is not master of himself.

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.632
Brother and sisters,
it is time for democracy,

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:43.879
for independence,

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:47.598
for us to be the masters of our own fate.

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.999
A new Bechuanaland.

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:52.038
A new Africa.

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.754
It is time!

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:04.591
<i>Pula, pula, pula, pula...</i>

01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:06.080
Ruth!
