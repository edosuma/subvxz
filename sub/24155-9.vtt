and, of course,
your caption!

09:56.129 --> 09:59.331
Wow!
It looks amazing in print.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.399
Guys,
I'm gonna be honest,

10:01.435 --> 10:04.235
just speaking
as an average Josephine,

10:04.271 --> 10:06.004
I really don't get
that caption.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.907
Maybe it doesn't matter
if my caption is funny or not.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.942
I think I just wanted
to be part of Ble.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.778
It's something I've been
a fan of for so long.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.413
And maybe we can
bring it back.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.282
There's no reason
it can't have a new dawn.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.883

10:18.919 --> 10:21.286
Okay, boys,
close her down!

No, you're right.
Can't be nostalgic!

10:30.864 --> 10:33.999
Man, that caption was amazing
in my head.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.835
Maybe I'm not
a very funny person.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.370
Like, I got low comedy stats.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.938
That's kind of a bummer.

Yo, BMO.
Check it out!

10:44.344 --> 10:46.011
I got Ble
to publish my caption,

10:46.046 --> 10:48.446
even though I don't need you
to think I'm funny anymo--

10:48.482 --> 10:50.215
