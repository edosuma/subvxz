Torchwood.

00:03.866 --> 00:06.329
outside the Government, beyond the police.

00:06.329 --> 00:09.377
Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race.

00:09.377 --> 00:13.770
The 21st century is when everything changes,

00:13.770 --> 00:15.743

00:43.191 --> 00:45.008
Mike

00:45.554 --> 00:47.100
did you hear that?

00:48.424 --> 00:50.111
Someone's in the living room!

00:52.310 --> 00:55.193
-Are you gonna go in there?
-Are you?

01:07.602 --> 01:10.051
-Emergency, which service? 
-Police.

01:10.051 --> 01:13.540
My name's Beth Halloran, 
I'm at 114 Brodsky Gardens.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.985
I think there's a burglar in the flat,
come quickly.

01:15.985 --> 01:18.362
-Come on!
-Mike! Mike!

01:18.362 --> 01:20.692
Sit down!-

01:20.692 --> 01:23.419
of them! My husband's been injured, send an ambulance!

01:23.419 --> 01:24.865
Get the TV stuff unhooked.

01:24.865 --> 01:27.385
-just take whatever you want!
-Keep her quiet.

01:27.385 --> 01:29.456
Wait, wait. Did you hear that?

01:29.991 --> 01:34.303
Emergency ****

01:35.009 --> 01:37.051
-What's happening?
-Get away from me!

01:37.051 --> 01:39.457
-What is that thing? 
-Please, don't...

01:39.457 --> 01:41.167
Don't... Please...Stop, Stop!

01:41.167 --> 01:42.611
-I'm sorry!
-What's going on?!

01:42.611 --> 01:43.815
I'm sorry!

01:43.815 --> 01:45.678
No-0-0-o!

01:45.678 --> 01:50.080
Get away! No-0-0-o!

02:00.107 --> 02:01.382
Tosh, what happened?

02:01.382 --> 02:04.238
Two IC one males, one fatality, one seriously wounded

02:04.238 --> 02:08.247
after a fall from a fifth-floor window onto a police vehicle.

02:15.556 --> 02:18.651
Bloody hell! Here you are, 
has he been stabilised?

02:18.651 --> 02:22.294
Gwen, Owen, go with him to the hospital, 
see if he says anything.

02:22.294 --> 02:25.469
Interview the husband and wife while you're there. Tosh, with me.

02:30.110 --> 02:32.780
Bit weird, this one. Might be one of yours.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.523
Nobody saw anything, heard anything, blah, blah, blah.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.983
Dunno why we bother asking anymore.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.612
Thanks, we'll take it from here. 
If you could just wait outside.

02:40.612 --> 02:44.977
-In my opinion, the husband 
did it. He was expecting to be burgled.
-Really?

02:44.977 --> 02:49.307
Yeah, look. No other reason I can think of 
for keeping sports equipment in the bedroom.

02:49.307 --> 02:52.330
0h, you should come round to my house for a game of hockey sometime.

02:55.191 --> 02:57.928
-Making friends?
-Not really. What have you got?

02:57.928 --> 03:00.978
No glass inside, 
so it was definitely broken out.

03:00.978 --> 03:06.595
Police say the stab wounds were caused 
by some long, narrow blade. 
Which that isn't.

03:06.595 --> 03:10.385
No other weapons in the room could have done this. So how the hell did they manage it?

03:10.385 --> 03:13.473
Husband was unconscious, 
and the wife probably weighs less than I do.

03:13.473 --> 03:18.370
-I can't see either of them doing this.
-you'd be surprised what you can do.

03:20.254 --> 03:24.412
I didn't see anything. We all heard this weird noise,

03:24.412 --> 03:31.570
then the next thing I know, I'm in the corner and he's just sitting there, dead.

03:31.570 --> 03:33.580
-The other one was just gone. 
-And then what?

03:33.580 --> 03:38.464
Nothing. I just stayed there till the police arrived. I couldn't move.

03:38.464 --> 03:39.852
I should have checked on Mike.

03:39.852 --> 03:44.021
Don't be silly. You did the right thing. I'm fine.

03:44.021 --> 03:47.532
Be quiet, you. The doctor said you should rest.

03:47.532 --> 03:50.225
I don't think the doctor meant my mouth.

03:50.225 --> 03:52.162
Actually, he did, he was very specific.

03:52.162 --> 03:55.042
He said, 'No talking for a whole week.'

03:55.042 --> 03:58.123
Lies, lies! Why so many lies?!

03:58.123 --> 04:02.815
OK, thanks for your time. We'll let you get some rest now.

04:05.050 --> 04:08.585
-Not a trace of blood on their hands, either of them. 
-Then who did it?

04:08.585 --> 04:11.003
-She did, obviously. 
-Why obviously?

04:11.003 --> 04:13.503
Well, look at her.

04:16.796 --> 04:18.682
It's OK.

04:18.682 --> 04:22.254
Yeah, I can see what you're saying, she's absolutely terrified.

04:22.254 --> 04:28.589
It's always the one you least suspect. Hubby's out cold, and she survives while two burglars get mangled?

04:28.589 --> 04:30.743
-She did it, she must have. 
-How?

04:30.743 --> 04:33.446
-I haven't worked that bit out yet.
-Ah, I see, I see.

04:33.446 --> 04:35.681
All right then, jessica Fletcher, 
who dunn it?

04:35.681 --> 04:39.559
The husband. His wife's in danger, 
he has a cricket bat under the bed.

04:39.559 --> 04:42.114
-You fill in the blanks.
-Right, OK.

04:42.114 --> 04:45.807
So, he kills one man, wearing gloves, 
and then he swallows the murder weapon

04:45.807 --> 04:48.112
and the gloves, 
and then he knocks himself out?

04:48.112 --> 04:52.191
-Something like that, yeah.
-To be continued.

04:52.191 --> 04:56.183
-Yeah?/It's me. Anything?
-No, nothing. They're completely clear.

04:56.183 --> 04:58.944
Well, one of them did it, 
we just need to figure out how.

04:58.944 --> 05:03.315
Stay with the burglar
all night if you have to. 
Keep an eye on those two.

05:03.315 --> 05:05.027
-OK, fair enough. 
-Tosh...

05:05.027 --> 05:09.410
That was jack. 
He says that you should stay with the burglar,

05:09.410 --> 05:12.440
and find out if he knows anything, 
all night, if you have to. I know.

05:12.440 --> 05:17.305
-And keep an eye on the other two.
-Brilliant. Brilliant.

05:17.305 --> 05:19.466
Oh, will you get me a coffee before you go?

05:19.466 --> 05:22.481
Yeah, course. What are team mates for?

05:24.300 --> 05:26.700
You haven't got a pound for the machine, have you?

05:28.252 --> 05:31.434
Hospitals. They have to fall apart before anyone fixes them.

05:31.434 --> 05:33.595
-Pound. Coffee. 
-Thank you!

06:07.662 --> 06:11.834
Oh, you're safe, all right? 
You're safe, just tell me who did this to you.

06:11.834 --> 06:15.234
The woman.....in the flat,

06:15.234 --> 06:17.888
keep her away from me!

06:17.888 --> 06:23.331
Page the doctor. 
Can you move, please? 
We need to lie him down. ********

06:26.394 --> 06:29.217
-Tell me everything. 
-Where am I?

06:29.217 --> 06:31.135
-Where's my husband? 
-He's safe.

06:31.135 --> 06:34.135
-What do you mean, safe? 
What have you done with him? 
-Nothing yet.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.196
Tell me what happened in the flat, Beth.

06:39.196 --> 06:42.364
It had to be you or Mike, so how did you do it?

06:42.364 --> 06:44.107
You can't treat people like this.

06:44.107 --> 06:46.512
I've been burgled, attacked!

06:46.512 --> 06:48.741
I want a lawyer, I want a phone call.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.137
-If you're charging me...
-We're not charging you. 
We don't have to.

06:52.137 --> 06:55.987
There'll be no lawyer, no phone calls, 
just us, and this room

06:55.987 --> 06:59.445
for as long as it takes. 
Now, tell me what happened!

06:59.445 --> 07:04.445
I told her... and the police. 
Please, I don't know anything!

07:08.205 --> 07:09.205
Look at them.

07:13.649 --> 07:18.010
The second one just died in hospital. 'Keep her away from me, the woman in the flat.'

07:18.010 --> 07:21.358
Those were his dying words. Why would he say something like that?!

07:21.358 --> 07:23.761
I don't know, I swear. I never touched him.

07:23.761 --> 07:25.782
-Is it Mike? Are you covering for him? 
-No!

07:27.863 --> 07:28.687
Jack?

07:37.785 --> 07:41.414
Beth, we know these men attacked you and your husband.

07:41.414 --> 07:44.066
Now, if you fought back, 
people will understand.

07:44.066 --> 07:46.571
It was self-defence.

07:48.009 --> 07:53.725
I promise...I promise I have no idea what happened to them.

07:53.725 --> 07:56.328
All I know is that it wasn't me.

08:01.984 --> 08:07.059
'just us and this room for as long as it takes?'

08:07.059 --> 08:08.566
Terrifying.

08:09.605 --> 08:12.548
-Really? 
-Absolutely. 
Shivers down my spine.

08:12.548 --> 08:16.635
-You don't look scared.
-Oh, it...passed.

08:17.974 --> 08:22.660
-Tosh, anything on the body scan?
-Nothing out of the ordinary.

08:22.660 --> 08:25.454
-What about the light? Power surge?
-Nothing from us.

08:25.454 --> 08:29.519
There was an electro-magnetic build-up around her, but how did she cause it?

08:29.519 --> 08:33.024
Same thing happened at the hospital. Can't be a coincidence.

08:33.024 --> 08:34.552
It's her, I know it is.

08:35.837 --> 08:40.368
-OK, let's do some tests, 
see who or what we're dealing with. 
-I'm on it.

08:44.665 --> 08:45.974
What kind of tests?

08:45.974 --> 08:48.748
just little things to clear this all up. 
Blood samples...

08:48.748 --> 08:51.957
Blood samples? 
I haven't done anything!

08:51.957 --> 08:53.684
Look. ..

08:53.684 --> 08:56.505
I believe you, but this is our job.

08:56.505 --> 09:00.914
Something strange happened at your flat. We've gotta make sure you had nothing to do with it.

09:00.914 --> 09:03.726
-I didn't.
-Then you've nothing to worry about.

09:03.726 --> 09:06.426
They're doing these tests whether you like it or not.

09:06.426 --> 09:10.844
Don't make this any harder on yourself. Come on.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.252
This is where you work?

09:25.354 --> 09:27.773
Yep. Cosy, isn't it?

09:29.825 --> 09:31.859
Who are you people?

09:31.859 --> 09:33.214
Don't you have any windows?

09:33.214 --> 09:37.320
It wouldn't really be in keeping with the whole secrecy thing, people looking in.

09:38.034 --> 09:41.345
-We don't sniff the sub-etheric resonator. 
-Sorry.

09:47.030 --> 09:49.023
It's so big.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.851
-This is crazy. 
-Yep.

09:50.969 --> 09:54.318
I suddenly feel very, very small.

09:54.447 --> 09:55.770
Come on.

09:55.770 --> 09:58.767
Let's just get these tests done. Then you can get home, OK?

09:58.767 --> 10:02.477
-Come on, Owen.
-We'll start with a few blood tests, 
nothing to worry about,

10:02.477 --> 10:04.654
just a little...needle.

10:07.363 --> 10:10.243
-What? 
-Needle's snapped.

10:10.243 --> 10:13.478
-Haven't you got a nurse to do this?
-He's a doctor. It's OK.

10:20.161 --> 10:23.193
I'm not gonna do this if you can't even...
What are you doing?

10:23.193 --> 10:25.149
-Bear with me.
-Hey, hey!

10:27.424 --> 10:30.032
When was the last time you were in hospital, Beth?

10:30.032 --> 10:33.699
I don't remember. 
I don't think I ever have. 
Why, what's wrong with me?

10:33.699 --> 10:37.092
-Any operations? Checkups?
-No, nothing.

10:37.092 --> 10:39.841
When was the last time you felt ill? You had a cold?

10:39.841 --> 10:42.293
I don't think I ever have. 
I take a lot of vitamin C.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.630
Mm, hell of a lot I reckon.

10:44.630 --> 10:48.900
OK, Beth. You make light bulbs blow, we can't break your skin.
What planet are you from?

10:49.540 --> 10:51.247
Earth.

10:52.077 --> 10:54.792
Stop wasting our time! 
We know you're an alien!

10:54.792 --> 10:57.117
There's no such thing as aliens.

11:02.671 --> 11:04.728
Beth, janet.

11:04.728 --> 11:06.515
janet, Beth.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.244
-What is it?
-It's an alien. But you know that cos you are, too.

11:13.244 --> 11:15.557
No, it's not.

11:15.557 --> 11:17.252
I'm not. I work in an office...

11:17.252 --> 11:20.501
Why do you give off electro-magnetic waves? Why?!

11:20.501 --> 11:24.075
I don't know! Stop it!

11:24.075 --> 11:26.698
Why are you doing this?! I want Mike.

11:26.698 --> 11:28.150
I want to go home.

11:34.605 --> 11:37.400
Why is it doing that?

11:37.400 --> 11:39.869
I don't know.

11:39.869 --> 11:41.025
It's never done it before.

11:43.858 --> 11:46.452
-This is real, isn't it? 
-Yeah.

11:47.496 --> 11:50.582
I don't know about my skin, 
or any of that other stuff.

11:50.582 --> 11:52.826
I just... How can I prove it to you?

11:52.826 --> 11:56.227
How can I...prove to you...

11:56.227 --> 11:58.127
that I'm not an alien?

12:13.140 --> 12:16.743
-You said we weren't allowed to use that again. 
-It's just a mind probe.

12:16.743 --> 12:19.696
-Remember what happened last time we used it? 
-That was different.

12:19.696 --> 12:22.270
That species has extremely high blood pressure.

12:22.270 --> 12:24.302
0h, right, their heads must explode all the time.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.675
Jack, You can't do this. 
What if you're wrong?

12:27.675 --> 12:30.734
-If she's human, it'll kill her.
-I'm not wrong.

12:30.734 --> 12:33.070
-We have to find out what she is.
-Take it easy, jack.

12:33.070 --> 12:37.257
-Stop at the first sign of trouble.
-Or the first sign of exploding.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.196
Gwen...

12:39.522 --> 12:40.547
bring her up.

12:42.097 --> 12:42.874
OK.

12:44.291 --> 12:45.163
Hey!

12:50.504 --> 12:53.376
-Not too tight, is it? 
-It's fine.

12:54.376 --> 12:56.870
-Are you sure this is safe? 
-Yep.

12:56.870 --> 13:00.193
just try not to, you know, 
kill me, or anything, OK?

13:00.193 --> 13:03.441
You'll probably get dehydrated during the probing.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.078
Thank you.

13:18.101 --> 13:21.803
-We're all set. 
-The probe drills down through 
your consciousness,

13:21.803 --> 13:24.987
so if there's anything hidden, 
it'll pop to the surface.

13:24.987 --> 13:25.809
Will it hurt?

13:26.644 --> 13:27.385
Yeah.

13:29.347 --> 13:30.959
Your bedside manner's rubbish.

13:30.959 --> 13:34.652
You should see his manners in bed, 
they're atrocious. So I've heard.

13:34.652 --> 13:36.032
0h, they are. I remember this...

13:37.674 --> 13:40.806
-All right, we all ready?
-I suppose.

13:40.806 --> 13:45.796
OK, we'll do this slowly. 
Tosh will controlthe probe, 
Owen will make sure you're not in danger,

13:45.796 --> 13:50.514
Ianto will have more water when you need it, 
and I'll be right here, OK?

13:50.514 --> 13:52.432
What about him? 
What does he do?

13:52.579 --> 13:53.745
I'll be watching.

13:54.468 --> 13:55.737
Are you ready, Beth?

13:56.903 --> 13:57.903
All right.

14:02.784 --> 14:03.511
OK, Tosh.

14:13.761 --> 14:14.310
Human.

14:17.739 --> 14:20.600
-Safe. 
-Who killed the burglars, Beth?

14:20.600 --> 14:23.637
I don't know! I... Ah!

14:26.219 --> 14:28.059
-Safe. 
-What planet are you from?

14:30.278 --> 14:32.785
I'm human! 0h, God, it hurts!

14:32.785 --> 14:35.986
-Please, please, stop!
-Go deeper.

14:35.986 --> 14:38.326
-Are you sure? She...
-Do it!

14:44.710 --> 14:47.090
Vital signs are all over the place, 
but still safe.

14:47.090 --> 14:49.300
Getting electro-magnetic build-up again.

14:51.145 --> 14:52.340
Who killed those men?!

14:52.340 --> 14:54.439
I don't know! Make it stop!

14:54.439 --> 14:56.494
-That's it, come on! 
-Go deeper.

15:00.041 --> 15:02.709
-Safe.
-Deeper!

15:18.688 --> 15:20.585
Something's happening to the lights!

15:20.585 --> 15:23.625
-The electro-magnetic pulse is off the scale. 
-She can't take much more!

15:23.625 --> 15:25.305
jack, we've got to stop this!

15:52.634 --> 15:54.611
Oh, my God!

15:55.402 --> 15:58.555
I wouldn't get that close.
Toshiko, what happened?

15:58.555 --> 16:01.608
Hit a buried compartment. Locked away.

16:02.216 --> 16:04.378
She couldn't have been aware of it.

16:07.551 --> 16:14.799
-Who are you? 
-Kayehla janees, putaak graszh, 
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.

16:14.799 --> 16:21.149
-Where are you from? 
-Kayehla janees, putaak graszh, 
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.

16:23.610 --> 16:24.846
How do you like my boots?

16:27.832 --> 16:32.939
Kayehla janees, putaak graszh, 
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.

16:37.783 --> 16:39.711
jack, what is it, what is she saying?

16:39.711 --> 16:42.871
Name, rank, serial number, 
and that's all she's gonna say.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.411
How do you know?

16:45.155 --> 16:48.250
Cos I know who she is 
and why she's here.

16:49.161 --> 16:51.838
-Switch off the probe. 
-Off.

17:13.058 --> 17:15.435
0h, you weren't lying, that really hurt!

17:18.928 --> 17:20.845
Did you find anything?

17:29.232 --> 17:32.836
She's a sleeper agent. 
It all clicked when I saw the implant.

17:32.836 --> 17:34.715
A sleeper agent? Who for?

17:34.715 --> 17:37.309
No-one knows very much, 
they don't leave survivors.

17:37.309 --> 17:40.591
Official designation is Cell 114.

17:40.591 --> 17:43.484
They infiltrate planets, 
adapting their bodies, 
gathering intelligence,

17:43.484 --> 17:47.168
sometimes for years, watching, 
until they're ready to take over.

17:47.168 --> 17:49.320
OK, that's...creepy.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.223
If we're lucky, she's the first.

17:52.223 --> 17:55.729
They send an advance guard to gather intel.

17:55.729 --> 17:59.682
Given false memories so they blend in.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.929
She has no idea she's not human.

18:03.929 --> 18:07.413
Her real self must have taken over briefly, 
killed the burglars.

18:07.413 --> 18:10.124
-Self preservation.
-Told you she did it.

18:10.124 --> 18:17.009
Yeah, The point is, by the time they attack, 
they know every single thing about the planet.

18:17.449 --> 18:18.199
Tosh.

18:18.831 --> 18:22.338
The implant gathers information. 
Normal X-rays don't show it.

18:22.338 --> 18:24.873
She's projecting a false image.

18:25.863 --> 18:28.305
It's got all this data stored inside it.

18:32.337 --> 18:38.190
This is a force-field generator. 
it creates an impervious layer above the skin, 
just a nanometre thick.

18:38.190 --> 18:41.297
-That's why you couldn't get the needle inside her. 
-Right, well...

18:41.297 --> 18:44.017
God, look, they even know about us.

18:45.298 --> 18:48.048
They know more about this place than I do. 
Nobody knows more than I do.

18:48.048 --> 18:50.925
What if there's more of them? 
What are we gonna do about this?

18:50.925 --> 18:52.122
For a start...

18:53.608 --> 18:55.206
I think we should tell her.

18:55.383 --> 19:01.478
Kayehla janees, putaak graszh, 
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.

19:01.478 --> 19:05.879
-Where are you from?
-Kayehla janees, putaak graszh...

19:05.879 --> 19:07.243
Can you turn it off, please?

19:14.098 --> 19:16.784
-So I killed those men? 
-Yes.

19:17.083 --> 19:20.022
And I'm a mass-murdering alien?

19:21.553 --> 19:24.874
-Yes. 
-My whole life...

19:24.874 --> 19:27.505
all my memories, they can't be fake.

19:29.608 --> 19:31.427
I know I love Mike...

19:32.643 --> 19:35.299
-and he loves me.
-He does, and you do.

19:37.181 --> 19:42.252
-So what's real?
-You both are, you both fell in love.
That happened.

19:43.436 --> 19:45.506
Do you feel human?

19:47.568 --> 19:50.687
-Yes.
-Yes. Well, then you are.

19:50.687 --> 19:54.132
What makes us human?
Is it our minds or our bodies?

19:57.754 --> 20:02.751
And what happens when the disguise comes off?
I want to have kids one day.

20:02.751 --> 20:06.827
Is feeling human...
enough for that?

20:10.827 --> 20:12.309
Can you fix me? 
Can you make me human?

20:13.191 --> 20:15.426
No.
Eventually, you'll activate.

20:16.644 --> 20:19.983
Your real memories will come back,
and Beth will disappear.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.395
What do you mean, activate?

20:22.395 --> 20:26.943
Once you gather enough information, 
you'll send it back home, 
and start the invasion.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.788
There must be something you can do.

20:30.788 --> 20:33.531
All this technology, everything you do here...

20:33.531 --> 20:36.782
You can't keep me locked up next to that thing!

20:42.487 --> 20:46.041
-Are you gonna kill me?
-No. No, of course we're not.

20:52.625 --> 20:55.456
Have you killed other aliens?

20:55.456 --> 20:58.602
Only when we've had to.
When it was the last resort -

20:58.602 --> 21:00.917
kill or be killed.

21:07.090 --> 21:08.357
I wish this wasn't happening.

21:10.527 --> 21:14.022
I'd never know.
I'd just live a normal life.

21:14.022 --> 21:19.071
-Until the day ofthe attack.
-I won't do anything! 
I'm not that person!

21:21.376 --> 21:23.576
I'm sorry, but you are.

21:44.101 --> 21:46.503
We can't let her go, 
she's too dangerous.

21:46.503 --> 21:51.089
We could freeze her. 
Use the alien cryogenics.

21:51.089 --> 21:54.365
Wake her up if we figure out 
how to stop her memories from coming back.

21:54.365 --> 21:57.439
-Freeze her? For how long?
-As long as it takes.

21:57.439 --> 22:00.366
-At least she'd be alive.
-Her implant would still gather information.

22:00.366 --> 22:04.565
-Can't we deactivate it?
-I can isolate the transceiver 
and fry it in an EM pulse.

22:04.565 --> 22:09.686
Right now It's not sending or receiving anything now. I've checked it five times on every frequency.

22:09.686 --> 22:11.188
Won't that let them know we're onto them?

22:11.513 --> 22:15.597
No. If we freeze her, she'll never activate and they'll never know.

22:16.038 --> 22:17.169
What about her husband?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.184
She'd have to disappear completely.

22:19.749 --> 22:21.419
No goodbyes.

22:26.905 --> 22:30.806
We had a holiday booked.
Nothing special, just a weekend away.

22:30.806 --> 22:32.817
-Am I ever gonna see him again?
-I don't know.

22:38.470 --> 22:40.954
0h, those men...

22:44.898 --> 22:47.068
0h, my God, those poor men!

22:47.068 --> 22:48.741
What's happening?!

22:53.717 --> 22:57.769
The real memory is coming back, 
destroying the fake human persona.

22:57.769 --> 23:00.169
The sooner we do this, 
the better for everyone.

23:00.169 --> 23:02.322
Beth? Beth, come on.

23:07.926 --> 23:11.580
Promise me something, 
if you can't figure out how to keep me human,

23:11.580 --> 23:14.487
don't wake me up.
just turn the machine off.

23:15.505 --> 23:17.502
That's not a promise I can keep.

23:20.103 --> 23:23.574
OK, you then. I bet you can.

23:23.846 --> 23:28.297
-just don't let me hurt anyone.
-You have my word.

23:30.956 --> 23:35.007
It's funny, I've always had this nagging feeling like I didn't fit in.

23:35.007 --> 23:39.554
just. . .so desperate to have a more exciting life.

23:39.554 --> 23:43.957
-I'm going to hit the transceiver with an EM pulse.
-You won't feel anything. It won't harm you.

23:43.957 --> 23:48.827
It'll take out the force-field generator too 
so I'll have to fry them both.

23:48.827 --> 23:52.148
Do it. I don't want to be invincible.

23:52.148 --> 23:55.254
After that I'm gonna sedate you, 
then we'll freeze you.

23:55.254 --> 23:58.360
It'll be just like going to sleep.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.990
Only a bit colder.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.562
-Bye, Gwen. 
-Bye.

24:12.415 --> 24:13.681
Done.

24:32.949 --> 24:35.781
'If you want the whole bloody seat to yourself, be my guest.

24:35.781 --> 24:39.579
'In fact,' I said, 
'why don't we ask the other passengers to get off,

24:39.579 --> 24:43.588
'and you can have the whole carriage to yourself?
Would you like that?'

24:43.588 --> 24:45.739
-You didn't!
-I did. I was really loud, too.

24:45.739 --> 24:49.855
I couldn't help it, I was just really annoyed. So then...

24:49.855 --> 24:54.144
So then, right, she gives me the dirtiest look, right, and she...

24:58.033 --> 24:59.305
David?

25:02.722 --> 25:03.885
What is that?!

25:05.941 --> 25:07.266
What's happened to your arm?

25:11.081 --> 25:12.954
Hey! Where are you going?

25:13.531 --> 25:15.466
David, you're scaring me!

25:16.439 --> 25:20.221
What are you doing? 
What's happening? 
Come back here!

25:22.633 --> 25:23.954
David!

26:03.540 --> 26:04.758
It's done.

26:05.577 --> 26:07.705
I'm sending her down to the vault.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.078
-Can somebody tell me 
what the hell is going on?
-0h, shit!

27:16.127 --> 27:17.508
-What happened?
-Beth's gone.

27:17.508 --> 27:20.684
-I thought she was frozen! 
-She was! Her vitals were at zero.

27:21.098 --> 27:26.075
-Checking systems, command history...
-What did she do? 
Is it a virus, a lockdown?

27:26.826 --> 27:30.940
-No, she just turned off the lights.
-What is it with her and light bulbs?

27:30.940 --> 27:33.535
-She went through the tunnels.
-Time to change the locks again.

27:33.535 --> 27:38.969
She knew everything about this place, 
it was all in her arm. The tunnels, 
layout, security codes.

27:38.969 --> 27:42.003
She could've shut us down, 
blown us up, anything!

27:42.003 --> 27:44.220
-She didn't.
-I swear she was frozen.

27:44.220 --> 27:47.071
-Tosh, you switched off the transceiver?
-Yes.

27:47.071 --> 27:50.210
-Are you sure?
-Well, I was until you asked.

27:50.210 --> 27:53.637
-Unless there was another false image.
-Hang on, hang on.

27:53.637 --> 27:57.168
Everything about her was a lie.
All of her vital signs were a false image.

27:57.168 --> 28:00.791
She can fool the equipment, 
tell it what we're expecting to see,

28:00.791 --> 28:05.575
so she gets scared and it projects an increased heart rate, we try and freeze it and it does the opposite.

28:05.575 --> 28:09.244
Simulating that much information would need a huge amount of energy.

28:09.244 --> 28:13.912
-No wonder she had a big electro-magnetic field. 
-That's why the lights blew when she got upset.

28:13.912 --> 28:16.081
So, what's she doing?
Did we activate her?

28:16.081 --> 28:18.524
She couldn't be activated.
If she was, we'd all be dead.

28:19.307 --> 28:21.564
We took her off the network.

28:21.564 --> 28:22.888
She has some other agenda.

28:25.235 --> 28:27.162
Hey.

28:27.162 --> 28:29.324
How are you feeling?

28:30.331 --> 28:33.466
What's going on?
Nobody will tell me anything.

28:33.466 --> 28:37.134
-You all right?
-I'm fine.

28:40.584 --> 28:43.718
Listen, you know l love you, don't you?

28:43.718 --> 28:46.086
Course I do. I love you, too.

28:49.471 --> 28:51.941
-Do you promise? 
-Why?

28:51.941 --> 28:55.539
I just had to be sure.

28:56.838 --> 28:59.126
I have to go away.

28:59.126 --> 29:02.067
What do you mean? Where?

29:02.795 --> 29:07.152
I can't tell you, but it's for your own good.

29:07.152 --> 29:08.812
Beth, what are you talking about?

29:08.812 --> 29:13.185
No. I'm sorry. I just...
I have to stay away from you.

29:13.185 --> 29:17.188
If I don't...I'm gonna end up hurting you.

29:17.188 --> 29:20.906
Well, this is hurting me. Don't go.

29:23.017 --> 29:25.670
Whatever happens...

29:25.670 --> 29:28.756
just know that I love you...

29:28.756 --> 29:31.270
and I always will.

29:34.119 --> 29:37.632
If you've...If you've done something, 
I don't care,

29:37.632 --> 29:41.718
-just don't leave me. 
We'll get through this. 
-No, not this time.

29:41.718 --> 29:46.878
I have to put things straight, and I can't do that anywhere near you.

29:46.878 --> 29:50.287
-I love you too much for that. 
-Don't let the police take you!

29:51.573 --> 29:55.993
I'm not gonna let you go. I don't care what it is, I don't care what...

29:58.537 --> 30:02.638
-What was that? 
-I don't know. It sounded like...

30:20.259 --> 30:23.039
He... Help!

30:23.039 --> 30:25.383
Help! Somebody, get a doctor!

30:25.383 --> 30:27.385
Help!

30:27.385 --> 30:30.449
-Somebody!
-What are...

30:30.449 --> 30:32.836
Somebody!

30:32.836 --> 30:34.871
-Beth! 
-Sorry...

30:36.171 --> 30:40.251
I was just...It was an accident, 
I just wanted to say goodbye...

30:40.251 --> 30:43.818
She's got a weapon system built into her arm.

30:45.357 --> 30:47.484
Clear.

30:47.484 --> 30:50.814
It's getting worse. She's losing control, we need to contain her fast.

30:50.814 --> 30:52.429
Come on, Beth. Let's get you back.

30:52.429 --> 30:56.196
-No! No!
-Come on! Come on! Get up! Go.

31:00.593 --> 31:02.212
So, what else happened at school today?

31:02.212 --> 31:03.563
-Alex has got a girlfriend.
-Oh?

31:03.563 --> 31:05.536
-Have not! 
-Have too.

31:05.536 --> 31:08.986
-She's called jessica.
-I'm gonna kill you so much.

31:09.986 --> 31:13.218
-Patrick Grainger?
-Alex, don't kill your sister.

31:16.763 --> 31:19.063
Not before tea anyway!

31:19.170 --> 31:20.899
Patrick?

31:22.110 --> 31:23.181
0h, my God, stop it!

31:24.676 --> 31:25.801
Get away from him!

31:26.454 --> 31:30.908
Oh, no!
Please, don't hurt my children!

31:33.652 --> 31:36.171
No, please!

31:49.142 --> 31:52.978
Oi! Fuckflap! Get back in that truck or I'll shove it up your arse!

31:58.454 --> 32:00.468
0h, shit!

32:02.387 --> 32:04.671
Tosh? We got her. It's all over.
We're on our way.

32:10.237 --> 32:11.319
You OK?

32:11.319 --> 32:13.527
Yeah... I think so, yeah.

32:15.343 --> 32:17.162
-What the hell was that?
-Petrol tanker.

32:17.162 --> 32:21.280
Looks like someone wanted to take out the M4 link road for some...

32:21.280 --> 32:26.123
No! It's not the road. There's an underground fuel pipeline.

32:26.123 --> 32:28.608
It's the special fuel supply for the military, they use it in emergencies.

32:28.608 --> 32:29.921
Not any more. Hold on.

32:31.075 --> 32:33.366
I've got a report coming through.

32:33.366 --> 32:35.938
-Patrick Grainger's
been murdered.
-Who?

32:35.938 --> 32:39.495
Leader of the Council, stabbed several times in the chest, and once in the forehead.

32:39.495 --> 32:42.504
-Sound familiar?
-Why would anyone want to kill him?

32:42.504 --> 32:46.477
He's also the city co-ordinator.
Takes charge of the city during major emergencies,

32:46.477 --> 32:49.219
-has all the security protocols. 
-How do you know that?

32:49.219 --> 32:50.552
I know everything.

32:50.552 --> 32:52.389
And it says so on the screen.

32:52.389 --> 32:54.502
They're putting all the pieces in place.

32:54.502 --> 32:59.520
Gwen, take her. 
Tosh, Owen, it's starting, 
it's happening right now.

33:15.853 --> 33:18.556
Tosh? It's not just her.

33:18.556 --> 33:21.427
She's part of a cell, and they've activated.

33:21.427 --> 33:22.950
It's happening.

33:22.950 --> 33:25.121
-Tell me how to stop it!
-It can't be.

33:25.121 --> 33:28.974
-Think! 
-Beth, look at me.
Look at me!

33:28.974 --> 33:32.573
-How do we stop this? 
-I don't know.

33:34.233 --> 33:37.045
I'm cut off from the cell.
I don't know what the mission is. I'm sorry.

33:37.045 --> 33:39.384
What about your implant. 
How did you get out of Torchwood?

33:39.384 --> 33:43.832
The technology is part of me. 
I can switch it on, 
I can use the tools.

33:43.832 --> 33:46.091
Can you do that now? 
Can you trace the other cell?!

33:46.091 --> 33:47.746
No! What if it goes wrong?

33:47.746 --> 33:50.718
If you don't, Beth, 
other people will die. 
Not just Mike.

34:01.687 --> 34:04.227
There's only one left.

34:04.227 --> 34:06.852
-I can track him.
-Let's go. Come on.

34:25.574 --> 34:27.116
Hang on, I've got an idea.

34:29.648 --> 34:33.380
No. I can't just hook something up! 
The entire telephone network is down!

34:33.380 --> 34:37.610
-What about a mobile 
connection? 
-The entire telephone 
network is down!

34:37.610 --> 34:40.942
Mobiles, landlines, tin cans with bits of string.

34:40.942 --> 34:43.893
Everything. Absolutely everything. 
All phones broken.

34:43.893 --> 34:46.666
Hello? Anyone there? No, 
cos the phones aren't working.

34:46.666 --> 34:48.531
-What's that? 
-CB radio.

34:48.531 --> 34:54.132
They knocked out the phones, 
but they can't knock out the radio waves. 
Not yet, anyway.

34:54.132 --> 34:58.112
-What about we try... 
-There is no way of getting in touch with jack!

34:58.112 --> 35:01.514
-No way! 
-Tosh, Owen, can you hear me?

35:01.514 --> 35:02.854
Jack;

35:04.307 --> 35:06.575
-Thank God. What happened?
-There's a cell, it's active.

35:06.575 --> 35:10.325
Four including Beth, two are dead.
We're tracking the last guy now.

35:10.325 --> 35:13.576
-If we can get to him, 
we can stop this. 
-What can I do?

35:13.576 --> 35:17.530
He's heading for an abandoned farm outside the city. 
I need to know what's there.

35:23.668 --> 35:26.241
Where the hell's he going? 
There's nothing there!

35:26.241 --> 35:27.868
Nothing on the surface.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.393
-He's nearly there, we need to hurry.
-Hurrying, thank you.

35:32.393 --> 35:35.182
-What happens when it starts?
-How do you get in the heavy weapons?

35:35.182 --> 35:38.216
I don't know. 
I think we just have this arm stuff.

35:38.216 --> 35:40.107
How do you manage to take over so quickly?

35:40.107 --> 35:43.666
I don't know. I didn't even know how to use this thing until today.

35:46.766 --> 35:50.958
***************************

35:50.958 --> 35:53.562
The army sealed it off in the 'l??s, 
doesn't say why.

35:53.562 --> 35:55.910
Let me see if I can get into the military files.

35:58.024 --> 36:02.598
Come on, guys, 
that wasn't even difficult. 
You disappoint me.

36:02.598 --> 36:05.501
It's almost obscene 
what you do to security systems.

36:05.501 --> 36:08.059
-0h, God./What is it?
-The mineshaft.

36:08.059 --> 36:12.994
The military are using it for storage. 
Nuclear warheads. Ten of them.

36:12.994 --> 36:16.003
-Nobody's supposed to know, 
not even us.
-That's how it starts.

36:16.003 --> 36:19.539
-No heavy weapons.
-Exactly. They don't need any! 
They use our own against us.

36:20.627 --> 36:24.244
We left the key under the doormat. 
All you need is to walk in and take over.

36:24.244 --> 36:27.211
-Tell me you can stop it.
-Going as fast as we can.

36:27.211 --> 36:30.807
If we don't, we won't feel a thing.
We're at the centre of the blast radius.

36:30.807 --> 36:33.454
-That's comforting.
-Come on, have a little faith!

36:33.454 --> 36:36.726
With a dashing hero like me on the case, 
how can we fail?

36:40.752 --> 36:42.962
He is dashing, you have to give him that.

36:44.817 --> 36:47.215
-And what if they can't stop it?
-They'll stop it.

36:47.215 --> 36:51.100
-Yeah, but if they can't? 
-Then it's all over.

36:52.087 --> 36:53.951
Let's all have sex.

36:54.973 --> 36:57.684
I thought the end of the world couldn't get any worse.

37:10.356 --> 37:13.095
Halt! Stop the vehicle!

37:13.095 --> 37:15.150
Get out ofthe vehicle now!

37:15.150 --> 37:17.931
Lie face down on the ground!

37:17.931 --> 37:20.268
0n the ground or we shoot!

37:20.268 --> 37:21.603
Fire!

38:38.304 --> 38:42.745
-Have we thought this part of the plan through? 
-This isn't gonna be pretty, 
brace yourselves.

38:42.745 --> 38:45.236
-How are we going to stop him, Jack?
-Like this.

39:04.093 --> 39:07.189
This wasn't supposed to happen today. How do we stop it?

39:09.461 --> 39:12.589
Gwen? Gwen!

39:16.289 --> 39:17.961
It doesn't matter.

39:19.177 --> 39:21.557
You can't stop us.

39:22.533 --> 39:24.186
We know what your weakness is.

39:24.186 --> 39:30.571
We know who you are, jack Harkness. 
We know all about you, and Torchwood.

39:30.571 --> 39:35.443
We got a lot of information before you switched her off.

39:36.728 --> 39:39.686
You'll be factored into our plans.

39:39.686 --> 39:41.553
-Gwen? 
-Nearly there.

39:42.291 --> 39:43.676
I've got it. He's done.

39:48.653 --> 39:51.800
Don't bother, your transmitter's dead.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.840
-So is your force-field.
-You're lying.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.410
0h, yeah?

39:57.318 --> 39:59.512
Factor that into your plans.

40:00.892 --> 40:02.753
Now, when are the others coming?

40:04.006 --> 40:05.665
They're already here.

40:09.182 --> 40:11.286
I won't let you take me.

40:12.176 --> 40:13.239
Run!

40:42.182 --> 40:43.841
It's done.

40:44.684 --> 40:47.556
-I'll do it, but I'm not happy.
-just do what you have to.

41:01.580 --> 41:04.273
We're set with the cryogenics when you're ready.

41:05.566 --> 41:07.221
Will it work this time?

41:07.498 --> 41:11.427
Tosh has reconfigured the casket.
It'll work around the implant.

41:12.471 --> 41:16.504
-No more false images.
-If we'd been one minute later

41:16.504 --> 41:17.796
We weren't.

41:19.177 --> 41:23.051
-We stopped him.
-What happens when you have to stop me?

41:24.577 --> 41:28.909
-If the freezing doesn't work?
-It won't come to that.

41:28.909 --> 41:35.633
I can feel it coming.
It's pushing me out.

41:35.633 --> 41:39.353
What will you do when I lose my last bit of me?

41:39.353 --> 41:41.610
We will figure something out, Beth.

41:41.610 --> 41:43.362
No, we won't.

41:45.054 --> 41:47.761
I'm too dangerous for that, 
we both know it.

41:49.917 --> 41:53.484
Do you...have someone...

41:53.484 --> 41:55.140
at home?

41:55.140 --> 41:56.759
A fiance.

41:58.211 --> 42:00.426
Have you ever hurt them?

42:00.426 --> 42:02.113
More than once, yes.

42:04.489 --> 42:06.759
Remember how guilty you felt?

42:07.944 --> 42:11.582
Imagine that...times a billion...

42:13.055 --> 42:17.345
all the time...every second of the day.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.641
That's how I feel now.

42:22.270 --> 42:27.282
And the worst part is, 
when I turn back,

42:27.282 --> 42:32.174
I won't feel guilty any more.
I'll want to carry out my mission.

42:33.940 --> 42:37.891
I won't even care about Mike.
I'll forget all about him.

42:42.107 --> 42:44.922
I don't wanna die as one of those things, Gwen.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.681
-I don't wanna forget about Mike.
-Then don't.

42:52.028 --> 42:57.984
Let's do this. Who knows 
what we'll be able to do 
in a month? A year?

42:57.984 --> 43:00.556
Thanks for being so good to me.

43:02.860 --> 43:05.595
Remember me the way I am now.

43:07.787 --> 43:10.331
Remember...Beth.

43:17.106 --> 43:18.604
Beth...

43:22.374 --> 43:23.697
Beth...

43:25.694 --> 43:28.509
I won't let you freeze me!

43:28.509 --> 43:30.566
I'll kill you all!

43:30.566 --> 43:32.986
Let her go! Let her go!

43:32.986 --> 43:37.992
No! Wait, wait, wait, don't shoot! It's a trick.
She won't hurt me.

43:37.992 --> 43:39.540
Move away from her now!

43:39.540 --> 43:41.603
Everybody, calm down!

43:42.137 --> 43:46.046
Beth.....you don't want to do this.

43:46.046 --> 43:47.505
Let Gwen go.

43:48.675 --> 43:53.432
I'll kill her first, then all of you, 
then the rest of your miserable species!

43:53.432 --> 43:56.607
Beth, please! They will kill you.
You have proved to be better than that,

43:56.607 --> 44:00.486
you helped us to stop the invasion. You can be human. Please!

44:02.846 --> 44:05.364
-Not human enough. 
-Beth.

44:07.443 --> 44:09.031
Goodbye, Gwen.

44:10.112 --> 44:11.298
Good luck.

44:31.177 --> 44:33.514
She wanted you to shoot her!

44:36.451 --> 44:38.926
She used her last shred of humanity to do this.

44:40.588 --> 44:42.009
We couldn't take that chance.

44:43.040 --> 44:45.482
She must have known that.

44:45.482 --> 44:47.258
She did.

44:49.296 --> 44:52.063
She just wanted to make it easier for us.

45:44.124 --> 45:46.036
Do you think we stopped it?

45:46.655 --> 45:50.254
Maybe. Maybe we've just put it off for a while, I don't know.

45:50.254 --> 45:53.009
-We don't know anything.
-We know plenty.

45:53.778 --> 45:57.899
We know about the implant.
We can disable their force-field.

45:57.899 --> 46:02.237
We know how they attack.
We know that they can be killed.

46:02.354 --> 46:04.887
While they think they have 
the element of surprise,
we know they haven't.

46:04.887 --> 46:08.612
But, until that day, 
we just keep doing what we do.

46:08.612 --> 46:12.881
0h, them be fightin' words,
they be, Gwen.

46:17.131 --> 46:22.137
-So, have you set a date?
-Oh, don't get me started, please.

46:22.137 --> 46:24.084
My mam's already been on the phone, saying,

46:24.084 --> 46:27.117
'What about the local church? It's ever so lovely.'

46:27.117 --> 46:28.768
Go home.

46:33.463 --> 46:35.040
Keep doing what we do.

46:39.367 --> 46:40.940
Good night, jack.

47:03.149 --> 47:04.985
He's a frozen soldier from 1918.

47:04.985 --> 47:08.208
-We have to wake him up every 12 months. 
-Leave me alone!

47:08.208 --> 47:10.648
-It's me. Toshiko. 
-Is it time again?

47:10.648 --> 47:13.325
Two different times should never exist simultaneously.

47:13.325 --> 47:15.333
You shouldn't be here!

47:15.333 --> 47:18.214
Chunks of 1918 will start to appear at the hospital.

47:18.214 --> 47:20.362
We've got a few ghosts.

47:20.362 --> 47:21.901
I think you'd better come with us.

47:21.901 --> 47:25.432
He needs to be in the hospital, ready to step from one time to another.

47:25.432 --> 47:29.203
-You're the only one who can stop this. 
-Why me?!

47:29.203 --> 47:33.965
It's not years in the future. It's now.

47:33.965 --> 47:37.858
