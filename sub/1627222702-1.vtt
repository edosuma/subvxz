WEBVTT

00:58.141 --> 01:00.977
All I was doing
is what I was trained to do.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.104
-That's how I think of it, so…

01:03.188 --> 01:05.523
You realize
how weak and fragile you are.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.359
This was his first day
going to that office.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.820
-We had his picture posted.
-He was happy.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.363
I have pulmonary fibrosis…

01:12.447 --> 01:15.533
When I saw the building
come down, I just prayed, you know.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.494
I don't know
if we were just in denial.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.163
-Thought he'd end up in the trash.
-They're done digging.

01:20.246 --> 01:23.500
-Don't know how it could get easy.
-Have to come to terms with it.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.211
-The rest of them, all gone.
-I lost a son.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.548
You want other information?

01:35.011 --> 01:36.096
I'll say this.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.264
I'm angry.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.309
I'm angry with God,

01:42.519 --> 01:45.688
I'm angry with our country, also,
because they let this happen.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.654
My beautiful boy…

01:55.573 --> 01:57.075
…was burned alive

01:58.118 --> 01:59.327
because of them.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.833
We don't… We don't even have a body.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.631
If someone took your child…

02:13.466 --> 02:14.551
and blew them up…

02:20.473 --> 02:22.433
He didn't even have a fingernail.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.110
How do you go on from there?

02:35.196 --> 02:37.115
How do you calculate that?

02:41.536 --> 02:46.875
-What is life worth?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.128
Not a trick question, people.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.090
Who's gonna give us a number? Uh…

02:54.632 --> 02:58.887
Back row. Uh, you there, Mr. Barron.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.265
Big boy voice here, counselor.
Tell us, where are you from?

03:02.348 --> 03:04.225
I was raised in Wichita.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.685
Kansas. Farm boy.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.563
Good, good, good.
You were raised on one, a farm?

03:08.646 --> 03:11.149
My girlfriend's father owned one.
He grew sorghum.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.066
Sorghum.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.527
Girlfriend's father grew sorghum.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.654
Miss Paula Tano.

03:17.363 --> 03:21.409
Miss Paula Tano, you are now
Mr. Barron's girlfriend's father.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.829
Don't laugh, people, it's very sad.

03:24.913 --> 03:29.584
Mr. Barron just died,
tragically crushed by a combine harvester

03:29.667 --> 03:32.545
in Miss Paula Tano's sorghum field.

03:32.629 --> 03:36.549
Mr. Dickerson,
you're now representing Mr. Barron.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.967
And where's Miss Chen?

03:38.551 --> 03:42.055
Miss Chen, you're representing
Amalgamated Caterpillar,

03:42.138 --> 03:45.266
manufacturer of said combine harvester,

03:45.350 --> 03:48.186
which took poor young Mr. Barron's life,

03:48.269 --> 03:50.355
in the Kansas state civil action

03:50.438 --> 03:55.652
of Mr. Barron v. Mr. Barron's
girlfriend's father's sorghum farm

03:55.735 --> 03:57.153
and the Caterpillar company.

03:57.237 --> 04:01.282
So, Miss Chen, how much do you offer
Mr. Dickerson to settle this?

04:04.953 --> 04:07.789
All right, let me rephrase.

04:09.165 --> 04:13.795
How much is Mr. Barron's life worth?

04:13.878 --> 04:15.046
Give us a number.

04:16.506 --> 04:17.507
Two million?

04:18.174 --> 04:20.093
Hey, I'm in law school.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.095
I could be earning that before I'm 30.

04:23.304 --> 04:27.141
If you aced the final, maybe,
and if you weren't dead, but you are.

04:28.268 --> 04:32.272
This is now Mr. Dickerson's decision,
along with Mr… Your name?

04:32.355 --> 04:33.606
-Patel.
-Patel.

04:33.690 --> 04:37.652
Mr. Patel is the poor bereaved mother
of Mr. Barron.

04:40.780 --> 04:41.781
Three million?

04:42.407 --> 04:43.533
Two-point-seven.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.285
Deal.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.788
There you have it. There's the deal.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.918
To be clear, you haven't stumbled
into a philosophy course.

04:54.002 --> 04:57.797
Where the law is concerned,
this question actually has an answer.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.882
And the answer is a number,

05:00.883 --> 05:02.468
and that's the job.

05:19.819 --> 05:23.114
No. Yes, 55 per victim.

05:23.197 --> 05:26.117
Yeah, and both sides agreed to walk.
That's right.

05:26.617 --> 05:29.954
No one thinks it's fair,
but fair is not the goal here.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.123
It's finish and move on.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.459
Yeah. Well, thank you, Senator.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.961
Mr. Feinberg, you have a message
from Judge Clinton.

05:37.045 --> 05:37.879
Thank you, Vic.

05:37.962 --> 05:41.716
Just remember me when POTUS calls
about a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.302
I saw Rehnquist the other day.
He's looking pale.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.387
I said he's looking pale.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.765
He-- Hello?

05:49.599 --> 05:50.475
I think I lost him.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.560
-Probably a good thing.
-It was a joke.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.271
Usually the funny ones,
you don't have to announce that after.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.899
I just saved the taxpayers
a year's worth of courtroom.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.400
Do you think he really hung up?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.235
I'm sure he's off
commissioning a monument.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.196
-I have a forum to run.
-No way.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.199
Mr. Darryl Barnes, Esq.
I have an important question for you.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.493
-Is this birthday cake?
-Margo in Accounting.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.660
Mmm.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.913
-Is that the important question?
-No.

06:11.996 --> 06:13.623
Did she save any for you?

06:13.706 --> 06:15.917
Gloria, where are we on that email?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.877
"And so I would ask…"

06:17.960 --> 06:19.962
And so I would insist…

06:20.046 --> 06:22.340
Not "ask," "insist."

06:22.965 --> 06:24.258
…that you be on time.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.261
I have a very busy schedule that day,

06:27.345 --> 06:30.348
so punctuality will be imperative.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.019
Please promptly advise.

06:35.937 --> 06:36.938
"Love, Dad"?

06:37.480 --> 06:40.191
Huh? Yeah, yeah. Love, Dad.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.693
-Okay. I'll type this up right now.
-Thank you.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.219
Remind me why we're building this

07:08.302 --> 07:10.930
instead of buying that cute little place
on Cape Charles?

07:11.013 --> 07:13.099
-Fog.
-You could still commute.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.810
The numbers show Cape Charles
is more than twice as likely

07:15.893 --> 07:17.395
to be fogged in on any given day.

07:17.478 --> 07:20.857
-That's not a real statistic.
-Two-point-two is the statistic.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.233
If you wanna retire to that.

07:22.316 --> 07:26.362
Well, I have heard that people that base
their future happiness on weather data

07:26.446 --> 07:29.198
-are 100% less likely to be fun.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.034
Why does he only just looks at me?
Do you mind?

07:32.118 --> 07:33.911
You're not retiring anyway.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.046
Good night, Kenny.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.037
Because they want to put in
another shoe store.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.248
We need another one of those.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.876
They wanna take out
those beautiful arched windows.

09:03.960 --> 09:09.131
You know, the ones that have
the Corinthian carved cartouche-y things.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.008
They wanna take them out
and put in modern ones

09:11.092 --> 09:13.219
so they can hawk more sneakers. It's just…

09:13.761 --> 09:15.096
Not on your watch.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.890
No. No. Now you're mocking me.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.810
There's chicken piccata
in the fridge.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.062
I'm going to post this. Just wait.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.981
Power to the people.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.857
Yep.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.799
Yeah, you can take it first.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.968
-Who's that?
-You can take it apart.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.678
-Hey, love.
-Morning.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.096
You can snap that back in,

09:57.179 --> 10:00.266
take it apart and…
A shorter wing span. Just putting--

10:00.349 --> 10:02.727
All right, come eat, please.
Breakfast is ready.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.022
-Quickly.
-Yay, breakfast!

10:06.105 --> 10:07.815
-Thank you.
-Owen, slow down.

10:07.898 --> 10:08.899
Oh, this way.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.444
Gotta go. Love ya.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.447
And here's, uh,
exactly the one that I got.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.035
-What are we doing after school?
-All right.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.037
Mom!

10:43.726 --> 10:45.102
I can't see anything.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.566
-Right now, I don't see anything.

10:51.859 --> 10:52.860
Are you sure?

11:01.243 --> 11:02.703
…freaking out, hold on.

11:02.787 --> 11:03.621
Yeah.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.793
Yeah, how you doing?
What's going on?

11:09.293 --> 11:12.046
-Excuse me, sir, is there any--
-Can't talk.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.547
Excuse me?

11:14.131 --> 11:16.676
-What's happening?
-Did you find her somewhere?

11:23.974 --> 11:25.226
Turn on the TV.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.314
Oh my God.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.234
Yes, we see it.

11:37.446 --> 11:40.408
The shock from the attacks
in New York and D.C.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.910
-reverberate across the entire nation.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.246
Our correspondent,
Tanya Riddle, has been told

11:45.329 --> 11:48.374
that state officials are working
to strengthen security all across…

11:48.457 --> 11:50.334
Officials
at Somerset County Airport

11:50.418 --> 11:53.504
confirm the crash of a large plane
north of that airport.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.923
The army has been placed
at Prescott, Delta.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.800
Firefighters
and police officers

11:57.883 --> 11:59.427
are frantically trying to help

11:59.510 --> 12:02.555
those people who have been hurt,
who perhaps have not been rescued.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.306
With tragedy so great,

12:04.390 --> 12:08.936
tonight, a city comes together
searching for safety and comfort.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.106
…of a hundred waiting
for their turn

12:12.189 --> 12:14.442
to go into the World Trade Center area.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.862
…the days to come,
to the rescue those who may be alive.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.281
So we have, at this point,

12:20.364 --> 12:23.784
well over a thousand people
confirmed dead.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.745
The 300 that are missing
that he talked about,

12:25.828 --> 12:27.455
the 800 at the Pentagon,

12:27.538 --> 12:31.709
266 who were on those airplanes today,
passengers and crew.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.254
Uh, we're now up to about 1300,

12:35.337 --> 12:37.423
and it is expected to go much higher.

12:37.506 --> 12:41.051
Twenty-four hundred people altogether
were killed in Pearl Harbor.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.012
They were military personnel
for the most part.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.765
It was a military attack
on military installations.

12:45.848 --> 12:46.766
We know who did it.

12:46.849 --> 12:50.644
This is a different kind of a war
in a new century.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.541
…that involves so many people?

13:13.083 --> 13:16.462
Well, I think all of that
is going to have to be sifted out.

13:16.545 --> 13:20.090
I think that in the midst
of our outrage and anger,

13:20.174 --> 13:22.426
uh, President Bush is right,

13:22.510 --> 13:27.431
we have to show the world
how we respond to this

13:27.515 --> 13:31.060
uh, both with determination, uh…

13:31.644 --> 13:34.230
-So, what did you tell Kennedy?
-That I'd think about it.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.316
That you're my partner,
and I'd have to talk to you.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.068
Hah. Hmm.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.569
I mean, I know why he asked us.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.947
We're one of five or six firms
with this kind of experience.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.365
If that. If that.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.617
-Yeah. Asbestos, Agent Orange.
-Yeah.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.744
Those were hot-button cases too.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.748
Yeah. I'll let you know
how the committee hearing goes.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.542
-Yeah.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.064
Thanks for coming.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.275
-I know Teddy appreciates it.
-Sure.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.694
We want our best trial lawyers.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.946
We'll be needing your support
on this thing.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.533
-Yeah.
-Your people okay?

14:27.616 --> 14:29.076
-Kids, family?
-Yeah. Yeah.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.328
Mike was at his dorm at NYU.
He's all right.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.998
He was shaken up, but, uh… What thing?

14:34.081 --> 14:35.541
A new bill on the floor.

14:35.624 --> 14:39.336
The Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.882
-Wait, they're bailing out the airlines?
-More like the whole economy.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.344
If the victims of these attacks
or their families

14:47.428 --> 14:51.056
attempt to sue the airline industry
for damages, we will go bankrupt.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.977
And never mind whether they win or not,
the legal costs alone…

14:55.060 --> 14:58.647
And that's when we might as well
just hand those terrorists the victory,

14:59.148 --> 15:00.441
because we're paralyzed.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.735
Deliveries, commuter travel.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.778
The whole economy grinding to a halt.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.865
What we're facing is a national emergency.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.199
-Mm-hmm.
-Lee?

15:09.283 --> 15:10.242
Ken?

15:10.326 --> 15:12.995
-Help us come up with another way.
-Right.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.998
Ah, brass tacks here.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.959
You're trying to prevent
lawsuits from the victims.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.337
-That's what they're saying.
-That's not what we're saying.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.713
It's called due process.

15:22.796 --> 15:25.883
Limit. We're saying limit civil suits
against the airlines.

15:25.966 --> 15:30.220
Denying recourse to the people
most impacted by these attacks.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.597
Stop grandstanding.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.433
What we're proposing
is a treasury fund

15:34.516 --> 15:37.519
offering tort-style compensation
to the victims.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.397
For their economic losses,
something for pain and suffering.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.442
Yes, but coming from us, Congress,
not the courts.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.779
And in exchange,
the claimants promise not to sue.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.906
-Corporate bailout.
-Chrissakes, Lee.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.033
-What, you're calling it charity?

15:51.116 --> 15:53.619
Yes. Government-sponsored charity.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.496
With strings attached?

15:56.664 --> 15:58.248
Ken, help me out here.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.709
A lawsuit could take decades.

16:00.793 --> 16:01.794
Yes.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.296
After it crashes the economy.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.966
And the victims might still lose.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.094
This is for their own good,
and the nation's.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.141
Yeah. How many, uh…

16:16.850 --> 16:18.477
How many victims are there?

16:21.188 --> 16:23.399
Well, we don't really know yet.

16:26.193 --> 16:30.030
A special master we select
will have to negotiate all settlements.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.865
A flat fee would
be another option.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.159
The same dollar value
for every loss of life.

16:34.243 --> 16:38.706
But those towers had CEOs and janitors.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.333
They won't all say yes to the same number.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.210
And even if they did,

16:43.293 --> 16:46.463
anybody wanna go on record
with what that number is?

16:49.008 --> 16:52.845
Yeah, well, pretty soon somebody's
gonna have to do the vulgar work

16:52.928 --> 16:54.722
of putting numbers on a check.

17:01.603 --> 17:05.899
So you're saying, what,
you wanna do this job?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.444
Well, no, I mean…

17:08.527 --> 17:12.906
Well, I mean,
we're discussing it right now, so…

17:15.159 --> 17:18.245
Look, you're telling me
you're not sick about it,

17:18.328 --> 17:19.830
watching all this on TV?

17:21.373 --> 17:23.625
-Of course I'm sick about it.
-Well…

17:24.168 --> 17:28.088
Well, it's just tough stuff, Kenny.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.382
I know, I know. It is very tough, yeah.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.926
And you're not exactly…

17:33.010 --> 17:33.844
What?

17:34.344 --> 17:37.473
You're not a rabbi or a priest,
you're a lawyer.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.434
I know. And that's exactly
what these people need right now.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.063
There's a process here, you know.
I hire a team,

17:44.146 --> 17:47.066
I draft an objective formula,

17:47.149 --> 17:49.526
and I dispense reasonable payments.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.569
Just like that?

17:50.652 --> 17:54.156
Yeah, it's no different
than my previous cases in that regard.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.659
Look, this is something I'm good at.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.745
This is something…

18:01.789 --> 18:03.874
This is something I can do to help.

18:15.177 --> 18:19.056
Judge Weinstein told me
how you reached a settlement on DES.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.934
Ten years of courthouse war.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.394
You brought both sides to a motel room,

18:24.478 --> 18:26.355
told them they could stay
as long as they wanted,

18:26.438 --> 18:29.066
but they couldn't leave
until they reached a settlement.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.901
-Is that really true?
-It is.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.612
-I did let them order room service.

18:33.695 --> 18:36.073
You know, Attorney General, I…

18:37.282 --> 18:38.700
People are rational animals.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.370
I find if you…
if you force them to the table,

18:41.453 --> 18:44.164
most behave in a way
that makes the most sense.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.376
It's hard to believe
you live in Washington.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.879
Well, in politics, uh, conflict sells.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.715
I find that what works best is compromise.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.135
No one walks away too happy,

18:56.218 --> 18:58.053
just happy enough to walk away.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.974
And when you walk away today,
what outcome makes you happy enough?

19:03.058 --> 19:04.893
I'd like to have the job, John.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.437
No one wants this job.

19:08.397 --> 19:12.359
Well, that narrows down
your options.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.613
I suppose it does.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.908
Except that you're a Democrat,

19:20.617 --> 19:23.829
Teddy's former chief of staff.
Did you hope I'd overlook that?

19:23.912 --> 19:26.832
Well, I was hoping
you could see that as a good thing.

19:26.915 --> 19:29.376
I mean, you said yourself,
this is a hot potato.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.795
You know if you give it to an insider,

19:31.879 --> 19:35.174
you know, a party man
or friend of the president, then…

19:35.257 --> 19:37.467
-They'll blame us if it fails.
-Right.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.638
Pick me, it's the opposition's fault.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.600
Unless for some reason, you know,

19:44.683 --> 19:47.102
by some miracle, I pull this off,
in which case…

19:47.186 --> 19:48.520
Don't we look open-minded,

19:48.604 --> 19:51.106
reaching all the way
across the aisle to find you.

19:52.149 --> 19:55.861
It is felt, and I'm speaking
for the White House here,

19:55.944 --> 19:59.823
that for the program
to succeed in staving off

19:59.907 --> 20:02.868
a full-on economic cataclysm,

20:03.410 --> 20:07.956
no fewer than 80%
of eligible claimants must opt in.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.835
That means voluntarily choose not to sue.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.630
Uh, that shouldn't be a problem.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.717
Well, congratulations, Special Master.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.429
-You got any more surprises for me?
-Yeah.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.765
I'd like to work for free.

20:26.099 --> 20:29.186
Uh, hey, everyone come in here for just a…

20:29.728 --> 20:32.731
Uh, Camille and I want to thank you

20:32.814 --> 20:36.526
for shouldering the firm's
day-to-day responsibilities

20:36.610 --> 20:40.405
while we devote our time to this pro bono.

20:40.989 --> 20:44.910
Uh, it's not gonna be easy,
and we sure welcome all of your help.

20:44.993 --> 20:48.664
But if we do our job
the way I know we can,

20:48.747 --> 20:52.417
well, we just might make a difference.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.963
So thank you. And, uh… Thank you.

21:00.884 --> 21:01.843
Thanks again.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.936
This is you psyching yourself up,
or considering a quick escape?

21:12.437 --> 21:14.856
When's the last time
I took on something I couldn't handle?

21:14.940 --> 21:18.318
-Well, Brockton track meet, 1961.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.403
I came in second.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.363
And you still remember who beat you.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.447
Phil Leonardo.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.324
And I was robbed, by the way.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.578
You don't know how to lose, Kenny.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.873
Yeah, well, this one's, you know,

21:33.250 --> 21:34.584
not that kind of case.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.170
There is no winning.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.839
That's what I'm afraid of.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.383
Ken. Call for you.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.343
It's the president.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.223
Wanna take it here?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.558
-Yeah.
-Line one.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.104
Yeah, this is Ken Feinberg.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.981
Please hold for the president.

21:56.064 --> 21:58.233
-Well… Hello, Mr. President.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.320
-Ken? Is this Ken Feinberg?
-Yeah.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.572
Ken, I wanna
congratulate you on this thing.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.824
-Yeah. Yeah, Ashcroft was impressed.
-Well--

22:05.907 --> 22:08.618
Listen, you're taking
the heat on this, okay?

22:08.702 --> 22:11.747
Now, I would not wish this job
on my worst enemy.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.041
They tell me you're type of guy
that takes no prisoners.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.751
-Well--

22:15.834 --> 22:18.211
I'm kidding you, counselor.
I like to josh.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.838
-Did I scare you off?
-No, sir.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.215
No, no, sir. I'm still here.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.925
No, there you are. Okay, good.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.012
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you very much.

22:27.095 --> 22:29.097
And, look, you won't regret this.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.724
Sure hope not.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.518
Okay.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.435
-Morning.
-Good morning.

23:56.518 --> 23:59.771
Ah, I assume you've all met,
but this is Priya Khundi.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.525
Priya graduated first
in my class last year, Georgetown.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.903
And after she passed the bar,
I offered her a place here,

24:06.987 --> 24:10.115
but she, very politely, turned me down

24:10.907 --> 24:13.076
for a big, fancy company
down on Wall Street.

24:13.618 --> 24:17.414
Their main office
was on the 98th floor of the North Tower.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.792
-Ah.
-So we're very lucky to have her.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.920
Do you all have copies of the statute?

24:24.004 --> 24:25.922
H.R.2926,

24:26.006 --> 24:29.634
the Airline Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.137
Okay, who's read it? Great.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.972
-Did it take you long?
-Not really.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.266
-You wanna know why?
-Because it's short?

24:36.349 --> 24:40.187
Uh, yeah, that
and there's no law in this law.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.732
What it says is the victims
and their families will be compensated

24:43.815 --> 24:46.776
based on economic value lost.

24:46.860 --> 24:51.031
What that means,
they left up to the special master. Us.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.241
It's up to us to write the rules.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.202
Ken and I have done it in other cases

24:55.285 --> 24:57.871
and it is always messy,
so get ready for it.

24:58.538 --> 25:01.917
Like, who's eligible?
Who gets how much? Where we draw the line?

25:02.626 --> 25:03.710
Where do we start?

25:08.632 --> 25:10.300
Eighty percent, Priya.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.052
That's our target from the DOJ.

25:12.135 --> 25:14.346
If we don't hit that number,
the plan won't work.

25:14.429 --> 25:16.056
Any fewer claimants come aboard,

25:16.139 --> 25:19.184
the lawsuits that result
could crater the economy.

25:19.267 --> 25:21.520
-So we're told.
-No pressure, people.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.649
For every claimant,
we'll need to calculate a dollar value

25:25.732 --> 25:28.985
for the human loss,
whether it's loss of limb or loss of life.

25:29.069 --> 25:32.489
Most of the people who died that day
were providers for their families.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.366
We can't bring them back,

25:34.449 --> 25:36.910
but we can help their loved ones
pay their bills.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.286
Now you people understand

25:38.370 --> 25:42.249
we're not gonna be able to haggle
every case subjectively.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.376
That's where the math comes in.

25:44.459 --> 25:47.087
So we're, uh, we're gonna need a rubric.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.673
These are the latest
actuarial tables

25:49.756 --> 25:52.592
from the top casualty
in life insurance companies.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.262
We'll use these numbers as a basis.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.305
Here, you guys study up on these

25:57.389 --> 25:59.808
and help Camille come up with a proposal.

26:00.642 --> 26:05.063
Okay, so West Street, South Ferry,

26:05.897 --> 26:07.232
Lower Broadway,

26:08.191 --> 26:09.985
and Canal Street.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.611
Okay, here's one.

26:12.112 --> 26:15.240
What if there are multiple dependents?
How do we decide who gets the money?

26:15.323 --> 26:16.950
Where there's a will, we follow it.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.619
-And where there isn't one?
-We follow the state law.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.038
The state they died in,
or the state they came from?

26:22.122 --> 26:25.208
-The state of residence.
-What about domestic partners?

26:25.292 --> 26:26.543
What do we do about them?

26:29.087 --> 26:30.714
Let's talk about the deadline.

26:31.298 --> 26:34.426
The statute gives us two years
and a month from today.

26:34.509 --> 26:37.637
That's December 22nd, 2003.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.014
That feels short.

26:39.097 --> 26:42.350
-Well, not for families in grief.
-We could file for an extension.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.769
Ah-ah-ah. Don't you dare. No, no, no.

26:44.853 --> 26:48.773
If we extend it, they'll hem
and they'll haw, and they won't act.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.026
Deadline is our friend here.

26:53.153 --> 26:56.406
Okay, what are we forgetting?

26:57.198 --> 26:58.450
Their names.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.578
So far, we have a dozen lists,
but nothing comprehensive.

27:01.661 --> 27:05.790
The flight manifests and the Pentagon,
those are the easy ones.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.460
NYPD and FDNY, they have lists.

27:08.543 --> 27:12.130
The big companies like Cantor Fitzgerald,
they're putting some lists together,

27:12.213 --> 27:15.967
but as for the records
of who passed through the doors that day…

27:16.051 --> 27:17.135
They're all gone.

27:17.218 --> 27:19.554
We don't even know
how many names we're looking for.

30:12.602 --> 30:15.146
Relax.
We've done this kind of thing before.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.691
No, this one is raw.
Those aren't lawyers out there.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.443
Good, I can't stand lawyers.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.279
What are you, running for office?

30:23.363 --> 30:25.615
Come on, be a person, not a politician.

30:25.698 --> 30:26.741
Mmm.

30:28.785 --> 30:29.619
Thank you.

30:30.119 --> 30:32.330
-Okay. Good luck.
-Thank you.

30:47.804 --> 30:48.847
Good afternoon.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.015
Uh, thank you for coming.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.601
Uh, as you may know,
I am Kenneth Feinberg.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.311
I am the special master

30:55.979 --> 31:01.109
of the September 11th
Victim Compensation Fund.

31:01.609 --> 31:05.446
Um, I would like today to tell you--

31:09.075 --> 31:13.746
Um, I'd… I'd like to tell you
how the 9/11 fund will work.

31:13.830 --> 31:18.126
You've all been given copies of this,
the presumptive claims formula.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.043
Yes.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.254
Um, and quite soon,

31:21.337 --> 31:25.842
we'll be sending this along to Congress
for a comment period.

31:26.509 --> 31:27.343
What?

31:27.427 --> 31:30.471
Upon approval,
there will be no further changes.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.515
-Mr. Feinberg?
-I got a question.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.183
-I'm sorry.
-I got a question.

31:34.267 --> 31:37.270
If you could hold your questions
till after my remarks.

31:37.812 --> 31:42.692
Now, I'd ask you to refer to the table
at the top of page two.

31:46.362 --> 31:50.116
So as you can see, the formula
is actually fairly streamlined.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.367
Why do we need one?

31:51.451 --> 31:54.370
-Please just hold your question.
-Why do we need a formula?

31:54.454 --> 31:55.580
Yeah.

31:55.663 --> 31:57.665
Why isn't it equal payment
for everybody?

31:57.749 --> 31:58.833
Yeah!

31:58.917 --> 32:02.253
My daughter's life was worth just as much
as anybody in a corner office.

32:03.004 --> 32:06.507
Unfortunately, that aspect of the law
has been out of our control.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.843
My boy was a firefighter.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.096
Was he… Was he worth less

32:12.931 --> 32:16.809
than the… than the guy pushing pencils
and trading stock?

32:16.893 --> 32:18.478
-No.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.858
Certainly not… not as a human being, no.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.860
Their… Their lives ended the same way.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.820
But their mortgages did differ.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.030
How dare you!

32:29.113 --> 32:31.866
He's just trying to shut us up
so we don't sue.

32:32.742 --> 32:33.910
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:33.993 --> 32:36.788
-Have they… Has it started already?
-They're just starting.

32:36.871 --> 32:39.082
-Good, okay.
-Would you like a claims form?

32:39.165 --> 32:42.001
Uh, no, I have my own.
I printed it off the web.

32:42.085 --> 32:45.171
And there's a typo on page three
that you should know about.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.006
-And also, there are…
-Okay.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.926
-I should sign in here, right?
-Yes, please do.

32:53.179 --> 32:55.890
There… And there are more issues
that need to be addressed.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.476
They're substantive, okay.
And they need to be addressed.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.477
Okay.

33:03.773 --> 33:06.484
I mean…
Look, as a legal professional,

33:06.567 --> 33:09.153
I know chasing a lawsuit is a big mistake.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.989
-Did you lose anybody?
-Look--

33:11.072 --> 33:14.325
-Did you lose anybody in your family?
-I just… Let me explain.

33:14.409 --> 33:20.164
Congress mandated
that I calculate the economic value.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.208
-Economical.

33:22.291 --> 33:23.418
Please.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.253
You're just afraid of being sued.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.088
-I understand how it is.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.257
-Understand?
-Look, please.

33:29.757 --> 33:32.719
-What I mean is, I sympathize.
-Who did you lose?

33:32.802 --> 33:35.013
Listen, as a legal professional,
I will tell you,

33:35.096 --> 33:36.973
it will be years in court.

33:37.056 --> 33:38.975
You might win, you might not.

33:39.642 --> 33:42.020
This is fast money and it's tax-free.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.147
Put your thinking caps on.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.149
This is the only game in town.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.568
-How dare you!
-You think this is a game?

33:49.068 --> 33:50.862
-I'm sorry.
-This isn't a game!

33:50.945 --> 33:53.740
-What do you know about law?
-Who do you think you are?

33:53.823 --> 33:56.284
We lost brothers.
Now they sent some Jew lawyer…

33:59.203 --> 34:02.707
I wish… I wish we could spit on your grave
the way you spit on ours.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.959
-Please.
-Wait, everyone. Wait, wait.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.629
This man, he did not cause our situation.

34:09.297 --> 34:14.218
He's here to tell us how the government
intends to deal with it.

34:14.302 --> 34:17.430
And I for one
would just like to hear him out.

34:18.806 --> 34:19.640
Thank you.

34:19.724 --> 34:20.725
Thank you.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.102
Thank you. And I… I was…

34:23.186 --> 34:27.065
Uh, look, as I was…

34:27.565 --> 34:30.568
This meeting is only…

34:30.651 --> 34:33.738
It's purely introductory, that's it.

34:33.821 --> 34:37.366
Any questions you have
that aren't answered in the pamphlet,

34:37.450 --> 34:41.037
well, I will make my staff available
for private hearings

34:41.829 --> 34:46.250
every business day
between now and the filing deadline.

34:52.840 --> 34:53.925
What do you think?

34:54.008 --> 34:56.844
Maybe a poor choice of words
here and there.

34:57.345 --> 34:58.304
Here and there?

34:59.388 --> 35:00.765
-Camille?
-Yeah.

35:00.848 --> 35:03.309
-We need to get back to the office.
-Mr. Feinberg?

35:03.810 --> 35:06.145
-Mr. Feinberg, give me a minute, please?
-Yeah?

35:07.146 --> 35:09.273
I'm Frank Donato. I'm sorry to bother you.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.733
No, not at all. Not at all.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.318
Hi, Ken Feinberg.

35:12.985 --> 35:14.821
What happened there? Did you break that?

35:14.904 --> 35:16.614
My son, Andy, broke his last year.

35:16.697 --> 35:17.698
Rugby injury.

35:19.742 --> 35:20.785
South Tower.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.247
Yeah, I'm just curious
about this number.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.206
Sure.

35:25.289 --> 35:28.459
Jeez. Thank you for… for your courage.

35:28.543 --> 35:32.046
My brother, too, Nick. Nicholas.
Same line of company.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.090
Ah. Is he here?

35:38.261 --> 35:39.095
Well…

35:40.054 --> 35:41.139
Gosh, I'm sorry.

35:41.639 --> 35:45.143
Yeah. I, uh, I lost track of him
after the first one fell,

35:45.226 --> 35:47.687
and the captain says
he went back in to help.

35:48.396 --> 35:49.313
Well, that…

35:50.064 --> 35:51.440
That takes a hero.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.651
Yeah. Except there wasn't any use.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.697
I mean, the engineers, they knew
the second one was coming down.

35:57.780 --> 36:01.701
They told PD to call out evacs,
but our radios, they're garbage.

36:02.326 --> 36:06.497
They hardly work in high-rise buildings,
if you believe that, in New York City.

36:06.581 --> 36:09.375
Look, we've been filing
the same damn reports for years,

36:09.458 --> 36:11.752
and you can guess
where they tell us to shove 'em.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.672
That's why things went so sideways
like they did, negligence,

36:14.755 --> 36:16.215
top-down, cheap, fucking…

36:18.843 --> 36:20.303
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

36:20.803 --> 36:24.891
When you file your report, whatever it is
that you do at the end of this,

36:24.974 --> 36:27.852
I want Nicky's story in it,
to make sure they change things,

36:27.935 --> 36:30.730
so that it don't ever happen
this way again. Can you do that?

36:30.813 --> 36:32.565
-Well--
-Can you promise me?

36:32.648 --> 36:35.568
-We can certainly look into--
-Not just talk.

36:36.068 --> 36:37.403
I want it to change.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.197
That's why I'm here.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.157
-Why I'm still here.
-I understand.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.160
-Believe that.
-Can you hold? Camille.

36:44.243 --> 36:45.661
Can you come over here?

36:47.205 --> 36:50.124
-Frank, this is Camille Biros.
-Hi.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.751
She's my deputy administrator.

36:51.834 --> 36:54.712
And if you talk to her,
she can explain the whole process.

36:54.795 --> 36:57.423
No, I don't need to hear anything else.
I just…

36:58.132 --> 37:00.676
I need you to give me your word
on this thing.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.053
Ken.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.180
Then me and my wife,

37:04.263 --> 37:07.558
Nicky's widow, our whole family,
we'll sign up for your fund, no problem.

37:09.143 --> 37:12.355
Yeah. Well, we're certainly
going to take a look at it.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.989
Website at the bottom.
First meeting tomorrow.

37:22.531 --> 37:24.575
There you go, folks.
First meeting tomorrow.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.744
-Yeah.
-First meeting. Would you like one?

37:29.538 --> 37:32.041
There you go.
First meeting is tomorrow, if you'd like.

37:32.124 --> 37:35.628
So Fix The Fund. Here you are.
Take a few of these, hand them out.

37:35.711 --> 37:37.255
We need to talk about this.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.006
Yeah, not now though.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.675
Website on the bottom, okay?

37:41.175 --> 37:42.885
-Hello.
-Oh, hi. How are you?

37:42.969 --> 37:45.596
Hey, I wanna thank you
for your help back there.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.056
-Oh.
-I gotta tell you, I was…

37:47.139 --> 37:49.809
Here you are. Website at the bottom.
First meeting is tomorrow.

37:49.892 --> 37:52.478
…a little worried when you stood up.
I'm glad you did.

37:52.561 --> 37:55.439
Oh, well, I believe in civility,
Mr. Feinberg.

37:55.523 --> 37:56.941
-Yeah.
-Charles Wolf.

37:57.024 --> 37:58.901
And you'll be seeing a lot of me.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.528
Oh, good to know. And it's Ken.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.364
I think you'll find
that I'm one of your harshest critics.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.700
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.493
Well, my wife died that day,

38:07.994 --> 38:10.496
and everything about this formula
offends me.

38:10.579 --> 38:11.580
Oh.

38:11.664 --> 38:14.542
Here you go. Take one of those.
And I'll give you one too.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.711
I've set up a page on the World Wide Web.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.129
Website's there at the bottom.

38:18.212 --> 38:20.965
It's called Fix The Fund.
And here you go. Fix The Fund.

38:21.507 --> 38:25.970
There you go. There's two there.
And, um, if you'd like to visit it

38:26.053 --> 38:28.848
and come to our meeting,
we have the first meeting, uh, tomorrow…

38:28.931 --> 38:30.182
Here you go. Take that please.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.268
And we'd… I'd love it if you would attend.

38:32.351 --> 38:33.686
Also, I have this for you.

38:33.769 --> 38:36.689
This is something…
And there are a number of notes

38:36.772 --> 38:39.734
and corrections and things.
It's important you address those.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.444
Here you are. Take these, folks.

38:41.527 --> 38:44.989
Take a look at the website on the bottom.
There's a couple of them there for you.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.741
-Nice to meet you.
-All right.

38:46.824 --> 38:47.950
Fix The Fund.

38:48.451 --> 38:51.287
-We're not gonna rewrite the formula.
-They don't trust us.

38:51.370 --> 38:53.289
They don't understand
this is for their own good.

38:53.372 --> 38:56.584
The airlines would bury them in litigation
until they had nothing left.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.377
You think I don't know that?

38:58.878 --> 39:01.797
This is different.
Didn't you feel it in there?

39:01.881 --> 39:04.133
Our other cases like this,
Agent Orange, Asbestos,

39:04.216 --> 39:06.761
those were settled after years in court.
People had moved on.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.387
These people aren't there yet.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.639
Camille, they're emotional right now.

39:10.723 --> 39:13.184
We need to be objective toward them.
That's all.

39:13.267 --> 39:15.478
-Hey, that's for you, Feinberg!

39:17.813 --> 39:18.939
Fuck you!

39:20.775 --> 39:21.650
What the…

40:15.246 --> 40:16.789
Families got in last night.

40:16.872 --> 40:20.543
Cleary Gottlieb helped us out
with the immigration status and the INS,

40:20.626 --> 40:22.586
so we'll use their conference room.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.634
Coming?

40:38.144 --> 40:42.690
Sorry, it's just, you know,
small spaces these days, and heights.

40:43.607 --> 40:45.401
I'll be fine. It's…

40:51.157 --> 40:54.243
I know you've been informed,
but I wanna reassure you

40:54.326 --> 40:56.704
that your citizenship
or your immigration status

40:56.787 --> 41:00.082
will have absolutely no effect
on our process here today.

41:00.166 --> 41:03.085
Everything you tell us
will be kept strictly confidential.

41:34.450 --> 41:38.037
We're all looking at your tables
and not liking what we're seeing.

41:38.537 --> 41:41.040
You're only factoring in
yearly compensation.

41:41.123 --> 41:44.251
What about commissions, bonuses?
We represent high-worth individuals.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.421
That kind of income comes and goes.
There's no guarantees with that.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.341
-That's why we stick to the salaries.
-That's unacceptable.

41:50.424 --> 41:53.010
You'll also have to strike this rule
deducting life insurance.

41:53.093 --> 41:54.595
This is not a negotiation here--

41:54.678 --> 41:57.431
Why should our clients' families
be penalized for planning well?

41:57.515 --> 41:58.474
Come on.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.185
-No one's being penalized.

42:01.268 --> 42:02.353
Thank you, Lee.

42:02.436 --> 42:05.231
We're just being paid off
to keep our clients out of court.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.358
That's an oversimplification.

42:07.441 --> 42:09.568
That's the purpose of the fund, Ken.

42:09.652 --> 42:12.071
I was in the room, too, remember?

42:13.739 --> 42:16.450
I do wanna point out that the law requires

42:16.534 --> 42:19.161
we base awards on income,

42:19.245 --> 42:22.831
but we've decided on a floor payout

42:23.457 --> 42:27.044
for all lost lives of $200,000.

42:46.730 --> 42:50.693
Now, mind you, that's just a minimum.

42:50.776 --> 42:54.655
Is that split between more people,
or just the families here?

42:55.155 --> 42:58.409
Uh, no, it's not a split at all.
It's per decedent.

43:09.670 --> 43:13.674
This is a report by an economist,
a distinguished one,

43:14.717 --> 43:17.636
predicting future compensation
growth rates for our clients.

43:18.220 --> 43:20.598
We suggest you use
those numbers as a baseline.

43:21.390 --> 43:23.475
We're here as friends, Ken.

43:23.559 --> 43:26.979
Your formula may be enough
for waitresses at Windows on the World,

43:27.062 --> 43:29.481
but our clients expect a little more.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.110
And if they can't get it from the fund,

43:33.944 --> 43:36.363
they'll seek that remuneration elsewhere.

43:39.491 --> 43:40.659
That bad?

43:41.410 --> 43:44.121
Pack of wolves out for blood.

43:44.872 --> 43:45.748
Yours?

43:45.831 --> 43:46.790
Grateful.

43:59.553 --> 44:01.889
-Are they all here to meet with the staff?
-Yeah.

44:01.972 --> 44:05.643
Priya and the others are helping out.
I'm meeting with as many as I can myself.

44:05.726 --> 44:07.394
Oh good, good. Very good.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.605
Most would rather meet with you, you know.

44:09.688 --> 44:11.940
They lost loved ones
that are gone forever,

44:12.024 --> 44:15.444
and nothing you do will fill that hole.

44:16.236 --> 44:19.114
You'll feel cold and cruel at times

44:19.198 --> 44:21.533
because you can't make them happy, but…

44:23.911 --> 44:24.912
…that's the job.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.208
So just try to remember
why you're doing it.

44:38.175 --> 44:40.969
I… I hope this is all right.

44:41.637 --> 44:45.808
The stenographer will be here
just to keep a record of our conversation.

44:45.891 --> 44:46.725
Sure.

44:48.018 --> 44:49.770
Is… Why don't you, um…

44:50.646 --> 44:53.315
Why don't you tell me
about your loved one,

44:53.941 --> 44:54.900
Ann-Marie?

44:55.526 --> 44:59.446
Uh, Page 14, um, Part 2K

44:59.530 --> 45:02.074
talks about supporting documents
I should enclose,

45:02.157 --> 45:04.535
like financial stuff, so I…

45:04.618 --> 45:07.579
I dug up
all his files here,

45:09.123 --> 45:10.624
what I could find.

45:11.417 --> 45:13.460
Honestly, I don't know where to start.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.587
Let's see if we can make sense of it.

45:18.257 --> 45:21.885
It asks here if she was suffering
from any medical disabilities.

45:22.386 --> 45:25.431
What does that mean? If she was,
you gonna cut the amount of money?

45:25.514 --> 45:28.100
-Well, not necessarily.
-Bullshit you guys are pulling.

45:28.183 --> 45:30.602
This is like going
to an insurance company.

45:31.103 --> 45:33.355
Gotta watch your back
with every thing you say with them,

45:33.439 --> 45:34.815
and it's the same thing here.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.402
My kids need money for the both of us.

45:39.361 --> 45:41.071
They won't have anybody left.

45:47.286 --> 45:49.997
There's no way to cut me a check
before the official deadline?

45:50.497 --> 45:53.751
That morning,
she was scheduled for a different flight,

45:53.834 --> 45:56.086
but another girl called in sick,

45:56.170 --> 45:59.381
and so, it was my sister.

46:01.675 --> 46:03.051
Uh…

46:03.135 --> 46:05.763
And she's the one
who called the tower on the radio.

46:08.390 --> 46:09.683
Air Traffic Control,

46:11.059 --> 46:12.436
they played it for me.

46:14.104 --> 46:16.899
She must have been so scared.

46:20.569 --> 46:22.029
She sounded so calm.

46:23.906 --> 46:27.201
So the elevators came,
and everybody piled on,

46:29.244 --> 46:31.580
but there wasn't enough room,
and so Greg said,

46:31.663 --> 46:35.000
"That's okay, everyone. You go ahead."

46:38.045 --> 46:41.965
There were two women who weren't ready,
and so he said, "I'll wait with them."

46:44.843 --> 46:48.472
And so everyone else got out,
and another elevator never came.

46:51.600 --> 46:52.893
And I know that part of the story

46:52.976 --> 46:55.479
because he called me
when they were trapped there

46:55.562 --> 46:59.483
to say that he loved me

47:00.609 --> 47:01.610
and the children.

47:02.778 --> 47:03.779
He said…

47:08.534 --> 47:10.118
He told me that he was trapped,

47:11.703 --> 47:13.831
and he was having difficulty breathing.

47:13.914 --> 47:16.166
I could hear the women
screaming in the background

47:16.250 --> 47:17.751
that they didn't wanna die.

47:21.004 --> 47:24.591
And just then he heard
an announcement. They were…

47:25.300 --> 47:26.260
I heard it too.

47:26.343 --> 47:30.639
They were announcing on the loudspeakers,
"Please evacuate the building."

47:34.351 --> 47:35.602
And Greg was…

47:37.813 --> 47:40.190
He always had a sense of humor. And he…

47:40.983 --> 47:44.027
While he was talking to me,
he actually started to laugh.

47:44.653 --> 47:46.613
He was joking to me saying that,

47:47.906 --> 47:50.492
"I think I know
I have to get out of the building."

47:51.493 --> 47:53.495
And he was laughing so hard,

47:53.579 --> 47:55.873
until he said, "I have to go now

47:57.040 --> 48:00.961
because I can't talk anymore,
because I'm having trouble with air."

48:28.780 --> 48:31.366
I know
I'm not officially his next of kin.

48:33.952 --> 48:35.537
We never made it to Vermont.

48:37.998 --> 48:39.708
And Tom's parents don't, uh…

48:42.461 --> 48:44.963
Well, they're a pretty traditional
military family.

48:47.007 --> 48:48.634
They pretend I don't exist.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.305
But I'm the one he called,

48:54.514 --> 48:55.515
before the end,

48:56.058 --> 48:57.059
not them.

49:02.814 --> 49:03.899
Machine picked up.

49:05.817 --> 49:06.944
I wasn't home.

49:10.530 --> 49:12.491
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.

49:13.116 --> 49:14.159
I know the rules.

49:15.911 --> 49:18.246
State law says
we were nothing to each other.

49:21.917 --> 49:23.752
But I'd like you to hear his voice.

49:27.464 --> 49:28.924
-Hi, hon.

49:29.007 --> 49:31.927
By now I guess you've heard
about the mess in New York.

49:32.010 --> 49:33.595
Um…

49:33.679 --> 49:37.724
Well, a plane just hit here, too,
on the western side of the building.

49:38.266 --> 49:40.852
-It went right through the E and D rings.
-Okay, that's…

49:40.936 --> 49:42.062
Could you turn that off?

49:42.145 --> 49:44.272
I don't know
if they're showing it on the news.

49:44.356 --> 49:45.399
That's enough.

49:45.899 --> 49:47.025
I love you.

49:47.109 --> 49:49.152
That's enough. I don't wanna listen.

49:52.489 --> 49:55.200
He was a civilian contractor
at the Pentagon.

49:55.283 --> 49:57.911
They were gonna have a civil union,
but Tom's parents…

49:58.829 --> 50:01.873
-They won't even take Graham's calls.
-And what did you tell him?

50:01.957 --> 50:06.294
I told him that Virginia state law
has no protection for same-sex couples,

50:06.378 --> 50:08.797
and our rules are tied to state law.

50:08.880 --> 50:12.467
Well, that's it then.
I mean, our hands are tied.

50:13.260 --> 50:17.139
-We can't insert ourselves in--
-Why can't we make exceptions?

50:17.723 --> 50:19.016
There are others.

50:19.099 --> 50:21.601
Last week, a widow came in with cancer.

50:22.144 --> 50:25.981
She needs more than we can give her
by the rules, and she needs it expedited.

50:26.064 --> 50:28.817
Can't cherry pick one case over another.

50:28.900 --> 50:31.820
We can't write new rules
for every claimant.

50:31.903 --> 50:33.655
-I know this is personal to you--

50:33.739 --> 50:36.033
You weren't in those rooms, okay?

50:36.116 --> 50:39.077
-You didn't listen to them.
-We're not therapists.

50:41.747 --> 50:43.415
Am I right? It's not our job.

50:44.666 --> 50:45.500
I…

50:46.084 --> 50:48.754
It's not like I don't care.
Of course I care.

50:49.546 --> 50:51.757
How could you not care?
That's why we're here.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.718
But I need to stay impartial
for this to work.

50:55.218 --> 50:58.764
We set rules for a reason.
We set deadlines for a reason.

50:58.847 --> 51:00.098
That's the job.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.142
Camille, go on, tell her.

51:10.609 --> 51:11.610
Priya.

51:13.945 --> 51:15.155
-Hey.

51:16.281 --> 51:17.491
-Hey.
-You okay?

51:18.158 --> 51:19.159
Yeah, just…

51:19.659 --> 51:22.746
He thinks
I'm taking it too personally.

51:22.829 --> 51:24.581
Come on, that is out of line.

51:26.124 --> 51:27.125
No.

51:27.709 --> 51:29.211
No, he's right, you know.

51:30.212 --> 51:32.005
It is personal for me. I…

51:34.925 --> 51:38.386
If I can't be objective,
then maybe I shouldn't be here.

51:41.848 --> 51:45.060
I just…
I think I just need some air. Yeah.

51:45.143 --> 51:46.269
-All right.

51:46.353 --> 51:47.646
-Hey.
-Yeah.

51:47.729 --> 51:48.730
See you tomorrow?

51:49.231 --> 51:50.816
Yeah.

52:09.251 --> 52:10.252
Oh.

52:11.419 --> 52:12.671
-Gloria.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.298
Call the restaurant

52:15.841 --> 52:19.678
and see if Dede and the kids
are still eating dinner, would ya, please?

52:20.303 --> 52:22.139
They called an hour ago, Ken.

52:22.222 --> 52:23.723
The kids had trains to catch.

52:23.807 --> 52:26.601
Oh, they said to tell you, though,
that they understand.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.145
Whoa.

52:28.979 --> 52:29.855
All right.

52:49.541 --> 52:52.169
I understand that, and I'm sorry,

52:52.252 --> 52:54.171
but our staff already went home.

52:54.671 --> 52:57.757
Come back tomorrow,
I'll make sure that we get you into see…

52:58.466 --> 53:00.218
Is there a problem, Gloria?

53:01.511 --> 53:03.805
Oh, Mr. Donato, right?

53:03.889 --> 53:07.225
Yeah, we… we had an appointment,
but we hit traffic, so we're late.

53:07.976 --> 53:09.186
There's no one here.

53:09.686 --> 53:11.146
The whole staff is gone.

53:12.189 --> 53:14.774
Oh, well, I'll take this one.

53:15.275 --> 53:17.277
-Come on into my office.
-Not me,

53:18.528 --> 53:19.362
them.

53:24.492 --> 53:25.702
So, uh…

53:27.204 --> 53:30.040
Frank told me about your husband.

53:30.624 --> 53:31.958
-Nick.
-Yeah.

53:32.626 --> 53:34.169
Yeah, Frank thinks this is a scam.

53:35.045 --> 53:38.298
That it's, like, blood money
to cover up mistakes.

53:38.381 --> 53:41.551
Well, at least, you're open-minded.

53:41.635 --> 53:45.847
I just think that the boys might want
their dad's story told in your report,

53:46.348 --> 53:47.641
if that's a thing.

53:47.724 --> 53:49.643
Hmm, sure. Sure.

53:52.812 --> 53:55.190
Are you gonna take notes or somethin'?

53:57.984 --> 53:59.319
Ah, right.

53:59.861 --> 54:00.737
Uh…

54:01.279 --> 54:05.909
Actually, our stenographer
already went home for the day.

54:05.992 --> 54:06.993
Oh.

54:08.995 --> 54:09.955
Can't you type?

54:20.048 --> 54:21.341
Wha-- Uh…

54:21.424 --> 54:23.635
Hold on a minute here. There we go.

54:23.718 --> 54:24.886
Uh…

54:25.470 --> 54:26.471
Why don't we…

54:27.889 --> 54:29.766
uh, start with your name?

54:29.849 --> 54:31.935
Okay. Karen Donato.

54:33.019 --> 54:34.437
My husband, Nick…

54:36.022 --> 54:38.441
Nicholas Donato,
was a New York City firefighter.

54:38.942 --> 54:42.112
Ladder 179 out of Staten Island.

54:42.737 --> 54:43.571
Yeah.

54:53.206 --> 54:54.082
Do you…

54:54.582 --> 54:55.959
Tell me more about him.

54:58.295 --> 55:01.506
Do you have like a list of questions
you could ask me maybe?

55:03.049 --> 55:08.680
Uh, well, actually I… I don't…
I don't usually do this part myself.

55:08.763 --> 55:12.183
Yeah, I just… It's harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

55:12.267 --> 55:13.643
Yeah, I understand.

55:13.727 --> 55:16.021
Uh, well, if you're uncomfortable--

55:16.104 --> 55:19.316
My husband of eight years,
and I can't even think of anything to say.

55:20.942 --> 55:25.447
Well, uh, he must have been a good…
a good dad.

55:26.781 --> 55:27.866
Yeah.

55:27.949 --> 55:29.743
Oh God, he was a great dad.

55:30.243 --> 55:32.412
He would come home every night after work,

55:32.912 --> 55:34.831
he'd throw the ball with Nicky Jr.,

55:34.914 --> 55:37.000
he would read Patty a book.

55:37.083 --> 55:39.419
He didn't even mind
when Tyler made number two.

55:39.502 --> 55:42.505
-He said he liked changing diapers.
-Well, that's a hero.

55:46.217 --> 55:47.218
Yeah.

55:52.223 --> 55:53.475
He was my whole world.

55:57.771 --> 55:59.564
-Can I have a tissue, please?
-Yeah.

56:04.569 --> 56:05.570
Here we go.

56:05.653 --> 56:06.654
Thank you.

56:08.698 --> 56:12.535
You know, everybody
keeps telling me to move on.

56:13.745 --> 56:15.413
I don't know how to do that.

56:17.415 --> 56:20.460
-I'm never gonna get over him.
-Well, it's still very soon.

56:20.543 --> 56:21.628
No, never.

56:23.171 --> 56:25.590
-I'm really sorry.
-No, no, no.

56:25.673 --> 56:27.425
That's all right. Look, um,

56:27.509 --> 56:31.304
I just want you to know there's
no pressure to sign on to the fund today.

56:31.388 --> 56:32.889
Your status as a single mother--

56:32.972 --> 56:34.974
No, I'm not gonna take any money.

56:35.058 --> 56:36.226
Not now, no, but--

56:36.309 --> 56:39.562
No, there's no money in the world
that's good enough for Nick.

56:39.646 --> 56:42.315
-I didn't mean--
-You know, I had him in my life.

56:43.108 --> 56:44.401
We had so many…

56:47.779 --> 56:49.489
dreams and plans…

56:52.033 --> 56:54.035
…and things we were gonna do.

56:55.829 --> 56:58.498
And then he was just gone.
He was gone.

57:00.166 --> 57:03.253
He didn't even eat breakfast.
He was just gone.

57:06.756 --> 57:08.591
And now you're trying to give me money,

57:08.675 --> 57:10.260
Frank wants me to make a stink,

57:10.343 --> 57:13.680
there's lawyers calling me
and telling me to sue everybody,

57:13.763 --> 57:16.558
and the phone just won't stop ringing.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.185
But it's never the phone call I want.

57:19.269 --> 57:22.147
It's never the call saying
that they found his body.

57:22.730 --> 57:24.482
That they're gonna bring him home.

57:24.983 --> 57:26.192
And no offense,

57:27.068 --> 57:28.319
I just want you,

57:28.403 --> 57:31.781
I want all of you
to please stop calling me.

57:31.865 --> 57:33.533
Please leave me alone.

57:37.036 --> 57:38.037
I'm sorry.

57:39.831 --> 57:41.374
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

58:14.782 --> 58:15.783
Kenny?

58:19.204 --> 58:20.538
I met a widow today.

58:22.540 --> 58:23.625
Three kids.

58:25.251 --> 58:26.294
Can you imagine?

58:31.799 --> 58:32.800
No.

58:35.512 --> 58:37.055
I didn't know what to say.

58:40.934 --> 58:43.311
Well, sometimes,
there isn't anything.

58:59.994 --> 59:02.413
-That one's blocked.

59:02.956 --> 59:04.832
Anyway, it's hard to see.

59:06.709 --> 59:08.294
I'll… I'll call when I get out.

59:08.378 --> 59:10.964
People are collapsing from the smoke.

59:11.047 --> 59:13.341
Bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Sorry. Sorr--

59:16.886 --> 59:18.471
-Hi, hon.

59:19.264 --> 59:21.432
By now I guess you've heard about
the mess in New York.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.434
-Um…

59:23.935 --> 59:28.439
Well, a plane just hit here, too,
on the western side of the building.

59:56.217 --> 59:58.094
This is not
the preferred option

59:58.177 --> 1:00:00.722
of the president of the United States,
or any member of this body.

1:00:00.805 --> 1:00:02.515
This is the last option.

1:00:03.349 --> 1:00:04.767
We can make the case

1:00:06.060 --> 1:00:08.688
that it is obvious
that Saddam Hussein continues

1:00:08.771 --> 1:00:10.982
this buildup of weapons
of mass destruction,

1:00:11.065 --> 1:00:13.651
and his desire and effort even in…

1:00:13.735 --> 1:00:15.653
Up to and including nuclear weapons.

1:00:16.362 --> 1:00:19.490
But we are not the ones
who are forcing this issue.

1:00:19.574 --> 1:00:22.368
The president and his resolution
did not force the issue.

1:00:22.452 --> 1:00:25.288
It is Saddam Hussein
who is forcing this issue.

1:00:25.371 --> 1:00:26.331
And we will…

1:00:30.668 --> 1:00:32.503
Final stop
on this express train,

1:00:32.587 --> 1:00:34.005
New York Penn Station.

1:00:34.088 --> 1:00:36.215
Next stop, New York Penn Station.

1:01:02.825 --> 1:01:07.413
Well, I… I think the most
important thing is that we stand united.

1:01:07.914 --> 1:01:12.418
Because the only way
that they're going to respond to you

1:01:12.502 --> 1:01:14.712
is if they know you're speaking as one.

1:01:14.796 --> 1:01:16.881
-Excuse me for a moment.
-Of course.

1:01:21.803 --> 1:01:23.304
You came. Thank you.

1:01:23.805 --> 1:01:25.139
We start in a few minutes.

1:01:25.682 --> 1:01:26.891
An enemy in our midst.

1:01:26.974 --> 1:01:30.019
-Ah, hi. Priya Khundi.
-Yes, I remember.

1:01:30.895 --> 1:01:35.274
Did Mr. Feinberg send you here
to spy on us or to listen?

1:01:36.192 --> 1:01:38.945
-Actually, he doesn't know I came.
-Ah.

1:01:39.612 --> 1:01:42.532
Well, it's easier for him
if we just remain numbers, right?

1:01:42.615 --> 1:01:43.741
More manageable?

1:01:44.659 --> 1:01:46.619
He's right, it is.

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:48.663
Hmm, I understand. Yeah. Yeah.

1:01:49.831 --> 1:01:51.416
-But you came.

1:01:51.999 --> 1:01:54.752
-Yeah, um, I've been following your blog.
-Mm-hmm.

1:01:54.836 --> 1:01:58.840
Your wife, Katherine,
she had a job at Kyle and MacAllan.

1:01:59.507 --> 1:02:00.508
Yes. Yeah.

1:02:01.008 --> 1:02:04.053
That, um, was her dream job.

1:02:05.596 --> 1:02:07.432
Well, it would have been mine too.

1:02:07.974 --> 1:02:09.851
I… I was, uh…

1:02:11.060 --> 1:02:12.478
I was gonna start that week.

1:02:13.604 --> 1:02:14.605
Oh my.

1:02:17.525 --> 1:02:19.652
Well, I'm glad that you…

1:02:20.236 --> 1:02:21.237
Yeah.

1:02:23.281 --> 1:02:24.657
So can I ask you then?

1:02:28.035 --> 1:02:32.457
What would your life be worth
on your boss's spreadsheet?

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:37.336
I'm not married,
so, um, less than Katherine's.

1:02:37.879 --> 1:02:39.464
And do you think that's fair?

1:02:41.424 --> 1:02:42.592
No.

1:02:42.675 --> 1:02:43.885
But your boss does?

1:02:44.594 --> 1:02:46.804
He doesn't think fair exists.

1:02:47.889 --> 1:02:48.890
Do you?

1:02:49.515 --> 1:02:51.976
Honestly, I don't know.

1:02:53.770 --> 1:02:56.063
But I did come here to listen.

1:03:08.409 --> 1:03:10.495
This is the latest, huh? This is…

1:03:10.578 --> 1:03:14.123
You're sure this is the latest?
These totals are accurate?

1:03:14.207 --> 1:03:15.875
Technically, we rounded up.

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:18.169
Uh, it's all right, it's okay.

1:03:18.669 --> 1:03:21.297
We're 12 months out.
That's an eternity. It's like I say,

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:24.383
people will wait for a deadline.
They're just avoiding it for now.

1:03:24.467 --> 1:03:27.804
They're not avoiding it.
They're just avoiding us.

1:03:28.304 --> 1:03:29.597
I mean, look at this.

1:03:30.473 --> 1:03:33.017
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Fix The Fund. I remember, yeah.

1:03:33.100 --> 1:03:35.478
This is my pal.
This is my buddy from the town hall.

1:03:35.561 --> 1:03:40.149
His web page is receiving more than
twice the visits ours does every day.

1:03:40.233 --> 1:03:43.152
He's got a mailing list
of almost 7,000 names.

1:03:43.236 --> 1:03:44.612
So does the phone book.

1:03:45.238 --> 1:03:46.155
I went to see him.

1:03:46.989 --> 1:03:48.491
I told her it was okay to go.

1:03:48.574 --> 1:03:49.826
Look, he's a leader.

1:03:49.909 --> 1:03:51.077
He's a gadfly.

1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:53.120
He's earning people's trust.

1:03:53.204 --> 1:03:57.250
Every income level, first responders…
That's what we should be doing.

1:03:57.333 --> 1:03:59.961
If he says so, all of them will sue.

1:04:02.547 --> 1:04:03.965
What's he asking for?

1:04:04.048 --> 1:04:05.800
You should ask him yourself.

1:04:23.442 --> 1:04:24.443
Charles.

1:04:25.945 --> 1:04:26.863
Mr. Feinberg.

1:04:27.446 --> 1:04:30.157
I'm sorry they left you in here
with the music running.

1:04:30.241 --> 1:04:31.492
-Oh.
-Uh…

1:04:31.576 --> 1:04:33.494
-Soothes the soul.
-Yeah.

1:04:34.036 --> 1:04:37.832
Yeah, this was the Lincoln Center cast,
if I'm not mistaken.

1:04:37.915 --> 1:04:40.751
Bartoli was otherworldly.

1:04:41.502 --> 1:04:44.714
Wow, you're an opera fan.
I was on the board that year.

1:04:44.797 --> 1:04:46.799
My wife, Katherine, she was, uh…

1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:50.344
She sang soprano
in an amateur touring choir.

1:04:50.428 --> 1:04:52.138
I sing tenor. That's how we met.

1:04:52.638 --> 1:04:54.974
Well, she must have had a lovely voice.

1:04:57.226 --> 1:04:58.060
Yep.

1:05:00.646 --> 1:05:02.815
Would that help her fit into your formula?

1:05:04.984 --> 1:05:06.485
Do you read my website?

1:05:06.569 --> 1:05:09.947
I will confess I don't,
because I'm not a computer guy.

1:05:10.031 --> 1:05:12.241
-Ah.
-My staff handles all that,

1:05:12.325 --> 1:05:16.203
and they tell me
you're a very reasonable man.

1:05:16.287 --> 1:05:17.455
And as I understand it,

1:05:17.538 --> 1:05:19.749
you've taken on somewhat
of a leadership role

1:05:20.249 --> 1:05:22.501
uh, amongst the people that we serve.

1:05:22.585 --> 1:05:26.297
-Mm-hmm.
-That's nice. Good. Good.

1:05:27.048 --> 1:05:31.010
-Uh, why don't we talk?
-That's why I'm here.

1:05:33.846 --> 1:05:35.306
Tell me what you want.

1:05:36.182 --> 1:05:38.851
Because we could make some adjustments.

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:42.271
We could, uh, you know,
raise the baselines.

1:05:43.230 --> 1:05:45.566
So you think this is about the money?

1:05:46.609 --> 1:05:47.693
Hmm, of course, yeah.

1:05:48.319 --> 1:05:49.487
That it's greed?

1:05:49.570 --> 1:05:53.157
No. No, no, no, no. Not greed.

1:05:53.240 --> 1:05:55.117
Money, yes. Greed, no.

1:05:55.618 --> 1:05:58.329
Money puts food on people's tables

1:05:58.412 --> 1:06:00.331
and it puts roofs over people's heads.

1:06:00.414 --> 1:06:02.750
There's nothing dirty
or demeaning about it,

1:06:02.833 --> 1:06:07.421
but let's not pretend
like it doesn't matter. It does.

1:06:07.505 --> 1:06:08.923
It helps people move on.

1:06:10.841 --> 1:06:11.884
Who?

1:06:13.594 --> 1:06:16.305
-What do you mean who?
-Do you know any of our names?

1:06:17.056 --> 1:06:19.058
Have you met any of us yourself?

1:06:19.141 --> 1:06:21.268
As a matter of fact, I have, yeah.

1:06:21.352 --> 1:06:22.353
Huh.

1:06:23.729 --> 1:06:24.981
And what were they worth?

1:06:25.690 --> 1:06:26.565
Oh.

1:06:26.649 --> 1:06:28.901
Well, now…
Now you're talking about numbers,

1:06:28.985 --> 1:06:30.945
and you know, pretending--

1:06:31.028 --> 1:06:32.029
Throw it out.

1:06:32.530 --> 1:06:34.407
Throw what out? Throw what out?

1:06:34.907 --> 1:06:37.576
-Throw out your formula.
-I can't. I can't.

1:06:37.660 --> 1:06:39.745
We need to have something rational.

1:06:39.829 --> 1:06:42.373
I got it. I understand. I got it.

1:06:42.456 --> 1:06:46.002
But my wife is not a statistic.

1:06:46.085 --> 1:06:49.880
No, certainly not,
but we do have to go by a set of rules.

1:06:49.964 --> 1:06:53.092
Okay. Will your rules help Graham Morris?

1:06:53.926 --> 1:06:57.680
Graham Morris. His partner died
two weeks before their civil ceremony,

1:06:57.763 --> 1:07:00.433
but your fund would give
his full claim to his parents

1:07:00.516 --> 1:07:01.976
who condemned his lifestyle.

1:07:02.059 --> 1:07:04.270
-I recall him.
-They were estranged.

1:07:04.353 --> 1:07:07.189
Completely estranged, Mr. Feinberg.
Is that fair?

1:07:07.690 --> 1:07:09.358
We're just the administrators on that.

1:07:09.442 --> 1:07:11.360
Let's go to the section
of your rules

1:07:11.444 --> 1:07:14.864
that limits injuries
to only those that occurred right away.

1:07:15.364 --> 1:07:17.408
We have cleanup workers
who come to our meetings.

1:07:17.491 --> 1:07:19.744
-They have polyps from asbestos.
-I think the thing--

1:07:19.827 --> 1:07:22.830
They were on that site for weeks,
for weeks, breathing in that crap.

1:07:22.913 --> 1:07:24.623
-Hmm.
-But according to your rules,

1:07:24.707 --> 1:07:27.877
unless they got to that site
within three days of the attack--

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:31.047
Ah, that's because
we have to draw the line somewhere.

1:07:31.130 --> 1:07:35.176
If we award every worker
who was injured on that site,

1:07:35.259 --> 1:07:38.721
I mean, where does it end? You understand?

1:07:38.804 --> 1:07:41.766
I don't know, you tell me.
That's up to you.

1:07:43.309 --> 1:07:46.896
The law gives you broad discretion
as special master, does it not?

1:07:46.979 --> 1:07:48.731
-Yes, it does.
-Okay.

1:07:48.814 --> 1:07:51.567
And responsibilities.
Responsibilities to the taxpayers,

1:07:51.650 --> 1:07:52.985
to objectivity.

1:07:53.069 --> 1:07:57.364
I… I can't bend the rules
for every case that doesn't fit the mold.

1:07:57.448 --> 1:07:58.449
Why not?

1:07:59.366 --> 1:08:00.284
Congress did.

1:08:02.203 --> 1:08:03.329
You know they did.

1:08:04.163 --> 1:08:07.750
When the law said that we could sue
two airlines out of business,

1:08:07.833 --> 1:08:10.503
Congress rewrote that law like that,

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:12.046
in a day.

1:08:12.546 --> 1:08:13.380
Why?

1:08:13.923 --> 1:08:16.425
Because the big corporations
asked them to.

1:08:17.134 --> 1:08:21.305
But when 7,000 citizens come to you
and they ask you for respect

1:08:21.889 --> 1:08:24.892
and ask not to be treated
like some numbers on a spreadsheet,

1:08:24.975 --> 1:08:27.394
you act like that law
came down from Sinai.

1:08:28.020 --> 1:08:30.856
Please, Mr. Feinberg, don't. Don't. Don't.

1:08:30.940 --> 1:08:33.317
Don't tell me
you can't give us what we want.

1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:36.403
Just tell us
that we are not the top priority.

1:08:36.487 --> 1:08:37.488
Admit that,

1:08:38.447 --> 1:08:39.448
to yourself.

1:08:48.249 --> 1:08:49.250
Over here.

1:08:57.508 --> 1:08:59.385
-Hello?
-Is this Kenneth Feinberg?

1:08:59.885 --> 1:09:02.346
-Come here. Come here. Goddamn it.

1:09:02.888 --> 1:09:05.474
-Hello?
-Yeah, hi. Is this Kenneth Feinberg?

1:09:05.558 --> 1:09:06.851
Yes. Who's this?

1:09:06.934 --> 1:09:08.352
Bart Cuthbert, sir.

1:09:08.435 --> 1:09:09.812
Uh, we haven't met.

1:09:09.895 --> 1:09:11.730
I represent a claimant to your fund.

1:09:13.315 --> 1:09:14.692
Uh, this is a private line.

1:09:14.775 --> 1:09:16.777
Fund matters should go through my office.

1:09:16.861 --> 1:09:19.572
Right, the office, yes.
I spoke to someone at the office

1:09:19.655 --> 1:09:22.241
who said you took the meeting
on this case yourself.

1:09:22.741 --> 1:09:25.911
Uh, it's a young woman
by the name of Karen Donato.

1:09:26.453 --> 1:09:27.371
Widow of Nicholas?

1:09:27.454 --> 1:09:28.581
Yes, we spoke.

1:09:29.081 --> 1:09:34.378
He was a fireman with three sons
aged, um, eight, six, and four.

1:09:35.337 --> 1:09:37.131
-Look--
-What's this about?

1:09:37.214 --> 1:09:39.425
Well, it's an unusual scenario,
you see.

1:09:39.508 --> 1:09:42.386
Look, I don't mean
to cause you any trouble, Mr. Feinberg.

1:09:42.469 --> 1:09:44.805
Ken. Ken. No, go ahead. I'm used to it.

1:09:44.889 --> 1:09:48.184
All right. Well, Ken,
you see, my client, Melanie Vale,

1:09:48.267 --> 1:09:50.311
was Mr. Donato's mistress.

1:09:52.146 --> 1:09:55.774
-I'm not… I'm not sure I heard correctly.
-You heard correctly.

1:09:55.858 --> 1:09:58.861
Melanie Vale and Nick Donato
have two daughters of their own

1:09:58.944 --> 1:10:01.989
ages one and three
at the time of the attack.

1:10:02.072 --> 1:10:04.575
Uh, I have DNA results to prove paternity.

1:10:04.658 --> 1:10:06.952
My secretary
can fax them over to your office.

1:10:08.996 --> 1:10:10.039
Mr. Feinberg?

1:10:10.748 --> 1:10:11.582
Yes.

1:10:12.374 --> 1:10:16.754
Uh, all right. Well, I'm looking forward
to going over the papers.

1:10:17.755 --> 1:10:19.965
Like I said,
I'm not trying to make trouble here.

1:10:20.049 --> 1:10:23.427
I just want you to know that when
you cut that check for Mr. Donato's life,

1:10:23.510 --> 1:10:26.347
it needs to go to five children
instead of three.

1:10:28.098 --> 1:10:30.392
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

1:10:57.753 --> 1:10:59.505
-Hey, mister.

1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:08.180
So your office said that you had, uh,
some more questions about Nick.

1:11:08.264 --> 1:11:12.434
Yeah. Really it's more
just of a… a record-keeping thing.

1:11:12.518 --> 1:11:14.270
I told you we don't want the money.

1:11:14.353 --> 1:11:16.146
-Of course. Yeah.
-Okay.

1:11:16.230 --> 1:11:19.858
Uh… Oh, look.
There's your wedding pictures.

1:11:19.942 --> 1:11:21.068
No…

1:11:21.652 --> 1:11:23.654
Okay, this is just for show.

1:11:24.446 --> 1:11:26.448
-The real one was at City Hall.

1:11:26.532 --> 1:11:29.326
Before I was, you know,
as big as a circus tent.

1:11:30.869 --> 1:11:34.915
You know, I… I told him that I didn't need
anything all grand and fancy

1:11:34.999 --> 1:11:37.251
just to prove that he loved me, but, uh…

1:11:38.002 --> 1:11:40.796
You know, he worked doubles
for a whole year.

1:11:41.297 --> 1:11:44.925
He wouldn't take a nickel
from my family or anybody.

1:11:45.968 --> 1:11:48.095
Just so we could have
that picture on the wall.

1:11:49.305 --> 1:11:50.306
He was like that.

1:11:52.641 --> 1:11:56.812
And that, I'm assuming, Nicky Jr. there?

1:11:58.022 --> 1:11:59.231
Oh no.

1:11:59.315 --> 1:12:04.236
Uh, that was a girl.
We lost her. She was a preemie.

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:06.322
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

1:12:06.864 --> 1:12:07.781
Eden.

1:12:09.450 --> 1:12:13.287
Most dads don't want little girls,
but Nicky always did.

1:12:14.955 --> 1:12:15.998
Hey.

1:12:16.832 --> 1:12:18.792
You didn't need to come.

1:12:18.876 --> 1:12:20.085
Sorry, excuse me.

1:12:20.169 --> 1:12:21.295
You didn't have to come.

1:12:21.378 --> 1:12:23.630
-I got cereal for the kids.
-Thank you.

1:12:23.714 --> 1:12:25.257
-Hey! Hey!

1:12:25.758 --> 1:12:27.718
-I'll be right back. Sorry.
-Sure.

1:12:28.510 --> 1:12:29.345
Hi, Frank.

1:12:30.554 --> 1:12:31.930
I just wanted to, uh,

1:12:33.265 --> 1:12:34.683
discuss Nick's claim.

1:12:35.976 --> 1:12:38.228
I already told you, we're not making one.

1:12:38.312 --> 1:12:40.439
Yeah, I know, of course, but I just…

1:12:40.522 --> 1:12:43.275
You know, just in case Karen decides to…

1:12:43.359 --> 1:12:45.444
Here, let me… Can I show you something?

1:12:47.946 --> 1:12:50.407
This… I wanna show this number here.

1:12:52.993 --> 1:12:54.078
That's just, uh…

1:12:54.828 --> 1:12:57.247
That's a presumptive calculation.
That means…

1:12:57.331 --> 1:12:59.249
I know what it means to presume.

1:13:05.172 --> 1:13:07.424
You and Nick were… were very close.

1:13:10.302 --> 1:13:11.136
Yeah.

1:13:12.638 --> 1:13:13.972
He was my kid brother.

1:13:16.058 --> 1:13:17.601
So I… I have to assume

1:13:18.102 --> 1:13:18.936
you would know

1:13:19.686 --> 1:13:22.356
if there was something that Nick

1:13:23.690 --> 1:13:26.402
wouldn't necessarily want Karen to know.

1:13:30.781 --> 1:13:32.199
My brother was a family man.

1:13:32.783 --> 1:13:34.576
Of course. Of course, yeah.

1:13:38.872 --> 1:13:40.249
We are not signing nothing.

1:13:40.749 --> 1:13:43.669
Frank, this is money for those boys.

1:13:43.752 --> 1:13:45.671
It's tax-free.
It's not every day the government--

1:13:45.754 --> 1:13:49.425
Nicky died 'cause of people like you
holding the purse strings.

1:13:49.925 --> 1:13:52.094
Now you think you could come here
and make it right

1:13:52.177 --> 1:13:53.971
by tossing money on his grave?

1:13:58.267 --> 1:13:59.560
Get out of his house.

1:14:02.438 --> 1:14:03.439
All right.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:29.923
See, this is Tom Jr.

1:14:30.716 --> 1:14:32.426
Don't you think he looks older?

1:14:33.135 --> 1:14:37.055
Tom Jr.'s the one not in uniform.
He was a civilian contractor.

1:14:37.723 --> 1:14:40.225
His brother, Dave,
rejoined to fight for him.

1:14:40.726 --> 1:14:42.019
That's very brave.

1:14:42.102 --> 1:14:44.062
They were only 11 months apart.

1:14:44.605 --> 1:14:46.773
Like two peas in a pod growing up.

1:14:48.150 --> 1:14:51.153
I had a chance to meet Tom's partner,
Graham Morris.

1:14:51.236 --> 1:14:52.905
-The gold digger?
-Tom.

1:14:55.240 --> 1:14:58.911
What my husband means to say
is that man is a liar.

1:14:59.578 --> 1:15:03.290
He and Tom were living together.
He said that they had plans to--

1:15:03.373 --> 1:15:05.042
They were roommates.

1:15:06.210 --> 1:15:08.504
Tom had girlfriends. He would…

1:15:09.588 --> 1:15:11.048
-Mrs…?
-Biros.

1:15:11.131 --> 1:15:15.135
Mrs. Biros, this boy had a long history

1:15:15.219 --> 1:15:17.679
of being infatuated with our son.

1:15:18.222 --> 1:15:21.058
He tried to get his hooks in him,
but Tom did…

1:15:23.435 --> 1:15:25.103
We knew our son.

1:15:25.812 --> 1:15:30.108
These guys just crawl out of the woodwork.

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:33.779
I'm sure your office sees a lot of those.

1:15:35.864 --> 1:15:37.824
I didn't get that sense from him.

1:15:39.409 --> 1:15:40.953
Isn't that always the way?

1:15:52.714 --> 1:15:55.300
Rumor has it
that your numbers are a little stagnant.

1:15:55.384 --> 1:15:56.677
Still plenty of time.

1:15:56.760 --> 1:15:59.221
You had plenty of time,
and you've signed what, 900?

1:15:59.846 --> 1:16:01.557
That's… That's not enough, Ken.

1:16:04.476 --> 1:16:05.686
You know, I…

1:16:06.311 --> 1:16:09.147
I sat down with your friend, Charles Wolf.

1:16:09.231 --> 1:16:11.650
-Wolf? Well, good luck with him.

1:16:11.733 --> 1:16:13.652
He's fighting for the "left behind,"
by the way.

1:16:13.735 --> 1:16:16.029
He's not trying to help
the rich get richer.

1:16:16.113 --> 1:16:19.741
See, it's that kind of accusation
that has people calling you insensitive.

1:16:19.825 --> 1:16:20.993
Doesn't matter.

1:16:23.245 --> 1:16:25.789
Anyway, I emphasized our common ground.

1:16:25.872 --> 1:16:28.041
A rising tide lifts all boats.

1:16:28.125 --> 1:16:30.210
I think
I'm mixing a metaphor.

1:16:30.294 --> 1:16:33.589
But the point is,
if his supporters join our cause,

1:16:33.672 --> 1:16:36.425
we have enough participants
to certify a suit.

1:16:37.134 --> 1:16:38.093
Hold on here.

1:16:39.595 --> 1:16:41.471
Are you threatening a class action?

1:16:41.972 --> 1:16:44.391
No, I'm offering to help you out here.

1:16:44.474 --> 1:16:45.350
Bullshit.

1:16:45.434 --> 1:16:46.893
You can afford to roll the dice,

1:16:46.977 --> 1:16:49.479
to win or lose a case
over the course of 15 years,

1:16:49.563 --> 1:16:51.231
Most of those people cannot.

1:16:51.315 --> 1:16:55.068
Well, with all due respect, you haven't
met these people, your staff has.

1:16:55.152 --> 1:16:57.404
And I got news for ya.

1:16:57.487 --> 1:16:59.031
They hate your guts.

1:16:59.114 --> 1:17:01.158
Well, maybe they do, maybe they don't.

1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:04.286
What I'm offering them is a choice,

1:17:04.369 --> 1:17:07.080
and I'm here as a friend
to give you the same.

1:17:07.581 --> 1:17:12.502
Raise the ceiling on the top awards,
and I'll deliver everybody to your fund.

1:17:13.003 --> 1:17:14.379
Wrapped in a bow.

1:17:17.799 --> 1:17:19.468
Let's win this together, Ken.

1:17:21.136 --> 1:17:23.180
This isn't the latest number,
is it, Ken?

1:17:23.889 --> 1:17:25.015
Fifteen percent?

1:17:25.682 --> 1:17:29.102
John, we still have four months
till the statutory deadline,

1:17:29.186 --> 1:17:30.687
but I'm… I'm confident.

1:17:30.771 --> 1:17:31.897
Oh, I know.

1:17:32.481 --> 1:17:33.482
Confident.

1:17:35.067 --> 1:17:36.652
Companies are getting nervous, Ken.

1:17:38.904 --> 1:17:42.157
John, I didn't know we were, uh,
having a meeting with the airline lobby.

1:17:42.658 --> 1:17:44.159
I'm just here to listen.

1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:47.412
We're told Lee Quinn
is planning to bring suit

1:17:47.496 --> 1:17:49.414
unless you give more money at the top.

1:17:49.956 --> 1:17:52.292
Look, Quinn is not the issue.

1:17:52.376 --> 1:17:54.836
You really want to change the law
to help people?

1:17:55.921 --> 1:17:58.674
There are plenty
of emergency workers and firemen.

1:17:58.757 --> 1:18:02.469
They inhaled toxic chemicals.
Didn't get sick till months later.

1:18:02.969 --> 1:18:05.180
-This law doesn't cover them.
-No.

1:18:05.263 --> 1:18:07.516
That would be unproductive.

1:18:07.599 --> 1:18:11.311
If you change rules, this gets kicked
back to the Congress for a comment period.

1:18:11.812 --> 1:18:14.648
-Have you experienced a comment period?
-No.

1:18:14.731 --> 1:18:18.110
They'll be on their soapboxes ten months
after the whole statute's kaput.

1:18:18.193 --> 1:18:20.070
The whole economy is in the toilet.

1:18:20.153 --> 1:18:22.280
Nobody gets anything,
including re-elected.

1:18:22.364 --> 1:18:24.241
So, yeah…

1:18:25.367 --> 1:18:26.201
No.

1:18:26.785 --> 1:18:28.954
Quinn only cares about
the people at the top

1:18:29.037 --> 1:18:31.123
'cause that's where he gets his paycheck.

1:18:31.206 --> 1:18:35.335
-His lawsuit is a problem for us.
-Look, I work for the taxpayers.

1:18:35.419 --> 1:18:36.962
We pay our share of taxes too.

1:18:37.045 --> 1:18:39.548
Yeah, but you don't have to look
the victims in the eye.

1:18:39.631 --> 1:18:42.592
As the special master,
you have broad discretionary power,

1:18:42.676 --> 1:18:43.969
even within your formula.

1:18:44.052 --> 1:18:47.305
All we're asking is you use it here
to make Quinn happy so he goes away.

1:18:50.016 --> 1:18:52.394
Like I said Ken, neutral party.

1:18:53.145 --> 1:18:56.314
You have DOJ's support,
whatever you decide.

1:20:41.795 --> 1:20:42.963
Mr. Feinberg?

1:20:43.588 --> 1:20:45.423
-I thought I might see you here.
-Uh…

1:20:46.925 --> 1:20:48.635
-Hello, Mr. Wolf.
-Hi.

1:20:50.178 --> 1:20:53.932
I think Katherine would have appreciated
this modern stuff, but I don't…

1:20:54.015 --> 1:20:56.810
I… I can't understand music
that you have to,

1:20:57.644 --> 1:20:59.646
you know, struggle to listen to.

1:20:59.729 --> 1:21:01.273
-You know?

1:21:01.356 --> 1:21:04.234
I… I do. Well, Puccini, it ain't.

1:21:05.277 --> 1:21:07.070
We can agree on that.

1:21:07.779 --> 1:21:10.323
So I thought
you'd be in the seat of honor.

1:21:13.201 --> 1:21:14.202
Oh.

1:21:15.161 --> 1:21:17.497
-That bad, huh?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1:21:18.874 --> 1:21:20.166
You know, um…

1:21:22.127 --> 1:21:25.005
the reason I even wanted to do this,
was I really believed

1:21:25.088 --> 1:21:28.300
I should serve my country
in its time of need. I did.

1:21:28.383 --> 1:21:29.968
Maybe part of that's ego,

1:21:30.552 --> 1:21:33.013
but… here we are.

1:21:34.306 --> 1:21:38.894
I've got, what, 1100 families on board

1:21:38.977 --> 1:21:41.646
and 6,000 more to go.

1:21:42.522 --> 1:21:44.316
Uh-huh. Yeah, well…

1:21:45.191 --> 1:21:48.653
I just want you to know
that I know the fund's not perfect.

1:21:50.947 --> 1:21:54.868
There are people who just don't fit
within the rules that we wrote.

1:21:57.495 --> 1:21:58.496
I know that.

1:22:02.208 --> 1:22:03.793
I honestly don't know

1:22:05.378 --> 1:22:06.379
what to do.

1:22:09.341 --> 1:22:11.468
Remember that you're not the bridge.

1:22:12.928 --> 1:22:13.929
Okay.

1:22:15.096 --> 1:22:16.598
Sounds like a fortune cookie.

1:22:18.058 --> 1:22:19.267
Katherine and I,

1:22:19.768 --> 1:22:22.771
this town that we lived in years ago
in Upstate New York.

1:22:22.854 --> 1:22:24.689
-Uh, Ithaca, you know.
-Uh-huh.

1:22:24.773 --> 1:22:27.108
There was
this gorgeous bridge.

1:22:28.068 --> 1:22:31.321
Depression-era. Beautiful.
To me? Beautiful.

1:22:31.988 --> 1:22:34.115
And developers wanted to knock it down

1:22:34.616 --> 1:22:36.576
'cause they were gonna
put in an interstate.

1:22:37.077 --> 1:22:38.787
So I got on the city council,

1:22:39.329 --> 1:22:42.499
and I spent two years,
and all of our savings,

1:22:43.792 --> 1:22:46.002
fighting for that hunk of concrete.

1:22:47.879 --> 1:22:49.464
And when they demolished it,

1:22:51.299 --> 1:22:53.635
I sat around the house
moping for a couple of weeks,

1:22:53.718 --> 1:22:55.303
feeling sorry for myself.

1:22:56.346 --> 1:22:57.472
And then Katherine,

1:22:58.974 --> 1:23:03.645
you know, she looked at me one day,
and she told me that.

1:23:05.438 --> 1:23:07.899
"You're not the bridge." Mmm.

1:23:07.983 --> 1:23:09.067
It is rubble,

1:23:09.651 --> 1:23:10.694
I'm not.

1:23:11.820 --> 1:23:12.862
I am still here.

1:23:14.823 --> 1:23:15.824
Mmm.

1:23:15.907 --> 1:23:18.284
Fighting a new lost cause, but you know…

1:23:18.368 --> 1:23:20.870
-Which is me, I suppose.
-No. No, no, no.

1:23:20.954 --> 1:23:24.582
No, that's… See, I have
nothing against you, Mr. Feinberg.

1:23:24.666 --> 1:23:25.959
-Look--
-I wanna make that clear.

1:23:26.042 --> 1:23:26.876
-Okay.
-Okay?

1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:30.922
I just… Look, I may have screwed
this whole thing up.

1:23:31.006 --> 1:23:32.215
Very possible.

1:23:32.298 --> 1:23:34.300
But if I try to fix it now,

1:23:34.384 --> 1:23:37.387
if I even go on record
saying this thing even needs fixing,

1:23:37.470 --> 1:23:41.099
trust me, courts are gonna throw it back
to Congress and they'll let it die.

1:23:41.182 --> 1:23:44.102
Nothing for anyone, just dead.

1:23:46.312 --> 1:23:48.064
-Then it deserves to be.
-Why?

1:23:48.148 --> 1:23:50.984
-Because it's not perfect?
-No. No.

1:23:51.609 --> 1:23:53.987
Because it's not just.

1:23:54.070 --> 1:23:56.406
But I can't change that.

1:23:56.489 --> 1:23:58.533
Well, something has to change.

1:23:58.616 --> 1:23:59.576
Find it.

1:25:20.949 --> 1:25:23.368
Call off the search party.
I found him.

1:25:24.786 --> 1:25:25.912
Did you sleep here?

1:25:25.995 --> 1:25:27.497
I guess so.

1:25:28.998 --> 1:25:33.169
I was going through these cases,
the uncommitted ones.

1:25:33.795 --> 1:25:37.298
What's going on with that, uh…
the civil union suit you're working on?

1:25:37.382 --> 1:25:39.342
Um, that's one of dozens.

1:25:39.425 --> 1:25:41.636
It won't be an issue
for New York residents

1:25:41.719 --> 1:25:44.305
'cause Pataki just extended
the spousal benefits

1:25:44.389 --> 1:25:46.850
for gay people whose partners died.

1:25:46.933 --> 1:25:48.935
Virginia legislature feels differently.

1:25:51.062 --> 1:25:53.106
Then we gotta
call the governor, right?

1:25:53.606 --> 1:25:56.985
Look, obviously we can't help everyone
with special interests.

1:25:57.068 --> 1:26:00.029
We still have to set limits,
but it's a start.

1:26:00.530 --> 1:26:02.740
Now, that's the civil union, right?

1:26:02.824 --> 1:26:05.577
Some of these poor people,
these first responders, this is trickier.

1:26:05.660 --> 1:26:07.453
They didn't know
they were sick for months.

1:26:07.537 --> 1:26:09.080
-Look at these. This is…
-Ken.

1:26:09.164 --> 1:26:11.332
I know.
We're gonna have to take the heat on it.

1:26:11.416 --> 1:26:13.918
We're gonna have to set the formula aside.

1:26:14.002 --> 1:26:15.503
-Ken--
-I know. I know. I know.

1:26:16.045 --> 1:26:19.799
I know. We're in the weeds here.
That's where we should be.

1:26:19.883 --> 1:26:23.553
If we do this, we have to go
the whole way. Can't go halfway.

1:26:23.636 --> 1:26:26.014
We have to consider
every claimant individually.

1:26:26.097 --> 1:26:29.309
If they can't come here to see us,
we'll have to go and see them.

1:26:29.392 --> 1:26:30.977
You understand? Good.

1:26:31.060 --> 1:26:32.604
What? You don't like it.

1:26:34.022 --> 1:26:34.939
We love it.

1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:37.358
Oh. Good.

1:26:37.859 --> 1:26:40.361
All right, set some meetings.
I'm gonna get coffee.

1:26:47.076 --> 1:26:49.871
Me and a few of the other stronger guys,

1:26:49.954 --> 1:26:54.626
we pried open the doors
so that everyone could… could get away.

1:26:56.502 --> 1:26:58.254
But that's… that's when it happened.

1:26:59.130 --> 1:27:03.301
Uh, the oxygen ignited all the fuel and…

1:27:10.475 --> 1:27:11.476
that was it.

1:27:12.352 --> 1:27:13.561
Guy like me thinks he's tough.

1:27:13.645 --> 1:27:15.939
Thinks he can handle anything
that's thrown at him.

1:27:17.523 --> 1:27:21.778
That's until you look in the eyes
of a five-year-old and a six-year-old,

1:27:21.861 --> 1:27:23.196
and you tell 'em that, uh…

1:27:25.365 --> 1:27:27.200
that you've been lying to 'em,

1:27:27.700 --> 1:27:30.245
and that, uh, Mommy's not coming home.

1:27:31.454 --> 1:27:35.792
…and asked me if he was wearing
his wedding ring, and I said, "No. Why?"

1:27:38.586 --> 1:27:40.004
You need something?

1:27:40.546 --> 1:27:43.424
Oh, I thought I'd join in, uh,

1:27:44.259 --> 1:27:45.635
just perhaps listen, but--

1:27:45.718 --> 1:27:47.178
Sandra, is that okay?

1:27:53.184 --> 1:27:55.270
Go on. Whenever you're ready.

1:27:58.439 --> 1:28:01.192
I used to ask each time he flew
for school or work,

1:28:01.276 --> 1:28:03.069
I would ask for his itinerary.

1:28:05.113 --> 1:28:07.490
Just so I could breathe a little easier

1:28:08.741 --> 1:28:10.326
knowing he landed…

1:28:13.121 --> 1:28:14.747
back on solid ground.

1:28:23.881 --> 1:28:26.009
It takes a parent to know that feeling…

1:28:28.803 --> 1:28:30.513
and I'll never have it again.

1:28:36.477 --> 1:28:38.146
It's a fishing fly.

1:28:39.397 --> 1:28:40.898
He made them…

1:28:41.858 --> 1:28:43.234
We made them together.

1:28:44.068 --> 1:28:46.904
My wife and I want you to keep it.

1:28:48.781 --> 1:28:50.074
Well, thank you.

1:28:50.783 --> 1:28:51.784
Thank you.

1:28:52.660 --> 1:28:59.042
We were told, uh, because he
suffered about 90% burns over his body,

1:28:59.125 --> 1:29:05.089
he might not appear
to be the same person we know him to be.

1:29:06.591 --> 1:29:10.553
And then we got a call
from the medical examiner's office

1:29:10.636 --> 1:29:12.764
saying that there was a mix-up

1:29:14.515 --> 1:29:17.018
and we had to make another identification.

1:29:18.102 --> 1:29:20.229
It turned out we spent four days

1:29:21.397 --> 1:29:23.149
at the bedside of a stranger…

1:29:26.194 --> 1:29:27.195
…while Alex…

1:29:31.574 --> 1:29:32.533
While he died.

1:29:34.994 --> 1:29:37.455
You know,
my wife and I, we were thinking,

1:29:37.538 --> 1:29:39.832
"Gosh, those poor people."

1:29:40.333 --> 1:29:43.669
Because at first, you assume
it's… it's happening to someone else.

1:29:43.753 --> 1:29:45.880
And then within a few hours,

1:29:45.963 --> 1:29:49.467
they, of course, confirmed
that she was there for a meeting.

1:29:49.967 --> 1:29:53.596
We realized we were one of those people.

1:29:53.679 --> 1:29:55.556
I mean, it… it was staggering.

1:29:56.265 --> 1:29:58.434
Sure. I'm sorry.

1:29:58.518 --> 1:30:00.478
I was on the 85th floor.

1:30:00.978 --> 1:30:03.272
We actually started
going down the stairs early.

1:30:03.356 --> 1:30:04.816
Well, you can call me Jean.

1:30:04.899 --> 1:30:07.276
Jean, tell me more about your son.

1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:09.612
Like, when did he move away from Iowa?

1:30:09.695 --> 1:30:11.781
In 1997.

1:30:12.281 --> 1:30:14.784
He got a job as an analyst right away.

1:30:14.867 --> 1:30:16.702
He was actually so excited.

1:30:17.578 --> 1:30:18.496
It's up to you,

1:30:18.579 --> 1:30:20.915
but I think you should take
what the government's giving.

1:30:20.998 --> 1:30:22.834
-I got bad anxiety.
-Jerry.

1:30:22.917 --> 1:30:25.086
I don't know.
I don't sleep much at all.

1:30:25.169 --> 1:30:28.589
-Yeah, I can't imagine.
-I had to move out of the city.

1:30:28.673 --> 1:30:30.550
Couldn't bear seeing
the hole in the skyline.

1:30:30.633 --> 1:30:33.886
I want to do everything I can
to expedite this process.

1:30:33.970 --> 1:30:36.264
-Well, Florida's nice.
-Yeah.

1:30:36.347 --> 1:30:39.016
"It seems as if I don't feel anything,

1:30:39.100 --> 1:30:41.436
but inside I do."

1:30:42.979 --> 1:30:45.982
"Inside, I wanna burst
and just talk to everyone

1:30:46.065 --> 1:30:48.317
about what I'm holding in."

1:30:51.028 --> 1:30:52.822
"I wanna say how much pain I have,

1:30:52.905 --> 1:30:55.741
and I wanna say
all the pressure that I have."

1:30:58.327 --> 1:31:00.746
"I have to control myself emotionally."

1:31:01.581 --> 1:31:04.500
"I have to help with them
and be strong for them,

1:31:04.584 --> 1:31:07.211
but also still be strong for me."

1:31:08.504 --> 1:31:09.839
"My dad was good at that."

1:31:10.339 --> 1:31:12.258
"I have to be the man that he was."

1:31:28.983 --> 1:31:30.443
It's not enough.

1:31:33.112 --> 1:31:35.448
So we keep going,
right up to the deadline.

1:31:35.531 --> 1:31:38.117
Maybe we get the word out wider,
make a public statement.

1:31:38.201 --> 1:31:39.243
Nah.

1:31:39.327 --> 1:31:41.704
If you announce this publicly,
it starts to look like

1:31:41.787 --> 1:31:45.625
there's a change in policy,
then the law goes back to Congress…

1:31:50.087 --> 1:31:52.340
What if
someone else announces it?

1:31:53.049 --> 1:31:55.176
So you're meeting with people.

1:31:55.843 --> 1:31:56.719
Yeah.

1:31:57.595 --> 1:32:02.600
And I hear you've been telling them
that you're throwing out the formula.

1:32:02.683 --> 1:32:06.312
Nope. The law gives me discretion,
which someone reminded me.

1:32:06.395 --> 1:32:07.730
So I'm going to use it.

1:32:07.813 --> 1:32:12.902
But I promise you, if people come aboard,
I will do everything I can to help them.

1:32:16.864 --> 1:32:19.617
Guaranteed by what, your word?

1:32:19.700 --> 1:32:21.244
Oh, Charles. I… I mean…

1:32:22.495 --> 1:32:23.329
What?

1:32:23.871 --> 1:32:25.206
No, I'm sorry.

1:32:25.289 --> 1:32:29.460
Mr. Feinberg,
you've been telling us for two years

1:32:30.086 --> 1:32:33.172
that you're nothing but a numbers cruncher
for the government,

1:32:33.798 --> 1:32:36.133
and now you're asking us to trust you.

1:32:36.217 --> 1:32:37.635
No, I'm asking you.

1:32:38.386 --> 1:32:40.930
You already have their trust,
and you earned it.

1:32:41.430 --> 1:32:42.932
Help them trust me too.

1:32:45.768 --> 1:32:47.436
Are you just trying to win?

1:32:47.520 --> 1:32:49.647
No, I'm trying to make things right.

1:32:58.990 --> 1:33:00.950
When's your deposition with Lee Quinn?

1:33:02.285 --> 1:33:03.703
Uh, Monday.

1:33:05.288 --> 1:33:07.498
He's gonna tell you you wanted kids.

1:33:09.500 --> 1:33:12.837
Forty-year-old married female
who was pregnant,

1:33:12.920 --> 1:33:15.715
or even she's just trying to get pregnant,

1:33:16.215 --> 1:33:18.426
the damage settlement shoots way up.

1:33:18.509 --> 1:33:20.219
Way up. Skyward.

1:33:20.303 --> 1:33:22.805
And Quinn's gonna coach you
through every step.

1:33:22.888 --> 1:33:25.266
When to cry, when to quiver your lip.

1:33:29.562 --> 1:33:30.855
How do you know this?

1:33:30.938 --> 1:33:32.481
'Cause we're the same guy.

1:33:33.274 --> 1:33:34.442
That's what I'd do.

1:33:59.508 --> 1:34:01.135
Ashcroft stood you up?

1:34:02.094 --> 1:34:05.514
Uh, he's under pressure of his own.

1:34:08.643 --> 1:34:10.227
Do you think it's a message?

1:34:10.728 --> 1:34:12.355
Give Quinn what he wants?

1:34:13.356 --> 1:34:14.649
I'm not suggesting it.

1:34:15.775 --> 1:34:18.944
There's still time. You always say
they'll come in at the deadline.

1:34:19.654 --> 1:34:20.780
What if I'm wrong?

1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:24.867
What if I'm wrong, Camille?

1:34:30.456 --> 1:34:31.290
Sorry.

1:34:31.791 --> 1:34:35.002
You did everything you could.
Everyone did everything they could.

1:34:36.337 --> 1:34:39.840
-A call for you, Ken. Lawyer from Queens.

1:34:39.924 --> 1:34:41.092
Name's Cuthbert.

1:34:41.175 --> 1:34:42.426
Take a message, please.

1:34:42.510 --> 1:34:45.346
He already left you three.
It's about the Donato case.

1:34:45.429 --> 1:34:48.391
He says
if you don't tell the widow, he will,

1:34:48.474 --> 1:34:50.893
and tell you that you have until tomorrow.

1:34:55.690 --> 1:34:56.691
Ken?

1:34:59.193 --> 1:35:01.112
Grab my bag out of the trunk,
please.

1:35:02.530 --> 1:35:04.323
Come on, guys. It's time to come in.

1:35:04.824 --> 1:35:06.200
Karen isn't home yet.

1:35:08.077 --> 1:35:09.495
She told me you called.

1:35:10.121 --> 1:35:11.747
Said you wouldn't tell her why.

1:35:12.248 --> 1:35:13.582
When will she be back?

1:35:15.501 --> 1:35:16.752
Put away your checkbook.

1:35:17.253 --> 1:35:18.587
We're joining the lawsuit.

1:35:19.630 --> 1:35:22.466
Well, you'll… you'll do whatever
you have to do.

1:35:23.968 --> 1:35:26.220
Yeah. But you know better, right?

1:35:26.303 --> 1:35:29.432
No, I… I would not presume or judge.

1:35:29.515 --> 1:35:30.391
Bullshit.

1:35:31.016 --> 1:35:34.019
You see her being loyal to a dead guy,
you can't imagine why.

1:35:34.729 --> 1:35:37.440
Frank, the signing deadline is Saturday,

1:35:37.523 --> 1:35:40.818
and after that you won't see me anymore.

1:35:43.070 --> 1:35:45.197
It's the first thing you said
I'm glad to hear.

1:35:47.032 --> 1:35:49.493
I'm still gonna
have to talk to Karen first.

1:35:50.035 --> 1:35:52.163
Yeah, like I said, she's not home.

1:35:52.705 --> 1:35:54.373
Tell me, I'll pass it along.

1:35:55.332 --> 1:35:57.084
I don't think you would, Frank.

1:35:57.168 --> 1:35:59.170
In fact, I think you already know.

1:36:01.172 --> 1:36:04.508
You don't have to protect him anymore.
Nick's gone.

1:36:04.592 --> 1:36:07.428
You didn't know Nick. He was a good man.

1:36:08.512 --> 1:36:09.930
This is not about Nick.

1:36:18.731 --> 1:36:20.107
He went back in for me.

1:36:20.691 --> 1:36:21.734
Into the tower.

1:36:22.735 --> 1:36:24.612
-Did you know that?
-No.

1:36:26.363 --> 1:36:29.074
For all I know,
he heard the evac orders on his radio,

1:36:29.158 --> 1:36:31.410
and he said,
"Fuck it, my brother's in there."

1:36:31.494 --> 1:36:33.996
He died trying to save me,
and you think I should…

1:36:34.079 --> 1:36:35.664
I should forget about that?

1:36:37.166 --> 1:36:38.626
Don't you have a family?

1:36:39.126 --> 1:36:42.046
If you died tomorrow, what's the worst
they'd find out about you, huh?

1:36:42.129 --> 1:36:44.882
-Maybe you're not such a hero either.
-I'm not a hero.

1:36:44.965 --> 1:36:46.675
Yeah, well, Nick was.

1:36:46.759 --> 1:36:49.345
Nick was.
He was a family man. He was a good man.

1:36:49.428 --> 1:36:51.806
And that's why
he'd want his children taken care of.

1:36:52.306 --> 1:36:53.307
All of them.

1:36:53.849 --> 1:36:55.851
Frank, if I were you,

1:36:56.644 --> 1:36:57.520
honestly,

1:36:58.771 --> 1:37:00.231
I don't know what I would do.

1:37:00.314 --> 1:37:01.273
I can't imagine.

1:37:01.941 --> 1:37:04.527
I might… I might wanna sue the hell
out of everyone.

1:37:05.486 --> 1:37:07.696
But you're not the only ones left behind.

1:37:07.780 --> 1:37:09.198
I know you know that.

1:37:11.325 --> 1:37:14.662
That family wants the money
so they can just move on,

1:37:14.745 --> 1:37:16.622
and I think they deserve it,

1:37:16.705 --> 1:37:18.874
and I think Nick would think so too.

1:37:23.295 --> 1:37:24.296
That's why I'm…

1:37:25.381 --> 1:37:27.842
I'm gonna count them
as equal beneficiaries.

1:37:27.925 --> 1:37:29.677
I just thought Karen should know,

1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:31.512
and I wanted to tell her myself

1:37:32.221 --> 1:37:34.765
so she didn't have to read it
in the public record.

1:37:34.849 --> 1:37:35.975
What are their names?

1:37:36.058 --> 1:37:37.726
-Karen, go back in the house.
-No.

1:37:38.853 --> 1:37:39.854
I wanna know.

1:37:43.983 --> 1:37:45.860
Uh, Jenna and Belle.

1:37:56.996 --> 1:37:58.747
He always wanted girls.

1:38:11.969 --> 1:38:13.470
-You happy?

1:38:49.173 --> 1:38:50.174
Mail's here.

1:38:54.553 --> 1:38:56.972
-Do y'all wanna sign for these together?
-I'll sign.

1:39:00.643 --> 1:39:02.811
What's it look like there?
How many we got?

1:39:06.857 --> 1:39:09.526
-How many do you have?
-Thirty. Maybe 40.

1:39:10.736 --> 1:39:11.820
Me too.

1:39:33.300 --> 1:39:34.218
I'm sorry.

1:39:36.011 --> 1:39:38.764
You did the best you could.

1:39:40.683 --> 1:39:41.517
Did I?

1:39:42.518 --> 1:39:44.436
I'm still sorry.

1:39:53.237 --> 1:39:55.614
You just ask the question?

1:39:58.283 --> 1:39:59.451
Five.

1:39:59.535 --> 1:40:02.621
One, two, three, four, five.

1:40:43.162 --> 1:40:44.872
You're working too hard, Ken.

1:40:46.123 --> 1:40:49.084
-Get yourself a drink.
-No, I'm… I'm fine.

1:40:49.585 --> 1:40:51.128
Let's just get on with it.

1:40:53.589 --> 1:40:55.132
Don't think I don't respect it.

1:40:55.841 --> 1:40:58.427
Your whole crusade.

1:40:59.344 --> 1:41:01.972
-That's not what this is.
-No, I know. I know.

1:41:03.390 --> 1:41:05.517
You're Robin Hood.
You're solving everybody's problem

1:41:05.601 --> 1:41:06.810
one good deed at a time.

1:41:09.855 --> 1:41:11.315
You poisoned the well.

1:41:12.107 --> 1:41:13.192
You did, Lee.

1:41:13.776 --> 1:41:16.236
You poisoned the well.
You played on people's fear

1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:18.489
and their pain and their anger,

1:41:18.572 --> 1:41:20.407
their distrust of government,

1:41:20.491 --> 1:41:22.826
to act against their own best interest.

1:41:22.910 --> 1:41:25.954
Look, my girl's birthday is today.

1:41:26.038 --> 1:41:27.247
Caterer's coming.

1:41:27.748 --> 1:41:30.459
-You gonna meet these numbers or what?
-Give me a pen.

1:41:35.881 --> 1:41:38.675
Look, I know, I know it hurts,

1:41:39.176 --> 1:41:41.011
but fair is not the goal.

1:41:41.845 --> 1:41:43.514
It's finish and move on.

1:41:46.475 --> 1:41:47.309
What?

1:41:51.772 --> 1:41:52.731
I said that.

1:41:53.315 --> 1:41:55.150
Yeah, you probably did.

1:41:55.776 --> 1:41:58.070
You've always been my hero, Ken.

1:41:58.946 --> 1:42:01.782
I watched you argue
in front of Fuld, 1984.

1:42:01.865 --> 1:42:03.951
You had hair then.

1:42:04.034 --> 1:42:07.871
Doubt you believed a word you said,
but, man, did it sound good.

1:42:09.706 --> 1:42:11.834
-What are you doing? Ken.

1:42:14.503 --> 1:42:15.587
Don't be an idiot.

1:42:17.089 --> 1:42:18.173
Ken.

1:42:18.799 --> 1:42:19.800
Come on, man.

1:42:20.676 --> 1:42:22.010
Change your high, Lee.

1:42:23.637 --> 1:42:24.763
Ken.

1:42:24.847 --> 1:42:25.681
Ken!

1:43:17.608 --> 1:43:18.442
Ken.

1:43:19.026 --> 1:43:21.236
-What is going on here?
-The families.

1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:24.865
It's been like this all morning.
Some calls, some walk-ins.

1:43:24.948 --> 1:43:26.992
Suddenly everyone
wants to have a private meeting.

1:43:27.075 --> 1:43:28.660
-Why?

1:43:32.456 --> 1:43:36.585
"By now, many of us have sat down
with Mr. Feinberg, looked him in the eye."

1:43:36.668 --> 1:43:39.296
"We've told him
it's not the money that we're after."

1:43:39.379 --> 1:43:44.134
"It's for our own government, this system,
to treat us all with dignity, respect."

1:43:44.718 --> 1:43:46.720
"Well, I can't speak for the system,

1:43:46.803 --> 1:43:49.514
but I have come to believe
in Mr. Feinberg."

1:43:50.224 --> 1:43:54.353
"That's why I'm happy to announce
the fund is fixed."

1:43:55.562 --> 1:43:56.980
We just passed 65%.

1:43:57.064 --> 1:43:58.440
Oh my God.

1:43:58.523 --> 1:44:01.109
-All right, let's keep going, everybody.

1:44:01.193 --> 1:44:03.570
-We're really doing it.
-Well done, everybody.

1:44:03.654 --> 1:44:04.988
I'm still looking at it.

1:44:05.113 --> 1:44:07.241
-I need your number right there.
-Yeah.

1:44:07.324 --> 1:44:09.284
Would you be able
to bring that by before00?

1:44:09.368 --> 1:44:10.327
Uh-huh.

1:44:11.078 --> 1:44:12.079
Is that Richmond?

1:44:12.162 --> 1:44:14.873
-I need that as soon as you're done.
-Yeah, yeah.

1:44:14.957 --> 1:44:17.376
Well, I know your kids start school soon.

1:44:18.627 --> 1:44:22.464
If you would like,
we can fax a redirect payment

1:44:22.547 --> 1:44:24.841
right into the tuition account,

1:44:24.925 --> 1:44:26.843
and, uh, that would be helpful.

1:44:26.927 --> 1:44:28.011
How's that sound?

1:44:28.512 --> 1:44:32.975
What… What I can do is, um,
is fax the materials to a copy center.

1:44:33.058 --> 1:44:34.434
Are you near one of those?

1:44:34.518 --> 1:44:37.062
Uh, you know what?
I can look that up for you.

1:44:37.145 --> 1:44:39.481
You're… You're still
at the Arthur Ave. address?

1:44:47.823 --> 1:44:48.657
Hello.

1:44:49.658 --> 1:44:50.492
Charles.

1:44:52.327 --> 1:44:53.829
I should get back to it.

1:44:54.413 --> 1:44:55.956
-Nice to see you.
-You too.

1:44:57.040 --> 1:44:57.916
Here you go.

1:44:58.625 --> 1:45:00.711
There's still a typo on page three.

1:45:01.336 --> 1:45:02.754
We'll get right on that.

1:45:03.755 --> 1:45:06.341
And, uh, you were wrong about Lee Quinn.

1:45:06.925 --> 1:45:08.552
He didn't try to coach you?

1:45:09.177 --> 1:45:10.012
He did,

1:45:10.595 --> 1:45:13.432
but you're nothing like him.

1:45:17.853 --> 1:45:18.937
Bye, Mr. Feinberg.

1:45:21.523 --> 1:45:22.357
Ken.

1:45:35.620 --> 1:45:39.624
No, Mrs. Benson.
I've been, uh, handling your claim myself.

1:45:39.708 --> 1:45:44.296
Uh, I know there's been an issue
with your husband's life insurance offset.

1:45:44.379 --> 1:45:46.506
And look, I've been fiddling
with the numbers,

1:45:46.590 --> 1:45:48.592
and, uh, I want to propose something.

1:45:48.675 --> 1:45:50.135
I think you're gonna like it.

1:45:50.761 --> 1:45:53.347
We just wanna make sure
you have everything together.

1:45:53.430 --> 1:45:56.141
This looks good to me.
You filled it out well.

1:45:56.725 --> 1:45:58.310
You guys wanna give me a hand here?

1:46:00.771 --> 1:46:02.481
There's a lot more
down in the truck.

1:46:03.273 --> 1:46:04.399
Please tally it up.

1:46:04.483 --> 1:46:05.317
Thank you.

1:46:05.942 --> 1:46:08.070
All right.
Come on, guys, let's go.

1:46:08.612 --> 1:46:09.613
Let's go, let's go.

1:46:14.576 --> 1:46:16.745
Okay, what have you got?

1:46:18.413 --> 1:46:21.124
A little over 95% so far.

1:46:23.001 --> 1:46:24.503
Should we call the president?

1:46:24.586 --> 1:46:26.254
Let's get drunk.

1:46:26.338 --> 1:46:29.091
-Let's get drunk with the president.

1:46:30.675 --> 1:46:31.676
Yeah.

1:46:56.868 --> 1:47:00.622
Mr. Morris, this is Camille Biros
from the Victim Compensation Fund.

1:47:03.083 --> 1:47:05.252
I'm sure you've heard the news.

1:47:08.046 --> 1:47:11.299
You should know
because of your case,

1:47:12.926 --> 1:47:16.221
we were able to accommodate
a great number of people

1:47:16.304 --> 1:47:18.682
in similar relationships in New York.

1:47:22.644 --> 1:47:23.645
But, um…

1:47:25.063 --> 1:47:26.106
unfortunately,

1:47:27.357 --> 1:47:32.737
Tom's parents being how they are,
and Virginia state law,

1:47:32.821 --> 1:47:35.949
we were not able to accommodate yours.

1:47:39.035 --> 1:47:40.162
I'm so sorry.

1:47:43.874 --> 1:47:45.959
I'm sure that doesn't help.

1:47:59.931 --> 1:48:00.974
Excuse me, sir.

1:48:02.225 --> 1:48:04.644
Hey. Uh, you know, I just…

1:48:04.728 --> 1:48:06.563
I'm gonna talk to him real quick.

1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:10.775
Hey, Mr. Feinberg. I, uh…

1:48:12.569 --> 1:48:14.821
-Look, I'm sorry.
-Come on. Come on over here.

1:48:17.365 --> 1:48:18.742
I, um…

1:48:21.703 --> 1:48:22.704
I just…

1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:26.249
I didn't wanna know.

1:48:27.209 --> 1:48:28.418
I'm not stupid.

1:48:29.044 --> 1:48:30.045
You know?

1:48:32.964 --> 1:48:35.634
He'd get a call after dinner,

1:48:36.635 --> 1:48:38.303
and he would say it was Frank,

1:48:38.887 --> 1:48:42.933
you know, and there was, like,
a three-alarm in the city or whatever.

1:48:44.476 --> 1:48:45.936
He'd kiss me goodbye,

1:48:46.019 --> 1:48:48.647
and I would pretend like
I didn't know that he was lying.

1:48:50.023 --> 1:48:51.650
Then later, I'd be over with Irene,

1:48:51.733 --> 1:48:54.528
and Frank would come home
after drinking with the boys.

1:48:54.611 --> 1:48:57.364
And I would say,
"How'd that three-alarm go?"

1:48:57.447 --> 1:48:59.157
And, you know, he would look at me

1:49:00.116 --> 1:49:03.078
with the straightest face you've ever seen
in your life, and he'd say,

1:49:05.539 --> 1:49:06.748
"Nicky's mopping up,

1:49:08.166 --> 1:49:09.751
but he was a real hero tonight."

1:49:09.834 --> 1:49:11.086
"You should've seen him."

1:49:13.171 --> 1:49:16.007
"Might be a while though,
so don't wait up."

1:49:19.052 --> 1:49:21.638
And, you know,
I don't… I don't hate Frank for that.

1:49:22.847 --> 1:49:24.808
Because Nicky was his little brother.

1:49:27.310 --> 1:49:28.979
I didn't want him to die.

1:49:29.062 --> 1:49:30.313
No, of course not.

1:49:31.439 --> 1:49:33.608
But I used to wish
all sorts of things about her.

1:49:35.277 --> 1:49:36.987
You didn't do anything wrong, Karen.

1:49:37.070 --> 1:49:38.363
No, God tests us.

1:49:38.446 --> 1:49:40.073
No, it's not your fault.

1:49:51.585 --> 1:49:54.754
Will you make sure
that they get what they need?

1:49:55.922 --> 1:49:57.340
His little girls?

1:50:00.427 --> 1:50:01.303
I will.
