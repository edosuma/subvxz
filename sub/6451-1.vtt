01:36.388 --> 01:39.848
Year after year, always trying
to improve, improve.

01:39.975 --> 01:44.655
With more experience,
with more objectives, more desires,

01:45.397 --> 01:47.437
proving to my family,
proving to my dad,

01:47.566 --> 01:50.856
that the decisions I took
in the beginning, at the age of 12,

01:50.986 --> 01:53.316
were the best ones.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.419
There are people who love me.
There are people who hate me...

02:10.172 --> 02:14.052
who say that I'm arrogant,
that I'm vain or I'm this and that.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.303
That's part of my success.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.473
I was made to be the best.

02:24.269 --> 02:29.269
My dear boy!
Your mother's heart almost exploded.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.399
That's what I wanted to say
to you too, Ronaldo!

02:31.527 --> 02:34.567
Oh, my dear boy, you deserved it!

02:36.907 --> 02:42.497
The Ballon d'Or is the very best
individual award for any player.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.172
It means you're considered
the best player in the world.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.685
To see Messi win the Ballon d'Or
four times in a row

03:04.810 --> 03:06.390
was difficult for me.

03:08.939 --> 03:14.569
After he won the second or third
in a row, I said,

03:14.695 --> 03:17.245
"I'm not coming here anymore."

03:18.115 --> 03:20.705
Why do I come here
if I am doing so well for my team?

03:20.826 --> 03:22.326
Why should I come here?

03:25.455 --> 03:27.245
I have to win more Ballons d'Or.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.342
For me, the year gone by
was the best year of my career.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.711
Without any doubt.

04:17.882 --> 04:22.683
I try to fight with my
weapons every day, every match,

04:22.804 --> 04:24.684
throughout my career,
to be the best ever.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.183
That second Ballon d'Or

05:00.300 --> 05:03.640
was obviously one of the most
beautiful moments in my life.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.638
But my ambition ends up
always wanting more,

05:08.767 --> 05:10.137
always wanting more.

05:11.979 --> 05:16.109
A new year,
goals to score, trophies to win...

05:17.317 --> 05:19.897
That is the way I live my life.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.296
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.638
Good morning, Cris.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.274
Come here!

06:34.520 --> 06:37.860
- Give Daddy a kiss!
- Yes. OK.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.896
Silly head.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.423
Let's go.

07:01.255 --> 07:04.885
- Done!
- Give me five! Well done.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.310
The Champions League final
is almost here

07:16.436 --> 07:20.436
and Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid
is searching for a new title.

07:20.566 --> 07:23.686
For the whites, it could be La Decima.

07:23.819 --> 07:27.449
The last time that Real Madrid
won the trophy was in 2002.

07:28.699 --> 07:31.449
...for sure,
Cristiano is doing very well.

07:31.535 --> 07:35.375
Clearly, Ronaldo is on top form,
clearly ready to win.

07:36.039 --> 07:40.919
I knew that after Real Madrid hired me,
the pressure would mount.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.759
Real Madrid wanted to win
the Champions League, La Decima,

07:46.884 --> 07:49.934
and obviously, to win,
you need to have the best players.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.265
- Whoops!
- I didn't get hurt.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.481
Come.

07:55.601 --> 07:56.981
Shall we race to the door?

07:57.644 --> 07:59.774
- Yes.
- Now!

08:02.316 --> 08:05.106
I'm going to win!
I'm going to win!

08:06.570 --> 08:08.860
I won! I won! See?

08:19.333 --> 08:22.633
I was at Manchester for six years.

08:22.753 --> 08:26.423
And... I won practically everything
there was to win.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.394
- Impressive, isn't it?
- This is incredible.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.181
- Is there going to be a match or not?
- No.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.775
That was when Real Madrid showed up.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.520
They were willing to pay
a lot of money for me.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.148
I wanted more. I wanted another league.
I wanted a different kind of football,

08:43.273 --> 08:47.363
and I wanted a different chapter,
a different challenge in my life.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.869
The stadium was full
to welcome me to the team.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.163
90,000 people at the stadium.

09:00.040 --> 09:04.960
I felt like a star,
like a pop star or a Hollywood star.

09:07.172 --> 09:12.302
Today the time has arrived.
Today we welcome to his new home,

09:12.678 --> 09:16.558
today we welcome Cristiano Ronaldo.

09:27.693 --> 09:33.163
For me, I've achieved
my childhood dream,

09:33.282 --> 09:35.952
which was to play for Real Madrid.

09:38.620 --> 09:43.000
I didn't expect the stadium
to be so full today just to see me.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.675
I can't believe it.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.005
Incredible!

09:51.216 --> 09:52.256
Let's go.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.604
One, two, three.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.809
Hala Madrid!

10:03.645 --> 10:06.815
If I had to choose one title,

10:07.399 --> 10:09.859
the Champions League
would surely be the most important.

10:13.071 --> 10:17.121
The mythical Decima
was the most wanted trophy in Madrid.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.211
Preparing the shot.
That one might be a goal.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.430
Goal! Goal for Atlético Madrid.

10:34.551 --> 10:38.931
It's clearly in.
Godin scored. Minute 36.

10:39.056 --> 10:42.556
Atlético takes the lead
on the scoreboard.

10:49.191 --> 10:52.281
400 million viewers all over the world

10:52.402 --> 10:56.492
in more than 200 countries
are watching this match.

10:56.657 --> 11:01.037
And now, Real Madrid
needs to improve and recover

11:01.161 --> 11:03.501
if they want to win La Decima.

13:52.916 --> 13:56.706
And the world's best player,
as well as Real Madrid's,

13:56.837 --> 13:59.837
17 goals in this
year's Champions League...

13:59.923 --> 14:05.223
He is a true champion.
Nothing is impossible for him.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.599
Cristiano.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.760
As we did the first time,

14:47.888 --> 14:52.178
we're all going to shout together.
One, two, three. "Hala Madrid."

14:52.935 --> 14:55.355
One, two, three...

14:55.479 --> 14:57.769
Hala Madrid!

15:25.801 --> 15:28.221
He's a very big man, isn't he?

15:29.137 --> 15:30.637
Bigger than you.

15:30.764 --> 15:34.274
No. Bigger in size,
but Daddy is stronger.

15:34.393 --> 15:36.393
Didn't you know that?

15:47.197 --> 15:49.737
Look. Where's your schoolbag?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.883
Look. Which car is missing?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.210
The Ro...

16:01.336 --> 16:03.956
No, the Rover is outside.
Which car is missing here?

16:04.298 --> 16:06.508
Look at them all. Go on.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.013
Which one is missing?

16:09.678 --> 16:11.218
The Porsche?

16:11.346 --> 16:12.756
Look properly! Look properly!

16:16.476 --> 16:19.226
- The Royce.
- No.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.439
One that is very fast, very fast.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.453
Lamborghini.

16:33.660 --> 16:37.750
- Ah! You didn't know.
- And where is it?

16:37.873 --> 16:41.003
It went to change a tire.
A tire blew up.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.138
Go! Go! Go!

16:58.018 --> 17:00.768
I'm going to be a goalkeeper.
OK, Dad?

17:00.896 --> 17:03.686
- No, I don't want that.
- But I do.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.815
A goalkeeper?
Are you joking or what?

17:07.819 --> 17:09.069
Go! Go!

17:10.030 --> 17:12.069
Great defense!

17:13.867 --> 17:18.906
Dad, I'm going to teach you
how to shoot a penalty.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.749
To shoot a penalty,
you place the ball here.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.665
But don't go too far away
because otherwise you won't score.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.046
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

17:27.172 --> 17:31.802
You have to shoot hard like this
so that you score.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.297
- Oh, really?
- Yes, but...

17:34.429 --> 17:39.309
- Will you teach me how to do it later?
- Yes. When you're a player...

17:39.434 --> 17:42.234
- What?
- You'll see when we play football.

17:42.354 --> 17:43.774
- Are you going to teach me?
- Yes.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.124
Football has always been my passion.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.078
It was always
what I enjoyed doing the most.

18:30.611 --> 18:33.111
I was born on the island of Madeira;

18:33.197 --> 18:36.277
more specifically in the
neighborhood of Quinta Falcão.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.488
I wanted to be someone in football.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.629
I started playing football at Andorinha.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.214
At the time, my father
was Andorinha's kit man.

18:51.340 --> 18:54.050
I stayed at Andorinha for a couple
of years. Then I went to Nacional.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.216
It was one of the best teams in Madeira.

18:57.054 --> 18:59.604
And then I went to Sporting,

18:59.723 --> 19:02.603
leaving Madeira at the age of 12
and going to Lisbon,

19:02.726 --> 19:05.226
a different city, the capital.

19:06.230 --> 19:10.860
I remember leaving home.
My siblings were crying, my mother...

19:10.984 --> 19:13.744
Even my father
was more emotional that day.

19:13.862 --> 19:17.372
But they knew that it was
an opportunity I wanted in life.

19:20.494 --> 19:23.914
At Sporting, we were happy
to find a new family.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.752
There were many footballers
with plenty of talent.

19:27.876 --> 19:30.706
But Cristiano had something special.

19:30.838 --> 19:31.918
He did different things.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.917
He was never satisfied
with the amount he did.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.839
He always wanted more.

21:25.786 --> 21:28.706
It's the most expensive transfer ever
for a kid his age,

21:28.830 --> 21:30.330
around 15 million euros.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.497
On Manchester's website,
they say 17.3 million.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.786
I don't understand why it's different.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.840
Probably it went to his manager.

21:36.964 --> 21:39.094
It's one more victory
for manager Jorge Mendes.

21:39.216 --> 21:41.676
This was Jorge Mendes's big season.

21:44.847 --> 21:47.927
Tiago, it's Jorge Mendes
from Gestifute speaking. Good evening.

21:48.058 --> 21:49.348
I'm in Madrid.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.602
We have to meet up.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.308
One of these days
we'll go out for lunch.

21:53.397 --> 21:55.607
Jorge Mendes is one of
the most important businessmen

21:55.732 --> 21:56.822
in Portuguese football.

21:56.942 --> 21:59.742
He represents big names like
Cristiano Ronaldo and José Mourinho.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.740
Jorge Mendes is a super-agent, with
a group of footballers and coaches

22:03.866 --> 22:06.326
worth more than 650 million euros.

22:06.451 --> 22:09.081
The businessman does business
with all the big names in Europe

22:09.204 --> 22:11.214
and represents Mourinho,
Ronaldo, Nani

22:11.331 --> 22:14.501
as well as many other names from
Portuguese and international football.

22:15.043 --> 22:18.463
OK, very good. Very good.

22:19.464 --> 22:22.344
I met Jorge when I was 16...

22:24.094 --> 22:27.394
...and that's when practically
everything began.

22:34.479 --> 22:37.769
I felt a great empathy with him
right from the very first moment.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.990
Right to this day, everything Jorge
said would happen has happened.

25:00.626 --> 25:02.876
Little Jorge. Dance!

25:03.712 --> 25:05.632
Hold on! Come here.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.540
Shall we go home?

25:37.204 --> 25:38.754
Let's go home.

25:38.872 --> 25:40.042
Straighten his feet.

25:40.165 --> 25:42.745
- Put him in the back.
- C'mon, son, go in the back.

25:42.876 --> 25:45.206
- Open it.
- It's open.

25:45.337 --> 25:47.667
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow, Mum.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.168
I have limpets at home for you.

25:49.299 --> 25:50.839
I'll tell Henrique
to come and get them.

25:50.968 --> 25:53.798
- OK, and can he cook them?
- I'll tell him to cook them.

25:53.929 --> 25:56.009
You need to explain to him how to do it.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.179
Hi, how are you?

25:57.307 --> 25:59.227
- Fine. You?
- Fine.

26:04.356 --> 26:08.486
Hi, how are you?
Fine, and you?

26:23.333 --> 26:26.423
Look, Daddy's going to make a drink.
Do you want to try a little bit?

26:26.962 --> 26:30.382
- No.
- No? OK. Then I'll do it just for me.

26:30.507 --> 26:33.467
Alright?
Or do you not want a little bit?

26:33.594 --> 26:36.514
- Just a little bit.
- A little bit for me.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.348
Just a little bit for you to try.

26:38.473 --> 26:41.853
Yes. I want the Portug... No...

26:41.977 --> 26:44.687
- The Ferrari one?
- Yes, because it's mine.

26:44.813 --> 26:46.613
The Ferrari one.

26:50.194 --> 26:51.654
See if you like it.

26:52.446 --> 26:55.316
That's for you to become very strong!
Look at Daddy's arm, look.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.330
Don't you want to be big like Daddy?

26:59.620 --> 27:00.830
Huh?

27:02.039 --> 27:03.419
Oh, wow!

27:08.962 --> 27:10.632
It's very good.

27:11.298 --> 27:12.508
Come on. Finish painting

27:12.633 --> 27:15.343
so we can go and play football.
Come on.

27:16.637 --> 27:18.097
It's nearly done.

27:18.222 --> 27:20.522
You like it, huh?

27:22.100 --> 27:23.640
Good.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.978
You will be... Whoa!

27:27.814 --> 27:31.034
- You're going to be very strong!
- Touch it.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.073
That's it. Look at the ball.

27:34.238 --> 27:36.698
I tricked you.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.413
That's it.

27:38.534 --> 27:39.914
That's it.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.658
Now it's bedtime.

27:44.373 --> 27:46.083
Come. This way.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.748
To your bed!

27:53.423 --> 27:58.853
Give Daddy a kiss.
Sleep well. Give Daddy a hug.

28:01.682 --> 28:03.682
Come on. Let's go.

28:04.935 --> 28:07.695
Wait! Let me take out the blankets.

28:08.230 --> 28:09.610
Go.

28:12.025 --> 28:15.065
Bye. See you later.

28:34.590 --> 28:38.470
There are twelve days remaining until
Portugal's first game at the World Cup

28:38.594 --> 28:41.224
and the main concern
for the Portuguese football team

28:41.346 --> 28:44.306
is the most famous acronym
in the world... CR7.

28:44.725 --> 28:47.195
Cristiano Ronaldo
has a physical problem.

28:47.311 --> 28:50.731
He is limited by injuries
to his thigh and knee.

28:52.733 --> 28:55.403
Portugal's going to win the World Cup!

29:01.658 --> 29:05.658
Before the Champions League,
with 15 days to go, I was injured.

29:07.331 --> 29:09.081
I think it was an accumulation.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.875
Every year I play more than 60 games.

29:13.337 --> 29:17.877
Either you stop for two or three months
or you learn to live with the pain

29:18.008 --> 29:20.468
and have the psychological strength
to endure it.

29:34.942 --> 29:39.032
I can endure the pain because I think
there's something stronger.

29:39.154 --> 29:43.624
Maybe if I didn't feel the pain,
maybe I wouldn't be as good as I am.

29:54.419 --> 29:57.009
Give us a smile! Give us a smile!

30:03.095 --> 30:04.515
Hello?

30:11.812 --> 30:14.192
Are you joking or what?

30:19.945 --> 30:20.955
Yes?

30:21.071 --> 30:22.411
- Hello?
- Yes.

30:22.531 --> 30:23.701
- Hello.
- Yes, Mum.

30:23.824 --> 30:26.914
- You don't have any network, Ronaldo.
- Mum, I'm inside the hotel.

30:27.035 --> 30:29.825
You don't want me to go out to
the woods to find a network, do you?

30:29.955 --> 30:32.835
OK. OK. Call me when you have signal.

30:32.916 --> 30:34.286
Will do. OK.

30:34.418 --> 30:37.588
- Here, Ronaldo. Talk to your father!
- Hello, Daddy!

30:37.713 --> 30:40.383
- Send kisses.
- Kisses.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.967
- Say "Go, Portugal!"
- Go, Portugal!

30:43.093 --> 30:44.763
I love you very much.

30:44.887 --> 30:48.257
Daddy loves you very much too, son.
Kisses.

30:49.266 --> 30:51.386
- Kisses.
- Bye.

30:52.102 --> 30:53.352
- Bye.
- Bye.

31:42.694 --> 31:44.784
Cristiano, are you
feeling 100 percent now?

31:44.905 --> 31:47.705
99.9 percent.

32:15.602 --> 32:17.652
OK. This part's cool.

32:26.154 --> 32:27.864
And...

32:48.677 --> 32:50.967
It's Cristiano's favorite color.

33:21.210 --> 33:23.000
I love you, Daddy.

33:24.129 --> 33:26.719
When are you coming back?

33:29.426 --> 33:31.176
It's now. It's now.

33:37.851 --> 33:42.731
Beautiful! A round of applause.
Beautiful!

33:49.905 --> 33:52.245
Wherever the national team goes,

33:52.366 --> 33:54.236
all the attention
is on Cristiano Ronaldo.

33:54.368 --> 33:57.908
Naturally, we're talking
about the best player in the world.

33:58.038 --> 34:03.078
Cristiano Ronaldo says he feels
99.9 percent ready for the World Cup.

34:03.210 --> 34:05.340
CR7 left for Campinas in a good mood.

34:05.462 --> 34:07.302
Cristiano Ronaldo
shows that he's confident.

34:07.422 --> 34:11.052
He's not afraid of using the leg
that's fragile at the moment.

34:11.134 --> 34:13.804
We need to remember
it's patella tendonitis...

34:13.929 --> 34:17.849
Gaspar. Gaspar.
Did you bring the ice?

34:18.516 --> 34:19.766
Gaspar, I'm talking to you.

34:19.893 --> 34:24.652
Why are you asking now we're on the bus
rather than outside?

34:25.148 --> 34:27.398
He forgot about you yesterday
and forgot about me today.

34:27.525 --> 34:29.146
Honestly, Gaspar!

34:29.277 --> 34:30.737
If it had been Cristiano asking,

34:30.862 --> 34:32.703
he'd bring a suitcase full of ice.
A suitcase!

34:39.079 --> 34:42.079
There couldn't be more at stake
for Ronaldo and the Portuguese team.

34:42.165 --> 34:44.824
It's going to be essential for Ronaldo
to do well in this World Cup

34:44.960 --> 34:47.670
if he's to retain his Ballon d'Or.

35:23.957 --> 35:26.127
Let's go!

35:26.543 --> 35:28.253
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

35:28.837 --> 35:30.957
- The ball, the ball... Ball.
- Ball.

35:31.131 --> 35:32.841
Let's crush them!

35:32.966 --> 35:34.836
Go, go, go, go, go!

35:35.677 --> 35:37.967
Let's go!
Let's believe we are a great team.

35:38.138 --> 35:39.558
Let's go!

35:49.358 --> 35:53.448
No. He has the telephone number
of the agent.

35:53.737 --> 35:56.197
Don't worry! He will take
care of everything.

35:56.323 --> 35:58.873
The match is going to start
in half an hour.

36:47.040 --> 36:50.540
Any other player would not have
played in the World Cup

36:50.669 --> 36:53.959
because Cristiano was in
no condition to play a World Cup.

36:55.799 --> 36:58.219
Everybody that I spoke to said,

36:58.302 --> 37:00.972
"He's going to put his career at risk."

37:01.096 --> 37:02.966
"He shouldn't play."

37:06.977 --> 37:08.807
It could have become a serious problem.

37:27.956 --> 37:31.076
It's over. It's over.

38:24.179 --> 38:26.849
Look here! It's time to wake up.

38:30.477 --> 38:33.477
Frustration starts kicking in
on the pitch.

38:33.605 --> 38:35.225
That's what happened.

38:35.357 --> 38:37.687
Frustration, being beaten four-nil,

38:37.901 --> 38:40.781
starting the World Cup
in the worst possible way.

38:40.904 --> 38:42.954
It was the worst thing
that could have happened to us.

38:52.165 --> 38:55.245
We hadn't met people's expectations,

38:55.377 --> 38:57.087
what the Brazilian people
helped us with.

38:57.212 --> 38:58.882
I think we couldn't
give it back to them.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.870
Look at that. Look!

39:27.993 --> 39:29.583
He reacted quickly.

39:29.703 --> 39:31.663
Let her go, man! Let her go!

39:34.917 --> 39:35.957
Let her go!

39:39.463 --> 39:41.263
She was at the hotel waiting
for you yesterday.

39:41.381 --> 39:42.761
- This girl?
- Yes, the same one.

39:42.883 --> 39:46.723
- I didn't see her.
- Cristiano, she jumped this fence.

39:46.845 --> 39:48.425
Yes, security told me.

39:48.555 --> 39:51.135
We'll meet her in a bit.
She's fine physically.

39:51.266 --> 39:53.436
She must be physically fit
to be able to jump this fence.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.060
- And you? Are you physically fit?
- Everything's fine.

39:56.188 --> 39:58.268
- Everything? A hundred percent?
- A hundred percent.

39:58.398 --> 40:00.188
Thanks, Cristiano Ronaldo.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.820
Don't they want to talk to me as well?

40:12.120 --> 40:15.170
Thank you for everything.

40:15.916 --> 40:18.336
Thank you for everything.

40:21.713 --> 40:23.013
I did it!

40:23.131 --> 40:24.921
- You did?
- I did.

40:25.050 --> 40:27.970
- What did Cristiano tell you?
- He knows I exist.

40:28.095 --> 40:34.315
He asked me to stay calm
and stop crying, to take care.

40:34.434 --> 40:38.814
He asked what my name is
and I asked him to follow me on Twitter.

41:02.796 --> 41:05.086
- Three times a day...
- Don't exceed three per day.

41:05.215 --> 41:07.795
- Can I take one now?
- Yes, you can.

41:07.926 --> 41:09.136
- At night?
- Exactly.

41:09.261 --> 41:10.471
OK. And tomorrow?

41:10.554 --> 41:14.064
If you want to, take it when
you're feeling too anxious like now.

41:14.183 --> 41:17.943
I'm going to take one now because
I'm already feeling agitated. OK.

41:18.061 --> 41:19.231
- OK?
- OK.

41:21.648 --> 41:24.648
- Hello?
- What's up, Maria? How's everything?

41:25.903 --> 41:27.903
Have you taken the sedatives?

41:28.030 --> 41:30.820
- Have you taken the sedatives?
- What?

41:30.949 --> 41:33.829
Have you taken the sedatives?
Take it easy. It's only a game.

41:33.952 --> 41:38.872
Don't be upset, and don't stress out
because it'll go well.

41:38.999 --> 41:40.499
It'll go well, God willing.

41:40.584 --> 41:42.924
Take it easy! Don't be upset!
It's only a game...

41:43.045 --> 41:45.305
It's only a football game,
not a matter of life and death.

41:45.422 --> 41:48.802
- No one's going to die!
- OK, but... We have to win!

41:48.926 --> 41:52.096
OK. But take it easy. No worries.
No worries. No worries.

41:53.555 --> 41:55.265
OK, then. A kiss, Mum. Bye. Bye.

42:02.648 --> 42:03.688
Carla?

42:03.815 --> 42:06.185
My young man is looking beautiful,
isn't he?

42:06.318 --> 42:08.318
- Both of them!
- Ha! No, the little one.

42:08.445 --> 42:09.735
I'm talking about the little one.

42:14.284 --> 42:18.874
And so, tomorrow... Are you ready
to watch the World Cup game?

42:18.997 --> 42:21.207
I am, but it's always that thing

42:21.333 --> 42:25.963
and it's a match we have to win.

42:26.088 --> 42:28.128
- Of course.
- We have to win.

42:30.551 --> 42:33.971
And you see, being old,
I get more nervous.

42:34.096 --> 42:36.636
- No, you're not...
- It's true. It's true.

42:36.765 --> 42:40.435
I think that when I was younger,
I dealt with it better,

42:40.561 --> 42:43.611
whether they won or lost.
But not now. I suffer more now.

42:43.730 --> 42:46.730
But, Dolores, you must be used to
watching your son's matches by now.

42:46.859 --> 42:52.569
Yes, but when it comes
to special matches, it's different.

43:21.977 --> 43:25.647
This is the second game for Portugal
in the group stage facing the USA.

43:25.772 --> 43:29.612
They need to win after their awful
performance against Germany.

43:31.945 --> 43:36.445
She lives my world as well.
She lives my joy. She lives my sadness.

43:36.617 --> 43:38.987
It's as if she plays football
and not me.

43:43.040 --> 43:47.630
I often say there are times
when my mother looks older

43:48.337 --> 43:49.497
because of football.

43:50.464 --> 43:52.514
Goal!

43:56.220 --> 43:58.260
Goal!

44:05.187 --> 44:10.227
Portugal! Portugal!
Portugal!

44:20.869 --> 44:27.039
It's quite complicated for a mother
to watch a son who needs to win.

44:32.214 --> 44:35.684
I get sad.
I get worried.

44:36.218 --> 44:38.258
And I suffer a lot.

44:44.726 --> 44:48.686
When he gets hit,
it's like they hit me as well.

44:49.147 --> 44:51.317
Because I've always
liked football a lot,

44:51.441 --> 44:54.191
I wanted to have a son
who'd be a great player.

44:56.530 --> 44:59.120
But I never thought in my life

44:59.241 --> 45:02.451
that I'd have a son
who'd be a professional player

45:02.953 --> 45:05.623
and be the best in the world.

45:08.500 --> 45:10.710
Go! Go! Go! Goal!

45:11.044 --> 45:12.214
Dinis, be quiet!

45:12.337 --> 45:14.127
Go! Go! Go!

45:17.801 --> 45:19.551
Now's the time. Score now, Ronaldo!

45:19.928 --> 45:20.968
No. I'm going outside.

45:21.096 --> 45:22.756
No. No. No.

45:34.401 --> 45:36.611
- Pass me my flip-flops.
- But it's not... It's over now!

45:36.737 --> 45:38.407
OK. But pass me my flip-flops!

45:39.740 --> 45:42.580
I'm going on my own.
I'm going for a walk.

45:43.535 --> 45:46.155
Oh, Ronaldo! Damn it!

46:04.765 --> 46:08.395
I risked sending my son to Lisbon
when he was 12 years old

46:08.519 --> 46:10.399
which wasn't easy at all.

46:12.231 --> 46:18.651
I felt like I was abandoning him,
but it was for a good reason.

46:20.239 --> 46:23.279
Because I worked hard
to raise four children.

46:23.408 --> 46:26.948
But he was an unwanted child,

46:27.704 --> 46:31.124
but that son gave me so much joy.

46:34.795 --> 46:37.925
All that I have I owe to that son.

47:08.287 --> 47:11.247
However many people turn up, you'll
always be well received, won't you?

47:11.373 --> 47:13.123
Is that taxi over there available?

47:13.250 --> 47:16.840
- A photo with you, please?
- The first one, yeah?

47:16.920 --> 47:18.340
We had arrived in Portugal.

47:18.463 --> 47:22.053
I didn't say anything to anyone,
got in a taxi and went to the hotel

47:22.176 --> 47:26.846
because the next day I wanted to leave.
I wanted to go away on holiday.

47:37.149 --> 47:38.649
I didn't even want to go to Portugal.

47:38.775 --> 47:41.605
I didn't want to come to Spain.
I wanted to travel.

47:41.737 --> 47:45.777
I wanted to go anywhere else
where I wouldn't follow it,

47:45.908 --> 47:47.528
because I was sad.

47:51.371 --> 47:54.001
I have no doubt that
the World Cup made my injury worse.

47:54.124 --> 47:56.884
I feel sad.
I feel that things are not flowing.

47:57.002 --> 47:59.462
I don't feel any improvement
in my injury.

48:01.423 --> 48:03.473
I could have recovered by now.

48:03.592 --> 48:08.012
If I could go back,
I wouldn't have gone to the World Cup.

49:58.373 --> 49:59.543
Are you playing?

49:59.666 --> 50:02.376
- It's looking hard, isn't it?
- It's you.

50:03.170 --> 50:05.380
You're well trained.

50:06.131 --> 50:08.631
I'm seeing if I'm lucky enough
to be able to pay you the 40 euros.

50:08.759 --> 50:10.259
What do you mean?

50:10.385 --> 50:12.295
You're almost like
Cristiano "King" Ronaldo.

50:12.429 --> 50:15.519
Nah, not yet.
There's still a long way to go.

50:15.641 --> 50:17.641
But it's getting better.

50:18.393 --> 50:20.853
So you're pleased! Come on. Sit here.

50:22.022 --> 50:23.362
I have to watch it, don't I?

50:24.024 --> 50:25.484
It's only us two, right?

50:25.609 --> 50:27.149
What's the suit?

50:28.070 --> 50:29.450
- Spades, spades, spades.
- No, no.

50:29.571 --> 50:30.571
Which one was it?

50:30.697 --> 50:32.697
It's spades! Watch out for the game
or you'll lose.

51:11.238 --> 51:16.738
Five, six, seven,

51:17.995 --> 51:19.705
eight...

51:19.913 --> 51:23.963
- Three...
- Four, five, six, seven.

51:27.004 --> 51:28.004
That's it.

51:28.380 --> 51:33.130
Ten! One, two,
three, four, five...

51:34.094 --> 51:38.104
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

51:39.474 --> 51:41.484
That's it. Get off.

51:41.852 --> 51:44.772
Look. It's a draw, the game.
We both won.

51:44.980 --> 51:46.770
We'll do the rest this afternoon,
alright?

51:46.899 --> 51:49.819
Give me a snuggle and a kiss.
Give me a hug, my darling.

51:57.201 --> 51:59.371
I consider myself to be
an isolated person.

51:59.494 --> 52:01.544
I know what's best for me.

52:01.663 --> 52:03.123
And the best for me is

52:03.207 --> 52:07.377
I come home,
completely disconnect from the world,

52:07.503 --> 52:11.553
media, television, football

52:11.673 --> 52:16.683
because I know that the next day I'll be
pulled back into that world again.

52:17.429 --> 52:19.969
I like to be quiet.
I like not feeling pressure

52:20.390 --> 52:22.060
after training, after the games.

52:22.184 --> 52:24.984
I like to enter my world.
I am at home.

52:25.187 --> 52:27.187
I'm with the people I like.
I'm with my son.

52:27.314 --> 52:29.234
And I am at peace with myself.

52:47.417 --> 52:49.587
I have everything.
There's nothing that I don't have.

52:49.711 --> 52:51.921
But people are always waiting
for me to make a mistake,

52:52.047 --> 52:56.047
to accuse me, to criticize me.
It's difficult. It's very difficult.

53:24.246 --> 53:26.786
Wait. Wait. I can see him.
I can see him.

53:29.751 --> 53:33.341
I think I will always be observed
in a different way.

53:33.463 --> 53:37.053
But that's part of what I have
achieved in the world of football.

53:37.217 --> 53:41.137
Maybe when I end my career,
things will become quieter.

53:52.691 --> 53:55.611
What name have you chosen
for this baby?

53:55.736 --> 53:57.236
Hugo Tomas.

53:57.821 --> 54:00.241
Are you aware that you are
obliged to educate him in the faith

54:00.365 --> 54:03.115
so this child can keep
God's commandments?

54:03.243 --> 54:04.243
Yes.

54:04.369 --> 54:09.789
And you, the godparents, are you willing
to help his parents in this task?

54:09.917 --> 54:10.917
Yes.

54:11.043 --> 54:14.963
Hugo Tomas, the Christian community
receives you with great joy.

54:15.088 --> 54:17.798
I do the Cross on you as a sign
of Christ the Savior.

54:27.184 --> 54:28.774
The celebration has concluded.

54:29.436 --> 54:33.266
Congratulations on the new Christian
in your home.

54:34.107 --> 54:37.607
And one last thing, later, outside,
if you don't mind,

54:37.736 --> 54:40.776
take a selfie with me. OK?

54:48.789 --> 54:50.539
Have a picture together. Go.

55:28.036 --> 55:30.246
Cristiano Ronaldo has lost his father.

55:30.372 --> 55:33.632
Dinis Aveiro leaves our world
at the age of 53.

55:33.750 --> 55:36.670
His condition deteriorated
in the month of July.

55:36.795 --> 55:41.585
Cristiano Ronaldo booked an air
ambulance to take his dad to London,

55:41.717 --> 55:45.347
but his kidneys and liver
couldn't hold out any longer.

56:01.820 --> 56:04.990
Ronaldo's father drank a lot.

56:05.532 --> 56:10.412
He had cirrhosis
and he died due to drinking.

56:13.582 --> 56:16.382
Ronaldo did everything
he could to save his father,

56:16.460 --> 56:18.670
but he couldn't.

56:24.134 --> 56:29.894
I think it was because he joined
the Portuguese Colonial War in Angola

56:30.015 --> 56:36.395
and he returned angry
because of the war.

56:36.480 --> 56:40.860
And when he came back,
he felt very angry

56:40.984 --> 56:45.034
and although he never mistreated
his children, he never did,

56:45.155 --> 56:47.235
I became his victim.

56:52.746 --> 56:57.996
My father, he was very funny
when he was drunk.

56:59.211 --> 57:02.341
He used to tell a lot of stories.
He used to sing.

57:02.464 --> 57:04.224
He was funny.

57:09.763 --> 57:11.893
He was drunk nearly every day.

57:12.015 --> 57:13.595
And when that happens,

57:13.725 --> 57:18.555
it's not easy to have a conversation
to get to know my father a bit more.

57:19.439 --> 57:20.979
I'm not ashamed to say it.

57:21.108 --> 57:25.238
I didn't really get to know
my father for real, from the heart,

57:25.362 --> 57:27.862
to open up and tell him things.

57:27.990 --> 57:30.120
I never had those kinds of
conversations with him.

57:33.704 --> 57:38.044
If you ask me why my father
became an alcoholic, I don't know.

57:40.460 --> 57:42.840
Maybe he was frustrated with life.

57:42.963 --> 57:45.223
I don't know.
I don't know and I don't care.

57:47.759 --> 57:49.219
I feel some frustration

57:49.344 --> 57:53.854
because obviously I wanted
a different father,

57:53.974 --> 57:57.774
a dad who could be more present
to see my achievements.

57:59.563 --> 58:01.903
That's what frustrates me the most.

58:02.024 --> 58:05.864
The fact that he can't see
all my successes as a player,

58:05.986 --> 58:09.026
as a person, as a father as well.

58:09.907 --> 58:15.247
But I think that I managed
to handle things in his absence.

58:15.996 --> 58:17.996
Give me five!

58:18.248 --> 58:20.668
Ah! You tricked me.

58:32.513 --> 58:34.763
Cristiano Ronaldo
has become the father of a boy.

58:34.890 --> 58:40.060
The news was announced by the footballer
himself on Facebook and Twitter.

58:40.187 --> 58:43.267
The Portuguese international
doesn't reveal the mother's name

58:43.398 --> 58:46.648
and says he'll have
sole custody of the child.

58:47.528 --> 58:53.618
Ronaldo announced the birth of his son
first in English and then in Portuguese

58:53.742 --> 58:55.412
so there were no remaining doubts.

58:55.536 --> 58:58.286
But as for the mother's identity,
not a word.

58:58.413 --> 59:01.793
Irina Shayk is Cristiano Ronaldo's
current girlfriend,

59:01.917 --> 59:06.837
but everything suggests that the son
is from a previous relationship.

59:07.381 --> 59:11.551
For two hours the reporters waited
for a glimpse of the idol and his son.

59:11.677 --> 59:14.547
It was only CR7, who left his house

59:14.638 --> 59:17.968
to say that he was happy
but upset at the same time.

59:18.141 --> 59:21.641
I'm happy, but you disappoint me.
You're always here disturbing me.

59:21.770 --> 59:24.730
Always walking around the house.
And you make me upset by doing this.

59:24.857 --> 59:28.567
Regarding the mystery surrounding
little CR's mother, not a single word.

59:28.652 --> 59:30.742
Are you going to announce
anything else about the child?

59:30.863 --> 59:31.993
What do you mean?

59:32.114 --> 59:34.414
The big question we all have basically
is if the child was...

59:34.575 --> 59:38.955
That's pointless. That's pointless.
It's pointless to ask because...

59:39.079 --> 59:40.659
Was it done at a clinic?

59:40.789 --> 59:43.669
Don't go there. It's pointless.
I've said everything I have to say.

59:43.792 --> 59:46.042
I'd like you to give me some privacy.

59:46.461 --> 59:50.091
You can color it here, here, here...

59:50.215 --> 59:51.755
- OK?
- OK.

59:53.760 --> 59:57.600
I always had this dream
of having a son

59:58.682 --> 01:00:00.892
to be my successor.

01:00:03.061 --> 01:00:05.401
I wanted to be a young father,
and I was.

01:00:05.606 --> 01:00:07.356
I was 25.

01:00:07.482 --> 01:00:10.782
Because I wanted to be able
to follow him

01:00:10.986 --> 01:00:13.946
during his development
as a person, as a man.

01:00:14.072 --> 01:00:15.622
That was always a dream of mine.

01:00:22.456 --> 01:00:26.126
Obviously, Cristiano has been
a big influence on me.

01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:31.338
I have learnt to be calmer,
more cautious.

01:00:31.465 --> 01:00:33.805
I have learnt a lot
about being a father.

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:41.636
People speculate that it was
with this girl or the other,

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:45.225
or a surrogate mother.
I've never told anyone and never will.

01:00:45.354 --> 01:00:47.154
I think I should keep that to myself.

01:00:47.272 --> 01:00:51.942
And later, when Cristiano is grown up,
then I will talk to him

01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:56.949
and tell him what I did, what I felt,
everything that went through my mind.

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:01.833
Some kids never get to know
their parents,

01:01:01.954 --> 01:01:05.924
neither father nor mother.
Having a father is good enough.

01:01:11.004 --> 01:01:14.724
I don't care what other people say.
It doesn't bother me.

01:01:14.842 --> 01:01:20.682
I always thought, and still think,
that he will understand me.

01:01:29.273 --> 01:01:30.573
I can't believe it!

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:33.608
I can't believe it!

01:01:33.986 --> 01:01:37.196
He doesn't have anybody
apart from his father and me,

01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:41.032
and so he does spend
a lot of time with me.

01:01:42.035 --> 01:01:43.695
Now how is he going to score?

01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:49.538
Pass! Pass it forward!

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:51.420
I'm not bothered
about who the mother is.

01:01:51.545 --> 01:01:54.715
I just want to give my grandson love

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:59.640
and educate him as Ronaldo asked me to,

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:01.763
as I did for him.

01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:04.059
He reminds me of Ronaldo
when he was a child

01:02:04.183 --> 01:02:07.273
and I see little Cristiano
just like his dad.

01:02:07.603 --> 01:02:09.193
Goal!

01:02:09.897 --> 01:02:11.227
Daddy!

01:02:12.858 --> 01:02:14.528
Great!

01:02:15.152 --> 01:02:17.782
Look, it was Daddy!

01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:49.309
Cristiano shoots and... Goal!

01:02:49.686 --> 01:02:52.186
The winner of the Ballon d'Or!

01:02:52.314 --> 01:02:57.994
- The best player of last season!
- Goal! Goal! Goal!

01:03:09.581 --> 01:03:12.581
Goal! Goal! Goal!

01:03:28.809 --> 01:03:32.899
Cristiano scores
his 11th goal of the season.

01:03:49.454 --> 01:03:54.214
The goal record of Cristiano Ronaldo
is astonishing,

01:03:54.334 --> 01:03:56.544
even surpassing the total
number of goals

01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:00.470
scored by some teams
in the Spanish league.

01:04:00.591 --> 01:04:02.591
Hat trick for Cristiano Ronaldo.

01:04:02.718 --> 01:04:06.848
It's his 13th goal in the league
in only seven matches.

01:04:23.322 --> 01:04:26.912
You have to show yourself
that you really are good.

01:04:28.202 --> 01:04:29.952
That's always my priority,

01:04:30.078 --> 01:04:32.958
to prove to myself
that I still have the ability,

01:04:33.874 --> 01:04:38.294
that I can do better things,
wanting to win more than other people,

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.420
demonstrating
that I'm better than others.

01:05:12.246 --> 01:05:14.906
Your son says that you're going
to score two goals.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.120
One for me and one for him.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:19.000
- Yes, yes. A dream.
- Yes. He said that to me.

01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:20.501
We'll win five-nil.

01:05:21.213 --> 01:05:22.383
God willing.

01:05:22.923 --> 01:05:26.013
Yes. Goodbye.
Speak soon. Kisses. Speak soon.

01:05:26.218 --> 01:05:28.138
Bye. Bye. Bye.

01:05:28.929 --> 01:05:30.719
Bye. Bye. Bye.

01:05:41.358 --> 01:05:43.108
The Ballon d'Or is obvious.

01:05:43.235 --> 01:05:45.705
I don't need to ask your opinion.

01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:47.951
But you'll be there on January 12th.

01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:51.831
Are you expecting an emotional reaction
from Cristiano Ronaldo if he wins?

01:05:51.952 --> 01:05:54.292
I can only tell you I don't know
what is going to happen.

01:05:54.413 --> 01:05:55.833
The only thing I can tell you

01:05:55.956 --> 01:05:59.036
is that there has never been
a year like this one.

01:05:59.168 --> 01:06:02.798
The difference between first and second
is so big that there is no doubt.

01:06:02.963 --> 01:06:04.553
And if Cristiano doesn't win,

01:06:04.673 --> 01:06:07.683
it would be best that
they stopped doing this event,

01:06:07.801 --> 01:06:12.641
that it didn't appear any longer
in the history of this trophy.

01:06:12.764 --> 01:06:14.974
Because the difference, truly,
is so great,

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.440
because it's not even worth
anyone asking,

01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:19.021
"Will it be A, B or C?"

01:06:19.146 --> 01:06:21.476
The difference is so great
that in the history of this trophy,

01:06:21.607 --> 01:06:27.317
there has never been so great
a difference as this year, 2014.

01:06:27.446 --> 01:06:30.526
The difference was an abyss,
and so there can only be one winner.

01:06:33.035 --> 01:06:35.045
Well, that's OK. I'll organize it.

01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:37.001
You're going crazy!

01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:40.501
No, no. I was talking to someone here.

01:06:40.626 --> 01:06:44.086
With the father of a footballer
who's going to be phenomenal.

01:06:44.213 --> 01:06:45.593
OK.

01:06:46.048 --> 01:06:49.718
It's an extra motivation
that he prods me all the time

01:06:49.843 --> 01:06:53.473
and always roots for me,
believing that I can always do better,

01:06:53.597 --> 01:06:55.637
believing that I can always
be even better.

01:06:55.766 --> 01:07:00.556
His desire to show the world
that I'm the best ever

01:07:00.687 --> 01:07:02.397
is a reason for happiness.

01:07:02.856 --> 01:07:06.026
He became an older brother.
He became a father.

01:07:07.444 --> 01:07:10.454
Jorge is another member of my family.

01:07:25.504 --> 01:07:28.474
I'm the brother
of the best footballer in the world

01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:32.390
and so I don't need anyone
to notice me. I don't need that.

01:07:34.429 --> 01:07:37.719
My father taught me
it's better to keep silent.

01:07:40.477 --> 01:07:43.937
My father used to say,
"A silent person wins more."

01:07:52.322 --> 01:07:56.372
If I applied myself and trained,
I'm sure I'd also be a footballer.

01:07:56.493 --> 01:07:57.583
I'm absolutely sure of it.

01:07:58.954 --> 01:08:00.834
I had some talent.

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:05.458
Ronaldo could have gone down
the wrong path.

01:08:05.586 --> 01:08:08.836
But he took the right path, and I was
happy that he chose that path,

01:08:08.964 --> 01:08:10.554
working to become a footballer.

01:08:17.598 --> 01:08:20.978
I've had issues with addiction.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.560
I was already drinking
at the age of 20.

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:30.359
I worked for a long time with my father.
I worked in construction.

01:08:31.236 --> 01:08:34.156
30 years ago,
everyone working in construction

01:08:34.281 --> 01:08:36.991
would drink alcohol. Everyone.

01:08:37.451 --> 01:08:42.211
I asked for help.
Then I had a relapse again.

01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:47.167
Then, on my own,
I told myself it was enough

01:08:47.294 --> 01:08:50.804
if I wanted to have a decent life
and if I didn't want to die young.

01:08:51.256 --> 01:08:55.046
I stopped, and until today,
my life's healthy. Thank God.

01:08:57.011 --> 01:09:00.522
From the day I pulled myself together,
Ronaldo has always helped me.

01:09:03.227 --> 01:09:06.437
We have to get away from people
who are always in trouble.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:13.488
Addictions, drugs and alcohol
won't get us anywhere.

01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:29.457
He knows that he made mistakes.

01:09:29.586 --> 01:09:34.466
He made some mistakes in life,
and he's the first to admit that

01:09:34.591 --> 01:09:36.890
and these are moments
he managed to overcome.

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:41.560
And so for me today, he's someone
that I trust with my projects.

01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:46.692
He owns my museum.
He's my right arm in many things.

01:09:46.812 --> 01:09:49.522
He's someone I will trust
for the rest of my days

01:09:49.648 --> 01:09:50.938
and he's a businessman.

01:09:54.736 --> 01:09:59.446
Like they say, if we won't help
our family, who will we help?

01:10:01.118 --> 01:10:03.078
He might have gone through a bad period,

01:10:03.203 --> 01:10:07.253
but God gave him a new start
which was having a perfect family.

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:13.460
Thank you, brother, for all you've done.

01:10:13.839 --> 01:10:18.429
Thank you, brother, for all you've done.

01:11:01.762 --> 01:11:04.512
I can't. I can't. I can't now.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.930
OK. OK.
Look! Do you know something?

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.480
Do you have any idea
what day it is today?

01:11:10.604 --> 01:11:13.824
Forget that! Call me after the game!
Call me after the game!

01:11:39.633 --> 01:11:40.883
Hello.

01:11:41.969 --> 01:11:43.679
Will you give your godfather a kiss?

01:11:44.763 --> 01:11:46.013
Who will win?

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:47.890
- Who will win?
- Madrid!

01:11:48.559 --> 01:11:50.689
- Madrid!
- Real Madrid.

01:11:50.811 --> 01:11:52.811
How many goals will Daddy score?

01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:55.647
Two? No, Four! Two is not enough.

01:11:55.774 --> 01:11:57.614
Four, four, four.

01:11:58.026 --> 01:11:59.686
At least four.

01:12:21.717 --> 01:12:23.337
I'm afraid of the other guy.

01:12:23.468 --> 01:12:26.468
He's the only one
who can win the Ballon d'Or. Huh?

01:12:26.597 --> 01:12:31.347
- The other guy could destroy everything.
- No. No, he won't.

01:13:42.673 --> 01:13:48.353
I think rivalry
is always created by the press.

01:13:53.725 --> 01:13:57.725
The relationship with Messi,
in the last year, was much better.

01:13:59.773 --> 01:14:02.323
We've spoken more about ourselves.

01:14:02.442 --> 01:14:03.862
He asked me about my injury,

01:14:03.986 --> 01:14:07.066
how my old injury was
from the World Cup,

01:14:07.197 --> 01:14:09.697
asking about the family...

01:14:12.536 --> 01:14:17.536
I looked at him not as a rival
but as a person

01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:20.878
who makes me a better player
and I make him a better player.

01:14:24.298 --> 01:14:29.048
We are always busting our balls
to see who's better.

01:15:03.962 --> 01:15:06.382
Penalty! Penalty! Penalty! Penalty!

01:15:06.507 --> 01:15:08.007
Penalty!

01:15:11.845 --> 01:15:14.255
Cristiano Ronaldo is at the ball.

01:15:14.389 --> 01:15:18.849
This is a spot
he hardly ever misses from.

01:15:20.812 --> 01:15:24.272
Cristiano shoots and goal!

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.440
An equalizer in El Clásico.

01:15:27.819 --> 01:15:29.199
16 goals for Cristiano in La Liga,

01:15:29.321 --> 01:15:31.241
and the fifth penalty
for the Portuguese player.

01:15:31.365 --> 01:15:33.325
They appear to be
on the best form ever.

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:36.580
Ronaldo and Real Madrid
are clearly imposing themselves

01:15:36.703 --> 01:15:38.833
in this match against Barcelona.

01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:45.671
Goal, Cristiano.

01:15:48.382 --> 01:15:51.302
The three points stay with Madrid
at the Bernabéu.

01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:55.846
Real Madrid and the fans celebrate
this very important victory

01:15:55.973 --> 01:15:59.983
for Carlo Ancelotti's team.
A three-one win.

01:16:00.102 --> 01:16:03.442
The local team, Real Madrid,
was undoubtedly better than Barcelona.

01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:05.864
It's a huge party here
at the Santiago Bernabéu.

01:16:23.292 --> 01:16:26.752
The people I trust the most
and that I feel the most...

01:16:26.879 --> 01:16:28.049
Esteem. Esteem.

01:16:28.172 --> 01:16:30.972
- Esteem and friendship for.
- And feel friendship for.

01:16:31.091 --> 01:16:33.471
If you want to talk, you can do it!

01:16:37.097 --> 01:16:40.477
But in fact the people I trust
the most are present here.

01:16:40.976 --> 01:16:44.646
I want that to be clear. It's true.
I'm saying it from the heart.

01:16:45.606 --> 01:16:46.896
I hope we can do this again

01:16:47.024 --> 01:16:50.034
because it'll mean we're happy
and things are...

01:16:50.152 --> 01:16:52.822
- And alive.
- Alive and doing well. Thank you, all.

01:16:52.946 --> 01:16:54.486
Well done!

01:16:55.532 --> 01:16:58.332
- To the best!
- Health!

01:16:58.452 --> 01:17:00.082
The best thing to do
is put all your money

01:17:00.204 --> 01:17:01.664
in that vault you have in your room.

01:17:01.788 --> 01:17:04.618
It doesn't fit.
Do you think it fits in there?

01:17:05.501 --> 01:17:08.041
Big Jorge!
We started from nothing.

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:12.010
Jorge, we started from nothing
and now...

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:18.430
Big Jorge didn't have anything either.
He went around selling videotapes and...

01:17:18.555 --> 01:17:20.805
- And playing music.
- And look at the man now.

01:17:20.933 --> 01:17:22.273
Straw hats.

01:17:22.392 --> 01:17:26.102
- And now he's always wearing Rolex.
- This one's a fake.

01:17:26.438 --> 01:17:29.518
I come from a good family.
They were just dirt poor.

01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:31.325
They were.

01:17:31.443 --> 01:17:33.493
- Old times!
- Great episodes.

01:17:33.654 --> 01:17:35.164
Great episodes lived with big Jorge.

01:17:41.161 --> 01:17:43.831
Now for the best one, Jorge.

01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:47.131
You need a drink.

01:17:52.005 --> 01:17:53.965
As for my friend Hugo,

01:17:54.091 --> 01:17:57.591
I still remember the past and things
that don't need to be talked about now.

01:17:57.719 --> 01:18:02.429
I'm proud of him because he
overcame his adversities.

01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:05.598
To think back then,
that we'd be here today,

01:18:05.727 --> 01:18:11.477
and you've got businesses in your hands

01:18:11.608 --> 01:18:17.948
and ambitions for a bright future
for you and your family.

01:18:18.073 --> 01:18:20.083
I'll give you a kiss.

01:18:24.204 --> 01:18:29.384
Now, after the mother I had,
you're the mother I'd like to have had.

01:18:37.092 --> 01:18:39.052
This is... This is...

01:18:39.178 --> 01:18:40.718
My special son.

01:18:41.138 --> 01:18:43.388
I don't need many words,
because he knows it.

01:18:43.515 --> 01:18:47.975
I live obsessed about him every day.
But he deserves it.

01:18:48.103 --> 01:18:51.153
It's not because...
You could not be everything you are.

01:18:51.273 --> 01:18:54.403
But I'll tell you something,
I fight for you every day.

01:18:54.526 --> 01:18:57.396
I feel very proud to be able
to fight for you every day.

01:18:57.529 --> 01:18:59.359
I want to do it with conviction.
You deserve it.

01:18:59.489 --> 01:19:02.239
You're a lot more
than I could ever do for you!

01:19:02.367 --> 01:19:03.827
It's nothing.

01:19:03.952 --> 01:19:07.502
In terms of your value,
I could do twice what I do.

01:19:07.623 --> 01:19:10.753
It'll never be enough
to be up to your level,

01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:14.884
your quality,
both human and sporting qualities.

01:19:15.005 --> 01:19:16.165
You're a monster!

01:19:16.298 --> 01:19:18.798
This is the best in the world,
the best footballer in the world.

01:19:18.926 --> 01:19:21.296
The best sportsman, I tell you.
And I mean it.

01:19:21.428 --> 01:19:23.298
There's really no doubt about it.

01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:27.270
He's the best in the world and everyone
will recognize that for sure.

01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:30.312
All the world. No one will be
indifferent to that.

01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:32.267
He's the best sportsman
in the world ever

01:19:32.397 --> 01:19:36.277
and I'm proud to be standing
next to a guy like this

01:19:36.401 --> 01:19:39.241
because it's a truly impressive thing!

01:19:42.115 --> 01:19:45.325
Oscar! Give him an Oscar!

01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:49.712
If I didn't know you,
I'd ask you for an autograph.

01:19:54.378 --> 01:19:57.168
- Jorge...
- You lost your glass somewhere.

01:19:57.297 --> 01:19:59.257
A toast to Jorge!

01:20:05.806 --> 01:20:07.306
Jorge is the best.

01:20:07.432 --> 01:20:09.182
Jorge. Top!

01:20:09.309 --> 01:20:10.689
Top, top, top.

01:20:44.052 --> 01:20:47.352
The Ballon d'Or is a day
when your heart beats faster.

01:20:48.098 --> 01:20:51.388
You sweat more. You're more anxious,

01:20:51.643 --> 01:20:55.193
more tired, both psychologically
and physically.

01:20:55.314 --> 01:20:56.904
It's a very intense day.

01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:02.859
My mother, my siblings,
I feel they were also very nervous.

01:21:02.988 --> 01:21:05.738
Even Jorge Mendes.
Everyone who was with me.

01:21:16.752 --> 01:21:18.002
It stays for life.

01:21:18.128 --> 01:21:22.548
People who like me,
the family, the fans,

01:21:22.674 --> 01:21:24.884
they never forget about it

01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:28.138
because it's the climax
of a year's work,

01:21:28.263 --> 01:21:31.683
of a career that started
when I was 11 years old,

01:21:31.808 --> 01:21:35.228
playing football always
with the goal of being the best,

01:21:35.687 --> 01:21:38.267
winning trophies, winning titles,

01:21:38.398 --> 01:21:42.028
having a good life, making money...

01:21:42.152 --> 01:21:45.742
Everything. It's all part
of the same package.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:52.910
It's a card inside an envelope
that can change so much.

01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:58.457
You're a chicken.

01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:07.641
My son accompanying his dad
and seeing with his own eyes

01:22:07.761 --> 01:22:09.971
the glories of his father,
that's unique.

01:22:10.931 --> 01:22:14.641
He's already proud of me.
He shows off my trophies.

01:22:15.435 --> 01:22:17.845
That makes me an even happier person.

01:22:18.772 --> 01:22:21.112
You're a clown!

01:22:22.234 --> 01:22:23.784
I'm the same as you.

01:22:23.944 --> 01:22:25.654
Let me see if your hands are cold.

01:22:26.613 --> 01:22:27.783
You're cold.

01:22:28.031 --> 01:22:31.371
I just had a shower
to wash bad luck away from my body.

01:22:31.493 --> 01:22:34.043
- To wash what?
- Bad luck.

01:22:35.205 --> 01:22:37.415
Come here. Take a photo
with me and Ronaldo, please.

01:22:41.879 --> 01:22:43.839
You need to be very well behaved

01:22:43.964 --> 01:22:47.264
otherwise Daddy won't buy you
anything tomorrow.

01:22:47.384 --> 01:22:49.514
Otherwise Daddy won't win.

01:22:49.636 --> 01:22:51.846
I always do. And will you cry?

01:22:51.972 --> 01:22:54.312
I will.
I'm always the first one to cry.

01:22:57.895 --> 01:23:01.275
- Why are they shouting?
- Because of the players.

01:23:01.398 --> 01:23:03.268
What did they call you
when you went outside?

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.530
Who's that guy there?
Who's that guy over there?

01:23:05.652 --> 01:23:08.492
The one wearing a suit. Who is it?

01:23:11.033 --> 01:23:12.203
Go on. Go on.

01:23:16.288 --> 01:23:18.118
Are you OK? Yes?

01:23:18.624 --> 01:23:20.634
High-five him.

01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:23.038
What's up? Are you well?

01:23:25.172 --> 01:23:26.672
Are you being shy now?

01:23:26.798 --> 01:23:28.048
He's shy now.

01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:31.802
Who's that?
He's being shy now.

01:23:31.929 --> 01:23:35.769
- Look at that shyness!
- He can't believe it's him!

01:23:36.183 --> 01:23:38.143
- It's Messi.
- Give Daddy a kiss.

01:23:38.268 --> 01:23:40.188
A kiss? Why?

01:23:42.606 --> 01:23:44.686
I'm always giving you kisses.

01:23:44.816 --> 01:23:47.066
He can't believe it.

01:23:47.194 --> 01:23:49.904
And why do you like playing football?

01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:02.711
Bye. Bye.

01:24:04.837 --> 01:24:05.957
Done.

01:24:47.296 --> 01:24:50.756
You'll see that I'll end up
without any teeth.

01:24:57.973 --> 01:24:59.183
Come here.

01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:12.951
Nearly there, nearly there...

01:25:13.113 --> 01:25:14.573
Wait!

01:25:22.289 --> 01:25:23.619
You see?

01:25:23.749 --> 01:25:25.419
Everything's possible.

01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:28.752
"And he was crazy for her!"

01:25:28.879 --> 01:25:31.049
Done!

01:25:40.849 --> 01:25:43.639
You're the best, man! The best!

01:26:27.354 --> 01:26:30.654
He was a child
that I wanted to abort.

01:26:30.774 --> 01:26:33.784
God didn't want that to happen,
and I was blessed because of that,

01:26:33.902 --> 01:26:35.572
and God did not punish me.

01:26:37.656 --> 01:26:41.486
Sometimes Ronaldo makes fun of me

01:26:41.618 --> 01:26:43.748
and says,
"You didn't want me to be born."

01:26:43.871 --> 01:26:48.631
"But now you see
that I'm here helping all of you."

01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:54.130
And, well, sometimes,
we have a laugh about that.

01:26:57.467 --> 01:27:00.097
It's like a family relationship.

01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:02.930
And after that, I'm passionate
about his game,

01:27:03.056 --> 01:27:06.806
about the way he plays,
the way he dedicates himself.

01:27:07.811 --> 01:27:10.271
I see Cristiano like a son,

01:27:10.397 --> 01:27:12.267
like a real son.

01:27:20.365 --> 01:27:23.275
I've lived life's sorrows,

01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:27.620
so did Ronaldo,
and life took a turn.

01:27:28.165 --> 01:27:30.255
It's been a journey.

01:27:30.334 --> 01:27:33.594
Life can really turn around.
The world is round.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.880
He's our protector
and he always helped us

01:27:38.008 --> 01:27:40.298
and everything we have today
we owe to him.

01:28:04.618 --> 01:28:06.198
He's going through
a great moment of fame.

01:28:06.328 --> 01:28:10.498
He is, these days.
I'm enjoying it greatly.

01:28:10.624 --> 01:28:13.634
- How does a father feel?
- He's really standing out.

01:28:13.752 --> 01:28:18.592
The father likes it.
It's always good. I feel emotional.

01:29:28.285 --> 01:29:31.415
