Yeah, this could be
the kind of payday I could use.

what everyone else knows.

Gotta be holed up somewhere, but no clue.

You haven't seen her in a while.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.040
You can give me a call
if she pops by again.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.640

is the Cedar Wood Retreat.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.120
That's really more of a rehab place.

Yeah, but for, like,

It's a little New Age for my blood.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.040

Yeah, you got no chance of that.

Uh, Kyle, that's my uncle,

He says someone hired the entire complex
for the weekend.

for, like, one person the whole time.

[Terry] It's good, right?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.360
Another satisfied victim.

34:19.440 --> 34:20.840
Goddamn, Jesse.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.120
Good to know.

34:22.200 --> 34:24.680
That's what you ought to call that,
"pecan perfection."

34:25.920 --> 34:28.720
I mean, the chicken was perfection.
The chicken was perfect.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.960
-It is so easy to screw up chicken.
-[Terry] Oh yeah.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.240
Not many people know this.

34:33.320 --> 34:36.360
They think, "Oh, well,
you just drop it in the deep fryer." No.

34:36.440 --> 34:40.080
It's not about frying chicken.
You're gonna sauté it, bake it…

34:40.160 --> 34:42.120
But it's gotta be done, you know…

34:42.840 --> 34:45.200
Because you undercook it, and, you know,

34:46.680 --> 34:47.680
people die.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.280
-[Bo panting]

[Terry] Are you okay? What--

34:54.840 --> 34:56.520
[grunting]

34:56.600 --> 34:57.520
What is--

34:57.600 --> 35:00.560
It could come in. It's out there!

35:01.160 --> 35:03.920
It could be coming this way!
We need to block the door!

35:04.000 --> 35:05.840
Ma'am. What has happened?

35:05.920 --> 35:08.120
-Ma'am, calm down.

-Fucking call for help!
-Calm down.

35:14.080 --> 35:17.760
Take a few deep breaths, settle down,
and explain to me what has happened.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.160
Then maybe we can figure out
how we're gonna move forward.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.320
[Bo] No, just please
fucking call for help!

35:22.400 --> 35:24.480
-[Clay] I will do that momentarily, ma'am.
-She's here.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.120
But first, I need to understand--

35:26.200 --> 35:27.520
No, no, no, no!

35:27.600 --> 35:30.480
-Okay, back up!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, Officer. Sir.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.440
-Stay down. Stay down.
-No, you don't under--

35:32.520 --> 35:35.120
Officer! Officer! It's out there, Officer!

35:35.200 --> 35:37.840
You need to call for backup, Office--

[Hector gurgles]

37:17.040 --> 37:17.920
[Mazey] Kill me.

37:33.960 --> 37:34.920
Please.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.400
Kill me.

Just… just shoot me.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.120
[somber music continues]

38:16.440 --> 38:18.440
[Mazey breathing heavily]

38:58.920 --> 39:00.920
