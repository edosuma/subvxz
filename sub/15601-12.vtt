12:03.333 --> 12:04.833
My private jet'll be there
waitin' for ya!

12:04.933 --> 12:05.467
- What?!?

12:05.567 --> 12:06.500
- Why?

12:06.600 --> 12:07.767
- My pilot's gonna
fly you to Mexico!

12:07.867 --> 12:08.833
Nobody can arrest
you down there!

12:08.933 --> 12:12.067
- We're not gonna
hide out in Mexico!

12:12.133 --> 12:14.867
- We're innocent!

12:14.967 --> 12:19.400
- There was nobody tryin'
to steal our car.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.333
- Oh good, well, you must have
scared away those thugs.

12:26.167 --> 12:29.200
- Uh... Officers, what brings
you here to Game Shakers?

12:29.300 --> 12:32.133
- We have reason to believe that
these girls gave the business

12:32.233 --> 12:35.833
owner next door a tainted pie.

12:35.933 --> 12:37.533
- Now look, officers, I'm--

12:37.633 --> 12:40.667
- Wait a sec, you're Double G!

12:40.767 --> 12:43.833
- Oh my God, you are Double G.

12:43.933 --> 12:47.700
- Aha, yeah, yeah,
I am a superstar.

12:47.800 --> 12:52.200
And I'm also business partners
with these two girls.

12:52.300 --> 12:55.100
And I can tell you,
they would no more break the law

12:55.200 --> 12:57.567
than I would. All right?

12:57.667 --> 12:59.867
Isn't that right, ladies?

13:00.067 --> 13:03.333
- Y'know... it's illegal
to land a helicopter

13:03.433 --> 13:05.633
on the roof of this building.

13:05.733 --> 13:07.300
- Oooh, I wasn't aware of that.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.800
- And uh, last January,
weren't you fined for bringing

13:09.900 --> 13:13.267
a wild tiger to
a children's hospital?

13:13.367 --> 13:16.067
- Oh, uh, you know about that?

13:16.100 --> 13:18.833
Uh, Babe, Kenzie,
I've helped you all I can.

13:18.933 --> 13:20.433
- You have to help us!!

13:20.533 --> 13:21.700
- Trip, come on.
We need to go talk.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.967
- Yes sir.

13:23.067 --> 13:25.733
- Hey, Officers, good luck
with your investigation!

13:25.833 --> 13:29.067
Ooh, that's nice on you.

13:32.433 --> 13:34.900
- Dad! Hold up!
We can't just leave.

13:35.067 --> 13:37.667
Babe and Kenzie and are
in a lot of trouble!

13:37.767 --> 13:39.833
- I know. That's why we're gonna
go to the business next door

13:39.933 --> 13:42.267
and poke around, so we can
prove the girls are innocent.

13:42.367 --> 13:43.300
- Ohhhh.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.200
- Now we need to figure
out what's--

13:47.300 --> 13:53.867
Oh! Hey Michelle,
what's goin' on, pretty girl?

13:53.967 --> 13:56.500
- Dad, you said we got to hurry!

13:56.600 --> 14:01.133
- Of course I remember
you, darlin'.

14:01.233 --> 14:04.067
- Excuse me, this is
Double G's girlfriend!

14:04.133 --> 14:07.467
You better never call my man
again unless your face

14:07.567 --> 14:09.767
wants to meet
the back of my hand!

14:09.867 --> 14:12.667
Now let's go next door!

14:12.767 --> 14:15.500
- Ahhh! You just like your mama!

14:21.433 --> 14:24.867
Hello gentlemen,
I'm Doctor Loeb.

14:24.967 --> 14:27.067
Are you here for
an ear cleansing?

14:27.133 --> 14:30.067
- Man, why you got them tubes
stuck up your nose?

14:30.100 --> 14:31.967
- Yes, well, I got
very sick yesterday,

14:32.067 --> 14:33.967
from eating a tainted pie.

14:34.067 --> 14:35.100
- Look...

14:35.200 --> 14:37.767
- Hey! Don't do that.

14:37.867 --> 14:39.867
- I painted this myself.

14:39.967 --> 14:41.833
- Jerrold!

14:41.933 --> 14:46.367
Go empty the wax vats,
and clean the turtle habitat.

14:46.467 --> 14:50.833
- I'm sorry. I'm worthless.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.400
- Yeah, it seems that way.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.500
- Let's have a look-see, hmm?

14:55.600 --> 14:58.200
- Oh. Yeah, sure.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.633
- Oh! My goodness.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.133
- What? What's wrong?

15:02.233 --> 15:03.833
- Son, you have incredibly
clean ear canals.

15:03.933 --> 15:06.300
- I do?

15:06.400 --> 15:11.067
- That's my son!
Clean ear canals!

15:11.100 --> 15:13.067
Check me, Doc, check me out.

15:13.100 --> 15:16.167
Yeah! I know they
clean, go ahead.

15:16.267 --> 15:17.633
- Oh good lord!

15:17.733 --> 15:18.467
- What?

15:18.567 --> 15:20.567
- It's nauseating in there.

15:20.667 --> 15:24.200
Here - boil this.
Then throw it away.

15:24.300 --> 15:29.067
- Maude! Lucius! Code green!

15:29.133 --> 15:30.367
- Wait, what's goin' on?

15:30.467 --> 15:33.600
We need to prep this man's
ears for deep suckage.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.167
- Deep what? Get your hands
off the superstar!

15:36.267 --> 15:37.067
- Uh, give us a minute.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.333
C'mere. You need to do this.

15:39.433 --> 15:40.600
- Why?

15:40.700 --> 15:41.900
- 'Cuz while they're suckin'
the goo outta your ears,

15:42.067 --> 15:44.767
I can check this place out.

15:44.867 --> 15:45.867
Uh, he's ready!

15:45.967 --> 15:48.600
- Excellent. Come along.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.767
- Hey! Don't be grabbin'
me like that, brother.

15:50.867 --> 15:55.233
- Look, we've answered all your
questions twenty times.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.633
- Yeah, what more do
you want from us?

16:01.267 --> 16:05.533
- All right. If you girls didn't
taint the pie...

16:05.633 --> 16:10.500
...then you won't
mind eating some.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.933
- Okay, I know this is
gonna sound weird...

16:14.067 --> 16:20.067
but seriously, I can't
eat peaches.

16:20.133 --> 16:22.233
They disgust me.

16:22.333 --> 16:25.167
- Do they disgust you too?

16:25.267 --> 16:29.633
- No. I'd love to eat some.

16:37.933 --> 16:41.800
- Eat it.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.367
- We're waiting.

16:44.467 --> 16:49.767
- Just... just gimme one sec.

16:55.667 --> 16:59.367
- Uh... I thought all
cops wore badges.

16:59.467 --> 17:01.800
- My badge is gone!

17:01.900 --> 17:04.067
- Yeah, mine too!

17:04.100 --> 17:07.067
- Lookin' for these?

17:11.367 --> 17:15.700
Later gators.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.633
- What's the matter with you?
Eat the stupid pie so they know

17:17.733 --> 17:18.867
we're innocent!

17:18.967 --> 17:19.367
- Babe.

17:19.467 --> 17:21.467
- What?

17:21.567 --> 17:22.900
What?!?

17:23.067 --> 17:25.067
- When we were making the pie,
I went to go get more peaches,

17:25.133 --> 17:28.700
and left you alone
to make the crust.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.133
- Yeah, so?

17:30.233 --> 17:31.733
- Babe.

17:31.833 --> 17:32.833
- What?

17:32.933 --> 17:34.233
- Did you put something
bad in the pie?

17:34.333 --> 17:37.067
- No! Oh my God, how could
you even ask me that?

17:37.133 --> 17:38.933
- You said you wanted revenge.

17:39.067 --> 17:40.967
- Well yeah but I'd never put
something bad in a pie

17:41.067 --> 17:43.200
to make someone sick!

17:43.300 --> 17:44.833
- Babe.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.200
- Dude!

17:46.300 --> 17:48.133
- Look, just tell me the truth
and I promise I won't drop

17:48.233 --> 17:49.967
dime on you.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.400
- What does that mean?

17:51.500 --> 17:52.967
- I won't tell the cops
that you tainted the pie.

17:53.067 --> 17:54.167
- I didn't!

17:54.267 --> 17:55.433
- Babe.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.233
- Oh my gosh, I didn't do
anything to the pie,

17:58.333 --> 18:00.233
now will you get back
in there and eat some?!

18:00.333 --> 18:01.067
- But first you swear on your
life you didn't put something

18:01.100 --> 18:03.167
bad in it?

18:03.267 --> 18:04.300
- I swear on your life.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.433
- Your life!

18:05.533 --> 18:08.067
- What difference
does it make?!?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.133
- You pull it.

18:09.233 --> 18:11.767
- I know how to operate
the door.

18:11.867 --> 18:13.900
- Geez Louise!

18:14.067 --> 18:16.867
- AHHHH! OWWW!

18:16.967 --> 18:20.400
This feels so freaky! AHHHH!
OOOOO! Feels so freaky!

18:20.500 --> 18:24.433
- Just relax, just let
the machine do its job.

18:24.533 --> 18:31.067
- Oh, feels nice. Feels nice...
OW! It hurts! It hurts!

18:37.367 --> 18:41.300
- I like to sniff them, too.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.400
- Right on.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.533
- Ahhh! Ahhhh!

18:46.633 --> 18:49.067
Why is this happening?!
Why is this happening?!

18:49.133 --> 18:52.800
- Come on...you girls want us
to believe you're innocent?

18:52.900 --> 18:56.433
Eat some pie.

18:56.533 --> 18:58.067
- Okay, that's it.
You, on your feet.

18:58.133 --> 19:00.433
- Why, what's happening?

19:00.533 --> 19:01.400
- We're taking you down
to the station.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.767
- What? No! Not the pokie!

19:03.867 --> 19:05.333
- Wait, why are you
arresting her?!?

19:05.433 --> 19:06.367
- 'Cuz it was her pie recipe.

19:06.467 --> 19:08.500
- And neither one
of you will eat it.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.900
- Babe help me, I'm scared!

19:11.067 --> 19:13.200
- Stop resisting!

19:13.300 --> 19:18.133
- All right, leave her alone!

19:18.233 --> 19:21.367
I'll eat some pie.

19:36.633 --> 19:42.067
Hey, okay, that is really good.

19:42.167 --> 19:45.067
I thought you said you were
disgusted by peaches.

19:45.133 --> 19:47.967
- I thought I was!

19:48.067 --> 19:51.233
Mmmm, this is fantastic.

19:51.333 --> 19:56.067
Why did I think I didn't
like peaches?!?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.167
Almost done.

20:03.267 --> 20:06.100
This is crazy!
This is crazy!

20:06.200 --> 20:10.633
- And... Cut power!

20:10.733 --> 20:14.267
- Ohhhh! That was intense!

20:14.367 --> 20:17.333
My mouth, all that screaming
got my mouth dry!

20:17.433 --> 20:21.100
- I'll go get you some
cucumber water.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.333
- Ahhh yes.

20:23.433 --> 20:28.000
Now your ear canal is
pristine and beautiful.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.967
- Yep. Just like the rest of me.

20:31.067 --> 20:31.600
- Here ya go, Dad.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.600
- Thank you, son.

20:33.700 --> 20:38.433
- Go get some ear canal
ointment and two cotton balls.

20:38.533 --> 20:41.067
- What? What's wrong?
What's the matter?

20:46.867 --> 20:49.300
- There's a turtle in
my cucumber water!

20:49.400 --> 20:53.667
There's a turtle in
my cucumber water!

20:53.767 --> 20:55.300
- Jerrold!

20:55.400 --> 20:58.633
What is our turtle doing
in the cucumber water?

20:58.733 --> 21:02.333
- He asked me to put
him in there.

21:02.433 --> 21:04.500
- Jerrold!

21:04.600 --> 21:06.700
- Hold on, hold on,
wait a second.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.767
Doctor Loeb!
Do you drink the cucumber water?

21:09.867 --> 21:11.600
- Yes, of course.
Every day, why?

21:11.700 --> 21:14.467
-'Cuz I bet it wasn't
the pie that got you sick.

21:14.567 --> 21:16.733
Maybe it was the turtle water.

21:16.833 --> 21:19.700
- Uh, that could be true,
because turtle urine contains

21:19.800 --> 21:22.100
multiple enzymes that are
extremely toxic to humans.

21:22.200 --> 21:27.367
It's the main reason why people
should never drink turtle urine.

21:27.467 --> 21:30.933
- Oh no, dad, now you're
gonna get sick!

21:31.067 --> 21:32.333
- Oh no I'm not!

21:32.433 --> 21:34.933
Step out the way.
Hand me that tube!

21:35.067 --> 21:36.667
- What are you doing?

21:36.767 --> 21:39.267
- Man, I'm gonna take this tube,
stick it down my stomach,

21:39.367 --> 21:41.433
you people are gonna
turn on that machine

21:41.533 --> 21:43.100
and I'm gonna suck out
all the turtle juice!

21:43.200 --> 21:46.900
AHHHHH!

21:47.067 --> 21:47.567
- Well turn it on!!! -

21:47.667 --> 21:50.800
- Do it! Do it!

22:26.700 --> 22:28.767
* Just drop that

22:28.867 --> 22:30.133
[ oven bell ]

22:30.233 --> 22:31.967
- Mmm...
