00:08.508 --> 00:11.428
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:11.511 --> 00:13.138
The Khi'eth.
There's a life sign.

00:13.221 --> 00:16.433
Someone is alive
inside that ship.

00:16.516 --> 00:19.060
We'll still need to be back
in sickbay in four hours.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.228
At the most.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.022
(male vocalizing)

00:23.106 --> 00:24.149
Excuse me.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.775
Hello?

00:27.902 --> 00:29.028
What if the survivor
doesn't know

00:29.112 --> 00:30.447
the outside world even exists?

00:30.530 --> 00:31.781
What if he's never heard
of the Burn?

00:31.865 --> 00:34.743
(gasps)
You're a part of the program.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.581
Wait, wait!

00:39.664 --> 00:41.291
SU'KAL:
The monster from the story,

00:41.374 --> 00:44.127
it rises from the sea to remind
the children of Kaminar

00:44.210 --> 00:45.795
that to be truly free,

00:45.879 --> 00:48.339
they must face
their deepest fear.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.884
So long as he will not face it,

00:50.967 --> 00:53.094
he will remain in this place.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.346
As will you.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.309
(snarls, growls)

00:59.392 --> 01:01.186
No, no, no!

01:01.269 --> 01:03.980
BOOK:
Michael, I'm in the nebula.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.315
-I have to
pull you all out now.
-Book?

01:05.398 --> 01:06.316
Whatever just happened
down there,

01:06.399 --> 01:07.650
it nearly caused another Burn.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.195
Su'Kal.
He caused the Burn.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.363
BOOK:
I'm here. Where are you?

01:13.364 --> 01:15.658
I'll come back for both of you.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.995
If more than a day goes by,
there's no point.

01:19.078 --> 01:20.497
-Adira?
-They'll need this medication

01:20.580 --> 01:22.457
to survive until
Discovery comes back.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.544
Book.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.171
-Where are the others?
-We have to go back for them.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.006
TILLY:
What do you want?

01:30.089 --> 01:32.300
Your ship, your spore drive

01:32.383 --> 01:35.136
and your crew, as leverage.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.722
VANCE:
Osyraa. She's not

01:37.806 --> 01:40.183
on the Viridian,
she's on Discovery.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.393
And we just
let her in the front door.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.480
I want the Emerald Chain
to unite with the Federation.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.023
There is a deal to be made here.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.025
The person
representing the Chain

01:49.108 --> 01:50.568
has to be proven credible.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.820
And the only way that
that can happen

01:51.903 --> 01:53.988
is if he or she functions

01:54.072 --> 01:55.573
completely independently of you

01:55.657 --> 01:58.201
and tries you for your crimes.
I can promise you justice.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.953
Oh, I can promise you the same.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.206
It's an emergency escape field.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.041
I'm turning on
the homing beacon.

02:05.124 --> 02:06.209
Fed HQ will see you
and bring you in

02:06.292 --> 02:07.544
before Osyraa
knows you're missing.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.711
STAMETS:
Michael, look at me.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.713
-How can you do this?!
-I'm sorry.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.049
Michael!

02:16.135 --> 02:18.304
You're gonna be really sorry
you did that.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.681
(quiet gasps)

02:21.307 --> 02:23.017
You're the sphere data,
aren't you?

02:23.101 --> 02:24.602
Indeed we are.
Hello.

02:24.686 --> 02:25.854
Greetings.

02:25.937 --> 02:29.232
It hid itself in the DOT-23s.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.608
You here to help us?

02:30.692 --> 02:32.569
I am at your service, Captain.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.320
Shall we take back the ship?

02:35.905 --> 02:37.532
VANCE:
Put the fleet at Kaminar
on red alert.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.617
Prepare to fire on Discovery
on my command.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.420
(creature wailing)

02:52.380 --> 02:55.800
WOMAN:
The gormagander,
a sentient cosmozoan species,

02:55.884 --> 02:59.095
holds the ignominious record
of longest time spent

02:59.178 --> 03:02.056
on the Federation's
endangered species list.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.100
That's why this recorded scan

03:04.183 --> 03:08.187
of a young gormagander pup
in 3052

03:08.271 --> 03:11.399
(distorts, slows): was of
particular interest to us...

03:11.482 --> 03:13.484
(recording fades, stops)

03:30.585 --> 03:33.046
That looks painful.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.426
Su'Kal...

03:38.509 --> 03:40.053
I am ill.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.805
This...

03:42.889 --> 03:44.265
-this world...
-Here.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.101
For your wounds.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.149
Saru.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.657
I've looked everywhere,
and things are definitely worse.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.117
More radiation is getting in.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.870
His outburst must have caused
a breach in the ship's hull.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.664
Has he told you
how to turn off the holo?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.707
I believe he knows more
about this world

04:09.791 --> 04:10.708
than he has indicated.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.460
But I cannot force

04:12.543 --> 04:15.171
a shift in perspective
or he could panic.

04:15.254 --> 04:16.881
(sighs)

04:16.965 --> 04:19.342
Another Burn could destroy
what remains of the Federation.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.011
I don't know what else to do.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.346
Talk to him about you.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.306
Tell him you're Kelpien.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.642
Show him there are perspectives
other than his own.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.769
If anyone can get through
to him, it's you.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.020
ADIRA:
Hello?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.022
Anyone? Hugh?

04:33.106 --> 04:36.484
-Adira?
-Oh, my God. (laughs)

04:38.653 --> 04:40.154
What are you doing here?

04:40.238 --> 04:42.532
-Well, um, I brought medicine.
-How?

04:42.615 --> 04:43.908
I hid it in my mouth.

04:45.076 --> 04:48.037
We heard you on board, so
I knew I'd be landing in a holo.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.373
What happened to Discovery?
Has Osyraa gone?

04:50.456 --> 04:52.375
Are they here?
Is Paul okay?

04:52.458 --> 04:55.837
I-I don't know. I didn't exactly
ask permission to come.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.171
CULBER:
I can't believe you did this.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.048
ADIRA:
Yeah, well,
I had to do something.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.758
(chuckles)
Here.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.553
Will these heal you?

05:03.636 --> 05:05.388
No, but they will
buy us some time.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.557
-You found them.
-Yeah.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.892
Not a moment too soon,
looks like.

05:13.312 --> 05:15.773
Gray?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.028
You...

05:20.111 --> 05:21.529
you-you see me?

05:21.612 --> 05:24.407
The holo-- it recognizes you.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.534
Hi.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.088
I-I'd forgotten what...

05:39.172 --> 05:42.091
H-Hi.
(laughs)

05:42.175 --> 05:43.593
You do have kind eyes.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.219
ADIRA:
Told you.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.721
(soft laughter)

05:48.306 --> 05:50.016
(low rumble)

05:53.352 --> 05:54.604
Take Adira and Gray.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.315
Continue to search
for a way to exit the holo.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.067
The medicine
has bought us some time,

05:59.150 --> 06:01.778
but we have only
a few hours left, at most.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.572
And we must make contact with
Discovery, wherever they are.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.707
(snarling)

06:26.385 --> 06:28.429
VANCE:
Voyager, you're gonna

06:28.513 --> 06:30.014
take the lead on the Viridian.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.599
Fire when ready.

06:31.682 --> 06:35.311
On my mark, all other vessels,
fire on Discovery.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.355
What about the message it sends?

06:37.438 --> 06:38.981
That spore drive
is how we reconnect

06:39.065 --> 06:40.983
with all the worlds we've lost.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.820
If Osyraa
reaches them first...

06:43.903 --> 06:45.947
the Federation is done for.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.575
-Open fire.
-Firing, sir.

06:54.372 --> 06:57.208
OSYRAA:
Tell the Viridian
to increase firepower.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.668
Get us out of here.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.628
Copy that.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.671
(grunts)

07:01.754 --> 07:03.673
Reroute auxiliary power
to shields.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.842
Fire at target location bearing
three-six degrees alpha.

07:05.925 --> 07:06.968
REGULATOR:
But that's their...

07:07.051 --> 07:08.469
Their primary shield emitter

07:08.553 --> 07:11.013
disguised as a secondary
deflector array.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.723
REGULATOR:
Yes, Osyraa.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.892
She knows about
our shield emitter.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.146
-How long can it hold?
-Five minutes, at most.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.939
Tell the fleet
to hit them harder.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.489
Give them everything we got.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.200
-Aurellio,
is the truth serum ready?
-AURELLIO: Yes, Osyraa.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.203
OSYRAA:
You are taking us to that
dilithium planet, Cleveland.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.997
Find your own path
through that nebula.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.832
I'm not telling you
a damn thing.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.333
That's what everyone says
and then they sing

07:39.417 --> 07:42.003
like an Alcorian sorrowhawk.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.546
OSYRAA:
Ready a course

07:43.629 --> 07:46.632
for Base 755, have
reinforcements meet us there.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.719
Inform them that
our alliance was refused.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.138
I want the Federation
obliterated.

07:56.475 --> 08:00.813
I take it you saw
Stamets' escape pod. Mm.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.234
My team will find a way
to make the spore drive work.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.737
And thanks
to your special friend,

08:07.820 --> 08:09.655
we will have
plenty of dilithium.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.116
REGULATOR:
Sir, I'm getting reports
of a firefight on deck seven.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.410
Hostiles are advancing,
heading to the bridge.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.579
What can I say?
We are Starfleet.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.581
Get him to sickbay.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.250
Tell Aurellio to be quick
about it and send a message:

08:21.334 --> 08:24.170
all regulators to decks five
and above immediately.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.255
Aah!

08:27.340 --> 08:29.926
Turbolift around
the corner in 15 meters.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.553
Clear!

08:39.852 --> 08:41.896
RHYS:
Flank left. I got right.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.486
DETMER:
They're retreating.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.613
-Where are they going?
-(whooshing)

08:51.697 --> 08:53.783
-What is that?
-What the hell?

08:53.866 --> 08:56.953
-Is that wind?
-EMERALD CHAIN COMPUTER:
Life support shutoff imminent.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.622
Turbolift!
Go, go, go, go, go!

08:59.705 --> 09:01.624
EMERALD CHAIN COMPUTER:
Life support disengaged.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.085
Decks six through 18 sealed.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.297
Life support was shut off
on Discovery's lower decks.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.675
Vents are open,
air's leaking out, slowly.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.635
-Is there anyone down there?
-Can't tell, sir.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.178
Life signs are still scrambled.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.805
KOVICH:
It's got to be the crew.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.307
Seems Osyraa plans
to take her time killing them.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.351
We lose shields
in 60 seconds, Admiral.

09:20.434 --> 09:23.145
STAMETS:
Stop shooting!
Please, sir, cease fire.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.650
Captain Saru
is trapped in the nebula.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.860
We need to force our way
back onto Discovery.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.153
They can't jump without me.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.947
We can't risk sending you back.

09:33.030 --> 09:36.158
It's not just Captain Saru, sir.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.661
-WILLA:
We lose shields in 30 seconds.
-I know,

09:38.744 --> 09:40.997
but Commander Burnham
did the right thing.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.832
-Get him to the Foresight.
-Admiral...

09:42.915 --> 09:44.667
No, you're the only one that
can operate the spore drive.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.627
You're going with
the civilian emergency transport

09:46.711 --> 09:47.920
as far away from here
as possible.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.299
-Listen!
-Believe me, I know
what you're sacrificing here.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.301
-I'm sorry.
-No... Let go of me!

09:55.219 --> 09:56.304
Our shields are going down, sir.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.847
Prepare to pursue.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.141
FEDERATION HQ COMPUTER:
Warning: outer shield breach.

10:00.224 --> 10:03.352
Nearest Chain base is 755.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.313
We're being hailed.

10:05.396 --> 10:08.482
Audio only.
It's Ni'Var, sir.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.694
Coming in at maximum warp.
They sent a fleet.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.487
They say they're here to help.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.705
REGULATOR:
Ni'Var Razors are blocking
our way out of the shield, sir.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.040
OSYRAA:
Tell the Viridian

10:24.123 --> 10:26.167
to deploy its cache
of pesticides.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.377
Target shuttle bays,
intakes

10:28.461 --> 10:30.087
-and airlocks.
-Stop.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.506
Don't.
I'll take to Admiral Vance.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.382
I'll get him to stand down.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.718
I'm a little busy
for games right now.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.553
Ni'Var is here because of me.

10:37.636 --> 10:40.389
They trust me.
Vance trusts me.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.932
All the more reason
why I cannot.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.267
You're outnumbered
and outgunned.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.227
You have nothing to lose.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.275
Hail him.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.905
-Admiral.
-VANCE: Minister Osyraa.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.907
Whatever you're
about to ask me...

10:57.990 --> 10:59.658
We hailed you
at my request, sir.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.202
You need to let us go.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.746
Says the hostage
with a phaser to her head.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.415
Didn't you send
the distress call to Ni'Var?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.376
I did, but we don't
need to escalate this.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.710
If you let us go...

11:09.794 --> 11:12.296
-Discovery is far too
valuable. -Not without
Commander Stamets.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.382
Sir, I know we haven't
always seen eye to eye,

11:14.465 --> 11:16.050
but you can trust me.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.886
You can trust us.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.139
We won't let you down.

11:23.682 --> 11:26.435
I won't let you down.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.187
Let us go.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.284
Well, that went well.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.953
Ready torpedoes.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.621
Fire at the pesticide cache

11:45.704 --> 11:47.456
as soon as the Viridian
releases it.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.333
The contaminated shrapnel
will make short work

11:49.417 --> 11:51.043
of any ships within range.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.878
Sir, Federation ships
are backing off.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.676
Now turn life support
back on.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.302
I'll get my crew
to stand down, too.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.221
They had their chance.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.432
Maximum warp.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.642
And get her the hell
off my bridge.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.489
♪ ♪

12:40.342 --> 12:42.344

13:01.780 --> 13:03.824

13:35.231 --> 13:37.233

playing)

13:57.836 --> 14:00.214
It has helped your face,
the kelp.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.258
I knew it would work.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.010
Ah.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.805
More wounds will appear.

14:09.306 --> 14:12.101
Perhaps I could explain
over a meal.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.103
We can prepare it together.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.939
Um, are you familiar
with sàì-núù-lem?

14:17.022 --> 14:20.609
Sàì-núù-lem is a traditional
food from Kaminar.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.112
I've always wanted to make it,
but the holos don't

14:23.195 --> 14:24.738
give good instructions.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.116
I would be happy to teach you.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.617
We have enough wood
for a small fire.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.328
But how do you know
how to make it?

14:31.412 --> 14:33.289
I learned from my father.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.291
Those are among the most

14:35.374 --> 14:37.418
precious memories of my
childhood,

14:37.501 --> 14:39.295
that time with him.

14:39.378 --> 14:43.757
And serving it to my mother
and sister.

14:43.841 --> 14:48.929
I've never seen a human holo
eat sàì-núù-lem.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.265
I know it must be confusing.

14:51.348 --> 14:55.227
But things are not always
as they appear.

14:57.062 --> 15:00.232
I am not as-as I appear.

15:00.316 --> 15:04.111
In fact, I'm-I'm much like you.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.114
I am Kelpien.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.007
I'm a courier, Doc,
I know all about microdosing.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.967
The effects
aren't always immediate.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.303
He's built immunity.
Give me the neural lock.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.221
-I'm not putting
the neural lock...
-Give-give me

15:31.305 --> 15:32.681
-the neural lock!
-I will not put
the neural lock...

15:32.765 --> 15:34.683
So you went all the way
to Hunhau

15:34.767 --> 15:37.728
to save him from my nephew,
and then to Kwejian

15:37.811 --> 15:39.021
to help his family.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.482
I want that dilithium.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.693
Be persuasive.
Or you're next.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.612
Get the flight path
from our logs.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.198
Or did my crew erase it
before you could

15:49.281 --> 15:50.199
pull them from the bridge?

15:50.282 --> 15:52.493
(chuckles)

15:52.576 --> 15:55.245
I think I might
actually like you.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.247
Give Zareh the neural lock.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.708
Osyraa, please,
my serum will work.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.169
ZAREH:
Sure, he's docile now, but...

16:02.252 --> 16:04.380
Violence is not necessary.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.547
Why don't we test that theory?

16:05.631 --> 16:10.094
Mr. Booker's empathic nature
would make it excruciating.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.054
Now is not the time
for soft hearts.

16:12.137 --> 16:15.391
You saved me.
You have saved others.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.392
I know your heart.

16:16.475 --> 16:21.105
Orion hearts have six valves.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.732
Blood flows in both directions.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.111
They are so much more complex
than human hearts.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.530
I won't let it happen, Osyraa.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.412
I am genuinely fond of you.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.414
-(choking)
-But make no mistake,

16:38.497 --> 16:40.082
I saved you because
you're useful to me.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.418
And even when that ceases
to be the case,

16:42.501 --> 16:45.212
the bond we have means that
you and your family can

16:45.295 --> 16:47.423
live comfortably in a location
of your choosing.

16:47.506 --> 16:51.719
Break that bond again
and you won't wake up next time.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.063
Book...
(grunts)

17:05.190 --> 17:07.860
OSYRAA:
He will die from sheer agony.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.237
Have you ever seen that before?

17:10.320 --> 17:11.947
Make the smart choice.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.867
Book, listen to me.
I've got you.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.910
No, you don't.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.288
This is what's called
a no-win situation.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.581
I don't believe in those.

17:20.664 --> 17:23.083
Well, then, you still
have a lot to learn.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.423
(groaning)

17:31.091 --> 17:32.926
(screaming)

17:35.262 --> 17:37.431
SU'KAL:
How can you be Kelpien?

17:37.514 --> 17:40.142
You don't look like me.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.853
The holo changes things
sometimes.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.980
Makes them appear different,

17:45.063 --> 17:46.982
or-or places them
where they do not belong.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.817
Surely you've noticed.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.653
Long ago, that door

17:51.737 --> 17:54.490
led only to Kaminar.

17:54.573 --> 17:58.494
Now it sometimes
leads to other worlds.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.788
What else do you know
of the Federation worlds?

18:00.871 --> 18:04.833
Were you ever taught
that they were... outside?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.502
You want to talk about
outside again.

18:06.585 --> 18:07.836
I do not like that.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.422
May I ask why?

18:13.425 --> 18:16.678
The holos said the Federation
would come for me,

18:16.762 --> 18:19.014
from outside.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.227
If outside exists,

18:23.310 --> 18:26.438
why didn't they come?

18:28.273 --> 18:30.234
The Federation wanted to come.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.528
Wanting is not the same
as doing.

18:32.611 --> 18:36.490
Something... happened,

18:36.573 --> 18:39.660
which prevented long-distance
travel for many years.

18:39.743 --> 18:40.869
What happened?

18:40.953 --> 18:43.705
-It was long ago.
-What happened?

18:43.789 --> 18:44.706
It is complicated.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.208
Tell me!

18:50.337 --> 18:52.881
Please, please, Su'Kal,

18:52.965 --> 18:55.259
be calm.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.719
This is my life.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.097
I need to understand.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.731
Warp drives malfunctioned.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.109
It was called the Burn.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.153
It affected everyone,
not just the Federation.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.531
But the important thing is...

19:17.614 --> 19:20.325
we are here now.

19:21.827 --> 19:25.414
And we are because
your mother reached out.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.291
My mother?

19:27.374 --> 19:29.585
She created this world

19:29.668 --> 19:32.045
to keep you safe.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.881
But... she never intended

19:33.964 --> 19:35.591
you should live here forever.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.103
Wait.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.661
(grunts)

20:05.996 --> 20:06.914
Stop!

20:06.997 --> 20:08.916
Tell him to give me what I need.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.084
(screams)

20:11.168 --> 20:12.461
This man has stamina,

20:12.544 --> 20:14.087
but won't last much longer.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.089
Just FYI.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.217
Well, let him catch his breath.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.138
Book...

20:23.221 --> 20:25.265
All of this...

20:25.349 --> 20:26.808
unpleasantry...

20:26.892 --> 20:28.435
can end, you know.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.857
Your friends will be unconscious

20:33.941 --> 20:35.651
in less than 30 minutes

20:35.734 --> 20:37.319
and dead within the hour.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.905
The Federation
is a-is a shell of itself,

20:39.988 --> 20:42.908
just going through the motions.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.619
You can't save any of them.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.996
But...

20:48.080 --> 20:49.790
you can save him.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.835
Do you really want to wake up
tomorrow morning

20:53.919 --> 20:56.713
having lost everything?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.884
Maximum intensity.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.179
(screaming)

21:04.262 --> 21:07.516
Okay, stop, stop!
I'll talk to him! Just stop.

21:07.599 --> 21:08.809
Stop.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.647
Get your hands off me.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.525
Stick close to her.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.362
Book, I'm here.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.363
(weakly):
Michael...

21:21.446 --> 21:23.198
don't ask me.

21:23.281 --> 21:26.410
I'm sorry for the pain
you've had to endure.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.788
And I'm sorry that
it's about to get worse.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.499
(grunting)

21:32.582 --> 21:34.376
EMERALD CHAIN COMPUTER:
Medical emergency.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.670
-Quarantine activated.
-Turn it off!

21:36.753 --> 21:38.505
Get this damn force field down.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.008
-ZAREH: I'm working on it.
-OSYRAA: Come on! Come on!

21:41.091 --> 21:42.718
You good?

21:42.801 --> 21:44.761
Come on.
Let's go.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.141
(growls)

21:53.478 --> 21:55.272
TILLY:
Hey, any luck with
the emergency backup?

21:55.355 --> 21:56.690
Let you know in one minute.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.233
Give the oxygen to Keyla.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.736
TILLY:
No, hey, you can't help
if you're not conscious.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.113
I was holding my breath
for at least ten minutes

22:03.196 --> 22:04.406
by the time
I was eight years old.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.241
I didn't know that.

22:06.324 --> 22:08.243
At home we'd freedive
for abalone

22:08.326 --> 22:10.120
in the Ogbunike caves.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.497
It was as much for tradition
as for sustenance.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.082
Or that's how it was, anyway.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.584
BRYCE:
Bad news.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.795
There's no way to bypass
Emerald Chain command functions.

22:18.879 --> 22:19.921
What about a hard reboot?

22:20.005 --> 22:23.592
We'd have to be able to access
the data core in person.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.595
So we're gonna have to fight
until our last breath.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.639
ZAREH:
All personnel,
code red, deck five.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.142
It's Michael.

22:32.225 --> 22:35.103
Can't you just
beam us somewhere?

22:35.187 --> 22:37.522
Transport jammer.
We're all on foot.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.402
Damn adrenaline.
When's my heart

22:42.486 --> 22:44.404
-meant to slow down?
-With what we're about to do,

22:44.488 --> 22:46.406
-not anytime soon.
-Sounds ominous.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.867
Let's just say it'll make
Sigma Ten feel like a vacation.

22:48.950 --> 22:50.535
Definitely ominous, then.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.581
You stole a regulator badge?

22:54.664 --> 22:55.791
Sure did.

22:55.874 --> 22:56.875
(chuckles)

22:58.001 --> 23:00.796
Regulator ID: Green 512.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.799
-Computer,
open a ship-wide channel.
-Channel open.

23:03.882 --> 23:07.260
It wasn't a particularly
happy birthday.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.304
But I found you.

23:09.387 --> 23:12.099
We played seven-card stud
and drank synthehol.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.518
Too bad we didn't
have fireworks.

23:14.601 --> 23:17.020
Nothing stops a party
like fireworks.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.563
Who's she talking to?

23:19.564 --> 23:21.942
Me.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.195
I assume someone will be able
to make sense of that?

23:25.278 --> 23:26.488
Yeah.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.281
Now we just got to get
to the data core.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.866
Then let's take back this ship.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.874
(badge shatters)

23:37.958 --> 23:40.919
-Clear here.
-clear here.

23:44.172 --> 23:47.634
TILLY:
Last year, I was, um,
I was going through a hard time.

23:47.717 --> 23:50.178
I got off my shift
and I just hid in a nacelle,

23:50.262 --> 23:52.013
just waiting
for the day to pass.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.557
But she found me.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.143
She brought cards and synthehol,

23:56.226 --> 23:58.562
and we played poker and drank

23:58.645 --> 24:01.022
until 0000 hours.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.442
She didn't wish me
happy birthday once.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.658
She wants us to go to a nacelle.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.326
The magnetic fields are affected

24:13.410 --> 24:15.579
by extreme heat, so...

24:15.662 --> 24:18.248
if we could set off a...
a thermochemical bomb

24:18.331 --> 24:21.543
in between superconductors
holding Discovery

24:21.626 --> 24:23.545
to its nacelles.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.214
So that we'll temporarily
break the magnetic seal.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.592
Yeah, that'll
knock us out of warp.

24:28.675 --> 24:32.220
And our allies will be able
to catch up to us.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.347
But the magnetic field
could destroy the DOTs

24:34.431 --> 24:36.558
before they could even
set the bomb.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.519
That's why we have to
do it ourselves.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.271
It's a suicide mission.

24:41.354 --> 24:45.233
We can die here or we can die

24:45.317 --> 24:48.153
stopping Osyraa
and saving the Federation.

24:49.654 --> 24:50.906
But that is up to you.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.032
Each of you.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.703
I'll go get the chemicals.

24:56.786 --> 24:58.914
I'll start on the fuse.

25:14.679 --> 25:15.931
Su'Kal.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.519
Kaminar is empty.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.772
The holos are all gone.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.774
Where did they go?

25:25.857 --> 25:30.237
Kaminar was never
through that door.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.948
It is an entire world.

25:33.031 --> 25:36.159
There... there are many worlds

25:36.243 --> 25:39.579
and many individuals.
Not only holos.

25:39.663 --> 25:43.166
I am sentient.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.252
Just as you are.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.130
You must sense it.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.467
That we are different
from the holos.

25:52.550 --> 25:55.178
I've always felt different.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.307
Yes.

25:59.391 --> 26:03.103
Uh, like you, I have been
at a crossroads.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.730
I've had to choose between

26:05.814 --> 26:08.024
leaving the only world
I had ever known...

26:08.108 --> 26:10.777
or staying.

26:10.860 --> 26:14.489
And I, too, was afraid.

26:14.572 --> 26:17.158
But you said my mother
built this world

26:17.242 --> 26:19.577
to keep me safe.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.708
Outside can be challenging.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.459
Dangerous?

26:26.543 --> 26:30.380
But it is also
beautiful and diverse

26:30.463 --> 26:33.425
and filled with wonder.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.719
All that you have learned here

26:35.802 --> 26:38.305
was meant to help you
understand it.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.977
MONSTER:
See me.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.395
SU'KAL:
It's back--

26:45.478 --> 26:47.856
the creature that chases me.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.358
-Su'Kal, it came
from the folktale.
-No. No.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.068
-It is trying to help you.
-No.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.321
Whatever's behind
that locked door,

26:54.404 --> 26:56.197
whatever happened
to make you afraid,

26:56.281 --> 27:00.035
-you must face it or we will
-No.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.120
-all die here.
See me.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.705
No, I won't!

27:03.788 --> 27:05.415
I need to find the elder.

27:07.625 --> 27:11.004
CULBER:
Hello? We are
the anticipated input.

27:11.087 --> 27:12.630
We've come for the child.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.717
You said the Vulcan holo

27:15.800 --> 27:17.052
was showing
its underlying programming.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.054
Maybe it's already fritzed out.

27:19.137 --> 27:22.307
Or got lost in that.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.352
CULBER:
Those are the edges of the holo.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.103
The ship would be
just beyond that.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.396
We should check it out,

27:28.480 --> 27:29.856
see how badly
the hull's compromised.

27:29.939 --> 27:32.067
I tried.
I got sick right away.

27:32.150 --> 27:35.028
The radiation in there
is definitely worse.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.237
I could go.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.864
-Gray...
-I...

27:37.947 --> 27:39.699
I'm not actually
corporeal, remember?

27:39.783 --> 27:41.284
Radiation can't hurt me.

27:54.589 --> 27:57.634
ADIRA:
How could Su'Kal
have caused the Burn?

27:57.717 --> 27:59.594
I...
How is that even possible?

27:59.677 --> 28:00.887
I can't prove it without a scan,

28:00.970 --> 28:02.931
but I suspect he's a polyploid.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.766
That's when normal
chromosomal separation

28:04.849 --> 28:06.434
is disrupted in utero.
It can

28:06.518 --> 28:08.103
cause an individual's genes
to be affected

28:08.186 --> 28:09.312
by their environment,

28:09.396 --> 28:12.440
and this environment has massive

28:12.524 --> 28:14.984
concentrations of dilithium.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.445
Not to mention
whatever's outside.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.802
ADIRA:
You think Su'Kal's

28:40.885 --> 28:43.096
genetically connected
to dilithium?

28:43.179 --> 28:45.140
I think his genes have mutated
to allow his body

28:45.223 --> 28:47.809
to interact with dilithium
in unique ways, yes.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.103
Well, dilithium
has a subspace component.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.647
Uh, does that-does that mean
he'd have a genetic connection

28:52.730 --> 28:54.315
to subspace, too?

28:54.399 --> 28:56.192
That would explain a lot.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.821
Did anything unusual
happen on board

28:59.904 --> 29:02.115
-before you beamed down here?
-Yeah, our-our warp core

29:02.198 --> 29:03.533
reacted to something,

29:03.616 --> 29:06.202
uh, a subspace radiation surge.
Why?

29:06.286 --> 29:07.787
Su'Kal got upset.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.623
He screamed
and the entire ground shook.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.792
Sound is-is a mechanical wave.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.795
Its energy travels
through a medium.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.964
-Like subspace.
-His scream must have

29:18.047 --> 29:19.674
traveled at
the resonant frequency

29:19.757 --> 29:22.010
of-of dilithium's
subspace components.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.219
That's what hit our warp core.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.805
So whatever frightened him
125 years ago

29:25.889 --> 29:29.267
must have been infinitely worse
than what happened to him today.

29:31.227 --> 29:34.564
That's what caused the Burn.

29:42.405 --> 29:45.116
ADIRA:
Can we stop the Burn
from happening again?

29:45.200 --> 29:48.077
If we can get him away from all
of this dilithium, I think so.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.873
The ship's falling apart.

29:51.956 --> 29:53.541
Shields won't hold
for much longer.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.711
If Su'Kal has answers,

29:56.794 --> 29:59.214
we need them.
Like, now.

29:59.297 --> 30:02.008
Ah, Su'Kal.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.552
The elder's gone.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.224
I am so sorry.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.267
His absence can only reflect

30:11.351 --> 30:14.354
how severely
this world is degrading.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.900
We must go, Su'Kal.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.027
I saw outside once.

30:22.946 --> 30:26.032
When I was so very small.
It was...

30:26.115 --> 30:27.867
Terrifying.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.414
The elder read stories to me.

30:33.498 --> 30:36.918
They calmed me.
They made me feel safe.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.254
I do not have him now.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.631
You have us.

30:43.841 --> 30:46.970
You have me.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.560
Please, Su'Kal,

30:53.643 --> 30:55.061
take us to that room.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.604
Whatever is inside,

30:56.688 --> 30:59.774
it is time to see.

30:59.857 --> 31:02.277
RHYS:
Why can't the nacelles
be closer?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.153
We're almost
to the access point.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.614

31:10.243 --> 31:12.662
I don't think I can get up.

31:12.745 --> 31:14.330
You have to try.

31:14.414 --> 31:15.790
Both of you.

31:15.873 --> 31:18.209
Owo, you have to go by yourself.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.169
Take the oxygen.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.421
What?

31:21.504 --> 31:22.964
No.
You'll suffocate.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.092
We're just delaying
the inevitable.

31:26.175 --> 31:28.845
You have to finish the mission.

31:33.808 --> 31:36.436
Please.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.129
I love you all.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.308
-How much longer do you need?
-Two minutes.

32:15.391 --> 32:16.559
How about 15 seconds?

32:17.977 --> 32:19.354
Anytime.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.564

40:19.708 --> 40:22.128
Report to the bridge
immediately.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.677
(grunting)

40:31.095 --> 40:33.806
(whirring slowly)

40:34.807 --> 40:37.518
You pulled me out of there.

40:37.601 --> 40:41.272
(distorted):
It was my honor.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.234
(softly):
Thank you.

40:45.317 --> 40:48.362
(coughing nearby)

40:48.445 --> 40:51.198
You're alive.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.825
So are you.

40:55.411 --> 40:56.745
All of you.

40:58.747 --> 40:59.665
You did it?

40:59.748 --> 41:02.251
We did it.

41:05.504 --> 41:07.298
Let's go to the bridge, then.

41:12.469 --> 41:14.889
BURNHAM:
You made it.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.057
All right.
(laughs)

41:17.141 --> 41:19.602
We're using the same operating
system from before the upgrade.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.145
Can't say I mind.

41:21.228 --> 41:23.063
-(crashing)
-(alarm blaring)

41:23.147 --> 41:24.523
What the hell is that?

41:24.607 --> 41:26.901
It's anti-proton cannons.

41:26.984 --> 41:28.235
Osyraa is dead,

41:28.319 --> 41:30.613
and I got her regulators
off our ship,

41:30.696 --> 41:32.114
but we're stuck
inside the Viridian

41:32.198 --> 41:33.574
and they're trying
to breach the hull.

41:33.657 --> 41:37.411
Um, Captain, we have an idea.

41:37.494 --> 41:39.205
Then implement it.

41:39.288 --> 41:40.414
Tilly?

41:40.498 --> 41:43.334
We need you to lead us. You.

41:45.169 --> 41:48.505
But, um, if it helps,
that's an order.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.138
Our priority is to get out
of here and back to the nebula

41:56.222 --> 41:57.556
as quickly as possible.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.725
You think they could
still be alive?

41:59.808 --> 42:02.144
I don't know,
but we have to find out.

42:02.228 --> 42:03.437
The Viridian
won't just let us go.

42:03.520 --> 42:04.813
I don't expect them to.

42:04.897 --> 42:06.440
Which is why we have
to eject the warp core

42:06.523 --> 42:08.567
and blow our way out.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.028
-(explosion)
-What?

42:12.029 --> 42:13.948
We'll blow ourselves
along with it.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.908
There's a chance we won't.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.494
I was really hoping
you would say that.

42:18.577 --> 42:20.829
Aurellio?

42:20.913 --> 42:23.624
I've studied many types
of empaths.

42:23.707 --> 42:26.001
The Kwejian version
is different.

42:26.085 --> 42:29.421
Mr. Booker doesn't just feel,
he connects.

42:29.505 --> 42:31.131
He's able to communicate
with species

42:31.215 --> 42:32.967
that are nothing like his own.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.469
Commander Stamets
needs Tardigrade DNA

42:35.552 --> 42:37.012
to communicate with the spores.

42:37.096 --> 42:39.640
But you think Book could do it
just because of who he is?

42:39.723 --> 42:42.309
That his DNA
would make it possible?

42:42.393 --> 42:44.144
-I do.
-We give it a go,

42:44.228 --> 42:45.771
or we wait till the regulators
blast through our shields

42:45.854 --> 42:47.356
and kill us anyway.

42:47.439 --> 42:49.692
At least this way,
we still have a shot.

42:51.694 --> 42:54.488
Sensors are fully operational.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.283
Spore drive is activated.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.993
Comms are operational.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.327
Outside channels are open.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.162
Shields holding at 50%.

43:02.246 --> 43:03.831
Weapons systems on line.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.291
All are armed
and ready to deploy.

43:05.374 --> 43:08.127
Warp core is ready, Commander.

43:08.210 --> 43:10.170
You good, Book?

43:10.254 --> 43:12.172
Always.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.466
Lieutenant Bryce, contact
Voyager and the Ni'Var fleet.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.635
Tell them to get
to a safe distance.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.512
-Yes, Commander.
-Lieutenant Ina,

43:18.596 --> 43:19.972
beam Book directly
into the spore cube.

43:20.055 --> 43:21.098
Aye, Commander.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.563
Initiate warp core overload.

43:27.646 --> 43:29.690
Drop it on my mark.

43:48.792 --> 43:52.379
See.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.923
SU'KAL:
I'm afraid to turn off the holo.

43:56.925 --> 43:59.219
SARU:
I know it is hard,

43:59.303 --> 44:02.348
but you must take
a leap of faith.

44:02.431 --> 44:03.932
It is the only way
we will all survive.

44:04.016 --> 44:05.851
The structure, the ship,
that houses this environment

44:05.934 --> 44:07.519
is-is failing.

44:07.603 --> 44:09.730
-You can see it.
-Su'Kal.

44:09.813 --> 44:12.274
You're okay.

44:12.358 --> 44:16.236
I know you don't feel that
right now, but you are.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.697
And it's okay to be afraid.

44:22.034 --> 44:24.161
The Elder used to say that.

44:25.162 --> 44:30.626
Even in fear, Su'Kal,
you can still step forward.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.440
SU'KAL:
I have not been in here
since I was a child.

44:54.900 --> 44:57.778
(moans weakly)

45:02.324 --> 45:05.911
Once he turns off
the holo, I-I'll...

45:05.994 --> 45:07.621
I will still see you.

45:07.704 --> 45:09.957
It's not enough.

45:12.167 --> 45:13.794
I'm stuck.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.921
Tal is stuck.

45:16.004 --> 45:19.299
And now I know
what I've been missing. I-I...

45:19.383 --> 45:21.510
-Hey. Hey.
-To go back, I just, I...

45:21.593 --> 45:23.762
We got you, Gray.

45:23.846 --> 45:26.807
Okay? Adira, Paul and me?

45:26.890 --> 45:30.352
We'll find a way to help you
be seen-- truly seen...

45:31.395 --> 45:33.063
...by everyone.

45:37.067 --> 45:40.279
This part of the journey
is yours.

45:40.362 --> 45:41.905
But I will not leave you.

46:06.221 --> 46:07.556
(console whining)

46:13.562 --> 46:15.314
KELPIEN SHIP COMPUTER:
Program terminated.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.859
(whimpering moan)

46:18.942 --> 46:22.362
Simulation deconstructing.

46:22.446 --> 46:24.031
(Su'Kal whimpers)

46:37.753 --> 46:39.755
(sighs)

46:52.142 --> 46:54.937
Oh, Computer...

46:55.020 --> 46:57.856
show me what I saw here

46:57.940 --> 47:01.360
so I can be free.

47:01.443 --> 47:03.612
KELPIEN SHIP COMPUTER:
Accessing archives.

47:03.695 --> 47:06.406
Presenting final entry
before disruption.

47:12.871 --> 47:14.998
ISSA:
Su'Kal?

47:18.710 --> 47:22.005
YOUNG SU'KAL:
What happened to our family?

47:24.007 --> 47:26.009
ISSA (weakly):
They did not survive.

47:28.220 --> 47:29.972
Su'Kal.

47:30.055 --> 47:34.768
I told you not to touch
the console.

47:34.851 --> 47:38.105
Not until the Federation comes.

47:38.188 --> 47:40.148
(gasping)

47:54.663 --> 47:57.624
(Young Su'Kal screaming)

47:57.708 --> 47:59.710
(screaming echoes)

48:01.336 --> 48:05.173
(screaming continues)

48:05.257 --> 48:07.301
(whooshing)

48:13.682 --> 48:16.643
(Young Su'Kal's
screaming echoes, fades)

48:19.521 --> 48:21.648
KELPIEN SHIP COMPUTER:
End of recorded archive.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.775
(whimpers softly)

48:34.286 --> 48:38.373
SARU:
She knew you would be
frightened to see her like that.

48:38.457 --> 48:43.086
She wanted you to feel
connected, loved.

48:43.170 --> 48:45.380
I was alone.

48:47.382 --> 48:50.052
You are no longer alone.

49:02.189 --> 49:04.149
(gasps)

49:08.445 --> 49:11.073
You are real.

49:27.631 --> 49:29.800
CULBER:
Culber to Discovery.

49:30.801 --> 49:32.302
Come in, Discovery. Please.

49:35.097 --> 49:36.515
All friendly vessels
at distance.

49:36.598 --> 49:38.392
Warp core overload
in 30 seconds.

49:38.475 --> 49:39.685
Book, how's that adrenaline?

49:40.977 --> 49:42.020
Hasn't let up once.

49:42.104 --> 49:44.106
I never told you
about my mentor,

49:44.189 --> 49:46.358
by the way, Cleveland Booker.

49:46.441 --> 49:48.860
I'll tell you the story
if we survive this.

49:48.944 --> 49:51.196
Point being, I try to live up
to the name...

49:52.197 --> 49:53.573
...every day.

49:53.657 --> 49:55.450
I can't wait to hear
all about it.

49:58.286 --> 50:00.080
Black alert.

50:06.712 --> 50:08.755
Eject the warp core.

50:19.182 --> 50:20.434
Done.

50:22.686 --> 50:24.604
And jump.

50:27.357 --> 50:28.859
(quietly):
Come on.

50:30.610 --> 50:32.237
Book? Jump.

50:35.866 --> 50:37.784
Book, jump.

50:38.702 --> 50:40.328
Please jump.

50:49.421 --> 50:51.465
(muffled explosion)

51:01.057 --> 51:03.351
DR. ISSA HOLOGRAM:
Words are not enough
to thank you

51:03.435 --> 51:05.395
for finding
and rescuing my child.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.939
He is so young,

51:08.023 --> 51:11.610
and this world is all
he has ever known.

51:11.693 --> 51:15.947
Please take him home to Kaminar,
to our family in Narrows Firth.

51:16.031 --> 51:19.326
The water in the estuary
is normally sweet,

51:19.409 --> 51:22.120
but when the tide is high,
it becomes so salty

51:22.204 --> 51:24.164
that one can float.

51:24.247 --> 51:27.000
Tell his grandfather
to float him.

51:27.083 --> 51:29.336
Float him
during Nereid's Shower.

51:29.419 --> 51:31.254
He will understand.

51:32.255 --> 51:34.257
And if...

51:36.259 --> 51:39.387
...when, he cries, tell him

51:39.471 --> 51:41.890
to look up into the night sky

51:41.973 --> 51:46.478
and find the brightest
of all those many suns

51:46.561 --> 51:48.855
and imagine that
it is his mother and father

51:48.939 --> 51:50.398
looking down upon him

51:50.482 --> 51:53.735
with all the love
that their hearts can hold.

52:03.954 --> 52:06.832
It was me.

52:06.915 --> 52:09.334
When I screamed.

52:09.417 --> 52:14.381
When I made the world shake,
I... caused the Burn?

52:14.464 --> 52:16.383
Yes.

52:19.469 --> 52:21.638
What if it happens again?

52:23.640 --> 52:25.016
CULBER:
It won't.

52:25.100 --> 52:28.270
Not once we take you from here.

52:30.605 --> 52:34.150
I would like to help repair
what is broken, i-if I can.

52:35.652 --> 52:40.031
You can,
but this was not your fault.

52:41.992 --> 52:43.535
You could not have known.

52:43.618 --> 52:45.745
Do you understand?

52:45.829 --> 52:47.998
It is hard.

52:48.081 --> 52:49.583
I will help you.

52:53.628 --> 52:55.130
(creaking and thudding)

52:55.213 --> 52:57.549
KELPIEN SHIP COMPUTER:
Structural failure imminent.

52:57.632 --> 52:58.758
-Culber to Discovery.
-Structural failure imminent.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.302
Come in.

53:00.385 --> 53:03.305
(distorted): Warning.
Structural failure imminent.

53:03.388 --> 53:05.432
(creaking and thudding)

53:12.689 --> 53:14.900
Whatever happens,

53:14.983 --> 53:16.818
we are together.

53:22.991 --> 53:24.910
BURNHAM (distorted):
Saru?

53:24.993 --> 53:26.453
Saru?

53:26.536 --> 53:28.121
-(clearly):
It's us, it's Discovery.
-Michael?

53:28.204 --> 53:29.706
-(gasps)
-(sighs of relief)

53:30.790 --> 53:31.958
SARU:
Commander,

53:32.042 --> 53:34.461
it is so very good
to hear your voice.

53:34.544 --> 53:37.255
BURNHAM:
We're locked onto you,
all of you.

53:37.339 --> 53:39.466
Prepare to beam up.

53:39.549 --> 53:42.010
Are we going Outside now?

53:42.093 --> 53:44.387
Yes, Su'Kal. We are.

53:48.516 --> 53:50.518
(explosions)

54:17.295 --> 54:20.298
BURNHAM:
Disconnection.

54:20.382 --> 54:23.551
That's how this future began.

54:23.635 --> 54:27.681
One moment in time
that radiated outward,

54:27.764 --> 54:29.307
until no one even remembered

54:29.391 --> 54:32.018
that connection
was possible anymore.

54:32.978 --> 54:35.522
But it is.

54:35.605 --> 54:37.357
The need to connect

54:37.440 --> 54:40.735
is at our core
as sentient beings.

54:43.822 --> 54:47.283
It takes time, effort

54:47.367 --> 54:49.577
and understanding.

54:49.661 --> 54:51.955
Sometimes...

54:53.206 --> 54:56.042
...it feels impossible.

55:01.631 --> 55:03.341
But if we work at it...

55:05.343 --> 55:07.053
...miracles can happen.

55:07.137 --> 55:10.682
Hello, Lieutenant. Commander.

55:10.765 --> 55:12.392
How may I be of service?

55:12.475 --> 55:15.228
(chuckles)

55:15.311 --> 55:17.731
BURNHAM:
The Chain fractured
without Osyraa.

55:17.814 --> 55:21.151
And the Federation
is continuing to rebuild.

55:21.234 --> 55:23.236
There is a lot of work to do.

55:23.319 --> 55:25.238
It will take time,

55:25.321 --> 55:27.907
but already,
the Trill have rejoined.

55:27.991 --> 55:30.201
Other worlds
are considering it...

55:31.995 --> 55:33.997
...including Ni'Var.

55:36.916 --> 55:40.628
Saru has asked for time
to consider his next steps.

55:40.712 --> 55:43.590
So after this latest round
of talks,

55:43.673 --> 55:49.095
he'll return to Kaminar to
help Su'Kal build a new life.

55:49.179 --> 55:52.265
One where the sky has no
limits

55:52.348 --> 55:55.101
and shines with all
the breadth and wonder

55:55.185 --> 55:57.479
this new future has to offer us.

56:00.815 --> 56:02.525
And as for the rest of us?

56:02.609 --> 56:04.235
Congratulations,
Lieutenant Sahil.

56:04.319 --> 56:06.237
Thank you.

56:09.365 --> 56:11.076
(laughs)

56:12.702 --> 56:15.872
-Commander Burnham.
-Lieutenant Sahil.

56:17.457 --> 56:21.294
You found your way home.

56:21.377 --> 56:23.171
-As did you.
-Hmm.

56:23.254 --> 56:25.423
And I'm so grateful.

56:25.507 --> 56:27.509
Thank you.

56:29.552 --> 56:31.429
Thank you.

56:31.513 --> 56:32.722
(both chuckle)

56:37.352 --> 56:39.354
(chuckles quietly)

56:42.273 --> 56:44.818
You asked to see me, Admiral?

56:44.901 --> 56:45.985
I did.

56:46.069 --> 56:47.654
(laughs softly)

56:49.364 --> 56:53.118
When my daughter
first started studying math,

56:53.201 --> 56:56.496
she refused to use numbers.

56:56.579 --> 56:58.748
She'd draw pictures instead.

56:58.832 --> 57:00.834
I wasn't aware you had a child.

57:00.917 --> 57:05.713
Yeah. She and her mother,
they left a while ago.

57:05.797 --> 57:08.842
Wasn't safe for them here, but,
uh, I will join them one day.

57:08.925 --> 57:10.677
The point being,

57:10.760 --> 57:13.388
she didn't do things
the right way.

57:13.471 --> 57:15.473
She did it her way.

57:15.557 --> 57:17.308
And it worked.

57:19.269 --> 57:21.938
Not long ago,
we were standing right here,

57:22.021 --> 57:25.984
and I was tearing into you
for not doing it the right way.

57:27.902 --> 57:31.531
But I'll be damned
if your way didn't work, too.

57:31.614 --> 57:33.700
Hmm.

57:33.783 --> 57:36.536
Well, I had a lot of help, sir.

57:38.830 --> 57:44.210
You were the one
who wrestled with how to be.

57:44.294 --> 57:47.547
What this time requires of us.

57:47.630 --> 57:50.049
And you challenged me
to do the same.

57:51.968 --> 57:53.553
Have you spoken with Saru?

57:53.636 --> 57:56.514
Yes, sir, I have, b-but...

57:56.598 --> 57:57.974
He wants you
to captain Discovery.

58:00.768 --> 58:02.687
I do, too.

58:09.277 --> 58:11.279
(quietly):
Sir.

58:13.656 --> 58:16.743
I am honored beyond words
that you feel that way.

58:16.826 --> 58:18.369
But if I may,

58:18.453 --> 58:20.538
I'd like to wait
until he's back from Kaminar

58:20.622 --> 58:22.916
before we make any decisions.

58:22.999 --> 58:24.751
Well, time is a luxury
we don't have.

58:24.834 --> 58:28.213
So many worlds have been
struggling since the Burn.

58:28.296 --> 58:29.923
They need the ability
to connect with us,

58:30.006 --> 58:31.424
with one another.

58:31.507 --> 58:34.594
We found a way to mine
the dilithium on that planet.

58:34.677 --> 58:36.930
You and your crew
can bring it to them.

58:37.013 --> 58:39.057
However far away they may be,

58:39.140 --> 58:41.059
you can bring them hope,
Commander Burnham.

58:41.142 --> 58:42.936
They've waited long enough

58:43.019 --> 58:45.480
and, I think, so have you.

58:46.522 --> 58:48.524
So I need an answer.

58:49.525 --> 58:50.652
Now.
