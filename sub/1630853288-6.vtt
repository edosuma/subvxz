WEBVTT

00:09.050 --> 00:10.802
Wayne...

00:12.011 --> 00:14.097
I know what I'm doing.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.326
This proffer session
is for purposes of learning

00:35.410 --> 00:37.912
what you, Sergeant Jenkins,
can offer to the government

00:37.996 --> 00:39.456
as cooperation in the event

00:39.456 --> 00:41.124
you are offered
a plea agreement.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.209
Nothing said today will be
entered in the legal record.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.628
It is instead an opportunity
for you to let us know

00:45.712 --> 00:47.922
the value and extent
of your cooperation,

00:48.006 --> 00:50.091
should we decide
to accept your plea

00:50.175 --> 00:51.801
and recommend
an agreed-upon sentence

00:51.885 --> 00:53.428
to the judge. You understand?

00:54.262 --> 00:57.557
- I do.
- Well then, let's proceed.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.060
Well, first off, I'm innocent.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.107
Sergeant Jenkins, uh,
there's an old and wise saying

01:06.191 --> 01:09.152
in the federal courts that
defendants in criminal cases,

01:09.152 --> 01:11.780
when facing a preponderance
of evidence,

01:11.780 --> 01:15.450
are well-advised
to cooperate early and often.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.118
The first ones to cooperate
get the best deals,

01:17.202 --> 01:19.954
last ones to cooperate
get the worst end of the stick.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.331
You are not early here.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.459
Mm-hmm.
Look...

01:25.960 --> 01:29.005
I'm not gonna sit
in front of you

01:29.005 --> 01:31.966
and tell you that I haven't been
around some bad things. I have.

01:33.092 --> 01:35.094
But I can also tell you

01:35.178 --> 01:36.805
that these things
that you think that I've done,

01:36.805 --> 01:38.973
these things that you've heard
about me, they are false.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.226
Completely false.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.852
Now, is there misconduct
in this department?

01:42.936 --> 01:46.648
Of course there's misconduct,
but I'm not the one you want.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.984
Sergeant, our investigation
is lengthy and detailed,

01:50.068 --> 01:51.903
and the charges against you
are corroborated

01:51.903 --> 01:54.197
by electronic intercepts,

01:54.197 --> 01:55.865
as well as a multitude
of witnesses.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.618
A multitude? Okay, so,
a multitude of witnesses lied.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.246
How about that?
Can I ask you a question?

02:01.246 --> 02:02.997
I am one
of the most talked-about,

02:03.081 --> 02:05.333
most celebrated officers,
history of this city.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.585
Do you not find it odd
that now, all of a sudden,

02:07.669 --> 02:09.587
I'm the mastermind
in this whole thing?

02:09.671 --> 02:11.214
That doesn't strike you
as weird?

02:11.214 --> 02:12.423
They're all lying?

02:14.133 --> 02:15.635
That's what I said.
Mm-hmm.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.720
In the Burley case alone--
Oh, come on,

02:17.804 --> 02:20.223
on the Burley case.
I'm completely innocent on that.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.267
I didn't plant those drugs
on Umar Burley. That wasn't me.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.602
Sergeant Jenkins--
No, no, no. Hang on.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.939
I know who did that.
I know who did it.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.440
And maybe you're right.
You know something,

02:29.524 --> 02:31.192
maybe the fact
that I knew that information,

02:31.276 --> 02:32.694
I didn't report it at the time.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.529
Maybe I was wrong there,
so you got me.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.531
I'm guilty. Hey, you win.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.741
But bottom line is,
I did not plant those drugs

02:38.825 --> 02:41.369
on Umar Burley.
I didn't do it, wasn't me.

02:41.369 --> 02:45.790
For the sake of argument,
you wanna tell us who did?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.921
I do not feel like
telling you that right now.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.758
But I do know for a fact
that it was not Wayne Jenkins

02:55.842 --> 02:57.969
who planted those drugs.
That's what matters here.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.140
This proffer is concluded.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.475
What does that mean,
it's concluded?

03:04.559 --> 03:07.186
Wait, that's it, you guys
just gonna walk away?

03:07.270 --> 03:09.147

any questions for me?

So, Wayne Jenkins
actually thinks

04:50.957 --> 04:53.126
his fellow officers
are gonna hold the line.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.420
When in reality,
they're all in a race

04:55.420 --> 04:57.422

04:57.422 --> 04:59.549
Funny how
he made a point of telling us

he didn't plant the drugs

05:01.384 --> 05:03.177
in the Burley case,

Well, it's not likely
to be Guinn.

Sean Suiter?

05:19.527 --> 05:21.195
You know me
from headquarters, Sean,

05:21.279 --> 05:24.365
but I've been detailed here
to work with the FBI

05:24.449 --> 05:26.367
in public corruption cases.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.995
And Erika here is my supervisor.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.997
The fact is, uh,
we've been working this stuff

05:30.997 --> 05:33.249
involving the city
plainclothes unit, and...

05:34.375 --> 05:35.710
I know you've seen
a lot of people

05:35.710 --> 05:37.170
you work with get arrested.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.755
The thing we want you to know,
right off,

05:38.755 --> 05:41.132
is that you're not necessarily
a target.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.592
Not necessarily?

05:42.592 --> 05:44.886
Well, right now,
we're looking at others,

05:44.886 --> 05:46.554
and we need help with that.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.098
I work murders.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.977
I don't know what you think
I could help you with.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.772
Uh, this is from years ago.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.441
Uh, from the time
you were working VCID.

05:59.358 --> 06:00.526
Hmm.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.819
Do you remember a car chase

06:01.903 --> 06:04.572
involving a suspect
named Burley?

06:04.572 --> 06:08.242
There was a crash,
and a motorist was killed.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.995
Hands! Out of the car!

06:11.079 --> 06:13.539
Jenk, it's on the floor.
Right under the seat.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.834
- This was two thousan--
- I remember. Mm-hmm.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.795
Drugs were discovered
in Burley's vehicle

06:18.795 --> 06:20.129
subsequent to the crash.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.840
Your name is on the
evidence submission paperwork.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.804
So, what are you saying?

06:27.804 --> 06:29.931
One of the witnesses
claims that you're the one

06:29.931 --> 06:31.974
who planted the drugs on Burley.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.811
We don't necessarily believe
this other witness.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.480
Now, this can go two ways, Sean.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.941
Either you know what happened
and how those drugs

06:39.941 --> 06:42.735
got into a car that was already
searched by officers,

06:42.819 --> 06:44.487
in which case
you're a witness.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.573
Or, you become a suspect.

06:47.657 --> 06:48.658
At this point,

06:48.658 --> 06:50.868
it's our assumption
that you are a witness.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.789
Am I gonna
lose my job over this?

07:03.339 --> 07:05.842
<i>End with
the phrase, "Real police work."</i>

07:05.842 --> 07:09.387
<i>Real police work.</i>

07:09.387 --> 07:11.347
Then pick up
with the last paragraph.

07:11.347 --> 07:14.016
- Got it.
- Read that part back to me.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.227
"A consent decree
is not a magic pill.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.896
It is, however, a court-ordered
and enforced mandate

07:18.980 --> 07:21.149
that will compel us
to make necessary improvements

07:21.149 --> 07:23.609
to processes
that have long been neglected.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.902
At times,
it will introduce changes

07:24.986 --> 07:26.988
to our organization
that may cause anxiety.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.949
Police, after all,
do not adjust well to change."

07:31.159 --> 07:32.952
"We must not confuse
time-honored traditions

07:32.952 --> 07:36.372
and the growth necessary
to improve as an organization.

07:36.372 --> 07:39.125
We must honor our traditions,
but not cling to them.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.418
We must embrace changes

07:40.418 --> 07:42.170
that make us
better crime-fighters

07:42.170 --> 07:43.629
and community ambassadors."

07:45.590 --> 07:46.883
"Community ambassadors"?

07:47.884 --> 07:48.968
Gimme a break.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.180
"And not dismiss them
as contrary

07:52.180 --> 07:54.432
to the notion
of real police work."

07:54.432 --> 07:57.643
Good, good. So, that's
on the front page from me.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.438
But inside,
make sure we run the item

08:00.438 --> 08:02.190
on Jenkins
and the Gun Trace Task Force.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.108
Make sure
that's in the newsletter too.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.360

08:06.444 --> 08:07.653
and change, on the one hand,

08:07.737 --> 08:09.030
I've got to acknowledge
the people

08:09.030 --> 08:12.116
who are putting guns
and drugs on the table now,

08:12.200 --> 08:14.410
who are doing the job now.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.413
I don't need those guys
slowing down

08:17.413 --> 08:21.667
or doubting themselves.
I need them out on the streets.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.045
Stop running!

08:24.045 --> 08:25.755
Cut him!

08:29.342 --> 08:31.761
Don't fucking move.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.346
Fuck!
Hands on the hood.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.223
- Hands on the fucking hood.
- Get your fucking hands on the hood.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.099
What you running for, man?
You got that gun?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.935
Saw his gun
over here somewhere.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.895
It's in that garbage
right there, right under the--
that jacked-up Malibu

08:40.895 --> 08:42.313
in that garbage right there.
There ain't no--

08:42.313 --> 08:43.898
Yeah, buddy.
- Hey, man, we know it's yours.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.900
- Ain't no use in lying.
- Yes, sir.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.777
Yeah, we eatin' tonight.
We eatin'.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.528
Good shit, youngster.
Have a seat. On the curb.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.322
I carry that
for protection, man, that's it.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.741

08:53.741 --> 08:56.452
I'm serious, if your life
is in danger, just tell me how.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.120
Tell me how--
I'm happy to look into it.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.747
If someone's trying
to hurt you, kill you,

08:59.747 --> 09:01.457
I'll find--
I'll find out who they are.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.251
All right, tell me, I'll get
another gun off the street.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.586
What's going on, sir? How is your life in danger?
This is 73-45.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.796
Can we get a wagon--

09:06.796 --> 09:09.215
Man, everyone's life
in danger, man. It's Baltimore.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.008
You know what?
That's a good fucking answer,

09:11.092 --> 09:13.511
I like that. I-- You know what,
I like you, man. I like you.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.138
Yo, can I tell someone
I'm being locked up, man?

09:16.222 --> 09:18.140
Maybe get this bail going?

09:18.224 --> 09:20.142
Yeah, man, you're good.

Hang on, let me get this on.

All right,
you're good, you're on.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.199
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>
- Yo, they found a joint in the alley

09:35.283 --> 09:37.785
- and put that bitch on me, yo.
- Come on, man! What the fuck are you--

09:37.785 --> 09:40.121
Why the fuck would you do that?

09:40.121 --> 09:42.665
Honestly, man,
why would you do that?

09:42.665 --> 09:45.376
Have we been cruddy with you?
We ain't cruddy police.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.711
Why would you do that?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.337
We all just saw you
throw that gun

09:48.421 --> 09:50.506
with your own right hand.
We all just saw it.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.674
We don't get down like that.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.843
Ain't the kind
of police work we do.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.386
Can I explain something to you?

09:55.386 --> 09:57.388
If somebody
puts a gun on somebody,

09:57.388 --> 09:59.473
and that gun ain't theirs,
then that cop,

09:59.557 --> 10:02.018
he gets rolled on,
he gets charged.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.519
What you just said
on that telephone,

10:03.519 --> 10:05.396
that was very disrespectful.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.240

11:08.334 --> 11:09.877
All right, well,
then I'm going on the stand,

11:09.877 --> 11:11.128
and I'm gonna tell my story,

11:11.212 --> 11:13.756
and my story is gonna hold.
How about that?

11:23.015 --> 11:24.308
I'm not a dirty cop.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.188
So, Jenkins is still trying
to hold you guys

11:29.188 --> 11:30.314
to staying silent, huh?

11:30.398 --> 11:32.817
He says that video he taped
of us opening the safe

11:32.817 --> 11:34.527
is enough
to knock your case down.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.071
He was saying that
if we all just clam up,

11:37.071 --> 11:39.573
then you feds
can't prove nothing otherwise.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.033
Sergeant has lost it, man.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.785
I've been trying
to get away from Wayne Jenkins

11:42.785 --> 11:44.370
for a while now.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.247
I mean, at first,
it was just about the money,

11:46.247 --> 11:47.415
taking the money. We did that.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.458
We took money
all the time.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.211
That shit happens
all over the fucking department.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.547
Drugs? No.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.215
No, no, no.
Nah, that's different.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.301
The drugs
was like a pain in the ass.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.719
A lot of times,
we would just get up

12:00.803 --> 12:03.139
on the Jones Falls
and toss the dope

12:03.139 --> 12:07.268
and coke out on the expressway. Just...

12:07.268 --> 12:08.394
Just be done with it.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.604
It's easier than driving
down to headquarters

12:10.688 --> 12:13.732
to stand in line
and fill out paperwork at ECU.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.735
Not Sergeant Jenkins, though.
Not Sergeant Jenkins.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.654
Not Wayne, though. No.

12:19.363 --> 12:22.283
Not Wayne Jenkins.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.286
Oh, shit. Oh.

12:25.286 --> 12:29.290
One time, this motherfucker...
This man asked me

12:29.290 --> 12:31.792
if I had any relatives
that would sell drugs

12:31.876 --> 12:33.043
if they got their hands on them.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.795
Like, I understand we in
the streets doing this shit.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.006
My-- my man,
like, that's my fucking family.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.675
What type of cold motherfucker
gonna do that?

12:39.675 --> 12:41.343
I heard him
on the phone once

12:41.427 --> 12:42.470
talking to somebody,

12:42.470 --> 12:44.763
and it was like anything
you hear on the street.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.349
Just another drug transaction.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.518
Wayne went there, man.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.521
He was that dude.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.733
One time, I come in the office,
the Sergeant was in there,

12:55.733 --> 12:57.985
heat-sealing a bag of vials.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.655
I'm talking,
this man was re-sealing cocaine.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.575
Why else would you
be doing that?

13:04.575 --> 13:07.578
Was he selling the stuff
back to dealers?

13:07.578 --> 13:08.787
To Shropshire?

13:08.871 --> 13:11.040
No, I-- I-- I doubt that.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.167
I'd have heard it from Brill.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.044
There was this one guy, though.

13:15.044 --> 13:19.715
He was always showing up places,
always partying with Jenkins.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.467
I mean, this dude
could literally get keys

13:21.467 --> 13:24.803
cut in any car,
or a GPS tracker.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.849
Stuff to, um, bounty hunt,
you know?

13:28.933 --> 13:31.644
Friend of Wayne's
from out in the county.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.813
Some shady-ass white dude.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.191
Bail bondsman. Donald something.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.734
<i>♪ All right ♪</i>

13:38.734 --> 13:41.612
<i>♪ I like the way you move... ♪</i>
We got eyes on him.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.988
Police, search warrant!

13:43.072 --> 13:44.907
Get your hands in the air
and step toward me.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.285
Hands in the air right now.
Let's go, move!

14:00.089 --> 14:01.632
<i>Look, I didn't
order him in any way.</i>

14:01.632 --> 14:03.759
<i>He was completely free
to refuse.</i>

14:03.759 --> 14:05.261
<i>And,
Sergeant Jenkins,</i>

14:05.261 --> 14:07.429
<i>your claim is that,
in undertaking this car stop</i>

14:07.513 --> 14:10.266
involving Mr. Stevenson here,

14:10.266 --> 14:12.476
you only wanted
to speak with him. Correct?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.436
Yes, sir.
So, what did you do

14:14.520 --> 14:16.146
when you approached
the vehicle, Sergeant?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.565
We followed the rules
of probable cause,

14:17.565 --> 14:19.316
that's what we did.
And we do that

14:19.400 --> 14:21.819
because we want our case
to hold up in court.

14:21.819 --> 14:25.072
See, I've-- I've learned from
my past mistakes, Your Honor.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.740
Now, look,
we-- we knew initially

14:26.824 --> 14:28.909
we had no cause
to detain the suspect.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.912
We had no cause to ask him
to exit his vehicle.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.581
So, we-- we, you know,
we talked to him.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.249
Purely on a voluntary basis.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.167
So, where were
the other three officers?

14:37.251 --> 14:40.462
They were-- they were positioned
on all sides of the vehicle.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.797
You surrounded
the vehicle?

14:41.797 --> 14:44.174
Yes, sir. Look, it's a car stop.
You know, it's...

14:44.258 --> 14:46.302
They can go bad. If they go bad,
they go bad quick,

14:46.302 --> 14:48.929
so we need to maintain
tactical advantage at all times,

14:49.013 --> 14:52.391
purely as a precaution.
It's just... That's what we do.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.479
May I approach, Your Honor?
Please.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.403
Did you hear
what he said, Your Honor?

15:04.403 --> 15:06.655
I did
indeed, Mr. Bates.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.908
Officers surrounding a car.
That's pretty compelling.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.161
In fact, I don't see
what I can do here

15:12.161 --> 15:14.580
other than consider
detention without cause.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.748
Thank you, Your Honor.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.002
All right.
Hey, man, good luck.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.670
Thank you.
All right.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.302
I'll catch you later.

15:30.262 --> 15:33.349
Ivan Bates, Ivan Bates.
Beat me again, huh?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.725
Well, you know,
you lost when you said

15:34.725 --> 15:36.352
your guys surrounded the car.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.646
- That amounts to an unlawful detention.
- Shit.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.147
What about the kilos
I seized, huh?

15:40.147 --> 15:41.315
That doesn't bother you?

15:41.315 --> 15:43.442
Nah, man.
Fruits of a poisonous tree.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.943
Know something, man?

15:45.027 --> 15:47.821
Easy come, easy go. Fuck it.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.824
Wait. Look, Wayne, look.
Hold on a second.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.618
I don't know what
you're doing out there, okay?

15:52.618 --> 15:54.286
But everybody tells me
the same thing.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.746
- Huh?
- You rob, you steal,

15:55.746 --> 15:57.164
and you're taking
everybody's money.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.916
Who told you that?
What, your client told you that?

15:58.916 --> 16:01.335
Look, he told me you didn't
turn in all those drugs, okay?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.128
- Okay, man...
- Look, never mind the cash.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.546
But he's not the only one.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.299
- Uh, they're lying.
- Wayne, come on, man.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.928
This was a multi-kilo seizure.
And my guy had priors.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.388
Stevenson's a big dog.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.973
You ever wonder why
this case didn't go federal?

16:15.057 --> 16:16.308
Yeah, think about it.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.894
The US Attorney's Office doesn't
want to touch you anymore.

16:18.894 --> 16:22.189
They want nothing to do
with you. Why would that be?

16:34.868 --> 16:35.869
Well...

16:36.870 --> 16:38.539
there's not a lot
I disagree with here,

16:38.539 --> 16:40.499
but, uh, but then you knew that.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.459
What's the mayor
saying privately?

16:42.543 --> 16:46.088
Uh, supporting it is one thing,
paying for it is another.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.466
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Schools. Rec centers.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.969
The city pension fund
is always bankrupt.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.929
It's-- it's a poor city.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.098
How about we take half the money
the cops burn up

16:56.098 --> 16:59.852
in overtime and court pay
and-- and turn that back

16:59.852 --> 17:02.271
into anti-crime
and community-based programming?

17:02.271 --> 17:03.897
Hey, hey, hey,
I'm on your side, okay?

17:03.981 --> 17:05.065
I know, I just--

17:05.149 --> 17:06.900
I'm just saying
that political will

17:06.984 --> 17:09.486
always falters
at the point where

17:09.570 --> 17:12.531
real money gets used
to solve real problems.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.992
Better get ready for that.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.410
Let me ask you
another question,

17:16.410 --> 17:17.828
and please don't take this
the wrong way,

17:17.828 --> 17:22.082
but what doesn't
this consent decree say?

17:22.833 --> 17:23.959
What do you mean?

17:23.959 --> 17:27.171
Well, I mean,
this is an immense document

17:27.171 --> 17:30.549
showing what the police do
that is wrong procedurally

17:30.549 --> 17:32.760
and unconstitutional.
It cites chapter

17:32.760 --> 17:34.595
and verse,
patterns and practices

17:34.595 --> 17:36.930
that violate civil rights
at best

17:37.014 --> 17:39.308
and brutalize citizens at worst.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.934
And it represents
a lot of hard work

17:41.018 --> 17:42.478
on the part
of you and your team.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.731
- So, credit where credit is due.
- But?

17:45.731 --> 17:49.359
What is it that you can't say
that you need to say?

17:49.443 --> 17:52.905
What is the Justice Department
unwilling to admit?

17:54.656 --> 17:56.283
What are the police
trying to do?

17:58.076 --> 18:00.829
Arrest everybody.
We spoke about this.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.790
I-- I heard you.
Mm-hmm.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.168
But why? What's the mission?

18:10.088 --> 18:11.507
The drug war. Exactly.

18:11.507 --> 18:16.720
And in a war, you need warriors.
In a war, you have enemies.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.848
In a war, civilians get hurt
and nobody does anything.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.850
In a war, you count the bodies

18:21.934 --> 18:23.310
and then
you call them victories.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.145
Is the Justice Department,

18:25.229 --> 18:27.314
or even
the Office of Civil Rights,

18:27.314 --> 18:31.527
ready to declare
that we long ago lost this war?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.864
That we've achieved nothing
but full prisons,

18:35.948 --> 18:39.743
and routine brutality,
and a complete collapse of trust

18:39.827 --> 18:43.539
between police departments
and their cities?

18:43.539 --> 18:47.709
I fought this war, Nicole.
I was even good at it,

18:47.793 --> 18:49.711
and honest when I did it.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.464
But it was lost
when I got there,

18:52.548 --> 18:54.466
and I did nothing but lose
in my time,

18:54.550 --> 18:56.009
and the guys
who are out there right now

18:56.093 --> 18:59.096
on the street,
they all know it's lost.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.640
Are you people ready
to say that out loud?

19:03.141 --> 19:04.184
Is anybody?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.109
They warned me about this.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.861
Warned you about what,
Ms. Mayor?

19:13.861 --> 19:16.363
The money. This is millions more.
- Hmm.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.531
And we're already bleeding out

19:17.531 --> 19:19.533
from all
the departmental overtime.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.868
Where does it end?

19:20.868 --> 19:23.871
You read the same consent decree
that I did.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.373
What they're asking for
isn't going to be possible

19:26.373 --> 19:28.125
without additional budgeting.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.587
The cost of upgrading
the video technology alone is...

19:31.587 --> 19:34.089
- John's run the numbers.
- I was conservative.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.133
But looking only
at what we've agreed to here--

19:36.133 --> 19:37.634
If you look at
the overall fiscal budget,

19:37.718 --> 19:38.969
this can only come from schools,

19:38.969 --> 19:40.262
rec centers,
and after-school programs--

19:40.262 --> 19:43.390
Those are my babies.
It can't come from my babies.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.267
Cut off the overtime pay.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.269
We're 400
positions down right now,

19:47.269 --> 19:49.605
and only one academy class
in the pipeline.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.065
You cut overtime,
patrol cars go empty.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.567
Then find somewhere else to cut.

19:53.567 --> 19:57.237
Your Honor, we're gonna hit
340 murders again this year.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.781
Crime is up in every category,
and I have officers

19:59.865 --> 20:01.408
who won't go out
on the street to police

20:01.408 --> 20:03.243
because of
the Freddie Gray case.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.454
That is the reality
I'm dealing with here.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.747
It's hard to listen

20:06.747 --> 20:08.957
to the police commissioner
plead poverty when we just

20:09.041 --> 20:11.293
paid out a six-and-a-half
million-dollar settlement

20:11.293 --> 20:12.669
to the Gray family.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.672
How many new body cameras
would that money have paid for?

20:15.756 --> 20:18.133
Look, Mosby's decision

20:18.133 --> 20:19.801
to go beyond
the manslaughter case

20:19.885 --> 20:23.472
and charge counts relating
to Gray's arrest

20:23.472 --> 20:27.225
has left me with dozens
of officers resigning,

20:27.309 --> 20:29.436
and others unwilling
to get out of their cars

20:29.436 --> 20:30.854
for fear they'll
be charged criminally

20:30.938 --> 20:33.732
if they even make an honest
Fourth Amendment mistake.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.233
Now, you're telling me
to cut pay

20:35.317 --> 20:37.486
from the guys who are working.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.196
Your job
is to keep crime down

20:39.196 --> 20:40.906
with the resources
that are available.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.199
And with the money
we're spending,

20:42.199 --> 20:43.992
and the crime rate out
of control in Baltimore,

20:44.076 --> 20:45.702
it will no longer be available.

20:46.662 --> 20:50.165
No money from my babies.
Find cuts.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.674
TARIQ TOURÉ: So, this is what
the city agrees to?

if they don't do these things?

21:12.354 --> 21:15.565
I mean, what really happens?

21:16.733 --> 21:19.778
A federal judge
monitors compliance.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.447
If they fail to make
the promised goals,

21:22.531 --> 21:24.157
or the reforms don't happen,

21:24.241 --> 21:26.493
he can hold
the whole city in contempt.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.079
And... then what?

21:30.872 --> 21:32.374
There can be fines,

21:32.374 --> 21:34.918
and the court
can issue additional orders

21:35.002 --> 21:37.504
and demand
that the reforms proceed.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.257
And then what happens?

21:42.884 --> 21:46.388
You're asking me

21:46.388 --> 21:49.850
what happens if the police
don't want to change.

21:50.892 --> 21:54.062
No, I'm saying
that we are the people

21:54.146 --> 21:58.567
the police department hunts,
and kills, and captures.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.403
And you are bringing me
a piece of paper

22:01.403 --> 22:03.488
that says
there's gonna be new rules

22:03.572 --> 22:07.576
on how
they can hunt us?

22:13.498 --> 22:15.333
They're giving you
spit and chewing gum,

22:15.417 --> 22:16.918
and telling you to keep
the whole machine

22:17.002 --> 22:18.253
running with it.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.630
- It doesn't matter.
- Sir?

22:22.049 --> 22:23.133
Watch.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.969
I'll be fired before the
Gun Trace scandal goes to trial.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.431
They're just keeping me around

22:29.431 --> 22:32.934
just long enough
to put that stink on me.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.813
After the last bad headline,
I'm gone.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.365
Let's go!

22:50.077 --> 22:51.078
Copper!

22:52.662 --> 22:54.206
You better open up real quick!

23:01.129 --> 23:03.799
<i>Anyone can put
a juror to sleep</i>

23:03.799 --> 23:05.550
<i>with a closing argument.
Tell me about it.</i>

23:05.634 --> 23:07.636
<i>But when the judge
starts nodding off on you?</i>

23:07.636 --> 23:08.929
<i>He needs to retire.</i>

23:08.929 --> 23:10.263
Anyway, yeah.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.641
So, we'll continue those motion
hearings next week sometime.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.142
- Take a look at the calendar.
- Sounds good.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.728
Hey, Ivan.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

23:16.812 --> 23:19.064
Hey, I'll catch you
downstairs in a minute.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.190
Appreciate you, man.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.027
- Wayne.
- Yeah. You know, Ivan, I...

23:25.529 --> 23:27.364
I respect you, man.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.492
I just want to let you know
that I'm-- I'm done.

23:31.159 --> 23:32.202
Yeah, I'm--

23:32.202 --> 23:34.996
I'm never gonna make another
arrest again, Ivan, so--

23:35.080 --> 23:37.207
Wait, what?
- Yeah. I just...

23:37.207 --> 23:40.961
Fuck this place, man.
And fuck all the shit that,

23:40.961 --> 23:42.212
you know,
people are saying about me.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.547
I don't care
about all that, man.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.173
Just, I--
I got these fucking bosses,

23:45.257 --> 23:47.384
you know, they--
they don't appreciate,

23:47.384 --> 23:48.885
they don't appreciate
a fucking thing.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.179
You know,
I-- I get 'em all these guns.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.140
I'm taking all these risks,
and now I just...

23:53.140 --> 23:56.685
I don't know, man.
I'm just-- I'm done.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.479
I'm gonna go on inside,
be a lieutenant.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.524
Yeah, I just-- You know, man,
I wanted to let you know.

24:03.900 --> 24:08.405
Fuck it.
I'm done. See you around.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.284
I've done
what I can to feel out

24:12.284 --> 24:13.660
the US Attorney on this,
and look,

24:13.660 --> 24:15.328
they're saying
you're not a target here,

24:15.412 --> 24:17.956
- you're a witness.
- Yeah, but what does that mean?

24:17.956 --> 24:20.125
Well, it means they don't think

24:20.125 --> 24:21.877
you planted drugs
in Burley's car.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.670
They think Jenkins is their man.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.755
So why grand jury me?

24:25.839 --> 24:28.842
You were at the scene.
Even if your testimony only

24:28.842 --> 24:30.552
sets the scene
and eliminates you as a suspect,

24:30.552 --> 24:33.889
that's helpful to their case.
But here's the thing, Sean,

24:33.889 --> 24:36.808
I've seen proffer sessions
and grand jury testimony

24:36.892 --> 24:39.311
where things go sideways
because guys didn't anticipate

24:39.311 --> 24:40.687
the things
they might be asked about.

24:41.396 --> 24:42.355
Like what?

24:43.440 --> 24:44.816
Let's not be naïve.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.359
If you heard
that Wayne stole money

24:46.443 --> 24:48.820
or other guys took money,
you're gonna have to tell them.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.822
If they ask you,
you can't hold back.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.035
Serious
fucking police work.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.703
Say about four Gs in drug money.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.955
<i>You know something? I'mma call
it in like that, dawg.</i>

24:59.039 --> 25:00.081
Hmm.

25:11.509 --> 25:15.639
Mr. Stepp, we're from
the FBI Public Corruption Squad.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.266
You don't seem surprised.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.143
Would you be?

25:25.899 --> 25:29.110
How do you know Wayne Jenkins,
a Baltimore police sergeant?

25:29.194 --> 25:32.906
Well, he's a friend of mine.
We hang out.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.617
But that's not what you're here
to talk to me about.

25:38.495 --> 25:41.831
He gave me the drugs I sold.

25:41.915 --> 25:45.502
How-- how much drugs
did Jenkins give you?

25:45.502 --> 25:46.962
More than I could sell.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.214
I mean, it was a million
dollars' worth to us.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.216
Pure profit.
But listen, I'm here to tell you

25:51.216 --> 25:54.302
whatever you wanna know.
Just ask me, I'll cooperate.

25:55.637 --> 25:59.099
Although, you did miss
the cocaine.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.019
We did?
Mm-hmm.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.479
Well, where was it?

26:04.479 --> 26:06.606
Well, it is
under the baseboard radiator

26:06.690 --> 26:09.526
in the laundry room.
Three kilos.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.570
Appreciate that. Truly.

26:12.654 --> 26:13.947
No problem.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.574
Do you realize
what you're asking?

26:16.658 --> 26:19.619
Until there is a change
in national drug policy,

26:19.703 --> 26:21.329
I mean, a complete overhaul,

26:21.413 --> 26:23.540
do you see how impossible
it would be

26:23.540 --> 26:24.874
for us to issue a report?

26:24.958 --> 26:27.335
But without that, we--
We do what we can, Nicole.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.255
We address what we can.
We change what we can.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.465
But even
the Office of Civil Rights,

26:32.549 --> 26:35.593
as high-minded
as we think ourselves to be,

26:35.677 --> 26:37.637
is still a part
of the Justice Department.

26:37.721 --> 26:38.763
And at this point,

26:38.847 --> 26:41.683
federal drug laws
are what they are.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.476
But then everything
in the Baltimore report

26:43.560 --> 26:44.686
is about a symptom.

26:44.686 --> 26:47.564
You don't think we've had
these same conversations?

26:47.564 --> 26:49.190
All the way to the top?

26:49.274 --> 26:52.652
Beginning with the second term,
Holder told all the US Attorneys

26:52.736 --> 26:55.405
to reduce the federal intake
of drug defendants.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.157
And we did that.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.992
So, instead of fixing the laws,

26:58.992 --> 27:01.036
we just quietly
work around them,

27:01.619 --> 27:02.787
until we can't?

27:03.580 --> 27:05.707
Now we're out, Trump is in,

27:05.707 --> 27:08.001
and Jeff Sessions wants
to arrest everyone he can

27:08.001 --> 27:10.503
for fucking
marijuana possession!

27:10.587 --> 27:12.797
I-- I'll never make it
four years. I...

27:12.881 --> 27:15.425
I made sure you were protected.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.052
You're not
a political appointee,

27:17.052 --> 27:18.553
you're in
a civil service posting.

27:18.553 --> 27:23.725
I mean, I can't bear
to sit on my ass for four years,

27:23.725 --> 27:26.394
maybe eight,
while this entire office

27:26.478 --> 27:28.897
is shut down by these assholes.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.900
Tell me I'm wrong.

27:32.901 --> 27:36.821
Tell me
the entire Civil Rights Division

27:36.905 --> 27:40.700
isn't dead in the water
under this new administration.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.325
If I give you eleven hundred dollars...

29:04.409 --> 29:06.870
...you're supposed to give me
eleven hundred dollars' worth.
I don't give a fuck where--

29:09.247 --> 29:10.999
Antonio Shropshire.

29:11.666 --> 29:12.834
Who y'all?

29:12.834 --> 29:15.295
Baltimore County narcotics,
but it's a federal warrant.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.255
Federal, huh?
Yeah, we've been up on you

29:17.255 --> 29:19.841
for like a year and a half,
so, uh, it's a real pleasure

29:19.841 --> 29:21.009
to finally meet you in person.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.344
Can't say the same.
What's the warrant for?

29:23.428 --> 29:25.513
Conspiracy to distribute.
What do we have here?

29:25.597 --> 29:29.476
- Oh, look at that.
- See, that's just bad luck right there.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.311
Had it in my pocket
'cause somebody complained

29:31.311 --> 29:33.938
- and handed it back to me.
- That's very sloppy, Brill.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.607
Bless your heart.
You wanna call your fiancée

29:35.607 --> 29:38.693
- and let her know what's going down?
- Yeah. Her number, 4-4...

29:38.693 --> 29:40.528
No, no, I got it.

29:42.655 --> 29:43.907
Y'all got me on a tap, huh?

29:43.907 --> 29:46.618
<i>Hey, boo.
Why the hell you wake me up?</i>

29:46.618 --> 29:48.495
Y'all motherfuckers cruddy, yo.

29:48.495 --> 29:51.122
Y'all know I got popped
by the city last week, right?

29:51.206 --> 29:55.919
Yup, Gladstone's squad.
We got a superseding indictment.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.379
Y'all working hard here,
but if I were y'all,

29:58.463 --> 30:00.423
I'd get rid of the shit
you just took off me.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.008
Use an informant
or some shit like that

30:02.008 --> 30:03.551
to put it on the street.
Get something nice

30:03.635 --> 30:07.722
for your wives.
Shit, Gladstone took it.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.933
I shit you not.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.109
So, looking
at Sergeant Keith Gladstone,

30:20.193 --> 30:21.277
we not only have the fact

30:21.361 --> 30:22.904
that Shropshire
told county police

30:22.904 --> 30:25.740
that Gladstone took
and resold seized narcotics,

30:25.740 --> 30:28.618
but the fact that he extensively
worked with Jenkins.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.537
Kind of an early mentor.

30:30.537 --> 30:34.874
And if we look back far enough,
we come across this.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.086
Keep in mind that in
searches of unmarked units,

30:38.086 --> 30:40.421
after our arrests
of Hendrix and Rayam,

30:40.505 --> 30:42.674
we also found
several BB pistols.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.509
BB guns?

30:44.509 --> 30:46.761
Hendrix told us
they carried them routinely

30:46.761 --> 30:48.930
in case of a bad shoot
with an unarmed suspect.

30:48.930 --> 30:51.182
So, we go backwards,
looking for cases

30:51.266 --> 30:52.475
involving injuries
to the suspect,

30:52.559 --> 30:56.396
recovered BB pistols,
and, sure enough,

30:56.396 --> 30:58.565
we find a weapons case
with a pursuit

30:58.565 --> 31:01.067
and serious injury
to the suspect,

31:01.776 --> 31:03.236
one Demetric Simon.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.613
Jenkins and another
officer are giving chase

31:05.697 --> 31:07.740
until Jenkins actually
runs the kid over

31:07.824 --> 31:08.908
in his unmarked car,

31:08.992 --> 31:11.786
claiming that the suspect
pointed a gun at him.

31:11.786 --> 31:15.707
A BB gun is later recovered
from under a parked car nearby,

31:15.707 --> 31:16.916
<i>and lucky for us,</i>

31:17.000 --> 31:18.960
<i>one officer who was there
when the gun was found</i>

31:18.960 --> 31:22.463
<i>is none other than Ryan Guinn.</i>

31:22.547 --> 31:25.049
- Refresh my memory.
- Guinn is the plainclothesman

31:25.133 --> 31:26.968
who was an early informant
on this case,

31:26.968 --> 31:28.720
and who we know to be clean.

31:28.720 --> 31:33.558
But Guinn now tells us that
none other than Keith Gladstone

31:33.558 --> 31:36.477
showed up
at this scene, unannounced,

31:36.561 --> 31:38.896
and said openly
to Wayne Jenkins...

31:40.398 --> 31:42.150
"It's over by the truck."

31:42.150 --> 31:44.110
Is Gladstone
still on the street?

31:44.110 --> 31:46.529
He retired quite suddenly.

31:46.613 --> 31:47.864
A few weeks after we started

31:47.864 --> 31:50.408
locking up
other plainclothesmen.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.677
<i>I'm done, LT. I'm done.</i>

32:09.761 --> 32:12.639
<i>Done with Gun Trace,
dealing with all this bullshit.</i>

32:12.639 --> 32:14.682
<i>Now, look, there's this opening
in warrant apprehension.</i>

32:14.766 --> 32:15.767
<i>I want it.</i>

32:15.767 --> 32:17.435
Warrant apprehension?
That's right.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.520
Wayne, are you kidding?

32:19.604 --> 32:20.980
Is this-- is this a joke?

32:21.064 --> 32:22.231
I put my ass on the line.

32:22.315 --> 32:23.983
I-- I get all these fucking guns
for command,

32:24.067 --> 32:26.486
and then they go on
and they... I...

32:28.112 --> 32:31.616
Fuck it. I'm just,
I'm-- I'm-- I'm done.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.826
No one is gonna
be happy about this.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.329
Not the Colonel,
not Deputy Ops.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.331
Wayne, you went on leave
two months ago,

32:38.331 --> 32:40.041
the whole task force
went to sleep.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.834
Bosses noticed.
They want you back working.

32:41.918 --> 32:44.337
You know what they say about me
down at the courthouse?
They talk all this shit.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.047
And I put my head down. Wayne.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.173
I keep on working.

32:47.173 --> 32:48.841
- You know me--
- Who are you talking about?

32:48.925 --> 32:50.051
I'm talking about
the fucking judges

32:50.051 --> 32:51.552
that-- that throw out my cases,

32:51.636 --> 32:54.972
I'm talking about fucking
bitch-ass defense attorneys

32:55.056 --> 32:56.307
that-- that--
that say I'm lying.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.268
Wayne, what else
is a defense attorney gonna say?

32:59.352 --> 33:02.063
What's the fucking point anyway?
Look at what's going on.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.731
I mean, you have
the bosses that go along

33:03.815 --> 33:05.817
with this consent decree,
soft-ass,

33:05.817 --> 33:08.194
fucking baby-boy bullshit.
I mean, how am I supposed

33:08.194 --> 33:10.780
to police like this anyway?
Right. Uh-huh.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.156
Oh, come on,
don't do that.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.616
Don't fucking do that.

33:18.079 --> 33:20.665
Ugh, come the fuck on. What?

33:22.417 --> 33:23.501
"It should go
without saying

33:23.501 --> 33:25.837
that this is
an extremely challenging time

33:25.837 --> 33:27.380
for law enforcement nationally.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.631
Officers are
questioning themselves,

33:28.715 --> 33:29.757
and their role in society

33:29.841 --> 33:31.217
and the changing
law enforcement landscape.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.094
Against this backdrop,
I am extremely proud

33:33.094 --> 33:34.387
to showcase the work
of Sergeant Wayne Jenkins

33:34.387 --> 33:36.806
and the Gun Trace Task Force."

33:36.806 --> 33:38.349
"This team
of dedicated detectives

33:38.433 --> 33:40.226
has a work ethic
that is beyond reproach."

33:40.226 --> 33:42.895
- What are you doing? Why are you reading that shit?
- It's in the goddamn newsletter.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.397
Right.

33:44.397 --> 33:48.067
Wayne, you can put in
for the transfer,

33:48.151 --> 33:50.570
but I'm telling you right now,
there is no way we dump you

33:50.570 --> 33:52.280
in the warrants squad
when your unit is delivering

33:52.280 --> 33:53.489
the way that it is.

33:53.573 --> 33:56.659
- It's not gonna happen.
- Okay.

34:01.247 --> 34:03.791
- ♪ ♪
- I'm telling you right now, man, I cannot be the one

34:03.875 --> 34:05.293
who loses his job
over this shit.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.794
I just can't fucking do it, man.

34:06.878 --> 34:07.962
So now you worried?

34:07.962 --> 34:09.380
It's not that I'm worried.
What you motherfuckers

34:09.464 --> 34:10.798
don't understand is,
I'm sick and tired

34:10.882 --> 34:13.092
of being the one who's always
taking the lead on all of this.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.927
I can't be putting my name
on all this shit.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.262
I just-- I can't do it.

34:16.262 --> 34:19.640
Look, I need to just-- I need
to lay back some, all right?

34:19.724 --> 34:20.767
You won't believe the shit

34:20.767 --> 34:22.185
that I'm hearing
people say, man.

34:22.185 --> 34:25.313
- Down at headquarters, the courthouse.
- Like what?

34:25.313 --> 34:27.273
Motherfuckers saying I'm cruddy.

34:27.273 --> 34:30.234
Like I'm a dirty cop.

34:31.611 --> 34:33.571
Ain't you that?
Don't say that. Why...

34:33.571 --> 34:35.031
How could you
fucking say that shit?

34:35.031 --> 34:36.783
I'm talking about being like,
fucking dirty, for real,

34:36.783 --> 34:38.868
like I'm a bad person.
That's my name, motherfucker.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.453
I can't have my name
out there like that.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.038
Oh, yeah.
Look at ya'll.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.207
Oh, my goodness.
Beautiful. Mm.

34:45.082 --> 34:46.626
I see you.
Look at this.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.753
- Damn.
- Sweetheart, we're good.

34:48.753 --> 34:51.672
- Go on, girl. We're good.
- Do not listen to that man.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.007
- Thank you, sugar.
- Now you happy?

34:53.007 --> 34:54.383
Just go get me
a fucking wine cooler.

34:54.467 --> 34:55.760
The bar's that way. Fuck.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.013
Hey, man, I told you weeks ago
about a federal investigation.

34:59.013 --> 35:00.306
You thought
I was shittin' you, Wayne?

35:00.306 --> 35:02.183
Man, there'll be
no federal investigation.

35:02.183 --> 35:04.560
There's always a rumor
of a federal investigation.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.103
That shit never happens,
it's Baltimore.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.396
It'd take years
to fucking go down.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.148
Look, if they're looking
at cops,

35:09.232 --> 35:10.733
they gonna get cops to talk.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.069
We are some
snitchin' motherfuckers.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.529
Bet.
Don't say that.

35:14.529 --> 35:17.323
Nobody's snitching on nobody.
It's not gonna happen.

35:17.323 --> 35:20.159
Hey, look, look, here's
the bottom line, all right?

35:20.243 --> 35:21.452
Stevenson beat us in court,

35:21.536 --> 35:23.663
so we need to hit his ass again,
right away.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.915
Now, we can do this shit,
but I'm telling you right now,

35:25.915 --> 35:28.501
I need to lay back some.
I do not want my name

35:28.501 --> 35:30.753
on any of the paperwork.
It's gotta be you two.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.799
- How big?
- Big. Huge.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.050
Two hundred Gs.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.468
Two hundred Gs?
Yeah.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.263
At least 200 Gs.
Shit. We can do this, yo.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.806
We can fucking do this,
but it's just gotta

35:41.806 --> 35:43.057
be us, all right?
Rest of the squad,

35:43.057 --> 35:45.017
they cannot know about this.
We keep this tight.

35:45.101 --> 35:48.813
We keep it close. It's just us.
I want your word on that.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.398
- Just us?
- That's right.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.818
Shit. Cool.

35:55.069 --> 35:57.613
You mind if I drink this beer
and stare at some pussy?

35:57.697 --> 35:59.282
Or is this night
all about business?

35:59.282 --> 36:01.284
- I'm trying to, but my man is bugging.
- It ain't right. Relax!

36:01.284 --> 36:04.287
- Relax, nigga. Tightened up!
- Stare at whatever the fuck you wanna stare at.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.621
Somebody get this man
a beer.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.415
Looks like I got a fucking
invisibility cloak on me.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.584
Hey, Brandi,
can I get a fucking wine cooler?

36:28.269 --> 36:29.770
Whoo-hoo!

36:29.854 --> 36:31.522
When's my next chance
at a phone?

36:32.481 --> 36:33.983
Can I get a chance at a phone?

36:39.488 --> 36:41.365
You want me
to get a hold of what now?

36:41.449 --> 36:42.825
<i>Statement of probable cause</i>

36:42.909 --> 36:44.076
<i>for the search of that car.</i>

36:44.869 --> 36:46.245
Why do we need that, man?

36:46.329 --> 36:48.748
<i>Look, I know
Jenkins probably wrote it,</i>

36:48.748 --> 36:50.458
<i>but we should at least know
what was in there</i>

36:50.458 --> 36:52.793
<i>since you searched
the car, right?</i>

36:52.877 --> 36:55.379
<i>We should look at it
before you go into grand jury.</i>

36:55.463 --> 36:56.964
<i>Just pull the probable cause</i>

36:57.048 --> 36:58.633
<i>before you go down
to the courthouse tomorrow.</i>

36:58.633 --> 37:01.510
Okay. Okay.
<i>It's due diligence, that's all.</i>

37:01.594 --> 37:03.137
<i>I'm sure
it's gonna go okay.</i>

37:03.221 --> 37:04.305
Yeah.

37:04.305 --> 37:05.932
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>
All right.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.032
Hey, Sean.
You ready?

37:27.828 --> 37:31.958
You wanna hit another stretch?
Nah.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.417
The best information we have

37:33.501 --> 37:35.586
is that she works the area
around Bennett,

37:35.670 --> 37:37.338
near the expressway. Yeah.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.340
Maybe today you get lucky.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.841
You know, it's always tough
to go back

37:40.925 --> 37:42.093
on a case a year later.

37:52.144 --> 37:54.522
Givens, Antonio.

37:57.066 --> 38:00.027
Possession with intent,
possession and loitering,

38:00.111 --> 38:01.862
Your Honor.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.031
Is a lawyer
for Mr. Givens here?

38:04.115 --> 38:06.325
In the hallway,
I believe, Your Honor.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.327
Consulting on another case.

38:08.411 --> 38:11.706
Okay. Hold on Givens. Next.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.292
Dupont, Jerrod.

38:15.376 --> 38:18.295
Okay, I gotta ask,

38:18.379 --> 38:20.047
what're we doing here
in District Court?

38:20.131 --> 38:22.550
Aaron Soler, representing Mr. Dupont, Judge.
- Look around.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.927
This is an FTA.
What is the original charge?

38:25.011 --> 38:26.637
Look at it.
Possession of cocaine

38:26.721 --> 38:28.306
and possession
of a handgun, Your Honor.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.766
And this
is a second FTA?

38:30.850 --> 38:32.226
Bail is revoked.

38:32.226 --> 38:34.478
Judge, my client--
Save it, Mr. Soler.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.897
You get one bite
of the FTA apple.

38:36.981 --> 38:41.068
We've built this machine
where half the damn country,

38:41.152 --> 38:45.072
the part with money and power,
chew up the other half

38:45.156 --> 38:46.741
that didn't have anything
to begin with.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.034
Next.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.036
Vinson, DeShawn.
- Watch it work.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.996
If this is what we want...
Possession with intent.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.373
- Resisting arrest.
- ...then the Freddie Grays,

38:54.457 --> 38:57.460
the Eric Garners,
the Michael Browns

38:57.460 --> 38:58.794
are what we get.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.755
How do you plead?
Not guilty.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.758
And every page of whatever
court order we write...

39:03.758 --> 39:05.426
...I'm going
to deny bail at this time.

39:05.426 --> 39:09.096
...it won't fix it.
Is that the last of the lockup?

39:09.180 --> 39:10.931
Yes, Your Honor.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.559
I thought you said you didn't
make it your everything.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.021
Next.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.609
Bullock, Keandra.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.903
Possession
of a concealed weapon.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.947
Possession with intent.
Assaulting a police officer.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.824
So, you even gonna know
where to see her?

39:29.658 --> 39:31.202
I got a general description.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.622
- Name of Mary?
- Yeah.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.416
No last name. No street name.
Just--

39:37.500 --> 39:38.584
Just a street whore named Mary

39:38.584 --> 39:40.419
who knows something
about the case.

39:40.503 --> 39:43.130
It ain't much, but it's worth
a shake or two, right?

39:47.051 --> 39:48.385
Hey.
<i>Hey, Sean.</i>

39:48.469 --> 39:49.428
I can't talk right now.

39:49.512 --> 39:50.930
- Take a left on Schroeder.
- All right.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.938
- Hey, what the fuck was that?
- What, you saw something?

39:59.688 --> 40:01.357
Where, down the alley?

40:34.265 --> 40:35.599
You sure you saw something?

40:36.934 --> 40:39.562
A dude wearing leather,
squatting down.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.856
Said you saw a jacket
with a white stripe, right?

40:41.856 --> 40:42.982
Yeah.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.442
Sean, man,
I think we might have seen

40:44.442 --> 40:45.985
that pile of trash right there.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.904
Mistaken it for a guy
all hunched over.

40:48.988 --> 40:51.490
Well, he's gone now.
Or he's gone to ground.

40:51.574 --> 40:53.909
Let's roll back around
and see who's here.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.098
Let's swing back in 20.

41:17.933 --> 41:19.560
In the meantime,
let me show you something.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.103
Sure.

41:32.239 --> 41:34.158
This was my old post,
right here.

41:35.492 --> 41:36.744
Seven twenty-three.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.008
Nothing like
your first post, right?

41:51.008 --> 41:52.384
No.

41:54.011 --> 41:55.596
What the fuck
you doing, yo?

42:02.186 --> 42:04.021
Let's try out the alley
one last time.

42:19.495 --> 42:20.579
Why resign?

42:22.331 --> 42:23.374
Why go that far?

42:24.291 --> 42:26.460
If all you need is a vacation...

42:26.460 --> 42:27.962
Trump's gonna give us that.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.923
Relax, Nic.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.217
This is about
more than that.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.177
Wait a minute.
So, my orientation ends

42:35.261 --> 42:38.973
with my advisor telling me we're
not doing anything that matters?

42:38.973 --> 42:42.017
- That's what you're saying?
- I didn't say that.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.603
Then what are you saying?

42:57.074 --> 42:59.702
I'm saying...

43:02.037 --> 43:04.123
It's your turn, motherfucker.

43:16.927 --> 43:18.637
Fuck it,
Sean, it's 4:30 now.

43:18.721 --> 43:19.847
It's quitting time, ain't it?

43:32.651 --> 43:33.986
You sure you saw something?

43:33.986 --> 43:35.612
There was movement, yeah.

43:35.696 --> 43:38.240
I saw a guy ducking out
of the alley when we pulled up.

43:40.659 --> 43:42.161
Tell you what, you go up
and around the corner

43:42.161 --> 43:43.662
in case he makes his way out
onto Schroeder.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.331
- All right.
- I'll see if he pops out here.

43:45.331 --> 43:46.457
You got it.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.641
Stop! Police, stop!

44:48.894 --> 44:50.020
Sean!

44:53.399 --> 44:54.566
Sean!

45:01.824 --> 45:02.908
Sean!

45:14.336 --> 45:16.630
This is 70-4-20 Unit
calling a Signal 13

45:16.630 --> 45:17.881
at Bennett and Schroeder.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.634
Shots fired. Officer down.
My partner is hit!

45:20.634 --> 45:22.970
You kinda mentored Wayne Jenkins

45:22.970 --> 45:25.389
- when he first got to plainclothes, right?
- Yeah.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.641
We worked together.
I helped break him in.

45:27.641 --> 45:30.727
But, truth is, I wasn't all
that close with Wayne.

45:32.396 --> 45:35.065
So, why would you throw away
your whole career

45:35.149 --> 45:37.734
to plant that BB gun for him?

45:37.818 --> 45:40.737
I'm talking about
the Anntana Avenue incident.

45:40.821 --> 45:43.323
Yeah, I didn't come
from the greatest home.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.659
When I was coming up,
I had brothers.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.202
We were very close,

45:47.286 --> 45:49.288
and that's how
we got through it.

45:49.288 --> 45:54.460
I got out, joined the military,
camaraderie again.

45:54.460 --> 45:58.380
Got in the police department,
camaraderie. It's just, uh...

45:59.506 --> 46:03.427
Eh, you know, John.

46:03.427 --> 46:06.847
You go into these situations,
and there is always

46:06.847 --> 46:09.349
this person right behind you.

46:09.433 --> 46:14.980
So, he called me.
Asked me for help. I did it.

46:14.980 --> 46:16.648
And I threw away everything
to do it

46:16.732 --> 46:18.859
because I thought
he'd do it for me.

46:18.859 --> 46:20.986
So, you thought of him
as a brother?

46:20.986 --> 46:24.156
Well, I consider
pretty much most police

46:24.156 --> 46:25.908

46:37.628 --> 46:39.046
OFFICER 1: Where the fuck
is the ambulance?

46:39.046 --> 46:40.547
OFFICER 2: He can't wait,
he's bleeding out!

46:40.631 --> 46:42.299
Fuck the ambo.
Get him in the back of a car

46:42.299 --> 46:43.842
and drive him to shock trauma.
This can't wait.

46:43.926 --> 46:45.302
OFFICER 3: Get his head.
Get his head!

46:45.302 --> 46:46.970
OFFICER 4: Get his shoulders!

46:47.054 --> 46:49.473
- Grab his feet.
- OFFICER 3: Everybody, go! Everybody, go! Everybody back.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.517
- OFFICER 4: Move, move!
- OFFICER 3: Go, go, go, go, go.

46:51.517 --> 46:53.519
OFFICER 5: Anybody you see,
hold 'em.

46:58.023 --> 47:00.359
- Description. Height, weight.
- Go, go, go!

47:00.359 --> 47:01.860
I didn't see anyone.

47:01.944 --> 47:04.821
- The shooter--
- I got here so fast, man, I...

47:04.905 --> 47:06.532
I could see the gun smoke
above him

47:06.532 --> 47:07.658
where he was laying.

47:09.076 --> 47:10.202
I didn't see anybody.

47:10.202 --> 47:12.538
- But you heard the shots.
- Yeah, I heard three,

47:12.538 --> 47:14.540
maybe four shots. One of them
might have been an echo.

47:14.540 --> 47:17.543
He shouted, "Stop, police."
Then the shots.

47:17.543 --> 47:19.628
His leg was still moving
when I got here, man.

47:19.628 --> 47:20.754
I was just coming
from the corner.

47:20.754 --> 47:22.172
I was here
within three to four seconds.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.924
Where was the gun?

47:24.883 --> 47:26.093
Under his right shoulder.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.680
Radio too.
When-- when backup got here

47:29.680 --> 47:31.139
and we rolled him,
he was still holding

47:31.223 --> 47:33.183
his radio in his left hand.

47:33.267 --> 47:35.435
He's fighting a suspect
for a gun in his right hand,

47:35.519 --> 47:36.895
but doesn't drop
the fucking radio

47:36.979 --> 47:38.689
- in his left hand?
- Or hit the guy with it?

47:45.529 --> 47:48.615
Hines. Yeah, he's here with me.

47:50.951 --> 47:52.035
Wise here.

47:55.080 --> 47:57.040
Jesus. Just now?

47:59.459 --> 48:00.460
Thank you.

48:04.089 --> 48:05.424
Sean Suiter's been shot.

48:06.383 --> 48:07.968
He's in shock trauma.

48:07.968 --> 48:09.761
It doesn't look good.
Head wound.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.141
We were gonna
grand jury him tomorrow.

48:14.141 --> 48:15.726
He's supposed
to report at 11:00.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.521
No reason to assassinate him.

48:19.605 --> 48:20.897
Half these guys
are pleading,

48:20.981 --> 48:23.442
and the ones who aren't
are cooked by the ones who are.

48:23.442 --> 48:26.111
Suiter's testimony
was in no way critical.

48:26.111 --> 48:28.113
He was told he wasn't a target.

48:31.116 --> 48:32.242
Rayam's gonna...

48:33.368 --> 48:36.455
name him
as taking money back in VCID.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.665
Yeah, but is that enough
for him to--

48:38.749 --> 48:43.003
Yeah. For a cop, yeah.

48:59.269 --> 49:00.687
<i>And also,
the right to be free</i>

49:00.771 --> 49:03.815
from incarceration due to
a law enforcement officer's

49:03.899 --> 49:05.567
willful failure to disclose

49:05.651 --> 49:08.862
exculpatory evidence
to a prosecutor.

49:08.862 --> 49:11.156
How do you wish to plead
to counts one through six

49:11.156 --> 49:12.866
of the superseding indictment?

49:12.866 --> 49:14.201
Guilty, ma'am.

49:14.201 --> 49:15.994
Do you agree, sir,
that the statement of facts

49:16.078 --> 49:17.245
is correct?

49:18.580 --> 49:20.707
I do, Your Honor,
except, there is, uh--

49:20.791 --> 49:23.418
Your Honor, we are agreeing
to the statement of facts

49:23.502 --> 49:25.253
with the exception
of one correction.

49:25.337 --> 49:26.838
In the matter
of the Burley arrest,

49:26.922 --> 49:28.882
he is not acknowledging
he planted the drugs,

49:28.882 --> 49:31.301
although he is acknowledging
he wrote a false report

49:31.385 --> 49:33.428
with respect to another officer
planting those drugs.

49:33.512 --> 49:35.055
Noted
for the record, Mr. Levin.

49:35.055 --> 49:36.473
We can acknowledge...

49:36.473 --> 49:39.351
We just watched him put that sin
on Ryan Guinn and Sean Suiter.

49:39.351 --> 49:40.686
Well, we know it's not Guinn.

49:40.686 --> 49:43.563
And Suiter's not here
to defend himself at this point.

49:43.647 --> 49:46.233
Any questions at all, sir,
for me or your lawyer

49:46.233 --> 49:47.484
about your guilty pleas

49:47.484 --> 49:49.528
or the terms
of your plea agreement?

49:50.404 --> 49:52.989
No, ma'am. Uh, just...

49:54.658 --> 49:59.871
I've-- I've made a lot
of mistakes here, Your Honor.

49:59.955 --> 50:05.252
In my life, if I make a mistake,
I own it. I say, "I'm sorry."

50:05.252 --> 50:08.880
That's-- that's not gonna
cut it today.

50:08.964 --> 50:10.215
I want you to know that,

50:10.215 --> 50:12.592
you know, I feel very bad
for the things that I've done.

50:12.676 --> 50:15.637
And, uh, that I've lost
my chance to be a father.

50:17.806 --> 50:19.099
To raise my boys.

50:23.103 --> 50:26.356
I'm ashamed of myself,
Your Honor. That's it.

50:26.440 --> 50:29.401
Furthermore, Your Honor,
I would just like to say

50:29.401 --> 50:32.112
that in the nearly 25 years
that I've known Wayne...

50:32.112 --> 50:34.239
- Why would he take that plea?
- ...I can without uncertainty tell you

50:34.239 --> 50:36.491
- that this man will learn...
- I thought he wanted his day in court?

50:36.575 --> 50:38.326
- ...from his mistakes.
- You ask me, it was Stepp,

50:38.410 --> 50:39.911
the bail bondsman.

50:39.995 --> 50:41.329
Once he started talking...

50:41.413 --> 50:43.248
He will use this experience to do better.
- Well,

50:43.248 --> 50:44.791
that means Wayne Jenkins

50:44.875 --> 50:46.668
isn't just a thief.
Thank you for your time, Your Honor.

50:46.752 --> 50:49.880
- He's a drug dealer.
- Worse, they partied together.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.299
Stepp puts him
with strippers and hookers.

50:52.299 --> 50:54.176
This way, he stays a family man.

50:55.093 --> 50:57.512
All rise!

51:03.560 --> 51:08.023
I love you.

51:22.370 --> 51:25.373
<i>This is a dysfunctional
police department.</i>

51:25.457 --> 51:27.334
I am telling you,
as a person who has seen

51:27.334 --> 51:29.503
what a healthy organization
looks like,

51:29.503 --> 51:31.171
this is not one of them.

51:31.171 --> 51:33.131
Will the defendant
please rise.

51:34.758 --> 51:37.177
Mr. Rayam,
considering your cooperation

51:37.177 --> 51:38.595
after your guilty plea,

51:38.595 --> 51:41.139
this court sentences you
to 12 years.

51:41.223 --> 51:43.517
<i>Are you blaming this
on your predecessors?</i>

51:43.517 --> 51:47.103
Well, this department has had
four commissioners

51:47.187 --> 51:48.522
over the last eight years.

51:48.522 --> 51:51.274
So, there hasn't been continuity
in leadership here.

51:51.358 --> 51:53.235
Mr. Gondo,

51:53.235 --> 51:55.946
due to your cooperation
after your guilty plea,

51:55.946 --> 51:58.031
the court sentences you
to ten years.

51:58.031 --> 52:00.283
All rise.

52:05.288 --> 52:07.582
This is happening now,
on my watch,

52:07.666 --> 52:10.544
and I am taking responsibility
as the police commissioner.

52:12.629 --> 52:14.923
Mr. Ward and Mr. Hendrix,

52:14.923 --> 52:17.551
having plead guilty
and subsequently cooperated

52:17.551 --> 52:20.387
by agreeing to testify
against other officers,

52:20.387 --> 52:22.848
this court sentences you each
to seven years.

52:26.184 --> 52:29.396
I've moved
to end plainclothes policing,

52:30.188 --> 52:31.398
and we've undertaken a plan

52:31.398 --> 52:33.650
to track the quality
of gun cases

52:33.650 --> 52:38.780
to see how they fare in court
rather than just tallying stats.

52:38.864 --> 52:40.365
We are already responding.

52:43.118 --> 52:44.953
Mr. Allers,
you have been found guilty,

52:44.953 --> 52:47.122
and since you've refused
to cooperate,

52:47.122 --> 52:49.666
the court sentences you
to 15 years.

52:51.585 --> 52:52.919
<i>But federal investigators say</i>

52:53.003 --> 52:54.671
this has been going on
for years.

52:54.671 --> 52:55.755
Uh, shouldn't the leadership

52:55.839 --> 52:57.215
of the police department
have known?

52:57.299 --> 53:00.385
Well, Justin,
speaking for myself and my team,

53:00.385 --> 53:02.971
we inherited a culture

53:02.971 --> 53:06.141
that looks at accountability
as a four-letter word.

53:06.141 --> 53:09.060
And that's years and years
of neglect.

53:09.144 --> 53:11.521
Years and years
of chasing after the two H's,

53:11.605 --> 53:12.898
homicide and heroin.

53:14.941 --> 53:17.694
Should someone have known
about this kind of corruption?

53:18.737 --> 53:20.405
Absolutely.
They should have known.

53:20.405 --> 53:21.615
"They" should have known?

53:23.742 --> 53:25.201
We should have known.

53:56.775 --> 53:59.361
<i>Crime is spilling out

53:59.361 --> 54:00.904
<i>and we've got to focus.</i>

54:00.904 --> 54:02.614
And while we are grateful
for the efforts

54:02.614 --> 54:05.075
of Commissioner Davis
and his team,

54:05.075 --> 54:08.244
we need to move forward
in a new direction.

54:08.328 --> 54:11.206
Commissioner Darryl De Sousa.

54:11.206 --> 54:13.750
Thank you.

54:16.086 --> 54:18.672
Change is coming to
the Baltimore Police Department.

54:19.506 --> 54:21.549
And let me make it clear,

54:21.633 --> 54:25.011
I have zero tolerance
for corruption.

54:28.098 --> 54:29.766
<i>We're gonna be doing proactive,</i>

54:29.766 --> 54:31.267

<i>We're gonna have

<i>with the entire community.</i>

54:52.789 --> 54:55.542
Your Honor, as a point of law,
it's Mr. Hersl's contention

54:55.542 --> 54:58.420
that he is not guilty
of the charge of extortion

54:58.420 --> 55:01.715
for taking money from citizens
subsequent to their arrest.

55:01.715 --> 55:03.633
No?

55:03.717 --> 55:05.468
He was
responsibly taking that money

55:05.552 --> 55:07.012
as an agent of the state,
Your Honor.

55:07.012 --> 55:10.390
His crime is instead that
of failing to deliver that money

55:10.390 --> 55:11.808
to the Evidence Control Unit.

55:11.808 --> 55:13.852
Therefore,
he is guilty only of theft,

55:13.852 --> 55:15.687
not of extortion or conspiracy.

55:15.687 --> 55:17.897

59:46.374 --> 59:48.668
<i>That's the other thing
with being brutal,</i>

59:48.668 --> 59:51.462
<i>not only does it get in the way
of getting good cases,</i>

59:51.546 --> 59:52.588
<i>but beating on people,</i>

59:52.672 --> 59:55.466
you're gonna get
IAD complaints, files.

59:55.550 --> 59:58.136
Maybe even a reputation,
get enough complaints,

59:58.136 --> 1:00:00.138
get transferred
out of your unit.

1:00:00.138 --> 1:00:03.224
And even if you can write
your way out of the hassle,

1:00:03.308 --> 1:00:04.851
most police
worth a shit can write

1:00:04.851 --> 1:00:06.894
their way out
of pretty much anything.

1:00:06.978 --> 1:00:09.564
Look, it just-- it gets you
the kind of attention

1:00:09.564 --> 1:00:11.691
that only makes it harder
to do the job.

1:00:11.691 --> 1:00:13.443
If beating on people
made cases, shit,

1:00:13.443 --> 1:00:15.653
I'd tell you, "Go out there
and kick everybody's ass,"

1:00:15.737 --> 1:00:17.488
but it just-- it does not work.

1:00:17.572 --> 1:00:19.449
So, if that's the kind
of work you wanna do,

1:00:19.449 --> 1:00:20.533
I'm gonna tell you right now,

1:00:20.533 --> 1:00:23.077
you're not coming
anywhere near my unit.

1:00:23.161 --> 1:00:26.122
Gun Trace Task Force,
we are not about that bullshit.

1:00:26.581 --> 1:00:27.582
Make no mistake.

1:00:27.582 --> 1:00:30.168
We're about
getting guns and drugs.

1:00:30.168 --> 1:00:31.461
We're about getting
the motherfuckers

1:00:31.461 --> 1:00:33.671
that deal the drugs
and shoot the guns.

1:00:33.755 --> 1:00:37.133
That's what we do.
That's what we deliver.

1:00:37.133 --> 1:00:39.469
Gun Trace Task Force,
we get those guns,

1:00:39.469 --> 1:00:41.512
and we put 'em on the table.

1:00:41.596 --> 1:00:45.141
We get that dope,
and we put it on the table.

1:00:45.141 --> 1:00:47.977
My unit took 132 guns
off the street

1:00:48.061 --> 1:00:51.189
in nine months of work.
We got 59 cases charged.

1:00:51.189 --> 1:00:53.941
Every single one of those
went up to Calvert Street.

1:00:54.025 --> 1:00:56.694
During that time,
we kicked in 45 doors.

1:00:56.778 --> 1:00:59.364
We got in over
a kilo weight of dope and coke.

1:00:59.364 --> 1:01:02.533
Not to mention the pills
and all else. We took all that,

1:01:02.617 --> 1:01:05.953
and we put it on the table.
That's what we do.

1:01:07.914 --> 1:01:09.165
That's what we deliver.

1:01:11.876 --> 1:01:13.002
That's the job.

1:01:18.341 --> 1:01:19.967
And you take care of each other.

1:01:22.136 --> 1:01:23.221
I'm proud of you.

1:01:32.105 --> 1:01:35.483
Yeah, everybody!

1:01:39.153 --> 1:01:40.405
Who wants to get some?

1:01:40.405 --> 1:01:43.241
I wanna fucking get some!
Let me hear it!

1:01:44.575 --> 1:01:46.160
Who wants to get some?

1:01:48.287 --> 1:01:52.250
