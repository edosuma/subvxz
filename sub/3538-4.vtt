City of Angels.

00:07.095 --> 00:09.387
Sister Molly
was fucking Hazlett.

00:09.470 --> 00:10.637
You don't know that.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.053
Take the valise.
You run it down

00:12.136 --> 00:13.637
and tell me I'm wrong.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.345
My boy Tom
is having a birthday party

00:15.428 --> 00:17.053
this Sunday.
Bring Frank,

00:17.136 --> 00:19.053
and he will have friends.
Do say you'll come, yeah?

00:19.136 --> 00:21.136
No, no.

00:21.220 --> 00:22.303
Councilwoman Beck's
opened fire

00:22.387 --> 00:23.804
on me and the motorway.

00:23.887 --> 00:25.011
We need to do something
about her.

00:25.095 --> 00:27.595
Really, sir, your audacity
is truly as Herculean

00:27.679 --> 00:28.887
as your appetite.

00:28.970 --> 00:30.512
You know what he'll do now.

00:30.595 --> 00:31.845
Let him sneak
a chocolate malt.

00:31.929 --> 00:33.470
If it were only a malt.

00:33.553 --> 00:35.970
You need to conclude
the Hazlett case.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.011
You want us to conclude
the Hazlett case,

00:38.095 --> 00:39.512
not solve it?

00:39.595 --> 00:41.303
That is entirely correct.

00:41.387 --> 00:42.720
What are you crying about?

00:44.637 --> 00:46.053
Officer Reilly.

00:46.136 --> 00:46.970
I never seen
anything like it.

00:47.053 --> 00:49.470
He was so smooth.

00:49.553 --> 00:51.095
Brother, when are we
gonna get active?

00:51.178 --> 00:52.512
We have to fight.

00:52.595 --> 00:53.637
- First we make them look.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.053
Then we make them scared.

04:20.387 --> 04:23.470
Get back! Get back!

04:31.679 --> 04:33.178
What the fuck?

04:33.261 --> 04:34.595
It's got nothing
to do with you.

04:34.679 --> 04:36.011
You cuffed him to a chair?

04:36.095 --> 04:38.679
Cocksucker tried to bite me.

04:38.762 --> 04:41.095
Stay away from him,
or I'll fucking kill you!

04:41.178 --> 04:44.053
Detective!
My office.

04:44.136 --> 04:45.929
Reilly, put him back
in the pen,

04:46.011 --> 04:48.887
and get the blood off him.
Jesus Christ.

04:58.553 --> 05:01.553
Are we arresting every goddamn
Chicano in the city?

05:01.637 --> 05:02.762
You want me to go
into the cells?

05:02.845 --> 05:03.804
Sit down and shut up.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.178
Close the door.

05:18.929 --> 05:20.261
Look at them, Detective.

05:20.345 --> 05:22.887
I've seen them.

05:22.970 --> 05:24.637
Look at them.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.136
What are the kids' names?

05:27.220 --> 05:29.428
- Detect--
- Steve and Marion.

05:29.512 --> 05:30.929
Steve's about the same age

05:31.011 --> 05:32.804
as that boy you had cuffed
to a chair.

05:32.887 --> 05:35.011
Officer Reilly was
interrogating a suspect,

05:35.095 --> 05:36.553
and he'll go on doing that

05:36.637 --> 05:38.095
till he gets someone
to confess.

05:38.178 --> 05:39.804
What the hell
are you doing, Detective?

05:42.011 --> 05:44.512
Lewis said Hazlett might have
been cooking the books,

05:44.595 --> 05:46.845
shacking up with some gal
in a love nest, right?

05:48.178 --> 05:49.637
I'm running it down.

05:49.720 --> 05:50.637
When's Lewis back?

05:50.720 --> 05:51.804
Couple of days, he said.

05:51.887 --> 05:54.303
Oh, Jesus, you two.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.512
Work the case.

05:56.595 --> 05:59.428
Give me something, Tiago.

05:59.512 --> 06:00.804
Will you stop
the interrogations?

06:00.887 --> 06:03.303
Give me a reason to.

06:03.387 --> 06:04.970
Go do your job.
Dismissed.

06:20.553 --> 06:21.970
So I'm pleased
to report

06:22.053 --> 06:23.679
that Via Hermosa Development
has agreed

06:23.762 --> 06:26.011
to take over the construction
of the motorway

06:26.095 --> 06:27.053
at no additional cost.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.261
We should be able
to break ground

06:29.345 --> 06:30.595
as soon
as the full City Council

06:30.679 --> 06:32.261
votes next month.

06:32.345 --> 06:34.178
I expect the Council
will approve

06:34.261 --> 06:36.136
our recommendations in full

06:36.220 --> 06:37.345
because they understand

06:37.428 --> 06:39.261
the Maynard West
Memorial Motorway

06:39.345 --> 06:42.011
will begin the process
of healing this city

06:42.095 --> 06:46.387
and will be a legacy
of which we can all be proud.

06:46.470 --> 06:48.011
Now, if there's nothing else...

06:48.095 --> 06:51.512
Point of order,
Mr. Chairman.

06:51.595 --> 06:53.428
Councilwoman Beck?

06:54.387 --> 06:56.345
You know what's interesting?

06:56.428 --> 06:58.178
I took a little drive
out to Belvedere Heights

06:58.261 --> 07:00.679
the other day,
stretch my legs a bit,

07:00.762 --> 07:03.470
and something
sort of struck me.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.512
Ken, if you will.

07:05.595 --> 07:07.929
♪ uneasy music ♪

07:15.136 --> 07:17.387
Now, you all recognize
this line here.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.303
That's the route
of the motorway.

07:19.387 --> 07:21.845
But I talked to some engineers,

07:21.929 --> 07:23.470
put some questions to them,

07:23.553 --> 07:26.261
and those clever gentlemen
came up with this.

07:29.387 --> 07:31.762
As you can see, this route

07:31.845 --> 07:33.637
entirely bypasses
Belvedere Heights

07:33.720 --> 07:35.220
and goes
through the hills here,

07:35.303 --> 07:37.679
the hills
where no one lives

07:37.762 --> 07:40.637
but a few coyotes
and jackrabbits,

07:40.720 --> 07:42.970
none of whom vote.

07:43.053 --> 07:45.053
Now, I'll grant you this.

07:45.136 --> 07:47.261
It'll add about four minutes

07:47.345 --> 07:49.679
to the drive to Pasadena.
Four minutes.

07:49.762 --> 07:52.470
But if our goal
is truly to heal this city,

07:52.553 --> 07:54.428
as you said,
Mr. Chairman,

07:54.512 --> 07:56.762
I can't imagine
those four minutes

07:56.845 --> 07:59.595
will make much of a difference.

07:59.679 --> 08:00.679
Don't you agree?

08:01.762 --> 08:05.095
And after speaking
with my many old friends

08:05.178 --> 08:07.470
on the City Council
and in the mayor's office,

08:07.553 --> 08:10.845
I can assure you,
they also agree.

08:10.929 --> 08:13.136
Sir, we can fight this,
put our own engineers--

08:13.220 --> 08:15.261
Cancel my speech tonight.

08:15.345 --> 08:17.095
Oh, we can't cancel
this evening, sir. We need--

08:17.178 --> 08:18.595
Do what I tell you, woman!

08:32.637 --> 08:34.303
This Nazi--
I know he killed them.

08:34.387 --> 08:36.136
I just can't prove it yet.

08:36.220 --> 08:39.553
So what do you do now
about Anton and Sam?

08:41.053 --> 08:44.011
I talk...

08:44.095 --> 08:45.637
to Benny Berman.

08:49.637 --> 08:50.720
This doesn't surprise you?

08:52.387 --> 08:54.929
You know who was president
when I was born?

08:55.011 --> 08:57.428
Ulysses S. Grant.

08:57.512 --> 08:59.387
Not a lot surprises me.

08:59.470 --> 09:01.303
But this is a gangster
you're talking about.

09:01.387 --> 09:02.595
- He's a Jew.
- You better hope

09:02.679 --> 09:05.470
he's a good Jew.

09:05.553 --> 09:10.136
This is about a lot more
than Anton and Sam now.

09:10.220 --> 09:11.720
These Germans...

09:14.303 --> 09:15.679
It's terrible, what I know.

09:15.762 --> 09:18.512
I need help.

09:18.595 --> 09:19.595
You got me.

09:21.011 --> 09:22.053
I know.

09:22.136 --> 09:23.053
Lewis,

09:23.136 --> 09:24.512
this Benny Berman--

09:24.595 --> 09:26.261
you be careful.

09:26.345 --> 09:29.428
At my age, I can't afford
to lose any more friends.

09:53.845 --> 09:55.804
No, no, no, no.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.887
That is Old World,
19th-century thinking.

09:57.970 --> 09:59.595
The Bund has to get
on the radio.

09:59.679 --> 10:02.303
We can make as many speeches
as we want in Pershing Square.

10:02.387 --> 10:04.428
Who hears us?
A handful.

10:04.512 --> 10:07.095
We get on the radio,
who hears us?

10:07.178 --> 10:09.303
Everyone, all at once.

10:09.387 --> 10:12.011
The Jews own the radio.

10:12.095 --> 10:14.845
Not the Catholic stations.
We talk to them.

10:14.929 --> 10:17.887
We talk to the Episcopals.
We talk to the Baptists.

10:17.970 --> 10:19.470
We talk to that woman
with the temple.

10:19.553 --> 10:22.053
So now you have us working
with a radio show cult, huh?

10:23.178 --> 10:24.428
With the devil himself,

10:24.512 --> 10:25.553
if he will give us
a microphone.

10:32.637 --> 10:33.845
You will excuse me.

10:42.679 --> 10:44.136
So pleased you could come.

10:44.220 --> 10:45.679
Yeah, you're good
to ask us.

10:45.762 --> 10:47.595
You have a beautiful home.
My heavens.

10:47.679 --> 10:49.762
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, yeah.

10:49.845 --> 10:51.428
Hey, Frank.

10:51.512 --> 10:52.637
- Hello.
- Come on over.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.887
We've got a piñata.

10:54.970 --> 10:56.679
- May I?
-  Have fun.

10:58.595 --> 11:00.845
That smile I've not seen
in too long.

11:02.887 --> 11:05.887
We did not know what gift
to bring for your Tom.

11:05.970 --> 11:07.595
I made a cake,
and I left it inside

11:07.679 --> 11:08.762
with the Mexican woman,

11:08.845 --> 11:11.178
but you have so much food
already.

11:11.261 --> 11:12.720
You didn't need
to bring anything.

11:12.804 --> 11:14.595
I left Frank's sleeping bag
inside as well.

11:14.679 --> 11:17.178
Ah, good.
Yeah, he'll have fun tonight.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.762
I won't let them stay up
too late.

11:18.845 --> 11:19.762
Don't worry.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.136
Where's the fun in that?

11:22.220 --> 11:25.470
I should perhaps meet
Mrs. Craft, ja?

11:25.553 --> 11:26.845
And who now is this?

11:28.512 --> 11:30.136
You keep her hidden,
Herr Peter.

11:30.220 --> 11:32.470
Uh, Mrs. Elsa Branson,

11:32.553 --> 11:34.887
may I present
Mr. Herman Ackermann.

11:34.970 --> 11:36.595
speaking German

11:36.679 --> 11:38.095
It is a pleasure,
Mr. Ackermann.

11:38.178 --> 11:39.345
Wait, wait, let me guess.

11:39.428 --> 11:41.303
The accent is Berlin, ja?

11:41.387 --> 11:42.637
But I can do better.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.637
We don't need
your party trick now.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.887
No, please, tell me who I am.

11:46.970 --> 11:49.553
Now I have it.
Kreuzberg.

11:49.637 --> 11:50.970
With the artists you lived, ja?

11:51.053 --> 11:53.261
Ja.
That's wunderbar.

11:53.345 --> 11:54.303
It's marvelous.

11:54.387 --> 11:55.845
You are a Berliner?

11:55.929 --> 11:57.720
Grunewald, born and bred.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.720
Now walk with me and tell me
everything about yourself.

11:59.804 --> 12:02.178
No.
Uh...

12:02.261 --> 12:04.970
She must meet
the other fellows.

12:05.053 --> 12:07.178
Uh, you will like them.

12:07.261 --> 12:11.595
We're, um, sort of
a...political club.

12:11.679 --> 12:13.095
Oh, I'm not much
for politics.

12:13.178 --> 12:15.512
That's okay; they also
drink beer and sing and...

12:24.470 --> 12:26.387

12:26.470 --> 12:29.011
Yes, typical
Bayerische,  huh?

12:29.095 --> 12:32.011

Dr. Craft's pretty backyard

12:32.095 --> 12:34.053
into a beer hall, gentlemen.

12:34.136 --> 12:35.470
Away from their wives.

12:35.553 --> 12:37.428
Ah, you're not married.

12:37.512 --> 12:38.929
Not for me the handcuffs, Elsa.

12:39.011 --> 12:40.220
I keep my wings free.

12:40.303 --> 12:42.595
Can I get you more beer?
Another stein, yeah?

12:42.679 --> 12:44.762
No, no, no.
Give us a song, girl.

12:44.845 --> 12:46.679
Yeah, you know
the beer house songs.

12:46.762 --> 12:48.136
We didn't learn
your filthy songs

12:48.220 --> 12:49.720
in Kreuzberg, sir.

12:49.804 --> 12:51.428
Oh, leave the poor girl alone,
now, huh?

12:51.512 --> 12:53.553
- She doesn't want to--
- Ja,  okay.

12:53.637 --> 12:55.428
You will help me
with the words.

12:55.512 --> 12:57.720
- It's been so long.
- Oh, I'll help you, I promise.

You were having an affair

- Oh, I see.

17:45.804 --> 17:48.637
I'm not who you want me to be.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.178
Well, I'll tell you, friend.

25:27.345 --> 25:30.136
All right, talk.

25:30.220 --> 25:33.637
You ever heard of a man
named Wernher von Braun?

25:35.261 --> 25:37.970
He's a rocket scientist
in Berlin--

25:38.053 --> 25:41.637
you know, payloads and apogees
and the such-like.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.595
So he's working
on a new rocket

25:43.679 --> 25:46.136
with a big engine
called the V-2,

25:46.220 --> 25:49.095
and everyone's racing
to catch up,

25:49.178 --> 25:53.637
including a bunch of kids
at Caltech over in Pasadena.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.553
So just for the sake
of argument,

25:56.637 --> 25:59.845
let's say these kids
beat the Krauts to it.

25:59.929 --> 26:03.512
They figure out how to make
this big new rocket fly.

26:03.595 --> 26:06.136
And say the Germans
steal that science

26:06.220 --> 26:08.011
and get it back to Berlin.

26:08.095 --> 26:09.512

and Jerusalem

26:14.512 --> 26:16.512

26:18.053 --> 26:21.136
That's why the Nazis
are in LA.

26:21.220 --> 26:23.720
I'm here because they killed
two of my friends,

26:23.804 --> 26:26.470

27:10.303 --> 27:12.595
