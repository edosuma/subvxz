who?

00:36.934 --> 00:38.268
andrew harris,

00:38.302 --> 00:39.936
A tenth grader.

00:39.970 --> 00:41.104
what's the big showcase?

00:41.138 --> 00:41.637
it's a performance

00:41.672 --> 00:42.405
They put on at her school

00:42.439 --> 00:43.305
Every year where...

00:43.340 --> 00:44.106
they invite agents

00:44.140 --> 00:45.541
And directors and producers

00:45.575 --> 00:46.756
And other super-powerful people

00:46.790 --> 00:47.523
In show business

00:47.558 --> 00:48.476
And it's extremely

00:48.511 --> 00:49.021
Important to me

00:49.055 --> 00:50.230
Which is why I am very upset

00:50.264 --> 00:53.502
And good bye.

00:53.536 --> 00:54.303
hey.

00:54.337 --> 00:55.340
He and I have a science project

00:55.374 --> 00:56.679
Due tomorrow.

00:56.713 --> 00:58.953
I have to turn in my mold bush.

00:58.987 --> 00:59.654
no.

00:59.688 --> 01:00.288
Andrew is coming over

01:00.322 --> 01:01.021
And you gotta help us

01:01.055 --> 01:01.853
Figure out what we're gonna do

01:01.888 --> 01:02.852
In the big showcase.

01:02.886 --> 01:05.550
I definitely wanna sing.

01:08.580 --> 01:09.344
How was that?

01:09.378 --> 01:10.176
loud?

01:10.210 --> 01:10.975
awesome.

01:11.841 --> 01:13.508
uch, he's here.

01:13.542 --> 01:18.541
Stay.

01:18.575 --> 01:19.939
Come in.

01:19.974 --> 01:22.772
thanks.

01:22.806 --> 01:24.939
tori, that's andrew.

01:24.973 --> 01:25.606
andre.

01:25.640 --> 01:26.371
hey.

01:26.406 --> 01:27.304
you go to hollywood arts,

01:27.338 --> 01:27.869
Too?

01:27.904 --> 01:28.337
oh, no.

01:28.371 --> 01:29.236
I'm not a performer.

01:29.271 --> 01:30.203
Just my sister.

01:30.237 --> 01:31.835
yep.

01:31.869 --> 01:32.335
I got the talent,

01:32.370 --> 01:34.968
And she got the strong teeth.

01:35.002 --> 01:35.834
You know, she's never had

01:35.869 --> 01:37.301
One cavity?

01:37.336 --> 01:39.935
I try not to brag about it.

01:39.969 --> 01:54.534
oh, nice piano.

01:54.535 --> 01:56.268
oh my god, you're fantastic.

01:56.302 --> 02:01.903
he's okay.

02:01.937 --> 02:03.337
fish mold.

02:09.471 --> 02:10.737
no, grandma, listen,

02:10.771 --> 02:11.871
There's no way you can drown

02:11.905 --> 02:14.038
At my school.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.600
You not gonna fall in a toilet.

02:17.773 --> 02:20.572
Look, I gotta... I gotta...

02:20.606 --> 02:23.206
I'll call you later.

02:23.240 --> 02:23.806
your grandmother's coming

02:23.841 --> 02:24.840
To the big showcase?

02:24.874 --> 02:25.274
yeah.

02:25.308 --> 02:25.840
It's gonna be the first time

02:25.875 --> 02:26.574
She's left the house

02:26.608 --> 02:28.108
In six years.

02:28.142 --> 02:28.708
why?

02:28.742 --> 02:29.308
'cause the woman's afraid

02:29.343 --> 02:30.675
Of everything: People,

02:30.710 --> 02:32.176
Umbrellas, rabbis, bikinis,

02:32.211 --> 02:33.443
Breakfast foods...

02:33.477 --> 02:34.444
so if she saw a rabbi

02:34.478 --> 02:36.011
In a bikini eating pancakes...

02:36.046 --> 02:36.678
the woman would burst

02:36.713 --> 02:39.846
Into flames.

02:39.881 --> 02:41.814
you guys, come on.

02:41.848 --> 02:42.647
back to rehearsal.

02:42.682 --> 02:45.615
let's go.

02:45.650 --> 02:48.851
so? What do you think?

02:48.885 --> 02:51.353
Fabulous, right?

02:51.387 --> 02:52.420
you really need to wear that,

02:52.454 --> 02:53.654
Just to rehearse?

02:53.688 --> 02:55.454
a performer needs to feel

02:55.488 --> 02:58.056
The part to be the part.

02:58.090 --> 02:58.856
I thought we talked about you

02:58.890 --> 03:01.791
Not tapping my nose anymore.

03:01.825 --> 03:02.724
okay, we got

03:02.759 --> 03:03.792
The comedy stuff down,

03:03.826 --> 03:05.192
So let's start with my song.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.059
and by "your song"

03:06.094 --> 03:06.826
I'm guessin' you mean

03:06.861 --> 03:08.027
That song I wrote?

03:08.061 --> 03:09.028
no one cares

03:09.062 --> 03:12.197
Who wrote the song.

03:12.231 --> 03:14.097
Now... Go!

03:42.432 --> 03:45.532
From "when I make it shine."

03:45.567 --> 03:53.537
âª when I make it shine âª

03:53.572 --> 03:54.838
well?

03:54.872 --> 03:57.074
do you have any aspirin?

04:23.756 --> 04:24.355
oh, hi.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.156
You're andre's grandmother?

04:25.190 --> 04:26.560
I don't know you.

04:45.068 --> 04:46.101
excuse me,

04:46.135 --> 04:47.035
You're trina's parents?

04:47.069 --> 04:48.235
yes.

04:48.269 --> 04:49.301
why?

04:49.335 --> 04:50.876
please come with me.

05:12.147 --> 05:13.314
there she is.

05:13.348 --> 05:14.348
trina.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.982
what happened?

05:18.751 --> 05:20.151
oh my god, it's huge.

05:23.887 --> 05:24.286
does anybody know

05:24.321 --> 05:26.354
How this happened?

05:26.389 --> 05:27.655
the chinese herb gargle.

05:28.557 --> 05:28.823
wait,

05:28.857 --> 05:29.590
What are you talking about?

05:29.624 --> 05:30.357
uh, she found some website

05:30.392 --> 05:30.958
That shows you

05:30.992 --> 05:32.059
How to make a special chinese

05:32.093 --> 05:32.859
Herb gargle that's supposed

05:32.894 --> 05:33.827
To help you sing better.

05:33.861 --> 05:34.360
well, she must have had

05:34.395 --> 05:35.995
An allergic reaction to it.

05:40.032 --> 05:41.099
will she be okay?

05:41.133 --> 05:41.833
well, her tongue

05:41.867 --> 05:43.901
Is obviously engorged and...

05:43.936 --> 05:46.404
Oh, it's throbbing erratically.

05:46.438 --> 05:47.772
throbbing erratically?

05:50.542 --> 05:51.675
any way she'll be able

05:51.710 --> 05:52.276
To perform today?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.210
of course not.

05:55.747 --> 05:56.747
stop talking.

05:56.781 --> 06:00.817
Your tongue could burst!

06:00.851 --> 06:02.352
I'm sorry, sweetie.

06:02.386 --> 06:03.353
next year.

06:03.387 --> 06:04.687
I'm gonna take her over there

06:04.722 --> 06:06.589
And massage her tongue.

06:06.624 --> 06:13.196
massage ma tong?

06:13.231 --> 06:14.130
guess my grandma came here

06:14.165 --> 06:15.899
For nothin'.

06:15.933 --> 06:16.499
wait.

06:16.534 --> 06:16.900
Does anyone else

06:16.934 --> 06:18.768
Know trina's part?

06:18.802 --> 06:20.270
her sister does.

06:20.304 --> 06:23.206
me sister? No, no, no, no.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.207
I just helped them rehearse.

06:24.242 --> 06:25.108
I'm not even a student here.

06:25.143 --> 06:25.709
I couldn't go onstage...

06:25.743 --> 06:26.676
you know this whole thing

06:26.711 --> 06:28.378
Inside and out...the song,

06:28.412 --> 06:29.279
The choreography...

06:29.313 --> 06:30.380
You can do this. Come on.

06:31.048 --> 06:32.015
she said she'll do it.

06:32.049 --> 06:33.516
no.

06:33.550 --> 06:34.550
No, I did not say I would do it.

06:34.585 --> 06:35.084
whoa, whoa.

06:35.119 --> 06:35.685
She cannot go on stage

06:35.719 --> 06:36.619
Wearing that.

06:36.654 --> 06:37.887
excuse me.

06:37.921 --> 06:38.354
go get her

06:38.388 --> 06:39.788
Something cool to wear.

06:39.822 --> 06:41.289
I am not going, okay?

06:41.324 --> 06:41.957
bring her.

06:41.991 --> 06:43.358
no. Wait.

06:43.392 --> 06:46.561
What are you doing? No. No.

06:46.595 --> 06:49.964
Let go of me.

06:50.899 --> 06:54.234
What, what,

06:54.268 --> 06:54.734
Where are you going?

06:54.769 --> 06:56.136
Like. Stop. Let go. Okay.

06:56.170 --> 06:57.036
It's okay. It's all right.

06:57.071 --> 06:57.871
Shut up and...

07:57.080 --> 07:57.780
let go of me.

07:57.814 --> 07:59.282
What are you doing?

07:59.316 --> 08:02.952
No, no, no, no.

08:02.986 --> 08:03.786
I said let go of me, please.

08:03.821 --> 08:13.991
No, no, please.

âª or what it will come to âª

08:45.049 --> 08:48.518
âª if only somebody could hear âª

08:48.552 --> 08:50.319
âª when you figure out how âª

08:50.354 --> 08:52.254

08:52.288 --> 09:03.031

10:55.717 --> 10:58.449

11:39.455 --> 11:40.588

If she's good enough

11:41.156 --> 11:42.557
To go to school here.

11:42.591 --> 11:51.730
What do you people think?

11:51.764 --> 11:53.765

12:34.720 --> 12:35.486
this is not just

12:35.521 --> 12:36.687
A high school.

12:36.722 --> 12:37.555
These kids are all artsy

12:37.589 --> 12:39.022
And creative and talented,

12:39.057 --> 12:41.192
And I'm just normal.

12:41.226 --> 12:42.793
it's okay,

12:42.827 --> 12:43.493
There's nothing wrong

12:43.528 --> 12:47.296
With being average.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.197
Anyway, you're not alone.

12:49.232 --> 12:50.331
I got your back.

12:50.366 --> 12:51.065

oh my god,

13:03.876 --> 13:04.843
You're tori, right?

13:05.544 --> 13:06.277
you were so awesome

13:06.312 --> 13:07.478
In the big showcase.

13:07.512 --> 13:08.412
aw, thanks.

13:08.447 --> 13:09.579
my name's cat.

13:09.614 --> 13:10.113
like the animal?

13:10.148 --> 13:12.681
what's that supposed to mean?

13:13.916 --> 13:15.649
nothing, I love cats.

13:15.684 --> 13:18.253
me too, they're so cute.

13:21.287 --> 13:22.020
hey, um...

13:22.055 --> 13:24.756
oh, hi. Hey. Hello.

13:24.791 --> 13:25.457
female?

13:25.491 --> 13:28.225
yes.

13:28.259 --> 13:28.892
can you tell me where

13:28.926 --> 13:31.027
Mr. Sikowitz' classroom is?

13:40.961 --> 13:41.927
down the hall, swing a left

13:41.961 --> 13:43.061
At the water fountain,

13:43.096 --> 13:45.796
Second door on your right.

13:45.830 --> 13:49.399
thank you.

13:49.433 --> 13:52.073
whatever it takes, cupcake.

14:18.685 --> 14:19.952
oh, hey.

14:19.987 --> 14:21.320
oh my gosh.

14:21.355 --> 14:22.487
ah, it's cool...

14:22.522 --> 14:24.855
no, here...

14:24.889 --> 14:26.255
I think it's coming out.

14:28.690 --> 14:29.223
...you might be making

14:29.257 --> 14:32.193
It worse, actually.

14:33.727 --> 14:35.595
dude, why you rubbing

14:35.629 --> 14:37.930
My boyfriend?

14:38.765 --> 14:39.197
I just...

14:39.232 --> 14:40.298
I spilled coffee on...

14:40.333 --> 14:42.233
get away from him.

14:42.268 --> 14:45.336
relax.

14:45.371 --> 14:46.103
oh my god,

14:46.138 --> 14:49.173
There's a huge fire!

14:49.708 --> 14:52.143
Kidding, kidding.

14:52.177 --> 14:52.777
Just wanted to get

14:52.811 --> 14:54.212
Your blood pumping,

14:54.246 --> 14:57.215
Which I did. Ha!

14:57.249 --> 14:58.349
All right!

14:58.383 --> 15:00.283
Now, let's get started...

15:00.318 --> 15:03.019
Rumps in chairs.

15:03.053 --> 15:04.087
he's our teacher?

15:04.121 --> 15:05.254
okay, first,

15:05.288 --> 15:05.988
I'd like to introduce

15:06.022 --> 15:08.356
Our new student, tori.

15:08.391 --> 15:09.457
And I'd like to thank tori

15:09.492 --> 15:10.992
For her generous gift of $2

15:11.026 --> 15:11.459
Which she handed me

15:11.493 --> 15:12.360
Outside this morning.

15:12.395 --> 15:13.595
Not necessary,

15:13.630 --> 15:16.232
But much appreciated.

15:16.266 --> 15:17.467
why'd you give him $2?

15:17.501 --> 15:20.036
I thought he was homeless.

15:20.070 --> 15:21.237
now today we're going

15:21.271 --> 15:22.337
To continue our study

15:22.372 --> 15:23.605
In group improv.

15:23.639 --> 15:24.306
Tori, I assume

15:24.340 --> 15:25.440
You're familiar with improv?

15:28.674 --> 15:29.140
no.

15:29.174 --> 15:31.442
okay, crash course.

15:31.976 --> 15:35.878
Improv, acting without a script,

15:35.912 --> 15:37.012
Which means the actors

15:37.047 --> 15:37.479
Must make up

15:37.513 --> 15:39.914
Their own actions and dialogue

15:39.949 --> 15:41.182
As they perform the scene.

15:41.217 --> 15:42.184
Understood?

15:42.218 --> 15:42.851
Excellent.

15:42.885 --> 15:43.752
Jade, you will captain

15:43.786 --> 15:44.753
The first group of the day.

15:44.788 --> 15:47.556
Choose your actors.

15:47.591 --> 15:55.331
cat, eli, beck, and tori.

15:55.365 --> 15:57.566
okay, let's give 'em a place.

15:57.601 --> 15:58.200
home.

15:58.234 --> 15:59.501
home.

15:59.536 --> 16:00.669
oh, real creative.

16:00.704 --> 16:02.538
you be quiet.

16:04.106 --> 16:06.508
and now we need a situation.

16:06.542 --> 16:07.609
big news.

16:07.643 --> 16:08.543
andre, nobody wants to see

16:08.577 --> 16:10.846
Big nudes.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.781
news.

16:11.815 --> 16:13.449
ah, well that's different.

16:13.484 --> 16:15.551
Big news.

16:15.585 --> 16:16.519
ah, why don't you go wait

16:16.553 --> 16:17.753
In the hall?

16:17.787 --> 16:20.755
uh, okay.

16:20.790 --> 16:21.456
okay.

16:21.490 --> 16:24.425
At home, big news...

16:24.460 --> 16:25.660
And action.

16:25.695 --> 16:26.394
hey, babe,

16:26.429 --> 16:27.662
How was work today?

16:27.697 --> 16:29.097
ah, I got fired.

16:30.132 --> 16:31.366
again?

16:34.200 --> 16:35.334
it's okay.

16:35.368 --> 16:36.902
I have great news

16:36.936 --> 16:37.402
That'll cheer up

16:37.437 --> 16:38.537
This whole family.

16:38.571 --> 16:39.905
what is it? Tell us!

16:39.940 --> 16:42.475
I went to the animal shelter

16:42.509 --> 16:47.846
And got us... A dog.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.613
uh, yep.

16:49.648 --> 16:51.814
I'm the new family dog.

16:51.849 --> 16:54.484
Woof.

16:54.518 --> 16:56.385
sikowitz, will you please

16:56.420 --> 16:57.253
Tell this amateur

16:57.287 --> 16:58.855
That dogs can't talk,

16:58.889 --> 16:59.555
And that they don't walk

16:59.590 --> 17:01.291
On two legs?

17:01.325 --> 17:03.059
Sikowitz!!

17:03.093 --> 17:03.926
oh, I'm sorry,

17:03.961 --> 17:04.460
I was sucking the milk

17:04.494 --> 17:07.430
Out of this coconut.

17:07.464 --> 17:08.830
But it's true, tori,

17:08.866 --> 17:10.700
If you're going to play a dog,

17:10.733 --> 17:16.372
Be a dog.

17:16.406 --> 17:17.039
woof.

17:17.073 --> 17:18.440
and action.

17:18.474 --> 17:19.241
uh, I went

17:19.276 --> 17:20.443
To the animal shelter

17:20.477 --> 17:22.278
And got us a dog.

17:22.746 --> 17:24.280
awesome.

17:29.414 --> 17:31.348
uh-oh, looks like this dog

17:31.383 --> 17:33.651
Has bugs in her fur.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.920
uhhh, woof?

17:36.888 --> 17:37.588
gross.

17:37.622 --> 17:38.756
aw, it's okay.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.190
I read on the internet

17:40.225 --> 17:41.725
That coffee works great

17:41.760 --> 17:44.228
For getting rid of fur bugs.

17:44.262 --> 17:45.062
maybe you shouldn't,

17:45.697 --> 17:56.774
jade.

17:56.809 --> 18:12.622
what's the prob, dog?

18:19.727 --> 18:21.160
hey, whatcha doin'?

18:21.195 --> 18:21.694
calling my mom

18:21.728 --> 18:22.428
To tell her I wanna go back

18:22.462 --> 18:23.729
To my old school.

18:23.763 --> 18:24.329
why?

18:24.364 --> 18:24.796
'cause I don't like

18:24.830 --> 18:26.230
Having black coffee in my hair.

18:26.265 --> 18:26.731
then I'll get you

18:26.765 --> 18:28.032
Some cream and sugar.

18:28.067 --> 18:29.701
Everything will be chill.

18:29.735 --> 18:30.668
hey, mom, I need you to...

18:30.703 --> 18:32.003
uh-um. No.

18:32.037 --> 18:33.705
gimme back my mom!

18:33.739 --> 18:34.439
you're gonna quit this school

18:34.473 --> 18:35.406
On your first day,

18:35.440 --> 18:36.674
Just because of one mean girl?

18:36.708 --> 18:37.808
it's not just her!

18:37.842 --> 18:39.276
It's just... I don't fit in here

18:39.310 --> 18:41.579
With... all this.

18:41.614 --> 18:42.180
c'mon, this place

18:42.214 --> 18:43.114
Isn't that different

18:43.148 --> 18:44.382
From other schools.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.983
oh yeah, like regular schools

18:46.018 --> 18:46.617
Have improv classes

18:46.652 --> 18:47.485
With barefoot teachers

18:47.519 --> 18:48.319
And nerds with puppets

18:48.353 --> 18:49.687
And bipolar cats and mean girls

18:49.721 --> 18:52.155
Who make you bark like a dog?

18:52.190 --> 18:53.390
uh, you guys...

18:53.424 --> 18:53.924
sikowitz wants you both

18:53.958 --> 18:55.359
Back in class.

18:55.393 --> 18:57.427
he asked me to tell them!

18:57.462 --> 18:58.428
see, this doesn't happen

18:58.462 --> 19:00.430
At my old school.

19:00.464 --> 19:01.231
will you guys be cool?

19:01.265 --> 19:05.902
him? Be cool?

19:05.936 --> 19:08.504
you're a demon!

19:08.539 --> 19:09.572
you guys,

19:09.606 --> 19:10.606
Sikowitz really wants everybody

19:10.641 --> 19:12.142
Back in class.

19:12.176 --> 19:13.343
and you really wanted a date

19:13.377 --> 19:14.477
To the prom last year,

19:14.511 --> 19:18.214
But you didn't get one, did ya?

19:19.748 --> 19:20.715
rex.

19:20.749 --> 19:21.316
tell your puppet

19:21.350 --> 19:22.817
To quit being mean to me!

19:22.851 --> 19:24.552
don't call him a puppet!

19:24.586 --> 19:26.754
That's an offensive term!

19:26.788 --> 19:27.421
yeah, this school's

19:27.456 --> 19:29.424
Pretty normal.

19:29.458 --> 19:30.691
just please go back to class

19:30.726 --> 19:31.459
And tell sikowitz

19:31.493 --> 19:32.526
We'll be there in a minute?

19:32.561 --> 19:33.594
you better hurry.

19:33.628 --> 19:34.729
yeah.

19:34.763 --> 19:35.930
I was gonna say yeah!

19:35.964 --> 19:36.697
just keep it to yourself,

19:36.732 --> 19:38.399
I don't want to hear it.

19:43.133 --> 19:43.666
okay.

19:43.701 --> 19:45.468
This school's not normal.

19:45.502 --> 19:47.336
really?

19:47.371 --> 19:50.239
you're not normal either.

19:50.274 --> 19:50.907
I've seen what you can do

19:50.941 --> 19:52.641
On stage.

19:52.676 --> 19:54.110
You're special.

19:54.144 --> 19:56.445
You're fantastic.

19:56.480 --> 20:03.519
You belong at this school.

20:03.553 --> 20:10.559
Normal's boring.

20:10.593 --> 20:12.060
it's true.

20:12.094 --> 20:13.061
that normal's boring?

20:13.095 --> 20:14.396
no, that no one asked me

20:14.430 --> 20:15.968
To the prom.

20:44.157 --> 20:45.057
you know,

20:45.092 --> 20:47.664
You're actually not terrible.

20:51.698 --> 20:52.331
You're really gonna quit

20:52.365 --> 20:53.999
Hollywood arts?

20:54.034 --> 20:54.600
what do you think

20:54.634 --> 20:55.668
I should do?

20:55.702 --> 20:57.503
I think you should come back.

20:57.537 --> 20:58.270
why?

20:58.304 --> 20:59.471
so I won't be known at school

20:59.506 --> 21:00.139
As the girl

21:00.173 --> 21:01.106
With the lame little sister

21:01.141 --> 21:08.480
Who quit on her first day.

21:08.514 --> 21:09.214
and I think

21:09.248 --> 21:10.349
You were really good in

21:10.383 --> 21:12.951
The big showcase.

21:12.985 --> 21:13.652
thanks, treen.

21:13.686 --> 21:19.257
but I woulda been amazing.

21:59.573 --> 22:01.941
tori. You're back.

22:01.975 --> 22:02.508
Have you ever thought

22:02.543 --> 22:03.009
About coming in

22:03.043 --> 22:04.944
Through the window?

22:04.978 --> 22:05.678
no.

22:05.712 --> 22:07.246
think about it.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.482
Now, sit, sit.

22:09.516 --> 22:10.249
Okay, today,

22:10.283 --> 22:10.816
We're going to do

22:10.851 --> 22:12.118
Some alphabetical improv.

22:12.152 --> 22:13.586
"what is alphabetical improv,"

22:13.620 --> 22:14.620
You ask?

22:14.654 --> 22:15.287
So I answer.

22:15.321 --> 22:16.955
It's when we give a letter

22:16.990 --> 22:17.622
To the first actor

22:17.657 --> 22:18.490
Who speaks in the scene.

22:18.524 --> 22:20.225
If we used the letter "a"

22:20.260 --> 22:20.759
As an example,

22:20.793 --> 22:21.260
Then the actor must make

22:21.294 --> 22:21.927
His first word

22:21.961 --> 22:23.495
Start with the letter "a"

22:23.529 --> 22:25.731
Which might go something like...

22:25.765 --> 22:26.498
apples are falling out

22:26.532 --> 22:29.001
Of my butt.

22:29.035 --> 22:29.568
lovely.

22:29.602 --> 22:30.769
Now the next actor who speaks

22:30.803 --> 22:31.736
Must start his line

22:31.771 --> 22:32.804
With the next letter

22:32.839 --> 22:33.572
In the alphabet,

22:33.606 --> 22:34.606
In this case, b,

22:34.640 --> 22:36.775
So he might say...

22:36.809 --> 22:37.609
bring those apples,

22:37.643 --> 22:38.610
So that we may all enjoy

22:38.644 --> 22:39.311
The fresh fruit

22:39.345 --> 22:42.347
From beck's butt.

22:42.381 --> 22:42.947
charming.

22:42.982 --> 22:43.681
Now who wants to lead

22:43.715 --> 22:44.649
The first group?

22:44.683 --> 22:45.516
I do.

22:45.550 --> 22:46.851
All right, tori.

22:46.885 --> 22:49.487
Choose your actors.

22:49.521 --> 22:50.355
okay.

22:50.389 --> 22:54.859
Andre, cat, beck and jade.

22:54.894 --> 22:56.868
Yeah, you.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.570
jade, kiss your boyfriend

23:04.605 --> 23:06.272
On your own time.

23:06.307 --> 23:09.106
oh, I will.

23:09.141 --> 23:10.174
okay, if you start your line

23:10.208 --> 23:11.275
With the wrong letter...

23:12.043 --> 23:13.209
...You're out.

23:13.244 --> 23:14.310
Robbie, give us a letter.

23:14.345 --> 23:15.044
p.

23:15.079 --> 23:16.012
p.

23:16.046 --> 23:19.514
awww, I was going to say p.

23:19.549 --> 23:20.382
okay, the scene can be

23:20.416 --> 23:21.483
About anything you want.

23:21.517 --> 23:22.116
The first letter

23:22.151 --> 23:23.785
Of the first line is p.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.720
Tori, action.

23:25.754 --> 23:27.388
please go take a shower.

23:27.422 --> 23:29.122
quit telling me what to do.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.590
relax girls,

23:30.625 --> 23:31.591
Let's all try to get along.

23:31.625 --> 23:32.225
totally.

23:33.060 --> 23:33.826
cat, your line

23:33.861 --> 23:35.294
Had to start with an s.

23:36.428 --> 23:38.095
aw, my life's the worst!

23:38.330 --> 23:39.096
here's a piece of candy.

23:39.130 --> 23:42.465
yay, I love candy!

23:42.500 --> 23:43.299
all right, andre,

23:43.334 --> 23:44.634
Letter s to you.

23:44.668 --> 23:45.568
uh, somethin'

23:45.602 --> 23:46.869
Just bit my toe.

23:46.903 --> 23:47.703
turtle.

23:47.737 --> 23:49.037
That turtle just bit his toe.

23:49.072 --> 23:49.805
unbelievable

23:49.839 --> 23:50.739
That you're even here.

23:50.773 --> 23:51.739
very immature of you

23:51.774 --> 23:52.840
To say that.

23:53.642 --> 23:54.775
c'mon andre, w.

23:54.810 --> 23:55.810
what if the turtle bite

23:55.844 --> 23:57.545
Broke my toe-bone?

23:57.579 --> 23:58.579
x-rays are the only way

23:58.613 --> 23:59.446
To find out.

23:59.480 --> 24:00.613
you should shut up.

24:00.648 --> 24:01.414
zap!

24:01.448 --> 24:02.115
I just healed your toe

24:02.149 --> 24:03.482
With my magic finger.

24:03.517 --> 24:04.016
thanks!

24:05.051 --> 24:05.884
Andre, your line had to start

24:05.919 --> 24:06.985
With an "a."

24:07.019 --> 24:08.386
Sit down.

24:08.421 --> 24:09.053
aw, and I just got

24:09.088 --> 24:11.522
My toe-bone fixed.

24:11.557 --> 24:13.791
tori, letter "a" to you.

24:13.825 --> 24:14.925
aliens are the only people

24:14.960 --> 24:15.693
Who can heal toes

24:15.727 --> 24:16.894
By finger-zapping.

24:16.928 --> 24:17.928
by the way...

24:19.397 --> 24:21.664
correct, I am an alien.

24:21.698 --> 24:24.200
oh, a twist.

24:24.234 --> 24:25.367
don't hurt me, please.

24:25.402 --> 24:26.168
even though

24:26.202 --> 24:29.137
She's extremely annoying.

24:29.172 --> 24:30.105
fainting,

24:30.139 --> 24:31.540
Because I can't breathe

24:31.574 --> 24:34.443
Your earth's air.

24:34.477 --> 24:35.544
gosh, it fainted!

24:35.578 --> 24:36.278
excellent!

24:36.312 --> 24:37.346
Tori and jade, keep going!

24:37.380 --> 24:38.447
The next letter's h!

24:38.481 --> 24:39.448
hey, why don't you go

24:39.482 --> 24:41.350
Jump off that cliff over there?

24:41.384 --> 24:42.484
I think you should.

24:42.518 --> 24:44.186
just where did you come from?

24:44.220 --> 24:44.820
kangaroos.

24:44.854 --> 24:46.054
lousy animals,

24:46.089 --> 24:47.022
Kangaroos.

24:47.056 --> 24:49.725
They're awkward and dirty.

24:49.759 --> 24:51.794
maybe they learned from you.

24:51.828 --> 24:54.997
ooh.

24:55.032 --> 24:57.199
no one talks to me like that.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.601
obviously someone should.

24:58.635 --> 25:01.204
please run in front of a bus.

25:01.238 --> 25:01.871
quite obnoxious of you

25:01.905 --> 25:02.305
To say.

25:02.339 --> 25:03.206
really?

25:03.240 --> 25:03.873
sure was.

25:03.907 --> 25:05.942
thanks.

25:05.976 --> 25:07.243
up your nose, I see boogers.

25:07.278 --> 25:08.144
very clever.

25:08.179 --> 25:09.112
wish you'd thought of it?

25:09.146 --> 25:09.880
x marks the spot

25:09.914 --> 25:10.947
I'd like to punch.

25:10.982 --> 25:13.917
your finger smells weird.

25:13.951 --> 25:15.018
zero is what you are

25:15.053 --> 25:16.287
On a scale from 1 to 10.

25:16.321 --> 25:18.255
and back to the letter "a."

25:18.290 --> 25:19.423
as if I care what you think.

25:19.458 --> 25:20.458
better watch yourself.

25:20.492 --> 25:21.325
can't take it?

25:21.360 --> 25:22.193
don't push me.

25:22.227 --> 25:22.960
eat your pants!

25:22.995 --> 25:24.595
you eat your pants! Wait!

25:25.631 --> 25:26.498
sorry jade,

25:26.532 --> 25:28.166
The next letter was...

25:28.201 --> 25:33.698
f! I know!

25:35.833 --> 25:36.998
keep the scene going.

25:37.033 --> 25:37.666
Letter g!

25:37.700 --> 25:39.300
get up, alien.

25:39.335 --> 25:42.703
head... feels dizzy.

25:42.737 --> 25:43.237
I know what'll make you

25:43.271 --> 25:45.405
Feel better.

25:45.440 --> 25:49.042
jumping jacks?

25:49.076 --> 25:51.143
kiss me.

25:51.178 --> 25:53.721
little weird, let's do it.

26:04.222 --> 26:06.703
man, I love this school.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
