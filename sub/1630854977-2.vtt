00:49.440 --> 00:50.800
Hello?

00:51.320 --> 00:53.200
Where is everyone?

00:53.800 --> 00:55.240
Hello?

00:55.920 --> 00:57.720
Hey, tea bag.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.040
Welcome to the worst hangover
of your life, baby girl.

01:21.840 --> 01:22.760
Sandy, please.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.000
You've been nonstop for hours now.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.560
Look who I found.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.840
First to pass out at the sleepover,
as per usual.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.440
What the hell are you all doing?

01:42.600 --> 01:45.720
I just saw a real life seal
in the netball courts.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.280
Oh, that's Seal, the seal.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.360
- Huh?
- Like the singer.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.760
I need to call my husband.
I need to go back home to Brisbane.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.680
Oh, my God,
this is happening in Brisbane, too.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.440
Why are you all not panicking?

01:55.440 --> 01:57.800
We panicked at 4:00 a.m.
You just missed it.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.920
We're sorry, okay?

01:58.920 --> 02:00.960
We'll never leave you
out of the panicking ever again.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.280
- Okay.
- All right? Okay.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.800
Nobody really knows
what's happening right now.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.960
The power's out
and there's no phone signal.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.480
So why don't you grab a pancake,
take a deep breath

02:10.480 --> 02:12.560
and come and sit down
and we'll make a plan, yeah?

02:12.560 --> 02:15.400
Well, some of us knew what was happening.

02:18.520 --> 02:23.400
There was a small miscommunication.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.960
There are no pancakes left.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.720
I don't know how any of you
can eat at a time like this.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.800
Oh, um, well, Teresa,
why don't you and Zoe

02:39.800 --> 02:42.360
share some of Sandy's pancake
since she's not eating it?

02:42.360 --> 02:43.600
No!

02:43.720 --> 02:45.960
Teresa, it is bad enough
you stole my Oakleys in grade 12.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.400
Now you want my pancake, too, huh?

02:47.400 --> 02:49.560
What kind of best friend
would do that, Teresa?

02:50.000 --> 02:53.400
Sorry, Sandy, but since when
were we best friends?

02:54.160 --> 02:55.520
Saskia was my best friend.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.080
No, Zoe was Saskia's best friend.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.520
No, Amelia was Zoe's best friend.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.680
No, it was Amelia,
and then she ditched her for Saskia.

03:03.680 --> 03:06.040
And we were best friends, Teresa.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.280
Whatever, please,
just give me this pancake.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.240
You want it? Oh, you...

03:10.240 --> 03:11.840
Go get it!

03:14.840 --> 03:17.920
Right, ladies, what's our plan?

03:18.400 --> 03:20.640
Because as former school captain...

03:20.640 --> 03:22.960
-  Caretaker.
- Yes, okay, whatever.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.040
I'm happy to lead this emergency response.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.000
Yeah, Sas?

03:28.400 --> 03:29.520
What's the plan?

03:31.120 --> 03:32.200
Hmm?

03:33.360 --> 03:35.360
Oh, um...

03:35.360 --> 03:38.200
I don't think we need to,
you know, nominate a leader or anything.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.760
We just chip in, share.

03:42.200 --> 03:46.520
Um, but it might be helpful
to just have one person across...

03:46.520 --> 03:48.240
I will search for a signal.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.640
And maybe the old rowing team can
take a boat and see what's out there.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.320
- Yeah.
- So, me and you.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.240
Amelia, right?

03:56.760 --> 04:00.280
And I will look for some first aid kits
and, oh, some second aid kits.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.920
Yeah, and, um, I am gonna...

04:01.920 --> 04:03.680
Find another bird to shit in your mouth?

04:03.680 --> 04:05.640
Trip and fall into a sinkhole?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.400
Or just fuck off and die.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.640
Zoe, you can wash up

04:11.640 --> 04:14.520
as penance.
And I'll do a stockpile of the food.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.640
But in the meantime,
nobody eat anything or use any water.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.680
We don't know how long we'll be here for.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.640
An honour code.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.880
A sisterly agreement
that no one eats until we all eat.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.600
- Okay? Great.

04:29.040 --> 04:35.000
And what better way to lift our spirits
than with a little school spirit?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.200
Oh, no, don't.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.080
<i>♪ Ridge Heights ladies staying calm ♪</i>

04:39.080 --> 04:42.600
<i>♪ We make such a better crowd ♪</i>

04:43.000 --> 04:44.240
<i>♪ Better... ♪</i>

04:47.520 --> 04:49.440
- Mels, can I talk to you for a sec?

04:49.440 --> 04:50.560
Nah, I'm good.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.160
Sorry to disappoint you.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.520
Good, girls, good.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.320
Stay focused. Eyes forward.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.080
In time.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.360
Come on, girls.
In time, come on.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.320
Okay. Stop rowing. Stop!

06:09.720 --> 06:12.600
Do you want to be on a state championship
winning team, Amelia?

06:13.320 --> 06:15.360
Come on, I asked you a question,
you redneck.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.600
Do you want to be on this team or not?

06:18.560 --> 06:19.640
Not really, no.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.960
Then get out of my boat.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.560
You heard me. Get out of the boat.

06:25.320 --> 06:29.000
Go! Get out of the fucking boat, Amelia.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.400
Maybe pick up the pace a little, Collins.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.640
Maybe go fuck yourself, Saskia.

06:35.640 --> 06:36.640
What?

06:37.200 --> 06:38.880
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Easy.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.160
Amelia, what are you doing?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.160
Stop! Amelia.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.360
Okay, ladies, let's find my bag!

06:48.840 --> 06:50.440
It has to be here somewhere.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.120
Nobody rests until it is found.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.680
Oi, Sandy, is this it?

06:55.680 --> 06:56.920
Are you kidding me?

06:57.280 --> 06:59.280
I can smell that pleather knock-off
from here.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.800
Offence taken, Forgettable Laura.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.320
Where did you get those?

07:02.320 --> 07:04.120
Aren't we meant to be waiting
to eat together?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.680
Yes, we are.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.800
I didn't get a pancake this morning,
and I somehow still haven't found my bag.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.000
It's a D'Amiré, Pepé.
A limited edition D'Amiré.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.040
It is a total waste of womanpower
to look for a bag, Sandy.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.160
We need candles and torches.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.520
Something we can trap the ibises with
if we get really desperate for food.

07:23.520 --> 07:24.760
Hey!

07:25.400 --> 07:26.880
I was mid wish chip.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.560
This is life and death, Sandy.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.000
- What don't you understand about it?
-  Is it?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.080
Well, maybe we can
make it life and death, Pepé.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.680
- Come on!
-  Get away from me!

07:42.920 --> 07:45.240
Wait. Is everyone doing something?

07:45.720 --> 07:48.720
Maybe we just need to look like
we're doing something to

07:48.720 --> 07:50.520
honor the sisterly agreement.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.200
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.240
Yeah.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.840
- No.
- We're going to need a clipboard.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.200
-  Mmm.
-  Yes.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.120
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.240
Fuck this.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.760
Oh, God, what am I doing?

09:39.760 --> 09:42.880
Amelia, uh, how can I, uh...
How can I help you?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.600
- Oh!

09:44.600 --> 09:47.320
They're working, yes.
They're definitely working.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.720
I forgot I left them on to check.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.080
Anyway, what's up?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.720
You talk now, please.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.240
Do you think you could get me
some Prolexoft?

09:56.320 --> 10:00.400
Uh, Prolexoft. That... Yes. um...

10:00.760 --> 10:02.640
Oh, yeah, of course. Prolexoft.

10:02.760 --> 10:03.840
Great.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.160
Figure in a school of 800 girls,

10:06.160 --> 10:08.760
it can't be that hard to track down
some anti-depressants, right?

10:08.760 --> 10:10.640
Yeah.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.360
Bitches be crazy.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.320
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I didn't...

10:18.120 --> 10:19.240
Are you okay?

10:20.720 --> 10:21.760
Yeah.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.200
I am now.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.240
- Wait, did something happen?
- Oh.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.840
- We hear something about a rescue?
- No, no. It's just, um...

10:29.840 --> 10:32.240
- We are safest up here.
- Yeah.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.240
Um...

10:35.640 --> 10:38.160
Can we keep the Prolexoft thing
between us?

10:38.160 --> 10:41.080
Yeah. Doctor-patient congeniality.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.880
- Yeah, it's...
- Yeah.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.640
Prolexoft, got it.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.400
Did you throw a brick
through the radio club window?

11:08.760 --> 11:09.680
Maybe.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.160
Why are you all wet?
What's with the toothbrush?

11:13.880 --> 11:16.200
Can you make the radio work?
Do you still know how to use it?

11:16.200 --> 11:18.200
Yeah, but not without power.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.440
Good. Let's go get some.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.880
Bit busy getting us saved here, actually.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.360
Scorching a big-ass "help" sign
into the grass.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.320
Any minute now, the letters
are going to show up,

11:30.320 --> 11:32.680
and then the Westpac rescue chopper
is going to see that shit.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.680
And, bam, we will be out of here.
You're welcome.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.040
No, they won't.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.320
And why is that, smarty pants?

11:38.320 --> 11:40.400
Because that's not herbicide.

11:40.720 --> 11:41.640
That's petrol.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.040
Strike two, Zoe.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.280
Wait! What was strike one?

11:51.400 --> 11:52.360
Yep.

11:52.920 --> 11:53.840
Got it.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.600
Oi, wait up.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.360
Fuck!

12:09.400 --> 12:10.960
You all right, Mels?
I'm on a deadline here.

12:10.960 --> 12:14.480
Oh! She's on a deadline.
You're on a deadline?

12:14.480 --> 12:16.880
- Yes.
- This is life and death shit, Phoebe.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.240
Okay? We are going to be here
for a long time,

12:19.240 --> 12:22.160
and this fucking deadline
is the difference

12:22.160 --> 12:24.480
between whether or not we eat in a month.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.880
Do you have any idea
how unstable the market is right now?

12:26.880 --> 12:27.800
There is no market.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.000
There's no trading floor,
there's no ones, there's no zeros.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.200
We are stranded indefinitely.

12:33.160 --> 12:38.720
The currency is now, is now food
and water and batteries and tampons.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.160
Do you understand what I'm saying?

12:41.160 --> 12:43.760
You're being very melodramatic, okay?

12:44.440 --> 12:47.640
And you are going to feel like
a bit of a fuckwit

12:47.640 --> 12:49.480
when we get out of here tomorrow.

12:49.480 --> 12:53.000
Now excuse me while I find a signal.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.040
Fucking deadlines and handbags.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.480
- Zoe, just stop.
- Sorry.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.240
I've been meaning to say, um,
I like your hair like that.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.600
Just trying to make conversation.

13:19.600 --> 13:22.520
Yeah, because when it matters,
we don't hear a peep out of you,

13:22.520 --> 13:25.600
but by the time you do,
you're all in.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.240
You know he's gonna be okay, right?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.280
You don't get to talk about Danny, okay?

13:32.280 --> 13:34.760
Or my sad little peanut farm
or any of the other

13:34.920 --> 13:38.320
unremarkable things about me that don't
live up to your expectations, okay?

13:38.800 --> 13:40.280
You've no idea about my life.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.480
I may have added a few little
attention grabbing flourishes.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.320
You drew a dick and balls, didn't you?

13:53.560 --> 13:55.160
Dick and balls, so reductive.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.960
Feminist flourishes.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.360
Feminism won't power
the generator, Zoe.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.440
Lift with your knees.

14:12.880 --> 14:13.800
No.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.680
It's too professional. No.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.560
Clipboard like that
invites too many questions.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.640
Yeah, you're right.
This bitch is too competent.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.080
Like she's into mentoring.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.440
She wants to know
where you see yourself in five years.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.320
We don't want to see her at all.

14:26.720 --> 14:27.640
Bye, bitch.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.640
Oh! Slay, yes.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.640
Black. Simple.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.600
It says, "I'm in business,

14:39.720 --> 14:42.680
but not enough for you to ask me
any detailed questions about it."

14:50.720 --> 14:52.640
Bitch, come here.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.440
We're gonna be okay, Tegan.
We're gonna be okay.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.880
All right.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.280
- Oh, we got a signal.
- Can we see any other signals?

15:08.280 --> 15:11.000
No, it's too rudimentary for that, but

15:11.000 --> 15:13.200
no harm in putting out a little call.

15:16.640 --> 15:20.480
You're listening to Zo-Zo FM
where the secret word of the day is Pocko.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.920
For all of our international listeners,

15:21.920 --> 15:25.720
that's what this Aussie broadcaster
is nicknaming the apocalypse.

15:25.720 --> 15:30.080
Call in with your funniest stories
of surviving the Pocko on 9-7...

15:30.680 --> 15:32.520
No, but seriously, mayd...

15:32.520 --> 15:34.120
- ...ay.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.440
- Strike three?
- Yeah.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.480
Yep.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.200
Please, please, Sandy, stop.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.560
Sandy, stop eating.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.240
Our survival depends on it.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.320
Fuck survival, Pepé.
We're better off dying.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.280
You want to rot away in here fighting over
pancake crumbs? Give me that mini pizza.

16:06.280 --> 16:10.000
Sandy, no, if not for us,
at least think of the gluten.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.720
I fucking hate lamingtons!

16:15.320 --> 16:17.840
Tacky Australian cakes!

16:17.840 --> 16:19.240
Sandy, no!

16:19.240 --> 16:21.720
Oh, you wanna go too, peanut farmer?
Well, come at me!

16:22.320 --> 16:25.760
- And don't get me started on Vegemite.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.720
I mean, what the fucking fuck,
you fucking sickos?

16:29.720 --> 16:30.680
Drop it!

16:31.680 --> 16:32.600
Drop it.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.800
No!

16:37.160 --> 16:39.000
How dare you?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.360
That was our only source of Vitamin B!

16:41.360 --> 16:43.520
- It's a jar of salt, Pepé.
- Don't.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.600
See, Amelia?
This is why we need a leader.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.080
It's chaos without one. Don't touch me.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.640
- Hey.
-  Sorry. Sorry.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.560
I know it's stupid,
but I just can't stop thinking

17:01.560 --> 17:03.800
about my next IVF appointment
in two weeks.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.200
Aw, I don't think that's stupid, T.
I think it's perfectly natural.

17:09.320 --> 17:13.080
I know it looks bad,
but we don't know what we don't know.

17:13.320 --> 17:14.480
We just have to stay positive.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.080
Yeah, but, Sas, we are so high up,
and it is everywhere.

17:17.080 --> 17:18.560
What if everything is...

17:18.560 --> 17:20.280
Yeah. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.320
It's okay.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.720
Do you know what I learned
from creating a startup?

17:26.520 --> 17:27.440
How to fail.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.000
There was a period about three years ago,

17:34.160 --> 17:35.560
bank accounts were empty,

17:36.160 --> 17:37.880
investors weren't calling us back.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.720
So we sat down our staff
and gave them an option.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.680
Either ride it out
or go find another job.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.080
Teresa, no one left.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.440
Do you know why?

17:52.320 --> 17:54.800
Because it's not a failure
until someone says it's over.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.080
In my experience, hope only dies
when you decide to fail.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.800
Okay, um...

18:06.280 --> 18:09.320
I've got a couple of days' worth
of hormone shots left in my bag.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.640
- I should keep taking them, right?
- Definitely.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.480
You're gonna go home, Teresa.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.480
Isn't that right?

18:45.440 --> 18:46.920
I reckon I still got it.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.560
- I was just...
- We were just, um...

18:53.880 --> 18:55.400
- Allocating beds.
-  Yep.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.200
Yes, it's excellent spring coil
for a chastity bed of its kind.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.280
Oh! Um, note it for 11F, please.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.200
Wait, you're allocating rooms?

19:04.200 --> 19:05.800
Can I bag the big prefect dorm?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.520
Uh, no. No, no, no.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.560
No way, Renee. 2F is mine.

19:10.080 --> 19:14.160
Wait, Sandy, did you... shower?

19:15.080 --> 19:17.560
Yeah. Okay, yeah. I fucking showered.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.760
I was covered in gluten and Vegemite.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.240
But I thought that we weren't
meant to be using any water or anything.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.200
Renee, if you were smart,
which you're obviously not,

19:27.200 --> 19:30.200
you'd shotgun a bed and hit the showers
before everybody else does.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.560
Because trust me, they will.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.760
Oh, and FYI, ladies,

19:34.760 --> 19:36.800
the water pressure still fucking sucks.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.240
2F, bitches.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.480
Know what, anything but a bunk bed.
Thank you.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.680
- You get all that?
- Yep.

19:46.080 --> 19:46.920
Dope.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.480
Is that ice cream?

19:50.480 --> 19:53.480
Since someone breached
the sisterly agreement,

19:53.480 --> 19:55.160
there's only frozen stuff left.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.520
Okay, Pepé, you try looking
for a limited edition tote

19:57.520 --> 19:58.720
on an empty stomach.

19:59.000 --> 19:59.920
Peas?

20:05.280 --> 20:09.080
Okay, so I found a few months' worth
of Prolexoft.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.800
Among other things.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.400
Thanks, Renee.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.800
Um, surely we'll be well and truly
out of here before you run out.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.400
Yeah.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.520
Oh, you don't have to worry
about any of that.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.760
Yeah, Zoe's been making sure
that nobody takes

20:32.760 --> 20:34.800
your old boarding school room from you.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.680
She did kind of tell us.
We just didn't listen.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.160
Yeah.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.320
I know.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.200
Come on, Sandy.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.040
Got enough bloody water troubles

20:53.040 --> 20:55.160
without you adding to them,
don't we, girls?

20:55.160 --> 20:56.720
- Hey?

20:59.960 --> 21:01.680
You didn't even wash up, Zoe.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.440
- Lauren...
- Three...

21:41.000 --> 21:42.280
Well, plumbing's fucked.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.040
Suck shit, Zoe.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.400
Literally.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.080
I needed that.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.800
That's karma.

22:17.320 --> 22:18.240
I knew it.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.840
We're fucked.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.680
And if we're destined to die in this dump,

22:22.680 --> 22:24.640
I need everybody to back
the fuck off of 2F, okay,

22:24.640 --> 22:25.920
because there is no chance

22:25.920 --> 22:29.120
I am sleeping in a goddamn
bunk bed like a little prison bitch.

22:29.120 --> 22:32.600
- Sandy.
- Especially you, Zoe "bird shit" Miller.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.160
Sandy, settle down.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.760
Tegan and Megan have allocated the dorms.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.320
Everyone's got a bed.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.400
Don't they, Forgettable Laura?

22:41.920 --> 22:42.920
Um...

22:43.640 --> 22:45.280
Yeah, they just gave me the clipboard.

22:46.040 --> 22:46.960
Said go with it.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.040
Oh, my God. They are out there
shotgunning 2F.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.760
- Fuck this!
- It's a system, actually.

22:53.760 --> 22:56.080
- Don't you dare!

23:06.840 --> 23:09.080
Didn't think I'd see you again.

23:21.800 --> 23:22.720
Thanks.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.760
It's been in eventful day.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.640
I won't bore you with the details,
but in short...

23:29.080 --> 23:31.320
We're already out of fresh food and water.

23:32.880 --> 23:36.080
There are dozens of us,
and we might be here for months.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.000
Well, it sounds like you're all over it.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.320
They're not afraid of me.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.520
I know that I hurt you, Amelia.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.120
And...

23:49.280 --> 23:51.160
please know that I am sorry.

23:52.880 --> 23:58.000
But this authority that you all
look to me with, it's projected and...

23:58.520 --> 24:00.520
I never asked for any of it.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.920
Don't overthink it.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.360
We need a bitch.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.720
I don't do that shit any more.

24:21.200 --> 24:24.720
Thing is, Saskia, when you were captain,
we never lost a race.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.680
More like this.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.960
Stronger together!

24:43.400 --> 24:45.520
Bitch!

24:49.920 --> 24:53.560
Please! Please!
Think of the sisterly agreement.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.440
Sandy! Would you shut up already?

25:00.840 --> 25:03.640
Sandy, please, could you...
Please, could you cry a little quieter?

25:03.640 --> 25:06.480
I need to concentrate. Mitch usually does
these injections for me.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.640
I don't know why
you're bothering.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.400
Everything, including
your precious embryos, is dead.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.800
Sandy!

25:13.520 --> 25:15.240
Why don't we go look for your bag?

25:16.480 --> 25:17.400
Finally.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.760
- Okay.

25:31.480 --> 25:32.400
Ready?

25:35.920 --> 25:36.960
Done.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.720
Thank you, Saskia.

26:19.960 --> 26:20.920
Fuck!

26:22.480 --> 26:25.560
Why the fuck would my bag
be all the way down here?

26:25.560 --> 26:28.520
Maybe you left it here after
we collected the netballs last night.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.480
- Hey, guys, what's up?

26:31.120 --> 26:33.160
Jesus, Zoe. Don't do that, please.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.080
That's not my fucking bag.

26:35.080 --> 26:38.560
It's just stupid Zoe, living out
in the shed like the reject she is.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.960
Come on, mate. You wanna help us look
for a frigging handbag?

26:49.880 --> 26:50.800
Guess so.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.080
- Yeah, it's a good time.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.360
It's in the sinkhole.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.880
- I just know it.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.920
Sandra Dee, we're going
to try again tomorrow, okay?

27:05.360 --> 27:06.960
I just want to go home.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.800
I wish I never came.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.640
I know. I know.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.080
I hated this place.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.320
Really? God, I loved it.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.000
Never really shake it off, though, do you?

27:55.880 --> 27:57.960
I kind of feel like I've always been
last runner up.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.000
Well, you did try to tell us, Zo-Zo.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.000
It's just that this was unbelievable.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.760
How long do you think you could survive
out at sea on one of these things?

28:12.760 --> 28:15.800
Maybe like two, three days.
What do you reckon?

28:19.400 --> 28:21.800
I think anything is possible
until you decide to fail.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.960
And I've never once made that decision.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.720
-  Get up.
- Oh, yeah.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.360
Good? Come on.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.840
-  Oh, j...

28:52.200 --> 28:53.080
Oh...

28:54.840 --> 28:56.200
Oh, can you get my shoes?

28:56.200 --> 28:58.280
Sas?

29:02.120 --> 29:03.400
- Sas?
-  Yeah.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.760
Sas, wait. What the fuck did we just do?

29:06.640 --> 29:07.680
We have to go back.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.040
What are you talking about?
It was your idea

29:10.040 --> 29:12.320
to push Sandy out to sea
until she calms down.

29:12.320 --> 29:15.280
What? No. That wasn't...
That's not what I...

29:15.280 --> 29:17.240
That's what I meant.
I didn't mean push her out on the boat.

29:17.240 --> 29:18.920
I meant maybe if we don't get rescued,

29:18.920 --> 29:20.720
we're going to have to leave
on a fucking boat, you know?

29:20.720 --> 29:22.240
- That is not what I...
- Right.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.040
So you can see how I got confused by that.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.960
Saskia, stop!

29:26.960 --> 29:30.040
Zoe, we will not survive
if we bring her back tonight.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.920
- Yes, we will.
- She's a virus, Zo.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.440
And if we allow her to infect the others
with her hopelessness,

29:35.440 --> 29:37.000
we will never get our shit together.

29:38.160 --> 29:41.840
Besides the, you know,
Southerly or whatever

29:41.840 --> 29:44.080
will blow her back by morning,
and the scare will probably do her good.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.640
Now come on.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.200
Thanks for saving my old room.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.880
Well, get out!

30:46.360 --> 30:47.320
Get out!

30:47.640 --> 30:50.360
Get out! Get out! Get out!

30:50.360 --> 30:51.920
Thank you.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.560
Shut the door, Zo-Zo.
