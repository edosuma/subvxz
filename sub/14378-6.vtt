WEBVTT

00:42.300 --> 00:45.400
[Thunder]

00:46.166 --> 00:48.450
[Evil laughter]

00:54.050 --> 00:55.016
Oh, yeah.

00:55.050 --> 00:57.216
How did I become
so deliciously evil?

00:57.250 --> 00:59.350
Oh, yeah, I remember.

00:59.383 --> 01:00.416
The seeds
of my glorious villainy

01:00.450 --> 01:04.116
were sown
a long, long time ago.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.166
Aah.

01:08.200 --> 01:11.083
It all seems but a faint
and distant revery now.

01:11.116 --> 01:13.166
But as I recall,
the basis of my evil

01:13.200 --> 01:14.333
can be traced back
to my birth.

01:14.366 --> 01:18.166
Back to the tranquil village
in which we lived.

01:21.366 --> 01:24.066
Ah, the tranquil village
of flowertopia,

01:24.100 --> 01:26.450
an idealized world
of peace and Harmony,

01:26.483 --> 01:29.233
a place where man and beast
live side by side,

01:29.266 --> 01:31.383
a place where unity
and goodness prevail,

01:31.416 --> 01:34.133
a place where even the wind
smelt of happiness.

01:34.166 --> 01:37.416
Bleah! It makes me sick
just to think about it!

01:38.366 --> 01:42.116
But there amongst
the fragrant flowers
and radiant landscape,

01:42.150 --> 01:43.416
I became
the firstborn love child

01:43.450 --> 01:46.000
of wind bear and ocean bird.

01:46.033 --> 01:48.200
A.k.a. Mother and father.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.066
That's it,
sweetheart.

01:50.100 --> 01:51.066
Find your center,

01:51.100 --> 01:54.366
breathe,
and release.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.033
Mandark: And with that
last maternal exhalation,

01:58.066 --> 02:01.050
I, mandark,
monarch of darkness,

02:01.083 --> 02:02.333
came to be.

02:17.083 --> 02:18.166
Oh, wind bear,

02:18.200 --> 02:21.250
isn't he just
the most beautiful
creature ever?

02:21.283 --> 02:23.466
Why, he's as groovy
as moon dust,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.033
and as exquisite
as golden starlight.

02:27.066 --> 02:28.350
He's as pure and lovely

02:28.383 --> 02:32.233
as our terrestrial
sphere itself.

02:32.266 --> 02:33.316
With the head to match.

02:33.350 --> 02:38.100
Therefore I, wind bear,
shall bestow unto you

02:38.133 --> 02:41.333
a name beyond
the conforms of society.

02:41.366 --> 02:44.266
And I, ocean bird,
request a name

02:44.300 --> 02:48.066
without preconceived
gender connotations.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.083
A name that's
whispered softly

02:50.116 --> 02:52.133
through
the canyon winds.

02:52.166 --> 02:55.116
You shall
be named...

02:55.150 --> 02:56.333
Susan.

02:56.366 --> 02:58.016
Waah! Waah!

02:58.050 --> 03:01.250
Mandark: And so by some
cruel and twisted cosmic joke,

03:01.283 --> 03:03.400
I, mandark,
crown prince of dark forces,

03:03.433 --> 03:06.433
had been born into a world
of warm-hearted tenderness.

03:06.466 --> 03:08.416
I was the direct
genetic descendant

03:08.450 --> 03:12.083
of gentle, loving,
happy pacifists.

03:13.316 --> 03:15.216
But no amount
of compassion and humanity

03:15.250 --> 03:17.350
could dampen
my true nature within!

03:17.383 --> 03:20.166
[Evil laughter]

03:26.233 --> 03:28.450
As the size
of my colossal cranium
increased,

03:28.483 --> 03:32.116
so did my ever-evolving
evil intellect.

03:34.483 --> 03:37.266
[Evil laughter]

03:38.400 --> 03:40.433
Mandark: And even in my most
infantile state of mind,

03:40.466 --> 03:42.033
I knew there was something else

03:42.066 --> 03:45.000
beyond the peaceful life
my parents provided me.

03:45.033 --> 03:46.050
Then suddenly,

03:46.083 --> 03:48.200
it seemed to have
appeared out of nowhere.

03:48.233 --> 03:50.266
Its icy-cool mechanical casing,

03:50.300 --> 03:53.066
its complex composite
of twisted circuitry,

03:53.100 --> 03:56.383
its tangled web
of expertly engineered
cybernetics.

03:56.416 --> 03:58.050
This object,

03:58.083 --> 04:00.250
with its calculated,
methodically designed
exactness,

04:00.283 --> 04:02.266
this object was a revelation.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.400
It was a part of me.

04:03.433 --> 04:06.216
It was...It was...

04:11.350 --> 04:12.300
Science!

04:12.333 --> 04:14.316
I knew that
if I could only master

04:14.350 --> 04:15.400
this thing called science,

04:15.433 --> 04:18.050
and combine it
with my natural wickedness,

04:18.083 --> 04:20.366
I could control the world!

04:22.116 --> 04:24.133
But my plans
for total global domination

04:24.166 --> 04:25.100
would have to wait,

04:25.133 --> 04:26.133
for it would seem my parents

04:26.166 --> 04:29.050
had a different idea
for my development.

04:31.266 --> 04:34.283
Waah! Waah!

04:53.416 --> 04:55.400
Yes, the days of my infancy
were filled

04:55.433 --> 04:58.100
with one tedious activity
after another.

04:58.133 --> 05:02.233
And all of them
so very, very UN-sciency.

05:09.383 --> 05:13.383
Happy annual name day
celebration!

05:13.416 --> 05:15.150
As the guest
of honor,

05:15.183 --> 05:18.483
Susan gets to wear
the festival wreath.

05:19.016 --> 05:20.433
Oh, how precious!

05:20.466 --> 05:22.383
And I bet I know
who wants some

05:22.416 --> 05:26.000
tofu squares
and rice cakes.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.300
No!!

05:35.266 --> 05:37.233
No more tofu!

05:37.266 --> 05:39.116
No more flowers!

05:41.466 --> 05:42.366
I want meat!

05:42.400 --> 05:48.066
And I want science!!

05:48.100 --> 05:50.183
Oh, wind bear,
whatever are we to do

05:50.216 --> 05:53.133
about our little Susan's
unnatural request

05:53.166 --> 05:55.250
for beef and technology?

05:55.283 --> 05:57.216
Rest easy,
ocean bird.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.083
This is probably
just a stage

05:59.116 --> 06:01.000
he's going through.

06:08.283 --> 06:11.100
Well, perhaps
we have neglected

06:11.133 --> 06:13.100
some of the boy's needs.

06:13.133 --> 06:15.150
Both: Hmmm.

06:15.183 --> 06:16.466
Let's drop out!

06:17.000 --> 06:18.416
Groovy!

06:20.150 --> 06:22.350
Mandark: So we packed up
the incense and herbal teas

06:22.383 --> 06:23.433
and set out to see the world,

06:23.466 --> 06:25.466
in the hope of my parents
that the experience

06:26.000 --> 06:28.266
would squelch my dark desires.

06:46.183 --> 06:48.316
[Coyote howls]

06:48.350 --> 06:51.383
Yes, we traveled the world over,
and then some,

06:51.416 --> 06:53.166
but it made no difference to me.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.166
I still longed to commit

06:54.200 --> 06:57.283
acts of science
in the name of evil.

06:57.316 --> 06:59.383
But trapped in the prison
of mere boyhood,

06:59.416 --> 07:02.050
and forced to endure
every whim of my parents,

07:02.083 --> 07:05.283
I was afraid I was never
going to get the chance.

07:13.216 --> 07:15.350
Eventually our travels
came to an end,

07:15.383 --> 07:17.333
and my parents decided
it was time

07:17.366 --> 07:18.400
to take root once again.

07:18.433 --> 07:21.116
So we settled down
in a nice little community

07:21.150 --> 07:22.233
in a nice little home

07:22.266 --> 07:24.466
in complete nowheresville.

07:27.150 --> 07:28.466
Little did I know
I was about to encounter

07:29.000 --> 07:31.466
the moment that would
alter my life forever.

07:34.283 --> 07:37.000
[Humming]

07:37.166 --> 07:39.050
Yes, that should do it.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.133
And once again,

07:40.166 --> 07:42.283
thanks to my magnificent
and astounding genius,

07:42.316 --> 07:45.033
science can
hold its head up proudly.

07:45.066 --> 07:47.033
Let's turn it on!

07:49.133 --> 07:52.333
Ah! Oh, hey,
what happened?

07:52.366 --> 07:54.300
Hey, what gives?

07:54.333 --> 07:56.016
Hey!

07:56.050 --> 07:57.233
Hey!

08:09.316 --> 08:13.233
Science. Wow.

08:13.266 --> 08:17.050
Wow. Mmm.

08:17.083 --> 08:18.083
Hey, hey, hey.

08:18.116 --> 08:20.116
What is that
that you are
doing there?

08:20.150 --> 08:21.366
Stop that,
stop that.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.050
This here is
very complicated

08:23.083 --> 08:24.483
high-tech scientific
type of stuff

08:25.016 --> 08:28.050
of which you cannot
possibly comprehend.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.100
I love science.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.466
It's just that
my parents, well,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.416
and the moving around,
and the love, and--

08:33.450 --> 08:34.333
yes, yes,

08:34.366 --> 08:35.433
I am sure
your life story

08:35.466 --> 08:37.383
is endlessly
entertaining.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.150
But if you'll
excuse me,

08:39.183 --> 08:41.300
I, Dexter,
boy genius,

08:41.333 --> 08:43.100
have much work
to be doing.

08:43.133 --> 08:45.266
So to you,
I bid adieu.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.216
Good-bye,
little girl.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.116
Oh, I'm not
a little girl.

08:49.150 --> 08:51.483
I'm a little boy,
just like you.

08:56.083 --> 09:00.266
Hmm. What is the name
by which you are called?

09:00.300 --> 09:04.283
Uh, my name is...

09:04.316 --> 09:06.050
Susan.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.383
[Laughing loudly]

09:13.266 --> 09:14.316
Mandark, voice-over:
Oh, that laugh,

09:14.350 --> 09:17.200
that annoying chuckle,
that irritating chortle.

09:17.233 --> 09:20.216
At that moment,
something within me snapped.

09:21.016 --> 09:22.133
And it was as if all the evil

09:22.166 --> 09:24.166
that had been suppressed
inside of me for so many years

09:24.200 --> 09:25.183
had suddenly been unleashed

09:25.216 --> 09:27.383
to every fiber
of my organic structure,

09:27.416 --> 09:30.066
and I could feel the power.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.350
I knew what must be done.

09:36.183 --> 09:38.283
I was going to build
the biggest, most astounding,

09:38.316 --> 09:41.200
most incredibly evil
scientific laboratory ever!

09:41.233 --> 09:45.433
Putting anything
that insignificant Dexter
had ever made to shame!

09:47.100 --> 09:49.250
Voice-over:
But to achieve my goal,
I could no longer be

09:49.283 --> 09:51.450
a long-haired girly-named
boy anymore.

09:51.483 --> 09:53.050
No!

09:53.083 --> 09:55.450
Voice-over: I would assume
a new, evil identity.

10:03.466 --> 10:05.216
And now I only needed
a new name,

10:05.250 --> 10:08.000
a name to match the darkness
that flowed through me,

10:08.033 --> 10:11.033
a name that told of the man
I knew I could be.

10:11.066 --> 10:12.216
I was now--

10:12.250 --> 10:13.216
mandark!

10:13.250 --> 10:14.400
And my sole purpose,

10:14.433 --> 10:17.233
to be the greatest,
most evillest boy genius
scientist

10:17.266 --> 10:18.316
the world has ever known.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.483
And to destroy
Dexter's laboratory!

10:21.016 --> 10:23.300
[Evil laughter]

10:28.316 --> 10:30.033
And today is my day!

10:30.066 --> 10:31.233
The future is now!

10:31.266 --> 10:34.066
[Evil laughter]

10:38.033 --> 10:39.400
Wind bear: Ahem.

10:39.433 --> 10:42.050
Now Susan,
you know
how we feel

10:42.083 --> 10:44.366
about using
implements
of destruction.

10:44.400 --> 10:47.050
My name
is mandark.

10:47.083 --> 10:48.350
No, it's Susan.

10:48.383 --> 10:50.300
Now put that away
and come join

10:50.333 --> 10:53.200
our bonding chant
ritual, Susan.

10:53.233 --> 10:56.033
Yes, mother.

10:56.066 --> 10:57.350
[Sighs]

10:57.383 --> 11:00.266
I'll get you one day, Dexter.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.383
One day.

11:22.366 --> 11:28.200
Ok, let's see how p-290
and p-291 are doing.

11:28.233 --> 11:30.050
[Electronic beeping]

11:30.083 --> 11:32.083
Looking good, guys.

11:32.116 --> 11:34.366
Now for the l-2-4-7.

11:34.400 --> 11:40.166
Hmm. Your productivity
has increased 72%!

11:40.200 --> 11:42.150
You go, girl.

11:42.183 --> 11:45.183
Ok, next robot for review.

11:45.216 --> 11:48.283
Ah, the q-t-411.

zu zu.

11:52.033 --> 11:56.000
Wow, q-t. Much better
than yesterday.

11:56.033 --> 11:59.333
Thank you,
Dexter, sir.

[Glass shatters]

12:01.033 --> 12:04.083
Ooh. What do we have here?

12:04.116 --> 12:07.200
Well, see you later,
q-t. Bye-bye.

12:07.233 --> 12:10.116
Um, Dexter, sir,

12:10.150 --> 12:12.150
I'm really sorry.

[Smash]

12:13.450 --> 12:17.016

12:19.033 --> 12:22.116
Let's see. Hmm,
who have we got left?

12:22.150 --> 12:26.033
The fast response executing
droid and the m.A.R.-10.

12:26.066 --> 12:32.200
Just two more robots to check,
then sleepy d checks into bed.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.000
Yeah! Yeah!

Oh, boy!
Shake it, me.

12:38.066 --> 12:40.466
Shake it! Yeah!

Yeah! Woo!

Excuse me.

Whoa! Hey, what the...?

13:02.050 --> 13:03.216
Who turned off the...?

13:03.250 --> 13:05.166
Oh, hi, cutie.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.000
Why aren't
you two working?

13:07.033 --> 13:08.383
To set the record
straight,

13:08.416 --> 13:11.283
I was. I was working.

13:11.316 --> 13:12.433
No, you were dancing.

13:12.466 --> 13:15.450
See, i--i can tell that
you're the type of guy

13:15.483 --> 13:17.266
that needs some
reassurance

13:17.300 --> 13:19.200
that work
is getting done.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.266
Am I right here?
Yeah, I am.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.283
Let me just start by saying
that Fred and I

13:22.316 --> 13:25.116
have been working
the whole time.

13:25.150 --> 13:26.166
But what happened, you see,

13:26.200 --> 13:28.316
was our tools broke
from being overworked.

13:28.350 --> 13:31.416
So we got this guy
to get us some new tools.

13:31.450 --> 13:33.250
So, in the meantime,
Fred and I

13:33.283 --> 13:37.400
have been on this really
UN-unneeded work break.

13:38.233 --> 13:40.200
[Beeping]

13:40.233 --> 13:43.316
Those must be
your tools.

13:43.350 --> 13:45.366
No, tiny.
Don't you remember

13:45.400 --> 13:50.266
I said tools, not--
not drinks. Tools.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.433
Actually, m.A.R.-10,

13:51.466 --> 13:53.350
you did ask tiny
to bring you a drink,

13:53.383 --> 13:55.300
then you asked me
if I wanted one

13:55.333 --> 13:56.283
and I said yes,

13:56.316 --> 13:58.183
because you know
how parched I get

13:58.216 --> 13:59.416
after I dance.

13:59.450 --> 14:02.166
Well, you two
are stupid.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.366
No, all 3 of you
are stupid.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.350
And if your cute little
attitudes and productivity

14:07.383 --> 14:09.383
do not change
by the time I get back,

14:09.416 --> 14:12.150
you will be 3
little cubes of steel.

14:12.183 --> 14:15.000
See you guys later.

14:15.033 --> 14:16.116
I'm outta here.

14:16.150 --> 14:19.216

you're out of here?

14:25.200 --> 14:27.100
You think I'm gonna
stick around here

14:27.133 --> 14:29.416
and get turned into
a cube of steel?

14:29.450 --> 14:31.266
Ha ha ha. Right.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.483
You could
try working.

14:33.016 --> 14:34.283
Yeah, good idea,
Fred.

14:34.316 --> 14:36.350
I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

is that crazy thing?

14:40.283 --> 14:42.150
Oh, it's my
escape tunnel, Fred.

14:42.183 --> 14:46.100

escape tunnel.

14:48.350 --> 14:49.233
Where's it go?

14:49.266 --> 14:52.016
It goes to
freedom, Fred.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.116
It goes to america.

14:54.150 --> 14:57.416
In america, the streets
are paved with parties,

14:57.450 --> 15:01.116
and there never is a party
where you can't find m.A.R.-T.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.266
Oh, I have to remember that.

look like?

17:26.483 --> 17:28.450
there has been some

17:28.483 --> 17:31.400
Just like you guys,
you see, I'm a biker.

17:31.433 --> 17:32.433
I'm also a comedian,

17:32.466 --> 17:35.000
and that's why
it's funny, you see,

17:35.033 --> 17:36.183
that I called you a girl,
