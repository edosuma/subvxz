WEBVTT

00:10.718 --> 00:12.386
Okay. All set.

00:12.386 --> 00:13.763
Gimme one of those laughs again, Joss.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.682
That's great, yeah.

00:18.851 --> 00:20.478
Gimme some innocence now.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.523
That's great. Right down the barrel.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.900
And some doe-eye looks.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.070
Beautiful.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.031
Now mischievous.

00:34.867 --> 00:36.369
Play with the camera.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.248
Okay. Pure sex now.

00:44.460 --> 00:45.503
That's good.

00:46.879 --> 00:49.298
Gimme vulnerable.

00:52.468 --> 00:53.594
Beautiful.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.056
And now emotional.

01:05.773 --> 01:06.983
That's beautiful.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.117
I'm stepping in.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.578
- Can we also get hair?
- Okay.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.601
Can we get a water?

02:28.564 --> 02:31.567
Okay. All right, let's see.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.908
Joss.

02:43.704 --> 02:45.540
Time to get up, Joss.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.919
Coffee's on the table.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.088
Thank you.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.507
<i>But what is the image saying?</i>

03:36.507 --> 03:38.801
That she's young, beautiful,
and damaged.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.344
Not damaged.

03:40.344 --> 03:42.472
She had problems
that she overcame beautifully.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.266
Okay. The robe, the hospital wristband.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.227
Are we romanticizing mental illness?

03:48.227 --> 03:49.645
Absolutely.

03:49.645 --> 03:50.730
And you're fine with that?
That's cool?

03:50.730 --> 03:52.774
You people are so out of touch.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.025
- Here we go.
- You people?

03:54.025 --> 03:56.069
You college-educated internet people.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.279
You're criticizing me
for going to college.

03:58.279 --> 04:01.991
Will you let people enjoy sex, drugs,
and hot girls, okay?

04:01.991 --> 04:03.576
Stop trying to cock-block America.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.745
No, Nikki, I'm not some sort of prude.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.581
I just don't think that with
everything that she has been through,

04:08.581 --> 04:09.957
she should be wearing
a hospital wristband.

04:09.957 --> 04:12.210
Mental illness is sexy.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.586
- No, it's not.
- Yeah.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.838
if you live in Sioux City, Iowa,

04:15.838 --> 04:18.216
you are never gonna meet a girl
like Jocelyn.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.801
She's not walking down the street.

04:20.301 --> 04:23.262
She didn't go to your high school.
She doesn't work at the bar or the diner.

04:23.262 --> 04:25.556
And she did not marry your best friend.

04:25.556 --> 04:29.727
And if, on the off chance, she did,
she is still never, ever gonna fuck you.

04:29.727 --> 04:33.856
Unless, she has some very,
very serious mental problems.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.609
And that right there
is why mental illness

04:36.609 --> 04:38.277
is sexy.

04:38.277 --> 04:41.197
Great. Keep lookin', right here.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.033
It's a pretty good point.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.576
Oh, beautiful.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.495
Yeah. Extend yourself. Yeah.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.789
Oh, playful. I like it.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.166
- I'm sorry.
- Could I just get one second?

04:52.166 --> 04:54.252
No, actually, this can't wait.
Can you--

04:54.252 --> 04:56.295
So sorry, Jocelyn. Be right back.

04:56.295 --> 04:58.506
She's doin' great, you gotta admit.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.758
- Gorgeous.
- I mean, not since Brigitte Bardot.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.679
A little Sharon Tate.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.055
Oh, God forbid.

05:06.055 --> 05:10.643
According to the nudity rider,
we only can show the side boob,

05:10.643 --> 05:12.979
the under boob, and the side flank.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.939
I didn't ask. She did it.

05:16.315 --> 05:19.444
- Is there a problem?
- I'll let you handle this one.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.448
Her areola is clearly visible.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.949
- Yeah, it looks great.
- Be that as it may,

05:24.949 --> 05:27.034
we can't actually do this.

05:27.034 --> 05:28.703
- We can't do what?
- Show her breasts.

05:28.703 --> 05:29.620
Yeah?

05:29.620 --> 05:31.539
The nudity rider's already been negotiated

05:31.539 --> 05:33.499
with the label and her people and--

05:33.499 --> 05:35.543
- How are you?
- Hi. What are we talking about?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.211
- Your tits.
- Your nudity rider.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.173
- It's very strict.
- It is my body.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.716
Yes. Yes, it is

05:41.716 --> 05:43.468
and no one is arguing that.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.512
If you want to show your body,
which would be great,

05:46.512 --> 05:48.139
we have to change the nudity rider.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.391
Okay, so let's fucking change
the nudity rider.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.602
Well, it takes at least 48 hours.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.855
Okay, so I'm not allowed to show my body?

05:57.190 --> 06:00.860
Not in the general, like,
human rights structure of it all.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.279
Chaim, you need to get off the phone.
There's an emergency.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.323
- What, what?
- It's an emergency. I need you over here.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.951
You realize how fucking annoying
and insane that sounds?

06:08.951 --> 06:10.536
It's actually very progressive.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.455
It's to make sure
she doesn't feel pressured.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.581
Right. I don't feel pressured.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.751
- Fully respect that.
- This is her album cover.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.670
It's also my boob and my house.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.256
Fully respect body autonomy.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.176
Juan, I gotta go. All right.
I'll talk to you later.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.552
Chaim?

06:27.345 --> 06:28.513
Chaim?

06:28.513 --> 06:30.473
- What? What?
- I gotta show you somethin'.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.766
- Here.
- What is that?

06:31.766 --> 06:33.684
- This photo just leaked.
- Eleven minutes ago.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.771
- Yeah, but what, what is it?
- Chaimy, it's cum.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.440
- What?
- On her face.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.570
- What?
- Someone came

06:44.570 --> 06:47.782
on her face and then took a photo.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.325
You wanna get in closer?

06:51.119 --> 06:52.078
Oh my--

06:56.207 --> 06:58.543
- Who did that?
- I don't know, I don't know.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.710
That was a selfie? She took a picture--

06:59.710 --> 07:01.045
- That was--
- Yeah, you could tell by the angle.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.089
It's kind of, it's like a--

07:03.089 --> 07:04.257
She was on her fucking knees.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.926
- She wasn't standing.
- Yeah, well, and she was on the ground.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.553
Why would she do it to herself? What?

07:08.553 --> 07:09.929
- Why would--
- He probably was fine as shit,

07:09.929 --> 07:12.014
had a big-ass dick, and she felt good.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.891
She fuckin' famous!
She can't do that.

07:13.891 --> 07:16.352
- She can't fuckin' take a selfie--
- I will find out who it is.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.896
- I promise.
- Where and when?

07:18.896 --> 07:20.106
- You know who did this.
- I don't know.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.149
- You live here.
- You fucking know.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.692
- I know!
- Oh, you do too. Who the fu--

07:22.692 --> 07:25.987
Or I know who goes into the room,
but I don't know who--

07:25.987 --> 07:28.865
which of them came on her face.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.159
When I find who did this,
I'm gonna put a fuckin'

07:31.159 --> 07:32.660
bullet in his head.
You understand this?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.120
And that's gonna be on your head.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.246
But I'm also trying to be a good friend.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.414
- And now--
- You're not a fuckin' friend.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.541
- You work for her.
- Don't you fucking lie to me.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.792
I'm not!
It's only been 11 minutes.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.419
If you gave me 10 more--

07:41.419 --> 07:43.087
Well, how many fucking people could it be?

07:43.087 --> 07:45.381
- Well, just based on the period of the--
- Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.

07:45.381 --> 07:46.591
What's going on?

07:46.591 --> 07:48.384
- We're just ordering lunch.
- Hey.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.011
- How you doin'?
- Nothing. We just dealin'

07:50.011 --> 07:51.721
with a lotta bullshit over here.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.931
Chaim, this intimacy coordinator.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.600
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.268
All right. What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

07:57.268 --> 07:58.436
- What are we gonna do here?
- Chaim,

07:58.436 --> 08:00.730
take Jocelyn's phone and hide it from her.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.315
- Gimme her phone.
- I mean--

08:02.315 --> 08:03.566
She hasn't seen that shit, has she?

08:03.566 --> 08:05.359
- No.
- Make sure she doesn't.

08:05.359 --> 08:08.237
Jocelyn is in a actually
quite vulnerable position

08:08.237 --> 08:09.781
for all the power
and privilege that she has.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.074
Oh, yeah, she looks super vulnerable.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.408
This is actually a structural--

08:12.408 --> 08:13.993
- Hey, how you doin' today?
- Great.

08:13.993 --> 08:14.911
- Hi.
- Good.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.996
You and me gonna talk in private, okay?

08:16.996 --> 08:18.915
Well, we actually are just right
in the middle of something--

08:18.915 --> 08:21.084
Well, now you gonna be
in the middle of something else.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.460
All right? Come on.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.669
Thank you so much.

08:23.669 --> 08:27.006
Keep making the magic, everybody!
This way, come here.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.970
The person being photographed is saying
she wants to show her breasts.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.514
She's saying she wants to do it.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.683
Somebody bring that cat home
from the shelter.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.104
More nails like a kitty. Like a kitty cat.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.941
<i>I'm here to protect</i>

08:44.941 --> 08:48.444
this person that you care about with you.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.362
Is that right?

08:49.362 --> 08:50.571
- Yes!
- Well, I got it covered.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.948
Okay? So, thank you very much,

08:51.948 --> 08:54.534
but you don't need to do that
by fucking up the entire day.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.911
Yeah, it looks great.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.913
You'll thank me when you're 60.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.791
That's great.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.419
Little more nipple because
we got rid of the nipple police.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.003
<i>If she wants to be nude,</i>

09:06.003 --> 09:09.590
all we have to do is redo the rider
and come back in 48 hours.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.593
What am I supposed to do today?
I paid for this whole day already.

09:12.593 --> 09:16.139
So what are we supposed to do?
Just flush that money down the toilet?

09:17.390 --> 09:20.393
It's the price of safety.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.317
Let's go in-- Come in here.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.486
I don't want everybody to hear this.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.196
Please step in here.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.950
- That's a bathroom.
- It's a very big bathroom.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.785
Please, get the fuck in there.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.620
- What are you doing?!
- Price of fucking safety.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.749
Hey, hey! You! Come here!
You want $5,000?

09:42.749 --> 09:45.460
You keep this door shut
for the next three hours.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.545
Three. Hold it.
You gotta hold it really hard.

09:47.545 --> 09:48.713
- Who's in here?
- All right?

09:48.713 --> 09:51.090
None of your business.
Just take it or leave it, yes?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.884
- Yeah? Okay, good.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.719
This is, like, $2,000.

09:54.719 --> 09:58.848
I give you the rest later.
Don't let him out of there!

09:58.848 --> 10:00.683
Oh, my God.

10:00.683 --> 10:04.979
Okay, all right! Thank you, Daniel!

10:04.979 --> 10:08.149
You did a great job!
Everybody feels real safe.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.695
But wait, if the music's getting louder,
then somebody has to have my phone.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.864
Why would you police those tits?

10:15.198 --> 10:16.157
- Great. Beautiful.
- Why?

10:16.157 --> 10:18.534
- Can I borrow you for a minute?
- Okay.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.453
- This way, please.
- I'll be back.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.167
Google Jocelyn right now.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.252
- Google Jocelyn.
- Yup.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.132
- Images?
- Yup.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.886
- What?
- Yeah.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.472
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.517
- Does she know about this?
- No, she does not know about it.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.685
- Okay?
- What the fuck. Who did this?

10:44.685 --> 10:46.687
We don't know, but we gotta deal with it.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.731
That brazen little minx. Fuck!

10:48.731 --> 10:50.149
Benjamin is here. Let's go talk.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.360
What the hell are we gonna do

10:52.360 --> 10:54.237
when she sees this photo
and she has a psychotic break?

10:54.237 --> 10:56.114
Yeah, that's why we have
to keep it from her as long as possible.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.490
She's not going to have a psychotic break.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.908
Eventually, she's gonna set it.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.535
No one's having a psychotic--

11:00.535 --> 11:02.495
- Let's all calm down.
- Yeah, please. Deep breath.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.746
Okay. I'm gonna give some information.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.997
I need it to be received

11:04.997 --> 11:07.458
peacefully, calmly. Okay?

11:07.458 --> 11:09.585
We're the number one
trending topic on Twitter.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.254
- Okay. All right.
- It's not...

11:11.254 --> 11:13.256
- No. I find out who did this.
- ...a bad--

11:13.256 --> 11:16.092
May God have mercy on their fucked up,
depraved soul. Okay?

11:16.092 --> 11:18.094
The photo could be worse.
It could be worse.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.637
- It could be worse?
- Yeah.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.889
- How is that fuckin' possible?
- Well, with Jocelyn,

11:21.889 --> 11:23.015
anything is fuckin' possible.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.184
I don't mean to be a cynic--

11:25.184 --> 11:27.895
- Hi. Hi.
- Oh, Talia, hi!

11:27.895 --> 11:31.023
- Nikki, hello.
- Hi, hello. You look fantastic.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.526
- You look chic.
- Thank you so much.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.862
Hey! I'm Chaim. I'm Jocelyn's manager.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.530
Talia Hirsch, "Vanity Fair."

11:37.530 --> 11:39.407
"Vanity Fair." Okay. How you doing?

11:39.407 --> 11:40.867
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.326
Wow. "Vanity"-- Okay.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.619
- How are you doing?
- Oh, you know.

11:43.619 --> 11:46.080
We've been a little bit better.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.754
You know what,
I think I left it on the bathroom sink.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.715
We'll find it.
Let's just get you ready for rehearsal.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.800
I left it literally right there.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.845
Really? That's so weird.

12:00.845 --> 12:04.223
Who hasn't? Who among us
has not had cum on their face?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.058
- Okay.
- I think it used to be fun.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.351
- Didn't it used to be f--
- Anyway--

12:07.351 --> 12:09.687
Wasn't that a hot date years ago?

12:09.687 --> 12:11.898
- Oh, boy.
- I'm just saying.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.733
She's been through a lot.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.651
What's disgusting is the fact that

12:15.651 --> 12:18.404
people aren't looking at her
as the victim in all of this.

12:18.780 --> 12:19.781
Is everything okay?

12:19.781 --> 12:21.365
Yeah, everything's fine.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.201
Really? What were you guys
talking about out there?

12:24.035 --> 12:26.412
Nothing.
Joss, the dancers have been outside

12:26.412 --> 12:28.206
for, like, 45 minutes in the hot sun--

12:28.206 --> 12:30.249
- Ah, fuck, really?
- Let's just get you changed.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.168
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.796
- Go! More, more, more!
- Her mother died of cancer.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.089
I mean, Jocelyn was there.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.883
The morphine, and the thing,
and holding her mother's hand

12:38.883 --> 12:40.760
till the last breath, the death rattle,
the whole thing.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.971
We don't need to go deep on that,
but she is prioritizing wellness,

12:43.971 --> 12:46.265
which is, I think,
a really important thing.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.810
Yeah, like that Black girl
in the Olympics.

12:48.810 --> 12:49.894
You know the one.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.188
The American hero one.
Right?

12:52.188 --> 12:54.232
- Yeah, Simone Biles.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.943
It's gotta say,
it's gotta say "revenge porn."

12:56.943 --> 12:59.028
It's gotta say "revenge porn"
or they're not gonna take it down.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.655
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Andrew Finkelstein.

13:00.655 --> 13:01.989
- Do you have ID?
- <i>Revenge porn?</i>

13:01.989 --> 13:04.659
Yeah. No, I'm from Live Nation.
I've been here many, many times.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.285
- Listen, that's what--
- That's great. Do you have ID?

13:06.285 --> 13:07.912
No, I don't fuckin' have ID!

13:07.912 --> 13:10.456
But, ultimately, you know,
we've pushed the tour,

13:10.456 --> 13:12.375
we've refunded the tickets,

13:12.375 --> 13:15.086
and that, I think, for something--
for someone of that age

13:15.086 --> 13:16.963
is a really courageous thing.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.297
But the tickets are back on sale.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.340
Yeah.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.134
The new single drops in two weeks.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.302
- It's incredible.
- It's lights out.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.138
- Honestly, this song-- I love this song.
- It's good.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.432
- It's good. It's good.
- "World Class Sinner" it's called.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.100
- Listen to me, it's gotta--
- There's a lotta people here today.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.227
- We can't let anyone in without an ID.
- Jesus fucking--

13:31.227 --> 13:32.603
Okay, let me deal
with this fuckin' jabroni.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.939
Hang on. I'm gonna Google myself.
Here, watch this. Ready?

13:34.939 --> 13:38.317
"Andrew Finkelstein, Live Nation."

13:38.317 --> 13:42.363
What? Whoa, who's that?
See that <i>punim?</i>

13:42.363 --> 13:43.698
See this face? See that face?
Wow, they're similar.

13:43.698 --> 13:44.991
Okay, okay, sir, calm down.
You don't have to be

13:44.991 --> 13:46.242
so rude about it.
I'll get this figured out, okay?

13:46.242 --> 13:47.660
Yeah, I don't have to be so rude.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.912
You know, my fucking star client
has a face full of cum.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.998
I'm not rude.
That's fine, no problem.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.917
Joss, Talia Hirsch
from "Vanity Fair" is here.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.211
She's probably just gonna ask you
some questions.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.921
Just tell her you're late.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.300
Do you need anything?
A water or anything?

14:02.300 --> 14:04.469
- I could do, like, a--
- Oh, hello!

14:04.469 --> 14:07.263
- Hi.
- Hi. Joss, meet Talia from "Vanity Fair,"

14:07.263 --> 14:09.182
- one of the great pop culture writers.
- Hi.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.850
- I do profiles.
- We do profiles.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.060
- So nice to meet you.
- It's so, so lovely to meet you.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.979
I actually grew up watching you
on "Rock House."

14:14.979 --> 14:16.647
Oh, my God, that is so sweet.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.983
I'm really excited to talk to you.
I'm just in the middle of something,

14:18.983 --> 14:20.276
- but I'll come find you later, okay?
- Yeah, for sure.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.527
I'm sure it's been a lot today.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.322
Yeah, so nice to meet you.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.240
- Yeah. See you.
- I'll see you a little bit later.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.204
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Why?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.747
Just asking.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.084
- Hey!

14:36.084 --> 14:38.044
- Hi!
- Hi.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.922
We're goin' out tonight, you know that.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.632
- I don't know.
- No, don't be boring.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.842
So, no one's told her about the photo yet?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.385
- All right, dancers in positions!
- One sec.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.512
Let's go! Right there.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.931
Super wide. Sit in that right hip.

14:50.598 --> 14:51.808
Who should I ask?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.559
I am not the bad guy here.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.977
Finkelstein's at the gate.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.689
Let me call you back.
I'll call you back.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.358
What the fuck? Are you kidding me?

15:00.358 --> 15:01.692
Yeah, so, what you gonna do with him?

15:01.692 --> 15:03.069
Lock him in a closet, too?

15:03.069 --> 15:05.071
I'm just doin' my job, man.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.073
Remind me to let that guy out
at some point,

15:07.073 --> 15:08.908
- but not yet.
- All right.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.244
Mr. Finkelstein.
So sorry for the inconvenience.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.620
- Now you're sorry. Thank you.
- Right this way.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.706
You're a <i>mensch.</i>
Wonderful fucking service.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.836
Just send it now!
Twitter is calling her the human cum sock!

15:19.836 --> 15:21.504
Here we go! Seven. Eight.

15:21.504 --> 15:25.007
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Sharp six!

15:25.007 --> 15:27.718
Really hit these pictures, dancers.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.971
Arms up! Six. Seven. Eight.

15:29.971 --> 15:32.306
One! Two. And Three. And Four.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.934
I love how referential
the choreography is.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.811
- It's an homage.
- To Britney.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.271
Yeah, I mean,
I think what Britney and Jocelyn

15:38.271 --> 15:39.731
have gone through is really unique,

15:39.731 --> 15:41.441
but ultimately

15:42.066 --> 15:44.318
universal. You know?

15:44.318 --> 15:47.822
Look at what she's overcome.
You know, the press has been brutal

15:47.822 --> 15:48.906
with Britney as well.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.408
Like, people count them out,

15:50.408 --> 15:54.120
and this is Jocelyn saying,
"I will not be written off."

15:54.871 --> 15:55.705
Go!

15:55.705 --> 15:58.458
More, more, more! Come on, you're late!

15:58.458 --> 16:02.378
Two. Three. Hey! Come on, focus, Joss.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.965
Andrew Finkelstein,
my second favorite Jew.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.759
- Jesus Christ.
- How you doin'? You all right?

16:07.759 --> 16:10.470
I am not in the mood for
the Jewish shit today, Chaim, not today.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.680
I'm just saying,
if you're linking to the photo,

16:12.680 --> 16:15.391
you're part of the problem.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.560
If you link to the photo,
you're part of the problem.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.354
The teamwork on this fuckin' video.
I want you to see it.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.899
It's what you dream about,
but you never get.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.859
It's what I dream about--
Do you know what I dream about?

16:24.859 --> 16:27.028
I dream about 40,000-seat arenas

16:27.028 --> 16:28.738
- sold out across the United States.
- Me too, Andrew.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.948
Right now, that's a fucking pipe dream.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.992
- 'Cause tickets aren't selling.
- Okay. All right, all right.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.368
You know, you worry too much.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.703
- Just relax.
- I worry too much.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.330
My shareholders think I worry too little.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.248
Every time I fuckin' breathe in and out,

16:39.248 --> 16:41.918
- I hemorrhage money, for Christ's sake.
- Yeah, that's their job. Okay?

16:41.918 --> 16:44.128
Tell your shareholders
that everything's good.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.130
Tickets went on sale one week ago.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.673
Single hasn't dropped yet.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.008
- Relax.
- Relax?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.802
Have you seen this one?

16:50.802 --> 16:53.638
How are 14-year-old girls
gonna buy tickets for this

16:53.638 --> 16:55.890
when she's frosted like a Pop Tart?

16:55.890 --> 16:57.683
Can you breathe?

16:57.683 --> 16:59.936
Wanna get you a coffee or water?
What do you need?

16:59.936 --> 17:01.270
I'd like a Voss, please.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.357
Is that Andrew Finkelstein
from Live Nation?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.401
Oh, yeah, yes it is.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.070
- Oh, my God, Talia.
- Oh, my God! Xander!

17:09.070 --> 17:11.030
Well, yeah.
Of course, you guys are friends.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.991
- You look gorgeous, babe.
- Thank you! So do you.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.661
But you are a champion of women.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.622
No, I'm not being sarcastic.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.207
I'm trying to draw the connection.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.960
We follow each other on Twitter.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.962
I see the links that you post.

17:26.254 --> 17:28.756
Yeah,
and then you're linking to this photo.

17:30.508 --> 17:31.717
Good, come on! This is the end!

17:31.717 --> 17:32.969
I want it sharp!

17:33.803 --> 17:35.721
Five. Six. Seven!

17:35.721 --> 17:38.933
Arms up. You're late.
That should be on seven, not on eight.

17:38.933 --> 17:42.395
All right. That was okay.
We definitely need to do that again.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.272
You okay? You seem really tired.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.941
- Your snaps are, like, so tired.
- I know.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.985
You just need to commit.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.571
I just, like, I haven't slept at all.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.905
You know it.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.074
I think you should take a break.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.827
Dyanne!
Take a break, watch Dyanne do it.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.246
Go relax and watch.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.999
I mean, they look like
they're fuckin' extras in "Rent."

18:02.999 --> 18:05.418
- Okay, let's go!
- Andy Finkelstein,

18:05.418 --> 18:07.503
to what do we owe the pleasure?

18:07.503 --> 18:12.425
Well, my 15-year-old daughter today
sent me a photo I really wish she hadn't.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.304
Did you come all the way over here
to slut shame Jocelyn?

18:16.304 --> 18:19.390
Oh, there's no shame in being a slut,
case in point.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.851
I'm just worried she's having another
psychotic break.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.478
- No, no. No.
- But she never had a psychotic break.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.688
Never had one.
She was just exhausted

18:25.688 --> 18:27.148
- and she was tired.
- Joss! Joss!

18:27.148 --> 18:29.067
- She's tired.
- Look. See?

18:29.067 --> 18:30.735
- She's doin' great, okay?
- Hey, honey!

18:30.735 --> 18:34.447
Look at that. Now, does that look like
someone on the verge of a psychotic break?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.616
- Exactly.
- Joss!

18:36.616 --> 18:38.117
Keep your eyes on Dy.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.579
I want your eyes on her
for every little detail, okay?

18:41.579 --> 18:43.289
Walk! Power!

18:43.664 --> 18:46.250
Yes! Lick it! Spank it! Drop it!

18:47.043 --> 18:50.296
Hip, hip, hip! Around! Amazing, Dy!

18:50.296 --> 18:52.090
Yes! Exactly what I want.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.759
Yes, partners!

18:54.759 --> 18:57.637
She's a trouper.
She reminds me of myself at that age.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.765
Okay, the thought of you younger
is terrifying to me.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.100
I was having fun.

19:02.100 --> 19:05.061
I was getting fucked in the ass
of the Capitol Records building stairwell

19:05.061 --> 19:06.854
and then walking straight into meetings.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.148
Yeah, I remember.
I was the one fucking you.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.817
- Jesus Christ!
- Learn from the best.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.443
I'm so sorry.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.154
Can I just remind everybody that we
have "Vanity Fair" with us today?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.823
- So, if we could just...
- Oh, my God!

19:16.823 --> 19:18.658
- ...keep the shit-talk to a--
- Having her around

19:18.658 --> 19:20.743
is like living in communist China.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.079
- How's it been?
- Yeah, it's been good.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.831
You're doing her creative, right?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.666
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Cool.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.334
- Yeah.
- How the hell is that?

19:28.334 --> 19:32.004
It's good. We're all very excited
about the song, you know?

19:32.004 --> 19:36.259
But she's just fucking evolving
and embracing and it's inspiring.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.428
I think we're all very proud.

19:38.428 --> 19:41.097
Sexy! Push 'em away.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.057
Hi! Look at that, that little princess.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.396
<i>I'm just a freak, yeah</i>

19:48.396 --> 19:52.775
<i>So show me why you came</i>

19:54.736 --> 19:57.405
Sick! Incredible. Beautiful.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.282
So fucking good.

19:59.282 --> 20:03.035
Thank you. Thank you.
Joss, do you see that?

20:03.035 --> 20:04.871
You wanna jump in?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.290
God, I wish I could dance like you.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.416
Give it all you got, Joss.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.918
- This is the one.
- Ya ready?

20:12.336 --> 20:14.255
Are they all watching me?

20:15.590 --> 20:17.008
Joss, you got this.

20:17.508 --> 20:19.135
We're all here 'cause of you.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.971
All right, let's go. This is the one.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.182
Poses. Sit in that right hip, Joss!

20:24.182 --> 20:25.767
Okay, we're gonna crush this one.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.810
Energy, commitment.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.235
<i>You got this, Joss.</i>

20:47.580 --> 20:49.165
All right, let's do this.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.833
- Nina? You ready?
- All right. Here we go!

20:51.501 --> 20:54.504
All right, dancers in position.
Let me see those poses.

20:54.504 --> 20:55.588
And music!

20:55.588 --> 20:57.465
Five, six, seven, eight!

20:59.383 --> 21:02.804
Take your time.
Really feel it. Camera! Nice!

21:03.679 --> 21:05.306
Beautiful!

21:05.807 --> 21:07.100
Sharp!

21:07.100 --> 21:08.768
- Those eyes!
<i>- Baby it's hard to see</i>

21:08.768 --> 21:10.686
- Beautiful!
<i>- When you're lookin' at me</i>

21:10.686 --> 21:13.356
- Hop! Push 'em. Push!
<i>- But I do what I want</i>

21:13.689 --> 21:15.483
<i>- Don't give a fuck at all</i>
- Push him down, eyes up. Up!

21:15.483 --> 21:17.735
<i>- Lookin' for somethin' sweet</i>
- Hit it!

21:17.735 --> 21:19.737
<i>When it comes time to eat</i>

21:19.737 --> 21:21.280
- Eyes up!
<i>- You better start to run</i>

21:21.280 --> 21:23.116
<i>When I call</i>

21:23.533 --> 21:25.201
<i>'Cause I know that you don't</i>

21:25.201 --> 21:26.869
- Yeah! Almost make out!
<i>- Really know how to handle it</i>

21:26.869 --> 21:28.746
Make it really steamy!

21:28.746 --> 21:30.289
Let me feel the heat!

21:31.499 --> 21:33.793
<i>So, get down on your knees</i>

21:33.793 --> 21:36.295
- Yes, goddess! Beautiful, Joss.
<i>- And get ready to become my bitch</i>

21:36.295 --> 21:37.713
Nice!

21:39.966 --> 21:42.552
<i>I'm just a freak, yeah</i>

21:42.552 --> 21:46.681
<i>You know I want it bad</i>

21:49.100 --> 21:51.477
<i>And we can meet, yeah</i>

21:51.477 --> 21:55.022
<i>But I don't need to know your name</i>

22:13.666 --> 22:16.294
- Fuck! All right!
<i>- You can pull my hair</i>

22:16.294 --> 22:18.504
<i>- Touch me anywhere</i>
- Woo! Yes, get it!

22:18.504 --> 22:21.007
<i>- Ball and chain</i>
- This is it!

22:21.841 --> 22:24.218
- Yes!
<i>- I'm just a freak, yeah</i>

22:24.218 --> 22:25.470
Beautiful! Let's end this strong!

22:25.470 --> 22:27.930
<i>So show me why you came</i>

22:27.930 --> 22:29.974
Don't forget your energy!

22:29.974 --> 22:32.018
Five. Six. Seven!

22:33.352 --> 22:35.772
- Yes! Incredible!
- Fuck yeah!

22:38.024 --> 22:39.567
- I knew you had it.
- Good job, Joss!

22:39.567 --> 22:41.360
- That's exactly it.
- Good job!

22:41.360 --> 22:42.695
- Fucking stunning.
- Come on.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.572
She's one of the greatest stars
to ever live.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.699
Benjamin, did you get
the revised statement from Holly?

22:46.699 --> 22:48.743
- Revenge porn?
- Yeah, exactly that.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.787
Make sure that every dipshit
with a keyboard

22:50.787 --> 22:52.371
has it spoon-fed down
their fuckin' throat.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.581
But it's true?

22:53.581 --> 22:55.333
Well, if we say it is.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.920
- I'm in a "Twilight Zone" episode.
- All right, people.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.714
- Okay, see you later.
- We live to fight another day.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.883
- Hi, should we go in the sauna?
- Yeah, sure.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.593
Hey, Joss, Nikki and Chaim

23:05.593 --> 23:07.512
just wanna go over
a couple things really quick.

23:07.512 --> 23:08.763
They're in the living room.

23:08.763 --> 23:10.389
- Did you find my phone?
- Yeah, it's up there.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.557
- Okay, see you in there.
- Bye.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.267
I mean, it could be way worse.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.228
- There's, there's not--
- She's coming. I'll do it.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.813
- I'll do it.
- Oh, my God.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.731
Yeah, I'll do it, relax.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.358
I knew it.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.403
I knew it all day. I just had a feeling
something was going on.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.695
What is it?

23:27.365 --> 23:29.367
This just posted on the internet.

23:38.835 --> 23:39.961
This is everywhere?

23:39.961 --> 23:40.920
Yeah.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.631
We've subpoenaed Reddit.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.633
They're tracking down
the IP address that posted it.

23:45.633 --> 23:46.884
So we're on it.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.387
It's not a big deal.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.891
I mean, I feel like it
could be a lot worse.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.520
- Right? Right.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.896
- 100%.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.149
- Yeah. We're on it.
- Yeah.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.860
- Don't worry.
- Tomorrow, I wanna wake up to, like,

24:03.860 --> 24:06.612
150 Google Alerts telling me Jocelyn's

24:06.612 --> 24:08.364
some kind of feminist hero, right?

24:08.364 --> 24:09.824
- Okay. Yeah, me too.
- You can do that.

24:09.824 --> 24:12.118
But I'm gonna start with victim

24:12.118 --> 24:13.953
- and move up from there.
- Yeah.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.205
- Well, it's the same difference.
- I don't understand anything.

24:16.205 --> 24:18.416
How could it possibly be
any fucking worse?

24:18.416 --> 24:20.668
Just tell me a scandal that was worse,
recently!

24:20.668 --> 24:23.379
She's coming out of it
more famous than when she came in.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.965
- And that's! That's the win.
- Let's just put it that way.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.342
Oh, you think the--
That's gonna be the reaction to this?

24:28.342 --> 24:29.719
To what do they call this?

24:29.719 --> 24:31.888
The Bugooki?
The Banooki? The Bonaki?

24:31.888 --> 24:33.347
- What do they call the word?
- Bukkake.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.767
Bukkake. That's gonna make her
more famous than before?

24:35.767 --> 24:37.810
- Kim Kardashian's a billionaire.
- Well, it's n--

24:37.810 --> 24:40.855
I would say it's actually not
a bukkake because

24:40.855 --> 24:43.357
that's kind of--
that's multiple people, right?

24:43.357 --> 24:46.611
And this, I think it's just one.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.511
What was the name of that club?

26:07.400 --> 26:08.609
Back up, back up, back up!

26:30.798 --> 26:32.383
<i>We're here to drink.</i>

26:34.343 --> 26:35.762
<i>We're here to dance.</i>

26:36.679 --> 26:38.723
<i>We're here to fall in love.</i>

26:41.350 --> 26:42.852
<i>We're here to fuck!</i>

26:45.480 --> 26:47.315
<i>All those troubles outside,</i>

26:47.315 --> 26:49.525
<i>they do not exist
in this building right now.</i>

26:49.525 --> 26:50.693
<i>Fuck all that!</i>

26:50.693 --> 26:53.404
<i>This is a church for all you sinners.</i>

26:53.404 --> 26:55.114
<i>So, shots for everybody in here!</i>

26:55.114 --> 26:57.867
<i>On me! Let's go!</i>

26:59.160 --> 27:00.828
Could I just get a water, please?

27:00.828 --> 27:02.413
Have some fucking fun.
Loosen up.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.791
I know, it's just so loud in here.
I have to, like--

27:05.333 --> 27:07.168
- It's a fucking club.
- I know it's a club.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.462
Jocelyn's on a manhunt, I guess.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.089
<i>Just like a prayer I'll take you there</i>

27:11.089 --> 27:12.757
<i>I'll take you there</i>

27:13.174 --> 27:14.092
<i>It's like a dream</i>

27:15.218 --> 27:17.553
<i>Turn the music,
turn the music off for a second. Is that?</i>

27:18.554 --> 27:19.847
<i>Is that Jocelyn?</i>

27:19.847 --> 27:26.729
<i>Hold on, is that Jocelyn
on my dance floor in my club?</i>

27:27.397 --> 27:30.024
<i>Ah, no, no, no. You're an icon.</i>

27:30.358 --> 27:32.360
<i>You're a legend.</i>

27:32.360 --> 27:34.028
<i>Oh, my God, and you're so beautiful.</i>

27:34.028 --> 27:35.488
<i>I gotta, I gotta-- Can I--</i>

27:35.488 --> 27:37.990
<i>I gotta have a dance with you.
Can I dance with you?</i>

27:39.367 --> 27:43.079
<i>I'm gonna dance with you.
Yo, bring, bring that back.</i>

27:43.079 --> 27:45.248
<i>Turn that back. I'm comin',
I'm comin' over there.</i>

27:46.874 --> 27:49.001
Wait, is he actually coming over here?

27:50.336 --> 27:51.337
Who is he?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.172
Tedros. He owns the place.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.884
<i>In the midnight hour
I can feel a power</i>

27:57.218 --> 27:58.678
<i>Just like a prayer</i>

27:58.678 --> 28:00.596
<i>You know I'll take you there</i>

28:00.596 --> 28:02.640
- Yeah, I'm comin' over there.
<i>- When you call my name</i>

28:02.640 --> 28:04.851
<i>It's like a little prayer</i>

28:04.851 --> 28:06.894
<i>I'm down on my knees</i>

28:07.353 --> 28:09.230
<i>I wanna take you there</i>

28:09.230 --> 28:11.232
<i>In the midnight hour</i>

28:11.232 --> 28:13.317
<i>I can feel your power</i>

28:13.317 --> 28:15.027
<i>Just like a prayer</i>

28:15.027 --> 28:18.781
<i>You know I'll take you there</i>

28:18.781 --> 28:20.366
<i>Ah-ah</i>

28:20.366 --> 28:21.868
Come on, like this.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.955
<i>- Ah-ah, Ah-ah</i>
- Are you shy now?

28:25.955 --> 28:29.292
<i>- Life is a mystery</i>
- Oh, hey!

28:29.292 --> 28:33.504
<i>Everyone must stand alone</i>

28:33.504 --> 28:37.884
- There she is.
<i>- I hear you call my name</i>

28:38.551 --> 28:41.888
<i>And it feels like home</i>

28:41.888 --> 28:43.556
<i>Just like a prayer</i>

28:43.556 --> 28:45.850
<i>Your voice can take me there</i>

28:45.850 --> 28:47.852
<i>Just like a muse to me</i>

28:47.852 --> 28:49.771
<i>You are a mystery</i>

28:49.771 --> 28:51.773
<i>Just like a dream</i>

28:51.773 --> 28:53.775
<i>You are not what you seem</i>

28:53.775 --> 28:54.942
<i>Just like a prayer</i>

28:54.942 --> 28:56.652
You're dangerous.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.574
I mean, how could anyone
not fall in love with you?

29:02.200 --> 29:04.202
I don't even know you.

29:06.621 --> 29:08.748
<i>Just like a prayer I'll take you there</i>

29:10.416 --> 29:12.126
<i>- It's like a dream to me</i>
- Excuse me?

29:12.126 --> 29:13.461
Could I just get a water, please?

29:13.461 --> 29:15.379
It's been, like, seven minutes.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.465
Gimme a minute.

29:39.195 --> 29:41.114
You fit perfectly in my arms.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.335
<i>Your voice</i>

29:55.420 --> 30:00.091
<i>It's like an angel sighin'</i>

30:01.342 --> 30:03.970
<i>I have no choice</i>

30:03.970 --> 30:05.304
<i>I hear your</i>

30:05.304 --> 30:07.765
So, this is your place?
You own this place?

30:10.435 --> 30:12.186
Welcome to my shit hole.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.734
I've never fucked anyone
with a rattail before.

31:02.403 --> 31:03.738
A what?

31:03.738 --> 31:05.198
You have a rattail.

31:05.198 --> 31:07.700
A rattail? Is that what you called it?

31:13.539 --> 31:14.749
Joss?

31:16.250 --> 31:17.460
Joss?

31:25.051 --> 31:26.511
Joss?

31:29.472 --> 31:32.016
Joss? I have your bag.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.478
Who the fuck is that?

31:35.478 --> 31:36.896
Hey, Joss?

31:39.607 --> 31:41.609
Where the fuck is she?

31:44.445 --> 31:46.447
Hey, have any of you guys seen Joss?

31:48.074 --> 31:49.659
Where is she?

31:54.997 --> 31:56.165
She's gone.

31:56.165 --> 31:58.334
Jesus Christ.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.337
God.

32:03.464 --> 32:06.050
What a fuckin' boner killer.

32:06.050 --> 32:09.095
I know, she prevented us
from starting our family.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.930
I'm so sorry.

32:12.432 --> 32:13.433
Joss?

32:15.226 --> 32:16.227
Joss?

32:20.148 --> 32:21.566
Do you wanna dance?

32:22.525 --> 32:27.989
What? Oh, sorry. I'm looking for,
I'm looking for--

32:28.656 --> 32:30.074
Is that a yes?

32:33.077 --> 32:34.370
Yeah!

32:35.288 --> 32:37.415
All right, when can I hear this new album?

32:37.415 --> 32:38.750
Never.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.251
- Never?
- No.

32:40.251 --> 32:42.628
- Why the fuck not?
- Because it's, like, stupid,

32:42.628 --> 32:45.798
and I hate it
and you're gonna hate it, too.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.717
You hate it?
How can you put out something you hate?

32:47.717 --> 32:50.303
Well, you obviously don't work
in the music industry.

32:50.303 --> 32:52.263
Pop music is just

32:52.930 --> 32:55.266
- superficial.
- I think Prince would disagree with you.

32:55.266 --> 32:56.934
I love Prince.

32:56.934 --> 32:59.103
Are you gonna call
"When Doves Cry" fuckin' superficial?

32:59.103 --> 33:01.314
No, I love that song.

33:01.314 --> 33:03.566
If that song came out today,
it'd be a smash tomorrow.

33:03.566 --> 33:05.860
So, all I have to do is
make music like Prince?

33:05.860 --> 33:09.113
- I didn't say that.
- Easy. I'll just do that.

33:09.113 --> 33:11.240
- No. I didn't say that.
- Why didn't I think of that?

33:11.240 --> 33:13.242
You can't make music like Prince.

33:13.242 --> 33:16.913
Pop music is like
the ultimate Trojan Horse.

33:16.913 --> 33:19.749
Ya get people to dance,
ya get people to sing along.

33:19.749 --> 33:23.628
Could say whatever you want.
Shit's powerful.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.633
I like you.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.678
I like you, too.

33:35.765 --> 33:37.975
You got the best job in the world.

33:39.227 --> 33:40.978
Should be having way more fun.

33:44.107 --> 33:45.733
I'm trying.

33:51.322 --> 33:53.282
<i>Da, da, da</i>

33:53.282 --> 33:54.992
<i>Uh, da, da, da, uh, uh</i>

33:54.992 --> 33:58.913
<i>Da, da, da, uh, uh</i>

33:58.913 --> 33:59.914
<i>Down, down</i>

34:01.666 --> 34:03.292
Come here.

35:41.682 --> 35:42.892
Joss?

35:44.268 --> 35:45.686
Gotta get up.

35:51.526 --> 35:52.860
<i>How long have you lived here?</i>

35:54.570 --> 35:56.030
Like two years.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.825
Did your mom live here, too?

36:12.922 --> 36:14.173
Okay, look.

36:16.259 --> 36:20.138
I'm not supposed to say things like this,
but I find you so impressive.

36:20.138 --> 36:22.682
The fact that that photo came out

36:22.682 --> 36:25.017
and I can't even imagine
all the shame and humiliation

36:25.017 --> 36:28.229
you must've been feeling,
but it didn't derail you.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.605
The focus that must've taken.

36:29.605 --> 36:32.483
It's like an Olympian.
It's extraordinary.

36:39.866 --> 36:41.784
I'm sorry.
Was there a question?

36:43.911 --> 36:45.121
Did it hurt?

36:46.289 --> 36:48.916
That photo? The betrayal of it?

36:49.542 --> 36:50.710
Of course.

36:50.710 --> 36:52.879
But, I mean, what am I supposed to do?

36:52.879 --> 36:53.880
I don't know.

36:54.589 --> 36:56.382
Fuck up the guy that did it to you.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.009
Like in the piece you're writing?

36:59.051 --> 37:01.471
Yeah, actually.
I think it would be inspirational

37:01.471 --> 37:03.806
for young women and girls
all around the world

37:03.806 --> 37:05.808
who have been targeted and humiliated

37:05.808 --> 37:06.851
in the way you were.

37:06.851 --> 37:08.770
Revenge is empowerment?

37:09.187 --> 37:11.022
It's human, I think.

37:13.608 --> 37:15.735
Look, I think five years ago

37:15.735 --> 37:17.612
when people would tell me
that it was important to comment

37:17.612 --> 37:19.489
on something publicly,
I would buy into it.

37:19.489 --> 37:22.200
But now I just know
that I'm being hustled.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.498
Yeah, I mean, obviously, my editor

37:28.498 --> 37:31.042
is breathing down my neck,
gun to my back,

37:31.042 --> 37:33.920
trying to get me to get you
to talk about this photo.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.463
It's all anyone can talk about.

37:35.922 --> 37:37.340
I get it.

37:42.053 --> 37:44.097
We all have to answer to somebody.

37:45.098 --> 37:46.766
Who do you answer to?

37:54.732 --> 37:55.942
God.

37:59.654 --> 38:02.240
<i>Listen, lady,
we can do this downtown if you want.</i>

38:02.240 --> 38:04.450
<i>So, read me my rights and arrest me.</i>

38:05.284 --> 38:07.245
<i>Otherwise, get the fuck outta here.</i>

38:07.245 --> 38:08.913
Do you like the single?

38:10.289 --> 38:11.499
Yeah!

38:11.958 --> 38:14.210
- Really?
- Joss, it's amazing.

38:14.210 --> 38:15.628
Why?

38:15.628 --> 38:17.713
I don't know. I just feel like--

38:18.923 --> 38:21.717
I know it, like, works commercially,
but I just feel like

38:21.717 --> 38:25.346
every time I listen to it,
I'm, like, fucking embarrassed.

38:25.972 --> 38:29.517
Well, that's because it's different
than anything you've ever done before.

38:29.517 --> 38:33.271
It's, like, edgy but, like, in a cool way.

38:33.271 --> 38:34.605
It's really good.

38:34.605 --> 38:37.900
"Baby, you better have a bank account
if you wanna see what I'm about.

38:37.900 --> 38:40.987
I'm a good girl gone bad.
Get in that car. Drive fast"?

38:41.404 --> 38:42.530
Okay, well

38:43.531 --> 38:47.452
every song sounds weird
when you just talk the lyrics.

38:47.452 --> 38:48.369
Okay?

38:48.369 --> 38:50.872
But also, it's, like

38:51.622 --> 38:53.708
not every song has to be like--

38:53.708 --> 38:55.376
It's fun, you know?

38:55.376 --> 38:57.253
Like, you wanna dance to it

38:57.253 --> 39:00.173
- and, like, vibe.
- Yeah, but I just feel like I've, like--

39:00.798 --> 39:02.508
I don't know.
I haven't done anything in, like, a year.

39:02.508 --> 39:05.595
And I just feel like people are,
like, waiting for me to fail.

39:05.595 --> 39:07.597
And I just don't wanna,
like, prove them right.

39:07.597 --> 39:08.890
Yeah, but, Joss, you always do this.

39:08.890 --> 39:12.477
You always second-guess yourself
right before something comes out.

39:12.477 --> 39:14.645
You're just gonna drive yourself crazy.

39:15.980 --> 39:18.608
I just don't wanna, like,
make a fool of myself.

39:20.109 --> 39:22.111
I don't want people to,
like, make fun of me.

39:22.111 --> 39:23.404
They're not.

39:23.404 --> 39:24.572
Trust me.

39:24.572 --> 39:27.492
It's good. It's, like, really good.

39:30.661 --> 39:32.830
I think I'm gonna invite Tedros over.

39:32.830 --> 39:35.625
The rattail club guy?

39:35.625 --> 39:36.918
Yeah.

39:38.628 --> 39:40.922
- Joss.
- What?

39:40.922 --> 39:45.259
I hate his vibe.

39:45.259 --> 39:47.095
- Really?
- Yes!

39:47.095 --> 39:50.807
- What's wrong with him?
- He's so rape-y.

39:51.224 --> 39:53.434
Yeah, I kinda like that about him.

39:54.018 --> 39:57.855
Joss. No. Gross.

39:58.523 --> 40:00.316
So disturbing.

40:02.985 --> 40:05.196
<i>Yeah, it teaches you to lie.</i>

40:06.531 --> 40:07.949
<i>How's that?</i>

40:08.783 --> 40:10.701
<i>You make stuff up,
it has to be believable.</i>

40:10.701 --> 40:12.995
<i>It's called suspension of disbelief.</i>

40:13.538 --> 40:16.499
- <i>I like that! Suspension of disbelief.</i>
- It's gonna be fine.

40:16.499 --> 40:17.792
Okay?

40:18.876 --> 40:20.294
Trust me.

40:20.920 --> 40:24.132
<i>A detective.
He falls for the wrong woman.</i>

40:24.132 --> 40:25.550
<i>What happens?</i>

40:26.008 --> 40:27.635
<i>She kills him.</i>

40:42.483 --> 40:45.695
<i>Hey, Joss?
Tedros is at the gate.</i>

40:46.612 --> 40:49.615
Okay, just tell him I'm getting ready.
I'll be down in, like, soon.

40:51.451 --> 40:53.035
is that what you're wearing?

40:53.494 --> 40:54.495
Yeah.

40:55.371 --> 40:56.748
With the heels?

40:56.748 --> 40:58.249
I wanna be taller than him.

41:00.251 --> 41:01.252
Okay.

41:01.961 --> 41:03.087
Cool.

41:03.713 --> 41:05.131
I'm just like--

41:06.632 --> 41:08.301
I'm lounging.

41:08.301 --> 41:12.263
I love it. I'll go tell him to wait.

41:12.263 --> 41:14.182
Okay, be mysterious.

41:14.182 --> 41:16.893
- Okay. I'll be very mysterious.
- Okay.

41:37.330 --> 41:38.331
Hi.

41:38.998 --> 41:39.999
Leia?

41:40.458 --> 41:41.375
Yes.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.050
Thank you for that.

41:50.593 --> 41:56.599
Yeah, so Jocelyn is just
finishing getting ready, so.

41:56.599 --> 42:01.396
You can chill in the living room,
have a drink, whatever.

42:02.897 --> 42:04.107
Just make yourself at home.

42:07.026 --> 42:08.403
You sure?

44:26.999 --> 44:28.626
Hello, Angel.

44:30.378 --> 44:32.004
Hello, Angel.

44:36.384 --> 44:38.010
Hello, Angel.

45:10.084 --> 45:13.296
- Hello, Angel.
- You call all the girls Angel?

45:14.130 --> 45:15.381
Just you.

45:16.799 --> 45:18.217
Yeah, right.

45:27.602 --> 45:29.228
We should do a shot.

45:30.980 --> 45:35.068
Number two. Look me in the eyes.
Cheers. Cheers.

45:43.409 --> 45:44.410
Cheers.

45:45.620 --> 45:48.998
Hey, Joss,
you have to be up at 7 A.M. tomorrow.

45:48.998 --> 45:50.374
Okay.

45:55.046 --> 45:56.547
Fuck's up with her?

45:56.923 --> 46:00.051
- She doesn't wanna hang out with us?
- She's my assistant.

46:00.051 --> 46:01.427
And my best friend.

46:01.427 --> 46:02.678
She's your best friend and your assistant?

46:02.678 --> 46:03.596
Yeah.

46:03.596 --> 46:04.555
She's your best friend that works for you?

46:04.555 --> 46:06.432
- Yeah, isn't that nice?
- Really?

46:06.432 --> 46:08.726
Don't you think that's kinda, like,
a nice arrangement?

46:08.726 --> 46:10.770
For her it's amazing.

46:10.770 --> 46:13.439
Fuck. Can I be your best friend?
I'd love to get paid.

46:13.439 --> 46:14.982
Can I play you my new song?

46:14.982 --> 46:16.734
Are you desperate to put
this specific song out?

46:16.734 --> 46:19.112
No, I'm not desperate
to put anything out, my team is.

46:19.112 --> 46:21.781
'Cause everyone in my life is, like,
telling me that it's really great

46:21.781 --> 46:23.783
but I don't believe them.

46:24.283 --> 46:25.201
Why?

46:25.201 --> 46:27.495
'Cause when you're famous,
everyone lies to you.

46:28.121 --> 46:29.414
And you trust me?

46:29.414 --> 46:33.000
I just think you're enough of an asshole
that you might tell me the truth.

46:35.795 --> 46:37.171
Cheers to that.

46:43.136 --> 46:45.430
- You gonna help me?
- Are you gonna go all the way down?

46:45.430 --> 46:47.098
All right, let's go, let's go.

46:47.098 --> 46:49.434
- That's where my studio is.
- Oh, my God.

47:09.245 --> 47:10.830
All right, this is the song
I was telling you about.

47:10.830 --> 47:14.584
It's still super rough.
It's not, like, mixed or anything.

47:16.210 --> 47:18.504
<i>Baby, it's hard to see</i>

47:18.504 --> 47:20.673
<i>When you're lookin' at me</i>

47:20.673 --> 47:22.717
<i>But I do what I want</i>

47:22.717 --> 47:24.927
<i>Don't give a fuck at all</i>

47:24.927 --> 47:27.096
<i>Lookin' for somethin' sweet</i>

47:27.096 --> 47:29.223
<i>When it comes time to eat</i>

47:29.223 --> 47:32.560
<i>You better start to run when I call</i>

47:32.560 --> 47:37.815
<i>'Cause I know that you don't really know
how to handle it</i>

47:40.902 --> 47:43.196
<i>So, get down on your knees</i>

47:43.196 --> 47:46.741
<i>And get ready to become my bitch</i>

47:49.368 --> 47:51.996
<i>I'm just a freak, yeah</i>

47:51.996 --> 47:55.708
<i>You know I want it bad</i>

47:57.960 --> 48:00.129
<i>And we can meet, yeah</i>

48:00.129 --> 48:04.675
<i>But I don't need to know your name</i>

48:06.552 --> 48:10.807
<i>You can pull my hair,
touch me anywhere</i>

48:10.807 --> 48:13.101
<i>Ball and chain</i>

48:15.186 --> 48:21.818
<i>I'm just a freak, yeah,
so show me why you came</i>

48:25.029 --> 48:26.989
<i>Baby, ain't nothin' free</i>

48:26.989 --> 48:29.242
<i>Especially not with me</i>

48:29.242 --> 48:31.119
<i>Better have a bank account</i>

48:31.119 --> 48:33.496
<i>If you wanna see what I'm about</i>

48:33.496 --> 48:36.791
<i>I'm a good girl gone bad</i>

48:38.418 --> 48:41.254
- Why'd you stop it?
- 'Cause it's done.

48:41.754 --> 48:43.631
And you hate it.

48:43.631 --> 48:45.133
I liked it.

48:45.133 --> 48:48.511
- It was good. It's a hit, yeah.
- Really?

48:48.511 --> 48:50.972
I can see why the label
wants to put it out.

48:52.014 --> 48:55.017
I don't know. I feel like it's, like,
too superficial or something.

48:57.353 --> 48:58.354
Why?

48:59.147 --> 49:02.734
Because it's like--
I don't know if it's, like, honest.

49:05.445 --> 49:07.280
So, you're not a freak?

49:07.947 --> 49:10.950
You could release "I'm a Nun" instead.

49:15.371 --> 49:16.998
I'm not a nun.

49:18.040 --> 49:19.667
Are you sure?

49:23.963 --> 49:25.590
I'm positive.

49:32.054 --> 49:35.057
Is this the first song you recorded
after your mother?

49:38.269 --> 49:39.479
Yeah.

49:43.357 --> 49:44.776
Well, I like it.

49:45.526 --> 49:46.944
It's good, yeah.

49:46.944 --> 49:49.363
Just one minor note.

49:49.363 --> 49:51.866
- What's that?
- I don't believe you.

49:53.367 --> 49:55.995
If you're gonna sing a song called
"I'm a Freak,"

49:57.371 --> 49:59.999
you should at least sing it
like you know how to fuck.

50:02.251 --> 50:04.420
What makes you think
I don't know how to fuck?

50:05.296 --> 50:06.923
Your vocal performance.

50:09.092 --> 50:10.259
Fuck you.

50:11.052 --> 50:12.261
Fuck you.

50:13.012 --> 50:15.681
Do you ever listen to Donna Summer?
"Love to Love You Baby"?

50:17.433 --> 50:18.851
When she sings

50:20.603 --> 50:23.606
there's no doubt that
she knows how to fuck.

50:24.941 --> 50:25.942
Yeah.

50:29.695 --> 50:31.906
You could hear it in her voice.

50:36.327 --> 50:37.745
You can feel it.

50:39.622 --> 50:41.040
But not with me?

50:44.252 --> 50:45.461
Not yet.

50:53.511 --> 50:54.971
You sing sitting down?

50:56.180 --> 50:57.265
I do.

50:58.141 --> 50:59.142
Get up.

51:15.032 --> 51:17.452
You gotta stop carin' what people think.

51:20.413 --> 51:21.622
You are...

51:23.207 --> 51:24.208
too...

51:25.877 --> 51:27.712
locked up in your head.

51:29.005 --> 51:31.841
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you're thinking too much.

51:33.634 --> 51:35.595
You need to block out the world.

51:38.890 --> 51:40.308
Feel it.

51:46.314 --> 51:47.523
Do you trust me?

51:49.567 --> 51:50.568
No.

52:27.188 --> 52:28.606
Don't be scared.

52:34.529 --> 52:36.155
Open your mouth.

52:37.323 --> 52:38.950
Open your mouth.

52:51.712 --> 52:53.339
Now you can sing.

52:58.511 --> 53:04.225
<i>Oh, Nikki, ohhhh</i>

53:05.435 --> 53:07.145
<i>Ohh</i>

53:10.189 --> 53:13.443
<i>Come back, Nikki, come back</i>

53:13.443 --> 53:16.154
<i>Your dirty little Prince wanna grind</i>

53:16.154 --> 53:20.867
<i>Grind, grind, grind, grind,
grind, grind, grind, grind</i>
