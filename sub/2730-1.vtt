05:14.333 --> 05:16.794
I thought you'd never get back.

05:17.044 --> 05:19.380
There was a heck of a crowd on the piste.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.882
So I see.

05:22.132 --> 05:26.387
- Mission accomplished?
- Best beluga.

05:26.637 --> 05:31.433
Vodka - rather shaken -
and one microchip.

05:31.684 --> 05:36.563
Good. I'll make a signal to M.

05:39.775 --> 05:45.656
Be a good girl, would you,
and put her on automatic.

05:47.783 --> 05:51.495
And we could do with a couple of glasses.

05:51.745 --> 05:56.625
They're in the overhead rack.

05:58.919 --> 06:00.671
Commander Bond...!

06:00.921 --> 06:05.843
Call me James. It's five days to Alaska.

09:51.402 --> 09:55.572
- Thank goodness you're here, James.
- That's very nice, Moneypenny.

09:55.823 --> 09:57.658
A little over the top for the office?

09:57.908 --> 10:01.704
I've been trying to reach you all morning.
What have you been up to?

10:01.954 --> 10:04.498
Rest and recreation, my darling.

10:04.748 --> 10:07.876
The trip back from Siberia
took a lot out of me.

10:08.127 --> 10:11.797
Your dedication when you're on the job
is most commendable, James.

10:12.047 --> 10:16.260
<i>Omit the customary pleasantries, Miss
Moneypenny. We're pressed for time.</i>

10:16.510 --> 10:20.514
I'll fill you in later, Moneypenny.

10:29.023 --> 10:30.482
- Minister.
- Commander.

10:30.733 --> 10:33.235
Good morning, sir.

10:33.485 --> 10:34.945
A new pet, Q?

10:35.195 --> 10:39.450
If, 007, you'd ever bothered to read
any memos sent from my department,

10:39.700 --> 10:44.288
you would realise this is a prototype
of a sophisticated surveillance machine.

10:44.538 --> 10:46.957
Now we're all here
you can get on with the briefing, Q.

10:47.207 --> 10:50.794
Very good, sir.

10:50.836 --> 10:53.005
Gentlemen...

10:53.255 --> 10:56.717
A silicon integrated circuit:

10:56.967 --> 10:59.303
The essential part
of all modern computers.

10:59.553 --> 11:02.848
No lecture, Q.
We're all aware of the microchip.

11:03.098 --> 11:07.686
Until recently, all microchips
were susceptible to damage

11:07.937 --> 11:11.690
from the intense magnetic pulse
of a nuclear explosion.

11:11.941 --> 11:14.068
- Magnetic pulse?
- Yes, Minister.

11:14.318 --> 11:18.322
One burst in outer space over the UK
and everything with a microchip in it,

11:18.572 --> 11:22.785
from the modern toaster to sophisticated
computers and our defence systems,

11:23.035 --> 11:25.329
would be rendered useless.

11:25.579 --> 11:27.790
We'd be paralysed -
at the Russians' mercy.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.669
That is why a private defence
contractor came up with this:

11:31.919 --> 11:36.173
A chip totally impervious
to magnetic pulse damage.

11:36.423 --> 11:39.760
Now - if I place it on the micro-comparator

11:40.010 --> 11:42.513
and compare it with
the chip Bond recovered

11:42.763 --> 11:48.227
from the body of 003 in Siberia...

11:49.228 --> 11:53.315
- When I bring the two images together...
- They're identical.

11:53.565 --> 11:56.902
The KGB must have a pipeline
into that research company.

11:57.152 --> 11:58.612
It would appear so.

11:58.862 --> 12:02.950
Six months ago that company was
acquired by an Anglo-French combine:

12:03.200 --> 12:05.202
Zorin Industries.

12:05.452 --> 12:08.706
There has been a security
check of the plant?

12:08.956 --> 12:11.750
A very extensive one.
But we have no leads.

12:12.001 --> 12:13.627
What about Zorin himself?

12:13.877 --> 12:17.548
Max Zorin? Impossible.
He's a leading French industrialist.

12:17.798 --> 12:21.802
A staunch anti-communist with
influential friends in the government.

12:22.052 --> 12:24.013
With due respect, Minister,

12:24.263 --> 12:26.974
the leak did occur
after Zorin bought the company.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.685
Precisely why
I've initiated an investigation.

12:29.935 --> 12:32.688
All right, but let's be discreet about it.

12:32.938 --> 12:36.609
But of course, Minister.

12:37.192 --> 12:43.490
You have exactly 35 minutes
to get properly dressed, 007.

12:43.741 --> 12:50.372
<i>They round the turn.
Just under a mile to race from this point.</i>

12:51.707 --> 12:54.627
Come on, Fluke! Move your ar...

12:54.877 --> 13:00.507
- Who is number one? The grey with him?
- Oh, that's Pegasus. Zorin's horse.

13:00.758 --> 13:02.301
With the cane. Max Zorin?

13:02.551 --> 13:06.931
Yes. Born in Dresden.
Fled from East Germany in the sixties.

13:07.181 --> 13:10.851
French passport.
Speaks at least five languages, no accent.

13:11.101 --> 13:14.104
Now the talk of the City and the Bourse.

13:14.355 --> 13:18.567
- The old rags-to-riches story.
- Made his first fortune in oil and gas.

13:18.817 --> 13:21.153
Now a second in electronics and hi-tech.

13:21.403 --> 13:27.451
Who's that with him under the hat?
With the red dress. A girlfriend?

13:27.618 --> 13:29.912
We're not sure about her.

13:30.162 --> 13:36.001
American. She's never far from him.
Name's May Day.

13:36.251 --> 13:39.880
And dressed for the occasion.

13:40.130 --> 13:44.510
Come on, Fluke! Get a wiggle on!

13:46.262 --> 13:50.266
<i>Pegasus has come from nowhere,
and as they go for the line</i>

13:50.516 --> 13:57.106
<i>it's Pegasus who storms clear
off Fluke and Cooper Girl.</i>

14:00.025 --> 14:04.989
<i>First, number one; second, number two;
and third, number five.</i>

14:05.239 --> 14:08.826
<i>First number one, Pegasus;
second number two, Fluke;</i>

14:09.076 --> 14:13.914
<i>and third number five, Cooper Girl.</i>

14:19.586 --> 14:22.673
Unbelievable! In all my years as a trainer

14:22.923 --> 14:25.718
I've never seen a horse
run such a fast last furlong.

14:25.968 --> 14:30.598
Sir Godfrey Tibbett. Our department.

14:30.806 --> 14:35.519
- Many congratulations.
- Thank you.

14:35.728 --> 14:39.315
- Lucky man, Zorin.
- Could be more than luck, Admiral.

14:39.565 --> 14:42.568
- Fixed?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

14:42.818 --> 14:48.616
The French Jockey Club have hired
a detective, Aubergine, to look into it.

14:48.866 --> 14:51.827
Easy, Pegasus.

14:52.077 --> 14:55.539
Calm down, Pegasus.

14:55.581 --> 14:57.875
Steady.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.753
She must take a lot of vitamins.

15:01.003 --> 15:04.798
Perhaps Pegasus does too.

15:05.132 --> 15:08.302
I think I should meet with
this detective friend of yours.

15:08.552 --> 15:13.098
Yes. Might have some interesting
information for us. Set it up, Tibbett.

15:13.349 --> 15:14.642
Right you are.

15:14.892 --> 15:18.020
Moneypenny - be a darling, would you,
and collect that for me.

15:18.270 --> 15:22.650
- I'll buy you dinner when we get back.
- Pegasus!

15:41.043 --> 15:42.753
Bollinger, '75.

15:43.003 --> 15:46.048
I see you are a connoisseur,
Monsieur Bond.

15:46.298 --> 15:50.511
<i>- Ensuite, Lafite Rothschild '59.
- Another excellent choice.</i>

15:50.761 --> 15:55.224
I'm pleased you approve -
since you're paying the bill.

15:55.474 --> 15:58.477
<i>- Cheers.
- Santé, Monsieur Aubergine.</i>

15:58.727 --> 16:03.524
The Sùreté has no information on Zorin
before he came over from East Germany?

16:03.774 --> 16:07.152
Through a personal connection
I saw his dossier myself.

16:07.403 --> 16:13.367
But even Sùreté records
are sometimes incomplete!

16:14.660 --> 16:22.626
"Et voici maintenant" the fabulous
Dominique and the enchanted "papillons"!

16:52.364 --> 16:58.329
Perhaps we should add this
butterfly to our collection, no?

16:58.579 --> 17:03.500
Tell me, why do Zorin's horses
beat others with superior bloodlines?

17:03.751 --> 17:05.586
This is a mystery.

17:05.836 --> 17:12.343
- Could he be using drugs?
- Nothing showed up in the tests.

17:15.971 --> 17:21.727
Later this month, Zorin will hold his
annual sales at his stud near Paris.

17:21.977 --> 17:27.942
Security is formidable
but the key to this mystery is there.

17:28.192 --> 17:33.864
And I, Achille Aubergine,
intend to find it.

17:40.245 --> 17:45.501
<i>- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
- There's a fly in his soup.</i>

19:33.233 --> 19:35.778
- Follow that parachute.
- Crazy English!

19:36.028 --> 19:39.823
Out.

19:47.957 --> 19:51.710
My car!

19:55.631 --> 19:59.635
My car!

21:02.865 --> 21:06.452
Congratulations.

21:20.507 --> 21:24.094
So?

21:30.434 --> 21:33.771
This operation was to be
conducted discreetly.

21:34.021 --> 21:37.107
It took six million francs
in damages and penalties

21:37.358 --> 21:39.443
for violating most of the Napoleonic Code.

21:39.693 --> 21:43.989
Under the circumstances it was
more important to identify the assassin.

21:44.239 --> 21:47.284
What did you learn from Aubergine
before his demise?

21:47.534 --> 21:51.872
Only that Zorin is having a thoroughbred
sale at his stud not far from here.

21:52.122 --> 21:53.582
I should be there.

21:53.832 --> 21:57.670
- Can you help me, Sir Godfrey?
- I may be able to arrange an invitation.

21:57.920 --> 22:01.674
It's a bit short notice...
but I might just be able to squeeze you in.

22:01.924 --> 22:04.385
Thank you.

22:13.560 --> 22:17.147
Sir Godfrey, your hat.

22:27.449 --> 22:30.202
Mr Saint John Smith?

22:30.452 --> 22:31.996
St John Smythe, my dear.

22:32.246 --> 22:35.958
- My name is Scarpine. Head of security.
- How do you do.

22:36.208 --> 22:39.962
- We have a room for you at the chateau.
- Oh, splendid.

22:40.212 --> 22:43.549
By the way, the preview is in progress
at the main stables.

22:43.799 --> 22:46.885
- Is that it?
- No, no, those are the servants' quarters.

22:47.136 --> 22:49.930
The stables are over here.

22:50.180 --> 22:53.767
Let me escort you there.

23:07.615 --> 23:10.826
- Catalogue of the sales.
- Thank you.

23:11.076 --> 23:14.580
Tell me - the lthacus colt. Is it here?

23:14.830 --> 23:17.374
- You mean the full brother of Pegasus?
- Yes.

23:17.625 --> 23:20.377
He's the outstanding horse of the sales.

23:20.628 --> 23:25.257
He'll be shown last. We expect him
to fetch over three million dollars.

23:25.507 --> 23:28.844
Sounds quite reasonable.

23:29.094 --> 23:31.889
If you need any further assistance
please call me.

23:32.139 --> 23:35.726
Thank you.

23:42.399 --> 23:46.612
Steady! Steady, Pegasus.

23:49.823 --> 23:53.410
Keep him on a tight rein!

23:57.623 --> 24:01.961
Steady now, Pegasus.

24:15.683 --> 24:21.689
<i>We are now very proud to present
the full brother of Pegasus.</i>

24:21.939 --> 24:25.776
<i>This colt is born in the purple.</i>

25:00.227 --> 25:02.229
Monsieur Smythe.

25:02.479 --> 25:04.481
Monsieur Zorin has been detained.

25:04.732 --> 25:08.819
He's anxious to meet you at the
reception in the chateau gardens later.

25:09.069 --> 25:10.446
I look forward to it.

25:10.696 --> 25:14.450
- I wish you wouldn't keep wandering off.
- I'm sorry, sir.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.910
Your driver may stay
in the servants' quarters.

25:17.161 --> 25:24.293
I'm sure that'll be more than adequate.
What do you say, Tibbett?

25:47.066 --> 25:50.819
- Welcome, sir. I'm Jenny Flex.
- Of course you are.

25:51.070 --> 25:55.282
- I'll call a porter.
- Oh, no need. My man'll take care of it.

25:55.532 --> 25:59.453
- Let me show you to your room.
- Thank you.

25:59.703 --> 26:03.248
When you're ready, Tibbett.

26:06.043 --> 26:09.213
Well, my dear, I take it you spend
a lot of time in the saddle.

26:09.463 --> 26:15.010
- Yes, I love an early morning ride.
- I'm an early riser myself.

26:15.261 --> 26:20.057
Come along, Tibbett. Stop wheezing.

26:40.202 --> 26:43.038
Don't stand there panting, Tibbett.
Start unpacking.

26:43.289 --> 26:46.959
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

26:49.586 --> 26:55.050
- The reception is at six.
- Thank you, my dear.

26:55.926 --> 26:59.555
Well, you heard what Miss Jenny Flex
said: There is a reception at six.

26:59.805 --> 27:03.475
- Yes, sir.
- So I need a white jacket and a black tie.

27:03.726 --> 27:05.144
Yes, sir.

27:05.394 --> 27:08.522
- And if possible, a clean shirt.
- Yes, sir.

27:08.772 --> 27:12.276
Oh, my Lord, Tibbett!
Look at the state of my clothes.

27:12.526 --> 27:17.823
- How on earth do you pack my bags?
- Sorry, sir.

27:21.327 --> 27:24.955
Mr Faras told his trainer
he'll go to a million for the lthacus colt.

27:25.205 --> 27:28.500
- Good. Anything from St John Smythe?
- Nothing about the sale, sir.

27:28.751 --> 27:32.546
<i>- But I'd hate to be his valet.
- You'll have to buck up your ideas.</i>

27:32.796 --> 27:37.384
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't be so damned obsequious.

27:41.847 --> 27:45.059
<i>Oh, my Lord.
What the devil's wrong with these shoes?</i>

27:45.309 --> 27:49.355
<i>- Were they wiped over with an oily rag?
- Terribly sorry, sir.</i>

27:49.605 --> 27:51.273
<i>You blasted well should be.</i>

27:51.523 --> 27:56.695
<i>I don't know how long
you expect to remain in my employ...</i>

27:56.946 --> 28:02.242
- Well done, my good man.
- Must we keep this up when we're alone?

28:02.493 --> 28:06.497
A successful cover becomes
almost second nature.

28:06.747 --> 28:09.375
What's all this about
Pegasus disappearing?

28:09.625 --> 28:13.045
One minute he's in his stall -
the next, neither hide nor hair of him.

28:13.295 --> 28:14.880
We should look into it.

28:15.130 --> 28:20.469
Well, don't you concern yourself with that.

28:29.228 --> 28:34.358
There's the man I saw
at the Pegasus stable

28:52.459 --> 28:56.171
- Another wealthy owner?
- Who knows?

28:56.422 --> 29:00.718
- But she'd bear closer inspection.
- We're on a mission.

29:00.968 --> 29:06.682
Sir Godfrey, on a mission
I am expected to sacrifice myself.

29:52.311 --> 29:56.315
Lovely party.

30:14.124 --> 30:18.045
Enjoying our little party,
Monsieur... Saint John Smythe?

30:18.295 --> 30:20.714
Immensely. St John Smythe.

30:20.965 --> 30:27.596
Looks as though you'll have
a good turnout for the sale tomorrow.

30:49.952 --> 30:55.582
May I introduce Miss Sutton?
Sheikh Farouk.

31:32.786 --> 31:36.915
- Welcome.
- Mr Zorin. Main Strike all set?

31:37.166 --> 31:40.961
We'll know after the 22nd.

31:42.421 --> 31:45.716
- Thank you.
- Enjoy yourself.

31:52.306 --> 31:54.475
You were looking for something?

31:54.725 --> 31:57.394
Yes, I... was looking for the bar.

31:57.645 --> 32:01.774
Come. I will show you.

32:05.653 --> 32:09.657
Oh, by the way, the name is
St John Smythe. James St John Smythe.

32:09.907 --> 32:12.826
Dr Carl Mortner. At your service.

32:13.077 --> 32:17.164
- Hiya, doc!
- Good afternoon, Mr Conley.

32:17.414 --> 32:20.334
Mr Conley, Mr Smythe.

32:20.584 --> 32:22.753
Bob Conley.

32:23.003 --> 32:26.715
- Are you a trainer?
- Horses? Hell, I can't even ride.

32:26.966 --> 32:29.718
- I'm in the oil business.
- Oh. Texas?

32:29.969 --> 32:33.681
Frisco. I handle Mr Zorin's
oil interests there.

32:33.931 --> 32:38.018
Would you excuse us? Come on, honey.

32:38.269 --> 32:39.979
Are you a doctor of medicine?

32:40.229 --> 32:45.317
Oh, no, no.
I am Mr Zorin's breeding consultant.

32:45.567 --> 32:48.320
Oh, really?
Then you can let me into a little secret.

32:48.570 --> 32:54.368
How is it you succeed with breeding
bloodlines other experts think inferior?

32:54.618 --> 32:56.954
Selective breeding is important.

32:57.204 --> 33:02.209
But more important
is conditioning and a desire, "ja"?

33:02.459 --> 33:06.672
Are you talking about people or horses?

33:06.797 --> 33:09.008
My principles apply equally
to human beings.

33:09.258 --> 33:11.969
Mr St John Smythe.
Allow me to introduce myself.

33:12.219 --> 33:13.762
Mr Zorin, it's a great pleasure.

33:14.013 --> 33:17.725
- A groom asked if you'd go to the stables.
- Of course.

33:17.975 --> 33:21.562
You will excuse me?

33:21.687 --> 33:25.316
I must congratulate you, Mr Zorin.
Your stables are magnificent.

33:25.566 --> 33:29.862
Built in the 16th century by a duke who
believed he'd be reincarnated as a horse.

33:30.112 --> 33:31.989
Have thoroughbreds interested you long?

33:32.239 --> 33:37.494
Oh, no. As a matter of fact I had a dotty
old aunt die and leave me some stables.

33:37.745 --> 33:41.123
So I thought it might be rather fun
to breed and raise horses.

33:41.373 --> 33:46.211
- I take it you ride?
- I'm happiest in the saddle.

33:46.462 --> 33:48.756
A fellow-sportsman.

33:49.006 --> 33:51.759
What about fishing?

33:52.009 --> 33:55.137
Fly casting?

33:55.387 --> 34:00.601
I'm neglecting my other guests. You'll find
the young ladies stimulating company.

34:00.851 --> 34:04.438
I'm sure they are.

34:15.449 --> 34:20.036
Hello. I thought you might
like to join the party.

34:20.286 --> 34:26.627
By the way, the name is
James St John Smythe. I'm English.

34:26.877 --> 34:31.590
- I never would have guessed.
- Really?

34:33.384 --> 34:36.844
Well, are you buying or selling?

34:37.096 --> 34:41.100
- Selling?!
- Horses.

34:41.558 --> 34:45.187
No, I'm not interested in horses.

34:45.437 --> 34:48.983
Well, you came to the wrong place,
didn't you?

34:49.233 --> 34:52.820
May Day.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.822
Get her away from him.

34:56.072 --> 35:00.536
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.

35:00.786 --> 35:03.247
Have Security keep a good eye on him.

35:03.497 --> 35:07.293
You didn't say what part
of the States you come from, Miss...

35:07.543 --> 35:09.920
No. I didn't.

35:10.170 --> 35:11.797
I suppose you travel a lot?

35:12.047 --> 35:14.592
Your helicopter leaves in 20 minutes.

35:14.842 --> 35:19.263
You're not staying the night? I was hoping
we'd spend the evening together.

35:19.513 --> 35:21.682
Now I shall be all alone.

35:21.932 --> 35:24.560
I doubt that.

35:24.810 --> 35:28.480
- Well, let me walk you to the chopper.
- That won't be necessary.

35:28.731 --> 35:36.572
- Someone will take care of you.
- You'll see to that personally, will you?

36:51.313 --> 36:54.275
Are you looking for this?

36:54.525 --> 36:58.112
Quite a letdown.

37:38.902 --> 37:43.574
- St John Smythe?
- Sleeping like a baby.

38:07.640 --> 38:12.186
That's a boy. There we are.

38:25.282 --> 38:29.960
It's interesting. He's had surgery.

38:29.995 --> 38:34.458
Surgery? That is how Zorin won the race.

38:34.708 --> 38:38.254
Mortner implanted one of
these microchips into Pegasus.

38:38.504 --> 38:42.800
You see, these microchips are
programmed to control an injection

38:43.050 --> 38:45.803
of additional natural horse steroids.

38:46.053 --> 38:49.431
- To overcome fatigue during the race.
- How?

38:49.682 --> 38:52.851
The injection itself,
with that small needle,

38:53.102 --> 38:56.355
is triggered by
a remote-control transmitter

38:56.605 --> 39:00.567
small enough to fit into
the tip of a jockey's whip -

39:00.818 --> 39:03.153
or a cane.

39:03.404 --> 39:06.448
The lights!

39:40.232 --> 39:47.448
There's a world surplus of microchips
and Zorin is hoarding them!

40:34.203 --> 40:39.750
- I'm afraid I wasn't much help.
- Don't worry. It's all wrapped up.

40:58.644 --> 41:04.608
Keep your guard up higher.
And retain your balance.

41:51.572 --> 41:53.907
- What now?
- We'd better get back.

41:54.158 --> 41:57.953
The tape ran out five minutes ago.

42:09.006 --> 42:10.716
I told you not to disturb us.

42:10.966 --> 42:14.345
<i>It's important.
There's been intruders in the warehouse.</i>

42:14.595 --> 42:18.474
Put Security on full alert.

42:18.682 --> 42:22.728
Let's see where Mr St John Smythe is.

42:58.013 --> 43:01.558
"He" was the man at the Eiffel Tower.

43:01.809 --> 43:06.522
- We must find him.
- I'll get dressed.

43:13.529 --> 43:18.117
May Day, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

43:18.367 --> 43:23.497
To take care of me personally.

43:35.718 --> 43:40.556
I see you're a woman of very few words.

43:41.974 --> 43:45.561
What's there to say?

44:04.997 --> 44:07.875
<i>- Is everything here?
- Ja, ja.</i>

44:08.125 --> 44:10.753
Except this.

44:11.003 --> 44:13.255
It is in the wrong place.

44:13.505 --> 44:20.095
Bring St John Smythe to my study
first thing in the morning.

44:27.227 --> 44:29.897
Good morning.

44:30.147 --> 44:33.067
I understand you wish to see me.

44:33.317 --> 44:38.656
- You slept well?
- A little restless, but I got off eventually.

44:38.906 --> 44:41.575
I have the Progeny Index
on the computer:

44:41.825 --> 44:44.161
A compilation of thoroughbred bloodlines.

44:44.411 --> 44:49.875
Might be helpful to you in selecting
your purchase this afternoon.

44:50.125 --> 44:53.337
As I see it, you need a stallion.
For breeding.

44:53.587 --> 44:56.799
A stallion sounds right to me.

44:57.049 --> 45:01.262
I find a computer indispensable.

45:05.641 --> 45:10.854
I have a stallion.
Descended from that horse there.

45:11.105 --> 45:14.692
Misty.

45:23.075 --> 45:26.704
We have several horses
that might interest you.

45:26.954 --> 45:29.123
Splendid.

45:34.003 --> 45:37.798
Would you be interested
primarily in stamina?

45:38.048 --> 45:43.679
- Or speed?
- Well, a little of both would be ideal.

45:46.307 --> 45:50.603
I think I have just the horse for you.

45:50.978 --> 45:53.314
It's time for my morning ride.

45:53.564 --> 45:57.693
- Why don't you try him out?
- That sounds a very good idea.

45:57.943 --> 46:00.571
- I shall get into some riding clothes.
- Good.

46:00.821 --> 46:03.324
Half an hour, then.
Scarpine will collect you.

46:03.574 --> 46:07.161
Thank you.

46:13.959 --> 46:17.880
Tibbett, get into town, call M
and ask him to put a trace on this cheque.

46:18.130 --> 46:22.051
Be quick. If those guards we laid out
identify us we'll have to move fast.

46:22.301 --> 46:24.887
What shall I say
if they ask where I'm going?

46:25.137 --> 46:30.476
Just tell them
you have to get the car washed.

46:52.081 --> 46:57.002
Just going to town to get the car washed.

47:19.149 --> 47:25.114
- Your mount, Mr St John Smythe.
- A beautiful beast.

47:25.531 --> 47:28.909
A little spirited. What's his name?

47:29.159 --> 47:32.746
Inferno.

48:59.208 --> 49:01.961
- Friends of yours?
- Exercise boys.

49:02.211 --> 49:06.173
Jumping together
is more realistic training.

49:06.423 --> 49:09.134
Frankly, I prefer cross-country
to steeplechase.

49:09.385 --> 49:13.138
As one sportsman to another,
I'll make you a proposition.

49:13.389 --> 49:18.894
You can have that lthacus colt gratis
if you stay this course.

49:19.144 --> 49:23.315
- And if I'm thrown?
- Then you lose.

49:24.066 --> 49:27.569
You leave me little choice.

49:27.820 --> 49:32.241
Splendid. Scarpine will start us.

50:45.314 --> 50:48.275
Steady!

51:13.092 --> 51:16.679
Keep going!

51:16.971 --> 51:20.766
Sir Godfrey. Let's get...

51:37.116 --> 51:39.910
You lost, 007.

51:40.160 --> 51:44.456
- Killing Tibbett was a mistake.
- I'm about to make the same one twice.

51:44.707 --> 51:47.585
My department know I'm here.
They'll retaliate.

51:47.835 --> 51:49.837
If you're the best they have,

51:50.087 --> 51:53.257
they'll more likely try
to cover up your incompetence.

51:53.507 --> 51:55.634
Don't count on it, Zorin.

51:55.884 --> 52:00.222
- You amuse me, Mr Bond.
- Well, it's not mutual.

52:00.472 --> 52:04.059
Other side.

52:06.979 --> 52:10.566
Open up.

54:27.411 --> 54:30.706
- Good morning, Comrade Zorin.
- General Gogol.

54:30.956 --> 54:34.335
- This meeting is ill-advised.
- A calculated risk.

54:34.585 --> 54:37.087
But necessary,
as you refuse to answer your control.

54:37.338 --> 54:39.506
Come to the point, General.

54:39.757 --> 54:41.759
You disregard procedure.

54:42.009 --> 54:46.388
You did not request approval
before eliminating 007.

54:46.639 --> 54:53.228
- Reprisals might jeopardise operations.
- You jeopardise mine!

54:53.479 --> 54:56.148
Letting the British penetrate
the Siberian research centre.

54:56.398 --> 54:57.733
That was regrettable.

54:57.983 --> 55:01.904
Your racing activities
attract unnecessary attention,

55:02.154 --> 55:06.700
but more disturbing are your
unauthorised commercial ventures.

55:06.951 --> 55:08.869
We cannot tolerate that.

55:09.119 --> 55:12.456
The issue is irrelevant.
I've made new associations.

55:12.706 --> 55:14.833
I no longer consider myself a KGB agent.

55:15.084 --> 55:19.004
We trained you. Financed you.

55:19.255 --> 55:26.845
What would you be without us?
A biological experiment. A freak.

55:32.434 --> 55:37.147
Enough of this! Control yourselves.

55:41.277 --> 55:48.701
You will come back to us, Comrade.
No one ever leaves the KGB.

55:50.452 --> 55:51.120
Gentlemen.

55:51.370 --> 55:57.042
For centuries alchemists
tried to make gold from base metals.

55:57.293 --> 56:02.965
Today we make microchips from silicon,
which is common sand.

56:03.215 --> 56:06.260
But far better than gold.

56:06.510 --> 56:09.179
For several years we've had
a profitable partnership:

56:09.430 --> 56:15.060
You as manufacturers, while I passed on
to you industrial information

56:15.311 --> 56:20.566
that made you competitive, successful.

56:21.525 --> 56:27.531
We are now in the unique position
to form an international cartel

56:27.781 --> 56:35.623
to control not only production
but distribution of these microchips.

56:35.658 --> 56:39.209
There is one obstacle.

56:50.012 --> 56:51.931
Silicon Valley.

56:52.181 --> 56:54.224
Near San Francisco.

56:54.475 --> 56:59.355
Over 250 plants employing
thousands of scientists, technicians.

56:59.605 --> 57:03.067
This is the heartland of electronic
production in the United States,

57:03.317 --> 57:08.155
which accounts for what -
80% of the world microchip market.

57:08.405 --> 57:11.992
I propose to end

57:12.409 --> 57:16.664
the domination of Silicon Valley.

57:16.914 --> 57:21.043
- And to leave us in control of that market.
- What is it you propose?

57:21.293 --> 57:24.505
Project Main Strike.

57:24.755 --> 57:28.801
For which, each of you will pay me
one hundred million dollars.

57:29.051 --> 57:31.553
A hundred million dollars?!

57:31.804 --> 57:35.516
Plus half our net income?

57:35.766 --> 57:38.811
Under an exclusive
marketing agreement with me.

57:39.061 --> 57:40.729
These are outrageous terms!

57:40.980 --> 57:44.066
Perhaps a demonstration
would convince you.

57:44.316 --> 57:49.029
- I want no part of it, thank you.
- As you wish.

57:50.114 --> 57:53.242
The rest of our discussion
must of course be confidential.

57:53.492 --> 57:57.830
- Would you wait outside?
- If you'd like me to, yes. Excuse me.

57:58.080 --> 58:02.793
May Day will provide you with a drink.

58:06.505 --> 58:10.092
This way.

58:35.326 --> 58:39.163
So, does anybody else want to drop out?

58:48.339 --> 58:51.926
Wow!

58:52.051 --> 58:53.719
What a view!

58:53.969 --> 58:57.973
To a kill.

59:27.670 --> 59:29.380
Five dollars.

59:29.630 --> 59:33.217
Thank you.

59:34.885 --> 59:40.057
- Looking for something special?
- Yes. Soft-shell crabs.

59:40.307 --> 59:43.102
Might have some in the back.

59:43.352 --> 59:46.897
I'll be a few minutes.

59:53.237 --> 59:56.991
Chuck Lee, CIA.
It's a pleasure working with 007.

59:57.241 --> 01:00:00.995
- Thanks. Now what about Zorin?
- He's in town. I can have him tailed.

01:00:01.245 --> 01:00:03.372
No, not yet.

01:00:03.622 --> 01:00:08.294
Conley is a geologist. Runs Zorin's
oil reclamation project in the East Bay.

01:00:08.544 --> 01:00:11.630
Last job: Chief engineer
in a South African gold mine.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.758
Left in a hurry
after a cave-in killed 20 miners.

01:00:15.009 --> 01:00:18.178
Zorin's kind of man!
What about the girl? And the cheque?

01:00:18.429 --> 01:00:20.598
You know how many S Suttons
there are in the US?

01:00:20.848 --> 01:00:23.976
We watch Zorin's account.
The cheque hasn't been cashed.

01:00:24.226 --> 01:00:26.854
- Mortner?
- Got a real winner here.

01:00:27.104 --> 01:00:32.318
His real name is Hans Glaub, a German
pioneer in the development of steroids.

01:00:32.568 --> 01:00:35.362
That ties in with the horse injections.

01:00:35.613 --> 01:00:40.409
In World War II he used steroids on
pregnant women in concentration camps

01:00:40.659 --> 01:00:43.162
in an attempt to enhance intelligence.

01:00:43.412 --> 01:00:46.582
- With any success?
- Virtually every mother aborted.

01:00:46.832 --> 01:00:49.668
A handful of children
were produced with phenomenal IQs.

01:00:49.919 --> 01:00:52.755
But there was a side-effect:
They were psychotics.

01:00:53.005 --> 01:00:56.592
Why wasn't this Mortner or Glaub
tried by the War Crimes Commission?

01:00:56.842 --> 01:00:59.219
The Russians grabbed him.
Set him up in a laboratory.

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:04.850
He spent years developing steroids for
their athletes, then vanished 15 years ago.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.519
About the same time
Zorin came over to the West.

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:11.941
Could Zorin be one of the steroid kids?

01:01:12.191 --> 01:01:16.111
He's definitely the right age,
and he's certainly psychotic.

01:01:16.362 --> 01:01:19.031
What about his oil operations?

01:01:19.281 --> 01:01:22.159
- Mr O'Rourke!
- Aye!

01:01:22.409 --> 01:01:26.163
- Can you spare a minute?
- Sure thing.

01:01:26.413 --> 01:01:31.627
The oil operation looks clean, except
for a problem with the crab fishermen.

01:01:31.877 --> 01:01:34.713
Good morning.
Here's that reporter I told you about.

01:01:34.964 --> 01:01:37.549
Mr O'Rourke.
I understand you have a problem.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.929
That Zorin oil pumping station ruined
one of the best crab patches in the Bay.

01:01:42.179 --> 01:01:43.430
Scared them away?

01:01:43.681 --> 01:01:48.143
They didn't go nowhere.
They just disappeared.

01:01:48.394 --> 01:01:51.605
Well, I'd like to look at
that oil pumping station.

01:01:51.855 --> 01:01:57.152
That'll be tough. It's very heavily guarded.

01:02:16.964 --> 01:02:20.342
We'll be testing new equipment shortly.
Keep a sharp lookout.

01:02:20.593 --> 01:02:24.305
- I don't want anyone near this dock.
- Very good, sir.

01:02:24.555 --> 01:02:27.975
- Valves 5 to 15 are open.
- What's the report from the wells?

01:02:28.225 --> 01:02:31.604
<i>Wells report valves open
and ready to receive water.</i>

01:02:31.854 --> 01:02:34.732
<i>Good. Open valves 16 to 25.</i>

01:02:34.982 --> 01:02:37.276
<i>Valve 10 at half capacity, sir.</i>

01:02:37.526 --> 01:02:41.155
<i>Give me an update on valve procedure
for the Main Strike programme.</i>

01:02:41.405 --> 01:02:47.077
<i>We'll have a field crew
check it out in the morning.</i>

01:03:11.852 --> 01:03:14.813
- Valves to wells 26 to 30 open, sir.
- Right.

01:03:15.064 --> 01:03:17.691
Activate pumping procedure.
50 per cent power.

01:03:17.942 --> 01:03:19.944
Increase it.

01:03:20.194 --> 01:03:22.071
Maximum.

01:03:22.321 --> 01:03:24.031
The new seals are not fully tested.

01:03:24.281 --> 01:03:28.160
Main Strike's in three days. Any delays...

01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:30.412
I hold you responsible.

01:03:30.663 --> 01:03:35.542
- Yes, sir.
- Bring it up to full. Slowly.

01:04:27.052 --> 01:04:32.975
- Shut down! The propeller's jammed.
- Fix it.

01:04:50.117 --> 01:04:54.622
You there! Get a man down there!

01:04:58.083 --> 01:05:00.544
Let's go, move. Come on, you guys.
Gimme a hand.

01:05:00.794 --> 01:05:04.256
- Get the alarms turned off.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:04.506 --> 01:05:08.761
Hurry up, goddammit! Clear that pump.

01:05:09.011 --> 01:05:12.598
We're behind schedule.

01:05:14.224 --> 01:05:17.811
Give it to me.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.449
Guard!

01:05:37.957 --> 01:05:42.878
Tell Conley to resume pumping.

01:05:44.838 --> 01:05:48.217
This is yours, I believe.

01:05:48.467 --> 01:05:52.054
Defuse it.

01:07:15.846 --> 01:07:17.348
Well!

01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:20.768
- Pola lvanova!
- James Bond!

01:07:21.018 --> 01:07:25.648
- Check the beach area.
- Let's get out of here.

01:07:52.508 --> 01:07:55.970
That feels wonderful!

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.764
Feels even better from where I'm sitting.

01:07:59.014 --> 01:08:03.644
- Would you like it harder?
- James, you haven't changed.

01:08:03.894 --> 01:08:05.938
Well, you have.

01:08:06.188 --> 01:08:09.775
You're even lovelier.

01:08:09.817 --> 01:08:15.155
James, that night in London
when I was with the Bolshoi...

01:08:15.406 --> 01:08:17.073
What a performance!

01:08:17.323 --> 01:08:20.327
In my dressing room later...

01:08:20.578 --> 01:08:26.792
Did you know I was an agent
with orders to seduce you?

01:08:27.167 --> 01:08:32.840
Why do you think I sent you
three dozen "red" roses?

01:08:33.256 --> 01:08:37.136
Now that "was" a performance.

01:08:50.357 --> 01:08:53.736
Quite a coincidence,
us running into one another!

01:08:53.986 --> 01:08:57.740
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- Let's not talk shop.

01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:59.992
Let's put on something more...

01:09:00.242 --> 01:09:04.330
- inspirational.
- Why not?

01:09:23.265 --> 01:09:24.975
Are you all right?

01:09:25.225 --> 01:09:27.435
The bubbles tickle my...

01:09:27.685 --> 01:09:31.273
Tchaikovsky!

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:35.944
Détente can be beautiful.

01:09:36.069 --> 01:09:41.200
This is no time to be discussing politics.

01:10:05.015 --> 01:10:06.767
Pola?

01:10:07.017 --> 01:10:08.018
Yes, darling?

01:10:08.269 --> 01:10:13.899
You know something? Tomorrow
I shall buy you "six" dozen red roses.

01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:18.571
How lovely darling. I can't wait.

01:10:36.839 --> 01:10:40.426
The tape?

01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:58.485
<i>The Silicon Valley operation
must not be delayed.</i>

01:11:00.237 --> 01:11:06.327
<i>Main Strike's in three days.
Any delays, I hold you responsible.</i>

01:11:06.577 --> 01:11:12.875
<i>It's essential the remaining pipelines
are open on time.</i>

01:11:20.591 --> 01:11:23.510
Our economy needs
investors like Mr Zorin.

01:11:23.761 --> 01:11:26.931
California welcomes him with open arms.

01:11:27.181 --> 01:11:30.643
- May I quote you on that, Mr Howe?
- Certainly.

01:11:30.893 --> 01:11:33.687
Is there anything else I can tell
the "Financial Times"?

01:11:33.938 --> 01:11:40.361
Yes. My readers want to know why Zorin
is pumping sea water "into" his pipeline

01:11:40.611 --> 01:11:42.780
instead of pumping oil out.

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:47.576
Sea water is used to test
the integrity of the pipeline.

01:11:47.826 --> 01:11:51.413
It's a lot safer than oil.
Just in case there are any leaks.

01:11:51.664 --> 01:11:54.917
Well, I didn't know that.

01:11:55.167 --> 01:11:58.837
Well, thank you, Mr Howe.
That about wraps it up.

01:11:59.088 --> 01:12:03.384
Would you come this way, please?

01:12:06.637 --> 01:12:09.682
If you'd like any further information
just call me, Mr...

01:12:09.932 --> 01:12:14.853
Stock. James Stock.
Thank you, Mr Howe.

01:12:16.272 --> 01:12:17.982
- Mr Howe!
- Stacey, what do you want?

01:12:18.232 --> 01:12:21.110
I have some porosity tests
I want to show you.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:26.073
I can only spare a couple of minutes.

01:12:26.448 --> 01:12:30.035
Sorry.

01:15:13.699 --> 01:15:15.784
Come out real slow.

01:15:16.035 --> 01:15:20.706
Just another Zorin stooge, Mr...
whatever your name was.

01:15:20.956 --> 01:15:24.335
Actually, it's James Stock.
London "Financial Times".

01:15:24.585 --> 01:15:27.212
You can tell the police which.

01:15:27.463 --> 01:15:31.133
And you can tell them about the $5
million payoff you received from Zorin.

01:15:31.383 --> 01:15:35.638
I saw the cheque.

01:15:37.973 --> 01:15:40.851
You cut the line.

01:15:41.101 --> 01:15:44.688
Get back.

01:15:48.525 --> 01:15:52.071
Sit down.

01:16:09.588 --> 01:16:11.882
- What's this loaded with?
- Rock salt.

01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:15.594
Now you tell me.

01:16:25.479 --> 01:16:28.857
No!

01:16:38.826 --> 01:16:41.287
The vase! No!

01:16:41.537 --> 01:16:45.124
Take this.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.087
Oh, hell!

01:16:54.508 --> 01:16:58.095
Sorry, Granddad.

01:16:58.887 --> 01:17:02.224
Hey, wait for me!

01:17:15.988 --> 01:17:17.865
Thank you.

01:17:18.115 --> 01:17:19.783
My pleasure.

01:17:20.034 --> 01:17:23.162
All the king's horses and all his men
won't do much with that.

01:17:23.412 --> 01:17:25.831
That's all right.
It was Granddad's ashes.

01:17:26.081 --> 01:17:28.208
But he always loved a good fight.

01:17:28.459 --> 01:17:31.003
I'm Stacey. Sutton.

01:17:31.253 --> 01:17:33.547
- Yes.
- And... you're a reporter.

01:17:33.797 --> 01:17:35.841
- What was it?
- Stock. James Stock.

01:17:36.091 --> 01:17:38.886
- Right.
- Yes, I'm researching an article on Zorin.

01:17:39.136 --> 01:17:42.932
I used a friend's name
to get an invitation to the chateau.

01:17:43.182 --> 01:17:45.392
I can tell you a few things about Zorin.

01:17:45.643 --> 01:17:47.478
I'd like to hear them.

01:17:47.728 --> 01:17:49.813
I have to feed him. Are you hungry?

01:17:50.064 --> 01:17:53.651
- What are you serving? Whiskas?
- I only have leftovers in the fridge.

01:17:53.901 --> 01:17:56.403
- I'm a pathetic cook.
- I'll lend a hand.

01:17:56.654 --> 01:18:01.784
- You can cook?
- I've been known to dabble.

01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:14.088
Sounds interesting. What is it?

01:18:14.338 --> 01:18:16.215
An omelette.

01:18:16.465 --> 01:18:18.884
Now, you were telling me
about your grandfather.

01:18:19.134 --> 01:18:23.514
He left Sutton Oil to Dad - who expected
me, as the only child, to take it over.

01:18:23.764 --> 01:18:27.184
- So at college I studied geology.
- And then what happened?

01:18:27.434 --> 01:18:31.814
Zorin. He took over Sutton Oil
in a rigged proxy fight.

01:18:32.064 --> 01:18:34.608
I fought him in the courts.
It's taken all I had.

01:18:34.858 --> 01:18:37.778
All the cash, the furniture, everything.

01:18:38.028 --> 01:18:40.072
So I took this job as state geologist

01:18:40.322 --> 01:18:44.827
and I've just managed
to hold on to the house and my shares.

01:18:45.077 --> 01:18:48.414
And that's what the $5 million were for?
Your shares?

01:18:48.664 --> 01:18:53.919
Ten times more than they're worth.

01:18:54.503 --> 01:18:57.840
Just drop the lawsuit and shut my mouth.

01:18:58.090 --> 01:18:59.842
I haven't accepted yet.

01:19:00.092 --> 01:19:05.306
So Zorin sent along his gorillas
to help you make up your mind.

01:19:05.556 --> 01:19:09.435
They have.

01:19:12.896 --> 01:19:19.069
I'd sell everything and live in a tent
before I give up.

01:19:39.465 --> 01:19:42.635
That was delicious.

01:19:42.885 --> 01:19:46.597
And the way you handled those men.

01:19:46.847 --> 01:19:49.516
Well, those...

01:19:49.767 --> 01:19:52.186
baboons could come back.

01:19:52.436 --> 01:19:56.023
I hope not.

01:19:56.982 --> 01:19:59.693
Well, then, I'll...

01:19:59.944 --> 01:20:04.281
check the windows and doors, and...

01:20:04.531 --> 01:20:09.662
- Reconnect the telephone.
- The box is outside my bedroom window.

01:20:09.912 --> 01:20:15.042
I think I should be able to find that.

01:21:19.982 --> 01:21:21.775
Good morning.

01:21:22.026 --> 01:21:25.738
Oh, I say! Breakfast "out" of bed.

01:21:25.988 --> 01:21:28.240
- What's wrong with them?
- We had an earth tremor.

01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:31.493
They're extremely sensitive
to seismic activity.

01:21:31.744 --> 01:21:36.373
Let's see what
the Earthquake Center has on it.

01:21:36.624 --> 01:21:42.254
Just a minor tremor. Measured 2.5
on the Richter scale. Location...

01:21:42.504 --> 01:21:46.800
That's odd.
The epicentre's near Zorin's oil field.

01:21:47.051 --> 01:21:51.639
I told Howe yesterday that Zorin was
pumping sea water into his wells.

01:21:51.889 --> 01:21:54.433
- Is there a connection?
- Sea water?

01:21:54.683 --> 01:21:57.144
Those wells are in the Hayward fault.

01:21:57.394 --> 01:22:00.230
- Are you sure?
- I checked it myself.

01:22:00.481 --> 01:22:04.360
That's incredibly dangerous.

01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:08.405
Howe "has" to stop Zorin now.

01:22:21.502 --> 01:22:23.254
- What happened?
- I got fired.

01:22:23.504 --> 01:22:26.715
- He fired me.
- All right. Calm down.

01:22:26.966 --> 01:22:29.885
This evening we'll meet
a friend of mine from Washington.

01:22:30.135 --> 01:22:36.100
Maybe, just maybe,
he'll come up with a few answers.

01:22:42.064 --> 01:22:46.110
I wish we could be more specific about
Zorin's intentions before I go to the top.

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:49.363
Flooding a fault
could cause a major earthquake.

01:22:49.613 --> 01:22:52.575
But what would Zorin have to gain?

01:22:52.825 --> 01:22:57.496
On the tape Zorin mentioned Silicon
Valley. Could that be affected?

01:22:57.746 --> 01:23:00.666
No, not severely.
Silicon Valley's too far away.

01:23:00.916 --> 01:23:05.379
But if we knew how many wells were
involved, we might get a clearer picture.

01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:09.049
That information's available at City Hall.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.428
- I still have my security pass.
- Then let's go to City Hall.

01:23:12.678 --> 01:23:16.098
- Let me go and get it.
- I'll tell Washington we need more help.

01:23:16.348 --> 01:23:20.769
Don't waste any time.
There's only 24 hours.

01:24:12.655 --> 01:24:17.576
- Good evening, Jeff.
- Evening, ma'am.

01:24:19.036 --> 01:24:22.790
- Won't be long
- OK.

01:25:18.429 --> 01:25:21.765
- Main Strike.
- Hey, I know that place.

01:25:22.016 --> 01:25:28.564
That's an abandoned silver mine
by the San Andreas fault.

01:25:29.106 --> 01:25:34.320
Alive and well, I see.
And still bungling in the dark.

01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:37.740
Well, then,
why don't you enlighten me, Zorin?

01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:40.075
You're out of your depth.

01:25:40.326 --> 01:25:46.123
And you, Sutton. You should have
accepted my more than generous offer.

01:25:46.373 --> 01:25:49.877
- You can take your offer and shove it.
- Don't bother, Stacey

01:25:50.127 --> 01:25:52.463
He's a psychopath.

01:25:52.713 --> 01:25:56.258
You two have joined forces?

01:25:56.508 --> 01:26:02.264
- That simplifies things.
- He's probably armed.

01:26:11.065 --> 01:26:12.733
Stacey, I...

01:26:12.983 --> 01:26:14.526
Mr Zorin.

01:26:14.777 --> 01:26:18.447
Call the police, Mr Howe.

01:26:18.656 --> 01:26:22.826
- What's going on?
- Tell them... there's been a break-in.

01:26:23.077 --> 01:26:26.121
Ask them to get here
as soon as possible.

01:26:26.372 --> 01:26:29.041
You're being used, Mr Howe.

01:26:29.291 --> 01:26:32.878
Do it.

01:26:34.755 --> 01:26:36.131
Hello.

01:26:36.382 --> 01:26:38.425
We've had a break-in here.

01:26:38.676 --> 01:26:43.764
<i>- City Hall, office 306. Come at once.
- Right away.</i>

01:26:44.014 --> 01:26:47.685
- What have they done?
- You discharged her.

01:26:47.935 --> 01:26:51.397
So she and her accomplice
came here to kill you.

01:26:51.647 --> 01:26:55.776
Then they set fire to the office
to conceal the crime,

01:26:56.026 --> 01:27:00.155
but they were trapped in the elevator.

01:27:00.406 --> 01:27:04.660
And perished in the flames.

01:27:05.411 --> 01:27:08.914
But that means I would have to be...

01:27:09.164 --> 01:27:12.459
Dead.

01:27:15.504 --> 01:27:18.757
That's rather neat. Don't you think?

01:27:19.008 --> 01:27:22.386
Brilliant.
I'm almost speechless with admiration.

01:27:22.636 --> 01:27:27.558
Intuitive improvisation
is the secret of genius.

01:27:27.808 --> 01:27:33.689
"Herr Doktor" Mortner
will be proud of his creation.

01:27:46.994 --> 01:27:50.581
Please.

01:27:53.375 --> 01:27:56.962
Get back.

01:28:30.412 --> 01:28:33.040
- Out.
- Let's go.

01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:36.335
Get back!

01:29:18.377 --> 01:29:21.964
Hold tight.

01:29:31.223 --> 01:29:33.142
Come on, Stacey.

01:29:33.392 --> 01:29:37.271
Give me your hand. Stretch!

01:29:43.819 --> 01:29:47.406
Don't go away.

01:29:53.996 --> 01:29:58.000
James, don't leave me!

01:30:03.088 --> 01:30:06.675
Help me!

01:30:10.137 --> 01:30:14.350
Help me!

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:29.323
I'll be right with you.

01:30:33.285 --> 01:30:35.204
Help!

01:30:35.454 --> 01:30:42.795
- It "is" the City Hall.
- I'll call the fire department.

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:48.300
Try and come this side of the girder.

01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:50.678
- Catch this.
- I can't reach it!

01:30:50.928 --> 01:30:53.222
Come on. Catch!

01:30:53.472 --> 01:30:57.268
Now... push!

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:21.292
Go on.

01:31:22.751 --> 01:31:27.047
Good girl. You're nearly there.

01:31:27.214 --> 01:31:30.593
Go on, stretch!

01:31:46.358 --> 01:31:49.111
Get this TV crew outta here, will ya?

01:31:49.361 --> 01:31:53.032
Come on. Get outta my way.

01:32:00.164 --> 01:32:08.172
All we know is that there are
people trapped inside of City Hall.

01:32:10.549 --> 01:32:14.845
Come on. Back off, will ya?

01:32:54.343 --> 01:32:57.930
Let us through, goddammit.

01:33:13.404 --> 01:33:19.827
Give her some air.
Comin' through. Out of the way, please.

01:33:20.369 --> 01:33:23.038
Stacey! You're safe.

01:33:23.289 --> 01:33:27.543
Let me through, goddammit.

01:33:27.793 --> 01:33:29.253
I wanna talk to you.

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:32.715
Captain. If you can get to
Howe's office you'll find him dead.

01:33:32.965 --> 01:33:34.883
We found him - and this gun. This yours?

01:33:35.134 --> 01:33:37.511
- Yes, thanks.
- Turn around.

01:33:37.761 --> 01:33:41.307
If you check with Chuck Lee of the CIA,
he'll inform you who I am.

01:33:41.557 --> 01:33:44.351
- We found his body in Chinatown.
- What?

01:33:44.602 --> 01:33:46.437
- You're under arrest.
- Wait.

01:33:46.687 --> 01:33:49.940
This is James Stock
of the London "Financial Times".

01:33:50.190 --> 01:33:52.651
Actually I'm with
the British Secret Service.

01:33:52.902 --> 01:33:55.195
The name is Bond. James Bond.

01:33:55.446 --> 01:33:57.364
- Is he?
- Are you?

01:33:57.615 --> 01:33:58.741
Yes.

01:33:58.991 --> 01:34:03.954
And I'm Dick Tracy
and you're still under arrest.

01:34:05.456 --> 01:34:09.043
Get in here.

01:34:16.383 --> 01:34:21.597
Hey, where's that guy goin'?
That ladder's unlocked.

01:34:22.765 --> 01:34:25.726
Is that true what you said
about the British secret service?

01:34:25.976 --> 01:34:29.563
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

01:34:30.022 --> 01:34:36.737
My real name "is" Bond. James Bond.
You must take my word for it.

01:34:56.006 --> 01:34:57.299
Put your hand on this.

01:34:57.549 --> 01:35:02.471
The wheel! Take over.
Put your foot on here.

01:35:04.515 --> 01:35:08.394
James, where are you going?

01:35:08.686 --> 01:35:13.440
<i>To all units. Intercept murder suspect
in stolen fire truck.</i>

01:35:13.691 --> 01:35:18.153
He may be armed
and he's sure dangerous.

01:35:18.404 --> 01:35:23.701
- Pull away you idiots.
- I can't. The fenders are locked!

01:35:38.716 --> 01:35:44.680
- I told you, they're locked!
- Oh, my God, watch out!

01:36:01.405 --> 01:36:04.950
- James!
- Turn!

01:36:08.704 --> 01:36:11.957
Not this way. That way!

01:36:24.136 --> 01:36:27.932
- Swing me back!
- Oh, jeez!

01:36:45.741 --> 01:36:49.328
Drive on!

01:37:01.048 --> 01:37:05.344
- I think I can get him.
- Go for it!

01:37:21.277 --> 01:37:25.614
That should keep them
on the wrong track.

01:37:28.826 --> 01:37:30.661
Hello.

01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:34.915
Raise the bridge? Right now?

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:37.167
Yes, sir!

01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:41.839
I got him. Oh, jeez, I got him!

01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:54.351
Keep going!

01:38:14.246 --> 01:38:17.833
Oh, my God!

01:38:23.756 --> 01:38:28.177
Hey, watch out! Get out of the way!

01:38:30.596 --> 01:38:34.183
Jesus!

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:38.187
Oh, mother!

01:38:42.107 --> 01:38:44.401
Holy shit!

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:47.988
Move it!

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:56.497
Harris...

01:38:56.747 --> 01:38:58.916
Forget about that sergeant promotion.

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:04.964
You'll have to pay for this vehicle.
100 bucks a month out of your paycheck.

01:39:12.388 --> 01:39:15.891
Oh, no!

01:39:21.063 --> 01:39:24.275
Wake up. We're there.

01:39:24.525 --> 01:39:27.069
There's a lot of activity
for an abandoned mine.

01:39:27.319 --> 01:39:31.407
That truckload of explosives
should last them for months.

01:39:31.657 --> 01:39:34.034
Here comes next year's supply.

01:39:34.285 --> 01:39:37.871
Get down.

01:39:45.504 --> 01:39:50.217
- Where's the fire?
- On your rear end.

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:02.646
Give me a hand.

01:40:09.111 --> 01:40:12.031
Gerry...

01:40:15.409 --> 01:40:18.621
- It's the rules. Hard hat area.
- Thanks.

01:40:18.871 --> 01:40:22.458
Follow the signs.

01:40:28.923 --> 01:40:32.509
Move it. You're late!

01:40:33.302 --> 01:40:36.180
You two, come here.

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:38.223
Give us a hand unloading this.

01:40:38.474 --> 01:40:39.934
OK, leave it there.

01:40:40.184 --> 01:40:46.148
Get a coffee over at the hut.
Come back in 20 minutes.

01:40:46.232 --> 01:40:51.987
It's women's lib.
They're taking over the Teamsters.

01:40:52.238 --> 01:40:57.701
OK, get this stuff movin'!
We're an hour late.

01:41:07.503 --> 01:41:11.715
I should take a closer look at that mine.

01:41:13.008 --> 01:41:17.596
What's stopping you?

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:24.812
That's a good idea of yours.
Pity you couldn't find one that fits.

01:41:28.691 --> 01:41:30.943
Why walk when you can ride?

01:41:31.193 --> 01:41:34.947
Keep it coming, keep it coming.

01:41:35.197 --> 01:41:38.784
OK, let's go.

01:41:40.077 --> 01:41:41.912
Will you keep still!

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:46.166
Do you know what I'm sitting on?

01:41:47.418 --> 01:41:51.714
I'm trying not to think about it.

01:42:04.226 --> 01:42:07.813
<i>Stand clear.</i>

01:42:08.981 --> 01:42:17.239
<i>All personnel not on essential duties,
leave underground area immediately.</i>

01:42:20.451 --> 01:42:24.872
<i>Standby crew, we need you up here.</i>

01:42:31.462 --> 01:42:35.049
<i>Ready to unload.</i>

01:42:39.136 --> 01:42:43.140
<i>OK, stand clear.</i>

01:42:44.391 --> 01:42:47.978
<i>Let's go, standby crew.</i>

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:53.984
<i>Break off. Stand clear.</i>

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:10.709
<i>Standby forward. Bring the gag
up here and clear these barriers away.</i>

01:43:12.503 --> 01:43:17.508
Come on, let's go. We haven't got all day.

01:43:17.758 --> 01:43:21.470
Clear the safety barrier.

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:28.769
Come on, move!

01:43:29.019 --> 01:43:33.190
Hey, on the crane!
Swing the cradle over here.

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.819
Take it off.

01:43:58.048 --> 01:44:01.885
Bring it over. Easy.

01:44:10.185 --> 01:44:15.316
- You found anything?
- Yes. I think I have.

01:44:17.026 --> 01:44:18.944
Good.

01:44:19.194 --> 01:44:22.990
Good. Hold 'em.

01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:37.463
OK, get those wedges in there tight!

01:44:49.934 --> 01:44:53.145
Come on, lay the head down here. OK?

01:44:53.395 --> 01:44:58.692
The San Andreas Lake is right above us.
Lots of seepage. Could flood any minute.

01:44:58.943 --> 01:45:03.030
Finish shoring up the roof.
I'll send the lug back.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:04.448
OK.

01:45:04.698 --> 01:45:09.328
Bring up some timber, on the double!

01:45:15.501 --> 01:45:18.295
He'll kill millions.

01:45:18.545 --> 01:45:22.299
These green lights -
they're Zorin's oil wells.

01:45:22.549 --> 01:45:26.428
The ones he's been using to pump
sea water into the Hayward fault.

01:45:26.679 --> 01:45:29.139
What are these tunnels for
under these lakes?

01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:33.602
These lead straight into this section
of the San Andreas fault.

01:45:33.852 --> 01:45:39.525
Zorin just has to blast through the
bottom of these lakes to flood the fault.

01:45:39.775 --> 01:45:44.697
- And create a... double earthquake?
- Yes. Except...

01:45:44.947 --> 01:45:48.701
Except right beneath us
is the key geological lock

01:45:48.951 --> 01:45:52.913
that keeps the faults from moving at once.

01:45:53.163 --> 01:45:57.167
Hey, let's go!

01:46:08.762 --> 01:46:13.183
All those explosives.
Would they be enough to break the lock?

01:46:13.434 --> 01:46:15.686
Of course!

01:46:15.936 --> 01:46:19.315
If they go off, both faults move at once.

01:46:19.565 --> 01:46:23.569
Silicon Valley and everything in it
submerged for ever.

01:46:23.819 --> 01:46:31.035
If it happened at the peak of
the spring tide for maximum effect...

01:46:33.704 --> 01:46:37.249
That's today at 9.41.
In less than an hour!

01:46:37.499 --> 01:46:42.129
- We have to go and warn people.
- Wait!

01:46:46.592 --> 01:46:49.803
Stand back.

01:46:51.263 --> 01:46:54.600
Jump!

01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:06.487
Get him.

01:47:14.411 --> 01:47:20.084
- Get 'em back to work.
- You men, get back to work.

01:47:20.417 --> 01:47:22.211
It's Bond.

01:47:22.461 --> 01:47:26.298
Close up the entrance. Nobody gets out.

01:47:26.548 --> 01:47:28.300
Hold it!

01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:31.470
In.

01:47:40.771 --> 01:47:42.523
Come on.

01:47:42.773 --> 01:47:49.071
- Did you pass anyone back there?
- No. I saw no one.

01:47:51.532 --> 01:47:55.202
- Now which way?
- The map.

01:48:01.041 --> 01:48:03.002
There's a draught from up there.

01:48:03.252 --> 01:48:08.173
- It must be a ventilation shaft.
- Wait!

01:48:15.723 --> 01:48:18.642
That must lead to the fault.
The water from the lakes!

01:48:18.893 --> 01:48:23.731
Yes. And it'll be flooding any moment.

01:48:24.565 --> 01:48:28.152
Come on.

01:48:35.868 --> 01:48:39.455
You two, that way.

01:49:01.018 --> 01:49:04.438
Give me your hand.

01:49:24.833 --> 01:49:28.837
It's time to flood the fault.

01:49:32.508 --> 01:49:34.718
But... May Day. And my men.

01:49:34.969 --> 01:49:37.429
Yeah. A convenient coincidence.

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:42.142
Mr Zorin, those men are loyal to you.

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.985
Hurry!

01:49:51.235 --> 01:49:55.531
- Get help. Quick!
- Get a doctor.

01:50:30.858 --> 01:50:35.279
Come on, run for your life!

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:50.336
Give me some spare clips.

01:51:28.332 --> 01:51:31.794
Keep climbing!

01:51:45.391 --> 01:51:48.519
Keep going!

01:52:01.407 --> 01:52:03.993
James!

01:52:43.449 --> 01:52:47.119
Good. Right on schedule.

01:52:51.916 --> 01:52:55.502
Let's go.

01:53:29.286 --> 01:53:32.373
And I thought that creep loved me!

01:53:32.623 --> 01:53:37.878
You're not the only one
he double-crossed.

01:53:51.684 --> 01:53:56.605
All outboard valves fully locked, sir.

01:54:16.292 --> 01:54:20.296
The water level's dropping.

01:54:25.467 --> 01:54:29.513
Pump pressure good.

01:54:40.357 --> 01:54:41.066
Jenny!

01:54:41.317 --> 01:54:46.196
Come on. There's nothing
you can do for them now.

01:54:53.495 --> 01:54:57.708
Up and away!

01:55:33.327 --> 01:55:37.248
Silicon Valley. Perfect!

01:55:37.498 --> 01:55:40.584
Hold position here.

01:55:40.834 --> 01:55:46.465
Only minutes more, Carl.
Nothing can stop it now.

01:55:46.715 --> 01:55:50.803
The greatest cataclysm in history.

01:55:51.053 --> 01:55:55.891
And all attributed to natural causes.

01:55:56.141 --> 01:55:59.728
Exactly.

01:56:00.854 --> 01:56:04.441
We must hurry.

01:56:04.775 --> 01:56:06.902
I have to get down
and defuse that detonator.

01:56:07.152 --> 01:56:09.530
You can't.
The time has been booby trapped.

01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:12.241
If you tamper with it
we're going to blow up.

01:56:12.491 --> 01:56:15.619
Then we have to bring
the whole thing up. But how?

01:56:15.869 --> 01:56:18.956
Get on the rig. I'll lower you down.

01:56:19.206 --> 01:56:22.793
Get on!

01:56:46.025 --> 01:56:47.568
Keep going!

01:56:47.818 --> 01:56:51.405
Come on.

01:56:52.239 --> 01:56:55.826
OK, hold it there.

01:57:01.707 --> 01:57:02.958
Take it up!

01:57:03.208 --> 01:57:06.128
- Get on!
- It's too heavy. Go!

01:57:06.378 --> 01:57:09.965
Get on, dammit!

01:57:11.967 --> 01:57:15.554
OK, go!

01:57:37.159 --> 01:57:40.746
Keep going!

01:57:55.427 --> 01:57:57.388
That's it.

01:57:57.638 --> 01:58:01.433
Swing it over to the truck.

01:58:04.853 --> 01:58:08.440
Easy. Gently!

01:58:11.402 --> 01:58:14.572
Right, lower it.

01:58:15.281 --> 01:58:16.949
Take her up.

01:58:17.199 --> 01:58:24.456
We've only seconds before this blows.
If it does, that powder keg goes with it.

01:58:36.635 --> 01:58:40.556
The handbrake slipped.

01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:46.186
Push!

01:58:47.521 --> 01:58:50.566
- Jump!
- I have to hold the brake off.

01:58:50.816 --> 01:58:52.318
Jump!

01:58:52.568 --> 01:58:56.155
Get Zorin for me!

01:58:56.238 --> 01:58:59.325
May Day, jump!

01:58:59.909 --> 01:59:01.869
Only seconds to go.

01:59:02.119 --> 01:59:05.247
May Day, jump!

01:59:08.334 --> 01:59:11.921
May Day!

01:59:39.031 --> 01:59:42.201
James.

01:59:56.882 --> 02:00:00.678
Stacey, behind you! Get down!

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:13.899
Come on, get in. Get up here!

02:00:14.483 --> 02:00:20.781
The ship's nose is heavy.
He must be on the mooring rope.

02:01:30.142 --> 02:01:34.230
This'll hurt him more than me.

02:02:15.354 --> 02:02:19.066
More! More power.

02:02:25.364 --> 02:02:28.659
More. Do it!

02:02:43.257 --> 02:02:46.886
Full throttle!

02:02:55.102 --> 02:02:59.189
Right rudder. Do it!

02:03:08.657 --> 02:03:09.950
Stop it!

02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:12.202
Get her off!

02:03:12.453 --> 02:03:17.583
- Stop it! Are you crazy?
- Get her off. Get away!

02:03:33.891 --> 02:03:37.478
Go get him.

02:03:37.561 --> 02:03:40.856
Go!

02:03:50.074 --> 02:03:53.661
Stacey, jump!

02:03:56.455 --> 02:04:00.709
Get a foothold!

02:05:02.771 --> 02:05:06.358
Max!

02:05:17.828 --> 02:05:20.706
James!

02:05:20.956 --> 02:05:24.585
Stacey, give me your hand.

02:05:25.294 --> 02:05:28.631
Get under the pipe.

02:05:35.387 --> 02:05:38.599
OK, stay there.

02:05:50.152 --> 02:05:53.739
James, look out!

02:06:04.667 --> 02:06:08.671
Stacey, hold tight!

02:06:18.430 --> 02:06:22.560
- Stacey, are you there?
- You betcha!

02:06:34.905 --> 02:06:40.035
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

02:06:40.578 --> 02:06:45.332
There's never a cab when you want one.

02:06:45.416 --> 02:06:48.377
The Order of Lenin, for Comrade Bond.

02:06:48.627 --> 02:06:52.423
The first time ever awarded
to a non-Soviet citizen.

02:06:52.673 --> 02:06:57.636
I'd have expected the KGB to celebrate
if Silicon Valley "had" been destroyed.

02:06:57.887 --> 02:07:01.682
On the contrary, Admiral.

02:07:02.141 --> 02:07:07.479
Where would Russian
research be without it?

02:07:09.148 --> 02:07:12.484
Is Commander Bond here?
I'd like to thank him personally.

02:07:12.735 --> 02:07:16.405
Sadly he's missing.
We are continuing our search,

02:07:16.655 --> 02:07:20.743
but must presume the worst.

02:07:59.907 --> 02:08:03.369
A bit of soap here... and a little soap there!

02:08:03.619 --> 02:08:07.289
- Oh, drat! I've dropped the soap.
- I'll get it.

02:08:07.539 --> 02:08:11.377
"That" is not the soap.

02:08:18.217 --> 02:08:20.886
<i>- Hello?
- Grandfather calling Q.</i>

02:08:21.136 --> 02:08:24.056
<i>- What's the position?
- 007 alive.</i>

02:08:24.306 --> 02:08:29.812
<i>- Where is he? What's he doing?
- Just cleaning up a few details.</i>

02:08:30.062 --> 02:08:33.649
Oh, James...!

02:08:34.305 --> 02:08:40.514
