WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.543
...building a new world.

00:01.545 --> 00:03.408
That is why I bring with me maids.

00:03.410 --> 00:04.431
To make wives.

00:04.433 --> 00:07.338
When I found you on that wharf,
Silas, it changed everything.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.738
We'll be married in a week.

00:08.740 --> 00:10.780
Silas!

00:11.900 --> 00:15.298
If Samuel is to advance here,
it will require influence.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.938
I will be a good wife to you.
But you will be a good husband...

00:18.940 --> 00:20.780
- Aah!
- ...to me.

00:24.140 --> 00:26.500
You speak the Indian
language well, Sharrow.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.698
You are my eyes and ears here, Samuel.

00:34.700 --> 00:37.098
You are asking me to spy on our governor.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.338
One day, you're going to be governor here.

00:39.340 --> 00:43.418
We did not underestimate her
husband, but we did miscalculate her.

00:43.420 --> 00:45.938
Men, elected to make laws.

00:45.940 --> 00:48.458
The burgesses will serve our colony well.

00:48.460 --> 00:49.978
I'm going to have a child.

00:49.980 --> 00:52.340
Massinger has bought himself some slaves.

00:53.140 --> 00:57.100
Abraham took slaves. We have
fields to plant and harvest.

01:32.140 --> 01:36.058
He tells me that he's
fond of the Low Countries.

01:36.060 --> 01:40.898
But, er... there's old potato
fingers, always too sleep-eyed to go!

01:47.500 --> 01:50.538
No! The baby!

01:50.540 --> 01:52.658
Alice!

01:52.660 --> 01:54.938
Help! Help!

01:57.420 --> 02:00.978
Alice. Alice. I am
here. I am here with you.

02:03.020 --> 02:05.138
Scream the sky down if you need to.

02:05.140 --> 02:08.217
I'm coming! I'm coming!

02:08.220 --> 02:11.900
Maria, help me!

02:46.020 --> 02:48.978
Silas, fetch some wood.

02:48.980 --> 02:50.860
We'll sleep the night here.

03:04.540 --> 03:06.580
Heeeeeeeeh!

03:09.540 --> 03:11.700
- Chacrow.
- So.

03:42.780 --> 03:46.178
Oh, you have yourself a Sharrow boy!

04:30.460 --> 04:33.138
The master ain't here.
And neither will he be.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.218
Nor if he was, would I open the door.

04:35.220 --> 04:37.220
If it weren't already open.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.458
Mercy?

04:48.460 --> 04:51.538
You may tell my husband that
he might join me for breakfast.

04:51.540 --> 04:53.498
He's gone, ma'am. Fishing, ma'am.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.940
Before I so much as woke.
With Dr Priestley, ma'am.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.500
Fishing?

05:45.100 --> 05:46.580
It's Master Castell.

06:15.827 --> 06:20.827
Subtitles by explosiveskull

06:31.580 --> 06:33.178
- Come on.
- Here, up, you see.

06:33.180 --> 06:36.978
I'm telling you, lads, if the
company treats us settlers fairly,

06:36.980 --> 06:39.498
then I'm a pigeon's cock.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.018
You find fault with the
company's business, Rutter?

06:42.020 --> 06:45.698
Oh... If I slander, Marshal Redwick,
sir, it's no fault of me own, sir.

06:45.700 --> 06:49.258
Me... I talk vomit. Me words
have a mind of their own!

06:49.260 --> 06:51.260
Sir!

06:52.660 --> 06:56.898
Is the news from company all
congratulations, Governor?

06:56.900 --> 07:00.618
Tobacco trade thriving, peace
with the Indians, and wives.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.338
Surely our mission is to be garlanded

07:03.340 --> 07:06.578
for making a king's colony
out of mud and cow men.

07:06.580 --> 07:09.418
Look at 'em. We brought
'em here as slave labour,

07:09.420 --> 07:11.378
they move among us as free men.

07:11.380 --> 07:15.460
God would not allow us to keep a
man baptised in chains, Marshal.

07:21.420 --> 07:24.338
Ah, Christopher. You are returned.

07:24.340 --> 07:25.818
But where is Samuel?

07:25.820 --> 07:29.138
- Returned?
- Look at how Jamestown fares.

07:29.140 --> 07:31.020
I counted nine ships alone this month.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.420
Returned from your fishing expedition.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.218
Uh, the master told me so, ma'am.

07:40.220 --> 07:44.740
As I laid my head down on my pillow.
I'm certain of it, truly. Fishing.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.700
- Ma'am!
- Jocelyn!

08:17.340 --> 08:19.418
- Sir...
- It's all right.

08:22.860 --> 08:24.658
Come on.

08:24.660 --> 08:26.420
Oh!

08:42.580 --> 08:46.220
I might wonder if it was the
Indians killed Samuel Castell.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.178
The Recorder drowned.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.258
He weren't the first man
to misjudge the river.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.860
The savages pretend to be
at peace with us, but...

08:54.100 --> 08:56.698
all the while we expand, they
detest our every footstep.

08:56.700 --> 09:00.538
Sir, the Recorder was a friend.
He spoke most often on our behalf.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.698
We knew that.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.340
You've brought in a lot
of hides of late, Sharrow.

09:06.220 --> 09:08.938
This is why we're here, in't it?

09:08.940 --> 09:13.138
To make no end of coin by
the... merry dance of trade.

09:13.140 --> 09:16.458
The men who make profit in this town
want to rustle themselves in silk,

09:16.460 --> 09:19.098
but you look more like a
barbarian every day, Sharrow.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.418
If the Indians see what
they know, they trust it.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.660
Trust is good for trade.

09:25.780 --> 09:27.580
Hey.

09:28.900 --> 09:32.738
Be careful you don't grow too
friendly with them, Sharrow.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.020
We might wonder whose side you're on.

09:39.260 --> 09:41.378
Silas Sharrow, there you are, man.

09:41.380 --> 09:44.018
Get yourself home to your
wife. She's waiting for you.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.858
- With your child!
- Is it a boy?

09:45.860 --> 09:49.058
No, it's a painted maypole.
Get yourself home, you big lump!

09:49.060 --> 09:50.220
Whoo!

09:52.580 --> 09:54.580
Is Alice well?

09:55.620 --> 09:57.620
She will be.

10:04.940 --> 10:06.618
What do you have there, Pedro?

10:07.900 --> 10:10.578
Poesy, Governor.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.620
I was returning them to Recorder Castell.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.458
Why do you possess them?

10:15.460 --> 10:17.498
He was teaching me.

10:17.500 --> 10:21.338
"Virginia's purpose, we repair

10:21.340 --> 10:23.220
"Each man shall have his rightful share

10:24.300 --> 10:26.540
"A house and garden plot receive

10:27.180 --> 10:29.420
"We pray the blessed so achieve

10:30.220 --> 10:32.300
"Men once vagrants, grant so well

10:33.740 --> 10:36.378
"No want, and no conditions ill"

10:36.380 --> 10:38.178
You can read that.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.580
Not yet, sir. Soon.

10:41.420 --> 10:43.938
I learnt it from poor
Master Castell's mouth.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.418
He told me there was beauty in these words.

10:46.420 --> 10:48.140
And promises.

10:50.100 --> 10:54.180
I should get you back to your master.
He'll be wondering where you are.

10:59.540 --> 11:02.738
Dear Jocelyn, I could not bear
the thought of you going abroad

11:02.740 --> 11:04.700
without mourning dress.

11:06.780 --> 11:09.098
Black.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.418
How long will I...

11:10.420 --> 11:12.698
To show my devotion to the master,

11:12.700 --> 11:15.540
I shall wear nothing but
black for the whole year.

11:16.820 --> 11:19.378
A widow's life is short, Jocelyn.

11:19.380 --> 11:22.498
It is not possible for a
woman to remain here unheaded.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.818
Unheaded?

11:24.820 --> 11:28.338
My husband has died, and it seems
as though my head has been cut off.

11:28.340 --> 11:31.980
Without a husband, a woman simply
has no position in Virginia.

11:34.380 --> 11:37.580
Then I do believe that I
must make a place for myself.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.458
When will you learn, Massinger,

11:42.460 --> 11:45.338
that beatings are not the
best way to master them?

11:45.340 --> 11:48.580
Well, with this one, it's the only way.

11:49.620 --> 11:53.378
Tell our governor what you
think of tobacco farming, Pedro.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.578
In Congo, this is women's work.

11:56.580 --> 11:59.100
And what do you say about the English here?

12:00.140 --> 12:03.418
Englishmen such as you,
sir, are my brothers.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.498
These men...

12:05.500 --> 12:07.338
they do not wash.

12:07.340 --> 12:09.498
They do not speak gently.

12:09.500 --> 12:13.858
Tell Governor Yeardley
who you are, Pedro. Huh?

12:13.860 --> 12:17.098
My blood is Mwishi Congo.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.460
I am noble warrior blood.

12:20.860 --> 12:24.140
Sir, Master Castell promised
me he would speak with you.

12:24.820 --> 12:28.218
Did he ask you, sir, if you would
buy me from Master Massinger?

12:32.020 --> 12:34.418
"Virginia's purpose, we repair

12:34.420 --> 12:37.658
"Each man shall have his rightful share

12:37.660 --> 12:39.898
Perhaps you'd like to disburden yourself

12:39.900 --> 12:41.738
of such an upstart, Massinger.

12:41.740 --> 12:43.858
I'll pay handsomely for him.

12:43.860 --> 12:46.858
I could sell him to you,
and rid meself of this...

12:46.860 --> 12:49.018
monstrous bulk of ingratitude,

12:49.020 --> 12:51.378
but... I have a duty.

12:51.380 --> 12:53.818
A duty to the colony, to tame him.

12:53.820 --> 12:55.618
Huh?

12:55.620 --> 12:56.738
Yeah?

13:12.500 --> 13:15.178
Widow Castell, I have the papers

13:15.180 --> 13:18.218
concerning your late husband's estate.

13:18.220 --> 13:20.378
You are cast adrift now, Widow.

13:20.380 --> 13:22.898
And soon, you'll taste the cost of that.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.618
What a pity you did not marry a farmer.

13:25.620 --> 13:28.740
At least, then, you might have
inherited a means by which to live.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.458
Do you believe that poverty places me

13:32.460 --> 13:35.780
at the mercy of the king
and queen of shadows?

13:36.780 --> 13:42.138
Tonight, you might indulge what
grief your shallow soul allows.

13:42.140 --> 13:46.258
At sunrise, you must discharge
yourself and all your possessions

13:46.260 --> 13:49.284
from company property.
The house you live in

13:49.286 --> 13:52.738
was supplied in part payment
for Master Castell's duties.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.738
A new recorder has been appointed,

13:54.740 --> 13:56.898
and he will want to take possession of it.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.580
At dawn, you will find
yourself on the street.

14:02.740 --> 14:04.740
Sir, you may cut me down.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.820
But not so low that my
nails cannot reach your eyes.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.700
Moon.

14:47.140 --> 14:48.740
Sky.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.420
Virginia.

14:52.420 --> 14:55.540
This is my son, and he belongs here.

14:58.220 --> 15:01.540
I do believe the moon smiled upon him.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.660
God promised me a man such as you, Silas.

15:20.860 --> 15:23.658
This is why I came here.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.620
Mm.

15:32.633 --> 15:35.297
This is the terriblest thing.

15:35.299 --> 15:38.297
Oh... Where shall we go, ma'am?

15:38.299 --> 15:40.939
I... I've never lived on the street before!

16:00.419 --> 16:02.417
It is wondrous news, Maria.

16:02.419 --> 16:05.379
Alice's child is God's
gift to our new world.

16:09.979 --> 16:11.457
Thank you, Maria.

16:11.459 --> 16:13.419
For helping with Alice.

16:14.539 --> 16:17.257
When the Portuguese captured me,

16:17.259 --> 16:20.017
my girl was one year.

16:20.019 --> 16:22.019
My sons, a little older.

16:22.939 --> 16:25.097
You can have more babes, Maria.

16:25.099 --> 16:27.577
Here, in Virginia.

16:27.579 --> 16:30.137
Hey, that Pedro's taken a liking to you.

16:30.139 --> 16:32.377
I must go home to them.

16:32.379 --> 16:35.857
They will be waiting for
their mother to return.

16:35.859 --> 16:37.699
You know, I was bought, like you.

16:38.739 --> 16:40.259
Made a life for myself here.

17:00.539 --> 17:02.019
Show me.

17:04.579 --> 17:08.779
I have no brand on me. And you know it.

17:11.699 --> 17:14.618
This will never be my home.

17:38.339 --> 17:40.059
He ain't your child, Henry.

17:41.339 --> 17:43.459
I know it.

17:45.059 --> 17:47.657
I made a crib for him.

17:54.539 --> 17:55.977
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

17:55.979 --> 17:57.979
He ain't yours, neither, Alice.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.697
Belongs to the whole colony.

18:01.699 --> 18:05.379
First born to the maids
that came over a year ago.

18:06.859 --> 18:09.499
You'll see what becomes of that.

18:16.419 --> 18:18.657
We need the house for
the new recorder, Jocelyn.

18:18.659 --> 18:22.697
But, sir, to be made homeless as I
mourn the loss of my dear husband...

18:22.699 --> 18:24.977
I fear that once the
wives of Virginia hear,

18:24.979 --> 18:27.057
they will doubt that the
colony cares for them.

18:27.059 --> 18:28.857
It is a temporary affliction, Jocelyn,

18:28.859 --> 18:30.539
until such a time as you might marry.

18:31.699 --> 18:34.137
A doctor's wife might
prove a pleasing life.

18:34.139 --> 18:37.817
And it will keep you away from
the men's business of politics.

18:37.819 --> 18:39.457
Dear Governor...

18:39.459 --> 18:42.737
if I were to lay my hopes
upon my fondness for you,

18:42.739 --> 18:46.017
if I were to plead, and to place
all my feminine vulnerability

18:46.019 --> 18:48.897
- in your hands...
- Enough, Jocelyn!

18:48.899 --> 18:52.219
I have more pressing matters
than a widow's comfort.

19:26.779 --> 19:29.017
Since that babe was born to Silas Sharrow,

19:29.019 --> 19:32.497
my wife, any hour the moon hangs
in the sky, she wants me foining.

19:32.499 --> 19:35.537
Thought a man might be grateful
for a woman's attentions.

19:35.539 --> 19:37.097
Verity has such a need in her,

19:37.099 --> 19:39.697
I dare not look her in
the eyes for fear of it.

19:39.699 --> 19:41.497
When I try to sleep, I feel her thinking.

19:41.499 --> 19:43.459
I sense her vexation at me.

19:44.619 --> 19:48.097
That's why I was out before
dawn, along the river's edge.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.937
Why might you wander down by the water?

19:49.939 --> 19:53.739
James, I saw Recorder Castell on the river.

19:54.739 --> 19:57.137
- What was he doing?
- That's what I asked him.

19:57.139 --> 20:01.377
And this he answered me. "I am
abroad on the governor's business."

20:01.379 --> 20:03.459
Well, what should I do, James Read?

20:04.899 --> 20:07.179
Well, the recorder's dead.

20:08.059 --> 20:12.699
If there's any politics in it,
you stay well away, Meredith.

20:14.139 --> 20:16.179
A man can be hanged for what he knows.

20:18.339 --> 20:20.897
I hoped you might say as much.

20:36.139 --> 20:39.339
I cannot believe... I dare not believe...

20:40.059 --> 20:42.179
Hey!

20:43.459 --> 20:46.617
Wh... You'll all just stand
around, scratchin' your hairy arses,

20:46.619 --> 20:48.537
when there's a widow needs help?

20:48.539 --> 20:51.497
Take up that furniture
and carry it to the tavern.

20:51.499 --> 20:53.337
There's drink for any man who will.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.017
Ma'am, I must tell thee wh...

20:55.019 --> 20:56.937
It is the most terriblest thing.

20:56.939 --> 21:00.379
You'll, er... stay awhile in
the tavern, Mistress Castell.

21:01.979 --> 21:03.777
Then what shall I do, Verity?

21:03.779 --> 21:07.817
Ma'am, I ain't never been so afraid
of nothing so much as this, nothing.

21:07.819 --> 21:09.499
- Never! Never!
- Hush, child!

21:20.259 --> 21:22.697
- A God-given babe.
- Mm.

21:22.699 --> 21:25.417
The governor believes it
would be most propitious

21:25.419 --> 21:27.817
if you were to name the boy James.

21:27.819 --> 21:29.777
News of it will travel back to England.

21:29.779 --> 21:32.577
The first born, paying honour to our king.

21:32.579 --> 21:34.697
Well... I'd intended to...

21:34.699 --> 21:36.897
It would mean so much to my husband.

21:36.899 --> 21:40.019
To fortify the message
of love for our homeland.

21:43.499 --> 21:44.939
Hm.

21:53.419 --> 21:57.337
At the end of each day's labour,
you'll sleep the night here,

21:57.339 --> 22:00.699
so that, come dawn, I
will know where you are.

22:12.739 --> 22:14.257
What did you say to them?

22:14.259 --> 22:18.777
I told them... you do this to me
because I am the most beautiful man

22:18.779 --> 22:21.097
from the most beautiful country.

22:21.099 --> 22:24.219
So I am loved, and you are not.

22:26.299 --> 22:28.337
Get to work!

22:28.339 --> 22:31.937
♪ Virginia's purpose, we repair

22:31.939 --> 22:35.099
♪ Each man shall have
his rightful share ♪

22:37.579 --> 22:39.097
Come here.

22:39.099 --> 22:41.897
Bringing such politics in
here? You'll have me hanged.

22:41.899 --> 22:43.857
Politics?

22:43.859 --> 22:45.697
To come to the aid of a widow?

22:45.699 --> 22:47.897
You don't know the
quarter of it, that's what.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.859
Make 'em go.

22:51.139 --> 22:52.659
I know what this is.

22:55.659 --> 22:58.937
It contains holy water, or Jesus' blood.

22:58.939 --> 23:00.659
It is an ampulla. Give it to me.

23:03.379 --> 23:06.739
- Mercy, where did you get this?
- The master's cabinet, ma'am.

23:07.379 --> 23:09.497
Ma'am...

23:09.499 --> 23:13.297
It's a crucifix. A Jesuit
crucifix. They're Catholic...

23:13.299 --> 23:15.937
Mercy, on fear of death, you
must not say a word to anyone.

23:15.939 --> 23:18.819
Do you understand? The master
can't have been a Papist.

23:19.739 --> 23:22.019
He in't no traitor.

23:52.053 --> 23:53.693
Maria.

23:54.733 --> 23:57.211
Maria, no, no, no,
Maria, what are you doing?

23:57.213 --> 23:59.731
They'll cut your head
off for such blasphemies.

23:59.733 --> 24:03.291
No one will stop me from making
kiteke to call my husband.

24:03.293 --> 24:07.251
He will come. The spirits will
bring him here to take me home.

24:07.253 --> 24:10.131
Maria, no. Please...

24:10.133 --> 24:14.373
Hey. Any soul who comes here
should have no dream of returning.

24:15.973 --> 24:20.291
Your children will surely have
been taken, just as you were.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.651
The Portuguese will have
captured your husband.

24:22.653 --> 24:26.371
He will be thousands of miles
from home. That life is gone.

24:26.373 --> 24:28.693
You must admit it.

24:29.373 --> 24:34.133
You say this because you do not
know what it is to lose a child.

24:36.013 --> 24:37.891
Damn you.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.611
Your life is here, now.

24:39.613 --> 24:42.371
You're a young woman.
You can bear children.

25:12.613 --> 25:16.051
Maria. This Virginia will be kind to us.

25:16.053 --> 25:18.293
I will be beside you. You will see.

25:23.973 --> 25:28.691
Dear Governor! I could run. But I stay.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.851
I work.

25:30.853 --> 25:33.331
If you buy me from Master Massinger,

25:33.333 --> 25:36.691
I will labour harder than
any tenant man in the field.

25:36.693 --> 25:38.731
I am not in Congo now.

25:38.733 --> 25:40.653
I am in Virginia to stay.

25:46.813 --> 25:48.971
I will be like those men.

25:48.973 --> 25:51.251
I will work for my freedom.

25:51.253 --> 25:53.133
You will see, Maria.

25:54.133 --> 25:56.853
Your master does not
wish to sell you, Pedro.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.931
The Negro Pedro.

26:05.933 --> 26:08.411
Twice run away from my farm, Marshal.

26:08.413 --> 26:11.771
We must teach you to
yield before your master.

26:11.773 --> 26:14.411
Oh, Lord,

26:14.413 --> 26:18.811
we acknowledge and bewail our
manifold sins and wickedness,

26:18.813 --> 26:21.251
which we must grievously have committed.

26:21.253 --> 26:25.891
We have seen what such a
devil blackamoor is capable of.

26:25.893 --> 26:28.451
And let it be known,
the likes of this Negro

26:28.453 --> 26:32.091
cannot leave his master when he chooses to.

26:32.093 --> 26:34.731
He is bought and paid for.

26:34.733 --> 26:38.571
To permit such a creature
to defy his master,

26:38.573 --> 26:40.891
and to allow him to speak
God's words before us,

26:40.893 --> 26:43.571
will bring this colony
down before it's built.

26:43.573 --> 26:45.493
- Marshal!
- Master Read!

26:46.133 --> 26:48.173
Chains.

26:48.893 --> 26:50.893
Take him.

26:51.973 --> 26:53.413
Verity Rutter.

27:02.533 --> 27:06.053
Now, Mistress Rutter, you
were struck by this Negro here.

27:07.173 --> 27:09.971
Who, Maria? No, sir.

27:09.973 --> 27:12.331
I witnessed the affray.
Do you say that I'm lying?

27:12.333 --> 27:15.253
Sir, I fear your eyes have led you astray.

27:16.413 --> 27:18.411
It was I who struck Maria.

27:18.413 --> 27:20.811
Why would you strike the Negro?

27:20.813 --> 27:24.651
Well, she called my husband a drunken sot.

27:24.653 --> 27:27.291
And a mangy mongrel of a man, sir.

27:27.293 --> 27:30.691
And it was my wifely
duty to defend my husband.

27:30.693 --> 27:33.013
Against the truth. Sir.

27:42.813 --> 27:45.051
Ma'am...

27:45.053 --> 27:47.411
I cannot believe what I've heard.

27:47.413 --> 27:49.171
That you were cast out of your own home.

27:49.173 --> 27:52.453
Something is happening, Alice,
that I do not comprehend.

27:53.053 --> 27:56.691
I'm told you are to name the babe
James in honour of the king, Alice.

27:56.693 --> 27:58.691
Uh...

27:58.693 --> 28:01.691
Pepper, what is it the governor
wants with your brothers?

28:01.693 --> 28:03.531
It's a meeting of the burgesses, ma'am.

28:03.533 --> 28:07.453
I was sent away on account
that it's secret business.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.653
Gentlemen.

28:11.693 --> 28:14.131
I bring sour news.

28:14.133 --> 28:16.013
We have a traitor amongst us.

28:16.853 --> 28:18.731
I received news from England

28:18.733 --> 28:21.891
that a secret message
from Spain was intercepted.

28:21.893 --> 28:24.771
The Count of Gondomar,
Ambassador to England,

28:24.773 --> 28:27.533
retains a vile temper towards us.

28:28.493 --> 28:30.331
He believes that Jamestown Negroes

28:30.333 --> 28:32.491
were stolen from Spain by privateers,

28:32.493 --> 28:34.773
and sold to us illegally.

28:35.893 --> 28:40.771
King Philip calls our
settlement "a nest of pirates".

28:40.773 --> 28:43.491
The Papist lice still
refuse to recognise Virginia

28:43.493 --> 28:45.211
as our God-given claim.

28:45.213 --> 28:49.731
It seems that an informer
has been placed amongst us,

28:49.733 --> 28:52.411
bought, no doubt, by Gondomar's gold.

28:52.413 --> 28:54.571
A Catholic spy.

28:54.573 --> 28:58.331
The van is one week from here. The
Spanish could attack us at any time.

28:58.333 --> 28:59.771
We must expose the traitor,

28:59.773 --> 29:02.411
before he confides vital
information about our defences.

29:02.413 --> 29:06.013
Every man here must serve king and company.

29:06.933 --> 29:10.491
Keep your eyes and your ears open.

29:10.493 --> 29:12.813
A noose awaits the turncoat.

29:23.893 --> 29:26.533
It's my work, Pedro, that's all.

29:31.653 --> 29:34.133
You heard the marshal pass an order.

29:35.053 --> 29:37.853
I have no wish to chain any man.

29:38.813 --> 29:40.891
It's my work.

29:40.893 --> 29:42.691
That's all.

29:42.693 --> 29:45.451
When I first stepped onto this land,

29:45.453 --> 29:47.893
yours was the face I saw, waiting for me.

29:49.413 --> 29:51.413
Oh, a beautiful face.

29:53.133 --> 29:55.491
Yeah, not so beautiful as mine.

29:55.493 --> 29:57.531
But I am Congo.

29:57.533 --> 30:00.493
No man is as beautiful as a Mwishi Congo.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.891
That pride of yours is
gonna see you killed.

30:04.893 --> 30:06.973
Ah, this pride will save me.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.251
Why can't you just bow
before Master Massinger?

30:10.253 --> 30:12.171
Give him no defiance?

30:12.173 --> 30:17.011
My ancestors will disavow me if
I bend before a rampaging fool,

30:17.013 --> 30:20.373
who brags and stamps and grunts like a pig.

30:24.533 --> 30:26.533
Then run.

30:27.533 --> 30:29.891
Virginia's a vast country.
A man could get lost in it.

30:29.893 --> 30:33.093
Eh, do you think me a coward, James Read?

30:34.773 --> 30:36.653
No.

30:37.733 --> 30:39.733
I am Pedro.

30:40.693 --> 30:42.853
I am not a slave.

30:43.893 --> 30:46.971
But the English labourers
have a fixed term.

30:46.973 --> 30:50.011
Then they will be free,
given their own land.

30:50.013 --> 30:53.451
My release will only come when
Master Massinger grants it.

30:53.453 --> 30:56.891
That is why Yeardley must buy me.

30:56.893 --> 30:59.853
He will name a time
when I can be my own man.

31:02.253 --> 31:05.211
They were discovered
amongst Simon's belongings.

31:05.213 --> 31:07.613
What should I do, Christopher?

31:08.293 --> 31:10.611
You must tell the governor.

31:10.613 --> 31:14.211
How can I? They will suspect
me of being a Catholic spy, too.

31:14.213 --> 31:16.173
A spy.

31:17.213 --> 31:19.893
Why may the governor
concern himself with spies?

31:21.813 --> 31:25.773
Isn't every Papist presumed a traitor
and hanged as Spain's informer?

31:27.573 --> 31:29.291
Jocelyn.

31:29.293 --> 31:32.091
The very act of giving these to Yeardley

31:32.093 --> 31:34.693
will persuade him that you are innocent.

31:36.173 --> 31:38.171
You knew Samuel better than anyone.

31:38.173 --> 31:40.411
You would see if there
were reason to suspect...

31:40.413 --> 31:43.051
No corner of my heart wants
to accept the possibility

31:43.053 --> 31:45.371
that he was a secret Papist.

31:45.373 --> 31:49.373
But see what lies here before us, Jocelyn.

31:51.693 --> 31:54.571
Please, for your own safety,

31:54.573 --> 31:57.051
you must confide what you have discovered.

31:57.053 --> 31:58.651
You must tell the governor.

31:58.653 --> 32:02.613
I cannot inflict another
betrayal upon Samuel.

32:03.573 --> 32:07.531
I hurt the living man so much. His
dead soul deserves my faithfulness.

32:07.533 --> 32:10.333
It is dangerous to possess such things.

32:13.813 --> 32:15.333
What will you do with them?

33:00.253 --> 33:02.733
You.

33:03.813 --> 33:05.293
A Catholic.

33:06.613 --> 33:08.293
Master Read, I am no Papist.

33:09.333 --> 33:11.533
You have totems.

33:12.493 --> 33:14.651
They were Samuel's.

33:14.653 --> 33:16.851
I discovered them after his death.

33:16.853 --> 33:19.333
I wished only to honour my husband.

33:20.493 --> 33:23.491
Go ahead. Denounce me.

33:23.493 --> 33:27.171
I am at the mercy of a
man whose soul is as grisly

33:27.173 --> 33:29.533
as the chains he uses to bind another.

33:35.533 --> 33:36.973
I bullied Samuel.

33:39.413 --> 33:41.413
And, to wound him...

33:43.013 --> 33:45.931
I used the pleasures of
the bed to manipulate him.

33:45.933 --> 33:47.933
And he knew why.

33:50.053 --> 33:52.613
I married him that I might escape England.

33:55.693 --> 33:57.693
I never loved Samuel.

34:01.093 --> 34:04.291
That is why I am here.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.733
To place the totems inside his coffin.

34:08.813 --> 34:11.811
He deserves one last
act of loyalty from me.

34:15.213 --> 34:17.333
Don't leave them in the casket.

34:18.813 --> 34:20.893
They'll be found.

34:37.213 --> 34:41.130
If you've had enough of me pipe,
just sauce up and be done with it.

34:41.132 --> 34:43.893
Ugh. Hell's teeth, man.

34:45.933 --> 34:50.091
Go and walk the streets, as you're
fond to do when I want your foining.

34:50.092 --> 34:52.851
I ain't going out. I ain't
gonna risk hearing news

34:52.853 --> 34:56.453
that could get a... a
rope round a man's neck.

34:57.373 --> 34:59.331
Hearing what?

34:59.333 --> 35:01.413
I ain't saying. I ain't telling.

35:06.893 --> 35:09.131
Recorder Castell.

35:09.133 --> 35:12.291
On the day he died, I... I
met him on the river, and he...

35:12.293 --> 35:14.931
told me he was about
on governor's business.

35:14.933 --> 35:17.291
- His wife must be told of this.
- I ain't saying.

35:17.293 --> 35:19.333
This concerns a dead man's death.

35:20.213 --> 35:21.933
What could that lead to? Chhhkkk!

35:23.173 --> 35:27.531
You white-livered,
leek-brained crow!

35:27.533 --> 35:29.331
You're so drunk with fear,

35:29.333 --> 35:32.051
you haven't got a
finger's dignity about you.

35:32.053 --> 35:33.571
What are we to do?

35:33.573 --> 35:35.533
Honour a widow.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.253
Thank you, Verity.

36:32.733 --> 36:34.333
Open the coffin.

36:37.253 --> 36:39.331
Open it!

36:39.333 --> 36:41.453
I need to see what it contains.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.853
Bury the man.

37:13.094 --> 37:15.574
Hello, Alice!

37:15.576 --> 37:17.976
Hey, congratulations!

37:20.000 --> 37:22.858
Mercy, each day, you clean
every cranny of that house.

37:22.860 --> 37:24.817
Have you ever discovered
any such totems before?

37:24.819 --> 37:25.721
Never.

37:25.723 --> 37:28.431
And you prepared your master's
clothes for many a year.

37:28.433 --> 37:30.671
Did you ever notice anything unfavourable?

37:30.673 --> 37:32.271
Ma'am, my head is turning to a pain,

37:32.273 --> 37:35.873
because I can't make no
sense of nothing inside of it.

37:38.193 --> 37:40.313
Congratulations, Alice. A fine baby!

37:44.153 --> 37:46.551
And what name have you chosen?

37:46.553 --> 37:48.353
His name is...

37:52.553 --> 37:54.831
He's to be called Silas.

37:54.833 --> 37:58.833
I wish my son to respect his father
for all his days by bearing his name.

38:07.353 --> 38:10.951
I baptise thee in the name
of the Father, and of the Son,

38:10.953 --> 38:13.111
and of the Holy Ghost.

38:13.113 --> 38:14.631
Amen.

38:56.433 --> 38:58.953
I learned something in that church today.

39:00.873 --> 39:03.193
It's time I had a wife.

39:08.313 --> 39:12.711
My mistress told me I am to be
done with my weeping and wailing.

39:12.713 --> 39:15.593
Only... once I have sorrow on me,

39:16.553 --> 39:18.591
I don't know how to stop squalling.

39:18.593 --> 39:21.153
Perhaps you might weep
when she is not there.

39:22.073 --> 39:23.513
I never thought of that.

39:25.873 --> 39:27.993
You are clever, Pepper.

39:33.313 --> 39:35.313
I trust you know, Jocelyn,

39:36.513 --> 39:39.753
that I feel the loss of Samuel
almost as much as you do.

39:42.353 --> 39:44.673
And I will show my devotion to him

39:45.713 --> 39:48.073
by offering you my constant service.

39:50.993 --> 39:52.993
Thank you, Christopher.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.273
Jocelyn, what is it?

39:59.913 --> 40:02.673
Love is no more than a
dog barking at a crow.

40:12.993 --> 40:15.273
A moment, please.

40:16.353 --> 40:19.513
This blood is English blood.

40:21.033 --> 40:24.951
Silas and Alice begot not
only a... a beautiful boy,

40:24.953 --> 40:27.433
but they give birth to God's will.

40:28.273 --> 40:30.471
Each new generation

40:30.473 --> 40:34.271
will bring endless expansion
across this country,

40:34.273 --> 40:37.391
and that is our purpose here.

40:37.393 --> 40:40.273
To conquer all in front of us.

40:54.673 --> 40:57.671
Is this the noble warrior, Pedro?

40:57.673 --> 41:00.391
I have seen it in Yeardley's eyes.

41:00.393 --> 41:04.991
He would not leave me chained here
when he knows I could work for him.

41:04.993 --> 41:07.191
He sees I am the best.

41:07.193 --> 41:09.791
Is this the freedom their God gives to you?

41:09.793 --> 41:12.311
I will learn all their Bible's words,

41:12.313 --> 41:14.871
so that I might use them
to prick their souls.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.911
They forbid our language.

41:16.913 --> 41:18.791
They take our spirits from us.

41:18.793 --> 41:21.351
I will work on their fields,
but I refuse to believe.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.591
Ah, then you refuse to hope.

41:23.593 --> 41:26.351
Maria, I promise you,

41:26.353 --> 41:30.351
this life will be kind to us, if we adapt.

41:30.353 --> 41:33.111
I will teach you how to enjoy these skies

41:33.113 --> 41:35.073
and this art like it was our own.

41:35.953 --> 41:38.671
We cannot fight them.

41:38.673 --> 41:43.433
But we will have our freedom if we wait.

41:44.753 --> 41:46.153
If we accept.

41:48.673 --> 41:51.353
Every time you tell me this...

41:52.593 --> 41:54.593
ngana, Pedro...

41:55.873 --> 41:57.953
I will curse you.

42:08.673 --> 42:10.673
Land.

42:12.193 --> 42:14.473
Our land.

42:19.913 --> 42:21.913
Our Virginia.

42:23.233 --> 42:25.233
Sh, sh, sh.

42:29.833 --> 42:32.073
- Chacrow.
- Silas.

42:33.873 --> 42:36.713
You show your child the beautiful world.

42:39.913 --> 42:41.671
Hm.

42:41.673 --> 42:44.191
You said you would meet with me.

42:44.193 --> 42:46.231
Silas.

42:46.233 --> 42:49.073
You promised you would help us.

42:51.193 --> 42:54.033
My son was born, Chacrow.

42:54.953 --> 42:57.233
It wasn't possible for me to come to you.

43:00.073 --> 43:03.713
I will not act as a spy
against my own people.

43:21.593 --> 43:24.031
When English came here,

43:24.033 --> 43:26.831
you said you would not
stay, but you are still here.

43:26.833 --> 43:30.431
I want to repay you, Chacrow,
I promise you that I will, but...

43:30.433 --> 43:32.393
Opechancanough wants to know.

43:33.593 --> 43:37.713
Is Yeardley seeking pacts with
the other towns along the river?

43:38.593 --> 43:42.511
Your brother was lost. Did we not help you?

43:42.513 --> 43:47.471
I told Opechancanough that
Silas would keep his promise

43:47.473 --> 43:50.191
to give us information about the English.

43:50.193 --> 43:52.871
I will come and speak with you.

43:52.873 --> 43:54.433
Please, you must go. Now.

44:04.273 --> 44:06.273
Alice?

44:10.113 --> 44:11.593
Who were you talking to?

44:15.513 --> 44:17.713
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

44:20.313 --> 44:22.513
I was comforting the babe.

44:23.953 --> 44:26.071
I thought I heard another voice.

44:26.073 --> 44:28.953
What you heard, my pet,
was your husband singing.

44:30.833 --> 44:32.473

45:01.993 --> 45:04.511
These are what you expected
to find in the coffin,

45:04.513 --> 45:07.031
are they not, dear Governor?

45:07.033 --> 45:10.271
Did someone speak to you, to
alert you to the possibility?

45:10.273 --> 45:12.351
An anonymous note placed under my door

45:12.353 --> 45:14.311
to warn me that there might be evidence

45:14.313 --> 45:17.511
that Samuel Castell was
a Catholic spy amongst us.

45:17.513 --> 45:20.191
Hm. What a marvellous convenience,

45:20.193 --> 45:22.951
that a dead man should be exposed
as a friend of the Spanish,

45:22.953 --> 45:25.031
at the very time you are
seeking out a traitor.

45:25.033 --> 45:28.031
Then why bring such as these to my house?

45:28.033 --> 45:30.591
Because I know who the true conspirator is.

45:30.593 --> 45:32.751
Well, you're the one
with the totems, Jocelyn.

45:32.753 --> 45:34.391
Why don't I suspect you?

45:34.393 --> 45:37.631
Sir, you've already
conceived it cannot be me.

45:37.633 --> 45:39.671
I am merely a woman.

45:39.673 --> 45:41.873
I must be kept away from politics.

45:43.073 --> 45:45.113
I want my home returned to me.

45:45.953 --> 45:47.873
And then I will tell you who the Judas is.

46:23.033 --> 46:25.951
Master Read, let me thank
you for your chivalry.

46:25.953 --> 46:28.313
You saved me from a perilous fate.

46:34.033 --> 46:36.153
Why do you not wear your loss...

46:37.393 --> 46:39.991
as a map of war?

46:39.993 --> 46:42.073
Look how the dress becomes you.

46:43.913 --> 46:45.913
Black...

46:47.193 --> 46:49.953
can make a woman appear witchly.

47:00.993 --> 47:04.873
My heart may be tainted
with the filth of chains,

47:06.073 --> 47:09.433
but if I am to be slapped,
it will be of a just cause,

47:10.273 --> 47:12.273
and by a just soul.

47:42.802 --> 47:45.591
Are you proposing that we rob the company?

47:45.593 --> 47:48.391
This is what I call
dealings well done. Oof!

47:48.393 --> 47:50.791
I'll catch any criminal who defies the law.

47:50.793 --> 47:53.151
I'm married to a traitor!

47:53.153 --> 47:55.471
Imagine when our fields are
full of men such as Pedro.

47:55.473 --> 47:57.951
Would you permit me to make
a gift of the Negro to you?

47:57.953 --> 48:00.591
This man is arrested
under a charge of thieving!

48:00.593 --> 48:02.711
Do you witness what merciless authority

48:02.713 --> 48:04.111
our governance is built upon?

48:04.113 --> 48:05.831
Who's there?

48:05.833 --> 48:09.031
I wish you'd, Henry
Sharrow! He will kill me!
