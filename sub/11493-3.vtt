09:47.133 --> 09:48.333
No, you're not a genius,

09:48.335 --> 09:50.168
you're not a prodigy.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.336
Nice.

09:51.338 --> 09:54.055
My own father
doesn't think I'm special.

09:54.057 --> 09:55.390
Oh.

09:56.760 --> 09:57.809
On the contrary.

09:57.811 --> 10:01.646
Your father thinks
you're very special.

10:03.632 --> 10:06.351
Of course, I'm the dummy
sleeping on the floor.

Hey, I'm getting dressed
for my dinner with Bridget.

10:27.276 --> 10:28.525
How do I look?

10:28.527 --> 10:30.977
Your face should be
on gay money.

10:30.979 --> 10:32.829
Listen, um...

10:34.582 --> 10:37.617
You say something to my son
about quitting high school

10:37.619 --> 10:38.818
and starting a business?

10:38.820 --> 10:41.088
Oh, yeah, I told him
that's what I did.

10:41.090 --> 10:44.124
Hey, what do you think
about a hat?

10:44.126 --> 10:45.792
The only reason
to wear a hat on date

10:45.794 --> 10:46.993
is if you're hiding a bald spot.

10:46.995 --> 10:48.428
Oh.

10:50.214 --> 10:51.848
For your next date.

10:54.668 --> 10:56.520
Thank you.

10:56.522 --> 10:58.671
So you really quit high school?

10:58.673 --> 10:59.806
Mmm, no.

10:59.808 --> 11:01.358
I skipped high school.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.609
I quit MIT.

11:02.611 --> 11:04.611
Oh, okay. See, there's
the misunderstanding.

11:04.613 --> 11:07.898
Jake has a hard time
spelling MIT.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.617
Oh. Well, then, he really
shouldn't quit school.

11:10.619 --> 11:12.869
Hey, check it out.

11:12.871 --> 11:14.454
My socks match my sneakers.

11:14.456 --> 11:17.023
But your sneakers
don't match each other.

11:17.025 --> 11:20.043
Oh...

11:21.212 --> 11:23.246
Bridget used to pick out
all my outfits.

11:23.248 --> 11:24.831
I can see why you miss her.

11:24.833 --> 11:27.534
Well, uh, thank you for
clearing the Jake stuff up.

11:27.536 --> 11:28.585
Yeah, no problem.

11:28.587 --> 11:30.253
Uh, and, uh, going forward,

11:30.255 --> 11:32.705
keep in mind that kids like him
are looking for role models,

11:32.707 --> 11:34.374
so you have to be careful
around them.

11:34.376 --> 11:36.293
Yeah, sure.
Although, truth to tell,

11:36.295 --> 11:38.929
unless he sees you passed out
in a pool of vomit

11:38.931 --> 11:41.148
with a tattooed prostitute,
you're going to be

11:41.150 --> 11:43.233
an improvement
in the role model department.

11:43.235 --> 11:46.103
Hey, Alan?
Yeah?

11:46.105 --> 11:48.721
You got a lot of experience
with women, right?

11:54.112 --> 11:56.729
A lot?
I don't know.

11:56.731 --> 12:00.450
You know, I've, uh, been
around the block a few times.

12:00.452 --> 12:03.587
Did a little dance,
made a little love,

12:03.589 --> 12:06.256
got down tonight
on several occasions.

12:07.825 --> 12:09.176
Um, why do you ask?

12:10.261 --> 12:13.463
What can I do to convince
Bridget to take me back?

12:14.298 --> 12:15.582
Oh.

12:17.302 --> 12:20.554
Walden, Walden,
Walden, Walden.

12:20.556 --> 12:22.088
Come sit.

12:22.090 --> 12:24.441
Really? I got to sit?

12:34.285 --> 12:38.288
A woman's heart is a deep
and mysterious place,

12:38.290 --> 12:40.440
almost impossible
to reach.

12:40.442 --> 12:42.492
Much like the G-spot.

12:43.878 --> 12:47.614
Although at least we know
the heart, in fact, exists.

12:47.616 --> 12:49.166
Okay, is that it?
Can I stand up now?

12:49.168 --> 12:50.550
Oh, no. H-hang on.
Hang on.

12:50.552 --> 12:53.453
When that heart closes
itself to a man--

12:53.455 --> 12:56.089
and in my experience,
it inevitably does--

12:56.091 --> 13:00.227
the only way to reopen it
is to allow time to pass.

13:00.229 --> 13:02.629
That way, the
woman can reflect

13:02.631 --> 13:04.815
on how much she
misses her man.

13:05.650 --> 13:06.850
And that's worked
for you?

13:06.852 --> 13:09.135
Oh, yeah.

13:09.137 --> 13:11.855
There are quite a
few ladies out there

13:11.857 --> 13:15.242
currently reflecting on how
much they miss Alan Harper.

13:15.244 --> 13:17.194

Thank you.
Look, Walden,

14:20.175 --> 14:21.558
I agreed to have dinner with you

14:21.560 --> 14:23.476
because I care about you,
but I just...

14:23.478 --> 14:25.228
Are we going to have sex later?

14:25.230 --> 14:26.646
Let me finish.

14:26.648 --> 14:27.981
But no.

14:27.983 --> 14:29.882
Aw.

14:29.884 --> 14:32.185
The thing is,
even though I care about you,

14:32.187 --> 14:34.020
this marriage is over.

14:34.022 --> 14:35.605
I don't want to get
a divorce.

14:35.607 --> 14:37.657
Why do we got to get a divorce?

14:37.659 --> 14:38.775
Because I have grown up

14:38.777 --> 14:41.077
and you are still the same guy
you were at 19.

14:41.079 --> 14:42.112
No, that is not true.

14:42.114 --> 14:43.246
I got a lot more money now.

14:43.248 --> 14:44.497
Money isn't the point.

14:44.499 --> 14:46.082
I got lawyers,
I got accountants,

14:46.084 --> 14:47.900
I got my own

But what if I can?
