I love you, man.

Hm?

29:01.360 --> 29:03.351
Yeah, I appreciate it.

29:20.560 --> 29:23.154
Oh!

29:23.200 --> 29:27.433
- It's a sex bag.
- Ha. You expect me to wear that?

31:04.040 --> 31:06.839

31:06.880 --> 31:09.315
No, nothing. Not a dickybird.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.719
Something must have really upset him.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.314
Oh, shit.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.397
I don't want to even say it.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.238
What?

31:20.280 --> 31:21.793
Well, do you think he's found out
about me and you and all the shagging...

31:21.840 --> 31:24.036
- Shh!
- He already knows.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.549
Oh, I know about his soft cock
and everything.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.079
You with him?

31:28.120 --> 31:31.476
<i>Er...</i> no, don't look at me like that,
cos you're in love with a turtle, <i>so...</i>

31:31.520 --> 31:35.753
- Fair point. Sorry about the soft cock.
- Thanks, Ab.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.950
Can we just get back to Finn, please?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.638
Why do you think he might
have found out about us?

31:39.680 --> 31:43.230
So, I'm sat in there on the couch.
I'm drawing a smiley face on a bag.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.874
Little man stands in the fucking doorway,

31:45.920 --> 31:48.719
fixes me with this look,
"I love you, man."

31:48.760 --> 31:52.230
Right, now, was he saying,
"I love you, man,

31:52.280 --> 31:56.513
"but you have stabbed me in my back,
and you've gone and shat in my mouth"?

31:56.560 --> 31:59.632
I was like, "No, no, no! I'm sorry. Me and
my big floppy cock, we're really sorry."

31:59.680 --> 32:01.876
"Well, it's too late
for fucking sorry, arsehole!"

32:05.840 --> 32:07.990
- Stop it.
- RUDY: Sorry.

32:11.560 --> 32:12.914
(WHISPERS) Sam.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.997
I made love to her.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.110
You all right?

32:16.160 --> 32:17.594

32:17.640 --> 32:19.950
No! Helen.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.310
- Electro girl from the jumper.
- Sweet.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.954
- Yeah.
- Did she shock your balls?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.718
Why would she shock my balls?

32:26.760 --> 32:29.149
I don't know.
Maybe she's into kinky stuff.

32:29.200 --> 32:33.114
What's the matter with you?
No, she's not kinky. She's lovely.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.595
We'd better sit down.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.439
I've got something for you.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.471
Yeah?

32:46.480 --> 32:50.189
But this... this has already happened.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.914
I started it last week.
I meant to give it to you then.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.712
It took me a while to finish it.

32:54.760 --> 32:58.276
- What, so now you knit the past?
- Only when my arthritis is playing up.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.557
RUDY:
You see me and Helen on this jumper?

33:01.600 --> 33:04.638
This is proof, isn't it?
This is proof that it comes true.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.194
You can't fight destiny, you can't.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.272
Electro girl, is she up
for the whole superhero thing?

33:11.320 --> 33:13.914
No. No, not exactly.

33:13.960 --> 33:18.511
But I... I've tried to persuade her,
but she's not interested.

33:18.560 --> 33:21.359
- Is it cos the sex was really bad?
- No!

33:21.400 --> 33:24.199
- No, the sex was brilliant.
- Yeah, maybe for you.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.551
It was... Listen. It's got nothing
to do with my sexual performance.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.477
I've just got to show her
it's her destiny, that's all.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.796
I mean it's all coming together. It is.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.114
Yeah.

33:39.160 --> 33:43.279
But three of us
to convince it's a good idea.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.071
How you doing, mate?

33:49.120 --> 33:50.713
FINN: It's Weird.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.912
It's like I haven't got
the energy to keep living.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.756
And I was wondering why you felt
like that, to be honest with you, man.

33:58.800 --> 34:02.430
Why... why? <i>Has...</i> something upset you?

34:03.440 --> 34:04.635
- Like what?
- I don't know.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.751
Just... just something very upsetting,

34:06.800 --> 34:08.757
like...

34:09.760 --> 34:14.960
...like a friend maybe doing
something to another friend?

34:16.679 --> 34:19.513
Was this you? What were you doing?

34:22.159 --> 34:23.911
I was clubbing a baby seal.

34:25.000 --> 34:25.989
Why?

34:26.040 --> 34:29.920
Because we got into a bit of a dispute
over some fish.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.473
Neither of us were gonna back down.

34:31.520 --> 34:35.478
It all got a bit out of hand, to be honest
with you, so I fucking just boshed him.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.190
Bosh.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.311
Mm-hm.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.317
Someone should do that to me.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.112
Don't say shit like that, man.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.679
If they did, could I have your GCSEs?

34:50.719 --> 34:53.553
Oi! Have you heard this shit?

34:53.600 --> 34:55.431
You know it's not transferable,
your GCSEs, when you die?

34:55.480 --> 34:57.994
- Yeah.
- What the fuck is all that about?

34:58.040 --> 35:00.680
You need a fucking GCSE in science
just to understand all this shit.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.438
What did Finn say?
Has he found out about us?

35:02.480 --> 35:04.517
No, he thinks I've killed a baby seal.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.239
ALEX: Well, look, guys, all of this stuff,

35:07.280 --> 35:09.510
it's gonna be something
to do with the storm, isn't it?

35:09.560 --> 35:13.110
Who's this fucking guy, man?
Clever and handsome. It's unbelievable.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.150
Just before Finn turned suicidal,

35:14.200 --> 35:16.555
I saw him talking
to one of them terminally ill people.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.432
What if he did something to him?

35:18.480 --> 35:21.199
Well...

35:21.240 --> 35:23.675
they chose the wrong day to do that.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.360
Just made a big mistake.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.311
They better be prepared to meet the raper.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.078
Do you mean the reaper?

35:30.120 --> 35:32.157
No, I mean the raper.
I'm talking about him.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.158
Mate, I'm not a rapist.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.590
What did you do to our friend?

35:44.640 --> 35:46.631
And don't bother denying it,
cos we know it was you.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.956
(GASPS)

35:58.000 --> 36:01.277
Er... someone told me there was
a really nice view from the roof.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.960
Hm. I wouldn't say it's nice.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.877
It's just the same shit
from a different angle, really.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.797
Oh, I don't... I'd like to see that.

36:20.200 --> 36:23.113
Get out of this one, you sneaky bastard.
Hey, hurry up.

36:23.160 --> 36:25.515
- I'm hurrying up, man.
- Come on.

36:27.600 --> 36:32.629
Errn... this isn't as bad as it looks,
and I'm aware it looks bad.

36:32.680 --> 36:34.159
I think I know
what happened to your friend.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.555
Sorry? What?

36:36.600 --> 36:38.876
- I know what happened to your friend.
- Yeah, love.

36:38.920 --> 36:42.151
And so do we. It's time for this
little guy to meet the frigging raper.

36:42.200 --> 36:46.273
- Can you stop calling me the raper?
- It wasn't him. It was Lucas.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.919
Ah, God.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.194
Sorry, dude.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.834
Mate, are you OK?

37:02.640 --> 37:03.630
Will you hold me?

37:08.160 --> 37:10.436
Look, I'm not going to shag you,
because I'm in love with my turtle.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.550
<i>Oh. Oh, I...</i>

37:11.600 --> 37:16.117
But I feel really bad about you dying and
everything, so I'll give you a hand job.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.151
<i>Er...</i>

37:20.400 --> 37:22.277
...would... would you hold me afterwards?

37:22.320 --> 37:25.676
Hm, yeah, a wank and a cuddle.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.631

Oh! Oh!

38:02.200 --> 38:03.918
Get the fuck away from him!

38:06.040 --> 38:07.713
Why is his cock out?

38:07.760 --> 38:09.751
Hand job.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.189
Look, he sucked the life out of Finn.

38:13.520 --> 38:17.718
That's why Finn wants to die and why
that bloke threw himself off the roof.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.119
You did it to them, didn't you?

38:24.480 --> 38:27.120
What was I meant to do?

38:27.160 --> 38:29.629
I'm meant to just let myself die?

38:30.960 --> 38:35.591
No! No, you guys have
no idea what it feels like.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.712
I... I can feel myself dying.

38:39.760 --> 38:42.149
I can feel it

38:42.200 --> 38:43.474
and I'm scared.

38:44.680 --> 38:49.629
So, you're just going to keep doing it,
then, letting other people die?

38:49.680 --> 38:51.034
You are killing them!

38:51.080 --> 38:53.799
Just fuck off! Fuck you!

38:53.840 --> 38:56.400

38:56.440 --> 38:58.078
Why me?

38:58.120 --> 39:00.589
Why has it got to be me?

39:00.640 --> 39:05.635
It's a crappy deal, mate. But all this
other shit is wrong, and you know it is.

You're the final piece of the superhero

<i>I...</i> I knew it.
It's all coming together.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.873

to meet the others.

The jumper posse?

There will be vodka and drugs
and people fucking each other.

You and me, we're finished!

Women don't know what they do to us.

45:26.560 --> 45:29.154
