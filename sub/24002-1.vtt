03:16.821 --> 03:19.156
Do you always play alone?

03:19.365 --> 03:22.910
Challenging yourself can teach you
quite a bit about who you are.

03:24.870 --> 03:28.165
Plus, I always win.

03:32.503 --> 03:35.506
Or lose.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.258
A matter of perspective.

03:43.180 --> 03:46.183
Olivia.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.686
Lovely to see you.

03:48.894 --> 03:49.894
And you, Jimmy.

03:50.062 --> 03:51.397
Hmm.

03:51.605 --> 03:53.983
No one's called me
Jimmy in years.

03:54.191 --> 03:56.360
Well, that's too bad.
It suits you.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.155
Not so sure about
that these days.

03:59.363 --> 04:02.992
Well, you'll always
be Jimmy to me.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.579
Do you have time to
grab a cup of coffee?

04:06.787 --> 04:08.122
Catch up a little?

04:08.330 --> 04:10.750
I'm afraid we're on
a tight schedule.

04:10.958 --> 04:13.210
No time for chit-chat.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.921
All right, just
give me a moment.

04:26.932 --> 04:30.102
How you feeling about all this?

04:30.311 --> 04:33.522
Well, this process is
a little different.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.566
But you think you're ready?

04:35.775 --> 04:40.613
Well, I do think I'm ready
for anything at this point.

04:40.821 --> 04:42.406
I hope so.

04:48.537 --> 04:50.873
Wait. Pocket.

04:54.835 --> 04:57.213
Again.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.549
Arms up.

05:03.969 --> 05:06.138
Yeah, I'll be getting
that back, yes?

05:11.685 --> 05:13.270
You are not to
touch the subject.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.898
Do not leave anything
near the subject's hands.

05:16.106 --> 05:18.067
If the subject makes a request,

05:18.275 --> 05:21.529
you are to seek my permission before
granting the subject anything.

05:21.737 --> 05:23.531
I, uh, I mean no offense,

05:23.739 --> 05:26.450
but, uh, is all this
entirely necessary?

05:26.659 --> 05:28.577
If you have a problem
following these rules,

05:28.786 --> 05:31.205
then I suggest that you
conduct your evaluation

05:31.413 --> 05:34.917
from inside the control room per
my original recommendation.

05:35.125 --> 05:37.127
No, that won't be required.

05:37.336 --> 05:40.381
Do not, for any reason, release
the subject from the restraints.

05:40.589 --> 05:42.550
In the event the subject
escapes the restraints,

05:42.758 --> 05:44.718
drop to the floor and
cover your head.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.262
Do not attempt to
leave the room.

05:46.470 --> 05:48.347
Do not attempt to
re-restrain the subject.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.391
- Understood?
- Yeah.

05:50.599 --> 05:53.477
- Understood?
- Yes, understood.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.288
Dr. Fonda.

06:12.496 --> 06:14.582
I see you've met colonel birch.

06:14.790 --> 06:17.793
The military is
assisting in this case.

06:18.002 --> 06:21.839
I hardly think "assisting"
is a sufficient term.

06:22.047 --> 06:24.633
Thank you for that
clarification, colonel.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.403
All right, so show me
what we've got here.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.679
This is Dr. Keaton, our
director of psychiatry.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.282
Yeah, nice to meet you, Dr.
Keaton.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.266
Always a pleasure to
meet a fellow shrink.

06:32.474 --> 06:36.395
Well, I hate to disappoint, but, uh,
technically I'm a psychologist.

06:36.604 --> 06:41.233
Oh. Oh, well, we can't
all be perfect, eh?

06:42.735 --> 06:43.986
When the light is green,

06:44.194 --> 06:46.488
you are go to zap
that little fucker.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.949
And this charming young
man is Ryan mccrosky,

06:49.158 --> 06:51.994
our chief technician.
Ryan, this is Dr. Fonda.

06:52.202 --> 06:53.537
Hey.

06:55.414 --> 06:58.667
Dr. Warner is our resident
biochemistry expert.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.837
Ah, nice to meet you, Dr.
Warner.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.088
Likewise.

07:12.431 --> 07:14.391
It's time.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.978
If you don't mind, colonel, I'd
like to walk Dr. Fonda over myself.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.441
Be my guest.

07:26.153 --> 07:27.529
You'll have to excuse them.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.698
It's my fault they've had
to spend so much time

07:29.907 --> 07:31.116
in that little room.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.243
Well, you're the boss.

07:42.544 --> 07:44.004
All clear, agent price.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.965
Thank you, gentlemen.

07:57.309 --> 08:01.146
I know this all seems
a bit strange, but...

08:01.355 --> 08:04.650
Please try to go in there
with an open mind.

08:04.858 --> 08:08.654
Well, if I couldn't do
that, I wouldn't be here.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.995
Thank you, Jimmy.

08:39.308 --> 08:42.312
Hello, Eleanor. My
name is James Fonda.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.899
- I am here to...
- I love the sweater vest.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.568
Well, thank you. I'm not all...

08:47.776 --> 08:48.944
You have it all.

08:49.153 --> 08:52.239
Worn loafers,
second hand slacks,

08:52.448 --> 08:55.951
tattered briefcase.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.280
I'm not quite sure I follow.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.705
But the truth is in the details.

08:59.913 --> 09:02.958
The lines on your face.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.419
Your posture.

09:05.627 --> 09:08.922
Distinct lack of concern
with your hairstyle.

09:13.010 --> 09:16.638
Did miss Olivia send a
bargain bin find in with me?

09:19.391 --> 09:21.143
How quaint.

09:25.272 --> 09:27.691
You're a very
observant young lady.

09:30.277 --> 09:33.405
I assume you have experience
with troubled youth.

09:33.614 --> 09:37.284
Most likely from
bad neighborhoods.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.495
What makes you say that?

09:39.703 --> 09:41.830
That must be challenging work.

09:44.249 --> 09:48.128
I imagine the return rate isn't
particularly high in those situations.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.926
It must wear on you, not
being able to save them.

09:56.178 --> 10:00.140
It does, but it also
makes each success

10:00.349 --> 10:02.226
that much more satisfying.

10:02.434 --> 10:07.106
And that's so conducive to a
satisfying home life, I feel, is it?

10:09.358 --> 10:11.985
It is hard for me to
imagine your loving wife

10:12.194 --> 10:13.904
allowing you out of
the house in your...

10:14.113 --> 10:15.697
Current state.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.407
My wife?

10:22.412 --> 10:26.375
It is, unless she
isn't around anymore.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.420
You shut her out, didn't you?

10:33.006 --> 10:36.426
To look at you, I'd say you
shut most everyone out.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.473
Is it easier to keep them away

10:41.682 --> 10:44.226
than to risk getting hurt again?

10:55.988 --> 10:58.824
That was quite an
evaluation, Eleanor.

10:59.032 --> 11:01.451
Don't call me Eleanor.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.995
What should I call you?

11:03.203 --> 11:05.497
Ellie is better.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.332
All right.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.168
Ellie does suit you.

11:09.376 --> 11:11.295
Spare me your pandering.

11:11.503 --> 11:15.299
I'm well beyond your usual
trust-building exercises.

11:15.507 --> 11:19.136
I agree, again.

11:19.344 --> 11:23.056
Then let's skip the formalities and
get straight into it, shall we?

11:23.265 --> 11:26.018
Into what?

11:26.226 --> 11:28.979
You are an analyst, are you not?

11:29.188 --> 11:31.440
I am.

11:31.648 --> 11:33.901
And you have my file?

11:34.109 --> 11:36.069
I do.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.988
And you've got nothing for me?

11:38.197 --> 11:40.282
No diagnosis?

11:40.490 --> 11:43.535
Well, perhaps I'm not
as perceptive as you.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.040
But, uh, to be honest,

11:48.248 --> 11:50.250
I haven't even read this.

11:53.378 --> 11:54.963
Is that right?

11:55.172 --> 11:56.840
Relax. He's bluffing.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.800
He wouldn't go in there blind.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.136
It ls.

12:01.345 --> 12:03.847
Is this common practice for you?

12:04.056 --> 12:07.559
Arriving woefully unprepared?

12:07.768 --> 12:12.272
If I had read this, it would have colored
my perception of you before we met.

12:12.481 --> 12:16.109
Now personally, I prefer to hear
from the individual in question

12:16.318 --> 12:20.113
rather than focusing on a
particular problem they have

12:20.322 --> 12:23.116
or mistake they made.

12:23.325 --> 12:27.412
Even if said individual is a
maladjusted prepubescent?

12:27.621 --> 12:30.165
All the more so with children,

12:30.374 --> 12:32.417
as they aren't usually
given enough credit

12:32.626 --> 12:37.756
when it comes to expressing
their own anxieties.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.675
I was right about you.

12:39.883 --> 12:42.928
You were right about
a lot of things.

12:43.136 --> 12:45.013
I have worked with children.

12:45.222 --> 12:48.350
Often from rough neighborhoods,

12:48.558 --> 12:51.478
and I'm not particularly
concerned with my hairstyle.

12:54.106 --> 12:57.484
I don't believe, however,
that qualifies me as a, uh,

12:57.693 --> 13:00.195
bargain bin find.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.822
The other shrinks
they brought me

13:02.030 --> 13:05.325
wore designer suits
and fancy watches.

13:10.080 --> 13:14.418
A watch is a, uh, funny
device these days.

13:16.044 --> 13:20.424
I have a friend who is
obsessed with fancy watches.

13:20.632 --> 13:22.467
Eventually, after
years of hard work,

13:22.676 --> 13:24.469
he rewarded himself with one.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.888
And it was beautiful.

13:27.097 --> 13:30.392
But the problem was
after about a week,

13:30.600 --> 13:32.936
it was nearly two minutes slow.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.147
He wound it, set it.

13:35.355 --> 13:38.275
Another week went
by, same problem.

13:38.483 --> 13:42.321
He was always losing time.

13:42.529 --> 13:46.199
Yeah, my father gave me

13:46.408 --> 13:51.121
this watch a long time ago.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.458
It's not flashy by any means.

13:54.666 --> 13:57.252
But I'll tell you what,
it's never lost a minute.

14:00.881 --> 14:04.551
Yeah, a time piece may
have aesthetic value.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.261
At its core, though,

14:06.470 --> 14:09.598
it is a single function device.

14:09.806 --> 14:11.266
Shiny or dull,

14:11.475 --> 14:14.478
all that matters is how
well it tells the time.

14:16.438 --> 14:19.649
And you can tell the time?

14:19.858 --> 14:23.695
Never lost a minute.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.656
You stand to lose more
than time in here.

14:28.825 --> 14:33.288
Well, I'm willing to take
that chance if you are.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.415
Perhaps.

14:40.712 --> 14:43.965
But certainly not on
an empty stomach.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.509
You hungry?

14:45.717 --> 14:48.095
Peanut butter and banana
on whole wheat with chips

14:48.303 --> 14:50.722
or celery.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.016
So specific.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.560
I take it with apple juice.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.149
I'll see what I can drum up.

15:01.358 --> 15:03.193
And Jimmy?

15:05.862 --> 15:07.823
No crust.

15:34.641 --> 15:39.187
I assume you have the means
to prepare Ellie's lunch.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.524
- Mccrosky.
- What the hell?

15:50.031 --> 15:52.492
What do you think?

15:52.701 --> 15:56.413
She's an extraordinary child.

15:56.621 --> 15:58.790
Well, perhaps this is
old hat for all of you,

15:58.999 --> 16:01.877
but you can't deny how
remarkable her intellect is.

16:02.085 --> 16:04.880
Her intellect is not what
concerns me, doctor.

16:05.088 --> 16:07.215
What does concern you?

16:07.424 --> 16:10.719
I'm more concerned with the
patient's personality disorders.

16:10.927 --> 16:12.387
Disorders?

16:12.596 --> 16:14.598
I think we can both
agree that she suffers

16:14.806 --> 16:16.975
from a severe
superiority complex.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.644
Well, given her
advanced intelligence,

16:19.853 --> 16:22.063
one might excuse some
feelings of superiority.

16:22.272 --> 16:25.150
Oh, not when it escalates to...

16:29.905 --> 16:33.033
You really didn't read the file.

16:33.241 --> 16:36.411
No. Like I, uh, told Ellie,

16:36.620 --> 16:39.956
I like to hear the individual's
version of things first.

16:42.375 --> 16:45.670
Professional
irresponsibility aside,

16:45.879 --> 16:47.380
I think you owe it to yourself

16:47.589 --> 16:50.217
to understand the violence
this patient is capable of.

16:50.425 --> 16:54.387
Well, I trust it'll become
clear in talking with Eleanor.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.432
We would prefer that it didn't.

16:57.641 --> 17:02.229
Man slave reporting for duty.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.525
You told me you were ready.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.319
And you told me you needed
someone with an open mind.

17:09.528 --> 17:13.073
Dr. Fonda, I have a
lot riding on this,

17:13.281 --> 17:17.368
and I don't like the feeling that
you're not taking it seriously.

17:17.577 --> 17:19.913
Everyone has a process, Olivia.

17:20.121 --> 17:22.790
Mine can rub people
the wrong way,

17:22.999 --> 17:25.460
but it is effective.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.630
I need you to trust me on that.

17:28.838 --> 17:32.759
Hey, doc, celery's not
gonna chop itself.

17:39.766 --> 17:42.227
So, uh, how long do you
think this is gonna take?

17:42.435 --> 17:44.604
'Cause, uh, I got a
hot date tonight,

17:44.813 --> 17:49.526
and I am, like, 85% sure that this girl
is a freak, you know what I'm saying?

17:49.734 --> 17:51.570
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm
not sure I follow.

17:51.778 --> 17:55.782
Uh, let's just say I plan on
dipping into the sauce, you know?

17:55.991 --> 17:59.327
I think what he's trying to ask is how
long you think your evaluation will last.

17:59.536 --> 18:03.707
Uh, hard to say. Ellie knows
why I'm here, which, uh,

18:03.915 --> 18:06.042
complicates my approach.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.337
How long does progress in a
case like this usually take?

18:11.464 --> 18:15.302
The walls are built high. They may
prove difficult to pull down.

18:17.429 --> 18:21.182
Well, a meal fit for a Princess.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.810
Or a spoiled little psycho.

18:44.247 --> 18:47.792
That looks like orange juice.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.210
You don't like orange juice?

18:49.419 --> 18:51.588
I said apple.

18:51.796 --> 18:54.215
I thought we might try
something different today.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.843
Juice is juice, I suppose.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.888
Excellent. Let me get
you started here.

19:00.096 --> 19:04.392
The situation would be much improved
for everyone if I can use my hands.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.604
I've been emphatically
warned against that.

19:07.812 --> 19:09.481
Open up now.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.907
I suppose you are more
comfortable with this?

19:19.115 --> 19:21.368
Servant of the
peasants that you are?

19:21.576 --> 19:25.497
You seem quite fixated
on socioeconomic status.

19:25.705 --> 19:31.086
I have had enough exposure to you
working-class folks to know what you are.

19:31.294 --> 19:32.504
What are we?

19:32.712 --> 19:35.674
A lost cause.

19:35.882 --> 19:40.595
I don't believe you're qualified to
condemn and entire class of people.

19:40.804 --> 19:43.848
The number of dumpy towns we
pass through might surprise you.

19:44.057 --> 19:47.060
We?

19:47.268 --> 19:48.812
My mother and I.

19:51.731 --> 19:54.150
I see.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.902
And your father?

19:56.111 --> 19:59.489
No one told you?

19:59.698 --> 20:02.033
Colonel birch is my father.

20:07.956 --> 20:11.126
That, uh, certainly
complicates things.

20:11.334 --> 20:13.503
The good colonel wasn't
around much, you see?

20:13.712 --> 20:15.797
Sounds rough.

20:16.005 --> 20:20.844
And you and your mother couldn't
settle into any of these dumpy towns?

20:21.052 --> 20:23.012
In spite of her deficiencies,

20:23.221 --> 20:26.057
she knew that if people
understood what I was capable of,

20:26.266 --> 20:30.061
I would end up in a
place like this.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.730
She didn't want that for you.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.775
Where is she now?

20:35.984 --> 20:37.694
She's dead.

20:37.902 --> 20:39.821
Oh.

20:40.029 --> 20:41.114
I'm sorry.

20:41.322 --> 20:43.950
Why?

20:44.159 --> 20:47.912
Because it sounds like
she loved you a lot.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.664
I don't like that term.

20:49.873 --> 20:52.625
"Love." it's vague, overused.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.335
How so?

20:54.544 --> 20:57.589
Love is the guise under
which selfishness operates.

20:57.797 --> 21:02.385
Parents only love their children so long
as they maintain control over them.

21:02.594 --> 21:06.014
And the other side of that,

21:06.222 --> 21:10.018
as a child, did you,
uh, love your mother?

21:10.226 --> 21:14.397
At one point, I was convinced the
affinity I felt for her was love.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.233
However, now I realize the
Harmony our lives shared

21:17.442 --> 21:20.028
was closer to what one might
share with a common house pet...

21:20.236 --> 21:22.822
A realization that
didn't make it easier

21:23.031 --> 21:26.242
when the time came
to put her down.

21:29.954 --> 21:31.790
Put her down?

21:31.998 --> 21:36.127
That's right. You should
have read your file, Jimmy.

21:39.672 --> 21:41.800
So, you, um...

21:42.008 --> 21:45.553
She had become more a hindrance
than the catalyst at that point.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.058
She was holding you back.

21:50.266 --> 21:51.643
That's right.

21:51.851 --> 21:54.145
I'm not sure I follow you.

21:54.354 --> 21:57.148
That doesn't surprise me.

21:57.357 --> 21:59.651
Were you ever in a place
like this with her around?

22:05.573 --> 22:09.661
I was under the impression ink blots
were out of favor in your community.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.999
A lot of people have
given up on them.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.836
Not you.

22:18.044 --> 22:21.506
Well, you find they still hold
value in certain situations.

22:21.714 --> 22:25.301
Let's try a few.

22:25.510 --> 22:29.681
I assumed you were beyond
such rudimentary techniques.

22:29.889 --> 22:33.434
Afraid you might not
like what I see?

22:33.643 --> 22:35.728
All right.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.773
I'm going to hold up a card. I
don't want you to think too...

22:38.982 --> 22:41.276
I know how it works.

22:42.986 --> 22:43.986
Right.

22:51.452 --> 22:54.330
Looks like a dog I found
on a street once.

22:55.623 --> 22:57.208
It had been run over,

22:57.417 --> 22:59.794
its blood running
into the gutter.

23:03.172 --> 23:05.383
World war <i>ll</i> gas chamber,

23:05.592 --> 23:08.303
naked emaciated
bodies piled high.

23:08.511 --> 23:10.305
Ugh. What the...?

23:13.725 --> 23:15.977
Oh, shit.

23:16.185 --> 23:19.188
Gotta take this.

23:21.524 --> 23:24.611
Hey, anybody else notice that
sudden rise in temperature?

23:24.819 --> 23:27.196
- They're removing
blackened gloves.

23:27.405 --> 23:29.782
But it's messy.
Blood everywhere.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.218
The girl is clearly
toying with him.

23:31.242 --> 23:33.161
Yeah, what is this guy?
An amateur?

23:33.369 --> 23:34.638
Well, she wouldn't
have brought him in a

23:34.650 --> 23:35.931
this point if she didn't
have a good reason.

23:35.955 --> 23:37.790
She's grasping at straws.

23:39.292 --> 23:42.378
That one looks just like
colonel birch's swollen eye.

23:42.587 --> 23:43.922
Shit.

23:44.130 --> 23:45.340
Oh, relax, colonel.

23:45.548 --> 23:47.228
Just a couple of more
hours and we're free.

23:47.383 --> 23:49.969
At the rate he's moving, we're
going to be here all night.

23:50.178 --> 23:53.014
All night? Well, pull him out of there.
We don't have time for this.

23:53.222 --> 23:56.327
A pack of chimpanzees tearing the
flesh off their young and eating it.

23:56.351 --> 23:59.687
Ryan has a point, colonel.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.376
We're moving in circles
with all this.

24:01.522 --> 24:04.233
This is agent price's little
experiment, not mine.

24:04.442 --> 24:07.002
Yeah? Well then, why doesn't she
just adopt the little antichrist

24:07.153 --> 24:09.739
- and let us off the hook?
- Give it a rest, mccrosky.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.383
- Judas hanging himself.
- If I miss this date,

24:11.407 --> 24:13.910
I am going to be very
unpleasant to work with.

24:14.118 --> 24:16.788
He has been disemboweled.

24:16.996 --> 24:19.457
His intestines dangle with him.

24:22.126 --> 24:25.588
- What do you think... about all this?
- Car accident.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.216
The driver has gone
through the windshield.

24:28.424 --> 24:32.136
His heart is pumping
blood onto the hood.

24:32.345 --> 24:35.390
We won't learn anything significant
about the patient this way.

24:35.598 --> 24:37.850
That one looks like
a battered woman.

24:38.059 --> 24:40.728
Actually it resembles
miss Olivia.

24:40.937 --> 24:44.482
Oh, here we go.
- She is bruised and scarred on her face.

24:44.691 --> 24:50.363
She is moving forward, but I see blood
running down her legs from under her skirt.

24:53.574 --> 24:57.078
What did I miss?

24:57.286 --> 24:59.580
It is you, Jimmy.

24:59.789 --> 25:03.126
You are sinking into
a bog of some kind.

25:03.334 --> 25:06.462
I'm not sure you are
going to make it out.

25:10.174 --> 25:13.136
- Last one?
- Mm-hmm.

25:15.013 --> 25:19.183
My mother's head split
down the middle.

25:19.392 --> 25:22.687
Blood trickling
down over her face.

25:28.317 --> 25:30.778
How did I do?

25:30.987 --> 25:33.239
There was a distinct
trend in your answers.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.658
You don't say?

25:35.867 --> 25:38.244
It's one of the reasons
I still like this test.

25:38.453 --> 25:41.622
Even if the subject is being
purposely disingenuous,

25:41.831 --> 25:43.875
patterns still arise
within their responses,

25:44.083 --> 25:47.086
which shed light on certain
aspects of the psyche.

25:47.295 --> 25:50.673
This should be interesting.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.551
The dark shapelessness
of the blot

25:53.760 --> 25:57.388
often leads people
to their own fears.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.682
I see.

25:59.891 --> 26:05.480
You, uh, specifically used the term
"blood" four times in ten cards.

26:05.688 --> 26:09.275
It was five times, actually.

26:09.484 --> 26:11.819
Does blood frighten you?

26:12.028 --> 26:14.989
- No.
- What do you fear?

26:15.198 --> 26:17.325
Only what I don't understand.

26:17.533 --> 26:19.118
So you understand blood?

26:19.327 --> 26:22.288
- Certainly.
- Do you have experience with it?

26:22.497 --> 26:24.665
- A little.
- Human blood?

26:24.874 --> 26:27.543
Enough to know it doesn't
make me squeamish.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.338
What about your mother's blood?

26:30.546 --> 26:32.340
That's the obvious encounter.

26:32.548 --> 26:34.258
Was your mother afraid of blood?

26:34.467 --> 26:35.885
Not that I'm aware of.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.136
Was she afraid of you?

26:37.345 --> 26:38.679
No.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.892
But she should have been.

26:47.814 --> 26:50.858
She believed the mundanities cf
everyday life could apply to me.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.820
Right, wrong, good, evil.

26:54.028 --> 26:58.282
The inventions of an
inferior breed of man.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.784
You're above all of that?

26:59.992 --> 27:03.121
My existence is elevated, yes.

27:03.329 --> 27:08.876
How does your, uh, current situation
factor into that elevation?

27:09.085 --> 27:12.213
My fate ends here,
it always has,

27:12.421 --> 27:14.215
no matter what
ideas of salvation

27:14.423 --> 27:16.759
you or anyone else
may have for me.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.513
What is it you need
salvation from?

27:23.516 --> 27:25.685
Miss Olivia.

27:25.893 --> 27:29.438
Naughty, naughty.

27:29.647 --> 27:31.983
Let me ask you a
question, Jimmy.

27:32.191 --> 27:33.776
What possible reason
could they have

27:33.985 --> 27:36.988
for strapping a nine-year-old
to a chair like this?

27:39.282 --> 27:42.535
What is it people do when they
happen upon something different?

27:42.743 --> 27:44.871
Something they can't comprehend?

27:47.206 --> 27:50.793
In there, they can't
comprehend me,

27:51.002 --> 27:52.378
and it terrifies them.

27:54.255 --> 27:56.674
But what if they were able
to get a closer look at me?

27:56.883 --> 27:59.218
Say at my brain chemistry?

27:59.427 --> 28:03.222
They might be able to understand
just how different I am.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.766
And how to control me.

28:05.975 --> 28:11.772
That warm blanket of comfort comes
at a relatively small cost.

28:11.981 --> 28:15.026
You aren't the first of your kind
miss Olivia has sent in here

28:15.234 --> 28:19.322
in an ill-fated attempt
to justify my existence.

28:19.530 --> 28:23.910
However, I am fairly certain

28:24.118 --> 28:26.120
you will be the last.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.171
Is it true?

28:35.379 --> 28:37.089
I thought if you
knew, then you...

28:37.298 --> 28:39.592
Is it true?

28:42.261 --> 28:45.348
It's all right, agent price.

28:45.556 --> 28:47.683
Dr. Fonda is a smart man.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.561
I'm sure he can see the
logic in our decision.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.443
You were going to
cut that girl open?

28:57.652 --> 28:59.070
Yes.

29:04.533 --> 29:06.327
I don't believe it.

29:06.535 --> 29:09.372
The patient's
assertions are correct.

29:09.580 --> 29:13.000
This mutation is something
the scientific community

29:13.209 --> 29:15.544
and the world can't
afford to ignore.

29:15.753 --> 29:19.548
The only way to be thorough
in such matters...

29:19.757 --> 29:23.386
Is from the inside out.

29:23.594 --> 29:26.597
That is worth her life?

29:26.806 --> 29:30.977
The threat she poses far
outweighs any potential benefit.

29:34.105 --> 29:36.315
And all of you condone this?

29:39.735 --> 29:41.862
That's right.

29:44.198 --> 29:48.119
You must understand none of us
are keen on euthanizing a minor.

29:48.327 --> 29:51.497
Euthanasia is a method
reserved for animals.

29:51.706 --> 29:52.873
Ellie's a child.

29:53.082 --> 29:56.585
No. My grandkids are children.

29:56.794 --> 30:02.425
That thing in there is nothing
more than a ticking time bomb.

30:02.633 --> 30:06.095
What is she capable of
that warrants this fear?

30:06.304 --> 30:09.098
That's classified information.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.976
Given the circumstances, I
believe I have a right to know.

30:12.184 --> 30:15.021
No. No, you don't.

30:18.941 --> 30:21.152
Eleanor can do things...

30:21.360 --> 30:24.363
That we've never seen before.

30:24.572 --> 30:27.116
Things that have
proven dangerous.

30:27.325 --> 30:30.578
Dangerous enough
to justify murder?

30:30.786 --> 30:33.080
Ask her mother.

30:36.125 --> 30:40.755
It is an extremely unfortunate situation.
No one is denying it.

30:40.963 --> 30:43.966
Each of the analysts I brought in
came away with the same conclusion.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.886
- Which is?
- Social detachment.

30:47.094 --> 30:50.598
Lack of empathy.
Manipulative tendencies.

30:50.806 --> 30:53.351
Girl is a sociopath.

30:53.559 --> 30:58.773
Her intellect only amplifies her
already troubling behavioral patterns.

30:58.981 --> 31:00.900
With all that intelligence,

31:01.108 --> 31:03.569
you don't find this suspicious
that she is telling us

31:03.778 --> 31:07.865
exactly what we need to hear
to draw that conclusion?

31:13.287 --> 31:15.289
How much time do I have?

31:15.498 --> 31:16.916
The execution is tomorrow.

31:23.422 --> 31:25.591
- Jimmy?
- I need a minute.

31:31.305 --> 31:34.141
Uh, this probably isn't
the best time, but, uh,

31:34.350 --> 31:37.061
I need to leave in,
like, 15 minutes, so...

31:54.495 --> 31:56.295
I realize I should have
been upfront with you,

31:56.497 --> 32:00.167
but I don't have time for
long-winded apologies right now.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.837
You don't have to play
the boss with me.

32:14.723 --> 32:18.227
We have been in that room day
in and day out for the year

32:18.436 --> 32:21.772
trying to figure out
what to make of her.

32:21.981 --> 32:24.108
And this is what you settled on?

32:28.112 --> 32:31.991
It's been several
months since this...

32:32.199 --> 32:35.703
Autopsy was proposed, and the
others' minds are made up.

32:35.911 --> 32:38.622
But the decision has
to be unanimous.

32:43.669 --> 32:46.338
Ellie's given me no reason
for my continues support.

32:46.547 --> 32:48.048
I can't hold them off any more.

32:51.010 --> 32:54.096
I agreed to change my vote

32:54.305 --> 32:57.975
if they gave me one last
chance to get through to her.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.562
Me.

33:04.940 --> 33:07.902
They don't see her for
what she is anymore.

33:08.110 --> 33:11.280
And if we don't make
them see, she dies.

33:15.451 --> 33:19.038
I'm sorry, Jimmy, but you're
the best chance I had.

33:27.505 --> 33:31.926
The guards took something
from me when I came in.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.471
I need to get it back.

33:45.981 --> 33:47.983
Thought I lost you for a minute.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.695
I'm not so easy to get rid of.

33:51.904 --> 33:54.448
Do you know chess?

33:54.657 --> 33:59.453
Are we resorting to such unorthodox
analytical methods already?

33:59.662 --> 34:02.331
Chess is my favorite game.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.250
I thought I might teach you.

34:04.458 --> 34:08.795
<i>I</i> doubt there's much of
anything you could teach me.

34:09.004 --> 34:11.130
Then you know how to play.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.132
I found the game quite boring.

34:13.342 --> 34:16.262
Within a week, I set speed records
against a master computer.

34:16.469 --> 34:18.639
Oh, there's your problem.

34:18.847 --> 34:20.306
You played against a computer.

34:20.516 --> 34:24.436
A game against a person
is much more stimulating.

34:24.645 --> 34:30.150
And I take it your vast psychological
prowess gives you an advantage.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.071
There's only one
way to find out.

34:39.618 --> 34:43.246
All right, but I'll
need my hands.

34:44.706 --> 34:46.500
Calling out the moves
is easy enough.

34:46.708 --> 34:50.295
I'll help you with the
rank and file, and...

34:50.504 --> 34:52.840
How do you expect your
patient to trust you

34:53.047 --> 34:55.009
if you won't trust her?

34:55.217 --> 34:59.430
We both know it's against
the rules, Ellie.

34:59.638 --> 35:03.642
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.282
Oh, boy.

35:18.490 --> 35:20.409
What does he think he is doing?

35:28.250 --> 35:30.252
Son of a bitch.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.254
Boom goes the dynamite.

35:32.463 --> 35:33.255
That's it. I'm
shutting him down.

35:33.464 --> 35:34.715
No, you're not.

35:34.923 --> 35:36.300
He's gonna get himself killed.

35:39.094 --> 35:40.971
Dr. Fonda knows what he's doing.

35:41.180 --> 35:45.142
- Actually, he doesn't.
- Ryan, ready the pulse.

35:45.351 --> 35:46.661
Colonel, you don't
have the authority...

35:46.685 --> 35:48.020
If this situation
becomes hostile,

35:48.228 --> 35:50.439
I do have the authority
to override your command.

35:50.648 --> 35:53.484
Ryan, the pulse. Now.

35:53.692 --> 35:56.403
Shit just got real.

36:22.179 --> 36:24.598
Are you waiting for something?

36:24.807 --> 36:27.726
Oh, no. Sorry.

36:32.981 --> 36:35.025
Here, let me move the
board so we ca...

36:40.114 --> 36:41.740
Your move.

36:48.580 --> 36:51.333
Yes, it would appear so.

37:03.721 --> 37:07.641
I've always found the early
moves to be the most important,

37:07.850 --> 37:10.936
and they shape the
face of the game.

37:11.145 --> 37:13.522
If you say so.

37:23.991 --> 37:26.744
You know, the computer
moved instantly.

37:28.078 --> 37:30.581
- And?
- And I was led to believe

37:30.789 --> 37:34.418
this would be a more
stimulating experience.

37:37.212 --> 37:41.717
Uh, stimulations lies
in the analysis.

37:41.925 --> 37:46.013
Chess is not a game of speed.

37:46.221 --> 37:48.807
Not for some, clearly.

37:53.812 --> 37:57.858
So why you? Now? After
all the stiffs?

37:58.066 --> 38:00.319
Is this a reevaluation?

38:00.527 --> 38:03.906
Perhaps I've, uh,
graduated from the, um,

38:04.114 --> 38:06.074
bargain bin to the sales rack.

38:06.283 --> 38:08.577
You're right.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.913
I shouldn't risk
slowing you down.

38:11.121 --> 38:13.791
No, I think I can multitask.

38:13.999 --> 38:17.961
You know, agent price and I were
schoolmates at university. That's where...

38:18.170 --> 38:20.756
You were schoolmates, huh?

38:20.964 --> 38:22.549
Mm-hmm.

38:22.758 --> 38:27.221
And that's why she was keeping
such close tabs on you?

38:27.429 --> 38:29.431
What is it you're implying?

38:29.640 --> 38:33.894
Simply put, miss Olivia is a
reasonably attractive woman

38:34.102 --> 38:36.063
for her age.

38:36.271 --> 38:41.026
I'm sure that at university,
she was quite a dish.

38:41.235 --> 38:44.363
I can only imagine the
canoodling that took place.

38:49.827 --> 38:53.330
Eyes forward, gentlemen.

38:53.539 --> 38:55.999
Sorry to, uh,
disappoint, Eleanor,

38:56.208 --> 38:59.253
but I don't canoodle and tell.

38:59.461 --> 39:03.090
And what would your wife think of
this liaison with an old flame?

39:03.298 --> 39:07.678
I don't think my wife would
think anything of it any more.

39:07.886 --> 39:11.265
You don't realistically
expect her to return, do you?

39:11.473 --> 39:16.812
No. That, um, that part
of my life is over.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.939
Really?

39:22.526 --> 39:24.778
King without his queen.

39:27.531 --> 39:28.991
Check.

39:31.827 --> 39:33.912
Perhaps you can answer me this.

39:34.121 --> 39:38.208
Why is it always trinkets when someone
wants to hold on to the past?

39:41.211 --> 39:46.258
My mother, she used to
wear this little trinket.

39:46.466 --> 39:48.176
What was it?

39:48.385 --> 39:52.097
It was this inane fox pendant
I made when I was very young.

39:54.808 --> 39:57.185
And, uh, that bothered you?

39:57.394 --> 40:00.355
It was crude. Rudimentary.

40:00.564 --> 40:04.943
In spite of my obvious talents, it was that
she insisted on displaying to the world.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.364
Do you know why she wore it?

40:09.573 --> 40:13.410
She told me I was very
proud of the piece.

40:13.619 --> 40:17.789
It was the only reminder
I was ever just a child.

40:17.998 --> 40:21.460
Physical manifestation of
my being in a lesser from.

40:23.086 --> 40:26.340
I doubt there was so
much analysis involved.

40:26.548 --> 40:31.595
All this ring does for me is remind me
of the joy I experienced with my family.

40:34.848 --> 40:38.352
I think she wore it to remind
herself how much she loved you.

40:50.364 --> 40:55.911
You should worry less about love and
more about the hole you are in.

40:56.119 --> 40:58.872
I don't see what hole you mean.

40:59.081 --> 41:02.793
You must be blind. I have
complete control of the board.

41:06.546 --> 41:10.258
Just by nature's defensive game,

41:10.467 --> 41:13.512
to protect what is
important, we build walls.

41:13.720 --> 41:18.392
But I can understand how and why
my opponent builds their walls up.

41:18.600 --> 41:22.270
It gives me an advantage when
I want to break them down.

41:22.479 --> 41:26.775
At that point, what matters isn't
the quantity of pieces you take,

41:26.984 --> 41:29.945
but the quality of those you do.

41:30.153 --> 41:34.533
Check... mate.

41:56.138 --> 41:58.306
No!

41:58.515 --> 42:00.058
Hit the pulse, Ryan.

42:00.267 --> 42:01.619
- Wait.
- If that wasn't hostile, I don't know...

42:01.643 --> 42:02.978
Look.

42:15.699 --> 42:18.994
Another game.

42:19.202 --> 42:21.246
No.

42:22.998 --> 42:25.000
Afraid you might not
be so lucky this time?

42:26.501 --> 42:28.587
I'm not afraid to lose.

42:28.795 --> 42:33.717
But if I did, I certainly hope I
would do it with a bit more grace.

42:39.931 --> 42:42.350
- What the hell do you think this is?
- Birch!

42:42.559 --> 42:45.413
Do you think this is a game or are you too
stupid to know what's good for you, huh?

42:45.437 --> 42:47.189
Colonel, this is unacceptable.

42:47.397 --> 42:50.233
This son of a bitch put every single
person in this compound in danger.

42:50.442 --> 42:51.693
You call that acceptable?

42:51.902 --> 42:53.546
This situation called
for extreme action.

42:53.570 --> 42:55.238
Disobeying a direct
order is inexcusable.

42:55.447 --> 42:58.366
- Spare me your orders!
- No, no, no, no.

42:58.575 --> 43:00.994
The colonel is... is right.

43:01.203 --> 43:05.082
The rules are in place for a
reason, and I violated them.

43:05.290 --> 43:08.335
For that, I apologize.

43:08.543 --> 43:12.047
We, uh, do, however,
need drastic results,

43:12.255 --> 43:16.426
and I'm not going to get them
with a set of ink blots.

43:18.345 --> 43:20.430
I hope it was worth it.

43:24.101 --> 43:28.480
Do you, um, have access to
Ellie's mother's effects?

43:28.688 --> 43:30.273
Yeah.

43:30.482 --> 43:32.275
I'll need to see them.

43:40.992 --> 43:43.411
You know, doctor, we
all have to thank you.

43:43.620 --> 43:48.250
That little stunt you pulled in there
proved how volatile the patient is.

43:48.458 --> 43:50.335
I didn't see it that way.

43:50.544 --> 43:53.505
There's no denying the threatening
nature of that outburst.

43:53.713 --> 43:58.218
I'm sure we've all seen a child
throw a temper tantrum before.

43:58.426 --> 44:02.514
Not one that ripped a steel
table clean off its bolts, no.

44:02.722 --> 44:04.099
You only saw her reaction.

44:04.307 --> 44:05.934
You didn't see how
she played the game.

44:06.143 --> 44:08.311
Oh, this should be good.

44:08.520 --> 44:12.858
Please, enlighten us
on what we missed.

44:13.066 --> 44:16.278
It's small moves that determine
the outcome in chess.

44:16.486 --> 44:20.615
Ellie was in control and had
the opportunity to finish me,

44:20.824 --> 44:23.326
but it meant
sacrificing her queen.

44:23.535 --> 44:27.831
She didn't make the move. She
chose to protect her queen.

44:28.039 --> 44:32.544
Okay. So the kid sucks at chess?

44:34.421 --> 44:37.674
I believe that Ellie
subconsciously linked her queen,

44:37.883 --> 44:39.718
that trinket,

44:39.926 --> 44:42.012
to the memory of her mother.

44:45.182 --> 44:47.267
- Wow.
- What a joke.

44:47.475 --> 44:50.478
We don't have to stand here and listen
to this bullshit. Can we call this?

44:50.687 --> 44:52.647
It was an elementary move.

44:52.856 --> 44:56.860
One that someone with Ellie's
intellectual prowess wouldn't pass up.

44:57.068 --> 44:59.571
Could be a mistake.

44:59.779 --> 45:02.157
Even geniuses make mistakes.

45:02.365 --> 45:04.326
It wasn't a mistake.

45:09.706 --> 45:11.833
The child made several
counterintuitive moves,

45:12.042 --> 45:14.628
each of which
protected her queen.

45:14.836 --> 45:16.922
Not that it validates
the girl's reaction,

45:17.130 --> 45:20.217
but Dr. Fonda's proposed
attachment to the piece is,

45:20.425 --> 45:23.678
well, not entirely
without merit.

45:23.887 --> 45:26.056
Thank you, doctor.

45:26.264 --> 45:28.808
Fine, the kid loves queens.
Take her to a drag show.

45:29.017 --> 45:30.936
I have to agree.
That proves nothing.

45:31.144 --> 45:34.981
Dr. Keaton, what is the one
thing a sociopath lacks?

45:35.190 --> 45:38.944
Uh, empathy.

45:39.152 --> 45:40.153
Attachments.

45:40.362 --> 45:41.947
Uh-huh.

45:42.155 --> 45:45.700
I gleaned much more from the
way Ellie played the game

45:45.909 --> 45:47.577
then the way she
responded to losing it.

45:47.786 --> 45:49.306
And we're all thrilled
for you, doctor.

45:49.412 --> 45:51.915
We're talking about a threat
to national security.

45:59.172 --> 46:01.967
The girl's reaction is in
line with all previous data.

46:02.175 --> 46:05.303
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's get the hell out of here.

46:05.512 --> 46:08.473
I need more time.

46:08.682 --> 46:11.393
We're all in agreement.
Your time is up.

46:13.937 --> 46:15.522
Hold on.

46:23.321 --> 46:26.408
I think it's worth giving Dr.
Fonda another chance.

46:26.616 --> 46:28.618
- What?
- You got to be kidding me.

46:28.827 --> 46:31.162
I don't know if it will
make a difference,

46:31.371 --> 46:33.456
but he has progressed much
further than the others.

46:33.665 --> 46:35.917
By risking the security
of this entire compound.

46:36.126 --> 46:38.586
I will not stand idly by and
allow that to happen again.

46:38.795 --> 46:40.046
That is not your call, colonel.

46:40.255 --> 46:41.589
Oh, you don't think so?

46:41.798 --> 46:44.217
I'd say that last outburst
was contentious enough.

46:44.426 --> 46:47.220
And how contentious
is the situation now?

46:50.098 --> 46:51.808
If you're gonna play that card,

46:52.017 --> 46:54.477
you better be damn sure
you're able to justify it.

46:56.730 --> 47:00.275
Let's not forget that that
is a killer in there.

47:00.483 --> 47:02.753
I'm starting to think that
this may have to end in blood

47:02.777 --> 47:04.863
for you to acknowledge
her as such.

47:22.505 --> 47:25.925
Olivia, she's lost.

47:26.134 --> 47:28.678
And she's angry.

47:28.887 --> 47:30.722
But she is in there.

47:34.267 --> 47:36.811
Give me time. I'll find her.

47:50.909 --> 47:52.619
Feeling better?

47:57.248 --> 47:59.501
We made quite a mess, didn't we?

48:09.260 --> 48:12.847
A bit off the top,
but no harm done.

48:18.311 --> 48:21.773
Can't say the same
for your file.

48:36.454 --> 48:38.498
You know, you could be a
big help if you wanted.

48:38.706 --> 48:41.042
That might constitute a threat.

48:59.769 --> 49:02.147
I'm beginning to understand
why your wife left you.

49:02.355 --> 49:04.149
You don't say?

49:04.357 --> 49:07.110
Your persistence,
it's intolerable.

49:09.446 --> 49:12.115
Late nights in the slums
instead of dinner at home.

49:12.323 --> 49:14.826
That's the kind of thing
that poisons a marriage.

49:15.034 --> 49:16.714
I'm afraid we don't
have time to discuss...

49:16.870 --> 49:19.497
Correction.

49:19.706 --> 49:22.167
You don't have time.

49:24.878 --> 49:26.421
Must we play this game?

49:26.629 --> 49:28.173
Children like games.

49:28.381 --> 49:32.802
If you don't want to play,
the door is right there.

49:33.011 --> 49:34.596
I know where it is.

49:40.310 --> 49:42.103
Hold on.

49:43.813 --> 49:46.649
Do you see that?

49:46.858 --> 49:49.861
It looks different from before.

49:50.069 --> 49:53.990
It looks like your wife, yes?

49:54.199 --> 49:57.243
She's at home, tucked into bed.

49:57.452 --> 50:00.246
With a new man.

50:00.455 --> 50:03.124
If you turn it this way,

50:03.333 --> 50:05.502
it's a bit more abstract.

50:05.710 --> 50:10.173
It's your ideals, the same
persistence that tore you two apart.

50:31.402 --> 50:34.656
Work wasn't the
reason my wife left.

50:36.449 --> 50:38.535
Tell me more.

50:40.411 --> 50:42.497
We lost a child.

50:44.207 --> 50:46.125
Our daughter.

50:46.334 --> 50:48.211
Several years ago.

50:50.046 --> 50:51.839
And, uh,

50:52.048 --> 50:55.843
my wife didn't cope
well with her death.

50:56.052 --> 50:58.012
Eventually, she left.

51:00.890 --> 51:02.850
Now we are getting somewhere.

51:03.059 --> 51:04.811
Tell me what happened.

51:06.521 --> 51:10.858
She was playing in the
yard and was hit by a car.

51:11.067 --> 51:12.986
Oof, damn.

51:15.071 --> 51:16.823
Was it quick?

51:18.950 --> 51:22.161
No. She was very strong.

51:22.370 --> 51:24.789
And you were there, by her side?

51:26.124 --> 51:28.042
Every day.

51:28.251 --> 51:31.212
But you couldn't save her.

51:31.421 --> 51:32.880
No.

51:33.089 --> 51:36.426
And that was when you started
working with children.

51:36.634 --> 51:39.345
More so, yes.

51:39.554 --> 51:43.433
And consequently, why
you are here now.

51:43.641 --> 51:45.935
I am here to help you, Ellie.

51:46.144 --> 51:48.271
It isn't really
about me, though.

51:48.479 --> 51:50.315
It's about the return rate.

51:50.523 --> 51:52.567
You think that if you
can save enough of us,

51:52.775 --> 51:55.361
lt'll wash away your own pain.

51:55.570 --> 51:57.405
It's pathetic.

52:06.247 --> 52:07.957
Inn:

52:08.166 --> 52:12.003
Doubt there's anything more painful
than losing someone we love.

52:15.298 --> 52:18.676
I remember combing through
the events of that day

52:18.885 --> 52:23.306
a hundred times trying
to make sense of it.

52:23.514 --> 52:28.895
I was so overwhelmed by the feeling
that her death was my fault.

52:29.103 --> 52:32.732
Rightly so. She was
yours to protect.

52:32.940 --> 52:35.443
Yeah, I believed that
for a long time.

52:38.029 --> 52:41.574
It was easier for
me to punish myself

52:41.783 --> 52:44.786
than to accept that I
was somehow powerless.

52:47.455 --> 52:51.000
Running from that truth...

52:51.209 --> 52:54.337
Is what makes us
believe these things.

52:54.545 --> 52:59.717
Things that... lead us
down a destructive path.

53:04.389 --> 53:06.265
Takes a...

53:06.474 --> 53:09.644
A different kind of
courage to stop running.

53:09.852 --> 53:12.897
To face that truth.

53:17.610 --> 53:21.906
The pain may never
go away completely.

53:22.115 --> 53:25.535
But if you let go of the guilt,

53:25.743 --> 53:28.621
it does get better.

53:46.556 --> 53:50.226
Did the colonel ever tell you
how he got that nasty scar?

53:51.811 --> 53:54.564
I'm not interested in...

53:54.772 --> 53:57.358
Birch really is the epitome
of what I despise in people.

53:59.777 --> 54:02.196
So set in his antiquated ways.

54:02.405 --> 54:04.699
He can't see he's
spent his entire life

54:04.907 --> 54:07.618
marching to the beat of
someone else's drum.

54:07.827 --> 54:10.705
Sticks and stones, colonel.

54:10.913 --> 54:13.207
When I first arrived,

54:13.416 --> 54:16.711
he was determined to be the one to
access the potential locked within me.

54:18.838 --> 54:21.549
After dozens of
unsuccessful probes,

54:21.758 --> 54:23.342
his frustration ballooned.

54:26.012 --> 54:28.222
One day, he unbound me.

54:31.517 --> 54:35.521
Pulled out a pen
just like this one.

54:37.690 --> 54:40.067
He told me he wasn't afraid.

54:40.276 --> 54:44.030
That he didn't believe I had
any control over my power.

54:45.948 --> 54:48.034
You don't have to
do this, Ellie.

54:49.660 --> 54:51.788
I wonder...

54:51.996 --> 54:53.247
If he is afraid now.

55:04.175 --> 55:05.551
Ellie?

55:05.760 --> 55:06.761
Can you hear me?

55:09.597 --> 55:11.474
Olivia, what's happening?

55:11.682 --> 55:12.850
That's enough.

55:15.269 --> 55:17.188
That was unnecessary.

55:17.396 --> 55:20.399
It was a warning. The
patient knows the rules.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.239
Ellie, can I help you?

55:26.447 --> 55:29.992
No, you can't. None of you can.

55:30.201 --> 55:31.744
You pushed them, Ellie.

55:31.953 --> 55:34.539
Now you're on their side?

55:34.747 --> 55:36.749
- Here, let... let's...
- Get off me!

55:36.958 --> 55:38.751
- Let me at Lea...
- I said get off!

55:40.545 --> 55:43.923
That's it! 50%.

56:17.206 --> 56:21.377
Holy shit.

56:21.586 --> 56:23.170
I see you, colonel.

56:26.632 --> 56:29.802
75%, mccrosky.

56:47.069 --> 56:49.447
I don't wonder anymore.

56:49.655 --> 56:52.575
I know you are afraid.

56:52.783 --> 56:54.660
- Give her everything.
- No. It'll kill her.

56:54.869 --> 56:56.913
What is it you think
she plans to do to us?

56:57.121 --> 56:58.414
- Crank it, Ryan.
- Don't.

56:58.623 --> 57:00.750
Agent price is no
longer in command.

57:05.755 --> 57:07.673
Now!

57:37.286 --> 57:40.414
You okay?

57:40.623 --> 57:41.958
I'll live.

57:42.166 --> 57:44.085
What happened?

57:46.921 --> 57:50.758
She's been prepped and
is awaiting transport.

57:50.967 --> 57:54.011
Transport? Where?

57:58.683 --> 58:00.726
But she's still here now.

58:00.935 --> 58:02.186
Fonda-.

58:02.395 --> 58:03.995
If I could just get a
few more minutes...

58:04.146 --> 58:06.816
I'm afraid I'm no longer
the authority here.

58:08.359 --> 58:10.027
There must be some
way we can, uh,

58:10.236 --> 58:12.697
appeal to your superiors.

58:12.905 --> 58:17.118
I have poured almost all of my
professional credibility into that room.

58:19.078 --> 58:21.497
I got to take the little I
have left to walk away.

58:21.706 --> 58:23.290
The facade was crumbling.

58:23.499 --> 58:25.376
Doesn't matter. Not after that.

58:25.584 --> 58:27.503
Everyone in the control
room must have seen it.

58:27.712 --> 58:30.089
- If... if we were...
- Jimmy.

58:31.132 --> 58:32.633
It's over.

58:42.059 --> 58:44.103
Her mother's effects.

58:50.860 --> 58:53.696
I'm sorry I got you
caught up in all this.

58:59.160 --> 59:01.495
I heard about your daughter.

59:03.414 --> 59:09.378
Yeah. That was a very
dark time for me.

59:10.963 --> 59:15.009
Yet, um, every year since,

59:15.217 --> 59:19.513
I've become more convinced that
it's those moments that define us.

59:21.807 --> 59:23.934
That our struggles are...

59:24.143 --> 59:28.355
Simply questions life asks.

59:28.564 --> 59:32.693
At the end, all that
matters is how we answer.

59:42.870 --> 59:46.290
You're just the way
I remember you.

59:46.499 --> 59:48.542
You aren't so
different yourself.

59:48.751 --> 59:50.586
You were the boss then, too.

59:55.549 --> 01:00:01.013
Why was it you, um,
thought to call me?

01:00:01.222 --> 01:00:05.476
I knew you had been working
with kids ever since...

01:00:05.684 --> 01:00:07.520
What happened.

01:00:07.728 --> 01:00:12.858
Anyway, when all this
came up, I, um...

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:14.527
Inn:

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:19.949
You found yourself in a position

01:00:20.157 --> 01:00:22.660
to help a little girl.

01:00:25.246 --> 01:00:27.373
Yeah.

01:00:29.333 --> 01:00:32.419
Anyway, I've spent the
last year of my life

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:36.632
throwing away everything
I've worked for for nothing.

01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:44.140
I don't know. I couldn't, um...

01:00:44.348 --> 01:00:48.519
I couldn't just...
Stand by and, um...

01:00:48.727 --> 01:00:50.437
Let that girl die.

01:00:57.528 --> 01:00:59.822
Maybe you won't have to.

01:01:14.795 --> 01:01:17.756
Would you look who
is up and about.

01:01:21.468 --> 01:01:24.096
- What the hell does
he think he's doing?

01:01:24.305 --> 01:01:27.558
He needs another chance.

01:01:27.766 --> 01:01:30.311
Another chance?
What's going on here?

01:01:30.519 --> 01:01:33.397
Colonel was clear. He said
nobody goes in, nobody goes out.

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:35.524
And where is birch now?

01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:37.318
Now those were strict orders.

01:01:37.526 --> 01:01:39.337
Yeah, I don't know about you,
but I can't get fired again.

01:01:39.361 --> 01:01:41.614
Fired? We're talking treason.

01:01:41.822 --> 01:01:45.075
I'll take full responsibility.
Tell him I forced you.

01:01:45.284 --> 01:01:47.661
Do you really think
he's gonna buy that?

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:50.539
Agent price?

01:01:54.335 --> 01:01:56.295
I know this is hard.

01:01:56.503 --> 01:01:59.590
Maybe we need to accept that colonel
birch is doing the right thing.

01:01:59.798 --> 01:02:02.218
We all witnessed how
violently Ellie responded.

01:02:02.426 --> 01:02:03.719
To provocation.

01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:05.930
Does that make her
any less dangerous?

01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:17.024
I saw something
before that response.

01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:22.196
A crack in the persona Ellie has
spent so much time building.

01:02:22.404 --> 01:02:24.865
And I know both of
you saw it, too.

01:02:28.369 --> 01:02:31.789
We are sending that girl to die.

01:02:31.997 --> 01:02:34.500
If there's even the slightest
chance that she can be saved,

01:02:34.708 --> 01:02:36.543
I think it's a
chance worth taking.

01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:42.841
I just... I'm not sure we can.

01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:49.348
Thank you.

01:02:49.556 --> 01:02:52.059
Well, missed my date anyway.

01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:59.316
I hope you're right about this.

01:02:59.525 --> 01:03:00.943
Me, too.

01:03:08.158 --> 01:03:10.286
The hour is lit, doctor.

01:03:12.705 --> 01:03:15.499
This won't change anything.

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.043
It is worth trying.

01:03:18.252 --> 01:03:20.170
And if you succeed,

01:03:20.379 --> 01:03:22.589
what then?

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:24.925
Ellie gets a chance at life.

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:27.136
What kind of life?

01:03:27.344 --> 01:03:28.762
Life in a cage?

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:31.890
Never knowing any existence
beyond isolation?

01:03:33.642 --> 01:03:36.854
Given what humanity
stands to gain,

01:03:37.062 --> 01:03:39.857
the solution is
mutually beneficial.

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.485
I don't see it that way.

01:03:43.694 --> 01:03:46.488
<i>That's unfortunate.</i>

01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:49.241
I'm afraid the colonel does.

01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:03.797
It's about time.

01:04:08.886 --> 01:04:10.554
Eleanor.

01:04:15.517 --> 01:04:17.853
Ever the idealist, aren't we?

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:24.151
I see now why miss Olivia was so
keen to acquire your services,

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.946
besides her obvious desire to
rekindle an old flame, that is.

01:04:28.155 --> 01:04:30.699
We don't have much time, Ellie.

01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:33.619
Looks to me like you're
already out of time.

01:04:43.295 --> 01:04:46.673
I need you to tell me what
happened to your mother.

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:50.302
Read the file, James.
It's all there.

01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:52.388
I want to hear it from you.

01:04:52.596 --> 01:04:57.393
Too bad. I'm far too consumed
with my own execution.

01:04:59.144 --> 01:05:01.855
That's a shame.

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:05.150
I'm gonna be in big trouble
for breaking in here.

01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:07.528
So leave.

01:05:07.736 --> 01:05:10.447
No, I'll just, uh, wait.

01:05:10.656 --> 01:05:13.909
You know, maybe birch will
let me accompany you.

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:16.036
You know he won't.

01:05:20.332 --> 01:05:23.043
What ls it you want to know?

01:05:25.546 --> 01:05:27.423
Just what happened.

01:05:27.631 --> 01:05:29.216
I killed her...

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:31.343
In cold blood.

01:05:32.386 --> 01:05:35.055
That doesn't seem logical.

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:37.933
She was the person who
cared for you most.

01:05:38.142 --> 01:05:40.018
There's your problem.

01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:43.063
Your perspective is clouded by the
cumbersome weight of emotion,

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:45.858
without which, my logic
is perfectly sound.

01:05:50.028 --> 01:05:51.297
What the hell is going on here?

01:05:51.321 --> 01:05:52.698
Colonel, it was my call.

01:05:52.906 --> 01:05:55.325
I will personally see to
it that you burn for this.

01:05:55.534 --> 01:05:57.411
That's fine. This isn't
about me or you.

01:05:57.619 --> 01:06:00.122
I need three men and a ram now.

01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:02.684
Colonel, please just let him have
a chance... - Enough! Sit down.

01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:04.626
- What do you mean?
- Or what?

01:06:04.835 --> 01:06:06.595
Or you will have a much
less comfortable seat

01:06:06.753 --> 01:06:08.589
for the remainder of
this demonstration.

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:11.800
<i>I</i> don't think <i>I</i> can get into
your head if <i>I</i> wanted to.

01:06:12.009 --> 01:06:13.987
Maybe you think you can
change things around.

01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:15.371
Until you get the
results you seek.

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:17.514
This is over. Ryan,
hit her with a pulse.

01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:18.825
- No.
- That is just not true.

01:06:18.849 --> 01:06:20.184
Excuse me?

01:06:20.392 --> 01:06:22.436
It's still charging from
the power overload.

01:06:22.644 --> 01:06:25.147
How long?

01:06:25.355 --> 01:06:28.435
Uh, three minutes. - You still have
yet to tell me what you do think.

01:06:28.567 --> 01:06:30.736
I think you're lying, Ellie.

01:06:30.944 --> 01:06:34.031
To me, to everyone else.

01:06:34.239 --> 01:06:36.575
To yourself.

01:06:36.783 --> 01:06:38.744
Is that your diagnosis?

01:06:38.952 --> 01:06:41.330
That I'm a liar?

01:06:41.538 --> 01:06:44.875
No. I think you're lying
because you feel guilty.

01:06:47.669 --> 01:06:50.964
I think you loved your
mother very much.

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:53.008
Back to love again, are we?

01:06:54.801 --> 01:06:58.222
It must be easy to hide behind
an intellect so powerful.

01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:00.432
I'm not hiding.

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:03.685
How did it happen?

01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:05.062
I told you.

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:06.730
Was it an accident?

01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:08.398
Like with me earlier?

01:07:08.607 --> 01:07:10.734
No. I murdered her.

01:07:10.943 --> 01:07:14.029
I meant to do it, and
I'd do it again.

01:07:14.238 --> 01:07:16.073
All so you would end up here?

01:07:16.281 --> 01:07:19.368
Correct.

01:07:19.576 --> 01:07:21.495
So you killed her

01:07:21.703 --> 01:07:23.789
in insure your own death.

01:07:23.997 --> 01:07:27.376
My actions simply
expedited the inevitable.

01:07:30.087 --> 01:07:32.381
Then why not take
care of it yourself?

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:37.177
Deny them the pleasure
of cutting you open.

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:39.137
You'd prefer I had?

01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:42.641
No, but it would have made
more sense given your, uh,

01:07:42.849 --> 01:07:44.685
self-destructive agenda.

01:07:44.893 --> 01:07:46.562
You must have known this process

01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:48.730
would involve a great
deal of deliberation.

01:07:48.939 --> 01:07:51.024
There was no rush.

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:53.527
So you were resolved
to suffer through

01:07:53.735 --> 01:07:55.279
the psychological scrutiny.

01:07:55.487 --> 01:07:59.950
I wasn't going to deny myself
a last vestige of fun.

01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:04.913
Maybe you thought one of these
experts could help you.

01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:07.708
I assure you that thought
never crossed my mind.

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:11.211
Were you afraid?

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:14.006
Of what?

01:08:14.214 --> 01:08:17.593
Behind all your understanding,

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:21.179
is there no fear of
your own mortality?

01:08:21.388 --> 01:08:23.432
I'm not afraid to die.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.559
I believe you.

01:08:25.767 --> 01:08:29.270
I think you're afraid to
live with yourself...

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:31.857
After what happened.

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:43.160
I'm not afraid of anything.

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:45.578
One minute.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:47.997
Colonel?

01:08:48.206 --> 01:08:50.685
When it's hot, you fire up. - You can't
afford to keep doing this, Ellie.

01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:53.420
Neither of us have the time.

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:56.631
Finally. Something
we can agree on.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.760
Time's up.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.764
You have everyone fooled, Ellie.

01:09:03.971 --> 01:09:06.725
But when I lock at you, I still
see a scared little girl.

01:09:06.933 --> 01:09:08.727
Then you are blind.

01:09:08.935 --> 01:09:10.812
This numbness,

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.398
this anxiousness
to hurt yourself,

01:09:13.607 --> 01:09:16.693
all feelings we experience
in times of trauma.

01:09:16.902 --> 01:09:19.738
Like losing someone you love.

01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:24.326
I've heard enough about love.

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:29.706
You have given in.

01:09:29.915 --> 01:09:34.127
You let guilt turn your
wonderful gifts against you.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.296
I said enough.

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:38.048
Do you miss her?

01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:40.133
You still wake up in
the night, don't you?

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:42.135
- Shut up.
- Do you call out to her?

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:44.697
Shut up! - You're still expecting
she'll come and hold you.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.139
Shut up!

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.067
Do it.

01:09:57.275 --> 01:09:58.652
What are you waiting for?

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:01.988
I... can't.

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:04.032
It's her.

01:10:10.163 --> 01:10:12.332
What if you can't tell the time?

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:14.710
After all,

01:10:14.918 --> 01:10:17.879
what if my disdain for
humanity's inferior existence

01:10:18.088 --> 01:10:19.548
was becoming too much for me...

01:10:19.756 --> 01:10:23.593
- And my self-destruction
was an act of mercy?

01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:25.721
What if your
provocation backfires

01:10:25.929 --> 01:10:27.848
and convinces me to
turn on both sides?

01:10:29.975 --> 01:10:34.396
To become the monster they
would so like me to be?

01:10:42.279 --> 01:10:45.657
You decide what you become.

01:10:52.664 --> 01:10:54.958
Where did you get that?

01:11:23.236 --> 01:11:24.863
Clear! Move in!

01:11:43.131 --> 01:11:46.009
It was my fault.

01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:48.136
I didn't mean it.

01:11:50.013 --> 01:11:51.431
I know.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.684
I know. It was an accident.

01:12:02.025 --> 01:12:04.945
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:27.342
It's all right, Ellie.

01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:29.803
Everything is gonna
be all right.

01:13:52.469 --> 01:13:54.471
Check.

01:14:07.359 --> 01:14:10.111
I only have so much time
away from the facility.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.406
I'd prefer to make
the most of it.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:16.201
Chess is not a game of speed.

01:14:17.744 --> 01:14:19.704
So I've heard.

01:14:24.918 --> 01:14:28.964
Perhaps you could benefit from a
little practice in your free time.

01:14:29.172 --> 01:14:31.508
Free time?

01:14:31.716 --> 01:14:34.594
Dr. Werner isn't working
you too hard, I hope.

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:37.180
He's having trouble keeping up.

01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:43.812
How's agent price?

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.647
Pardon?

01:14:45.855 --> 01:14:47.649
I haven't seen her around.

01:14:47.857 --> 01:14:49.818
I thought maybe you had.

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:53.154
She's, um,

01:14:53.363 --> 01:14:55.031
she's fine.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.159
I'll give her your regards.

01:14:58.368 --> 01:15:01.871
Careful, doctor,
you're slipping.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.665
I'm not so sure about that.

01:15:06.292 --> 01:15:08.169
Check.
