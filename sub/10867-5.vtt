Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

00:42.167 --> 00:43.544
Hi guys!

00:43.544 --> 00:46.046
Hey, this looks...
dull.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.548
Staring contest.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.091
They've been going
for ten minutes.

00:49.091 --> 00:51.176
[creaking noise]
What was that?

00:51.176 --> 00:54.513
What is it...?
Yeah! I win! Alright!

00:54.513 --> 00:56.933
No fair!
I was distracted.

00:56.933 --> 01:00.102
So was I!
But I didn't move, so I win!

01:00.102 --> 01:01.980
Sorry Vange.

01:01.980 --> 01:03.272
Do over!

01:03.272 --> 01:05.566
No do-over.
Victory is mine!

01:05.566 --> 01:06.943
Tucker!?!

01:06.943 --> 01:09.904
Sorry. He's right.

01:09.904 --> 01:11.656
Yes!!

01:11.656 --> 01:14.617
But... winning isn't always
such a great thing you know.

01:14.617 --> 01:15.827
Yeah, when's that?

01:15.827 --> 01:17.912
When you get so
obsessed with it,

01:17.912 --> 01:21.791
that you don't see
what the real game is.

01:21.791 --> 01:24.251
That's what my story's about.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.462
Imagine a game you love to play.

01:26.462 --> 01:29.882
A game you're so good
at that you never lose.

01:29.882 --> 01:32.551
But then imagine if
winning this game,

01:32.551 --> 01:34.303
really meant...
losing.

01:34.303 --> 01:35.888
Say what?

01:35.888 --> 01:39.558
This is a story about
rules turned upside down,

01:39.558 --> 01:43.187
where winning means losing,
and losing means getting

01:43.187 --> 01:47.149
the chance to keep playing
until you finally win...

01:47.149 --> 01:50.319
or lose it all.

01:50.319 --> 01:54.032
Submitted for the approval
of The Midnight Society,

01:54.032 --> 01:57.994
I call this story...

02:16.971 --> 02:19.390
Kara and Ashley
Fox were sisters.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.684
Twin sisters, in fact.

02:21.684 --> 02:24.896
They competed against each
other in everything they did.

02:24.896 --> 02:29.316
From who had better
grades to who had better hair.

02:29.316 --> 02:33.988
But most of all they competed
at Taekowndo.

02:33.988 --> 02:34.888
Break! 2-1 Ashley.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.221
Ready? Fight!

02:54.550 --> 02:58.554
Break! Point Kara!

02:58.554 --> 03:01.766
2 to 2. Next point wins.

03:01.766 --> 03:05.352
Ready, and fight!

03:15.654 --> 03:16.374
Break!

03:24.080 --> 03:26.874
Ashley wins!

03:30.628 --> 03:33.589
You must bow to each other now.

03:36.842 --> 03:39.303
You must bow!
It shows respect.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.434
What a sore loser!

03:45.434 --> 03:48.228
Well, you're a sore winner.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.648
Don't get all mad just
cuz I'm better than you...

03:50.648 --> 03:52.483
which I am...

03:52.483 --> 03:54.860
five times in a row
thank you very much.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.904
SEE!?
I KNEW you'd say that.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.031
Girls, please.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.783
You must not always
concern yourselves

04:00.783 --> 04:02.160
with winning and losing.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.369
It's all part of
the turning wheel,

04:04.369 --> 04:08.958
and the wheel will
come around again.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.751
You are sisters.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.337
You must learn hyup-jo ...

04:13.337 --> 04:14.588
to work together...

04:14.588 --> 04:16.464
to help each other.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.051
I remember my
grandfather told me,

04:19.051 --> 04:24.306
Without hyup-jo ,
there is no victory.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.106
There's no victory
for you, period, Kara.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.273
Not when I'm around.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.984
Ughhh!
You are such a loser!

04:34.984 --> 04:37.028
Me?
You were the one on your butt!

04:37.028 --> 04:39.197
Next time you are going down!

04:39.197 --> 04:41.448
In your dreams.
Excuse me.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.617
You girls were brilliant!

04:43.617 --> 04:45.536
Such fighting spirit!

04:45.536 --> 04:47.705
Such vicious energy!

04:47.705 --> 04:48.956
I loved it.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.415
I didn't see you in there.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.959
Oh but I saw YOU!

04:51.959 --> 04:55.504
Every dazzling move!

04:56.755 --> 04:58.924
My name is Drake. And you are?

04:58.924 --> 05:00.218
Ashley Fox.

05:00.218 --> 05:01.719
Kara Fox.

05:01.719 --> 05:04.471
Sisters too!
Twins I'll wager.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.099
Unfortunately.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.936
Super!

05:10.936 --> 05:13.231
I've got an
opportunity for you two.

05:13.231 --> 05:14.940
What kind of opportunity?

05:14.940 --> 05:17.609
My company is the largest
manufacturer of adventure games

05:17.609 --> 05:19.028
in the world.

05:19.028 --> 05:20.445
No, the UNIVERSE.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.281
Cool.

05:22.281 --> 05:24.867
We're experimenting with a
spanking new game and we're

05:24.867 --> 05:29.747
looking for excellent players
like you to give it a go.

05:29.747 --> 05:31.623
What kind of game?

05:31.623 --> 05:33.834
Oh it's the
ultimate competition!

05:33.834 --> 05:38.714
It takes speed, agility
and spectacular courage.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.507
But I warn you...

05:40.507 --> 05:44.220
It's only for the
best of the best.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.387
I'll cream you.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.472
Huh!
Take your best shot.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.192
Super!

05:49.934 --> 05:54.354
Then prepare yourselves for
the challenge of a lifetime.

05:57.191 --> 06:00.402
You got the address wrong.
This can't be it.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.904
I did not.
Look!

06:01.904 --> 06:03.697
Laser Maze, 153-

06:03.697 --> 06:06.867
Terminal Street.
Glad you made it!

06:06.867 --> 06:08.368
Are you in good fighting spirit?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.454
Are you ready to
take on the world?

06:10.454 --> 06:11.705
Always.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.124
Super!

06:13.124 --> 06:14.324
Follow me!

06:19.379 --> 06:22.216
Where's everybody else?

06:22.216 --> 06:26.262
We're very selective about
who we allow to run the test.

06:26.262 --> 06:30.891
You're the only ones today.

06:30.891 --> 06:36.147
Come on.
It does makes sense.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.609
You've played laser tag before?

06:40.609 --> 06:43.695
Well prepare
yourself for the next step.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.323
You're about to set foot into...

06:45.323 --> 06:49.493
The Laser Maze.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.647
Looks kinda typical to me.

07:18.647 --> 07:23.527
Believe me, there's
nothing typical about THIS game.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.284
The button on your vest releases
the laser from your goggles.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.661
The laser comes
from the goggles.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.454
You aim by looking.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.873
Cool.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.749
Super!

07:37.749 --> 07:40.252
Direct the laser at
your opponents vest.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.838
The first to score
three hits is the winner.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.006
That's it?

07:44.006 --> 07:45.590
That's it!
Are you ready?

07:45.590 --> 07:47.759
I'm ready.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.511
I'm ALWAYS ready.

07:49.511 --> 07:53.640
Then let the games begin!

07:53.640 --> 07:56.894
Don't be distracted by
anything you see or hear.

07:56.894 --> 08:00.814
It's all part of the game.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.775
The Laser Maze is active.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.855
INITIATE!

08:22.627 --> 08:23.347
Super!

08:25.214 --> 08:27.007
Score one for Ashley!

08:27.007 --> 08:31.511
[chanting:]
Ashley! Ashley! Ashley!

08:37.226 --> 08:39.102
Super!

08:39.102 --> 08:41.063
Score one for Kara!

08:41.063 --> 08:44.400
[chanting:]
Kara! Kara!

08:44.400 --> 08:47.069
Hand-eye co-ordination.

08:47.069 --> 08:47.789
Speed.

08:49.447 --> 08:50.407
Agility.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.534
Accuracy.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.959
Sharp work, girls.

09:18.934 --> 09:24.773
Super!
Score two for Ashley!

09:54.803 --> 09:58.974
Two to two.
Next score wins.

10:00.851 --> 10:04.104
Your numbers look super, girls.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.149
I believe you'll do nicely.

10:24.916 --> 10:25.636
Super!

10:27.294 --> 10:29.505
What an amazing victory!

10:29.505 --> 10:32.174
That was so cool! Where's
Ashley?

10:32.174 --> 10:33.467
All part of the game!

10:33.467 --> 10:34.759
She'll be back for Round 2.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.636
Round 2?
Of course!

10:36.636 --> 10:39.056
Now, I want to ask
you some questions...

10:39.056 --> 10:41.559
it's all part of
the testing process.

10:41.559 --> 10:44.562
We'd like you to answer a
few questions about the game.

10:44.562 --> 10:47.105
Things like
accuracy of the goggles,

10:47.105 --> 10:48.607
layout of the maze...

10:48.607 --> 10:51.235
it'll help us make
the best game possible.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.652
Okay, I guess.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.364
Perfect.
I'll be back when you're done.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.366
Where's Ashley?

10:57.366 --> 10:58.867
Filling out the same papers...

10:58.867 --> 11:00.702
wouldn't want you comparing
notes, would we?

11:00.702 --> 11:01.662
Huh?
Huh?

11:33.360 --> 11:34.080
Drake?

11:35.529 --> 11:36.369
Ashley?

11:49.000 --> 11:49.720
Drake?

12:06.435 --> 12:09.104
Kara Alpha Unit.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.106
Ashley Beta Unit.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.483
Processing Now Complete.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.234
Ready for Testing?
What is...?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.153
Finished already?

12:16.153 --> 12:17.488
Yeah.

12:17.488 --> 12:19.573
And I want to leave.
Where's Ashley?

12:19.573 --> 12:21.408
I told you.
She'll be back for-

12:21.408 --> 12:23.868
Forget it I'll
find her myself.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.870
Ashley?

12:30.375 --> 12:33.003
Time for Round 2.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.797
Where have you been?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.303
I said time for Round 2.

12:41.303 --> 12:42.929
I don't want to play anymore.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.764
This place is weird.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.809
But I want to play!
Tough, I'm outta here!

12:47.809 --> 12:53.357
What's the matter?
Afraid you'll lose?

12:53.357 --> 12:56.276
I already won, remember?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.487
That was lucky.
Lucky!?

12:58.487 --> 12:59.821
LUCKY!?

12:59.821 --> 13:02.157
I beat you because I
was better than you,

13:02.157 --> 13:03.575
and I can do it again!

13:03.575 --> 13:06.244
Then prove it.

13:08.788 --> 13:12.167
The Laser Maze is active.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.247
INITIATE!

13:33.522 --> 13:39.027
I am Ashley Betatron number 1.

13:40.404 --> 13:45.534
I am Ashley Betatron
number 1 - number 1.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.703
processed at 093 hours.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.913
Oh not again!

13:49.913 --> 13:51.707
Defective parts.

13:51.707 --> 13:53.667
They're not gonna like this.
Not at all.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.419
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ASHLEY???

13:55.419 --> 13:56.961
Hmmm?
Oh, right.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.672
Maybe I'll have more
luck with the others.

13:58.672 --> 14:02.259
What others?
Let's give it a go, shall we?

14:05.470 --> 14:06.310
Ashley?

14:11.268 --> 14:15.313
Continue the game, please.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.914
Game's over.

15:04.112 --> 15:04.952
Ashley?

15:06.782 --> 15:07.622
Ashley!

15:11.787 --> 15:14.539
Ashley, Is that you?

15:14.539 --> 15:16.875
The REAL you?

15:16.875 --> 15:17.875
Yes.

15:19.043 --> 15:22.088
What's going on?
I can't move.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.800
He's making copies of me.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.239
Well go on!
Go on!

15:53.203 --> 15:55.747
Betatrons, ugh!

15:55.747 --> 15:56.467
Drake!

15:58.625 --> 16:00.293
He-llo!

16:00.293 --> 16:01.837
How are we feeling?

16:01.837 --> 16:03.588
Let us go!

16:03.588 --> 16:05.632
Hmmm... After all that time
I spent looking for you?

16:05.632 --> 16:08.259
I don't think so!
What are you doing to us?

16:08.259 --> 16:11.847
Cloning Betatrons, luv.
What's it look like?

16:15.016 --> 16:18.353
Pick up the pace, would you?

16:20.355 --> 16:23.024
Laser Maze is the most
popular game where I come from.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.610
Unfortunately my people
aren't very good at it.

16:25.610 --> 16:29.447
Not very agile you might say.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.115
So I provide players.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.035
It's all in good fun...
and they pay me a fortune.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.662
But you're hurting Ashley.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.455
Yes, that is a pity.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.666
I can only clone so many
Betatrons before the

16:39.666 --> 16:43.044
Alpha unit goes...
well... wears out.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.629
And I'm next?

16:44.629 --> 16:46.924
You two are the best Alpha
Units I've found so far.

16:46.924 --> 16:49.384
Why I could have...

16:57.475 --> 16:59.018
Drake!

16:59.018 --> 17:01.438
You have failed us.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.523
What?
What do you mean?

17:03.523 --> 17:06.651
You are creating
inferior Betratron units.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.069
Inferior?

17:08.069 --> 17:10.070
Nooo.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.991
No they may need a few
small adjustments but...

17:12.991 --> 17:16.661
We reject your
Ashley betatron units...

17:16.661 --> 17:21.290
and we demand
repayment of our fees.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.917
Repayment?

17:22.917 --> 17:24.335
The money's spent!

17:24.335 --> 17:26.922
How do you think I
pay for this operation?

17:26.922 --> 17:30.634
Step into the transporter Drake.
No!

17:30.634 --> 17:34.012
I mean, there must be
something I can do.

17:34.012 --> 17:37.724
You can return and face us.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.184
No... I won't go! I won't!

17:40.184 --> 17:42.938
Then send us!

17:45.106 --> 17:46.608
What?
-Sure.

17:46.608 --> 17:50.194
Why send clones when you
can have the originals?

17:50.194 --> 17:52.906
You mean you'd go?
And play for them?

17:52.906 --> 17:55.408
It's gotta be better than having
the life sucked out of us here.

17:59.997 --> 18:02.833
What do you think?

18:02.833 --> 18:05.043
The Twins of Terror!

18:05.043 --> 18:09.213
Vicious competitors who
live to humiliate each other!

18:09.213 --> 18:11.716
With their
superior strength, speed,

18:11.716 --> 18:13.384
and high-kicking moves
you've got yourself

18:13.384 --> 18:15.345
a box office sensation.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.806
They'll be lining up across
the galaxy to watch

18:17.806 --> 18:19.265
these girls play laser maze...

18:19.265 --> 18:22.978
and best of all,
they're the originals!

18:26.898 --> 18:30.234
Send them.
Now.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.279
Or return and face us.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.588
Help her out.
Quickly.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.722
How do you feel?

19:00.223 --> 19:02.934
I... I'm starting to wake up.

19:02.934 --> 19:07.397
She'll be fine in a few seconds,
she wasn't in there very long.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.941
Hyup-jo.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.401
Really?

19:11.401 --> 19:14.195
Hey now! No secrets.

19:14.195 --> 19:17.908
Be good little Alpha units
and step into the transporter.

19:17.908 --> 19:18.628
Ta ta!

19:22.787 --> 19:25.373
I've got a better idea.

19:25.373 --> 19:28.043
No.
I sold them on THIS idea.

19:28.043 --> 19:30.294
Let's not make them angry.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.463
Kyongkyuk!

19:36.217 --> 19:37.468
You OK?

19:37.468 --> 19:39.554
Yeah.
You?

19:39.554 --> 19:41.180
Yeah.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.392
I don't want to be here anymore.
Then let's go.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.020
Look out!

19:52.358 --> 19:54.861
I think I like
being on the same team.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.280
The exit's right over...

19:57.280 --> 19:59.950
Hello luvs!

19:59.950 --> 20:02.160
Ready to play me now?

20:02.160 --> 20:05.080
How did he get back?

20:05.080 --> 20:05.800
Super!

20:10.127 --> 20:11.795
Now what?

20:11.795 --> 20:13.088
Hyup-Jo.

20:13.088 --> 20:15.840
We gotta get a pair of goggles.

20:17.801 --> 20:18.551
Go.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.110
Drake!?

20:32.482 --> 20:36.194
Yo Drake?
C'mon, let's play!

20:38.863 --> 20:42.533
No need to shout, I hear you.

20:47.038 --> 20:47.758
Drake.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.877
Come on Drake, you
gotta do better than that!

21:01.011 --> 21:04.097
Kara. If he gets us three
times, we're back in the tank.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.473
Unless we get him first.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.809
Does this work on him?
It better.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.727
Bikyu jitgi!

21:42.301 --> 21:45.055
Duihooryu chagi!

21:54.689 --> 21:57.316
We got him twice.
Once more and he's toast.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.972
What happened?

22:27.972 --> 22:32.643
I am Drake Betatron number 88.

22:32.643 --> 22:33.895
He's a Betatron!

22:33.895 --> 22:35.605
A busted Betatron.

22:35.605 --> 22:39.692
I was processed at 680 hours.

22:39.692 --> 22:43.113
The wheel has come full circle.

22:43.113 --> 22:47.284
Yeah.
And it just rolled over him.

22:47.284 --> 22:50.954
I'm sorry I didn't
show you respect.

22:50.954 --> 22:53.581
I'm the one who should be sorry.

22:53.581 --> 22:56.042
Thank you for saving me.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.012
The end.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.430
Cool!

23:09.430 --> 23:11.099
That was good.

23:11.099 --> 23:14.435
I'm gonna take tae kwon do.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.146
Hyup!

23:16.146 --> 23:17.355
I want a re-match!

23:17.355 --> 23:20.358
Anyday!
-Right now!

23:21.651 --> 23:26.072
Uh, guys, we gotta go.

23:42.213 --> 23:45.591
This is gonna be
a long walk back.
