00:53.885 --> 00:55.405
{\an8}Is Spellbound
really that popular?

00:55.925 --> 00:58.445
{\an8}I mean, it's not Cackle's Chanting Contest
or anything.

00:58.525 --> 01:01.125
{\an8}It's only the biggest witching concert
of the year.

01:01.765 --> 01:03.485
My parents are the headline act,

01:03.565 --> 01:05.885
{\an8}and I'm finally old enough
to perform on stage.

01:05.965 --> 01:08.285
{\an8}Think they're going to ask me to join
The Nightshades.

01:08.365 --> 01:10.445
I've heard Spellbound
is not what it used to be.

01:10.524 --> 01:11.765
They let anyone in now.

01:11.845 --> 01:13.245
Are you kidding?

01:13.325 --> 01:14.485
Mirage will be there.

01:15.085 --> 01:17.285
She's so cool she only has one name.

01:21.085 --> 01:22.085
Maud!

01:23.485 --> 01:24.565
Maud? Are you okay?

01:24.645 --> 01:26.085
Midnight's lost his tail.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.045
What?

01:33.765 --> 01:36.885
Not only
is your essay late, Beatrice Bunch,

01:36.965 --> 01:39.485
it is incomprehensible.

01:40.845 --> 01:43.125
Your grades have been
in decline for weeks.

01:43.205 --> 01:47.405
You have been spending far too much time
helping Miss Tapioca.

01:47.485 --> 01:48.845
I'm really sorry, Miss Hardbroom.

01:48.925 --> 01:51.685
It's just that... I enjoy cooking and--

01:51.765 --> 01:52.925
Enough.

01:53.005 --> 01:57.245
We teach witches to brew potions
at this academy, not soups.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.205
Pass tomorrow's potion safety assessment

02:02.285 --> 02:04.045
or I shall have to tutor you myself.

02:04.845 --> 02:06.605
For the rest of the term.

02:19.325 --> 02:20.925
Yep. I can feel it.

02:21.605 --> 02:25.005
I know what's happening.
Midnight's losing his magic.

02:25.085 --> 02:27.725
My grandad used to tell me
that when a familiar loses its magic,

02:27.805 --> 02:29.285
it begins to disappear.

02:30.365 --> 02:32.045
So you'll have an invisible cat?

02:32.605 --> 02:33.645
That could be fun.

02:34.165 --> 02:36.205
Eventually I'll lose him altogether.

02:36.285 --> 02:39.645
There must be a cure.
We just have to ask the right person.

02:40.605 --> 02:42.085
You lot better get to class.

02:42.165 --> 02:44.005
I'll look after Midnight.

02:44.725 --> 02:46.645
I think I know a way
we can keep him visible.

02:47.365 --> 02:49.325
Trust me. I might not be magic anymore,

02:49.405 --> 02:51.565
but I've still got a few tricks
up my sleeve.

02:52.325 --> 02:53.365
Leave him with me.

02:56.965 --> 03:00.685
Last chance to sign up
for the Chanting Contest.

03:00.765 --> 03:04.285
You need to see Miss Bat
in the Great Hall.

03:04.365 --> 03:05.685
Um, Mr Rowan-Webb?

03:06.205 --> 03:08.685
Do you know anything
about familiars losing their magic?

03:08.765 --> 03:09.885
And turning invisible.

03:09.965 --> 03:11.725
We wanted to know if there was a cure.

03:11.805 --> 03:12.765
Hmm.

03:14.005 --> 03:16.845
Hmm, disappearing cats.

03:18.085 --> 03:22.965
Yes. There is a spell
to make them visible again.

03:23.045 --> 03:26.725
What causes it, though?
Why does the familiar lose all its magic?

03:27.205 --> 03:31.285
Well, there's a theory
that if a familiar loses its magic,

03:31.365 --> 03:34.365
it's a sign its owner's powers
are corrupted.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.565
Every spell they cast

03:37.645 --> 03:39.485
will be doomed to fail.

03:41.525 --> 03:42.765
Forever.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.885
<i>Is this magic or am I crazy?</i>

03:47.965 --> 03:49.605
<i>I think I smell...</i>

03:49.685 --> 03:51.405
I'd love to be able to chant like her.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.525
You do realize you don't have
enough time to sign up, right?

03:54.605 --> 03:55.805
You're supposed to be revising.

03:55.885 --> 03:59.805
<i>Wrapping between us a friendship chain</i>

04:00.285 --> 04:03.885
<i>Feel it now, let it grow</i>

04:03.965 --> 04:07.605
<i>A bond between us that will never go</i>

04:07.685 --> 04:11.405
<i>Should you need me, pull this thread</i>

04:11.485 --> 04:15.565
<i>And I will follow wherever you tread</i>

04:18.565 --> 04:21.805
I hope you girls will be hungry tomorrow.
I've got a full spread.

04:21.885 --> 04:24.565
Pumpkin rings, spam surprise, kidney pie.

04:24.645 --> 04:27.445
I'll get back to revising this evening,
don't worry.

04:29.325 --> 04:31.965
Let's hope Mildred got the goosegrass
and baneberry.

04:32.045 --> 04:33.605
The rest we can get in the potions lab.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.445
He's only disappearing
because of my corrupted magic.

04:37.565 --> 04:39.165
How do you know it's corrupted?

04:39.245 --> 04:41.445
Mr Rowan-Webb said it's only a theory.

04:41.525 --> 04:43.565
All of my spells
have been going wrong lately.

04:44.445 --> 04:45.885
This was supposed to be for Star.

04:46.445 --> 04:48.085
It came out with eight legs!

04:49.525 --> 04:51.445
It was my dream to study at Cackle's.

04:51.965 --> 04:53.885
Do you think they'll let me stay
when everyone finds out?

04:56.365 --> 04:57.405
Who's that?

04:58.045 --> 05:01.525
It's my parents.
They've sent a parcel to my bedroom.

05:03.525 --> 05:05.805
You go. I'll meet you in potions.

05:05.885 --> 05:07.445
I'm so sorry.

05:09.765 --> 05:11.085
Thank you.

05:42.405 --> 05:45.405
Oh, sorry, is Maud around?
I just wanted to show her something.

05:46.085 --> 05:48.605
She's gone to meet Mildred
in the potions lab.

05:50.445 --> 05:51.645
Is everything alright?

05:54.525 --> 05:55.685
Apology from Mum and Dad.

05:56.685 --> 05:59.165
They said they were going to take me
to Spellbound tomorrow.

05:59.245 --> 06:00.525
But now they're too busy.

06:00.605 --> 06:02.605
Oh, love, I'm sorry.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.805
Thought they were going to invite me
on stage to perform with them.

06:07.605 --> 06:09.445
But now they're teaming up with Mirage.

06:10.525 --> 06:11.845
Makes sense, I guess.

06:12.765 --> 06:15.125
Why would they want to perform
with their average daughter,

06:15.205 --> 06:19.605
when they could team up with someone
special and talented like that?

06:23.405 --> 06:25.165
Listen...

06:26.805 --> 06:28.965
Parents do get it wrong sometimes.

06:29.965 --> 06:31.725
It doesn't mean we don't love our kids.

06:33.365 --> 06:35.845
I bet your mum and dad are really proud

06:35.925 --> 06:40.125
to have a daughter as kind and funny
and courageous as you.

06:41.245 --> 06:45.605
Please don't tell anyone that they
cancelled. I could never live it down.

06:45.685 --> 06:46.685
Mum's the word.

06:47.405 --> 06:48.965
Come on, let's go and find Maud.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.525
And I thought he could wear this.

07:18.245 --> 07:19.885
So you can really keep an eye on him.

07:19.965 --> 07:22.845
I love it! But, how did you
knit everything so quickly?

07:22.925 --> 07:26.045
Well, you don't have to be magic
to be a wizard with some knitting needles.

07:27.205 --> 07:28.565
Um, Maud.

07:30.965 --> 07:31.885
Oh.

07:31.965 --> 07:34.125
Maybe I should have made him
some mittens as well?

07:35.645 --> 07:38.125
Right, I better get
to this staff spell seminar.

07:38.205 --> 07:40.365
HB should be there for a while,

07:40.445 --> 07:42.605
but I'll give you a warning
if she's heading your way.

07:42.685 --> 07:43.565
Thanks, Mum.

07:48.525 --> 07:50.045
How's the cure coming along?

07:50.125 --> 07:51.965
There's one ingredient I couldn't find.

07:54.165 --> 07:58.125
"Tears of an Albion oracle.
Better known as the wise owl."

07:58.205 --> 08:00.885
It's this all-knowing bird
that has the answers to everything.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.325
Its tears have healing powers.

08:03.405 --> 08:06.365
But nobody's seen any around in years.
It's thought to be extinct.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.885
You could try summoning one.

08:07.965 --> 08:11.285
Not with my corrupted magic.
You could try though.

08:13.725 --> 08:14.565
Me?

08:14.645 --> 08:17.085
Enid, please. I really need you right now.

08:21.285 --> 08:22.605
I won't let Maud down.

08:22.685 --> 08:26.525
If there's even one wise owl still
out there, then I'm going to find it.

08:27.165 --> 08:30.125
Well, I'll be lantern-lighting
if you need me. Good luck.

08:35.525 --> 08:37.924
<i> Rise and fall, swoop and fly.</i>

08:38.005 --> 08:40.125
<i>Soar across the moonlit sky.</i>

08:40.205 --> 08:42.485
Come to me, magic fowl,

08:42.563 --> 08:45.845
I summon you, great wise owl!

09:02.325 --> 09:03.605
Owls aren't fowls.

09:04.725 --> 09:05.645
Okay.

09:06.285 --> 09:10.805
<i>Rise and fall, swoop and fly...</i>

09:10.885 --> 09:14.085
...swoop and fly,
soar across the moonlit sky.

09:14.165 --> 09:16.645
Great wise owl, hear my plea,

09:16.725 --> 09:18.885
prove you're there and come to me.

09:49.245 --> 09:50.165
Yes!

09:51.605 --> 09:52.525
Hello.

09:53.805 --> 09:55.205
Oh, you're beautiful.

09:58.805 --> 10:00.485
Bet you've flown a long way to get here.

10:02.125 --> 10:03.285
My name is Enid.

10:04.285 --> 10:07.325
I called you here because
my friend's cat is turning invisible,

10:08.605 --> 10:10.525
and I need your tears to cure him.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.085
Would you mind?

10:16.885 --> 10:20.525
Maybe you need some... inspiration.

10:22.005 --> 10:24.325
This story's a bit of a weeper.

10:25.765 --> 10:29.725
It's all about the star-crossed sorcerers,
Roman and Julia.

10:29.805 --> 10:31.165
"Once upon a time...

10:31.245 --> 10:33.005
...and that day he met...

10:33.085 --> 10:34.845
...the family said they could never
be together...

10:34.925 --> 10:36.645
...he fell, she wept with sorrow...

10:36.725 --> 10:37.885
...the end."

11:05.325 --> 11:06.405
Seriously?

11:08.205 --> 11:09.165
Nothing?

11:11.845 --> 11:13.325
I've left Midnight with your Mum.

11:13.405 --> 11:15.565
I can't take him to class
and I don't want him to be on his own.

11:15.645 --> 11:16.485
Maud!

11:16.565 --> 11:17.765
I've found a wise owl!

11:17.845 --> 11:19.525
What? The spell worked?

11:19.605 --> 11:20.925
Took a few attempts, but yeah.

11:21.005 --> 11:22.765
Enid, you're amazing! Thank you!

11:23.405 --> 11:24.965
You don't believe her, do you?

11:25.045 --> 11:27.165
Wise owls are all extinct.

11:27.245 --> 11:30.725
All but one. It's in my room right now.

11:30.805 --> 11:33.325
Who knows,
maybe I'll get an award for finding it.

11:33.405 --> 11:35.285
I'd love to see a wise owl.

11:35.365 --> 11:37.885
But sadly, they don't exist.

11:39.445 --> 11:40.885
Unless you can prove me wrong.

11:50.605 --> 11:51.765
Let me guess.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.165
It flew away?

11:54.205 --> 11:55.285
No.

11:55.365 --> 11:59.285
It... It was right here, I swear.

11:59.365 --> 12:00.645
I knew you were lying.

12:00.725 --> 12:03.085
It's not enough that you're performing
at Spellbound,

12:03.165 --> 12:05.285
you want to take the credit
for a wise owl as well?

12:09.965 --> 12:12.445
"Hope you don't mind
missing the concert..."

12:12.525 --> 12:13.765
Hey! That's private.

12:14.645 --> 12:16.445
So, you're a liar on both counts.

12:17.085 --> 12:18.885
I should have known.

12:21.885 --> 12:23.525
Did you just say it for attention?

12:23.605 --> 12:24.525
No.

12:27.365 --> 12:28.325
Maud!

12:30.205 --> 12:31.325
Maybe you dreamt it?

12:38.205 --> 12:42.485
Ooh, there it is again the little pest.

12:43.005 --> 12:44.685
Go on, shoo!

12:45.645 --> 12:47.365
I've never seen an owl like that before.

12:47.445 --> 12:48.845
It's gorgeous.

12:53.125 --> 12:54.445
How did it get in here?

12:55.765 --> 12:57.645
Don't you two
have exams to go to?

12:58.645 --> 13:00.645
Go on! Go.

13:00.725 --> 13:01.725
Both of you.

13:02.845 --> 13:04.685
-And good luck.
-Thanks.

13:05.205 --> 13:06.125
Won't need it!

13:08.685 --> 13:09.685
I will.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.965
You may now begin
your examination.

14:00.045 --> 14:02.165
Beatrice Bunch. A word.

14:04.685 --> 14:08.405
I have just marked your assessment.
Would you like to know your score?

14:13.005 --> 14:16.525
You passed with one hundred per cent.

14:17.885 --> 14:19.445
Surprising, is it not?

14:20.205 --> 14:23.565
Not for me, Miss Hardbroom.
I've never studied so hard in my life.

14:25.325 --> 14:28.685
Well, I do hope your luck continues,
Miss Bunch.

14:32.685 --> 14:35.685
You must have
really buckled down last night.

14:36.205 --> 14:38.765
Yeah... I mean, it was all a blur.

14:40.645 --> 14:42.885
That's a weird thing to lie about. An owl?

14:42.965 --> 14:46.485
Not really. Wise owls are very powerful.

14:46.565 --> 14:50.725
Just one of their golden feathers knows
the answer to every question ever asked.

14:51.845 --> 14:55.125
If she had found one, she'd be
the most celebrated witch at Cackle's.

14:55.485 --> 14:57.205
Maybe I should summon one.

15:04.805 --> 15:06.965
I want to write an original chant.

15:07.045 --> 15:09.525
One which will make the wise owl
appear on stage.

15:10.005 --> 15:11.965
I think that will
really impress the judges.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.645
Rise and fall, swoop and fly,

15:21.725 --> 15:24.805
soar across the sunlit sky.

15:24.885 --> 15:27.805
Great wise owl, hear my plea,

15:27.885 --> 15:30.205
prove you're there and come to me.

15:45.485 --> 15:46.525
Gotcha.

15:47.845 --> 15:50.205
Within this school you shall remain,

15:50.285 --> 15:52.845
enchanted owl, I now contain.

15:56.605 --> 15:57.845
I'm sorry.

15:57.925 --> 16:01.245
But I can't let you leave the academy
until I have your tears.

16:01.325 --> 16:02.445
It's too important.

16:03.605 --> 16:04.445
Close the door!

16:05.405 --> 16:06.365
No!

16:08.845 --> 16:09.845
Sorry.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.005
Since when were you so interested
in chanting?

16:15.085 --> 16:17.245
Since I was guaranteed to win.

16:18.285 --> 16:20.605
Miss Bat, is it too late to enter?

16:20.685 --> 16:22.685
We're due to start rehearsing.

16:22.765 --> 16:25.205
I'm sure we can make allowances, Miss
Bat.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.205
And since we're still waiting
on a number of pupils...

16:31.725 --> 16:34.125
perhaps you would like to audition for us,
Beatrice?

16:38.165 --> 16:41.325
<i>More than a bird</i>
<i>Although it flies</i>

16:41.405 --> 16:44.205
<i>This great owl is incredibly wise</i>

16:44.285 --> 16:47.405
<i>Let it appear</i>
<i>Let it draw near</i>

16:47.485 --> 16:51.205
<i>You and your friends</i>
<i>Have nothing to fear</i>

16:55.125 --> 16:56.925
Oh, wow!

16:59.765 --> 17:02.205
It was supposed to be a wise owl.

17:03.645 --> 17:04.845
There's another one!

17:09.484 --> 17:10.885
Oh, another one.

17:18.484 --> 17:19.484
Oh, dear.

17:20.724 --> 17:22.165
Bea, what have you done?

17:23.525 --> 17:24.885
The owls won't stop multiplying.

17:24.964 --> 17:27.005
I don't know. I didn't think
the chant could go wrong.

17:29.124 --> 17:31.525
We'll have to use
a very precise locating spell,

17:31.604 --> 17:34.285
otherwise we could end up
with the wrong owl.

17:34.365 --> 17:36.765
Still pretending you summoned a wise owl,
are you?

17:36.845 --> 17:38.685
Sure it wasn't just one of these?

17:42.525 --> 17:43.365
Beatrice.

17:43.445 --> 17:45.525
Much as I'm fond of bird spotting,

17:45.605 --> 17:47.645
I'd rather not do it inside the castle.

17:48.605 --> 17:51.005
I think you should put this right now,
don't you?

17:54.965 --> 17:58.125
I'm sorry, Midnight.
You deserved a better owner than me.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.245
Maud.

18:01.525 --> 18:03.965
I promise I was telling the truth earlier.

18:04.045 --> 18:08.285
There is a wise owl. It's back
and it's in the castle somewhere.

18:09.965 --> 18:14.205
I'm telling the truth. I cast a
containment spell so it can't get out.

18:15.045 --> 18:16.405
It could be anywhere.

18:16.485 --> 18:18.565
So we cast a locating spell.

18:18.925 --> 18:20.565
I need your help.

18:20.645 --> 18:21.645
Please?

18:21.725 --> 18:24.005
You know I can't do any spells right...

18:24.645 --> 18:25.645
at the moment.

18:25.725 --> 18:28.565
You've been a bit magic-blocked,
that's all.

18:30.565 --> 18:34.005
If we can get the tears,
we can save Midnight.

18:48.805 --> 18:49.805
Thanks for the help.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.165
No way.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.685
You're the wise owl?

19:05.845 --> 19:08.165
Where are you, oh, Golden Owl?

19:08.245 --> 19:10.405
In the darkness, on the prowl,

19:10.485 --> 19:12.765
seek him out and find his lair,

19:12.845 --> 19:14.725
find him now and take us there.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.405
We did it.

19:21.365 --> 19:23.005
It really is a wise owl.

19:23.845 --> 19:24.885
And it's mine.

19:25.605 --> 19:27.485
Ethel! What are you doing?

19:27.565 --> 19:29.765
I'm going to reveal it during my chant.

19:30.205 --> 19:33.005
You're seriously going to take the credit
for Enid's spell?

19:33.085 --> 19:35.885
Ethel, you can't keep the wise owl
caged up.

19:35.965 --> 19:37.685
-It's not right.
-That's funny.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.485
Who put that forcefield there, then?

19:41.245 --> 19:44.485
Even if I did set him free,
he'd still be a prisoner.

19:45.365 --> 19:46.845
And whose fault is that?

19:48.445 --> 19:49.445
Midnight, now!

20:07.045 --> 20:08.085
You can keep him.

20:09.085 --> 20:10.725
Any owl that takes your side...

20:11.805 --> 20:13.005
can't be that wise.

20:19.365 --> 20:20.365
Are you okay?

20:20.925 --> 20:23.005
I'm sorry I cast the containment spell.

20:23.485 --> 20:25.285
Please don't think
I'm anything like Ethel.

20:25.965 --> 20:28.565
He's never going to give us his tears
while we're keeping him prisoner.

20:29.365 --> 20:32.125
But maybe if we let him go,
he'll return the kindness.

20:32.645 --> 20:34.725
We might lose our only chance.

20:34.805 --> 20:35.645
I know.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.485
But I won't punish one animal
to save another.

20:39.565 --> 20:40.725
Let him go.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.205
Let him go,

20:49.285 --> 20:51.485
set him free,

20:51.565 --> 20:52.765
this owl should fly, a joy to see.

20:58.845 --> 21:01.405
Please. We need your tears.

21:06.085 --> 21:06.925
No!

21:12.485 --> 21:14.925
I don't even know why these owls
keep appearing.

21:15.005 --> 21:16.765
My chant should have never gone wrong.

21:17.245 --> 21:18.245
How do you mean?

21:23.365 --> 21:25.485
I used this. It's from a wise owl.

21:26.565 --> 21:28.325
It's how I passed the assessment.

21:29.165 --> 21:32.005
So, you cheated?
You never did any revision?

21:32.485 --> 21:34.285
I thought something strange was going on.

21:34.365 --> 21:37.045
I'm sorry, okay?
I just got a bit carried away.

21:37.125 --> 21:41.045
After I passed my assessment, I thought
I could easily win the chanting contest.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.045
The feather's supposed to know everything.

21:43.125 --> 21:44.805
So how could it have gone wrong?

21:44.885 --> 21:45.725
Look.

21:46.725 --> 21:48.405
It's losing its shine.

21:48.485 --> 21:50.605
It's been away from the wise owl
for too long.

21:51.325 --> 21:54.805
You've used nearly all of its magic.
That's why it's been back-firing.

21:54.885 --> 21:57.085
But I can't undo this without it.

21:57.165 --> 21:58.285
Yes, you can.

21:58.365 --> 22:00.845
You came down to the kitchens
when you needed to think,

22:00.925 --> 22:03.845
because cooking
comes naturally to you, right?

22:03.925 --> 22:06.765
Well, potion making
is no different to cooking.

22:06.845 --> 22:09.485
Just imagine this bowl is a cauldron.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.765
What would be
the perfect owl-vanishing recipe?

22:16.085 --> 22:17.565
I'm so sorry, Maud.

22:18.165 --> 22:20.045
You needed me, and I let you down.

22:20.645 --> 22:21.845
You didn't.

22:21.925 --> 22:25.725
It means a lot that you tried to save
Midnight. I never should have doubted you.

22:27.605 --> 22:29.605
-Friends?
-Course we're friends.

22:37.085 --> 22:37.925
Look!

22:43.765 --> 22:44.765
Quick.

23:04.085 --> 23:05.165
We got the tears!

23:09.885 --> 23:12.205
Thank you! Thank you!

23:20.885 --> 23:22.685
In go the tears.

23:22.765 --> 23:23.725
And done.

23:24.765 --> 23:26.005
Now all we need is...

23:31.005 --> 23:32.485
Midnight. Where is he?

23:33.925 --> 23:35.365
We're not too late are we?

23:40.045 --> 23:41.725
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

23:44.885 --> 23:46.965
Mildred's got a surprise for you,
down in the garden.

23:47.045 --> 23:48.245
-What is it?
-Dunno.

23:48.325 --> 23:50.045
But she said to tell you to hurry.

23:52.405 --> 23:53.365
Come on.

24:02.245 --> 24:04.445
So, I couldn't find The Wise Owl
but I found Midnight.

24:07.245 --> 24:08.765
But, he's...

24:08.845 --> 24:10.005
A mother.

24:10.085 --> 24:11.885
Midnight's a girl.

24:11.965 --> 24:14.205
Sometimes when mother cats have kittens,

24:14.285 --> 24:16.765
they accidentally transfer their magic
to their young.

24:16.845 --> 24:18.245
Oh.

24:18.325 --> 24:20.045
So, it's not because my magic's corrupted?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.485
Of course not! Who on earth told you that?

24:24.005 --> 24:25.925
A word of advice, girls.

24:26.005 --> 24:30.085
Wizards don't usually have familiars,
and they don't know anything about them.

24:30.165 --> 24:31.005
Uh--

24:31.085 --> 24:34.165
Never listen to one
when it comes to the subject of cats.

24:35.685 --> 24:37.125
We found the wise owl.

24:37.725 --> 24:38.925
And we've got the cure.

24:44.045 --> 24:47.845
Now you need not disappear,
I will always keep you near.

24:47.925 --> 24:51.845
Magic tears means magic found,
my potion keeps you safe and sound.

24:54.685 --> 24:56.605
Aw.

24:58.845 --> 24:59.845
You saved her.

25:04.565 --> 25:08.685
<i> And I will follow,</i>
<i>wherever you tread</i>

25:12.285 --> 25:14.485
All right, thanks,
settle down everybody.

25:15.405 --> 25:17.205
Please welcome to the stage,

25:17.285 --> 25:18.925
Beatrice Bunch.

26:07.165 --> 26:08.285
<i> Owls are fine</i>

26:08.365 --> 26:09.925
<i>and owls are fair</i>

26:10.005 --> 26:12.685
<i>But only if you want them there</i>

26:13.165 --> 26:15.845
<i>Now then, shall I boil or bake</i>

26:15.925 --> 26:18.925
<i>I could make a wondrous cake</i>

26:19.005 --> 26:21.685
<i>Stir it round with all my might</i>

26:21.765 --> 26:24.285
<i>Twice to the left and once to the right</i>

26:24.805 --> 26:27.485
<i>Heat the brew with ice and flame</i>

26:28.365 --> 26:31.725
<i>Back you go from whence you came</i>

26:47.525 --> 26:50.445
Oh, very clever, Beatrice. Well done!

26:56.805 --> 26:58.365
It's a souvenir to say thank you.

27:01.205 --> 27:02.965
Is that the Albion oracle?

27:04.125 --> 27:06.485
Yes, Miss Hardbroom. I summoned it.

27:06.565 --> 27:07.805
Impossible.

27:07.885 --> 27:11.285
The oracle would not answer the call
of so young a witch.

27:11.365 --> 27:13.365
It would take
a very special feat of witchery

27:13.445 --> 27:16.245
far beyond your years
to summon such a creature.

27:18.045 --> 27:19.405
Thank you, Miss Hardbroom.

27:19.485 --> 27:21.125
I had no idea I was so special.

27:22.205 --> 27:23.205
We did.
