Tim, you were a real

00:07.208 --> 00:09.141
and I'll try not to be one
in the future.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.442
Thank you.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.678
Do any of you have
good Christmas memories?

00:12.680 --> 00:16.715
Uh, try foster home Christmas.
They'd send me back to the state

00:16.717 --> 00:19.184
a week earlier so they wouldn't
have to get me a present.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.753
Well, I am running
for the 16th district alderman

00:20.755 --> 00:22.221
of west altadenia

00:22.223 --> 00:23.555
in the local
upcoming election.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.524
I hope I can count on your vote.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.193
That was my old commander.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.728
He needs a new
head of security.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.230
In amman.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.265
Jordan?
That's... way out of town.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.467
I think it's about time
i have a talk with cabe

00:35.469 --> 00:37.202
about making my position
here permanent.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.737
That's great news.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.607
Conning Paige may have been an
efficient way to impress her,

00:41.609 --> 00:43.475
but it's not the honest way.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.777
Well, for the record,

00:44.779 --> 00:47.613
this makes me want you
to end up with her even more.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.615
You're a really
good man, Walter,

00:49.617 --> 00:52.751

Christmas Eve traffic

01:07.635 --> 01:09.602

Handling geniuses is literally
my job description.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.861
Walter: Someone mention Tetris?
You know,

01:35.863 --> 01:37.429
the geometrical
construct of that game

01:37.431 --> 01:39.798
has applications
in computational
complexity theory.

Interesting. Why don't you
take your bag and...

01:42.103 --> 01:43.435

01:50.377 --> 01:51.743
Sparkling Mike.

01:51.745 --> 01:56.148
A real robot with 178 tiny gears

01:57.518 --> 01:59.618
for Christmas

01:59.620 --> 02:01.220
You know what she got
from the group home?

02:01.222 --> 02:02.822
A promotional bank calendar.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.423
That when her Christmas
issues started?
Yep.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.425
And they all end today.

02:06.427 --> 02:09.161
I spent a lot of time and money
finding this thing

02:09.163 --> 02:10.529

restored, Paige.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.331

tomorrow morning to open it.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.946
how do you know that
down to the brand name?

03:00.948 --> 03:04.249
Because grandma
can't wrap presents.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.250
Oh.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.819

03:40.821 --> 03:43.655
Oh, I won't just try,
i will enjoy it.
Good.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.390

23:49.529 --> 23:50.928

Yeah, well, so was I.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.965
I never liked you

23:54.967 --> 23:57.935

getting ready,

All armed to the teeth.

25:39.906 --> 25:43.007
Guess we're not the only ones
who called for reinforcements.

Around the front.

25:55.655 --> 25:56.921
Bad guys coming!
Battle stations!

Atf?

No, he's one
of us. At least,

28:25.104 --> 28:26.704

stole our money.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.006
Tim, you stay here

28:29.008 --> 28:30.374
Happy, you give him a hand.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.408
Doc, you're with me.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.443
This ends
in a hostage situation,

28:32.445 --> 28:34.445
I might need your skills.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.183
Any of you feel froggy,

28:39.185 --> 28:40.918
before you jump,
think about this:

28:40.920 --> 28:42.953
I'm a pissed-off ex-Navy seal,

28:42.955 --> 28:44.288
and even I'm scared of her.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.958
Paige:
<i> How did this happen?</i>

28:47.960 --> 28:49.376
Sam is a gunrunner.
He stole money from the rest

28:49.377 --> 28:50.793
of the crew and they were
gonna kill him for it.

28:50.796 --> 28:53.330
No, I get that part.
I mean how did we get tricked?

28:53.332 --> 28:54.865
When Sam realized
that Walter and Tim

28:54.867 --> 28:56.366
were with homeland
he made up a story

28:56.368 --> 28:58.602
to keep from getting arrested.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.837
And then he knew someone I know
at the atf, so I believed him.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.340
Of course. If he's been busted
for running guns,

29:03.342 --> 29:04.908
he would know people at the atf.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.444
How did Toby miss this?
He's a human lie detector.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.847
You guys told me
Sam was atf,

29:09.849 --> 29:11.115
not Sam himself.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.783
You believed him,
so you weren't lying.

29:12.785 --> 29:13.817
There was nothing
for me to read.

29:13.819 --> 29:14.885
And Sam's deception markers

29:14.887 --> 29:16.120
could have easily
been masked

29:16.122 --> 29:17.488
by the intense pain
of his injury.

29:17.490 --> 29:18.889
Injury is nothing
compared to

29:18.891 --> 29:20.257
what I'll do to him
when we catch him.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.060
(Tires screeching)

29:29.068 --> 29:30.868
Sam:
Sit down, kid.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.205
(Groans)

29:44.150 --> 29:45.849
Toby:
<i> We can't let Sam get away.</i>

29:45.851 --> 29:47.017
Hostages don't fare well

29:47.019 --> 29:48.452
once they've outlived
their usefulness.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.954
I know the stats, doc.
We need an idea.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.036
Holy stowaways!
There's Ralph!

30:06.038 --> 30:07.504
Oh, my god, Ralph!

30:15.848 --> 30:17.447
He jimmied the trunk
with my knife.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.349
Smart boy. He knows
there's only one way

30:19.351 --> 30:21.151
we can stop that car,

30:21.152 --> 30:22.952
and if he's in a small,
enclosed space,

30:22.955 --> 30:24.388
he significantly reduces
his chances of injury.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.856
Cabe,

30:25.857 --> 30:27.323
drive Sam off the side road
coming up.

31:00.593 --> 31:01.625
I'm already frightened.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.627
Sam is gonna barrel
toward a log

31:03.629 --> 31:04.895
he was sitting on earlier.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.163
Sam won't remember
where it was.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.131
He has 110 IQ, tops.
What?

31:08.133 --> 31:10.367
No. Ralph is
in the trunk.
Exactly.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.269
If he hits it,
the front of the car will

31:12.271 --> 31:13.337
take the bulk of the force--
he'll be okay.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.407
When?
Right around this turn.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.210
Ralph, close the trunk.

31:21.447 --> 31:22.613
Hold on.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.323

31:33.325 --> 31:35.392

35:12.444 --> 35:13.743

But where I'm going...
Is no place for Ralph.

35:33.599 --> 35:36.833
And I might not be
a genius, but...

35:36.835 --> 35:38.635
I know that I'm crazy
about that kid,

35:38.637 --> 35:42.572

for him to be is here,

35:42.574 --> 35:44.508

35:44.510 --> 35:45.909

36:00.192 --> 36:01.424

36:01.426 --> 36:03.160
we can do Christmas
morning with Ralph.

Mm-hmm.

Oh.

Well, how 'bout this?

36:12.838 --> 36:15.438
