WEBVTT

00:22.939 --> 00:25.316
<i> What is it that haunts you?</i>

00:27.193 --> 00:30.947
<i>Whose eyes peer at you from the dark?</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:42.542
Jin. Jin Kazama.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.461
Earth to Jin.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.589
-Hello?
-Xiaoyu.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.591
What are you doing here?

00:50.550 --> 00:52.343
Give me a break, Kazama.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.930
You think you're the only one
from Mishima Polytech to enter the King--

00:56.014 --> 00:59.476
Or should we soon say
Queen of Iron Fist Tournament?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.729
Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

01:03.646 --> 01:04.481
I meant--

01:06.941 --> 01:11.488
Ah, it's okay, Mr. Serious.
I got in late last night.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.739
Oh, wait. Jin.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.616
You know your fight is next.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.326
What are you doing up here?

01:16.409 --> 01:20.955
I was… clearing my head before the fight.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.501
Good idea.
You should be as prepared as possible.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.004
I saw your opponent warming up.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.510
He's a kung-fu guy. Fast.

01:40.558 --> 01:43.019
Leroy Smith?

01:44.646 --> 01:47.482
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:47.565 --> 01:52.362
<i>thank you for joining us</i>
<i>at the King of Iron Fist Tournament.</i>

01:53.113 --> 01:59.285
<i>Next match, Jin Kazama versus Leroy Smith.</i>

02:15.969 --> 02:18.847
I've got a bone to pick
with your boy, Heihachi.

02:18.930 --> 02:19.889
Kazama.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.808
Yes.

02:21.891 --> 02:22.892
Smith.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.820
Hmm.

02:37.615 --> 02:38.491
<i> Begin!</i>

03:55.068 --> 03:56.110
Hmm.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.925
Damn. Leroy's good.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.197
Hmm.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.590
Not gonna stop.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.427
Heihachi has to pay.

05:19.527 --> 05:23.531
Not gonna get shown up by a thug.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.877
Stay down.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.422
-You've lost this one.

05:40.006 --> 05:40.923
No!

05:49.557 --> 05:50.683
Hmm.

05:53.144 --> 05:56.147
You've lost this fight!

06:25.134 --> 06:28.388
<i>The winner, Jin Kazama!</i>

07:01.754 --> 07:06.676
Uh… why the gloomy face, Kazama?

07:07.760 --> 07:11.180
-You look like someone who lost a fight.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.307
Uh, easy there, tiger.

07:13.391 --> 07:17.311
The guy wouldn't back down.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.815
There had to be a better way
for you to end it, Kazama.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.110
You mangled the guy's leg.

07:25.903 --> 07:29.657
Hurt them where they hurt you.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.493
You've learned a lot from Heihachi.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.705
The Mishima brand of sportsmanship.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.833
I didn't wanna hurt the guy,

07:38.916 --> 07:41.794
but it was personal for him
for some reason,

07:41.878 --> 07:44.338
and he wasn't going to stop.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.593
We all have our own reasons
for being here, Kazama.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.220
<i>Something deep down</i>

07:52.180 --> 07:54.640
<i>drives every single one of us,</i>

07:55.683 --> 07:57.226
not just you.

08:01.772 --> 08:06.027
<i>Next up,</i>
<i>Ling Xiaoyu versus Nina Williams.</i>

08:06.110 --> 08:08.321
<i>Fighters, report to Ring Two.</i>

08:08.404 --> 08:12.366
<i>Ling Xiaoyu versus Nina Williams.</i>
<i>Two-minute warning.</i>

08:13.451 --> 08:17.413
I… better get going.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.374
Yeah. Same.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.602
Be careful, Xiaoyu.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.855
Williams is a killer.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.399
She doesn't look too dangerous.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.319
She's literally a hired killer.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.030
That's what she does for a living.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.282
It's gonna be so disappointing for her

08:53.366 --> 08:55.868
when she's defeated
by a high school kid, huh?

08:55.952 --> 08:58.788
-Hmm.
-That's the spirit.

08:58.871 --> 08:59.872
Hwoarang!

09:00.581 --> 09:02.458
Both of my cheerleaders are here.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.128
She's so serious.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.549
Almost as serious as you, Jin.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.593
I'm gonna use the prize money
to open an amusement park.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.930
I'll invite you and Nina
to see if you ever let yourselves smile.

09:18.641 --> 09:24.105
<i>Nina Williams versus Ling Xiaoyu.</i>

09:24.188 --> 09:25.189
Begin!

09:32.071 --> 09:34.073
Dirty trick, Nina.

09:34.156 --> 09:37.285
We're here to fight, not play!

09:41.956 --> 09:44.125
You shouldn't have let her compete.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.710
She's just a kid.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.380
And what does that make you?

09:50.506 --> 09:52.216
[Nina grunting

09:55.511 --> 09:57.680
Hmm. Is that all you got?

09:58.598 --> 09:59.432
Hmm!

10:00.766 --> 10:03.894
The difference between you and Xiaoyu

10:05.146 --> 10:08.941
is that she spends more time
thinking about strategy

10:09.025 --> 10:12.820
than she does feeling sorry for herself.

10:25.082 --> 10:28.169
A seasoned fighter
can see that Xiaoyu

10:28.252 --> 10:31.881
is letting her opponent tire herself out.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.514
She makes up for her small size
and lack of power

10:41.140 --> 10:42.475
with strategy.

10:43.017 --> 10:48.939
I wonder which strategy
she's worked out for defeating you.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.471
Light outs, little girl.

11:44.620 --> 11:49.417
<i>Winner by knockout, Ling Xiaoyu!</i>

11:49.500 --> 11:51.043
-Hmm.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.343
Hmm.

12:31.292 --> 12:35.004
Great, golden boy's paying me a visit.

12:36.922 --> 12:37.798
Down, girl.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.886
I don't blame you, but calm down.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.849
What do you want?

12:46.932 --> 12:48.976
How's the leg?

12:49.059 --> 12:50.936
I'll tell you how, broken.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.482
I'll be lucky to walk again,
let alone fight on it.

12:54.565 --> 13:00.112
You'll have to adjust your fighting style
to counter for it.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.948
Well, thank you
for the words of encouragement.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.161
And since when
does one of Heihachi's thugs

13:07.244 --> 13:08.746
check in on an opponent?

13:08.829 --> 13:11.999
I'm not one of Heihachi's thugs.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.668
Then why is Heihachi taking you on?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.671
Why'd he work so hard to train you?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.927
It's… personal.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.929
Hmm. Yeah.

13:25.888 --> 13:29.266
Well, winning this tournament
is personal for all of us.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.643
Yeah.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.520
Guess so.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.690
You know what the problem
with you is, Kazama?

13:36.774 --> 13:38.943
You've been swimming with sharks so long,

13:39.026 --> 13:42.196
you don't know the good guys
from the bad guys.

13:42.279 --> 13:45.491
Let me tell you something
about Heihachi Mishima.

13:46.408 --> 13:49.954
He's just using you
like the Mishimas use everyone.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.040
You ever lose real family, Kazama?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.084
I have.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.379
And I lost them all because of one man,

13:59.046 --> 14:03.425
the same man you've been training with
to win this tournament.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.556
Clearly, he didn't train you how to act,

14:09.807 --> 14:12.726
'cause you wouldn't be worried
about my leg if he did.

14:14.353 --> 14:18.315
You are correct, Mr. Smith.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.872
If Kazama learned anything from me,

14:33.581 --> 14:36.166
he'd be preparing for his next fight

14:36.709 --> 14:40.796
instead of wasting his time on you.

14:44.091 --> 14:44.925
Go.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.386
Now.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.263
I'm not finished, Heihachi.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.723
Not even close.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.477
I'll be back for you… one day.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.522
To be worthy of my time,

14:59.189 --> 15:03.360
you must do more than lose fights.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.034
Hmm.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.952
Don't worry, Sugar.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.914
We'll get him back.

15:25.507 --> 15:28.010
Had your mother defeated Ogre,

15:28.761 --> 15:33.390
would she have visited him later
to ask how he was feeling?

15:35.351 --> 15:38.979
Every time you fight, it is with Ogre.

15:39.813 --> 15:45.402
Every opponent you defeat
is one step closer to defeating Ogre.

15:46.403 --> 15:49.156
To win King of Iron Fist,

15:49.239 --> 15:54.328
you must shed every ounce of weakness
your mother has instilled in you.

15:55.204 --> 16:00.459
It is the only way to avenge her.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.129
<i>Win your next fight</i>

16:04.672 --> 16:09.051
<i>and do not look back.</i>

16:22.523 --> 16:25.985
-Guess we finally get that rematch.

16:28.612 --> 16:32.866
<i>Jin Kazama versus Hwoarang.</i>

16:32.950 --> 16:33.784
Kazama.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.244
Hwoarang.

16:35.744 --> 16:36.662
To the center!

16:37.162 --> 16:37.997
Bow.

16:39.748 --> 16:40.916
No holding back.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.378
No hard feelings, right?

16:44.962 --> 16:47.214
I did want to hurt them.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.801
You lost the fight
with yourself, Jin.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.638
The battle against your anger.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.099
You know you're better than that.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.064
Begin!

17:21.457 --> 17:24.877
You should never take pleasure
in the suffering of others.

17:32.509 --> 17:36.430
<i>You must not only fight</i>
<i>as a Mishima</i>

17:36.513 --> 17:40.434
<i>but also win as Mishima.</i>

17:40.517 --> 17:43.437
<i>Every opponent you defeat</i>

17:43.520 --> 17:48.942
<i>is one step closer to defeating Ogre.</i>

18:27.231 --> 18:28.065
Hmm.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.313
Winner buys the beers.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.565
-Fair enough?

19:54.234 --> 19:57.154
<i>Winner, Jin Kazama!</i>

20:05.495 --> 20:07.164
Hmm.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.459
-Yeah.

20:14.463 --> 20:18.842
Okay, for real, I never want
to see you two fight again.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.720
I, uh… I want a rematch.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.224
After the beer.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.852
-Stop it.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.146
You both have to get cleaned up fast.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.859
I heard Paul Phoenix
is fighting a grizzly bear next.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.361
A grizzly bear.
