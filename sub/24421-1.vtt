02:50.709 --> 02:52.208
Good morning, babe.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.351
Wow.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.575
Yeah, gonna ramp things up.
Iron Man is in three months.

02:58.959 --> 03:00.518
You look like an
eight-year-old boy,

03:00.542 --> 03:01.917
going from hobby to hobby.

03:02.458 --> 03:04.017
I wish you'd focus
your attention

03:04.041 --> 03:06.041
on something else.

03:06.959 --> 03:07.959
Like your career.

03:08.959 --> 03:09.959
Joel, gross!

03:13.083 --> 03:14.083
Where is the coffee?

03:14.959 --> 03:16.583
Where is my coffee maker?

03:17.750 --> 03:18.750
Ew!

03:19.083 --> 03:20.125
That's not good for you.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.434
And you're way too jittery
when you're on it.

03:22.458 --> 03:25.625
What? That's when I
don't have my coffee!

03:25.959 --> 03:28.208
Besides, it clashes
with the kitchen.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.166
It's an esthetics thing.

03:33.083 --> 03:35.083
Breakfast! I'm starving!

03:35.959 --> 03:37.417
Did you study your spelling?

03:38.583 --> 03:39.917
Albuquerque.

03:40.959 --> 03:45.291
A-L-B-U...

03:46.166 --> 03:47.250
cookie?

03:48.750 --> 03:51.417
Come on, mom! You're not
getting any younger!

03:51.959 --> 03:54.000
That's what abuelita says.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, well, abuelita is crazy.

03:57.291 --> 03:58.291
There you go!

03:59.750 --> 04:00.917
Ok, now try it.

04:03.166 --> 04:05.476
See, my daughter might
not know how to spell,

04:05.500 --> 04:07.000
but she sure has good taste.

04:07.333 --> 04:10.083
Remember how you used to
not like sweet potatoes?

04:11.166 --> 04:13.458
And kale? And beets?

04:13.792 --> 04:14.875
Come on, mommy!

04:16.333 --> 04:18.810
You like it, right?
You do like it.

04:18.834 --> 04:19.834
I love it.

04:20.834 --> 04:23.667
See? La comida es
amor, chiquita.

04:35.959 --> 04:38.667
What are you getting from all
this juicing and training?

04:39.458 --> 04:41.000
I don't know. Purpose?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Food is fuel.

04:43.792 --> 04:45.291
So is caffeine.

05:11.834 --> 05:14.875
We've got big things cooking
here at Tortilla Hut.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.226
And whoever said
size doesn't matter,

05:18.250 --> 05:21.041
obviously never tried our
beefy beany burrito.

05:22.834 --> 05:24.142
Tortilla Hut,

05:24.166 --> 05:26.166
where everything is
bigger and better.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.333
Babe, did you see that?

05:31.208 --> 05:32.810
Sorry, boss.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.142
It's just that little
guy cracks me up.

05:34.166 --> 05:36.393
I hate to say it, but
my kids eat there too.

05:36.417 --> 05:39.101
I mean, where else can you
get five tacos for $0.99?

05:39.125 --> 05:41.226
Nowhere. And that
should be the point.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.393
You want quality, you
need to pay for it.

05:44.709 --> 05:46.125
Ándale, a trabajar.

05:53.041 --> 05:54.125
Better.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.083
Where are we with the
crema de chile poblano?

05:58.542 --> 06:00.601
We can't make crema
de chile poblano

06:00.625 --> 06:01.625
with no chiles.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.226
Chin, ¡se me olvido!

06:04.250 --> 06:05.351
Are you sure you don't need

06:05.375 --> 06:06.695
an extra hand in
your chile field?

06:07.500 --> 06:09.060
Don't worry, your
secret's safe with me.

06:11.625 --> 06:12.685
If anyone asks,

06:12.709 --> 06:14.851
I went to town for supplies, ok?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.792
- Turn it off, Gonzalo.
- Ok.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.625
- Turn it off, I can hear it!

06:21.291 --> 06:22.393
Well, personally,

06:22.417 --> 06:24.643
I think we should
make TH more hip,

06:24.667 --> 06:26.333
appeal to the Millennials.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.893
Yeah, no, I call it TH.
Do you like that?

06:30.917 --> 06:32.726
Having phone sex
with my dad again?

06:32.750 --> 06:33.851
You know, Mr. Flanagan,

06:33.875 --> 06:35.226
your son actually
just walked in.

06:35.250 --> 06:36.792
Yeah, no, here he is.

06:37.291 --> 06:38.291
Hey, dad.

06:38.959 --> 06:40.059
Yeah!

06:40.083 --> 06:42.059
Aha, aha.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.166
You know...

06:44.458 --> 06:45.309
yes, speaking of what I
should be doing with my life,

06:45.333 --> 06:46.518
I really should
get back to work,

06:46.542 --> 06:49.226
because there's a new
product meeting.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.893
They just pushed to 10 a.m.

06:50.917 --> 06:52.250
Yeah, Aaron just told me.

06:53.917 --> 06:55.101
Yeah, I can't wait to go.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.726
Yeah, no, it's gonna be
the best part of my day.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.166
Ok, love you, bye.

06:59.959 --> 07:01.000
Thanks, Aaron.

07:08.709 --> 07:09.768
Hey, buddy.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.272
He'll be late for the
product meeting.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.500
Oh...

07:14.125 --> 07:15.476
Yeah.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.810
You know I only took this
assistant gig because I thought

07:16.834 --> 07:20.935
he'd hardly be here and I'd
have a shot at a promotion.

07:20.959 --> 07:22.976
I heard the family is
putting pressure on him,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.142
but I'm sure he's
gonna continue to do

07:24.166 --> 07:26.458
that bare minimum
that he does, so...

07:26.709 --> 07:29.000
Yeah, but what if he
starts to actually...

07:29.333 --> 07:30.500
you know, work?

07:31.667 --> 07:32.810
- Give me your jacket, come on.
- Seriously?

07:32.834 --> 07:33.518
- Do it, come on.
- You're kidding me!

07:33.542 --> 07:35.000
I'll bring it back.

07:36.333 --> 07:37.333
What was that?

07:39.166 --> 07:40.875
I wouldn't worry about that.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.500
Good morning, everyone.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.017
Oh! Look at who showed up.

07:50.041 --> 07:51.226
Don't get too excited, sis.

07:51.250 --> 07:54.017
I just didn't want to
talk to our father.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.500
So, I'm sure everyone
has seen the headlines.

07:56.750 --> 07:57.750
We have?

08:01.542 --> 08:04.208
Oh, dad's not gonna like that!

08:05.417 --> 08:07.393
No. We have to face the facts.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.017
Tastes are evolving.

08:09.041 --> 08:12.351
Our customers want
artisanal food

08:12.375 --> 08:15.226
and authentic experience.

08:15.250 --> 08:18.309
Sophistication has come
to Small Town, America.

08:18.333 --> 08:22.184
And we need to evolve
right alongside.

08:22.208 --> 08:24.601
So, that only means one
thing for Tortilla Hut:

08:24.625 --> 08:26.125
menu diversity.

08:27.041 --> 08:29.559
We have been coasting
for far too long,

08:29.583 --> 08:32.058
we need to get out
there in the field,

08:32.082 --> 08:33.457
and see what's cooking.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.267
So Brian,

08:35.291 --> 08:37.351
I need you to take
the East Coast.

08:37.375 --> 08:38.643
- Yep.
- And Megan,

08:38.667 --> 08:40.433
there's some great stuff
happening in Chicago

08:40.457 --> 08:42.017
and in the Northwest.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.017
And Joel, I spoke to
father about this,

08:44.041 --> 08:46.226
and he wants you to
handle the Southwest.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.417
No problemo.

08:48.750 --> 08:49.976
Which means you will be
travelling to the Southwest

08:50.000 --> 08:52.208
and handling all research
and development.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.184
I want you slumming it.

08:54.208 --> 08:56.851
In every hole in the
wall, every hidden gem,

08:56.875 --> 08:59.917
sampling as much of the
regional food as it takes,

09:00.208 --> 09:02.542
until we find our
next big product.

09:02.792 --> 09:03.792
What?

09:04.250 --> 09:05.250
No way! That's like...

09:07.083 --> 09:08.434
work. That's like, real work.

09:08.458 --> 09:09.750
Send her!

09:10.500 --> 09:12.601
Gina is on maternity leave

09:12.625 --> 09:14.101
starting next week, so...

09:14.125 --> 09:16.101
I'm training for a triathlon,
that's like having a baby,

09:16.125 --> 09:17.500
except it's actually
good for you.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.643
Stacey, why don't you let
me take over the territory?

09:20.667 --> 09:22.434
I mean, it's a very
viable region,

09:22.458 --> 09:26.434
and, "también, yo hablo
mucho de español."

09:26.458 --> 09:29.226
Yeah, let him do it.
Let this guy...

09:29.250 --> 09:30.267
Brian.

09:30.291 --> 09:31.476
Whatever.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.351
Joel,

09:32.375 --> 09:34.101
I want you to handle this.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.458
And I think that grandpop

09:36.083 --> 09:38.226
would have wanted you to
get back to your roots.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.267
Roots?

09:39.291 --> 09:40.291
What roots?

09:40.750 --> 09:42.250
I'm from Laguna Niguel.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.643
I'm eating clean right now.

09:45.667 --> 09:46.768
I can't eat junk.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.142
Well, that's good,

09:48.166 --> 09:50.518
because I want you to focus
on New Mexican cuisine.

09:50.542 --> 09:52.476
I can't each cheese!
I can't eat fats,

09:52.500 --> 09:53.810
I can't even eat good fats.

09:53.834 --> 09:54.976
I don't remember the last
time I had an avocado.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.518
And Let's face it: I
hate Mexican food.

09:58.542 --> 10:01.625
And that's not my fault, because
I have a Jewish stomach.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.792
Which is odd, because
we're Irish.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.792
Never said it made sense.

10:08.291 --> 10:09.333
All right, any questions?

10:16.333 --> 10:19.458
- Why aren't you in school?
- We had a half day, remember?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.834
Right.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.041
You know, I could help
if you would let me.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.393
You can't help roast
the chiles, chiquita.

10:29.417 --> 10:32.250
What's the big deal?
They're just chiles!

10:33.583 --> 10:35.667
- Just chiles?
- Yeah.

10:37.542 --> 10:39.667
Maybe it's time you learn
about your legacy.

10:43.709 --> 10:44.709
Ok.

10:45.417 --> 10:46.583
Your legacy.

10:47.959 --> 10:50.476
A legacy is something special
that's in your family.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.309
It's a part of you, and
not everyone has it.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.417
- So it's only special to us?
- Oh, yeah.

10:56.709 --> 10:58.667
This is our family secret.

10:59.375 --> 11:00.434
Ok?

11:00.458 --> 11:02.559
- You can't tell anyone.
- I pinky swear.

11:02.583 --> 11:04.583
Pinky swear? I'm trusting you.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.166
All right.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.250
So, it goes like this.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.417
A long, long time ago,

11:12.625 --> 11:16.017
your
great-great-great-grandfather

11:16.041 --> 11:17.393
made a bet.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.709
With a very wise man.

11:20.417 --> 11:22.709
His name was Fabian Garcia.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.518
And he would become known

11:25.542 --> 11:29.851
as the inventor of the
New Mexico green chile.

11:29.875 --> 11:30.875
Cool.

11:32.542 --> 11:33.893
- But at the time,

11:33.917 --> 11:36.351
Mr. Garcia was just
a penniless farmer.

11:36.375 --> 11:38.083
He had no money to give.

11:38.375 --> 11:39.750
- That's not right.

11:41.083 --> 11:42.643
- But he had something
better, chiquita.

11:43.375 --> 11:44.875
He had seeds.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.667
These chile seeds

11:51.250 --> 11:53.559
have been passed on
through the generations.

11:53.583 --> 11:56.750
And one day, they
will pass on to you.

12:02.083 --> 12:04.393
Is this why your
cooking is so good?

12:04.417 --> 12:05.583
Hey!

12:10.458 --> 12:12.393
You totally ambushed
me back there!

12:12.417 --> 12:14.500
All right, all right.
Just sit down.

12:17.625 --> 12:19.601
It's time to get serious, Joel.

12:19.625 --> 12:20.601
Look at me.

12:20.625 --> 12:21.810
I am serious.

12:21.834 --> 12:25.393
About not going to
Arizona or New Mexico?

12:25.417 --> 12:27.976
Wherever you told me to go.
What do I look like?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.226
I'm not a Southwestern guy.

12:30.250 --> 12:34.476
And I'm busy! I've got work.
My law practice?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.810
Occasional client who is one
of daddy's golfing buddies

12:36.834 --> 12:39.542
- does not a lawyer make.
- It's only one of them.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.792
What do you wanna
do with your life?

12:44.125 --> 12:47.685
The lease on all your toys and
lifestyle is going to run out

12:47.709 --> 12:48.935
if you don't make
a smart choice.

12:48.959 --> 12:51.500
And you know of the
terms of the estate.

12:52.667 --> 12:55.834
Why don't you just commit
to a year of Tortilla Hut?

12:56.709 --> 12:58.000
What is stopping you?

13:00.333 --> 13:02.375
You said that grandpa
was your hero.

13:03.125 --> 13:05.017
Well he went to war, came back,

13:05.041 --> 13:07.959
and started a $500
million enterprise.

13:09.291 --> 13:10.959
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

13:14.166 --> 13:15.667
Let's be honest, sis.

13:16.750 --> 13:17.875
It's just junk food.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.667
It's the family business.

13:24.166 --> 13:27.208
And in my book, that's not junk.

13:52.917 --> 13:54.643
Oh, good! You already packed.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.417
So, you got my text
after all, I mean...

14:01.709 --> 14:02.875
What's going on?

14:03.917 --> 14:06.083
I'm enjoying my coffee.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.875
You know, that's really
not good for you.

14:11.542 --> 14:12.625
Oh, I know, Joel.

14:15.208 --> 14:16.750
And I'm done.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.601
Done? What do you mean done?

14:19.625 --> 14:21.542
You're coming with
me to New Mexico!

14:21.750 --> 14:23.709
You're gonna have to do
this one on your own.

14:23.917 --> 14:26.559
You know, not everything
revolves around you, Joel.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.726
You know, for the
last two years,

14:28.750 --> 14:30.559
we've done everything.
Everything that you've wanted.

14:30.583 --> 14:31.851
We've gone on dates
with your friends,

14:31.875 --> 14:34.017
and you've told me what to
wear, and what to drink...

14:34.041 --> 14:35.393
- Because you asked!
- And now you're obsessed

14:35.417 --> 14:40.333
with trying to be Iron Man.
- No, I'm trying to do Iron Man!

14:43.417 --> 14:45.393
Have you ever, ever,

14:45.417 --> 14:46.750
thought about what I wanted?

14:49.417 --> 14:51.083
What do you want, Lauren?

14:52.750 --> 14:53.750
I want...

14:54.542 --> 14:55.834
someone who can make me laugh.

14:56.959 --> 14:59.500
I never said I was a
freaking comedian.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.750
You know what I mean.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.458
I'm funny.

15:40.709 --> 15:43.625
Ay, I'm not getting any younger!

16:00.917 --> 16:03.583
I'll be right with you, ok?
Is it good? Yes?

16:04.083 --> 16:05.375
There we go!

16:05.875 --> 16:07.208
Cordelia!

16:07.709 --> 16:09.709
Always a sight for sore eyes.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.208
Hey, doesn't the new
sign look great?

16:12.667 --> 16:14.101
Preciosa.

16:14.125 --> 16:17.375
Hey, did Javiera tell you
the new tour just sold out?

16:17.750 --> 16:18.726
- Really?
- Yeah!

16:18.750 --> 16:20.184
Well, that's very good.

16:20.208 --> 16:23.750
Your daughter is becoming
quite the little rockstar.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.750
Just like her old lady.

16:26.709 --> 16:29.917
- Where is my little pinto bean?
- Oh, Lord.

16:30.875 --> 16:32.917
Let him get run over by a truck.

16:34.667 --> 16:38.142
Ok, maybe not. Maybe a tractor.

16:38.166 --> 16:39.750
He could survive
the truck, right?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.559
Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!

16:42.583 --> 16:44.417
Babe, it's me.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.351
It went straight to voicemail.

16:46.375 --> 16:47.851
In that way where
you have the choice

16:47.875 --> 16:49.226
whether to take the call or not.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.559
Anyway, I was thinking
about what you were saying

16:50.583 --> 16:54.726
about how you think everything
revolves around me.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.351
But remember when we
went down to San Diego

16:57.375 --> 16:59.059
for that frisbee
golf competition

16:59.083 --> 17:00.434
and you left early

17:00.458 --> 17:02.685
because your mom got sick
and went to the hospital

17:02.709 --> 17:05.935
and I won that night? And I
never made it a big deal.

17:05.959 --> 17:08.267
I was really disappointed,
but I didn't bring it up.

17:08.290 --> 17:11.709
And we both know people can
live without their appendix!

17:13.875 --> 17:15.959
Actually, that's probably
not a good example.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.351
Listen, I want...

17:17.375 --> 17:18.768
- The mailbox is full

17:18.791 --> 17:20.518
and cannot accept any
messages at this time.

17:20.541 --> 17:21.541
Good bye!

17:28.583 --> 17:30.893
Javi, nobody makes chile
sauce like you have.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.083
No one!

17:34.000 --> 17:34.893
You know what?

17:34.917 --> 17:36.125
This is just the beginning.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.601
I mean, with the
success of the cafe,

17:38.625 --> 17:40.309
we can look towards a real
restaurant in Santa Fe.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.935
I've been there, done that.

17:41.959 --> 17:43.601
Yeah, but that was Albuquerque.

17:43.625 --> 17:44.893
You know?

17:44.917 --> 17:46.976
I'm talking about something
big here, right?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.250
We're building a brand!

17:48.583 --> 17:51.083
I see a cooking show

17:51.625 --> 17:53.458
and a whole line of products

17:53.834 --> 17:55.559
starting with your
signature dish.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.976
I'm still getting
used to the new sign.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.434
Don't you think it's a bit much?

17:59.458 --> 18:02.101
Come on, you gotta shake
things up a little bit, baby!

18:02.125 --> 18:04.875
No, I like things
the way they are.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Static?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Timeless.

18:39.625 --> 18:40.976
Passing through,

18:41.000 --> 18:42.309
I'm wondering if there's a good
place to grab a bite to eat.

18:42.333 --> 18:45.125
Sure, there's a Tortilla
Hut just down the road.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.851
But if you're looking
for a real gem,

18:48.875 --> 18:51.017
go down the road
about five miles

18:51.041 --> 18:53.017
and make a right at the
first four-way stop.

18:53.041 --> 18:55.542
- You can't miss it.
- Thank you so much.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.083
Oh, Joel.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.309
That's like discovering
the hamburger.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.583
Green chile is practically
the state dish.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.017
- What are you talking
about, Stacey?

19:25.041 --> 19:26.333
It's freaking fantastic!

19:27.583 --> 19:30.685
It's got green chile,
pinto beans, and chicken!

19:30.709 --> 19:32.375
It's not even bad for you.

19:32.875 --> 19:36.041
Beans give you fiber,
chicken is protein,

19:37.083 --> 19:39.059
and green chile is a vegetable.
Done!

19:39.083 --> 19:40.518
And how would we package it?

19:40.542 --> 19:41.685
You're not thinking.

19:41.709 --> 19:42.685
- Do you really think

19:42.709 --> 19:43.893
our consumer base

19:43.917 --> 19:46.434
is concerned with your
authenticity obsession?

19:46.458 --> 19:48.685
- Hank, don't fill
up on junk food!

19:48.709 --> 19:51.267
The only people who order tacos
from a drive-through window

19:51.291 --> 19:53.417
are stoners and big, fat...

19:55.375 --> 19:58.518
I mean, somewhat
slightly obese people,

19:58.542 --> 20:01.083
who I'm sure are lovely
people on the inside.

20:02.041 --> 20:04.583
This is a lot harder
than it looks, ok?

20:05.709 --> 20:07.434
It's not exactly
written on a sign

20:07.458 --> 20:10.250
where to find the best
food in New Mexico.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.250
Let me call you right back.

20:27.291 --> 20:29.935
See, we've got a whole variety
of different types of peppers.

20:29.959 --> 20:32.935
They come in all different
shapes, sizes, colors.

20:32.959 --> 20:35.559
But this one, right here,
the New Mexico green chile,

20:35.583 --> 20:37.101
that's what we're
roasting right here.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.250
Isn't that smell amazing?

20:39.583 --> 20:41.726
You're gonna see everything
that you could possibly imagine

20:41.750 --> 20:43.559
from the chile family
in New Mexico.

20:43.583 --> 20:45.893
But it's really the green
chile that is the star.

20:45.917 --> 20:48.458
This is what has become
the local favorite.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.309
Save your appetite
for Javiera's,

20:54.333 --> 20:56.000
cooking up her signature dish!

21:18.959 --> 21:20.667
All right, here we go.

21:27.834 --> 21:29.834
We've got a real
treat here, huh?

22:25.625 --> 22:28.208
I told you it was worth
the wait, right?

22:29.041 --> 22:30.041
Enjoy!

22:31.250 --> 22:34.059
Hey, why don't you guys
try taking small bites,

22:34.083 --> 22:36.291
really savour this food.

22:40.875 --> 22:43.542
I'm tasting pork and
something else.

22:45.041 --> 22:48.226
Apples. Oh my God, apples!

22:48.250 --> 22:51.059
Perfect harmony of the
sweet and the savory.

22:51.083 --> 22:52.291
Just like life.

22:54.291 --> 22:58.333
And who knew garlic soup
actually tastes awesome?

23:04.333 --> 23:05.417
You got avocado?

23:07.291 --> 23:08.291
Perfect match.

23:09.333 --> 23:10.973
Sí, sí, los gringos,
los gringos llegaron.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.643
I've never seen such fancy
watches and purses.

23:14.667 --> 23:17.267
Let's hope they spend
some money in town.

23:17.291 --> 23:18.625
- I'm coming over.
- Ok.

23:20.750 --> 23:22.309
- Hello, young man!
- Hi!

23:22.333 --> 23:25.458
Hi. Why aren't you
with the group?

23:27.667 --> 23:29.226
You look triste.

23:29.250 --> 23:30.250
Sad.

23:31.291 --> 23:32.417
- I do?
- Yes.

23:33.917 --> 23:35.083
Muy triste.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.643
Oh, why?

23:38.667 --> 23:41.375
Why are you so triste? I
can feel your energy.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.768
My girlfriend just
broke up with me.

23:43.792 --> 23:45.000
We were pretty serious.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.142
- Oh, that's terrible!
- Terrible.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.518
Such a good looking
young man, huh?

23:50.542 --> 23:52.267
- Sí.
- Yes.

23:52.291 --> 23:54.875
And look, great physique.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.333
Yes.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.726
And nice clothes.

23:57.750 --> 24:00.309
You know what, nice
clothes means nice job.

24:00.333 --> 24:01.375
Yes.

24:02.709 --> 24:03.875
Pero triste.

24:04.709 --> 24:05.768
Why?

24:05.792 --> 24:07.500
Why did she leave you?

24:08.375 --> 24:10.000
Well, she...

24:10.792 --> 24:13.041
claimed I didn't make her laugh.

24:14.709 --> 24:15.709
No?

24:17.375 --> 24:19.309
It's crazy, right? I
mean, to leave someone,

24:19.333 --> 24:21.709
for this ridiculous
reason that's untrue?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.875
Come. Let's have some lunch.

24:24.208 --> 24:26.667
Forget your troubles
with some good food.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.976
- That's great.
- Come on!

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Ok.

24:32.750 --> 24:34.208
- Órale, órale. See you later.

24:38.375 --> 24:40.709
I'm sorry, are you
with the tour?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.333
Gonzalo, Gonzalo,
have pity on him.

24:44.834 --> 24:47.208
His fiancee... lo abandonó.

24:49.041 --> 24:50.041
Sorry, bro.

24:50.709 --> 24:51.875
What do you want me to do?

24:53.041 --> 24:54.309
The orders are even,
and you know Javiera.

24:54.333 --> 24:55.333
What's the matter?

24:56.375 --> 24:58.250
I just lost my appetite.

24:58.583 --> 25:00.875
What's wrong? Is there
anything wrong?

25:01.333 --> 25:02.559
Hey, pal!

25:02.583 --> 25:04.226
This is a private party.

25:04.250 --> 25:06.017
If he stays, we go.

25:06.041 --> 25:07.291
What am I hearing?

25:07.625 --> 25:08.810
What's going on here?

25:08.834 --> 25:11.184
They don't seem to
like you very much.

25:11.208 --> 25:12.208
I don't...

25:14.417 --> 25:15.417
Mamá.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.083
What's going on?

25:18.875 --> 25:20.291
No one is eating.

25:24.208 --> 25:26.851
I never make the wrong amount.

25:26.875 --> 25:29.208
Yeah, well, these things
happen every day.

25:29.792 --> 25:31.851
- For some, but not for me.
- Listen, lady.

25:31.875 --> 25:34.601
I'm just a guy who needs a meal.

25:34.625 --> 25:36.917
Maybe we could work
something out?

25:42.208 --> 25:44.434
You are a really funny
guy, you know that?

25:44.458 --> 25:45.959
Everyone satisfied?

25:46.625 --> 25:48.142
This bozo followed us in here,

25:48.166 --> 25:51.893
and now he's trying to eat all
of this amazing food for free.

25:51.917 --> 25:54.959
Sorry, sport. Who are you?

25:55.834 --> 25:58.166
Don't worry about it, Mr.
Mustache.

25:59.500 --> 26:00.500
What do you mean?

26:02.083 --> 26:03.291
He's not with the tour?

26:05.667 --> 26:06.959
And stay out!

26:11.083 --> 26:12.810
Sorry about your
lady friend, bro.

26:12.834 --> 26:13.959
Eat your feelings.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.476
So, I just tried something
pretty terrific.

26:39.500 --> 26:40.643
Acting like a human being?

26:43.500 --> 26:45.476
No! An empanada.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.643
I thought you couldn't
get on that tour.

26:47.667 --> 26:48.476
I have my ways.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.643
Listen, here's the thing.

26:49.667 --> 26:53.208
There's this woman,
Javiera Torres.

26:53.542 --> 26:54.726
And I think she may
be the real deal.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.518
Sounds like people
come from all around

26:56.542 --> 26:58.851
to try this signature
dish of hers.

26:58.875 --> 26:59.768
Haha.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.142
I smell marketing campaign.

27:01.166 --> 27:04.375
Tell me she's 80 years old,
full of wrinkles and character.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.208
Sort of.

27:07.542 --> 27:08.976
No, coffee. Is it coffee?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.685
Do you think we can
market her dish?

27:10.709 --> 27:11.851
Listen, don't kill me,

27:11.875 --> 27:14.709
but I haven't exactly
tried it yet.

27:15.542 --> 27:16.643
Hey.

27:16.667 --> 27:18.583
How did you let
that jerk get in?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.375
Look at the lengths people
are going to eat your food.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.542
It's starting, baby!

27:25.000 --> 27:27.041
Oh, Javiera, would
you stay a minute?

27:27.834 --> 27:31.083
Your dish is delicious. I
could eat it all the time.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.041
You make a terrific
frozen dinner.

27:34.417 --> 27:37.518
Could you share with us some
of your culinary secrets?

27:37.542 --> 27:38.542
Oh.

27:39.208 --> 27:40.709
How do you make love?

27:41.583 --> 27:42.351
What?

27:42.375 --> 27:43.375
From behind.

27:44.166 --> 27:46.041
It's sort of asking how I cook.

27:46.417 --> 27:48.834
It's personal.

27:50.542 --> 27:53.291
There are food blogs
dedicated to this woman.

27:53.583 --> 27:55.017
Joel, you have to go back!

27:55.041 --> 27:57.601
No, I'm done. I've
done my civic duty.

27:57.625 --> 27:58.726
Ok, listen.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.393
I have a really
big board meeting

28:00.417 --> 28:01.935
coming up in the next few weeks,

28:01.959 --> 28:03.875
and I need something
positive to report.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.542
I really need your
help here, Joel.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.351
And remember what
we talked about

28:08.375 --> 28:09.750
regarding your inheritance.

28:24.041 --> 28:25.250
Joel?

28:25.959 --> 28:26.959
Joel?

28:29.375 --> 28:30.375
Hello?

28:31.125 --> 28:32.500
Oh hey, buddy! How's New Mexico?

28:33.000 --> 28:34.559
Oh, hey Aaron.

28:34.583 --> 28:35.434
Question for you.

28:35.458 --> 28:36.810
Why did a highway patrolman

28:36.834 --> 28:39.059
just inform me that my
license has been suspended,

28:39.083 --> 28:41.959
and as a result, my car
is being towed away?

28:42.625 --> 28:44.559
Wow! That is... that's terrible.

28:44.583 --> 28:46.601
You know, I was sure...

28:46.625 --> 28:49.601
you know, that I sent in
that renewal paperwork.

28:49.625 --> 28:50.893
There is no doubt about it.

28:50.917 --> 28:53.393
Now I have to wait to
get in front of the DA

28:53.417 --> 28:55.059
to talk about a
temporary permit.

28:55.083 --> 28:56.768
This is all on you, pal.

28:56.792 --> 28:58.976
It's because of you,
I insulted a cop,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.434
and the tow truck driver,
although he deserved it.

29:01.458 --> 29:03.417
And now I can't even
get a ride into town!

29:22.625 --> 29:23.625
Seriously?

29:27.959 --> 29:29.208
Gone fishin'?

29:30.041 --> 29:31.267
With an apostrophe?

29:31.291 --> 29:32.625
Not fishing, I-N-G...

29:38.125 --> 29:39.333
Outstanding.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.685
- Listen, would you take
a look at these for me?

30:02.709 --> 30:05.208
Contracts? How romantic!

30:05.709 --> 30:06.893
I know, baby.

30:06.917 --> 30:08.834
But it's good to have
things in writing.

30:10.166 --> 30:11.685
You're gonna miss your tour bus.

30:11.709 --> 30:13.685
Do I look like a tourist to you?

30:13.709 --> 30:15.750
You sure don't look
like you belong here.

30:16.333 --> 30:17.643
- Amen, sister.
- Hey!

30:17.667 --> 30:19.059
Amen.

30:19.083 --> 30:21.851
Sophia, haven't I told you
not to talk to strangers?

30:21.875 --> 30:24.208
Hey, I'm really
not that strange.

30:24.750 --> 30:25.875
He's funny.

30:26.709 --> 30:27.810
Thanks, Junior!

30:27.834 --> 30:29.643
Is this man bothering
you, Sophie?

30:29.667 --> 30:31.208
My name is Sophia.

30:31.500 --> 30:32.583
And no, he's funny.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.893
It's not enough for
you to ruin my tour,

30:34.917 --> 30:37.726
now you have to come and
harass the locals too?

30:37.750 --> 30:39.875
- Hey, I was invited.
- By who?

30:43.792 --> 30:44.917
Well, that doesn't count.

30:46.041 --> 30:47.893
It's my tour and I want
you out of Villanueva.

30:47.917 --> 30:50.351
You always have your
man speak for you?

30:50.375 --> 30:52.351
This isn't just
about Kevin's tour,

30:52.375 --> 30:53.768
but my cafe.

30:53.792 --> 30:55.059
My cooking is my life,

30:55.083 --> 30:58.625
and I won't let anyone
make a mockery of it.

31:00.041 --> 31:02.417
Hey, don't look at me!

31:05.583 --> 31:07.625
Displaced anger, huh pal?

31:07.917 --> 31:09.083
Something like that.

31:25.792 --> 31:26.792
Gracias, Diego.

31:28.583 --> 31:30.917
I'll have what he had,
minus the flavor.

31:34.625 --> 31:36.667
You know sugar causes
cancer, right?

31:37.417 --> 31:38.417
Ok.

31:48.834 --> 31:50.083
I knew it!

31:50.625 --> 31:51.959
I missed everything.

31:52.834 --> 31:54.559
Does your face hurt much?

31:54.583 --> 31:56.768
Do you think you got
permanent brain damage?

31:56.792 --> 31:58.559
Like, one day, when you're 80,

31:58.583 --> 32:00.643
you'll wake up and not
even know who you are?

32:00.667 --> 32:01.810
Honestly, kid,

32:01.834 --> 32:03.959
I genuinely wish
that day were today.

32:04.458 --> 32:07.851
Listen, do you know any
hotels around here?

32:07.875 --> 32:09.685
Maybe like a Four
Seasons or something?

32:09.709 --> 32:12.267
Oh, Ermenda rents rooms out.
She owns a gift shop

32:12.291 --> 32:14.643
right across the street,
with like, the chiles.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.125
Sophia, ¡vámonos!

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Listen.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.768
I'm really not such
a bad guy here.

32:20.792 --> 32:22.142
Listen,

32:22.166 --> 32:24.434
whoever you are, I don't
know where you come from,

32:24.458 --> 32:26.685
but around here, everybody
looks out for each other.

32:26.709 --> 32:29.166
So, if I were you, I'd watch it.

32:30.125 --> 32:31.500
Mrs. Javiera?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.101
I couldn't help but notice

32:33.125 --> 32:34.643
that you were handling
some legal documents

32:34.667 --> 32:36.643
from your friend.

32:36.667 --> 32:38.333
- You're a lawyer?
- Yeah, I'm a lawyer.

32:38.625 --> 32:39.976
Figures.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.393
I would get a professional
look at those if I were you.

32:41.417 --> 32:44.017
You wouldn't wanna do anything
that you would regret.

32:44.041 --> 32:46.000
Like turning around
and talking to you?

32:46.834 --> 32:48.000
Good one, momma!

32:49.834 --> 32:51.750
What a cute town. It's great.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.417
- Hey, I've been
trying you for hours.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.518
Don't start with me, sis.
It's been the worst week.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.893
Yeah, I heard about Lauren.
Are you ok?

33:00.917 --> 33:02.810
I haven't had time
to process it.

33:02.834 --> 33:05.309
And I'm sure Aaron told
you, my good friend,

33:05.333 --> 33:07.142
that my car has been impounded,

33:07.166 --> 33:09.226
and I have to wait to
get in front of the DA,

33:09.250 --> 33:11.542
but he apparently
has gone fishi'n!

33:13.834 --> 33:15.685
I can hear you grin, sis.

33:15.709 --> 33:17.059
Being stuck in a town

33:17.083 --> 33:19.226
with one of the best regional
chefs in New Mexico?

33:19.250 --> 33:21.000
Now, why would I want that?

33:22.083 --> 33:23.417
Just like old times.

33:23.709 --> 33:25.041
My sister mocking me.

33:26.917 --> 33:30.184
I'm staring at a photo of the
marketing campaign we did.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.184
You were such a bad actor!

33:32.208 --> 33:34.458
That's because you made
me eat the product!

33:36.083 --> 33:37.768
Hi! Hold on, just a second.

33:37.792 --> 33:39.101
Yeah, but we had fun, didn't we?

33:39.125 --> 33:40.893
No, as I recall, you loved it,

33:40.917 --> 33:43.208
because you were always
daddy's little company girl.

33:47.917 --> 33:49.583
Oh, come on!

33:54.917 --> 33:56.041
It's charming.

33:57.709 --> 34:00.417
Didn't realize I was renting
a room from the Vatican.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.250
You sure I can't pay you online?

34:04.583 --> 34:06.834
I still use Windows 97.

34:16.833 --> 34:18.917
Are there any restaurants open?
I'm starving.

34:20.750 --> 34:23.833
We only have one
restaurant, Javiera's.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.625
And she's only open for lunch.

34:27.583 --> 34:29.958
Looks like you really
burned that bridge, huh?

34:30.417 --> 34:33.083
You have to integrate
yourself, muchacho.

34:35.417 --> 34:37.458
Maybe I'll go buy
some turquoise paint.

34:38.125 --> 34:39.458
Gonna get my suitcase.

34:48.792 --> 34:51.291
Hey! Watch it, jerk!

34:59.792 --> 35:01.667
Sorry, I didn't know it was you.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.518
You make it a habit of
calling people jerks?

35:03.542 --> 35:06.810
Well, you almost ran me over.
Listen, let's start over, huh?

35:06.834 --> 35:08.768
Shall we? I'm in
a bit of a bind.

35:08.792 --> 35:10.935
See, I am stuck here
until the DA comes back

35:10.959 --> 35:12.851
- from his fishing trip.
- Yes, so I heard.

35:12.875 --> 35:16.125
And I may starve to death.
How about a quid pro quo?

35:17.208 --> 35:18.976
I will look over your
boyfriend's contracts,

35:19.000 --> 35:20.935
- the guy with the mustache...
- Are you...?

35:20.959 --> 35:23.643
And in exchange, you
give me a great meal.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.208
How about that? Hey!

35:26.667 --> 35:28.987
A district attorney's fee is
300 dollars an hour, at least!

35:29.208 --> 35:30.542
I'd say that's a
pretty good deal.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.083
Think about it!

35:56.417 --> 35:57.417
Hello?

35:57.709 --> 35:58.810
Hey!

35:58.834 --> 36:01.000
I just wanted to
check in on you.

36:02.041 --> 36:04.559
I didn't get a chance to
explain those contracts

36:04.583 --> 36:08.917
before I left.
- I'm fine. How's your eye?

36:09.041 --> 36:10.250
It's still there.

36:11.458 --> 36:12.518
Listen, if that
asshole comes back...

36:12.542 --> 36:13.959
I should go.

36:15.291 --> 36:17.375
Sophia needs help
with her homework.

36:18.083 --> 36:19.083
Ok.

36:19.917 --> 36:21.208
- Night, baby.
- Good night.

36:27.709 --> 36:30.417
Hey! Flying to your man?

36:30.709 --> 36:32.250
He's not my man.

36:35.917 --> 36:37.959
All right, he's sort
of like my man.

36:38.875 --> 36:40.625
You know, Kevin...
Kevin is a good guy.

36:40.917 --> 36:43.125
He is fun, he's cute.

36:44.125 --> 36:46.017
And we sort of have
the same goals.

36:46.041 --> 36:48.583
Sort of is not good
enough for my daughter.

36:48.917 --> 36:52.893
Mama, I am a single mother
living in Villanueva.

36:52.917 --> 36:55.101
Population: 846.

36:55.125 --> 36:58.959
848! Tina had babies, twins.

36:59.583 --> 37:01.142
I stand corrected.

37:01.166 --> 37:02.417
848.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
My point is,

37:04.917 --> 37:07.417
sort of has become my...
fantastic.

37:07.750 --> 37:09.000
I'm ok with that.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.000
More importantly, I trust Kevin.

37:12.917 --> 37:13.959
- Sort of.
- Sort of.

37:21.583 --> 37:22.959
Who are you cooking for?

37:24.917 --> 37:26.792
Oh, please. That man is an ass.

37:27.291 --> 37:30.250
Yes, I saw his ass.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.893
And let me tell you
something about it:

37:32.917 --> 37:34.834
- I approve.
- Mama!

37:35.166 --> 37:37.667
- Take it, take it! Yeah!
- ¡Mamá!

37:38.208 --> 37:40.309
What did I miss?
What did I miss?

37:40.333 --> 37:42.875
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

37:43.208 --> 37:44.500
Here.

37:45.667 --> 37:48.041
Why don't you bring this
to your new best friend?

37:51.542 --> 37:53.500
Ay! Sophia!

38:08.000 --> 38:09.768
Wow, that's pretty good.

38:09.792 --> 38:11.792
It probably has a lot of
sugar in it though, right?

38:11.959 --> 38:13.142
It's actually all natural.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.351
Mango, pear, ginger,
with a bit of carrot

38:15.375 --> 38:17.333
to give it that unique zip.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.351
- You want me to take it back?
- Oh, no, no, thank you.

38:20.375 --> 38:21.875
It's...

38:23.375 --> 38:25.735
It's pretty perfect, actually.
You can't get that back home.

38:25.834 --> 38:28.166
- I'll tell you that.
- Where is that, Iceland?

38:29.208 --> 38:32.041
No, actually. I'm from
Irvine, California.

38:33.041 --> 38:35.333
Well, you probably can't
get this there, either.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.500
Dinner or breakfast?

38:40.166 --> 38:41.166
Sí?

38:42.041 --> 38:43.333
You know, I was...

38:44.375 --> 38:46.375
really hoping for
the house special.

38:47.417 --> 38:49.017
I only make that once a week,

38:49.041 --> 38:52.166
that's only for
family and friends.

39:08.709 --> 39:09.917
It's really good.

39:11.709 --> 39:12.917
Excuse me.

39:14.625 --> 39:16.291
- You like it?
- It's perfect.

39:18.041 --> 39:19.375
You wanna know a secret?

39:22.250 --> 39:24.375
I don't like Mexican food.

39:25.917 --> 39:27.125
Normally.

39:30.542 --> 39:31.750
But this is good.

39:32.917 --> 39:34.583
Are you sure it's Mexican food?

39:45.291 --> 39:46.291
Hey.

39:47.291 --> 39:49.559
So, it's a fairly basic
partnership agreement.

39:49.583 --> 39:51.101
You've agreed to partner
on a product line

39:51.125 --> 39:53.625
and a potential new
restaurant venture.

39:54.166 --> 39:55.792
Yes, but why the fairly?

39:56.083 --> 39:57.893
Well, I'm assuming
you agreed to this,

39:57.917 --> 40:00.125
but the percentage
of ownership...

40:01.917 --> 40:03.250
it's a 60-40 split.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.000
In your boyfriend's favor.

40:07.458 --> 40:09.698
I just wanted to make sure,
because it seems a bit askew.

40:09.917 --> 40:12.583
It seems pretty obvious that
you're the real asset here.

40:15.291 --> 40:17.226
Also, we should go over
division of net profits,

40:17.250 --> 40:19.333
- and equity compensation.
- It's fine.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.667
Also, there's something
you should know.

40:23.291 --> 40:27.291
Recipes aren't protected
under copyright law.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.208
Anyone can copy a chef's recipe.

40:30.542 --> 40:33.142
And I just wanted you
to be aware of that.

40:33.166 --> 40:34.625
What are you suggesting?

40:35.125 --> 40:37.291
That Kevin would steal my dish?

40:37.500 --> 40:38.667
No.

40:39.333 --> 40:40.500
No, no, no.

40:41.542 --> 40:43.309
From the little
that I know Kevin,

40:43.333 --> 40:45.142
he seems like a
real stand-up guy.

40:45.166 --> 40:47.309
And I might add, quite a catch.

40:47.333 --> 40:49.000
Is that your
professional opinion?

40:50.792 --> 40:51.792
Yes.

40:52.834 --> 40:55.000
Because your counsel
is no longer needed.

40:58.333 --> 40:59.333
Thanks for...

41:00.375 --> 41:01.667
dinner.

41:05.375 --> 41:06.667
He seems sad.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.500
You don't know him, chiquita.

41:10.208 --> 41:11.208
We don't know him.

41:12.333 --> 41:13.184
How are you supposed
to know somebody

41:13.208 --> 41:15.542
if you don't give them a chance?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.518
- Don't you ever go to school?
- It's feast day!

41:36.542 --> 41:38.643
Of course it is. What's that?

41:38.667 --> 41:40.351
Feast day of Saint Isidre.

41:40.375 --> 41:41.976
Patron saint of followers.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.917
We all pray for a good harvest.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.393
- And then what do you do?
- We eat!

41:46.417 --> 41:47.709
Of course you do.

41:49.875 --> 41:51.542
Why do you run so much?

41:52.041 --> 41:53.125
Because it's good for you.

41:53.625 --> 41:55.542
Besides, I'm training
for Iron Man.

41:56.291 --> 41:57.291
You know Iron Man?

41:58.583 --> 42:00.059
You're a pretty
literal kid, huh?

42:00.083 --> 42:03.017
Well, I'm a kid, and maybe
you're just not used to that.

42:03.041 --> 42:05.291
True. I'm not used to it at all.

42:06.041 --> 42:08.059
- Can I ask you a question?
- That was a question.

42:08.083 --> 42:10.351
- But yes, you can.
- Why did you hit Kevin?

42:10.375 --> 42:12.709
- Self-defense.
- Why did Kevin hit you?

42:14.208 --> 42:15.917
You'd have to ask him that.

42:17.208 --> 42:19.083
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

42:20.041 --> 42:21.291
Cheat on my LSATS.

42:22.875 --> 42:26.393
- How about you?
- Call my dad and hang up on him.

42:26.417 --> 42:28.434
I just wanted to hear his voice.

42:28.458 --> 42:30.434
He lives in Albuquerque
with his new wife

42:30.458 --> 42:31.893
and their brand new baby.

42:31.917 --> 42:34.059
He's my brother, but
when I look at him,

42:34.083 --> 42:35.750
I just see a big blob.

42:37.458 --> 42:39.417
What's the nicest thing
you've ever done?

42:41.458 --> 42:42.583
Yet to be determined.

42:43.917 --> 42:46.333
Does that mean you've never,
ever done anything nice?

42:47.125 --> 42:48.333
Means...

42:49.834 --> 42:51.434
maybe it means I haven't done
anything worth mentioning yet.

42:51.458 --> 42:52.750
Call it bum luck.

42:53.083 --> 42:54.434
I call that pathetic.

42:58.083 --> 42:59.250
Jesus.

43:30.333 --> 43:32.458
Look at that gringo eating goat!

43:34.125 --> 43:35.434
You're kidding, right?

43:35.458 --> 43:38.166
No, Mr. Handsome. It is goat.

43:39.333 --> 43:40.625
Who knew I liked goat?

43:41.917 --> 43:45.625
It's got this amazing smoky,
earthy thing going on.

43:46.500 --> 43:48.518
That's Javiera and her chiles.

43:48.542 --> 43:51.976
The Torres family are
known for their chiles.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.875
They win all the big awards.

43:54.166 --> 43:55.542
Where do they grow these chiles?

43:58.709 --> 44:02.333
Oh, sorry. Is that a thing? I
didn't know that was a thing.

44:03.333 --> 44:06.476
The key difference between a New
Mexican and Mexican cuisine

44:06.500 --> 44:08.518
is the way you use your chiles.

44:08.542 --> 44:11.142
You know? It can make
or break a dish.

44:11.166 --> 44:12.208
Including your daughter's?

44:12.542 --> 44:14.476
My daughter is a very good cook.

44:14.500 --> 44:15.643
Speaking of which,

44:15.667 --> 44:17.810
do I really have to
wait a full week

44:17.834 --> 44:19.101
for this signature dish of hers?

44:19.125 --> 44:21.875
- Couldn't I do something to...?
- Look at Mr. Charming.

44:22.709 --> 44:23.875
Don't push it.

44:25.041 --> 44:26.893
Javiera has been known
to skip for weeks

44:26.917 --> 44:28.500
if she's not feeling like it.

44:28.709 --> 44:30.875
Or if she's pissed off.

44:31.750 --> 44:32.601
Yeah.

44:32.625 --> 44:34.542
I bet she never gets pissed off.

44:51.583 --> 44:53.518
What could I do? Just tell me.

44:53.542 --> 44:55.017
He just showed up!

44:55.041 --> 44:56.726
Hija, I really don't
understand you.

44:56.750 --> 44:59.083
I mean, what's your problem?
He... he... he...

44:59.625 --> 45:00.625
Es muy guapo.

45:01.625 --> 45:03.935
Oh, looks? That's all
it takes for you?

45:03.959 --> 45:06.434
I think after papá you'd
learn your lesson!

45:06.458 --> 45:07.458
Shh!

45:08.583 --> 45:10.750
Yes, I had eight hellish
years with your papá.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.500
But the sex was fantástico.

45:14.500 --> 45:15.976
And that made up for it?

45:16.000 --> 45:19.267
Well, let me tell you something.
You know what, it did not hurt.

45:19.291 --> 45:22.667
Oh, and when it hurt,
it hurt so good.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.601
¡Qué pervertida eres, mamá!
Dale, dale, dale, dale.

45:25.625 --> 45:26.750
¡Ay!

45:35.667 --> 45:37.976
You know, I never thought
I was religious,

45:38.000 --> 45:39.500
but I like this church.

46:20.458 --> 46:22.434
- So, where's the middle?
- The universe?

46:22.458 --> 46:23.792
It's too big to tell.

46:24.500 --> 46:25.500
Just think.

46:26.208 --> 46:27.309
Before Galileo came along,

46:27.333 --> 46:29.643
people thought the Earth
was in the middle.

46:29.667 --> 46:30.834
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

46:31.834 --> 46:32.976
We all thought
that all the stars

46:33.000 --> 46:35.750
and the planets
revolved around us.

46:36.083 --> 46:37.083
Is it true?

46:37.667 --> 46:39.208
Are we out of beer?

46:41.875 --> 46:44.834
Galileo proved that we're
just a part of it all.

46:45.166 --> 46:47.059
- Huh, that's...
- Sucks.

46:47.083 --> 46:49.750
Let's face it, Galileo and
his stupid little telescope

46:50.166 --> 46:51.250
are total downers.

46:51.667 --> 46:53.208
Galileo was a hero.

46:53.542 --> 46:56.059
He was a man of great
integrity and honor.

46:56.083 --> 46:58.309
He went to jail for
what he believed.

46:58.333 --> 47:01.518
Yeah? Well, I'm stuck in
this dusty little town

47:01.542 --> 47:02.976
without a proper
workout facility.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.500
So, stuff happens.

47:04.750 --> 47:06.142
Listen, it sucks...

47:06.166 --> 47:08.518
that we're not the
center of the universe.

47:08.542 --> 47:10.500
It really, really sucks.
Who's with me?

47:10.709 --> 47:12.583
Me! Oh, yeah.

47:12.917 --> 47:13.893
Listen.

47:13.917 --> 47:15.059
Listen.

47:15.083 --> 47:17.041
Is there a 7/11 around here?

47:17.583 --> 47:20.250
Tell me this guy is not
our new science teacher.

47:20.542 --> 47:21.875
Siete/once?

47:22.917 --> 47:24.083
Anyone?

47:25.583 --> 47:26.750
Hey!

47:28.792 --> 47:31.583
Didn't anyone warn you about
the drinking and the altitude?

47:32.041 --> 47:33.184
Yeah.

47:33.208 --> 47:34.625
I got it with the attitude.

47:35.208 --> 47:36.583
Altitude.

47:36.959 --> 47:38.935
Hey, can I get a ride?

47:38.959 --> 47:39.893
- Oh.
- No.

47:39.917 --> 47:41.041
- Sure.
- No.

47:41.792 --> 47:43.559
No, not in my car!

47:43.583 --> 47:45.792
That is a sweet little
lady right there.

47:46.709 --> 47:49.417
- Is he drunk?
- Of course not.

47:51.917 --> 47:52.917
Really?

47:53.375 --> 47:54.726
Ok, maybe a little.

47:54.750 --> 47:56.685
Let this be a lesson for you.

47:56.709 --> 47:58.726
Don't drink and study astronomy.

47:58.750 --> 47:59.917
Don't drink!

48:00.792 --> 48:02.101
It turns you into a fool.

48:02.125 --> 48:05.142
But you said he was a fool
when he wasn't drunk.

48:05.166 --> 48:08.393
Why do I have a daughter that
questions me at every turn?

48:08.417 --> 48:09.726
Why do you say that?

48:11.709 --> 48:13.333
So how are you gonna
get him home?

48:13.792 --> 48:15.125
Well, that's a good question.

48:15.625 --> 48:17.917
Hey, wake up!

48:18.458 --> 48:20.125
Wake up, you crazy man!

48:20.750 --> 48:21.917
He's not waking up.

49:00.834 --> 49:04.125
I wrote, "Stay in the truck!"

49:04.792 --> 49:06.959
- Can't you read?
- Don't shout!

49:07.625 --> 49:08.959
My head is killing me.

49:10.709 --> 49:12.709
- Am I dead? Is this heaven?
- No.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.959
But this is clearly
my personal hell.

49:16.834 --> 49:18.792
This is your family
secret chile field.

49:19.208 --> 49:20.208
Isn't it?

49:21.333 --> 49:22.813
What do you know about
my chile field?

49:23.959 --> 49:25.851
Nothing. Look, you're the one
who dragged me here, ok?

49:25.875 --> 49:28.417
I tried to get you
out of my truck.

49:28.917 --> 49:30.101
I can't believe this.

49:30.125 --> 49:31.267
Only my family knows
about this place.

49:31.291 --> 49:33.309
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna tell anyone.

49:33.333 --> 49:34.476
Besides, I couldn't.

49:34.500 --> 49:35.940
I have no idea where
the hell we are.

49:37.875 --> 49:39.851
Wait. What are you doing?

49:39.875 --> 49:41.142
No, no, no. My
grandfather had a farm

49:41.166 --> 49:43.834
and I was a vegetarian
for years, it's fine.

49:48.500 --> 49:51.017
- Uh-uh.
- Wow, that's good!

49:51.041 --> 49:53.000
No eating the product.

49:58.083 --> 49:59.083
You said your...

49:59.875 --> 50:01.417
your grandfather was a farmer?

50:02.250 --> 50:03.685
He was an entrepreneur of sorts,

50:03.709 --> 50:05.893
but what I remember
most about him

50:05.917 --> 50:07.458
was how much he loved nature.

50:08.792 --> 50:10.726
He always told me not to
overcomplicate things,

50:10.750 --> 50:13.267
so the best ideas are
often the most simples.

50:13.291 --> 50:14.893
It's kind of his motto.

50:14.917 --> 50:15.917
It's like cooking.

50:16.834 --> 50:18.750
Sometimes the most
complex dishes can be...

50:18.959 --> 50:20.041
the most simple.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.625
You can't hide behind
your ingredients.

50:23.291 --> 50:24.291
Exactly!

50:24.750 --> 50:25.750
I think.

50:29.917 --> 50:32.250
Must be nice to have a
passion for something.

50:33.750 --> 50:35.417
You don't like being a lawyer?

50:36.750 --> 50:38.935
I wouldn't say it's a
calling, like your cooking.

50:38.959 --> 50:42.625
I wouldn't say my cooking is
a calling as much as it's...

50:43.375 --> 50:44.583
an instinct.

50:46.959 --> 50:48.834
- Instinct?
- Uh-huh.

50:51.417 --> 50:53.083
It sure is beautiful out here.

50:56.583 --> 50:59.226
It's like we're in the
center of the universe, huh?

50:59.250 --> 51:00.458
Galileo.

51:02.959 --> 51:04.625
- Cute.
- Uh-huh.

51:05.583 --> 51:06.625
Real cute.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.768
You know, just because I
have a bag over my head,

51:12.792 --> 51:15.000
doesn't mean I don't know
exactly where we are.

51:15.250 --> 51:17.810
Two right turns and
a stop sign, right?

51:17.834 --> 51:19.125
You forgot a sharp left.

51:19.625 --> 51:20.625
Oh!

51:22.417 --> 51:24.125
Ok, thank you, thank you.

51:24.417 --> 51:27.333
Listen, we seem to have
gone off on a bad start.

51:27.792 --> 51:30.500
How about I make it up to you?
You ever been in Santa Fe?

51:31.208 --> 51:32.500
Never heard of it.

51:33.625 --> 51:34.625
Ok, lame question.

51:34.959 --> 51:36.125
Well, I never have.

51:36.625 --> 51:37.768
I was just thinking...

51:37.792 --> 51:38.893
No!

51:38.917 --> 51:40.601
I'm not going on
a date with you.

51:40.625 --> 51:42.643
Good, because I'm
in a relationship.

51:42.667 --> 51:43.935
Oh, really?

51:43.959 --> 51:46.542
- I heard you were dumped.
- Ok, I got dumped.

51:47.625 --> 51:49.017
And you have a boyfriend.

51:49.041 --> 51:50.309
This would just be

51:50.333 --> 51:53.500
me taking you out to a
very expensive meal.

51:55.000 --> 51:55.893
Come on, my sister
just e-mailed me

51:55.917 --> 51:57.768
about this place in Santa Fe.

51:57.792 --> 51:58.792
It's new.

51:59.542 --> 52:00.768
I get my own culinary tour

52:00.792 --> 52:01.834
and you...

52:03.166 --> 52:05.086
would get to check out the
competition firsthand.

52:29.834 --> 52:31.875
What are you getting
all dressed up for?

52:34.500 --> 52:36.542
Just going to Santa Fe.

52:37.208 --> 52:38.875
Isn't Kevin in Tulsa?

52:39.667 --> 52:41.810
Sophia, will you
please go to the cafe

52:41.834 --> 52:44.542
and bring us some
eggs for tonight?

52:44.834 --> 52:46.083
I know what you're doing.

52:46.333 --> 52:47.333
Ándale.

52:47.667 --> 52:48.667
Ándale.

52:54.458 --> 52:55.583
Ándale, ándale.

52:56.083 --> 52:57.083
Te amo, chiquita.

52:59.709 --> 53:00.709
Ok.

53:09.875 --> 53:10.917
No, this one.

53:11.250 --> 53:12.893
- Keep this one.
- I just...

53:12.917 --> 53:14.875
I feel like it's so much skin.

53:15.709 --> 53:16.959
Are you a nun?

53:18.750 --> 53:19.476
Ok.

53:19.500 --> 53:21.083
Hold on, Stacey.

53:22.458 --> 53:23.458
Hello?

53:25.709 --> 53:27.851
I can't believe you're
making me do this.

53:27.875 --> 53:30.750
You are the one who reported
how great her chiles were.

53:31.125 --> 53:33.393
I don't think you and
your food scientists

53:33.417 --> 53:36.059
are gonna be able to reverse
engineer this one, sis.

53:36.083 --> 53:37.267
Yeah? Well, you just...

53:37.291 --> 53:39.125
let me worry about that, ok?

53:39.500 --> 53:42.166
I just need one sample, Joel.
Just one.

53:43.166 --> 53:44.166
Hello?

53:45.125 --> 53:46.125
Hello?

53:49.500 --> 53:51.000
Galileo!

53:51.750 --> 53:54.101
Great! You're calling
me that now?

53:54.125 --> 53:56.417
Everybody calls you that now.

53:57.959 --> 54:00.417
- So, what are you doing here?
- I...

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
Just hungry.

54:04.500 --> 54:05.935
Wait.

54:05.959 --> 54:08.267
I thought you were going to
have dinner with my mom.

54:08.291 --> 54:10.267
She got all dressed up
for you and everything.

54:10.291 --> 54:12.834
That's not fair! I
knew you first.

54:13.125 --> 54:16.518
I think you're gonna have a lot
of fancy dinners in your future.

54:16.542 --> 54:18.667
Hey, listen. Do me a favor?

54:18.959 --> 54:20.976
Don't tell your mom I was here.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.935
I wouldn't want her to think
that I ruined my dinner.

54:23.959 --> 54:24.959
Ok.

54:25.166 --> 54:26.166
So...

54:28.166 --> 54:29.166
Here.

54:30.542 --> 54:31.834
For your dumb luck.

54:32.166 --> 54:34.142
I think you mean bum luck?

54:34.166 --> 54:35.458
Yeah, that's what I said.

54:37.834 --> 54:39.935
- I'll see you later?
- Ok.

54:39.959 --> 54:41.142
- Have fun with my mom!
- See ya.

54:41.166 --> 54:43.208
- Bye!
- Bye!

54:55.208 --> 54:57.083
This isn't what you think it is.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.041
I didn't say anything.

55:01.250 --> 55:02.375
Where is he?

55:04.083 --> 55:05.375
This was a bad idea.

55:06.208 --> 55:08.226
- Sorry. I...
- Forgot?

55:08.250 --> 55:09.351
Definitely not.

55:09.375 --> 55:11.351
I just need a minute.

55:11.375 --> 55:13.333
Let's just get this
over with, huh?

55:14.375 --> 55:15.375
That's the spirit.

56:00.208 --> 56:03.226
Ok, I see we're gonna have to
set up some ground rules here.

56:03.250 --> 56:05.267
Number one, I'm
here for the meal.

56:05.291 --> 56:07.184
Everyone knows
Kevin in Santa Fe,

56:07.208 --> 56:09.583
and I would like to
experience dining like...

56:09.875 --> 56:11.101
like an anonymous civilian.

56:11.125 --> 56:13.017
Which is why I'm here
with you and not him.

56:13.041 --> 56:15.125
- Just to be clear.
- Clear.

56:15.625 --> 56:16.625
Number two.

56:17.709 --> 56:20.226
There will be no
post-dinner drinks.

56:20.250 --> 56:22.583
And definitely not drinks.

56:23.291 --> 56:24.768
What are you looking at?

56:24.792 --> 56:26.059
You're not the only one who
doesn't consider this a date.

56:26.083 --> 56:29.625
What makes you think you're
so damn desirable anyway?

56:30.291 --> 56:33.059
Ok, ok, fine. I'm not blind,

56:33.083 --> 56:35.267
but I'm a pretty
good catch myself.

56:35.291 --> 56:37.101
I mean, I'm a lawyer,

56:37.125 --> 56:38.625
I'm not ugly,

56:38.959 --> 56:40.625
I've got some dollars in the...

56:43.083 --> 56:45.250
- Hey, can you spare some change
- Charitable?

56:48.166 --> 56:50.935
- A guy can't have everything.
- Yeah, right.

56:50.959 --> 56:52.250
Just wouldn't be fair.

57:00.333 --> 57:02.667
Did you know oysters
are high in zinc?

57:03.375 --> 57:06.041
Did you know they also
raise your sperm count?

57:06.792 --> 57:07.834
Anyway. So...

57:08.333 --> 57:09.500
tell me about you.

57:10.667 --> 57:13.458
- This is not a date.
- This is not a date.

57:15.333 --> 57:18.101
All right. Well,
believe it or not,

57:18.125 --> 57:19.976
I used to own a
fancy restaurant.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.375
A bit like this one.

57:21.709 --> 57:23.458
In Albuquerque with my ex.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.291
- Sophia's dad?
- Uh-huh.

57:26.542 --> 57:28.351
Turns out that saying,

57:28.375 --> 57:30.309
"Too many cooks in the kitchen"?

57:30.333 --> 57:31.667
Not such a cliché.

57:34.625 --> 57:37.458
At first, it was
great, actually.

57:38.709 --> 57:40.309
Working side by side.

57:40.333 --> 57:42.417
Bradley was very
proud of me and...

57:43.000 --> 57:45.542
he would brag that I
could outcook him.

57:47.542 --> 57:49.559
And then the reviews
started to single me out,

57:49.583 --> 57:51.810
and people started
coming in for my dishes.

57:51.834 --> 57:53.184
My chile sauce.

57:53.208 --> 57:54.810
And uh...

57:54.834 --> 57:56.083
he cheated on me.

57:57.750 --> 57:59.184
We divorced,

57:59.208 --> 58:00.500
he married her.

58:01.375 --> 58:02.875
She's the stay-at-home type.

58:03.542 --> 58:04.893
Funny.

58:04.917 --> 58:07.250
She wasn't staying at home when
she was banging my husband.

58:07.750 --> 58:08.750
Bitch.

58:10.208 --> 58:11.208
Thank you.

58:12.166 --> 58:13.500
And now, you're with Kevin.

58:15.417 --> 58:17.041
Yeah. Uh-huh.

58:18.250 --> 58:19.250
Kevin.

58:20.542 --> 58:24.250
So, what about you? What's
your sad, sad story?

58:25.250 --> 58:26.250
What's your ex like?

58:26.875 --> 58:28.542
Well, she's attractive.

58:28.917 --> 58:30.291
- Shocking.

58:31.250 --> 58:33.750
I mean like, what does she do?

58:34.041 --> 58:35.041
Oh!

58:35.208 --> 58:36.250
Lauren's in marketing.

58:36.458 --> 58:38.083
Ok, marketing what?

58:38.375 --> 58:40.542
Branding and...

58:42.041 --> 58:43.291
stuff like that.

58:44.542 --> 58:45.601
You have no idea what
she does for a living.

58:45.625 --> 58:47.959
Our relationship
wasn't about that.

58:49.208 --> 58:51.291
- She was very supportive.
- Oh, I bet.

58:51.709 --> 58:52.917
Of you.

58:54.166 --> 58:55.017
Don't you think it's
important for two people

58:55.041 --> 58:57.375
to be supportive of one another?

58:58.375 --> 59:00.226
Would you like to hear
about our specials?

59:00.250 --> 59:01.250
Please!

59:02.417 --> 59:03.851
And I will be very
supportive of your decision.

59:03.875 --> 59:06.434
First, we have a lovely
pollo and pipian rojo.

59:06.458 --> 59:07.792
Oh, nice!

59:09.125 --> 59:11.005
That's chicken in red sauce
with pumpking seeds.

59:11.291 --> 59:13.166
I make that from time to time.

59:13.500 --> 59:15.309
We're also featuring
tonight a new dish,

59:15.333 --> 59:16.792
called Asado de puerco verde.

59:18.083 --> 59:19.393
It's a split-roasted pork
chop, stuffed with...

59:19.417 --> 59:21.059
Ground pork in pasote

59:21.083 --> 59:23.393
and served with
chile verde sickle?

59:23.417 --> 59:25.458
Why, I guess. Have you
been here before?

59:28.083 --> 59:29.083
Where are you going?

59:38.083 --> 59:39.184
¿Y los dueños?

59:39.208 --> 59:40.625
¿Los dueños no se
encuentran aquí?

59:41.709 --> 59:43.333
Don't look at me,
this isn't a date.

59:53.333 --> 59:54.333
Sorry.

59:58.667 --> 59:59.834
Javiera?

01:00:01.792 --> 01:00:03.000
Hey, what's wrong?

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.792
I need a drink.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.375
Man, I knew that foody
couple from the tour sucked.

01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:42.917
I feel badly.

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:44.667
Why?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.667
You didn't steal my dish.

01:00:48.709 --> 01:00:50.667
Your cooking is so
important to you.

01:00:52.166 --> 01:00:53.250
It means everything.

01:01:03.542 --> 01:01:05.083
Where did that come from?

01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:09.518
- You want me to take it back?
- No way.

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:18.458
What's in your pocket?

01:01:22.583 --> 01:01:23.726
Is that Sophia's?

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:25.184
She lent it to me.

01:01:25.208 --> 01:01:27.125
She thought I could
use the luck.

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:29.458
It's working, right?

01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:32.017
Well, well, well.

01:01:32.041 --> 01:01:33.417
I can't believe you.

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:35.583
And with this guy?

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:38.417
Is this about our
partnership agreement?

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:40.709
Are you trying to
sabotage our business?

01:01:43.417 --> 01:01:45.375
Is that what this is to you?

01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:47.625
A business agreement?

01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:49.917
You know we're more than that.

01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:51.917
I counted to 10.

01:01:52.583 --> 01:01:54.625
I said, wait 10 minutes.

01:01:54.917 --> 01:01:58.625
I thought you were
working in Tulsa.

01:01:59.458 --> 01:02:00.458
Alone.

01:02:01.625 --> 01:02:02.625
What's her problem?

01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:04.101
You think she was your...

01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:06.500
girl or s'... oh you dick.

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:08.750
Well, well, well.

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:10.625
Enough.

01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:12.500
No more hitting.

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:19.667
Are you ok?

01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:21.768
I feel horrible.

01:02:21.792 --> 01:02:25.125
Oh, no. It's my fault.
I got in the way.

01:02:25.834 --> 01:02:26.834
Ow.

01:02:27.959 --> 01:02:29.559
Getting punched in the
face really hurts.

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:33.226
It's the first time anyone,
much less a girl...

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.643
- Woman!
- A woman.

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:36.518
A woman, took a punch for me.

01:02:36.542 --> 01:02:37.542
I think that's...

01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:40.226
I think the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:43.792
I think that's the nicest thing
I've ever done for anyone.

01:02:55.125 --> 01:02:56.208
You know, I...

01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:58.267
I'm thinking about something

01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:01.792
I haven't done with
anyone in years.

01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:03.667
Yeah?

01:03:04.417 --> 01:03:07.375
I'm totally up for anything.

01:03:08.542 --> 01:03:09.542
Really?

01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:14.625
You wanna cook together?

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:20.000
So, let's make this fun, huh?

01:03:21.083 --> 01:03:22.834
Go pick like,

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:24.893
ten random ingredients.

01:03:24.917 --> 01:03:26.542
Really? Is that gonna be good?

01:03:27.083 --> 01:03:28.083
Ok.

01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:34.834
- Oh!
- What do you think?

01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:43.417
How about that.

01:03:44.709 --> 01:03:46.041
You're going easy on me.

01:03:59.709 --> 01:04:02.041
You are a very smart man.

01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:08.125
Nice.

01:04:10.041 --> 01:04:11.041
That's good.

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.917
Oh, so spicy!

01:04:23.542 --> 01:04:25.101
- Control the bowl.
- Stop!

01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:26.625
I got it, I got it.

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.917
This is getting a little weird.

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:01.601
But I like it.

01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:16.917
I can't dance or cook.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.166
What the heck?

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:08.166
Corn Flakes never
looked so good.

01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:31.208
- ¿Sí?
- They're cooking.

01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:33.417
- ¡No!
- Sí.

01:06:35.875 --> 01:06:37.417
He might be the one!

01:06:38.917 --> 01:06:39.917
¡Salud!

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:50.041
It looks too good to eat.

01:06:51.917 --> 01:06:53.208
And you...

01:06:54.125 --> 01:06:55.750
look too good to be true.

01:07:03.959 --> 01:07:04.959
Careful.

01:07:36.917 --> 01:07:39.810
No, no, it's a great idea.
The mix is the...

01:07:39.834 --> 01:07:41.935
the dessert with the entree,

01:07:41.959 --> 01:07:44.291
and that's why I think
it's a true winner.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.309
A churro stuffed with a
beefy beanie burrito?

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:48.434
Come on, Brian.

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:50.559
I sent you out for
a new product.

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:52.393
No, no, no, no, no.
It's a good idea.

01:07:52.417 --> 01:07:55.893
It's a Humami thing. It's
the salts with the sweets.

01:07:55.917 --> 01:07:56.917
Yummy.

01:07:57.583 --> 01:07:58.851
Yeah. Oh, thanks, dude.

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:00.768
All right. You guys aren't
giving me anything.

01:08:00.792 --> 01:08:02.893
Don't tell me I have
to rely on Joel.

01:08:02.917 --> 01:08:05.976
Oh, speaking of which, did
the chile sample come in?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
No.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.976
You know a way to
turn things around?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.184
A new marketing campaign.

01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:12.309
Yeah. Good idea, genius.

01:08:12.333 --> 01:08:14.142
We just ran a bunch
of new spots.

01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:16.125
And we saw no bump in sales.

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:17.975
What about running old spots?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.125
Retro is in,

01:08:20.166 --> 01:08:21.446
and most importantly,
it's cheap.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.142
You know what? I like that.
I like it a lot.

01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:37.625
So good!

01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:52.750
Hello? You've reached Joel.
Gotcha!

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:31.959
It's my assistant.

01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:35.582
Oh. Well, maybe it's important.

01:09:37.082 --> 01:09:38.625
Do you have any open cases?

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.082
Open cases?

01:09:40.291 --> 01:09:41.917
You watch a lot of TV.

01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:47.125
I have a PhD in TV law,
yes, thank you very much.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.434
Today is the big day, huh?

01:09:51.457 --> 01:09:53.917
You get to finally
get your car back.

01:09:55.125 --> 01:09:57.208
I hope he caught a lot of fish.

01:09:57.542 --> 01:10:00.041
And I'm making my
signature dish.

01:10:02.542 --> 01:10:05.101
I thought you'd be a little
more enthused about it.

01:10:05.125 --> 01:10:06.393
I am, for you.

01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:08.893
And I've been waiting
forever for this dish.

01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:10.583
Yeah, you have.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.291
Well...

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.726
you know, just because
you get your car back,

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:18.417
doesn't mean you have to leave.

01:10:19.166 --> 01:10:20.417
Who says I'm leaving?

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:21.917
Who says you're not?

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.500
I do.

01:10:40.917 --> 01:10:41.917
Dude!

01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:47.291
Hey.

01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:51.291
What are you doing here?

01:10:52.083 --> 01:10:53.917
Thanks for returning my calls!

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:56.875
- Joel?
- Javiera.

01:11:01.166 --> 01:11:02.333
This is...

01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:06.125
Oh, I'm Stacey. Joel's sister.

01:11:07.625 --> 01:11:09.500
And this is Aaron, a colleague.

01:11:09.792 --> 01:11:12.125
It's very nice to meet
you, both of you.

01:11:12.375 --> 01:11:14.333
I'm Javiera, Joel's...

01:11:15.333 --> 01:11:16.333
I mean...

01:11:17.083 --> 01:11:19.834
So? What brings you two here?

01:11:20.959 --> 01:11:22.125
Business.

01:11:22.834 --> 01:11:25.000
Business? In Villanueva?

01:11:25.542 --> 01:11:26.810
There's not much here.

01:11:26.834 --> 01:11:30.041
Oh, I don't know, I wouldn't
be so sure about that.

01:11:31.333 --> 01:11:34.959
Well, I'm so happy to meet you.
Today is a good day, too.

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:37.208
I'm making my specialty.

01:11:38.208 --> 01:11:39.351
Oh!

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:42.083
I had a feeling today was
gonna be a good day.

01:11:42.834 --> 01:11:45.226
Excuse me. I have to
return to the kitchen.

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:46.709
Of course, go!

01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:50.709
I need to talk to you.

01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:52.542
Alone.

01:11:53.834 --> 01:11:56.226
You had a very specific task.

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:59.142
And instead, I find you here
rebounding with this woman?

01:11:59.166 --> 01:12:01.000
It is not a rebound!

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:06.875
Oh, I take it that's
Javiera's daughter.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.709
So, this is what
you've been up to.

01:12:11.041 --> 01:12:12.709
- Playing house?
- Listen.

01:12:14.166 --> 01:12:16.017
She doesn't know who I am.

01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:17.875
She knows that I'm a lawyer,

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:19.685
but she doesn't know the rest.

01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:20.893
Please...

01:12:20.917 --> 01:12:23.750
Please let me tell her.
Give me that, at least.

01:12:24.917 --> 01:12:25.917
All right.

01:12:26.959 --> 01:12:30.601
But I advise you to come
back to reality and quickly.

01:12:30.625 --> 01:12:32.250
Before someone gets hurt.

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:35.750
Like that adorable
little girl over there.

01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:40.017
So, his sister is in town
doing business here?

01:12:40.041 --> 01:12:41.184
Maybe she's working in Santa Fe,

01:12:41.208 --> 01:12:43.226
I don't know, she
didn't really say.

01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:45.226
Maybe he's thinking
about moving here?

01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:48.518
- And she came to check you out.
- Stop it with the jinxing! Mamá!

01:12:48.542 --> 01:12:49.542
Right.

01:12:53.208 --> 01:12:56.226
It's that game! He's
been distracted all day.

01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:58.542
I'm gonna start charging
you for this, ok?

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:03.166
It's ok, you can keep the TV on.
I am having a great day.

01:13:03.959 --> 01:13:05.959
Oh, a woman in love.

01:13:06.291 --> 01:13:07.959
That's all it took? Damn!

01:13:09.458 --> 01:13:12.142
- So good!
- I'm glad you like it.

01:13:12.166 --> 01:13:15.000
So, my daughter tells me that
you're doing business here.

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:17.726
My company is looking to
expand into the area.

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:19.935
Maybe we'll get to
see you more often.

01:13:19.959 --> 01:13:22.434
We've gotten quite
used to Galileo.

01:13:22.458 --> 01:13:23.625
Galileo?

01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:25.351
Yeah, sorry.

01:13:25.375 --> 01:13:27.166
That's the town's nickname
for your brother.

01:13:28.458 --> 01:13:30.834
He thinks that the world
revolves around him, doesn't he?

01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:35.417
I'm really starting
to love this town.

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:37.559
So, tell me more about

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:39.267
this signature dish
of your daughter's.

01:13:39.291 --> 01:13:40.434
What's it called?

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:43.834
It's called, "Amanecer
chile verde de Javiera."

01:13:44.208 --> 01:13:46.834
Javiera's green chile sunrise.

01:13:47.959 --> 01:13:51.375
- ¡Órale! ¿Hablas español?
- Un poco.

01:13:51.959 --> 01:13:53.667
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

01:13:56.333 --> 01:13:57.625
How about that for marketing?

01:13:59.208 --> 01:14:00.834
Why aren't you just
sitting there?

01:14:01.959 --> 01:14:03.834
Why do you ask so
many questions?

01:14:04.333 --> 01:14:06.375
And why are you never in school?

01:14:07.125 --> 01:14:08.976
Well, my classroom got flooded

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.166
and mom says that the whole
entire town needs new ducks.

01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:15.667
I think you mean aqueducts.

01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:17.458
Yeah, that's what I said.

01:14:19.125 --> 01:14:21.291
Mom said you got your car back.

01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:23.333
Does that mean
you're gonna leave?

01:14:25.834 --> 01:14:27.083
I promise you something.

01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:31.166
I won't leave here unless
I'm no longer wanted.

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:32.875
But you're wanted.

01:14:33.333 --> 01:14:34.333
Thanks, kiddo.

01:14:35.041 --> 01:14:36.542
Wait, where are you going?

01:14:37.417 --> 01:14:39.333
To find out if I'm wanted.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.250
It's amazing!

01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:48.166
Perfect.

01:15:43.208 --> 01:15:44.250
Oh, come on!

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.500
It's ok.

01:15:52.917 --> 01:15:55.434
Tortilla Hut started with
the love and determination

01:15:55.458 --> 01:15:56.959
of one man...

01:15:58.458 --> 01:16:00.498
who respected nature and
whose motto was simplicity.

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:05.476
Where are you going?
You can't go in there.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.434
She's in the middle of service
and she will kill you.

01:16:08.458 --> 01:16:11.059
And to celebrate Tortilla
Hut's anniversary...

01:16:11.083 --> 01:16:12.434
- Our famous taco combo...
- Hey!

01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:14.417
- Isn't that Joel?
- Is available for only $0.49.

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:17.434
Why are grandpa's
tacos so good, Joel?

01:16:17.458 --> 01:16:18.458
Family and love.

01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:20.985
That makes everything
taste better.

01:16:21.291 --> 01:16:22.559
Tortilla Hut.

01:16:22.583 --> 01:16:24.063
Where everything is
bigger and better.

01:16:34.291 --> 01:16:36.333
Hey, what's going on?
Darling, what's going on?

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.375
He's not who he says he is.

01:16:39.667 --> 01:16:41.643
- You're not Joel?
- No, I'm still Joel.

01:16:41.667 --> 01:16:44.625
I'm just not the man your
mother thought I was.

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:47.101
That's what you
said about daddy.

01:16:47.125 --> 01:16:49.142
Please, give me a
chance to explain.

01:16:49.166 --> 01:16:50.166
For what?

01:16:50.875 --> 01:16:52.667
So you can lie to me some more?

01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:56.851
- What do you want from me?
- Hey, no! Hey, stop.

01:16:56.875 --> 01:16:59.166
Joel, what are you doing?

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:04.875
My dish.

01:17:06.792 --> 01:17:10.393
- You wanna steal my dish?
- No, we are not thieves.

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:13.208
We have every intention
of compensating you.

01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:15.500
You wanna rip me off, huh?

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.834
Where does your food come from?

01:17:21.166 --> 01:17:23.041
Tortilla Hut, of course.

01:17:23.375 --> 01:17:25.375
You know where my
food comes from?

01:17:27.166 --> 01:17:28.166
Them.

01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:31.583
The lamb from my albóndigas
come from Mr. Chaves.

01:17:32.333 --> 01:17:34.041
Oh, and then Mrs. Garcia.

01:17:34.333 --> 01:17:36.375
Her smoked chipotle cheddar.

01:17:38.375 --> 01:17:40.667
Her goats pasture on our hills.

01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:42.810
And she never gives
them hormones!

01:17:42.834 --> 01:17:43.851
You know why?

01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:46.375
Because she respects
the animals!

01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:49.875
And we can feel it, see it...

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.625
- taste it.
- That's right, Javiera.

01:17:53.959 --> 01:17:56.559
And what about the
most important part?

01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:58.458
Your family's chiles.

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:00.542
That's right.

01:18:01.875 --> 01:18:06.559
So you and your industrial
food lady with antibiotics,

01:18:06.583 --> 01:18:08.518
binders and emulsifiers,

01:18:08.542 --> 01:18:11.351
are gonna need a hell
of a lot of inspiration

01:18:11.375 --> 01:18:12.917
to duplicate what we have here.

01:18:14.458 --> 01:18:15.559
Well...

01:18:15.583 --> 01:18:18.458
we have all the
inspiration we need.

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:20.059
And we have a team
of food scientists

01:18:20.083 --> 01:18:22.458
who can duplicate your chile.

01:18:22.875 --> 01:18:24.250
That can't be real.

01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:28.875
Or legal.

01:18:29.917 --> 01:18:30.726
They're gonna compensate
you, Javiera.

01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:32.583
I'm gonna see to that.

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.059
Compensated?

01:18:34.083 --> 01:18:35.500
Ay, ¡qué idiota eres!

01:18:35.917 --> 01:18:38.583
You clearly don't know me.

01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:42.917
And I obviously never knew you.

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.250
Sophia!

01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:48.500
Javiera, please. I didn't
know how to tell you.

01:18:56.083 --> 01:18:58.976
- Was this all a joke to you?
- No, it was real.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.559
It was very real.

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:02.458
You don't even know
what that means.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.458
This is real to me.

01:19:08.583 --> 01:19:09.583
Family.

01:19:13.625 --> 01:19:16.792
And I want no part of
you or your family.

01:21:35.917 --> 01:21:36.959
Joel?

01:21:38.792 --> 01:21:40.184
Lauren!

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:42.142
- Wow, it's good to see you.
- Yeah, good to see you.

01:21:42.166 --> 01:21:43.458
Um...

01:21:44.417 --> 01:21:46.142
So, how long have you been back?

01:21:46.166 --> 01:21:48.500
Oh, a while now.

01:21:49.959 --> 01:21:51.726
I meant to reach out.

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:54.291
- No, Joel. I don't...
- To tell you I'm sorry.

01:21:54.959 --> 01:21:56.125
You deserve better.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:58.291
Thanks.

01:21:59.375 --> 01:22:01.750
That's... thanks.
That means a lot.

01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:05.333
- Hey, I heard you got promoted.
- Yeah, I did.

01:22:05.625 --> 01:22:07.875
And I got engaged. Yeah.

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:09.810
- Wow!
- I know!

01:22:09.834 --> 01:22:11.851
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, crazy, right?

01:22:11.875 --> 01:22:14.166
I mean, I know it's
super fast, but...

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.709
Hey, when you know, you know.

01:22:17.208 --> 01:22:18.208
You know?

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:22.667
- Hey, I made you laugh!
- That's more of a chuckle.

01:22:23.458 --> 01:22:24.476
But...

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.375
You always knew what
you wanted, Lauren.

01:22:27.875 --> 01:22:29.500
I wish I was so lucky.

01:22:30.291 --> 01:22:32.166
Maybe you're luckier
than you think, Joel.

01:22:33.792 --> 01:22:35.667
- Take care of yourself.
- You too.

01:22:40.875 --> 01:22:44.226
And I am pleased to report
that we're well on our way

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:46.375
to achieving our
quarterly objective,

01:22:46.667 --> 01:22:49.834
bringing sophisticated flavors
to mainstream America.

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:54.375
So now, I'd like to introduce
to you our new VP, Aaron Weston

01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:58.017
who is going to present to
you our new product report.

01:22:58.041 --> 01:22:59.041
Aaron?

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:01.041
Thank you, Stacey. Gentlemen.

01:23:01.875 --> 01:23:02.851
We have worked around the clock

01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:04.976
to duplicate the
Southwest experience

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.542
for our core consumers.

01:23:07.959 --> 01:23:10.226
Our team combed every
corner of the Southwest

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:12.750
to find its most authentic
regional dishes.

01:23:13.875 --> 01:23:15.643
And it doesn't get
more authentic

01:23:15.667 --> 01:23:18.000
than the smoky New
Mexican green chile.

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.309
Using cutting-edge food science

01:23:21.333 --> 01:23:23.476
Tortilla Hut is bringing
this exotic flavor

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.375
from our family to yours.

01:23:26.542 --> 01:23:28.351
Now, what we have come up with

01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:29.917
is testing through the roof.

01:23:30.542 --> 01:23:31.542
I give you...

01:23:32.917 --> 01:23:34.208
the Sopa Bowl salad.

01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:38.250
So, what we have done is

01:23:39.583 --> 01:23:41.893
recreate our favorite
Southwestern dish,

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:44.768
taking what works while
keeping cost low.

01:23:44.792 --> 01:23:47.059
Right. Instead of pricy lamb,
we're using ground beef.

01:23:47.083 --> 01:23:48.851
Instead of designer cheese,

01:23:48.875 --> 01:23:51.935
our version is processed,
but gooeylishious,

01:23:51.959 --> 01:23:53.709
as one focus group member said.

01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:04.250
You want people to eat that?

01:24:04.792 --> 01:24:07.792
No. We want them to devour it.

01:24:08.792 --> 01:24:10.291
Also testing through the roof,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.625
our chili sauce packets.

01:24:13.583 --> 01:24:14.768
Pass those down.

01:24:14.792 --> 01:24:16.893
We're thinking that
once these catch on,

01:24:16.917 --> 01:24:19.000
we'll just slide in
a little upcharge.

01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:32.500
You'll never be able to
duplicate Villanueva.

01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:35.834
And I'm glad to see it.

01:24:37.792 --> 01:24:38.792
Joel!

01:24:40.834 --> 01:24:42.935
And you'll never
duplicate Tortilla Hut

01:24:42.959 --> 01:24:43.935
and what it means to you.

01:24:43.959 --> 01:24:45.893
I don't wanna
duplicate anything.

01:24:45.917 --> 01:24:47.125
I want something real.

01:24:47.792 --> 01:24:49.041
I quit.

01:25:46.834 --> 01:25:47.834
Baby?

01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:54.583
People have been asking
about your sunrise dish.

01:25:55.875 --> 01:25:57.917
You know it's off
the menu, mamá.

01:26:01.041 --> 01:26:02.834
It's gonna be ok, ok?

01:26:03.875 --> 01:26:04.875
You'll see.

01:26:07.041 --> 01:26:08.041
Thank you.

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:14.250
I'll show them. I'll
bring Joel back.

01:26:15.875 --> 01:26:16.917
Hola, mi chiquita.

01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:20.893
Hola, abuelita.

01:26:20.917 --> 01:26:22.875
¿Qué haces? ¿Estudiando el mapa?

01:26:23.542 --> 01:26:25.583
Es un mapa del tesoro.

01:26:26.125 --> 01:26:27.583
A treasure map?

01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:30.208
You are my treasure.

01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:31.959
Tú eres mi tesoro.

01:27:05.125 --> 01:27:06.125
What are you doing?

01:27:07.792 --> 01:27:08.792
Oh, you...

01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:10.976
Nice, you...

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.291
You're getting me
my own flowers?

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.500
Hey.

01:27:16.458 --> 01:27:17.738
Never promised you
a rose garden.

01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:24.417
It's a song, it's from the 60's.
The 70's I think.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.792
Why are you here?

01:27:27.917 --> 01:27:28.917
Isn't it obvious?

01:27:30.583 --> 01:27:33.667
I came here, I
biked 900 miles...

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:35.750
for you.

01:27:38.208 --> 01:27:40.458
I love you, Javiera.

01:27:41.166 --> 01:27:43.101
You're not the first
man to tell me that.

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:46.125
Maybe I'm the first man
to ever come back.

01:27:47.125 --> 01:27:48.667
First man to apologize.

01:27:49.959 --> 01:27:52.291
What I did was
wrong and selfish.

01:27:52.542 --> 01:27:53.709
And I know now.

01:27:55.125 --> 01:27:57.768
What I want at the center of
my universe isn't myself,

01:27:57.792 --> 01:27:58.792
but you.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.458
You and Sophia.

01:28:06.125 --> 01:28:08.333
What do you plan
to do in this...

01:28:08.625 --> 01:28:10.041
small dusty town?

01:28:10.333 --> 01:28:12.184
I'm gonna open up a law office.

01:28:12.208 --> 01:28:16.709
I Googled, there is no
lawyer for 35 miles.

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:19.750
You? You Googled.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.500
I Googled.

01:28:26.375 --> 01:28:27.375
Where's Sophia?

01:28:28.375 --> 01:28:29.875
Mamá, have you seen Sophia?

01:28:30.083 --> 01:28:32.709
Sí, sí. She was playing
with her treasure map.

01:28:36.166 --> 01:28:38.166
Come back here,
you little thief!

01:28:39.583 --> 01:28:40.709
Sophia!

01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:42.810
Come back, you thief!

01:28:42.834 --> 01:28:44.226
My granddaughter is not a thief!

01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:45.351
Stop!

01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:46.750
She's a very good girl.

01:28:52.208 --> 01:28:53.226
Sophia!

01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:56.250
Sophia!

01:29:12.875 --> 01:29:14.417
Sophia, please, stop the truck.

01:29:16.875 --> 01:29:19.059
No, no, no, no, no. God!

01:29:26.458 --> 01:29:27.750
Chiquita!

01:30:16.333 --> 01:30:18.166
Help! Somebody help!

01:30:19.917 --> 01:30:21.291
Somebody help!

01:30:25.208 --> 01:30:26.208
Sophia!

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.166
Help! Somebody help!

01:30:31.291 --> 01:30:32.667
Can anyone hear me?

01:30:33.333 --> 01:30:34.333
Help!

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.667
Help!

01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:41.142
Somebody help!

01:30:41.166 --> 01:30:42.935
Sophia! I'm coming!

01:30:42.959 --> 01:30:45.142
Galileo, hurry!

01:30:45.166 --> 01:30:46.291
Help!

01:30:46.625 --> 01:30:47.834
My backpack!

01:30:48.792 --> 01:30:50.041
Swim towards the rocks!

01:30:51.166 --> 01:30:52.166
Sophia!

01:30:52.375 --> 01:30:53.976
Climb over to the rock.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Hold on!

01:30:57.208 --> 01:30:58.309
Hold on.

01:30:58.333 --> 01:31:01.375
Let go on three, ready?
One, two, three.

01:31:02.542 --> 01:31:03.667
Sophia!

01:31:05.333 --> 01:31:06.476
No, no, it's ok.

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.976
It's ok, just hold
on to Joel, baby.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.667
Oh my God!

01:31:14.583 --> 01:31:15.875
Ay, mi bebé.

01:31:16.375 --> 01:31:17.417
Mamita, it's ok.

01:31:21.333 --> 01:31:24.643
I love you, mommy is right here
Mommy is right here, baby.

01:31:24.667 --> 01:31:26.375
Mommy.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
My girl!

01:31:28.417 --> 01:31:30.208
My crazy little girl!

01:31:30.834 --> 01:31:33.333
¿Estás loquita? What
were you thinking?

01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:36.375
I wanted Joel back.

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:41.875
Can we keep him? Please?

01:31:42.166 --> 01:31:44.166
- He's not a dog, mamita.
- Please?

01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:46.083
Well...

01:31:47.041 --> 01:31:48.041
Thank you.

01:31:49.166 --> 01:31:51.559
Thank you for saving
my little girl's life.

01:31:51.583 --> 01:31:52.583
No.

01:31:53.792 --> 01:31:55.291
Thank you for saving mine.

01:32:01.792 --> 01:32:03.184
What are you looking at?

01:32:03.208 --> 01:32:04.542
Let's get out of here.

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:28.959
We have an order for three
more chili smoothies.

01:32:29.458 --> 01:32:31.643
Already? I haven't even
finished the last order yet.

01:32:31.667 --> 01:32:32.851
Hey!

01:32:32.875 --> 01:32:34.726
It was your idea to
integrate yourself

01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:36.291
into the family business.

01:32:37.667 --> 01:32:39.500
Come on, daddy! I'm not
getting any younger.

01:32:41.458 --> 01:32:42.893
I almost forgot,

01:32:42.917 --> 01:32:45.059
I've got to catch the DA before
he goes to his fishing lunch.

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:46.393
You're working on a Saturday?

01:32:46.417 --> 01:32:48.810
Hey, you knew I was a
lawyer when you married me.

01:32:48.834 --> 01:32:49.976
Besides, somebody's gotta fight

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.959
for those bike lanes
on Main Street.

01:32:52.291 --> 01:32:55.458
All right, all right. I'll
finish the smoothies.

01:32:56.083 --> 01:32:58.393
Hey! Hey, take it easy.

01:32:58.417 --> 01:32:59.750
I'm fine.

01:33:00.625 --> 01:33:02.267
What's she feeding you, anyway?

01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:03.333
Plenty of love.
