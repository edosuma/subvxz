WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:03.760
OK, Eric, born April 28th.

00:03.760 --> 00:08.160
That means 
 you're exactly 5,140 days,

00:08.160 --> 00:11.760
17 hours, 15 minutes, 
 and 37 seconds old.

00:11.760 --> 00:15.480
So what have you been 
 doing all this time?

00:15.480 --> 00:18.080
Waiting for Kiki.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.400
- Where did she go? 
 - Must be nature calling.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.560
- What the-- 
 - Hey, it's a flasher.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.800
Gotcha.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.400
Ew, gross! 
 My eyes are all red.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.320
I look 5,000 years old, 
 not 5,000 days.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.080
[Kiki] What you see is 
 what you get, old man.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.680
It's like a ghost becoming real.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.080
- When's your birthday, Kiki? 
 - Just get to the story.

00:43.080 --> 00:47.320
- Come on. 
 - OK, give me the pictures.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.400
Sometimes a camera sees 
 more than the naked eye.

00:53.400 --> 00:57.000
Some indian tribes hated 
 to have their pictures taken

00:57.000 --> 01:00.800
because they thought the camera 
 captures your soul...

01:00.800 --> 01:03.040
and maybe they were right.

01:04.120 --> 01:08.120
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:08.120 --> 01:11.680
I call this story...

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:21.680 --> 01:25.560
[Kiki] The AD in the Travel Magazine 
 said, "It's the perfect hotel

01:25.560 --> 01:29.680
"to spend a relaxing summer vacation 
 on a Crystal-Clear Lake.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.280
Join us for a visit 
 you'll never forget."

01:33.280 --> 01:34.960
Danielle and her parents

01:34.960 --> 01:38.120
thought the place sounded 
 too good to be true,

01:38.120 --> 01:41.600
but the AD was right-- 
 This was going to be a vacation

01:41.600 --> 01:43.240
they were never, 
 ever goinig to forget.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.600
- What a charming place. 
 - Looks boring.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.840
We should have gone to the ocean.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.360
Aw, what's the matter?

01:50.360 --> 01:54.600
You getting too old to have fun 
 with us all of a sudden?

01:54.600 --> 01:56.960
- No. 
 - All right.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.480
Then let's do it. 
 All right!

02:08.360 --> 02:11.200
- It's locked. 
 - Well, check over the door.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.000
Maybe there's a key.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.280
Ouch!

02:22.240 --> 02:24.360
Well, hello.

02:27.240 --> 02:27.990
Hi.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.040
You must be the Solomons.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.800
I'm Peter Kirlan III. 
 It's wonderful to have you here.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.480
Thanks.

02:38.480 --> 02:42.480
- Mrs. Solomon. 
 - Very nice to meet you, Peter.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.720
Are you parents 
 the innkeppers here?

02:44.720 --> 02:48.320
And this must be your lovely 
 daughter... Danielle.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.720
Uh... Yeah. Danny.

02:50.720 --> 02:55.080
Let me show you your rooms. 
 I think you'll find them very cozy.

03:05.960 --> 03:09.080
- [Mrs. Solomon] This is beautiful. 
 - Thank you.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.280
Gross.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.960
You're in luck.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.440
We have no other guests this week.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.760
You have the place to yourselves.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.680
This is your room, 
 Mr. and Mrs. Solomon.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.040
I hope it's to your liking.

03:33.040 --> 03:36.920
- [Mrs. Solomon] Wow! 
 - [Mr. Solomon] Yeah.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.240
What's with all the mirrors?

03:41.760 --> 03:44.480
My family's been 
 collecting them for years.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.240
It's kind of a tradition.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.440
They sure do like 
 to look at themselves.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.960
I kind of like them.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.360
- [crackling] 
 - Ouch!

03:57.360 --> 04:01.320
Sorry about that. 
 The wiring is quite old.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.360
In the mirror?

04:03.360 --> 04:05.800
Let me show you 
 your room, Danielle.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.080
Don't call me Danielle. 
 I hate that.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.360
What do you think?

04:17.800 --> 04:21.240
- This is a closet, not a room. 
 - Danny, don't be rude.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.400
I think you'll be very happy here.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.520
- Are your parents around? 
 - I guess we should be checking in.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.600
Oh, they're not here. 
 Actually, they're off on a cruise.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.720
I'll check you in.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.760
- You're here all alone? 
 - Not anymore.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.240
- Strange little guy. 
 - Totally weird.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.720
Go for it.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.800
You've got quite 
 an arm there, Danielle.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.480
Thanks.

05:17.480 --> 05:20.080
Don't call me Danielle.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.640
Come on, Pete. 
 Get in the game.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.960
I'm not much of a sportsman.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.600
Come on. 
 Pick up a glove.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.160
All right. Here goes.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.520
Oops.

05:40.440 --> 05:44.320
Dad, I thought this was supposed 
 to be our vacation together.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.600
Forget this geek.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.480
Come on, sweetie. 
 Give him a break.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.400
He's all alone.

05:53.960 --> 05:57.640
Besides, it'll be fun having 
 somebody else to play ball with.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.760
Here you are.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.720
- Well, maybe not. 
 - OK. Smile, everybody!

06:07.720 --> 06:09.960
- No! 
 - Pete!

06:09.960 --> 06:12.360
You OK? 
 What's wrong?

06:12.360 --> 06:15.280
Nothing. 
 Nothing at all.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.600
Let me take 
 a picture of you all.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.480
- Go stand with your family. 
 - OK.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.760
[chuckling]

06:40.600 --> 06:43.640
[bouncing noise]

07:01.680 --> 07:03.320
Hello.

07:30.600 --> 07:35.120
Hello, Danielle. 
 I didn't mean to startle you.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.200
You didn't. 
 I mean, um...

07:38.200 --> 07:40.000
is this your ball?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.400
What do you think of my room?

07:43.400 --> 07:46.960
You live here all summer... 
 by yourself?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.160
Possibly longer.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.760
- No parents? 
 - I do what I want...

07:53.760 --> 07:55.800
when I want.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.680
It's like a dream come true.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.920
Cool. 
 What do you do for fun?

07:59.920 --> 08:02.240
What do you want to do?

08:05.160 --> 08:09.240
I always admire a girl 
 with great physical strength.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.760
Is this you?

08:19.200 --> 08:21.600
No, wait. It says 1920.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.120
It's my grandfather.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.040
He looked a lot like me.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.960
- What's this? 
 - It's an experiment.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.240
My grandfather 
 designed it years ago.

08:31.240 --> 08:35.039
It's a transference... 
 of energy fields.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.080
But you're killing your roses.

08:37.080 --> 08:40.960
The geraniums are doing very well. 
 It's natural selection...

08:40.960 --> 08:42.640
with a little help.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.360
Don't!

08:45.880 --> 08:48.880
- You'll ruin it! 
 - OK, OK! Sorry.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.800
What are you doing?

08:52.800 --> 08:56.000
- Nothing. Really. 
 - What?

08:56.000 --> 09:00.120
- Don't be such a dweeb. 
 - Well, it's just...

09:00.120 --> 09:04.480
Well, I think you're breaking out.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.840
Gross!

09:15.800 --> 09:18.120
- [crackling] 
 - Ouch!

09:49.120 --> 09:49.840
[beep]

10:37.760 --> 10:39.600
[high-frequency tone]

11:00.680 --> 11:02.480
[fast ticking]

11:12.480 --> 11:13.920
Ha ha ha ha!

11:31.000 --> 11:33.280
Ha ha ha ha!

11:40.880 --> 11:43.960
What was he doing, anyway? 
 Take a light shower?

11:43.960 --> 11:46.600
Yeah. And why didn't he 
 want his picture taken?

11:46.600 --> 11:48.840
Maybe he was afraid 
 of what they'd see.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.040
But what about the Cylinder? 
 There were mirrors in there.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.560
Exactly. Mirrors.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.560
Just like in the rest of the house.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.800
Strike three! 
 You're out.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.880
You lucked up with that curve ball.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.400
You're out. I'm up.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.240
I'll pitch.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.520
OK, slugger. 
 Try this one.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.010
Whoo!

12:19.040 --> 12:20.800
Ha ha ha!

12:20.800 --> 12:24.480
- Nice hit, Pete. 
 - Yeah!

12:26.160 --> 12:29.040
He got lucky. 
 I got to quit.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.960
I'm feeling a little woozy.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.960
- Must be the heat. 
 - But we just started.

12:33.960 --> 12:37.560
I'm sorry, hon, 
 but I really am beat.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.200
Go get the ball, OK?

12:43.320 --> 12:45.840
Wait. 
 I'll get it.

12:45.840 --> 12:50.000
- Don't worry about it. 
 - No! I said I'll get it.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.000
Let's go swimming.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.640
Honey, I'm too tired. 
 Your father will take you.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.320
He can barely play softball.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.880
He's not going to want to swim.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.720
Go easy on him, Danny. 
 It's his vacation, too.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.280
Great.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.400
Look at you. 
 You know, I think we're going

13:22.400 --> 13:25.320
to have to get some 
 medication for your skin.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.080
- [crackling] 
 - Ouch!

13:58.440 --> 14:00.720
[glass breaks]

14:09.360 --> 14:12.080
Dad, come here quick! 
 Dad!

14:12.080 --> 14:13.840
What? What's up?

14:13.840 --> 14:17.040
Look, there's something 
 really weird going on here.

14:17.040 --> 14:20.320
- It's just the old wiring. 
 - In a mirror?

14:20.320 --> 14:22.960
What happened here? 
 Get this cleaned up

14:22.960 --> 14:26.960
before somebody gets hurt. 
 I'm going to take a nap.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.760
[coughing]

14:48.920 --> 14:49.640
[snap]

14:51.640 --> 14:54.040
Peter? Is that you?

15:05.040 --> 15:10.080
Peter Kirlan III. 
 Born 1907.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.000
There's no date.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.680
He must still be alive.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.880
What's that?

15:28.880 --> 15:30.520
What are you doing?

15:30.520 --> 15:33.440
There's something really 
 weird going on here, Mom.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.320
You look terrible.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.040
No! 
 Don't look in the mirror.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.040
Oh, I know I look terrible.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.960
I guess the years are 
 just catching up with me.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.320
We've got to leave-- 
 right now!

15:47.320 --> 15:50.720
Danny, your imagination 
 is running away with you.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.320
But you've gotten old 
 in a couple of days!

15:53.320 --> 15:55.600
What are you doing?

15:55.600 --> 15:58.200
No! Don't put it back!

15:58.200 --> 16:01.600
- Danny, don't be strange. 
 - Can't we just go home?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.920
This country air is 
 getting me lightheaded.

16:03.920 --> 16:09.080
- Then let's get out of here. 
 - I think I'll take a nap, too.

16:11.960 --> 16:14.000
I'm as weak as a kitten.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.720
Peter! 
 Peter, where are you?

16:20.720 --> 16:22.560
I want to talk.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.280
Peter!

16:30.080 --> 16:31.520
Very weird.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.240
The little goon's got hidden cameras.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.200
What's that?

17:50.240 --> 17:54.200
The fresh air out here 
 really is wonderful.

17:54.200 --> 17:59.080
I just find it takes so much 
 out of you sometimes, you know?

17:59.080 --> 18:00.520
Mm-hmm.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.880
Um... excuse me.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.960
Is that a new guest?

18:05.240 --> 18:07.640
What do you mean?

18:10.040 --> 18:13.520
Some tea, Danielle?

18:13.520 --> 18:16.000
But you were...

18:31.120 --> 18:37.360
[Danny] 
 21 men, 15 women, 34 kids...

18:40.400 --> 18:45.600
- 10 dogs? 
 - So, you found our little plot.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.440
Who are you? 
 What are you doing to us?

18:49.440 --> 18:52.840
You were right. 
 It's all done with mirrors,

18:52.840 --> 18:56.080
which you have cleverly 
 managed to avoid.

18:57.080 --> 19:01.360
After tonight, you'll be 
 all alone... just like me.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.720
You can stay on in 
 the house if you'd like.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.040
We can be friends.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.120
What do you mean, 
 I'll be all alone?

19:08.120 --> 19:10.120
Your parents are 
 checking out tonight.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.520
- What? 
 - Yes. We've entered the final phase.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.760
- It won't be long now. 
 - You leave my parents alone.

19:16.760 --> 19:20.920
Stay with me, Danielle. 
 We can be young... forever.

19:20.920 --> 19:25.080
- You're crazy! 
 - No. I'm very, very smart.

19:25.080 --> 19:30.040
But if you won't join me, 
 I'll have to use you, too.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.040
Aah!

19:32.760 --> 19:34.480
It's too late!

19:34.480 --> 19:36.400
You don't have any time!

19:41.080 --> 19:43.600
Mom! Dad! 
 It's in the mirrors.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.200
- They're making you old. 
 - Not now, Danny.

19:46.200 --> 19:50.640
Get up! I can't come in, 
 or I'll get it, too.

19:50.640 --> 19:54.600
Be a love. 
 Get me a glass of water.

20:16.160 --> 20:19.760
- Get away! 
 - Why don't you look at yourself?

20:19.760 --> 20:21.560
You don't know 
 what you're doing.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.840
I know what you're doing.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.280
You're stealing other people's 
 souls so you can stay young.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.400
How old are you really? 
 80, 90?

20:28.400 --> 20:31.400
- Don't be foolish, Danielle. 
 - I'm offering you eternal youth.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.960
- You're a twisted old man. 
 - I'm a scientist.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.640
You're a monster.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.440
Please, Danielle. 
 Don't do anything.

20:37.440 --> 20:41.040
- You don't understand! 
 - Oh, I understand, all right.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.160
You're trying to take 
 my parents away from me.

20:49.800 --> 20:53.560
Well, you messed with 
 the wrong girl, Peter boy.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.920
Danielle, no!

20:54.920 --> 20:57.880
And don't call me Danielle.

20:59.000 --> 20:59.750
No!

21:15.760 --> 21:16.510
No!

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Mom! Dad! Wake up!

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
We got to get out of here.

21:22.600 --> 21:26.200
Feel like I've dropped 
 a million years.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.600
You all right, honey? 
 Where have you been?

21:28.600 --> 21:30.920
- I stopped him. 
 - You stopped who?

21:30.920 --> 21:33.160
Peter. 
 I was up in the...

21:34.360 --> 21:36.360
Never mind.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.600
Well, I feel great.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.560
What'll we do?

21:40.560 --> 21:43.680
- How about a trip? 
 - Hmm. Where to?

21:43.680 --> 21:46.280
Anywhere that is 
 a long way from here.

21:49.960 --> 21:50.680
Danny?

21:54.920 --> 21:56.600
Peter?

21:56.600 --> 21:58.960
Goodbye, Danny.

22:00.320 --> 22:04.520
I'm going out back now 
 to join my family.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.280
It's been far too long.

22:08.720 --> 22:12.600
Enjoy your youth while you can.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.800
Danny? Who was that?

22:20.800 --> 22:22.600
Nobody.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.720
I just found this out front. 
 Any idea who it is?

22:27.720 --> 22:31.800
No. 
 Just looks like some sad old man.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.920
[Kiki] Danny never told her parents 
 the true story about Peter.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.080
OK. Let's go.

22:44.080 --> 22:48.440
They were safe, and Peter wasn't 
 going to hurt anybody again.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.240
That's all that mattered.

22:50.240 --> 22:53.800
And she finally convinced 
 her parents to go to the ocean.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.360
So you see, sometimes 
 pictures do tell the truth...

22:58.360 --> 23:00.560
whether you like it or not.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.760
And I've got one shot left.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.320
Smile, everybody.
