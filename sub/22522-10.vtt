00:47.544 --> 00:49.603
(HEART BEATING)

00:49.813 --> 00:53.408
SAGAN: <i>There is one experience</i>
<i>that every human shares...</i>

00:53.616 --> 00:55.880
<i>... of every language and culture:</i>

00:56.086 --> 00:58.111
<i>The experience of birth.</i>

00:58.621 --> 01:02.250
<i>Our recollections of birth are</i>
<i>hazy at best.</i>

01:02.459 --> 01:06.828
<i>They have the feel and aura</i>
<i>not so much of memories...</i>

01:07.030 --> 01:11.228
<i>... as of mystical transfigurations.</i>

01:11.434 --> 01:15.370
<i>It would be astonishing if</i>
<i>this profound early experience...</i>

01:15.572 --> 01:18.166
<i>... did not influence</i>
<i>our myths and religions...</i>

01:18.375 --> 01:21.071
<i>... our philosophy and our science.</i>

01:21.277 --> 01:26.078
<i>The birth of a child evokes</i>
<i>the mystery of other origins...</i>

01:26.282 --> 01:28.773
<i>... the beginnings and ends</i>
<i>of worlds...</i>

01:29.052 --> 01:32.283
<i>... infinity and eternity.</i>

01:33.490 --> 01:38.427
How did the universe arise?

01:39.262 --> 01:42.356
What was around before that?

01:43.199 --> 01:45.827
Might there have been no beginning?

01:46.035 --> 01:49.766
<i>Could the universe be infinitely old?</i>

01:49.973 --> 01:53.500
<i>Are there boundaries to the cosmos?</i>

01:53.877 --> 01:57.142
<i>The current scientific story</i>
<i>of the origin of the universe...</i>

01:57.380 --> 02:01.749
<i>... begins with an explosion</i>
<i>which made space itself expand.</i>

02:01.951 --> 02:03.748
<i>About 15 billion years ago...</i>

02:03.953 --> 02:07.389
<i>... all the matter and energy that</i>
<i>make up the observable universe...</i>

02:07.590 --> 02:12.186
<i>... were concentrated into a space</i>
<i>smaller than the head of a pin.</i>

02:12.395 --> 02:17.128
<i>The cosmos blew apart in one</i>
<i>inconceivably colossal explosion:</i>

02:17.333 --> 02:18.561
<i>The big bang.</i>

02:18.835 --> 02:23.067
<i>The stuff of the universe, together</i>
<i>with the fabric of space itself...</i>

02:23.273 --> 02:26.936
<i>... began expanding in all directions</i>
<i>as they do today.</i>

02:27.143 --> 02:30.078
<i>We can visualize this process</i>
<i>with a three-dimensional grid...</i>

02:30.280 --> 02:33.875
<i>... attached to the expanding fabric</i>
<i>of space.</i>

02:35.485 --> 02:39.080
<i>The early cosmos was</i>
<i>everywhere white-hot.</i>

02:39.289 --> 02:42.520
<i>But as time passed,</i>
<i>the radiation expanded and cooled...</i>

02:42.725 --> 02:46.957
<i>... and in ordinarily visible light,</i>
<i>space became dark as it is today.</i>

02:47.730 --> 02:51.291
<i>But then little pockets of gas</i>
<i>began to grow.</i>

02:51.501 --> 02:54.265
<i>Tendrils of gossamer clouds formed...</i>

02:54.471 --> 02:58.737
<i>... colonies of great, lumbering,</i>
<i>slowly spinning things...</i>

02:58.942 --> 03:02.275
<i>... steadily brightening,</i>
<i>each a kind of beast...</i>

03:02.479 --> 03:05.915
<i>... composed of a hundred billion</i>
<i>shining points.</i>

03:09.552 --> 03:13.852
<i>The largest recognizable structures</i>
<i>in the universe had formed.</i>

03:14.057 --> 03:18.391
<i>We see them today. We ourselves</i>
<i>inhabit some lost corner of one.</i>

03:18.595 --> 03:20.995
<i>We call them the galaxies.</i>

03:21.197 --> 03:23.665
<i>We inhabit a universe of galaxies.</i>

03:23.867 --> 03:28.065
<i>There are unstructured blobs,</i>
<i>the irregular galaxies...</i>

03:28.271 --> 03:31.138
<i>... globular or elliptical galaxies...</i>

03:31.341 --> 03:35.641
<i>... and the graceful blue arms</i>
<i>of spiral galaxies.</i>

03:36.613 --> 03:38.513
<i>We've been investigating</i>
<i>the galaxies...</i>

03:38.715 --> 03:42.981
<i>... their origins, evolution and</i>
<i>motions for less than a century.</i>

03:43.186 --> 03:45.848
<i>These studies extend</i>
<i>our understanding...</i>

03:46.055 --> 03:49.115
<i>... to the farthest reaches</i>
<i>of the universe.</i>

03:51.194 --> 03:55.824
<i>Our ship of the imagination carries us</i>
<i>to that ultimate frontier.</i>

03:56.032 --> 03:59.627
<i>We view the cosmos</i>
<i>on the grandest of scales.</i>

03:59.836 --> 04:04.273
<i>The majesty of the galaxies</i>
<i>is revealed by science.</i>

04:05.074 --> 04:09.306
<i>There are many different ways in which</i>
<i>stars are arrayed into galaxies.</i>

04:12.882 --> 04:17.319
<i>When, by chance, the face of a spiral</i>
<i>galaxy is turned toward us...</i>

04:17.520 --> 04:22.457
<i>... we see the spiral arms,</i>
<i>made luminous by billions of stars.</i>

04:22.659 --> 04:27.221
<i>When, in other cases, the edge</i>
<i>of a galaxy is towards us...</i>

04:27.430 --> 04:29.660
<i>... we see the central lanes</i>
<i>of gas and dust...</i>

04:29.866 --> 04:32.164
<i>... from which the stars are forming.</i>

04:34.003 --> 04:37.769
<i>In barred spirals,</i>
<i>a river of star stuff...</i>

04:37.974 --> 04:40.204
<i>... extends through</i>
<i>the galactic center...</i>

04:40.410 --> 04:43.311
<i>... connecting opposite spiral arms.</i>

04:44.047 --> 04:48.984
<i>Elliptical galaxies come</i>
<i>in giant and dwarf sizes.</i>

04:51.654 --> 04:53.679
<i>There are many mysterious galaxies...</i>

04:53.890 --> 04:56.859
<i>... places where something has gone</i>
<i>terribly wrong...</i>

04:57.060 --> 04:59.221
<i>... where there are</i>
<i>explosions and collisions...</i>

04:59.429 --> 05:02.398
<i>... and streamers of gas and stars...</i>

05:02.599 --> 05:05.727
<i>... bridges between the galaxies.</i>

05:07.370 --> 05:10.601
<i>The galaxies look rigid, unmoving.</i>

05:10.807 --> 05:14.436
<i>But we see them only for</i>
<i>a single frame of the cosmic movie.</i>

05:14.644 --> 05:17.977
<i>Their parts are dissipating</i>
<i>and reforming...</i>

05:18.181 --> 05:21.150
<i>... on a time scale of</i>
<i>hundreds of millions of years.</i>

05:21.351 --> 05:25.447
<i>A galaxy is a fluid made</i>
<i>of billions of suns...</i>

05:25.655 --> 05:28.624
<i>... all bound together by gravity.</i>

05:29.459 --> 05:33.361
<i>These giant galactic forms exist</i>
<i>throughout the universe...</i>

05:33.563 --> 05:37.055
<i>... and may be a common source</i>
<i>of wonderment and instruction...</i>

05:37.266 --> 05:40.497
<i>... for billions of species</i>
<i>of intelligent life.</i>

05:44.273 --> 05:49.210
<i>Their evolution is governed everywhere</i>
<i>by the same laws of physics.</i>

05:53.249 --> 05:55.342
<i>We need a computer to illustrate...</i>

05:55.551 --> 05:57.917
<i>... the collective motion</i>
<i>of so many stars...</i>

05:58.121 --> 06:02.251
<i>... each under the gravitational</i>
<i>influence of all the others.</i>

06:06.095 --> 06:11.032
<i>A billion years is here compressed</i>
<i>into a few seconds.</i>

06:13.836 --> 06:18.773
<i>In some cases, spiral arms form</i>
<i>all by themselves.</i>

06:28.051 --> 06:29.348
<i>In other cases...</i>

06:29.552 --> 06:33.044
<i>... the close gravitational encounter</i>
<i>of two galaxies...</i>

06:33.256 --> 06:36.885
<i>... will draw out spiral arms.</i>

06:42.899 --> 06:46.096
<i>But when two nearby galaxies</i>
<i>collide...</i>

06:46.302 --> 06:48.998
<i>... like a bullet through</i>
<i>a swarm of bees...</i>

06:49.205 --> 06:51.139
<i>... the stars hardly collide at all.</i>

06:51.340 --> 06:56.243
<i>But the shapes of the galaxies</i>
<i>can be severely distorted.</i>

07:01.050 --> 07:05.646
<i>A direct collision of two galaxies can</i>
<i>last a hundred million years...</i>

07:05.888 --> 07:08.448
<i>... and spill the constituent stars...</i>

07:08.658 --> 07:12.219
<i>... careening through</i>
<i>intergalactic space.</i>

07:14.263 --> 07:18.757
<i>When a dense, compact galaxy runs</i>
<i>into a larger one face-on...</i>

07:18.968 --> 07:22.335
<i>... it can produce one of the loveliest</i>
<i>of the rare irregulars:</i>

07:22.538 --> 07:24.597
<i>A ring galaxy.</i>

07:33.249 --> 07:35.581
<i>Thousands of light-years across...</i>

07:35.785 --> 07:38.083
<i>... a ring galaxy is set...</i>

07:38.287 --> 07:41.882
<i>... against the velvet</i>
<i>of intergalactic space.</i>

07:45.862 --> 07:50.196
<i>It's a temporary configuration</i>
<i>of disrupted stars...</i>

07:50.399 --> 07:53.698
<i>... a splash in the cosmic pond.</i>

07:59.809 --> 08:02.710
<i>Galaxies sometimes blow themselves up.</i>

08:02.945 --> 08:06.847
<i>The quasars, probably billions</i>
<i>of light-years away...</i>

08:07.049 --> 08:10.644
<i>... may be the colossal explosions</i>
<i>of young galaxies.</i>

08:10.853 --> 08:12.184
<i>But we're not sure.</i>

08:12.388 --> 08:16.017
<i>Quasars are a mystery still.</i>

08:20.296 --> 08:24.665
<i>The galaxies reveal</i>
<i>a universal order, beauty...</i>

08:24.867 --> 08:29.395
<i>... but also violence on a scale</i>
<i>never before imagined.</i>

08:29.672 --> 08:33.540
<i>The universe seems neither</i>
<i>benign nor hostile...</i>

08:33.743 --> 08:38.680
<i>... merely indifferent to the concerns</i>
<i>of such creatures as we.</i>

08:42.285 --> 08:46.187
<i>Quasars may be monster versions</i>
<i>of rapidly rotating pulsars...</i>

08:46.389 --> 08:49.256
<i>... or due to multiple collisions</i>
<i>of millions of stars...</i>

08:49.458 --> 08:52.256
<i>... densely packed</i>
<i>in the galactic core...</i>

08:52.461 --> 08:57.398
<i>... or a chain reaction of supernova</i>
<i>explosions in such a core.</i>

08:59.869 --> 09:03.532
<i>Some astronomers think a quasar is</i>
<i>caused by millions of stars...</i>

09:03.773 --> 09:08.039
<i>... falling into an immense black hole</i>
<i>in the core of a galaxy.</i>

09:08.277 --> 09:10.040
<i>Something like a black hole...</i>

09:10.279 --> 09:14.773
<i>... something very massive,</i>
<i>very dense and very small...</i>

09:14.984 --> 09:17.976
<i>... is ticking and purring away...</i>

09:18.187 --> 09:21.350
<i>... in the cores of nearby galaxies.</i>

09:30.433 --> 09:33.891
<i>Even a well-behaved galaxy</i>
<i>like the Milky Way...</i>

09:34.103 --> 09:37.834
<i>... has its stirrings and its dances.</i>

09:39.375 --> 09:43.402
<i>The stars of the Milky Way move</i>
<i>with systematic grace.</i>

09:43.613 --> 09:46.912
<i>The sun takes 250 million years...</i>

09:47.149 --> 09:49.674
<i>... to go once around the core.</i>

09:50.486 --> 09:52.511
<i>The outer provinces of the galaxy...</i>

09:52.722 --> 09:55.486
<i>... revolve more slowly</i>
<i>than the inner regions.</i>

09:55.691 --> 09:59.855
<i>As a result, gas and dust</i>
<i>pile up in spiral patterns.</i>

10:00.062 --> 10:02.724
<i>These places of greater density</i>
<i>are where...</i>

10:02.932 --> 10:04.991
<i>... young, hot, bright stars form...</i>

10:05.268 --> 10:07.896
<i>... the stars which outline</i>
<i>the spiral arms.</i>

10:08.104 --> 10:11.699
<i>These hot stars shine for only</i>
<i>10 million years or so...</i>

10:11.908 --> 10:14.741
<i>... and then blow up.</i>

10:16.312 --> 10:19.611
<i>But as the stars which outline</i>
<i>a spiral arm burn out...</i>

10:19.849 --> 10:22.909
<i>... new, young stars are formed</i>
<i>from the debris just behind them...</i>

10:23.119 --> 10:26.145
<i>... and the spiral pattern persists.</i>

10:28.291 --> 10:30.259
<i>The sun, marked here with a circle...</i>

10:30.459 --> 10:33.257
<i>... has been in and out</i>
<i>of spiral arms often...</i>

10:33.462 --> 10:35.953
<i>... in the 20 times it has</i>
<i>gone around the Milky Way.</i>

10:36.165 --> 10:40.499
<i>In this epoch, we live</i>
<i>at the edge of a spiral arm.</i>

10:45.341 --> 10:49.209
<i>We've looked at internal galactic</i>
<i>motion on a small scale...</i>

10:49.412 --> 10:52.006
<i>... across a million light-years</i>
<i>or less.</i>

10:52.214 --> 10:54.876
<i>But the motion of the galaxies</i>
<i>themselves...</i>

10:55.084 --> 10:58.144
<i>... across billions of light-years</i>
<i>is different.</i>

10:58.354 --> 11:02.381
<i>That motion is a relic</i>
<i>of the big bang.</i>

11:03.326 --> 11:06.693
<i>The key to cosmology,</i>
<i>the study of the entire universe...</i>

11:06.896 --> 11:09.194
<i>... turns out to be</i>
<i>a commonplace of nature...</i>

11:09.398 --> 11:12.697
<i>... an experience of everyday life.</i>

11:17.306 --> 11:20.173
<i>Imagine a moving object</i>
<i>sending out waves.</i>

11:20.376 --> 11:22.276
<i>It could be light waves...</i>

11:22.511 --> 11:23.535
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

11:23.746 --> 11:27.443
<i>... it could be sound waves,</i>
<i>it could be any kind of wave.</i>

11:32.455 --> 11:34.582
<i>When that moving object passes us...</i>

11:34.790 --> 11:37.452
<i>... we sense a change in pitch.</i>

11:37.693 --> 11:41.060
<i>That's called the Doppler effect.</i>

11:44.400 --> 11:46.197
<i>If you're the engineer in the cab...</i>

11:46.402 --> 11:49.735
<i>... the pitch of the whistle</i>
<i>always sounds the same to you.</i>

11:49.972 --> 11:53.931
<i>That's because you're moving along</i>
<i>with the source of the sound.</i>

11:54.410 --> 11:57.470
<i>But if you're standing alongside</i>
<i>the track when the train passes...</i>

11:57.680 --> 12:00.581
<i>... you hear that familiar</i>
<i>shift in pitch:</i>

12:00.816 --> 12:02.681
<i>The Doppler shift.</i>

12:08.290 --> 12:10.758
<i>The reason this happens</i>
<i>is easy to understand...</i>

12:10.960 --> 12:13.656
<i>... once you visualize the waves.</i>

12:14.363 --> 12:17.491
<i>A stationary train sends out</i>
<i>sound waves in perfect circles...</i>

12:17.700 --> 12:19.998
<i>... like the ripples on a pond.</i>

12:21.871 --> 12:24.066
<i>Let's start the train again.</i>

12:28.544 --> 12:32.571
<i>Now, the waves spreading out ahead</i>
<i>of it get squashed together...</i>

12:32.782 --> 12:35.444
<i>... and those spreading out behind it</i>
<i>get stretched apart.</i>

12:35.684 --> 12:38.585
<i>The compressed waves have</i>
<i>a higher frequency or pitch...</i>

12:38.788 --> 12:40.756
<i>... than the stretched-out waves.</i>

12:42.291 --> 12:44.191
<i>The same thing is true</i>
<i>for light waves.</i>

12:44.393 --> 12:48.193
<i>Color is to light</i>
<i>precisely what pitch is to sound.</i>

12:48.798 --> 12:51.562
<i>Compressed light waves are made bluer.</i>
<i>They're blue-shifted.</i>

12:51.767 --> 12:55.533
<i>Stretched-out light waves are</i>
<i>made redder. They're red-shifted.</i>

12:58.240 --> 12:59.502
<i>At the speed of a train...</i>

12:59.708 --> 13:03.337
<i>... you can sense the change of pitch</i>
<i>for sound, but not for light.</i>

13:03.546 --> 13:07.482
<i>The train is traveling about</i>
<i>a million times too slow for that.</i>

13:12.421 --> 13:15.754
<i>It turns out that the Doppler effect</i>
<i>for light waves...</i>

13:15.991 --> 13:18.892
<i>... is the key to the cosmos.</i>

13:20.496 --> 13:23.158
<i>The evidence for this was</i>
<i>gathered unexpectedly...</i>

13:23.365 --> 13:28.234
<i>... by a former mule-team driver</i>
<i>who never went beyond the eighth grade.</i>

13:29.371 --> 13:31.236
<i>During the second decade</i>
<i>of this century...</i>

13:31.440 --> 13:34.932
<i>... the world's largest telescope was</i>
<i>being assembled on Mount Wilson...</i>

13:35.177 --> 13:39.511
<i>... overlooking what were then</i>
<i>the clear skies of Los Angeles.</i>

13:40.216 --> 13:43.652
<i>Large pieces of the telescope were</i>
<i>hauled to the mountaintop...</i>

13:43.853 --> 13:46.253
<i>... a job for mule teams.</i>

13:49.225 --> 13:52.683
<i>One of the drivers was</i>
<i>a young man named Milton Humason...</i>

13:52.895 --> 13:56.558
<i>... the ne'er-do-well son</i>
<i>of a California banker.</i>

13:56.799 --> 13:59.666
<i>But he was bright and naturally</i>
<i>curious about the equipment...</i>

13:59.869 --> 14:01.666
<i>... he had carted up Mount Wilson.</i>

14:01.871 --> 14:05.136
<i>And after the telescope was</i>
<i>completed in 1917...</i>

14:05.341 --> 14:09.402
<i>... he managed to stay on here</i>
<i>as janitor and electrician.</i>

14:10.479 --> 14:14.347
<i>One evening, so the story goes, the</i>
<i>observatory night assistant was ill.</i>

14:14.550 --> 14:17.178
<i>Humason was asked to fill in.</i>

14:24.293 --> 14:26.158
<i>Humason was a gambling man...</i>

14:26.362 --> 14:29.889
<i>... celebrated for his skill at poker</i>
<i>and at the pool table.</i>

14:30.099 --> 14:34.331
<i>But his touch with the telescope was</i>
<i>admired even more.</i>

14:34.603 --> 14:37.936
<i>He discovered he had a talent</i>
<i>for using astronomical instruments.</i>

14:38.174 --> 14:42.440
<i>He became the virtuoso</i>
<i>of the 100-inch telescope.</i>

14:43.779 --> 14:46.213
<i>In this instrument,</i>
<i>light from distant galaxies...</i>

14:46.415 --> 14:48.781
<i>... is focused on</i>
<i>a glass photographic plate...</i>

14:48.984 --> 14:53.011
<i>... by a great encased mirror</i>
<i>100 inches across.</i>

14:54.590 --> 14:58.492
<i>By the late 1920s, Humason was</i>
<i>making observations himself.</i>

14:58.694 --> 15:00.525
Mr. Nelson?

15:00.729 --> 15:03.323
NELSON:
I'm in the <i>coudé</i> room, sir.

15:08.337 --> 15:10.897
SAGAN: <i>Humason by now had</i>
<i>his own night assistant...</i>

15:11.140 --> 15:13.540
<i>... to help him with the observations.</i>

15:15.611 --> 15:18.546
HUMASON: Afternoon, Mr. Nelson.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Humason.

15:19.014 --> 15:20.379
We'll start at 6.

15:20.583 --> 15:23.484
I'll be making a spectrogram
at the Cassegrain focus.

15:23.686 --> 15:25.051
Yes, sir.

15:26.322 --> 15:29.348
SAGAN: <i>The telescope must be able</i>
<i>to point with high accuracy...</i>

15:29.558 --> 15:33.722
<i>... to a designated region of the sky,</i>
<i>and to keep on pointing there.</i>

15:35.264 --> 15:39.166
<i>A machine weighing about 75 tons,</i>
<i>as massive as a locomotive...</i>

15:39.368 --> 15:43.134
<i>... must move with a precision greater</i>
<i>than that of the finest pocket watch.</i>

15:47.643 --> 15:50.737
<i>Everything must be checked</i>
<i>thoroughly.</i>

15:55.618 --> 15:59.486
<i>The electrical power system</i>
<i>must work flawlessly.</i>

16:06.862 --> 16:10.525
<i>Hours before observations are</i>
<i>to begin, the dome is opened...</i>

16:10.733 --> 16:14.635
<i>... to allow the temperature inside</i>
<i>and outside to be equalized.</i>

16:21.410 --> 16:24.743
<i>Humason prepared the sensitive</i>
<i>photographic emulsions...</i>

16:24.947 --> 16:26.972
<i>... sheathed in their metal holders...</i>

16:27.182 --> 16:29.207
<i>... to capture with</i>
<i>the giant telescope...</i>

16:29.418 --> 16:32.649
<i>... the faint light</i>
<i>from remote galaxies.</i>

16:33.956 --> 16:36.481
<i>This was part of</i>
<i>a systematic program...</i>

16:36.692 --> 16:40.822
<i>... which Humason and his mentor,</i>
<i>the astronomer Edwin Hubble...</i>

16:41.030 --> 16:43.328
<i>... were pursuing to measure</i>
<i>the Doppler shift...</i>

16:43.532 --> 16:46.797
<i>... of light from the most distant</i>
<i>galaxies then known.</i>

16:50.739 --> 16:53.503
<i>But the most distant galaxies are</i>
<i>very faint.</i>

16:53.709 --> 16:56.769
<i>That's why even with the largest</i>
<i>telescope in the world...</i>

16:56.979 --> 17:00.073
<i>... it was necessary to take very long</i>
<i>time exposures...</i>

17:00.282 --> 17:01.613
<i>... often lasting all night...</i>

17:01.817 --> 17:04.843
<i>... and sometimes requiring</i>
<i>several successive nights.</i>

17:06.555 --> 17:10.116
<i>Humason would give the night assistant</i>
<i>the celestial coordinates...</i>

17:10.326 --> 17:12.226
<i>... of the target galaxy.</i>

17:21.337 --> 17:24.966
<i>Through the long, cold night,</i>
<i>he'd have to make fine adjustments...</i>

17:25.174 --> 17:28.837
<i>... so the telescope would precisely</i>
<i>track the target galaxy.</i>

17:29.044 --> 17:32.411
<i>The galaxy itself was too faint</i>
<i>to see through the telescope...</i>

17:32.648 --> 17:35.242
<i>... although it could be recorded</i>
<i>photographically...</i>

17:35.484 --> 17:36.849
<i>... with a long time exposure.</i>

17:38.387 --> 17:41.914
<i>So the telescope would be pointed</i>
<i>at a nearby bright star...</i>

17:42.124 --> 17:45.924
<i>... and then offset to</i>
<i>a featureless patch of sky...</i>

17:46.195 --> 17:48.163
<i>... from which, over the long night...</i>

17:48.364 --> 17:52.198
<i>... the light from the unseen galaxy</i>
<i>would slowly accumulate.</i>

17:53.302 --> 17:55.930
<i>The telescope focused the faint</i>
<i>light from a galaxy...</i>

17:56.138 --> 17:57.435
<i>... into the spectrometer...</i>

17:57.639 --> 18:01.632
<i>... where it was spread out into</i>
<i>its rainbow of constituent colors.</i>

18:01.844 --> 18:05.780
<i>The spectrum would be recorded on</i>
<i>the little glass plates.</i>

18:05.981 --> 18:09.712
Would you clamp in the drive and slue
to the focus star, please?

18:10.686 --> 18:11.846
Are you clear?

18:12.321 --> 18:15.984
NELSON: I'm going to slue to the east.
- Yes. I think I'm clear.

18:16.658 --> 18:18.649
HUMASON:
Just take it easy.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.404
All right, I have it.

18:40.682 --> 18:43.981
Now, let's go to NGC 7-6-1-9.

18:44.186 --> 18:45.619
I'm clear.

18:49.224 --> 18:52.125
Going to do a 10-hour exposure.

18:55.364 --> 18:56.524
What time is it?

18:56.732 --> 18:58.563
7:15.

18:58.801 --> 19:00.200
HUMASON:
Lights out, please.

19:05.607 --> 19:07.837
The dark slide is open.

19:19.321 --> 19:23.223
SAGAN: <i>A large telescope views</i>
<i>only a tiny patch of sky.</i>

19:23.459 --> 19:26.826
<i>As the Earth turns,</i>
<i>a guide star or a galaxy...</i>

19:27.029 --> 19:31.056
<i>... would drift out of the telescope's</i>
<i>field of view in only a few minutes.</i>

19:31.300 --> 19:34.235
<i>Humason had to stay awake,</i>
<i>tracking the galaxy...</i>

19:34.470 --> 19:37.405
<i>... while elaborate machinery moved</i>
<i>the telescope...</i>

19:37.606 --> 19:41.542
<i>... slowly in the opposite direction,</i>
<i>to compensate for Earth's rotation.</i>

19:41.743 --> 19:44.678
<i>The telescope is a kind of clock.</i>

19:46.682 --> 19:47.876
HUMASON:
How's the dome?

19:51.353 --> 19:52.786
You're clear.

19:57.392 --> 20:01.988
SAGAN: <i>This work was difficult,</i>
<i>routine, tedious...</i>

20:02.197 --> 20:04.165
<i>... but although they</i>
<i>didn't yet know it...</i>

20:04.366 --> 20:07.335
<i>... Hubble and Humason were</i>
<i>meticulously accumulating...</i>

20:07.536 --> 20:10.437
<i>... the evidence for the big bang.</i>

20:11.540 --> 20:14.202
<i>They had found that</i>
<i>the more distant the galaxy...</i>

20:14.576 --> 20:18.876
<i>... the more its spectrum of colors was</i>
<i>shifted to the red.</i>

20:22.551 --> 20:24.041
HUMASON:
All right, clear the telescope.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.854
I'm coming down now.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.723
<i>If this red shift were due to</i>
<i>the Doppler effect...</i>

20:30.926 --> 20:33.588
<i>... the distant galaxies must be</i>
<i>running away from us.</i>

20:34.997 --> 20:36.555
<i>At the end of his vigil...</i>

20:36.765 --> 20:40.064
<i>... Humason would retrieve</i>
<i>the tiny galactic spectrum...</i>

20:40.269 --> 20:43.466
<i>... and carefully carry it down</i>
<i>to be developed.</i>

20:49.545 --> 20:51.604
Thank you, Mr. Nelson.

20:52.648 --> 20:55.173
I'm going to the darkroom now.

20:57.519 --> 20:59.487
- Good day.
- Good day, sir.

21:04.326 --> 21:05.384
<i>In this way...</i>

21:05.627 --> 21:09.154
<i>... Humason found a red shift</i>
<i>in almost every galaxy he examined...</i>

21:09.364 --> 21:12.765
<i>... like the Doppler shift in</i>
<i>the sound of a receding locomotive.</i>

21:12.968 --> 21:17.098
<i>And the farther away from us they</i>
<i>were, the faster they were receding.</i>

21:21.043 --> 21:24.774
<i>Tied to the fabric of space,</i>
<i>the outward rushing galaxies...</i>

21:25.013 --> 21:29.245
<i>... were tracing the expansion</i>
<i>of the universe itself.</i>

21:29.451 --> 21:34.388
<i>An awesome conclusion had been</i>
<i>captured on these tiny glass slides.</i>

21:35.424 --> 21:39.918
<i>Humason and Hubble had discovered</i>
<i>the big bang.</i>

21:44.733 --> 21:46.928
<i>At top and bottom are</i>
<i>calibration lines...</i>

21:47.135 --> 21:49.000
<i>... that Humason had</i>
<i>earlier photographed.</i>

21:49.204 --> 21:53.231
<i>In the middle is the spectrum</i>
<i>of a relatively nearby galaxy.</i>

21:53.475 --> 21:57.411
<i>Every element has a characteristic</i>
<i>spectral fingerprint...</i>

21:57.613 --> 22:00.081
<i>... a set of frequencies</i>
<i>where light is absorbed.</i>

22:00.315 --> 22:03.773
<i>Prominent here are</i>
<i>two dark lines in the violet...</i>

22:03.986 --> 22:06.079
<i>... due to calcium</i>
<i>in the atmospheres...</i>

22:06.288 --> 22:08.518
<i>... of the hundreds of billions</i>
<i>of stars...</i>

22:08.724 --> 22:10.817
<i>... that constitute this galaxy.</i>

22:11.026 --> 22:14.723
<i>Nearby galaxies show very little</i>
<i>Doppler shift.</i>

22:15.464 --> 22:18.900
<i>But when he recorded the spectrum of</i>
<i>a fainter and more distant galaxy...</i>

22:19.101 --> 22:21.831
<i>... he found the same</i>
<i>telltale pair of lines...</i>

22:22.037 --> 22:24.733
<i>... but shifted farther right</i>
<i>toward the red.</i>

22:24.940 --> 22:28.706
<i>And when he examined a remote galaxy</i>
<i>4 billion light-years away...</i>

22:28.910 --> 22:31.504
<i>... he found the lines were</i>
<i>red-shifted even more.</i>

22:31.713 --> 22:36.650
<i>This galaxy must be receding</i>
<i>at 200 million kilometers an hour.</i>

22:39.321 --> 22:42.449
<i>The painstaking observations</i>
<i>of Milton Humason...</i>

22:42.658 --> 22:45.525
<i>... astronomer and former</i>
<i>mule-team driver...</i>

22:45.727 --> 22:49.458
<i>... established the expansion</i>
<i>of the universe.</i>

22:55.771 --> 22:59.673
In discussing the large-scale
structure of the cosmos...

22:59.875 --> 23:04.005
...astronomers sometimes say
that space is curved...

23:04.312 --> 23:09.249
...or that the universe is
finite but unbounded.

23:09.685 --> 23:11.516
Whatever are they talking about?

23:12.454 --> 23:14.752
Let's imagine that we are
perfectly flat...

23:14.990 --> 23:17.220
...I mean, absolutely flat...

23:17.426 --> 23:21.385
...and that we live,
appropriately enough, in Flatland...

23:21.596 --> 23:26.499
...a land designed and named
by Edwin Abbott...

23:26.702 --> 23:30.160
...a Shakespearean scholar
who lived in Victorian England.

23:30.439 --> 23:34.068
Everybody in Flatland is,
of course, exceptionally flat.

23:34.443 --> 23:36.775
We have squares, circles, triangles...

23:37.012 --> 23:38.912
...and we all scurry about...

23:39.114 --> 23:43.847
...and we can go into our houses
and do our flat business.

23:46.054 --> 23:50.787
Now, we have width and length...

23:50.992 --> 23:53.222
...but no height at all.

23:53.462 --> 23:56.488
These cutouts have some height,
but let's ignore that.

23:56.698 --> 23:59.633
Let's imagine that these
are absolutely flat.

24:00.168 --> 24:04.070
That being the case, we know,
us Flatlanders...

24:04.272 --> 24:07.139
...about left-right
and about forward-back...

24:07.342 --> 24:10.175
...but we have never heard of up-down.

24:10.445 --> 24:14.142
Let us imagine that into Flatland...

24:14.349 --> 24:15.873
...hovering above it...

24:16.084 --> 24:18.678
...comes a strange
three-dimensional creature...

24:18.887 --> 24:22.254
...which, oddly enough,
looks like an apple.

24:22.457 --> 24:24.618
The three-dimensional creature...

24:24.826 --> 24:28.262
...sees an attractive
congenial-looking square...

24:28.497 --> 24:30.931
...watches it enter its house...

24:31.133 --> 24:36.070
...and decides in a gesture
of inter-dimensional amity...

24:36.338 --> 24:37.669
...to say hello.

24:37.939 --> 24:40.373
"Hello," says
the three-dimensional creature.

24:40.575 --> 24:44.067
"How are you? I am a visitor
from the third dimension."

24:44.446 --> 24:49.383
Well, the poor square looks around
his closed house...

24:49.751 --> 24:51.378
...sees no one there...

24:51.586 --> 24:56.216
...and what's more, has witnessed
a greeting coming from his insides:

24:56.458 --> 24:58.790
A voice from within.

24:58.994 --> 25:03.260
He surely is getting
a little worried about his sanity.

25:03.999 --> 25:05.967
The three-dimensional creature...

25:06.168 --> 25:10.229
...is unhappy about being considered
a psychological aberration...

25:10.472 --> 25:15.375
...and so he descends to
actually enter Flatland.

25:15.577 --> 25:19.638
Now, a three-dimensional creature
exists in Flatland only partially...

25:19.848 --> 25:24.785
...only a plane, a cross section
through him can be seen.

25:25.086 --> 25:28.249
So when the three-dimensional creature
first reaches Flatland...

25:28.456 --> 25:30.981
...only its points of contact
can be seen.

25:31.193 --> 25:36.130
And we'll represent that by stamping
the apple in this ink pad...

25:36.865 --> 25:40.767
...and placing that image in Flatland.

25:41.369 --> 25:45.499
And as the apple were
to descend through...

25:45.707 --> 25:48.107
...slither by Flatland...

25:48.310 --> 25:50.972
...we would progressively see
higher and higher slices...

25:51.179 --> 25:52.806
...which we can represent...

25:53.014 --> 25:57.474
...by cutting the apple.

25:59.287 --> 26:03.690
So the square, as time goes on...

26:03.892 --> 26:07.851
...sees a set of objects
mysteriously appear...

26:08.096 --> 26:11.623
...from nowhere,
and inside a closed room...

26:11.833 --> 26:14.859
...and change their shape
dramatically.

26:15.270 --> 26:18.637
His only conclusion could be
that he's gone bonkers.

26:18.840 --> 26:22.901
Well, the apple might be a little
annoyed at this conclusion...

26:23.144 --> 26:27.240
...and so not such a friendly gesture
from dimension to dimension...

26:27.449 --> 26:30.509
...makes a contact with
the square from below...

26:30.719 --> 26:32.414
...and sends our flat creature...

26:32.654 --> 26:36.021
...fluttering and spinning
above Flatland.

26:36.224 --> 26:38.658
At first, the square has
no idea what's happening.

26:38.860 --> 26:42.660
He's terribly confused. This is
utterly outside his experience.

26:42.864 --> 26:45.765
But after a while, he comes
to realize...

26:45.967 --> 26:50.802
...that he is seeing inside
closed rooms in Flatland.

26:51.006 --> 26:54.635
He is looking inside
his fellow flat creatures:

26:54.843 --> 26:56.868
He is seeing Flatland
from a perspective...

26:57.078 --> 26:59.638
...no one has ever seen it before,
to his knowledge.

26:59.848 --> 27:03.215
Getting into another dimension
provides, as an incidental benefit...

27:03.418 --> 27:05.818
...a kind of x-ray vision.

27:06.054 --> 27:10.616
Now our flat creature slowly
descends to the surface...

27:10.825 --> 27:14.955
...and his friends rush up
to see him.

27:15.163 --> 27:18.291
From their point of view, he has
mysteriously appeared from nowhere.

27:18.500 --> 27:22.869
He hasn't walked from somewhere else.
He's come from some other place.

27:23.138 --> 27:25.800
They say, "For heaven's sake,
what's happened to you?"

27:26.007 --> 27:28.237
And the poor square has to say:

27:28.476 --> 27:32.071
"Well, I was in some other
mystic dimension...

27:32.280 --> 27:33.975
...called 'Up."'

27:34.182 --> 27:38.312
And they will pat him on his side
and comfort him...

27:38.520 --> 27:39.680
...or else they'll ask:

27:39.888 --> 27:43.688
"Well, show us. Where is that
third dimension? Point to it."

27:43.925 --> 27:47.292
And the poor square will be
unable to comply.

27:47.595 --> 27:49.586
But maybe more interesting...

27:49.798 --> 27:52.631
...is the other direction
in dimensionality.

27:52.834 --> 27:55.769
What about the fourth dimension?

27:56.938 --> 27:59.566
Now, to approach that,
let's consider a cube.

28:00.275 --> 28:02.368
We can imagine a cube
in the following way:

28:02.577 --> 28:07.071
Take a line segment and move it at
right angles to itself in equal length.

28:07.282 --> 28:08.806
That makes a square.

28:09.017 --> 28:12.043
Move that square in equal length
at right angles to itself...

28:12.287 --> 28:14.312
...and you have a cube.

28:14.522 --> 28:19.255
Now, this cube, we understand...

28:20.028 --> 28:21.825
...casts a shadow.

28:24.799 --> 28:27.461
And that shadow we recognize...

28:27.669 --> 28:31.867
It's, you know, ordinarily drawn
in third-grade classrooms...

28:32.240 --> 28:36.074
...as two squares with
their vertices connected.

28:36.277 --> 28:40.646
If we look at a three-dimensional
object's shadow in two dimensions...

28:40.849 --> 28:44.307
...we see that, in this case,
not all the lines appear equal.

28:44.519 --> 28:46.350
Not all the angles are right angles.

28:46.588 --> 28:49.318
The 3-D object hasn't been
perfectly represented...

28:49.524 --> 28:51.253
...in its projection
in two dimensions.

28:51.459 --> 28:56.260
But that's part of the cost of losing
a dimension in the projection.

28:58.466 --> 29:01.765
Now, let's take this
three-dimensional cube...

29:01.970 --> 29:06.669
...and project it, carry it through
a fourth physical dimension:

29:06.875 --> 29:10.606
Not that way, not that way,
not that way.

29:10.812 --> 29:13.337
But at right angles to
those three directions.

29:13.548 --> 29:15.175
I can't show you that direction.

29:15.383 --> 29:18.284
But imagine that there is
a fourth physical dimension.

29:18.486 --> 29:22.946
In that case, we would generate
a four-dimensional hyper-cube...

29:23.158 --> 29:25.183
...which is also called a tesseract.

29:25.393 --> 29:28.556
I cannot show you a tesseract
because I and you...

29:28.763 --> 29:30.731
...are trapped in three dimensions.

29:30.965 --> 29:35.561
But what I can show you is
the shadow in three dimensions...

29:35.804 --> 29:38.898
...of a four-dimensional hyper-cube
or tesseract.

29:39.107 --> 29:43.737
This is it, and you can see
its two nested cubes...

29:43.978 --> 29:47.038
...all the vertices connected
by lines.

29:47.248 --> 29:51.309
And now the real tesseract
in four dimensions...

29:51.519 --> 29:55.285
...would have all lines of equal
length and all angles right angles.

29:55.623 --> 30:00.390
That's not what we see here,
but that's the penalty of projection.

30:00.995 --> 30:05.932
So you see, while we cannot imagine
the world of four dimensions...

30:06.534 --> 30:10.766
...we can certainly think about it
perfectly well.

30:11.806 --> 30:15.105
<i>Now, imagine a universe</i>
<i>just like Flatland...</i>

30:15.310 --> 30:19.610
<i>... truly two-dimensional and entirely</i>
<i>flat in every direction.</i>

30:19.848 --> 30:21.713
<i>But with one exception:</i>

30:22.450 --> 30:24.714
<i>Unbeknownst to the inhabitants...</i>

30:24.919 --> 30:27.217
<i>... their two-dimensional universe</i>
<i>is curved...</i>

30:27.422 --> 30:29.788
<i>... into a third physical dimension.</i>

30:29.991 --> 30:32.357
<i>Maybe into a sphere,</i>
<i>but at any rate...</i>

30:32.560 --> 30:35.461
<i>... into something entirely outside</i>
<i>their experience.</i>

30:37.332 --> 30:40.301
Locally, their universe still looks
flat enough.

30:40.502 --> 30:44.563
But if one of them,
much smaller and flatter than me...

30:44.806 --> 30:48.799
...takes a very long walk along what
seems to be a straight line...

30:49.010 --> 30:51.570
...he would uncover a great mystery.

30:51.779 --> 30:55.215
Suppose he marked
his starting point here...

30:55.416 --> 30:59.375
...and set off to explore
his universe.

31:00.488 --> 31:03.389
<i>He never turns around</i>
<i>and he never reaches an edge.</i>

31:03.591 --> 31:07.083
<i>He doesn't know that</i>
<i>his apparently flat universe...</i>

31:07.295 --> 31:10.594
<i>... is actually curved</i>
<i>into an enormous sphere.</i>

31:10.832 --> 31:14.495
<i>He doesn't sense that he's</i>
<i>walking around a globe.</i>

31:16.371 --> 31:18.498
<i>Why should his space be curved?</i>

31:18.706 --> 31:20.799
<i>Because this universe has</i>
<i>so much matter...</i>

31:21.009 --> 31:22.943
<i>... that it gravitationally</i>
<i>warps space...</i>

31:23.178 --> 31:25.976
<i>... closing it back on itself</i>
<i>into a sphere.</i>

31:26.347 --> 31:28.611
<i>But our Flatlander doesn't</i>
<i>know this.</i>

31:28.850 --> 31:33.787
<i>After a long while, he'll find he</i>
<i>somehow returns to his starting point.</i>

31:34.055 --> 31:37.024
<i>There must be a third dimension.</i>

31:37.225 --> 31:41.059
Our Flatlander couldn't imagine
a third dimension...

31:41.296 --> 31:43.389
...but he could sure deduce it.

31:43.598 --> 31:46.226
Increase all the dimensions
in this story by one...

31:46.434 --> 31:49.096
...and you have something
like the situation...

31:49.304 --> 31:53.070
...which many cosmologists think
may actually apply to us.

31:53.308 --> 31:57.711
We are three-dimensional creatures
trapped in three dimensions.

31:57.912 --> 32:01.575
We imagine our universe to be flat
in three dimensions...

32:01.783 --> 32:05.981
...but maybe it's curved
into a fourth.

32:06.221 --> 32:09.987
We can talk about a fourth physical
dimension, but we can't experience it.

32:10.191 --> 32:12.625
No one can point to
the fourth dimension.

32:12.860 --> 32:16.921
There's left-right and there's
forward-back. There's up-down...

32:17.131 --> 32:20.100
...and there's some
other directions...

32:20.301 --> 32:25.170
...simultaneously at right angles
to those familiar three dimensions.

32:26.074 --> 32:29.100
<i>Now, imagine this universe</i>
<i>is expanding.</i>

32:30.111 --> 32:34.172
<i>If we blow it up like a four-</i>
<i>dimensional balloon, what happens?</i>

32:34.382 --> 32:36.350
<i>An astronomer on a given galaxy...</i>

32:36.551 --> 32:40.043
<i>... thinks all the other galaxies are</i>
<i>running away from him.</i>

32:41.356 --> 32:44.689
<i>The more distant the galaxy,</i>
<i>the faster it seems to be moving.</i>

32:44.892 --> 32:48.089
<i>This is just what</i>
<i>Humason and Hubble found.</i>

32:50.231 --> 32:54.463
<i>On the surface of this curved universe,</i>
<i>there is no boundary or center.</i>

32:54.669 --> 32:59.470
<i>The universe can be</i>
<i>both finite and unbounded.</i>

33:03.244 --> 33:05.474
The red shift of
the distant galaxies...

33:05.680 --> 33:07.910
...seemed to imply to
Humason's contemporaries...

33:08.149 --> 33:10.913
...that we were at the center
of an expanding universe...

33:11.119 --> 33:13.883
...that our place in space was
somehow privileged.

33:14.088 --> 33:15.555
But if the universe is expanding...

33:15.757 --> 33:18.419
...whether or not it's curved
into a fourth dimension...

33:18.660 --> 33:22.494
...observers on every galaxy will see
precisely the same thing:

33:22.697 --> 33:25.165
All the galaxies rushing
away from them...

33:25.366 --> 33:30.269
...as if they had made some dreadful
intergalactic social blunder.

33:30.505 --> 33:33.997
If there's enough matter to close
the universe gravitationally...

33:34.208 --> 33:37.439
...then it's wrapped in on itself
like a sphere.

33:39.180 --> 33:42.775
If there isn't enough matter
to close the cosmos...

33:42.984 --> 33:45.384
...then our universe has
an open shape...

33:45.620 --> 33:49.021
...extending forever
in all directions.

33:49.524 --> 33:53.858
This saddle universe is only one
of an infinite number...

33:54.062 --> 33:57.190
...of possible kinds of
open universes.

33:57.398 --> 34:00.299
Unlike such closed universes
as the sphere...

34:00.501 --> 34:05.165
...open universes have in them
an infinite amount of space.

34:07.375 --> 34:09.843
<i>If our universe is,</i>
<i>in fact, closed off...</i>

34:10.044 --> 34:13.536
<i>... then nothing can get out,</i>
<i>not matter, not light.</i>

34:13.748 --> 34:16.683
<i>We would then be living inside</i>
<i>a black hole.</i>

34:16.918 --> 34:19.182
<i>There is one possible</i>
<i>way out, though:</i>

34:19.387 --> 34:24.222
<i>A hypothetical tunnel or wormhole</i>
<i>through the next higher dimension...</i>

34:24.425 --> 34:27.758
<i>... a place sucking in</i>
<i>matter and light.</i>

34:29.230 --> 34:33.030
<i>Can we find such a wormhole?</i>
<i>Could we survive the trip?</i>

34:35.670 --> 34:38.400
<i>We might emerge in some other</i>
<i>place and time...</i>

34:38.606 --> 34:40.233
<i>... perhaps in another universe...</i>

34:40.441 --> 34:43.535
<i>... or perhaps somewhere else</i>
<i>in our own.</i>

34:45.947 --> 34:49.815
If you want to know what it's like
inside a black hole...

34:50.017 --> 34:51.678
...look around.

34:52.453 --> 34:57.390
But we don't yet know whether
the universe is open or closed.

34:57.592 --> 35:00.117
More than that,
some astronomers doubt...

35:00.328 --> 35:02.694
...that the red shift
of distant galaxies...

35:02.897 --> 35:04.455
...is due to the Doppler effect.

35:04.799 --> 35:09.236
They are skeptical about the expanding
universe and the big bang.

35:09.437 --> 35:13.533
Perhaps our descendants will regard
our present ignorance...

35:13.741 --> 35:17.404
...with as much sympathy as we feel
to the ancients...

35:17.612 --> 35:20.308
...for not knowing whether the Earth
went around the sun.

35:21.015 --> 35:23.848
If the general picture, however,
of a big bang...

35:24.051 --> 35:27.452
...followed by an expanding universe
is correct...

35:27.655 --> 35:29.213
...what happened before that?

35:29.424 --> 35:32.860
Was the universe devoid
of all matter...

35:33.060 --> 35:35.585
...and then the matter suddenly
somehow created?

35:35.797 --> 35:37.594
How did that happen?

35:38.099 --> 35:40.932
In many cultures,
the customary answer...

35:41.135 --> 35:45.970
...is that a god or gods created
the universe out of nothing.

35:46.674 --> 35:50.075
But if we wish to pursue
this question courageously...

35:50.278 --> 35:53.179
...we must, of course,
ask the next question:

35:53.381 --> 35:55.372
Where did God come from?

35:55.583 --> 35:58.347
If we decide that this is
an unanswerable question...

35:58.553 --> 36:00.987
...why not save a step and conclude...

36:01.189 --> 36:04.989
...that the origin of the universe is
an unanswerable question?

36:05.193 --> 36:08.822
Or if we say that God
always existed...

36:09.030 --> 36:11.225
...why not save a step and conclude...

36:11.432 --> 36:13.263
...that the universe always existed?

36:13.468 --> 36:16.062
There's no need for a creation.
It was always here.

36:16.270 --> 36:18.067
These are not easy questions.

36:18.272 --> 36:20.832
Cosmology brings us face to face...

36:21.042 --> 36:22.873
...with the deepest mysteries...

36:23.077 --> 36:27.844
...with questions that were once
treated only in religion and myth.

36:39.460 --> 36:41.223
<i>"Who knows for certain?</i>

36:41.429 --> 36:43.522
<i>Who shall here declare it?</i>

36:43.731 --> 36:47.030
<i>Whence was it born?</i>
<i>Whence came creation?</i>

36:47.635 --> 36:51.332
<i>The gods are later than</i>
<i>this world's formation.</i>

36:51.906 --> 36:55.899
<i>Who then can know</i>
<i>the origins of the world?</i>

36:57.912 --> 37:00.506
<i>None knows whence creation arose...</i>

37:00.715 --> 37:03.047
<i>... or whether He has</i>
<i>or has not made it...</i>

37:03.251 --> 37:07.051
<i>... He who surveys it</i>
<i>from the lofty skies.</i>

37:07.255 --> 37:08.916
<i>Only He knows...</i>

37:09.457 --> 37:12.517
<i>... or perhaps He knows not."</i>

37:16.531 --> 37:19.932
<i>These words are 3500 years old.</i>

37:20.134 --> 37:21.965
<i>They're taken from the Rig-Veda...</i>

37:22.169 --> 37:24.865
<i>... a collection of early</i>
<i>Sanskrit hymns.</i>

37:25.072 --> 37:28.974
<i>The most sophisticated ancient</i>
<i>cosmological ideas came from Asia...</i>

37:29.176 --> 37:31.440
<i>... and particularly from India.</i>

37:31.646 --> 37:35.605
<i>Here, there's a tradition</i>
<i>of skeptical questioning...</i>

37:35.816 --> 37:40.480
<i>... and unselfconscious humility</i>
<i>before the great cosmic mysteries.</i>

37:41.422 --> 37:43.947
<i>Amidst the routine of daily life...</i>

37:44.158 --> 37:46.922
<i>... in, say, the harvesting</i>
<i>and winnowing of grain...</i>

37:47.128 --> 37:49.528
<i>... people all over the world</i>
<i>have wondered:</i>

37:49.730 --> 37:53.393
<i>Where did the universe come from?</i>

37:53.601 --> 37:57.628
<i>Asking this question is</i>
<i>a hallmark of our species.</i>

38:04.378 --> 38:06.243
<i>There's a natural tendency</i>
<i>to understand...</i>

38:06.447 --> 38:10.474
<i>... the origin of the cosmos</i>
<i>in familiar biological terms.</i>

38:10.685 --> 38:12.778
<i>The mating of cosmic deities...</i>

38:12.987 --> 38:14.545
<i>... or the hatching of a cosmic egg...</i>

38:14.755 --> 38:18.213
<i>... or maybe the intonation</i>
<i>of some magic phrase.</i>

38:26.601 --> 38:30.537
<i>The big bang is our modern</i>
<i>scientific creation myth.</i>

38:30.738 --> 38:32.899
<i>It comes from the same human need...</i>

38:33.107 --> 38:35.007
<i>... to solve the cosmological riddle.</i>

38:37.244 --> 38:38.905
<i>Most cultures imagined the world...</i>

38:39.113 --> 38:41.604
<i>... to be only a few hundred</i>
<i>generations old.</i>

38:41.816 --> 38:45.718
<i>Hardly anyone guessed that</i>
<i>the cosmos might be far older.</i>

38:45.920 --> 38:48.218
<i>But the ancient Hindus did.</i>

38:53.427 --> 38:56.021
<i>They, like every other society...</i>

38:56.230 --> 38:59.825
<i>... noted and calibrated</i>
<i>the cycles in nature.</i>

39:01.102 --> 39:04.594
<i>The rising and setting</i>
<i>of the sun and the stars...</i>

39:07.141 --> 39:09.200
<i>... the phases of the moon...</i>

39:12.480 --> 39:14.812
<i>... the passing of the seasons.</i>

39:25.426 --> 39:28.657
<i>All over South India,</i>
<i>an age-old ceremony...</i>

39:28.863 --> 39:30.831
<i>... takes place every January...</i>

39:31.032 --> 39:33.159
<i>... a rejoicing in the</i>
<i>generosity of nature...</i>

39:33.367 --> 39:35.835
<i>... in the annual harvesting</i>
<i>of the crops.</i>

39:36.037 --> 39:40.167
<i>Every January, nature provides</i>
<i>the rice to celebrate Pongal.</i>

39:42.476 --> 39:46.913
<i>Even the draft animals are given the</i>
<i>day off and garlanded with flowers.</i>

39:48.115 --> 39:51.846
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

39:58.759 --> 40:02.490
<i>Colorful designs are painted</i>
<i>on the ground to attract harmony...</i>

40:02.697 --> 40:05.393
<i>... and good fortune</i>
<i>for the coming year.</i>

40:32.426 --> 40:37.363
<i>Pongal, a simple porridge,</i>
<i>a mixture of rice and sweet milk...</i>

40:37.565 --> 40:40.728
<i>... symbolizes the harvest,</i>
<i>the return of the seasons.</i>

40:45.406 --> 40:49.433
(SHOUTING)

40:53.414 --> 40:56.906
<i>However, this is not merely</i>
<i>a harvest festival.</i>

40:57.118 --> 41:02.283
<i>It has ties to an elegant and</i>
<i>much deeper cosmological tradition.</i>

41:14.135 --> 41:17.195
<i>The Pongal festival is</i>
<i>a rejoicing in the fact...</i>

41:17.404 --> 41:19.634
<i>... that there are cycles in nature.</i>

41:20.274 --> 41:23.402
<i>But how could such cycles come about</i>
<i>unless the gods will them?</i>

41:24.011 --> 41:27.174
And if there are cycles
in the years of humans...

41:27.381 --> 41:31.784
...might there not be cycles
in the eons of the gods?

41:32.419 --> 41:34.944
Hinduism is the only one
of the world's great faiths...

41:35.156 --> 41:39.456
...dedicated to the idea
that the cosmos itself...

41:39.660 --> 41:42.959
...undergoes an immense,
indeed, an infinite...

41:43.164 --> 41:46.099
...number of deaths and rebirths.

42:02.082 --> 42:05.483
It is the only religion in which
the time scales correspond...

42:05.686 --> 42:09.417
...no doubt by accident, to those
of modern scientific cosmology.

42:09.623 --> 42:12.820
Its cycles run from our
ordinary day and night...

42:13.027 --> 42:15.655
...to a day and night of Brahma...

42:15.863 --> 42:19.230
...8.64 billion years long...

42:19.533 --> 42:22.832
...longer than the age
of the Earth or the sun...

42:23.037 --> 42:25.904
...and about half the time
since the big bang.

42:26.106 --> 42:30.008
And there are much longer
time scales still.

42:38.652 --> 42:41.280
There is the deep
and appealing notion...

42:41.488 --> 42:45.925
...that the universe is
but the dream of the god...

42:46.527 --> 42:50.657
...who after 100 Brahma years...

42:50.865 --> 42:54.460
...dissolves himself into
a dreamless sleep...

42:54.835 --> 42:57.633
...and the universe
dissolves with him.

42:58.205 --> 43:02.904
Until, after another
Brahma century, he stirs...

43:03.110 --> 43:06.546
...recomposes himself
and begins again...

43:06.747 --> 43:10.342
...to dream the great
cosmic lotus dream.

43:14.922 --> 43:18.153
Meanwhile, elsewhere...

43:18.359 --> 43:21.726
...there are an infinite number
of other universes...

43:21.929 --> 43:24.727
...each with its own god...

43:24.932 --> 43:27.901
...dreaming the cosmic dream.

43:30.104 --> 43:34.473
<i>These great ideas are</i>
<i>tempered by another...</i>

43:34.675 --> 43:36.575
<i>... perhaps still greater.</i>

43:37.044 --> 43:38.568
<i>It is said...</i>

43:38.879 --> 43:42.610
<i>... that men may not be</i>
<i>the dreams of the gods...</i>

43:42.816 --> 43:45.512
<i>... but rather that the gods...</i>

43:45.719 --> 43:48.483
<i>... are the dreams of men.</i>

43:53.460 --> 43:55.451
In India, there are many gods...

43:55.663 --> 43:59.099
...and each god has many
manifestations.

43:59.300 --> 44:02.599
These Chola bronzes cast
in the 11 th century...

44:02.803 --> 44:07.069
...include several different
incarnations of the god Shiva...

44:07.274 --> 44:09.765
...seen here at his wedding.

44:11.011 --> 44:13.980
The most elegant and sublime
of these bronzes...

44:14.181 --> 44:17.617
...is a representation of
the creation of the universe...

44:17.818 --> 44:20.218
...at the beginning
of each cosmic cycle:

44:20.788 --> 44:24.622
A motif known as
the cosmic dance of Shiva.

44:25.326 --> 44:27.624
The god has four hands.

44:27.828 --> 44:30.888
In the upper right hand is a drum...

44:31.098 --> 44:35.330
...whose sound is
the sound of creation.

44:35.569 --> 44:38.732
In the upper left hand
is a tongue of flame...

44:38.939 --> 44:43.467
...a reminder that the universe,
now newly created...

44:43.677 --> 44:48.580
...will, billions of years from now,
be utterly destroyed.

44:48.782 --> 44:51.717
Creation, destruction.

45:16.076 --> 45:19.568
These profound and lovely ideas...

45:19.780 --> 45:22.874
...are central to ancient
Hindu beliefs...

45:23.083 --> 45:28.020
...as exemplified in this
Chola temple at Darasuram.

45:29.023 --> 45:33.517
They're a kind of premonition
of modern astronomical ideas.

45:34.028 --> 45:37.759
Without doubt, the universe has been
expanding since the big bang...

45:37.965 --> 45:42.527
...but it is, by no means, clear that
it will continue to expand forever.

45:42.736 --> 45:46.968
If there is less than a certain
amount of matter in the universe...

45:47.174 --> 45:50.803
...then the mutual gravitation
of the receding galaxies...

45:51.011 --> 45:54.242
...will be insufficient
to stop the expansion...

45:54.448 --> 45:57.417
...and the universe will
run away forever.

45:57.785 --> 46:00.811
But if there is more matter
than we can see...

46:01.021 --> 46:04.013
...hidden away in black holes, say...

46:04.224 --> 46:07.625
...or in hot but invisible gas
between the galaxies...

46:07.828 --> 46:10.296
...then the universe holds together...

46:10.497 --> 46:13.660
...and partakes of a very Indian
succession of cycles...

46:13.867 --> 46:16.665
...expansion followed
by contraction...

46:16.870 --> 46:21.432
...cosmos upon cosmos,
universes without end.

46:21.675 --> 46:24.235
If we live in such
an oscillating universe...

46:24.445 --> 46:27.107
...the big bang is not
the creation of the cosmos...

46:27.314 --> 46:29.874
...but merely the end
of the previous cycle...

46:30.084 --> 46:34.953
...the destruction of the last
incarnation of the cosmos.

46:36.056 --> 46:38.616
Neither of these modern cosmologies...

46:38.826 --> 46:41.317
...may be altogether to our liking.

46:41.595 --> 46:46.430
In one cosmology, the universe
is created somehow...

46:46.633 --> 46:49.932
...from nothing
15 to 20 billion years ago...

46:50.237 --> 46:51.966
...and expands forever...

46:52.172 --> 46:55.869
...the galaxies mutually receding
until the last one...

46:56.076 --> 46:59.876
...disappears over our cosmic horizon.

47:00.214 --> 47:04.583
Then the galactic astronomers
are out of business...

47:04.785 --> 47:09.722
...the stars cool and die,
matter itself decays...

47:09.990 --> 47:11.821
...and the universe becomes...

47:12.025 --> 47:16.485
...a thin, cold haze
of elementary particles.

47:16.697 --> 47:20.098
In the other,
the oscillating universe...

47:20.300 --> 47:23.030
...the cosmos has no beginning
and no end...

47:23.237 --> 47:25.603
...and we are in the midst
of an infinite cycle...

47:25.806 --> 47:29.742
...of cosmic deaths and rebirths
with no information...

47:29.943 --> 47:33.743
...trickling through the cusps
of the oscillation.

47:33.947 --> 47:38.008
Nothing of the galaxies,
stars, planets...

47:38.218 --> 47:40.152
...life forms, civilizations...

47:40.354 --> 47:43.721
...evolved in the previous
incarnation of the universe...

47:43.924 --> 47:46.154
...trickles through the cusp...

47:46.360 --> 47:48.191
...flitters past the big bang...

47:48.395 --> 47:51.159
...to be known in our universe.

47:56.303 --> 47:59.602
The death of the universe
in either cosmology...

47:59.806 --> 48:02.206
...may seem a little depressing.

48:02.409 --> 48:06.675
But we may take some solace
in the time scales involved.

48:06.880 --> 48:11.817
These events will take tens
of billions of years or more.

48:12.085 --> 48:16.454
<i>Human beings, or our descendants,</i>
<i>whoever they might be...</i>

48:16.657 --> 48:20.525
<i>... can do a great deal of good</i>
<i>in tens of billions of years...</i>

48:20.727 --> 48:23.696
<i>... before the cosmos dies.</i>

48:41.448 --> 48:43.473
If the universe truly oscillates...

48:43.684 --> 48:47.848
...if the modern scientific version
of the old Hindu cosmology is valid...

48:48.055 --> 48:50.580
...then still stranger
questions arise.

48:50.791 --> 48:53.453
Some scientists think
that when a red shift...

48:53.660 --> 48:55.821
...is followed by blue shift...

48:56.029 --> 48:58.964
...causality will be inverted...

48:59.166 --> 49:02.397
...and effects will precede causes.

49:02.736 --> 49:04.795
First, the ripples spread out...

49:05.005 --> 49:07.064
...from a point
on the water's surface.

49:07.274 --> 49:10.710
Then I throw the stone into the pond.

49:14.581 --> 49:18.847
Some scientists wonder,
in an oscillating universe...

49:19.052 --> 49:22.146
...about what happens at the cusps...

49:22.356 --> 49:26.986
...at the transition from
contraction to expansion.

49:27.194 --> 49:30.994
Some think that the laws of nature
are then randomly reshuffled...

49:31.198 --> 49:34.565
...that the physics and chemistry
we have in this universe...

49:34.768 --> 49:37.828
...represent only one
of an infinite range...

49:38.038 --> 49:41.064
...of possible natural laws.

49:42.576 --> 49:44.203
It is easy to see...

49:44.411 --> 49:46.936
...that only a restricted range
of laws of nature...

49:47.147 --> 49:51.049
...are consistent with galaxies
and stars, planets...

49:51.251 --> 49:53.481
...life and intelligence.

49:53.687 --> 49:55.450
If the laws of nature are...

49:55.656 --> 49:58.819
...randomly reshuffled at the cusps...

49:59.326 --> 50:01.794
...then it is only the most
extraordinary coincidence...

50:01.995 --> 50:05.658
...that the cosmic slot machine
has this time come up...

50:05.866 --> 50:09.233
...with a universe
consistent with us.

50:09.803 --> 50:13.933
Do we live in a universe
which expands forever...

50:14.141 --> 50:19.078
...or in one where there is
a nested set of infinite cycles?

50:19.846 --> 50:22.144
There's a way to find out
the answer...

50:22.349 --> 50:24.977
...not by mysticism,
but through science...

50:25.185 --> 50:26.846
...by making an accurate census...

50:27.054 --> 50:30.546
...of the total amount of matter
in the universe...

50:33.427 --> 50:37.796
...or by seeing to the very edge
of the cosmos.

50:48.308 --> 50:52.335
<i>Radio telescopes are able to</i>
<i>detect distant quasars...</i>

50:52.546 --> 50:54.411
<i>... billions of light-years away...</i>

50:54.614 --> 50:58.050
<i>... expanding with</i>
<i>the fabric of space.</i>

51:00.987 --> 51:03.114
<i>By looking far out into space...</i>

51:03.323 --> 51:06.190
<i>... we are also looking</i>
<i>far back into time...</i>

51:06.393 --> 51:09.021
<i>... back toward the horizon</i>
<i>of the universe...</i>

51:09.229 --> 51:12.460
<i>... back toward the epoch</i>
<i>of the big bang.</i>

51:13.900 --> 51:16.095
<i>Radio telescopes have</i>
<i>even detected...</i>

51:16.303 --> 51:18.863
<i>... the cosmic background radiation.</i>

51:19.072 --> 51:23.236
<i>The fires of the big bang</i>
<i>cooled and red-shifted...</i>

51:23.443 --> 51:27.004
<i>... faintly echoing down</i>
<i>the corridors of time.</i>

51:36.022 --> 51:38.354
<i>This is the very large array...</i>

51:38.558 --> 51:42.221
<i>... a collection of 17 separate</i>
<i>radio telescopes...</i>

51:42.429 --> 51:44.192
<i>... all working collectively...</i>

51:44.398 --> 51:47.128
<i>... in a remote region of New Mexico.</i>

51:47.334 --> 51:51.361
<i>Modern radio telescopes are</i>
<i>exquisitely sensitive.</i>

51:51.571 --> 51:55.029
A distant quasar is so faint...

51:55.242 --> 51:59.144
...that its received radiation
by some such telescope...

51:59.346 --> 52:04.113
...amounts to maybe
a quadrillionth of a watt.

52:04.484 --> 52:08.648
In fact, and this is a reasonably
stunning piece of information...

52:08.855 --> 52:11.323
...the total amount of energy
ever received...

52:11.525 --> 52:14.119
...by all the radio telescopes
on the planet Earth...

52:14.327 --> 52:18.821
...is less than the energy
of a single snowflake...

52:19.032 --> 52:20.897
...striking the ground.

52:21.268 --> 52:24.396
<i>In detecting the cosmic</i>
<i>background radiation...</i>

52:24.604 --> 52:26.868
<i>... in counting quasars...</i>

52:27.073 --> 52:30.099
<i>... in searching for intelligent</i>
<i>signals from space...</i>

52:30.310 --> 52:33.973
<i>... radio astronomers are dealing</i>
<i>with amounts of energy...</i>

52:34.181 --> 52:35.842
<i>... which are barely there at all.</i>

52:42.355 --> 52:46.724
<i>These radio telescopes,</i>
<i>rising like giant flowers...</i>

52:46.927 --> 52:48.451
<i>... from the New Mexico desert...</i>

52:48.662 --> 52:51.654
<i>... are monuments to human ingenuity.</i>

52:54.835 --> 52:57.861
<i>The faint radio waves</i>
<i>are collected, focused...</i>

52:58.071 --> 53:01.700
<i>... assembled and amplified,</i>
<i>and then converted...</i>

53:01.908 --> 53:06.675
<i>... into pictures of nebulae,</i>
<i>galaxies and quasars.</i>

53:09.249 --> 53:11.717
<i>If you had eyes that</i>
<i>worked in radio light...</i>

53:11.918 --> 53:14.409
<i>... they'd probably be bigger</i>
<i>than wagon wheels...</i>

53:14.621 --> 53:17.112
<i>... and this is the universe you'd see.</i>

53:19.226 --> 53:21.490
<i>An elliptical galaxy, for example...</i>

53:21.695 --> 53:25.791
<i>... leaving behind it a long wake</i>
<i>glowing in radio waves.</i>

53:29.836 --> 53:32.862
<i>Radio waves reveal</i>
<i>a universe of quasars...</i>

53:33.073 --> 53:36.736
<i>... interacting galaxies,</i>
<i>titanic explosions.</i>

53:42.716 --> 53:45.879
<i>Every time we use another kind</i>
<i>of light to view the cosmos...</i>

53:46.086 --> 53:49.078
<i>... we open a new door of perception.</i>

53:51.992 --> 53:55.519
<i>As the murmurs from the edge</i>
<i>of the cosmos slowly accumulate...</i>

53:55.729 --> 53:58.596
<i>... our understanding grows.</i>

54:04.337 --> 54:08.364
<i>This is an exploration of</i>
<i>the ancient and the invisible...</i>

54:08.575 --> 54:10.805
<i>... a continuing human inquiry...</i>

54:11.011 --> 54:14.572
<i>... into the grand cosmological</i>
<i>questions.</i>

54:26.059 --> 54:28.527
Another important recent finding...

54:28.728 --> 54:32.357
...was made by x-ray observatories
in Earth orbit.

54:32.566 --> 54:36.627
Artificial satellites launched
to view the sky...

54:36.836 --> 54:40.636
...not in ordinary visible light,
not in radio waves...

54:40.840 --> 54:42.808
...but in x-ray light.

54:43.009 --> 54:46.172
There seems to be an immense cloud...

54:46.379 --> 54:48.643
...of extremely hot hydrogen...

54:48.848 --> 54:53.046
...glowing in x-rays between
some galaxies.

54:53.253 --> 54:55.721
Now, if this amount of
intergalactic matter...

54:55.922 --> 54:59.050
...were typical of all
clusters of galaxies...

54:59.259 --> 55:03.992
...then there may be just enough
matter to close the cosmos...

55:04.197 --> 55:08.759
...and to trap us forever
in an oscillating universe.

55:13.239 --> 55:15.799
<i>If the cosmos is closed...</i>

55:16.009 --> 55:19.911
<i>... there's a strange, haunting,</i>
<i>evocative possibility...</i>

55:20.113 --> 55:24.174
<i>... one of the most exquisite</i>
<i>conjectures in science or religion.</i>

55:24.384 --> 55:26.784
<i>It's entirely undemonstrated...</i>

55:26.987 --> 55:30.650
<i>... it may never be proved,</i>
<i>but it's stirring.</i>

55:30.857 --> 55:35.419
<i>Our entire universe, to the</i>
<i>farthest galaxy, we are told...</i>

55:35.629 --> 55:37.961
<i>... is no more than</i>
<i>a closed electron...</i>

55:38.164 --> 55:41.565
<i>... in a far grander universe</i>
<i>we can never see.</i>

55:41.768 --> 55:44.100
<i>That universe is only</i>
<i>an elementary particle...</i>

55:44.304 --> 55:48.798
<i>... in another still greater</i>
<i>universe and so on forever.</i>

55:49.175 --> 55:52.804
<i>Also, every electron</i>
<i>in our universe, it is claimed...</i>

55:53.013 --> 55:55.413
<i>... is an entire miniature cosmos...</i>

55:55.615 --> 56:00.314
<i>... containing galaxies and stars</i>
<i>and life and electrons.</i>

56:00.520 --> 56:04.149
<i>Every one of those electrons</i>
<i>contains a still smaller universe...</i>

56:04.357 --> 56:08.316
<i>... an infinite regression</i>
<i>up and down.</i>

56:12.098 --> 56:14.498
<i>Every human generation has asked...</i>

56:14.701 --> 56:17.602
<i>... about the origin</i>
<i>and fate of the cosmos.</i>

56:17.804 --> 56:21.501
<i>Ours is the first generation</i>
<i>with a real chance...</i>

56:21.708 --> 56:24.541
<i>... of finding some of the answers.</i>

56:25.145 --> 56:26.510
<i>One way or another...</i>

56:26.713 --> 56:31.047
<i>... we are poised at</i>
<i>the edge of forever.</i>

56:40.360 --> 56:44.854
Except for planetary exploration,
the study of galaxies and cosmology...

56:45.065 --> 56:48.432
...what this episode was about, have
undergone the greatest advances...

56:48.635 --> 56:50.830
...since <i>Cosmos</i> was first broadcast.

56:51.037 --> 56:53.870
For one thing, at last we have
a good photograph...

56:54.074 --> 56:55.905
...of our own Milky Way galaxy...

56:56.109 --> 56:59.169
...about 100,000 light-years across.

56:59.512 --> 57:00.774
Here it is.

57:05.785 --> 57:08.982
It was taken by
NASA's Coby satellite.

57:09.189 --> 57:12.158
We see it edge on, of course,
since we're embedded...

57:12.358 --> 57:14.292
...in the plane of the galaxy.

57:14.594 --> 57:16.585
But you don't need
a spacecraft to see it.

57:16.796 --> 57:19.822
If it's a clear night,
why not go out and take a look...

57:20.033 --> 57:21.660
...at the Milky Way?

57:22.368 --> 57:24.529
There's also new evidence
suggesting...

57:24.738 --> 57:28.469
...that the Milky Way is not so much
an ordinary spiral galaxy...

57:28.675 --> 57:31.576
...as a barred spiral, like this.

57:35.949 --> 57:38.816
Important work has now been done
on mapping...

57:39.018 --> 57:43.546
...how the galaxies are scattered
through intergalactic space.

57:43.890 --> 57:46.757
To the surprise of
a lot of scientists...

57:46.960 --> 57:50.123
...on a scale of hundreds
of millions of light-years...

57:50.330 --> 57:54.733
...the galaxies turn out
not to be strewn at random...

57:54.934 --> 57:57.903
...or concentrated in clusters
of galaxies...

57:58.104 --> 58:00.231
...but instead, strung out...

58:00.440 --> 58:04.843
...along odd, irregular surfaces,
like this.

58:06.079 --> 58:08.843
<i>Every dot in this computer animation...</i>

58:09.048 --> 58:10.538
<i>... is a galaxy.</i>

58:10.884 --> 58:14.320
<i>The computer lets us look at this</i>
<i>distribution of galaxies...</i>

58:14.521 --> 58:15.988
<i>... from many points of view...</i>

58:16.189 --> 58:19.181
<i>... but this is how it looks</i>
<i>from the Earth.</i>

58:19.492 --> 58:23.826
<i>There is an odd mannequin shape...</i>

58:24.030 --> 58:27.898
<i>... that is presented by</i>
<i>the distribution of galaxies.</i>

58:28.101 --> 58:30.228
<i>This work has been done...</i>

58:30.436 --> 58:32.768
<i>... mainly by Margaret Geller...</i>

58:32.972 --> 58:35.065
<i>... with her collaborator</i>
<i>John Huchra...</i>

58:35.275 --> 58:38.472
<i>... at Harvard University</i>
<i>and the Smithsonian Institution.</i>

58:47.954 --> 58:51.355
It's a little like soap bubbles
in a bathtub...

58:51.558 --> 58:53.219
...or dishwashing detergent.

58:53.426 --> 58:57.294
The galaxies are on the surfaces
of the bubbles.

58:57.497 --> 59:01.433
The insides of the bubbles seem
to have no galaxies in them at all.

59:01.634 --> 59:05.764
An average bubble is about
100 million light-years across.

59:05.972 --> 59:08.600
And that means that we've mapped
still only...

59:08.808 --> 59:11.743
...a very small volume
of the accessible universe...

59:11.945 --> 59:13.845
...the galaxies nearest to us.

59:14.047 --> 59:17.448
But pretty soon, we should be able to
extend this search out...

59:17.650 --> 59:19.242
...to enormous distances...

59:19.452 --> 59:21.852
...so far away in space,
that we're looking...

59:22.055 --> 59:25.650
...back to the time that galaxies
and their structures...

59:25.859 --> 59:27.087
...were first formed.

59:27.493 --> 59:29.984
And this poses a real problem.

59:30.196 --> 59:32.858
Most cosmologists hold
that the galaxies arise from...

59:33.066 --> 59:36.866
...a preexisting lumpiness
in the early universe...

59:37.070 --> 59:40.062
...with the little lumps
growing into galaxies.

59:40.273 --> 59:42.867
But the background radiation
from the big bang...

59:43.076 --> 59:44.543
...that fills all of space...

59:44.744 --> 59:47.338
...has now been carefully measured...

59:47.547 --> 59:51.074
...by that same Coby satellite
that took that picture.

59:51.584 --> 59:55.179
Now, those radio waves seem almost
perfectly uniform...

59:55.388 --> 59:56.685
...across the sky...

59:56.890 --> 1:00:00.451
...as if the big bang weren't
lumpy or granular at all.

1:00:00.660 --> 1:00:03.754
But if early radiation and matter
in the universe weren't lumpy...

1:00:03.963 --> 1:00:06.295
...how could individual galaxies form?

1:00:06.499 --> 1:00:08.296
How could the bubbles form?

1:00:08.501 --> 1:00:10.025
Is there a contradiction...

1:00:10.236 --> 1:00:13.137
...between the uniformity
of the big bang radio waves...

1:00:13.339 --> 1:00:15.637
...and the bubble structures
formed by the galaxies?

1:00:15.842 --> 1:00:17.173
That's the question.

1:00:17.377 --> 1:00:21.313
When our survey of galaxies reaches
out to billions of light-years...

1:00:21.514 --> 1:00:23.812
...we'll have the answer
to this question.

1:00:24.117 --> 1:00:26.483
Incidentally, maybe you're thinking...

1:00:26.686 --> 1:00:30.053
...that the bubbles imply
a bubble maker.

1:00:32.792 --> 1:00:34.692
But then I'd have to ask you:

1:00:34.894 --> 1:00:36.521
"Who made the bubble maker?"

1:00:36.729 --> 1:00:40.062
There's another infinite regress
lurking here.

1:00:40.633 --> 1:00:42.692
And to one of
the grandest questions...

1:00:42.902 --> 1:00:45.837
...whether there's enough matter
in the universe to close it...

1:00:46.039 --> 1:00:48.439
...the only fair answer is
that we don't know.

1:00:48.641 --> 1:00:50.006
If it is closed...

1:00:50.209 --> 1:00:52.177
...what is the hidden matter
that's closing it?

1:00:52.378 --> 1:00:56.007
Is it faint stars, black holes,
massive neutrinos...

1:00:56.215 --> 1:00:59.946
...some exotic kind of dark matter
unknown on Earth?

1:01:00.153 --> 1:01:01.279
We don't know.

1:01:01.487 --> 1:01:05.583
But there are reasons to think
that we'll soon find out the answers.
