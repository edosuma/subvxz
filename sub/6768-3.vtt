WEBVTT

00:05.505 --> 00:07.549
My name is Kelly Taylor.

00:07.632 --> 00:09.551
I am 22 years old.

00:09.634 --> 00:12.554
My mother's name is Jackie.

00:12.637 --> 00:15.557
My sister's name is Erin.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.643
My brother's name is David.

00:19.644 --> 00:22.480
And, as luck would have it,

00:22.564 --> 00:24.566
you are Brandon Walsh.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.484
So far, so good.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.610
{\an1}Dr. Sturla
was right.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.946
If I write it down, it really
helps me to remember.

00:33.241 --> 00:34.784
Hopefully, uh--

00:34.868 --> 00:36.244
hopefully this'll

00:36.327 --> 00:37.620
help you remember, too.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.122
I, uh...

00:40.540 --> 00:41.875
...brought you a little present.

00:42.917 --> 00:43.835
What is this?

00:43.918 --> 00:44.878
It's...

00:44.961 --> 00:46.504
your ring.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.922
{\an3}You were

00:48.006 --> 00:51.509
wearing it when you got...

00:51.593 --> 00:53.094
When I was shot?

00:53.178 --> 00:55.430
{\an1}You can say it,
Brandon.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.391
It's beautiful.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.395
Uh... were we engaged?

01:04.397 --> 01:06.316
Yes and no.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.984
{\an3}Um,

01:08.067 --> 01:10.361
I-I gave you that ring

01:10.445 --> 01:14.157
when I proposed to you
the first time.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.451
{\an3}But things didn't
go so well.

01:16.534 --> 01:19.037
So, I...

01:19.120 --> 01:21.831
I took it back to the jeweler,

01:21.915 --> 01:23.833
and...

01:23.917 --> 01:27.170
and then you went back there
and bought it back.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.507
It's been through
a lot, that ring.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.133
Kind of like the two of us.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.845
Anyway, I-I know that...

01:35.929 --> 01:37.889
that you always loved it,

01:37.972 --> 01:39.516
{\an3}and-and...

01:39.599 --> 01:42.352
I don't know, I thought you
might want to wear it.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.229
I wish I could remember.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.314
But I can't.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.359
I'm sorry.

01:51.402 --> 01:52.529
That's okay.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.364
{\an3}That's all right,
I, you know...

01:55.406 --> 01:57.408
...I understand.

01:58.785 --> 01:59.702
(knocking on door)

01:59.786 --> 02:01.371
Knock-knock.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.831
{\an4}Hey, guys.
BRANDON:
Noah.

02:02.914 --> 02:03.832
How you doing?

02:03.915 --> 02:05.542
Uh, this is

02:05.625 --> 02:06.668
Noah Hunter.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.211
{\an3}I guess you could
say he's your

02:08.294 --> 02:10.003
{\an1}blood brother now.
Oh.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.923
So you're the guy. Mr. AB

02:12.006 --> 02:13.550
{\an1}negative,

02:13.633 --> 02:15.009
just like me.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.761
Well, the doctors say

02:16.845 --> 02:18.346
that you probably
helped save my life.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.056
I don't know how I'll ever
be able to thank you.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.808
Anybody with our
weird blood type

02:21.891 --> 02:23.351
{\an3}would've done the
same thing.

02:23.434 --> 02:24.936
{\an3}I just hope you don't
have any, uh,

02:25.019 --> 02:26.437
{\an3}side effects,
you know?

02:26.521 --> 02:28.064
Mmm, what should I
be looking for?

02:28.147 --> 02:29.399
Hair growing on my back?

02:29.482 --> 02:31.067
{\an1}Hey, don't make her
laugh too much.

02:31.150 --> 02:33.194
She's still got stitches.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.700
{\an1}What's wrong?
It's okay.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.578
{\an3}It's nothing, I'm just venting
at poor Dr. Sturla here.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.621
{\an1}She's getting better,
isn't she?

02:43.705 --> 02:46.249
Oh, physically, yes,
I couldn't be happier.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.251
But mentally, well,

02:48.334 --> 02:50.420
I'm just not seeing the kind
of improvement that I'd like.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.755
It's my fault.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.925
I was so worried about helping
her get over her surgery

02:56.009 --> 02:59.095
and her gunshot, and I just
kept her so isolated.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.139
{\an3}There's no blame to be
placed, Mrs. Taylor.

03:01.222 --> 03:04.058
Kelly's first order of business
was to have a physical recovery.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.310
{\an3}Now that she's on
the right road,

03:05.393 --> 03:06.769
{\an3}we can concentrate
on her amnesia.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.439
{\an3}I'm gonna start her on
dopamine, novadrenaline--

03:09.522 --> 03:11.107
things that'll enhance
the chemical messengers

03:11.190 --> 03:13.109
{\an1}in the brain, but...
But

03:13.192 --> 03:14.777
there's no guarantee
that they'll work.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.779
When we're dealing with the
complexities of the brain,

03:16.863 --> 03:18.114
there are never any guarantees.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.324
{\an3}JACKIE:
There must

03:19.407 --> 03:20.909
be something we can do.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.744
Kelly's memories may come back
on their own,

03:22.827 --> 03:24.412
but it would be
really helpful

03:24.495 --> 03:25.955
{\an3}if you could surround her
with familiar faces,

03:26.039 --> 03:28.833
uh, people from her past,
things she loved.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.501
Anything that can
trigger memories.

03:30.585 --> 03:31.836
Yeah, we'll do
whatever it takes.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.297
(pager beeping)

03:34.380 --> 03:35.506
It's her best chance.

03:35.590 --> 03:36.966
Excuse me, I have

03:37.050 --> 03:38.134
to answer this page.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.096
It's so strange,

03:42.180 --> 03:44.307
the things that she can remember
and the things she can't.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.476
She remembers me.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.519
{\an3}Little things from
her childhood,

03:48.603 --> 03:50.480
but none of the big events.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.190
It's so hard to understand.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.650
{\an3}Yeah.
Oh, Brandon,

03:53.733 --> 03:57.403
it breaks my heart that
she doesn't remember you.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.618
{\an1}Not as much
as it breaks mine.

Where's Donna?

05:52.894 --> 05:54.437
{\an1}She couldn't get out
of her job appointment.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.480
{\an1}I'll fill her in.
All right.

05:55.563 --> 05:58.608
{\an3}Well, look who it is,
the working girl wannabe.

05:58.691 --> 05:59.650
{\an3}So any interviews
today, Val?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.277
Well at least I'm interviewing.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.737
What are you doing?

06:02.820 --> 06:04.405
{\an4}Is this gonna take long?
BRANDON:
No.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.948
I'll keep it short.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.533
All right,
as we all know, Kelly's

06:07.617 --> 06:09.327
{\an3}retrograde amnesia is sort
of in a holding pattern.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.411
Which basically means

06:10.495 --> 06:12.830
{\an3}she's lost the last couple
of years of her life.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.291
But she also has
what they call

06:15.375 --> 06:17.960
"antigrade amnesia,"
which means it's hard for her

06:18.044 --> 06:19.754
to even keep new information
in her head.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.130
{\an1}DAVID:
The doctor said

06:21.214 --> 06:22.465
that could get better
with time, though.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.384
Exactly. But to get at those
lost memories,

06:25.468 --> 06:27.845
the plan is to bombard her
with information

06:27.929 --> 06:29.806
from her past:
people, places,

06:29.889 --> 06:31.432
pictures, stories, everything.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.558
Everything?

06:34.352 --> 06:35.812
Yeah, everything.
If it's part of her past,

06:35.895 --> 06:37.814
I want her to have it:
the good, the bad,

06:37.897 --> 06:39.273
the disgusting.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.942
{\an3}I'm going to start
bombarding her this morning.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.276
{\an1}Well, then I'll
drop by afterwards

06:42.360 --> 06:44.278
{\an1}and come up with all
the wonderful memories I have.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.239
This is nothing
to joke about, Val.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.032
(whispers): Sorry.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.370
I'll call Donna
and, uh, find out

06:52.453 --> 06:53.246
when we can come by.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.831
STEVE:
Yeah, I'll head over after my

06:54.914 --> 06:56.666
important business
meeting on campus.

06:56.749 --> 06:57.959
{\an3}VALERIE:
Just can't seem

06:58.042 --> 07:00.169
to tear yourself away
from old C.U., huh?

07:00.253 --> 07:02.171
You are looking at one
of the hottest new sports agents

07:02.255 --> 07:03.631
to ever hit the boards.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.174
Yeah, like you have a chance
representing

07:05.258 --> 07:07.176
the C.U. women's
basketball team.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.970
{\an1}STEVE: Not the whole team,
Valerie, just the top

07:09.053 --> 07:11.389
three players.
(David clears throat)

07:11.472 --> 07:13.015
You guys want to let
Brandon finish?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.350
{\an3}BRANDON:
That's okay, I'm done.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.310
{\an5}(phone ringing)
Thanks for all your help, guys.
I appreciate it.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.020
{\an6}Okay.
Yeah, we're
there for you, man.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.105
Thanks.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.191
{\an1}Hello?

07:22.275 --> 07:23.818
{\an1}Uh, yeah, hold on
just a sec.

07:23.901 --> 07:26.195
A Mr. Grobecki
from Seattle...

07:26.279 --> 07:27.363
{\an1}<i>Seattle Times.</i>
Right.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.031
{\an3}It's a newspaper.
Yeah.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.117
Mr. Grobecki, how you doing?
Brandon Walsh.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.371
Really?

07:35.454 --> 07:37.915
The Metro desk?

07:37.999 --> 07:40.626
Yeah, yeah,
that would be fantastic. I...

07:42.628 --> 07:45.173
I can't really start
that quickly.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.674
You see, I...

07:46.757 --> 07:48.217
I got a little problem here.

07:48.301 --> 07:53.723
My girlfriend was shot
in a drive-by shooting and...

07:53.806 --> 07:55.808
No, no, she's gonna be fine.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.562
Listen, do you think
you could do me a favor

07:59.645 --> 08:02.732
and maybe hold the job
open for a week?

08:02.815 --> 08:04.233
You could?

08:04.317 --> 08:05.902
You know what?
That would be fantastic.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.862
I will let you know
within the week.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.238
Thank you, sir.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.324
Bye-bye.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.332
{\an5}I'll take this
for you. Thanks.
Oh, okay.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.418
Breakfast man.

08:22.501 --> 08:24.545
You can just leave it there.
I'm not hungry.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.423
Now, you got to eat if you want
to get that youthful,

08:27.506 --> 08:28.591
healthy glow back.

08:28.674 --> 08:29.800
Noah.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.094
How're you feeling?

08:32.178 --> 08:33.929
Much better. I think.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.599
I'm ready to get out of here
and go home, though,

08:36.682 --> 08:37.767
wherever that is.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.101
You're not gonna be able to

08:39.184 --> 08:40.269
unless you get
your strength back.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.270
I'm serious

08:41.354 --> 08:42.270
about that eating thing.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.272
It's the only way.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.316
These are for you.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.276
They're beautiful.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.486
Thank you.

08:48.569 --> 08:49.695
Yeah, I spared no expense.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.530
I picked 'em at the peak
of freshness.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.325
I got some other
goodies for you.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.327
Yeah?

08:56.410 --> 08:57.411
What's this?

08:57.495 --> 08:58.955
{\an1}Um, I didn't
know what kind

08:59.038 --> 09:00.289
of music you liked,
so I got you

09:00.373 --> 09:02.458
a little of this,
a little of that.

09:02.541 --> 09:05.378
I don't even remember
what kind of music I liked.

09:05.461 --> 09:08.005
{\an4}How can you forget
something like that?
Don't worry about it.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.507
I mean, you'll listen
to it and, uh...

09:09.590 --> 09:11.259
it'll come back to you
like that. (snaps fingers)

09:12.426 --> 09:13.469
I gotta go.

09:13.552 --> 09:15.137
So soon?

09:15.221 --> 09:16.681
Yeah, but I'll be back later.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.140
I'll stay longer.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.475
Winston.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.477
Noah, can you
do me a favor?

09:21.560 --> 09:23.312
When you come back,
can you bring Winston?

09:24.355 --> 09:26.148
My mom will know.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.817
You got it.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.703
(knocking)

09:40.538 --> 09:42.623
I don't have time.
Donna, come on in.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.501
Look, let's just deal with this
at the meeting, all right?

09:45.584 --> 09:46.419
(barks)

09:46.502 --> 09:48.462
Goliath, quiet, baby.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.298
Don't let it throw you;
I thrive on chaos.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.258
Oh, I can handle
it, Mrs. Schulze.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.468
{\an3}Um, did you decide what you
want me to get you yet?

09:54.552 --> 09:55.886
{\an1}Yes. I want
something like this

09:55.970 --> 09:57.471
or these; we'll do
the fittings here.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.473
I don't have time to go
from one damn shop

09:59.557 --> 10:01.225
{\an1}to another.
That's what you have me for.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.518
And I cannot tell you

10:02.601 --> 10:04.312
how grateful I am that...
(phone ringing)

10:04.395 --> 10:06.063
What now?
Excuse me.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.523
Yes?

10:07.606 --> 10:09.233
Yes, this is she.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.152
Appointment?

10:11.235 --> 10:12.570
(gasps):
Oh, my God!

10:12.653 --> 10:14.196
I completely forgot.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.865
No, yes. Yes.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.033
He'll be there.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.535
{\an1}Okay. Bye.

10:19.618 --> 10:20.870
Is there a problem?

10:20.953 --> 10:22.163
Where is my head?

10:22.246 --> 10:23.039
The vet-- Goliath
was supposed

10:23.122 --> 10:23.956
to be there for his
shots and grooming

10:24.040 --> 10:26.417
{\an1}this morning--
slipped my mind completely.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.503
Well, if you're all booked up,
I could take him over there.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.381
That would be such a lifesaver.
I'll pay you for it, of course.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.383
I hope it won't be
too much out of your way.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.886
{\an1}No problem.
Thank you so much.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.054
Goliath, baby, come on.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.389
Bye-bye time.
(smacks lips)

10:40.473 --> 10:43.100
(panting)

10:46.354 --> 10:49.190
(indistinct chatter)

10:52.485 --> 10:53.527
{\an1}Good shot.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.570
Take it to the hoop.

10:54.653 --> 10:57.073
{\an1}I'm open!

10:58.115 --> 10:59.367
{\an1}Shot!

11:00.785 --> 11:02.745
Yes, all right!

11:03.954 --> 11:05.331
{\an3}Steve!
Hey!

11:05.414 --> 11:07.416
{\an6}I didn't think you were
going to show.
You kidding?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.959
Miss an opportunity
of a lifetime?

11:09.043 --> 11:10.586
{\an3}What might that be?
You.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.546
When you're voted
Rookie of the Year in the WNBA,

11:12.630 --> 11:15.383
you're going to look right
into those cameras and say,

11:15.466 --> 11:17.426
"I owe it all to Steve Sanders,
who believed in me

11:17.510 --> 11:19.303
when I was an underrated
player at C.U."

11:19.387 --> 11:22.264
To say nothing of practicing

11:22.348 --> 11:25.267
six hours a day for the last,
oh, God, nine years...

11:25.351 --> 11:27.603
Well, there is that, too.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.605
{\an3}What's this?
What do you think--

11:29.688 --> 11:31.273
Karl Malone's the only Mailman?

11:31.357 --> 11:32.775
Steve Sanders delivers, too.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.777
The tickets!

11:34.860 --> 11:36.904
{\an6}Oh, my God,
you got the tickets!
Hey!

11:36.987 --> 11:38.447
What'd I tell you?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.740
They told me
the Chemical Brothers concert

11:39.824 --> 11:40.783
was sold out for weeks.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.078
Well, look, you stick
with me after you graduate

11:44.161 --> 11:45.413
I'll deliver for you.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.623
Steve, you're the greatest.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.291
I know.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.043
Tell your friends.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.799
DONNA: Kel, it's been like this
all morning.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.301
Can you believe she has me
taking her dog to the vet?

11:59.385 --> 12:00.970
Yeah, I know. Hold on.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.888
(panting)
What?

12:02.972 --> 12:05.141
No, I can still make it
to the hospital.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.810
Probably like around noonish.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.812
Okay.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.647
Noah what?

12:11.730 --> 12:13.232
He gave you that?

12:13.315 --> 12:14.066
That's sweet.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.277
Well, I wish I knew him
better myself.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.194
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

12:17.278 --> 12:18.237
(beeping)

12:18.320 --> 12:20.197
Oh, shoot, I have another call.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.949
Can you hang on a second?

12:22.032 --> 12:23.492
Okay, I'll just
see you at noon.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.119
Okay, bye.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.037
Hello.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.372
Oh, hi, Mrs. Schulze.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.957
What?

12:30.040 --> 12:32.126
Shoes for which outfit,
the gray or the blue?

12:32.209 --> 12:33.127
(grunts)

12:33.210 --> 12:34.211
The blue suit?

12:34.295 --> 12:35.212
Okay, hold on.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.672
No, no, not you, Goliath.

12:36.755 --> 12:37.882
He what?

12:37.965 --> 12:39.717
No, you did not mention
he hates the vet.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.469
But...
(barks)

12:41.552 --> 12:44.555
Oh, boy, got to go.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.182
Goliath! Stop! Wait!

12:46.265 --> 12:48.142
Good dog. Heel!

12:49.143 --> 12:50.269
KELLY:
<i>Listen, Brandon,</i>

12:50.352 --> 12:53.230
{\an1}I don't want you
to think about

12:53.314 --> 12:56.108
{\an1}giving up that job offer in
Seattle on my account.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.362
{\an3}Well, it's not just
on your account, Kel,

13:00.446 --> 13:03.365
{\an1}it's... it's on
<i>our</i> account.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.409
I mean...

13:05.493 --> 13:08.412
{\an3}I know you don't remember
anything right now,

13:08.496 --> 13:10.664
but when you do,

13:10.748 --> 13:12.791
{\an3}I don't want to be
a thousand miles away.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.591
{\an1}Let's just look at the rest
of the pictures, okay?

13:22.092 --> 13:23.844
Okay.

13:23.928 --> 13:24.845
This is us.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.222
You and me.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.390
Yeah.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.975
I know.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.644
{\an1}Donna and David.
Mm-hmm.

13:32.728 --> 13:34.355
Uh, Steve and Valerie.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.065
{\an3}Kel, do you remember
any of this?

13:36.148 --> 13:38.734
No. Nothing.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.154
I don't remember Hawaii.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.575
I barely remember today.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.494
Hey, folks.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.912
{\an1}BRANDON:
Hey, Detective.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.413
How's our patient

13:51.497 --> 13:53.415
{\an1}doing this morning?
Much better.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.751
{\an4}But I'm starting to feel
like I'm the one in jail.
Yeah, well

13:55.834 --> 13:56.877
I hope they let you out soon.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.088
We could use your I.D.
to help put that creep away.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.382
{\an1}I thought Brandon
already identified him.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.551
True, but, um,
we have a little problem.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.803
{\an3}How could there
be a problem?

14:05.886 --> 14:08.305
{\an3}I ID'd the guy
from the lineup.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.557
He's the guy,
no question.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.767
Yeah, that's the problem.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.936
See, the lab results came back.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.938
No gunshot residue
on his hands.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.065
{\an3}So what we'd like you
to do, Mr. Walsh,

14:18.148 --> 14:20.025
is come on back down
to the station.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.903
{\an3}Look at a few other pictures,
and as soon as you're

14:22.987 --> 14:24.071
ready, young lady...

14:24.154 --> 14:25.239
I'll be there.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.324
Good.

14:31.912 --> 14:35.291
Can you, um,
just leave the pictures?

14:35.374 --> 14:37.084
Yeah, sure.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.379
I'll see you later.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.822
(gasps)
Whoa.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.866
Easy there, big fella.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.702
{\an4}It's just my
animal magnetism.
Oh.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.329
(laughs):
Hey!

15:13.412 --> 15:14.663
Hey, somebody's
in a good mood.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.831
Yeah, that would be me.

15:15.914 --> 15:17.124
Yeah, you finally
win the lottery?

15:17.207 --> 15:18.667
Better, I'm on the verge

15:18.751 --> 15:19.877
of a whole new career.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.629
Steve Sanders, sports agent.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.131
{\an3}I need a number
four for table five

15:24.214 --> 15:25.674
{\an3}and two threes
for the back deuce.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.675
{\an3}Okay.
Whew, it's a good thing

15:26.759 --> 15:28.677
I took all that math in school.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.845
What's with the toothy grin?

15:29.928 --> 15:31.805
I'm celebrating.

15:31.889 --> 15:32.514
You care to join me?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.308
Why don't you get
that, uh,

15:34.391 --> 15:35.643
Charlotte Campbell to help you?

15:35.726 --> 15:38.979
Charlotte Campbell
is not my girlfriend.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.357
Well, that's a smart move,
'cause, how do you say?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.233
She's out of your league?

15:43.317 --> 15:45.527
What do I have to do to get you
to go out with me?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.946
Um... be somebody else?

15:49.073 --> 15:50.324
NAT:
Keep working it, pal.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.867
She's warming up to you.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.410
Oh, I'll melt her eventually.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.370
{\an1}Hey, Nat,
this real-life

15:54.453 --> 15:56.664
stuff isn't any more
difficult than school.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.290
I've got a big

15:58.374 --> 15:59.541
meeting with Drew Zaleski.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.710
Zaleski, the big deal
sports agent?

16:01.794 --> 16:02.461
The very one.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.004
And when I tell
him I've landed

16:04.088 --> 16:06.256
Charlotte Campbell,
I'm in, big time.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.222
You're sure you don't
need this for a while?

16:13.305 --> 16:14.890
{\an3}Mine just
committed suicide.

16:14.973 --> 16:17.226
No, go ahead.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.228
Grab yourself a beer.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.313
{\an3}You'll have to put
it on my tab.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.650
Yeah, like you'll ever
need a tab with me.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.696
{\an3}Business still off?
(sighs)

16:28.779 --> 16:30.698
Yeah. I don't know,
school's back.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.658
I just, I can't seem
to bring 'em in.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.203
It's so frustrating.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.913
Maybe I need some
new bands or something.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.540
You should get some.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.375
That's the problem.
I can't find any.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.585
{\an3}It's like this town's
all dried up or something.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.629
When you and Valerie
were partners,

16:45.713 --> 16:47.840
she didn't get involved in that
side of the business?

16:49.675 --> 16:52.386
No, music was always
my department.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.887
Tell me about her.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.765
Who, Valerie?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.767
I can tell you in one word:
sex and money.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.102
That's two.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.020
{\an1}Not where
Valerie's concerned.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.772
Dude, if you don't have dough,
forget it.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.232
Val's out

17:05.315 --> 17:07.608
{\an1}for money, for stocks,
bonds, property.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.319
{\an1}She'll take cash,
check, credit card...

17:10.404 --> 17:13.115
But when it came to squeezing
every nickel out of this club,

17:13.198 --> 17:15.200
she knew what she was doing.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.328
You and I should go hunting.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.704
Hunting?

17:19.788 --> 17:20.789
Band hunting. Um...

17:20.873 --> 17:22.624
I know a few
out of the way places.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.667
Sounds good.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.628
Hey, you know somebody
named Winston?

17:27.713 --> 17:28.964
{\an3}Kelly wants me
to bring him back.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.133
{\an3}I have no idea who
this guy is, it's...

17:31.216 --> 17:32.468
{\an5}(door opens)
DONNA:
David.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.635
I'm so dead.
My life is over.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.471
You're not going to believe
what just happened to me.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.139
Donna, relax.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.683
Okay, what happened?

17:39.767 --> 17:43.270
Okay, you know Jane Schulze,
the woman I'm shopping for?

17:43.353 --> 17:44.271
I lost Goliath.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.482
Who's... who's Goliath?

17:46.565 --> 17:47.649
Her dog.

17:47.733 --> 17:48.817
You took her dog shopping?

17:48.901 --> 17:49.818
No, to the vet.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.153
See, Jane had an appointment.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.529
She couldn't take him
to the vet, so I said

17:52.613 --> 17:53.655
I would take him to the vet.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.615
I didn't know
he hates vets.

17:54.698 --> 17:55.949
So we get to the vet,

17:56.033 --> 17:57.326
the dog takes off, he bolts.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.285
I can't find him anywhere

17:58.368 --> 18:00.078
and now Jane expects me
to have him back.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.288
Okay, here's what

18:01.371 --> 18:02.831
you need to do:
you need to call Jane

18:02.915 --> 18:04.666
and tell her that
there was a mix-up

18:04.750 --> 18:06.752
at the vet and they're
keeping Goliath overnight,

18:06.835 --> 18:07.669
{\an1}and you'll have him
back to her tomorrow.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.837
Sounds like a plan.

18:08.921 --> 18:09.880
{\an3}DONNA:
Well, how am I

18:09.963 --> 18:11.173
supposed to have him
back to her

18:11.256 --> 18:12.299
tomorrow when I can't find him?

18:12.382 --> 18:14.843
We're just gonna have
to get started.

18:14.927 --> 18:18.263
{\an3}I'd love to help you
guys, but I can't. I...

18:18.347 --> 18:20.390
Don't worry about it.
How hard can this be?

18:20.474 --> 18:21.934
(sighs)

18:23.268 --> 18:24.478
Good morning.

18:24.561 --> 18:25.729
{\an4}KELLY:
Hey.
Hey.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.523
Well, what is all that?

18:27.606 --> 18:29.399
{\an3}Your college and high
school yearbooks.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.568
I thought we could take
a trip down memory lane.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.320
Valerie, that's so sweet.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.988
Anything I can do to help.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.534
It's so weird.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.202
I mean, I know that

18:40.285 --> 18:42.704
we all went to high school
and college together,

18:42.788 --> 18:45.541
but I feel like I'm meeting
you all for the first time.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.710
Well, actually, um,
I just met you in college.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.587
I wasn't part
of the high school crowd.

18:50.671 --> 18:51.880
That was just you, Donna,

18:51.964 --> 18:54.842
David, Steve
and Brandon.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.719
By the way, um,
has Brandon come by?

18:57.803 --> 18:59.721
Yeah.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.098
Yeah, he's being really sweet.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.016
Yeah, that he is.

19:04.434 --> 19:07.729
So are you starting
to feel anything

19:07.813 --> 19:09.231
{\an3}for him?

19:10.440 --> 19:13.151
You mean, do I remember that
we were in love?

19:14.611 --> 19:16.822
No.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.618
Listen, Kelly...

19:24.163 --> 19:26.748
People are gonna
tell you things

19:26.832 --> 19:28.417
{\an3}about your relationship
with Brandon,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.502
but, you know,
you shouldn't...

19:32.504 --> 19:34.256
Just don't believe
everything you hear.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.092
I mean, you and Brandon
were, were really close

19:37.175 --> 19:38.594
and you were very involved.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.888
But you had other
involvements, too.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.599
I mean, that ring, it...

19:43.682 --> 19:45.601
it wasn't on your finger,
was it?

19:47.686 --> 19:49.229
No, no.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.397
It was like this.

19:50.480 --> 19:54.776
Look, all I'm saying is just
don't drive yourself crazy

19:54.860 --> 19:57.696
trying to remember something
that may not have been there.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.952
Where is Noah in here?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.412
I can't find him.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.623
Oh, that's because you just
met him in Hawaii.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.999
Really?

20:10.667 --> 20:12.628
That's so weird.
I mean, out of everybody,

20:12.711 --> 20:13.712
I feel like I know him the best.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.756
{\an1}Really?
Yeah.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.633
So what do you know about him?

20:17.716 --> 20:18.967
What do you want to know?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.594
Everything.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.429
Who is he?
Where does he come from?

20:25.724 --> 20:28.518
Uh, Kelly...

20:28.602 --> 20:31.438
You know, before you get
too interested in Noah,

20:31.521 --> 20:33.440
I think maybe
he might have somebody.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.734
Brandon said he wasn't
involved with anybody.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.527
{\an1}And he said that you
weren't interested in him.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.528
He did?

20:38.612 --> 20:39.237
Mm-hmm.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.490
You know, the truth is, Kelly,

20:41.573 --> 20:43.617
I just think
you can do much better.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.243
Will you do me a favor?

20:45.327 --> 20:46.620
Will you find out

20:46.703 --> 20:48.664
if he does
have somebody else?

20:48.747 --> 20:51.166
I'll do my best.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.085
Great. Thanks.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.725
{\an3}Mr. Zaleski,
thrilled to meet you.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.559
I'm Steve Sanders.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.020
I'm glad you could
make it, Steve.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.271
Are you kidding?

21:13.355 --> 21:14.690
Pass up an opportunity

21:14.773 --> 21:16.024
{\an3}to meet a legendary
sports agent

21:16.108 --> 21:17.192
like you? Come on.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.861
It's a little thick,
but thanks.

21:21.655 --> 21:22.656
Whoo!
So...

21:22.739 --> 21:24.992
{\an5}you'd like to join
my agency, huh?
Oh, yeah.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.535
You guys are the best
in the business.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.537
Why aim low when I can shoot
for number one?

21:28.620 --> 21:31.289
And you know why
we're number one?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.502
Well, the way I see it,

21:35.585 --> 21:38.213
the sports business
is a lot like biology.

21:38.296 --> 21:39.548
{\an3}You either
grow or die.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.383
If you're gonna
stay number one,

21:41.466 --> 21:43.844
you've got to learn to expand
into things like women's sports.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.512
{\an3}Title IX's going
to make sure

21:45.595 --> 21:47.889
{\an3}it gets bigger and
bigger, and the WNBA

21:47.973 --> 21:49.307
is already running away
with itself,

21:49.391 --> 21:50.726
so things are a lock.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.227
And I just happen
to have a bead

21:52.310 --> 21:54.229
on a future number one
right now.

21:54.312 --> 21:55.772
Really?

21:55.856 --> 21:57.399
Yeah, Charlotte Campbell.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.067
I've seen her play
in this gym.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.527
Deadly in the paint,

22:00.610 --> 22:03.405
second leading scorer
in the W.C. Central.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.994
She's great and she's mine.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.579
{\an3}In the bag.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.081
And I'm also talking to some
of her teammates and some guys

22:13.165 --> 22:14.583
I know through KEG.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.753
Look, Steve, you're a nice,
well-meaning guy,

22:17.836 --> 22:21.631
so I'm gonna do you a big favor
and be totally candid with you.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.258
Well, thanks,
I'd appreciate that.

22:23.341 --> 22:24.885
Yeah, well, we'll see.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.344
The only reason

22:26.428 --> 22:28.055
I'm meeting with you today is
because of your father.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.264
You know my dad?

22:29.347 --> 22:30.432
{\an1}Oh, yeah.

22:30.515 --> 22:31.767
I've done a lot of business
with Rush.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.060
He's my kind of deal maker.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.311
Since you're his son,

22:34.394 --> 22:35.604
{\an1}I'm gonna be straight
with you.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.231
I believe these are yours.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.316
Where'd you get these?!

22:39.399 --> 22:40.734
{\an1}I gave these to Charlotte.
No!

22:40.817 --> 22:41.777
You didn't.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.779
And if anyone so much
as suspects that you did,

22:43.862 --> 22:45.614
you deny it
till your face turns blue.

22:45.697 --> 22:46.948
{\an1}Do you know what
the penalty is

22:47.032 --> 22:48.950
for a college athlete who
accepts gifts from alumni?

22:49.034 --> 22:50.994
Automatic suspension.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.954
{\an1}Charlotte Campbell
probably has a future,

22:53.038 --> 22:54.623
and you damn near ended it
with those tickets.

22:54.706 --> 22:55.457
And the same thing goes

22:55.540 --> 22:57.584
{\an1}for any other C.U.
athlete you go near.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.794
You understand?

22:58.877 --> 23:00.962
How did you get these tickets?

23:01.046 --> 23:02.631
It's my job.

23:02.714 --> 23:03.548
For your father's sake,

23:03.632 --> 23:05.884
{\an1}I'm giving you
a life's lesson here, Steve.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.594
Don't put on the cowboy hat

23:07.677 --> 23:09.304
unless you got
the cattle to prove it.

23:21.024 --> 23:24.486
In mocha? You know, I don't see
any silk in mocha.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.279
{\an1}Uh, sweetie, you're looking
in the wrong section.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.365
{\an1}These are the cheapies.
Cheapies?

23:28.448 --> 23:30.492
No, Mrs. Schulze,
I wasn't talking to you.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.160
Actually, can I call you
right back? Thanks.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.287
{\an1}Let's see. You know what?
You need to be

23:34.371 --> 23:35.664
{\an1}looking over in
that section.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.667
{\an1}Uh, Val?
Yeah?

23:38.750 --> 23:40.001
What are you
doing here?

23:40.085 --> 23:41.670
Oh, job interview.
But you know what?

23:41.753 --> 23:43.880
{\an6}I don't think
retail's in my blood.
Hmm.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.007
So, are you doing that
personal shopping thing?

23:46.091 --> 23:47.008
Mm-hmm.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.468
(phone rings)
Oh, hold on.

23:48.552 --> 23:49.511
Hello.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.471
Hi, Mrs. Freiberg!

23:51.555 --> 23:53.306
Yes, I'm at Paris Bluff
right now.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.850
I just found you
two perfect outfits.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.686
I was thinking I could meet you
around 3:00. Great.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.146
(beeping)
Oh, I have call waiting.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.522
Can you hold on? Thanks.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.983
Hello. Hi, Mrs. Musgrave.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.359
Yes, I'm here at Paris Bluff.

24:04.442 --> 24:06.194
{\an1}I was thinking
I could meet you

24:06.278 --> 24:07.362
{\an1}at Gucci
around 5:00.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.531
You can't do that?

24:09.614 --> 24:11.074
{\an1}Um, can you hold
on a second?

24:11.158 --> 24:12.701
Okay.

24:16.621 --> 24:17.539
How's 6:00?

24:17.622 --> 24:20.041
I-I just have to visit a friend
at the hospital.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.376
I can switch them.

24:21.459 --> 24:25.338
Okay. Ooh, um, could you hold on
a second? Thanks.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.215
Mrs. Freiberg, I am so sorry,

24:27.299 --> 24:30.093
but can you hold on
one more second? Thank you.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.012
Hello, Mrs. Musgrave?

24:32.095 --> 24:33.013
(dial tone)

24:33.096 --> 24:35.056
Mrs. Freiberg, hi.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.558
(dial tone)

24:36.641 --> 24:38.727
Ah... ha.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.229
I just lost them both.
Great.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.231
{\an3}You know,
I have to say,

24:43.315 --> 24:44.065
I like the brown one.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.400
Better than the black?

24:45.483 --> 24:47.027
Well, it depends
on who it's for.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.070
Well, it's for Mrs. Freiberg.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.614
Or is that Mrs. Musgrave?

24:50.697 --> 24:53.700
I don't know. One of them was
canceling on me.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.953
All right, hold this.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.414
Redial.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.252
Hi, Mrs. Musgrave?

25:04.336 --> 25:06.588
Yes, this is Donna Martin's
associate, Valerie Malone.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.757
{\an3}Uh, yeah, we're not gonna
be able to move

25:08.840 --> 25:09.925
{\an3}this afternoon's
appointment.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.760
{\an3}Um, will tomorrow
be okay?

25:11.843 --> 25:13.929
Great, great. Yeah.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.764
We'll, uh, we'll call
you later to confirm.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.599
Okay, thanks.

25:17.682 --> 25:18.600
{\an3}(chuckles)

25:18.683 --> 25:20.101
{\an3}Thank you.
Yeah.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.145
How are you
at finding lost dogs?

25:25.190 --> 25:26.107
(high voice):
Teddy-gram

25:26.191 --> 25:28.944
{\an1}for Miss Kelly Taylor.
Teddy-gram.

25:29.027 --> 25:29.945
Winston.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.196
You got him!

25:31.279 --> 25:34.115
If you knew what I had to go
through to get this bag of rags.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.618
{\an3}Oh, thank you.
Winston!

25:36.701 --> 25:37.994
How about a hug for me?

25:38.078 --> 25:39.829
Do I know you well enough?

25:39.913 --> 25:42.457
Well, considering your memory--
or, uh, lack thereof--

25:42.540 --> 25:44.292
{\an1}I'd say you know me
about as well

25:44.376 --> 25:45.919
as anybody else right now.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.755
It's good to see someone else
who can laugh about amnesia.

25:48.838 --> 25:49.798
Personally,

25:49.881 --> 25:53.218
I think that most memories are
vastly overrated.

25:53.301 --> 25:55.220
{\an1}STURLA:
Oh, excuse me.

25:55.303 --> 25:56.346
You wanted to see me, Kelly?

25:56.429 --> 25:59.474
Yes. Doctor, I'm going
stir crazy here.

25:59.557 --> 26:02.769
Look, Kelly, your physical
therapy is going very well, but

26:02.852 --> 26:04.771
the amnesia is something we're
gonna have to monitor here.

26:04.854 --> 26:06.273
You're not letting me out,
are you?

26:06.356 --> 26:08.275
Not quite yet.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.068
I know it seems like it,
but it's not a jail.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.903
{\an1}You don't have to stay
in your room.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.113
You can walk around the hospital
all you want.

26:13.196 --> 26:14.823
Oh, that sounds like fun.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.116
{\an1}Hey, Doc,

26:16.199 --> 26:17.659
it's none of my business,
but, uh,

26:17.742 --> 26:18.994
you said Kelly was okay
physically.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.078
{\an1}Right?

26:20.161 --> 26:22.330
{\an1}Well, considering the severity
of her injuries, yes.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.498
How about an outing?

26:23.581 --> 26:26.126
Like a day trip,
off the grounds.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.169
Maybe for a little while,
only if there's someone there,

26:28.253 --> 26:30.088
just in case there's a problem.

26:30.171 --> 26:31.506
Care to be my chaperone?

26:31.589 --> 26:32.632
I would love to.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.050
Uh, let's hurry up.
Get your things.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.010
I'll wait for you out front,
okay?

26:35.093 --> 26:37.137
Okay.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.513
{\an1}Thanks, Doc.
Sure.

26:38.596 --> 26:39.848
Thank you.

26:39.931 --> 26:43.351
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

26:53.445 --> 26:55.488
{\an4}RUSH:
You know, you probably won't
understand this for a while,

26:55.572 --> 26:58.742
but, uh, Drew Zaleski
did you a great favor.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.536
{\an3}Oh, yeah, I plan on being
eternally grateful.

27:01.619 --> 27:04.372
{\an3}Remind me to send him
a thank-you card in 50 years.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.499
{\an1}(sighs): You know, sooner
or later, my son,

27:06.583 --> 27:08.668
you're gonna realize that
life is not like school.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.379
In school you screw up,
maybe you flunk a class.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.299
In life, you screw up, the
consequences can be brutal.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.509
I'm not talking about succeeding
or failing, either.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.387
I'm talking about keeping a roof
over your head,

27:19.471 --> 27:20.388
food in your stomach.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.848
{\an1}And when you have
a family...

27:21.931 --> 27:23.516
I know, I know!
I'm a screw-up!

27:23.600 --> 27:25.226
{\an3}Look, you've been
telling me that

27:25.310 --> 27:26.603
for the last 20 years.
You know what?

27:26.686 --> 27:27.979
You're right.
I am a screw-up.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.230
Is that what you wanted to hear?

27:29.314 --> 27:32.609
You really think I get a joy
out of you talking like that?

27:32.692 --> 27:34.235
All I ever wanted

27:34.319 --> 27:35.904
was for you
to make something of yourself.

27:35.987 --> 27:39.407
I know, because this "myself"
isn't quite good enough for you.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.743
Is that what you're
trying to say, Dad?

27:41.826 --> 27:42.786
No.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.871
What I'm saying is

27:44.954 --> 27:48.291
that maybe some of this is
my fault, too.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.919
{\an1}That's why I want
to help you. Look...

27:51.002 --> 27:51.878
I've been doing some thinking.

27:51.961 --> 27:53.963
Maybe what you need is something
of your own.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.966
{\an1}A business that
you can control completely,

27:57.050 --> 27:59.094
be totally responsible for,
that you can build,

27:59.177 --> 28:00.887
that you can take pride in.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.389
Something I can screw up.

28:02.472 --> 28:05.934
No, this time you have no choice
but to succeed.

28:06.017 --> 28:09.229
And what exactly is this
business venture?

28:09.312 --> 28:10.772
You remember that little
newspaper that I own?

28:10.855 --> 28:12.315
That Beverly Hills gossip rag?

28:12.399 --> 28:13.733
Well, not anymore.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.777
{\an1}I fired the incompetents
I had running it.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.237
It's defunct now.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.822
It's a bare-bones operation.

28:18.905 --> 28:21.074
What do I know
about running a newspaper?

28:21.157 --> 28:24.244
Well, I hope to hell a lot more
than those idiots I fired did.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.831
Son, it's not
the <i> Washington Post,</i>

28:27.914 --> 28:30.667
{\an1}but it does need
a publisher.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.585
I'm giving you
a big opportunity here.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.963
Don't blow it.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.424
Come on upstairs. I'll show you
the facility.

28:37.507 --> 28:41.594
Ooh, I'm shaking
with anticipation.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.309
Valerie?

28:48.393 --> 28:50.061
{\an3}Your partner?
Mm-hmm.

28:50.145 --> 28:50.979
Are you nuts?

28:51.062 --> 28:52.272
I need the help.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.315
Donna, this is Valerie, the one
where when you shake her hand,

28:54.399 --> 28:56.317
you gotta check and make sure
your fingers aren't missing.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.318
{\an1}(laughs)

28:57.402 --> 28:59.446
{\an1}Look, I know this
sounds crazy,

28:59.529 --> 29:00.697
{\an1}but she's extremely
well-organized

29:00.780 --> 29:02.157
and she has good taste.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.451
{\an1}And to be honest,
I can't handle

29:04.534 --> 29:06.327
{\an1}all the new clients
Mrs. Schulze's throwing at me.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.204
Well, that'll be over soon.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.623
Oh, that's funny.
No, you know what? You're right.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.168
{\an1}If we don't find Goliath,
I won't need Valerie's help.

29:13.251 --> 29:16.337
I'll need a good place
in the unemployment line.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.298
(sighs)

29:18.381 --> 29:19.174
This dog is gone.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.426
I might as well just go
and tell her.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.761
Who, Valerie?

29:23.845 --> 29:26.014
No, Jane Schulze!

29:26.097 --> 29:28.349
{\an1}(sighs)

29:28.433 --> 29:31.644
You know what? I'm just gonna go
over there and tell her

29:31.728 --> 29:35.648
how incompetent I am, apologize,
and offer to pay her.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.025
Pay her?

29:37.108 --> 29:38.443
Mm-hmm.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.028
For the love of her life?
Donna, how do you do that?

29:40.111 --> 29:42.405
(groans)

29:42.489 --> 29:44.407
Don't worry. We'll find the dog.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.494
I wish I could believe you.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.375
BRANDON: Steve,
the <i> Beverly Hills Shopper?</i>

29:54.459 --> 29:55.376
{\an1}It's an eight-page
handout.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.378
{\an1}People use this rag
to line their bird cages.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.379
{\an1}What's the
matter with you?

29:58.463 --> 29:59.547
Forget about <i> The Shopper.</i>

29:59.631 --> 30:00.924
{\an3}It's gone.
It's history.

30:01.007 --> 30:02.550
{\an3}It's whatever we want
to do with it.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.886
{\an3}We can make any kind
of paper we want.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.387
{\an1}What do you mean "we,"
white man?

30:06.471 --> 30:09.724
{\an3}We, us, you, me,
partners, together.

30:09.807 --> 30:12.310
{\an3}I'll be the publisher,
you be the editor-in-chief.

30:12.393 --> 30:14.521
{\an3}We'll split
everything 50-50.

30:14.604 --> 30:15.855
Mm...

30:15.939 --> 30:18.608
Just take a look.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.406
(laughs)

30:25.490 --> 30:26.407
Yeah!

30:26.491 --> 30:29.577
BRANDON:
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.746
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

30:31.829 --> 30:33.206
Good-bye.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.416
{\an3}Ah, wait! Don't be too hasty.
Think about it, Brandon.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.752
{\an3}This place is filled
with opportunity.

30:37.835 --> 30:38.962
A little paint,

30:39.045 --> 30:40.755
a little creativity,
a little imagination.

30:40.838 --> 30:41.756
A little insanity.

30:41.839 --> 30:43.466
Come on, Steve, let's go.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.260
So you'll think about it?

30:45.343 --> 30:46.719
Okay, I'll think about it.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.055
No.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.890
Brandon, come on!

30:50.974 --> 30:53.434
We could really make something
out of this newspaper.

30:53.518 --> 30:56.104
{\an3}It'll be our
own newspaper.

30:56.187 --> 31:00.108
An underground newspaper.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.568
We could make a fortune.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.903
With what, Steve?

31:03.987 --> 31:06.072
With what?
There's nothing here.

31:06.155 --> 31:07.740
You can't make something
out of nothing.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.785
In order to have a newspaper,
you need, you need employees,

31:10.868 --> 31:13.246
{\an1}you need, you need
hardworking, talented people.

31:13.329 --> 31:14.831
You need writers, you need,

31:14.914 --> 31:16.332
{\an1}you need advertising
salespeople,

31:16.416 --> 31:18.334
{\an1}you need, you need
art directors,

31:18.418 --> 31:19.669
{\an1}you need computer
layout people,

31:19.752 --> 31:20.962
you need equipment,
you need printers,

31:21.045 --> 31:22.088
you need distributors.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.591
Not to mention you need salaries
to pay all these people.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.218
Yes, yes, there's all those
things, but Brandon,

31:27.302 --> 31:30.013
I've been thinking,
and well, there's you.

31:30.096 --> 31:31.055
{\an3}(laughs)

31:31.139 --> 31:32.140
There's you,

31:32.223 --> 31:33.808
there's me, there's David.

31:33.891 --> 31:36.978
He could do the, uh, the music
and club reviews, movie stuff,

31:37.061 --> 31:37.979
things like that.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.982
{\an3}Donna, she could
do fashion.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.276
Me, I'll hammer out the sports.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.486
{\an3}You just have to
tie it all together.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.864
{\an3}After you spell-check my work,
of course. What do you say?

31:47.947 --> 31:49.657
And what do we live on
in the meantime, Steve?

31:49.741 --> 31:52.327
Well,<i> The Shopper</i> still has
about 60 grand

31:52.410 --> 31:53.161
in accounts receivable.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.704
{\an3}My old man said that
we could use that

31:54.787 --> 31:57.165
{\an3}to get this puppy
up on its feet.

31:57.248 --> 32:01.836
{\an3}Brandon, once we start turning
a profit, it's all ours.

32:01.919 --> 32:03.338
{\an3}All of it!

32:03.421 --> 32:05.173
What do you say, Brandon?

32:05.256 --> 32:08.176
This could be a cash cow.

32:09.594 --> 32:10.803
{\an3}Come on.

32:10.887 --> 32:11.804
(sighs)

32:11.888 --> 32:12.972
Come on, man.

32:13.056 --> 32:17.518
Steve, you know
I love you, bro.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.145
I can't do it.

32:28.446 --> 32:30.573
{\an1}We should
turn back soon.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.700
{\an3}Just a little bit
further, okay?

32:32.784 --> 32:34.202
All right-- I don't want

32:34.285 --> 32:35.703
{\an1}to tire you out
too much, though.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.704
No, I'm fine.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.540
This is exactly
what I needed.

32:39.624 --> 32:40.375
Thank you.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.377
You're welcome.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.545
{\an3}I told the guy in charge
that we'd turn back

32:44.629 --> 32:45.380
in five minutes, okay?

32:45.463 --> 32:47.382
You're worse than Sturla.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.550
{\an3}Oh!
(chuckles)

32:49.634 --> 32:51.469
All right, five more minutes.

32:53.888 --> 32:58.810
{\an1}This is so...
I don't know, weird?

32:58.893 --> 32:59.936
Fascinating?

33:00.019 --> 33:02.563
{\an1}It's like I know
every inch of this beach,

33:02.647 --> 33:05.400
{\an1}but I'm seeing it
for the first time.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.068
Does that make any sense?

33:07.151 --> 33:10.405
Yeah.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.408
{\an3}You ever hear of the Danish
philosopher Kierkegaard?

33:13.491 --> 33:15.493
Don't remind me.

33:15.576 --> 33:16.953
{\an1}I had to plow
through his essays

33:17.036 --> 33:18.496
{\an1}when I took
sophomore philosophy.

33:18.579 --> 33:19.580
{\an3}Not exactly
easy reading.

33:19.664 --> 33:20.707
No.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.292
{\an3}Wait a second, you remember
sophomore philosophy?

33:23.376 --> 33:27.046
{\an1}Oh, yeah, our instructor
was Dr. Johanssen.

33:27.130 --> 33:31.968
He had this big wart...

33:32.051 --> 33:34.262
{\an1}Oh, my God, now I'm
starting to remember.

33:34.345 --> 33:37.890
{\an1}I live in a beach house
not far from here.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.559
My room is red

33:39.642 --> 33:41.728
{\an1}and Donna has the room
right next to me.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.398
No, I don't.

33:45.481 --> 33:47.817
{\an1}Brandon told me that I live
someplace else with him.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.402
I don't live at the beach.

33:49.485 --> 33:50.278
No, you did.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.779
{\an3}Donna and you were
roommates for years.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.574
{\an3}Don't, don't rush it,
don't do anything.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.409
Just let it come
when it's ready.

33:56.492 --> 33:58.536
{\an1}I don't know
if I want to remember.

34:00.204 --> 34:03.833
{\an1}Not many people get a chance
to have a whole new start.

34:03.916 --> 34:05.543
I'd give anything for that.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.309
{\an4}Where the hell have
you two been?
Hey, B.

34:21.391 --> 34:22.768
What's up?
I've been sitting here

34:22.851 --> 34:24.520
{\an1}for the last two hours,
that's what's up.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.481
We went to the beach.

34:26.563 --> 34:27.482
The beach?

34:27.565 --> 34:28.649
Yeah, yeah, it was great.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.485
I felt the sun on my face.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.277
Hey, why don't I just
leave you two to catch up?

34:32.360 --> 34:34.362
B, you wanna grab a beer later?

34:34.447 --> 34:35.531
No, I don't think so.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.574
Okay, cool.

34:37.658 --> 34:39.159
Big day today, huh?

34:39.243 --> 34:41.329
You better get some rest.

34:41.411 --> 34:42.455
I'll check with you tomorrow.

34:42.538 --> 34:44.331
Okay, thank you, Noah.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.458
All right.

34:49.378 --> 34:50.797
Going to the beach--
don't you think,

34:50.880 --> 34:53.674
uh, that's maybe pushing
things a little?

34:53.757 --> 34:55.342
No, I don't.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.178
Brandon, when I
was at the beach

34:57.261 --> 34:59.680
I started to remember things.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.516
I could practically
see the beach house

35:01.599 --> 35:05.520
{\an3}and Donna, Clare,
my room.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.021
Well, that's great.
Anything else?

35:07.105 --> 35:09.440
Mmm, just little things.

35:09.524 --> 35:12.193
And wh-what about us?

35:12.276 --> 35:13.736
No.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.531
I still can't remember.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.115
I'm sorry, Brandon.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.880
Not in the pound,
not in the neighborhood,

35:32.964 --> 35:35.049
probably dead
in the road somewhere.

35:35.132 --> 35:38.386
I don't know how much longer
I can stall Jane Schulze.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.680
I've already called her
twice with excuses.

35:40.763 --> 35:43.015
Donna, I'm telling you,

35:43.099 --> 35:45.226
someone must have found him
and taken him in.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.727
He doesn't have
a name tag on.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.396
How are we gonna find out?

35:48.479 --> 35:49.730
You know what, forget it.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.023
{\an1}I'm just gonna
call her right now;

35:51.107 --> 35:53.025
I'm gonna tell her everything.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.404
At 11:00? I think you're
just gonna have to wait

35:56.487 --> 35:59.240
until you take her
the clothes tomorrow.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.242
(sighs)

36:09.125 --> 36:10.251
Hey, B, nice morning, huh?

36:10.334 --> 36:12.211
If you say so.

36:13.462 --> 36:15.047
{\an1}Okay, let me guess.
Kelly, right?

36:15.131 --> 36:17.550
What the hell were you thinking,
taking her to the beach?

36:17.633 --> 36:19.760
Man, you don't want an
explanation, you want a fight.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.096
You chill out and I'll
come down and talk.

36:22.179 --> 36:23.431
Let's talk right now.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.099
All right, you're entitled.

36:25.182 --> 36:26.434
She is your girlfriend.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.311
I'm glad we agree on that.

36:28.394 --> 36:30.605
{\an1}Look, man, it was no
secret rendezvous, okay?

36:30.688 --> 36:32.064
Didn't Kelly tell you?

36:32.148 --> 36:33.941
Her doctor thought it'd
be good for her to get out.

36:34.025 --> 36:34.775
And it was.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.485
And you just happened
to be there.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.446
I made a promise,
I keep my promises.

36:38.529 --> 36:41.282
How many other things
have you promised Kelly?

36:41.365 --> 36:42.825
Or Valerie, for that matter.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.452
{\an3}Noah, why don't you
do me a favor?

36:44.535 --> 36:45.786
Give me a list of the people
you're not involved with.

36:45.870 --> 36:46.913
It'll be a lot shorter.

36:46.996 --> 36:48.831
Look, whoever I see is none
of your damn business.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.499
It is when it comes to Kelly.

36:53.544 --> 36:54.962
(sighs)

36:55.046 --> 36:56.964
Look, man, it's not
my style to get involved

36:57.048 --> 36:58.424
with something
like you and Kelly.

36:58.507 --> 36:59.634
It never was.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.093
If I'm treading too close,

37:01.177 --> 37:02.470
give me the word, I'll back off.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.472
As far as I'm concerned

37:04.555 --> 37:06.599
you and Kelly have always
been meant to be together.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.145
I hope you're right.

37:30.581 --> 37:31.958
{\an3}Good luck.

37:37.546 --> 37:38.464
(sighs)

37:38.547 --> 37:43.135
Mrs. Schulze, I am
very sorry, but Goliath...

37:43.219 --> 37:46.013
Mrs. Schulze, first,
may I point out

37:46.097 --> 37:47.390
how lovely you look today?

37:47.473 --> 37:49.475
Now about Goliath...

37:49.558 --> 37:53.020
Mrs. Schulze, do you believe
in alien abductions?

37:53.104 --> 37:54.522
(whispers):
No...

37:59.777 --> 38:01.153

Beer.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.063
Noah?

38:36.147 --> 38:37.523
Oh, my God,

38:37.606 --> 38:39.150
it's been...

38:39.233 --> 38:40.568
Holy Christmas!

38:40.651 --> 38:41.360
Where have you been?

38:41.444 --> 38:42.737
What do you say, Luce?

38:42.820 --> 38:44.739
I say you're a sight.
Man, I haven't

38:44.822 --> 38:46.032
seen you since...
Yeah, we got a lot

38:46.115 --> 38:47.199
of catching up to do.

38:47.283 --> 38:47.950
How 'bout a round of beers

38:49.452 --> 38:50.161
{\an3}LUCY:
Promise now?

38:50.244 --> 38:51.746
I want some quality
time with you.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.789
Four beers, coming up.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.211
Well, you've got some
interesting friends.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.379

39:00.463 --> 39:02.089
Real salt of the earth,
you know?

39:02.173 --> 39:03.257
You from around here?

39:03.340 --> 39:05.760
{\an3}No, from back
East, originally.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.470
{\an1}You know, this band's
not too bad.

39:07.553 --> 39:10.598
Yeah, it's the backup band.
The next one's even better.

39:10.681 --> 39:11.891
Okay, drink up, boys.

39:13.851 --> 39:14.810
Thanks.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.437
So, did you go to
school back East?

39:16.520 --> 39:18.064
What is it you want to know?

39:18.147 --> 39:20.941
{\an3}Huh? What do
you want to know?

39:21.025 --> 39:23.444
I went to Harvard,
my parents are very wealthy,

39:23.527 --> 39:24.987
and I work on boats to
keep my head straight.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.113
Right.

39:27.531 --> 39:28.449
{\an3}DAVID:
Steve, you, uh,

39:28.532 --> 39:30.910
think you can beat me
at a game of eight ball?

39:30.993 --> 39:32.286

She asked about you.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.471
Hey, look, B, when she gets it
all back together, I mean,

39:50.554 --> 39:52.389
I'm gonna be the one
she doesn't remember.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.978
You know, I just...

39:58.062 --> 40:00.106
I feel like I'm... I'm stuck
in cement, you know?

40:00.189 --> 40:01.649
I can't go forward,
I can't go backward.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.359
The Seattle job, huh?

40:03.442 --> 40:07.029
I really want the job.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.656
But I want Kelly more.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.324
We're not that different, B.

40:10.407 --> 40:12.993
You know, believe it or not
I used to be a lot like you.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.829
{\an3}You know, everything
always came easy.

40:14.912 --> 40:18.165
I didn't work that much.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.333
It was all right there.

40:19.416 --> 40:20.626
Like you.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.336
What are you saying?

40:24.422 --> 40:25.798
<i>Carpe diem,</i> man.

40:25.881 --> 40:27.174
It's Latin for "Seize the day."

40:27.258 --> 40:29.218
{\an3}I had to find
out the hard way.

40:29.301 --> 40:31.679
{\an3}You get just
one of each day.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.849
And when you lose that
day, it's gone forever.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.392
{\an3}I don't want you
to wake up one day

40:36.475 --> 40:39.311
{\an3}realizing you've lost more
days than you can even count.

40:39.395 --> 40:40.521
Without Kelly, I just...

40:40.604 --> 40:42.690
Without Kelly you're
still Brandon, okay?

40:42.773 --> 40:43.983
Don't lose him, man.

40:44.066 --> 40:45.568
You've got passion.

40:45.651 --> 40:47.862
{\an3}If you want to wait for
Kelly, fine, wait for her.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.071
But use that passion.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.281
{\an3}Now, if you want to
write, go write.

40:50.364 --> 40:52.366
You don't have to go
to Seattle to do it.

40:52.449 --> 40:55.369
It's where you are, man,
it's not the geography.

40:59.081 --> 41:02.418
Huh, nobody's that lucky.

41:02.501 --> 41:03.752
It's not luck.

41:03.836 --> 41:05.045
{\an1}It's skill, baby,
all skill.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.255
Skill? Rack them up.

41:06.338 --> 41:08.632
We'll try it again
in a minute. Here.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.428
Hey, Bran, order me
another beer, okay?

41:12.511 --> 41:14.221
I'm going to use the bathroom.
Hmm.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.223
I'm coming with you.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.225
(rock music playing)

41:18.309 --> 41:20.561
{\an1}So, what are we gonna call
this little rag of ours?

41:20.644 --> 41:23.022
We? Ours?

41:23.105 --> 41:25.733
Yeah, I've been
giving it some thought

41:25.816 --> 41:29.111
and, uh, you know, a little
paint, a little imagination.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.863
Are you serious?

41:30.946 --> 41:32.072
Never more.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.490
Really, you'll do this?

41:33.574 --> 41:34.909
You are serious?

41:34.992 --> 41:35.951
Conditions.

41:36.035 --> 41:38.370
Okay, let's hear them.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.623
Not many.
You handle all the business.

41:40.706 --> 41:43.417
I get full editorial authority.
What I say goes in goes in.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.377
What I say stays out
stays out-- that's it.

41:45.461 --> 41:46.879
That's it?
That's it.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.088
That's all?
That's all.

41:48.172 --> 41:51.091
Oh, boy, you drive
a hard bargain, Brandon.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.426
Let me think about this.

41:52.509 --> 41:54.136
Okay, deal!

41:54.220 --> 41:56.263
Deal. Ah!

41:56.347 --> 41:57.640
No massage parlor ads.

41:57.723 --> 41:59.558
{\an3}Bran, where do you
think all the money is?

41:59.642 --> 42:01.310
We'll have to find the
money somewhere else.

42:01.393 --> 42:03.729
{\an3}Oh, after you.
After you.

42:03.812 --> 42:05.898
{\an3}Thank you.

42:29.421 --> 42:30.798
I miss you.

42:30.881 --> 42:33.133
{\an1}I miss you more
than you'll ever know.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.094
I'm not going to Seattle.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.221
I'm staying right here.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.641
I just wanted to tell you that.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.813
You get some sleep.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.982
See you tomorrow.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.109
