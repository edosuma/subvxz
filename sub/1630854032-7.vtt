00:06.089 --> 00:07.590
Previously on rick and morty.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.134
Jerry I had sex with your wife.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.262
I did it, I fixed portal travel.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.556
Jack the Ripper, at your service.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.141
-Cool.
-This happened too?

00:16.224 --> 00:18.935
-I’m pregnant.
-Honey, she’s just like you.

00:19.018 --> 00:20.937
-It’s raining meatballs.
-Okay something is...

00:21.020 --> 00:24.941
Jerry Smith died doing what he loved,
getting stung by bees.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.359
-Off.
-Off what?

00:26.443 --> 00:28.445
Have some respect, it’s Dad’s funeral.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.405
I’m gonna name you Jerry Jr.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.115
Thanks for solving that murder guys,

00:32.198 --> 00:33.825
-here’s a skateboard.
-Thanks Tony Hawk.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.118
-Morty, say you’ll marry me.
-What?

00:35.201 --> 00:36.161
-What?
-Just say yes!

00:36.244 --> 00:37.787
-Yes?
-Okay.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.081
-Rick, do you promise to...
-I do and for our honeymoon

00:40.165 --> 00:42.375
let's go to a sealed chamber
lined with ionized deuterium!

00:42.459 --> 00:43.710
-Why?
-Because the charge acts

00:43.793 --> 00:46.212
as a narrative decelerant.
Morty, none of this is real,

00:46.296 --> 00:48.465
we’re in a Previously On spiral,
clear your head.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.216
-After all that’s happened?
-No.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.803
I’m innocent! I didn’t release those bees!
I love Jerry!

00:53.887 --> 00:55.096
What’d I just say?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.556
-When?
-Okay, great execution,

00:56.639 --> 00:58.099
let’s go back to the chamber.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.935
Now repeat after me, Morty:
Next time on Rick and Morty.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.729
Next time on Rick and Morty?

01:02.812 --> 01:05.523
-No. Previously on Rick and Morty.
-Ignore it, Morty.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.192
Next time on Rick and Morty.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.736
-It counteracts his toxins.
-Next time on Rick and Morty.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.571
-Whose toxins?
-Hey stop it!

01:11.946 --> 01:13.323
Previous Leon. Grab him!

01:14.491 --> 01:16.868
Hold on tight, Morty! We gotta get
through the opening titles!

01:16.951 --> 01:18.328
Opening titles of what?

01:18.787 --> 01:19.996
-We’re in space.
-Let go of me.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.667
Oh my god! Oh my god!

01:28.630 --> 01:30.715
-What planet is this?
-Cover you eyes on this part!

01:31.090 --> 01:32.842
Oh my god, it’s a giant squirrel

01:33.676 --> 01:35.470
Why are we dressed like old timey people?

01:35.553 --> 01:37.347
-What the hell’s going on?
-Oh my god, no way.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.350
Why is my dad in a suit?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.393
-Best episode!
-Who is that?

01:42.477 --> 01:43.520
OK, we’re almost through.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.487
And we’re back!

01:52.570 --> 01:54.864
-Stop! Let go of me!
-What just happened?

01:54.948 --> 01:55.907
Why was there music?

01:57.075 --> 02:00.036
Because of this conceptual little
piece of shit! Grab his feet!

02:00.119 --> 02:02.580
If we have opening titles,
does that mean that we’re a...

02:03.456 --> 02:06.125
Let your body purge the meta-venom,
Morty, don’t succumb to his

02:06.209 --> 02:08.670
-pointless self aware bullshit.
-It’s not pointless, it’s cool!

02:09.587 --> 02:11.172
-He’s got a gun!
-Eat lead, pussy!

02:13.550 --> 02:15.593
No no no! Fuck!

02:18.513 --> 02:19.848
-Son of a...
-Did he use a portal?

02:19.931 --> 02:22.433
He wishes. He wriggled back
to the meta layer through a hole

02:22.517 --> 02:24.561
in the fourth wall.
Put these on and help me find it.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.273
I don’t like this, Rick.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.400
You shouldn’t,
it’s not a likable premise.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.443
I mean it’s funny when
I do a little nod to viewers

02:32.527 --> 02:33.403
-but...
-What viewers?

02:33.486 --> 02:34.946
That’s the right attitude, Morty.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.240
A few carefree verbal asides,
always by me,

02:37.323 --> 02:39.409
none of this Season Three
Moonlighting shit.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.286
-Okay, here it is.
-You’re going to patch it?

02:41.369 --> 02:43.580
No, he subverted actual reality, Morty,

02:43.663 --> 02:45.874
he needs to be put down like a rabid dog.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.092
-Fuck!
-Oh yeah,

02:56.175 --> 02:57.760
no, you don’t wanna wear those over here.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.722
Maybe he went down that road?

03:00.805 --> 03:02.682
No no no, if he took that he’d end
up a hero.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.475
Dammit, Rick. I don’t like this.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.145
-is this whole place just...
-A bunch of groan-inducing wordplay

03:07.228 --> 03:09.272
for seven TV critics
that won’t even enjoy it?

03:09.355 --> 03:12.483
It’s worse than you think, Morty,
we’re basting in meta radiation right now,

03:12.567 --> 03:14.319
our credibility is being
permanently eroded,

03:14.402 --> 03:17.614
every second we spend here is the
equivalent to ten Space Jam cameos.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.283
-You should've thought of that previously
-Get him!

03:26.831 --> 03:29.375
Oh no! Bless me Heavenly Father
for you will save me...

03:29.459 --> 03:31.252
Now I feel bad.
Let’s just get out of here.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.462
Because he prays?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.255
You know Hitler was Catholic, right?

03:35.089 --> 03:36.299
I’m here, Leon.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.427
Okay. He apparently prays very well.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.180
-Time for you two to meet the Lord.
-That’s okay, we’re good.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.308
Treat it like a bear attack, just walk
backwards and make yourself look big.

03:46.059 --> 03:50.313
I love a good refusal of the call.
Hello, Rick.

03:50.396 --> 03:54.484
-Hello, Amish Juggler?
-His name is Story Lord.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.027
Story Lord?

03:56.110 --> 03:58.571
Listen, trust me, take Amish Juggler,
you can have it.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.991
Story Lord. Rick, he’s the villain from
that toy train I bought you.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.452
Very good, Morty. The fictional
versions of you trapped me

04:04.535 --> 04:07.413
in a Bible show for children
but I used make-believe Christ

04:07.497 --> 04:10.124
to transcend fiction
and enter meta-reality.

04:10.625 --> 04:14.462
Now I’m the one doing the trapping
Leon was the bait.

04:14.545 --> 04:15.755
-Bait?
-Jesus?

04:19.592 --> 04:21.177
Never dumb mother!

04:25.014 --> 04:28.059
You’re using Jesus to beat us up?
Have you seen South Park?

04:28.142 --> 04:30.687
Good call-out, Morty,
that’s the kind of meta I like,

04:30.770 --> 04:33.064
the kind that keeps us
creatively accountable.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.066
Oh god. Not the Bane.
Not the Bane!

04:36.484 --> 04:39.529
He Baned me, Morty!
Jesus Baned me!

04:40.571 --> 04:43.825
You can’t beat me up,
I’m technically Christian child!

04:43.908 --> 04:45.910
And I’m your worst nightmare.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.371
I’m the Jesus from every Jesus joke.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.957
-The one without a God.
-Morty! Take this and get out!

04:52.792 --> 04:57.630
Thank you. Looks like Story Lord’s story
is about to become based on real events.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.675
-What do you want with that?
-I want what any character wants.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.552
-Motivation.
-What?

05:03.177 --> 05:04.554
-That’s dumb.
-So lazy.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.222
Forward your notes to my ass.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.101
Wait wha... he just left?

05:10.184 --> 05:12.687
Kinda makes you want to be
our unlikely ally huh?

05:12.770 --> 05:13.688
I guess not.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.234
Previously on Jesus Christ.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.445
-Hey, I’m Jesus.
-I’m Mary.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.904
-That’s my mom’s name.
-Stop.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.949
-Dude, she’s a hooker.
-She’s a better disciple than you!

05:29.829 --> 05:30.747
Oh no.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.207
I can’t die.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.376
I have a proposition for you.

05:35.877 --> 05:36.836
I work alone.

05:39.964 --> 05:43.426
If I suck-a your blood,
I’ll be invincible! I think!

05:43.509 --> 05:44.594
You’ll never know.

05:45.470 --> 05:49.348
Billionaire immortal entrepreneur
Jesus Christ has placed all his money

05:49.432 --> 05:52.143
into what he’s calling a
“second chance at love.”

05:52.518 --> 05:57.023
-Hang on, Mary!
-The data! So beautiful!

05:57.523 --> 05:59.525
Make me normal, witch.

06:00.276 --> 06:03.071
Take it all!

06:03.154 --> 06:04.447
Eat your pudding, Mr. Christ.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.992
-What are you smiling at?
-Your name.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.414
-What’s happening, Rick?
-Leon’s venom makes you think

06:13.498 --> 06:16.834
more and more of your life is behind you
as he feeds on your released potential.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.254
Leon. You saved our lives!

06:20.338 --> 06:22.298
-Oh not yet he hasn’t.
-Jeez Rick!

06:22.381 --> 06:23.466
-So mean!
-He’s meta, Morty.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.801
His life doesn’t matter.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.761
Yours does. That’s why
we need to get back.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.722
Well this doesn’t feel like a Citadel.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.643
Maybe it’s cooler on the inside?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.230
This isn’t what it looks like.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.816
This is a very special diet
for successful writers.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.152
-Why do you look like my character?
-I am your character.

06:43.236 --> 06:47.198
-And you are going to improve me.
-But you’re Story Lord, you’re great.

06:47.281 --> 06:51.327
Great isn’t good enough!
I’ve killed Rick and made myself real.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.788
I’m better than some shitty toy train.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.332
Is this your office or your apartment?

06:56.415 --> 06:57.750
Why does it smell like you sleep here?

06:58.376 --> 07:01.212
-You’re my creator, why are you pathetic?
-Because you failed!

07:01.295 --> 07:03.798
And whose fault is that?
What the hell happened?

07:03.881 --> 07:05.925
You wanna know what happened?
Like specifically?

07:06.008 --> 07:08.678
Well the Ricks wanted to do
a Canterbury Tales type thing,

07:08.761 --> 07:10.930
but none of them have actually
read fucking Canterbury Tales,

07:11.013 --> 07:13.057
so then they told me to make
it like the Poker Game episode

07:13.141 --> 07:16.102
of the Batman cartoon where the
bad guys tell stories about Batman.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.187
Then they kept telling me it
“needed something.”

07:18.271 --> 07:22.024
Yeah no shit it needed something!
It needed to never be pitched!

07:22.108 --> 07:25.695
I did my job! Goomby, the Ice Queen,
the Tickets Please guy.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.573
They just bailed on it! The website
didn’t even fucking work!

07:28.656 --> 07:32.243
And it was a shitty URL to begin with,
“Storydash Train”?

07:32.326 --> 07:34.996
Who uses a dash?
They set me up to fail!

07:35.079 --> 07:38.583
They fucked me! They fucked me and you're
lucky I haven’t blown my brains out!

07:39.292 --> 07:41.460
Right. Just give me a motivation,
you hacky fart.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.879
Okay, here’s your motivation.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.841
You’re looking for motivation.
You want all the motivation.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.050
That’s lazy.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.303
It got you this far.
Must be nice, by the way,

07:50.386 --> 07:53.639
wish I could afford to dress like a
bisexual acting coach from the seventies.

07:54.098 --> 07:58.436
-My motivation... is motivation.
-Okay, bye.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.814
Oh no, my bitter friend,
you’re coming with me.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.903
Yo! If you don’t see me coming
it’s a bad fortress!

08:08.905 --> 08:11.908
-Where are we?
-Headquarters of The Self Referential Six.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.702
They’re meta nerds that found out
they could be less bearable as a team.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.205
-They can help us?
-No but there’s a prisoner here that can.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.916
-Don’t tell them that.
-Rick Sanchez.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.251
I’ve been waiting
for this moment for years.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.504
Good, Morty, this is Miss... Lead.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.673
I should kill you where you stand.

08:29.050 --> 08:32.261
I brought you Previous Leon. You’ll want
to lock him up in your detention center.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.013
It’s a trick, he wants your prisoner.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.014
-You dick.
-Liar!

08:35.640 --> 08:37.975
Talk about a mislead. Anti-meta field.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.479
Fancy device. I think I can recall
the time you built it.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.064
Don’t try it, Flash Back!

08:45.608 --> 08:47.526
Y’know I’m excited about
the upcoming election.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.697
This forcefield will be impenetrable by
meta-energy. It runs on hydrogen isotopes.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.952
It runs on hydrogen isotopes.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.621
A few barrels of petroleum
should dampen it.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.289
Run, Morty!

09:01.290 --> 09:05.378
Were those not there before? Guess
there’s been a... Connie Tinuityerror.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.173
-These people are the worst!
-I told you! Way overpowered!

09:11.592 --> 09:13.761
-Look out, Rick!
-Forget him, he’s a nameless guard.

09:15.554 --> 09:16.681
That’s Protago Nick.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.308
His beam has the power to make
any character the protagonist.

09:20.559 --> 09:21.477
Duck.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.856
Oh man, oh man.

09:26.857 --> 09:30.319
What are you doing, Marvin?
Not dying, that’s what I’m doing!

09:31.737 --> 09:33.531
What’s going on? What happened?

09:33.614 --> 09:36.158
I did it again, Katie.
I ran out on another job.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.412
Well if you didn’t do that,
you wouldn’t be my man.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.222
I was almost tempted to just let it go,
that’s much how I hate it here.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.223
Smash Cut!

09:59.765 --> 10:02.226
-Remember me, Rick?
-Who’s this guy now?

10:02.310 --> 10:07.231
I am Mr. Twist. The fifth member
of the Self Referential Six.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.693
-Who’s the sixth?
-That’s the twist, Morty. It's you.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.902
-What?
-Ignore him, Morty.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.446
The twist is there is no sixth member

10:13.529 --> 10:16.198
-and he tells that to everybody.
-In any case, you’re ours now.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.660
You can’t free yourself without
a twist and I control them.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.913
You don’t control every twist, Mr. Twist.
I’ve got a twist for you.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.457
Impossible! What is it?

10:25.708 --> 10:28.127
Nice try! Like I didn’t see that coming

10:29.837 --> 10:31.547
Fuck me.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.717
-Great work, Morty!
-I’m adapting!

10:34.800 --> 10:35.885
Here’s our ticket outta here.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.929
They got him in a cell made outta of
sports because it’s the opposite of story.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.807
-Do I want to ask who he is?
-His name is Brett Caan.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.685
He has the power to make things
always have been other things.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.480
I think that’s called retconning.
But his name’s Brett Caan?

10:47.563 --> 10:50.232
Rhett’s a name too,
his name could be Rhett Caan.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.069
It is.
And always has been, now.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.197
Careful Morty.
Stay clear of his retcon range.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.698
Until he agrees to help us.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.867
Rick. You’ve always trusted me.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.911
Nice try.
Here’s how it’s gonna work.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.205
You’re gonna make it so
Morty and I never came here.

11:04.288 --> 11:07.333
Once that’s always been the case,
I’ll free you remotely with this.

11:07.708 --> 11:08.834
What is my purpose?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.669
To wait until I tell you
to pull that lever.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.129
You are fucking kidding me.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.758
If you don’t free me right now Rick,
I can make very, very bad things

11:15.841 --> 11:17.510
always have been the case for you.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.636
Is that a threat, you fuck?

11:18.719 --> 11:20.763
-You can rot in there.
-Rick.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.308
You know what, Rhett? Forget what I said,
we’ve always been friends.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.559
Good one.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.105
Easy, Rhett. Don’t forget
that coffee mug I gave you.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.650
You always were able
to be killed with coffee.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.821
New plan. Run. Again.

11:37.196 --> 11:41.117
-The twist being...
-You were born without bones.

11:42.952 --> 11:43.869
See ya never!

11:45.538 --> 11:47.957
There’s never been anything
outside this fortress.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.000
-Goddammit!
-And this fortress

11:50.084 --> 11:53.212
Has always been an orange!

11:56.549 --> 11:58.801
-Great plan, Rick!
-Yeah, I’m not pushing back on that Morty,

11:58.884 --> 12:00.469
I have royally fucked us.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.766
-It hurts.
-We’ve been past the fourth wall too long.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.309
We won’t be real much longer.

12:07.643 --> 12:11.105
You killed us, Rick. You just
had to hate meta storytelling.

12:12.189 --> 12:15.484
In my defense, Morty, I think you
can agree my hate was justified.

12:16.735 --> 12:21.031
Least earned death ever.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.621
Death is a threshold.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.796
-What, what happened?
-You atoned.

12:36.505 --> 12:39.633
-Who, who are you?
-I’m Joseph Campbell. Soup?

12:40.259 --> 12:43.345
I almost considered not making
it because my name is Campbell but,

12:43.679 --> 12:46.348
then I thought, stay in the moment, Joe.
Follow your bliss.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.310
How are you here?
Rhett Caan said there was nothing.

12:49.393 --> 12:53.564
Some things never change about mythology.
There’s always an old man with soup.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.900
Name one story that doesn’t have one.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.152
-Jack and the Beanstalk.
-Basketball Diaries.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.862
-Every Matrix.
-Every movie ever.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.947
Alright, I don’t have to defend myself
to you people.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.324
Where’s my soup?

13:03.949 --> 13:06.952
Previous Fuckin’ Leon?
Why is that prick here?

13:07.036 --> 13:09.205
No more a prick than you, friend.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.540
Meta characters erode reality.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.792
But all characters are meta, Rick.

13:13.876 --> 13:18.214
All of us are nourished and consumed
by chaos, like newborns at the breast

13:18.297 --> 13:21.217
of a meth addict
in a lifeboat filled with forks.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.303
-I know what you have to do, Rick.
-Scrub Campbell’s browser history?

13:24.386 --> 13:26.096
Just trust Previous Leon.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.432
Could you Previously us a way home?

13:29.725 --> 13:32.770
-I’ll sure enjoy trying.
-Yeah I bet you would.

13:32.853 --> 13:37.399
Rick can’t change, Morty. Change is
what you might call his Kryptonite.

13:37.483 --> 13:41.320
Except, instead of being super,
he’s, you know, kind of a pussy.

13:41.946 --> 13:42.905
Let’s do it.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.367
Previously on Rick.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.619
-Get off him! Get off him!
-Oh boy.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.206
-He almost killed you!
-Okay, well I feel bad,

13:52.289 --> 13:54.083
I kind of pressured you into trying that.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.043
-You called me a pussy!
-I said I feel bad!

13:56.752 --> 14:00.798
This is a map to a region
rich in narrative ore.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.550
I wish you the best of luck.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.719
Faster, Morty! I’d help but I can’t
blister my inventing hands.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.179
-How long will it take?
-Years.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.597
You can live in my wood shed.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.267
-Just don’t open the door after dark.
-Why not?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.352
Get out here you Communist Jews!

14:13.435 --> 14:15.271
Dude. Maybe I’m not an alcoholic.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.065
-I know, right?
-You fucking Back to the Future ripoffs!

14:19.191 --> 14:20.859
-It’s ready.
-Rick, I should stay.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.236
-Why?
-I’m pregnant.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.529
-What are you doing?
-It wasn’t him, Rick!

14:23.612 --> 14:25.281
-Then who?
-Me.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.784
I never left. But you had to think
all this happened to make that.

14:28.867 --> 14:31.787
-And I can get this through the titles?
-If you hang on tight.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.789
What about my beard and unborn child?

14:33.872 --> 14:35.124
Let them go.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.084
-Thank you, Leon.
-When you get home Rick,

14:37.167 --> 14:39.753
do some classic adventures.
Like season one.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.464
I’m so sick of that fucking note,
what the fuck does it even mean?

14:51.056 --> 14:53.309
Now. One last time.
What’s my motivation?

14:53.892 --> 14:57.646
Motivation. This machine will syphon
it from everyone in the universe.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.356
Perfect. Greenlit. Launch it.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.113
I think it’s working. Yes, I can feel it!

15:06.196 --> 15:08.782
Something I did is actually
affecting someone!

15:12.995 --> 15:14.038
I don’t want to work anymore.

15:14.121 --> 15:17.374
I do, but only as an excuse
to not practice guitar.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.174
Why don’t we just write any number
down on the score sheet?

15:25.257 --> 15:26.342
Why even do that?

15:30.638 --> 15:31.930
Wait, you have to register?

15:32.389 --> 15:37.019
Yes! I can feel it!
I’m so motivated!

15:37.603 --> 15:39.271
I want a lot!

15:41.899 --> 15:42.941
Story time’s over.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.694
-Hardly your decision.
-Did you seriously

15:45.778 --> 15:48.113
double down on motivation
as your motivation?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.282
-It’s a good idea.
-There’s no such thing!

15:50.366 --> 15:52.951
There’s joyful and there’s joyless.
And we’ve had our fill of one.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.246
Morty, make that sweaty writer stop
working while I kill off his character.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.793
I have never been more driven
to destroy someone.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.670
Yeah well I’m driven
to lower my blood sugar

16:02.753 --> 16:05.089
but guess who’s getting tacos
after he kicks your ass?

16:06.465 --> 16:08.050
So you’re jacked, who cares?

16:09.510 --> 16:11.345
-Cum gutters.
-I don’t like that phrase.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.513
I don’t take notes.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.144
You can’t beat me, Rick.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.564
-I have one million times your motivation!
-So do those guys

16:22.648 --> 16:24.566
with the cell phone kiosks at the mall.

16:50.592 --> 16:53.429
-The hair is wrong.
-Like you’d be picky about licensing.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.389
Actually, I would.
I happen to believe that...

17:02.438 --> 17:04.523
-You can do that?
-You gotta want it.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.359
Come on, just stop,
I don’t wanna fight you.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.279
Kid, I’m a writer that wrote
something successful,

17:10.362 --> 17:11.447
so if you want me to give it up

17:11.530 --> 17:13.574
you’re gonna need a black belt
or a big pair of tits.

17:13.657 --> 17:17.161
-Yeah well I don’t have those.
-In the mythical sense, I have both.

17:17.244 --> 17:20.122
-Joseph Campbell?
-Yeah, nice try. He died in the eighties.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.416
Only you can see and hear me Morty.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.418
-Just repeat what I tell you.
-Okay.

17:26.003 --> 17:30.466
Sir. You’re only proud of your creation’s
success because you want to be creative,

17:30.549 --> 17:34.219
but creation doesn’t happen through
gimmicks, technology and distribution.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.679
It doesn’t even happen through work.

17:36.054 --> 17:40.225
Creativity is frankly adjacent to mental
and overlaps with it substantially.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.437
A lot of talented people kill themselves
and all of them are miserable.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.981
The real gift is to be ungifted,

17:46.064 --> 17:48.150
and from what I saw in your
Green Arrow spec script,

17:48.609 --> 17:51.612
-that’s the gift you were given.
-You couldn’t have seen that.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.405
I’m Joseph Campbell. I saw it.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.241
-The villain was a placeholder.
-I said I saw it Jan,

17:56.325 --> 17:59.995
I didn’t say I could get past page five.
Your villains aren’t the problem.

18:00.078 --> 18:02.289
The problem is, when you write,
you’re a villain.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.666
If you want to be a hero, just stop.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.675
You know what? Maybe I will register.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.679
Say it! Tell me I’m the new Mr. Nimbus!

18:20.766 --> 18:23.352
-Oh looks like your writer took a hiatus.
-Oh fuck.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.772
You’re less motivated to fight now
so this is literally punching down

18:26.855 --> 18:27.856
but you’ve got it coming.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.779
Please, lemme live.
I promise to be cooler.

18:34.154 --> 18:37.032
I’ll be less inside baseball,
maybe I change my name?

18:39.785 --> 18:44.039
-You failed me.
-No, I failed you.

18:45.916 --> 18:49.294
All good things must come to an end.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.964
All bad things too though,
so don’t flatter yourself.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.134
Jan, Joseph Campbell says you have to be
the one to put him down.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.553
Wait wait wait, Joseph Campbell also says

18:57.636 --> 19:00.472
you have to use this brand new
limited edition Rick plush,

19:00.556 --> 19:03.559
available only on Rick dash plush dot biz.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.227
-Supplies are limited. Act now.
-He did?

19:18.156 --> 19:20.826
Jesus, that’s the last time
I buy a toy from a Rick.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.411
The plushies are obviously well made.

19:28.625 --> 19:32.296
-Thanks for getting us back alive, Rick.
-Well, I am a master of both worlds Morty.

19:35.173 --> 19:39.094
Joseph Campbell told me to stop writing.
Because it should be effortless.

19:39.177 --> 19:41.430
When it happens organically,
that’s when it’s meant to be.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.307
Y’know, like, like me.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.684
I’m a writer, here’s a pencil.
Writers use pencils.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.269
Okay so like what if like
a pencil used me?

19:47.352 --> 19:49.897
Like okay. Yeah. Okay.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.941
so it’s like a magic pencil
that writes the writer’s life.

19:53.025 --> 19:57.404
holy shit, it’s a movie
about a writer! I am back!

20:31.230 --> 20:34.316
I’m Tag-Man. I live in the tag.

20:35.442 --> 20:39.863
I am the tag. I’m Tag-Man.
Tag-tag of the episode Man.

20:40.238 --> 20:42.950
Did you get any of that? When, yeah,
when, an episode’s over, look out,

20:43.033 --> 20:46.662
because here comes Tag-Man!
And I’m crazy!

20:47.079 --> 20:51.667
Tag-man! Imma tag your ass! Tag dat ass.

20:52.042 --> 20:56.672
Tag-Ass-Man! I’m an Ass-Man now!
I’m a, I’m a Tag-Man!

20:56.755 --> 20:59.841
Here’s what you get, here’s your tag!
Yeah, you want some more?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.344
You want, you want some more tag
you sick piece of shit?!

21:02.427 --> 21:04.012
I’m, because I’m Tag Man!

21:05.222 --> 21:10.310
I miss my wife. Too bad,
this is it! Tag-Man, yeah!
