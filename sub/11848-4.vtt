04:21.125 --> 04:22.928
Spacey?

04:23.812 --> 04:26.168
Spacey!

04:35.463 --> 04:37.688
What the fuck is this?

04:39.274 --> 04:42.113
No more, you hear me?
No more...

04:43.013 --> 04:46.737
Freeze!  Police.
Throw down your weapon.

04:47.565 --> 04:52.450
It's too late!
It's too fucking late!

04:52.599 --> 04:54.411
Let her go.
Now!

04:54.982 --> 04:58.088
Go away.
You don't know what she is.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.525
- You have no idea!
- Don't do it.

05:01.002 --> 05:02.844
Don't do it ...

05:46.728 --> 05:49.945
Jennifer.

05:58.085 --> 05:59.731
Frank!

06:02.916 --> 06:05.168
What the fuck!
You okay?

06:05.169 --> 06:07.374
You call it in.

06:09.469 --> 06:12.072
This guy tried to chop her up.

06:13.082 --> 06:17.088
- I had to stop it.
- Jesus. What a mess!

06:26.410 --> 06:29.103
All right.
Come on...

06:38.933 --> 06:41.706
Okay, uh...

06:43.175 --> 06:46.563
Okay! All right.
It's okay. It's all right.

06:46.564 --> 06:48.198
Ow my!

06:49.566 --> 06:51.420
It's all right.

06:52.216 --> 06:54.235
You're gonna be okay.

06:55.604 --> 06:58.003
He's dead. He's dead...

06:58.243 --> 07:00.826
He's not gonna hurt you anymore.

07:42.415 --> 07:44.140
Frank?

07:50.227 --> 07:52.588
Can we have a little speak?

07:53.168 --> 07:56.312
How could she understand
anything that we say, you know.

07:56.313 --> 07:58.934
Her attacker seemed crazy.

07:58.935 --> 08:02.503
- Well, he was a homeless guy, right?
- Yeah, look like it.

08:02.517 --> 08:04.963
The funny thing...

08:05.233 --> 08:09.478
He had on a Patek Philippe...
you know and a

08:09.479 --> 08:13.542
clothes .. he had been ...
pretty high flying not too long ago.

08:13.543 --> 08:16.949
Yeah well. He was a thief
and a would-be slasher.

08:16.950 --> 08:20.231
Pretty sure.
Didn't have any ID on him.

08:20.308 --> 08:25.155
Guy looked out of it...
Crazy eyes, say that much.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.267
Well, "Who walks like a
duck and quacks like

08:27.280 --> 08:29.402
a duck, it's a duck
with a meat cleaver."

08:29.403 --> 08:30.503
Yeah.

08:30.683 --> 08:33.078
Anyway,
it's all in there, I think.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.822
Yeah, good job. Nice work.
You been to psych yet?

08:36.356 --> 08:37.456
All right, come on Charlie...

08:37.557 --> 08:41.524
No, no Frank, no no. This is standard op.
It's not my call. You gotta go down there.

08:41.923 --> 08:44.414
I mean, you just don't
ice some guy and then

08:44.427 --> 08:46.929
go home put your feet
up and watch QBC!

08:46.930 --> 08:50.515
You killed a psychopath.  I don't
care if he was trying to slice her up.

08:50.516 --> 08:51.856
It's gotta warp you.

08:51.857 --> 08:54.003
- So when we're finished here,
you gotta go down there.

08:54.004 --> 08:55.504
Come on Charlie,
for Christ's sakes...

08:55.505 --> 09:00.568
Frank, listen. This is
your first fatal OIS, right?

09:01.101 --> 09:03.389
- Yeah...
- Well, go down and see Branson, ok?

09:03.390 --> 09:07.258
And you don't come back until
you finish your psych session.

09:18.156 --> 09:20.778
- Hey, Frankie!
- Hey.

09:20.904 --> 09:24.010
I'm off track though.  I'm going
to go to the Admiral for a pint.

09:24.011 --> 09:26.893
- You in to take that edge off?
- No, no thanks.

09:26.894 --> 09:30.381
- Took a grinch, huh?
- Yeah.

09:30.945 --> 09:35.482
Hey Frank?  What's wrong with
her face?  What happened to her?

09:36.529 --> 09:38.846
How the fuck should I know?

09:38.847 --> 09:40.736
Kind a sad, huh?

09:41.833 --> 09:44.954
- Yeah.
- Hmm.  Come on.

09:45.392 --> 09:47.128
No!

10:44.709 --> 10:47.751
- Hi!
- Hey, Amy!

11:09.247 --> 11:10.906
Frank? Is that you?

11:14.569 --> 11:17.803
Frank's here.
No, I'll give you a call later.

11:17.804 --> 11:19.478
Yeah.  Bye.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.684
It's late.

11:27.408 --> 11:29.488
What's the matter?

11:35.005 --> 11:36.724
I killed a guy today.

11:41.169 --> 11:43.492
Jesus.  Frank...

11:50.192 --> 11:54.535
- You did what you had to do.
- Hey, I know that, God damn it!

11:58.977 --> 12:01.818
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

12:07.033 --> 12:09.504
The prince of darkness is home.

12:13.727 --> 12:17.577
- Are you hungry?
- Your son's always hungry.

12:25.203 --> 12:28.686
- Where are you going?
- Go wash this cut on my hand.

13:15.325 --> 13:19.989
- I don't mean to scare you.
- No, you didn't.  It's just...

13:20.200 --> 13:22.826
I had a shitty day... that's all.

13:27.853 --> 13:30.539
Come here.

13:54.664 --> 13:58.758
Mommy fix.

14:01.697 --> 14:04.647
Is there anything I can do?

14:06.815 --> 14:10.585
No.  No, thank you.

14:12.709 --> 14:15.671
It's been so long...

14:19.090 --> 14:22.946
Do you wanna try...?

14:28.789 --> 14:30.693
Sure.

14:30.694 --> 14:32.449
Yeah?

14:42.090 --> 14:45.543
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby...

15:39.147 --> 15:44.244
Stop!  What are you thinking,
you bastard?

15:50.479 --> 15:54.960
- Frank, how can I help you?
- Yeah... um.

15:56.673 --> 15:59.843
That girl that is... disfigured.

15:59.844 --> 16:05.101
One who... was with
the guy that I shot.

16:05.102 --> 16:06.350
The guy you had to shoot.

16:06.351 --> 16:08.596
Yeah, right.  That's what
everybody keeps telling me.

16:08.610 --> 16:11.310
So uh...
What's going on with her?

16:11.611 --> 16:14.456
Well, I can tell you
her name is Jennifer.

16:14.903 --> 16:17.851
We found it in a note
the guy had in his pocket.

16:18.384 --> 16:20.239
What did it say?

16:20.252 --> 16:22.117
That's just it. All
it said was "Jennifer"

16:22.118 --> 16:25.086
Like there wasn't
anything else he could say.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.972
- Do you know where she's from?
- No idea.

16:27.973 --> 16:29.903
Apparently she didn't
really have a home.

16:29.904 --> 16:33.238
She was with that guy and he didn't
have a permanent address either.

16:34.392 --> 16:36.300
Any idea who he was?

16:36.501 --> 16:38.187
Well, we thought he was a derelict,

16:38.188 --> 16:41.534
but it turns out he was actually a fairly
well to do businessman at one time.

16:41.535 --> 16:43.927
From upstate,
lost everything.

16:44.331 --> 16:45.978
His family won't even claim him.

16:45.979 --> 16:49.493
- You're kidding me.
- No!  And she's certainly not talking.

16:49.494 --> 16:51.851
Can't.
She's retarded, I think.

16:51.852 --> 16:54.757
Sorry...
Mentally challenged.

16:54.897 --> 16:59.361
Or at least I hope she is.  Poor thing.
I don't even know how much she understands.

17:00.110 --> 17:01.870
So where is she now?

17:01.871 --> 17:04.319
She's at Watkins island.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.739
Listen, I thought you
said she was retarded.

17:06.740 --> 17:08.079
What is she doing in that shithole?

17:08.089 --> 17:09.914
Hey, don't blame me, Frank.

17:09.915 --> 17:12.872
It's the system.
It eats its young, you know?

17:21.042 --> 17:23.030
Excuse me,
I'm Detective Spivey.

17:23.031 --> 17:25.567
I came about the girl
who was admitted last night.

17:25.568 --> 17:28.672
Great!
The creepy one.

18:00.176 --> 18:01.977
Jennifer?

18:12.628 --> 18:16.633
Jesus!  How did you get
that head on that body!

18:19.269 --> 18:21.441
You can't stay here.

18:21.644 --> 18:23.281
Come on.

18:25.098 --> 18:26.998
It's alright.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.517
Here it is. It's a...

18:35.226 --> 18:36.192
This is my place.

18:36.193 --> 18:40.392
This is uh...
This is where I live.

18:41.543 --> 18:42.898
And...

18:46.534 --> 18:50.414
You can stay for...
for a while...

18:59.769 --> 19:01.155
Okay.

19:01.635 --> 19:03.705
Okay, alright.

19:04.106 --> 19:05.259
Okay.

19:35.248 --> 19:36.461
Ruby?

20:06.499 --> 20:07.819
Tomorrow...

20:09.427 --> 20:12.106
I'll get you a place to stay.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.605
Jennifer.

21:59.432 --> 22:00.833
Frank.

22:17.271 --> 22:18.807
Jennifer?

22:26.005 --> 22:27.515
What are you doing here?

22:30.519 --> 22:32.616
Okay... ah.

22:41.325 --> 22:44.028
It's alright! It's alright!
Stop it!

22:44.605 --> 22:45.609
Fuck!

22:45.610 --> 22:47.544
What in the name of
the holy God is that?

22:47.545 --> 22:51.093
Her name is Jennifer.  She's the victim
of the guy that I shot the other day.

22:51.094 --> 22:52.147
She's no where to go.

22:52.148 --> 22:53.681
And you brought her here,
you brought her into our house?

22:53.782 --> 22:56.109
I just wanted to give her a place
to spend the night, that's all.

22:56.110 --> 22:57.765
She was in an insane asylum.

22:57.820 --> 23:01.823
Jesus!  Look at her.
She can't even speak.

23:02.227 --> 23:05.602
Just wanted to help her, that's all.
She's got nobody to give a damn about her.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.007
- What's wrong with her?
Was she born that way?

23:08.008 --> 23:10.451
- I don't know.
- She scared the hell out of me, Frank.

23:10.686 --> 23:14.107
She fucking awesome...
And she's got a great rack.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.921
You know, for a morlock...

23:15.922 --> 23:18.632
Hey!  She's a human being,
you understand?

23:18.633 --> 23:20.712
She's got nobody to care about
her, she got no place to go.

23:20.713 --> 23:22.730
- I'm going to find her a place to stay.
- She can't stay here.

23:22.731 --> 23:24.350
Look at her.  There's a reason
why she doesn't have a home...

23:24.378 --> 23:28.047
- It would be inhuman to abandon her...
- No, Frank.  She has to leave.

23:28.336 --> 23:31.055
Go ahead, find her a place,
but get her out of here.

23:31.056 --> 23:33.047
- Ruby!
- No!  Enough!

23:35.413 --> 23:37.678
Jesus...
Hey!

24:15.347 --> 24:17.822
Just don't know
where else to take you.

24:19.215 --> 24:23.678
Nobody cares...
Nobody wants to help.

24:23.779 --> 24:25.575
I don't know...

24:38.228 --> 24:39.878
Let's get out here...

24:50.642 --> 24:52.144
Jennifer...

24:52.245 --> 24:53.745
Please.

25:10.386 --> 25:12.600
Jennifer, please.
Please.

25:45.813 --> 25:47.580
What are you doing?

26:30.244 --> 26:31.854
Fuck!

27:16.186 --> 27:18.101
Well...

27:19.848 --> 27:24.975
- No one would take her?
- Can you blame them, Frank. Look at her.

27:26.032 --> 27:29.304
- She can't stay here.
- I can't leave her on the streets!

27:29.963 --> 27:32.677
Either she goes or I do.

27:32.678 --> 27:35.298
- Who's that lady?
- Not now, Amy.

27:39.411 --> 27:41.032
Jennifer?

27:43.341 --> 27:44.817
Jennifer?

27:49.662 --> 27:51.656
Just one more night.

27:51.657 --> 27:53.469
That's it.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.725
Jennifer?

28:07.217 --> 28:08.645
Jennifer.

28:09.529 --> 28:10.949
Jennifer?

28:12.888 --> 28:15.240
Jennifer?
Open the door!

28:15.241 --> 28:16.241
Frank.

28:16.706 --> 28:17.938
Jennifer?

29:38.588 --> 29:40.838
What do you want?

29:47.015 --> 29:49.221
Go away.

31:29.831 --> 31:32.284
Hi.
What is your name?

31:33.392 --> 31:35.620
Can't you talk?

31:36.254 --> 31:39.171
What happened to your head?

33:54.047 --> 33:55.862
Amy?

33:59.194 --> 34:00.506
Is that Amy!

34:01.089 --> 34:03.635
No!  No!

34:06.119 --> 34:10.199
What did you do?
What did you do?

34:10.793 --> 34:14.331
What did you do...

34:14.920 --> 34:17.972
What did you do?

34:46.525 --> 34:48.179
What did you do?

34:53.737 --> 34:56.458
What did you do...?

35:13.947 --> 35:18.594
FREAKS

35:19.879 --> 35:22.282
So, is that a deal?

35:22.283 --> 35:23.849
Will you take her?

35:23.850 --> 35:27.008
I don't know if she's
really just like you described.

35:27.209 --> 35:30.341
Oh yeah.
Could be interesting.

35:30.520 --> 35:33.633
She's... exactly how I described.

35:34.295 --> 35:38.845
And while all this going on,
where exactly will you be?

35:39.714 --> 35:43.560
Away...
for a few days.

35:45.125 --> 35:47.126
- Okay.
- These are the keys.

35:47.127 --> 35:50.164
Shouldn't take too long,
but you know...

35:51.291 --> 35:54.276
Listen, I'm going to need
some incentive to do this.

35:54.277 --> 35:57.324
What you're asking is breaking
and entering.  And I here...

35:57.325 --> 35:59.340
could get in trouble.

36:00.378 --> 36:02.478
No, don't worry.

36:04.164 --> 36:06.505
I'm a cop.

36:52.979 --> 36:54.844
Jennifer?

39:25.108 --> 39:27.072
Come on.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.194
Come here!

41:55.215 --> 41:58.350
There is a little town
not far from here.

41:59.321 --> 42:02.524
See if I can get a job or something.

42:09.904 --> 42:12.904
You stay here, okay?

42:37.226 --> 42:40.967
You won't do these things
while I'm away, will you?

42:51.711 --> 42:53.914
You stay here.

43:49.850 --> 43:53.054
HELP WANTED

44:05.493 --> 44:07.658
Can I help you?

44:07.659 --> 44:09.907
Yeah, I saw your sign out there.

44:10.409 --> 44:12.684
I don't think I've seen
you around here before.

44:13.001 --> 44:15.140
Yeah, I guess not...

44:15.644 --> 44:18.670
But I can sure use a job.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.957
- Well...
- Please, please.

44:22.999 --> 44:27.041
I mean... I can really use a job.
I mean, I can do anything.

44:27.081 --> 44:31.383
It's just... things have
been kind of tough, lately.

44:31.384 --> 44:33.615
Tough for everybody.

44:35.826 --> 44:39.446
I need someone to clean up
and then I can do some stock work.

44:39.447 --> 44:41.398
Yeah, I can do that.

44:41.498 --> 44:44.886
It's really more for a high school kid
or something.  I can't pay much.

44:45.689 --> 44:48.631
Whatever you think would be fair.

44:53.699 --> 44:55.929
Okay.
Can you start now?

44:55.930 --> 44:58.093
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Follow me.

44:58.094 --> 44:59.595
Jack?

44:59.931 --> 45:00.928
Yeah?

45:00.929 --> 45:02.958
This man is going to be
doing some work around here.

45:02.959 --> 45:04.981
Stay at the register while
I take him in the back.

45:04.982 --> 45:06.082
Okay, mom.

45:06.191 --> 45:07.628
This way.

45:40.746 --> 45:43.160
I got a job.

45:50.960 --> 45:53.742
A grocery store.

46:35.597 --> 46:37.742
What time am I suppose to be
at Richie's going away party?

46:37.743 --> 46:40.267
Ah, Juliet said around 7.

46:40.406 --> 46:44.634
- It's almost 7 now. I'll start closing up.
- Not yet, buddy.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.797
You're gonna be a
little late getting there.

46:46.798 --> 46:47.655
How late?

46:47.656 --> 46:51.907
Late. We got a lot of cleaning up to do
and I have to finish this inventory.

46:51.908 --> 46:53.413
Oh, come on, ma!

46:53.414 --> 46:55.645
That bum guy can finish up
the cleaning and...

46:55.646 --> 46:57.618
we can do the rest of
the inventory tomorrow.

46:57.653 --> 46:59.586
He's not a bum...

46:59.587 --> 47:04.313
That man is in trouble, and he has been
humbled and he's looking for a way out.

47:04.314 --> 47:07.558
And he's willing to work
to get back on his feet.

47:08.006 --> 47:11.216
And, we have to finish
this inventory tonight.

47:11.217 --> 47:14.501
Okay, but... Ricky said he
needs help with the bonfire.

47:15.372 --> 47:17.585
Any chance his sister
might be there as well?

47:17.586 --> 47:20.381
I don't know.
What about it?

47:20.781 --> 47:23.174
I'd be happy to work late, ma'am.

47:23.392 --> 47:25.549
You see, ma?
Can I go?

47:25.894 --> 47:31.511
- Well, okay.
- Thank you.

47:31.612 --> 47:35.567
- Can't think of anything better to do.
- Yes, thanks.

47:35.568 --> 47:39.298
- Hey, what's your name, sir?
- Frank.

47:39.432 --> 47:40.983
Thanks, Frank.

47:43.304 --> 47:46.247
Nice to meet you, Frank.
My name is Rose.

47:46.248 --> 47:48.769
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.

47:49.672 --> 47:52.202
You clean up pretty good, Frank.

47:53.143 --> 47:56.209
Thank you, Rose.
Thanks.

47:56.426 --> 47:58.994
Things gonna get a lot better,
Frank.  I just know it.

47:59.307 --> 48:01.585
I hope so.

48:02.407 --> 48:05.500
- Just gonna finish up...
- Alright.

48:41.932 --> 48:45.117
You're doing a good job.
Thanks.

48:46.564 --> 48:48.250
Thank you.

48:48.251 --> 48:51.836
It's been a while since
I was... good at anything.

48:54.691 --> 48:57.096
Where do you live?

48:57.630 --> 49:02.608
Little ways up in the woods.
We got a little house there.

49:02.609 --> 49:03.943
"We"?

49:05.935 --> 49:10.113
That's right...
My daughter is... with me.

49:11.163 --> 49:12.941
She is sick.

49:12.942 --> 49:18.074
Well, it's too bad.
The poor thing.  With what?

49:19.788 --> 49:22.401
You know what?
Not my business.

49:22.402 --> 49:25.116
Enough of it for today.

49:27.405 --> 49:28.801
Okay.

49:39.900 --> 49:43.214
Don't be such an idiot, man.
She totally knows you dig her.

49:43.215 --> 49:45.100
Ah, bullshit.

49:45.101 --> 49:49.027
He's right, man. Come on, you always
walking around on moon night and shit...

49:49.391 --> 49:51.305
No.  That's not even having
a moon night alright...

49:51.306 --> 49:53.298
That's what they call
"virgin singing backup."

49:53.311 --> 49:55.313
Well then, fuck you!

49:56.847 --> 49:59.654
Oh hey... Check it out.

50:03.663 --> 50:06.076
Hey look.
She's not my property.

50:06.077 --> 50:10.300
Still, man.  If I was you, I'd go
and kick his arse right now!

50:10.660 --> 50:12.693
Well you guys keep
the watch eye going on.

50:12.706 --> 50:15.150
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna go drain the beast.

50:15.151 --> 50:20.114
- Turn the thing was more like it.
- You're the fucking least!

50:31.364 --> 50:33.033
Hey?

50:38.197 --> 50:39.814
Hello!

50:51.754 --> 50:54.046
What's your name?

51:01.008 --> 51:02.351
Wait up!

51:06.383 --> 51:08.641
Where are you going?

51:10.412 --> 51:12.771
Please, don't run!

51:13.749 --> 51:15.741
Don't run away, okay!

51:16.790 --> 51:19.409
Please!
Wait for me!

51:23.306 --> 51:25.003
Please!

52:29.868 --> 52:31.509
Jennifer?

52:49.095 --> 52:50.502
Jennifer?

53:04.812 --> 53:06.124
Jennifer?

53:40.072 --> 53:41.430
Jack!

54:55.177 --> 54:57.177
No more, Jennifer.

54:58.419 --> 55:00.135
No more!

55:00.153 --> 55:01.591
Stop!

55:24.749 --> 55:28.194
Jennifer!

55:34.751 --> 55:37.181
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of this.

55:37.313 --> 55:39.680
You're gonna be okay.

55:42.359 --> 55:44.144
You'll be okay.

55:55.192 --> 55:57.075
You'll be okay.
