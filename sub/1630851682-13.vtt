AND YOUR HOST, JOHN MULANEY.

03:59.406 --> 04:18.858
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
JOHN MULANEY!

04:23.263 --> 04:29.102
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:29.102 --> 04:34.941
IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE HOSTING
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" FOR THE
FIFTH TIME.

04:34.941 --> 04:41.314
I THANK YOU.
FOR MANY, MANY REASONS, I'M
GRATEFUL TO BE HERE TONIGHT.

04:41.314 --> 04:47.620
AFTER A VERY COMPLICATED YEAR,
IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE IN
A PLACE THAT HAS ALWAYS

04:47.620 --> 04:53.560
EMPHASIZED SOBRIETY AND MENTAL
HEALTH.
SINCE I LAST HOSTED, DIFFERENT

04:53.560 --> 05:01.334
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.
I -- IN DECEMBER OF 2020, I WENT
TO DINNER AT A FRIEND'S

05:01.334 --> 05:03.370
APARTMENT.
BUT IT WAS NOT DINNER.
IT WAS AN INTERVENTION.

05:03.370 --> 05:08.608
FOR ME.
MY LEAST FAVORITE KIND OF
INTERVENTION.

05:08.608 --> 05:16.049
WHEN I WALKED IN TO MY
INTERVENTION, I KNEW RIGHT AWAY
THAT IT WAS AN INTERVENTION.

05:16.049 --> 05:20.220
DO YOU KNOW HOW BAD OF A DRUG
PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO HAVE IF WHEN
YOU OPEN A DOOR AND SEE PEOPLE

05:20.220 --> 05:23.156
GATHERED, YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS,
"THIS IS PROBABLY AN
INTERVENTION ABOUT MY DRUG

05:23.156 --> 05:27.394
PROBLEM"?
THERE IS NO OTHER REASON PEOPLE
WOULD BE BEHIND A DOOR.

05:27.394 --> 05:37.704
I WALK IN.
THERE WERE SIX OF MY FRIENDS IN
NEW YORK IN PERSON AND SIX OF

05:37.704 --> 05:39.739
MY FRIENDS OVER ZOOM FROM L.A.
AND I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE
THINKING, "HEY, IF THAT WAS ME,

05:39.739 --> 05:42.308
I WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE, "IF YOU'RE
SO WORRIED ABOUT ME, HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T FLY IN?"

05:42.308 --> 05:49.182
DON'T WORRY.
I SAID THAT SEVERAL TIMES.
I RANG THAT BELL AS OFTEN AS

05:49.182 --> 05:57.557
POSSIBLE.
I WENT AWAY TO A REHAB, WHICH
WAS A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE.

05:57.557 --> 06:05.565
I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT I WENT.
I WAS THERE FOR TWO MONTHS FROM
DECEMBER TO FEBRUARY 2020.

06:05.565 --> 06:14.741
I WAS THERE DURING JANUARY 6th,
THE INTERCEPTION.
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED ON MY

06:14.741 --> 06:21.047
WATCH.
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO
IT.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.683
WAS THERE EVER AN INSURRECTION
BEFORE I WENT TO REHAB?
NO.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.785
HAS THERE BEEN ONE SINCE I GOT
OUT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

06:25.785 --> 06:31.091
THEY WOULDN'T DARE.
THEY KNOW BABY JAY IS BACK ON
THE STREETS.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.393
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE THING
YOU DO IN REHAB, OKAY?
YOU SIT DOWN WITH A COUNSELOR

06:33.393 --> 06:36.363
AND YOU GO THROUGH YOUR CELL
PHONE AND YOU DELETE AND BLOCK
ANY DRUG DEALER'S NUMBERS, OKAY?

06:36.363 --> 06:39.065
IN SOME CASES, YOU REACH OUT TO
DEALERS AND YOU SAY, "PLEASE
NEVER CONTACT WITH ME AGAIN."

06:39.065 --> 06:41.101
IT'S CALLED "BREAKING UP WITH
YOUR DRUG DEALER."
SO I DID THIS ONE AFTERNOON.

06:41.101 --> 06:50.310
I SAT DOWN WITH A COUNSELOR.
I TEXTED MY MAIN DEALER ARVIN
FIRST.

06:50.310 --> 06:55.682
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID HIS NAME.
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.484
SO I TEXT ARVIN, AND I SAY,
"HEY, IT'S ME.
I'M DELETING AND BLOCKING YOU.

06:57.484 --> 07:00.887
I'M NEVER GOING TO BUY DRUGS
FROM YOU AGAIN.
I'M SOBER NOW."

07:00.887 --> 07:06.693
AND THEN I'M REALLY POLITE, SO I
DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO END THE TEXT.
SO I WAS LIKE, "BUT THANK YOU

07:06.693 --> 07:16.469
FOR ALL OF THE NIGHTS THAT
BECAME DAYS AND YOUR INSPIRED
PROFESSIONALISM."

07:16.469 --> 07:18.071
.
I SEND THE TEXT, ALL RIGHT?
BEFORE I CAN DELETE AND BLOCK

07:18.071 --> 07:21.775
HIM, HE TEXTS ME BACK.
HE GOES, "HEY, I'M SO PROUD OF
YOU.

07:21.775 --> 07:28.515
I'M SO HAPPY YOU GOT SOBER."
YOU KNOW, I
ONLY BOUGHT DRUGS TO SELL TO YOU

07:28.515 --> 07:35.855
BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GET
WORSE STUFF OFF THE STREET."

07:35.855 --> 07:43.797
I KNOW!
AND I'M BREAKING UP WITH THIS
GUY?

07:43.797 --> 07:49.102
SO I CAN'T BLOCK HIM NOW.
I TEXT HIM BACK, YOU KNOW?
AND I GO, "OH, MY GOD.

07:49.102 --> 07:55.508
YOU SWEET MAN."
I SAID, "YOU ONLY BOUGHT
DRUGS TO SELL TO ME?"

07:55.508 --> 07:59.512
HE SAYS "YEAH."
I SAID, "DID YOU SELL DRUGS TO
OTHER PEOPLE?"

07:59.512 --> 08:06.319
HE SAID "NO."
I SAID, "THIS IS A WEIRD TIME TO
ASK.

08:06.319 --> 08:12.726
BUT ARE YOU A DRUG DEALER?"
HE SAID, "NO.
I'M A PAINTER.

08:12.726 --> 08:27.474
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS."
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE NO
IDEA HOW I KNOW THIS PERSON.

08:27.474 --> 08:35.048
SO I TEXT HIM.
I GO, "HOW DID IT COME TO BE
THAT YOU SELL ME DRUGS?"

08:35.048 --> 08:42.422
AND HE WROTE BACK, "I DON'T
KNOW.
YOU JUST KEPT ASKING."

08:42.422 --> 08:47.160
I LIKE THAT STORY BECAUSE THERE
ARE MANY TALES OF DRUG DEALERS
WHO HAVE TURNED INNOCENT PEOPLE

08:47.160 --> 08:54.534
INTO DRUG ADDICTS.
I MIGHT BE THE FIRST DRUG ADDICT
TO TURN AN INNOCENT MAN INTO A

08:54.534 --> 09:09.049
DRUG DEALER.
LIFE IS A LOT BETTER AND HAPPIER
NOW.

09:09.049 --> 09:14.320
I HAVE A 12-WEEK-OLD SON.
I'M VERY EXCITED.
YES.

09:14.320 --> 09:21.027
HE'S A PRETTY COOL GUY FOR
SOMEONE WHO CAN'T VOTE.
HE HAS -- HIS LEGS ARE LIKE

09:21.027 --> 09:27.367
LITTLE CALZONES, AND I WANT TO
EAT THEM.
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT

09:27.367 --> 09:29.536
THE MOMENT I FIRST BONDED THE
HARDEST WITH MY -- WITH MY SON.
HIS NAME IS MALCOLM.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.438
WE'RE IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.
MY GIRLFRIEND GIVES BIRTH TO
HIM.

09:31.438 --> 09:38.345
AND HE'S CRYING A LITTLE.
AND THEY BRING HIM OVER TO THIS
WARMER.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.247
AND THEY PUT HIM UNDER
THIS WARMER, UNDER THIS REALLY
BRIGHT LIGHT THAT'S SHINING IN

09:41.247 --> 09:44.918
HIS FACE.
AND MALCOLM, HE'S LAYING THERE,
AND THIS LIGHT IS RIGHT IN HIS

09:44.918 --> 09:50.190
EYES.
AND -- AND MALCOLM, HE DOESN'T
CRY OR DO ANYTHING, HE JUST

09:50.190 --> 09:53.893
LOOKS AND HE GOES -- HE WAS
ANNOYED, BUT HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING.

09:53.893 --> 10:05.071
AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S MY SON."
A POLITE MAN IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE
SITUATION, BUT HE'S NOT

10:05.071 --> 10:07.107
GOING TO MAKE A FUSS.
AND IT WAS A SUPER BRIGHT LIGHT.
HE'D NEVER SEEN ANY LIGHT IN HIS

10:07.107 --> 10:10.276
LIFE.
LIKE -- AND I'VE SEEN MANY AND I
WAS LIKE, "THAT'S A BRIGHT

10:10.276 --> 10:12.112
LIGHT."
IT'S FUNNY -- IT'S FUNNY TO SEE
ON A BABY'S FACE THE

10:12.112 --> 10:16.282
EXPRESSION -- JESUS WITH THE
LIGHTS.
MALCOLM IS A VERY GOOD BABY, BUT

10:16.282 --> 10:21.855
HIS FAVORITE PASSIFIER JUST GOT
RECALLED, THOUGH.
IT'S SUCH A BUMMER.

10:21.855 --> 10:28.028
HE LOVED IT.
SO WE HAVE A DOZEN OF THEM.
WE STILL HAVE THEM ON A BASKET

10:28.028 --> 10:31.931
ON THE COUNTER.
AND I CAN SEE THIS LOOK IN HIS
EYES, ALWAYS LIKE, "OH, I WANT

10:31.931 --> 10:35.068
TO USE THOSE, BUT I CAN'T
BECAUSE THEY COULD KILL ME."
I'M LIKE, "WELCOME TO MY WORLD,

10:35.068 --> 10:51.251
HOMIE."
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A
GREAT SHOW.

10:54.988 --> 10:59.559
>>> THANKS AGAIN FOR TAKING MY
CASE.
>> HOW COULD I NOT?

10:59.559 --> 11:05.331
YOUR NEIGHBOR KEEPS A WILD
MONKEY IN A RESIDENTIAL
NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU GO OVER TO

11:05.331 --> 11:08.635
SAY "HI" AND GET MAULED.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
>> DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET A

11:08.635 --> 11:15.141
SETTLEMENT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
UNLESS WE WIND UP

11:15.141 --> 11:18.078
WITH THE WRONG JUDGE.
>> OH, YAY.
OH, YAY.

11:18.078 --> 11:22.782
ALL RISE!
THE HONORABLE JUDGE ZENGO
PRESIDING.

11:22.782 --> 11:26.086
>> YEP.
THAT'S A
TOUGH BREAK.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.089
WE GOT THE MONKEY JUDGE.
>> A MONKEY JUDGE?
>> YEAH.

11:29.089 --> 11:37.130
HE WAS APPOINTED LAST YEAR BY
THAT GOVERNOR WHO LOVES PRANKS
AND STRUGGLED WITH ADDICTION.

11:37.130 --> 11:42.736
>> PLEASE BE SEATED.
NO ONE LOOK ME IN THE EYE.
DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISES THAT I

11:42.736 --> 11:46.940
DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T FEEL CORNERED, SO WE CAN
BEGIN.

11:46.940 --> 11:54.781
I HAVE DECIDED TO ALLOW CAMERAS
IN THIS COURTROOM.
HOWEVER, IF I SEE MY IMAGE IN

11:54.781 --> 11:58.251
THE MONITOR, I WILL THINK
IT IS A RIVAL MONKEY AND I WILL
COMPLETELY LOSE IT.

11:58.251 --> 12:03.823
NOW, ALSO, LET THE RECORD SHOW
THAT I AM ALREADY VERY CLOSE TO
COMPLETELY LOSIN

12:03.823 --> 12:09.162
IN THE BLUE WITH THE GRAY.
PROCEED.
>> THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.231
MY CLIENT WENT OVER TO SAY
"HELLO" TO THE DEFENDANT AND HIS
PET MONKEY, GUMMO.

12:11.231 --> 12:16.503
>> NO GUMMO.
>> WHAT?
>> TENGO.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.772
>> YEAH.
I KNOW.
I'M TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT

12:18.772 --> 12:21.274
MONKEY.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
NO GUMMO.

12:21.274 --> 12:25.445
TENGO.
>> SHOULD I KEEP GOING?
>> YEAH.

12:25.445 --> 12:31.918
BUT I'M GOT TO THROW A LITTLE
SAND TO SHOW DOMINANCE.
>> ALL RIGHT.

12:31.918 --> 12:35.622
OKAY.
SO MY CLIENT WAS AT THE
DEFENDANT'S HOUSE WHEN OUT OF

12:35.622 --> 12:38.758
NOWHERE, HIS PET MONKEY GRABBED
HER HAT AND --
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,

12:38.758 --> 12:49.736
WHOA.
WAS IT THE SAME HAT YOU NORMALLY
WEAR, OR WAS IT ANY DIFFERENT?

12:49.736 --> 12:51.905
>> WELL, NORMALLY, I WEAR AN
ORANGE BUCKET HAT, AND THIS
TIME, I HAD ON A GREEN BASEBALL

12:51.905 --> 12:54.341
CAP.
>> LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, YOU
WALKED UP TO THIS MONKEY AS A

12:54.341 --> 12:57.444
DIFFERENT SHAPE AND YOU
EXPECTED, WHAT, HIM TO JUST BE
COOL WITH THAT?

12:57.444 --> 13:04.384
FOR YOU TO NOT FEEL HIS INSANE
BREATH ON YOUR FACE WHILE HE
BROKE ALL THE BONES IN YOUR BODY

13:04.384 --> 13:07.420
WITH THE STRENGTH OF 30 MEN.
>> WELL, HE'S IN A HANGING MOOD
TODAY.

13:07.420 --> 13:18.064
>> ARE YOU SURE?
HE'S SMILING.
>> NO, HE'S BARING HIS TEETH.

13:18.064 --> 13:25.739
>> IT'S HOPELESS.
SO WHO CAN REASON WITH A JUDGE
LIKE THIS?

13:25.739 --> 13:28.074
>> MAY THE DEFENSE APPROACH THE
BENCH IN A SLOW, DELIBERATE WAY
HOLDING A BIRTHDAY CAKE?

13:28.074 --> 13:35.982
>> THE COURT RECOGNIZES THE
SHAPE HE NORMALLY ASSOCIATES
WITH TREATS.

13:35.982 --> 13:40.286
>> AS I APPROACH, YOUR HONOR,
I'D LIKE TO NOTIFY THE COURT
THAT I AM WEARING PERFUME, BUT I

13:40.286 --> 13:43.289
AM NOT FRUIT.
>> THE COURT APPRECIATES THE
CLARIFICATION.

13:43.289 --> 13:49.596
I WILL TAKE THIS CAKE, AND I
WILL PLACE IT IN MY PILE OF
SHREDDED NEWSPAPER.

13:49.596 --> 13:57.003
AND I WILL ALSO TAKE THIS SHINY
THING.
LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT THIS

13:57.003 --> 14:02.842
SHINY
THING WAS HIS AND NOW IT'S MINE.
AND IT GOES IN THE NEWSPAPER

14:02.842 --> 14:07.047
WITH THE CAKE, SO NOW I HAVE WON
MANY THINGS AND I KNOW VISUALLY
WHAT I HAVE.

14:07.047 --> 14:10.750
>> YOU ARE THE ALPHA.
>> YES.
>> OBJECTION!

14:10.750 --> 14:13.887
YOUR HONOR, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT
YOU'RE FAVORING THE DEFENSE.
>> THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

14:13.887 --> 14:22.629
>> YOUR HONOR?
I LOVE JUDGE.
>> I LOVE YOU.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.665
>> I LOVE JUDGE.
>> YOU ARE BABY.
JUDGE LOVE BABY.

14:25.665 --> 14:30.870
BRING JUDGE BABY.
JUDGE LOVE YOU.
JUDGE FAVOR DEFENSE.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.107
>> COME ON!
>> YEAH.
WE MOVE TO REQUEST A NEW JUDGE.

14:34.107 --> 14:40.947
>> ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I'M
NOT COMPETENT?
TENGO MADE THESE PIECES MATCH.

14:40.947 --> 14:50.090
SURE IT WAS A BIT OF TRIAL AND
ERROR, BUT I DID IT.
I WON THE JUTE.

14:50.090 --> 14:57.864
I'M GETTING TIRED AND I FEEL
SLIGHTLY CORNERED AND THIS IS
ALL GETTING SO, SO DANGEROUS.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.165
SO I'M
JUST GOING TO DISMISS THE
ENTIRE --

14:59.165 --> 15:01.034
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I WOULD LIKE TO CALL A SURPRISE
WITNESS.

15:01.034 --> 15:06.639
>> UNLESS THAT SURPRISE WITNESS
IS A RATTY OLD STUFFED ANIMAL
FOR ME TO VIOLATE, I ASSURE YOU

15:06.639 --> 15:08.942
THE COURT IS NOT INTERESTED IN
BEING STARTLED.
>> WELL, I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS

15:08.942 --> 15:19.586
FOR YOU, JUDGE.
>> THAT SIDE WINS.
THAT SIDE WINS.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.456
>>> NEXT ON "MONKEY JUDGE,"
A PUBLIC URINATOR MARKED THE
WRONG TERRITORY GETS THE MAXIMUM

15:23.456 --> 15:25.525
PENALTY.
IT IS RIPPED CLEAN OFF OF HIS
BODY.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.827
IT IS RIPPED CLEAN OFF OF HIS
BODY.
MONKEY JUDGE.

15:37.904 --> 15:41.574
>> REBECCA, HI.
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE BOTH BUYING DOG
FOOD TODAY.

15:41.574 --> 15:47.347
>> WELL, NOT REALLY.
I'M BUYING BLUE RIVER DOG FOOD,
WHICH IS REAL FOOD WHICH MY

15:47.347 --> 15:51.584
GUNTHER REALLY APPRECIATES.
RIGHT, BUDDY?
AND HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED AT THE

15:51.584 --> 15:54.287
INGREDIENTS ON THAT BIG NAME
BRAND DOG FOOD YOU'RE BUYING?
>> IT SEEMED FINE TO ME.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.856
>> REALLY?
OKAY.
WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T YOU READ

15:56.856 --> 16:00.493
THEM OUT LOUD IN FRONT OF YOUR
DOG.
>> OKAY.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.663
CORN, CHICKEN.
>> GO ON.
CONTINUE.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.299
>> CORN GLUTEN MEAL.
>> SORRY, WHAT IS THAT "CORN
GLUTEN MEAL?"

16:06.299 --> 16:10.036
>> NO, I THINK YOU HEARD ME.
>> HOW MUCH DO YOU PAY FOR BLUE
RIVER?

16:10.036 --> 16:15.241
LIKE $80.
>> IT'S NOT $80, IT'S $73.99.
IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY 32 CENTS MORE

16:15.241 --> 16:17.377
A DAY THAN YOU WHAT YOU PAY
MONTHLY.
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

16:17.377 --> 16:21.581
>> ACTUALLY, IT IS.
IF YOU TAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN
THE PRICES BETWEEN THE TWO BAGS

16:21.581 --> 16:24.718
AND DIVIDE THAT BY 28.
28 DAYS IN A MONTH, RIGHT?
7 DAYS IN A WEEK, CORRECT?

16:24.718 --> 16:26.820
CORRECT?
>> CORRECT.
>> CORRECT.

16:26.820 --> 16:30.523
YOU AGREE.
>> I SHOULD BE GOING.
>> YEAH, OKAY.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.759
28.
28 DAYS.
4 WEEKS IS A MONTH, RIGHT?

16:32.759 --> 16:34.728
SO DIVIDE IT BY 28, WHICH WE
BOTH AGREED IS A MONTH.
>> YES.

16:34.728 --> 16:38.398
>> IT COMES OUT TO 32 CENTS A
DAY MONTHLY.
>> I GUESS I WOULDN'T BE

16:38.398 --> 16:41.067
BRAGGING ABOUT ALL THIS SAVINGS
BECAUSE IT IS NOT AS MUCH AS YOU
THINK.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.703
>> NO, THAT MATH DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE.
>> OH, YOU DON'T THINK SO?

16:43.703 --> 16:45.271
WELL, WHY DON'T WE ASK MY
HUSBAND.
DANIEL.

16:45.271 --> 16:49.476
>> OH, MY GOD, I DON'T CARE.
>> OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON FEEDING

16:49.476 --> 16:55.515
THAT TO YOUR FUR BABY, ARE YOU?
>> SHE LIKES IT, OKAY?
AND I'M SAVING MONEY.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.084
>> 32 CENTS A DAY MONTHLY?
THAT'S WORTH IT TO YOU?
FOR YOU DOG NOT TO BE ABLE TO

16:58.084 --> 17:05.658
WALK?
>> OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S --

17:05.658 --> 17:09.496
THAT'S WHY THE DOG HAS BEEN IN
THIS STUPID CART.
IT CAN'T WALK.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.665
BECAUSE OF THE FOOD.
THE DOG HAS JUST BEEN SITTING
THERE IN THE CART AND LIKE I

17:12.665 --> 17:19.039
THINK SUBCONSCIOUSLY I KNEW WHAT
THAT MEANT THE WHOLE TIME.
BUT I WASN'T EVEN READY TO SHOW

17:19.039 --> 17:21.641
THAT TO MYSELF, TO SHOW ME THAT.
>> OKAY.
LOOK, SHE CAN WALK.

17:21.641 --> 17:30.517
>> PEOPLE LIKE YOU SHOULD BE
HUNG IN A PUBLIC SQUARE.
>> LOOK AT ME.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.920
I CAN FIX THIS.
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE THESE
ANIMALS HAVE NO VOICE.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.390
WHO WILL BE THEIR VOICE?
>> YOU WILL.
REBECCA ANN BUSH, LOOK AT ME.

17:37.390 --> 17:47.934
LOOK AT GUNTHER.
LOOK AT PRIME TIME.
LOOK AT WANTON.

17:47.934 --> 17:55.308
LOOK AT ALEXANDER.
YOU ALWAYS, ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
THEIR ADVOCATES AND THEIR VOICE,

17:55.308 --> 17:59.546
MORE THAN ANYONE, ANYONE WHO
EVER LIVED.
>> I KNOW.

THAT PUTIN WENT THROUGH WITH IT
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
GOING TO BE A COLOSSAL MISTAKE.

38:08.254 --> 38:10.924

ALL THAT BUILD UP.
KIND OF LIKE HOW NBC STILL HAD
