WEBVTT

00:20.354 --> 00:25.316
Your weight is 113.9 pounds.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.908
You gonna make me hurt you?

00:34.535 --> 00:35.868
- No
- I didn't think so.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.365
Are you alright? Did I hurt you?

01:17.995 --> 01:19.203
Bob!

01:20.122 --> 01:22.957
Bob! What's wrong?
What happened? Talk to me.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.211
Oh, my God! OK, honey,
hang on, hang on.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.047
911, what is your emergency?

01:30.174 --> 01:33.926
Yes, we need an ambulance
at 10600 Xavier, unit 4-B.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.262
My husband can't breathe.

01:36.388 --> 01:40.266
Oh, my God, he's turning blue.
You have to send someone now, please!

01:40.392 --> 01:41.517
Hurry!

02:50.254 --> 02:52.421
You blow-dry your hair?

02:52.548 --> 02:54.549
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you up?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.384
You blow-dry your hair?

02:57.719 --> 03:00.012
Excuse me for actually caring
what I look like.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.807
I think the word you're looking for
is "obsessing."

03:03.809 --> 03:05.351
You've been at it for almost an hour.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.895
If you wanted in,
all you had to do was say so.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.106
I don't want in. I want sleep!

03:10.232 --> 03:13.276
It's about time you got up anyway.
It's almost 9:00.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.488
This isn't gonna work.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.325
- What?
- You staying here.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.829
You're kicking me out? After one night?

03:25.664 --> 03:28.499
Why, you think we should
try counseling first?

03:30.252 --> 03:32.336
Why do you want to sleep
on a couch anyway?

03:32.462 --> 03:35.756
You got money. At least
until the divorce is finalized.

03:38.510 --> 03:42.388
I'll be out of your hair tomorrow.
What's left of it.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.904
It was three days ago.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.364
My throat got really dry
and then my tongue

04:00.490 --> 04:02.575
felt like it was blowing up
like a balloon.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.785
I assume somebody
checked for food allergies.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.580
- The first two doctors both did.
- Next one said it was a panic attack.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.832
The one after that wanted
to take his tonsils out.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.627
The last one had no idea,
just referred us to Dr. House.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.045
It says the attack was preceded

04:14.171 --> 04:16.672
by some sort of
strenuous physical activity.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.008
- Yeah.
- What were you doing?

04:25.557 --> 04:26.933
Awesome.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.769
A sex fiend with a swollen tongue.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.688
Just think of all the places
I can make Foreman search.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.317
He's not a sex fiend.
He's a happily married man.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.693
No such thing.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.991
What are you doing?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.788
Testing a new caffeine delivery system.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.082
He didn't get his beauty sleep.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.919
Wilson's moved in and apparently
has unusually loud toenails.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.629
If they're into rape fantasies,

04:56.755 --> 04:58.506
S&M is on the menu as well.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.842
Neck trauma could cause vocal cord
paroxysms, which could cause choking.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.845
I didn't see any sign of
trauma, and they were remarkably open.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.180
I asked about STDs

05:06.306 --> 05:09.392
and they admitted participating
in a threesome a few months ago.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.269
A hundred bucks says they're
as miserable as the next couple.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.188
Another guy, or girl?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.732
Girl. His wife's college roommate.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.903
If he's not happily married,
I don't know who could be.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.407
They're looking for something. If you're
happy, you've got nothing to look for.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.450
His wife arranged it
for an anniversary present.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.161
If you ask me, if two people
really trust each other,

05:29.287 --> 05:32.790
a threesome once every seven years
might actually help a marriage.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.170
OK, I say we stop the DDX
and discuss that comment.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.548
I'll take the bet.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.553
Maybe the first doctor was right.
Food allergy explains the anaphylaxis.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.846
Could be neurological.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.682
Progressive bulbar paralysis
would explain the symptoms.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.685
No. ALS would affect his facial muscles
before his throat.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.729
What if the problem's not in his throat?

05:54.855 --> 05:58.232
That would be a little odd considering
that's where all his symptoms are.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.026
- Says who?
- The patient.

06:00.152 --> 06:03.863
And since most patients can't tell
their ulna from their anus,

06:03.989 --> 06:06.282
I'm guessing this guy also doesn't know
the difference

06:06.408 --> 06:08.117
between choking and suffocating.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.786
His throat might be fine,
his lungs might be messed up.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.290
Get more blood, a chest CT
and a body plethysmograph.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.751
Unless, of course, you think
we should be asking the patient

06:16.877 --> 06:18.044
where his anus is first.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.549
It feels like I have to urinate
and then when I try to go...

06:24.634 --> 06:26.594
Pull up your pants.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.681
- It's my prostate, isn't it?
- Nope, not your prostate.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.185
- Herpes.
- Herpes?

06:34.853 --> 06:36.937
Herpes. Your turn.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.733
If it makes you feel any better, half
the patients who come into this place

06:40.859 --> 06:44.028
- have some sort of crotch rot.
- No, it doesn't.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.656
Look, this is impossible.
I've been married for 20 years.

06:47.783 --> 06:49.283
Have you had any sex in those 20 years?

06:49.409 --> 06:52.369
- Yes, of course.
- Then that's how you got it.

06:52.496 --> 06:55.164
The only person I've had sex with
is my wife.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.583
Bummer.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.504
Take this once a day.
Tell your wife to do the same.

07:01.630 --> 07:02.880
It's not going to cure it,

07:03.006 --> 07:05.591
but it will lessen the frequency
of the outbreaks.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.051
But there must be some mistake.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.552
You got any kids?

07:08.678 --> 07:11.055
- Yeah.
- Any of them take guitar lessons?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.974
- No.
- Tennis? Art? Acting?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.560
My daughter does karate. Why?

07:17.229 --> 07:19.063
Give this to her sensei.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.400
- Oh, wait. Does your wife play tennis?
- No.

07:23.527 --> 07:26.654
That's what I figured.
Never hurts to make sure.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.198
For Miyagi.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.286
I'm gonna close the shutter now.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.248
I need you to pant, kind of like a dog.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.544
That's good. Keep going.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.298
Can I ask you a personal question?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.885
Uh, I guess.

07:50.011 --> 07:54.473
The threesome and the role-playing.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.934
Is that because things get boring?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.229
No.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.775
We just enjoy our fantasies.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.114
- Are you married?
- No.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.162
You can go back to taking
the deep breaths now.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.583
Marriages don't fail
because couples get bored.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.878
They fail because while they're dating,

08:24.004 --> 08:25.379
people pretend to be the person

08:25.505 --> 08:27.673
they think their partner wants,
and then...

08:27.799 --> 08:30.885
Well, there's only so long
you can keep that up.

08:32.304 --> 08:35.222
Maybe they are that person while
they're dating, but then they change.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.933
People thinking
their partner will change?

08:38.059 --> 08:40.477
That's another reason marriages fail.

08:44.107 --> 08:48.235
People don't change, at least
not in any way that really matters.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.994
I think you've had enough caffeine.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.331
You were right.
It's not his throat, it's his lungs.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.583
The plethysmograph revealed
decreased lung capacity.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.293
And the CT showed lung
scarring.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.296
It's definitely interstitial
pulmonary fibrosis.

09:07.422 --> 09:11.383
What's not definite is the cause.
There's no arthritis, no sarcoidosis.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.678
He's not on any prescription meds.
And he's a wedding photographer.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.223
So I doubt he got exposed to coal dust
or asbestos at work.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.226
- Cause could be idiopathic.
- Can't be idiopathic.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.144
Idiopathic means without a known cause.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.312
What I meant was that...

09:23.438 --> 09:25.606
What you meant was
you don't know what the cause is.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.317
Just say that and we can avoid
this conversation.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.070
No applause?

09:32.656 --> 09:34.782
- What's his current condition?
- Stable.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.575
- Well, then we can wait.
- Wait for what?

09:36.701 --> 09:39.370
For whatever you can't figure out
to cause something else.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.621
You know it's going to.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.915
It's possible the IPF
could just continue to...

09:50.715 --> 09:52.925
- There's something wrong with his skin.
- Do something.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.178
- Stop scratching. Let me look at it.
- I can't. This is driving me crazy.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.347
Stop scratching, so we can...
Make it stop!

09:58.473 --> 10:00.724
- OK...
- Make it stop!

10:00.850 --> 10:02.518
Make it stop!

10:11.528 --> 10:13.237
Now we've got
something to discuss.

10:13.363 --> 10:17.533
What causes both lung scarring
and the itchy, splotchy red blotchies?

10:17.659 --> 10:20.160
It's obviously not a reaction
to medication.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.870
We haven't given him any yet.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.123
Right. But what besides
what it's obviously not,

10:24.249 --> 10:26.125
can cause both lung scarring
and the splotches?

10:26.251 --> 10:27.376
Where are you going?

10:27.502 --> 10:30.629
To complete the second half
of the caffeine delivery system.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.550
Either talk louder, or get in here.

10:42.684 --> 10:46.270
Same color coming out as going in.
Do you think that's a marketing thing?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.314
A lupus could cause lung scarring
and a rash.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.733
Or could still be a food allergy.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.444
- We've already ruled out allergies.
- Did we?

10:53.570 --> 10:54.611
Where's Cameron?

10:54.738 --> 10:56.322
We're in the men's room.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.241
We need an allergy expert in here.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.707
- This can wait two minutes.
- You don't know that.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.501
Chase thinks that food allergy
should still be on the table.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.670
No, it wouldn't explain
the lung scarring.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.714
Some homeopathic studies
have found a connection

11:13.840 --> 11:15.883
between food allergies
and autoimmune reactions,

11:16.009 --> 11:17.551
which could cause lung inflammation.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.803
Yeah. And some homeopathic studies
have also found

11:19.929 --> 11:22.639
that ground-up spiders can cure cancer.
Can I go now?

11:22.766 --> 11:23.932
No.

11:24.726 --> 11:28.854
Lungs, skin, skin, lungs.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.981
Sklungs?

11:32.776 --> 11:34.443
Lungs, skin...

11:36.279 --> 11:37.863
...throat.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.494
Heavy metal toxicity.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.121
It explains the lungs, the itching,

11:46.247 --> 11:48.957
the swelling in his tongue and throat.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.336
I thought you didn't believe there was
anything wrong with his throat.

11:52.462 --> 11:56.131
I never said I didn't believe it. I just
said I had good reason to doubt it.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.466
And now?

11:57.592 --> 11:59.134
I have good reason
to doubt those doubts.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.970
The patient's a little old
to be chewing paint off the walls.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.181
Nor does he drink well water,
eat fish every day,

12:04.307 --> 12:07.059
or do anything else that could have
exposed him to heavy metals.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.062
He and his wife worked a wedding
at Cabo San Lucas last month.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.898
A lot of pottery in Mexico
is contaminated with lead-based paint.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.734
Now aren't you glad you joined us?

12:15.860 --> 12:19.113
Search their house, screen his blood
and hair for lead.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.032
Test for mercury and arsenic
while you're at it.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.035
And, Chase, find out
what the resort cooks with,

12:25.161 --> 12:27.496
if they repainted recently
or did any plumbing repairs.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.667
- But I don't speak Spanish.
- Then it'll be challenging.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.390
Good Lord, what is that smell?

12:47.350 --> 12:49.059
Stuffed pepper.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.980
Stuffed with what? Vomit?

13:03.324 --> 13:05.200
I thought you were going to a hotel.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.911
I found an apartment.
I can move in on Monday.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.372
- Is that fast enough for you?
- What's today?

13:12.417 --> 13:16.170
- Where'd you get all that stuff?
- Not from your kitchen.

13:16.296 --> 13:21.008
Don't you ever eat anything
besides canned soup and peanut butter?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.051
Don't you ever eat anything
that doesn't look like

13:23.178 --> 13:25.804
it's been rolled onto your plate
by a dung beetle?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.476
Try it.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.442
- It's good, isn't it?
- No.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.361
Just better than it looks.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.283
How much beans and rice
do you think you'd have to eat

13:46.409 --> 13:48.994
from a ceramic pot
painted with lead-based paint

13:49.120 --> 13:51.455
to get enough lead into your system
to damage your lungs?

13:51.581 --> 13:54.249
- Are we talking a child, or an adult?
- Adult.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.501
Then I would say a lot.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.378
You'd have to eat beans
every day for months.

13:59.422 --> 14:03.217
Now, why do you have a season pass
to the New Yankee workshop?

14:03.343 --> 14:06.053
It's a complete moron
working with power tools.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.388
How much more suspenseful
can you get?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.599
I'm... I was watching something.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.559
No, you were about to watch something.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.479
I'm watching something.
See the difference?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.858
If the water was contaminated,
wouldn't I be sick, too?

14:19.984 --> 14:23.028
People can metabolize toxins
at different rates.

14:23.154 --> 14:25.030
We'll test it to be sure.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.534
- Have you done any recent renovations?
- No.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.995
Have any problem with bugs or rodents?

14:32.121 --> 14:33.413
Just the occasional ant.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.708
Use bug spray?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.627
No, I hate the smell.

14:39.087 --> 14:42.631
Luckily both of us are pretty anal
about keeping things clean.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.675
Yeah, I can tell.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.564
You think ants are the problem?

14:58.690 --> 15:01.191
Can you stop stuffing your mouth
with pancakes for one second?

15:01.317 --> 15:04.319
These aren't pancakes.
These are macadamia nut pancakes.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.321
Wilson made them and they're amazing.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.407
She says she doesn't use bug spray.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.784
Like little silver dollar
slices of heaven.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.037
- Some ants are poisonous, maybe...
- Forget the 72 virgins.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.331
If I blow myself up
in a crowded restaurant,

15:16.457 --> 15:19.251
I'm going to be asking
for a plate of these babies.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.587
Was the ant big and red
or small and black?

15:21.713 --> 15:25.257
- Medium and brown.
- Halle Berry brown or Beyoncé brown?

15:25.383 --> 15:29.720
Is there a difference?

15:30.471 --> 15:34.975
Army ants could devour, dissolve
and eat a cow in a matter of hours.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.186
Australian Bull ants, on the other hand,

15:38.313 --> 15:41.398
nasty little bastards,
but more of a nuisance than a threat.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.067
- No surprise there.
- Beyoncé.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.570
Well, then that's not it.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.864
How much clay did he eat at the resort?

15:48.990 --> 15:52.242
It's a five-star, $400 a night place.
They don't cook with ceramic pots.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.493
Tox screen?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.579
No evidence of lead, mercury or arsenic.

15:55.705 --> 15:59.583
Run them again. Call the resort, find
some disgruntled employee to talk to.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.501
- Go back to the home...
- It's not heavy metals.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.795
- The symptoms say it is.
- The tests say it's not.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.964
Who you going to believe?
The symptoms or the test?

16:06.090 --> 16:09.176
- It could also be a food allergy.
- Cameron says it's not.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.345
If your test could be wrong,
why can't hers?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.640
His diet hasn't changed since he was
a kid. His favorite food is cornflakes.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.808
Which, I assume, he eats with milk,

16:16.934 --> 16:18.935
one of the most common
adult onset food allergies.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.314
Start treating him for lead poisoning.
It's the most likely heavy metal.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.734
And, yeah, you can test him for
allergies for dairy, wheat and legume.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.827
I am not having an affair
with my daughter's karate instructor

16:35.953 --> 16:39.956
- and I did not give my husband herpes.
- Find out where House is.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.837
If you're convinced it's allergies,

16:45.963 --> 16:48.090
why are you giving him drugs
to treat lead poisoning?

16:48.216 --> 16:49.633
We're not convinced of anything yet.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.052
I think I need something else,
this cream isn't working.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.720
We're doing everything we can.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.432
Sorry.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.309
No, no. It's not my back, it's my feet!

16:59.435 --> 17:02.104
I think I stepped in something
when I went to the bathroom.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.939
Oh, it's on my socks. It's burning.

17:07.485 --> 17:08.860
I don't see anything.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.406
Please, take my socks off!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:13.616 --> 17:17.494
- Ow! Stop! Stop! Stop!
- What did you just scratch him with?

17:17.620 --> 17:21.456
If there was an allergic reaction, it
would be on his back, not on his feet.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.333
Oh, it's burning,
please make it stop!

17:23.459 --> 17:25.794
We need some gabapentin in here.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.384
Excruciating pain
in the lower extremities.

17:32.510 --> 17:35.971
- Not a sign of a food allergy.
- Means there's a neurological problem.

17:36.097 --> 17:40.058
More significantly, it's yet another
classic sign of heavy metals.

17:40.184 --> 17:43.186
And I just did yet another
hair and blood test for lead,

17:43.312 --> 17:45.605
and everything else he could
have possibly been exposed to.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.858
They're all negative.
It's gotta be something else.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.317
- Lupus could cause...
- No.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.987
Lupus progresses slower.
There'd be joint pain.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.239
So it's not a typical case.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.992
- We should get an ANA.
- It's not lupus.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.578
The symptoms don't match.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.747
And the tests don't match heavy metals.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.842
It's happening again.
He's not breathing.

18:16.471 --> 18:19.264
Tongue swelling, airway's closing.
He's not getting any air.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.516
- His lungs are clear.
- We're gonna have to intubate.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.894
Try to relax, Bob.
This is gonna help you breathe.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.270
Oh, my God!

18:25.396 --> 18:27.063
He's gonna aspirate! Need suction!

18:27.190 --> 18:29.441
- What's happening?
- Suction.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.110
There's too much vomit. We're never
going to be able to intubate.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.363
- We're gonna have to trach him.
- He's not breathing!

18:59.138 --> 19:01.932
His urine has elevated
proteins and red blood cells.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.684
It's lupus-induced kidney failure.
If we don't start treatment...

19:04.811 --> 19:06.812
Heavy metal toxicity
could cause vomiting.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.523
So would lupus nephritis,
and it also causes tissue swelling.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.983
He's choking on his tongue,
not his feet.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.444
The corticosteroids we gave him
to control the inflammation

19:14.570 --> 19:15.779
can cause facial swelling.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.198
Still not his throat,
but you're getting closer.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.617
I'm doing an ANA and a serum
compliment.

19:20.743 --> 19:24.329
If you're so sure, why waste time
with tests? Just start treatment.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.581
Oh, no wait. We can't do that
because we already have

19:26.707 --> 19:28.124
and it's not working! Ergo...

19:28.251 --> 19:31.211
Corticosteroids aren't the only
treatment for lupus nephritis.

19:31.337 --> 19:34.881
We could also try cyclophosphamide
or immunosuppressants.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.218
Only if we confirm the diagnosis
with an ANA serum compliment,

19:38.344 --> 19:41.179
anti-DNA, IV pyelogram
and kidney biopsy.

19:41.305 --> 19:44.516
- So, now you suddenly believe in tests?
- The symptoms...

19:44.642 --> 19:47.102
The symptoms all point
to heavy metal poisoning.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.854
Yeah, we all get it.

19:48.980 --> 19:52.399
Unless you've got proof,
and can tell me which heavy metal it is,

19:52.525 --> 19:54.651
I'm starting treatment for lupus.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.285
Systemic lupus
erythematosus

20:03.411 --> 20:05.537
causes the immune system
to become hyperactive.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.664
Attack normal tissue.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.250
It could be what caused
the lung inflammation,

20:10.376 --> 20:11.793
as well as the swelling in his throat.

20:11.919 --> 20:15.130
And now what appears to be
damage to his kidneys.

20:15.256 --> 20:16.882
The treatment's usually steroids.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.925
But he's already on the steroids.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.802
If the tests confirm
we're on the right track,

20:20.928 --> 20:22.470
there are other medications we can try.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.139
And if those don't work?

20:24.265 --> 20:27.642
Well, lupus, it's a chronic condition,
but it's generally controllable.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.478
What do you mean, "generally"?

20:30.605 --> 20:34.441
In rare cases, it can cause
cardiovascular or renal failure.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.902
Cardiovascular and renal.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.404
That's the heart and the kidneys.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.115
- Right?
- Yeah.

20:53.711 --> 20:57.088
Don't worry, it'll be all right.

21:11.354 --> 21:12.604
Enjoying the salad?

21:13.272 --> 21:15.941
- There's no lettuce.
- I'm aware that there's no lettuce.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.193
But do you know
when I obtained this knowledge?

21:18.319 --> 21:21.655
Actually, I'm in the middle of
something. When I made it. For myself.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.325
Well, how was I supposed to know?

21:25.451 --> 21:29.120
Well, I was hoping
this might tip you off.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.706
That's kind of selfish, don't you think?

21:31.832 --> 21:34.042
I offered to make you some. You said no.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.044
That was before I tasted the pancakes.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.588
It's a compliment.
You should be flattered.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.090
Here.

21:41.926 --> 21:44.219
It's Mrs. Lambert's herpes test results.

21:44.345 --> 21:45.720
Mrs. who?

21:45.846 --> 21:47.472
You've told more than one patient

21:47.598 --> 21:50.350
his wife is sleeping with
his daughter's karate teacher?

21:50.476 --> 21:52.560
You wanna stir the pot,
you have to clean up the mess.

21:52.687 --> 21:54.562
What would you do if you got herpes?

21:54.689 --> 21:56.940
She's coming in at 5:00.
Don't make me come looking for you.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.109
I'd know what you'd do.
But I mean, a normal guy?

21:59.235 --> 22:02.737
And don't be calling in sick,
or saying that your team

22:02.863 --> 22:05.031
needs you for some kind of
emergency consult.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.702
He suspected that maybe his
wife had also been playing pickle games.

22:08.828 --> 22:12.122
He could just keep it on the down low,
just wait till she got infected.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.499
You'd give your own wife herpes,
just to shift the blame?

22:14.625 --> 22:17.627
He'd give his own mother herpes
if it got him out of clinic duty.

22:18.587 --> 22:21.923
Course, maybe it was the wife.
Maybe she was the one who...

22:28.055 --> 22:29.931
Where's Mrs. Nympho?

22:30.057 --> 22:31.182
She's waiting outside, why?

22:31.308 --> 22:33.935
- Go search her.
- What, you mean her medical records?

22:34.061 --> 22:36.855
If I meant that,
good chance I'd have said that.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.942
You think she's poisoning him?

22:41.068 --> 22:43.611
His symptoms should be getting better
the longer he's here.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.030
Instead, they're getting worse.

22:45.156 --> 22:48.950
So, either she's poisoning him,
or it's not heavy metals.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.619
We've done over ten different
heavy metal tox screens.

22:51.746 --> 22:54.039
Because there's no reason
to test for the other 30.

22:54.165 --> 22:55.665
They don't get into the air or food.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.625
They only get in you
if someone puts them in you.

22:57.752 --> 23:01.171
And the only way we're going to find out
what she's sprinkling on his cornflakes

23:01.297 --> 23:03.173
- is to search her.
- I am not going to accuse a woman

23:03.299 --> 23:06.217
of trying to murder her own husband
based simply on some paranoid theory.

23:06.343 --> 23:09.137
It's the only explanation. We've
eliminated every other possibility.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.431
We have not eliminated
every other possibility!

23:11.557 --> 23:13.099
Has he responded to the lupus
treatment?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.642
He's only been on it a few hours.

23:14.769 --> 23:16.561
He hasn't responded
because it's not lupus.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.939
It's not allergies, ALS,
arthritis or sarcoidosis.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.357
She's all that's left.

23:22.818 --> 23:23.985
Do it!

23:29.492 --> 23:30.658
Hi.

23:31.327 --> 23:32.577
I'm Dr. House.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.165
- Mind if I take a look in your purse?
- Why?

23:37.875 --> 23:40.043
Because I'm going to need
to search it and you

23:40.169 --> 23:42.837
for whatever you're using
to poison your husband.

23:43.798 --> 23:46.257
Why would I want to hurt my husband?

23:46.926 --> 23:49.928
Then you won't mind
if I search your things.

23:53.057 --> 23:54.307
Go ahead.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.319
You satisfied?

24:08.614 --> 24:09.989
Absolutely not!

24:10.116 --> 24:12.325
She agreed to let me search
everywhere else,

24:12.451 --> 24:15.036
- but this she says no to.
- Doesn't that tell you something?

24:15.162 --> 24:18.039
Yes, that she doesn't want
some lunatic doctor searching her vagina

24:18.165 --> 24:20.041
- with a flashlight.
- Cameron can do that.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.251
I am not going to...

24:21.377 --> 24:23.128
The woman hasn't left
since they arrived.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.130
Whatever she's using,
she's hiding somewhere.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.757
- She's not poisoning him!
- It's the only explanation!

24:27.883 --> 24:30.343
No, it's the only explanation
your twisted mind can come up with

24:30.469 --> 24:32.470
because you're angry
that you can't find the answer,

24:32.596 --> 24:33.805
and you're taking it out on her.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.598
And you are protecting
a complete stranger

24:35.724 --> 24:37.308
based on some
childishly romantic notion

24:37.434 --> 24:40.353
that people are all so happily married
they don't want to kill each other.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.564
- You're calling me childish?
- Grow up!

24:42.690 --> 24:45.567
Shut up! Both of you.
And stay away from his wife.

24:45.693 --> 24:48.653
Sorry, I'm not giving you permission
to assault someone.

25:09.049 --> 25:13.344
Let's see.
I'm thinking, Colonel Mustard,

25:13.470 --> 25:15.471
in the music room with a candlestick.

25:15.598 --> 25:18.683
There's no music room.
It's the conservatory.

25:18.809 --> 25:21.436
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.481
If we don't find out what she's using
and start treatment immediately,

25:25.608 --> 25:27.442
- he'll be dead in a week.
- If you're right.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.987
If Foreman's right, you'd have basically
raped an innocent woman.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.828
My wife fired the maid.

25:38.954 --> 25:42.707
Apparently she's getting rid of
everything that reminds her of me.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.544
- You did your maid?
- I was nice to our maid,

25:46.670 --> 25:49.464
which annoyed her, God knows why.

25:49.590 --> 25:53.551
- Maybe she was doing her.
- No one was doing her, all right?

25:53.677 --> 25:55.345
But you still feel responsible?

25:55.471 --> 25:59.224
Even though nothing or no one was
done, it's still your fault.

25:59.892 --> 26:03.436
I offered to keep paying her salary
until she found another job.

26:04.313 --> 26:07.774
But she refused to take any money
without doing any work, so...

26:09.443 --> 26:12.111
You want someone to clean
your apartment? It's on me.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.656
You're supposed to be moving out,
not moving more people in.

26:14.782 --> 26:17.492
She's not moving in, she's gonna clean.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.577
Maybe I should move out,
and the two of you could...

26:19.703 --> 26:20.912
Oh, God!

26:21.038 --> 26:23.164
- Oh, God, no!
- Call a code!

26:24.416 --> 26:25.833
Please!

26:27.628 --> 26:29.921
Charging 360. Give him Epi.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.174
Clear!

26:34.843 --> 26:37.095
- Still no pulse.
- Charging! Clear!

26:38.806 --> 26:39.931
I got a pulse.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.727
Pupils are reactive. You still with us?

26:44.853 --> 26:47.605
He was without oxygen for less than
a minute. It can't be hypoxia.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.565
Could be a stroke.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.276
Bob, can you hear me?

26:51.402 --> 26:55.405
- Back up.
- Bob, talk to me. Bob! Honey, please!

26:57.283 --> 26:59.158
Bob, can you hear me?

27:02.663 --> 27:05.039
- He's awake.
- Can you hear me?

27:06.917 --> 27:07.917
Honey?

27:10.671 --> 27:12.046
Honey.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.720
Yes, she is quite the little actress.

27:26.437 --> 27:28.646
So, let's say she's not poisoning him.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.691
There's nothing more to discuss.
We've got lung and kidney failure,

27:31.817 --> 27:34.485
neurological symptoms
and now, cardiac arrest.

27:34.611 --> 27:37.947
A systemic disease with multi-organ
involvement is the definition of lupus.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.116
Auto-immunosuppressants
aren't helping.

27:40.242 --> 27:43.161
We should start him on cyclophosphamide.
See if it makes a difference.

27:43.287 --> 27:45.788
Yeah, and interferon.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.958
Interferon isn't an approved treatment
for lupus.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.251
You're not still thinking...

27:50.377 --> 27:53.546
Interferon isn't an approved treatment
for heavy metal toxicity, either.

27:53.672 --> 27:57.508
True. But it's pretty much the only
thing we can do for a viral infection.

27:58.969 --> 28:01.763
- We didn't consider it because...
- Because it doesn't make sense.

28:01.889 --> 28:04.724
- There's no fever.
- Because he's got no immune system.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.643
Thanks to the immunosuppressants
you prescribed for lupus treatment.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.562
He didn't present with a fever, either.

28:09.688 --> 28:13.024
Because at that point, he was
a post-viral autoimmune reaction,

28:13.150 --> 28:15.777
which again,
thanks to the immunosuppresants

28:15.903 --> 28:17.612
you prescribed for lupus treatment.

28:17.738 --> 28:21.282
His immune system basically rolled out
the red carpet for the dormant virus,

28:21.408 --> 28:23.701
waking it up and turning it
into a present viral infection.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.411
Give him interferon.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.664
But if it is lupus,
interferon could make it worse,

28:28.791 --> 28:31.250
- suppress his bone marrow even further.
- Which is more likely?

28:31.377 --> 28:34.962
Rapidly progressing, acute onset lupus
in a patient already on steroids,

28:35.089 --> 28:37.673
or a team of doctors
missing a post-viral reaction?

28:37.800 --> 28:39.258
We didn't miss anything.

28:39.802 --> 28:44.013
Well, then I'm wrong. And you
shouldn't... give him interferon!

28:46.767 --> 28:49.268
Intravenous interferon has been shown
to be effective

28:49.395 --> 28:50.895
against some viral infections.

28:51.021 --> 28:54.649
But I thought you said it wasn't
an infection. You said it was lupus.

28:54.775 --> 28:57.276
The increasingly rapid progression
of the symptoms

28:57.403 --> 29:01.447
- has caused us to reconsider.
- And what if you're wrong here, too?

29:01.573 --> 29:04.867
- What if it's not a virus?
- There are risks with interferon,

29:04.993 --> 29:08.496
especially in a patient
who's already immunosupressed.

29:08.622 --> 29:13.459
Look, at this point, your lungs,
kidneys and heart are all failing.

29:13.877 --> 29:16.295
We really don't have any choice.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.539
I cheated.

29:53.584 --> 29:54.959
What?

29:55.794 --> 29:58.671
Ninth grade, Earth Science.

29:59.631 --> 30:00.756
Mr. Foley.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.887
I sat behind you,
so I could cheat off of you.

30:09.892 --> 30:13.394
And I let you cheat,
so you'd sit behind me.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.774
I thought we were going
to grow old together.

30:21.153 --> 30:24.489
- In ninth grade?
- No, tenth.

30:26.617 --> 30:29.160
What, you had to make sure
I put out first?

30:31.371 --> 30:34.874
No, I knew you'd put out
in the seventh grade.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.382
I love you.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.055
Yeah, I know.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.350
Say you love me.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.394
No.

30:55.521 --> 30:56.854
Why not?

30:59.024 --> 31:01.609
Because you're not dying.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.029
Say it anyway.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.077
You gonna make me hurt you?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.169
I love you.

31:31.682 --> 31:33.140
It's not working.

31:33.267 --> 31:36.018
Both his lungs and kidneys
are continuing to deteriorate.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.188
- Up the dose.
- We already have.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.524
- Apparently not enough.
- I don't think it's a virus.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.902
We've been running titers for everything
we can think of. They're all negative.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.618
- Increase the interferon.
- House.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.621
You got a better idea other than lupus?

31:56.331 --> 31:57.498
No.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.083
Then up the dose.

31:59.626 --> 32:02.670
Mr. and Mrs. Lambert's appointment
was over an hour ago.

32:02.796 --> 32:06.674
Sorry, I was sick. And my team
needed an emergency consult.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.763
Your wife has herpes.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.099
What?

32:15.892 --> 32:17.685
That's impossible, I don't have any...

32:17.811 --> 32:21.772
You haven't had an outbreak yet.
Don't worry, you will.

32:23.025 --> 32:25.818
- You rutty jackass!
- Me?

32:25.944 --> 32:28.321
I haven't been with anyone in 20 years.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.031
You're the one with the blisters
on his...

32:30.157 --> 32:31.949
Doesn't mean that he got it first.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.327
You don't need to have an outbreak
to spread the virus.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.246
Yeah, and you're the one always talking
about wanting more sex.

32:37.372 --> 32:38.623
From you.

32:38.749 --> 32:42.001
And maybe I'd get more if you weren't
getting it somewhere else.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.711
You two obviously
have a lot to talk about.

32:43.837 --> 32:45.504
Don't even think
of dumping this in my lap.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.633
There's gotta be some way
to prove that it's him.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.593
I'm sorry, there is no test.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.888
Either of you two
ever sit on a public toilet?

32:54.723 --> 32:57.183
- Well?
- Of course.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.144
Herpes can live for short
periods of time outside the body.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.188
Dr. House, you know
you can't get herpes...

33:02.314 --> 33:05.024
Some politically correct doctors
will tell you that it's impossible

33:05.150 --> 33:06.484
to get infected by a toilet seat.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.736
But they'll also tell you
not to use the same bath towels

33:08.862 --> 33:11.864
to dry your crotch and your face during
an outbreak. See the contradiction?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.949
I always use a paper cover.

33:14.076 --> 33:15.743
- Always?
- Yes, of course.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.662
What about you?

33:17.788 --> 33:20.873
No. I never knew.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.293
Oh, please. This is ridiculous.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.671
Damn, I was sure it was Miyagi.

33:26.797 --> 33:28.172
What?

33:28.298 --> 33:31.217
He could believe that you can get herpes
from a toilet seat,

33:31.343 --> 33:34.011
or he could be cheating on you
and just be happy to have an out.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.180
The toilet seat makes sense, doesn't it?

33:36.306 --> 33:38.224
Sure. But she'd only refused to believe

33:38.350 --> 33:40.476
such a well presented lie
if she were innocent.

33:40.602 --> 33:44.689
And since you both can't be innocent,
you rutty jackass!

33:44.815 --> 33:46.232
You!

33:47.693 --> 33:49.527
- Thanks a lot.
- My pleasure.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.987
Honey, wait. Please!

33:52.114 --> 33:53.656
Wow!

33:56.326 --> 33:57.660
Not bad.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.755
She has a family history of arthritis,
doesn't she?

34:09.881 --> 34:11.924
Yeah, she does. What does...

34:12.050 --> 34:13.342
Stop the interferon,

34:13.468 --> 34:16.053
and do another heavy metal screen,
only this time test for gold.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.888
You don't still think that she...

34:18.014 --> 34:19.473
Don't let her go to the bathroom.

34:19.599 --> 34:22.143
Why would you care if she...

34:22.269 --> 34:23.310
Hello?

35:03.143 --> 35:04.143
Oh!

35:04.269 --> 35:06.771
Hi, I'm Lady.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.901
- What did you do to my closet?
- I cleaned it.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.611
Dr. Wilson said that I could go ahead...

35:13.737 --> 35:16.572
It's not Dr. Wilson's closet.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.785
- Where's the wood box?
- Wood box?

35:20.911 --> 35:24.455
Yes, the wood box. It's made of wood,
and it's box shaped.

35:24.581 --> 35:26.916
It's been in the back of this closet
since the day I moved in.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.460
- I didn't see any kind of...
- You may not have seen it,

35:29.586 --> 35:31.629
but you've obviously moved it.
The question is where.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.714
Well, I did not move anything, I just...

35:33.840 --> 35:35.216
It was in this closet.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.676
Then you came,
now it's not in this closet.

35:37.803 --> 35:40.638
OK. What type of box?

35:40.764 --> 35:41.972
Wood! Wood!

35:42.098 --> 35:44.642
A brown wood box.
It's got a metal handle on the top,

35:44.768 --> 35:47.478
looks like a tackle or tool box.

35:47.604 --> 35:50.481
Ah, you mean the chest.
The one that's under the bed?

36:09.125 --> 36:10.960
Do you need to fix something?

36:21.263 --> 36:22.721
Thanks.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.812
Well, fine, then I'll go to one
on another floor.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.898
Actually, they're not working there
either.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.443
Every bathroom in the whole hospital
is out of order?

36:36.570 --> 36:39.947
Well, the water...

36:40.073 --> 36:41.991
I'm going to the bathroom.

36:47.289 --> 36:49.206
- Where is she?
- Had to go to the bathroom.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.541
I told you not to let her.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.543
What was I supposed to do? Tie her up?

36:52.669 --> 36:54.253
Why not? She likes that.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.934
What are you doing?

37:10.687 --> 37:12.563
Your hand is wet.

37:12.689 --> 37:15.816
Sorry, must be nervous.
I've got some bad news.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.153
What?

37:20.155 --> 37:22.990
The damage to your husband's lungs
is permanent.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.619
The kidney damage is reversible,
and with the right therapy,

37:26.745 --> 37:29.163
he should regain full
neurological function.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.999
Other than the fact that he's not going
to be running any marathons,

37:32.125 --> 37:33.918
he should be fine.

37:34.461 --> 37:36.712
But that's good news, isn't it?

37:36.838 --> 37:38.547
Not finished.

37:40.133 --> 37:42.092
When I was a kid,

37:42.218 --> 37:45.346
my dad was stationed
at a Marine base in Egypt.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.556
We were in the middle of nowhere

37:47.682 --> 37:49.516
and there was absolutely nothing
for a kid to do,

37:49.643 --> 37:51.602
except look for a mummy's tomb.

37:51.728 --> 37:55.481
You didn't want me to go to the
bathroom because you wanted to tell me

37:55.607 --> 37:59.777
my husband is going to be fine
and that you used to live in Egypt?

37:59.903 --> 38:02.821
I didn't have a problem
with you going to the bathroom.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.866
I just didn't want you
to wash your hands.

38:08.370 --> 38:10.496
I never actually found a mummy,

38:10.622 --> 38:13.707
but I did learn a fair amount
about the ancient Egyptians.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.460
For example, they discovered
that stannous chloride

38:16.586 --> 38:20.506
is not only great for toughening
ruby glass, but if it's mixed with gold,

38:20.632 --> 38:22.633
it turns bright purple.

38:29.724 --> 38:33.769
Now, either your fingers actually
are worth their weight in gold...

38:34.980 --> 38:37.398
...or you've been sprinkling
your husband's cereal

38:37.524 --> 38:39.733
with gold sodium thiomalate.

38:39.859 --> 38:42.528
It's an arthritis remedy.
It's rarely used here in the U.S.,

38:42.654 --> 38:46.699
but it's still popular in Mexico.
Gotta give you props.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.203
Never heard of anyone using gold before.

38:52.831 --> 38:56.375
It's almost poetic.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.254
That's ridiculous.

39:00.380 --> 39:03.507
Heavy metal tox screen for gold
was off the chart.

39:07.303 --> 39:10.180
- Why would I...
- Because you were trying to kill him.

39:11.016 --> 39:14.059
I'd love to know the why
behind that why.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.563
But you're not gonna tell me, are you?

39:18.940 --> 39:20.524
You're wrong.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.236
I love Bob.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.906
I never said you didn't love him.

39:33.621 --> 39:37.624
How could somebody do that?
Sit by someone's bedside day and night

39:37.751 --> 39:41.003
helping them, comforting them
and at the same time killing them?

39:41.129 --> 39:43.047
Maybe he was having an affair.

39:43.173 --> 39:44.965
Maybe she was having an affair.

39:45.091 --> 39:48.594
Or maybe she just gets her kicks out
of slowly sucking the life out of a guy,

39:48.720 --> 39:51.513
- watching him suffer.
- He must have done something to her.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.974
- Yeah, he had it coming.
- I didn't say he deserved it.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.727
The only thing he did wrong
was marry a sociopath.

39:56.853 --> 39:59.605
Or maybe she just got tired
of being married.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.858
Didn't want to admit
to family and friends

40:02.984 --> 40:06.070
that the marriage
everyone thought was perfect, wasn't.

40:06.196 --> 40:09.448
Shouldn't one of us stay with her?
What if she tries to run?

40:09.574 --> 40:11.575
Yeah, Cameron, go back there.

40:12.202 --> 40:15.037
It'd be weird if we were
all in the ladies' room.

40:44.609 --> 40:47.611
We started chelation therapy
with dimercaprol.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.573
Thrilled to hear it.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.701
His kidney function hasn't improved.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.620
It will.

40:56.746 --> 40:58.956
He's gonna need a lung transplant.

41:00.917 --> 41:03.961
He's becoming more attractive
by the minute, isn't he?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.381
You're pleased.

41:07.507 --> 41:11.468
You think you've proved
that every marriage is a mistake.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.387
Do I look pleased?

41:34.576 --> 41:36.368
Ignorance is bliss.

42:36.721 --> 42:39.181
You have one new message.

42:39.766 --> 42:42.434
Hi, this is Blake Hanson
calling for Dr. Wilson.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.478
I got a better offer for the apartment.

42:44.604 --> 42:46.188
I know I offered it to you already,

42:46.314 --> 42:48.357
so if you match the offer
you can still have the place.

42:48.483 --> 42:51.068
